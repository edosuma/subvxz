00:38.980 --> 00:44.259
When the value of the x coordinate is
equal to or less than the value of...

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.400
Why?

00:53.000 --> 00:57.500
I just put that up there as a joke.
That's probably the hardest
geometry equation in the world

00:57.500 --> 01:00.200
How much extra credit is it worth?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.779
Well, I've never seen anyone get it right
including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.000
I guess if anyone here can solve that problem

01:09.000 --> 01:13.661
I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open
another math book again for the rest of your lives.

01:22.461 --> 01:25.546
Max ? You want to try it ?

01:26.900 --> 01:31.300
I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?

02:08.043 --> 02:10.253
You got it

02:34.000 --> 02:40.100
You guys have it real easy.
I never had it like this where I grew up

02:40.500 --> 02:46.161
But I send my kids here. Because the fact is
you go to one of the best schools in the country

02:47.120 --> 02:48.800
Rushmore

02:49.100 --> 02:55.670
Now, for some of you it doesn't matter.
You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich

02:57.713 --> 03:00.800
But here's my advice to the rest of you

03:01.300 --> 03:07.972
Take dead aim on the rich boys.
Get them in the crosshairs

03:08.139 --> 03:10.000
And take them down

03:11.141 --> 03:17.700
Just remember. They can buy anything.
But they can't buy backbone.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.600
Don't let them forget that. Thank you.

03:30.034 --> 03:32.620
Are you free for graduation, Herman?
Maybe you could give us an encore.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.300
I don't give a shit.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.500
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.
The least these little pricks can do is
hear me out.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.135
I just wanted to tell you I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Your speech was excellent

03:56.000 --> 03:59.027
This is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway

04:10.862 --> 04:14.000
I really think
you're right about Rushmore.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
- What's his name again?
- Max Fisher

04:22.000 --> 04:23.900
He's a sharp little guy

04:26.300 --> 04:29.000
He's one of the worst students we've got

05:47.000 --> 05:50.077
We're putting you on what we call
sudden death academic probation

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
And what does that entail?

05:53.177 --> 05:57.000
It entails that if you fail another class
you are going to be asked to leave Rushmore.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.800
- In other words, I'll be expelled.
- That's correct

06:01.300 --> 06:03.000
Can I see some documentation?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.600
Too Many extra curricular activities, Max

06:14.056 --> 06:21.600
I don't want to tell you how to do your job
But the fact is no matter how hard I try,
I still might flunkanother class

06:21.600 --> 06:25.370
And if that means I have to stay on
for a post-graduate year, then so be it.

06:25.370 --> 06:27.602
We don't offer a post-graduate year.

06:28.277 --> 06:32.100
- We don't offer it yet.
- Just bring up the grades

06:33.857 --> 06:36.400
Do you remember how I got into this school?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.000
Yes, you wrote a play

06:39.700 --> 06:44.300
That's right. Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate

06:45.000 --> 06:47.451
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

06:47.451 --> 06:49.928
You read it and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.600
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it

06:56.176 --> 06:58.300
But I still might have to expel you

07:00.400 --> 07:04.200
Couldn't we just let me float by?
For old times' sake?

07:05.100 --> 07:07.400
I can't do it, Max.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.401
- They want to kick me out
- Oh, no. Not again. What are you going to do?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.571
The only thing I can do.
Try and pull some strings with the administration

07:22.700 --> 07:26.800
- Did you hear they're teaching Japanese next year?
- That's the rumor

07:27.400 --> 07:30.200
- And they're canceling Latin.
- What?

07:31.000 --> 07:35.963
I tried to get Latin canceled for five years
"It's a dead language", I'd always say

07:36.420 --> 07:39.258
Well, I guess they finally heard you.

07:54.188 --> 07:55.300
Excuse me!

07:56.700 --> 08:00.100
Could I see a list of all the people
who've checked out this book in the past year?

08:03.496 --> 08:05.000
Look at that

08:46.400 --> 08:52.600
I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both
and I believe they both get paid in the end

08:53.073 --> 08:55.200
But the fools first

08:55.800 --> 08:59.300
Chapter fifteen: The Lad with the Silver Button

09:02.700 --> 09:05.300
- Meet me on the corner in 10 minutes
- Where are you goin'?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Excellent! That's was Excellent!

09:30.690 --> 09:35.400
I told Mr. Calloway the other day
how fortunate we are
to have someone like you looking out for Dirk.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.800
I'm just trying to impart
some of the experiences I've accrued
to help him.

09:43.577 --> 09:48.831
This has my number on it

09:49.400 --> 09:52.000
- Hello, Dirk?
- Hi, mom!

09:58.049 --> 10:02.844
- How'd the math test go? 
- What math test?

10:03.177 --> 10:08.200
- No. Did you turn in your paper on the Berlin Airlift?
- Yeah, I got an extension.

10:09.224 --> 10:13.100
- So how did it go with Mrs. Calloway?
- We shook hands

10:13.200 --> 10:16.000
- Big Deal!
- And I gave her my phone number

10:16.400 --> 10:20.500
- Buchan said he'd have already banged her by now
- What?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.400
That's my best friend's mother he's talking about

10:27.400 --> 10:30.000
I thought that's why you picked Dirk
as your chapel partner.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.800
What are you, a lawyer?

10:36.100 --> 10:38.500
It's Max Fisher.
- Oh, hi!

10:39.419 --> 10:44.214
...

10:49.886 --> 10:53.300
What's the secret, Max?
- The secret?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.200
Yeah. You seem to have it pretty figured out

10:56.561 --> 10:57.900
I don't know.

10:59.761 --> 11:05.149
I think you just gotta find something you love to do,
then do it for the rest of your life

11:05.983 --> 11:08.000
For me, it's going to Rushmore

11:23.900 --> 11:26.400
Did you invite that kid to your party?
- Max Fisher?

11:26.400 --> 11:30.700
- There's gonna be girls there. I'd rather die
- Pull your head out of your ass

11:34.177 --> 11:37.428
Do vidjenja. -Bog, Max.
-Vidimo se sutra.

11:45.853 --> 11:48.106
May I see the back, please?

11:53.985 --> 11:56.487
- That's it
- Thank, you

11:59.031 --> 12:02.368
I need a signature on this geometry test

12:06.705 --> 12:08.457
I know...

12:08.400 --> 12:10.000
37%.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.380
I don't know what to do anymore

12:16.840 --> 12:23.805
It could have been worse.
You almost got the A

12:31.310 --> 12:36.000
Maybe I'm spending too much of my time
starting up clubs and putting on plays

12:36.000 --> 12:37.700
That's possible

12:38.600 --> 12:47.100
I should probably be trying harder to score chicks.
That's the only thing anybody really cares about.
Butit's not my forte, unfortunately.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

12:49.400 --> 12:54.500
You're like one of those clipper ship captains
You're married to the sea

12:54.500 --> 12:56.250
Yes, that's true

12:57.000 --> 13:00.100
But I've been out to sea for a long time

13:07.259 --> 13:09.928
Hello?
- Hi

13:19.436 --> 13:22.773
- I like your hat
- Oh, thank you

13:23.940 --> 13:26.359
You're a teacher here, aren't you?

13:28.862 --> 13:32.240
- And this is your first year at Rushmore
- Uh-huh

13:33.742 --> 13:36.700
How long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.800
- How old are you?
- 15

13:41.800 --> 13:45.044
- Since I was your age
- You're kidding

13:45.335 --> 13:49.088
- You should quit
- You're right

13:50.340 --> 13:54.844
And I should mind my own business

13:59.056 --> 14:03.602
- Where'd you go to school, by the way?
- Harvard

14:02.890 --> 14:10.065
Really? That's a coincidence.
My top schools where I want to apply to are
Oxford and The Sorbonne.But my safety is Harvard

14:10.525 --> 14:13.525
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you

14:13.525 --> 14:15.153
What do you want to study?

14:18.072 --> 14:23.400
I haven't decided for sure.
But probably a double major
in Mathematics and Pre-Med

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
What was your major?

14:26.000 --> 14:30.300
I didn't have a major. But my thesis was on
Latin American Economic policy

14:31.000 --> 14:34.963
Ah, that's interesting. Did you hear
they're not going to teach Latin here anymore?

14:35.722 --> 14:38.176
This was more like Central America

14:38.467 --> 14:41.300
Oh, Central America and whatnot

14:41.403 --> 14:46.765
But moving on, they're gonna cancel Latin.
They've got to make room for Japanese

14:47.892 --> 14:51.978
That's a shame because
all the Romance Languages are based on Latin

14:52.146 --> 14:56.315
- Yeah, they are
- Nihilo sanctum estne?

14:56.481 --> 14:59.000
What's that?
That's Latin, isn't it?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.279
What does that mean?

15:02.445 --> 15:05.491
Is nothing sacred?

15:12.705 --> 15:18.336
Sic transit gloria : Glory fades
I'm Max Fischer

15:27.635 --> 15:29.721
Sign here, please

15:38.978 --> 15:43.817
In summation, I have only one question :
Is Latin dead?

15:49.739 --> 15:53.992
- Radje ti prekini radit' sranja.
- Is that Latin?

16:01.600 --> 16:07.170
Never in my wildest imagination did I ever dream
I would have sons like this

16:09.131 --> 16:12.000
What does your dad do, Max

16:12.000 --> 16:16.930
He's a neurosurgeon at St. Joseph's Hospital.

16:17.513 --> 16:22.977
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain.
But he seems to enjoy it

16:24.477 --> 16:27.856
Oh, no! I got this one

16:28.773 --> 16:32.902
- You were in Vietnam, if I'm not mistaken?
- Yeah

16:33.986 --> 16:36.948
- You were in the shit?
- Yeah, I was in the shit

16:41.300 --> 16:45.600
What's on Sunday? Oh, that's right.
The Twin's birthday party

16:47.300 --> 16:49.000
Do you wanna come?

16:50.100 --> 16:56.590
I'd love to. Except I've already got
previous occupations to attend to.
Thanks for the invitation, though

16:59.384 --> 17:03.305
- Come work for me
- What do you mean?

17:03.596 --> 17:07.642
I mean, I could use someone like you

17:08.476 --> 17:13.606
I may not be rich, Mr. Blume
And my father may only be a doctor
But we manage

17:13.700 --> 17:14.896
112th

17:14.896 --> 17:17.200
Excuse me, Mr. Blume
Nice talking to you

17:19.500 --> 17:20.800
You're on the team?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.905
I'm an alternate

18:58.367 --> 19:00.000
Miss Cross?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.800
I thought I would just let you know
as per our conversation the other day...

19:03.800 --> 19:08.000
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance Languages.
I gave a little speech

19:08.000 --> 19:11.100
- I heard about this
- You did?

19:11.100 --> 19:14.048
I understand you made a very convincing argument.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.400
I thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're going to continue the Latin program.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.515
- I'm very impressed
- Thank you very much

19:26.182 --> 19:30.500
- You need an assistant?
- Do we get to have assistants around here?

19:30.600 --> 19:36.317
I doubt it. I'm on scholarship, though.
Academic scholarship. So I get to do odd jobs.

19:37.359 --> 19:42.948
- How did you decide to teach at Rushmore?
- My husband went here.

19:44.365 --> 19:47.365
I didn't know you were married.

19:47.365 --> 19:51.413
Well, he's dead now.
So I'm not actually

19:52.700 --> 19:56.293
- When did he die?
- Last year

19:58.546 --> 20:02.000
- My mother's dead
- I'm sorry to hear that

20:02.000 --> 20:04.884
She died when I was seven.

20:06.761 --> 20:10.430
So we both have dead people in our families.

20:14.476 --> 20:17.145
Now what's going on in here?

20:18.479 --> 20:21.732
These were just born

20:23.567 --> 20:26.696
I don't want any alloys.
I want steel.

20:27.195 --> 20:30.032
I don't give a rat's ass if he did

20:32.618 --> 20:34.619
Steel, Harry

20:35.453 --> 20:40.580
- You change your mind? You want the job? 
- No. But I've got an idea. And need some money

20:41.600 --> 20:48.900
Rushmore deserves an aquarium.
A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture
and students canobserve marine life in its natural -

20:48.900 --> 20:51.500
- I don't know. What do you think, Ernie
- Aquarium?

20:51.576 --> 20:58.000
- What kind of fish?
- Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas...

20:58.681 --> 21:02.400
- Piranhas? Really?
- Yes, I'm talking to a guy in South America.

21:02.400 --> 21:07.899
- What did Guggenheim say?
 - Nothing. I thought I should go to you first

21:08.608 --> 21:13.486
Because at this moment
I feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile.

21:13.821 --> 21:17.000
The more preparation I can do,
the stronger our case will be
when we take it to the administration.

21:17.100 --> 21:23.500
- How much money do you want?
- $35.000 for the initial plans

21:33.005 --> 21:35.841
- I'll give you $2500
- O.K.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.700
- Thank you
 - You're welcome

23:04.629 --> 23:05.900
Max?

23:07.256 --> 23:10.300
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure

23:10.968 --> 23:15.605
Has it ever crossed your mind that
you're way too young for me?

23:20.643 --> 23:24.000
It's crossed by mind that
you might consider that a possibility, yes.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.315
Not to mention you're a student...

23:26.400 --> 23:32.000
I'm not trying to pressure you into anything, Miss Cross.
I'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly.

23:32.446 --> 23:34.000
I just want to make sure...

23:36.300 --> 23:40.000
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes

23:41.869 --> 23:50.000
And the truth is neither one of us has
the slightest idea where this relationships is going.
We can'tpredict the future.

23:50.300 --> 23:53.500
- We don't have a relationship, Max
- But we're friends

23:53.500 --> 24:00.720
- Yes. And that's all we're going to be
- That's what I meant by relationship.
You want me to graba dictionary?

24:00.970 --> 24:08.436
- I just want to make sure we understand each other
- I understand. You're not attracted to me

24:09.486 --> 24:11.800
C'est la vie.

24:12.981 --> 24:20.362
- Max. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it
- If you say so

24:20.655 --> 24:23.449
All I'm getting is...

24:25.450 --> 24:29.205
I've never met anyone like you

24:29.912 --> 24:32.833
You can take that for whatever it's worth

24:34.793 --> 24:39.714
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you, either

24:43.342 --> 24:45.344
You haven't, have you?

24:47.929 --> 24:50.598
You want to shake hands?

24:51.058 --> 24:55.562
- I'm glad we had this conversation
- So am I

24:57.230 --> 24:59.300
I can't wear a wire!
They're feeling me up every day!

24:59.300 --> 25:02.360
Oh, Come on. You'll have complete protection

25:02.651 --> 25:06.237
I've heard that one before
I got to go put a dime in the meter

25:06.529 --> 25:09.529
Joe, put a dime in the meter for officer Serpico

25:09.529 --> 25:12.285
- If you agree to testify in open court...
- No!

25:12.534 --> 25:16.380
- No what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify

25:18.831 --> 25:21.375
I expect your gun and badge on my desk

25:23.600 --> 25:30.000
Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
You're going to follow this all the way
to the end of the line, where Igot to be.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So help me, God!

25:46.600 --> 25:52.571
What happened to the cannoli line?
You're supposed to say "Forget about it, Sanchez"

25:52.862 --> 25:55.800
I made a mistake, all right?
It doesn't make any difference, anyway

25:55.800 --> 25:58.368
Hey, I'm letting it go. But don't tell me it doesn't matter. Every line matters.

25:58.701 --> 26:02.747
- Get off my back!
- Don't fuck with my play!

26:14.132 --> 26:16.718
Max!

26:41.100 --> 26:46.369
- I thought the acting tonight was excellent
- Thanks. Well, it was better in rehersals

26:46.702 --> 26:49.702
I'll catch up with you later, Dad
I've got a dinner to go to

26:49.702 --> 26:52.334
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, cast and crew only

26:52.874 --> 26:56.094
- You need some money?
- No, Dad

27:02.601 --> 27:05.303
- Max, that was great!
- I'm so glad you could come

27:05.353 --> 27:08.400
I want you to meet a friend of mine
Peter Flynn. Max Fischer

27:09.600 --> 27:13.059
- Who's this guy?
- Peter

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I really liked your play
It was really cool

27:18.815 --> 27:21.200
What happened to your nose?

27:21.700 --> 27:24.236
I got punched in the place

27:24.412 --> 27:26.000
What's your excuse?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.906
Hey, arthur!

27:28.215 --> 27:30.400
- How you doing?
- Nice job

27:30.451 --> 27:34.000
- Am I going to get to meet your dad tonight, Max?
- Oh, no. The old man's on call

27:34.200 --> 27:38.000
Mr. Blume, I'd like you to meet Miss Cross
and I didn't catch this young gentleman's name

27:40.460 --> 27:45.460
- I like your nurse's uniform, guy
- These are OR scrubs

27:45.460 --> 27:47.006
OR they?

27:50.376 --> 27:55.110
- Well, they're totally inappropriate for the occasion
- Well, I didn't know we were going to dinner

27:55.114 --> 27:58.814
- That's because you weren't invited
- Take it easy, Max

27:58.814 --> 28:01.520
You're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda

28:02.396 --> 28:04.150
What's wrong with that? I can write a hit play

28:04.150 --> 28:07.000
Why can't I have a drink when I want myself?

28:10.100 --> 28:15.031
- So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross?
- We went to Harvard together

28:15.449 --> 28:18.300
And I wrote a hit play. And directed it
So I'm not sweating it, either

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting the check

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
No, you're not. Excuse me.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.700
I just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us.

28:27.700 --> 28:33.000
We only expected to be a party of three,
but somebody invited himself along. I apologize.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.259
- Quite all right
- OK

28:36.884 --> 28:40.500
- You're being rude, Max.
- No, I'm not

28:40.500 --> 28:45.700
I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play
And my dinner, which wasinvitation only

28:47.310 --> 28:49.854
- Would you like me to pass you the butter?
- Yes, please

28:51.231 --> 28:54.192
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

28:54.441 --> 28:58.362
You hurt my feelings
This night was important to me

28:58.595 --> 29:02.595
- How did I hurt your feelings?
- Oh, my god!

29:02.595 --> 29:05.753
I wrote a hit play

29:09.000 --> 29:11.292
And I'm in love with you

29:41.985 --> 29:45.363
- Hi
- Were you hiding over there?

29:46.247 --> 29:49.324
Didn't wanna distrupt class

29:50.227 --> 29:54.662
- What's that you're painting?
- That's a jelly fish

29:56.247 --> 30:00.000
- What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?
- Max wants to talk to you

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
- What for?
- To apologize, I think

30:04.000 --> 30:06.049
We should talk over here

30:09.017 --> 30:12.429
- He sent you here?
- Yeah

30:12.887 --> 30:17.058
- Are you his messenger?
- No. I'm his friend

30:18.684 --> 30:23.523
You were right
I shouldn't have allow him to drink

30:25.148 --> 30:31.153
I don't think I should see Max anymore
- He's not going to like the sound of that

30:31.405 --> 30:36.743
I know. But I think I let him get too attached

30:37.868 --> 30:42.663
- What do you think?
- Oh, I think you your did the best

30:46.876 --> 30:48.500
Tell him I'm sorry

30:58.471 --> 31:01.140
What's your first name?

31:01.932 --> 31:06.353
- Rosemary. What's yours?
- Herman

31:11.416 --> 31:13.200
He wrote you a letter.

31:13.700 --> 31:20.407
Dear Miss Cross, I would like to take this opportunity
to formly apologize for the events of night of the23th

31:20.657 --> 31:22.450
I am not accustomed to drinking alcohol.

31:22.450 --> 31:26.500
Please do me the service of
coming to the unveiling of a new venture
I have undertaken

31:26.600 --> 31:29.789
I hope you will attend, if possible.

31:30.082 --> 31:33.400
I remain your friend, Max Fisher.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.200
- Cut the music

31:43.000 --> 31:45.100
- What time is it?
- 1:15

31:48.821 --> 31:51.000
- Did you see her?
- She's not here

31:51.000 --> 31:52.600
Go check the classroom

31:52.700 --> 31:55.400
- Should we go ahead and take care of this tree?
- Let's wait a few minutes

31:55.400 --> 31:58.107
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Beck, good to see you

31:58.200 --> 32:02.236
This is where they're building the new aquarium
I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it

32:02.403 --> 32:08.575
- This is the baseball diamond
- I believe it's being relocated a few feet over

32:08.600 --> 32:11.452
Is it true the aquarium will have piranhas?

32:11.500 --> 32:14.538
- Where'd you hear that?
- My source indicated that it was a possibility

32:15.331 --> 32:19.000
- Yes, it's true but promises are very tricky
- Max

32:21.000 --> 32:22.700
- Bad news
- What's the story?

32:22.700 --> 32:25.200
- She has a substitute teacher today
- Why?

32:25.220 --> 32:29.000
- I guess she got sick
- You know she's not sick. Give me the phone

32:32.930 --> 32:35.974
Janet! Max Fischer.
Is Blume there?

32:36.641 --> 32:40.436
Oh, where is he?
Goddammit, he's supposed to be here

32:41.730 --> 32:46.483
I don't give a shit about barracudas
But fuck it. I'm building it anyway

32:47.800 --> 32:50.446
Max!

32:54.282 --> 32:57.000
- Hello, Dr. Guggenheim!
- What do you think you're doing?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.204
- We're having a fund-raiser for...
- Turn that damn thing off

33:00.600 --> 33:02.747
Tell me this isn't happening.

33:02.747 --> 33:05.000
I'd rather not have this conversation
in front of the crew.

33:34.084 --> 33:36.184
We have a new student with us today.

33:36.184 --> 33:41.900
His name's Max Fischer and he's actually asked
to say a few words to the class.

33:41.900 --> 33:47.613
- Max? You want to take it away?
- Sure. Thanks very much

33:49.874 --> 33:52.000
I just wanted to introduce myself

33:57.589 --> 34:05.513
I'm Max Fischer.
I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy,
which I recently got expelled from

34:07.223 --> 34:12.686
This is my first time in a public school.
And I know you probably think
I was born with a silverspoonin my mouth

34:13.062 --> 34:22.027
But I'm no elitist. I think you've got some great facilities
and I'm really looking forward to making thebest
of it over here at Grover Cleveland.

34:22.195 --> 34:29.118
One footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team.
I'm going to start one up.
Let me know if you'dlike to join

34:34.830 --> 34:36.750
- Max?
- Yes?

34:37.123 --> 34:41.670
Hi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.
I just wanted to tell you I liked your speech

34:42.213 --> 34:46.900
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before

34:47.600 --> 34:48.717
How unfortunate!

34:49.302 --> 34:53.847
The silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way
But I think I know how you meant it

34:54.556 --> 34:57.978
Do you know it?
I gotta go to class right here

35:14.866 --> 35:18.369
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

35:25.752 --> 35:28.000
- Hey, Max. How's it going?
- Terrible

35:28.000 --> 35:30.588
Tell me something.
When you talk to Miss Cross the other day...

35:32.000 --> 35:35.543
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second

35:35.543 --> 35:39.598
I got to tell you. I don't know what you see in her.
I don't think she's right for you.

35:39.889 --> 35:42.475
What's that supposed to mean?

35:43.718 --> 35:48.714
I mean, she's not that beautiful.
She's not that intriguing

35:49.556 --> 35:53.556
She has something you can put your finger on. But...

35:53.556 --> 35:56.862
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable.
But let's get to the point

35:57.238 --> 36:01.368
- Will she see me again? Yes or no?
- No

36:01.825 --> 36:04.078
I'm talking on the telephone

36:05.871 --> 36:09.081
Oh, Come on. That's rude.

36:25.222 --> 36:26.600
Hey, Fisher!

36:27.683 --> 36:30.143
You better beat it, sunnie

36:30.435 --> 36:37.500
You know, Fischer. I've been watching you.
Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk -

36:37.500 --> 36:40.526
- because his mother's a great piece
and then getting nowhere

36:40.944 --> 36:46.115
Like everything you do.
Big show. No results.

36:46.332 --> 36:51.000
What do you call getting a hand job
from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.796
A fucking lie?

36:53.413 --> 36:59.000
You think I got kicked out for just the aquarium?
Nah. It was the hand job.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
You wanna know something else?
It was worth it

37:06.300 --> 37:12.056
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner
And please apologize to what's his name for me

37:12.347 --> 37:18.811
- I will. Are you OK?
- I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore.

37:20.354 --> 37:25.234
I miss the seasons.
And watching the leaves change

37:25.858 --> 37:32.490
By the way, what time does the library close?
I got an overdue book to turn in

37:38.829 --> 37:40.832
That's your handwriting, isn't it?

37:42.373 --> 37:46.100
My husband gave me this book
when he came to visit to me when I was 13

37:46.200 --> 37:50.300
And he went to Rushmore.
So when he died I gave it to the library here

37:52.550 --> 37:58.597
- You remind me of him, you know?
- I do? How?

38:02.934 --> 38:09.000
- You remember you were in the Rushmore Beekeepers?
- Yeah. I was President of them

38:09.733 --> 38:11.535
He founded that club

38:19.073 --> 38:25.900
- Do you think we can be friends again, Miss Cross?
In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course, I do

38:26.747 --> 38:30.541
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

38:31.461 --> 38:33.462
Yeah. But I need a tutor

39:52.365 --> 39:53.546
OK! What else do we got?

39:58.789 --> 40:00.200
- Hi, Max
- Hello

40:03.675 --> 40:06.300
- What was your name again?
 - Margaret Yang

40:06.300 --> 40:09.880
- What are you doing seventh period, Margaret Yang?
- I have guitar lessons

40:10.500 --> 40:12.700
- Classical guitar or?
- Rock

40:12.700 --> 40:14.753
That's good. We can get out of it then

40:19.849 --> 40:23.269
Put Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.000
And bring a headshot, please

40:38.615 --> 40:42.000
- Hello, Herman.
- How are you, Rosemary?

40:42.000 --> 40:47.498
Fine, thanks. I just got home
and I'm having a little snack

40:48.750 --> 40:51.419
Having some carrots?

40:53.713 --> 40:59.651
- Nice house!
- Yeah, it isn't mine. I'm just sort of housesitting

41:04.054 --> 41:06.700
Were you in the neighborhood?

41:06.700 --> 41:12.000
Didn't Max have something planned for us today?
A trip to the museum or something?

41:12.300 --> 41:15.700
I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight

41:16.300 --> 41:18.800
Oh. That's right. His new play

41:19.527 --> 41:24.865
- He's really making a go of it over at Grover Cleveland
- Yeah. He's doing very well, isn't he?

41:27.700 --> 41:29.911
You want a carrot?

41:30.912 --> 41:32.830
Yeah. I'll have one of those

41:47.052 --> 41:49.721
I'll probably be seeing you soon

41:53.015 --> 41:56.569
Or we could go for a walk, if you like

42:06.819 --> 42:10.574
- Sure
- Well, this is nice, isn't it?

42:12.074 --> 42:16.411
Kind of brisk.
I'll just get a sweater. I'll be back in a minute

42:49.690 --> 42:53.570
- Dirk?
- I know about you and the teacher

43:04.412 --> 43:11.544
- Does Max know?
- No. And I don't want him to know.
I just want it to stop. Right now

43:12.045 --> 43:16.715
You're a married man, Blume.
And you're supposed to be his friend

43:17.050 --> 43:23.263
- Look, Dirk. I am his friend
- Oh, yeah. And with friends like you, who needs friends?

43:36.109 --> 43:38.235
Unlock it!

43:42.406 --> 43:44.781
Little Calloway!

43:50.288 --> 43:54.290
You're standing up for the wrong guy.
Fischer ain't your mate

43:54.342 --> 44:00.500
- What are you talking about, Buchan?
- He thinks your mum's good for a bonk
That's why hepicked you as his chapel partner

44:00.800 --> 44:04.200
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself

44:04.200 --> 44:13.516
- He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar
- Max never said that

44:13.516 --> 44:21.524
Yeah. I suppose you're right.
After all, the son of a brain doctor
doesn't need to impress anybody, doeshe?

44:23.108 --> 44:28.237
- The killing has got to stop, esse
It's getting too loco. No more gats
- Nigger, you're the crazy one

44:28.572 --> 44:31.616
People will be trying to kill you.
Are you talking about getting rid of your gun?

44:33.702 --> 44:37.247
- It's time, homey
- Kiss me, Little One

44:37.705 --> 44:42.375
Then he kisses her and we're out. OK
Is that for me?

44:42.426 --> 44:47.756
Dear Max, I'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out
that Mr. Blume is having an affair with MissCross.

44:48.297 --> 44:53.100
My first suspicions came
when I saw them frenching in front of her house
then I knew for sure whenthey went skinny dipping

44:53.100 --> 44:59.516
in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs
while you were taking a nap on the frontporch

44:59.765 --> 45:09.584
Why am I telling you this now?
Because you're such a good friend
Take care, pal. Fondly, DirkCalloway

45:15.280 --> 45:19.159
- How was she, Herman?
- Jesus Christ!

45:20.202 --> 45:24.204
Was she good? I bet she was.
Although I wouldn't know 'cause I never screwed her

45:27.374 --> 45:31.000
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap.
"Are you comfortable, Max?"

45:31.000 --> 45:37.499
- "I'll just be out back nude
getting hand jobs from the woman you love"
- We never went skippingdipping

45:37.592 --> 45:44.308
Sure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me
you didn't just walk out of her house
at twoo'clock in the morning

45:47.559 --> 45:49.563
I'm in love with her

45:52.231 --> 45:55.224
Well, I was in love with her first

45:56.525 --> 46:04.824
And all that crap about "I don't think she's that great"
"I don't think she's right for you, Max"
Thatwas all bullshit, wasn't it?

46:07.494 --> 46:13.800
- Do you think she's in love with you?
- I don't know

46:14.000 --> 46:18.221
Well, I guarantee you she's not
And she never will be

46:19.796 --> 46:21.673
Max!

46:25.092 --> 46:27.429
I saved Latin!

46:30.222 --> 46:33.224
What'd you ever do?

46:35.269 --> 46:40.082
On the planet I'm from
the sun only comes out once a year

46:41.857 --> 46:44.300
- That is why my skin...
- Excuse me!

46:44.857 --> 46:47.779
I just came by to thank you for wrecking my life

46:52.993 --> 46:55.000
Max, what are you doing?

47:11.592 --> 47:15.763
Hello? Mrs. Blume? This is Max Fisher
I have some information regarding your husband

47:25.814 --> 47:28.275
Thank you for meeting me

47:29.066 --> 47:31.152
You're welcome

47:32.569 --> 47:35.030
Would you like a sandwich?

47:36.449 --> 47:38.785
All right

47:40.911 --> 47:48.032
- I have a tuna, peanut butter and jelly
I'm sorry it's not something more exotic
- I'll take the tunafish

47:52.828 --> 47:54.965
Get to the point

48:11.400 --> 48:16.651
- And how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Blume?
- Indefinitely. I'm being sued for a divorce

48:17.402 --> 48:19.000
Shortie!

48:20.071 --> 48:25.409
- So can you tell me where the pool's located?
I might want to take a dip after I have the dinner
-It's on the roof, sir

51:03.800 --> 51:10.975
5'3", a hundred and twleve pounds,
black hair, glasses...

51:28.698 --> 51:31.575
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?
I got to go settle a score

51:31.742 --> 51:33.995
You think that's wise, Max?

51:46.157 --> 51:51.344
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Private property! You're trespassing!

51:54.764 --> 51:57.015
Wait a minute! Stop!

51:58.017 --> 52:01.604
Let's have a truce for a second
Truce! Truce!

52:12.238 --> 52:15.031
What's this all about?

52:15.907 --> 52:20.494
Did you say my mother gave you a hand job?
Did you say it?

52:20.700 --> 52:26.333
Who told you that goddamn lie?
Never mind. I know who said that

52:26.460 --> 52:31.000
- And I'm going to stick a knife in his heart
And I'm going to send him back to Ireland in abodybag
- He's from Scotland

52:31.030 --> 52:39.000
Well, tell that stupid mick
he just made my list of things to do today
I'm going to pop a cap in hisass

52:41.305 --> 52:44.100
So you received the package?

52:44.400 --> 52:50.606
Good. I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on

52:52.732 --> 52:59.114
- I never took you for an informer, Max
- What's that suppose to mean?

53:04.452 --> 53:09.831
She resigned this morning
Before I even got your little snapshots
So your latest attempt at sabotagehas backfired

53:10.081 --> 53:14.293
- But she's one of the best teachers you've got
How could you let her go?
- Why are you trying toget her fired?

53:14.543 --> 53:17.588
You stupid old fool!
I'm trying to win her back!

53:34.879 --> 53:36.679
Miss Cross?

53:36.679 --> 53:38.147
Hi, Max

53:44.028 --> 53:47.490
- You need any help?
- No. I have it. Damn it!

53:48.365 --> 53:52.495
- Here. Let me see
- No. Please, I don't think you should come in here

53:54.288 --> 53:58.332
Look. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings

53:58.340 --> 54:02.869
I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you
But... Please, Max

54:03.462 --> 54:07.716
- You honestly believe you love Blume instead of me?
- Yes

54:07.900 --> 54:10.844
You'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that

54:11.177 --> 54:14.514
If you don't stop, I'm going to lose it
I mean it!

54:16.099 --> 54:17.342
It's too late

54:22.188 --> 54:24.272
Wait, please

54:30.111 --> 54:33.100
- I got kicked out because of you!
- You got kicked out because...

54:33.300 --> 54:39.077
- Rushmore was my life. Now you are!
- No, I'm not

54:40.529 --> 54:45.892
What do you really think is going to happen between us?
You think we're going to have sex?

54:50.171 --> 54:54.841
That's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think?
- Not if you've never fucked before, it isn't

54:58.012 --> 54:59.700
Oh, my God

54:59.700 --> 55:06.100
How would you describe it to your friends?
Would you say that you fingered me?

55:06.100 --> 55:09.563
Or maybe I could give you a hand job
Would that put an end to all of this?

55:12.100 --> 55:14.700
Please. Get out of my classroom

55:23.784 --> 55:27.000
- Fischer, ya spotty fucker!
- Hey, Magnus

55:27.400 --> 55:29.600
Got any hand jobs lately?

55:36.712 --> 55:42.635
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your stepfather!
Waitin' for your mum so he can get a piece

55:44.511 --> 55:48.557
Your mind is as warped as your ear, Buchan

55:52.060 --> 55:54.228
Don't get nasty, brother

56:12.912 --> 56:16.464
We got him, Dirk. We got him

56:33.139 --> 56:35.483
Max?

56:36.808 --> 56:38.651
Hi, Mr. Blume

56:42.229 --> 56:45.023
You wanted to meet?

56:45.399 --> 56:51.700
- When?
- Right now. You said you wanted to put an end to this

56:53.240 --> 56:58.411
Oh. Yeah. I was going to try and
have that tree over there fall on you

56:58.911 --> 57:04.542
That big one? That would have flat me like pancake

57:05.151 --> 57:11.756
- What stopped you?
- What's the point? She loves you

57:26.478 --> 57:33.000
- She's my Rushmore, Max
- Yeah, I know. She was mine, too

59:55.861 --> 59:59.032
- Good night, Stan. Merry Christmas!
- See you next time

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:10.124
It's been nice having your company
here at the shop, Max

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:15.295
Have you put anymore thought into
giving school another shot?

01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:24.463
Max, I like being a barber. I'm good at it
But I always thought you'd try another line of work

01:00:25.263 --> 01:00:30.809
- You talked about being a senator or a diplomat
- Pipe dreams, dad

01:00:31.935 --> 01:00:34.814
I'm a barber's son

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.600
See you at dinner

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:04.214
- Hello, Dirk
 -Hi, Max

01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:10.000
- What can I do for you?
- I thought I might get a haircut
- We are closed

01:01:10.804 --> 01:01:16.267
Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
I threw rocks at you the other day
But I guess I should gonow

01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:27.401
Merry Christmas

01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:30.072
What in the hell is that?

01:01:47.462 --> 01:01:53.591
- So did you heard the news?
- I doubt it. I don't really follow the news anymore

01:01:54.302 --> 01:02:00.180
- Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke
- I'll send him a box of candy

01:02:00.723 --> 01:02:03.184
Maybe you ought to go visit him

01:02:12.317 --> 01:02:16.864
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in

01:02:21.368 --> 01:02:25.079
It's so good to see you

01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:31.126
These are glorious
Let me put them in some water. Have a sit

01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:37.132
- Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim?
Or can he not hear me?
-No, he can hear you

01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:48.049
Hello, old timer. It's Max Fischer

01:02:51.186 --> 01:02:56.856
- You probably can hear me because
I don't know if your brain is damaged so...
- What do you want?

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.000
Nelson?

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:12.288
- It's the first thing he said in 10 days

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:19.003
- Do you think he recognized me?
- No, I don't think so

01:03:41.313 --> 01:03:43.189
Hey, amigo

01:03:46.177 --> 01:03:48.100
So who gave you the shiner?

01:03:49.447 --> 01:03:54.450
Either Ronny or Donny.
But I can't tell the difference anymore

01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:58.954
Whichever one it was, it clocked you

01:04:00.039 --> 01:04:05.835
- Kids don't like their parents to get divorced
- I don't blame 'em
- Neither do I

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:25.000
- How is she?
- I really don't know

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.822
- Why not?
- I don't see her in 6 weeks

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.276
What happened?

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.000
She left?

01:04:35.195 --> 01:04:40.000
- She's in love with the dead guy, anyway
- Edward Appleby

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:48.623
She's fucked up

01:04:53.129 --> 01:04:56.172
- Adios, amigo
- Hey, you ok?

01:04:59.174 --> 01:05:02.053
I'm a little bit lonely these days

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:35.207
Max?

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:38.961
What are you doing here?

01:05:40.128 --> 01:05:44.507
- I don't know. Jesus!
They came at me out of no where. It was so sudden
- What?

01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:48.971
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?
I just got hit by a car

01:05:49.304 --> 01:05:51.723
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

01:05:52.765 --> 01:05:55.684
- What did you say?
- Come inside

01:06:07.903 --> 01:06:13.074
- So this is where it all happens?
- Oh, what happens?
- I wouldn't know

01:06:13.283 --> 01:06:18.997
- So why'd you dump Blume?
- That's none of your business

01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:24.210
I know it's not. But I was just hit by a car
I'm a little confused right now

01:06:24.326 --> 01:06:29.298
- I mean. I thought you dumped me for Blume
- I never dumped you because we were never going out

01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:33.425
Because it would help me
if you would talk to me for a minute.
And tell me what happened

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:49.233
Well. A: He's a married man
B: He hates himself

01:06:49.774 --> 01:06:57.264
- And C: He smashed your bicycle, didn't he?
- My previous bicycle. Yes

01:06:57.656 --> 01:07:02.411
- Well, what sort of person does something like that?
- I don't know

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.700
War does funny things to men

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:12.921
He thinks you dumped him because of Edward Appleby

01:07:14.462 --> 01:07:17.048
What does that mean?

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:20.803
Well, I mean. You live in this room

01:07:21.136 --> 01:07:24.389
With all his stuff. It's kind of...

01:07:25.722 --> 01:07:29.602
- I was married to him
- I know you

01:07:31.187 --> 01:07:41.700
I will say Edward has more spark and character
and imagination in one fingernail than
Herman Blumehas in his entire body

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.558
One dead fingernail

01:07:50.371 --> 01:07:53.881
Right. One dead fingernail

01:07:59.002 --> 01:08:01.338
How'd he die by the way?

01:08:02.214 --> 01:08:04.966
He drowned

01:08:05.343 --> 01:08:09.387
- How'd your mother die?
- She got cancer

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.645
Hold still for a minute, ok?

01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:29.154
- You're very pretty
- Thank you

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.210
Is this fake blood?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.515
Yes, it is

01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:06.854
You know, you and Herman deserve each other
You both are little children

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.566
Let me show you to the door

01:09:27.915 --> 01:09:31.545
- Goodbye, Miss Cross
- Goodbye, Max

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:56.775
Hey, I have a, I'm sorry about what I said
about your mom giving me a handjob

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:05.241
I know, Max. Sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass

01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:08.328
Hey, it's ok

01:10:13.749 --> 01:10:15.834
What's that?

01:10:18.211 --> 01:10:20.589
I don't know

01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:37.728
Nice landing

01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:44.944
What's that you got there?
A flight plan or something?

01:10:46.278 --> 01:10:51.449
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so
- Dirk, this is Margaret Yang

01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:05.753
I heard about your science fair project on Action 13
They said the Navy was going to buy it from you

01:11:05.753 --> 01:11:08.653
- No, not anymore
- Why not?

01:11:08.653 --> 01:11:11.008
- Because it was fake
- What do you mean?

01:11:11.592 --> 01:11:17.639
- I faked all the results
- Why?
- Because it didn't work. I thought it would but it didn't

01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:28.733
You were a real jerk to me. You know that?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.819
Sorry, Margaret

01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:37.782
Well. Anyway. Nice to see you

01:11:57.842 --> 01:12:00.761
Can I take over for a while?

01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:24.544
- Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume
- What can I do for you?

01:13:28.299 --> 01:13:30.000
What's this?

01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:40.601
That's the Perfect Attendance awards
and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore

01:13:40.893 --> 01:13:46.857
I thought you could choose which one you like more
and you could wear that one and I could wear theother

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:52.195
I'll take punctuality

01:13:55.072 --> 01:13:57.116
Come here

01:14:06.082 --> 01:14:08.834
- Thank you
- Come on inside

01:14:13.631 --> 01:14:16.300
Well, Well. Well...
Look what the cat dragged in

01:14:17.927 --> 01:14:20.053
- Sorry, I'm late
- That's OK

01:14:21.597 --> 01:14:26.767
I want you to meet somebody
Mr. Blume, this is my father, Bert Fischer

01:14:30.396 --> 01:14:35.066
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fischer
Mr. Fischer was my father's name. Call me Bert

01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:42.740
So Max tells me you need a haircut
I want to you sit down

01:14:52.374 --> 01:15:00.000
- I don't know, Bert
- Don't worry, Mr. Blume. It's a painless procedure
Maybe we throw in a shaveas well

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:07.395
Are you fine with that mustache?
Do you wanna keep it for a while?

01:15:10.765 --> 01:15:13.000
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.144
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so

01:15:15.479 --> 01:15:19.107
- Good, good
- Why?
- Cause we're going to need all of it

01:16:29.294 --> 01:16:31.337
She's not coming, is she?

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:36.217
It doesn't look good

01:16:37.217 --> 01:16:39.970
Ah, shit! What am I doing here?

01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:46.393
How the hell did you ever get so rich?
You're a quitter, man!

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.437
I paid eight million dollars

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:55.000
And that's all you're prepared to spend?

01:17:04.283 --> 01:17:07.283
I'm sorry you couldn't make it
to the little ground-breaking the other day

01:17:07.283 --> 01:17:10.839
It's kind of a shame, since he's building it for you

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.752
I never asked anybody to build me an aquarium

01:17:17.129 --> 01:17:21.216
- I'm not sure how that rumor got started
- Me, neither

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:29.723
- You think Edward Appleby would've built you one?
- Yeah. He probably would've if he had the money

01:17:30.099 --> 01:17:35.645
That's what I thought. Blume's got a little more
spark and vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

01:17:35.895 --> 01:17:40.900
- But the aquarium was your idea
- Well, I gave it to my friend

01:17:42.942 --> 01:17:45.942
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:49.782
Could you make the order out to Ready Demolition?

01:17:52.661 --> 01:17:54.496
Thank you very much

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:01.585
Make sure these don't get wet

01:18:03.878 --> 01:18:07.900
- I'll see you at 3:15
- Where you going?
 - Rushmore

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.135
I got one last piece of
unfinished business to attend to

01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:30.600
- Fisher, ya fuck!
- Hello, Magnus

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.782
I'd have shot you in the other ear,
but it got blown off a long time ago

01:18:35.115 --> 01:18:40.453
- Besides now we're even
- Not for long, kemosabe

01:18:41.788 --> 01:18:46.292
- I got a proposition for you
- Will you stick it up your mother's arse, ya little prick?

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:53.381
I've got to hand it to you, Magnus.
You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play?

01:18:56.551 --> 01:19:00.463
What's all this shite?
- Nothiong

01:19:02.765 --> 01:19:06.019
I think you're right for the part

01:19:22.074 --> 01:19:27.453
- I always wanted to be in one of your frickin' plays
- I know you did, mate

01:19:40.715 --> 01:19:43.968
It's gonna be exciting. My son, Max wrote it

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.931
I gotta go to hospital

01:19:49.891 --> 01:19:53.978
- My kid's gonna burn this place down
- You'd better believe it

01:19:55.145 --> 01:19:58.649
Klinci ce razvaliti
dvoranu. -l hoce.

01:20:11.201 --> 01:20:14.038
Turn it, turm it. That's it

01:20:24.213 --> 01:20:26.590
Hi, Herman

01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:32.596
Looks like Max pulled a fast one on us

01:20:43.313 --> 01:20:47.983
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me

01:20:48.235 --> 01:20:54.457
And I wanted to make a dedication
So I'll just say that this play is dedicated
to the memory of mymother, Eloise Fischer

01:20:56.492 --> 01:20:59.100
And to Edward Appleby. A friend of a friend

01:21:00.912 --> 01:21:08.793
Also you'll find a pair of safety glasses
and some earplugs underneath your seats.
Please feel free touse them. Thank you very much

01:21:55.545 --> 01:21:57.463
Let's rock, Esposito! Let's rock!

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:42.754
I'm OK! Go, go, go, go!

01:22:43.255 --> 01:22:47.884
- Take it easy, Dirk
- How much time we got, Wood?

01:22:48.175 --> 01:22:52.571
- Bring me some more ketchup very quickly, please
- This is gonna look stupid
- No, it's not. It'sgonna look real

01:23:10.821 --> 01:23:15.618
- Thank you
- You're welcome. Hold this one, too. OK?

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:24.542
So what do you think of Max's latest opus?

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.626
It's good

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:33.216
It's got a happy ending

01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:57.530
- Adios, Esposito
- Adios, Sarge. Say a prayer for Surf Boy

01:23:59.282 --> 01:24:02.242
Semper fi(Good luck), soldier
Semper fi

01:24:03.451 --> 01:24:09.999
Sic transit gloria
Maybe we'll meet someday when the fighting stops

01:24:13.835 --> 01:24:15.797
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out!

01:24:32.018 --> 01:24:34.230
Hello, Esposito

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.570
- Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?
- You bet I will

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.300
- Did Max send you an invitation?
- Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie

01:25:20.979 --> 01:25:24.482
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thanks you very much, Mrs. Yang

01:25:25.025 --> 01:25:29.000
I wrote a different version of the play two years ago

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.782
- But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore
- Oh, really? why?

01:25:33.032 --> 01:25:37.785
- No. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals
- A very good evening to you, Fishers

01:25:38.578 --> 01:25:42.332
Miss Cross, I'd like you to meet
my father, Bert Fischer. He's a barber

01:25:42.582 --> 01:25:47.086
- This is my friend Rosemary Cross
- Hello, Rosemary

01:25:47.377 --> 01:25:53.718
And, of course, you know Mr. Blume
I'd also like everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang
And this isMargaret

01:25:56.386 --> 01:26:00.306
I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage
It's clearly a safety hazard

01:26:00.557 --> 01:26:05.519
- Last year he tried to raise piranhas
- Yeah, I know he did that
What'd you think, Mr. Littlejeans?

01:26:05.653 --> 01:26:08.400
Best play ever, man

01:26:09.939 --> 01:26:15.069
- I thought I was very realistic performancer
- Yeah? Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' line

01:26:15.319 --> 01:26:19.741
- I didn't notice
- How are Ronny and Donny doing in military school?

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:22.410
- They love it
- Lucky Bastards

01:26:22.951 --> 01:26:29.289
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon
- No. I'm a barber. But a lot of people make that mistake

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:40.092
- You were incredible tonight, Margaret
You were that poor girl
- Thank you

01:26:40.425 --> 01:26:45.680
- I loved it when you grabbed onto
the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off
- That was totallyimprovised

01:26:46.555 --> 01:26:50.768
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course
- Can you do an Australian accent?

01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:53.300
I'm working on something that's set in the outback

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.231
I really feel like celebrating, you know

01:26:56.231 --> 01:27:00.568
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes. I'd love to

01:27:02.613 --> 01:27:07.951
- You're looking good, Bert
- Hello, Mr. Blume
- Hello, Margaret

01:27:08.159 --> 01:27:13.330
May I cut in? I haven't had a change to
cut a rug with your new girlfriend yet

01:27:13.998 --> 01:27:19.835
Yes, I am. Find your own partner, Mr. Blume
I'm spoken for

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.631
No, it's OK. He's my friend

01:27:29.427 --> 01:27:36.184
- Well, you pulled it off
- It went OK. At least nobody got hurt

01:27:38.126 --> 01:27:40.000
Except for you

01:27:41.605 --> 01:27:44.525
No. I didn't get hurt that bad

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.402
Come on, you two. Shake a leg

01:27:50.279 --> 01:27:52.279
You you like to dance?

01:27:52.279 --> 01:27:56.360
Yeah, but let's see if we DJ can play
something with a little more...
