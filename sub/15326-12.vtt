ISN'T HE GREAT?

00:03.461 --> 00:04.587
- I GUESS.

00:04.671 --> 00:05.630
I THOUGHT HE'D DO MORE...

00:05.714 --> 00:07.799
OR DO ANYTHING.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.259
- HE'S THINKING.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.137
HE'S COMING UP WITH
SOME REALLY COOL HOPPING MOVES.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.764
ANY MINUTE, ANY MINUTE.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.765
- HEY, STOP COVERING UP FOR HIM.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.685
IF THIS IS ALL RABBITS DO,

00:18.768 --> 00:20.895
THE CARTOONS WERE MISLEADING.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.566
- THAT'S A RABBIT.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.610
- NOTHING GETS PAST YOU, DOCTOR.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.612
- I MEAN,
WHERE DID IT COME FROM

00:29.696 --> 00:32.698
AND WHERE IS IT
GOING BACK TO SOON?

00:32.782 --> 00:36.035
- OH, WELL, MR. FLOPPITY
IS AARON'S CLASS BUNNY.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.328
DON'T WORRY.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.496
WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AFTER HIM
FOR THE WEEKEND.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.499
SO FAR, THE HIGHLIGHT
WAS WHEN MR. EXCITEMENT

00:41.583 --> 00:43.626
WAS CHEWING ON SOME LETTUCE.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.588
- BUT HOW COOL WAS THAT?

00:46.671 --> 00:47.672
- WHOSE BUNNY?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.632
- AARON'S.
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.968
I'VE BEEN BEGGING FOR A PET
FOR 14 YEARS.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.136

00:53.219 --> 00:54.554

HE'S GOING BACK TO AARON'S CLASS
ON MONDAY.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.766
- COME ON, GET ME A PET.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.142
I'LL CLEAN UP AFTER IT.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.268
I'LL PLAY WITH IT.

FOR THAT AGAIN.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.480
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE WE HAD JAMES.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.441
- IN MY DEFENSE, I WAS FOUR,

01:06.524 --> 01:08.067
AND I THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA BE A PONY.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.696
- I GOT TO GO TAKE AARON
TO SOCCER.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.989
- ALL RIGHT.
- COME ON, BUDDY.

01:13.072 --> 01:15.658
YOU CAN PLAY WITH MR. FLOPPITY
WHEN WE GET BACK.

DO ANYTHING COOL

01:18.620 --> 01:21.498

01:21.581 --> 01:23.374

01:31.299 --> 01:32.926

01:33.009 --> 01:36.721
UNLESS YOU'RE THROWING HIM.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.847
- I FOUND SOME MORE TOYS
FOR HIM.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.016
AND I BROUGHT
A CROCK-POT AND AN ONION.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.684
THAT'LL GET HIM HOPPING.

08:17.496 --> 08:18.748
- WHAT ABOUT ELEPHANTS?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.958
ELEPHANTS DON'T HURT BUNNIES.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.544
- NO ELEPHANTS.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.545
- CHICKENS?
- JUST BUNNIES.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.758
- MONKEYS?
- NOTHING BUT BUNNIES.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.092
- CHOCOLATE BUNNIES?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.093
- NO.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.179
REGULAR LIVE BUNNIES.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.097
- YOU SAID THEY WEREN'T ALIVE.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.017
- [inhales deeply]

08:38.100 --> 08:40.602
AARON, SWEETIE,
MR. FLOPPITY IS GONE.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.270
- GOT IT.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.107
DO TIGERS HAVE
THEIR OWN HEAVEN?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.150
- TIGERS?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.526
UH, YEAH, SURE.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.444
WHY NOT?

08:48.527 --> 08:49.528
- BUT THEY EAT BUNNIES,

08:49.612 --> 08:50.279
SO WHERE DO THEY GET
THE BUNNIES?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.113
- TIGER HEAVEN IS CATERED.

08:51.197 --> 08:55.660
PLEASE, I DON'T KNOW.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.163
- MAYBE THOSE ARE
THE BORING BUNNIES

08:59.247 --> 09:00.122
WHO WON'T PLAY WITH YOU.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.709
SO THEY HAVE TO GO
TO TIGER HEAVEN.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.753
- RIGHT.
OKAY, THEN.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.046
- MAYBE MR. FLOPPITY WENT THERE,

09:07.129 --> 09:09.298
AND NOW HE'S GETTING EATEN
BY A TIGER.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.008
I'LL BET THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.301
- [sighs]

09:12.385 --> 09:15.179
I'M GLAD WE HAD THIS TALK.

09:20.059 --> 09:20.977
- HEY, ERIC,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.144
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MR. FLOPPITY?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.647
HE WENT TO TIGER HEAVEN.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.315
- TIGER HEAVEN?
- YEAH.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.276
AND NOW HE'S GETTING EATEN...

09:28.359 --> 09:31.654
OR ELSE HE'S WITH SOME LETTUCE
AND CARROTS.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.822
- NUH-UH.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.324
MR. FLOPPITY'S STILL ALIVE.
- IS NOT.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.243
- WELL, THEN I GUESS
HE'S A ZOMBIE NOW,

09:37.326 --> 09:39.787
'CAUSE HE'S OVER THERE
IN HIS CAGE.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.663
- [screams]

09:41.747 --> 09:44.250
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

09:44.333 --> 09:46.252
TO FIND A PERFECTLY MATCHING
RABBIT

09:46.335 --> 09:47.503
ON SHORT NOTICE?

09:47.586 --> 09:49.839
I HAD TO BLEACH PART
OF THIS ONE.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.175
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
TO TELL YOUR KID A STORY,

09:53.259 --> 09:54.135
AND WE BOTH WOULD HAVE BEEN
HOME FREE.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.095
- WELL, I'M SORRY,

09:56.178 --> 09:57.346
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

09:57.430 --> 09:59.223
TO BE HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
WITH KIDS,

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
ESPECIALLY ABOUT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.684
- AND HOW MANY TIMES EXACTLY

10:01.767 --> 10:04.353
HAVE YOU BEEN
"HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD"

10:04.437 --> 10:06.105
WITH A ROOM FULL
OF EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.024
- WELL, I HAVEN'T, PER SE.

10:08.107 --> 10:08.607
- WELL, I HAVE, PER SE.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.487
35 YEARS OF RABBIT FUNERALS,
FISH FLUSHINGS,

10:13.571 --> 10:16.699
AND THAT CANDLELIGHT VIGIL
FOR THE MISSING GERBIL.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.535
- HEY, RABBIT FUNERAL.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.078
NOT A BAD IDEA.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.788
- IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.458
THE TEARS, THE QUESTIONS,
THE PARENTS,

10:25.541 --> 10:26.959
AND IT GOES ON FOR DAYS.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.296
TRUST ME, THE DALAI LAMA WOULD
STICK HIS HEAD IN AN OVEN.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.255
- BUT IT'S A PERFECT WAY
TO HELP CHILDREN DEAL

10:31.339 --> 10:33.758
WITH THE WHOLE IDEA OF LOSS.

10:33.841 --> 10:34.884
- A BETTER WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN

10:34.967 --> 10:36.677
TO KEEP THE RABBIT ALIVE
FOR THE WEEKEND.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.764
FORTUNATELY,
I WAS QUICK ON MY FEET,

10:39.847 --> 10:42.558
AND I TOLD THEM THAT, YES,
MR. FLOPPITY LEFT THIS WORLD,

10:42.641 --> 10:45.561
BUT HE MISSED THEM SO MUCH,
HE DECIDED TO COME BACK.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.980
- [laughs] SERIOUSLY?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.440
AND THEY BOUGHT THAT?

10:49.523 --> 10:50.983
- WELL, I HAVE A MINOR
IN SPEECH AND DRAMA,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.234
SO YEAH.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.487
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.405
- MRS. PHILLIPS,
I RETIRE NEXT YEAR.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.573
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,

10:57.656 --> 11:00.034
I JUST WANT TO TEACH KIDS
TO SPELL,

11:00.117 --> 11:01.827
TO FIND NORTH AMERICA
ON A GLOBE,

11:01.911 --> 11:04.121
AND NOT TO SHAKE ME
DURING MY NAPTIME.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.540
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.459
- FRANKLY, MRS. GOSNOLD, NO.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.753
CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN
TO TREAT THOSE WHO PASS

11:10.836 --> 11:11.837
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.422
THEY SHOULD LEARN ABOUT LIFE'S--

11:13.506 --> 11:15.716
- YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW ME HOME
WITH THIS, AREN'T YOU?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.761
YOU'LL GET YOUR FUNERAL.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.929
- YES!

11:20.012 --> 11:20.930
- BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE BODY.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.890
- AND YOU'LL HAVE IT.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.016
- WELL, JUST BOX IT UP
AND BRING IT IN.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.893
OH, AND IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE OF DAYS,

11:25.976 --> 11:28.562
SO DON'T BE STINGY
WITH THE AIR FRESHENER.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.735
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING
WITH ALL THAT FOOD?

11:34.819 --> 11:38.489
- CAN'T A BROTHER GET A SNACK
WITHOUT ALL THIS Q&A?

11:38.572 --> 11:39.407
- NO.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.616
AND WHAT KIND OF SNACK IS THAT?

11:40.699 --> 11:41.826
NONE OF IT'S COOKED.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.828
- THEN I'LL JUST TAKE AN EGG.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.956
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT A RAW EGG?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.124
- IT'S HEALTHY.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.625
BOXERS DRINK RAW EGGS,
DON'T THEY?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.293
- TRUE; ACTUALLY, IN COLLEGE,

11:51.377 --> 11:52.378
MY FRATERNITY BUDDIES AND I
USED TO DRINK RAW EGGS

11:52.461 --> 11:54.296
AS A MORNING-AFTER REMEDY.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.299
- MORNING AFTER WHAT?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.802
- BOXING.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.469
- OKAY, COOL STORY, DAD.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.555
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.181
LET'S DO IT TOGETHER.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.391
- WHAT'S THAT NOW?

12:05.474 --> 12:07.852
- COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.145
LIKE <i> ROCKY!</i>

12:11.272 --> 12:12.773
AND LATER WE'LL WATCH <i> ROCKY.</i>

12:20.865 --> 12:22.575
HA!

12:22.658 --> 12:23.951
- MMM.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.120
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.914
- ONE GULP.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.082
ON THREE.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.586
ONE, TWO--

12:33.669 --> 12:35.713
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
HELP THIS GO DOWN EASIER?

12:35.796 --> 12:36.338
SOME ONIONS,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.507
CHEDDAR CHEESE,

12:38.591 --> 12:39.633
AND SOME FIRE.

12:41.469 --> 12:45.264
- MY BEST FRIEND SQUEEZY
LIKES HIS EGGS OVER EASY.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.098
WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S RAW,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.183
BUT THAT WOULD RUIN MY RHYME.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.560
HERE YOU GO.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.769
DINNERTIME.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.230
OH, THAT WORKED.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.483
SQUEEZY?

12:57.276 --> 13:01.071
UH-OH.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.865
HERE, SQUEEZY.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.074
HERE, SQUEEZY.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.660
DON'T DO THIS TO ME, SQUEEZY.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
- ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S SOMETHING

13:10.623 --> 13:12.708
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
MR. FLOPPITY, OKAY?

13:12.791 --> 13:15.544
WHEN A PERSON OR ANIMAL'S TIME
IS OVER,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.546
IT'S OVER...FOREVER.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.548
- RIGHT!
UNLESS THEY MISS YOU.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.719
I LEARNED THAT IN SCHOOL.

13:23.802 --> 13:26.347
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.016
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT BUNNY
IN CLASS TODAY.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
SWEETIE, MR. FLOPPITY IS GONE,

13:30.809 --> 13:32.728
AND HE WON'T EVER
BE COMING BACK.

13:32.811 --> 13:33.896
- DO TIGERS COME BACK?

13:33.979 --> 13:37.024
- OH, WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN
THIS ROAD.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.193
- SSSSSSSSS.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.611
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY, JAMES?

13:40.694 --> 13:43.906
- IT'SSS ALL GOOD.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.407
JUST PLAYING
HIDE-AND-GO-SNAKE--

13:45.491 --> 13:46.742
SEEK.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.412
- SO I THOUGHT OF A NAME
FOR MY MOUSE.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.249
CHEDDAR. GET IT?

13:53.332 --> 13:56.210
- IT'S KIND OF IRONIC
THAT YOU'D NAME HIM AFTER FOOD,

13:56.293 --> 14:00.506
HIM BEING SO JUICY
AND BITE-SIZED.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.507
- HE'S SMALL NOW,

14:01.590 --> 14:02.508
BUT HE'S GONNA GROW,

14:02.591 --> 14:03.551
BECAUSE HE LOVES CHEESE.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.178
TIME TO EAT, CHEDDAR!

14:06.262 --> 14:06.971
OH-HO!

14:07.054 --> 14:08.931
- YEAH, HEAR THAT, SQUEEZY?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.766
TIME TO EAT CHEDDAR!

14:12.810 --> 14:14.019
- WHO'S "SQUEEZY"?

14:14.103 --> 14:18.107
- IT'S WHAT I CALL MYSELF
SOMETIMES.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.942
TRYING TO GET SOMETHING STARTED.

14:20.025 --> 14:20.901
- HMM.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.278
WELL, LISTEN, SQUEEZY,

14:22.361 --> 14:24.154
I NEED YOU TO RUN OUT BACK
AND GET MR. FLOPPITY.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.115
- YEAH, SQUEEZY MIGHT LIKE IT
OUT THERE.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.285
- I THINK SQUEEZY MAY BE SCREWY.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.371
- WHO'S SQUEEZY?

14:32.454 --> 14:34.957
- JAMES.
- WORKS FOR ME.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.959
AND WHERE DID YOUNG SQUEEZY GO?

14:37.042 --> 14:39.712
- OUT BACK PULLING
THE BUNNY OUT OF THE BIN.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.629
- WHY?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.339
WE MAKING LUCKY KEY CHAINS?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.801
- DAD! SERIOUSLY?

14:45.884 --> 14:48.470
- HONEY,
WE'RE BURYING MR. FLOPPITY

14:48.554 --> 14:50.848
SO THAT AARON'S TEACHER
CAN STOP TELLING THE KIDS

14:50.931 --> 14:52.975
THAT RABBITS TURN INTO ZOMBIES.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.603
- MAYBE IT'S TIME WE TALK
ABOUT HOMESCHOOLING.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.523
- DAD, STEPH...

14:59.607 --> 15:01.233
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.694
THE BAG WAS OUT THERE,
BUT THE RABBIT'S NOT IN IT.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.030
AND I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.156
- OH, MY GOD.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.741
HE MUST'VE BEEN IN SHOCK
BUT STILL ALIVE

15:08.824 --> 15:09.908
WHEN WE THREW HIM AWAY.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
- YEAH, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.957
SQUEEZY.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.042
SQUEEZY!

15:20.002 --> 15:22.713
MR. FLOPPITY!

15:22.796 --> 15:24.173
MR. FLOPPITY.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.883
- ALL RIGHT,
I LOOKED ALL AROUND THE YARD,

15:25.966 --> 15:26.967
BUT NO BUNNY.

15:27.051 --> 15:27.635
I DID HAVE A BIT OF A SCARE.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.011
I THOUGHT I SAW A SNAKE.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.263
- WHAT? WHERE?
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

15:31.347 --> 15:31.680
IT WAS JUST THE HOSE.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.475
- DANG.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.768
- ANY LUCK?

15:35.851 --> 15:36.685
- YES.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.353
I TAUGHT CHEDDAR TO ROLL OVER.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.229
CHECK IT OUT.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.150
TA-DA!

15:43.233 --> 15:43.817
ISN'T THAT COOL?

15:43.901 --> 15:45.778
TAKE A BOW, CHEDDAR.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.991
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT MR. FLOPPITY?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.201
- HOW ABOUT SOME APPLAUSE?

15:52.284 --> 15:55.162
CHEDDAR'S SHOWING YOU
HIS BEST STUFF.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.039
- GREAT.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.083
I MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT
HAVING A FUNERAL

15:59.166 --> 16:00.209
FOR MR. FLOPPITY,

16:00.292 --> 16:01.919
AND NOW I DON'T
EVEN HAVE A BODY.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.045
- YOU COULD...

16:03.128 --> 16:04.546
STICK AARON'S
OLD STUFFED BUNNY

16:04.630 --> 16:05.714
IN A BOX AND FAKE IT.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.715
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.091
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.052
BUT IT WOULD BE RIGHT

16:10.135 --> 16:12.179
IF I COULD MAKE IT
A LITTLE HEAVIER.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.558
- CHILDREN,

16:16.642 --> 16:18.352
I'VE GOT SOME VERY SAD NEWS

16:18.435 --> 16:19.269
TO SHARE WITH YOU.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.938
THIS MAY BE HARD
FOR SOME OF YOU,

16:21.021 --> 16:21.980
BUT I'M SURE MRS. PHILLIPS
WILL EXPLAIN IT

16:22.064 --> 16:24.858
IN A WAY THAT MAKES
EVERYTHING OKAY.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.192
YOU'RE UP.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.822
- UH, THANK YOU, MRS. GOSNOLD.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.531
IT'S SO NICE TO BE HERE...

16:30.614 --> 16:33.867
UNDER THE BUS.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.453
KIDS, I AM SO SORRY
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS,

16:36.537 --> 16:40.040
BUT MR. FLOPPITY HAS GONE
TO BUNNY HEAVEN.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.919
- THEN WHO'S THAT OVER THERE
IN THE CAGE?

16:44.002 --> 16:46.213
- WELL, THAT IS, UH...

16:46.296 --> 16:47.548
MR. FLIPPITY.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.758
HE'S MR. FLOPPITY'S BROTHER.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.427
HE CAME HERE TO HELP
YOU FEEL BETTER

16:51.510 --> 16:52.636
ABOUT MR. FLOPPITY.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.764
- BUT MRS. GOSNOLD SAID
THAT WAS MR. FLOPPITY.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.516
- YES, WELL, MRS. GOSNOLD
MADE A MISTAKE.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.810
[kids gasp]

16:59.893 --> 17:01.395
- OOH, LET'S NOT START
COUNTING MISTAKES,

17:01.478 --> 17:03.021
MRS. PHILLIPS.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.275
- ANYWAY,
WE ARE GONNA HAVE A FUNERAL

17:06.358 --> 17:08.609
SO THAT WE CAN REMEMBER
MR. FLOPPITY

17:08.694 --> 17:12.156
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.615
- IS HE REALLY IN THAT BOX?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.659
- OF COURSE HE IS.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT?

17:15.742 --> 17:16.827
- WHEN MY GRANDPA WAS
IN THE BOX,

17:16.910 --> 17:20.122
THEY LEFT THE LID OFF
SO WE COULD ALL SEE HIM.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.166
- WELL, THIS IS GONNA BE
A CLOSED-BOX FUNERAL

17:23.250 --> 17:26.962
IN ACCORDANCE
WITH MR. FLOPPITY'S WISHES.

17:27.045 --> 17:27.963
- WELL, I THINK HIS REAL WISH
MIGHT HAVE BEEN

17:28.047 --> 17:30.257
NOT TO BE TERRORIZED
BY A BALLOON.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.596
NOW, KIDS,
WE MUST NOT BLAME ANYONE

17:35.679 --> 17:37.139
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO MR. FLOPPITY,

17:37.222 --> 17:39.475
EVEN IF ONE PERSON WAS
RESPONSIBLE.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.769
- WELL, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
NOT TO BLAME SOMEONE

17:41.852 --> 17:43.312
FOR GIVING YOU CRAZY IDEAS,

17:43.395 --> 17:46.148
WHICH ONE PERSON,
WHO IS SUPPOSEDLY TRAINED

17:46.231 --> 17:46.648
IN HOW TO TALK TO CHILDREN,

17:46.732 --> 17:48.442
DEFINITELY DID.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.818
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.905
LET'S JUST TAKE MR. FLOPPITY OUT

17:52.988 --> 17:54.990
TO THAT RABBIT-SIZED HOLE
BY THE JUNGLE GYM

17:55.073 --> 17:56.867
THAT JANITOR LEONARD DUG FOR US.

17:56.950 --> 17:57.785
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL CARRY IT.

17:57.868 --> 17:58.786
- NO, I GOT THIS.

17:58.869 --> 17:59.787
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.829
- NO, I GOT THIS.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.164
[gasps]

18:02.247 --> 18:03.916
[kids screaming]

18:03.999 --> 18:05.209
NO, IT'S OKAY!

18:05.292 --> 18:07.961
I OPENED HIM UP AND STUFFED IT
FULL OF ROCKS!

18:08.045 --> 18:10.547
[kids screaming]

18:14.593 --> 18:16.512
SO HERE'S THE THIRD THING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

18:16.595 --> 18:18.639
ABOUT THE END OF LIFE.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.016
A LIVING THING ISN'T DONE LIVING

18:21.099 --> 18:23.185
UNTIL YOU CAN'T FIND A PULSE.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.853
AND EVEN THEN, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE IT A MINUTE.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.481
- WHAT IF IT'S A TREE?

18:27.564 --> 18:29.775
- GO TO BED.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.778
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MILK
AND COOKIES IF YOU WANT.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.946
- NO THANKS.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.865
COOKIES ARE STARTING
TO TASTE LIKE TRAGEDY.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.285
- HEY, PAL!
HOW GOES IT?

18:40.369 --> 18:41.495
- NOT RIGHT NOW.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.871
I NEED SOME TIME.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.084
- BUNNY TROUBLE?

18:47.167 --> 18:48.877
- YOU KNOW THE FIVE STAGES
OF GRIEF?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.712
I THINK I ADDED A COUPLE.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.964
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.675
TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF
WITH KIDS IS REALLY HARD.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.717
- BUT YOU DID IT.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.094
NOW YOU'LL HAVE THE WIND
AT YOUR BACK

18:57.177 --> 18:57.678
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO HAVE THE SEX TALK.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.221
- WAIT, WHAT?

18:59.304 --> 19:02.266
- DAD, CAN YOU LEND ME
THE KEY TO THE SHED

19:02.349 --> 19:02.850
AND THE BIG FLASHLIGHT?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.768
- LOOK AT YOU.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.229
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT
FINDING THAT RABBIT.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.605
- FINDING WHAT?

19:08.689 --> 19:12.693
OH, YEAH, MR. RABBITY.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.444
- COME ON, I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.613
- [gasps] AW!

19:16.697 --> 19:19.491
MR. FLOPPITY!

19:19.575 --> 19:20.242
- THE BUNNY'S ALIVE!

19:20.325 --> 19:21.827
MY SNAKE DIDN'T EAT HIM!

19:22.661 --> 19:24.580
- A SNAKE?

19:24.663 --> 19:25.664
- YOU HAVE A SNAKE?

19:25.747 --> 19:28.166
- NOT ON ME.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.126
- JAMES!

19:29.209 --> 19:30.294
- I HAD A SNAKE,

19:30.377 --> 19:31.461
AND IT KIND OF GOT AWAY.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.755
- A SNAKE GOT AWAY
IN OUR HOUSE?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.091
- FIND HIM, SQUEEZY.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.302
- BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.845
- I CAN'T FIND MY MOUSE!

19:39.928 --> 19:41.346
- I DO NOW.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.766
- DOES HE KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT CHEDDAR?

19:44.850 --> 19:45.392
- LET ME GET YOU SOME MILK
AND COOKIES.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.402
- ARE YOU ASLEEP?

19:55.485 --> 19:56.445
- NO.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.654
ARE YOU?

19:57.738 --> 19:58.780
- HOW CAN I BE ASLEEP

19:58.864 --> 19:59.698
IF I JUST ASKED
IF YOU'RE ASLEEP?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.867
- I'M SORRY.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.994
I'M A LITTLE ON EDGE.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.413
WHO CAN SLEEP WITH THAT CREATURE

20:06.496 --> 20:07.789
CREEPING AROUND THE HOUSE?

20:07.873 --> 20:10.459
- I KNOW.
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.251
[gasps] WHAT WAS THAT?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.295
SOMETHING TOUCHED MY FOOT.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.630
- THAT WAS MY FOOT.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.132
- KEEP THAT SCALY THING OVER
ON YOUR SIDE!

20:18.550 --> 20:20.469
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SNAKE.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.803
- SNAKE?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.221
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT MOUSE.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.058
- WHO CARES ABOUT A SNAKE
OR A MOUSE

20:26.141 --> 20:28.936
WHEN THERE ARE ZOMBIE BUNNIES?
