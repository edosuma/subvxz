WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE KIDS.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.500
BUT MADDIE LEFT ME
IN CHARGE HERE.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.900
I CAN'T LEAVE LITTLE PEOPLES
IN CHARGE OF LITTLER PEOPLES.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.567
WE CAN HANDLE IT.
THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP.

JUST STAND THERE.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.867
DO SOMETHING.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.900
YOU ARE NOT MY MOMMY.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.734

11:23.734 --> 11:25.700
WANT MY MOMMY!

11:25.700 --> 11:29.133

11:31.867 --> 11:33.834
I WANNA PLAY HORSEY.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.767
OK.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.467

11:47.834 --> 11:49.033
YOU WANNA GIVE ME A TIP?

11:49.033 --> 11:51.033
SURE. YOU SHOULD
DO SOMETHING

11:51.033 --> 11:53.033
ABOUT YOUR
DISPROPORTIONATE HEAD.

11:53.033 --> 11:55.200
IT WAS A BAD HAIRCUT.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.000
I WANNA PLAY IN THE HOTEL.
HOW ABOUT SLIDING DOWN
THE AIR DUCTS?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.600
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.300
I WANNA PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.700
OK. YOU HIDE. WE'LL COUNT.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.600

12:33.500 --> 12:36.200
YEAH. I ONLY DID THIS
TO IMPRESS MADDIE.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.567
BUT I DON'T THINK
LOSING THE KIDS AND GETTING
HER FIRED IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

12:39.567 --> 12:41.700

IN BOTH MY LEGS.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.100
I REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD STOP.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.100
I WON'T LET YOU STOP.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.100
JUST LIKE
WHEN YOU WOULDN'T LET ME STOP
WHEN YOU TAUGHT ME THE ALPHABET.
