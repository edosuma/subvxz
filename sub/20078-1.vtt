01:10.360 --> 01:12.272
Ah, shit.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.350
Hey, Ann. I gotta go to work.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.193
Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.
Leave me a message.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.556
Hey, hon. I was hoping to catch you.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.633
It's my big test day, so wish me luck.
Okay, love you.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.235
Ah, fuck! Fuck.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.714
Oh, God. Ah, fuck, mmm, yoga pants.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.110
Let's go!

03:10.440 --> 03:11.760
Chacho, let's go! Let's go!

03:19.280 --> 03:20.430
Suspect's in black Chevy.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.236
We got him.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.550
Whoa!

04:04.480 --> 04:06.756
- Holy shit! What the fuck was that?
- What are you stopping for?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.991
Put your gun on the fucking floor.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.595
It's not my fault. You're the one
driving like a fucking dick.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.831
Oh, so you steady yourself
on the trigger of an M4?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.117
You see those?
Those are the "oh, shit" handles.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.509
That's what they're there for.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.750
Shut up and drive!

04:18.959 --> 04:21.680
Two options. Gun on the floor,
or a muzzle in your mouth.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.957
- Drive!
- There you go!

04:24.120 --> 04:25.156
Open fire!

04:25.680 --> 04:26.670
Son of a whore!

04:26.840 --> 04:28.354
Drive, Chacho! Drive, man!

04:55.200 --> 04:57.112
Let's go!

05:14.040 --> 05:16.396
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

05:16.720 --> 05:19.394
- It's kind of a dick move.
- What?

05:19.560 --> 05:22.234
It's like Santa shot Rudolph
after all the deliveries, you know?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.472
You're a funny motherfucker, Chacho.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.352
That's cold, dude. That's fucking cold, dude.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.720
Let's go, let's go.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.916
You gotta get in the back.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.560
- It's supposed to look like a fare.
- Just go!

05:34.720 --> 05:37.235
Not like a cabbie
with his homie ridin' in the front.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.920
You gotta get in the back.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.514
- Just go.
- Get in the back.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.910
It ain't happenin'.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.275
- No?
- No.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.874
Fuck it.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.713
Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.870
What?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.030
Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.594
Go! Go! Go!

05:55.720 --> 05:57.757
Tel Aviv? What the fuck is Tel Aviv?

05:58.120 --> 05:59.110
Oh.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.190
Chacho.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.113
No, it's Castillo.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.350
Agent Castillo.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.350
I know, It's a bummer, right?

06:08.240 --> 06:09.515
Look at those guys. Whoa!

06:09.720 --> 06:12.633
I took you on vacation
to the Bahamas with my family.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.916
It was great. I loved it.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.595
You fucking piece of shit! To the Atlantis!

06:17.600 --> 06:20.399
Yeah, but in '09, you shot my partner
in a credit union.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.880
His name was Michael Glade.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.077
Hey, keep still.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.950
Easy. Nobody shoot.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.110
Don't move, Chacho!

06:30.560 --> 06:32.279
I'm shot!

06:32.440 --> 06:33.556
Oh, that felt so good!

06:33.720 --> 06:36.155
Oh, shit!

06:36.320 --> 06:38.880
I was praying to God, I was, like,

06:39.080 --> 06:41.151
"Please give me a reason to shoot you."
And you came through, bro!

06:41.320 --> 06:43.630
What's wrong with you? You shot your partner!

06:43.840 --> 06:45.274
Oh, there's one last surprise.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.000
I figured you still owe me,
even after the vacation and everything.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.117
Look at this. Your wife.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.436
Motherfucker!

06:55.120 --> 06:56.236
I'm gonna kill you, Chacho!

06:56.400 --> 06:58.995
I just gave her the attention
you didn't, bro.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.958
You should've cuddled.
You should've cuddled, bro.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.315
Chacho, I'll kill you!

07:24.360 --> 07:25.350
Here we go.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.957
Get at it, girls! Let's go!

07:29.640 --> 07:32.030
Are you cat fighting? Come on, girls!
There you go. There you go.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.759
Shoot, Kyle! Come on!

07:35.920 --> 07:36.956
Baker, what the hell?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.233
It's a grappling exercise!

07:39.400 --> 07:40.595
I'm so sorry. Dude, are you okay?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.194
He hit my bad knee.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.432
I've had some trauma, then I reacted,
and my training took over.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.479
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- What training?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.152
- What goddamn training?
- I don't have any training.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.875
Get off the mat.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.389
Good punch.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.311
None of these aptitude scores

08:20.520 --> 08:24.150
meet even the lowest standards
for graduation.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.710
In fact, most of the disabled cadets

08:26.880 --> 08:29.076
scored much, much higher.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.630
- They did?
- Yeah, even in marksmanship.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.393
Well, I don't doubt that.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.313
Disabled folks are doing a ton these days.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.676
Look at that Olympic runner with no legs.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.116
He killed his girlfriend even.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.280
Not that that's an accomplishment,
but still, it's impressive in its severity.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.716
And then there is your physical.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.310
You've had 23 surgeries?

08:50.480 --> 08:54.472
Yeah, I've had feet, ankles,
knees and shoulders.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.395
And I have a titanium humerus
from here to here. It's pretty cool.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.829
So, how do you feel?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.358
You know, I feel pretty darn good.
I'm on a pharmaceutical regimen.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.835
That helps a lot.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.913
Except for when it rains.
Those days are pretty rough.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.150
Oh, I bet.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.079
I don't think I could live in Seattle.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.434
Jon, why do you wanna be CHP?

09:16.600 --> 09:20.640
Truth be told, my wife wants a separation.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.359
I lost my sponsors about a year ago
and I've been just wallowing.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.196
And she understandably
has lost her attraction to me.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.558
I can feel it when I look at her.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.159
Are you okay? I didn't mean to be a bummer.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.676
It just triggered

09:37.480 --> 09:39.517
- some of my stuff.
- I'm sorry.

09:39.720 --> 09:44.237
I've got some of the same issues
with my husband Ted.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.237
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- It's very painful.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.955
This is Karen. She's a swim instructor.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.720
Whoa! She's very beautiful.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.555
Thank you. He is really good-looking
and he's handsome.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.440
You are a very lucky man.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.990
Thank you. Thank you.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.636
So, how does CHP play into it, Jon?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.110
You know, I learned in couples' therapy

10:09.280 --> 10:12.557
that women often marry their fathers,
and her dad was a cop.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.552
- Ah, I get it.
- Yeah.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.718
Well, you can ride a motorcycle.
I'll give you that.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.917
Yes, ma'am, like a motherfucker.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.516
Okay. I'mma level with you, Jon.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.552
- I like you.
- Thank you.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.712
- You have nice eyes.
- Thank you.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.439
You remind me of my husband.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.716
Thank you.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.997
Tell you what. Today's your lucky day.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.595
I'm gonna graduate you
on a probationary clause,

10:34.760 --> 10:39.516
which means if you are not
in the top 10% of your department

10:39.680 --> 10:43.833
for conduct, safety, and citations,
you're a fucking goner.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.390
- You got me?
- Yes, ma'am, loud and clear.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.199
Don't fuck this up.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.993
Pull to the right.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.114
3-9 to base, we're 7-0-4.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.519
How they gonna force us off the highway,
then block the fucking exit?

11:29.720 --> 11:31.473
LT? Clear?

11:32.160 --> 11:33.514
Hey, hey, hey.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.270
You think that door's gonna evaporate
and not kill that woman right there?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.119
Oh, Dad, what woman?

11:40.520 --> 11:42.079
You're high, right?

11:42.240 --> 11:43.799
It's noon and you're high already.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.758
Lay off, Dad.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.555
No, no, no!

11:47.720 --> 11:49.632
Please, no!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.195
It's gonna be okay, ma'am.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.631
You're gonna be home
with your cats in no time.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.790
Clear!

11:56.960 --> 11:58.394
Oh, shit!

12:09.920 --> 12:13.596
EAGLE-6, we have an 11-80
at the 210 and Lowell.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.753
EAGLE-6 responding to 11-80
at 210 and Lowell.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.831
LT. What's going on?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.754
This ain't the plan.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.910
What are you doin', man?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.231
You and TJ skimmed
200 grand off the last job.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.113
You think I wouldn't notice?

12:45.320 --> 12:48.279
They're on the ramp, TJ. Two bikes.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.829
Dispatch, this is EAGLE-6.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.509
We have four suspects
on two black motorcycles

12:54.680 --> 12:56.990
heading eastbound toward Pennsylvania Ave.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.519
Shots fired, shots fired!

13:01.680 --> 13:03.717
Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.030
- Oh, my God. He's got David.
- Who's David?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.159
One of you is gonna die.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.720
You choose, thief.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.951
Thief? Fuck does that mean?

13:14.120 --> 13:17.636
I let you on my crew,
and you're gonna steal from me?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.029
It's you or David.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.553
TJ!

13:21.720 --> 13:22.710
Hey, TJ!

13:22.880 --> 13:24.234
Buckle back in!

13:24.400 --> 13:25.675
Don't jump, TJ!

13:25.840 --> 13:27.035
Don't jump!

13:27.960 --> 13:29.838
TJ!

13:30.880 --> 13:31.870
TJ!

13:37.240 --> 13:40.711
You've got two weeks to
get our money back, or you die, too.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.639
You understand?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.400
Clay! You're back already, dude?
That's great.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.550
Yeah, let me tell you something.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.270
It's gonna take two surgeries just so I can
lift my children again, you fucking asshole.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.112
Whoa! That's a weird way to thank me for
saving your life, buddy, but you're welcome!

14:27.280 --> 14:28.794
- Shooting me was an act of kindness?
- Absolutely!

14:28.960 --> 14:30.110
You should allow me to return the favor.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.760
But Hector's got your gun.
How are you gonna shoot me?

14:31.920 --> 14:34.037
- Hey! You're a bad partner!
- Yeah? You're incompetent!

14:34.200 --> 14:35.793
- You're a bad person.
- You're not even an agent.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.474
- Bad agent!
- Clay, go home.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.960
You're gonna want to alternate
between heat and ice.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.271
- Twenty minutes each time.
- Shut up. Let's go.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.631
- Get over here.
- Fucker.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.791
CHP Internal has asked for our help
on that armored car job.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.111
They think some of their own were involved.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.312
What, the one where the pilot jumped?

14:52.480 --> 14:56.076
Yeah, or maybe the copilot pushed him.
They don't know.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.469
How many cops do they suspect?

14:57.640 --> 15:00.075
Five. We need to find them.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.230
How much they get?

15:01.440 --> 15:02.794
12.6 million.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.630
Truck had just left Santa Anita with
the cash take from the Breeders' Cup.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.240
You want me to go out there
and ask some questions?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.232
No, I want you to go on the inside.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.675
No shit?

15:11.840 --> 15:13.672
Go undercover within the department?
That's awesome.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.274
Can you ride a bike?

15:15.440 --> 15:16.430
Why a bike?

15:16.640 --> 15:18.279
The bad guys ride bikes. Can you?

15:18.440 --> 15:19.840
Oh, I dominate anything with a motor.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.320
Don't get cocky. I'm serious.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.160
I'm not cocky either.
Give me a snow blower, step the fuck back.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.352
A weed-whipper? I own that shit!

15:28.320 --> 15:30.357
Listen, we need to talk about
you shooting Allen

15:30.520 --> 15:32.591
and the photos of Hector's wife
on your phone.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.194
There's gonna be a panel.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.999
Allen's a pussy. We both know that.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.635
He handed over his weapon to a detainee.
Why don't you review him?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.359
You need to bury it.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.512
Because he's leading the investigation
out in LA.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.875
He's gonna be your point.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.640
Don't send that clown, please.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.191
You think everybody since Glade was a clown.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.033
No, but he is a real clown!

15:50.200 --> 15:51.714
You're acting like a fucking widow.
Get over it.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.190
- Sorry.
- And how do you explain the pictures?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.671
Well, I can't help it if someone
sends me unsolicited photos.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.956
How am I gonna stop that?

15:58.360 --> 15:59.555
So, you had nothing to do with it?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.679
Aside from being handsome
and symmetrical, no.

16:02.840 --> 16:07.198
So, you're not to blame for the cock shots
your phone sent to her phone?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.800
Or did your phone take them
while you were asleep?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.314
Because your dick looked wide awake.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.040
At the time, it seemed like
the more innocent option.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.311
It was less wrong than actually plowing her.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.314
Good! So you didn't have sex with her?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.474
Eventually, I did.
That's why I said, "At the time".

16:21.640 --> 16:25.077
That's the defendant's wife!
The defendant in your case!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.512
I hear you loud and clear, sir.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.239
I really hope you do.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.835
Because I'd hate to lose a great agent
over some bullshit.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.673
I think you're a sex addict.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.354
I understand, sir.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.390
So, who am I playing?

16:37.840 --> 16:39.320
They got you playing, uh...

16:39.480 --> 16:42.359
You're gonna be
Francis Llewellyn Poncherello.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.995
That's a fucked up name.
That's a lot of names.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.595
Well, that's too bad
because we already built the bio.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.035
What are we gonna do, go and change it?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.236
Got it.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.160
Your name is Officer Francis
Llewellyn Poncherello

16:53.360 --> 16:55.716
and you're transferring from CHP in Redding.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.759
Captain Lindel will be the only person
that knows you're FBI.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.593
She put you with a rookie named Jon Baker.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.911
And he won't know shit about shit,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.954
so you'll be able to drag him around
without him getting suspicious.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.714
And stay away from that
hot ass out there in LA.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.789
What's your job?

17:11.960 --> 17:13.280
Find the five dirty cops.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.875
That's right. Blend in.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.550
Hey!

17:21.960 --> 17:23.440
What's up? I'm Jon.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.440
Jon Baker.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.592
Francis, uh, Poncherello.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.877
- Oh, you're Poncherello?
- Yeah.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.554
- Awesome, man. We're partners.
- Oh, cool.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.710
Let's kick this off with the real thing.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.474
Oh, dude!

17:35.640 --> 17:36.960
- Okay.
- Slow down a little bit.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.560
- Sorry.
- That was a bit much.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.915
If you're homophobic or whatever,
that's cool.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.474
No, no, no. What?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.559
I mean, it's not cool to be homophobic,
but I totally respect your right to be.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.554
Wait, you think I'm homophobic
because I won't embrace a man

17:47.720 --> 17:49.712
in his underpants that I just met?
Is that your definition?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.992
But your reaction was really strong.
Borderline violent.

17:53.160 --> 17:58.434
I bet if I were a hot woman in a bikini,
you'd probably be fine hugging me, yeah?

17:59.160 --> 18:03.313
Your question is, "Would I prefer to
hug a hot woman in a bikini

18:03.480 --> 18:05.949
"over a male stranger in his underpants?"

18:06.120 --> 18:08.680
And my answer to that will determine
whether or not I'm a homophobe,

18:08.840 --> 18:10.069
like, according to you?

18:10.520 --> 18:13.115
I think you've oversimplified it, but yes.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.640
- I do.
- Okay.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.360
Here's my answer.
I'm the senior officer here.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.432
You're the rookie that doesn't know
his mouth from his asshole,

18:19.600 --> 18:21.000
let alone the definition of homophobia.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.840
So, from here on out,
you're just gonna shut the fuck up

18:24.040 --> 18:26.600
and wait patiently for me to ask
all the questions. Understood?

18:26.760 --> 18:27.750
I got that.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.679
- Understood?
- I understand.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.638
- I'm sorry.
- Better.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.871
You know, I think I'm a little nervous
'cause it's my first day

18:34.040 --> 18:35.554
- and I have a lot riding on this.
- Don't worry about it.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.830
I'm trying to salvage my marriage...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.559
Did I ask you about your failing marriage?

18:38.760 --> 18:39.750
No.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.355
Just shut up and suit up, okay?

18:42.520 --> 18:43.510
Okay.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.999
No way. Come on, Jon Baker. "The Baker"?

18:48.160 --> 18:49.150
Hey, what's going on, dude?

18:49.320 --> 18:50.549
Brian Grieves.
What the hell are you doing here?

18:50.720 --> 18:51.949
I'm an officer.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.793
That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.553
- What's up, bro?
- Dude, that is awesome!

18:55.720 --> 18:58.235
You know, my cousin competed
against you in freestyle.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.517
I cannot tell you how many times
I've seen you ride.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.670
- Like, a billion.
- Ah!

19:01.880 --> 19:03.872
That's so flattering. Who was your cousin?

19:04.080 --> 19:05.150
Oh, Reed Junior.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.879
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.309
He was amazing.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.675
I wish he would've stuck with it.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.797
Yeah, me too.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.036
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.910
Well, hey, look, man, welcome.
I cannot wait to work with you.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.072
- Oh, man. Do you ride?
- Fuck yeah!

19:18.240 --> 19:19.230
Oh, we're gonna ride!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.153
Awesome. You too, Poncharrow.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.749
Buddy!

19:23.920 --> 19:25.240
- This is gonna be badass!
- It means a lot to me.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.390
Hell, yeah. All right, later.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.080
All right, take care, man.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.753
Do you have a favorite artist?

19:43.360 --> 19:46.432
I have a favorite size. Backpack.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.080
We've just the piece for you.

19:48.760 --> 19:53.596
Piet Mondrian's Composition No. 7, 1941.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.879
20x26 inches.
And if you pay in cash, it's 14.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.190
Million.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.352
- For this?
- Mm-hmm.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.075
Is it finished?

20:03.240 --> 20:06.039
Indeed. You can roll this painting up
and put it in your carry-on.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.635
No matter where you take it
in the world, it's worth 14.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.589
There's no better way to get cash
across the border.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.119
Perfect, I'll take it.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.476
I don't have it, but I'll get you the 14.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.870
Excellent.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.310
Put that away.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.914
You're going to get us
pegged as slap-dicks. Come on.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.480
What's that? No, I got to take notes.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.073
- Hi.
- Good morning.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.309
Okay, everybody.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.314
Uh, we have a couple of new team members
to welcome this morning.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.599
Transferring from the Redding branch
is Officer Pantera.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.156
It's Poncherello. Francis Llewyl Poncherello.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.470
Hi, Francis.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.480
You can call me Ponch. Ponch is fine.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.399
Ponch. Much easier.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.277
And correcting me is, uh, Jon Baker.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.229
Uh, Jon has the distinction of being
the oldest rookie ever.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.750
- Ooh.
- By nine years.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.679
Thank you, thank you.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.359
Oh, I actually have a rookie question,
if you don't mind me interrupting.

21:03.880 --> 21:08.432
Um, I was told that I have to land in the
top 10% of my department in citations...

21:08.800 --> 21:10.792
It's a joke. He was just joking.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.235
Great joke, Jon!

21:12.400 --> 21:13.390
Keep 'em comin'!

21:13.560 --> 21:15.750
Okay, we're having a problem
with the fire extinguishers, people.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.917
Do you each have one in your car?
Show of hands.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.394
Who has a fire extinguisher in their car
at this very moment as we speak?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.880
Gotta say this is pretty badass, yeah?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.759
Being all suited up for battle.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.596
What, looking like UPS drivers?

21:29.760 --> 21:32.320
Yeah, that's super cool.
Fuckin' go brown, right?

21:32.520 --> 21:35.877
We don't look like UPS drivers. Do we?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.599
Hold up a second.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.510
It's Roth.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.909
- You find out where she works?
- On Riverside.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.070
Hey.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.599
Oh, hey! How are you?

21:44.760 --> 21:46.194
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.511
Is that your Sport 1000 I'm seeing?

21:48.680 --> 21:50.911
- Yeah. You know what that is?
- Ah...

21:51.120 --> 21:52.270
Just a little bit.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.511
I got a Paul Smart 1000 myself.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.273
Oh, I love those. Those are beautiful.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.716
So beautiful. I've been looking
for one of yours for a while, though.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.479
- Car wash in the Valley?
- Yeah. Happy Hands.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.393
Okay. Send me the address.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.712
If you're interested, you should ride up
Angeles Crest with us to Newcomb's Ranch.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.270
Beautiful ride, ton of Ducatis.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.670
Um...

22:10.520 --> 22:14.036
God, I'm so flattered
'cause you're crazy attractive,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.112
but I'm trying to repair
my marriage right now.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.714
Oh, my God. Really?

22:17.880 --> 22:18.870
What?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.271
First of all, you're old as fuck.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.717
Second of all, no one wants to hear
about your marriage troubles.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.075
Okay?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.078
So, maybe you just want to
get over yourself a little bit?

22:30.440 --> 22:31.920
- Good work.
- I wasn't...

22:32.200 --> 22:34.920
Good work. No, you're just
blending right in. It's perfect.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.031
I just hope he's not a crazy stalker
or something.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.919
He knew I had cats.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.356
Crazy.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.989
It's probably a lucky guess or something.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.670
Hmm...

22:50.080 --> 22:51.070
Did you hear any names?

22:52.320 --> 22:54.277
LT. What's going on?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.193
Yeah, someone called him "LT."

22:56.360 --> 22:58.829
How about the pilot?
Did he seem to fall, or was he pushed out?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.152
No, I just saw him land.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.353
Don't go back there. No, no, it's fine.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.840
You know what?
Nobody's going to get away with this.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.116
I promise, okay?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.274
Is your friend ticketing me?

23:09.440 --> 23:11.079
- One down.
- Hey!

23:11.280 --> 23:13.920
Jon. What are you doing?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.833
- What am I doing?
- What is this shit?

23:16.040 --> 23:18.316
No, no, no. Hey.
This car doesn't have plates.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.790
No, because it's brand new.
Can you not see it's brand new?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.435
Listen, I've got to write some tickets,
or I'm going to blow my probation

23:23.600 --> 23:24.590
and I'm going to get canned.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.070
But you got to use your brain.
They just bought this car.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.391
We're up! No seatbelt. Red Ford!

23:29.560 --> 23:30.960
We're not up! You're getting ticket-happy!

23:31.120 --> 23:32.190
It's just a seatbelt.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.350
- No!
- Mount up.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.590
No! Stay right here!

23:34.760 --> 23:35.910
Jesus Christ.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.710
Ponch.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.794
Is your partner okay?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.713
He just got assigned to me, you know?

23:47.880 --> 23:50.349
- Right.
- You transfer from Redding?

23:50.520 --> 23:51.954
Yeah! Ponch.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.432
- Ray.
- Nice to meet you.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.475
You must know Bob Lynn?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.950
Of course. Asian Bob. Everybody knows Bob.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.356
- "Asian Bob"?
- Yeah.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.716
Thought he was
English or Scottish or something.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.793
Oh, you're talking about Bob Lynn, L-Y-N-N.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.479
I thought you were talking about
Bob Lin, L-I-N, who's Asian as hell.

24:12.680 --> 24:13.909
I think he's a hundred percent.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.155
But to answer your question, yes.
I do know white Bob.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.640
We haven't met. I'm Gay Terry.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.353
I'm sorry, Irish Gay Terry.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.233
That makes sense, that makes sense.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

24:26.560 --> 24:28.836
Don't do that! Hey!

24:30.120 --> 24:31.349
Okay, this is a prank.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.590
Yeah, I wish it was a prank.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.592
- Buh-bye, Francis!
- You have to be playin'.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.558
Backing up, you don't even look?

24:36.720 --> 24:38.712
Everything's gone to shit,
that's how it's gone.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.349
Hey, I need the address
of the pilot that jumped.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.035
And I also need a profile made for a Bob Lin.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.830
L-I-N for the last name,
and he's got to be super Asian.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.834
- Got it. Bob Lin, super Asian.
- Okay.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.549
Fuck.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.990
You got it, bro?

24:54.400 --> 24:55.390
Huh?

24:55.680 --> 24:56.670
All right.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.072
We're the Highway Patrol.
Shouldn't we be patrolling a highway?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.072
I'm paying my respects
to the widow of a fallen officer.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.839
It's going to take me all of two minutes.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.994
Okay. Listen, I have one shot
at saving my marriage, okay?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.759
This job is crucial to that.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.435
I couldn't care less about your wife,
but stay with the bikes, okay?

25:22.600 --> 25:23.716
And don't ticket anybody.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.111
Okay, and fuck that. Not a chance.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.954
- Excuse me?
- I'm not letting my partner fly solo

25:29.120 --> 25:30.713
into an unknown environment.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.560
You're not going let me or not
let me do a damn thing. You're a rookie!

25:33.760 --> 25:38.797
Okay, I respect your rank, but I am not
letting you enter a domicile while on duty

25:38.960 --> 25:41.316
without me at your six o'clock.
It's a nonstarter, Ponch.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.960
- It's unsafe.
- Christ. Fine!

25:43.600 --> 25:44.920
Just keep your mouth shut.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.070
Okay.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.036
Listen, I do need to warn you, though.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.157
I sometimes get nauseous in people's homes

25:50.360 --> 25:54.593
because of the mix of smells,
the pheromones of food and pets.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.638
You're fuckin' weird, bro.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.157
I don't remember Terrell ever mentioning
a Pueblerro. Is that Native American?

26:00.320 --> 26:01.595
It's Poncherello.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.274
I don't remember that either.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.875
Yeah, I just wanted to stop by
and give my condolences.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.040
Please don't touch anything in the salon.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.230
I was just so shocked.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.034
I mean, I've known TJ for years

26:16.200 --> 26:19.238
and I can't imagine him
jumping out of a helicopter.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.150
Plus, I've always wondered, was TJ
dealing with some kind of depression?

26:25.840 --> 26:28.878
Certainly nothing I knew of.
We were very happy.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.879
Right. Did he owe anybody any money?

26:33.360 --> 26:35.636
Absolutely not.
He left behind a savings account.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.790
No debts.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.919
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.230
Sorry about him.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.200
Uh, was he happy working with Parish?
Did they get along?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.556
You know, I have an appointment
I need to get ready for.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.949
Right. Yeah, me too.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.271
I got to go visit LT.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.360
Who's LT?

27:01.680 --> 27:03.194
Just a mutual friend.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.314
I'm sorry.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.994
- Get outta there. Get outta there, dude!
- Huh?

27:13.160 --> 27:15.117
Get outta there. Jesus.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.471
- I hope you got closure in there.
- Closure?

27:17.640 --> 27:19.040
Yeah, because I almost lost it

27:19.240 --> 27:21.914
when that cat went face-first
into the litter box. Ugh!

27:22.400 --> 27:24.153
What kind of dude uses the word "closure"?

27:24.320 --> 27:25.834
- What, are you a therapist?
- No.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.913
But I've been in couples' therapy for a year.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.635
And that's what it's called when you try
to resolve painful feelings.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.473
- I could tell.
- Isn't that why we're here?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.120
So you could process
the passing of your friend?

27:34.280 --> 27:36.920
Which, by the way,
I am so sorry for your loss, man.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.992
- Oh, my God, dude.
- So sorry. What?

27:39.160 --> 27:40.719
It's just your word choice.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.519
It's like you're three beers too intimate.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.155
You know what... It's the pills.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.993
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.514
- Textbook deflection.
- Oh!

27:49.680 --> 27:51.160
You couldn't be more clichéd if you tried.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.199
"I'm a tough motorcycle cop.
I got no emotions."

27:54.400 --> 27:56.119
- "I don't care who dies."
- Fuck you!

27:56.320 --> 27:58.391
Your buddy's been dead how long?
You still haven't dealt with it?

27:58.560 --> 28:00.153
He's been dead a month, Freud.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.594
- A month?
- Yeah.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.752
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

28:04.920 --> 28:08.118
It's weird that his wife moved on in a month.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.272
In your expertise, she's moved on.
How can you tell?

28:10.440 --> 28:11.999
There's nothing of his in that house.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.677
There's no commendations on the wall,
no pictures of him and his buddies fishing.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.950
There's no tools.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.999
He was a helicopter pilot
without a work bench or a tool box?

28:20.440 --> 28:23.433
And no gun safe?
What cop doesn't have a gun safe?

28:23.600 --> 28:25.478
It's just weird.
Feels like he didn't live there.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.479
Bro, I got to hit the Arby's
at the bottom of the hill. I'm on E.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.160
- Okay?
- Yeah.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.110
Huh?

28:41.480 --> 28:42.709
- Hello?
- Hey, Roth?

28:42.880 --> 28:43.870
Yeah, what's up?

28:44.040 --> 28:46.794
Find out if TJ owned another property,

28:46.960 --> 28:48.952
like a rented or leased.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.389
No problem.

28:53.480 --> 28:54.470
What's going on?

28:54.680 --> 28:55.670
Huh?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.559
Why are you in front of my partner's house?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.359
Oh, just giving my condolences.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.513
- You knew TJ?
- Yup.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.830
The Academy.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.674
Really? What year was that exactly?

29:06.160 --> 29:09.710
Why are you shaking me down, man?
First at lunch and now here?

29:09.880 --> 29:11.109
I mean, I was friends with TJ.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.033
All right? We were friends
and I thought we'd get along too.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.351
But if you're going to be up my ass,
then I'll just keep it movin'.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.710
This is my partner's widow.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.840
I see you around this house again,
I will be in your ass with a boot.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.276
- Yeah, be well, bro.
- Yeah.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.758
Bro, that's quality beef.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.719
Hey, before you go writing
another tire pressure ticket,

29:30.880 --> 29:33.076
tell me what kind of bikes these are.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.396
It's the Ducati Hypermotard. The 939.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.880
It's their all-terrain race bike.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.554
How could you know? You haven't even seen it.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.394
Just listen. You hear that?
It's a big V-twin.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.714
Yeah, but a lot of people make twins.

29:44.880 --> 29:49.193
Yeah, but that one's revving at 9000 RPM
which only a four-valve motor will do.

29:49.360 --> 29:53.070
The only four-valve twin in a supermoto
setup is the Ducati.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.837
They're fast as fuck.

29:58.720 --> 30:03.272
All I wanna do in the middle
of the evening is hold you tight

30:03.600 --> 30:06.911
Rosanna, Rosanna

30:07.320 --> 30:08.720
Hey, Jon. Can I tell you something?

30:10.600 --> 30:14.640
It was pretty impressive the way you
were able to peg those bikes back there.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.996
I think if you would just chill
for five minutes, man,

30:19.160 --> 30:21.629
we can have a winning team.
You know what I mean?

30:21.840 --> 30:23.559
LA-15-7-MARY-3 and 4,

30:23.720 --> 30:26.474
we are in pursuit of red Ferrari.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.074
Code three!

30:28.240 --> 30:30.755
I was trying to give you
a goddamn compliment!

30:37.600 --> 30:39.159
This is 7-MARY-4, we need backup.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.640
All units.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.674
Pull over!

30:47.280 --> 30:50.591
Oh, yeah? Rock beats scissors. Over!

31:01.120 --> 31:02.156
Jon, stop!

31:02.320 --> 31:04.277
- One second.
- Stop! That's an order!

31:04.440 --> 31:06.875
- License and registration.
- What are you doing, boy?

31:07.040 --> 31:08.315
Could you not see what I was holding up?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.870
Okay. Lower the music, please.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.189
"CHP Widows' Fund Gold Donor."
What is this? Are you a widow?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.350
- Hey!
- One second!

31:16.560 --> 31:18.199
- Turn down the music!
- Please turn it down.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.750
If you keep ignoring me, I'm going to
write you up for insubordination.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.115
Do you want to keep this job?

31:22.280 --> 31:25.398
If we don't stop doing your errands
and do some police work,

31:25.560 --> 31:27.313
I'm not going to have a job to lose.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.791
I'm not going to have my day eaten away
by two bickering old ladies.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.476
Shut up, and turn down
the fucking Toto, please.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.560
- Stay in this car.
- Sir!

31:37.720 --> 31:38.710
Stay in this car.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.317
No, I spent $10,000
to the Widows' Fund to get that thing.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.470
Now it's mine!

31:43.640 --> 31:45.711
Get your hands on the car.
Get up against the car!

31:45.920 --> 31:47.070
You want to do this?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.152
- I'll do it.
- Oh, you're in so much trouble.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.470
I'm trained to do it,
and I know how to do it.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.314
You know how dangerous it is
to drive at that speed?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.557
Is this your "get out of jail free" card
in Los Angeles?

31:57.720 --> 31:59.837
Oh, no, it's from the gold donor program,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.559
used to be a guaranteed warning.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.838
We usually just tell them
that the policy ended, and let 'em go.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.673
- Oh.
- We should grab a drink.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.876
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.999
Okay, come with me.
You're going to take a free ride now.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.830
Come with me, sir.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.429
- Thank you.
- I got it.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.195
- Why are you taking him this way?
- There's been a change in policy.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.272
- This is your one freebie.
- Thank you very much.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.033
Hey! What are you doing?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.520
You can't let this obnoxious prick go!

32:22.680 --> 32:23.670
Get in the car.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.069
No, you're getting back in the cop car.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.357
- Let go of him!
- You let go of him!

32:27.520 --> 32:28.715
Dude, he's old as fuck!

32:28.920 --> 32:31.958
I know. He's old, and he's fragile.
Stop fucking jerking on him.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.110
- No, you are!
- Ah!

32:33.280 --> 32:34.350
Get him, Francis!

32:34.520 --> 32:36.398
What the fuck, bitch?

32:36.800 --> 32:39.793
I'm trying to fucking blend in here, man.
I suggest you do the same, okay?

32:39.960 --> 32:43.032
A, you're a coward and a cheap-shot artist.

32:43.960 --> 32:48.318
B, I have to write tickets
and be safe and good conduct!

32:48.480 --> 32:50.631
Stop being a goddamn boy scout!

32:50.800 --> 32:52.712
Get on your bike and go home!

32:53.280 --> 32:55.670
Go home! You're done for the day.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.035
Get outta here.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.199
- This is so hot.
- Mmm.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.594
I like that little brown one.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.194
I would take either.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.994
What are you doing here?

33:15.840 --> 33:16.830
Hey.

33:17.760 --> 33:18.989
Get outta here.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.594
We question the guard from the armored truck.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.556
After you interview Barton, find out
if someone named "LT" works here.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.320
Barton's been MIA since...

33:25.560 --> 33:27.631
Don't tell him shit. Who's "LT"?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.871
He's the shot caller.
I heard it from one of the witnesses.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.030
You're talking to witnesses now?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.954
You're supposed to be undercover,
getting the co-pilot story.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.034
Don't worry about it. We're getting cozy,
and by the way, my new partner's awesome.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.391
Bet you can't wait to shoot him.
You know what?

33:39.560 --> 33:40.914
I'm point, motherfucker!

33:41.120 --> 33:42.156
I'm point.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.750
I'm your boss!

33:43.920 --> 33:45.274
Get outta here.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.155
Officer.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.200
Looks legit to me.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.760
I don't really care what this says.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.230
Hansen just saw him at All Steel Armored.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.720
What about his partner?

34:00.320 --> 34:01.959
There's no way Baker could be IA.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.430
He was a fucking X-Games guy
a few years back.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.158
- You don't like it.
- No, I don't like it.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.154
My son's addicted to heroin.
I got to get him out of this fucking town.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.317
It's the only way
he's ever going to get clean.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.676
Let's just figure out
another way to move the money.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.513
And try to fly with cash?

34:17.679 --> 34:18.875
You kidding me?

34:19.040 --> 34:21.636
The painting's the best way to walk
through customs with $14 million.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.712
- It's beautiful.
- All right, well, then fuck it.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.395
Even if they do show up,
they'll be riding lawnmowers.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.433
Search Bob Lin. L-I-N.

34:28.679 --> 34:29.670
All right.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.429
Oof!

34:33.840 --> 34:35.034
Asian as hell.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.956
Hey.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.474
Hi, what's up?

34:51.639 --> 34:52.994
I'm right in the middle
of giving a swim lesson.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.150
Oh, sorry.

34:55.000 --> 34:55.989
What are you wearing?

34:57.480 --> 34:58.550
Oh, it's my uniform.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.075
From the CHP.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.397
Aren't you supposed to change
out of it after you get off work?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.120
Yeah, you can. Most guys probably...

35:06.280 --> 35:09.990
It was my first day, so I thought you'd
probably want to see what I look like.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.230
In all brown?

35:12.960 --> 35:13.950
It's great, Jon.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.870
Um... I thought maybe it would
remind you of your dad.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.598
Oh, while I have you,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.834
you used the patio last night
to cut through to the guest house.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.595
Let's stick to the agreements, okay?
Use the side entrance.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.955
Can you do that?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.953
Yeah. Sorry about that.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.150
Hey, Jon!

35:36.600 --> 35:37.590
Hey, Rick.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.673
You working down at UPS now?

35:39.840 --> 35:43.629
No, man, I'm a police officer.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.035
Hell, yeah.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.311
Hey, uh, can we get a to-go box?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.472
It's for your shirt, bro,
so you can eat it later.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.515
- Classic Ponch-y.
- Yeah.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.796
Always deflecting!

36:12.960 --> 36:14.599
Oh, deflecting.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.910
Why don't you stop using that word?

36:16.080 --> 36:17.196
Do you even know what the word means?

36:17.400 --> 36:18.595
- Yeah.
- Because I got a great example for you.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.876
Okay, give me an example.

36:20.040 --> 36:24.239
It's when a guy is super embarrassed about
taking his third dump before 11:00 a.m.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.232
So he makes fun of his partner's shirt.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.390
Deflecting.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.597
Okay, why are you counting
how many times I go to the bathroom?

36:29.760 --> 36:31.319
- Hard to miss, man.
- It's really pervy, man.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.510
- Oh, it's pervy?
- Yeah.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.799
We're on and off these bikes every half
an hour, so you can go in there and unload.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.400
- Drop it.
- Admit it.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.354
You have something going on intestinally

36:40.520 --> 36:45.390
and you're too proud to stop
at a Walgreen's or a CVS to deal with it.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.200
Is it a chronic thing, or did you eat
something dicey last night?

36:48.360 --> 36:49.350
Just drop it!

36:49.560 --> 36:52.029
Listen, okay... Don't pull away.
I'm worried about you.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.520
Is there any blood?

36:53.680 --> 36:56.070
Fucking blood. Unbelievable.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.553
We're going to talk about this.

37:04.280 --> 37:09.514
Dude, I will run in and get you
some Imodium if you're ashamed, okay?

37:09.680 --> 37:13.117
Take the olive branch
and accept some help, okay?

37:13.320 --> 37:14.640
Come on, Ponch!

37:16.000 --> 37:17.798
Ponch, slow down.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.071
You're not good enough to ride this fast.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.357
I'd rather crash and die than talk to you.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.399
You clearly have a health issue,
like Crohn's or colitis.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.155
I won't bring it up again.
Just, please, slow down.

37:28.320 --> 37:32.277
I don't have colitis, and there's other
goddamn reasons for going to the bathroom!

37:32.440 --> 37:33.920
Yeah, but for 20 minutes?

37:34.080 --> 37:37.551
Even a prostate thing would be like, uh...

37:38.920 --> 37:40.912
Oh, my God!

37:42.200 --> 37:47.275
Are you stroking yourself three times
a day in communal bathrooms?

37:47.440 --> 37:48.954
Drop it! That's an order!

37:49.160 --> 37:50.753
You're going to crash.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.117
Code Four! We are a Code Four!

38:03.280 --> 38:05.636
Kiddo. Mask up.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.514
Clear!

38:22.800 --> 38:23.870
He's got a gun!

38:25.760 --> 38:26.955
Fuck!

38:27.640 --> 38:30.519
God damn it! Where'd they come from?

38:35.800 --> 38:36.836
Let's go, let's go!

38:41.240 --> 38:43.471
Look, I'm sorry you crashed, man.
I tried to warn you.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.676
I don't wanna talk about it.

38:44.880 --> 38:45.916
Okay.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.914
Look, man, just, real quick,
I wasn't trying to embarrass you.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.959
We all have sex issues.
I haven't slept with my wife in a year.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.680
But when people have
oversexualized behavior like yours,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.752
sometimes that's evidence
of past childhood trauma

38:57.920 --> 38:59.798
and I just wanted you
to feel safe talking to me.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.679
There's been no trauma, okay?

39:01.840 --> 39:05.117
And my goal in life isn't to feel safe
talking to you.

39:05.640 --> 39:09.639
What I do and how many times I do it
in the bathroom, that's personal, okay?

39:09.800 --> 39:12.759
That's my business. That's not our business.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.673
- I'll stay out of it.
- Okay, good.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.240
But, if something did happen...

39:16.400 --> 39:18.710
I just want you to hear me.
It's not your fault.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.360
- Nothing happened, bro.
- It's not your fault.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.510
Nothing happened.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.672
- Are you positive?
- I'm positive.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.951
If anything,
you should worry about your shit.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.110
- My shit?
- Yeah.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.270
Oh, what's my shit, Ponch?

39:28.440 --> 39:32.317
Well, Jon, if you haven't been
fucking your wife in over a year,

39:32.480 --> 39:33.675
then somebody else has.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.793
It's not even a question of "if,"
it's a question of "who."

39:35.960 --> 39:37.314
Who's been fucking your wife?

39:38.160 --> 39:40.152
LA-15 to all units. 211.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.119
Eastbound 101 on-ramp at Cahuenga.
Armed suspects fleeing on motorcycles.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.555
Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.870
It's three exits over. Come on, let's go!

39:46.800 --> 39:48.757
I'm sorry, come on! Help me with the bike!

39:52.360 --> 39:53.350
God damn it.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.754
Jesus Christ!

40:39.720 --> 40:41.677
All right, go around me. You won't make it.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.160
Bullshit! I can ride.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.358
You crashed eight minutes ago
on flat pavement.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.119
Jon and Ponch, what's your 20?

40:52.280 --> 40:55.512
I'm northbound, through Elysian Park.

40:56.680 --> 40:57.796
Whoa, whoa...

40:58.000 --> 40:59.798
Ponch is southbound.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.676
Change of plans. I'm going around.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.030
This is 7-MARY-4,
we're heading towards some kind of fair.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.392
7-MARY-4, we're right behind you.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.711
I'd just moved the stuffed animals
closer to the dunk tank,

41:13.880 --> 41:16.190
but other than that,
everything looks spectacular.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.716
What the fuck?

41:18.880 --> 41:20.234
Ah!

41:26.880 --> 41:28.314
Ah! Ow!

41:28.760 --> 41:29.750
Oh!

41:35.160 --> 41:36.150
Oh, God.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.995
Freeze! Get on the ground!

41:38.160 --> 41:39.150
Cool it!

41:39.320 --> 41:41.039
God damn it! Please!

41:41.760 --> 41:42.910
Go! Go! Go!

41:47.040 --> 41:48.269
Call 911!

41:48.480 --> 41:50.551
Who are they gonna call? Different cops?

41:50.720 --> 41:52.393
They're heading south on Stadium Way.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.392
I'm on Stadium Way.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.072
Where are you guys?

41:59.360 --> 42:00.350
Stop!

42:00.920 --> 42:01.910
I said "Stop"!

42:02.120 --> 42:03.474
Stop, motherfuckers!

42:03.640 --> 42:04.869
Great job!

42:05.080 --> 42:06.912
I'm not gonna empty my weapon without cause.

42:07.080 --> 42:10.960
If this was a public bathroom, you'd be
shootin' your weapon all over the place.

42:11.360 --> 42:15.115
EAGLE-6, the suspects are
on Stadium Way, approaching Riverside.

42:19.320 --> 42:21.516
Come on, you piece of shit!

42:21.720 --> 42:24.440
- What's happening?
- These bikes'll never catch those.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.916
They're just walking away. Come on!

42:27.080 --> 42:28.912
Those bikes must be going 150.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.116
We're maxed at 130.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.478
7-MARY-3 to EAGLE-6, what is your status?

42:35.440 --> 42:36.954
EAGLE-6!

42:37.120 --> 42:39.237
Wake up! What is your status?

42:39.400 --> 42:41.517
7-MARY-3, shut the fuck up.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.434
I don't see 'em.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.592
- You got 'em?
- Negative.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.397
Shit, where'd they go? Jon, you got eyes?

42:57.560 --> 42:58.596
No.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.637
- Dude, do you see them?
- No.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.559
Yeah, well done, EAGLE-6.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.514
Yeah, fantastic.

43:18.920 --> 43:19.956
Ponch!

43:20.120 --> 43:21.520
Ah!

43:28.880 --> 43:30.200
Holy shit!

43:30.360 --> 43:31.999
That was fucking close.

43:32.600 --> 43:33.716
Hey...

43:34.200 --> 43:35.520
Dude, I just want...

43:37.480 --> 43:39.278
That's for kicking my knee.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.031
Fucking hurt my feelings.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.069
Fuck.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.711
Hey, it's Jon. Leave me a message.

44:44.920 --> 44:48.675
Hey, Jon. I said I'm sorry, man.
Stop declining my calls.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.360
All right, call me back, bud.

44:50.520 --> 44:51.510
All right, y'all.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.831
Gonna feel like
we living in Seattle tomorrow morning

44:54.040 --> 44:56.635
as rains are expected
throughout the Southland.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.200
Mmm.

45:02.960 --> 45:03.950
Mmm.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.830
Ooh.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.270
Fuck.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.036
Oh, fuck.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.630
Oh...

45:23.400 --> 45:24.470
Fucking rain.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.597
Shit.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.473
Karen! Sweetheart!

45:31.640 --> 45:34.235
Karen!

45:34.400 --> 45:35.834
Karen!

45:36.640 --> 45:39.314
Karen, can you come in here
and bring me my pills?

45:39.480 --> 45:40.960
Is that Jon?

45:41.280 --> 45:42.475
Probably.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.154
Karen, can you help me?

45:44.320 --> 45:45.913
Should we help him?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.037
This is how he gets attention.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.395
So, no.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.196
Give me that mustache.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.596
Mmm.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.314
Shit.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.951
Oh... Oh, oh...

46:11.200 --> 46:13.112
Oh. Mmm.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.158
Mmm, okay. Okay.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.159
Okay. Okay.

46:21.720 --> 46:22.790
Phone!

46:23.640 --> 46:25.472
Okay, okay.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.869
Okay.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.914
My guy at the Bureau
says there's a panel on him

46:30.120 --> 46:32.954
and his name is Castillo, not Poncherello.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.360
- Oh, shit, Baker's calling me.
- Ignore it.

46:36.640 --> 46:37.915
Yeah, dispatch.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.870
Mmm.

46:40.040 --> 46:43.875
Good morning. Uh, it's Officer Jon Baker,

46:44.040 --> 46:46.794
and I was wondering if you could patch
me through to Ava Perez.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.270
It's an emergency.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.314
So, let me get this straight.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.949
You thought it was inappropriate
to go on a motorcycle ride together

46:54.160 --> 46:56.391
and now, I'm supposed to
come over to your bedroom,

46:56.560 --> 46:58.836
help you from your bed into your bathtub

46:59.040 --> 47:01.077
so you can pop some pills and loosen up?

47:01.240 --> 47:02.230
Yes, ma'am.

47:02.440 --> 47:04.909
And I'm guessing you're undressed.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.830
I am not dressed. That is correct.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.310
What do you think? 10, 15 minutes, maybe?

47:11.480 --> 47:13.119
I will not be right over.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.714
All right, have a good one.

47:14.880 --> 47:15.950
Ava?

47:20.440 --> 47:22.955
There was no record of an "LT"
working at All Steel,

47:23.120 --> 47:25.715
but I did get a hit on that
property search for TJ.

47:25.960 --> 47:29.192
Turns out they filed an eviction notice
yesterday for an apartment he cosigned on.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.715
Oh, nice.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.678
Text me the address.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.279
Buddy.

47:37.440 --> 47:40.160
Oh, my God, dude. I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.352
I thought I was gonna have to call 911
or something.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.591
Don't worry about it. Do you need water?
What do you need?

47:44.760 --> 47:48.117
I don't need any water,
but I gotta get into that bathtub soon.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.600
If you could carry me over there.

47:49.800 --> 47:50.836
Excuse me, what did you say?

47:51.200 --> 47:55.115
I need to get into some warm water or
I'm gonna be stuck on this floor all day.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.316
So, carry me over there
and pop me in the tub.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.596
Yeah, I can't do that.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.796
What do you mean, you can't do that?

47:58.960 --> 48:00.235
Physically, I can do that.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.313
But I'm not gonna carry your naked ass
into the tub. You got a curtain on, bro.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.637
Are you kidding me?
I saved your life yesterday.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.200
Oh, my God!
I knew you were gonna bring that up!

48:07.400 --> 48:08.595
Of course I brought it up!

48:08.760 --> 48:10.558
I saved your life, you won't even carry me!

48:10.720 --> 48:11.710
I'll do anything else!

48:11.880 --> 48:13.792
I'll clean this fucking pigsty,
but I'm not gonna carry you.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.469
You wouldn't be standing here!
You can't lift me and take me to the tub?

48:16.640 --> 48:19.712
You know what? I'll drag you there, but
I'm not gonna cradle you like a newborn.

48:19.880 --> 48:20.950
I'm not gonna do that.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.560
- You're gonna drag me there?
- Yeah.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.440
Once you drag me there, you have
to lift me up into the tub anyway.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.956
- So just grab me and get it over with.
- Fine!

48:28.120 --> 48:29.315
You're such a homophobe.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.470
Stop calling me that!

48:30.640 --> 48:32.199
- You won't even look at me!
- You'd have to be gay

48:32.360 --> 48:33.555
for me to be homophobic towards you!

48:34.360 --> 48:37.000
You're using it incorrectly
and irresponsibly.

48:37.640 --> 48:38.630
Argh! Ow!

48:38.800 --> 48:40.359
God, you're fucking hurting me, man.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.119
- Let's just get it over with!
- You're making it worse!

48:42.280 --> 48:43.760
I'm not gonna argue semantics with you.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.594
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, dude!

48:45.760 --> 48:48.559
- Oh, no!
- Grab the curtain! Go!

48:48.720 --> 48:49.836
I'm trying! I can't feel floor!

48:58.080 --> 48:59.116
Oh, God.

48:59.960 --> 49:01.838
Oh, my God. Dude.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.474
Oh, man.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.074
I'm sorry, bro!

49:05.240 --> 49:07.277
Did you break anything? You okay?

49:07.440 --> 49:08.590
No, I don't think so.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.796
Okay.

49:10.360 --> 49:11.840
Oh, my gosh!

49:14.000 --> 49:15.480
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

49:17.040 --> 49:19.874
Did I feel you face-plant
into my pubic mound?

49:20.040 --> 49:22.555
No! There was no contact whatsoever.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.555
Are you sure? Because I could've sworn
I felt either your nose or your lips?

49:26.720 --> 49:28.473
Nothing touched, bro. Nothing touched.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.154
Oh...

49:34.880 --> 49:37.600
There might have been
a little bit of contact.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.992
I fucking knew it! I felt it!

49:45.520 --> 49:47.591
You face-planted my bag!

49:49.240 --> 49:50.435
I think this is God's way of
getting back to me

49:50.600 --> 49:52.876
for all the shit that I said
about your wife yesterday.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.316
That was really shitty of me, man. I'm sorry.

49:55.480 --> 49:56.800
It's all right.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.600
Yeah, but still, if someone would have
said that shit to me,

49:59.760 --> 50:02.355
I wouldn't have risked my life to
save theirs 10 minutes later.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.040
I mean, it's pretty unbelievable.

50:07.320 --> 50:09.880
You know you're the second person
to save my life?

50:10.400 --> 50:11.754
Yeah? Who was the first?

50:11.920 --> 50:13.559
My ex-partner.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.800
Agent Glade.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.675
Agent Glade?

50:17.840 --> 50:19.320
What do you mean, Agent Glade?

50:21.440 --> 50:22.430
I'm FBI.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.231
- You're FBI?
- Yup.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.072
Are you working the armored car jobs?

50:28.240 --> 50:30.596
Oh, I'm not working them. We're working them.

50:30.760 --> 50:33.719
Oh, you were right about that
helicopter pilot that jumped.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.910
He had a second home.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.400
There's no way he could afford it
on a cop's salary.

50:36.560 --> 50:37.550
He had to have been dirty.

50:37.760 --> 50:38.989
We gotta go check it out.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.072
You get in this tub with me right now.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.520
I'm gonna wash you from head to toe, Ponch-y.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.035
- You need help?
- Huh?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.316
- Help?
- No, I got it.

50:48.520 --> 50:50.591
- You sure?
- Yup.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.155
Oh, shit!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.313
Okay. I'm good.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.312
- Oh, God!
- Sorry.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.073
- Come on!
- Okay.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.797
They moved all this stuff in on a Sunday,

51:02.960 --> 51:04.440
but I don't think they
actually ever slept here.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.354
They? Another woman?

51:07.520 --> 51:10.035
No, it was a man. His partner.

51:10.200 --> 51:11.429
You know.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.353
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm-hmm. We dig.

51:13.520 --> 51:14.510
Where's the workbench?

51:14.680 --> 51:16.637
- Is there a garage?
- Yeah. I'll show you.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.994
Five dollars says there's a workbench.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.150
Five dollars.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.960
Gun safe. Workbench.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.395
Five dollars.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.040
Was his boyfriend on the lease?

51:36.280 --> 51:37.270
Uh, yeah.

51:37.440 --> 51:38.920
Barton. David Barton.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.520
Oh, shit!

51:41.280 --> 51:42.600
Who's David Barton?

51:43.800 --> 51:47.316
That was the guard that was being held at
gunpoint when TJ jumped, who's now MIA.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.755
That's brutal.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.594
His boyfriend was being
held hostage by chance?

51:51.760 --> 51:53.956
Not by chance. No way.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.713
I'm sure they were all working together.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.877
So they must have fucked over LT.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.554
We need round two with TJ's wife.

51:59.760 --> 52:00.796
See ya, buddy.

52:02.080 --> 52:05.073
Jesus, dude, you eat more pills than Elvis.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.716
Mmm.

52:10.400 --> 52:13.040
Hey, I know you were joking back there,

52:13.200 --> 52:16.318
but I want you to know
I don't abuse my medication.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.880
Oh, I wasn't joking.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.678
How often do you shit?

52:20.840 --> 52:22.479
- How often do I shit?
- Yeah.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.519
The normal amount.
Like every two or three weeks.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.194
- That's a problem.
- What?

52:27.360 --> 52:29.875
That is a problem.
That's the first sign of opiate addiction.

52:30.640 --> 52:31.869
Why would I wanna shit more often?

52:32.080 --> 52:35.278
I mean,
shitting is a total waste of man's time.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.954
But it's not. Shitting is so good.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.679
It's man's last refuge.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.713
I'm busy. Please, don't come back.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.553
No, no, no, Miss Jackson.

52:45.280 --> 52:48.557
We just want justice for TJ.
Don't you want that?

52:51.120 --> 52:53.271
So, you were just trying
to keep TJ's pension?

52:53.480 --> 52:56.951
Somebody knew about TJ and Barton,
and they were using that against him.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.873
We'll need your help
to see who that could be.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.596
I see you around this house again,
I will be in your ass

53:01.760 --> 53:02.955
with a boot.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.432
- Motherfucker!
- What are you doing?

53:05.600 --> 53:07.239
I told you to stay away from here!

53:07.400 --> 53:09.278
Ponch!

53:12.400 --> 53:13.754
Ah!

53:17.440 --> 53:19.033
My cats! My babies!

53:20.080 --> 53:22.072
Get out, now!

53:26.080 --> 53:27.150
Oh, God!

53:28.040 --> 53:30.191
Not the vases! No, no, no!

53:30.360 --> 53:31.350
You little shit!

53:32.320 --> 53:34.232
Get over here, you punk bitch!

53:38.040 --> 53:39.952
- Jon!
- What are you doing?

53:40.120 --> 53:41.634
No, no, no. Put it back!

53:45.800 --> 53:46.790
He's out!

53:49.720 --> 53:50.790
What the hell?

53:53.040 --> 53:54.315
Oh, oh.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.915
I am so sorry.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.232
Uh, we had no choice.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.991
Except maybe that last one.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.799
That was a little excessive.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.640
Do you have a vacuum?

54:06.480 --> 54:07.800
All right. We're on the same team, man.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.474
Let's stop kicking each other's asses.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.240
I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with
my dead partner's widow.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.153
Who all knew about TJ and Barton?

54:14.320 --> 54:17.674
Listen, I didn't know about that shit until
just now and we were partners eight years.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.672
The guy pointing the gun at Barton
damn well knew.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.833
- Was he friends with an "LT"?
- Which one?

54:23.000 --> 54:23.990
There was more than one?

54:24.160 --> 54:25.958
There's more than one "LT"?

54:26.120 --> 54:28.919
You mean "lieutenant,"
or someone actually named "LT"?

54:31.120 --> 54:33.760
LT. Lieutenant.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.952
It was right there the whole time.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.480
Those are all the active
lieutenants at Central.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.630
Okay.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.473
Geek. Weirdo.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.836
Woman. No. Woman. No.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.036
Nerd.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.999
Oh-oh! Of course! Ray Kurtz!

54:48.160 --> 54:49.674
Look at this psycho. Come on.

54:49.840 --> 54:51.354
- Not a good guy, right?
- Not a good guy.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.955
Never sent a Mother's Day card,
fucking hates koala bears.

54:54.120 --> 54:56.351
- Boom! That's our guy.
- That's the guy!

54:56.560 --> 54:57.960
I should go get us some new bikes.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.713
Fast ones like theirs.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.394
You're gonna get us new bikes?

55:01.560 --> 55:04.632
Not me personally. I can't afford them,
but you got that fed money, right?

55:04.800 --> 55:06.393
I do have that fed money.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.474
Yeah.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.395
Come on!

55:14.600 --> 55:15.716
Perfecto, perfecto.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.076
- Look at those!
- Let's get out of here, man.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.709
Huh? No, you gotta see the suits!
I got us suits.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.070
- Suits?
- You're gonna love this.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.754
- What were you guys saying?
- Huh?

55:35.920 --> 55:36.910
What were you guys saying?

55:37.080 --> 55:39.151
Uh, they just said they liked the bikes.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.875
Oh, you guys built them, so, cool.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.240
Are you guys talking shit on me?

55:54.400 --> 55:55.550
- What are they saying?
- No...

55:55.720 --> 55:57.393
I feel like, he was pointing at my dick

55:57.560 --> 56:00.439
and I heard "pequeño." I think is "tiny,"
right? Or small, or something?

56:00.640 --> 56:04.714
Oh, no, he said that you look so buff
that you make the bikes look tiny.

56:04.920 --> 56:05.910
Strong man!

56:06.120 --> 56:08.680
But then he pointed at my crotch.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.280
Because that's where the bikes go.

56:10.560 --> 56:11.835
Oh...

56:12.280 --> 56:14.431
Of course, man! Well, thank you, dude.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.710
You're pretty ripped, too.

56:19.600 --> 56:23.037
- What'd he say?
- He said, "You know what? Ride safe."

56:23.240 --> 56:24.913
Oh, cool, man. Thank you.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.196
All right. Let's do it.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.199
Man, I really like those guys.
We should get a beer with them.

56:29.400 --> 56:31.869
Yeah, totally, man!
I'm sure they would love it!

56:32.040 --> 56:33.599
Why are they on those?

56:33.760 --> 56:35.319
And why aren't they wearing shit brown?

56:35.520 --> 56:36.510
Yeah.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.591
Watch this.
I'm gonna make him give up his whole crew.

56:41.520 --> 56:42.954
Wow!

56:43.160 --> 56:44.310
We heard this was your spot.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.040
Man, what is that? Four, four-fifty?

56:47.200 --> 56:49.999
That's "World's Strongest Man" shit.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.480
I think it's 350.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.237
You guys kinda caught me in the middle of it.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.234
Why don't you come back in
an hour and a half or so, when I'm gone?

56:57.400 --> 56:59.357
No, right now is good. We'll just shadow you.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.199
Are you gonna lift this?
You're gonna lift this.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.315
Whoa!

57:05.920 --> 57:09.118
Hey, how did you know about TJ?
His wife didn't even know.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.596
I can't imagine anyone
trusting you with a secret.

57:11.760 --> 57:12.796
Not like that.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.553
Unless they were part of your crew.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.872
I can't imagine anyone trusting you
with their life. Oh...

57:19.200 --> 57:20.190
Wait, your partner.

57:20.360 --> 57:23.080
He did just before he got gunned down
in front of you.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.751
Oh, so, you know something about me.
I know something about you.

57:27.960 --> 57:32.955
In 24 years with the CHP, LT,
you shot and killed five suspects.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.316
- Great job. Very thorough.
- Very thorough.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.914
- You know what confuses me?
- Hmm?

57:39.360 --> 57:42.671
That you have an Italian name, Poncherello.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.870
Mm-hmm?

57:44.120 --> 57:46.954
Why didn't they give you a Guatemalan name

57:47.120 --> 57:49.157
or Taiwanese, or whatever the fuck you are?

57:49.400 --> 57:51.676
Yeah, and you know what's confusing to me?

57:51.840 --> 57:55.629
That in your file, there's no mention
of you killing TJ, Brill, or Stevens.

57:56.200 --> 57:58.476
But I can put it in there
because I don't mind paperwork.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.711
- He doesn't. He loves paperwork.
- I don't really care.

58:01.360 --> 58:04.558
You think I'm Haitian or Cuban, from Miami?

58:05.280 --> 58:08.478
I'm law, motherfucker, the old kind.

58:08.640 --> 58:11.360
If you had something on me,
we'd be in the box right now,

58:11.520 --> 58:13.671
but you got nothin'!

58:14.040 --> 58:17.917
So, why don't you fuck off
and get a motorcycle lesson?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.719
God damn it.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.036
- What?
- Shit!

58:24.200 --> 58:27.079
- You were great back there.
- No, I wasn't.

58:27.240 --> 58:30.551
I loved that part when you were like, uh,
"I don't mind doing paperwork."

58:30.720 --> 58:33.440
- Now you're making fun of me. Shut up!
- That was tight. Seriously.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.910
You couldn't have known
he was going to go all silverback.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.400
That was impressive.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.358
- Shut up, man.
- He got scary.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.636
No, he's not that fucking cool.

58:40.800 --> 58:42.792
That guy's pretty fucking punk rock,
that guy. I kinda like him.

58:42.960 --> 58:44.360
Dude, no. He's not that fucking cool.

58:44.520 --> 58:46.000
He was bench-pressing 450 pounds!

58:46.160 --> 58:48.959
- Oh, my God! That was 350 pounds!
- No way!

58:49.120 --> 58:51.680
Would you stop? Would you table it?
He's not gonna talk, okay?

58:51.880 --> 58:53.200
That's the main point.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.158
We gotta get one of his crew that will.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.595
We need to fucking focus right now...

59:00.760 --> 59:01.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.280
- Hey. Excuse me?
- What?

59:03.440 --> 59:04.430
Are you kidding me right now?

59:04.640 --> 59:05.630
What's the problem?

59:05.800 --> 59:09.350
You just said we have to focus,
and you're already bird-dogging ass?

59:09.560 --> 59:10.960
Ponch, this is a problem.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.190
I'm sorry, man.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.676
I'm kinda powerless
when it comes to yoga pants.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.479
- Okay.
- Can you do me a favor?

59:16.640 --> 59:17.630
Yeah.

59:17.800 --> 59:20.520
Is there double-stitching on the side
with a banana grundle?

59:20.680 --> 59:22.353
A banana grundle? What's a banana grundle?

59:22.520 --> 59:24.318
It's the fucking gusset, bro.
It's the gusset.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.314
Okay, I'll look.
I don't know these things, all right?

59:28.680 --> 59:31.070
Yeah, I guess. Banana grundle.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.233
Oh, my God. They're Lululemons.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.673
What? Lululemons?

59:35.920 --> 59:37.240
What are Lululemons?

59:37.400 --> 59:39.312
It's like wrapping on a woman's body,
dude, that's what it is.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.312
- Here they come.
- Act cool.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.153
- Hey!
- Hey, superheroes.

59:43.320 --> 59:45.198
- Hey.
- Hey, are you okay?

59:45.360 --> 59:46.589
Do you need to find a toilet?

59:47.320 --> 59:48.310
- Okay.
- I think so.

59:48.520 --> 59:50.034
- You think you can ride with that?
- I don't know.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.920
Let's you get out of this parking lot.
You have a visible erection. Let's go.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.875
Oh, Dad.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.000
Can you just close it?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.200
Come on, get up. Get up, get up.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.113
Come on, get up.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.400
Can't spend all day and night
in bed in the dark.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.678
You oughta go to a gym or something,
and get your endorphins pumping.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.190
Yes, sir.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.920
Come on. You gotta stay healthy for one week.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.353
One week, stay outta trouble.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.439
We'll be surfing, drinking Mai Tais.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.710
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.439
I'm gonna do it.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.559
Yeah, there's no point in me doing this
without you, you know?

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.950
I love you, kiddo.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.395
I love you.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.434
Oh, shit.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.554
AMEX just called to verify
a $48,000 charge. What the fuck?

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.394
We needed new gear and new bikes.
It's totally legit.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.394
Legit? You gotta put in
for that kind of money!

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.755
Are you crazy?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.400
It just seemed time-sensitive.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.550
Seemed?

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.639
You got a break,
or were you actively in pursuit?

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.996
A break? No, we have the guy.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.389
Ray Kurtz, he's our man.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.636
Is he in custody?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.000
Uh, we don't have anything
super concrete yet.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.355
Are you joking?

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.274
Allen's got a legitimate lead,
and it didn't cost him a goddamn penny!

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.430
What?

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.512
He's walking around like
he's some goddamn genius!

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.670
Allen doesn't have shit.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.594
He found out there were
marked bills in that 12.6

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.831
and he tracked it to a drug house in Venice.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.110
Who's passing the bills?

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.430
Guy on a motorcycle.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.957
Five bills on separate trips,
all late morning.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.474
Okay, what's the address?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.360
No, no, no!

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.795
They're already there.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.838
DEA cleared them, not you.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.834
You screw up a DEA operation
on top of that 48K,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.719
your ass is gonna be back in Miami!

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.200
Wait, Clay's there, and I'm not?

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.274
You better stop working that California
pussy and start working the case!

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.835
Oh, good, you're early.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.112
I'm glad you're here. We gotta run.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.639
Hey, uh, who's that woman in there?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.029
Oh, she's still here?

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.553
- Thanks for everything.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.473
- Call me.
- Okay.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.558
I'm watching you.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.350
Oh...

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.360
I wanna...

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.720
Good job.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.156
You stayin' out here, bro?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.437
Yeah, for sure.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.837
- That's gotta be them.
- What?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.400
That's gotta be them right there.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.870
What is that, some kind of special FBI app?

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.675
It's "Find My iPhone."
I have Clay's password.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.360
You don't have my password, do you?

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.955
Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.950
Yeah, that's it.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.349
- We just wait now?
- Yeah.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.035
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.953
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.510
Look, we're becoming friends,
and I don't wanna make you uncomfortable.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.120
But that girl that was
leaving your apartment...

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.270
Yeah.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.192
I just hope that you're not preying on girls
with low self-esteem to feed your addiction.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.920
Low self-esteem? What?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.030
I mean, look... She was a,
and I'm being generous here, a two...

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.600
A two?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.911
She deserves more than a one-night stand.
She seemed nice.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.390
Are you crazy? That girl's an eight!

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.880
You think she's an eight?

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.713
How are you judging them? By their hair?

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.031
How straight their teeth are? Their skin?

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.714
- I don't understand.
- Yeah.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.236
That's really shallow, bro. Come on.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.550
What?

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.950
Tina's really confident, man,
and really sexy.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.110
I mean, that's sexy.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.078
She's a full-blown eight.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.230
I hope you're right, man.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.076
Real talk.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.711
She ate my butt.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.350
I'm sorry, she did what?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.960
She ate my butt.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.195
She ate your ass?

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.869
- Yeah.
- Did you eat hers?

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.076
- Of course!
- "Of course"?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.390
What are you talking about?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.552
- That's standard.
- You think that's standard?

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.598
- Absolutely.
- To eat someone's ass?

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.240
- You think that's standard?
- Yes.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.720
That is not standard.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.917
You know what it is?
You've been married for way too long.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.634
Everyone's eating everyone's ass now.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.271
There is no way
everybody's eating everyone's ass.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.272
- Everyone's eating everyone's ass.
- No, it's impossible!

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.113
- Everyone is not.
- They are.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.600
What about hygiene?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.836
Oh, easy.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.074
If you go to the bathroom, and you see
some baby wipes, green light.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.119
Okay, what if you don't see baby wipes?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.235
I still do it.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.915
Fuck it, right? I'm only here once, you know?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.793
Oh-oh, is that our guy?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.355
Listen, I gotta tell you something.
I cannot shoot. I can't aim.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.113
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.800
Okay, don't shoot.
I do all the shooting, okay?

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.475
Okay, I'll corral them to you.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.916
Okay, here we go.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.793
I'm gonna post up on the corner.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.799
Just let me know as soon as he's rolling.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.630
Copy that.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.997
Oh, this is gonna smell bad.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.994
Oh, fuck.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.678
Oh, whoa!

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.513
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.069
Get down. Get down!

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.239
Jon, get 'em!

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.034
Oh, shit!

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.870
Go, go, go!

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.039
Castillo's inside. Get down here.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.710
Shit!

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.200
Oh, no!

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.879
I'm so sorry.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.598
That was like being inside of a corpse.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.829
This is 7-MARY-3 and 4. We're southbound
on Lincoln Boulevard and Rose.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.879
In pursuit of red Ducati Hypermotard.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.600
Fuck that.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.989
Out of the way!

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.799
Police! Get out of the way.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.400
Oh...

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.714
Ponch, what's your 20?

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.111
I'm somewhere in the parking structure.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.350
Fuck, shit.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.676
Over and out!

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.429
Shit.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.476
Freeze!

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.510
Damn it!

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.719
Hey, why is he chasing you?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.872
It went sideways.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.229
Hey, where'd they go?

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.516
West!

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.670
Towards the ocean!

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.194
You can't ride motorcycles on the beach!

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.756
What's on the other side of these dunes?

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.270
Well, the beach ends,
and then it's Ballona Creek.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.033
What do you mean, it ends?

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.634
Holy shit!

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.590
Holy shit!

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.192
Ponch, we're exiting the LA river.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.390
I'm on it.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.879
- Where are you, buddy?
- East.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.276
Riding east, over the 4th Street bridge!

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:10.874
Let's get those legs. Get the front.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.156
Hey, the bridge is closed!

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:17.390
Set up a road block
on both sides and box them in.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.073
Okay, drive down 6th Street! Right here.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.754
Get out of the way!

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.670
What was that?

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.274
It was paparazzi! It's fine!

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:30.760
Go, go, go!

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.276
Fucking assholes!

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:39.515
LT, it's getting fucked.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.955
Stay in character.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.274
I'll make a hole!

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.635
Roger.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.638
- What's going on?
- Training exercise.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.757
Cop to cop, what is it?

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.031
Oh, my God. You are a cop. Look at that.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.270
That's so cute.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.270
Ooh!

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.316
Oh, shit.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.960
Oh, shit, he's fucking dead.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.630
Jon!

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.390
Jon!

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.470
Jon!

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.310
Shit!

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.033
Oh, God. Jon!

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.758
Hey, Jon. Oh, fuck.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.557
Come on, buddy.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.474
EAGLE-6 to 7-MARY-3,
which way did the black truck go?

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.274
No, no, forget that.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.671
Land the bird!

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.274
Jon needs to be airlifted.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.954
What's the call?

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.155
We're setting it down.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.719
Come on, stay with us, buddy.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.109
Stay with us, Jon.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.470
Come on!

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.755
Oh...

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.037
Dr. Louis, extension 3426.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.151
Jesus, booked the whole damn floor.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.672
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.798
- Looking for Jon?
- Yeah.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.076
Oh, he's just in there.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.674
Oh, cool. How are you doing?

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.036
Oh, body's a little sore,

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.316
but I'm okay.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.675
They just discharged me.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.990
Oh, good.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.754
Yeah, I was kind of scared
when I saw your car frisbee like that.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.990
But, I'm glad you're all right.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.759
Me, too.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.310
Jon's in...

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.756
Oh, yeah, that's right. Okay, cool.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:44.950
Text me when you get home?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.190
I will.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.275
- See you in a bit.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.316
Text me.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.315
Dr. Tanaka to OR-3.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.034
Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.276
Leave me a message.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.119
Hey, Karen, this is, uh, Ponch,
Jon's partner.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.670
I'm with Jon at the LA Memorial.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.991
Uh, you should get here as quick as possible.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.074
He's in bad shape.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.150
Mmm.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.076
How are you feeling?

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.840
You sure?

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.040
How's your body?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.714
Don't lie.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.874
Yes.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.391
Photographic evidence?

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.397
Fuck, yeah.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.034
Oh, shit.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.599
Ooh, Nice toes.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.873
Wait, slow down. Slower, slower.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.640
Oh, fuck.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.916
Just a little bit.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.070
Oh, wow.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.393
I didn't know you had those.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.240
Wow, those look huge.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.276
Those look big tonight. Wait.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.113
No.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.152
They always look this huge,

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.317
- Officer Pantera.
- Oh! Oh!

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.314
- Oh! Oh!
- What was that sexy scream?

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.510
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.670
Oh! Oh, no.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.911
Someone prematurely ejaculated.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.070
Fuck!

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.476
Fuck!

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.033
- Can you manage?
- Got it.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.316
Last one.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.994
So, what's the plan now, babe?

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.799
The second Brian gets out of the hospital,

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.953
you, Cooper, and Hansen,
you head up to Big Bear.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.635
You wait for the Brunei flight.
You get the painting and get out of there.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.310
And until then?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.111
Business as usual. They only know me.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.475
Ray, I'm really sorry about, um...

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.630
Do you want to talk about him?

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.553
No, I do not.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.472
Maybe after
I take care of your little boyfriend.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.316
So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.472
I'm gonna kill you.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.031
When I am healed,
I am gonna physically destroy you.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.760
Get the fuck out of my room.
Call Peterson. He's looking for you.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.990
My phone's broken. I can't.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.836
You torpedo the entire case,
and you broke your phone.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.151
I didn't torpedo it. We have
a suspect's head. That's a victory.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.676
Three officers and two agents
are hospitalized,

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.833
all for a severed head nobody can ID.
That's a victory to you?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.676
Listen, I'm sorry that I shot you again.
I'm sorry.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.593
Get on the bed! Get on the bed!

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.513
You ever been
in a scissor hold, motherfucker?

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.830
Huh?

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.510
There he is.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.909
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.351
Where's your breathing tube?

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.432
That was a really sexy look for you.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.592
I also have a catheter in

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.195
and I didn't wanna be too sexy for the staff.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.033
Mmm-hmm, yeah. Tone it down a little bit.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.270
Are you posted here?

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.352
I came to see you, dummy,

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.718
and just wanted to brag
about saving your life.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.870
You saved my life?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.397
I gave you CPR
and I breathed life back into you.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.592
So, when I went out cold,

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.752
you ran in and tried to kiss me?

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.912
And you said it was CPR?

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.037
Not quite! Um...

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.874
That's a little gross because
you kind of remind me of my dad.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.554
Wait, your dad was a cop?

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.870
God, no.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.509
He was just a fuck-up, kind of like you.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.797
Mmm. So flattering.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.232
I was wondering, when you get discharged,

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.959
if you wanted to, um,

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.960
take a ride back home with me?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.233
I'm available.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.071
I already left my wife a message, and
I'm pretty sure she's gonna pick me up.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.596
Is this the same wife
that hasn't been here once?

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.150
You haven't met her.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.516
I'd appreciate it if you didn't bag on her.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.670
Yeah.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.910
I'll see you around.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.596
Fuck.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.193
Pull a fucking gun on me?

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.795
- I didn't know it was you!
- You're not gonna answer your phone?

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.520
You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA
to talk to you?

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.712
My phone was broken.
I was trying to activate it...

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.837
I told you to stay away from that drug house.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.639
You gotta stop shooting Allen!

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.712
I didn't do it on purpose!
It was an accident.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.870
I was trying to shoot Ray Kurtz.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.793
Well, you missed, and he's gone.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.632
You fucked up this whole case

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.951
and when I called your captain
to find out where you were,

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.679
she told me she hadn't heard from you

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.719
since you initiated a sexual exchange
with her at 1:00 a.m.

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.633
That was my bad. That was on me.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.473
- That was an accident.
- You fucking pervert!

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.035
Just goddamn nasty!

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.714
I was trying to text
with this girl, Lindsey...

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.996
You're fired!

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.719
You're on the 11:00 a.m. back to Miami
and guess what, I'm keeping your gun.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.037
Can we just go with a warning,
instead of a full-fledged fire?

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.714
If you had been doing your job

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.475
instead of looking at all this juicy,
LA booty they got out here,

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.000
things wouldn't be so bad.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.512
Hands down, the best app for meeting girls.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.399
I just keep swiping until I meet one.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.755
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.152
Now, when you get intimate with these gals,

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.591
is oral expected?

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.832
Like, with the butt?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.878
Oh, yeah. That's standard, boss.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.355
- That's standard?
- Yes, sir.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.352
Wow, things have changed!

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.512
- Hey, it was great meeting you.
- Hey, you too.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.875
You have a good one. Be safe out there.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.236
Yeah, enjoy that app, right? Wow.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.591
Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.
Leave me a message.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.670
Oh!

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.712
- Hey!
- Oh, Ponch!

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.031
Man, am I happy to see you!

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.793
I'm sorry about this.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.917
I just got my phone working.
I got all your messages.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.400
Dude, I'm so happy you're here.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.074
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Thank you for coming.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.397
I'm really sorry, man.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.075
I would've been here when you woke up,
but I was buying a new phone.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.237
No, man, it's good. I'm all good.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.869
What do you mean, you're good?
You got hit by a truck.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.070
Yeah,

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.755
but my titanium humerus took most of the hit.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.599
It was only a five.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.910
Five out of what?

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.309
Out of ten.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.917
- Then what's a 10?
- Scrotal tear, which I've had.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.959
Nuts unravel down your leg. It's gruesome.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.110
- What?
- I know.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.590
- You sexted with Captain Lindel?
- I did.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.355
Ponch-y, she's a senior! That's pathological.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.550
She's old. She's up there.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.756
How was her body? What did that look like?

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.991
I mean, it was tight.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.072
- It was tight?
- She's confident, you know?

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.350
That's sexy. That's really sexy.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.920
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is this?

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.273
Put that, uh, right in the living room.

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.955
- Whoa, whoa.
- Thank you so much.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.117
- Excuse me, hey.
- Hey.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.270
What are you doing?

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.035
We're moving in. Are you my neighbor?
I'm Amy.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.157
You're moving into my house, though.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.755
So, no, I'm not your neighbor.
This is my house.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:09.838
No, this was Karen and Rick's house,
and now it's my house because I bought it.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.439
What's wrong, not enough chili?

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.474
No, I'm just not very hungry.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:29.117
Dude, I know you love Karen,
but can I just say one thing about her?

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.950
Yeah.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.793
Dude, she's an asshole.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.630
Okay.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.836
She's a dick.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.954
Like, end of story.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.995
I actually figured out
why you're so hell-bent on keeping her.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.310
Yeah?

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:48.350
She's the only thing left
of your glory days. You know?

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.397
Like, the money's gone. Fans are gone.
Now, the house.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.156
She's like that last bit of proof
that it even happened

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.354
and I think you're afraid
that if you lose her,

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.392
you've officially lost it all.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.670
Wow.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.990
For a guy who won't say the word "closure,"

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.278
that was a pretty profound observation.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.552
- Yeah.
- Goddamn you, Ponch-y.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.992
I'm tired now.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.600
I wish you would've told me this
five years ago.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.070
Mmm, that is career-ending.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.356
You know what sucks?

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.273
This is our only lead,
and there's no way to track this guy.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.750
There's no dental records.
He's never been finger-printed.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.196
Oh, my God! This is Reed Junior!

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.510
- Who?
- Reed Junior!

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.915
I used to compete against him.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.072
- Reed Junior?
- That's Grieves' cousin!

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.276
Grieves?

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.875
The dude I touched dicks with
in the locker room.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.918
Remember? And he was talking
about his cousin.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.196
What's his full name?

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.589
I don't know. He competed as Reed Junior.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.876
Type in "Reed Junior."

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.553
Ray Kurtz, dude! That's Ray's son!

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.030
- Oh, my God!
- That's Ray's son!

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.640
No, we go! We leave.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.120
We go? Okay.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.316
Holy shit!

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.630
Slow down.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.910
Captain Lindel.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.760
Oh, my God.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.519
What took you so long?

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.590
No!

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.992
- No, this is not what it's about.
- Oh.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.511
I was gonna say the head in the helmet,
that's Ray's son

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.871
and Brian Grieves is his nephew,
who's in the hospital.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.271
And we need to send people over
to get him in custody ASAP.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.635
Also, I need a gun,

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.235
and I need to be sworn in as an officer
of the California Highway Patrol.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.800
But you're an FBI agent?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.190
I know, but I was fired. Your honesty
was largely to blame for that.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.472
I'm sorry. I was feeling a little abandoned.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.359
I get it. But can you swear me in?

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.318
I'll swear you in if you sexy scream.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.472
No, just swear me in, please.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.950
- Please?
- You know the oath?

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.672
When we get to the hospital,
we do all the questioning, okay?

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:31.990
Yeah. Okay.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.155
"Come now, just you and your partner."

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.310
What's that?

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.755
Look at this.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.559
Are you sexting with Karen?

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.479
No, you idiot! She's handcuffed to a pole.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.830
She's being held hostage.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.400
Oh, my God.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.796
Okay. He dropped a pin.
That's where she's at.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.280
That's across the street from
the Devil's Punchbowl.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.470
We gotta take the bikes.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.233
Wait! Let's just think about this.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.160
Why are we gonna risk our life
to save your dirtbag ex-wife's?

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.350
She stole your house.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.874
You kicked my weak knee,

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.236
said my wife was fucking someone else,
and I still saved your life.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.436
You save someone when you can, Ponch.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.834
That's what a person does, especially an
officer of the law who just took the oath.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.030
You can't even ride.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.192
Listen, I've done back flips
with worse injuries than this.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.680
We're gonna need backup.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.077
Clearly, he blames us for Reed.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.038
We don't know who in this department
is in on this.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.556
- I trust you, and you trust me.
- That's true.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.798
We're like Jay-Z and Beyoncé.
We're fucking ride or die.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.429
Shit.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.195
Where's Officer Grieves?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.476
He was discharged an hour ago.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.793
Well, did someone pick him up?

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.874
A police officer, female, super pretty.

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.314
Plane leaves at Thursday at 3:00 p.m.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.870
out of Global Air in Van Nuys.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.918
There'll be a week's worth of provisions
in the cabin.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.760
When should we expect you?

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.310
You should not.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.073
All right, spoke with the nurse,

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.439
says that he left with a super pretty
CHP officer.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.598
So, it has to be Lindsey.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.319
Yeah.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.752
She's radio silent right now,
but GPS has her car

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.116
12 miles east of Palmdale.
Let's do it, folks.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.679
That is some cold shit, man,
riding the dead son's bike.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.839
You kidnap my wife,
I ride your dead son's bike.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.390
Fuck him.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.314
How the fuck is that thing gaining on us?

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.312
He's a fucking warlock, man!

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.950
Fuck!

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.270
Whoa!

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.990
Hey, what are you doing?

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.152
I can't do it.
I can't leave my uncle by himself.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.471
He told us to hide out in the cabin.
He was very clear.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.394
You're free to do that, all right,
but you're dropping me off first.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.834
There's the Devil's Punchbowl.
It's gotta be on the right.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:36.990
Here!

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.271
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a chink in the armor.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.550
Oh, bingo!

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.235
No, don't hit that! I can't jump!

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.595
You can do it.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.197
You don't even know what's on the other side!

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.352
I know it's better than what's on this side.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.793
Come on, Ponch! You can do it!

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.952
Just do it, man! Just hit it!

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.875
Just full-throttle hit it!
You gotta do it, just come over!

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.400
Come on over, okay?

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.552
You got this! You can make it!

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.949
I didn't make it!

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.074
Dude! You okay?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.277
- Damn it! Fuck!
- You okay?

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.909
This way. Come on, she's over here.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.912
Okay, we're here. It's okay.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.390
Jon! Oh, thank God!

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.600
I knew you'd come. Oh, thank God.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.069
Oh, I need your gun.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.754
I'm so happy to see you.

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.957
Dude, enough with the gratitude, okay?
Let's go!

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.150
Let's go.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.310
Get in!

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.270
Ah!

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.635
- What?
- Oh, my fingers!

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.031
- Oh, my God!
- He shot my fingers off.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.998
It's not superficial! Look!

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.480
It's okay. They can reattach them.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.040
They can reattach them! It's fine.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.953
No, they're gone, dude!

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.278
Hold on. Let me see if I can see them.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.874
Okay.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.270
I see them.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.669
Go get them.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.830
Okay, I'm going in.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.112
Oh, shit! Damn it!

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.630
Here, put them in your pocket. There you go.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.995
There's only two of them!

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.190
- Huh?
- There's only two!

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.158
You're gonna have to make do! Two is enough!

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.720
No! I want my fucking pinky!

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.912
They're coming at us! Go, go, go!

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:32.350
Go, go, go!

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.550
Ah! Jon!

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.677
Get up, you fucking rat! Get up!

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.111
Eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.192
A fucking head for a head!

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.190
Cover me!

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.679
That was my son!

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.237
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.430
Get up!

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.590
Are you okay?

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.910
Yeah. Take my gun.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.309
No. You're a better shot than me.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.914
How am I supposed to do it?

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:58.436
Like Jimi Hendrix-style,
with my fucking teeth? Take it!

01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.716
Man up, Jon!

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.712
Yeah, okay. I'll do it.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.234
Oh, shit.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.390
What?

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:08.270
Jesus, Jon!

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.989
Just hit him, Jon!

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.597
Okay, you're hitting 10° to the right.
You gotta aim 10° to the left, okay? Go!

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.796
Okay.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.755
- Are you aimed 10° to the left?
- Yeah, but...

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.070
Fire!

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.630
Ah!

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.478
Dude, that was 10°.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.599
No, it wasn't! That was more like 20°.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.633
Dude, you think he's in one piece?

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.474
Come on!

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.432
Stay down!

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.990
Give me your fucking arm! Stay down!

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.353
What's your plan? The doors are all shut.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.273
Where we're going, we don't need doors.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.270
Is this the same hole
you crashed into earlier?

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.156
I think it is.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.872
Watch out! Jesus!

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.675
He's up!

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.160
God damn it.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.312
Go, go, go! He's getting away!

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.198
Put your hands behind your back.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.390
Oh!

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.670
Now!

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You didn't see that coming.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.311
Hot and helpful! See, it's not either or.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.711
Hey, Ray. How do those cuffs feel?

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.312
Repeat the question.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.550
Go ahead!

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.159
You're with this piece of shit?

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.549
Shut up!

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.350
Let me get this straight.

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.718
You knew that I killed
three of my co-workers,

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.191
but you thought it was okay to kill my son?

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.675
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.675
No. Your beef's with the steel cable, not us.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.990
We were just chasing him.

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.717
You weren't as good as Reed.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.510
My son should be here with me right now.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.396
Not you.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.235
No!

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.190
- Whoa!
- What the... Oh, my God, dude!

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.394
Oh, my God. Dude, that's a ricochet.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.590
Whoa!

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.917
Stay down, gorgeous asshole!

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.869
Dude, your arm is straight up titanium,
like a Terminator's arm!

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.315
Yeah. I told you.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.756
Oh, whoa. Do you feel this?

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.239
Uh, yeah, a little bit.
Like a two out of ten.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.160
- Whoa.
- Get off of me!

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.556
You feel this?

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.713
- Ah! Oh!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.593
God, don't touch my nubs!

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.632
I won't. Help me up.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.513
Come on.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.633
Dude, we gotta find an ambulance.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.837
- What?
- Oh! We gotta get your pinky!

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.754
- Oh, duh! Thanks.
- Yeah, it's over here.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.752
Back up, you're on Ponch's pinky!

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.194
I saw a look on your face tonight I haven't
seen in years, not since you competed.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.353
I can tell you really like this thing,
being a cop.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:36.355
Yeah, I really do,
maybe even more than riding.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.117
Do you want me to ride
in the ambulance with you?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.276
No, I'm good. You're kind of a dick.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.999
I'm gonna ride with Ponch.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.834
Take care, Karen.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.038
Hey, you all right?

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.318
Yeah, are you okay?
You tackled her like crazy.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.437
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm a fucking beast.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.154
Hey, do you wanna ride with us?

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.834
It depends. Are you gonna put out?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.640
Yeah, ass, cash, or grass. I know the rules.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.675
Hey, that's looking really awful.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.194
You want some morphine?

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.079
That'd be nice.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.397
Um, excuse me, Ava?

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.676
Uh, yes, Jon?

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.672
I'm really sorry

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.520
I didn't take that ride home with you
from the hospital.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.353
That was just a very stupid decision.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.630
Hmm.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.319
I'm sorry I said mean things about your wife.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.995
Even if she is a piece of shit,
it's just not nice.

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.879
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.198
You look a little short of breath.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.840
Do you need some CPR?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.878
- So bad. Really bad.
- Yeah?

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.714
Oh, oof.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.390
Aye.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.872
I'm so proud of this guy.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.592
- Get it, Jon. Get it.
- Oof.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.515
Oh...

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.275
We should be good though.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.796
Yeah. Be classy.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.758
Always classy.

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.400
- Let them do their thing.
- Yeah.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.677
- Hey, um... Hey, Ponch?
- Mm-hmm?

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.400
Could you maybe speak in Spanish,
so I don't understand what you're saying?

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.114
- No problem.
- Thanks, boss.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.711
I speak Spanish, pervs.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.310
Yes, sir?

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.472
Hey, how'd you like to come back to Miami?

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.074
I wanna give you your job back.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.438
Yeah, I appreciate that,
but I actually love it out here.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.320
California love!

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.079
California knows how to party

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.517
California

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.592
Knows how to party

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.476
In the city of LA

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:24.836
In the city of good ol' Watts

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.117
In the city, the city of Compton

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.432
Keep it rocking

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.952
Keep it rocking

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:39.514
