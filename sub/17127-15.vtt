I´M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
 TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER.

10:37.868 --> 10:39.169

10:39.169 --> 10:41.271
SHE BROKE UP WITH THIS BOY,
 ADAM CONNERS,

10:41.271 --> 10:44.044
AND HE STARTED TELLING EVERYBODY
 HE HAD SEX WITH HER.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.146
NOW A BUNCH OF GIRLS
 ARE PICKING ON HER,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.748
AND ONE OF THEM,

 IN SHAVING CREAM.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.752

 ARE YOU SURE?

10:51.752 --> 10:54.424
YEAH, I´M SURE. MY DAUGHTER
 TOLD ME SHE WROTE IT.

10:54.424 --> 10:56.386
GEORGE, UNLESS YOU HAVE
 AN EYEWITNESS,

10:56.386 --> 10:59.059
PIPER´S AN HONOR STUDENT,
 CLASS PRESIDENT,

10:59.059 --> 11:01.131
AND ONE OF THE STARS
 OF THIS SCHOOL.

11:01.131 --> 11:05.165
CARMEN...WELL,
 SHE GOES HERE.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.997
MY DAUGHTER DOESN´T LIE.

11:06.997 --> 11:09.269
I WANT THOSE GIRLS BROUGHT
 IN HERE AND PUNISHED RIGHT NOW.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.801
I CAN´T DO THAT.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.442
YOU KNOW THERE´S TWO SIDES
 TO EVERY STORY.

11:12.442 --> 11:14.805
SO YOU´RE SIDING WITH PIPER.
 THIS MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

11:14.805 --> 11:16.977
YOU´RE A BULLY, SO YOU´RE
 SIDING WITH THE BULLIES!

11:16.977 --> 11:18.678
BULLY?!

11:18.678 --> 11:21.211
WHY DON´T YOU COME ON THIS SIDE
 OF THE DESK AND SAY THAT?!

11:21.211 --> 11:25.856
ARE THERE ANY OTHER CONFLICT
 GUYS I COULD TALK TO?

11:25.856 --> 11:26.957
I´M SORRY.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.359
GOT A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL.

11:29.359 --> 11:33.764
I GOT SOME BLOOD-SUGAR ISSUES
 I´M WORKING ON.

11:36.767 --> 11:38.328
WHEW.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.731
I´M WORRIED ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.
 WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THIS?

11:40.731 --> 11:42.002
I´LL LOOK INTO IT.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.774
BUT, RANGO TO SPUDS,
 I´M TELLING YOU,

11:43.774 --> 11:45.936
THIS WHOLE THING WILL BLOW
 OVER IN A WEEK.

11:45.936 --> 11:49.780

 WILL GO BACK TO BEING...

THE SAME ANONYMOUS "C" STUDENT
 SHE WAS BEFORE.

11:53.243 --> 11:55.345
THAT´S ALL I´M ASKING FOR.

12:01.892 --> 12:02.923
CARMEN, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:02.923 --> 12:03.924

 GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT.

12:16.366 --> 12:18.939
IT´S A PILLOW SO YOU´LL BE
 MORE COMFORTABLE.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.072

 YOU SPEND ON YOUR BACK.

12:22.072 --> 12:24.514
SCREW YOU, PIPER.

12:24.514 --> 12:26.046

12:35.125 --> 12:38.228
I WALK IN, AND THERE HE IS --
 TOMMY "RANGO" DURANGO.

12:38.228 --> 12:39.860
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?!

12:39.860 --> 12:42.963
THE CONFLICT MANAGER IS MY BULLY
 FROM GRADE SCHOOL.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.796
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE
 MET HIM, GEORGE,

12:45.796 --> 12:48.768
BUT SOMEBODY DIDN´T WAIT
 FOR OUR E-PPOINTMENT.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.370
I´M SORRY, ANGIE.
 I COULDN´T WAIT.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.003
THIS GUY SAID CARMEN´S PROBLEMS
 ARE GONNA BLOW OVER.

12:53.003 --> 12:54.805
BUT I´M STARTING TO THINK

12:54.805 --> 12:57.978
THIS GUY´S DOING NOTHING ON
 PURPOSE JUST TO GET BACK AT ME.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.549
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

13:00.981 --> 13:04.254
IF I GET EXPELLED FOR THIS,
 YOU´RE DEAD!

13:04.254 --> 13:05.455

13:05.455 --> 13:06.857

13:15.996 --> 13:18.869
COME ON, GEORGE.
 YOU´RE JUST BEING PARANOID.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.901

SO YOU´RE NOT STILL MAD I FORGOT
 TO WEAR MY JACKET

13:23.133 --> 13:24.004

13:24.004 --> 13:25.135
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.276
DOESN´T BOTHER YOU AT ALL?
 NOPE.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.078
SO YOU´RE OVER IT?
 OF COURSE.

13:28.078 --> 13:31.211
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE FACT
 THAT THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE

13:31.211 --> 13:33.884
WAS JUST CASUAL SATURDAY
 TO YOU.

13:33.884 --> 13:37.187

13:38.418 --> 13:41.892
I´M GLAD YOU´RE OVER IT.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.096
CARMEN, WHAT HAPPENED?

13:46.096 --> 13:47.898
I GOT IN A FIGHT WITH PIPER.

13:47.898 --> 13:51.531
