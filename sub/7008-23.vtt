WEBVTT

00:05.169 --> 00:08.196
It's not like Tim to be late.
We go on in a couple of minutes.

00:08.272 --> 00:10.832
He said he was going out for an hour.
He should be back by now.

00:12.543 --> 00:14.048
- God!
- Well, maybe something happened.

00:14.078 --> 00:16.239
Hey, what a day!

00:16.347 --> 00:19.374
My dream lunch.
Two for one on pierogies from Stan's.

00:19.450 --> 00:22.010
Tim, you had us worried sick!
I thought you were dead in a ditch!

00:22.086 --> 00:24.817
- Al? Pierogi?
- You betcha!

00:24.889 --> 00:26.983
- Me, too.
- You guys hurry up.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.219
We got a show to do.

00:28.292 --> 00:32.058
Well, you may not want to do the show
once you find out what Binford did.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.294
"To whom it may concern,

00:35.366 --> 00:38.996
"only Binford tools are to be used
on <i>Tool Time</i> effective immediately."

00:39.070 --> 00:43.007
So what?
They always send me this memo.

00:43.074 --> 00:46.374
One more and my whole door
is covered.

00:46.444 --> 00:48.572
Well, this time our CEO
means business.

00:48.646 --> 00:50.205
While you were at lunch, Bud came in

00:50.281 --> 00:52.216
and confiscated every tool
that isn't a Binford.

00:52.483 --> 00:54.577
Ooh!

00:55.686 --> 00:57.416
Every tool we got out there is a Binford.

00:57.488 --> 00:58.893
- Well, now, not every...
- Don't worry about it.

00:58.923 --> 01:01.129
- Let's just do the show, all right?
- Okay, everybody. Five...

01:01.159 --> 01:03.492
- Well...
- four, three, two...

01:03.561 --> 01:07.123
- Does everybody know what time it is?
<i>- Tool Time!</i>

01:07.198 --> 01:09.038
That's right.
Binford Tools is proud to present

01:09.100 --> 01:11.262
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

01:15.640 --> 01:18.667
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Heidi.

01:18.743 --> 01:22.305
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

01:22.413 --> 01:26.043
And of course, you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

01:28.519 --> 01:29.885
All right.

01:29.954 --> 01:33.049
Now, all of us take our car to the
mechanic now and then for a tune-up.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.684
- But do we really know what they do?
- I do.

01:36.928 --> 01:39.488
Sorry. I'm just excited
'cause I know the answer.

01:40.898 --> 01:43.004
There's nothing I like better than giving
a car a tune-up.

01:43.034 --> 01:45.731
Tightening belts, new spark plugs,
oil change, scraping my knuckles.

01:46.904 --> 01:48.463
Oh, yeah.

01:48.539 --> 01:51.976
Quickest way to find out what's going
on is to use a diagnostic machine.

01:52.043 --> 01:56.606
We'll get... Where's the diagnostic
machine? Oh, let me guess.

01:56.714 --> 01:58.478
It wasn't a Binford.

02:00.084 --> 02:02.764
Well, everyone, I guess you showed up
for no reason, thanks to my...

02:03.554 --> 02:07.582
No, no. Thanks to my friends at Binford
who removed my diagnostic machine.

02:07.658 --> 02:09.627
I'm supposed to do a tune-up!

02:09.693 --> 02:11.799
How the hell am I supposed to do it
without the machine?

02:11.829 --> 02:15.322
- I know.
- You have the answer, Al?

02:15.399 --> 02:18.767
- By using our Binford hand tools.
- Hand tools?

02:18.870 --> 02:23.240
That's right!
Trusty hand tools made by Binford.

02:23.307 --> 02:26.004
All you need is a Binford screwdriver
to listen for valve noises

02:26.077 --> 02:29.536
the old-fashioned Binford way. Heidi?

02:33.584 --> 02:38.284
Now, if you find this as dull as I do,
why don't you contact the CEO here?

02:38.356 --> 02:42.418
He's Bud Harper, care of Binford
Tools, and tell him Tim sent you.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.655
Always the kidder.

02:44.762 --> 02:49.063
Now, you want to take this and place it
against the valve head

02:49.133 --> 02:51.625
with the handle to your ear,
making sure to keep away from

02:51.702 --> 02:57.039
the alternator belt, the fan belt, and
most importantly, the electrical coil.

02:57.909 --> 03:00.208
Look at Al. Putting on a good front.

03:00.278 --> 03:03.248
But under that bearded grin,
he's just as mad about this as I am.

03:03.347 --> 03:04.781
You're a real trouper, Al.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.127 --> 03:17.891
Been there.

04:09.146 --> 04:10.307
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

04:10.381 --> 04:12.247
- Did the mail come in yet?
- No.

04:12.316 --> 04:14.355
Gosh, you'd think the post office
is trying to torture me.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.591
I mean, they know I'm waiting on
these college acceptance letters

04:16.620 --> 04:18.159
and all of a sudden the mail's
coming late.

04:18.189 --> 04:19.918
Well, it's all a diabolical plot

04:19.991 --> 04:22.756
masterminded by
the CIA, the FBI and Bill Gates.

04:24.462 --> 04:25.623
Really?

04:27.164 --> 04:30.328
- And you're going to college?
- Honey...

04:32.536 --> 04:34.698
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Dad, where'd you get the mail?

04:34.805 --> 04:36.831
From the mailbox.
Duh!

04:37.742 --> 04:40.473
I came and got it at lunch. I was hoping
for my new lingerie catalog.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.144
There could be important news in here.

04:44.248 --> 04:45.978
You know the important news?

04:46.050 --> 04:49.680
Bud has turned a good tool company
into a fascist dictatorship.

04:49.754 --> 04:52.918
So what, he's gonna declare war
on Home Depot?

04:54.925 --> 04:56.291
You know, this is serious.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.832
We're not allowed to use any tools
on the set

04:57.862 --> 04:59.300
that don't have the Binford logo
on them.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.302
And since Binford doesn't make
any automotive tools,

05:01.332 --> 05:03.665
I can't do any car-related <i>Tool Times.</i>

05:03.734 --> 05:07.262
That's ridiculous. I knew they were
giving you problems down there.

05:07.338 --> 05:10.706
- I didn't know they would go this far.
- Oh, this is just the beginning.

05:10.775 --> 05:12.313
They start taking away
your diagnostic equipment,

05:12.343 --> 05:13.914
the next thing you know your money
looks different

05:13.944 --> 05:16.846
and you're waiting in line
for vodka and toilet paper.

05:17.548 --> 05:19.210
- Hey, Mom, Dad!
- What?

05:19.283 --> 05:21.309
I got a letter from UCLA.

05:21.385 --> 05:23.081
Really? What does it say?

05:23.154 --> 05:25.026
It says I'm still a candidate
for a soccer scholarship.

05:25.056 --> 05:26.615
- All right!
- Hey! Good deal.

05:26.691 --> 05:28.529
Yeah. I thought I'd lost my chance
after that surgery.

05:28.559 --> 05:30.050
But I guess I still got a shot.

05:30.127 --> 05:33.291
It'd be great if you got into UCLA.
What else does it say?

05:33.397 --> 05:35.889
It says they want to come see me
at the Irish Hills Tournament,

05:35.966 --> 05:37.400
and check me out.

05:37.468 --> 05:39.130
That tournament is next weekend.

05:39.203 --> 05:41.934
You're not supposed to play
on your knee for another month.

05:42.006 --> 05:45.374
Well, I guess that just changed.
I'll just accelerate my rehab schedule.

05:45.476 --> 05:46.476
Double your workouts.

05:46.544 --> 05:50.504
No, I don't want you to rush it. I mean,
there's a rehab schedule for a reason.

05:52.183 --> 05:55.813
We'll just talk to his physical therapist,
who will adjust his schedule.

05:56.287 --> 05:59.746
- Or he can just work out with me.
- Call the therapist.

06:02.593 --> 06:04.892
When Bud gets back in,
tell him that I called.

06:07.331 --> 06:08.629
This is unbelievable!

06:08.699 --> 06:10.071
Every time I call Bud, he's not home.

06:10.101 --> 06:11.972
I keep getting some guy
that sounds just like Bud

06:12.002 --> 06:14.767
talking through a thick sock.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.141
Sounds like he's trying to duck you.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.939
I'll show him. I'll call him back
and pretend I'm not me.

06:22.012 --> 06:23.139
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Brad.

06:23.214 --> 06:24.546
Hi, honey.

06:24.615 --> 06:27.141
Are you limping? What?
Did you hurt your knee again?

06:27.218 --> 06:30.552
Yeah, it's a little sore. I tried doing
ball-handling skills for the first time.

06:30.621 --> 06:31.645
Here.

06:31.722 --> 06:32.993
Well, go sit down. I'll get some ice.

06:33.023 --> 06:35.458
Brad, you were supposed to
take it easy.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.224
Here, let me see this.

06:38.329 --> 06:40.594
Oh, man! Look how swollen it is.

06:40.664 --> 06:45.295
Don't panic. A little swelling is... Mongo
Jerry, look at the size of that goiter!

06:45.369 --> 06:48.806
Guys, it's just a little fluid, all right?
Professional athletes get it all the time.

06:48.873 --> 06:51.412
But you're not a professional athlete,
you're a high school student.

06:51.442 --> 06:53.604
Who's trying to get into UCLA,
the only way I know how.

06:53.677 --> 06:56.112
Well, if it still looks like this
next weekend,

06:56.180 --> 06:58.411
you're gonna have to consider
another school.

06:58.482 --> 07:01.418
Mom, without a scholarship
I couldn't get into a school like UCLA.

07:01.485 --> 07:03.420
No kidding!

07:03.487 --> 07:05.752
I don't think you should risk
hurting it again, honey.

07:05.823 --> 07:07.314
This does look pretty bad, Brad.

07:07.391 --> 07:09.897
- Oh, so now you're against me, too?
- No one is against you. Honey...

07:09.927 --> 07:12.500
We're not against you. I just don't
want you doing something foolish.

07:12.530 --> 07:13.868
I think we should call Dr. Hennessy

07:13.898 --> 07:15.403
and see what he says before
we make our decision.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.902
Think we can get an appointment
with this short notice?

07:17.968 --> 07:20.437
Drop my name,
they'll send a car.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.643
- Any messages from Bud?
- Nope.

07:25.743 --> 07:29.510
But we did get another memo,
this time about wardrobe.

07:29.613 --> 07:30.706
What about wardrobe?

07:30.781 --> 07:33.649
Well, apparently,
we're supposed to wear these.

07:38.889 --> 07:41.324
What are we? Gay exterminators?

07:49.467 --> 07:52.027
Are we actually supposed
to wear these things?

07:52.102 --> 07:55.334
Actually, one of us is supposed
to wear this.

07:58.242 --> 08:00.871
If Borland puts that on, I'm walking.

08:04.682 --> 08:07.208
How long can a knee exam take?

08:07.284 --> 08:10.652
My personal best,
about six and a half minutes, indoors.

08:15.493 --> 08:16.859
Been there.

08:21.265 --> 08:24.167
Hello? Hey, Bud.
Where the heck have you been?

08:24.235 --> 08:25.973
I've been trying to get a hold of you
for three days.

08:26.003 --> 08:28.973
What's going on at work?
Binford's... They're insane...

08:29.039 --> 08:31.406
Hold on.
Did you just call me a chicken nugget?

08:31.475 --> 08:35.503
What? Hold on. I can't... Wait a minute.
Bud, hold on. I can't... Bud?

08:35.578 --> 08:38.606
Yeah. Where are you?

08:38.682 --> 08:42.380
Bud? Bud?

08:42.453 --> 08:45.981
Hold on. Bud, come on. I can't...

08:47.625 --> 08:48.923
Sorry.

08:49.026 --> 08:50.392
I lost him!

08:52.429 --> 08:54.455
I think he's at the Big Boy
on Woodward.

08:54.532 --> 08:56.433
Maybe you should tail him.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.935
- Tail him?
- Yeah. He'd expect me.

09:00.037 --> 09:03.303
Just once I'd like to be inside
that head of yours.

09:03.841 --> 09:06.276
- You wouldn't last five minutes.
- No.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.740
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor,
would you like to come in now?

09:09.847 --> 09:10.940
Yes.

09:22.826 --> 09:25.057
- So, how's my boy?
- I'm fine.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.001
Oh, look at this.
He blew it out again, didn't he?

09:27.031 --> 09:28.499
Oh, no, no. It's just inflamed

09:28.565 --> 09:31.535
because Brad's pushing himself.
It's a slight setback.

09:31.602 --> 09:34.333
- Are you saying he shouldn't play?
- Oh, I didn't say that.

09:34.405 --> 09:37.500
- So, then I can play?
- I didn't say that either.

09:38.309 --> 09:40.938
I get the feeling you get sued a lot.

09:44.882 --> 09:48.842
Well, look, Brad's knee should be
around 85 percent by game time.

09:48.919 --> 09:52.253
- 85 percent! That's like a B-minus.
- All right!

09:54.391 --> 09:55.415
But 85 percent means

09:55.492 --> 09:57.723
that there's an increased chance
that he'll get hurt.

09:57.795 --> 09:59.423
Well, yeah... Yeah...

09:59.496 --> 10:02.933
But what if he only plays
85 percent of the time?

10:04.501 --> 10:08.029
That would eliminate
the 15 percent chance of injury!

10:08.105 --> 10:09.471
All right!

10:12.743 --> 10:14.507
Welcome to my world.

10:15.979 --> 10:17.880
Look, Brad could get in there,
you know,

10:17.948 --> 10:21.077
play the game of his life
and be fine, but...

10:21.151 --> 10:23.490
On the other hand, the knee's not
as strong as it normally is,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.183
so there is an increased chance
of serious injury.

10:26.256 --> 10:27.747
What do you mean by "serious injury"?

10:27.825 --> 10:29.930
Well, if he hurts it again there is always
the possibility

10:29.960 --> 10:32.794
of more surgery
and chronic knee problems.

10:33.564 --> 10:37.262
- This is a tough decision.
- Boy, it is!

10:37.334 --> 10:39.860
What do you want to do? Play or not?

10:40.237 --> 10:42.297
- I'm playing.
- All right. Decision's made.

10:42.373 --> 10:44.842
No!

10:44.908 --> 10:47.878
The decision's not made.
We haven't even discussed it.

10:47.978 --> 10:50.812
- Mom, Dad and I just did.
- Yeah.

10:50.881 --> 10:54.579
Excuse me. He's 17 years old.
I think we still get to have a say in this.

10:54.651 --> 10:57.416
I say that what he's doing
might be foolish.

10:57.521 --> 10:59.217
And I say it's not.

10:59.289 --> 11:00.761
- Well...
- I think we need a third opinion.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.657
Doc, what do you think?

11:02.726 --> 11:05.890
Well, you know, I got a patient
on crutches who's waiting.

11:05.963 --> 11:10.025
What's that? It's a grade-two ankle
sprain at worst. Just ice and wrap it.

11:11.168 --> 11:13.865
Look, I don't think that Brad should
risk his health like this.

11:13.937 --> 11:16.176
It's not his health. Listen to this.
Listen, listen, listen.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.937
Only 15 percent of his knees
are at risk.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.478
He's only gonna play 85 percent
of the time.

11:21.545 --> 11:24.709
So, you times that and you get... Five...
Hold on a second... Fifteen times...

11:24.815 --> 11:26.477
- Dad...
- Hold it. Just carry the five...

11:26.550 --> 11:27.882
- Dad, Dad...
- Wait a second!

11:27.951 --> 11:29.923
Dad, forget the math, all right?
The decision's been made.

11:29.953 --> 11:32.923
No. The decision has not been made.
Listen to me, Brad.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.825
I know how important UCLA is to you.

11:35.893 --> 11:37.653
Believe me, I would love to see you
go there.

11:37.695 --> 11:39.425
But you could start out
at another school

11:39.496 --> 11:41.658
and try again for the scholarship
next year.

11:41.765 --> 11:43.904
Mom, by then there's gonna be
a whole other recruiting class.

11:43.934 --> 11:45.368
Okay? I'll be ancient history.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.905
You got to strike while you got starch
in the iron.

11:47.971 --> 11:51.271
Or, I mean... You got to...
You got to go while... Wait.

11:53.076 --> 11:55.545
Look, you have a long soccer career
ahead of you.

11:55.612 --> 11:57.418
I'm just afraid if you risk blowing out
your knee now,

11:57.448 --> 12:00.418
you're never gonna play
soccer again anywhere.

12:00.517 --> 12:02.486
Mom, I can't afford to be afraid.

12:03.787 --> 12:07.155
You know, at least Dad
understands how crucial this is.

12:07.257 --> 12:09.123
Is six a prime number?

12:18.502 --> 12:22.234
What are you making over there?
It smells so good.

12:22.339 --> 12:25.867
This is my hearty beef stew.

12:26.543 --> 12:29.980
- You must have quite a crowd.
- No, no. No, no. No, just me.

12:30.047 --> 12:34.576
See, I cook it up in bulk. That way
I have lunch for the next five years.

12:36.086 --> 12:37.315
Don't you get bored?

12:37.387 --> 12:40.880
No, not at all.
See, every three years I add crackers.

12:42.192 --> 12:44.957
So, what did the doctor say
about Brad's knee?

12:45.062 --> 12:48.226
He said it's 85 percent healed.
There's a chance he'll hurt it again.

12:49.032 --> 12:50.694
So, I take it he's not gonna play?

12:50.768 --> 12:52.327
He wants to. Tim wants him to.

12:52.436 --> 12:53.907
I'm just worried about serious damage.

12:53.937 --> 12:56.031
Do you think I'm being over-protective?
Am I crazy?

12:56.106 --> 12:58.541
Well, no, you're not crazy to worry
about Brad's health,

12:58.609 --> 13:01.511
but, to an athlete, sports are
a microcosm of life,

13:01.578 --> 13:04.446
a battle of wills,
a test of strength and character.

13:04.515 --> 13:05.949
Proving yourself as a man.

13:06.016 --> 13:07.780
Go, Conquistadores!

13:09.720 --> 13:12.622
See, I was co-captain of
my high school chess team.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.483
Not too many people get hurt
playing chess.

13:15.559 --> 13:16.925
Well, that's not necessarily true.

13:16.994 --> 13:19.725
See, I dozed off once waiting
for my opponent's next move,

13:19.797 --> 13:23.097
and the next thing I knew,
I was impaled by a queen.

13:25.335 --> 13:28.396
And your point would be what?

13:28.472 --> 13:30.964
Just that I understand why
a young man like Brad

13:31.041 --> 13:33.010
would take a risk for a sport
that he loves.

13:33.076 --> 13:35.545
Well, so do I.
But you know, what I'm worried about is

13:35.612 --> 13:37.877
I just don't feel like
he's listening to his body.

13:37.948 --> 13:39.486
I didn't listen to my body for two years,

13:39.516 --> 13:40.921
and I ended up having to have
a hysterectomy.

13:40.951 --> 13:43.113
I lost my uterus, the ovaries,
the whole nine yards.

13:43.187 --> 13:46.157
Oh, that reminds me,
I got to add onions.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.389
I'm just...

13:51.462 --> 13:53.062
I'm worried about him
taking this gamble.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.224
I don't think he's even aware
of the stakes.

13:55.299 --> 13:57.768
On the other hand, Jill,
he could be aware of the stakes

13:57.834 --> 13:59.996
and he's willing to take that gamble,
just like I was

14:00.103 --> 14:04.006
in my famous queen C-four
to F-seven gambit of 1953.

14:04.374 --> 14:07.469
So, you're saying that
you think I should let him play?

14:07.544 --> 14:08.910
Jill, let me ask you something.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.471
Did you ever go against
your parents' wishes

14:11.548 --> 14:14.712
and take a risk that involved
physical danger?

14:14.785 --> 14:18.017
Yeah, I did. I married Tim.

14:31.134 --> 14:32.796
Brad's looking pretty good,
Mrs. Taylor.

14:32.869 --> 14:34.235
Yeah. Well, I hope he's ready.

14:34.304 --> 14:36.068
I'm glad you guys decided
to let him play.

14:36.173 --> 14:38.773
Yeah. Well, moments like this are
kind of unbearable for a parent.

14:39.409 --> 14:41.344
Then how do you explain Dad?

14:43.447 --> 14:46.884
- Can't hear you, Bud.
- I never try to explain your dad.

14:49.653 --> 14:52.817
- The knee's feeling pretty good.
- Well, good luck, honey.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.188
Yeah. I'm gonna need it.

14:54.258 --> 14:56.530
I guess the guy that's marking me
goes to Cal State Fullerton.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.028
He's also on the national team.

14:58.095 --> 14:59.533
You're gonna do great out there,
buddy. Come on.

14:59.563 --> 15:01.088
Right.

15:01.164 --> 15:03.103
Hey, Dad. Dad, that guy right there,
that's Steve Smith.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.897
He's one of the coaches from UCLA.

15:05.002 --> 15:07.641
You forget about him. Keep your head
on the game, all right? Come on!

15:07.671 --> 15:10.607
- Right.
- Be careful, honey!

15:12.309 --> 15:15.143
Hey, which one of you guys
is "honey"?

15:20.450 --> 15:23.386
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey.

15:24.855 --> 15:30.089
Tim "The Tool Man." Brad's father.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.220
Oh, right. Right. Mr. Taylor.

15:32.296 --> 15:34.231
Hey, that's a heck of a boy
you got there.

15:34.298 --> 15:36.529
Yeah, he is.
And I hear you're a heck of a coach.

15:36.600 --> 15:41.834
I got a little <i>Tool Time</i> combo magnet,
pen and key chain set for you.

15:43.140 --> 15:47.009
- I can't accept these.
- NCAA regulations, huh?

15:47.077 --> 15:50.445
No. My wife hates it
when I bring home cheesy crap.

15:52.916 --> 15:56.080
Got it.
This conversation never happened.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.102
Don't worry, Brad.
You'll get him next time!

16:20.510 --> 16:21.808
Go, Brad!

16:24.881 --> 16:27.578
Why's he being so tentative?

16:29.386 --> 16:32.015
Brad, take the shot! You're wide open!

16:35.492 --> 16:37.859
Heard the "wide" part.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.431
Go, Brad!

16:48.472 --> 16:49.735
Jill, don't go out there!

16:49.806 --> 16:51.775
Brad! Brad, you okay?

16:51.875 --> 16:52.875
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

16:52.943 --> 16:55.208
- No, he's not fine.
- Mom, would you get off the field?

16:55.278 --> 16:56.984
You're the one that's gonna be
getting off the field.

16:57.014 --> 16:58.380
- No, I'm not!
- Yeah, you are.

16:58.448 --> 17:00.787
Before you play any more, I want you
to have that knee looked at

17:00.817 --> 17:02.752
at the first-aid tent. Come on.

17:02.819 --> 17:06.347
Keep the weight off it. Keep the weight
off it. Come on. Use me.

17:08.258 --> 17:11.263
Honey, the next time you go out there,
you might want to put on a jock strap.

17:11.294 --> 17:12.660
Are you coming?

17:14.330 --> 17:16.993
Is it painful when you bend your knee?

17:17.901 --> 17:20.530
- No. Not at all.
- Then why did you wince?

17:20.604 --> 17:22.309
Because you're digging your nails
into my neck.

17:22.339 --> 17:24.898
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:24.974 --> 17:27.308
Brad, I really have to check out
the other games.

17:27.377 --> 17:30.006
I'm sorry I didn't get to see you
play more. Tough break.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.572
- Well, wait. I might actually go in again.
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:32.649 --> 17:34.087
Why don't you just hang out a little bit?

17:34.117 --> 17:37.053
If the trainer lets him go back,
you can really see what Brad can do.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.487
Well, I could probably spare
a few more minutes.

17:39.589 --> 17:43.151
Okay, great! I'll hang with you.
I got a bunch of jokes.

17:44.361 --> 17:47.126
Two pretzels were walking
down the street.

17:47.864 --> 17:49.628
One was a salted.

17:56.173 --> 17:59.041
Hey, Brad. Why don't you put
some weight on your knee?

18:00.243 --> 18:02.906
- How does it feel now?
- It's loosening up a little bit.

18:02.979 --> 18:05.505
All right, let me take another look.

18:05.749 --> 18:07.377
I see the bruise coming in.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.146
Oh, I knew this was bad.

18:09.219 --> 18:12.348
Actually, as long as there's no swelling,
a bruise is a good thing.

18:12.422 --> 18:14.186
It means it's just a blow to the muscle

18:14.257 --> 18:16.726
and there's no damage to
the ligaments or cartilage.

18:16.793 --> 18:18.523
So, this guy walks into a bar.

18:18.595 --> 18:21.429
He hears a voice that says,
"You're very handsome today."

18:21.498 --> 18:23.537
The guy turns to the bartender
and says, "Who said that?"

18:23.567 --> 18:28.130
The bartender says, "The peanuts.
They're complimentary."

18:28.238 --> 18:31.003
I got a million of these.

18:31.107 --> 18:36.671
A priest, a minister and a rabbi.
They're playing Twister. Oy vey!

18:39.182 --> 18:41.117
So, what's up? Can I go in or can't I?

18:41.184 --> 18:43.619
Well, you didn't twist or wrench
your knee in any way.

18:43.687 --> 18:47.954
So, it really depends on how you feel.
You guys have to make the call.

18:49.092 --> 18:50.993
Thanks.

18:51.094 --> 18:53.586
Great. By the time
we're done arguing about this,

18:53.663 --> 18:55.529
the game's gonna be over.

18:55.599 --> 18:59.263
Or we don't argue about it. You play it
safe and try for UCLA next year.

19:00.036 --> 19:03.097
Mom, this is what I've worked and
trained for for so long, you know?

19:03.173 --> 19:05.506
And I realize I'm only 85 percent
there physically.

19:05.575 --> 19:08.306
But I'm 200 percent there mentally.

19:08.378 --> 19:11.678
You know? And I know you don't think
I understand the risk, but I do.

19:12.215 --> 19:13.453
If I go out there and I injure myself,

19:13.483 --> 19:15.088
I'm prepared to live
with the consequences.

19:15.118 --> 19:17.781
Are you sure?
Because it's a big gamble.

19:17.854 --> 19:20.289
Mom, if I don't go out on that field
right now,

19:20.657 --> 19:23.593
I'm gonna wonder my whole life
whether I could have done it.

19:27.397 --> 19:30.765
Okay, get out there!
Show them what you can do. Go on!

19:30.834 --> 19:35.772
So, the chief says, "Death it is.
But first, chi-chi!"

19:39.276 --> 19:40.642
Hey, Brad's back in the game.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.578
The natives are going,
"Chi-chi! Chi-chi!"

19:50.687 --> 19:52.178
Yeah, Brad!

20:00.964 --> 20:02.262
Go, Brad!

20:22.652 --> 20:23.711
Wow!

20:23.787 --> 20:27.883
If that's how he plays now, I can't wait
to see him at 100 percent this fall.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.086
Wait! So, does that mean he's got
the scholarship?

20:30.160 --> 20:33.255
Well, his knee's obviously fine.
He's got my recommendation.

20:33.330 --> 20:37.028
You'll be hearing from us
in a week or so. Congratulations.

20:39.336 --> 20:41.305
There's our college man.

20:48.478 --> 20:50.709
Now we're gonna continue
with our week-long salute...

20:50.780 --> 20:54.683
Stop for a minute. You know, folks, I've
been doing this show for 10 years now.

20:54.751 --> 20:57.516
And Binford shows their appreciation
by taking away all my tools

20:57.621 --> 21:00.056
and making me dress like a banana?

21:01.591 --> 21:03.363
You know, I'm as much
a company man as the next guy,

21:03.393 --> 21:05.765
but eventually a Tool Man's got to do
what a Tool Man's got to do.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.492
And I'm getting out of this stupid thing.

21:08.565 --> 21:14.232
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Thanks, Heidi. Al, you with us?

21:15.238 --> 21:17.707
I don't think so, Tim.

21:18.808 --> 21:20.470
Come on, Al.
This is about integrity, man.

21:20.543 --> 21:22.774
No, I'd really... I'd rather not.

21:23.246 --> 21:24.509
- Come on.
- I'd... No...

21:24.581 --> 21:27.050
- It's about unity, Al.
- I... I... No!

21:37.427 --> 21:38.986
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>
Thank you, Heidi.

21:39.095 --> 21:40.757
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

21:40.830 --> 21:43.800
And of course you all know my
assistant, Al...

21:45.435 --> 21:49.736
Hi, everybody.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.342
First they start taking away your
diagnostic equipment.

21:52.409 --> 21:54.114
Next thing you know,
the money looks different,

21:54.144 --> 21:57.080
you're waiting in line for vodka
and diapers.

21:58.381 --> 22:01.442
- Hey, Mom, Dad!
- What?
