00:05.874 --> 00:06.580
Stan!

00:06.682 --> 00:09.116
What are you doing with my fancy jam?!

00:09.218 --> 00:10.151
I'm getting an iguana.

00:10.252 --> 00:11.586
What are you talking about?

00:11.687 --> 00:13.487
Duh! I need the jar for my crickets.

00:15.591 --> 00:17.758
The guy at the pet store
wouldn't sell me the iguana

00:17.859 --> 00:19.760
until I could show him
a big jar of crickets...

00:19.861 --> 00:22.663
to prove I could feed the iguana...
I think.

00:22.798 --> 00:24.432
I was so excited I
just ran out of there.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.133
Stan, you jerk!

00:26.235 --> 00:29.670
That was the jam I got
at Colonial Williamsburg!

00:29.771 --> 00:33.274
Now I have to go back,
and it's <i>so</i> boring!

00:34.021 --> 00:35.776
Well, if something's
that important to you,

00:35.877 --> 00:37.445
maybe put a note on it!

00:37.546 --> 00:39.480
Oven's clean.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.849
I feel like I'm always
screwing up with Francine.

00:41.950 --> 00:44.452
- You are. That's accurate.
- Gets me tense.

00:44.553 --> 00:46.854
- I feel like I'm wound so tight.
- You are.

00:46.955 --> 00:48.556
You're like a wire that's been wound

00:48.657 --> 00:50.391
around a thing super tight.

00:50.492 --> 00:52.226
That's me. You're telling my story.

00:52.327 --> 00:53.494
You got to cut loose.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.630
Cutting loose. That's the dream.

00:55.731 --> 00:57.031
Well, let's do it.

00:57.132 --> 00:58.933
You're my boy,
and I'm always here to help.

00:59.034 --> 01:00.635
Sorry, I'm kind of down to the dregs,

01:00.736 --> 01:01.969

- Are you wearing my pants?
- With your blessing.

02:48.143 --> 02:50.497
"Stan, do not drink."

02:50.846 --> 02:52.613
Was this on Francine's wine?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.282
Oh, God, this is
so much worse than the jam!

02:55.384 --> 02:57.618
Stan, it's me.
I've come to reprimand you

02:57.719 --> 02:59.820
for using Francine's jam!

03:02.809 --> 03:04.125
You know what I love
about going to the movies?

03:04.577 --> 03:05.693
Turning my phone back on.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.262
My favorite part is
clapping at random credits

03:08.397 --> 03:10.164
like I'm a Hollywood insider.

03:10.265 --> 03:11.899
That's what Barry does.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.634
He claps for the Grips.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.436
Barry? Who's Barry?

03:15.537 --> 03:16.771
My friend, Barry.

03:16.872 --> 03:19.573
Hmm. No. I don't think I've met him.

03:19.674 --> 03:21.275
You're telling me
you've never met Barry?

03:21.376 --> 03:23.444
I don't think... The Japanese kid?

03:23.545 --> 03:26.013
No, the fat one. He's super fat.

03:26.114 --> 03:28.682
Just think, you got to know Barry.

03:28.784 --> 03:30.418
I am thinking, Steve.

03:30.519 --> 03:31.819
All I do is think.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.854
This is crazy. Do... Do you know Snot?

03:33.955 --> 03:35.122
Um...

03:35.223 --> 03:37.458
Snot's not for everyone, but <i>Barry...</i>

03:37.559 --> 03:38.759
Barry's for you.

03:38.860 --> 03:40.194
This has to happen.

03:40.328 --> 03:42.163
Think I forgot my hoodie in the theater.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.330
Yeah, yeah, great. Go get it.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.532
Enjoy these last few days

03:44.633 --> 03:46.500
of being Jeff who doesn't know Barry.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.537
Arrangements must be made.
Everything has to be perfect.

03:49.638 --> 03:51.906
What if I do too much
and ruin everything?

03:52.007 --> 03:54.074
You know, I'm gonna be hands off.

03:54.176 --> 03:56.377
Let nature take its course.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.212
But... sometimes,

03:58.313 --> 04:01.615
nature needs... a little push.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.255
There are many ways to play this.

04:10.997 --> 04:12.775
The wine's out of stock everywhere.

04:12.776 --> 04:14.777
The vineyard doesn't even exist anymore.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.346
I'm screwed.

04:16.447 --> 04:18.581
Francine will never forgive
me for drinking that wine.

04:18.682 --> 04:21.084
What if we <i>made</i> the wine?
What if we just made it?

04:21.185 --> 04:22.785
Have you seen "The Martian"?

04:22.887 --> 04:25.522
If Matt Damon can grow
potatoes out of his own feces,

04:25.623 --> 04:26.389
we can do this,

04:26.425 --> 04:30.560
especially if we already had
some of Matt Damon's feces.

04:31.996 --> 04:35.131
It's dry because it's from
"School Ties."

04:36.967 --> 04:39.202
Can't have Francine
knowing what we're up to.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.906
This way,
whenever she looks out the window,

04:43.007 --> 04:44.774
she'll think you're
practicing basketball.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.776
You don't play basketball on the lawn.

04:46.877 --> 04:49.112
How about we say I'm playing
"grassketball"?

04:49.213 --> 04:50.146
Deal.

04:52.816 --> 04:56.619
Say hello to me,
Mario Vincent Sangervasi.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.354
How are we gonna make an exact replica

04:58.455 --> 04:59.689
of Francine's wine?

04:59.790 --> 05:01.624
We're gonna make it exactly the same way

05:01.725 --> 05:03.126
it was made the first time.

05:03.227 --> 05:07.063
Same vine, same soil,
imported from France.

05:07.164 --> 05:09.966
_

05:10.913 --> 05:12.535
On this day, it was sunny,

05:12.636 --> 05:14.370
so we're gonna find some sun.

05:14.471 --> 05:17.106
Two best buds following the weather,

05:17.241 --> 05:18.675
wherever it takes us...

05:18.776 --> 05:20.510
"weather" we like it or not.

05:22.094 --> 05:23.112
D'you hear that?

05:23.214 --> 05:24.681
Hey, babe, hey, I'm gonna be spending

05:24.782 --> 05:27.817
what looks like a
significant amount of time

05:27.918 --> 05:30.153
working on my jump shot in the backyard.

05:30.254 --> 05:31.988
I ask that you please not disturb me

05:32.089 --> 05:34.257
and trust that I will
come out the other side

05:34.358 --> 05:36.259
a reliable shooting
guard for this family.

05:47.204 --> 05:49.806
Who would've thought the
weather in the Loire Valley

05:49.907 --> 05:51.174
on this day in July

05:51.308 --> 05:52.742
could be exactly replicated

05:52.843 --> 05:55.378
behind a Waffle House
dumpster in Fort Worth.

05:55.479 --> 05:58.748
I almost forgot.
The wine maker smoked a pipe.

06:02.152 --> 06:04.254
And that affects the vine?

06:04.355 --> 06:06.256
It all affects the vine.

06:06.357 --> 06:08.524
And Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time"

06:08.626 --> 06:11.027
was at the top of the charts
when our wine was made.

06:11.128 --> 06:12.629
Can the vine see your outfit?

06:12.730 --> 06:14.464
This is for you.

06:15.933 --> 06:17.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Roger, stop! Roger!

06:17.635 --> 06:19.836
Oh, is my dick showing, like Cher's did?

06:19.937 --> 06:21.437
No, there's a tornado!

06:23.407 --> 06:25.041
Yeah, that's why we're here, silly.

06:27.611 --> 06:30.146
A twister hit the vines in '89!

06:30.247 --> 06:31.914
It whipped them around real good.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.917
Only the sweetest grapes
were left on the vine.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.022
This is the big mama, Stan.

06:39.123 --> 06:41.424
We got to secure the truck!

06:45.062 --> 06:46.529
Roger, the vine!

06:47.564 --> 06:49.265
Stan, the Roger!

06:54.104 --> 06:55.872
Look at us! We're farmers!

06:55.973 --> 06:58.374
Roger, it seems like we might die here.

06:58.509 --> 07:00.209
What? Why?

07:00.311 --> 07:01.911
You were just trying to help me out.

07:02.012 --> 07:03.646
I'm sorry it ended up like this.

07:03.747 --> 07:04.914
It's okay.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.649
You would've done the same for me.

07:07.751 --> 07:08.518
Uh-huh.

07:08.619 --> 07:10.053
Hey, Stan.

07:10.154 --> 07:12.188
Couldn't help but notice you
took a little pause there.

07:12.289 --> 07:13.923
W-Would you do this for me?

07:14.024 --> 07:15.692
Um...

07:15.793 --> 07:17.093
No.

07:17.194 --> 07:18.094
No, probably not.

07:18.195 --> 07:19.729
Oh.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.365
Well, you've hurt me terribly, so...

07:29.039 --> 07:30.573
There's a corpse in here!

07:33.844 --> 07:35.611
There's maggots in its mouth!

07:35.713 --> 07:39.182
I'm going out the top!

07:42.376 --> 07:44.462

07:51.907 --> 07:54.675
That's Julia. She's new in town.

07:59.748 --> 08:03.384
I heard she was hurt
terribly by a man she loved.

08:07.756 --> 08:09.624
Poor, sweet, fragile thing.

08:09.725 --> 08:12.293
I heard she's looking for a fresh start.

08:17.499 --> 08:19.467
I heard she had her bottom ribs removed

08:19.568 --> 08:21.402
so she could go down on herself.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.323
Anything here catch your eye?

08:43.424 --> 08:45.660
- This vine.
- The vine's not for sale!

08:45.761 --> 08:47.461
It's an all-too-perfect reminder

08:47.562 --> 08:49.030
of a past I never want to remember.

08:49.131 --> 08:50.398
I couldn't part with it.

08:50.499 --> 08:52.199
Now, let's get you some dried flowers.

08:52.301 --> 08:54.502
I have some peonies that are very dry,

08:54.603 --> 08:57.171
and some tulips that are
quite dry, as well.

08:57.272 --> 08:59.006
Do you have any dry roses?

08:59.107 --> 09:02.143
My roses are like bones in a desert.

09:02.244 --> 09:05.846
Oh, I haven't had a bone
in my desert in years.

09:05.947 --> 09:08.249

09:12.421 --> 09:14.055

- Wow.

09:14.156 --> 09:15.289
That's our guy.

09:15.390 --> 09:17.024
Hey, what're you guys doing here?

09:17.125 --> 09:19.293
Jeff is meeting Barry today.
I need the room.

09:19.394 --> 09:22.496
Oh, God, that's today?
I have to give Jeff his bath!

09:22.597 --> 09:25.466
You were supposed to give
him a bath last night!

09:25.567 --> 09:27.735
And <i>you</i> were supposed to go to the mall!

09:27.836 --> 09:29.537
I didn't want to go by myself.

So, why dried flowers?

10:15.751 --> 10:17.251
I think it's inspiring

10:17.352 --> 10:19.854
that something once so
vibrant and full of life

10:19.955 --> 10:21.822
can still be delicately beautiful

10:21.923 --> 10:23.524
even after so many terrible things

10:23.625 --> 10:25.025

are a little like you.

Oh, Jesse.

10:36.905 --> 10:38.272
Oh, Julia.

10:38.373 --> 10:40.708
Would you go to the
harvest festival with me?

10:40.809 --> 10:42.777
You're sweet as fudge, Jesse,

10:42.878 --> 10:45.112
but I'm just not ready
to get back out there.

10:45.213 --> 10:46.695
Aren't you awfully lonely?

10:46.695 --> 10:49.550
Oh, I have Percy, my service rooster.

10:49.651 --> 10:51.552
We look out for each other.

10:51.653 --> 10:53.320
And of course I have my vine.

10:53.422 --> 10:54.989
Your vine is dying, Julia.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.258
Let me plant it in my field, nurture it,

10:57.359 --> 10:59.627
keep it safe until it's strong again.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.762
How much is that gonna set me back?

11:01.863 --> 11:03.664
I wasn't gonna charge you.

11:03.765 --> 11:06.333
Oh, well, that's really generous of you.

11:06.435 --> 11:08.135
Your half of the fudge is six bucks.

11:08.236 --> 11:09.770
I... brought you that fudge.

11:11.773 --> 11:13.541
Oh, Jesse.

11:16.278 --> 11:19.513
Julia's perfect.
I think she's... the one.

11:19.648 --> 11:21.182
Hey, farmer boy!

11:25.935 --> 11:28.022
Is that dance still available?

11:28.123 --> 11:30.424
Dance? Did I say...
'Cause there's no dance.

11:30.525 --> 11:33.594
More just rides and games and stuff.

11:33.695 --> 11:36.163
Well, if we're not gonna dance,
then I want fried butter.

11:36.787 --> 11:38.203
_

11:40.502 --> 11:43.037
Pick your prize! I got Munions.

11:43.138 --> 11:44.672
Just like Minions, but more fun.

11:44.773 --> 11:45.906
When you touch them,

11:46.007 --> 11:48.275
you can feel the shredded
Chinese newspaper inside.

11:48.376 --> 11:49.510
Babies love the sound.

11:49.611 --> 11:51.011
I like the sound of the bell.

11:51.112 --> 11:54.381
The bell is not a prize.
It's part of the game.

11:54.483 --> 11:56.417
Jesse, I want the bell.

11:56.518 --> 11:59.487
Without the bell, my family starves!

11:59.588 --> 12:00.921
I beg you!

12:01.022 --> 12:04.825
Please take a Rastafarian Munion!

12:04.926 --> 12:06.327
Oh!

12:06.428 --> 12:10.664
Jesse, this is it!
I'm coming out of my shell!

12:10.765 --> 12:11.532
My bell!

12:13.468 --> 12:15.603
You know what? I don't even care.

12:15.704 --> 12:17.371
I've escaped my old life

12:17.472 --> 12:20.040
and all the horrible darkness of my past

12:20.141 --> 12:21.575
is behind me forever!

12:27.682 --> 12:29.917
I'd like to test my strength.

12:30.018 --> 12:31.552
Oh, I don't work here.

12:31.653 --> 12:34.121
I said, I'd like to test my strength.

12:34.222 --> 12:36.390
Uh... I guess we could wrestle.

12:36.491 --> 12:37.892
Hold daddy's butter.

12:37.993 --> 12:40.160
You're going back to your
mom's house with a Munion.

12:43.231 --> 12:44.999
I've had such a wonderful night,

12:45.100 --> 12:48.002
but I hope you understand,
I-I can't let you come inside.

12:48.103 --> 12:49.003
I respect that.

12:49.104 --> 12:51.772
So, you can either do it
on my back or my feet.

12:51.873 --> 12:53.007
Dealer's choice.

12:53.108 --> 12:54.909
Goodnight, sweet Julia!

12:56.011 --> 12:58.913
Jesse, get back here,
you stupid farm boy!

13:01.082 --> 13:03.751
Oh, that farm boy.

13:03.852 --> 13:06.921
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.

13:07.022 --> 13:08.989
Percy! Stop that clicking.

13:09.090 --> 13:10.491
Damn clicking will be the end of me.

13:11.593 --> 13:13.460
Ahh.

13:14.496 --> 13:15.296
Percy?

13:16.598 --> 13:17.932
Percy?

13:20.235 --> 13:21.402
Jesse?

13:24.750 --> 13:25.639
Stan!

13:27.008 --> 13:28.576
How'd you track me down?

13:28.677 --> 13:31.245
You kept sending me postcards
about how happy you are now

13:31.346 --> 13:33.480
and how much you like your
new friends better than me,

13:33.582 --> 13:35.983
and then you sent me driving
directions to your house.

13:36.084 --> 13:38.452
And you just had to come
and beg my forgiveness

13:38.553 --> 13:40.554
and tell me how much you appreciate me,

13:40.655 --> 13:43.290
how much you miss me,
and how much you want me back.

13:43.391 --> 13:45.526
Well, obviously you'll stop at nothing,

13:45.627 --> 13:47.294
so I might as well pack my bags

13:47.395 --> 13:50.164
and get to know this new you
you keep talking so much about.

13:50.265 --> 13:53.300
Now, it's gonna take me some
time to forgive you completely.

13:53.401 --> 13:54.702
I'm there. 100% forgiven.

13:54.803 --> 13:56.236
Get over here... You know what?

13:56.338 --> 13:57.972
You've already come so far.
I'll come to you.

13:58.073 --> 13:59.306
I'm here for the vine.

13:59.407 --> 14:01.942
The vine? This is the new you?

14:02.043 --> 14:03.811
'Cause he sure seems... Damn it, Percy!

14:03.945 --> 14:05.130
Stop the clicking!

14:05.780 --> 14:06.947
Roger, that's enough!

14:07.048 --> 14:08.315
Grab the vine. We're going home.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.517
No! I'm the one who's had enough!

14:12.087 --> 14:15.522
Oh, thank God, Jesse!
The man who hurt me is here.

14:15.657 --> 14:17.558
And you brought the whole town, perfect.

14:17.659 --> 14:19.293
Go give him the country business.

14:19.394 --> 14:21.829
And you have torches. Nice touch.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.530
Oh, this guy's got, like, a scepter.

14:23.632 --> 14:25.065
That's cool.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.067
Oh, and you're tying me up
so I'm not tempted

14:27.168 --> 14:29.403
to join the fight...
Always the gentleman.

14:29.504 --> 14:31.038
Now, here's something I can't figure.

14:31.139 --> 14:33.841
Why are these fine folks
putting on crow masks?

14:34.843 --> 14:37.378
To honor the Crow God!

14:37.512 --> 14:40.948
She's the one! Grab the sacrifice!

14:43.451 --> 14:47.921
Now drive me to safety, benevolent mob.

14:53.212 --> 14:56.881
We gather to make a
sacrifice to the Crow God.

14:56.982 --> 14:59.117
Sacrifice to the Crow God!

14:59.218 --> 15:01.286
Really, Edwin?
You gonna do this right now?

15:01.387 --> 15:03.054
"You're gonna do this right now?"

15:03.155 --> 15:05.056
You're just mad
'cause you're not head Crow guy.

15:05.157 --> 15:07.625
"Head Crow guy!" Ung...

15:07.726 --> 15:11.062
Anyway...
only the blood of a pure maiden

15:11.196 --> 15:13.031
will appease the Crow God

15:13.132 --> 15:15.700
and ensure a bountiful corn crop.

15:15.801 --> 15:18.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Pure maiden? Me?

15:18.437 --> 15:20.605
I had sex with a guy on
the truck ride over here.

15:20.706 --> 15:23.207
Now, who was he? He had a crow mask on.

15:24.209 --> 15:26.711
Ohh, it was him... brown corduroys.

15:26.812 --> 15:29.213
Her talented mouth tells lies!

15:29.315 --> 15:31.215
Bring forth the executioner.

15:40.192 --> 15:42.760
On the count of three,
I'm gonna cut your hands free.

15:42.895 --> 15:44.395
Stan?

15:44.496 --> 15:46.064
This is the guy who hurt me!

15:46.165 --> 15:48.299
Get ready for the country business,
Stan.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.667
Kill them both!

15:51.704 --> 15:53.271
Jesse, help!

15:56.530 --> 15:57.775
No, I get it, Stan.

15:58.353 --> 16:00.178
I get that they're trying to kill me.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.213
It was just hard for
me to give up the dream

16:02.314 --> 16:04.949
of you getting worked over by
a bunch of country bumpkins.

16:05.050 --> 16:06.951
I'd like to see them try.

16:07.052 --> 16:08.486
I would've been all like, "Bam, bam!

16:08.587 --> 16:09.854
Behind the door! Ba bam!"

16:09.955 --> 16:11.089
Second floor, Stan!

16:11.190 --> 16:12.924
- Bam, bam!
- And I have a machine gun!

16:14.360 --> 16:15.760
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

16:16.611 --> 16:19.130
- I'm out of ammo.
- Have some of mine.

16:19.231 --> 16:20.865
No, for real. Let's go!

16:24.636 --> 16:25.870
Just in case.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.807
This is crazy.

16:29.908 --> 16:31.876
Jeff and Barry have
been in there so long.

16:31.977 --> 16:33.311
Well, what if they don't hit it off?

16:33.412 --> 16:35.980
This is the first time
Jeff and Barry have met.

16:36.081 --> 16:38.116
They have a lot of ground to cover.

16:38.217 --> 16:39.484
I think it's a good sign.

16:39.585 --> 16:41.152
We don't know what it is!

16:41.253 --> 16:42.987
We haven't heard peep one out of them!

16:43.088 --> 16:44.655
We heard that sneeze a while ago.

16:44.757 --> 16:45.823
But no "Bless you."

16:45.924 --> 16:47.325
Oh, that is true.

16:47.459 --> 16:50.161
Maybe it was a cough.
Could be what Stan has.

16:50.262 --> 16:52.196
He hasn't been feeling well.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.401
"Maybe a cough."

16:56.502 --> 16:57.702
Maybe it was a unicorn

16:57.803 --> 16:59.370
farting its way over the rainbow.

16:59.471 --> 17:02.039
Am I the only one not
living in a fantasy world?

17:02.141 --> 17:04.541
You got this guy
swimming around smiling,

17:04.643 --> 17:06.377
playing with his
bubbles like an asshole!

17:06.478 --> 17:07.744
Hey, man, I was playing with the bubbles

17:07.846 --> 17:09.414
for like one second.

17:09.515 --> 17:12.150
No one wants Barry and Jeff
to happen more than me.

17:12.251 --> 17:14.585
More than me?!

17:14.685 --> 17:16.753
It's gorilla time.

17:16.855 --> 17:18.055
Aah!

17:18.156 --> 17:19.290
Aaaaah!

17:19.391 --> 17:20.458
Let him go!

17:20.592 --> 17:22.426
This has been a long time coming.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.529
Oh, God! This is madness!

17:24.630 --> 17:27.365
My babies are gonna kill each other!

17:27.465 --> 17:29.467
- Stop!
- We have an announcement.

17:31.637 --> 17:35.173
Jeff and I have decided...

17:35.274 --> 17:36.641
to do a project together.

17:36.742 --> 17:38.509
Oh, yeah!

17:42.214 --> 17:44.549
Everybody wins!

17:44.945 --> 17:46.175
_

17:52.257 --> 17:54.659
Quick thinking, Roger.
A dried flower shop.

17:54.793 --> 17:56.861
No one on earth would ever come in here.

17:57.321 --> 17:58.429
This is my shop.

17:58.530 --> 17:59.263
What?

17:59.299 --> 18:00.665
Well,
this is the first place they'll look.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.266
I wanted you to see it.

18:02.367 --> 18:04.836
I put a lot of work into
transforming this place.

18:04.937 --> 18:06.971
Can you believe it was
a frame shop before?

18:07.072 --> 18:09.106
But I've utterly erased
all memory of that.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.509
Now when people think of 24 Main Street,

18:11.610 --> 18:13.110
they think about one thing...

18:13.212 --> 18:15.480
buying and selling dried flowers.

18:15.581 --> 18:18.683
That's right. I buy them, too.
It's the GameStop model.

18:18.784 --> 18:20.818
I also sell PlayStation controllers.

18:22.154 --> 18:24.689
They're inside the old frame shop!

18:24.790 --> 18:26.123
Son of a bitch.

18:28.527 --> 18:31.229
We're totally surrounded.
No weapons, no way out.

18:31.330 --> 18:33.498
Sorry I got you into this, Stan.

18:33.599 --> 18:36.501
I was all hung up on how
far you would go for me.

18:36.602 --> 18:39.403
And all you wanted was to make
things right with Francine.

18:39.505 --> 18:41.405
And all you needed was this.

18:42.065 --> 18:44.542
- Francine's wine.
- I made it from our vine.

18:44.643 --> 18:45.943
I don't even need this.

18:46.044 --> 18:48.613
I slapped a fake label
on a bottle of Diet Rite.

18:48.714 --> 18:50.448
Francine said it was, and I quote,

18:50.549 --> 18:53.184
"The best wine she's
ever had in her life."

18:56.221 --> 18:57.455
If you didn't need the vine,

18:57.556 --> 18:58.723
then... then why did you come here?

18:58.824 --> 19:00.491
For you, to bring you home.

19:00.592 --> 19:02.426
But in the tornado,
you said you wouldn't...

19:02.528 --> 19:05.196
Yeah, I know. It's... It's just...

19:05.297 --> 19:08.432
It's hard for me to
talk about my feelings.

19:08.534 --> 19:09.734
I'll do it for you.

19:09.835 --> 19:11.435
Just give my hand a little squeeze

19:11.537 --> 19:13.337
if I'm barking up the right tree.

19:13.438 --> 19:15.039
You care about me, Stan.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.408
You would go to great trouble for me.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.178
Okay, we're getting somewhere.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.682
Our friendship is so profound,
it's like a love.

19:26.118 --> 19:27.552
Aww.

19:27.653 --> 19:29.954
Our love is developing
a sexual component?

19:31.123 --> 19:32.123
Oh, I felt something.

19:32.257 --> 19:33.391
I flinched 'cause of the brick.

19:33.492 --> 19:34.959
Riiiight.

19:35.060 --> 19:37.228
To our unconsummated friendship.

19:40.332 --> 19:41.832
To getting loose

19:41.934 --> 19:43.768
before we get murdered by crow people.

19:45.737 --> 19:47.605
- Oh, God!
- What do you think?

19:47.706 --> 19:50.575
There were only four grapes,
so I topped it off with gasoline

19:50.676 --> 19:52.109
and a little bit of nitroglycerine...

19:52.210 --> 19:53.411
for the tannins.

19:53.512 --> 19:54.779
That's what gives it its legs.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.014
And it pairs well with fudge.

19:57.115 --> 19:58.649
Oh, I'm fresh out. You know what?

19:58.750 --> 20:00.184
I'll just nip on over to the fudge shop.

20:00.285 --> 20:01.686
Hold up, what's this?

20:01.787 --> 20:03.521
It's my secret tunnel to the fudge shop.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.423
I can't believe you didn't mention this.

20:05.524 --> 20:08.392
Hey, I'm not particularly
proud of stealing fudge, Stan.

20:08.493 --> 20:10.161
But I am proud of my tunnel.

20:10.262 --> 20:13.064
Doesn't feel like a tunnel,
more like a lovely hallway.

20:31.984 --> 20:35.853
Where the hell did they go?
This is so frustrating.

20:35.954 --> 20:38.489
I'm starting to question if
there even is a Crow God.

20:39.791 --> 20:41.759
Look, a sign from the Crow God.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.261
I never doubted you!

20:46.665 --> 20:47.698
Whoa.

20:47.799 --> 20:50.267
This fudge is amazing.

20:50.369 --> 20:51.869
You should meet the lady who makes it.

20:51.970 --> 20:52.903
