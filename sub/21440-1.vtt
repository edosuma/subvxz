01:09.319 --> 01:10.820
[engine rumbling]

01:13.323 --> 01:14.824
[beeping]

01:29.672 --> 01:30.715
[sighs]

01:36.471 --> 01:37.680
[screams]

01:42.769 --> 01:44.354
Shiro?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.273
[Keith] He's gone.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.074
-There's nothin' out here, Coran.
-I'm sorry, Keith.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.283
[Keith] I'm comin' home.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.502
[sniffing]

02:11.714 --> 02:14.092
I'm worried it smells a bit musty.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.803
It's been a while
since I've had to look presentable.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.180
The Cubserions
just declared independence

02:19.264 --> 02:22.725
after a thousand years of oppression,
so they probably won't notice.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.979
Then why am I getting all puffed up
like a Trufalian meringue?

02:26.062 --> 02:28.731
This is going to be
a serious diplomatic meeting.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.402
Remember, Princess,
70 percent of diplomacy is appearance.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.156
Then 29 percent is manners,
decorum, formalities and chit-chat.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.700
It's really only one percent...

02:38.783 --> 02:42.078
Serious business about fighting
for the freedom of the universe?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.248
Yes. That.
Oh, and I forgot  hors d'oeuvres.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.002
Oh, that's at least two percent.
So I'll have to recalculate my...

02:49.085 --> 02:51.045
We just freed these planets.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.173
Do you really think they're ready
to come together to fight the Galra?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.885
I don't think it's a question
of wanting to fight back,

02:56.968 --> 03:00.722
but of believing that it's possible.
It's up to you to give them that faith.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.100
It should be Voltron.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.811
We can't always put the fate
of the universe

03:06.895 --> 03:08.771
in the hands of a giant weapon.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.399
At least,
that's what your father believed.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.910
About 30 ticks to the drop zone.
You ready, Kolivan?

03:22.619 --> 03:23.661
Affirmative.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.079
[laser blasts]

03:25.163 --> 03:27.790
[Lance] Hold on, evasive action underway!

03:38.092 --> 03:40.637
Lance, I think we just passed
the drop zone.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.389
We're under heavy fire.
There's no way we can stop here.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.643
-[Lance] Kolivan, any ideas?
-[Kolivan]  Open the hatch.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.353
We'll take it from here.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.858
Go! Go! Go!

04:20.051 --> 04:21.094
[whirring]

04:37.485 --> 04:40.196
Think you're pretty good, huh?
Can you handle  this?

04:48.746 --> 04:50.999
Didn't think so. Huh?

04:51.791 --> 04:53.626
Hunk, you got a fighter right on your six!

04:53.710 --> 04:57.588
Yeah, and I'm about to teach this sentry
a lesson about tailgating.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.927
-[Kolivan]  Paladins! Can you hear me?
-We hear you, what's up?

05:03.803 --> 05:06.472
We're pinned down by heavy artillery.
We need air support.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.100
[blasting]

05:14.272 --> 05:16.274
[Lance] I see it. I'll take it out.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.612
-[whirs]
-[Lance] Uh-oh!

05:23.448 --> 05:27.201
-I can't get a safe angle of attack.
-Maybe not from the front.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.046
[crashing]

05:45.178 --> 05:48.056
It appears the Galra forces
are evacuating.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.308
[Hunk] Yeah, and stay out!

05:50.391 --> 05:53.895
Let's set 'em down over there
and get ready for the parade.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.485
-[clicking]
-[girls cooing]

06:00.568 --> 06:03.613
Now this is the kind of world-saving
that a Paladin could get used to.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.990
Whoo! You got that right.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.743
Oh, methinks I'll try this one
with all the legs.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.245
-[growls]
-Nope. Still alive.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.288
[clicking]

06:12.371 --> 06:14.540
[Lance chuckles] Whoo! Yeah.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.250
[crowd] Oh!

06:16.334 --> 06:17.543
Ah!

06:22.048 --> 06:23.925
[all murmuring]

06:27.220 --> 06:28.429
Hmm...

06:32.016 --> 06:33.601
You know, based on our recent battles,

06:33.684 --> 06:36.562
it seems like the Galra Empire
is kinda just falling apart.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.564
It's more than that. Look.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.650
-Whoa!
-[clicks]

06:40.733 --> 06:43.653
[Kolivan]
Word of Voltron's triumph is spreading.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.074
Yeah, I guess the only problem is that
we can't form Voltron anymore.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.119
That cannot stand.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.621
The universe needs Voltron.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.460
[man] Lions of Voltron,

06:59.544 --> 07:02.505
the people of Puig thank you
for delivering us

07:02.588 --> 07:05.091
from the evil hands of the Galra Empire.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.969
Don't forget the Blade of Marmora.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.263
We couldn't have done it
without Kolivan and his team.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.514
It was our honor.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.183
Yes.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.187
I want to pledge to you
that every able-bodied Puigian

07:18.271 --> 07:21.023
will join Voltron
in the fight against the Galra.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.443
Speaking of Voltron, where is it?

07:23.526 --> 07:24.861
[crowd shouting] Voltron! Voltron!

07:24.944 --> 07:27.363
Voltron! Voltron!

07:27.447 --> 07:29.532
[chanting]
Voltron! Voltron! Voltron!

07:30.950 --> 07:33.703
-I think this might be a problem.
-[crowd chanting] Voltron! Voltron!

07:43.504 --> 07:45.506
[faint whirring]

07:49.969 --> 07:52.638
Oh, number five, you're back!
How was your mission?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.433
I talked to some members
of the desert tribes on Planet Kythra

07:55.516 --> 07:57.602
who have these same
large feathered ears.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.061
They're not friendly to Zarkon,

07:59.145 --> 08:01.397
but they couldn't help identify the person
in the footage.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.773
So, that's a dead-end.

08:02.857 --> 08:06.194
Now, these flappy,
loosey, pant-thingies...

08:06.277 --> 08:09.071
Are skort pantaloons. Very breathable.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.824
Right. They're traditionally worn
by the Tando people.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.367
Yes, in the Valurian quadrant.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.953
Right.
That's on the other side of the galaxy.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.456
And what's this mask thing
that they all have on their faces?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.875
[Coran] Hmm. No idea.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.879
But it appears to be the perfect blend
of fashion and function.

08:25.796 --> 08:30.635
Okay. So my brother was either taken
by intergalactic fashion pirates, or...

08:30.718 --> 08:35.472
maybe the outer reaches of these galaxies
are occupied by freedom fighters

08:35.556 --> 08:38.351
that are starting to work together
against the Galra Empire.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.770
You know, I don't mind telling you this,

08:40.852 --> 08:44.482
but I was considered a bit of
an intergalactic fashion pirate in my day.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.610
I used to have a bogwaggle-cape
that I trained to sing my theme song

08:47.693 --> 08:49.612
whenever I entered a room.
[chuckles]

08:51.697 --> 08:53.074
Maybe this will help.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.076
While I was gone
I had the system analyze

08:55.159 --> 08:57.370
the sound of the explosion
from the prison break.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.455
-[whirs]
-[explosion audio plays]

09:01.207 --> 09:02.542
[beeping]

09:04.293 --> 09:05.127
[Pidge] Huh.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.589
Nanothermite titanium-boron.
Hey, maybe we can track that.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.134
Good idea. While you do that,
I'm gonna check in with Lance and Hunk

09:12.218 --> 09:14.345
and see how things went on Planet Puig.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.681
[beeps]

09:19.141 --> 09:21.310
Don't worry, Matt. I'll find you.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.398
[Hunk] They haven't figured out
their flatbread situation,

09:25.481 --> 09:28.818
but what they do with those centipedes
is just out of this world.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.988
And they're totally ready
to join the fight against the Galra.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.072
Nice!

09:33.155 --> 09:35.658
We brought back a few of their leaders
to join the coalition.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.660
That's splendid. Excellent work!

09:37.743 --> 09:41.122
You know, I gotta say,
this is what it's all about...

09:41.205 --> 09:43.249
freein' the people, lovin' the ladies,

09:43.332 --> 09:46.544
then bombin' down the road again
looking for adventure, Voltron-style.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.005
Which brings up a little issue.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.675
They all want to see Voltron,
only we don't really have Voltron anymore.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.345
We don't have Shiro anymore, either.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.598
Everyone seems to have forgotten that.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.436
It may be difficult for us all to accept,

10:03.519 --> 10:07.440
but it is time to think about finding
a new pilot for the Black Lion.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.821
No! I'm gonna find him.

10:13.904 --> 10:18.242
Shiro is the one person who never
gave up on me. I won't give up on him.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.510
[rings]

10:58.199 --> 10:59.659
[snaps]

11:02.411 --> 11:06.332
[Haggar] No one is to be allowed
in Emperor Zarkon's chamber.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.211
Vrepit sa.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.299
-Excuse me.
-What is it, Commander Throk?

11:15.383 --> 11:18.427
Would it be possible to speak
to Zarkon today?

11:18.511 --> 11:22.932
Another planet was lost to rebellion
and I feel he must be informed.

11:23.432 --> 11:27.645
Zarkon is fully briefed
on all imperial matters.

11:27.728 --> 11:31.690
-He certainly doesn't need your input.
-Of course.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.069
It is just that I fear if we do not take
decisive action soon,

11:35.152 --> 11:37.279
the Empire will crumble completely.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.990
Rebel activity should be crushed
with our full might

11:40.074 --> 11:43.035
before more planets
are inspired to fight against us.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.539
Lotor has arrived at headquarters
at Zarkon's request

11:46.622 --> 11:48.749
to take command of the Empire.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.460
Under Zarkon's guidance, of course.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.504
Lotor?

11:53.587 --> 11:56.382
Why is he not at his father's bedside?

11:57.341 --> 12:01.929
Zarkon needs no one by his bedside.
Least of all, you.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.189
Hmm.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.946
[Allura] It is our honor
to have you all here together.

12:19.655 --> 12:25.035
I had the biggest bunker back on Puig,
but it wasn't nearly this nice.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.996
[voice gurgles]
Well, I spent the last decade

12:27.079 --> 12:29.373
sleeping in a spiny thistle thicket.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.876
You look wonderful though, Princess.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.086
I'm glad I put on my best tarp.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.007
Welcome, everyone. Welcome.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.051
I've prepared a few Earth canapés
for our distinguished guests to enjoy

12:41.135 --> 12:43.179
while we talk galactic diplomacy.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.849
The Blade of Marmora
has gathered this intelligence.

12:47.308 --> 12:51.687
As you can see, the Galra Empire
is still the most massive ruling force

12:51.770 --> 12:53.522
the universe has ever seen.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.359
The sheer size of it
is almost incomprehensible.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.197
It seems like it could rule
another 10,000 years.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.032
[shudders]

13:04.575 --> 13:07.870
Not the way I would have started
this pep talk, but okay.

13:07.953 --> 13:11.499
However, we are beginning to see signs
of increased rebel activity

13:11.582 --> 13:13.334
from within the Empire.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.338
[all gasp]

13:18.756 --> 13:21.884
We have a strategy
to bring these forces together,

13:21.967 --> 13:24.386
free more planets, grow our numbers,

13:24.470 --> 13:28.390
and accumulate an army that can defeat
the Galra in major battles.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.854
But without your help,
it will be impossible.

13:34.813 --> 13:38.234
[electronic voice] The forces
will all fight behind Voltron, right?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.444
Yes, where is Voltron?

13:41.862 --> 13:45.115
The people you see before you
are the Paladins of Voltron.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.203
Together, they pilot the mighty lions
that form the great warrior.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.546
Excellent! Can they form Voltron now?

13:58.629 --> 14:02.049
-Uh, well...
-We can't form Voltron, okay?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.718
We can fly the lions,
but Voltron is not happening.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.053
[all gasp]

14:07.888 --> 14:11.225
What he means is that right now
they can't do it, but--

14:11.308 --> 14:14.436
But nothing. Shiro is gone.
He was the Black Lion.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.480
And until we find him,
there is no Voltron.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.571
The lions are still
a substantial fighting force

14:23.654 --> 14:26.073
and this Castle
is also a considerable weapon.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.659
The Blade of Marmora can lead you.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.078
My people have been enslaved
for centuries

14:31.161 --> 14:33.163
by soldiers who look exactly like you.

14:33.747 --> 14:38.168
Yes! Our people have heard the legend
of Voltron, how  he  defeated Zarkon.

14:38.252 --> 14:42.006
That is what gave them hope.
What are we supposed to tell them now?

14:42.506 --> 14:45.009
Tell them to stand up
and fight for themselves!

14:45.092 --> 14:46.677
Voltron is gone!

14:51.891 --> 14:52.725
[whirs]

14:53.684 --> 14:55.269
[weak chuckle]

14:55.352 --> 14:56.854
Pizza roll? Pig in a blanket?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.025
I'll have a pizza roll.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.944
[crowd cheering]

15:04.028 --> 15:05.487
[roars]

15:06.322 --> 15:07.948
[blade rings]

15:08.824 --> 15:12.953
I tried to speak with Lord Zarkon today,
but the witch stopped me again.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.333
I fear the Emperor's condition
may be worse than she is telling us.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.419
I'm not sure he will ever return
to the throne.

15:20.502 --> 15:25.090
Agreed.
And now Prince Lotor is taking over?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.509
We've fought by Zarkon's side forever,

15:27.593 --> 15:30.638
and now we are passed over
by this exiled brat.

15:31.347 --> 15:36.393
I've heard rumors he fights alongside
his enlisted men like a lowly private.

15:36.477 --> 15:40.648
Worse than that, his top generals
aren't even pure Galra.

15:40.731 --> 15:44.276
They are half-breeds at best.
He has no honor.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.071
[General] Some say he allows the planets
he conquers

15:47.154 --> 15:49.949
to continue to rule themselves.

15:50.032 --> 15:54.119
-Can you imagine?
-[Throk] Clearly he's a dangerous lunatic.

15:54.203 --> 15:58.624
I've already spoken
with the other officers in my sector.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.543
They've all agreed to back me
if I fight for the throne.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.297
Normally, I would never think
of such a thing, but...

16:07.508 --> 16:09.677
What choice do we have?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.096
Then you'll support me?

16:13.722 --> 16:14.890
Yes.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.895
[blade clanging]

16:19.979 --> 16:21.647
Who's this little fellow?

16:21.730 --> 16:24.191
I don't know. I've never seen him before.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.275
[crowd cheering]

16:31.448 --> 16:33.117
[grunts, growls]

16:33.701 --> 16:34.702
[blade rings]

16:36.370 --> 16:37.496
[crowd cheers]

16:37.579 --> 16:38.497
[warrior groans]

16:38.580 --> 16:39.915
[cheering continues]

16:41.834 --> 16:43.002
[both] Huh...?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.806
Lotor!

16:59.101 --> 17:02.896
Throk. You wish to challenge me?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.357
Then come down and claim your crown.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.401
[crowd gasps]

17:14.032 --> 17:16.201
True Galra do not take the throne

17:16.285 --> 17:19.496
by stirring up insurrection
in darkened chambers.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.166
They rise through honorable rite
of combat.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.502
Defeat me here and the throne is yours.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.589
[cheering]

17:39.850 --> 17:40.893
[growls]

17:41.643 --> 17:42.811
Humph.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.730
[growls]

17:49.693 --> 17:51.195
[growls]

17:57.451 --> 17:59.286
-I gladly accept your offer.
-[crowd cheering]

17:59.369 --> 18:03.332
Now all will see
who is the rightful leader.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.966
I have fought thousands of battles

18:13.050 --> 18:15.844
and left many enemies
much more fearsome than you

18:15.928 --> 18:18.555
wasting on the battlefields.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767
-[blade whirs]
-[yells]

18:32.945 --> 18:35.572
You have flawless technique,
that I'll grant you.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.158
Still, you must realize at some point,

18:38.242 --> 18:40.828
that your repetitive attacks
are getting you nowhere.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.788
[yelling]

18:47.543 --> 18:48.377
[groans]

18:49.378 --> 18:50.963
[clangs]

18:54.633 --> 18:55.843
[grunts]

18:59.555 --> 19:01.390
Your tactics are stale.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.352
And in the end,
your own aggression is your undoing.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.272
[crowd cheering]

19:08.355 --> 19:13.026
[chanting]
Lotor! Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!

19:13.110 --> 19:16.363
Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!
Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!

19:16.446 --> 19:20.617
Lotor! Lotor! Lotor! Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!

19:20.701 --> 19:21.785
Huh?

19:26.331 --> 19:30.127
My father built our Empire
on the bones of his enemies.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.339
But the time has come
to change the old ways,

19:34.423 --> 19:38.427
and inspire not fear from those we rule,
but loyalty.

19:39.595 --> 19:43.265
We must not waste our energy
fighting to keep our subjects down,

19:43.348 --> 19:49.771
but rather multiply it, by allowing
those worthy to rise and join our ranks.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.524
[faint gasp]

19:53.066 --> 19:55.861
The Universe can no longer doubt
our strength.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.198
Each ally gained only makes us stronger,

19:59.281 --> 20:02.701
while those who continue
to stand against us...

20:02.784 --> 20:04.870
will be crushed.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.004
Lotor, we pledge our loyalty to you.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.505
Vrepit sa.

20:48.080 --> 20:54.378
[crowd chanting] Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!
Lotor! Lotor! Lotor!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.802
[purring]

21:02.886 --> 21:04.805
[footsteps approaching]

21:12.145 --> 21:13.897
That went well.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.024
The masses are easily manipulated.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.445
Have Throk transferred out
to the Ulippa System immediately.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.948
Let him rot with the ice worms.

21:51.935 --> 21:55.230
Hey, man. Listen...

21:55.314 --> 21:56.815
we all miss Shiro.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.860
I remember what a thrill it was
to meet him for the first time

21:59.943 --> 22:02.321
when the two of us carried him out
of that garrison hospital.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.782
I grew up with my dad and Matt
telling me stories about him.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.868
He was a legend at our house.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.829
[Hunk] The guy taught me
everything I know about being a pilot.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.540
Which isn't much, but that's more on me.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.919
You're not the only one hurting, man.
We're all right there with you.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.715
But you know that he would be the first
one to tell us that we have to move on.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.429
[Allura] Keith, I know
exactly how you feel.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.516
But our mission is bigger
than any one individual.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.187
Even those who are
completely irreplaceable.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.024
I know you're right.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.446
It's time to figure out
how to reform Voltron.
