stack of leaflets.

Only three more.

below northern boulevard.

we have to talk to the most.

Oh. Hi, arch.
What are you doin' anyway?

01:22.347 --> 01:26.250
Oh, geez.
The two politicians
are hard at it.

01:26.318 --> 01:30.055
Well, let me tell you somethin'.
If you're still workin'
for the Claire packer woman,

01:30.122 --> 01:33.992
you're wasting your time
'cause this district ain't
gonna put her in the assembly.

01:34.060 --> 01:38.096
That's what you think.
If we get out enough votes,
this could be a very close race.

01:38.164 --> 01:41.332
You want a hot tip?
Put your money on cohn.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.568
He's gonna win by a nose.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.039
Archie, that is not only
an old joke, that's a bad joke.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.508
And it's also
an anti-semitic joke.
That's right.

01:50.576 --> 01:53.611
It's absolutely hateful.
I'm ashamed of you, daddy.

01:53.679 --> 01:56.380
[ Mockingly ]
"I'm ashamed of you, daddy."

01:56.448 --> 01:59.317
You know something?
If I was to open a mouth
to my old man...

01:59.384 --> 02:01.319
Like you just opened
a mouth to me,

02:01.386 --> 02:03.254
he'd have let me have it
right across the kisser.

02:03.322 --> 02:06.958
Wop. Oh, excuse me. Bam.
You can't say "wop"
around here.

<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>
<i>I'll get it.</i>

02:09.428 --> 02:13.497
Oh, leave it alone. It's another
one of them election jerks

02:13.565 --> 02:16.801
I wanna see.
What is it with her
and this election?

02:16.869 --> 02:19.838
She's interested, Archie.
She's voting for
the first time.

02:19.905 --> 02:23.842
Oh, that's right.
Youth is votin'
for the first time.

02:23.909 --> 02:26.477
"And a little child
shall lead them."

02:26.545 --> 02:28.679
Whoever said that
didn't know nothin'.

02:28.748 --> 02:32.117
Look at this, daddy.
When the youth vote
does count,

02:32.184 --> 02:35.686
political parties won't
still be choosing candidates
by religion like this.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.789
This is terrible.
What's the matter with this?

02:37.857 --> 02:40.058
I call this
representative government.

02:40.126 --> 02:43.128
Salvatore, feldman,
O'Reilly, Nelson.

02:43.195 --> 02:46.765
It's an Italian, a Jew,
an irishman and
a regular American.

02:49.235 --> 02:52.103
It's what I call
a balanced ticket.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.874
Why do you always have
to label people by nationality?

02:55.941 --> 03:00.011
'Cause how else are
you gonna get the right man
for the right job?

03:00.079 --> 03:02.013
For instance,
take feldman there.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.983
He's up for treasurer.
Well, that's perfect.

03:05.050 --> 03:08.820
All them people know
how to handle money.
Know what I mean?

03:08.888 --> 03:13.191
- No, I don't.
- Then you got Salvatore
runnin' for d.A.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.559
He could keep an eye
on feldman.

03:18.764 --> 03:21.432
You know, I wanna tell you
somethin' about the Italians.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.035
When you do get
an honest one, you really
got somethin' there.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.037
Oh, come on, arch.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.406
Here you got O'Reilly,
the Mick.

03:28.473 --> 03:32.043
You can see that the graph
is equally spread around,
you know.

03:34.579 --> 03:38.382
You got Nelson,
the American guy.
He's good for tv appearances.

03:38.450 --> 03:41.585
Make the rest of them
look respectable, you know.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.923
Where do you get
all these ideas?

03:44.990 --> 03:48.159
Oh, from the college
of hard knocks, Sonny boy.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.261
I've been everywhere

03:50.329 --> 03:52.797

there is to see.
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

03:52.865 --> 03:54.799
I know people.

03:54.867 --> 03:58.502
The reason you don't know
nothin' about people is you
always got your big mouth open.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.738
You're never willin'
to listen to nobody.

04:00.806 --> 04:03.474

May I have a moment
of your time?

04:03.542 --> 04:05.877
No.

04:11.483 --> 04:15.753
Furthermore,
that Claire packer and the
whole progressive party...

04:15.821 --> 04:17.755
Is sure losers.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.757
Now if you wanna pick
a real winner--

04:19.825 --> 04:22.426
I'm not interested
in picking a "winner."

04:22.494 --> 04:25.330
Well, I knew that the day
you married this guy.

04:25.397 --> 04:28.532
Oh, that's funny, arch.
Very funny.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.569
You don't know anything
about the progressive ticket.

04:31.636 --> 04:33.571
I know one thing
about this election.

04:33.638 --> 04:39.277
It's gonna be won
by Floyd Jay lundey,
your distinguished "incrumbent."

04:39.345 --> 04:41.645
Floyd lundey?
My man.

04:41.713 --> 04:45.449
How can you be for lundey?
Look at his record.
He's against school bussing,

04:45.517 --> 04:48.920
he's voted down every
pay raise for teachers
and he's a hawk on Vietnam.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.022
A great American.

Did you bring back
the aspirin?

05:23.822 --> 05:27.292
Gloria, guess what happened
at the supermarket.

05:27.359 --> 05:30.128
They broke the code.
What code?

05:30.195 --> 05:33.731
The secret code
at ferguson's supermarket.

05:33.799 --> 05:35.733
What are you talkin' about?

05:35.801 --> 05:39.537
Ferguson's always puts
a stamp on perishable foods...

05:39.604 --> 05:42.106
That tells him
what day it came in.

05:42.174 --> 05:45.243
But it was in code,
so they knew and we didn't.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.345
But now we know.

this morning fresh
from the farm.

J. Edgar hoover.

No, he wasn't
in the store.

What do I care about them?
You don't see any schoolkids

If you don't care about school
bonds, then you don't care about

an American?
- Yes.

Your ice bag with ice.
All right, Edith.
Leave it there.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.915
The coffee will be ready
in a minute.

11:24.983 --> 11:29.987
'Cause you ain't gonna sell me
none of your progressive
pinko welfare ideas.

11:30.054 --> 11:33.157
What have you got
against welfare?
Everything.

11:33.224 --> 11:36.026
I am sick and tired
of people like you...

11:36.094 --> 11:40.998
Givin' away my hard-earned money
to a bunch of families who
ain't even related to me,

11:41.065 --> 11:45.903
which couldn't be related to me
for "complexionary" reasons,
if you know what I mean.

11:45.970 --> 11:49.807
Are you related to any
of the executives at lockheed?

11:49.874 --> 11:52.976
Huh?
Well, you must be
because you're supporting them.

11:53.044 --> 11:57.448
What are you talkin' about?
I'm talking about
government subsidy.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.517
You're giving welfare
to the rich.

11:59.584 --> 12:02.787
Welfare to the rich?
What is she--

12:02.854 --> 12:06.590
nobody in this country needs
welfare. We got the highest
standard of livin' ever.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.726
And six to seven million
people out of work.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.128
The grossest
national product.

12:11.196 --> 12:13.130
And an inflated economy.

12:13.198 --> 12:15.232
We got the strongest
country on earth.

12:15.300 --> 12:19.102
Capable of being wiped out
by the second strongest
country on earth.

12:19.170 --> 12:23.040
Not if we get them
first, lady.

12:23.107 --> 12:27.445
If we launch, then they launch,
and then we both go up. Boom!

12:27.512 --> 12:30.047
Will you tell me something?
Why is it you liberals...

12:30.114 --> 12:33.551
No matter what subject
you're talkin' about,
you always get around to that?

12:33.618 --> 12:36.354
You guys got more ways
for the world to end...

12:36.421 --> 12:38.356
Than a dog's got fleas.

12:38.423 --> 12:42.593
And you guys got a way
of wrapping up any discussion
with one simplistic line...

12:42.661 --> 12:46.430
That sounds good,
satisfies you
and solves nothing.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.566
Wanna do me a favor?
What?

12:48.633 --> 12:51.469
Scram.

12:51.536 --> 12:54.405
- Daddy, Claire's our friend!
- That's all right, Gloria.

12:54.473 --> 12:58.242
My father had a word for people
who think and talk like you.

12:58.309 --> 13:02.980
I ain't interested.
Mr. bunker,
you are a meathead.

13:10.889 --> 13:13.791
What was that word I heard?

13:13.859 --> 13:16.694
Meathead, arch.

13:16.762 --> 13:18.829
That means dead
from the neck up.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.039
We better get out of here.
He's not voting anyway,

13:29.107 --> 13:31.675
so three out of four votes
from this house isn't bad.

13:31.743 --> 13:35.479
Well, she ain't even gonna
get that, little girl, because
I just changed my mind.

13:35.547 --> 13:39.383
Here's your coffee,
miss packer.
Forget it. She's leaving.

13:39.451 --> 13:42.152
I'm gonna tell you what's
gonna happen around here.
Edith and I are gonna vote.

13:42.220 --> 13:46.757
So that's gonna cancel your
two votes. So from this house
you get zilch.

13:46.825 --> 13:50.027
But more than that,
I'm gonna follow youse into
that neighborhood tonight...

13:50.094 --> 13:52.696
And I'm gonna go over it
with a fine-tooth comb.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.198
I ain't lived around here
for 30 years for nothin'.

13:55.266 --> 13:57.835
These people around here
know Archie bunker.
They're my people.

13:57.903 --> 14:02.740
I'm gonna knock on every door
and I'm gonna say to them all,
"stick to your guns, folks.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.742
Vote for lundey!"

14:04.810 --> 14:07.044
Will you quit
breathin' on me?

14:08.279 --> 14:10.948
We're gonna see who's
gonna win this election--

14:11.015 --> 14:13.216
packer or bunker.

14:21.259 --> 14:23.794
What's this one's name?
Kleinheim.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.664
You think it's too early
in the morning?
Not on election day.

14:26.731 --> 14:29.366
Uh, hello, Mrs. kleinheim.

14:29.434 --> 14:32.837
Yeah, I rang your doorbell
last night and you weren't in.

14:32.904 --> 14:34.839
So, I was--

14:36.074 --> 14:39.810
what? No, this is not
an obscene phone call.

14:40.979 --> 14:42.613
Mrs.--

14:42.681 --> 14:46.316
Mrs. kleinheim,
this is the way
I always breathe.

14:47.752 --> 14:50.788
I-I was--
wait, wait--

14:50.856 --> 14:53.323
she's gonna call
the police.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.793
You better make
the rest of the calls.
Okay.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.061
Daddy, you're up.

14:58.129 --> 15:00.631
Up and at it, little girl.
Up and at it.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.701
What were you doing outside?
I was just outside
raisin' the flag...

15:03.768 --> 15:06.003
So that everybody includin'
the foreigners would know...

15:06.070 --> 15:09.272
That this house sits
on American soil.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.174
Coffee, everybody.

15:11.242 --> 15:14.244
Edith, I don't want no coffee
and you better hurry up
with yours...

15:14.312 --> 15:16.747
'Cause we gotta get
out of here and vote.
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

15:16.815 --> 15:21.018
- I'll get it.
- You're rarin' to go. Yesterday
you weren't gonna vote at all.

15:21.085 --> 15:24.087
That was before packer's
pinko invasion here.

15:24.155 --> 15:26.857
How do you do?
My name is George Robinson...

15:26.925 --> 15:29.459
And I represent
the gay liberation front.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.399
How do you do?

15:35.466 --> 15:37.735
This must be Mrs. Robinson.

15:41.239 --> 15:44.107
No, I'm Cynthia Nash
of the daughters of sappho.

15:44.175 --> 15:47.545
We wanted to talk to you
about our candidate
in today's election.

15:47.612 --> 15:50.614
Now hold it.
Hold it, Edith.

15:50.682 --> 15:52.883
Let me handle this, huh?

15:52.951 --> 15:56.319
Edith, don't you know
what they are?

15:56.387 --> 16:00.758
She's a daughter of sappho
and he's a gay liberator.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.063
Step aside, will you, huh?

16:07.131 --> 16:09.399
Just let me do
the talkin' here.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.635
Excuse me. Get lost.

16:18.476 --> 16:21.178
Archie,
that wasn't polite.

16:21.245 --> 16:25.182
Edith, do you have to be
a dingbat all of the time?

16:25.249 --> 16:28.385
They seemed like such
a nice couple.

16:29.554 --> 16:31.488
A couple of what?

16:34.325 --> 16:37.795
He ain't a he
and she ain't a she.

16:37.862 --> 16:40.397
I don't know
what you mean.

16:40.465 --> 16:43.701
Edith, do you remember
Richie Clifford
from across the street?

16:43.768 --> 16:46.870
He used to sit on the stoop
knittin' sweaters.

16:46.938 --> 16:49.807
Yeah. He taught me how
to cable stitch.

16:53.578 --> 16:56.179
You remember schultzy's
daughter, Maxine the cab driver,

16:56.247 --> 16:58.682
they wouldn't let into
the teamsters union?

16:58.750 --> 17:01.051
Oh, you mean butch.

17:01.119 --> 17:03.621
Yeah.

17:03.688 --> 17:05.623
Oh.

17:10.060 --> 17:13.097
You mean they're--
yeah, yeah.

17:13.164 --> 17:15.265
Tooty and fruity.

17:20.438 --> 17:23.941
Let's see what kind of garbage
they're givin' out here.
Oh, look at this.

17:24.009 --> 17:28.045
"We are citizens too.
Make it legal
for two consenting adults...

17:28.113 --> 17:32.116
To do whatever they wish
in the privacy
of their own homes."

17:32.183 --> 17:36.253
Why would they need
a law for that?
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

17:36.320 --> 17:39.657
Go have your coffee,
huh, Edith. I'll answer
the door here.

17:41.325 --> 17:43.393
Hi, Mr. bunker.
Hi, everybody.
Hello, Lionel.

17:43.461 --> 17:46.897
[ All ] Hi, Lionel.
We're just gettin' ready
to go out and vote.

17:46.965 --> 17:50.067
I'm glad I caught you
because I'm here to do
a little campaigning.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.537
Mr. bunker, I would like you
to vote for diangelo
for city council.

17:53.604 --> 17:55.839
What are you doin'
rootin' for an Italian?

17:55.907 --> 17:58.375
Oh, no, he's black.
Here's his picture.

17:58.442 --> 18:02.245
Hey, look at this.
Gee.

18:02.313 --> 18:05.115
What's this guy doin'
with an Italian name?

18:05.183 --> 18:09.086
Oh, the usual thing--
puttin' it on his letterbox,
on his checks.

18:10.321 --> 18:12.255
[ Mutters ]

18:15.093 --> 18:18.295
I mean, how come
a colored guy's got
a name like diangelo?

18:18.362 --> 18:20.297
It gets confusing,
doesn't it?

18:20.364 --> 18:24.968
There's a lot of black people
named white and a lot of
white people named black.

18:25.036 --> 18:28.772
Just the other day I was
delivering some cleaning
to a family named rockefeller.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.509
Black?
No, white. Sometimes
it works out just right.

18:41.452 --> 18:44.822
So how 'bout it, Mr. bunker?
You gonna vote for diangelo?

18:44.889 --> 18:47.390
In America we got
a secret ballot here.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.627
So all I can tell you
is that I'm gonna vote
with my conscience.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.796
Yeah, that's what
I was afraid of.

18:54.265 --> 18:56.900
Well, thanks anyway. Bye.
[ All ]
Bye, Lionel.

18:56.968 --> 18:59.402
- <i>Well, let's go get 'em.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

18:59.470 --> 19:01.905
- Go where? What are you doin'?
- We're gonna go vote.

19:01.973 --> 19:04.174
Edith, they're gonna go vote.
Come on. Hurry up.

19:04.242 --> 19:07.044
Finish the coffee, will ya!
They're getting out the door.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.312
Why can't you hurry?
See you at the polls.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.582
Come on, Edith.
Will you get your hat
and coat. Here's your bag.

19:12.650 --> 19:15.252
Hurry up. They're gettin'
ahead of us!

19:19.023 --> 19:21.825
And the voting booth
is right over there.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.927
Thank you, Mrs. Jefferson.

19:23.995 --> 19:25.929
Well, here goes.
My first time.

19:25.997 --> 19:28.298
Don't be nervous, honey.

19:35.506 --> 19:39.476
Come on, meathead.
You're holdin' up
the whole line here.

19:39.543 --> 19:43.080
Can't you see the sign?
"No electioneering."

19:43.148 --> 19:47.651
Under "s", Mrs. Edwards.
Stivic, Michael.

19:47.718 --> 19:52.256
And while you're checking,
see if he passed the
"literaracy" test there.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.226
Will you sign here, please?
Sure.

19:56.294 --> 20:00.330
Good morning, Mr. bunker.
Good morning, Edith.
Good morning, Mrs. Jefferson.

20:00.398 --> 20:03.633
What are you doing here,
Mrs. j? Picking up a couple
extra bucks for yourself?

20:05.569 --> 20:08.672
That's right.
Under "b," Mrs. Edwards.

20:08.739 --> 20:11.441
Bunker, Archibald.

20:17.481 --> 20:20.517
She didn't have to
say it that loud.

20:20.584 --> 20:23.453
Bunker, bunker.
I don't have
an Archibald bunker.

20:23.521 --> 20:25.655
Well, it's in there.
Just look a little further.

20:25.723 --> 20:28.992
- I have an Edith bunker.
- That's me.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.428
That's my wife.
She's in there.
I must be there too.

20:31.495 --> 20:34.431
Well, I can't find
your name either.

20:34.498 --> 20:37.567
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>Mrs. Jefferson?</i>
<i>It's gotta be in there.</i>

20:37.635 --> 20:39.703
When was the last time
you voted, Mr. bunker?

20:39.770 --> 20:42.405
Uh, I voted for Nixon.

20:42.473 --> 20:46.409
Well, I should have
a card here for you.
That was in 1968.

20:46.477 --> 20:50.147
No, you didn't vote
for that Nixon.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.216
That was
the Humphrey Nixon.

20:52.283 --> 20:55.518
You voted for
the Kennedy Nixon.

20:55.586 --> 20:57.787
You haven't voted
since 1960?

20:57.856 --> 21:02.459
Uh-- well, listen. I had
a lot of things to do.

21:03.594 --> 21:06.463
Something was always
comin' up.
Yeah.

21:06.530 --> 21:10.800
Once he had a bad toe spasm.
Stifle it, will you.

21:13.004 --> 21:15.138
Well, I'm awfully sorry,
Mr. bunker,

21:15.206 --> 21:19.042
but if you haven't registered
in 11 years, you're not
eligible to vote.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.511
Now, hold it.
You ain't gonna sit there...

21:21.579 --> 21:24.014
And tell me I ain't gonna
be allowed to vote
in this election!

21:24.082 --> 21:27.851
Hey, hey, hold it down now, Mac.
Now what's the trouble here?

21:27.919 --> 21:31.588
Mr. bunker
isn't registered, officer,
and I can't find his name.

21:31.655 --> 21:34.724
Well, then look in
some other book.
It must be there.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.294
I've been livin' in this
neighborhood for 30 years.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.231
I even went to school
in this buildin' here.
It's gotta be there.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.233
Is his card in the book?
No.

21:43.301 --> 21:46.904
Then you can't vote.
Now step aside and
let the lady vote.

21:46.971 --> 21:48.906
Step aside.

21:48.973 --> 21:52.642
Under "b."
"B" for baloney,
that's what that is.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.878
Why didn't you say
something about this?
Hey, hey, hey!

21:54.946 --> 21:57.180
Is this guy
botherin' you, lady?

21:57.248 --> 22:00.384
Oh, no, he's my husband.

22:00.451 --> 22:03.186
You got my sympathies.

22:03.254 --> 22:05.722
Try and keep him quiet,
will ya.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.458
Will you sign here, please,
Mrs. bunker?
Okay.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.931
And then go
right over there.
Thank you, Louise.

22:13.998 --> 22:18.635
I'll be right back, Archie.
Wait a minute.
Edith, come here.

22:18.702 --> 22:21.638
Now don't say nothin'
to the kids about
what happened over here.

22:21.705 --> 22:24.607
Oh, no, Archie, not a word.
I promise.

22:24.675 --> 22:26.876
Wait. Edith,
Edith, come here.

22:28.179 --> 22:30.113
How you gonna vote?

22:30.181 --> 22:34.284
Oh, I can't
discuss that, Archie.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.453
It's a secret ballot.

22:36.520 --> 22:40.057
Edith! Come over here
and sit down.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.694
I wanna know
how you're gonna vote.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.765
I can't tell
you that, Archie.

22:48.833 --> 22:53.570
A person's vote is between
his conscience and himself.

22:53.637 --> 22:58.208
Edith, remember
when we was married,
what the minister said?

22:58.276 --> 23:01.011
A man and his wife
are as one.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.180
It was a beautiful
thought then...

23:03.247 --> 23:05.815
And it's a beautiful
thought now.

23:05.883 --> 23:08.518
And it was never truer
than now, Edith.

23:08.586 --> 23:12.122
Because between the two of us,
we only got one vote.

23:19.998 --> 23:22.932
Because I'm registered
and you're not.

23:23.001 --> 23:26.036
Because you didn't
remind me to register.

23:26.104 --> 23:29.806
Oh, yes, I did.
How many times? Once?

23:29.874 --> 23:32.876
Really, let's forget it.

23:32.943 --> 23:35.979
Lundey needs all the help
we can give him.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.581
But you got a lot of votes
for him last night.

23:38.649 --> 23:41.718
You was out till midnight
ringin' doorbells.

23:41.785 --> 23:45.322
Edith, listen to me.
I only got as far
as kelcy's bar.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.325
I couldn't get out of there.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.627
Now, Edith,
as man and wife...

23:50.694 --> 23:54.031
We're supposed to share
everything, right?
Yeah.

23:54.098 --> 23:57.367
So I lost my vote,
you share my loss.

23:57.435 --> 24:00.504
You got your vote,
I share your gain.

24:00.571 --> 24:03.040
Fifty-fifty.
See how it works?

24:03.107 --> 24:06.443
Now, this is the way
I want you to vote our vote.

24:08.946 --> 24:11.515
<i>[ Mike ]</i>
<i>Hey, folks.</i>
<i>Dummy up.</i>

24:11.582 --> 24:13.783
Aren't you guys
gonna vote?

24:13.851 --> 24:16.119
Yeah, I better go in now.

24:17.922 --> 24:22.325
- What about you, arch?
- Oh, I already voted.
I done that.

24:22.393 --> 24:27.164
- That fast?
- Well, all I had to do was go
in and vote against packer.

24:27.231 --> 24:29.899
In and out like a shot,
that's all.

24:29.967 --> 24:32.202
Okay, see you at home.
Bye, daddy.

24:32.270 --> 24:35.205
¶ [ Whistling ]

24:46.517 --> 24:48.618
Why don't you turn on
the tv, daddy?

24:48.686 --> 24:52.456
Oh, leave it off.
There ain't nothin' but
election results on there.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.391
That's exactly
what I wanna see.

24:54.459 --> 24:58.695
If you're still hopin'
for Claire packer, forget it.
She ain't got a chance.

24:58.762 --> 25:02.699
There was a pretty big turnout
at the polls and Claire
just might squeak through.

25:02.766 --> 25:05.935
So aren't you glad
you voted, daddy, even
if it wasn't the biggie?

25:06.003 --> 25:08.605
How would you feel if Claire
packer won by just one vote?

25:08.672 --> 25:11.007
Or two.

25:34.432 --> 25:38.801
[ Man ] All in the family
was recorded on tape
before a live audience.
