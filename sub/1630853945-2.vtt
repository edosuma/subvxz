00:11.012 --> 00:13.312
Hang on, I can
smell something.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.347
-[gabrielle] dead?
-No.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.218
Like, musky.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.522
Like, I... It's not goat.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.357
Like, it's musky.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.160
Can you smell it?
I have a really acute

00:28.228 --> 00:30.229
Sense of smell
with things like that.

00:31.632 --> 00:35.200
<i> On these challenges,</i>
<i> you're usually able</i>
<i> to potentially work</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:37.202
<i> From sunup till sundown.</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:40.506
On this challenge,
we have half an hour

00:40.508 --> 00:43.509
<i> To an hour at the most</i>
<i> to get what we need done</i>

00:43.511 --> 00:46.712
And then get back in
and warm up before
it gets critical.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.214
[gabby] hey, ky, come here.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.355
[ky] that looks like
bear poop.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.523
[gabby] I thought it
looked like bear poop.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.458
Look, it's all down the trail.
One, two, three.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.361
It's definitely like
a first poop

01:02.463 --> 01:05.597
When you get out
of hibernation, I think.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.599
[narrator] <i> in the late winte</i>
<i> months of montana,</i>

01:07.601 --> 01:10.736
<i> Grizzly bears and black bear</i>
<i> emerge from hibernation</i>

01:10.838 --> 01:14.106
<i> And travel to lower elevatio</i>
<i> in search of food</i>

01:14.108 --> 01:16.108
<i> And to evacuate</i>
<i> long-held-in waste.</i>

01:16.110 --> 01:18.410

01:18.412 --> 01:20.813

01:20.815 --> 01:22.114
[ky] whoa.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.317
Is that what I think it is?

01:26.353 --> 01:28.420
Massive paw prints.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.757
They look like bear to me.

01:31.826 --> 01:34.426
-[ky] what about you?
-[gabby] I thought the same.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.028
[gabby] <i> makes us both</i>
<i> go nervous,</i>

01:36.030 --> 01:39.231
Just knowing they're in such
close proximity to our area.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.339
I think there's both grizzlies
and black bears in this area.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.808
[ky] <i> the bear tracks</i>
<i> are probably only</i>

01:49.810 --> 01:51.844
<i> A minute walk</i>
<i> from our shelter.</i>

01:51.945 --> 01:54.146

01:54.248 --> 01:55.714
<i> And they're probably</i>
<i> checking us out.</i>

01:55.716 --> 02:00.119
One thing I am looking
out for is long,
straight branches,

02:00.121 --> 02:02.387
I think we should all
carry a spear when
we come out.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.823
I just think if we can have
something that just jabs

02:04.825 --> 02:06.291
And just keeps it
at a distance,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.060
Because they are coming out
at this time of year

02:08.129 --> 02:09.862
-And they are gonna
be hungry.
-Yeah.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.243
It's snowing. [sighs]

02:27.214 --> 02:29.214
It is super, super cold
out here.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.716
I'm just completely numb.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.220
This pile right here
is jake and waz.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.725
Hopefully, we don't
get completely,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.127

It's not that I'm lacking

It's the fact that I don't

03:26.907 --> 03:29.741

03:37.818 --> 03:39.918

03:39.920 --> 03:42.221
<i> Just from sara's choice</i>
<i> of words or her tone,</i>

03:42.223 --> 03:44.489
That she really doesn't want

04:53.227 --> 04:55.027
Yeah, we need a fire going

Which means somebody has

-[trish] I don't mind

04:59.500 --> 05:02.401

05:41.608 --> 05:42.941
There's definitely regret.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.944
That pain is only temporary.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.714
It is only temporary.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.421
So, what, seven years?

05:56.423 --> 05:58.824
And I still regret leaving
out of the philippines.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.359
<i> Think I'm gonna go home.</i>

06:01.428 --> 06:04.763
<i> Regret, it lasts a lot longe</i>

06:06.100 --> 06:07.933
I might go walk that creek
a little bit

06:07.935 --> 06:10.702
And see if I cannot deal
where some food is.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.805
[rod] if you go walk
that creek, string that bow
and take an arrow.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.946
[jeremy] I just hate it,
my feet are so sensitive
to the cold.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.117

I'm fixing to go out there
and see if I can find
some beaver.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.964
I've been watching that water
move around quite a bit,

06:38.966 --> 06:40.632
And I know it's not a fish
doing that.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.201
It's all around the banks.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.104
I think it's a good chance
we got a beaver down here.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.743
Yeah, it'd mean a lot to me
to be able to get something
to eat.

We have to continue to make
improvements on the shelter.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.410
We need to get that
weather-tight and so
it holds in heat better.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.645
<i> We're gonna stack</i>
<i> this place with firewood.</i>

08:00.747 --> 08:05.317

Because it's freaking
freezing here.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.530
[jermaine] yeah, much better.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.032
[sarah] you feeling better in
the nauseousness department?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.734
-[wes] yeah.
-[sarah] okay, that's good.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.936
-[sarah] jermaine,
how about you?
-[jermaine] good.

13:25.806 --> 13:26.871
-[jermaine] good.
-[sarah] okay.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.614
The fire wall seems like
it's helped a little,

13:36.616 --> 13:39.117
As far as kinda reflecting
the heat this way.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.852
Too bad that it won't store
heat though,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.954
That goes landing on them
in the night not quite warm.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.823
-[jake] yeah.
-[sara] our sleeping
arrangement

13:44.825 --> 13:47.759
Needs to be about
a foot higher,
two feet higher.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.695
[jake] <i> our plan today</i>
<i> is we're gonna work on</i>

13:50.697 --> 13:53.398
<i> A mat to get us off</i>
<i> the ground a little bit mor</i>

13:53.400 --> 13:56.534
And then our big goal
after that's done

13:56.603 --> 13:58.536
Is to get out
and do a little hunting.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.707
[sara] <i> we need the mat</i>
<i> mainly just so we</i>

14:02.709 --> 14:04.909
<i> Can stop getting wet</i>
<i> from the ground.</i>

14:04.911 --> 14:07.111
It's literally sucking
the heat from us.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.314
[was speaking]

14:09.316 --> 14:11.950
<i> The ground's almost frozen</i>
<i> where we're staying,</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:13.718
So we're losing body heat
really quickly.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.053
The more air we can put
between the ground and us,

14:15.121 --> 14:16.421
<i> The warmer we're gonna stay</i>

14:17.123 --> 14:18.256
Good job, sara.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.328
[sara] got a ton of reed.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.963
[jake] yeah, it looks
like it, that's awesome.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.063
[sara exhales]

14:28.001 --> 14:29.801
All right, now let's see
if I can get this.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.402
I probably lost
my two holes here.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.706
[waz chuckles]

14:34.708 --> 14:38.009
-It's always the worst
case scenario with you.
-[sara] I know.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.044
[sara] I don't mean
to be so negative.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.946
[waz] <i> I don't know a lot</i>
<i> about sara,</i>

14:41.948 --> 14:43.915
But she came into this
not confident.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.050
And I wanna watch her
walk out of here

14:46.052 --> 14:47.852
With all the confidence
in the world.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.755
[sara] you know, you're not
the first person that's ever
said that to me.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.424
-[laughs] I'm not surprised.
-Holy [bleep].

14:53.426 --> 14:57.028
Waz and jake
are very motivational
and very encouraging.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.564
They are also very patient
with me.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.100
<i> I am doing things</i>
<i> that are helpful,</i>

15:02.102 --> 15:04.802
And I'm not giving myself
enough credit for it.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.238
[jake] so, are you gonna
be around here working
if we go...

15:08.041 --> 15:09.374
...Out for a bit?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.009
[sara] well, don't you want me
to tie the things together?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.310
-Yeah, that'll be awesome.
-[sara] okay.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.412
[waz] you're gonna do amazing.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.514
-[waz speaking]
-[jake] got my slingshot.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.517
-[jake] got your bow?
-[sara sniffles]

15:19.519 --> 15:21.552
[jake] okay, let's go
fetch some supper.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.055
[sara] good luck, guys.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.156
[jake] thank you.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.800
[jeremy grunts]

15:40.740 --> 15:42.407
[exhales and sniffs]

15:43.710 --> 15:46.244
It's like the grizzly first
emerged from his cave.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.549
I'm hungry.
I need something in me

15:51.618 --> 15:53.584
'cause I'm running out
of energy.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.155
[narrator] <i> in frigid weather</i>
<i> shivering burns stored</i>
<i> body fat,</i>

15:57.223 --> 16:00.158
<i> Producing heat and regulatin</i>
<i> core temperature,</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:04.128
<i> But shivering consumes</i>
<i> nearly 400 additional calori</i>
<i> per hour.</i>

16:05.632 --> 16:08.800
[jeremy] <i> I just wanna</i>
<i> get some kinda food,</i>
<i> whether it's trout...</i>

16:10.070 --> 16:12.337
<i> ...Rabbit, that'd be a huge</i>
<i> morale boost.</i>

16:13.606 --> 16:15.840
But what I've gotta do
is just remember that

16:15.909 --> 16:19.310
I can only stay out so long.
I gotta come in and warm up.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.314
If I try to stay out past
an hour or two too long,

16:23.316 --> 16:26.718
I don't want a medic
coming in here and medically
tapping me.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.625
Everybody's betting on me
to be home within seven days.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.096
My brother told me
before I came,

16:38.098 --> 16:41.032
He knows how much
I hate the cold.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.034
He said, "you'll be back
before the end of the week."

16:43.036 --> 16:45.036
How do you think I'm gonna do?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.105
I think I'll see you back
next Friday.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.406
I'll buy you a steak dinner.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.808
I'm still here.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.311
And I'm gonna be here
on day 14, walking out.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.298
[trish] <i> I am tending the fir</i>

Rod's back, not feeling good,
it hurts for him to walk.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.805
<i> And it's really cold outside</i>

17:22.008 --> 17:24.342
[rod] <i> my back right now,</i>

17:24.411 --> 17:25.643
<i> Probably a six in pain.</i>

17:25.712 --> 17:27.245
<i> I can deal with it</i>

17:27.313 --> 17:30.615
And I've been dealing with it,
you know...

17:31.551 --> 17:33.051
It's one of those things that

17:33.152 --> 17:35.019
I don't know
if it's gonna get better,
if it's gonna get worse.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.255
[trish speaking]

17:38.825 --> 17:40.625
[rod chuckles]

17:40.627 --> 17:44.262
[trish] <i> I'm always ready</i>
<i> to step up and fill in</i>
<i> where I can,</i>

17:44.330 --> 17:48.232
And I want all of us to bond

17:48.301 --> 17:51.769
[rod] <i> I know trish has done</i>
<i> other challenges,</i>

17:51.771 --> 17:54.939
It seemed like she wanted
to be her own boss

17:54.941 --> 17:57.942
And no matter what she said,
it was always taken wrong.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.812
[trish]
<i> you're micromanaging it,</i>
<i> I got the log over here.</i>

18:00.814 --> 18:03.314

<i> -Well, you don't need to.</i>

18:03.316 --> 18:06.951
<i> -I don't need</i>

<i> -Trish, shut up. Right now.</i>

18:06.953 --> 18:09.020
<i> No. I'll never</i>
[bleep] <i> shut up.</i>

18:09.022 --> 18:10.521
[rod] <i> but she's very strong</i>

18:10.523 --> 18:12.256
<i> She knows what she can do,</i>

18:12.325 --> 18:14.625
<i> She knows her skill set,</i>
<i> she knows her ability.</i>

18:14.627 --> 18:16.761
And I'm glad for her
to be here.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.730
[trish speaking]

18:29.008 --> 18:31.509
[ky] I'm still not content
with the firewood we have,

18:31.511 --> 18:33.611
Just because we almost
ran out last night.

18:33.613 --> 18:38.149
So I might let you two go
to the lake and I'll, um...

18:38.218 --> 18:40.418
...Collect a little firewood
and get that fire going,

18:40.420 --> 18:41.786
-[ky] try and warm up.
-[gabby] sounds good.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.856
[gabby]
well, we won't be long,
temperature like it is.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.157
[ky]
yeah, it's dropping rapidly.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.929
[joe shivering] so...

18:52.765 --> 18:56.834
...First time out [pants]
since day one.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.036
I am trying
to be more productive.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.305
Very much still in pain
from this cold.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.308
This is just not something...

19:04.310 --> 19:08.045
I don't think people
are meant to be out here
exposed like this.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.214
<i> Ky and gabby</i>
<i> are amazing workers.</i>

19:10.216 --> 19:12.116
<i> I wanna do the best that I c</i>

19:12.118 --> 19:13.818
Because that's what
they deserve.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.620
'cause I know they're
gonna give it to me.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.689
[coughing]

19:21.427 --> 19:24.262
-[gabby] you okay?
-[joe] it's just...

19:24.363 --> 19:27.665
I find the colder I get,
it's like my chest wants
to tighten up.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.100
[gabby] <i> if there's anybody</i>
<i> that I thought</i>

19:30.102 --> 19:31.502
<i> Would probably have</i>
<i> a hard time with the cold,</i>

19:31.504 --> 19:34.505
It's ky having literal
no body fat, so...

19:35.808 --> 19:38.509
...For joe to be struggling,
it's definitely worrisome.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.845
[joe] <i> in order to scout</i>
<i> the area and find sustenance</i>

19:40.914 --> 19:43.814
<i> We can't just sit</i>
<i> in the shelter for the next</i>
<i> two weeks,</i>

19:43.816 --> 19:46.551
<i> It's just not,</i>
<i> that's not acceptable.</i>

19:48.021 --> 19:50.154
<i> So we gotta get out there</i>
<i> and find whatever</i>
<i> it is that's here.</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:55.526
We got rabbit tracks.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.533
There are tracks leading
right under that log.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.404
Okay, more rabbit tracks
up here.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.843
Joe, I think I see the rabbit.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.313
Here.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.119
Got your machete?

20:22.121 --> 20:24.722
[joe] oh, I wish I had
a bow right now,
this is such an easy shot.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.960
He's got his eyes fixed on me.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.728
He doesn't see you there.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.304
All right. Here goes nothing.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.611
[groans] ugh.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.313
[bleeping]

20:51.651 --> 20:53.150
[gabby] I know.
It's all right.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.121
We can chase them around
if we want to.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.057
[joe] it's okay.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.827
<i> Just knowing that there's</i>
<i> something out there for us,</i>
<i> just a potential food source</i>

21:02.829 --> 21:05.162
It makes me want to push
that much harder.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.698
[gabby] let's just get back.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.233
[joe] it's still freezing
out here.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.945
[jeremy] I've been out here
in the snow for a while.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
It's some type of bird.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.551
[grunts]

21:29.122 --> 21:31.455
I'm trying to see if there's
a carcass of it around.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.828
They ate every damn bit of it.

21:41.301 --> 21:45.736
Would've been nice
to come across something
half-ate, though.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.607
I don't mind scavenging
the rest of the meat
if it's still good.

21:50.543 --> 21:54.045
[breathing heavily]

22:02.855 --> 22:04.822
[exhales]

22:04.824 --> 22:06.757
Oh, wow, my head feels so hot.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.330
[breathing heavily]

22:18.438 --> 22:20.304
[exhales] god.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.007
[shivering
and breathing heavily]

22:32.352 --> 22:34.952
[shivering and crying]

22:43.663 --> 22:45.463
[breathing heavily]

22:50.203 --> 22:52.103
It's, uh, just...

22:56.008 --> 22:57.208
[hums in disagreement]

23:06.819 --> 23:08.719
[jeremy] it's, uh, just...

23:11.824 --> 23:13.524
[crying] I'm not going home.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.261
[cameraman] I'm here.
Just take, take it easy.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.029
[sniffling, crying]

23:19.031 --> 23:20.064
[cameraman] take it easy.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.600
[jeremy steadies
his breathing]

23:31.110 --> 23:33.411
It's crazy 'cause
I'm not even cold.

23:35.348 --> 23:37.014
I'm fine.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.351
[kelsey speaking]

23:42.622 --> 23:44.955
Okay? Let me check you.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.323
[jeremy] I'm not... Mmm.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.324
[kelsey] but I need to
check on you, honey.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.126
[sighs]

23:53.232 --> 23:55.933
[kelsey] you just got up
too quick? You got
dizzy after walking?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.301
-[jeremy] I guess.
-[kelsey] okay.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.703
Can you answer some
simple questions for me?

23:59.705 --> 24:01.238
I can answer you anything.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.107
-How many quarters
make a dollar?
-Four.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.109
Four. Okay. Do you know
what state we're in?

24:05.111 --> 24:06.610
-Montana.
-Okay.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.813
And you feel like you're good
to keep trying to find food?

24:08.815 --> 24:11.148
-I will find food.
I got to eat.
-Yeah.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.018
<i> He's safe medically.</i>

24:14.020 --> 24:16.754
I instructed him to
drink some more fluids,

24:16.823 --> 24:18.622
Plenty of water,
get some nutrition.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.758
<i> Take it easy when</i>
<i> he feels lightheaded,</i>

24:20.827 --> 24:23.294
<i> That we want him to</i>
<i> sit down right away</i>

24:23.296 --> 24:25.763
So that we don't risk him
falling and becoming injured.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.698
-I've got to get to
moving, though.
-[kelsey] yep.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.200
-'cause my feet are
getting freezing cold.
-[kelsey] all right.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.934
Let's move.

24:30.936 --> 24:34.238
[jeremy] <i> it scared me.</i>
<i> I think it's because</i>
<i> I haven't ate nothing.</i>

24:34.307 --> 24:37.041
<i> I'm burning more calories,</i>
<i> more energy.</i>

24:37.109 --> 24:41.712
But, kenny, you said
I'd be home by the end
of the week, old boy.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.948
Guess what? [clicks tongue]
I'm still here.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.516
So you suck it, son.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.118
I'll see you on my 14th day.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.231
[jermaine] I'm bringing
back firewood.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.200
Although I'm feeling
a little better.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.504
No matter what you do,
you get out of the shelter,

25:06.506 --> 25:09.707
That wind's easily 40,
50 miles an hour.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.476
I've been out here three
minutes and I'm freezing.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.512
I'm a tall person.
I'm a big dude.

25:14.514 --> 25:18.516
This pelt, although on
somebody small it would
cover a lot of them,

25:18.518 --> 25:20.518
It's only covering 40%
of my body.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.854
[sarah] yeah.
I can do that next.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.055
[jermaine] let's do that.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.025
I've got my arms,
I've got my legs

25:28.027 --> 25:29.727
I've got to worry about
'cause it's cold.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.229
<i> But there's one more</i>
<i> appendage, a fifth appendag</i>

25:32.231 --> 25:34.131
<i> That I do not want to be col</i>

25:34.133 --> 25:37.334
I'll loose a toe, but I won't
lose the fifth appendage.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.703
Can't lose it.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.706
As long as my butt is covered
it helps a lot.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.642
[sarah] <i> reindeer hides,</i>
<i> they have one of the highes</i>

25:44.743 --> 25:47.111
<i> Insulation values</i>
<i> of any animal hide out there</i>

25:47.113 --> 25:49.280
[jermaine] <i> only thing I'm</i>
<i> worried about is it stays on</i>

25:49.282 --> 25:52.216
Need to improve the situation
for him because I know

25:52.218 --> 25:54.051
He needs to keep his,
uh, groin warm.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.820
Oh, that's going to look nice.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.226
[jermaine] it'll do.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.263
-Yeah?
-Let me grab this part.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.302
<i> He's a big dude</i>
<i> and those reindeer hides</i>

26:11.304 --> 26:14.038
Are not necessarily
the largest around.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.540
-Higher? Okay.
-Yeah, so it sits
atop my hip bone.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.710
-[sarah] there you go.
-[jermaine] yeah.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.680
All better.
Feels like a diaper.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.115
I don't know
if it'll stay on, honestly.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.583
[sarah] it...

26:26.652 --> 26:28.752
[jermaine] <i> I don't really fe</i>
<i> very hilarious at the moment</i>

26:30.923 --> 26:34.124
<i> Have to walk around</i>
<i> like bam bam with</i>
<i> my diaper falling off.</i>

26:35.261 --> 26:37.528
It's kind of
[bleep] up, actually.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.900
Jesus, that's cold.

26:54.714 --> 26:58.549
[waz] they're 15 yards apart.
You stay low, I'll stay high.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.050
Okay.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.952
Just so that we can

27:02.021 --> 27:03.854
Work together we
should be side by side.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.724
And that way if he scares
anything towards me,
I can get it.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.659
If I scare anything
towards him, he can get it.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.229
[waz] jake, there's lots
rabbits scared up around here

27:12.231 --> 27:14.331
So I know they're
gonna be in this area.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.033
[sniffs]

27:19.205 --> 27:20.104
[grunts]

27:21.507 --> 27:23.307
Where is it? Oh, is it...

27:30.016 --> 27:31.148
[waz] oh!

27:31.917 --> 27:33.117
I don't know if I got it.

27:34.654 --> 27:37.054
-Oh, no.
-[jake] must have
just missed it.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.824
Something shot off.
It looked like it was a hare.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.726
Unfortunately we
were unsuccessful.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.362
But it was our first time
so I remain optimistic.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.564
Um, there's rose hips
over here.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.734
They're kind of like
dehydrated, almost.

27:50.836 --> 27:55.239
Like, a little sad, but,
they're a great source
of vitamin c.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.411
They don't taste good.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.713
They just taste
kind of like cardboard.

28:02.715 --> 28:06.950
They still have
some nutritional value
to them, so...

28:07.953 --> 28:10.120
Try to make the most
of what we've got.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.355
Gotta eat.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.458
I get really bitchy
when I'm hungry. [spits]

28:18.664 --> 28:23.100
[sara grunts] by getting
all this between us
and the actual ground,

28:23.102 --> 28:26.637
It'll help us get warmer,
get better sleep.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.406
'cause' we're
more comfortable.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.347
How are you?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.116
Trying to break up branches.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.051
[jake] how'd you go
with that bedding?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.419
[sara] you can look at it.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.620
-[waz] nice.
-[jake] well done.

28:43.622 --> 28:44.721
[sara] okay.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.957
-It's looking good.
-[jake] looks great. Yeah.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.425
So that's completed for now.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.726
[waz] sweet.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.062
[sara] <i> waz and jake are jus</i>
<i> absolutely amazing.</i>

28:52.131 --> 28:54.698
<i> I appreciate them</i>
<i> beyond belief.</i>

28:54.700 --> 28:58.602
Just knowing that they
both believe in me,

28:58.604 --> 28:59.903
<i> It means everything.</i>

28:59.905 --> 29:02.406
[jake] whoa, this is kind of
cozy right here. I like it.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.308
It's nice, under here. Yep.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.681
[waz] judging me for
rolling in my sleep, now.

29:10.683 --> 29:11.815
That's what it's come to?

29:11.817 --> 29:14.251
Sleep, when I'm unconscious
making choices.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.653
You're lucky I don't have
a martini in my hand,
I would throw it at you.

29:16.722 --> 29:17.754
[waz laughs]

29:23.329 --> 29:28.031
I'm covered up
in my nice bison hide here.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.101
Still cold, though.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.804
<i> We all are snuggling</i>
<i> and we're back to back.</i>

29:33.806 --> 29:36.006
<i> I don't think you could get</i>
<i> a stick between us.</i>

29:36.008 --> 29:37.808
<i> We're so cold</i>
<i> and we're shivering, so.</i>

29:37.810 --> 29:38.709
<i> It helped, though.</i>

29:39.612 --> 29:40.744
[waz speaking]

29:41.514 --> 29:43.947
[sara speaking]

29:44.049 --> 29:45.749
-[jake] I'm pretty
happy, guys.
-[sara] I'm happy.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.818
-[waz] I'm really happy too.
-[jake speaking]

30:00.332 --> 30:01.932
[joe] my legs are
already burning.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.805
[sniffles] each of these steps
is friggin' agonizing.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.440
This just sucks.

30:10.509 --> 30:14.244
I can definitely feel
my energy levels going down.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.347
It's just,
the constant shivering.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.284
It's... It really
takes it out of you.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.618
I just...

30:22.521 --> 30:24.254
[big breath, gulps]

30:24.323 --> 30:26.423
I know if I keep going
I'm gonna, gonna be useless.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.025
-Yeah, I hear you. I know.
-[joe] I just need to rest.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.227
[gabby] you got to rest.
Exactly.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.663
Get in there.
The fire's going. Get warm.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.631
[joe] oh, it's so cold.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.940
[ky] is your foot
getting soggy?

30:43.041 --> 30:44.408
[gabby] not at all. Is yours?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.310
[ky] I've gotten through
to the soggy layer now.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.412
[gabby] oh, no.
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:48.414 --> 30:51.114
I always keep an eye
on the sun, where it is
above the mountains,

30:51.116 --> 30:54.818
To know how much time we have
before we have to get warm.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.721
<i> Everything for me in surviva</i>
<i> is risk verses reward,</i>

30:57.723 --> 30:59.623
<i> Calories in verses</i>
<i> calories out.</i>

30:59.625 --> 31:02.826
If I'm going to expend
more calories getting food

31:02.828 --> 31:05.028
Then I'm gonna earn
from that food I'm gonna get,

31:05.030 --> 31:06.830
It's not worth my time.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.100
[gabby] so there's
water in here.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.902
[ky] oh, down
in this little thing?

31:11.904 --> 31:13.604
-[gabby] yeah.
-[ky] is that cress?

31:13.606 --> 31:14.938
[gabby] it is.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.506
<i> We come across watercress.</i>

31:16.508 --> 31:18.108
<i> It's a vegetation</i>
<i> that grows in the water</i>

31:18.110 --> 31:21.612
<i> And is also edible</i>
<i> and relatively good for you</i>

31:21.614 --> 31:24.948
So we threw it in our bag
for later.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.151
Should we go back and have
a watercress soup?

31:28.253 --> 31:29.386
[gabby] let's go try it out.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.722
[ky] my toe's already cold.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.424
And this snow is really
coming in heavy now.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.629
[gabby] oh, that was
a wet spot. Don't step there.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.935
Continuous cold is absolutely
the worst about all this.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.804
I mean...

31:47.806 --> 31:51.842
[sighs] it's just, temperature
is one thing, but the wind
just doesn't quit.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.313
It just... It takes
every little bit
of energy out of you.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.119
You get this chill in you...
You can't get it out.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.023
[clears throat]

32:06.025 --> 32:07.424
[exhales]

32:08.928 --> 32:12.229
I'm really, really struggling
out here already.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.302
[whispering] ow, ow, ow.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.606
[gabby] <i> it feels like there'</i>
<i> ice crystals all around us.</i>

32:22.608 --> 32:26.944
[ky] this is like,
legit cold outside.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.947
[gabby] a little too wet
and too cold to do
anything right now.

32:30.048 --> 32:32.616
[ky] yeah. We have to start
heading back now.

32:37.056 --> 32:40.924
Joe! Is the fire raging?

32:42.161 --> 32:43.160
Joe?

32:44.330 --> 32:46.129
[gabby] joe, you okay?

32:46.131 --> 32:48.932
[ky] whoa. Are you okay?

32:49.802 --> 32:51.301
[gabby speaking]

32:52.104 --> 32:53.303
[ky] joe?

33:00.145 --> 33:01.311
[ky] are you okay?

33:04.516 --> 33:05.816
[gabby] he's passed out.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.220
I'm trying to get
a pulse on him, but...

33:10.222 --> 33:12.122
Whoa. Oh, my goodness.

33:12.725 --> 33:13.724
Joe, are you okay?

33:15.294 --> 33:16.259
Can you hear me?

33:17.363 --> 33:19.229
-[joe speaking]
-[gabby] okay.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.263
[joe speaking]

33:20.265 --> 33:22.332
How long have you,
have you been like this?

33:23.502 --> 33:24.701
[joe speaking]

33:25.637 --> 33:27.137
[ky] do we need
to get the medic?

33:28.207 --> 33:30.207
[joe speaking]

33:36.849 --> 33:38.315
And I've been kind of
here ever since,

33:38.317 --> 33:40.217
Just to kind of recoup
and recover.

33:41.754 --> 33:43.353
[gabby] <i> joe's not</i>
<i> feeling very well.</i>

33:43.455 --> 33:47.157
He is getting cold sweats
and feeling nauseous

33:47.226 --> 33:48.725
And feeling like
he's gonna pass out.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.427
So, obviously
that's concerning.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.630
[joe] so, this has
happened to me before,
it's not uncommon.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.933
Just, it's like I knew
it was coming so I just
had to lay down.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.638
[gabby] joe, we have
watercress out here
if you're hungry.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.508
-[joe] okay.
-All right?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.309
[joe speaking]

34:07.413 --> 34:08.912
So, this is edible.

34:08.914 --> 34:12.783
Um, the only concern
is the water that it's in
could be contaminated.

34:12.785 --> 34:16.486
So, we allowed it to boil
for several minutes, um,

34:16.488 --> 34:20.257
To hopefully knock down
any parasites or bacteria
that might be in the water.

34:28.133 --> 34:31.034
Think it needs some salt.
Not bad, though.

34:31.904 --> 34:32.869
Pudgy.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.504
Yeah, there's some
gritty bits in there.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.006
[both laughing]

34:36.008 --> 34:39.109
I mean, for me there's
something psychologically
rewarding about

34:39.111 --> 34:40.811
Putting something
in my tummy right now, though.

34:40.813 --> 34:43.313
-Like it doesn't
have to be much.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.149
-A couple bites
makes a big difference.
-Yeah.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.786
[ky] let us know
if you need anything, joe.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.621
I'm just trying
to catch my breath.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.357
[ky] well, just relax a while.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.837
[jake] <i> we could definitely</i>
<i> use some food.</i>

35:08.507 --> 35:10.307
<i> I like to take a look</i>
<i> at the creek</i>

35:10.309 --> 35:12.609
And see what we might
be able to do

35:12.611 --> 35:14.411
As far as trout and fishing.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.147
<i> It's a resource that's reall</i>
<i> close to our shelter.</i>

35:17.216 --> 35:19.349
And that would be
a really easy source
of some great proteins.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.055
Seems pretty solid.

35:25.057 --> 35:28.058
<i> Not really the most ideal ti</i>
<i> for catching trout.</i>

35:28.060 --> 35:30.494
A lot of the creek
is covered with ice.

35:30.496 --> 35:35.031
So, just trying to think,
almost like a beaver would.

35:35.033 --> 35:38.435
<i> Possibility of damming</i>
<i> this up, breaking</i>
<i> some of the ice up</i>

35:38.537 --> 35:40.704
<i> To kind of create</i>
<i> a little fishing hole.</i>

35:40.706 --> 35:43.106
Hopefully make it
a little easier to,

35:43.108 --> 35:45.108
To land some trout for dinner.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.610
[narrator] <i> by creating a dam</i>

35:46.612 --> 35:49.246
<i> Trout are unable to swim</i>
<i> and float downstream.</i>

35:49.347 --> 35:52.449
<i> The dammed water pools up,</i>
<i> melting ice</i>

35:52.551 --> 35:54.918
<i> And revealing hiding areas</i>
<i> along the shore.</i>

35:54.920 --> 35:57.254
There are definitely
some hazards.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.289
Right now I'm
on top of the creek,

35:59.291 --> 36:01.424
Just hoping
that it doesn't break.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.628
Um, but I want food
really badly.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.229
Op, there goes my belt.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.505
<i> I put a couple stones down.</i>

36:15.507 --> 36:18.441
<i> I'm gonna go warm up</i>
<i> by the fire for a little bi</i>

36:18.543 --> 36:20.210
And come back down
hopefully with waz.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.012
I'll have double
the horsepower.

36:22.014 --> 36:26.616
Um, and if these have kind of
disappeared by that point,

36:26.618 --> 36:28.952
I know that it's working
and it'll be worth the effort

36:28.954 --> 36:31.421
To, uh, put into
finishing this project.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.701
Oh. So my rocks are gone.

36:44.703 --> 36:48.805
So I put a couple of stones
down here.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.042
So, the water has definitely
started to pool up

36:52.110 --> 36:55.111
Just from that, so I feel like
with a little bit more

36:55.113 --> 36:58.815
Hopefully that'll start
causing the ice to break away.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.350
There's a trout, right there.

37:01.820 --> 37:02.819
-See it?
-[sara] yeah.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.321
-[jake] it's, oh.
-[sara] it's right there.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.225
[jake] <i> seeing a trout</i>
<i> come up into that pool</i>

37:08.227 --> 37:11.328
Just makes every effort
completely worthwhile.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.096
It's kind of right
under the ledge.

37:13.098 --> 37:16.333
I mean, we just basically
throw a [bleep] load
of stuff on it.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.402
Just like the beavers did
in the days of old.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.307
Ready? One, two, three.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.110
[jake] yes! Dammit!

37:27.112 --> 37:31.915
[jake] <i> our plan is to clog</i>
<i> this river up, and create,</i>
<i> like, some extra water,</i>

37:31.917 --> 37:35.719
Get the ice outta there,
and hopefully have
a little better advantage

37:35.721 --> 37:38.421
For, uh, hookin'
ourselves a few trout.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.491
All right, yeah,
that stream is gettin'
deeper by the second.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.627
[waz] <i> my promise</i>
<i> is by the end we're</i>
<i> gonna get a fish.</i>

37:43.629 --> 37:45.528
I want a trout from montana.

[bear grunting]

38:05.217 --> 38:07.517
Jeremy had some
gas last night.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.819
-Oh, boy,
did he have gas.
-He did!

38:09.821 --> 38:12.322
-That is not
an understatement.
-It was like a moose whisper.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.591
-[whooshing]
-[rod] hey, man.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.127
-[trish chuckling] and we're
under this hide, so...
-[moose moaning]

38:18.230 --> 38:20.864
-... So he dutch
ovened us last night.
-Yeah.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.399
Covered wagon, dutch oven...

38:22.401 --> 38:23.800
[trish] we're really bringing
this team together.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.372
[jeremy passing gas]

38:32.944 --> 38:35.412
-[trish] oh, god, going
under the covers.
-[rod] oh! Man.

Lookin' good, rod.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.759
[rod] thank you.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.929

to 'ya, I mean, it's tough.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.454
<i> And we need to try</i>
<i> to get that beaver,</i>

39:17.555 --> 39:20.190
<i> And one of the best ways</i>
<i> to do that is with a trap.</i>

39:20.192 --> 39:22.559
I need to do this for my...
For my team.

39:25.731 --> 39:29.199
-Yeah, I'm glad rod's up.
-[trish] yeah, me, too.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.902
<i> I'm extremely happy</i>
<i> to see him on his feet.</i>

39:32.904 --> 39:36.039
If we get a food win,
that'll boost him up,
and he'll stay.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.808
[jeremy] I'd love to get
a rabbit over a beaver.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.110
-I don't care what it is.
-[jeremy] but I'll
take either.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.413
[rod] there goes that beaver!

39:43.415 --> 39:47.450
We've seen a beaver that's
been coming up and down
the bank over here.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.954
<i> So we're gonna set</i>
<i> a trap up here, dead fall,</i>
<i> that's gonna drop down</i>

39:51.055 --> 39:56.126
<i> When that beaver comes</i>
<i> through to try to get from o</i>
<i> body of water to the next.</i>

39:56.928 --> 39:58.027
<i> We gotta get busy.</i>

40:02.601 --> 40:04.234
<i> It's what you gotta</i>
<i> do for dinner.</i>

40:06.638 --> 40:08.204
<i> Ooh, that wind's cold.</i>

40:12.043 --> 40:15.211
Oh, you get light-headed,
get dizzy.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.520
Oh. [exhaling]

40:25.390 --> 40:26.756
That's what it's gonna do.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.233
This gonna be the hard part.

40:37.235 --> 40:41.004
I gotta put both these logs
on there, and sit this trigger
on there at the same time.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.808
The second log,
all it does is add weight...

40:45.710 --> 40:47.410
... And there goes my trigger.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.144
Ugh.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.119
Ugh, my ribs. Cramp!

41:00.625 --> 41:01.257

I wanted to help
them do the beaver.
[sniffling]

41:22.113 --> 41:23.513

you right here, hot rod.

I didn't have it set
to my mind,

Until I went out there,
and tried to put up the trap,

the trap in for 'ya.

feast over beavertail.

you made your mind up.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.667
I have because of my body.

45:37.669 --> 45:39.468
[jeremy] you know your body,

45:39.470 --> 45:44.807
And if you felt like you done
pushed yourself to that limit
and went a little more,

45:44.876 --> 45:46.709
And you feel it's time,
then it's time.

45:47.512 --> 45:49.812

<i> really tough.</i>

<i> You know, I've... I've</i>
<i> battled, uh, bugs in amazon</i>
<i> and the mosquitos.</i>

46:52.310 --> 46:54.710
<i> I've battled the animals</i>
<i> the animals in africa,</i>

46:54.712 --> 46:58.414
<i> And this has, by far, been</i>
<i> my toughest challenge.</i>

46:58.416 --> 47:00.516
[trish] you know,
you're worth more
than this pelt, right?

47:00.518 --> 47:01.217
[rod] I know.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.686
I love you, guys.

47:04.688 --> 47:05.421
-[trish] love you, rod.

[trish] we'll miss you.

47:06.524 --> 47:07.557
[rod] I'll miss you, too.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.292
<i> It's hard to leave 'em.</i>

47:10.294 --> 47:13.930
<i> But I also don't want</i>

<i> And the consequences</i>

He couldn't take it anymore.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.732
We tried to encourage him,
we tried to push him,

48:22.767 --> 48:25.334
So we... We're gonna
definitely miss rod.

48:25.436 --> 48:29.805
