WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:09.835
BREAKFAST IS SERVED.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.273
WOW. THANK YOU.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.970
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
YOU COOKING.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.493
YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING ALL NIGHT.

00:15.537 --> 00:16.581
YOU GOTTA EAT.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.843
[SIGH] HOW DID
FITZ AND NAOMI

00:17.887 --> 00:19.019
EVEN GET ALL
THIS INFO?

00:19.062 --> 00:20.498
THEY WERE
PRICE'S ASSISTANTS.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.152
GOT PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE GUY.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.501
CLEARLY, THEY PLANNED
A LOT OF THAT

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
DEEP IN ADVANCE.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.809
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.680
HENRY: JACOB SLOAN.
NICKY: MM-HMM.

00:28.724 --> 00:29.942
HOLDING THE MALLET.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.031
THE SAME ONE
HE USED TO RING

00:31.074 --> 00:32.293
THE YUELING BELL BEFORE

00:32.336 --> 00:33.555
THE SAN FRANCISCO
EARTHQUAKE.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.078
TAN WANTED
FITZ'S MANUSCRIPT SO THAT

00:35.122 --> 00:36.645
HE COULD GET
INFORMATION ON THE MALLET.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.168
HE'S GOTTA BE MAKING
SOME KIND OF PLAY FOR IT.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.604
IT COULD BE THE LAST
THING HE NEEDS.

00:39.648 --> 00:42.042
ONCE HE HAS IT,
HE'LL COME STRAIGHT FOR MIA.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.653
FORCE HER TO RING
THE BELL.
THEN WHAT?

00:44.696 --> 00:47.482
BEST GUESS--HE GETS
HIS EARTHQUAKE,

00:47.525 --> 00:49.179
THEN HE USES
THE DESTRUCTION

00:49.223 --> 00:50.615
TO SWEEP INTO THE CITY

00:50.659 --> 00:52.661
AND TAKE EVERYTHING.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.143
WHAT?

00:59.233 --> 01:01.583
MM. REALLY.
THANK YOU.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.846
HENRY: MM-HMM.
NICKY: SORRY.
I KNOW I GET A LITTLE--

01:03.889 --> 01:05.108
NO, I KNOW
HOW YOU GET.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.457
WHEN OUR RESEARCH
IS COMING TOGETHER,

01:06.501 --> 01:07.806
WHEN YOU'RE
AVOIDING SOMETHING.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.548
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA TELL MIA.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.115
WHAT XIAO TOLD YOU
ABOUT HER DESTINY.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.117
I WAS, UNTIL THIS

01:14.161 --> 01:16.424
TROVE FELL INTO OUR LAP.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.034
WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO FIGURING OUT

01:18.078 --> 01:19.731
A NEW WAY
TO STOP TAN.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.907
CAN'T WE JUST RACK UP
A WIN FIRST?

01:21.951 --> 01:25.041
YOU KNOW, SOME
GOOD NEWS WITH THE BAD?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.261
I GET SOFTENING THE BLOW,

01:27.304 --> 01:28.871
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
SO AFRAID OF?

01:30.438 --> 01:33.832
I DON'T KNOW.
HER MOTHER WAS KILLED.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.356
HER FATHER SOLD HER OUT.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.227
SHE'S GOT TAN
COMING AFTER HER.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.708
DROPPING THIS ON MIA
RIGHT NOW COULD

01:39.751 --> 01:40.839
SPIN HER OUT.

01:43.146 --> 01:46.410
I'M STILL GONNA TELL HER.
PROMISE.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.020
OK.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.240
OK. SO.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.155
RUSSELL TAN
NEEDS THE MALLET

01:52.199 --> 01:53.156
TO RING THE BELL.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.201
NATHAN PRICE AND THE

01:54.244 --> 01:55.506
INNER SANCTUM HAVE IT.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.117
EVEN RUSSELL CAN'T
JUST CHARGE IN THERE

01:57.160 --> 01:59.119
AND TAKE IT, SO,
WHAT'S HIS MOVE?

01:59.162 --> 02:02.252
HANG ON.
I SAW AN ARTICLE ONLINE.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.124
I PRINTED IT LAST NIGHT.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.474
THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.259
RUSSELL TAN
AND NATHAN PRICE

02:09.303 --> 02:10.695
HAVE BEEN RIVALS
FOR DECADES,

02:10.739 --> 02:12.523
BUT A FEW WEEKS AGO,
THEY BURIED THE HATCHET

02:12.567 --> 02:14.960
AND ANNOUNCED A JOINT
VENTURE IN CHINA.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.266
WHAT IF TAN
MADE THAT DEAL

02:16.310 --> 02:17.572
TO BUY HIS WAY INTO
THE INNER SANCTUM?

02:17.615 --> 02:19.443
NOW, ACCORDING TO
FITZ'S RESEARCH,

02:19.487 --> 02:20.749
THE MALLET IS LOCKED AWAY

02:20.792 --> 02:21.793
INSIDE OF A VAULT.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.404
IT'S ONLY TAKEN OUT
AND DISPLAYED

02:23.447 --> 02:24.970
DURING THE INNER SANCTUM'S
NEW MEMBER

02:25.014 --> 02:26.581
INITIATION CEREMONIES,

02:26.624 --> 02:28.844
AFTER THE ENCLAVE'S ANNUAL
MASQUERADE GALA.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.674
THAT GALA'S IN 3 DAYS.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
THAT'S HOW TAN'S
GONNA GET THE MALLET.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.938
UNLESS WE GET IT FIRST.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.376
JULIETTE: FATHER, WHY DID
YOU NEED ALL THIS

02:39.420 --> 02:41.204
RESEARCH ON THE ENCLAVE?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.467
WASN'T THAT THE POINT OF
YOUR TRIP TO CHINA?

02:43.511 --> 02:46.166
MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS
TO NATHAN PRICE,

02:46.209 --> 02:48.472
STRIKE A DEAL,
SNAG AN INVITATION

02:48.516 --> 02:50.126
TO JOIN
THE INNER SANCTUM.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.435
AN INVITATION IS NOT
THE SAME AS MEMBERSHIP.

02:54.478 --> 02:57.002
TO BE INITIATED,
ONE NEEDS TO PASS A TRIAL.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.440
THE "RIDDLES OF
THE INNER SANCTUM."

02:59.483 --> 03:00.963
THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THE ANSWERS

03:01.006 --> 03:03.183
IS TO GET IT FROM
A CURRENT MEMBER.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.750
BUT DESPITE MY
EVERY EFFORT,

03:05.794 --> 03:08.144
NOT ONE OF THEM
WILL EVEN CONFIRM

03:08.188 --> 03:09.885
THAT THE TEST EXISTS.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.498
SO, THAT'S WHERE
THE MANUSCRIPT COMES IN.

03:14.542 --> 03:17.806
IT HAS THE ANSWERS
TO PRICE'S RIDDLES.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.678
BUT, FATHER, WHY NOT
JUST MAKE A REPLICA?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.332
THE MALLET IS UNIQUE
AND HAS BEEN

03:22.376 --> 03:23.942
HIDDEN FOR A CENTURY.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.467
WITHOUT EXACT
SPECIFICATIONS...

03:26.510 --> 03:30.384
IT WOULDN'T PRODUCE
THE TONES WE NEED.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.995
FOR OUR PLAN TO SUCCEED,

03:33.038 --> 03:36.216
I NEED
THE ORIGINAL MALLET.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.045
TAN NEEDS THIS MALLET
FOR HIS PLAN

03:40.089 --> 03:42.352
AND WE THINK HE'S USING
THE INITIATION CEREMONY

03:42.396 --> 03:43.658
TO GET IT.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.529
WE WANT
TO BEAT HIM TO THE PUNCH.

03:45.573 --> 03:46.922
BUT IT'S IN
THE INNER SANCTUM,

03:46.965 --> 03:49.664
THE SUPER SECRET PARTY
WITHIN THE PARTY.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.666
NICKY: RIGHT.
RYAN: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAY HERE?

03:51.709 --> 03:52.971
GET IN,
STEAL THE MALLET?

03:53.015 --> 03:54.364
NO, THAT
SOUNDS RISKY.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.713
WON'T THEY REALIZE
IT'S MISSING?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.890
WELL, NOT IF
WE REPLACE IT.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.283
REPLACE IT WITH WHAT?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.677
HENRY: A FAKE.
NICKY: A PERFECT REPLICA.

04:03.721 --> 04:07.116
OK. THAT SOUNDS...
AMBITIOUS.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.074
WE'RE GONNA NEED
AT LEAST 5 TICKETS

04:09.118 --> 04:11.729
TO THE MOST EXCLUSIVE
SOCIAL EVENT OF THE YEAR

04:11.773 --> 04:13.905
AND A REPLICA OF
AN ANCIENT BELL MALLET

04:13.949 --> 04:16.865
SO PERFECT IT COULD
EVEN FOOL TAN.

04:16.908 --> 04:17.953
YEAH.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.130
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
TRICKY, BUT

04:21.173 --> 04:23.915
DENNIS AND I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO SNAG
A PAIR OF TICKETS.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.700
THAT'S GREAT, BUT
WON'T BE ENOUGH.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.919
WE NEED OUR WHOLE
TEAM INSIDE.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.881
AND THE MALLET?
MY ART SKILLS? ZERO.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.578
AND I DON'T THINK
ANY ONE OF US

04:34.622 --> 04:36.232
HAS THE CHOPS TO PULL OFF
THE PERFECT REPLICA.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.538
YEAH. WE DON'T.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.931
TO GET INSIDE,
TO MAKE THIS FAKE,

04:39.975 --> 04:43.587
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO BRING IN SOME
OUTSIDE HELP.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.415
[GASP]

04:45.459 --> 04:46.982
IT'S TIME TO BRING IN
THE BIG GUNS.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.724
NICKY, NO.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.640
YEP. WE'RE GONNA NEED
MAMA AND BABA.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.178
NICKY: WE KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

05:09.221 --> 05:11.311
YEAH. STOPPING AN EARTHQUAKE

05:11.354 --> 05:13.443
IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.532
RUSSELL TAN CAN'T
REALLY DO THAT, CAN HE?

05:15.576 --> 05:17.142
AFTER SOME OF
THE THINGS I'VE SEEN

05:17.186 --> 05:19.144
AND WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT THE 1906 EARTHQUAKE,

05:19.188 --> 05:21.321
IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.802
SO, WHAT YOU NEED ME
TO DO?

05:24.846 --> 05:27.152
WE NEED YOU TO MAKE
A REPLICA.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.458
AFTER WE STEAL
THE REAL MALLET,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.155
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO REPLACE IT,

05:30.199 --> 05:32.114
SO, WHEN TAN STEALS IT,
HE'S GRABBING A DUD.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.334
AND WHEN HE
RINGS THE BELL,
IT WON'T WORK.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.336
NO EARTHQUAKE,
NO DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.163
NICKY: THIS REPLICA
NEEDS TO BE SO GOOD

05:38.207 --> 05:40.078
THAT NO ONE SUSPECTS
IT'S A FAKE.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.950
NOT SECURITY,
NOT THE ENCLAVE,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.692
ESPECIALLY NOT
RUSSELL TAN.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.084
SWEETIE, I DON'T KNOW.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.999
BABA, YOU STUDIED

05:48.043 --> 05:49.653
ART RESTORATION
BEFORE YOU IMMIGRATED.

05:49.697 --> 05:50.872
YOU'RE AN EXPERT.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.264
YEAH, AND THOSE
DOLLHOUSES

05:52.308 --> 05:53.831
YOU USED TO
MAKE ME--MASTERPIECES.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.224
NOT TO MENTION
THE BALSA WOOD CARS

05:55.267 --> 05:56.704
YOU HELPED ME MAKE
FOR SCOUTS.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.140
YOU'VE GOT THE CHOPS.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.011
I HAVEN'T DONE
A REAL ART RESTORATION

06:00.055 --> 06:02.579
FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.407
I NEED TO KNOW THE ERA
THE MALLET'S FROM

06:04.451 --> 06:06.017
AND THE MATERIAL
IT'S MADE FROM.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.584
HENRY IS STUDYING
THE MALLET.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.281
HE'LL TELL YOU ALL
THE INFO YOU NEED.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.979
PLUS, YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO MATERIALS

06:11.022 --> 06:12.284
THROUGH THE ARTS COLLECTIVE.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.898
BABA, WE KNOW YOU CAN
PULL THIS OFF.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.204
MM.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.163
OK. I'LL DO MY BEST.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.557
[SIGH] THANK YOU.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.821
AND YOU TALKED TO MAMA?

06:26.864 --> 06:28.866
SHE'S OK WITH ALL THIS?

06:28.910 --> 06:30.694
NOT YET.
SHE'S NEXT ON THE LIST

06:30.738 --> 06:33.175
AND WE'RE GONNA GET HER
ON BOARD, NO PROBLEM.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.874
ALTHEA: SHE'LL COME THROUGH.
JIN: MM. OK.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.051
SO, UH,
WHAT'S MY ROLE?

06:40.095 --> 06:41.488
WELL, UM, HENRY AND I

06:41.531 --> 06:43.403
NEED TIME IN
THE INNER SANCTUM TO

06:43.446 --> 06:44.708
PICK THE LOCK AND
MAKE THE SWITCH, SO,

06:44.752 --> 06:46.710
WE'LL NEED SOMEONE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.584
SO, I'M THE LOOKOUT?

06:50.627 --> 06:52.150
YEAH. I DON'T LOVE

06:52.194 --> 06:53.195
PUTTING YOU THAT CLOSE
TO TAN,

06:53.238 --> 06:54.675
BUT I KNEW YOU'D INSIST.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.765
EVERYTHING OK?

06:58.722 --> 07:01.421
THERE'S A SIMPLER WAY
TO STOP RUSSELL TAN.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.467
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

07:04.511 --> 07:09.254
YEAH. IT JUST SOUNDS
KIND OF...COMPLICATED.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.692
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
BUT WE GOT THIS.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.130
YEAH.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.484
OK, NICKY, IT'S TIME.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.354
RIGHT.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.617
YOU HAVE TO TELL MAMA.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.054
I AM NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.447
SHE'LL SAY YEAH, RIGHT?

07:27.490 --> 07:29.666
OH, SHE'S GONNA
DEFINITELY SAY NO.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.626
OK. I'M IN.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.760
ALTHEA: OK?
NICKY: REALLY?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.022
YOU SAID
IT WAS IMPORTANT,

07:38.066 --> 07:40.285
THAT IT MATTERS
TO THE WORLD,

07:40.329 --> 07:43.724
THAT IT'S GONNA HELP
PROTECT MIA, SO, I'M IN.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.116
WHAT'S MY JOB?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.988
YOU ARE OUR TICKET
INTO THE EVENT.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.424
I HACKED INTO
THE CALENDAR

07:48.468 --> 07:49.947
OF THE ENCLAVE'S
DIRECTOR OF CUISINE

07:49.991 --> 07:52.210
AND ARRANGED
A "CANCELLATION"

07:52.254 --> 07:53.560
IN ONE OF
HIS CATERERS.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.518
NOW HE'S FIELDING
FOR REPLACEMENTS

07:55.562 --> 07:58.478
AND I SNUCK
HARMONY DUMPLINGS
ONTO HIS LIST.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.480
HE'S COMING IN TOMORROW
TO AUDITION YOUR FOOD.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.177
NICKY: YOU LAND THE GIG...
MEI-LI: AND YOU GUYS

08:02.220 --> 08:03.526
SNEAK IN AS
MY CATERERS.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.267
THE DIRECTOR'S NAME
IS ROY LORENZO

08:05.310 --> 08:07.182
AND HE'LL BE HERE
TOMORROW AT NOON.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.314
ROY LORENZO?

08:09.358 --> 08:11.403
THE ROY LORENZO?

08:14.276 --> 08:15.669
THIS GUY FAMOUS
OR SOMETHING?

08:16.844 --> 08:19.629
BEFORE HE ENTERED
THE BILLIONAIRE
HOSPITALITY CIRCUIT,

08:19.673 --> 08:22.197
ROY LORENZO WAS
A FAMOUS FOOD WRITER.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.155
HIS BOOK ON
FRENCH CUISINE IS LIKE

08:24.199 --> 08:26.375
THE FOODIES' BIBLE.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.551
THIS IS THE FIRST
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BOOK

08:28.595 --> 08:30.379
I BOUGHT WHEN I CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.468
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
COPIES THIS SOLD?

08:34.035 --> 08:35.340
WELL, DON'T LET IT
GET TO YOU, MAMA.

08:35.384 --> 08:36.646
IT'S JUST
ONE BITE OF FOOD.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.518
WHY, YEAH, JUST
ONE PERFECT BITE

08:38.561 --> 08:40.084
FOR THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED PALATE

08:40.128 --> 08:41.521
ON THIS ENTIRE PLANET.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.306
GIVE ME SOME SPACE. PLEASE.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.699
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.483
I AM PLANNING

08:47.527 --> 08:48.832
THE ONE PERFECT BITE.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.011
HENRY: HOW'S IT GOING?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.361
MAN, THIS MALLET
IS BIG.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.885
WE HAVE TO
CONSTRUCT IT IN PIECES

08:57.928 --> 09:00.191
SO WE CAN SNEAK IT
INTO THE EVENT.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.280
ANY IDEAS ON
THE MATERIALS?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.413
WELL, BASED ON
WHEN IT WAS MADE,

09:04.456 --> 09:08.243
MY FIRST GUESS WOULD BE
NAAM MOOK, KIND OF WOOD.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.636
YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.159
HA HA!

09:12.377 --> 09:13.683
WHEN I TOLD MY PARENTS

09:13.727 --> 09:15.511
I WAS GONNA MOVE
TO THE STATES, THEY SAID,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.600
"YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
FIND WORK IN THE ARTS."

09:17.644 --> 09:19.384
YOU KNOW, YOUR DEGREE
WON'T TRANSLATE."

09:19.428 --> 09:21.909
[SPEAKING MANDARIN] HA!

09:21.952 --> 09:23.693
I WAS YOUNG
AND HEADSTRONG.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.913
BUT THEY WERE RIGHT.

09:25.956 --> 09:29.046
WHEN I GOT HERE,
MY DEGREE,

09:29.090 --> 09:31.483
MY CREDENTIALS,
ALL MY EDUCATION,

09:31.527 --> 09:34.051
THEY MEANT NOTHING
IN THIS COUNTRY.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.487
BUT I PUSHED THROUGH.

09:35.531 --> 09:38.447
TRIED TO CONVINCE THEM
I AM QUALIFIED.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.279
THE ONLY WORK I CAN
FIND WERE IN KITCHENS.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.410
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.064
NO. I HAVE NO REGRETS

09:47.108 --> 09:48.631
OF WHERE I ENDED UP.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.721
LET'S BE HONEST,
THIS IS COOL. HA!

09:51.765 --> 09:55.943
TO RECONNECT, TO REDISCOVER
THE OLD PASSIONS. OHH.

09:57.945 --> 10:02.950
HEH. THIS MATERIAL.
WRAPPED AROUND THE HANDLE.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.212
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

10:04.255 --> 10:07.519
IT'S A TYPE OF SILK.
HEUNG WUN SA.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.913
IT'S LABOR-INTENSIVE.
IT'S HARD TO PRODUCE.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.263
VERY FEW ARTISANS
KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.656
IT'S VERY RARE.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.092

MY FATHER MIGHT BE

10:15.136 --> 10:17.007

BLACK TIE, SO, YOU KNOW,

11:44.616 --> 11:46.531
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT. DON'T WORRY.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.059
IT ISN'T ABOUT
THE DRESS, IS IT?

11:52.102 --> 11:56.759
NO, IT'S...
IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.501
THIS PLAN.
I MEAN,

11:59.544 --> 12:01.721
ISN'T THERE AN EASIER WAY?

12:01.764 --> 12:02.896

12:02.939 --> 12:07.770
LIKE...LIKE I JUST
TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.294
HE'S MY PROBLEM.
HE'S AFTER ME.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.079
I COULD JUST DO IT.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.170
DO WHAT?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.519
KILL HIM.

12:19.347 --> 12:23.133
THAT'S...NOT WHAT
WE DO, MIA.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.221
THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.223
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
WHO I AM.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.877
NICKY, I KNOW.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.792
EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN
KEEPING FROM ME.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.621
SUYIN, THE FIRST HYBRID...

12:33.796 --> 12:35.798
THE DESTRUCTION
SHE CAUSED.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.148
WHAT IF THE PROPHECY'S
RIGHT AND

12:38.192 --> 12:39.628
I'M JUST LIKE HER?

12:41.238 --> 12:42.457
A KILLER?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.068
WHO TOLD YOU?

12:46.809 --> 12:49.072
MIA: ZHILAN.
NICKY: WHEN DID YOU TALK TO HER?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.987
DOES IT MATTER?
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

12:51.031 --> 12:52.597
WHO'S TOLD ME THE TRUTH.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.600
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT MY FATE, NICKY?

12:58.647 --> 13:00.562
WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.658
I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU.

13:12.008 --> 13:16.621
I JUST...DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.233
I THOUGHT IF WE COULD
STOP HIM FIRST, THEN...

13:20.756 --> 13:24.455
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.718
IT WAS WRONG
NOT TO TELL YOU.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.677
MIA, I'M SORRY.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.200
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF WHAT

13:30.244 --> 13:32.115
XIAO SAID IS TRUE.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.422
BUT YOU THINK IT IS.
DON'T YOU?

13:37.468 --> 13:40.907
ZHILAN WAS RIGHT.
YOU ARE

13:40.950 --> 13:42.647
AFRAID OF ME,
OF WHAT I'LL BECOME.

13:42.691 --> 13:46.869
I THINK THAT WHAT
YOU BECOME IS UP TO YOU.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.958
JUST BECAUSE THE FIRST
HYBRID LOST HER WAY

13:49.002 --> 13:51.134
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU WILL, TOO.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.484
MY SHIFU ONCE SAID,

13:53.528 --> 13:55.704
"YOU MAKE THE PATH
THAT YOU LIVE."

13:56.879 --> 14:00.317
YOU GET TO DECIDE
WHO YOU ARE, MIA,

14:00.361 --> 14:01.797
WHO YOU WANT TO BECOME.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.234
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

14:04.278 --> 14:06.323
YES. I DO.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.500
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
FIGHTING FOR,

14:09.544 --> 14:11.198
FOR YOU TO HAVE
A REAL FUTURE.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.377
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE...
IS UP TO YOU.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.206
YEAH, I GUESS...

14:20.598 --> 14:22.252
I HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

14:24.385 --> 14:27.344
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
ABOUT SURVIVAL UNTIL NOW.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.085
IT WON'T ALWAYS
BE THAT WAY.

14:32.436 --> 14:37.746
YEAH. WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD GET BACK TO IT.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.967
[SIGH] ALTHEA'S GOTTA HAVE

14:41.010 --> 14:43.186
SOMETHING IN THERE FOR ME.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.976
GONNA BE READY FOR THE PARTY.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.412
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS GET OUR HANDS

14:51.455 --> 14:54.023
ON SOME HEUNG WUN SA FOR
THE HANDLE, WE'RE SET.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.157
HENRY: ABOUT THAT--
MY DAD COULDN'T FIND
ANY LEADS ON THAT.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.898
HE SAYS IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.334
AWW, MAN.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.206
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT WE COULD,

15:03.250 --> 15:05.513
YOU KNOW, FAKE IT?
USE A SIMILAR FABRIC?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.863
OH, THIS SILK
HAS A VERY SPECIFIC

15:07.907 --> 15:09.212
FEEL TO IT.

IF THESE PEOPLE
REVERE THE MALLET

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
AS MUCH AS
YOU SAY THEY DO,

15:12.476 --> 15:14.043
THEY'LL KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.002
SO, WE'RE OUT OF LUCK.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.569
MAYBE NOT.
I KNOW THIS LOCAL FAMILY

15:18.613 --> 15:21.616
WHO HAS SOME
HEUNG WUN SA.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.792
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
AN EASY ASK.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.450
STOP HOVERING.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.496
NICKY, GET THE PLATTER READY.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.585

15:38.763 --> 15:40.330

ABOUT "YOU GOT THIS."

MY FOOD.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.468
IS IT REALLY PERFECT?

15:47.511 --> 15:48.860
I TRIED TELLING HER
NOT TO

15:48.904 --> 15:49.992
REINVENT THE DUMPLING,

15:50.036 --> 15:51.254
BUT SHE INSISTED.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.690
IT'S A VERY
COMPLICATED DISH.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.605
IT'LL BE GREAT.
