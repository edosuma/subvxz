WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:07.805
This is Gates.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.880
Aargh!

00:10.800 --> 00:13.259
What you wanted, it's happening,
now you gotta give me Jackie's body.

00:13.294 --> 00:15.515
What? And ruin our relationship?

00:17.366 --> 00:19.704
It isn't about me
versus you any more.

00:20.868 --> 00:22.271
I'm sorry.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.446
I take pride
in the courage and professionalism

00:27.481 --> 00:29.110
of my counterterrorism officers.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.522
Admit our mistake,

00:33.556 --> 00:36.335
apologise, and get on with the job
of finding the actual terrorists.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.360
Pointing the finger at your own?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.756
Greek Lane's been under investigation
as the scene of a double homicide.

00:42.791 --> 00:45.786
The evidence points very strongly to
these men being involved

00:45.821 --> 00:47.379
in a terrorist operation.

00:47.528 --> 00:50.280
It was Tony,
he was the one that gave the order.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.400
Officer of the year...

00:56.327 --> 00:58.088
- Is something going on between you?
- No.

00:58.415 --> 01:00.836
...Chief Inspector Anthony Gates.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.178
Two identical phones,

01:05.212 --> 01:07.509
don't bother saying there's
an innocent explanation.

01:11.477 --> 01:12.544
I'm AC-12,

01:12.579 --> 01:15.147
call IT now and get them
to unlock this bloody computer!

01:19.160 --> 01:21.125
Now! Talk!

01:24.560 --> 01:26.460
What's wrong with these things?

01:26.495 --> 01:28.360
What d'you know about our business?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.400
Come on, I need this information.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.332
Who have you told?

01:46.367 --> 01:47.760
I don't know anything.

01:47.795 --> 01:49.960
Liar. Idiot!

01:51.831 --> 01:53.749
Get that finger in there.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.520
Oh, these don't work!

01:59.984 --> 02:01.200
I ain't a bloody kid!

02:04.431 --> 02:06.430
Then we do him, like Tommy says.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.999
The police, let's go! Go, go!

02:22.400 --> 02:23.560
Go!

02:26.561 --> 02:28.800
Hey, where you going?
Come here.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.360
You bent bastard!

02:33.421 --> 02:34.166
Argh!

02:34.201 --> 02:36.584
Ah, you bust me leg!

02:37.674 --> 02:38.758
Get down.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.680
And shut up!

02:48.520 --> 02:49.560
Argh!

03:20.160 --> 03:21.189
No...

03:24.848 --> 03:25.979
Please.

04:17.202 --> 04:18.031
Steve?

04:19.202 --> 04:20.320
I'm fine.

04:22.662 --> 04:25.299
- You sure?
- Yeah.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.654
Look, you should go.

04:29.131 --> 04:32.411
It's OK, my cover's blown.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.211
What?

04:35.628 --> 04:37.971
It doesn't matter, I lost Gates.

04:40.563 --> 04:43.051
There's no sign of him here.

04:47.915 --> 04:50.127
Look, I'll follow you to
the hospital, all right?

04:57.442 --> 05:00.286
- Bastard! - Calm down, Ryan,
you'll only hurt yourself.

05:00.571 --> 05:02.731
Where's the water cannon
when you need it?

05:02.766 --> 05:04.891
- Who nicked him?
- DS Arnott said he did.

05:06.279 --> 05:08.051
Who arrested you, Ryan?

05:08.693 --> 05:10.491
DC Fleming asked you a question,
Ryan.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.732
I ain't saying nothing
without a solicitor!

05:43.551 --> 05:44.991
Jools?

05:47.566 --> 05:49.385
Jools, are you here?

05:52.791 --> 05:54.231
Jools!

06:15.071 --> 06:16.311
Jools!

06:42.726 --> 06:44.591
It's OK, boy.

06:50.099 --> 06:51.553
It's OK.

07:08.754 --> 07:11.556
Shhh, boy. Shh.

07:11.983 --> 07:15.311
It's OK, Sam, it's OK, big man.

07:33.111 --> 07:35.916
- Oh, Tony?
- Are the girls at school?

07:35.951 --> 07:37.246
- What are you doing here?
- The girls, Jools.

07:37.281 --> 07:40.180
- Yeah, of course they are.
- OK, I need you to pack a couple of bags,

07:40.215 --> 07:42.731
pick them up early
and then take them to your mum's.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.477
What's going on?

07:43.512 --> 07:46.222
Listen, I'll pack the bags myself if
I have to, but we have to get going.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.951
- Tony, talk to me!
- They killed Sammy!

07:49.404 --> 07:51.043
Oh, my God.

07:52.967 --> 07:57.596
Yeah. Don't. It's a warning.
It's me they're after.

07:57.631 --> 08:00.073
- Who are these people?
- It doesn't matter who they are,

08:00.074 --> 08:02.260
I just need to know that
you and the girls are safe,

08:02.295 --> 08:03.647
that's all I care about right now.

08:03.665 --> 08:05.297
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you.

08:05.332 --> 08:07.014
Jools, you'll be safe at your mum's.

08:07.049 --> 08:08.697
This is ridiculous,
you're the police!

08:09.388 --> 08:12.867
- I'm calling 999.
- Hey! Listen! I am on my own.

08:12.902 --> 08:14.391
No, you're not!

08:14.426 --> 08:17.460
This mess, it's mine. It's not yours
and it's not the girls'.

08:17.495 --> 08:19.507
I just need you to do what I say.

08:19.704 --> 08:20.904
- I'm calling Nigel.
- Don't.

08:21.355 --> 08:22.420
There's not a bloke at the station

08:22.455 --> 08:24.580
- that won't stand by you.
- Jools, stop it!

08:24.615 --> 08:27.788
- Why are you behaving like this?
- This is about Jackie, all right?,

08:27.823 --> 08:29.762
and the people that she
was in business with.

08:29.797 --> 08:32.027
What are you saying?
That they killed Sammy?

08:32.063 --> 08:34.260
- Yeah. - Well, what's it
got to do with Jackie?

08:35.018 --> 08:36.806
They killed her, too.

08:38.624 --> 08:41.950
- My God. When?
- A couple of weeks back.

08:43.654 --> 08:44.419
Why didn't you say anything?

08:44.454 --> 08:47.407
Because I thought I'd...
I was trying to fix everything.

08:47.442 --> 08:48.498
How?

08:48.533 --> 08:52.202
- What's going on? - It doesn't matter,
all right?, they're criminals.

08:52.237 --> 08:55.871
Now, I need you to pack those bags
and I need you to pick up my girls.

08:55.906 --> 08:56.750
Why are you shutting me out?

08:56.785 --> 08:59.555
Because I need to be able to
handle this on my own.

09:00.471 --> 09:02.551
I'm not going anywhere without you.

09:08.271 --> 09:11.031
I was fucking her.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.753
OK?

09:13.351 --> 09:15.871
I was fucking Jackie.

10:11.451 --> 10:12.931
Steve.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.415
You all right?

10:18.851 --> 10:21.571
You're OK.
They operated on your hand.

10:21.606 --> 10:23.628
They saved your finger.

10:23.663 --> 10:25.651
Yeah, I'll call you back.

10:25.686 --> 10:27.651
Hey, Steve.

10:30.039 --> 10:31.073
Any sign of Gates?

10:31.829 --> 10:34.777
No. The house is deserted.

10:34.891 --> 10:39.611
DI Buckells' team have put a trace
on his phone but it's switched off.

10:39.646 --> 10:41.891
Right.

10:43.211 --> 10:45.851
We'll take a statement when you're
feeling a bit better.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.252
Since Gates went AWOL
just before it happened,

10:49.287 --> 10:51.326
we're assuming
he was involved in some capacity.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.038
Quite a set of charges, isn't it,
for the Officer of the Year -

10:55.811 --> 10:58.548
conspiracy, kidnapping, GBH,

10:58.583 --> 11:00.998
- attempted murder.
- I'm not sure he was involved, sir.

11:04.718 --> 11:07.547
We haven't got the evidence yet,
you mean.

11:08.290 --> 11:12.571
But we will get it.
Kate, we should debrief.

11:13.735 --> 11:14.719
Kate.

11:19.491 --> 11:22.291
All right, Kate, I'll see you
back at the office, yeah?

11:23.931 --> 11:27.851
- I'm glad you're feeling better,
Steve. - Thank you, sir.

11:33.171 --> 11:34.296
What's that about?

11:34.331 --> 11:35.738
Well, now my cover's blown,

11:35.773 --> 11:38.364
it's a question of
whether I'll stay on the case.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.731
Do you want to carry on?

11:42.851 --> 11:44.451
I think you know the answer.

11:45.775 --> 11:49.256
The men who were holding you got
away, but the kid's in custody.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.657
We won't be able to interview him until
we've tracked down a responsible adult.

11:52.811 --> 11:53.874
OK.

11:58.372 --> 12:00.120
I heard you trashed Gates' office.

12:01.756 --> 12:02.680
Yeah.

12:10.091 --> 12:11.816
There was a freezer,

12:11.851 --> 12:13.931
in the place they held me.

12:15.491 --> 12:17.211
Struck me as odd.

12:18.211 --> 12:21.971
- We found traces of blood on the
floor, around the freezer. - Cheers.

12:25.451 --> 12:26.891
Hiya.

12:26.892 --> 12:27.892
There are traces of body fluids,

12:28.851 --> 12:31.856
seepage from before a body
was frozen.

12:31.891 --> 12:34.291
I don't think the seepage products
will tell us much.

12:34.326 --> 12:36.528
Tells us they moved it in a hurry.

12:36.563 --> 12:38.696
Yeah, because they didn't clean up.

12:38.731 --> 12:42.131
I'm surprised you've not been
pulled out, DC Fleming.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.331
I say Fleming. Who knows?

12:46.811 --> 12:50.851
The chances are her body's in
another freezer somewhere else.

12:50.886 --> 12:52.576
It'll be Jackie all right.

12:52.611 --> 12:55.291
They'll preserve the body
as evidence against Gates.

12:55.326 --> 12:56.811
He didn't kill her.

12:56.846 --> 12:58.976
No?

12:59.011 --> 13:00.198
I'm not sure he's capable.

13:15.785 --> 13:18.408
- I'll come with you.
- No. I'm all right.

13:26.411 --> 13:28.931
- Kate.
- Dot.

13:31.371 --> 13:32.609
I've just come to get my stuff.

13:33.173 --> 13:34.713
No hard feelings.

13:49.091 --> 13:52.291
Deserved it, didn't she, eh?

13:59.091 --> 14:01.366
Her cover isn't the only thing
she blew, you know?

14:01.735 --> 14:03.376
Ask Tony.

14:13.164 --> 14:14.068
Here.

14:14.103 --> 14:14.973
Thanks.

14:18.251 --> 14:20.131
Which force are you really from?

14:26.771 --> 14:28.082
Who was your target then, eh?

14:28.754 --> 14:30.406
Just Gates?

14:32.675 --> 14:34.545
I can't discuss my brief.

14:36.331 --> 14:38.451
You must be pretty
pissed off though, eh,

14:38.486 --> 14:40.291
not getting the evidence you needed.

14:40.326 --> 14:42.176
- I got plenty.
- Yeah?

14:42.211 --> 14:44.851
I don't see Tony Gates
in custody. Do you?

14:52.731 --> 14:55.493
The last time I saw Gates,
he was talking with Morton.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.598
If anyone's still loyal, it's him.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.111
What?

15:02.931 --> 15:04.731
Leave Morton to me.

15:20.051 --> 15:21.106
Here we go again.

15:21.318 --> 15:22.386
Has Gates called you yet?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.188
He knows there'll be
a trace on his phone.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.327
He'll find a way.
When he calls, give him a message.

15:27.362 --> 15:30.432
The subway between Borogrove
Estate and Moss Heath Park.

15:30.467 --> 15:33.443
tell him I'll be there,
alone, at midnight.

15:33.478 --> 15:35.416
You must think I'm
thick as pig shit.

15:35.451 --> 15:38.451
You don't know the situation
between me and Gates, but he does.

15:40.151 --> 15:41.958
What if I say, "screw you"?

15:42.130 --> 15:44.109
The only person you'd be screwing
is your best mate.

15:56.626 --> 15:59.304
Virtually all my detectives have
been seconded to the operation.

15:59.339 --> 16:01.319
You've responded decisively, sir.

16:09.138 --> 16:10.605
You two know each other?

16:11.251 --> 16:13.331
What you doing here?

16:14.065 --> 16:17.258
Chief Inspector Osborne is
contributing his expertise

16:17.293 --> 16:19.975
- to our counter terrorism operation.
- You believe this?

16:20.010 --> 16:22.657
The Greek Lane cell appeared exactly
the same time as ours

16:22.692 --> 16:24.479
dropped off the radar.

16:24.745 --> 16:26.606
We can't exclude
a direct connection.

16:26.689 --> 16:29.451
If you'll excuse us, DS Arnott.

16:30.871 --> 16:31.973
I'm sorry about that, Philip.

16:33.051 --> 16:36.851
Ah, DS Cottan,
our Acting Deputy SIO. CI Osborne.

16:36.886 --> 16:39.291
- Cottan.
- Very pleased to meet you, sir.

16:42.089 --> 16:45.718
- Morning. - Hiya, I'm
Ryan Pilkington's social worker.

16:45.886 --> 16:46.716
Just a minute.

16:46.761 --> 16:49.451
Hi. Sorry. DC Fleming.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.142
Will you come with me, please?

16:51.731 --> 16:53.211
Thanks.

17:45.971 --> 17:49.216
Interview under caution with
Ryan Pilkington

17:49.251 --> 17:52.211
by Detective Constable Fleming in
the presence of Ryan's solicitor.

17:52.246 --> 17:56.256
- Louise Burton. - Social worker.
- Jane Hargreaves.

17:56.291 --> 17:59.491
Community Liaison Officer,
Community Juvenile Liaison Officer

17:59.526 --> 18:03.131
and Community Policing Case File
Officer, PC Bannerjee.

18:06.571 --> 18:09.131
I know things aren't
great for you at home, Ryan.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.131
We've had to give up
on your mum.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.336
She won't come in.

18:12.371 --> 18:14.851
She'd rather leave all this
to your case workers.

18:15.312 --> 18:16.875
How d'you feel about that?

18:18.891 --> 18:21.336
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

18:21.371 --> 18:22.234
You'll do anything to be
out of the house.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.195
You don't care what it gets
you into.

18:28.331 --> 18:30.291
You're right.
Our lives doesn't compare

18:30.326 --> 18:31.816
but I do want to help you, Ryan.

18:31.851 --> 18:35.496
You're on a bad road
and you need to get off it.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.291
Tell me what you know about the men
who were holding DS Arnott.

18:40.411 --> 18:43.891
We know the same men were
involved in a series of incidents.

18:44.448 --> 18:46.466
Two men were killed in Greek Lane.

18:46.501 --> 18:50.616
A drug dealer named Wesley Duke was
hung from a lamp post.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.931
And a woman named Jackie Laverty was
snatched from her own home.

18:55.754 --> 18:57.776
Four murders, Ryan.

18:57.811 --> 19:00.991
- I need to know you had nothing
to do with them. - I didn't.

19:01.026 --> 19:04.171
And I believe you, Ryan.
But you know about them, don't you?

19:04.206 --> 19:06.802
My client denies any knowledge
of these offences.

19:06.837 --> 19:08.032
But the person
who ordered those murders

19:08.067 --> 19:11.551
- is someone you work for, though,
isn't that right? - I dunno.

19:12.554 --> 19:15.331
Don't lie to me, Ryan.
I can't help you if you do.

19:16.331 --> 19:19.336
You were involved in holding
and torturing DS Arnott.

19:19.371 --> 19:22.331
You spoke to a man on the phone who
was giving you the orders.

19:22.366 --> 19:24.281
- Who's that man?
- I dunno.

19:24.316 --> 19:26.197
Well, does he have a name?

19:27.051 --> 19:29.776
- Ryan's answered the question,
DC Fleming. - Ryan.

19:29.811 --> 19:33.411
- I don't know his name.
- Does he use the name "Tommy"?

19:34.451 --> 19:35.389
Dunno.

19:36.177 --> 19:38.419
That's the name DS Arnott heard.

19:38.649 --> 19:40.170
Let's call him Tommy.

19:40.331 --> 19:41.510
Whatever.

19:42.531 --> 19:44.851
What do you do for Tommy, Ryan?

19:44.886 --> 19:46.091
Don't do nothing.

19:49.811 --> 19:51.811
For the tape,
I'm showing Ryan a mobile phone,

19:51.846 --> 19:54.616
evidence number G67389.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.691
- Is that your phone?
- No.

19:57.691 --> 20:00.131
Well, it was recovered
from the location where you were

20:00.166 --> 20:01.691
holding DS Arnott.

20:06.131 --> 20:09.171
You're a tough kid, Ryan.
Or at least you think you are.

20:10.571 --> 20:12.491
Where did you get those injuries?

20:15.501 --> 20:17.056
If you carry on like this,
the place you're going has

20:17.091 --> 20:20.531
16-year-olds, 17-year-olds,
and they're built like brick sheds.

20:20.566 --> 20:23.611
How d'you think you'll
fare against one of those lads?

20:25.731 --> 20:27.218
They knock your teeth out, Ryan.

20:27.253 --> 20:29.169
They do that so you give
a better blow job.

20:29.204 --> 20:31.531
I don't think that's very helpful,
DC Fleming.

20:33.491 --> 20:34.896
It AIN'T my phone!

20:34.931 --> 20:37.191
But you recognise it, don't you?

20:37.226 --> 20:39.058
No comment.

20:39.093 --> 20:40.891
What d'you do for Tommy, Ryan?

20:40.926 --> 20:43.136
No comment.

20:43.171 --> 20:45.976
Four murders, Ryan. This is serious.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.451
I know you're innocent.
You were just helping out with
the phones, weren't you?

20:49.486 --> 20:53.456
Just did the phones.

20:53.491 --> 20:55.776
- Did what exactly?
- Nick phones for 'em.

20:55.811 --> 20:58.291
For the lot of 'em.
They'd use 'em for a couple of days.

20:58.326 --> 20:59.576
Then I'd get rid of 'em.

20:59.611 --> 21:02.251
Right, so you needed unregistered
phones, like this one.

21:02.286 --> 21:03.731
That's it. The phones.

21:06.091 --> 21:08.971
My client has been very helpful.
Can we leave it there, please?

21:09.006 --> 21:10.896
Have you ever met Tommy?

21:10.931 --> 21:12.435
No, he does it all on the phones.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.905
Did he ever ask you to do anything

21:13.940 --> 21:17.252
in relation to the woman I
mentioned earlier, Jackie Laverty?

21:17.287 --> 21:18.696
Like what?

21:18.731 --> 21:20.497
Well, we're still looking for
her body, Ryan.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.452
- Where is it?
- I dunno.

21:23.851 --> 21:25.531
Are you sure, Ryan?

21:25.566 --> 21:27.291
Yeah.

21:29.451 --> 21:30.896
We can protect you from Tommy.

21:30.931 --> 21:33.131
- Yeah, right!
- Where's the body, Ryan?!

21:33.166 --> 21:35.331
- DC Fleming, please.
- That's enough.

21:40.371 --> 21:44.651
There's a police officer, Ryan.
Detective Chief Inspector Gates.

21:44.686 --> 21:45.771
Do you know who I mean?

21:47.451 --> 21:48.816
Well, let's assume you do.

21:48.851 --> 21:52.051
Did Tommy ever give you instructions
regarding DCI Gates?

21:55.744 --> 21:56.376
Ryan!

21:56.411 --> 21:59.656
I'd give him a phone.
Tommy does all the talking.

21:59.691 --> 22:02.651
- My client's already admitted...
- What did he say to Gates?

22:02.686 --> 22:04.451
- What did Gates say to him?
- I can't remember.

22:04.610 --> 22:06.341
Think carefully, please, Ryan.

22:06.771 --> 22:08.696
Did Tommy and DCI Gates ever

22:08.731 --> 22:11.551
- discuss kidnapping DS Arnott?
- I dunno.

22:11.586 --> 22:14.371
Ryan's answered
your questions, DC Fleming.

22:14.406 --> 22:16.331
He's tired. Are you tired, Ryan?

22:17.331 --> 22:19.631
Ryan? Please.

22:19.666 --> 22:21.931
Think carefully.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.951
Did DCI Gates help kidnap DS Arnott?

22:26.986 --> 22:29.851
No, he was the one who rescued him!

22:38.531 --> 22:41.851
Well, thank you, Ryan.
We'll leave it there for now.

22:41.886 --> 22:43.027
I hope you're being looked after

22:43.062 --> 22:45.313
if there's anything you need,
just let me know.

22:47.131 --> 22:49.011
DS Arnott.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.056
What the hell's going on here,
Fleming?

22:54.091 --> 22:57.231
We got a responsible adult
but you were busy.

22:57.266 --> 23:00.371
You're off TO-20.
You were never bloody on it.

23:00.406 --> 23:02.131
Right you are, sir.

23:06.331 --> 23:07.776
Ryan, sorry,

23:08.373 --> 23:10.841
I'm Detective Inspector Buckells.

23:10.876 --> 23:12.091
Can I have a Big Mac now?

23:18.911 --> 23:20.671
Kate. Wait!

23:21.871 --> 23:23.191
I knew something was going on!

23:23.226 --> 23:24.512
When were you going to tell me?

23:25.039 --> 23:26.078
I'm sorry.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.081
What? And now you "owe" him?

23:28.515 --> 23:29.739
Gates played us. All of us.

23:29.774 --> 23:31.528
- And he's at it again.
- He saved my life!

23:31.563 --> 23:33.283
He put you in danger
in the first place!

23:33.318 --> 23:34.511
He was backed into a corner.

23:35.031 --> 23:36.645
Yeah, that we put him in,
to crack the case!

23:36.680 --> 23:38.553
You're close to Gates
and you don't understand him.

23:40.511 --> 23:43.740
You know what, you're screwing up an
operation I've spent months on Steve,

23:43.775 --> 23:44.836
undercover,
worrying about my every move,

23:44.871 --> 23:48.831
bricking it in case I get caught,
sleepless nights?

23:49.699 --> 23:50.716
Cheers, mate.

23:50.751 --> 23:52.791
Thanks a fucking million!

25:15.031 --> 25:16.381
Who else knows you're here?

25:16.791 --> 25:18.391
No one. Now, where's Gates?

25:18.426 --> 25:19.551
Arggh!

25:27.915 --> 25:29.141
Pillock!

25:59.671 --> 26:02.111
Wh...?! Aargh!

26:11.071 --> 26:12.236
Gates?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.356
What the hell's going on?

26:14.391 --> 26:17.711
I need to flush out any back-up,
make them come running.

26:17.746 --> 26:19.511
There's no back-up, it's just me.

26:19.546 --> 26:20.344
Yeah?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.333
So, you're looking after your own,

26:21.368 --> 26:23.300
that's not in the
Anticorruption Code, mate.

26:23.711 --> 26:25.311
Well, it's mine.

26:28.471 --> 26:30.716
I was never on the take.

26:30.751 --> 26:33.356
And I was never in with criminals,
that was all Jackie.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.946
You pulled surveillance off Greek
Lane so they could do the murder.

26:35.981 --> 26:37.418
I never gave that order.

26:37.591 --> 26:39.836
Anyone tells you different is lying.

26:39.871 --> 26:42.135
All the dirty money Jackie funnelled,
you never suspected a thing?

26:42.170 --> 26:43.460
Listen, I was an idiot.

26:43.591 --> 26:45.082
And I never twigged who
she was in with.

26:45.117 --> 26:47.463
But it was them who
did the murder, not me,

26:47.498 --> 26:49.810
and it's them I'm
hiding from, not you.

26:52.471 --> 26:53.626
Turn yourself in.

26:54.179 --> 26:56.259
Give evidence against them.
We can protect you.

26:56.671 --> 26:58.476
That's a bunch of crap
and you know it.

26:58.511 --> 27:01.311
I'm a dead man walking.
And so are you, son.

27:01.346 --> 27:03.516
We need to get them
before they get us.

27:03.551 --> 27:06.751
For Jackie's murder, for the
Greek Lane mob, and for Wesley Duke.

27:06.786 --> 27:09.031
Because they're the real criminals,
Arnott. Not me.

27:09.066 --> 27:10.511
What the hell am I supposed to do?

27:10.546 --> 27:11.255
Just back off.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.970
You back off and you keep everybody
else off of me until the job's done.

27:15.045 --> 27:17.476
How do I know this isn't
just another one of your games?

27:17.511 --> 27:20.631
This is my only chance of holding on to
any of the things I give a toss about.

27:20.666 --> 27:22.820
I'll give you Tommy,
and then you let me go.

27:23.112 --> 27:23.869
You got it?

27:24.751 --> 27:26.151
- Arnott? Have you got it?!
- Yes!

27:54.616 --> 27:56.796
- Er, Matthew.
- Sir.

27:56.831 --> 27:59.348
CI Osborne's joined us
on semi-permanent secondment.

27:59.383 --> 28:01.865
I'd be grateful if you could be
his point of contact.

28:01.866 --> 28:03.008
I'd be very happy to, sir.

28:03.451 --> 28:04.509
I've been impressed, Matthew,

28:04.544 --> 28:07.724
I wonder how do you feel about
sitting the inspector's exam?

28:09.351 --> 28:10.956
I don't know what to say, sir.

28:10.991 --> 28:16.631
No-one wants to step into dead man's
shoes, but Tony Gates is finished.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.236
I meant to ask, what brought
you into the service, Matthew?

28:22.271 --> 28:25.711
Well, where I grew up, sir, there wasn't
much respect for law and order.

28:25.746 --> 28:28.096
You know, I could've
fallen in with a bad crowd.

28:28.709 --> 28:32.151
But instead, I made a few quid
caddying at the local golf club.

28:33.261 --> 28:35.836
I met a bloke there, sir,
who opened my eyes.

28:35.871 --> 28:40.151
Well, think of this as an opportunity
to help young people like that.

28:42.234 --> 28:44.831
- I want it, sir.
- Good man. Excellent.

28:57.311 --> 29:00.791
The police are here,
get out, quick! Go on, go!

29:03.591 --> 29:05.051
Go on, go!

29:09.951 --> 29:11.556
Must've seen the vehicle.

29:11.591 --> 29:15.031
Remind me to check outstanding
warrants back at the station.

29:15.066 --> 29:17.711
Is that your mum's boyfriend, Ryan?

29:29.751 --> 29:32.231
You better have fed him.

29:36.591 --> 29:39.151
Right,
let's get round to the chippy.

29:41.151 --> 29:43.671
Just give me a minute, Kaz.

29:53.231 --> 29:54.556
What now?

29:54.591 --> 29:58.831
Ryan, I er,
I want you to know you can call me.

29:58.866 --> 30:00.236
I ain't no grass.

30:00.271 --> 30:03.831
Yeah, I know, it's just if there's
stuff you want to talk about.

30:03.866 --> 30:07.031
Or you want someone to buy you
a burger. That's all.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.299
OK.

30:08.750 --> 30:09.922
Promise?

30:23.791 --> 30:26.231
Right, I'll have a cod and chips.
See you there.

30:26.266 --> 30:28.396
Simon, what?

30:28.431 --> 30:31.311
I know, this is the Bog,
we never leave the vehicle.

30:37.791 --> 30:39.791
Hi.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.311
Steve, fancy a cup of tea?

30:53.311 --> 30:54.711
Ha, shall I be mother?

30:55.791 --> 30:56.561
Thank you, sir.

30:57.242 --> 31:00.626
You know the date came through
for your inquest. It's next week.

31:00.661 --> 31:01.104
Right.

31:01.139 --> 31:05.064
Yeah, suppose you could always argue
that you're not fit to testify?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.351
Yeah?

31:07.591 --> 31:08.631
Kate?

31:09.973 --> 31:12.085
The news came through yesterday but
I decided to let it wait.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.062
There's no point ruining
a good night's sleep.

31:13.097 --> 31:16.224
- Did you sleep all right last night?
- Good, thank you, sir.

31:16.259 --> 31:19.351
Yeah, I know, you know,
I mean with the arm and all that.

31:19.386 --> 31:20.756
Just a quiet night in, sir.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.991
Quiet night?
You cheeky wee shite, ya!

31:23.026 --> 31:25.356
Kate, you have a word with him.

31:25.391 --> 31:27.391
My doctor told me
to watch me blood pressure.

31:31.511 --> 31:35.151
The boss put an officer
on your flat. For your protection.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.951
He saw you stumble in
well after midnight.

31:39.271 --> 31:40.556
I had a meeting with Gates.

31:40.591 --> 31:43.711
Jesus Christ, Steve!
You're meant to be my partner.

31:43.746 --> 31:45.596
Well, you were never
Gates's partner, then?

31:45.631 --> 31:49.031
- What the hell are you talking about?
- If this is personal... - "Personal"?

31:49.066 --> 31:51.871
- If something happened between you two...
- Like what?

31:51.906 --> 31:52.903
Nothing. Forget it.

31:52.999 --> 31:53.689
What d'you want to know?

31:53.991 --> 31:56.351
- I shouldn't have asked.
It's private. - Yeah, it is.

31:57.312 --> 31:58.287
Here.

31:59.471 --> 32:01.311
Now that you and Gates
are bosom buddies,

32:01.346 --> 32:02.916
you'll know what to do with that.

32:02.951 --> 32:04.789
- A wire tap?
- Yes, Steven, a wire tap.

32:04.944 --> 32:06.844
What is it with you?

32:06.845 --> 32:07.845
You think you owe Gates?

32:08.351 --> 32:10.831
Why don't you ask yourself who
you REALLY owe?

33:01.231 --> 33:04.114
Yeah, yeah, I would, yeah.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.007
Yeah.

33:08.347 --> 33:09.436
Just a second, sorry.

33:09.471 --> 33:12.431
You got a minute, sir?
We're eager for an update.

33:14.631 --> 33:16.916
The body fluids
recovered from the freezer match

33:16.951 --> 33:19.396
the blood from Jackie Laverty's
house. I re-interviewed

33:19.431 --> 33:22.991
the ASBO Dodger, but he's never
gonna grass where they moved the body.

33:23.026 --> 33:24.394
Now we're looking at the phone data.

33:24.534 --> 33:26.218
When do you make the tissue match?

33:26.391 --> 33:28.991
Oh, were you not on
the distribution list?

33:29.026 --> 33:31.236
I do apologise.

33:31.271 --> 33:33.311
Sorry, Alex, carry on.

33:33.346 --> 33:34.431
Sir.

33:35.671 --> 33:39.191
So do we know how long the cell has
been operating under cover as drug dealers?

33:39.226 --> 33:43.151
Yeah, well, we interviewed a known
dealer, Wesley Duke, before he died.

33:43.186 --> 33:44.636
He reckoned, a month, sir.

33:44.671 --> 33:46.911
Jermaine Duke, brother of
the deceased, says Wesley remarked

33:46.946 --> 33:49.380
on the reliability from
the Greek Lane suppliers.

33:49.415 --> 33:51.732
They were organised.
Not smackheads.

33:51.767 --> 33:52.614
Professionals.

33:52.649 --> 33:55.855
Fits with them having a supply line
running directly from Northern Pakistan.

33:57.631 --> 33:59.356
Oh, don't mind me.

33:59.391 --> 34:01.831
A supply line running directly
from Northern Pakistan?

34:01.866 --> 34:04.591
Makes a change from nicking
chavs on Moss Heath.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.908
You must be creaming yourselves.

34:06.943 --> 34:09.191
This is a private meeting, Arnott.

34:09.226 --> 34:12.271
Fine. I'll wait.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.311
Excuse me.

34:23.090 --> 34:23.869
Come on.

34:29.945 --> 34:31.791
Right, you've got 30 seconds.

34:34.110 --> 34:35.414
I'd like to explore the possibility

34:35.449 --> 34:37.162
the Greek Lane residents
weren't terrorists.

34:37.630 --> 34:40.356
Naturally, I'm open to
all possibilities.

34:40.391 --> 34:43.950
I've been conducting an in-depth
operation against DCI Tony Gates.

34:43.985 --> 34:46.208
And at no point
in Gates's investigation did

34:46.242 --> 34:48.396
he ever develop
a lead into a terror connection.

34:48.430 --> 34:52.510
Not until he obtained evidence
of the bomb-making activity.

34:52.546 --> 34:55.396
Sir, it was household bleach
and a chemistry book.

34:55.430 --> 34:58.916
Those lads were making crack,
not IEDs. And Gates knows that.

34:58.951 --> 35:02.351
He only dressed it up as a CT op when
he realised we were about to crucify him.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.396
Is that it?

35:08.431 --> 35:09.911
Thanks, Arnott, time's up.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.499
Don't act like this
hasn't happened before.

35:13.020 --> 35:15.551
Our operation was botched.
And you're trying to cover it up.

35:15.586 --> 35:17.751
The only person not telling
the truth is you.

35:17.786 --> 35:19.516
You're out on a limb, Arnott.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.945
Not a great place to be
when the inquest opens next week.

35:22.148 --> 35:23.125
No wonder you're desperate.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.275
You asked me to lie, sir,
to go along with it.

35:26.310 --> 35:29.391
At least have the common decency
to admit that.

35:29.426 --> 35:31.796
I did no such thing.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.596
I got shafted because of you!

35:33.631 --> 35:36.351
Because I won't cover up our blokes
busting into the wrong flat,

35:36.386 --> 35:37.831
shooting an innocent person.

35:37.866 --> 35:39.551
See you at the inquest.

35:59.351 --> 36:02.111
This isn't going to work.
I can't use this on Gates.

36:02.146 --> 36:04.991
- Steve. You're off the case. Just...
- Wait!

36:08.351 --> 36:09.871
There's a bigger crime here.

36:10.991 --> 36:14.951
Gates believes he can bring in a high-value
offender within organised crime.

36:14.986 --> 36:17.956
- What? He told you that?
- He's desperate.

36:17.991 --> 36:19.890
He believes it's his only chance
to save his career,

36:20.306 --> 36:21.720
his reputation, his family.

36:22.231 --> 36:24.836
Look, DI Buckells' team's been
checking phone records, right?

36:24.871 --> 36:27.376
I can feed the information to Gates.
He has a relationship with this people.

36:27.411 --> 36:29.281
They'll want to meet,
if only to kill him.

36:29.316 --> 36:31.116
Gates can pick up
an unregistered phone

36:31.151 --> 36:33.412
so he can make contact without being
traced by Buckells now I...

36:33.447 --> 36:34.542
Whoah, whoah! Hang on a second.

36:34.577 --> 36:36.665
What are you saying?
You're going to cut this guy loose?

36:37.791 --> 36:40.436
After all this, the only way I'm
going to sanction an operation

36:40.471 --> 36:43.081
like this, son, is if you can promise me
that you're going to deliver Gates

36:43.116 --> 36:45.871
right into the palm of my hand.

36:55.911 --> 36:57.925
This is the call history
from Ryan's phone.

36:58.751 --> 37:01.631
It goes back only a couple of days,
from when the handset was stolen.

37:01.666 --> 37:03.431
Now, there's a pattern
of incoming calls,

37:03.466 --> 37:04.876
always from different numbers.

37:04.911 --> 37:09.191
Having lost Ryan,
there's a big chance right now Tommy

37:09.226 --> 37:11.271
doesn't know
which of his numbers is secure.

37:11.306 --> 37:13.196
All the numbers are
currently inactive.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.511
Hastings is on standby to move
as soon as one joins the network.

37:18.431 --> 37:19.751
So are we.

37:52.951 --> 37:54.036
You're not coming in.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.191
I can't be seen
out here on the doorstep.

37:57.226 --> 38:00.116
Hey, please, Jools.

38:00.151 --> 38:01.869
I'm doing everything
to make us good again.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.637
I promise you, I'm doing everything.

38:04.751 --> 38:06.511
But work are calling me back in.

38:07.671 --> 38:09.236
Are my girls in there?

38:09.271 --> 38:11.631
I don't want you upsetting them.

38:13.911 --> 38:15.836
Just an hour.

38:15.871 --> 38:17.591
Just so it's like we're
a family again.

38:17.626 --> 38:18.871
Just an hour, please?

38:20.191 --> 38:21.916
Please.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.391
What's the time, Mr Wolf?

38:23.426 --> 38:24.791
Three o'clock.

38:28.711 --> 38:30.551
What's the time, Mr Wolf?

38:30.586 --> 38:31.871
Ten o'clock.

38:35.191 --> 38:36.511
What's the time, Mr Wolf?

38:36.546 --> 38:37.848
Dinner time!

38:40.871 --> 38:42.551
DC Fleming.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.861
One of the numbers from
Ryan's phone just got activated.

38:47.896 --> 38:49.115
They're triangulating now.

38:49.311 --> 38:51.111
Yeah, good, off you go,
both of you, go on.

38:51.146 --> 38:52.366
Yes, standing by.

38:52.759 --> 38:54.788
Positions, everybody, come on.

39:03.352 --> 39:04.486
Go on, then.

39:08.551 --> 39:10.191
What's the time, Mister Wolf?

39:19.249 --> 39:20.031
Yeah?

39:20.779 --> 39:21.975
It's on.

39:25.511 --> 39:27.791
Gates?

39:29.431 --> 39:30.831
Received.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.309
Guys?

39:45.831 --> 39:48.131
- I'm going to have to go.
- Why?

39:48.166 --> 39:50.431
I have got to go back to work.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.076
Have they got the triangulation yet?

40:08.111 --> 40:10.631
They've got a signal
in the Kingsgate, heading west

40:10.666 --> 40:13.348
towards Edge Park.
It's got to be Tommy.

40:13.383 --> 40:16.031
En route.
We've got a signal in Kingsgate.

40:16.066 --> 40:18.648
Heading west towards Edge Park.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.231
This is Gates. I'm a minute away.

40:21.266 --> 40:23.196
What are we?

40:23.231 --> 40:25.876
- Two. Shit.
- What?

40:25.911 --> 40:28.311
I don't trust him, OK?
I don't bloody trust him!

40:30.711 --> 40:34.471
Tommy's travelling very fast.
Now going west on Kingsgate Road.

40:34.506 --> 40:36.751
Kingsgate Road, west.

40:36.786 --> 40:37.871
Received.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.194
He's already jumped
to the next cell.

40:50.654 --> 40:52.145
He's going like the clappers.

40:54.391 --> 40:56.511
God knows how,
but he must be on to us.

40:56.546 --> 40:58.276
Gates. Bastard!

40:58.311 --> 41:00.556
Tracking Tommy, 9301...

41:00.591 --> 41:04.111
He's just taken a left,
Edge Park Road, southbound.

41:05.551 --> 41:07.236
Drop him. This is our op.

41:07.271 --> 41:09.791
Drop him and he's gone. So's Tommy.

41:09.826 --> 41:12.191
Left turn. Edge Park Road.

41:12.226 --> 41:13.871
Received.

41:23.911 --> 41:25.911
The target's just
turned west again.

41:30.311 --> 41:32.271
He's leading us round
the bloody houses!

41:35.551 --> 41:37.836
We're now southbound
on Edge Park Road.

41:37.871 --> 41:41.031
Target is now heading west.
Look for a right turn ahead.

41:49.571 --> 41:52.656
Tracking Gates. 93016,
macro cell...

41:52.691 --> 41:56.651
He's stationary.
About 200 yards from the turn.

42:01.891 --> 42:04.691
He's gone off road.
200 yards from the turn.

42:10.771 --> 42:13.891
He's reached wherever he's going.
Or he's dumped the phone.

42:33.091 --> 42:35.376
MAN: Cutting it fine, Tom!
- Sorry.

42:35.411 --> 42:37.951
Just move it.
Can you get me a trolley handle?

42:37.986 --> 42:40.491
And a Kit-Kat?
Or a Mars bar, or something?

42:42.731 --> 42:45.131
Yeah... You cheeky bugger!

42:51.051 --> 42:52.278
Gates, report.

42:53.178 --> 42:55.214
Where are you,
what's happening?

42:56.331 --> 42:57.411
Gates!

42:59.451 --> 43:00.931
Gates!

43:09.291 --> 43:12.291
After the hammering you took last
week, we thought you'd be a no-show.

43:12.326 --> 43:14.771
Ha ha. I'll win my money back.

43:16.811 --> 43:19.531
Oh, right, thank you. Good on you.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.291
What's your problem, mate?

43:36.131 --> 43:39.531
It's all right, we're fine.

43:41.251 --> 43:43.571
Let's go out onto the tee.

43:50.451 --> 43:52.331
What?

43:53.571 --> 43:55.051
That's for my kids' dog.

43:57.286 --> 43:59.006
Back off! Now.

43:59.417 --> 44:00.464
Go.

44:05.531 --> 44:06.731
Let's go.

44:08.051 --> 44:10.371
Right turn, coming up.

44:13.291 --> 44:14.971
Move! Move!

44:43.491 --> 44:45.971
Now visual, in pursuit.

44:47.131 --> 44:50.371
Look, where are you taking me?

44:54.816 --> 44:56.713
D'you want to know the longest
anyone's ever managed to

44:56.748 --> 44:58.724
hold me in a police station?

45:00.331 --> 45:01.915
I'm not arresting you.

45:03.349 --> 45:05.692
I didn't kill Jackie Laverty.

45:07.731 --> 45:11.251
The only evidence they'll
find on her is from you,

45:11.286 --> 45:13.296
you and your dirty business,

45:13.331 --> 45:18.051
plus the knife with your prints
all over it.

45:19.411 --> 45:22.451
When I was with her,
she was still alive.

45:22.486 --> 45:24.128
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.

45:24.163 --> 45:25.736
No but your boys were, weren't they?

45:25.771 --> 45:28.851
And did they make her suffer?
Did they have their fun with her?

45:30.051 --> 45:33.171
You've got a dirty mind.
My boys are professionals.

45:33.206 --> 45:34.278
Bullshit.

45:34.448 --> 45:37.053
Probably under orders not
to tamper with the evidence.

45:38.571 --> 45:40.576
What orders would those be?

45:40.611 --> 45:43.851
Listen, you used her
to get to me, didn't you?

45:45.571 --> 45:47.456
It's an interesting story, eh?

45:47.491 --> 45:52.491
Unfortunately, I'm not in a
position to either confirm or deny.

45:53.691 --> 45:55.631
Oh, Christ.

46:01.371 --> 46:03.753
Listen, she was my girlfriend
and I cared about her.

46:04.611 --> 46:06.651
I just want to know what
you did to her.

46:06.686 --> 46:08.931
Spare yourself.

46:10.251 --> 46:12.571
Your life's
miserable enough already.

46:12.606 --> 46:14.126
Oh, you bloody didn't.

46:14.161 --> 46:16.394
You did Greek Lane
and you did Wesley Duke.

46:16.429 --> 46:19.540
My squad is starting to put it
together right now.

46:19.571 --> 46:21.096
And every piece of evidence,

46:21.131 --> 46:24.011
every piece is starting to
point towards you.

46:28.162 --> 46:29.136
What evidence?

46:29.171 --> 46:31.131
Well, there's me for a start.

46:33.331 --> 46:36.571
A copper inside
is bad and bad enough.

46:36.606 --> 46:39.811
But you'll be a copper that grassed.

46:41.211 --> 46:43.131
That's why I want to stay out.

46:44.604 --> 46:46.311
I want that more than anything.

46:48.273 --> 46:50.588
What is this evidence
you're talking about?

46:50.740 --> 46:52.103
Oh, we're going to get to that.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.771
First, I want to make things
straight between me and you.

47:00.453 --> 47:04.157
Well, there has to be
something in it for me.

47:04.211 --> 47:08.291
The kid. Ryan.
He's young enough to turn.

47:11.691 --> 47:13.896
No one's daft enough to grass on me.

47:13.931 --> 47:17.371
Anticorruption can't make a case
against me without informants.

47:17.406 --> 47:20.051
What with that DS you gave us?

47:23.371 --> 47:25.536
You mean Arnott?

47:25.571 --> 47:29.731
I've fixed him.
I fixed him my way.

47:32.531 --> 47:36.931
I couldn't be a part of killing him,
but all the rest is fine.

47:36.966 --> 47:39.138
Listen, I can still be of use to you.

47:40.055 --> 47:42.493
- You're dreaming.
- Am I?

47:42.528 --> 47:45.136
I dressed up
Greek Lane as something else.

47:45.171 --> 47:47.411
And I'm gonna make
Wesley Duke's murder look like

47:47.446 --> 47:49.336
a tear-up between some
low-level dealers.

47:49.371 --> 47:53.491
So if Jackie's body's never found,
then there's no case to answer.

47:53.526 --> 47:55.237
For either of us.

47:55.272 --> 47:56.948
He's played us again!

47:57.518 --> 47:58.469
I'm calling in back-up.

47:58.504 --> 48:00.598
- Let's get the pair of them
while we can. - No. Wait.

48:00.633 --> 48:01.990
- Steve!
- Wait.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.531
The only problem is the fingers.

48:09.731 --> 48:12.491
- I don't know what you're
talking about. - Drop the act.

48:12.526 --> 48:15.251
The amputated fingers are the only
link between Wesley Duke

48:15.286 --> 48:16.536
and Greek Lane.

48:16.571 --> 48:20.251
It was clumsy and ignorant. You
said your boys are professionals.

48:20.286 --> 48:22.771
That means it was
your bloody stupid idea.

48:22.806 --> 48:24.261
They got carried away.

48:24.786 --> 48:26.396
Bloody idiots.

48:26.431 --> 48:28.611
Come on, Gates, nail the bastard.

48:31.691 --> 48:34.520
So I make Wesley Duke's murder
look like a copycat.

48:35.011 --> 48:39.131
But there's no forensics,
so they are gonna need a confession.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.400
Your boys screwed up,

48:40.885 --> 48:42.692
make one of them cop for it.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.448
Triple murder
hanging round your neck.

48:48.742 --> 48:50.113
And I need a decision.

48:50.251 --> 48:52.541
I know the toe rag
that'll take the fall.

48:52.576 --> 48:55.582
- He's gonna need to know chapter
and verse. - He will.

48:55.771 --> 48:58.171
Tommy, I am risking
my neck for you here,

48:58.206 --> 49:00.331
I'm gonna need more than that, mate.

49:01.371 --> 49:02.854
He was there.

49:02.855 --> 49:03.855
He did it.

49:05.851 --> 49:08.271
I can't carry this off
if he's a nut job.

49:08.306 --> 49:10.656
He'd better be able to
take orders.

49:10.691 --> 49:12.771
- He will if I give 'em.
- Hey stop pissing me around.

49:12.806 --> 49:13.621
I need a simple answer,

49:13.656 --> 49:16.031
to a simple question and
we're running out of time.

49:16.066 --> 49:18.039
For fuck's sake!

49:18.040 --> 49:21.447
He killed him, on my orders.

49:21.571 --> 49:23.211
Good enough for you?!

49:23.246 --> 49:24.451
Yes!

49:28.371 --> 49:29.742
Good,

49:32.322 --> 49:34.206
so what d'you want in return?

49:34.491 --> 49:36.793
I want Jackie's body up in smoke.

49:36.828 --> 49:39.095
Problem is, she's my leverage.

49:39.412 --> 49:41.888
How about this as Plan A?

49:42.331 --> 49:46.571
You do as you're told and
if you ever choose to not play ball,

49:46.606 --> 49:50.811
my boys unload Jackie's body
and you go down for her murder.

49:53.771 --> 49:54.614
Now,

49:55.247 --> 49:58.244
turn this thing around,
there's a good lad.

49:58.279 --> 49:59.891
I can still make the second tee.

50:04.851 --> 50:08.691
I said, turn it around!

50:08.726 --> 50:10.651
You bent bastard.

50:11.890 --> 50:13.842
Yeah, you heard me.

50:13.843 --> 50:15.517
You bent bastard.

50:21.211 --> 50:22.752
What's happening?
What are they doing?

50:22.932 --> 50:24.456
Gates.

50:25.064 --> 50:26.558
There's no way out for him.

50:27.931 --> 50:31.371
You're under arrest for the
double murder at Greek Lane.

50:31.406 --> 50:33.496
For the murder of Wesley Duke.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.687
For the murder of Jacqueline Laverty

50:35.722 --> 50:38.296
and you do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

50:38.331 --> 50:41.891
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

50:41.926 --> 50:45.104
And anything that you do say may
be given in evidence.

50:53.811 --> 50:55.891
I'll hold him.
Back-up's seconds away.

50:57.251 --> 50:58.771
Just go. Run.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.291
Run where?

51:02.091 --> 51:05.096
It's over. We got him.

51:05.131 --> 51:09.811
My wife and my girls get nothing
unless this is in the line of duty.

51:11.371 --> 51:16.131
That's what you owe me.
This and nothing else.

51:16.166 --> 51:18.008
Do you understand?

51:18.043 --> 51:19.851
It's for my family.

51:21.011 --> 51:22.816
I was never bent.

51:22.851 --> 51:25.491
You know that, don't ya?

51:33.491 --> 51:34.421
Gates!

51:35.114 --> 51:36.064
Gates!

52:36.171 --> 52:37.591
As you were.

52:40.451 --> 52:42.247
How'd it happen?

52:45.971 --> 52:49.689
DCI Gates was running through
traffic to apprehend the suspect.

52:50.491 --> 52:52.221
Line of duty, sir.

53:01.171 --> 53:02.731
I should inform his wife.

53:02.766 --> 53:03.983
Thank you, sir.

53:09.611 --> 53:12.752
Well done, you two.

53:12.964 --> 53:14.342
Well done.

53:14.860 --> 53:16.264
Thank you, sir.

53:16.411 --> 53:18.040
Thank you, sir.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.755
Sir, do you mind
if I get a minute with him?

53:52.790 --> 53:54.536
Just a couple of things
that might help us

53:54.571 --> 53:57.671
with the Greek Lane op,
non-evidential, obviously.

53:57.706 --> 53:58.848
Yeah, no problem.

53:59.771 --> 54:02.531
I hear you won't be calling me
Sir for much longer.

54:02.566 --> 54:04.011
Congratulations, Dot.

54:04.046 --> 54:05.496
Thanks.

54:05.531 --> 54:09.371
DS Cottan. Do you mind if I use the
back of your van for a minute?

54:09.406 --> 54:11.211
This way please, sir.

54:24.611 --> 54:28.291
I hope you've got some good
advice on how to play this hole.

54:29.611 --> 54:30.764
Well, the top brass think

54:30.799 --> 54:33.317
the Greek Lane lads were
involved with Al-Qaeda.

54:35.131 --> 54:39.451
So you just play along with it,
in return for immunity.

54:41.451 --> 54:43.371
Huh.

54:45.771 --> 54:47.331
Huh.

54:49.531 --> 54:51.691
Best caddy I've ever had, son.

55:00.571 --> 55:02.091
I owe you a pint, Sir.

56:00.211 --> 56:02.411
Hello.

57:07.491 --> 57:09.651
I swear to tell the truth,

57:11.171 --> 57:13.131
the whole truth,

57:14.811 --> 57:16.731
and nothing but the truth.
