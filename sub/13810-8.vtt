Kids:
OH, MAN.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.976
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:28.060 --> 20:30.312
I KNEW THE NETHERWORLD
WOULDN'T DO THIS TO ME.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.856

GOING ON HERE?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.358

20:47.913 --> 20:49.122
{\an1}HEY, GUYS.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.750

SCAREDY-CATS OF OCEAN SHORES.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.043
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.505
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
OF THE MONSTER?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.548
GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, LARS.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.803

PRANK IN THE HISTORY
OF OCEAN SHORES.

21:02.886 --> 21:03.512
IT WAS?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.347

21:05.430 --> 21:07.683
{\an1}I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO SCARED.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.601
I THOUGHT YOU TWERPS
WOULD BE MAD.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.352
NAH, WE CAN
TAKE A JOKE.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.187

NO PROBLEM, KIDS--
WE'RE ALWAYS GLAD

22:28.889 --> 22:30.766
