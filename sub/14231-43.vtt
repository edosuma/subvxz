10:53.695 --> 10:56.990
You're going about this all wrong.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.827
Pete, you know, winning this contest
isn't everything.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.079
Oh, [sttamers]
but it is everything and more!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.832
Why, it's my destiny!

11:05.915 --> 11:07.500
You gotta help me, Peg.
Please, you got to help me.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.962
You got to help me.
Please, please, please don't make me beg.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.547
You are begging.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.799
Well, then don't make me beg
any more than I have to.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.970
Well, all right, but it won't be easy.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.847
You'll have to do what I tell you,

11:20.930 --> 11:23.266
how I tell you, and when I tell you.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.893
I will, oh, I will.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.479
I'm putty in yer domesticatin' hands.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.899
Ha ha. I think I'm going to enjoy this.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.735
[blows whistle]

11:33.818 --> 11:35.862
All right, listen up! Let's do it.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.573
We're fast approaching
zero hour to judgment day,

11:38.656 --> 11:40.408
and there's still work to be done.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.993
Do you read?

11:42.077 --> 11:44.996
Yes, sir-- ma'am-- sir-- madam-- person.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.874
There's chores to be done,
errands to be run,

11:47.957 --> 11:49.084
and we've only just begun!

11:50.919 --> 11:52.420
[Pete] Dog groomed, laundry cleaned,

11:52.504 --> 11:54.464
car waxed, groceries brought.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.718
[Pistol] Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! I've got rights!

11:58.802 --> 12:00.303
I'm a citizen!

12:04.391 --> 12:06.726
What in the name of breck shampoo--

12:06.810 --> 12:09.062
All right, everybody freeze!

12:09.646 --> 12:11.439
What do you think yer doing?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.608
Just playin', Daddykins,

12:13.692 --> 12:15.944
like kids our age play,

12:16.027 --> 12:18.530
so if you don't mind...

12:19.531 --> 12:22.617
This place looks like a disaster
hit by a tornado in a war zone!

12:22.701 --> 12:24.285
And the judges will be here in...

12:24.369 --> 12:26.538
Aah! Twenty-five seconds!

12:26.621 --> 12:28.373
All right. Straighten the furniture!

12:28.456 --> 12:30.041
Pick up the toys! Go! Go! Go!

12:30.125 --> 12:33.628
Oh! Ha ha. Where have you been? [chuckle]

12:33.712 --> 12:35.338
Me? Where were you

12:35.422 --> 12:37.090
while my perfectly clean house

12:37.173 --> 12:39.342
was being turned into a total mess?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.136
This isn't a mess.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.596
Wait till you see
the kitchen. That's a mess.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.597
This is nothing.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.729
-[doorbell rings]
-[gasp]

12:50.812 --> 12:52.647
P.J., pistol, come here.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.399
You two keep tidyin' up, see?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.109
I'll take care of everything.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.278
And make sure you be quiet about it

12:58.361 --> 13:01.990
because Daddy's gotta impress the judges.
Ha ha ha.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.452
Well, hello there. Come in.

13:05.535 --> 13:10.540
And let me say what a truly profound
honor it is to--

13:10.623 --> 13:13.501
Please, sir.
Save the butter for your popcorn.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.420
Let's just begin, shall we?

13:15.503 --> 13:18.840
Simple, clean, neat, average.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.091
Average?

13:30.060 --> 13:33.521
Ma'am, it really is a pleasure to make--

13:33.605 --> 13:35.690
Excuse me! Comin' through!
Move it to one side!

13:35.774 --> 13:37.400
Hot water! Watch your backs!

13:37.484 --> 13:40.236
Sir, child labor is not
encouraged in the home.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.073
You are the helper, not your children.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.158
No! Oh, she wants to help!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.243
I-- I can't talk her out of it.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.789
Yeah. The wife says it's because
I set such a good example,

13:50.872 --> 13:53.166
you know, inspiratin' her the way I do.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.543
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, where's
that 50 you promised me if--

13:55.627 --> 13:56.628
[muffled]

13:56.711 --> 13:58.755
Ha ha! She means, uh,

13:58.838 --> 14:01.049
fifty big, fat smooches on the cheek

14:01.132 --> 14:02.759
for Daddy's little girl.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.678
Smooch, smooch, smooch,
smooch, smooch, smooch.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.846
Ha ha. Ain't she cute? Ha ha ha!

14:08.223 --> 14:10.141
I most certainly do not mean

14:10.225 --> 14:11.309
big, fat smooches.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.144
I mean big, fat dollar bills,

14:13.228 --> 14:14.562
so you better cough it up right now,

14:14.646 --> 14:16.815
or I'm gonna-- whoop!

14:16.898 --> 14:20.276
You should study your neighbor Mr. Goofy.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.986
He manages his household

14:22.070 --> 14:26.157
without infringing upon his child's
formative years.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.411
But you haven't seen my lustrous linoleum

14:29.494 --> 14:30.995
or my codfish casserole!

14:31.079 --> 14:34.165
Or this coupon for 10% off
on your next RVpurchase!

14:34.249 --> 14:36.960
Mr. Goofy. Goofy, Goofy, Goofy.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.337
I'll never beat that goof fair and square,

14:39.421 --> 14:42.841
but victory hasn't slipped
through my wits yet.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.885
It's time for a little drastical action--

14:46.011 --> 14:49.931
Something simple, clean, neat.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.433
I'll cheat.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.936
Gotta get my beauty sleep,

14:55.061 --> 14:58.398
else I'm gonna have luggage under my eyes.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.152
Now for a little creative
performance enhancement,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.904
also known as sabotage.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.704
I'm gonna really fix that goof's wagon.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.622
Aah!

15:14.706 --> 15:16.374
[crash]

15:16.458 --> 15:19.627
Sounds like creepy crawly
creatures in the garage again.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.380
Good thing I put out my extra-big trap.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.632

-[Pete] Yeow!

15:25.091 --> 15:25.967

Guess that did the trick. Ah-hyuck!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.722
[yawns]

15:32.640 --> 15:35.602
I'm gonna beat that goof no matter what.

15:35.685 --> 15:39.105
Scam the torpedoes! Full greed ahead!

15:40.482 --> 15:41.858
[applause]

15:41.941 --> 15:43.610
[man] Thank you. Thank you.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.238
Well, good evening,
ladles and tablespoons.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.742
Just a little household
humor there. Ha ha.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.995
Welcome to the Mrs. SpoonervilleSociety's

15:54.079 --> 15:55.497
Househelper contest.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.623
Thank you.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.085
Please put your hands together
for our special contestants--

16:00.460 --> 16:01.461

16:10.387 --> 16:13.098
Mr. Butler, Cook, and Shein.

16:14.933 --> 16:18.269
Hmm...sounds like a law firm.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.854
Or a cleanin' staff.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.482
Now, then, our first event

16:22.565 --> 16:25.902
is the ancient househelper art
of serving tea.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.115
[Pete] look at that, would you?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.742
No style, no form, no flourish.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.286
It's guys like him give
tea servin' a bad name.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.624
Pardonnez-moi, madame.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.584
A little something to catch yer drool.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.379
Oh, puh-lease!

16:44.504 --> 16:45.505
Aah!

16:47.424 --> 16:50.844
Nice and warm, like a baby's bath water.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.976
For you, pookens.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.022
[both] Aah!

17:02.147 --> 17:05.358
Out! Off! Gone!

17:05.483 --> 17:08.820
I do not like the way this is goin'.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.241
[humming]

17:13.366 --> 17:16.494
It's going to start
goin' better any minute now.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.912
Ha ha ha!

17:18.038 --> 17:19.956
Whoa! Whaah!

17:24.461 --> 17:25.545

Oh, very clever.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.263
Mmm. Delightful.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.850

17:38.933 --> 17:40.727

17:40.852 --> 17:44.522
I'm talkin' about floor polishing!

Give ya a hand there, Goofer?

17:55.992 --> 17:58.411

is already underway, folks,

as our contestants cook a specialty.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.477
Oh, that's delightful.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.981
[both] Mmm! Mmm!

18:27.273 --> 18:30.819

Whoa, nellie!

19:06.730 --> 19:08.565

And we'll be right back after these words

19:10.942 --> 19:14.738
ffrom our sponsor-- Nipsy Wipsy Cat Food.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.533
I've gotta do somethin'

19:18.616 --> 19:20.535
to eliminate a little competition.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.209
Hey, pal, you just won Mr. Congeniality.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.086

19:50.523 --> 19:53.651
And I can beat him
with one ham behind my back.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.737
Uh, it seems three of our contestants

19:55.820 --> 19:57.405
have left the building,
thank you very much,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.574
thereby forfeiting their chance to win.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.327
But we'll just carry on
with our two remaining entrants

20:02.452 --> 20:05.205

the muffin bake-off.
