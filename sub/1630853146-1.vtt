WEBVTT

01:10.070 --> 01:13.373
Hi, I'm Walt and this is
my official application

01:13.440 --> 01:17.277
for the Kovi Industries
Student Mars Program.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.879
Not that the last 36
applications weren't official,

01:19.946 --> 01:21.748
it's just this is
my final one.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.652
because they are actually
making me graduate
after this semester,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.420
so... Okay.

01:27.487 --> 01:31.658
<i>I was raised by a single mom.</i>
<i>She had, like, 100 careers.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:34.794
<i>We moved around like crazy,</i>
<i>so I never really had</i>
<i>a home base.</i>

01:34.894 --> 01:37.163
<i>But one time</i>
<i>when I was, like, six,</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:39.466
<i>she took me to see</i>
<i>this solar eclipse</i>

01:39.566 --> 01:42.802
and from that moment on
all I wanted to do
was go to the Sun.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.773
And I know that you can't
actually go to the Sun.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.644
My mom would try to tell me
that, but I would
just stare at it.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.513
Uh, and I was obsessed.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.015
<i>Because there was more</i>
<i>out there than the new town,</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:59.119
<i>or the new school which always</i>
<i>felt like the same town</i>
<i>and the same school</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:00.854
and I think if I could've
gotten the chance to just

02:00.954 --> 02:04.157
go up there and look back
I would've seen...

02:05.925 --> 02:10.096
where I fit in,
in this crazy universe.

02:10.163 --> 02:14.767
<i>Exploration is the way</i>
<i>that we discover where</i>
<i>we truly belong</i>

02:14.834 --> 02:19.372
and I just...
I don't belong here.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.209
Which is all to say
that I think I would be
a perfect fit

02:23.309 --> 02:27.547
for the Geological Survey Team,
or Propulsions Analysis
Department.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.117
Botany and Terraformation Crew,
Security Detail, Rover Repair.

02:31.184 --> 02:35.121
Look, if you need someone
to make you coffees,
I'm your guy.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.126
I am your guy.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.131
That's it.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.467
Um... Okay.

02:47.534 --> 02:48.835
Well, with any luck,

02:48.902 --> 02:51.070
the next time you see me

02:51.171 --> 02:54.007
uh, I will be on Mars.

02:58.745 --> 03:02.048
<i> Let's face it.</i>
<i>This planet isn't</i>
<i>cutting it anymore.</i>

03:02.148 --> 03:05.018
<i>I'm self-made billionaire,</i>
<i>Leon Kovi</i>

03:05.084 --> 03:08.188
<i>and I cannot wait</i>
<i>to meet you on Mars.</i>

03:09.522 --> 03:13.159
Walt! Oat milk latte.
Light foam.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.028
Oat milk latte. Light foam.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.997
This obsession with Mars
is borderline unhealthy

03:18.064 --> 03:21.167
and you are on the wrong side
of that border.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.402
Exactly.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.370
Should I fire you,
so you can go there?

03:24.437 --> 03:28.708
Let's do it, Walt.
I'll fire you.
It truly would be my pleasure.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.010
No, Gary. I love it here.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.545
Maybe tomorrow.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.348
- Oat milk latte?
- Light... foam?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.420
- Gary?
- Yes, Walt?

03:40.520 --> 03:41.788
Did she just smile at me?

03:41.888 --> 03:45.124
Honestly, I'd say
she smiled past you.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.594
- Analysis.
- There is a 52% chance

03:47.694 --> 03:49.362
of romantic interest.

03:49.429 --> 03:53.399
But a 48% chance she pities you
due to your low status position

03:53.466 --> 03:55.034
as an assistant barista

03:55.101 --> 03:58.037
to a robot
on a university campus.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.539
Shall I continue?

04:15.755 --> 04:18.124
I honestly feel like I'm gonna
get accepted this time.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.959
You're projecting.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.895
So what?

04:22.962 --> 04:26.266
Leon Kovi was 25 when he became
the very first man
to set foot on Mars.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.167
And here we are, just settling

04:28.268 --> 04:31.671
for the same classes and jobs
and parties that our parents
went to,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.741
and their parents went to
before them and their parents
went to before them--

04:34.807 --> 04:36.342
So you're not coming to
the party?

04:36.442 --> 04:38.344
- Of course,
I'm coming to the party.
- Great. Come on.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.346
- You're carrying the booze.
- No, come on.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.415
- We're gonna forget about it
and I'm gonna take it to work.
- Walt,

04:42.482 --> 04:44.450
I'm gonna need you to
keep the whole

04:44.517 --> 04:46.286
Walt-ing thing
in check tonight.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.087
- "Walt-ing"?
- Bummer monologues.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.957
- Leon Kovi hero worship.
- It's not hero worship.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.696
- That came with
the application packet.
- Not the frame.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.266
Don't you wanna be
part of something special?

05:02.268 --> 05:04.337
Walt.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.306
You're not special.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.374
I'm not special.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.643
Most people, not special.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.979
Listen, someday,
you're gonna meet someone

05:13.046 --> 05:15.148
and make something special
with them.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.382
Like a memory.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.851
Or a weird, well, baby thing.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.821
But until then,

05:21.888 --> 05:25.658
drink this and for the love
of God do not bring up Mars.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.027
- This place is nuts.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.629
Do you live here?

05:29.696 --> 05:31.631
Oh, no. Some trust fund girl.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.736
You know, when I was little,
I had this fantasy
that my mom--

05:36.836 --> 05:38.705
Ooh, let's not.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.239
Yeah.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.176
Bathroom?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.515
It's beautiful.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.250
Hi, Sophie.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.885
Okay, show me yours.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.487
<i> Hi, Calvin.</i>

05:54.554 --> 05:56.422
<i>Hi, human Sophie.</i>

05:56.522 --> 05:58.591
<i>Nine months.</i>

05:58.691 --> 06:01.828
<i>Nine months until</i>
<i>my parents' contract is up</i>

06:01.894 --> 06:03.863
<i>and we return to Earth.</i>

06:03.930 --> 06:07.400
<i>Nine more months</i>
<i>without touching you.</i>

06:07.500 --> 06:11.571
<i>At least this way, you will</i>
<i>know when I want to touch you</i>

06:11.671 --> 06:13.439
<i>and vice versa.</i>

06:13.539 --> 06:15.875
Well, I hope touching me
is a lot more fun than touching
one of these.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.111
<i>No, no, no, it is.</i>
<i>The texture's for, like...</i>

06:18.211 --> 06:20.113
<i>Can you guys please stop</i>
<i>talking about touching</i>
<i>each other in here?</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:21.948
- Hi, Brandon.
- <i> Hi, Sophie.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.417
<i>Jan, can you get Brandon</i>
<i>out of here?</i>

06:24.517 --> 06:27.920
- <i> Will you stop</i>
<i>calling her Jan? It's "Mom."</i>
<i>- Jan, get your idiot son out!</i>

06:31.858 --> 06:34.627
<i> Why would you grab</i>
<i>my butt? Now the hole.</i>

06:34.727 --> 06:38.297
<i> Dude,</i>
<i>way too much, dawg!</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:41.868
- Is that on Mars?
- Oh! What are you doing?
Get out!

06:41.934 --> 06:43.269
Just looking for the bathroom.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.304
Who walks into bathrooms
without knocking?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.306
Walt. Is this live?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.108
How did they solve
for the time delay?

06:49.208 --> 06:50.943
<i>It's called quantum splicing.</i>

06:51.043 --> 06:52.979
Don't talk to him.
I don't know this man.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.714
- Could we exchange emails
or something?
- No!

06:54.781 --> 06:57.049
- Mine's just "Walt"
five times at...

07:00.052 --> 07:01.554
I'm sorry. I can replace it.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.289
Unless it's expensive.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.957
- Get out.
- Right now?

07:05.057 --> 07:06.659
Yes, right now!

07:09.162 --> 07:11.330
Sorry. Jules tricked me
into throwing a party.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.000
- <i> And yet</i>
<i>you're in your room.</i>
- Uh, nope.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.104
It's not really a party.
It's more of a soiree.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.672
<i> Sophie, it's fine.</i>

07:19.772 --> 07:21.641
<i>I'm late for work. Love you.</i>

07:21.741 --> 07:23.810
- Love you.
- <i> Love you, Mom.</i>

07:23.910 --> 07:27.013
<i>Go. Mingle. We'll be back soon.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:30.483
<i>And in the meantime, it might</i>
<i>be good for you to have</i>
<i>some new experiences.</i>

07:30.583 --> 07:33.519
Nothing's more overrated
than new.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.588
<i>There's a title</i>
<i>for your thesis.</i>

07:37.423 --> 07:38.658
<i>Sophie,</i>

07:38.758 --> 07:40.126
<i>go.</i>

07:40.193 --> 07:41.661
<i>I'll make sure Calvin</i>
<i>calls you tomorrow.</i>

07:43.763 --> 07:45.698
- Night, Jan.
<i>- Goodnight.</i>

08:05.151 --> 08:07.720
You know, I've been at this
school for three years.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.856
Always said that I'd explore
these woods.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.659
Never have. Guess I thought
that I would just...

08:13.726 --> 08:15.962
I've been going
to this school
for five years.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.664
- Oh, five years, okay.

08:18.731 --> 08:22.401
And I always said I'd explore
these woods too.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.172
But know what?
Somebody already did.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.075
A long, long time ago.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.510
It's over.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.812
There's nothing left
to discover.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.148
You're okay, man.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.851
You're a good listener.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.589
I'm sorry.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.092
I've never seen light flirting
take such a dark turn.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.727
Basically my superpower.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.196
Just one brief conversation
with me will

08:50.263 --> 08:53.266
really leave you
questioning everything.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.068
Not the hero we need, but maybe
the one we deserve.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.838
You know, in about 14 seconds
you're going to get
the sudden urge to jump.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.606
Oh, no. You're safe.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.610
I'm already in the midst
of an existential crisis.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.679
Oh, well. In that case,

09:06.746 --> 09:08.281
Walt, at your service.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
- Ginny.
- Ginny?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.451
Yeah, the, uh,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.120
astrophysics major?

09:15.621 --> 09:18.124
How did you know that?

09:18.224 --> 09:21.060
I was in your Intro to
Fluid Dynamics class.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.929
Freshmen year.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.031
This is the part where
you at least pretend
to remember me.

09:25.097 --> 09:28.868
- Oh, my God! Walt! Wow.
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.303
Changed your major?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.604
Sixteen times.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.639
Only for
personal reasons like...

09:34.774 --> 09:36.742
I have no idea what physics is.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.279
But enough about me.
Tell me about your crisis.
What's going on?

09:41.380 --> 09:43.115
Well, I'm

09:43.215 --> 09:45.051
supposed to move tomorrow.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.086
Big move, actually in, uh,

09:48.254 --> 09:50.823
seven hours and...

09:50.923 --> 09:52.291
Let's just say
it's a big commitment

09:52.391 --> 09:55.127
and I'm not
a big commitment kinda gal.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.063
Are you saying we're in
one of those

09:57.129 --> 10:00.266
classic "we-only-
have-tonight" scenarios?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.568
Will spending it with you
make me wanna stay?

10:04.503 --> 10:07.173
Now,
the thing about here,

10:07.273 --> 10:08.608
is that it's mostly garbage.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.409
As you can see, to your left
and to your right

10:10.476 --> 10:12.311
there's literal garbage
overflowing from

10:12.411 --> 10:13.913
these receptacles at all times.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.848
- Yeah.
- And it might magically
seem to disappear

10:15.948 --> 10:18.751
but it's really just added
to that big floating pile
of garbage

10:18.818 --> 10:20.286
in the Pacific Ocean.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.021
Currently the size of Texas
and visible from space.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.589
How scenic.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.691
Now, the one great thing

10:25.791 --> 10:27.693
about this particular
garbage factory

10:27.793 --> 10:29.962
is its connection to
the last best chance

10:30.029 --> 10:32.331
any of us have
at a real adventure.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.035
The Kovi Industries
Mars Program.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.870
So that's how
they got you here.

10:37.970 --> 10:43.876
Yeah. But tomorrow another ship
will leave for Mars without me.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.711
You could always rob a bank
and buy a ticket.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.980
- Yeah, I'd have to rob,
like, nine banks.
- Hmm.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.349
I have considered
the old air ducts plan.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.119
You know, hide in the air ducts
survive on stolen food.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.554
Pee in bottles that you dump
into other people's toilets
while they sleep.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.358
And hope they would be
so impressed when I arrive
that they just let me stay.

11:04.630 --> 11:08.401
Curious how you spin garbage
into this spot.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.503
This is
a garbage-free zone.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.143
It's like Mars.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.978
Did you know that they send
all of their trash

11:19.045 --> 11:20.880
back to Earth
on the return flights?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.652
Okay, I gotta know.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.088
Why Mars?

11:34.527 --> 11:38.764
I feel like if I had been born
like 600 years ago

11:38.864 --> 11:42.868
I would've stolen a boat
and just set sail by now.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.437
And I probably would've died.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.738
Oh, definitely would've died.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.339
But it would've been
an adventure.

11:48.607 --> 11:49.775
You know?

11:49.875 --> 11:52.511
And now there's Mars
and I keep applying,

11:52.578 --> 11:54.680
but 36 rejections later

11:54.747 --> 11:56.382
and I'm starting to get
the feeling that...

11:56.449 --> 11:59.185
They don't need
extraordinary mediocrity?

11:59.251 --> 12:01.120
Yeah. That's funny.

12:05.691 --> 12:07.093
No, I get it.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.897
"Mars has been our mirror

12:13.065 --> 12:14.633
our foil.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.237
A telltale reflection of what
has been deepest in our hearts.

12:20.106 --> 12:23.109
We've seen in Mars the utopia,

12:24.143 --> 12:27.313
a wilderness, a sanctuary.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.751
With so few landmarks,
guideposts, or constraints

12:32.918 --> 12:34.453
all is possible.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.757
Mars has been a blank canvas

12:37.823 --> 12:39.725
and tenderly

12:41.127 --> 12:43.162
our human seeking
has rushed to fill it."

12:44.663 --> 12:46.398
Did you come up with that?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.135
No.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.336
Oh.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.139
Sarah Stewart Johnson.
Astronomer.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.673
- Smart.
- Hmm.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.678
I think

12:59.779 --> 13:01.981
when you look at something
from this distance,

13:02.081 --> 13:04.083
it's all possibility.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.186
Then every step you take
toward that

13:07.286 --> 13:09.789
strips it away until

13:09.855 --> 13:11.490
it is what it is.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.459
And what it always has been.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.781
I'll miss you.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.884
- Walt, from Earth.
- Okay.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.853
If you ever make it up there,
give me a call.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.189
Up where?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.125
Mars.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.360
You convinced me.

13:51.797 --> 13:52.998
Wait.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.234
What?

14:58.564 --> 15:01.533
<i> The application window</i>
<i>for tomorrow's launch</i>
<i>is closed.</i>

15:01.600 --> 15:04.536
<i>- Would you like to apply</i>
<i>for next year's mission?</i>
- <i> No.</i>

15:04.603 --> 15:06.605
I need you to check
an existing application.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.908
Applicant ID 781-2439.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.576
<i>Thirty-seven</i>
<i>applications found.</i>

15:10.643 --> 15:12.411
<i>Application one, rejected.</i>

15:12.478 --> 15:15.314
<i>- Application two, rejected.</i>
- Stop, stop. Please stop.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.549
Application 37
is pending review

15:17.616 --> 15:19.451
and I need you to approve it.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.053
I need to be
on that ship tomorrow.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.621
To be with the girl
of my dreams

15:22.721 --> 15:25.324
who has slowly stopped
responding to my texts.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.726
My chance at a relationship
is imploding

15:27.793 --> 15:29.128
like a dying star.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.063
- Do you understand?
<i>- I do, Walt.</i>

15:31.130 --> 15:34.166
<i>And I sincerely hope</i>
<i>you can ask her out</i>

15:34.266 --> 15:35.834
<i>in 412 days,</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:38.237
<i>- after next year's mission.</i>
- Okay.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.838
Angie. Angie.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.974
I hate to say these words.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.109
I really do.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.946
- I need to speak
with your supervisor.
<i>- Of course.</i>

15:47.012 --> 15:48.514
<i>- One moment.</i>
- Yes, Angie!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.616
<i> I am Alan,</i>
<i>Angie's supervisor.</i>

15:50.683 --> 15:53.285
- Yes, Alan! Go, Alan!
<i>- Reviewing now.</i>

15:53.352 --> 15:55.688
<i>- Application rejected.</i>
- No!

15:55.788 --> 15:58.524
- Alan!
<i>- Commercial tickets</i>
<i>are still available</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:02.594
<i>for the discounted price</i>
<i>of $937,000.</i>

16:02.661 --> 16:04.363
<i>Wow, wow, wow!</i>

16:07.499 --> 16:10.035
Who could afford that?

16:10.135 --> 16:13.038
- Greetings, Walt.
- Sorry I'm late, Gary.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.374
Do not worry.
I have already docked your pay.

16:15.474 --> 16:21.013
- The lonely human at table 7
- B
has not moved for five hours
and 11 minutes.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.515
Shit. I know her.
I broke her orb.

16:23.615 --> 16:26.185
Tell her to order
a beverage or leave.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.486
Oh, come on, Gary.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.555
Oh, come on, Walt.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.695
Hey! You probably
don't remember me.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.731
You broke my orb.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.332
Good memory.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.836
Is that supposed to
make us even?

16:43.902 --> 16:46.638
No. But if you don't
order anything,
you can't use the Wi-Fi

16:46.705 --> 16:49.408
and sit here
like a black hole of sadness.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.078
- Company policy. It is.
- Stupid policy.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.747
And you're gonna
have to pay for that.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.383
Because if I do,
Gary will just
ask you to leave.

16:57.483 --> 16:58.917
Are you serious?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.686
Rarely. But right now, yes.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.523
Yay.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.593
How's the Mars boyfriend?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.194
He's great.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.929
- Yeah, he got
his Martian dream job, so...
- Wow.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.766
...one year of long distance
just became indefinite.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.733
And then my Wi-Fi cut out.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.069
Probably because of all
the calls with him
trying to make it work.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.339
And now I'm sitting here,
suffering in public

17:20.406 --> 17:22.407
and paying for drinks
that I didn't order.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.343
So you tell Gary,

17:24.410 --> 17:26.278
I hope he gets malware.

17:28.747 --> 17:32.451
I hope she fails to find
long-term companionship

17:32.551 --> 17:34.920
and learns the pain
of a solitary life.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.736
I'm not paying
for that one.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.072
Believe it or not,

17:53.138 --> 17:54.473
I might be the only person here

17:54.573 --> 17:55.941
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.543
Because you're causing it?

17:58.777 --> 18:02.481
No. Because my girlfriend

18:02.581 --> 18:04.550
left for Mars a month ago

18:04.616 --> 18:06.885
and hasn't texted me back
in three days.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.626
How long have you guys
been together?

18:14.726 --> 18:18.263
Since ninth grade.
So, eight years.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.599
Eight years?

18:20.666 --> 18:23.635
- How did you manage that?
- We had a plan.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.004
One year, long distance
and then

18:26.105 --> 18:28.974
he comes back to Earth
and I graduate

18:29.074 --> 18:31.610
and we use his terraforming
expertise and my focus

18:31.677 --> 18:35.647
on eco reconstruction
to jump-start an algae-based
waste reduction technology.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.851
- What?
- Plants that eat garbage, okay?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.986
It's how we're gonna save
the world.

18:41.086 --> 18:44.256
- You're smart.
- I know.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.592
And what about you guys?

18:48.327 --> 18:50.195
Ginny?

18:50.295 --> 18:53.632
We've been dating since
freshman year-ish.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.000
It got serious recently.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.369
What does this Mars genius have

18:57.469 --> 18:58.837
that I don't?

18:58.937 --> 19:01.807
- Everything. Yeah.
- Everything?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.709
Could you actually be
more specific?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.777
I'm trying to figure out why
they keep rejecting
my applications.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.350
He checks
all the boxes.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.487
Oh. You mean, literally.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.056
Okay, let's see.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.058
"Quiet. Strong jaw.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.294
Mental fortitude. Six-pack.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.466
Good family, cool mom."
I have a cool mom.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.301
Yeah? You guys close?

19:29.368 --> 19:31.370
No. I mean "cool," like when
she was going
through the divorce

19:31.470 --> 19:34.072
I was able to just do whatever
I wanted from 12 on.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.541
Anyhow. "Hates video games.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.177
Pragmatic and high-earning
potential."

19:40.379 --> 19:42.314
- It's interesting.
- What?

19:42.381 --> 19:44.316
That's an impossible checklist.

19:44.383 --> 19:48.420
- That's my cue.
- You know,
if you really love this guy

19:48.520 --> 19:51.990
I do know a way that you can
get on that ship tomorrow.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.426
Two words.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.261
Air ducts.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.664
- Or I could just buy a ticket.
- Yeah, for like
a million dollars.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.704
Do you have a million dollars?

20:05.771 --> 20:09.274
- My finances are personal.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.177
That means you have
at least two million dollars.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.845
What are you doing here?

20:13.912 --> 20:15.280
Buy a ticket!

20:15.380 --> 20:18.217
- It's your last chance
for a year.
- I can't.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.018
You have the money.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.788
I have aerophobia.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.090
Well, we're all afraid
of arrows.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.359
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid of flying.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.096
- And now I'm trapped.
- You're trapped? I'm trapped.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.098
- Gary, door!
- I can't even
get through security

20:33.198 --> 20:35.200
to see
a shuttle launch up-close.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.937
- Unlock the door, Gary.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
Perhaps it's malware.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.540
You can transcend
time and space.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.742
In the name of love.
The ultimate adventure.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.245
I'm filing a complaint
to corporate right now.
Open the door.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.447
No need
to call corporate.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.482
A simple misunderstanding.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.919
Walk away. Just like
I knew you would.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.623
- You don't know anything
about me.
- I know everything about you.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.157
No!

20:59.258 --> 21:02.227
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away!

21:07.332 --> 21:09.835
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.070
The only people
that know me are...

21:13.438 --> 21:14.673
Gary?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.675
Oh, God, that's sad.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.610
No, no. No. Please, please.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.680
Don't call corporate on Gary.
He's just gonna take it
out on me.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.448
Calvin is on Mars.

21:23.515 --> 21:25.417
Jan, Brandon, Jim,
they're all there.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.286
How many boyfriends
do you have?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.021
It's really that simple.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.296
Goodbye, Walt.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.385
<i>Hey.</i>

22:00.485 --> 22:02.454
<i>I know I went radio silent</i>
<i>for a hot minute,</i>

22:02.521 --> 22:04.990
<i>but I promise</i>
<i>this will make up for it</i>

22:05.057 --> 22:07.192
<i>because...</i>

22:07.292 --> 22:10.862
<i>you just got the world's first</i>
<i>interstellar cat video.</i>

22:10.962 --> 22:14.499
<i>This little genius snuck into</i>
<i>one of our escape pods</i>
<i>back on Earth.</i>

22:14.566 --> 22:17.869
<i>Now, she's gonna be</i>
<i>the first cat on Mars.</i>

22:17.969 --> 22:20.539
<i>I named her Ripley. Say hi.</i>

22:22.641 --> 22:26.345
<i>This little genius snuck into</i>
<i>one of our escape pods</i>
<i>back on Earth.</i>

22:28.080 --> 22:33.218
<i>- ...into one of our escape pods</i>
<i>back on Earth.</i>
- Oh, my God.

22:33.318 --> 22:36.021
Walt, I saw you
consuming alcohol.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.423
I must administer
a breathalyzer.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.659
- Breathe on my face.
- Bye, Gary.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.697
- I'll miss you.
- Goodbye, Walt.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.266
I have already forgotten you.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.846
Okay.
You can do this. You're okay.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.523
<i> I'm billionaire</i>
<i>astronaut Leon Kovi</i>

23:11.590 --> 23:16.294
<i>and it's my pleasure to welcome</i>
<i>you to the Kovi Industries</i>
<i>International Spaceport.</i>

23:16.395 --> 23:19.765
<i>Together, we can build</i>
<i>a better world</i>

23:19.865 --> 23:21.633
<i>on a different world.</i>

23:21.733 --> 23:24.069
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.737
What are you doing here?

23:25.804 --> 23:27.806
And what are you wearing?

23:27.906 --> 23:30.409
I just came to see the launch.
And I got all this duty-free.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.077
Wore it right out of the store.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.146
Duty-free doesn't mean free.
You just robbed a gift shop.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.881
What? No.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.449
Wait, really?

23:39.451 --> 23:43.321
Look, I just came to apologize.
I was a dick.
Also, I need a favor.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.824
You are the ingrown toenail
of humanity.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.393
- Leave me alone.
- Just hear me out
for one minute.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.495
All I need is for you to tell
security I'm your family

23:50.595 --> 23:52.264
- so I can accompany you
to the gate.
- What?

23:52.330 --> 23:55.000
No. God! I'm leaving this
planet largely because of you.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.636
And I totally understand.
Again, so, so sorry.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.172
- It's just...
- It's just, "Go away."

24:03.275 --> 24:05.076
You had a plan, right?

24:05.143 --> 24:06.778
So you know what it feels like
when that plan
gets taken from you.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.680
How it just kills you?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.982
I barely got in this school.
I took out 100 loans

24:11.082 --> 24:13.985
and I worked a dozen crappy
jobs because this was my plan.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.454
To go to Mars.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.689
And now Ginny is there
and I have to be with her.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.358
I have to adventure with her.
Just like you.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.594
- Just like Kelvin.
- Calvin.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.463
Just like Calvin.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.364
But now Ginny is gone.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.935
And all I have left is
one last chance to see
a rocket launch up close

24:30.001 --> 24:33.038
which I have dreamt about
for as long as I can remember.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.440
Sophie...

24:35.507 --> 24:38.043
you can keep my dream alive,

24:38.143 --> 24:40.512
if only for
a couple more hours.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.319
Please. Please help me.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.223
You are not allowed to talk.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.629
And on the first
colonial mission
the ship's hull was damaged.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.397
Kovi had to survive
in the air ducts.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.233
Now, he almost died,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.502
but his lung capacity
is unparalleled.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.137
My lung capacity is also
kind of unparalleled.

25:06.204 --> 25:07.973
When I was a kid, I actually
went under in the wave pool.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.474
I was down there for, like,
three minutes

25:09.541 --> 25:11.243
before anyone could
even pull me back up.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.379
They all thought I drowned,
but I really just passed out.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.548
That's why I never go to
the bathroom in the wave pool.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.984
Did you know that this whole
building is triple-reinforced
with concrete?

25:19.050 --> 25:22.020
Space concrete. In case
the shuttle explodes
on the launchpad.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.422
Which has only happened twice.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.258
- What's happening?
- Shut up.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.426
It's something I have to do
when I'm nervous.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.897
- I dance to relieve tension.
- No, no, no. I'm into it.

25:33.498 --> 25:35.267
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm not.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.936
This is the first
interesting thing
I've seen you do.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.604
I hate when boys
do that.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.174
As if they are the arbiters
of all that is interesting.

25:46.177 --> 25:48.113
<i> Final call</i>
<i>for all zones.</i>

25:48.213 --> 25:50.348
<i>Final boarding call</i>
<i>for all zones.</i>

25:55.453 --> 25:57.923
- Okay. This is it.
- This is it.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.591
Goodbye forever, Walt.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.694
- Well, maybe not forever.
- Forever.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.963
Oh, I actually
got you something.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.631
Don't worry,
I paid for it this time.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.300
But Duty Free should really
change its name.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.269
- Walt.
- Right. Yeah.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.871
Thank you for everything.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.706
Also, makes us even
for the orb.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.076
Sure. We're even.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.952
Last guest on.
Locking up the gate.

26:39.464 --> 26:43.001
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.171
Three Mississippi.

26:46.271 --> 26:51.009
Cosmic background
temperature is currently
minus 455 degrees Fahrenheit.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.067
<i>Welcome to the Kovi Industries</i>

29:29.234 --> 29:31.136

30:08.139 --> 30:09.674
Right this way.

30:09.774 --> 30:13.545
- Straight down the hallway.
- I love you. Call me.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.283
<i>Captain Tarter, you are needed</i>
<i>on the flight deck.</i>

30:18.349 --> 30:21.519
<i>Although the computer</i>
<i>is piloting the ship.</i>

30:30.361 --> 30:32.897
- You.
- I work here.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.200
Oh, thank God it's you.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.868
You asshole!

30:36.968 --> 30:39.070
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You used me.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.840
No. A little. I can explain.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.576
I'm gonna hide
in that air duct. You're never
gonna see me again.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.378
Until you get caught. Or die.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.514
I'm not gonna get caught.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.417
- I already caught you.
- Exactly. What are the chances
that's gonna happen again?

30:54.052 --> 30:56.254
- You're so strong.
- Shut up.

30:56.354 --> 31:00.258
They will run your information,
they will link you to me.
I brought you through security.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.427
- Aiding and abetting.
- Yeah, but you didn't know.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.762
Best case scenario, they send
us back in escape pods.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.098
No, I can't get back
on one of those things.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.500
And you go to the jail
for five to ten. I would be put
on a no-fly list indefinitely.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.736
I can't see Calvin
or any of them.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.872
For years, we'll...
What are you doing?

31:13.938 --> 31:16.574
I'm texting Ginny.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.449
I broke your orb by accident.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.051
It is a closed network.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.387
You text Ginny, anyone, you...

31:30.255 --> 31:33.725
We get caught.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.560
Then let's get in
the air ducts.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.030
Come with me.

31:43.101 --> 31:45.136
<i>Hello, Sophie.</i>

31:45.236 --> 31:47.972
<i>Initiating</i>
<i>ambient sound control.</i>

31:50.541 --> 31:53.611
Hey. You cannot,
under any circumstances,
leave my room, okay?

31:53.711 --> 31:55.380
- What?
- I will sneak you in food.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.283
There's a bathroom.
It'll be like camping.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.285
Okay, clearly you've never gone
camping before

32:00.385 --> 32:03.655
and I'm not going to spend
my first trip to space
on the toilet.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.490
Because you prefer
the air ducts?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.158
Because what
do you think happens

32:07.258 --> 32:09.327
when two people are trapped
in the same room together?

32:09.427 --> 32:12.163
When two
humans are confined
for an extended period

32:12.263 --> 32:14.299
it results in
either more humans,

32:14.399 --> 32:15.833
or fewer humans.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.568
- Who is that?
- That's Cornelia.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.570
Complimentary AI
for the journey.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.773
And I'm your captain, Tarter.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.241
Captain Tarter.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.745
Calvin.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.181
- I like your sauce.
- It's Captain.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.183
The sauce is my father.

32:35.653 --> 32:36.921
What the fuck?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.324
I don't remember you
from orientation.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.025
What happened?

32:41.125 --> 32:43.261
Did you have to come right back
and just rip his jumpsuit off?

32:43.328 --> 32:46.631
- Yeah?
- This is Sophie,
my girlfriend.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.333
Long-term girlfriend.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.705
I don't believe it.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.541
I'm gonna have to rename
this corridor Lovers' Lane.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.309
Tabby! Celeste!

32:58.376 --> 33:00.044
Come meet your new neighbors.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.981
Hello. I'm Tabby.

33:03.047 --> 33:05.550
- This is Celeste.
- Hi. I'm Celeste.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.518
- Sophie.
- Calvin.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.554
- I'm a scientist.
- Engineer.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.956
- Double threat.
- Enough shoptalk.

33:12.023 --> 33:15.493
Tabby and Celeste over here,
or can I call you
Taboo and Celery?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.228
They've been engaged
for nine years.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.697
We are actually not engaged.

33:21.032 --> 33:23.968
Yet. It's just when we were
talking earlier

33:24.035 --> 33:27.739
I was saying,
"We'll probably get engaged

33:27.839 --> 33:29.640
once we get to Mars."

33:29.707 --> 33:32.744
- Congratulations?
- You know, as captain,

33:32.844 --> 33:35.046
I could marry all of you guys.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.581
I mean, not like
a four-way thing.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.583
- Two weddings.
- We should do this.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.651
- No.
- Full disclosure. I just need
to have a party on this ship.

33:40.718 --> 33:43.521
Honestly. I can pilot
a four-billion-dollar spaceship

33:43.588 --> 33:47.425
through an asteroid belt,
but I can't get one of you guys
to let loose.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.160
You know what
I'm talking about?

33:49.227 --> 33:50.828
You don't.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.865
Well, it was nice to meet you.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.366
Yeah.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.101
Okay.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.338
All right, you guys.
Just need to see your ID
so I can check you in,

34:00.405 --> 34:02.240
and I'll be out
of your love nest.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.179
I don't seem to have
my ID on me. I don't wanna
hold you up.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.181
I can run it by
the bridge later.

34:11.248 --> 34:12.717
I knew it.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.920
You're the looks,
she's the brains.

34:17.021 --> 34:18.889
Yeah.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.893
Listen, when you find it,
just scan it on the wall
and Cornelia will log you in.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.096
'Kay? Awesome.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.734
Ooh, happy early birthday.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.302
How old is she gonna be?

34:33.804 --> 34:37.208
Trick question.
You never say a woman's age.

34:37.275 --> 34:40.311
- How old do I look?

34:40.411 --> 34:42.246
- Trick question.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.284
A-hole.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.422
- It's your birthday?
- In two weeks.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.757
- Listen, I gotta...
- We should throw a party!

34:53.824 --> 34:55.326
I don't do birthdays.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.061
Jehovah's Witness?

34:57.128 --> 34:58.996
No. They're arbitrary,
and we don't need
any extra attention.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.898
Well, extra attention
is kinda the point.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.134
Oh, no, I see what you mean.

35:03.234 --> 35:06.304
All onboard data flows through
the manifest, which is
controlled by the ship's log.

35:06.404 --> 35:09.107
So if anyone knows
how to print you an ID,
it's them.

35:09.173 --> 35:10.508
How do you know all this stuff?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.110
Do you think I would let
the love of my life

35:12.176 --> 35:14.178
take one of these ships
across the solar system

35:14.278 --> 35:16.414
without knowing exactly
how it's made?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.984
Don't say that
like it's normal.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.163
Hello?

35:39.971 --> 35:43.174
R-I-G... G?

35:47.345 --> 35:48.513
Huh.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.050
Says here you were already on
the Olarun Two.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.785
Oh, there...

35:54.852 --> 35:57.121
Earl, this is a clerical error.

35:57.188 --> 36:00.358
You know how computers
just get buggy sometimes?

36:00.458 --> 36:02.894
Why are you two standing
so far apart?

36:02.994 --> 36:06.164
Most young couples are all over
each other, kissing...

36:06.230 --> 36:08.499
at an alarming frequency.

36:08.566 --> 36:09.634
Yeah.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.736
That makes sense.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.171
Right, sweetie?

36:17.542 --> 36:18.409
Ah!

36:18.509 --> 36:21.512
Say, Earl... what's this?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.515
Space wine.

36:24.582 --> 36:25.483
Cool.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.752
I usually drink alone.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.821
I gave Carla a glass...

36:30.888 --> 36:32.523
but she can't hold her liquor.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.691
Carla?

36:33.758 --> 36:36.194
Oh. Carla, the computer.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.696
You can't hold
your liquor.

36:41.265 --> 36:42.266
Uh...

36:42.900 --> 36:43.768
Earl...

36:51.242 --> 36:52.543
- Oh!

36:53.411 --> 36:54.412
All right.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.881
Soft reboot, Earl.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.116
How do you know
how to do all this?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.886
My thesis is on eliminating
planned obsolescence

37:01.953 --> 37:03.754
and universal
mechanical literacy

37:03.854 --> 37:07.191
as key tools to promote
biospheric sustainability.

37:07.258 --> 37:10.027
It'd be kind of ironic
if I didn't know how to fix it,
you know?

37:10.094 --> 37:12.463
Yeah. Yeah,
I know, I know. I do know...

37:12.563 --> 37:13.431
It's ironic.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.466
Earl, is that you?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.201
I had the most terrible dream.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.370
Let's get you that ID.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.605
Hello, Calvin.

37:21.539 --> 37:22.640
Hello, Calvin.

37:23.874 --> 37:24.976
Hello, Calvin.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.213
Your photo will show up
in all the system reports

37:29.280 --> 37:32.917
so as long as no one does
a deep search,
you should be fine.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.286
Calvin hates social media.

37:35.386 --> 37:38.289
Okay. Amazing.
Wow. My heart is racing.
What are we doing next?

37:38.389 --> 37:39.457
Next? We lay low.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.892
What? No.
Oh, my heart.

37:41.959 --> 37:42.994
- Gary?
- Cornelia.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.495
Cornelia, is my heart normal?

37:44.595 --> 37:46.163
Your biorhythms
are elevated.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.766
You may be experiencing
cardiac arrest...

37:48.833 --> 37:50.501
or sexual reproduction.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.570
Oh, it's definitely not
sexual reproduction.

37:52.637 --> 37:53.838
Okay. We need a routine.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.774
Be seen enough
not to draw attention.

37:57.508 --> 37:59.076
Oh, here we go.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.579
A lecture series by a few
of the Mars specialists
on board.

38:01.646 --> 38:02.780
Hard pass.

38:02.847 --> 38:04.181
- Bathing in zero G...
- Soft maybe.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.851
Food tube cooking, spacewalk...

38:06.951 --> 38:08.019
Spacewalk?

38:08.119 --> 38:09.687
No. You need a partner for that

38:09.787 --> 38:12.356
and there's no way I'm getting
off the ship until it lands.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.359
Come on, Sophie.
We are in the clear.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.827
Let's go have some fun.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.029
We're not gonna get caught.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.097
They're not gonna kick us off.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.332
Check it. Cornelia?

38:21.432 --> 38:22.867
Greetings, Calvin-Walt.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.669
Nope. Just Calvin.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.971
Cornelia, wasn't there
a stowaway on the Olarun Three?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.539
Yes.
A feline was discovered.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.175
And isn't that cat
now the very first cat on Mars?

38:31.275 --> 38:32.610
<i>- No.</i>
- See?

38:32.677 --> 38:34.445
What?

38:34.512 --> 38:36.947
She is awaiting
trial for her crimes against
the company.

38:37.014 --> 38:38.182
Ripley.

38:38.282 --> 38:39.950
And that's why we stick
to the plan.

38:40.017 --> 38:41.819
- What's this?
- Calvin's practice interviews.

38:41.886 --> 38:44.388
If you're going to be him,
you have to get to know him.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.123
You filmed them?

38:46.190 --> 38:49.060
I will download
his thesis for you
and explain it to you,

38:49.160 --> 38:52.830
and show you
some of the messages
he sent me.

38:52.897 --> 38:53.731
The PG ones.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.866
You mean the boring ones.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.569
Cornelia,
please dim the lights.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.208
This is gonna suck, isn't it?

39:04.308 --> 39:06.143
Only for 35 days.

39:15.986 --> 39:19.056
We can do quizzes
at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.158
- Two a day?
- Yes!

39:21.225 --> 39:22.259
What about...

39:22.360 --> 39:23.828
personal intimacy time?

39:23.894 --> 39:25.930
We share that room.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.666
Exercise some self-control.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.008
<i> Hey, there she is.</i>

39:38.075 --> 39:40.444
<i>- Sorry, do we have</i>
<i>a call scheduled?</i>
- No, no, we didn't.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.614
I just thought that you might
be in the mood.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.116
Got to shit.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.351
Wrong room! Wrong room!

39:47.418 --> 39:50.054
Whoa! Whoa! Hypocrite!
Hypocrite! Hypocrite!

39:50.121 --> 39:51.622
<i>Sophie! Sophie?</i>

39:51.722 --> 39:54.125
- You get 10 minutes a day.
- 15.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.293
- Twelve.
- Fine.

39:56.394 --> 40:03.467
Humans. AI. A crucial
relationship that should
always remain professional.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.436
Even I struggle to follow.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.772
We would love it if you would
do a lecture on terraforming.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.774
- No.
- Since you are the expert.

40:09.874 --> 40:14.211
He had a traumatic accident
on stage last year

40:14.278 --> 40:16.914
and he's recovering still.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.249
Did you get an erection?

40:18.315 --> 40:19.750
- What?
- Yes.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.152
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.220
- You have to keep
a low profile.
- I am.

40:23.287 --> 40:26.257
People wanna hang out with me
even after the erection rumors.

40:26.323 --> 40:28.492
It's weird, I know. It's never
happened to me before.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.928
It's because
they wanna hang out
with Calvin.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.663
Ginny doesn't care
if I work out.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.332
She does.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.500
No, she doesn't.

40:38.068 --> 40:38.903
She does.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.072
Hey. No.

40:42.139 --> 40:43.641
Pick it up.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.743
<i> Given my major</i>
<i>in biochemical engineering</i>

40:45.810 --> 40:48.646
<i>and my parents' existing</i>
<i>employment at Kovi</i>
<i>Industries.</i>

40:48.746 --> 40:50.414
<i>Not that I should be hired...</i>

40:50.481 --> 40:53.317
<i>through nepotism or something</i>
<i>like that.</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:55.019
<i>I just mean that maybe if I</i>
<i>could...</i>

40:55.119 --> 40:57.421
- <i> Hey, relax.</i>
<i>- I am relaxed.</i>

40:57.488 --> 40:59.924
<i> You're doing fine.</i>

40:59.990 --> 41:02.126
<i>Why don't you talk about how</i>
<i>we use the same tech on Earth</i>
<i>to aid in waste reduction...</i>

41:02.193 --> 41:03.994
<i>- Sophie.</i>
<i>- ...develop new bioplastics,</i>
<i>and innovate...</i>

41:04.094 --> 41:06.797
- Sophie.
<i>- Please just focus</i>
<i>on the camera.</i>

41:06.864 --> 41:09.667
<i>If I deviate too much,</i>
<i>they'll just skip to the</i>
<i>next applicant, okay?</i>

41:09.767 --> 41:11.635
<i> Sure. Rolling.</i>

41:11.702 --> 41:13.804
<i> Good night,</i>
<i>sweet passengers.</i>

41:13.871 --> 41:17.041
<i>May your dreams be filled</i>
<i>with the counting</i>
<i>of electric sheep.</i>

41:17.141 --> 41:20.277
<i> Hey!</i>
<i>You're coming to Mars?</i>

41:20.344 --> 41:22.646
<i>- And then you go radio silent?</i>
- Mother...

41:22.713 --> 41:24.348
- Hello, Sophie.
- Privacy! Privacy!

41:24.448 --> 41:26.217
- Wait! Are you watching porn?
<i>- You're coming to Mars?</i>

41:26.317 --> 41:27.718
- What? No!
- Lights!

41:27.818 --> 41:29.053
Pause. Just pause.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.554
Play.

41:30.654 --> 41:34.158
<i>Hi. You're coming to Mars?</i>

41:34.225 --> 41:36.827
<i>And then you go radio silent?</i>

41:36.894 --> 41:38.662
<i>I don't know if you're</i>
<i>serious or not...</i>

41:38.729 --> 41:41.732
<i>- but call me.</i>
- You logged in?
Are you kidding?

41:41.832 --> 41:45.002
I couldn't tell if Ginny was
actually excited that I was
coming to Mars.

41:45.069 --> 41:47.304
I'm just trying to get
a more scientific answer.

41:47.371 --> 41:51.242
You're using facial recognition
software to find out if your
girlfriend likes you?

41:51.342 --> 41:54.144
<i>Likelihood of</i>
<i>romantic interest...</i>

41:54.211 --> 41:55.479
<i>- 82%.</i>
- Yeah!

41:55.546 --> 41:57.581
- Who was that?
- <i> I am Gary.</i>

41:57.681 --> 42:00.718
That's Cornelia. I reprogrammed
her name and voice to Gary.
After Gary.

42:00.818 --> 42:02.319
You can't do that.

42:02.386 --> 42:03.988
I'm lonely.
And you don't let me
talk to anyone.

42:04.054 --> 42:06.357
No. You can't change things
without telling me, okay?

42:06.423 --> 42:08.425
There's a plan
and we stick to the plan.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.762
If we don't, we go to jail,
or we get ejected into the sun.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.264
You can't just unilaterally
change things

42:13.364 --> 42:15.432
because you're insecure
about your relationship.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.701
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking
to me or are you talking to
Calvin right now?

42:17.768 --> 42:19.103
What's that supposed to mean?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.171
I didn't change your plans.
Calvin did.

42:21.238 --> 42:24.108
I didn't ditch you
to go to Mars
for a job, Calvin did.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.444
- I didn't refuse
to send you nudes.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.679
Those texts were off-limits.

42:28.746 --> 42:30.614
I saw them by accident.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.784
Where are you going?

42:33.884 --> 42:36.387
I saw Earl eating ice cream,
but they don't serve it
in the cafeteria,

42:36.453 --> 42:39.223
which means he's got his own
little supply that I'm gonna
steal from

42:39.290 --> 42:42.192
because I am stressed.
And when I'm stressed,
I need sugar.

42:42.259 --> 42:43.127
No!

42:53.237 --> 42:54.805
I work here!

42:54.905 --> 42:56.640
Does that ever really work?

42:58.309 --> 42:59.710
Most of the time, yeah.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.145
We have to get out of here.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.479
We are going to get caught.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.215
You are the only person that
ever catches me.

43:05.282 --> 43:06.650
Okay. Okay.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.953
If you're gonna be here,
you gotta pull your weight.

43:09.053 --> 43:11.755
I know you're not used to this
sort of sneaking around,
espionage thing.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.324
I am. I'm the expert here,

43:13.424 --> 43:15.459
so I'm gonna be looking
for the refrigeration unit.

43:15.559 --> 43:17.461
The cooling kind.

43:17.561 --> 43:18.762
Like that one?

43:21.565 --> 43:23.233
Okay. Come on.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.337
Guess this means
I'm kinda grounded
for the rest of the flight?

43:26.437 --> 43:28.339
- Kinda.
- Copy that.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.141
And can you please keep
your opinions about
my relationship to yourself?

43:31.241 --> 43:33.277
You've no idea what
we've been through.

43:33.344 --> 43:34.845
Hello, Sophie.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.180
You're right.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.116
Ambient sound
control activated.

43:39.183 --> 43:40.184
Sorry.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.956
Okay. Apology accepted.

43:46.023 --> 43:48.025
You know,
you're almost always right.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.194
Even in those last three
arguments with Calvin.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.996
And I know I shouldn't
have read them...

43:52.796 --> 43:54.698
but you were right.

43:54.798 --> 43:58.035
It's honestly creepy
and kind of annoying
how right you are all the time.

43:58.135 --> 44:02.339
Especially as someone
who is wrong almost
all the time. Never right.

44:02.439 --> 44:04.375
Well, except right now.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.876
Me saying that you're right--

44:05.976 --> 44:09.380
Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Now, let's go.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.717
And you're totally right
to lock me in here
for the rest of the trip.

44:15.185 --> 44:17.354
But can we please start
my house arrest tomorrow?

44:18.856 --> 44:19.990
Why?

44:22.159 --> 44:24.194
This is made out of algae?

44:27.131 --> 44:28.232
Smells like it.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.334
This is pretty bad.

44:30.401 --> 44:31.902
It's awful.

44:32.002 --> 44:33.237
Calvin would love it.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.538
Okay, that's...

44:35.539 --> 44:36.674
probably true.

44:38.308 --> 44:39.376
I don't know how he does it.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.378
Does what?

44:41.478 --> 44:44.915
Super focused,
algae genius thing.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.083
Like it's all he thinks about.

44:46.183 --> 44:48.218
It's not all he thinks about.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.421
Okay, well...

44:50.521 --> 44:52.556
the great thing
about being Walt,

44:52.656 --> 44:56.760
is that he's not smart enough
to think about any one thing
for too long.

44:57.728 --> 45:00.264
I miss Walt. Good guy.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.365
Handsome.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.369
So, what about you and Ginny?

45:07.337 --> 45:09.039
What about us?

45:09.106 --> 45:12.176
You're flying to Mars
for her. You must
have some sort of plan.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.178
I don't know.

45:15.913 --> 45:18.515
I steal the spaceship...

45:18.582 --> 45:20.617
travel the stars...

45:20.718 --> 45:22.086
adventure.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.223
What?

45:26.290 --> 45:30.227
You've been on a spaceship,
traveling through the stars
your entire life.

45:34.631 --> 45:35.899
Earth.

45:37.801 --> 45:39.970
In a billion years...

45:40.070 --> 45:44.775
we will never build
or find anything quite like it.

45:45.609 --> 45:47.778
It's our only spaceship.

45:50.380 --> 45:54.551
What could we possibly
do out here that
we couldn't do there?

45:56.887 --> 46:01.125
You ever worry the wrong person
is headed to the wrong planet?

46:02.126 --> 46:03.227
Me and Calvin?

46:05.429 --> 46:06.497
No.

46:07.564 --> 46:08.932
We'll be back.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.668
Once his contract
is up...

46:11.769 --> 46:14.304
First his turn, then my turn.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.840
Right. The plan.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.076
We're building a life together.

46:19.143 --> 46:23.514
And when you find
something extraordinary,
you fight for it.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.350
Sacrifice for it. Protect it.

46:27.317 --> 46:28.852
Yes.

46:28.952 --> 46:33.757
Because what most of us
fail to appreciate...

46:33.824 --> 46:39.196
when presented with something
truly unique, is that it will
only ever exist once.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.798
You read my thesis.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.599
I may have even understood it.

46:42.666 --> 46:46.336
That is weirdly touching.

47:02.686 --> 47:04.054
That algae really
isn't sitting well.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.456
Don't mention algae.

47:06.523 --> 47:08.358
Hello, peers.

47:08.458 --> 47:12.229
Unfortunately,
I've just learned
that our scheduled speaker,

47:12.329 --> 47:14.464
Doctor Franklin Dearborn...

47:14.531 --> 47:18.068
has come down with a mild case
of "space madness."

47:18.168 --> 47:20.070
- Awesome.
- And his scheduled presentation

47:20.170 --> 47:24.808
on the theoretical limits
of quantum propulsion
is being rescheduled.

47:24.875 --> 47:27.845
However, I was
logging on to one of
the community terminals

47:27.911 --> 47:32.182
and I came across
this fascinating
thesis presentation.

47:33.317 --> 47:34.484
There it is.

47:35.219 --> 47:37.187
Calvin Riggins...

47:37.254 --> 47:39.189
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

47:39.256 --> 47:42.492
...is our very modest but very
accomplished expert in
terraformation.

47:42.559 --> 47:44.061
And I'm hoping
he'll save the day

47:44.161 --> 47:46.263
by coming up here
and teaching us a bit

47:46.363 --> 47:49.366
about how Mars will someday
be as green as Earth.

47:49.433 --> 47:52.069
Hopefully, greener,
as Earth is dying.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.239
Come on up here, Calvin.

47:57.107 --> 48:00.010
- What do I do?
- I don't know. Maybe just riff.

48:00.077 --> 48:01.411
Isn't, like, talking
your superpower?

48:01.511 --> 48:02.679
Calvin!

48:02.746 --> 48:03.614
One second.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.782
Calvin! Calvin!

48:05.883 --> 48:07.618
Calvin! Calvin!

48:07.718 --> 48:09.887
Give me one of your earbuds.
We'll use it like a
walkie-talkie.

48:09.953 --> 48:11.521
You can just tell me
what to say.

48:12.556 --> 48:13.690
I left them in the room.

48:13.757 --> 48:15.359
Get up here!

48:15.425 --> 48:17.527
Have them eject me
towards the sun.

48:17.594 --> 48:19.429
Calvin! All right,
here he comes!

48:19.529 --> 48:21.932
He's coming up!

48:22.032 --> 48:25.736
Don't worry.
If you get an erection,
keep going.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.777
Uh, hi.

48:36.380 --> 48:41.718
I'm Calvin.
I'm a terraformologist.

48:43.987 --> 48:45.822
Zinger!

48:45.923 --> 48:48.058
Let's start with the basics.

48:48.792 --> 48:50.661
Terraforming...

48:50.761 --> 48:54.298
which comes from
the Latin term "Terra..."

48:54.398 --> 48:56.233
- Oh, God.
- ...meaning "Earth..."

48:56.300 --> 48:58.769
and forming...

48:58.835 --> 49:01.071
That's forming.

49:05.309 --> 49:08.111
"Changing Mars for us."

49:08.779 --> 49:11.848
Changing for us.

49:14.518 --> 49:15.485
Changing...

49:20.757 --> 49:24.695
Someone a lot smarter than me
once said that Mars
is like our mirror.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.365
The reflection of
what is deepest in our hearts.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.267
Calvin, that's so true.

49:30.334 --> 49:32.769
After traveling with you guys
for the last few weeks,

49:32.836 --> 49:36.974
I don't really know
if that's true anymore.

49:37.040 --> 49:41.211
When I look at you,
I see the smartest people
on the planet.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.881
And you've spent
your entire lives

49:44.982 --> 49:49.619
trying to check an impossible
set of boxes...

49:50.988 --> 49:52.622
for Mars.

49:52.689 --> 49:54.391
And I get it.

49:54.491 --> 49:57.361
Mars is awesome. I applied to
this program, like, 37 times.

50:04.501 --> 50:06.303
But maybe
when you find that thing

50:06.370 --> 50:09.239
that you're willing
to cross the entire universe
to be with...

50:11.975 --> 50:14.544
just make sure it's ready
to do the same for you.

50:17.881 --> 50:19.983
Don't terraform yourself.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.220
It's your life, too.

50:36.266 --> 50:37.868
<i>Thanks for listening!</i>

50:39.603 --> 50:40.771
I'm done.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.273
That was it? A little short.

50:43.373 --> 50:44.908
Tabby...

50:45.008 --> 50:46.209
let's get married.

50:47.844 --> 50:49.179
What?

50:49.246 --> 50:51.515
I mean engaged to get married.

50:51.581 --> 50:56.086
Calvin's presentation,
it was useless from
a technical perspective...

50:58.188 --> 50:59.589
but he's right.

50:59.689 --> 51:02.192
I should have
never put Mars before us.

51:03.393 --> 51:04.394
Before you.

51:04.461 --> 51:06.463
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

51:06.563 --> 51:08.532
What say you, woman?

51:08.598 --> 51:09.599
Yes!

51:10.100 --> 51:11.234
Yes!

51:15.739 --> 51:17.140
Listen up, everybody.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.144
Mandatory engagement party
in T-minus 30 minutes.

51:25.048 --> 51:27.317
It's finally happening!

51:27.417 --> 51:29.953
A real dance party!

51:30.053 --> 51:31.955
It's time to shine, bitch.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.794
Hey!

51:47.104 --> 51:48.338
Hey.

51:49.606 --> 51:51.475
Did you make this?

51:51.575 --> 51:53.410
I didn't pack a dress.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.414
You are so annoyingly
good at things.

51:57.481 --> 52:00.283
Coming from a guy that just
inspired an engagement party

52:00.350 --> 52:03.787
with a speech pulled from
the deepest recesses
of his own ass.

52:03.854 --> 52:06.189
Oh, this isn't
an engagement party.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.691
What are you talking about?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.427
It's a birthday party.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.431
I don't do birthdays.

52:15.699 --> 52:18.335
You also
don't fly on rockets

52:18.435 --> 52:20.303
or conspire with stowaways.

52:20.370 --> 52:23.039
I think you just gotta face it.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.175
You're a space criminal now.

52:26.877 --> 52:29.045
Now make a wish. And don't wish
to go on a spacewalk with me

52:29.146 --> 52:31.882
because that's, kind of,
an open-door policy.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.050
Any time. Any time.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.318
Please.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.721
Spacewalk.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.723
My wish.

52:39.823 --> 52:41.024
You got it.

52:43.527 --> 52:45.362
Do you wanna get your parents
on a video call?

52:47.197 --> 52:49.332
My parents died when I was 14.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.135
What?

52:56.573 --> 52:58.675
I'm so sorry.

52:58.742 --> 53:00.043
I had no idea.

53:01.044 --> 53:02.746
Calvin's family took me in.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.415
Well, Jan, actually.

53:05.515 --> 53:09.920
She didn't even hesitate.
It was just,
"Here's your room."

53:10.020 --> 53:11.421
"What are your favorite meals?"

53:11.521 --> 53:14.691
and "I'm ready to go shopping
whenever you are."

53:26.069 --> 53:30.340
You know,
Calvin probably wouldn't
go to a party like this.

53:31.741 --> 53:33.577
Okay. I'll go peacefully.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.278
Just let me have one more song.

53:35.378 --> 53:39.082
No, I mean...
you should be Walt tonight.

53:41.084 --> 53:43.853
'Cause you miss him so much.

53:45.522 --> 53:46.590
Come on, Tsukino.

53:51.561 --> 53:52.596
Yeah!

54:00.904 --> 54:02.806
- Oh, my God, it's our room.
- Here we go.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.808
Ambient
sound control activated.

54:04.908 --> 54:06.543
I should really go
hang up this dress.

54:06.610 --> 54:07.811
Yeah, let's keep it on.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.412
Think of it like
a really big bib.

54:09.479 --> 54:13.083
That space wine hits extra hard
with this altitude.

54:13.149 --> 54:14.884
Oh, my God, Walt.

54:14.951 --> 54:18.421
We are in space,
not high in the sky.

54:18.488 --> 54:21.291
Do you have any idea
how space works?

54:23.326 --> 54:24.928
I'm sorry.

54:24.995 --> 54:29.332
Sometimes you're just so dumb
and it makes me so angry.

54:29.432 --> 54:30.500
I know.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.070
Makes me angry too.

54:41.144 --> 54:42.812
Gary, can you please
dim the lights?

54:45.282 --> 54:47.017
I feel like a Hot Pocket.

54:56.826 --> 54:57.827
Hey.

55:02.432 --> 55:04.868
What should we do for
my birthday?

55:07.937 --> 55:10.206
Something
old Sophie couldn't...

55:11.975 --> 55:15.712
but new Sophie can.

55:17.647 --> 55:18.682
<i> I can't do this.</i>

55:18.782 --> 55:19.883
<i> You can totally do this.</i>

55:19.983 --> 55:21.618
- We're gonna die.
- Eventually.

55:21.685 --> 55:22.786
In glorious battle.

55:22.852 --> 55:24.788
- Let's go back inside.
- No.

55:27.023 --> 55:27.891
Look at me.

55:29.125 --> 55:29.959
On three.

55:30.026 --> 55:31.194
What? What on three?

55:31.294 --> 55:32.662
You know what on three.

55:34.030 --> 55:34.964
Seriously?

55:35.832 --> 55:37.000
One.

55:40.503 --> 55:41.404
One.

55:42.505 --> 55:44.207
- Two.
- Two.

55:44.307 --> 55:45.375
- Three.
- Three.

56:06.429 --> 56:07.931
Whoa.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.532
<i>Kovi Industries</i>

56:09.599 --> 56:11.334

56:19.943 --> 56:21.211
Come on.

56:21.277 --> 56:24.080
Getting closer isn't gonna
change the view.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.349
Getting closer always changes
the view.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.083
No, no, no.

57:00.150 --> 57:00.917
Stay.

57:08.925 --> 57:11.161
You can do this.
You can do this.
He is no better than you.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.229
You're brave. You're strong.
You can do this.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.763
Is it everything you imagined?

57:47.464 --> 57:48.631
No.

57:49.833 --> 57:52.502
Of course it's not.

57:52.602 --> 57:54.170
It's so much better.

58:46.256 --> 58:47.724
What the hell was that?

58:47.824 --> 58:49.492
I don't know.

58:49.559 --> 58:51.661
<i>Please remain calm,</i>
<i>human passengers</i>

58:51.728 --> 58:55.231
<i>as there is nothing</i>
<i>you can do to increase</i>
<i>your odds of survival.</i>

58:55.331 --> 58:57.867
All right.
Listen up, everybody.
Roughly 11 minutes ago,

58:57.934 --> 59:00.937
our hull was breached by an
unidentified piece of debris.

59:01.037 --> 59:02.772
Our O2 reserves
have been pierced,

59:02.872 --> 59:05.108
so we'll be docking
at the Mars orbital station,

59:05.208 --> 59:07.677
and we'll take
a freight shuttle
to the surface.

59:07.744 --> 59:09.579
Come with me.

59:09.679 --> 59:11.614
Hello, Sophie.

59:11.714 --> 59:14.050
They're checking IDs at
the Mars database, which is
basically space customs.

59:14.117 --> 59:15.451
So the moment they scan yours,
they're gonna see that Calvin
is already on Mars.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.719
Oh, shit.

59:16.786 --> 59:17.921
Question.

59:18.021 --> 59:19.355
Do you think you can fit
in my suitcase?

59:20.690 --> 59:22.425
That feels like
a first draft idea.

59:22.525 --> 59:24.460
Okay. Well, if you weren't so
gangly then it might work.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.029
What if we say there
are two Calvins?

59:26.095 --> 59:27.864
The one on Mars
is already the imposter.

59:27.931 --> 59:30.099
I could sleep with
Captain Tarter.
I know that I'm her type.

59:30.199 --> 59:31.634
It's like a honeypot scheme.

59:31.734 --> 59:33.303
We know that she's indebted
to me after that point,

59:33.403 --> 59:35.438
and not because I want to
or anything, but because it,

59:35.538 --> 59:37.040
- you know, would help us--
- Okay, stop.

59:39.242 --> 59:41.411
How do you feel
about air ducts?

59:43.279 --> 59:44.948
<i>O2 reserves dropping.</i>

59:45.048 --> 59:47.650
<i>Human passengers are advised</i>
<i>to remain calm</i>

59:47.750 --> 59:49.586
<i>and breathe as little</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

59:49.652 --> 59:51.821
Sophie for Walt.
Sophie for Walt.

59:51.921 --> 59:53.456
<i>Do you read me?</i>

59:53.556 --> 59:55.458
One hundred bucks says you just
said that into your wrist.

59:56.492 --> 59:57.493
No.

59:58.227 --> 59:59.162
Liar.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.730
<i>Shut up. You need to focus.</i>

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:03.499
At the next junction,
turn left.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.667
Turning left.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.339
- Turned left.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.108
This shaft connects
to the orbital station.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.478
Take me to the what, Sophie?

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:18.982
Do not, under
any circumstances,
go towards the turbine.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.183
- Sophie.
- Walt.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.418
Walt. Walt?

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:26.122
<i>Passengers are advised</i>
<i>to move to Sub-concourse A.</i>

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:28.625
Do not, under any
circumstances...

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.598
lose faith in yourself.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.100
Come on, Walt.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.434
This is a lot easier.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.440
Walt. Walt.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.444
Walt?

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:50.813
Walt?

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.483
Are you up there?

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.555
Of course.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.025
You picked the wrong shaft.

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:07.897
You idiot. You moron.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:08.898
- Hey.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.234
I'm here.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.235
I'm here.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.504
Why wouldn't you say so?

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.339
I thought you were gonna
do the whole

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.241
"She thought he was dead
and then she revealed

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.544
"that she actually thought
he was a great guy" thing.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.981
You need to get upstairs with
everyone else.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.583
I'm gonna be
totally fine down here.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.921
It's pretty cramped up there,
and they already checked
my ID so...

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.596
Is that a tent?

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.769
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.275
This feels wrong.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.943
Sophie. We're camping.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.078
Think of it like foraging.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.747
This is camping-adjacent
at best.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:01.050
Come on. Use your imagination.

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.586
Smells bad. It's uncomfortable.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:06.456
You can go to the bathroom
anywhere you want.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.724
Just like camping.

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.893
I think we need a view.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.733
<i>Beginning orbital rotation.</i>

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.969
<i>Estimated time to arrival,</i>
<i>14 hours.</i>

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.143
Where to go first?

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.811
Wait. Lights.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.147
Good idea.

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.927
Wow.

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.162
Titan.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.331
Good choice.

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.070
Try Europa.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.649
I feel like it's staring at me.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.151
Then look away.

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.186
No.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.488
That's exactly what it wants.

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.957
I can tell this is getting
painful for you.

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.259
Yeah.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.165
Did you just break it?

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.200
No. Just wait.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.641
It's the beginning.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.277
Of what?

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.284
Of everything.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.297
Are those stars?

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:58.301
Dark matter collecting
under the force of gravity.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:05.374
Invisible strings just
pulling everything into place.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.053
And celestial bodies just...

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:21.090
follow.

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.705
What happened?

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:38.174
I think
the universe just ended.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:43.446
- We should...
- I just...

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:44.580
You...

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:47.950
We should probably
get some sleep.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.994
"Buy a small country."

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.330
"Kidnap Gary from
the coffee shop."

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.798
He never leaves.

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:40.069
"Get brain augmenting
chip installed."

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.305
Yeah. I wanna read other
people's minds.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.641
This is
an impossible checklist.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.244
- I deserve that.

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.449
Where are we?

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:57.420
We are about five minutes
from where I grew up.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.456
It's basically
an illegal dump site.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:03.192
My dad used to
bring me out here.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.360
Cool.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.996
It was so dangerous.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.932
Like, exposed wires everywhere,
and broken glass,

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.336
and I got electrocuted,
like, 100 times.

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.004
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:18.374
And it smelled terrible.

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:20.042
Like, so bad.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:25.881
We were gonna save the world,
one broken thing at a time.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:33.022
I loved it.

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:36.325
<i>Sophie? Where are you?</i>

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.526
<i>Call me.</i>

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:45.468
I should probably go up
and call him.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:33.616
<i>Hey. I've been messaging you</i>
<i>since we heard about</i>
<i>the collision.</i>

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.551
<i>Why haven't you called?</i>

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:36.919
My...

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:38.287
My tablet died.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.256
<i>You can't disappear</i>
<i>like that, okay?</i>

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.957
<i>Jan has been losing her mind.</i>

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.893
<i>- Brandon got,</i>
<i>like, really quiet.</i>
- I just...

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:46.062
<i>Which has</i>
<i>never happened before.</i>

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.264
Listen, I need to
tell you something.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.302
Wait...

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:55.738
Where are you?

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:01.544
<i>It was supposed to be</i>
<i>a surprise, but...</i>

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.214
<i>Okay, check it out.</i>

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:09.585
<i>This is your room.</i>

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.122
My room?

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.925
<i>It was Mom's idea.</i>

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:20.328
<i>My dad built</i>
<i>a soldering station.</i>

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:23.165
<i>Brandon put together</i>
<i>a hydroponic garden.</i>

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:27.303
<i>And...</i>

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.272
<i>and your folks.</i>

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:33.509
<i>Already moved in.</i>
<i>Just waiting on your arrival.</i>

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.243
I love it.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.916
<i>I know I don't articulate</i>
<i>things well...</i>

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:44.353
<i>sometimes, emotions, but...</i>

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.955
I know.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.794
<i>You said you wanted</i>
<i>to tell me something?</i>

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.429
No.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:55.865
I'll see you soon.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.666
<i>I'll see you when you land.</i>

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.908
Walt.

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:41.577
Huh?

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.511
Tell me what you think.

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:45.747
I'm gonna hide
in one of these storage boxes
with this O2 canister.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.984
When you find me,
in one of the storage units...

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.219
in about...

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.520
two-and-a-half...

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:54.590
Let's say two hours,
just to be safe.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.358
I can't.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.560
Are you afraid that
I'm gonna be dead?

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.894
No. Walt.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.263
Look, if the box smells like
a dead body...

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.364
just keep walking.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.533
I can't help you anymore.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:10.506
I'm sorry.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.777
But this is my life.

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:18.380
I can't risk it.

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.615
Calvin...

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.084
is here.

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.453
His family...

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:27.089
My family is here.

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.757
And Ginny is here.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.527
Stop acting like our situations
are even remotely the same.

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.462
Right.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:36.131
You're not supposed to be here.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.034
And you are?
'Cause you can buy a ticket.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.705
That's not fair.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:43.973
You know what's not fair?

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.375
Try getting this close
to your dreams

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.576
and having someone tell you

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:50.045
you're not good enough
37 times.

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.947
Or meeting the girl
of your dreams

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.650
the night before she goes
to another planet,
or having to work...

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.918
Wait.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.453
What?

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.091
How long have you
and Ginny been together?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.560
Since freshmen year-ish.

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.262
How "ish"?

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:13.469
The night before she left
for Mars-ish.

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.006
I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.807
No, don't do that,
'cause then I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:23.846
I can't believe
how selfish you are.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.515
You are so obsessed

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.617
with escaping
your average existence

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:33.255
that you would blow up my life,
her life, for what?

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:35.591
For some sort of adventure?

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.359
For some stupid journal entry?

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:41.096
Sophie, I couldn't blow up
your life if I tried.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.698
You're living his life.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.767
That's ridiculous.

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.869
Do you think
he's gonna move for you?

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.538
Do you think he's gonna go back
to Earth for you?

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:52.041
That he's not going to get
offered a better job,

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.376
and you're gonna go along
with it, like you always do?

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.011
You don't know
anything about him.

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:57.613
I actually do.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.815
I've had to be him.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.720
He's never gonna
meet you halfway.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.789
He's never going to follow you.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.793
You're a coward, Sophie.

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:16.899
Someday...

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.569
when that stupid journal
is filled...

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.505
you're gonna flip through it
and realize

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:27.343
just how pointless it all was.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.183
Sophie...

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:39.855
I'm here because
I am wanted here.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:54.570
You are here because no one
cares where you are.

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.275
<i>Identification confirmed.</i>

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.144
<i>Greetings, Walt from Earth.</i>

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.046
<i>You are under arrest on Mars.</i>

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.369
<i>Hello, Calvin.</i>

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.639
And here we are.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.544
Wow.

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:48.817
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home!

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.854
Hi.

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:52.721
I missed you.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:53.956
I missed you.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:04.666
<i>You will be kept here</i>
<i>until the return launch.</i>

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:06.401
<i>If you cannot afford</i>
<i>an attorney,</i>

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.070
<i>one will be provided for you.</i>

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.340
<i>There are currently</i>
<i>no human attorneys on Mars.</i>

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:12.674
If you're not here
to rescue me,

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.209
can you just leave?

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.377
Hey, stranger.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:19.581
What? How are you here?

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:20.749
I know a guy.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:23.652
You know a guy?

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.254
This is Edgar.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.755
'Sup?

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:27.823
Hey, guy.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:29.892
Two minutes?

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.731
He's awesome.

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:36.832
You know what?

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.934
He is awesome.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.102
Wow.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.340
He is also my boyfriend.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:47.910
My new boyfriend.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.613
Oh.

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.083
You're dating my guard?

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:59.221
You followed me to Mars
after one night.

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.790
Kind of needed to start dating
a security guard.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.862
Just to be clear...

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.032
you're not here to rescue me?

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.901
No.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.704
But I did bring you
some company.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.643
Ripley?

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.579
Oh, my God. Hi.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:26.214
What are you doing here?
I thought you were arrested.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:31.820
Time to go.

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.498
You'll be okay, Walt.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.667
I mean, we both know
who you're really in love with.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.338
Mars.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.272
Mars.

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:51.907
And you made it.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.143
More or less.

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.989
It says his application
was rejected like
100 times.

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.991
- Wow, 100 times?
- 37.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:12.461
I don't understand why someone
would wanna be somewhere
they do not belong.

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.596
- Yeah, you've got a point.
- Well, I think it's exciting.

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:17.499
Did you and the stowaway
cross paths, Sophie?

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:18.800
- No.
- No?

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.836
No.
He must've been hiding.

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.838
- Really?
- In the air ducts or something.

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:25.807
- Wow. Can you just imagine?
- That is so stupid.

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:28.010
So, any idea what
you're gonna do

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.378
now that you're here?

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.980
I recommended her for a spot
on my team.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.382
What?

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.350
Well, they love you for it.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.386
You're totally qualified
and they're always looking
for young candidates

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.054
who can carry out
the next phase.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.489
The next phase?

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.691
Yeah, the 12-year
life-cycle trials.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:57.906
Wake up, Walt.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.682
Did you just talk?

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:09.317
It's time to go.

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.019
Gary?

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.022
Is that you?

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:16.358
I didn't really think
the cat could talk.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:28.870
Clear?

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:32.240
Copy.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.414
Come closer.

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:41.349
Hello?

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.296
Okay.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.231
Ripley.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:13.815
Hello, Walt.

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:21.156
Holy shit. It's you.

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.557
Leon Kovi.

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:25.260
I have that same picture
right by my bed.

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:26.995
That sounded weird.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.831
I've thought about meeting you
for a really, really long time.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.168
As have I.

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.137
What?

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:37.005
I have been monitoring
your progress

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:40.308
since you first entered
that escape pod back on Earth.

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.846
Oh, shit.

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.448
<i> Bob,</i>
<i>you seeing this kid?</i>

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.016
<i> Yep,</i>
<i>kid thinks he's invisible.</i>

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.252
You have cameras everywhere?

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:53.155
<i> Bob says,</i>
<i>everybody just act like</i>
<i>you don't see him.</i>

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.090
Why didn't
you arrest me?

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.592
Well, I ran a profile
and the risk of you impacting
the journey

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.661
in a meaningful way
was below zero

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.264
which I didn't even think
was mathematically possible,

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.199
but it was,
it was a negative number, Walt.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:07.536
There was some concern
that you would die
in the air ducts.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.372
And the smell
of your rotting carcass

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.941
might disturb
some of the paying guests.

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:14.943
Bets were made.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.478
I won.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.384
That girl had nothing
to do with it.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:26.555
- Walt!
- She did. But I forced her.
Not, like, forced her.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.123
Blackmail. Light blackmail.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.358
There is no such thing
as "light blackmail," okay?

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:33.361
There's no diet blackmail.
You blackmailed her, it's fine.

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.631
So, what happens now?

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:41.303
Well, the board has voted
to write this off
as a security systems test.

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:43.038
Ship you back to Earth

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.073
and tie you up
in so much legal trouble

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:48.143
that the world at large
will never hear from you again.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.846
Can I at least get
my own escape pod?

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:54.316
Walt, I hate the board.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.585
So, I leaked
the security footage.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.154
I shared your whole journey
with the world.

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.488
Oh. You what?

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:02.090
It's become so popular.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.925
Look how happy it makes people.

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:06.361
I'm told it's called
"Walt-ing."

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:09.764
She's Walt-ing. He's Walt-ing.
They're all Walt-ing.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.099
Walt-ing?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.567
I, myself, can't Walt.
I have a bad back.

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.769
But Alan here has Walted.
Haven't you, Alan?

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.106
I am hiding. I am a sneaky,
sneaky human boy.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:20.742
It's very, very fresh.

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:25.881
And now the board
is terrified of a PR backlash.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:27.949
Please, sit.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.054
You remind me
of a young me, Walt.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:34.456
Emotionally, that is.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.558
Intellectually,
it's more of an apples to...

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.127
whatever a much
smarter fruit is.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.562
What's a smarter fruit, Walt?

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.031
Papaya?

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:44.900
Papaya! Yes.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.301
I'm the papaya.

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.436
Do you know why the papaya
came to Mars, Walt?

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.473
Taxes?

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.309
No, I'm a billionaire, Walt,
I don't pay taxes.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:57.946
I bet the papaya came
for the exact same reason
as the simple little apple.

01:21:58.813 --> 01:21:59.648
Love?

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.917
Love? How old are you?

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.085
No.

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:06.154
You wouldn't settle
for the relentless

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:09.557
onslaught of the quotidian
that is life on Earth,

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:11.426
so you came here...

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.328
- to Mars.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:16.264
This is not just a playground
for the wealthy, Walt.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:20.502
It's a continuation
of our species' rich history

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:25.840
of curiosity and exploration.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:30.645
Now, we need the public
and our investors
to understand that.

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.614
I think that you and I

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.582
could help each other.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.253
You, a barista.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.421
Assistant barista.

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:41.523
A barista's assistant.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.359
Unremarkable in every way.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:47.462
Truly middle of-the-road,
by all metrics.

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:48.697
Okay, I got it.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.800
Stowing away
for an historic journey

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.636
against impossible odds,

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:57.138
secretly facilitated by me,
of course,

01:22:57.205 --> 01:23:02.143
to discover something
that just might make
his meaningless little life

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:06.848
just a smidgeon,
just a tickle more meaningful.

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:11.453
Now, that is a story
people wanna hear, Walt.

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:14.723
Oh, what's this?

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.861
Walt, this has your name on it.

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.730
- This is a contract.
- Contract?

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.665
Ceding control of your likeness

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:26.568
to Kovi Industries
for exclusive use

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.236
in promotional materials

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.572
in perpetuity across
all universes,
known and unknown.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.906
And in exchange...

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:34.576
you may stay here.

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:37.245
Are you serious?

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.880
Welcome to Mars, Walt.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.318
Gary!

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.956
Gary!

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:08.236
Could I have
solved world hunger
with my money, Walt?

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:10.405
Sure. Dozens of times over.

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:13.842
But don't you think it's better
that I came to Mars

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.744
to inspire the next generation
of young people

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:18.746
- to solve world hunger?
- Looking good, guys.

01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:20.682
How handsome.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.484
- Sure.
- Yes, I agree.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.451
Sexy.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.213
Hey, Gary.

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.715
What are they doing down there?

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.217
Preparing the return vessel
for launch.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:58.553
At the conclusion
of each orbital cycle,

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:02.457
the humans celebrate
their domination
of this lifeless planet.

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:03.992
After the festivities,

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.061
broken objects of little value
are sent back to Earth

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.230
for long-term storage.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.999
You mean, garbage?

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.201
Yes.

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:14.569
Like sexual reproduction,

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:17.505
making garbage brings humans
great happiness.

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:20.241
But looking at it
causes deep shame.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.310
It must be hidden.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:27.715
Are we supposed to be here?

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.351
No.

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:34.255
I have asked you to return
to the habitat 11 times.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.256
All right, Gary.

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:37.158
You win.

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.359
I am Victor.

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.223
Hey, Ga... Victor?

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.290
Yes, Walt?

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:13.127
I'm gonna need some tools.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.934
I don't even understand
why you wanna go to this thing.

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.638
It's the return party.

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:24.906
It's gonna be fun.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.075
Plus, you can't work
all the time.

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.644
Which reminds me,

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:31.646
when can I tell them
you can start?

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:33.815
Start what?

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.285
The job.

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:38.886
With my team.

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:40.822
I don't know
if it's the right fit.

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:44.492
Um...

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:51.666
It's the perfect fit.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.434
I mean, it's the same schedule.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.937
I still have to finish
my thesis anyway so...

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:58.006
Yes, I know,

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.976
but, well,
you don't need it anymore.

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:03.344
You're here.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.280
You have a job offer.

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:09.183
You can graduate without it.
You know, it's the past.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.351
It's not the past.

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:14.088
It's supposed to be the future.

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.958
My future.

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:34.375
Yeah, no.

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:36.344
Good stuff, guys.

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:40.281
Shoot me in the face.
That is getting old.

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:43.985
Oh! It almost came
to that, honey, trust.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:48.222
I voted to eject you,
but Kovi, he's a softy.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.124
You knew the whole time too?

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.827
Walt, I have an IQ of 165

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:56.030
and I can pilot
a four billion-dollar
spaceship--

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:59.367
Through an asteroid belt. Yeah.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.501
I'm sorry.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.037
It's okay.

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:08.176
So, how you enjoying Mars?

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:11.679
Honestly, I thought
it would be different.

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.514
I thought that I would get here

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:16.851
and I would be changed
or something.

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:20.188
But now I'm here
and it's exactly the same.

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:25.159
Walt, it doesn't matter
how far you travel,

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:26.894
you can never escape yourself.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.232
Did you just come up with that?

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:34.402
No, bitch.
That is a very common phrase.

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.604
- How have you not heard
that before?
- Never heard it.

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:39.173
Thank God you pretty,
'cause you dumb.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.542
You pretty, but you dumb.

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.544
I'm gonna talk
to somebody smarter.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.460
I should go say hi to the team.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.129
Oh. Okay.

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.146
Hey.

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.751
Is that supposed
to make us even?

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:24.719
No.

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.121
You gotta pay for that.

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:34.662
So, where is the amazing Ginny?

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:40.635
She is with the amazing Edgar.

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:41.736
Her new boyfriend.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.276
You were right, though.

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.078
She was just an excuse.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:58.419
I'm sorry.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:03.491
For everything.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:13.634
So, um, you sticking around
for a while?

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:16.471
Uh, yeah, looks like it. You?

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.214
Yeah, looks like it.

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.323
That's too bad.

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:17.431
Oh.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:33.548
What is that?

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:36.017
Nothing.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.752
Just something silly
someone gave me.

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:44.592
Sophie.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:48.863
You know...

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.134
nothing could ever change

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.970
how much we care for you.

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:59.106
No matter what happens
between you and Calvin.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.043
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.045
Well...

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.147
if it did,

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:08.883
we're your family,

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:11.552
your constant.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.590
You're allowed to change.

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:19.994
Wouldn't it be, like,
crazy awkward?

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:22.463
I think I know my son
better than anyone.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:25.299
He's already crazy awkward.

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:31.906
Sophie,

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:36.110
go, wander.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.447
Figure out what you want.

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:42.483
We're not going anywhere.

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.268
Hey.

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:03.671
Hey.

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:06.474
Can we talk?

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.224
I'm so sorry, Walt.
I'm so sorry.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.660
Launch logistics,
everyone's yapping in my ear.

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:26.994
Where were we?

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.229
Ad campaign.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.163
Right.

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.666
Walt,

01:34:31.732 --> 01:34:34.535
do you remember how I told you,
you could stay?

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:35.736
Yeah?

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.505
Well, we just finished
the first run

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:39.907
of our new campaign
and there's been
a change of plans.

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:40.875
Seriously?

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:45.746
Can I please just have
my own escape pod?

01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:49.517
How about
your very own spaceship?

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.218
What?

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:52.920
We're sending you to Ceres.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.922
It's a tiny,
little dwarf planet

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:57.992
in the main asteroid belt
between us and Jupiter.

01:34:58.059 --> 01:35:00.928
And you are gonna be
the very first person

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:02.763
to ever set foot on her.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.599
Again, what?

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.034
We've set up an outpost.

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:09.170
And it's time
for a ribbon cutting.

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:12.006
You're gonna set up the ribbon,
you're gonna cut the ribbon.

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:14.442
It's gonna be very exciting.
We want you there.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:17.078
That's... That's amazing.
Thank you.

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.012
Hmm.

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.082
But, why me?

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:27.788
- Can I be honest with you?
- Yeah.

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:31.292
People cannot get over
how average you are.

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.294
It's like a superpower
or something,

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:34.462
I don't know what it is.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.263
They look at you,
and they think,

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:38.299
"If this guy can do it,

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:40.968
then I can do
literally anything."

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:44.972
I'll take it.

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:46.974
Great. Good choice.

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:50.478
Listen, you should
probably get in touch
with your family, friends

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.246
or anyone
who's important to you,

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:54.248
'cause you're not gonna
see them for a few years.

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.151
I gotta take this. Sorry, Walt.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:58.819
Hello.

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.421
Yeah, I just ran it by him.

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.890
Yeah, he's happy.
He's super happy.

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:04.558
It'll be an adventure.

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:05.960
He's gonna be like
the Little Prince.
He'll be great.

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:09.263
Hey, Alan?

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.132
Yes, Walt.

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:12.833
Could you place a call
for me, please?

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:15.636
Of course.
Who would you like me to call?

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.173
Sophie Tsukino.

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:21.909
I'm sorry.

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:25.012
Sophie Tsukino is no longer
registered as a resident.

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.647
What?

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:30.518
She is the sole passenger
on today's return shuttle
to Earth.

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:33.921
My records indicate
she has already boarded
the ship.

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:18.566
Oh, it stinks in here.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:20.701
This ship smells so bad.

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:23.404
Walt.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.072
Actually it makes sense.
It's literally filled
with garbage.

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:27.241
Sir, that seat is for
authorized personnel only.

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.376
I know, I'm sorry. Okay.

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:30.978
Wait, how do I...

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.080
- It's the button directly--
- I can't see.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.049
- Sorry.
- Just hold the button.
No, no, no.

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.151
Just hold the down button.
The same thing you did
to get here.

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:40.554
I got it. Sorry. I got it.

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.028
Expect a fine.

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:50.664
Really?

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:58.572
Walt?

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.608
Sophie?

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:02.776
What are you doing here?

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.614
I'm following you.

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.052
Back to Earth.

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:14.255
Even though
I didn't invite you,

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:17.424
or even tell you I was leaving.

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.760
Making it
all the more romantic?

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.864
You literally did
the exact same thing
for another girl last month.

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:25.299
Okay, yes.

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:29.103
I did recently travel across
the universe for love.

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.238
No, no, not love.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:32.606
You barely knew that girl.

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:35.976
Correct.

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:37.411
But I do know you.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:41.882
You're the most
frustratingly, brilliantly,

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:43.751
- contradictorily...
- Not a word.

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:46.587
...annoyingly talented person
I've ever met.

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:51.325
Every time I'm with you,
you make me feel so dumb.

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.395
In the best way possible.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:39:01.302
I'd rather be Mars's garbage
flying back to Earth

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:04.805
than boring old Walt,

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.074
flipping rocks on Mars alone.

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:13.180
So you're really gonna
give up this whole
Mars adventure thing?

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.785
I'm not giving up anything.

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.621
You're the adventure.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.591
Ah! Goddammit.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:26.193
What?

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.634
You come in here
with no plan at all

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:37.004
just expecting everything
to magically work out

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.172
and then somehow,

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:40.808
you pull that line
out of your ass?

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:44.812
Yeah.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.715
You are so annoying.

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:48.649
I know.
