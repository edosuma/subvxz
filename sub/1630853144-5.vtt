Don't you think it's odd
that your old partners

been homeless?
-Since I was 14.

Hey, man,

-Poinsettia.

could see me now.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.118
Oh, they're not perfect.

12:00.237 --> 12:02.120
You didn't talk
to them.

12:02.239 --> 12:03.955
They have
everything figured out.

12:04.074 --> 12:07.041
Is that why you let them think
that I'm your husband?

12:11.631 --> 12:14.332
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. (chuckles)

12:14.451 --> 12:15.200
it's just

12:16.103 --> 12:17.469
they're all married

12:17.620 --> 12:19.387
or they have
committed partners.

12:22.592 --> 12:23.791
And I just didn't
want them to think

12:23.894 --> 12:25.427
I was this unwed mother

12:25.512 --> 12:27.429
who got knocked up
during a one-night stand.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.931
Hey. Isabella,
they're not better than you.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.318
And I don't mind them
thinking that we're married.

12:35.105 --> 12:37.021
But I also want
to let you know

12:37.157 --> 12:39.691
that just because
we're not together,

12:40.827 --> 12:42.277
it doesn't mean
that you don't have

12:42.362 --> 12:43.745
a committed partner too.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.249
Thank you.

12:51.788 --> 12:55.256
Um, so should we talk
about our birth plan?

12:55.342 --> 12:58.659
Oh, yes. Who knew
there were so many methods?

12:58.712 --> 13:01.346
I think that we can
cross off water birth

13:01.465 --> 13:03.548
and orgasmic birth
from the list.

13:04.134 --> 13:05.517
That makes sense, yeah.

13:05.635 --> 13:10.188
Uh, and hospitals
just feel so sterile, so...

13:11.358 --> 13:13.525
I don't know,
what if we did a home birth?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.363
I-- I love the idea,
if you do.

13:18.482 --> 13:19.948
Yeah?

13:21.017 --> 13:22.867
Would we do it here
at the coterie?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.993
I mean, yeah, the baby
would be surrounded
by a lot of love.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.127
Yeah.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.049
Okay, then,

13:38.919 --> 13:40.001

13:40.086 --> 13:41.002

-Yeah.

-We're doing it?
-We're doing it.

-Right here.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.067

14:22.712 --> 14:24.912
And you've been winning
so many pitches without me.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.297
But this is unsustainable.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.216
Agreed. We can't keep
alternating wins.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.134
Mariana
can't keep doing this.

14:34.558 --> 14:35.640
We're going about this
all wrong.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.358
Jackie stole our idea,

14:37.444 --> 14:39.394
and we've been trying to compete
on a level playing field.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.596
What we need to do
is make our app better.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.314
We need a big new idea
that they don't have

14:43.450 --> 14:44.449
-and can't steal.
-You're right.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.451
So we need to get out
of competition mode

14:46.603 --> 14:48.987
and get back
into innovation mode.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.322

30:12.728 --> 30:15.195
uh, the umbilical cord
was wrapped around his neck,

30:15.314 --> 30:17.698

an emergency c-section.

39:09.064 --> 39:09.896
what's going on?

39:10.982 --> 39:12.032
What do you mean?

39:13.568 --> 39:15.568
Why do you wanna delay pitching
the new idea to liza and jackie?

39:15.704 --> 39:18.154
I said why.
And you agreed with me.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.707
I didn't agree.
I backed you up.

39:21.326 --> 39:22.375
Why?

39:31.720 --> 39:34.637
I didn't become your mentor
just because jackie asked me to.

39:38.927 --> 39:39.893
You're right.

39:40.729 --> 39:42.011
I did it to be closer to you.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.181
Not because I'm hoping
to get back together.

39:47.903 --> 39:50.153
Because I-- I know
something's not right.

39:51.690 --> 39:52.856
You're not okay.

39:54.242 --> 39:55.742
And I was concerned

39:55.861 --> 39:57.744
that you wouldn't be safe
with another mentor.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.249
You can trust me.

40:12.127 --> 40:13.176
You're right.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.679
I'm not okay.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.102
I took this job

40:22.220 --> 40:25.105
so that I could prove
that jackie stole
bulk beauty's code,

40:25.223 --> 40:26.439
which they did.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.091
But of course,
she changed it just enough

40:29.144 --> 40:30.393
so that we couldn't
prove it.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.279
So instead, I have been
secretly feeding bulk beauty

40:33.398 --> 40:35.732
intel on all of the brands
that they're going after.

40:35.784 --> 40:39.869
But because I had to sign
a non-compete agreement,

40:40.906 --> 40:42.789
I'm stuck here for two years

40:42.908 --> 40:45.375
unless revitalize
goes out of business,

40:45.460 --> 40:47.877
which makes me feel shitty
because it turns out

40:47.963 --> 40:50.463
that ava and raisa
are actually really nice people.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.950
You know, I just wanted
to make things right

40:54.002 --> 40:56.252
with claire and gina
and rachel,

40:56.304 --> 40:57.971
because this was all my fault!

41:03.512 --> 41:04.511
No, it wasn't.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.931
I set you up with jackie.

41:08.650 --> 41:10.099
She turned out
to be a thief.

41:10.152 --> 41:12.652
So... Really,
it's my fault.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.446
What am I gonna do?

41:27.035 --> 41:42.966
