WEBVTT

00:01.863 --> 00:02.863
Tommy!

00:02.873 --> 00:04.753
Tom, you've got to run
it against the wind.

00:04.763 --> 00:05.943
So, take it the other way.

00:07.103 --> 00:08.303
- That's good.
- Hand me the basket.

00:08.313 --> 00:09.593
- He's good.
- Jack!

00:10.403 --> 00:11.403
What?

00:11.873 --> 00:12.873
Nothing.

00:14.103 --> 00:15.263
Wait, what? Aliena!

00:15.273 --> 00:17.083
No, don't. Stop.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.533
A storm is coming.

00:24.253 --> 00:25.733
I'll go check the
cathedral for cracks.

00:25.743 --> 00:27.713
You should take Tom
back before he gets wet.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.643
God forbid anything should happen

00:28.653 --> 00:30.263
to your precious cathedral.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.283
What did you say?

00:33.723 --> 00:37.033
I said cathedral
first, family second.

00:37.193 --> 00:38.383
That's not true.

00:39.203 --> 00:41.993
- It's my work.
- It's your life, Jack.

00:42.933 --> 00:45.333
- Not me, not Tommy.
- You have your work, Aliena.

00:45.343 --> 00:48.593
Which doesn't compare
to your calling from God.

00:49.143 --> 00:50.783
Prior Philip gives you pittance

00:50.813 --> 00:54.273
for all the hours that you
spend building his church, Jack.

00:54.293 --> 00:55.633
His, not yours.

00:56.253 --> 00:57.423
You're so tired when you come home,

00:57.433 --> 00:59.953
you have little energy for
anything else but sleep.

00:59.963 --> 01:01.863
I'm treated like
a neglected mistress.

01:01.873 --> 01:03.383
I'm not even your wife!

01:03.923 --> 01:06.163
And you think an afternoon
of kite flying and picnic

01:06.173 --> 01:07.613
is enough to make everything fine?

01:07.623 --> 01:10.553
You're not my wife because
you chose to marry Alfred.

01:12.093 --> 01:13.633
I begged you not to,

01:14.043 --> 01:15.433
but Richard needed the money.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.563
And that is all that
you care about, isn't it?

01:17.773 --> 01:19.213
Is Richard's precious title.

01:19.223 --> 01:22.403
Well, that was your naive
promise, Aliena, not mine.

01:24.953 --> 01:26.933
Face the facts. Shiring is a dream,

01:27.243 --> 01:28.273
you will never win it back.

01:28.283 --> 01:30.643
Just as you will never
be a princess again,

01:31.153 --> 01:33.353
only the merchant mistress
of a common laborer.

01:33.363 --> 01:34.643
Now take Tom back.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.933 --> 01:46.903
Someone left this
for you, Your Eminence.

01:48.163 --> 01:49.933
- Who?
- He didn't say.

01:58.133 --> 01:59.633
"Your secret will out.

01:59.643 --> 02:01.143
"Your time as come.

02:01.153 --> 02:03.153
"I Have de proof.
The Ghost of Jack Shareburg."

03:08.233 --> 03:09.413
We'll stop at the inn.

03:13.033 --> 03:14.033
Ma!

04:05.873 --> 04:06.893
What do you want?

04:07.243 --> 04:08.243
Money?

04:08.653 --> 04:09.653
Food?

04:09.663 --> 04:10.923
You must help me, witch.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.703
I can't help you if you kill me.

04:18.253 --> 04:20.423
I don't wanna hurt anybody!

04:22.823 --> 04:23.823
Remigius!

04:27.493 --> 04:29.263
I've no one to turn to.

04:35.103 --> 04:36.743
<i>Whom do you love the most?</i>

04:37.303 --> 04:38.833
<i>And what would you do me?</i>

04:43.003 --> 04:45.173
Mother! No!

04:56.423 --> 04:57.673
Who did this to you?

04:57.923 --> 04:59.253
My husband.

05:01.693 --> 05:02.693
Why?

05:03.193 --> 05:04.993
He was drunk and angry.

05:05.563 --> 05:07.673
He does it often, but
this was the worst.

05:11.773 --> 05:12.993
Who is your husband?

05:16.373 --> 05:17.543
You needn't fear.

05:19.773 --> 05:21.373
I will keep you safe.

05:24.143 --> 05:25.853
William of Shiring.

05:28.573 --> 05:29.573
Elizabeth?

05:37.863 --> 05:39.373
I was in love once.

05:41.303 --> 05:43.003
Love is a terrible thing.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.303
I know, it struck me dead.

05:49.693 --> 05:50.703
Did she die?

05:53.113 --> 05:54.973
He hanged himself.

05:54.983 --> 05:56.503
And I found him.

05:59.803 --> 06:02.093
I was only 13 when he married me.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.213
The Church forbade
him to touch me

06:05.223 --> 06:06.223
until I was...

06:07.223 --> 06:08.533
more mature.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.843
He cared nothing for rules.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.403
He came to me on my wedding night,

06:16.063 --> 06:17.853
and hurt me so badly

06:19.413 --> 06:22.043
that I was unable, after
that, to bear children.

06:24.253 --> 06:28.263
I loved him and he loved me.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.673
How could it be a sin?

06:32.583 --> 06:34.583
But I confessed,

06:34.943 --> 06:39.273
and my confessor made me
denounce him to the others.

06:40.163 --> 06:41.633
And after he took his life,

06:41.833 --> 06:43.253
my confessor

06:43.863 --> 06:45.323
made me fix things

06:45.353 --> 06:48.763
so that I would never be
able to sin like that again.

06:49.893 --> 06:52.023
- You ran away.
- Three days ago.

06:52.883 --> 06:54.903
God help me if he finds me.

06:57.653 --> 06:59.843
Is your confessor still alive?

06:59.853 --> 07:00.853
Oh yes.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.863
You should denounce
him to the Church.

07:02.873 --> 07:05.623
He is the Church.

07:06.713 --> 07:08.093
But I sent him a letter

07:08.673 --> 07:11.173
from the ghost
of Jack Shareburg.

07:13.043 --> 07:15.763
- What?
- Threatening to expose his secret.

07:16.223 --> 07:17.783
But it's all I can do,

07:18.103 --> 07:19.103
is threaten.

07:21.653 --> 07:22.883
What would you do...

07:24.723 --> 07:26.403
to see justice done?

07:30.323 --> 07:31.323
Anything.

07:31.833 --> 07:32.833
Anything.

07:36.073 --> 07:40.483
For our church,
dear God, I would do anything.

07:48.543 --> 07:50.303
There are cracks
in the ceiling?

07:50.313 --> 07:51.713
You mustn't use
the church again

07:51.723 --> 07:53.333
until I find the
cause and I fix it.

07:54.353 --> 07:56.323
You said you'd found a
way to support the weight.

07:56.483 --> 07:57.693
I thought I had.

07:57.813 --> 07:58.863
As did Alfred.

07:58.873 --> 08:00.303
No, the old walls were made for

08:00.313 --> 08:02.363
a wooden ceiling, but
he put stone on them.

08:02.373 --> 08:04.283
These walls, they're
well-buttressed.

08:04.293 --> 08:06.853
- They can hold the weight.
- So why is the ceiling cracking?

08:06.863 --> 08:08.473
I don't know, Prior!

08:08.863 --> 08:10.243
I do not know.

08:11.473 --> 08:14.073
Tom would know.
I am not Tom.

08:28.623 --> 08:30.473
Richard! Richard!

08:31.593 --> 08:32.793
I missed you!

08:33.363 --> 08:34.613
You're home!

08:35.523 --> 08:37.332
And happy to be here.

08:41.342 --> 08:43.732
You're holding in
your arms, dear sister,

08:44.483 --> 08:46.623
the new Earl of Shiring.

08:49.473 --> 08:50.473
It's true.

08:52.743 --> 08:54.653
King Stephen made it
official last week.

08:56.043 --> 08:57.243
Wonderful!

09:02.353 --> 09:04.013
Everything we worked for...

09:06.963 --> 09:08.383
all these years...

09:10.913 --> 09:12.373
Finally, we did it.

09:22.573 --> 09:24.523
There is one
minor complication.

09:25.643 --> 09:27.873
Before we move in, we
have to move William out.

09:27.883 --> 09:29.993
That shouldn't be difficult.
You have friends from the army.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.303
Surround the castle, and, if
William doesn't surrender, attack.

09:33.653 --> 09:35.903
In 17 years of civil war,
do you know how many times

09:35.913 --> 09:38.473
I've seen a castle
captured by frontal attack?

09:38.923 --> 09:39.923
None.

09:40.023 --> 09:42.623
They're taken by cowardice,
treachery and deception.

09:43.493 --> 09:45.633
We need to find a way in
without William knowing it.

09:48.263 --> 09:49.263
What?

09:50.303 --> 09:51.833
What are you smiling at?

09:52.203 --> 09:53.913
We have a way in.

10:02.383 --> 10:03.863
<i>Get a rope round it.</i>

10:04.513 --> 10:06.183
<i>Yeah, open up.</i>

10:10.553 --> 10:11.823
Richard's back.

10:12.323 --> 10:13.723
He's won his title.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.663
William Hamleigh is a tyrant!

10:21.133 --> 10:23.783
He's attacked Kingsbridge,
murdered its citizens,

10:23.793 --> 10:26.323
yet freely walks among
us whenever he wishes.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.783
King Stephen has seen fit
to strip him of his title,

10:29.073 --> 10:31.773
but it is up to us to
strip him of his lands.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.883
I have soldiers,

10:34.893 --> 10:36.893
friends from the crusade
who will lead the charge and

10:36.903 --> 10:38.303
bear the brunt of the battle,

10:38.313 --> 10:40.443
but I need men to back them up.

10:41.253 --> 10:43.693
I will reward you with
what gold we capture.

10:44.123 --> 10:47.083
William will be punished
for the evil he has done,

10:47.163 --> 10:51.343
and the blood of your wives
and children will be avenged!

10:52.133 --> 10:54.363
There's not enough of
us to take a castle!

10:55.083 --> 10:57.423
We'll never make
it inside the gate.

10:57.473 --> 10:58.683
Oh yes, we will.

10:59.853 --> 11:01.593
We have a friend who will help us.

11:13.013 --> 11:14.083
What is it?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.223
You look like
you need to confess.

11:20.793 --> 11:22.213
I've been an ass

11:23.073 --> 11:24.363
and an idiot.

11:24.993 --> 11:26.933
Well, if that's a sin,
we'll all burn in hell.

11:29.663 --> 11:30.443
What about?

11:31.703 --> 11:32.703
Aliena,

11:33.563 --> 11:34.563
the roof,

11:34.573 --> 11:36.773
everything that is
important in my life.

11:40.813 --> 11:42.833
What you said this
morning was right.

11:44.383 --> 11:45.923
You're right, you're not Tom.

11:46.153 --> 11:47.253
You're Jack,

11:47.633 --> 11:49.103
which is something much better.

11:50.253 --> 11:51.563
Tom was a dreamer

11:52.073 --> 11:53.453
with enough faith to
give his dreams weight,

11:53.463 --> 11:54.463
but you...

11:57.043 --> 11:59.193
you have an exceptional gift.

12:00.473 --> 12:01.973
And you have determination

12:02.263 --> 12:03.453
instead of faith.

12:04.063 --> 12:07.063
We all need faith, Jack.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.363
It makes it easier
for God to help us.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.813
And Aliena believes
in you more than you do.

12:15.363 --> 12:16.943
How much faith
do you have in her?

12:20.553 --> 12:22.353
What do you mean, Prior?

12:22.933 --> 12:24.633
She left an hour ago with Richard

12:24.643 --> 12:26.453
and an army of men
to retake Shiring.

12:28.323 --> 12:30.093
She's gone? Prior?

12:46.573 --> 12:47.573
Edgar.

12:48.293 --> 12:49.293
Oh, milady.

12:49.713 --> 12:50.993
Is Lord William here?

12:51.203 --> 12:52.743
No, he's out looking for you.

12:57.263 --> 12:58.663
Assemble everyone
in the courtyard.

12:58.673 --> 13:00.123
I have an announcement to make.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.133
Yes, milady.

13:02.563 --> 13:03.673
Leave it open, Edgar.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.863
- But, milady?
- Leave it open.

13:11.173 --> 13:12.863
All, silence for milady!

13:15.043 --> 13:17.073
I have come to bid you all goodbye.

13:17.913 --> 13:18.983
I am no longer your lady

13:18.993 --> 13:21.533
because my husband is
no longer your earl.

13:23.353 --> 13:25.883
King Stephen has awarded
the title to Richard,

13:25.913 --> 13:27.723
whose father once ruled here,

13:28.183 --> 13:31.283
and whose sister, Aliena,
some of you may remember.

13:33.463 --> 13:37.273
I am surrendering the castle
to the rightful Earl of Shiring,

13:38.733 --> 13:41.293
and command you all to
lay down your weapons.

13:41.943 --> 13:43.763
There will be no bloodshed.

14:29.813 --> 14:31.693
The castle is taken, Walter.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.073
But I'm not!

14:39.153 --> 14:40.393
<i>No bloodshed!</i>

14:40.423 --> 14:41.593
No, wait.

15:48.923 --> 15:50.423
Now we're even.

16:02.973 --> 16:04.853
Now we're even.

16:23.993 --> 16:25.243
She betrayed me,

16:26.013 --> 16:27.703
my own wife.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.433
If you kick a dog...

16:30.533 --> 16:32.533
it may someday bite you.

16:33.403 --> 16:34.683
Your mother never learned that,

16:34.693 --> 16:36.533
and now she burns in eternal fire.

16:36.543 --> 16:38.733
Nonsense, she is in heaven,

16:38.973 --> 16:40.953
kneeling before the throne of God.

16:40.963 --> 16:43.773
She's in hell, William, and
rumor has it you put her there.

16:45.653 --> 16:46.993
What can I do?

16:47.923 --> 16:49.983
I'll build a chapel in
exchange for her salvation.

16:49.993 --> 16:51.443
It's too late for that.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.253
All you can do is
save yourself now.

16:55.263 --> 16:56.263
How?

16:57.493 --> 16:58.493
I'll do anything.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.333
This isn't fair!

17:03.603 --> 17:07.123
No, it isn't. Very little
is fair in this life,

17:07.133 --> 17:08.673
and the forces
of evil are strong.

17:08.683 --> 17:09.943
And make no mistake about it.

17:09.953 --> 17:12.663
It's the devil we're fighting,
and the scores are even.

17:13.573 --> 17:15.583
But this is why I called you here.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.973
I have the authority
to appoint a district sheriff.

17:20.183 --> 17:21.733
What would you say
if I appointed you?

17:21.742 --> 17:23.752
I am not a sheriff.

17:24.823 --> 17:26.713
I am a lord.

17:27.893 --> 17:30.693
Don't try my patience, William.

17:31.993 --> 17:35.273
I will want you to make
an arrest for murder soon.

17:35.283 --> 17:37.533
Who? Who murdered whom?

17:38.173 --> 17:41.023
No one's murdered anyone, yet.

17:41.773 --> 17:42.993
I don't follow.

17:43.003 --> 17:44.733
No, I don't expect you to.

17:45.573 --> 17:47.043
Trust me, William.

17:47.053 --> 17:51.063
I'm laying a trap for a witch.

18:22.263 --> 18:23.263
Ma.

18:24.483 --> 18:25.713
What are you doing here?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.683
Why were you in the crypt?

18:28.223 --> 18:30.943
I'm retrieving an old
letter for a new friend.

18:33.053 --> 18:34.173
Trust me, Jack.

18:34.423 --> 18:36.063
I'm laying a trap for a bishop.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.223
Alfred! Brother, wake up.

18:46.273 --> 18:48.313
There's someone here
to see you. Wake up.

18:48.343 --> 18:49.483
Tell them I'm not well, Martha.

18:49.493 --> 18:51.443
You're well enough.
Now get on your feet.

18:51.453 --> 18:53.063
I'll bring some water so
you can wash your face.

18:53.073 --> 18:56.263
- Why? Who is it?
- It's Cardinal Waleran.

19:05.823 --> 19:07.993
- Your Eminence.
- Oh, do get up, Alfred.

19:08.653 --> 19:10.253
Did Martha offer
you something to eat?

19:10.263 --> 19:12.553
I have no time. I'm here
to grant you a favor.

19:13.263 --> 19:15.473
Is it the annulment?
Will I be able to marry again?

19:15.503 --> 19:18.073
Follow my wishes, you'll be
able to do whatever you want.

19:20.903 --> 19:22.573
What's that?
A dagger?

19:25.243 --> 19:26.413
What?

19:31.033 --> 19:33.713
I want you to provoke
Jack Jackson into a fight.

19:34.453 --> 19:35.483
You want me to kill him?

19:35.493 --> 19:37.933
No, of course not.
That would be murder.

19:39.403 --> 19:40.403
What then?

19:40.423 --> 19:43.593
I want you to make
Jackson spill some blood,

19:44.023 --> 19:45.023
yours.

19:45.513 --> 19:47.213
- My blood?
- If it's convenient.

19:47.223 --> 19:49.403
Just a few drops, nothing serious.

19:51.373 --> 19:52.373
Why?

19:52.473 --> 19:53.753
So I can have him arrested.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.793
I'll deal with the rest.

19:55.803 --> 19:56.803
Do this,

19:57.473 --> 20:00.163
I'll dissolve your marriage
and make you a free man.

20:00.173 --> 20:02.143
And you can marry whoever you want.

20:02.153 --> 20:04.923
Do you, um, have
a bride picked out?

20:05.373 --> 20:06.373
Several.

20:10.993 --> 20:12.553
Glad to be of service.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.413
ANJOU
France

20:19.363 --> 20:20.863
I'm returning to England...

20:22.733 --> 20:24.323
to fight for my rightful crown.

20:24.873 --> 20:27.703
Our soldiers are returning
from the crusade, Mother.

20:27.803 --> 20:28.663
They'll support me.

20:28.783 --> 20:30.703
- Henry...
- Don't you dare forbid it!

20:30.873 --> 20:33.333
I would be ashamed
if you didn't want this,

20:33.343 --> 20:35.373
but Father Francis here believes

20:35.383 --> 20:38.463
the crown can be won
with ink, not blood.

20:41.683 --> 20:45.053
Stephen is old and his son,
Eustace, weak and unpopular.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.683
Let me travel with you

20:51.333 --> 20:53.093
and try to negotiate a compromise.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.063
I don't believe in compromise.

20:56.513 --> 20:58.133
Compromise is for cowards.

20:58.503 --> 21:01.273
I spit in the face of fear.

21:03.603 --> 21:05.663
I'm assembling an army!

21:09.053 --> 21:09.643
<i>You done there?</i>

21:09.713 --> 21:11.443
<i>You have to go on your own.</i>

21:12.113 --> 21:13.873
The vault's cracking,
not because of the weight,

21:14.483 --> 21:15.873
but because of the height,

21:16.053 --> 21:17.353
because of the wind.

21:17.523 --> 21:18.523
I don't follow.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.273
Come. Here.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.093
This here, this is
the wall of the church.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.233
Now place your hand
flat across my fingers

21:26.243 --> 21:27.453
as if it were the roof.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.233
Right, now press down.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.193
So, as Euclid says,

21:32.233 --> 21:34.643
the wall of my arm
holds that weight.

21:34.773 --> 21:35.953
Now, instead of the roof,

21:36.203 --> 21:39.413
imagine your hand is the
wind blowing against my arm.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.183
Do you see?

21:44.043 --> 21:46.713
The vault's cracking
because the walls are moving.

21:47.293 --> 21:49.373
It's the wind
that's causing it.

21:49.453 --> 21:51.923
It's no coincidence that
I discovered the cracks

21:51.933 --> 21:53.253
on the night of the storm.

21:55.093 --> 21:56.333
Thank you, Elizabeth.

21:56.343 --> 21:58.243
Take this one instead.

21:58.493 --> 22:00.093
It's better than
the Italian fabric,

22:00.293 --> 22:01.903
and the color won't fade.

22:06.233 --> 22:08.413
You see, all these
parts, not just the walls,

22:08.433 --> 22:10.603
were meant to work together
to support the whole.

22:10.613 --> 22:12.133
It's like a team of workers.

22:12.473 --> 22:13.983
I learned this in France.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.853
Now, the wind is a new
force working against us.

22:16.863 --> 22:19.193
It wasn't as strong in Saint Denis.

22:20.053 --> 22:21.583
What we're looking for

22:22.363 --> 22:24.793
is a new part that's
not yet been invented.

22:25.453 --> 22:26.453
And look at the bird

22:27.693 --> 22:28.733
and follow me.

22:33.893 --> 22:35.973
<i>I'm heading out to
buy some flowers.</i>

22:36.363 --> 22:38.513
<i>Hey, look. Feel
that, feel that, eh?</i>

22:48.443 --> 22:50.813
So, it's a taller buttress,
at least 20 feet higher,

22:50.823 --> 22:52.663
but with these second half arches

22:53.233 --> 22:55.573
that leap across
to the exterior wall

22:55.583 --> 22:57.153
near where those
cracks are forming.

22:57.163 --> 22:59.733
So, it will brace the
top half of the church

22:59.923 --> 23:02.123
and keep these walls
rigid when the wind blows.

23:02.133 --> 23:05.873
But won't the higher
buttresses appear rather naked?

23:05.883 --> 23:08.493
Well, if we try and hide them
with more walls, we lose the light.

23:09.323 --> 23:11.463
What's wrong with
them appearing naked

23:11.513 --> 23:14.603
so long as they're strong and
elegant, like the bird's wing?

23:31.753 --> 23:33.233
Good morning, dear wife.

23:36.703 --> 23:38.553
Winged buttresses?

23:38.693 --> 23:39.503
- Exactly.
- Jack!

23:40.753 --> 23:42.163
It's Alfred, he's drunk again.

23:42.173 --> 23:43.443
I've never seen him so wild.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.353
What do you mean?

23:44.373 --> 23:45.563
He attacked Aliena.

23:49.323 --> 23:50.323
What happened?

23:55.163 --> 23:56.193
The arm, too.

23:57.673 --> 23:58.803
I've been worse.

24:03.573 --> 24:04.573
Jack!

24:07.453 --> 24:08.463
Alfred!

24:09.923 --> 24:10.923
Alfred!

24:12.453 --> 24:14.573
<i>Serves plenty! A pitcher now!</i>

24:14.413 --> 24:16.123
<i>Serves this many!</i>

24:51.523 --> 24:53.153
Bastard stabbed me!

24:53.833 --> 24:56.953
Everyone, Jack Bastard
stabbed me unprovoked!

24:57.063 --> 24:58.283
No, he attacked Aliena.

24:58.293 --> 24:59.833
She's my wife!

25:00.623 --> 25:03.533
My wife, sister, look what
Jack Bastard did to me.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.753
He scratched himself,
Aliena. It was his own knife.

25:05.763 --> 25:07.373
I've never seen it
before in my life!

25:07.753 --> 25:09.653
Why should I stab myself?

25:10.413 --> 25:13.033
It's Aliena I wanna stab,
and not with a knife.

25:21.493 --> 25:22.493
What?

25:38.373 --> 25:39.513
He tricked me!

25:39.533 --> 25:41.413
- What?
- It was poisoned.

25:42.663 --> 25:43.663
Dear God!

25:49.403 --> 25:51.463
- What is happening?
- I don't know. I don't know.

26:37.153 --> 26:39.853
For Maud, Queen of England!

27:04.813 --> 27:06.733
Eustace! Eustace!

27:06.743 --> 27:07.743
Yes?

27:08.363 --> 27:09.493
I'm Henry.

27:10.353 --> 27:11.963
Pleased to meet you, cousin.

27:17.313 --> 27:18.403
Dead?

27:19.073 --> 27:20.073
Not dead.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.833
My son is not dead.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.413
No!

27:31.063 --> 27:32.063
No!

27:32.713 --> 27:34.323
Your Majesty, no.

27:35.043 --> 27:36.853
Your Majesty!

27:37.743 --> 27:39.683
Your Majesty, please!

27:43.833 --> 27:46.753
Eustace, dear boy, you're alive!

27:47.693 --> 27:49.213
You're alive!

27:51.293 --> 27:53.743
No. No!

28:19.823 --> 28:20.943
What is the meaning of this?

28:20.953 --> 28:22.933
As newly appointed
district sheriff,

28:23.493 --> 28:24.913
I've come to arrest
Jack Jackson

28:24.923 --> 28:26.263
for the murder of Alfred Thomson.

28:26.393 --> 28:28.243
This cathedral
stands on holy ground.

28:28.253 --> 28:30.373
No arrest can be made
under the laws of sanctuary.

28:30.553 --> 28:32.633
Now take your men and
your horses and leave.

28:32.873 --> 28:34.643
Not so fast, good Prior.

28:34.943 --> 28:37.593
The laws of sanctuary
only apply to churches

28:37.603 --> 28:39.723
that have been
dedicated and sanctified.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.063
You should know that.

28:41.683 --> 28:43.333
This church is not yet finished,

28:43.343 --> 28:45.523
so God's law has no power here.

28:46.733 --> 28:48.083
Seize him.

28:52.613 --> 28:54.343
What would you know
of God's law?

28:54.793 --> 28:57.563
Your Church is a church of
ambition, not of Christ.

28:57.573 --> 29:00.033
Holy ambition which
brings me closer to Christ.

29:00.043 --> 29:01.713
Is that why
you burned my father?

29:01.723 --> 29:04.183
The Church did. I
just sentenced him.

29:04.193 --> 29:06.003
But Lord Percy and Prior James

29:06.013 --> 29:07.643
were under your
orders, weren't they?

29:07.653 --> 29:08.953
I was merely a priest.

29:08.963 --> 29:10.543
With connections in court!

29:11.313 --> 29:13.153
So, what did my father know?

29:13.803 --> 29:15.733
Was it something to
do with the White Ship?

29:15.743 --> 29:17.603
Gag him. Prepare for trial.

29:17.613 --> 29:19.573
Send for the executioner
from Winchester.

29:26.363 --> 29:29.063
Try to finish your cathedral now.

29:44.213 --> 29:45.773
Alfred Thomson was drunk.

29:46.043 --> 29:47.813
He attacked me in
the public square.

29:47.903 --> 29:48.943
As his wife.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.543
You publicly rejected him.

29:50.983 --> 29:52.823
His reaction was understandable.

29:52.933 --> 29:55.553
We haven't lived together as
husband and wife in nearly 10 years.

29:56.293 --> 29:59.153
All the more reason, I would
think, for his desperation, hmm?

30:02.243 --> 30:05.593
Did Jack Jackson
stab Alfred Thomson?

30:05.603 --> 30:07.043
The wound was not fatal.

30:07.053 --> 30:08.623
- It barely nicked his skin.
- Oh, not fatal?

30:08.633 --> 30:11.713
Perhaps your late husband
should testify to that.

30:14.573 --> 30:15.663
The dagger was poisoned.

30:15.673 --> 30:19.253
There are witnesses here who can
testify how Alfred Thomson died.

30:19.263 --> 30:22.823
Furthermore, the weapon belonged
neither to Alfred nor to Jack.

30:22.833 --> 30:25.433
This is mere quibbling.
Take the witness down.

30:35.523 --> 30:36.853
The facts are clear.

30:36.863 --> 30:38.983
Alfred Thomson died
from a stab wound

30:38.993 --> 30:41.613
administered by Jack Jackson,
who is hereby condemned

30:41.623 --> 30:43.083
to be hanged by
the neck until dead.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.903
And may God have mercy on his soul.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.343
Proceed with the execution.

30:46.373 --> 30:48.373
No! No! It was murder,

30:48.383 --> 30:51.223
but the one that poisoned the
dagger should hang, not Jack!

30:51.233 --> 30:53.683
Silence, woman. Silence!

30:55.133 --> 30:56.793
I have evidence!

30:57.413 --> 30:59.133
There is no need
for more evidence.

30:59.143 --> 31:00.823
The prisoner
has been condemned.

31:02.063 --> 31:03.073
Evidence

31:03.893 --> 31:06.113
of the murder
of a future king...

31:08.263 --> 31:09.663
of regicide.

31:12.063 --> 31:12.603
<i>What is she talking about?</i>

31:14.063 --> 31:16.343
<i>- She's a madwoman!
- She's lying to save her son.</i>

31:18.173 --> 31:19.403
That woman

31:19.753 --> 31:21.673
was condemned as a witch years ago

31:21.683 --> 31:23.013
and has evaded
the law ever since.

31:23.023 --> 31:25.093
So, we'll have two hangings today.

31:25.143 --> 31:27.013
Mother, run. Run!

31:27.033 --> 31:28.033
No.

31:28.543 --> 31:31.363
There's been too much running
from the law in Kingsbridge.

31:32.163 --> 31:33.593
I have the evidence here.

31:33.953 --> 31:35.703
Quiet! Let her speak!

31:36.423 --> 31:38.153
Evidence of treason.

31:38.623 --> 31:41.193
The chalice was planted
on Jacques Cherbourg

31:41.853 --> 31:44.893
at the request of Prior
James of Kingsbridge.

31:45.583 --> 31:49.433
He was tortured and
burned. An innocent man!

31:49.483 --> 31:52.073
This is nonsense,
total nonsense.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.113
This has nothing to
do with this trial.

31:55.323 --> 31:56.833
Seize the woman and
hang her right away.

31:56.843 --> 31:59.483
As prior of Kingsbridge, let
me remind Your Eminence...

31:59.493 --> 32:01.773
Let me remind you, Prior Philip.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.493
This is a trial for
murder, not treason.

32:04.503 --> 32:05.973
Let me remind you

32:06.393 --> 32:10.333
that you are on priory
land within priory walls.

32:10.373 --> 32:11.853
Let this woman speak.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.343
thirty five years ago,

32:31.373 --> 32:32.573
I found a man...

32:33.593 --> 32:36.253
Jack Jackson's father,
near drowned on a beach.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.963
He held a secret for the king.

32:39.953 --> 32:42.073
<i>And before he was
taken by his enemies,</i>

32:42.813 --> 32:47.093
<i>he asked me for quill,
paper, ink and sealing wax.</i>

32:47.363 --> 32:50.213
<i>I never saw his letter
until a few days ago.</i>

32:52.003 --> 32:55.073
When he was brought here
and stripped for torture,

32:55.313 --> 32:58.203
one of the monks discovered
it hidden in his clothing.

33:08.383 --> 33:10.473
<i>This monk concealed
what he found,</i>

33:10.953 --> 33:13.273
<i>certain that, if anyone
knew what he had read,</i>

33:14.023 --> 33:16.253
he too would be eliminated.

33:16.983 --> 33:17.983
This...

33:19.413 --> 33:22.093
is Jacques Cherbourg's story.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.623
<i>Jacques Cherbourg, who is he?</i>

33:24.363 --> 33:25.533
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:27.343 --> 33:28.463
"Your Majesty,

33:29.123 --> 33:31.913
"I was a jongleur hired
by young Prince William

33:31.973 --> 33:33.553
"to sail with him to England.

33:34.543 --> 33:37.213
<i>"The ship was set ablaze,
and people were drowning."</i>

33:37.233 --> 33:39.013
Help! Help!

33:39.443 --> 33:40.643
God save me!

33:40.653 --> 33:43.413
<i>"Being the only good swimmer,
I managed to stay afloat,</i>

33:43.423 --> 33:45.433
<i>"and saw the prince
and his bride</i>

33:45.703 --> 33:47.443
<i>"save themselves
in a rowboat,</i>

33:47.453 --> 33:51.313
<i>"along with Father Waleran
and Lord and Lady Hamleigh.</i>

33:52.223 --> 33:54.963
<i>"I was about to call
to the prince for help</i>

33:55.333 --> 33:57.023
<i>"when the
unthinkable happened."</i>

34:09.943 --> 34:11.672
Kill her, Percy!

34:29.083 --> 34:32.223
<i>"I tried to save him,
but it was too late.</i>

34:32.743 --> 34:33.943
<i>"His ring, however,</i>

34:34.743 --> 34:36.293
<i>"slipped off into my hand.</i>

34:39.033 --> 34:40.253
<i>"Your Majesty,</i>

34:40.263 --> 34:43.123
<i>"your son's ring is the
proof of what I saw.</i>

34:47.632 --> 34:49.713
"I swear to the
truth of these words

34:50.203 --> 34:52.043
"on my immortal soul.

34:53.023 --> 34:54.313
"Jacques Cherbourg."

34:54.853 --> 34:56.723
<i>- Murderer!
- It's the bishop!</i>

34:56.793 --> 34:58.393
<i>Hang the bishop!</i>

34:58.463 --> 34:59.493
<i>- Murderer!
- Murderer!</i>

35:00.063 --> 35:04.493
There is no proof this
is anything but a forgery.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.423
He sealed it with
the lost prince's ring.

35:07.443 --> 35:09.443
Another forgery, another lie.

35:09.453 --> 35:11.743
He gave me the ring
for safekeeping,

35:11.753 --> 35:12.923
and I gave it to Jack.

35:13.343 --> 35:15.473
And Alfred stole it!

35:16.343 --> 35:18.343
So, there is no ring.
There is no ring!

35:18.643 --> 35:19.643
Pity,

35:19.653 --> 35:21.933
it might have given a glint
of truth to your story.

35:21.943 --> 35:25.063
- Proceed with the execution.
- No! No!

35:26.153 --> 35:27.103
- No!
- It's here!

35:28.993 --> 35:29.993
Martha.

35:43.073 --> 35:44.763
I took it from Jack years ago.

35:45.763 --> 35:47.543
<i>Because he said
it was worthless,</i>

35:49.013 --> 35:50.053
<i>and I thought
it was pretty.</i>

35:51.903 --> 35:54.193
He accused Alfred
of stealing it.

35:55.363 --> 35:57.293
<i>When I tried to
tell him differently,</i>

35:58.553 --> 36:00.273
<i>I grew afraid.</i>

36:04.293 --> 36:05.853
I kept it, Jack...

36:08.063 --> 36:10.163
because you loved Aliena so and...

36:12.343 --> 36:13.973
I wanted a little bit of you

36:14.373 --> 36:15.373
for myself.

36:17.503 --> 36:18.863
This proves nothing.

36:20.233 --> 36:22.153
It proves, once again,

36:22.233 --> 36:25.423
that the citizens of Kingsbridge
have been used unlawfully

36:25.443 --> 36:27.653
by Bishop Waleran
and William Hamleigh.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.873
You've attacked
this town twice,

36:30.403 --> 36:32.793
killing our husbands,
our wives, our children.

36:32.803 --> 36:34.213
And now you attack again

36:34.533 --> 36:35.513
by murdering the one man

36:35.523 --> 36:37.353
that has brought
this town back to life.

36:39.493 --> 36:41.563
No! You will not touch her!

36:54.743 --> 36:56.053
Burn in hell!

36:57.373 --> 36:58.983
Hang the two!

37:00.813 --> 37:02.443
It's not me!
It's not me!

37:04.363 --> 37:06.563
It's the bishop! It's Waleran!

37:06.593 --> 37:09.693
- He set me on to it.
-Silence! Silence!

37:10.103 --> 37:11.553
Allow him to be heard.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.973
He was
Prince William's confessor,

37:14.263 --> 37:15.293
and Stephen's.

37:15.563 --> 37:17.393
He went to Stephen
and made a bargain.

37:17.983 --> 37:19.293
<i>With Prince William dead,</i>

37:19.443 --> 37:21.883
Stephen would be
in direct line to the throne.

37:22.003 --> 37:23.893
He recruited my parents to help.

37:24.393 --> 37:25.503
And together, they
scuttled the ship

37:26.153 --> 37:28.643
and murdered the
prince and his wife.

37:28.693 --> 37:31.093
For this, my parents were
given land and position,

37:31.103 --> 37:33.283
but he did it for power.

37:33.423 --> 37:34.503
But I did nothing.

37:34.513 --> 37:35.983
As God is my witness,

37:35.993 --> 37:37.213
I did nothing.

37:39.573 --> 37:41.623
I don't want to die!

37:45.493 --> 37:46.493
Let go of me!

38:12.583 --> 38:14.333
Citizens of Kingsbridge...

38:15.813 --> 38:19.273
you have brought the wrath
of God upon yourselves.

38:20.023 --> 38:21.753
You harbor liars,

38:22.693 --> 38:23.693
witches,

38:24.233 --> 38:26.303
sodomites and thieves.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.973
And unholy priests!

38:35.243 --> 38:37.043
Because of your treachery,

38:37.123 --> 38:40.393
England has been steeped
in blood for sixteen years.

38:41.723 --> 38:42.953
Soldiers have died,

38:43.573 --> 38:45.173
wives mourned,

38:45.623 --> 38:47.873
sons grown fatherless into manhood

38:47.883 --> 38:50.123
and then gone themselves
to fight and to die.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.273
This town has been burned,

38:55.083 --> 38:56.903
its citizens slaughtered...

38:58.803 --> 39:00.633
and yet, still we survive.

39:00.843 --> 39:05.123
We build a cathedral like
none has ever seen before

39:05.133 --> 39:07.923
in praise of God and our abilities

39:08.253 --> 39:09.643
and our faith

39:09.973 --> 39:11.203
in some peaceful tomorrow.

39:11.213 --> 39:13.773
And in spite
of you, Waleran Bigod,

39:14.343 --> 39:17.533
the people of Kingsbridge
will find that peace.

39:20.553 --> 39:21.533
Take hold of that man!

39:38.503 --> 39:40.153
I claim sanctuary!

39:40.173 --> 39:42.543
I am your bishop
and this is holy ground.

39:42.553 --> 39:45.653
There is no sanctuary,
you said so yourself.

39:46.113 --> 39:47.583
<i>He spilled our blood!</i>

40:14.103 --> 40:15.053
<i>There he is!</i>

40:15.073 --> 40:16.573
<i>There's Waleran!</i>

41:09.693 --> 41:11.293
<i>There he is!</i>

41:54.863 --> 41:56.313
<i>- No, Jack!
- No, Jack!</i>

42:19.903 --> 42:23.443
And you, you shall one
day climb very high...

42:24.673 --> 42:26.053
only to fall.

43:00.353 --> 43:02.523
<i>Ego te absolvo.</i>

44:17.353 --> 44:20.083
<i>When we began work on
the Kingsbridge Cathedral,</i>

44:20.383 --> 44:21.863
<i>King Stephen was newly crowned,</i>

44:21.873 --> 44:24.293
<i>and the Princess
Maud fled to France</i>

44:24.543 --> 44:26.563
<i>with her newborn son, Henry.</i>

44:27.233 --> 44:31.603
<i>For years, England was torn
by war and great suffering.</i>

44:32.303 --> 44:33.973
<i>King Stephen is since dead,</i>

44:34.343 --> 44:37.883
<i>and Maud's son now rules
as King Henry II of England.</i>

44:39.293 --> 44:42.453
<i>Now we have peace and
hope for a bright tomorrow.</i>

44:43.143 --> 44:45.973
<i>And for these gifts
and our beautiful church,</i>

44:46.553 --> 44:50.433
<i>I thank God, our king,
the people of Kingsbridge</i>

44:50.983 --> 44:54.453
<i>and several generations
of tireless workers.</i>

44:56.103 --> 44:58.353
<i>But the cathedral
is not finished</i>

44:59.323 --> 45:00.703
<i>and nor will it ever be.</i>

45:02.653 --> 45:04.033
<i>Just as human perfection is</i>

45:04.043 --> 45:05.983
<i>something we all strive for</i>

45:06.393 --> 45:07.373
<i>and can never attain,</i>

45:07.533 --> 45:09.933
<i>so this church will
forever be changing,</i>

45:10.023 --> 45:11.023
<i>growing,</i>

45:11.373 --> 45:12.833
<i>crumbling at times...</i>

45:13.933 --> 45:17.563
an ongoing legacy of our
feeble efforts to touch God.

45:18.033 --> 45:20.123
A cathedral, my friends, is...

45:20.433 --> 45:22.373
is neither stone nor statues

45:22.513 --> 45:23.943
nor even a place of prayer.

45:23.953 --> 45:25.213
It is...

45:25.723 --> 45:27.753
a continuum of creation...

45:29.253 --> 45:31.053
beautiful work,

45:31.313 --> 45:33.333
that pray God will never end.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.103
And, as one final
note of grace, I...

45:38.603 --> 45:39.883
Need I point this out?

45:40.363 --> 45:42.763
Jack has finished the...

45:43.993 --> 45:48.843
windows with, whoever
heard of it, colored glass.

45:50.173 --> 45:52.403
He filled
this world with light.

45:52.773 --> 45:54.473
God be praised.
