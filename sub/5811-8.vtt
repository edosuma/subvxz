00:02.160 --> 00:03.446
Previously on Arrow and Flash...

00:03.640 --> 00:04.926
- Thanks, mister.
- Yeah.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.923
Barry said that you need our help.
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.208
Give her to me
and I'll make your death fast.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.801
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.286
An Immortal.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.485
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.286
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die, we reincarnate.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.686
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.450
In every lifetime, he hunts us down.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.126
<i>We think he's trying
to locate the Staff of Horus.</i>

00:33.320 --> 00:35.800
I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.880
No!

00:40.120 --> 00:41.326
<i>Shay-Ara...</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:58.364
Prince Khufu, my son,
what have you come to offer?

00:59.800 --> 01:04.361
Father, we bring this tribute to the
protector of all we see and know, Horus.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.801
Praise be upon him.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.328
It is a fine offering, Khufu,
a feast worthy of a god.

01:09.640 --> 01:13.087
And yet, Priestess Chay-Ara
does not seem to agree.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.245
Your offering is lovely, my prince.
If not a bit naive.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.766
Naive?

01:22.720 --> 01:26.725
To think that Horus would
be appeased by trifles.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.564
The portents of his dissatisfaction
grow with each passing day.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.367
The celestial rocks used to fall
once a generation.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.443
Now they strike
with each phase of the moon.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.003
I thought it was your job to keep
Horus in a good mood, Priestess.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.122
Priestess Chay-Ara only speaks
out of concern for all.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.122
Otherwise, she would remain
a bit more polite.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.401
We have warned you, time and again,
of the sky rocks and the threat they pose

01:51.600 --> 01:56.242
to the court of Ramesses the Wise.
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.883
Prayers and trifles will not
be enough to stop them.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.570
Priestess!
You spoke with quite the tongue in there.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.405
Did I over-act?

02:10.720 --> 02:12.722
No. I love your tongue.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.726
You Okay?

02:24.880 --> 02:26.882
Yeah. I'm fine. I just have a headache.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.801
Are you sure? Usually, that's a sign
of your memories returning.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.921
Yeah, I'm sure.
I can't remember anything yet.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.569
A bunch of superheroes in a farmhouse?

02:42.400 --> 02:43.640
Feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.251
We need a secure location.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.401
What's wrong with S.T.A.R. Labs?

02:46.600 --> 02:47.840
Well, I mean, absolutely nothing,

02:48.080 --> 02:49.764
if you forget about
the revolving door you guys installed

02:49.960 --> 02:51.610
so the bad guys can
come and go as they please.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.768
Remind me again
what happened to your old lair?

02:53.960 --> 02:54.961
Or the one before that?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.771
Well, lair number one was
compromised by the police.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.487
And I will stop helping.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.127
Savage only let Barry
and I live because he felt Kendra

03:03.280 --> 03:05.203
start to emerge as Hawkgirl
and went after her.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.124
He can sense her and Carter's presence.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.521
We don't need to make it easier
on him by staying in the city limits.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.683
Bet you wish you stayed at
your mother's place now.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.330
We need to find a way to neutralize
Savage's advantage. Barry, you're late.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.444
Sorry. it turns out it's not easy
finding the ass-end of nowhere.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.451
Yeah, for real. The roaming charges alone
are going to bankrupt me.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.842
We're discussing how to take away
Savage's new-found power.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.326
His magic stick thing.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.801
Uh, Staff of Horus.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.450
Well, it's protected by
some kind of energy field.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.842
- I couldn't lay a finger on it.
- Maybe wear mittens next time.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.008
What if we made some sort of
insulated gauntlets?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.647
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The magnetic shielding could disrupt the...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.643
- Staff's magnetic polarity.
- Yeah.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.848
- Well, while the geek squad works...
<i>- Heard that,</i> honey.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.804
While they work to get
the staff away from Savage,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.048
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.570
Well, I googled "reincarnated nutjobs"
and came up with nothing.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.003
Uh, Kendra and I would be the reincarnated
nutjobs. Savage is merely immortal.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.248
- Merely?
- Welcome to the new normal.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.323
Anyone who's been around
for 4,000 years should leave a trail.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.363
I'll check with A.R.G.U.S.
See if they have anything on him.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.767
Uh, Laurel and I can check
police reports and stuff like that.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.243
Good. We need to find a way to
utilize your new ability.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.488
- My ability?
- It might give us an advantage.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.563
Yeah. Whatever you do,
don't let him train you.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.764
I'm sorry, but when it rains, I can still
feel where you shot me with those arrows.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.331
I'll handle her training then.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.369
- Yeah.
- Oliver.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.410
I need to run something down.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.242
And what exactly are you running down?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.441
Don't worry. It's nothing dangerous.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.920
Well, are you okay?

04:27.440 --> 04:30.444
Well, we're up against an immortal madman
armed with a magical staff,

04:30.680 --> 04:32.205
so I do have a few things on my mind.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.688
Yeah, but you were acting fine
with everything while we were home.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.726
And now that we're here in Central City,
you've just been not you.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.929
Well, maybe it's too bright
and sunny for me here.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.882
There is something going on,
and I'm going to tell you all about it.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.204
I would just like the chance to know
what I'm dealing with first.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.801
Okay.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.246
Okay.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.246
Hey! You must be going
through a lot right now.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.728
Yeah. You know, we should talk.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.086
Never in the history of romance have those
words ever meant anything good.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.244
I just mean we should probably talk
about everything that's happened.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.647
That's happening.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.884
You know what? I'm gonna suggest something
radical here and say let's not talk.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.963
Look, you got a lot
on your plate right now,

05:15.160 --> 05:17.447
and I just don't want to be that piece
of very nutritious broccoli

05:17.640 --> 05:19.290
that you scrape off the plate
to give to the dog.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.406
My point being, I don't think you can
afford to be distracted right now.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.481
Let's go.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.409
Yes. Let's.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.610
Sorry, buddy. This is private.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.970
- Private?
- Yep.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.929
I'm just gonna go do some
push-ups over there.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.606
Open it.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.962
Why? What's inside?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.080
Something we have to track down
in each of our incarnations.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.601
Sometimes, I find it.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.689
Sometimes, you find me
and we go look for it together.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.285
Four thousand years, 206 lives, we've seen
about every combination there is.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.961
I don't think I'm really...

06:10.120 --> 06:12.964
Ready for this.
You say that in every lifetime.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.161
Look, as you emerge, as your memories
come back to you, so will other things.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.726
Skills. Languages.
Pieces of your prior lives.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.406
There you go.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.685
Oh, this is nuts.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.247
It's okay. I'll help you through it.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.881
Yeah, well, the last time you "helped" me,
I got pushed off a building.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.521
Yes, and after that, you, uh,
you soared, if I remember correctly.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.484
And that is because
anger, fear, adrenaline,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.047
those are the things
that bring out the warrior within.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.209
Well, according to Savage,
I'm a priestess.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.486
The clergy were warriors. Warrior priests.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.571
And that is the side that you
need to remember.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.490
And if I can't?

06:52.320 --> 06:56.564
Well, then we'll, uh,
both probably die. Again.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.170
- SAMANTHAI Today?
- WILLIAMI Yeah.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.880
- All right, let's not be late.
- Okay.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.126
Thank you.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.366
Oliver?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.051
Hi.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.130
Uh, hold on one second.
What are you doing here?

07:22.520 --> 07:24.409
I'm so sorry to just drop by unannounced.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.564
I came to town the other day,
and I saw, I saw you with your son.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.241
William.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.727
William? That's a nice name.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.451
Oliver, what are you doing at my house?

07:33.760 --> 07:36.081
I saw you and William together, and I...

07:36.280 --> 07:39.204
It's difficult
not to wonder because...

07:40.800 --> 07:44.566
He's what, nine? And, you know,
we had our thing 10 years ago.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.285
- Okay, let me stop you right there.
- All right.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.042
William isn't yours.
I told you, I lost our baby, Oliver.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.561
Yes.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.122
And I met William's father two months
after moving to Central City, so...

07:55.600 --> 07:57.409
Mom, we're gonna miss the game!

07:58.600 --> 08:00.443
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- No, go.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.006
Okay.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.646
Oh!

08:03.920 --> 08:05.126
Here you are.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.160
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.731
Wish William good luck for me, all right?

08:09.080 --> 08:10.320
I will.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.251
Now is not a good time, Malcolm.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.484
I've arranged a meeting with
Vandal Savage. You, me and the speedster.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.450
What? Wait, why...

08:28.800 --> 08:31.690
Because negotiation is the only
way out of this situation, Oliver.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.448
Savage is going to decimate
Central City to get what he wants.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.922
If your child were here,
you would understand.

08:38.159 --> 08:41.607
<i>Suit up. I've already spoke with
fleet feet. He's on his way.</i>

08:55.280 --> 08:58.489
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.724
Yeah. Well, your friend with
the creepy ring asked so nicely.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.049
Please tell me we're not going to
negotiate with terrorists.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.290
Or, you know, 4,000-year-old bad guys.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.170
Just think of this more
as a fact-finding mission.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.890
Maybe Savage slips up
and gives us something

09:11.120 --> 09:12.360
that we can use to our advantage.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.007
Thea said you were being
a little bit more humorous lately.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.641
I'm sorry. How do you know
so much about Savage, anyway?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.207
I don't know anything about him,
Mr. Allen. No one does.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.165
That is why I'm afraid of him.

09:22.400 --> 09:27.167
That's not the only reason to be
afraid of me. I assure you.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.328
- Thank you for joining me.
- What do you want?

09:40.520 --> 09:43.888
What all living things want. Not to die.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.003
I thought that wasn't a problem for you.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.602
Only if I take the life force from
Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.240
Kendra and Carter.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.401
The three of us are locked in a vicious
circle played out over thousands of years.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.771
None of your concern.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.240
We've made it our concern.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.730
Robin of Locksley.
I taught him how to use a bow.

10:13.400 --> 10:18.247
He taught me how to not feel pain.
I'm the enemy you can't defeat.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.771
The only way for you
and yours to live through this

10:21.960 --> 10:24.042
is to render unto me what is mine.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.487
Turn over Prince Khufu and
Priestess Chay-Ara within 24 hours,

10:28.720 --> 10:32.964
or I will lay waste to this city,
killing everyone that you hold dear.

10:34.640 --> 10:39.601
And after that, I will travel to
your home and do the same thing there.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.042
All right, I'm just curious, did you
rehearse that speech in a mirror

10:42.280 --> 10:44.282
this morning or is this all
just off the cuff?

10:48.320 --> 10:52.723
Why would you risk the lives of
your friends and family for two strangers?

10:53.480 --> 10:56.324
Two hundred and six times
I have killed them.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.403
What hubris possesses you that makes you
think that you can prevent me

11:00.600 --> 11:02.090
from doing so again?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.162
Nothubfls.Hope.

11:05.760 --> 11:10.243
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.163
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

11:14.520 --> 11:18.684
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.929
We're not giving up Kendra and Carter.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.451
That's not your decision to make.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.371
This is a cycle that has played out
for the last 4,000 years.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.649
Savage may be immortal,
but he isn't a god.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.446
- No. But he's the next best thing. Oliver.
- What?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.964
You better be certain that
your stubbornness

11:38.120 --> 11:39.531
does not get my daughter killed.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.969
Because if that happens,
I will come for you,

11:43.320 --> 11:46.881
and in a way that will make you beg
for the likes of Vandal Savage.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.280
<i>Twenty-four hours.</i>

11:50.560 --> 11:51.721
Until what?

11:51.960 --> 11:55.203
Until we are supposed to hand you
and Carter over to Savage or...

11:55.480 --> 11:58.006
- Savage lays waste to Central City.
- Yep.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.851
We've been through this before.
1887, The Huang He flood,

12:01.040 --> 12:03.520
Savage killed nearly two million people
to get to us. And he did.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.564
We weren't helping you then. We are now.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.484
We have 24 hours to come up
with a workable plan.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.407
No, this is insane. My life isn't worth
millions of people's lives.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.246
- Kendra... I'll talk to her.
- Yeah.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.801
Hey, I got this.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.331
I said I'll talk to her.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.762
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't we just
toss him over to Vandal Savage?

12:23.840 --> 12:25.001
- Where were you?
- Hey.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.845
You missed the whole save the city
or turn my girlfriend over

12:28.040 --> 12:29.485
to an immortal psychopath briefing.

12:29.720 --> 12:33.441
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um, dude,
I... Last night, I, um, I ghosted.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.841
No.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.729
- Yeah. I think I'm gonna...
- Don't say it.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.730
- I think I'm going to time jump...
- I just told you not to say it!

12:40.920 --> 12:42.365
I'm sorry. I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.006
Barry, the first rule of time travel is
you don't talk about time travel!

12:45.240 --> 12:47.242
Because by having this conversation,
we're screwing history.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.602
Look, I know that time travel
has consequences.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.205
I mean, the last time you vibed...

12:51.360 --> 12:55.126
Well, I'm not vibing anything right now.
Okay, urn, all right, look, don't panic.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.408
A, you don't know that you
time-jumped for a bad reason.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.285
It could have been a good one, right?
B, now that you know you time-jumped,

13:00.520 --> 13:05.208
you might not do it, right? So, knowing
the future might change the present,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.363
which might change the future.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.040
What?

13:10.360 --> 13:11.805
My head hurts.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.247
Chay-Ara! Sorry. Kendra.
You shouldn't run off.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.881
- We don't know if Savage is...
- Do we ever kill ourselves?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.441
Excuse me?

13:18.640 --> 13:22.042
In our prior lives. Savage has to kill us
in order to live forever.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.647
Do we ever kill ourselves
in order to deny him that?

13:25.560 --> 13:28.404
You know, in our past lives, I'm typically
the one that makes the plans.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.490
And I'm starting to think
this is probably why.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.082
Everyone in there is willing
to die to protect us.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.568
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

13:37.800 --> 13:42.840
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.164
Yeah, well, heroes or not,
I'm not letting anyone die for me.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.926
Then don't.

13:50.160 --> 13:54.165
Be the person, the woman,
the warrior you were meant to be.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.844
The one you always have been.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.449
- Come at me.
- What?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.524
Hit me or, or try to.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.489
Yeah, well, as much as
I'd like to do that,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.808
I'm really not in the mood right now.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.810
Oh, really? Well, I'll just tell Savage
to come back when you are.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.886
Again.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.846
Again.

14:40.720 --> 14:46.124
Good. Do you feel that? The rage?
That's the key, Kendra.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.723
<i>It's the only way of finding
the warrior within.</i>

14:48.960 --> 14:50.200
Hey.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.964
Sorry to interrupt the weirdness.

14:54.320 --> 14:57.164
Um, John, Laurel and Thea are back,
and they've got something.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.486
Where are Oliver and Barry?

14:59.680 --> 15:01.250
Oliver's back in secret-keeping mode,
apparently.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.370
Barry, I don't know. Caitlin and Cisco
are working on the anti-Staff gauntlets.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.925
What do you guys have?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.040
Betamax. Aw. Where'd you get this?
Off of eBay?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.321
Lyla hooked us up.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.561
Yeah, well, it's gonna
take a while to play,

15:12.840 --> 15:14.046
since we live in a digital world now.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.041
The tape came from a conspiracy theory
group that's interested in Savage.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.765
The Pentagon had a file
on Savage back in '86,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.604
but it's all been heavily redacted.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.046
Got it.

15:23.240 --> 15:28.770
<i>Is this on? I hope so.
My name is Dr. Aldus Boardman.</i>

15:29.160 --> 15:34.849
<i>I'm a professor at St. Roch University.
The date is April 8th, 1975.</i>

15:35.760 --> 15:40.209
<i>I don't think anyone else knows this.
And those that do don't believe.</i>

15:40.520 --> 15:43.046
<i>He's a myth. An urban legend.</i>

15:43.240 --> 15:47.564
<i>He's been compared to Machiavelli and
Nostradamus. He's gone by many names.</i>

15:48.040 --> 15:52.523
<i>But I know him as Vandal Savage,
and he will be the death of the world.</i>

15:53.640 --> 15:55.290
<i>But I believe there is a way to stop him.</i>

15:55.760 --> 15:59.207
<i>Savage is an immortal Egyptian priest.</i>

15:59.880 --> 16:03.362
<i>His long life is the result
of an unearthly calamity.</i>

16:04.040 --> 16:08.329
<i>I believe that any object associated
with this calamity should be able to</i>

16:08.560 --> 16:10.562
<i>undo its effects and kill him.</i>

16:11.120 --> 16:16.251
<i>And I suspect that our precious,
fragile world may one day depend upon us</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:17.766
<i>doing so.</i>

16:18.720 --> 16:20.484
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.085
Or, you know, the last 4,000 years.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.404
You have any idea what he meant
by these objects? This calamity?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.768
No, I don't recall a calamity.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.083
- The staff.
- The Staff of Horus?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.563
Yes. I think the staff belonged
to Savage back in ancient Egypt.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.560
You remember?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.330
It's a hunch.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.602
And if Professor Boardman's
guess is right,

16:39.800 --> 16:41.848
that staff is how we kill Savage.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.682
Okay, someone needs to inform
Oliver and Barry.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.371
Okay. Here you go.
I gene-sequenced the hair strand

16:50.600 --> 16:52.125
with the blood sample you gave me.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.364
Still not sure what it has to do with
Damien Darhk, but the Y chromosomes match.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.445
Are you okay?

17:01.280 --> 17:02.520
Thanks for this. It's a big help.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.000
Yeah. You're wel...

17:04.760 --> 17:06.046
- Barry.
- Yeah?

17:06.280 --> 17:07.884
Don't tell anyone about this.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.522
All right.
I'd like to know what's going on here.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.040
- Felicity...
- Yes, I tracked you down.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.281
I find people for a living.
Actually, I don't get paid...

17:16.480 --> 17:17.810
What was that?

17:18.680 --> 17:19.681
What was what?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.211
You just super-speeded
something into your pocket.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.646
Oh. Um, no, nothing.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.169
Um, well, actually, it's, um, it's
something Oliver wanted me to track down.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.642
- It's about Damien Darhk, I think.
- I want to see it.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.046
Why?

17:32.320 --> 17:33.481
Because you don't want me to see it.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.728
- I'm sorry. Oliver specifically asked me...
- Show me.

17:35.960 --> 17:40.204
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is.
It's just a DNA test.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.366
No, it's not.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.369
Honey, why don't you finish that inside?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.244
Mom, Flash hasn't saved the city yet.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.845
Now, honey.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.686
Can we talk?

18:05.920 --> 18:08.082
Look, I don't know what you're trying
to accomplish here, Oliver.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.685
I know, Samantha.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.003
I know that William is my son.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.089
- Okay.
- Why didn't you tell me?

18:20.360 --> 18:25.048
Okay, just keep your voice down.
Your mother told me not to.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.600
What?

18:27.040 --> 18:30.089
She offered me a million dollars
to tell you that I miscarried.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.370
My mother was a complicated person,
but she would never do that.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.210
Wait here.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.486
Here.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.726
Inevercashedit

18:55.120 --> 18:58.249
I didn't need her money to know
I didn't want her anywhere near my child.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.891
Or me anywhere near him.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.130
So, what? He can be just like his dad?

19:03.400 --> 19:06.609
Punching out paparazzi and
getting young girls knocked up?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.484
Samantha, I'm not that person anymore.

19:08.720 --> 19:12.441
I know. I know you're running for mayor.
Your mother was killed.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.722
Your friend Tommy.
You're a different person now,

19:14.960 --> 19:18.282
but can you really tell me
that your life is any less crazy?

19:18.760 --> 19:20.762
Can you honestly say
that William isn't better off

19:20.920 --> 19:23.161
with your world kept away from his?

19:23.440 --> 19:27.411
You know, you're right. I'm being selfish,
but I want an opportunity

19:27.680 --> 19:30.081
to get to know my son.
And I think that a young boy deserves

19:30.240 --> 19:32.322
the opportunity to get to know his father.

19:32.600 --> 19:37.128
Look, he's happy. He's well-adjusted.
I don't want to run the risk of him

19:37.440 --> 19:39.602
getting sucked into your orbit.
That can't happen.

19:39.840 --> 19:45.131
Which means that he can't know that
you're his father. And nobody else can.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.363
I don't care if that sounds harsh.
I'm his mother,

19:47.600 --> 19:51.810
and I will do whatever
I feel I have to do to protect him.

19:52.600 --> 19:57.049
Samantha, there is someone in my life now.
Please, don't make me keep this from her.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.205
Oliver, you will if you want
a relationship with my son.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.282
These are my conditions.
You've already asked the world of me.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.647
I'm just asking for the same in return.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.526
Everyone's waiting for you.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.803
Sorry, just something
I had to take care of.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.646
So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.162
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

20:26.880 --> 20:30.202
I think Damien Darhk has
someone operating in Central City.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.570
So I sent Barry to run down a lead.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.810
This kind of lead?

20:38.680 --> 20:40.011
He didn't know what he was giving me.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.369
But I've run enough tests on your blood
to recognize your DNA sequence anywhere.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.687
You don't know...

20:44.880 --> 20:47.486
You had him run
a paternity test, didn't you?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.330
- Look, Felicity...
- Stop!

20:54.840 --> 20:56.524
I cannot hear another lie!

20:58.520 --> 21:00.841
- It's more complicated than that.
- God, Oliver,

21:01.080 --> 21:03.003
you are the only person on this planet

21:03.280 --> 21:05.362
who considers the truth "complicated."

21:05.920 --> 21:08.764
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.731
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.849
I care that you lied to me just now.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.606
Do you know that my whole world
just exploded?

21:17.120 --> 21:22.524
And I think that I'm entitled to a minute
to process that by myself.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.724
You somehow managed to go
to C.C.P.D. and track down Barry.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.130
You didn't keep it to yourself.
You kept it from me.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.725
When were you planning on telling me?

21:31.120 --> 21:32.360
I don't know.

21:35.360 --> 21:41.811
If you loved me, if you trusted me,
telling me this wouldn't be such a burden.

21:42.040 --> 21:47.410
It would be a relief.
But you don't trust me.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.644
You never will.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.486
And how can I be with someone
who doesn't trust me?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.446
Felicity...

22:02.240 --> 22:04.004
Are you guys Okay?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.605
Oliver? What happened?

22:07.080 --> 22:08.320
Nothing. I'm fine.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.847
Are you sure? I mean, you don't seem fine.
You seem out of it.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.605
Is everyone inside?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.406
Yeah.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.969
We're coming up on Savage's deadline.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.161
Where's Felicity?

22:23.360 --> 22:24.771
- Are the gauntlets working?
- They're gonna have to be.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.160
- We're out of time.
- I think they'll work.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.762
<i>That staff's</i> gonna <i>go from
Can't Touch This</i> to <i>Invisible Touch.</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:33.602
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access to her full abilities,

22:33.760 --> 22:36.331
which makes you our ace in the hole.
We're gonna put you up against Savage.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.046
You attack with the element of surprise.
I will lay down cover fire.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.327
Barry, you speed in and...

22:40.520 --> 22:42.602
- Snatch the staff. I got it.
- Where do you need us?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.809
This is me, Barry, Kendra and Carter.
We've got it.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.047
- Ollie!
- No. We're not risking any more

22:48.280 --> 22:50.123
lives tonight than we have to.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.566
Suit up.

23:02.960 --> 23:07.329
You brought them.
And dressed for the occasion, I see.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.649
We're only doing this because
two lives aren't worth two cities.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.890
Well, in that case, you are wiser
than I gave you credit for.

23:17.560 --> 23:22.487
It's been a lifetime. Still wearing
those ridiculous outfits, I see.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.842
You don't need to be here for this.

23:27.040 --> 23:32.001
The culling has a tendency
to be unsightly.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.609
<i>Your new friends betrayed you.</i>

23:35.840 --> 23:37.330
Just do what you're going to do.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.002
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.089
I will never be your love.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.370
I know.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.886
Hmm.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.684
That always makes this easier.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.684
Chay-Ara, parting is such sweet sorrow.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.086
Now, Kendra!

24:24.040 --> 24:25.280
Carter!

24:42.560 --> 24:45.564
I've got it!
The gauntlet's aren't working!

24:50.560 --> 24:51.800
Let go, Barry!

24:52.000 --> 24:53.240
No, I'm not leaving you.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.086
You're fast enough to get away. Go!

24:56.760 --> 24:57.966
Ollie, no.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.808
Run, Barry, run.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.488
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

25:54.440 --> 25:58.684
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.607
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

26:02.800 --> 26:06.964
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.651
Barry, you all right?

26:22.840 --> 26:25.650
We need to brief the team.
Come up with some type of counter attack.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.005
It's not gonna work.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.725
What?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.361
Nothing, all right. Never mind.
I shouldn't have said anything. l...

26:33.680 --> 26:34.806
Hey, what's going on?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.367
Okay, look. This isn't going to make
any sense to you, but I...

26:37.560 --> 26:40.803
All right, so I traveled back in time
from when we tried to take out Savage.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.561
I mean, later, when we try
to take him down, in the future,

26:44.800 --> 26:46.529
and it doesn't work.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.047
You're right.
That doesn't make sense to me.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.521
My world is stranger than yours.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.688
Well, maybe we use that to our advantage.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.368
You say that whatever we do
against Savage doesn't work?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.483
- Yeah.
- Then we come up with a new plan.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.370
No. No, no, no.
Okay, look, you can't.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.524
When I mess with time,
it just... it doesn't end well.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.246
But what you're telling is
that it already doesn't end well.

27:06.520 --> 27:09.888
Barry, people in our line of work,
we don't get second chances.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.326
We need to take this one.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.006
All right. I hope you're right.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.244
All right.
Let's start with what went wrong.

27:16.200 --> 27:20.444
You did. When we go up against Savage,
your head's not in the game.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.364
- You're not yourself.
- Why not?

27:22.720 --> 27:25.291
- Oliver, I...
- Barry, why not?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.763
Okay, are you planning on
giving me a hair sample

27:30.040 --> 27:31.724
to run forensics on in the near future?

27:32.720 --> 27:33.721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.447
Well, I did. And you were
pretty shaken after the fact.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.809
And then Felicity found out.
And you guys had a pretty big fight,

27:41.040 --> 27:42.565
and it sounded like it was over
between you two.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.086
What was the fight about?

27:47.600 --> 27:50.251
I'm pretty sure you're
someone's father, Oliver.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.886
So when we go up against Savage,
you're not focused.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.287
And then Kendra can't access her powers

27:59.600 --> 28:03.286
and then the tech they're developing to
counteract Savages staff does not work.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.929
Everyone dies, Oliver.

28:08.440 --> 28:12.240
This time, they won't.
This time, we do things differently.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.281
How're they coming?

28:19.480 --> 28:23.565
For my first pair of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves, pretty good, I think.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.131
Yeah, just double and triple check, okay?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.009
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.446
Based on what?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.130
Call it a gut instinct.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.645
Also, I need you to talk to Kendra.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.801
Oh, I get it. You shoot arrows,
you give love tips.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.491
It's like you're Cupid or something.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.444
What Carter is doing with her
isn't working.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.085
We need her power to fight Savage,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.482
and we need her
to be able to use it reliably.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.009
Carter's a jerk. But he's supposed to be
with her, 'cause destiny says

28:48.320 --> 28:50.607
they're supposed to be together
and he's supposed to be her soulmate.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.131
So I'm not even sure
what I could say...

28:52.320 --> 28:54.607
You need to do something, Cisco.
We need to reach her.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.167
Egyptian reincarnation is not
in my wheelhouse.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.481
What Kendra is going through
is about accepting who she really is.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.480
Who better to help her do that than a guy
who is clearly in love with her?

29:08.360 --> 29:11.011
I don't know if we're at
the L-bomb stage yet.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.806
I'll talk to her.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.161
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.971
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.523
Yeah, that's nice. I'm gonna talk
to Kendra for a minute, He-Man.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.524
It's Hawkman. Thanks.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.851
We should talk.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.726
I thought you were the one that said
we should wait till this was all over.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.686
Oh, this isn't that talk. This is the
trying-to-help-you-sprout-wings talk.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.521
Yeah, well, according to Carter,
I'm a warrior priestess,

29:41.840 --> 29:43.888
and rage is the key to
rediscovering myself.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.889
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. Aggro thinks that,

29:46.040 --> 29:47.769
but I think he's got
this whole thing twisted.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.362
Instead of focusing on the warrior,
focus on the priestess.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.201
And the nurturer.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.089
The good-hearted person inside.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.051
How do you know I was so
goodhearted 4,000 years ago?

29:58.320 --> 30:01.722
Because I know you, Kendra,
and some things don't change.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.561
I think you're resisting what
Carter's trying to teach you

30:04.720 --> 30:08.042
because it means remembering who you were,
and that is somebody else.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.446
Somebody who loves him.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.083
Ever since I emerged,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.209
I've been remembering our first life.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.561
In Egypt.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.367
But I've been telling Carter I can't
remember anything because

30:25.800 --> 30:30.727
I don't want to accept that I'm some
reincarnated Egyptian warrior priestess.

30:32.120 --> 30:35.920
Okay. Yeah, that's pretty heavy.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.449
But it's also pretty amazing.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.084
I've been through this. You know I have.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.764
And what you're going through
right now, this is a gift.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.284
It's a miracle that most people
don't even get to experience.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.483
Yeah, well, it feels like a nightmare.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.321
Yeah, but that is a choice.
You can choose the other thing.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.807
To remember who you are, or who you were.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.289
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

31:05.800 --> 31:10.567
Let yourself... Let yourself remember.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.488
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
Stay a little longer?

31:22.960 --> 31:27.648
I can't. Hath-Set and I need to make
another offering to Horus.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.642
The augers have said more
sky rocks will be falling soon.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.809
Well, I hear he covets you.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.847
How fortunate I know the man
who can handle him.

31:37.840 --> 31:42.209
Prince Khufu.
What a surprise to find you here,

31:43.480 --> 31:45.164
in Chay-Ara's bed chamber.

31:45.600 --> 31:50.322
Surely you must know that the clergy
is forbidden to lie with royalty.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.281
Get out.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.007
The penalty for such
a transgression is death.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.891
I said get out.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.889
I'm not afraid of your father.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.529
Soon, the sky rocks will decimate
this kingdom and end his rule.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.210
But first, I shall know Chay-Ara
as you have known her.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.364
It Will be all right.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.081
Behind you.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.362
The sky rocks have come to do their work.

32:45.400 --> 32:51.203
My hate will be everlasting.
My enmity will never die.

32:51.880 --> 32:58.081
It will follow you from this life to the
next and to the next and to the next.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.849
Horus, your children need you now.

33:03.360 --> 33:06.409
We need your protection.
Shroud us in your wings.

33:07.560 --> 33:10.609
I will wait for eternity.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.771
Come back to me.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.602
What? What happened?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.927
I think I know how to beat Vandal Savage.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.243
Oliver, you were right. I don't know
how you knew, but you were right.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.647
The gauntlets won't work.
They're missing a critical element.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.401
- How do you know?
- Because I remembered.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.804
I remember how Savage killed us
the first time. Back in Egypt.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.442
I've never been able
to remember our first death.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.483
Well, these sky rocks, meteors,

34:01.800 --> 34:04.451
they fell and they completely
destroyed the royal palace.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.444
During the Middle Kingdom,
Egypt experienced a high level

34:06.640 --> 34:07.926
of meteorite activity.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.327
I know stuff.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.841
Which is one of the many reasons
we love you so much,

34:12.120 --> 34:14.282
but also doesn't seem
to help us stop Savage.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.960
It's the calamity Professor Boardman
was referencing.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.442
The meteors, they had a glow about them.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.768
And Savage's staff had two gemstones
with the exact same glow.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.645
Yeah, the gemstones might be made up
of the same element as the meteorite.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.683
The Egyptians would use meteorite
in their craftsmanship.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.643
And the minerals glow
in proximity to each other.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.041
Like Sankara Stones.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.329
<i>Oh, wait, the Indiana Jones reference</i> is
<i>the only thing</i> I <i>understood.</i>

34:34.480 --> 34:36.847
Two pieces of the same meteorite,
like an Nth metal.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.967
That is the key
to counteracting the staff.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.686
Believe it or not, that isn't actually
the craziest thing I've heard today.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.444
<i>There's a sample of
the meteorite from the Middle Kingdom</i>

34:43.679 --> 34:46.364
at the Keystone City Museum
of Natural History.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.966
Hopefully, I got the right one.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.003
I could synthesize a compatible
isotope out of this,

34:50.159 --> 34:51.161
and coat the gauntlets with it.

34:51.320 --> 34:55.324
Okay, do it. Savage doesn't know
that Kendra's gained access

34:55.520 --> 34:57.648
to all of her abilities.
That makes you our ace in the hole.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.046
Where do you need us?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.240
Suit up.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.931
Ollie. Everyone's in position.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.365
Are you sure about this?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.682
About changing the future?

35:17.880 --> 35:21.521
Barry, what can happen here
that is worse than what already did?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.681
If I knew that, I wouldn't be so worried.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.691
Let's do it.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.728
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.729
I will never be your love.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.721
I know.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.408
That always makes this easier.

35:46.720 --> 35:51.044
Chay-Ara, parting is such sweet sorrow.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.446
Now, Kendra!

36:07.640 --> 36:09.608
(%SCREECHES)

36:29.600 --> 36:30.931
Stand clear!

36:37.600 --> 36:39.170
The gauntlets are working!

36:41.120 --> 36:42.645
No, no, no.
Oliver, get yourself to safety!

36:42.960 --> 36:44.291
We're not leaving each other!

37:01.680 --> 37:03.921
Did we do it? Is he gone?

37:05.520 --> 37:06.521
Yeah, looks like.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.170
I knew you could do it.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.482
I'm having the strangest déjé vu.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.768
You're not the only one.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.891
So, how do you feel now
that Savage is pushing daisies?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.168
Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now,

37:28.320 --> 37:31.005
and he's the one who gets reincarnated?
'Cause that would suck.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.641
I just sprouted wings a few days ago,

37:33.840 --> 37:35.205
and I'm just trying
to wrap my head around that.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.528
You know, he does raise
a good point, though.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.530
Savage is gone for good now, right?

37:39.840 --> 37:42.525
I don't know.
We've never defeated him before.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.491
But we're free.

37:45.800 --> 37:46.847
Ugh, get a room.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.690
Finally have the rest of
your lives in front of you.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.966
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do?

37:50.200 --> 37:52.851
Carter says in our past lives
we used to help people.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.208
After everything
you guys have done for me,

37:55.520 --> 37:56.931
I think I should give that a try.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.206
You make it sound like this try
is happening somewhere else.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.011
In our prior incarnation,
we used to live in Saint Wilkin.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.531
<i>You really liked it there.</i>

38:05.400 --> 38:07.164
Could Cisco and I have a moment?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.566
Of course.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.484
Here we go.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.888
Cisco, I'm really sorry.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.761
You know what? It's fine. It's cool.
It's actually kind of a classic story.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.884
Boy meets girl, boy gets girl,
girl sprouts wings and flies away

38:23.040 --> 38:25.247
with her reincarnated soulmate.
The only part I don't get is,

38:25.440 --> 38:27.568
you don't even really seem to like him.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.287
It's kind of a complicated relationship.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.086
Like most 4,000-year-old
relationships are, I guess.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.408
A week ago, I was a barista.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.683
And I really didn't have a plan
for what I was going to do with my life.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.566
And now you do?

38:43.080 --> 38:44.923
Well, at least I know I want to find out.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.084
Okay. I made you something.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.604
To remember me by, I guess.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.562
I made it out of the Nth metal
that Barry got from the meteorite.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.603
It's got a micro-GPS chip embedded in it.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.890
So if you're ever in trouble,
I'll come find you.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.565
What was that for?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.291
For being you.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.646
Thank you, Cisco.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.123
Well, you did it, Barry.
Everyone's alive.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.606
Our guardian angel.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.440
That's what you told me I could be
when I told you about my powers.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.967
Meant it then, and I know it now.

39:31.960 --> 39:36.329
Hey, Oliver, um, we need to have
a difficult conversation, I think.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.809
About my son?
God, it feels weird to say that.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.761
Well, less about your son
and more about whether or not

39:43.960 --> 39:45.450
you're gonna tell Felicity about him.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.846
I don't think that's any of your business.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.447
You know, yeah, you're right.
It's not really my business.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.008
Except I told you, when I mess with time,
time messes back.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.328
And we've already changed
how things turned out with Savage.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.045
And I'm worried about temporal backlash.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.011
Wait, do you think that the timeline
cares about what I tell my girlfriend?

40:00.320 --> 40:01.321
What are you gonna tell her?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.801
Well, you're right when you say
that the rules keep changing

40:04.000 --> 40:08.005
and that the lives that we lead,
they make us feel powerless.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.167
And it makes me wonder
if William wouldn't be better off

40:12.360 --> 40:14.010
with my world kept separate from his.

40:14.160 --> 40:17.801
Look, Oliver, take it from someone
who didn't get to grow up with his father.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.129
I think the best thing for William
is for you to be a part of his life.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.046
Thanks, Barry.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.966
Yeah, man.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.488
I'm not really a hugger.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.684
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.565
But the thing is, lam fast enough
to just hug you without you knowing,

40:33.800 --> 40:36.201
- so you might as well let me.
- Fine.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.651
Thanks. That wasn't so bad, right?

40:43.560 --> 40:47.326
These are my conditions, Oliver.
You've already asked me for the world.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.568
I'm just asking for the same in return.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.851
Okay.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.370
I won't tell anyone.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.846
Even Felicity.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.164
Felicity. That's a nice name.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.042
She is a nice person. She's the best.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.009
William is in his room.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.089
You're just a friend of Mommy's, okay?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.084
- Hey, William.
- Hello.

41:30.520 --> 41:31.965
You like the Flash?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.246
Can I tell you a secret?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.406
I've actually met the Flash.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.725
What's he like? Is he cool?

41:42.920 --> 41:47.289
Yeah. He's super cool.
He's one of the best guys that I know.

41:50.240 --> 41:54.928
I'm Oliver. I'm a friend of your mom's.
We've known each other a long time.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.610
Wanna play action figures?

41:57.920 --> 41:59.160
Sure. Sure.

42:02.440 --> 42:06.286
William, I'd love to come by
every once in a while to say hello.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.331
Would that be all right with you?

42:09.280 --> 42:11.442
That's Captain Cold. He's a bad guy.

42:12.280 --> 42:16.410
Yes, he is. The Flash is gonna
have to be very fast to catch him.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.280
He will. He's the fastest man alive.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.966
- Oh!
- Got you.

42:24.440 --> 42:29.651
Oh, what a mess.
Oh, we have to clean this place up.

42:29.960 --> 42:34.966
Unless you're ready to tell me
what you said you'd tell me.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.884
Felicity, um...

42:37.080 --> 42:42.325
Oliver, we have a life together, right?

42:42.760 --> 42:44.489
- We're a team.
- Ow.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.327
If something is bothering you,
and I don't know about it,

42:49.800 --> 42:53.407
I can't help you fix it.
I can't be a good teammate.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.571
I love you.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.483
And that makes me want to be
the best teammate ever.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.160
Not in the Lance Armstrong
performance-enhancing drugs kind of way.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.164
More like the more positive
sports analogy I would use

43:06.400 --> 43:07.845
if I knew anything about sports.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.490
What had you acting so strange
when we got to Central City?

43:14.920 --> 43:16.684
It doesn't matter. It's over.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.686
And I am back in Star City. With you.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.691
- Mmm.
- Come here.

43:37.680 --> 43:42.527
Your hate will be everlasting.
Your enmity will never die.

43:43.720 --> 43:48.886
It will follow them from this life
into the next and the next.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.690
You owe me one, buddy.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.481
English - SDH
