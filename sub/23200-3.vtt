00:27.778 --> 00:28.820
Eve!

00:33.241 --> 00:35.452
- Colonel Trevor's office.
- Diana.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.621
Steve, I've been looking all over for you.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.539
I've been trying to get hold of you, too.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.125
Well I just got back. Where are you?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.960
At a football game.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.547
I just get in from a two-hour meeting
with Secret Security...

00:47.631 --> 00:49.549
and you're at a football game.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.885
Now take it easy. I'm on business.

00:51.968 --> 00:55.430
In fact, I want you to watch it too,
it's being televised on Channel 5.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.848
I'll explain later, okay.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.808
Yeah, right. I'll be waiting.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.812
Business.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.316
This, I've got to see.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.488
He's fading back, he's made a pass.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.281
Looking for a receiver.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.719
Another gain like that and they'll be
in field-goal range.

01:34.802 --> 01:39.182
- Think they'll settle for a field goal?
- They'll probably pass for the touchdown.

01:40.224 --> 01:43.853
If they don't make it,
they'll still have time for the field goal.

01:44.312 --> 01:48.024
Have you noticed any of the problems
you've told me to look out for?

01:48.316 --> 01:52.820
No, but remember,
the Knights are three points down.

01:52.904 --> 01:56.741
They came into this game 16-point
favorites, it's already an upset.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.910
Go, go, go!

02:32.318 --> 02:36.572
They got a yard for a first down, everyone
thinks they'll make a short-yardage play.

02:36.655 --> 02:39.742
But I bet they'll pass.
He'll call in his wide receiver.

02:39.825 --> 02:41.410
Go, go, go!

02:42.786 --> 02:43.829
Come here, boy.

02:45.914 --> 02:49.209
There he is now, Number 83,
talking to the coach.

02:49.293 --> 02:51.170
They call him "Gluefingers. "

03:29.624 --> 03:32.753
See, he could have caught that ball
with his eyes shut.

03:32.836 --> 03:35.297
I think maybe he did have his eyes shut.

03:54.482 --> 03:58.653
Now remember, their place-kicker has a
98% success ratio...

03:58.737 --> 04:00.613
inside the 25-yard line.

04:00.697 --> 04:04.284
- And they're on the 22.
- But if you're right about what's going on-

04:04.367 --> 04:05.493
He'll miss.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.100
See what I mean?

05:54.435 --> 05:58.522
Bill, when did you first begin to suspect
that these games were being fixed?

05:58.689 --> 06:01.316
About five or six weeks ago.
Every weekend since then...

06:01.400 --> 06:04.778
the team most favored to win has lost,
and always for the same reason.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.448
That seems to be a bit much
to chalk up to coincidence.

06:08.657 --> 06:12.911
That's what I said, only no one at the
Physical Fitness Council would listen.

06:13.829 --> 06:17.833
Finally, I made such a nuisance of myself
they passed me off to you people.

06:18.208 --> 06:21.128
Well, as of now, I am passing you off...

06:21.962 --> 06:23.088
to Diana.

06:26.258 --> 06:30.095
For which, needless to say,
I shall be eternally grateful.

06:30.178 --> 06:32.764
Well, I wouldn't speak too soon, Bill.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.268
Anyway, if this thing continues...

06:36.601 --> 06:39.104
it could seriously affect national morale.

06:39.604 --> 06:44.276
As you know, football is the closet thing
to religion for many people in this country.

06:44.609 --> 06:49.155
And if organized gambling interests found
a way to control who wins and loses...

06:49.281 --> 06:52.450
That's who you think is behind all this?
Big time gambling?

06:52.534 --> 06:56.079
Somebody is cleaning up
every time a favorite team gets creamed.

07:09.467 --> 07:10.844
You again.

07:14.389 --> 07:16.266
How much are you into me for this time?

07:16.349 --> 07:19.602
I believe I wagered $1,000...

07:19.686 --> 07:21.938
on the underdog at 5-to-1 odds.

07:22.313 --> 07:25.441
Yeah, you got $5,000 coming.

07:29.821 --> 07:31.322
There's your bet...

07:32.824 --> 07:34.367
and there's one...

07:35.576 --> 07:37.287
two, three...

07:39.122 --> 07:40.331
four...

07:41.416 --> 07:44.127
- five-erino.
- Thank you.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.422
I do hope I haven't
depleted your resources.

07:47.630 --> 07:51.175
Tell that to all them poor boobies
who keep betting their favorites.

07:52.427 --> 07:56.013
I'll tell you though, the boys upstairs...

07:56.264 --> 07:59.642
the really big ones, laying the odds
and keeping the books...

08:00.518 --> 08:04.564
they're gonna figure, whoever keeps
winning off what ought to be the losers...

08:04.647 --> 08:09.485
- knows something they don't.
- Let's just say, I have a system.

08:09.986 --> 08:13.155
How come for six weeks now
you've never laid a real bet on me?

08:13.239 --> 08:16.534
I mean, with the streak you're riding,
$5,000 is peanuts.

08:17.159 --> 08:21.872
But $5,000 was all I needed this week.
I'll see you next Monday.

08:22.707 --> 08:25.710
Yeah, same time, same wager.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.923
You're weird, you know that?

08:31.966 --> 08:33.467
I mean really weird.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.107
Hey, Angie, you see this?

08:48.691 --> 08:51.777
Firebombings at two of Tuwiliger's
warehouses last night.

08:52.361 --> 08:54.738
I thought we were laying off Tuwiliger.

08:55.322 --> 08:58.409
Last I heard, he was coming round
to our point of view.

08:58.617 --> 09:00.411
The ugly truth is, he was.

09:00.494 --> 09:03.080
You mean, we weren't
playing with the matches last night.

09:03.163 --> 09:06.166
- That's right.
- Then who's putting the heat on Tuwiliger?

09:07.960 --> 09:11.421
Ten-to-one it was O'Hanlan.
We gotta stop that punk from Philly-

09:11.505 --> 09:13.549
Are we going to do something about it?

09:13.632 --> 09:16.218
I mean he's been
poking around our bookies...

09:16.301 --> 09:19.471
and now he's trying
to muscle in on the retail operation.

09:19.888 --> 09:23.392
You know, maybe a phone call is in order.

09:23.892 --> 09:25.269
Get Mr. Lawrence.

09:42.702 --> 09:45.956
There he is, my favorite college graduate.

09:46.748 --> 09:50.669
- Mr. Beamer, what a surprise.
- Yeah, kind of like the one I just got...

09:51.002 --> 09:55.465
when something was called to my
attention, something highly unusual.

09:56.049 --> 09:58.468
- Something I didn't like.
- What was that?

09:58.593 --> 10:01.096
Somebody's been betting on long shots...

10:01.179 --> 10:04.015
somebody's been winning
on long shots consistently.

10:04.432 --> 10:07.435
Somebody in your territory, Mr. Cappucci.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.105
If the Organization were getting hurt
I'd check into it.

10:10.188 --> 10:14.359
Of course we're not getting hurt.
That's not the point, Mr. Cappucci.

10:14.943 --> 10:18.363
You, with your fancy college degree,
missed the point.

10:19.197 --> 10:23.034
- You think somebody's fixing the games.
- I think there's gotta be a reason...

10:23.118 --> 10:25.578
why the best jocks
in the country do everything...

10:25.662 --> 10:27.956
but hand the ball to the other team...

10:28.414 --> 10:31.376
when the odds are heavily in their favor.

10:31.459 --> 10:34.629
- And you know what else I think?
- That O'Hanlan's responsible.

10:34.712 --> 10:38.091
I think that a rival organization
is fixing the games...

10:38.174 --> 10:41.135
laying money with our bookies,
and cleaning up.

10:41.803 --> 10:43.763
And I think I don't like that.

10:44.263 --> 10:45.890
Yeah, but there's nothing we can do-

10:45.974 --> 10:49.811
The point, Mr. Cappucci,
you were about to miss it again.

10:50.311 --> 10:55.191
O'Hanlan's got a secret, and the only
secrets I like are the ones I got.

10:56.275 --> 10:58.319
Any others are unhealthy.

10:58.402 --> 11:01.239
You know what that means,
Mr. Cappucci, unhealthy?

11:02.156 --> 11:05.409
- I know what it means.
- Good.

11:08.996 --> 11:13.209
It would be a real shame
for all that education to go to waste.

11:21.968 --> 11:24.261
Go get Louis and bring him here. Fast.

11:38.901 --> 11:41.529
Ira, Diana needs the name of a bookie.

11:41.612 --> 11:44.615
Someone who might know anybody
who's been betting consistently...

11:44.698 --> 11:47.368
against the favorite teams
in college football.

11:47.993 --> 11:50.537
The term "bookie, " is imprecise.

11:52.831 --> 11:56.043
Okay, bookmaker.
We need the name of a bookmaker.

11:56.669 --> 11:59.463
Of what significance is a binder of books...

11:59.546 --> 12:01.674
for publication to gamblers?

12:02.007 --> 12:03.050
No.

12:04.385 --> 12:06.053
Odds maker. How's that?

12:06.178 --> 12:08.138
Why didn't you say so?

12:08.931 --> 12:11.517
Yeah, I thought we were going
to be here all day.

12:11.642 --> 12:12.935
No such luck.

12:19.650 --> 12:23.487
The name of an individual
known as Lou the Lithuanian...

12:23.612 --> 12:26.156
has relevance to your request.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.533
Where can I find him?

12:28.784 --> 12:30.953
On most Saturday afternoons...

12:31.036 --> 12:33.914
he can be found at the Sip & Bite Deli.

12:34.247 --> 12:37.334
- He is partial to their egg creams.
- Very good.

12:37.793 --> 12:40.587
I'll have Diana bring you back
a pastrami on rye.

12:40.837 --> 12:43.423
Make it corned beef, hold the mayo.

13:24.506 --> 13:27.842
Okay, Louis, let's go.
Come on, Louis, let's move it.

13:32.430 --> 13:35.308
Help me. Somebody help me.

13:36.768 --> 13:38.061
You wait here.

14:01.459 --> 14:03.086
You guys, let him go.

14:27.777 --> 14:28.903
What happened?

14:29.987 --> 14:31.322
Are you all right?

14:32.865 --> 14:35.576
Those guys, don't let them get away!

14:35.659 --> 14:37.536
I'm afraid they already have.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.885
- I wish Wonder Woman stayed a while.
- Why is that?

14:53.594 --> 14:55.763
I wanted to thank her for helping me out.

14:55.846 --> 14:59.516
Well I'm sure that she knows
that you're grateful. How's your head?

15:00.142 --> 15:01.518
Not much better.

15:02.061 --> 15:04.772
You know,
seeing double isn't so bad, after all.

15:05.356 --> 15:07.733
You make a pretty good-looking
set of twins.

15:17.076 --> 15:20.579
What do we do now?
We blew the only lead we had.

15:21.079 --> 15:25.542
Well, I was thinking of talking to those
ball players who've been responsible...

15:25.667 --> 15:29.630
- for the upset in those games.
- It's a great idea, we can do that tonight.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.881
What's tonight?

15:30.964 --> 15:34.801
The Old-timers' Club is giving an awards
banquet right here in Washington.

15:34.885 --> 15:37.888
All the top college players will be there,
as will we.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.725
We will be doing no such thing...

15:41.808 --> 15:44.561
because you might have
a mild concussion.

15:45.562 --> 15:50.358
- I'll go alone.
- I hate sending you off all by yourself.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.238
Some of those jocks
can be real lady-killers.

15:56.782 --> 15:58.533
Well, don't worry, Bill...

15:58.992 --> 16:03.163
if any of them get out of line,
I'll penalize them 15 yards.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.545
Hi, Harry, Louis here.

16:12.255 --> 16:14.341
Look, I gotta ask you a question.

16:15.759 --> 16:19.095
Angie, what do you think?
Should we lean on him a little?

16:19.262 --> 16:21.097
No, he's scared witless.

16:21.598 --> 16:24.309
You start leaning on him,
he might self-destruct.

16:25.685 --> 16:29.606
Well, if you hear anything let me know.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.109
Okay. Thanks, buddy, thanks.

16:35.945 --> 16:37.947
Looks like I ain't doing so hot.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.701
I mean, I called everybody I could think of.

16:42.785 --> 16:45.038
Then you'll have to try some more,
won't you Louis?

16:45.121 --> 16:49.000
Because it would be good for the
Organization to find out who this guy is.

16:49.083 --> 16:52.045
And what's good for the Organization
is good for you.

16:52.462 --> 16:56.257
- On the other hand-
- I just thought of somebody else.

16:58.092 --> 17:01.554
Fine, Louis.
Why don't you phone that somebody else?

17:08.060 --> 17:11.105
Yeah. How are you Louis?

17:12.022 --> 17:13.773
What can I do you out of?

17:15.984 --> 17:18.195
It's funny you should mention that.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.866
I got a guy who's been doing just that...

17:22.032 --> 17:25.368
betting the underdogs
for the past five or six weeks now.

17:26.329 --> 17:28.998
Nothing big, but consistent, you know.

17:29.206 --> 17:31.292
Listen, who is this guy?

17:32.001 --> 17:35.504
I mean, where could somebody
lay hands on him?

18:32.102 --> 18:34.021
Professor Brubaker, I presume.

18:34.104 --> 18:36.023
Yes, I'm Brubaker, whoever you are.

18:36.106 --> 18:38.567
Look, I'm in the middle
of a very important-

18:39.109 --> 18:41.695
You just can't come
walking in here like this.

18:41.778 --> 18:45.282
You leave right this minute,
or else I'll have to do something-

18:45.866 --> 18:48.827
You shouldn't talk like that
to Mr. Cappucci.

18:52.581 --> 18:53.874
Thank you, Sam.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.377
What do you want with me?

18:58.086 --> 19:02.257
What I want, Professor, putting it bluntly,
is in on your little scam.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.635
- My little scam?
- You see, Professor...

19:05.719 --> 19:09.639
since your name came out of some
research I was doing a few hours ago...

19:10.599 --> 19:13.476
I had you checked out rather thoroughly.

19:15.145 --> 19:18.189
Working in a highly controversial
field of endeavor...

19:18.356 --> 19:21.443
so controversial, in fact,
that you are unable to secure grants...

19:21.526 --> 19:24.237
to finance your experiments.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.825
Because they're a bunch of
narrow-minded pea-brains.

19:29.075 --> 19:31.369
But you can't really blame them, can you?

19:31.453 --> 19:35.915
I mean, remote control of kinetic function
is rather obscure, wouldn't you say?

19:39.043 --> 19:41.337
As if a mobster like you has even...

19:41.421 --> 19:44.174
an inkling of what kinetic function is.

19:45.133 --> 19:49.554
I have an inkling you can make football
players drop passes, miss field goals...

19:49.804 --> 19:52.682
and generally mess up
when you're controlling them.

19:53.683 --> 19:56.769
I also have an inkling
that you are doing so at the behest...

19:56.853 --> 19:59.647
- of some other organization.
- Organization?

20:00.398 --> 20:03.860
- I do it for myself.
- You had no dealings with a Mr. O'Hanlan?

20:04.610 --> 20:07.113
I just do it to get money for my research.

20:07.321 --> 20:10.908
As you said, I cannot get a grant.
Isn't that something?

20:11.159 --> 20:13.244
Professor, your worries are over.

20:13.453 --> 20:16.122
From now on you'll get
all the money you need.

20:16.831 --> 20:20.585
No, thanks, but I've been doing just fine.

20:20.668 --> 20:23.629
Don't fool yourself into thinking
you have a choice, Professor.

20:23.713 --> 20:26.674
Because you don't.
I want a demonstration.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.512
I want to see you make people's muscles
do what you want them to do.

20:33.306 --> 20:37.476
Well I was doing an experiment
here with Rex-

20:37.560 --> 20:41.022
No. Not Rex, not rats.

20:41.647 --> 20:43.315
People. Athletes.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.944
I hope you didn't have
any plans for tonight, Professor.

21:27.526 --> 21:29.695
Perfect, you can see the whole room.

21:32.531 --> 21:36.034
Come on, Diana. I'm telling you,
we were made for each other.

21:36.702 --> 21:39.204
Fly back to the Coast with me after dinner.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.957
Well I would, except that...

21:42.541 --> 21:44.877
I have to talk
to some of the college players here.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.838
Yeah, and I thought quarterbacks
are supposed to throw passes.

21:47.921 --> 21:50.632
You've been making passes at this
kid since she walked in.

21:50.716 --> 21:52.634
What're you, her housemother?

21:53.176 --> 21:57.431
They're all so uncouth.
Listen, let me take you away from all this.

21:57.556 --> 21:59.349
Sorry, but I'm on business.

22:00.183 --> 22:04.396
Isn't that one of the quarterbacks for the
Ohio Chestnuts over there?

22:04.646 --> 22:09.025
Yeah, that's Teddy Davis. But I wouldn't
go asking him about last week's game.

22:09.109 --> 22:11.945
- Why?
- Not after he threw five interceptions.

22:12.028 --> 22:14.322
Three of which got run back for TDs.

22:14.406 --> 22:16.116
Besides, your salad is here.

22:16.199 --> 22:18.743
Well, what do you know?
I was saved by the salad.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.463
Okay, Sam. You and Nick get busy.

22:30.547 --> 22:32.549
But remember, do it discretely.

22:41.558 --> 22:44.144
...and then poor Davis
just seemed to fall apart.

22:44.227 --> 22:46.896
He even threw one pass
clear into the stands.

22:48.231 --> 22:49.858
Darn mosquitoes.

22:51.693 --> 22:55.488
You think they'd figure how to keep the
bugs out of a fancy place like this.

22:56.823 --> 22:59.909
The darts are absorbed into the body
within 20 minutes.

22:59.993 --> 23:02.782
But before they dissolve,
they act as receivers...

23:02.817 --> 23:04.855
for the signals I send out on this.

23:05.415 --> 23:09.419
And the signals transmit scrambled
messages to the brain which...

23:09.585 --> 23:11.421
- foul up muscle control.
- Yes.

23:11.504 --> 23:14.090
I can even transmit
to a higher brain center...

23:14.173 --> 23:16.342
the one that controls emotions.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.185
What would you like to see first?

23:27.186 --> 23:30.731
Roman Gabriel.
He'd get a cramp in his left foot.

23:39.448 --> 23:42.451
Now Lawrence McCutcheon.
Can you get him to spill his wine...

23:42.535 --> 23:44.829
and start an argument with the waiter.

23:49.875 --> 23:52.128
Hey, dummy. Look what you made me do.

23:54.004 --> 23:56.966
Sam, you and Nick
start spreading those darts around.

23:58.426 --> 24:00.719
Get them all on their feet. Confusion.

24:00.886 --> 24:03.514
That's what we want,
a whole lot of confusion.

24:23.617 --> 24:26.161
That's one party crasher
we can do without.

24:28.330 --> 24:31.208
Why did I do that?
And why aren't you creamed?

24:33.961 --> 24:35.796
Okay. Get ready to pull out.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.149
I've never been so mad in my life.

24:56.233 --> 24:59.736
I've never hit a woman,
but there's a first time for everything.

25:07.411 --> 25:09.121
I'll tear you all in half, all of you.

25:09.204 --> 25:12.040
Now hold it.
You guys are gonna hurt yourselves.

25:22.467 --> 25:25.845
Her name's Diana Prince.
She's a government agent.

25:29.391 --> 25:32.394
- She was the one at the dinner last night.
- Yeah.

25:32.978 --> 25:35.730
She threatens to become
a thorn in our side because of...

25:35.814 --> 25:38.274
this man,
who's currently working with her.

25:38.525 --> 25:40.235
His name is Bill Michaels.

25:41.194 --> 25:44.656
He's currently on leave from the
Physical Fitness Council.

25:45.573 --> 25:49.327
Apparently, he's as concerned about
those football upsets as we were.

25:49.452 --> 25:51.871
So now we have both of them in our hair.

25:52.914 --> 25:54.249
Need I say more?

26:03.591 --> 26:06.052
I hear you. Coming!

26:13.101 --> 26:16.437
- Yeah?
- Sorry, sir. Package for Miss Arbogast.

26:16.771 --> 26:18.398
- Miss who?
- Arbogast.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.692
Natalie Rose Arbogast. Want to sign here?

26:22.193 --> 26:25.321
I never heard of the lady.
You have the wrong apartment.

26:25.571 --> 26:29.158
I'm sorry. Do you have any idea
where I might be able to find her?

26:31.744 --> 26:34.831
I don't know
if she's in this apartment building or not.

26:34.914 --> 26:37.199
Why don't you try the
manager, first floor.

26:37.234 --> 26:38.445
I'll do that.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.460
Right.

26:58.771 --> 27:01.482
I just saw our girl
heading for Bill Michaels' place.

27:01.565 --> 27:03.859
And Michaels just took one in the neck.

27:03.943 --> 27:05.736
All right, Nick, you did fine.

27:09.698 --> 27:11.325
Give them a few minutes.

27:12.451 --> 27:15.788
I want her completely off guard
when we pull Michaels' chain.

27:16.705 --> 27:18.791
What do you want me to transmit?

27:19.875 --> 27:22.753
What else? Insane, murderous rage.

27:24.505 --> 27:27.132
He could really kill her, you know.

27:28.217 --> 27:29.301
Squeamish?

27:31.679 --> 27:33.806
Just show me what buttons to push.

27:37.643 --> 27:40.145
Bill, what did the doctor say
about your head?

27:40.687 --> 27:44.233
He says it's still connected,
but it did take a pretty good lick.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.777
Well that's not anything new.

27:46.985 --> 27:50.572
You should have seen some of things
that happened when I played basketball.

27:50.656 --> 27:53.784
Bill, no offence, but I'm glad I didn't.

27:54.743 --> 27:58.413
I understand things got pretty wild
last night. Tell me about that.

27:58.830 --> 28:00.457
Wild, isn't the word.

28:00.582 --> 28:05.003
All of a sudden, eight or 10 of the football
players went berserk, it was the craziest-

28:06.546 --> 28:08.298
Okay, Bill. Knock it off.

28:13.428 --> 28:14.471
Bill!

28:18.683 --> 28:19.768
Hey, Bill.

29:09.567 --> 29:10.652
Bill.

30:15.925 --> 30:18.677
- What hit this place?
- You did.

30:22.014 --> 30:24.099
It's really not your fault, Bill.

30:25.100 --> 30:29.104
I think this is what made you do it.
Come here, I want you to look at this.

30:29.188 --> 30:32.441
Use this, it's the only way
you can get a close look at it.

30:41.575 --> 30:43.118
What the heck is it?

30:43.327 --> 30:47.664
I don't know. It was imbedded in the skin
on your neck. It raised a slight welt.

30:50.292 --> 30:52.544
Guess I'm just allergic to circuitry.

30:59.134 --> 31:02.012
Look at that, Diana. See what it's doing?

31:08.060 --> 31:09.519
It self-destructed.

31:11.021 --> 31:12.356
That's too bad.

31:13.899 --> 31:16.943
I'd have liked a chance to really study it.

31:17.027 --> 31:20.072
Well at least now we've got an idea
of what's going on.

31:21.531 --> 31:22.616
We do?

31:22.699 --> 31:25.827
Well, if we don't,
I know a certain computer that will.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.503
That's what I figured, Mr. Beamer.

31:34.586 --> 31:37.172
The Knights are a 35-point favorite.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.341
The odds are 10-to-1 in their favor.

31:39.424 --> 31:42.010
And you think $1 million will do the trick.

31:42.177 --> 31:44.763
It's a small enough amount
that if we spread it around...

31:44.846 --> 31:47.349
to all O'Hanlan's bookies,
it won't upset the odds.

31:47.432 --> 31:50.769
But it will gross us a tidy $10 million
when the Dusters win.

31:51.144 --> 31:55.065
Only $1 million will do the trick.

31:55.607 --> 31:59.319
We'll be able to do to O'Hanlan
what you thought he was doing to us.

31:59.402 --> 32:02.238
$1 million of Organization money.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.866
It's a sure bet, Mr. Beamer.

32:04.949 --> 32:09.120
Brubaker came up with implants that
last two hours instead of 20 minutes.

32:09.746 --> 32:11.706
That means we just can't fail.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.710
I'm gonna trust you, Mr. Cappucci,
you know why?

32:16.586 --> 32:19.964
Not because of your
impressive educational background...

32:20.548 --> 32:22.383
or your youthful eagerness.

32:23.551 --> 32:27.096
But because I'm going to entrust you
with $1 million...

32:29.098 --> 32:31.392
because I know, that you know...

32:32.185 --> 32:34.854
that if anything happens to those funds...

32:35.563 --> 32:37.732
you'll be one sorry man.

32:39.692 --> 32:43.112
Listen, there's no problem, Mr. Beamer.
I'll be in touch.

32:45.865 --> 32:49.619
Has he promised you a promotion after
we do the job on O'Hanlan's bookies?

32:49.702 --> 32:51.412
Yes, something like that.

32:52.079 --> 32:55.124
- Where's Brubaker?
- In the kitchen. I'll get him.

32:56.042 --> 32:59.045
He's probably fixing himself a bite.
He's been a little green...

32:59.128 --> 33:01.631
since we got back from
Bill Michaels' place.

33:01.881 --> 33:04.925
Yes, the professor has led
a sheltered life, hasn't he?

33:05.343 --> 33:09.180
The professor is not in his room.
The door was open. I think he split.

33:09.263 --> 33:12.224
- What?
- Don't worry, we'll bring him back.

33:14.351 --> 33:16.061
Hold on. Just hold on.

33:17.730 --> 33:21.984
It has just occurred to me,
I can operate the professor's device...

33:22.359 --> 33:23.819
just as well as he.

33:24.528 --> 33:27.573
And perhaps he's outlived
his usefulness to us, anyway.

33:27.865 --> 33:31.577
- But he knows too much.
- We'll put a contract out on him in time.

33:32.202 --> 33:35.080
I'm sure he's too frightened
to do anything but run.

33:51.680 --> 33:56.143
Well, looks like Prof. Brubaker
is ready to head for the hills.

33:57.352 --> 34:00.397
It's as if he knows his name
came out of your computer.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.734
Bill, why don't you go in
and see if you can't...

34:03.817 --> 34:06.111
talk him into
coming along with us peacefully.

34:06.194 --> 34:09.114
Right. What are you going to do?

34:09.656 --> 34:13.909
I think someone should stay here, in case
he comes through one of these windows.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.496
Sounds like you're taking
the heavy part of the job.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.791
Believe me, Bill, I won't get hurt.

34:20.042 --> 34:23.420
You, of all people, should know
that I can take care of myself.

34:24.504 --> 34:26.089
- Okay.
- Right.

34:58.246 --> 35:01.207
Please, I'll give the money back.

35:01.291 --> 35:04.127
I just needed new equipment
for my experiments.

35:04.210 --> 35:07.505
So you used your invention to change
the outcome of football games...

35:07.589 --> 35:10.300
and you bet against
the teams you tampered with.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.886
All right, I admit it.

35:12.969 --> 35:16.973
You also used one of those darts
on Michaels so he nearly killed Prince.

35:17.056 --> 35:20.018
I didn't want to do that.
Mr. Cappucci made me do it.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.687
He's taken over my invention.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.441
But I didn't want any part of murder,
that's why I ran away from him.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.860
- Angelo Cappucci.
- The mobster, yes.

35:29.068 --> 35:31.321
He's going to do something really big.

35:31.404 --> 35:35.116
He says, he's going to win $10 million
on one football game.

35:35.324 --> 35:37.201
Which game? What team?

35:37.285 --> 35:40.455
I don't know, I didn't hear,
I was too busy running away.

35:41.664 --> 35:44.751
That's them. They've come to get me
for running out on them.

35:44.834 --> 35:46.544
No, that's Bill Michaels.

35:46.711 --> 35:50.465
I want you to forget I was here.
Surrender to him and Diana Prince.

35:50.590 --> 35:53.718
They'll protect you and help you make up
for what you've done...

35:53.801 --> 35:55.178
if you cooperate.

36:03.519 --> 36:06.939
Please. I'll cooperate.

36:07.565 --> 36:11.110
I want to cooperate.
Just tell me what you want me to do.

36:12.653 --> 36:15.489
- Bill, you need some help?
- No, I...

36:16.032 --> 36:20.077
- pretty much got everything under control.
- What happened?

36:43.809 --> 36:47.771
This is the football game Cappucci will hit,
between the Colorado Knights and...

36:47.855 --> 36:49.648
and the California Dusters, right?

36:49.732 --> 36:52.609
Affirmative, it is the only
upcoming game...

36:52.693 --> 36:56.613
in Which the Organization could win
the amount ofmoney Brubaker specified.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.576
But the Knights are 35-point
favorites in that game.

37:00.659 --> 37:03.036
You did indicate that Angelo Cappucci...

37:03.120 --> 37:06.874
has a way of controlling
the outcome of the game. Did you not?

37:07.124 --> 37:10.377
Yeah, but I didn't want to send
Bill and Diana off...

37:10.460 --> 37:14.298
to California to watch that game when
the game they should cover is in Kansas.

37:14.381 --> 37:16.425
Trust me, Steve Trevor.

37:18.594 --> 37:20.220
As if I had any choice.

37:24.266 --> 37:26.143
Talk about your needles in your haystacks.

37:26.226 --> 37:29.521
At least we know it'll take Cappucci a
while to throw the game...

37:29.604 --> 37:33.233
and make sure it stays thrown.
It gives us about two hours to find him.

37:33.316 --> 37:35.193
- Do you have those pictures?
- Sure.

37:35.861 --> 37:39.531
So does every other agent the IADC
Field Office could spare.

37:40.448 --> 37:44.161
Pretty soon, there's gonna be about
50 pairs of eyes looking for these guys.

37:45.871 --> 37:48.623
We don't even know for sure
they're going to be here.

37:58.383 --> 38:02.637
These are my cousins from Ames, Nick.
Phyllis and Gilda.

38:03.430 --> 38:06.182
- Welcome to California, girls.
- Thank you, Nick.

38:06.808 --> 38:10.645
Why don't you girls get on the bus.
Nick will explain your assignment to you.

38:10.729 --> 38:13.773
And give you the special equipment
we prepared for you.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.432
Everything is right on schedule,
Mr. Beamer.

38:47.515 --> 38:50.518
Yeah. All the bets have been placed,
all is in order.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.773
Yes, I am well aware
of how much you trust me.

39:10.997 --> 39:12.748
Welcome to California, boys.

39:12.832 --> 39:16.043
Hope you fellas leave our home team
more or less the way you find it.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.214
Not too many broken bones, okay?

39:28.347 --> 39:31.809
We should be at the stadium
in about 10 minutes, so enjoy the ride.

39:32.059 --> 39:35.896
If there's anything you need, don't forget
to ask one of our lovely hostesses.

39:36.397 --> 39:37.940
We already asked her.

39:43.362 --> 39:45.447
...we got to go for the-

39:45.864 --> 39:49.743
Your trainer asked us to give you
your vitamins on the bus.

40:31.994 --> 40:33.286
Hot dogs here!

40:59.437 --> 41:02.482
Run in by Kramer for a touchdown...

41:03.316 --> 41:06.569
Look's like there's no doubt
that Angie's here.

41:06.695 --> 41:08.154
Yeah, but where?

41:08.363 --> 41:10.657
We've covered almost half the stadium.

41:10.824 --> 41:13.118
Which means we only have half to go.

41:16.871 --> 41:21.000
Set, 41, 28, 34.

41:21.584 --> 41:23.628
Hut, hut, hut!

41:30.134 --> 41:31.219
Fumble!

41:36.891 --> 41:39.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
in all my years of sportscasting...

41:39.978 --> 41:42.897
I have never seen anything
like the incredible debacle...

41:42.981 --> 41:46.025
that is taking place before
my disbelieving eyes today.

41:46.317 --> 41:48.319
This Cherry Bowl Championship team...

41:48.403 --> 41:50.738
unbeaten in its last 12 games...

41:50.988 --> 41:53.241
and a heavy favorite over, admittedly...

41:53.324 --> 41:56.285
one of the weakest college football
teams in the nation today...

41:56.369 --> 41:58.329
is making error after error...

41:58.412 --> 41:59.997
mistake after mistake...

42:00.081 --> 42:03.459
in the most dismal display of
athletic asininity...

42:03.543 --> 42:06.003
this reporter has ever witnessed.

42:06.170 --> 42:08.297
And that's telling it like it is.

42:22.895 --> 42:25.690
Diana, that's it. We've covered
the entire stadium.

42:25.773 --> 42:28.984
The only people we've seen
are the other IADC agents.

42:29.068 --> 42:31.237
They haven't had any better luck
than we have.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.906
- We know Cappucci is here.
- Yeah.

42:34.865 --> 42:38.869
What did Professor Brubaker say the
maximum range of his transmitter was?

42:39.036 --> 42:41.705
About a mile, I think. Yeah, a mile.

42:48.837 --> 42:51.757
Maybe Mr. Cappucci
just doesn't like crowds.

42:52.716 --> 42:53.759
What?

42:54.718 --> 42:57.846
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

42:58.889 --> 43:02.226
Nothing like a good, clean football game
to spend an afternoon.

43:07.189 --> 43:08.565
...fourth down and one yard.

43:46.103 --> 43:47.437
Here she comes again!

43:51.900 --> 43:52.984
Rush her.

44:42.659 --> 44:43.701
Angie.

44:45.203 --> 44:46.913
The transmitter, drop it.

45:38.297 --> 45:41.258
Angie, what are you gonna do
once you get up here?

45:51.060 --> 45:52.102
...touchdown!

45:58.651 --> 46:02.696
The authorities have decided not to
prosecute you, Professor, because...

46:02.780 --> 46:06.158
they don't think they can convince a jury
you did what you did.

46:06.241 --> 46:08.702
Then that's it? I can leave?

46:09.244 --> 46:10.662
You're a free man.

46:12.289 --> 46:14.041
What about Cappucci?

46:14.458 --> 46:18.462
I heard his lawyers got him out on bond
10 minutes after he was arrested.

46:18.587 --> 46:21.089
He'll try to kill me, he is so mean.
I know he will.

46:21.173 --> 46:25.135
I think Mr. Cappucci has enough to
worry about all on his own, Professor.

46:25.385 --> 46:29.056
The Knights-Dusters game is
being replayed this weekend.

46:29.848 --> 46:31.266
Fairly and squarely.

46:31.350 --> 46:33.602
And don't forget, all bets still stand.

46:33.685 --> 46:37.731
I don't think Cappucci's superiors are too
happy with that $1 million investment.

46:37.814 --> 46:41.985
My guess is that Angie will soon be
fitted with a cement-lined swimming suit.

46:44.654 --> 46:46.823
Thank you, if you will excuse me now.

46:46.907 --> 46:48.366
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

46:52.496 --> 46:55.582
Brilliant man. I wonder if we've heard
the last of him?

46:57.542 --> 46:58.585
Diana?

47:01.171 --> 47:03.590
Not to worry, it's a for-real mosquito.

47:51.638 --> 47:52.680
