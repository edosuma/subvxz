(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:01.897 --> 00:02.746
I was helping out a friend.

00:02.771 --> 00:04.246
She looked like a little
more than a friend.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.302
(Taylor) If you hadn't have been there...

00:05.327 --> 00:06.675
- (Max) But I was.
- Taylor!

00:06.700 --> 00:08.352
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for you, Taylor.

00:08.377 --> 00:10.477
Can you please not tell
Max about what happened?

00:10.502 --> 00:12.159
Carter, work at the bar.

00:12.184 --> 00:13.157
It means the world to me

00:13.182 --> 00:14.101
that you're letting me keep it.

00:14.127 --> 00:16.352
I need to know that I can trust you.

00:16.376 --> 00:18.239
As for you and me, I give up.

00:18.264 --> 00:20.550
You're my kryptonite.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.371
- Olivia, can you hear me?
- Hey!

00:22.396 --> 00:24.339
- Olivia!
- Is she breathing?

00:24.365 --> 00:25.165
What did she take?

00:25.190 --> 00:26.407
I don't know, okay!

00:26.432 --> 00:27.502
Then what should we do?

00:27.527 --> 00:28.970
Okay, I'm gonna splash water on her.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.429
Ben, she's not waking up!

00:33.543 --> 00:34.660
- Olivia, wake up!
- Come on!

00:34.685 --> 00:35.272
Wake up!

00:35.297 --> 00:36.558
We need to get her to a hospital.

00:36.582 --> 00:38.104
- No, we can't go to a hospital, okay?
- Why?

00:38.129 --> 00:39.247
'Cause we just can't.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.016
What are you talking about?

00:40.041 --> 00:41.079
Put her back down, put her back down.

00:41.105 --> 00:41.981
Get me a towel!

00:42.006 --> 00:43.549
Olivia.

00:43.574 --> 00:45.674
- Olivia, wake up!
- My God, what's happening?

00:45.699 --> 00:47.355

- What's so funny?

01:27.552 --> 01:30.053
Jared just sent me this hilarious...

01:31.501 --> 01:33.044
Uh, we're just working out

01:33.069 --> 01:34.555
our schedule for the week. He's funny.

01:34.580 --> 01:35.547
How old is he?

01:35.572 --> 01:36.755
Who, Jared?

01:36.780 --> 01:38.524
I don't know, like 22?

01:40.473 --> 01:42.540
Carter, I feel, um...

01:42.565 --> 01:44.155
I feel like we need to have a talk.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.403
Okay, if this is any
way related to <i>the</i> talk,

01:46.428 --> 01:47.762
I think we're a little late for that.

01:47.787 --> 01:48.954
Ugh, way late.

01:48.979 --> 01:51.541
Uh, this is a different part of the talk.

01:51.566 --> 01:55.572
I think mixing work and
pleasure is a bad idea.

01:55.598 --> 01:56.833
Mom, we're not mixing anything.

01:56.858 --> 01:58.538
- Except drinks.
- Except drinks.

01:58.563 --> 01:59.752
This is the thing.

01:59.777 --> 02:02.292
Older men, they have
different expectations.

02:02.317 --> 02:03.577
About what?

02:03.602 --> 02:04.641
About everything.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.426
About dating, relationships, intimacy.

02:07.458 --> 02:11.530
They might not take things
as seriously as you do.

02:11.555 --> 02:15.087
Well, I'm glad you think
I take it so seriously,

02:15.112 --> 02:16.592
but it's really not an issue.

02:16.617 --> 02:18.699
It's just Carter, once you're out of school

02:18.724 --> 02:21.158
and have real
responsibilities in the world,

02:21.183 --> 02:22.458
everything is different.

02:22.483 --> 02:25.460
Well, thank you, Mom, from my future self.

02:25.485 --> 02:27.509
I'm just trying to keep
you from making a mistake

02:27.534 --> 02:28.685
and getting your feelings hurt.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.482
Mom, that is really not my situation.

02:30.506 --> 02:33.504
And even if it were, you're
making love sound like a...

02:33.529 --> 02:35.994
disease that needs a vaccination.

02:40.096 --> 02:42.091
Just be careful.

02:42.116 --> 02:45.291
There's nothing between me and Jared.

02:52.316 --> 02:54.317
Do you think she knew I was lying?

02:54.342 --> 02:59.258
No, but the part about Jared
being 22 is a bit farfetched.

02:59.283 --> 03:00.661
He looks older.

03:00.693 --> 03:01.755
I hate lying to her,

03:01.780 --> 03:03.588
but I just don't want her in my business.

03:03.613 --> 03:05.113
Yeah, me either.

03:05.348 --> 03:09.013
Hey, you promise you're not
gonna say anything, right?

03:09.462 --> 03:12.677
Oh. No, not if you don't want me to.

03:16.064 --> 03:17.972
Just please don't tell Mom.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.317
No, I promise.

03:19.342 --> 03:20.462
Or Max.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.022
Tay, I really think he would want to know.

03:23.047 --> 03:25.565
Look, I just want to forget it, okay?

03:25.590 --> 03:27.090
I mean it.

03:27.802 --> 03:29.969
Okay.

03:30.346 --> 03:32.484
If that's what you want.

03:33.621 --> 03:35.293
Okay, let's talk about something else.

03:35.318 --> 03:39.921
Like, tonight, your first
overnighter with Jared.

03:41.099 --> 03:42.933
What are you guys gonna do?

03:42.958 --> 03:46.260
Um... I don't know.

03:46.424 --> 03:50.815
He's... He's got this friend
playing MacDougall's later,

03:50.840 --> 03:52.086
so maybe we'll do that.

03:52.111 --> 03:54.035
And probably grab dinner somewhere, too.

03:54.061 --> 03:57.213
Oh, and I think I'm finally
gonna get to see his apartment.

03:58.684 --> 04:00.109
Are you nervous?

04:00.939 --> 04:03.909
Yeah, but, like, good nervous, you know?

04:03.934 --> 04:05.702
Yeah, I remember that feeling.

04:05.727 --> 04:06.925
Just, butterflies.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.989
Every time I think about
him, I start smiling.

04:09.014 --> 04:10.503
Like an idiot.

04:10.528 --> 04:11.716
Exactly.

04:11.741 --> 04:16.232
So, the official story is
I am with you all night

04:16.257 --> 04:17.791
- at the house concert.
- Right.

04:17.899 --> 04:21.003
It's a bummer you're not gonna
get to meet Ben's foster sister.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.055
Ben's foster sister?

04:22.079 --> 04:23.177
Yeah, he's bringing her tonight.

04:23.202 --> 04:25.237
That's why I said that
he could use our car.

04:25.428 --> 04:26.729
What, did he not tell you?

04:26.754 --> 04:30.161
No, but I guess we're not
exactly BFFs right now.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.265
What happened?

04:31.743 --> 04:34.368
Nothing. I'll get over it.

04:34.393 --> 04:37.757
Anyway, I am not gonna let
it ruin my night with Jared.

No, we're going to study.

05:28.175 --> 05:30.137
We reported him.

05:34.178 --> 05:36.106

05:36.131 --> 05:38.128
how I was doing every ten seconds,

05:38.153 --> 05:39.580

05:42.209 --> 05:43.686

I just don't want it to sneak up on you.

that's what you're saying.

09:44.769 --> 09:46.069
Foster sister, right?

09:46.094 --> 09:47.627
Real sister, right?

09:47.652 --> 09:50.776
Yep, still trying to mentally
get on board with that.

09:50.801 --> 09:53.470
- No offense, Ben.
- None taken.

09:53.495 --> 09:54.871
All right, enough Brady Bunch,

09:54.896 --> 09:57.285
let's all thank Seth
for getting us in here.

09:57.310 --> 09:59.025
(all) Thank you, Seth!

09:59.050 --> 10:01.255
It was my pleasure,
just sharing the wealth.

10:01.501 --> 10:05.609
Let's drink my latest
house concert cocktail.

10:05.634 --> 10:09.337
Gluten-free, vegan, and heaps
of vitamins and minerals.

10:09.362 --> 10:12.074
He means vodka with a splash of juice.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.600
Uh, yeah, actually, she's
designated driver, so.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.294
- Sorry.
- Well, a girl can dream.

10:17.319 --> 10:19.062
- Any soda?
- Yeah, in the kitchen.

10:19.087 --> 10:20.066
You want me to get you one?

10:20.091 --> 10:21.913
- Will you get me one too?
- Yeah.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.697
You can get a drink if you want.

10:23.722 --> 10:24.989
We're gonna be here all night.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.832
No, I know, I'm just...  not in the mood.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.455
You know what? No worries, I got it.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.324
- You wanna come?
- Yeah.

10:35.306 --> 10:37.630
Everything okay?

10:37.655 --> 10:41.142
Everything's great. I'm fine.

10:46.035 --> 10:48.813
Hey, um, I didn't mean to put on you before

10:48.838 --> 10:51.091
but you've only been
sober for, like, 22 days

10:51.116 --> 10:52.116
or something, right?

10:52.141 --> 10:55.012
21. But who's counting?

10:56.789 --> 10:58.361
Look, seriously.

10:58.386 --> 11:01.561
I'm really glad you're watching out for me.

11:01.586 --> 11:04.609
I don't want to mess things up again.

11:04.634 --> 11:06.101
And I'm not going to.

11:06.126 --> 11:07.359
Promise.

11:07.517 --> 11:09.485
Yeah, I know.

11:09.510 --> 11:11.239
Totally.

11:11.264 --> 11:14.311
Hey, mind if I steal this
little flower for a walk around?

11:14.336 --> 11:16.571
We can check out all the cute boys.

11:16.596 --> 11:18.597
Uh, you already have a cute boy.

11:18.622 --> 11:19.753
Yeah, but you don't.

11:19.778 --> 11:20.912
Oh.

11:21.038 --> 11:23.189
Yeah, sure, go.

11:23.394 --> 11:25.428
Have fun.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.720
Oh, hey.

11:32.745 --> 11:34.712
I was just texting your dad.

11:35.168 --> 11:36.669
He sends a big hello.

11:36.694 --> 11:38.990
Oh, well, hello back.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.678
Regan's coming over in a little bit

11:40.703 --> 11:42.302
and we were gonna go watch a movie.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.910
Max is almost done

11:43.935 --> 11:45.178
with the first part of the basement.

11:45.203 --> 11:46.652
I thought we were gonna paint it together.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.691
Oh, shoot, yeah, that's right.

11:48.716 --> 11:49.916
Totally forgot, sorry.

11:49.941 --> 11:53.410
It's okay, I can... start it myself.

11:54.415 --> 11:56.389
So, uh, how's Dad doing?

11:56.414 --> 11:58.248
Oh, he's good. He's good.

11:58.273 --> 12:00.708
We were just texting about how
fast you guys are growing up.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.491
That's what you guys are texting?

12:02.516 --> 12:04.066
Yeah, it's a parent thing.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.926
You know, kids grow up,
mom and dads get sad.

12:07.713 --> 12:09.714
Time flies.

12:11.763 --> 12:14.097
Oh, um...  maybe Regan and I

12:14.122 --> 12:16.217
can help in the basement for
a while before the movie.

12:16.242 --> 12:17.801
Yeah! That would be great.

12:17.869 --> 12:18.900
I can pick up a pizza.

12:18.925 --> 12:20.297
What movie are you guys watching?

12:20.322 --> 12:22.700
Oh, uh, some old movie.

12:22.725 --> 12:23.725
Edward...

12:23.750 --> 12:25.179
- Scissorhands, yes.
- Yeah.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.504
Old movie.

12:26.529 --> 12:27.942
That came out when I was in high school.

12:27.967 --> 12:31.042

Huh?

13:00.940 --> 13:03.369

13:03.394 --> 13:05.307
share the same biological parents.

13:05.332 --> 13:06.419
My mom was the egg donor,

13:06.444 --> 13:08.488
but my dad had no idea
that my brother was born

13:08.513 --> 13:09.544
because by that point,

13:09.569 --> 13:10.976
he had broken up with my donor mom,

13:11.001 --> 13:12.395
he was with the mom who carried me,

13:12.420 --> 13:13.800
who I actually think of as my real mom,

13:13.825 --> 13:16.542
even though my original
donor mom had me for 13 years

13:16.567 --> 13:18.566
before I found out that
she actually kidnapped me.

13:18.591 --> 13:20.792
Oh, and my brother went into foster care,

13:20.817 --> 13:22.671

about him until recently.

19:19.907 --> 19:21.082
Yeah, let's paint.

19:21.107 --> 19:22.842
You know, there are days I
don't even think about it.

19:22.867 --> 19:23.668
You know why?

19:23.693 --> 19:26.181
Because I have three amazing children,

19:26.206 --> 19:27.074
a great husband,

19:27.099 --> 19:29.410
a job that I love, we're all together.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.154
Well, most of the time.

19:31.742 --> 19:33.419
Life is good.

19:33.444 --> 19:35.219
I think you should write
a book, Miss Wilson.

19:36.150 --> 19:38.285
Yeah.

19:38.310 --> 19:42.034
Well, how about I order us pizza first?

19:44.498 --> 19:48.075
Wow, your mom is pretty amazing.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.054
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

19:51.078 --> 19:54.981
(vomiting)

19:55.006 --> 19:57.065
Ugh.

19:57.624 --> 20:00.236
I'm so embarrassed.

20:00.261 --> 20:02.228
Oh, come on, it happens.

20:02.719 --> 20:06.143
I just... I don't know what happened,

20:06.168 --> 20:08.058
you know?

20:08.084 --> 20:10.619
You should drink some water.

20:13.326 --> 20:15.426
Hey, wait, where's Ben?

20:15.451 --> 20:17.127
He's, uh, in the living room.

20:17.152 --> 20:18.544
Wanted to give you some privacy.

20:18.572 --> 20:21.171
He's not calling my foster parents, is he?

20:21.196 --> 20:23.063
- What?
- Because they'll send me back to juvie

20:23.088 --> 20:24.101
- and I can't... 
- No, no, no, he's not calling,

20:24.126 --> 20:25.581
he's not calling your foster parents.

20:25.605 --> 20:26.926
Calm down, it's fine.

20:26.951 --> 20:28.178
Drink some more water.

20:28.204 --> 20:29.972
Come on.

20:32.413 --> 20:34.348
Ben said you were cool.

20:34.373 --> 20:36.575
- Did he?
- Yeah.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.380
He really likes you.

20:39.807 --> 20:43.476
You know, I was so
nervous about meeting you.

20:43.501 --> 20:45.566
You know, that's why I had a couple drinks.

20:45.591 --> 20:46.750
It was just...

20:46.774 --> 20:49.236
It's just for my nerves, you know?

20:49.261 --> 20:51.179
I get it.

20:52.276 --> 20:54.277
(chuckling)

20:54.740 --> 20:56.894
I'm glad we're sisters.

20:56.919 --> 20:58.734
Sort of.

21:01.215 --> 21:03.216
- (sighs)
- You okay?

21:03.241 --> 21:06.444
No, I... I feel kind of sick again.

21:06.629 --> 21:08.557
Would you mind?

21:08.582 --> 21:10.286
Uh, no.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.780
Just call me if you need anything, okay?

Damon said something happened.

22:09.554 --> 22:13.548
No, nothing happened.

22:29.928 --> 22:31.966

22:31.991 --> 22:33.264
Too long.

22:33.289 --> 22:35.090
That's why I've been doing my thing.

22:35.115 --> 22:36.786
You know, gather up some extra cash

22:36.811 --> 22:39.041
- to get her in rehab.
- Did you tell Jared that?

22:39.073 --> 22:40.604
No, I didn't give him any details,

22:40.629 --> 22:44.212
he just... he told me to keep
my business out of his business.

22:45.733 --> 22:49.702
You know, he... he told
me he really likes you.

22:49.727 --> 22:51.094
Really?

22:51.119 --> 22:52.653
No, I just made that up.

22:52.678 --> 22:55.313

22:57.057 --> 22:59.104
Look, um...

23:00.306 --> 23:02.741
I know I've been a jerk.

23:02.766 --> 23:06.835
So, I'm sorry that I told Elizabeth.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.433
I'll take that as an apology.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.493
It is.

23:13.151 --> 23:14.896
Thanks.

23:14.921 --> 23:17.389
Thank you for helping me tonight.

23:17.414 --> 23:19.332
Sure.

23:19.357 --> 23:24.158
We should probably go check on her.

23:31.107 --> 23:32.963
Olivia?

23:33.914 --> 23:36.016
Liv, come on, open up.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.866
(knocking)

23:37.891 --> 23:39.458
Olivia, open the door.

23:39.674 --> 23:40.908
Wait a sec.

23:40.933 --> 23:42.701
- Why is it locked?
- Did she lock it?

23:42.726 --> 23:44.466
Olivia, open the door!

23:44.491 --> 23:45.441
(knocking)

23:45.466 --> 23:46.544
Will you open up, please?

23:46.569 --> 23:48.119
Hey, wait!

23:53.867 --> 23:55.401
Get her head up. Get her up!

23:55.426 --> 23:57.141
Olivia!

23:58.014 --> 23:59.363
Olivia!

23:59.388 --> 24:00.814
Olivia can you hear me?

24:00.839 --> 24:01.941
Hey! Is she breathing?

24:01.966 --> 24:03.855
What did she take? I don't know, okay?

24:03.880 --> 24:04.879
What should we do?

24:04.904 --> 24:06.509
- I'm gonna get water.
- Olivia, wake up.

24:06.534 --> 24:07.784
Olivia, wake up!

24:07.810 --> 24:08.973
She's not waking up.

24:08.998 --> 24:10.120
Wake up! Wake up!

24:10.402 --> 24:11.635
We need to get her to a hospital.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.361
No, we can't go to a hospital, okay?

24:13.386 --> 24:14.722
- Why?!
- Because we just can't.

24:14.747 --> 24:15.789
What are you talking about?

24:15.814 --> 24:16.948
Put her back down, put her back down.

24:16.973 --> 24:18.073
Get me a towel.

24:18.098 --> 24:19.602
Olivia!

24:19.978 --> 24:22.352
- Olivia, wake up.
- My God, what's happening?

24:22.377 --> 24:24.208
She's not breathing.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.146
Lori, I don't know what to do.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.153
She's been throwing up all evening.

24:29.178 --> 24:31.281
Make sure her tongue's not
up blocking her airway.

24:31.306 --> 24:33.471
Ben, go to the store,
get activated charcoal.

24:33.496 --> 24:35.932
Take my car. Go, Ben, now!

24:36.053 --> 24:38.037
Shouldn't we be calling an ambulance?

24:38.062 --> 24:38.945
She just needs to breathe.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.261
Gotta get her breathing, she gotta breathe.

24:41.286 --> 24:42.901
You should breathe too, sweetie.

24:42.926 --> 24:44.251
Breathe.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.824
(coughing)

24:48.849 --> 24:51.130
Okay, good girl, there you go.

24:51.155 --> 24:52.226
There you go.

24:52.251 --> 24:54.355
Cough it up, there you go.

24:54.476 --> 24:55.560
You're gonna be okay.

24:55.585 --> 24:57.719
Help me stand her up. Come
on, we're gonna stand up.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.724
There you go. There you go, sweetie.

24:59.749 --> 25:00.936
We're gonna get you in the shower.

25:00.961 --> 25:02.660
Everything is gonna be fine.

25:02.685 --> 25:04.696
- (crying)
- Other leg, there you go.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.862
Shh, shh, shh. You're not gonna like this.

25:06.887 --> 25:08.661
But when Ben gets back with your medicine,

25:08.686 --> 25:10.198
this will be the easy part, okay?

25:10.223 --> 25:11.423
- (sobbing)
- Here we go.

25:11.448 --> 25:14.483
(sobbing)

25:14.508 --> 25:16.214
It's okay, honey, it's okay.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.167
You're gonna be just fine,
keep breathing, okay?

25:19.191 --> 25:21.792
There you go, keep breathing.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.575
Good girl.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.712
You're doing great, doing great, baby.

25:26.737 --> 25:29.296
Shh.

25:41.534 --> 25:43.454
Hmm.

25:46.275 --> 25:48.439
Ben's with her.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.273
He's a good brother.

25:52.106 --> 25:54.268
You were really great in there.

25:54.293 --> 25:55.727
So were you.

25:59.421 --> 26:01.457
You seen my phone?

26:01.482 --> 26:03.493
Um, no.

26:03.525 --> 26:04.934
Did you leave it at the party?

26:04.959 --> 26:06.492
No, I don't think so.

26:06.517 --> 26:08.852
Are you expecting a call?

26:09.252 --> 26:11.548
Uh, yeah, I am, actually.

26:11.573 --> 26:13.068
From your mom?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.020
Wow.

26:16.045 --> 26:18.939
I never heard you call her that before.

26:19.592 --> 26:21.133
Does she know where you are?

26:21.158 --> 26:23.501
No, and I'm gonna keep it that way.

26:23.526 --> 26:26.681
Well, you should at least let
her know that you're safe.

26:26.706 --> 26:28.054
She thinks I'm with Max and Taylor.

26:28.079 --> 26:29.313
She knows I'm safe.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.417
So, who are you waiting to hear from?

26:33.467 --> 26:36.736
Uh... no one.

26:38.445 --> 26:40.632
Hey, thank...  Thanks for helping out.

26:40.657 --> 26:42.696
My mom's really jumping to get this done.

26:42.721 --> 26:43.697
I don't mind.

26:43.722 --> 26:46.557
Just happy you and I get to hang out.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.252

I can tell. Who is he?

27:58.021 --> 28:01.457
- He's my boss.
- That happens.

28:01.482 --> 28:03.417
A lot of people meet at work.

28:03.442 --> 28:05.593
Okay, he's older than me.

28:05.618 --> 28:07.920
How old is old?

28:07.945 --> 28:09.577
Like 25.

28:09.608 --> 28:12.977
- Does Elizabeth know?
- Are you kidding?

28:13.002 --> 28:15.938
No, she already gave me her
take on dating older men,

28:15.963 --> 28:17.452
and suffice it to say,

28:17.477 --> 28:19.548
she's not taking the romantic view.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.906
Mmm.

28:20.931 --> 28:23.032
Well, she's right to be concerned.

28:23.057 --> 28:25.353
That is quite an age difference.

28:25.379 --> 28:27.180
Yeah, but I don't know.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.898
When we're together, I never notice it.

28:31.229 --> 28:33.294
Anyway, so tonight,

28:33.319 --> 28:35.452
we were supposed to have our first real,

28:35.477 --> 28:36.944
like, date night.

28:36.969 --> 28:39.136
But he thought we were just gonna hang out

28:39.161 --> 28:40.727
after work like we always do.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.272
Sounds like a miscommunication.

28:42.296 --> 28:44.086
Either that or I'm just in this

28:44.111 --> 28:45.534
way deeper than he is.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.278
How deep?

28:48.079 --> 28:49.728
I really like him.

28:49.753 --> 28:51.847
What do you like about him?

28:51.872 --> 28:55.854
I don't know, like, his sense of humor.

28:55.878 --> 29:00.081
How passionate he gets
when he talks about work.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.074
The way he talks to people.

29:03.351 --> 29:05.728
If you like him and you want him,

29:05.753 --> 29:09.711
listen to your heart and follow it.

29:11.077 --> 29:13.478
Right, okay, simple as that.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.739
Simple is not the same as easy.

29:16.764 --> 29:19.524
Doesn't mean you're not
gonna get your heart crushed,

29:19.549 --> 29:21.178
but you know, you'll cross that bridge

29:21.203 --> 29:22.337
when you come to it.

29:22.362 --> 29:24.238
So you don't think I'm
making a huge mistake?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.606
I think you need to trust yourself.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.765
Exactly the thing my mom
doesn't think I should do.

29:29.790 --> 29:31.286
Every mother in the world

29:31.311 --> 29:32.912
wants to protect her child from being hurt.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.000
So you agree with her?

29:34.025 --> 29:37.575
No. But I understand her.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.218
You're strong, Carter.

29:39.242 --> 29:41.006
Whatever happens, you can handle it.

29:41.031 --> 29:43.487
