02:11.966 --> 02:13.468
I know what
you're all thinking.

02:14.552 --> 02:15.887
But it is not true!

02:16.930 --> 02:18.681
I didn't mean to kill him.

02:20.475 --> 02:22.477
He made me kill him.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.315
He taunted me.
He made fun of me.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.692
What was I supposed to do?

02:30.777 --> 02:32.529
What kind of a man

02:33.321 --> 02:36.324
taunts and tells lies
about his own brother?

02:36.407 --> 02:37.784
And what lies did he tell?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.245
Well, you know that
as well as I do, Hvitserk.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.038
He said you weren't
a real man.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.046
And what would you have done

02:50.129 --> 02:52.048
if he had said that
to you, Ubbe?

02:53.424 --> 02:56.427
What would you have done
if you were "a real man"?

03:01.099 --> 03:03.518
I swear to the gods and
everything that is sacred

03:03.601 --> 03:05.144
that I never meant
to kill him.

03:05.687 --> 03:08.356
Anger overcame me.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.192
And I wasn't thinking.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.195
I am truly sorry.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.757
You cannot leave him in charge
of the Great Army.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.634
That is your affair, Ubbe.

03:37.427 --> 03:38.803
You're his big brother.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.638
You take charge.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.474
I told you, this is
none of my concern.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.977
I plan to return to
the Mediterranean...

03:48.521 --> 03:51.149
With Halfdan.

03:53.943 --> 03:55.737
Will you return first
to Kattegat?

03:57.655 --> 03:59.324
I have no intention
of doing that.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.660
My fate is too urgent.

04:04.162 --> 04:05.413
Then I will go there.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.542
And I will tell Lagertha about

04:09.626 --> 04:11.628
the avenging of
your father's death

04:12.795 --> 04:14.672
and the defeat of the Saxons.

04:14.756 --> 04:17.050
And the great gift of
land to our people.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.887
And tell my mother,

04:22.639 --> 04:24.265
and Torvi and the children

04:25.350 --> 04:26.768
that I think of them,

04:28.519 --> 04:29.854
and I will return...

04:32.565 --> 04:33.733
If the gods will it.

04:34.859 --> 04:35.902
<i>Skol.</i>

04:35.985 --> 04:37.528
<i>Skol.</i>

05:11.020 --> 05:13.022
This place is full of
ghostly memories.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.858
God help those who did this.

05:15.942 --> 05:18.820
If King Ecbert's body is here,
let us find it!

05:18.903 --> 05:21.322
Yes, Your Grace!

05:23.032 --> 05:24.117
Spread out!

05:24.200 --> 05:26.744
Captain!
Call your men forward!

05:26.828 --> 05:28.538
Search through there!

05:30.748 --> 05:32.083
Look for signs of life!

05:32.875 --> 05:34.377
Can we make
a search through here?

05:36.045 --> 05:37.922
Bring some more men!

05:39.090 --> 05:40.967
Yes! Five more!

05:41.050 --> 05:42.427
Forward!

05:43.803 --> 05:44.929
Tie it up!

05:48.558 --> 05:50.184
Time for food!

05:52.061 --> 05:53.771
We need to hurry!

05:54.856 --> 05:56.065
Put those in the front.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.650
- Take this!
- Be careful!

05:59.819 --> 06:01.696
- Do you have it?
- Another turn!

06:02.030 --> 06:03.072
Don't go away!

06:03.156 --> 06:04.449
You are sure?

06:06.284 --> 06:08.870
I don't understand why
you want to split with me.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.788
We're brothers.
We belong together.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.291
We've always had
the same dream.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.752
No. It's your dream.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.046
You want to be King of Norway.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.923
I don't have a dream
about being the brother

06:21.632 --> 06:23.217
of the King of Norway.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.803
Then what is your dream?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.806
I want to travel.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.101
I mean, what is your ambition?

06:32.185 --> 06:34.687
You have ambition enough
for the both of us, brother.

06:35.980 --> 06:36.981
I'm a simple fellow.

06:37.065 --> 06:39.525
Traveling to the ends of
the known world,

06:39.692 --> 06:41.027
that's enough for me!

06:45.198 --> 06:46.532
I will miss you.

06:50.328 --> 06:53.206
Everyone needs a brother
to cover their back.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.959
I'll still do that.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.004
Wherever I am.

07:12.642 --> 07:15.895
Go to your new boyfriend!
Be happy together!

07:19.857 --> 07:22.610
Tides are turning.
We have to leave.

07:36.207 --> 07:37.375
On the left.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.753
Only if we can use it!

07:41.879 --> 07:43.047
May as well pull it down.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.800
- Keep searching.
- We need a fire!

07:45.883 --> 07:47.510
It's destroyed,
it's no good.

07:47.593 --> 07:48.845
Salvage what you can!

07:48.928 --> 07:50.054
Pull it down!

07:50.138 --> 07:51.556
We might
be able to use that!

08:08.573 --> 08:10.074
I think we've found our King.

08:22.879 --> 08:23.921
Godforsaken people.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.383
Look what they've done.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.399
We must clean
and restore this place,

08:43.482 --> 08:45.318
despoiled by those
heathen barbarians.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.696
Tell the people who fled from
here that it's safe to return.

08:49.405 --> 08:50.656
Yes, Your Grace.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.078
Hyah! Hyah!

08:56.871 --> 08:58.247
Hah!

08:59.248 --> 09:00.416
Hyah!

09:04.212 --> 09:05.296
Walk on!

09:08.841 --> 09:10.301
Ah...

09:18.434 --> 09:19.435
Floki!

09:20.228 --> 09:22.647
Why are you building
a toy boat? Huh?

09:23.606 --> 09:24.857
It's not a toy.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.110
It's a one-man boat.

09:29.362 --> 09:32.573
I don't need the help of
anyone to sail it.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.785
And where do you think
you're going to sail it to?

09:39.705 --> 09:41.540
To where the gods decide.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.630
I don't want you to go.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.925
I still need you in the fight
against the Christians.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.762
My brothers are too soft
and you know that, Floki.

10:02.770 --> 10:03.938
Please?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.733
You know that
you are like my real father.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.779
No.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.662
Your real father
was Ragnar Lothbrok,

10:20.663 --> 10:22.832
the most famous man
in the world.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.796
Don't you ever forget that,
Ivar, or the gods will
punish you.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.342
Now let me
get on with my boat.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.644
You cannot leave me.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.733
My brothers...

10:51.777 --> 10:55.698
They don't believe that I
didn't mean to kill Sigurd.

10:57.116 --> 11:00.119
But I didn't want to.
He was my brother.

11:01.746 --> 11:02.955
Hmm?

11:04.290 --> 11:06.125
That is why you cannot leave.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.964
I will be too lonely.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.516
I have to leave, Ivar.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.063
With Helga gone, there's
nothing left for me here.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.609
This world no longer
interests me.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.362
That's why
I will submit myself

11:35.446 --> 11:36.864
to the tides and the winds,

11:36.947 --> 11:38.365
and the will of the gods,

11:39.158 --> 11:40.493
come what may.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.790
My heart is broken.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.086
It will repair.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.675
Ivar, the Boneless.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.845
Scourge of the world, hmm?

12:00.930 --> 12:02.389
You don't need me.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.776
Bring out the oars!

12:25.830 --> 12:27.081
Good luck!

12:27.164 --> 12:29.583
- Good luck!
- Safe return!

12:32.962 --> 12:34.130
Gods be with you!

12:36.799 --> 12:39.552
Row! Keep the pace!

12:39.635 --> 12:41.011
May Thor be
at your side!

13:10.624 --> 13:12.668
And so we commit the body
of Ecbert,

13:12.751 --> 13:15.588
King of Mercia
and Wessex, Bretwalda,

13:16.130 --> 13:17.882
King of Kings, to the earth.

13:18.591 --> 13:20.009
As the Lord sayeth,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.761
"I am the Resurrection
and I am the Life.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.931
"He who believes in me
though he is dead
will live on.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.893
"He who has life
and his faith in me,

13:29.351 --> 13:30.728
"to all eternity

13:31.270 --> 13:34.356
"will not die." Amen.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.108
Amen.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.239
Why did the Northmen
let you live?

13:42.323 --> 13:43.866
I don't know.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.534
I suppose they weren't
interested in me.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.746
So when I had a chance,
I ran away and hid.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.833
And what purpose did
you serve here?

13:53.709 --> 13:55.878
I transcribed and witnessed

13:55.961 --> 13:58.923
the treaty between King Ecbert
and the sons of Ragnar,

13:59.006 --> 14:00.507
whereby they were
granted the title

14:00.591 --> 14:02.009
to the lands of East Anglia.

14:06.722 --> 14:07.890
Even as he feared death,

14:08.015 --> 14:10.309
King Ecbert should have never
sold part of his inheritance

14:10.392 --> 14:11.602
to those pagans.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.146
He didn't.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.440
What do you mean?

14:17.399 --> 14:18.943
It wasn't his to sell.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.282
You had best explain yourself.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.827
Before he sent his family
away, King Ecbert

14:29.453 --> 14:33.207
renounced his crown in favor
of his son, Prince Aethelwulf.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.553
Then Aethelwulf is King,

14:47.388 --> 14:49.598
and the grant of
land worthless.

14:49.682 --> 14:50.808
Yes.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.810
The King is dead.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.647
Long live the King.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.666
They need
to dry here.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.959
Take that one.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.388
I would
use these nets.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.226
Edgar!

16:21.565 --> 16:22.649
How is he?

16:34.703 --> 16:35.788
Alfred.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.001
Is he dying?

16:46.131 --> 16:47.549
I don't know.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.597
I don't know.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.692
<i>It's just
as the Holy Father said.</i>

17:06.610 --> 17:09.696
God has sent the Northmen
here to scourge us,

17:09.780 --> 17:11.698
punish us for all our vanity,

17:11.782 --> 17:15.702
all our wickedness, all our
abominable iniquities.

17:16.745 --> 17:21.375
And how can you be so
sure, Aethelwulf?

17:24.628 --> 17:26.380
Because there's no other
way to understand

17:26.463 --> 17:27.714
what's happened to us.

17:30.426 --> 17:33.971
None.
Oh, of course.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.889
Of course, God!

17:35.973 --> 17:39.893
Alfred must...
Must die for our sins?

17:39.977 --> 17:41.019
For my sins!

17:42.980 --> 17:44.022
No!

17:46.150 --> 17:49.486
No one is without sin, Judith.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.655
And I can only pray

17:51.738 --> 17:54.658
that our Lord chooses to be
merciful to us,

17:55.492 --> 17:56.994
and bless us,

17:57.077 --> 18:00.330
and cause His face
to shine upon us again.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.949
You were planning to leave

18:36.033 --> 18:37.743
without telling us,
Floki, huh?

18:44.374 --> 18:47.294
I wanted to spare you
the trouble of trying
to stop me.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.046
But we will anyway.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.550
And you can't.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.138
So let us just say farewell
properly instead.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.140
Where are you going?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.100
Wherever the gods
will take me.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.562
But as long as I live
and breathe,

19:06.313 --> 19:07.314
you,

19:08.273 --> 19:09.691
the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok,

19:09.775 --> 19:11.193
will always be close
to my heart.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.285
Farewell, Floki.
Hmm.

19:21.245 --> 19:23.580
You are the greatest boat
builder of all time.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.211
Farewell, Floki.

19:30.671 --> 19:31.964
Beloved by the gods.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.225
You knock-kneed fool.

19:44.935 --> 19:45.936
Stay.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.606
We need you just as much
as our father needed you,

19:49.690 --> 19:52.150
but instead you choose to
run away, you coward.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.987
Stand up and say
that to my face!

20:12.129 --> 20:13.797
I will see you again.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.466
Is it true
he has completely

20:16.550 --> 20:18.093
committed himself to the sea?

20:19.845 --> 20:21.013
Do not worry.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.141
I have given him
the means to guide himself.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.228
We do not want him to be lost.

20:34.609 --> 20:35.819
Let Odin guide you!

20:41.533 --> 20:44.369
Floki! Farewell!

20:47.748 --> 20:49.708
All hail Floki!

20:49.791 --> 20:51.543
All hail Floki!

20:51.626 --> 20:55.881
All hail Floki!

21:03.513 --> 21:07.017
All hail Floki!
All hail Floki!

21:18.653 --> 21:21.073
Ecbert, our martyred king,

21:21.865 --> 21:23.241
hear my prayer.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.078
Let the wrath of God fall
upon these heathens

21:26.161 --> 21:28.246
who desecrate the holy places
of our land.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.500
Let them suffer at our hands.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.627
Slaughter them in battle.

21:34.753 --> 21:37.297
Cut them down like
the ears of corn at harvest.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.258
Let us rejoice in their ruin,

21:41.259 --> 21:43.887
and drive them back into
the sea from whence they came.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.640
And let God's holy church
arm itself

21:46.723 --> 21:48.642
against these worshippers
of the devil.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.061
And let this war never end,

21:51.478 --> 21:53.563
until not a single pagan lives

21:54.106 --> 21:55.232
or breathes.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.735
Ecbert, martyr,

21:59.361 --> 22:00.862
hear my prayer.

22:00.946 --> 22:01.988
Hear my prayer.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.490
Hallelujah.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.924
Do not be afraid.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.428
Christ is here.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.805
You are safe.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.101
Your Grace.
Your Grace.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.353
Your Grace.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.690
Your Grace. Thank you.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.025
Thank you.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.069
God bless you,
Bishop Heahmund.

22:41.570 --> 22:42.863
God bless you.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.492
Your Grace.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.119
Bless you, Your Grace.
Bless you.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.833
Speaking for our father,
I think we should claim

22:54.916 --> 22:56.710
and settle the land
given to us by Ecbert.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.129
The Saxons are in disarray.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.006
This is a good opportunity.

23:01.715 --> 23:05.218
We have the resources to
make a permanent settlement.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.013
Good.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.389
Do you agree, Ivar?

23:09.973 --> 23:11.808
I don't want to
disband the army.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.395
In fact, I want to continue
the war against the Saxons

23:15.479 --> 23:17.314
while we are still in
a position of strength.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.650
My suggestion is
that we go back north,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.194
to where we defeated Aelle.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.156
We should establish
a permanent camp, as you say,

23:26.823 --> 23:30.494
but near the coast, from where
we can raid wherever we want.

23:32.496 --> 23:36.416
Our father's dream was that
we wouldn't be just raiders.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.419
That we would behave
in a different way.

23:39.503 --> 23:42.964
You're not listening, Ubbe.
We have to have a stronghold.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.552
If we go north,
we are closer to our own lands

23:48.470 --> 23:49.930
and shipping routes.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.266
We can build
an impregnable fortress.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.018
Where?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.687
I've heard of
a town called York.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.025
It is built on a major river,

24:02.108 --> 24:04.110
and it is not far
from the sea.

24:04.194 --> 24:07.572
And I think that
we should take it.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.701
No. It would seem
like a withdrawal.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.370
Yes, yes, it would.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.872
But it is only tactical.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.210
Surely you understand, Ubbe,

24:20.293 --> 24:22.754
if we establish ourselves
in the middle of the country,

24:22.837 --> 24:24.548
then we are surrounded
by enemies.

24:25.006 --> 24:27.592
In York, we are nearer home.

24:29.928 --> 24:32.556
Right, Hvitserk?

24:37.352 --> 24:39.020
I agree with Ivar.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.147
We should go north
and attack York.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.613
It's good.

25:37.621 --> 25:38.997
Thank you, Ivar.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.934
That the last
of them?

26:03.438 --> 26:05.357
There's a lady in the church
needs to talk to you.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.199
Give us the strength,
which the world cannot give,

26:14.282 --> 26:16.034
with Your kindness,

26:17.869 --> 26:21.623
with mercy, and under
Thy protection. Amen.

26:21.956 --> 26:22.999
For whom do you pray?

26:24.084 --> 26:26.920
For all of us,
in these terrible times.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.548
What is your name?
Aethegyth.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.095
Aethegyth.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.390
You should consider
your own soul.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.394
Will you take Mass
at my hands?

26:46.314 --> 26:47.691
Then kneel.

27:30.442 --> 27:31.526
Amen.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.445
Amen.

27:44.122 --> 27:46.958
Lord, forgive this pitiful
and miserable sinner.

27:50.128 --> 27:53.798
I have sinned in thought
and in deed.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.595
Please forgive me,
three-person God.

28:00.054 --> 28:03.600
Punish me, ravish me!

28:05.393 --> 28:06.853
Cleanse me of my sin.

28:09.647 --> 28:10.857
Father.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.153
Father.

28:19.574 --> 28:22.368
York. Look at her.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.538
So ripe for plucking!

28:25.830 --> 28:27.832
And they don't even
know that we're here.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.335
I say we attack tomorrow
before they find out.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.504
Yes.
Hmm...

28:32.754 --> 28:33.880
Wait.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.757
I remember something
our father said.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.010
It was always better to attack
an English town

28:39.093 --> 28:41.513
when they are celebrating
one of their Saint's Days.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.139
On those days,
most of the people

28:43.223 --> 28:45.266
will either be in church
or they will be drunk.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.352
So how do we find out?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.064
We'll find a way.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.567
All right.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.349
Hmm?

30:19.736 --> 30:20.737
Er...

30:44.761 --> 30:47.305
Now, we must make a sacrifice.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.683
Northmen!
Ready your bows!

31:31.933 --> 31:33.309
- The walls!
- Prepare!

31:36.688 --> 31:37.689
- Ready.
- Ready your bows!

31:37.772 --> 31:38.856
Stand up, men!

31:39.399 --> 31:40.525
Down!

31:45.530 --> 31:47.031
You two, move!

32:20.064 --> 32:21.357
Charge!

32:38.249 --> 32:40.585
Hyah! Hyah!

32:49.969 --> 32:51.429
Hyah! Hyah!

35:47.813 --> 35:48.981
Shh, shh, shh.

35:50.650 --> 35:53.736
<i>Domine...</i>

35:58.366 --> 35:59.617
No!

37:00.219 --> 37:01.721
Hold his head.

37:01.804 --> 37:02.972
Hold it.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.187
Take his head.

37:45.181 --> 37:46.223
Horse!

37:46.849 --> 37:49.351
Hyah! Hyah!

38:12.124 --> 38:13.501
To you, my brothers.

38:14.585 --> 38:16.003
And to our town of York.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.215
To York.

38:21.592 --> 38:22.927
And to all our brothers,

38:24.261 --> 38:25.805
not forgetting Sigurd.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.776
To all of us!

38:39.527 --> 38:40.861
<i>Skol.</i>

38:44.406 --> 38:45.658
<i>Skol.</i>

39:30.828 --> 39:31.829
Oh!

39:42.840 --> 39:44.466
Enough. Enough.

39:47.928 --> 39:49.138
Oh!

39:50.347 --> 39:52.600
You are almost too
strong for me, Guthrum.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.061
You need someone else
to train with.

39:57.730 --> 39:59.899
You must remember your father
was a great warrior.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.692
He still is
a very great warrior.

40:01.775 --> 40:03.068
I don't mean Bjorn.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.696
I mean your real father,
Jarl Borg.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.907
It is a name you must be
proud of, and never forget.

40:08.991 --> 40:10.784
And even though
Ragnar killed him,

40:11.493 --> 40:13.245
I know in my heart
that they are now fighting

40:13.329 --> 40:14.955
and feasting together
in Valhalla.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.043
Ships!

40:31.388 --> 40:32.681
Who are they?

40:36.852 --> 40:38.145
I have to warn Lagertha.

41:39.790 --> 41:43.752
Queen Lagertha,
I bring wonderful news.

41:44.878 --> 41:48.132
The Great Army, led by
your son Bjorn Ironside,

41:48.215 --> 41:52.052
succeeded in avenging the
death of Ragnar Lothbrok.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.265
Both King Aelle
and King Ecbert are dead,

41:56.348 --> 41:59.101
but not before King Ecbert
gave us a great gift of land

42:00.227 --> 42:02.021
for future settlement.

42:04.732 --> 42:06.984
You've done well to tell
me this, King Harald.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.069
But why did my son
not bring the news?

42:09.528 --> 42:11.780
- Is he dead?
- Oh, no.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.326
Of Ragnar's sons,
only Sigurd is dead,

42:15.409 --> 42:18.746
killed by his
own brother, Ivar.

42:25.002 --> 42:29.465
Then I ask again,
why is Bjorn not here?

42:30.674 --> 42:32.968
He told everyone
he wished to sail

42:33.052 --> 42:34.803
straight back
to the Mediterranean,

42:34.887 --> 42:38.557
and asked me to convey
his respects to you,

42:39.224 --> 42:41.977
his mother, and to Torvi,

42:43.062 --> 42:45.147
the mother of his children.

42:48.692 --> 42:51.653
Now tell me why you've really
come here, King Harald.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.656
I told you.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.368
Since your own son

42:57.451 --> 42:59.828
refused to bring you
the news of our affairs,

43:00.871 --> 43:02.247
I thought I should do it.

43:04.583 --> 43:08.712
And I thought that perhaps you
wanted to find out how well

43:08.796 --> 43:11.090
Egil the bastard
had served you.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.929
Perhaps you expected
to find him here,

43:18.055 --> 43:19.556
sat upon the throne,

43:20.974 --> 43:23.227
keeping it warm for you?

43:26.688 --> 43:28.315
Perhaps I did.

43:35.239 --> 43:40.035
The truth can be a bad choice
for a wise man.

43:44.123 --> 43:47.668
I have never been accused
of being wise.

43:47.751 --> 43:50.295
Even so, I never
took you for a fool.

43:51.046 --> 43:52.631
But you know what they say,

43:52.714 --> 43:56.760
"If a fool persists in his
folly, he can become wise."

43:59.763 --> 44:01.557
The gods may not
give you the time.

44:05.978 --> 44:07.396
I cannot blame the gods.

44:08.689 --> 44:10.190
They gave me so much else.

44:11.483 --> 44:12.985
So much else.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.662
I'm happy to die.

44:33.672 --> 44:35.007
Don't be afraid.

44:36.508 --> 44:37.593
Strike.

44:42.347 --> 44:43.515
Strike!

44:46.810 --> 44:47.978
Strike!
