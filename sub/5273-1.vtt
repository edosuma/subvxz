00:14.275 --> 00:18.301
To escape from a car that goes belly-up underwater.

00:18.302 --> 00:19.862
It was absolutely the scariest thing

00:19.863 --> 00:21.043
I have ever done on this show.

00:21.044 --> 00:22.797
10 on the brown-pants index.

00:22.798 --> 00:24.548
And an explosive movie myth

00:24.549 --> 00:27.257
sets the scene for chaos in the kitchen...

00:29.300 --> 00:31.601
Holy moly!

00:31.602 --> 00:33.932
...As Tory, Grant, and Kari

00:33.933 --> 00:37.876
try stopping a gun from igniting a roomful of gas

00:37.877 --> 00:41.989
by, believe it or not, shooting through milk.

00:43.976 --> 00:45.189
Well... you shot the milk.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.639
That's for sure.

00:49.454 --> 00:51.630
Who are the Mythbusters?

00:51.849 --> 00:53.092
Adam savage...

00:53.093 --> 00:54.442
It's a delicious memory.

00:54.443 --> 00:55.954
...And Jamie Hyneman.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.504
When in doubt, c-4.

00:58.326 --> 01:02.739
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.700
Joining them... Tory belleci...

01:05.701 --> 01:07.258
All in the name of science.

01:07.259 --> 01:08.719
...Grant Imahara...

01:08.720 --> 01:10.351
Something just touched me!

01:10.352 --> 01:11.647
...And Kari Byron...

01:11.648 --> 01:12.745
This should be fun.

01:12.746 --> 01:14.995
They don't just tell the myths.

01:15.532 --> 01:18.295
They put them to the test.

01:27.804 --> 01:29.512
We got a problem. What's that?

01:29.513 --> 01:30.541
Well, you remember when we filmed

01:30.542 --> 01:32.335
the underwater-car episode a few years ago?

01:32.336 --> 01:34.386
The one where you nearly died inside the car?

01:34.387 --> 01:35.369
Exactly.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.769
It turns out that we might not have gone far enough

01:37.770 --> 01:38.988
in our testing that episode.

01:38.989 --> 01:40.729
We repeatedly had me escape

01:40.730 --> 01:42.897
from a car sinking like this,

01:42.898 --> 01:45.911
in this position, upright, when it turns out...

01:45.912 --> 01:47.617
We've heard from a lot of fans and professionals...

01:47.618 --> 01:49.232
that most cars, when they go in the drink,

01:49.233 --> 01:50.853
actually don't sink like that.

01:50.854 --> 01:52.833
They actually do what's called turning turtle.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.729
They go all the way upside down and sink like that.

01:55.730 --> 01:56.746
And so what's the difference?

01:56.747 --> 01:59.503
Well, supposedly it's far more disorienting

01:59.504 --> 02:02.539
and much more difficult to get out of an upside-down car.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.333
And so you figure that the techniques you used last time

02:05.334 --> 02:06.894
to get out of the car wouldn't work so well.

02:06.895 --> 02:09.681
Yeah, that's exactly what we've got to find out.

02:10.488 --> 02:12.500
Coming up to my ankles.

02:12.501 --> 02:15.635
The first time we tried, the results were clear-cut.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.774
If the water's just up to your ankles,

02:17.775 --> 02:19.762
it's easy to exit the car.

02:19.763 --> 02:21.301
Freedom!

02:21.403 --> 02:23.761
But when it passes your knees,

02:23.762 --> 02:27.026
the pressure disparity between inside and out

02:27.027 --> 02:30.397
means you'll have to wait till the car fills with water,

02:30.398 --> 02:33.139
then open the door and swim to safety.

02:33.788 --> 02:34.776
Whoo!

02:35.556 --> 02:38.543
But those tests were done right-side up,

02:38.544 --> 02:40.923
and according to operation star...

02:40.924 --> 02:44.004
that's submerged transport accident research...

02:44.005 --> 02:47.016
cars sinking water deeper than 14 feet

02:47.017 --> 02:49.380
nearly always turn turtle.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.916
So, where do we start?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.324
Well, it seems that there are two main problems

02:53.325 --> 02:54.663
with the upside-down sinking car.

02:54.664 --> 02:56.951
The first is that when the car turns over,

02:56.952 --> 02:58.276
you get totally disoriented

02:58.277 --> 03:00.646
and don't know which way is up or down.

03:00.647 --> 03:01.362
Okay.

03:01.363 --> 03:03.746
The second is that it's much harder

03:03.747 --> 03:04.765
to wait for the car to fill up

03:04.766 --> 03:07.126
when your air pocket is where your feet are.

03:07.127 --> 03:09.646
Let's start with disorientation. I have an idea.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.525
Okay.

03:12.173 --> 03:15.209
This is Jamie's wheel of misfortune,

03:15.210 --> 03:18.809
a man-sized hamster tumbler that's purpose-built

03:18.810 --> 03:22.368
to not only disorit Adam, but to work underwater.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.178
This is it.

03:24.678 --> 03:28.715
Adam will come and stand here like so,

03:28.952 --> 03:31.651
and I'll rotate him around and around,

03:31.652 --> 03:35.404
and when I stop, he can just freely come out like this,

03:35.405 --> 03:39.327
and he'll swim off in whatever direction he thinks is up.

03:40.239 --> 03:41.696
It's a straightforward plan

03:41.697 --> 03:44.776
that needs just one more thing... h2o...

03:44.814 --> 03:46.113
and plenty of it.

03:46.114 --> 03:47.900
Okay, off to the pool.

03:47.901 --> 03:50.562
They'll need at least 8 feet of water,

03:50.563 --> 03:54.176
and this dive school's got 10 in the deep end.

03:55.087 --> 03:57.148
Let me explain how this thing's gonna break down.

03:57.149 --> 04:00.158
Jamie and I will walk the disorientation rig into the pool

04:00.159 --> 04:01.799
and set it on the bottom.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.985
Once it's in place, Jamie will position himself next to the rig

04:04.986 --> 04:06.049
in full scuba gear,

04:06.050 --> 04:08.148
and I will swim down to it...

04:08.623 --> 04:11.322
Put my feet on the paddles, put my hands on the handles,

04:11.323 --> 04:13.830
and put on a pair of blindfold goggles

04:13.831 --> 04:15.772
that completely negate my ability to see.

04:15.773 --> 04:18.918
When I'm ready, Jamie will begin spinning, spinning, spinning me.

04:18.918 --> 04:21.261
I'll have no idea which direction I'll end up in,

04:21.262 --> 04:23.354
but when he stops, he'll tap the rig twice,

04:23.355 --> 04:27.876
and I will swim whichever direction I think is up.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.505
And if your car crashes at night...

04:30.506 --> 04:32.057
hence the blindfold...

04:32.058 --> 04:35.206
that could be a whole lot harder than it sounds.

04:37.906 --> 04:40.655
You know when you're hanging upside down on the monkey bars

04:40.656 --> 04:43.601
and the blood rushes to your head and you feel that pressure?

04:43.864 --> 04:45.014
I didn't expect this,

04:45.015 --> 04:47.960
but I could feel that pressure underwater, too.

04:48.547 --> 04:51.617
After 30 seconds of blindfolded spinning,

04:51.618 --> 04:53.494
Jamie sets Adam adrift,

04:53.495 --> 04:55.399
and without hesitation,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.720
he heads straight for the surface.

04:59.969 --> 05:02.193
In the name of due diligence,

05:02.194 --> 05:05.169
they try it again...And again...

05:08.054 --> 05:10.229
With exactly the same result.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.603
Ha! Found up again.

05:15.378 --> 05:17.041
You're three for three, huh?

05:17.653 --> 05:19.951
I am. I think it's your turn to try this rig out.

05:19.952 --> 05:20.722
I'm game.

05:20.723 --> 05:22.061
All right, let's do it.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.826
Adam's efforts are a kick in the teeth for the myth,

05:26.827 --> 05:31.636
so let's see if Jamie's internal compass survives the big spin.

05:31.849 --> 05:34.512
He'll also do it three times over.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.642
We came here to find out if it was possible

05:39.643 --> 05:41.903
to lose your sense of direction underwater,

05:42.150 --> 05:44.137
and based on our testing,

05:44.138 --> 05:47.297
my feeling is that while there are a lot of cues

05:47.298 --> 05:48.570
to tell you which way is up,

05:48.571 --> 05:51.193
it's really quite easy to get distracted.

05:52.044 --> 05:53.035
That last escape

05:53.036 --> 05:55.768
left Jamie geographically embarrassed,

05:55.769 --> 05:58.687
so the concept of losing your way upside down

05:58.688 --> 06:01.563
now looks like it might hold water.

06:02.502 --> 06:03.362
So, what do you think?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.512
I think it's all about presence of mind,

06:05.513 --> 06:07.424
because on one of the tests,

06:07.425 --> 06:09.493
I was having problems with my sinuses,

06:09.494 --> 06:10.816
and I got a little distracted.

06:10.817 --> 06:14.113
And for just a moment when you stopped the rotation,

06:14.114 --> 06:16.153
I had no idea which way was up.

06:16.154 --> 06:18.054
So you think, given all the distractions

06:18.055 --> 06:20.348
of a car accident, your car going into the drink,

06:20.349 --> 06:22.181
that there really might be something to this?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.671
Yeah, I mean, you're in shock,

06:23.672 --> 06:26.210
and given a lack of any prominent cues,

06:26.211 --> 06:28.124
I don't think you'd have any way to tell.

06:28.898 --> 06:31.935
That puts confirming the myth right back in play,

06:31.936 --> 06:34.322
but it's also Adam's too-easy it

06:34.323 --> 06:36.635
that gives him pause for thought.

06:36.636 --> 06:38.519
That tells me something significant.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.533
It says that in the interest of eliminating variables,

06:40.534 --> 06:41.834
we might have actually created

06:41.835 --> 06:44.784
too sterile a testing procedure.

06:44.785 --> 06:47.884
That tells me we need one that's less sterile.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.242
We need one that's dirtier.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.897
We need to do this in a real car.

06:55.228 --> 06:58.654
Now to a myth that pits milk against methane,

06:58.655 --> 07:00.439
with a gun in between.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.189
All right, we got an explosive myth this time.

07:03.190 --> 07:03.763
Great.

07:03.764 --> 07:05.926
This one comes from the movie "kiss the girls."

07:05.927 --> 07:07.324
Cop faces off with the bad guy

07:07.325 --> 07:10.588
in a kitchen full of gas from the stove.

07:10.589 --> 07:12.271
And the cop wants to shoot the bad guy,

07:12.272 --> 07:14.184
but the bad guy reminds him, "if you shoot me,

07:14.185 --> 07:16.817
"the muzzle flash from your gun will ignite the gas,

07:16.818 --> 07:19.176
blowing up the kitchen and killing them both."

07:20.838 --> 07:23.492
The bad guy's already snapped the gas line.

07:23.842 --> 07:25.642
And he's holding a cigarette lighter.

07:25.643 --> 07:27.449
The cop needs to shoot him,

07:27.450 --> 07:29.666
but he thinks that the flash from the gun

07:29.667 --> 07:31.628
might also ignite the methane.

07:31.629 --> 07:35.290
So he shoots, with success, through the milk.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.212
But can shooting through liquid

07:37.213 --> 07:40.815
really stop the muzzle flash from igniting the gas?

07:41.253 --> 07:42.638
All right, so, what's the plan?

07:42.639 --> 07:44.303
May I suggest we simply go for it?

07:44.304 --> 07:46.668
I mean, build a kitchen, fill it full of gas,

07:46.669 --> 07:49.245
shoot the gun from the movie once into milk and once not?

07:49.246 --> 07:50.480
That's great, and then we'll see

07:50.481 --> 07:53.288
if it does, in fact, ignite the gas and blow up the kitchen.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.796
So, to test the myth that a milk carton

07:58.797 --> 08:01.060
will prevent a gun's muzzle flash

08:01.061 --> 08:02.961
from igniting a room full of methane,

08:02.962 --> 08:04.937
we need to blow up a kitchen.

08:05.037 --> 08:06.687
But since none of us are willing

08:06.688 --> 08:08.859
to volunteer our own personal kitchens,

08:08.860 --> 08:10.366
weeed to build one.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.460
Now, we're gonna be filling this kitchen up with methane gas.

08:13.461 --> 08:15.687
We don't really know how big of an explosion

08:15.688 --> 08:17.523
we're gonna get when we ignite the gas,

08:17.524 --> 08:20.481
so we're building the kitchen out of plywood and 2x4s.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.610
That way we won't have any metal shrapnel.

08:22.810 --> 08:25.018
But most importantly, one of the walls

08:25.019 --> 08:28.008
is gonna be made out of a breakaway plexiglas

08:28.009 --> 08:30.771
so that way we can see what's going on inside the kitchen,

08:30.772 --> 08:34.384
and when the gases are ignited, that wall will pop off,

08:34.385 --> 08:37.652
releasing that pressure wave so we don't get a huge explosion.

08:37.914 --> 08:39.904
But even a mid-range explosion

08:39.905 --> 08:43.402
might just smash the windows and singe the neighbors.

08:43.652 --> 08:46.376
So the kit kitchen is flat-packed and delivered,

08:46.377 --> 08:49.164
some assembly required, to the local bomb range.

08:53.714 --> 08:56.535
Sometimes the best order of procedure is to just go for it,

08:56.536 --> 08:59.026
I mean, find out if we have any merit to the myth at all...

08:59.027 --> 09:00.870
just straight out to the bomb range,

09:00.871 --> 09:03.689
recreate the circumstances, and blow the thing up.

09:03.690 --> 09:06.800
Custom-made cabinets. Time to hang them.

09:07.238 --> 09:09.716
To properly restage this movie myth,

09:09.717 --> 09:12.511
they'll need more than four walls and a roof.

09:12.512 --> 09:15.373
This is a gorgeous stove/sink combo you've picked out.

09:15.374 --> 09:18.087
We'll be cooking with gas in no time.

09:18.126 --> 09:19.315
With lines like that,

09:19.316 --> 09:21.242
we'll need some top-notch actors,

09:21.243 --> 09:23.152
and here's our leading man.

09:23.153 --> 09:25.275
Come on. It's time to go to work.

09:25.276 --> 09:26.311
It's hard to believe,

09:26.312 --> 09:29.621
but this sack of bones is our Morgan Freeman.

09:29.622 --> 09:32.140
I know. I feel this way every morning, too.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.737
As for Buster, well, he's been typecast again.

09:38.738 --> 09:41.450
Okay, handcuffs, just like the guy in the movie.

09:42.276 --> 09:44.088
See, that looked like I knew what I knew what I was doing.

09:49.014 --> 09:51.184
Now they're ready to dial up the danger

09:51.185 --> 09:52.974
with things that go bang...

09:53.287 --> 09:57.249
the gun...And the gas.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.525
All right, get ready for a big boom.

10:02.900 --> 10:03.915
After the break,

10:03.916 --> 10:06.953
we'll see if going straight to a full-scale kitchen

10:06.954 --> 10:09.119
was really such a hot idea.

10:18.370 --> 10:21.134
Kari, Grant, and Tory are preparing to see

10:21.135 --> 10:24.125
if shooting through milk can really stop a gun

10:24.126 --> 10:26.366
from igniting a roomful of methane.

10:31.591 --> 10:34.148
Now, in the movie, the gas line attached to the stove breaks,

10:34.149 --> 10:35.927
so we know it's natural gas.

10:35.928 --> 10:39.424
Now, natural gas is about 85% methane gas,

10:39.425 --> 10:41.257
which is very flammable.

10:41.258 --> 10:42.782
But there's a twist...

10:42.783 --> 10:45.892
it's only flammable in certain concentrations.

10:45.893 --> 10:49.817
Too little methane means not enough fuel for the fire.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.635
But add too much methane,

10:51.636 --> 10:55.600
and there's not enough oxygen molecules to sustain combustion.

10:55.601 --> 10:56.948
The numerical balance

10:56.949 --> 10:59.439
of different substances to cause a reaction

10:59.440 --> 11:03.509
is called stoichiometry, and Grant's done his homework.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.704
So, we know that the perfect stoichiometric ratio

11:05.705 --> 11:07.974
of methane in air is 5% to 15%,

11:07.975 --> 11:11.265
so we're gonna go right in the middle... say 10%.

11:11.266 --> 11:14.233
And with this volume, which is about 500 cubic feet,

11:14.234 --> 11:16.698
we're shooting for 50 cubic feet of methane.

11:16.699 --> 11:18.998
With the guys and the gun from the movie

11:18.999 --> 11:21.689
and the carton of milk set in place,

11:21.690 --> 11:25.385
we're ready to see if this myth is just Hollywood hokum.

11:25.386 --> 11:27.902
We're going to fire the gun through the milk

11:27.903 --> 11:28.819
and see what happens.

11:28.820 --> 11:32.606
Now, if it works out like the hero thinks and nothing happens,

11:32.607 --> 11:34.309
then we're going to try it again,

11:34.310 --> 11:36.149
this time without the milk,

11:36.150 --> 11:38.957
and then we'll see if the room goes up like, "whoosh."

11:40.038 --> 11:42.836
To get the right balance of methane to air,

11:42.837 --> 11:45.582
they turn on the gas for just 90 seconds.

11:45.583 --> 11:49.085
All right, filling up the kitchen with methane gas,

11:49.086 --> 11:50.873
one and a half minutes.

11:51.719 --> 11:53.443
So here's how it stands.

11:53.444 --> 11:55.064
If the kitchen explodes,

11:55.065 --> 11:58.339
it's an instant and absolute myth busted.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.487
All right, this is methane gas with gun and milk.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.855
In three, two, one.

12:06.882 --> 12:09.661
Well... you shot the milk.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.849
That's for sure.

12:14.007 --> 12:17.031
No explosion. Maybe this myth is true.

12:17.256 --> 12:20.791
So, with milk, there was no gas-room boom,

12:20.792 --> 12:22.593
which is good news for the myth.

12:22.594 --> 12:26.192
But what if the mixture of methane and air was wrong

12:26.193 --> 12:29.096
and the room is basically incombustible?

12:29.097 --> 12:30.606
Well, it's easy to test,

12:30.607 --> 12:33.877
because Grant had the foresight to add a road flare

12:33.878 --> 12:35.903
hooked up to an electric match.

12:35.904 --> 12:39.071
Here we go with the flare, in three, two, one.

12:43.693 --> 12:44.984
Hey, we got something.

12:44.985 --> 12:45.885
We got ignition.

12:45.886 --> 12:48.138
The flare not only proves a point,

12:48.139 --> 12:50.864
it clears the air of the flammable gas.

12:52.051 --> 12:55.351
So far, it looks like our villain was wrong.

12:57.912 --> 12:59.817
With the gun and the milk,

12:59.818 --> 13:01.287
there was no explosion.

13:01.288 --> 13:04.637
But would the gun alone have sparked a blast anyway?

13:04.638 --> 13:06.713
It's time to reload.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.350
All right, so kitchen is filling.

13:10.201 --> 13:13.412
As soon as we hit a minute and 30 seconds,

13:13.638 --> 13:14.626
fire the gun.

13:14.774 --> 13:16.677
You think the milk stopped the muzzle flash?

13:16.678 --> 13:17.835
You think it's gonna explode?

13:17.836 --> 13:20.085
I don't know, but we're about to find out.

13:20.086 --> 13:23.872
We sure are, in around about three, two...

13:23.873 --> 13:24.722
One.

13:25.928 --> 13:30.176
With the muzzle flash unmuffled by milk, nothing happened.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.745
Okay. All right, no explosion.

13:31.746 --> 13:35.098
If the scene in the movie was based on hard science,

13:35.099 --> 13:38.864
that single shot should have triggered a massive explosion.

13:39.064 --> 13:43.168
Now to fire the flare to confirm that the gas mix was right.

13:46.501 --> 13:49.763
So we were at the right ratio.

13:53.251 --> 13:56.908
Yet the bullet did not ignite the methane gas.

13:56.909 --> 13:59.735
Which means the milk did not stop the muzzle flash

13:59.736 --> 14:01.451
from lighting the methane gas.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.869
The bad news for this myth

14:07.870 --> 14:10.182
is that this did not happen

14:10.183 --> 14:11.992
because of muzzle flash from a gun.

14:11.993 --> 14:13.869
This happened because of a flare.

14:13.870 --> 14:16.400
So what we need to do now is figure out

14:16.401 --> 14:19.239
what exactly is going on with this myth

14:19.240 --> 14:23.283
and what can possibly cause a roomful of methane to go up.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.394
Up next, Adam and Jamie

14:25.395 --> 14:29.470
with a car-sinking rig that should take your breath away.

14:29.471 --> 14:31.357
There's a lot of moving parts to this one.

14:36.845 --> 14:38.956
That pool test was actually pretty interesting.

14:38.957 --> 14:40.121
Yeah, it was.

14:40.122 --> 14:41.450
There was just a brief moment

14:41.451 --> 14:43.395
when I was distracted by my sinuses,

14:43.396 --> 14:45.426
and I honestly didn't know which way was up.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.459
So you think there might

14:47.460 --> 14:49.630
actually be something to this story?

14:49.631 --> 14:50.215
Yeah.

14:50.216 --> 14:53.160
Then I don't think there's anything to do now but go full-scale.

14:53.866 --> 14:55.523
Adam and Jamie have figured

14:55.524 --> 14:57.783
the only fair way to test their myth

14:57.784 --> 15:00.074
is to put Adam inside a real car

15:00.075 --> 15:03.602
and drop man and machine in a real lake.

15:05.552 --> 15:08.997
Well, I am standing on the edge of pit 232,

15:08.998 --> 15:11.496
a former quarry lake in sunny ione, California,

15:11.497 --> 15:14.002
which may look familiar to the careful viewer,

15:14.126 --> 15:15.958
because we've shot a couple stories here before.

15:15.959 --> 15:18.426
Right out there in the middle, we did this.

15:22.451 --> 15:25.288
And then right over there is the ramp where we did this.

15:32.634 --> 15:35.559
Now we are about to do this...

15:36.084 --> 15:38.921
All right, I only have a couple more breaths here.

15:41.883 --> 15:43.096
...Except this time,

15:43.097 --> 15:45.491
we are adding an extra wrinkle of jeopardy

15:45.492 --> 15:47.763
just to make sure we've covered all our bases.

15:47.764 --> 15:51.608
It's time to sink an upside-down car with me in it.

15:56.983 --> 15:57.819
Let's face it.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.062
A car like this could only benefit

16:00.063 --> 16:01.581
from being dropped in a lake.

16:01.582 --> 16:05.326
Time will tell if the same holds true for Adam.

16:05.327 --> 16:08.220
That's perfect. We can lower it down.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.993
In the interests of relative safety and good science,

16:11.994 --> 16:15.184
they won't launch the car "Dukes of Hazzard" style

16:15.185 --> 16:17.181
off a ramp and into the drink.

16:18.236 --> 16:22.218
Instead, to guarantee that the car turns turtle,

16:22.219 --> 16:23.703
they'll use a barge...

16:24.829 --> 16:25.990
A tow truck...

16:26.415 --> 16:30.378
Six empty barrels... and more rope than a rodeo.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.416
Here's the plan in a nutshell.

16:32.828 --> 16:34.857
Okay, so, we're gonna tie a rope

16:34.858 --> 16:36.210
to the back bumper of our test car

16:36.211 --> 16:37.847
on a barge in the middle of the lake.

16:37.848 --> 16:40.962
The other end of that rope goes to a pickup truck on the shore

16:40.963 --> 16:43.637
which, at the correct signal, will drive forward,

16:43.638 --> 16:45.490
pulling our test car off the barge.

16:45.491 --> 16:47.595
Now, our test car, being a normal car with an engine,

16:47.596 --> 16:48.633
is front-heavy,

16:48.634 --> 16:51.392
and its front will hit the water and start sinking.

16:51.393 --> 16:53.408
What we're hoping is the forward momentum

16:53.409 --> 16:57.095
of the pickup truck pulling our test car from the rear end

16:57.096 --> 17:01.138
will actually pull it all the way over until it's upside down.

17:01.363 --> 17:02.495
Just to make sure the car

17:02.496 --> 17:04.214
doesn't plunge to the very bottom of the lake,

17:04.215 --> 17:08.796
we've got six 55-gallon drums making sure that it's secure

17:08.797 --> 17:11.355
at a relatively safe depth of 15 feet.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.962
It's as risky a stunt as they've ever attempted,

17:14.963 --> 17:18.492
so Jamie's understandably fussing the detail.

17:20.867 --> 17:22.387
Given that this is a one-shot deal,

17:22.387 --> 17:24.761
we're gonna weld guide rails onto this barge

17:24.762 --> 17:26.378
so that we know for sure

17:26.491 --> 17:29.087
that the car enters the water the way it's supposed to.

17:29.088 --> 17:31.160
Remember, Adam's inside this thing,

17:31.161 --> 17:35.112
and so if it goes off the barge cockeyed or anything goes wrong,

17:35.113 --> 17:36.828
it might not be pretty.

17:43.765 --> 17:45.541
Equally ugly is the prospect

17:45.542 --> 17:47.896
of sinking all the way to the bottom.

17:47.921 --> 17:50.242
They've welded and strapped tight

17:50.243 --> 17:52.858
two clusters of three empty barrels

17:52.859 --> 17:55.640
to halt the descent at 15 feet under,

17:55.641 --> 17:56.909
just over the depth

17:56.910 --> 18:00.512
where the star report says most cars turn turtle.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.305
Will it work? Let's ask a buoyancy boffin.

18:03.306 --> 18:06.462
Well, our car weighs about 2,600 pounds,

18:06.463 --> 18:08.763
and half of it is tied to the barge I'm standing on,

18:08.764 --> 18:11.809
so I only need to support 1,300 pounds of the car

18:11.810 --> 18:13.185
with these barrels.

18:13.186 --> 18:18.108
Each one of them displaces 440 pounds of water,

18:18.109 --> 18:19.956
'cause a pint's a pound the world around.

18:19.957 --> 18:23.813
All told, that gives me 2,500 pounds of buoyancy

18:23.814 --> 18:25.734
for 1,300 pounds of car.

18:25.735 --> 18:27.740
That's well within my safety margin.

18:27.741 --> 18:29.188
That's enough flotation.

18:29.236 --> 18:31.671
Just like last time, they've removed the engine

18:31.672 --> 18:35.228
so oils and sundry fluids don't Sully the water.

18:36.570 --> 18:40.840
Making up for the lost mass are twelve barbell weights...

18:41.382 --> 18:43.495
Assuming they ever get there.

18:43.845 --> 18:45.281
Hey, Jamie? Yeah?

18:45.282 --> 18:47.807
I need your help. It's too heavy.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.069
I have it on good authority that it's not that bad.

18:51.357 --> 18:52.083
Go for it.

18:52.084 --> 18:53.102
But the weight in the barrow

18:53.103 --> 18:55.517
is much the same as a whole car engine,

18:55.518 --> 18:58.564
so Adam wisely resorts to hand delivery.

18:58.565 --> 19:00.818
Last two. Thank you, Adam.

19:00.851 --> 19:03.069
That's the last of the heavy lifting,

19:03.070 --> 19:06.963
and it's time for the s.S. Poseidon to push off.

19:07.763 --> 19:09.853
I bet if you could see into Jamie's brain right now,

19:09.854 --> 19:13.249
he's reminiscing about being a barge driver on the erie canal,

19:13.250 --> 19:14.627
back when it first opened.

19:14.628 --> 19:16.577
The barge drifts into place

19:16.578 --> 19:19.509
at a spot where the water is 50 feet deep.

19:19.510 --> 19:21.734
Adam's next job is to secure

19:21.735 --> 19:23.827
those flotation barrels to the car.

19:23.828 --> 19:27.887
Now it's time to attach the lifeline, my safety system...

19:27.888 --> 19:30.782
the four ropes that will suspend this car upside down

19:30.783 --> 19:33.303
exactly 15 feet below the surface of the water.

19:33.304 --> 19:34.992
We've isolated that the worst-case scenario

19:34.993 --> 19:36.085
for this experiment

19:36.086 --> 19:37.913
is that the car somehow detaches

19:37.914 --> 19:39.456
from all four of its mooring points,

19:39.457 --> 19:42.609
sinks to the bottom upside down so deep in the silty mud

19:42.610 --> 19:46.376
that neither my safety diver nor I can open the doors.

19:46.651 --> 19:50.357
If that happens, we will have to sit down there long enough

19:50.358 --> 19:52.567
for safety divers with salvage bags

19:52.568 --> 19:55.637
to lift the car enough to open the door and free us.

19:55.638 --> 19:57.051
Between you and me...

19:58.275 --> 19:59.571
Even though we've accommodated for that,

19:59.572 --> 20:00.875
I hope it doesn't happen.

20:01.150 --> 20:03.608
Coming up, the rescue crew readies

20:03.609 --> 20:06.016
as Adam prepares to take the plunge.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.377
It is now...

20:09.702 --> 20:10.752
...Or never.

20:18.539 --> 20:19.849
Now, just to recap,

20:19.850 --> 20:21.686
we filled a kitchen with methane gas,

20:21.687 --> 20:22.950
fired a gun into milk.

20:22.951 --> 20:24.684
It did not ignite the gas.

20:25.071 --> 20:26.955
We removed the milk, fired again.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.971
It still did not ignite the gas.

20:29.134 --> 20:31.491
So we need to move on to small scale

20:31.492 --> 20:33.654
and find out if it's even possible

20:33.655 --> 20:37.383
to ignite methane gas using the muzzle flash from a gun.

20:38.234 --> 20:41.363
Before the milk part of this myth can be restaged,

20:41.364 --> 20:43.252
they need to show that a flash

20:43.253 --> 20:45.302
from the handgun used in the movie

20:45.303 --> 20:47.583
could blow up a room in the first place.

20:47.584 --> 20:48.795
Okay, that's a hole.

20:51.228 --> 20:53.142
It failed on the bomb range,

20:53.143 --> 20:55.872
but this test, in a bulletproof box,

20:55.873 --> 20:58.227
filmed in super slow motion,

20:58.228 --> 21:01.328
should at least shed some light on the subject.

21:01.940 --> 21:03.649
All right, here's what's going on with the muzzle flash

21:03.650 --> 21:06.045
and why it might actually ignite a roomful of gas.

21:06.046 --> 21:07.539
Now, when a gun is fired,

21:07.540 --> 21:10.710
only about 30% of the chemical energy from the propellant

21:10.711 --> 21:12.331
is converted to the kinetic energy

21:12.332 --> 21:14.465
that is the projectile moving down the barrel.

21:14.466 --> 21:18.034
The rest is contained in the propellant-gas-particle mixture

21:18.035 --> 21:19.900
that escapes from the muzzle of the gun.

21:19.901 --> 21:22.154
A significant proportion of that is dissipated

21:22.155 --> 21:24.773
into that bright muzzle flash that you see.

21:24.774 --> 21:26.540
All right, so, for this size kitchen,

21:26.541 --> 21:28.335
I'm only gonna fill it up for two seconds.

21:28.336 --> 21:30.454
Filling up kitchen with methane.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.129
All right, that should be good.

21:34.130 --> 21:35.321
Kari counts down...

21:35.322 --> 21:38.341
Shooting the gun in three, two, one.

21:39.409 --> 21:42.134
...To another big, fat failure.

21:47.361 --> 21:51.033
It takes a keen eye to even spot the muzzle flash.

21:51.034 --> 21:53.130
All right, so the gun fires, and if you look here,

21:53.131 --> 21:55.530
there is one frame of muzzle flash.

21:55.531 --> 21:58.152
Yeah, that's only a quarter of a millisecond.

21:58.153 --> 22:01.047
And that's not nearly enough ignition energy

22:01.048 --> 22:02.981
to spark a kitchen inferno.

22:02.982 --> 22:05.549
Maybe it's time to upgrade the sidearm.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.603
I want to know if a gun can ignite the gas.

22:07.604 --> 22:08.986
Do you think another gun could do this?

22:08.987 --> 22:10.471
Maybe a hotter load.

22:10.472 --> 22:13.050
Yeah, hotter load, bigger muzzle flash, sure.

22:13.051 --> 22:14.799
That might work. Let's try it.

22:15.512 --> 22:18.842
A hot load means more powder in the cartridge,

22:18.843 --> 22:22.148
but there's also a very good reason to switch guns.

22:22.149 --> 22:24.454
We're having no luck igniting our gas

22:24.455 --> 22:27.157
with the gun that the hero carried around in the movie,

22:27.158 --> 22:29.181
but there's a little Hollywood mistake here.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.985
Though the hero was carrying a sig sauer

22:30.986 --> 22:32.366
throughout the entire movie,

22:32.367 --> 22:34.651
the villain said he was holding a glock.

22:34.652 --> 22:36.211
So that's what we're testing next,

22:36.212 --> 22:38.867
and just for good measure, we're using a hotter load.

22:39.086 --> 22:41.648
The hot load is called a +p,

22:41.649 --> 22:45.042
so let's see if a new round and the right gun

22:45.043 --> 22:46.548
can get the job done.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.335
Okay, loaded.

22:51.073 --> 22:52.197
All right, we're hot.

22:52.574 --> 22:55.193
All right, you guys ready?

22:55.194 --> 22:59.343
Here we go, in three, two, one.

23:02.143 --> 23:04.379
Again, no explosion,

23:04.380 --> 23:07.780
so Kari burns off the gas with an electric match.

23:11.362 --> 23:13.420
Now it's back to the high-speed

23:13.421 --> 23:16.579
to check what was way too quick for the naked eye.

23:16.580 --> 23:19.426
Wow. Look at how much bigger the muzzle flash is.

23:19.427 --> 23:21.025
Yeah, but we still didn't get ignition.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.914
So it's not looking so good for the movie myth,

23:22.915 --> 23:26.076
but I do really want to see a gun light the gas.

23:26.077 --> 23:27.722
I think we're gonna need a bigger gun.

23:27.723 --> 23:30.508
And possibly an even hotter load.

23:32.158 --> 23:35.981
And this being "Mythbusters," we do have some options.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.994
We're going big... really big...

23:39.369 --> 23:41.231
.44 Magnum big.

23:41.569 --> 23:44.413
As we found in Adam and Jamie's myth "handgun horror,"

23:44.414 --> 23:46.505
the flash comes not only out of the muzzle,

23:46.506 --> 23:48.806
but here, where the cylinder is.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.484
When you need significant muzzle flash,

23:54.485 --> 23:56.747
this is what you call on.

23:56.748 --> 24:00.197
It stands to reason that this round in this gun

24:00.198 --> 24:03.059
should spark the biggest flash so far,

24:03.060 --> 24:06.585
and right now, it's all about igniting the gas.

24:07.553 --> 24:09.828
All right, gun's loaded and cocked.

24:11.796 --> 24:14.342
Of course, if this fails, well,

24:14.343 --> 24:17.830
might be time to have a stern word with the screenwriter.

24:19.030 --> 24:19.718
Okay, ready.

24:19.719 --> 24:22.567
Shooting in three, two, one.

24:27.054 --> 24:29.529
Dang. No ignition.

24:29.661 --> 24:31.711
Man, that was a big muzzle flash.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.271
All right, let's go check out the high-speed.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.072
Yeah.

24:34.978 --> 24:36.052
Good thinking.

24:36.053 --> 24:38.320
There's nothing like watching your failures

24:38.321 --> 24:40.077
in super slow motion.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.121
Even with the larger load, which has more powder,

24:44.122 --> 24:46.041
we're still not able to ignite the methane.

24:46.042 --> 24:48.644
So I think we've moved past the movie myth at this point.

24:48.645 --> 24:50.645
I think we need the essence of this myth,

24:50.646 --> 24:53.374
which is that a gun can light a roomful of gas

24:53.375 --> 24:54.995
and that milk can stop it.

24:54.996 --> 24:56.205
So where do we go?

24:56.206 --> 24:58.207
The myth is busted.

24:58.208 --> 25:01.436
Not even the .44 Magnum could spark the methane.

25:01.437 --> 25:03.879
But the team still has high hopes

25:03.880 --> 25:06.911
of a gunshot exploding a roomful of gas.

25:06.912 --> 25:10.060
If they manage to do that, they're right back on track

25:10.061 --> 25:14.955
to see if a carton of ordinary milk can prevent a catastrophe.

25:20.267 --> 25:21.306
Back on the barge,

25:21.307 --> 25:25.185
Adam's immersed in a tangle of sheepshanks and bowlines.

25:26.295 --> 25:29.382
If it looks like a lonely pursuit, you're right.

25:29.383 --> 25:32.406
But he's not doing this just to calm his nerves.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.082
Well, not exactly.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.665
Why am I doing all this by myself?

25:35.666 --> 25:39.482
Well...To me, it's axiomatic...

25:39.483 --> 25:42.432
if your life depends upon the rigging,

25:42.970 --> 25:44.144
do your rigging.

25:45.773 --> 25:46.729
While I'm sitting there

25:46.730 --> 25:48.660
waiting for this car to drop over the edge,

25:48.922 --> 25:51.671
I'm gonna be going through the rigging in my mind

25:51.672 --> 25:54.624
about a hundred times, and I'm gonna want to be able

25:54.625 --> 25:56.101
to picture the whole thing in my brain,

25:56.102 --> 25:57.857
so I might as well do it myself.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.425
That knot right there

26:10.426 --> 26:14.496
is gonna pull this car to its final resting place,

26:14.783 --> 26:16.083
but hopefully not me.

26:18.820 --> 26:21.841
Worst-case scenario here is that both Adam and our safety diver

26:21.842 --> 26:26.295
get knocked out cold from all of this violence in this impact.

26:26.870 --> 26:28.203
I don't think that's gonna happen,

26:28.204 --> 26:31.846
but...That'd be a bad thing if it does.

26:31.847 --> 26:33.710
But enough of the doom and glowm.

26:33.711 --> 26:36.705
The whole point of this test is to save lives

26:36.706 --> 26:40.309
if and when the unthinkable happens to you.

26:40.459 --> 26:42.145
We've already done a full episode

26:42.146 --> 26:43.635
on a car going into the water...

26:46.133 --> 26:46.982
Here we go.

26:47.258 --> 26:48.553
...Moreover, an episode

26:48.554 --> 26:51.232
that is one of, I think, our proudest moments,

26:51.233 --> 26:53.115
given that four separate fans have written to us

26:53.116 --> 26:54.766
and said that watching that episode

26:54.767 --> 26:57.442
gave them critical information that allowed them to escape

26:57.443 --> 26:59.051
when their car went underwater.

27:00.614 --> 27:02.472
Well, it's because of turning turtle.

27:02.473 --> 27:05.259
It's because fans wrote to us and said that most cars

27:05.260 --> 27:07.868
going in the water turn completely over,

27:07.869 --> 27:11.450
and even though we've sunk a car in the water a dozen times,

27:11.451 --> 27:12.559
we wanted to know what happens

27:12.560 --> 27:14.841
when that car goes completely upside down.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.368
Do you become so disoriented

27:16.369 --> 27:18.219
that it becomes much harder to escape?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.342
And how, then, do you escape?

27:20.343 --> 27:22.587
That's what we're gonna answer with this setup.

27:22.813 --> 27:26.291
If the myth is correct and escape is impossible,

27:26.292 --> 27:30.461
emergency air supplies are fitted fore and aft.

27:30.636 --> 27:31.611
That's good.

27:32.810 --> 27:36.345
All right, I'm gonna turn this off for right now. Yeah.

27:36.346 --> 27:38.014
Remember to turn it on. I will.

27:38.015 --> 27:38.952
Okay.

27:39.352 --> 27:41.256
I think we're pretty much ready to go.

27:41.257 --> 27:42.577
I don't think that's going anywhere...

27:42.578 --> 27:43.813
I don't think so.

27:43.814 --> 27:45.739
...Except into the water with you.

27:54.416 --> 27:57.032
Sliding into the backseat is diver don.

27:57.033 --> 28:01.490
If things really go badly, he's there to save Adam's life.

28:01.702 --> 28:05.610
This is meant to be much harder than when he was right side up,

28:05.611 --> 28:08.276
and once again, he'll wrench on the doors,

28:08.277 --> 28:12.118
maybe kick at the windows, and try to stay calm.

28:12.119 --> 28:14.561
So, what are the various outcomes likely to mean in this test?

28:14.562 --> 28:17.401
Well, if I get to the surface

28:17.402 --> 28:20.273
by either breaking the window or resorting to breathable air,

28:20.274 --> 28:22.235
then I would say the fans are totally right.

28:22.236 --> 28:25.331
However, if I'm able to maintain my cool

28:25.332 --> 28:27.435
and actually get to the surface without breaking the window,

28:27.436 --> 28:28.508
without resorting to air,

28:28.509 --> 28:30.388
just by holding my breath and staying calm,

28:30.389 --> 28:32.340
then I would say that the fans are wrong.

28:32.341 --> 28:34.663
And in either case, we have illuminated

28:34.664 --> 28:36.982
a whole new feature of cars going into water.

28:37.332 --> 28:38.252
Straight ahead,

28:38.253 --> 28:40.635
the perils of cooking with hydrogen.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.601
Holy moly!

28:42.602 --> 28:45.444
But can milk still save the day?

28:54.964 --> 28:56.247
Three, two, one.

28:56.248 --> 28:58.756
In the myth of the gas-room boom,

28:58.757 --> 29:03.356
pure methane has proved, well, let's say uncooperative.

29:03.507 --> 29:05.230
Okay, methane's not exploding,

29:05.231 --> 29:07.923
but that's a good thing because it's in people's houses.

29:07.924 --> 29:09.871
I don't thinink this myth s actually gonna get anywhere

29:09.872 --> 29:11.549
unless we move on to a more explosive gas.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.593
What about hydrogen?

29:12.594 --> 29:16.023
It's got a lower ignition energy than methane... 1/15th...

29:16.024 --> 29:20.418
and its flammability range in air is 5% to 75%.

29:21.479 --> 29:22.948
Roomful of gas, all that?

29:22.949 --> 29:25.485
Remember, the myth that they're trying to test

29:25.486 --> 29:28.395
is if milk can suppress a muzzle flash

29:28.396 --> 29:31.440
and prevent an explosion of volatile gas.

29:31.441 --> 29:34.340
But with methane, the gas used in the movie,

29:34.341 --> 29:36.389
they got nowhere fast.

29:36.390 --> 29:39.683
So now they've changed up to hydrogen.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.909
Now, in these next tests, we're gonna use the same guns...

29:41.910 --> 29:45.147
the 9mm glock and the 9mm sig sauer,

29:45.148 --> 29:46.985
plus the .44 Magnum.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.485
The only thing that's gonna change this time is the gas.

29:49.486 --> 29:50.445
We're using hydrogen.

29:50.446 --> 29:53.168
It's more flammable, so hopefully one of these

29:53.169 --> 29:54.517
will get that gas to ignite.

29:54.518 --> 29:56.790
Starting off with the sig sauer,

29:56.791 --> 29:57.509
they're trying to find

29:57.510 --> 30:00.152
the perfect gun-and-round combination...

30:00.153 --> 30:01.304
All right, we're locked and loaded.

30:01.305 --> 30:03.825
...To ignite the gas without milk,

30:03.826 --> 30:07.125
and then add the milk to see if it stops the explosion.

30:07.126 --> 30:09.057
All right, filling the tank.

30:13.482 --> 30:14.503
Okay, you fire,

30:14.504 --> 30:16.360
and then I'm gonna flame if it doesn't ignite.

30:16.361 --> 30:19.104
Here we go in three, two, one.

30:23.066 --> 30:25.865
Oh, my gosh. It just ignited the gas.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.204
I can't tell. I think we need to check the high-speed.

30:28.541 --> 30:30.078
Always a good plan,

30:30.129 --> 30:33.203
as Tory's wishful thinking comes to nothing.

30:33.204 --> 30:36.120
The gun went off. The gas didn't.

30:36.121 --> 30:37.970
Even with the more flammable gas,

30:37.971 --> 30:40.870
it still was not enough to be ignited by the muzzle flash.

30:40.871 --> 30:42.873
Hey, we're just starting. We got another gun.

30:42.874 --> 30:43.690
All right.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.009
So, next up is the gun

30:46.010 --> 30:49.301
they said they used in the movie but actually didn't...

30:49.302 --> 30:50.731
the glock 17.

30:50.732 --> 30:51.970
All right, so, we are about to fire

30:51.971 --> 30:55.478
a high-velocity round out of a glock into the hydrogen.

30:55.703 --> 30:58.259
Now, we saw when we fired it into the methane

30:58.260 --> 31:01.210
that the higher velocity round had a bigger muzzle flash,

31:01.211 --> 31:03.225
but I still don't think it's gonna be enough

31:03.226 --> 31:04.930
to ignite that hydrogen gas.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.263
If Tory's right,

31:06.264 --> 31:09.969
this myth might soon die with a whimper, not a bang.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.918
Grant agrees, and he's worked up a theory.

31:13.093 --> 31:16.146
What I think is happening is there's a pressure wave

31:16.147 --> 31:18.211
that's pushing all the gas out of the way,

31:18.212 --> 31:21.742
and the part that might ignite it is never meeting the gas.

31:21.743 --> 31:24.623
So you know what? I think this is never gonna happen.

31:24.624 --> 31:27.912
But you know what they say about famous last words.

31:27.913 --> 31:29.079
Fudge.

31:32.997 --> 31:36.103
God. I...Think that ignited the gas.

31:36.104 --> 31:37.234
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

31:37.235 --> 31:40.401
Wow. Holy moly!

31:40.402 --> 31:43.496
Didn't see that one coming.

31:49.417 --> 31:50.542
Oh, my gosh.

31:50.543 --> 31:54.319
This myth is looking very plausible.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.718
I guess I was wrong.

31:57.867 --> 32:01.179
There's no doubt that was a blast and a half.

32:01.180 --> 32:05.021
The tank is in pieces, and so is the high-speed camera.

32:05.022 --> 32:08.559
There is a lot of energy right there. A lot.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.697
But did you see? That is incredible.

32:10.698 --> 32:15.578
The gas was ignited from the muzzle flash.

32:19.165 --> 32:21.322
All I know is when Kari pulled the trigger,

32:21.323 --> 32:25.019
the blast was so large that I was stunned.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.533
I didn't know what to say.

32:26.534 --> 32:29.077
I was just sort of sitting there blinking, like, "ohh."

32:30.214 --> 32:31.647
So they've finally nailed

32:31.648 --> 32:34.133
the right bullet, the gun, and the gas.

32:34.134 --> 32:36.219
But it still bodes no good

32:36.220 --> 32:38.481
for that key scene from "kiss the girls."

32:38.482 --> 32:40.380
Well, it's busted as far as the movie goes,

32:40.381 --> 32:42.145
'cause nobody's cooking with hydrogen.

32:42.146 --> 32:43.248
But the question is,

32:43.249 --> 32:46.363
if the essence of this myth is gun igniting gas,

32:46.364 --> 32:48.352
can milk stop that?

32:48.353 --> 32:51.422
Well, maybe we should clean up, reset, and try some milk.

32:51.673 --> 32:53.873
We definitely have to take this full-scale.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.077
But filling a full-sized room

32:57.078 --> 32:59.959
would take 75 times more hydrogen

32:59.960 --> 33:01.690
than they used in the small tank,

33:01.691 --> 33:04.571
and that's way too dangerous, even for us.

33:04.572 --> 33:07.209
So the boys have gone mid-scale...

33:07.534 --> 33:11.958
not too big, not too small, and not too shabby.

33:13.771 --> 33:15.120
Look at that, Kari.

33:15.121 --> 33:16.414
We made you a Dollhouse...

33:16.415 --> 33:17.650
Oh, my gosh.

33:17.651 --> 33:20.087
...That we're gonna fill up with hydrogen and blow up.

33:20.088 --> 33:21.752
Oh, my gosh, I want to keep this.

33:21.753 --> 33:22.907
That's adorable.

33:22.908 --> 33:25.811
She can, but it won't be in mint condition.

33:25.812 --> 33:28.427
This is way more volatile than the methane.

33:28.428 --> 33:32.541
The "h" in h-bomb stands for hydrogen.

33:32.766 --> 33:35.708
Now, if the milk actually does stop the muzzle flash

33:35.709 --> 33:37.353
from igniting the little kitchen,

33:37.354 --> 33:38.772
we have a backup glock

33:38.773 --> 33:41.015
because we know it can actually do it with muzzle flash.

33:41.016 --> 33:42.801
That's a lot more exciting than a candle.

33:44.226 --> 33:44.949
In effect,

33:44.950 --> 33:47.893
the second glock now takes the place of the road flare.

33:47.894 --> 33:50.422
They raise both guns towards the roof

33:50.423 --> 33:54.035
just in case the ultralight hydrogen settles at the top.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.687
While Kari rolls out the remote trigger cords,

33:59.688 --> 34:00.955
Tory and Grant install

34:00.956 --> 34:03.980
the see-through roof and the front wall.

34:04.130 --> 34:07.743
And, after ensuring a nice, tight seal...

34:08.817 --> 34:11.292
Filling the kitchen now. Here we go.

34:11.810 --> 34:13.949
...Tory counts up to 60,

34:13.949 --> 34:17.254
which should fill the room with six cubic feet of gas...

34:17.255 --> 34:19.052
enough to blow it to pieces.

34:19.053 --> 34:21.897
That's assuming the milk muffler doesn't work.

34:21.898 --> 34:23.922
This one's for all the marbles.

34:24.902 --> 34:27.172
All right, the kitchen's filled with hydrogen for a minute.

34:27.172 --> 34:28.315
We are ready to go.

34:28.928 --> 34:32.340
In three, two, one.

34:35.143 --> 34:37.521
There's no need to shoot twice.

34:37.522 --> 34:40.014
Even with milk at the end of the barrel,

34:40.014 --> 34:43.797
the flash from the gun made the room go boom.

34:44.260 --> 34:45.121
Busted.

34:45.121 --> 34:46.090
Busted.

34:46.091 --> 34:47.954
So it looks like the milk is not enough

34:47.955 --> 34:50.996
to stop the muzzle flash from igniting the hydrogen.

34:51.188 --> 34:54.121
They've not only busted the myth from the movie

34:54.121 --> 34:57.913
but also smashed the idea of milk stopping a blast

34:57.914 --> 35:00.459
in a room that's been properly primed.

35:02.843 --> 35:04.106
Busted.

35:07.030 --> 35:09.080
Blew this kitchen apart.

35:09.081 --> 35:11.121
And there's shrapnel 25 feet back.

35:11.122 --> 35:13.235
Yeah, there is milk everywhere.

35:13.236 --> 35:16.492
Clearly, milk is not gonna be the thing that stops the explosion.

35:18.642 --> 35:21.014
Well, it sure doesn't work with hydrogen.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.928
As for the methane, it never exploded at all,

35:23.929 --> 35:27.361
so Morgan had no cause to fret in the first place.

35:27.362 --> 35:28.429
Sure, he had the right idea,

35:28.430 --> 35:30.369
if they were cooking with hydrogen gas.

35:30.370 --> 35:31.443
I mean, we had to go to a gas

35:31.444 --> 35:34.431
with such a low ignition energy that it's ridiculous.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.378
We're busted on so many levels.

35:38.003 --> 35:41.139
In the meantime, remember it's very uncool

35:41.140 --> 35:44.415
to mess with methane... or to waste milk.

35:46.917 --> 35:51.224
Still to come, well, it's about the amazing Adam savage,

35:51.225 --> 35:53.821
underwater and upside down.

35:53.822 --> 35:55.629
I can't open the passenger door.

36:02.237 --> 36:04.243
Adam and Jamie are finally ready

36:04.244 --> 36:08.007
to turn one of their classic experiments upside down.

36:08.008 --> 36:11.809
My goal here is to go underwater, turn turtle,

36:11.810 --> 36:13.227
and get back to the surface

36:13.228 --> 36:17.123
without either breaking a window or resorting to breathable air.

36:17.388 --> 36:20.411
But can he stay calm enough long enough

36:20.412 --> 36:23.016
to make his escape when the car's belly-up?

36:23.017 --> 36:24.899
Mike, go ahead and start your engine.

36:25.825 --> 36:27.282
We're about to find out.

36:27.283 --> 36:28.811
In three...

36:30.173 --> 36:31.211
Two...

36:33.936 --> 36:35.861
One...Go.

36:47.337 --> 36:49.622
The plan works to perfection

36:49.623 --> 36:51.955
as the car pitches nose first

36:51.956 --> 36:54.563
and then settles roof-side down.

36:54.825 --> 36:57.911
Adam's initial fears are unfounded.

36:57.912 --> 37:01.737
Both he and don are so far uninjured.

37:01.738 --> 37:03.986
All right, the car's filling up.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.698
Whoa. It's definitely totally upside down.

37:06.699 --> 37:09.285
All our safety procedures are working great.

37:09.286 --> 37:10.783
It's slowly filling up.

37:10.784 --> 37:13.546
I'm definitely not gonna try for the driver's-side door.

37:13.547 --> 37:15.700
I'm gonna try for the passenger door.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.550
I can't open the passenger door.

37:19.997 --> 37:23.922
Of course I can't, because we're still sinking...

37:24.072 --> 37:26.022
the pressure differential.

37:26.247 --> 37:27.846
Whoo! That was totally intense.

37:27.847 --> 37:30.334
The windshield shattered from the impact.

37:31.147 --> 37:34.733
We're still about 30 seconds from having turned over.

37:34.734 --> 37:36.708
My safety diver, don... are you okay?

37:36.709 --> 37:38.010
Excellent.

37:38.147 --> 37:39.577
Inside the car,

37:39.578 --> 37:43.032
the pressure, in every sense, is rapidly rising.

37:43.033 --> 37:46.645
But back on the surfac Jamie's almost buoyant.

37:46.646 --> 37:49.887
Well, I can hear Adam making all sorts of noise inside there.

37:49.888 --> 37:51.064
I don't know what he's saying,

37:51.065 --> 37:54.894
but he appears to still be awake and intact.

37:54.895 --> 37:55.735
It's true.

37:55.736 --> 37:58.878
Right now, Adam's unhurt, unfazed,

37:58.879 --> 38:00.721
and surprisingly chatty.

38:00.722 --> 38:02.354
Waiting for the car to fill up

38:02.355 --> 38:04.121
so that I can open this door and escape.

38:04.122 --> 38:07.865
Right now I can actually see out the ck window.

38:07.866 --> 38:09.014
I can see daylight,

38:09.015 --> 38:12.158
which is really pretty tantalizing, honestly.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.642
It's crucial that Adam stays calm,

38:14.643 --> 38:18.533
especially as a massive curve ball is coming his way.

38:18.534 --> 38:22.758
The upside-down car suddenly twists right side up.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.246
Oh. Whoa!

38:25.471 --> 38:27.199
The car's turned over again. All right.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.722
And it might turn over again once we get down,

38:29.723 --> 38:33.162
because of the lines we've got on it.

38:33.163 --> 38:35.380
I'm gonna try and open thihihihs with all my might.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.268
Ugh! No.

38:38.654 --> 38:41.429
Okay, stay calm.

38:42.404 --> 38:46.741
Wow. The windshield is totally spraying water out at me.

38:48.551 --> 38:49.445
Whoo!

38:49.691 --> 38:52.965
Dude, I did not expect this.

38:52.966 --> 38:54.647
With each passing second,

38:54.648 --> 38:56.294
the car fills with water,

38:56.295 --> 38:58.569
but Adam does at least manage to stay

38:58.570 --> 39:00.228
with the last pocket of air.

39:00.229 --> 39:02.277
Let me see if I can open this door.

39:02.415 --> 39:06.890
Ugh. No. I have no access to any door that's in this.

39:06.891 --> 39:09.338
I have to wait until this car settles down.

39:09.339 --> 39:12.114
It is taking a long time to sink.

39:12.115 --> 39:14.076
To Adam it's taking forever,

39:14.077 --> 39:14.872
but, in fact,

39:14.873 --> 39:18.263
it's only 60 seconds since the car hit the water.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.898
But things are about to accelerate.

39:20.899 --> 39:23.863
Okay, there's a lot to get caught up in in this car,

39:23.864 --> 39:25.571
and my visibility's about to disappear.

39:25.572 --> 39:26.392
Here we go.

39:31.154 --> 39:34.503
I can hear the last bit of air hissing out the back of the car,

39:34.504 --> 39:38.394
so these guys are pretty close to being totally in the water,

39:38.395 --> 39:39.903
and the car's gonna be going down.

39:39.979 --> 39:42.568
And sure enough, just seconds later...

39:42.569 --> 39:45.813
It... it's going down.

39:46.321 --> 39:47.408
Here we go.

39:49.269 --> 39:50.244
Oh, boy.

39:51.413 --> 39:52.931
"Oh, boy," is right,

39:52.932 --> 39:56.018
as the car suddenly drops like a stone.

39:56.019 --> 39:59.857
It flips yet again, so it's back upside down.

40:00.619 --> 40:03.751
Remember that Adam's not wearing a dive mask,

40:03.752 --> 40:06.669
so his vision is even more blurred than this.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.406
What's more, there's no air pockets left.

40:14.443 --> 40:16.965
After a worrying period of silence,

40:16.966 --> 40:18.843
Adam finally breaks free.

40:21.155 --> 40:24.703
He figures out which way is up and swims to safety.

40:25.594 --> 40:27.826
But did he really survive,

40:27.827 --> 40:31.190
or did he resort to a blast of emergency air?

40:33.614 --> 40:34.377
Oh!

40:35.002 --> 40:37.459
You all right? I'm okay.

40:37.460 --> 40:40.779
It's pretty definitive that I died right there.

40:40.780 --> 40:44.183
That means you had to partake of the onboard air supply?

40:44.184 --> 40:46.888
I absolutely had to partake of the onboard air supply.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.888
And I breathed in a little water on the way.

40:51.573 --> 40:52.748
With the car turning

40:52.749 --> 40:54.599
and being really unpredictable with its turning,

40:54.600 --> 40:57.120
which I think was actually quite accurate

40:57.121 --> 40:58.606
to a real-world scenario...

40:58.955 --> 41:01.267
Oh, the car's turned over again. All right.

41:01.268 --> 41:03.813
...My air pocket was changing constantly,

41:03.814 --> 41:08.084
and when it finally started to lurch and go under at the end,

41:08.085 --> 41:10.012
it went really, really, really fast.

41:10.013 --> 41:12.460
I had about 10, 15 seconds of warning,

41:12.461 --> 41:14.320
trying to take a really deep breath,

41:14.321 --> 41:15.752
and then I tried opening the door,

41:15.753 --> 41:17.731
and at that point, I was completely out of air.

41:17.732 --> 41:19.652
It was just too stressful.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.657
You're in this super confined space.

41:21.658 --> 41:22.909
You cannot see anything.

41:22.910 --> 41:24.377
You can't... you lose all your bearings.

41:24.378 --> 41:26.322
I mean, I couldn't find the handles on the doors

41:26.323 --> 41:27.435
without a mask.

41:27.436 --> 41:28.977
His only choice

41:28.978 --> 41:31.671
was to take the air offered by diver don,

41:31.672 --> 41:33.928
and don had his own problems.

41:33.929 --> 41:36.051
My safety diver was actually pinned in his seatbelt

41:36.052 --> 41:39.252
and had to use a knife to actually cut himself free.

41:39.514 --> 41:41.280
The whole time I was underwater breathing air,

41:41.281 --> 41:43.339
I couldn't tell you what part of the car I was in

41:43.340 --> 41:45.453
or what direction was up or down.

41:45.653 --> 41:48.463
The disorientation was complete.

41:49.063 --> 41:51.285
They both lived to tell the tale,

41:51.286 --> 41:54.537
but Adam only got out with the help of canned air.

41:54.538 --> 41:57.791
So the myth that it's next to impossible to escape

41:57.792 --> 42:01.285
when the car turns turtle is confirmed.

42:05.660 --> 42:08.096
The essence of Adam's approach to survival

42:08.097 --> 42:11.243
was exactly the same as the first time around...

42:11.244 --> 42:14.787
stay as calm as you can for as long as you can.

42:16.674 --> 42:19.310
Staying put till the car fills with water

42:19.311 --> 42:21.273
is still the best tactic,

42:21.274 --> 42:23.367
but the fans were dead right.

42:23.368 --> 42:27.348
Getting out is a whole lot harder when you're upside down.

42:27.648 --> 42:29.359
The difference between this test

42:29.360 --> 42:32.331
and the first time we did this with an upright car

42:32.332 --> 42:34.177
is literally night and day.

42:34.178 --> 42:35.897
So the take-home message is...

42:35.898 --> 42:37.161
I don't know about you,

42:37.162 --> 42:39.091
but I am keeping a commercial window breaker

42:39.092 --> 42:40.872
in my glove compartment from now on.

42:40.873 --> 42:42.378
Unless you live in the desert.

42:42.379 --> 42:43.410
Exactly.

42:43.797 --> 42:45.783
And remember that, technically,

42:45.784 --> 42:47.950
Adam would have drowned in that car.

42:47.951 --> 42:50.346
So if he's recommending a window breaker,

42:50.347 --> 42:53.871
all I can say is the man knows his business.
