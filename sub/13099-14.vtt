WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:04.750
[dramatic music]

00:10.708 --> 00:13.083
Merchandising?
We're being merchandised?

00:13.167 --> 00:14.500
You can't be serious, sir.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.667
I heard this was in the works
a few weeks ago.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.125
I fought against it and lost.

00:19.208 --> 00:22.583
The B5 Senate Oversight
Committee was asked to study

00:22.667 --> 00:25.750
ways to help us become
more self-sufficient.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.917
Their studies indicate that
the sale of merchandise relating

00:29.000 --> 00:31.792
to Babylon 5 system wide

00:31.875 --> 00:34.542
could generate a projected
two million credits

00:34.625 --> 00:37.208
'over the next year, earmarked
for our operating budget.'

00:37.292 --> 00:38.833
Why don't they
just open up a gift shop?

00:38.917 --> 00:40.208
Well, that's exactly
what they're doing

00:40.292 --> 00:41.667
'down in the Zocalo right now.'

00:41.750 --> 00:44.000
'It will sell to, uh, residents'

00:44.083 --> 00:45.792
tourists, visiting VIPs

00:45.875 --> 00:48.333
anyone who wants
a gift for themselves

00:48.417 --> 00:49.625
or for the folks back home.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.583
You know, uh,
dolls, jackets, toys.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.458
Welcome to Babylon 5, your last
best hope for a quick buck.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.333
- Commander--
- Well, this is demeaning.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.625
I mean, we're not some,
some deep-space franchise.

00:59.708 --> 01:01.125
This station is about something.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.625
That's why
I'm putting you in charge

01:02.708 --> 01:04.500
to oversee this gift shop

01:04.583 --> 01:07.458
which, I might add,
is only a test at this point.

01:07.542 --> 01:08.875
Why me?

01:08.958 --> 01:11.167
- I hate this whole idea.
- Exactly.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.000
I'm counting on you to focus
that hostility with your typical

01:14.083 --> 01:17.167
diligence to make sure that
this station and its inhabitants

01:17.250 --> 01:21.292
are in no way, as you so
correctly put it, demeaned.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.958
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.792
Now, if you'll excuse me
I have to meet with

01:28.875 --> 01:30.667
Ambassador Kosh
down in the Zocalo

01:30.750 --> 01:33.583
for another one of his lessons
that should help us

01:33.667 --> 01:35.667
understand each other better.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.667
- What is he teaching you today?
- I'm not exactly sure.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.167
And I probably won't know any
better even after the lesson.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.833
- 'Oh, uh, commander.'
- Yes, sir.

01:44.917 --> 01:48.167
While you're handling
this whole store situation..

01:48.250 --> 01:50.750
...could you see if they have
any baseball caps.

01:52.667 --> 01:55.042
For my sister.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.708
[scoffs]

01:58.250 --> 02:00.792
[instrumental music]

02:05.417 --> 02:07.542
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Sorry.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.167
No, no, no problem.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.208
My link.

02:13.292 --> 02:16.292
Hey! Hey, you! Come back here!

02:19.125 --> 02:21.000
Son of a..

02:25.833 --> 02:27.542
Sorry.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.583
[grunting]

02:37.167 --> 02:38.250
Alright.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.208
Now, that's enough.
Get back!

02:41.292 --> 02:42.833
Death first.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.292
[grunts]

02:44.375 --> 02:46.792
[groans]

02:47.917 --> 02:49.542
[panting]

02:52.333 --> 02:55.208
[intense music]

03:03.833 --> 03:08.958
(Sheridan)
The Babylon Project was our
last best hope for peace.

03:09.042 --> 03:12.208
A self-contained world,
five miles long

03:12.292 --> 03:14.375
located in neutral territory.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.750
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:19.833 --> 03:23.625
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:23.708 --> 03:26.792
A shining beacon in space

03:26.875 --> 03:28.917
all alone in the night.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.458
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:32.542 --> 03:36.708
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:36.792 --> 03:40.917
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.125
The year is 2259.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.375
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.625
[theme music]

04:32.917 --> 04:34.208
There was nothing I could do.
He jumped me.

04:34.292 --> 04:35.708
He was reaching for a weapon.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.833
No weapon was found on the body.

04:37.917 --> 04:39.667
No, but when somebody
makes a move like that

04:39.750 --> 04:41.250
if you wait long enough to find
out if he's carrying or not

04:41.333 --> 04:42.708
you're usually dead.

04:42.792 --> 04:46.875
Lavell, the deceased, came from
a highly-respected family.

04:46.958 --> 04:50.833
This is a shocking incident.
My government will want answers.

04:50.917 --> 04:54.250
Look, maybe he thought I was
attacking him. I don't know.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.833
One minute he was in my way,
and the next..

04:58.917 --> 05:01.375
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.500
These are perilous times.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.542
We must do all we can to avoid
another conflict

05:06.625 --> 05:08.708
between our people
over a misunderstanding.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.208
He was trying to kill me.

05:10.292 --> 05:12.000
I think I understood
that pretty clearly.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.125
But why?

05:13.208 --> 05:14.792
For what it's worth, ambassador
my people

05:14.875 --> 05:16.250
are already investigating.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.917
I have been
asked by my government

05:18.000 --> 05:20.042
to conduct my own
investigation as well.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.792
Independently of yours.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.542
Well, I won't stop you,
of course.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.375
Now that would be
a real duplication of effort.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.083
We could get in to
each other's way.

05:31.167 --> 05:34.708
Yes, but it is the only way
for my government to decide

05:34.792 --> 05:39.458
whether or not to insist
that you be charged with murder.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.875
You find that Minbari witness
I mentioned in my report.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.333
He will back me up.
I am absolutely sure.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.042
Alright. Description?

05:53.458 --> 05:56.500
[sighs]
Bald with a bone on his head.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.708
We're gonna need
a real big line-up room.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.167
(male #1)
'Ambassador Mollari, please.'

06:04.250 --> 06:06.750
I'm sorry, the ambassador
is in meetings all day today.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.333
Is there something
I can help you with?

06:08.417 --> 06:11.042
Well, as a matter of fact,
there is.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.500
Please stand by
for a transmission.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.958
I believe you when you say
you weren't there.

06:21.042 --> 06:25.250
That is fortunate,
since Minbari do not lie.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.708
So if I ask you
if you might know

06:27.792 --> 06:29.958
who did see the incident
with Captain Sheridan

06:30.042 --> 06:31.458
you'd have to answer truthfully.

06:31.542 --> 06:33.417
Or not at all.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.917
Unless it is your intention
to beat it out of me.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.833
That is how your race operates,
is it not?

06:40.208 --> 06:42.250
I received your message.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.958
Is there a problem,
Mr. Garibaldi?

06:44.042 --> 06:46.208
- Yes.
- No.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.750
Mr. Garibaldi, not to intrude,
but if you are done

06:49.833 --> 06:53.083
I would like some time to speak
with him alone.

06:53.167 --> 06:55.042
Minbari-to-Minbari.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.875
As you say.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.167
(Garibaldi)
It's like he's everywhere.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.792
Every Minbari I question

07:08.875 --> 07:11.875
Lennier is either just leaving
or just arriving.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.625
Of course, maybe
he's simply being thorough.

07:13.708 --> 07:16.083
Or maybe he's organizing
a cover-up.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.500
Look, I have a suspicious mind

07:17.583 --> 07:19.250
but even I don't want
to think that.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.000
- I like the guy.
- Granted.

07:21.083 --> 07:24.500
But he's still Minbari with all
the baggage that brings.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.292
Have any luck
finding my stolen link?

07:27.375 --> 07:29.167
Uh, no trace.
It hasn't been used.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.875
The computer
would have picked it up at once.

07:30.958 --> 07:33.333
Chances are it's probably
been destroyed.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.250
Why would he want my link?

07:35.333 --> 07:37.917
It's useless once it's reported
stolen. It's hot.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.708
He must know
he'd have to get rid of it.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.125
Maybe it's because it's the one
thing he knew you'd want back.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.958
And maybe he wanted you to chase
him down the hall.

07:48.042 --> 07:52.083
You do have a suspicious mind.
I like that.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.792
Disruptive burns are consistent

07:53.875 --> 07:56.875
with, uh, close range
discharge of a PPG.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.833
Death was instantaneous.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.167
Hey, doc,
any sign of offensive wounds

08:02.250 --> 08:03.583
bruising around the knuckles
to show

08:03.667 --> 08:05.250
that he'd been
attackin' the captain?

08:05.333 --> 08:07.625
None, but he was wearing gloves
at the time

08:07.708 --> 08:09.667
and they would
diminish any trace.

08:09.750 --> 08:13.000
Also, he died seconds
after the attack

08:13.083 --> 08:14.542
so there wouldn't be enough time
for the cells

08:14.625 --> 08:16.083
to bruise in any event.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.917
Well, the good news is,
there's nothing in the autopsy

08:18.000 --> 08:20.542
that proves he was attacked
without cause.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.292
But the bad news..

08:22.375 --> 08:23.833
...is there's
nothing to corroborate

08:23.917 --> 08:25.375
your side of the story either.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.208
Great.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.458
Alright, so where'd
you get the PPG?

08:30.958 --> 08:32.917
I found it during the fight.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.833
I assumed it was dropped
by the guy who grabbed my link.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.417
Or maybe someone
wanted you to find it.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.250
I said the Minbari was going
for a weapon...or maybe

08:42.333 --> 08:44.083
he's the one who dropped it,
and that's the one I found.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.958
No, it doesn't track, why would
a member of the Minbari warrior

08:47.042 --> 08:48.958
caste be packin'
an Earth-made PPG?

08:49.042 --> 08:50.917
It'd be an affront
to his warrior pride.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.458
Any prosecution would blow a
hole in that one in two seconds.

08:54.542 --> 08:56.667
Alright,
you have any luck tracing

08:56.750 --> 08:58.792
the serial number on that PPG?

08:58.875 --> 09:02.250
No. Not yet. Still waiting to
hear back from Earth Central.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.417
You know, even in a vacuum,
this smells of a set-up.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.167
I don't like it.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.167
[intense music]

09:13.208 --> 09:15.542
[indistinct chattering]

09:30.458 --> 09:32.042
- Oh!
- Oh!

09:32.125 --> 09:34.958
I'm sorry. I just..
Ooh! I..

09:35.042 --> 09:36.250
Vir, are you alright?

09:36.333 --> 09:39.583
Oh, yes. Yes. No, I'm not.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.458
I can't stay.

09:41.542 --> 09:42.542
[laughs]

09:42.625 --> 09:46.125
I can't stay!
Now that's comedy!

09:48.167 --> 09:49.750
Bye-bye.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.000
You are certain
that this is the one

10:00.083 --> 10:01.667
who witnessed the attack,
Lennier?

10:01.750 --> 10:04.708
Reasonably so,
from things I've heard.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.583
Ashan..

10:10.667 --> 10:13.750
...you are of the Third Fane
of Chudomo, yes?

10:13.833 --> 10:15.333
I am.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.708
You carry with you a noble
and honorable tradition.

10:18.792 --> 10:22.000
Lennier is also of
the Third Fane of Chudomo.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.667
He has brought you great honor.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.417
So..

10:35.500 --> 10:38.208
...can you tell me what you know
of this incident?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.083
Ashan.

10:42.167 --> 10:46.000
I answer to other Minbari,
not freaks.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.708
[intense music]

10:59.333 --> 11:01.042
Your words insulted her.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.458
Her presence insulted me.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.875
Because we are the same,
you may ask your questions..

11:11.958 --> 11:14.458
...if you
can tolerate the answers.

11:18.042 --> 11:20.250
[dramatic music]

11:24.333 --> 11:27.667
The witness states that Lavell,
the victim

11:27.750 --> 11:31.292
was assaulted
by you without provocation.

11:31.375 --> 11:35.000
That he offered to surrender..

11:35.083 --> 11:36.250
...and that you shot him.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.583
He shouted, "Death first!"

11:38.667 --> 11:40.667
The witness stated
that what Lavell

11:40.750 --> 11:44.083
"Deh Fers't."

11:44.167 --> 11:46.917
Which, in our language,
roughly translates as

11:47.000 --> 11:48.375
"I yield to your authority."

11:48.458 --> 11:50.917
No. No way.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.958
I know what I heard,
and that isn't it.

11:53.042 --> 11:55.833
Now I want to talk
with your witness. He is lying.

11:55.917 --> 11:59.125
For your sake,
I did not hear that

11:59.208 --> 12:01.625
nor did you, Lennier.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.292
What are you talking about?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.542
Minbari do not lie, captain.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.667
It would be a stain
upon honor and soul.

12:08.750 --> 12:12.125
For someone of another species
to make such an accusation

12:12.208 --> 12:14.625
it would require
an immediate and fatal

12:14.708 --> 12:16.500
response from the accused.

12:18.542 --> 12:22.292
Then he is in error
where the truth is involved

12:22.375 --> 12:25.958
and I want
to speak with him now.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.958
Captain, I don't know
if that's smart.

12:38.042 --> 12:40.333
- They want you charged.
- I have to see him.

12:40.417 --> 12:45.375
Maybe I can reason with him, at
least find out why he's lying.

12:45.458 --> 12:48.333
[sighs]
What about Ivanova?
You want her there too?

12:48.417 --> 12:51.250
No, I don't want
this insanity disrupting

12:51.333 --> 12:53.292
the station any more
than it has to.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.875
We'll handle this.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.833
(male announcer)
'Welcome to Babylon 5 Emporium.'

13:05.917 --> 13:08.208
'Today we are offering
a 20% discount'

13:08.292 --> 13:10.958
'on all Narn figurines
and paraphernalia.'

13:11.042 --> 13:15.542
'Remember, Babylon 5 Emporium
is your place to shop.'

13:17.458 --> 13:19.208
Welcome.
Feel free to look around.

13:19.292 --> 13:21.625
We offer a 20% discount
to station personnel.

13:21.708 --> 13:23.167
Oh!

13:23.250 --> 13:25.083
Be still my heart.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.917
It all seems tasteful enough.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.542
Still it makes you wonder
if there's anything

13:34.625 --> 13:36.667
the Earth Senate
won't do to make money.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.167
I'm sorry, what?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.833
D-did you want to try this on?

13:42.375 --> 13:44.875
- This place is nuts.
- Excuse me.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.167
How much is this..

13:51.000 --> 13:52.833
...miss?

13:55.958 --> 13:58.833
Miss, do you gift-wrap?

14:00.833 --> 14:04.125
- Excuse me, officer.
- Allan, ma'am. Zack Allan.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.792
Take me to Captain Sheridan.

14:05.875 --> 14:09.208
- Are you expected?
- No. Dreaded.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.083
Why would I, out of the blue,
attack your man, Lavell?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.875
He was not a man, though,
was he?

14:18.958 --> 14:21.792
He was Minbari, Starkiller.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.000
We're not talking about history.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.792
We're discussing
the here and now.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.417
Wasn't it an earthman who said

14:28.500 --> 14:31.708
that those who do not listen
to history will repeat it?

14:32.875 --> 14:34.708
The Minbari listen..

14:36.125 --> 14:37.500
...very carefully.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.542
Ashan, is there the slightest
possibility

14:39.625 --> 14:41.292
that you misheard,
or did not see--

14:41.375 --> 14:42.792
Did not see?

14:42.875 --> 14:45.333
- It happened very quickly.
- Whose side are you on?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.250
We are on the side of the truth.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.500
- Is there another?
- Captain, this is--

14:50.583 --> 14:52.583
The one friend
you have in this room.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.833
Guinevere Corey, captain.
I'm your lawyer.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.792
What?

14:57.875 --> 15:00.375
May I ask what you were
discussing here?

15:02.250 --> 15:05.542
The only thing that matters,
the truth.

15:05.625 --> 15:09.792
Oh, yes, the favorite song
of the legally ignorant.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.708
Captain, are we finished here?

15:11.792 --> 15:13.375
Yes.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.375
Oh, we'll continue this later.

15:37.417 --> 15:40.500
This entire situation does not
look good for the captain.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.458
This situation cannot be,
Lennier.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.125
I've studied Sheridan
at great length.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.167
This is not in his character

15:47.250 --> 15:50.875
which makes
Ashan's statement...dubious.

15:52.333 --> 15:56.167
I don't appreciate being called
ignorant in front of others.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.167
I'm sorry.
Is naive better?

15:59.250 --> 16:02.417
And I don't need a lawyer.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
Now we're back to ignorant.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.125
May I?

16:06.208 --> 16:09.667
Captain, I didn't stop over here
for my health.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.542
I was en route to Earth
when I received a message

16:11.625 --> 16:12.875
to come here instead.

16:12.958 --> 16:14.542
Why?

16:14.625 --> 16:17.167
I've been authorized to give
you a heads-up on this, captain.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.792
Earth Dome has reviewed
the facts

16:18.875 --> 16:21.792
and they have decided to proceed
with an indictment against you.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.542
I don't believe it.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.250
That's what all my clients say.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.167
You'll believe it soon enough.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.958
Why would they go
along with this?

16:34.042 --> 16:35.542
Regardless of the facts
of the case

16:35.625 --> 16:37.667
obviously we are not going
to cop a guilty plea.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.125
We all know the mess
that would create.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.625
If we sweep it under the rug

16:40.708 --> 16:43.292
Earth is open to charges of
complicity and cover-up.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.917
They decided it would be
best to go to trial

16:45.000 --> 16:46.250
and let both sides be heard

16:46.333 --> 16:48.500
'show all the evidence,
and take the judgment.'

16:48.583 --> 16:50.792
Actually, I've reviewed
all of the facts

16:50.875 --> 16:52.708
of the case,
and, um, I don't think

16:52.792 --> 16:54.042
they have enough evidence
to convict

16:54.125 --> 16:55.833
beyond a reasonable doubt.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.750
You're holding something back.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.917
Alright.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.292
Straight up.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.250
Whether you're found guilty or
innocent, if this goes to trial

17:08.333 --> 17:10.083
you'll have to step down
as commanding officer

17:10.167 --> 17:12.917
of Babylon 5,
probably permanently.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.708
[instrumental music]

17:20.750 --> 17:23.625
(Sheridan)
'I keep running it through
my head, over and over.'

17:25.292 --> 17:27.583
It all happened so fast.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.833
[scoffs]

17:31.042 --> 17:33.500
What if I did do it?

17:33.583 --> 17:36.500
I did fire while he was
trying to surrender?

17:36.583 --> 17:38.250
Are you asking about
the possibility or whether

17:38.333 --> 17:40.625
I'll still respect you,
if that's what happened?

17:40.708 --> 17:42.958
The former. I don't think
I wanna know the latter.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.750
Then, I'll answer
that part first.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.792
Any danger of my losing
respect for you was eliminated

17:46.875 --> 17:49.083
when you asked that question.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.958
As to the former, I'll never
forget you once said to me

17:53.042 --> 17:54.542
"Never fear answers.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.833
Only fear running
out of questions."

17:58.042 --> 18:01.458
Ivanova, I never said that.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.542
- You didn't?
- No.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.792
Oh.

18:06.875 --> 18:09.167
Well, I'll let you know who did.

18:15.042 --> 18:16.458
Oh.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.625
[doorbell beeping]

18:18.708 --> 18:20.667
Yes, what is it, commander?

18:20.750 --> 18:22.083
What did you forget?

18:23.250 --> 18:26.250
Ah, Ambassador Kosh. I'm sorry.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.292
What can I do for you?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.000
The lesson.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.458
Uh, I know. I sort of forgot.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.667
Look, it's been
kind of a bad day

18:35.750 --> 18:38.333
and I'm not really
in the best frame of mind

18:38.417 --> 18:41.125
for any lessons just now.

18:41.208 --> 18:45.292
Precisely the correct time.
Come.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.583
No, y-you don't understand.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.958
I don't really
have time for this.

18:50.042 --> 18:51.583
Come.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.958
Oh.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.750
[sighs]

19:02.625 --> 19:05.375
- Chief, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.042
Listen, here's the file
on a Minbari named Ashan.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.333
This is the same guy that got
the captain in hot water?

19:11.417 --> 19:13.417
The same.
Listen, I want him followed.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.875
Don't do anything
to cause a problem

19:14.958 --> 19:16.042
and don't provoke him.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.708
Just, uh..

19:17.792 --> 19:19.250
...keep an eye on him.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.750
Will do.

19:23.292 --> 19:26.250
I'm not quite sure I understand
what we're doing down here.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.667
Good.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.667
What is this place?

19:30.750 --> 19:33.625
(Sheridan)
'It's pretty much
the worst part of down below.'

19:33.708 --> 19:35.750
If Garibaldi knew
we were down here alone

19:35.833 --> 19:37.625
he'd go right up the flue.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.208
There.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.708
What? You want me to go inside,
is that it?

20:01.875 --> 20:04.875
Why? What's inside there?

20:06.625 --> 20:09.917
One moment of perfect beauty.

20:16.167 --> 20:17.875
[scoffs]

21:10.708 --> 21:12.042
I was, uh..

21:12.125 --> 21:13.583
[clears throat]

21:15.583 --> 21:17.750
Well, I-I was sent.

21:22.917 --> 21:26.500
Ah, I'm sorry, I don't carry
any kind of hard currency.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.250
It's all done
with a credit chit

21:29.333 --> 21:32.042
for bookkeeping,
that sort of thing.

21:36.958 --> 21:38.250
[sighs]

21:38.333 --> 21:40.625
Uh..

21:40.708 --> 21:43.083
...I really don't
have anything to give you.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.542
Um..

21:45.625 --> 21:48.125
[exhales]

21:50.167 --> 21:51.833
Look, um..

21:53.583 --> 21:55.625
...it's a stat bar.

21:55.708 --> 21:59.000
Uh, I-I've got about
a dozen of them.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.875
They show what part
of the service you're in.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.167
Gold for command.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.792
Red for medical,
green for security.

22:09.875 --> 22:12.708
Well, it's not worth very much.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.792
[choral singing]

23:08.583 --> 23:10.875
[singing continues]

23:16.875 --> 23:19.458
[indistinct chatter]

23:22.583 --> 23:25.167
Well, well..

23:25.250 --> 23:28.625
How many drinks does
that make for you now, hmm?

23:28.708 --> 23:29.833
Two.

23:29.917 --> 23:33.292
Vir, drowning your problems.

23:33.375 --> 23:36.292
Two? In all this time?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.375
I like nursing my drinks.

23:40.417 --> 23:43.458
Vir, this isn't you.

23:43.542 --> 23:46.625
You're gonna lecture me on what
is or isn't like someone?

23:46.708 --> 23:47.917
Everything you've done?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.917
Your voice, Vir.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.333
We're in public.

23:51.417 --> 23:54.625
Yes, voices.
The voices that keep me awake.

23:54.708 --> 23:57.042
The voices I have to keep
bottled up inside me

23:57.125 --> 23:58.542
so I can do my job?

23:58.625 --> 24:01.333
And you're doing it,
excellently.

24:01.417 --> 24:04.000
Yes, I'm keeping your secrets.

24:04.083 --> 24:05.750
Londo, I feel like
I'm falling in a pit

24:05.833 --> 24:07.375
and there's no way
of climbing out.

24:07.458 --> 24:10.125
Do you want to leave?
Is that it?

24:10.208 --> 24:11.875
I can arrange it.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.875
You can go back home to, uh--

24:13.958 --> 24:16.708
To what? To my family?

24:16.792 --> 24:18.875
Do you think that
if they wanted me around

24:18.958 --> 24:21.125
that I'd even be here?

24:21.208 --> 24:24.083
They just wanted me anywhere.

24:24.167 --> 24:25.708
Anywhere away.

24:27.375 --> 24:31.292
They had me sent here two years
ago because frankly

24:31.375 --> 24:33.792
there wasn't much competition
for the job.

24:33.875 --> 24:36.625
This was a joke to them.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.875
Before I left,
my uncle said to me

24:38.958 --> 24:41.458
you and I deserve each other.

24:41.542 --> 24:43.792
Well, Vir, you must know
that is changing.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.708
Oh. Don't I know that.

24:50.542 --> 24:52.708
This came this morning.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.625
Centauri Prime is sending
a replacement for my position.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.708
It seems the job has become
too important.

24:59.792 --> 25:03.000
They're sending in someone that
they've groomed for the role.

25:05.333 --> 25:11.250
Everywhere I go, I don't fit in,
or I'm asked to leave.

25:11.333 --> 25:14.250
Alright, I'll talk to them.

25:14.333 --> 25:17.417
They can't make you leave
if I wish you to stay.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.417
What you wish. What they wish.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.583
I don't even know what I wish.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.583
I mean, back home,
I'm swallowed in silence

25:25.667 --> 25:27.583
and here I'm swallowed up
by secrets.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.875
I'm caught
between fire and flood

25:29.958 --> 25:32.875
and if there's a way out,
I sure don't see it.

25:35.042 --> 25:36.708
I'm sorry.

25:38.333 --> 25:42.417
[sighs]
I've said too much.
It's more than you want to hear.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.250
- No.
- This is my problem.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.333
It's my problem.

25:46.417 --> 25:48.833
It's not yours.

25:48.917 --> 25:50.875
And I'm sorry. I-I, I..

25:50.958 --> 25:52.792
I just..

25:56.583 --> 25:58.625
I'm sorry.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.125
Vir..

26:01.875 --> 26:03.125
Vir..

26:03.208 --> 26:05.750
[laughing]

26:26.750 --> 26:30.042
I had no idea, no idea at all.

26:31.667 --> 26:34.125
- Yes.
- Thank you.

26:44.542 --> 26:46.208
- Another lesson?
- Yeah.

26:46.292 --> 26:48.042
What this time?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.833
Beauty..

26:51.917 --> 26:53.625
...in the dark.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.750
Oh, must be working.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.125
You're beginning to talk
just like a Vorlon.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.542
Yes, Delenn?

27:09.625 --> 27:12.375
I have just received
some information on Lavell.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.208
I was arranging
to have his body prepared

27:14.292 --> 27:16.417
according to the ceremonies
and rituals of whichever

27:16.500 --> 27:18.708
clan he belonged to, and..

27:18.792 --> 27:20.917
You may want to look at this.

27:28.833 --> 27:31.167
And even though we set up that
meeting with Non-Aligned Worlds

27:31.250 --> 27:33.542
weeks ago, they've canceled
without explanation.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.625
Word's gotten out, hasn't it?

27:35.708 --> 27:37.333
Pressure to get me out is just
going to increase

27:37.417 --> 27:39.000
the longer
this hangs over my head.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.167
Well, one crisis at a time.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.542
Captain! Commander!

27:46.125 --> 27:47.792
Can we talk?

28:11.250 --> 28:12.958
[groans]

28:16.917 --> 28:19.333
[dramatic music]

28:27.625 --> 28:29.167
[gasps]

28:30.000 --> 28:31.750
I have acted shamefully

28:31.833 --> 28:36.000
to buy you the time to end this
matter in some honorable way.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.875
Only because we are both of
Chudomo, do I take this step

28:38.958 --> 28:41.292
to try and convince you
to act properly.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.125
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:43.208 --> 28:46.708
I saw you with the human thief
the captain is looking for.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.167
Another moment,
and you would have been

28:48.250 --> 28:50.125
discovered by station security.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.833
'You're not good at this,
Ashan.'

28:51.917 --> 28:55.333
You can redeem yourself
by telling the truth now

28:55.417 --> 28:57.958
or shame our entire clan
when the truth is discovered.

28:58.042 --> 29:01.167
You would believe the humans
over one of your own?

29:01.250 --> 29:02.542
- Yes.
- 'Why?'

29:02.625 --> 29:05.708
- Because she does.
- Delenn? She is nothing!

29:05.792 --> 29:09.708
Delenn is honorable,
and I honor the word of Delenn.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.250
What do you honor, Ashan?

29:11.333 --> 29:14.417
The truth or the obligations
of our clan?

29:24.417 --> 29:25.750
(Londo)
'And the Centauri government'

29:25.833 --> 29:29.042
'will not tolerate
such insults!'

29:29.125 --> 29:31.833
Well, it's just a doll.
It wasn't even made by us.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.167
Look at the tag,
it's probably been made

29:33.250 --> 29:34.333
by somebody down in the bazaar.

29:34.417 --> 29:35.958
It's a mockery.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.667
It doesn't
even have any, uh...attributes.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.083
Attributes?

29:44.750 --> 29:47.458
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

29:49.583 --> 29:51.000
(both)
Oh!

29:51.083 --> 29:52.500
I see, so you feel
like you're being

29:52.583 --> 29:55.583
symbolically cast...in a bad
light.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.583
- Well put.
- Now look here.

29:57.667 --> 29:59.250
If I have to go back to my--

29:59.333 --> 30:02.750
Ivanova, have all of these
dolls removed at once, please.

30:02.833 --> 30:04.083
Yes, sir.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.208
Thank you for the sensitivity,
captain.

30:06.292 --> 30:07.875
I do not lie when I say
this could have been

30:07.958 --> 30:10.125
a major embarrassment
for all concerned.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.708
Oh, I'm sure, ambassador.

30:11.792 --> 30:14.042
You don't lie. The Minbari
don't lie. No one around here--

30:14.125 --> 30:16.250
Who said the Minbari don't lie?

30:17.708 --> 30:20.333
Oh, never mind.
Good day, captain.

30:20.417 --> 30:21.792
Are you saying they do lie?

30:21.875 --> 30:23.375
No, it was nothing important.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.208
Londo, I have a critical
situation

30:25.292 --> 30:27.958
hinging on Minbari honesty.

30:28.042 --> 30:30.708
Now, if you know something..

30:30.792 --> 30:33.917
[sighs]
A certain Minbari once lied

30:34.000 --> 30:37.500
to save a certain
Centauri ambassador

30:37.583 --> 30:39.500
from embarrassment.

30:39.583 --> 30:43.583
Apparently there is honor
in helping another save face.

30:45.417 --> 30:48.042
If they'd lie to protect
someone's honor..

30:49.542 --> 30:55.042
...the question becomes
who or what is being protected?

30:56.542 --> 30:58.083
Good day, captain.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.750
[beeping]

31:00.833 --> 31:02.083
- Yeah.
- 'Captain.'

31:02.167 --> 31:04.417
'We've got a rep
from the Minbari Embassy'

31:04.500 --> 31:06.250
'on Earth
asking to speak to you.'

31:06.333 --> 31:08.333
'Shall I put it through?'

31:08.417 --> 31:10.250
By all means.

31:10.333 --> 31:14.167
[instrumental music]

31:36.875 --> 31:38.708
I just got a call.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.292
Your government
wants Ashan to leave

31:42.375 --> 31:44.750
for your Homeworld
on the next shuttle.

31:46.542 --> 31:48.583
'With the primary
witness against me'

31:48.667 --> 31:50.292
'gone by your
government's request'

31:50.375 --> 31:53.000
there can't be a trial.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.208
Which will relieve Earth no end.

31:56.583 --> 32:01.042
Without a trial, without some
definitive answers..

32:02.583 --> 32:05.042
...it will leave doubt
in the minds of everyone here

32:05.125 --> 32:07.000
'about what really happened.'

32:07.083 --> 32:10.167
It will more or less
destroy my credibility

32:10.250 --> 32:13.875
which is maybe what some people
wanted from the start.

32:18.417 --> 32:22.500
Once, during the war,
my fighter was disabled.

32:22.583 --> 32:25.500
I sat there,
radio out, power out

32:25.583 --> 32:29.625
for eight hours,
which seemed like eight years.

32:29.708 --> 32:32.500
I didn't think I'd ever see
another living being.

32:33.583 --> 32:36.292
Well, I was
rescued obviously, but..

32:36.375 --> 32:40.750
...I'll never forget that
feeling of helplessness.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.625
I-I never thought
there could be anything

32:44.708 --> 32:47.708
worse than being
all alone in the night.

32:47.792 --> 32:53.208
But there is.
Being all alone in a crowd.

32:53.292 --> 32:57.583
You feel cut off from your
people, from your government.

32:57.667 --> 32:59.792
You even begin to doubt
yourself.

33:01.458 --> 33:05.542
I understand it so well
that it cuts to my heart.

33:07.167 --> 33:10.250
You said the Minbari never lie.

33:10.333 --> 33:13.167
But that's not entirely true,
is it?

33:13.250 --> 33:16.708
You must understand, captain
that there is no greater honor

33:16.792 --> 33:19.542
among my people than to serve.

33:19.625 --> 33:24.042
They work for generations
to create a legacy, a tradition.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.583
In the service of their clan

33:26.667 --> 33:29.458
they're ready to sacrifice
everything.

33:29.542 --> 33:33.167
Their individuality,
their blood, their life.

33:33.250 --> 33:37.417
Their honor? Well, we've had
plenty of that ourselves.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.042
Conspiracies of silence
because the larger ideals

33:40.125 --> 33:42.250
have to be protected.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.125
But you can't have larger ideals

33:44.208 --> 33:47.000
if the smaller ones
get compromised.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.083
It's like building a house
without a foundation, Delenn.

33:49.167 --> 33:51.417
It can't stand!

33:51.500 --> 33:53.667
You know that as well as I do.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.875
Come with me.

34:15.042 --> 34:17.875
I was to report here
for parting instructions.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.000
Yes.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.542
Your ship leaves
within the hour.

34:23.625 --> 34:26.208
Here's all the information
you will need upon arrival.

34:26.292 --> 34:27.917
Thank you.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.292
Is there anything else?

34:32.708 --> 34:33.958
No.

34:34.042 --> 34:36.625
After you have gone,
I will go to the captain

34:36.708 --> 34:39.208
and announce my complicity
in the death of Lavell.

34:39.292 --> 34:41.000
What?

34:41.083 --> 34:43.125
You're insane.
You had nothing to do with it.

34:43.208 --> 34:46.750
That is correct.
Individually, I did not.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.125
But I bear the responsibility
for all acts

34:49.208 --> 34:50.708
committed by my clan.

34:50.792 --> 34:53.875
In that way,
I am as responsible as you are.

34:53.958 --> 34:57.417
If you do that,
you will dishonor yourself

34:57.500 --> 34:59.542
and the Third Fane of Chudomo.

34:59.625 --> 35:02.458
No, you have already done that.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.792
I will retain honor
by saving face for you.

35:05.875 --> 35:10.375
Our clan, however, will never
recover from this disgrace.

35:10.458 --> 35:11.875
- Then don't do it.
- Don't do it.

35:11.958 --> 35:15.000
Listen to me, Lennier.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.833
We are not responsible.

35:16.917 --> 35:19.042
It was the leaders of our clan
who decided to act

35:19.125 --> 35:22.000
without asking the council or
anyone else in the government

35:22.083 --> 35:23.333
not us.

35:23.417 --> 35:26.000
- Yes, it was foolish.
- No, not foolish.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.792
It was tragic.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.833
They resent
that the humans picked

35:29.917 --> 35:32.125
Sheridan Starkiller
to run this place

35:32.208 --> 35:33.917
and rightly so.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.500
When he destroyed
the Black Star during the war

35:37.583 --> 35:40.042
he did not face it with honor.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.875
He mined an asteroid field

35:41.958 --> 35:45.667
sent a fake distress signal,
and lured our ships into a trap.

35:47.625 --> 35:50.458
Many of our clan were aboard
the Black Star that day.

35:50.542 --> 35:52.417
I know.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.417
I lost family as well
on the Black Star

35:55.500 --> 35:57.667
But tell me, Ashan, is there
any more honor in this?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.292
I don't know.

36:01.125 --> 36:02.833
I didn't know.

36:02.917 --> 36:04.250
Why were you talking
with the human

36:04.333 --> 36:05.667
who stole Sheridan's link?

36:05.750 --> 36:07.958
I was trying to find out
what happened.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.083
Lavell paid him
to draw Sheridan down that hall

36:12.167 --> 36:13.583
provoked him, and made sure
a weapon was there

36:13.667 --> 36:15.958
to be used against him.

36:16.042 --> 36:17.292
Lavell is a martyr.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.792
He sacrificed himself
to remove Sheridan.

36:21.458 --> 36:24.750
He was one of us,
a clan brother.

36:24.833 --> 36:28.833
We have to protect our own,
Lennier, or what is left?

36:28.917 --> 36:31.083
There is nothing left, Ashan.

36:31.167 --> 36:33.167
Lavell threw away
his life for nothing

36:33.250 --> 36:35.042
and dishonored
our entire people.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.458
What is this? How did you--

36:37.542 --> 36:40.708
When Delenn received
Lavell's burial instructions

36:40.792 --> 36:44.708
she learned that you and he
were both of the same clan.

36:44.792 --> 36:46.458
'Now, saving the honor
of your clan'

36:46.542 --> 36:48.917
'is the one thing that
could compel you to lie'

36:49.000 --> 36:53.125
but we knew we couldn't
prove it...without help.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.333
You recorded it all.

37:00.417 --> 37:02.958
You betcha. Let's go.

37:03.042 --> 37:04.750
Zack, I want him in lock-up

37:04.833 --> 37:06.375
until we decide
what to do with him.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.167
Check.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.792
Question, ambassador.

37:09.875 --> 37:13.167
Will the Minbari
government contest this?

37:13.250 --> 37:16.958
No. Whatever factions
may have sponsored this charade

37:17.042 --> 37:18.792
will not pursue
the matter interface

37:18.875 --> 37:20.125
of the public confession.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.625
The question is,
do we want a public confession?

37:23.708 --> 37:26.625
Captain, what are you
talking about?

37:26.708 --> 37:27.958
Look what we just went through
to get all this

37:28.042 --> 37:29.542
and now you're not gonna use it?

37:29.625 --> 37:33.042
I agree. As your attorney, I
think this is very ill-advised.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.000
So noted.

37:37.542 --> 37:40.667
Lennier, if we reveal this..

37:41.917 --> 37:44.833
...it will disgrace your clan,
won't it?

37:44.917 --> 37:46.792
And you.

37:52.875 --> 37:55.625
Ambassador, I'm willing
to cut a deal with you.

37:56.917 --> 38:00.125
I'll turn over
all this material..

38:00.208 --> 38:02.167
...if you'll get Ashan
to issue a statement

38:02.250 --> 38:05.750
about what he really saw.
None of the background.

38:05.833 --> 38:08.708
Leave his clan out of it.

38:08.792 --> 38:12.583
We'll leave Lavell's motives
in the attack, one more mystery.

38:14.208 --> 38:19.208
And around here,
who'll notice one more, hmm?

38:22.958 --> 38:25.500
[instrumental music]

38:32.000 --> 38:34.042
Feeling better, are we?

38:34.125 --> 38:35.625
I don't know.

38:35.708 --> 38:39.417
I can't seem
to count past...14.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.542
Your first hangover.
Enjoy it.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.083
I remember my first hangover.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.625
Well, actually that's not true.

38:45.708 --> 38:49.208
If I remembered it,
it wouldn't be a real hangover.

38:49.292 --> 38:51.375
May I ask you a question?

38:51.458 --> 38:55.375
Anything, anything.
Just don't do that again.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.417
How quickly can you pack?

38:59.167 --> 39:02.083
Your replacement arrived
a few hours ago.

39:02.167 --> 39:04.375
Just in time, I might add.

39:06.167 --> 39:07.792
I see.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.500
Where are you going?

39:13.583 --> 39:15.167
To my quarters to pack.

39:15.250 --> 39:18.417
Why is it that you can never
follow instructions?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.667
Start with this stuff first.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.167
This is yours.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.917
Good, Vir, you're sobering up.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.750
I can see the synapses beginning
to fire behind your eyes.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.208
'A frightening sight,
I might add.'

39:31.292 --> 39:35.083
I informed Homeworld
that if you were leaving

39:35.167 --> 39:37.000
then I was leaving with you.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.083
- What?
- Yes.

39:40.167 --> 39:43.542
I gave them an extensive report
of your work here to date.

39:43.625 --> 39:47.792
I told them that you were
absolutely invaluable to me.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.500
'That in all
my years of service'

39:49.583 --> 39:53.333
'I have never had a more skilled
or capable assistant.'

39:53.417 --> 39:56.833
I'm told your family
was quite astonished.

39:56.917 --> 39:59.292
I spoke to your uncle,
personally.

39:59.375 --> 40:02.708
- You spoke to...to my uncle?
- Yes, Vir.

40:02.792 --> 40:04.708
By the time
I finished with him

40:04.792 --> 40:06.833
he was ready
to nominate you for godhood.

40:06.917 --> 40:08.542
I was quite magnificent,
actually.

40:08.625 --> 40:09.792
You should have seen it.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.625
Would have, had you been
conscious at the time.

40:12.708 --> 40:15.708
I imagine they'll be talking
about it for some time.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.125
[chuckles]

40:18.333 --> 40:20.292
Vir..

40:20.375 --> 40:24.417
...I have perhaps not treated
you as well as I should have.

40:24.500 --> 40:30.250
I cannot change the past,
but the present, yes.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.667
Vir, stay.

40:32.750 --> 40:38.000
If you go, as a matter of honor,
I will have to go with you.

40:38.083 --> 40:41.292
And if I am forced
to leave this place

40:41.375 --> 40:44.667
with all its marvelous
opportunities..

40:44.750 --> 40:47.833
...I will have to kill you.

40:47.917 --> 40:49.958
What are friends for?

40:53.417 --> 40:54.958
Londo..

40:56.500 --> 40:58.292
...thank you.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.292
You're welcome.

41:00.375 --> 41:05.125
Oh, by the way, when I was
speaking with your uncle

41:05.208 --> 41:08.958
I invited your entire family
to come and stay with you

41:09.042 --> 41:12.208
for a month.
I knew you wouldn't mind.

41:12.292 --> 41:14.417
I do. Londo. No! L..

41:23.833 --> 41:25.750
[panting]

41:27.333 --> 41:29.750
A whole month.

41:29.833 --> 41:33.750
Uh, commander,
how goes the Babylon 5 store?

41:33.833 --> 41:35.708
- Most interesting.
- Aha!

41:35.792 --> 41:38.292
You know, I was thinking
this might work out after all.

41:38.375 --> 41:41.375
We could use the extra money
to defray operating expenses.

41:43.958 --> 41:46.708
- What is that?
- Hmm. Take a look.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.250
[chuckles]

41:49.333 --> 41:51.000
"Bab-Bearlon 5."

41:52.333 --> 41:55.083
- Oh, he's a cutie, isn't he?
- Oh, yeah.

41:58.417 --> 42:00.792
"J.S.?"

42:00.875 --> 42:03.208
John Sheridan.

42:03.292 --> 42:04.917
Jo.. Oh.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.833
- This is supposed to be me?
- Yeah.

42:07.917 --> 42:09.292
Ah!

42:10.958 --> 42:14.083
I want it off my station.
I want them all off my station.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.333
I want the whole
store yanked out, boxed up

42:16.417 --> 42:18.458
and shipped out
by 0800 tomorrow.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.750
- Is that clear?
- I'll get right on it.

42:20.833 --> 42:22.333
Um..

42:30.167 --> 42:31.917
[dramatic music]

42:35.708 --> 42:37.333
(female #1)
'Babylon Control to Zeta One.'

42:37.417 --> 42:39.375
'Any trace of
that unidentified object?'

42:39.458 --> 42:41.917
Negative, Babylon Control.
I don't see a..

42:47.750 --> 42:50.958
'Zeta One, have you encountered
unidentified object?'

42:51.042 --> 42:53.625
- 'Can you describe it?'
- Negative, Babylon Control.

42:53.708 --> 42:58.208
I don't think so. Not on a bet.
Heading back to the barn.

43:11.625 --> 43:14.042
[theme music]
