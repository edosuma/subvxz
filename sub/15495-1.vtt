02:54.161 --> 02:57.533
Hey, look! It's the President!

02:58.501 --> 03:00.967
And the Pope!

03:15.035 --> 03:19.346
Oh, my God! Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.

03:37.335 --> 03:40.618
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!

03:47.625 --> 03:50.336
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.

03:50.544 --> 03:52.838
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.

03:53.047 --> 03:56.300
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.845
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.

04:00.012 --> 04:04.350
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.

07:24.383 --> 07:28.053
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?

07:28.262 --> 07:33.434
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.

07:33.601 --> 07:36.103
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.

07:36.270 --> 07:40.024
Milky, creamy skin,
pouting red lips, firm buttocks,

07:40.191 --> 07:43.194
ample breasts, ears you'd love
to stick your tongue into...

07:43.360 --> 07:47.073
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.617
There's somebody here to see you.

07:54.622 --> 07:56.207
Pahpshmir!

07:57.291 --> 08:03.756
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.

08:03.964 --> 08:06.926
You're supposed to be
the world's best terrorist bomber.

08:07.093 --> 08:11.472
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.

08:11.639 --> 08:15.434
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.

08:15.643 --> 08:20.648
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.

08:20.815 --> 08:24.777
I told you. A first-class job
would cost five million.

08:24.985 --> 08:27.321
If you want to step up the price,

08:27.488 --> 08:32.284
I got a target that'll make City Hall
look like chicken feed.

08:34.662 --> 08:39.166
A big target.
Why should anything be different?

08:39.332 --> 08:41.460
Because five million dollars buys me!

08:42.753 --> 08:44.547
I'm breaking out of here.

08:44.713 --> 08:50.177
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon,
my people won't be so forgiving.

08:51.011 --> 08:54.306
Fail? Show me one man
who can stop me.

09:30.384 --> 09:35.765
<i>Attention shoppers, be sure to check
out our special on paper towels.</i>

09:38.434 --> 09:40.186
<i>That's aisle seven.</i>

09:45.483 --> 09:46.483
Hey!

09:48.611 --> 09:52.406
- Give it to me!
- My purse! Somebody help me!

09:52.573 --> 09:55.367
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!

09:57.078 --> 10:02.291
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow...

10:03.334 --> 10:06.670
...which nobody can deny.

10:09.799 --> 10:15.137
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.

10:15.304 --> 10:21.560
Today I retire. If I do any shooting now,
it'll have to be in my own home.

10:21.727 --> 10:27.233
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not
an in-law like at my bachelor party.

10:27.441 --> 10:31.237
Ed, I officially give you my gun...

10:33.364 --> 10:36.564
...and my badge.

10:39.328 --> 10:45.751
And... Jane and I would like
to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.

10:48.838 --> 10:55.052
Cheer up, Ed. This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".

10:58.889 --> 11:02.435
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!

11:02.643 --> 11:06.689
- Lt. Drebin! Frank! Didn't you see that?
- What? Oh...

11:06.856 --> 11:10.317
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar. Great!

11:10.484 --> 11:15.072
<i>Order. The jury will disregard that
last statement. Continue, counselor.</i>

11:16.657 --> 11:20.786
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...

11:20.953 --> 11:26.041
You haven't paid alimony in two years,
repeatedly defying a court order.

11:26.208 --> 11:30.421
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address. She moved twice.

11:30.588 --> 11:33.507
Don't lie to me. You're under oath.

11:33.674 --> 11:37.344
Do you know
what the penalty for perjury is?

11:37.511 --> 11:40.639
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!

11:40.806 --> 11:44.477
Your Honor, I... Ow, ow, gee.

11:44.643 --> 11:48.022
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!

11:49.899 --> 11:52.902
Mommy said no pounding
when she's in session.

11:53.069 --> 11:55.571
Read the prosecution's last statement.

11:55.738 --> 12:00.326
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.

12:00.534 --> 12:03.621
"Do you know
what the penalty for perjury is?"

12:05.915 --> 12:07.750
That's all I have, Your Honor.

12:07.917 --> 12:11.378
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.

12:11.545 --> 12:13.839
Prosecution rests.

12:14.048 --> 12:16.967
Defense Attorney
Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.

12:17.134 --> 12:18.969
No further questions.

12:19.136 --> 12:24.225
Court will recess
until after the morning feeding.

12:26.727 --> 12:30.856
- We can win this. I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.

12:31.065 --> 12:35.986
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.

12:36.153 --> 12:38.906
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.

12:39.740 --> 12:43.452
Louise, there's no such thing
as the wrong man.

12:43.619 --> 12:46.330
You just have to work at it.

12:46.497 --> 12:49.834
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?

12:50.459 --> 12:55.881
Now, you two have been married
for six months?

12:56.048 --> 12:59.343
Yes. We really appreciate
you seeing us, Doctor.

12:59.510 --> 13:01.846
Our last therapist recommended you.

13:02.471 --> 13:05.599
Yes, I was sorry
to hear about his suicide.

13:05.766 --> 13:11.564
A couple need to get off on the right foot
and not get caught up in blame.

13:11.731 --> 13:15.735
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.

13:15.901 --> 13:17.278
Yes, of course.

13:17.445 --> 13:20.948
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.

13:21.115 --> 13:24.910
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.

13:25.077 --> 13:28.080
He has no idea
what a woman wants or needs.

13:28.247 --> 13:31.917
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?

13:32.126 --> 13:37.047
I want to have a baby. Every time
we make love, you have a headache.

13:37.214 --> 13:40.050
I'm not a piece of meat. I'm trying!

13:40.217 --> 13:44.597
I've got ointments, lotions, creams,
books, things that vibrate...

13:44.764 --> 13:46.974
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.

13:47.141 --> 13:52.229
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear? A black teddy?

13:52.396 --> 13:56.317
- I've tried them all. They don't work.
- Oh!

13:56.484 --> 13:58.402
Why don't you want a child?

13:58.569 --> 14:02.865
Didn't I try to adopt
that 18-year old Korean girl?

14:03.032 --> 14:07.453
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.

14:07.620 --> 14:13.501
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.

14:13.667 --> 14:18.297
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis
station. Just be Jane and Frank.

14:18.464 --> 14:19.864
Lovers!

14:20.674 --> 14:24.804
We haven't had a night like that
in a long time.

14:25.012 --> 14:28.057
- Not together.
- Frank!

14:29.225 --> 14:32.812
Jane, having a baby
is a big responsibility.

14:33.020 --> 14:35.981
Like being in charge of sanitation
at a Haitian jail.

14:36.148 --> 14:38.192
I'm just frightened.

14:38.359 --> 14:41.487
Let's make tonight something special.

14:41.695 --> 14:44.615
Oh, honey, it's just
that I love you so much.

14:44.782 --> 14:47.410
My little lover sparrow.

14:47.576 --> 14:50.287
My puppy wuppy wuvver.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.873
My little love biscuit.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.294
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.

14:58.337 --> 15:02.508
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm
a diabetic. I think you ought to go now.

15:04.885 --> 15:09.807
<i>- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?</i>

15:11.058 --> 15:15.479
<i>I don't know. Some other way.</i>

15:16.230 --> 15:18.983
<i>Oh, Jason, please...</i>

15:19.150 --> 15:22.150
<i>Bobbi...</i>

15:22.611 --> 15:27.700
<i>- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.</i>

15:30.494 --> 15:33.414
Ed, Nordberg! It's been a long time!

15:33.581 --> 15:36.542
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.

15:36.709 --> 15:40.629
I'm taking a step class,
and I got a thigh master for Christmas.

15:40.796 --> 15:43.257
Where are my manners? Come on in!

15:44.467 --> 15:48.012
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.

15:48.179 --> 15:53.392
Excuse the mess. It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.

15:53.559 --> 15:56.187
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.

15:56.353 --> 15:59.231
We're having trouble
with a terrorist threat.

15:59.398 --> 16:02.193
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.

16:02.359 --> 16:05.279
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.

16:05.446 --> 16:10.534
We're here because we need
your help with something.

16:17.666 --> 16:20.169
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.

16:20.336 --> 16:23.547
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.

16:23.714 --> 16:28.844
We may have a lead on a suspect
in the City Hall bombing attempt.

16:29.011 --> 16:31.222
These were taken by a photographer.

16:31.388 --> 16:34.433
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.

16:34.600 --> 16:39.271
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin. She's a nurse.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.273
Can I keep this one?

16:41.440 --> 16:47.279
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on
Myrtlewood. Her name is Tanya Peters.

16:47.446 --> 16:51.992
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?

16:52.159 --> 16:54.370
The big disco shoot out.

17:12.012 --> 17:14.890
Hey, Ed. What's happening, my man?

17:15.057 --> 17:18.352
We missed you last night
at the fondue party.

17:18.519 --> 17:22.481
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People. They're gas.

17:22.647 --> 17:24.983
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?

17:25.151 --> 17:27.819
One dead disco dancer.

17:28.028 --> 17:32.241
- Bummer! What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.

17:32.408 --> 17:35.828
This is the suspect's girlfriend,
Tanya Peters.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.039
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.086
We'll need a statement from you
down at the station.

17:44.253 --> 17:48.340
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!

17:57.266 --> 18:02.229
I do remember! You were one
of the first test cases for minoxidol.

18:02.396 --> 18:05.483
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.778
If you don't mind,
I've got a rump of lamb to roast.

18:08.944 --> 18:12.448
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.

18:12.615 --> 18:16.827
It's not that. We need you
to go undercover at the clinic.

18:16.994 --> 18:21.540
I've quit police work. You're whistling
up the wrong neck of the woods.

18:21.749 --> 18:24.043
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.

18:24.210 --> 18:30.091
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.

18:30.257 --> 18:33.761
I can't. Jane and I have
a special evening planned.

18:33.928 --> 18:37.306
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.

18:37.473 --> 18:40.226
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.

18:40.434 --> 18:45.731
Think of all the crime. Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.

18:45.898 --> 18:48.567
You'd be protecting
all the Janes of the world.

18:48.776 --> 18:52.655
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.

18:52.822 --> 18:55.157
Funny how you miss the little things.

18:55.324 --> 18:59.286
Might be good to feel cold steel
against my thigh again.

18:59.453 --> 19:01.914
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!

19:03.541 --> 19:06.168
<i>After folding the laundry,
I set out for the clinic.</i>

19:06.335 --> 19:09.839
<i>Police operations require
a foolproof disguise.</i>

19:10.005 --> 19:13.259
<i>This operation was no different.</i>

19:14.969 --> 19:19.598
<i>I had no idea if Tanya would
recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.</i>

19:19.807 --> 19:22.435
<i>I combed my hair differently,
just in case.</i>

19:22.601 --> 19:27.273
<i>I planned to get in and find out about
Tanya's connection with the bombing,</i>

19:27.440 --> 19:29.775
<i>and get out as quickly as possible.</i>

19:29.942 --> 19:35.156
<i>I figured faking an old football injury
would do the trick.</i>

19:35.322 --> 19:38.284
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.

19:39.285 --> 19:43.622
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr?

19:43.789 --> 19:46.125
Smith. No, I don't.

19:46.292 --> 19:49.295
- Then take a number.
- Six.

19:49.503 --> 19:52.298
- What?
- Is six taken?

19:52.465 --> 19:55.926
Does it have to be
between one and ten?

19:58.471 --> 20:02.308
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.

20:08.606 --> 20:10.606
Mr. Smith?

20:11.567 --> 20:15.154
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now. Dr. Kohlzak?

20:15.321 --> 20:18.616
Good morning, Mr. Smith. Right this way.

20:18.783 --> 20:24.413
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.

20:30.127 --> 20:35.633
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.846
- In the back yard? With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits...

20:41.013 --> 20:45.476
...we like to go out in the back yard
and throw it around.

20:45.643 --> 20:48.354
What did you and your uncle find out?

20:48.562 --> 20:52.525
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.

20:52.733 --> 20:58.697
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling. It's kind of numb.

20:58.906 --> 21:01.534
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.

21:05.413 --> 21:09.125
- If you would...
- For what?

21:09.291 --> 21:12.211
- A sperm count.
- In here?

21:12.378 --> 21:16.006
It's not exactly the back yard,
but it will do.

21:16.715 --> 21:18.115
Well...

21:35.067 --> 21:39.572
Follow me, and we'll do
the necessary paperwork.

21:41.949 --> 21:46.662
Sign these at the bottom,
and leave them with the nurse.

21:47.913 --> 21:49.915
- This way, please.
- What?

21:50.124 --> 21:52.585
- Number 17.
- A problem?

21:52.752 --> 21:56.297
- No.
- This is 17. You're next.

21:56.464 --> 22:00.760
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.

22:06.265 --> 22:07.465
Sir...

22:08.392 --> 22:11.604
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?

22:12.563 --> 22:14.607
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.

22:14.815 --> 22:17.735
Would you like a video tape
to assist you?

22:17.902 --> 22:21.989
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?

22:22.156 --> 22:25.156
An adult movie.

22:36.504 --> 22:38.714
The tape was very entertaining.

22:38.881 --> 22:40.881
Follow me.

22:41.801 --> 22:44.637
Do you have "Spartacus"?

23:05.866 --> 23:10.621
<i>Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.</i>

23:10.788 --> 23:13.188
<i>Stat.</i>

23:17.628 --> 23:20.423
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.

23:20.589 --> 23:25.136
You should always look your best,
even by yourself.

23:25.302 --> 23:27.638
Are you sure we've never met?

23:27.805 --> 23:30.975
Oh, here's my cup. Back to work.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.938
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?

23:36.105 --> 23:38.524
I could use a little help.

23:39.692 --> 23:44.113
Dr. Rosenblatt,
foreplay in Room 7, please.

24:02.715 --> 24:05.384
Honey, I've been waiting all day.

24:06.427 --> 24:11.474
I'm wearing the nightgown
you bought me for our honeymoon.

24:12.933 --> 24:18.731
Tonight's gonna be special. I'll make
love to you for hours and hours.

24:18.939 --> 24:20.900
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?

24:22.693 --> 24:25.362
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.

24:25.529 --> 24:30.242
Why don't I get ready and soak
in the tub for a couple of days?

24:30.451 --> 24:32.411
Possibly a week.

24:32.620 --> 24:37.416
So cute! Let me go and get
the oysters and clams.

25:12.076 --> 25:15.621
Here. I'll shave your back like last time.

25:15.830 --> 25:18.958
Jane, I really don't think we should.

25:19.959 --> 25:24.296
- Frank, what's this?!
- I fell... on a rake.

25:24.463 --> 25:28.426
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.

25:28.592 --> 25:32.596
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear. It's another woman.

25:32.763 --> 25:34.765
In your wildest dreams!

25:34.932 --> 25:39.103
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.

25:39.270 --> 25:41.689
You white Anglo male!

25:41.856 --> 25:48.154
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.159
Some retirement! I'm leaving. I never
thought you'd go back on your word.

25:53.367 --> 25:56.495
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.

25:57.121 --> 26:00.541
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.

26:00.708 --> 26:05.045
How could you? We need
some time apart to think about us.

26:05.212 --> 26:08.424
I'm not going to think.
Why now? I love you.

26:08.591 --> 26:11.719
Look, I am what I am,
and I do what I do.

26:11.886 --> 26:16.515
Some make shoelaces,
some make a living neutering animals.

26:16.682 --> 26:18.976
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.

26:19.143 --> 26:21.270
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!

26:21.437 --> 26:24.398
All right, then take this with you.

26:30.112 --> 26:34.116
I guess you know
how my lips feel about things.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.207
Goodbye, Frank.

26:41.373 --> 26:45.753
<i>Your listening to K.S.A.D.
All depressing, all the time.</i>

26:45.920 --> 26:50.174
<i>Here's a dedication to Frank
from Jane calling from a taxi.</i>

26:50.341 --> 26:54.428
<i>You not only shoot blanks,
you leave the door open,</i>

26:54.595 --> 26:57.181
<i>letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?</i>

26:59.767 --> 27:04.271
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.

27:04.438 --> 27:08.651
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.

27:08.818 --> 27:13.322
There's an article in Cosmo,
"Why All Men Are Pigs". Read it!

27:13.489 --> 27:18.035
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.

27:18.202 --> 27:20.871
I want to get far away from here.

27:21.038 --> 27:25.584
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.

27:25.751 --> 27:28.421
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.

27:28.587 --> 27:32.174
This is the beginning
of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.

27:32.341 --> 27:36.178
No more Miss Perky
who devoted her life to one man.

27:36.345 --> 27:40.099
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!

27:42.977 --> 27:46.272
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.

27:50.401 --> 27:54.697
Calm down. How many bodies
did you find in your pool?

27:54.864 --> 27:59.118
In this state killing a gang member
is only an $18 fine.

27:59.326 --> 28:02.955
- Frank! Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.

28:03.164 --> 28:05.958
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?

28:06.167 --> 28:10.379
I wrote it down on a hanky,
and I can't remember what I did with it.

28:10.546 --> 28:13.758
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.

28:13.924 --> 28:17.553
I brought you some of
"Frank's Never Fail Fudge".

28:17.720 --> 28:20.681
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.

28:20.848 --> 28:25.061
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...

28:26.645 --> 28:30.816
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.

28:30.983 --> 28:34.570
In honor of your 30 years
on the force. Nordberg!

28:37.031 --> 28:41.243
Oh, boy. This is really great.

28:44.038 --> 28:46.332
Thank you, guys.

28:46.540 --> 28:50.086
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.

28:50.252 --> 28:54.507
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.

28:55.382 --> 28:59.553
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?

28:59.720 --> 29:04.767
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!

29:04.934 --> 29:07.520
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.

29:07.728 --> 29:11.148
- Look who's here. Nice to see you.
- Ted.

29:11.315 --> 29:14.819
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?

29:14.985 --> 29:19.198
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...

29:19.407 --> 29:22.201
That's fertilizer. It's for another case.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.870
This is what I'm talking about.

29:25.079 --> 29:29.708
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?

29:29.875 --> 29:31.710
I'd be glad to.

29:31.919 --> 29:35.714
Billions of years ago,
the earth was a molten mass...

29:35.881 --> 29:39.176
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.

29:39.343 --> 29:42.012
Let me take that urine, Frank.

29:42.179 --> 29:45.766
We found a list of
the bomber's plans at the scene.

29:45.933 --> 29:48.769
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?

29:48.936 --> 29:51.731
The paper is from Statesville Prison.

29:51.939 --> 29:53.899
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

29:54.066 --> 30:00.865
The wood is from the rare Canary
Island Pine. It only grows in Oregon.

30:01.031 --> 30:06.036
Contacting paper mills led us
to a distribution center in Tacoma.

30:06.245 --> 30:08.122
There the trail ended.

30:08.289 --> 30:12.418
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.

30:12.626 --> 30:18.048
We compared the handwriting of
all bombers serving in Statesville

30:18.257 --> 30:20.760
and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.

30:20.968 --> 30:23.679
He's masterminding
the bombings from the prison.

30:23.846 --> 30:27.808
If so, there's only one way to find out
where Rocco'll strike next.

30:27.975 --> 30:31.270
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.

30:31.479 --> 30:34.231
I wouldn't feel right about that.

30:34.398 --> 30:36.901
If Rocco finds out,
you might end up dead.

30:37.109 --> 30:39.487
"You might end up dead"
is my middle name.

30:39.653 --> 30:42.239
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.

30:42.406 --> 30:46.368
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.

30:46.535 --> 30:49.413
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.

30:49.580 --> 30:53.084
We're testing a prototype
for a new anti-carjacking device.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.628
You'll get to see how it works.

30:55.836 --> 30:57.713
- Get out!
- No.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.715
Don't make me use...

31:05.012 --> 31:06.430
"The Denver Jockstrap".

31:14.855 --> 31:18.692
<i>After being retired for six months,
I was back in action.</i>

31:18.859 --> 31:23.823
<i>Faster than you say "Spread 'em!",
I was inside Statesville Prison.</i>

31:23.989 --> 31:26.951
<i>I was surrounded by pimps,
rapists and murderers.</i>

31:27.118 --> 31:30.246
<i>It was like being in the stands
of an LA Raiders' game.</i>

31:30.413 --> 31:36.752
<i>It was going to take all my police
experience just to stay alive in here.</i>

31:46.887 --> 31:51.058
<i>After a long and generous cavity
search, I reached my destination:</i>

31:51.225 --> 31:56.313
<i>Maximum security, home of some
of the country's most violent sociopaths.</i>

31:56.480 --> 32:00.693
<i>And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.</i>

32:02.695 --> 32:04.363
All right, in here.

32:04.572 --> 32:09.910
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica! Attica! Power to the brothers.

32:10.077 --> 32:13.414
Kill whitey, kill whitey!

32:13.581 --> 32:15.875
Knock it off!

32:19.420 --> 32:21.547
You're chirping loud for a new canary.

32:21.756 --> 32:25.509
Keep flashing your eyes,
and I'll balance your jaw.

32:25.676 --> 32:31.348
Hey! You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.

32:31.515 --> 32:34.894
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.

32:35.102 --> 32:38.647
Just call me
Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.

32:39.231 --> 32:43.027
Look, ham head. I'm the muscle
in this pen. Stay out of my way.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.529
Just watch your step, Magirk.

32:45.696 --> 32:48.365
Take it from me,
this place changes a man.

32:48.532 --> 32:51.577
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.

32:53.621 --> 32:56.165
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.

32:56.332 --> 33:00.753
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain
you've never felt before.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.923
I know, I remember the Osmonds.

33:04.965 --> 33:08.135
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.

33:08.302 --> 33:12.890
First I'll make a list of the people
I'm gonna kill in the next few days.

33:13.057 --> 33:16.977
<i>Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!</i>

33:19.688 --> 33:22.900
<i>My dearest snookie wookums buns,</i>

33:23.067 --> 33:27.279
<i>I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since...</i>

33:27.488 --> 33:29.782
<i>the last time I was dumped.</i>

33:29.990 --> 33:33.411
<i>I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.</i>

33:34.078 --> 33:35.788
<i>We were supposed to marry,</i>

33:35.996 --> 33:39.875
<i>but on our wedding day,
she never showed up.</i>

33:43.462 --> 33:48.217
<i>I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.</i>

33:48.384 --> 33:51.137
<i>Someone who could do to her
what I never could.</i>

33:51.345 --> 33:56.475
<i>I thought my life was over
until that one glorious day.</i>

33:56.684 --> 34:02.148
<i>That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.</i>

34:02.356 --> 34:06.193
<i>It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.</i>

34:06.360 --> 34:11.322
<i>We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.</i>

34:11.489 --> 34:15.786
<i>I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.</i>

34:15.953 --> 34:19.123
<i>We were going to get
that housekeeper you always wanted.</i>

34:19.290 --> 34:21.500
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.670
<i>I knew that eventually our dream
would come true.</i>

34:24.879 --> 34:28.007
<i>One day we'd have
our own Frank Drebin Jr.</i>

34:28.215 --> 34:30.509
Shut up, Magirk. I'm trying to sleep.

34:30.717 --> 34:33.512
<i>It's no use. She'll never come back.</i>

35:39.495 --> 35:41.539
Bend over and pick it up for me...

35:42.706 --> 35:44.417
...would you, lover?

35:44.583 --> 35:46.252
No problem.

35:57.263 --> 36:01.934
<i>Rocco could tell from my escapade in
the shower that I was courageous.</i>

36:02.143 --> 36:03.978
<i>Now, I had to get on the inside.</i>

36:04.145 --> 36:07.690
<i>Like a blind man at an orgy,
I would have to feel things out.</i>

36:09.817 --> 36:14.864
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.

36:15.030 --> 36:18.033
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!

36:18.200 --> 36:22.371
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.

36:23.330 --> 36:26.459
Got it all worked out right here.

36:28.502 --> 36:32.465
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?

36:32.673 --> 36:35.634
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.

36:35.801 --> 36:39.972
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.

36:40.181 --> 36:43.726
What's so special about a little letter?

36:43.893 --> 36:46.812
Wait a minute... an escape plan!

36:47.521 --> 36:52.902
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...

36:54.695 --> 36:59.116
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.577
This is more like gruel!

37:02.203 --> 37:07.750
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed
to be served slightly chilled.

37:07.917 --> 37:10.044
This is room temperature.

37:10.211 --> 37:14.298
- What do you think we are? Animals?
- No!

37:14.465 --> 37:16.175
What are we?

37:17.343 --> 37:19.178
Homo sapiens?

37:20.221 --> 37:24.809
You're right! We are men!
We are men!

37:24.975 --> 37:28.687
We are men! We are men!

37:56.799 --> 37:59.176
No, no. Stop!

38:02.596 --> 38:06.892
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?

38:16.110 --> 38:19.989
Come on, son. You can do it.
Eat some beans.

38:41.719 --> 38:46.057
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.

38:46.223 --> 38:49.185
You've been handling yourself
really good.

38:49.351 --> 38:51.395
- Really well.
- Whatever.

38:51.604 --> 38:55.733
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.486
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?

38:58.652 --> 39:03.783
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.

39:03.949 --> 39:06.619
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.

39:06.786 --> 39:10.122
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.792
They've got Tyrone.

39:14.043 --> 39:17.588
Can't we all just get along?

39:22.885 --> 39:26.430
<i>Now that Tyrone was in solitary,
it was just me and Rocco.</i>

39:26.639 --> 39:30.434
<i>He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh! Hold on!</i>

39:31.102 --> 39:34.438
<i>Anyway, I convinced Rocco
to dig a tunnel.</i>

39:34.605 --> 39:36.732
<i>It was either that or the laundry truck.</i>

39:36.899 --> 39:40.361
<i>The thought of lying nose down
in underwear with skid marks</i>

39:40.528 --> 39:42.446
<i>didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.</i>

39:47.660 --> 39:51.539
<i>Disposing of the dirt
was a problem I solved early.</i>

39:51.705 --> 39:55.459
<i>Outside of some major chaffing,
we made good progress.</i>

39:55.626 --> 40:00.923
<i>We kept digging, and dummies gave
the impression we were in our cell.</i>

40:01.090 --> 40:02.508
Lights out, Magirk.

40:02.716 --> 40:07.012
<i>There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.</i>

40:29.535 --> 40:30.535
Safe!

40:44.717 --> 40:48.387
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?

40:48.596 --> 40:52.892
- They are playing our song.
- I understand. Take your time.

41:09.825 --> 41:11.410
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.

41:11.619 --> 41:14.538
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.540
- Why don't you come?
- No.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.417
- How about a kiss?
- No!

41:18.626 --> 41:23.255
I know women mean "yes" when they
say "no". How about that kiss?

41:23.464 --> 41:26.258
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?

41:26.467 --> 41:28.886
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.

41:43.192 --> 41:46.946
- You killed him!
- It was an accident. Call the police.

41:47.113 --> 41:52.493
Come to your senses. You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!

41:52.660 --> 41:54.787
Call Frank. He'll protect us.

41:54.995 --> 41:57.915
He's a man. He'll lock you away for life.

42:00.501 --> 42:04.046
I wanna help you
kill as many men as possible.

42:07.174 --> 42:09.802
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.

42:15.349 --> 42:20.771
Be home, Frank, please. Answer
the phone, snuggie pants. Frank!

42:20.980 --> 42:23.816
<i>- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane. We're the Drebins.</i>

42:23.983 --> 42:27.945
<i>We're not home right now.
Leave a message.</i>

42:29.238 --> 42:32.241
<i>- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.</i>

42:42.835 --> 42:46.839
Tanya? It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.

42:47.047 --> 42:51.969
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet
they're there right now. Oh, Frank!

42:52.136 --> 42:54.847
Cell inspection!

42:56.182 --> 42:59.351
There's been a rumor
of a possible break-out.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.731
If we suspect anyone
of attempting to escape,

43:03.898 --> 43:06.525
they will be punished severely.

43:07.610 --> 43:11.572
<i>Once word of the escape was out,
we had to move for the tunnel.</i>

43:11.739 --> 43:13.866
<i>The last few feet
had to be dug on the run.</i>

43:14.075 --> 43:18.204
<i>We were sure that another 47 yards
would take us beyond the prison walls.</i>

43:18.412 --> 43:22.792
May he rest in peace in the arms
of our loving... Jesus Christ!

43:22.958 --> 43:23.958
Amen.

43:24.752 --> 43:27.880
<i>Rocco had arranged for
a getaway car to meet us.</i>

43:30.132 --> 43:34.345
<i>After adjusting our direction,
we arrived at the rendezvous point...</i>

43:35.054 --> 43:37.056
<i>... a Los Angeles city high school.</i>

43:51.237 --> 43:55.199
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?

43:55.366 --> 43:58.702
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!

43:59.912 --> 44:03.916
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless,
sadistic, cold-blooded animal.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.627
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.

44:06.794 --> 44:11.173
Ma, I want you to meet a real
square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.

44:11.340 --> 44:13.509
There are fresh clothes in the back.

44:13.676 --> 44:19.515
<i>Rocco's mother was quiet. I sensed
she didn't like me coming along.</i>

44:20.307 --> 44:25.438
<i>Like a midget at a urinal,
I would have to stay on my toes.</i>

44:36.699 --> 44:38.699
Hey! Stop!

44:42.580 --> 44:44.081
Oh, Frank!

44:59.847 --> 45:03.893
It wasn't my fault. That cow
shouldn't have been on the road.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.145
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!

45:06.353 --> 45:08.731
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.

45:08.898 --> 45:13.360
No phones. Miles from the nearest
town. Playboy Channel. Perfect.

45:13.527 --> 45:19.116
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?

45:19.950 --> 45:24.413
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.

45:24.580 --> 45:27.917
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.

45:49.105 --> 45:53.359
<i>It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.</i>

45:53.567 --> 45:57.238
<i>I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.</i>

45:57.405 --> 46:00.866
<i>If she made me as a cop,
I'd be tonight's meat loaf.</i>

46:01.075 --> 46:05.538
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman. I can tell.

46:05.746 --> 46:08.749
Hey, she's referring to me.

46:08.916 --> 46:12.670
I was talking about your mother.

46:13.796 --> 46:16.799
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.

46:16.966 --> 46:20.511
And what are you doing
in my bathing suit?

46:20.678 --> 46:26.308
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.

46:26.475 --> 46:29.395
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.

46:29.562 --> 46:32.523
Don't I know you from somewhere?

46:32.732 --> 46:35.860
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.

46:36.026 --> 46:38.863
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.

46:39.655 --> 46:42.700
Are you saying you're not a cop?

46:42.867 --> 46:44.869
Well, yeah.

46:45.035 --> 46:47.496
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.

46:47.663 --> 46:49.707
I'm glad that's all cleared up.

46:50.416 --> 46:53.878
Ma, why don't you two
kiss and make up?

46:54.044 --> 46:56.046
Well, all right.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.559
That's more like it.

47:30.164 --> 47:32.208
<i>I had to get a message to the squad.</i>

47:32.374 --> 47:35.294
<i>This was more
than I could handle by myself.</i>

47:35.503 --> 47:40.674
<i>No phone and miles from people, I was
worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.</i>

47:40.841 --> 47:42.385
Who's there?

47:43.803 --> 47:47.139
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?

47:48.516 --> 47:50.559
Pigeon? What pigeon?

47:51.268 --> 47:54.772
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

47:54.980 --> 47:57.316
...contemplating my next move.

47:57.525 --> 47:59.819
Your bishop is exposed.

47:59.985 --> 48:03.823
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.

48:03.989 --> 48:06.951
You're all man.
I like that in my men.

48:07.118 --> 48:10.955
You're coming on to me big time,
purring like a kitten with a mouse.

48:11.122 --> 48:13.249
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?

48:13.416 --> 48:16.168
No. You're Rocco's girl.

48:16.335 --> 48:20.715
In my book that chapter is called
"Look, But Don't Touch".

48:22.466 --> 48:24.468
I could have two lovers.

48:26.303 --> 48:29.807
Kinky. But I like my sex
the way I play basketball,

48:30.015 --> 48:33.978
one on one and with
as little dribbling as possible.

48:41.026 --> 48:44.447
You're tense, Slasher.

48:44.613 --> 48:48.033
I could relax more,
if I knew what was on tomorrow.

48:48.242 --> 48:51.328
Do you know anything about that?

48:51.495 --> 48:56.709
All I know is that it's downtown
and... big.

48:56.917 --> 49:01.505
That's the way I like it. What else?

49:01.672 --> 49:03.758
Just this...

49:07.094 --> 49:10.222
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.

49:10.389 --> 49:14.060
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?

49:14.268 --> 49:16.562
You shove your tongue
as far down as you can.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.817
Quiet. You're not supposed
to know me here.

49:21.984 --> 49:23.986
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.

49:24.153 --> 49:28.741
- What's this? Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.

49:28.949 --> 49:31.160
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.

49:31.327 --> 49:34.789
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?

49:34.955 --> 49:37.958
- He will. He must be great.
- He breaks promises.

49:38.125 --> 49:41.253
And you traipse all over
to spite a wonderful guy.

49:41.420 --> 49:43.381
- He left me.
- You left him.

49:43.547 --> 49:46.717
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.

49:46.884 --> 49:49.678
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!

49:49.845 --> 49:53.057
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.

49:53.224 --> 49:56.435
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure...

49:56.644 --> 50:00.189
...there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.

50:00.356 --> 50:04.235
- Let's plug her.
- No. I was on a job that went hooey.

50:04.402 --> 50:08.906
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a
hostage. Women make the best ones.

50:09.073 --> 50:12.868
They are smaller, easy to take along,
eat less, smell nice.

50:13.035 --> 50:17.623
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.

50:17.832 --> 50:22.753
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.

50:27.967 --> 50:31.178
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.

50:31.345 --> 50:36.892
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?

50:38.269 --> 50:43.482
On the top of that tower is a device
that's going to net us five million bucks.

50:43.691 --> 50:46.652
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening

50:46.861 --> 50:49.280
at an event the whole world
will be watching.

50:49.447 --> 50:52.950
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.

50:53.159 --> 50:55.661
- All set?
- Set.

51:18.059 --> 51:21.259
Very impressive.

51:21.645 --> 51:22.645
Cool.

51:24.356 --> 51:25.356
Cool.

51:30.404 --> 51:34.033
America will be brought to its knees
by this terrorist act.

51:34.241 --> 51:38.079
It'll be more embarrassing to the US
than Tonya Harding.

51:38.245 --> 51:41.707
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.

51:41.916 --> 51:45.044
And tell her thanks for the cookies.

51:47.338 --> 51:49.382
<i>It's another beautiful night in LA,</i>

51:49.590 --> 51:54.345
<i>and the stars are shining bright
for the 66th annual Academy Awards.</i>

51:54.512 --> 51:57.640
<i>Fans are clamoring
to see their favorite celebrities.</i>

51:57.807 --> 52:01.560
<i>Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic
and Vanna White.</i>

52:12.780 --> 52:14.865
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.

52:15.032 --> 52:18.994
I'll meet you and Ma
around the back in ten minutes.

52:19.161 --> 52:21.580
Got the passes?

52:21.789 --> 52:25.209
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.

52:25.418 --> 52:28.462
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.

52:28.629 --> 52:31.257
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.

52:31.465 --> 52:33.843
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.

52:34.009 --> 52:38.347
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.

52:42.518 --> 52:46.939
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, to present
the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...</i>

52:47.106 --> 52:52.695
Ready, 3. Roll tape. Go to clip.
Aspirin, please. Go to 3. Ready, 4.

52:54.655 --> 53:00.578
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award
winner's credits include great films.

53:00.745 --> 53:04.623
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.

53:04.832 --> 53:07.460
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.

53:07.626 --> 53:09.962
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960,

53:10.171 --> 53:15.801
and his first color feature in 1966,
"Big Shiny Spears".

53:21.724 --> 53:24.894
There's the man
from Bryce/Porterhouse.

53:25.061 --> 53:30.107
He guards the envelopes until they're
handed out. He won't budge from there.

53:30.316 --> 53:33.736
Distract him so I can plant the bomb
in an envelope.

53:33.903 --> 53:38.115
<i>Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz
is Margaret Red Feather.</i>

53:55.841 --> 53:58.094
That ought to do it.

53:58.260 --> 54:02.014
You'll pay for this. Rocco'll kill you
whoever you are.

54:02.181 --> 54:05.768
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?

54:05.935 --> 54:09.855
- It happened to me. Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.

54:10.022 --> 54:13.192
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.

54:13.401 --> 54:18.280
I'm the good guy. I can't let the bad guys
win. Our children can't be raised in fear.

54:18.447 --> 54:22.743
If we can't stop them, they'll blow
that place up. It'll be a tragedy,

54:22.910 --> 54:26.455
unless it happens during
a dance number. Come on.

54:43.597 --> 54:46.058
Does that radio work?

54:50.938 --> 54:54.650
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...

55:00.781 --> 55:02.781
Forget it.

55:03.075 --> 55:06.203
I wonder what the devil he wanted?

55:11.584 --> 55:14.587
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.

55:14.795 --> 55:18.507
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.

55:18.674 --> 55:23.304
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along. Movie stars only.

55:23.471 --> 55:26.515
Come on. I've got a better idea.

55:26.682 --> 55:28.267
And cue talent.

55:28.476 --> 55:31.270
<i>To present the award
for Best Supporting Actress...</i>

55:31.812 --> 55:34.774
<i>... Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.</i>

55:44.658 --> 55:45.951
Thank you.

55:46.118 --> 55:49.080
The nominees
for Best Supporting Actress are:

55:49.288 --> 55:51.582
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair",

55:51.749 --> 55:55.044
one woman's ordeal to overcome
the death of her cat,

55:55.211 --> 55:57.922
set against the background
of the Hindenburg disaster.

56:04.011 --> 56:06.555
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal",

56:06.722 --> 56:10.935
one courageous pioneer woman's
triumphant victory over bulimia,

56:11.102 --> 56:13.771
set against the background
of the Donner Party Crossing.

56:31.956 --> 56:34.417
Sorry, but this is official police business.

56:37.712 --> 56:39.922
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis",

56:40.089 --> 56:42.508
one woman's triumph
over a yeast infection,

56:42.675 --> 56:46.762
set against the background of the tragic
Buffalo Bill season of 1991.

56:57.189 --> 56:59.316
Thank you, sheriff.

56:59.483 --> 57:02.194
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.

57:02.361 --> 57:04.697
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.

57:16.917 --> 57:21.047
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown. Is that Cool Whip?

57:21.213 --> 57:25.384
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.

57:26.093 --> 57:29.638
Let's see. Vanna White
and "Weird Al" Yankovic.

57:29.805 --> 57:30.805
OK!

57:32.516 --> 57:33.893
Ready, 3... and 3.

57:34.060 --> 57:36.979
And Florence Henderson,
"Analysis of a Proposal"...

57:38.189 --> 57:41.400
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.

57:41.567 --> 57:44.737
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.

57:44.904 --> 57:47.364
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

57:47.531 --> 57:50.659
Yes. Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.

57:50.826 --> 57:54.580
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!

57:54.789 --> 57:57.041
And the winner is...

57:58.250 --> 58:00.586
...Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".

58:04.048 --> 58:07.051
I'm sorry, we were rooting
for Florence Henderson.

58:07.218 --> 58:10.054
We've got to get to the envelopes.

58:19.355 --> 58:22.858
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.

58:23.025 --> 58:25.403
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?

58:25.569 --> 58:29.949
<i>Best Director is presented by star
of stage and screen Raquel Welch</i>

58:30.157 --> 58:33.786
<i>and host of his own award-winning
talk show Phil Donahue.</i>

58:33.994 --> 58:37.790
That might be the envelope
for the bomb. Keep looking here.

58:37.957 --> 58:40.793
One more second, Mr. Donahue.

58:56.142 --> 58:59.395
Oh, my God! Look at Donahue.

59:06.318 --> 59:09.155
Stop the stairs, Joey. Joey!

59:11.449 --> 59:15.453
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my pleasure to present the...

59:21.417 --> 59:22.668
What the hell?!

59:25.421 --> 59:27.840
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.

59:28.049 --> 59:31.886
Easy now. Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?

59:32.053 --> 59:35.347
Slasher is Frank Drebin
of Police Squad.

59:35.514 --> 59:41.228
Lousy, two-bit copper! I treated him
like my brother... the one I didn't kill.

59:41.395 --> 59:45.274
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.

59:46.358 --> 59:51.030
<i>- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike. Cue Donahue.</i>

59:54.325 --> 59:56.285
Read it. Read the card, moron.

59:59.914 --> 01:00:03.959
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is
a special evening. Phew!"

01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:06.921
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."

01:00:07.088 --> 01:00:10.424
"Raquel: I'm used to being out of breath,
working out to my..."

01:00:10.591 --> 01:00:11.967
What's he doing?!

01:00:12.134 --> 01:00:16.847
"Hold for laughter. To Phil. Gets me
out of breath just watching you."

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:20.351
- "To Raquel. Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.

01:00:20.518 --> 01:00:24.271
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."

01:00:24.438 --> 01:00:29.318
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough

01:00:29.485 --> 01:00:34.073
for his musical based on the life
of Mother Teresa, "Mother".

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.617
<i>Food, I love food
and I'm really in the mood</i>

01:00:36.784 --> 01:00:40.287
<i>for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter
two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter</i>

01:00:40.454 --> 01:00:43.416
<i>and some tuna helper,
I'll be racing back for more</i>

01:00:43.582 --> 01:00:47.211
<i>But don't get any sausage
'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor</i>

01:00:55.761 --> 01:00:59.223
Spike Lee, "X II - The Merchandising"

01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:03.853
Nordberg, look. That's Frank
at the Academy Awards.

01:01:04.019 --> 01:01:06.313
How did he get tickets?

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.069
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to
strike next, the Academy Awards.

01:01:12.278 --> 01:01:15.698
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited. We're cops.

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:22.371
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.

01:01:22.538 --> 01:01:25.138
Hello. Hello.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:29.003
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.883
<i>And now, here are today's
lucky lotto numbers.</i>

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:40.556
<i>Get your tickets ready because
here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.</i>

01:01:40.723 --> 01:01:45.144
And for his tale of genetics gone
haywire in a retirement community,

01:01:45.311 --> 01:01:48.731
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:11.879
And the winner is...

01:02:13.672 --> 01:02:15.800
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.302
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:21.472
<i>This show is being seen
all over the world, I was thinking</i>

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.850
if we could all send good thoughts
through these cameras

01:02:25.017 --> 01:02:29.855
to men like the leader of China,
Wing Wa Woo Tong,

01:02:30.022 --> 01:02:33.484
so that they might finally be nice.

01:02:33.651 --> 01:02:35.651
Thank you.

01:02:37.238 --> 01:02:39.532
And the winner is...

01:02:39.698 --> 01:02:45.621
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry
in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.

01:02:45.788 --> 01:02:51.210
Each time I go to the zoo and see those
porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:54.213
I think, "What a waste that is."

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.593
Butcher half of them now! That's a lot of
dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats,

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.264
freeing up that tuna
for our nation's hungry.

01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:12.857
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold,

01:03:13.065 --> 01:03:18.571
shivering in the night. So I say,
"Take those cats, skin them."

01:03:18.738 --> 01:03:23.826
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.

01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:26.787
And the winner is...

01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:37.131
- You!
- Give me that!

01:03:45.181 --> 01:03:49.143
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.

01:03:50.978 --> 01:03:53.856
It's OK. It's not the bomb.

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:06.410
<i>- Jane. Jane!
- Big trouble!</i>

01:04:08.871 --> 01:04:09.871
Jane.

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:17.171
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.007
That's the guy!

01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:27.765
<i>Please welcome internationally
renowned actress and singing star</i>

01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:31.532
<i>Pia Zadora.</i>

01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:40.694
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot? Where?

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:52.123
Oh, no. Not him again. Please, God.

01:05:51.057 --> 01:05:52.641
Get off the stage!

01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:05.905
Ed Hocken and Nordberg
from Police Squad.

01:06:06.072 --> 01:06:09.450
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.

01:06:16.123 --> 01:06:17.541
It's Frank.

01:06:32.973 --> 01:06:35.726
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.

01:07:06.632 --> 01:07:07.632
Jane!

01:07:13.055 --> 01:07:14.055
Jane!

01:07:15.725 --> 01:07:20.688
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.

01:07:20.855 --> 01:07:22.523
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.192
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club
long ago.

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:28.112
Angel drawers,
you've got one last chance.

01:07:28.279 --> 01:07:32.283
Not one of those Major-League-
Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:35.161
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.

01:07:35.327 --> 01:07:38.247
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.

01:07:38.414 --> 01:07:42.209
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.

01:07:42.376 --> 01:07:47.965
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me. Please, kiss me.

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:52.595
I've never kissed lips
so innocent, so pure.

01:08:12.948 --> 01:08:17.411
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair. That's the guy.

01:08:19.412 --> 01:08:24.210
<i>To present the Best Picture Award
are two very distinguished actors.</i>

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:27.380
Olympia Dukakis
and James Earl Jones.

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:40.309
- Oh, Lord. What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.

01:08:40.475 --> 01:08:44.438
Make a note about not having
Phil Donahue back next year.

01:08:44.604 --> 01:08:46.774
Thank you. Good evening.

01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:51.028
It's a privilege to present
the final award of tonight's ceremony.

01:08:51.737 --> 01:08:55.323
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?

01:08:55.491 --> 01:08:58.661
- Sit down. Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.

01:08:58.828 --> 01:09:03.374
"Indecent Instincts"
and "Sawdust and Mildew".

01:09:03.582 --> 01:09:07.837
Oddly enough, all these movies
are box office hits, except one.

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:12.174
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.

01:09:12.341 --> 01:09:14.343
Olympia, would you do the honors?

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:17.263
Oh, my God. That's the one!

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:21.142
The award for this year's
best picture goes to...

01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:23.602
- Wait!
- Oh, great.

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:28.899
Sorry. Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too. Let me open this.

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:35.488
It's the bomb!

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:48.127
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!

01:09:49.336 --> 01:09:51.796
Well, from now on.

01:09:51.964 --> 01:09:56.761
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:10:00.598
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.

01:10:00.765 --> 01:10:02.725
Better move back, 2.

01:10:02.892 --> 01:10:06.312
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!

01:10:06.479 --> 01:10:09.607
I don't want to kill anybody
unless I have to.

01:10:10.232 --> 01:10:12.568
Drop your guns
and kick them over here.

01:10:17.114 --> 01:10:20.993
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.829
You want to do the honors
of killing him, Ma?

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:27.208
Blink, and I start shooting.

01:10:32.838 --> 01:10:34.799
Give me that gun.

01:10:35.716 --> 01:10:39.428
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.

01:10:54.693 --> 01:10:56.946
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.

01:10:57.113 --> 01:11:01.784
Dead? Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!

01:11:03.411 --> 01:11:07.790
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco. All right.

01:11:07.957 --> 01:11:11.460
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.

01:11:11.627 --> 01:11:14.672
You pull out the bomb,
you'll kill me and everyone else.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.258
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.

01:11:17.425 --> 01:11:21.011
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.

01:11:21.178 --> 01:11:26.350
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.

01:11:26.517 --> 01:11:29.729
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.

01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:33.858
- Jane?
- I'd be safe. So would everyone else.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:37.611
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.

01:11:37.778 --> 01:11:43.159
Let's be logical. You're the psycho,
you should have this and I the gun.

01:11:43.325 --> 01:11:45.870
I know what I'm doing.

01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.210
All right.

01:11:55.504 --> 01:11:58.674
Here's your Best Picture,
in front of a worldwide audience.

01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:04.221
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:07.516
Wait, Rocco,
before we're all blown to bits.

01:12:07.683 --> 01:12:11.937
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my
crack? A man's got to go comfortable.

01:12:12.104 --> 01:12:15.274
All right, but that's it.

01:12:16.734 --> 01:12:20.362
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!

01:12:23.949 --> 01:12:26.368
Come and get me.

01:12:28.913 --> 01:12:31.374
Throw me a gun. Get rid of the bomb.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.833
Hold on.

01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:37.213
Frank, help me!

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.423
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.

01:12:42.843 --> 01:12:45.179
I hate heights.

01:12:48.516 --> 01:12:49.809
Move it.

01:12:51.936 --> 01:12:53.813
Screw the commercials!

01:12:53.979 --> 01:12:58.567
All right, copper. You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.

01:12:59.568 --> 01:13:03.531
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.

01:13:03.697 --> 01:13:06.700
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!

01:13:06.867 --> 01:13:12.039
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.

01:13:12.206 --> 01:13:15.584
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.

01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:18.587
I want the world to know
you're the perfect man.

01:13:18.754 --> 01:13:22.550
<i>- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.</i>

01:13:22.717 --> 01:13:26.512
I was wrong to take you
away from Police Squad.

01:13:26.679 --> 01:13:31.434
I know now that's why
you couldn't perform sexually.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.520
I realize that
and a lot of other things now.

01:13:34.687 --> 01:13:36.856
Everything's under control.

01:13:37.022 --> 01:13:40.651
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.

01:13:42.319 --> 01:13:44.572
Frank, I've learned my lesson.

01:13:44.739 --> 01:13:50.244
Even though it may be too late for me,
I want all ladies out there to remember:

01:13:50.411 --> 01:13:52.955
Don't ever take your men for granted.

01:13:53.122 --> 01:13:56.083
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.

01:14:01.172 --> 01:14:04.425
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.

01:14:05.885 --> 01:14:07.085
Hurry.

01:14:15.394 --> 01:14:16.812
I'm coming, Ma!

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.695
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:41.087
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.

01:14:41.253 --> 01:14:46.300
Oh, Frank, you like me,
you really like me.

01:15:05.903 --> 01:15:08.781
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!

01:15:08.948 --> 01:15:12.034
- Relax. Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.

01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:15.705
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room. This must be it.

01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:19.500
<i>Jane, I'm here. Frank is here now.</i>

01:15:19.667 --> 01:15:23.170
- Push! Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.

01:15:23.337 --> 01:15:28.634
One more push. That's it.
Congratulations, Dad. It's a boy.

01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:34.974
Nordberg! Come back here!

01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:38.769
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
