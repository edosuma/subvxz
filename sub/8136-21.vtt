00:27.327 --> 00:29.522
Who or what is that?

00:30.063 --> 00:31.758
That's what
I wanna find out.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.460
You just
saved my skin.

00:38.571 --> 00:41.062
Whether you like it or not,
we're after the same thing,

00:41.174 --> 00:42.641
so why don't we
pool our resources?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.835
I work alone.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.879
Well, I never imagined you
as a government employee.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.470
I'm not.
Not officially.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.140
So what are you
officially?

00:50.216 --> 00:51.843
Just a guy who
shows up here and there.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.357
I got a rocket launcher
to knock out. Michael...

01:03.430 --> 01:04.488
Look above you.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.531
Oh, no!

01:05.598 --> 01:06.895
Don't tell me that's David.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.228
Who else?

01:08.334 --> 01:09.665
Get them out!

01:11.538 --> 01:13.096
We'll never
survive a direct hit.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.697
Then we're gonna
have to outrun him, pal.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.896
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:37.964 --> 01:40.364
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:40.433 --> 01:42.492
who does not exist.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.567
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:50.643 --> 01:53.168
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:53.246 --> 01:55.441
the helpless, the powerless,

01:55.515 --> 01:58.712
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:19.832 --> 03:20.856
Wonderful.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.060
Nice!

03:27.874 --> 03:29.739
Thank you, my darling.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.879
My friends,

03:34.380 --> 03:36.610
we have some refreshments
down below.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.241
Please come
with me.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.498
Eduardo.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.508
We've just
received a message.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.807
They have got
to move tonight.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.212
Make the necessary
arrangements.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.841
Yes, operator.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.474
I would like
Calexico, California.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.237
Look, I don't care
what time it is, Elmo.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.828
You get your butt out there.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.635
They're expecting that delivery
at Boca Culebra by dawn.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.650
Friday, 2:30 a.m.

09:12.418 --> 09:15.353
It's the third crossing.
Same vehicles.

09:15.421 --> 09:18.254
A van and two trucks,
one heavily guarded.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.017
I'm gonna try and follow the
vehicles to their destination.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.475
Hey!
Over there!

09:48.888 --> 09:49.980
Stop!

09:50.256 --> 09:51.382
Stop!

10:11.043 --> 10:13.477
That's Mexico
across the border, KITT.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.036
What do you think?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.708
I think it looks
exactly like California.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.442
Some traveler you'd make.

10:20.519 --> 10:23.955
Michael, I really don't understand
borders and different countries.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.752
You're all people,
aren't you?

10:25.825 --> 10:29.090
Sure, but we've got different
languages, cultures, customs.

10:29.161 --> 10:32.289
Of course, but why
compartmentalize yourselves?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.526
Wouldn't it be easier
to just live together

10:34.600 --> 10:36.693
without all these
artificial lines?

10:36.802 --> 10:37.860
Probably,

10:37.970 --> 10:40.404
but you'd sure put a lot of
politicians out of business.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.872
Very funny.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.902
Well, Michael, what do
you think of Calexico?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.569
Looks good so far.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.341
You sure this is
where she's staying?

10:48.414 --> 10:49.438
Yes, Michael.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.881
This is the address
Devon gave us.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.323
Look at that.
"Payoff suspected. "

10:58.724 --> 11:00.351
You know what they did.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.356
They killed him.
They murdered him.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.627
And then stuffed
$5,000 in his pocket

11:05.698 --> 11:08.189
and left him lying in the dust
like a common criminal.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.464
You said your husband was
killed because he got too close.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.231
Too close to what?

11:14.106 --> 11:15.573
I don't know.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.908
Arthur worked for
the Attorney General's office.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.345
He often handled cases
he couldn't talk about.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.906
Joanna, since this was
a federal investigation,

11:24.984 --> 11:27.748
maybe you should let
the government look into it.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.844
Oh, no.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.989
The government,
in its infinite wisdom

11:32.058 --> 11:33.719
would pursue this
with the ardor

11:33.793 --> 11:36.193
and alacrity of
a hippopotamus.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.254
I need somebody who can
function outside the bureaucracy.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.196
That's why I
called the Foundation.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.733
All right.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.860
You said you went through
Arthur's things.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.063
Did you find
anything useful?

11:47.406 --> 11:48.873
I'm not sure.

11:49.575 --> 11:52.305
I found this
scribbled in his checkbook.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.045
"Boca Culebra. "

11:55.114 --> 11:56.843
Mouth of the Snake.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.077
I have no idea
of its significance,

11:59.151 --> 12:01.142
if it's significant at all.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.385
And this.

12:03.689 --> 12:07.284
I found this hidden under
the seat of his rented car.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.066
Are you sure this is
where they found him?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.502
I came out with
the police. Why?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.438
Because there hasn't
been much traffic

12:22.508 --> 12:24.305
through here
except for these tracks

12:24.376 --> 12:26.901
and they run parallel
to the border, not across it.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.845
KITT, what have you
got on these tracks, huh?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.515
Are you talking to me?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.280
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.877
KITT,
say hello to Joanna.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.388
Hello, Joanna.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.651
That's my computer,
my partner, and my friend.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.090
Thank you, Michael.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.424
The size of the tracks
indicate a larger tire,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.760
probably on a
four-wheel drive vehicle.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.163
The treads
indicate newer tires.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.832
Michael.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.267
Arthur's rental was
a new four-wheel drive.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.703
Come on, hop in.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.708
Let's find out where
those tracks come from.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.795
Michael, the tracks end here.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.648
It looks like an army
moved through here.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.484
Michael?

13:44.490 --> 13:48.392
This looks like the same piece
of pottery you found in his car.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.791
Hey, KITT, take a look at this
and give me a reading on it.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.297
Right away, Michael.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.927
The material is
composed of fine particles

13:57.036 --> 13:59.061
of hydrous
aluminum silicates.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.230
Yeah, in other words,
clay. I know that.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.173
There is also an unusual
concentration of gold flakings

14:04.243 --> 14:06.575
on the inside of
each piece of material.

14:10.549 --> 14:11.573
Gold?

14:11.650 --> 14:12.639
Yes.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.083
My guess is
the clay was molded

14:14.153 --> 14:16.781
around a rather
substantial core of pure gold.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.169
All right, look, the odds are I
won't find a thing out there tonight.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.175
But if I do,

14:38.244 --> 14:40.735
it's not gonna be anything
you should be involved with.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.646
Well, thanks for the concern,
but I already am involved.

14:44.416 --> 14:47.351
And I've never cared much
for the sidelines.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.689
Michael, I respect your
professional judgment.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.315
But Arthur
was my husband.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.121
I can't just
stand by and hope

14:55.194 --> 14:57.094
that someone
finds his murderer.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.030
I'll go along
with you this time.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.230
Fair warning, though.
Once is my limit.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.771
Okay.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.477
You've had your say.
Now it's my turn.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.813
Joanna,

15:21.353 --> 15:24.845
I've never been married,
but I've been in love

15:24.924 --> 15:27.586
and I know how hard
it is to lose that.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.093
Look, I can only guess

15:29.161 --> 15:31.391
what you're going through
right now,

15:31.463 --> 15:34.864
but I know it's probably the
hardest thing you ever had to face.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.502
Joanna, you're stretched
tighter than a drum.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.196
I can see it
in your eyes.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.241
You know,
it's okay to cry.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.705
You see a guy come
running out here a second ago?

16:17.776 --> 16:20.711
Nope. You've got the
whole track to yourself.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.506
Keep an eye
on that guy, KITT.

16:25.584 --> 16:26.846
If he's got a car,
trace it.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.614
I've got him in my sights.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.807
Check target
eye position.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.071
Many years ago,

16:53.145 --> 16:56.171
a Yaqui shaman told me
that the history of mankind

16:56.248 --> 16:58.113
is a history of war.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.947
If that is true,
and I believe it to be,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.079
you and I will
soon stand together

17:03.155 --> 17:06.954
shoulder to shoulder among the
greatest warriors of the past.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.884
You can have
the notoriety, Eduardo.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.560
I will settle
for the money.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.464
Well, I will settle
for nothing less than both.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.404
I'm not sure
what's going on down here,

17:28.480 --> 17:30.414
but it's a lot more
than illegal aliens

17:30.482 --> 17:33.076
and a lawyer framed to look
like he was in on the take.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.212
Well, the gold you mentioned
would certainly confirm that.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.915
I'll see what I can turn up,
Michael.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.187
KITT ran a trace on a guy
outside Joanna's motel.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.282
Any luck?

17:42.428 --> 17:44.259
We're making some progress.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.263
His name is David Dalton.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.027
His present address
is Washington, DC,

17:49.435 --> 17:51.903
but he's been there
for less than a year.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.938
What does this guy
do for a living?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.474
I'm feeding all
the information to KITT now.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.066
Thanks, Devon.
I'll keep you posted.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.975
So, the plot thickens.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.905
Bet this guy David Dalton's
not down in Mexico

18:03.982 --> 18:05.847
looking for the world's
greatest burrito.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
And what are we looking for?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.179
We are going back
to the border, pal,

18:10.255 --> 18:12.951
to see if
lightning strikes twice.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.745
KITT, can you give me a reading
on what's inside those trucks?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.910
Yes, Michael. The
vans are carrying people.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.045
The truck is filled
with crates of...

18:43.122 --> 18:44.146
Pottery.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.384
All right, just what
I figured. Make like a decoy.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.926
I wanna get inside that truck
and take a closer look.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.634
Whoa!

18:58.937 --> 18:59.926
Stop!

19:08.747 --> 19:10.237
Let's get him!

19:12.885 --> 19:14.512
Let's follow him!

19:39.378 --> 19:41.403
I think this has gone far enough.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.674
Adios, amigos.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.750
Come on back.
Come on back.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.057
Come on straight back.
Come on back.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.261
That's it.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.597
All right,
let's get it unloaded.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.168
Come on, move!

21:15.540 --> 21:17.337
You got the
tailgate down.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.070
Come on, let's move it!

21:31.657 --> 21:32.749
Out.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.353
Who are you?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.189
Oh, I'm a...
I'm a hitchhiker.

21:36.261 --> 21:37.558
Is this
San Diego?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.096
Not exactly, pal.

21:39.164 --> 21:40.461
Oh, sorry.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.621
Ah.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.097
Get over here.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.763
Up against the wall.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.665
Hey, wait a minute!

22:30.115 --> 22:32.174
KITT, if you're
out there, I need you.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.266
Cut him off!

23:17.095 --> 23:20.531
Michael, who or what is that?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.491
That's what I wanna find out.

23:22.601 --> 23:23.727
It's quite extraordinary.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.962
I've never seen a human being
move like that.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.021
Hang on, hang on.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.788
I think we're on
the same side here.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.703
My name's Michael Knight.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.202
KITT, get Devon.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.674
Tell him to send someone
out to the warehouse ASAP.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.677
I want those guards busted
and out of the way

24:06.745 --> 24:07.973
so no one will find them.

24:08.046 --> 24:09.775
I'll hang here
until somebody gets here.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.543
I'll get right on it, Michael.

24:11.616 --> 24:12.674
Oh.

24:13.318 --> 24:14.717
It's a computer.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.983
It's replacing the dog
as man's best friend.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.727
Don't worry,
he doesn't bite.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.820
It's not that.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.865
I just don't have
much use for them.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.197
All they've ever done
is screw up my bank account

24:30.302 --> 24:31.462
and send me mail
I don't need.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.696
I beg your pardon?

24:32.804 --> 24:34.635
Not now, KITT.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.265
Somehow I knew
it wasn't an accident

24:37.375 --> 24:40.572
seeing you outside
that motel in Calexico.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.638
Look, you just
saved my skin.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.309
And whether you like it or
not, we're after the same thing

24:46.384 --> 24:48.352
so why don't we
pool our resources?

24:48.854 --> 24:49.980
I work alone.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.149
Me, too, but I don't
make a religion out of it.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.291
All right, cards on the table.
Your name's David Dalton,

24:57.362 --> 24:59.887
you live in Washington, DC,
you're seldom there,

24:59.965 --> 25:02.433
you have a quote-unquote
"unofficial relationship"

25:02.534 --> 25:05.594
with a former Department of
Justice VIP named Archibald Hendley.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.467
You disappear
weeks at a time

25:07.539 --> 25:10.099
doing things you couldn't
discuss at cocktail parties.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.573
Those are
the highlights.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.873
I'm working
on the details.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.173
Michael Knight.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.306
Work for the Foundation
for Law and Government

25:17.382 --> 25:19.350
with an Englishman
named Miles.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.351
You've been there
nearly three years.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.886
Who or what you did
before that

25:22.954 --> 25:24.387
seems to be
a real mystery.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.648
Probably not
the kind of things

25:26.725 --> 25:29.159
you can discuss
at your fancy fundraisers.

25:29.227 --> 25:31.161
I'm working on
the blank spots, too.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.355
Speaking of blank spots,

25:32.430 --> 25:34.159
we got a warehouse
full of gold here,

25:34.232 --> 25:37.292
we got a lawyer named
Abrahms who was killed,

25:37.402 --> 25:40.132
we got something called "Boca
Culebra" he stumbled onto,

25:40.238 --> 25:41.796
all parts of
a big jigsaw puzzle.

25:41.907 --> 25:42.999
Now, I'm telling you,

25:43.108 --> 25:45.042
we can help
each other out here.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.907
Thanks.
Maybe some other time.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.317
Michael, the
authorities are on their way.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.285
Joanna?

26:39.864 --> 26:41.354
Joanna, it's me, Michael.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.331
Joanna...

26:45.670 --> 26:47.001
What are you doing here?

26:47.072 --> 26:48.471
I could ask you
the same question.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.440
Yeah, you could,
but I still want an answer.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.237
You know Joanna?

26:52.844 --> 26:54.243
From where?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.674
Uh, DC.

26:55.747 --> 26:57.772
Her old man and I
used to play racquetball.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.010
Terrific lawyer,
lousy backhand.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.045
Michael,
how did you get in my room?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.253
Who are you?

27:05.323 --> 27:08.383
He says he used to play
racquetball with your husband.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.758
Arthur never
played racquetball.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.798
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

27:13.865 --> 27:15.560
Among other things,
trying to find out

27:15.634 --> 27:17.158
who killed your husband
and why.

27:17.268 --> 27:18.735
His name is David Dalton.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.304
He saved my neck
this morning.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.339
That's very nice,

27:21.439 --> 27:23.669
but that doesn't explain
what he's doing in my room.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.369
Or why you
lied to me.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.172
I think you owe me
an explanation.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.236
And I think you'd be
better off back at DC

27:29.314 --> 27:31.407
at one of your society
luncheons or bridge games.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.541
For your information,

27:32.617 --> 27:34.915
the only society luncheons
I attend are for charity.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.511
And I haven't
played bridge in years.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.583
Why am I
explaining myself to him?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.421
She gets more coverage
than the Redskins.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.517
Time out.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.085
Come on, we're all
after the same thing here.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.222
I'm not
so sure that's true.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.163
All right, you say
you're trying to find out

27:49.267 --> 27:51.098
who killed my husband.
Why?

27:51.202 --> 27:52.328
Let me put it
this way.

27:52.437 --> 27:53.927
I think I know
who killed him.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.506
Really? Who?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.835
A man named
Eduardo O'Brian.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.604
Then why don't you call the
police and have him arrested?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.544
If I could get
what I need, I would.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.275
What exactly
is it you need?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.384
More information. Proof.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.112
And how do you
intend to get it?

28:08.453 --> 28:09.715
That's the hard part.

28:09.788 --> 28:11.756
Eduardo Brian travels
in very select circles.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.882
He's not
easy to get to.

28:14.225 --> 28:16.420
Maybe you just don't know
the right people.

28:17.062 --> 28:18.393
And I suppose
you do.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.358
Perhaps.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.832
Joanna, David's been
on this for a while.

28:23.935 --> 28:26.233
He might know
more than we do.

28:26.337 --> 28:29.795
If we need to get to Eduardo,
she might be able to help us.

28:29.908 --> 28:32.103
I don't think they travel
in the same circles.

28:32.177 --> 28:33.474
Don't be so sure.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.172
Who's O'Brian's contact
in the States?

28:35.246 --> 28:37.009
A businessman
named Elton Matthews.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.549
He owns a
construction firm in LA.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.413
Ring any
social bells?

28:40.485 --> 28:44.785
Not right off the bat.
But meet me in Los Angeles,

28:45.390 --> 28:47.722
I might be able
to turn up some.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.644
There's another rig
running the scales.

29:06.711 --> 29:08.372
See you later, Sam.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.746
Eduardo O'Brian's been
one of the biggest independents

30:21.820 --> 30:23.481
in Mexican crime for years.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.920
The stories about
what he's done

30:24.989 --> 30:27.321
to people he doesn't like
would turn your stomach.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.950
He's got this thing
for weapons.

30:29.027 --> 30:30.824
Uh, they say he's
one of the best.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.693
You know, there was a small
fortune in gold on that truck.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.790
Any idea where
that fits in?

30:35.867 --> 30:38.358
He's been smuggling
a lot of it across the border.

30:38.469 --> 30:39.493
Once it's in the States,

30:39.604 --> 30:41.595
he turns it into cash
as fast as possible.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.264
That's all we know so far.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.898
Another piece
in the puzzle, huh?

30:45.009 --> 30:46.670
It's turning out
to be a big puzzle.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.336
You'd be surprised how big.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.402
Six months ago,

30:49.480 --> 30:51.710
O'Brian got hold of some
stolen DOD documents.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.479
The guy who sold them ended up
floating in the Potomac River

30:54.552 --> 30:56.816
before anyone could figure out
what they were.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.321
An agent was put on the case.

30:58.389 --> 30:59.879
He got as far
as the combination

30:59.958 --> 31:02.859
to a safe on O'Brian's yacht
when they found him.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.158
Someone had used an African
skinning knife on him.

31:06.564 --> 31:09.692
It took the coroner three days
to ID the poor guy.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.827
They figured it took him
48 hours to die.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.332
By the time
I got to the safe,

31:15.440 --> 31:16.907
they'd changed
the combination.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.635
That's the way
it's been with O'Brian.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.268
Just when you think
you've got a lead,

31:20.345 --> 31:21.835
you come up empty-handed.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.811
Maybe Joanna will
change your luck.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.281
Don't hold
your breath.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.944
You don't just walk into town,
make a few phone calls,

31:28.019 --> 31:30.510
and get invited to dinner
with Eduardo O'Brian.

31:30.588 --> 31:31.953
So the party's tonight.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.650
At Elton Matthews'
beach house.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.852
Uh, tonight.
Just like that?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.394
Well, Priscella Ragsdale
and I

31:37.462 --> 31:39.191
were neighbors for years
in Georgetown

31:39.264 --> 31:41.698
before she and John
moved here to Los Angeles.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.393
And, uh, he's
an entertainment lawyer,

31:43.501 --> 31:45.025
so, of course,
they know everybody.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.104
Sounds like
a fantastic opportunity.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.502
It's a start.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.131
Now let me think
how we can use this.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.038
You won't have to
worry about using this.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.941
You're not invited. I am.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.038
Besides, it's black tie,
so I don't think you'd fit in.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.519
Would you mind not staring
at the cookies like that?

32:02.587 --> 32:03.781
Poison.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.948
They happen to be
English butter biscuits.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.616
Yeah, and stuffed
with preservatives,

32:07.692 --> 32:10.388
artificial flavors,
artificial colors, additives...

32:10.461 --> 32:12.895
They've been eating them
in England for five centuries.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.159
Right, and look what
happened to the empire.

32:17.068 --> 32:18.126
All right.

32:18.236 --> 32:21.034
What do you think are O'Brian's
chances of being at the party?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.504
Very good.
Terrible.

32:22.573 --> 32:23.938
O'Brian's in Mexico.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.066
Was.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.076
This happens to be
a birthday party for him.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.169
Really?

32:28.246 --> 32:29.270
Let's take a drive.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.780
There's something
I wanna show you.

32:30.848 --> 32:32.145
Okay.

32:32.717 --> 32:33.877
Michael?

32:34.118 --> 32:35.585
I need an escort
for tonight.

32:35.653 --> 32:36.711
You got one.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.346
Thanks. 8:30? 7:30.

32:38.423 --> 32:40.015
7:30. Okay, bye.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.485
This place is also

32:41.559 --> 32:43.288
part of Matthews'
construction business.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.885
Two nights ago,
I saw a whole caravan

32:44.963 --> 32:46.624
of dump trucks
leave here empty.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.666
Six hours later
they returned full.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.200
In the middle
of the night?

32:50.301 --> 32:51.563
That's pretty strange.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.035
Yeah, especially since
Matthews doesn't have a job

32:54.105 --> 32:56.471
anywhere in this part
of the state right now.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.145
Wait a minute.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.822
These boxes
look real familiar.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.906
These things are big enough
to knock a house down.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.118
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!

34:34.105 --> 34:37.302
I'd sure like to know
where those rockets are going.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.375
Hmm.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.516
Right on time, Michael.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.683
Michael got busy.
I'm your date.

34:54.525 --> 34:57.551
But that's impossible.
It's black tie.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.357
I know, but I didn't think
black would go

34:59.430 --> 35:00.658
with this sports coat.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.194
Yes, may I have
the valet, please?

35:16.681 --> 35:19.149
Michael, my research
indicates that those rockets

35:19.217 --> 35:22.550
are capable of piercing
four-inch reinforced steel.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.315
You sound a little
nervous there, buddy.

35:24.388 --> 35:25.946
Nervous? Certainly not.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.923
But the thought of
what a weapon like that

35:27.992 --> 35:30.051
might do to me
is rather perplexing.

35:30.561 --> 35:34.156
Yeah, well, let's make a
point of not finding out, huh?

35:37.768 --> 35:39.360
I'll bet they developed
these things

35:39.470 --> 35:40.869
during the Inquisition.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.069
The rack and the tux.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.169
I just realized

35:45.243 --> 35:48.007
I have absolutely no idea
what we're planning to do.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.910
We're not
planning anything.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.175
You're going to circulate

35:51.249 --> 35:53.274
and make
charming conversation.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.252
Somehow, I'm going to get
into Matthews' study upstairs.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.947
There must be
something I can do.

35:58.022 --> 36:01.480
Just do whatever the right
people do at parties like these.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.063
Thank you.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.170
Oh, the Ragsdales.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.037
Oh, right. John and Prissy.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.304
Oh, well, hi!

36:20.378 --> 36:21.538
Joanna!

36:21.612 --> 36:22.772
How are you?

36:22.847 --> 36:23.973
It's so
good to see you.

36:24.048 --> 36:25.208
You look wonderful.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.615
Thank you.
This is David Dalton.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.313
Oh.

36:29.387 --> 36:30.786
How long are you
in town?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.254
Oh, I'm not
really sure.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.086
It depends on
so many things.

36:34.158 --> 36:35.955
It's great
having you here.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.126
Oh, look at that!

36:41.832 --> 36:45.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I please have your attention?

36:45.803 --> 36:47.498
Welcome to the party.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.574
It's time to present our
guest of honor this evening,

36:50.641 --> 36:52.165
Eduardo O'Brian.

36:52.276 --> 36:53.334
Oh, my.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.504
... recognition
of Eduardo's birthday...

36:55.580 --> 36:58.208
Oh, don't be so
19th century, John.

36:58.282 --> 37:01.217
What's she supposed to do?
Dry up and blow away?

37:01.319 --> 37:02.479
Priscella,

37:02.520 --> 37:04.511
Arthur's been dead
less than a week.

37:04.589 --> 37:05.817
Six days.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.051
... your enthusiasm
and your hospitality.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.820
Not a bad week's work.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.124
It's been said a
man's wealth is determined

37:12.196 --> 37:14.221
by the number
of friends he has.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.630
But frankly,
I prefer the money.

37:18.536 --> 37:20.504
Thank you for being here
this evening with me.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.629
Thank you.

38:30.341 --> 38:32.605
Introduce me to
that beautiful woman.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.475
Would you like
some champagne?

38:35.546 --> 38:37.343
Thanks,
but I don't drink.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.161
Oh, you must be the host
of this fabulous party.

38:55.232 --> 38:56.529
Elton Matthews.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.662
I'm delighted
to meet you, Miss...

38:58.836 --> 39:00.326
Joanna St. John.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.439
You know, I was just admiring
some of these pre-Columbian pieces.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.372
They are so exquisite.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.001
Are you
a collector?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.705
Oh, of sorts.

39:08.779 --> 39:09.837
Mister?

39:09.914 --> 39:11.905
O'Brian.
Eduardo O'Brian.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.777
Maybe I could show
you some of my favorites.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.980
I'd like that
very much, Mr. O'Brian.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.989
Please call me Eduardo.

39:22.426 --> 39:23.757
Excuse me.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.410
You and Joanna are
such a striking couple.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.473
Have you known
each other long?

39:46.550 --> 39:49.178
Not really.
Actually it seems like hours.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.346
I know what you mean.

39:51.422 --> 39:52.980
At least I used to.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.821
Before John's clock
started to slow down.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.329
I'll bet yours
doesn't miss a beat.

40:00.297 --> 40:01.821
Excuse me.

40:16.180 --> 40:17.772
The men's room?

41:10.768 --> 41:13.464
Looks like they're moving
the rockets to the semi.

41:13.571 --> 41:15.436
Let's take a look
inside, huh, pal?

41:20.778 --> 41:22.803
The x-ray mode
won't penetrate, Michael.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.178
The trailer's
lined with lead.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.120
All right.
Looks like they're leaving.

43:52.029 --> 43:54.520
Mr. Matthews has
the most beautiful home.

43:54.598 --> 43:56.828
And you are
the perfect complement to it.

43:57.501 --> 43:58.968
Thank you.

43:59.069 --> 44:01.037
So is the lovely woman
you're with.

44:01.138 --> 44:04.301
Tiara?
Yes, she's beautiful.

44:05.042 --> 44:07.943
She's like champagne.
Good for the parties.

44:08.345 --> 44:11.781
You, on the other hand, are
like a deep, rich Burgundy.

44:12.516 --> 44:13.915
Well, metaphors aside,

44:13.984 --> 44:16.612
I can't imagine
how a man such as yourself

44:16.687 --> 44:18.780
could ever want
for anything.

44:18.856 --> 44:20.346
Including a woman.

44:20.457 --> 44:22.084
I rarely am.

44:22.726 --> 44:26.526
When I see something I want,
I pursue it until it's mine.

44:28.766 --> 44:31.166
Oh, it's awfully cold.

44:31.268 --> 44:32.735
Shall we?

44:32.836 --> 44:34.303
As you wish.

44:34.972 --> 44:37.406
But I'm reluctant
to share your company

44:37.474 --> 44:38.907
with even one more person.

44:38.976 --> 44:41.774
Perhaps you could be
my guest sometime

44:41.845 --> 44:43.676
in less
crowded circumstances.

44:43.747 --> 44:45.237
Yes, perhaps.

45:14.278 --> 45:15.677
Thank you.

45:16.413 --> 45:17.778
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:20.617 --> 45:22.778
Get out of here,
you idiot!

45:22.953 --> 45:24.250
Are you all right?

45:24.321 --> 45:26.152
Eduardo,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.191
It was really
all my fault. I'm sorry.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.868
Eduardo, there's been a
little disturbance upstairs.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.274
All of the guests
are accounted for

45:44.374 --> 45:46.433
except for
Miss St. John's friend.

45:46.610 --> 45:47.634
David?

45:47.711 --> 45:49.178
You called?

45:50.881 --> 45:51.905
Cheers.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.440
I thought
you didn't drink.

45:54.518 --> 45:55.951
Only on
special occasions.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.680
Shall we?
Excuse me.

45:58.789 --> 46:00.222
Is there a problem?

46:00.324 --> 46:03.816
Well, Eduardo's
invited me to have a nightcap.

46:03.861 --> 46:06.728
Huh. In that case,
I'll see you later.

46:28.585 --> 46:30.780
Michael, this
is becoming a career.

46:30.854 --> 46:31.912
What?

46:31.989 --> 46:32.978
That was a joke.

46:33.056 --> 46:34.250
Oh.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.458
I guess my sense
of humor needs a tune-up.

46:38.729 --> 46:40.492
That was a joke.

46:40.564 --> 46:41.656
Oh.

46:41.732 --> 46:43.097
Hang in there, buddy.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.600
They can't run forever.

46:44.701 --> 46:46.464
I certainly hope not.

46:54.545 --> 46:57.810
Sorry.
Didn't mean to wake you.

46:58.615 --> 47:00.549
Do you always
sleep this late?

47:00.651 --> 47:01.777
Day's half over.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.878
What are you doing?
What is this thing doing

47:03.954 --> 47:05.819
in the middle
of my living room?

47:05.889 --> 47:07.186
I'm moving in.

47:07.357 --> 47:10.258
I tried to get another room,
but they're all booked.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.954
Where's the kitchen?
I grow sprouts

47:12.029 --> 47:13.553
and they prefer
a southern exposure.

47:13.630 --> 47:15.655
Are you crazy?
Would you get out of here?

47:15.732 --> 47:17.063
Get out of here
right now!

47:17.167 --> 47:18.065
I can't.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.135
You can.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.137
Not without blowing
everything we've done.

47:21.305 --> 47:22.795
They think we're lovers.

47:22.906 --> 47:25.033
How's it gonna look,
you living here in luxury

47:25.108 --> 47:27.941
and me living like a dog at the
Tri-Way Motel for $12 a night?

47:28.011 --> 47:30.707
They think we're lovers?
Who thinks we're lovers?

47:30.781 --> 47:32.908
Your friends.
Priscella in particular.

47:33.150 --> 47:34.913
They were saying things like:

47:34.985 --> 47:38.216
"I hear you and Joanna
are quite close. "

47:38.288 --> 47:39.949
"How long have you
two been together?"

47:40.023 --> 47:41.115
Well, what could I say?

47:41.191 --> 47:42.283
What did you say?

47:42.359 --> 47:44.452
I said you were
a wonderful woman and...

47:44.528 --> 47:45.620
And what?

47:45.696 --> 47:48.096
I don't know.
Women smiled. Men winked.

47:48.165 --> 47:49.257
Oh.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.028
Look, if this is
difficult for you...

47:51.134 --> 47:53.329
Oh, It's not difficult,
it's unacceptable.

47:53.437 --> 47:54.904
I've always
hated that word.

47:54.972 --> 47:57.532
I think you and I'd better
get a few things straight.

47:57.641 --> 48:00.075
First of all, I'm here
to conduct an investigation,

48:00.177 --> 48:02.236
not play social doormat
and empty-glass holder

48:02.312 --> 48:04.473
for you and your highbrow,
low-minded friends.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.981
Second,
I've got my own life.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.677
I don't need to push
my way into other people's.

48:12.789 --> 48:13.949
Look,

48:14.825 --> 48:17.487
I'm sorry.
I... I just thought...

48:18.362 --> 48:20.762
Well, I don't know
what I thought.

48:20.964 --> 48:22.955
This is all so new
to me.

48:24.001 --> 48:26.401
I'm not exactly
a veteran myself.

48:27.437 --> 48:28.529
I've got an idea.

48:28.639 --> 48:29.663
Me, too.

48:29.773 --> 48:32.241
I could leave a few things
here for appearance's sake.

48:32.342 --> 48:33.866
What's your idea?

48:33.977 --> 48:35.706
You could leave
a few things here

48:35.779 --> 48:37.679
for appearance's sake.

48:40.284 --> 48:42.514
A shame to let
a spare bedroom go to waste.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.575
Uh...

48:43.654 --> 48:45.952
Just kidding. Just kidding.

48:46.990 --> 48:49.550
You and O'Brian seemed to
hit if off last night.

48:49.626 --> 48:51.116
We speak the same language.

48:51.194 --> 48:52.627
It figures.

48:53.330 --> 48:54.627
Well, while you two

48:54.698 --> 48:57.189
were exchanging
social pleasantries,

48:57.901 --> 49:01.302
I found something incredible.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.303
Incredible.

49:03.373 --> 49:05.671
I copied this list off
of Matthews' computer.

49:05.742 --> 49:06.766
It's from the Boca file.

49:06.877 --> 49:08.139
As in Boca Culebra?

49:08.211 --> 49:09.200
Mmm-hmm.

49:10.147 --> 49:12.240
What do these numbers
and letters mean?

49:12.316 --> 49:14.375
I don't know,
but I'm almost positive

49:14.451 --> 49:16.646
there's some classified papers
that could tell us.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.449
And where are they?

49:18.522 --> 49:20.456
I'm almost positive
they're locked in a safe

49:20.524 --> 49:21.718
on O'Brian's yacht.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.818
Which is a lot like
being locked in Fort Knox.

49:25.595 --> 49:29.053
Well, even Fort Knox opens
with the right combination.

49:29.533 --> 49:31.228
Sure.
What are you going to do,

49:31.335 --> 49:33.769
make another call
and ask Eduardo for it?

49:35.539 --> 49:36.972
Not exactly.

49:40.243 --> 49:41.904
You know, you're right, buddy.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.241
This is becoming a career.

49:43.313 --> 49:45.907
I think it's time
to force their hand.

50:04.768 --> 50:07.794
Michael, that's a
4.7-mm rocket launcher.

50:07.904 --> 50:09.394
I got you, pal.

50:32.996 --> 50:35.464
Michael, that rocket
still has us in its sights.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.261
Then we're gonna have to
outrun him, pal.

50:37.367 --> 50:38.561
Hit it!

50:53.083 --> 50:54.675
We're onto a fortune in gold,

50:54.751 --> 50:56.651
a rocket launcher
hidden inside a semi,

50:56.720 --> 50:57.982
and Eduardo O'Brian.

50:58.055 --> 50:59.283
This thing's like an octopus.

50:59.356 --> 51:01.347
Every time we turn around,
there's a new tentacle.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.016
Maybe you shouldn't have
let her go.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.357
I tried to
talk her out of it.

51:04.428 --> 51:06.692
She said it was her
constitutional right or something.

51:06.763 --> 51:07.923
How long
have they been gone?

51:07.998 --> 51:10.023
What? Oh, about an hour.

51:11.001 --> 51:12.491
Look, it's her life, right?

51:12.602 --> 51:14.627
I just hope she doesn't blow
everything sky high.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.535
I'm gonna go check out
those dump trucks

51:16.606 --> 51:18.471
you mentioned.
Do you wanna come?

51:18.542 --> 51:20.806
Uh, no. I'd better
stick around, just in case.

51:20.877 --> 51:22.970
Yeah, right.
Just in case.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.280
I know so little about you.

52:06.990 --> 52:09.515
Well, no less than
I know about you.

52:10.894 --> 52:13.920
You seem a study
in contrasts, you know.

52:14.664 --> 52:16.996
Even your name,
Eduardo O'Brian.

52:17.334 --> 52:19.097
Are you Mexican or Irish?

52:19.202 --> 52:20.191
Both.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.396
My mother was Mexican,
my father was Irish.

52:22.506 --> 52:23.473
Uh-huh.

52:23.573 --> 52:26.872
They had two things in common,
Catholicism and sex.

52:27.244 --> 52:29.007
Neither was enough.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.104
Sorry.

52:31.181 --> 52:32.910
Oh, never be sorry.

52:34.251 --> 52:36.276
People get together,
they share,

52:36.353 --> 52:38.583
they learn,
and then they part.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.953
Life is like, uh, like water.

52:41.024 --> 52:43.390
If it stays too long
in one place, it goes bad.

52:43.460 --> 52:45.519
I sense
that you know that.

52:45.595 --> 52:48.063
Oh, you've very intuitive.
So am I.

52:48.131 --> 52:49.155
Yes?

52:49.232 --> 52:50.358
Yes.

52:51.801 --> 52:53.632
What do you sense in me?

52:53.737 --> 52:55.466
Oh, let's see. Um...

52:56.907 --> 52:59.432
You pride yourself
on your skill with weapons,

52:59.543 --> 53:01.272
and you're a gambler.

53:02.145 --> 53:04.375
You can't resist
a challenge.

53:05.649 --> 53:06.877
You are very intuitive.

53:06.950 --> 53:08.076
And logical.

53:08.151 --> 53:09.948
And logic tells me,

53:10.187 --> 53:11.654
that if I were
to challenge you

53:11.721 --> 53:13.985
to a trapshoot at,
say, uh,

53:14.491 --> 53:16.959
$1,000 a pigeon,

53:18.862 --> 53:20.659
you couldn't say no.

53:39.849 --> 53:41.476
Get Mr. Matthews.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.190
Hey, you shoot well.

53:48.258 --> 53:49.919
Family tradition.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.189
Pull.

54:00.337 --> 54:01.861
Mr. O'Brian?

54:02.606 --> 54:05.973
Mr. Matthews is on the phone.
He says it's important.

54:06.276 --> 54:07.641
Thank you.

54:08.511 --> 54:09.569
Excuse me.

54:09.646 --> 54:10.670
Yes.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.160
Yes?

54:34.904 --> 54:36.269
Destroy it.

54:36.873 --> 54:38.636
And check
the rest of the house,

54:38.708 --> 54:40.369
every inch of it.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.712
I want a full report
when I return.

54:48.251 --> 54:49.445
Pull!

54:54.691 --> 54:56.090
Incredible.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.753
I've never missed
seven in a row.

54:58.828 --> 55:00.056
Eight.

55:00.630 --> 55:01.790
Eight.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.358
Eight.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.866
Yes. Of course.

55:05.969 --> 55:06.958
Well...

55:08.204 --> 55:09.694
A bet is a bet.

55:11.975 --> 55:12.942
Excuse me.

55:13.043 --> 55:14.533
Yes. Of course.

55:57.921 --> 55:59.354
You told him what?

55:59.422 --> 56:00.480
I had no choice.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.683
Yeah, but everything
you said was a lie.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.422
What did you want me to do,
tell him the truth?

56:05.495 --> 56:06.519
Um, no.

56:06.596 --> 56:09.326
Well, exactly.
You can't have it both ways.

56:09.399 --> 56:10.923
What if he decides to check?

56:11.034 --> 56:12.899
I'm convinced he will.

56:13.803 --> 56:15.168
We're dead.

56:15.605 --> 56:17.095
Not necessarily.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.402
I had a nice little chat
with Priscella.

56:19.476 --> 56:20.738
She's going to cover for me.

56:20.810 --> 56:22.334
I should've never let you go.

56:22.412 --> 56:23.743
You had nothing
to do with it.

56:23.813 --> 56:24.871
I went on my own.

56:24.948 --> 56:26.040
That's what I mean.

56:26.116 --> 56:27.947
Joanna, a man
like Eduardo O'Brian

56:28.017 --> 56:30.451
isn't limited to checking
with personal friends.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.385
Well, you're
the professional.

56:32.455 --> 56:34.889
You told me you had ways
to take care of things.

56:34.958 --> 56:36.892
Things, yeah.
But a whole life

56:36.960 --> 56:39.451
invented over crab legs
and skeet shooting.

56:39.529 --> 56:41.759
Why did you have to tell him
a Caribbean island?

56:41.831 --> 56:42.991
You have to talk louder.

56:43.066 --> 56:45.557
I said, why did you have
to tell him you were married

56:45.668 --> 56:47.863
to a treasure hunter
on a Caribbean island?

56:47.971 --> 56:49.768
Would it
have made it any easier

56:49.839 --> 56:52.307
if I'd said a shoe salesman
in Des Moines?

56:53.810 --> 56:55.243
I guess not.

56:56.012 --> 56:57.377
Thank you.

56:58.281 --> 57:00.909
Listen, Archibald,
I need a little help.

57:01.050 --> 57:02.711
You know that woman
I mentioned?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.979
No, no, no, not that one.

57:06.189 --> 57:08.953
The one that got me
into Elton Matthews' study.

57:09.492 --> 57:11.153
Yeah, well,
it's a long story,

57:11.227 --> 57:13.627
but Eduardo O'Brian
cornered her about her past.

57:13.696 --> 57:15.391
She did the only thing
she could.

57:15.465 --> 57:16.557
She lied.

57:16.633 --> 57:19.625
I may need you to cover it,
in case he checks.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.601
I know, I know, I know,
it's a lot to ask,

57:21.671 --> 57:23.832
but we've got
no other choice.

57:24.707 --> 57:27.107
Thanks. Thanks,
I appreciate it.

57:27.177 --> 57:28.405
H-hold on a minute.

57:29.913 --> 57:31.346
There's more?

57:31.414 --> 57:33.211
It was a long lunch.

57:36.886 --> 57:40.049
Arch, you may need
a pencil.

57:41.090 --> 57:43.752
First of all,
she's been married twice.

57:43.927 --> 57:45.451
Once to a treasure hunter,

57:45.528 --> 57:47.996
and once to a South African
diamond dealer.

57:48.064 --> 57:49.998
What? You can't do that...

57:50.300 --> 57:51.927
What's he saying?

57:52.135 --> 57:53.932
You don't wanna know.

57:54.737 --> 57:55.795
Well,

57:55.905 --> 57:58.703
uh, maybe this will help
soothe the pain.

58:01.344 --> 58:03.505
What's this,
your dress size?

58:04.280 --> 58:06.805
The combination
to the yacht's safe.

58:38.448 --> 58:40.939
Michael, what if
this is a wild goose chase?

58:41.017 --> 58:43.008
If David's right, it won't be.

58:43.086 --> 58:44.815
KITT, the dump trucks fit in.

58:44.888 --> 58:46.753
We just don't know how yet.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.440
Hey!

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.813
How's it going?

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.759
Hey, Charlie,

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.990
when's this thing
gonna be finished?

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.554
Don't ask me.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:20.090
At $500 a load,
I hope they dig to China.

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.197
They're the same numbers

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.632
I saw on the computer
in Elton Matthews' study.

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.933
M-19X, LGMS-Series X.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.738
According to these specs,
the LGMS-Series X

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.174
is a laser-guided
missile system

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.973
that's adaptable to
a conventional assault rifle.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.446
Yeah.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.042
Where?

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:08.882
What time?

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.886
Arch, the 19th is tomorrow.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.956
Yeah, okay.

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:16.748
Mmm-hmm. Bye.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.285
Well? What did he say?

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.888
He said these weapons
don't exist.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:26.334
At least not officially.
Come on.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.902
So did he say
anything else?

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.498
Yeah. Elton Matthews
just bought a plane.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:36.908
A C-141. One of the biggest
cargo planes ever built.

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.740
$18 million cash.

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.350
David, could that be
what the gold was used for?

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.682
Probably.
The mystery unfolds.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.154
The kicker is
a flight plan's been filed.

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.781
It leaves from
a private airfield

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.258
outside Dallas
at 1:00 p. m. tomorrow.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.190
Does that mean
that Boca Culebra

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:55.924
happens tomorrow afternoon?

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.761
That's Arch's guess.

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.325
What's yours?

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:02.063
Boca Culebra happens
tomorrow afternoon.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:10.342
David, what exactly is it
that he expects you to do?

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.005
Find it first.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.712
Who is Archibald?

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:18.945
My boss.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.852
I know that.
But I mean, who is he?

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.720
Who does he work for?

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.718
The Department of Justice.

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.055
Wow.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:32.332
Well, I never imagined you
as a government employee.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:34.733
A Fed, huh?

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.396
I'm not. Not officially.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.440
Oh, you sound
like the guns.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.669
So what are you,
officially?

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.374
Just a guy who shows up
here and there.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.820
What's the Department of
Justice's interest in this?

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.446
Eduardo O'Brian.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.786
He usually operates
outside the country.

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.723
This time,
he's here in the flesh.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.454
Archibald sees it as,
quote,

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:01.792
"A rare and unique
opportunity. "

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.525
And how do you see it?

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.931
It's a long story.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:07.525
Well, I don't have
a plane to catch.

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:09.868
You do it for the money?

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:10.963
No.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.370
Uh, love of country?

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.601
No.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:15.702
I know.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.076
You're trying to forget
a tragic love affair.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.473
I got into a little trouble
in Guatemala.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.709
It's a long story.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.649
Come on, David.
You keep saying that.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.516
Just give me
the Reader's Digest version.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.556
I don't think
they'd be interested.

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.250
You're being coy.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.617
I just don't want to talk
about it.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.392
You were in prison.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.235
Did Archibald
get you out?

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:42.167
Is that why you do it?

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.206
What did you do,
run a jacket on me?

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.262
No.

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.433
People just don't guess
things like that.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.306
You'd be surprised.

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.543
He wanted someone to kick off
a pet project of his,

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.173
and I wanted
out of Guatemala.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.445
We made a deal,
and here I am.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:00.879
Did you love him?

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:02.048
What?

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:04.355
Your husband,
did you love him?

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.852
Yes.
Of course I loved him.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.120
Why?

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.687
He's only been dead a week.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.232
Eight days.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.729
Why do you want to know
if I loved him?

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.806
You asked that question
for a reason.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.341
What are you trying to say?

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:21.876
Forget it.
It's none of my business.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.946
You're damn right
it's none of your business,

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.480
but that's not the point.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.581
What did you mean?

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.312
All I meant was
it must've been hard for you.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.544
What?

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.178
Looking into the eyes
of the man

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.780
who killed your husband
and smiling.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.652
Oh.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.930
Here you go.
If she says yes,

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:17.761
you're invited
to the wedding.

01:08:56.698 --> 01:08:58.166
What are you doing here?

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.962
Waiting for Joanna.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.625
She's not here?

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.328
If she were,
I wouldn't be waiting.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.304
If she's not here,
how did you get in here?

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.069
The door was ajar.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.643
Please,
give these to her for me.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.042
They die quickly
without water.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.809
You believe in keeping fit.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:17.578
The body's a tool.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.383
A tool or a weapon?

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:23.823
I'll tell Joanna
you brought by the flowers.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:27.554
As magnificent a weapon
as the body can be,

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.825
it is limited
by its design.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.328
A finely designed weapon,
however, has no limits.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:37.296
I'll remember that.
Thanks for dropping by.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.640
Joanna is an extraordinary
woman in so many ways.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:43.473
And you seem anything
but extraordinary.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.941
I can't imagine
what she sees in you.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.140
Real mystery.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.274
Pardon?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.147
Human relationships.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:53.278
You hide behind
your woman's skirts.

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:56.591
Someday, when she's
not around to protect you,

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:57.921
we'll meet again.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:00.785
You may be a big man
to people that are impressed

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.330
by yachts and young girls.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:04.059
That doesn't include me.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.430
And one more thing.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:07.729
I don't hide behind
Joanna's skirts,

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.327
and I'm not hard to find.
So if you ever want me,

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.963
I'm right here.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:23.108
Boca Culebra
is a perfect description.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.380
The mouth looks like
an abandoned mineshaft,

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.183
a hole where the dirt
comes out.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.881
The snake
is an underground tunnel

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:31.722
dug by forced labor.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.828
The illegal aliens
you saw at the border.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.557
Yeah. That's my guess.

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:37.223
It doesn't make sense.

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.823
A tunnel to where?
To what?

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:41.769
I don't know, David.
All I could see was desert.

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.498
I've got Devon
checking on it.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.630
Anything on the weapons?

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.798
No, not yet.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.170
All we know for sure

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:50.076
is that the C-141
leaves Dallas at 1:00 today.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.045
Figure it's about
a two-hour flight,

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:53.240
so whatever's gonna happen

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:55.044
is gonna happen
in less than six hours.

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:56.744
Doesn't give us much time.

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:12.396
Eight shots in a row.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.760
I should have known then.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.497
Maybe we can
postpone it.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.629
No.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.399
Eduardo,
they're onto us!

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.745
A little information
is like a little power.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.178
You always want more.

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:32.051
Uh, Joanna just came
in. I'll get back to you.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.748
How was shopping?
Oh, it was fun.

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.653
It took my mind off
everything for a while.

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.021
I picked up
some things for you.

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:38.218
For me? What?

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.159
Oh, just a few things.

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:45.100
Oh, David,
they're beautiful.

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:47.532
Thank you.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.603
Actually...

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.367
Actually, you are
a very special person.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.033
I misjudged you.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:56.704
David.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.776
Thanks so much
for last night,

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:01.145
I hadn't been able to cry,
I couldn't.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.775
I didn't know how badly
I needed to.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.780
What's wrong?

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.186
Uh, nothing.

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.555
No, something's wrong,
I can tell. What is it?

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.025
We're running out of time.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.823
I've got to get back
in the beach house,

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.488
get to that computer
in the study.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:18.226
It's our last chance to figure
out Boca before it's too late.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.461
David, you don't know
anything about computers.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.332
No, but Michael does.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.030
If I can get back
in the study,

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:27.108
I can get the computer to interface
with the computer in Michael's car.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.904
I don't know how it works,
but everything

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:30.968
in their computer
will be transferred to KITT.

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:33.446
David, is there something
you want me to do?

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.982
No.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.010
I'll call him.
It's all right.

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.312
Who?

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.617
Eduardo.

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:44.088
You would like me
to call him, wouldn't you?

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.649
Eduardo
was here earlier.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:48.322
He's suspicious.
It could be dangerous.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.490
I know. I figured that out.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.268
I haven't figured you out,
though.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:57.037
Every time I touch you,
you flinch.

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.664
Habit, I guess.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.143
You know, David,
I don't wanna pry,

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.442
but you helped me
last night.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.678
Maybe I could help you.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.479
I don't know
anything about you.

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:13.214
I don't... I don't know how your
life was like, or how you grew up.

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:15.654
I know it was hard,
I know that.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.457
You know, David, whatever
happened is in the past.

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.521
It's... it's over.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.901
I wish you'd trust me
a little bit.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.198
You don't have to
keep fighting wars

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.135
that ended years ago.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.772
Hello.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:42.050
Yes. Yes, I was just
gonna call you, Eduardo.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:53.787
All set?

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:54.954
We're ready when you are.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.964
All right. Let's do it.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.054
Joanna.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.324
Eduardo.

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.988
You look
more beautiful than ever.

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.397
Thank you.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.999
I trust the flowers
please you?

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.536
The flowers?

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.669
Oh, the flowers. Oh, Eduardo,
they're beautiful.

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:42.107
Thank you.

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:44.677
David was kind enough
to put them in a vase for me.

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:47.306
Yes. I imagine he's good
at that sort of thing.

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.213
Will you join me
on the terrace?

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.514
I'd love to, but, uh, can
I use the powder room first?

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.179
Yes, it's the first door
to the right.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.517
Thank you.

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.962
Michael, it's 1:27.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.462
Thanks, pal.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:03.590
Two more minutes,

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.758
and David should be
inside the grounds.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.928
Once he's inside, he'll be
out of scanner range.

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:10.364
I know.

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:47.397
There you are.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.874
Ah, thank you.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.837
A fascinating weapon,
the boomerang.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:54.875
Are you familiar with it?

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.008
No.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.983
It was developed by the
aborigines in Australia,

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:02.488
centuries before
the English came.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.686
They called it baja dara,
stick of life.

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.400
Don't be frightened.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.466
Baja dara is what they say.

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.101
It's like life.

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:30.174
What you put out
will return to you.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.213
Freeze.

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.683
It's too bad
your bug didn't work.

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.388
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.931
Oh, I'm talking about
Boca Culebra.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.327
That must be
very frustrating.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:20.492
So close...

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:23.170
...and yet so far.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.706
What was that other word?
My Spanish isn't so good.

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:28.265
Compared to your cover,
I'm sure it's quite good.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.674
This way.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:36.517
Consider that
the final nail in your coffin.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.780
He did it!

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.119
He certainly did.

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.783
Okay, buddy,
let's see what we've got.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:52.860
Although the longbow
was credited

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.129
with changing
the face of war,

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.305
it was the introduction
of the crossbow

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:01.502
in the early 13th century
that truly revolutionized war.

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.672
It made killing efficient.

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.736
Eduardo,
did you invite me here

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:08.612
for a refresher course
on ancient weapons?

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:09.808
No.

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.712
This is why I invited you.

01:18:21.663 --> 01:18:23.893
KITT, run me the specs
on those weapons.

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:27.399
They're highly
classified prototypes, Michael.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.470
The most sophisticated
and lethal

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.529
conventional weapons
in the world today.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.131
Give me everything you can
find on the snake, the tunnel.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.039
Right away, Michael.

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.746
Here's Boca, the mouth.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.346
And here's the snake,
the tunnel.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:45.284
Michael, the tunnel leads to a
highly classified weapons depot.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.682
Bull's-eye!

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.424
So, as you
see, I know everything.

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:57.226
I even know you took credit
for the roses I sent Joanna.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.527
A small matter,

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.591
but added to your account
nevertheless.

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:03.603
But now the time has come
to pay the piper.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.207
How much time
do we have, Elton,

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.969
before the
helicopter arrives?

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.408
15 minutes.

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.204
I'll deal with you later.

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.215
But I'll deal with you now.
You have one minute.

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:22.355
You have a choice between
the beach and the wooded area.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.585
If I were you,
I'd choose the wooded area.

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.183
You have more cover.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.888
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.726
I'm talking about you.

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.265
Your life.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.260
If you wanna keep it,
you'd better start running.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.098
Eduardo, stop this.

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:39.503
If this is your idea
of a joke, it's in poor taste.

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:40.902
Elton?

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.771
50 seconds.

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:45.142
Run, David.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.345
Whoever you are,
can't you see

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.747
that this foolish game
of yours is over?

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.581
David, run!

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:12.903
Let's go!

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.983
KITT, what time is it?

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.577
Michael, what's wrong?

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.451
David should've been
back by now.

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.458
Maybe he found
more information.

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:34.256
I just hope he didn't find
more than he bargained for.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.316
What is it?

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.122
Where is he?

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.660
You've made
a fatal mistake, Tarzan!

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:53.305
This is not the jungle.
There are no vines here.

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.104
Easy to find you.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.946
I'll find you!

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:34.714
Eduardo, they're here.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.547
The helicopter is here!

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:42.689
Eduardo, it's not worth it!

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.456
You haven't won!

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.755
Do you hear me?

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.599
I'll have you
in my sights again!

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.380
Come on.

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.722
Tiara, where are you?
We're leaving!

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:51.257
Let's make one more pass.

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:57.122
Five more minutes
and I could've had him.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.029
It's okay.
It doesn't matter now.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.499
It matters.

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.895
That's it, KITT.
He's gotta be in trouble.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.598
Michael, you won't believe

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.175
what my scanner
just picked up.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.471
Look above you
at 11 o'clock.

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.012
Oh, no.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.941
Don't tell me that's David.

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.448
Who else?

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.738
Michael, how long
can he hang on like that?

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.603
I don't know, buddy.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.366
I just hope long enough.

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:22.231
Hurry up!

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:36.522
Let's go! Come
on, move it! Hurry up!

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.554
KITT, let me see
that Boca graphic again.

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:46.032
Now place
the chopper for me.

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:48.769
Now the semi.

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.906
Looks like a rendezvous.

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.868
What I don't see is David.

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.850
Look again, Michael.

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.692
All right! He made it!

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:18.755
I just hope
we're as fortunate.

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:19.891
What do you mean?

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.969
Coming up on your left.

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:23.930
There it is.

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:26.029
Mysterious Boca Culebra.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:28.970
Michael, I'm picking up
a large airplane on my sensor.

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.943
All right. Let's have a look.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.243
That could be the C-141
David mentioned.

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.778
Can you ID it?

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:38.250
It is a C-141.

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.786
All right. Get me Devon.

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.402
You got the target
locked in?

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:04.104
No problem, sir.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.675
Michael, why
haven't you kept in touch?

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.811
No time to explain now, Devon.

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:15.515
How's your relationship
with Gen. Maddux these days?

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.614
Why?

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:19.524
Eduardo O'Brian's using
a C-141 cargo plane

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.789
to transport the weapons
out of the country.

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:23.421
If the Air Force
can make sure

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.022
the plane never
touches the ground,

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.191
we'll handle the rest.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.461
The rest?

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.468
What on earth
are you talking about?

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.731
I gotta go.

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.829
I got a rocket launcher
to knock out.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.305
Good luck with Maddux, Devon.

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.672
Michael...

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.271
Michael, surely
you're not serious.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.541
I couldn't be
more serious, buddy.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.708
The pieces
are falling into place.

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.376
They're gonna use
that rocket launcher

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.817
to bombard the depot.

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:03.631
We're ready, sir.

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.333
Okay. Fire three rockets

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.874
at the primary target.

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:17.407
Then knock off the bridge
on the road up here.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.740
Yes, sir.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.475
Fire!

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.287
Michael, the bridge is gone.

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.118
Better the bridge than us.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.953
The chasm is over 50 feet.

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:33.459
All right,
give me everything you got!

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.001
Fire at him directly!

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.060
Yes, sir.

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.439
Get them out!

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.738
We'll never survive
a direct hit.

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:56.283
We got no choice, KITT.

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:17.034
We're moving!

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.594
Fire! Fire!

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.275
Michael, look!

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:35.779
KITT, transfer
all power sources to turbo.

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:58.838
All right!

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.731
Of all the weapons,
the knife is my favorite.

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:41.211
I killed my first man
with a knife.

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:59.967
KITT, give me
everything you got on the jammer.

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:20.555
I got it.

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.156
Hi.
Hi.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.958
Hey, hey!
Just in time, huh?

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.023
Where's David?

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.809
Amazing what
a few flowers will do.

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:47.143
Sure you can't hang
around a couple of days, huh?

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:49.621
No, I gotta be in Denver
by tomorrow morning.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:51.180
Boss keeps you
jumping, huh?

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:53.158
Mine never leaves
his office.

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.027
Is the bellman here?

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:56.154
Oh. Hi.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.219
Hi.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.163
I just stopped by
to say goodbye.

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.564
Oh, Michael.

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:03.226
Oh, I can't believe
it's been, what,

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.305
five or six days
since we met in Calexico?

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.705
Do you know
it's only been four?

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.906
Michael, thanks so much.

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.410
Did it help?

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.538
Finding Arthur's murderer?

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:15.241
Hmm. Yes and no.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:18.145
Mostly yes. I think
what I need now is time.

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:19.277
Okay.

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:22.352
Come in.
The bags are by the door.

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:24.448
How thoughtful.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.594
Archibald,
what are you doing here?

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.930
Well, contrary
to popular belief,

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:33.193
I do get out
once in a while.

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.394
You must be
Joanna St. John.

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.494
How do you do?

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:41.166
Archibald Hendley.
It's nice to meet you.

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:43.334
You know,
when David told me about you,

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:44.935
I was mildly curious.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.173
But when he mentioned
the incredible past

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.476
that you'd invented,

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:50.483
well, I just knew
I had to meet you.

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:52.610
That sounds like a compliment,
and I thank you.

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.915
Do you know what I find
the most intriguing?

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.288
I'm finding that
the reality of meeting you

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.951
equals the fantasy.

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.722
Well, that's a rare occurrence

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:02.956
in a workaday world.

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.520
Yes, rare indeed.

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.259
And so full of promise.

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:08.460
Uh, the bags
are by the door.

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.866
Oh, yeah.

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:11.904
Come on,
I'll help you with the bags.

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.701
I have a
proposition for you.

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.264
A proposition?

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:19.675
I thought you said he never
gets out of the office.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.381
Do you always
work alone?

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:28.979
Yeah, always.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:31.458
I beg your pardon.

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:34.355
Well, in the manner
of speaking.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:35.855
Me, too.

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.727
But if I ever needed
a partner,

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.232
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather have.

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.268
The same goes for me, too.

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:43.860
Thanks a lot, pal.

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:46.064
Tell that lady
goodbye for me, all right?

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.970
All right. Straight ahead.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:03.519
David, I want you to meet
a new member of the team.

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:06.023
Arch, you know
I work alone.

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:09.028
You used to work alone.
