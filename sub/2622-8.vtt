00:04.379 --> 00:05.421
Hello?

00:05.588 --> 00:08.632
It's me. I know
you can't stand to be in the same room.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.552
I just thought I'd try and apologize
over the phone...

00:16.516 --> 00:18.100
Hello?

00:19.019 --> 00:22.187
Look, I never
should've kissed your girlfriend, and I'm...

00:26.067 --> 00:27.109
Stop calling!

00:27.277 --> 00:31.280
Hey, hey, hey. This is 92.3 WXRK K-Rock...

00:31.448 --> 00:34.283
...calling with our $1000 daily challenge.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.701
All right.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.077
What is the name of...

00:37.245 --> 00:41.874
...your roommate who is very, very sorry
and would do anything...?

01:30.048 --> 01:31.840
Ugh, turkey.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.344
Ugh, giving thanks. Ugh.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.639
Look, everyone,
it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.141
Are things with Joey any better?

01:41.309 --> 01:44.103
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

01:44.270 --> 01:46.146
...trying to get him to talk to me.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.149
Oh, wow. Eight hours.

01:49.317 --> 01:52.986
So you could probably really use one
of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?

01:53.154 --> 01:57.616
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that can be stolen from your office?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.370
You shouldn't.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.498
Speaking of Christmas...

02:04.666 --> 02:08.669
...since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have like no money...

02:08.836 --> 02:12.673
...this year maybe we could do Secret Santa
and then we each only buy one gift.

02:12.841 --> 02:16.927
And there's the added mystery of,
you know, who gets who.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.222
Who gets "whom."

02:22.392 --> 02:24.560
I don't know why I do that.

02:27.897 --> 02:31.191
Oh, I'm gonna take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.235
We haven't eaten yet.

02:33.903 --> 02:38.031
I know, but all that work you're doing
to get it ready, and I just...

02:40.076 --> 02:42.870
Hey, did either of you pick Rachel
for your Secret Santa?

02:43.037 --> 02:46.415
- Because I wanna trade for her.
- I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.958
Ooh.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.294
Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her
so badly?

02:50.461 --> 02:52.421
Because she exchanges
every gift she gets.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.090
It's, like, impossible
to get her something she likes.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.842
Come on, let's trade.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.803
That's not true.
I got her that backpack and she loved it.

02:59.971 --> 03:04.349
I remember how much she was crying
the day that big dog ran off with...

03:05.977 --> 03:08.187
There was no big dog.

03:09.105 --> 03:13.859
This sucks, because I already got her
this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.361
- Her initials.
- Oh.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.533
Maybe you can give it to somebody else.
Oh. Like Ross Geller.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.745
Oh, you know what, though?
It's a girlie briefcase.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.040
Who cares? He works in a museum.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.877
Hey, what time is it?
The big game's about to start.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.214
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.965
Thanks.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.803
What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!

03:41.971 --> 03:44.973
- God, what happened?
- Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.101
People are trying to sleep in here.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.270
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.357
- Open it up. Let me see.
- Oh, I can't. It really kills.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.817
Well, maybe you should put
some ice on it.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.822
- Ooh, it looks bad.
- Maybe we should take you to a doctor.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.824
No, my eye doctor is Richard.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.119
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.830
He's really picky about his patients.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.917
Okay, you've gotta go.
What's his office number?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.836
Oh, like I remember his office number.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.505
Speed dial 7.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.970
Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye, and...

04:23.554 --> 04:26.431
Is Richard Burke in today?

04:26.599 --> 04:29.184
He's out of town.
Does she wanna see the on-call doctor?

04:29.352 --> 04:32.980
- Yes.
- Yes. She's very excited about that.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.192
It's so cool.

04:37.360 --> 04:43.156
Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef
and I get to make all the decisions.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.660
Hey, hey, I thought she told you
to follow the recipe exactly.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.870
Okay, get out of my kitchen.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.208
All right, okay. I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.044
When I went into the apartment,
he went to his bedroom...

04:56.212 --> 04:58.463
...but he only slammed the door once.

04:59.215 --> 05:02.009
I mean, yeah,
he gave me the finger while doing it.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.681
All right, I gotta call my mom and ask her
a left-handed cooking question.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.313
So listen,
I picked Monica for Secret Santa...

05:14.480 --> 05:16.565
...but I'm getting her something
for Hanukkah.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.941
You wanna switch?

05:18.109 --> 05:21.570
Oh, you know what?
I was trying to trade for, uh, ahem, well, you.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.742
Really? Wow, that's so nice.
What are you gonna get me?

05:26.909 --> 05:30.329
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.208
Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe
will switch with me.

05:35.376 --> 05:39.963
Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.133
Oh, that's not true.
I got her lots of stuff she never took back.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.509
Like?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.678
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.264
When was the last time
you saw her wear it?

05:49.432 --> 05:52.934
Well, she wore it all Christmas day
and then, uh...

05:54.312 --> 05:55.479
Big dog?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.110
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.570
What are you doing?

06:03.738 --> 06:06.323
Sending back this stuff Chandler bought
out of guilt.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.660
- Everything? Even the TV?
- No, I'm gonna put that in my room.

06:12.288 --> 06:16.458
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.877
But don't you think
you could hear the guy out?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.754
When you and Rachel were together...

06:20.922 --> 06:23.423
...if Chandler had kissed her,
would you hear him out?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.133
That's a good point.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.553
So how long you gonna punish him?

06:28.721 --> 06:30.305
Five years.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.516
You've sentenced him?

06:32.683 --> 06:35.769
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.981
- But, Joey, the guy's your best friend.
- No, was my best friend.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.359
I don't know why
you're pushing for him so hard.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.071
With him out of the way as my best friend,
there's a spot open.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.951
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.994
Wow. I'm honored.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.081
You know what I'm gonna do
as my first act as your best friend?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.708
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.962
All right.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.339
Oh, but if you weren't my best friend...

07:04.507 --> 07:05.715
Ah.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.553
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

07:09.720 --> 07:12.013
I walk in the room,
and he won't even talk to me.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.350
He just mumbles something in Italian.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.104
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.694
Hey, Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.863
I thought you were Chandler.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.868
But, um, one of you is over there.

07:38.916 --> 07:39.958
Oh.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.461
Hey, Joe.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.305
I'll be right with you, okay?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.599
Thanks for coming in.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.978
Oh, my God.
How cute is the on-call doctor?

08:00.146 --> 08:03.773
Oh. So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.570
Dr. Burke will see you now.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.239
Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke.
Dr. Burke's out of town.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.158
The on-call doctor will see me now.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.910
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.497
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.541
Ready?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.926
Hey, I'm sorry. That...

08:31.886 --> 08:34.554
- Where you going?
- My folks'.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.389
Oh. Uh...

08:36.557 --> 08:38.140
When you coming back?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.558
I don't know.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.854
I might stay there for a few days
while I look for an apartment.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.814
What?

08:45.274 --> 08:48.860
Yeah, you know, at first I thought
we could talk about this, work it out.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.279
But seeing you two together, I don't...

08:51.447 --> 08:55.450
Hey, look, what do you want me to say?
Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.286
It's not about her. Okay?

08:58.454 --> 09:01.957
But seeing you two together
just reminds me of what you did.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.794
And I don't wanna live with someone
who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.339
- So I'll see you.
- Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.634
- I just... I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.387
And that's why I'm leaving.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.058
Look, if you're not gonna stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

09:22.228 --> 09:26.356
Okay? They have had a very difficult year,
what with the robbery and all.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.525
When that guy was robbing us...

09:28.693 --> 09:31.570
...and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for six hours...

09:31.737 --> 09:33.446
...do you know what I was doing?

09:33.614 --> 09:35.490
I was thinking about how I let you down.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.826
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.746
If I'd have known what kind of friend you
were gonna be, I wouldn't have worried.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.873
- See you around.
- All right, wait, come on.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.919
Just wait one second.
There has to be something that I can do.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.421
If we still had that unit...

09:49.589 --> 09:53.341
...I would get in there for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.682
What?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.017
We got a box.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.773
I remember the last time I saw you.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.484
It was the morning I left for college.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.863
You were just standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.199
Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.036
Gotta tell you, you look great now.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.623
- You look great too.
- You're an excellent patient.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.459
So how does it look?

10:27.627 --> 10:31.755
You've got a little scratch on your cornea.
You're gonna have to wear a patch.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.715
Like a pirate?

10:34.508 --> 10:35.634
If that helps you.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.475
Ahem. So how long have you been working
with your dad?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.978
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.731
I moved back here a couple months ago.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.066
Ah.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.818
- Big family dinner tonight?
- Uh...

10:54.737 --> 10:56.446
No way.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.740
I was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.325
- Oh.
- But we broke up.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.785
Oh?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.580
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.415
Oh.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.795
So you made her
walk the plank, aye, matey?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.464
You're not wearing the patch yet.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.552
I know.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.478
- He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
- I know. It's sick.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.564
- Why is it sick?
- Because it's Richard's son.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.317
It's like inviting a Greek tragedy
over for dinner.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.571
I mean, come on,
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

11:38.739 --> 11:41.950
Yeah, I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.704
- Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.
- Yeah.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.748
- What's twisted?
- Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.458
Ew.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.628
Ew, ew, ew.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.756
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.760
Is he okay in there?

12:00.928 --> 12:03.346
He's fine.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.808
You know, if things work out
between you and Richard's son...

12:06.976 --> 12:11.271
...you'll be able to tell your kids
that you slept with their grandfather.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.607
Fine, judge all you want to.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.903
But married a lesbian, left a man at the altar,
fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

12:19.071 --> 12:22.115
...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire,
live in a box.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.250
So, now, ahem,
what exactly is the point of the box?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.169
Chandler?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.630
The meaning of the box is threefold.

12:38.007 --> 12:42.260
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

12:42.428 --> 12:47.807
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.517
And three...

12:50.519 --> 12:52.437
...it hurts.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.899
- Oh, hey, hey, uh...
- Hmm?

12:56.066 --> 12:58.276
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.694
Can I see it?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.280
Why?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.657
I just wanna check something.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.534
Okay.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.372
Now we'll see.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.250
Air hole! Air hole!

13:15.795 --> 13:19.088
Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.678
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.722
Huh.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.892
Well, maybe, it, uh...

13:31.060 --> 13:32.727
...it changed.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.356
Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.442
Isn't it better that I exchange it
for something that I enjoy...

13:39.610 --> 13:41.361
...and I can get a lot of use out of?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.238
What did you get?

13:43.405 --> 13:45.156
Credit.

13:47.576 --> 13:52.247
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.792
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.337
Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.632
- This is Phoebe.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.842
- And Joey.
- Hey.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.593
- Joey.
- My brother, Ross.

14:05.761 --> 14:06.928
- Hey.
- And Rachel.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.763
- Hi.
- Ahem.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.269
- That's Chandler.
- How do you do?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.189
- What's...?
- Um, well, he's, um...

14:18.357 --> 14:20.692
He's doing some thinking.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.529
He's got it.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.947
- Yes!
- Yeah!

14:26.115 --> 14:29.534
- What happened?
- You kissed my girlfriend.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.081
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.666
"Like them" like them...

14:36.834 --> 14:40.128
...or "I'd like to get store credit
for that amount" like them?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.596
All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.348
- Where can I wash up?
- Here.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.100
Let me show you.

14:54.268 --> 14:58.313
The towels are hanging next to the sink.
And you can use the fancy soap. Ha, ha.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.189
Thank you.

15:00.357 --> 15:04.110
Fancy soap?
I thought we were saving that for the Pope.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.155
See? He's nice, right?

15:07.323 --> 15:11.034
Do you really wanna be in a relationship
where you can actually use the phrase...

15:11.201 --> 15:13.328
..."That's not how your dad
used to do it"?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.710
Wow, everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

15:20.878 --> 15:21.961
Saved you a seat.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.298
Sick, sick, sick.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.718
Oh, I'll get it.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.928
Gotcha.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.934
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.479
- Sorry.
- I don't think you should be talking at all.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.941
I think you got too much thinking to do
to be talking and making jokes.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.817
Okay, okay, you got it.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.403
- Ross, could you pass me the yams?
- Sure.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.823
Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.705
Will you stop?
What is the matter with you?

15:57.873 --> 15:59.499
Heh, heh. We've got company.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.836
There's nothing the matter with me.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.214
See, I'm not completely devoid
of sentiment.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.007
See, I have feelings.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.135
Okay, fine.

16:16.517 --> 16:21.104
You can't tell, but I'm trying
to break the tension by mooning you guys.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.403
All right, look.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.656
If this is just a big joke to you,
then forget about it, all right?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.658
This means something to me.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.536
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.372
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.583
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

16:42.751 --> 16:47.922
I want you to be my friend again.
I swear I won't say another word tonight.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.259
- So you're gonna take this thing seriously?
- Absolutely.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.970
That sounds like another word to me.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.390
Are you gonna take this seriously?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.603
Okay.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.358
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

17:08.234 --> 17:11.445
This is a movie stub from our first date.

17:11.613 --> 17:15.450
This is an eggshell from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

17:15.992 --> 17:20.246
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

17:20.414 --> 17:21.873
...were together.

17:22.708 --> 17:28.087
Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.424
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.093
Though...

17:34.261 --> 17:36.345
...you're not supposed to take these.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.643
It's like a million years old.

17:42.811 --> 17:46.272
We actually...
We have people looking for that.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.029
Oh, this always happens.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.073
Here, let me, um...

17:55.574 --> 17:57.033
Thank you.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.247
You have very beautiful...

18:03.415 --> 18:05.041
...eye.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.669
My friends all think this is weird.

18:09.338 --> 18:13.466
I thought it was gonna be weird.
I almost called to cancel, but it really isn't.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.428
I know. I mean, it's like me and your dad,
that's a totally separate thing.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.930
Oh, I totally agree.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.975
I mean, we're just two people
who find each other...

18:23.143 --> 18:25.228
...very attractive.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.979
Right?

18:37.699 --> 18:41.035
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.454
No, no, really. Oh, was that not okay?

18:43.622 --> 18:44.997
No, no, no, that was good.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.584
That was, uh... That was a good kiss.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.547
- Oh, my God. It didn't remind you of my...?
- Oh, don't say it.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.632
- But it did, didn't it?
- Yes!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.467
Oh, man.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.469
I know.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.814
I got it.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.736
Oh.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.614
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.326
- I want you to know how sorry I am...
- It's okay.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.370
Chandler's the one I'm mad at, so...

19:24.913 --> 19:27.415
Well, I'm still sorry.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.002
- Is he here?
- In the box.

19:38.886 --> 19:39.927
Chandler?

19:40.095 --> 19:42.722
Oh, he can't talk right now.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.016
Why not? What's going on?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.227
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.481
- By being in a box?
- Joey had reasons.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.401
They were threefold.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.864
Oh. Well, uh...

20:00.824 --> 20:03.951
...you not being able to talk
might actually make this easier.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.288
Listen, um...

20:15.797 --> 20:17.173
Listen.

20:17.341 --> 20:23.638
I don't wanna be someone
who comes between two best friends.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.642
I just... I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.603
And I don't wanna be the cause of that.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.148
So I don't think
we can see each other anymore.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.735
I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.571
I'm gonna stay there for a while.

20:45.619 --> 20:49.455
I think this could have been something
really amazing.

20:49.623 --> 20:54.168
But, you know,
this is probably for the best.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.170
You know?

21:01.009 --> 21:02.802
I'm gonna miss you.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.932
Goodbye, Chandler.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.027
Open the box.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.029
- What?
- He can still catch her.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.825
Hey, come on. Get out of there.
Get out of there.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.121
- So...?
- Yeah, we're gonna be fine. Get out.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.168
You did some real good thinking in there.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.087
I mean, this is...

21:43.051 --> 21:44.969
Now go. You could still catch her.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.888
And merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.395
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.194
Oh, he sees her.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.239
Aw, and he's catching up to her.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.908
Oh, she sees him.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.494
- Oh, they're hugging.
- Aw.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.373
He's taking her purse.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.378
Uh, that's not them.
I'm gonna go call the police.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.257
- Oh, there they are.
- Where?

22:23.425 --> 22:24.800
- Ah!
- Oh.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.260
Aw.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.600
All right, get a room.
