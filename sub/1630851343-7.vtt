with everything I got.

11:29.973 --> 11:32.307
-Huh?
-[hollywood] I hear you,
ralph angel.

11:32.392 --> 11:37.645
So our lawyer tells me that
theo is not in jail anymore.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.483
He made one phone call

11:41.568 --> 11:42.534
after his arrest...

11:43.653 --> 11:44.736
To sam landry.

11:45.989 --> 11:47.989
After that,
the charges were dropped.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.843
It looks like theo's
making a deal.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.829
Looks like I got played.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.833
That's what it looks like.

11:59.836 --> 12:00.835
That's on me.

12:02.506 --> 12:04.589
Imma have to work
this out with sam landry.

12:04.674 --> 12:07.258
No, it's too dangerous
in your current situation.

12:08.345 --> 12:09.728
I'll talk to sam.

12:09.846 --> 12:10.678
[violet] no.

12:11.515 --> 12:12.313
I'll go.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.531
The hell you will.

12:14.184 --> 12:15.016
Sam and me...

12:15.902 --> 12:17.035
Got a lot of history.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.021
It's time I remind him
of his place in it.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.108
[hollywood] well, I'm
going with you.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.032
[violet] I love you...

12:32.953 --> 12:33.952
No matter what.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.539
I love you, too.

12:39.793 --> 12:40.875
No matter what.

12:51.888 --> 12:53.838
Jimmy dale was
smooth about it.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.039
I can see that now.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.212
So, when nova and I
would visit violet,

13:01.314 --> 13:05.567
he would ask me about my
dreams and my future plans.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.953
Made me feel real...

13:10.123 --> 13:12.574
Grown up and... Smart.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.128
But then he tried to
take it to the next level.

13:19.583 --> 13:20.915
And I didn't want that.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.250
But he didn't care.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.468
He assaulted you.

13:24.087 --> 13:25.086
He tried.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.722
But luckily,
my daddy taught me

13:27.808 --> 13:29.641
how to throw
a pretty nice right-cross.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.145
[mumbles]

13:34.264 --> 13:36.014
upper cut wasn't nothing
to mess with either.

13:36.099 --> 13:36.948
[both chuckle softly]

13:38.268 --> 13:40.151
why didn't you
come to me, billie?

13:40.270 --> 13:42.487
I would've handled that
son of a bitch myself.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.771
I told mama.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.240
But...

13:45.325 --> 13:46.941
She told me it was my fault.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.580
Said that with the way that
I acted and I dressed,
I should...

13:52.666 --> 13:54.666
Be grateful
that the worst didn't happen.

13:55.452 --> 13:58.203
Your mama
was from a different time...

13:58.288 --> 13:59.954
I know she didn't
mean to harm you.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.625
But why didn't you
still come to me?

14:05.128 --> 14:06.628
How could I come
to you, daddy?

14:08.798 --> 14:10.515
The whole town was whispering.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.302
And you never said one word.

14:15.305 --> 14:16.771
You just...

14:16.857 --> 14:18.690
Pretended like I was some
dirty little secret

14:18.808 --> 14:20.191
you didn't wanna talk about.

14:22.479 --> 14:24.863
And I figured...
You'd believe the talk.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.371
Look, I... I didn't know
what to believe.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.376
I mean, I guess
I just thought that it would
all go away.

14:39.663 --> 14:43.464
I mean, I look back on myself
at that time,
and I'm ashamed.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.335
I mean, we were all friends,
ernest, jimmy dale...

14:48.171 --> 14:50.421
[sighs]

14:50.507 --> 14:52.840
and at the time, I didn't know
he was galivanting around.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.594
But it was easier for me to...

14:57.397 --> 14:59.998
To believe him
than it was to defend you,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.849
and I took the easy way out.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.606
And I hurt you so bad,
you left and you never
came back.

15:14.197 --> 15:15.363
But I'm glad you're back.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.019
Not just
in st. Jo or this house...

15:26.376 --> 15:27.542
But back with me.

15:28.712 --> 15:30.595
[sighs]

15:30.714 --> 15:32.430
I'm sorry, billie,
for all of it.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.470
-[samuel] yeah, that is great.
-[woman] hey, excuse me,
you can't go in there.

15:39.556 --> 15:41.272
Yeah, tom,
let gonna call you back.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.440
All right.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.526
-Mr. Landry
-it's fine, thank you.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.895
Violet, mr. Hollywood.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.397
What brings such
a lovely couple to my door?

15:49.482 --> 15:53.201
Well, I'm sure you've heard
of my nephew's arrest.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.402
[samuel] ralph angel.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.404
Bad news travels fast.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.790
-It really seemed like he had
turned his life around.
-[phone ringing]

15:58.908 --> 16:03.161
how did theo jackson, who was
arrested for the same crime,

16:03.246 --> 16:05.079
mysteriously be released...

16:06.082 --> 16:07.632
After a phone call to you?

16:07.751 --> 16:09.801
Well, there's
no mystery to it.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.054
Theo was just smart enough
not to get caught on
the surveillance footage.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.106
What surveillance footage?

16:18.428 --> 16:21.396
[samuel] ralph angel
was smart to turn off
the security cameras,

16:21.481 --> 16:22.347
but we had backups.

16:22.932 --> 16:24.015
Less visible ones.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.417
Theo was in on this with you
from the beginning.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.603
You set ralph angel up.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.906
Set him up? Ralph angel
is on that video,

16:31.992 --> 16:34.025
acting completely
of his own accord.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.943
I knew you was low...

16:37.614 --> 16:40.398
But I didn't even think
you would stoop to this.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.166
I'm not fooling with you,

16:42.285 --> 16:44.335
you gonna drop
these charges, sam.

16:44.454 --> 16:47.088
Company protocol mandates...

16:47.173 --> 16:51.042
That we prosecute all these
cases to the full extent
of the law.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.910
[violet] that is horseshit.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.462
Now, you owe me this.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.882
In fact, you owe my entire
family for all the crap

16:57.967 --> 17:00.802
that the landrys have
pulled for decades.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.055
The landrys are
the victims here, vi.

17:04.140 --> 17:09.227
I have been out-maneuvered
by you bordelons
more than once over the years.

17:09.312 --> 17:11.396
It's what our families do.

17:11.481 --> 17:13.314
But pride goeth
before the fall.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.533
And ralph angel,
he's got a lot of pride.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.870
You've got no cards
to play this time.

17:18.988 --> 17:20.321
I made damn sure of it.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.675
[chuckles]

17:26.012 --> 17:27.078
[exhales]

17:29.165 --> 17:30.164
are you sure?

17:32.085 --> 17:34.585
How would you like to
join your sister in prison?

17:34.687 --> 17:37.388
Why would I go to prison
for getting robbed?

17:37.507 --> 17:39.290
Because you coerced
theo jackson

17:39.392 --> 17:42.310
to conspire with you
to commit fraud.

17:42.395 --> 17:46.046
We'll be pressing charges
for agricultural terrorism.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.933
Agricultural terrorism.

17:49.018 --> 17:52.520
Is that woke police's
latest catch phrase?

17:52.605 --> 17:56.407
Now, the bordelons' farm's
harvest was completely
destroyed

17:56.526 --> 17:59.744
because of excessive
levels of pesticide.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.197
I can't help it if her nephew
is such a bad farmer

18:03.283 --> 18:05.416
he can't properly
use pesticide.

18:05.535 --> 18:06.751
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.686
See, we know you did it.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.621
And we got the proof.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.624
We just don't go
around dramatically

18:13.710 --> 18:16.427
flashing ours
in junky-ass folders.

18:16.529 --> 18:20.548
Well, I would love to watch
you try to prove all of this

18:20.633 --> 18:23.351
in our magnificent
st. Josephine justice system.

18:23.436 --> 18:27.188
Listen, I'm not interested
in your empty threats.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.207
And I don't think your family

18:29.309 --> 18:31.726
is interested in
a drawn out trial.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.863
What would that do
to the future business of
vi's pies, hmm?

18:35.949 --> 18:39.283
Nova's career, micah's future?

18:39.402 --> 18:42.069
Charley's political
aspirations?

18:42.155 --> 18:44.071
Will blue's fancy
new school...

18:44.157 --> 18:48.159
Want a student whose
black father is on trial
for theft?

18:48.244 --> 18:49.894
There is a way out
of all this.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.413
This is all about money.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.465
I don't want
your money, violet.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.084
The only thing I want...

18:58.421 --> 18:59.587
Is the farm.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.075
Ralph angel signs over
the farm to me,

19:04.177 --> 19:05.760
and the rest goes away.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.054
[micah] and thank you,
thank you for your
attention in this

19:17.140 --> 19:21.392
exploration of the processes
by which enslaved africans
from diverse societies

19:21.477 --> 19:23.677
created new cultures
in the americas

19:23.780 --> 19:27.398
and on the present day status
of surviving maroon cultures,
in suriname

19:27.483 --> 19:30.902
and french guiana, jamaica,
colombia and elsewhere.

19:30.987 --> 19:32.103
[micah chuckles]

19:33.656 --> 19:36.357
[parker]
well, hold on, mr. West.

19:36.459 --> 19:37.524
[micah] yes.

19:37.627 --> 19:39.827
I wanna interrogate that
a little bit more.

19:40.296 --> 19:41.695
Okay.

19:41.798 --> 19:46.217
So, what are these modern-day
forms of slavery that
you refer to?

19:46.336 --> 19:49.754
[micah]
redlining, voter suppression,
school defunding,

19:49.839 --> 19:53.090
employment discrimination,
loan discrimination,
mass incarceration.

19:53.176 --> 19:55.343
-Oh, that's a list,
it's not an argument.
-[micah] the list

19:55.428 --> 19:58.429
is the argument.
It's... It's evidence.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.214
Evidence of a flawed system,
yes,

20:00.316 --> 20:02.350
but isn't every system flawed
in some way?

20:02.435 --> 20:07.521
Perhaps, but not every system
is designed to subjugate
a specific group of people.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.075
So then how does that make
black americans maroons?

20:11.194 --> 20:14.612
[micah] if... The structures
of a system

20:14.697 --> 20:17.782
are designed to keep a people
out of neighborhoods,

20:17.867 --> 20:18.950
out of government,

20:19.369 --> 20:20.401
out of education,

20:20.503 --> 20:22.403
out of the workforce,
and in some instances,

20:22.505 --> 20:24.288
out of society,

20:24.374 --> 20:26.757
and in prisons, and
in a constant state of danger,

20:26.876 --> 20:31.128
what else do you call that,
but being on the run,
out in the wild?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.213
[clapping]

20:34.033 --> 20:36.750
-thank you, mr. West.
-Thank you.

20:36.853 --> 20:38.936
Well, class is dismissed,

20:39.055 --> 20:40.304
and I'll see you all
next week.

20:50.900 --> 20:54.452
That was very impressive,
micah.

20:54.570 --> 20:55.569
You've grown a lot.

21:03.246 --> 21:04.578
We should celebrate.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.581
[micah]
I think I'm good.

21:08.251 --> 21:09.300
[parker] you're good?

21:09.419 --> 21:10.918
[micah] yeah, like you said,
I've grown.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.838
See you in class, professor.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.179
[ralph angel] nah.

21:24.267 --> 21:25.516
Nah, we ain't doing that.

21:25.601 --> 21:26.600
-Ralph angel--
-[ralph angel] nah,

21:26.686 --> 21:28.152
I'll take my chances
with the courts.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.688
They could take me to trial,
but they're not taking
my land.

21:32.358 --> 21:35.142
Ralph angel, you don't
want to go to trial on this.

21:35.244 --> 21:36.861
-He has you on...
-Nah.

21:36.946 --> 21:39.146
-Nah, I turned off--
-[hollywood] it was a setup.

21:39.248 --> 21:42.700
That theo,
the guy who didn't show,
all of it.

21:42.785 --> 21:44.001
Yeah, you disabled
the cameras,

21:44.120 --> 21:47.538
but they had some strategical
setup just to catch you.

21:50.927 --> 21:52.877
[ralph angel] well, I got
the best attorney, right?

21:52.962 --> 21:55.046
Can't she tell them theo
led up the whole thing?

21:55.631 --> 21:56.663
Huh?

21:56.766 --> 21:58.933
With theo's charges dropped,

21:59.969 --> 22:01.719
the da will put
the whole thing on you.

22:01.804 --> 22:03.321
On me?

22:03.423 --> 22:05.556
You will take the full brunt

22:05.641 --> 22:07.141
of the prosecution.

22:10.146 --> 22:12.279
Because of
your prior conviction,

22:13.816 --> 22:14.648
it's, um...

22:15.818 --> 22:17.001
It's a harder path.

22:18.271 --> 22:19.303
It means...

22:20.406 --> 22:21.639
Missing out

22:22.608 --> 22:24.308
on our daughter's early years.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.079
Like we missed out on blue's.

22:30.466 --> 22:36.303
Nothing is worth that gamble.
Nothing is worth
you going back to prison.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.197
I will make sure

22:47.266 --> 22:49.066
that the attorney works out

22:49.185 --> 22:52.686
a rock solid deal
with sam landry.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.875
We'll get written
and video affidavits

22:57.977 --> 23:01.579
that landry enterprises
hired you

23:01.681 --> 23:04.281
to move equipment...

23:04.384 --> 23:07.001
And because of
a clerical error...

23:08.121 --> 23:10.037
Your paperwork
just wasn't processed.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.591
Your record will remain clean,

23:13.693 --> 23:17.344
and you can just...
You can move on from this.

23:18.214 --> 23:19.130
Ra?

23:27.890 --> 23:29.573
Y'all serious right now?

23:31.978 --> 23:34.979
You're gonna just
let the family legacy
go like that?

23:42.255 --> 23:43.788
Why you giving up
so easy, huh?

23:43.890 --> 23:44.889
Because you did it.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.159
You did this!

23:49.745 --> 23:52.079
You stole that
white man's stuff, bro.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.416
You did this shit.

23:56.919 --> 23:57.751
Yeah, racism.

23:58.387 --> 24:00.337
Yeah, the system.

24:00.423 --> 24:01.589
But also,

24:02.091 --> 24:03.290
you stole it!

24:03.392 --> 24:06.010
And you were caught
red-handed, on camera!

24:08.181 --> 24:09.430
Look at all these women...

24:10.600 --> 24:12.466
Who put their family farm
in your hands...

24:12.568 --> 24:14.268
They're willing to let it go.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.438
Because
they'll let that land go

24:17.523 --> 24:18.939
before they let you go.

24:20.610 --> 24:21.942
[violet] your freedom

24:22.028 --> 24:25.296
is worth more than any land,
ralph angel.

24:47.770 --> 24:48.969
What about mama?

24:50.806 --> 24:52.223
She buried there, you know.

24:59.232 --> 25:02.566
We can... We can move her
next to daddy's,
at the cemetery.

25:03.152 --> 25:04.702
That way they'll...

25:04.820 --> 25:06.070
They'll be together.

25:07.657 --> 25:08.572
[sobs]

25:37.003 --> 25:38.702
[sighs]

25:47.513 --> 25:49.096
-[phone line ringing]
-[voicemail]<i> hey, you,</i>

25:49.215 --> 25:52.916
<i> you've reached blue.</i>
<i> Please leave a message,</i>
<i> and have an astronomical day.</i>

25:53.219 --> 25:54.051
Blue...

25:55.638 --> 25:56.854
It's your old man.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.224
Just seeing
how you doing up there.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.279
I hear you've been
killing them classes.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.483
Showin' them white kids,
what a young black man
is all about, huh.

26:11.621 --> 26:13.070
I hope you've been having fun.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.157
I'm proud of you.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.075
Okay?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.915
I just wanted to call
and let you know.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.469
I couldn't have asked
for a better...

26:29.889 --> 26:30.888
Brighter,

26:31.507 --> 26:32.673
more kind...

26:33.476 --> 26:34.508
Son.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.176
Anyway... [clears throat]

26:38.147 --> 26:40.047
keep reaching
for them stars, boy.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.349
Love you.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.192
I know
you got something to say.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.496
I can take it.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.838
[darla] I understand

27:05.758 --> 27:08.459
how frustrated
you must have been...

27:09.979 --> 27:10.878
To do that.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.019
[sighs] but I am so...

27:20.056 --> 27:21.939
Angry at you.

27:22.024 --> 27:23.941
-I know.
-No, you don't know,

27:24.026 --> 27:26.443
because I have never
actually told you
how I really feel.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.064
You endangered our family.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.318
You betrayed my trust.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.270
You made me go against my gut.

27:36.372 --> 27:37.271
You made a fool

27:37.373 --> 27:38.789
out of all of the work that

27:38.874 --> 27:40.407
we supposedly done together.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.909
And what is worse

27:42.011 --> 27:43.293
is that I bottled up

27:43.379 --> 27:45.212
all of this anger inside...

27:47.616 --> 27:49.333
So that I wouldn't hurt you.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.553
[ralph angel] I know
I hurt you real bad.

27:53.222 --> 27:55.255
You ain't gotta bottle it up.

27:57.393 --> 27:59.476
You have every right
to feel how you feel.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.346
You know,
I thought I was past all this.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.516
I'm still trying to be better.

28:07.236 --> 28:09.153
I'm still trying to make good.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.942
I'm still trying not to
lose hope...

28:17.329 --> 28:18.495
In myself.

28:18.581 --> 28:19.863
No more secrets.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.832
No more lies.

28:22.818 --> 28:24.668
Let's make both of
our children proud, okay?

28:26.122 --> 28:27.955
-I'm sorry.
-[darla] I know.

28:41.670 --> 28:42.936
[knock at door]

28:53.315 --> 28:54.565
-hi.
-[charley] hi.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.918
Just wanted
to check in on you.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.154
Can I come in?

29:00.790 --> 29:01.739
I, uh...

29:03.042 --> 29:04.491
I'm not doing too great,
charley.

29:04.577 --> 29:08.262
-None of us are.
-No, I'm trying
to tell you something.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.915
The police broke in here...

29:12.468 --> 29:13.333
Yesterday.

29:14.637 --> 29:15.469
What?

29:15.971 --> 29:16.804
Wait.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.150
They terrorized me.

29:37.026 --> 29:37.941
[sobs]

29:41.997 --> 29:42.830
[sniffles]

29:45.000 --> 29:47.868
but really,
this is about my power...

29:48.788 --> 29:51.789
My activism, my voice...

29:53.092 --> 29:55.209
My skin, my gender...

29:56.428 --> 29:58.295
My everything.

29:58.380 --> 30:02.299
Yes. You are everything.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.601
They didn't take anything
from you.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.187
They gave you something.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.140
More power.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.192
More fire.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.694
More.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.398
Yes?

30:20.202 --> 30:21.268
Yes.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.061
Thank you.

30:33.549 --> 30:34.381
Everything is...

30:35.284 --> 30:38.035
[exhales]
hitting me all at once.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.537
I've seen attacks
on other activists, but...

30:42.291 --> 30:44.458
This is the first time
I felt it so directly.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.944
Every step towards progress
gets pushed back tenfold.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.630
That's how
they want you to feel.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.131
We have to stay fighting.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.699
The powers that be always win.

30:54.136 --> 30:55.385
[charley]
look, I hear you.

30:58.591 --> 31:00.974
And I am frustrated too.

31:01.093 --> 31:04.228
I mean, I have
a position of power,

31:04.313 --> 31:06.129
in the local government here

31:06.232 --> 31:07.731
and I still didn't have
the leverage

31:08.317 --> 31:09.650
to save the farm.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.789
And that is why
I am considering

31:16.775 --> 31:18.158
a run for congress.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.359
For real?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.994
I'm thinking about it.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.615
But whether I do or not,

31:25.618 --> 31:27.501
I will need you in the fight
with me.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.752
So promise me...

31:29.672 --> 31:31.821
You will not let those
bastards succeed

31:31.924 --> 31:33.123
in trying to break you.

31:34.343 --> 31:37.177
Get up and fight again.

31:38.514 --> 31:39.463
I promise.

31:41.634 --> 31:42.633
Get some rest.

31:44.019 --> 31:45.769
Take this time.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.105
It belongs to you.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.942
This peace belongs to you.

31:53.028 --> 31:56.313
This home belongs to you.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.732
[billie] morning, daddy.

31:58.817 --> 31:59.967
Oh, morning.

32:00.536 --> 32:02.069
Made you some breakfast.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.804
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.606
Hey.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.874
Yeah, I found the recipe in
one of mama's old albums.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.444
-And I got cereal on standby
just in case it's terrible.
-[chuckles]

32:15.134 --> 32:16.416
this is delicious.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.919
-Really?
-Yeah, this is delicious.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.587
You... You want to join me?

32:20.673 --> 32:22.673
Uh, yeah, let me get a plate.

32:23.058 --> 32:24.174
Uh, you...

32:25.811 --> 32:28.312
You ever thought about staying
a while longer?

32:28.397 --> 32:32.265
I mean, kids have grown
and you can do what you want.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.883
May be nice.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.987
You know, even go fishin,
maybe visit some more, and...

32:38.157 --> 32:39.239
Catch up some more.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.310
Yeah.

32:44.246 --> 32:45.646
I'll definitely think
about that.

32:45.748 --> 32:46.663
Okay.

32:52.504 --> 32:53.704
First, how are you?

32:54.823 --> 32:55.756
[celine]
yeah, okay.

32:56.392 --> 32:57.290
And gabriel?

32:57.393 --> 32:59.376
They got gabriel in school.

33:01.063 --> 33:02.379
It's a good place.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.182
Good people.

33:06.885 --> 33:10.137
You scared the life out of me,
disappearing like that.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.855
-I was ashamed.
-You should be.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.860
I opened my heart,

33:17.863 --> 33:18.745
my life,

33:19.231 --> 33:20.647
my wallet to you.

33:20.733 --> 33:21.898
And in return,

33:23.452 --> 33:24.868
you hit on my husband.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.537
Well, I'm sorry.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.040
You need to know,

33:30.125 --> 33:31.541
hollywood put me
straight in my place.

33:32.411 --> 33:33.744
He wasn't having none of me.

33:34.747 --> 33:36.163
Guess you got
the last good one in.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.082
I don't need you to tell me
nothing about my husband.

33:41.754 --> 33:42.919
I know that man.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.373
This is not the person
I want to be.

33:46.475 --> 33:47.591
It isn't you.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.229
Look, I consider myself
a good judge of character.

33:52.314 --> 33:54.765
You are a good person, celine.

33:55.918 --> 33:58.452
Too good for
some mess like this.

33:59.288 --> 34:00.654
What were you thinking?

34:00.756 --> 34:01.621
I don't know.

34:04.393 --> 34:05.792
Maybe 'cause...

34:07.613 --> 34:09.579
I've either been
with my daddy,

34:11.433 --> 34:13.734
boyfriends or my husband
all my life.

34:14.837 --> 34:17.671
I don't even know who I am
without a man to tell me.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.840
Hmm?

34:19.942 --> 34:21.408
And I know you,

34:21.510 --> 34:24.277
queen vi,
think it's pathetic.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.014
No, baby,

34:29.184 --> 34:30.467
that's real.

34:33.021 --> 34:34.688
When it finally hit me,
I was...

34:36.024 --> 34:37.190
Alone.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.609
I panicked.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.863
[cries] and...

34:42.981 --> 34:46.533
I know I shouldn't have
disrespected you, never.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.118
Or your husband...

34:49.371 --> 34:50.654
Or your marriage.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.207
And if I could take it back...

34:55.828 --> 34:58.495
I am truly sorry.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.132
I am so, so sorry.

35:02.217 --> 35:05.168
I swear, I'm so sorry.

35:10.225 --> 35:12.676
When my first husband
and I got together,

35:14.179 --> 35:16.179
I was barely
out of high school.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.150
And when I left him,

35:20.235 --> 35:23.687
he told me that I would never
be nothing without him.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.742
Took me a lot of time
and a...

35:29.361 --> 35:30.827
Whole lot of support.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.198
Get to where
those words weren't...

35:36.368 --> 35:38.535
Always controlling
my thinking.

35:41.590 --> 35:43.206
It took me even longer...

35:45.344 --> 35:47.928
To figure out what
healthy boundaries look like

35:48.030 --> 35:49.396
in a relationship.

35:53.602 --> 35:55.168
But that's what
you gotta do.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.221
They got me going to therapy.

36:00.509 --> 36:03.860
I wa...
I wanna be strong.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.229
That's good.

36:07.449 --> 36:08.915
Nothing to be scared of.

36:11.236 --> 36:15.405
You were, truly, truly...

36:17.409 --> 36:18.625
A good friend.

36:20.462 --> 36:22.245
And I am so sorry.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.298
I am so sorry.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.551
I thank you.

36:34.977 --> 36:36.393
Um...

36:37.312 --> 36:39.396
So, here is...

36:40.933 --> 36:43.433
The little last bit
to help you.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.237
You know, my family is going
through some really...

36:49.658 --> 36:50.857
Major things right now.

36:50.943 --> 36:53.777
And so I'm not
going to be able to
see you or gabriel.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.664
And I want to
wish you blessings.

36:57.766 --> 36:58.832
You got a good boy.

37:01.336 --> 37:03.370
And you're a strong spirit,
celine.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.838
Do well by both.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.133
[door closes]

37:28.981 --> 37:30.864
[phone line ringing]

37:33.785 --> 37:35.952
[man over phone]
<i> councilwoman bordelon.</i>

37:37.155 --> 37:39.372
I'm ready to run for
united states congress.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.041
[man laughs]

37:41.159 --> 37:42.876
cutting straight to the chase.
I love it.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.527
And so does the rest
of the party.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.195
So, how do we kick this off?

37:46.298 --> 37:47.964
[man]
<i> groundwork, miss bordelon.</i>

37:48.050 --> 37:50.183
A national meet and greet,
in washington

37:50.285 --> 37:52.201
with voters and donors.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.386
Are you up for that?

37:54.339 --> 37:55.922
More than up for it.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.757
I'm ready to start winning.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.876
[man]<i> that's great,</i>
<i> but I should remind you.</i>

37:59.978 --> 38:02.045
Our real goal is to change

38:02.147 --> 38:05.065
the political dynamics
across the map.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.984
To give people a reason
to hope again.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.153
And a reason to vote again.

38:10.238 --> 38:12.055
Just like stacey did
in georgia.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.156
[charley]<i> of course.</i>

38:13.241 --> 38:15.108
[man]
<i>we need to assess if louisiana</i>

38:15.193 --> 38:16.559
<i> is the best possibility</i>
<i> for you.</i>

38:16.662 --> 38:17.661
<i> Or california.</i>

38:17.746 --> 38:19.045
Both have vulnerable seats.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.881
Our goal is to get you
to washington

38:21.984 --> 38:23.917
through whichever
avenue is best.

38:24.019 --> 38:25.735
[charley]<i> I understand</i>
<i> all that.</i>

38:25.837 --> 38:27.170
[man]<i> so how'd you make</i>
<i> the decision?</i>

38:27.255 --> 38:28.371
<i> What finally convinced you?</i>

38:31.426 --> 38:35.462
Recent personal events
have shown that

38:35.547 --> 38:38.131
I don't currently have
the power necessary

38:38.216 --> 38:40.684
to protect the people
I love the most.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.689
I want to change that.

39:06.461 --> 39:08.044
Mr. Bordelon,
you're looking well.

39:08.130 --> 39:10.246
How about we save
the small talk and get to it.

39:12.634 --> 39:13.883
Thanks for meeting with me.

39:15.087 --> 39:17.470
I wanted to make sure,
face to face, man to man,

39:17.589 --> 39:18.555
that we had a deal...

39:19.591 --> 39:20.974
Before I proceed with
the paperwork

39:21.093 --> 39:22.291
and start dealing with
your sister's

39:22.394 --> 39:24.077
pain in the ass lawyers.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.397
I don't have time
to be wasting.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.600
Then go ahead
get them papers ready.

39:33.905 --> 39:34.938
Good.

39:36.158 --> 39:37.107
Very good.

39:38.276 --> 39:39.359
You know, my daddy--

39:39.461 --> 39:41.077
I don't give a damn
about your daddy.

39:42.764 --> 39:44.998
And you sure as hell don't
give a damn about mine.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.453
You're right about that.

39:52.841 --> 39:54.657
I'll get things in order.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.926
And you'll have 45 days
to vacate.
