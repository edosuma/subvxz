WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.449
Previously on Riverdale...

00:02.452 --> 00:05.194
Hiram Lodge, you're under arrest.

00:05.197 --> 00:07.580
My own daughter, working with the Feds.

00:07.583 --> 00:08.957
Is there someone else here?

00:08.959 --> 00:11.560
I came to tell her that
I wanted to be with her.

00:11.563 --> 00:14.689
Gryphons and Gargoyles is
literally killing people.

00:14.692 --> 00:16.973
There was something
lodged in his throat.

00:16.976 --> 00:19.139
A matchbook from the Maple Club.

00:19.142 --> 00:21.139
According to Ethel, Jason Blossom

00:21.140 --> 00:22.636
is the Gargoyle King.

00:22.639 --> 00:24.017
The return of the Black Hood.

00:24.018 --> 00:25.965
Now we have two serial
killers running around.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.438
Possibly working together.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.946
Let the Farm protect you. Both of you.

00:29.949 --> 00:32.229
The Farm gave me back my brother.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.681
Yes. I see my son.

00:33.683 --> 00:36.865
Charles. And it's like I never lost him.

00:36.868 --> 00:40.988
There's a refrigerator filled
to the brim with human organs.

00:40.991 --> 00:43.417
Prepare Betty for her procedure.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.077
Get your hands off my girlfriend!

00:45.079 --> 00:47.621
Toni, this is your
only chance at freedom.

00:47.624 --> 00:49.266
No, run! Go!

00:51.827 --> 00:53.427
There, there, Antoinette.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.171
Now that you've settled down
with a cup of calming tea,

00:56.173 --> 00:58.599
why don't you explain
this to me one more time?

00:58.601 --> 01:02.010
Mrs. Blossom, Cheryl is in danger.

01:02.012 --> 01:06.005
She's at the Farm with
Betty, Kevin, and Fangs

01:06.007 --> 01:07.849
and Edgar Evernever.

01:07.851 --> 01:12.011
And he's harvesting
organs from his followers.

01:12.013 --> 01:16.432
Oh, dear. Is that what he's doing there?

01:16.434 --> 01:18.952
Well, isn't it fortunate I
was here collecting my mail

01:18.954 --> 01:21.271
at Thistlehouse when you arrived?

01:21.273 --> 01:23.273
And Betty's with him, you say?

01:23.275 --> 01:27.461
Yeah, and, um, we need to
go save them because we...

01:34.010 --> 01:36.301
Good night, my dear.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.471
Thank you for the information.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.684
Very timely indeed.

01:41.687 --> 01:43.877
I refuse to accept what Ethel said.

01:43.879 --> 01:46.462
That Jason Blossom is the Gargoyle King.

01:46.464 --> 01:48.339
Even though his coffin was empty,

01:48.341 --> 01:49.558
it defies logic.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.486
Well, say Ethel is off her rocker, okay,

01:52.488 --> 01:54.700
but where's Jason's body?

01:54.703 --> 01:58.371
And someone's still wearing
the Gargoyle King's antler, so

01:58.374 --> 02:01.620
it's up to you and me to figure
out who, Blossom or no Blossom.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.146
I keep thinking about that matchbook

02:03.148 --> 02:05.585
that Dr. Curdle found
in Baby Teeth's throat.

02:05.588 --> 02:08.148
Kurtz must have got that
at the Maple Club, right?

02:08.151 --> 02:09.667
What are you getting at, boy?

02:09.669 --> 02:12.104
Do you have a copy of
Kurtz's mugshot I can borrow?

02:22.493 --> 02:23.500
Dad?

02:25.430 --> 02:27.570
Sorry to interrupt,
but you have a visitor.

02:27.572 --> 02:29.414
She says it can't wait.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.492
Mrs. Blossom, what can I do for you?

02:32.494 --> 02:35.703
Let's not mince words, Mr. Evernever.

02:35.705 --> 02:39.508
I am fully aware of the foul
activities you're conducting here.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.584
The Topaz girl told me.

02:41.586 --> 02:46.065
I have no interest in
exposing your shenanigans.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.849
Then why have you come?

02:47.851 --> 02:50.426
You have something that I want.

02:50.428 --> 02:53.489
- Mrs. Blossom...
- You sell organs, don't you?

02:54.950 --> 02:56.450
I'm looking to buy in bulk.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.876
Did you ever see a client
in here by the name of Kurtz

03:02.879 --> 03:05.129
at the Maple Club? He looked like this.

03:06.110 --> 03:07.493
Yes.

03:07.496 --> 03:09.445
I never worked with him directly.

03:09.447 --> 03:10.522
Who did he work with?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.866
All of his interactions were with...

03:12.868 --> 03:14.951
The Red Dahlia? Penelope Blossom?

03:14.953 --> 03:16.018
Yeah.

03:17.370 --> 03:19.045
Out of curiosity,

03:19.048 --> 03:22.799
you never saw Penelope with a
young man, a young redhead, did you?

03:22.802 --> 03:25.461
You mean her kid, Jason?

03:25.463 --> 03:27.397
Yeah, sure. He came around.

03:29.652 --> 03:32.677
We've been compromised, Evelyn.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.637
We've had too many breaches.

03:34.639 --> 03:36.181
- It's time.
- Edgar.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.324
What's happening?

03:37.326 --> 03:38.975
Why is everyone acting so skittish?

03:38.977 --> 03:42.737
The outside world is encroaching
upon us, Sister Alice.

03:42.739 --> 03:44.981
We've had both defectors

03:44.983 --> 03:47.774
and unwelcome visitors.

03:47.777 --> 03:50.337
The Ascension is upon us. Tonight.

03:50.339 --> 03:51.599
The Ascension?

03:52.675 --> 03:54.824
- Tonight?
- Yes.

03:54.826 --> 03:56.492
Preparations are being made.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.764
Well, I need to find
Betty. Have you seen her?

03:58.767 --> 04:01.331
- Uh...
- She escaped, with Toni Topaz.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.407
Escaped?

04:02.409 --> 04:06.687
She was never a
believer like you, Alice.

04:06.689 --> 04:09.231
So we will ascend without her.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.853
In the wake of Mr. Lodge's arrest,

04:23.855 --> 04:26.448
you now have full
ownership of the Pembrooke

04:26.450 --> 04:29.359
and all other Lodge
investment properties.

04:29.361 --> 04:32.070
And, Veronica, you and your
mother are now the co-owners

04:32.072 --> 04:35.174
of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe
and the speakeasy beneath it.

04:37.461 --> 04:42.538
Now, there's one more
property I'm curious about.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.541
Mom, that was Veronica on the
phone with some amazing news.

04:45.543 --> 04:47.728
She said she's giving me the El Royale.

04:47.730 --> 04:49.730
That I legit own the
gym now, free and clear.

04:49.732 --> 04:53.150
That's a very generous gift, Archie.

04:53.152 --> 04:57.154
But still, I'm interested in
where you two stand romantically.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.766
Are we expecting anyone?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.238
Someone left mine at the door.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.481
Mine, too.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.999
My dad or Jellybean could have found it.

05:18.001 --> 05:19.784
Mine was waiting for me downstairs,

05:19.786 --> 05:20.777
at the speakeasy.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.412
Are we sure they're not fakes?

05:22.414 --> 05:23.645
I don't think so.

05:23.648 --> 05:25.248
And I've been trying Betty at the Farm,

05:25.250 --> 05:26.833
but she's not answering.

05:26.835 --> 05:28.769
The invitations say not to tell anyone

05:28.771 --> 05:29.919
and not to bring our phones.

05:29.921 --> 05:31.063
So it's a trap.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.566
Was there ever a doubt?

05:34.569 --> 05:36.154
We don't really have a choice.

05:52.263 --> 05:56.559
_

06:10.969 --> 06:12.097
Guys.

06:14.503 --> 06:16.812
Elizabeth. Pretty.

06:18.232 --> 06:19.506
Good evening.

06:19.508 --> 06:21.468
Come and join us, why don't you?

06:22.153 --> 06:23.444
Penelope.

06:25.197 --> 06:27.722
What... What is this place?

06:27.724 --> 06:30.942
This is the Blossom Hunting Lodge

06:30.944 --> 06:32.536
on the grounds of Thornhill.

06:33.622 --> 06:34.780
How did I get here?

06:34.782 --> 06:37.690
I bought you from Mr. Evernever.

06:37.692 --> 06:40.586
Just as he was about to cut
you into butcher's parts.

06:42.030 --> 06:45.532
Now, Agatha here will
show you to your place.

06:45.534 --> 06:47.051
Sister Woodhouse.

06:47.911 --> 06:50.245
You naughty, naughty girl.

06:50.247 --> 06:53.140
Agatha was one of my mentors.

06:53.142 --> 06:57.186
She cared for me when I was an
orphan at The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

06:57.188 --> 06:59.480
Taught me everything
I know about poisons.

07:02.042 --> 07:03.309
The murdered nuns.

07:04.904 --> 07:06.553
You did that?

07:06.555 --> 07:08.197
Oh, loose ends.

07:08.199 --> 07:10.348
Such a bother, aren't they?

07:10.350 --> 07:11.817
"Loose ends"?

07:11.819 --> 07:13.693
Is that what we are?

07:13.695 --> 07:15.412
Oh, gosh. No, not you.

07:15.414 --> 07:18.837
You are featured players.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.235
The sons and daughters of
the original Midnight Club.

07:22.237 --> 07:23.995
Jug, what's happening?

07:23.997 --> 07:25.280
I've almost figured it out.

07:25.282 --> 07:26.665
Oh, have you?

07:26.667 --> 07:29.617
Because if anybody could,
it would be you, Mr. Jones.

07:29.619 --> 07:32.271
But first, two more guests.

07:33.861 --> 07:35.781
I believe you know them already.

07:46.094 --> 07:47.686
What have I told you?

07:47.688 --> 07:50.091
No masks at the dinner table.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.119
Take them off.

07:54.644 --> 07:55.804
Oh, my God.

07:59.316 --> 08:01.857
Wait, King, before you do...

08:01.860 --> 08:03.127
Hellcaster.

08:04.088 --> 08:05.379
Care to take a stab?

08:07.127 --> 08:08.290
Sure.

08:09.951 --> 08:12.210
Arthur Conan Doyle famously said,

08:12.212 --> 08:15.121
"Once you eliminate the
impossible, whatever remains,

08:15.123 --> 08:17.641
however improbable, must be the truth."

08:18.460 --> 08:20.144
In which case,

08:20.146 --> 08:21.961
whoever it is underneath that mask

08:21.963 --> 08:23.722
must've had a connection to Hell

08:23.724 --> 08:25.315
and to you, Penelope.

08:25.317 --> 08:27.397
But it's not Jason, because he's dead.

08:28.345 --> 08:30.803
Even though his corpse is missing.

08:30.805 --> 08:33.532
The one corpse that
hasn't been accounted for

08:33.534 --> 08:36.642
and who was last seen
by the Black Hood...

08:36.645 --> 08:38.284
- Chic.
- ...is Chic.

08:43.778 --> 08:45.128
What the hell?

08:45.131 --> 08:47.361
Since when does Chic have red hair?

08:47.364 --> 08:50.503
I'm guessing since he
started working with Penelope.

08:50.506 --> 08:52.398
Doing her bidding.

08:52.401 --> 08:56.099
But this was after he got the
Gargoyle symbols tattooed on his back.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.446
It's why Ethel said the
Gargoyle King was Jason.

08:59.259 --> 09:01.531
Because you called him Jason.

09:01.534 --> 09:03.845
'Cause you dressed him up like Jason.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.315
You didn't murder Chic.

09:06.317 --> 09:08.675
After you chased him
through the woods, you...

09:08.677 --> 09:10.718
I recognized a kinship in him,

09:10.720 --> 09:11.978
and I spared him.

09:11.980 --> 09:15.199
He begged for mercy and
pledged his life to me

09:15.201 --> 09:16.724
in service of my mission.

09:16.726 --> 09:19.852
But it wasn't just your
mission, was it, Mr. Cooper?

09:19.854 --> 09:21.152
Maybe not at first,

09:21.155 --> 09:23.505
but eventually, you started
working with someone else

09:23.508 --> 09:25.816
who also had a grudge against Riverdale.

09:25.819 --> 09:29.362
In the middle of all that stuff
with the Black Hood last year,

09:29.364 --> 09:33.625
my dad was having an
affair with Penelope.

09:33.627 --> 09:36.136
Yes, I did cultivate your father's...

09:37.276 --> 09:39.431
murderous impulses,

09:39.433 --> 09:40.891
it's true.

09:40.893 --> 09:43.393
To take my revenge on a town

09:43.395 --> 09:47.260
that allowed me to be sold as
a child bride to the Blossoms.

09:47.263 --> 09:50.198
Your parents knew. I told them.

09:50.201 --> 09:52.642
And they did nothing but mock me.

09:52.645 --> 09:55.882
And years later, when my Jason
was murdered in cold blood,

09:57.392 --> 10:02.186
do you think one of
them reached out to me?

10:02.188 --> 10:06.416
No, they were too busy ignoring
the rotting, fetid truth

10:06.418 --> 10:09.753
that Riverdale is a
hideous and cruel place,

10:09.755 --> 10:11.338
twisted and cursed.

10:15.076 --> 10:17.511
And the Black Hood and I,
we were doing quite well.

10:21.216 --> 10:23.049
Exterminating its sinners.

10:23.051 --> 10:24.709
Until my dad got arrested.

10:24.711 --> 10:28.628
Yes, but that was fine because
Hal's disciple came to me,

10:28.631 --> 10:30.648
lost, and I gave him purpose.

10:30.651 --> 10:32.634
To continue our great work.

10:32.636 --> 10:34.185
But not as the Black Hood.

10:34.187 --> 10:36.822
So instead, you made him
dress up like the boogeyman.

10:38.284 --> 10:39.641
The Gargoyle King.

10:39.643 --> 10:44.519
You introduced G&G to
our parents 25 years ago,

10:44.522 --> 10:48.510
and then reintroduced
it this year to Chic.

10:48.513 --> 10:50.836
- His name is Jason.
- Who gave it to...

10:52.169 --> 10:53.686
Ben Button.

10:53.689 --> 10:55.769
Who started playing with Dilton Doiley.

10:56.749 --> 10:58.235
Then Ethel Muggs.

11:00.121 --> 11:05.559
And then G&G spread
like a virus or a poison.

11:05.561 --> 11:08.219
And the true mastermind behind it all...

11:08.221 --> 11:10.897
the true king is you, Penelope.

11:10.899 --> 11:12.382
Oh.

11:12.384 --> 11:13.861
Well done.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.683
Well done.

11:19.015 --> 11:22.659
But now, it's time to
play one final round.

11:22.661 --> 11:25.236
With you, the Midnight children.

11:25.238 --> 11:26.622
To what end?

11:26.624 --> 11:29.148
Say it's to reveal your true nature.

11:29.150 --> 11:34.696
To prove that you are as dark-hearted
as the town that birthed you.

11:34.698 --> 11:35.996
And what?

11:35.999 --> 11:37.532
If we win, we escape?

11:37.534 --> 11:38.658
You won't win.

11:38.660 --> 11:40.243
So what happens if we lose?

11:40.245 --> 11:44.589
Well, then, your parents will
feel the pain that I felt.

11:44.591 --> 11:46.874
The death of a child.

11:46.876 --> 11:49.019
Could there by anything more dreadful?

11:49.021 --> 11:50.712
You're nuts.

11:54.384 --> 11:55.567
It is time.

11:58.105 --> 12:00.065
Come to the lawn for the gathering.

12:06.187 --> 12:09.564
The task before you is simple.

12:09.566 --> 12:13.317
Make it through the
woods, survive the night.

12:13.319 --> 12:15.959
You will be tested, each of you.

12:15.962 --> 12:19.368
Refuse my tests or try to escape,

12:19.371 --> 12:22.537
and my Gargoyle minion will kill you.

12:24.063 --> 12:27.040
May the final quest begin!

12:29.886 --> 12:31.895
I'd start running if I were you.

12:46.370 --> 12:49.465
The good news is, if Penelope
wanted us dead, we would be.

12:49.468 --> 12:50.556
She wants us alive.

12:50.559 --> 12:54.825
Yeah, well, at least long enough to
complete her bizarre social experiment.

12:54.828 --> 12:56.068
Yeah, or die trying.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.820
We don't even know where to go.

12:57.822 --> 13:01.299
Actually, Enchantress, we might.

13:02.911 --> 13:04.219
Come on, let's go.

13:05.747 --> 13:07.431
Kevin, Fangs.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.113
Save those eyes for the bedroom, boys.

13:09.116 --> 13:10.891
We're getting out of
this house of the devil.

13:10.894 --> 13:14.795
Cheryl, aren't you confined to
your room for helping Toni escape?

13:14.798 --> 13:17.714
Yeah, and suddenly you're
sounding a lot like Betty.

13:17.717 --> 13:18.998
Betty knew the score.

13:19.001 --> 13:21.242
Edgar Evernever is harvesting organs.

13:24.933 --> 13:26.675
Come with me.

13:26.677 --> 13:29.877
Betty told me exactly where Edgar
keeps his innards collection.

13:35.777 --> 13:38.044
Are you still seeing organs, Cheryl?

13:38.705 --> 13:39.987
What?

13:39.989 --> 13:41.948
Edgar must've moved them, or Evelyn did.

13:41.950 --> 13:44.450
Cheryl, we are getting ready to ascend.

13:44.452 --> 13:45.706
And you should, too.

13:46.697 --> 13:48.713
What if I get my hands
on irrefutable proof

13:48.715 --> 13:51.141
that Edgar Evernever is a
modern day Dr. Frankenstein?

13:51.143 --> 13:53.510
You know what? Sure.

13:53.512 --> 13:56.062
Then proof, Kevin, is
what you shall have.

14:07.567 --> 14:08.950
Where the hell are they?

14:21.173 --> 14:22.825
Who's there?

14:22.835 --> 14:24.227
Reveal thyself.

14:27.373 --> 14:29.290
I'm in no mood.

14:29.293 --> 14:30.685
I said who are...

14:43.720 --> 14:45.680
It's a Red Paladin card.

14:47.724 --> 14:49.684
Archie, this question's for you.

14:55.781 --> 14:59.024
"The Red Paladin must
conquer the grizzled beast.

14:59.027 --> 15:02.170
He must battle alone in
the Pit to save his home."

15:03.072 --> 15:05.197
What is a grizzled beast?

15:08.369 --> 15:09.475
Oh, crap.

15:10.455 --> 15:11.555
Not again.

15:25.219 --> 15:26.477
Archie.

15:26.479 --> 15:28.146
Don't do this.

15:28.148 --> 15:30.598
That guy is eight feet tall and jacked.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.058
It's just a fight.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.935
I've been fighting all year.

15:33.937 --> 15:36.896
Don't forget, I survived a
real bear attack, remember?

15:36.898 --> 15:38.940
If I don't make it,

15:38.942 --> 15:40.750
tell my mom and dad I love them.

15:40.752 --> 15:41.877
And you guys.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.502
Hey.

17:21.147 --> 17:22.352
Come here.

17:30.845 --> 17:33.071
Archie, are you sure you're okay?

17:34.348 --> 17:36.308
Apart from every inch of my body.

17:37.351 --> 17:39.035
What do we do now?

17:39.037 --> 17:40.686
We gotta keep moving.

17:40.688 --> 17:42.768
Penelope has already left us more clues.

17:44.332 --> 17:45.509
Come on.

17:47.361 --> 17:49.737
What troubles you, Sister Alice?

17:49.739 --> 17:51.593
I can't get in touch with Betty,

17:51.596 --> 17:55.229
and I'm hearing rumors.

17:55.232 --> 17:58.788
Whisperings about harvesting?

17:58.791 --> 18:00.306
I see.

18:02.376 --> 18:04.019
May I address your concerns?

18:08.900 --> 18:13.311
Unfortunately, there's
not much I can say

18:13.313 --> 18:15.572
about Betty or where she is.

18:16.983 --> 18:18.491
About the rumors...

18:20.436 --> 18:25.040
I admit, I have not
been entirely truthful

18:25.042 --> 18:28.367
about all the activities at the Farm.

18:28.369 --> 18:30.328
What kind of sick monster are you?

18:30.330 --> 18:31.953
Cheryl, I'm in a meeting.

18:31.956 --> 18:33.455
Please respect Sister Alice.

18:33.458 --> 18:37.388
Why? Why would you do such
a thing to my own brother?

18:38.861 --> 18:42.043
You had a void.

18:43.435 --> 18:46.511
It's my job to diagnose how to fill it.

18:46.513 --> 18:47.920
By grave-robbing?

18:47.922 --> 18:49.680
- Wait, what?
- Grab her.

18:49.682 --> 18:52.466
No! Get your hands off me!

18:52.468 --> 18:54.444
Confine Ms. Blossom to her room.

18:54.446 --> 18:55.928
You won't get away with this.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.096
Toni will come for me.

18:57.098 --> 18:58.689
Kevin's father is a lawman!

19:03.622 --> 19:06.105
Evelyn, Sister Alice,

19:06.107 --> 19:08.708
will you help me gather
our flock in the chamber?

19:10.619 --> 19:12.887
So that we may ascend with the...

19:28.212 --> 19:30.221
"The Fate and Fortune Challenge.

19:30.223 --> 19:31.815
Before you are six chalices,

19:31.817 --> 19:33.465
each filled with Gargoyle blood.

19:33.467 --> 19:37.136
The Enchantress must choose
her closest companion.

19:37.138 --> 19:39.346
They will each take
turns spinning the bottle

19:39.348 --> 19:42.641
and drinking from the chosen chalice.

19:42.643 --> 19:45.060
But beware, for one of
the chalices contains

19:45.062 --> 19:47.646
a lethal, rapid-acting venom."

19:47.648 --> 19:49.648
Seriously? Spin the bottle?

19:49.650 --> 19:50.850
More like Russian roulette.

19:52.245 --> 19:54.153
That's suicide. I refuse.

19:54.155 --> 19:56.822
"Refusal to participate in the challenge

19:56.824 --> 19:59.175
results in the immediate execution

19:59.177 --> 20:01.327
of all remaining party members.

20:01.329 --> 20:04.205
Remember, we're watching."

20:04.207 --> 20:07.758
Vee, the scroll says you have
to choose your closest companion.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.335
I volunteer.

20:09.337 --> 20:10.761
Betty, no.

20:10.763 --> 20:13.580
It's okay. I have faith.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.823
And what's the alternative? We
get shot in the woods by snipers?

20:21.849 --> 20:24.117
I'm having a diabolical
sense of deja vu.

20:44.487 --> 20:46.061
How do you feel?

20:46.064 --> 20:47.207
I think I'm fine.

21:06.435 --> 21:07.619
I'm okay, Vee.

21:47.026 --> 21:48.785
50-50 odds.

22:13.836 --> 22:15.219
Okay.

22:15.221 --> 22:16.271
No.

22:16.273 --> 22:17.873
- Vee.
- Veronica.

22:20.435 --> 22:22.352
Why did you do that?

22:22.355 --> 22:24.315
Because I love you, Bee.

22:25.222 --> 22:27.323
You're my best friend, and...

22:27.325 --> 22:28.658
I love you too, Vee.

22:32.630 --> 22:35.890
Remarkable, Enchantress.

22:35.893 --> 22:38.524
You've completed your challenge,

22:38.527 --> 22:40.486
and proven your loyalty.

22:40.488 --> 22:42.154
- What?
- What?

22:42.156 --> 22:45.532
Of course. It was a character challenge.

22:45.534 --> 22:47.993
The game was testing if
you had honor and loyalty.

22:47.995 --> 22:49.679
None of the chalices were poisoned.

22:49.681 --> 22:51.663
On the contrary,

22:51.665 --> 22:53.665
all of the chalices were poisoned.

22:54.761 --> 22:56.411
It's slow-acting,

22:56.413 --> 22:59.188
but the only way to obtain the
antidote is to finish the game,

22:59.190 --> 23:01.482
and even then, you might not make it.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.871
Tick tock.

23:23.627 --> 23:24.804
Hey.

23:28.536 --> 23:31.128
I need to say something.

23:31.130 --> 23:33.205
I don't know what's going
on with you and Reggie.

23:33.207 --> 23:34.683
He's my friend.

23:34.686 --> 23:36.225
But I love you.

23:38.471 --> 23:41.213
Veronica, I don't think
I've ever stopped loving you.

23:41.215 --> 23:42.297
Archie...

23:44.885 --> 23:46.152
The night of the fight,

23:47.888 --> 23:49.888
nothing happened with Reggie

23:49.890 --> 23:52.224
after you showed up at the Pembrooke.

23:52.226 --> 23:54.202
My heart ached for you...

23:55.655 --> 23:57.372
because I felt the same way.

24:01.444 --> 24:03.669
I love you, Archiekins.

24:05.075 --> 24:06.922
For whatever good that does us now.

24:06.925 --> 24:10.617
Hey, I'm not letting
you die tonight, okay?

24:10.619 --> 24:13.179
None of us dies tonight, I swear.

24:17.637 --> 24:18.793
Do you believe me?

24:45.192 --> 24:46.311
I'm warning you.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.048
Shh.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.324
What are you going to do to me?

24:50.326 --> 24:51.317
Nothing.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.434
I'm here to help you
escape. Hurry. Come with me.

24:53.437 --> 24:54.620
Why would I trust you?

24:54.622 --> 24:57.247
You're as brainwashed
as Patty Hearst was.

24:57.249 --> 24:58.516
What choice do you have?

25:04.131 --> 25:06.632
There's a tunnel down here
that leads to Fox Forest.

25:06.634 --> 25:09.801
I remember. But Betty
said it was bricked up.

25:09.803 --> 25:12.179
Edgar reopened it when
he bought the compound.

25:12.181 --> 25:14.657
Here, take Juniper,

25:14.659 --> 25:16.808
reunite her with Dagwood.

25:16.811 --> 25:19.144
Wait, what? Aren't you coming?

25:19.147 --> 25:21.330
I have to stay for Polly.

25:21.332 --> 25:25.692
But please, Cheryl, swear
to me you'll find Betty.

25:25.694 --> 25:28.153
Make sure she's safe from the Farm.

25:28.155 --> 25:29.914
From her father.

25:29.916 --> 25:31.928
- Please.
- I promise.

25:33.035 --> 25:34.844
Okay. Now go.

25:36.205 --> 25:38.285
Don't stop running
until you get to town.

25:44.171 --> 25:45.855
Wake up, child.

25:46.590 --> 25:48.191
Nana?

25:48.193 --> 25:50.676
What the hell is going on?

25:50.678 --> 25:52.770
There's no time, Antoinette.

25:52.772 --> 25:54.772
The hunt is afoot.

25:54.774 --> 25:57.015
What? What hunt?

25:57.017 --> 25:59.109
At the Thornhill Nature Preserve.

25:59.111 --> 26:02.371
Your school chums are the prey.

26:02.373 --> 26:04.540
You must save them.

26:04.542 --> 26:07.651
Look, I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.962
But first, I need to save Cheryl.

26:17.722 --> 26:19.096
You're up, Jug.

26:20.874 --> 26:23.041
"The Battle of Kings.

26:23.043 --> 26:25.937
Only one shall leave the
Kingdom of Eldervair."

27:05.393 --> 27:06.631
Why are you doing this?

27:07.272 --> 27:08.904
Why be the Gargoyle King?

27:09.923 --> 27:11.757
Who doesn't wanna be king?

27:11.759 --> 27:14.277
Who doesn't want blood
sacrifices made in their name?

27:14.279 --> 27:16.195
Wow. Okay.

27:34.799 --> 27:35.881
Jug!

27:57.638 --> 27:58.904
Are you okay?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.574
Jug.

28:03.903 --> 28:05.077
It's Penelope's poison.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.072
We gotta keep moving.

28:08.074 --> 28:09.277
Come on.

28:16.224 --> 28:18.082
Wait, I still don't get it.

28:18.084 --> 28:21.543
Chic got red hair because Penelope's
pretending that he's Jason Blossom?

28:21.545 --> 28:24.680
Can we explore the craziness
that is Oedipus Riverdale

28:24.682 --> 28:27.683
after we get the antidote
and out of these damn woods?

28:27.685 --> 28:30.225
Maybe figuring out how
all of this is connected

28:30.228 --> 28:32.061
is exactly what we should be doing.

28:32.064 --> 28:34.398
Hal, Penelope, Chic...

28:34.401 --> 28:36.359
They created this unholy trinity

28:36.361 --> 28:38.343
with direct links to everything bad

28:38.345 --> 28:40.971
that has happened in
the last three years.

28:40.973 --> 28:43.824
It's like Jason Blossom's
death begat the Black Hood,

28:43.827 --> 28:45.609
which begat the Gargoyle King.

28:45.611 --> 28:48.687
But the Gargoyle King existed
before Jason was killed.

28:48.689 --> 28:51.782
Then it's a case of a
serpent eating its own tail.

28:51.784 --> 28:54.884
It's a vicious cycle
of never-ending madness

28:54.887 --> 28:57.069
that turns back on
itself over and over again

28:57.072 --> 28:58.506
until someone breaks the chain.

29:07.216 --> 29:08.611
Toni.

29:08.614 --> 29:09.809
Baby?

29:18.736 --> 29:21.331
We were just coming to
save you from the Farm.

29:21.334 --> 29:23.600
- How'd you get out?
- An angel in disguise.

29:26.756 --> 29:27.868
Where's Betty?

29:27.870 --> 29:30.896
She's being hunted at Thornhill

29:30.898 --> 29:32.397
with all the others.

29:32.399 --> 29:33.741
What are you talking about, Nana?

29:33.743 --> 29:37.161
Your mother has been
preparing for this for weeks,

29:37.163 --> 29:38.491
if not months.

29:39.398 --> 29:42.239
It's the grand hunt.

29:42.242 --> 29:43.759
We have to go there.

29:43.761 --> 29:45.952
We have to save them.

29:45.954 --> 29:48.839
Poisons, Serpents, let's ride!

29:53.438 --> 29:55.337
Looks like it's my turn.

29:55.339 --> 29:56.486
Hey.

29:58.276 --> 29:59.400
I love you.

30:00.312 --> 30:01.653
I love you, too.

30:48.475 --> 30:50.117
You know how this has to end.

30:52.187 --> 30:54.020
You have to kill me, Betty.

30:54.022 --> 30:56.648
That's your heart, that's your truth.

30:56.650 --> 30:58.459
You can't deny your destiny.

31:01.172 --> 31:03.989
Don't make me do this, please.

31:03.991 --> 31:07.751
Either kill me and get the antidote,

31:07.753 --> 31:09.845
or I will kill you and your friends.

31:11.015 --> 31:12.975
You have till the count of three.

31:14.559 --> 31:16.519
Either shoot me or I'll shoot you.

31:22.193 --> 31:23.400
One...

31:27.106 --> 31:28.155
Two...

31:41.463 --> 31:42.545
Argh!

31:54.264 --> 31:56.723
I will never be like you, Dad.

31:57.562 --> 31:59.136
Enough!

31:59.138 --> 32:02.047
Good God, Hal.

32:02.049 --> 32:04.382
You can't be trusted to do anything.

32:04.384 --> 32:06.235
You were a terrible serial killer,

32:06.237 --> 32:07.978
and you still are today.

32:07.980 --> 32:09.646
Useless.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.237
And what do you think you're doing?

32:28.240 --> 32:29.898
Claiming our prize.

32:29.901 --> 32:31.677
We won, didn't we?

32:32.806 --> 32:34.046
We survived the night.

32:34.049 --> 32:36.169
We proved that we're
better than this town.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.351
That may or may not be true.

32:41.129 --> 32:42.535
Kill them.

32:42.538 --> 32:44.181
Kill them all!

32:44.183 --> 32:45.441
Come on. Archie!

33:06.279 --> 33:07.467
Archie!

33:09.675 --> 33:10.799
Take cover!

33:23.055 --> 33:24.146
Ronnie, here.

33:33.691 --> 33:35.658
Poisons, charge!

33:44.294 --> 33:45.417
All clear.

34:00.555 --> 34:02.000
Cheryl. Cheryl.

34:03.837 --> 34:06.046
Why aren't you at the
Farm? Where's my mom?

34:06.048 --> 34:08.840
She sprung me from that Jonestown-like
nightmare and told me to find you.

34:08.842 --> 34:10.266
Edgar was planning to ascend tonight.

34:10.268 --> 34:11.685
Oh, my God. We have to save her.

34:11.687 --> 34:12.768
Come aboard, cousin.

34:12.771 --> 34:13.913
Get in.

34:21.835 --> 34:22.955
Kevin.

34:25.208 --> 34:26.375
They left me.

34:28.918 --> 34:30.451
I wanted to go,

34:30.454 --> 34:33.876
but they said that someone had to
stay behind to explain what happened.

34:33.879 --> 34:35.300
What did happen?

34:35.302 --> 34:38.411
The worthy ascended, of course.

34:38.413 --> 34:39.755
Who did?

34:39.757 --> 34:41.748
Where's my mom and Polly?

34:41.750 --> 34:43.210
Gone.

34:43.213 --> 34:44.476
Everyone is.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.103
And we'll never see them again.

34:59.148 --> 35:01.453
The Gargoyle King.

35:01.456 --> 35:03.230
The Red Dahlia.

35:03.233 --> 35:05.080
The Black Hood.

35:06.024 --> 35:07.607
Chic was in jail.

35:07.609 --> 35:09.400
Hal Cooper was dead.

35:09.402 --> 35:11.253
Finally.

35:11.255 --> 35:13.738
Only Penelope Blossom
managed to slip away

35:13.740 --> 35:14.965
into the night.

35:16.284 --> 35:19.400
Riverdale belonged to us again.

35:19.403 --> 35:22.204
A future was ours to write.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.185
But what would our stories be?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.017
Welcome home, Jay-Jay.

35:47.533 --> 35:50.000
You're sure? How could
he have hid this from me?

35:50.002 --> 35:51.168
Hid what?

35:52.445 --> 35:53.754
I... I gotta go.

35:55.991 --> 35:58.449
Veronica, that was our attorney.

35:58.451 --> 36:00.418
What was Daddy hiding?

36:00.420 --> 36:01.516
FBI!

36:02.122 --> 36:03.997
Hands up, now.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.290
Agent Ardilla?

36:05.292 --> 36:06.799
What the hell is going on?

36:06.802 --> 36:09.669
Hermione Lodge, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

36:09.671 --> 36:11.087
Your own husband's.

36:11.089 --> 36:12.388
Veronica, listen to me.

36:12.391 --> 36:15.892
It's going to be fine. Call
Sowerberry. Talk to him.

36:15.894 --> 36:17.974
- I love you, mija.
- I love you, too, Mom.

36:23.894 --> 36:25.778
Mr. Lodge, it's done.

36:28.148 --> 36:30.949
As requested, your wife's been arrested.

36:30.951 --> 36:33.111
And the necessary
evidence has been planted.

36:34.046 --> 36:35.645
Perfect.

36:35.648 --> 36:37.005
Thank you.

36:40.827 --> 36:45.305
Ah, Veronica, you don't even
know what's coming, mija.

36:51.922 --> 36:53.658
Can we take five?

36:53.661 --> 36:55.953
Yeah, sure, Red.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.455
What's up?

37:02.457 --> 37:05.576
I've been thinking about making
some changes to this place, Mad Dog.

37:05.578 --> 37:07.694
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:07.696 --> 37:10.396
Maybe make it more than just a gym.

37:10.398 --> 37:13.069
Like a halfway house
or a community center.

37:13.072 --> 37:15.106
Place where the kids in
the neighborhood can come

37:15.109 --> 37:16.602
so they stay off the streets.

37:18.382 --> 37:19.864
I want you to help me run it.

37:19.866 --> 37:21.084
For real?

37:21.087 --> 37:23.243
We might actually have a shot
at turning this town around,

37:23.245 --> 37:24.219
give people hope again.

37:24.221 --> 37:25.296
Oh, yeah.

37:31.887 --> 37:33.128
Can I help you?

37:33.131 --> 37:34.538
Mr. Jones?

37:34.541 --> 37:36.255
I'm Agent Smith with the FBI.

37:36.258 --> 37:38.218
Is Betty Cooper here by any chance?

37:39.386 --> 37:40.977
Is this about the Lodges?

37:40.979 --> 37:43.488
No, it's about your mother.

37:44.687 --> 37:46.904
My team's been
investigating Edgar Evernever

37:46.907 --> 37:48.652
for quite some time now.

37:48.654 --> 37:50.320
We almost had him two towns ago.

37:50.322 --> 37:52.015
Well, what were you waiting for?

37:52.018 --> 37:55.532
He and his kooks took over The
Sisters of Quiet Mercy months ago.

37:55.535 --> 37:57.110
We had someone on the inside,

37:57.112 --> 37:59.112
someone tasked with
getting close to Edgar,

37:59.114 --> 38:00.589
gathering intel.

38:00.591 --> 38:02.214
We were waiting on her word.

38:03.835 --> 38:06.836
- "Her," you mean...
- Your mother.

38:06.838 --> 38:08.138
She's working with us.

38:11.268 --> 38:15.178
My mother? My mother
is an FBI informant?

38:15.180 --> 38:18.423
She's been helping us build a case
against Edgar Evernever and his Farmies,

38:18.425 --> 38:19.808
their organ harvesting, all of it.

38:19.810 --> 38:22.143
You knew about the organ harvesting.

38:22.145 --> 38:24.196
It's vital that we find your mom ASAP.

38:24.198 --> 38:27.140
Which is why my team and I are gonna
be setting up shop here in Riverdale

38:27.142 --> 38:29.693
until we can safely
locate and extract her.

38:29.695 --> 38:32.770
I mean, what... Is there
anything we can do to help?

38:32.772 --> 38:34.772
Thought you might ask.

38:34.774 --> 38:37.055
So you're quite the
detectives around these parts.

38:39.630 --> 38:42.383
I'm sorry, this is gonna seem weird,

38:42.386 --> 38:44.166
but do I... Do I know you?

38:47.120 --> 38:50.714
As a matter of fact, yes.

38:50.716 --> 38:54.167
It's no coincidence that your
mother and I found each other.

38:54.169 --> 38:55.477
You see, um...

38:58.173 --> 39:00.897
I'm Charles, your brother.

39:07.232 --> 39:10.308
You... You can't be.

39:11.236 --> 39:12.244
Wait.

39:13.841 --> 39:16.250
If you're Charles...

39:16.253 --> 39:18.690
You and I are also brothers, Jughead.

39:18.693 --> 39:19.822
That's right.

39:22.489 --> 39:24.581
Wait. Back up. Your brother's alive.

39:24.583 --> 39:25.924
And he's an FBI agent?

39:25.926 --> 39:27.992
It's our half-brother.

39:27.994 --> 39:29.660
And it's pretty crazy, right?

39:29.662 --> 39:32.681
Oh, and my mom is also
working for the FBI,

39:32.683 --> 39:34.257
undercover at the Farm.

39:34.259 --> 39:35.860
What?

39:35.863 --> 39:38.982
Actually, that kind of tracks.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.777
What about you, Vee?
Any word about your mom?

39:41.780 --> 39:43.966
She's trying to cut a deal with the DA,

39:43.968 --> 39:47.362
but in the meantime,
Smithers is my legal guardian.

39:48.774 --> 39:50.157
Guys, let's make a vow.

39:51.535 --> 39:53.434
Another one.

39:53.436 --> 39:55.895
We've got senior year
ahead of us. Let's enjoy it.

39:55.897 --> 39:58.189
Let's vow to be done with death cults,

39:58.191 --> 40:01.376
and murder mysteries, and gremlins.

40:02.737 --> 40:04.280
It's gargoyles.

40:04.283 --> 40:08.635
Our senior year could be the last time
we're all together in the same place.

40:08.646 --> 40:10.962
And I don't want to
let anything ruin that.

40:14.707 --> 40:15.807
Agreed.

40:16.635 --> 40:17.893
I'm in.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.377
I'm so in.

40:19.379 --> 40:20.970
Me too.

40:20.972 --> 40:24.716
Well, it sounds a little dull, but sure.

40:24.719 --> 40:26.403
Let's toast.

40:26.406 --> 40:27.877
To the future.

40:27.880 --> 40:31.646
_

40:36.229 --> 40:37.287
Archie.

40:38.908 --> 40:39.948
Archie.

40:41.089 --> 40:42.167
Archie.

40:44.446 --> 40:46.406
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

40:48.241 --> 40:49.758
We have to burn all of our clothes,

40:49.760 --> 40:52.094
including Jughead's beanie.

40:52.096 --> 40:55.366
We'll wash off the blood
in the swimming hole.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.815
After tonight,

40:57.818 --> 41:00.510
we never speak of this, ever.

41:00.512 --> 41:03.167
Not to each other, not to our parents.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.131
No one.

41:05.134 --> 41:07.609
We finish our senior year and graduate,

41:07.611 --> 41:09.302
and we'll go our separate ways.

41:09.304 --> 41:11.780
That is the only way
that we won't get caught.

41:17.454 --> 41:18.599
Do it.

41:36.122 --> 41:37.305
Friends forever.

41:38.642 --> 41:40.058
Friends forever.

41:55.476 --> 41:58.886
