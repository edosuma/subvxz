00:26.884 --> 00:28.668
Yes?

00:28.670 --> 00:31.171
I'm supposed to deliver some
tables and chairs to a party--

00:31.173 --> 00:33.523
it starts in about
an hour-- and my, uh,

00:33.525 --> 00:36.109
van broke down
just down the street.

00:36.111 --> 00:37.527
You want me to call triple-A?

00:37.529 --> 00:39.196
Actually, no. I need
to call my boss,

00:39.198 --> 00:40.614
but my cell is dead.

00:40.616 --> 00:42.032
I was hoping I could come in,

00:42.034 --> 00:43.516
maybe charge it
for a few minutes?

00:43.518 --> 00:46.853
Please? Look, if I
mess up this delivery,

00:46.855 --> 00:48.371
I'm in some
serious trouble.

00:48.373 --> 00:50.740
How about you give me
your boss's number?

00:50.742 --> 00:52.209
I'll call him for you.

00:52.211 --> 00:53.910
I just started today, actually.

00:53.912 --> 00:56.329
I-I don't know my boss's number
off the top of my head.

00:56.331 --> 00:58.698
I need to plug in my phone
so I can get it.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.034
Tell me the name of the company,
I'll call the office.

01:01.036 --> 01:02.502
It's after hours.
Nobody's gonna answer.

01:02.504 --> 01:04.054
Would you please
just open the door?

01:04.056 --> 01:05.388
I'm sorry, but I don't know you.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.706
I can't just let you in.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.374
Lady, come on!
I'm gonna lose my job.

01:08.376 --> 01:11.728
Please, just leave
before I call the cops.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.852
Yeah, Broome
Street and Ludlow.

01:51.854 --> 01:53.436
You'll send another van?

01:53.438 --> 01:55.856
Great, thanks.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.107
Talk about a Good Samaritan.

01:57.109 --> 01:59.643
Saved my ass.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.868
<i>And as he fled, the man</i>
<i>dropped his walking stick,</i>

02:07.870 --> 02:10.737
which the police later
mistook for a weapon.

02:10.739 --> 02:14.440
But he did so in order
to pick up the mongoose.

02:14.442 --> 02:16.776
Which was, of course,
responsible

02:16.778 --> 02:18.962
for the claw marks
I found at the crime scene.

02:18.964 --> 02:23.216
The mongoose, you see, was quite
key in identifying the man.

02:23.218 --> 02:24.784
He was a magician.

02:24.786 --> 02:26.636
The rodent, part of his act.

02:26.638 --> 02:28.838
Now, once I realized
the man's true connection

02:28.840 --> 02:32.242
to the colonel, it became
obvious to me, the latter hadn't

02:32.244 --> 02:33.510
been murdered after all.

02:33.512 --> 02:34.895
He'd merely succumbed

02:34.897 --> 02:37.764
to a heart attack,
after the appearance of a man

02:37.766 --> 02:41.151
he'd sentenced
to death so long ago.

02:42.236 --> 02:43.904
Again,

02:43.906 --> 02:47.324
my name is Sherlock,
and I am an addict.

02:50.579 --> 02:52.279
That was a morning
of firsts.

02:52.281 --> 02:54.748
First share I've ever heard
involving a mongoose.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.482
Really?

02:56.484 --> 02:59.336
It was also the first time you
ever contributed at a meeting.

02:59.338 --> 03:00.787
Why am I not
surprised

03:00.789 --> 03:02.339
it had nothing to do
with your drug history?

03:02.341 --> 03:04.541
Ah, you know, it seems
so expected, doesn't it?

03:04.543 --> 03:06.960
Talking about addiction at an
addiction support group meeting.

03:06.962 --> 03:09.012
Besides, the group seemed
particularly down today.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.597
The last thing

03:10.599 --> 03:12.665
they needed to hear
was another depressing share.

03:12.667 --> 03:15.001
Is that why you decided to take
the floor? To cheer everyone up?

03:15.003 --> 03:17.470
You know me, Watson.
People person.

03:25.196 --> 03:27.230
Hello.

03:29.233 --> 03:31.901
Uh... Sherlock?

03:31.903 --> 03:33.820
Can you come up here, please?

03:35.072 --> 03:36.373
Right now?

03:43.080 --> 03:44.381
Rhys.

03:44.383 --> 03:45.832
I, uh... I let
myself in.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.500
I still had the
key from last time.

03:47.502 --> 03:49.869
I tried calling, but
your number's changed.

03:49.871 --> 03:51.471
Oh, so you know
each other.

03:51.473 --> 03:53.089
That's almost
a relief.

03:53.091 --> 03:55.058
Something's wrong.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.893
Yeah. It's Emily.

03:56.895 --> 04:00.880
She's, uh...
she's been kidnapped.

04:00.882 --> 04:02.482
When was she taken?

04:02.484 --> 04:05.551
Well, a ransom demand
two days ago from her e-mail?

04:05.553 --> 04:07.553
Video or note?
A video.

04:07.555 --> 04:09.105
What are they
asking for?

04:09.107 --> 04:10.490
Clearly this is
very important,

04:10.492 --> 04:12.909
but do you think
that we could press pause

04:12.911 --> 04:15.495
until we are all clothed?

04:17.615 --> 04:19.783
Ah.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.921
Love a cup of tea,
if you've got some.

04:24.923 --> 04:26.673
Yeah.
Yeah. Right.

04:26.675 --> 04:29.292
Um, sorry.
This is my room.

04:32.798 --> 04:34.764
So, obviously,
he's an old friend.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.066
Who's Emily?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.801
His daughter.
She lives in New York.

04:37.803 --> 04:40.303
And for clarity's sake,
Rhys isn't an old friend.

04:40.305 --> 04:41.938
Well, not exactly.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.807
He's, uh, my former drug dealer.

05:08.481 --> 05:09.897
As you may have guessed,

05:09.899 --> 05:12.282
last time Rhys was here,
he stayed in your room.

05:12.784 --> 05:14.517
This was when you
were still using.

05:14.519 --> 05:16.319
Two months after
I got to New York,

05:16.321 --> 05:18.688
before I was carted
off to rehab.

05:18.690 --> 05:20.874
Let's talk about this.
What's to talk about?

05:20.876 --> 05:23.043
The daughter
of an old friend is in trouble.

05:23.045 --> 05:24.494
He's not just
an old friend.

05:24.496 --> 05:25.829
He's the man
who used to supply me

05:25.831 --> 05:27.530
with narcotics;
yes, I am well aware.

05:27.532 --> 05:29.916
Doesn't make his daughter
any less kidnapped.

05:29.918 --> 05:32.502
And it's worth noting,
he is an <i>ex-dealer,</i>

05:32.504 --> 05:35.538
just as I am
an <i>ex-junkie.</i>

05:35.540 --> 05:37.590
Two phoenixes risen
from the ashes.

05:37.592 --> 05:39.259
This isn't about
what he is now.

05:39.261 --> 05:41.377
It's about what he was
to you back then.

05:41.379 --> 05:43.212
You think he may be some sort
of trigger?

05:43.214 --> 05:46.649
On a giant gun filled with drugs
pointed at you, yes.

05:47.885 --> 05:50.386
You're right.
He <i>is</i> a trigger.

05:50.388 --> 05:52.572
The minute I laid eyes on him,

05:52.574 --> 05:55.241
my mind conjured images
of heroin bubbling in a spoon.

05:55.243 --> 05:56.559
I felt an undeniable,

05:56.561 --> 05:58.395
almost gravitational pull.

05:58.397 --> 06:01.397
Yet, as I've already mentioned,
I consider the man a friend.

06:01.399 --> 06:03.199
I will not be
turning him away.

06:03.201 --> 06:05.902
I appreciate your opinion
and your concern.

06:05.904 --> 06:07.504
But you mistake
the support group ethos

06:07.506 --> 06:08.922
for a complete system
for living.

06:08.924 --> 06:11.574
It is not. At least not
to a man like me.

06:11.576 --> 06:12.842
My sobriety

06:12.844 --> 06:13.793
is on one plane.

06:13.795 --> 06:15.095
The bonds I share with those

06:15.097 --> 06:16.880
I consider friends
is on quite another.

06:16.882 --> 06:19.182
You're just gonna have
to work a bit harder this week.

06:20.469 --> 06:22.102
Not interrupting, am I?

06:22.104 --> 06:24.087
Sorry again
about upstairs.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.855
I was...
Haven't quite had

06:25.857 --> 06:28.274
my head screwed on the last
couple of days, you know?

06:28.276 --> 06:29.943
Should've figured
you'd have a bird over.

06:29.945 --> 06:32.062
I'm not a bird. I live here.

06:33.147 --> 06:34.531
I'm entirely
sober now, Rhys.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.116
Miss Watson is
my companion.

06:36.118 --> 06:37.600
She keeps me from
resuming bad habits.

06:37.602 --> 06:40.036
Of which I am one.
I get it.

06:40.038 --> 06:42.405
In which case,
let me show you this video.

06:42.407 --> 06:45.041
If you can't help me,
I'll be on my way.

06:45.043 --> 06:47.627
I'll just get my tea.

06:50.464 --> 06:52.382
Your daughter's life boils down

06:52.384 --> 06:56.953
to two numbers:
$2.2 million, four days.

06:56.955 --> 06:59.288
If you don't pay in time,
she dies.

06:59.290 --> 07:04.344
If you involve the police
or the FBI, she dies.

07:04.346 --> 07:07.664
If you deviate
from my instructions in any way,

07:07.666 --> 07:09.015
she dies.

07:09.017 --> 07:10.483
I've left a phone for you

07:10.485 --> 07:12.468
at her apartment;
keep it with you.

07:12.470 --> 07:15.188
Wait for further instructions.

07:18.493 --> 07:21.694
I went to her place
as soon as I touched down.

07:21.696 --> 07:23.646
This is the cell phone.

07:23.648 --> 07:25.949
Looked like there'd been
a bit of a struggle.

07:25.951 --> 07:28.184
I was careful
not to touch it.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.253
I'm sorry to interrupt,

07:30.255 --> 07:34.207
but do you have
$2.2 million?

07:34.209 --> 07:37.760
In May of 2011,
Rhys stole exactly that amount

07:37.762 --> 07:39.429
from his Dominican suppliers.

07:39.431 --> 07:40.880
He's been hiding out
in Thailand ever since.

07:40.882 --> 07:42.832
Like I said, <i>ex-dealer.</i>

07:42.834 --> 07:45.835
They got sloppy
with some transactions.

07:45.837 --> 07:48.838
I saw an opportunity for
early retirement, and took it.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.640
It never occurred to you
that you might be

07:50.642 --> 07:51.724
putting your daughter in danger?

07:51.726 --> 07:53.009
Well, no one knew about Emily.

07:53.011 --> 07:55.612
But he knew 'cause
he deduced it.

07:55.614 --> 07:57.447
But I never spoke about
her to anyone else, never.

07:57.449 --> 07:59.199
Her mom knew, obviously, but...

07:59.201 --> 08:00.783
She passed away
several years ago.

08:00.785 --> 08:04.037
Did Emily know about your theft
from the Dominicans?

08:04.039 --> 08:07.323
No. Before I disappeared, I gave
her an e-mail address, and said,

08:07.325 --> 08:09.492
"Look, if you're ever in
trouble, you can get in touch,"

08:09.494 --> 08:12.045
but I hadn't heard from her
till I got this video.

08:12.047 --> 08:13.746
Well, isn't there
a simple solution?

08:13.748 --> 08:16.299
You pay the ransom,
and you get your daughter back.

08:17.869 --> 08:19.469
How much is left?

08:19.471 --> 08:22.889
Uh... just under two.

08:22.891 --> 08:24.591
$2 million
is nothing to sneeze at.

08:24.593 --> 08:27.093
$2,000, you know, give or take.

08:28.846 --> 08:31.547
You spent $2 million
in just 18 months?

08:31.549 --> 08:32.899
No, I lost $2 million.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.683
Drugs were his vice.

08:34.686 --> 08:37.337
Cards were mine. Look, I'm
sorry. I'm even sorrier

08:37.339 --> 08:40.389
now that I know that you're
trying to clean up. I just...

08:40.390 --> 08:42.725
I don't mean to go stirring up
bad memories. I just didn't know

08:42.727 --> 08:45.161
who else to turn to. Said
he'd kill Emily if I went

08:45.163 --> 08:46.496
to the cops or the feds.

08:46.498 --> 08:48.198
And I figured,
since I was acquainted

08:48.200 --> 08:51.000
with <i>the</i> Sherlock Holmes,
I'd be a fool not to...

08:51.002 --> 08:52.919
seek his advice, right

08:52.921 --> 08:56.956
We have just under 44 hours
until the ransom is due.

08:58.759 --> 09:00.043
Luxury.

09:00.045 --> 09:01.844
That's twice what I'll need.

09:14.608 --> 09:19.696
That's Emily's
mom... Penny.

09:19.698 --> 09:21.147
You said she passed away.

09:21.149 --> 09:22.982
Yeah, some kind of
cancer, I think.

09:23.951 --> 09:25.735
Well, we were
never that close.

09:25.737 --> 09:30.106
She was American on holiday
in London back in '91.

09:30.108 --> 09:33.042
We met, had some fun...
then along came Emily.

09:35.796 --> 09:38.164
How are you not
a total wreck right now?

09:38.166 --> 09:42.468
If my kid was taken
and held for ransom,

09:42.470 --> 09:45.638
I don't know
if I could keep it together.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.958
You seem quite...
I don't know-- Zen.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.761
Huh.

09:51.763 --> 09:54.647
I made a delivery once to
Holmes at Scotland Yard.

09:54.649 --> 09:56.399
Crazy, right?

09:56.401 --> 09:58.634
Crazier still,

09:58.636 --> 10:00.970
he invites me to stay
and watch him assist

10:00.972 --> 10:02.855
in the interrogation
of this lunatic

10:02.857 --> 10:04.657
who'd been planting car
bombs all over the city.

10:04.659 --> 10:07.110
The police knew there was
another one out there,

10:07.112 --> 10:08.828
but they didn't
know where it was.

10:08.830 --> 10:11.114
Holmes is in the room with the
guy for, like, five minutes.

10:11.116 --> 10:12.665
Figures out
where the bomb is

10:12.667 --> 10:14.284
from a couple of stains
on the guy's shoe.

10:14.286 --> 10:17.420
You ask why I'm
not a total wreck?

10:17.422 --> 10:20.290
'Cause I believe
in Sherlock Holmes.

10:20.292 --> 10:21.958
Your friends,
the Dominicans-- they were here.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.127
Or at least
one of them was, anyway.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.097
He waited for her here.

10:28.099 --> 10:30.383
I found traces
of cigarette ash on the floor.

10:30.385 --> 10:33.436
Now, how do I know
it didn't come from Emily? Easy.

10:33.438 --> 10:36.672
She's not a smoker. No
other signs of tobacco

10:36.674 --> 10:39.058
in the whole apartment. She
doesn't even have a lighter.

10:39.060 --> 10:42.362
This ash comes from a Crema,
a popular Dominican brand.

10:42.364 --> 10:44.180
You can tell the brand
by the ash?

10:44.182 --> 10:45.531
I can identify 140 cigarette

10:45.533 --> 10:47.317
and cigar brands
by their ash alone.

10:47.319 --> 10:49.068
Now, if you bothered
to read my monographs,

10:49.070 --> 10:50.486
you would know that.

10:50.488 --> 10:52.238
So, they
struggled here.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.123
She dropped her glass
of water that she poured.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.359
The water spilled
on his hand.

10:56.361 --> 10:58.244
How else do you explain this?

11:00.547 --> 11:02.665
It's just a swirl.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.300
It is a symbol,

11:04.302 --> 11:06.886
that of the Taino god
of hurricanes.

11:06.888 --> 11:09.705
The Taino, as everyone knows,
were the pre-Colombian

11:09.707 --> 11:11.924
inhabitants of what is now
the Dominican Republic.

11:11.926 --> 11:14.761
This, meanwhile, is a hand stamp

11:14.763 --> 11:16.846
of a Dominican nightclub
in Brooklyn

11:16.848 --> 11:20.233
called, appropriately enough,
Hurrikane, with a "K."

11:20.235 --> 11:22.035
<i>Emily's water moistened</i>
<i>the hand stamp</i>

11:22.037 --> 11:24.821
<i>on her abductor's hand,</i>
<i>facilitating its transfer</i>

11:24.823 --> 11:26.389
to the wall.

11:26.391 --> 11:28.541
Maybe he left some prints.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.860
Already checked-- he wiped down
the doorknobs before he left.

11:30.862 --> 11:32.862
How do you know the stamp
didn't come from Emily's hand?

11:32.864 --> 11:35.698
Well, she'd just got back
from a jog, hence the water.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.867
No nightclub would allow her in
wearing exercise gear,

11:37.869 --> 11:40.420
let alone one as pretentious
as Hurrikane with a "K."

11:40.422 --> 11:42.338
Her kidnapper came
from a nightclub,

11:42.340 --> 11:44.507
and that is where we shall go.

11:45.259 --> 11:47.794
"I believe in Sherlock Holmes."

11:58.055 --> 11:59.889
This is seriously
the plan?

11:59.891 --> 12:02.275
Rhys walks around
on the off chance

12:02.277 --> 12:05.361
he recognizes someone
before they recognize him?

12:05.363 --> 12:08.231
Well, he's wearing a hat.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.904
Are there other, more surgical
ways to search this nightclub?

12:14.906 --> 12:16.456
Yes, of course, but
they would require

12:16.458 --> 12:19.492
the manpower and resources
of an NYPD or an FBI,

12:19.494 --> 12:20.993
and both are
off-limits to us.

12:20.995 --> 12:22.378
But if he spots someone

12:22.380 --> 12:24.297
from his days dealing
with the cartel,

12:24.299 --> 12:25.965
we'll follow them.

12:30.804 --> 12:32.972
You seem even more dour
than usual, Watson.

12:32.974 --> 12:35.308
I would posit it was
a menstruation issue,

12:35.310 --> 12:38.094
but I worked out your cycle--
you're good for ten more days.

12:38.096 --> 12:40.062
Couching it as
a scientific observation

12:40.064 --> 12:41.964
totally negates the misogyny.

12:41.966 --> 12:43.766
And for the record,
I'm not happy

12:43.768 --> 12:46.402
because we are in a nightclub
surrounded by alcohol,

12:46.404 --> 12:48.738
and-and, judging by the way
people are dancing,

12:48.740 --> 12:50.306
serious drugs.

12:50.308 --> 12:53.276
Told you it was gonna be
a difficult few days.

12:53.278 --> 12:54.643
Okay,

12:54.645 --> 12:56.446
over in the corner,
the VIP area,

12:56.448 --> 12:58.865
see the big guy in there
with a beard?

12:58.867 --> 13:01.417
Right?
His name's Reynaldo.

13:01.419 --> 13:03.369
He's one of
the U.K. suppliers.

13:03.371 --> 13:05.755
Is he the one you stole from?
Technically, I stole from them all,

13:05.757 --> 13:07.823
but, yeah, he'd be
pretty upset with me.

13:07.825 --> 13:09.292
So, obviously,
more than a coincidence--

13:09.294 --> 13:11.494
a man you stole from
sitting in a nightclub

13:11.496 --> 13:14.663
that Emily's abductor was in
just before she was taken.

13:14.665 --> 13:17.350
So what do
we do now?

13:17.352 --> 13:18.834
Now...

13:18.836 --> 13:21.270
I urinate.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.950
Nice tats.

13:35.319 --> 13:37.620
My name is Sherlock Holmes--
I'm a consultant

13:37.622 --> 13:39.572
with the NYPD. I'm looking for a
kidnapping victim.

13:39.574 --> 13:41.958
Her name is Emily Grant.
I believe that your friend Reynaldo

13:41.960 --> 13:43.008
may be responsible.

13:43.033 --> 13:44.962
Would you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

13:46.581 --> 13:48.080
No hablo inglés.

13:48.082 --> 13:50.049
That's strange.

13:50.051 --> 13:51.834
I'm fairly certain
that English...

13:51.836 --> 13:54.003
is a requirement for agents

13:54.005 --> 13:56.372
of the DEA-- even
those deep undercover

13:56.374 --> 13:58.007
in Dominican
drug cartels. Hmm?

13:58.009 --> 13:59.875
What gave you
away, you ask?

13:59.877 --> 14:02.094
Well, first it was
your tradecraft.

14:02.096 --> 14:04.013
<i>Out there, you used</i>
<i>the nearest champagne bucket</i>

14:04.015 --> 14:05.714
<i>to monitor your surroundings</i>
<i>behind you without turning</i>

14:05.716 --> 14:07.716
your head-- that's not
a technique one learns

14:07.718 --> 14:10.052
on the street, but at Quantico.
Then there are

14:10.054 --> 14:12.905
<i>your tattoos--</i>
<i>they're all perfectly thuggish,</i>

14:12.907 --> 14:14.657
all precisely
the same age.

14:14.659 --> 14:16.659
Most tattoos are
acquired over time.

14:16.661 --> 14:17.944
Hmm? Each emblem

14:17.946 --> 14:19.662
fades and ages
differently-- not yours.

14:19.664 --> 14:22.081
Yours would seem to suggest
you were in a hurry

14:22.083 --> 14:24.750
to fit in with a new crowd.

14:24.752 --> 14:27.286
Please, I have no interest
in jeopardizing your operation,

14:27.288 --> 14:29.205
but a woman's life is at stake,

14:29.207 --> 14:31.958
and given that you are a federal agent...
Call me a fed again,

14:31.960 --> 14:34.093
I'll cut out your tongue
and feed it to you.

14:34.095 --> 14:35.761
Well, perhaps your friends
in the VIP area

14:35.763 --> 14:37.930
will be more interested
in what I have to say.

14:37.932 --> 14:40.850
My boys love hearing
about the DEA.

14:40.852 --> 14:42.969
Like waving red
at a bull.

14:42.971 --> 14:45.137
Olé!

14:57.618 --> 14:58.934
It's okay.

14:58.936 --> 15:00.953
Guy tried to steal
my wallet, man!

15:01.955 --> 15:03.990
Stay, please.
Just stay, stay, stay.

15:05.827 --> 15:07.460
Stay out of it.

15:07.462 --> 15:09.629
You didn't give me any choice--
I'm in too deep,

15:09.631 --> 15:10.963
and I cannot let you
blow my cover.

15:10.965 --> 15:12.781
I just need to know
where to find the girl.

15:14.168 --> 15:16.118
Nobody in this organization
has kidnapped anyone

15:16.120 --> 15:17.420
in New York, trust me.

15:17.422 --> 15:19.839
Reynaldo over there, he <i>is</i>

15:19.841 --> 15:23.292
the cartel in New York-- nothing
happens without his say-so.

15:23.294 --> 15:25.127
The only thing he
cares about right now

15:25.129 --> 15:26.929
is the turf war
with the Colombians.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.931
I'm sorry, but you
may be looking into

15:28.933 --> 15:31.517
the one crime in this city
the cartel isn't behind.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.205
Suffocatingly inane.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.274
Good morning.

15:51.676 --> 15:54.994
This is soul-crushing
in its utter banality.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.595
Sufficiently asinine
as to constitute

15:56.597 --> 15:58.431
a valid argument
for eugenics.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.933
Okay, I give up.

16:00.935 --> 16:03.001
What are you reading?

16:03.003 --> 16:05.003
Emily's Twitter feed.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.273
Excruciating medium.

16:07.275 --> 16:11.394
Demonstrates that brevity does
not protect against dullness.

16:11.396 --> 16:13.312
That said, it does serve

16:13.314 --> 16:15.514
as a modern-day equivalent
of a diary,

16:15.516 --> 16:18.818
so who's to say
it won't turn up a suspect?

16:18.820 --> 16:20.369
So you've given up
on the cartel.

16:20.371 --> 16:22.020
For now, yes.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.774
Though the ash and ink stain
I found does suggest to me

16:24.776 --> 16:26.625
that Emily's abductor
<i>was</i> in that nightclub

16:26.627 --> 16:28.210
before he took her.

16:28.212 --> 16:31.080
Well, we have
an appointment at noon.

16:31.082 --> 16:33.416
So plan your hunt
around that.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.801
No. We visited the house
of bromides yesterday.

16:35.803 --> 16:37.670
I am no longer required
to supplicate

16:37.672 --> 16:39.588
at the altar of
recovery every day.

16:39.590 --> 16:42.258
You are when your ex-drug dealer
is living with us.

16:42.260 --> 16:45.094
So you wanted me to work harder;
this is working harder.

16:45.096 --> 16:48.147
Fine. I suppose they
might find the case

16:48.149 --> 16:50.232
of the blue carbuncle
entertaining.

16:50.234 --> 16:52.435
No, you're not gonna talk
about some old case.

16:52.437 --> 16:54.437
You're gonna share
something real about your...

16:56.022 --> 16:58.607
Mm, he really got you, huh?

16:58.609 --> 17:01.727
The man had a cover to protect;
I hold nothing against him.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.163
I'm gonna put some
antiseptic on that.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.073
Hey, I need to get in there.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.159
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'll be right there.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.961
Two shakes.

17:24.351 --> 17:26.551
It's all yours.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.105
You're kidding me,

17:29.107 --> 17:30.189
right?

17:30.191 --> 17:31.607
I'm a sober companion.

17:31.609 --> 17:33.809
You're in the home
of a recovering addict.

17:33.811 --> 17:36.112
I opened the window.
You don't do drugs here.

17:36.114 --> 17:38.063
That's not drugs; it's just
a little bit of wacky backy.

17:38.065 --> 17:39.532
I mean, my daughter's
been kidnapped,

17:39.534 --> 17:42.284
and I am under a bit
of strain right now.

17:42.286 --> 17:44.737
I'm gonna do you the favor of
believing you're just an idiot.

17:44.739 --> 17:46.405
Okay. Thank you.

17:46.407 --> 17:47.957
Hey, I'm not
finished yet.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.075
As much as I want you to
get your daughter back,

17:50.077 --> 17:51.410
I need you to
understand--

17:51.412 --> 17:53.212
Sherlock is my
number one priority.

17:53.214 --> 17:55.714
So you will not do
drugs in his house,

17:55.716 --> 17:57.299
you will not talk
to him about this,

17:57.301 --> 17:59.284
and you will not talk about
drugs in his presence.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.303
If I feel that you've
compromised his sobriety

18:01.305 --> 18:03.973
in any way, I will turn
you in to the police

18:03.975 --> 18:06.008
as a drug dealer
and a thief.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.460
Are we clear?

18:11.481 --> 18:13.015
Now give me the drugs.

18:13.017 --> 18:15.133
Watson! Rhys!

18:15.135 --> 18:17.520
Come along if you're
coming along!

18:23.326 --> 18:24.860
Is that it?

18:29.649 --> 18:32.150
We'll have to go
to an evening meeting, Watson.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.203
My time wading
in the cesspool of social media

18:34.205 --> 18:35.421
was not a complete waste.

18:35.423 --> 18:36.956
What did you find?

18:36.958 --> 18:38.591
Emily made
a curious Twitter entry

18:38.593 --> 18:40.292
under the hashtag:
"that awkward moment."

18:40.294 --> 18:41.927
Apparently,
it is a category

18:41.929 --> 18:44.380
for documenting uncomfortable
social experiences.

18:44.382 --> 18:46.298
Emily's read:
"When the man who used

18:46.300 --> 18:49.101
to give you your allowance
comes to you for a loan."

18:49.103 --> 18:50.519
Well, I never gave her
an allowance.

18:50.521 --> 18:52.354
She was talking
about her stepfather.

18:52.356 --> 18:53.355
Now, I cracked

18:53.357 --> 18:54.356
her banking password--

18:54.358 --> 18:55.357
your full name, by the way--

18:55.359 --> 18:56.508
and I accessed
her records.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.509
Seems she wrote

18:57.511 --> 18:58.527
a series of checks

18:58.529 --> 18:59.695
to a man called Derrick Hughes.

18:59.697 --> 19:01.447
That is her stepdad,
but he's big

19:01.449 --> 19:02.982
in real estate--
man, he's loaded.

19:02.984 --> 19:04.349
If he's rich, then
why would he have

19:04.351 --> 19:05.831
to borrow money from
his stepdaughter?

19:07.237 --> 19:08.687
What...

19:08.689 --> 19:10.789
Well, according to my friend
in the D.A. squad,

19:10.791 --> 19:12.524
<i>Derrick Hughes</i>
<i>had all kinds of money--</i>

19:12.526 --> 19:14.359
emphasis on "had."

19:14.361 --> 19:16.078
<i>Now, after the crash in '08,</i>

19:16.080 --> 19:18.080
<i>banks foreclosed</i>
<i>on most of his properties.</i>

19:18.082 --> 19:20.716
<i>Now, guy doesn't have</i>
<i>a criminal record, but...</i>

19:20.718 --> 19:22.574
he is dead broke.

19:22.674 --> 19:23.619
Thank you, Detective.

19:23.644 --> 19:25.371
Please let me know when
I can return the favor.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.890
How about you just tell me why
you're interested in the guy.

19:29.926 --> 19:32.678
Course not.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.981
So, Derrick Hughes
has motive to kidnap Emily.

19:35.983 --> 19:37.766
He's desperate for money.

19:37.768 --> 19:39.602
Reduced to working
as a parking attendant.

19:39.604 --> 19:41.937
If she confided in him
about your thievery,

19:41.939 --> 19:44.556
maybe he saw it as
a solution to his problems.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.775
Never liked the guy.

19:46.777 --> 19:49.227
I never met him,
but still.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.496
So what are we supposed to do?

19:50.498 --> 19:51.563
We supposed to just wait here

19:51.565 --> 19:52.865
until he
gets off work?

19:52.867 --> 19:55.284
Well, if he has her,
he will go to her.

19:55.286 --> 19:57.503
Well, I'm gonna
order some food,

19:57.505 --> 20:00.289
and maybe they'll
turn on the heat.

20:04.561 --> 20:06.679
You're doing good, man.

20:06.681 --> 20:09.098
It's nice to see you.
I'm proud of you.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.116
Must be like...
trying to relearn

20:11.118 --> 20:13.686
the piano after
a stroke, huh?

20:13.688 --> 20:16.421
What must be like trying
to relearn the piano?

20:16.423 --> 20:18.724
Well, doing what you
do without the...

20:18.726 --> 20:20.859
the drugs.

20:20.861 --> 20:23.412
Ridiculous. Detective work
is a deductive science.

20:23.414 --> 20:25.781
Drugs are a hindrance
to that, not a help.

20:25.783 --> 20:27.399
Yeah, but
there's, like,

20:27.401 --> 20:29.068
two parts to what
you do, isn't there?

20:29.070 --> 20:31.070
I mean, there's the
"knowing stuff" part--

20:31.072 --> 20:33.289
and you've got that
covered-- and then there's

20:33.291 --> 20:34.740
the making connections.

20:34.742 --> 20:37.293
That's, like, the-the...
the creative part.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.744
The art, right?

20:38.746 --> 20:41.113
I suppose so.
Some artists,

20:41.115 --> 20:44.466
they need the drugs
to fuel the creative stuff.

20:44.468 --> 20:46.135
Are you suggesting
that I was

20:46.137 --> 20:48.170
a better detective
when I was high?

20:48.172 --> 20:50.139
No, no, not exactly.

20:50.141 --> 20:52.808
It's just, well, there'd be
no shame in it, would there?

20:52.810 --> 20:54.977
I mean, the Stones
never made a decent album

20:54.979 --> 20:57.313
after they cleaned up,
and look at them.

20:57.315 --> 20:59.682
Just, it must be hard,
that's all.

20:59.684 --> 21:02.101
Is everything okay?

21:02.103 --> 21:03.819
Yeah. Why
wouldn't it be?

21:03.821 --> 21:06.322
Because Derrick Hughes
is getting off work

21:06.324 --> 21:09.241
and you guys are
just sitting here.

21:19.318 --> 21:21.486
Public records indicate

21:21.488 --> 21:23.339
that this is one
of several buildings

21:23.341 --> 21:25.323
that he bought in the area.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.760
Apparently, he made
a rather large bet

21:27.762 --> 21:30.212
that the area would gentrify.

21:30.214 --> 21:31.380
Bad investment.

21:31.382 --> 21:32.965
Well, not entirely.

21:32.967 --> 21:35.184
He came out of it with
a perfectly good place

21:35.186 --> 21:36.552
to hide a
kidnapped girl.

21:36.554 --> 21:38.187
You think he's got
Emily in there?

21:38.189 --> 21:39.521
I'd like to know why he

21:39.523 --> 21:42.507
brought groceries to
an abandoned building.

21:48.064 --> 21:50.232
Where'd he go?

21:50.234 --> 21:52.651
What is this place?

21:54.204 --> 21:56.538
I can explain.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.457
It's just for a few days.

21:58.459 --> 22:00.793
What's just for a few days?
Where is she?

22:00.795 --> 22:01.860
Where's who?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.662
Emily. Where are
you hiding her?

22:03.664 --> 22:05.164
My daughter?

22:05.166 --> 22:07.883
You people aren't with
the Housing Authority?

22:07.885 --> 22:09.585
She's not
your daughter!

22:09.587 --> 22:11.670
Mr. Hughes, my name
is Sherlock Holmes.

22:11.672 --> 22:13.138
I'm a consultant
with the NYPD.

22:13.140 --> 22:14.807
This is Joan Watson;
she's my associate.

22:14.809 --> 22:16.759
This...
Yeah, I've seen his face in pictures.

22:16.761 --> 22:18.343
You're Rhys.

22:18.345 --> 22:20.596
That's right,
and I'm here to take Emily home.

22:20.598 --> 22:21.980
Uh, Rhys...

22:21.982 --> 22:24.066
the groceries
were not for her.

22:24.068 --> 22:25.567
Mr. Hughes is
squatting here.

22:25.569 --> 22:27.019
Technically,

22:27.021 --> 22:28.654
I still own the place.

22:28.656 --> 22:30.055
What happened to Emily?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.907
She was kidnapped,
Mr. Hughes.

22:31.909 --> 22:33.942
Oh, my God.

22:33.944 --> 22:36.561
Emily...

22:36.563 --> 22:39.231
What, you thought I did it?

22:39.233 --> 22:41.083
Look around all you want.

22:41.085 --> 22:43.401
Ask me any questions you want.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.370
I raised her.
I would never hurt her.

22:45.372 --> 22:46.438
You took money from her.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.423
Yeah, I'm in a pinch.

22:47.425 --> 22:48.573
She helped me out.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.708
You haven't been
to a nightclub

22:49.710 --> 22:51.126
called Hurrikane
by any chance

22:51.128 --> 22:52.261
this week, have you?

22:52.263 --> 22:53.578
Uh, no.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.130
I've never even heard of it.

22:55.132 --> 22:56.882
I say he's lying.

22:56.884 --> 22:59.435
Do I look like a guy that's
been going to nightclubs much?

22:59.437 --> 23:00.752
Sorry to have
troubled you, Mr. Hughes.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.187
We'll be in touch.

23:05.876 --> 23:07.926
You could have let me
rough him up a bit.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.928
The man's body language
spoke volumes.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.596
He fairly reeked
of innocence.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.234
Hey, hey.

23:16.119 --> 23:18.103
Hello.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.105
Did you think
I wouldn't be watching?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.373
Wait, what?

23:21.375 --> 23:23.158
I told you
not to involve the police.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.626
Who are you working with?

23:24.628 --> 23:26.444
N-No, he, uh,
he isn't the police, he...

23:26.446 --> 23:28.297
I assure you,
I am not the police.

23:28.299 --> 23:30.883
I'm a friend,
an independent mediator.

23:30.885 --> 23:32.668
You just cost yourself 12 hours.

23:32.670 --> 23:35.804
I want the money by 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow, or she's dead.

23:35.806 --> 23:38.006
And to ensure
we all understand each other,

23:38.008 --> 23:39.174
I've left you something.

23:39.176 --> 23:41.093
It's outside your kitchen door.

23:57.243 --> 23:59.278
Oh, my God.

24:12.273 --> 24:14.223
You sure it's Emily's?

24:15.235 --> 24:16.991
I, uh, I compared
the fingerprint

24:16.993 --> 24:18.676
with ones I lifted
from Emily's cell phone.

24:18.678 --> 24:20.378
The finger is hers.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.381
Well, was hers, anyway.

24:23.383 --> 24:24.916
You have surveillance cameras
inside the house.

24:24.918 --> 24:26.284
Do you have any outside?

24:26.286 --> 24:28.503
Only one. It covers
the garden level door,

24:28.505 --> 24:30.321
and the kidnapper
never came squarely into view.

24:30.323 --> 24:32.507
Good news is,
Emily's severed digit

24:32.509 --> 24:35.193
may provide a clue
as to her location.

24:35.195 --> 24:36.778
Please.

24:45.538 --> 24:47.605
Looks like a burn.
It <i>is</i> a burn.

24:47.607 --> 24:49.257
Quite a distinctive burn,
as a matter of fact.

24:49.259 --> 24:52.243
It matches a floral design
found on a cast-iron radiator

24:52.245 --> 24:53.711
forged at the turn
of the century.

24:53.713 --> 24:56.581
Suggests she is
in a pre-war building.

24:56.583 --> 24:58.132
<i>She's likely been chained</i>
<i>to the radiator,</i>

24:58.134 --> 24:59.250
hence the burn.

24:59.252 --> 25:02.220
Now, look under
the fingernail.

25:05.374 --> 25:06.758
Ethiopian <i>wat.</i>

25:06.760 --> 25:08.676
Spiced onion-based stew.

25:08.678 --> 25:10.979
You can tell that
just by looking at it?

25:10.981 --> 25:12.480
No, I can tell it
by tasting it.

25:12.482 --> 25:13.765
It's unlikely her abductor
is preparing

25:13.767 --> 25:15.517
elaborate ethnic meals
for her himself,

25:15.519 --> 25:18.069
so let's assume the <i>wat</i>
is of the takeout variety.

25:18.071 --> 25:19.771
Now, if the restaurant

25:19.773 --> 25:21.523
is in the vicinity
of the kidnapper's lair,

25:21.525 --> 25:24.108
I can use historical
building permits to identify

25:24.110 --> 25:25.910
pre-war structures.
I then cross-reference

25:25.912 --> 25:27.061
those addresses
with those of every

25:27.063 --> 25:28.413
Ethiopian place in the city.

25:28.415 --> 25:30.231
Provided the selection's
narrow enough,

25:30.233 --> 25:33.284
I should be able to determine
which building is housing Emily.

25:33.286 --> 25:35.837
What about you?

25:35.839 --> 25:37.905
How are you doing?

25:37.907 --> 25:39.591
If you're asking if
I'm on the verge of a relapse,

25:39.593 --> 25:41.426
the answer is
a definitive "no."

25:41.428 --> 25:44.963
Well, you just seem a
little, uh, intense.

25:44.965 --> 25:46.598
Well, we are
on deadline, hmm?

25:46.600 --> 25:48.266
Would you mind going downstairs
and checking on Rhys?

25:48.268 --> 25:49.767
He went down there
37 minutes ago.

25:49.769 --> 25:51.436
I've heard nary
a floorboard creak since.

25:51.438 --> 25:55.106
A long time for someone of his
disposition to go motionless.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.068
Habesha.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.324
Brought you some tea.

26:15.544 --> 26:17.378
How are you doing?

26:19.215 --> 26:23.217
Well, I'd like to say
fine and dandy, but....

26:23.219 --> 26:27.005
just saw a piece
of my little girl in a box.

26:29.091 --> 26:30.758
How about you?

26:30.760 --> 26:34.228
Um, Sherlock's just
examining the...

26:34.230 --> 26:36.314
the package that
we received.

26:36.316 --> 26:40.518
He thinks it might be able
to help him locate Emily.

26:40.520 --> 26:45.523
He thinks it might
be able to help him.

26:45.525 --> 26:48.276
That doesn't sound like
the Sherlock I used to know.

26:48.278 --> 26:50.578
He just needs a little
more time, that's all.

26:50.580 --> 26:53.331
I need some air.

26:54.650 --> 26:56.584
Rhys, for what
it's worth...

26:58.504 --> 27:01.172
...I believe
in Sherlock Holmes, too,

27:07.379 --> 27:10.331
If you involve
the police or the FBI, she dies.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.350
If you deviate
from my instructions

27:12.352 --> 27:14.669
in any way, she dies.

27:14.671 --> 27:17.338
I've left a phone
for you at her apartment;

27:17.340 --> 27:18.506
keep it with you.

27:18.508 --> 27:20.208
Wait for further instructions.

27:21.527 --> 27:25.196
Your daughter's life
boils down to two numbers:

27:25.198 --> 27:28.616
$2.2 million, four days.

27:35.692 --> 27:37.358
How we doing?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.694
I thought I was on to
something with the finger--

27:39.696 --> 27:41.045
the connection
between pre-war buildings

27:41.047 --> 27:42.630
and Ethiopian restaurants--

27:42.632 --> 27:45.216
but it turns out there are
too many of both of those

27:45.218 --> 27:46.884
to be helpful,
so I'm revisiting

27:46.886 --> 27:49.053
the ransom video.

27:49.055 --> 27:50.338
See if there's a detail,

27:50.340 --> 27:51.556
a clue to her whereabouts

27:51.558 --> 27:52.974
that I might have missed
the first time.

27:52.976 --> 27:55.643
Light, shadow,
noises in the background,

27:55.645 --> 27:56.844
reflection in the cornea--

27:56.846 --> 27:58.346
any tiny detail
could be the key.

27:58.348 --> 28:01.432
Do you remember the...
Tinsdale case?

28:01.434 --> 28:03.184
That security nut.

28:03.186 --> 28:05.386
Had more alarms in his house
than he had doors.

28:05.388 --> 28:07.722
Used to lock himself in
his bedroom every night.

28:07.724 --> 28:09.574
Died in his sleep.
Suffocated.

28:09.576 --> 28:11.275
You were sure it was murder,
but there was no evidence

28:11.277 --> 28:12.326
anyone else had been inside.

28:12.328 --> 28:15.463
Huh?

28:17.733 --> 28:21.335
I remember, uh...
I remember I brought you

28:21.337 --> 28:23.404
a little cocaine,
watched you shoot up.

28:23.406 --> 28:26.874
Like, within a minute,
you had the whole thing sussed.

28:26.876 --> 28:31.596
It was the maid; she'd left
some dry ice under his bed.

28:31.598 --> 28:33.598
And then it evaporated,
turned to carbon dioxide.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.916
He died in his sleep, no
one was any the wiser.

28:35.918 --> 28:36.917
Except you,

28:36.919 --> 28:38.436
of course.

28:38.438 --> 28:40.972
Remember?

28:52.201 --> 28:54.285
It's time, huh?

28:54.287 --> 28:55.870
For Emily.

29:10.135 --> 29:11.586
Why would you do that?

29:11.588 --> 29:13.054
You've needed it
the last two days!

29:13.056 --> 29:15.456
I assure you, I have not!

29:15.458 --> 29:16.791
Have you listened
to yourself?

29:16.793 --> 29:18.593
The rubbish you've
been spouting?

29:18.595 --> 29:21.979
Huh? About lights and shadows
and reflections and corneas.

29:21.981 --> 29:23.564
That's not you,
that's not Sherlock Holmes.

29:23.566 --> 29:25.900
This is some ghost of
you, some pale imitation.

29:25.902 --> 29:27.185
You need your meds.

29:27.187 --> 29:28.820
Get yourself right.

29:28.822 --> 29:30.021
Please.

29:30.023 --> 29:31.906
Please, man, I'm begging you.

29:31.908 --> 29:33.658
For Emily.

29:33.660 --> 29:35.743
- For Emily's life.
- What the hell is

29:35.745 --> 29:38.496
going on down here?!

29:38.498 --> 29:40.915
I-I need
some time, Watson.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.667
I will be in touch.

29:47.422 --> 29:48.589
Why is he so upset?

29:48.591 --> 29:50.091
What-what did you say to him?

29:51.993 --> 29:53.511
The truth.

29:53.513 --> 29:56.130
It's the God's
honest truth.

30:19.454 --> 30:20.822
This is Sherlock Holmes.

30:20.824 --> 30:23.875
I would like to speak
with my father.

30:33.303 --> 30:34.802
Good news, Rhys.

30:34.804 --> 30:37.338
You will be reunited
with Emily within the hour.

30:38.157 --> 30:39.423
What, you found her?

30:39.425 --> 30:40.758
I telephoned the kidnapper.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.226
I told him we would
pay the ransom.

30:42.228 --> 30:43.728
But you know I don't
have the money.

30:43.730 --> 30:45.646
I have the money,
or at least, my father does.

30:45.648 --> 30:47.231
I reached out to him.

30:48.383 --> 30:49.767
He agreed to loan me

30:49.769 --> 30:51.569
$2.2 million, on condition

30:51.571 --> 30:54.222
that I perform various errands
for him in the near future.

30:54.224 --> 30:55.907
Don't know what
they are yet, but, uh,

30:55.909 --> 30:58.192
knowing him, it's a virtual lock
I will be stealing candy

30:58.194 --> 31:00.077
from infants
or clubbing young seals.

31:00.079 --> 31:01.729
I can't believe you reached out
to your father.

31:01.731 --> 31:03.030
Oh, man, I
don't know what

31:03.032 --> 31:04.365
to say, man
We're going to meet

31:04.367 --> 31:06.784
Emily's abductor
at 238th and Irwin

31:06.786 --> 31:08.619
in, uh, just under an hour.

31:08.621 --> 31:09.871
He will be in a blue van.

31:09.873 --> 31:11.572
I transfer the money
electronically,

31:11.574 --> 31:12.740
he will release her.

31:12.742 --> 31:14.425
Watson, would you
be so kind

31:14.427 --> 31:15.843
as to fetch my tablet for me?

31:15.845 --> 31:17.011
I'll need it to
perform the transfer.

31:17.013 --> 31:18.546
Sure.

31:18.548 --> 31:20.932
Thank you.

31:20.934 --> 31:22.884
There's something that
you need to understand.

31:22.886 --> 31:24.936
Given a little more time,
I would have found Emily

31:24.938 --> 31:27.438
by my own devices;
of this I have no doubt.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.440
But it occurred to me that
a little more time with you

31:29.442 --> 31:31.058
is a dangerous thing.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.727
The fact that the
money I've procured

31:32.729 --> 31:34.612
will liberate Emily
is almost incidental.

31:34.614 --> 31:37.431
What it's really doing, Rhys,
is buying a life without you.

31:37.433 --> 31:40.234
After today, you are never
to darken my doorway again.

31:40.236 --> 31:41.652
Our friendship has
run its course.

31:41.654 --> 31:43.621
Have I made myself clear?

31:48.794 --> 31:51.295
♪

32:11.733 --> 32:13.351
Can I help you?

32:13.353 --> 32:14.852
Yeah, Special Agent Xande Diaz.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.020
I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes.

32:16.022 --> 32:17.972
I've uncovered
some information

32:17.974 --> 32:20.524
about the girl
he's trying to find.

32:20.526 --> 32:22.743
He needs to know
about it right away.

32:50.023 --> 32:52.339
Hello.
It was an ambush.

32:52.341 --> 32:54.442
A group of painters
when I arrived on the scene.

32:54.444 --> 32:58.145
But they're not painters--
their shoes

32:58.147 --> 33:00.531
<i>were as clean</i>
<i>as they are expensive.</i>

33:02.517 --> 33:04.068
They're a hit squad--

33:04.070 --> 33:06.454
employees, no doubt,
of the Dominican cartel

33:06.456 --> 33:08.539
that we crossed paths
with the other night.

33:08.541 --> 33:11.459
One of them used
the word <i>"aguajero."</i>

33:11.461 --> 33:15.379
It's Dominican slang
for "braggart."

33:15.381 --> 33:16.914
Someone told them
to lie in wait.

33:16.916 --> 33:18.749
Someone who had pull
within the organization.

33:18.751 --> 33:20.885
Someone who also knew I was
investigating Emily's abduction.

33:20.887 --> 33:22.536
Only one person meets

33:22.538 --> 33:25.139
those particular criteria...
The agent from the D.E.A.

33:25.141 --> 33:27.758
The one who beat you up
the other night.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.510
I know.

33:41.355 --> 33:44.256
<i>Aq, aquíuí</i>

33:46.346 --> 33:48.209
Your friends are alive,
Mr. Holmes.

33:48.211 --> 33:49.210
Excellent.

33:49.212 --> 33:50.645
How long depends on you.

33:50.647 --> 33:52.163
Give me a moment
to secure transportation.

33:52.165 --> 33:54.182
I'll meet you at my place.

33:54.184 --> 33:55.933
We can talk face-to-face.

33:55.935 --> 33:57.985
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

33:57.987 --> 34:00.438
Speaking of friends,
I just met some of yours.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.240
I don't think
they liked me very much.

34:02.242 --> 34:04.776
I told them you work
for a rival gang.

34:04.778 --> 34:06.577
But now I realize
that sending them

34:06.579 --> 34:07.845
after you was a mistake.

34:07.847 --> 34:09.030
Oh?

34:09.032 --> 34:10.331
The money
that you were offering,

34:10.333 --> 34:12.083
I thought that was coming
from Rhys.

34:12.085 --> 34:14.101
<i>I thought you would be</i>
<i>transferring it</i>

34:14.103 --> 34:15.703
<i>from his account, not yours.</i>

34:15.705 --> 34:17.071
<i>Now I know</i>

34:17.072 --> 34:18.255
that wasn't the case.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.542
So I must've, uh, scared you
the other night.

34:21.543 --> 34:24.429
Everything I was able
to deduce about you.

34:24.431 --> 34:27.081
You thought you'd kill me,
then swoop

34:27.083 --> 34:29.750
on the softer target, Rhys.

34:29.752 --> 34:31.351
Get him to transfer the funds.

34:31.353 --> 34:33.087
You're pretty fit, Watson.
You know that?

34:33.089 --> 34:35.356
But more importantly,

34:35.358 --> 34:37.058
you're a good friend.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.476
Could you just shut up?

34:38.478 --> 34:40.228
I need you to do
something for me.

34:40.230 --> 34:41.978
Tell Holmes I'm sorry.

34:41.981 --> 34:43.781
Just stay calm.
You can tell him yourself.

34:43.783 --> 34:45.933
Uh, not after I've cut
myself loose, I can't.

34:45.935 --> 34:47.235
What are you doing?

34:47.237 --> 34:48.319
Back in the day,

34:48.321 --> 34:49.704
I dealt to a
famous punker

34:49.706 --> 34:51.406
for a brief stretch
in the '80s.

34:51.408 --> 34:54.876
One of them gave me a little
pocketknife as a keepsake.

34:54.878 --> 34:57.128
Since then, the only thing
I've ever cut with it

34:57.130 --> 34:58.279
has been lines of...

34:58.281 --> 34:59.831
I get it. I get it. Just...

34:59.833 --> 35:01.132
Y-You need to stop now.

35:01.134 --> 35:03.918
No. I need to right
a terrible wrong.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.838
Maybe a few terrible wrongs.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.757
I'm gonna save you, and then
Holmes is gonna save Emily,

35:09.759 --> 35:12.059
and then that'll
be that.

35:12.061 --> 35:15.596
All I ask is you get
out that door, okay?

35:15.598 --> 35:17.565
I imagine that
you learned about the robbery

35:17.567 --> 35:20.435
he'd perpetrated after
you infiltrated the cartel.

35:20.437 --> 35:22.653
You know, they were never
able to find him

35:22.655 --> 35:24.238
or the money.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.191
But then again, they didn't
have the resources

35:27.193 --> 35:29.694
of a powerful government agency
behind them,

35:29.696 --> 35:31.696
did they? I imagine
you found his name

35:31.698 --> 35:33.781
from Emily's Social Security
information?

35:33.783 --> 35:34.982
Am I close?

35:34.984 --> 35:36.334
Listen to me.

35:36.764 --> 35:38.413
I want you to transfer
the money now.

35:38.545 --> 35:41.096
As soon as I see
it in my account,

35:40.200 --> 35:41.533
I will let your
friends go.

35:43.482 --> 35:45.365
You just tried
to have me killed, so...

35:45.701 --> 35:47.901
give me a reason
I should trust you.

35:55.522 --> 35:57.505
Watson! Watson!

36:01.527 --> 36:03.478
Sherlock, Rhys has been shot.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.813
Guy who did it is unconscious.
Call 911!

36:08.617 --> 36:10.535
I had nothing to do with

36:10.537 --> 36:12.820
this woman's abduction. Until
just now, I didn't even know

36:12.822 --> 36:14.455
what she looked like.
That's funny.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.991
Because according to a statement
we got from Joan Watson,

36:16.993 --> 36:20.328
you approached her and
the girl's father this morning

36:20.330 --> 36:22.079
with information
about her whereabouts.

36:22.081 --> 36:23.881
Totally untrue.

36:23.883 --> 36:26.167
What <i>is</i> true?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.787
That I've been working
in the New York

36:29.789 --> 36:32.874
faction of a Dominican drug
cartel for almost a year now.

36:32.876 --> 36:35.876
That, during my time with them,
I became aware of a man

36:35.878 --> 36:38.846
by the name of Rhys Kinlan,
a former employee of the cartel.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.715
This would be the same Rhys
Kinlan you shot this morning?

36:41.717 --> 36:44.202
In self-defense, yes.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.153
Look,

36:46.155 --> 36:47.989
I saw Mr. Kinlan
on the street today.

36:47.991 --> 36:50.608
I followed him to a brownstone
where he appeared to be staying.

36:50.610 --> 36:53.578
I thought he might be useful
to my investigation.

36:53.580 --> 36:56.581
But when I told him
I was D.E.A., he panicked.

36:56.583 --> 37:00.585
He attacked me. I-I had
no choice but to restrain him.

37:00.587 --> 37:03.237
Mm. And Miss Watson?

37:03.239 --> 37:06.841
I regret that, but under
the circumstances, I....

37:06.843 --> 37:09.743
assumed that she was working
with Mr. Kinlan.

37:09.745 --> 37:11.012
He managed
to free himself.

37:11.014 --> 37:12.763
He came at me with a knife,

37:12.765 --> 37:14.265
so I fired on him.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.917
You know, um, I heard
from a mutual acquaintance

37:16.919 --> 37:18.886
of ours a little while ago.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.304
Sherlock Holmes.

37:20.306 --> 37:24.692
I believe you two talked
on the phone today.

37:24.694 --> 37:27.812
He wishes he could be here, but
he actually went to the hospital

37:27.814 --> 37:29.597
to see if Mr. Kinlan
pulls through.

37:29.599 --> 37:32.567
And just-just out of curiosity,
if Kinlan does pull through,

37:32.569 --> 37:36.404
whose version of events do you
think he's gonna agree with?

37:36.406 --> 37:39.290
Yours? Or Miss Watson's?

37:39.292 --> 37:41.659
I don't think I care very much

37:41.661 --> 37:43.744
what a known drug dealer
has to say.

37:43.746 --> 37:45.546
Hard to imagine
a jury will either.

37:45.548 --> 37:48.883
This is...
from the District Attorney.

37:48.885 --> 37:51.252
Tell us

37:51.254 --> 37:55.289
where the girl is and he'll
guarantee you protective custody

37:55.291 --> 37:56.891
while you're in prison.

37:56.893 --> 37:58.959
You do not

37:58.961 --> 38:01.228
want to find yourself
in gen pop, Agent Diaz.

38:01.230 --> 38:03.814
Especially not after
your cartel friends

38:03.816 --> 38:06.133
realize you've been
spying on them.

38:06.135 --> 38:07.401
Look, I'm sorry.

38:07.403 --> 38:09.437
I wish I could help.

38:09.439 --> 38:13.524
Actually, I think
you're hoping Emily dies.

38:13.526 --> 38:16.277
'Cause then there's no one
to testify.

38:16.279 --> 38:18.913
You might actually get away
with everything.

38:18.915 --> 38:21.032
Did you know that
the apartment

38:21.034 --> 38:23.034
you're doing the
undercover stint in

38:23.036 --> 38:27.004
is about half a block away
from an Ethiopian restaurant?

38:27.006 --> 38:29.790
I get takeout
from there sometimes. So what?

38:29.792 --> 38:32.710
Did you also know that there are
exactly five pre-war buildings

38:32.712 --> 38:35.996
in a one-mile radius of that
restaurant and your apartment?

38:35.998 --> 38:38.599
Three of those buildings
are abandoned.

38:38.601 --> 38:41.602
It's ideal for stashing
a kidnapped girl.

38:41.604 --> 38:44.438
Holmes shared
a theory with me.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.109
He thinks Emily's being kept
in a pre-war building

38:48.111 --> 38:51.512
in close proximity
to an Ethiopian restaurant.

38:52.681 --> 38:55.700
Right now, I've got
a small army of cops

38:55.702 --> 38:57.985
searching the
aforementioned buildings.

38:57.987 --> 39:00.204
Now, personally, I think
it's just a matter of time

39:00.206 --> 39:02.156
before they find her.

39:02.158 --> 39:05.660
But considering that she needs
medical attention,

39:05.662 --> 39:09.697
I would prefer it be sooner
rather than later.

39:10.882 --> 39:14.135
Now, if you'd like
to reconsider

39:14.137 --> 39:17.338
the D.A.'s generous offer,

39:17.340 --> 39:20.091
you know where we'll be.

39:20.093 --> 39:22.093
Wait.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.896
Wait.

39:34.773 --> 39:38.659
You'd think after everything
I've done to my liver,

39:38.661 --> 39:43.247
it could deflect a
couple of bullets, huh?

39:43.249 --> 39:44.749
Emily. Is she...

39:44.751 --> 39:45.916
Safe.

39:45.918 --> 39:47.901
Recovered a short while ago.

39:50.707 --> 39:54.458
Where's your... better half?

39:54.460 --> 39:56.260
As you can imagine,
Miss Watson was quite spent

39:56.262 --> 39:57.745
after this morning's ordeal.

39:57.747 --> 39:59.096
She's getting some rest.

39:59.098 --> 40:01.098
She saved my life, you know.

40:01.100 --> 40:04.685
As I understand it, she was
just returning the favor.

40:04.687 --> 40:07.555
What's this?

40:07.557 --> 40:09.106
Money.

40:09.108 --> 40:11.142
Not my father's money.

40:11.144 --> 40:14.061
I returned that a few hours ago.

40:14.063 --> 40:18.232
It's just... some cash I keep
lying around the brownstone

40:18.234 --> 40:20.201
to pay informants.
It's not much, but, um,

40:20.203 --> 40:22.203
I assume you'll want
to go on the lam again

40:22.205 --> 40:24.538
once you've recovered.

40:24.540 --> 40:27.625
Is that for my benefit
or for yours?

40:27.627 --> 40:31.495
The road to recovery,
I've found,

40:31.497 --> 40:34.715
is as treacherous
as it is tedious.

40:34.717 --> 40:38.886
Tests of my sobriety
arise almost daily.

40:38.888 --> 40:42.306
You were just the most recent.

40:45.894 --> 40:47.461
Hey.

40:49.431 --> 40:51.932
I believe in you.

40:51.934 --> 40:54.134
Always will.

40:58.273 --> 40:59.940
Dad.

40:59.942 --> 41:02.610
Emily.

41:16.258 --> 41:19.376
And here I thought ol'
Angus had finally met his maker.

41:19.378 --> 41:21.545
You remembered his name.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.497
Consider us touched.

41:23.499 --> 41:26.467
How long have I
been asleep for?

41:26.469 --> 41:28.001
Just over six hours.

41:31.773 --> 41:34.708
You did a remarkable thing
today, Watson.

41:34.710 --> 41:38.011
I just stopped the bleeding
till the paramedics got there.

41:38.013 --> 41:40.815
After you incapacitated
an armed gunman.

41:40.817 --> 41:43.016
Angus helped.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.823
He offered me cocaine
last night.

41:48.825 --> 41:50.908
Rhys.

41:50.910 --> 41:53.911
He thought I needed it
to find his daughter.

41:53.913 --> 41:56.130
It was right there
on the table.

41:56.132 --> 41:59.834
That's why I threw him
into the chair.

42:02.471 --> 42:05.322
But you didn't use it.

42:05.324 --> 42:07.992
Want to talk about it?

42:07.994 --> 42:10.010
Not with you.

42:10.012 --> 42:13.380
That is to say,
I think it's a tale

42:13.382 --> 42:17.217
more suited to a...
group setting.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.655
Others may find inspiration
in my abstinence.

42:21.657 --> 42:24.358
Apparently.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.862
Um, there's a meeting
in Cobble Hill in about...

42:27.864 --> 42:30.114
15 minutes. Yeah.
So, I was thinking, um,

42:30.116 --> 42:33.534
if you can hold off
on dinner for a bit then,

42:33.536 --> 42:35.419
you might join me?
