WEBVTT

00:23.356 --> 00:25.289
Not big enough--
we need more.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.690
We got more.

00:41.539 --> 00:44.206
Any, uh, places I should avoid
in the next few days?

00:44.208 --> 00:46.575
Los Angeles.

00:46.577 --> 00:48.410
Right.

00:48.412 --> 00:50.511
Pleasure doing business
with you, amigos.

00:53.716 --> 00:56.483
(engine starts)

01:07.829 --> 01:09.761
Sale complete.

01:12.632 --> 01:14.831
(siren whoops)

01:17.368 --> 01:18.834
FBI!

01:18.836 --> 01:21.069
Turn off your engine!

01:22.739 --> 01:23.838
FBI!

01:23.840 --> 01:26.674
Exit the vehicle
with your hands up!

01:27.710 --> 01:28.842
MAN:
Slowly.

01:28.844 --> 01:31.110
You, get 'em up.

01:31.112 --> 01:32.511
Hands on your head.

01:33.514 --> 01:34.546
Turn around.

01:34.548 --> 01:36.247
(man speaks
indistinctly)

01:36.249 --> 01:37.815
All right, cuff him.

01:37.817 --> 01:39.316
Right here...

01:39.318 --> 01:40.383
Clear.

01:41.319 --> 01:43.152
Good work, Agent Nasri.

01:44.121 --> 01:45.404
Real shame.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.688
I was starting
to enjoy their company.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.089
Really?
Yeah.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.324
Man, I've been listening
to their wiretaps,

01:49.325 --> 01:50.558
and they were getting
really sick of you.

01:52.161 --> 01:53.093
Secure the C-4.

01:53.095 --> 01:54.227
I'll notify
the director.

01:54.229 --> 01:55.394
Check the front.

01:55.396 --> 01:56.561
All right.
You're with me.

01:56.563 --> 01:57.762
Agent Conway.

01:57.764 --> 01:59.530
The director, please.

01:59.532 --> 02:00.564
Yes, sir.

02:00.566 --> 02:02.132
The op was a success.

02:02.134 --> 02:03.833
Yes, sir, I'll notify
the A.G.'s office.

02:03.835 --> 02:06.435
They should have everything
they need by the end of the day.

02:11.875 --> 02:15.776
(alarm blaring)

02:52.781 --> 02:54.080
DEEKS: Okay, last one.
KENSI: Come on, last one.

02:54.081 --> 02:55.380
Let's do this,
attack the ground!
(screams)

02:55.383 --> 02:56.782
Attack the ground!

02:56.784 --> 02:57.916
I don't know why we can't run
like normal human beings.

02:57.918 --> 02:59.784
This is so weird
and unnatural.
(laughs)

02:59.786 --> 03:01.452
Quit being a Sally.

03:01.454 --> 03:03.454
You'll find muscles
you never knew you had.

03:03.456 --> 03:05.689
What are you
talking about?

03:05.691 --> 03:07.691
I've got muscles
in all the right places.

03:07.693 --> 03:10.694
I'm a lean, mean
sex machine.

03:10.696 --> 03:12.362
Or that's what
my, uh, ladybird says.

03:12.364 --> 03:13.896
(chuckles)

03:13.898 --> 03:16.231
I never said that.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.233
Yeah, you said it
to me three days ago.

03:18.235 --> 03:20.635
You actually
whispered it...

03:20.637 --> 03:22.303
in my ear.

03:22.305 --> 03:23.871
You bit said ear.

03:23.873 --> 03:26.340
Which kind of hurt,
but I also kind of liked it.

03:26.342 --> 03:27.908
Huh, yeah, well,
I take it back.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.242
You can't
take it back.

03:29.244 --> 03:30.409
I still have little
teeth marks on my ear.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.710
Yeah, no, I mean
I take back saying

03:31.712 --> 03:32.711
that you're a
sex machine.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.212
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.480
Want me to prove it to you
right here and right now?

03:37.916 --> 03:39.782
Okay, don't look now,

03:39.784 --> 03:42.184
but your five o'clock,
woman with a camera.

03:45.923 --> 03:47.422
What did I just say?
I said don't look.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.323
What?
That was natural.

03:51.193 --> 03:53.359
(car door closes, engine starts)

03:53.361 --> 03:54.560
No plates.

03:54.562 --> 03:56.828
DEEKS: Sure she was
taking photos of us?

03:56.830 --> 03:57.962
(cell phone chimes)

03:57.964 --> 03:59.964
Yeah, I mean...

03:59.966 --> 04:02.299
I don't know, you think
I'm being paranoid?

04:03.268 --> 04:05.368
I think they need
us in Ops.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.702
Look alive!

04:06.704 --> 04:08.704
FBI!

04:08.705 --> 04:10.705
ERIC:
Mojave Desert, one hour ago.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.376
The FBI was in the final
stage of a sting operation

04:14.378 --> 04:16.378
with some homegrown
terrorists.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.347
They had just completed a sale
of C-4 and arrested the men

04:19.349 --> 04:20.414
when this happened.

04:23.585 --> 04:24.917
How many dead?

04:24.919 --> 04:26.585
Three agents

04:26.587 --> 04:28.787
including Agent
Jalil Nasri,

04:28.789 --> 04:30.221
who had been undercover
with the suspects

04:30.223 --> 04:31.922
for the last four months.

04:31.924 --> 04:33.223
He gained their trust,

04:33.225 --> 04:34.357
introduced them
to an arms dealer...

04:34.359 --> 04:36.392
Who also happened
to be an FBI agent.

04:36.394 --> 04:38.994
Sale went down,
so did the terrorists.

04:38.996 --> 04:40.996
Since 9/11,
these sting operations

04:40.998 --> 04:42.564
have become common practice.

04:42.566 --> 04:44.265
Okay, so what
went wrong?

04:44.267 --> 04:45.833
Did the two terrorists
set a detonator?

04:45.835 --> 04:48.836
Well, it's unlikely, because
they never touched the C-4.

04:48.838 --> 04:51.939
It was passed from one
undercover agent to the next.

04:51.941 --> 04:54.675
The FBI had it
in their custody the entire op.

04:54.677 --> 04:57.244
So the FBI wants our help
with this investigation?

04:57.246 --> 04:58.378
More like our heads.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.246
C-4 was on loan from the DoD.

05:00.248 --> 05:02.281
It's considered controlled
defense material.

05:02.283 --> 05:03.982
Wait, so this is
about liability?

05:03.984 --> 05:06.517
SECNAV wants assurance
that there was no problem

05:06.519 --> 05:08.752
with the supply
of explosives.

05:08.754 --> 05:10.887
If so...

05:10.888 --> 05:13.021
Other operations
could be at risk.

05:13.024 --> 05:15.824
DEEKS: And it opens up the DoD
to a civil lawsuit.

05:15.826 --> 05:19.661
You thinking of retaking
the California Bar, Mr. Deeks?

05:19.663 --> 05:20.862
Three days of hell?

05:20.864 --> 05:22.496
I'd rather clean half
of Kensi's apartment.

05:22.498 --> 05:24.297
I keep offering.

05:24.299 --> 05:28.000
Well, until that time,
I'd like you and Mr. Callen

05:28.002 --> 05:33.271
to ensure that the Navy's C-4
supply hasn't been compromised.

05:33.273 --> 05:35.306
You-- it sounded like
you said me and Callen.

05:35.308 --> 05:36.006
Deeks and me?

05:36.008 --> 05:37.307
Mr. Hanna,

05:37.309 --> 05:39.475
I'd like you
and Ms. Blye

05:39.477 --> 05:41.643
to handle the
crime scene.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.710
Uh, is there any...?

05:44.046 --> 05:45.945
Hmm... okay.

05:45.947 --> 05:48.380
I guess we're...

05:55.589 --> 05:57.055
Okay.

06:06.031 --> 06:08.898
NCIS, looking for First
Lieutenant Winters.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.299
One moment.

06:12.069 --> 06:14.035
(sighs)
Lieutenant,
NCIS is here.

06:14.037 --> 06:15.703
So, uh...

06:15.705 --> 06:17.037
Yes, sir.

06:17.039 --> 06:18.371
...Joelle's good?

06:18.373 --> 06:20.339
She's good.

06:22.309 --> 06:23.941
She's great.

06:23.943 --> 06:25.075
Great.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.676
Great, great, great.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.012
How's Kensi?

06:30.014 --> 06:32.014
Uh, Kensi's...
she's...

06:32.016 --> 06:34.016
you know, she's good.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.550
I don't know
why you're asking me.

06:35.552 --> 06:37.385
I mean, you work with her,
you know she's...

06:37.387 --> 06:38.886
she's good, right?
Mm-hmm.

06:38.888 --> 06:40.554
Because I don't know
why I would have any...

06:40.556 --> 06:41.888
(chuckles)

06:41.890 --> 06:43.022
What?

06:43.024 --> 06:45.090
(sighs)

06:45.092 --> 06:46.958
You know, don't you?

06:46.960 --> 06:48.092
Of course I know.

06:48.094 --> 06:49.626
Who else knows?

06:49.628 --> 06:50.627
Well, let's see.

06:50.629 --> 06:53.029
Sam, Nell,
Hetty, of course.

06:53.031 --> 06:55.031
Eric took a little while,
but he finally got there.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.565
The guys in
the motor pool.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.033
Pretty much everyone
at this point.

06:58.035 --> 06:59.601
What about Granger?

06:59.603 --> 07:01.336
Granger I'm not
so sure about.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.671
Uh, he's definitely mellowed
since the poisoning,

07:03.673 --> 07:06.006
but he... he could just
be biding his time,

07:06.008 --> 07:08.041
waiting for the right
moment to crush you both.

07:08.043 --> 07:10.109
Well, that is...
awesome.

07:10.111 --> 07:11.677
Mm-hmm.

07:11.679 --> 07:13.879
Don't pretend like you
didn't know the risks.

07:17.851 --> 07:19.517
I'm just wondering
if this partner shuffle

07:19.519 --> 07:21.051
has something
to do with us.

07:21.053 --> 07:23.553
That is a question
only Hetty can answer.

07:24.856 --> 07:27.523
Agent Callen,
Detective Deeks.

07:27.525 --> 07:28.524
How are you?

07:28.526 --> 07:29.925
All right,
come on in.

07:33.363 --> 07:36.497
This is the same lot of C-4
we drew from for the FBI.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.365
I personally oversee
the transfer

07:38.367 --> 07:40.100
of all Class-A
explosives,

07:40.101 --> 07:41.834
I can tell you-- protocol was
followed to the letter.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.069
Has it been tested?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.737
Just before you arrived,

07:44.739 --> 07:46.739
I conducted standard burn
and impact tests.

07:46.741 --> 07:48.140
Performed as expected.

07:48.142 --> 07:49.908
And how is that?

07:49.910 --> 07:53.444
Blew up when it was supposed to,
didn't when it wasn't.

07:53.446 --> 07:55.712
For this C-4 to detonate
during the FBI's op,

07:55.714 --> 07:57.046
it would've needed a primer.

07:57.048 --> 07:58.614
And we didn't
supply them with one.

07:58.616 --> 08:01.483
Which means somebody else did.

08:05.055 --> 08:06.721
Excuse me, can I...?

08:06.723 --> 08:08.456
Can I please have a minute?

08:32.181 --> 08:33.847
Something's
bothering you.

08:33.849 --> 08:35.048
Why do you say that?

08:35.050 --> 08:37.750
(scoffs) The look
on your face is the same

08:37.752 --> 08:39.718
as when Deeks eats pistachios.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.187
He gets the shells everywhere--
it's disgusting.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.189
All right, I'll have
a talk with him. What's up?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.191
It's not big enough.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.293
What do you mean?

08:48.295 --> 08:49.961
Ten pounds of C-4,

08:49.963 --> 08:52.630
the debris should be
half a mile away.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.532
So, are you thinking
not all of it exploded?

09:01.005 --> 09:03.005
You got to be
kidding me.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.206
What do you got?

09:14.150 --> 09:18.252
A van full of C-4 explodes,
you assume it was the C-4.

09:18.254 --> 09:20.254
Case was lined
with pumice.

09:20.256 --> 09:23.123
Absorbs the shock.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.991
So there was another bomb
on the van.

09:24.993 --> 09:27.059
I'm thinking remote detonation.

09:28.996 --> 09:30.328
They waited
for the precise moment

09:30.330 --> 09:33.030
when only the FBI agents were
in the blast zone.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.868
There.

09:41.905 --> 09:43.638
That's where I'd be.

09:45.608 --> 09:49.109
Perfect vantage point
for the sting and take down.

09:49.111 --> 09:51.310
Good access to the roads
leading south.

09:54.248 --> 09:56.781
We got footprints.

09:56.783 --> 09:58.582
Looks like a size 11.

09:58.584 --> 09:59.950
Work boots.

09:59.952 --> 10:02.018
Most likely male.

10:03.788 --> 10:05.120
I got tire
tracks, too.

10:05.122 --> 10:07.188
I'll send these
over to Eric.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.789
(phone imitates camera sound)

10:09.758 --> 10:11.824
Kensi.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.160
You got pistachio face--
what's up?

10:15.162 --> 10:19.164
Taking out three FBI agents
in a secret sting operation,

10:19.166 --> 10:21.166
that's impressive.

10:21.168 --> 10:23.768
(phone imitates camera sound)

10:23.770 --> 10:26.203
A killer like this doesn't
usually leave this many clues.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.206
Unless he's sending a message.

10:42.219 --> 10:44.352
Based on the tire tracks
left at the crime scene,

10:44.354 --> 10:46.354
we're probably looking
for an older-model SUV.

10:46.356 --> 10:47.621
Early 2000s.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.790
Anything from
Kaleidoscope?

10:49.791 --> 10:51.958
(scoffs) This is what
we have to work with--

10:51.960 --> 10:53.726
20 square miles
of nothing,

10:53.728 --> 10:55.060
and that
includes cameras.

10:55.062 --> 10:57.095
Now the FBI's resources
are strained, so...

10:57.097 --> 11:00.965
they're letting Sam and Kensi
track the vehicle on the ground.

11:00.967 --> 11:03.167
Our hope is that the
tire tracks lead

11:03.169 --> 11:04.735
to a road with a camera.

11:04.737 --> 11:06.636
What about
the watch they found?

11:06.638 --> 11:08.771
Sold in over
3,000 stores online.

11:08.773 --> 11:11.640
At least 800
sold every year.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.274
Impossible to trace.

11:13.276 --> 11:15.776
Hands are stopped at 5:37.

11:15.778 --> 11:18.044
Ticking clock
without the ticking.

11:18.046 --> 11:20.079
Has it been dusted for prints?
ERIC:
That's happening now.

11:20.081 --> 11:21.914
I'll let you know
when the report comes in.

11:21.916 --> 11:25.150
Someone else placed
a bomb on this van.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.186
Maybe the van's owners have
an idea how this happened.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.654
Well, Demir Malki was hit

11:29.656 --> 11:30.888
with shrapnel
from the blast.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.291
He's in surgery.
And his brother Dogan

11:34.293 --> 11:35.925
is in custody
at the FBI's

11:35.927 --> 11:38.427
Undercover Task Force
offices in Mar Vista.

11:38.429 --> 11:40.028
Let's go talk to Dogan.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.231
I'll catch up with you.
I got one stop to make.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.332
How far back should I go?

11:44.334 --> 11:46.233
All the way back.

11:48.170 --> 11:50.036
Hetty, hey, listen,
we need to...

11:50.038 --> 11:51.370
Whoa! What are...?

11:51.372 --> 11:52.671
Who was that?

11:52.673 --> 11:54.473
Uh, who was who?

11:54.474 --> 11:56.274
The woman on the screen that
was just up there-- who is that?

11:56.276 --> 11:58.909
That woman was taking pictures
of me and Kensi this morning.

11:58.911 --> 12:00.377
Oh, damn.

12:00.379 --> 12:01.845
Hetty, what's going on?

12:01.847 --> 12:03.847
All I can tell you, Mr. Deeks,

12:03.849 --> 12:05.882
is that I'm looking into it.

12:05.884 --> 12:07.984
Right. Listen, uh...

12:07.986 --> 12:09.719
Hetty, if she's
some sort of threat,

12:09.721 --> 12:10.853
I think that we should...

12:10.855 --> 12:13.388
No, she is not a threat.

12:13.390 --> 12:16.023
Not yet.
Not yet.

12:16.025 --> 12:17.924
What is imperative

12:17.926 --> 12:19.892
is that you

12:19.894 --> 12:22.895
and Ms. Blye stay apart

12:22.897 --> 12:24.796
for today.

12:24.798 --> 12:26.798
Am I understood?

12:26.800 --> 12:28.332
(clears throat)

12:28.334 --> 12:29.333
Hetty, it's, um...

12:29.335 --> 12:32.069
Mr. Deeks, yes or no.

12:33.138 --> 12:34.470
Yes.

12:34.472 --> 12:36.738
With an
off-the-record no.

12:39.042 --> 12:41.709
All right. Good.

12:41.711 --> 12:43.043
Okay.

12:50.852 --> 12:53.953
You let him see the photo
on purpose, didn't you?

12:53.955 --> 12:57.256
I wanted to know
how much he knew.

12:57.258 --> 13:00.892
Now I know.

13:00.894 --> 13:03.761
Back to work, Ms. Jones.

13:03.763 --> 13:05.496
Why didn't you tell us?

13:05.498 --> 13:07.798
We were respecting
your privacy.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.400
And you're okay with this?

13:10.402 --> 13:12.735
Am I okay with my
coworkers dating? No.

13:12.737 --> 13:14.970
Does that mean I want you
off the team? Hell, no.

13:14.972 --> 13:16.237
And that goes
for Deeks, too.

13:16.239 --> 13:18.005
Oh, well...
Don't tell him I said that.

13:18.007 --> 13:20.007
I will not.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.776
It's just, you know,
eventually, you guys

13:22.778 --> 13:24.844
are gonna have to figure out
where this thing is going.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.413
You don't want to continue to
put your lives on the line.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.014
Meaning what?

13:29.016 --> 13:31.016
Meaning that...

13:31.018 --> 13:32.484
when Michelle and I had Kam,

13:32.486 --> 13:34.185
that was a whole nother mission.

13:34.187 --> 13:35.519
Kids.

13:35.521 --> 13:37.020
Yeah, no.

13:37.022 --> 13:38.021
No, no, no, no, no.

13:38.023 --> 13:39.856
We're not, we're not...

13:39.858 --> 13:40.990
we're not thinking about kids.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.491
We're not even thinking
about dinner.

13:42.493 --> 13:46.127
That's fine, but things don't
always go as they're planned.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.895
Things happen.
Kids happen.

13:48.998 --> 13:50.931
That's what happened
with Aiden, he kind of...

13:50.933 --> 13:55.035
popped up out of the blue.

13:55.037 --> 13:56.870
I thought I was ready
for anything--

13:56.872 --> 13:59.906
active duty, whatever--
but not for that.

13:59.908 --> 14:01.407
I wasn't a perfect
dad, either.

14:01.409 --> 14:04.777
I made a lot of mistakes
those first years.

14:04.779 --> 14:05.944
(wry laugh)

14:05.946 --> 14:08.012
I think Aiden was a lucky kid.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.947
I was the lucky one.

14:13.051 --> 14:14.850
Still am.

14:19.489 --> 14:21.789
CONWAY:
<i> So our terrorist, Dogan Malki,</i>

14:21.791 --> 14:23.023
hasn't said a word to us.

14:23.025 --> 14:24.424
Normally I wouldn't
allow this,

14:24.426 --> 14:27.226
but since the attack...

14:27.228 --> 14:28.560
we've been
a little shorthanded.

14:30.063 --> 14:31.128
Have at him.

14:35.467 --> 14:36.999
Dogan Malki.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.935
Wow, that is quite
the... bloodstain.

14:39.937 --> 14:42.504
That's from your
younger brother, right?

14:47.544 --> 14:49.844
CALLEN: FBI says
you don't like to talk.

14:49.846 --> 14:52.546
That's fine.
Just listen.

14:52.548 --> 14:54.881
Your brother Demir
is dying.

14:54.883 --> 14:55.982
The shrapnel ripped
apart his kidneys.

14:55.984 --> 14:57.850
He needs a new one
immediately.

14:57.852 --> 14:59.918
As you can probably imagine,
being a terrorist

14:59.920 --> 15:02.520
doesn't put you very high on the
priority list for transplants.

15:02.522 --> 15:04.288
The good news--
for you, of course--

15:04.290 --> 15:06.456
being that they make
exceptions for family.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.358
Y-Yes... yes, of course.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.492
I'll give him mine.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.093
Well, that is actively
heartwarming.

15:12.095 --> 15:13.360
There's just one

15:13.362 --> 15:14.678
small problem.

15:14.679 --> 15:15.995
CALLEN: The FBI thinks
you and your brother

15:15.997 --> 15:17.230
killed three of their agents.

15:17.231 --> 15:18.464
They're not letting you
go anywhere.

15:18.466 --> 15:20.833
But, uh... we didn't kill them.

15:20.835 --> 15:23.035
Hmm. So how did the bomb
get in the van?

15:23.037 --> 15:24.436
How would I know?

15:24.438 --> 15:26.938
Please... my-my brother
needs my help.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.139
CALLEN:
Think, Dogan!

15:28.141 --> 15:30.040
Did you loan the van to anyone?

15:30.042 --> 15:31.107
Did you take it
anywhere recently?

15:31.109 --> 15:32.108
I-I-I-I, I don't...

15:32.110 --> 15:33.576
DEEKS:
A car wash, valet parking.

15:33.578 --> 15:35.010
I don't remember!

15:35.012 --> 15:36.411
Your brother is dying!

15:38.448 --> 15:39.847
A mechanic.

15:39.849 --> 15:41.515
I-I-I t-took it to a mechanic.

15:41.517 --> 15:44.284
We had a flat tire,
uh, about five days ago.

15:44.286 --> 15:46.586
A tow truck came by
about a minute later.

15:46.588 --> 15:47.920
They took it to a shop
in the Valley.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.554
What was the name of the shop?

15:49.556 --> 15:51.055
Lakeview.

15:51.057 --> 15:53.157
Lakeview Auto Repair.

15:53.159 --> 15:54.424
Wait, what about my kidney?

15:54.426 --> 15:56.092
Oh, yeah,
you can keep your kidney,

15:56.094 --> 15:57.393
'cause your brother's fine.

16:12.576 --> 16:15.176
So where is everyone?

16:19.915 --> 16:21.114
Kensi...

16:21.116 --> 16:23.883
KENSI: Looks like
somebody's been off-roading.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.293
(tools clanking)

16:37.063 --> 16:38.028
SAM:
Federal agents!

16:38.030 --> 16:39.463
Drop your weapon.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.097
Drop it!

16:42.200 --> 16:44.099
I sent everyone
home for the day.

16:44.101 --> 16:45.366
Hands up.

16:45.368 --> 16:47.101
I'm unarmed.

16:51.307 --> 16:54.174
I didn't think
you'd find me so quickly.

16:54.176 --> 16:56.176
If you...

16:56.178 --> 16:58.244
Don't.

16:58.246 --> 16:59.712
I'm sorry-- I was trying to say,

16:59.714 --> 17:01.113
if you check the top drawer,

17:01.115 --> 17:02.681
you'll find
what you're looking for.

17:25.138 --> 17:26.504
Sam...

17:27.440 --> 17:29.173
Remote detonator.

17:29.175 --> 17:32.743
You're searching for the person
who planted a bomb and killed

17:32.745 --> 17:34.244
three FBI agents.

17:34.246 --> 17:36.412
You have found him.

17:36.414 --> 17:40.249
I promise you,
I will not resist arrest.

17:40.251 --> 17:42.150
But I also promise...

17:42.152 --> 17:44.218
this morning's attack

17:44.220 --> 17:46.787
will not be the only one today.

17:59.801 --> 18:01.600
His name is Vakeel Shah.

18:01.602 --> 18:04.436
He immigrated here,
from Pakistan, 20 years ago.

18:04.438 --> 18:06.738
He's never been in
any trouble with the law.

18:06.740 --> 18:10.174
He pays his taxes, started a
successful auto repair business.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
Okay, so what happened?

18:11.744 --> 18:15.612
His brother and sister-in-law
died six years ago-- car crash.

18:15.614 --> 18:17.146
Shah took in their son Naveed.

18:17.148 --> 18:18.313
We arrested Naveed...

18:18.315 --> 18:20.682
in a sting operation
last year.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.551
He walked into his high school
wearing a dummy suicide vest.

18:23.553 --> 18:25.703
That you provided him.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.854
I ran the op and Agent Nasri
was undercover.

18:27.857 --> 18:28.806
CALLEN:
Let's stay on track here.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.756
Why don't you tell us
about this watch?

18:29.758 --> 18:31.691
That's Naveed's.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.858
It was broken
during his arrest--

18:32.860 --> 18:35.126
he got physical--
Shah must've claimed it

18:35.128 --> 18:37.695
upon completion of the trial.

18:37.697 --> 18:39.863
Eric said the forensic team
pulled Shah's print off it.

18:39.865 --> 18:41.531
Meaning, regardless
of how we found him,

18:41.533 --> 18:43.299
this watch would've
lead us to Shah.

18:43.301 --> 18:45.200
He wanted to be found.

18:45.202 --> 18:47.402
And he wanted to tell us
about the second attack.

18:47.404 --> 18:49.170
Why?

18:49.172 --> 18:51.505
Well, I'll be sure to ask him
when I question him.

18:51.507 --> 18:52.873
Not happening.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.474
Excuse me?

18:54.476 --> 18:56.809
Shah clearly has a beef
with the FBI

18:56.811 --> 18:58.310
for what went down
with his nephew,

18:58.312 --> 18:59.878
and you're at
the center of that.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.746
It's better for
an outside party
to do the questioning.

19:01.748 --> 19:02.747
No.

19:02.749 --> 19:04.515
If he says anything,

19:04.517 --> 19:06.316
you'll be the first to know.

19:08.820 --> 19:11.153
Right-- he killed my agents.

19:11.155 --> 19:13.354
Don't go easy on him.

19:15.658 --> 19:17.758
DEEKS:
So,

19:17.760 --> 19:19.893
Shah's nephew, uh, Naveed,
is up at Victorville.

19:19.895 --> 19:21.361
I'm gonna go over there
and talk to him,

19:21.363 --> 19:22.595
see if he knows anything

19:22.597 --> 19:23.596
about, uh, his uncle's
impending attack.

19:23.598 --> 19:24.763
All right.
I'll go with you.

19:24.765 --> 19:25.864
Yeah, no, I...
I think I'm gonna...

19:25.866 --> 19:27.799
I'm gonna probably go by myself.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.600
Okay, the last I checked,

19:29.602 --> 19:31.768
I had interrogated more
terrorists than you, so...

19:31.770 --> 19:33.603
Yeah.

19:36.741 --> 19:37.740
Interrogation?

19:37.742 --> 19:39.908
Definitely.

19:41.177 --> 19:44.611
Oh... did I,
did I say something?

19:44.613 --> 19:47.246
Did we do something wrong?

19:47.248 --> 19:49.281
I just know that
Hetty's worried.

19:52.219 --> 19:53.751
(exhales)

19:53.753 --> 19:56.220
The woman I saw
this morning.

19:56.222 --> 19:57.821
All right, who is she?

19:57.823 --> 19:59.823
Well, if you can get
Hetty to answer that,

19:59.825 --> 20:01.825
I actually will
clean your apartment.

20:02.761 --> 20:04.494
No, no, no,
don't do that.

20:04.496 --> 20:05.628
Listen, Hetty's
looking into it,

20:05.630 --> 20:08.497
so let her be worried.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.799
Okay, um...

20:10.801 --> 20:12.934
Fine.

20:12.936 --> 20:14.635
I'm gonna go
check out the auto shop

20:14.637 --> 20:15.936
and see what else
I can find.

20:15.938 --> 20:17.203
Hold on a second-- hey.
Hey, hey.

20:17.205 --> 20:18.437
What?

20:18.439 --> 20:20.172
You and I, we're good.

20:20.174 --> 20:22.507
Okay? Nothing's gonna
tear us apart.

20:22.509 --> 20:24.775
Say it.
Say "We're good."

20:24.777 --> 20:25.776
We're good.

20:25.778 --> 20:27.177
Okay.

20:30.215 --> 20:31.547
I have no intention
of retracting

20:31.549 --> 20:32.881
my confession, Agent Hanna.

20:32.883 --> 20:36.384
What I did, I did.

20:36.386 --> 20:38.886
But I did it so that
the truth would be revealed.

20:38.888 --> 20:42.456
Mr. Shaw, the only truth
we're interested in

20:42.458 --> 20:45.392
is where and when this next
attack is going to take place.

20:45.394 --> 20:47.927
That will also be revealed.

20:47.929 --> 20:50.229
But only at the right time.

20:50.898 --> 20:53.298
For now,
I'd rather you understand why.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.666
Why what?

20:54.668 --> 20:58.970
Why I had to resort to killing
to make my point.

20:58.972 --> 21:01.605
It is not a decision
I made lightly.

21:01.607 --> 21:03.807
I'm sure the families
of those dead agents

21:03.809 --> 21:05.775
will find comfort in that.

21:05.777 --> 21:08.911
I can empathize.

21:08.913 --> 21:10.846
I feel their pain.

21:10.848 --> 21:13.849
I lost my nephew to terrorism.

21:13.851 --> 21:15.350
Your nephew was a terrorist.

21:15.352 --> 21:17.385
That is a big distinction.

21:17.387 --> 21:20.554
But before this, he was a boy.

21:20.556 --> 21:22.923
This is what
I'm trying to tell you:

21:22.925 --> 21:24.824
Naveed was not a terrorist

21:24.826 --> 21:27.293
until the FBI
turned him into one.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.863
He was a good young man.

21:30.865 --> 21:32.798
He worked at my shop--

21:32.800 --> 21:36.401
helping the mechanics,
learning the register.

21:36.403 --> 21:40.838
This watch--
I gave him this watch

21:40.840 --> 21:42.940
to motivate him
to show up on time,

21:42.942 --> 21:44.741
to work quickly,

21:44.743 --> 21:47.777
take responsibility.

21:47.779 --> 21:50.980
But then the FBI came.

21:50.982 --> 21:54.917
They were the ones who
led him down that path...

21:54.919 --> 21:58.787
not some online videos
of radical imams.

21:58.789 --> 22:01.890
It was you--
your federal agents.

22:01.892 --> 22:05.727
They stopped him from
carrying out an attack.

22:05.729 --> 22:08.429
An attack they provided him.

22:10.299 --> 22:12.465
You take confused young men,

22:12.467 --> 22:14.533
and instead
of offering them help,

22:14.535 --> 22:16.768
you give them a plan.

22:16.770 --> 22:19.537
And then you sell
them a bomb.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.907
You create your own enemy,
your own terror.

22:22.909 --> 22:26.377
So, who then

22:26.379 --> 22:28.545
is the real terrorist?

22:33.851 --> 22:36.718
Super secret
Hetty project?

22:36.720 --> 22:38.953
Not so secret

22:38.955 --> 22:40.654
apparently.

22:40.656 --> 22:44.524
Did you ever think she does
this sort of thing on purpose?

22:44.526 --> 22:46.826
Keep something secret
and then leak just

22:46.828 --> 22:49.028
the right amount
of information

22:49.030 --> 22:50.529
to just the right people.

22:50.531 --> 22:52.564
You know, to see what happens.

22:52.566 --> 22:54.866
Yeah, shake things loose.

22:54.868 --> 22:56.968
Yeah, it's like...

22:56.970 --> 22:58.836
it's like losing a chess piece

22:58.838 --> 23:00.704
in order to win the game.

23:00.706 --> 23:02.539
You know I don't like
losing chess pieces.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.774
(laughs)
I know.

23:04.776 --> 23:06.375
You cried when
I took your pawn.

23:06.377 --> 23:08.643
I just feel so bad
for them, you know?

23:08.645 --> 23:11.045
We'll stick to
checkers next time.

23:11.047 --> 23:12.780
Okay.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.715
You can go now.

23:14.717 --> 23:16.783
Cool.

23:38.005 --> 23:41.339
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

23:45.044 --> 23:47.044
(tires screech)

23:52.651 --> 23:53.449
Federal agent!

23:53.451 --> 23:54.650
Get out of the car!

23:59.389 --> 24:01.021
It's okay,
I'm a cop.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.555
Identify yourself.

24:02.557 --> 24:04.423
Detective Jacqueline Rivera.

24:04.425 --> 24:06.491
LAPD Internal Affairs.

24:06.493 --> 24:09.126
Federal agents aren't
in your purview, Detective.

24:09.128 --> 24:10.594
You got that right.

24:10.596 --> 24:13.930
Could you maybe lower your gun?

24:13.932 --> 24:15.865
I thought Detective
Deeks was with you.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.733
Seems I was mistaken.

24:17.735 --> 24:18.834
No, Detective Deeks
is not with me.

24:18.836 --> 24:20.035
What do you want with him?

24:20.037 --> 24:21.903
Well, I'm afraid I can't

24:21.905 --> 24:25.039
discuss ongoing investigations
with you, Agent Blye.

24:25.041 --> 24:27.908
But if you have something
you want to tell me

24:27.910 --> 24:30.377
about your partner,

24:30.379 --> 24:32.045
here's where you can reach me.

24:32.047 --> 24:34.414
Deeks is an upstanding
police officer.

24:34.416 --> 24:35.882
The best LAPD has.

24:35.884 --> 24:37.617
You're wasting your time.

24:37.619 --> 24:39.852
He must be very special to you.

24:40.955 --> 24:44.423
You're not gonna find anything.

24:44.425 --> 24:45.457
Maybe not.

24:45.459 --> 24:47.525
Doesn't mean it isn't there.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.764
You're talking about coercion.

24:53.766 --> 24:55.632
Entrapment.

24:55.634 --> 24:58.668
My nephew's arrest was illegal.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.570
And so, these attacks, this is
your way of... avenging him?

25:01.572 --> 25:03.104
Revenge?

25:03.106 --> 25:04.805
No.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.407
Haven't you heard a word I said?

25:07.409 --> 25:10.910
Haven't you understood
the action I've taken?

25:10.912 --> 25:14.680
You killed three people
in cold blood.

25:14.682 --> 25:17.115
It's kind of hard to understand.

25:19.152 --> 25:22.686
In the first months
after Naveed was taken,

25:22.688 --> 25:25.989
I will admit I was angry.

25:25.991 --> 25:29.660
I craved revenge.

25:29.662 --> 25:33.563
But then I saw how useless
those feelings were.

25:33.565 --> 25:36.799
I learned to control them,

25:36.801 --> 25:39.735
to cast them aside
for a higher purpose.

25:40.804 --> 25:42.303
Allah.

25:43.773 --> 25:46.106
Education, Agent Callen.

25:46.108 --> 25:48.741
Education.

25:48.743 --> 25:50.743
You're teaching us a lesson.

25:51.812 --> 25:54.879
By using the FBI's
own lesson plan.

25:56.916 --> 25:59.816
Did you know that
the most terrifying plans

25:59.818 --> 26:03.653
for terrorist attacks
were not created by terrorists?

26:03.655 --> 26:05.788
They were developed here.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.756
In the United States.

26:07.758 --> 26:09.724
By the FBI.

26:09.726 --> 26:11.726
For sting operations.

26:11.728 --> 26:14.328
It is true.

26:14.330 --> 26:17.731
In fact, the undercover agent
assigned to Naveed gave him

26:17.733 --> 26:20.633
the idea to blow up
his own high school.

26:20.635 --> 26:22.801
And you plan to finish
that attack?

26:22.803 --> 26:24.035
Oh, no.

26:24.037 --> 26:26.771
That would be too personal.

26:26.773 --> 26:29.073
And as I've made clear,

26:29.075 --> 26:31.942
this is not about me.

26:31.944 --> 26:35.879
This is about showing you
the error of your ways.

26:35.881 --> 26:38.581
At 5:37 today,

26:38.583 --> 26:41.850
one of those attacks--
conceived and developed

26:41.852 --> 26:44.953
by your own government--
will finally come

26:44.955 --> 26:46.854
to fruition.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.156
You did all the work.

26:49.158 --> 26:51.758
I just followed your plan.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.640
What have you found?

27:08.642 --> 27:09.907
Last month
there was a coordinated

27:09.909 --> 27:11.308
cyber attack
on FBI servers.

27:11.310 --> 27:13.209
Tens of thousands
of documents

27:13.211 --> 27:14.910
were downloaded
and leaked online.

27:14.912 --> 27:18.213
Including classified details
of sting operations.

27:18.215 --> 27:20.782
So, it's conceivable Shah has
access to this information.

27:20.784 --> 27:22.650
It's conceivable
my nana does.

27:22.652 --> 27:24.485
Well, she's really good
at computers.

27:24.486 --> 27:26.319
You think it's possible Shah was
involved with the data breach?

27:26.322 --> 27:28.005
It's possible.

27:28.006 --> 27:29.689
However, I don't believe
it's probable.

27:29.692 --> 27:30.891
A group that splintered off
from Anonymous

27:30.893 --> 27:33.059
eventually
took responsibility.

27:33.061 --> 27:34.960
The truth is,
these sorts of hacks

27:34.962 --> 27:37.896
happen on an almost
weekly basis now.

27:37.898 --> 27:39.330
But it explains
how Shah would know

27:39.332 --> 27:41.298
about the undercover
sting operation.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.033
These are some

27:43.035 --> 27:45.735
of the attacks detailed
in the reports.

27:45.737 --> 27:47.703
Government buildings,
churches...

27:47.705 --> 27:49.738
Power plants, bridges, railways.

27:49.740 --> 27:52.707
It's like finding
a supervillain's bucket list.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.075
Start tracking Shah's
recent activity.

27:54.077 --> 27:55.176
If he's planning
something,

27:55.178 --> 27:56.677
his movements may
show what it is.

27:56.679 --> 27:58.278
You got it.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.313
Agent Conway will know more
about these attacks than anyone.

28:00.315 --> 28:01.914
I'm gonna head over to the FBI.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.382
Work with her,
narrow the targets.

28:03.384 --> 28:05.100
I'll keep pushing Shah.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.817
Let's hope Deeks can get
something out of the nephew.

28:06.820 --> 28:08.820
The clock is ticking.

28:08.822 --> 28:11.389
You're a detective?

28:11.391 --> 28:13.657
Yeah.

28:13.659 --> 28:15.425
You don't look
like they do on TV.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.661
What's... what do they
look like on TV?

28:18.663 --> 28:20.929
Like suits?

28:20.931 --> 28:22.964
You know, professional?
(laughs)

28:22.966 --> 28:25.132
Yeah, well, I learned
a long time ago

28:25.134 --> 28:27.667
that wearing a suit doesn't
make you professional.

28:28.703 --> 28:30.703
I also learned that wearing

28:30.705 --> 28:32.171
a suicide vest
doesn't necessarily

28:32.173 --> 28:33.405
make you a terrorist.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.740
Is that why you're here?

28:35.742 --> 28:37.208
Because of what I did?

28:37.210 --> 28:39.743
Or... tried to do?

28:39.745 --> 28:40.810
Actually, Naveed,
I'm here to talk

28:40.812 --> 28:42.411
about something your uncle did.

28:42.413 --> 28:45.080
I haven't spoken
to my uncle in months.

28:45.082 --> 28:46.748
Not since they sent me here.

28:46.750 --> 28:47.849
I know, I checked the log.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.750
You actually haven't had
any visitors.

28:49.752 --> 28:51.718
Except for me.

28:53.221 --> 28:56.789
He won't even talk
to me on the phone.

28:56.791 --> 28:58.857
He hangs up every time.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.461
He killed three FBI agents
this morning.

29:03.463 --> 29:07.698
He planted a bomb
inside of a van,

29:07.700 --> 29:09.766
and then he blew them up.

29:11.336 --> 29:12.702
My uncle?

29:12.704 --> 29:13.736
You're sure it was him?

29:13.738 --> 29:15.738
Yeah, he confessed.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.973
He also said that he has
another attack planned,

29:17.975 --> 29:20.408
and that it's gonna be carried
out in the next two hours.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.260
which is why I'm here.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.111
So, if you can tell us anything,
if you know anything

29:24.113 --> 29:26.113
that can help us...

29:26.115 --> 29:28.748
now is the time.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.450
I do want to help.

29:31.452 --> 29:33.452
Okay.

29:33.454 --> 29:35.320
My uncle.

29:36.389 --> 29:38.455
I want to help him kill

29:38.457 --> 29:41.458
as many federal agents
as possible.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.493
I wish that I were standing
by his side,

29:43.495 --> 29:46.496
fighting this evil country.

29:46.498 --> 29:49.031
I understand now
why he wouldn't see me.

29:49.033 --> 29:52.868
Because he was fighting
a holy war.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.770
Well, I understand now, too.

29:57.406 --> 30:00.106
Next time you see my uncle,
tell him<i> "Allahu Akbar!"</i>

30:00.108 --> 30:01.273
<i> Allahu Akbar!</i>

30:01.275 --> 30:03.340
(lock clicks)

30:06.211 --> 30:07.243
(phone ringing)

30:07.245 --> 30:08.377
Hey, Kens, what's up?

30:08.379 --> 30:10.946
Nell, I'm at Lakeview Auto.

30:10.947 --> 30:13.514
They advertise flatbed towing
as one of their services.

30:13.517 --> 30:16.184
Problem is, I only see
a wheel lift truck.

30:16.186 --> 30:18.819
Okay, let me see.

30:18.821 --> 30:21.488
Yup, Lakeview Auto does show
one flatbed truck

30:21.490 --> 30:23.356
registered to them.

30:25.059 --> 30:27.859
And it's not here.

30:27.861 --> 30:29.527
It's being used in the attack?

30:29.529 --> 30:33.364
Putting it through Kaleidoscope
and sending out a citywide APB.

30:33.366 --> 30:35.366
I'm heading back.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.038
All right, send
anyone we can spare.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.105
Got another.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.806
There's a synagogue on Olympic.

30:44.808 --> 30:47.475
It specifically targets an
Erev Yom Kippur service, but...

30:47.477 --> 30:49.276
It was five months ago.

30:49.278 --> 30:52.145
Normal services are
on Friday and Saturday.

30:52.147 --> 30:53.913
Well, better safe than sorry.

30:53.915 --> 30:57.283
And I've dispatched LAPD to
evacuate Naveed's high school.

30:57.285 --> 31:00.052
Good. It's not the target.

31:00.054 --> 31:02.487
Just because a terrorist
says it's not,

31:02.489 --> 31:04.555
doesn't mean that it isn't,
Agent Hanna.

31:04.557 --> 31:07.858
Look, Shah said that his
higher purpose was education.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.060
And that is enough for me
to keep the school in play.

31:10.062 --> 31:12.262
Shah doesn't even
have to use a bomb.

31:12.264 --> 31:14.197
By throwing hundreds of
potential targets at us,

31:14.199 --> 31:17.133
he's forcing us to evacuate
buildings all over L.A.

31:17.135 --> 31:19.435
He's achieving
his goal-- panic,

31:19.437 --> 31:22.137
fear... American-made terror.

31:22.139 --> 31:25.106
We got less than an hour
before the deadline.

31:25.108 --> 31:27.074
We may well have
to play right into his hands.

31:27.076 --> 31:29.976
(groans)

31:29.978 --> 31:32.144
Sam.
Running out of time, G.

31:32.146 --> 31:33.945
You need to break him.

31:33.947 --> 31:35.246
Sam, you heard him--
this isn't personal.

31:35.248 --> 31:37.014
He's not giving us
any ammunition.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.050
The watch.

31:41.052 --> 31:43.519
5:37-- Naveed's takedown time.

31:43.521 --> 31:46.121
It's all we've got.

31:48.825 --> 31:52.059
I'll get back to you.

31:54.029 --> 31:56.462
Naveed, your nephew?

31:56.464 --> 31:58.063
You gave him this watch.

31:58.065 --> 31:59.931
What-what was the reason again?

31:59.933 --> 32:02.566
You wanted to teach him
about, uh, being on time?

32:02.568 --> 32:06.202
To teach him about
responsibility?

32:06.204 --> 32:10.005
But here you are,
shrugging off your own.

32:10.007 --> 32:14.175
By blaming the FBI,
the-the U.S. government.

32:16.145 --> 32:18.145
The thing is...

32:18.147 --> 32:20.380
we didn't turn your nephew

32:20.382 --> 32:22.181
into a terrorist.

32:22.183 --> 32:25.150
You did.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.918
Your brother, his wife?

32:26.920 --> 32:29.020
They died believing
that their son

32:29.022 --> 32:31.455
was gonna be cared for,

32:31.457 --> 32:34.357
guided, provided
with a good life.

32:34.359 --> 32:37.326
Naveed was

32:37.328 --> 32:40.028
your responsibility...

32:40.030 --> 32:41.329
and you failed.

32:43.399 --> 32:45.098
(quiet laugh)

32:45.100 --> 32:47.333
It all makes sense now.

32:52.239 --> 32:55.940
That's why you've never gone to
visit him since he was arrested.

32:57.176 --> 33:00.143
It's why you can't bear to
speak with him on the phone.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.348
He reminds you of your failure.

33:07.285 --> 33:10.386
You can't stand to face
the monster you've created.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.287
No!

33:13.123 --> 33:16.224
Or maybe you can't
face yourself.

33:16.226 --> 33:20.194
Maybe you've been lying
this entire time.

33:20.196 --> 33:22.196
But not just to me.

33:26.735 --> 33:30.136
Higher purpose, my ass.

33:30.138 --> 33:34.173
It's never been anything
but personal with him.

33:34.175 --> 33:37.409
He wants revenge,
Mr. Callen.

33:37.411 --> 33:41.646
Simple, satisfying revenge.

33:41.648 --> 33:44.248
Making us scramble to find
the right attack plan--

33:44.250 --> 33:46.250
that was all a ruse.

33:46.252 --> 33:49.653
Meaning...

33:49.654 --> 33:53.055
the target remains the same
as this morning: the FBI.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.525
Bad news. I just found
Kensi's missing flatbed truck.

33:56.527 --> 33:59.694
That sounds like good news,
Ms. Jones.

33:59.696 --> 34:02.263
Yeah, but it just turned
off the 10 onto Palms Boulevard.

34:02.265 --> 34:04.098
It's heading for Mar Vista.

34:05.367 --> 34:07.233
The FBI Task Force office.

34:07.235 --> 34:09.235
Sam.

34:21.081 --> 34:22.713
This is not a drill, people.

34:22.715 --> 34:25.282
I need everyone out of
the back of the building now.

34:25.284 --> 34:26.816
They're moving vehicles
as a makeshift barrier,

34:26.818 --> 34:28.184
but it's not gonna be enough.

34:28.186 --> 34:29.418
I don't care about the building.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.052
I just want to get
my people out.

34:31.054 --> 34:32.386
Ryan, leave it.

34:32.388 --> 34:34.688
That means you, too,
Agent Hanna. Go.

34:34.690 --> 34:35.789
Okay.

34:35.791 --> 34:37.056
You better be right behind me.

34:37.058 --> 34:38.390
I will.

34:38.392 --> 34:40.058
Come on, everyone.

34:40.060 --> 34:42.193
The car it's carrying--
where did it come from?

34:42.195 --> 34:44.828
Belongs to Hiba Bakhzari,
resident of Baldwin Hills,

34:44.830 --> 34:47.230
and, uh, mother
of Jonathan and Omar.

34:47.232 --> 34:50.099
The FBI has been monitoring
their online activity.

34:50.101 --> 34:51.600
They've visited a number

34:51.602 --> 34:54.102
of radical Web sites
over the last year.

34:54.104 --> 34:55.803
That must be
how Shah found them.
DEEKS: Brothers again.

34:55.805 --> 34:58.205
18 and 17.
Hey, they're about
ten minutes away from the FBI.

34:58.207 --> 35:00.473
How much you want to bet they
turned that car into a bomb?

35:00.475 --> 35:01.574
Tell Sam we're
on our way.

35:01.576 --> 35:03.442
Wait. Together?

35:04.411 --> 35:07.111
But Hetty said...

35:07.113 --> 35:08.679
(sighs)

35:09.648 --> 35:11.547
This is your plan?

35:11.549 --> 35:14.149
To coerce and
manipulate kids?

35:14.151 --> 35:18.186
I told you I would use the FBI's
own methods against them.

35:18.188 --> 35:20.087
They'll die.

35:20.089 --> 35:22.122
And my point will be made.

35:22.124 --> 35:24.124
You don't have a point.

35:24.126 --> 35:26.559
You've lied to me, and
you've lied to yourself.

35:26.561 --> 35:28.227
You just can't admit it.

35:30.664 --> 35:32.530
It's okay.
They're with me.

35:32.532 --> 35:34.465
NCIS.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.100
Eric, how far away is the truck?

35:37.102 --> 35:39.135
Turning onto Inglewood.
Four minutes out.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.669
I need you to stay here

35:40.671 --> 35:42.671
and make sure the FBI
doesn't take those boys out.

35:42.673 --> 35:44.172
On it.

35:44.174 --> 35:47.108
What's the plan?
(sighs) Keep everyone alive.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.114
This is your chance, Shah.

35:55.116 --> 35:58.350
This is your chance to
take responsibility.

35:58.352 --> 36:00.318
For these boys.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.686
For what happens to them.

36:01.688 --> 36:04.889
This is your chance to be
better than your enemy.

36:07.226 --> 36:09.392
Look at them!

36:09.394 --> 36:11.227
You say you're not
about revenge,

36:11.229 --> 36:13.162
but you're also not about
teaching us a lesson,

36:13.164 --> 36:15.130
so what are you about?

36:20.370 --> 36:22.770
There.
That's them.

36:22.772 --> 36:23.904
(tires screeching)

36:33.414 --> 36:35.147
Get alongside them.

36:36.817 --> 36:38.917
You believe that your nephew
deserved more of a chance.

36:38.919 --> 36:40.518
You believe that
all of these young,

36:40.520 --> 36:42.253
misguided kids
deserve that.

36:42.255 --> 36:44.421
I do, too.

36:44.423 --> 36:46.823
Call them.

36:46.825 --> 36:48.925
Tell them to stop this.

36:48.927 --> 36:51.193
I can't.

36:52.563 --> 36:55.230
They don't
have a phone.

36:55.232 --> 36:57.632
I told them not to take one.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.266
I'm sorry.

37:00.235 --> 37:02.168
I am so sorry.

37:02.170 --> 37:05.304
Well, I guess this really is
in Allah's hands.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.372
Closer.

37:12.879 --> 37:14.278
Out the window-- good choice.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.679
All right, watch it.

37:43.441 --> 37:45.641
Get the gun.
Shoot him. Shoot him!

37:49.580 --> 37:50.912
Hey.

37:50.914 --> 37:52.647
Listen.

37:52.649 --> 37:54.749
I'm putting the gun down.

37:54.751 --> 37:56.283
Jonathan, right?

37:56.285 --> 37:57.951
Omar?

37:59.354 --> 38:00.820
Guys, my name is Sam.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.388
We got a bomb.

38:02.390 --> 38:03.822
We'll blow it.

38:03.824 --> 38:06.524
Jonathan, you got a problem.

38:06.526 --> 38:08.292
You're not gonna
complete your mission.

38:08.294 --> 38:10.394
There are agents up ahead--
they're gonna shoot you

38:10.396 --> 38:12.295
<i> and your brother</i>
<i> before you make it.</i>

38:16.301 --> 38:17.833
On my command,
you take them out.

38:17.835 --> 38:20.302
You do realize they're
just teenagers, right?

38:20.304 --> 38:22.070
With a car full of explosives.

38:22.071 --> 38:23.837
I'm just saying, give
Sam time to do his job.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.640
Detective Deeks, if that truck
reaches our driveway,

38:26.642 --> 38:28.608
I'm doing what needs to be done.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.643
The man who put you up to this--

38:30.645 --> 38:32.478
this is for his own
personal vendetta.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.980
This has nothing to do
with your beliefs.

38:34.982 --> 38:37.816
He's taken advantage of you.

38:37.818 --> 38:39.317
<i> You two have a mother, right?</i>

38:39.319 --> 38:41.886
What will she think
if you do this?

38:41.888 --> 38:44.555
You got your whole lives
ahead of you.

38:46.025 --> 38:48.625
On my mark.
No, Sam is still in
the line of fire.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.660
Get him out of here.
Sam is in the
line of fire!

38:50.662 --> 38:52.261
DEEKS:
No, no!

38:52.263 --> 38:53.695
SAM:
Give your brother a chance.

38:53.697 --> 38:55.530
Jonathan,
give yourself a chance.

38:55.532 --> 38:57.331
You don't have
to do this.

39:03.338 --> 39:04.403
DEEKS:
They're stopping!

39:04.405 --> 39:05.704
Wait. Hold your fire.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.440
It's okay, Jonathan.

39:09.442 --> 39:10.707
I'm sorry.

39:10.709 --> 39:11.774
It's okay.

39:28.058 --> 39:30.558
(sobbing)

39:30.560 --> 39:32.459
(door opens)

39:37.032 --> 39:39.499
They lived.

39:39.501 --> 39:42.001
But their lives
are over.

39:42.003 --> 39:44.069
Just like your nephew's.

39:49.342 --> 39:51.441
That's on you.

39:54.312 --> 39:56.378
Take him.

40:07.424 --> 40:10.024
You ignored my request.

40:11.394 --> 40:14.395
Well, we're partners, and...

40:14.397 --> 40:16.363
partners work together, so...

40:21.803 --> 40:25.638
Detective Jacqueline Rivera,
Internal Affairs.

40:32.078 --> 40:33.911
Why didn't you tell me?

40:35.581 --> 40:40.049
I didn't want to worry you,
Mr. Deeks, until I knew more.

40:40.051 --> 40:42.618
Hmm.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.020
So, do you know more now?

40:46.423 --> 40:48.756
It would seem that the LAPD,

40:48.758 --> 40:51.091
either on their own or...

40:51.093 --> 40:55.095
with some outside influence,

40:55.097 --> 40:58.798
has decided to open
an investigation

40:58.800 --> 41:00.499
into you.

41:02.436 --> 41:04.836
Why? What for?

41:04.838 --> 41:07.839
For now, they seem
to be playing their cards

41:07.841 --> 41:10.508
very close to the vest.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.777
And make no mistake...

41:15.113 --> 41:16.846
...they're hunting.

41:16.848 --> 41:20.682
And they will use everything
they have against you.

41:24.054 --> 41:26.120
Me.

41:27.823 --> 41:30.924
I will protect
you both

41:30.926 --> 41:34.527
the best I can,

41:34.529 --> 41:37.162
but if there is
anything else

41:37.164 --> 41:41.166
that the LAPD can use
against you, Mr. Deeks,

41:41.168 --> 41:46.571
now is the time to speak up.

41:52.178 --> 41:54.478
There's nothing.

42:04.055 --> 42:06.121
All right.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.859
Go home, both of you.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.561
Watch the shadows.

42:13.563 --> 42:16.263
This is just beginning.
