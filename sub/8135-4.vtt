00:01.248 --> 00:04.011
We're hungry. Real hungry.

00:07.454 --> 00:09.718
Your act's not only lousy, man.
It's 10 years out of date.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.350
Nobody makes a fool out of me
and gets away with it.

00:12.426 --> 00:14.394
Is that a fact?

00:17.597 --> 00:20.293
Michael, they've got Davey!

00:25.806 --> 00:28.502
We got him now, man!

00:42.989 --> 00:48.154
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:48.228 --> 00:50.219
who does not exist.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.231
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.309 --> 01:04.834
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.911 --> 01:07.937
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:08.014 --> 01:11.575
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

01:56.396 --> 01:58.330
Come on, come on!
Hurry it up!

01:58.398 --> 02:00.662
I wanna get this stuff
outta here before dawn.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.861
And look. It's almost 5:00.

02:13.246 --> 02:15.146
All right. Hold it.

02:15.215 --> 02:19.481
Four million dollars' worth
of prime coke shot to hell,

02:19.553 --> 02:21.680
and we haven't even cut it yet!

02:21.755 --> 02:24.019
Just think of it as a tax loss.

02:24.090 --> 02:27.958
You can depreciate it over the next
five years while you're in the slammer.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.997
Anyway, it's kind of hot in here,
don't you think?

02:31.064 --> 02:33.294
Let's move outside in the cool air.

02:40.907 --> 02:43.068
Oh, I see him. Thank you.

02:48.415 --> 02:50.747
Ah, hello, Devon.

02:50.817 --> 02:53.547
Michael!
What a delightful surprise.

02:53.620 --> 02:56.817
- The office told me I'd find you here.
- How very thoughtful of them.

02:58.058 --> 03:01.323
Well, now that you're here,
perhaps you'd like to order something.

03:01.394 --> 03:05.854
Yeah. Let me have a double
cheeseburger with some onions,

03:05.932 --> 03:08.298
french fries and a Coke.

03:09.703 --> 03:13.298
Oh, if you can't handle that, there's
a takeout joint across the street.

03:17.911 --> 03:20.846
- What's that?
- Escargot.

03:20.914 --> 03:25.408
An exotically flavored dish rendered
comatose by the very thought of your order.

03:25.485 --> 03:30.047
I'm not a fussy eater,
I guess, huh? But snails!

03:30.123 --> 03:33.422
Yes, I admit that it is
an acquired taste, Michael.

03:33.493 --> 03:35.723
But, then, so many things are.

03:36.997 --> 03:40.057
Well, what is it you wanted to see me
so urgently about?

03:40.133 --> 03:43.193
Well, Devon,
I'm really beat, you know?

03:43.270 --> 03:46.103
I don't doubt it.
Especially having just read...

03:46.172 --> 03:48.834
the details
of your latest assignment.

03:48.909 --> 03:51.901
KITT and I made that
as simple as possible.

03:51.978 --> 03:56.347
Nobody got hurt, and those drug pushers
are gonna be off the street for a long time.

03:56.416 --> 03:59.510
Anyway, I think I need some time off.

03:59.586 --> 04:03.249
A vacation?
What an absolutely splendid idea!

04:03.323 --> 04:05.450
Have you got any idea
of a destination?

04:05.525 --> 04:08.085
Well, I was thinking about doing
some rock climbing.

04:08.161 --> 04:10.186
Rock climbing. The Rockies...

04:10.263 --> 04:13.926
No, I hear that the Himalayas
present the greatest challenge.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.527
- Shall I call my travel agent for you?
- I wasn't thinking that big.

04:17.603 --> 04:21.130
Oh, I see. Anyway, I won't
be gone all that long.

04:21.207 --> 04:23.141
Great.

04:24.578 --> 04:28.036
My dear fellow, please don't
push yourself on my account.

04:28.114 --> 04:30.582
I mean, I'd hate you
to burn out too quickly.

04:30.650 --> 04:33.551
Yeah, I'll bet.

05:05.352 --> 05:09.812
- Oshkosh.
- Uh, Oklahoma.

05:09.889 --> 05:14.451
Wrong. We're only using place names with
a double vowel and a double consonant.

05:14.527 --> 05:18.861
Oklahoma has two sets of double vowels,
but no double consonant. If you had said...

05:18.932 --> 05:20.866
KITT?
Yes?

05:20.934 --> 05:24.097
- Shut up.
- It was your idea to play.

05:24.170 --> 05:28.436
A somewhat frivolous pastime anyway when you
could be briefing me on our mission instead.

05:28.508 --> 05:30.874
We're not on a mission.
We're on vacation.

05:30.944 --> 05:34.675
- What's a vacation?
- Well, it's kind of like an interlude...

05:34.748 --> 05:37.376
you know, to relax,
clear your head.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.112
I see.
But to what purpose?

05:40.186 --> 05:43.644
- Like I said, to relax.
- What does "relax" mean?

05:43.723 --> 05:48.217
Um, it's kinda like
when I put you in neutral.

05:48.294 --> 05:50.956
Oh. How very unproductive.

05:51.031 --> 05:53.795
Well, not for people.
Now me, I'm going rock climbing.

05:53.867 --> 05:58.236
Why? What happens when you get to
the top of whatever it is you're climbing?

05:58.304 --> 06:00.329
Nothing.

06:00.407 --> 06:03.035
Then why climb it?

06:03.109 --> 06:05.043
Because it's there.

06:05.111 --> 06:08.911
I see. Well, I suppose that makes
about as much sense as word games.

06:08.982 --> 06:12.383
- Good. I'm glad you can understand it.
- Not really.

06:12.452 --> 06:16.320
After all, word games don't attempt to defy
the laws of gravity like rock climbing,

06:16.389 --> 06:19.517
an activity which could easily
get you killed or seriously injured.

06:19.592 --> 06:22.322
I didn't know you cared.

06:22.395 --> 06:26.491
Of course I care. After all, that's
the way I was programmed, isn't it?

07:15.281 --> 07:17.613
Good morning.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.417
The night crawlers
are in the refrigerator.

07:22.489 --> 07:25.322
They're right next
to the, uh, Fudgesicles.

07:25.391 --> 07:28.622
Your mealworms are on the counter.
Don't worry, Clayton. You can pay me later.

07:28.695 --> 07:31.255
- Who's Clayton?
- Huh?

07:31.331 --> 07:35.097
- And what's a night crawler?
- Uh, a worm.

07:35.168 --> 07:37.466
I- I don't mean Clayton.

07:37.537 --> 07:40.700
Clayton is a... a very sweet old man
who comes in here every morning...

07:40.774 --> 07:43.436
to get his bait from me
about this time.

07:43.510 --> 07:47.469
- A night crawler is a worm.
- I see.

07:47.547 --> 07:49.481
I guess you're not
a fisherman, are you?

07:49.549 --> 07:52.780
No. I, uh... I always thought
it was kind of boring.

07:52.852 --> 07:57.152
Came to climb, but I've been known
to get hooked on new things.

07:57.223 --> 07:58.952
Oh.

08:00.260 --> 08:04.924
Uh, is there something I can do for you?

08:04.998 --> 08:08.627
Yeah. Uh, the sign in the window
said "homemade hamburgers."

08:08.701 --> 08:11.101
I sure could go for one
with everything on it...

08:11.171 --> 08:13.639
everything but the night crawlers.

08:13.706 --> 08:16.436
No night crawlers.
You got it.

08:16.509 --> 08:20.172
Sis! You've got to come out front
and see this car! It's...

08:20.246 --> 08:23.181
Mine. You like it?
Like it? Are you kiddin'?

08:23.249 --> 08:26.480
If you hang in till I eat,
I'll take you for a ride.

08:26.553 --> 08:28.578
Really?

08:28.655 --> 08:31.681
Uh, how would you
like this cooked?

08:31.758 --> 08:34.885
Medium.
Uh, anything else with that?

08:34.961 --> 08:38.556
- Yeah. How about some french fries? Well done.
- And anything else?

08:38.631 --> 08:42.499
- Meaningful conversation?
- Rare.

08:46.539 --> 08:50.236
Your, uh, sister
have a steady boyfriend?

08:50.310 --> 08:54.041
In this town?
She's beautiful.

08:54.113 --> 08:57.514
Yeah, I noticed.
Great body.

08:57.584 --> 09:01.247
Yeah, I noticed that too.
Ready to go?

09:01.321 --> 09:03.255
Sure.
Let's do it.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.561
Oh, could you stop up here?
I mean, if it's okay with you.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.531
Sure. How about
if I drop you off, though?

09:13.600 --> 09:16.091
I'm anxious to get settled
and check out White Rock Mountain.

09:16.169 --> 09:19.161
Okay, but I just gotta see Donny Spencer's
face when I get out of this car.

09:19.239 --> 09:22.208
He thinks he's so hot 'cause
his brother's got that dumb van.

09:31.417 --> 09:34.716
- Catch ya later.
- You got it.

10:07.587 --> 10:10.078
Hey! Come on!

10:10.156 --> 10:13.148
Hey, hey, come on! That's enough!
Knock it off! Come on!

10:13.226 --> 10:15.490
He said your car was dumb.
That's all right.

10:15.561 --> 10:18.223
It's no big deal.

10:21.200 --> 10:26.570
The only thing worse than leaning
on my van is touching my little brother.

10:26.639 --> 10:29.733
Trying to make sure
nobody gets hurt.

10:29.809 --> 10:33.142
- Is this yours?
- Yeah. What about it?

10:33.212 --> 10:36.739
I don't know. I mean...
I mean, I love it.

10:36.816 --> 10:39.944
I mean, it's so original.
Yeah?

10:40.019 --> 10:43.614
Well, yours is dumb.
Dumb, huh?

10:43.690 --> 10:47.251
Your family seems to have
a somewhat limited vocabulary.

10:47.327 --> 10:50.785
Hey, you talk about my family, you gotta
deal with the top dog! That's me!

10:50.863 --> 10:54.526
Oh, I didn't know you were the pick of
the litter. You're really looking for it.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.501
- Howdy, Lonny.
- Sheriff.

10:57.570 --> 11:01.700
- Any problem here?
- Nothing I can't handle, Sheriff.

11:01.774 --> 11:03.708
And with pleasure.

11:03.776 --> 11:07.337
Yeah, I suppose so, Lonny.
You just passin' through town, mister?

11:07.413 --> 11:10.143
Kind of. I came here
to do a little rock climbing.

11:10.216 --> 11:13.982
Oh, one of those macho types, huh?
Well, if you enjoy rock climbing,

11:14.053 --> 11:16.453
White Rock is as good as they come,
or so they say.

11:16.522 --> 11:19.150
Hey, don't let us hold you up.

11:19.225 --> 11:21.455
You askin' me
to get out of town?

11:21.527 --> 11:23.995
I'm tellin' you that it takes
two to make an argument.

11:24.063 --> 11:28.124
- And if there's only one of you in town...
- Suppose I decide to stay?

11:28.201 --> 11:32.365
I'm a peace officer, son.
With the emphasis on the word "peace."

11:32.438 --> 11:35.703
Now, like I said before,
it takes two to make an argument.

11:35.775 --> 11:40.678
- But if one of you's in jail...
- Any bets on who it'll be?

11:42.315 --> 11:46.046
- Guess I better go rock climbing, huh?
- That's what I call good thinking.

11:48.354 --> 11:52.586
Whoop! Wait a minute. I'm gonna have
to see your driver's license first.

11:53.993 --> 11:56.427
What for? Well, I've gotta
finish up this citation.

11:56.496 --> 12:00.762
You made an illegal U-turn back there.

12:02.268 --> 12:05.237
Boy, you sure did let the sheriff
push you around!

12:05.304 --> 12:08.705
What do you think I should've done? Shot
it out with him like you see in the movies?

12:08.775 --> 12:10.709
Well, no. But still...

12:10.777 --> 12:13.041
How old are you, Davey?
Ten.

12:13.112 --> 12:16.206
Well, if you want to make
11, 12 and 13 like that,

12:16.282 --> 12:19.911
you better learn there's times
to fight and times not to fight.

12:19.986 --> 12:21.920
Like when you can only win?

12:21.988 --> 12:25.014
No, that's the way bullies
like Big Lonny think.

12:25.091 --> 12:27.889
I mean only when you
don't have any other choice.

14:08.628 --> 14:11.825
Hey, you guys goin'
to some kind of costume party?

14:11.898 --> 14:15.197
That's a nice van you got there, pally.

14:15.268 --> 14:17.395
Uh, painted it myself.

14:17.470 --> 14:21.600
Got one of those,
uh, do-it-yourself kits.

14:21.674 --> 14:25.667
- That must've been fun, huh?
- Yeah, kinda.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.210
Nothin' to do around here.
You must get awful bored.

14:32.451 --> 14:35.181
I still gotta do a little stripping along...

14:35.254 --> 14:39.918
Say, fellas, what do you say we give
old smart-mouth here a fresh start?

14:42.628 --> 14:47.725
So he can kind of keep what's left
of his mind occupied like.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.894
- Ya dig?
- Right on.

15:31.244 --> 15:35.647
Well, I guess I'm ready, KITT.
See ya later.

15:35.715 --> 15:39.651
Michael, I believe there is a considerable
risk factor involved in this operation.

15:39.719 --> 15:42.620
Vacation. Vacation.
Not operation.

15:42.688 --> 15:46.749
Yes, well, don't you think you should
preprogram me in the event you don't return?

15:46.826 --> 15:49.624
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

15:50.896 --> 15:53.524
Michael, what shall I do
while you're gone?

15:53.599 --> 15:56.090
You're on vacation too, KITT.
Get some sun.

16:46.552 --> 16:48.645
Get us some beers!

16:48.721 --> 16:51.087
I bet the store is closed too.

16:51.157 --> 16:53.921
Oh, I've got some news for you, man.
It ain't gonna be for long.

16:53.993 --> 16:57.861
Let's do it now!

16:57.930 --> 17:00.990
Good morning!

17:01.067 --> 17:03.968
Hello. Now, you don't wanna
close up with all these customers.

17:04.036 --> 17:06.231
Look at this, huh?
Aren't you...

17:06.305 --> 17:09.035
Whoo, aren't you
a pretty little girl!

17:09.108 --> 17:11.166
Yes, indeed, huh?

17:11.242 --> 17:13.336
Make yourself at home!

17:17.616 --> 17:20.210
I knew this town
wasn't as boring as it looks.

17:20.286 --> 17:22.220
What's your name, sweet thing?

17:22.288 --> 17:24.222
Davey Benson,
and we're closed.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.521
Shh. Well, let me explain
something to you, little man.

17:27.593 --> 17:30.858
You see, what we got right here
is a special occasion.

17:30.930 --> 17:33.057
And we're big customers. You dig?

17:34.467 --> 17:38.164
And we're hungry. Real hungry.

18:06.799 --> 18:09.131
Dog, go away!

18:11.170 --> 18:13.434
I said go away, dog!

18:15.641 --> 18:17.871
Very well, then.
You leave me no choice.

18:21.814 --> 18:24.442
And that's known
as man's best friend.

18:29.955 --> 18:32.150
You smell real good.

18:36.061 --> 18:38.757
Knock it off, jerk!

18:43.869 --> 18:46.997
Come on, man.
We don't need that kind of trouble.

18:47.072 --> 18:49.802
Yeah, well, I think I'll just...
I'll eat something first, huh?

18:49.875 --> 18:51.809
Okay.
Yeah.

18:54.213 --> 18:56.374
Hey! Hey, it's the man!

18:57.917 --> 19:00.784
Hey, everybody.
Hey, man, just stay cool.

19:00.853 --> 19:03.754
We're just customers,
that's all. Right?

19:03.823 --> 19:07.782
I guess dessert's
gonna have to wait, huh?

19:20.005 --> 19:22.439
Welcome to town, fellas.

19:22.508 --> 19:24.840
I see you found the best
hamburgers around, huh?

19:49.235 --> 19:51.533
Well, anyway, it's nice
to see you again, Sheriff.

19:51.604 --> 19:54.004
I guess we better be splittin'
on down the road.

19:54.073 --> 19:56.940
Hey, Priest, pay the little lady
so we can get out of here, man.

19:57.009 --> 20:00.137
Wait a minute! Why don't we put it
on our American Express card?

20:00.212 --> 20:03.079
Do you recognize me?

20:03.148 --> 20:05.082
I think a 20 oughta cover it.

20:05.150 --> 20:09.644
It's not just the money! Davey,
Davey, the man's being quite fair.

20:10.723 --> 20:13.089
- Let's throw in a six-pack on the house.
- Hey!

20:13.158 --> 20:16.059
Hold it, Sheriff Bruckner!
I can't afford to...

20:16.128 --> 20:19.325
You know something, Sheriff?
That's real understanding of you.

20:19.398 --> 20:22.265
And me and the boys
appreciate that. My pleasure.

20:22.334 --> 20:25.326
Say thank you, boys.
Thank you.

20:26.639 --> 20:29.733
I'll see you again.

20:29.808 --> 20:32.003
We'll have to come back here
more often.

20:33.512 --> 20:37.778
Man! Well, why in the hell do you think
Sneaker picked this town in the first place?

20:37.850 --> 20:40.410
We can only fight
one war at a time, right?

20:40.486 --> 20:42.420
Smart thinkin'!

20:42.488 --> 20:45.423
Maybe next time we come back,
he'll deputize us all.

20:45.491 --> 20:48.619
How am I gonna carry this on a bike?
Here, carry that for me, man.

20:48.694 --> 20:52.562
Why didn't you arrest them? How could
you just let them get away with that?

20:52.631 --> 20:55.794
Arrest them for what? They
didn't do anything, did they?

20:55.868 --> 20:59.463
Well, not really, but they... You can
count your lucky stars we got off that easy.

20:59.538 --> 21:01.403
What!
Will you listen to me?

21:01.473 --> 21:04.169
You don't mess
with those kind of people.

21:04.243 --> 21:07.610
They're living out some kind of a fantasy,
and they're just lookin' for trouble.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.411
Now, they're gonna be gone soon,
and everything is gonna be back to normal.

21:11.483 --> 21:13.417
With no trouble.

21:13.485 --> 21:15.544
All we have to do
is keep our wits about us.

21:15.621 --> 21:19.079
In other words, you just would let them
get away with anything they please?

21:19.158 --> 21:21.888
In other words, it takes two
to make an argument.

21:21.961 --> 21:25.624
A confrontation could cost more than
a little petty pilfering or bad manners.

21:25.698 --> 21:28.929
A lot more!
You could call in the state police.

21:29.001 --> 21:31.970
And do what?
Arrest them for not shaving?

21:59.598 --> 22:02.192
You made it, huh?

22:02.267 --> 22:05.202
What are you doing up here,
anyway? Looking for you.

22:05.270 --> 22:08.535
There's trouble in town, and
I didn't know who to come to.

22:13.412 --> 22:16.643
- What about the sheriff?
- Him? You gotta be kidding!

22:16.715 --> 22:19.741
There's this big, mean
bunch of bikers down in town.

22:19.818 --> 22:23.254
I think they may do something to Sherry
if someone doesn't do something about it.

22:23.322 --> 22:26.519
All right. You go down.
I'll pick you up by the road to town.

22:26.592 --> 22:28.651
- Where are you going?
- To pick up my car.

22:28.727 --> 22:33.858
- What's so important about your car?
- You'd be surprised. You really would.

22:33.932 --> 22:37.060
Go on, get outta here!
I'll meet you down there.

23:01.794 --> 23:05.389
Are you all right? Michael!
Did Davey go and get you?

23:05.464 --> 23:08.228
Yeah. It's okay. It's no big deal.
I got to make the climb okay.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.234
At least somebody had a nice day.

23:10.302 --> 23:13.669
Davey told me about
what happened... everything.

23:13.739 --> 23:15.434
Are you all right, really?

23:17.176 --> 23:19.167
I'm a lot better now.

23:19.244 --> 23:22.145
Come here.

23:22.214 --> 23:24.705
I think it might be a good idea
if I stay here tonight.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.954
- They're back.
- How many?

23:34.026 --> 23:36.654
Just one, but
it's the real mean one.

23:36.729 --> 23:39.459
Wait. You're not gonna need that.

23:46.772 --> 23:49.866
Oh, that's a nice car.

23:49.942 --> 23:52.035
Yours?
Yeah.

23:53.312 --> 23:57.248
Say, you wouldn't mind if I drove it
around the block a little, would you?

23:57.316 --> 24:00.808
Well, personally, I wouldn't think
cars are your kind of scene.

24:00.886 --> 24:04.287
Oh, don't worry about that.
I can change.

24:08.026 --> 24:10.995
- It's locked.
- No. No, man.

24:12.064 --> 24:13.827
Just sticks sometimes.

24:22.908 --> 24:26.071
Oh, ah, you're a wise guy, huh?

24:33.185 --> 24:36.882
Well, I don't know how you did that,

24:38.290 --> 24:41.191
but nobody makes a fool out of me
and gets away with it.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.626
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

24:43.695 --> 24:48.132
You know, you and your buddies must've watched
too many bad movies on TV when you were kids.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.466
- Why is that?
- 'Cause your act's not only lousy, man, it's 10 years out of date.

24:52.538 --> 24:55.939
You can't be for real.
Oh, I'm for real.

24:57.242 --> 25:00.143
I'm a Scorpion, Hilly.

25:01.246 --> 25:03.771
Davey, run.
Go get the sheriff, quick.

25:03.849 --> 25:06.010
This is Stinger.

25:07.419 --> 25:09.444
You're about to be the "stingee."

25:09.521 --> 25:12.490
Before or after the commercial?

25:34.813 --> 25:37.976
I think playtime's over, pal.

25:40.485 --> 25:43.249
Michael. Get in the car. Get in the car.

25:54.933 --> 25:58.528
Hey, there was a little accident here.
I was just on my way to get some help.

25:58.604 --> 26:01.664
What happened?
Hey, man, what is going on?

26:01.740 --> 26:03.674
Tough guy, huh?

26:10.949 --> 26:14.112
- What kind of a car is this?
- Go ahead and tell her, KITT.

26:14.186 --> 26:16.746
Sorry. Allow me
to introduce myself.

26:16.822 --> 26:20.883
I am KITT, whom you may regard
as the voice of the Knight 2000.

26:24.029 --> 26:27.021
An experimental prototype vehicle,
which among other...

26:30.135 --> 26:33.036
Impervious to virtually
all forms of violence.

26:36.708 --> 26:40.701
Specifically, the chemical
formula for the alloy is simply...

26:49.054 --> 26:51.955
Hello, Sheriff.

26:52.024 --> 26:55.118
Am I glad to see you.

26:56.561 --> 27:00.930
Maybe that was the only way out of there,
but aren't you taking this a little too far?

27:00.999 --> 27:03.763
You're under arrest, Mr. Knight,
so just relax.

27:03.835 --> 27:05.860
You've gotta be kidding.
Not at all.

27:05.938 --> 27:08.463
I told you before
it takes two to make an argument.

27:08.540 --> 27:11.475
I got a lot of problems right now.
That idiot Lonny...

27:11.543 --> 27:14.706
had to smart-mouth off to those bikers,
and they trashed his van.

27:14.780 --> 27:17.248
What I don't need
is some hero coming in here...

27:17.316 --> 27:19.841
trying to grandstand
for some damsel in distress.

27:19.918 --> 27:21.852
You're really serious,
aren't you?

27:21.920 --> 27:24.821
You're gonna lock me up and let those
bikers do what they damn well please.

27:24.890 --> 27:28.621
- Up to a point, you're right.
- What is the point where you start to do something about it?

27:28.694 --> 27:31.060
That's my problem
and my responsibility.

27:31.129 --> 27:34.098
Wait a minute.
I get one phone call.

27:35.267 --> 27:37.292
What's the number?

27:37.369 --> 27:39.496
223...
Just a minute.

27:42.174 --> 27:45.974
553-0433.

27:52.517 --> 27:56.544
The circuits are busy.
I'll let you call again later.

27:56.621 --> 27:58.885
How much later?
A whole lot later.

27:58.957 --> 28:02.051
Yeah, that figures!
By the way, where's my car?

28:02.127 --> 28:04.322
Impounded.

28:04.396 --> 28:09.060
Those darn bikers. Somebody oughta
find out what they're doing around town.

28:09.134 --> 28:12.865
You listen to me. I don't want you
to go anywhere near those bikers.

28:12.938 --> 28:14.872
They're a real mean bunch, okay?

28:14.940 --> 28:18.273
Yeah, sis, but with Michael in jail,
somebody's gotta do something.

28:18.343 --> 28:21.176
Hey, I don't care about somebody!
All I care about is you!

28:21.246 --> 28:23.510
And I don't wanna hear that
you've been anywhere near them.

28:23.582 --> 28:26.050
You get the message?

28:28.220 --> 28:30.154
I mean it, you know.

28:42.567 --> 28:45.331
I want everybody's ride
in ace shape, okay, man?

28:45.404 --> 28:48.430
You got it.
What? What'd you say?

28:48.507 --> 28:52.603
You listen up, man! I don't want
any more trouble out of you!

28:52.677 --> 28:54.872
- What about the chick?
- Afterwards.

28:54.946 --> 28:58.848
- What are you laughing at, you freak?
- Hey, listen up, everybody.

28:58.917 --> 29:01.977
Them Dogs are gonna be riding
in here tomorrow.

29:02.054 --> 29:05.114
Now, we can only fight
one war at a time.

29:05.190 --> 29:07.954
So I want everybody ready.
You dig?

29:08.026 --> 29:11.154
You dig?

29:17.102 --> 29:19.036
Sheriff?

29:20.639 --> 29:23.472
What?
I've been thinkin'.

29:23.542 --> 29:27.069
If you deputize me, at least I'll
be available if you need some help.

29:27.145 --> 29:29.079
Son, you just get yourself some rest,

29:29.147 --> 29:31.877
and if I need you,
I'll know exactly where to find you.

29:31.950 --> 29:34.714
- I'm goin' out on night patrol.
- Do me a favor, will you?

29:34.786 --> 29:37.254
- What?
- Check on Davey and Sherry.

29:41.059 --> 29:43.789
KITT, where are you?

29:43.862 --> 29:47.195
- Impounded, Michael, just like you.
- Can you get out?

29:47.265 --> 29:49.893
Of course. Do you want me
to come get you out?

29:49.968 --> 29:53.961
- No, no. I can handle that myself.
- Are you quite sure?

29:54.039 --> 29:57.770
Yeah, I'm sure.
Any more questions?

29:57.843 --> 30:00.812
Just one.
Are we still on vacation?

30:58.770 --> 31:01.568
Oh, did it move for you too?

32:21.653 --> 32:23.951
Are we, as they say,
getting out of town?

32:24.022 --> 32:27.116
No. We're gonna find the Scorpions
and see what they're up to.

33:10.735 --> 33:14.171
- KITT, wait here.
- Are you sure?

33:14.239 --> 33:16.639
I don't think you could pass
as a motorcycle.

33:16.708 --> 33:20.576
- It would be a problem.
- Listen, if I don't make it back,

33:20.645 --> 33:23.341
go find Davey and Sherry
and take 'em out of White Rock.

33:23.415 --> 33:27.943
You're the driver. But on the whole, I think
it would be preferable if you did come back.

33:28.019 --> 33:29.316
Thanks.

33:56.281 --> 33:58.010
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

33:58.083 --> 34:00.017
- Salmon chanted.
- Who?

34:00.085 --> 34:02.519
- Salmon chanted.
- Salmon chanted...

34:09.194 --> 34:11.219
You got some fire, my man?

34:13.297 --> 34:15.766
Come on, man.
I ain't got all night.

34:21.072 --> 34:23.370
All right. Thanks, brother.

34:27.812 --> 34:30.212
The Road Dogs are gonna fall, man!

34:31.815 --> 34:36.650
I, myself, personally
are gonna take off half their heads!

34:36.721 --> 34:40.179
What about you turkeys?
Can you handle the other half, huh?

34:40.257 --> 34:42.192
Yeah!
They'll never know what hit 'em.

34:42.260 --> 34:46.253
Biggest biker war on the West Coast.
We're gonna put this place on the map.

34:47.599 --> 34:50.762
Hey, you know that chick at the store?
I still want a part of her, man.

34:50.835 --> 34:54.565
Hey. Later, okay?

34:54.639 --> 34:57.107
I promise. All right?

34:57.175 --> 34:59.370
Hey, let's party.

34:59.444 --> 35:02.140
Give me a beer.

35:05.550 --> 35:10.613
- KITT, looks like we got ourselves a real problem.
- Would you care to share it with me?

35:10.688 --> 35:13.987
Those bikers are planning
a full-scale gang war tomorrow.

35:14.058 --> 35:17.289
If that's a problem, it would appear
to be a self-solving problem.

35:17.362 --> 35:20.160
Like how?
Like why do we care who wins?

35:20.231 --> 35:23.564
Because they're planning on using
the town as the battlefield. That's why.

35:23.635 --> 35:26.331
Yes, I see.
It could make a difference at that.

35:26.404 --> 35:29.066
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to do something about it, then.

35:29.140 --> 35:31.665
- Got any ideas?
- I thought I'd let you try first.

35:31.743 --> 35:36.680
It always makes you feel so much better
on those rare occasions when you outthink me.

35:36.748 --> 35:40.309
Oh, that's funny.
That's-That's very funny.

36:09.848 --> 36:13.511
Look what I found!

36:13.585 --> 36:18.454
Her little, bitty baby kid brother!
Well, isn't he cute, huh?

36:29.534 --> 36:33.561
Michael, why don't you let me go in alone
and explain to the sheriff what happened?

36:33.638 --> 36:36.129
Because it's more believable
if it comes from me.

36:36.207 --> 36:38.402
But suppose he tries to put you
right back in jail?

36:38.476 --> 36:41.707
He won't.
Not after what I tell him.

36:47.585 --> 36:50.520
That's for good luck. Come on.

36:57.896 --> 37:01.992
Never mind, Bernie.
The problem just took care of itself.

37:02.066 --> 37:05.399
I'll see if I can arrange
some kind of a reward for you, Sherry,

37:05.470 --> 37:07.461
for apprehending the prisoner.

37:07.539 --> 37:11.339
Oh, come on, Sheriff. He is not a criminal.
A few hours ago, I might've believed you.

37:11.409 --> 37:15.038
Since then, he has stolen his vehicle
from the impound lot and broken out of jail.

37:15.113 --> 37:17.047
I didn't steal my car.

37:17.115 --> 37:20.243
Oh, I suppose you want me to believe that
it drove itself over here and picked you up.

37:20.318 --> 37:23.185
You don't know it yet, but you got
a serious problem on your hands.

37:23.254 --> 37:27.884
The only problem I've got is you. Anything
else you might say, save it for the judge.

37:27.959 --> 37:31.395
Now, listen to me. The Scorpions
are planning a gang war at White Rock.

37:31.462 --> 37:34.124
Some other guys, the Road Dogs,
are on their way here right now.

37:34.198 --> 37:36.792
If you don't believe me,
check it out with the highway patrol.

37:36.868 --> 37:39.029
A gang war?
In White Rock?

37:39.103 --> 37:42.129
It's true! And we've
got to do something about it!

37:42.206 --> 37:45.039
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put this lunatic...

37:45.109 --> 37:47.043
back in a cell where he belongs.

37:47.111 --> 37:50.547
Why would I break out of jail
and come back here and lie to you?

37:50.615 --> 37:53.277
I don't know you, mister,
and White Rock doesn't know you either.

37:53.351 --> 37:57.583
There's not gonna be a White Rock
in 24 hours if you don't listen to me.

37:57.655 --> 38:00.556
Look, he's telling you the truth!

38:00.625 --> 38:04.220
- You got a fast choice to make, Sheriff.
- What's that?

38:04.295 --> 38:07.093
Either you go along with me
and help me save the town...

38:07.165 --> 38:08.962
Or?

38:09.033 --> 38:11.433
Or I'm gonna try and save
the town without you.

38:37.428 --> 38:41.194
I knew that guy
was gonna be trouble.

38:41.265 --> 38:43.460
Hey, you guys, wake up!
Wake up!

38:45.103 --> 38:47.663
Hey, Monk, wake up.
Wake up, Monk.

38:54.679 --> 38:57.307
You sure you want to stay
in the car?

38:57.382 --> 39:01.443
Well, Sally Field stayed in the car
in Smokey and the Bandit.

39:02.754 --> 39:05.154
I think I'm safer with you, anyway.

39:05.223 --> 39:07.885
You sure about that?
No.

39:24.609 --> 39:27.407
Morning, boys.
Rise and shine.

39:27.478 --> 39:30.504
The lady here wants to see
what the animals are like...

39:30.581 --> 39:32.674
when the zoo's still closed.

39:32.750 --> 39:36.413
So you wanna see
what the animals look like, huh?

39:36.487 --> 39:40.685
Hey, if you want the kid, man,
get out of the car and we'll talk.

39:40.758 --> 39:44.854
Oh, no. Michael, they've got Davey!

39:44.929 --> 39:48.160
Hey, come on, punk.
I'm waitin' for you, man!

39:48.232 --> 39:50.598
God, Michael.
What are we gonna do?

39:50.668 --> 39:53.296
Come on, man! I'm waitin'!
Get out! Get out!

39:53.371 --> 39:55.601
Just watch.

39:55.673 --> 39:58.506
Okay, KITT, buddy,
let's shake 'em up.

40:15.426 --> 40:17.394
Go! Go!

40:39.183 --> 40:41.674
How'd they get you, Davey?
It was kinda dumb, I guess.

40:41.753 --> 40:45.689
I was sneakin' around the camp just to see
what they were gonna do, and I got caught.

40:45.757 --> 40:48.248
Oh, Davey, are you all right?
I'm fine.

40:48.326 --> 40:51.159
Hey, this is some kind of car!
It didn't look like this before.

40:51.229 --> 40:53.891
We're playin' for keeps now, Davey.

40:55.032 --> 40:57.432
Well, what are we gonna do?

40:57.502 --> 40:59.629
We're gonna play a little chicken
with the Scorpions.

41:05.877 --> 41:09.779
We got him now, man.
He's on our kind of ground, baby.

41:09.847 --> 41:11.815
Hyperspace!

42:35.566 --> 42:39.900
Hey, you're not gonna stop?

42:39.971 --> 42:42.269
Not at the moment.

43:47.972 --> 43:51.772
You did it! We did it!
We got 'em on the run!

43:54.045 --> 43:57.446
Not yet.
I'd rather have them chasing me.

44:13.998 --> 44:17.593
Aren't you going
just a little fast?

44:21.739 --> 44:24.173
Sally Field trusted Burt Reynolds.

44:25.309 --> 44:27.470
Right.

44:27.545 --> 44:29.809
I sure hope
the sheriff came through.

44:29.880 --> 44:33.782
Don't worry about it. All you
gotta do is... I know. Just hold on.

44:56.107 --> 44:59.235
We did it!
We finally showed those punks!

44:59.310 --> 45:03.178
I think they did it to themselves,
Davey, with maybe a little help from us.

45:06.884 --> 45:09.546
Son, I owe you an apology.

45:09.620 --> 45:14.080
I guess I'm not only a peace officer.
I'm also a law enforcement officer.

45:14.158 --> 45:16.592
The accent on "enforcement."

45:16.660 --> 45:18.924
No harm done, Sheriff.

45:18.996 --> 45:22.762
At least not to anybody
who didn't have it coming.

45:22.833 --> 45:27.202
- I'd appreciate it if you'd help me tidy up a bit.
- You got it. Happy to oblige.

45:27.271 --> 45:30.434
Thanks a lot.

45:55.633 --> 45:58.796
I think you might've made
a wrong turn back there!

45:58.869 --> 46:02.600
You can see what happened
to the last gang that came through here.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.998
- Oh, Devon.
- Oh, Michael!

46:32.069 --> 46:34.264
Back so soon?

46:34.338 --> 46:38.172
Well, sit down and regale me with
the lurid details of your vacation.

46:38.242 --> 46:40.802
Well, it wasn't much
of a vacation after all.

46:40.878 --> 46:44.905
Yes, I know. We received the state
police report only this morning.

46:44.982 --> 46:47.883
You don't seem to be able
to low-profile it anywhere, do you?

46:47.952 --> 46:49.886
I'm just lucky, I guess.

46:49.954 --> 46:54.755
There are those who might say that "disaster
prone" would be a better way of putting it.

46:54.825 --> 46:57.157
Do have a little wine.
Thanks.

46:57.228 --> 47:01.460
Anyway, I think it should count
as a Foundation mission,

47:01.532 --> 47:03.523
even though it was
sort of coincidental.

47:03.601 --> 47:08.197
Very well. I'll put yet another
gold star upon your report card,

47:08.272 --> 47:11.002
and I'll okay your expenses...
Within reason, of course.

47:11.075 --> 47:13.942
Well, I'd rather have some
time off, if you don't mind.

47:14.011 --> 47:17.538
Another vacation?
What a splendid idea!

47:17.615 --> 47:21.517
Yes, you do need to revitalize
the tissues, you know.

47:21.585 --> 47:26.113
Go ahead. And as I said before,
don't hurry back.

47:26.190 --> 47:28.420
Thanks. I'll see ya.

47:31.929 --> 47:36.798
That's funny. He didn't even
argue with me this time.

47:43.307 --> 47:45.775
Well? What did he say?

47:45.843 --> 47:48.038
He said to take
all the time I wanted.

47:48.112 --> 47:50.307
What a nice man.

47:50.381 --> 47:52.315
Mmm.

47:54.418 --> 47:58.013
Am I safe in assuming that nobody
wants to play Geography at the moment?

47:58.088 --> 48:01.421
Yes. You're right.
Just keep driving.

48:01.492 --> 48:03.824
But for how long?

48:03.894 --> 48:07.159
Till one of us runs out of gas. Mmm.
