05:47.823 --> 05:49.032
Can I make the call now?

06:02.421 --> 06:04.172
Gotta make it look real.

06:11.888 --> 06:14.266
Do it quick, before you pass out.

06:50.892 --> 06:52.144
And?

06:52.310 --> 06:54.980
What if I told you you could
turn this piece of crap into four grand?

06:55.147 --> 06:56.565
For each of us.

06:56.732 --> 06:58.025
Minimum.

06:58.608 --> 07:02.446
This little fella,
he's called the "Merry Wanderer."

07:02.612 --> 07:07.117
He's not much to look at, he's easy to find.
I got this one at a pawn shop for 20 bucks.

07:07.284 --> 07:10.871
But he has a cousin
called "Bavarian Boy."

07:11.038 --> 07:12.247
Almost identical.

07:12.414 --> 07:15.250
Same umbrella, same swagger.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.170
That one is worth a boatload.

07:18.336 --> 07:21.673
And I gather you know
where to find a "Bavarian Boy"?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.008
I do indeed.

07:23.175 --> 07:26.595
He's gathering dust on a shelf
in an office up on San Mateo.

07:26.762 --> 07:30.599
He's been there for God knows how long.
They have no idea what they got.

07:30.766 --> 07:35.270
To them, it's not "Bavarian Boy,"
it's "some junk Grandma gave me...

07:35.437 --> 07:38.315
I feel too guilty to get rid of."
That's where you come in.

07:38.482 --> 07:41.902
This place, they're not exactly
what you call "security-conscious."

07:42.069 --> 07:44.071
There's no cameras whatsoever.

07:44.237 --> 07:47.157
There's an alarm on the door
that I could probably bridge.

07:47.324 --> 07:50.952
And past that, you just pick a lock,
walk over to the shelf...

07:51.119 --> 07:54.873
swap this Wanderer for that Boy,
and it's five minutes, max.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.625
Warm up, gentlemen?

07:56.792 --> 07:58.335
Yeah, thanks, Fran.

07:58.502 --> 08:01.046
- Oh, thanks.
- That's cute.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.923
Isn't it, though?

08:03.215 --> 08:05.675
Have your food up in a jiff, Mike.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.222
Look, they're not
even gonna know it's gone.

08:10.388 --> 08:13.141
They look at the shelf, they see
the same dumb tchotchke...

08:13.308 --> 08:15.227
they've been looking at for years.

08:15.393 --> 08:18.980
There's no serial number.
These things are practically untraceable.

08:19.397 --> 08:22.109
You send Pryce
or some other schlub to Dallas...

08:22.275 --> 08:24.361
Next week, they have
a collectibles expo.

08:24.528 --> 08:27.030
Those people are hungry for Hummels.

08:27.197 --> 08:29.908
Their eyes are gonna pop
when they see what we brung them.

08:30.075 --> 08:34.621
And they will pay through the nose,
which we will split fifty-fifty.

08:34.788 --> 08:37.624
So it's perfect, right?

08:37.832 --> 08:39.918
We make some nice
Hummel-loving lady happy...

08:40.085 --> 08:41.669
and we make a bundle.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.297
Let's do something beautiful here.

08:45.006 --> 08:49.594
And how did you come across
this valuable wunderkind?

08:50.470 --> 08:53.807
- What difference does it make?
- Guys in the office cross you?

08:53.974 --> 08:55.517
Done you wrong?

08:55.684 --> 08:57.269
What?

08:58.436 --> 09:02.107
You're missing the point.
It's free money.

09:02.274 --> 09:06.403
You walk by a 20 on the sidewalk?
No, you pick it up.

09:10.407 --> 09:12.701
- Pass.
- What? Why?

09:12.868 --> 09:15.036
It's not for me.

09:15.620 --> 09:16.705
Not for you?

09:17.414 --> 09:22.002
Is there some problem I'm not seeing,
like, with the swap or something?

09:22.169 --> 09:25.881
The plan's fine as far as it goes.
It's just not for me.

09:26.047 --> 09:29.176
And I don't think
it should be for you either.

09:31.386 --> 09:34.014
I'm sorry about your brother.

09:34.848 --> 09:38.310
Yeah, thanks.
You're really not gonna do this?

09:38.476 --> 09:39.936
Sorry.

09:42.105 --> 09:44.065
- Eggs, easy.
- Thanks, Fran.

09:44.232 --> 09:47.402
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, I'm good.

09:47.652 --> 09:51.531
- Sure I can't get you anything?
- No, I'm not hungry. Thanks.

09:55.243 --> 09:56.745
All right.

09:57.454 --> 09:59.456
I...

10:00.707 --> 10:03.668
If you don't want easy money,
that's your business.

10:03.835 --> 10:07.839
I just thought I'd give you first crack
at a golden opportunity.

10:09.341 --> 10:10.967
All right. See you around.

10:13.345 --> 10:15.472
You take it easy.

10:20.894 --> 10:21.937
Yes, hello.

10:22.103 --> 10:25.815
I was wondering if Dr. Caldera
had any openings today?

10:25.982 --> 10:29.486
As soon as possible.
I have a very sick fish.

12:13.987 --> 12:16.698
Thanks. And thanks again for the lift.

12:16.865 --> 12:19.993
- It's outside your job description, I know.
- It's no problem.

12:20.244 --> 12:21.662
So the acquisitions?

12:21.828 --> 12:25.123
Yes. We'll need to draft contracts
for the target banks.

12:25.290 --> 12:28.710
The idea is to have the agreements
ready to go while doing due diligence.

12:28.877 --> 12:31.547
You want me to start cracking
on a draft when we're done?

12:31.713 --> 12:33.590
No, but thank you.

12:33.757 --> 12:35.801
I'll do the first pass,
then you can proof it.

12:35.884 --> 12:37.761
Sure, whatever's best for you.

12:40.305 --> 12:42.933
Here's what I'm thinking:
Looking at the competition...

12:43.100 --> 12:44.518
one opportunity stands out.

12:44.685 --> 12:47.062
They don't have
the market share, but...

12:47.229 --> 12:49.731
And this is a big deal.
Walker Ridge is eager.

12:49.898 --> 12:50.983
I agree.

12:51.149 --> 12:55.028
They took a hit in the market adjustment.
They're vulnerable and they know it.

12:55.195 --> 12:57.614
We should prepare a package
for both with that...

12:57.781 --> 12:59.533
Is that Kim Wexler I hear?

13:00.242 --> 13:02.411
Kevin. It's good to see you.

13:02.578 --> 13:05.330
Heard you were here, wanted to say hi.
Look at you.

13:05.497 --> 13:07.541
Baby bird with a broken wing.

13:07.708 --> 13:10.377
It's fine. It doesn't even hurt.
Just a pain in the butt.

13:10.544 --> 13:13.255
Kevin, this is Viola Goto,
my new paralegal.

13:13.422 --> 13:16.258
- Kevin Wachtell. Welcome to the team.
- Nice to meet you.

13:16.425 --> 13:19.761
Listen, Kim, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Charles McGill.

13:20.137 --> 13:22.472
It's no secret I had problems
with the man...

13:22.639 --> 13:24.808
but no one should go like that.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.644
I just have to ask,
how's James handling it?

13:28.103 --> 13:31.356
Oh, he's... He's getting through it.

13:31.523 --> 13:34.276
He and the family appreciated
the arrangement you sent for the funeral.

13:34.484 --> 13:37.779
- Good. Well, glad to hear.
- Kevin, we're meeting the board at noon...

13:37.946 --> 13:41.700
- to go over Kim's recommendations, so...
- No, no, no. I won't slow you down.

13:42.451 --> 13:45.537
Oh, one more thing.
And this will just take a second.

13:46.079 --> 13:48.415
Kim, you have got to see the models.

13:49.541 --> 13:52.628
The models?

13:57.341 --> 13:59.509
Takes your breath away, doesn't it?

14:01.553 --> 14:02.596
Look at this.

14:02.763 --> 14:06.642
The whole side of this building is glass.
And it's on a north-facing lot.

14:06.808 --> 14:09.561
I'm told that's energy-efficient,
so I'm excited.

14:09.728 --> 14:11.813
This is Salt Lake City?

14:11.980 --> 14:14.483
After Provo, why not?

14:15.442 --> 14:19.071
And Cheyenne, Wyoming?

14:19.237 --> 14:20.530
Yep.

14:20.697 --> 14:23.033
Over here, North Platte, Nebraska.

14:23.825 --> 14:25.369
Now, these two you already know.

14:25.535 --> 14:27.621
This one's gonna be Ogden, Utah...

14:27.788 --> 14:29.956
this one here is Tucumcari.

14:30.374 --> 14:33.335
And over here on this side,
you got a few new ones.

14:33.502 --> 14:36.338
Sedona. Pueblo, Colorado.

14:36.505 --> 14:39.424
And you know what?
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

14:39.591 --> 14:43.470
After that, I figure, why not Las Vegas?
Nevada, I mean. Reno too.

14:43.929 --> 14:45.389
Lubbock, Texas.

14:45.555 --> 14:48.850
Amarillo, San Antonio, El Paso.

14:49.017 --> 14:51.561
We're gonna get up
to the Pacific Northwest.

14:51.728 --> 14:53.397
Boise. Bend, Oregon.

14:53.563 --> 14:56.692
Eugene, Salem,
all the way up to Portland.

14:57.943 --> 15:00.362
Now, this one is real special.

15:00.529 --> 15:02.322
Denver. See here?

15:02.489 --> 15:04.741
We're gonna add
more trees on the west side.

15:04.908 --> 15:07.327
That'll be great. And then, maybe...

15:07.494 --> 15:10.539
a bench or two on the outside.
Kim, is there something wrong?

15:10.706 --> 15:12.416
No. No, no.

15:12.582 --> 15:13.875
No, it's just...

15:15.168 --> 15:19.548
It's a lot. It's a very fast,
aggressive expansion.

15:19.715 --> 15:21.925
Kevin figures
once we get a foothold in Utah...

15:22.092 --> 15:24.594
- then we'll file for federal charter.
- Yeah.

15:24.761 --> 15:27.514
We're really building something here.

15:27.681 --> 15:29.766
All your hard work
is making a difference.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.894
I mean, Kim, this is what it's all about.

15:33.854 --> 15:36.940
So I can get the notes to you
by EOD, if that's okay.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.859
Oh, yeah. That's fine.

15:39.025 --> 15:42.404
Do you have a sense
when I should expect your draft?

15:42.571 --> 15:44.489
I assume you're dictating it?

15:51.163 --> 15:53.457
Actually, you were right before.

15:53.832 --> 15:56.084
You take a stab at it,
then I'll take a look.

15:56.251 --> 15:59.880
Great. That works. I'll start on that
right after I get you home.

16:00.130 --> 16:03.675
Instead of taking me home, drop me off
at the courthouse, would you?

16:03.842 --> 16:06.636
I didn't realize you had an appearance.
I would've prepped.

16:06.803 --> 16:07.929
No, no. I don't.

16:08.096 --> 16:09.598
- You don't?
- Nothing to prep.

16:09.765 --> 16:11.349
Don't worry about it.

16:14.019 --> 16:15.520
Yeah.

16:16.021 --> 16:17.564
No.

16:20.275 --> 16:22.611
No. Not quite.

16:22.819 --> 16:26.198
I... I've done business
with him before, yeah.

16:26.364 --> 16:28.283
Once. Once.

16:28.492 --> 16:30.035
Just the once.

16:31.953 --> 16:35.665
Yeah. No. Yeah, I guess.

16:35.832 --> 16:37.793
- I don't know. He didn't say.
- Well?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.503
Yeah, he's not into it.

16:39.669 --> 16:42.464
He's not into it or you're not into it?
Give me that.

16:42.756 --> 16:45.509
Doesn't work that way.
No direct contact, that's the point.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.344
Just give it to me.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.347
Hey, this is the interested party.

16:50.514 --> 16:54.017
I have one question for you:
Do you shit gold?

16:54.184 --> 16:58.772
It's a simple "yes" or "no."
Do you shit gold?

16:59.397 --> 17:00.607
No? All right, then.

17:00.774 --> 17:04.152
Because unless you currently have
a gold nugget traversing your colon...

17:04.319 --> 17:06.445
this is the easiest money
you'll ever make.

17:06.613 --> 17:10.242
How long does it take for you
to pick a Yale three-pin?

17:10.659 --> 17:13.118
Then, in eight minutes,
you're gonna make four grand.

17:13.286 --> 17:15.038
Ten minutes if you pick your nose.

17:15.204 --> 17:19.125
In, out, no one comes looking for you.
Ever. How does that sound?

17:20.502 --> 17:23.547
Yeah, I know where that is. Here. Pen.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.760
In a half an hour.

17:28.969 --> 17:30.345
Yeah.

17:32.722 --> 17:36.434
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job, but...

17:39.604 --> 17:42.440
- All right, Mr. McGill, you're all set.
- Thank you very much.

17:42.607 --> 17:45.694
- See you next time.
- I hope she feels better soon.

17:47.487 --> 17:49.030
Excuse me.

17:57.539 --> 17:58.707
Can I help you?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.510
Jesus.

18:09.094 --> 18:12.848
All right, not here. Let me go
grab my bag and tell my staff.

18:13.724 --> 18:15.225
Jesus.

18:32.868 --> 18:36.538
Can you not hit
every damn pothole, please?

18:56.809 --> 19:00.187
Careful. Careful.

19:03.607 --> 19:05.484
Up, up.

19:14.326 --> 19:17.413
You, ayuda. Come here. Help.

20:11.049 --> 20:13.427
Well, well. There he is.

20:15.721 --> 20:17.431
You woke up.

20:17.973 --> 20:20.225
That means
my Spanish is good enough...

20:20.392 --> 20:22.686
and Yul Brynner here
is actually O-negative.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.354
Okay.

20:24.521 --> 20:26.732
I had to leave a bullet in your shoulder.

20:26.899 --> 20:29.026
It might set off metal detectors
from now on.

20:29.193 --> 20:33.447
Gave you a dose
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

20:33.739 --> 20:35.324
Let's see.

20:37.493 --> 20:42.289
Pulse is good. Now, sniff test says you
probably didn't perforate your bowel.

20:42.456 --> 20:43.874
Probably.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.627
I can't be 100 percent sure
you didn't get nicked.

20:46.794 --> 20:50.380
If this starts to leak, you're gonna
get the worst infection of your life.

20:50.672 --> 20:54.176
It's gonna hurt like hell,
and then you're gonna die.

20:54.343 --> 20:59.139
So I advise you to go see a doctor
that has some imaging tech...

20:59.556 --> 21:03.268
in other words, one that's not
working out of the back of a Jiffy Lube.

21:03.852 --> 21:06.897
Until then, keep these clean and dry.

21:07.064 --> 21:10.192
Change the bandages daily.

21:11.443 --> 21:13.362
You should be okay.

21:13.529 --> 21:14.822
You understand me?

21:18.700 --> 21:20.244
Good.

21:24.248 --> 21:26.542
Now, understand this:

21:26.708 --> 21:29.086
After I walk out of here...

21:29.253 --> 21:32.506
I never wanna see you again.

21:32.673 --> 21:33.799
Never.

21:34.007 --> 21:38.428
This cartel shit is too hot for me.

21:38.595 --> 21:40.430
You got it?

24:46.825 --> 24:47.951
It's me.

24:48.118 --> 24:49.870
Can we talk, please?

24:50.037 --> 24:52.998
I... I just wanna come home.

24:53.623 --> 24:56.334
Okay. Thank you.

24:56.835 --> 24:59.796
I... I just wanted to say...

24:59.963 --> 25:02.299
I'm sorry if you feel upset.

25:02.466 --> 25:08.472
It was not my intention
for you to feel upset.

25:10.098 --> 25:13.060
My intention was for...

25:14.019 --> 25:18.273
Honey, it is top-of-the-line.

25:22.319 --> 25:23.737
Then, what is the point?

25:23.904 --> 25:27.157
You're saying I'm a thoughtless...
That I don't care...

25:27.324 --> 25:33.288
but it is a very,
very expensive vacuum.

25:34.748 --> 25:36.750
It never loses suction.

25:36.917 --> 25:39.336
What you're saying is,
I gotta sleep in my office...

25:39.503 --> 25:42.005
because I got you a gift?

25:42.297 --> 25:43.757
Lynette?

25:45.258 --> 25:46.760
Lynette?

25:49.429 --> 25:51.139
Damn it.

26:08.198 --> 26:09.324
Hello.

26:09.491 --> 26:11.576
Are you still delivering?

26:13.495 --> 26:14.871
Okay.

26:20.252 --> 26:23.088
Yeah, just a large cheese.

26:23.421 --> 26:25.799
Yes, sliced, please.

26:25.966 --> 26:28.969
Could you also
throw in some dipping sticks?

26:30.095 --> 26:32.848
Two ranch and one marinara.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.335
Hey. How'd it go?

27:03.211 --> 27:05.130
Listen. Listen.

27:05.297 --> 27:08.216
Look, the office guy. He's here.

27:08.383 --> 27:11.011
- What?
- He's dug in for the night, man.

27:11.219 --> 27:13.722
Come get me or... Come get me.

27:27.863 --> 27:31.450
Now, if you take out the listener's guide
that came with the program...

27:31.617 --> 27:34.370
you'll see a chart in there
showing four quadrants...

27:34.536 --> 27:37.748
I call
"the time management matrix."

27:37.915 --> 27:42.044
The key words to understand
are "importance" and "urgency."

27:42.211 --> 27:45.714
"Importance" basically
comes from within you.

27:45.881 --> 27:49.635
"Importance" is your value system,
hopefully based on principles.

27:50.177 --> 27:51.762
"Importance" is your mission.

27:52.012 --> 27:54.473
- Importance versus...
- Your central strategy...

27:54.640 --> 27:56.642
to accomplish
those high-priority goals.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.937
- Urgency.
- And the plans to implement that strategy.

28:00.104 --> 28:03.607
Urgency comes from the environment.
It presses upon you.

28:03.774 --> 28:08.445
It's proximate. It's right in front of you.
And it's often very popular.

28:08.612 --> 28:10.781
It could be deep and...

29:00.414 --> 29:02.666
Son of a bitch.

29:40.329 --> 29:45.417
"It's urgent" has the appearance
of requiring immediate attention.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.296
Now, you have to decide
what is truly important in your life.

30:03.977 --> 30:06.438
Hey. Hey!

30:06.897 --> 30:08.148
Hey!

30:08.690 --> 30:10.192
Hey! Stop!

30:10.609 --> 30:11.902
Stop! No, no!

30:12.152 --> 30:13.278
No!

30:15.072 --> 30:17.908
Hey! No! No! Why? Why? Stop! Stop!

30:18.075 --> 30:20.452
No, stop! Stop!

30:31.171 --> 30:34.299
Hey, hey. So did you get it?

30:34.466 --> 30:36.802
Shitting gold.

30:37.094 --> 30:38.971
Yeah. Yeah, right?

30:39.138 --> 30:41.765
I didn't say it was easy.
Car thing was pretty slick.

30:41.932 --> 30:43.809
Don't know how you pulled that off.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.435
Worked, didn't it?

30:45.602 --> 30:47.646
Yeah, guess so.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.276
Yes?

30:52.442 --> 30:54.194
The Salamancas were hit.

30:54.361 --> 30:56.655
Yesterday, on the way back
from their pickup.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.198
Do we know who?

30:58.365 --> 31:02.369
Not yet. Varga survived, barely.
But he couldn't see faces.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.622
- Someone knows our business.
- Possibly.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.458
It resembled the attack
on Hector's truck months ago.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.627
And they knew
the Salamanca men were heavy.

31:10.794 --> 31:13.755
Don Juan, we are about
to run another shipment.

31:13.922 --> 31:15.716
If you think we're compromised...

31:16.884 --> 31:18.760
Run dummy loads.

31:18.927 --> 31:22.764
We'll see what we see. No product
crosses until we're certain.

31:22.931 --> 31:24.808
I'll take care of it.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.312
How long before our dealers run dry?

31:29.271 --> 31:30.480
No more than a week.

31:33.817 --> 31:35.861
This is a problem.

31:38.113 --> 31:41.408
Find a local supplier on your side
of the border.

31:41.575 --> 31:43.118
Cut a deal.

31:43.285 --> 31:48.081
Don Juan, with all due respect,
Don Eladio forbids buying from outsiders.

31:48.248 --> 31:52.002
- He's been very clear.
- Let me worry about Eladio.

31:52.169 --> 31:54.588
Do it. Now.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.990
And hydrogen and oxygen
And nitrogen and rhenium

32:22.074 --> 32:23.617
And nickel, neodymium
Neptunium, germanium

32:23.700 --> 32:25.994
And iron, americium
Ruthenium, uranium

32:26.078 --> 32:28.080
Europium, zirconium
Lutetium, vanadium

32:28.163 --> 32:30.249
And lanthanum and osmium
And astatine and radium

32:30.332 --> 32:32.501
And gold and protactinium
And indium and gallium

32:33.126 --> 32:35.963
And iodine and thorium
And thulium and thallium

32:36.088 --> 32:38.298
There's yttrium, ytterbium
Actinium, rubidium

32:38.382 --> 32:40.384
And boron, gadolinium, niobium, iridium

32:40.467 --> 32:42.469
There's strontium and silicon
And silver and samarium

32:42.552 --> 32:44.638
And bismuth, bromine, lithium
Beryllium and barium

32:48.558 --> 32:51.520
Mr. Fring. I wasn't expecting you.

32:51.687 --> 32:54.982
- That's not a problem, I hope?
- No, not at all.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.401
I was tinkering with something.

32:57.567 --> 32:59.111
What's that?

32:59.278 --> 33:03.699
Oh, it's technical.
I wouldn't wanna bore you.

33:03.865 --> 33:05.409
Oh, you wouldn't.

33:06.368 --> 33:10.622
Okay. You know when
you put salt into water, it dissolves?

33:10.789 --> 33:14.126
If you stir the water, or heat it,
you can add more salt...

33:14.293 --> 33:16.086
before it falls out of solution.

33:16.253 --> 33:19.381
I'm trying to create a
solution like that...

33:19.548 --> 33:23.176
but with certain benzodiazepine
precursor compounds.

33:23.343 --> 33:26.680
- That's fascinating.
- It will be if I can get it to work.

33:30.559 --> 33:32.811
Oh, I tested your samples.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.454
They range from 39 percent
to 58 percent pure.

33:50.620 --> 33:54.041
Except this one,
which hovers around 67.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.419
Top of the glass, so to speak.

33:57.586 --> 34:01.173
You should tell the chemist
to check his or her cookware.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.926
It's introducing contamination,
which would be easy to avoid.

34:05.093 --> 34:07.012
Well, thank you very much, Gale.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.264
That's very useful information.

34:10.223 --> 34:13.476
Well, I should let you
get back to your work.

34:14.603 --> 34:16.228
Mr. Fring.

34:17.481 --> 34:22.527
I don't want to cast aspersions,
but I have to tell you...

34:22.694 --> 34:25.322
these samples aren't great.

34:25.614 --> 34:27.657
In fact, they're...

34:28.074 --> 34:30.911
They're... They're not even good.

34:31.911 --> 34:35.498
Basically, they're dreck.
I could do much better.

34:35.665 --> 34:37.833
- Gale...
- Much higher-grade.

34:38.001 --> 34:40.962
I could make a kilo or more right here.
No one would know.

34:41.129 --> 34:43.215
Wouldn't take more than a few days.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.967
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your studies.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.096
These are my studies.

34:49.804 --> 34:53.100
Please, it's the least I can do.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.726
I wouldn't let you down.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.397
I'm certain that you wouldn't.

34:58.563 --> 35:02.067
But I'm afraid I can't allow it. Not yet.

35:02.275 --> 35:04.986
You were meant for better things.

35:05.362 --> 35:06.780
I'll see you soon, Gale.

35:07.864 --> 35:09.616
Bye, Mr. Fring.

35:19.376 --> 35:21.378
There's holmium and helium
And hafnium and erbium

35:21.503 --> 35:23.505
And phosphorus and francium
And fluorine and terbium

35:23.588 --> 35:25.590
And manganese and mercury
Molybdenum, magnesium

35:25.674 --> 35:27.676
Dysprosium and scandium
And cerium and cesium

35:27.759 --> 35:29.761
And lead, praseodymium
And platinum, plutonium

35:29.845 --> 35:31.847
Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium

35:31.930 --> 35:34.307
And tantalum, technetium
Titanium, tellurium

35:34.933 --> 35:37.727
And cadmium and calcium
And chromium and curium

35:47.195 --> 35:49.281
I was worried about the wording there.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.700
No. No, it's great.

35:52.409 --> 35:54.161
Really, really solid work.

35:54.411 --> 35:57.456
Just make the change
to indicate the correct term...

35:57.622 --> 36:00.709
for the disbursement of funds,
then we should be good to go.

36:01.251 --> 36:02.461
Don't mind me.

36:02.627 --> 36:05.672
I know it's a law office.

36:05.839 --> 36:08.175
Just walking around your law office.

36:08.925 --> 36:10.260
You slept late.

36:10.427 --> 36:11.761
Yeah.

36:11.928 --> 36:17.142
It took me a while to fall asleep,
actually, but, man, once I did...

36:17.976 --> 36:19.394
You want some coffee, Viola?

36:19.769 --> 36:21.688
Oh, no, thanks. We're just finishing up.

36:21.855 --> 36:24.065
Unless there's something else
you need from me?

36:24.232 --> 36:25.734
No, I think we're good.

36:25.901 --> 36:30.489
Maybe you could also start
looking into federal charter regs.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.324
No rush.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.284
Got it. Will do.

36:34.576 --> 36:35.869
Bye, Jimmy.

36:36.036 --> 36:37.496
See you, Viola.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.080
Bye, thanks.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.656
What's up?

37:13.782 --> 37:17.994
Jimmy, there's just a couple of things
from talking to Howard...

37:19.788 --> 37:21.998
that maybe we ought to go through.

37:22.374 --> 37:23.500
Oh, yeah.

37:23.667 --> 37:25.835
Okay. Let's get it over with.

37:26.002 --> 37:28.755
You know, rip the Band-Aid off, right?

37:28.922 --> 37:30.340
Yeah.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.218
This is a release.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.763
It says, basically,
that you won't contest the will.

37:36.930 --> 37:40.767
- If I sign it, I get my share?
- That's about the size of it.

37:41.434 --> 37:45.230
So how much do I get?

37:46.189 --> 37:48.149
Five thousand.

37:51.152 --> 37:52.821
Five K.

37:55.699 --> 37:58.868
I can pay off my Mastercard.

38:05.292 --> 38:06.585
What else you got?

38:10.005 --> 38:12.048
This is...

38:13.758 --> 38:17.220
It's from Chuck.
Nobody knows for sure what's in it.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.556
You don't have to open it now, but...

38:19.723 --> 38:22.392
Let's see what the old boy has to say.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.603
Okay. I'll give you a minute alone.

38:24.769 --> 38:25.812
No, no, stay.

38:25.979 --> 38:27.522
It's fine.

38:28.648 --> 38:31.693
I mean, you wanna hear this, right?

38:31.860 --> 38:34.779
Yeah. If it's okay.

38:41.077 --> 38:43.121
It's undated.

38:43.413 --> 38:45.081
Okay, here it goes:

38:45.248 --> 38:47.042
"Dear Jimmy...

38:47.292 --> 38:50.670
I have left many things unsaid
in our relationship through the years.

38:50.837 --> 38:54.674
Rather than allow these
unspoken thoughts to die with me...

38:54.841 --> 38:57.010
I've chosen
to record them here for you.

38:57.177 --> 39:02.015
I hope you will take my words
in the spirit in which they are intended."

39:05.018 --> 39:06.019
New paragraph.

39:06.186 --> 39:08.730
"I remember the day
you came home from the hospital.

39:08.897 --> 39:11.024
You can't imagine
the joy on Mom's face.

39:11.191 --> 39:16.029
I can honestly say I never saw her
happier than she was on that day.

39:16.196 --> 39:20.241
You brought a shine to her life nothing
else ever did, and I'm glad of that."

39:20.408 --> 39:22.869
New paragraph.
"We have not always seen eye to eye...

39:23.036 --> 39:24.954
I expect that will continue to be so.

39:25.121 --> 39:29.167
However, nothing will change the fact
that we are brothers, flesh and blood.

39:29.334 --> 39:32.087
Though we are very different,
I want you to know how much I respect...

39:32.253 --> 39:35.090
what you have made of yourself
in these last few years.

39:35.256 --> 39:37.509
You have taken the opportunity
I gave you in the mail room...

39:37.676 --> 39:41.054
and you have run with it, becoming
a valued member of the HHM family.

39:41.221 --> 39:46.267
For all the problems in your past,
I'm proud we share the name 'McGill.'

39:47.477 --> 39:50.814
I sincerely admire
your energy and resilience.

39:50.980 --> 39:54.234
I used to worry about you
finding a place in the world...

39:54.401 --> 39:56.486
but I'm not worried
about that anymore.

39:56.653 --> 39:59.030
I'm certain no matter
what the future may bring...

39:59.197 --> 40:01.408
you'll land on your feet.
I hope when you read this...

40:01.574 --> 40:03.827
you remember me not only
as your brother...

40:03.993 --> 40:08.081
but as a person who was always in your
corner." And he signed it just "Chuck."

40:08.248 --> 40:12.252
Well, say what you want,
the man could write a letter.

40:15.296 --> 40:17.465
- Sorry.
- Hey.

40:17.674 --> 40:21.886
- No, I didn't mean to make it...
- No. It's okay. It's a nice letter.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.431
- Hey.
- No, just...

40:24.973 --> 40:28.935
Just... Just give me...
Just give me a minute.

40:32.355 --> 40:34.023
Kim.
