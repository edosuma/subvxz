00:02.680 --> 00:04.205
Dad's on a hunting trip

00:04.400 --> 00:05.845
<i>and he hasn't been home in a few days.</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:09.609
<i>We could take care
of a few kitchen witches.</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:11.125
They get their power from demons.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.641
<i>I mean, selling your soul
at the crossroads kind of deal.</i>

00:13.800 --> 00:17.600
So you guys were raised by a witch,
but you're hunters?

00:17.760 --> 00:18.761
BOTH: Yep.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.964
MR. KETCH:
<i>Dr. Hess wants to know everything</i>

00:21.160 --> 00:23.686
<i>about our friends the Winchesters.</i>

00:23.840 --> 00:26.241
<i>Their allies. Their habits.</i>

00:26.400 --> 00:29.244
<i>How does Sam get his hair so shiny?</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:33.166
When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly,
I thought the angels could help.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.401
And?

00:37.280 --> 00:39.282
Time to take this off the board.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.646
No!

00:42.440 --> 00:48.243
And I know now that this child
must be born with all of his power.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.005
Hello?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.645
You have to ring the bell.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.964
You startled me.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.521
What a delicate constitution
you must have.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.880
Uh, that is a lovely ring.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.843
Ah, yes.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.683
And if it goes missing,
I'll know who to blame.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.520
I could cleanse your aura if you like.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.206
It looks a little muddy.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.371
Oh. Coming. Sorry.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.646
Hi.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.562
Hi. Sorry for the wait. Are you Tasha?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.882
Tasha Banes, yes. I called and...

02:08.039 --> 02:09.201
Yes. Right, I'm Andy.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.850
We've got you set up
at the top of the stairs.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.047
Fantastic.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.161
So, what brings you to Rock River?
Business or pleasure?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.407
Little bit of both.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.207
Hmm.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.089
Reveal. Now.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.370
Reveal. Now. Reveal.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.041
Ugh.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.686
Oh, God.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.725
DEAN: Okay, so last night.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.527
That Super Mario power-up crap?

04:29.680 --> 04:31.364
That wasn't Cass.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.760
That frigging baby isn't even born yet,
and it sock-puppeted him.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.200
Think about it.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.204
Cass said that he had faith
in Lucifer, Jr.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.368
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.801
I don't know.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.163
I mean, look. This doesn't make
any sense to me either, Dean.

04:53.320 --> 04:58.281
But if we wanna have some shot
at finding Cass, then we have to,

04:58.480 --> 05:01.211
I don't know, uh, try and think like him.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.288
How? Seriously.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.046
I mean, up until now, if Cass messed up,

05:07.240 --> 05:08.401
if he did something wrong,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.370
but he thought it was
for the right reasons, I got it. Right?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.921
But last night? When I looked at him,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.646
I did not recognize
the guy staring back at me.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.606
Can you fix it?

05:35.160 --> 05:36.366
I hope so.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.287
- It's not me.
- Not me.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.480
Must be one of Mom's.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.921
Hello?

05:59.080 --> 06:00.161
ALICIA: <i>Oh, uh...</i>

06:01.560 --> 06:02.846
Sam?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.809
Uh, I didn't know you...

06:04.960 --> 06:06.724
It's Alicia Banes.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.928
Alicia. Hey! What's going on?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.286
Like, Max and Alicia?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.010
Yeah, sorry to, um...

06:12.160 --> 06:14.970
Mary gave me a couple different numbers
to reach her, and we thought...

06:15.120 --> 06:17.088
No. No.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.481
Mmm-mmm.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.280
I thought Mary would be down to help.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.484
- Be our back-up on this, um...
- You sound crazy.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.320
Hey, guys. It's Dean. Are you okay?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.084
It depends who you ask.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.727
Mom was hunting this witch
who's killed people all over Wyoming.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.530
Anyway, Mom usually checks in with us,
but she sort of disappeared.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.401
Oh, my God. She did not disappear.
She's busy.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.006
- Wait. So, your mom is missing?
- Where are you guys?

06:45.160 --> 06:49.210
We're on our way to Rock River, Wyoming.
But Max thinks I'm overreacting, but I...

06:49.360 --> 06:53.206
Because you're being dramatic.
Mom's fine. Stop bothering them.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.331
Fine, okay.
Hey. We'll be okay. Never mind.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.010
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Um...

07:00.800 --> 07:03.041
Hey, why don't you text us your address?
We'll meet you.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.407
- You will?
- They will what?

07:05.560 --> 07:06.607
SAM: <i>We'll see you soon.</i>

07:08.040 --> 07:09.929
What the hell, man? What about Cass?

07:10.080 --> 07:11.650
Dude, Cass ditched his cell phone.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.009
Jody put an APB out for Cass and Kelly
across three states.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.046
Until that shakes something loose
or we get some other break,

07:19.200 --> 07:22.647
all we're doing is sitting here,
banging our heads against a brick wall.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.211
Let's get out there, let's...

07:27.040 --> 07:29.611
Their mom's on a hunting trip,
and hasn't been home in a week.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.201
All right. Let's go.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.604
Please be a dear
and shut that bloody thing off.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.722
- It's Dean.
- And?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.764
MARY ON PHONE:
<i>This is Mary. Leave a message.</i>

08:19.920 --> 08:21.251
Mom.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.291
Hey, I just wanted to let you know
that me and Sam, we're...

08:25.480 --> 08:30.441
We're heading out on a case with those
witch twins, Max and Alicia. Um...

08:30.600 --> 08:36.562
I'll text you the info, but I know
the Brits have got you running non-stop,

08:36.720 --> 08:39.644
so, if you can help out, that'd be great.
Um...

08:41.919 --> 08:45.527
And even if you can't swing by,
can you call me back?

08:46.520 --> 08:50.969
Just some stuff going down,
it's kinda got me spun out.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.684
It'd be good to talk to you.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.963
I suppose it amuses you
to take Mary's form,

09:06.120 --> 09:11.445
or perhaps you believe it will inspire
a bit of hesitation on my part.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.601
It will not.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.681
He's not gonna talk.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.488
The shifter has killed people, Mary.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.286
This is the very beginning
of what it deserves.

09:42.440 --> 09:47.446
And if it tells us where its family is,
well, then, this will all stop.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.727
Promise.

09:55.320 --> 09:59.006
That eye of yours twitches when you lie.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.090
My eye twitches all the time.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.007
<i>Well then.</i>

10:10.640 --> 10:13.120
I guess I know all about you.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.361
SAM: <i>Hey, guys-</i>

10:23.160 --> 10:24.207
Hey.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.170
All right, well, we're here.
What do you got?

10:27.320 --> 10:29.084
Our mom was after a borrower witch.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.288
So, a witch that gets their power
from a demon deal?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.481
Mmm-hmm.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.005
Okay, so you tracked your mom here?

10:34.160 --> 10:36.970
No, we tracked her
to the only vegan restaurant in town.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.690
They told us where she was staying.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.365
Anything else?

10:41.520 --> 10:43.045
I got the bartender's phone number.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.244
Ignore him.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.602
Dean. That car is still major.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.327
You want the tour?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.606
- Definitely.
- Come on.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.083
Yeah. Max isn't really feeling this.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.083
Yeah. Hadn't noticed.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.242
He always thinks he knows Mom better.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.085
But it's because they're both
natural witches. It's who they are.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.721
Whoa.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.287
- Right? Yeah.
- Nice.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.408
- Is that a grenade launcher?
- Yes, she is.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.328
Yeah, but this is what we need right now.
Witch-killer bullets.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.609
What about you? With magic.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.250
No, I don't have it.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.323
It's just kind of a lot of noise to me.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.604
Magic is definitely their thing, you know?

11:37.520 --> 11:38.885
Yeah.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.964
When I was growing up, Dean and my dad
had the same thing with hunting.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.565
<i>That bond.</i>

11:43.760 --> 11:45.091
What about with Mary?

11:46.800 --> 11:51.886
I mean, she gets into a case
and just, sort of, vanishes.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.771
Yeah. No, Mary's a great hunter.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.126
Yeah.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.170
She doesn't seem like much of a hugger.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.967
Yeah.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.367
DEAN: <i>Hey.</i>

12:08.080 --> 12:09.161
Let's go find your mom.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.570
Well, her car is here.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.290
No one's trying to hide it.
That's good news.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.487
Yeah.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.687
Not weird at all.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.404
All right, if anything happens,
you guys stay behind us.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.528
Yeah. Sure.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.011
Alicia.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.807
Uh, hi!

12:47.960 --> 12:49.200
Hey-

12:49.360 --> 12:50.521
Can I help you?

12:50.680 --> 12:52.921
Yes, please. We're looking for...

12:53.120 --> 12:56.966
Max? Alicia? What are you two doing here?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.361
Mom.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.485
Sam and Dean Winchester,
meet the great Tasha Banes.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.165
The kids have told me very nice things.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.006
Alicia basically made them come.
Just in case you were in peril.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.609
Well, that was unnecessary,
but very nice of you, all the same.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.480
<i>Andy, can we get a couple of rooms
for my children and their friends?</i>

13:28.640 --> 13:30.563
Sure. It'll just be a minute.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.690
Great. You can wait in my room.
I have wine.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.167
Great.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.487
Wine.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.850
So, Rock River's a dead end.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.844
No witches here, unfortunately.
Thought this was the place...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.606
Well, then, why didn't you call us?
I mean, we called...

13:49.440 --> 13:51.363
I called and texted a lot.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.681
I'm sorry, baby.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.684
My phone hasn't been charging all day.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.128
Oh, but I did find
a fantastic acupuncturist.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.691
BOTH: Of course, you did.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.690
- You want me to help with that?
- Oh, I've got it.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.923
No, but you always call on the fourth day
of a hunt. No matter what.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.765
Honestly, baby, it just slipped my...

14:10.800 --> 14:12.962
Mom? You okay?

14:14.680 --> 14:18.002
- I'm fine. Sam, do the honors.
- Of course.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.321
Alicia, put some music on.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.291
Oh, I ordered food
from that vegan place, but no deliveries.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.369
- Oh, I can get it.
- Oh, I'll grab it.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.167
You guys stay. Hang out.
Catch up. Dean, drink.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.600
Yes.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.726
I must say, I am pumping with adrenaline.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.645
Perhaps we could find some privacy
and tire ourselves out?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.245
It's not illicit motel sex, but...

15:02.400 --> 15:05.244
I remember us agreeing
that was a one-time thing.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.210
Did We? Ah, Well...

15:08.360 --> 15:10.488
Ketch, it was a waste of time,
that little torture session.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.160
You mean
the information-gathering session?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.846
Yeah, but we didn't get any intel.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.924
That shifter was never going to
betray his family. And still, you...

15:19.120 --> 15:21.771
Sometimes pain works,
sometimes it doesn't.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.726
But anyone who tells you
that torture is never the answer?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.211
They haven't been under the knife.

15:27.560 --> 15:32.168
But you enjoyed it. Because that,
I have never seen that side of you.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.081
Yes, well, Mary, I'm sad to say
that you won't become the Jiminy Cricket

15:36.440 --> 15:38.681
of the British Men of Letters.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.081
We don't need a conscience.

15:42.640 --> 15:47.680
Such a trite idea, but we firmly believe
the ends do justify the means.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.211
They didn't this time.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.362
Ah, but look, you're still with us.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.284
Feel free to call Mick Davies.
Have him write me up.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.644
No, Mick's not answering his phone.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.529
And his e-mails have stopped.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.250
I'm sure he's busy.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.568
When you get called to London
by the old men,

16:08.720 --> 16:12.042
it's not all pints of stout
and trips to Savile Row.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.084
Oh, and you should probably return
Dean's call.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.405
Wouldn't want him to think
Mummy doesn't love him.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.810
- Expecting a call?
- No. Guess not.

16:37.960 --> 16:43.046
Let's say, later, I, hypothetically, might
need yourjeep to take it out for maybe...

16:43.200 --> 16:44.281
Let's not.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.482
You know, I gotta say,
you did a bang-up job with those two.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.689
You must be drunk.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.171
Off of wine?

16:53.440 --> 16:56.330
I did the best I could for Max and Alicia.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.403
- No.
- I got lucky.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.440
I see how you are with them.
All right? It's good. They're happy.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.685
Alicia said you grew up in the life.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.601
Yeah. Yeah.
My dad raised me and Sam to hunt.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.839
And your mother?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.729
That's complicated.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.450
Yeah, family's always complicated.

17:24.680 --> 17:29.641
Parents always seem smart
and strong and perfect.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.486
It's only when you grow up
that you realize that they're just people.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.206
DEAN: <i>And even if you can't swing by,
can you call me back?</i>

17:51.160 --> 17:55.484
<i>Just some stuff going down,
it's kinda got me spun out.</i>

17:59.640 --> 18:01.165
<i>It'd be good to talk to you.</i>

18:06.600 --> 18:10.002
Well, I can't just send him
to economy comfort now, can I?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.530
The package is in the armory now.
We gave it a lot number.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.126
1-2-2-5-7.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.681
Hmm.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.927
We'll speak when you get in. Turrah.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.121
Hey.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.565
You've made yourself at home.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.641
Uh...

18:43.360 --> 18:45.169
Can I help you with something?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.364
I use Mick's computer for e-mail.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.685
Yeah, Well, have at it.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.324
There's a message from Mick.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.731
He says he's gonna be stuck in London
a few more weeks.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.841
Hmm.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.242
Well. There you are.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.649
- Hey!
- Oh, food!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.040
- Who's hungry?
- ALICIA: Me.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.964
- TASHA: Oh, my goodness. Thank you.
- All right.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.121
TASHA: <i>Ooh, it smells so good.</i>

19:41.360 --> 19:42.407
ALICIA: <i>All right,
let's see what we've got.</i>

19:42.560 --> 19:44.324
- Here, I can set it up over here.
- MAX: Hey.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.130
- We'll be right back, y'all.
- Sure.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.361
- Yeah.
- MAX: Just give it to me.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.126
TASHA: <i>Oh, you two, get it down.
Grab some napkins.</i>

19:50.280 --> 19:51.964
I know that look. What's up?

19:52.560 --> 19:53.766
This was posted outside the restaurant.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.722
That guy we saw earlier,
coming out of the cellar?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.604
He's been missing for a month.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.450
Okay, that's weird.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.080
Well, maybe Tasha's wrong.
Maybe there is something going on here.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.526
Yeah. I'll let them know.

20:05.720 --> 20:09.088
No, no, no. Let's...
We can handle it. Come on.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.521
Hmm.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.368
DEAN: <i>This is Dean's other, other cell,
so you must know what to do.</i>

21:01.840 --> 21:03.410
Hey, it's me.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.810
Sorry I couldn't pick up before.
I've been on a hunt with Ketch.

21:09.720 --> 21:14.681
And Dean, I'm sorry I haven't been there
for you and Sam.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.843
But I wanna be. I will be.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.451
I just... I need to finish this.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.409
I miss you boys. I love you.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.848
- to make a phone call, in the rain.
- TASHA: <i>She did not.</i>

21:39.000 --> 21:41.207
- He just got out to yell at me.
- TASHA: Oh, my God. That is so sad.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.806
Ugh.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.407
- It smells like death.
- Yeah.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.402
- Go ahead.
- What? You.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.607
All right.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.524
Was it that serious?

22:13.800 --> 22:17.930
Ladies, I'm gonna leave you alone now
to have some girl time.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.764
Since when are you
not a part of girl time?

22:19.920 --> 22:25.484
Since I've got a date with that
hot bartender from that vegan restaurant.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.529
We're gonna have some guy time.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.331
Hey, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.289
Right. Right.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.047
And what exactly was that? Right.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.400
Max!

22:50.280 --> 22:51.361
DEAN: <i>Sam.</i>

22:56.640 --> 22:57.641
Ugh.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.246
Dean.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.444
Son of a bitch.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.685
- Her heart's been ripped out.
- So have theirs.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.963
Wait, this is everybody
that's in the house.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.765
Okay, well, if this is the real Tasha,

23:28.920 --> 23:30.570
then who the hell
was I talking to up there?

23:37.680 --> 23:38.761
MAX: Hey.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.766
- Hey, Max.
- Saw the light.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.969
- You guys find some trouble to get into?
- No. No, no, no. We just, uh...

23:53.840 --> 23:54.921
I just...

25:05.680 --> 25:06.681
Oh.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.081
Mick.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.805
Come on, come on, come on.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.161
What the...

26:17.240 --> 26:20.562
DEAN ON SPEAKER: <i>So, now we're reporting
to low-rent Christian Bale?</i>

26:20.760 --> 26:24.048
<i>Seriously? I don't like that guy.
He creeps me out.</i>

26:25.400 --> 26:29.121
<i>This is Dean's other, other cell,
so you must know what to do.</i>

26:29.280 --> 26:33.649
Dean, call me. We've got a problem.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.010
Hello, Mary.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.088
Your handprint doesn't open this room
because it's not for you.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.526
What are you doing here?

26:48.760 --> 26:50.967
Why is Mick's body in a box?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.881
An unfortunate werewolf mishap.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.611
A werewolf shot him in the head?

27:00.120 --> 27:01.201
It's not impossible.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.282
- You're a psychopath.
- Mary...

27:09.720 --> 27:10.801
Did you kill him?

27:12.480 --> 27:14.767
Mick was weak. He wasn't one of us...

27:22.880 --> 27:25.326
When will you realize
that we will do whatever it takes

27:25.480 --> 27:29.007
to rid this world of the things
that go bump in the night?

27:31.240 --> 27:36.565
Something that people like Mick,
and your sons, are incapable of.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.720
- Don't talk about my boys.
- Why not?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.807
I've been cleaning up after them
for months.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.561
I took care of those federal agents
they stupidly allowed to live.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.486
I killed a psychic girl
they thought was human.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.686
Honestly, they're damn sloppy.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.841
I think you mean "decent."

28:20.360 --> 28:25.082
It's the end for the American hunters.
Their time has passed.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.765
But I can keep you safe.

28:28.800 --> 28:34.170
If you just play your part,
if you play nice.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.121
I don't play nice.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.481
Are we done?

28:52.800 --> 28:56.566
Those Enochian brass knuckles
only work on angels.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.404
And sadly, I'm not an...

29:01.000 --> 29:03.480
Brass knuckles are brass knuckles.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.843
Go, you bitch!

29:22.160 --> 29:23.764
- No, I think he's really...
- MAX: Who are you?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.007
Max?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.444
- What did you do to my mom?
- Max! What are you...

29:27.600 --> 29:28.931
- Wait, wait, wait, Alicia...
- Tell me!

29:29.160 --> 29:30.241
- What are you doing?
- ALICIA: Let her go!

29:30.400 --> 29:32.084
- That's not your mom. Shh.
- What?

29:32.280 --> 29:34.362
- What are you talking... Mom!
- Wait, wait, wait. It's okay.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.682
Max. What is wrong, sweetie? Are you...

29:36.840 --> 29:39.081
Don't, don't. You are not my mom.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.529
I don't know what kind of thing you are,
but you are not my mom.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.011
Max! Stop!

29:45.160 --> 29:49.210
Reveal. Now! Reveal.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.450
The room... End of the hall...
Top of the stairs.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.641
Magic.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.087
Max!

30:27.240 --> 30:28.321
Mom!

30:30.360 --> 30:34.285
Really? People are trying to sleep.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.249
All right, lady. Craft time's over.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.083
Mom. Mom!

30:45.520 --> 30:47.727
Sam, this magic, what is this?

30:47.880 --> 30:48.927
I don't know. I don't know.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.847
Oh. How lucky am I?

30:57.360 --> 31:00.250
Such an impressive witch.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.370
Maybe you'll take the deal
the last bitch wouldn't.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.811
My mother, you killed her.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.205
Did I?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.402
What did you do to those people?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.601
Oh.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.645
Let me show you.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.170
I'm reaching the end of my very long life,

31:40.320 --> 31:43.881
<i>and it's a problem
'cause I sold my soul for power,</i>

31:44.040 --> 31:47.044
so when I pass, my soul goes to hell,

31:47.200 --> 31:51.171
unless I can find someone
to take the burden.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.448
To take my magic.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.647
Sam! Mom. Mom.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.531
When your mother found me,

32:00.680 --> 32:03.206
and when I realized what she was,

32:03.400 --> 32:04.765
I offered to teach her.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.170
<i>I offered her my power.</i>

32:13.520 --> 32:16.171
<i>But even dying, she was rude.</i>

32:21.800 --> 32:25.930
So, I made her into one of my creatures.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.769
That doll has
all of your mother's memories.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.691
It's her. Mostly.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.322
Just like the others. Rick, Andy.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.767
They do what I want. When I want.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.043
I'm old. I like things a certain way.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.567
No. No!

33:24.400 --> 33:26.084
Nice try.

33:26.240 --> 33:31.371
If you kill me,
well, then, all of them just fall apart.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.080
So, here's the offer.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.291
You take my power.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.362
You take my burden and my doll,

33:40.520 --> 33:44.969
your mother will stay
with you and your sister forever.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.282
Just one big, happy family.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.602
Max, no. Listen to me.
Your mother is gone, okay?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.131
<i>It's awful and it sucks, but that...</i>

33:59.520 --> 34:02.763
So? Do we have a deal?

34:19.800 --> 34:20.880
You okay?

34:22.280 --> 34:23.327
Mom.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.481
No!

34:34.920 --> 34:40.484
Take it and the deal is done.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.485
<i>Take it.</i>

35:23.640 --> 35:26.644
Hey. Just take it easy.
We're gonna get you some help.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.926
Why did you...

35:28.080 --> 35:32.961
Max. Listen to me. Hey. I had to, okay?

35:33.120 --> 35:36.044
That deal wasn't with her,
it was with a demon.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.726
You even touch that magic,
you lose your soul.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.927
SAM: <i>Dean!</i>

35:42.680 --> 35:43.841
Come on.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.729
Don't fight. Don't worry.
Just take it easy, okay? Take a breath.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.161
Alicia.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.321
She, uh...

36:06.600 --> 36:07.726
Alicia?

36:10.680 --> 36:11.886
<i>What?</i>

36:12.040 --> 36:14.771
Please, no.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.606
Hey. Hey. Hey.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.006
Please, no. No, no, no, no!

36:37.200 --> 36:40.249
Okay, Max. This is, uh...

36:42.240 --> 36:46.006
Look, you're probably in shock right now,
but it's gonna pass.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.650
And then it's gonna hurt.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.762
I could have saved them. My mom.

36:56.040 --> 37:00.284
If I had just taken Alicia seriously.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.851
Hey, come on now.
You can't think like that...

37:02.000 --> 37:06.324
Just stop talking. Please.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.286
Sure.

37:12.840 --> 37:17.528
- We'll go get some supplies. We have to...
- We gotta burn the bodies, Max.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.571
Like my dad.

37:25.920 --> 37:30.642
I can do it. I should do it.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.646
You two get out of here.

37:34.640 --> 37:35.721
Max, we would...

37:35.880 --> 37:39.965
Please. Please, just...

37:57.760 --> 38:00.843
You did the right thing. You saved him.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.770
Yeah. Yeah, he seems super saved.

38:08.280 --> 38:12.046
You know, I was watching them.
This loving family.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.804
The kind we should have had.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.362
And now, just like that, it's gone.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.610
SAM: <i>Dean, you couldn't let Max
make some deal for his soul.</i>

38:25.320 --> 38:29.041
DEAN: <i>Sam, we do terrible things
all the time to save each other.</i>

38:29.240 --> 38:32.642
<i>I mean, that's what you do for family.
Who am I to stop him?</i>

38:35.000 --> 38:37.480
SAM: <i>Well, he's strong.
He'll be all right.</i>

38:40.520 --> 38:42.045
DEAN: <i>Yeah, I'm not so sure.</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:57.608
What happened?
I feel like I drank too much tequila.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.446
What? What did you do? Are you hurt?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.729
No, no, no, no.
I'll explain everything,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.201
but we've got to go now, okay?

39:11.360 --> 39:12.441
Okay.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.970
MARY: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

39:58.160 --> 40:01.369
<i>Sorry I couldn't pick up before.
I've been on a hunt with Ketch.</i>

40:01.520 --> 40:04.603
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been there
for you and Sam.</i>

40:04.760 --> 40:07.331
<i>But I wanna be. I will be.</i>

40:07.480 --> 40:10.563
<i>I just... I need to finish this.</i>

40:10.760 --> 40:13.889
<i>I miss you boys. I love you.</i>

40:19.160 --> 40:22.369
<i>Dean, call me. We've got a problem.</i>

40:26.440 --> 40:29.603
Sam. Hey. It's Mom. Something's wrong.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.001
Sam!

40:42.960 --> 40:44.689
Good of you to rejoin me.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.006
A Taser?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.564
Not really a fair fight.

40:53.360 --> 40:59.083
If only you'd been as ruthless as I hoped,
this could have worked out.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.965
Remember, Mary, I gave you a chance.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.565
So now what?

41:12.400 --> 41:13.561
You kill me?

41:26.120 --> 41:28.964
WOMAN: Don't be silly. You're an asset.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.003
<i>We've other plans for you.</i>

41:35.200 --> 41:36.440
Now, Mary...

41:41.600 --> 41:42.806
Let's begin.
