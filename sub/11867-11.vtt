WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.329
CARTER: Previously, on Eureka.

00:03.378 --> 00:05.118
It's your anniversary.
One year in Eureka.

00:05.214 --> 00:06.203
Thanks, Callie.

00:06.298 --> 00:09.540
I can't remember
the last time that
I had a good date.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.003
I'm waiting
for somebody.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.042
Who's the lucky lady?

00:13.764 --> 00:17.256
Henry, you said something
the other day when
you weren't yourself.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.386
Something about Kim.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.717
Huh.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.101
And what Beverly did to her.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.519
I wasn't myself.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.599
ALLISON: Kevin?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.851
He controls
the field now, Allie.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.902
He '3 evolving.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.688
And, Henry, you said
you had proof

00:29.738 --> 00:32.070
that someone sabotaged the
experiment that killed Kim?

00:32.324 --> 00:35.862
No, I said that I'd found
something that proved
you weren't responsible.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.072
It's hot today, huh?

00:42.543 --> 00:43.953
Mmm-hmm.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.784
Looking pretty hot
in that uniform.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.457
Very hot.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.422
Excuse me?

00:50.509 --> 00:53.672
Oh, l'mjust saying,
you know, if you want
to get comfortable, you could

00:53.762 --> 00:55.127
take something off.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.758
It's fine.
We're alone.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.805
All alone.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.770
Come on, Jo!

01:09.820 --> 01:11.230
(LAUGHING)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
"All alone."

01:11.280 --> 01:12.440
No. Oh,
forget it.
Forget it.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.611
This is ridiculous.

01:14.116 --> 01:17.108
Sexual harassment
is anything but
ridiculous, Sheriff.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.487
Gender dynamics
are something

01:18.579 --> 01:20.365
every organization
has to contend with.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.286
Now I appreciate
your kind attention.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.163
Let's thank
our role players,
shall we?

01:24.251 --> 01:27.459
Especially Sheriff Carter
for offering such
a despicable example.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.619
No problem.
Thank you very much.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.708
Now, if you'll
excuse us, we have
to head back to work.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.048
Thank you, Dr. Young,
for a very informative
presentation.

01:37.139 --> 01:40.427
Well, if I can spare at least
one person the humiliation
of sexual harassment,

01:40.475 --> 01:42.215
then I've
done my job.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.517
I think I'm with
Sheriff Grab Ass.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.936
This seems to be
a ridiculous
waste of time.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.518
Nathan, as long as
Global is funding
your research,

01:48.609 --> 01:51.271
you have to follow
the same rules
as everyone else.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.151
And that attitude
is precisely

01:53.238 --> 01:55.900
why this training
is so necessary,
Dr. Stark.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.027
You people think
a high IQ means
you can just forget

01:58.118 --> 02:00.734
3.7 billion years
of evolution,
but you're wrong.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.035
We are apes.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.828
Male apes are driven
to reproduce themselves

02:03.915 --> 02:05.041
with as many partners
as possible,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.286
and female apes
will use any
means necessary

02:07.336 --> 02:08.917
to possess the male
as her protector.

02:09.004 --> 02:11.916
These are
unequivocal
biological truths.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.464
I believe that
the people of Eureka

02:14.509 --> 02:15.965
are a little more
evolved than that,

02:16.011 --> 02:18.343
which is why we've never had
a sexual harassment case

02:18.430 --> 02:19.966
in the history of the town.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.097
Well, we've been
very fortunate.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.345
You've been lulled
into complacency.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.430
There are huge pressures
under the surface
of this community

02:26.521 --> 02:28.022
and one day
they'll erupt.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.522
And woe be unto you
when that happens.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.856
Woe be unto me?

02:34.905 --> 02:36.111
(GIGGLES)

02:36.198 --> 02:38.439
Well, we have to admire
her commitment.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.946
Yeah, and speaking of which,
I'm going to get back
to our little project.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.528
It's going quite well.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.242
lllcheckin
with you later.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.322
All right.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.791
Hey, got a minute?

02:53.882 --> 02:54.917
Sure.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.794
You look hot
in that uniform.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.627
Thanks. I am hot,
actually. What's up
with the AC?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.507
It's not working.
Yeah.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.421
Actually, you know what?
I could use you.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.348
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a piece of meat.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.227
I got feelings,
emotions. Needs.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.725
Yeah. Our biology
systems engineer,
Dr. Stone,

03:10.816 --> 03:12.772
has not been
answering my pages,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.269
and I'm getting
worried about him.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.226
He designed Eureka's
air conditioning system,

03:16.321 --> 03:17.606
and he does
all the repairs.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.690
What's a biologist have
to do with the AC?

03:21.076 --> 03:23.408
Well, the rest of the world
has room conditioning,

03:23.495 --> 03:25.110
Eureka has
air conditioning.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.322
The cooling unit's
part of an integrated
underground system.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.659
Now water, gas, waste,
it's all recycled.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.495
It's a biological model
based on the human
digestive system.

03:34.589 --> 03:39.458
So it's a billion degrees
out there because
the town has blockage?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.795
Kind of. Dr. Stone's
been overhauling older
parts of the system,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.596
but he's behind
on upgrading
the new schematics.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.803
Henry's down
in the tunnels now
trying to figure it out.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.145
Oh, Heniy'll fix it.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.595
Well, it's not that easy.
The systems work
in equilibrium.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.930
With the cooling
systems down,

03:52.983 --> 03:54.473
we have water leakage,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.149
methane buildup
in the sewers.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.772
All right,
I'll find Dr. Stone.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.148
Um... There's something else
I need to talk to you about.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.371
I need the files
from the explosion
that killed Kim Anderson.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.493
VVhy?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.290
To find out
what happened.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.585
I don't think
that Henry's been
completely honest with me.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.416
Well, we know
what happened.
It was an accident.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.673
It looked like
an accident, yeah,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.796
but it's been implied that

04:23.263 --> 04:25.003
Beverly's involved.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.599
I just want to be sure.
I know you do, too.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.306
Well, the files
are classified.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.311
But I'll get you
what I can.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.392
Thanks.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.894
Oh, and Carter, if you
ever find anything,

04:36.985 --> 04:37.974
will you let me
know, please?

04:38.069 --> 04:40.981
Of course.
Yeah. Thanks.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.327
Stone.
Don't believe
I know him.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, he keeps
the place cool?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.502
You know, keeps
the toilets running.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.329
(WOLF PANTING)
Works in the tunnels.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.335
Oh, him.
Yeah.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.253
The Mole.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.339
Strange fella.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.175
Yeah. When was
the last time
you saw him?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.637
Tuesday. The AC was
a bit hinkey.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.346
Put in some priority
cooling ducts

05:12.437 --> 05:14.177
for Fred and Wilma
to keep them comfy.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.184
Oh. Beautiful dogs.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.357
Just...
Aren't you, huh?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.063
Hi, buddy.
Yes, you are.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.894
They're not dogs.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.241
Canis lupus albus.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.987
Hybrid Siberian
tundra wolves.

05:28.036 --> 05:32.029
Oh. Yeah,
nice tundra wolves.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.035
What was the shot for?

05:35.126 --> 05:36.741
Hormone cocktail.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.125
Trying to encourage
a little lupine /'amour.

05:41.174 --> 05:45.964
Gave Fred every combination
of cloned linoleic pheromone
in the book.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.294
Nary a nuzzle.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.222
Ah, if all else fails,
there is Barry White.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.428
Would you like
some sugar, Sheriff?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.430
No. No, I'm good, thanks.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.058
But has your husband
disappeared before?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.688
lnto his work.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.769
Some men play golf.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.227
Some collect egg cups.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.232
My man loves
his tunnels.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.022
Egg cups.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.408
And you think that he's
down there somewhere?

06:10.495 --> 06:11.826
Oh, I'm sure of it.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.620
He probably just
lost track of the time.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.165
He can be down there
for days on end sometimes

06:17.252 --> 06:19.868
and I don't hear
a peep out of him.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.004
Has to be tough
on a marriage.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.924
Bob says,

06:26.970 --> 06:30.804
"Marriage is like
a palladium-lined
geothermal heating system.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.053
"Beautiful and complicated.

06:35.270 --> 06:39.855
"And you just never know
when the pressure's gonna
rip the whole thing apart."

06:39.941 --> 06:41.852
Bob sounds
very romantic.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.398
Callie called.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.612
Thanks.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.861
Oh, hey,
you got what...
I left...

06:54.956 --> 06:55.945
From Zane.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.159
Yeah.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.871
You gonna call her?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.668
Yeah. Yeah.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.289
You call Zane?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.759
No, not yet.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.677
It's hard
to dive back in.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.966
Tell me about it.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.971
I feel like such a guy.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.060
Me too.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.141
Hey.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.312
Hey.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.348
Hey.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.807
l was just
down the street,

07:24.861 --> 07:26.647
so I thought
I'd bring you this.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.778
Thanks.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.032
I'm gonna go
freshen up.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.988
You two kids
excuse me.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.506
So, good day?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.123
Average strange.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.677
So, what are you
up to this weekend?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.388
Climb into my freezer.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.686
Try to get away
from the heat.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.764
Well, l was thinking,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.855
my uncle has
this great cabin
on the Payette River.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.902
Oh.
Cool breezes.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.606
Warm fire.

08:13.868 --> 08:14.948
What do you think?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.823
(TOILET WATER BUBBLING)

08:19.082 --> 08:21.698
Cabin, breeze and fire.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.208
(RUMBLING)
Sounds like...

08:24.295 --> 08:25.796
JO: She's gonna blow!

08:26.006 --> 08:27.291
(CALLIE GROANS)

08:34.347 --> 08:35.962
What did you eat?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.248
HENRY: Methane backed up
in the waste matrix

09:11.301 --> 09:13.587
must have found
an ignition source.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.924
CARTER: Well, I think
Jo was laser-plucking
her eyebrows.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.095
(LAUGHING)
That'll do it.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.301
Yeah.
What's the smell?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.632
Which one,
the sulfur dust

09:20.727 --> 09:23.264
or the phosphorus
that's coming off
of the sewage biofilm?

09:23.313 --> 09:26.726
This is no place
for anybody with
a respiratory disease.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.812
Yeah.
Welcome to
the bowels of Eureka.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.188
You guys should
give out hats.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.689
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:32.781 --> 09:35.864
Hey, do I need
to give out
a toilet alert?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.569
No, not yet.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.530
I've got
a couple of teams
from hydrogeology

09:39.621 --> 09:41.361
cutting vent holes
in the surface.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.118
That'll relieve
the gas and buy
us some time.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.200
Okay. How long
do you think
it'll take to fix?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.283
(CHUCKLES)

09:47.378 --> 09:50.040
Not a clue. I mean,
we're missing
tons of data.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.206
Oh, good, look.
It's done.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.799
All right, so these are
the water treatment pools.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.177
This is the main vibrator
to create an inertial wave,

09:58.264 --> 10:00.641
so that the water
flows up instead of down.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.102
And that is
where we are.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.304
Well, keep
your eyes open.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.102
Stone's wife said that
he was probably still
down here somewhere.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.479
I'll do the best I can.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.358
Just tell Jo to lay off
the laser in the lavatory
for a while,

10:11.444 --> 10:15.028
because it's probably
gonna get worse
before it gets better.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.321
All right.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.445
Left, then right,
then left.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.905
VINCENT:
Anything else you want,

10:24.999 --> 10:26.330
you let me know
and I'll make it for you.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.918
Sure.
Hey, Zane.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.162
Ihavent
done anything.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.414
Now, well,
the day is young.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.372
Vince, could I get
a burger, please? Rare.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.003
Oh, I have a great
special today.

10:36.094 --> 10:41.179

Lamb patty, garlic,
papnka.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.180
I'm talking
a little hunk
of Balkan heaven.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.133
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
You should try it.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.346
That sounds great.
All right.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.977
Yeah, I'll have
the burger, please.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.683
Rare.
With some ketchup.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.396
Carter.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.031
I freaked you out,
didn't I?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.160
A little, yeah.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.365
But, I mean,
you got to admit,

11:05.456 --> 11:08.539
having Jo explode a toilet
was a pretty good diversion.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.869
Look, this whole
dating thing...

11:12.964 --> 11:15.125
Uncharted waters.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.205
Yeah.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.170
VINCENT: Judy, your
order's almost ready.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.801
Listen, I think
the important thing
is that we just

11:21.222 --> 11:22.382
keep talking.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.388
An open exchange
of information.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.590
That sounds great.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.391
Sheriff, hello.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.729
This is a pleasure.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.848
So, when are you
coming back out
to the house?

11:32.901 --> 11:34.562
Callie,
I got to go.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.234
(STAMMERING)
Could we exchange
some information later?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.946
Oh, sure.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.737
All right.
I'll call you. Bye.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.947
Sorry. Does this
have something to do
with your husband?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.904
Oh, poo.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.619
We talked about
Bob all morning.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.291
I want to talk
aboutyou.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.663
I want to know
what is going on
in here.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.957
Here you go.
And ljust want
to say thank you.

I do worthwhile.

Adventurous.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.632

getting to people.

Dr. Stone?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.651
Yeah. A weird guy
but a loyal customer.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.487
Oh.
Oh, I hate this heat.

for a while.

Get everybody
out of there now!

Hey, Henry.
I'm at lunch.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.532
I know where
you are!

an inertia thing coming.

you still with me?

listen. I...

14:30.536 --> 14:33.573
Forget it. It was
an in-the-moment thing.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.369
Good, okay.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.415
Are we still
in the moment?

Because I'd really like
to do it again.

to lie you down.

this way about Carter

No. I don't know.

I guess so.

It could have been
the acoustic reed valve,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.885
or the magnetic diaphragm
might have failed.

poking around
down there.

blew Cafe Diem apart.

who can solve it now!

Yeah, and I still don't know
what's happened to Stone.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.693
Yeah, well,
when the valve kicked,
I saw his lunchbox,

16:32.742 --> 16:34.528
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
so he could still be
down there somewhere.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.158
Okay. Hold on.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.319
Hey. Carter.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.862
First off,
I was totally
insane before.

16:39.916 --> 16:44.501
For the record,
I do not now nor have I
ever wanted to jump you.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.706
You believe me, right?
Well, I don't know.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.839
I mean, maybe you just
got tired of staring
at Lake Carter

16:49.884 --> 16:51.499
and had to take a dip.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.792
Okay, you're
making me nauseous.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.047
Oh, that’s probably
from hitting your head.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.423
You might want to get
that checked out.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.131
Later. We've got
bigger problems
to deal with first.

in our backyard.

bladder control.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.728
It's shooting out
on Main Street.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.981
It's probably
the pressure from
the ion-purification pools.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.184
You see, you plug up
one hole, and then bam!

17:09.237 --> 17:10.693
Another one bursts
someplace else.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.727
Wow. Can we stop it?

17:11.822 --> 17:12.902
Yeah.
I don't know. Maybe.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.780
But, you know,
the sewer system's
gonna get backed up.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.073
Awesome.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.074
G.D. has
nine departments
working on this.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.325
Geomorphology is tracking
the pressure pockets
in the bedrock.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.576
Cartography is trying
to extrapolate maps

17:23.668 --> 17:25.750
from Stone's
incomplete data.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.747
It is nuts!

17:29.674 --> 17:31.164
Where did you say
you saw his lunchbox?

17:31.717 --> 17:32.832
I have to get
back upstairs.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.509
We have super-pressurized
water venting
onto Main Street.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.461
Just tell me
what he said.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.888
He wants to look
into what happened.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.015
He's not gonna
let this go.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.341
Carter is
following a road

17:42.436 --> 17:45.428
that goes right through Henry
and leads right to Kevin.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.605
Well, maybe we have
to trust Carter,

17:47.650 --> 17:49.265
bring him
into the loop now.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.770
This isn't about
trusting Carter, Allie.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.776
This is
about the DOD.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.939
Look, I know
you work for them,

17:56.033 --> 17:58.365
but you don't know them
the way that I do.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.285
If they get a hold
of Kevin, he will never
have a normal life.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.911
They will quarantine him
and study him

18:02.957 --> 18:04.743
until they have
the answers they want.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.615
And I'm not letting
that happen to him.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.955
Well, we have
to get that thing
out of him.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.290
We will.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.295
But I need access.
Kim's lab, the data.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.750

about the artifact.

Everything I had when
l was the head of G.D.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.596
The D.O.D. will never
give you that clearance.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.142
Who's asking?

18:24.312 --> 18:26.553
Left, left, right.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.854
You've got
to be kidding.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.273
Oh, great.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.870

so you're still here.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.969
Hi. What?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.383
What you doing?

19:05.478 --> 19:06.934
Long, weird story.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.678
Okay.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.518
Hey, what do you say
we rewind.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.810
Just go back to that
great ﬁrst-date
honeymoon period.

Uh...

19:19.450 --> 19:21.361
Holy crap.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.156
Look, Callie, I'm sorry.
I'm going to have
to call you back.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.954

What were you
doing down here?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.426
NATHAN: Bones?
Yeah.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.136
And they're human.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.064
And we don't know how old,
but Taggart's taking a look.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.317
So your theory
is Dr. Stone is
Hannibal Lecter?

19:56.404 --> 19:57.894
Yeah.
YOUNG: Dr. Blake,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

19:57.988 --> 20:01.776
but I need you
to sign off on the
seminar attendance sheets.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.403
Carter, the man
we're talking about

20:03.452 --> 20:05.943
is a Nobel laureate
in biochemistry.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.905
Yeah, and may be
a psychopath,

20:08.999 --> 20:11.581
so like you,
but violent.

20:11.669 --> 20:12.704
Give me time.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.664
You've got to admit.
It's a little weird.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.915
Oh, sorry.
Do you need something?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.917
No, I'm good.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.418
I just love the way
your lips move
when you talk.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.926
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

20:22.972 --> 20:25.258
Dr. Blake,
that is a wildly
inappropriate comment.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.431
Yeah.
Not to mention bizarre.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.091
Go ahead,
say something else.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.266
What?
Or don't.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.389
Yeah.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.519
Talk is cheap.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.098
Whoa!

20:36.152 --> 20:37.688
I've been wanting
to do that all day.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.018
Well, do it again
and I will beat you down.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.353

how are we feeling?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.456

20:53.502 --> 20:54.753
My head is
much clearer now.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.660
When he was in here,
I couldn't think.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.212
ljust wanted him.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.630
It was horrible.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.799
I can only imagine.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.334
CARTER ON INTERCOM:
You done yet?

21:04.972 --> 21:05.961
(EXHALES)

21:06.056 --> 21:08.308
No, I'm not
kidding, Carter.
It was frightening.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.178
I was out
ofconhol

21:10.269 --> 21:12.225
Yeah, it's been
happening all day.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.929
Jo kissed me,
but I didn't
put it together.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.563
Deputy Lupo
kissed you,

21:16.650 --> 21:18.436
and you didn't think
there was anything
wrong with that?

21:18.486 --> 21:21.728
Well, I’ve been working out.
I’m looking pretty good.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.406
Dr. Young,
this is supposedly
your field.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.528
You have
any thoughts?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.281
Yeah, sure. My thoughts are,
my reputation is destroyed

21:29.330 --> 21:31.195
becausel
Frenched the sheriff
in front of my boss.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.248
Anne, it's okay.
Just get yourself
under control.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.324
YOUNG: Of course.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.707
The biochemistry of
human sexual attraction
isn't well understood.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.380
It could be
a glandular disorder,

21:41.467 --> 21:44.459
an enzyme overgrowth,
a fungal infection, even.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.048
You know what?
We need to draw blood,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.924
and you need to stay
in the inﬁrmary.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.176
Well, I can't sit still.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.466
I mean,
I got toilets exploding

21:51.519 --> 21:53.134
and geysers shooting
out of the street.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.929
I think Eureka '3
got bigger problems
at the moment than me.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.763
Carter, I can't have you
running around out there.

21:57.858 --> 21:58.973
You're too
irresistible.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.062
I thought I was gonna
tear you apart.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.736
Good point.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.022
All right, but until
we figure this out,

22:06.075 --> 22:08.407
let's just
keep it quiet.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.029
Keep your distance, ma 'am.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.569
Step away
from the sheriff.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.950
You, keep your hands
where I can see them.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.542
Hot lunch,
coming through!

22:15.584 --> 22:17.040
Hey, do not
pierce the bubble.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.163
You, back that way.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.293
Hey, back in the elevator.
Fifteen feet, missy.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.961
All right, come on.
It’s clear.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.043
Very subtle, Fargo.
Thank you.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.970
So Stone uncovered
9,000-year—old bones?

22:33.060 --> 22:36.052
There were early human
settlements all through
this area,

22:36.146 --> 22:38.683
and these
were particularly
violent buggers.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.233
Well, that looks
like a head wound.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.602
Good eye.

22:42.903 --> 22:47.237
Fractures and weapon marks
all over these bones.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.987
I'd say they had
a bit of a dustup

22:50.077 --> 22:51.066
and then killed
each other.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.368
(WOLF BARKS)
Ooh. Your dogs
are wrestling.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.739
That's not wrestling,
Fargo.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.371
Isn't it beautiful?
They've been at it all day.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.752
I'm gonna have
to rejigger the formula
a bit, though.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.670
Fred's gonna
be knackered.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.248
Made him a wee bit
too irresistible.

23:06.802 --> 23:07.917
Wait, you did what?

23:07.970 --> 23:09.460
Can I get some of that?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.216
Sorry, Romeo.

23:11.265 --> 23:15.258
Canines and humans do have
a similar hormone chemistry,
but it wouldn't work.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.058
Are you sure?
Hey, I asked first.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.060
Besides, you got
all you can handle.
Exactly.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.813
Taggart, I think somehow
your pheromones got
transferred to me.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.893
I've been accosted
ever since I touched Fred.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.398
Fascinating.
If I touched Fred...

23:27.448 --> 23:30.656
Wait, wait.
I touched Fred
lots of times.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.656
I haven't noticed
any extra charisma.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.829
Well, how would you know?
You work down here alone!

23:36.916 --> 23:38.747
How many women have
even been down here?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.283
Well...
We've got
to test your mojo.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.132
Not sure I'm entirely
comfortable with this.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.005
That makes
two of us.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.213
Okay,
release the hounds.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.807
Go ahead, ladies.
Don’t be shy.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.434
Feel free to touch.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.189
G'day.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.486
You in the gray skirt!
How do you feel?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.362
Intensely uncomfortable.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.279
Wasn't this covered
in the seminar?

24:16.872 --> 24:19.909
ALLISON: Twenty different
women. They had absolutely
no interest in him.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.831
Well, what's this stuff
you found in my blood?

24:21.919 --> 24:23.125
It’s called
androstadiene.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.832
It’s one of
the hormones involved
with sexual attraction.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.792
According
to the blood test,
your eccrine gland

24:27.841 --> 24:31.629
is producing more than
379 parts per milliliter.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.044
Okay, is that a lot?

24:33.138 --> 24:36.551
That's 15,000 times
more than the usual amount.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.052
All right,
I'll take that as a yes.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.350
A woman exposed
to such high levels
of androstadiene

24:40.437 --> 24:44.180
could experience delusions,
erotomania, violence.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.359
It could overload
the female brain.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.313
And how much is
Taggart making?

24:48.362 --> 24:49.351
Well, he's normal.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.779
But, and this is weird,
the male wolf's levels
are sky high.

24:52.866 --> 24:56.029
Something over-stimulated
his eccrine gland as well.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.360
Taggan.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.408
So why is this potion
affecting us differently?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.911
Well, because
it's not a pheromone
serum, Sheriff.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.118
Taggart's cocktail affects
a completely different
peptide chain.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.713
It can't be
causing this.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.620
Oh, great. Okay.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.719
And I still haven't found
the guy who can stop
the town from exploding.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.422
Great. Please,
keep me posted

25:14.513 --> 25:17.129
if you find out that
I have anything else
in common with the wolf,

25:17.224 --> 25:19.840
and get a bullhorn.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.884
Carter, Dr. Young
is going to need

25:21.979 --> 25:24.345
to take some more samples
from you before you leave.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.888
Okay. Take as much
blood as you want,

25:27.568 --> 25:30.526
Actually,
I need a sample
of something else.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.855
Need a magazine?

25:37.578 --> 25:38.988
Oh...

25:40.831 --> 25:42.492
FARGO:
Just a few more minutes,
everybody.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.494
Please, please,
be patient.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.951
Fargo, ljust need
to talk to Carter
for a second.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.456
Sorry, no can do.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.788
He's off-limits
to the ladies
until further notice.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.714
He's been getting way
too much action lately.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.876
Okay, well,
just tell him
that I came by.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.419
Yeah, okay,
I'll put you
on the list.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.766

Everybody, just stand back
a little while longer.

with tarragon mustard.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.099
Now can I please have
my female customers back?

26:03.187 --> 26:05.428
Yeah, I'm just trying
to figure out
a timeline here.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.137
Do you remember
the last time Dr. Stone

26:07.232 --> 26:08.608
came in here
to pick up his lunch?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.481
Yeah, he comes in
every day.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.070
Until today, that is.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.945
Too bad, too.
Cevapcici burgers
are his favorite,

26:14.990 --> 26:18.107
unlike some other
culinary philistines
I won't name.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.741
Wait, today?

26:19.787 --> 26:22.870
Did Mrs. Stone pick up
cevapcici burgers?

26:22.956 --> 26:24.662
Mmm-hmm.
Two orders.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.795
Thanks.
Yeah.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.923
Mrs. Stone?
Wait.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.092
All right,
we're clean.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.472
Fantastic.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.595
CARTER: Mrs. Stone?

26:44.645 --> 26:46.101
I'd feel better
if I was packing heat.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.932
Well, I'm not
giving you a gun,
Fargo.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.142
But what if
some woman attacks?
They're like ninjas.

of platinum rods...

was working fine yesterday.

how hot it was
in your house?

she was keeping it warm
because it was sultry,

I may regret this,

27:42.035 --> 27:45.778
but you want to
tell me what happened
with you and Judy?

27:47.166 --> 27:51.205
We were eating dinner,
and Judy looked at me
over the tuna casserole.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.373
I hadn't seen that look
in 15 years.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.583
We were like
newlyweds again.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.835

what it was like.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.297
Actually, yeah,
I think he does.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.547

No!

28:07.186 --> 28:10.929

28:11.815 --> 28:13.555
I can't even walk
down the street.

with a gland producing
too much of something.

with Judy and me,

imprisoned you
in your bedroom?

to believe that she
loved me that much.

we have in common
are your wolves.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.700
I know it's tenuous,

31:12.746 --> 31:15.328
but I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.873
Where's Wilma?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.717
I had the vet tech
take her for a walk.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.263
Not healthy for her
to sit around

31:34.601 --> 31:36.432
after such
a big meal.

31:37.646 --> 31:38.977
I'm sorry.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.596
Yeah.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.561
Taggan,
what is this stuff?

31:43.944 --> 31:46.902
Animal cage.
Lots of dust and dirt.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.523
I think I've seen this
somewhere before.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.361
There were mineral deposits
and stuff all through
the rocks.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.661
The dust
was everywhere.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.080
I don't see how
a mineral could have
this kind of effect.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.538
Well...
Because it's not
a mineral.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.704
It's a pre-mitotic
haploid.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.506
Better known as
your basic spore.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.300
Hardy little biological
bugger, too.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.758
Just napping until the
right host came along.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.173
That would be
Dr. Stone
and then me.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.633
We were both down
in that chamber.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.972
Oh, I gave it a quick
"How do you do."

32:20.021 --> 32:24.060
Mostly hydrocarbons
and some trace aminos.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.938
And, you ready?
Thymosin.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.318
That's a peptide.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.443
(CARTER STAMMERING)

32:29.489 --> 32:31.650
Could that mess
with my eccrine gland?

32:31.741 --> 32:33.527
In large concentrations,
definitely.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.453
Well, Carter,
you and Stone
were down there.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.031
How did the wolves
get exposed?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.613
Well, because they're
Siberian wolves.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.577
Tundra.
Siberian tundra wolves.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.579
Stone patched through
an emergency vent

32:43.670 --> 32:45.331
to keep them cool
in case the system
shut down.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.245
The spores must have
found their way
to that vent.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.002
Probably down there
for thousands of years,
just waiting.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.256
Yeah, but could they
still really be viable
after all that time?

32:53.346 --> 32:56.713
Anthrax spores can survive
in the soil for centuries,
and when they're uncovered

32:56.808 --> 32:58.014
they're just as deadly.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.640
Well, it looks like
this one's deadly, too.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.769
It might explain
what happened to
our prehistoric friends.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.393
Taggart, could you bring
those samples to my lab?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.145
Good job, Carter.
Thanks.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.900
I’ll get to work on a way
to counteract the effects.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.022
Thank you.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.060
Shh.

You feel that?

33:14.701 --> 33:15.986
Oh, my God.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.112
What?

33:17.287 --> 33:18.527
Stone.

33:19.456 --> 33:20.866
He fixed
the air conditioning.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.743
The spores
are gonna spread.

(INSTRUMENT BUZZING)

33:31.176 --> 33:32.837
Getting all this?

33:32.886 --> 33:34.968
Spore concentration
looks pretty bad.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.386
Yeah, just drive
to the next waypoint

33:36.473 --> 33:38.054
and take the
next reading,
all right?

33:38.099 --> 33:39.350
All right.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.016
CARTER:
How bad is it?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.678
Well, according
to Fargo's measurements,
it's all over town.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.268
Great. How's Dr. Young
coming on our antidote?

33:47.359 --> 33:50.317
She'll have enough serum
for you and Dr. Stone
by the end of the day.

33:50.403 --> 33:54.066
Well, that’s great,
but we need some
for every male in town.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.534
Well, it's gonna
take some time
to grow the cultures.

33:56.576 --> 33:57.565
A couple days.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.901
Days!

33:58.954 --> 34:00.945
We'll have ripped
each other apart
by then!

34:01.039 --> 34:03.496
I think that
we're gonna have
to consider evacuation.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.244
All female residents
can be transported

34:05.293 --> 34:09.127
to Ellsworth Air Force Base
until we can produce
a viable counteragent.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.294
Wait.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.211
Allison, how do you feel
about Henry?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.591
What?
He's my friend?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.089
Henry, you were
in the tunnels
before I was.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.966
How come she's not
all over you?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.093
My mask,
my dust filter.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.299
No, you weren’t
wearing a mask.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.134
No, I was.
You couldn't see it.

34:25.939 --> 34:28.021
An electrostatic filter.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.348
What does it do?
I have asthma.

34:29.442 --> 34:33.230
This is a casein-based
suspension that completely
coats any foreign particle.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.067
Okay. Uh...
No, what does it do?

34:36.116 --> 34:38.072
It binds with the spores.
It makes it impossible

34:38.118 --> 34:40.279
for them
to be absorbed
into the body.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.784
How much of this stuff
can we make?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.372
No, the production
isn't the problem.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.616
It's the distribution.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.824
We can't get
a little spray bottle
into every man's hand,

34:46.918 --> 34:50.251
not before they breathe in
enough spores to be
affected like you.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.003
What if we spray it
everywhere ?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.751
Use crop-dusters,
helicopters.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.085
Will that clean the spores
out of the air?

34:55.135 --> 34:57.296
Yes, if they breathe it in.
But we can't use helicopters,

34:57.387 --> 34:59.469
because in order
to get it into
every lung,

34:59.556 --> 35:01.547
we have to get it
into every building.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.140
Well, you know what?

35:04.227 --> 35:06.218
This town needs an enema.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.561
I’m on it.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.474
STONE: So, we're gonna
pump asthma medicine

35:12.569 --> 35:13.979
through Eureka's
cooling system?

35:14.070 --> 35:16.447
HENRY:
Yeah, and it'll
neutralize the spores.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.156
This one?
Yeah.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.279
This goes everywhere?

35:22.329 --> 35:23.990
Pump it in there,
it will wash out
the whole system.

that the electrostatic filter
is distributed everywhere.

a violation, you know?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.086
Don't worry.
We'll be gentle.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.414
Make sure the seal
is good. We only have
enough for one time.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.044
Let me know
when you're ready.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.298
Okay. Let it go.

down here, Eureka's safe.

down there?

pressure. It should...

CARTER: Stop!
It's leaking!

35:55.862 --> 35:58.023

isn't calculating
the volume.

Not looking good.

a town full of men just
as attractive as you are.

Yeah, are you sure
this is going to
reach everyone?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.772
Well, the flow distribution
grid is solid.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.976
Anyone who's breathing
should be safe.

still believe in love.

but my thumb pad is broken.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.476

falling apart.

Can you let me in?

37:52.187 --> 37:53.677
I'm sorry, Henry.
I can't.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.683
Of course you can.
Just use your override.

talking about?

38:05.658 --> 38:08.650
I think that it's time
for you to start moving
on to other projects.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.110

38:10.163 --> 38:11.744
Why are you
doing this to me?

39:00.964 --> 39:02.249
No?

39:02.340 --> 39:05.047
I think I've been
pretty clear about that.

what would you like?

Henry, there are
things going on which
you just don't understand.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.024
Then explain it to me.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.948
I can't.
I'm sorry.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.658
But it's the way
it has to be.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.453
No. No, it doesn't.

been a bad idea.

about this weekend.
