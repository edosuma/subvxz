WEBVTT

00:01.292 --> 00:02.502
Is it making me look too, like?

00:02.669 --> 00:06.089
Like a person wearing a lowcut top
but who's actually still a virgin?

00:06.089 --> 00:09.509
Honestly, like,
I'm just so ready to lose it.

00:09.509 --> 00:13.096
- What about that guy Tim?
- It's Tim's if he wants it.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.683
- Wish I could fuck you all day.
- Shit, I'm gonna be late for class.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.394
Our little Bree-Bree
is gonna be a nude model.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.603
For art class.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.273
I'm not sleeping with anyone else.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.983
- Neither am I.
- Okay.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.735
It wouldn't bother me if you did, though.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.154
You have a really nice smile.
You have a boyfriend?

00:29.863 --> 00:30.864
No, I don't.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.283
- I was gonna go on the pill.
- You don't have to worry.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.870
You are the only person
who I wouldn't use a condom with.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.998
Everything's my fault.
I can't stop thinking about her, man.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.541
What the fuck
was all of that about?

00:41.666 --> 00:43.168
Drew was there
the night Macy died.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.086
This is my little brother
we're talking about, all right?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.671
You cannot tell anyone.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.777
- Oh, my God. You're adorable.
- Oh, my God.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.361
I'm not trying to give
mixed signals tonight.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.946
- Yes!
- The signal is very clear.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.406
You're very much a sure thing.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.825
Yeah, Tim is gonna die when he sees you.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.036
I still think you should just come
with us.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.829
It's a couples party.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.248
- So, make Stephen come.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.044
Stephen hates frat parties,
and he has his big interview tomorrow.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.755
Yeah, but you wanna go,
so he should just go with you.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.800
You went on the pill
so he could fuck you without a condom.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.510
It's the least he can do.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.932
We're gonna hang at his. It's fine.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.101
Okay.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.582
- Wrigley!
- Pippa!

02:05.041 --> 02:06.167
Nice to see you.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.420
- Hey, guys.
- How long do we stay handcuffed?

02:09.504 --> 02:11.131
Until we both finish a bottle.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.634
- Bree, who's your date?
- Tim.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.802
That's nice.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.887
I want a cigarette.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.597
- Another one?
- Yeah.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.599
Oh, my God.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.547
You look amazing.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.675
Thank you.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.522
- How do we get these off?
- It's cool. I'll take 'em off later.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.607
- Okay.
- Come on.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.539
Okay.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.001
- Fuck.
- It's...

03:30.001 --> 03:31.836
- Yeah, okay, all right.
- Just fuck it.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.507
Okay.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.261
Let me grab a condom.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.474
Yes. Thank God.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.147
Come on. Yes.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.372
You okay?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.999
- Yeah.
- You sure?

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
Yes.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.769
What time's your train?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.021
It's at noon.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.233
But I have to run
through some case studies before I go.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.611
Explain to me how this internship is paid

06:01.611 --> 06:04.989
if the whole point of it being unpaid is
to prove you really want it?

06:05.281 --> 06:06.324
A lot of internships are paid.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.201
Not everyone can afford the unpaid ones,
you know?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.161
- You're gonna get it.
- Eh.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.164
And after my India trip this summer,
I can come visit you in the city.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.375
I'm sure I'll be up against
some partner's sons.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.710
That's usually the deal with these things.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.546
Well, I'm sure none of them have practiced
hard as you have.

06:20.713 --> 06:25.468
And it'll just be boring trust fund kids,
wearing pastel pants.

06:25.843 --> 06:29.180
Unfortunately, boring trust fund kids
with pastel pants,

06:29.514 --> 06:30.807
they often do very well...

06:31.099 --> 06:32.141
- Yeah?
- ...in this country.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.396
Well,
you're gonna be the smartest guy there.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.035
You're so fucking sexy.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.122
You're a liability.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.917
Quit distracting me.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.920
Get dressed.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.046
Fine.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.442
Who you staying with in the city?

07:26.028 --> 07:27.405
- Hey!
- Hey.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.489
Yo!

07:29.991 --> 07:35.329
Evan hooked me up with his family's loft
in Tribeca. He's a hero.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.625
I should get going.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.086
Good luck.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.923
- Call me after, okay?
- Of course.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.092
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.803
- Bye, Lucy.
- Bye.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.142
Seriously, dude?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.519
You couldn't come up with a better lie?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.646
We don't even have a place in the city.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.440
You got houses everywhere else, right?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.651
I can't tell her I'm staying
at Diana's family spot. No way.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.323
You know, sometimes I just think you lie
for the fun of it.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.496
- What?
- No, I just... I'm...

08:16.496 --> 08:18.456
I'm never gonna get over the fact
that you're taking

08:18.915 --> 08:21.209
an introduction to drawing class.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.002
What do you do in there? Draw fruit?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.546
As a matter of fact,
I drew a pineapple last week.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.298
How was it? Was it good?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.259
Nah, but it was terrible.
I can't draw for shit.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.220
It's an easy credit though, so...

08:34.263 --> 08:35.264
Yeah.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.601
If you do the math.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.521
You're probably costing your parents
at least 5K.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.610
I can't imagine what my mom would say
if I told her I was spending her money

08:47.944 --> 08:50.071
drawing fucking pineapples.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.698
Well,

08:53.157 --> 08:55.535
you know, people go to college
for different reasons.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.913
I'm just trying to figure out
what I wanna do after graduation.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.415
Junior year, though.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.128
Isn't your dad like a genius or something?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.797
What about your dad?

09:09.507 --> 09:10.633
Ooh.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.513
I fucking love that.
I love when you stoop to my level.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.141
All right, well,
pineapples are waiting so...

09:19.225 --> 09:21.060
Hey, for what it's worth...

09:22.103 --> 09:24.647
- you are my favorite multimillionaire.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.817
- You're obnoxious.
- Yeah, I got a nice smile, though.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.902
Yeah, yeah, calm down.
Have a good interview.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.987
Thank you, bro.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.039
- Morning.
- Good morning.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.876
- What were you just daydreaming about?
- Oh...

09:46.586 --> 09:48.796
Nothing. I'm just really hungover.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.673
- Got ya!
- Stephen left today, right?

09:50.881 --> 09:51.882
Yeah, how'd you know that?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.384
Wrigley told me.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.846
Did Wrigley say anything...

09:57.388 --> 09:59.557
else about Stephen?

10:00.641 --> 10:02.143
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.979
I'm just... just trying to get some intel.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.689
I swear he hasn't said anything, okay?

10:07.231 --> 10:09.317
- Okay?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.736
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.405
You disappeared last night, what happened?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.826
- No!
- Oh, my God!

10:19.368 --> 10:21.162
- Yes! Fuck!

10:23.039 --> 10:24.332
Okay, how was it?

10:24.874 --> 10:25.916
It was...

10:26.584 --> 10:30.796
- It was fine. It was kinda funny.
- Oh.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.257
I don't know how else to describe it but...

10:34.634 --> 10:37.470
I mean, I'm sure it gets better.
I'm like excited to do it again.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.805
- So, you didn't cum.
- What?

10:39.889 --> 10:42.183
- Nobody cums their first time.
- I did.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.268
Orgasms are really easy for me.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.899
- What? They are.
- So, are you gonna see him again?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.442
Well, he said he'd text me.

10:51.817 --> 10:52.818
Cute.

10:53.277 --> 10:57.573
- Am I becoming promiscuous?
- I love this.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.660
Seems so much hotter than Drew, too.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.828
Aren't you kinda happy he ghosted you now?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
Okay. Don't do that, come on.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.667
- Do what?
- He's Wrigley's brother. It's mean.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.711
It was a joke. And he was a dick to Bree.

11:10.795 --> 11:11.879
Weeks ago.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.048
We can get over it now.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.218
Okay. Sorry.

11:18.969 --> 11:19.929
Hey!

11:20.805 --> 11:22.014
- No.
- Wow.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.724
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.726
Oh, hey, Bree.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.854
How'd... how'd your night end?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.607
- It was good, thanks.
- Good.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.568
Very good. Tell Stephen he's a loser
for leaving Halloween weekend.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.237
- Who the fuck does that?
- I know.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.197
But it's a big internship, so...

11:38.197 --> 11:42.326
That guy never slows down. Personally,
I blame Diana, she encouraged the mania.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.662
What do you mean?

11:45.579 --> 11:47.707
Uh, nothing. Just joking... I...

11:47.707 --> 11:50.292
- I'm so fucking hungover.
-  Yeah.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.877
You blame Diana for what?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.757
I was just... I was just saying that,
you know, they're both like that.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.593
They're both obsessed with work,
so when you put 'em together,

11:59.677 --> 12:01.178
it's like the...
the Clintons or something.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.889
Is Diana like an amazing student
or something?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.266
- Diana?
- Mm-hmm.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.059
Yeah, she's, like, super... super driven.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.855
But that's probably why you're more fun
for him, you know? It's less intense.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.441
- Jesus Christ, Wrigley.
- Lucy's really driven, too.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.567
Yes.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.611
Yes, I'm sorry. Yes.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.239
That's not what I... Don't listen to me.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.003
Hi, Professor, do you have a... a moment?

12:34.336 --> 12:35.337
Sure.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.675
I've noticed I keep getting B pluses
on everything.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.386
Is there something specific
I could be working on, or...

12:43.012 --> 12:44.680
Your form is impressive,

12:45.139 --> 12:48.893
but I think you'd agree you struggle
to push yourself to your full potential.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.313
Your writing lacks specificity sometimes.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.399
You need to tap into something
more specific

12:55.858 --> 12:56.859
and personal.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.781
Okay. I will try harder.

13:02.490 --> 13:07.411
I... I also, um, wanted to ask you
about your advanced seminar next semester.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.706
Well, that's very competitive.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.334
I know, but I'd... I'd really like
to be considered for it.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.420
You know, so I can push myself,
like you said.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.216
It's almost November. May I ask you
why you're just inquiring about it now?

13:21.509 --> 13:22.760
Um...

13:23.719 --> 13:25.387
I... I guess, I've just been...

13:25.971 --> 13:26.972
distracted.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.517
And what specifically
has been distracting you?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.859
I don't know if you know this, um...

13:40.528 --> 13:41.987
but the girl who died...

13:43.239 --> 13:47.201
during Welcome Week, Macy,
she... she was my roommate.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.998
And I'm usually a lot more focused.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.168
That must've been awful.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.796
I'm sorry, Lucy. I didn't know.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.592
Look, let's see
how the rest of the semester goes.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.180
I appreciate your openness, and I think
we can probably figure something out.

14:08.973 --> 14:09.974
Thanks.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.761
Whenever you're ready, Bree.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.152
- (OVER PHONE) <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.991
I'm sitting in your dad's office
right now. This place is crazy.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.243
<i>Don't go through any of his stuff.</i>

16:34.243 --> 16:37.204
Obviously. Hey,
what's with this weird painting in here?

16:38.747 --> 16:42.167
<i>- He's obsessed with that thing.</i>
- Looks like a finger painting.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.545
Okay, please tell me he didn't spend
real money on that thing.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.756
<i>It's probably the most expensive thing
in the loft.</i>

16:47.923 --> 16:50.843
Really? It...
it looks like a preschooler did it.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.596
<i>You kinda have to know
about art to appreciate it.</i>

16:54.763 --> 16:58.267
<i>- Just don't touch it, okay?</i>
- Why would I touch it?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.854
<i>I don't know. I gotta go,
but good luck tomorrow.</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:05.357
<i>Just be yourself
until you really shouldn't be.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:08.068
<i>- You know what I mean.</i>
- Okay.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.448
- Thanks.
<i>- Talk to you later, bye.</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:43.395
Can we just... I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.938
But we need to talk about it,

17:45.022 --> 17:47.066
-'cause it's a lot. I...
- I understand it's a lot, but I don't...

17:48.192 --> 17:49.943
I don't know what you want me to do.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.279
I'm gonna go to the dining hall.
I'm starving.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.699
Are you coming?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.743
I'll meet you there.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.924
Hey, you okay?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.384
It's just like a stupid fight.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.428
You wanna talk about it?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.014
I'm fine. I should go catch up with him.

18:19.181 --> 18:23.227
Stephen can be a dick sometimes, too.
And I... I actually felt

18:23.352 --> 18:25.354
- really weird this morning...
- We don't have to swap stories.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.606
It's not really the same thing.
You and Stephen

18:27.606 --> 18:29.566
- aren't even, like...
- Aren't even, like, what?

18:30.317 --> 18:33.821
I just mean you guys
haven't put labels on things.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.367
You don't have an obligation to him.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.787
Obligation? That's a weird word to use.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.208
Look, I told him I would meet him, so...

18:48.752 --> 18:49.753
Okay.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.233
Where were you tonight?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.026
Bunch of us went to George's.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.862
You smell like tequila.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.673
It's fine. No, just leave it on.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.598
Fuck.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.483
I'm going to need you to get me going.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.485
Okay.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.906
Okay.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.344
- I... is it... is that okay?
- Yeah.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.971
Just... just keep going'
for a second, it's 'cause I did blow.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.686
Wait, stop. Get up for a second.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.529
- Touch yourself.
- What?

20:39.905 --> 20:41.990
I want to see you touch yourself...

20:55.921 --> 20:56.922
Yeah.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.134
Oh, yeah.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.152
- Wait. Here, let me... let me...
- No, I love it like this.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.284
Give me a sec. Wait. There.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.287
Yes.

21:34.835 --> 21:40.007
- I... I think I'm a little sore.
- It's all right, we'll go softer, okay?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.634
- Okay.

21:47.931 --> 21:51.184
- W... wait, let me turn on my back.
- It's okay, I'm almost there.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.145
Okay.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.719
My mom is so funny, if I ever sent her

22:25.719 --> 22:28.472
an eight-pound box of candy,
she would consider it an assault.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.350
Does she send care packages
for every holiday?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.603
Yeah, pretty much. Such a waste of money.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.526
I saw Tim last night.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.987
And? How was it?

22:45.572 --> 22:48.658
I don't know.
I mean, he's definitely into me,

22:48.742 --> 22:52.829
but I'm just trying to figure out
if I actually like him.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.081
You're not sure yet?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.710
When I first had sex with Stephen,
it was like...

23:00.170 --> 23:01.838
my body just knew.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.176
Is it really different
than with your ex-boyfriend?

23:07.636 --> 23:08.678
Yeah.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.015
Completely. I wasn't like Pippa,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.726
I wasn't having orgasms
all the time in high school.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.104
With Stephen, it's just like...

23:20.857 --> 23:22.609
I didn't know my body
could feel that good.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.655
So, how was it with Tim?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.410
So hot.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.887
Trey.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.357
Stephen?

24:03.483 --> 24:04.484
Hi.

24:05.944 --> 24:06.945
Follow me.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.289
My... my bus driver still calls me
for legal advice.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.708
- You're funny.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.627
The last candidate quoted me
his SAT scores within five minutes.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.589
- Oh, God.
- Shall we start your first case?

24:26.214 --> 24:27.757
Yes. Please.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.323
- Drew.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.366
I saw you so...

24:54.201 --> 24:55.619
I wanted to say hi.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.746
Hi.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.664
Listen...

25:01.249 --> 25:03.835
I... I feel really bad about Welcome Week.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.839
- And I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
- Oh...

25:08.590 --> 25:10.634
- Yeah, it was shitty of me.
- Yeah.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.220
Really hurt my feelings.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.347
I didn't mean to.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.432
Okay.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.560
Yeah, it's okay.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.355
I'm not gonna, like, hook up with you now.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.148
If that's what you think.

25:25.941 --> 25:26.983
I... I didn't.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.653
Good.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.673
The first priority
is to keep the client happy.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.591
So, in my case, a professor.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.260
The minute you know,

25:53.260 --> 25:55.554
you won't meet their expectations,
you have to change them.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.264
So, you have to make them think

25:57.764 --> 26:00.850
that the new timeline was their idea.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.189
So, by the time I handed in that project,
my professor...

26:07.440 --> 26:08.441
thought it was early.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.194
I think I had a similar professor.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.821
- Where'd you go?
- Cambridge.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.282
- Mm.
- It was great. I love England,

26:15.407 --> 26:16.866
everywhere in Europe, honestly.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.077
Gosh, me, too. Definitely.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.495
Have you spent much time abroad?

26:21.037 --> 26:24.874
Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.
Europe's... Europe's amazing.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.502
Where have you been?

26:28.461 --> 26:31.172
All over. Really. Um...

26:31.590 --> 26:34.593
Uh, London. I went to Paris.

26:35.051 --> 26:36.928
Um, Rome.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.097
I rented a flat in the Marais last summer.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.891
- I had the best time.
- Yeah, Rome, every part...

26:42.392 --> 26:44.603
Italy, it's just so... It's beautiful.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.439
The Marais in Paris.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.816
Mm-hmm.

26:49.983 --> 26:53.194
I know, no, I know. I was just saying
that I love... that Rome is beauti...

26:53.278 --> 26:55.488
Like, it's one of my favorite cities
in the world.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.324
- Um...

26:57.616 --> 26:58.992
But I...

27:00.744 --> 27:04.122
I do, I love... I love Paris.
Paris is so...

27:04.122 --> 27:07.417
It's the city of, you know, city of love.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.755
All right. Next question.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.256
Yes.

27:13.548 --> 27:16.134
The client is a health insurance company,

27:16.551 --> 27:18.762
you are a civil defense attorney,

27:18.762 --> 27:20.597
specializing in medical law.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.850
A plastic surgeon is being accused
of botching a surgery,

27:23.850 --> 27:27.562
but the plaintiff is a self-professed
addict of plastic surgery.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.564
How do you advise the client?

27:30.315 --> 27:31.316
Are you the client?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.319
The client is the client.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.614
Sure, but in this scenario,
when I imagine the client...

27:39.449 --> 27:40.617
am I picturing you?

27:42.160 --> 27:43.411
Why does that matter?

27:43.620 --> 27:44.996
I want to know how to talk to you.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.833
The job is legal advice.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.713
No, I know it's... it... but isn't it also
reading the room, you know,

27:53.797 --> 27:55.924
don't you change the way you are
when you're with certain people?

27:55.924 --> 27:58.760
I'm just saying,
I... I think about people when I...

27:59.844 --> 28:02.430
I have to tell them something, so I...
I look at them, and I think about them,

28:02.514 --> 28:06.184
and I think about who they are,
as people, you know? And that...

28:07.227 --> 28:09.646
helps. It helps to figure out...

28:11.981 --> 28:12.982
kind of...

28:16.319 --> 28:18.530
How you...  It helps.

28:19.906 --> 28:20.907
Yeah.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.953
Maybe I should just start quoting
my SAT scores to you.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.664
- That's fine. I think we're good.
- Yeah.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.835
It's 1540, for the record.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.963
But let's be real.

28:36.756 --> 28:39.008
I mean, one of the boss' kids
is going to get this, right?

28:39.134 --> 28:41.261
You're hiring one of them
before I even walked in the room.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.931
There's actually a company policy
against that.

28:45.765 --> 28:50.562
When selecting interns, we consider
not only who's the most qualified,

28:50.854 --> 28:53.022
but who would benefit most
from the opportunity.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.077
- MALE VOICE 1: Yeah! Yeah, let's do that.
- MALE VOICE 2: I'll see you there.

29:10.623 --> 29:11.624
Oh, God.

29:15.503 --> 29:17.505
- Oh, my...
- Yo, let's do shots.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.591
Yes. I gotta pee first.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.690
- Hey, Tim.
- Yo, what up?

29:40.028 --> 29:41.571
- Is my mustache even?
- I'm embarrassed.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.031
- Yeah, looks good.
- Yeah, looks good.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.574
How was the bathroom?

29:44.699 --> 29:46.659
It was a bathroom.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.953
But how gross was it?
Was there toilet paper?

29:49.078 --> 29:51.289
- Oh, no, no, there wasn't.
- Oh, wonderful.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.167
Oh, wonderful, wow, that's crazy.
You guys are being pretty lame.

29:54.167 --> 29:58.630
- We're not being lame, we're just tired.
- All right. Let's go, then.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.132
- Whoo!
- That's your solution?

30:01.216 --> 30:03.301
- Cocaine?
- Come on, seriously?

30:03.426 --> 30:04.844
Yeah, what?
Have you never done blow before?

30:04.928 --> 30:07.096
- No.
- Yeah, of course, I have.

30:07.222 --> 30:11.017
- Then you know that it's great.
- Yeah, but I'm not in the mood tonight.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.603
Well, that's the point. Once you do it,
you'll be in the mood for it.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.480
Fuck it, I'll try it.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.690
Follow the bird.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.318
Okay.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.742
- I don't really feel anything.
- Really?

30:28.451 --> 30:29.869
I think I do.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.121
Well, you would know,
you've done it before, right?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.875
Yeah. No, I just mean like, I'm waiting
to see how I feel before I do more.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.795
- Right.
- Bree, how do you feel?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.549
- I think I love it.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.676
You're in a good mood tonight.

30:45.176 --> 30:48.513
Oh, yeah. Great mood.
I'm in the best mood ever.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.931
Come here, my Freud.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.934
Waddup, waddup?

30:52.934 --> 30:55.019
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.230
- Where's Evan?
- Oh, fuck him.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.565
They're fighting.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:00.525 --> 31:04.112
This pirate costume is so cute.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.990
Thanks. I... I really like your tiara.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.200
- It's really cute.
- Thanks. I put it on myself.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.620
Wow. You don't have someone
to do that for you?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.666
- We're gonna go get a drink.
- Okay, cool. I'm gonna hang here, so...

31:21.588 --> 31:22.589
Cool.

31:25.842 --> 31:29.012
- That was fucking weird, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.558
Sorry. I'll... I'll be right back.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.979
Were you not gonna talk to me tonight?

31:37.979 --> 31:41.149
'Cause, I mean, I don't need you
to do anything, like, special,

31:41.149 --> 31:43.276
but don't act
like I'm not even fucking here.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.905
I can't believe you didn't tell me
you were a virgin.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.909
- Who told you that?
- Wrigley told Cyclops.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.619
I mean putting that much pressure
on me

31:52.619 --> 31:54.579
- without saying anything is fucked up.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.373
Wh... Are you...
are you serious right now?

31:58.041 --> 32:02.170
You tricked me into taking your virginity.
It's too much responsibility.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.881
I didn't trick you into anything.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.551
I didn't give you any kind
of responsibility, I didn't tell you

32:08.635 --> 32:10.511
because it wasn't your business.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.931
Whatever. I just don't think
we should hook up again.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.058
Yeah, no shit.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.850
Hey, how'd it go?

32:58.184 --> 32:59.185
Great.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.231
<i>Any chance you wanna come to the city
and celebrate? I miss you.</i>

33:27.005 --> 33:28.673
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.217
Too much room.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.346
- I don't know what to do with it.
- Wow.

33:36.222 --> 33:40.184
- These are the lowly servants' quarters.
- Wow.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.521
- Fancy.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.440
You want a drink?

33:46.315 --> 33:47.442
Yes.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.445
Yeah.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.089
So, tell me everything.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.926
Just went really, really well.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.011
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.471
When do you find out if you get it?

34:30.359 --> 34:33.446
Where do you want me? Right here?

34:46.125 --> 34:47.293
Is that too hard?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.087
No.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.258
You can go harder.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.149
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hello?</i>

35:10.274 --> 35:11.275
Drew...

35:12.610 --> 35:13.945
I'm outside your dorm.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.030
Will you come downstairs?

35:56.445 --> 35:57.697
What? What's wrong?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.701
Come here.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.924
I won't know what I did
if you don't tell me.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.568
Why don't you ever go
to parties with me?

36:40.656 --> 36:41.657
What?

36:42.950 --> 36:45.036
Why don't you ever go to parties with me?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.336
Wha...

36:55.338 --> 36:56.505
We go to parties.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.218
- We met at one. Remember?
- No, I mean... I mean together,

37:00.218 --> 37:03.346
like we don't go anywhere
where you would actually know someone.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.972
I take you on actual dates.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.309
Do you not enjoy those?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.771
- No...
- They cost a lot of money.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.440
I like those.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.069
You're... you're missing the point,
I don't know why

37:18.069 --> 37:20.655
- you have to make it about money.
- Because I don't have any.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.073
My family doesn't have any money,

37:22.073 --> 37:23.866
I don't have an allowance
like the rest of you guys.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.452
Oh, my God, you act
like I'm fucking loaded or something.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.830
Have you ever been to Europe?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.126
Yeah.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.089
I haven't.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.220
- Okay.
- I've never been on a plane.

37:46.472 --> 37:49.684
But you've talked about traveling before.
You've told stories.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.560
Yeah, that's what they are,
they're stories

37:51.686 --> 37:53.396
to make everyone else
feel more comfortable

37:53.396 --> 37:54.981
because people hear
that you're 20 years old

37:54.981 --> 37:56.482
and you've never been
on a fucking airplane.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.025
And they think that's weird.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.277
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.444
Well, I don't think it's weird,

38:00.528 --> 38:02.446
and I don't even really know
what your point is right now.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.200
My point is that what I choose
to spend my money on

38:06.575 --> 38:07.618
means something.

38:10.746 --> 38:14.709
And I choose to spend my money
on taking you on dates off-campus.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.379
To make you feel special.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.174
I'm sorry. I didn't...

38:24.010 --> 38:26.178
I didn't think about it that way.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.690
- Are you mad at me now?
- I'm tired.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.284
Please, don't be mad at me, I... I...
I shouldn't have said anything.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.036
- I don't know why I said anything.
- No, it's really okay.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.913
- I'm being dramatic and I don't...
- It's okay. Don't worry.

39:06.052 --> 39:10.389
I'd say, talk in my room
but my roommate's in there,

39:10.473 --> 39:11.515
- so...
- This is fine.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.979
What's up? What did you wanna talk about?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.190
Are you attracted to me?

39:21.609 --> 39:23.235
You were at one point.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.864
Yeah, yeah, no, I am.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.268
Fuck.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.355
Wait, wait, I thought you said
that we would...

39:59.355 --> 40:00.606
Do you want me to stop?

40:01.065 --> 40:02.650
No.

40:24.547 --> 40:28.759
- Fuck. Sorry, shit. Sorry.
- That's okay.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.488
I... I thought you hated me.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.703
No.  No.

41:02.501 --> 41:04.336
Bree, something happened
during Welcome Week.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.881
And I... I would tell you
if I could but...

41:08.799 --> 41:11.552
It wasn't because I...
I didn't like you, okay?

41:14.638 --> 41:15.890
Yeah, okay.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.272
What made you wanna see me?

41:27.193 --> 41:28.986
I don't know, I... I thought...

41:31.614 --> 41:33.532
I thought it would make me feel better

41:34.366 --> 41:35.451
about some stuff.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.704
Did it?

41:41.957 --> 41:44.043
Yeah, a little.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.714
This isn't happening again, though.

41:51.550 --> 41:52.551
Okay.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.321
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.534
- How are you feeling?
- Great.

42:18.160 --> 42:22.748
- I'm really sorry about last night.
- That's okay, sorry if I... I overreacted.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.501
Listen, Evan's parents need the place,

42:25.501 --> 42:27.586
so I think
you should take the 10:00 a.m. train.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.088
You'll make it if you hurry.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.887
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That's so exciting.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.361
What do you got there?

42:53.737 --> 42:55.030
Are you stalking me?

42:56.031 --> 42:58.450
Guy draws you naked one time...

42:59.743 --> 43:02.454
Actually just picking up
my mom's latest QVC finds.

43:02.621 --> 43:03.956
Yeah, she's an addict.

43:06.542 --> 43:07.626
Thank you, by the way.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.169
For what?

43:09.837 --> 43:13.841
For drawing me naked and not being a perv
about it.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.260
Yeah, you know, that's kind
of my thing,

43:16.969 --> 43:18.679
very non-pervy.

43:19.221 --> 43:21.849
Well, that's good, yeah,
Allie's very lucky.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.392
Well...

43:24.268 --> 43:25.477
we broke up actually.

43:26.437 --> 43:30.065
- Shit, sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Needed to happen.

43:30.566 --> 43:31.692
I guess, college relationships

43:31.692 --> 43:33.736
don't really matter
in the long term, anyway so...

43:36.989 --> 43:40.200
"Remember, trust no one
unless they have a moose,

43:40.909 --> 43:43.912
then steal the moose
and only trust the moose."

43:44.204 --> 43:45.205
Who sent you that?

43:45.372 --> 43:47.374
You know, reading someone else's mail
is a felony.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.127
- So is stealing a moose.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.842
It's from my old foster sister.

43:57.426 --> 43:59.136
She's a few years older than me and...

44:00.095 --> 44:01.221
that's just something she does.

44:01.305 --> 44:05.100
She sends me these postcards
with stupid jokes.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.061
And I love them.

44:08.604 --> 44:09.897
I didn't know you were a foster kid.

44:10.898 --> 44:11.899
Yeah.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.568
Is that something
you like to just keep to yourself?

44:15.694 --> 44:18.113
No, I'm not, like, embarrassed about it.

44:19.406 --> 44:21.450
I just never heard you talk
about it before.

44:22.201 --> 44:23.202
Do your friends here know?

44:24.703 --> 44:25.704
They never asked.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.583
Sometimes...

44:31.335 --> 44:37.257
I just wanna feel so normal
that I'm almost boring.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.010
Yeah.

44:41.428 --> 44:42.596
I know what you mean.

45:04.910 --> 45:06.328
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.081
Shit, sorry, I thought Bree was here.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.291
Figured you'd be at Wrigley's.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.670
Yeah, well, you know,
sometimes I sleep better alone.

45:17.923 --> 45:19.091
Are we okay?

45:20.884 --> 45:22.344
Do you still like me?

45:22.970 --> 45:24.763
What... what do you mean?

45:25.681 --> 45:27.391
Of course, I still like you.

45:27.641 --> 45:30.436
I don't know, it just feels weird.
It feels like you've been really weird

45:30.602 --> 45:34.523
- with me lately and I don't know why.
- Come, come... come here.

45:41.905 --> 45:42.906
Look,

45:43.574 --> 45:45.617
it doesn't have anything
to do with you.

45:46.285 --> 45:49.580
Okay? Like, I... I love you,
you're one of my best friends.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.206
Really?

45:51.749 --> 45:55.127
- Yeah, of course, come on.
- Fuck.

45:55.502 --> 45:57.629
I'm sorry, I don't fucking know
what's happening to me.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.006
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.759
- Hey, you guys okay?
- I'm not really sure.

46:02.634 --> 46:04.052
- What happened?
- I don't know.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.513
I really don't know,
I just feel... I just don't...

46:07.765 --> 46:09.099
feel good. I feel like...

46:12.102 --> 46:13.604
I don't know, I don't know,

46:13.604 --> 46:14.688
- I don't know.
- About what?

46:14.772 --> 46:16.023
Just shit with Stephen,

46:16.023 --> 46:18.984
like, I've... I'm being so stupid,
I don't even feel like myself.

46:18.984 --> 46:21.195
I feel like,
I'm... I'm actually going crazy.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.863
Wh... why, why, what happened?

46:25.657 --> 46:27.659
I feel like he's fucking other people.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.163
But didn't...

46:32.247 --> 46:33.832
didn't you guys kind of agree
that you could?

46:34.166 --> 46:37.336
Yeah, yeah, apparently, we did.
I don't fucking know,

46:37.336 --> 46:41.089
my God. I feel like, I'm losing it.
I actually feel like I'm... I'm losing it,

46:41.173 --> 46:42.216
- like, I'm going crazy.
- Hey.

46:42.216 --> 46:46.970
You know, you can do a lot better, right?
It's not like he has some magic penis.

46:47.095 --> 46:48.722
How do you know it's not magic?

46:51.266 --> 46:52.810
No, she's right though, like...

46:53.769 --> 46:55.103
there are other people out there.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.439
What about that guy, that...
that we met in the alley?

46:57.523 --> 47:01.235
- Max. Yeah.
- Yeah. You liked him.

47:02.319 --> 47:06.490
Yeah. He's cool. Okay, it's fine,
I'm... I'm... good, seriously.

47:06.907 --> 47:10.494
How... how are you doing? Did you...
did you go see Tim last night?

47:11.787 --> 47:13.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

47:15.374 --> 47:16.917
I don't think I'm into him anymore.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.379
I don't know, like, the sex is...

47:21.922 --> 47:22.923
Eh.

47:24.466 --> 47:26.343
Wow, okay, look at this virgin.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.846
She has sex one time,
and she already has standards.

47:39.982 --> 47:40.983
Hi.

47:42.818 --> 47:43.819
What can I get you?

47:44.695 --> 47:45.904
Um...

47:46.905 --> 47:48.240
Just some water.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.994
Fuck! You're one
of those demanding customers.

47:54.037 --> 47:57.958
Hey, I'm sorry I flaked before,
school's been very crazy.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.252
Mm. School...

48:01.420 --> 48:02.921
Um, but I was thinking...

48:04.423 --> 48:07.259
You still wanna grab dinner sometime?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.513
Just nobody's fed me since you,

48:11.597 --> 48:14.266
I'm honestly
just getting really fucking hungry.

48:16.602 --> 48:17.811
Uh...

48:19.021 --> 48:20.564
No, sorry.

48:21.815 --> 48:23.025
I think that ship sailed.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.032
Yeah, uh...

48:31.658 --> 48:32.701
I'm fucking with you.

48:33.410 --> 48:34.411
Let's get dinner.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.373
I'll get you that water.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.376
Fucking blew it.

48:42.002 --> 48:45.255
I... I misread the whole thing,
I crossed the line

48:45.339 --> 48:48.133
without realizing it was there.
And then I couldn't fucking...

48:49.468 --> 48:50.552
find my way back.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.013
Okay. So...

48:54.056 --> 48:55.474
you're not gonna get the internship.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.518
You have to let it go
and move on to the next thing.

49:08.111 --> 49:11.031
- We'll make a list of other internships.
- Yeah. I...

49:12.658 --> 49:16.119
- I... I need to figure this out.
- I know.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.413
We will.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.334
This is just a temporary setback.

49:25.253 --> 49:26.254
Yeah.

49:28.590 --> 49:29.591
Okay.

50:15.804 --> 50:16.805
Hi.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.265
What's going on?

50:21.601 --> 50:22.728
Sorry we fought.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.317
I'm sorry, too.
