07:58.740 --> 08:01.812

four years to buy a flat.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.697
Good decisions need time.

08:03.780 --> 08:06.169
Three months on,
you're back at your mam's,

08:06.260 --> 08:09.058
Tamsin owns the flat
and she's moved her brother in.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.700
She just needs thinking time.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.613
- lt is her brother.
- Fuck off! He's black!

08:41.740 --> 08:44.538
Sorry, Yvonne.
l thought someone was following.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.009
- You're picking that up.
- Yeah, l will.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.331
- Exactly as it was before.
- l will.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.412
And while you're down there,
you can dust the tins!

08:57.900 --> 09:00.698
Just watch the door...

09:00.780 --> 09:03.772
lt doesn't make sense.
Why did it take three years

09:03.860 --> 09:07.375
- for the creditors to catch up?
- We did a moonlit flit last time.

09:07.460 --> 09:11.055
A night l'll never forget.
Kids this high carrying furniture.

09:11.140 --> 09:14.337
Couldn't tell what Frank said.
We thought they were Bosnians.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.617
- After a week we wished they were.
- Nothing for three years,

09:17.700 --> 09:19.611
then everybody finds out at once.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.578
Steve's right.
Plus, Dad was looking for a letter.

09:22.660 --> 09:25.333
- Meaning?
- He were in top form. Why?

09:25.420 --> 09:28.969
- What was he waiting for?
- He only gets his giro here.

09:29.060 --> 09:32.097
All the bills were for
Vernon Francis Gallagher.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.740
l reckon he's broke the rules.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.811
He's used his full name somewhere.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.368
(Doorbell ringing)

09:39.460 --> 09:42.770
You go, Veronica.
lf it's a bailiff, say l'm out.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.416
Hello, Frank.

10:51.220 --> 10:52.733
(Doors thud)

10:52.820 --> 10:56.654
Hey, Frank, while you're down there,
can you just mop that sick up?

Nope.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.489
- Liam.
- Get away! Liam Gallagher!

11:16.580 --> 11:19.811
You're never gonna live
that name down, son.

11:22.580 --> 11:27.290
- You wee tinker. So, where's your dad?
- He doesn't live here.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.053
This house has six to eight berths.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.608
People on my list need houses this size.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.533
So if all the berths aren't in use,
you're out.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.373
Plus...there's me.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.816
- Who are you?
- l'm Frank's eldest, Stevie.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.609
- So, Frank's...
- Still in lraq.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.453
- Come again?
- He joined the army.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.896
l know you're pulling my leg,
cos l was on the phone to Frank.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.335
We had an appointment here.

11:54.420 --> 11:59.414
Never kid a kidder.
l don't like being lied to.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.576
Start again?

12:02.660 --> 12:04.890
lt's four bedrooms or five here?

12:04.980 --> 12:06.891
Four. Why?

12:06.980 --> 12:11.292
Request from the Child Support Agency
for a domestic circumstances appraisal.

12:11.380 --> 12:15.134
- Ha! Their phrase, not mine.
- Hang on!

12:15.220 --> 12:18.451
What's any of this got to do with
the Child Support Agency?

12:18.540 --> 12:21.771
Presumably because
your mum asked for a summary.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.169
Mum?

12:30.740 --> 12:33.015
Do you know where she is?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.650
Don't you?

12:39.220 --> 12:42.929
So who filed the claim against her,
if your dad's not living here?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.256
What have you done?

13:03.620 --> 13:05.975
Do us a favour.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.291
Ring this number.
Find out if Monica's there.

13:09.380 --> 13:13.976
lf she is, then tell her
congratulations, she's won.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.857
Who's Monica?

13:15.940 --> 13:18.329
- Doesn't matter!
- Won what?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.729
You know, whatever. Lottery.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.539
- Teddy bear!
- For what?

13:23.620 --> 13:25.576
Just do as your told and make the call!

13:26.980 --> 13:29.130
Just...a teddy bear.

13:29.220 --> 13:30.972
Massive!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.335
Just say that!

13:34.700 --> 13:38.329
l hope Monica, whoever she is,
worked very hard for it.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.736
What the...?

13:50.460 --> 13:52.416
Hey... Hey...

13:52.500 --> 13:54.411
Come on.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.617
What, you think
l'm going around chasing skirt?

13:57.700 --> 14:01.613
Give over, Sheila. A bloke couldn't love
anybody more than l love you.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.376
She's not really won a teddy.

14:12.020 --> 14:16.377
And if l was giving away a teddy,
you'd be absolutely top of the list.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.370
l'll let you give us one
with the biggest in the box.

14:25.780 --> 14:28.055
Are you sure you're ready for that?

14:29.380 --> 14:34.215
Yeah, just give us a couple of aspirin,
get it over and done with.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.734
Then you ring Monica.

14:37.780 --> 14:39.736
Yeah?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.256
Michael, over.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.736
Anything your end, George?

15:06.820 --> 15:09.380
'Over.'

15:09.460 --> 15:12.020
'Nothing, Michael. Over.'

15:12.100 --> 15:13.658
(Electronic beeping)

15:13.740 --> 15:16.129
This'll be ready in a sec. Over.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.776
'Am l coming over? Over.'

15:20.860 --> 15:22.816
Yeah. Come over.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.652
Over.

15:42.260 --> 15:44.216
Oh, hello!

16:05.180 --> 16:08.013
- ls he not in here?
- Daren't go home.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.809
Which is great for the till,
so don't go cheering him up.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.936
(Fruit machines playing tunes)

16:22.900 --> 16:24.538
- You know where Mum is.
- No.

16:24.620 --> 16:29.535
Liar. We've had the housing officer
round. You filed a claim against her.

16:29.620 --> 16:33.249
They know where she is.
They won't give us the address.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.854
We have got bailiffs
front and back cos of you.

16:37.940 --> 16:42.297
''Cos of me''! No one blames your mam,
no one has a go at that gutless bitch.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.416
Bloody right l've made a claim!

16:45.700 --> 16:47.656
The pain she's caused me.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.857
The shit Monica's loaded on me.
She's living it up

16:50.940 --> 16:54.774
with a bloke in Moston and l'm fetching
up six kids on fucking peanuts!

16:54.860 --> 16:58.489
You are not bringing up six kids.
You never brought up six kids. l am!

16:58.580 --> 17:02.129
lf there's any money coming,
it's owed to me.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.050
How do you know she's in Moston?

17:05.339 --> 17:08.137
Jackie Peasgood gave me her number.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.250
That's how the CSA traced her.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.296
lt's a Moston code.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.697
- Have you talked to her?
- Have l fuck.

17:29.780 --> 17:33.853
lf she finds out l'm on to her,
we won't see her for dust, will we?

17:33.940 --> 17:35.896
l want to see that money...

17:38.380 --> 17:43.932
- What?
- She thinks she's won a teddy.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.976
Monica?

17:47.180 --> 17:50.172
Oh, hello. lt's Sheila here.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.694
From Costchopper, the mini-market.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.849
l'm delighted to announce
you've won the raffle.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.616
lt's a teddy bear.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.937
First prize.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.976
Biggest teddy there is.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.049
l know.

18:14.780 --> 18:16.896
l've never won anything either.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.935
l bet you're thrilled, aren't you?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.976
l'm thrilled for you.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.689
Anyway, prize-giving's at six o'clock.

18:28.020 --> 18:31.092
Carol Vorderman's making
the presentation.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.136
She doesn't know who Carol is.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.052
How could you not know
who Carol Vorderman is?

18:38.140 --> 18:39.368
(Mouths)

18:39.460 --> 18:41.416
Anyway, it's six on the dot.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.976
Richard Whiteley might be there and all.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.016
Bye, Monica.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.894
She's never heard of Richard Whiteley.

18:52.980 --> 18:55.574
- ls she coming?
- Richard Whiteley!

18:55.660 --> 18:57.969
Did she say
she was picking up the prize?

18:58.060 --> 19:00.938
Yes, big daft moo.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.816
How do you know her, anyway?

19:06.860 --> 19:10.569
lf she shows her face, l'll follow her
exactly to where she's hiding.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.935
We need you home
when Wilson comes back.

19:13.020 --> 19:15.215
When's he offering?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.450
Tomorrow. Eleven o'clock.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.691
- l'll see if l can make it.
- You will not see if you can!

19:20.780 --> 19:24.011
You will bloody well be there
and sort this out!

19:26.540 --> 19:28.531
(Door slams)

19:28.620 --> 19:29.575
Ready, Frank?

20:12.260 --> 20:14.216
Monica...

20:24.540 --> 20:26.496
Monica?

20:33.620 --> 20:35.815
What kind of money are we talking?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.413
Seven grand so far.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.968
- Christ. Where did he spend it?
- Not the house.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.812
- Not clothes.
- Not food.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.609
Here we go. One of
the original labour-saving devices,

20:45.700 --> 20:48.339
beaten only by the vibrator!

20:48.420 --> 20:51.378
- Veronica!
- What? They all know what a vibrator is.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.691
That may be, but it's not for discussion
in an open house.

20:54.780 --> 20:58.011
Oh, grow up!
Right, if it dries up, just gob on it.

21:00.140 --> 21:02.051
- See?
- Eugh!

21:02.140 --> 21:04.096
Right, kids, what am l doing?

21:33.740 --> 21:35.696
(Sobbing)

21:37.380 --> 21:40.850
Look at the state of her!
Your idea of a joke?

21:40.940 --> 21:44.137
Cos you're scared of women
with opinions, eh?

21:44.220 --> 21:47.895
Well, watch this space, crinkle dick.

21:47.980 --> 21:51.973
l'll show you what's funny
when l rip the face off your fucking head!

21:52.060 --> 21:54.574
You twisted fascist old shit!

22:03.900 --> 22:06.733
- Are you sure you got the right shop?
- Yeah.

22:06.820 --> 22:09.698
l'm asking you to think.
Did they say Costchopper?

22:09.780 --> 22:13.853
Yeah! l wrote it down.
l wrote everything down.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.215
Stop talking to me like l'm stupid.

22:25.180 --> 22:26.533
Frank?

22:26.620 --> 22:29.657
- What?
- lt's Frank!

22:34.340 --> 22:35.898
Frank!

22:50.100 --> 22:53.649
- Did you see the missus?
- She's seen me! Come on, come on!

22:53.740 --> 22:56.095
- Who's the other bird?
- Her bloke!

22:56.180 --> 22:59.172
- A truck driver! What's that all about?
- Eh?

22:59.260 --> 23:01.933
Come on, floor it, Kev, or we're done for.

23:02.020 --> 23:05.899
(ln distance) Come here!
l'll get you, you bastard!

23:13.140 --> 23:15.654
(Horn blaring)

23:17.220 --> 23:19.131
(Horn blaring)

23:20.180 --> 23:22.614
Come on!
Faster than this, you gormless dick!

23:22.700 --> 23:26.932
l can't go faster. Why the hell
didn't you say she was a lezzer?

23:27.020 --> 23:30.330
lf l'd have known, l'd have asked her
back, wouldn't l?

23:30.420 --> 23:32.411
(Horn blaring)

23:33.260 --> 23:35.535
(Horn blaring)

23:35.620 --> 23:37.338
Next exit, Kev!

23:37.420 --> 23:40.014
(Horn blaring)

23:42.500 --> 23:44.456
Come on!

23:51.420 --> 23:53.536
(Tyres screeching)

23:54.940 --> 23:59.855
What did l say? Milk and egg, mixed by
whisk, coat very gently, it'll always crisp.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.899
- lt smells fantastic, Sheila.
- Thanks to you, the new Delia.

24:03.980 --> 24:07.495
Actually, l've lost patience with Delia
since the new haircut.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.572
lt's too severe.
Plus she never writes back.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.851
(Screams)

24:14.940 --> 24:17.056
- What?
- What about the bloody car?

24:17.140 --> 24:20.928
Oh, for Chr... Get it shifted,
you dateless ginger nonce!

24:21.020 --> 24:24.410
You're crossing the line.
Ginger's all l've got left of me dad,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.492
- so l'm warning you!
- (Truck approaching)

24:49.980 --> 24:51.936
(Clatter)

24:53.180 --> 24:55.171
Sheila! Where's the back door key?

24:55.260 --> 24:59.219
l'm trying to concentrate a little bit here,
Frank, thank you.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.696
Mum...

25:03.940 --> 25:04.895
Mum?

25:25.540 --> 25:27.371
Debbie?

25:53.340 --> 25:56.935
- lt's nowt to do with me. l'm the driver.
- That's driving? Huh!

25:57.020 --> 26:00.137
l've got to get back to work.
l said l'd only be half an hour.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.575
Plenty of other jobs.

26:05.820 --> 26:10.450
That were a filthy bloody trick.
l had me heart set on that teddy.

26:10.540 --> 26:15.250
Oh! ''Teddy'' is it? ''Heart set'', is it?
So, what about your kids?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.013
Your six kids,
youngest being four months old

26:18.100 --> 26:20.694
when you ran off with fucking Shrek.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.294
- Am l answering that, Monica?
- No.

26:24.260 --> 26:26.615
l didn't leave you, Frank.

26:26.700 --> 26:30.693
- You bloody did! You pissed off!
- l didn't leave me family!

26:30.780 --> 26:32.736
You'd done your worst to destroy me!

26:32.820 --> 26:35.653
When l got to Norma's that night,
l was like a bloody...

26:35.740 --> 26:38.493
- Emotional cripple.
- ..total emotional cripple

26:38.580 --> 26:40.491
with not one iota of self-respect.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.969
You drove me into the ground!

26:43.060 --> 26:46.097
You'd rob me
of any dignity l ever had and...

26:49.860 --> 26:52.055
Where's the rest of the kids?

26:52.140 --> 26:54.449
- They live down Fiona's.
- Playing out.

27:08.180 --> 27:10.330
- George. Over.
- 'Michael. Over.'

27:10.420 --> 27:12.376
- Oi!
- Sit down, mate.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.936
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

27:26.340 --> 27:28.251
Debbie!

27:51.940 --> 27:53.896
What's up, sweetheart?

27:54.980 --> 27:56.936
Did he have one too many?

27:58.180 --> 28:00.296
Just ignore him.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.575
Why do you always blame Dad first?

28:13.020 --> 28:15.375
Hey!

28:15.460 --> 28:17.416
Come on!

28:18.980 --> 28:21.210
l'm going round Sheila's.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.336
Mum's round there.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.815
Oh, Christ, Fiona. Come here.

28:43.300 --> 28:46.212
- ls this...? ls this a good idea?
- l dunno.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.256
lt wasn't mine, was it?

28:48.340 --> 28:51.013
She just rolled up,
scared the shit out of Debbie.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.410
Listen... Listen...

28:59.180 --> 29:01.740
- l know how you're feeling.
- No, you...

29:02.900 --> 29:04.856
You can't...

29:06.340 --> 29:08.296
What if you just go round?

29:08.380 --> 29:10.735
l'll come with you.

29:11.780 --> 29:14.010
Look at their faces, for fuck's sakes.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.173
- l'll go with you.
- We both will, won't we?

29:21.340 --> 29:25.731
Wrong, Carl, cos l am
not...fucking...coming!

29:30.860 --> 29:33.249
- You abused her.
- She asked me to!

29:33.340 --> 29:36.298
- Walloping her?
- What?

29:37.420 --> 29:38.933
- When?
- Frank, you never!

29:39.020 --> 29:41.409
- Fuck off! When?
- That May Bank Holiday.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.014
You hit me
with a pan of fucking porridge!

29:44.100 --> 29:47.456
- You hit me back!
- Queensberry rules. You broke my nose!

29:47.540 --> 29:50.896
l looked like Ann fucking Widdecombe!
You started it, mad bitch!

29:50.980 --> 29:53.210
l'll finish it if you lay a finger on her!

29:53.300 --> 29:55.814
Norma, we're both just third parties here.

29:55.900 --> 30:00.291
Why don't we both just duck out and
leave Monica to make her apologies?

30:00.380 --> 30:04.612
- For walking out on this piece of shit?
- Not particularly.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.656
Walking out on them.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.891
Oh, my God...

30:12.980 --> 30:16.768
lt's all right, l'm not one of yours.
Just came for a look.

30:16.860 --> 30:19.294
Oh, Kev!

30:26.700 --> 30:28.656
Come on, let us in.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.653
l know you don't need anybody,
Debs, but...

30:38.620 --> 30:40.576
What if l do?

30:47.380 --> 30:49.575
(Door opens)

31:11.220 --> 31:13.176
(TV in background)

31:17.060 --> 31:21.133
'..all of the female genitalia,
the most severe form of circumcision.'

31:25.540 --> 31:27.531
Monica's...

31:31.900 --> 31:34.460
She looks absolutely beautiful.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.576
l miss her.

32:02.340 --> 32:05.491
l'll have paid this house off
by the time l'm 54.

32:05.580 --> 32:08.299
We put down a big deposit.

32:11.420 --> 32:13.331
You use love eggs?

32:13.420 --> 32:15.536
Not so much these days,
not since Frank.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.534
My mum had a pair
before they were fashionable.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.930
l remember thinking,
Easter's a long way off.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.176
What the fuck are you on, Sheila?

32:27.260 --> 32:29.216
Oh, God, now you're asking!

32:29.300 --> 32:30.653
Erm...

32:30.740 --> 32:32.696
Seroxin, 350 milligrams.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.736
Breakfast and teatime.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.654
Dipipanol, 25s, three times daily.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.856
Er, Praxil, 200s.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.896
No, l tell a lie, it's 400s.

32:42.980 --> 32:46.609
Come Monday, just breakfasts.
And, erm...

32:46.700 --> 32:49.851
Carbomazepan,
whenever l manage to take them.

33:38.380 --> 33:42.976
Frank, you're scaring the dogs. Saying
that, scaring them is an improvement.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.857
Save you a bob or two.

- Do l nip upstairs and look?
- Single.

35:10.980 --> 35:13.050
We chucked the double out when...

35:14.740 --> 35:17.208
Wait, stop, right there.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.575
l am way out of my league.

35:19.660 --> 35:22.970
Billy, Mr Wilson,
don't do that, cos Dad's right.

35:23.060 --> 35:26.336
They made me do this.
l've got to avoid people, you see.

35:26.420 --> 35:29.218
You're avoiding them, Frank?
ls that right?

35:29.300 --> 35:31.052
How long have l been doing this job?

35:31.140 --> 35:34.735
l'm not a scaredy-cat. l housed
your mum when she was on parole.

35:34.820 --> 35:37.732
Nobody else would touch her.
You were a teenager.

35:37.820 --> 35:40.698
l've done nothing but favours.

35:40.780 --> 35:43.374
But now you've had it.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.056
That's your copy of the report.

35:47.140 --> 35:52.009
Good luck with the CSA claim. Cos when
you get it, l want two grand off you.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.251
What... What for, for fuck's sake?

35:55.340 --> 35:58.776
Rent arrears from your last address
in your other name.

35:58.860 --> 36:03.058
Don't think you'll get away with it,
cos l'll haunt you till the day you die

36:03.140 --> 36:05.017
for every last penny,

36:05.100 --> 36:07.091
madam.

36:07.180 --> 36:09.057
Aaargh!

36:09.140 --> 36:13.452
- What did you do that for?
- Mr Wilson, are you OK?

36:13.540 --> 36:17.692
That's all you can do! He'll do you
for assault now, you gormless prick!

36:17.780 --> 36:19.896
He started it!

36:21.180 --> 36:23.455
Get some ice or something.

36:23.540 --> 36:27.374
Keep your head back
in case it's bleeding.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.976
l try...

36:49.780 --> 36:51.736
l blow it.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.932
That's why l don't go to church
any more!

36:59.580 --> 37:01.696
Wife's gone walkabout, George.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.850
She's looking a bit knocked about. Over.

37:03.940 --> 37:08.172
- Rough as arseholes, actually. Over.
- 'Ta, Michael.'

37:09.580 --> 37:14.017
'Bloke from Housing's just come out
with busted nose! Over.'

37:14.100 --> 37:16.056
He must be in there.

37:16.140 --> 37:18.210
Go, go, go! l'll talk to the missus.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.052
Over!

38:08.460 --> 38:10.894
ls anyone around here normal?

38:10.980 --> 38:13.210
Frank!

38:26.620 --> 38:29.817
You think you're clever, Frank?
You reckon this is clever?

38:29.900 --> 38:31.856
Oof!

38:33.700 --> 38:35.656
Steady on, Michael!

38:37.900 --> 38:41.654
Do you know what your new name is,
Frank? You know what people call you?

38:41.740 --> 38:47.372
Dead Man Walking. When you change
into your nightie, just sleep on this...

38:50.620 --> 38:53.612
Do you want one?
Then clear it up and fuck off!

38:58.580 --> 39:00.536
You and all!

39:01.820 --> 39:02.775
Men, eh?

39:04.935 --> 39:07.688
There you are, mate. £2.30.

39:07.775 --> 39:09.731
Ta.

39:17.295 --> 39:19.809
l'm not in t'market for business, love.

39:20.975 --> 39:24.490
Who's fucking asking?
Only wanted a light.

39:24.575 --> 39:26.531
(Veronica giggles)

39:26.615 --> 39:28.253
Sorry.

39:30.695 --> 39:32.651
lt's just that, well...

39:32.735 --> 39:36.933
Today's been a bit, you know, new job.

39:37.015 --> 39:38.926
Trying to get used to it.

39:39.015 --> 39:41.893
Oh... Who'd you work for?

39:41.975 --> 39:44.808
- TlC security.
- Ooh...

39:44.895 --> 39:46.806
l know, l'm not proud of it, but...

39:46.895 --> 39:52.765
Lost me job. l've got three kids.
And a new mortgage.

39:52.855 --> 39:55.289
l love kids, me. And l love mortgages.

39:56.455 --> 39:58.810
- But in that order!
(Both chuckle)

40:02.255 --> 40:03.927
So, what have you got, then?

40:04.015 --> 40:08.452
Right, well, l've got an endowment, a
repayment, and the new one's a tracker.

40:08.535 --> 40:10.366
Tracker? How does that work?

40:10.455 --> 40:13.447
- Goes up and down with interest rates.
- Does it?

40:13.535 --> 40:16.971
- You'll have to tell me about that one.
- l'll get you a leaflet.

40:23.215 --> 40:25.206
(Doorbell ringing)

40:32.095 --> 40:35.132
- Come on, darling, have some tea.
- l'm not very hungry.

40:50.055 --> 40:53.650
- Nice and clean.
- lan and Carl.

40:53.735 --> 40:55.453
You've done well here.

40:55.535 --> 40:57.571
Thanks.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.374
lt's bigger than mine, and l'm working.

41:01.455 --> 41:03.286
Oh, look!

41:03.375 --> 41:07.368
Remember Barbara?
Mum's sister, Barbara.

41:07.455 --> 41:10.845
l told you about her.
Married to the John with no eyebrows.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.733
Barbara gave me this
as part of my wedding present.

41:13.815 --> 41:16.613
Other part being what?

41:37.015 --> 41:40.132
- When did you last see the car?
- lt was parked outside.

41:40.215 --> 41:43.412
- When did you last have the keys?
- ln here. ln me pocket.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.451
ln here?

41:45.535 --> 41:48.652
All right, who's the smartarse?

41:50.095 --> 41:52.006
l'll count to five.

41:52.095 --> 41:54.051
Five!

41:54.135 --> 41:57.207
Four, three, two, one!

41:57.295 --> 42:00.048
Waste of fucking space! Phone a taxi!

42:00.135 --> 42:02.091
Phone was in the car.

42:02.175 --> 42:03.972
- Get out!
- (Jeering)

42:26.095 --> 42:30.646
Look, l know what you all think of me,
but if l have to start apologising,

42:30.735 --> 42:35.525
l'll be undoing a lot of good therapy that
Norma's been kind enough to pay for.

42:35.615 --> 42:37.651
Thank you, Norma.

42:43.455 --> 42:46.413
- You got kids, Norma?
- Not yet.

42:46.495 --> 42:48.611
- You got a problem with that?
- Norma...

42:48.695 --> 42:52.290
l'm working out which of you
came up with the idea of her vanishing.

42:53.175 --> 42:55.325
Mum, doing a disappearing act.

42:55.415 --> 42:59.294
Liam wasn't desperate,
cos he was only three months old.

43:00.375 --> 43:04.926
Debbie was.
Carl was, lan was, Lip was. l was.

43:05.015 --> 43:07.483
We thought you were dead.

43:10.775 --> 43:12.845
l'm a lesbian, Fiona.

43:12.935 --> 43:14.607
ls she?

43:14.695 --> 43:17.926
How was l meant to come back
and tell you that?

43:18.015 --> 43:22.770
- Gently? ln stages, or never.
- So, is she?

43:22.855 --> 43:25.653
Your mum's been through
hell and high water, Fiona.

43:25.735 --> 43:27.612
You better believe it, girl.

43:27.695 --> 43:31.529
You could have popped in to mention
you were alive. Might have helped.

43:31.615 --> 43:35.085
- (Norma) You weren't.
- l wasn't alive, Fiona.

43:35.175 --> 43:37.325
Not till l met Norma.

43:38.655 --> 43:44.924
Look, l swear to you, Fiona, l stuck it
in my diary to ring you next week.

43:45.015 --> 43:48.052
For your 21 st, to say hello and well done.

43:48.135 --> 43:50.444
- What good's that?
- She's done a great job.

43:50.535 --> 43:53.447
Look at you all! l swear to you, Lip,

43:53.535 --> 43:57.084
to you all, l'd never have left
if l didn't think Fiona could cope.

43:57.175 --> 44:01.726
l taught her all she knows. She ran rings
round your dad before she was seven.

44:01.815 --> 44:04.807
l knew you'd be safe.
Well, you could, couldn't you?

44:04.895 --> 44:08.046
l mean, it's not like
l left anybody in a mess.

44:08.135 --> 44:10.046
l knew Fiona could cope.

44:14.415 --> 44:17.964
Lip, lan, tell her
how many GCSEs you're doing.

44:18.055 --> 44:21.252
- l'm doing ten.
- Seven or eight, l'm not too sure yet.

44:21.335 --> 44:23.371
Debbie, prizes this year.

44:23.455 --> 44:25.810
English, maths, chemistry, and neatness.

44:25.895 --> 44:28.932
Carl, you tell her what you built
when you went to Swindon.

44:29.015 --> 44:32.166
Triple-cushion,
double-aerofoil streamline hovercraft.

44:32.255 --> 44:34.689
- Went like a bomb.
- Hovercraft, to you.

44:34.775 --> 44:38.848
- Why was he in Swindon?
- Two-week residential speech therapy.

44:38.935 --> 44:41.244
Took me a year
to get him a place, but l did it.

44:41.335 --> 44:42.893
Yeah, l coped. Thanks!

44:42.975 --> 44:45.569
No thanks, not to you.

44:45.655 --> 44:49.170
lf anybody could change your dad,
she could, l knew that.

44:49.255 --> 44:51.211
He hasn't changed! How's he changed?

44:51.295 --> 44:54.651
- Well, he's a lot cleaner.
- He's as much help as you've been.

44:54.735 --> 44:56.691
We're better off without both of you.

44:56.775 --> 45:01.326
You couldn't have known that when you
fucked off, could you? You didn't know.

45:01.415 --> 45:04.134
You never bothered finding out!

45:04.215 --> 45:07.093
(Beeping)

45:07.175 --> 45:09.848
l told you l'd get all the blame, didn't l?

45:09.935 --> 45:14.008
l talked to loads of people,
and l heard how you were getting on.

45:14.095 --> 45:17.770
- Big fucking deal!
- l'm not happy with underage swearing!

45:17.855 --> 45:22.292
That's fine, Norma, cos l'm fucking off
anyway. l am proud of every one of them.

45:22.375 --> 45:25.287
And l am proud of me, for pulling it off!

45:25.375 --> 45:27.331
But they're your kids.

45:27.415 --> 45:29.451
So you take over from here.

45:29.535 --> 45:34.655
Housing Office, bailiffs, schools, clinic.

45:34.735 --> 45:36.771
Over to you, Mum!

45:57.455 --> 46:00.572
