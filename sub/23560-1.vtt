(Dog barks)

03:25.876 --> 03:27.909
(Running footsteps)

04:06.751 --> 04:08.284
William.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.659
(Door creaks)

04:30.751 --> 04:32.284
Anna!

04:44.292 --> 04:47.451
(Pants and groans)

04:52.901 --> 04:55.101
(Gasps)

04:55.201 --> 04:59.209
Don't! You're standing on his face!

05:29.334 --> 05:31.367
(Train engine in the distance)

06:20.209 --> 06:21.909
You can walk.

06:26.209 --> 06:28.451
I'm going to telephone.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.451
Can you walk?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.701
Yes, I'm... I'm afraid so. Thank you.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.076
Were you driving?

08:05.834 --> 08:07.492
Don't worry.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.242
(Footsteps)

08:30.792 --> 08:32.326
Drink it.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.241
(Car engine)

08:56.959 --> 08:58.492
(Car door shuts)

09:09.917 --> 09:11.534
In there.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.442
Er, sit, sit down.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.742
No, it's... it's all right.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.234
Yours is the only house
for some distance.

09:31.334 --> 09:33.817
So he must've been coming to see you.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.359
He was.

09:35.459 --> 09:37.076
You were expecting?

09:37.709 --> 09:39.367
Yes.

09:42.876 --> 09:45.951
(Officer coughs)

09:55.626 --> 09:57.159
Sorry.

09:58.876 --> 10:00.659
Did you know him well?

10:02.751 --> 10:04.492
He was my pupil.

10:05.001 --> 10:07.617
He was your pupil at the university?

10:08.167 --> 10:09.701
Yes.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.242
He wanted to talk to me about something.

10:15.042 --> 10:16.742
You found...

10:18.667 --> 10:21.326
You found the car at 1:45am.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.859
He was going to a party
and then coming on to me.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.359
It looks as though he was pretty drunk.

10:27.459 --> 10:29.742
There was whisky all over the car.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.742
I don't know what it was all about.

10:34.959 --> 10:39.326
I mean, I-I don't know what he wanted
to t-t-t-talk to me about.

10:46.542 --> 10:49.867
He probably wanted my advice
about something.

11:00.417 --> 11:03.076
(Clock chimes)

11:09.167 --> 11:10.951
(Groans)

11:14.417 --> 11:16.451
(Pants)

11:22.834 --> 11:25.034
(Groans)

11:31.584 --> 11:34.201
(Pants and groans)

11:34.667 --> 11:36.326
Stephen: Don't!

11:37.001 --> 11:40.317
You... you haven't spoken to her?

11:40.417 --> 11:41.951
No.

11:43.876 --> 11:45.742
Just seen her?

11:46.251 --> 11:48.442
I've just seen her walking about.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.159
A little.

11:51.042 --> 11:53.567
And you like the... the look of her?

11:53.667 --> 11:56.201
Yes. I do.

11:57.042 --> 12:00.317
- What am I supposed to do about it?
- Nothing at all.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.776
Oh, good.

12:01.876 --> 12:04.867
I'd just like to know
what you think of her, that's all.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.567
You realise I'm... I'm her tutor?

12:09.667 --> 12:13.242
Naturally.
I also realise you're my tutor.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.109
And as her tutor her moral welfare
must be my first consideration.

12:17.209 --> 12:21.609
Ah! You mean that besides being
her tutor, you're also her protector?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.492
Move round so I can get out of here.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.817
You know, I mean, I refuse to encourage

12:26.917 --> 12:30.526
or countenance male lust

12:30.626 --> 12:33.692
as directed against
any of my women students.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.242
- Well said!
- Thank you.

12:40.251 --> 12:42.359
Anyway, what's her name, for god's sake?

12:42.459 --> 12:44.317
Hm? Her name? Her name?

12:44.417 --> 12:46.192
Oh, I remember her name.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.317
It's Anna Von graz und leoben.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.576
- German?
- Austrian.

12:54.042 --> 12:55.867
Well, come on! What do you think of her?

12:57.126 --> 12:58.526
I don't think.

12:58.626 --> 13:00.567
I thought thinking was your job.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.159
Well, not about that.

13:03.834 --> 13:06.659
You're not past it, are you? Already?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.367
(Goat bleats)

13:12.376 --> 13:14.534
(Clock chimes)

13:19.126 --> 13:20.909
It's her!

13:22.001 --> 13:25.159
- She's coming for her second tutorial.
- You didn't tell me.

13:30.251 --> 13:32.034
She's talking to the goat.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.659
They speak German.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.409
That'll keep you busy.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.951
Why don't you wait?

13:44.042 --> 13:47.367
I'll introduce you. Hm?

13:47.792 --> 13:50.201
No. Not now. Really.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.692
You intend to go it alone, do you?

13:55.792 --> 13:57.151
Uh-huh.

13:57.251 --> 13:59.742
- Without an introduction?
- That's right.

14:06.334 --> 14:08.701
Philosophy is a process of enquiry only.

14:09.876 --> 14:13.576
It doesn't attempt to find
specific answers to specific questions.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.867
(Door shuts)

14:53.959 --> 14:56.284
She loves her dad.

14:57.334 --> 14:59.659
She hasn't eaten anything today.

15:03.001 --> 15:04.784
- Hello, Ted.
- Hello.

15:07.501 --> 15:09.326
What has she eaten?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.117
Some milk pudding for lunch.

15:13.001 --> 15:14.692
That's all right.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.326
Hey, Clarissa, come on. Come on.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.826
And then what? There you are.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.484
How many moons has Jupiter got?

15:27.584 --> 15:29.409
I don't know.

15:29.876 --> 15:31.276
12.

15:31.376 --> 15:34.484
- How many moons?
- 12 moons.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.234
Yes.

15:36.334 --> 15:39.409
Do you want to get the book
about the elephants? Off you go.

15:43.584 --> 15:47.617
I've got a new, um... new pupil.

15:48.334 --> 15:49.951
Oh?

15:50.709 --> 15:54.242
- She's an Austrian Princess.
- Is she?

15:55.334 --> 15:57.159
How do you know she's a Princess?

15:58.501 --> 16:01.276
She's got a very long name.

16:01.376 --> 16:02.817
Has she got golden hair?

16:02.917 --> 16:05.692
Erm... no.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.742
- Then she's a fake.
- I've found it I think!

16:09.251 --> 16:12.776
She's very sunburnt. Down you get.

16:12.876 --> 16:15.067
Then she's definitely not a Princess.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.909
She is a Princess!

16:18.667 --> 16:20.859
I knew I'd found it.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.492
Come on.

16:24.001 --> 16:25.534
(Groans)

16:25.959 --> 16:27.484
Up you come, madam.

16:27.584 --> 16:28.984
You sit over here.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.901
There in the corner with me.
There we are.

16:32.001 --> 16:34.442
- Now, who's going to start?
- You start.

16:34.542 --> 16:35.984
All right. Where?

16:36.084 --> 16:37.442
Erm...

16:37.542 --> 16:39.026
There!

16:39.126 --> 16:41.526
Has she made advances to you?

16:41.626 --> 16:44.067
Oh, no. I'm too old.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.867
You're not too old for me.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.026
I know that. Now, come on.
Who's going to start?

16:50.126 --> 16:52.534
- Clarissa: Me?
- Ted: She can't read!

16:52.917 --> 16:54.534
And I'm not too old for you.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.284
Stephen: Well, write me an essay
on what the problem is.

17:06.041 --> 17:09.076
Or rather on what the problem
seems to you to be.

17:10.959 --> 17:12.909
Will you?

17:31.167 --> 17:33.367
(Clock chimes)

17:43.584 --> 17:45.784

18:19.501 --> 18:22.984
"A statistical analysis

"29.9% between two and four

18:40.042 --> 18:44.326
"And 0.1% during a lecture

18:47.126 --> 18:50.484
I am surprised to hear
that Aristotle is on the syllabus

in the state of Wisconsin.

"Bus driver found in student's bed."

19:09.376 --> 19:12.909
But was anyone found
in the bus driver's bed?

19:18.626 --> 19:22.067
Did you ever hear the story
of my predecessor provost Jones

19:22.167 --> 19:23.867
and the stepladder?

19:25.917 --> 19:27.617
It's a bizarre story.

19:31.251 --> 19:33.034
It'll amuse you.

19:35.084 --> 19:38.484
Provost Jones and his good lady
decided one day

19:38.584 --> 19:40.826
to buy a stepladder...

20:18.751 --> 20:20.576
William: Stephen!

20:23.001 --> 20:24.534
Hello.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.609
I didn't know that you two had met.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.201
- We have, haven't we?
- Uh-huh.

20:33.459 --> 20:34.984
William: Jump in.

20:35.084 --> 20:37.909
- Me?
- Come on. We're going up river.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.576
I...

23:15.584 --> 23:17.201
Stephen: Ow!

23:18.292 --> 23:20.492
(Laughs)

23:24.167 --> 23:26.367
(Bells toll)

23:29.751 --> 23:31.367
(Anna laughs)

24:04.834 --> 24:06.867
You look very dignified.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.026
I feel wet.

24:09.126 --> 24:11.401
- You don't look wet!
- I don't look wet?

24:11.501 --> 24:15.201
Nobody looked at you as though you
were wet. They thought you were normal.

24:16.376 --> 24:19.701
I'm getting old.
Don't you understand? Old.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.284
It's my muscles.

24:23.126 --> 24:25.151
The muscles.

24:25.251 --> 24:27.401
No judgment.

24:27.501 --> 24:31.567
No judgment of distance.
It's all gone. Vanished!

24:31.667 --> 24:34.034
William:
I thought 40 was the prime of life.

24:35.042 --> 24:37.067
I mean, i-i-wouldn't say you looked old.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.201
You've still got a pretty good figure.

24:40.376 --> 24:43.484
I tell you what, why don't you do
an hour's squash every morning?

24:43.584 --> 24:46.109
Do you the world of good.

24:46.209 --> 24:49.859
If you're gonna be a farmer,
why the hell are you reading philosophy?

24:49.959 --> 24:51.701
To talk to the cows.

24:52.209 --> 24:54.409
(Clock chimes)

25:08.501 --> 25:11.651
It's nice knowing you. Really, you know.

25:11.751 --> 25:14.784
You're not a bad fellow for...
A philosophy tutor.

25:16.167 --> 25:17.867
I haven't got many friends.

25:18.917 --> 25:21.617
- That's because you're an aristocrat.
- Oh?

25:22.542 --> 25:25.067
All aristocrats were made to be...

25:25.167 --> 25:26.576
- What?
- Killed.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.401
William: Of course. They're immortal.

25:30.501 --> 25:32.701
(Clock chimes)

25:39.167 --> 25:40.784
Do you like her?

25:42.209 --> 25:43.742
Yes.

25:45.959 --> 25:49.109
Why don't you bring her
to my house for the day?

25:49.209 --> 25:50.742
On Sunday.

25:51.959 --> 25:53.234
Great.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.776
- Come for lunch.
- Marvellous.

25:55.876 --> 25:57.784
- Well, shall I ask her?
- No.

25:58.376 --> 26:00.076
No, I will.

26:04.001 --> 26:05.992
This might interest you.

26:07.042 --> 26:09.826
It expresses a different
point of view altogether.

26:10.292 --> 26:12.242
By Charley hall. Do you know him?

26:13.376 --> 26:16.067
- Yes, I think...
- The archaeologist.

26:16.167 --> 26:19.701
- Yes, I've met him.
- He writes novels as well.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.784
And appears on the television.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.992
- Does he?
- A very versatile man.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.326
Read it. I don't think much of it
but you might.

26:31.917 --> 26:33.451
Here.

26:36.959 --> 26:38.492
Thanks.

26:40.209 --> 26:43.734
Would you like to come
to my house on Sunday for lunch?

26:43.834 --> 26:45.742
That would be lovely.

26:46.209 --> 26:48.776
You could meet my wife and the children.

26:48.876 --> 26:50.442
Yes.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.742
Perhaps William could bring you.

26:54.001 --> 26:55.909
Ah, yes!

27:03.792 --> 27:05.617
I'll ask him.

27:13.417 --> 27:15.617
(Children shouting outside)

27:40.251 --> 27:41.951
Hello.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.451
And how are you?

27:50.126 --> 27:51.659
All right.

27:56.001 --> 27:58.826
- What are they up to?
- Oh, they're all right.

28:00.876 --> 28:03.442
Have you had any rest
with all this racket?

28:03.542 --> 28:05.451
- Yes.
- Hm?

28:07.042 --> 28:09.442
I've asked some people over on Sunday.

28:09.542 --> 28:11.067
Is that all right, hm?

28:11.167 --> 28:14.076
- What people?
- Well, y-you know, William.

28:15.167 --> 28:16.609
Hm?

28:16.709 --> 28:20.617
Oh, and... this girl, Anna Von graz.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.526
- You know, that girl.
- The Princess?

28:24.626 --> 28:27.326
(Laughs) Yes.

28:31.959 --> 28:33.992
She's William's girlfriend.

28:34.834 --> 28:36.742
Well, what do you think?

28:37.501 --> 28:39.734
I'm not very good
at mixing with royalty.

28:39.834 --> 28:42.734
Well, she's not really a Princess.
Don't be so silly!

28:42.834 --> 28:44.534
I'm not silly!

28:45.751 --> 28:47.992
Just for lunch, that's all.

28:49.542 --> 28:51.659
I can easily put them off.

28:53.501 --> 28:55.034
Hm...

28:56.417 --> 28:57.951
What are you doing?

28:58.917 --> 29:01.867
- Putting on my dressing gown.
- Hm.

29:16.501 --> 29:17.984
(Bicycle bell)

29:18.084 --> 29:21.617
Ted! Clarissa! Tea time!

29:24.126 --> 29:26.742
(Imitates motorbike)

30:02.834 --> 30:04.484
Ted: Dad!

30:04.584 --> 30:07.534
- What are you doing up there?
- Playing.

30:09.251 --> 30:11.367
Come on. Come down, Tarzan.

30:12.584 --> 30:17.534
You get yourself into
the most impossible places.

30:19.626 --> 30:21.242
Come on, fly.

30:23.001 --> 30:25.692
(Whistles)

30:25.792 --> 30:27.992
(Clock chimes)

31:05.084 --> 31:06.992
Hello, Anna.

31:07.251 --> 31:09.567
- William here?
- He's inside!

31:09.667 --> 31:11.609
Clarissa: Anna!

31:11.709 --> 31:13.659
Yes, coming!

31:14.792 --> 31:17.034
What are you doing here?

31:17.667 --> 31:20.534
Just passing, so I thought I'd drop in.

31:21.542 --> 31:23.992
- Passing?
- Yeah, just passing.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.492
Just... erm... floating by.

31:28.501 --> 31:29.859
Hey!

31:29.959 --> 31:31.784
(Chuckles)

31:32.834 --> 31:34.576
Come on, Ted!

31:35.292 --> 31:36.951
Come on!

31:44.709 --> 31:46.576
Come on! Kick it!

31:48.209 --> 31:49.442
Fly, come on!

31:49.542 --> 31:51.409
(Dog barks)

31:55.001 --> 31:57.117
- Hello.
- Hello, William.

31:58.001 --> 32:00.742
- Charley's here.
- We know!

32:01.626 --> 32:04.367
- Is he staying for lunch?
- Of course.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.276
Mm.

32:07.376 --> 32:08.734
Water.

32:08.834 --> 32:10.742
Can I do anything?

32:22.792 --> 32:24.367
Hey!

32:42.334 --> 32:43.867
(Grunts)

32:48.084 --> 32:49.701
(Groans)

32:51.126 --> 32:53.201
What are you writing now?

32:54.626 --> 32:56.409
A novel.

32:59.126 --> 33:01.076
I'd like to write a novel.

33:01.501 --> 33:04.401
- You would, eh?
- But I can't.

33:04.501 --> 33:08.192
It's child's play.
All you need is a starting point.

33:08.292 --> 33:09.692
- Oh?
- Here, for instance.

33:09.792 --> 33:13.242
- William: Where?
- Here. On this lawn.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.492
What are we all up to?

33:18.167 --> 33:21.326
Clarissa:
We're going to granny's on Tuesday.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.817
Are you going for a long time?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.159
We're going for three weeks.

33:26.834 --> 33:28.984
Mummy's going to have a baby, you see.

33:29.084 --> 33:31.234
When you're going to have a baby,
you see,

33:31.334 --> 33:33.359
you've got to have lots of rest.

33:33.459 --> 33:35.201
Of course.

33:38.209 --> 33:42.159
Describe to me what we're all doing.

33:44.001 --> 33:46.034
Rosalind's lying down.

33:46.501 --> 33:48.409
Stephen's weeding the garden.

33:49.626 --> 33:51.451
Anna's making a Daisy chain.

33:52.376 --> 33:55.117
We're... having this conversation.

33:55.751 --> 33:59.492
Good. But then you could go further.

34:00.584 --> 34:02.534
Rosalind is pregnant.

34:04.001 --> 34:09.034
Stephen... is having an affair
with a girl at Oxford.

34:09.833 --> 34:13.317
He's reached the age where he can't
keep his hands off girls at Oxford.

34:13.417 --> 34:14.992
William: What?

34:15.417 --> 34:17.484
But he feels guilty, of course.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.609
So he makes up a story.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.609
What story?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.492
This story.

34:23.958 --> 34:25.742
What are you talking about?

34:26.333 --> 34:28.359
(Puffs) Oh!

34:28.458 --> 34:30.367
These flies are terrible.

34:30.958 --> 34:33.034
Flies? There aren't any flies!

34:35.083 --> 34:38.742
Charley: They're sicilian
horse flies from corsica.

34:41.751 --> 34:43.109
(Chuckles)

34:43.208 --> 34:45.442
Have you heard our conversation?

34:45.542 --> 34:47.409
Yes.

34:48.417 --> 34:49.951
Yes!

34:57.542 --> 34:58.984
Out!

34:59.084 --> 35:00.784
(Laughter)

35:01.917 --> 35:03.734
Hurry up!

35:03.834 --> 35:07.701
Charley: Right. Oh!

35:09.542 --> 35:11.284
Anna! That's mine!

35:13.959 --> 35:16.284
(Laughs)

35:18.917 --> 35:19.984
Ooh!

35:20.084 --> 35:22.992
(Laughter)

35:28.542 --> 35:30.576
Stephen: Your serve.

35:39.751 --> 35:41.109
Oh!

35:41.209 --> 35:43.034
(Laughter)

35:52.417 --> 35:54.451
- Fault!
- Oh, my god!

36:09.251 --> 36:11.317
<i>Limonada!</i>

36:11.417 --> 36:12.951
(Sighs)

36:14.751 --> 36:16.901
Stephen: Well, will you stay for supper?

36:17.001 --> 36:18.817
- Charley: Yes.
- William: Cheers.

36:18.917 --> 36:21.817
Stephen: We came to see rosalind,
and she's lying in a heap.

36:21.917 --> 36:24.109
- Charley: You what?
- She's lying in a heap!

36:24.209 --> 36:26.317
Charley: Thought you said
she was Uriah heep!

36:26.417 --> 36:28.284
She is, but she's lying in one too!

36:33.751 --> 36:35.567
What are you doing?

36:35.667 --> 36:37.451
Making tea.

36:38.667 --> 36:41.326
I've just asked them to stay for dinner.

36:42.709 --> 36:44.409
Dinner?

36:45.167 --> 36:47.817
No. Supper.

36:47.917 --> 36:49.576
Cold supper.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.992
Are they staying?

36:54.542 --> 36:56.159
I don't know.

36:56.584 --> 36:58.284
But I'll do it.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.826
I'll do the supper.

37:01.334 --> 37:02.867
Kettle.

37:16.376 --> 37:19.276
Have you any brothers or sisters?

37:19.376 --> 37:21.151
One sister.

37:21.251 --> 37:22.901
- Is she beautiful?
- Very.

37:23.001 --> 37:24.567
Come for a walk, hm?

37:24.667 --> 37:26.659
I'm so comfortable.

37:30.084 --> 37:32.284
(Aircraft overhead)

37:38.167 --> 37:40.201
It's so lovely here.

37:41.042 --> 37:42.659
Yes, it is.

37:47.459 --> 37:49.367
I think I'll go for a walk.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.826
I'll come too.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.659
(Music over indistinct dialogue)

38:38.709 --> 38:42.242
- Stephen: Are you fond of William?
- Why do you ask?

38:44.959 --> 38:47.367
Are there many dons like you?

38:50.959 --> 38:52.951
Certainly not.

39:21.667 --> 39:25.076
- Mind, there's a spider's web.
- It won't hurt me.

39:32.584 --> 39:34.784
(Bells toll)

39:50.126 --> 39:52.201
Shall we go back now?

39:54.542 --> 39:56.076
Yes.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.076
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

40:15.292 --> 40:16.817
How are you?

40:16.917 --> 40:18.284
Fine.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.984
How's Laura?

40:21.084 --> 40:22.617
Great.

40:24.709 --> 40:26.492
All right, you know.

40:30.709 --> 40:32.492
I don't know, really.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.034
I haven't seen her.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.992
I've been pretty busy, you know.
One thing and another.

40:41.376 --> 40:43.826
- You look terrible.
- Me?

40:45.376 --> 40:47.276
I feel wonderful.

40:47.376 --> 40:49.534
Well, this'll kill you.

40:51.292 --> 40:53.026
There.

40:53.126 --> 40:55.492
I know.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.242
Will you stay for supper?

41:05.917 --> 41:09.067
I'd love to,
but I don't know about William.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.034
He'll stay.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.192
Have you seen William?

41:28.292 --> 41:30.034
No.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.651
How are you getting on?

41:44.751 --> 41:46.534
Fine.

41:47.167 --> 41:49.076
What do you mean?

41:51.917 --> 41:54.242
What does rosalind think about it?

41:56.042 --> 41:58.534
What does rosalind think about what?

42:00.126 --> 42:03.109
- Have you seen Anna?
- Both: No.

42:03.209 --> 42:05.284
(Laughter)

42:06.709 --> 42:09.942
- You're staying for supper, aren't you?
- We ought to go.

42:10.042 --> 42:11.576
It's all arranged.

43:05.709 --> 43:07.617
(Dog barks)

43:12.376 --> 43:14.109
Where are the children?

43:14.209 --> 43:16.526
They're not back yet.
They went out to tea.

43:16.626 --> 43:18.367
I didn't know that.

43:18.876 --> 43:21.534
- How's the supper?
- Nearly there.

43:27.376 --> 43:29.909
Oh, I think it's nearly ten years.

43:34.917 --> 43:36.451
Whisky?

43:58.042 --> 43:59.659
(Sniffs)

44:07.876 --> 44:09.409
Cheers.

44:24.126 --> 44:26.284
Who made that soup?

44:27.167 --> 44:29.159
I didn't make any soup.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.942
Your wife.

44:33.042 --> 44:36.067
Your beautiful wife

44:36.167 --> 44:38.484
made that damn soup.

44:38.584 --> 44:40.701
It was beautiful soup!

44:42.501 --> 44:44.734
My wife is beautiful too,
isn't she, rosalind?

44:44.834 --> 44:46.409
Yes.

44:48.626 --> 44:51.234
She's as beautiful as that soup.

44:51.334 --> 44:55.234
She's rich and intelligent
and beautiful.

44:55.334 --> 44:58.159
And we have three kids.
Don't forget that.

44:58.876 --> 45:01.034
And she understands me and...

45:02.501 --> 45:04.034
And?

45:06.251 --> 45:11.276
And we're all old friends,
him and his wife and me and my wife.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.076
Don't forget that.

45:14.667 --> 45:19.026
And he's more successful than me
because he appears on television.

45:19.126 --> 45:20.401
(Chuckles)

45:20.501 --> 45:23.651
- Do you talk on television?
- What do you think I do?

45:23.751 --> 45:25.067
Play the flute?

45:25.167 --> 45:30.442
- What do you talk about?
- You name it... and I'll talk about it.

45:30.542 --> 45:34.451
He talks... about archaeology...

45:35.709 --> 45:37.026
Astrology...

45:37.126 --> 45:41.067
Anthropology,
sociolog... sociologgigy...

45:41.167 --> 45:42.909
Sociology.

45:45.834 --> 45:47.659
Codology.

45:50.334 --> 45:52.117
And sex.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.534
In that order.

45:55.251 --> 45:57.576
He suits the medium.

45:59.126 --> 46:02.117
You mean, you think
that I don't suit the medium?

46:04.751 --> 46:07.534
They wouldn't let you
within ten miles of the medium!

46:10.626 --> 46:12.617
I have an appointment...

46:13.334 --> 46:15.742
With your producer...

46:17.251 --> 46:18.609
Next week.

46:18.709 --> 46:20.442
(Clears throat)

46:20.542 --> 46:21.901
With my producer?

46:22.001 --> 46:23.659
Your producer!

46:28.334 --> 46:32.076
- Charley: With old bill Smith?
- We're going home now.

46:32.542 --> 46:33.901
Asked to see me.

46:34.001 --> 46:35.359
(Mumbles drunkenly)

46:35.459 --> 46:39.276
You're... going to appear
on my television show.

46:39.376 --> 46:41.359
And I will run you out of town, kid.

46:41.459 --> 46:42.817
(Laughs)

46:42.917 --> 46:45.942
- Stephen, he wants to drive back.
- Who does?

46:46.042 --> 46:47.284
William!

46:48.126 --> 46:50.567
William: Do you hear me?
I'll drive you home.

46:50.667 --> 46:52.859
(Chuckles) Impossible!

46:52.959 --> 46:54.276
He's drunk!

46:54.376 --> 46:57.492
- I'll drive.
- You haven't got a license.

46:58.292 --> 47:01.192
- William, can I drive?
- Rosalind: No, you'll have to stay.

47:01.292 --> 47:03.067
I will drive.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.734
We'd better stay.

47:04.834 --> 47:07.067
- Well, I'll drive!
- No, you won't!

47:07.167 --> 47:09.617
- Well, then Charley can drive.
- Oh, to hell!

47:14.584 --> 47:15.942
Look here.

47:16.042 --> 47:17.617
Come on, boy.

47:19.209 --> 47:21.117
You are slightly drunk.

47:22.417 --> 47:23.859
You may stay.

47:23.959 --> 47:27.026
Why the bloody hell
do you want us to bloody well stay?

47:27.126 --> 47:28.784
Come on now.

47:44.751 --> 47:46.534
Will you excuse me?

47:49.292 --> 47:51.326
But of course, my dear fellow.

48:22.209 --> 48:24.242
(Snorts)

48:26.751 --> 48:28.326
(Sniffs)

48:30.626 --> 48:32.326
(Sighs)

48:41.501 --> 48:43.034
(Sighs)

48:45.292 --> 48:46.951
They're staying.

48:50.542 --> 48:54.492
Which room is everybody in?

48:59.167 --> 49:01.159
How the hell should I know?

49:02.084 --> 49:03.617
(Sniffs)

49:08.459 --> 49:10.367
Splendid day.

49:14.376 --> 49:16.651
It gives me great pleasure

49:16.751 --> 49:20.284
to know that you
enjoyed your day with us.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.784
Good night.

49:25.626 --> 49:27.526
(Chuckles)

49:27.626 --> 49:29.326
Good night.

49:48.334 --> 49:49.951
(Sighs)

49:57.209 --> 49:58.951
(Puffs)

50:04.501 --> 50:06.242
(Dog whimpers)

50:28.584 --> 50:30.117
(Sniffs)

51:39.334 --> 51:40.951
Anna?

52:35.709 --> 52:37.534
Rosalind.

52:42.084 --> 52:43.951
Darling.

52:44.584 --> 52:46.284
What?

52:49.126 --> 52:50.909
I love you.

52:52.501 --> 52:54.034
Mm.

53:03.417 --> 53:05.117
(Sighs)

53:20.584 --> 53:22.284
(Phone buzzes)

53:23.834 --> 53:25.701
Reception.

53:26.709 --> 53:29.951
Yes, I see. Thank you.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.151
I'm afraid mr Smith isn't here.

53:34.251 --> 53:36.159
Will you see mr bell?

53:36.626 --> 53:38.734
Er... all right.

53:38.834 --> 53:41.817
Turn right as you go out.
One flight down to the annexe.

53:41.917 --> 53:44.234
- It's the fifth door on the left.
- Thank you.

53:44.334 --> 53:45.867
You can't miss it.

54:04.709 --> 54:06.909
(Phone rings)

54:12.709 --> 54:14.909
(Typewriters clicking)

54:21.084 --> 54:23.284
(Phone rings)

54:30.376 --> 54:34.326
Hello. I'm bell. Remember me? I'm bell.

54:34.751 --> 54:36.576
- Erm...
- I was up at Oxford.

54:37.001 --> 54:39.151
Oh, yes, of course. How are you?

54:39.251 --> 54:41.067
Bill Smith's ill. He's in hospital.

54:41.167 --> 54:44.192
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I've got to go see him. Got that file?

54:44.292 --> 54:47.367
- I don't actually know him.
- You don't know him?

54:47.792 --> 54:49.651
What did he want you for? Do you know?

54:49.751 --> 54:51.984
- Well, I think...
- Do you ever see Francesca?

54:52.084 --> 54:55.326
- Who?
- Francesca. The provost's daughter.

54:56.792 --> 54:58.451
The daughter of the provost.

55:01.459 --> 55:03.076
Ah, yes.

55:04.084 --> 55:05.442
No, I don't.

55:05.542 --> 55:07.409
You knew her well.

55:08.334 --> 55:10.151
I've been married for some years.

55:10.251 --> 55:12.326
Well done.

55:14.501 --> 55:16.942
Ah, yes. Bill was thinking of you
for the panel.

55:17.042 --> 55:19.151
I've got to see him in a minute.
He's very ill.

55:19.251 --> 55:21.685
- What's the matter with bill?
- He's very bad. He's in hospital.

55:21.709 --> 55:23.109
Mr bill's secretary...

55:23.209 --> 55:25.109
I think he was thinking of me for...

55:25.209 --> 55:28.234
He was perfectly all right yesterday.
We had a drink together.

55:28.334 --> 55:31.192
- I don't believe it.
- I don't know what his plans were.

55:31.292 --> 55:32.692
What happened to him?

55:32.792 --> 55:35.442
Perhaps I can let you know.
He collapsed last night.

55:35.542 --> 55:39.151
Look, why don't you come and see him?
I'm going there now to see him.

55:39.251 --> 55:41.859
- What time are you going?
- I'm going now.

55:41.959 --> 55:45.026
All right. Sorry about all this.
Give my love to Francesca.

55:45.126 --> 55:47.526
- I haven't see her.
- Are you going straightaway?

55:47.626 --> 55:49.242
I'm going right away! Now!

55:52.917 --> 55:55.117
(Phone being dialled)

56:03.251 --> 56:05.276
(Phone rings)

56:05.376 --> 56:07.534
Woman: <i>Hello?</i>

56:08.876 --> 56:10.492
(Coins clinking)

56:12.084 --> 56:13.617
<i>Hello?</i>

56:18.751 --> 56:20.534
<i>Hello?</i>

56:27.917 --> 56:29.492
Francesca?

56:46.459 --> 56:49.742
Francesca:
<i>I was in my bath when you phoned.</i>

57:07.751 --> 57:11.367
<i>You haven't changed at all.
Not at all.</i>

57:14.751 --> 57:16.701
Stephen: <i>Wonderful to see you.</i>

57:25.667 --> 57:28.117
Francesca:
<i>I was in my bath when you phoned.</i>

57:31.542 --> 57:35.951
Stephen:
<i>Well, it must be... ten years?</i>

57:50.751 --> 57:52.492
Francesca: <i>Ten years?</i>

57:54.251 --> 57:55.992
<i>It can't be.</i>

57:57.501 --> 57:59.242
<i>It can't be.</i>

58:01.751 --> 58:03.451
<i>Must be.</i>

58:04.626 --> 58:06.367
Stephen: <i>It must be.</i>

58:07.626 --> 58:09.451
Francesca: <i>It is.</i>

58:24.917 --> 58:27.326
Stephen: <i>You don't look a day older.</i>

58:30.709 --> 58:34.159
Francesca:
<i>Oh, really? I'm ten years older.</i>

58:56.501 --> 58:58.284
<i>How's your wife?</i>

59:15.792 --> 59:19.076
Stephen: <i>It's a beautiful dress
and a beautiful coat.</i>

59:20.542 --> 59:22.201
<i>You look marvellous.</i>

59:58.417 --> 01:00:01.576
Francesca:
<i>I'm in consumer research. Did you know?</i>

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.201
<i>It's fascinating.</i>

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:16.701
Stephen: <i>Do you remember
those times in the car? Do you?</i>

01:00:17.584 --> 01:00:19.451
<i>Well, do you?</i>

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.951
Francesca: <i>Of course I remember.</i>

01:00:32.626 --> 01:00:34.409
<i>I remember.</i>

01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:56.617
<i>I'm supposed to be on a diet.
I'm too fat.</i>

01:01:00.459 --> 01:01:02.817
<i>So then you have three?</i>

01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:06.534
<i>Three children. Good gracious!</i>

01:01:09.959 --> 01:01:11.951
Stephen: <i>You're not fat.</i>

01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.784
Francesca: <i>I'm very happy.</i>

01:01:20.834 --> 01:01:22.784
<i>My life is happy.</i>

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:44.742
<i>Have I changed?</i>

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:50.117
Stephen: <i>You're the same.</i>

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:54.242
Francesca: <i>The same as I was?</i>

01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:58.784
<i>The same as I was then?</i>

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:05.034
Stephen: <i>The same.</i>

01:02:18.834 --> 01:02:20.701
(Car door shuts)

01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:42.367
(Groans)

01:02:47.084 --> 01:02:49.284
(Clock chimes)

01:02:51.542 --> 01:02:53.159
(Sighs)

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.909
(Floorboards creaking)

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:24.784
(Sighs)

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:31.451
Hello.

01:03:46.834 --> 01:03:48.867
I've just come from London.

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:51.534
I know.

01:03:54.709 --> 01:03:56.992
To see the television people.

01:03:59.376 --> 01:04:00.992
Did you see them?

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:10.742
I'm hungry-

01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:30.034
(Sighs)

01:04:44.084 --> 01:04:46.326
I'm going to make an omelette.

01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:49.701
We don't want any.

01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:56.276
Shall I cook?

01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:57.909
Can you?

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:07.201
Give me a cigarette.

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.192
I wrote to you.

01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:17.859
The letter is in the hall.
You didn't get it.

01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:19.701
I left early.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.742
Get the letter.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.034
There it is.

01:05:50.084 --> 01:05:51.742
Another one for you.

01:05:52.626 --> 01:05:54.367
From my wife.

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:58.117
A personal letter.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.242
From her to you.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:04.701
Open it.

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:25.367
De-da, de-da, de-da, de-da...

01:06:31.126 --> 01:06:32.701
Ah.

01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:37.409
"So I just want to beg you that while...

01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:42.826
"Still being understanding,
sympathetic, et cetera...

01:06:43.626 --> 01:06:45.567
"You don't necessarily show to him

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:48.367
"you think it's the great thing
of his life.

01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:53.067
"You might even hint
that sooner or later,

01:06:53.167 --> 01:06:55.242
"you'll be bored to death by her.

01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:57.609
"I believe this, of course,

01:06:57.709 --> 01:07:00.867
"but naturally I'm in
a wrong position even to hint.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.451
"I always...

01:07:05.042 --> 01:07:10.451
"Wondered what this would be like
if and when it happened.

01:07:12.084 --> 01:07:14.367
"But I must say it beats everything.

01:07:16.334 --> 01:07:18.201
"Love, Laura.

01:07:19.917 --> 01:07:25.242
"Ps, don't say I wrote this
for heaven's sake."

01:07:37.626 --> 01:07:40.317
I thought you didn't want any.

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:43.326
- I didn't.
- Then why are you eating it?

01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:47.284
Mind your own damn bloody business!

01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:26.067
- What are you doing?
- Making the bed.

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:29.442
No need to do that.
A woman comes in every morning.

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:30.984
I can do it.

01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:32.742
Leave it!

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:35.826
Please.

01:10:58.584 --> 01:11:00.117
Charley: Hello?

01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:02.909
Hello? Yes?

01:11:03.876 --> 01:11:06.534
This is palling 146.

01:11:07.834 --> 01:11:09.359
We are going.

01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:10.867
Charley: Yes.

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:15.567
Taxi. Now! To go into Oxford.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:17.784
You might as well stay.

01:11:19.292 --> 01:11:22.776
- It's very late.
- Charley: Straight away, ok?

01:11:22.876 --> 01:11:24.409
Bye.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.451
Anna?

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:33.451
I've got a taxi.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.201
It's on its way.

01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.201
Shut the door, for god's sake.

01:11:53.001 --> 01:11:56.067
It was her idea.
She knew rosalind was away.

01:11:56.167 --> 01:11:58.942
She said you wouldn't mind.

01:11:59.042 --> 01:12:01.067
I don't mind.

01:12:01.167 --> 01:12:03.201
Nothing to do with me.

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:06.242
It's your bloody house!

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:14.617
Anyway, I wrote to you.

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:18.617
You didn't get the damn letter.

01:12:20.084 --> 01:12:22.117
- When did it start?
- What?

01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:26.909
Weeks ago. Weeks.

01:12:30.959 --> 01:12:33.451
We used to go to her room
in the afternoon.

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:38.034
Didn't even have a lock on the door.
Anyone could have come in.

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:40.534
Someone did come in once.

01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:42.534
A girl.

01:12:43.084 --> 01:12:44.701
Can you imagine?

01:12:46.417 --> 01:12:49.201
Anyway, I'm sleeping at college
most of the time now.

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:51.784
I can't take her there, can I?

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:58.242
Where can I damn well take her?

01:13:04.209 --> 01:13:07.617
I thought she and William were...
Close friends.

01:13:08.167 --> 01:13:12.117
They are. They're just friends.
Means nothing.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:18.492
She's not a whore.

01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:30.826
I don't know what to do, you see.

01:13:34.251 --> 01:13:36.492
I can't have enough of her.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.367
(Car approaches)

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:53.117
I don't know what to do.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.284
Where's your car?

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:13.367
Laura's got it.

01:14:14.876 --> 01:14:17.234
I will see rosalind tomorrow
at her mother's.

01:14:17.334 --> 01:14:20.401
And I'm going to William's house.
I've been invited down.

01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:22.617
You can bring her here for the weekend.

01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:26.534
Thanks.

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:30.367
(Sighs heavily)

01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:32.701
It's the children, you see.

01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:35.784
I'm never there.

01:14:37.792 --> 01:14:39.567
They're missing me.

01:14:39.667 --> 01:14:41.817
Anna: The taxi's waiting!

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:43.451
Coming!

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:50.409
This is your dressing gown.

01:14:59.334 --> 01:15:01.492
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

01:15:02.084 --> 01:15:03.734
How did you get in tonight?

01:15:03.834 --> 01:15:05.359
Through the lavatory window.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:07.442
You're getting a bit old for that,
aren't you?

01:15:07.542 --> 01:15:10.242
- Yes, I am.
- Here's a key.

01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:17.534
Thanks.

01:15:21.126 --> 01:15:22.867
One more question.

01:15:26.667 --> 01:15:28.242
What?

01:15:28.876 --> 01:15:32.534
Last Sunday night,
when you all stayed...

01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:35.076
Did you sleep with her here?

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:37.742
Of course I did.

01:15:42.334 --> 01:15:44.151
Did you see anyone in London?

01:15:44.251 --> 01:15:45.784
No.

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:49.109
What happened
about the television people?

01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:51.576
Nothing. Wasn't any good.

01:15:53.959 --> 01:15:55.984
You look wonderful.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.159
I feel it. I feel great.

01:16:03.001 --> 01:16:05.534
- I wish you could stay.
- So do I.

01:16:06.626 --> 01:16:09.567
Still, you'll have a good time
at William's house, won't you?

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.867
With all those lords and ladies.

01:16:14.126 --> 01:16:16.159
What's the matter?

01:16:39.959 --> 01:16:42.484
- Hello, Laura.
- Hello, Stephen.

01:16:42.584 --> 01:16:45.484
The door was open. How are you?

01:16:45.584 --> 01:16:47.367
Fine.

01:16:48.626 --> 01:16:50.242
What are you doing?

01:16:52.501 --> 01:16:54.576
Charley's not here.

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.284
I got your letter.

01:16:59.251 --> 01:17:01.242
I'm just doing the garden.

01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.826
When I got back from London...

01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:10.442
Charley and Anna were there.

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:12.484
Charley and Anna?

01:17:12.584 --> 01:17:14.317
Yeah.

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.742
- Together in the house?
- Mm.

01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:21.367
I was... I got back late a bit drunk.

01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:24.701
I was astonished.

01:17:25.334 --> 01:17:27.234
Why were you drunk?

01:17:27.334 --> 01:17:29.651
Oh, I had dinner with Francesca.

01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:32.484
You remember. You remember Francesca?

01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:33.984
Yes.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.867
I just gave her a ring, you know.

01:17:36.334 --> 01:17:37.909
It was quite pleasant.

01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:43.117
He's sleeping with her, is he?

01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:46.026
Hm? Who?

01:17:46.126 --> 01:17:48.276
Charley. With Anna.

01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:49.776
Yeah, of course.

01:17:49.876 --> 01:17:51.776
How pathetic!

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:54.776
- What do you mean?
- Poor, stupid, old man.

01:17:54.876 --> 01:17:58.326
- He's not old!
- Stupid bastard!

01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:03.534
Does Laura know?

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:06.442
Yes.

01:18:06.542 --> 01:18:08.784
And what about the children?
Has he told them?

01:18:13.417 --> 01:18:16.492
- Do you want me to come?
- Yes.

01:18:17.084 --> 01:18:20.359
It's just that I'm trying to tell you.

01:18:20.459 --> 01:18:22.451
Do you want some coffee?

01:18:23.334 --> 01:18:25.451
No, I don't want any coffee.

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:29.992
Listen...

01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:33.367
This, this thing...

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:37.367
I-I-It's nothing.

01:18:38.376 --> 01:18:40.867
It'll all f-f-f... fall flat.

01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:44.701
He says he's in love with her.

01:18:45.251 --> 01:18:48.951
Love. Everyone thinks they're in love.

01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:51.867
Do you?

01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:56.151
I've never heard of anything
so bloody puerile, so banal!

01:18:56.251 --> 01:18:57.942
What's banal about it?

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:00.317
Poor, stupid little bitch.

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:03.109
You just calling people stupid.
What's the use of...?

01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:06.451
Well, they are. Except Laura.

01:19:07.167 --> 01:19:09.159
She's stupid too.

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:13.326
You chucked them out, I hope.

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:20.159
- Laura: Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:27.034
I think I'll pop in and see Laura.
It's on my way.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.201
Give her my love.

01:19:32.126 --> 01:19:35.192
I wanted to meet your father. I'm sorry.

01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:38.817
Anna was coming down but she's got
some of her family over or something.

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:40.401
Ah.

01:19:40.501 --> 01:19:43.151
I've never thanked you
for introducing us.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:44.867
I didn't.

01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:55.034
Haven't you ever played
this game before?

01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:58.151
No.

01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:01.234
Tradition. We all played it at school.

01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:02.692
Oh.

01:20:02.792 --> 01:20:05.034
You'll enjoy it. It's fun.

01:20:08.501 --> 01:20:10.576
This is the ball. You see?

01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:15.617
I think you should go in goal.

01:20:17.292 --> 01:20:20.034
- Where is it?
- Down there by that door.

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:42.234
I have a funny feeling
that this is a murderous game.

01:20:42.334 --> 01:20:44.034
Not at all.

01:20:45.834 --> 01:20:48.784
Isn't it true that every aristocrat
wants to die?

01:20:53.001 --> 01:20:54.617
I don't.

01:20:57.876 --> 01:20:59.234
What do I do in goal?

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:01.034
Defend it.

01:21:01.626 --> 01:21:03.951
- How?
- Any way you like.

01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:09.276
- Can't I just watch?
- No.

01:21:09.376 --> 01:21:12.192
You're a house guest. You must play.

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:14.442
Only the old men watch.

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:16.117
And the ladies.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.576
(Shouting)

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:13.992
(Shouting)

01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:16.784
(Muffled cries)

01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:21.076
(Shouting)

01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:27.242
(Shouting)

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:32.367
(Shouting)

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:56.942
(Shouting)

01:22:57.042 --> 01:22:58.409
(Grunts)

01:23:02.626 --> 01:23:04.367
(Grunts)

01:23:10.626 --> 01:23:12.451
(Applause)

01:23:19.084 --> 01:23:20.617
(Grunts)

01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:23.776
(Grunts and groans)

01:23:23.876 --> 01:23:25.534
(Girls laughing)

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.367
(Bells toll)

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.742
(Applause)

01:23:43.876 --> 01:23:46.151
- You want one?
- No, thank you, provost. No.

01:23:46.251 --> 01:23:49.692
- Don't you smoke?
- Pipe.

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:53.576
- Ah.
- Charley: Come on!

01:23:54.584 --> 01:23:56.284
And again!

01:23:58.501 --> 01:23:59.951
Come on!

01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:21.201
Owzat?!

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:27.159
(Applause)

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:43.284
Hard luck.

01:24:52.042 --> 01:24:54.992
He really is a magnificent athlete,
that boy.

01:24:56.584 --> 01:24:58.359
Yes.

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:00.159
He's a natural.

01:25:01.084 --> 01:25:02.567
That boy.

01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:05.159
I was quite good myself. I...

01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:09.451
But not altogether in the same class.
Stephen, were you any good?

01:25:10.084 --> 01:25:11.534
No.

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:24.317
(Applause)

01:25:24.417 --> 01:25:28.492
I... saw Francesca when I was in London.

01:25:32.167 --> 01:25:34.034
- Your daughter.
- Ah.

01:25:35.042 --> 01:25:37.617
- How is she?
- Very well.

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:40.234
She sent you her love.

01:25:40.334 --> 01:25:43.951
Ah, please give her mine
when you see her again.

01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:48.609
Oh, I don't know
when I shall be seeing her again.

01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:51.909
(Bells toll)

01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:12.909
(Clock chimes)

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.867
Hello.

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:51.742
Hello.

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:55.026
Have a nice weekend?

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:58.326
Yes. Thank you for your hospitality.

01:27:02.376 --> 01:27:04.242
I'm getting married.

01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:11.159
Oh. Who to?

01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:13.284
William.

01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:19.492
Ah.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:21.951
Have you told him?

01:27:27.667 --> 01:27:29.659
Well, congratulations.

01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:35.367
I wonder if you could
tell Charley for me.

01:27:38.584 --> 01:27:40.576
Will you let me know what he says?

01:27:43.084 --> 01:27:44.734
Hello.

01:27:44.834 --> 01:27:46.742
(Groans)

01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:49.901
- Well played.
- Thanks!

01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:52.692
Look, I want to come and see you.
Have a word with you.

01:27:52.792 --> 01:27:55.484
Can I come tonight after this party?
It'll be a bit late.

01:27:55.584 --> 01:27:58.992
- Yes, sure. What's the trouble?
- No trouble. No trouble at all.

01:28:00.251 --> 01:28:02.942
- You coming?
- I don't want her!

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:05.526
I want a man-to-man talk!

01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:09.359
Well, we can talk when she's in bed.
She can sleep in the spare room.

01:28:09.459 --> 01:28:11.817
- Can't you?
- That would be nice.

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:13.784
Ok. We'll see you later. Come on!

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:02.159
(Pants)

01:29:11.917 --> 01:29:14.117
(Anna groans)

01:29:17.459 --> 01:29:19.659
(Pants)

01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:32.201
(Anna groans)

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:39.784
(Groans)

01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:45.659

01:29:57.542 --> 01:29:59.742

01:30:05.334 --> 01:30:07.192
(Pants)

01:30:07.292 --> 01:30:09.076
It's all right.

01:30:19.292 --> 01:30:21.284
(Gasps)

01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:27.201
(Sobs)

01:30:52.667 --> 01:30:54.442
Did anyone know you were with him?

01:30:54.542 --> 01:30:56.742
(Anna pants)

01:31:00.584 --> 01:31:03.242
You can hear, can't you?

01:31:05.959 --> 01:31:08.284
(Sobs)

01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:12.909
(Grunts)

01:31:16.917 --> 01:31:19.117
(Sobs)

01:31:26.667 --> 01:31:28.867
(Phone rings)

01:31:51.167 --> 01:31:54.034
Did anyone know
you were coming here with him?

01:31:58.501 --> 01:32:01.609
Was he supposed to have
dropped you off at your room?

01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:03.492
(Phone stops ringing)

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:08.784
He's dead.

01:32:17.417 --> 01:32:19.242
You had an accident.

01:32:20.542 --> 01:32:22.201
You crashed.

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:28.867
You were driving, weren't you?

01:32:31.584 --> 01:32:33.784
(Phone rings)

01:33:10.209 --> 01:33:12.409
(Phone stops ringing)

01:33:42.001 --> 01:33:43.951
Someone may see you.

01:34:58.709 --> 01:35:00.909
(Cockerel crows)

01:35:16.959 --> 01:35:18.576
Right.

01:35:33.167 --> 01:35:34.992
Your handbag.

01:35:36.667 --> 01:35:38.867
(Phone rings)

01:35:51.417 --> 01:35:53.359
Hello?

01:35:53.459 --> 01:35:54.992
Yes.

01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:58.234
Oh, have you?

01:35:58.334 --> 01:36:00.701
Oh, I was asleep. I... I didn't hear it.

01:36:04.751 --> 01:36:06.284
Yes.

01:36:07.751 --> 01:36:09.284
Ah.

01:36:10.459 --> 01:36:12.242
I see.

01:36:13.376 --> 01:36:15.117
She's all right.

01:36:16.376 --> 01:36:17.909
Yes.

01:36:18.459 --> 01:36:21.867
Er... i-i-i-I'll get dressed
right away and get... get over.

01:36:24.001 --> 01:36:25.534
Thank you.

01:36:26.501 --> 01:36:28.034
Thank you.

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:32.784
Oh, i-i-I'm sorry
that I-I didn't hear the t...

01:36:47.584 --> 01:36:49.784
(Car doors shut)

01:36:50.459 --> 01:36:52.076
(Car engine)

01:37:08.417 --> 01:37:09.951
(Turns engine off)

01:37:11.126 --> 01:37:12.992
No one will see you.

01:37:58.334 --> 01:38:02.034
Rosalind: They phoned you.
You weren't there.

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:04.992
Stephen: I was asleep. I didn't hear.

01:38:06.376 --> 01:38:08.317
He can't breathe.

01:38:08.417 --> 01:38:11.326
It's difficult for him to breathe.
Did you see?

01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:14.617
But he is breathing.

01:38:14.917 --> 01:38:16.826
They're helping him.

01:38:19.292 --> 01:38:22.492
- He isn't dead?
- No.

01:38:34.084 --> 01:38:35.784
Stephen!

01:38:37.584 --> 01:38:39.242
Stephen?

01:38:40.376 --> 01:38:42.576
(Pants)

01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:48.742
Er... I just heard about William.

01:38:51.376 --> 01:38:53.151
You found him.

01:38:53.251 --> 01:38:54.826
Yes.

01:38:57.542 --> 01:38:59.409
Does she know?

01:39:01.334 --> 01:39:03.117
I don't know.

01:39:05.792 --> 01:39:07.784
It must have been terrible for you.

01:39:12.667 --> 01:39:16.326
Look, erm...
You can leave this to me, if you like.

01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:20.451
No. It's all right.

01:39:35.001 --> 01:39:36.359
(Knocking)

01:39:36.459 --> 01:39:38.117
Stephen: Anna?

01:39:54.417 --> 01:39:56.034
What are you doing?

01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:04.067
- You've heard what's happened?
- Yes.

01:40:04.167 --> 01:40:05.784
Sorry.

01:40:07.459 --> 01:40:08.859
What happened? Was he drunk?

01:40:08.959 --> 01:40:11.867
They say there was whisky
all over the car. Was there?

01:40:13.167 --> 01:40:15.034
I didn't notice.

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:18.576
But you found him.

01:40:24.334 --> 01:40:26.367
How did you hear about it?

01:40:29.459 --> 01:40:31.734
What are you doing? Why are you packing?

01:40:31.834 --> 01:40:34.326
I'm going home.

01:40:37.251 --> 01:40:38.784
Why?

01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.492
Why are you going home?

01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:46.192
They were going to be married.

01:40:46.292 --> 01:40:48.942
- Rubbish!
- He told me.

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:52.409
It's rubbish! Look, I know it's...

01:40:53.667 --> 01:40:55.442
Terrible but...

01:40:55.542 --> 01:40:57.617
There's no reason for you to go home.

01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:03.951
Why don't you leave her alone?

01:41:18.626 --> 01:41:22.242
How did she hear about it? I've just
heard about it from the provost.

01:41:24.001 --> 01:41:25.576
Wake up.

01:41:28.376 --> 01:41:32.317
Stephen: I haven't slept. Sorry.

01:41:32.417 --> 01:41:33.951
I'm a bit tired.

01:41:38.917 --> 01:41:40.442
What's the matter with her?

01:41:40.542 --> 01:41:43.117
She didn't care anything about him.
Nothing.

01:41:44.334 --> 01:41:47.159
What is she going home for?
It's ridiculous!

01:41:47.917 --> 01:41:49.909
There's nothing to keep her here.

01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:55.409
She loves me.
What are you talking about?

01:41:56.167 --> 01:41:57.909
My taxi should be here.

01:42:01.459 --> 01:42:04.409
- Have you got a flight?
- Yes, I've booked a flight.

01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:08.992
Why don't you stay for the funeral?

01:42:15.417 --> 01:42:17.784
- Is this all?
- Yes.

01:42:21.876 --> 01:42:23.742
I'll take it down.

01:42:34.917 --> 01:42:36.909
Goodbye.

01:43:08.334 --> 01:43:10.742
(Engine starts)

01:43:28.126 --> 01:43:30.326
(Bells toll)

01:43:55.917 --> 01:43:58.117
(Clock chimes)

01:44:26.584 --> 01:44:28.784
(Car approaches)

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.034
Oh, I know!

01:44:43.459 --> 01:44:45.659
(Car revs)

01:44:57.417 --> 01:44:59.617
(Tyres screeching)

01:45:00.834 --> 01:45:04.034
(Car crashes and glass smashes)
