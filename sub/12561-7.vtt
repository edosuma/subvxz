00:00.807 --> 00:02.007
- I'm Hank.

00:02.008 --> 00:04.242
I was your typical
emergency room doctor,

00:04.243 --> 00:05.510
Until I got fired.

00:05.511 --> 00:07.311
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:07.312 --> 00:08.845
To save some
kid off the street.

00:08.846 --> 00:10.544
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:10.545 --> 00:12.188
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:12.189 --> 00:14.258
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons.

00:14.259 --> 00:15.478
Is this an arranged marriage?

00:15.479 --> 00:17.335
- Yes.
- Do you wanna marry him?

00:17.336 --> 00:20.596
- I know many couples
who got married deeply in love.

00:20.597 --> 00:21.739
Now they barely speak.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.658
- But does it feel
right to you?

00:23.659 --> 00:25.543
- We have to
stop being emotional

00:25.544 --> 00:27.019
About logical decisions.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.399
- Oh, my God, you
went through with it.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.970
You got engaged.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.952
- I'm raising money
for a local free clinic.

00:31.953 --> 00:34.234
- Dr. Emily peck.
I'm Dr. Lawson's replacement.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.581
- Why would he need replacing?

00:35.582 --> 00:37.662
Are you sticking around?
- I am.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.640
- I'm setting up my
own concierge practice here.

00:39.641 --> 00:41.079
The Hamptons is big enough
for the both of us,

00:41.080 --> 00:42.455
Don't you think, Hank?

00:49.945 --> 00:52.758
- Order up for
the beautiful Jill.

00:52.759 --> 00:54.096
Sorry, folks, we're all out.

00:55.369 --> 00:57.211
- Man, am I
glad to see you, Mac.

00:57.212 --> 00:59.251
One week without your
lobster Mac and cheese

00:59.252 --> 01:01.292
Was pure torture.
- Yeah, well...

01:01.293 --> 01:02.797
Big Mac here was in the shop.

01:02.798 --> 01:05.203
- Yeah, I heard.
Everything okay?

01:05.203 --> 01:07.445
- Some bumps and bruises,
nothing major.

01:07.446 --> 01:10.726
Take a Fender bender over
a deep fryer burn anytime.

01:10.727 --> 01:12.833
Which is a good thing,
since car insurance

01:12.834 --> 01:14.539
Is a lot cheaper
than medical insurance.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.376
- Mac, you could've
called Dr. Lawson.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.815
I gave his number to Donna

01:17.816 --> 01:19.185
When I ran into her
the other day.

01:19.186 --> 01:20.857
- Ah, well...

01:20.858 --> 01:22.427
We haven't been
talking much lately.

01:22.428 --> 01:24.536
- Really?

01:24.537 --> 01:26.506
Well, she didn't say anything.

01:26.507 --> 01:27.678
- Not surprised.

01:27.679 --> 01:29.281
You know, she's
probably embarrassed.

01:29.282 --> 01:32.023
They don't like to admit
they got the marital problems.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.029
- Yeah, well...
Been there, done that.

01:34.030 --> 01:35.634
- I don't know,
you guys just always seem

01:35.635 --> 01:37.504
Like you're so happy...

01:39.646 --> 01:40.814
Okay.

01:40.815 --> 01:43.053
Clearly not my business.

01:43.054 --> 01:44.792
Glad to know you're okay!

01:50.036 --> 01:51.371
- Here you go.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.078
- Oh, thank you.

01:54.079 --> 01:57.753
- So...
What do you think?

01:57.754 --> 01:59.691
- I think comfort food
shouldn't involve

01:59.692 --> 02:01.293
Long lines or lobster.

02:01.294 --> 02:02.797
- I was talking
about the clinic.

02:02.798 --> 02:04.333
- Oh, right.

02:04.334 --> 02:06.503
Uh, yeah.
Well, from what I've read,

02:06.504 --> 02:09.273
It looks like your family clinic
won't be up and running

02:09.274 --> 02:12.275
Until about 2015.
If at all.

02:12.276 --> 02:13.410
- So I was right.

02:13.411 --> 02:15.145
The wording in
the proposal does allow

02:15.146 --> 02:17.379
The hospital to loan
itself the clinic funds.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.446
- Yeah, and then use
the moy however they want.

02:19.447 --> 02:21.750
- I can't let the board
get away with this.

02:21.751 --> 02:23.620
I'm gonna give Dr. Blair
a counter-proposal.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.256
- Well, I can let Evan
take a closer look.

02:25.257 --> 02:27.560
He's good with numbers,
and liars.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.463
- So...
- Mm!

02:29.464 --> 02:31.968
- I hear that Emily peck
has decided to stay in town.

02:31.969 --> 02:34.239
- Oh, yeah.
That's what she told me too.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.777
- Aren't you worried about
a competing concierge doctor

02:36.778 --> 02:38.446
Taking your patients?
- No.

02:38.447 --> 02:40.482
I mean, there's enough
out here to go around.

02:40.483 --> 02:43.020
- Mm-hmm.
- Unlike the Mac and cheese.

02:50.968 --> 02:53.171
- This new Jaguar is so cool.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.007
And now that hankmed's
back ithe black,

02:55.008 --> 02:58.012
I figure maybe
we can afford it...Maybe?

02:58.013 --> 02:59.649
- I need to leave early today.

02:59.650 --> 03:02.553
- Really, why?
Trouble in paradise?

03:02.554 --> 03:04.189
- It's personal.

03:04.190 --> 03:06.660
- Well, with you,
personal means trouble, so.

03:06.661 --> 03:09.130
- No, personal means personal.

03:09.131 --> 03:10.498
- Well, I'll tell you what,

03:10.499 --> 03:12.935
I will support your need
to leave early today,

03:12.936 --> 03:15.205
If you support
my need for new wheels.

03:16.876 --> 03:20.246
'cause I need them so bad.

03:20.247 --> 03:21.448
- Hankmed.

03:21.449 --> 03:22.817
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hey.

03:22.818 --> 03:24.987
So Divya wants
to leave early today,

03:24.988 --> 03:26.656
I think you should
say "yes."

03:26.657 --> 03:28.625
- Evan needs a car,
you should say "no."

03:28.626 --> 03:31.063
- Yes...To both.
- What?

03:31.064 --> 03:33.299
- Okay, 3211 seaview drive.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.069
Don't move,
we'll be right there.

03:35.070 --> 03:36.404
Okay, I'm gonna go with Divya.

03:36.405 --> 03:37.539
Read this for me, will you?

03:37.540 --> 03:39.075
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

03:39.076 --> 03:42.714
And here is your car...
For the day.

03:42.715 --> 03:44.883
- The Saab?
Ha...

03:44.884 --> 03:46.452
I meant my own car.

03:49.991 --> 03:52.695
- Over here!

03:52.696 --> 03:53.997
Hurry, please.

03:53.998 --> 03:56.100
I'm in pain.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.809
- Just what I thought.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.943
So you fractured your ankle.

04:05.944 --> 04:07.444
- Yeah, of course.

04:07.445 --> 04:09.978
- We'll splint it today and
put the cast on it tomorrow.

04:09.979 --> 04:12.680
- Wait, can we make
that sooner?

04:12.681 --> 04:14.748
I'm moving. Today.
- No.

04:14.749 --> 04:16.281
We have to wait for
the swelling to go down.

04:16.283 --> 04:17.350
Besides, you
shouldn't be walking,

04:17.351 --> 04:18.416
Let alone driving.

04:18.418 --> 04:20.219
I'll pay you double.

04:20.220 --> 04:21.320
- What?
- Triple?

04:21.321 --> 04:22.921
- No.
- Why are you in such a hurry?

04:22.922 --> 04:24.956
- I'm not comfortable here.

04:24.957 --> 04:28.124
- Donna! Hello!

04:28.125 --> 04:29.426
- That's just my husband.

04:29.427 --> 04:30.827
Don't pay attention, he's fine.

04:30.828 --> 04:34.062
- help me!

04:34.063 --> 04:35.663
- What is
that god-awful sound?

04:35.664 --> 04:38.465
- It's just the chaise lounge
I tied him to.

04:38.466 --> 04:40.199
- Donna!
- I just wanted to

04:40.200 --> 04:42.768
Pack up the truck
undisturbed while he slept.

04:42.769 --> 04:44.337
- When did you
plan on untying him?

04:44.338 --> 04:47.539
- After I loaded the truck,
but then I fell down the stairs.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.374
- Come on!

04:49.375 --> 04:51.275
- I wasn't trying to hurt him.

04:52.810 --> 04:53.910
- Donna!

- You okay?

06:08.619 --> 06:09.853
Breathe.
Just breathe.

06:09.854 --> 06:11.020
Breathe through your nose.

06:11.021 --> 06:12.021
that's it.

06:12.022 --> 06:13.256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:13.257 --> 06:15.960
- Sure.
Who are you?

06:15.961 --> 06:18.431
- Hank!

06:18.432 --> 06:21.802
- More importantly...
Who are you?

06:21.803 --> 06:25.872
Hey, Donna.
She's hot.

06:25.873 --> 06:27.640
All right, all right.

06:27.641 --> 06:29.275
- Here we go.

06:29.276 --> 06:30.610
- It started when we got here.

06:30.611 --> 06:32.211
That's when
he started flirting with

06:32.212 --> 06:35.114
Every hottie and hoochie
who stepped up to the truck.

06:35.115 --> 06:37.213
No offense.
- None taken.

06:37.214 --> 06:39.949
- Oh, it's not my fault.
The Hamptons is lousy with them.

06:39.950 --> 06:42.885
- So you think
the Hamptons changed Mac?

06:42.886 --> 06:45.319
- I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's been great for business.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.755
- So why did you leave queens?

06:47.756 --> 06:49.056
- Mac's fancy pants cousin

06:49.057 --> 06:50.457
Gave us this place
for the summer.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.757
A belated wedding gift.

06:51.758 --> 06:53.457
- Sure beats a toaster.

06:53.458 --> 06:56.025
- The success of the Mac truck,
it went straight to his head.

06:56.026 --> 06:58.226
He took his flirting
to a whole new level.

06:58.227 --> 07:01.162
Yesterday, he hit on my sister.

07:01.163 --> 07:02.730
Hey!

07:02.731 --> 07:04.764
I'm telling them about Lacey.

07:04.765 --> 07:06.532
- Oh, let that go already.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.867
Can you believe it?

07:07.868 --> 07:10.202
No shame, no apology.

07:10.203 --> 07:12.270
It's like he doesn't even care.

07:12.271 --> 07:15.774
I know what I did
might seem crazy.

07:15.775 --> 07:18.242
But I was at my wit's end.

07:18.243 --> 07:19.710
And I didn't want him
to stop me.

07:19.711 --> 07:21.678
- You were leaving him.

07:21.679 --> 07:23.413
- I just wanna go home.

07:23.414 --> 07:25.582
- Sorry to interrupt.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.550
But, um, you didn't
answer your phone.

07:27.551 --> 07:28.751
- Yeah, it's a little wet.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.286
- That's not your color.
At all.

07:30.287 --> 07:32.254
It's horrible, in fact.
- Evan, and why are you here?

07:32.255 --> 07:34.456
- New client called.
Kiteboarding accident.

07:34.457 --> 07:36.858
She sounded scared.
Sexy, but scared.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.192
- Go with Evan.
I'll finish here.

07:38.193 --> 07:39.360
- Okay.

07:39.361 --> 07:43.530
- Mom!
Why would I lie?

07:43.531 --> 07:46.299
Fine, fine.
I'll send pictures.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.569
I'll send so many
that you'll be able

07:49.570 --> 07:51.906
To wallpaper the house
with them.

07:51.907 --> 07:53.306
Yeah.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.741
Okay, well, maybe
not the whole house,

07:54.742 --> 07:56.675
But your
gift-wrapping room

07:56.676 --> 07:58.177
Or dad's trophy room.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.278
In fact, I am going
to send so many

08:00.279 --> 08:04.015
That you're gonna wish
I didn't have a boyfriend.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.752
Hi.
- Hi.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.554
- Paige Collins.
You must be the other doctor.

08:10.555 --> 08:12.723
- Oh. Sorry,
the other doctor?

08:12.724 --> 08:14.224
- Yeah, I wanted
someone here quickly

08:14.225 --> 08:15.993
So I called two doctors.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.961
The paramedics left
after the first one arrived.

08:17.962 --> 08:19.763
- I heard there was
a kiteboarding accident

08:19.764 --> 08:21.131
Is everything okay?

08:21.132 --> 08:23.802
- My boyfriend Graham
fell off his board

08:23.803 --> 08:26.605
When he was shooting pictures
and sliced his shin.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.540
- So is the other doctor
giving him stitches?

08:28.541 --> 08:30.141
- Mm-hmm, right now.
On the beach.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.576
- Two doctors?
What is this?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.010
First come, first serve?

08:33.011 --> 08:36.414
- Oh, there he is.
Hi, baby!

08:36.414 --> 08:38.515
- He doesn't look injured.
- Oh, no, not him.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.852
The hot guy.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.355
- Thold dude?

08:46.925 --> 08:50.027
- If the wound bleeds
or drains, call me.

08:50.028 --> 08:51.494
And don't get it wet
until tomorrow,

08:51.495 --> 08:52.862
Okay, Graham?

08:52.863 --> 08:54.329
- You're very demanding,
aren't you?

08:54.330 --> 08:55.430
Yes.

08:55.431 --> 08:56.831
But I'm even tougher on myself.

08:56.832 --> 08:58.633
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

08:58.634 --> 09:00.334
Baby, let me help you.

09:00.335 --> 09:02.336
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

09:03.972 --> 09:05.706
What are you doing here?

09:05.707 --> 09:07.173
- I was called to
see a patient.

09:07.174 --> 09:09.008
- My patient.
- Oh.

09:09.009 --> 09:10.410
- He's fine.

09:10.411 --> 09:12.446
You snooze, you lose,
Dr. Lawson.

09:12.447 --> 09:14.815
- Okay.

09:21.421 --> 09:22.855
- What is taking so long?

09:22.856 --> 09:24.623
You better not make raj
wait this long

09:24.624 --> 09:26.592
On your wedding night.
- Mother!

09:26.593 --> 09:28.126
- Well, what's the trouble?

09:30.463 --> 09:31.963
- This is the trouble.

09:31.964 --> 09:34.364
- I don't understand,
you look beautiful.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.999
- As long as no one
has to see me from behind.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.234
- This is a very bad omen.

09:40.235 --> 09:42.869
- No, it's just confusion
over the measurements.

09:42.870 --> 09:46.304
We will sort it all out,
everything will be fine.

09:46.305 --> 09:48.706
- We'll take no chances,
I'll contact pundit-ji.

09:48.707 --> 09:51.007
- Your spiritual advisor,
mother?

09:51.008 --> 09:53.142
- You may not agree,
but he will tell us

09:53.143 --> 09:55.010
Exactly what we need
to do to fix it.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.712
- I already know
what we need to do.

09:56.713 --> 09:59.214
Find some matching fabric.

10:02.617 --> 10:04.284
- Are you sure I can't pay you?

10:04.285 --> 10:06.719
- Oh, absolutely.
I didn't do anything.

10:10.690 --> 10:14.792
- Um...Could I ask you
a couple questions?

10:14.793 --> 10:16.927
In private?

10:16.928 --> 10:18.861
- Uh, yeah.

10:18.862 --> 10:22.297
- Yeah, I'll just...
I'll hang out.

10:22.298 --> 10:23.531
- Are you married?

10:23.532 --> 10:26.633
If not, are you dating
or living with anyone?

10:26.634 --> 10:27.901
And if you are married,

10:27.902 --> 10:29.902
Why aren't you wearing
your wedding ring?

10:29.903 --> 10:31.169
- Uh...
- Are you separated?

10:31.170 --> 10:32.670
Or just kinda creepy?

10:32.671 --> 10:35.941
- Uh, no, no, and
the last three don't apply.

10:35.942 --> 10:37.243
Why?

10:37.244 --> 10:38.978
- This shouldn't be
as weird as it sounds,

10:38.979 --> 10:42.080
But would you be willing
to be my faux beau?

10:42.081 --> 10:44.082
- Faux beau?

10:44.083 --> 10:45.817
- Pretend boyfriend.

10:45.818 --> 10:47.585
Listen, my parents
won't stop hassling me

10:47.586 --> 10:49.353
About getting married.

10:49.354 --> 10:50.521
They want grandkids.

10:50.522 --> 10:52.191
And I would just need you to

10:52.192 --> 10:53.727
Take some pictures with me.

10:53.728 --> 10:56.330
- Why don't you take pictures
with your actual boyfriend?

10:58.933 --> 11:00.901
- Not that I care
about his age... I don't...

11:00.902 --> 11:02.268
But they would.

11:02.269 --> 11:04.203
And I'm tired of
disappointing them.

11:04.204 --> 11:05.938
- Yeah, I think I'll pass.

11:05.939 --> 11:07.639
I'm not sure if
your plan is flawed,

11:07.640 --> 11:09.741
Misguided,
or just kinda creepy.

11:11.244 --> 11:14.379
A sense of humor...
Another plus.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.213
Just think about it.

11:16.214 --> 11:19.583
- I did.

11:19.584 --> 11:22.553
- You know, my brother
may reject indecent proposals,

11:22.554 --> 11:25.288
I tend to be
a tad more progressive.

11:25.289 --> 11:27.791
- Hm.

11:29.693 --> 11:31.393
- I like your outfit.

11:31.394 --> 11:33.562
Makes you seem less uptight.

11:33.563 --> 11:36.231
Oh! I'm uptight?

11:38.233 --> 11:40.500
- Did you check Graham
for a concussion?

11:40.501 --> 11:43.635
- I did,
even though he sustained

11:43.636 --> 11:46.872
A three centimeter intermediate
laceration to the shin.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.207
His head is fine.
- Okay.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.146
Hey, Graham.
Dr. Hank Lawson.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.314
- Hey.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.949
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.383
Oh, you mean my slip?

12:00.384 --> 12:02.285
Nothing to worry about.
Thanks for asking.

12:02.286 --> 12:05.021
- Okay.

12:18.724 --> 12:21.494
- So, Paige, I've been giving

12:21.495 --> 12:22.728
A lot of thought to your plan.

12:22.729 --> 12:24.630
- So have I.
I want Hank.

12:24.631 --> 12:27.369
And I will pay you
a finder's fee to convince him.

12:27.370 --> 12:29.371
- All right.
You are not gonna get Hank.

12:29.372 --> 12:31.473
I tend to get what I want.

12:31.474 --> 12:33.041
- You will never
get it from Hank

12:33.042 --> 12:34.609
In a million years.
Trust me.

12:34.610 --> 12:35.776
He's as stubborn as an ox.

12:35.777 --> 12:37.545
- Mule.
- Ox.

12:37.546 --> 12:38.913
- I see the family resemblance.

12:38.914 --> 12:41.715
20 seconds to win me over.
Go.

12:41.716 --> 12:43.283
- Do you like basketball?

12:43.284 --> 12:46.385
- Kobe, Shaq, Lebron.
- Yes.

12:46.386 --> 12:47.753
Just think of Lebron as Hank.

12:47.754 --> 12:49.154
You don't want Lebron, okay.

12:49.155 --> 12:51.489
Who you want is the guy
who signs Lebron's checks.

12:51.490 --> 12:52.924
- You sign Lebron's checks?

12:52.925 --> 12:54.993
- If the NBA were called hankmed
and Hank were Lebron,

12:54.994 --> 12:56.427
That's exactly right.

12:56.428 --> 12:58.996
Now you have
three seconds to say yes.

12:58.997 --> 13:01.966
Go.

13:05.269 --> 13:08.171
- What, you made storyboards?

13:08.172 --> 13:09.805
You're actually
a really good artist.

13:09.806 --> 13:11.807
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:11.808 --> 13:13.775
You're also insane.

13:13.776 --> 13:16.344
Like, look at all this.

13:16.345 --> 13:19.112
- My father has
a military background.

13:19.113 --> 13:20.880
He thinks four steps ahead.

13:20.881 --> 13:22.481
So I have to think five.

13:22.482 --> 13:24.616
- Wow. You must
really dig this guy.

13:24.617 --> 13:26.451
- If you had told me
16 months ago

13:26.452 --> 13:27.953
That I was gonna meet
and fall in love

13:27.954 --> 13:29.954
With an older man...
- 16 months?

13:29.955 --> 13:31.488
That's a long time
to keep a secret.

13:31.489 --> 13:33.356
- It's been easy, until now.

13:33.357 --> 13:35.359
My parents travel all the time.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.261
But this time,
Graham's leaving for Egypt.

13:38.262 --> 13:39.495
- Oh.

13:39.496 --> 13:41.297
- He's gonna be
gone about three months...

13:41.298 --> 13:43.265
I wanna go with him.

13:43.266 --> 13:45.400
- You need your parents'
permission to go on a trip?

13:45.401 --> 13:47.802
- Well, as long as
I need their money,

13:47.803 --> 13:50.704
I need their permission.
- Ah.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.539
- This is the only way
I can be with him.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.507
At least for now.
- I get it.

13:54.508 --> 13:56.442
Sometimes you have
to do something crazy

13:56.443 --> 13:58.977
To do something wonderful.

13:58.978 --> 14:00.344
- You've done
something similar?

14:00.345 --> 14:02.046
- Yeah.

14:02.047 --> 14:05.850
Yeah, it's how I ended up
in the Hamptons.

14:05.851 --> 14:08.620
- I'll pick you up
at 10:00 for your makeover.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.689
- Sorry, pretty heiress
said what now?

14:10.690 --> 14:12.323
- Does the "you"
that's sitting here now

14:12.324 --> 14:14.225
Look like the "you"
I need to be in there?

14:14.226 --> 14:17.494
- Oh. Well, this guy,
you know, he's...

14:17.495 --> 14:19.462
Better make it 9:00.

14:19.463 --> 14:23.800
- Hello?

14:23.801 --> 14:25.569
Graham?
It's me, Hank.

14:25.570 --> 14:28.138
- Um, I'm back here.

14:30.341 --> 14:32.008
- Graham, everything okay?

14:32.009 --> 14:35.445
- I had an incident
in the dark room.

14:35.446 --> 14:37.179
It's nothing.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.212
- Um...
Actually, it's something.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.645
Come here.

14:43.646 --> 14:45.111
- I didn't wanna call you,

14:45.112 --> 14:47.780
But I knew when Paige
saw these burns,

14:47.781 --> 14:49.181
She was gonna call someone.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.849
And it wasn't
gonna be Dr. Peck.

14:52.318 --> 14:54.919
- Paige would never admit it,
but she is the jealous type.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.022
She's also one of the best
things that ever happened to me.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.856
- Apparently a lot
has happened to you.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.658
- I was gored by
an elephant in Kenya.

15:02.659 --> 15:04.193
- Mm.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.028
- And I got caught in
an avalanche in the alps.

15:06.029 --> 15:07.229
- Wow.

15:07.230 --> 15:09.097
- I broke my shoulder
running from a bull.

15:09.098 --> 15:10.665
- In Pamplona?
- No.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.400
- This was a photo shoot
in Texas.

15:12.401 --> 15:14.902
- Right.
- Ow.

15:14.903 --> 15:16.770
- Oh, sorry if this is
a little uncomfortable.

15:16.771 --> 15:20.039
- Comfort's overrated.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.041
- Do you mind if I take a look

15:22.042 --> 15:24.275
At those chemicals
you were mixing?

15:24.276 --> 15:25.643
- Sure.

15:33.050 --> 15:35.885
Nitrocellulose,
ethyl alcohol...

15:35.886 --> 15:37.853
I've been using these chemicals
since I was a kid

15:37.854 --> 15:39.655
Developing wet plate photos.

15:39.656 --> 15:41.422
- This one's ethyl ether.

15:41.423 --> 15:42.924
- Oh, I hope not.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.959
Ethyl ether mixed
with nitrocellulose

15:44.960 --> 15:47.962
Would produce an explo...

15:47.963 --> 15:49.562
An explosion.

15:49.563 --> 15:52.898
Which is exactly what happened.

15:52.899 --> 15:54.499
- Graham, when
was the last time

15:54.500 --> 15:56.067
You had your eyes checked?

15:56.068 --> 15:58.970
- I think Gerald Ford
was president.

15:58.971 --> 16:01.572
- I'd like you to see
this ophthalmologist I know.

16:01.573 --> 16:03.340
- I'm fine.
- Look,

16:03.341 --> 16:05.407
If not for yourself,
then for Paige.

16:05.408 --> 16:07.709
Okay.

16:17.453 --> 16:19.721
- So...

16:19.722 --> 16:21.555
When's your big day?

16:21.556 --> 16:24.090
- Incredibly soon.
In London.

16:24.091 --> 16:25.525
Where my fiance lives.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.126
- Wait, so you live here
and he lives in London?

16:28.127 --> 16:29.794
Keep it that way,
I think it could work.

16:29.795 --> 16:33.631
- Thanks for
the marital advice.

16:33.632 --> 16:35.700
- Hey, Donna.

16:35.701 --> 16:40.304
You look beautiful.

16:40.305 --> 16:42.672
You look beautiful too.

16:42.673 --> 16:45.741
oh, hey, Donna...

16:45.742 --> 16:47.643
That medicine you
gave me isn't working.

16:47.644 --> 16:49.645
- Yeah, well, maybe you
need to give it some more time.

16:49.646 --> 16:51.179
- Maybe you didn't
give me the right amount.

16:51.180 --> 16:54.315
- I think I know what a person
with a stomach ache needs.

16:54.316 --> 16:56.550
- A belly rub?
- All right, that's it.

16:56.551 --> 16:58.318
I have had it with you!

16:58.319 --> 17:00.019
Just go.

17:05.124 --> 17:08.526
- Donna...
What did you give him?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.261
- The usual pink stuff.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.430
And if I'm lucky,
whatever it is he has

17:13.431 --> 17:14.665
Is fatal.

17:27.978 --> 17:29.612
- People are looking at me.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.781
- They're not looking at you,
they're looking at me.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.683
- Stop fidgeting.

17:33.684 --> 17:36.987
Get rid of your gum.

17:36.988 --> 17:38.955
I can't believe
you just did that.

17:40.324 --> 17:42.222
- Ms. Collins,
so nice to see you.

17:42.223 --> 17:43.856
How may we help you today?

17:43.857 --> 17:45.291
- See that guy over there?

17:45.292 --> 17:47.792
He is gonna need some clothes.

17:47.793 --> 17:49.693
Lots of clothes.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.161
- Okay.

17:51.162 --> 17:53.697
Please get Ms. Collins'
friend whatever he wants.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.798
- Whatever I want?

17:54.799 --> 17:55.799
- Yes.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.368
- Pizza.
Pepperoni.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.136
Great.

18:00.137 --> 18:01.770
Who... whoa, make it two.

18:08.242 --> 18:09.642
- I like it.

18:09.643 --> 18:12.044
Do you like it?
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:37.098 --> 18:39.802
- Ah.

18:41.106 --> 18:43.176
- Make him look sophisticated.

18:50.451 --> 18:53.553
Now people are looking at you.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.542
I like this one, not that one.

19:22.543 --> 19:24.277
Oh, so cute!
- Come here.

19:24.278 --> 19:25.445
- What?
What are you doing?

19:25.446 --> 19:26.880
- We're not done yet.

19:26.881 --> 19:28.782
Here we go.

19:28.783 --> 19:30.350
Sit back.
- Okay.

19:31.418 --> 19:31.617
- Okay, here we go.
...

19:31.618 --> 19:33.018
I hd

19:33.019 --> 19:34.950
Ah!

19:34.951 --> 19:37.952
- Um...

19:40.956 --> 19:42.723
- That was a surprise.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.592
- Well, you make a much better
faux beau than I expected.

19:53.900 --> 19:57.436
- That was
the best day...Ever.

19:57.437 --> 19:59.638
- Yeah.

19:59.639 --> 20:01.006
We did take
some great pictures.

20:01.007 --> 20:02.541
- Yeah.
- Just...

20:02.542 --> 20:04.610
I'm not sure of the ones
we took in the photo booth.

20:04.611 --> 20:06.945
- Are you kidding?

20:06.946 --> 20:08.212
- We're clearly in love.

20:08.213 --> 20:09.413
Look at this.
This is so good.

20:09.414 --> 20:11.648
- Oh, that reminds me.

20:15.485 --> 20:17.485
Thanks again.

20:17.486 --> 20:19.354
- Yeah.

20:19.355 --> 20:20.922
that'll do it.

20:20.923 --> 20:22.823
- Hey, baby.

20:22.824 --> 20:26.293
How are you?

20:26.294 --> 20:27.661
It's Graham.
I gotta go.

20:27.662 --> 20:29.629
- Right, um...
- Yeah.

20:29.630 --> 20:31.464
Could you...
Could you drive me down?

20:31.465 --> 20:32.631
- No, no, really.
I gotta go.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.467
Okay.
Oh, okay.

20:35.468 --> 20:39.870
well, me too.

20:39.871 --> 20:43.674
Yeah.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.009
Of course.
Yeah.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.878
Uh.
Worst. Day. Ever.

20:48.879 --> 20:52.147
Yeah, totally boring.

20:52.148 --> 20:54.783
Okay.

20:54.784 --> 20:57.352
- So...

20:59.054 --> 21:01.322
Bye.

21:10.197 --> 21:11.831
- Mac got sick,

21:11.832 --> 21:14.733
Donna gave him something
and now Mac's even sicker.

21:14.734 --> 21:17.068
It's all very curious.
- Mm-hmm.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.236
Why can't I sync up my email?

21:19.237 --> 21:21.171
- Here.
Give it to me.

21:21.172 --> 21:22.706
- But you don't seriously think

21:22.707 --> 21:24.741
She's trying to get rid of him?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.242
- I don't know what I think.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.778
But they are very...
Unusual newlyweds.

21:29.779 --> 21:31.378
- That's true.

21:34.382 --> 21:35.748
Evan?

21:35.749 --> 21:38.116
- Oh, look who needed
to feel pretty.

21:38.117 --> 21:39.718
- Are you wearing makeup, dude?
- Yeah.

21:39.719 --> 21:42.590
- Why?
- Becau...

21:42.591 --> 21:46.728
Because I'm a whore.

21:46.729 --> 21:48.996
I'm a dirty whore.

21:52.834 --> 21:54.167
- Do you know
what that was about?

21:54.168 --> 21:56.502
- Well, yes.
Evan is a dirty whore.

21:56.503 --> 21:58.871
- Right.

21:58.872 --> 22:00.205
He'll be fine.

22:00.206 --> 22:01.907
Mac and Donna.
- Yeah.

22:01.908 --> 22:03.608
You wanna test
the bottle for poison?

22:03.609 --> 22:04.942
- I know it sounds crazy.

22:04.943 --> 22:06.510
But I am worried
that this is more than

22:06.511 --> 22:08.945
Fractured ankles
and broken hearts.

22:08.946 --> 22:11.481
And I'm worried that
if we don't solve this soon,

22:11.482 --> 22:13.516
Stranger things
are going to happen.

22:20.694 --> 22:22.895
- So you wanna
fight dirty, huh?

22:22.896 --> 22:23.996
- Emily, come on in.

22:23.997 --> 22:25.197
- No, don't get
me wrong, you know.

22:25.198 --> 22:26.598
I'm up for that.

22:26.599 --> 22:29.000
Just don't hide and
not take my calls afterwards.

22:29.001 --> 22:30.902
- No, no, no,
I'm setting up a new phone

22:30.903 --> 22:32.470
And I have...
okay, I'm sorry, time out.

22:32.471 --> 22:33.837
What are we talking about?

22:33.838 --> 22:35.772
- Oh, you know exactly
what we're talking about.

22:35.773 --> 22:38.975
Graham Barnes.
You stoled my client!

22:38.976 --> 22:40.543
- "stoled?"
what are you saying?

22:40.544 --> 22:42.944
I'm confused.
- Don't try to obfuscate, okay.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.646
He was my patient first.

22:44.647 --> 22:46.714
- No, I'm confused that
a woman who says "obfuscate"

22:46.715 --> 22:48.182
Also says "stoled."
for the record,

22:48.183 --> 22:49.949
I did neither.
- I don't believe you.

22:49.950 --> 22:51.584
- Call him yourself, I think
it's the green button.

22:51.585 --> 22:52.951
- Why would I call him?

22:52.952 --> 22:54.919
Apparently, he's
not even my patient anymore.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.988
- Emily, I did not
try to steal your patient.

22:56.989 --> 22:59.491
- I knew that he was trying
to resist my recommendations,

22:59.492 --> 23:00.727
But I just
didn't think that you

23:00.728 --> 23:01.928
Would take advantage of that.

23:01.929 --> 23:04.431
- I did not
take advantage, okay?

23:04.432 --> 23:05.932
But what did you recommend?

23:05.933 --> 23:08.901
- I had the nerve to insist
that Mr. Peter Pan himself

23:08.902 --> 23:10.135
Have a full work-up.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.937
You know,
I've dated older guys.

23:11.938 --> 23:13.471
They all have the same issue.

23:13.472 --> 23:15.840
- Yeah, they favor tights,
pixie dust, fighting pirates.

23:15.841 --> 23:18.309
- No, what they like is
never growing up.

23:18.310 --> 23:20.310
You know,
when a guy Graham's age

23:20.311 --> 23:21.845
Has two falls in one week?

23:21.846 --> 23:23.379
- You've seen Graham twice?

23:23.380 --> 23:25.781
- Yes, the kiteboarding
incident was my second visit.

23:25.782 --> 23:27.616
He had a mountain biking
accident the week before.

23:27.617 --> 23:29.651
- Yeah, he had an accident
today too, in his dark room.

23:29.652 --> 23:31.352
- There's definitely
something going on,

23:31.353 --> 23:32.820
And I think
it's age-related.

23:32.821 --> 23:34.155
- Age-related?

23:34.156 --> 23:35.656
The guy looks better
than most men half his age.

23:35.657 --> 23:37.124
No, he spends his time
in exotic locales,

23:37.125 --> 23:38.959
I'd say
it's lifestyle-related.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.694
- You wanna bet?

23:40.695 --> 23:42.529
- On a patient's diagnosis?

23:42.530 --> 23:43.863
Please.

23:43.864 --> 23:46.031
- Oh, no, you are
not uptight at all.

23:46.032 --> 23:48.966
He's not in the room with us,
I wouldn't do that.

23:48.967 --> 23:51.402
- No...
- Okay.

23:51.403 --> 23:53.738
Let's call it
a differential, not a bet.

23:53.739 --> 23:56.274
- All right.
A differential.

23:56.275 --> 23:57.675
You're on.

23:57.676 --> 23:59.843
- Loser buys dinner.
- Sounds good.

23:59.844 --> 24:00.910
- Okay.
- You'll be buying.

24:02.379 --> 24:05.047
Hi.

24:05.048 --> 24:06.649
Bad time?

24:06.650 --> 24:07.850
- No, no.
Not at all.

24:07.851 --> 24:11.252
Jill Casey...
Dr. Emily peck.

24:11.253 --> 24:12.720
- Jill Casey.

24:12.721 --> 24:14.655
You're administrator
of Hamptons heritage.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.423
- Yeah, I am.
Nice to meet you.

24:16.424 --> 24:18.258
- I'll call you.
We'll do lunch.

24:18.259 --> 24:20.426
- Okay.
And we'll do dinner.

24:20.427 --> 24:23.929
You'll be buying.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.002
- Is this awkward?

24:32.003 --> 24:34.038
- Not for me.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.607
So how does this
provide me with leverage?

24:36.608 --> 24:38.008
- Right now
the clinic funds are held

24:38.009 --> 24:39.543
In a separate nonprofit.

24:39.544 --> 24:41.278
- Yeah, the board
insisted I create one.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.213
- Yeah, and though you
intended to run the clinic

24:43.214 --> 24:44.715
Through Hamptons heritage,

24:44.716 --> 24:47.417
There's no reason you couldn't
enlist another hospital.

24:47.418 --> 24:49.152
- Ah.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.054
The board would have
a big problem with that.

24:51.055 --> 24:53.723
- And that would be
the least of their problems.

24:53.724 --> 24:56.159
I mean,
imagine the pr nightmare

24:56.160 --> 24:58.028
When this revealed they're
trying to borrow from

24:58.029 --> 25:00.297
Rather than build
a community clinic.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.433
- And that's my leverage.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.835
Hank, thank you.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.970
- Yeah, sure.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.677
- Hey, any news from the lab?

25:14.678 --> 25:16.178
- We'll have
the results by noon.

25:16.179 --> 25:17.711
- But you wanna check
on Mac now.

25:17.712 --> 25:18.811
- You know what, first...

25:18.812 --> 25:21.145
I wanna make
a confession, guys.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.712
- You took Paige up
on her offer.

25:22.713 --> 25:24.646
You were her faux beau.

25:24.647 --> 25:26.043
- What gave me away?

25:26.044 --> 25:27.209
- Oh, I don't know.

25:27.210 --> 25:28.608
The shopping bags,
the highlights,

25:28.609 --> 25:29.876
The faint smell of lavender?

25:29.877 --> 25:30.843
- That was tuberose, actually.

25:30.844 --> 25:31.910
- Oh, good to know.

25:31.911 --> 25:33.545
- If the lab calls,
please forward?

25:33.546 --> 25:34.745
- Mm-hmm.
- You guys wanna hear

25:34.746 --> 25:36.447
The valuable lesson I learned?

25:36.448 --> 25:37.914
- No.
- Look, it turns out

25:37.915 --> 25:42.584
That I am easily seduced by
the world of glamour and money,

25:42.585 --> 25:45.253
Because it's where I wanna be.

25:45.254 --> 25:47.088
- Okay, the lesson
that you should've learned

25:47.089 --> 25:49.490
Is that you shouldn't
fake date for money.

25:49.491 --> 25:50.625
- It started out that way

25:50.626 --> 25:52.160
But then halfway through

25:52.161 --> 25:53.661
I realized that
I actually liked her.

25:53.662 --> 25:55.562
A lot.
And I wanted to help her.

25:55.563 --> 25:57.965
Anyway.
As a sign of my growth,

25:57.966 --> 26:00.634
I am forgoing
my coveted Jaguar.

26:00.635 --> 26:03.470
I am putting the tainted
funds into hankmed.

26:03.471 --> 26:07.173
- Mm?

26:07.174 --> 26:09.208
- Mm.
- Div.

26:09.209 --> 26:10.476
Did something happen with raj?

26:10.477 --> 26:13.739
- Mm-mm.
- Where's your ring?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.940
- Oh, my God.
My ring.

26:15.941 --> 26:18.141
- Oh, so you're not...
you're not disengaged.

26:18.142 --> 26:19.509
- Of course not.

26:19.510 --> 26:22.044
- You lost your engagement ring
and didn't even notice?

26:22.045 --> 26:24.079
Divya, that's...
that's a bad sign.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.214
- Stop it.
You sound like my mother.

26:26.215 --> 26:27.649
- All right, think, divya.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.817
Sometimes you take
your ring off for procedures.

26:35.956 --> 26:37.624
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.259
Ca - w n I help you?

26:39.260 --> 26:40.960
- I lost my engagement ring.

26:40.961 --> 26:42.794
And I think I left it
in your kitchen.

26:42.795 --> 26:44.796
- Oh.

26:44.797 --> 26:49.000
Wait here.

26:49.001 --> 26:50.834
- That was suspicious.

26:50.835 --> 26:53.136
- Yeah.

26:53.137 --> 26:54.538
So is that.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.375
- Hey, guys!

26:59.376 --> 27:00.877
Grab a spoon.

27:00.878 --> 27:02.845
- Well, at least
he's still alive.

27:02.846 --> 27:04.546
- I thought I asked you
to wait outside.

27:04.547 --> 27:06.315
- There was blood on the porch.

27:06.316 --> 27:08.116
- From my ankle.

27:08.117 --> 27:10.651
I got an itch
and I grabbed a hanger.

27:10.652 --> 27:12.686
I think there's
something stuck in there.

27:12.687 --> 27:13.721
- My ring.

27:13.722 --> 27:16.957
- Oh, no.
- Hey, Mac.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.225
You okay, buddy?

27:19.560 --> 27:20.994
- He's sitting on the couch

27:20.995 --> 27:23.362
Wearing his underpants
and macaro,

27:23.363 --> 27:24.997
What do you think?

27:26.933 --> 27:28.533
- Okay, that's new.

27:28.534 --> 27:30.168
- I think it's time
for a neuro exam.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.650
- Graham.

27:49.651 --> 27:52.653
Uh, Paige texted me.

27:52.654 --> 27:54.121
She said to meet her here?

27:54.122 --> 27:56.490
- Paige didn't text you.
I did.

27:56.491 --> 27:58.825
- Oh.

27:58.826 --> 28:00.960
Uh, sorry.
I'm a little confused.

28:00.961 --> 28:03.996
- Maybe this
will clear things up.

28:03.997 --> 28:05.531
- Oh, my God.

28:05.532 --> 28:06.898
Uh, I mean...

28:06.899 --> 28:09.200
Graham, it's not
what it looks like.

28:09.201 --> 28:10.968
And for the first time
in history,

28:10.969 --> 28:12.570
Those words are actually true.

28:14.672 --> 28:16.073
- Well, why don't
you come on in

28:16.074 --> 28:18.008
And we'll talk about it.

28:18.009 --> 28:19.842
- Okay.

28:19.843 --> 28:22.478
Why don't I just come in
and hang out with only you.

28:22.479 --> 28:24.580
All right.

28:24.581 --> 28:27.249
- Blunt, antisocial behavior,

28:27.250 --> 28:30.618
Increased appetite,
strong desire to touch,

28:30.619 --> 28:31.853
What else?

28:31.854 --> 28:34.888
- He's been licking
the TV remotes.

28:34.889 --> 28:37.757
- And all this started
after you came to the Hamptons?

28:37.758 --> 28:41.092
we were good in queens.

28:41.093 --> 28:44.161
The truck was fine,
my foot was fine,

28:44.162 --> 28:45.728
Mac was fine.

28:45.729 --> 28:48.264
- I'm sorry, what do
you mean the truck was fine?

28:48.265 --> 28:49.531
- Oh, a few weeks ago,

28:49.532 --> 28:51.399
A hit and run driver
sideswiped the truck.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.067
- Was Mac in the truck?

28:53.068 --> 28:54.901
- He was parked on
the side of the road

28:54.902 --> 28:56.403
But he wasn't injured.

28:56.404 --> 28:57.770
I mean, he was knocked around.

28:57.771 --> 28:59.471
He bumped his head
and banged his elbow.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.706
- Bumped his head?
Did you see a doctor?

29:01.707 --> 29:02.874
- No.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.175
He didn't even
go to the hospital,

29:04.176 --> 29:06.309
He said he was fine.

29:06.310 --> 29:10.579
not what I was expecting.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.280
- What's wrong with Mac?

29:12.281 --> 29:14.648
- Okay, well his symptoms
seem to indicate

29:14.649 --> 29:16.651
Some sort of
neurological disorder.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.220
- Because of the accident?

29:18.221 --> 29:19.756
- You know, it makes sense.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.158
With the abnormal
behaviors and appetites.

29:22.159 --> 29:25.032
- Yeah, he needs
a ct scan and an MRI.

29:25.033 --> 29:26.905
Hopefully, then
we'll know how to help him.

29:26.906 --> 29:28.840
- I can't believe this.

29:28.841 --> 29:31.943
My poor Mac!

29:31.944 --> 29:33.945
- So this was all a show?

29:33.946 --> 29:35.145
- Yeah.

29:35.146 --> 29:36.513
- Why?

29:36.514 --> 29:38.915
- Oh, my God, this
is so uncomfortable.

29:38.916 --> 29:41.183
- Go on.

29:41.184 --> 29:43.052
- Because Paige wanted to get

29:43.053 --> 29:44.253
Her parents off her back

29:44.254 --> 29:47.422
And show them proof
that she wasn't single.

29:47.423 --> 29:49.823
- She has a boyfriend.
Me.

29:49.824 --> 29:51.625
- She didn't wanna alarm them.

29:51.626 --> 29:55.495
- Because I'm
a photographer? An artist?

29:55.496 --> 29:57.464
- No, I don't think
it's so much what you do,

29:57.465 --> 29:59.165
It's more that
you've been doing it

29:59.166 --> 30:01.266
For a really long time.

30:01.267 --> 30:04.335
Like, longer
than she's been alive.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.803
- I'm older than her,
who cares?

30:06.804 --> 30:08.938
- Her parents might.

30:08.939 --> 30:13.048
Because you're probably
older than they are too.

30:15.218 --> 30:17.519
I'm sorry.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.354
- I should see Paige.

30:19.355 --> 30:21.423
I need to talk to her.

30:21.424 --> 30:24.492
- You know what, Graham...

30:29.664 --> 30:31.565
Are you...?

30:31.566 --> 30:33.700
Graham!

30:33.701 --> 30:35.435
Are you all right?

30:35.436 --> 30:37.170
- Get Hank.

30:40.561 --> 30:41.727
- I think you've been
experiencing

30:41.728 --> 30:43.796
A series of mini-strokes.

30:43.797 --> 30:45.597
But in the eye.

30:45.598 --> 30:47.798
Once they start, they can
repeat with growing frequency.

30:47.799 --> 30:49.366
- I don't understand.

30:49.367 --> 30:52.136
You saw the ophthalmology
report, I'm fine.

30:52.137 --> 30:54.205
- These types of strokes
can be difficult to diagnose.

30:54.206 --> 30:56.039
They would have to be occurring
at the same time

30:56.040 --> 30:57.541
You were having an eye exam.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.876
- Oh, this is crazy.
- You need an ultrasound

30:59.877 --> 31:01.444
Of your carotid arteries
and an echo.

31:01.445 --> 31:03.045
Now, if there is another one...

31:03.046 --> 31:05.214
- No, I mean
it's happening right now.

31:05.215 --> 31:07.683
My left eye, I can't see.

31:07.684 --> 31:08.950
- What's going on, Hank?

31:08.951 --> 31:10.418
- He's in the middle
of an occlusion.

31:10.419 --> 31:12.887
It's an embolism in
the central retinal artery.

31:12.888 --> 31:14.388
If I don't dislodge
the occlusion,

31:14.389 --> 31:16.824
The retina will die and
he'll go blind in that eye.

31:16.825 --> 31:18.125
- This is my lens eye!

31:18.126 --> 31:19.526
If I can't see, I can't work!

31:19.527 --> 31:20.793
- Okay, close your eyes.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.161
I'm sorry I have to do this.

31:22.162 --> 31:23.229
- Do what?

31:23.230 --> 31:24.530
Ow!
- Oh, my God!

31:24.531 --> 31:28.032
okay, okay.

31:28.033 --> 31:30.401
Okay, can you see yet?

31:30.402 --> 31:32.336
- Um...

31:32.337 --> 31:33.604
No!
- Damn it.

31:33.605 --> 31:34.738
- We should
call 9-1-1, no?

31:34.739 --> 31:35.972
- No, by the time they get here

31:35.973 --> 31:37.207
It'll be too late either way.

31:37.208 --> 31:40.043
- You have to help me.
Just please help me.

31:40.044 --> 31:42.412
- Okay, I need
to make a slit lamp.

31:42.413 --> 31:44.313
Evan, take this tape,
rip it into thin strips.

31:48.485 --> 31:51.386
Graham, I'm gonna owe
you a new pair of glasses.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.988
Okay.
Good.

31:57.992 --> 32:01.427
Thank you.

32:01.428 --> 32:03.129
There it is.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.165
Okay.

32:08.635 --> 32:13.638
Okay.

32:13.639 --> 32:14.672
- Hank.

32:14.673 --> 32:16.007
What are you doing?

32:16.008 --> 32:17.541
- Paracentesis.

32:17.542 --> 32:19.343
It's a procedure
that will draw the fluid

32:19.344 --> 32:21.178
Out of his
eye's anterior chamber.

32:21.179 --> 32:23.012
It should lower the pressure

32:23.013 --> 32:24.613
And allow
the plaque to move out.

32:24.614 --> 32:26.081
Okay, don't move.

32:26.082 --> 32:27.583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

32:27.584 --> 32:29.451
This is gonna hurt, isn't it?

32:29.452 --> 32:30.751
- Just try to remember

32:30.752 --> 32:32.653
You find comfort overrated.

32:32.654 --> 32:36.322
Now stay on this
fixed point and don't move.

32:37.724 --> 32:39.891
Uh... just stare
and don't move.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.326
- Graham, he knows
what he's doing.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.861
Just try to relax.

32:43.862 --> 32:47.431
- Ah! Ah!

32:47.432 --> 32:50.466
Ah-ah! Oh!

32:50.467 --> 32:54.504
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God!

32:54.505 --> 32:56.307
- Good job, Graham,
put this on your eye.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.843
- That's it, right?

33:02.313 --> 33:03.713
Okay.
- Mm.

33:03.714 --> 33:06.649
Graham?
Graham.

33:06.650 --> 33:07.950
Can you see?

33:12.055 --> 33:13.722
- Yes.
- Yes?

33:13.723 --> 33:15.690
- Yeah, I can see.

33:15.691 --> 33:18.192
I can see.

33:18.193 --> 33:21.695
- Okay.
Okay.

33:28.435 --> 33:29.636
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:29.637 --> 33:31.271
- Jill said I might
find you here.

33:31.272 --> 33:33.172
- You first.
How's your patient?

33:33.173 --> 33:34.640
- Graham's getting
a full work-up,

33:34.641 --> 33:36.008
But it looks
like he'll be okay.

33:36.009 --> 33:37.376
- Mm.
- How's Mac?

33:37.377 --> 33:39.177
- Your suspicions about
a neurological disorder

33:39.178 --> 33:40.244
Were correct.

33:40.245 --> 33:41.545
The neurologists are thinking

33:41.546 --> 33:43.313
That it's kluver bucy syndrome.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.814
- Hyper-orality,
increased appetite,

33:45.815 --> 33:47.616
Inappropriate
social behaviors, yeah.

33:47.617 --> 33:49.317
- The good news is,
is that the meds

33:49.318 --> 33:51.219
Should help decrease
those urges,

33:51.220 --> 33:54.488
And that time should
help Mac's brain repair.

33:54.489 --> 33:55.522
- Good.

33:55.523 --> 33:56.989
- And I found my ring.

34:01.561 --> 34:04.162
- That's it.
- Yep.

34:04.163 --> 34:06.898
He ate it.

34:13.570 --> 34:17.472
- See?
Everything is fine.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.739
- Or not.

34:19.741 --> 34:20.907
Where's your engagement ring?

34:20.908 --> 34:23.208
- I am cleaning it.

34:25.847 --> 34:28.248
All right, what did
pundit-ji say now?

34:28.248 --> 34:30.016
<i>- He said, "forget
the wedding, lehenga,</i>

34:30.018 --> 34:31.351
There are bigger problems."

34:31.353 --> 34:32.754
- Bigger problems?

34:32.755 --> 34:34.489
- He said, "Divya's love
is destined

34:34.489 --> 34:37.261
To travel
through another man."

34:37.262 --> 34:39.764
- Well, pundit-ji
is wrong.

34:39.764 --> 34:41.966
Raj and I are deeply
committed to one another.

34:41.967 --> 34:44.768
<i>- Bacheh, I believe you.</i>

34:44.768 --> 34:47.036
But pundit-ji is
never wrong.

34:52.309 --> 34:54.677
- Order up for
the beautiful Jill.

34:54.678 --> 34:56.112
- Thank you.
- Please!

34:56.112 --> 34:57.479
Given what you've done for me,

34:57.480 --> 35:01.116
I am giving you a 6% discount
every Tuesday for life.

35:01.117 --> 35:02.450
- Well, do I have
to do the math?

35:02.451 --> 35:04.452
- It's the worst coupon ever.

35:04.453 --> 35:06.487
I'm kidding,
you eat on the house,

35:06.488 --> 35:08.322
Or the truck,
or whatever this is.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.823
- Well, thank you.

35:09.824 --> 35:11.624
Hey, I'm just glad
that you're really okay.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.126
- Well, thanks to Hank.

35:13.127 --> 35:16.228
He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

35:16.229 --> 35:17.996
He is.

35:21.534 --> 35:23.835
- How are you?
- Oh, hey!

35:27.439 --> 35:28.839
- Sorry I'm late.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.240
- Oh, it's okay.

35:30.241 --> 35:33.309
Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

35:33.310 --> 35:36.912
- Oh, yeah, I can't believe
how much better Mac is doing.

35:36.913 --> 35:38.446
Or how much better he looks.

35:38.447 --> 35:40.114
- I'm glad they're
working things out.

35:40.115 --> 35:41.616
- Come here.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.317
- Mm.
- All right?

35:47.522 --> 35:49.022
- No, no, no, no, no, I insist.

35:49.023 --> 35:50.857
- Oh, you finally admit
that you were wrong?

35:50.858 --> 35:52.659
Graham's illness
was age-related?

35:52.660 --> 35:54.626
- Excuse me,
but Graham's illness

35:54.627 --> 35:56.694
Could easily have been
lifestyle-related.

35:56.695 --> 35:59.931
You know, it's probably
more of a combo of both.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.499
- Okay, then we'll go Danish.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.166
- You mean dutch?

36:03.167 --> 36:06.035
- That's what I said.
- No, you said "danish."

36:06.036 --> 36:08.671
- Okay, whatever.

36:08.672 --> 36:10.973
Let's play for it.

36:10.974 --> 36:14.476
- You confuse your words
when you get flustered.

36:14.477 --> 36:16.144
- I do, but I didn't.

36:16.145 --> 36:18.179
- Either I make you nervous

36:18.180 --> 36:21.449
Or you have
a neurological disorder.

36:21.450 --> 36:23.184
- I do not have
a neurological disorder,

36:23.185 --> 36:27.053
And you do not make me nervous.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.689
- Okay.

36:28.690 --> 36:29.956
- Why don't you break?

36:29.957 --> 36:32.792

36:43.902 --> 36:45.069

Between Danish and dutch,

Goodnight, Hank.

37:53.186 --> 37:55.353

39:02.349 --> 39:03.782

talking about Graham.

39:12.819 --> 39:15.220
I am talking about
William and Ellen.

39:15.221 --> 39:18.023
- Oh.
Who are they?

39:18.024 --> 39:19.825
- I'll give you a hint.

39:19.826 --> 39:22.361
They're coming to town
to meet you.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.662
- William...

39:23.663 --> 39:25.496
You call your parents
by their first names?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.831
- No, but you will.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.432
Same fee as before?

39:29.433 --> 39:31.601
- Yeah, I don't
know about that.

39:31.602 --> 39:35.004
- Evan, when the general
wants to meet someone,

39:35.005 --> 39:36.939
It's not really a request.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.040
- All the more reason for them

39:38.041 --> 39:39.608
To finally meet Graham, right?

39:39.609 --> 39:41.676
- Graham left for Egypt.

39:41.677 --> 39:44.277
He said he couldn't
be with someone

39:44.278 --> 39:46.512
Who had to lie
about being with him.

39:46.513 --> 39:49.149
I-I should've listened
to your brother.

39:49.150 --> 39:51.386
It was not a smart plan.

39:51.387 --> 39:52.987
- I was with you for one day,

39:52.988 --> 39:55.553
It was clear to me
how much you loved him.

39:55.554 --> 39:57.884
If he didn't see that
then he left because of

39:57.885 --> 40:01.287
His own issues, not yours.

40:01.288 --> 40:02.454
- Thank you.

40:02.455 --> 40:05.123
- Yeah.

40:05.124 --> 40:06.758
- Is that your car?

40:06.759 --> 40:08.560
- This is not a car,
this is a van.

40:08.561 --> 40:10.361
This is a sienna, actually.

40:10.362 --> 40:11.962
And it floats like a cloud.

40:11.963 --> 40:15.199
A cloud that has xm radio
and a nav system,

40:15.200 --> 40:18.468
And can do this.

40:18.469 --> 40:19.669
and maybe this.

40:21.938 --> 40:25.440
My parents are gonna love you.

40:25.441 --> 40:28.442
- Paige, you know what,
wait a... wait, wait!

40:37.117 --> 40:38.618
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:38.619 --> 40:41.553
- Thanks for waiting.
- Yeah.

40:41.554 --> 40:44.989
- I just wanted to gauge
your comfort level on something.

40:44.990 --> 40:48.425
But first, I need to thank you.

40:48.426 --> 40:50.660
If my clinic
was up and running,

40:50.661 --> 40:52.695
I could've helped
Donna and Mac.

40:52.696 --> 40:54.863
But since it wasn't...

40:54.864 --> 40:56.398
I depended on you.

40:56.399 --> 40:58.333
- Yeah, no.
We were happy to help.

40:58.334 --> 40:59.634
- You always are.

40:59.635 --> 41:01.568
Which got me thinking.

41:01.569 --> 41:06.472
..
I came up with this.

41:06.473 --> 41:08.374
A new proposal.

41:08.375 --> 41:09.875
- Okay.

41:09.876 --> 41:11.744
- Hank, I don't
need Hamptons heritage,

41:11.745 --> 41:13.179
I don't even need four walls.

41:13.180 --> 41:17.549
All I really need are
committed professionals.

41:17.550 --> 41:19.818
- You want hankmed
to run your clinic?

41:19.819 --> 41:22.019
- There's still some details
that need to be worked out.

41:22.020 --> 41:26.489
But I just need
to know if you're in.

41:26.490 --> 41:28.324
- It's interesting.

41:28.325 --> 41:30.960
I mean, no overhead,
so virtually all funds

41:30.961 --> 41:33.362
Can be directed
specifically to patient care.

41:33.363 --> 41:35.397
- Yeah, equipment,
supplies, medications.

41:35.398 --> 41:36.898
Anything a patient might need.

41:36.899 --> 41:38.700
- I mean, from
a business standpoint,

41:38.701 --> 41:42.302
It's a great idea.
Really.

41:42.303 --> 41:45.472
- But from
a personal standpoint

41:45.473 --> 41:47.039
It makes you uncomfortable.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.941
- Well...

41:49.942 --> 41:53.011
Yeah.

41:53.012 --> 41:55.045
But comfort's overrated.
