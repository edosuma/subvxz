Hey. There you go.

Ta.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.039
Mol, phone.
I'm not at the Ivy.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.719
Oi, lip!

01:58.720 --> 02:01.079
Fancy a curry tonight, Bec?
Oh, yeah, please.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.559
Woke up dreaming of a bhuna.
A midweek curry?

02:03.560 --> 02:05.639
Fitting some lights
at the Queen's Head, Saturday.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.880
That'll pay for it.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.639
You need to switch it back on
when you do that.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.959
MOLLY: I'm not going to school.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.440

You've got school.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.360

02:22.000 --> 02:23.400
Hello?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.200
Yeah.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.080
Can I just check your dressing?

02:46.480 --> 02:47.640
Hm.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.959
Ever had your boobs weighed?

02:50.960 --> 02:53.759
No. Why?

02:53.760 --> 02:54.959
When we were kids, you'd say,

02:54.960 --> 02:56.639
"Have you ever had
your boobs weighed?"

02:56.640 --> 03:00.320
And then pretend to... "Wahey!"

03:02.160 --> 03:03.320
It's a joke.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.640
You're good to go.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.560
Take paracetamol and apply

No, neither do I.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.360
She FaceTimed Lauren yesterday,
said she was in Wales.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.000
What... What was she doing
on the Isle of Man?

04:05.240 --> 04:06.959
I mean, it can't be her.

I don't know.
I couldn't get in touch with him.

'Neither could the police. That's...
That's why they called me.'

04:21.360 --> 04:25.359
Do you mean he doesn't know yet?
'No, I just rang you.'

04:25.360 --> 04:26.799
Well, he needs telling.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.919
I know he needs telling, Rosaline.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.399
'Well, I'm 200 miles away, Becca.'

04:31.400 --> 04:33.080
I can't do it over the phone.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.440
'I know. I'll go round.'

04:39.960 --> 04:43.399
They want us to ID the body.

Hello, love.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.680
It's Mum.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.880
Well... Well, they can't be sure,
can they?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.960
They can?
Well, they want us to...

05:46.080 --> 05:47.680
..identify the body.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.719
wasn't at the caravan in Wales
with Maureen?

06:15.720 --> 06:16.960
No.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.279
But did they change their plans
for some reason?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.000
No, no.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.000
Did Mum say she was going
to the Isle of Man?

06:29.440 --> 06:30.480
I don't know.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.600
I'm sorry. This is all too...

I can't go there.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.520
I'll make you a cup of tea.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.880
You're only going for a few days.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.199
Got shoes?
Er, yeah.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.239
And you're gonna wear your trainers
on the plane, yeah? Mm-hm.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.879
I can't leave your grandad
like this.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.919
He's gonna be fine. Don't worry.
Why won't he go with you?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.319
He said he wasn't able.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.840
Are you ready?
Yeah, nearly.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.000
Here, I'll do it.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.799
Stay on top of Mol. Jim?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.999
You've got to lay off her, Bec.
She's a teenager.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.199
She just has her moments.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.159
Being excluded from school's
quite a moment.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.360
Listen, I'll call you

07:54.080 --> 07:56.079
What was your mum doing over there?
I don't know.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.159
She was always with Dad or Maureen.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.239
Maybe this time she just
took herself off on her own.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.119
Why would me mum be on her own?
Dunno. Maybe they had a row.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.479
Me mum and dad have never had
an argument in their lives.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.760

13:57.760 --> 13:59.879
that is consistent

Will you be repatriating?

14:10.480 --> 14:11.720
Of course.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.079
How long was she on the beach
before she was found?

14:17.080 --> 14:21.159
Not long at all, we don't think.
She was meeting a friend for a walk.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.000
She had a friend here?

14:24.160 --> 14:27.240
He found her. He said
they walked the beach most days.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.879
Er, most days?
No, she's, erm...

14:31.880 --> 14:35.639
She sent me pictures
from just this week.

14:35.640 --> 14:41.319
Erm, one from Manchester,
then Wales, another one in Wales.

Have you got any?
May I?

That's not Wales. That's here. Peel.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.719
Why would she pretend
not to be here?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.199
Can we talk to this friend?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.320
His number's in the office.
Just a sec.

Oh, Dad.
I'll call him when we're done.

Is that... Is that near?

15:37.560 --> 15:40.839
Five or six miles.
A drive down the coast.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.319
I'll forward you the number
for repatriation.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.760
Thank you.
Is that it?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.439
Er, thank you for your help.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.519
If anything else comes up,
give either of us a call.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.519
No, she... We've just been told

15:54.520 --> 15:56.759
and we didn't know.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.479
Is that not weird to you?
I'm really sorry.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.759
The Coroner's role is to establish
how, what's, when and where,

16:03.760 --> 16:05.119
not why.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.120
Well, maybe you should stick
"why" on the list.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.239
Becca, as far as they're concerned,

16:16.240 --> 16:18.600
she's just a woman
who went for a walk and died.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.799
Oh. Just leave it.
What are we hoping to find?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.479
It'll just be photos she's sent you.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.759
She was pretending we're in Wales,
for whatever reason.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.519
You don't wanna know
what she was doing here

16:56.520 --> 16:57.719
and why she didn't tell us?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.159
Not massively, no.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.519
Wh...? Because you've got
to get back to work?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.959
No, because I don't like
picking at scabs.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.799
Yes, you do.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.559
Fine, right.
I like picking at scabs.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.159
No, I mean, you want to know
the same way that I want to know.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.639
You wanna know because
you don't like that you don't know.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.199
What I want
is to sort out getting Mum home

17:16.200 --> 17:18.079
and organising the funeral, OK?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.919
And that's what I want, too.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.040
Well, we're agreeing, then.
That isn't agreeing.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.560
Shall we agree to disagree?
I'd rather agree to agree.

Would you check on Dad for me?

18:28.720 --> 18:30.400
'Yeah. Yeah, of course I will.'
Bye.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.440
Everything OK?
Yeah. Mol's a bit...

18:36.680 --> 18:38.480
I think Jim's stressed.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.239
Mum told me
about what happened at school.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.519
I think they came down hard on her.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.279
Oh, well, I don't.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.079
Well, vaping. It's not crack, is it?
It's not the vaping.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.199
It's the kids that vape
that's the problem.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.239
Anyway, I'm not talking about that
with you.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.120
BECCA SIGHS

19:06.440 --> 19:07.800
Get your coat on.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.720
Where do you think they found her?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.080
What does it matter?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.280
I just hate thinking of her here
on her own.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.680
MAN: Bumper catch today.
Oh, you know me, I like 'em big.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.840
You weren't lying.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.279
Hello, Dad?

20:32.280 --> 20:33.320
DAD: 'Hello?'

20:34.960 --> 20:37.079
Dad, I just wanna ask you
what Mum was saying to you

20:37.080 --> 20:38.799
about being in Wales.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.239
'Er, Becca, look,
I'm busy now, love.'

20:41.240 --> 20:44.679
Oh, OK. It's just, well,
it's important, cos...

20:44.680 --> 20:47.639
Well, we know she was here
and not just yesterday.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.679
'We don't know why.
When did she leave, Dad?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.239
'When did you last see her?'

20:52.240 --> 20:56.239
Last week. Right, I will talk to you
about this later.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.519
Well...
Hi, Dad.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.319
Look, I'm in the process
of sorting repatriation.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.839
So if you know which
funeral director's you're using?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.679
Or we could sort that,
if you prefer.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.159
The one on the main drag
in Urmston.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.439
They seem professional.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.199
'Let me know
if you need me to do anything.'

21:11.200 --> 21:13.319
I will, love, I will.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.360
'Bye, Dad.'

21:15.760 --> 21:17.719
I just... I wanted to talk to him.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.119
Yeah, he clearly didn't wanna talk
to you, not about that.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.119
No. He couldn't get me off the phone
quick enough.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.239
Well, maybe he knew something
wasn't right.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.199
That's why he didn't come.
No, he would've said.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.400
Would he?

21:31.720 --> 21:33.879
Shall we just go to this place
she was staying

21:33.880 --> 21:37.879
and see if they know anything,
if she left anything?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.040
Yeah, OK.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.599
Hey.
Hello, ladies.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.519
Are you the only person
on the island with a taxi licence?

21:48.520 --> 21:50.000
Who said I had a licence?

22:31.440 --> 22:33.760
Is this a house? It's not a B&B?

22:35.080 --> 22:37.160
An old lady used to live up here
years ago.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.159
Me dad sold her a sheepdog.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.639
Well, that is fascinating (!)

22:42.640 --> 22:44.960
It's cash only, I'm afraid.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.159
What is this, the ark?

22:47.160 --> 22:49.839
Don't get your jetpack stuck
in the door on the way out, eh?

22:49.840 --> 22:52.480
I didn't mean to be rude.
Oh, I think we both know you did.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.840
Well, how do I pay, then?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.040
You owe me a pint.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.360
Thank you.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.960
Hello?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.840
Rosaline, what you doing?
Hello?

23:34.040 --> 23:36.000
Well, look, there's no-one home.
Let's just go.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.440
WHISPERS: Stop it!

23:46.360 --> 23:47.880
Well, we're not opening it.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.880
UNDER HER BREATH: Shit...

23:54.040 --> 23:55.800
Get off. Come on.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.880
WHISPERS: Ros...

24:22.320 --> 24:23.640
WHISPERS: Oh, my God...

25:45.320 --> 25:46.760
There's a load of junk down there.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.800
Who are all these people?

26:34.040 --> 26:35.879
She must have been here ages.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.319
She can't have been.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.599
Well, it doesn't look to me
like she met this lot last week

26:39.600 --> 26:42.319
and just popped to Boots
and had the pictures developed.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.519
And look at her hair in this one.
It's brown.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.199
It's been years
since she's had it brown.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.439
Right, this is ridiculous.
I'm calling Maureen.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.080
We've left her a message. She'll
call us back when she's ready.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.320
Mum clearly wasn't with her,
so maybe she's avoiding us. I would.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.519
Were Mum and Dad all right?

27:02.520 --> 27:03.760
Yeah.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.720
Well, yeah. Well, I think so.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.960
How often did you see her?

27:11.240 --> 27:16.039
Every couple of weeks.
But... I mean, we've been busy.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.160
But... But we spoke, though.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.120
So she could've been here
and not told you?

27:31.480 --> 27:35.440
All right, Richard?
I, uh, I've brought you these.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.400
Oh, erm, thank you.

27:41.280 --> 27:45.079
I... I can help you put 'em away.
Oh, no, no, no.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.760
I'm fine, thanks, Jim.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.999
Anything else
that you think you'll need, or...?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.920
No, not really.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.479
Look, Richard.

27:57.480 --> 28:02.359
Look, I... I'm really sorry.
Gutted, in fact. We all are.

28:02.360 --> 28:07.160
Yeah, well, you know...
can't be helped.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.759
She's double-folding tin foil.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.679
Making a lovely life for herself,
pretending she's in bloody Anglesey.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.960
OK, good.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.959
Well, shall we call
this Pete bloke again?

28:33.960 --> 28:36.520
Yeah. Let's call this Pete bloke
again.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.600
What's his second name?
Ribeiro.

28:50.320 --> 28:54.360
No, no answer.
I've got his address.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.600
You'd have no real need
for the internet, would you?

29:01.040 --> 29:04.519
Ah.
I've left you a number of messages.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.280
Oh. Well, you know I never listen
to voicemails.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.000
Mary's daughters
are here on the island.

29:15.440 --> 29:19.359
I'll go say hi.
That's it? You'll go say hi?

29:19.360 --> 29:23.279
What do you want me to say?
Perhaps some respect?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.759
Oh, I get it.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.079
You want me
to do full-out Queen Victoria.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.959
Hundred years of mourning.
Where is my veil?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.879
They're her daughters, Cathy.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.399
I just wanna know
what we should tell them.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.920
You do whatever you think is best.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.519
What are you gonna say?

29:37.520 --> 29:39.280
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.879
HE SIGHS

30:18.880 --> 30:23.760
Hello... Becca and Rosaline.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.399
I've heard all about you.
Please come...

30:27.400 --> 30:29.680
Well, we haven't heard about you.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.160
How long have you known Mum?
How long has she been here?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.559
Well, I...

30:36.560 --> 30:40.039
I first met your mum
at the writing group that she ran.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.319
Mum ran a writing group?
So you found her?

30:42.320 --> 30:48.159
Yes. Erm, I'd, er,
I'd gone to meet her for a walk.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.000
How well did you know her?

30:52.200 --> 30:53.320
Your mother...

30:54.960 --> 30:56.879
..she was a good friend to me.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.959
She never mentioned you.
Were you having an affair?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.079
My God, Rosaline!

31:00.080 --> 31:02.679
He said he went for a walk.
I'm just asking.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.159
Sorry.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.279
I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.599
Well, how often was she here?
Would you please just leave?

31:08.600 --> 31:11.400
Could we talk tomorrow, maybe?
Yeah, yeah. Fine, fine.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.359
Why would you go straight to affair?

31:17.360 --> 31:18.439
Yeah, well, sorry.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.959
Just thought I'd mention
any potential elephants in the room.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.199
Why has there got to be an elephant?
She wouldn't do that.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.599
Well, we didn't know Mum
would be hanging pictures on a wall

31:26.600 --> 31:28.760
in the Isle of Man
till two days ago.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.560
"Pass me my readers, Richard."

31:45.000 --> 31:46.319
BECCA CHUCKLES

31:46.320 --> 31:48.159
Remember when they shared
one pair of glasses

31:48.160 --> 31:49.279
for about five years?

31:49.280 --> 31:52.119
Yeah. You marched them both
to the optician, didn't you?

31:52.120 --> 31:53.639
Yes, I did.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.479
And Mum memorised the bottom line.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.599
The optician saw her come in
and switched the cards round.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.159
She got herself in such a flap.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.280
She needed bloody jam jars,
not readers.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.880
Did she tell you that?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.160
No. You told me
when you were staying with me.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.840
Oh, yeah.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.999
Oh, look. "Dear Mrs Ward,
thank you for your time today.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.639
"If there's anything else
you require,

32:24.640 --> 32:27.399
"do not hesitate to contact us."

32:27.400 --> 32:29.080
It's from a solicitor's.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.280
I'll call them.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.440
BECCA SNIFFS
It's her perfume.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.519
Oh, God.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.119
If you wanna go back,
I can sort stuff here.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.239
No, I don't want to leave you here.
I'm just...

32:45.240 --> 32:47.880
BECCA SIGHS
I'm...

33:25.960 --> 33:28.040
Ros. Hey.

33:30.520 --> 33:35.159
Huh! Remember this?
You taught me how to do this.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.319
Oh!

33:37.320 --> 33:39.119
OK.
Argh!

33:39.120 --> 33:40.399
ROSALINE PANTS

33:40.400 --> 33:43.199
Argh!
Oh, she's lost her touch!

33:43.200 --> 33:45.039
My feet aren't as sweaty as yours.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.319
It's nothing to do with the fact

33:46.320 --> 33:48.479
that I'm the best wall climber
in the family?

33:48.480 --> 33:51.119
Oh, are ya? Are ya?

33:51.120 --> 33:53.519
No, no, don't you dare!
No, not the fanny!

33:53.520 --> 33:54.720
Wah!

33:56.800 --> 33:59.759
BECCA SNORTS
Ha!

33:59.760 --> 34:02.839
Stop!
BOTH SNORT

34:02.840 --> 34:05.480
I'm gonna wee myself!

34:09.920 --> 34:12.199
Oh, God.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.960
BECCA GIGGLES,
THEN SIGHS

34:16.640 --> 34:18.159
Where'd you get this?

34:18.160 --> 34:21.519
Uh... Uh...

34:21.520 --> 34:23.319
It's Mum's necklace.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.320
That she never took off.
Where'd you get it from?

34:28.160 --> 34:29.239
She wore this every day.

34:29.240 --> 34:30.879
It's not yours
to just squirrel away.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.199
What are you bothered for?
It's from Argos.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.719
Are you for real?

34:34.720 --> 34:37.439
I bought the first one
for Mother's Day when I was 12.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.719
Yeah. And I bought the second one.
Yeah, I took you on the bus to town.

34:40.720 --> 34:43.279
It's not yours to just have,
but you don't think like that.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.839
What does that mean?
It means you think

34:44.840 --> 34:47.039
you and Mum were tight,
so you get to take what you want.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.639
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

34:49.640 --> 34:53.639
Where's all this coming from?
Are you joking?

34:53.640 --> 34:55.839
Oh, my God.
Because we looked after you?

34:55.840 --> 34:58.119
Oh, you two
and your fucking cult of caring.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.839
What?

34:59.840 --> 35:02.879
"Oh, don't take me back there.
I can't cope with my sick daughter.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.479
"It was so traumatic for me."

35:04.480 --> 35:05.999
So you take over, and Mum's all,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.079
"Becca, you've done
such a great job."

35:08.080 --> 35:09.279
It wasn't like that.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.919
Well, no-one asked you
to look after me.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.559
No, I know they didn't.
No-one needed to.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.559
Cos you're such a saint.
No, because I'm your sister.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.280
Well, next time,
don't fucking bother.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.000
BECCA SIGHS

35:31.040 --> 35:32.360
CAR DOOR SHUTS

35:42.760 --> 35:45.759
Hey. How you doing?
Ah, you know.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.240
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
OK, just one minute.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.719
Here you go.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.159
Oh, thanks very much.
Here you are.

36:18.160 --> 36:21.559
Now, listen, you call me
if you need anything, right?

36:21.560 --> 36:23.120
All right?
Yeah, yep.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.559
Sorry. It took me a while
to locate the file.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.120
So... the house at Bayview
was your mother's.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.199
As in she owned it?
It's all here.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.400
We haven't got any money
in our family.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.759
And she's given instruction

36:52.760 --> 36:56.800
for it to be left to Rosaline Ward
and Becca Hall in trust.

36:58.160 --> 37:02.399
It says it is for the betterment
of the women of the family.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.560
What does that mean?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.440
That's all it says.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.319
What does "trust" mean?
Well, a trust is...

37:10.320 --> 37:11.600
It means we can't sell it.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.760
Look what we could've won.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.800
No change out of a million.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.359
That's the first thing
you think of doing?

37:26.360 --> 37:28.679
Looking up the price?
Don't give me that.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.040
What you gonna do?
Give it to the local cats' home?

37:33.760 --> 37:37.040
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
We can't sell the thing.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.560
Who the fuck was she?

37:49.680 --> 37:52.000
Well, she was Mum.
Yeah, but who was that?

37:53.560 --> 37:55.399
Cos that's not the woman who...

37:55.400 --> 37:58.359
let Dad tell his stories
while she laughed politely.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.199
Or was bothered
about what people thought of her.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.360
Or went bright red
if she even told a white lie.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.759
Well, maybe this is all so big
she couldn't tell us.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.599
Or maybe
she was just massively selfish

38:11.600 --> 38:12.960
and we hadn't realised.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.120
Hello. Rosaline, Becca.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.359
I am so sorry for your loss.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.400
Pete called me.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.040
I'm Cathy.
I'm a dear friend of your mother's.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.599
Must have been a terrible shock.
Thank you.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.519
Hoo, she'll never be dead
while you're alive.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.200
You have the exact same nose.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.320
Well, let's have at it.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.239
I'm sorry your mother
was so closed off

38:57.240 --> 38:59.439
about her experience here.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.959
That's one way of putting it.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.479
Another way of putting it
is I was no fan of her dishonesty.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.719
I like things out in the open.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.399
I told her,
"Just rip off the band-aid.

39:09.400 --> 39:13.319
"Call your father. Call the girls."
And I'm sure she meant to.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.999
So what WAS she doing here?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.600
She was looking for her mother.

39:19.640 --> 39:23.920
Gran? She died... 20 years ago?

39:25.280 --> 39:28.000
Her real mother.
Your mom was adopted.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.720
Er, no, she wasn't.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.040
And she found her. Her mother.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.159
Joan Corrigan.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.400
Oh, wait. Wait just one minute.
I'll be right back.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.680
There they are.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.639
Joan had your mother
just at the end of World War Two.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.879
She'd fallen in love
with a German Jewish musician

40:04.880 --> 40:07.799
who was in an internment camp
nearby.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.679
And, well... it was a whole thing,

40:10.680 --> 40:13.360
and they wouldn't let her
keep the baby.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.759
Did she ever say anything to you
about this?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.760
No, she didn't.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.080
This is Joan's house.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.360
She left it to your mother
when she died.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.159
Well, I think you have
a lot to process.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.079
Sorry. When was all this?

40:32.080 --> 40:37.639
Oh, um, 2015. Yeah, 2015.
What?

40:37.640 --> 40:41.720
Sorry. She... She's been coming here
for eight years?

40:44.080 --> 40:46.959
Becca?
What, I didn't...

40:46.960 --> 40:49.479
We-We knew nothing about this,
cos she...

40:49.480 --> 40:52.359
she was at home with Dad,
and then she would be with me.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.520
Do you think your mother
was a people pleaser?

40:56.080 --> 41:01.519
I mean... she waited until
your grandmother in Manchester died

41:01.520 --> 41:03.559
before she even started looking
for her mother.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.120
So she came here, found her.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.599
And it was great to get to know her,

41:10.600 --> 41:13.999
but she felt disloyalty to you two.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.639
And also, when you found out,

41:15.640 --> 41:18.159
you'd find out
that she'd been lying.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.399
That's not an excuse.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.319
Oh, I'm right there with you, honey.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.479
Look, look,
I'll just give you girls some time.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.560
Erm...

41:28.760 --> 41:30.399
..here's my number.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.280
Please, if you need anything...

41:33.400 --> 41:35.439
Could I just use your bathroom?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.080
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.640
Well, you know how to reach me.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.200
This is all bullshit.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.000
I need you to see something.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.480
Do you know
how many Sunday dinners I've made?

42:51.400 --> 42:57.159
Or... how many times
I've popped to Aldi for some bits?

42:57.160 --> 43:00.399
Or the trips I've done
to Dunelm Mill?

43:00.400 --> 43:02.199
You're not...
And the amount of inane drivel

43:02.200 --> 43:05.439
I've had talked in my ear
by Mum about neighbours

43:05.440 --> 43:07.559
or Dad's gout or the...

43:07.560 --> 43:10.879
the stent that so-and-so
had to put in down the road.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.400
And not once
has she mentioned any of this.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.880
I get it, Becca. She lied to us.
No, no, Rosaline, she lied to me!

43:21.160 --> 43:22.800
Oh, there she is. She lied to you.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.440
Found these.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.760
I'll have a Vimto Martini
straight up, thanks. Hold the olive.

43:55.240 --> 43:59.279
Urgh. Argh. It's disgusting.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.800
Oh, God!

44:02.880 --> 44:04.879
Do you think she sat here
and thought,

44:04.880 --> 44:08.959
"Oh, the girls would love it here.
Best not tell 'em."?

44:08.960 --> 44:10.440
BECCA CHUCKLES

44:13.080 --> 44:14.600
I miss you, you know.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.200
No, you don't.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.000
Oh, OK. I don't, then.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.079
Can you believe our grandparents
aren't our grandparents?

44:28.080 --> 44:30.720
Uh...? Pfft!

44:32.160 --> 44:35.360
Yeah, it would've been handy
to know she was adopted.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.040
Medically speaking, maybe.

44:54.520 --> 44:55.920
Should we just stay here tonight?

44:57.240 --> 44:58.280
Yeah.

45:05.640 --> 45:08.680
I'll sleep in the spare bed.
It's not made up.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.840
Shall we top and tail?

45:48.080 --> 45:50.600
