WEBVTT

00:06.939 --> 00:08.274
[cheering]

00:10.677 --> 00:13.380
[Tiki] Just three daring souls
have taken on...

00:13.446 --> 00:14.681
He's gonna make it.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.183
...and taken down the Beast.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.318
And he gets it.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.987
The others, battered, bloody...

00:22.222 --> 00:23.990
and bounced from the competition.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.059
[Chris] Oh, my goodness!

00:26.126 --> 00:28.928
[Tiki] Tonight, one more
will see their dream...

00:29.396 --> 00:30.263
shattered.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.766
-[Tiki and Chris] Oh!
-[Chris] Oh, she's in pain.

00:32.832 --> 00:33.666
[screams]

00:33.733 --> 00:35.802
-[Chris] She's trying to go, here.
-[Tiki] Wow!

00:35.869 --> 00:39.005
[Serena] I will not stop.
I'll go on, even with a broken leg.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.775
[Tiki] This could be disastrous for her.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.911
Oh, my Lord!

00:45.378 --> 00:46.980
[theme music playing]

00:53.853 --> 00:55.688
[cheering]

00:55.755 --> 00:57.690
[Tiki] Somebody call the National Guard

00:57.757 --> 01:01.761
because that thing is about to unleash
some serious destruction.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.330
[Chris] I honestly do not think
my insurance can cover that.

01:04.763 --> 01:08.735
Hello, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber
and joining me is Chris Distefano.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.770
Tonight, 12 new competitors

01:10.837 --> 01:15.742
will try to take the world's
most destructive obstacle course by storm.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.778
One of them is going to bank $10,000

01:18.845 --> 01:21.281
and the title of tonight's Beastmaster.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.382
Showtime!

01:22.449 --> 01:24.684
USA! USA!

01:24.751 --> 01:26.619
[Chris] We've crowned three finalists.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.055
Six more spots are up for grabs.

01:29.122 --> 01:32.325
Who will lay claim to their shot
at the grand prize tonight?

01:32.392 --> 01:35.528
[Tiki] And, Chris, we've got
two badass American competitors,

01:35.595 --> 01:37.564
so the US is in good hands.

01:38.164 --> 01:41.334
At 19 years old, Brian
is the youngest competitor going tonight,

01:41.401 --> 01:44.437
but he's confident and ready to prove
that age is just a number.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.807
I've been doing parkour
for probably about three years.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.010
I've been out there training.
I think I have what it takes.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.546
And winning this course would be amazing.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.483
That would be one of the biggest things
to ever happen to me.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.253
[Tiki] Alex Picazo is a former
all-American wrestler from Ohio State

02:00.320 --> 02:03.189
and coached
the 2016 Olympic gold medalist.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.792
Tonight, we'll see
if the superstar from OSU

02:05.859 --> 02:07.961
can take down the Beast for Team USA.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.864
[Alex] I'm always looking for new ways
to push myself.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.132
Competition drives me.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.435
That's why I'm here
and excited to be repping Team USA.

02:15.502 --> 02:18.138
I can't wait to go out there
and make the country proud.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.342
[Tiki] Let's kick it off.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.711
Level 1 is underway.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.414
Tonight's competition features a battle

02:28.481 --> 02:33.453
between three of the world's
top female obstacle course racers,

02:33.520 --> 02:38.925
including our first competitor,
2016 champ, TJ García from Spain.

02:41.528 --> 02:45.732
She's a physiotherapist, CrossFit trainer,
and has a seven-year-old daughter.

02:45.798 --> 02:48.134
So that's one bad momma right there.

02:48.201 --> 02:51.905
This is important for me because it's
both a physical and mental challenge.

02:51.971 --> 02:54.407
And I want to see
if I'm capable of overcoming it.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.543
I will defeat the Beast!

02:59.479 --> 03:00.947
[Tiki] Alright, here we go.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.350
This girl also has an incredible physique.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.955
She started competing when
she was just four. Sports are her life.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.426
[Tiki] Remember,
there is a six-minute time limit.

03:13.493 --> 03:17.063
[Chris] She's a working mom, so she'll
be thinking, "There's never enough time,"

03:17.130 --> 03:19.299
but in Spanish.

03:19.632 --> 03:23.136
[Tiki] Not only is TJ competing
for her girlfriend and daughter back home,

03:23.203 --> 03:28.241
she wants to show the world that
even a mom can get it on with the Beast.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.010
Now, this is the second
of the jumps over the Grinder.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.378
You've got to think about

03:32.645 --> 03:34.814
and execute this jump.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.450
Gather yourself and jump!
And she made it.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.557
You've got to move very quickly.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.762
[all] Yeah!

03:51.898 --> 03:55.468
[Tiki] Taking on the Faceplant.
Again, this is all about confidence.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.104
Because you're staring
at that chain in front of you.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.305
All you've got to do...

03:59.872 --> 04:01.040
is hold on to that chain,

04:01.107 --> 04:02.842
but you've got to grab it high.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.280
Great catching of the chain there by TJ.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.417
But she still has to make the transfer
to the Energy Coil.

04:11.484 --> 04:14.587
Now, CrossFit athletes
are used to hanging.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.822
But they do repetitive pull-ups.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.158
Hanging from the chain
was no obstacle for her.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.793
-How many pull-ups can you do in a row?
-30.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.429
-I've done 31.
-[Tiki] Nice.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.334
Bravo! Wonderful!

04:28.401 --> 04:30.069
-She knows her stuff.
-Wonderful!

04:30.136 --> 04:32.005
Our Spanish girl is unbelievable!

04:32.605 --> 04:36.209
[Chris] Ouch!
That just put the pain in Spain!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.411
[Tiki] Here's the thing...
Here's the trouble...

04:38.845 --> 04:40.480
Chris, she's got to do it again.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.682
She's wasting some precious time.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.553
-Oh, she got it!
-And she got it!

04:48.655 --> 04:50.123
Look how excited she is.

04:50.189 --> 04:53.226
-Great! Come on!
-Awesome!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.495
-Great!
-Come on!

04:55.962 --> 04:58.398
Come on, champion! Come on!

04:59.065 --> 05:01.401
[Tiki] She's got 50 points
at this juncture.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.136
[cheering]

05:06.306 --> 05:08.675
[Tiki] Now, 55 points.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.010
This is the farthest
we've seen a female go.

05:11.077 --> 05:11.911
[Chris] Yes.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.549
[Tiki] One minute and thirty seconds
left on the clock.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.356
She's got to pick up the pace.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.927
After this one,
the jump should get a bit easier.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.495
She goes shoulder-first

05:29.562 --> 05:32.398
into the pole of that Energy Coil.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.134
She knows time is working against her.

05:37.036 --> 05:40.606
As she gets closer. 30 seconds. Come on!

05:40.673 --> 05:43.276
One more jump
and then she's on to the Sling Shot.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.348
Look how excited she is.

05:48.414 --> 05:52.819
75 points for TJ at this point
as she goes for the Sling Shot.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.021
Further than any woman.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.291
-Very good! That's incredible!
-Come on! Yes! Yes!

05:58.358 --> 06:02.762
[Chris and Tiki]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

06:02.829 --> 06:08.267
five, four, three, two, one.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.403
-[Tiki] Time's up!
-[Chris] She ran out of time.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.839
[Tiki] What an unbelievable effort!

06:12.905 --> 06:14.040
Well done!

06:15.341 --> 06:17.143
-She's great.
-Just like a champion.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.414
[Tiki] All of the Spaniards bowing down
to TJ García.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.384
Fantastic, fantastic effort.

06:24.450 --> 06:29.422
Now watch these jumps. She lands
solidly on her abs every single time.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.592
-That does not feel good.
-[Chris] Right in the pelvic floor.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.962
[Tiki] But as she got on later,
those jumps get shorter.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.264
She flexes her muscles.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.501
To all the women in the world -
we can do it.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.436
If we want to, we can do it. Honestly.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.442
[Chris] Next up, from China,
we have Fang Jianguo.

06:49.509 --> 06:52.445
And Fang Jianguo
is actually a physical therapist.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.946
So we have that in common.

06:54.013 --> 06:55.114
Chinese Kung Fu!

06:55.181 --> 06:57.950
[Tiki] He is a professional rock climber.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.052
[Chris] Wow, we don't have that in common.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.187
[Tiki laughs]

07:03.289 --> 07:05.958
[Fang] You're looking
at a perfect version of me.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.060
I used to have a lot of weaknesses,

07:08.861 --> 07:11.764
so I was bullied a lot by my classmates.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.101
My PE teacher told me that
I wasn't suited to physical activities.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.771
When I went to college,
I discovered rock climbing.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.407
I want to thank my coach, Jiao-Tian,

07:21.474 --> 07:22.575
for discovering me.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.078
I asked him,

07:26.145 --> 07:28.748
"Can I train with you?"

07:28.815 --> 07:33.186
He looked at me and said,
"OK. You're not that bad."

07:33.252 --> 07:39.325
After three years, he got lung cancer
and he passed away in May the year after.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.694
The best way to repay his kindness

07:41.761 --> 07:46.699
is to do my very best to win this,
and be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.740
[Tiki] Now, he's running this course
tonight in honor of his coach,

07:54.807 --> 07:58.578
who unfortunately passed away,
so a deeper meaning.

08:02.548 --> 08:06.686
Jianguo is motoring through
the obstacle course.

08:06.752 --> 08:07.887
Grinder...

08:08.321 --> 08:10.223
down in pretty quick time.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.959
Jianguo Fang, you can do it!

08:13.025 --> 08:14.360
Jianguo Fang, you can do it!

08:16.863 --> 08:19.332
She's crazy. She's crazy more than me.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.267
I'm a crazy girl.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.470
[Tiki] Jianguo already on Faceplant.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.205
He's wasting no time.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.779
He holds on easily.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.313
[Chris] No problem.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.520
He claims he has strong forearms
so he always does this pose.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.154
He always does this.

08:42.221 --> 08:46.058
[Tiki] He's trying to figure out the best
way to make this ten-plus-foot jump.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.227
[Chris] And he held on!

08:48.995 --> 08:50.596
He held on to it.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.164
China! China!

08:53.966 --> 08:55.902
[Tiki] He just hangs on!

08:55.968 --> 08:58.204
That's the benefit
of being a rock climber.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.874
As you can see,
he got pounded into his chest.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.544
[Chris] He's flexing his biceps,
letting us know he's OK.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.079
And that he works out.

09:07.780 --> 09:08.881
[Tiki] Quick recovery

09:09.415 --> 09:10.249
for Jianguo.

09:16.789 --> 09:19.959
[Tiki] Now he's looking
at that Point Thruster

09:20.026 --> 09:21.494
to see if he can get it.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.829
Chinese Kung Fu!

09:23.896 --> 09:25.131
[Tiki] I like Jianguo.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.166
You have the strongest forearms! Go!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.801
Let's do this!

09:33.172 --> 09:35.541
[Tiki] He passed up the Point Thruster
right there.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.744
-[Chris] He went quick!
-[Tiki] He has no fear.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.379
[Chris] He's going to the Sling Shot.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.915
He basically said,
"I'm gonna fly through this."

09:42.982 --> 09:45.084
-Say, "You can do it."
-You can do it.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.720
You can do it!

09:47.787 --> 09:49.755
-OK.
-You can do it!

09:49.822 --> 09:52.291
You can do it.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.759
[Tiki] Just makes it!

09:54.260 --> 09:57.330
He has it irregularly,
as he's twisting you can see...

09:57.396 --> 10:00.199
-He lands it!
-[Chris] He made a perfect landing.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.936
[Tiki] He landed that one.
I thought he was going to fly forward.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.472
He's got 85 points at this point.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.841
He has to get this moving back and forth

10:08.908 --> 10:14.246
so he can get some momentum from
the Crash Pad to get onto the next one.

10:14.313 --> 10:18.117
He's tilting it forward though,
which makes it a little more difficult...

10:18.184 --> 10:19.986
[commentators groan]

10:20.453 --> 10:23.189
-I think he's going to the finals.
-It hurts.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.523
The strongest forearms.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.959
[Chris] Jianguo Fang gave it all he could.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.594
[Tiki] 85 points.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.896
He is the leader in the clubhouse.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.666
Actually, I thought I could reach it.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.934
It wasn't so far.

10:35.001 --> 10:40.272
But maybe I didn't use all of my strength,
so I didn't give enough.

10:40.706 --> 10:44.143
Next time, I will win!
I will win the game!

10:44.210 --> 10:45.444
OK, thank you.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.951
[Tiki] Now here's the second of tonight's
top OCR stars - Serena Jura from Italy.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.887
She's a member of the Italian OCR team.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.924
My family is the joy of my life,

10:58.991 --> 11:00.192
my happiness.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.863
I entered the sporting world
when I was 30,

11:03.929 --> 11:06.198
and I proved that, even at that age,

11:06.265 --> 11:08.934
with three children, a family and a job,

11:09.001 --> 11:13.606
you can absolutely
still believe in your dreams

11:13.673 --> 11:15.074
and fuel your passion.

11:15.141 --> 11:19.145
Personally, I will take on this challenge

11:19.211 --> 11:21.180
by giving it everything I've got.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.515
I will not stop.

11:22.581 --> 11:26.352
I know myself,
and I know that I will not stop.

11:28.721 --> 11:32.792
[Chris] Serena Jura onto Grinder.
Didn't have any problems there.

11:35.561 --> 11:39.498
[Tiki] It's about six feet
between Grinder.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.502
Serena taking her time.

11:43.569 --> 11:47.907
[Chris] She said she used to fear
everything, and now she fears nothing.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.777
[Tiki] Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:51.844 --> 11:52.912
Ouch!

11:53.379 --> 11:54.513
That hurts!

11:54.580 --> 11:57.783
[Tiki] I think she hyper-extended
her knee.

11:58.317 --> 12:01.187
This could be disastrous for her.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.322
[Chris] Let's see, which knee is it?

12:03.389 --> 12:04.490
[Chris groans]

12:05.224 --> 12:08.427
-[Chris] She's in pain.
-[Tiki] I've seen that so many times.

12:09.762 --> 12:12.198
When you have
that massive pain in your knee.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.867
-[Chris] She's trying to go.
-[Tiki] She's trying.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.569
[Chris] Serena is trying to go.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.871
Serena's trying to get five more points.

12:18.938 --> 12:22.007
-She's great!
-Go, Serena, go!

12:22.675 --> 12:25.611
She is in pain, but she won't stop!

12:29.081 --> 12:33.185
[Tiki] We will know after this jump
whether that knee has any support left...

12:33.252 --> 12:36.789
-[Chris] And it does!
-[Tiki] Clearly, she's in a lot of pain.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.058
[Chris] This girl is inspiring.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.794
Your daughters are proud of you, Serena!

12:41.861 --> 12:44.597
Come on, Serena!

12:44.663 --> 12:45.698
She's a warrior!

12:45.765 --> 12:48.601
-She's great!
-She's a warrior! Never give up!

12:48.667 --> 12:51.771
She's giving me goose pimples.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.973
[Tiki] This is actually pretty amazing.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.810
Most people will lay down at adversity.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.050
[Chris] Serena! Serena!

13:06.619 --> 13:08.821
She said she hoped
to inspire her daughters.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.190
This is the most
inspirational thing I've seen.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.992
[Tiki] She's got 25 points right now.

13:13.058 --> 13:17.363
If she jumps and holds on
to this chain off of Faceplant...

13:17.429 --> 13:18.697
[Chris] Serena!

13:19.098 --> 13:21.600
[commentators groan]

13:22.168 --> 13:23.869
-Oh, well...
-Serena's gone!

13:23.936 --> 13:26.739
She's still a warrior.
Seriously, well done.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.741
Well done, to a real warrior lady.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.010
-I'm so sad for her.
-Incredible.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.945
[Bianca] She was great!

13:33.012 --> 13:35.381
In spite of all her pain.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.116
[Chris] Amazing!

13:37.183 --> 13:39.485
-She kept going.
-[Bianca] She's a fighter.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.655
-She's a fighter.
-She hurt her knee. Look at that.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.858
[Chris] Let's hope she's OK.
Let's hope it's just a knee sprain.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.093
Hyper-extension grade one.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.764
[man] These guys will carry you there.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.499
[Chris] Yeah, she can't put weight on it.

13:53.566 --> 13:57.636
So that actually does tell me
that there could potentially be a tear,

13:57.703 --> 14:01.207
because the ACL
restricts the tibia from moving forward.

14:01.273 --> 14:02.808
It looked like it flailed out.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.712
[Tiki] Chris is not just blowing hot air.
This is what he was trained to do.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.915
I was a physical therapist,
and now I'm a clown.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.719
The one thing that I'm known for

14:14.320 --> 14:16.322
is the fact that I never give up.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.357
That's the real victory,

14:18.424 --> 14:21.927
when you prove
what you're really made of.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.629
And I'm made of steel.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.999
I bend, I may break a little,

14:27.066 --> 14:28.734
but I am made of steel.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.573
[Tiki] Valentin already on the Faceplant.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.275
25 points.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.478
And he's off!
First place for Valentin!

14:41.000 --> 14:47.074

14:49.922 --> 14:51.857
[Tiki] He grabs the chain easily.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.795
Onto the Energy Coil. He is going...

14:58.163 --> 15:00.132
for the extra Point Thruster.

15:00.199 --> 15:04.103
He's long. At six-one,
those Point Thrusters are easy.

15:07.273 --> 15:10.743
Jumping back has been the issue.
He does it again with ease.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.812
He's got another ten foot jump
to get to the next Energy Coil.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.482
Rocking the man bun.

15:16.548 --> 15:20.586
Confidently jumping
from Energy Coil to Energy Coil.

15:20.653 --> 15:24.156
Valentin collecting himself.
Yes, and he makes it!

15:24.223 --> 15:26.992
Now he made that
look easier than it actually is.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.728
He's got some explosion
in those long legs.

15:31.931 --> 15:36.001
-Come on, Valentin!
-Go, Valentin!

15:37.870 --> 15:41.674
Go on, you're there! It's to the side!

15:43.876 --> 15:47.446
[Tiki] Let's see if he can get this Point
Thruster with an easy jump and touch.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.381
He does not even attempt it.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.154
That's it! Carry on!

16:00.025 --> 16:01.460
[Chris] He's on to the Sling Shot.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.999
You have to land like a starfish
to keep your balance.

16:07.066 --> 16:10.402
-Come on, be SpongeBob.
-Let go on the next swing!

16:10.469 --> 16:13.305
[Tiki] The more that you hang on
to that trapeze,

16:13.372 --> 16:15.040
that Sling Shot, the harder the jump.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.710
-[Chris] Let go!
-[Tiki] He doesn't make it.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.311
[Tiki] Head-first dive.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.348
-No!
-No, no, no!

16:22.414 --> 16:24.083
Ouch! Ouch!

16:24.149 --> 16:29.655
Let's bring the poor French a pizza!

16:30.789 --> 16:34.293
A delivery from Italy - a pizza.

16:37.062 --> 16:37.896
Lovely!

16:37.963 --> 16:40.132
Truth is, it's poisoned.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.167
How nice of them.
It's very nice of them.

16:42.234 --> 16:46.005
[Tiki] As you can see, Level 1 is serving
up competitors for the Beast tonight,

16:46.071 --> 16:49.208
and the Beast, he's chewing at the pieces.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.611
Now let's take a look at some highlights
of five more competitors

16:52.678 --> 16:54.913
as they attempted to conquer Level 1.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.617
Raúl Beltrán,
a navy search and rescuer from Spain,

16:58.684 --> 17:00.919
was on a mission
to take down the Beast.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.290
He failed to hit the Point Thruster
heading to the Sling Shot.

17:07.159 --> 17:10.362
-[Chris] He tried.
-[Tiki] And ultimately washed out.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.932
-No! So soon!
-No! No! No!

17:16.335 --> 17:18.404
[Tiki] Italy's Matteo Della Bordella...

17:20.172 --> 17:24.009
was ready to use his mountain climbing
skills to put the Beast on the ropes.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.676
-Yeah!
-Perfect!

17:25.743 --> 17:30.015
[Tiki] Then, he got absolutely rocked
on the Sling Shot.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.750
[Bianca groans]

17:31.817 --> 17:33.619
Matteo!

17:34.620 --> 17:39.191
[Tiki] Sandra Large from France, the last
of tonight's top female OCR stars,

17:39.258 --> 17:41.060
powered her way through the Grinder.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.600
But ran out of steam on Faceplant.

17:50.269 --> 17:53.205
Our first American,
wrestling coach Alex Picazo...

17:53.272 --> 17:55.174
-Oossaa!
-Oossaa!

17:55.240 --> 17:56.075
Buckle up!

17:56.141 --> 17:58.077
[Tiki] ...was ready to take down Level 1.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.279
-Yes, he makes it!
-[Chris] Did you see how he flew?

18:00.345 --> 18:01.814
He almost went through it.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.451
[commentators groan]

18:05.918 --> 18:08.253
[Tiki] But got body slammed
on the Energy Coils.

18:09.154 --> 18:13.158
India's Ritesh Shaiwal,
who was a gym manager and mountaineer,

18:13.225 --> 18:16.028
was ready to show Level 1
what he was made of.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.330
[Chris] Oh!

18:18.397 --> 18:21.366
-Victory to Mother India!
-Victory!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.267
[Tiki] However,

18:22.334 --> 18:26.205
he spent too much time working the crowd,
rather than working the Beast.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.942
-[Chris] He's waving goodbye to the crowd.
-[Tiki] He timed out with just 80 points.

18:30.476 --> 18:34.079
The Frenchman, Valentin Dubois,
leads with 95 points,

18:34.146 --> 18:37.249
followed by all-American wrestler,
Alex Picazo.

18:37.316 --> 18:41.253
Sandra Large of France now finds herself
on the bubble in eighth place

18:41.320 --> 18:46.658
and sadly, Serena Jura from Italy becomes
the first athlete eliminated tonight.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.463
Up next, Indian architect Mujahid Habib.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.134
-Wow, with a somersault!
-And now we're impressed!

18:55.534 --> 18:57.469
[Tiki] He makes it to Faceplant.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.772
But all he's got to do is land this jump,

19:01.673 --> 19:04.843
and Sandra Large will be knocked out.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.913
His advantage, though, is that he's tall,

19:07.980 --> 19:11.183
so all he has to do is grab high enough
on this chain and swing over.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.851
[Chris] Which he did, no problem.

19:12.918 --> 19:17.990
[Tiki] And with that,
Sandra Large is now eliminated.

19:18.056 --> 19:22.794
Let's not forget,
he is a national parkour champion.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.496
Mujahid, Mujahid, Mujahid.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.165
We were hoping to not see this.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.699
-Come on!
-Easy. Focus.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.769
[Tiki] At six feet, this jump back
should be relatively easy.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.539
Out of the Indian competitors,

19:33.605 --> 19:38.710
this is the one that feels like
we're watching an athlete with confidence.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.513
[Chris] Wow. No wonder this guy
is an architect.

19:41.580 --> 19:45.050
If you were designing the perfect
Beastmaster athlete, he'd be it.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.354
[Tiki] When you're six feet tall,
you can leap off of one leg.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.192
Which obviously gives you much more reach.

19:53.258 --> 19:57.262
[Chris] Mujahid Habib really
doing very well for India right now.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.799
[Tiki] These Energy Coils
are going to be no challenge at all.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.136
-Yes, Mujahid.
-Mujahid! Mujahid!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.271
[Chris] He got through the hardest one,
so now,

20:06.338 --> 20:08.507
it should be a cakewalk
to the Sling Shot.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.376
[Tiki] Unless he falters
trying to get the Point Thruster.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.312
He almost had it!

20:15.113 --> 20:18.150
One minute and thirty seconds
left on the clock.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.484
Shall we go down? Come on.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.390
[crowd] Victory to India!
Victory to India!

20:25.891 --> 20:28.026
[Tiki] He is tied for the lead right now

20:28.093 --> 20:29.361
with 95 points.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.497
All he has to do is land this jump.

20:33.098 --> 20:37.970
He's made it further than
any of our Indian competitors to date.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.538
Thirty seconds he's got.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.374
Kick off!

20:46.311 --> 20:47.579
[Chris] Go for it!

20:47.646 --> 20:49.448
You don't have the time!

20:49.514 --> 20:51.183
He's gonna jump!

20:51.850 --> 20:53.352
[Tiki] He hangs on!

20:53.418 --> 20:55.254
[audience cheering]

20:55.320 --> 20:58.991
[Tiki] Mujahid Habib is in the lead!

20:59.057 --> 21:02.628
-He's got about ten seconds.
-[Chris] Ten seconds to pull himself up.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.731
[Tiki] He's looking at it. You can tell
he wants that Point Thruster.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.402
What a move! What a smart move!

21:10.469 --> 21:12.771
-[Chris] He got the points.
-[Tiki] He got the Thruster.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.941
He was already in the lead
with 100 points.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.177
He finishes with 110 points.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.314
-Wow.
-Our best Indian competitor to date.

21:22.381 --> 21:26.184
Phenomenal!
He's made our country very proud. Mujahid!

21:26.251 --> 21:29.755
This is what real men are made of.
This is what real athletes are made of.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.556
-Well done!
-Thank you.

21:33.625 --> 21:37.496
[Chris] And after that amazing run,
up next we've got Yiqi Li from China,

21:37.562 --> 21:42.968
who used to be a nuclear physics major,
but left school to pursue parkour.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.039
[Yiqi] I really like parkour.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.840
The only stress I have

21:48.907 --> 21:52.544
is from my family and girlfriend.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.112
They wish that I had a stable job

21:54.179 --> 21:57.716
in an office, so that I could
have a stable income every month.

22:00.619 --> 22:05.691
I feel like when I'm doing parkour,

22:05.757 --> 22:06.858
I am very free.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.494
I can do whatever I want.

22:09.861 --> 22:12.064
I feel like if I win this,

22:12.130 --> 22:14.066
I would be recognized for my abilities.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.803
I believe the Ultimate Beastmaster
will be me.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.973
[Tiki] He's easily through the Grinder.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.810
25 points as he sets up for Faceplant.

22:24.876 --> 22:28.947
[Chris] Yiqi's girlfriend is unsupportive
of his parkour career,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.283
and she wants him to find a stable job.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.819
[Tiki] It may be short lived,
but you only live once.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.522
[Chris] Exactly.
So Yiqi's girlfriend, step off!

22:38.156 --> 22:39.424
Come on, Yiqi!

22:44.930 --> 22:48.433
-Yiqi Li, the invincible!
-It's so dangerous.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.470
He almost banged his head.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.338
[Qinyi] Yiqi Li, you can do it!

22:53.405 --> 22:57.409
Yiqi Li, you can do it!

22:59.411 --> 23:00.245
[Tiki] Yiqi!

23:01.780 --> 23:03.915
[Chris] His parents wanted him
to have a steady job,

23:03.982 --> 23:05.650
but he fell in love with parkour,

23:05.717 --> 23:08.186
did not become a scientist
and followed his heart.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.388
You should too, kids.

23:09.454 --> 23:13.592
[Tiki] He's eyeing that Point Thruster,
but is he gonna go for it?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.761
[Chris] Yiqi Li is only five foot six.

23:15.827 --> 23:19.564
[Tiki] So he doesn't even try,
and it's probably a smart move.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.567
Here's one thing -
it's important to know your strengths.

23:22.634 --> 23:25.103
It's also important
to know your weaknesses.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.838
Don't play outside yourself.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.207
-I'm going down to cheer for him.
-You can do it.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.676
[Tiki] Yiqi going for the Sling Shot.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.781
He's got a close grip.
It seems like he's got momentum here.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.048
Maybe he can swing.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.684
-Jump!
-You can do it!

23:40.118 --> 23:43.522
[Tiki] Let's see if he can use it
as he flies. Yes! He makes it!

23:43.588 --> 23:46.224
Made it relatively easy as well.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.693
[cheering]

23:48.760 --> 23:54.065
[Tiki] I know he is not trying
to get this side Thruster.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.535
And again, this is a trade-off.

23:57.035 --> 24:00.939
Because if you get that Thruster,
it's ten points.

24:01.406 --> 24:02.340
Oh, wow!

24:02.407 --> 24:03.742
Wow!

24:04.276 --> 24:06.011
That was so close for Yiqi Li.

24:06.077 --> 24:08.680
-[Tiki] Oh! Wow!
-[Chris] Wow!

24:09.514 --> 24:11.049
That was unbelievable!

24:11.116 --> 24:15.320
[Tiki] That takes some serious awareness
and agility to hang on!

24:15.387 --> 24:16.988
[Chris] He held onto that thing.

24:17.055 --> 24:21.493
[Tiki] Now can he make this jump
to the last Crash Pad, and finish Level 1?

24:22.961 --> 24:24.830
[Qinyi] Wait for it,
take it slow and steady.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.364
Hang in there!

24:27.098 --> 24:30.135
[Tiki] He's got to tilt it down,
so he's got to jump up.

24:30.202 --> 24:34.406
Again, these Crash Pads sink about
four feet when there's weight on them.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.009
Yiqi's got to make a move
and there he goes! He hangs on!

24:38.076 --> 24:39.511
[Chris] And he hangs on!

24:39.578 --> 24:42.447
[Tiki] This kid is small but powerful.

24:50.322 --> 24:54.259
Yiqi is trying to get balanced. Being
backwards is not going to help him.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.963
He's got to flip around.
There he goes. He's got one small jump.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.131
And China...

25:00.699 --> 25:03.969
finishes Level 1
with a somersault of confidence!

25:04.035 --> 25:07.906
[Chris] He does a somersault and
he gets mobbed by his Chinese countrymen.

25:07.973 --> 25:12.077
-[Yiqi] Chinese Kung Fu!
-This is just the first level.

25:12.143 --> 25:16.481
-Yiqi Li gave us a good start.
-Yiqi Li, you're the best!

25:16.548 --> 25:20.552
Our Chinese team will definitely
complete the other three levels.

25:20.619 --> 25:23.021
It won't be a problem
for the Chinese team.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.257
[Qinyi] China's the best!
Yiqi Li is the best.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.325
[team cheering]

25:27.392 --> 25:31.129
[Tiki] Congratulations to Yiqi!

25:31.196 --> 25:33.865
105 points!

25:35.133 --> 25:37.969
With that run,
we have an interesting situation here.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.438
One I don't think we've ever had before.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.308
Ritesh from India and TJ from Spain

25:43.375 --> 25:46.311
are both tied with identical times,

25:46.378 --> 25:49.047
so they are both on the bubble
with one competitor to go.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.616
So either
they are both going to be moving on,

25:51.683 --> 25:53.385
or they will both be eliminated.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.253
[Chris] Wow, that is definitely a first.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.456
[Tiki] Up next, our youngest competitor,
Brian Ludovici,

25:58.523 --> 26:00.325
who is only 19 years old.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.797
When I was younger, my parents divorced,

26:05.864 --> 26:09.034
and shortly after,
my mother developed a brain tumor

26:09.100 --> 26:11.469
that turned out to be cancerous

26:11.536 --> 26:14.940
and she passed away
when I was 13 years old.

26:15.607 --> 26:18.443
I was forced to grow up
really quickly in life.

26:18.510 --> 26:22.847
I started working full-time as a plumber.
I had to pay all my own bills.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.184
I had to buy food. I had to make sure
there was a roof over my head.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.986
And it was hard.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.290
I'm paying my own way
through college right now.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.393
I'll have a physics degree after this,
and I'm excited about it.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.296
When it comes to the Beast,

26:38.363 --> 26:40.899
this is important to me
because it's my first chance

26:40.966 --> 26:43.134
to really show the world what I'm made of.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.070
I've got the motivation and the skill.

26:45.136 --> 26:49.941
I've got everything I need. I just need to
put it all together and crush that course.

26:51.876 --> 26:54.579
[Tiki] One of the great stories
of this entire competition.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.417
This is the kind of kid
that you just want success for.

26:59.484 --> 27:00.318
[Chris] Yes.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.055
[Tiki] You see him fitting in Faceplant.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.324
It's tough for him because he's long.

27:06.391 --> 27:07.325
[Chris] So long.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.962
-[Tiki] He grabs on and makes it easily...
-[Chris] No problem.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.764
[Tiki] ...to the Energy Coils.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.834
Every Point Thruster, he'll go for.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.336
-[Chris] He might as well.
-[Tiki] And he'll easily get it.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.672
He didn't even have to try
to touch that one.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.841
Most of our competitors have to reach.

27:22.907 --> 27:25.310
And obviously,
they have trouble jumping back.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.845
With his six foot two frame,

27:27.379 --> 27:30.448
long legs and great agility.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.784
[Chris] A lot riding on Brian's shoulders.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.486
If he scores more than 80 points,

27:34.552 --> 27:38.490
he's going to knock TJ and Ritesh
out of the competition.

27:38.556 --> 27:39.924
Come on, Brian.

27:41.459 --> 27:44.663
Remember, competitors
have only six minutes to get through this.

27:45.430 --> 27:48.867
[Tiki] I'm rooting so hard for this kid
that I'm nervous for him.

27:48.933 --> 27:52.971
[Chris] Yeah. I thought it was the coffee,
but I'm glad you said something.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.607
[Tiki] As he gets though
these Energy Coils,

27:56.174 --> 27:58.643
he's making these jumps look easy.

28:06.451 --> 28:07.585
And that is it!

28:07.652 --> 28:11.089
Brian knocks out TJ and Ritesh.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.525
He is moving on to Level 2.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.659
Good job, Brian!

28:14.726 --> 28:17.829
[Tiki] One minute and thirty seconds
left on the clock.

28:17.896 --> 28:21.199
Can he propel himself onto the Crash Pad?

28:21.266 --> 28:23.735
-[Chris] Come on, Brian!
-[Tiki] This is about momentum.

28:23.802 --> 28:27.272
It's all about technique
to get this Sling Shot moving forward.

28:27.338 --> 28:28.440
[Chris] Alright.

28:29.074 --> 28:32.177
[Tiki] Because he's hit
both of the Point Thrusters,

28:32.243 --> 28:35.580
he's currently sitting at 105 points...

28:35.647 --> 28:37.849
-Oh, he hangs on!
-[Chris] He's not out!

28:37.916 --> 28:41.019
He's not out! Come on, pull yourself up!

28:41.086 --> 28:42.754
Pull yourself up!

28:43.254 --> 28:44.456
Come on!

28:44.522 --> 28:46.891
[audience cheering]

28:48.426 --> 28:50.895
[Tiki] He saves it! He pulls it out!

28:52.030 --> 28:54.032
[Chris] Wow.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.037
[Tiki] He's looking at the Point Thruster.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.505
Is he gonna go for it?

29:05.543 --> 29:09.280
And he's going to go for the Point
Thruster with less than a minute left.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.051
If he gets that thing swinging
a few more inches...

29:13.118 --> 29:15.954
-[Chris] Just forget about it!
-[Tiki] He got it!

29:16.755 --> 29:19.991
That is patience. That's perseverance.

29:20.058 --> 29:24.295
That's intellect.
He is solidly in first place.

29:24.796 --> 29:27.132
He's got two more jumps.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.033
He's still in it.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.036
All four limbs have to get in.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.406
Can he recover? Can he save it?

29:35.473 --> 29:38.376
[Chris] Come on, Brian! Here we go.
Is he gonna get it done?

29:38.443 --> 29:42.947
[Chris and Tiki]
Five, four, three, two, one.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.216
[Chris] And he ran out of time.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.520
[Tiki] But what an unbelievable effort...

29:49.087 --> 29:51.289
by Brian Ludovici.

29:51.356 --> 29:55.527
He is the pace-setter after Level 1

29:55.593 --> 29:58.029
of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

29:58.863 --> 30:03.701
125 points. That was unbelievable!

30:03.768 --> 30:09.307
The first of all of these competitors
to get all three of the Point Thrusters.

30:09.707 --> 30:12.010
[Chris] Wow, that was exciting!

30:13.444 --> 30:14.913
[overlapping chatter]

30:15.980 --> 30:17.215
Whoo!

30:18.583 --> 30:19.818
Thank you, man!

30:25.456 --> 30:26.791
That is right!

30:27.926 --> 30:31.429
[Tiki] Brian set the pace with 125 points.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.564
He is in first place

30:32.630 --> 30:37.502
but followed very closely
by Mujahid Habib of India with 110 points,

30:37.569 --> 30:40.371
and Yiqi Li of China with 105.

30:40.805 --> 30:44.175
And that is the end of Level 1.

30:44.242 --> 30:47.679
Ultimate Beastmaster!

30:49.581 --> 30:52.417
[Tiki] Level 2 of the Beast.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.121
Eight competitors
have made it through Level 1,

30:57.188 --> 31:01.659
but only five of them
will make it through to Level 3.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.663
[Brian] I'm starting off at the top.

31:06.364 --> 31:10.335
To be honest, my confidence
is kind of through the roof right now.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.237
I think I'm gonna crush this course.

31:12.737 --> 31:13.872
Team USA all the way.

31:15.173 --> 31:19.010
I'm not worried at all
because I have confidence in myself.

31:19.477 --> 31:23.815
All of them are strong,
but I think I can be the dark horse

31:24.315 --> 31:25.183
and win in the end.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.685
Jianguo Fang, victory belongs to China,

31:27.752 --> 31:28.887
and you.

31:32.523 --> 31:37.095
[Tiki] Raúl Beltrán comes in
with 80 points on Level 1.

31:37.161 --> 31:40.698
Spain! Spain!

31:40.765 --> 31:42.533
-Perfect!
-That's it! Come on!

31:42.600 --> 31:44.435
Come on, Raúl! You can do it!

31:45.970 --> 31:48.106
[Tiki] Raúl has a military background.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.176
And was diagnosed with depression.

31:53.044 --> 31:56.447
So he turned to CrossFit to get over it.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.083
[Chris] Wow. Commendable.

31:59.150 --> 32:03.121
-Alright!
-[Tiki] Making easy work of Spinal Ascent.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.189
25 points for Raúl.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.459
Spinal Descent is now
the obstacle he's going through.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.162
Those cords look deceptively easy,

32:11.229 --> 32:13.998
but it's actually much more difficult
than it seems.

32:14.065 --> 32:17.235
Come on! We'll celebrate
with a seafood platter in Ferrol.

32:17.302 --> 32:18.903
-That's it. Come on!
-Bravo!

32:19.504 --> 32:22.473
[Tiki] The first of four Point Thrusters
is at the bottom here.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.110
You've got to be sure not to get your feet
into the blood. Make them slick.

32:27.178 --> 32:28.413
He nails it.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.287
The first of the Stomach Churns
Raúl is on.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.056
He makes the jump to the second.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.592
-[Chris] No problem.
-[Tiki] Spins. Easily jumps to the third.

32:41.659 --> 32:44.429
-[Chris] No problem there.
-[Tiki] He's looking at the Thruster.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.435
-He jumps down to the last...
-[Chris] Perfect landing!

32:50.501 --> 32:52.403
[Tiki] ...of the Churns,
right in the middle.

32:53.571 --> 32:56.140
-Oh, no!
-[Chris] Did he hang on?

32:56.207 --> 32:58.509
[Paula] Perfect. Hold on.
I'll think he'll climb up.

32:58.576 --> 32:59.944
-He'll do it.
-[Saúl] Come on!

33:00.011 --> 33:01.412
No!

33:01.879 --> 33:02.714
Shame!

33:02.780 --> 33:06.117
[Tiki] That Digestive Track,
you take it for granted.

33:06.184 --> 33:08.086
You think you can step in and walk,

33:08.152 --> 33:10.788
but it's actually very slick.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.024
It's going to be really hard.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.327
It will be hard to qualify.
My competitors are really good.

33:16.594 --> 33:19.063
It's a shame. It's a real shame.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.502
-[man] Oossaa!
-[team USA] Oossaa!

33:24.569 --> 33:27.472
[Tiki] Now here's a great
American wrestling coach,

33:27.538 --> 33:30.508
and wrestler himself, Alex Picazo.

33:30.575 --> 33:31.442
[Alex] I feel good.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.212
When I was wrestling, competing,
my body was beat up.

33:34.278 --> 33:35.913
That's just the way it works.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.817
I know a lot of people are going around
here saying they are injured and sore,

33:39.884 --> 33:42.687
and that just tells me
I'm in competition mode.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.022
[Tiki] On to the first Churn,

33:44.088 --> 33:46.591
but he'll try to hit
that first Point Thruster.

33:46.657 --> 33:49.761
-He hits it with ease.
-[Chris] Picazo, no problem there.

33:50.294 --> 33:51.796
This guy is an elite athlete.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.500
If you're one of the top wrestlers
in Ohio State, you're a bad boy.

33:55.566 --> 33:59.537
[Tiki] Yeah, the Big 10 has some of the
best wrestling programs in the country.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.874
So if you go there and dominate,
you are one of the best.

34:05.643 --> 34:06.477
Here we go.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.146
This is the hardest of the jumps

34:08.212 --> 34:11.114
because that Stomach Churn
is spinning the fastest.

34:11.181 --> 34:12.350
[Chris] Come on, Picazo.

34:13.751 --> 34:15.253
-Just do it!
-[Tiki] Here we go.

34:15.319 --> 34:18.255
His leg slipped,
but he manages to hang on.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.058
[Chris] But he made it. Is he hurt?
Is he OK?

34:20.123 --> 34:24.929
[Tiki] I think he's OK, but with that
jump, he is currently in first place,

34:24.996 --> 34:27.098
with 145 points.

34:27.165 --> 34:30.902
Getting into the Digestive Track,
which was difficult for some athletes.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.440
[Chris] You kind of have to
just go through it like a toddler.

34:35.505 --> 34:36.607
[Tiki] Yes, baby steps.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.507
[Chris] Baby steps.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.911
[Tiki] You have to get to the top
with some altitude...

34:39.976 --> 34:41.344
[Chris] Which he did!

34:41.411 --> 34:43.714
-[Tiki] You can't delay! Just jump!
-[Chris] He made it!

34:43.781 --> 34:46.751
And he makes it!
And he's on to the Dreadmill.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.188
And he's on to the second Dreadmill.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.192
[Tiki] This second Dreadmill
obviously has a greater tilt to it.

34:54.257 --> 34:57.662
You can't afford to stand there
for too long, because you're working.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.565
And he's beat, he's tired, he's exhausted.

35:03.901 --> 35:04.836
[Chris] And he made it!

35:04.902 --> 35:06.737
[Tiki] He's got to hang on.

35:06.804 --> 35:10.608
He's got to hang on. That's a slope.
That is not a flat surface.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.510
And he pulls himself up.

35:13.311 --> 35:14.779
[Chris] Now, on to Chain Reaction.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.815
[Tiki] This is the part of the course
that he may have trouble with,

35:17.882 --> 35:21.219
because he's got to swing like Tarzan,
200 pounds.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.188
There is an opportunity
for a Point Thruster here.

35:24.255 --> 35:25.089
He missed!

35:26.457 --> 35:28.159
He's having trouble here, though,

35:28.226 --> 35:34.132
as his arms are starting to fatigue
from carrying 200 pounds on them.

35:34.899 --> 35:37.101
Given that he is tired right now, Chris,

35:37.168 --> 35:41.672
I think his best bet is to get the points
and drop so his time,

35:41.739 --> 35:44.742
should it come down to the tie breaker,
is an advantage.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.844
[Chris] Oh, smart move there!

35:46.911 --> 35:48.646
Got ten points. Rack them up.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.082
[Tiki] Let's see what he tries to do.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.085
[Chris] Every time he gets to the
next chain, he does get five points.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.220
[Tiki] Yes, and he's got to get
a lot of momentum.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.326
He's got to be getting fatigued.
You can see he's sliding down.

36:02.393 --> 36:04.562
And he lets it go.

36:04.629 --> 36:09.967
With 195 total points, Alex has
a great shot to move on to Level 3.

36:10.368 --> 36:13.070
[Alex] My grip wasn't there.
It wasn't where I needed it.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.906
I couldn't swing as hard as I wanted.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.175
At least I fought
to get that Point Thruster.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.577
Now, it's time to cheer Brian on.

36:19.644 --> 36:22.580
[Tiki] Level 2 has been
an absolute Beast so far.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.516
Let's check out highlights
from three more competitors

36:25.583 --> 36:27.518
as they attempted to advance.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.422
French parkour practitioner,
Valentin Dubois,

36:31.489 --> 36:34.859
was looking to climb the leaderboard
in Level 2.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.894
[Chris]
Valentin flying through the course.

36:36.961 --> 36:38.629
Looks like he has a turnip on his head.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.533
Come on Valentin. Come on!

36:45.436 --> 36:49.340
-Oh no, poor guy! What a shame.
-He was so close!

36:49.407 --> 36:52.243
-What a shame. He was doing so well.
-A real shame.

36:52.310 --> 36:55.213
That's how it goes.
It was pretty slippery.

36:55.279 --> 36:58.082
[Tiki] Jianguo Fang is now on the course.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.985
Rock climber and physical therapist,
Jianguo Fang,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.287
was powering his way through Level 2.

37:03.354 --> 37:07.525
It depends on his performance
whether he can get first place.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.860
Jianguo Fang, you can do it.
You're the best!

37:11.128 --> 37:12.363
Go, Jianguo!

37:12.430 --> 37:15.166
[Tiki] Quickly moving through
the Stomach Churn.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.568
[Chris] Oh, oh, oh!

37:17.635 --> 37:19.337
Hold on! Hold on!

37:19.403 --> 37:21.072
-OK.
-[Tiki] We see another one.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.409
-[Chris] I think both hands are in.
-[Tiki] And he is out.

37:26.544 --> 37:30.514
I should have been more careful.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.485
[Tiki] The Alpinist,
Matteo Della Bordella,

37:34.552 --> 37:37.722
was leaping through Level 2
like an Italian Lord.

37:37.788 --> 37:40.391
[Chris] Matteo has been practicing
mountain climbing

37:40.458 --> 37:41.292
since he was 12.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.493
That's what kids do.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.962
[Tiki] Then it was time
for that one final jump.

37:45.029 --> 37:48.633
He falls again. It's hard to make it.
He's got to hurry, he's got to jump.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.368
-[Chris] Just jump!
-[Tiki] Big jump.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.602
[commentators groan]

37:52.470 --> 37:54.739
[Bianca] What a pity!

37:54.805 --> 37:55.840
Crikey!

37:55.906 --> 37:59.076
Ouch! I hurt my head!

37:59.143 --> 38:00.411
[Tiki] Here are our standings.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.513
Our American wrestler, Alex Picazo,

38:02.580 --> 38:06.050
is on top of the leaderboard
with 195 points,

38:06.117 --> 38:10.788
followed by French parkour star,
Valentin Dubois, with 145.

38:10.855 --> 38:13.124
Five athletes
will advance to the next round.

38:13.190 --> 38:16.060
So that means our first competitor
on the bubble in Level 2,

38:16.127 --> 38:19.630
is navy search and rescuer,
Raúl Beltrán, from Spain.

38:23.401 --> 38:27.004
Next up, Mujahid Habib,
an architect from India,

38:27.405 --> 38:29.273
who is also a parkour champion.

38:29.340 --> 38:33.944
He started doing parkour all by himself,
learning from seeing videos online

38:34.011 --> 38:37.982
and from studying martial artists
Tony Zhou and Jackie Chan.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.918
I'm India's first national champion
in parkour.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.354
I have a need to fight fear.

38:43.421 --> 38:45.723
I enjoy conquering my fears.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.058
Nobody can stop me.

38:49.694 --> 38:53.531
[Tiki] With Mujahid Habib
currently sitting at 135 points,

38:53.597 --> 38:58.235
if he gets to the Stomach Churn,
Raúl Beltrán and the rest of Team Spain

38:58.302 --> 39:00.471
will be eliminated from the competition.

39:00.538 --> 39:01.939
He is six feet tall.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.141
He heads the parkour community in India.

39:04.208 --> 39:07.611
And he teaches parkour
to children in Rampur.

39:09.113 --> 39:14.151
[Tiki] Raúl Beltrán of Spain
has just been knocked out.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.588
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

39:19.390 --> 39:20.991
We've got some trouble here.

39:21.826 --> 39:26.263
[Chris] Like most climbers we've seen,
using a strategy to get himself back up.

39:26.797 --> 39:29.633
But now, remember,
his feet and sneakers are wet,

39:29.700 --> 39:32.770
so if he gets into the Digestive Track,

39:32.837 --> 39:35.873
it's going to be really hard
to get through it with wet feet.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.175
[Tiki] Time is the tie-breaker.

39:38.242 --> 39:40.344
The competition is about focus.

39:40.911 --> 39:45.282
Being calm and being Zen is good, but
a little too Zen will get you digested.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.119
-Yes, Mujahid.
-Good jump. Good leap.

39:49.253 --> 39:52.390
-It's the biggest challenge now.
-Come on! Come on, Mujahid.

39:54.859 --> 39:56.327
-Yeah!
-Oh, good.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.762
I love you, buddy.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.698
-Yeah!
-That's my tiger! Well done, Mujahid.

40:00.765 --> 40:04.168
[Tiki] Now you wonder, Chris, if those
wet shoes are going to have an effect.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.143
Uh-oh. He's sliding a little bit.

40:12.209 --> 40:15.746
He's six feet tall, so this Digestive
Track is a tight squeeze for him.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.815
He's got to hurry up and get to the top,

40:17.882 --> 40:20.484
before it pulls down
into the blood of the Beast.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.653
Go, buddy. Go on, take the jump.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.123
-Mujahid, my tiger! I love you, buddy.
-Please jump! Please jump!

40:26.323 --> 40:29.193
[Tiki] He's got to make a jump.
No! He can't hold on.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.662
[Chris] And he cannot hold on.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.365
[Tiki] Two competitors left on Level 2.

40:34.832 --> 40:36.901
[Chris] So now, Matteo from Italy
is on the bubble.

40:36.967 --> 40:40.237
Yiqi Li from China taking the course next.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.541
[Tiki]
Earlier tonight, Yiqi Li went ballistic

40:43.607 --> 40:46.310
and was the only competitor
to complete Level 1.

40:46.377 --> 40:49.480
Let's see if he can do it again
here on Level 2.

40:49.980 --> 40:53.350
[Chris] He currently has 130 points,
descending the spine of the Beast.

40:53.417 --> 40:56.220
[Tiki] Now if Yiqi Li
gets the Point Thruster right here,

40:56.287 --> 40:59.790
Matteo Della Bordella
will be knocked out of the competition.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.760
A great point opportunity,

41:02.827 --> 41:06.697
as the first of four Point Thrusters
is down at the bottom.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.567
[Chris] Yeah, it's all about
being able to swing over.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.936
-[Tiki] Kick it as he does.
-[Chris] There it is.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.638
[Tiki] Matteo Della Bordella

41:15.372 --> 41:18.409
is officially out of the competition.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.877
Matteo has been eliminated.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.880
-Sad for our Italian friends.
-They won't look at us.

41:22.947 --> 41:25.616
We can't get a break!

41:25.683 --> 41:28.185
We just can't get a break!

41:29.787 --> 41:33.757
[Tiki] Yiqi Li sticks to landing
like a gymnast from the Olympics!

41:33.824 --> 41:37.895
He is so graceful.
He makes it look easy.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.505
[Chris] Oh say can you see
Yiqi Li?

41:47.571 --> 41:50.741
[Tiki] A lot of our taller competitors
struggle in that Digestive Track

41:50.808 --> 41:52.176
because of their size.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.078
Yiqi Li is only five-six.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.081
He should have a huge advantage here
in this tight space.

41:59.717 --> 42:01.151
He gets through with some...

42:02.486 --> 42:05.489
effectiveness,
and he has to make a long jump.

42:05.556 --> 42:06.590
[Chris] Wow!

42:06.657 --> 42:07.725
[Tiki] He made it!

42:07.791 --> 42:09.326
[Chris] That was a great jump.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.394
[Tiki] That was impressive,

42:10.461 --> 42:13.230
because he was a little short,
but he picked his knees up

42:13.297 --> 42:15.332
and was able to land it on his feet.

42:15.399 --> 42:18.936
-[Chris] Get your knees to your chest.
-[Tiki] He made it look easier than it is.

42:20.304 --> 42:22.907
-He's flying through this course!
-[Chris] Yes, he is.

42:22.973 --> 42:25.943
[Tiki] Yiqi Li has got 180 points

42:26.477 --> 42:28.045
to start Chain Reaction.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.380
[Chris] Good for you!

42:29.446 --> 42:31.248
[Tiki] Doing his country proud,

42:31.315 --> 42:33.284
as his countrymen cheer him on.

42:35.619 --> 42:40.658
Alex, of the United States, has 195.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.560
If he gets this Point Thruster,

42:44.028 --> 42:46.897
he will be, and he now is, in first place!

42:47.398 --> 42:48.766
Bruce Lee!

42:52.303 --> 42:56.073
[Tiki] We haven't seen many competitors
be able to get into the Vertabrace.

42:56.941 --> 42:58.876
Yiqi Li, swinging around,

43:00.144 --> 43:02.580
trying to make his way to the Vertabrace.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.182
He's got momentum,
it looks like he'll make it!

43:05.249 --> 43:08.218
Nicely done.

43:08.285 --> 43:11.255
[Chris] I mean, think about
pulling that 200 pound vertebrae.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.658
You've got to have a lot of strength
to get that Vertabrace.

43:14.725 --> 43:18.696
[Tiki] We have not seen a lot of our
competitors this far into the course.

43:18.762 --> 43:22.166
That's seven feet
between each one of those Vertabrace

43:22.232 --> 43:24.034
and he jumps, and holds on.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.738
[Chris] It's got to hurt every time you
get to the next brace, banging your chest.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.873
[Tiki] Collect yourself. Gather yourself.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.476
And then prepare yourself
to experience pain.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.011
[Chris] Wow, he's crushing this.

43:34.078 --> 43:38.182
[Tiki] Yiqi Li has hit three
of the four Point Thrusters in this round.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.184
That's 30 additional points.

43:40.250 --> 43:44.054
Tonight, he isn't Yiqi Li. He's Bruce Lee.

43:45.089 --> 43:47.858
Bruce Lee, you can do it!

43:48.359 --> 43:50.928
-[Tiki] Can he get it done?
-[Chris] Come on, just do it, kid!

43:51.595 --> 43:53.297
[Tiki] That was impressive!

43:53.364 --> 43:56.066
He is now
comfortably in the lead on round 2.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.335
I mean, look at him go!
This is unbelievable.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.237
[Chris] One more Vertabrace
to get through,

44:00.304 --> 44:04.241
and then onto the mat to complete Level 2,
and get smoke in your face.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.378
[Tiki] Looks like he's gonna make it!

44:09.480 --> 44:11.081
And he made it!

44:11.148 --> 44:12.483
[cheering]

44:12.549 --> 44:15.753
Good! Very good!

44:15.819 --> 44:18.022
...with a somersault!

44:19.490 --> 44:21.759
Yiqi Li.

44:22.760 --> 44:26.630
He finishes Level 2 of the Beast

44:26.697 --> 44:29.366
with 250 points.

44:29.433 --> 44:32.670
-[Qinyi] Yiqi Li, you're so great!
-China's the best!

44:35.439 --> 44:36.774
[Tiki] Here are our standings.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.411
Yiqi Li setting the pace with 250 points.

44:40.477 --> 44:45.049
Alex Picazo from the United States
is second with 195 points.

44:45.115 --> 44:50.020
Mujahid Habib, who we just saw,
pulling in third with 170 points.

44:50.087 --> 44:53.223
Jianguo Fang is now on the bubble.

44:53.290 --> 44:55.359
It all comes down to this.

44:55.426 --> 44:57.161
One of our favorite competitors,

44:57.227 --> 45:01.832
Brian Ludovici, gets ready
to take on Level 2 of the Beast.

45:02.433 --> 45:06.770
He was near perfect on Level 1,
with 125 points.

45:06.837 --> 45:11.575
[Chris] Brian Ludovici sporting
the 2012 Justin Bieber bowl.

45:11.642 --> 45:14.144
I am a belieber in Brian Ludovici.

45:14.611 --> 45:18.682
[Tiki] A great story - he practically
raised himself from the age of 13

45:18.749 --> 45:22.920
after his parents divorced and his mother
tragically passed away from brain cancer.

45:22.986 --> 45:26.056
He became a plumber,
worked his way through school himself,

45:26.123 --> 45:30.227
because he wanted to be something bigger
than that, as he now takes on the Beast.

45:32.830 --> 45:35.699
[Chris] He's now knocked out
Jianguo Fang from China.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.334
[cheering]

45:37.801 --> 45:38.936
USA!

45:39.002 --> 45:41.205
Brian took a little misstep.

45:41.271 --> 45:45.175
USA! He had a little misstep though,
on that Spinal Descent. He hit hard.

45:45.242 --> 45:47.778
[Tiki] Brian is long.
I mean, really long. He is tall.

45:47.845 --> 45:50.614
Six foot two, our tallest competitor...

45:51.782 --> 45:54.084
in season two of Ultimate Beastmaster.

45:55.119 --> 45:57.354
But he's used that to his advantage,

45:57.421 --> 46:00.524
because he's able to get
these Point Thrusters pretty easily.

46:02.226 --> 46:04.695
Now he has this opportunity at the bottom

46:05.262 --> 46:06.497
of Spinal Descent...

46:07.431 --> 46:09.867
to swing back, get a Point Thruster.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.835
[Chris] But he did get his right shoe wet.

46:11.902 --> 46:12.970
Oh, my goodness!

46:13.537 --> 46:16.073
I thought he fell out.
That would be disastrous!

46:16.140 --> 46:17.508
[Tiki] He is through to Level 3.

46:17.574 --> 46:21.612
But you know, he does not want
his run to end prematurely,

46:21.678 --> 46:23.747
because the points are cumulative.

46:23.814 --> 46:26.583
Brian leaps
onto the second of the Stomach Churns.

46:30.387 --> 46:31.522
On to the third one!

46:31.588 --> 46:32.956
[Chris] I love this kid.

46:33.023 --> 46:36.360
[Tiki] Will he go for the Point Thruster?
He is long enough to do it.

46:36.426 --> 46:38.862
-As he steadies his feet...
-[Chris] Come on!

46:38.929 --> 46:40.731
-[Tiki] And he gets it!
-[Chris] He got it!

46:40.798 --> 46:44.668
[Tiki] And he jumps down to the last
of the Stomach Churns.

46:44.735 --> 46:47.704
[Chris] This is youth, baby.
He's got that wet shoe, remember.

46:47.771 --> 46:50.207
Let's see if it affects him
in the Digestive Track.

46:50.274 --> 46:53.844
It's going to take a lot of strength
and willpower to get up with a wet shoe.

46:55.512 --> 46:59.883
[Tiki] Brian is having some trouble
moving up the Digestive Track.

47:00.951 --> 47:05.322
You can see his height
is a disadvantage for him right now.

47:07.057 --> 47:09.226
Digestive Track sinks in.

47:09.293 --> 47:12.429
[Chris] Come on Brian, let's go, get out!

47:12.496 --> 47:14.731
[Tiki] He simply can't get it.

47:14.798 --> 47:16.667
He's gonna take the jump,

47:16.733 --> 47:18.335
but it's a long jump.

47:18.402 --> 47:20.804
[Tiki groans]

47:20.871 --> 47:23.073
[Tiki] And he knows he can't make it.

47:23.574 --> 47:25.409
He knows he can't make it.

47:25.475 --> 47:27.544
That's a disappointment for him.

47:27.611 --> 47:31.615
But Brian Ludovici
makes it through to Level 3.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.817
I'm definitely disappointed in myself.

47:34.484 --> 47:37.888
That tube is a lot more slippery
than I thought it was going to be.

47:38.322 --> 47:41.058
I couldn't get up it.
There wasn't anything I could do.

47:41.124 --> 47:44.194
But when it comes to fighting,
I'm never gonna give up.

47:44.261 --> 47:49.733
[Tiki] As we wrap up Level 2, Yiqi Li
leads the way for China with 250 points.

47:49.800 --> 47:54.371
Brian Ludovici and Alex Picazo
from the United States are tied

47:54.438 --> 47:56.173
at 195 points.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.243
Mujahid Habib from India at 170.

47:59.843 --> 48:04.848
And Valentin Dubois from France
rounds out the top five.

48:05.349 --> 48:06.850
[Alex] We got this!

48:09.786 --> 48:11.121
[Chris] Let's kick off Level 3.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.725
[Tiki] Now remember,
five competitors enter Level 3,

48:14.791 --> 48:18.295
but only two of them
will get a chance to go to Level 4

48:18.362 --> 48:21.531
to try to earn $10,000
and the title of Beastmaster.

48:21.598 --> 48:23.333
I really hope one of them is Brian.

48:24.501 --> 48:27.504
[Brian] The guy in the lead looks strong.
He's got a good upper body.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.539
He looks like a strong competitor.

48:29.606 --> 48:32.976
I know that stage three
is basically all upper body,

48:33.510 --> 48:35.178
so I'm gonna give it my best shot.

48:35.245 --> 48:38.582
[Yiqi] I'm in a bad position now

48:38.649 --> 48:42.185
because everyone
is aiming for first place.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.221
I will clear this level!

48:45.055 --> 48:46.857
[Tiki] It's time for our first athlete.

48:46.924 --> 48:51.395
Valentin Dubois from France,
coming in with 145 points.

48:51.461 --> 48:53.597
He needs at least 200 points,

48:53.664 --> 48:57.534
which means he basically
needs to complete the whole level.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.002
He's off to a perfect start.

48:59.069 --> 49:02.906
Easily gets the first hand hold, doesn't
even try to go for the Point Thruster.

49:02.973 --> 49:05.375
[Chris] The path to victory
just got a lot harder.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.979
[Tiki] Spinning around... That was odd.

49:09.379 --> 49:12.950
[Chris] I mean, he made it harder than it
had to be, but he's French and a show-off.

49:14.384 --> 49:16.520
No further, Valentin!

49:18.655 --> 49:21.858
[Tiki] Each one of the Coil Crawls
will give him five points,

49:21.925 --> 49:25.329
but these things
sink into the fuel of the Pyramid,

49:25.395 --> 49:27.197
so you have to be quick.

49:27.931 --> 49:32.369
A lot of the competitors end up
grabbing the next Coil Crawl

49:32.436 --> 49:33.470
from the bottom.

49:33.537 --> 49:35.372
It makes it harder to get to the next.

49:36.039 --> 49:40.110
But as you can see, this Coil Crawl is not
just a straight forward walk through.

49:40.177 --> 49:41.611
It's very awkward.

49:41.678 --> 49:44.982
Finding the perfect path
is actually very difficult.

49:45.048 --> 49:47.351
You must be quick
through this last Coil Crawl.

49:47.417 --> 49:49.886
They start sinking
as soon as they touch it.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.588
If you don't get through quickly,

49:51.655 --> 49:55.492
you don't have a chance
to hop up and grab the Hangman.

49:55.792 --> 49:58.662
-Come on, come on...
-Come on, go France!

49:58.729 --> 50:01.498
-Oh! No!
-No, no, no, no!

50:02.065 --> 50:05.335
[Tiki] Valentin Dubois
finishing Level 3 with 170 points,

50:05.402 --> 50:06.937
obviously not enough.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.772
He is knocked out of the competition

50:08.839 --> 50:11.274
and will not go forward to Level 4.

50:11.341 --> 50:12.642
Bye bye! Bye bye.

50:12.709 --> 50:16.013
He fell off the rigatoni-shaped coil

50:16.079 --> 50:20.083
and he's going home
on the first Air France flight to Paris.

50:22.252 --> 50:23.787
Victory to India!

50:23.854 --> 50:26.790
From India, it's Mujahid Habib.

50:26.857 --> 50:32.029
[Tiki] Mujahid Habib from India
starts Level 3 with 170 points.

50:32.095 --> 50:33.597
Almost falls!

50:34.464 --> 50:36.066
[Chris] Timed it perfectly, though.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.437
[Tiki] Just missed it! He was so close!

50:40.504 --> 50:44.107
He needed that. Now he's got
a lot of ground to make up.

50:47.611 --> 50:50.814
Now Mujahid is long,
he's tall, he's lanky.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.083
He can fit
through this Coil Crawl easily.

50:55.952 --> 51:00.457
And Mujahid, if you perform well today,
Sarah and I promise to take you to dinner.

51:00.524 --> 51:04.294
-Sarah's standing in warrior pose.
-She's standing like a warrior.

51:06.329 --> 51:08.432
[Tiki] Going for the Point Thruster.

51:09.533 --> 51:10.600
He gets it!

51:10.667 --> 51:11.902
[Sarah-Jane cheers]

51:11.968 --> 51:16.206
[Tiki] Not a lot of our competitors have
attempted to get that Point Thruster

51:16.273 --> 51:19.776
because it's right on the outside
of the Coil Crawl.

51:19.843 --> 51:23.680
Those Point Thrusters are so clutch
when you're down by a lot of points,

51:23.747 --> 51:27.150
so that was a big time move
by Mujahid to get that.

51:27.217 --> 51:28.985
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

51:29.052 --> 51:30.520
-Hold it!
-Keep going!

51:32.089 --> 51:35.192
[Tiki] Mujahid's run
is going to come to an end.

51:35.692 --> 51:40.197
30 points, giving him
a grand total of 200 points.

51:40.263 --> 51:45.402
He is mathematically in it,
but only by five points.

51:45.869 --> 51:46.870
Everyone is nice here.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.371
It was a tough competition.

51:48.438 --> 51:51.942
I tried, but I wasn't able to reach
because I was exhausted.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.544
So, let's see what happens now.

51:54.978 --> 51:57.180
[Tiki] Up next,
the first of our two Americans,

51:57.247 --> 52:01.952
Alex Picazo, currently in fourth place
with 195 points.

52:02.018 --> 52:07.057
Alex needs five points to tie our current
second place competitor, Mujahid Habib,

52:07.124 --> 52:09.159
who we just saw go through this run.

52:09.226 --> 52:13.029
He needs a huge run on Level 3
to get past Yiqi Li

52:13.096 --> 52:15.665
who is in the lead with 250 points.

52:15.732 --> 52:20.370
[Chris] We want an all-American final,
so let's go Alex! Oossaa! Oossaa!

52:20.437 --> 52:23.573
[Tiki] Two hands, he makes it!
Lands the first hand hold.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.243
Will he go for the Point Thruster?

52:26.309 --> 52:28.078
Just misses the Point Thruster.

52:30.447 --> 52:35.018
And with that, knocks Mujahid Habib
from India out of the competition.

52:37.120 --> 52:40.524
Can he get through fast enough
to get some more points on Hangman?

52:40.590 --> 52:43.059
He has to get through
this Coil Crawl effectively.

52:43.126 --> 52:45.862
[Chris] And as he's crawling through,
it's getting lower,

52:45.929 --> 52:50.000
so he's got to get through this quick
if he wants any chance to get to Hangman.

52:50.667 --> 52:52.536
Alright, get this Point Thruster.

52:52.602 --> 52:54.704
-[Chris] Missed!
-[Tiki] He missed the Thruster!

52:55.739 --> 52:57.807
That could come back to haunt him.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.012
The Hangman is where you make your money.

53:02.078 --> 53:04.114
75 points available.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.550
Can he make it?

53:09.186 --> 53:11.788
Alex Picazo now with 20 points.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.490
He's got to leap to make it.

53:13.557 --> 53:14.724
He can't make it!

53:14.791 --> 53:19.296
And with that faulty jump,
he falls short of his goal.

53:19.362 --> 53:24.734
He's only 20 points ahead of Brian
Ludovici, but well short of Yiqi Li's 250.

53:24.801 --> 53:26.203
He's still got a shot.

53:26.269 --> 53:30.407
But that means that only one American
is guaranteed a spot in Level 4.

53:30.974 --> 53:32.409
Right here, man.

53:32.475 --> 53:34.544
That was awesome. You did good!

53:34.611 --> 53:37.480
Pleasure competing with you.
It's been brilliant.

53:37.547 --> 53:39.749
[Chris] There's American comradery
right there.

53:41.017 --> 53:44.621
[Tiki] Alright, here he is!
The boy wonder!

53:44.688 --> 53:47.691
Brian Ludovici with 195 points.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.292
[Chris] Come on, Brian!

53:49.359 --> 53:51.661
[Tiki] He just needs to score
more than 20 points

53:51.728 --> 53:56.533
to knock out our other American, Alex
Picazo, and make it to the final level.

53:59.402 --> 54:01.771
[Chris] Brian makes it, no problem,
onto Prison Strike.

54:01.838 --> 54:03.840
[Tiki] Will he get the Point Thruster?

54:03.907 --> 54:05.175
[Chris] If he does, he's in...

54:05.242 --> 54:07.077
[Tiki] He missed it!

54:08.178 --> 54:09.746
He's got ten points.

54:11.214 --> 54:13.316
Make that 15!

54:13.383 --> 54:16.119
He just needs to make it
through the next Coil Crawl

54:16.186 --> 54:17.854
and he can tie this thing up.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.693
But of course, he's got to be thinking
about banking more points

54:23.760 --> 54:26.129
to cut into that huge lead by Yiqi Li.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.898
He's looking at the Point Thruster.

54:28.965 --> 54:30.767
Is he going to go for it?

54:30.834 --> 54:33.103
And he gets it! There you go!

54:33.169 --> 54:36.139
Alex Picazo has been eliminated.

54:36.206 --> 54:39.175
[Chris] Thank you, Alex. You're
a great man. You made America proud!

54:42.245 --> 54:46.149
[Tiki] You see, he's starting to rush.
He starts to panic a little bit.

54:46.216 --> 54:48.551
The same issue that Mujahid had.

54:48.618 --> 54:50.553
[Chris] But he's regaining his composure.

54:50.620 --> 54:53.123
[Tiki] He's got to make a leap
to get to the third one.

54:53.189 --> 54:54.824
He goes and he grabs it.

54:55.659 --> 54:59.029
Will he be able to pull enough energy,
and move through quickly

54:59.095 --> 55:00.964
to get a chance at Hangman?

55:01.364 --> 55:03.566
[Chris] Come on, Brian. Come on, buddy.

55:03.633 --> 55:05.902
[Tiki] He's got to crawl
like his life depends on it.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.170
[Chris] Let's go!

55:09.239 --> 55:10.473
Come on, Brian.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.742
[Tiki]
Again, his height might be an advantage

55:12.809 --> 55:15.011
if he's able to get some footing.

55:15.078 --> 55:17.547
-But he's got to hurry.
-[Chris] You think he can get to it?

55:17.614 --> 55:20.784
[Tiki] I think he can if he can
just get himself in a position to jump.

55:21.551 --> 55:24.154
-Oh, Brian!
-Just missed it!

55:24.487 --> 55:26.656
But it's enough to make it into Level 4,

55:26.723 --> 55:30.393
where he'll face off against our current
leader, Yiqi Li of China,

55:30.460 --> 55:33.763
who now leads Brian by just 25 points.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.098
The question becomes,

55:35.165 --> 55:39.869
how much distance can he put
between himself and Brian Ludovici?

55:40.103 --> 55:42.238
He's named, "China's Nuclear Bomb."

55:43.340 --> 55:46.142
[Tiki]
Yiqi Li with a lot on the line here.

55:46.209 --> 55:48.144
[commentators groan]

55:48.211 --> 55:49.379
[Tiki] Oh, no!

55:50.246 --> 55:53.383
[overlapping groaning]

55:53.450 --> 55:57.120
-The bomb didn't go off.
-What happened?

55:57.187 --> 55:58.521
[Chris] What happened?

55:58.588 --> 56:00.223
[Chris] Yiqi Li

56:00.690 --> 56:02.759
with an epic fall into the oil.

56:02.826 --> 56:05.528
I did not expect that. He's our leader!

56:05.595 --> 56:08.498
And he just couldn't get his footing right
on the treadmill.

56:08.565 --> 56:11.434
You can't jump
at the end of a moving treadmill.

56:11.501 --> 56:13.903
You have to jump before the end.

56:18.908 --> 56:25.315
Maybe I was too focused on the Coil Crawl.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.716
I was too careless.

56:26.783 --> 56:30.920
I let myself down. I feel really bad.

56:31.654 --> 56:33.556
It's America versus China.

56:33.623 --> 56:36.326
Let's hope the Beast is made in America.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.564
[Tiki] The stage is set.
The stakes are high.

56:41.631 --> 56:44.401
These two athletes
both know what they need to do.

56:44.467 --> 56:46.770
[Brian] I'm 25 points behind Yiqi Li.

56:46.836 --> 56:48.638
I've got a strategy for the peg board

56:48.705 --> 56:52.275
that I think will help me make up
those 25 points and come out on top.

56:52.709 --> 56:56.913
[Yiqi] Today's strategy
is to be faster than Brian.

56:56.980 --> 57:01.985
The winner will be
the one who finishes it first.

57:02.719 --> 57:05.054
[cheering]

57:05.121 --> 57:07.957
[Tiki] Level 4 of the Beast.

57:12.061 --> 57:14.330
Yiqi Li comes in with 250 points,

57:14.397 --> 57:17.233
Brian Ludovici, 225 points.

57:17.300 --> 57:20.336
Only 25 points separates
these two competitors

57:20.403 --> 57:23.106
as they take on Level 4 of the Beast

57:23.173 --> 57:26.242
and the chance to win $10,000

57:26.309 --> 57:28.645
and the title of Beastmaster.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.253
It's parkour versus parkour.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.355
The only difference is Brian is taller,

57:39.422 --> 57:41.825
but he's also a lot younger
at 19 years old.

57:41.891 --> 57:43.526
[Chris] Come on, Brian!

57:43.593 --> 57:46.896
-Yiqi Li, you can do it!
-The crowd is roaring.

57:46.963 --> 57:49.098
This is a battle
between America and China.

57:49.499 --> 57:50.700
Yeah!

57:50.767 --> 57:51.668
[klaxon sounds]

57:54.103 --> 57:55.772
[Chris] Oh, come on, Brian! Don't slip!

57:57.240 --> 57:59.442
They both got... You've got it, Brian!

58:01.211 --> 58:04.647
[Tiki] Brian is long, which should be
a little bit of an advantage.

58:04.714 --> 58:05.648
Come on, Brian!

58:05.715 --> 58:08.284
Yiqi Li is a very strong competitor.

58:08.351 --> 58:10.386
[Chris] I'm literally nervous right now.

58:10.453 --> 58:12.021
[Tiki] I'm nervous for Brian as well.

58:12.088 --> 58:13.223
[Chris] My heart is racing.

58:13.289 --> 58:15.525
[Tiki] As they make their way
across Full Tilt.

58:15.592 --> 58:19.395
-[Chris] Come on, Brian!
-[Tiki] Yiqi Li putting in the first peg.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.632
-[Chris] Brian almost fell.
-[Tiki] He's struggling.

58:24.968 --> 58:27.904
[Chris] Brian is really struggling
here on Full Tilt.

58:27.971 --> 58:30.340
[Tiki] Yes, he's struggled on Full Tilt.

58:31.074 --> 58:33.309
He's got 25 points
and a lot of ground to make up.

58:33.376 --> 58:35.044
[Chris] He's trying to get the Thruster.

58:35.111 --> 58:36.446
[Tiki] He gets the Thruster.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.248
That's ten extra points,

58:38.314 --> 58:43.086
which puts him 15 points
now behind Yiqi Li.

58:43.152 --> 58:46.789
Yiqi Li is already taking on
the Motherboard.

58:47.857 --> 58:49.792
As you can see, Brian is winded.

58:49.859 --> 58:53.329
His forearms and his hands
are sore and tight

58:53.396 --> 58:57.100
as Yiqi Li is about half way through
the Motherboard.

58:57.166 --> 58:59.302
[Chris] Come on, Brian! You can do it!

58:59.369 --> 59:01.271
[Tiki] And here he goes,
up the Motherboard.

59:03.072 --> 59:06.576
He can do it quicker. He can do it quicker
than Yiqi, he's twice the size.

59:06.643 --> 59:09.879
Come on, Yiqi!

59:13.116 --> 59:15.818
[Tiki] Yiqi Li has a big lead.

59:18.288 --> 59:21.758
[Chris] Come on, Brian, you've got a big
obstacle ahead of you, but you can do it!

59:22.592 --> 59:24.394
[Tiki] He's keeping an eye on Yiqi Li

59:24.460 --> 59:27.230
as he gets ready to mount Sky Hook.

59:27.297 --> 59:30.400
I think Yiqi Li is a man of few words

59:30.934 --> 59:32.735
but he's filled with energy.

59:32.802 --> 59:34.270
I think he can win this!

59:35.371 --> 59:38.074
[Tiki] Yiqi Li flying through Sky Hook.

59:38.141 --> 59:42.045
Brian Ludovici is still stuck
on Motherboard, and he's slipping.

59:42.111 --> 59:43.546
[Chris] Brian, don't look at that!

59:43.613 --> 59:46.482
Don't let that distract you,
that he's good at Sky Hook.

59:46.549 --> 59:48.918
-Because he almost...
-[Tiki] He almost fell off!

59:48.985 --> 59:49.919
[Chris] Come on, fall!

59:49.986 --> 59:52.689
[Tiki] He's got a little bit of an effort,
and he makes it.

59:56.059 --> 59:59.295
He barely gets that peg in.
He's trying to hook the side.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:02.031
This is hell on your arms.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:06.035
He does have a peg.
He left one just below his right foot.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.104
He's only got 30 seconds.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.808
[Chris] As Yiqi Li is making his way
up the Ventilator,

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.777
it's slipping away for Brian.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.380
[Tiki] Brian makes it to the top
of the Motherboard.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:21.818
But the lead that Yiqi Li has
is likely insurmountable.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:25.355
-Yiqi Li, you can do it!
-[Tiki and Chris] Ten, nine, eight, seven.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:31.294
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.063
China are the champions!

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.699
[Tiki] Yiqi Li of China

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:40.703
did not make it
to the top of the Ventilator,

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.006
but given his commanding lead,

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:46.275
claims the title of Beastmaster.

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:49.045
He'll go on to face the other winners

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:53.549
for a chance to be crowned
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.821
[cheering]

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:02.825
You're the best!

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:07.463
It's not as easy as I thought.
I'm really tired.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:12.902
I've finally proved to my friends,

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.972
my family and others that I can do this.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.708
[Tiki] That was amazing!

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:21.210
Who else is gonna join him
on the final night

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:25.515
for a shot at $50,000
and the title of Ultimate Beastmaster?

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:30.319
You tell us. You have the whole season
just waiting for you. Go watch.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.156
[cheering]

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.426
The Ultimate Beastmaster!

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.435
[inaudible chanting]

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.309
[theme music playing]
