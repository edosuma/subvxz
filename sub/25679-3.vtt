"Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.071 --> 00:08.441
{\an8}What type of person
announces to the world

00:08.508 --> 00:12.512
{\an8}that someone else is carrying
somebody else's baby?

00:12.579 --> 00:13.913
{\an8}Moniece, Moniece, Moniece!

00:13.980 --> 00:15.815
{\an8}You are trying
to build a brand.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.584
{\an8}You don't need
a "wife"

00:17.650 --> 00:20.153
{\an8}out there,
starting stuff.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.153
{\an7}I know.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.788
{\an8}We'll deal with it
after the baby is born.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.823
{\an8}We'll never deal with it
'cause I don't care
about dealing with it.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.125
{\an8}We have to respect.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.560
{\an8}She wasn't raised
like that.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.560
{\an9}Stop!

00:27.627 --> 00:29.162
{\an8}You guys can see the baby
when she gets here,

00:29.229 --> 00:30.997
{\an8}but me, I'm done.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.997
{\an8}Done with what?

00:31.064 --> 00:32.732
{\an9}Everything.

00:32.799 --> 00:36.336
{\an8}I see that ring finger
shining brighter than
all the others.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.505
{\an7}Yes, we're engaged.
Marcus may not know it yet,

00:38.571 --> 00:39.873
{\an8}but we're getting married.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.942
{\an8}Stas, what's up?

00:43.009 --> 00:44.310
{\an8}You're her friend,
Marcus?

00:46.246 --> 00:49.983
{\an8}I'm going on tour.
I have a date here
in L.A.

00:46.246 --> 00:49.983
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.284
{\an8}And I need you to sing.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.685
{\an8}But I thought Lyrica was
gonna be opening for you.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.154
{\an8}Thought, thought,
thought, thought.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.289
{\an8}I know for a fact...

00:54.220 --> 00:56.289
{\an7}Yeah.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.125
{\an8}Lyrica was trying to
(bleep) my friend Safaree.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.527
{\an8}You're going around telling

01:00.593 --> 01:03.096

{\an8}Safaree's the homie,
so I thought

{\an8}I could trust him to be
a friend right back,

01:50.210 --> 01:52.579
but this Hollywood attitude
that he got going on

01:52.645 --> 01:53.880

You can't come
to L.A. no more.

come at me like that?

{\an5}No, my (bleep).
You shouldn't even
have been texting her.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.261

at the gender reveal party.

{\an8}I may be Ray's wife, but I'm not
gonna join the Norwood cult,

At least I have friends
like Paris here,

03:09.622 --> 03:12.091
and today I'm getting
a cast mold of my baby bump

03:12.158 --> 03:14.761
because I never want to
forget my first pregnancy.

03:14.827 --> 03:16.329

Come on, I missed the...

you missed it.

03:22.735 --> 03:23.937
{\an8}What happened?

03:24.003 --> 03:27.407
{\an8}So Ray drags me to
his mom and his sister

03:27.473 --> 03:30.476
and asks me if I'm gonna
give him a public apology.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.612
{\an1}He probably just trying
to please everybody,

03:32.679 --> 03:33.813
{\an1}like to make good,

03:33.880 --> 03:35.648
Well, He's trying to
please the wrong people.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.985
{\an5}In all reality,
I'm probably gonna end up
talking to Sonja again,

03:39.052 --> 03:41.821
but I'm never talking
to Brandy ever again.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.023
She acts all sweet
when she's in public,

03:44.090 --> 03:46.059
{\an1}but you should see, like,
the stuff that she texts me.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.560
{\an5}I can't see Cinderella...

03:46.125 --> 03:47.560

{\an1}I get it, but I just can't see
Cinderella even doing that.

You know.

{\an8}that made my wife question
if I was a good man or not,

04:06.813 --> 04:08.815
so I talked to my wife
and she told me

04:08.881 --> 04:10.950
to pull up to
the sculpting studio,

04:11.017 --> 04:13.252

I never actually thought

knowing that I'm here,
pregnant,

she ain't cool with the family,

06:17.176 --> 06:19.045
First I found out that Marcus
has a girlfriend,

06:19.112 --> 06:21.647
and then I gotta deal with
Lyrica being in hot water

06:21.714 --> 06:24.784
because I ran my mouth to
Marcus about her and Safaree.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.487
{\an8}Yes, I feel bad.
Lyrica did keep my secrets

06:27.553 --> 06:28.955
{\an8}when I was going through
my situation

06:29.021 --> 06:31.324
{\an8}between Booby and Marcus,
but I can't

06:31.390 --> 06:33.092
get caught up in that
right now.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.194

My triple Ds was all the way
live earlier in my career,

06:45.037 --> 06:48.941
but as I matured, they are
just weights holding me back

06:49.008 --> 06:50.843
so I hit up a doctor to see

06:50.910 --> 06:53.813
if I can get that
breast reduction ASAP.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.249
{\an5}One of the first things
you're gonna notice
is shoulder pain.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.683
The neck pain's
gonna be gone.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.319
{\an8}It's gonna really change
the quality of your life.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.487
{\an8}However,
I want to let you know,

07:01.554 --> 07:02.688
{\an8}when I was examining you,

07:02.755 --> 07:05.691
{\an8}I felt some lumps
in your breasts.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.593
(Brooke)
As far as my knowledge goes,

07:07.660 --> 07:10.096
lumps and breast cancer
go hand in hand.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.299
{\an4}Yeah.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.299
Brooke, are you
with me? Yeah?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.268
So, while we're doing
the breast reduction,

07:15.334 --> 07:18.237
we'll take the lumps out
to get them analyzed,

07:18.304 --> 07:20.406
send them to pathology
and they'll tell us

07:20.473 --> 07:21.874
if there's anything
to worry about.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.812
Now, most likely, these
are benign tumors, okay?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.413
But in order to be
100% sure,

07:27.480 --> 07:30.049
we have to get
the biopsy results.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.318
Whew. Okay.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.487
This is a lot to take in
right now

07:34.554 --> 07:37.356
because no one in my family
has dealt with breast cancer,

07:37.423 --> 07:39.492

07:39.559 --> 07:41.127

{\an5}I'll see you next time,

Well, I just wanted

It's just like, me and A1
had a big old fight.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.510
{\an8}It was about a rumor
about me and Safaree

08:32.578 --> 08:34.380
having something
going on. Yes.

Hold up, hold up,

All this mess stemmed
from K. Michelle.

08:38.384 --> 08:42.288
{\an5}She, like, blurted out,
"And that's why you were
trying to eff Safaree."

08:42.355 --> 08:45.224
{\an1}Like, it was unbelievable,
and I was so caught off-guard

08:45.291 --> 08:46.926
because I thought
she was my friend.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.228
{\an1}No, I knew she wasn't
your friend,

08:49.295 --> 08:51.264

she's a dirty bitch.

She's definitely that.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.271
"I just had a
conversation with Marcus,"

08:58.337 --> 09:00.039
and Marcus said
that Brooke said

09:00.106 --> 09:01.674
that we were flirting
at Facebook Live.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.976
Okay, what I need
to understand is,

09:04.043 --> 09:06.412
{\an1}how did three or four
people get the same impression

09:06.479 --> 09:08.881
if there is nothing
inappropriate or...?

09:08.948 --> 09:11.384
First of all, everybody
knows Safaree is a flirt.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.319
He'll be like,
"Miss you, Lyr."

09:13.386 --> 09:16.122
{\an1}If you allowed that
to go down,

09:16.188 --> 09:17.790

looked inappropriate

to somebody looking on.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.193
But my thing is,
like, why is she...?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.329
{\an1}And didn't you tell me once
he sent you a picture

09:23.396 --> 09:25.965
that was inappropriate?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.965
{\an3}Mom.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.300
{\an1}I do remember you
saying that.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.102
No, I never said
"inappropriate."

09:30.169 --> 09:31.304
Like, you're being
just as messy

09:31.370 --> 09:33.306
as K. Michelle for
saying that. Like...

09:33.372 --> 09:35.107
{\an1}Why would you
even tell me that?

09:35.174 --> 09:36.676
Because I was telling you
that he reached out to me,

09:36.742 --> 09:38.611
but I never used the word
"inappropriate,"

09:38.678 --> 09:41.180

(bleep) it right there.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.395
But listen,
it was more Lyrica.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.096
Lyrica was more
the one doing it,

15:31.163 --> 15:33.399
and then it was like
he was carrying the bags.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.035
{\an1}I was carrying the bags.
Money bags.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.271
Whoa! Oh, let me go get
the RayCon mic.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.540
{\an5}(A1)
I can give credit
where credit's due,

15:41.607 --> 15:43.075
but for real,
I think Roccstar

15:43.142 --> 15:44.777
has always been
a little threatened by me.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.613
Lyrica and I had been dating
ever since she'd known Roccstar,

15:47.680 --> 15:50.549
and he claim I used to be
sitting outside of the studio,

15:50.616 --> 15:53.319
but in reality,
Roccstar is just a hater,

15:53.385 --> 15:55.587
and he's just mad
that I'm on the charts.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.656
All right,
so tell me, tell me.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.392

I had 60 placements.

spicy? That's my guy.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.369
{\an1}That's my brother, man.
There's always competition.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.738
Listen, I gotta go.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.206
{\an1}I got an important
phone call.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.443

Roccstar's career.

This is Bridget.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.287

If you in L.A. and looking
for a good time,

16:32.624 --> 16:35.794
Apple Watts is the best
entertainment you can get.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.063
I met her a while ago
at the strip club.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.232
Apple Watts is e'rything.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.034
Was she the one that
performed at your birthday?

16:42.101 --> 16:44.903
{\an5}That was her ass.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.903
(laughs)

16:44.970 --> 16:47.573
{\an5}But listen, I just came
here 'cause, you know,
I got invited here,

16:47.639 --> 16:50.442
so I'm trying to get my
music (bleep) together.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.611
{\an5}You know, I'm working
with A1 now.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.611
Ah! Okay.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.246
So I'm trying to get
out of the stripper game.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.581
{\an5}I'm tired of putting
a bottle between
my butt cheeks.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.015
{\an5}She's very talented.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.015
Yeah, she's talented.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.452
The way I am, it's
gonna be a real function.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.255
{\an3}Oh!

17:03.322 --> 17:04.423
I met Roccstar
a few years ago

17:04.490 --> 17:05.691
through some producer
friends of mine,

17:05.758 --> 17:07.760
and he has literally
written and produced

17:07.826 --> 17:09.762
for some of the biggest
names in the game.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.530

17:09.828 --> 17:11.530

17:11.597 --> 17:13.699
I met her in the club,
but she doing a switchover.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.200
She's in the studio now,
working on her music.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.803
{\an5}She working with A1.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.803
{\an1}Oh, A1?

17:17.869 --> 17:19.704
{\an6}Yeah.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.704

{\an5}I'll be right back.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.811

17:25.344 --> 17:26.811
What's up?

17:26.878 --> 17:28.647

Would Roccstar the hitmaker

17:28.714 --> 17:30.649
work with
Apple Watts the stripper?

17:30.716 --> 17:34.019
Probably not, but since
A1's in the picture,

17:34.086 --> 17:36.889
I might have to slide through
and see what she sounds like.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.190

with A1?

22:54.506 --> 22:55.640
You know,
my family's not here,

22:55.707 --> 22:56.908
my mama's not here.
I don't even...

22:56.975 --> 22:58.143
{\an1}And you feelin'
overwhelmed.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.313
I'm here. I got you.
You know what I mean?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.881
{\an5}How can I...

23:01.379 --> 23:02.881
{\an1}With situations
like this...

23:02.948 --> 23:05.817
believe that when you have
a girlfriend, like...

23:05.884 --> 23:09.721
{\an4}That has nothing
to do with me being
a great friend for you,

23:09.788 --> 23:11.590
as it's always been.

23:11.656 --> 23:13.625
You always know
what to say.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.127
{\an3}I love you.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.461
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

23:16.528 --> 23:19.331
{\an8}Now that I heard you and I
know you're actually dope,

23:19.397 --> 23:24.169
{\an7}I just feel like we
should get to, like,
the only issue I'm having.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.439
{\an8}I need her to come out
here if you're not
gonna let me in there.

23:27.506 --> 23:30.108
{\an8}K. Michelle!

23:27.506 --> 23:30.108
{\an7}Why is she yelling
like that?

23:30.175 --> 23:32.577

Meeting Roccstar
at Ray J's event

23:55.500 --> 23:58.136
got my confidence
boosted all the way up.

23:58.203 --> 24:01.206
I looked him up online,
and yes, his credits is good.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.908
I got A1 to work with me

24:02.974 --> 24:05.944
{\an8}and now I got another producer,
Roccstar, knocking on my door.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.080
{\an8}I think the world is ready
for me or something.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.916
{\an4}So, what's up, girl?
I've been waiting
for you to get here.

24:10.982 --> 24:14.119
{\an1}I'm like, we had such good
energy last time we linked up.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.955
{\an5}(Roccstar)
Obviously, I work with some of
the biggest stars in Hollywood,

24:17.022 --> 24:19.324
{\an8}so if Apple Watts
really wants to hit,

24:19.391 --> 24:21.393
{\an8}I mean, she came
to the right place.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.930
{\an1}If your music is matching up,
I feel like it's a go.

24:24.996 --> 24:28.166
{\an4}Yeah, you know, I'm
still trying to get
the music (bleep) together.

24:28.233 --> 24:31.002
{\an1}I'm just excited.
Like, hit me with something.

The rough around the edges
thing, I mean, it could work,

24:46.117 --> 24:49.287
but I'm taking everything
under A1's pearls

24:49.354 --> 24:50.755
and I'm remixing it.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.190
Now that I heard you

24:52.257 --> 24:53.792
{\an1}and I know
you're actually dope,

24:53.859 --> 24:55.894
{\an1}I just feel like
we should get to, like,

24:55.961 --> 24:58.129
{\an5}the only issue
I'm having...

24:55.961 --> 24:58.129
{\an3}What?

24:58.196 --> 25:00.198
{\an1}...which is like
a thorn in my toe.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.466
{\an1}You ever had a thorn
in your toe?

25:01.533 --> 25:02.767
No. I don't be
walking on it.

25:02.834 --> 25:07.405
{\an1}Well, I got one
and his name is A1.

25:07.472 --> 25:10.475
Why he irritates
every nerve in my body

25:10.542 --> 25:13.545
is because when Lyrica
used to come see me,

25:13.612 --> 25:15.847
I used to send A1
into the hallway

25:15.914 --> 25:17.682
to let
the grown people work.

25:17.749 --> 25:19.684
You're not even allowed
in the session.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.653
{\an1}I just feel like,
over there, it's like,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.722
{\an1}it's beginning stages,
beginning phases.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.357
{\an1}Over here,
you got an A list.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.392
I mean, he's, like,
the only one

25:27.459 --> 25:28.760
that actually said
he's gonna help me out.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.061
'Cause you guys relate.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.663
{\an1}Y'all probably get your hair
done at the same spot.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.098
I don't know what we do,
but I don't even know

25:33.164 --> 25:35.200
{\an5}what y'all beef
is about or what.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.200
Yeah, it's too deep.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.202
He just didn't like that
he was getting the coffee

25:37.269 --> 25:38.803
and I was already
making the records

25:38.870 --> 25:40.705
{\an1}and Lyrica was coming
to work with me

25:40.772 --> 25:42.641
{\an1}and he hadn't got a placement
or wasn't nobody yet,

25:42.707 --> 25:44.676
so ever since then,
he had resentment.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.846
{\an5}Yo, I done know the
whole story within a
second of me being here.

25:47.913 --> 25:49.314
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
you know the whole thing.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.082
People like you,
you gotta watch.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.218
{\an5}If you talking about
somebody else behind
they back

25:53.285 --> 25:54.786
and you talking
to a stranger...

25:54.853 --> 25:56.187
Well, are you
signed to him?

25:56.254 --> 25:57.923
I don't understand how...

25:57.989 --> 26:01.026
{\an5}I'm signed to how
I feel like to me
it's rules to the game.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.061
{\an5}(Apple)
I don't know what
funky stuff is going on,

26:03.128 --> 26:05.196
but I know Roccstar
is not about to use me

26:05.263 --> 26:08.266
to get back at A1.
That's not my get-down.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.168
{\an1}If you go messing
with two syllables...

26:10.235 --> 26:12.203
Wait, but your name
is Roccstar.

26:12.270 --> 26:15.040
That's two too,
ain't it?

26:15.106 --> 26:16.574
You know, I'm just saying,
I'm just saying...

26:16.641 --> 26:18.510
I ain't that smart,
but I was just saying.

26:18.576 --> 26:20.779
{\an1}You know, you go,
you know, major league

26:20.845 --> 26:22.614
or whatever other
league there is.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.817
{\an5}That decision has got to
be made before we make...

26:22.681 --> 26:25.817
{\an3}Whoa!

26:25.884 --> 26:27.519
{\an1}...whatever hits
we gonna make.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.220
I'ma deal with A1
because I have a feeling,

26:29.287 --> 26:31.756
like, you kind of
got me here because

26:31.823 --> 26:33.325
you doing some little
messy type of stuff,

26:33.391 --> 26:35.126
{\an5}but I know A1 up with me.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.126
The-- the audacity...

26:35.193 --> 26:37.729
{\an5}He's dealing with me
because he's actually
seen something in me.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.030
{\an1}But y'all ain't even
worked yet.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.132
It don't even matter
what we do,

26:41.199 --> 26:43.501
but what I'm gonna do
is make it in life,

26:43.568 --> 26:45.971
{\an5}so what I want to
do is make it out
that door first.

26:46.037 --> 26:48.707
{\an1}That's right.
A1, huh?

opened up for K. Michelle.

30:29.027 --> 30:31.129
{\an5}She's got to come out!

30:29.027 --> 30:31.129
But she's not--

30:31.196 --> 30:33.097
{\an1}This is a show.
You've got to go.

30:33.164 --> 30:36.968
{\an5}Ray J, I'm coming in
with you. I'm going in.
We're together.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.337
{\an8}I never thought that
I would see Lyrica G

30:39.404 --> 30:42.173
grabbing on my coattail,
trying to get backstage.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.310
I'm just coming to congratulate
K. on a great show.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.644
This how L.A. doing it?

30:46.711 --> 30:48.313
What do you mean,
(bleep)?

30:48.379 --> 30:49.380
I don't want no
(bleep) business

30:49.447 --> 30:51.049
in no (bleep) L.A.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.585
{\an5}These (bleep) bitches
kicking and screaming
and (bleep)!

30:53.651 --> 30:55.320
What you do to 'em?

30:55.386 --> 30:57.488
(Paris)
Like I feel bad.

30:57.555 --> 30:59.724
I've never had to kick out
an older person, man.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.025
This is crazy.

31:01.092 --> 31:02.794
{\an5}You know, Lyrica
is on that whole
L.A. (bleep).

31:02.860 --> 31:05.096
I'm not with (bleep),
so you saying

31:05.163 --> 31:06.998
some disrespectful
(bleep) to me,

31:07.065 --> 31:10.034
{\an5}I told your truth.
Be respectful.

31:07.065 --> 31:10.034
{\an1}Were you talking
about Safaree?

31:10.101 --> 31:12.036
Yeah. My friend
with the big (bleep).

31:12.103 --> 31:14.572
His (bleep) behind his
(bleep) ear like this.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.408
Hefty ass (bleep).
Like, how many (bleep)

31:17.475 --> 31:19.077
they gonna be
sending me, by Jesus?

31:19.143 --> 31:21.145
{\an1}She's saying, Moms Lyrica,
that I gotta...

31:21.212 --> 31:23.982
{\an4}I gotta go talk to them
and try to figure
this (bleep) out.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.551
All these rumors about
Lyrica and Safaree

31:26.618 --> 31:27.952
has taken over things.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.088
I was supposed to link up
with Safaree tonight,

31:30.154 --> 31:31.856
but dude is nowhere
to be found,

31:31.923 --> 31:33.524
and that's probably
for the good.

31:33.591 --> 31:35.460
Who knows what
Lyrica's mama would have did

31:35.526 --> 31:36.794
if she would have saw
that boy.

31:36.861 --> 31:38.229
I don't have to talk
to no Lyrica mom.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.964
Me and you,
we want honey.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.366
Ain't nobody's gonna
be doing that.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.334
{\an1}Let me make sure
it's clear.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.504
{\an5}(Moniece)
I'm bummed that
my girl Kimberly

31:46.571 --> 31:48.206
{\an8}wasn't able to make it
to the spectacle

31:48.273 --> 31:49.941
{\an8}that was A.D.'s fashion show.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.877
However, I'm glad that I was
able to make it here tonight

31:52.944 --> 31:54.679
to see her sing
her face off.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.180
(Moniece)
Hey, K., great show.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.349
Is this the person who was
throwing chairs at my wife?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.251
{\an5}At a pregnant woman?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.251
Yes, sir.
That's me.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.353
{\an5}Now you're throwing
chairs at pregnant women?

32:00.318 --> 32:02.353
{\an3}I am.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.689
{\an5}Damn, man.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.689
Well, I actually didn't
throw the chair.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.924
{\an5}That's crazy.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.924
I actually was able to
stop and think about it.

32:06.991 --> 32:09.594
{\an5}My feelings is hurt
about that.

32:06.991 --> 32:09.594
Your feelings aren't hurt.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.696
My feelings is hurt
is 'cause a human being

32:11.763 --> 32:13.197
would try to throw
a chair at my wife.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.533
Why is it that
your wife gets a pass

32:15.600 --> 32:17.635
to do crazy (bleep)?

32:17.702 --> 32:20.805
Here's what I want to know.
Why would you tell the world

32:20.872 --> 32:23.408
that my sister
was having our baby

32:23.474 --> 32:25.276
when you know
that was a lie?

32:25.343 --> 32:28.046
{\an5}I let her talk her (bleep)
and then she crossed
the line again...

32:28.112 --> 32:29.514
{\an5}Listen...

32:28.112 --> 32:29.514
...by talking (bleep).

32:29.580 --> 32:31.482
{\an5}I don't (bleep) care
about none of that.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.482
{\an3}Exactly!

32:31.549 --> 32:33.618
All I give a (bleep) about
is Princess right now.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.721
{\an5}(K. Michelle)
Oh, my God! My birthday twin
is (bleep) crazy.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.158
You have thrown a chair
at a pregnant woman.

32:40.224 --> 32:43.961
You have accused an R&amp;B legend
of blasphemy!

32:44.028 --> 32:46.731
I don't know what to think
about this bitch,

32:46.798 --> 32:49.334
but Lord,
I'm gonna be entertained.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.403
You should have kept
your wife away from me

32:52.470 --> 32:54.072
when she tried to
release the sex tapes.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.007
{\an5}So that justifies...

32:54.138 --> 32:56.007
{\an3}No!

32:56.074 --> 32:57.375
That right there
shows you...

32:57.442 --> 32:58.776
I didn't say there
was any justification.

32:58.843 --> 33:02.180
...what kind of heart
you have to human society.

33:02.246 --> 33:03.681
I have a very cold heart,
a very cold heart.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.684
A very bad... You're
a very bad person, man.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.520
You will not
disrespect my wife

33:09.587 --> 33:12.523
and you will not put
my baby in harm's way.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.625
{\an5}You tell your wife to
stay out of my (bleep)
way, you hear me?

33:14.692 --> 33:16.728
That's fine. I don't make
no threats, Moniece.

33:16.794 --> 33:18.196
{\an5}You know that.

Yes, you do.

All of the drama

but with our two moms going
at it, it's just too much.

33:44.389 --> 33:45.857
I'm not trying
to be the bad son

33:45.923 --> 33:47.692
that kicks his mama
out of the house,

33:47.759 --> 33:49.093

My big bro Loyd
lives in Kansas City.

He's two years older than me,
and we always been close,

34:02.507 --> 34:05.109

my own brother
ain't called me

34:06.477 --> 34:07.812
to let me know
that he's visiting.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.480
My mama must have
ratted me out

34:09.547 --> 34:11.149

34:11.215 --> 34:13.251
What's good?

{\an1}Yeah, I'm gonna
listen to my mother.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.636
You didn't have to
kick me out.

34:31.702 --> 34:34.005
Lyrica is the instigator
and she been a problem

34:34.071 --> 34:36.407
started since I been here.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.610
Her mama, that bitch

I could count on
my family for support.

35:56.854 --> 35:59.190
Our mama always taught us
to stick by each other,

36:42.567 --> 36:46.070
I realized that this whole thing
is getting out of control,

36:46.137 --> 36:48.940
so I took it upon myself
to go link up with Safaree

36:49.006 --> 36:52.743
to really get down to the bottom
of this crazy situation.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.445

we a brotherhood,

36:59.483 --> 37:00.785

that Safaree

37:00.851 --> 37:02.286
might be smashing Lyrica

37:02.353 --> 37:04.522
puts this whole thing
in a (bleep) up situation,

only one that can fix it.

{\an1}I don't know what
people think is going on.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.530
{\an5}You said that--
Look, you told A1,
"Bitches like me."

37:46.597 --> 37:49.200
{\an5}He came at me crazy.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.200
Just say it to me.
Whatever happened--

37:49.266 --> 37:51.736
{\an5}Whatever happened
with me and Lyrica
shouldn't have happened.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.805
{\an5}I didn't do nothing.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.805
What was it?

37:54.872 --> 37:57.408
What was it? Like,
it had to be something.

37:57.475 --> 38:02.013
{\an1}Brah, all I did...
It just was conversation

38:02.079 --> 38:07.151
and I accidentally sent her
a different type of picture.

38:07.218 --> 38:10.087
{\an5}You sent her the
picture that everybody
looking at right now?

38:10.154 --> 38:11.922
So you sent it
to her first.

38:11.989 --> 38:14.625
{\an1}It wasn't-- I didn't do it
on purpose, though.

38:14.692 --> 38:16.994
My brother...

38:17.061 --> 38:20.665
My brother,
it's already being said.

38:20.731 --> 38:23.134
It only happened once,
twice, (bleep) like that.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.504
I'm like, come on, man.

38:26.570 --> 38:29.640
{\an4}Nah! 'Cause ain't nothin'
happened with nobody
once or twice.

38:29.707 --> 38:33.744
{\an5}Yo, man, listen,
A1 and Lyrica got
back together,

38:33.811 --> 38:37.882
{\an5}and in order for them
to get back on lock,
she admitted it, fam.

38:37.948 --> 38:42.053
So she said me and her...

38:42.119 --> 38:44.522
You know you smashed.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.626
What did you do?

38:48.693 --> 38:50.528
{\an1}Like, I didn't mean
for it to happen.

38:50.594 --> 38:53.464
{\an4}It's just, we be talking,
"Hey, what's up? I want
you to get on this song."

38:53.531 --> 38:56.767
{\an5}And then...

38:53.531 --> 38:56.767
Why did you do that?

38:56.834 --> 38:59.537
{\an1}Listen, I thought that
you would deny it, deny it,

38:59.603 --> 39:01.372
{\an5}and I could clear
your name, but now
that you admitted it,

39:01.439 --> 39:04.608
I don't think
I wanted to know.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.610
Lyrica really didn't
admit it.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.612
I just needed to know
for myself.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.182
{\an5}(Ray J)
A1 is like a brother to me,
and I've never been

39:11.248 --> 39:13.017
the kind of person to lie
to my homie,

39:13.084 --> 39:14.819
so I don't know what to do.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.688
{\an1}I ain't trying to break up
no happy home,

39:17.755 --> 39:21.859
{\an5}and at the end of the day,
A1 is my boy too still,
you know what I'm saying?

39:21.926 --> 39:27.398
{\an6}Is he?

39:21.926 --> 39:27.398
{\an1}Look, whatever happened
with me and Lyrica, it...

39:27.465 --> 39:29.433
It shouldn't
have happened.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.644
{\an8}(Paris)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

39:40.711 --> 39:43.714
{\an8}I haven't seen you in so long.
What the hell is going on?

39:43.781 --> 39:45.583
{\an8}He's helping me
with my music.

39:45.649 --> 39:46.984
{\an8}We just shot a video.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.619
{\an8}(Paris)
So what you doing here?

39:48.686 --> 39:49.720
{\an8}I am grown, Akbar.

39:49.787 --> 39:50.988
{\an7}Yo, I don't want you
to relapse.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.357
{\an7}Let's go.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.357
{\an8}I'm not.
Quit saying that!

39:53.424 --> 39:56.927
{\an8}Don't be afraid of him.

39:53.424 --> 39:56.927
{\an7}I'm not afraid of him.
Uh-uh.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.296
{\an7}It gonna be smooth.
You gonna get in there,

39:59.363 --> 40:01.398
{\an7}you gonna come out,
you gonna get back to to life.

40:01.465 --> 40:03.000
{\an8}Brooke,
we're ready for you.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.103
{\an7}I wanted to talk to you
about something.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.538
{\an8}What you want
to talk to me about?

40:07.605 --> 40:10.608
{\an8}How would you feel
if I was pregnant?

40:12.543 --> 40:14.378
{\an7}You still think
you got a girlfriend?

40:14.445 --> 40:18.849
{\an7}She spread 'em wide,
you a little horny, cool.
Are we done?

40:18.916 --> 40:21.652
{\an7}Can you dismiss her
already?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.254
{\an7}Man, what you got
going on?

40:23.320 --> 40:25.189
{\an8}Lyrica keep
blowing me up, dawg.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.858
{\an8}"You having funny
at your porno party?"

40:27.925 --> 40:29.126
{\an8}What the (bleep) is
going on with that?

40:29.193 --> 40:30.728
{\an8}(Lyrica)
This what we doing?

40:30.795 --> 40:33.330
{\an8}I didn't know we was doing
disrespectful (bleep).

40:35.132 --> 40:37.535
{\an7}What's going on,
man? How you been?

40:35.132 --> 40:37.535
{\an5}You already know.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.770
{\an7}I know it's been kind of
frustrating for both parties.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.306
{\an8}Hey, ex-bestie.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.575
{\an7}I'm at Drew's house,
picking up the baby's sneakers,

40:44.642 --> 40:46.744
{\an7}and this person
walks down the stairs.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.946
{\an8}Who? Tell us!

40:49.013 --> 40:50.915
{\an7}Tiffany.

40:50.981 --> 40:53.751
{\an8}If she's gonna be a part of
whatever you guys are doing,

40:53.818 --> 40:55.019
{\an8}then count me the (bleep) out.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.821
{\an8}Bye. Thanks for coming.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.689
{\an7}How many of your sex tapes
has your son seen?

40:58.756 --> 41:00.491
{\an8}Bring up my son
one more time!

40:58.756 --> 41:00.491
{\an7}(bleep)!

41:00.558 --> 41:02.827
{\an8}How many times...

41:00.558 --> 41:02.827
{\an8}Bring him up! (bleep)!

41:02.893 --> 41:04.461
{\an8}♪♪
