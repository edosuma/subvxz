WEBVTT

00:10.711 --> 00:13.381
ALEX WAS MY PATIENT.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.849
HE UNDERSTOOD AS A--
AS A--

00:15.949 --> 00:19.287
AS A PILOT THAT

00:19.387 --> 00:21.922
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WERE,

00:22.022 --> 00:24.325
IN HIS MIND, INEVITABLE.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.862
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT HE WASN'T
ABLE TO FORGIVE HIMSELF, NO.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.465
THE THERAPY
WAS ENDED BY ALEX.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.335
( sighs )
WELL, HE FELT THAT
HE WAS READY

00:34.435 --> 00:36.704
TO GO BACK TO ACTIVE--
ACTIVE DUTY

00:36.804 --> 00:38.706
AND THAT--

00:38.806 --> 00:41.875
I BECAME AWARE

00:41.975 --> 00:45.779
THAT HE WAS INVOLVED
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.317
( chuckles )
ARE YOU ASKING ME

00:49.417 --> 00:51.719
IF I KNEW ON
A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL?

00:51.819 --> 00:55.289
THAT'S AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.325
NO.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.661
( theme music playing )

01:17.077 --> 01:19.447
- ( groans )
- WAS IT DIFFICULT?

01:19.547 --> 01:23.451
THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIKE--
THEY'RE LIKE VULTURES.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.854
I CAN'T BELIEVE
ANYBODY ACTUALLY
DOES THAT FOR A LIVING.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.157
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT IT?

01:29.257 --> 01:32.760
UM, ABOUT THE DEPOSITION?
NO, NOT REALLY.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.697
- I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.
- IT'S NOT EVEN 4:00.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.201
( exhales )
COFFEE, I MEAN.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.407
SOUNDS LIKE WE BOTH
HAD GREAT DAYS.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.643
MARC WAS IN ONE OF THOSE
BLACK MOODS THIS MORNING

01:49.743 --> 01:52.780
WHERE HE WAS YELLING
AT INANIMATE OBJECTS.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.150
TOOTHBRUSH IS
IN THE WRONG PLACE,
THE COFFEE'S TOO HOT--

01:56.250 --> 01:59.920
AS IF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
WERE CONSPIRING AGAINST HIM.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.356
IS THERE A PSYCHOLOGICAL
WORD FOR THAT?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.092
I-- I THINK IT'S
CALLED DISPLACEMENT.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.860
- EXCUSE ME!
- GREAT.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.198
AND THEN I WENT OVER
TO THE OFFICE AND JUDY WAS
IN ONE OF HER RAMPAGES.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.700
I-I'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT JUDY, RIGHT?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.536
- YOU DID?
- SHE'S THE ONE WHO
ACTS LIKE MY BOSS

02:15.636 --> 02:18.306
EVEN THOUGH SHE ISN'T
REALLY MY BOSS.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.908
GOD, DOES ANYBODY WORK
IN THIS PLACE?

02:21.008 --> 02:23.844
SHE SEARCHES FOR THE LYNCHPIN
OF MY PROJECT AND THEN
SHE PULLS IT.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.380
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
SHE'S TRYING TO SABOTAGE ME?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.683
IS IT POSSIBLE
I COULD JUST SIT HERE
FOR A MINUTE AND RELAX?

02:31.985 --> 02:35.423
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THE DEPOSITION,

02:35.523 --> 02:38.492
SO I WAS JUST TRYING
TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY DAY.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.862
WERE YOU?
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST
LISTEN TO YOUR PROBLEMS

02:41.962 --> 02:45.299
AND THEN INTERPRET YOUR
HUSBAND'S BEHAVIOR AND THEN
YOUR BOSS'S BEHAVIOR?

02:45.399 --> 02:48.902
- I WASN'T TRYING
TO DO THAT.
- YEAH.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.838
I'M SORRY.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.646
GOD, WE GOT HERE FAST.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.514
GOT WHERE?

03:00.614 --> 03:03.384
BLEW RIGHT PAST BEING
INFATUATED WITH EACH OTHER

03:03.484 --> 03:06.520
AND WENT STRAIGHT
TO FEELING OBLIGATED.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.290
BOTH OF US.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.793
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE EASY TO--

03:13.894 --> 03:16.196
TO SEE YOU.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.632
AND I THOUGHT
IT WOULD FEEL...

03:18.732 --> 03:21.134
GOOD.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.405
LOOK, I'LL CHANGE
MY APPOINTMENT AT GINA'S

03:24.505 --> 03:29.109
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO RUN INTO ME.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.345
I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.922
( knocks )

03:42.022 --> 03:45.058
( sighs )
SORRY.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.261
SORRY I'M LATE.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.165
ROSIE KEPT ME
WAITING FOR HALF AN HOUR.
SHE WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

03:52.266 --> 03:55.603
TURNS OUT ALL SHE WANTED
WAS THE KEYS TO THE CAR.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.471
( laughs )
DID YOU GIVE HER THE KEYS?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.807
- YEAH.
- WAS SHE HAPPY?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.610
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.778
I-I-I--

04:04.878 --> 04:09.350
I GUESS I WANTED
TO FEEL CLOSE TO HER,
WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT SCHOOL

04:09.450 --> 04:11.819
AND WHETHER SHE HAS
A BOYFRIEND OR NOT,

04:11.919 --> 04:14.688
HOW SHE'S DOING WITH KATE.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.758
WHEN YOU WERE ALL
LIVING TOGETHER, DID SHE
TELL YOU THOSE THINGS?

04:17.858 --> 04:20.561
SHE WOULDN'T-- SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO TELL ME

04:20.661 --> 04:23.230
BECAUSE I WOULD
HAVE SEEN THEM.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.600
I COULD OVERHEAR THEM
OR KATE WOULD TELL ME.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.905
- SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE
CONVERSATIONS THEN EITHER?
- NO.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.242
- DO YOU TALK
ON THE PHONE?
- WE TRY.

04:35.343 --> 04:38.145
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I CAN ALWAYS TELL

04:38.245 --> 04:41.449
SHE'S I.M.ing HER FRIENDS
ON THE COMPUTER.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.617
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO
TO FEEL CLOSE TO HER?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.320
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

04:46.420 --> 04:50.190
DO YOU REMEMBER
A TIME WHEN YOU WERE
LIVING AT HOME

04:50.290 --> 04:52.726
AND YOU FELT
CLOSE TO HER?

04:54.261 --> 04:56.397
YEAH.

04:56.497 --> 05:00.501
THERE WAS ONE TIME
I-I-I TOOK HER--

05:00.601 --> 05:04.037
SHE BROKE HER ARM
AND KATE WAS OUT OF TOWN

05:04.137 --> 05:06.874
SO I GOT TO TAKE ROSIE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.544
A LOT OF SITTING--
EMERGENCY ROOM,
TREATMENT ROOM--

05:10.644 --> 05:13.414
AND WE WERE WAITING
FOR THE CAST ON HER ARM TO DRY.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.283
AND IT WAS JUST--
JUST ME AND ROSIE.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.219
ALL AFTERNOON,
JUST ME AND HER.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.022
I READ TO HER.
I TOLD HER STORIES.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.325
PLAYED 20 QUESTIONS
AND I SPY.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.897
YEAH, THAT WAS
A HAPPY DAY.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.536
YEAH, PRETTY SAD, HUH?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.839
I MISSED SO MUCH.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.382
WHAT IS IT?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.150
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST-- I--

05:50.250 --> 05:53.454
I TOOK--

05:53.554 --> 05:56.223
I TOOK APRIL
TO THE HOSPITAL
THIS WEEK.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.992
THAT'S YOUR PATIENT
WHO HAS CANCER.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.661
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.864
WELL, SHE WASN'T--
SHE STILL WASN'T
TELLING ANYBODY--

06:03.964 --> 06:06.133
HER FRIENDS OR HER FAMILY.
SHE WASN'T--

06:06.233 --> 06:08.301
SHE WASN'T
GETTING TREATMENT.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.571
SO AFTER OUR SESSION,
I JUST GOT UP,

06:10.671 --> 06:13.541
I TOOK MY COAT AND I JUST
BROUGHT HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.809
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.
BUT YOU SEE, THE ONCOLOGIST

06:15.909 --> 06:17.811
HAD ALREADY MADE
A TREATMENT SCHEDULE

06:17.911 --> 06:19.813
SO ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS GET THERE.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.381
SO I TOOK HER THERE.

06:21.482 --> 06:25.085
I WAITED WITH HER
TILL SHE WAS FINISHED
AND THEN

06:25.185 --> 06:27.521
I TOOK HER HOME.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.257
DID YOU TELL HER STORIES?

06:30.357 --> 06:34.595
NO, WE WERE JUST QUIET.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.567
WERE YOU REMINDED
OF THE DAY

06:39.667 --> 06:42.536
THAT YOU SPENT WITH ROSIE
IN THE HOSPITAL?

06:42.636 --> 06:46.607
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I'D GIVE THE LAST
10 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO--

06:46.707 --> 06:50.210
TO BE BACK IN THE HOSPITAL
WITH ROSIE THAT AFTERNOON

06:50.310 --> 06:52.813
WAITING FOR
HER CAST TO DRY.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.154
I HATE MY LIFE.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.425
IT'S BROKEN.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.831
EVERY DAY

07:10.931 --> 07:13.667
IT HURTS.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.437
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING
FROM MY FAMILY,

07:17.538 --> 07:20.641
SO I TRY TO GET IT
FROM MY PATIENTS.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.712
I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
BUT WHO ELSE DO I HAVE?

07:24.812 --> 07:28.115
WHO ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO GET
WHAT YOU NEED FROM?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.017
NOBODY.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.220
BUT, OKAY,
I HAVE YOU.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.055
BUT Y-YOU CAN'T

07:35.155 --> 07:37.791
GIVE ME WHAT I NEED.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.594
- IT'S NOT YOUR JOB.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOU NEED.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.497
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY WATER?
- WAT--

07:43.597 --> 07:46.066
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
WATER FOR YOUR PATIENTS.

07:46.166 --> 07:50.571
PAUL, YOU'RE SO CONVINCED
I WON'T HAVE ANY WATER
FOR YOU,

07:50.671 --> 07:53.607
YOU DON'T SEE IT.
IT'S SITTING RIGHT THERE.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.721
THANKS.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.760
SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU NEED?

08:12.860 --> 08:16.997
I DON'T--
I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING SPECIAL.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.298
JUST-- JUST WHAT--

08:18.398 --> 08:19.867
WHAT EVERYBODY NEEDS.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.402
WELL, YOU HAVE FOOD.
YOU HAVE CLOTHING.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.672
- YOU HAVE SHELTER.
- WELL, SORT OF.

08:24.772 --> 08:29.242
I HAVE A DEN
WITH NO OTHER BEARS.
IS THAT SHELTER?

08:31.979 --> 08:34.815
- YOU NEED
SOME OTHER BEARS?
- MM-HMM.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.917
YEAH.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.954
I MISS THEM.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.457
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.526
I KNOW YOU DO.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.565
I DO.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.269
I MISS DINNER, YOU KNOW?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.772
I MISS THE AFTER-DINNER.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.909
WHAT DO YOU DO IN BROOKLYN
BETWEEN DINNER AND BEDTIME?

09:02.009 --> 09:04.544
OH...

09:04.645 --> 09:09.449
SOMETIMES I GO
TO THE LOCAL BAR.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.786
THEY'VE GOT THE SOCCER
FROM ENGLAND ON.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.224
THAT'S GOOD, SO...

09:17.324 --> 09:19.526
THEN I HAVE-- HAVE A DRINK.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.063
WELL, DO YOU EVER MEET
ANY WOMEN AT THE BAR?

09:23.163 --> 09:27.601
I SEE THEM.
I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY SEE ME.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.070
I'M LIKE THAT--
( laughs )

09:30.170 --> 09:33.073
THAT LONELY GUY
IN THE EDWARD HOPPER PAINTING,

09:33.173 --> 09:35.676
- SITTING AT THE BAR.
- ( chuckles )

09:36.409 --> 09:38.078
TELL ME ABOUT THE WOMEN.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.248
- SOME OF THEM
ARE PRETTY, YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.151
THEY WEAR BRACELETS
THAT JINGLE.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.354
THEY GO OUTSIDE TO SMOKE.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.860
LIKE MY--
LIKE MY PATIENT MIA.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.228
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE MENTIONED MIA.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.530
SHE WAS A PATIENT
20 YEARS AGO.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.067
SHE CAME BACK
THIS YEAR. SHE'S--

10:00.167 --> 10:02.269
WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.

10:02.369 --> 10:06.573
SHE'S A LAWYER THAT WORKS
FOR THE FIRM THAT'S HANDLING
THE DEPOSITION-- THE LAWSUIT.

10:06.674 --> 10:10.944
WE HAD A CONVERSATION
ABOUT THE CASE THEN SHE
CAME BACK AS A PATIENT.

10:11.044 --> 10:15.148
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN COMPLICATED?
- COMPLICATED EMOTIONALLY.

10:16.383 --> 10:20.020
BUT SHE'S REALLY SMART.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.890
AND SHE'S--

10:22.990 --> 10:25.659
- SHE'S FUNNY.
- CHALLENGING?

10:25.759 --> 10:28.628
I THINK YOU COULD THROW
THAT ONE IN THERE, YEAH.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.065
SHE'S ALSO THE KIND
OF WOMAN THAT,

10:32.165 --> 10:35.102
IF SHE MANAGED TO WORK
THROUGH HER ISSUES,

10:35.202 --> 10:38.739
SHE COULD CONCEIVABLY

10:38.839 --> 10:42.009
BE RIGHT FOR ME.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.116
I-I-- I'M NOT
IN LOVE WITH HER.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.754
BUT...

10:53.854 --> 10:58.491
COULD SEE MYSELF
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE HER.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.560
YOU'VE CHEERED UP
JUST TALKING ABOUT HER.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.030
WELL, I AM DRAWN
TO HER, YEAH.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.833
BUT AFTER LAST YEAR
AND LAURA, I--

11:05.933 --> 11:07.701
I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO FALL IN LOVE

11:07.801 --> 11:09.469
WITH ANOTHER PATIENT
FOR A WHILE.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.204
OH, IS THAT A RELIEF.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.440
( both laughing )

11:15.675 --> 11:18.378
BUT IS SHE IN LOVE WITH YOU?
IS THAT WHY YOU MENTIONED HER?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.914
NO, I MENTIONED HER BECAUSE

11:21.014 --> 11:23.416
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THINGS THAT I NEED.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.719
MM-HMM.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.156
I NEED A WOMAN.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.625
- FOR SEX?
- IS THAT WHAT WOMEN
THINK THAT MEN--

11:32.726 --> 11:35.328
REALLY THINK THAT THEY
WANT THEM JUST FOR SEX?

11:35.428 --> 11:37.965
NO, I WAS JUST ASKING YOU
IF YOU WANTED SEX.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.667
- OF COURSE I WANT SEX.
I'M NOT DEAD.
- OKAY, WELL...

11:40.768 --> 11:42.770
THEN GOOD.
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.039
THAT'S OUR SUBJECT--
WHAT YOU NEED.
SO YOU NEED SEX.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.975
I NEED FUN.
I NEED RELEASE.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.744
I NEED CONTACT
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.649
- HOW ARE THINGS
GOING WITH TAMMY?
- ( groans ) OH, NOT TAMMY.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.952
- HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING HER?
- YOU KNOW I HAVE.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.789
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.795
WELL, SHE AND I HAD COFFEE.
THEN WE HAD DRINKS.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.463
THEN... WE...

12:10.563 --> 12:12.065
HAD A NIGHT
AT MY APARTMENT.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.567
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
TRAVELING AWAY ON BUSINESS--

12:14.667 --> 12:17.905
A FURTIVE AFTERNOON--
THEN IT WAS OVER.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.573
- YOU HAD SEX?
- YES, MOTHER.
LIKE BAD CHILDREN.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.276
WE HAD SEX.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.746
- GEE, I--
- YOU KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.748
YOU MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.551
I SOUND LIKE A REALLY
TOUGH AND JEALOUS MOTHER.

12:31.651 --> 12:35.088
I WON'T LET YOU HAVE SEX.
I MAKE YOU ASK ME
FOR WATER.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.391
YOU DARED ME TO SEE HER.
YOU WANTED TO SEE

12:38.491 --> 12:40.360
IF I COULD

12:40.460 --> 12:42.896
CONTROL MYSELF.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.197
NO.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.868
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO RESIST AN OLD LOVER.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.304
YEAH.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.374
TOO BAD I DIDN'T HAVE
MORE OF THEM.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.952
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK
TO TAMMY

13:05.052 --> 13:07.254
IN A LITTLE WHILE,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.621
UM...

13:08.721 --> 13:10.390
I'D LIKE TO TALK
SOME MORE ABOUT THE BEARS.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.192
- OKAY.
- HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR FATHER?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.794
I-I-I--
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE IS.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.965
- JESUS, I--
- DID YOU GO TO SEE HIM?

13:18.065 --> 13:21.201
NO, I DIDN'T GO TO SEE HIM.
I MEANT TO, AND--

13:21.301 --> 13:23.403
- WHY NOT? IS HE BETTER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
HE MAY HAVE--
HE MAY HAVE TAKEN
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.309
HE FELL A FEW TIMES
IN THE HOSPITAL SO THEY MOVED
HIM INTO ANOTHER ROOM.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.779
HE MIGHT HAVE A FEVER.
I'M GETTING ALL THIS

13:32.880 --> 13:34.814
FROM-- FROM PATRICK.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.118
I WAS BUSY PREPARING THIS WEEK
FOR THE DEPOSITION.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.288
THAT WAS A TREAT,
LET ME TELL YOU.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.390
- SO YOU DIDN'T
GO SEE YOUR FATHER.
- NO, I DIDN'T.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.758
AND IF YOU DON'T STOP
NAGGING ME, I WON'T.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.261
I'M NOT
NAGGING YOU, PAUL.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.497
I'M REMINDING YOU

13:50.597 --> 13:53.100
THAT BEARS
DO NOT LIVE FOREVER.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.470
AND THIS BEAR, WITH WHOM
YOU HAVE VERY MANY
UNRESOLVED ISSUES,

13:57.570 --> 14:00.440
- HE'S DYING.
- MY BROTHER SAYS
HE'S DYING.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.043
THAT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN
THAT HE IS DYING.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.712
WOULD YOU RATHER JUST GET
A CALL THAT HE'S DEAD?

14:05.812 --> 14:07.747
LET THEM CALL
MY FUCKING BROTHER!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.616
PAUL.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.986
YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT THIS, BUT YOU DO.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.923
IF YOU DIDN'T CARE,
WHY WOULD YOU

14:16.023 --> 14:18.291
HAVE REACTED THIS WAY
WHEN I BROUGHT HIM UP?

14:21.995 --> 14:25.098
PAUL, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.068
- ( sighs )
- PAUL.

14:32.906 --> 14:36.143
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY
YOU'RE NOT GETTING WHAT
YOU NEED FROM ANYONE,

14:36.243 --> 14:39.346
BUT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.
IT'S AS THOUGH
YOU'RE A BABY.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.749
YOU WOKE UP FROM A NAP
AND YOU STARTED CRYING,

14:42.849 --> 14:45.385
BUT NOBODY IS COMING IN
TO SEE WHAT YOU NEED.

14:45.485 --> 14:49.222
AND SO YOU CRY LOUDER
AND YOU SHAKE THE BARS
OF THE CRIB.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.726
AND STILL NOBODY COMES.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
YOUR FATHER IS THERE.

14:53.826 --> 14:58.431
HE'S IN THE ROOM WITH YOU,
BUT YOUR ANGER AT HIM
IS SO PROFOUND

14:58.531 --> 15:01.534
- THAT YOU CAN'T SEE HIM.
- MY FATHER CAN'T HELP ME NOW.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.104
NO NO,
HE PROBABLY CAN'T.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.739
BUT UNTIL
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE

15:06.839 --> 15:09.476
HIS PRESENCE
IN YOUR LIFE,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.079
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.547
AND YOU'LL CONTINUE
TO SHAKE THE CRIB.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.950
CRIB? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M A GROWN MAN.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.685
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.021
BUT WHAT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN IS A GROWN SON
TO YOUR FATHER.

15:21.121 --> 15:25.558
AND UNTIL YOU DO THAT,
PART OF YOU IS ALWAYS
GOING TO STAY A BABY.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.462
OR AT BEST,
A TEENAGER WAITING
FOR YOUR MOTHER TO DIE.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.299
- MY MOTHER'S ALREADY DEAD.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.036
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF,
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.806
NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR DAD
COULD STOP IT.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.475
AND THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN DO NOW IS

15:42.575 --> 15:47.247
HOPE TO HEAL THIS WOUND
SO THEN YOU CAN MOVE ON.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.952
PAUL.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.423
WE BOTH KNOW

15:56.523 --> 15:59.692
WHAT IT'S LIKE NOT TO BE
THERE AT THE END.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.498
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T GET OVER.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.439
EVER.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.716
HI, DAD.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.153
I'M BACK.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.793
BACK AGAIN.
SORRY I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T--

17:10.663 --> 17:13.533
I DIDN'T GET HERE

17:13.633 --> 17:15.768
EARLIER.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.510
WHAT DID YOU USED
TO CALL ME?

17:23.610 --> 17:26.079
( tearfully )
ROTTEN LITTLE SHIT.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.590
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE?

17:37.690 --> 17:40.660
I CAN GET THEM TO UP
THE MORPHINE IF YOU WANT.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.234
YOU'VE BEEN LYING
SO STILL ALL DAY.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.149
ROSIE AND THE BOYS ARE...

18:03.483 --> 18:06.953
VERY UPSET ABOUT
THE D.N.R. YOU SIGNED.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.522
THEY WANT ME TO, UH...

18:11.023 --> 18:13.293
TO OVERRIDE IT.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.296
BUT I SAID,

18:16.396 --> 18:19.632
"HE'S A DOCTOR.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING."

18:21.334 --> 18:23.570
CAN YOU HEAR ME, DAD?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.010
OH.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.746
I'LL READ YOU THE...

18:33.846 --> 18:37.116
SPORTS PAGE.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.890
AH, I SEE

18:43.990 --> 18:47.126
UNITED ARE AT
THE TOP OF THEIR TABLE.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.562
AGAIN. HUH.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.366
BUT YOU'LL BE GLAD
TO KNOW THAT--

18:53.466 --> 18:56.436
THAT CITY ARE ONLY
TWO POINTS BEHIND.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.441
UNITED ARE ALWAYS
AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.054
I GUESS I FORGOT
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN
TO YOU IF--

19:15.154 --> 19:18.725
IF I CAME.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.263
NO, I--

19:23.363 --> 19:26.299
I KNEW WHAT
IT WOULD MEAN.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.436
I WAS JUST--

19:29.536 --> 19:32.605
I WAS JUST TOO MAD
AT YOU AND...

19:34.341 --> 19:36.543
IT WAS STUPID.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.555
I'M SORRY, DAD.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.293
I KNOW IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT,

19:53.393 --> 19:57.430
WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.770
YOU COULDN'T--

20:05.071 --> 20:07.039
YOU COULDN'T SAVE HER.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.576
NEITHER COULD I.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.381
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH
FOR BOTH OF US,

20:14.481 --> 20:17.884
SO I GUESS YOU FOUND
YOUR WAY OUT.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.488
IT'S LIKE

20:21.588 --> 20:23.723
WITH KATE AND ME,
YOU KNOW?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.700
ANYWAY...

20:37.437 --> 20:40.440
"MANCHESTER UNITED CONTINUE...

20:41.408 --> 20:44.311
THEIR WINNING FORM AS...

20:54.086 --> 20:56.956
THEY...

20:57.056 --> 20:59.659
OUST...

21:00.427 --> 21:02.595
LEAGUE CHAMPIONS..."

21:07.800 --> 21:09.702
DAD.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.979
( softly )
OH, DAD.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.689
DAD.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.906
( theme music playing )
