"I don't wanna die!"

Fine.
I'm going back to the television studio,

into the kitchen.

I've only done it, like, twice since then.

Why didn't you tell me
this evil woman is coming?

04:17.473 --> 04:20.186
She didn't tell me.
It's just a complete sneak attack,

04:25.948 --> 04:28.662

She hates me.

She does not <i>hate</i> you.

Oh, wait. Did you say "hate you"?
Oh, yeah, she hates you.

04:33.672 --> 04:36.302
She always introduces me
as "what's her name."

04:36.385 --> 04:40.560

for not going into the family business.

04:41.145 --> 04:44.193

-None of your business.

04:46.656 --> 04:50.205
Before this darkness
descends upon our house,

there are a few things
I have not yet told my mother.

Little things, like...
the fact that we got divorced

04:55.716 --> 04:58.221
and re-engaged the same day
with the help of a falcon.

04:58.304 --> 05:00.809
And that I live next door
in a haunted house.

05:01.728 --> 05:04.775
-Why haven't you told her the truth?
-I could never.

05:04.859 --> 05:07.447
The only thing
she hates more than Kimmy is divorce

05:07.614 --> 05:09.117
and Beyoncé's Lemonade album.

05:11.998 --> 05:14.044
She's gonna find out the truth now.

05:14.127 --> 05:18.803
Or... perhaps...
we could pretend that this is my house

05:18.887 --> 05:23.020
and that we all live here with D.J.,
our housekeeper, and her three sons.

05:25.442 --> 05:28.656
It's not that much of a stretch.
D.J. does fold a lot of laundry.

05:30.493 --> 05:32.372
I'm not comfortable lying to Grandma.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.669
If it wasn't
for Kimmy's selflessness, I...

26:26.752 --> 26:28.840
wouldn't have the opportunity
to be a mom.

26:29.549 --> 26:33.474
I've got to admit,
Kimmy is a pretty incredible woman.

26:33.808 --> 26:35.895
Wow. I am really confused.

26:37.732 --> 26:41.699
I second that. About Kimmy being great
and Danny being confused.

26:43.118 --> 26:44.705
And she's a great mom.

26:47.084 --> 26:48.337
I'll vouch for that, too,

26:48.420 --> 26:51.343
even though she did just try to evict me
from my own house.

26:54.015 --> 26:55.184
Kimmy...

26:56.269 --> 26:57.480
I am so sorry. I...

26:58.983 --> 27:00.444
I misjudged you.

27:01.530 --> 27:03.701
And I'm sorry we misled you.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.671
Fernandito, Kimmy is obviously
a very special woman.

27:09.755 --> 27:14.138
You have to win back her trust
so you can put your family together.

27:14.973 --> 27:16.059
I'm working on it.

27:16.769 --> 27:21.319
Kimmy, Mama, Ramona,
Jimmy, D.J., Stephanie...

27:23.240 --> 27:24.868
I am sorry again for my lies.

27:27.039 --> 27:30.588
Should we, um... how you say?
Group hug?

27:33.594 --> 27:35.598
[all cheer]

27:37.894 --> 27:41.025
You know, uh...
I actually created the group hug.

27:42.570 --> 27:43.572
That's nice.

27:44.866 --> 27:47.664
Still, I think maybe
we should name the baby Nadia.

27:48.039 --> 27:50.252
If it's a girl. And if it's a boy--Nadio.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.550
-Oh, I love it.
-Not a chance.

27:55.137 --> 27:57.266
How about another group hug?
Let's do this.
