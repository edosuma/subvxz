WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:03.937
( bell rings )

00:03.969 --> 00:06.506
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.539 --> 00:09.542
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.576 --> 00:12.479
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:16.116
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.149 --> 00:20.053
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.721 --> 00:24.724
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:27.694
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.727 --> 00:30.697
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.730 --> 00:34.300
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.334 --> 00:38.371
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.519 --> 00:55.588
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:55.622 --> 00:58.625
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:02.262
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:13.807 --> 01:16.109
Okay, what are we doing?

01:16.142 --> 01:19.646
- Just relax and follow me.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.315 --> 01:26.286
Why did you drag
me back to the club
in the middle of the night?

01:26.319 --> 01:30.623
The deal was,
you pay for the movie,
I pay for the snack.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.893
( scoffs ) I have been called
a cheap date before,
but this is ridiculous.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.562
( laughs )

01:35.595 --> 01:38.298
Being the boss's daughter
does have its advantages.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.567
I know where the chef
hides all the good stuff.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.602
I'm looking at the good stuff.

01:52.712 --> 01:56.616
- Stacey?
- Yes, Zack?

01:56.649 --> 02:00.387
- I want you to
know that I love...
- Yes?

02:00.420 --> 02:03.156
I love the way
you butter bread.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.794
This is margarine,
but thanks anyway.

02:07.827 --> 02:09.829
( laughs )

02:09.863 --> 02:13.767
If someone told me we'd end
up together I would have
laughed in their face.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.470
I know, I thought you were
an uptight,
spoiled Eastern snob,

02:17.504 --> 02:20.240
- and those were
your good qualities.
- Oh yeah?

02:20.273 --> 02:25.245
I thought you were just a
lazy, gnarly,
scheming California dude.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.846
( laughs )

02:26.880 --> 02:29.382
I'm glad I was wrong.
How about you?

02:29.416 --> 02:31.484
Oh, I was right...

02:32.419 --> 02:34.354
...dude,
but I like you anyway.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.424
Well, awesome. ( laughs )

02:37.457 --> 02:39.426
I like you too.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.494
A lot.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.573
Stacey, what's this big
important announcement your
father wants to make?

02:53.606 --> 02:57.510
- I promised not to tell.
- Maybe he's
giving us all raises.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.713
Kelly, are you taking
stupid vitamins again?

02:59.746 --> 03:01.915
We're lucky he pays us
in American money.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.421
Whoa!
Check it out!

03:08.455 --> 03:12.425
Mr. Carosi has
turned cool overnight.
Hey, dude, give me five.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.960
Quit begging
for tips, blondie.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.364
Listen up,
this is an ATV rider.
Like it?

03:17.397 --> 03:20.433
Wow, a KLF300-B3,

03:20.467 --> 03:24.304
all with a two-valve
four-stroke engine and an
automatic clutch. ( laughs )

03:24.337 --> 03:28.975
- What's that for?
- I'm not sure.
But it sounds sexist.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.344
The club has rented
several of these babies

03:31.378 --> 03:34.347
for the Annual
Charity ATV Race
next week.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.716
How can you race TVs?
They don't have wheels.

03:36.750 --> 03:41.554
No, simplehead, an ATV race.
They come with wheels.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.725
Every participant will have
to find a club member to
sponsor them in the race.

03:45.759 --> 03:50.096
Everyone back to work.
Time for me to peel out.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.366
( screaming )

03:54.634 --> 03:56.603
<i>- ( loud crash )</i>
- Dad!

03:59.472 --> 04:01.441
- Are you hurt?
- I'll be fine.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.944
Some terrorist must have
put this in reverse.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.615
Mr. Carosi, it looks like you
jammed the throttle,
bent the clutch...

04:08.648 --> 04:11.317
- That gives me an idea.
- What?

04:11.351 --> 04:13.787
You fix it.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.423
See you guys later.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.464
''See you later.''
( kissing sounds )

04:24.497 --> 04:27.434
Whoa, Preppie,
you've been working overtime.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.637
- Slater,
just chill out, all right?
- Okay, I'm sorry. ( laughs )

04:30.670 --> 04:33.707
Didn't realize
it was so serious
between you and Stacey.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.776
Yeah, I didn't think so either
until our last date.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.814
Now I've come down
with a major
case of the big L.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.783
Oh no, this is horrible.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.687
My best friend has the big L.
What's the big L?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.090
Love, stupid.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.892
I just wish I
could tell Stacey.
I don't know how to, though.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.762
- Say it fast and duck.
- Why duck?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.965
Because every
time I tell a girl
l love her, she clobbers me.

04:58.998 --> 05:03.770
Preppie,
girls like guys to tell them
how beautiful their eyes are,

05:03.803 --> 05:07.374
how soft their
hair is, you know,
romantic junk like that.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.043
- I know that.
- You can't tell
them at a video arcade

05:10.076 --> 05:14.047
while you're
scarfing down chili dogs.
Go someplace romantic.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.484
Then it's smooth
sailing after that.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.386
You know, that's a good idea.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.755
Tonight I'll take Stacey
to Paradise Cove.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.657
I'll tell her right there.

05:24.691 --> 05:28.395
Mr. and Mrs. Osgood, I
found Jill playing a little
too close to the water.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.697
So I thought
I'd bring her back
so you can keep an eye on her.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.599
Kelly, thank you.
You're the best.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.068
If there's anything we can do
to show our appreciation...

05:35.068 --> 05:37.103
You can sponsor me
in the ATV Charity Race.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.640
Absolutely. Nelson,
write Kelly
a check for the charity.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.915
This gives me an idea.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.093
- Come here, come here.
- Let go.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.530
Let go, let go, let go.

06:03.563 --> 06:07.701
I found your kid. You can
thank me by sponsoring me
in the ATV race.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.537
Go ahead and write out
a big fat check, I'll wait.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.072
He's not our kid, you goof.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.041
And even if he were,
we wouldn't sponsor you.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.144
Let go of me, dweeb,
I'm not lost.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.048
Come here!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.051
- Ah.
- Hi, Screech.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.587
What are you doing,
the Mexican dork dance?

06:27.620 --> 06:30.657
- No, that little
kid just kicked me.
- What kid?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.893
Ow!

06:33.927 --> 06:38.064
Oh, he's kind of cute.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.735
Lisa, how would your family
feel about sponsoring
me in the ATV race?

06:41.768 --> 06:44.904
Honey, my family wouldn't
sponsor you for
medical research.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.841
But you're right,
we should sponsor someone.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.509
Zack: Hi, guys.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.978
- Zack,
have you found a sponsor?
- No, not yet.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.180
Good,
because the Turtle family
wants the pleasure.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.450
- Thanks, Lisa.
- You're welcome. See you.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.122
Hi, Stacey. We have to talk,
it's really important.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.092
Oh, no, did my father
fire you again?

07:06.126 --> 07:10.697
No, no, this is serious.
Let's talk tonight at
Paradise Cove, okay?

07:10.730 --> 07:14.434
Paradise Cove? Sure.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.173
- Ooh.
- Got you, dork.

07:20.206 --> 07:24.811
From now on, leave my
brother alone or you'll have
to answer to me.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.659
I'm sorry, Mrs.
Johnson, we do not
give refunds for cloudy days.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.064
Hey, Jessie, I heard
you signed up for the race.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.965
That could be dangerous.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.701
Listen, Porky,

07:47.734 --> 07:51.771
women are just as qualified
as men to race those ATM...

07:51.805 --> 07:55.075
Those AT&T...

07:55.075 --> 07:58.712
- Those... Those things.
- They're called ATVs.

07:58.745 --> 08:02.615
And I'm not
talking about women,
I'm talking about you.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.552
It does not take
a male brain to drive one.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.054
Yeah? I watched you
take your driver's test

08:08.088 --> 08:12.125
and the instructor
sat in the back seat praying.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.029
You're so funny, pardon me
if I don't die laughing.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.565
Are you two guys
fighting again?

08:18.598 --> 08:21.034
Both:
It's what we do best.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.039
Guess who, Stace?

08:26.072 --> 08:28.575
- Craig!
- ( laughs ) Surprise.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.044
You didn't think
I was gonna let
an entire summer go by

08:31.044 --> 08:33.513
without seeing my girl?

08:43.789 --> 08:47.160
- Everyone,
this is Craig Strand.
- Hello, guys.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.628
Girls: Hi.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.364
Craig is Stacey's steady,
he's a sophomore at Yale.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.434
And girls, you have
my permission to drool.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.603
Boy, Zack's in real trouble.

08:56.636 --> 09:00.540
- That guy is
better looking, taller...
- Quiet.

09:00.573 --> 09:03.343
Craig is my choice
for the ATV race,
I'll be sponsoring him.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.147
Thank you, sir.
It will be an honor
to wear the Carosi colors.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.683
Craig, let's go to
my office and talk.
Tell me about school,

09:09.716 --> 09:13.420
the tennis team,
your rich father...
I mean your mother and father.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.488
Nice meeting all of you.
See you at the race.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.590
- Slater: <i>See you.</i>
- Girls: Bye.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.460
Son, I'm glad you're here.
I'm sure Stacey's missed you.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.430
I don't think she's had
any real friends out here.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.598
Then you'll be
happy to know, sir,
that I plan on asking her

09:25.632 --> 09:30.036
- to wear my fraternity pin.
- Wear your pin?
That's wonderful.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.273
Imagine,
my little girl, pinned.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.075
She's all I've
been thinking about.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.377
I only wish my
fraternity brothers
could be here

09:37.410 --> 09:40.080
- to give her
the rightful ceremony.
- Say no more, son,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.649
I'll arrange everything.
We'll make it a surprise.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.484
- Deal?
- Deal.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.319
Now that you're practically
in the family,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.521
does your father have
any good stock tips?

09:52.158 --> 09:54.227
Why do we have to
eat at the club?

09:54.260 --> 09:58.264
We're here, I'm hungry
and I know the owner.
( laughs )

09:58.298 --> 10:00.066
Let's go
somewhere else, Craig,
anywhere else.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.768
I know a great
little taco stand
in Mexico.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.803
- Yeah, right.
- Please.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.112
Yikes!

10:13.613 --> 10:17.384
Here, free rolls,
just wipe them off.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.456
Zack, ooh, you look tired.
Here, have a seat.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.558
No, go home,
I'll take your tables.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.360
I feel fine.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.829
No, Zack, I mean, please,
please give me your tables.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.233
I need the money.
My cat needs braces.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.671
Screech, get away.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.473
- Stop!
- What is it now?

10:40.507 --> 10:42.642
Zack, you're fired.
Get out!

10:42.676 --> 10:45.245
Take the back door.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.181
Have you been
eating chocolates again?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.884
Zack, don't go over there,
Stacey's there
with her boyfriend.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.253
Oops.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.622
What? What boyfriend?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.465
- Hi.
- Zack, hi.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.802
Yes,
hello, we'd like to order...
The avocado salad looks good,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.137
- we'll have that.
- Stacey...

11:11.171 --> 11:13.340
Aren't you gonna
introduce me?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.342
Introduce you?
To who?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.644
Come on, Stace.
Don't be shy with the waiter.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.748
Hi, I'm Craig Strand,
Stacey's
boyfriend from Boston.

11:21.781 --> 11:25.518
Boyfriend... That's it,
I'm out of here.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.321
Zack, wait.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.192
( doorbell rings )

11:36.262 --> 11:38.331
( doorbell rings again )

11:46.639 --> 11:48.675
Jessie, put the bat down.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.778
No, if that's a robber,
this bat's gonna
scare him away.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.314
You're not gonna
need the bat, honey,
just nag him to death

11:54.347 --> 11:56.750
like you do everyone else.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.386
- ( rings )
- How's my hair?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.721
Really pretty,
I just like it up.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.791
- Would someone
answer the door?
- All right. Who's there?

12:04.824 --> 12:06.860
It's me, Zack.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.197
Hi.
What are you guys doing up?

12:11.231 --> 12:14.701
Answering the door.
What else do
people do at midnight?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.637
I was just in
the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by.

12:17.671 --> 12:20.740
Does this visit have
anything to do with Stacey?

12:20.774 --> 12:23.543
Stacey? Stacey who?

12:25.679 --> 12:28.948
Yep, this is gonna be
a long night.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.618
Somebody better
put the coffee on.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.987
Does anyone
know how to do that?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.389
Forget the coffee,
I'm in pain.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.927
I just can't believe Stacey
didn't tell me
she had a boyfriend.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.697
Zack, I am so sorry.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.732
I don't know what to say.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.868
I... I...

12:48.902 --> 12:50.937
Craig showing up
was a total surprise

12:50.970 --> 12:52.739
and now that she likes you,
she's in a bind.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.909
- Yeah, in a bind.
- But we know she
likes you much more.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.510
Much, much more.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.046
Give her time, I'm sure
she'll get it under control.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.949
Yeah, yeah, under control.

13:03.049 --> 13:07.754
- You really think so?
- Yes, I do.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.924
Maybe you're right. I'll talk
to her tomorrow.
Thanks, Jessie.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.560
You're welcome.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.262
- Good night.
- Lisa: See you.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.501
Okay, bedtime. lf I don't get
at least eight hours sleep,

13:21.534 --> 13:24.270
you don't want to know me
tomorrow, honey.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.875
Everyone understand
what they're supposed to do?

13:28.908 --> 13:31.411
What's this
ceremony all about?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.813
You'll see when it happens.
One last thing, Zack,

13:33.847 --> 13:37.350
l want you to hold this box.
When I say,
''Give me the box,''

13:37.384 --> 13:40.286
give me the box, got it?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.956
Ooh, tough.
Maybe I should
write that down.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.395
What's going on, Craig?
Why did we have
to come here again?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.630
You've been so distracted
ever since I arrived

13:50.663 --> 13:53.466
that I thought this ceremony
might cheer you up.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.404
What ceremony?
Can you excuse me?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.506
Sweetheart, you look
beautiful.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.874
Thanks, but I have
to talk to Zack.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.476
He can wait, come with me.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.547
Will someone tell me
what's going on?

14:07.580 --> 14:10.483
You are gonna be so happy,
Stacey, trust me.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.552
I know what's
best for my girl.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.821
Kelly.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.857
- Come in.
- Let the ceremony begin.

14:17.891 --> 14:21.061
We are gathered here tonight
to celebrate
something special.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.764
- Light the candle.
- Sure... Got a match?

14:25.932 --> 14:27.067
Here.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.671
Stacey,
this candle symbolizes...

14:31.705 --> 14:33.540
( sneezes )

14:34.708 --> 14:37.811
I'll start again.
Stacey, this candle symbolizes

14:37.844 --> 14:40.080
my love for you...

14:41.481 --> 14:45.418
- Not now.
- Sorry, it just felt right.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.588
Now it is time
to pass that flame
on to another man

14:48.621 --> 14:52.726
whose love for you
burns in a different way.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.096
- What am I trying to say?
- That's what we want to know.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.499
Quiet. Zack, the box.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.735
- The box, the box!
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.772
- Jeez.
- I got it, I got it.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.874
- I got it.
- I got it.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.043
( clears throat )

15:13.046 --> 15:16.950
Stacey, you are
so fair and beautiful,

15:17.050 --> 15:20.053
and so deep in love am I...

15:22.455 --> 15:24.657
Give me that!

15:24.691 --> 15:27.627
...that I will love
you still, my dear,

15:27.660 --> 15:30.864
until
the deepest sea goes dry.

15:30.897 --> 15:34.668
Oh gosh, this is all
so beautiful.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.139
I want you to wear
my fraternity pin.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.075
Now you're my girl forever.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.892
Hey, Zack, you okay?

15:58.925 --> 16:00.660
No, I'm not.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.196
I can't believe Stacey
dumped me for that frat jerk.

16:03.229 --> 16:06.366
Maybe I can help
you out there, pal.
Do what I do with Lisa,

16:06.399 --> 16:10.103
date Stacey in your mind
and you can save
a lot of money.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.042
Hey there, Lisa, I'll pick
you up at 8:00 for
the movies tonight.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.879
Is he dating me
in his mind again?

16:21.214 --> 16:23.450
- Zack, are you all right?
- What do you think?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.452
- Where are you going?
- I'm quitting.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.055
I'm not hanging around to
watch Stacey and Craig live
happily ever after.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.191
But the race is tomorrow.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.493
The Zack Morris I know
is not a quitter.

16:33.526 --> 16:39.065
Yeah, she's right. Don't let
that jerk make you look
like a total loser.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.502
Zack, you've gotta show Stacey
what kind of
guy she's missing.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.070
Don't give up.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.375
Zack!

16:48.408 --> 16:50.910
Where have you been?
I tried calling all night.

16:50.944 --> 16:54.080
Well, I thought you were
out celebrating.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.150
- We need to talk.
- ( revving engine )

16:57.183 --> 16:59.152
Congratulations
on getting pinned.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.921
I hope you and Craig
are very happy together.

17:04.223 --> 17:08.028
Hey kid, you might as well
give up now,

17:08.060 --> 17:09.262
I'll take my chances.

17:09.295 --> 17:13.599
By the way, congratulations,
you've got a great girlfriend.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.173
Stacey,
I talked to your father
about your taking tomorrow off

17:20.205 --> 17:23.443
so we could be alone.
I've got
the whole day planned.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.178
I can't,
I have to work tomorrow.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.348
Come on, your job's
not that important.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.583
But it's
important to me, Craig.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.454
All ATVs to the start line.
The race is about to begin.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.522
( cheering )

17:35.555 --> 17:38.525
Gotta go.
Wait for me right here.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.133
( crowd clapping )

17:51.571 --> 17:55.241
Carosi: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>meet our drivers.</i>

17:55.275 --> 17:57.344
<i>Jessie Spano...</i>

17:58.611 --> 18:00.680
<i>AC Slater...</i>

18:02.215 --> 18:04.184
<i>Zack Morris...</i>

18:05.251 --> 18:07.287
<i>Craig Strand!</i>

18:09.689 --> 18:12.292
<i>And Kelly Kapowski</i>.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.428
<i>Drivers, get ready...</i>

18:15.462 --> 18:18.064
<i>Get set...</i>

18:18.098 --> 18:20.433
- ( gunshot )
- Go!

18:20.467 --> 18:24.070
( crowd clapping, cheering )

18:32.579 --> 18:35.548
Lisa: Oh no,
Jessie's out of control.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.119
( muffled )
Help!

18:41.454 --> 18:42.522
( crowd cheering )

18:58.638 --> 19:01.408
One lap to go!

19:04.010 --> 19:06.613
Lisa: Zack's in the lead!
Come on, Zack!

19:25.331 --> 19:27.567
Yes! Yes!

19:27.600 --> 19:30.704
And the winner
is Craig Strand!

19:30.737 --> 19:33.173
Hey, that's not fair!

19:33.206 --> 19:35.475
Yes, oh boy, all right!
Woo!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.411
- Come on, let's celebrate.
- What you did to
Zack was unfair.

19:38.445 --> 19:42.382
So what? It's not illegal.
Come on, let's go!
Let's party!

19:48.088 --> 19:50.523
Well, Slater,
l guess you were right.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.525
Nah, don't feel so bad.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.295
You did better here
than on your driving test.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.696
I'm gonna kill you.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.836
Are you all right, Zack?
I saw what Craig did.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.172
You win some, you lose some.
It's just a game.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.241
No big deal.

20:14.347 --> 20:18.618
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:18.651 --> 20:22.155
- I have
something to tell you...
- No wait, no wait, me first.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.556
I should have
said this way before,

20:23.590 --> 20:26.926
but I was embarrassed
or afraid, I'm not sure.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.295
Stacey, no matter how
you feel about me...

20:31.197 --> 20:33.266
- I love you.
Okay, bye, have a good...
- I love you too, Zack.

20:33.299 --> 20:36.202
No... Just... I hope you're
very happy with Craig.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.373
What?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.609
I said, I love you too.

20:44.310 --> 20:48.381
The more I try to
understand girls,
the less I understand girls.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.355
I just put Craig
on a plane back to Boston,

20:55.388 --> 20:57.691
with his fraternity pin.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.759
I hope he sits on it.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.297
He tried running my life
and that's not what I want.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.470
What do you want?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.574
I want
a boyfriend who listens,

21:14.607 --> 21:17.677
who's kind...

21:17.711 --> 21:20.947
Who's funny
and who likes me for me,

21:20.980 --> 21:24.884
and isn't threatened
by uptight Eastern snobs.

21:26.753 --> 21:30.824
I think this is where we kiss.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.279
( instrumental
theme music plays )
