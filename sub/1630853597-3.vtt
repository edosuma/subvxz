WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:02.419
ABIGAIL:
Previously on Motherland.

00:02.419 --> 00:05.422
KHALIDA: Long ago, six sisters
embarked on a sacred mission

00:05.422 --> 00:07.049
to bring the power of speech
to man.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.884
This common tongue is the root

00:08.884 --> 00:10.886
of all of the world's languages.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.513
HEARST: I'll be personally
overseeing

00:12.513 --> 00:14.097
the administration
of the poison.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.557
Yeah, with my work on the Hill.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.309
And thanks to my fundraising
efforts.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.895
-We have secured their end.
-(applause)

00:19.895 --> 00:21.772
Just a little piece of work
I picked up.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.315
Nothing ever really dies.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.943
I just always wanna be able

00:25.943 --> 00:28.111
to say hi to you
wherever you are.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.280
I know why Raelle is sick. No!

00:30.280 --> 00:31.365
-RAELLE: Scylla!
-SCYLLA: Don't go!

00:32.616 --> 00:34.326
We shouldn't worry.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.370
The Mycelium has taken her
to heal.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.080
Mom?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.122
SCYLLA: That's gotta be
what they're using

00:39.122 --> 00:40.249
to poison the Mycelium.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.833
New orders.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.544
NICTE:
Are there any of them left?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.587
ABIGAIL: It's Hearst.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.798
HEARST: I noticed blondie
isn't with you.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.259
Is she feeling all right?
(grunts)

00:50.259 --> 00:52.386
ADIL:
I'll have to fight Khalida.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.221
They won't be able to see me.
-ABIGAIL: We need to go. Now!

00:54.221 --> 00:55.305
RAELLE: The last thing we need
is for the Marshals

00:55.305 --> 00:57.266
to catch one of us being here.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.100
NICTE: It's just something they
tell you to keep your mind,

00:58.100 --> 00:58.976
there's a boogeyman.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.648
(suspenseful music playing)

01:14.074 --> 01:16.785
(Abigail breathes heavily)

01:16.785 --> 01:18.787
She must've hidden somewhere.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.414
Unless the Marshals took her.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.958
Then we'll use the Blood Compass
to find her.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.002
Nothing.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.839
(whistling)

01:32.134 --> 01:33.885
That didn't sound like nothing.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.721
Raelle told us
not to underestimate them.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.849
They catch us, they take us back
to Washington in chains.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.392
It's time to make our stand.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.893
Our fight is not
with the Marshals.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.104
-You have another option?
-SCYLLA: I might.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.692
(whistling continues)

01:48.692 --> 01:50.235
You're a couple short.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.199
Go. Find Khalida. Take them.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.577
We know our way around
the Cession, we can lose them.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.704
Love your confidence, Ramshorn.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.998
ABIGAIL: The plan stays
the same. We meet out west.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.125
When Rae comes back,
how will she find us?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.668
I might know a way
to contact her.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.923
Go!

02:15.385 --> 02:17.929
Tally, this will really
make us fly?

02:17.929 --> 02:19.514
TALLY:
If it kicks in fast enough.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.017
It will.
Stay with me as we drop.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.145
You'll be okay.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.440
(tense music playing)

02:37.199 --> 02:40.077
(theme music playing)

03:41.513 --> 03:43.390
ADIL: (shouts)

03:52.983 --> 03:55.235
(grunts)

03:55.235 --> 03:56.778
Told you it'd work.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.572
You okay?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.116
Never again.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.337
(panting)

04:16.381 --> 04:17.674
Hey.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.721
I've almost lost her
so many times, Abigail.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.976
We're going to find her.
I promise.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.188
(dramatic music playing)

04:39.154 --> 04:41.239
(Adil vocalizes)

04:50.707 --> 04:54.211
She's heading north. Fast.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.970
You're saying he killed
his own daughter?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.848
Imagine what else he'd be
willing to do for the Camarilla.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.768
And you're positive about this?

05:09.768 --> 05:12.103
I tracked the plague's
rate of growth

05:12.103 --> 05:14.856
to determine the exact moment
she was poisoned.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.775
Right before her TV interview.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.194
Silver brought Alban Hearst
directly to Penelope.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
And my own Chief of Staff
is with him?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.325
ANACOSTIA:
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.494
We need to discuss how we're
going to proceed.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.041
WADE: Hmm.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.551
I want to move my Address
to the Nation to tonight.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.470
Alert the press and move
whatever it is you have to.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
That is how we will proceed.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.559
You're going to publicly move
against Silver tonight.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.144
I will announce
my veto of his bill

05:53.144 --> 05:55.605
and place Blanton
under criminal investigation.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.315
All due respect,
Madam President,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.860
but that's not what
General Bellweather had in mind.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.153
Silver is just a puppet
for the Camarilla.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.239
Come at him now
and the true leadership

06:04.239 --> 06:06.241
will slither back
into the shadows.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.785
You tell Petra that I'm sorry,

06:08.785 --> 06:10.787
but I will not abide
by this betrayal

06:10.787 --> 06:12.873
in my administration.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.833
They're not gonna let you
take him down without a fight.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.669
(scoffs)
And you should know by now...

06:20.088 --> 06:22.132
I like a good fight.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.595
We need to get back
to Fort Salem.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.388
Preparations to be made

06:28.388 --> 06:30.473
in order to secure your safety,
Madam President.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
Madam President,
Pauline Marten from The Council

06:32.809 --> 06:35.937
of The Great River is here
demanding to speak with you

06:35.937 --> 06:37.898
about the incident
at the chemical plant.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.614
You might wanna stay for this,
Captain Quartermain.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.490
(indistinct chatter)

06:59.127 --> 07:00.962
MAN: Here you go.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.173
SINGER:
♪ The day after tomorrow ♪

07:05.800 --> 07:08.261
Sometimes fate smiles on us.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.221
-What are you talking about?
-Two faces for us to wear,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.223
we can keep the parents
to drive us.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.683
No more civilians, Nicte.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.896
You need to get Raelle's voice
out of your head.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.147
Let's just get on this bus.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.774
You're giving the orders now?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.484
Please, I just need to get
somewhere safe

07:22.484 --> 07:23.777
so I can try to reach Raelle.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.195
And if she doesn't answer?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.404
She will.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.745
(engine revving)

07:40.794 --> 07:43.046
We're gonna need two tickets
to the border.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.845
(footsteps approaching)

07:50.845 --> 07:54.724
WADE: Pauline, Biindigen.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.186
Kelly, Aaniin.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.398
Your Ojibwe is improving.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.150
Since you're here,
Captain Quartermain,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.695
I'll assume you've made
the President aware

08:06.695 --> 08:08.863
of the attack in the Cession

08:08.863 --> 08:11.324
by the Bellweather Unit.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.159
You have proof it was them?

08:13.159 --> 08:16.663
The security footage
from the plant is a little dark,

08:16.663 --> 08:19.249
but your Vice President
seemed sure.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.961
You've spoken with Blanton.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.546
He offered any
and all assistance

08:24.546 --> 08:26.464
to bring them to justice.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.218
This is a personal matter
for him.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.972
I'm willing to make
the same offer.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.224
ANACOSTIA: Grant the military
access to the Cession

08:36.224 --> 08:37.767
and I guarantee you
I will personally

08:37.767 --> 08:39.185
bring them back to Fort Salem.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.439
I'm curious to know
what these soldiers

08:42.439 --> 08:44.441
have to say for themselves
first.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.735
What they have to say is
a matter of national security.

08:46.735 --> 08:51.114
Pauline, the United States
and the Cession

08:51.114 --> 08:53.742
help each another to flourish,
don't they?

08:53.742 --> 08:56.995
Not all on the Council
would agree with you,

08:56.995 --> 08:58.079
but I do.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.915
Good.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.625
Because I would hate to see

09:02.625 --> 09:05.336
anything get in the way of that,
especially this.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.967
We'll contact you as soon
as they're apprehended.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.597
These are some of the most
formidable witches I've ever met

09:15.597 --> 09:18.475
and yet you seem fairly
confident you'll catch them.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.352
You would be too, if you had
the Marshals after them.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.072
(engine revving)

09:33.698 --> 09:35.617
BUS DRIVER: We'll be
approaching the US-Dakota border

09:35.617 --> 09:37.077
in about 20 minutes.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.090
(tires screeching)

10:00.350 --> 10:02.143
I'm sorry, folks.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.229
This will just take
but a minute.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.566
How did he find us?

10:08.566 --> 10:11.903
Stay calm.
He hasn't found us yet.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.739
(suspenseful music playing)

10:32.632 --> 10:34.509
How do you do, ladies?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.513
(whistles)

10:47.313 --> 10:50.275
(tense music playing)

10:55.238 --> 10:56.281
Hmm.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.369
ABIGAIL: Wait, Adil,
we can't just walk into town.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.914
We're going too slow.
Khalida hasn't stopped once.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.958
I don't think we can go
any faster.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.712
What if it wasn't the Marshals?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.964
The Camarilla
could've taken her.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.300
-She might not even be...
-If they did take her,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.510
then I feel bad
for the Camarilla.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.771
We're losing her.
We need a new strategy, now.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.565
Can you get us to where
Khalida's going to be?

11:30.565 --> 11:32.192
I can't.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.276
But you've seen days ahead,
haven't you?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.153
I've only seen my own future.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.156
And even then, I didn't know
when exactly that was.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.116
Okay.
Maybe you can see ahead to,

11:40.116 --> 11:41.784
to after we've found her.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.411
We can work backwards
from there.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.332
Tally, please.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.583
Please try.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.052
(exhales deeply)

12:03.431 --> 12:06.601
(indistinct chatter)

12:06.601 --> 12:11.648
TALLY:
We're walking up to this place.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.401
-ADIL: Busy night.
-ABIGAIL: Could be a trap.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.446
Two Rivers Road House.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.405
What about Khalida?

12:20.949 --> 12:22.408
(exhales deeply)

12:22.408 --> 12:25.245
(indistinct chatter)

12:27.330 --> 12:29.666
No. I don't see her.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.000
Please, Tally, Tally.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.168
Like I said, it wasn't safe.

12:32.168 --> 12:36.130
Please, please, keep going.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.466
(sighs)

12:44.764 --> 12:47.475
ABIGAIL: Take your medicine,
Tally Craven.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.018
You've got work to do.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.813
What is it?
What are you seeing?

12:54.816 --> 12:56.359
Uh...

12:56.359 --> 12:57.986
Do you see her?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.654
KHALIDA:
(echoing) Abigail.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.531
(indistinct chatters echoing)

13:03.741 --> 13:07.453
(echoing) Abigail,
you may want to slow down.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.206
(gasps) I saw Khalida.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.458
Was she all right?

13:12.458 --> 13:17.672
Yeah, she was, uh,
we were inside the Road House.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.258
You saw Khalida in a bar?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.135
I mean, it was not like
she was drinking,

13:22.135 --> 13:23.678
I think. I don't...

13:23.678 --> 13:25.555
We passed through a town
called Two Rivers

13:25.555 --> 13:27.807
on the way
to the chemical plant.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.850
It's not far.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.566
KARA: Albie.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.904
You're late.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.907
Gosh.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.952
You look awful.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.042
My apologies.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.586
It took longer than I'd hoped
to get out of the Cession.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.047
You must be tired.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.344
Please, sit.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.356
Oh, I just can't imagine
what you've just been through.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.153
They caught us
completely unaware.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.989
I don't know how they knew
about the processing.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.494
My, my.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.455
Now, I'm no fancy doctor
like you,

14:34.123 --> 14:37.168
but I believe those girls
broke your nose.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.172
Ow!

14:41.172 --> 14:43.508
You swore that running
our operation

14:43.508 --> 14:45.134
out of the Cession
would be less trouble.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.262
Is that how you would
describe your mess?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.139
-I'm so sorry.
-Tell me, Alban,

14:50.139 --> 14:53.142
after they finished slaughtering
your men yet again,

14:53.142 --> 14:55.311
after they had you running
for your life like a coward,

14:55.311 --> 14:58.523
how do you feel?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.733
-Like a failure.
-KARA: Uh-hmm.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.737
I failed you.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.322
I failed the cause.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.158
(sighs)

15:09.158 --> 15:12.995
We all stumble sometimes,
Albie.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.498
But with our crusade
finally at hand,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.834
we cannot afford any more
of your failures.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.293
Do you understand me?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.087
It won't happen again.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.296
Good.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.805
Now, there have been
some critical developments

15:30.805 --> 15:32.890
at the White House.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.393
Poor Blanton is gonna need
my guidance now more than ever

15:35.393 --> 15:38.020
and I cannot babysit
the both of you.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.037

It's time.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.963
(panting)

16:51.844 --> 16:53.512

16:53.512 --> 16:54.722
We should keep moving.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.582
Charming.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.167
I'm sure you've dealt
with worse.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.045
Look, there's a moldy old
mattress there

17:26.045 --> 17:27.338
with your name on it.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.052
All right.

ahead again?

No. This is precisely
what I saw.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.895

33:04.316 --> 33:06.026
TALLY: There's something
I have to tell you.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.779
The Camarilla are searching
for the First Song too.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.991
Then there's truly
no time to waste.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.336
Are you all right?

33:24.336 --> 33:25.629
Well done.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.965
Thank you.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.592
ABIGAIL: Tally!

33:30.592 --> 33:31.676
(gasps)

33:31.676 --> 33:33.553
(heavy breathing)

33:35.597 --> 33:37.349
(pants)

33:37.349 --> 33:38.266
Tally!

33:40.185 --> 33:41.978
There's no point in struggling.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.272
It's stronger than any Work
you might wanna try.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.274
(breathes heavily)

33:46.274 --> 33:49.819
So don't bother resisting,
Tally Craven.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.407
What should we do?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.159
Alder...

33:56.159 --> 33:58.995
(suspenseful music playing)

34:24.604 --> 34:26.564
WADE: In this solemn moment,

34:26.564 --> 34:30.026
the very union of our country
will be tested,

34:30.026 --> 34:33.154
a union that was formed
in the face of tyranny

34:33.154 --> 34:38.785
so long ago by statesmen,
scholars, warriors, patriots.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.120
No one enters this room but me.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.706
WADE: And among them, witches.

34:42.706 --> 34:46.001
But today,
we face a different tyranny.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.798
(breathes heavily)

34:51.798 --> 34:53.550
It's only a matter of time
before they make their move.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.176
-Remember, once it starts...
-I know.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.177
I'll be fast.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.472
Good luck.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.682
Check in every five minutes.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.656
Renegade is secure.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.991
Everyone's in position.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.576
I never liked this part.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.830
Waiting for the enemy
to go first.

35:23.830 --> 35:27.083
Hey, at least this time,
we'll see them coming.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.377
Yeah.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.301
Stay close, all right?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.179
I always am, boss.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.324
Elayne, that stage
ain't gonna strike itself.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.702
Elayne, you all right in there?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.050
What the hell?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.764
(gasps, pants)

36:37.070 --> 36:39.906
(ominous music playing)

36:41.241 --> 36:42.701
NICTE: Hey.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.244
This thing's cutting off
my circulation.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.412
THE MARSHAL: Don't care.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.214
Doesn't look like a jail.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.924
Astute observation.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.384
You must be the smart one.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.010
(scoffs) I am.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.721
And I would just love

37:02.721 --> 37:04.097
to learn that Whistle sometime.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.691
I know who you are.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.819
You think you're special because
you started a revolution?

37:17.819 --> 37:21.072
My dog is a better
pack leader than you.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.574
And she can whistle.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.442
Probably not the reunion
you were hoping for, huh?

37:57.442 --> 37:58.860
Just give us a moment
to explain.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.653
Yeah, explain to me
just how long

38:00.653 --> 38:03.281
you thought you could elude us
on our own land?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.867
We never intended to bring
trouble into the Cession.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.703
That's exactly what you did.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.413
ABIGAIL:
What are you gonna do with us?

38:10.413 --> 38:11.456
Hmm.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.552
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.054
(chuckles)

38:28.473 --> 38:30.016
Who's he kidding?

38:30.016 --> 38:31.351
I'm not spending
a single night here.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.477
ABIGAIL:
And good luck with that.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.604
The place is warded.

38:34.604 --> 38:37.065
Even Adil and Khalida couldn't
blow a hole through the walls.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.025
Not for lack of trying.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.693
NICTE: Happy?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.070
Looks like you'll have
all the time in the world

38:42.070 --> 38:43.404
to look for your missing
girlfriend now.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.781
ABIGAIL: Back off, Batan.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.324
None of us planned for this.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.367
NICTE: Oh, that's obvious.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.160
Hey, you okay?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.205
What happened out there?

38:52.205 --> 38:54.999
NICTE: She got us caught,
that's what happened.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.584
What about Raelle?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.169
ABIGAIL:
Were you able to contact her?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.630
(sobs) No.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.634
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.177
I'm so sorry.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.097
(dramatic music playing)

39:09.097 --> 39:11.182
(sobbing)

39:16.145 --> 39:17.647
Woodlot, check in.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.155
Woodlot, now is not
the time to go silent.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.118
(suspenseful music playing)

39:30.118 --> 39:31.578
Captain Quartermain, check in.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.462
Anacostia.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.964
Ana--

39:42.964 --> 39:45.800
(suspenseful music playing)

39:56.352 --> 39:58.146
The breach has occurred.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.231
Hold your positions
and be ready.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.694
I need our exit path
cleared now!

40:04.694 --> 40:07.739
Renegade stays in place
until I say otherwise.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.742
(tense music playing)

40:12.410 --> 40:13.494
It's the camera crew.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.038
Find them, now.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.501
PRODUCER: Going to live coverage
in four, three...

40:21.961 --> 40:23.504
Stay with us,
as the President...

40:23.504 --> 40:26.132
-(explosion)
-(screams)

40:27.675 --> 40:30.511
(suspenseful music playing)

40:53.368 --> 40:56.245
(dramatic music playing)
