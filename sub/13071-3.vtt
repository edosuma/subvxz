00:00.968 --> 00:02.703
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:02.736 --> 00:05.706
* Remember how there was
a meteor from outer space? *

00:05.739 --> 00:07.241
* Brain-eating space bugs
roam around *

00:07.275 --> 00:08.809
* As if they own the place

00:08.842 --> 00:10.811
* Red Wheatus
is controlled by them *

00:10.844 --> 00:13.047
* But Gareth, Luke and Laurel
aren't yet *

00:13.081 --> 00:14.715
* Does Laurel like him?
Kinda, sort of *

00:14.748 --> 00:16.117
* Maybe yes, she does

00:16.150 --> 00:17.518
* They rocked the Tax Prom

00:17.551 --> 00:19.253
* It's the lamest prom
that ever was *

00:19.287 --> 00:21.589
* They scheme
against each other *

00:21.622 --> 00:23.491
* And they end up
with some feelings *

00:23.524 --> 00:25.093
* They regret

00:25.126 --> 00:26.694
* Laurel sees two old friends

00:26.727 --> 00:28.162
* For a while she pretends

00:28.196 --> 00:30.298
* But Abby isn't
who she used to be *

00:31.832 --> 00:33.501
* Something really isn't right

00:33.534 --> 00:35.336
* She went crazy overnight

00:35.369 --> 00:38.106
* Now she's having Stacie
back for tea *

00:38.139 --> 00:40.141
* Ella calls
for Luke's replacement *

00:40.174 --> 00:41.609
* Scarlett thinks
that sex is gross *

00:41.642 --> 00:43.344
* Gustav starts investigating

00:43.377 --> 00:45.213
* When a second head explodes

00:45.246 --> 00:47.148
* That's all the time I have

00:47.181 --> 00:48.716
* Because this episode's
too long. *

00:54.288 --> 00:56.690
(birds chirping)

00:56.724 --> 00:59.093
(distant traffic sounds)

01:02.563 --> 01:03.831
MONARCH (on TV):
A wild

01:03.864 --> 01:05.333
presidential primary,

01:05.366 --> 01:07.501
government shutdown,
leadership change,

01:07.535 --> 01:09.703
death of
a supreme court justice;

01:09.737 --> 01:12.106
it's been a crazy
last few months.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.774
And now to help
make it all clear,

01:13.807 --> 01:16.210
is one-time Bush speechwriter,
Norah Moody.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.010
Thanks for being with us, Norah.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.213
Norah, you've been
a keen observer

01:19.247 --> 01:20.681
for many years.
(cell phone buzzing)

01:20.714 --> 01:22.116
(phone beeps on)

01:22.150 --> 01:24.185
Ella, I thought
we weren't talking.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.519
ELLA:
I thought so, too,

01:25.553 --> 01:29.390
and yet, I woke up
to a lovely peace offering.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.625
Did you send
something to Ella?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.161
Flowers.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.862
The card reading,
"Let's not fight."

01:34.895 --> 01:36.630
I'm glad you got them.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.632
You know I hate that we're
at each other's throats.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.868
So let's not be.
Makes sense to me.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.536
Look, I have to go on
DoubleSpeak in a minute.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.205
How about we talk
before the caucus?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.873
Uh, unfortunately,
I have a bit of a cold.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.675
I might stay home to recuperate.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.709
Well, tomorrow, then.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.478
Get better and we'll talk.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.845
Bye-bye.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.747
(phone beeps off)

01:53.781 --> 01:55.649
You're a genius.
(chuckles)

01:55.683 --> 01:58.352
I was talking
to a Mexican friend of mine,

01:58.386 --> 02:01.755
Abundio, who sells newspapers
at Union Square.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.225
And he was saying that he likes
the government shutdown.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.626
BROADBENT: Because no one can
see that government

02:05.659 --> 02:07.161
does anything for them.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.329
LUKE: Ask Abundio
about health inspectors.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.764
Ask him about the food he eats.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.167
Well, my guess would be
he'd have a lot to say...

02:13.201 --> 02:14.935
in Spanish.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.670
BROADBENT: Frankly,
that's the kind of response

02:16.704 --> 02:17.905
that I find deeply...

02:17.938 --> 02:19.407
(blowing nose)

02:19.440 --> 02:22.443
Mr. Broadbent, as Senator
Wheatus's chief of staff,

02:22.476 --> 02:24.245
isn't it your boss's
hard line

02:24.278 --> 02:26.214
that's keeping the government
from opening?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.481
(laughing):
Of course not.

02:27.515 --> 02:32.220
If you look back, at the
shutdowns of 1981, 1982,

02:32.253 --> 02:36.224
and even... uh...

02:36.257 --> 02:37.325
What's up with number two?

02:37.358 --> 02:38.792
Yeah, get him a glass of water.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.228
Keep going, Claudia.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.829
Uh, Senator Healy,

02:41.862 --> 02:42.930
you have your own
troubles, don't you?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.365
Isn't Ella Pollack
challenging you

02:44.398 --> 02:45.866
for the whip position?

02:45.899 --> 02:48.202
Uh, no. In fact, I just
got off the phone with Ella.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.803
We have great professional
respect for each other.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.539
Oh, come on, Claudia.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.940
The Democrats are
the ones in disarray.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.342
Look back

02:54.375 --> 02:56.377
at the shutdowns
of 1983...

02:56.410 --> 02:58.312
Yes, the shutdowns of the '80s
The Democrats
had a slim majority.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.282
were nothing like
the shutdowns today.
All right, and in...

03:01.315 --> 03:02.383
This is an ideological
Look, can I finish?

03:02.416 --> 03:03.851
crusade.
The Democrats had...

03:03.884 --> 03:05.719
This is so sad.
This is hostage taking.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.987
When I was working
at the White House...

03:07.020 --> 03:08.188
BROADBENT:
Would you stop yelling?!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.358
...fresh-cut flowers from
a wonderful Guatemalan woman.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.725
Red Wheatus's
mouthpiece...

03:11.759 --> 03:12.993
And if you subtracted...

03:13.026 --> 03:14.862
(all talking over each other)

03:14.895 --> 03:16.230
And if she
were watching

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
this today,
she would be saying,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.301
"Dios mio."
Dios mio.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.735
Uh, cut the feed,
uh, eight second delay.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.870
Cut it!

03:22.903 --> 03:24.472
(all talking over each other)

03:24.505 --> 03:25.706
(long beep)

03:25.739 --> 03:28.576
(snoring)

03:36.016 --> 03:38.352
(choir singing
in foreign language)

03:41.589 --> 03:43.591
(choir continues singing,
rhythmic clapping)

03:45.393 --> 03:46.594
(singing continues
over speakers)

03:46.627 --> 03:48.762
It's Palm Sunday,

03:48.796 --> 03:50.431
the procession is yet to come,

03:50.464 --> 03:51.999
but the evening
is getting late,

03:52.032 --> 03:53.601
and I've been invited to stay.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.768
(knocking on door)

03:54.802 --> 03:56.304
Laurel.
(singing stops)

03:56.337 --> 03:58.472
The FBI agent is here.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.007
The... who, Onofrio?
Yes.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.376
Still with his flag pin.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.582
Hi.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.318
You want to give me another
one of your business cards?

04:10.351 --> 04:13.521
Ms. Healy, hello.
Uh, this is Agent Blades.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.823
Can we ask you
a few questions?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.024
Sure.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.492
Uh, would you like to sit down?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.827
No.
Yes, thank you.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.830
I know you told
Agent Onofrio

04:22.863 --> 04:24.698
about what happened
in the ambulance

04:24.732 --> 04:27.501
with Dr. Daudier
last Tuesday,

04:27.535 --> 04:29.403
but could you repeat it for me?

04:29.437 --> 04:30.671
Sure.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.606
Um, I was holding

04:32.640 --> 04:35.376
Dr. Daudier's hand
on the way to the hospital.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.311
And he was
having trouble thinking.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.379
He said there was

04:38.412 --> 04:39.380
something in his ear.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.748
What was in his ear?

04:40.781 --> 04:41.749
He didn't know.
He didn't know

04:41.782 --> 04:43.384
or he didn't say?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.084
Get them out!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.953
He didn't say,

04:45.986 --> 04:49.423
so my guess
is that he didn't know.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.458
Why? What-what happened?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.059
There was another
incident.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.762
After Dr. Daudier said

04:54.795 --> 04:56.730
there was something
in his ear,

04:56.764 --> 04:58.366
you claim...

04:58.399 --> 05:02.102
his head spontaneously...
combusted?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.371
Can't you do anything?

05:03.404 --> 05:04.938
Yes.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.341
What incident?
BLADES: And you saw this happen?

05:08.376 --> 05:09.977
I did.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.346
Anthony, what's going on?

05:12.380 --> 05:13.781
There was another
spontaneous combustion

05:13.814 --> 05:15.048
on a talk show
this morning.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.017
What show?
DoubleSpeak.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.353
My brother was on DoubleSpeak.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.354
I know--
it wasn't him.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.623
It was Red Wheatus's man.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.358
Don't worry.
What?

05:24.392 --> 05:25.893
It happened
in a remote studio.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.395
I mean, your brother
didn't even see it.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.630
N-n-no. Red Wheatus's man?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.499
If we could get back
to Dr. Daudier,

05:31.532 --> 05:32.866
ma'am.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.135
I'm... I'm sorry.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.103
I have to... I have to go.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.505
I'll be... I'll be...

05:41.442 --> 05:43.677
(low, indistinct conversations)

05:53.053 --> 05:55.456
GARETH:
Laurel.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.125
What's wrong?

05:59.460 --> 06:02.095
Nothing, um...

06:02.129 --> 06:03.831
Weren't you on DoubleSpeak?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.065
Uh, last minute change.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.500
Chief of staff did it.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.735
Why?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.437
I just... I... (sighs)

06:09.470 --> 06:11.004
I thought it was you.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.506
Why, what's wrong?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.508
Did your brother
rip the guy a new one?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.745
Hey, wait.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.814
What?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.483
Nothing.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.152
Um, have you been in touch
with your chief of staff?

06:25.185 --> 06:26.954
No.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.656
Why, do you need
to speak with him?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.858
The FBI was in my office,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.093
and they said
that the staffer

06:33.126 --> 06:37.565
who was on Claudia's show
this morning... died.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.833
And I thought it was you.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.875
Well, I'm in shock,
I mean, that's terrible.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.543
Are you sure?

06:49.577 --> 06:52.045
Jonathan's dead--
a stroke.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.482
Mm-hmm.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.516
(cell phone ringing)

06:55.549 --> 06:56.784
(phone beeps on)

06:56.817 --> 06:58.051
Hello.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.520
LUKE:
Where are you?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.489
I'm upstairs, why?
I need you

07:01.522 --> 07:02.723
to get down to the office--
there's some constituents

07:02.756 --> 07:04.525
in the waiting room.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.093
Did you hear what happened
on DoubleSpeak this morning?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.528
Yeah, with Red's man,
it's bizarre.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.530
A stroke.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.964
No.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.100
LAUREL: What?
LUKE: Yeah, that's what I heard.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.703
I got to go, Laurel.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.638
Hey, Ella?

07:17.671 --> 07:18.972
How are you?
I thought you were sick.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.674
I got better.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.144
(whistles)
Let's get started.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.846
Let's go.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.249
Thanks, Ella.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.519
You'll have to teach me
how to do that, sometime.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.986
(members chuckling)

07:33.020 --> 07:34.588
Just a short update.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.089
The Republicans have overreached

07:36.123 --> 07:37.658
with their budget demands

07:37.691 --> 07:38.992
and are now hurting
their presidential chances.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.095
Yes, the Republicans
have overreached,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.498
but we are responsible.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.600
Sure, go ahead.
Our compromise

07:46.634 --> 07:49.136
put a bullet
in the terrorist's gun.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.605
Uh, the Republicans
are not terrorists.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.606
Why are you defending them?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.842
Uh...
It's exactly that attitude

07:54.875 --> 07:57.277
of appeasement that has
encouraged the Republicans.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.646
I'm not appeasing,
I'm saying

07:58.679 --> 08:01.014
this hyperbolic language
hurts us.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.182
(scoffs)
I want to play this smart.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.851
We can't just be the party
of "no."

08:03.884 --> 08:05.185
Why can't we be?

08:05.218 --> 08:06.687
Seriously.
Ella.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.657
Why must we always be
the party of adults?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.559
(scattered applause)
Let me just say this,

08:11.592 --> 08:15.529
I will never, ever
compromise my ideals,

08:15.563 --> 08:17.565
and that is why
you should make me whip.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
Can you say the same thing

08:19.600 --> 08:21.635
about Senator Healy?

08:21.669 --> 08:24.071
(applause)

08:25.272 --> 08:27.675
(door opens)

08:27.708 --> 08:29.276
LAUREL:
Hi.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.078
I'm Senator Healy's
constituent case worker.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.080
I will be meeting
with you one at a time

08:33.113 --> 08:35.549
to go over your issues.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.850
Nice saddle.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.586
Okay, let's see.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.021
Uh, Dr. Bobb.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.856
Dr. Bob... Bobb.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.024
GUSTAV:
Yes.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.093
Here.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.595
So y-your first
and last names are "Bob"?

08:47.628 --> 08:48.596
Yes.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.863
Why?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.064
Oh, it's just different.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.199
No, it's the same.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.300
Just like everyone else here,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.669
just the same.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.073
So what can the Senator
do for you, Dr. Bobb?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.341
You're Laurel Healy.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.776
I am.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.312
And your email is
healgirl31@gmail?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.347
It is-- did you need
to send me something?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.683
(choir singing
in foreign language)

09:09.717 --> 09:11.284
(singing stops)
Sorry.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.219
Melanesian Choir?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.688
Yes, you know it?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.023
Not many people listen to it.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.658
I know.
I don't even listen to it,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.593
and I listen to everything.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.797
So how can I help you,
Dr. Bobb?

09:23.831 --> 09:25.999
Oh, um...

09:27.367 --> 09:29.336
The government's too big,
don't you think?

09:30.738 --> 09:31.739
Too big?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.373
Yes, can he make it smaller?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.375
Okay.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.977
Is that it?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.746
Yes, thanks.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.180
(clears throat)

09:40.213 --> 09:41.348
(door opens, closes)

09:41.381 --> 09:42.683
RED:
Hey, everyone.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.351
For those of you
who haven't heard,

09:44.384 --> 09:47.755
Jonathan Broadbent tragically
left us this morning.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.257
So Gareth will be
my new chief of staff.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.393
That's right,
good job.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.197
He's been kicking the
Democrats' butts for weeks now.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.398
(phone ringing)
Thank you, sir.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.700
Yeah, it's me.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.735
When?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.036
You're kidding.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.738
(laughing):
Good news.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.907
Good news. Uh-huh.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.010
Uh, yeah, no, I'm on it,
I'm on it with my staff.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.712
(laughing)

10:11.745 --> 10:14.214
Ella is challenging Luke
for whip.

10:14.247 --> 10:19.753
God, how the Democrats love
the circular firing squad, huh?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.288
So, who do we want?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.857
Which one, Luke or Ella?

10:23.891 --> 10:25.392
Luke, the compromiser.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.661
I heard Ella's going
full liberal warrior.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.729
Gareth.
No.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.230
We want Ella.
RED: And why?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.065
Our Republican moderates

10:32.099 --> 10:33.801
stay on the reservation
if their only option

10:33.834 --> 10:35.268
is to go
to a liberal extremist.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.671
RED:
Right, Luke is
the danger here.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.807
No Republican flees to Ella,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.041
but they might flee to Luke,

10:41.074 --> 10:43.276
so what should
my statement be?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.411
I'll write it--
we support Ella.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.446
(Red making buzzer sound):
Gareth.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.081
Sir.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.683
(reporters clamoring)

10:49.717 --> 10:51.885
Well, it pains me
to watch the Democrats

10:51.919 --> 10:54.087
turning on each other this way.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.090
I hope they come to their senses
and stand with Luke Healy,

10:57.124 --> 10:59.426
who is someone I know
we can work with.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.460
Damn it.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.062
Senator Pollack, though

11:02.095 --> 11:04.464
a lovely woman,
is the kind of San Francisco

11:04.497 --> 11:05.833
tax-and-spend liberal

11:05.866 --> 11:06.834
who, frankly, terrifies us.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.868
They're coming after me.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.469
They want Ella.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.904
What's this?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.472
SCARLETT:
Cherry blossom season.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.842
I cut a few
to cheer up the office.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.443
Oh. Okay, thanks.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.045
Uh, check the votes.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.080
See if we still have
our three vote cushion.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.148
So, what are you saying?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.482
It's like reverse psychology?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.717
Republicans want something,

11:23.751 --> 11:25.085
Democrats automatically don't.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.320
What do you want me to do?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.756
Get rid of these.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.357
It's like
a funeral home in here.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.393
Where are you going with those?

11:33.426 --> 11:35.262
I'm taking them outside.
Why?

11:35.295 --> 11:36.363
I cut them for Luke.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.131
He doesn't want them.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.904
You never liked me, did you?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.806
I don't think I have an opinion.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.276
You're outnumbered.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.879
I am?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.013
By who?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.748
Whom.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.951
By the people
you are outnumbered by.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.129
Don't turn around.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.364
I said don't turn around.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.766
Dr. Bobb?
No,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.935
not Dr. Bobb.
Gustav.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.837
I need to know if
I can trust you.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.505
You left your e-mail
on my Web site.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.340
That was your video

12:20.373 --> 12:21.942
of a bug?
Do you have a cell phone?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.911
Yes, why?

12:26.313 --> 12:28.015
Put it in here.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.950
No.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.518
For security reasons.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.153
It's not on.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.154
It doesn't matter.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.355
The NSA can use it

12:35.388 --> 12:36.824
to broadcast up to 50 feet.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.459
You're not getting
my cell phone.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.361
(sighs)

12:42.996 --> 12:45.198
(whispering):
Bugs are eating
people's brains.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.167
What?
I said,

12:47.200 --> 12:50.337
bugs are eating people's...

12:55.542 --> 12:57.410
How do you know?

13:08.889 --> 13:09.890
Have you heard of the screwworm?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.992
The...
Cochliomyia

13:12.025 --> 13:13.193
hominivorax.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.461
It's a bug
about this size

13:14.494 --> 13:16.263
that feeds on
human flesh.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.166
Uh, hominivor is Latin
for "eater of man."

13:19.199 --> 13:20.868
This bug,
the screwworm,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.269
that's what was on
your video?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.237
A subspecies, not one
I'm familiar with.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.506
It burrows through the skull,
which forces brain tissue

13:26.539 --> 13:28.475
out through the ear,
which leads to behavioral

13:28.508 --> 13:30.510
and personality anomalies.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.212
What anomalies?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.281
People lose portions
of their memory

13:34.314 --> 13:35.849
and their ability to think.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.418
Memory is the only way
to get through to them.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.354
Can it make people more extreme?

13:41.388 --> 13:45.092
If the screwworm eats
that portion of the brain, yes.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.193
And the explosions?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.861
Why are heads exploding?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.096
(laughs)
Well...

13:49.129 --> 13:50.230
not many people
know about this

13:50.263 --> 13:51.865
but bugs fart.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.333
Oh, dear God.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.567
What? I'm not
making this up.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.236
Look it up.
It can be a buildup

13:56.269 --> 13:57.971
of methane in the brain.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.439
Then why are some
exploding and not others?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.507
I don't know.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.343
I'm just getting started, I...

14:04.611 --> 14:08.015
Why are those two men
sharing a candy bar?

14:11.919 --> 14:13.153
What?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.154
Those two men

14:14.187 --> 14:15.388
over there.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.289
One of them
took a bite

14:16.323 --> 14:17.524
of his candy bar

14:17.557 --> 14:19.392
and gave it
to the other man.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.161
That something that happens
in real life?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.296
Well, it just happened, so...

14:23.330 --> 14:25.498
The FBI compiles long books
of rehearsed activities

14:25.532 --> 14:27.034
so people will blend in.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.268
That looks like
a rehearsed,

14:28.301 --> 14:29.502
observed activity.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.404
Okay, can I have
my cell phone back now?

14:31.438 --> 14:34.241
I know this sounds crazy...

14:34.274 --> 14:36.609
but what do you think
Edward Snowden sounded like?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.478
My cell phone, please.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.050
Look.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.417
Here's my card.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.388
Look up what I said
and call me.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.258
It's all true.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.668
(muffled):
* Oh, I think that you're wild

15:01.701 --> 15:04.404
* And so uniquely styled

15:04.437 --> 15:05.638
(elevator bell dings)

15:05.672 --> 15:09.342
* You might think it's foolish

15:09.376 --> 15:12.412
* This chancy rendezvous

15:12.445 --> 15:15.415
* You might think I'm crazy

15:15.448 --> 15:16.716
* All I want *

15:16.749 --> 15:19.386
* All I want is you

15:19.419 --> 15:20.587
* Ooh, ooh

15:20.620 --> 15:22.990
* All I want is you

15:23.023 --> 15:23.991
* All I want

15:24.024 --> 15:26.393
* Is you...

15:31.031 --> 15:33.033
("You Might Think" by The Cars
continues playing)

15:38.171 --> 15:40.307
*

15:54.721 --> 15:57.357
*

16:06.399 --> 16:07.367
(knocking on door)

16:07.400 --> 16:08.368
Look at this.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.502
A real office

16:09.536 --> 16:11.371
with a door
and everything.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.405
Hi, Dad.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.406
What are you doing here?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.474
Uh, your brother

16:14.507 --> 16:16.309
needs help with Ella.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.610
How's Mom?
Good.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.412
Give her a call when
you have the chance.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.447
So...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.115
you went to the Tax Prom

16:22.149 --> 16:23.216
a few nights ago, I hear.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.551
I did, yeah.
And I hear

16:24.584 --> 16:27.054
you went with
a Republican staffer?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.688
I did that, too, yes.
And drank

16:28.721 --> 16:30.457
and you danced.
Your surveillance

16:30.490 --> 16:31.458
is getting better, Dad.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.559
Not surveillance, dear.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.061
Friends.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.428
I have a lot
of concerned friends.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.097
Well, you can tell
your "concerned friends"

16:37.130 --> 16:39.166
that this was a favor
I was doing for my brother.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.069
You went on a date with Red's
chief of staff as a favor?

16:42.102 --> 16:46.373
He's not his chief of staff and
it wasn't a date... and yes.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.075
He was just promoted.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.809
Do you know
how easily things

16:49.842 --> 16:51.478
get misunderstood in this town?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.479
Talk to Luke about it then, Dad.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.480
It wasn't my idea.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.747
Actually, no,

16:54.781 --> 16:56.283
don't talk to him.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.417
It was my idea.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.419
In fact...

16:59.452 --> 17:01.388
Look, Laurel,
I know you hate

17:01.421 --> 17:05.625
being told anything but the town
has changed; it's toxic now,

17:05.658 --> 17:07.227
and socializing
across the aisle

17:07.260 --> 17:08.395
can be misunderstood.
Hey, it's Laurel.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.497
Just wanted to call
to congratulate you

17:10.530 --> 17:11.531
on your promotion.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.832
Chief of staff, wow.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.334
Oh, come on, Laurel,
there's no one on the phone.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.335
You're just playing.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.669
I'll be right with you, Dad.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.638
Wanted to see if I could
take you out to celebrate.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.241
I...

17:21.274 --> 17:22.675
Sure.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.445
If you don't mind going
to this wake first.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.214
A wake?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.448
Sounds great.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.418
See you then.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.586
Okay.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.390
Why do you take such pleasure in
rebelling against your family?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.259
Because my family
takes such pleasure

17:39.292 --> 17:40.560
in trying to control me.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.263
LUKE:
Son of a bitch!

17:43.296 --> 17:46.433
The Healys do have a sad history
of womanizing.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.434
Oh, my God,
she went there.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.735
It's a different time.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.537
Kennedys would have
been crucified today.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.871
We'll have to go after her hard.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.872
Very hard.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.141
Mm, no, no.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.244
Sorry, sis, I need you.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.212
Does she have any
nanny problems,

17:59.246 --> 18:01.514
parking tickets,
uh, racist remarks?

18:01.548 --> 18:03.683
Uh, just rumors, no proof.
Why do you need proof?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.452
Just say she kills puppies
and call it a day.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.453
Laurel,

18:06.486 --> 18:07.454
why don't you
take a break?

18:07.487 --> 18:08.321
No, wait.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.390
End of the last session,
Ella was crying.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.391
She confided in me.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.525
She had to put her dog down

18:12.559 --> 18:14.561
just before the recess.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.662
Oh, my God, are you serious?

18:15.695 --> 18:16.796
Just before the recess

18:16.829 --> 18:18.231
so she was either going

18:18.265 --> 18:19.632
on vacation or back home to...

18:19.666 --> 18:21.168
BOTH:
...raise money.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.635
Right, I mean,
either way, it's good.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.337
She hurries to put
her dog down so she

18:24.371 --> 18:26.506
can go have
fun... where?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.541
Paris.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.243
No! (laughs)
(laughing):
Yes, she was going

18:30.277 --> 18:31.544
to Paris.
(laughing): No.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.612
No.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.846
It's like watching two ghouls.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.782
She kills her dog
so she won't

18:35.815 --> 18:37.184
miss her trip to Paris.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.185
Mm.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.486
You couldn't write that better.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.653
So, we need to leak it.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.688
Where, hmm?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.390
Reliable source? Roll Call?

18:43.423 --> 18:44.424
Do you need

18:44.457 --> 18:45.692
anything, Senator?

18:45.725 --> 18:46.826
Yes, we need to leak a story.

18:46.859 --> 18:47.827
Who do you know at the Post?

18:47.860 --> 18:48.828
Actually, Luke,

18:48.861 --> 18:50.230
do you have a second?

18:50.263 --> 18:51.398
Yeah, just give
me a minute.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.432
No, now, please.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.637
As I was walking back
from lunch,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.906
I saw Scarlett in Ella's office.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.374
Why?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.375
I don't know.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.543
Was she just
there or...?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.445
No, she was conferring
with Ella.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.314
Is there a reason

19:07.347 --> 19:09.316
Scarlett would
turn Judas?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.452
Maybe.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.622
Well, you can't
fire her now.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.860
(no audio)

19:25.298 --> 19:26.666
I can't let her
leak the story.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.500
She'll just tell Ella.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.636
Who do you know
at Roll Call?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.872
(sighs)

19:35.508 --> 19:36.743
Yes?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.379
Here is what I love
about Republicans:

19:39.412 --> 19:41.681
They're like the kids
on The Brady Bunch.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.551
(audience laughter)

19:45.952 --> 19:47.687
Stacie, hey.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.821
Laurel. How are you?
Good.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.457
Thanks for coming
to meet me.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.658
So...

19:51.691 --> 19:52.759
you had a story
for Roll Call?

19:52.792 --> 19:53.760
I did.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.794
Here, got you your usual.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.596
Vodka martini.
Thanks,

19:56.629 --> 19:59.399
but I think I'm going
a little bit lighter tonight.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.700
Seltzer and lime.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.602
(laughs)

20:02.635 --> 20:05.772
In my entire life, you've never
had a seltzer in a bar.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.240
Don't do that.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.941
Don't do what you did with Abby.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.977
What I did...

20:11.010 --> 20:12.512
Stacie, I'm not trying to...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.013
Yes, you are.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.749
You made Abby think it was
her problem but it wasn't.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.551
It's your problem.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.720
I already apologized
to Abby and...
What are we gonna do

20:20.753 --> 20:22.422
when the Republicans
take over?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.391
The Republicans

20:24.424 --> 20:26.593
are like Gilligan's Island.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.860
Take over what?
Did you know

20:27.894 --> 20:29.662
Denmark's child poverty rate

20:29.696 --> 20:31.531
is, like, a quarter
of America's?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.599
No.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.733
They have guaranteed

20:33.766 --> 20:35.835
childcare until a child is 50.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.605
That makes no sense, Stacie.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.806
Gilligan!

20:39.839 --> 20:41.674
(laughs)

20:41.708 --> 20:43.876
(laughter, applause on TV)

20:51.718 --> 20:53.286
You know what I was
thinking about yesterday?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.721
College.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.356
Remember college?

20:56.389 --> 20:57.624
Our dorm room.
There are only

20:57.657 --> 20:58.725
three gun deaths every year

20:58.758 --> 21:00.393
in Finland. Three.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.729
Remember we had those boys over?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.664
What was the name of
that-that boy you dated

21:04.697 --> 21:05.898
that first year?

21:05.932 --> 21:06.899
Was it Jim?

21:06.933 --> 21:07.934
The poet.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.769
Jim, Jim, Jim something.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.538
He came over
that first day.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.605
Guy.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.973
Guy...

21:14.006 --> 21:15.342
Guy Sostatia.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.676
Right.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.812
40% of commuter trips

21:19.846 --> 21:21.814
in Copenhagen
are by bicycle.
Stacie.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.651
Remember he broke up with you?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.653
And you said it was the
worst night of your life

21:26.686 --> 21:28.020
and you cried
and I hugged you.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.823
You do remember that, don't you?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.792
He broke my heart.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.461
Why are you doing this?

21:34.494 --> 21:35.462
Just want to know you remember.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.463
Why would I want

21:36.496 --> 21:37.630
to do that?

21:37.664 --> 21:38.998
Trump could be president.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.869
Yes, but you still
have to live, Stacie.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.371
You still have...

21:46.072 --> 21:47.840
Stacie.
I don't like
getting emotional...

21:47.874 --> 21:49.709
T-there's...
and I don't think it's fair.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.744
no, there's-there's something
coming out of your ear.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.646
That's just... uh...

21:53.680 --> 21:55.715
I got my ear pierced
and it got infected.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.850
No, no, it's coming
from inside your ear.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.652
That's just blood. Ouch.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.120
I need antibiotics.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.655
Did any bugs get near you?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.090
I just got my ear pierced, okay?

22:04.123 --> 22:06.125
I got to go and
get it looked at.
Stacie...

22:06.158 --> 22:07.760
I'm your best friend.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.961
We said we'd always
be here for each other.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.697
I'm here.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.704
(phone beeps, line ringing)

22:17.737 --> 22:20.773
Hello, it's Laurel.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.742
I want to talk.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.421
(indistinct chatter)

22:34.454 --> 22:35.822
LAUREL:
Thanks for meeting.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.800
What happened?

22:47.834 --> 22:51.704
I saw a friend,
and something was leaking

22:51.738 --> 22:53.840
from her ear.
Brain matter?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.174
I don't know.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.043
She was crying,
and for a second there,

22:57.076 --> 22:58.611
it seemed like she
was herself again.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.079
Until the brains
were pushed out?

23:00.112 --> 23:01.981
I don't know.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.717
What?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.888
We're being watched.
Don't look.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.957
Two guys texting
by the elevators.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.862
How much of this stuff
do you make up?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.864
I don't know
what you mean.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.165
I have a very sane job.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.900
I have a very sane life.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.735
Makes it hard to believe
what you say is true

23:22.769 --> 23:23.870
when you mix it in with
all this crazy stuff.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.104
You looked up screwworms.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.639
It's what I said,
isn't it?

23:26.673 --> 23:28.207
It's been eradicated
from the United States.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.809
Yes, but global warming
is expanding

23:29.842 --> 23:31.110
microclimates
for bug populations.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.112
Why is everybody listening
to the same song?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.947
What?

23:34.981 --> 23:37.950
People are listening to "You
Might Think" by The Cars-- why?

23:37.984 --> 23:40.887
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.622
Don't look at me like
I'm the crazy one.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.724
Where are we going?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.826
To see someone who
agrees with you.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.228
Who is he?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.997
LAUREL:
Gustav.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.099
His friend was the person
who died in the CAT scan.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.635
GUSTAV:
I did a marijuana study here
a few years ago.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.137
It went badly.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.574
Give him a chance.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.209
Okay.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.944
So, this is

24:04.977 --> 24:07.046
the first CAT scan.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.048
Before...
Dots.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.918
Yes, the tech said that
these kind of image

24:11.951 --> 24:14.186
artifacts can happen
with normal wear and tear.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.022
Can you enlarge the central
left lateral ventricle?

24:18.891 --> 24:20.760
More.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.162
Mm-hmm.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.065
Now, can you push
a touch superior and rostrally

24:26.098 --> 24:28.067
to the ventricle?
Have you worked
with a CAT scan before?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.669
Uh, no, but I read a lot.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.571
May I?
Sure.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.041
(clears his throat)

24:35.074 --> 24:37.710
Take that.
Mm-hmm.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.179
(tapping keys)

24:40.212 --> 24:42.081
What is that?

24:42.114 --> 24:44.250
Do you have a cell phone?
In my locker.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.786
Is that locker more
than 50 feet away?
Why?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.220
The NSA can turn
on your phone

24:48.254 --> 24:50.122
to broadcast anything
within 50 feet.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.625
Yes.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.594
It is more
than 50 feet away.
Are you sure?

24:54.627 --> 24:56.028
Yes, I am sure.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.697
What is that?

24:57.730 --> 25:00.099
A mandible.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.969
Senator?
(whirring loudly)

25:03.002 --> 25:04.537
Senator, sir...

25:04.571 --> 25:06.973
Oh, hey, buddy.
What do you need?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.207
Peace of mind.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.175
(chuckles)
Oh, can't give you that.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.843
Hmm.
What else?

25:10.877 --> 25:12.612
Grassroots are...

25:12.645 --> 25:14.146
We're at 20% approval,

25:14.180 --> 25:16.248
because we haven't made
our case to the grassroots.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.650
We're four years away
from running.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.151
Yeah, we are,
but not the president.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.553
Ah, you think
we're hurting Trump?

25:20.587 --> 25:22.121
Yeah, you need
to get the American

25:22.154 --> 25:23.723
Conservative Union on board,

25:23.756 --> 25:25.558
the Conservative Caucus,
the Family Research Council,

25:25.592 --> 25:27.126
and you're
not gonna like this.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.160
I can't wait.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.195
Reopen the government.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.663
Show we can lead.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.099
Why did you come to D.C.?

25:33.132 --> 25:34.901
To get something done.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.202
And what did you
want to get done?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.704
Low government.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.071
More incentives
for small businesses.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.740
Smart use of taxes.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.742
And have you accomplished
any of those things?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.310
No.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.679
Me, neither,
and you know why?

25:46.713 --> 25:49.181
Because colleagues
keep arguing for patience.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.150
Let's get our ducks

25:51.183 --> 25:52.284
in a row first.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.886
Well, you know what?

25:53.920 --> 25:57.023
The ducks are in a friggin' row!

25:57.056 --> 25:59.025
Even if I have to hold
a machete to their throats,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.993
those ducks are
lining the hell up!

26:01.027 --> 26:02.929
You understand?
Yes, sir.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.197
Then help me line the ducks up.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.936
(indistinct chatter)

26:09.969 --> 26:12.805
Those of us who knew Johnny
knew that he was

26:12.839 --> 26:16.643
good to lobbyists--
am I right?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.044
Yes!
No, no, no.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.912
But a lot of you
chief of staffs....

26:19.946 --> 26:21.981
No, because
she walked out on me.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.617
I didn't have a chance.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.052
Look, I'll get her
back, but I'm sure

26:26.085 --> 26:28.955
there's another
reporter at Roll Call.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.723
Hey, can we get two more?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.225
Okay.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.094
Well, you made it.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.362
I said I would.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.631
May I...?

26:38.665 --> 26:39.899
(chuckles)

26:39.932 --> 26:41.634
Bad day?

26:41.668 --> 26:43.736
I don't even know anymore.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.638
You need a reporter
to leak to at Roll Call?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.409
You see that reporter over there
with the bad cardigan?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.944
That's Howard.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.113
He's a columnist
at Roll Call.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.082
Hey, free advice.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.721
(phone buzzes)

27:03.856 --> 27:05.291
Yes, Senator, good evening.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.859
I've changed my mind.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.160
You were right.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.129
We need the grassroots.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.331
I want you to come in tomorrow

27:12.364 --> 27:14.734
with five strategies
for reaching them.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.402
Uh, definitely, sir.
Thank you.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.004
Nah, thank you, boy.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.973
(line beeps)

27:21.007 --> 27:24.877
Uh, could you bring
two more of those, too?

27:24.911 --> 27:26.946
Wow, that was easy.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.914
Yeah?
Yeah.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.850
To your first leak.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.051
(both chuckle)

27:32.084 --> 27:33.352
So, what happened?

27:33.385 --> 27:34.854
You seem happier.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.188
Uh, my boss called.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.924
Things are good now.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.426
Which means
I'm in trouble.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.861
Uh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.731
We're, uh, both
playing with fire here.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.034
So, do you know why I called?

27:48.067 --> 27:49.101
Me?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.937
No. Why?

27:50.970 --> 27:53.906
My dad said we were observed
at the Tax Prom.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.408
Doing what?
Drinking

27:56.442 --> 27:59.278
and dancing.
Oh, my God.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.113
Do you think

28:01.147 --> 28:04.350
we're being... observed here?

28:04.383 --> 28:07.887
I think it's a distinct
possibility.
Yeah?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.989
Yeah.
Well,

28:10.022 --> 28:12.491
better give 'em something
to talk about.
* She'll be invisible

28:12.524 --> 28:14.927
* Like you want her...
Like what?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.330
Hmm.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.966
(inhales sharply)

28:19.999 --> 28:21.968
I don't think
that's gonna do much.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.171
Hmm. Take it
to the next level?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.007
Which is?
Hmm?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.976
(laughing):
Um...
(laughing)

28:30.009 --> 28:31.310
I'm not drunk enough.
No?

28:31.343 --> 28:33.379
No.
Oh.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.748
Well, like a message
from God.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.919
Mm.
* You just like her
where she's at *

28:41.788 --> 28:43.455
Oh.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.991
* And you'll thank her
Hmm.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.893
* For the things
she bought you *
Aah.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.896
(sniffles, sighs)
Hmm.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.765
Hey.

28:52.799 --> 28:57.770
* Then you'll go
on your way... *

28:57.804 --> 28:59.171
(sniffles)

28:59.205 --> 29:01.073
Hey. Take this seriously.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.009
It's hard work.
I know. I'm sorry.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.844
Okay.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.846
* And the next day

29:06.879 --> 29:09.982
(laughing)
* When you chase
the other girl *

29:14.053 --> 29:18.390
* She'll remember
all the things you said *

29:18.424 --> 29:21.027
* To her...

29:32.972 --> 29:34.974
(clears her throat)

29:36.608 --> 29:38.945
Laurel, wait.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.413
What are you doing?
I'm going home.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.015
That wasn't anything back there,
all right? That was joking.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.117
Oh, I know. I-I just need
to get back to work.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.986
Look, if we leave it like this,

29:47.019 --> 29:48.888
if you leave, then it
will mean something,

29:48.921 --> 29:51.858
so, stay, and it
won't mean anything.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.494
I can't figure out the
algebraic psychology of that,

29:55.527 --> 29:58.197
so... good night.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.899
Okay.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.171
(sighs)

30:05.204 --> 30:06.572
I showed it
to the chief resident.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.441
He still thinks it's an
artifact, not a mandible.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.377
Well, they're not gonna
believe it

30:11.410 --> 30:14.046
until we give 'em a real one.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.915
What are you doing?

30:15.948 --> 30:18.417
Nothing.
This line may not be secure.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.219
I'll get in touch
with you later.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.555
(quietly):
Oh, yeah...

30:23.589 --> 30:26.859
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing)

30:28.127 --> 30:29.595
(tape scraping)

30:31.630 --> 30:34.066
(sighs)

30:43.109 --> 30:45.144
MISTY (on TV):
Civil war among the Democrats

30:45.177 --> 30:47.279
continues to heat up
as Roll Call reports

30:47.313 --> 30:50.316
that Senator Ella Pollack
euthanized her dog

30:50.349 --> 30:51.884
before taking a luxurious trip
to Paris.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.552
(Misty chuckles)

30:53.585 --> 30:56.488
Good job, Laurel.
I just leaked it.
I didn't do anything else.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.926
Not since Mitt Romney tied a
carrier to the roof of his car

30:59.959 --> 31:01.627
Mitt Romney.
has a politician been
so cavalier.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.062
Luke.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.230
LUKE:
Senator. Sorry.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.965
This is terrible.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.533
(laughing)
Not really.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.634
I knew

31:08.667 --> 31:11.070
you were doing it.
Oh, and, uh,

31:11.103 --> 31:13.572
watch the news.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.007
What does that mean?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.575
Well, I was prepared for this.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.946
Watch the news.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.581
God. People are
getting weird.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.683
LAUREL:
What does she know?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.919
Nothing.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.455
She's bluffing.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.063
(Red laughing boisterously)

31:37.096 --> 31:38.630
What channel?
RED:
45.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.266
Got to love
the Democrats.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.301
(laughing):
Yeah.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.536
MISTY (on TV):
Breitbart was the first
to break the news.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.405
The affair started
two years ago

31:46.438 --> 31:49.008
when Luke Healy promoted
his legislative director,

31:49.041 --> 31:51.610
Scarlett Pierce,
to chief of staff,
(sighs)

31:51.643 --> 31:54.313
a decision that certainly
raised eyebrows at the time.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.382
All this despite the fact that

31:56.415 --> 31:59.718
Senator Healy is still married
to his first wife

31:59.751 --> 32:02.321
and has a child on the way.
(laughing)

32:02.354 --> 32:03.722
The affair with Senator Healy's
chief of staff

32:03.755 --> 32:05.391
(door closes)
apparently started

32:05.424 --> 32:06.625
during the summer recess.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.227
Your thoughts, Norah.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.528
NORAH:
This kind of personal attack,

32:09.561 --> 32:11.330
going after
a politician's private life,

32:11.363 --> 32:12.531
it's a political hit job...
No. No, no, no. No.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.400
Please. Please.
I don't even
want to hear it.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.435
Wait. It's-it's not
want it seems.
I don't want
to hear it.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.636
Well, it's not true...
Get out!

32:17.669 --> 32:20.172
What they're saying is not true!
Get out of here! Get out.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.640
You disgust me.
You disgust me.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.543
MISTY: But should it?
(crying)

32:24.576 --> 32:27.013
I mean, shouldn't one look
You bastard.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.381
at the policies he supports
and not the personal behavior?

32:29.415 --> 32:30.716
NORAH:
Let's be honest.
You bastard.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.218
It's a question of character.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.353
If he does this
to the people he loves,

32:34.386 --> 32:35.554
how can he be trusted?

32:40.492 --> 32:43.062
* You might think
it's foolish *

32:43.095 --> 32:45.531
* This chancy rendezvous

32:45.564 --> 32:47.099
* You might think *

32:47.133 --> 32:48.534
* You might think I'm crazy

32:48.567 --> 32:50.302
* All I want *

32:50.336 --> 32:53.572
* All I want is you

32:53.605 --> 32:56.275
* Ooh, ooh,
all I want is you *

32:56.308 --> 33:01.280
* All I want *
* All I want is you.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.150
(thumping)

33:04.183 --> 33:05.517
(song begins again)

33:05.551 --> 33:07.519
*

33:14.093 --> 33:15.194
(door opens)

33:18.497 --> 33:20.399
(door closes)

33:22.268 --> 33:24.170
* Oh, well, you might think
I'm crazy... *

33:24.203 --> 33:25.237
(meows)

33:27.773 --> 33:31.210
I hate when women cry.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.712
There's a way to fix that.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.282
Don't give me crap,
please, not now.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.384
I just need a moment of peace.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.287
(sighs)

33:41.320 --> 33:42.454
I love Germaine.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.356
She's everything
to me.

33:44.390 --> 33:47.293
Look, I-I make mistakes,

33:47.326 --> 33:49.261
okay?
And I'm here,

33:49.295 --> 33:50.729
working late,

33:50.762 --> 33:53.232
and my head gets clogged

33:53.265 --> 33:56.568
trying to figure out what
concurrent resolution 45-B

33:56.602 --> 33:58.304
has to do with a real person.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.209
And I see someone smiling...

34:03.242 --> 34:06.845
just the whiff
of her shampoo,

34:06.878 --> 34:09.281
the way her hair
comes down over one eye...

34:09.315 --> 34:11.183
(sighs)

34:11.217 --> 34:13.819
How do you describe in prose
something that's poetry?

34:13.852 --> 34:16.188
It's not poetry,

34:16.222 --> 34:18.224
it's sleeping around
on your wife.
Oh, God.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.192
When did you become this way?

34:20.226 --> 34:22.394
Not everything's
about morality.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.729
I mean, are you always
immune to this?

34:23.762 --> 34:26.198
No.
Well, then, get in
touch with that person.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.299
All right? The human being

34:27.333 --> 34:28.534
who understands
why something happens,

34:28.567 --> 34:30.669
not just that it shouldn't.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.738
(sighs)

34:32.771 --> 34:34.406
So what now?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.541
What's happening
in the Senate?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.709
Oh. (scoffs)
That's over.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.845
The female senators
are lined up against me.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.847
That's why Ella played
the womanizing card.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.482
I needed their six votes.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.352
What if I talked to them?

34:46.385 --> 34:47.686
The female senators,

34:47.719 --> 34:49.721
what if I talked to them
about you?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.157
I couldn't ask you to do that.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.626
Okay, then don't ask me.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.868
Ms. Healy, hello. How are you?

35:02.901 --> 35:05.304
I'm good.
Please come in.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.874
We're all ready
to hear from you.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.612
So, first, you talk to
the American Conservative Union,

35:13.645 --> 35:15.381
then Eagle Forum.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.149
These are the top
grassroots organizations

35:17.183 --> 35:20.186
needed in order to...
You know how people build
a coalition?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.920
Foster communication?
Share ideas?
No, no, no.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.622
They compromise.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.291
I don't understand.
That's how they build

35:25.324 --> 35:27.659
a big tent, through compromise.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.361
But we're not gonna do that.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.197
We're gonna build
our own grassroots,

35:31.230 --> 35:33.199
from the ground up.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.202
There aren't 100 different ways
to get what we want.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.669
There's only one way.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.671
And what's that?

35:39.705 --> 35:43.342
(chuckles)
Our way.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.878
We need a grassroots
organization we can create

35:46.912 --> 35:48.880
and control.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.882
We'll call it...

35:50.916 --> 35:53.419
the One Wayers.

35:53.452 --> 35:56.655
Get on it
right away.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
Get on what?

35:58.857 --> 36:01.627
Astroturfing.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.529
Be careful.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.963
Yes. Thank you.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.399
I am being careful.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.539
Do you want me to do it?
No.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.474
In fact,

36:15.507 --> 36:18.610
I want you to sit there.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.619
Your dad died?

36:28.820 --> 36:30.789
Yeah.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.824
I'm sorry.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.827
Thanks.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.630
Your friend?

36:38.664 --> 36:40.632
Yeah.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.669
We can figure
this out.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.876
There it is.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.979
Alive or dead?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.781
Dead.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.484
You caught...

36:58.517 --> 37:01.353
a Blattella germanica,
a cockroach.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.289
That's it?
Yep.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.291
Do you want it back?
(exhales)

37:05.324 --> 37:07.993
That means they're
still in my apartment.
What?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.695
The screwworms.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.599
(indistinct chatter)

37:17.303 --> 37:19.738
Thank you.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.608
LAUREL:
Luke, call me.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.877
It went well.
Really well, actually.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.480
I think you may have the votes.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.320
BLADES:
Ms. Healy,

37:34.353 --> 37:36.455
do you mind coming with us?

37:36.488 --> 37:38.757
Why? Uh, what's going on?

37:38.790 --> 37:41.026
We just need a moment, ma'am.
Please hand me your phone.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.329
I'd rather not.
Yes,

37:43.362 --> 37:45.531
but I insist.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.865
I'm supposed
to meet my brother.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.734
Please, ma'am.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.480
(door opens)

38:06.051 --> 38:07.753
Hello.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.621
My brother'll be
wondering where I am.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.690
If you...

38:11.723 --> 38:13.725
(door closes)

38:34.613 --> 38:36.582
Hello?

38:36.615 --> 38:39.050
I work for Senator Healy.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.020
(door opens)

38:49.561 --> 38:51.563
Please sit down.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.370
You do know my brother's
been expecting me for an hour?

39:09.848 --> 39:12.818
What do you know about CHIs?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.820
I don't...

39:14.853 --> 39:16.822
What are CHIs?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.791
Catastrophic head injuries.
What can you tell us about them?

39:19.825 --> 39:21.827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.834
You witnessed one CHI

39:28.867 --> 39:30.902
in an ambulance, then you called

39:30.936 --> 39:32.804
one of our agents
about another--

39:32.838 --> 39:34.706
Oscar Foster,

39:34.740 --> 39:36.542
who died in a CT
scan machine.

39:36.575 --> 39:39.010
So I'm not sure how you can say
you know nothing about them.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.046
I didn't know
they were called CHIs.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.083
Why did you call
Agent Onofrio?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.685
Because he asked me to call
if I knew anything.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.787
And what did you know?

39:48.820 --> 39:52.491
Is this how this works--
you pull me off the streets

39:52.524 --> 39:54.092
and drag me into
this anonymous building

39:54.125 --> 39:55.994
and start questioning me
without a lawyer?

39:56.027 --> 39:58.997
When we told you about
John Broadbent dying from a CHI,

39:59.030 --> 40:01.066
why did you leave your office?

40:13.812 --> 40:15.814
Thank you.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.019
(door closes)
I'd like to go now.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.821
Did you leave
because you were

40:22.854 --> 40:25.156
upset about him dying?
I'd like to leave now.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.026
No. I'm not sure

40:28.059 --> 40:30.161
why you're making this
contentious, Ms. Healy.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.898
We just have a few
questions about CHIs.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.533
Please sit down.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.901
No, thank you.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.703
You were seen

40:37.736 --> 40:39.671
talking to
an African-American man

40:39.705 --> 40:41.707
outside the Library of Congress.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.742
Who was that?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.011
(door opens)

40:47.746 --> 40:49.748
Anthony?

40:51.583 --> 40:53.552
Ms. Healy. Hello.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.922
Please, sit back down.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.857
BLADES: Who was the
African-American man

40:58.890 --> 41:00.559
you talked to outside

41:00.592 --> 41:02.828
the Library
of Congress?

41:06.965 --> 41:08.534
What do you think?

41:08.567 --> 41:09.835
I don't know.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.136
I think we keep her overnight.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.638
LUKE:
Where's my sister?

41:12.671 --> 41:13.939
Excuse me?

41:13.972 --> 41:15.607
You're illegally
holding my sister.

41:15.641 --> 41:16.908
No, she's a witness.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.143
We're questioning her,
that's all.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.845
Oh, well, then she's free to go.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.079
We got a call,
Senator.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.614
A terrorist group
taking credit

41:22.648 --> 41:23.849
for these CHIs.

41:23.882 --> 41:24.950
Yeah, what group?

41:24.983 --> 41:27.252
That's... confidential.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.621
I understand.
Well, then make an appointment

41:29.655 --> 41:30.922
and ask her your questions.

41:30.956 --> 41:32.958
Seriously?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.693
You want to do this
with someone who sits on

41:34.726 --> 41:36.094
the appropriations committee?

41:36.127 --> 41:39.064
The people who control
your budget?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.973
Laurel?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.641
Thank you.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.109
Hey, it's like
when Dad was hauled off

41:51.142 --> 41:52.878
for that Abramoff thing.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.813
Yeah. You were pretty
great in there, though.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.982
Charging in--
"Do you have my sister?"

41:57.015 --> 41:58.850
Yeah. It was heroic.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.919
(phone rings)

42:00.952 --> 42:02.854
I can't believe this--
he's trying to call me.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.556
Anthony.

42:04.590 --> 42:05.891
What a bastard.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.826
He was the one
flirting with you before?

42:07.859 --> 42:09.260
Yeah. I sure know
how to attract

42:09.294 --> 42:11.897
the winners, don't I?
Son of a bitch.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.565
He was the one who called me

42:13.599 --> 42:14.933
to tell me
you were being questioned.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.968
Anthony?
Yes.

42:19.771 --> 42:20.872
Hey, by the way,

42:20.906 --> 42:23.842
Ella backed down.
Good job.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.644
Yeah, she's not challenging me
for whip anymore.

42:25.677 --> 42:26.978
What? Since when?

42:27.012 --> 42:29.114
An hour ago.
Your talk worked.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.582
You must have
told the story

42:30.616 --> 42:32.017
about me carrying you
in the snow.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.084
Yup.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.753
I almost cried.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.221
Really.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.256
I love you, sis.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.929
No one got killed today.
That's a plus.

42:43.962 --> 42:47.065
* You might think it's foolish

42:47.098 --> 42:49.067
* This chancy rendezvous

42:49.100 --> 42:51.036
(cat meows)
* You might think *

42:51.069 --> 42:53.038
* You might think I'm crazy

42:53.071 --> 42:54.773
* All I want *

42:54.806 --> 42:56.842
* All I want is you

42:56.875 --> 42:58.644
(meows louder)

42:58.677 --> 43:00.145
* All I want is you

43:00.178 --> 43:01.613
* All I want *

43:01.647 --> 43:05.216
* All I want is you.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.020
(softly):
Damn.
