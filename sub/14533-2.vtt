Mrs. Puquette:
Day in, day out,
I make Justin a sandwich,

18:14.792 --> 18:16.000
and these other boys

18:16.000 --> 18:17.542
just go right ahead
and smash it.

18:17.542 --> 18:20.166
They're being monsters
to him, Mr. Gamby.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.542
Mr. Gamby?

18:23.834 --> 18:24.917
Uh, okay, ma'am, well,

18:24.917 --> 18:26.333
I'll-- I'll be sure
to take care of it.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.208
We won't have to worry
about this problem ever again.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.250
Well, you've done
a piss-poor job so far.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.333
Are you in charge
or discipline or aren't ya?

18:33.333 --> 18:36.291
I mean, who the hell is
even running this school?

18:36.291 --> 18:37.500
Dr. Brown:
Oh, my gosh!

18:37.500 --> 18:40.625
Oh, Lord!
My house is on fire!

18:40.625 --> 18:42.834
(Dr. Brown sobs)

18:42.834 --> 18:44.708
My house!

18:44.708 --> 18:48.708
My house!
My house is on fire!

18:48.708 --> 18:50.333
Oh! Let me go!

18:50.333 --> 18:52.667
No, don't touch me!
My house is on fire!

18:52.667 --> 18:54.708
Did she say
her house was on fire?

18:54.708 --> 18:56.166
Dr. Brown:
It's on fire!

18:56.166 --> 18:57.708
Did who say?

18:57.708 --> 18:58.834
(neighing)

18:58.834 --> 19:00.250
(overlapping chatter)

19:12.417 --> 19:13.417
(phone trilling)

19:13.417 --> 19:15.166
Voicemail:
You've reached Lee Russell.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.041
Please leave a message.
Be well.
(beep)

19:17.041 --> 19:18.375
Okay, Lee,
I'm not really sure

19:18.375 --> 19:19.708
why you're blowing
me off, all right?

19:19.708 --> 19:20.708
But you need to call me back

19:20.708 --> 19:21.875
as soon as you get
this message,

19:21.875 --> 19:23.208
you son-of-a-bitch.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.708
This is Neal Gamby.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.583
This is about, uh--
to do with stuff at school.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.959
(announcer speaking)

19:32.250 --> 19:33.917
Got you a corn, Neal.
I'm not hungry.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.417
I didn't ask for that.
No thank you, Ray.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.291
We were just talking to that
idiot who runs this place.
Andy.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.458
He says that
you're $800 behind

19:40.458 --> 19:41.625
in stable fees.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.583
Well, there's obviously
some sort of processing lag

19:43.583 --> 19:45.041
with his computer systems.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.208
Look, it might not
matter much anyway,

19:47.208 --> 19:48.500
because Janelle's been saying

19:48.500 --> 19:50.250
she's not really
that into horses anymore.
Yeah.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.083
I haven't heard that.
Yeah, man.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.083
She's actually showing

19:53.083 --> 19:54.291
a little interest
in motocross.
Yeah.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.667
I've been letting her take
my 450 for a spin.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.708
Safely.
(scoffs)
Dirt bikes?

19:58.708 --> 20:00.583
Yeah.
Look, Ray,
please don't do this.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.875
You know horses
is my thing.
It's not Ray.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.750
She really wants
to do this.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.917
This is about Janelle
and what she wants.

20:06.917 --> 20:09.792
And honey, if you want
to stay relevant in her life,
Son-of-a-bitch.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.083
you're gonna get it--

20:11.083 --> 20:12.583
Next up, number 15,
What the--

20:12.583 --> 20:14.834
Janelle Gamby
riding Shadowfax.
Gamby: Hey! Hey!

20:14.834 --> 20:15.875
Hey!

20:15.875 --> 20:17.458
You have no right to be here!
Excuse you!

20:17.458 --> 20:19.417
I'm here with my daughter!
Hey! Hey!

20:19.417 --> 20:20.834
How dare you, Blythe!

20:20.834 --> 20:22.125
Mr. Gamby,

20:22.125 --> 20:24.417
about those stable fees--

20:24.417 --> 20:25.583
(grunts)
Blythe!

20:25.583 --> 20:26.917
Blythe!

20:26.917 --> 20:28.333
Blythe, I know you hear me!

20:30.708 --> 20:31.667
Blythe!

20:31.667 --> 20:33.250
You have no right
to be here!

20:33.250 --> 20:34.625
I'm with my daughter!

20:36.750 --> 20:38.458
What the fuck?

20:38.458 --> 20:40.583
What's wrong with you, man?
Are you crazy?

20:40.583 --> 20:41.875
No.

20:41.875 --> 20:42.917
You are!

20:42.917 --> 20:44.625
Staring at me weird!

20:44.625 --> 20:46.583
Everybody saw it!

20:46.583 --> 20:48.250
You better watch out!

20:48.250 --> 20:50.792
You scratched my car,
you motherfucker!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.041
(mutters)

20:53.000 --> 20:54.375
(helicopter whirring)

20:54.375 --> 20:57.125
(radio chatter)

21:03.625 --> 21:04.708
(phone trilling)

21:04.708 --> 21:06.166
Voicemail:
You've reached Lee Russell.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.417
Please leave a message.
Be well.
(beep)

21:08.417 --> 21:09.542
God dammit.

21:29.708 --> 21:30.959
(in bad accent)
Yes.

21:30.959 --> 21:32.834
Me see Lee?

21:32.834 --> 21:35.834
Uh, work-- work
at school with Lee.

21:35.834 --> 21:36.834
To see him?

21:36.834 --> 21:38.375
You're looking for Lee.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.959
Come on in.
I'll go get him.
(in normal voice) Okay.

21:40.959 --> 21:43.333
Uh, can you
take off your shoes?
Yeah.

21:49.417 --> 21:52.708
Are these, uh, heirlooms?

21:52.708 --> 21:55.125
Ancient heirlooms?
(speaking in Korean)

21:55.125 --> 21:56.166
Hmm?

22:00.125 --> 22:01.208
Mm-hmm.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.375
I just-- I'm waiting for him.
We don't have to talk to

22:05.375 --> 22:07.000
each other if you
don't want to.
I'm fine.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.333
What the fuck
are you doing
in my home?

22:09.333 --> 22:11.875
(speaks)
You need to learn how
to answer your voicemail.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.166
We need to talk.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.333
(speaking)
Alone.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.583
Mi-Cha!

22:16.583 --> 22:18.417
Christine, take
Mi-Cha outside!

22:18.417 --> 22:19.583
She wants tea.

22:19.583 --> 22:20.500
Fine.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.792
Uh... who are these people?

22:21.792 --> 22:23.959
This is my wife
Christine, Gamby.

22:23.959 --> 22:26.875
The thirsty woman who
resembles a bowl of shit rice

22:26.875 --> 22:28.500
is her mom Mi-Cha!

22:28.500 --> 22:30.333
Come on.
(speaks)

22:30.333 --> 22:31.708
(speaks)
Come on! I'm gonna get it.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.542
(continues speaking)
I'm getting it!

22:33.542 --> 22:34.917
(speaks)

22:34.917 --> 22:36.083
I'm getting it!

22:37.083 --> 22:38.250
This is fucked up, Russell.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.417
This is not what
I signed up for.

22:39.417 --> 22:41.834
Oh, please. It's exactly
what you signed up for.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.125
What, you think
taking this bitch down
was gonna be pretty?

22:44.125 --> 22:45.834
Is that what you thought?
No, but I-- I thought

22:45.834 --> 22:48.250
we'd be doing more things
like making her look bad
at her job.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.375
Like, school-related shit.

22:49.375 --> 22:51.792
Oh, we knocked that bitch
down a peg today.

22:51.792 --> 22:53.291
You know what it felt like

22:53.291 --> 22:54.834
when we were
tearing up all her shit.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.708
I saw that look
in your eyes, Gamby.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.750
You loved it.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.291
No, I went to
a very dark place.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.291
A place I have not
been to in a long while.

23:01.291 --> 23:03.959
And it was fucking beautiful.

23:03.959 --> 23:05.708
I'll be honest, Gamby,

23:05.708 --> 23:07.750
I've never had an ounce
of respect for you.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.333
I just thought
you were the lamest,

23:10.333 --> 23:11.417
dumbest person
I'd ever met.

23:11.417 --> 23:12.792
Just somebody
who was fucking nothing.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.625
Just someone who needed
to spend their whole life

23:14.625 --> 23:15.875
on a fucking treadmill.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.125
A life loser.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.625
Until today.

23:18.625 --> 23:22.125
Today I saw something
in that house.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.583
I saw your potential.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.458
Potential.

23:27.458 --> 23:28.625
Like how?

23:28.625 --> 23:30.417
(sighs)
Look, earlier today,

23:30.417 --> 23:32.625
my mother-in-law
was all up in my ass

23:32.625 --> 23:34.291
'cause her shower head broke.

23:34.291 --> 23:37.291
She told me I eat pubic hair
with pepper paste.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.000
Now, that's about
the meanest thing

23:39.000 --> 23:41.417
you could say
about somebody
in Korean.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.333
But did I get all mad?

23:43.333 --> 23:44.667
No.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.834
(glass clinks)

23:45.834 --> 23:47.000
I do this.

23:50.750 --> 23:51.834
(spits)

23:58.166 --> 23:59.500
Excuse me.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.125
(speaking Korean)

24:23.208 --> 24:24.500
Oh.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.667
Now I fucking own her.

24:26.667 --> 24:29.083
That's who I am.

24:29.083 --> 24:32.375
And that's the kind
of potential I see
in you as well.

24:34.375 --> 24:36.083
Since we're partners,

24:36.083 --> 24:39.375
it's only fair
you get your share.

24:41.792 --> 24:42.792
The fuck is this?

24:42.792 --> 24:45.375
Those are real
fuckin' diamonds

24:45.375 --> 24:46.708
set in a brooch.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.583
Where'd you get this?

24:48.583 --> 24:49.875
Where you think
I fucking got it?

24:49.875 --> 24:51.083
Fat Albert's clubhouse.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.166
Just lined my pockets.
Every single one I had.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.083
Just took whatever
it is I wanted to.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.208
Now, you can get
good money for that.
No.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.750
No. You are unbelievable.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.625
I am not doing this
for the money, Lee.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.625
Look, Gamby.

25:03.625 --> 25:07.583
What we're doing
is serious business.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.417
But it don't mean
it can't be fun too.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.708
Teacher:
As General Lee

25:16.708 --> 25:19.834
gazed on that field
of slain soldiers

25:19.834 --> 25:22.125
on that cold winter's day,

25:22.125 --> 25:25.750
he said, "It is well
war is so terrible--"
(PA beeps)

25:25.750 --> 25:27.333
Woman on PA:
Would Mr. Russell
and Mr. Gamby

25:27.333 --> 25:28.750
please report
to the principal's office?

25:28.750 --> 25:31.542
Mr. Russell and Mr. Gamby,
to the principal's office.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.417
Students:
Ooh!

25:43.250 --> 25:44.792
Don't you fucking move.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.291
Step inside, gentlemen.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.625
Do you know
why you're here?

26:04.625 --> 26:06.125
No, ma'am.
No, ma'am.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.750
You know my house burned down.

26:07.750 --> 26:08.959
The whole goddamn thing.

26:08.959 --> 26:10.750
My sons didn't even
wanna move here.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.917
Now look. Everything
they ever owned, gone.

26:13.917 --> 26:16.708
I can only imagine--
Do not interrupt me,
Mr. Russell.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.000
Let me finish.
Yes, ma'am.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.083
Now, I brought
Blythe Sason here

26:20.083 --> 26:22.125
to observe this school,

26:22.125 --> 26:27.000
and I was expecting him to
find unpleasant revelations.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.708
But after reading the report
on the two of you,

26:29.708 --> 26:32.125
I was shocked.

26:35.250 --> 26:38.625
"Mr. Gamby is no nonsense.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.166
"Whether you agree
with him or not,

26:40.166 --> 26:41.667
"he tells it like it is.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.583
"He's a man of his word.

26:43.583 --> 26:44.917
He can be trusted."

26:44.917 --> 26:48.417
"Mr. Russell is
a great leader

26:48.417 --> 26:50.750
"and a great
relationship builder.

26:50.750 --> 26:55.625
He is roundly admired
by the faculty."

26:55.625 --> 26:57.667
After completing
his analysis,

26:57.667 --> 26:59.417
Mr. Sason concludes

26:59.417 --> 27:03.291
that you two are
excellent vice principals.

27:04.458 --> 27:05.959
With everything
I'm going through,

27:05.959 --> 27:09.291
it's a comfort to know
I can trust the men

27:09.291 --> 27:10.708
standing beside me.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.291
And I want to thank you

27:12.291 --> 27:14.125
for being a bright spot

27:14.125 --> 27:16.166
on a rather bleak day.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.542
You're welcome, Dr. Brown.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.291
You may be new here,

27:20.291 --> 27:21.583
but you are family

27:21.583 --> 27:24.208
to Neal and I.
Thank you, Mr. Russell.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.708
And Dr. Brown,
if you or your boys

27:26.708 --> 27:28.792
need any toiletries
or canned goods,

27:28.792 --> 27:31.125
I don't mind going
to the corner store for you.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.166
Thank you.
I think we'll manage.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.708
Now, would you mind
praying with me now?

27:35.708 --> 27:36.834
To pray to God?

27:36.834 --> 27:38.166
Yes. Let's touch and agree.

27:38.166 --> 27:41.917
Touch and agree.
Amen. Thank you.

27:41.917 --> 27:43.875
Oh, dear heavenly Father,

27:43.875 --> 27:46.708
thank you so much
for everything

27:46.708 --> 27:48.875
you've blessed me with
in my life.

27:48.875 --> 27:52.083
Lord, this fire
is not gonna kill me.

27:52.083 --> 27:55.583
It may knock me down,
oh, but I'll get back up

27:55.583 --> 27:57.625
and I'll be stronger
than ever.

27:57.625 --> 28:02.375
Thank you for bringing me
Neal Gamby and Lee Russell.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.875
(groans)
Oh, help us.

28:04.875 --> 28:08.208
Lord, help us do
good things together.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.750
In Jesus' name...
Mm-hmm.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.583
we pray.

28:12.583 --> 28:14.000
Amen. Amen.
Amen.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.083
Amen.
Amen.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.834
Amen.

28:16.834 --> 28:19.750
Would you mind getting me
a cup of coffee?

28:19.750 --> 28:21.667
It would be
my pleasure, Dr. Brown.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.250
Thank you so much.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.583
Thank you.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.750
Wait here.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.250
(car chimes)

28:49.792 --> 28:51.083
(plop)
That should take care

28:51.083 --> 28:52.625
of what I owe
and the rest of the year.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.166
What's this?

28:57.166 --> 28:58.667
Those are real
fucking diamonds

28:58.667 --> 29:00.291
set in a fucking brooch,
you idiot.
