00:39.680 --> 00:41.360
I know how to do a lot of things.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.600
Like what?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.000
Build a dam.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.360

<i> I was pleased Alyssa used "we"</i>

02:02.360 --> 02:03.600
He was attacking you.

02:05.080 --> 02:05.960
Yeah.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.680
And those girls in the photos.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.200
We did the world a favor.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.720
If I was the police,
I'd give us fucking medals or something.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.080
They probably will.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
<i> They didn’t.</i>

02:47.480 --> 02:50.440

<i>And we were really doing something,</i>

03:00.920 --> 03:02.280
<i>And it felt good.</i>

03:05.320 --> 03:06.960
Oh, shit.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.240
Alyssa?

03:10.920 --> 03:11.880
Wake up.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.520
Have a nice day.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.560
Did he buy a key ring?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.800
No.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.480
Did you encourage him to buy a key ring?

03:31.560 --> 03:32.640
-Yes.
-Don't lie.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.600
No.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.080
Well...

03:36.360 --> 03:39.360
if you get cancer, you'll only have
yourself to blame, won't you?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.800
OK.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.920
I'll keep the engine running.
You get out, fill up, just a little bit.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.080
Enough to get to your dad's.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.600
And then we drive off
before anyone notices, OK?

04:03.680 --> 04:06.040
You've really come out of your shell,
you know.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.240
Huh?

04:07.320 --> 04:08.520
It's hot.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.880
Eight o'clock in the morning.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.640
Shit.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.080
All right...

04:37.000 --> 04:37.840
Morning!

04:38.520 --> 04:40.160
-Hiya.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.960
Nah, you're all right, thanks.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.720
You can't fill up
with the car running can you?

04:45.240 --> 04:46.080
What? Oh, yeah.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.520
Can you turn the engine off, please?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.920
Let me help you.
It's a bit temperamental that one.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.040
It's fine, thanks.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.640
-No, we only want a bit.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.760
Better to be on the safe side, isn't it?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.880
OK, sure. Fill her up.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.760
Police.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
What?

05:58.720 --> 06:00.520
Let's go in and pay, shall we?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.240
After you.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.040
<i> If this is what gets us caught,</i>
<i>I'm going to kill myself,</i>

06:18.600 --> 06:19.800
<i>from shame.</i>

06:27.160 --> 06:29.360
<i> Shit, shit, shit.</i>

06:33.520 --> 06:37.160
This young lady would like to pay
for pump number seven.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.360
Frodo!

06:45.560 --> 06:46.400
Cash or card?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.960
Like to buy a key ring? For cancer.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.600
-Not now!

06:55.880 --> 06:56.960
Cash or card?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.680
-No.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.240
-We don't have one.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.240
Yeah, we do.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.440
-Shut up!

07:05.920 --> 07:07.560
Do you want me to call the police?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.520
They might like to know
where you got your car from.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.440
I need a toilet!

07:13.440 --> 07:15.280
Get off me!

07:15.360 --> 07:16.480
-Ah!
-Frodo, call the police.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.440
I take it you recognize that.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.200
I gave it him for his birthday.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.400
Which birthday was this?

07:30.960 --> 07:31.880
His thirteenth.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.880
I’m sorry, why on earth would you
give a 13

07:36.960 --> 07:38.120
Well, he asked for it.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.640
Actually, no,
he asked for a machete.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.400
But I said that was a bit full on.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.480
This knife has been confirmed
as a murder weapon.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.200
What?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.920
Look, James...

07:53.000 --> 07:55.720
He’s weird, OK? But he's...

07:56.640 --> 07:58.080
he’s not dangerous.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.160
You let her go, or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.320
He's really not.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.040
-No.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.520
Come on, I'm interested.
My husband owns a couple.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.040
Ow!

08:18.440 --> 08:21.760
It's a Glock 17MB. Ambidextrous
magazine catch. Recoil-operated.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.840
19 rounds.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.160
<i> Yes, James!</i>

08:24.880 --> 08:27.000
Frodo, call the police.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.360
Ow!

08:32.840 --> 08:33.760
Frodo!

08:33.840 --> 08:36.520
Call the police, you fucking moron!

08:43.200 --> 08:45.000
Told you we had a toilet.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.680
Let me out!
Let me out now!

08:50.680 --> 08:52.120
Frodo!

08:52.600 --> 08:54.120
I don't like my life.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.120
So, do something.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.480
Frodo!

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
Frodo!

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
What was that?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.440
Nice one, Frodo.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.480
I'm just saying, it's a bit of a jump,
that's all.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.160
What is? Well, it's weird.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.880
It is.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.120
They steal a car
and he has a knife, sure, but...

09:41.040 --> 09:42.120
why would they kill someone?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.720
Well, he's had the knife
since he was 13 years old.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
I had an air rifle when I was ten.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.880
Nearly blinded my sister.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.440
That's interesting.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.240
What?

10:02.080 --> 10:04.280
<i> Things had started to get</i>
<i>slightly out of hand.</i>

10:04.360 --> 10:07.680
I'm going to get you arrested,
and then I'm going to sue you!

10:07.760 --> 10:08.760
All of you!

10:08.840 --> 10:09.960
Shut up!

10:10.520 --> 10:12.160
<i> We needed to get out of there.</i>

10:12.240 --> 10:13.440
-Yeah.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.160
Is that your actual name?
Like, your birth name?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.160
Yeah.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.000
Listen, Frodo, we've got
to get back on the road.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.680
OK, yeah, cool.
Where are we going?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.160
-I'm coming with you.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.360
What do we need?
Juice, snacks...

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
Frodo!

10:31.400 --> 10:32.520
For energy.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.000
Frodo!

10:37.240 --> 10:39.240
-Not really.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.760
I do. From now.  Oh, come on, Frodo!

10:44.040 --> 10:46.000
I'm just gonna start the car.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.320
He's just hot-wiring. It takes a while.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.320
Oh, OK. Cool.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.320
Do you want some alcohol?

10:57.160 --> 10:58.360
Uh, yeah, sure.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.800
Can you grab us a couple
of bottles of that whiskey on top?

11:02.880 --> 11:05.240
This one?
-Yeah, the Glen-thingy one.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.240
It's really expensive.

We're sorry to have to do this,

but we just need
to ask some more questions.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.200
Going back a few years, there was talk
among old colleagues, about accusations

12:12.280 --> 12:14.080
made against Clive by some students.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.200
-Yes. I can tell you it was a long time ago...

12:21.080 --> 12:24.280
and that both accusations were dropped.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.760
-We know that, but--
-And I can tell you...

12:28.960 --> 12:31.600
that some young women,
rather than admit

12:31.680 --> 12:34.160
their grades are dropping
because they're lazy

12:34.240 --> 12:36.000
or on drugs half the time,

12:36.080 --> 12:40.520
would rather accuse
an innocent man of sexual assault.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.680
No one would have any reason
to cause him harm?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.160
I would like it...

12:47.040 --> 12:49.720
if you would get on with your job

12:49.800 --> 12:52.280
and find whoever murdered my son.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.160
Rather than trying to blame him
for his own death.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.720
I'll show you out.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.520
Please, we'll see ourselves out.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.840
He was your only one?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.560
It's better to be in charge of the truth,
you know?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.200
In case it ever comes out.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.840
It tends to,

13:24.920 --> 13:26.840
in situations like this. It's, uh...

13:27.440 --> 13:28.920
It's just my experience.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.800
It's better to be, you know...

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
in control.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.960
Get out.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.200

<i> Hey!</i>

17:25.520 --> 17:27.640
<i>I said stay still!</i>

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
Fucking hell.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.320
Right. Let's do this.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.040
-Course I am.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.160
James, we killed a rapist,
turned our backs on the law,

17:46.240 --> 17:49.480
and I'm finally gonna meet my dad again.
It's mega. Come on.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.640
Yeah?

18:15.720 --> 18:16.800
Hi. Is Leslie in?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.360
Leslie doesn't live here anymore.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.600
<i> No.</i>

18:20.840 --> 18:21.680
What?

18:22.760 --> 18:23.640
Who are you?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.880
Do you know where he is now?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.720
Just leave it, James.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.280
Yeah.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.560
They still killed him.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.880
Whatever he might have done,

18:39.040 --> 18:41.200
they cut his throat
and they’ve done a runner.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.280
-Then they'll get manslaughter.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
Ugh...

19:01.040 --> 19:01.960
OK. I'm going home.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.560
<i> DC Noon</i>

19:06.040 --> 19:07.760
Yeah, go ahead.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.240
<i>We found the kids' most recent location.</i>

19:10.520 --> 19:11.360
Where?

19:11.720 --> 19:15.040
<i>They robbed a petrol station 100 miles</i>
<i>south east of here this morning.</i>

19:15.320 --> 19:17.680
<i>Held it up at gunpoint.</i>
<i>Locked the manager in the toilet.</i>

19:17.760 --> 19:19.000
<i>We've got the CCTV.</i>

19:19.080 --> 19:20.640
Coming in now.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.760
How do we know
this is the right way?

20:05.320 --> 20:08.240
Well, she said left
and then left again, so...

20:09.880 --> 20:11.360
I think it’s this way.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.400
<i> Sometimes you realize</i>
<i>you had a thing keeping you going</i>

20:19.480 --> 20:21.080
<i>that might be a lie...</i>

20:21.280 --> 20:23.200
<i>When you actually really understand that,</i>

20:23.280 --> 20:26.080
<i>that the whole thing might have been</i>
<i>a lie the whole time,</i>

20:26.360 --> 20:28.120
<i>it's like you swallowed a stone.</i>

20:28.960 --> 20:31.160
<i>But not recently.</i>

20:32.080 --> 20:33.680
<i>You swallowed it years ago.</i>

20:36.320 --> 20:37.800
What if this is shit?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.760
Why didn't he tell me that he moved?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.760
Maybe it's really recent.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.360
Come on.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.840
<i> I'm really scared.</i>

21:24.600 --> 21:25.680
I'm really scared.
