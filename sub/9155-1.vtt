00:28.585 --> 00:29.885
<i>Hi, I'm Alex.</i>

00:29.887 --> 00:33.187
<i>I play football for the
greatest college in the world,</i>

00:33.189 --> 00:35.324
<i>Blue Mountain State University.</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:36.791
<i>We excel at three things here,</i>

00:36.793 --> 00:39.794
<i>science, social awareness and...</i>

00:39.796 --> 00:41.562
<i>I'm kidding. It's a
straight party school,</i>

00:41.564 --> 00:43.632
<i>no one goes to class here.</i>

00:43.634 --> 00:45.867
<i>This is Sammy, he's my best friend.</i>

00:45.869 --> 00:47.903
<i>That's Donnie, he likes to drink.</i>

00:47.905 --> 00:49.671
<i>Harmon, he likes drugs.</i>

00:49.673 --> 00:51.406
<i>Mary Jo, she's a cheerleader.</i>

00:51.408 --> 00:54.242
<i>This is Larry.</i>

00:54.244 --> 00:55.278
<i>Ah, what can we say about Larry? I
don't know. We'll think about it.</i>

00:55.280 --> 00:57.178
<i>That's our coach. He's legendary.</i>

00:57.180 --> 00:58.547
<i>Oh, and this is Thad.</i>

00:58.549 --> 00:59.480
<i>He was our team captain.</i>

00:59.482 --> 01:01.182
<i>Great football player,</i>

01:01.184 --> 01:02.617
<i>terrible person.</i>

01:02.619 --> 01:04.887
<i>He just graduated and
I couldn't be happier,</i>

01:04.888 --> 01:06.754
<i>because this is my senior year.</i>

01:06.756 --> 01:08.057
<i>Without question,</i>

01:08.059 --> 01:12.128
<i>this is going to be the
greatest year of my life.</i>

03:24.027 --> 03:26.762
<i>They call him the fifty
million dollar man!</i>

03:26.764 --> 03:29.930
<i>Last month was the NFL Draft where Thad
Castle of Blue Mountain State was selected.</i>

03:29.932 --> 03:35.069
<i>Number one overall, a pick that was
widely regarded to be enormously risky.</i>

03:35.071 --> 03:38.039
<i>Now is he the most naturally gifted
linebacker we've seen since Lawrence Taylor?</i>

03:38.041 --> 03:39.741
<i>Yes.</i>

03:39.743 --> 03:42.777
<i>Is he also the least naturally gifted
when it comes to making decisions,</i>

03:42.779 --> 03:44.079
<i>off the field?</i>

03:44.081 --> 03:45.746
<i>An even bigger yes.</i>

03:45.748 --> 03:47.515
<i>I'm Dhani Jones here
with Thad Castle</i>

03:47.517 --> 03:48.550
<i>to discuss his new fame and fortune.</i>

03:48.552 --> 03:50.318
<i>Thad Castle, thanks for being here.</i>

03:50.320 --> 03:51.353
<i>You're welcome for having me.</i>

03:51.355 --> 03:53.488
<i>Thad, let's just get right into it,</i>

03:53.490 --> 03:55.424
<i>multi-million dollar contract.</i>

03:55.426 --> 03:56.692
- <i>Peanuts.</i>
- <i>Fifty million dollar signing bonus.</i>

03:56.694 --> 03:57.793
<i>Peanuts.</i>

03:57.795 --> 03:59.394
<i>Are you calling
fifty million dollars</i>

03:59.396 --> 04:00.561
<i>peanuts?</i>

04:00.563 --> 04:02.496
<i>It's a good start,</i>

04:02.498 --> 04:03.931
<i>but honestly, I expected
to be making billions.</i>

04:03.933 --> 04:05.599
<i>With a "B"?</i>

04:05.601 --> 04:06.535
<i>No.</i>

04:06.537 --> 04:07.970
<i>With a dollar sign.</i>

04:07.972 --> 04:09.537
<i>Thad, what are you gonna
do with all this money?</i>

04:09.539 --> 04:10.639
<i>Probably just...</i>

04:10.641 --> 04:12.140
<i>Make myself happy.</i>

04:12.142 --> 04:14.976
<i>Like the other day, I was
feeling so down. I almost cried.</i>

04:14.978 --> 04:17.378
<i>I went out and bought 97 guns.</i>

04:17.380 --> 04:19.047
<i>I love guns.</i>

04:19.048 --> 04:22.551
<i>I got a pistol, a machine gun,
a</i> Call of Duty <i>gun,</i>

04:22.553 --> 04:24.419
<i>a</i> Halo <i>gun.</i>

04:24.421 --> 04:26.922
<i>And I got a tank.</i>

04:26.924 --> 04:30.294
<i>I got this one gun that just
shoots for 45 seconds, straight.</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:35.996
<i>Oh, also, I bought a zoo.</i>

04:35.998 --> 04:37.965
<i>I got wolves and giraffes,</i>

04:37.967 --> 04:39.600
<i>I got monkeys.</i>

04:39.602 --> 04:41.470
- <i>Mountain lions.</i>
- Woah!

04:41.472 --> 04:43.905
<i>Saber tooth tigers. I mean,
I figure what the hell?</i>

04:43.907 --> 04:45.107
<i>If Matt Damon can buy a zoo,</i>

04:45.109 --> 04:46.508
<i>So can Thad Castle.</i>

04:46.510 --> 04:48.410
How do you like them apples?

04:48.412 --> 04:50.179
<i>I also got a dinosaur.</i>

04:50.181 --> 04:53.881
<i>It's the, ah, the big monster one
with horns growing out of its face.</i>

04:53.883 --> 04:55.049
<i>A rhinoceros?</i>

04:55.051 --> 04:56.450
<i>What?</i>

04:56.452 --> 04:58.018
<i>With the horn, a rhinoceros.</i>

04:58.020 --> 04:58.886
<i>The dinosaur.</i>

04:58.888 --> 05:00.087
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:00.089 --> 05:01.890
<i>I got one.</i>

05:01.892 --> 05:04.126
<i>Thad, talk to me about Alex Moran.</i>

05:04.128 --> 05:05.994
<i>There's a lot of talk questioning
his ability to lead the...</i>

05:05.996 --> 05:07.828
- <i>Mountain Goat team.</i>
- <i>Oh, ask me about my shoes.</i>

05:07.830 --> 05:09.498
<i>Hey, well, tell me about your shoes.</i>

05:09.500 --> 05:10.866
<i>They're called "Thadinators."</i>

05:10.868 --> 05:12.934
<i>They're like Jordan's, but in mine,</i>

05:12.936 --> 05:14.902
<i>you can run higher and jump faster.</i>

05:14.904 --> 05:18.573
<i>Isn't it a run faster
and jump higher.</i>

05:18.575 --> 05:20.441
<i>We're still working on our slogan.</i>

05:20.443 --> 05:22.176
<i>So which company is
making these shoes?</i>

05:22.178 --> 05:23.677
<i>Uh, mine does...</i>

05:23.679 --> 05:26.481
- <i>Uh, Thad Company.</i>
- <i>Thad Company.</i>

05:26.483 --> 05:28.517
<i>It's the same company
that makes my hats,</i>

05:28.519 --> 05:29.984
<i>and waterproof shirts,</i>

05:29.986 --> 05:31.953
<i>and condoms.</i>

05:31.955 --> 05:34.054
<i>And also the same
company that makes this</i>

05:34.056 --> 05:36.491
<i>Hall of Fame jacket you haven't
even asked me about yet.</i>

05:36.493 --> 05:38.160
<i>Don't you think you should wait
until you get to the Hall of Fame</i>

05:38.162 --> 05:39.760
<i>before you wear a jacket like that?</i>

05:39.762 --> 05:41.128
<i>Oh, yeah. Don't you
think you should wait,</i>

05:41.130 --> 05:43.097
<i>till you get in the Hall of Fame?</i>

05:43.099 --> 05:44.498
<i>Waiting is for pussies.</i>

05:44.500 --> 05:45.900
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

05:45.902 --> 05:48.203
<i>Thad, meet the world...</i>

05:48.205 --> 05:50.037
<i>Hey sloots, say "hi" to the world.</i>

05:50.039 --> 05:52.474
<i>Hey, world.</i>

05:52.476 --> 05:55.477
<i>World, meet Thad Castle.</i>

05:55.479 --> 05:57.212
And we're out.

05:57.214 --> 05:59.616
Somebody get my chopper!

06:03.986 --> 06:05.186
Blue 16.

06:05.188 --> 06:07.390
Blue 16.

06:18.601 --> 06:19.902
Hey, O'Brien!

06:19.904 --> 06:22.169
I'm pretty sure if that ball was
an STD you would've caught it!

06:22.171 --> 06:23.237
Sorry, coach.

06:23.239 --> 06:24.873
- Good throw.
- Thanks, coach.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.808
Let us go home.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.876
- What? What'd you say?
- Hmm?

06:28.878 --> 06:30.479
- Another? You want me to throw another one?
- No.

06:30.481 --> 06:31.612
- I could throw another one.
- Second team,

06:31.614 --> 06:32.981
get second team in there.

06:32.983 --> 06:35.484
Second team! Let's go, let's go!

06:35.486 --> 06:38.855
Then all at once I was shot out
into the light like a cannon ball.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.224
Anyway, that's how I got my kicking
shoe out of that elephant's asshole.

06:45.895 --> 06:46.895
Somebody's got to talk to coach
about these four-hour practices.

06:46.897 --> 06:47.996
This is killing me.

06:47.998 --> 06:49.164
No. We need them.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.933
Season's right around the corner.

06:51.935 --> 06:53.667
I gotta be honest with you guys. It doesn't
matter how much extra practice we have,

06:53.669 --> 06:55.703
we aren't going to do well this year.

06:55.705 --> 06:56.604
We're terrible.

06:56.606 --> 06:58.707
Whoa, we're not gonna be that bad man.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.140
We've got you and your arm,

07:00.142 --> 07:03.277
we've got my kicking leg
and we've got Donnie's...

07:03.279 --> 07:06.013
Hmm-mmm.

07:06.015 --> 07:07.849
- I wanna say muscles?
- That'll work.

07:07.851 --> 07:09.950
But three people can't carry this team.

07:09.952 --> 07:11.953
No. Right now is our time to party.

07:11.955 --> 07:13.087
Right now.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.556
It's just...

07:14.558 --> 07:16.157
I mean look at Sammy.

07:16.159 --> 07:17.792
He's been hammered since 10:00 am.

07:17.794 --> 07:19.059
He's doing it right.

07:19.061 --> 07:20.929
Hey, Sammy!

07:20.931 --> 07:23.532
Hi, buddy, how you doing?

07:23.534 --> 07:24.900
I got fucking hammered last night.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.905
I don't know what he's saying right now.

07:29.907 --> 07:30.705
- Do you understand that?
- I don't know what he's saying.

07:30.707 --> 07:31.907
He's so hammered.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.275
Sammy.

07:33.277 --> 07:35.643
You're doing it all wrong.

07:35.645 --> 07:37.177
I know you're drunk but you're
fucking it up for all of us.

07:37.179 --> 07:38.345
It's not even me.

07:38.347 --> 07:41.248
It's the fucking goddamn
goat. He's a fucking asshole.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.852
He's a goat. You're a human person.

07:43.854 --> 07:44.986
There's no rivalry here.

07:44.988 --> 07:46.054
Ouch!

07:46.056 --> 07:47.321
What the fuck, he just bit me!

07:47.323 --> 07:50.022
He did not just bite you.

07:50.024 --> 07:50.659
Billy would never bite anyone...

07:50.661 --> 07:52.092
- Aw.
- Aw.

07:52.094 --> 07:54.061
He did. He fucking bit me!

07:54.063 --> 07:55.864
Yeah, fucking go pet him,

07:55.866 --> 07:58.566
you little piece of shit!

07:58.568 --> 08:01.070
Okay, coach Summers, round them up.

08:03.873 --> 08:05.640
Round them up, like, here?

08:05.642 --> 08:08.545
Yes, right here! Round them up.

08:12.349 --> 08:14.616
So he said, "At least it
wasn't a reach around."

08:16.686 --> 08:18.986
Ha, ha, ha, ha, okay.

08:18.988 --> 08:21.022
Joke time's over. I need
you guys to round up.

08:22.191 --> 08:23.290
It's too weird.

08:23.292 --> 08:25.326
I'm sorry, it's Coach Summers now.

08:25.328 --> 08:27.195
And I need you guys to round up.

08:27.197 --> 08:29.030
Hey, can I try your hat on?

08:29.032 --> 08:29.864
- I've always wanted to wear...
- No, don't take my hat!

08:29.866 --> 08:31.900
Give me back...

08:31.902 --> 08:32.866
- All right, I'll give you your hat back.
- I need my playbook.

08:32.869 --> 08:34.001
- Give me that.
- Hey!

08:34.004 --> 08:36.037
Quit screwing around! Round up!

08:36.039 --> 08:37.605
God!

08:37.607 --> 08:40.107
You don't bone tag your coach!

08:40.110 --> 08:41.275
All right now listen up.

08:41.278 --> 08:43.345
You all know the cheerleaders.

08:43.347 --> 08:44.912
They helped me prepare a little cheer.

08:44.914 --> 08:47.715
Especially for you guys.

08:47.717 --> 08:49.318
You ready?

08:50.821 --> 08:52.720
<i>♪ You suck, you suck ♪</i>

08:52.722 --> 08:54.388
<i>♪ You suck today you suck ♪</i>

08:54.390 --> 08:57.926
<i>♪ I wanna fucking kill you
all for wasting all my time ♪</i>

08:57.928 --> 08:59.761
<i>♪ It's the worst
day of my life ♪</i>

08:59.763 --> 09:01.229
<i>♪ since my father died ♪</i>

09:01.231 --> 09:02.964
<i>♪ You suck, you suck ♪</i>

09:02.966 --> 09:03.998
<i>♪ You suck and you suck ♪</i>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.001
Oh.

09:07.203 --> 09:09.005
It's kind of catchy.

09:12.742 --> 09:14.175
Great practice today, champ.

09:14.177 --> 09:15.777
Oh, my God,

09:15.779 --> 09:17.878
I do not want to talk about practice.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.181
Yeah, neither do I. I actually need some
advice from you. And it's about a girl.

09:21.183 --> 09:23.084
I've seen the girls you get with, Mary Jo.

09:23.086 --> 09:24.319
I should be taking advice from you.

09:24.321 --> 09:26.388
No, this one's different.

09:26.390 --> 09:29.257
She's not some brainiac
PHD like I usually go for.

09:29.259 --> 09:31.258
- Okay.
- She's dumb as rocks like you usually go for.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.094
But she's so fun. It's...

09:33.096 --> 09:34.295
Really nice.

09:34.297 --> 09:36.196
Okay, well, my advice,

09:36.198 --> 09:37.965
you should bring her by the Goat House.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.701
That's the advice from
Alex Moran, king of BMS?

09:40.703 --> 09:42.403
- Yes.
- Bring her to a house?

09:42.405 --> 09:44.038
Well, it's not just a house.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.407
- It's just a house.
- It's not just a house.

09:45.409 --> 09:46.941
- It's just a house.
- It worked on you,

09:46.943 --> 09:48.409
freshman year.

09:48.411 --> 09:49.677
Fine.

09:49.679 --> 09:51.879
Maybe it worked on one smart girl.

09:51.881 --> 09:53.114
It's like an aphrodisiac.

09:53.116 --> 09:55.417
It's like oysters or money.

09:55.419 --> 09:57.185
It's magical.

09:57.187 --> 09:59.354
Fine. I'll bring her to the Goat House.

09:59.356 --> 10:02.990
I don't know, maybe I'll finger
her on the lawn or something.

10:02.992 --> 10:05.060
Well, Sammy did just
mow the lawn yesterday.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.795
- So...
- Okay, perfect.

10:06.797 --> 10:08.897
- Skin it here, Alex.
- All right.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.900
- Thanks, dude.
- Ugh!

10:11.967 --> 10:13.167
Bye.

10:18.942 --> 10:20.075
What are you doing here?

10:20.077 --> 10:21.308
It's a...

10:21.310 --> 10:24.079
...drug I'm working on.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.715
Figure if I am going to get into the
family drug manufacturing business

10:26.717 --> 10:28.148
after I graduate, I really gotta...

10:28.150 --> 10:29.450
Buckle down.

10:29.452 --> 10:30.884
Yeah, yeah. Let me have a hit of that.

10:30.886 --> 10:32.320
Oh!

10:32.322 --> 10:33.388
This isn't for everybody.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.922
It's pretty intense.

10:34.924 --> 10:36.858
Alex, what the hell are we doing here man?

10:36.860 --> 10:38.826
I have some very important drinking to do.

10:38.828 --> 10:40.829
The coach called a
meeting, he said no booze.

10:40.831 --> 10:42.330
And he's the boss.

10:42.332 --> 10:43.465
That's right, Moran.

10:43.467 --> 10:44.998
I am the boss.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.935
This is Dean Oliviar.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.002
Olivares.

10:48.004 --> 10:49.771
Say again.

10:49.773 --> 10:50.872
Olivares!

10:50.874 --> 10:52.340
Whatever.

10:52.342 --> 10:54.075
Anyway he's new here at BMS.

10:54.077 --> 10:55.476
So, I want you to sit there.

10:55.478 --> 10:57.345
And I want you to show him some respect.

10:57.347 --> 10:58.846
And stop making that face.

10:58.848 --> 11:01.749
What? This is just my face.

11:01.751 --> 11:04.284
Well, sorry.

11:04.286 --> 11:06.988
Anyway, Dean the floor is yours.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.989
What is a dean?

11:10.092 --> 11:11.392
Excellent question.

11:11.394 --> 11:14.896
A dean is like a coach.

11:14.898 --> 11:16.064
For the whole university.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.364
You could say

11:17.366 --> 11:19.500
that I am the coach

11:19.502 --> 11:21.201
of your coach.

11:21.203 --> 11:22.269
Excuse me are you saying cooch?

11:22.271 --> 11:23.537
Coach, yeah.

11:23.539 --> 11:24.404
That's a cooch.

11:24.406 --> 11:25.507
Like a female.

11:25.509 --> 11:26.774
Coach, coach.

11:26.776 --> 11:28.475
"Coach." He's saying coach.

11:28.477 --> 11:30.277
Oh, coach.

11:30.279 --> 11:31.378
Yeah. Got it.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.513
Way off on that one.

11:32.515 --> 11:34.181
As your coach,

11:34.183 --> 11:36.551
I have a big problem with your behavior.

11:36.553 --> 11:38.787
Twenty-five percent arrest rate.

11:38.789 --> 11:40.421
- Yeah!
- Drinking,

11:40.423 --> 11:43.892
drugs, indecent exposure.

11:43.894 --> 11:45.426
What I find

11:45.428 --> 11:46.927
is a house full of drunkards,

11:46.929 --> 11:48.162
prostitutes, and imbeciles...

11:48.164 --> 11:50.330
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:50.332 --> 11:52.300
We are not prostitutes.

11:52.302 --> 11:53.368
Oh.

11:53.370 --> 11:54.469
Mr. Moran.

11:54.471 --> 11:56.271
Hi.

11:56.273 --> 11:58.105
I've heard a lot about you.

11:58.107 --> 11:59.873
- Hey, congrats, man.
- Thanks, guys.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.042
The king of Blue Mountain State.

12:01.044 --> 12:02.310
The king of Blue Mountain State.

12:02.312 --> 12:03.978
I wouldn't say that.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.446
Well I got news for you, Mr. Moran.

12:06.448 --> 12:08.248
Your kingdom,

12:08.250 --> 12:09.383
has a new ruler.

12:09.385 --> 12:11.252
Me!

12:11.254 --> 12:12.452
I thought you were the cooch?

12:12.454 --> 12:15.056
I heard that the first time.

12:15.058 --> 12:16.157
You better makeup your mind.

12:16.159 --> 12:18.560
I'm the coach.

12:18.562 --> 12:22.330
But I'm going to be king just as soon
as I storm your castle, Mr. Moran.

12:22.332 --> 12:23.864
You're gonna bang Alex?

12:23.866 --> 12:25.300
What?

12:25.302 --> 12:26.868
I'm not comfortable with that.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.503
Why would you want to do that?

12:28.505 --> 12:30.338
He's not banging anybody!

12:30.340 --> 12:31.940
Now, shut up!

12:31.942 --> 12:33.441
Yeah, uh...

12:33.443 --> 12:35.409
What I mean to say,

12:35.411 --> 12:37.612
Saturday at midnight,

12:37.614 --> 12:39.214
Blue Mountain State,

12:39.216 --> 12:40.915
will seize this...

12:40.917 --> 12:42.216
Goat House,

12:42.218 --> 12:43.618
and auction it to the highest bidder.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.519
What?

12:45.521 --> 12:48.288
That you understand, don't you?

12:48.290 --> 12:50.291
You can't take the Goat House.

12:50.293 --> 12:51.325
Oh, I can.

12:51.327 --> 12:53.961
I can.

12:53.963 --> 12:57.865
This house of filth and lawlessness
is no longer yours to rule.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.567
Now if you'll excuse me.

13:00.569 --> 13:03.171
I have other students that I need to

13:03.173 --> 13:05.440
coach.

13:08.978 --> 13:10.378
Shit. Okay, all right.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.579
Okay, okay.

13:11.581 --> 13:12.946
Coach, coach,

13:12.948 --> 13:14.349
you can't let this happen.

13:14.351 --> 13:16.884
Next year is my senior year.

13:16.886 --> 13:19.253
If the team sucks, this
house is all I have.

13:19.255 --> 13:22.958
Well, then you better make
sure that the team doesn't suck.

13:24.327 --> 13:25.926
Just gonna have a beer,

13:25.928 --> 13:28.495
we're gonna have a beer and just relax.

13:28.497 --> 13:31.099
Too much shit has happened
here, we can't let it go.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.134
I waited three years for
this house to be mine.

13:34.136 --> 13:36.271
Now I'm not letting some smug prick

13:36.273 --> 13:38.538
walk up in here and take it from me.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.675
No. What we need is a plan.

13:40.677 --> 13:42.377
Prostitutes. We'll become prostitutes,

13:42.379 --> 13:43.912
sell our bodies, make some money.

13:43.914 --> 13:45.312
We're definitely not doing a hunger strike.

13:45.314 --> 13:47.215
Oh, I'm having a brainstorm.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.117
We kill the dean!

13:50.953 --> 13:53.053
No.

13:53.055 --> 13:55.556
We kill the Dean's family and
make it look like he did it.

13:57.226 --> 13:59.027
- That's a great one.
- No, guys.

13:59.029 --> 14:01.528
We're not killing anybody, okay?

14:01.530 --> 14:03.096
What we need is some quick cash.

14:03.098 --> 14:04.465
Now let's think about this.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.633
Who would be dumb enough

14:06.635 --> 14:10.405
to spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars to buy this house?

14:13.643 --> 14:16.210
What the hell is this shit?

14:16.212 --> 14:18.312
Did I not tell this prick chef,

14:18.314 --> 14:20.080
medium-rare well?

14:20.082 --> 14:21.548
I heard you say it.
You definitely told him.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.450
And you call this bearnaise sauce?

14:23.452 --> 14:25.320
I'm appalled right now!

14:30.193 --> 14:32.060
Somebody tell that Chef

14:32.062 --> 14:34.262
I want a ham, with veal in
it, and crab legs sticking out.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.431
I'm paying $12,000 for it,

14:36.433 --> 14:41.002
so it better taste like $12,000!

14:41.004 --> 14:42.269
Hey, Thad.

14:42.271 --> 14:43.271
I was just won...

14:43.273 --> 14:45.406
Yep, there it is. Okay, hi.

14:45.408 --> 14:48.142
I'm Alex. What's your name? Seriously?

14:48.144 --> 14:49.009
He's clean.

14:49.011 --> 14:50.644
Hair.

14:50.646 --> 14:51.713
Clean.

14:51.715 --> 14:53.114
- Balls.
- What?

14:53.116 --> 14:55.516
Ah, what the...

14:55.518 --> 14:57.218
- Clean.
- Yeah.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.220
- I, uh, I just...
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!

14:59.222 --> 15:01.422
Whoa!

15:01.424 --> 15:02.757
Do you want me to put the...

15:02.759 --> 15:04.658
Put it on.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.127
Who is this guy?

15:06.129 --> 15:07.228
This is Dick Dawg.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.428
He's my security guy.

15:08.430 --> 15:10.163
And my cousin.

15:10.165 --> 15:11.999
And, um, like my butler sometimes.

15:12.001 --> 15:13.633
That's Dawg with a "W-G" motherfucker.

15:13.635 --> 15:15.103
- Ah.
- Suck my dick,

15:15.105 --> 15:16.537
you bowtie-wearing piece of shit!

15:16.539 --> 15:17.672
Oh!

15:17.674 --> 15:20.340
Oh!

15:20.342 --> 15:22.744
Oh, man. Nice work, Dick Dawg,

15:22.746 --> 15:24.378
- write yourself a check.
- Fuck yeah!

15:24.380 --> 15:26.480
You're wearing one too. You put this on me.

15:26.482 --> 15:29.182
Yeah and he'll do it
again, if I tell him to!

15:29.184 --> 15:31.319
I could dress you in bow ties for
the next thirty years if I want.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.519
Don't think I got the money?

15:32.521 --> 15:34.122
Read a newspaper.

15:34.124 --> 15:35.723
Don't got a subscription to a newspaper?

15:35.725 --> 15:36.824
I could buy you that too.

15:36.826 --> 15:39.793
Reading is fundamentional,
you giant bag of dicks.

15:42.564 --> 15:44.599
Amazing! Write yourself another check.

15:44.601 --> 15:45.667
All right.

15:45.669 --> 15:48.802
I'm starting to see the
family resemblance here.

15:48.804 --> 15:51.305
Sit down before I friggin lose my mind!

15:51.307 --> 15:55.209
Um, I guess, I'll just get to it then.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.244
Um...

15:56.246 --> 15:58.579
Um...

15:58.581 --> 16:00.715
Fucking say it.

16:00.717 --> 16:03.718
The Dean is selling the Goat House.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.187
And I was just thinking that
now that you're super rich,

16:07.189 --> 16:09.523
and famous that you could
maybe you could buy the house

16:09.525 --> 16:11.191
and give it to me.

16:11.193 --> 16:12.225
Hey, you wanna see something funny, Moran?

16:12.227 --> 16:14.228
Watch this.

16:14.230 --> 16:17.264
Whap, whap, whap, whap, whap,
whap, whap, whap, whap, whap,

16:17.266 --> 16:19.466
whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap...

16:19.468 --> 16:21.369
It's so fun, you have to try it Moran.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.237
- Do you know what, I'm good thanks.
- Whap, whap, whap.

16:23.239 --> 16:25.773
Fine. Suit yourself, God.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.374
So, the Goat House then? Hmm?

16:27.376 --> 16:28.843
Why would I buy the Goat House?

16:28.845 --> 16:30.610
Because it used to be yours.

16:30.612 --> 16:32.680
We had a lot of good times there, Thad!

16:32.682 --> 16:34.315
We can't let the Dean take it away.

16:34.317 --> 16:36.249
The past is the past, Moran.

16:36.251 --> 16:38.219
- I don't have time to think about BMS.
- Okay.

16:38.221 --> 16:39.686
I've got better things to do now.

16:39.688 --> 16:41.122
Bigger things.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.255
Huge things.

16:42.257 --> 16:43.324
Enormous things.

16:43.326 --> 16:44.524
Gigantic things.

16:44.526 --> 16:46.494
Infinity things.

16:46.496 --> 16:47.561
Uh... Why did I not think of that?

16:47.563 --> 16:49.162
Write me a check to myself.

16:49.164 --> 16:51.431
Please, Thad,

16:51.433 --> 16:53.635
you're my only hope.

16:55.871 --> 16:57.604
Okay,

16:57.606 --> 16:59.574
you really talked me into it, Moran.

16:59.576 --> 17:00.841
So, here's what I'm willing to do.

17:02.245 --> 17:03.710
Aw!

17:03.712 --> 17:06.445
I'm on a fucking roll right now.

17:07.851 --> 17:09.117
What the...

17:09.118 --> 17:10.184
You throw me this party?

17:10.185 --> 17:11.252
The fuck!

17:11.253 --> 17:14.186
And I'll help you out.

17:14.189 --> 17:16.589
Thadland?

17:16.592 --> 17:19.627
I came up with the idea when I was 10.

17:19.628 --> 17:21.795
I wished for a party that was...

17:21.797 --> 17:25.800
<i>Bigger than any party the
world had ever seen before.</i>

17:25.801 --> 17:30.504
<i>A party full of wonder,
and dreams, and titties!</i>

17:30.506 --> 17:34.708
<i>A place where I could celebrate
going pro and being a billionaire.</i>

17:34.710 --> 17:37.177
<i>And I called that place...</i>

17:37.179 --> 17:40.248
<i>"Thadland."</i>

17:42.518 --> 17:43.717
I only have $50,000,000 so far,

17:43.719 --> 17:44.886
but it'll have to do.

17:44.888 --> 17:46.521
Okay.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.223
Why can't you just throw
this party yourself?

17:49.225 --> 17:50.358
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.425
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah

17:51.427 --> 17:52.526
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:52.528 --> 17:53.660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:53.662 --> 17:55.562
Because that would be tacky.

17:55.564 --> 17:56.664
Here's your veal.

17:56.666 --> 17:59.332
- Stuffed ham with crab legs.
- Whoa!

17:59.334 --> 18:01.502
Look, I, I...

18:01.504 --> 18:03.603
I just don't think that
this is gonna be possible.

18:03.605 --> 18:04.906
Well, that's my offer.

18:04.908 --> 18:06.374
Do it and I'll help you out.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.841
Don't do it,

18:07.843 --> 18:09.276
and I won't.

18:09.278 --> 18:11.478
Now get out!

18:11.480 --> 18:14.648
I never want to see your handsome
face in here again. Get out!

18:14.650 --> 18:17.451
And where the hell are my meatballs?

18:17.453 --> 18:19.689
This is insane!

18:21.757 --> 18:25.292
I mean, it's doable but
it's all pretty screwed up.

18:25.294 --> 18:27.695
- Is, is that a unicorn shitting a rainbow?
- Yeah.

18:27.697 --> 18:29.397
That's not a horn coming out of its head,

18:29.399 --> 18:30.564
that's a dildo.

18:31.734 --> 18:33.900
So it's a dildocorn.

18:33.902 --> 18:35.302
But yes, it is shitting a rainbow.

18:35.304 --> 18:36.803
Okay, guys look,

18:36.805 --> 18:38.738
I have been thinking a lot about this.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.808
Throwing this party is
not going to be that bad.

18:40.810 --> 18:43.578
Thad and I were really started hitting
it off before he left school last year.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.312
I'm in. I'm doing this.

18:45.314 --> 18:46.480
Nice.

18:46.482 --> 18:48.749
Screw it. I'm in too.

18:48.751 --> 18:51.651
Gentlemen, before we
get ahead of ourselves,

18:51.653 --> 18:55.990
I'd like to remind you, all the man
we'd be inviting back into this house.

18:55.992 --> 19:00.561
You are the very same man who viscously
burned down a field of my weed,

19:00.563 --> 19:02.830
just so he could get God high.

19:02.832 --> 19:05.499
I understand where you're
coming from, Harmon.

19:05.501 --> 19:06.900
Trust me,

19:06.902 --> 19:11.371
there is no other way
to save the Goat House.

19:11.373 --> 19:12.540
All right,

19:12.542 --> 19:14.341
- you are the king.
- Huh?

19:14.343 --> 19:15.609
- So you're in?
- I'm in!

19:15.611 --> 19:17.344
- Yes!
- So, we're doing this.

19:17.346 --> 19:18.213
- All right, we are.
- All right.

19:18.215 --> 19:20.947
Bring it in. Thadland on three, baby.

19:20.949 --> 19:22.015
Let's go, baby.

19:22.017 --> 19:23.451
One, two, three.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.454
Thadland!

19:31.995 --> 19:35.029
You guys have any clue what the hell
is going on, on this last page here?

19:35.031 --> 19:36.664
You think he wants to fly?

19:36.666 --> 19:38.599
- No. It's a metaphor.
- Yeah.

19:38.601 --> 19:39.899
He wants to get so high

19:39.901 --> 19:41.369
it feels like he's flying.

19:41.371 --> 19:43.603
No. He's a plane.

19:43.605 --> 19:46.374
I had a dream the other
night that I was a plane,

19:46.376 --> 19:48.576
and I crashed and burned.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.311
But then I woke up and I realized

19:51.313 --> 19:56.449
that my bed was just on fire because
I fell asleep with a lit cigarette.

19:56.451 --> 19:57.917
Um, I'm sorry.

19:57.919 --> 19:59.986
Where did you come from?

19:59.988 --> 20:01.621
Heaven.

20:01.623 --> 20:03.823
Oh, this is your friend!

20:03.825 --> 20:05.859
Right, well, welcome to the Goat House!

20:05.861 --> 20:07.661
It's magical.

20:07.663 --> 20:09.863
Yeah. I can feel it.

20:09.865 --> 20:11.799
Like, the magic.

20:11.801 --> 20:13.333
Right.

20:13.335 --> 20:15.602
And I like the magic here too.

20:15.604 --> 20:16.771
Yeah, they just cut the grass.

20:16.773 --> 20:18.039
Oh.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.308
Uh, so... We're...

20:20.310 --> 20:22.042
We're throwing a party this weekend.

20:22.044 --> 20:23.444
You should come.

20:23.446 --> 20:24.645
I'll be there.

20:24.647 --> 20:27.348
Oh, good.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.349
Yeah, we'll be there.

20:29.351 --> 20:30.784
Skin it.

20:31.853 --> 20:33.053
Okay.

20:33.055 --> 20:36.958
All right. Oh! Ha!

20:48.103 --> 20:49.969
Yeah, it's me.

20:49.971 --> 20:51.738
Sammy, how do I look?

20:51.740 --> 20:53.707
- Wow, I love that suit.
- Yeah?

20:53.709 --> 20:55.475
It looks just like the one Thad drew.

20:55.477 --> 20:57.778
Hey, if he drew it, we're
gonna make it happen.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.946
I don't want to give him any
reason not to buy us this house.

20:59.948 --> 21:01.648
All right?

21:01.650 --> 21:03.751
Guys, I'm beginning to
think Thad's not coming.

21:03.753 --> 21:05.653
Oh, he's coming.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.723
I know it.

21:08.791 --> 21:09.956
What the hell is that sound?

21:09.958 --> 21:12.361
Is that a...

21:16.498 --> 21:18.099
Is that a fucking hovercraft?

21:18.101 --> 21:20.969
He's here! He's here!

21:34.816 --> 21:38.785
Hey, Thad.

21:38.787 --> 21:41.722
You're hand's on a $30,000
coat right now, Moran.

21:41.724 --> 21:43.993
Hey, cool suit, ass wipe.

21:45.128 --> 21:46.093
Hilarious.

21:46.095 --> 21:48.963
You're the one who told
me wear... Never mind.

21:48.965 --> 21:50.430
You remember the guys right?

21:50.432 --> 21:53.032
- Donnie.
- Hey, buddy.

21:53.034 --> 21:54.834
Oh, Thad.

21:54.836 --> 21:57.670
It's so great to see you,
thanks for coming by here!

21:57.672 --> 21:59.639
Who are you?

21:59.641 --> 22:01.074
Sammy!

22:01.076 --> 22:03.977
You know you used to call
me Mascot, or houseboy!

22:03.979 --> 22:06.647
I wore the goat suit! I'd go,
"Go team, go." I was out there.

22:06.649 --> 22:08.448
There was someone in that thing?

22:08.450 --> 22:10.917
Hey, back off.

22:10.919 --> 22:12.119
Oh, no, it's okay I'm
just talking to my friend.

22:12.121 --> 22:13.587
Oh, your friend?

22:13.589 --> 22:14.855
I don't think he knows you man.

22:14.857 --> 22:16.557
Well...

22:16.559 --> 22:17.625
I don't know you.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.459
- I've never met you.
- I have.

22:19.461 --> 22:20.160
I just don't remember you.

22:20.162 --> 22:21.962
I don't think so.

22:21.964 --> 22:22.795
I have met you, your
face isn't ringing a bell.

22:22.797 --> 22:24.197
I've never met you in my life bro.

22:24.199 --> 22:26.000
Okay. Thad.

22:26.002 --> 22:27.967
Are you ready?

22:27.969 --> 22:29.536
I drew this thing when I was 10.

22:29.538 --> 22:33.474
I've been waiting for...

22:33.476 --> 22:35.542
Thirteen. Thirteen years.

22:35.544 --> 22:36.976
I was gonna say that.

22:36.978 --> 22:40.513
All right then, let's
just step right up here.

22:40.515 --> 22:42.882
Welcome

22:42.884 --> 22:45.586
to Thadland.

22:53.228 --> 22:55.430
I...

23:19.688 --> 23:21.522
Fifty-four strains of marijuana?

23:21.524 --> 23:25.026
Yep. And all the most
expensive in the world.

23:36.171 --> 23:37.871
Cocaine!

23:37.873 --> 23:39.673
United Nations of cocaine.

23:39.675 --> 23:41.809
Purest strains from around the world.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.644
Tested each one personally.

23:43.646 --> 23:45.279
Just one rule about the cocaine room.

23:45.281 --> 23:49.015
Guys, don't die.

23:49.017 --> 23:51.118
Or do, who gives a shit. More coke for me!

23:51.120 --> 23:52.719
Boobie bomb!

23:52.721 --> 23:54.956
Oh!

24:01.730 --> 24:04.467
Yeah, baby!

24:15.777 --> 24:17.176
Booze room.

24:17.178 --> 24:18.745
Every kind of booze ever?

24:18.747 --> 24:20.813
Yep, just pull a tap.

24:20.815 --> 24:22.750
Woo!

24:22.752 --> 24:25.886
My ass is getting pounded tonight!

24:25.888 --> 24:27.721
Hammered. Your ass is getting hammered.

24:27.723 --> 24:29.924
Tomato, potato, bro beans.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.559
Is the champagne from France?

24:31.561 --> 24:33.293
Nope. California.

24:33.295 --> 24:36.597
Good. Everything good comes from America.

24:36.599 --> 24:39.132
France can suck my balls!

24:47.043 --> 24:48.676
And here we have...

24:48.678 --> 24:50.779
Mojito hot tub!

24:58.053 --> 24:59.854
Well?

25:00.922 --> 25:03.057
It's perfect, Moran!

25:03.059 --> 25:04.291
Horny? Grab a sloot!

25:04.293 --> 25:06.292
Thirsty? Grab a mojito!

25:06.294 --> 25:09.031
I'm, I'm good thanks.

25:14.769 --> 25:16.203
You haven't even seen the best part yet!

25:16.205 --> 25:17.870
I wanna see.

25:17.872 --> 25:18.906
- Do you wanna see the best part?
- Yeah.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.976
Let's go see the best part.

25:41.263 --> 25:43.796
I can't believe I drew this.

25:43.798 --> 25:46.099
I'm a frigging genius!

25:46.101 --> 25:50.103
And your most genius invention
is coming, my humble friend.

25:51.873 --> 25:52.973
In Thadland,

25:52.975 --> 25:56.312
it always snows cocaine.

26:16.064 --> 26:18.965
So? Thad?

26:18.967 --> 26:21.201
What do you have to say?

26:21.203 --> 26:23.606
What do I have to say?

26:27.043 --> 26:28.809
Fuck you Walt Disney,

26:28.811 --> 26:31.244
you unimaginative piece of shit!

26:31.246 --> 26:34.982
This is Thadland!

28:44.412 --> 28:46.079
Hey, Thad, going to a butcher,

28:46.081 --> 28:47.380
ask your friends for opinions.

28:47.382 --> 28:50.017
Like which of those sloots I'd bang?

29:24.553 --> 29:26.522
That's it guys, get him
the hell out of here.

29:35.163 --> 29:36.597
<i>Goat fans have spoken.</i>

29:36.599 --> 29:40.202
<i>They want Marty Daniels
out. And in other news...</i>

29:43.104 --> 29:44.571
Forget them.

29:44.573 --> 29:46.372
You guys are gonna be fine this year.

29:46.374 --> 29:48.942
Plus, you're not that old.

29:48.944 --> 29:52.247
I lost my virginity the day Kennedy died.

29:55.450 --> 29:56.550
One more, please.

29:56.552 --> 29:58.886
Coming right up.

29:58.888 --> 30:00.620
I think you're amazing.

30:00.622 --> 30:03.023
I mean, with everything
that you've been through,

30:03.025 --> 30:04.558
the lawsuits,

30:04.560 --> 30:07.961
and losing Thad Castle and
Craig Shilo and Radon Randell

30:07.963 --> 30:09.529
and still winning.

30:09.531 --> 30:10.964
We should be building your statue,

30:10.966 --> 30:13.534
not bitching about your age.

30:15.371 --> 30:18.407
Would you like to take
a ride on my motorcycle?

30:27.082 --> 30:28.581
Ahhh. Mmm.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.384
Mmm.

30:51.306 --> 30:53.608
Oh, fuck me!

31:08.023 --> 31:09.222
Alex!

31:09.224 --> 31:11.291
Hey! What's up?

31:11.293 --> 31:13.961
- Alex, so good to see you.
- You too.

31:13.963 --> 31:16.163
This party is bonkers!

31:16.165 --> 31:18.732
I just did a half hour in
the bath-salt bubble room.

31:18.734 --> 31:20.734
I bit like seven people!

31:20.736 --> 31:22.535
Working it!

31:22.537 --> 31:24.737
Congrats! Hey, come with me,

31:24.739 --> 31:25.606
I wanna show you around!

31:25.608 --> 31:28.007
Okay. Oh, I wanna show you my nipples.

31:28.009 --> 31:29.176
Oh, okay.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.246
Coming.

31:49.163 --> 31:50.230
Locked and loaded, Sir.

31:50.232 --> 31:53.199
Oh, sweet.

31:53.201 --> 31:54.568
Hey, everybody!

31:54.570 --> 31:55.635
Open your mouths!

31:55.637 --> 31:58.170
Free drugs!

31:58.172 --> 32:02.208
Ahhh! My face! Oh, God damn it. My face!

32:02.210 --> 32:03.342
That's why we have medics!

32:03.344 --> 32:04.444
Go see a medic!

32:04.446 --> 32:05.678
Help.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.481
Cocaine!

32:12.053 --> 32:14.454
Hey, welcome back.

32:14.456 --> 32:16.156
Coach?

32:18.293 --> 32:20.659
I just wanted to stop by and
congratulate you on everything.

32:20.661 --> 32:22.228
And we're really proud of you.

32:22.230 --> 32:24.398
Oh, yeah!

32:24.400 --> 32:25.465
What happened to you?

32:25.467 --> 32:27.434
Oh, I hit a pothole.

32:27.436 --> 32:29.101
I was riding my motorcycle.

32:29.103 --> 32:31.038
And, everything's fine, I'm
okay, everything's great.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.372
Yeah! Yeah! Me too!

32:33.374 --> 32:35.476
Never been better!

32:37.713 --> 32:39.713
We should hangout sometime.

32:39.715 --> 32:41.548
Definitely. We definitely gotta do that.

32:41.550 --> 32:43.485
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

32:46.321 --> 32:47.387
- Don't go. Don't go.
- I miss you.

32:47.389 --> 32:48.487
- What?
- Huh?

32:48.489 --> 32:50.256
Oh, no. I thought I...

32:50.258 --> 32:51.457
- No. No. No. No. Hey uh...
- Oh, wait...

32:51.459 --> 32:52.158
I... No, I thought you were
gonna say something else.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.761
No, no, no. Hey, have fun.

32:54.763 --> 32:56.062
Take care of yourself.

32:56.064 --> 32:57.464
Oh, yeah, yeah.

32:57.466 --> 32:59.265
Keep training, you look good.

32:59.267 --> 33:01.201
Oh, yeah. You look great too, coach.

33:01.203 --> 33:03.637
Very handsome.

33:03.639 --> 33:05.605
Hey, Thad. Hey, man. Hey, uh...

33:05.607 --> 33:07.573
Thad, Thad, Thad, Thad, Thad, Thad, Thad,

33:07.575 --> 33:07.907
we've got, we've got
bit of a situation, dude.

33:07.909 --> 33:11.078
Hit me!

33:11.080 --> 33:12.178
What the hell was that?

33:12.180 --> 33:13.280
You said, "Hit me."

33:13.282 --> 33:15.282
- What the... What?
- I'm sorry.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.117
Okay, look, I don't know
what was going on here,

33:17.119 --> 33:18.017
but we're running out of drugs.

33:18.019 --> 33:20.219
The party's running out of drugs, man.

33:20.221 --> 33:21.455
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know. I don't know.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.557
Free drugs!

33:23.559 --> 33:25.292
It makes no sense to me, man.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.859
Because thousands of people are here, okay?

33:26.861 --> 33:27.628
I mean, half the cocaine was
reserved for the carnivals.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.196
But, I mean, that was reserved.

33:29.198 --> 33:30.296
It's called the reserve for a reason.

33:30.298 --> 33:31.798
We need that for the carnival snow.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.365
Sorry, I'm talking so fast.
I'm just really freaking out,

33:32.367 --> 33:34.301
we need that cocaine.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.403
Well, go get Alex to get
more drugs and fix it! God!

33:36.405 --> 33:39.473
Hey, I already bought all the
drugs east of the Mississippi,

33:39.475 --> 33:41.808
there's no more drugs to buy.

33:41.810 --> 33:43.109
That's not true.

33:43.111 --> 33:45.344
- We've got drugs.
- Who are you?

33:45.346 --> 33:47.414
What? I'm...

33:47.416 --> 33:48.715
I'm the...

33:48.717 --> 33:49.782
I...

33:49.784 --> 33:51.283
You know what? It doesn't matter.

33:51.285 --> 33:54.753
Doesn't matter. What
maters is, you need drugs,

33:54.755 --> 33:56.490
Harmon and I have some.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.224
Real premium shit too.

33:58.226 --> 33:59.559
- Amazing.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

33:59.561 --> 34:01.427
I don't think that's a good idea.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:03.131 --> 34:04.563
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:04.565 --> 34:06.233
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:06.235 --> 34:07.001
No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:07.003 --> 34:07.801
You idiots go get free drugs,

34:07.803 --> 34:09.835
you'll be my best friends for life.

34:09.838 --> 34:12.237
- Well sorry, I can't.
- No, no, no. You know what? Done!

34:12.239 --> 34:13.672
- Consider it done. Yeah, yeah we got this.
- No, I'm not.

34:13.675 --> 34:15.306
Thank you so much, we'll get this buddy.

34:15.309 --> 34:16.542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I trust this guy.

34:16.543 --> 34:18.445
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too, me too, me too.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.246
I told you it's a bad idea, man.

34:21.248 --> 34:23.382
How much more of this shit
do we have to put up with?

34:23.385 --> 34:24.617
What shit?

34:24.619 --> 34:27.521
The titty-whapping, the groping.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.688
I mean, sure, it's paying for my doctorate

34:29.690 --> 34:32.358
in applied physics, but I don't
know if I can keep doing this.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.428
You're in this for the money?

34:35.429 --> 34:38.400
You gold digging bitch!

34:39.501 --> 34:41.501
I love Thad.

34:41.503 --> 34:44.106
I love him!

34:47.507 --> 34:50.577
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.

34:50.579 --> 34:52.678
Why not silly bear? It's free booze.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.614
I can think of a reason.

34:56.617 --> 35:00.253
- Whoops!
- Whoa, there it is! I know.

35:00.255 --> 35:01.954
- Whoa, there it is!
- I've got your wiener.

35:01.956 --> 35:04.524
- I know.
- Alex! Hi.

35:04.526 --> 35:06.926
Hi. I just saw a woman deep throat a 40.

35:06.928 --> 35:11.830
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm, a full 40. You should go find her.

35:11.832 --> 35:16.369
I am going to go find her and Sammy.

35:16.371 --> 35:17.570
Have you seen Sammy?

35:17.572 --> 35:19.405
No, he's not in the tub.

35:19.407 --> 35:21.941
This is true. I'm gonna go find Sammy.

35:21.943 --> 35:23.943
Bye. Bye.

35:23.945 --> 35:26.680
- Don't touch that.
- Why not?

35:29.418 --> 35:32.586
Oh, this is awesome! How long
has this been down here for?

35:32.588 --> 35:34.387
Built it my freshman year.

35:34.389 --> 35:37.823
It's nothing compared to my
cousin Dennis' set up back home.

35:37.825 --> 35:39.559
Holy shit, what is this,
like steel or something?

35:39.561 --> 35:40.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't touch that.

35:40.829 --> 35:43.796
Don't breath on it, don't even look at it.

35:43.798 --> 35:45.365
My cousin Dennis blew up his trailer

35:45.367 --> 35:47.666
just by sneezing on a tank.

35:47.668 --> 35:50.937
Oh, man, that means it
must be powerful. Yes!

35:50.939 --> 35:52.872
Thad is gonna love this then
he's gonna remember my name!

35:52.874 --> 35:54.474
Oh, yes!

35:54.476 --> 35:57.309
Hey look at me. This
isn't a typical drug, okay.

35:57.311 --> 35:59.278
It's highly unstable.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.247
Yeah, well, I'm highly
unstable too, my friend.

36:01.249 --> 36:02.881
That's why I brought Billy.

36:02.883 --> 36:05.452
I figure, you know,

36:05.454 --> 36:06.620
test it on him first,

36:06.622 --> 36:08.523
see if he can handle it.

36:09.925 --> 36:11.758
Animal testing, Sammy?

36:11.760 --> 36:13.459
Once again, not a good idea.

36:13.461 --> 36:15.629
You know what? It's fine.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.030
Billy's a little fucking asshole.

36:17.032 --> 36:18.865
So whatever happens to him, happens to him.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.340
Oh, yeah. Look at his eyes.

36:27.342 --> 36:29.408
Oh, he's loving this.

36:29.410 --> 36:30.843
You like that, Billy?

36:30.845 --> 36:33.546
Huh? "Oh, no. I can't handle my drugs."

36:33.548 --> 36:36.283
"I can't handle my drugs."

36:39.720 --> 36:43.525
There you go. Get your balloons here!

36:44.660 --> 36:45.725
Hey, man, I really think we should have

36:45.727 --> 36:47.394
gone with a lower dose.

36:47.396 --> 36:49.729
Dude, relax, okay? Billy's fine.

36:49.731 --> 36:53.432
We're all good. Oh, shit, there's Thad.

36:53.434 --> 36:55.401
Thad, Thad, Thad, Thad. Listen.

36:55.403 --> 36:57.771
Uh, here's the drug I
was telling you about.

36:57.773 --> 36:58.838
- This?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.506
Just suck on it, you'll love it.

37:00.508 --> 37:01.441
This better be good.

37:01.443 --> 37:03.445
Oh, it will be.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.588
I'll devour your soul!

37:22.097 --> 37:23.662
It's perfect.

37:23.664 --> 37:24.898
Dick Dawg, write this guy a check.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.599
Oh. No, no, no need for payment.

37:26.601 --> 37:28.501
I, uh... All I need from you is, uh...

37:28.503 --> 37:29.635
Fiendship. Just, you know,

37:29.637 --> 37:31.672
remember what my name and stuff.

37:33.108 --> 37:35.742
How about a hot sloot instead?

37:35.744 --> 37:37.910
Well, that'll work. Yeah. It's good.

37:37.912 --> 37:39.845
Tina!

37:39.847 --> 37:41.780
Tina. Hey.

37:41.782 --> 37:44.818
Tina, this is...

37:44.820 --> 37:45.885
Sammy.

37:45.887 --> 37:47.954
And, uh...

37:47.956 --> 37:50.023
- Sammy.
- This is Tina.

37:50.025 --> 37:53.827
Uh, Tina, would you mind showing, uh...

37:54.863 --> 37:56.463
Sammy.

37:56.465 --> 37:57.564
Upstairs and showing him a good time?

37:57.566 --> 37:58.532
Okay.

37:58.534 --> 38:00.966
- Thank you so much. Thank you. Ahhh!
- Let's go!

38:00.968 --> 38:02.836
Ahhh! Thank you so much, Thad!

38:02.838 --> 38:05.974
- I really appreciate.
- Thank you, Tina! You're the best!

38:09.945 --> 38:12.745
Oh, lets go look at the pretty white pony

38:12.747 --> 38:15.481
with the golden horn.

38:15.483 --> 38:17.550
Let's do that, huh?

38:17.552 --> 38:21.153
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

38:21.155 --> 38:23.990
Hey, don't worry about her,
okay? It's just a thing.

38:23.992 --> 38:26.760
Just a thing? I invited her tonight

38:26.762 --> 38:29.062
to specifically turn her into a dyke.

38:29.064 --> 38:30.296
And he can't keep his hands off her.

38:30.298 --> 38:34.600
Dude, come on. You're not
mad at him, you're mad at her.

38:34.602 --> 38:36.870
She's taking Alex away from you.

38:36.872 --> 38:40.039
This so reminds me of my dad.

38:40.041 --> 38:41.408
Um.

38:41.410 --> 38:42.809
He loved horses.

38:42.811 --> 38:44.144
Oh, okay.

38:44.146 --> 38:45.644
I don't know what you think is going on

38:45.646 --> 38:48.715
between me and Alex, but I like pussy.

38:48.717 --> 38:51.084
No, no. I love pussy.

38:51.086 --> 38:54.620
Yeah, I love pussy!

38:54.622 --> 38:56.523
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo!

38:56.525 --> 38:57.791
Yeah, but before that you didn't.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.158
And you were into Alex.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.559
And you know what,

39:00.561 --> 39:02.061
I don't think you're gay.

39:02.063 --> 39:03.162
You're college gay.

39:03.164 --> 39:04.963
Which is totally different.

39:04.965 --> 39:06.499
You're just killing time with women.

39:06.501 --> 39:09.202
Okay, now I am offended. Yeah.

39:09.204 --> 39:10.937
You are offending me right now.

39:10.939 --> 39:14.541
What makes you think you know
the first thing about my gayness?

39:14.543 --> 39:17.042
Well. I'm gay.

39:17.044 --> 39:18.678
What?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.580
- Since when?
- Since forever.

39:21.582 --> 39:22.981
I just never say anything about it

39:22.983 --> 39:24.883
because no one ever asks. But yeah...

39:24.885 --> 39:26.688
I'm gay.

39:28.789 --> 39:31.191
- No way.
- Awesome.

39:31.193 --> 39:34.093
Thad. Thad, it's not a big deal, okay?

39:34.095 --> 39:36.195
It's a personal thing
and I'd really appreciate

39:36.197 --> 39:37.564
if we could keep it that way.

39:37.566 --> 39:41.501
Donnie, absolutely.

39:41.503 --> 39:43.635
- Totally agree.
- Thank you.

39:43.637 --> 39:45.171
<i>Hey, Everybody!</i>

39:45.173 --> 39:46.840
<i>Donnie's gay!</i>

39:49.778 --> 39:52.812
Hey. Seriously, man. Congratulations, dude.

39:52.814 --> 39:55.481
You're gonna get so much dick.

39:55.483 --> 39:57.149
<i>Hey, Harmon. Donnie's a gay guy!</i>

39:57.151 --> 39:59.586
I know that.

39:59.588 --> 40:02.921
Again, Thad, it's never been a big deal.

40:02.923 --> 40:04.256
Let's keep it that way. Okay?

40:04.258 --> 40:06.559
How's this for not a big deal?

40:06.561 --> 40:08.495
I'm gonna buy you a car, you brave bastard.

40:08.497 --> 40:10.162
Dick Dawg, write this gay guy a check!

40:10.164 --> 40:12.199
Fuck yeah!

40:14.168 --> 40:16.035
It's for the whole gay thing, man.

40:16.037 --> 40:17.704
Congrats.

40:17.706 --> 40:20.573
I'm gonna shove so many things up your ass.

40:20.575 --> 40:22.008
Let me put it to you this way,

40:22.010 --> 40:24.711
you can drive a fucking Cadillac up there,

40:24.713 --> 40:27.713
just as long as I get to
have sex with you after.

40:27.715 --> 40:29.215
Wow. Um...

40:29.217 --> 40:31.149
There's the pool stick
downstairs, I could try it.

40:31.151 --> 40:33.086
Uh, yeah. That sounds great.

40:33.088 --> 40:34.387
Why don't you give me
another hit and then run that

40:34.389 --> 40:36.523
cute little butt of yours
downstairs and grab it. Okay?

40:36.525 --> 40:38.559
Okay.

40:41.530 --> 40:43.598
Mmm.

40:44.798 --> 40:46.832
I'll be right back.

40:46.834 --> 40:50.135
Oh, yes. Go!

40:50.137 --> 40:52.805
Tina, I love you.

40:52.807 --> 40:55.173
Sammy, we're gonna need more balloons.

40:55.175 --> 40:58.912
You're right, people are going nuts for...

41:10.892 --> 41:12.694
Billy!

41:21.102 --> 41:24.506
Oh, shit!

41:25.673 --> 41:29.076
Oh, shit!

41:33.314 --> 41:36.282
Thad, thank you so much
for this opportunity.

41:36.284 --> 41:37.649
Leave the lot to me.

41:37.651 --> 41:38.718
Thank you so much.

41:39.787 --> 41:40.986
Tina!

41:40.988 --> 41:42.789
Tina, is that you?

41:49.965 --> 41:51.597
Okay, well, I hear walking,

41:51.599 --> 41:52.798
I wanna hear some running, okay?

41:52.800 --> 41:54.601
Get over here, Tina.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.240
Whoa.

42:01.242 --> 42:02.841
Uh, all right.

42:02.843 --> 42:04.910
All right.

42:04.912 --> 42:07.245
Oh! Wow! Wow!

42:07.247 --> 42:09.048
That felt very nice.

42:09.050 --> 42:11.184
You are a dirty girl, Tina. Dirty girl.

42:16.256 --> 42:18.124
Oh, go easy...

42:18.126 --> 42:20.026
Go easy...

42:20.028 --> 42:21.093
Easy...

42:21.095 --> 42:22.294
Nice and slow.

42:22.296 --> 42:25.198
All right, finish it up so I
can have sex with you, okay?

42:25.200 --> 42:27.733
Sammy! I'm ready if you are!

42:29.137 --> 42:30.303
Tina!

42:32.340 --> 42:34.707
Billy! Bad Billy!

42:34.709 --> 42:36.175
That's a bad goat.

42:36.177 --> 42:38.044
Bad goat, Billy!

42:38.046 --> 42:40.979
Bad goat, Billy! Bad goat!

42:49.323 --> 42:50.557
<i>Hey, everybody! Listen up.</i>

42:50.559 --> 42:52.791
<i>I have a very important
announcement to make.</i>

42:55.095 --> 42:56.928
<i>Donnie Schrab is gay!</i>

43:00.001 --> 43:01.667
Not a big deal everybody.

43:01.669 --> 43:02.602
<i>So you know,</i>

43:02.604 --> 43:04.671
<i>I don't know, buy him a drink...</i>

43:04.673 --> 43:07.073
<i>Or if you're a guy, suck
his dick or whatever.</i>

43:07.075 --> 43:08.140
<i>But it's great.</i>

43:08.142 --> 43:09.977
<i>Let's party!</i>

43:12.079 --> 43:14.847
Hey, are you feeling a little
overshadowed by all this?

43:14.849 --> 43:16.349
I mean, a cheerleader comes out as gay

43:16.351 --> 43:17.816
and no one bats an eye.

43:17.818 --> 43:18.450
But when a football player does,

43:18.452 --> 43:20.787
suddenly he's the hero?

43:22.157 --> 43:25.358
Mary Jo, wait!

43:25.360 --> 43:26.959
Do you have any blueberry waffles

43:26.961 --> 43:30.098
because I'm super-duper
starving right now.

43:31.265 --> 43:33.066
Is that a yes?

43:33.068 --> 43:34.733
Mary Jo! Ah...

43:36.738 --> 43:39.140
Oh, shit. The auction!

43:40.240 --> 43:42.140
Where did he...

43:42.142 --> 43:43.276
- Thad!
- Billy!

43:43.278 --> 43:45.311
Billy!

43:45.313 --> 43:47.245
Oh, hey, Sammy, Sammy.

43:47.247 --> 43:49.282
- Have you seen Billy?
- Nope. I have not seen Billy.

43:49.284 --> 43:51.416
And those balloons, not good.

43:51.418 --> 43:53.151
Yeah I told you that. You okay?

43:53.153 --> 43:54.486
Me? Totally fine.

43:54.488 --> 43:55.821
Never been better, never been better.

43:55.823 --> 43:58.358
There we go. Oh, there we go.

44:08.001 --> 44:11.037
Officer. We're going
to shut this party down.

44:11.039 --> 44:12.338
I'm sorry, Dean, mate. I can't let you in.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.907
Thad Castle and Alex Moran
made a very significant donation

44:14.909 --> 44:16.508
to our benevolent fund.

44:16.510 --> 44:18.910
They specifically asked that
we not let you into the house.

44:18.912 --> 44:21.213
Fine! They want to play like that?

44:21.215 --> 44:22.381
We sell this house

44:22.383 --> 44:24.850
right here, right now!

44:24.852 --> 44:29.088
Auctioneer, bidders, right now.

44:29.090 --> 44:31.990
Thad!

44:31.992 --> 44:34.260
Thad!

44:34.262 --> 44:37.129
Thad!

44:38.767 --> 44:40.432
Round and round he goes!

44:40.434 --> 44:44.903
Where he stops nobody knows!

44:44.905 --> 44:46.972
Okay, Barbara, you have
to take a Jell-O shot

44:46.974 --> 44:49.108
and make out with Jeanine for five seconds.

44:49.110 --> 44:50.876
Okay.

44:50.878 --> 44:52.477
Oh, my god!

44:52.479 --> 44:55.782
- Oh, my God!
- Thad!

44:55.784 --> 44:57.383
Okay. Thad, it's midnight, okay?

44:57.385 --> 44:58.483
The auction is happening right now.

44:58.485 --> 45:00.153
- We need to go.
- Uh...

45:00.155 --> 45:01.787
We're playing spin the Thad-dle,

45:01.789 --> 45:03.488
- page twenty-one of the book.
- I know what it is!

45:03.490 --> 45:04.923
I'm the one who set it up for you,

45:04.925 --> 45:06.258
- like I said I would.
- Okay, great!

45:06.260 --> 45:08.294
So you know how important this is to me.

45:08.296 --> 45:10.428
Spin me!

45:10.430 --> 45:13.566
Yay!

45:13.568 --> 45:15.501
Thad, saving the Goat House

45:15.503 --> 45:17.236
- is the whole reason I agreed to throw this party
- Oh, my gosh!

45:17.238 --> 45:18.937
- in the first place.
- I can't take this anymore.

45:18.939 --> 45:20.439
We don't have time for this, Moran!

45:20.441 --> 45:23.408
Debbie, do a line of coke
off Nancy's knockers and...

45:23.410 --> 45:25.111
- Spin me!
- No, no, no.

45:25.113 --> 45:26.579
Don't spin, don't spin.

45:26.581 --> 45:28.948
Yay!

45:28.950 --> 45:33.119
Never stop spinning me!

45:33.121 --> 45:34.452
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.

45:34.454 --> 45:35.521
We're putting up for auction

45:35.523 --> 45:37.088
this piece of real estate.

45:37.090 --> 45:40.425
We'll start the bidding at $150,000.

45:40.427 --> 45:42.294
Do I hear $150,000?

45:42.296 --> 45:45.564
One-fifty right here.
Looking for 175, 175.

45:45.566 --> 45:48.267
Do I hear 200? Do I hear two?

45:48.269 --> 45:49.936
$200,000.

45:51.238 --> 45:53.305
Your reign here is over, Mr. Moran.

45:53.307 --> 45:55.106
It's best to step away gracefully.

45:55.108 --> 45:57.475
We have 240 right here. Looking for 250.

45:57.477 --> 45:59.111
240,000 going once...

45:59.113 --> 46:00.412
Shit!

46:00.414 --> 46:03.115
240,000 going twice...

46:03.117 --> 46:05.952
Three million!

46:05.954 --> 46:09.120
Son, the current bid is $240,000.

46:09.122 --> 46:11.057
Oh...

46:11.059 --> 46:14.961
Maybe you should make it three
and a half million dollars.

46:14.963 --> 46:18.030
Okay, $3.5 million going once...

46:18.032 --> 46:19.231
Four million dollars!

46:19.233 --> 46:21.600
Thad, you don't have to outbid yourself.

46:21.602 --> 46:24.070
- Five million dollars!
- Oh, my God.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.571
Fine, $5,000,000 going once,

46:26.573 --> 46:29.508
$5,000,000 going twice.

46:29.510 --> 46:32.979
Oh, yeah! Yeah, nice try.

46:32.981 --> 46:35.280
I'd have to be a real idiot
to pay more than $5,000,000

46:35.282 --> 46:37.550
for this piece of shit house.

46:37.552 --> 46:40.119
Sold for $5,000,000.

46:40.121 --> 46:42.954
To the oiled up man in
the white, furry slippers.

46:42.956 --> 46:44.624
- Woo-hoo!
- They cannot do that!

46:44.626 --> 46:46.892
- They can't do this.
- He bid for it fair and square.

46:46.894 --> 46:49.028
Oh, sorry, Deany.

46:49.030 --> 46:51.664
This castle is very well protected.

46:51.666 --> 46:55.468
Officer, would you escort the
Dean off of my property, please.

46:55.470 --> 46:56.669
You don't know who you're
messing with, Moran.

46:56.671 --> 46:58.470
- All right, let's go.
- I will bring the thunder!

46:58.472 --> 46:59.671
And you, Daniels!

46:59.673 --> 47:02.541
Daniels! I come for you next!

47:02.543 --> 47:04.142
I know what really happened.

47:06.180 --> 47:08.079
You're a drunk!

47:08.081 --> 47:11.383
All right. Everybody back inside.

47:11.385 --> 47:13.486
Let's party!

47:13.488 --> 47:15.254
Oh, my God!

47:15.256 --> 47:17.055
I did it!

47:17.057 --> 47:21.094
Oh! I finally got my Goat House back!

47:22.329 --> 47:23.495
What did you just say?

47:23.497 --> 47:24.664
Hmm?

47:24.666 --> 47:26.131
Oh, thank you.

47:26.133 --> 47:28.367
You really helped me out here, man.

47:28.369 --> 47:30.169
I got my Goat House back.

47:30.171 --> 47:31.637
Your house?

47:31.639 --> 47:34.039
Yeah.

47:34.041 --> 47:36.508
God...

47:36.510 --> 47:38.510
This has never been about me, has it?

47:38.512 --> 47:41.314
It's always been about you.

47:41.316 --> 47:45.017
Alex Moran this. Alex Moran that.

47:45.019 --> 47:46.551
Well, guess what, Moran,

47:46.553 --> 47:48.889
newsflash.

47:53.394 --> 47:56.195
Newsflash.

47:56.197 --> 47:58.097
Dick Dawg.

47:58.099 --> 48:00.566
Escort this selfish jerk off my property.

48:00.568 --> 48:02.501
- What?
- Then write yourself a check.

48:02.503 --> 48:03.702
Fuck yeah!

48:03.704 --> 48:05.338
Hey, Thad! You can't do this.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.671
You can't kick me out of my own house.

48:06.673 --> 48:09.509
It's not your house anymore, cock tease!

48:24.258 --> 48:25.691
All right!

48:25.693 --> 48:27.559
First one to bring me a mojito

48:27.561 --> 48:30.162
wins a whap session in
the ham sandwich room!

48:52.787 --> 48:54.419
- Hey, man, balloon?
- Thank you.

48:54.421 --> 48:56.354
I invited you here,

48:56.356 --> 48:58.591
you said yes, so why aren't we hanging out?

48:58.593 --> 49:00.258
Wait, I'm confused.

49:00.260 --> 49:03.028
Do you or do you not have blueberry waffles

49:03.030 --> 49:04.329
because I'm starving.

49:04.331 --> 49:06.064
- Hey!
- No.

49:06.066 --> 49:07.100
- What?
- Get out of here.

49:07.102 --> 49:09.068
- No.
- You're not invited into this conversation.

49:09.070 --> 49:11.303
Okay. I think I get
why you're pissed at me,

49:11.305 --> 49:12.704
but Holly is not gay.

49:12.706 --> 49:14.640
And you can't turn her gay.

49:14.642 --> 49:17.575
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

49:17.577 --> 49:19.980
Did you know you can eat bark?

49:27.354 --> 49:31.524
Whoa! Your tongue is bonkers.

49:31.526 --> 49:33.494
All right.

49:39.099 --> 49:40.499
All right.

49:40.501 --> 49:42.334
Okay. There it is.

49:42.336 --> 49:44.236
Alex, your lips are sick.

49:44.238 --> 49:45.805
Thank you.

49:45.807 --> 49:48.009
Hmm?

49:55.115 --> 49:58.617
Your tongue really is bonkers.

49:58.619 --> 50:01.155
Why didn't I remember...

50:03.157 --> 50:05.292
Why didn't you remember what?

50:08.095 --> 50:10.296
Holy shitballs.

50:10.298 --> 50:12.566
Are you guys...

50:14.235 --> 50:16.167
Fuck a duck.

50:16.169 --> 50:16.869
Alex.

50:16.871 --> 50:18.370
Hmm?

50:18.372 --> 50:20.872
Why didn't we ever talk about it?

50:20.874 --> 50:24.109
We hooked up, it was good and then...

50:24.111 --> 50:26.611
I... I liked you.

50:26.613 --> 50:28.280
But you said that you were gay.

50:28.282 --> 50:30.282
I was a sophomore.

50:30.284 --> 50:32.184
That's what sophomore girls do.

50:32.186 --> 50:34.519
Freshman year we're drunk and slutty.

50:34.521 --> 50:37.222
Sophomore year we experiment
with our sexuality.

50:37.224 --> 50:38.557
Junior year we start caring about school,

50:38.559 --> 50:40.459
and senior year anything goes.

50:40.461 --> 50:43.229
It's called the college experience.

50:43.231 --> 50:44.597
This is my last year of college.

50:44.599 --> 50:47.566
And I can't...

50:47.568 --> 50:49.135
I can't have a girlfriend.

50:49.137 --> 50:51.403
And you shouldn't.

50:51.405 --> 50:53.905
But if you do...

50:53.907 --> 50:56.309
It should be me.

50:59.713 --> 51:01.213
Oh, my God.

51:01.215 --> 51:03.483
Are we all gonna do it?

51:51.731 --> 51:53.832
What is going on here?

51:53.834 --> 51:56.470
I think they're trying to fuck.

52:08.282 --> 52:10.548
So... What's going on here?

52:10.550 --> 52:14.986
I think these guys are trying to fuck

52:14.988 --> 52:17.689
and those guys are talking about it.

52:20.227 --> 52:22.229
Beer's inside?

52:40.814 --> 52:42.580
Houseboy!

52:42.582 --> 52:45.919
Get your ass in here, houseboy!

52:48.356 --> 52:50.289
Houseboy!

52:50.291 --> 52:53.992
I need more olives for
my martini, god damn it!

52:53.994 --> 52:55.361
Thad?

52:55.363 --> 52:56.928
He can't hear you.

52:56.930 --> 52:58.763
Why not?

52:58.765 --> 53:00.865
You're looking at 15 years in the future.

53:03.704 --> 53:05.537
You're serious?

53:05.539 --> 53:06.671
Fifteen years in the future

53:06.673 --> 53:08.439
Thad is living in the Goat House?

53:08.441 --> 53:09.941
Oh, no, he never left.

53:09.943 --> 53:12.278
You know, uh, Thadland became Thad World

53:12.280 --> 53:13.379
and, uh, he's been here ever since.

53:13.381 --> 53:15.381
Houseboy!

53:15.383 --> 53:16.481
And you're living with him?

53:16.483 --> 53:17.816
Me? Oh, no, no, no.

53:17.818 --> 53:20.486
I am long gone. Long gone.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.488
I, uh, I died at Thadland.

53:22.490 --> 53:23.888
Fell off the ferris wheel jerking off.

53:23.890 --> 53:26.758
- You died?
- Houseboy!

53:26.760 --> 53:29.662
Wait, then who's houseboy?

53:29.664 --> 53:32.030
Sorry, bro-beans. I was
polishing your trophies.

53:32.032 --> 53:34.733
Also, your car is washed,

53:34.735 --> 53:36.334
your laundry's done,

53:36.336 --> 53:37.436
and your chrome pocket pussy

53:37.438 --> 53:39.905
is all buffed up and ready to go.

53:39.907 --> 53:41.472
No way.

53:41.474 --> 53:44.376
- Yeah. Yeah, and you're fat, too.
- What?

53:44.378 --> 53:46.544
No, no, no. No way that is happening.

53:46.546 --> 53:49.515
You made this happen. You should be pumped!

53:49.517 --> 53:51.550
I mean, yes, you sacrificed
everything that was good in your life

53:51.552 --> 53:52.617
along the way

53:52.619 --> 53:53.986
but you got your Goat House

53:53.988 --> 53:56.490
and you and Thad are happy living here.

54:00.660 --> 54:02.827
What, what about, what about Mary Jo?

54:02.829 --> 54:04.430
She, uh, she couldn't wait around.

54:06.666 --> 54:07.899
I'm real sorry I got in the way

54:07.901 --> 54:08.966
of your sneeze there, boss.

54:08.968 --> 54:09.834
That's bullshit.

54:09.836 --> 54:12.070
No. You want to know what's bullshit?

54:12.072 --> 54:13.705
Toilet duty in heaven.

54:13.707 --> 54:15.740
Jesus says if I don't
clean the toilets by 6:00,

54:15.742 --> 54:17.343
he's gonna give me a spanking.

54:17.345 --> 54:18.910
Jesus spanks you?

54:18.912 --> 54:19.711
Well, it's more like a tickling thing,

54:19.713 --> 54:21.412
but either way I just don't like it.

54:21.414 --> 54:22.414
See you around, pal.

54:22.416 --> 54:24.682
Houseboy, my hemorrhoid needs cleaning!

54:24.684 --> 54:27.352
Wait, Sammy!

54:27.354 --> 54:28.653
We got to fix this.

54:28.655 --> 54:29.787
You're on your own.

54:29.789 --> 54:31.523
I don't want to get spanked.

54:31.525 --> 54:32.557
Sammy!

54:32.559 --> 54:33.624
Coming, Jesus!

54:33.626 --> 54:35.928
Sammy! Sammy!

54:48.409 --> 54:50.611
What the fuck?

54:52.813 --> 54:55.481
Sammy!

54:55.483 --> 54:57.785
Mary Jo?

55:02.122 --> 55:05.023
Hey!

55:05.025 --> 55:07.792
Hey! Yes!

55:07.794 --> 55:10.662
Thank you so much for stopping.

55:10.664 --> 55:11.829
Shilo?

55:11.831 --> 55:14.932
Ooh! Alex Moran.

55:14.934 --> 55:16.033
What the hell are you doing out here, man?

55:16.035 --> 55:17.102
You look nuts.

55:17.104 --> 55:18.704
It's a long story, man.

55:18.706 --> 55:20.905
Where are we? I gotta get
back to the Goat House.

55:20.907 --> 55:21.840
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's where I'm going!

55:21.842 --> 55:23.841
Hop in, man. To Thadland!

55:23.843 --> 55:25.577
I can't believe you guys didn't invite me!

55:25.579 --> 55:26.979
- Thadland?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:26.981 --> 55:28.981
That was last night. It's over.

55:28.983 --> 55:30.816
Oh, no, no, no.

55:30.818 --> 55:32.517
I've been seeing the
commercials all weekend long.

55:32.519 --> 55:35.454
- Commercials?
- Biggest, baddest party of all time.

55:35.456 --> 55:37.155
They've got games and rides

55:37.157 --> 55:39.024
and a contest for the best abs.

55:39.026 --> 55:41.593
Now let me ask you.

55:41.595 --> 55:43.528
Who's taking home that prize?

55:43.530 --> 55:45.129
- Uh...
- Go ahead.

55:45.131 --> 55:46.664
Touch it.

55:46.666 --> 55:47.832
I'd rather not.

55:47.834 --> 55:48.934
- No, no, no.
- No, I'm good.

55:48.936 --> 55:50.936
They're just amazing abs.
They're not gonna bite you.

55:50.938 --> 55:53.671
Wait, what day is it today?

55:53.673 --> 55:55.541
It's Monday.

55:57.811 --> 55:59.812
No fucking way.

56:02.849 --> 56:04.149
<i>Do you like fun?</i>

56:04.151 --> 56:05.983
<i>Do you like excitement?</i>

56:05.985 --> 56:08.187
<i>Well, we... Well, then
come on down to Thadland!</i>

56:08.189 --> 56:10.789
<i>We've got lots of
that kind of stuff!</i>

56:10.791 --> 56:12.490
<i>Whoo!</i>

56:12.492 --> 56:13.626
<i>I'm Thad Castle!</i>

56:13.628 --> 56:15.760
<i>And whether it's
bouncing with sloots...</i>

56:15.762 --> 56:17.797
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

56:18.832 --> 56:22.468
<i>Or sweet beach on a ferris wheel.</i>

56:22.470 --> 56:24.872
<i>It even snows cocaine here!</i>

56:27.508 --> 56:28.673
<i>Here's fun facts about Thadland.</i>

56:28.675 --> 56:29.908
<i>It was created three days ago.</i>

56:29.910 --> 56:31.910
<i>Our only currency is checks.</i>

56:31.912 --> 56:34.111
<i>And we're open 23/7, nine
days a week, 385 days a year.</i>

56:34.113 --> 56:36.113
<i>So round up your bro-beans</i>

56:36.115 --> 56:39.651
<i>and come on down to the place
where the fun never ends!</i>

56:39.653 --> 56:41.586
<i>Fuck you, Walt Disney!</i>

56:41.588 --> 56:43.488
<i>This is Thadland!</i>

57:02.742 --> 57:04.675
This is disgusting.

57:04.677 --> 57:07.178
What happened to the party?

57:07.180 --> 57:09.914
It's right here?

57:09.916 --> 57:11.249
Hey, ladies.

57:11.251 --> 57:13.519
Check out these abs.

57:41.081 --> 57:42.747
This fucking tastes so bad.

57:42.749 --> 57:44.582
Sammy...

57:44.584 --> 57:45.684
Alex!

57:45.686 --> 57:47.251
Holy shit, man.

57:47.253 --> 57:50.187
You know, people think
that you're fucking dead.

57:50.189 --> 57:51.722
I'm not dead. I'm right here.

57:51.724 --> 57:53.158
What is going on here?

57:53.160 --> 57:55.760
Thadland.

57:55.762 --> 57:57.662
It's been going on for quite some time.

57:57.664 --> 57:59.597
You know, these fucking crazy guys,

57:59.599 --> 58:01.265
are so much fun, it's amazing.

58:01.267 --> 58:03.200
God, this is all my fault.

58:03.202 --> 58:04.769
Yeah. Oh, shit, man.

58:04.771 --> 58:06.137
Do you want some food? I feel weird.

58:06.139 --> 58:08.240
- Do you want some?
- No, I...

58:08.242 --> 58:10.675
Is that?

58:10.677 --> 58:11.809
Yeah, things got a little
weird between Billy and I.

58:11.811 --> 58:14.745
You know, uh, he bit me, so uh,

58:14.747 --> 58:16.847
I'm biting him.

58:16.849 --> 58:18.950
Jesus, Sammy.

58:18.952 --> 58:21.687
This, this has to end. Where's Thad?

58:21.689 --> 58:23.021
I haven't seen Thad in a little while.

58:23.023 --> 58:24.756
But get this.

58:24.758 --> 58:26.057
Just yesterday,

58:26.059 --> 58:27.291
he almost remembered my name.

58:27.293 --> 58:29.327
- Oh, good.
- He called me, "Biscuit."

58:29.329 --> 58:31.095
Which, you know, to me is pretty close.

58:31.097 --> 58:33.265
You know, cause it's like...

58:33.267 --> 58:35.367
- Sam-my!
- I know, it's...

58:35.369 --> 58:37.035
- Bis-cuit!
- It's not really that close at all.

58:37.037 --> 58:38.637
If you think about it,

58:38.639 --> 58:40.939
and you sound it out.

58:40.941 --> 58:42.740
Biscuit's like tomato.

58:42.742 --> 58:44.642
I'm gonna go find Thad. You just enjoy it.

58:44.644 --> 58:46.546
Biscuit!

58:58.726 --> 59:01.061
What the fuck.

59:02.329 --> 59:04.863
Donnie!

59:04.865 --> 59:05.930
Donnie!

59:05.932 --> 59:08.735
Hey! Radon, stop the ride!

59:09.836 --> 59:12.037
It's just that,

59:12.039 --> 59:14.773
all it would take is one of you
to show me respect as a coach

59:14.775 --> 59:16.841
and not just your friend and
everyone else would be on board.

59:16.843 --> 59:19.845
No. It's not like that,
dude. We respect you.

59:19.847 --> 59:22.213
- Really?
- Hey, Coach Summers, fuck you!

59:24.418 --> 59:26.954
- Not cool, man!
- Donnie!

59:28.055 --> 59:28.954
I'm so glad I found you.

59:28.956 --> 59:32.124
Yeah, Thad, what's with the bracelets?

59:32.126 --> 59:34.059
You don't like them?

59:34.061 --> 59:35.660
It's just I asked you not to
make a big deal out of this

59:35.662 --> 59:38.062
and instead you manufactured
thousands of bracelets

59:38.064 --> 59:40.064
and handed them out to everyone here.

59:40.066 --> 59:41.666
You're welcome, bro-beans.

59:41.668 --> 59:44.337
Hey, Thad. Congrats on all your success.

59:49.142 --> 59:50.809
Dick Dawg!

59:50.811 --> 59:52.077
Dick Dawg, get over here.

59:52.079 --> 59:54.812
I got something you're gonna love. Watch.

59:54.814 --> 59:56.749
Watch where you're stepping, dude.

59:58.052 --> 01:00:00.385
Go ahead. Open it.

01:00:00.387 --> 01:00:02.120
I think I can tell what it is, Thad.

01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:03.988
Open it!

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.858
Open it!

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.869
Yeah. Yeah!

01:00:20.374 --> 01:00:22.307
I bought you a guy.

01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:24.209
I can see that.

01:00:24.211 --> 01:00:26.278
Go ahead. Whap his dick around.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.979
Whap, whap.

01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:30.916
I'd rather not, Thad.

01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:32.751
What's the matter, you don't like him?

01:00:32.753 --> 01:00:35.053
No. I do, he, he's great.

01:00:35.055 --> 01:00:36.921
He's already paid for. Whap him.

01:00:36.923 --> 01:00:39.157
Look, I'll do it. Watch.

01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:41.059
Whap. Whap, whap, whap.

01:00:41.061 --> 01:00:42.227
Whap, whap, whap, whap, whap,

01:00:42.229 --> 01:00:44.195
whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap,

01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:46.997
whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap.

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:50.468
Whap it. I'll leave you two alone.

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:52.403
You're welcome, bro-beans.

01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:56.108
- Dick Dawg!
- Have fun, man.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:57.908
Sorry about them.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:01.245
- I'm Frank.
- I'm Donnie.

01:01:01.247 --> 01:01:03.349
I'm gonna go.

01:01:07.854 --> 01:01:09.488
Coach Daniels!

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.888
So glad you could make it.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:11.756
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:11.758 --> 01:01:13.358
But what the hell is this all about?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.392
Just a friendly little gathering

01:01:15.394 --> 01:01:18.798
where I reveal to the world the
kind of person you really are.

01:01:20.066 --> 01:01:21.867
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:26.271
Like when they steal my hat

01:01:26.273 --> 01:01:29.073
and then laugh at me, it hurts.

01:01:29.075 --> 01:01:32.843
You know, I put on a brave
face, but I'm a real human being.

01:01:32.845 --> 01:01:34.945
Human beings means people.

01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:36.180
Exactly. And like...

01:01:36.182 --> 01:01:38.950
Larry, I need you.

01:01:38.952 --> 01:01:41.986
Alex, come play with me in the bath tub.

01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:43.287
Maybe another time.

01:01:43.289 --> 01:01:45.823
Larry, I need your help right now.

01:01:45.825 --> 01:01:47.392
I need you to round up the whole
team and meet me out front, okay?

01:01:47.394 --> 01:01:48.459
Very funny. Come on, man.

01:01:48.461 --> 01:01:50.463
I'm serious, Larry.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.800
Coach Summers. This party is over.

01:01:55.802 --> 01:01:57.968
Round 'em up.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.805
Don't do this, Moran.

01:01:59.807 --> 01:02:01.573
We need you right now, coach.

01:02:01.575 --> 01:02:03.809
Round up this team right now.

01:02:03.811 --> 01:02:05.176
- Man, I...
- Round 'em up!

01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:06.477
- No.
- Round 'em up, Coach Summers!

01:02:06.479 --> 01:02:07.146
- Not you too.
- Round 'em up!

01:02:07.148 --> 01:02:08.946
- Not you too.
- Round 'em up!

01:02:08.948 --> 01:02:10.849
Round 'em up!

01:02:10.851 --> 01:02:12.149
Get out of there!

01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:14.420
Get of there, Coach Summers! Yeah!

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:19.323
I'll see you out front.

01:02:21.928 --> 01:02:25.264
Mountain goats... Round up!

01:02:27.968 --> 01:02:29.367
Check out this guy.

01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:31.436
He's been asleep for, like, two hours.

01:02:31.438 --> 01:02:33.338
I can't wake him up.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.472
Holly, where is Mary Jo?

01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:37.508
- She's with Chad.
- Who?

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:41.512
Chad. You know, like Chadland?

01:02:41.514 --> 01:02:42.847
Right over there.

01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:45.886
Giddy-up!

01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:48.285
To the stables!

01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:50.088
Holy shit!

01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:55.061
Marco!

01:02:56.095 --> 01:02:58.430
Marco!

01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:01.932
<i>I just want to say that in
spite of all the rumors,</i>

01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:04.503
<i>I was not drunk when I
crashed my motorcycle.</i>

01:03:05.972 --> 01:03:08.039
<i>And furthermore...</i>

01:03:15.115 --> 01:03:16.548
<i>You know what?</i>

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.082
<i>That was a lie.</i>

01:03:18.084 --> 01:03:19.651
<i>I was drunk.</i>

01:03:19.653 --> 01:03:22.387
<i>In fact, I'm a little
drunk right now.</i>

01:03:22.389 --> 01:03:23.988
<i>I was hammered</i>

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.390
<i>when I crashed my motorcycle,</i>

01:03:25.392 --> 01:03:27.091
<i>and I was just about to have</i>

01:03:27.093 --> 01:03:29.260
<i>an enchanted moment</i>

01:03:29.262 --> 01:03:31.062
<i>with this girl,</i>

01:03:31.064 --> 01:03:33.932
<i>who happens to be a
very wonderful person.</i>

01:03:33.934 --> 01:03:38.068
<i>So, you can all go fuck yourselves.</i>

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.072
<i>And go Goats.</i>

01:03:41.407 --> 01:03:44.041
<i>Well, alrighty then.</i>

01:03:44.043 --> 01:03:46.544
<i>Let's open it up for
questions, shall we?</i>

01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:49.546
<i>Coach! Coach! Julia King from CAN.</i>

01:03:49.548 --> 01:03:51.249
<i>What can you tell us about
your feelings on Thadland?</i>

01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:52.550
<i>Have you been?</i>

01:03:52.552 --> 01:03:54.452
<i>And can you comment on
Thad Castle's open bashing</i>

01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:55.387
<i>of the late Walt Disney?</i>

01:03:55.389 --> 01:03:57.289
<i>He's called him, and I quote,</i>

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:58.622
<i>"A short, anti-Semite...</i>

01:03:58.624 --> 01:04:00.492
<i>"with less imagination in his whole</i>

01:04:00.494 --> 01:04:04.461
<i>"Jew-hating body than I have
in the tip of my pee-hole."</i>

01:04:04.463 --> 01:04:05.664
<i>He said "pee-hole?"</i>

01:04:05.666 --> 01:04:06.765
- <i>He did.</i>
- <i>Well, you know,</i>

01:04:06.767 --> 01:04:08.999
<i>I don't think any
of those allegations</i>

01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:10.535
<i>were proven to be true.</i>

01:04:10.537 --> 01:04:12.202
<i>So I don't want to comment on Mr...</i>

01:04:13.407 --> 01:04:16.374
What about the drug use at Thadland?

01:04:16.376 --> 01:04:18.276
Why does Thad Castle hate the French?

01:04:18.278 --> 01:04:20.044
That's the question you idiots have?

01:04:20.046 --> 01:04:21.211
<i>Thadland?</i>

01:04:21.213 --> 01:04:23.247
<i>Ask him about the drinking.</i>

01:04:23.249 --> 01:04:25.216
<i>Ask him about the driving.</i>

01:04:25.218 --> 01:04:27.619
<i>The accident with the little chick.</i>

01:04:27.621 --> 01:04:30.456
<i>Ask him some of this stuff. What?</i>

01:04:35.561 --> 01:04:37.363
Coach!

01:04:44.704 --> 01:04:47.104
Oh, yeah, this is great.

01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:49.673
Can wear you all the way to...

01:04:49.675 --> 01:04:51.075
Sammy!

01:04:51.077 --> 01:04:54.480
Alex! Holy shit, what's up, buddy?

01:04:55.581 --> 01:04:57.182
I really need your help.

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:58.115
I need you to sneak me
back into the Goat House.

01:04:58.117 --> 01:05:00.151
Why?

01:05:00.153 --> 01:05:02.320
Oh, my God, that's right,
'cause you're banished!

01:05:02.322 --> 01:05:04.655
Hey, everybody, Alex is back!

01:05:04.657 --> 01:05:06.191
Whoo! We gotta keep it down though.

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:07.492
We gotta keep it down.

01:05:07.494 --> 01:05:08.526
But I can help you out. Follow me.

01:05:08.528 --> 01:05:10.061
Follow me, pal.

01:05:10.063 --> 01:05:11.428
You're not gonna believe this.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:14.566
I fucking, I ate basically the whole goat.

01:05:14.568 --> 01:05:16.066
- Did you boil it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:17.635
Thad is pissed at you.

01:05:17.637 --> 01:05:19.671
He's declared your name a swear word.

01:05:19.673 --> 01:05:22.073
Actually it's pretty cool if you ask me.

01:05:22.075 --> 01:05:23.307
Why is that cool?

01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:25.075
At least he knows your name.

01:05:25.077 --> 01:05:27.278
Harmon, you got a visitor, buddy.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.646
Alex, you're alive.

01:05:29.648 --> 01:05:31.582
I thought you were dead or something.

01:05:31.584 --> 01:05:34.251
I almost was, thanks to your balloons.

01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:37.155
This drug affects different
people in different ways.

01:05:37.157 --> 01:05:39.224
Me, I grew up on the stuff.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:41.026
It was like formula to
me when I was a baby.

01:05:41.028 --> 01:05:42.629
What is it?

01:05:45.432 --> 01:05:47.298
Don't ask yourself a question

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.767
that you don't want the answer to.

01:05:49.769 --> 01:05:52.504
Just go on back up to the
party and enjoy yourself.

01:05:52.506 --> 01:05:55.140
Harmon. What is in your balloons?

01:05:55.142 --> 01:05:56.274
It's shit.

01:05:56.276 --> 01:05:58.776
It's not shit...

01:05:58.778 --> 01:06:00.378
It's jenkum.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.079
Okay, what the fuck is jenkum?

01:06:02.081 --> 01:06:03.247
- Shit.
- It's not...

01:06:03.249 --> 01:06:04.349
- He said shit again.
- Shit.

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:05.682
It's poop fumes

01:06:05.684 --> 01:06:07.651
and pee fumes.

01:06:07.653 --> 01:06:09.620
It's very popular in the south.

01:06:09.622 --> 01:06:11.155
See, what I've done here is

01:06:11.157 --> 01:06:12.590
I've rerouted these sewer pipes

01:06:12.592 --> 01:06:14.526
into this steel tank.

01:06:14.528 --> 01:06:16.794
And then whenever anyone
uses the facilities,

01:06:16.796 --> 01:06:18.562
it collects here where
it's allowed to ferment

01:06:18.564 --> 01:06:20.497
at a very high temperature.

01:06:20.499 --> 01:06:23.100
Then it's simply a matter
of filling these balloons

01:06:23.102 --> 01:06:25.470
with the fermented fumes, <i>et voila.</i>

01:06:25.472 --> 01:06:28.472
This stuff will knock
you straight on your ass.

01:06:28.474 --> 01:06:30.108
Which is ironic considering

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.678
that's where it all
started in the first place.

01:06:34.213 --> 01:06:36.180
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- No.

01:06:36.182 --> 01:06:38.349
We've been down here for days

01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:40.484
messing around with different temperatures,

01:06:40.486 --> 01:06:43.254
more poop, less pee, more pee, less poop...

01:06:43.256 --> 01:06:45.189
No, no, no.

01:06:45.191 --> 01:06:47.624
This experiment ends right now.

01:06:47.626 --> 01:06:50.562
I lost two days of my life to this shit!

01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:52.763
And dignity. Stop huffing that!

01:06:52.765 --> 01:06:54.399
Jesus Christ!

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.666
Shut it down, Harmon.

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:57.836
- No, no, no, what about Thad?
- Forget Thad!

01:06:57.838 --> 01:06:59.236
This is my house.

01:06:59.238 --> 01:07:00.872
And I'm your captain.

01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:02.707
Now shut it down, Harmon.

01:07:02.709 --> 01:07:04.611
Shut it down.

01:07:07.447 --> 01:07:09.416
Consider it done, Captain.

01:07:16.456 --> 01:07:18.356
Have you seen Thad?

01:07:18.358 --> 01:07:21.093
Thad's upstairs.

01:07:59.198 --> 01:08:01.300
Are you an assassin?

01:08:04.204 --> 01:08:06.206
Thad?

01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:13.311
You can't kill me.

01:08:13.313 --> 01:08:15.548
I'm not killable.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.953
I'm not here to kill you.

01:08:22.955 --> 01:08:26.158
I'm here to tell you
that this party is over.

01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:31.428
Guys, I have no time to explain.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.828
You don't want to be
sucking on those balloons.

01:08:32.831 --> 01:08:33.930
Trust me.

01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:36.234
What balloons?

01:08:36.236 --> 01:08:37.836
These balloons?

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:40.571
Please stop.

01:08:40.573 --> 01:08:41.971
Thad, stop doing that.

01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:43.809
Thad, stop!

01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:47.514
Thank you.

01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:50.948
Hey, hey.

01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:52.350
Don't let him do that.

01:08:52.352 --> 01:08:53.751
What do you care?

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:54.953
You got what you wanted.

01:08:54.955 --> 01:08:56.319
The house is safe.

01:08:56.322 --> 01:08:58.622
I do care, all right?

01:08:58.625 --> 01:08:59.689
And I don't know if what happened

01:08:59.692 --> 01:09:02.359
between us was real or not,

01:09:02.362 --> 01:09:04.361
but I meant every word I said to you.

01:09:04.363 --> 01:09:06.596
Then prove it.

01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:07.899
Hey!

01:09:07.901 --> 01:09:09.399
Enough!

01:09:09.402 --> 01:09:12.502
This is about me! Not you a-holes!

01:09:12.504 --> 01:09:15.907
Okay, let's talk about you.

01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:18.975
How about we start with
what the hell is going on.

01:09:18.978 --> 01:09:20.278
You were a number one

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.546
draft pick in the NFL.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.582
Why aren't you at practice?

01:09:24.584 --> 01:09:26.885
And what do you even want with my house?

01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:35.292
Let's not do this again, <i>Senor.</i>

01:09:35.295 --> 01:09:36.926
Officer, I carry in my possession

01:09:36.929 --> 01:09:38.328
information which may interest you

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:40.631
and your tiny little benevolent fund.

01:09:40.634 --> 01:09:41.832
I didn't catch any of that.

01:09:41.835 --> 01:09:43.670
Look at the papers!

01:09:52.379 --> 01:09:53.444
I need all available units

01:09:53.446 --> 01:09:56.346
to Blue Mountain State
Campus. All available units.

01:09:56.348 --> 01:09:57.949
There goes the department booze cruise.

01:09:57.951 --> 01:09:59.650
Argh!

01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:01.653
Thad, we were teammates for three years.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:04.422
You've got to trust me. What is happening?

01:10:04.424 --> 01:10:07.624
This may come as a surprise to you,

01:10:07.626 --> 01:10:11.796
but I'm not the super smart Alan
Einstein that everyone thinks I am.

01:10:11.798 --> 01:10:13.998
No. Don't say that.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.400
If I told you the truth, you'd
think I was the biggest idiot.

01:10:16.402 --> 01:10:18.470
Never.

01:10:23.343 --> 01:10:24.941
I'm not going pro.

01:10:24.943 --> 01:10:26.711
What?

01:10:26.713 --> 01:10:28.578
Wait, I saw the draft, Thad.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.913
We all saw the draft.

01:10:29.915 --> 01:10:32.050
Now you're mad at me. I
knew you'd get mad at me.

01:10:32.052 --> 01:10:33.918
- I'm not mad at you.
- Yes, you are.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.653
The draft was real,

01:10:35.655 --> 01:10:37.922
and the contract was real,

01:10:37.924 --> 01:10:40.858
but then,

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.793
I bought a zoo...

01:10:42.795 --> 01:10:44.861
And I was messing around
with that big animal

01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:46.931
with the horn growing out of its face.

01:10:46.933 --> 01:10:48.833
A rhinoceros?

01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:50.635
Sure.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.970
And the stupid thing stabbed
me with his stupid horn.

01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:54.471
My coach found out

01:10:54.473 --> 01:10:55.873
and they canceled my contract.

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:57.677
No, no, no, stop stop stop!

01:11:00.647 --> 01:11:02.846
What?

01:11:02.848 --> 01:11:04.614
How long have you known about this?

01:11:04.616 --> 01:11:06.883
Since the day before you
and I met at that restaurant.

01:11:06.885 --> 01:11:08.687
Wha...

01:11:10.423 --> 01:11:12.824
So this, this book...

01:11:12.826 --> 01:11:16.093
This, this, this dream, it was all a lie?

01:11:16.095 --> 01:11:20.364
I drew that the night
before I gave it to you.

01:11:20.366 --> 01:11:23.834
<i>I imagined a party in my honor.</i>

01:11:23.836 --> 01:11:26.104
<i>A place that was safe and warm</i>

01:11:26.106 --> 01:11:28.806
<i>and I'd never ever ever ever leave.</i>

01:11:43.522 --> 01:11:45.123
You motherfucker!

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:46.023
What the...

01:11:46.025 --> 01:11:47.557
Holy shit!

01:11:47.559 --> 01:11:48.993
Actually, that's a lie too.

01:11:48.995 --> 01:11:51.762
I didn't draw those pictures.

01:11:51.764 --> 01:11:53.631
I traced them.

01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:15.886
So you knew your contract was void?

01:12:15.888 --> 01:12:17.154
How did you pay for all this?

01:12:17.156 --> 01:12:19.056
Checks.

01:12:19.058 --> 01:12:21.661
But they weren't real. I
just ordered them online.

01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:27.931
You have no money?

01:12:27.933 --> 01:12:29.766
Who else knows about this?

01:12:29.768 --> 01:12:32.736
Just me and Dick Dawg

01:12:32.738 --> 01:12:34.471
and the Dean.

01:12:34.473 --> 01:12:36.140
Olivares knows about
this? How does he know?

01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:37.441
Dick Dawg told him.

01:12:37.443 --> 01:12:38.543
Why would he do that, Thad?

01:12:38.545 --> 01:12:40.077
Because I told him to.

01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:42.078
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Are you gonna

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.847
help me? I'm in real deep shit.

01:12:43.849 --> 01:12:46.184
I started my own sneaker
line, for Christ sake.

01:12:46.186 --> 01:12:48.218
I made my own Hall of Fame jacket.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.156
I can't face them.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:53.793
I'd rather be dead.

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:58.765
Is that what this is all about?

01:13:00.599 --> 01:13:02.099
This?

01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:03.601
- This drawing.
- Tracing.

01:13:03.603 --> 01:13:06.703
Tracing in your book.

01:13:06.705 --> 01:13:08.573
It's you?

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:12.044
In heaven.

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.111
- No. No way.
- Yes.

01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:16.780
- Absolutely not.
- Yes.

01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:18.248
- No, I'm not doing it. No.
- Yes, you have to!

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.083
- I'm not doing it.
- That's the deal! You have to help me!

01:13:20.085 --> 01:13:22.185
I bought you this house!

01:13:22.187 --> 01:13:24.055
Technically you didn't!

01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:25.623
But goddammit!

01:13:26.759 --> 01:13:27.792
Shhh!

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:29.060
Thad?

01:13:29.062 --> 01:13:30.660
Yes.

01:13:30.662 --> 01:13:33.129
- If I help you out of this...
- Yes?

01:13:33.131 --> 01:13:35.099
All debts are paid. I owe you nothing.

01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:37.103
Deal.

01:13:39.839 --> 01:13:41.905
All right. Shit!

01:13:41.907 --> 01:13:42.974
I got a plan.

01:13:42.976 --> 01:13:44.574
Shit.

01:13:44.576 --> 01:13:45.877
I'm gonna need Dick Dawg.

01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:48.279
Shit! Goddamn it!

01:13:48.281 --> 01:13:50.483
Shit.

01:13:53.253 --> 01:13:55.455
Ohhh!

01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:07.198
Well!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.065
- Jesus Christ!
- If it isn't the guy I don't remember.

01:14:09.067 --> 01:14:11.302
Oh, God, why are you naked?

01:14:11.304 --> 01:14:13.003
Wait, what's on your head?

01:14:13.005 --> 01:14:14.838
Oh, I'm wearing the last guy
who tried to mess with me.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.972
What the fuck do you think you're

01:14:15.974 --> 01:14:18.109
doing down here in my lab, pal?

01:14:18.111 --> 01:14:20.043
None of your business, pal.

01:14:20.045 --> 01:14:22.078
None of my fucking business?

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.748
Well, down here...

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.653
This is fucking Sammy's world, pal.

01:14:28.655 --> 01:14:30.755
Who is Sammy?

01:14:32.191 --> 01:14:34.758
It's me! I'm Sammy!

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.294
You listen to me, and
you listen to me good...

01:14:37.296 --> 01:14:39.297
you touch another valve on
my fucking jug right here,

01:14:39.299 --> 01:14:40.830
you're fucking going down, buddy.

01:14:40.832 --> 01:14:42.566
- Oh, no, no. Wait wait. Is that?
- Yeah.

01:14:42.568 --> 01:14:43.935
- Ok, um. You don't wanna?
- Don't you...

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:45.669
- You don't wanna...
- Eh, no...

01:14:45.671 --> 01:14:47.171
- Oh, I shouldn't...
- Hey, I swear...

01:14:47.173 --> 01:14:47.939
- If I were you...
- If I were to do that?

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.806
Oh, wow!

01:14:49.808 --> 01:14:51.775
Whoo! I don't know if
that was such a good idea.

01:14:55.647 --> 01:14:59.050
Oh, God, I really don't
wanna fight you, okay, man?

01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:06.893
So, the plan...

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.327
- What do I do again?
- Oh, my God!

01:15:09.329 --> 01:15:11.695
This is the police, open up!

01:15:11.697 --> 01:15:13.096
- Whoa! God!
- Whoa!

01:15:13.098 --> 01:15:14.164
Shots fired!

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:16.132
Oh, God! Oh!

01:15:20.772 --> 01:15:22.373
Christ, you keep that thing loaded?

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.342
Why would I have an unloaded gun?

01:15:24.344 --> 01:15:26.110
Mama!

01:15:34.019 --> 01:15:35.086
Oh, yeah!

01:15:35.088 --> 01:15:37.288
Ahhh!

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.090
Ahhh! Hey!

01:15:39.092 --> 01:15:40.958
Oh, right in the eyes.
Look, we really don't

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.827
have time to fight right now.

01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:43.927
Oh, okay, yeah, you don't
wanna fucking fight this?

01:15:45.031 --> 01:15:46.029
Ugh!

01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:48.034
Oh, gosh!

01:15:50.068 --> 01:15:52.002
Ugh!

01:15:52.004 --> 01:15:53.904
You're showing a tremendous
amount of heart right now.

01:15:53.906 --> 01:15:55.306
I admire your tenacity, I really do.

01:15:55.308 --> 01:15:57.941
But, every pipe in this
place is about to explode.

01:15:57.943 --> 01:15:59.275
You need to just give
up already, all right?

01:15:59.277 --> 01:16:00.977
Get outta here. Jesus!

01:16:00.979 --> 01:16:03.114
Okay, okay. How's this
for a fucking explosion?

01:16:04.651 --> 01:16:06.316
Get your dick off my back!

01:16:06.318 --> 01:16:07.885
Get your back off my dick!

01:16:14.826 --> 01:16:16.726
What the fuck was that?

01:16:16.728 --> 01:16:17.828
Oh, God!

01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.329
Oh, no!

01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:22.432
Oh, what the fuck, man! Holy shit!

01:16:22.434 --> 01:16:24.235
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

01:16:24.237 --> 01:16:26.038
It's the only way!

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:32.709
Make sure you tell people my story.

01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:34.878
I don't think that'll be a problem!

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.682
Let's go!

01:16:44.057 --> 01:16:46.356
Oh! Get off me.

01:16:46.358 --> 01:16:48.825
What's happening?

01:16:48.827 --> 01:16:51.028
Hey, you gotta get outta
here, man, right now.

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.329
I don't wanna die fighting
a naked guy. Come on!

01:16:53.331 --> 01:16:55.099
Truce!

01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:58.034
All right, truce. Hey, you
fight like a goddamn champion.

01:16:58.036 --> 01:16:59.069
Oh, shoot, look at that. Shit!

01:16:59.071 --> 01:17:01.072
What?

01:17:46.986 --> 01:17:49.021
Get back!

01:18:09.776 --> 01:18:11.711
Holy shit.

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.949
The lab.

01:18:19.951 --> 01:18:21.753
The beer.

01:18:23.255 --> 01:18:27.490
Alex, your house.

01:18:27.492 --> 01:18:29.327
It was just a house.

01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:40.203
I did it! I did it! I win! I am the coach!

01:18:40.205 --> 01:18:43.141
The house is gone!

01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:49.012
It's okay, captain. I got this one.

01:18:49.014 --> 01:18:52.917
Dean Olivares, you need
some air. Here. Deep breaths.

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.520
Got it? Everything?

01:18:57.522 --> 01:18:59.088
Julia King?

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:00.457
Thank you, good man.

01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:03.429
My pleasure. Good day to you, Sir.

01:19:04.863 --> 01:19:06.497
Hello, there. Hi.

01:19:06.499 --> 01:19:08.032
Could you tell us about
what happened here today?

01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:09.400
I...

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:19.843
<i>Baby and baby...</i>

01:19:19.845 --> 01:19:21.412
<i>Hey, baby. Hey, baby.</i>

01:19:21.414 --> 01:19:24.282
Hey, Wait. Where's Thad?

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.854
He, uh, he didn't make it.

01:19:29.856 --> 01:19:31.288
So sad!

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:33.324
At least he went out the way he wanted to.

01:19:33.326 --> 01:19:34.557
Partying like a mother fucker,

01:19:34.559 --> 01:19:35.626
ain't nothin' wrong with that.

01:19:35.628 --> 01:19:37.194
Blaze of glory.

01:19:37.196 --> 01:19:39.296
The man was a hero.

01:19:39.298 --> 01:19:41.398
He was a legend.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.967
To Thad!

01:19:43.969 --> 01:19:45.570
To Thad!

01:20:50.568 --> 01:20:53.069
Then why can't I taste any?

01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:54.471
You telling me there's lime in this,

01:20:54.473 --> 01:20:56.239
I can't taste a goddamn ounce of it!

01:20:56.241 --> 01:20:58.175
Now get back there!

01:20:58.177 --> 01:21:00.043
You go back there and
you tell that bartender,

01:21:00.045 --> 01:21:02.145
I need lime in all my mojitos!

01:21:02.147 --> 01:21:04.480
Go! Run!

01:21:04.482 --> 01:21:07.484
Oh, wait. Wait, never mind!

01:21:07.486 --> 01:21:09.720
I can taste the lime now!

01:21:09.722 --> 01:21:12.523
It was hidden under all the mint!

01:21:12.525 --> 01:21:15.294
Come back, I can taste it!

01:22:38.443 --> 01:22:40.610
Sammy!

01:22:40.612 --> 01:22:42.346
Sammy, wake up. Come
on, man. Come back to me.

01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:44.648
Sammy, come on, buddy. Wake up!

01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:46.050
Dick Dawg?

01:22:46.052 --> 01:22:48.651
It's me, pal. Yeah, you're gonna be okay.

01:22:48.653 --> 01:22:50.520
Were you saying my name before?

01:22:50.522 --> 01:22:53.657
What? No. No. Nope.

01:22:53.659 --> 01:22:56.459
You did. You said Sammy.

01:22:56.461 --> 01:22:58.494
Whatever you say, Chief.

01:22:58.496 --> 01:23:00.530
No. Sammy.

01:23:00.532 --> 01:23:03.367
- You said Sammy.
- You're okay, sport. All right?

01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:04.767
Just lay back down, bucko.

01:23:04.769 --> 01:23:08.204
- Say Sammy. Say Sammy.
- Shh!

01:23:08.206 --> 01:23:10.541
You said Sammy. I fucking heard you.

01:23:10.543 --> 01:23:11.608
You're gonna be okay, Tiger.

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:13.577
Sammy!

01:23:13.579 --> 01:23:15.279
- Sammy.
- I'm not actually saying it.

01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:18.181
- You said Sammy!
- That's just you moving my lips.

01:23:18.183 --> 01:23:20.617
Dick Dawg, say it, you
fucking piece of shit.

01:23:20.619 --> 01:23:22.218
You inhaled a little too much shit fumes.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.490
You fucking asshole!
