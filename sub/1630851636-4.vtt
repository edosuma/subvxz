WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:05.266
[phone ringing] Previously onBull...

00:05.309 --> 00:07.398
Where's my daughter?SHERYL: It's hell when someone

00:07.442 --> 00:09.487
takes your child from you.BULL: They nearly took

00:09.531 --> 00:11.402
everything from us, didn't they?[phone ringing]

00:11.446 --> 00:12.795
[Astrid crying]

00:12.838 --> 00:14.231
Oh, no. Where's Astrid?I don't know!

00:14.275 --> 00:15.493
[crying]:
He took her.

00:15.537 --> 00:16.712
He had a gun!

00:16.755 --> 00:19.454
[ringing stops]I need a minute.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.934
Bull?

00:27.592 --> 00:29.681
Tess, don't forget to come home

00:29.725 --> 00:31.683
right after school
on Wednesday, okay?

00:31.727 --> 00:34.947
That college counselor
will be here at 3:30

00:34.991 --> 00:37.080
for your follow-up. Tess?[rock music playing faintly]

00:37.124 --> 00:38.864
Tess.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.780
Hey, Sophia.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.086
Sophia.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.219
[Sophia sighs]

00:48.222 --> 00:49.745
We have a problem.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.747
This was plugged in
behind the dryer.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.096
I think Tess is vaping.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.315
You want to talk to her
or should I?

00:56.665 --> 00:58.928
Actually...
[sighs]

01:00.277 --> 01:02.801
[sighs]
It's mine.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.803
Sophia, seriously?

01:04.847 --> 01:06.675
Don't look at me like that.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.808
All that crap with my sister
and that damn bathroom remodel?

01:09.852 --> 01:11.071
We had a deal.I know.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.159
I know.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.252
You're right.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.254
It's going in the trash.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.038
[whispers]: Okay?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.715
[explosion in distance][glass breaks]

01:46.758 --> 01:48.934
[alarm beeping]

01:52.199 --> 01:53.678
Sophia!

01:54.636 --> 01:56.333
Sophia!

01:59.771 --> 02:01.251
What happened?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
[screams]

02:06.169 --> 02:08.737
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

02:08.780 --> 02:11.870
Mom. Mom!

02:15.787 --> 02:17.746
DETTMER:
When the Smokestack vape pen

02:17.789 --> 02:19.878
that Sophia Echols was smoking
overheated,

02:19.922 --> 02:22.838
it exploded,
sending metal and plastic shards

02:22.881 --> 02:26.842
into her right hand,
neck, mouth and face.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.191
CHUNK:
And these injuries--

02:28.235 --> 02:30.062
they caused Sophia's death?

02:30.106 --> 02:32.369
DETTMER:The ejected materials
penetrated the floor

02:32.413 --> 02:33.718
of her mouth and
went into her neck,

02:33.762 --> 02:35.459
dissecting both
the carotid artery

02:35.503 --> 02:37.200
and internal jugular vein.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.897
She bled to death in minutes.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.944
Dr. Dettmer,
were Sophia's injuries

02:41.987 --> 02:43.902
consistent with those suffered

02:43.946 --> 02:45.556
by the other 146

02:45.600 --> 02:47.558
plaintiff-victims
of this class action?

02:47.602 --> 02:50.126
The nature of the injuries
was quite similar.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.215
They just differed
in degree.And how is that?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.130
DETTMER:Sophia's injuries
were the most extreme,

02:54.174 --> 02:55.479
hers being the
only fatality.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.872
But across the board,

02:56.915 --> 02:59.135
we saw burns,
nerve and tissue damage,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.355
lost limbs, lost teeth,

03:01.398 --> 03:02.747
facial disfigurement.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.488
Three victims were blinded.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.968
The ejected shrapnel

03:06.011 --> 03:08.144
was catastrophically
destructive.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.494
Ejected shrapnel?
Doctor, it sounds as if

03:10.538 --> 03:12.844
you're describing
a battlefield wound.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.237
In a way, I am.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.804
In each of these cases,

03:15.847 --> 03:18.198
the Smokestack vape pens
were closer to a grenade

03:18.241 --> 03:19.895
than a recreational device.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.419
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.248
How we doing?

03:25.292 --> 03:27.250
MARISSA:
Green prairie

03:27.294 --> 03:28.686
for miles on this end.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.080
I wouldn't get
too comfortable with that.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.169
Here comes Carole.So,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.953
Dr. Dettmer,

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
if the device was a grenade,

03:37.434 --> 03:39.044
who pulled the pin?

03:39.088 --> 03:41.656
I don't understand
the question.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.093
Sophia Echols ignored

03:44.136 --> 03:45.921
multiple warnings

03:45.964 --> 03:48.576
and used
an unauthorized charger

03:48.619 --> 03:50.578
for the device,
in effect, weaponizing

03:50.621 --> 03:53.450
her own vape pen.
Isn't that right?

03:53.494 --> 03:54.712
I wouldn't put it that way.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.018
CAROLE:
Hmm. I would.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.759
Not a single injury
has occurred

03:57.802 --> 04:01.110
when a Smokestack vape pen
is charged as instructed

04:01.153 --> 04:03.199
with an authorized charger.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.201
Isn't that correct?CHUNK:
Objection. Your Honor,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.376
counsel is testifying.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.812
This clearly falls outside

04:07.856 --> 04:09.814
of the scope
of the witness' expertise.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.686
I withdraw the question,
Your Honor.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.301
[exhales]
Mm-hmm.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.521
No, don't even think about it.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.174
Your mom needs you.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.525
You are exactly where
you need to be right now.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.743
Is that Danny?Yeah.

04:25.787 --> 04:26.918
Uh, is there
anything we can do?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.268
Order in food
to the hospital?

04:28.311 --> 04:29.399
Does she need me
to send her more clothes?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.096
Do you need more clothes?

04:31.140 --> 04:34.404
Okay. Well, hang in there.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.537
We're praying for your mom.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.886
Okay.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.323
How's her mom doing?Still in the ICU.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.803
Danny's hoping she'll
get transferred

04:41.846 --> 04:43.935
to a rehab facility for
stroke victims soon,

04:43.979 --> 04:46.111
but who knows how
long that'll take.[sighs]

04:46.155 --> 04:48.418
I think we need to bring in
a temporary investigator.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.812
I mean, this case is really...The last thing
we need right now

04:50.855 --> 04:52.901
is another person
on the payroll.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.469
I need to talk to you.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.819
Yeah, just give me a second.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.473
Carole Atkins killed
us today in court

04:59.516 --> 05:01.344
with those warnings
against unauthorized chargers.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.824
I'm aware.We need to find a way

05:02.867 --> 05:04.304
to turn those warnings
against Smokestack.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.131
Show they were
wholly insufficient.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.395
Isn't it obvious? They say
if you use the wrong charger,

05:08.438 --> 05:10.266
the vape pen may malfunction.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.268
They don't say
it'll blow your damn face off.Right.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.791
We need to prove Smokestack knew

05:13.835 --> 05:15.619
these devices
could blow your damn face off

05:15.663 --> 05:17.099
before they put them
on the market.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.406
I've scoured R & D reports,
internal emails.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.537
So far, zilch.

05:20.581 --> 05:21.625
Well, keep scouring.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.453
We need a smoking gun.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.630
Or a smoking vape pen.
[chuckles] Get it?

05:26.674 --> 05:27.979
'Cause vape...I got it. I got it.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.503
I thought it was funny.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.243
MARISSA:Hello?Hi, there. I'm all yours.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.377
Uh, that's what you said
last week. And yesterday.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.118
There's no escaping now.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.163
Uh, we need to talk money.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.557
What about it?We don't have any.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.472
That sounds a tad hyperbolic.This is

05:42.516 --> 05:43.908
the biggest case
we have ever taken on,

05:43.952 --> 05:45.388
and it's bleeding us dry.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.955
We've already spent
nearly $2 million

05:46.998 --> 05:48.739
for all the medical experts,
engineers,

05:48.783 --> 05:51.002
trauma specialists,

05:51.046 --> 05:52.656
not to mention
the paralegals we hired

05:52.700 --> 05:54.179
just to get through
all the discovery.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.225
And there is no end in sight.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.706
Well, got to go big to win big.Meanwhile,

05:58.749 --> 06:00.403
we are turning away clients

06:00.447 --> 06:03.058
because we don't have
the bandwidth for anything else.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.016
Well, none of that matters when
we get our contingency fee.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.453
Whenever that is.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.324
But I talked to our bank,

06:08.368 --> 06:11.153
and they agreed
to extend our credit line.Problem solved.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.024
No. Problem not solved.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.852
It's only enough to cover
about half our expenses.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.811
Have you read
my proposal yet?

06:16.854 --> 06:19.117
Remember
our bandwidth conversation?It'll bring in money right away.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.076
Best part,
no extra work for you.I'm sorry to interrupt,

06:21.119 --> 06:23.252
but Rebecca Healy is here,

06:23.295 --> 06:25.689
and she's in the
conference room.Not it.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.648
Yes, it. I talked to
her the last time.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.345
I talked to her the
last three times.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.129
Bull, she's demanding
to talk to you.[sighs]

06:31.173 --> 06:33.175
I will talk to her.Uh, no, Bull,

06:33.218 --> 06:34.698
I really need to talk to you
about this proposal.Everything is fine.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.439
I have everything under control.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.616
Hey.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.183
You said
we'd be done by now.I know.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.532
Have our money by now.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.316
I know you're frustrated,
Rebecca.My son

06:44.360 --> 06:46.144
can't wait any longer
for his reconstructive surgery.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.929
I know.
And he shouldn't have to.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.105
This is taking a lot longer
than any of us anticipated.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.194
Smokestack has been
dragging it out, right?Smokestack

06:52.237 --> 06:53.456
already offered to settle.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.892
More than once.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.067
You're the one
dragging this out.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.112
Those were not settlement
payouts.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.418
Not real ones. They were

06:58.461 --> 07:00.071
nuisance payouts
to make us go away.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.769
I am gonna get you

07:01.812 --> 07:04.162
and the rest of the class
so much more.I want out.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.729
Of the class, I mean.

07:05.773 --> 07:06.991
I want to negotiate

07:07.035 --> 07:08.602
my own settlement. Now.Right.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.647
But we already talked about
this. You can't opt out.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.432
The deadline has passed.No.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.651
Yes.No. There has to be a way.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.871
There isn't.
Once we've been certified

07:16.914 --> 07:19.482
a class,
the court sees us as one entity,

07:19.526 --> 07:22.790
and there's no jumping in
or out of one entity.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.749
We just have to have patience
a little while longer.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.403
But I promise you,
we are in the right.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.753
I am gonna get your son
everything he deserves.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.408
But I can't do that if I
don't get back to work,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
and I've got to prep a witness
right now, okay?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.021
So, I will see you
in court tomorrow.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.893
[scoffs]

07:40.590 --> 07:41.852
You lied to me!

07:41.896 --> 07:43.506
Rebecca, I never
lied to you.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.508
You said that Smokestack Labs
would never go to trial.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.944
You said that
you would pick a jury

07:46.988 --> 07:48.990
that would
scare the pants off of them.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.775
I told you...You said that being a part
of this stupid class

07:51.819 --> 07:53.429
was the best thing for my son.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.605
I did. I gave you
my word. And...Your word

07:55.649 --> 07:57.477
means nothing.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.224
Everything's
under control, hmm?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.493
♪

08:20.978 --> 08:22.153
CHUNK:
Should be able to get through

08:22.197 --> 08:23.590
the last of our
witnesses today.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
That is, unless Taylor
has found a rabbit

08:25.113 --> 08:27.768
for me to pull
out of my hat.Not yet.

08:27.811 --> 08:31.206
Oh. Well, you got to hand
it to Carole. Pretty smart,

08:31.249 --> 08:33.774
having Mrs. Clayton here
every day by her husband's side.

08:33.817 --> 08:37.386
'Cause he's not
the big, bad CEO of a

08:37.429 --> 08:39.170
evil corporation,
but a president

08:39.214 --> 08:41.608
of a nice, friendly,
family business.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.131
I might be mistaken,
but it seems to me

08:43.174 --> 08:44.567
like you admire Carole.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.221
Well, you don't have
to like a hurricane

08:46.264 --> 08:48.528
to appreciate
its ferocity.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.530
Well, heads up. Hurricane Carole

08:50.573 --> 08:51.922
looks to be
making landfall.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.315
Think she's got
another offer for us?

08:53.358 --> 08:54.969
Either that
or it's the first chapter

08:55.012 --> 08:56.840
of her memoirs. I don't know
which would be worse.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.450
[chuckles]CAROLE: Gentlemen.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.713
BULL: Good morning,

08:59.756 --> 09:01.062
Carole.I think we're beyond that,

09:01.105 --> 09:03.412
don't you?
How about we wrap this up

09:03.455 --> 09:04.979
and take the day off.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.114
I'm looking for a punch
line, but I can't...

09:10.158 --> 09:11.463
Oh, wait, there it is.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.770
$9 million.
You can't be serious.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.337
CHUNK: We have 147

09:15.380 --> 09:17.208
seriously injured victims.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.036
One of them is dead.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.691
My clients included
seven warning labels

09:21.735 --> 09:23.475
on their devices and packaging.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.129
Well beyond industry standards.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.609
What else could they have done?

09:26.653 --> 09:28.132
I don't know. For starters,

09:28.176 --> 09:29.699
maybe sell a product
that doesn't kill people?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.527
Mr. Palmer,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.529
you're new
to the class action game,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.575
but Bull and I have been
around the block

09:35.618 --> 09:37.620
more times
than we would like to admit,

09:37.664 --> 09:40.667
and we both know how expensive
it is to try these cases.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.495
My guess
is that TAC is starting

09:43.539 --> 09:45.367
to feel the bite.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.151
Put yourself out of your misery.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.936
Take the offer.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.155
You know, I think you and I
went to different charm schools,

09:51.199 --> 09:52.679
'cause that wouldn't have been
my approach.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.419
But I

09:54.463 --> 09:56.944
have an eye for juries,
and I like this one.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.251
All I need is one juror.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.950
One juror on my side,

10:02.993 --> 10:05.430
and I hang the whole damn thing.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.954
And then guess what?

10:06.997 --> 10:10.174
We do this whole thing
all over again.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.700
You pay more experts,
more court fees,

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
not to mention
more time down the drain.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.443
No one's hanging my jury.Can you afford to find out?

10:18.487 --> 10:21.708
I'm racking up billable hours
no matter what. You--

10:21.751 --> 10:23.535
you are on contingency.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.060
You lose, you get nothing.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.758
Think about it.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.501
So?There's nothing
to think about.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.638
PATRICK: We quit smoking
over two years ago.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.119
One day, I came home
from work, and...

10:42.163 --> 10:44.905
Sophia was looking
out the back window at Tess.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.865
She was growing up so fast.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.912
And Sophia, she wanted
to be around for all of it.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.478
Tess' marriage.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.089
When she had children.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.439
And that's when we quit.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.354
CHUNK:
But she didn't quit, did she?

10:59.397 --> 11:00.964
She started vaping,

11:01.008 --> 11:03.314
using the Smokestack vape pen.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.620
Isn't that right?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.578
PATRICK:
She slipped. I-It happens.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.668
I'm sure she'd have preferred
a cigarette.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.844
I-I'm positive she chose to vape

11:10.887 --> 11:12.323
because she thought
it was safer.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.760
But it wasn't safer, was it?

11:15.762 --> 11:18.460
No. It wasn't.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.854
It killed her.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.858
No further questions,
Your Honor.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.689
CAROLE:
Mr. Echols,

11:29.732 --> 11:32.169
do you recognize these?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.607
Yeah, they're chargers
from our home.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.697
Correct. This

11:37.740 --> 11:40.743
is the authorized
Smokestack Labs charger

11:40.787 --> 11:43.833
that came with your wife's
vape pen, and this

11:43.877 --> 11:46.706
is your daughter's
phone charger.

11:46.749 --> 11:50.710
And which of these
was plugged into the vape pen

11:50.753 --> 11:53.103
that malfunctioned
on the day of your wife's death?

11:53.147 --> 11:54.975
The white one.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.455
Let the record reflect
that the plaintiff

11:57.499 --> 12:00.197
indicated the nonauthorized

12:00.241 --> 12:02.243
third-party phone charger.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.766
Can you read

12:03.810 --> 12:05.115
the warning label

12:05.159 --> 12:07.944
on the authorized charger,
please?

12:08.902 --> 12:11.295
"Warning:
use of third-party charger

12:11.339 --> 12:13.602
may result
in device malfunction."

12:13.645 --> 12:15.256
CAROLE:
Pretty clear.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.433
But your wife chose to
ignore it, didn't she?

12:18.476 --> 12:20.957
I don't think Sophia
chose to ignore anything.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.829
Are you suggesting
that someone else

12:22.872 --> 12:24.656
used an unauthorized charger

12:24.700 --> 12:26.702
to charge your wife's vape pen?PATRICK: No.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.443
That's not what I'm saying.BULL: Come on,

12:28.486 --> 12:30.358
Patrick. Take control of this.CAROLE: The fact is

12:30.401 --> 12:34.318
your wife used
an unauthorized charger

12:34.362 --> 12:37.278
despite being warned not to do

12:37.321 --> 12:39.454
that very thing.
Isn't that right?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.195
The world is full
of warnings.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.762
CAROLE:
I am not asking

12:42.805 --> 12:44.459
about the world, Mr. Echols.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.243
Just these chargers.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.898
Every time you get gas,
there are warnings on the pump.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.421
But you still pump gas,
don't you?

12:50.465 --> 12:51.683
Here we go.CAROLE: I am asking

12:51.727 --> 12:52.641
the questions, sir.Do you deserve

12:52.684 --> 12:53.860
to die for pumping gas?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.122
Your Honor, please, instruct

12:55.165 --> 12:56.471
the witness...PATRICK: No, my wife

12:56.514 --> 12:57.777
didn't deserve to die
for ignoring

12:57.820 --> 12:59.822
one stupid warning.Mr. Echols.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.606
Your vape pens have
all sorts of warnings

13:01.650 --> 13:03.086
about the dangers
of nicotine.Mr. Echols.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.522
Mr. Echols.But you count on
your customers

13:04.566 --> 13:05.610
to ignore those
warnings, don't you?!

13:05.654 --> 13:07.351
Mr. Echols, enough.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.700
You will restrict

13:08.744 --> 13:10.659
your testimony
to the questions asked.

13:10.702 --> 13:11.747
And now he can.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
[grunts softly]

13:16.360 --> 13:18.623
Uh-oh.What?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.147
Marissa, remind me how pregnant

13:20.190 --> 13:22.410
juror number five is again.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.891
32 weeks and counting. Why?

13:24.934 --> 13:27.197
[sighs] Well, let's just hope
she can keep the rocket

13:27.241 --> 13:29.286
on the launchpad a
little while longer.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.897
The alternate juror

13:30.940 --> 13:33.377
is not be our friend.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.858
Hey, Chunk.Hey.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.468
I think I may have found
a new witness for you.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.818
Who?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.081
Follow me.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.605
All right.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.303
This guy. Dennis LaBrie.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.045
Former Smokestack Labs engineer.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.046
Worked in the
charger division.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.221
If anybody can tell us

13:51.265 --> 13:52.309
what Smokestack knew

13:52.353 --> 13:53.484
about their chargers,

13:53.528 --> 13:54.659
Dennis is the one.

13:54.703 --> 13:55.835
Why him?

13:55.878 --> 13:58.272
I found an archived copy

13:58.315 --> 13:59.664
of Smokestack's website.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.275
This is their
engineering staff chart.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.493
See Dennis there?Sure.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.930
Mm-hmm.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.237
This is the web page
they have up now.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.157
Notice anything?Yeah,

14:14.201 --> 14:15.637
your engineer's gone.Wiped clean

14:15.680 --> 14:16.899
from their site just two days

14:16.943 --> 14:18.509
after the class action
was filed.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.077
Okay, well, maybe he just
went and got a new job.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.384
Maybe it's just a coincidence.Mm, could be.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.213
But in the thousands of pages
of discovery documents

14:26.256 --> 14:28.911
Smokestack sent over,
he's nowhere.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.696
He's not listed in a
single R & D report

14:31.740 --> 14:32.915
even though he was on the team

14:32.959 --> 14:34.395
when the charger research
was done.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.136
So, looks like Smokestack went
out of their way

14:36.179 --> 14:37.441
to make him disappear.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.008
That's what I've been saying.Okay.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.488
Well, it sounds
like you need to go find him.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.924
You need to get him
to talk to us,

14:41.968 --> 14:43.883
and you need to do it fast.[chuckles]

14:43.926 --> 14:45.232
That part's
usually more of a Danny thing.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.103
Yeah. But, uh,
unless he's in a hospital

14:47.147 --> 14:48.713
in Florida,

14:48.757 --> 14:50.672
it sounds like it's got to be
a Taylor thing.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.196
Okay.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.808
I spoke to Louis,
the marshal in the courtroom.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.462
He said that juror number five

14:58.506 --> 15:01.030
asked him for an antacid.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.554
So, thankfully,
no premature labor.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.948
Just good,
old-fashioned indigestion.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.037
Thank God. Our
alternate juror

15:08.081 --> 15:10.213
is a real "do not
pass go" situation.Yeah.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.302
But you-- nice work

15:12.346 --> 15:14.043
today, Counselor.[chuckles]

15:14.087 --> 15:16.524
Patrick's testimony
was very impactful.Thank you.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.395
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
It was a good day.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.310
Have a few more days like this,
and we may just meet

15:20.354 --> 15:22.617
that contingency threshold
after all.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.619
Uh, what threshold?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.143
Bull didn't tell you?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.845
There is a
contingency threshold?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.586
Doesn't anyone
say hello anymore?

15:35.630 --> 15:39.068
We have to win over
$50 million in damages,

15:39.112 --> 15:40.548
or we get nothing.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.158
Not nothing. Five percent.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.769
Uh, that's
practically nothing.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.990
Compared to 33% like a
normal contingency case,

15:48.034 --> 15:50.253
which I thought
we were getting.Well, plaintiffs started

15:50.297 --> 15:52.908
to look at other representation.
I had to sweeten the pot.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.346
Sweetening the pot is lowering
our fee to 25% or 20%, not five.Well,

15:56.390 --> 15:59.436
the agreements are signed.
There is nothing we can do now.Okay.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.047
Well,
given the financial situation,

16:01.090 --> 16:03.658
I really think we need to talk
about my proposal.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.094
This isn't the best time.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.053
We have
this great predictive algorithm

16:07.096 --> 16:08.619
to analyze jury behavior.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.621
No one else
has anything like it.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.319
We can lease it out
to other firms,

16:12.362 --> 16:14.669
and I'll still be running
the analytics from TAC.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.324
You want to rent out
the algorithm?To bring in revenue,

16:17.367 --> 16:19.065
shore up our finances, yes.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.196
Winning the case

16:20.240 --> 16:22.024
is gonna shore up
our finances.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.808
I can't do this right now.
We got to put

16:23.852 --> 16:25.810
the CEO of Smokestack
on the stand tomorrow.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.030
Chunk and I
are preparing his cross.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.945
You bet the farm, Bull.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.381
For all of us.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.469
And it never even crossed
your mind

16:32.513 --> 16:33.688
to talk to us about it.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.124
Talk to me.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.647
My mistake. I didn't realize

16:36.691 --> 16:38.040
I had to run
all my business decisions

16:38.084 --> 16:40.651
past you. You're still
getting paid, right?

16:40.695 --> 16:42.392
You know that's not the point.Oh,

16:42.436 --> 16:43.785
it is exactly the point.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.656
Everybody's getting paid,

16:45.700 --> 16:48.616
and I'm the only one
with anything to worry about.Yeah,

16:48.659 --> 16:51.010
my mistake. I thought
we were all in this together.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.359
[door closes]

17:01.716 --> 17:03.674
IZZY:
It's 4:00 in the morning.

17:03.718 --> 17:07.156
That explains the whole
"sun not being up" thing.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.246
[sighs] I swear you're becoming
a worse sleeper than Astrid.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.380
And I cry more,
but I'm working on that part.[chuckles]

17:15.382 --> 17:17.688
Is that TAC's
balance sheet?

17:17.732 --> 17:19.908
Unfortunately, yeah.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
Well, I've seen
enough of those

17:21.736 --> 17:23.738
to know that that much
red is not a good thing.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.175
[breathes deeply]
I know.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.568
Marissa warned me.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.309
I've just been so busy.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.529
I didn't want to believe
it was that bad.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.663
Are we talking "pack up the
car and move to Mexico" bad?

17:35.706 --> 17:39.406
No. Although that is not
a bad plan B.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.887
I'm just gonna have
to take money

17:42.931 --> 17:44.889
out of my personal account,
put it into TAC

17:44.933 --> 17:46.195
until this case resolves.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.980
Uh, okay...
[sighs]

17:49.024 --> 17:50.678
I'm not gonna touch
our retirement accounts

17:50.721 --> 17:52.158
or Astrid's education.
It's just...

17:52.201 --> 17:53.811
Or my money?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.074
[chuckles]:
Or your money.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.858
Of course.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.905
You know why
you're doing this,

18:00.949 --> 18:02.081
right?

18:02.124 --> 18:04.561
Taking on
one of the biggest cases

18:04.605 --> 18:05.910
of your career?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.477
Because it's
a game-changing payday

18:07.521 --> 18:09.000
when we win.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.611
No.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.004
It's not about the money
for you. It's about the win.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.398
You know, it's only been

18:15.442 --> 18:16.921
a few months
since Astrid was kidnapped,

18:16.965 --> 18:21.012
and that knocked us both
for a loop.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.102
I'm past all that.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.016
I know.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.193
It's just that when you're used
to being king of the mountain

18:27.236 --> 18:28.933
and you get knocked down,
sometimes you look

18:28.977 --> 18:30.631
for the biggest, baddest bear
to wrestle

18:30.674 --> 18:32.459
just to prove
that you're on top.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.156
I do like the idea

18:34.200 --> 18:35.853
of me wrestling a bear
on top of a mountain,

18:35.897 --> 18:39.770
but that's not
what this is about.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.512
This is about helping people.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.734
Hmm.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.129
I'm gonna go back to bed.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.261
Okay.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.741
You know,

18:53.784 --> 18:55.482
just be careful, babe.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.094
Sometimes the bear wins.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.366
You know what a
chop block is?

19:10.410 --> 19:12.368
Some kind of football thing?Yeah.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.109
When you hit a guy in the
legs and someone else comes

19:14.153 --> 19:16.416
and hits him up top. Tear
him apart, basically.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.506
Mm.You know what I'm gonna do to
Smokestack's CEO on cross today?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.116
Chop block him.[chuckles]

19:21.160 --> 19:23.423
And love every
minute of it.Excuse me.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.947
Well, keep talking like that,
we might win this thing.Yeah.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.557
HOPKINS:
Mr. Palmer,

19:27.601 --> 19:30.647
Dr. Bull, a word.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.652
Something tells me this isn't
gonna be a friendly chat.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.788
Ms. Atkins and I

19:40.831 --> 19:43.660
were just having
a fascinating conversation.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.923
One of your plaintiffs,
Rebecca Healy,

19:45.967 --> 19:47.490
called Ms. Atkins
last night

19:47.534 --> 19:50.798
and attempted to negotiate
her own settlement.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.061
We...

19:53.104 --> 19:54.976
We apologize, Your Honor.Oh, oh, oh,

19:55.019 --> 19:56.543
it gets better.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.241
When Ms. Atkins explained
that as defense counsel,

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
she was barred from speaking
to a member of the class,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.941
do you know
what your client did next?

20:03.985 --> 20:07.902
She ambushed me
outside my chambers

20:07.945 --> 20:09.251
as I arrived this morning

20:09.295 --> 20:10.992
asking to be excused
from the class

20:11.035 --> 20:13.690
because her concerns
are being ignored.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.214
And according to Ms. Healy,

20:15.257 --> 20:16.867
she's not the only one
who feels this way.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.826
Your Honor, we've spoken
with Ms. Healy multiple times

20:18.869 --> 20:20.697
about how class action
litigation works.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.482
At the class
certification hearing,

20:22.525 --> 20:24.397
you two assured me

20:24.440 --> 20:26.616
the victims
were all in the same boat,

20:26.660 --> 20:28.792
unified in what they wanted.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.229
But from what I'm seeing,

20:30.272 --> 20:33.232
no one's rowing
in the same direction.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.061
Get your clients under control,

20:37.105 --> 20:39.281
or I will decertify this class.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.023
Am I understood?Absolutely, Your Honor.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.291
BULL:
I know you're frustrated.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814
You want results.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.295
The process is slow,
and I get it.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.123
But you cannot
talk to the judge.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.777
You can't talk
to the defense attorney.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.301
I had to talk to someone.
You won't listen to me.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.522
Do you know what happens if the
judge decertifies this class?

21:02.565 --> 21:05.655
He'll declare a mistrial,
and it all starts over.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.962
Good. I can negotiate
my own settlement.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.616
No.It might not be
as much money,

21:09.659 --> 21:10.878
but at least I'll
get it faster.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.880
Get my son his
surgery faster.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.316
That is not true, Rebecca.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.840
A mistrial means
you have to get a new attorney.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.233
You have to go through

21:18.277 --> 21:19.669
discovery again.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.018
They're not just gonna
write you a check.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.019
It's not how it works.I'm just trying

21:22.063 --> 21:23.238
to get my son his surgery.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.022
I know.No, you don't.

21:25.066 --> 21:28.199
Do you know why I had to
ask you to meet me outside?

21:28.243 --> 21:30.680
Ronnie won't let me bring
anyone up to the apartment.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.334
He's too ashamed.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.944
He doesn't want anyone
to see him.[exhales]

21:33.988 --> 21:36.686
When the vape pen exploded...

21:40.995 --> 21:43.693
The damage it did to his face...

21:47.001 --> 21:48.437
[clears throat]

21:48.481 --> 21:50.309
He won't go to school.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.441
He hasn't left the
apartment in months.

21:52.485 --> 21:53.877
He's afraid

21:53.921 --> 21:55.444
of what people are gonna say
about him.

21:56.663 --> 21:59.405
Do you have any idea

21:59.448 --> 22:02.408
what it's like to watch
your child be hurt like that?

22:03.757 --> 22:06.455
And be helpless
to do anything?

22:07.587 --> 22:09.893
It's just the two of you, huh?

22:09.937 --> 22:11.765
You and Ronnie.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.987
That's a lot of pressure.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.862
I want to help you
take some of that pressure off.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.255
You're not alone.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.648
Stick with me

22:25.692 --> 22:29.652
on this. I promise you,
we are gonna win.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.351
[sighs]
We have to win.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.530
TAYLOR:
I need help.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.575
MARISSA:
Wh-What's the matter?I'm not Danny.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.664
Okay, you're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.144
Chunk asked me to track down

22:43.187 --> 22:45.015
this former
Smokestack Labs engineer,

22:45.059 --> 22:46.669
Dennis LaBrie. I called him.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.410
I texted him. I DM'd him.
Radio silence.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.151
I finally found out

22:50.194 --> 22:52.458
he's got a new job as a manager
at a Cable Warriors.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.155
So I came here,

22:54.198 --> 22:55.983
told one of the guys
at the help desk that I bought

22:56.026 --> 22:59.029
a lemon laptop and needed
to speak with the manager,

22:59.073 --> 23:00.553
but it completely backfired.

23:00.596 --> 23:01.728
How?

23:01.771 --> 23:04.034
He offered me a new laptop.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.862
I didn't even buy
my laptop here.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.169
So, I made up some weird excuse
and ran away,

23:08.212 --> 23:10.171
and now I have no idea
how to get to Dennis LaBrie.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.260
Well, you need
to figure it out today.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.783
If we can't call him

23:13.827 --> 23:15.437
as a rebuttal witness tomorrow,
we'll be heading

23:15.481 --> 23:16.917
into closing arguments,
and then it's too late.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.441
Thank you, Marissa.
I wasn't stressed enough.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.704
Yeah. Got it. I'm sorry.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.054
So, uh, okay, you're not Danny.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.752
You're Taylor.
What's Taylor good at?

23:26.753 --> 23:28.711
[sighs]

23:32.846 --> 23:34.804
[alarm blaring]

23:35.805 --> 23:37.372
Mr. LaBrie.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.330
Thank God.
I can't get them to turn off.

23:39.374 --> 23:42.725
For Pete's sake, just...
go back to the help desk.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.473
Dennis LaBrie?Yeah.

23:51.517 --> 23:55.434
Try control, six,
underscore, ampersand.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.654
[blaring stops]

23:58.698 --> 24:00.134
How did you...

24:00.177 --> 24:02.484
Do you need a job?

24:02.528 --> 24:05.487
No. My name is Taylor Rentzel.
I've been

24:05.531 --> 24:07.097
trying to reach you.
I'm working on behalf

24:07.141 --> 24:09.448
of a class of plaintiffs
who are suing Smokestack.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.580
Wait. You did this?

24:11.624 --> 24:13.713
Sorry.
I really needed to talk to you.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.628
You're the lady
who's been calling me

24:15.671 --> 24:17.238
about Smokestack Labs.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.719
Well, you know, I hope

24:19.762 --> 24:21.982
that you take those bastards
to the cleaners.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.245
They fired me
for telling the truth.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.465
Now I'm stuck having to commute
to Jersey every day.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.205
Any chance that truth
had something to do

24:28.249 --> 24:30.251
with how dangerous
the vape pens are?That's right.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.035
I told Clayton himself

24:32.079 --> 24:33.428
that if people used
the wrong charger,

24:33.472 --> 24:34.777
they could get hurt. But no,

24:34.821 --> 24:37.084
he was more interested
in saving a buck.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.869
Clayton. Arnold Clayton,
Smokestack's CEO?

24:39.913 --> 24:42.568
Yes, ma'am.You told him
using unauthorized chargers

24:42.611 --> 24:45.527
was dangerous?I told him
people could get killed.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.660
And this was
before anyone had been hurt?Before the product

24:47.703 --> 24:49.618
even shipped. It was obvious.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.752
I-I can't tell you how helpful
you could be to this case.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.971
Will you testify
about this in court?

24:55.015 --> 24:58.409
Yeah. No, I can't do that.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.848
TAYLOR:
He signed an NDA as part

25:01.891 --> 25:03.371
of his severance agreement,
and Smokestack

25:03.414 --> 25:05.547
wasn't messing around.BULL: How bad is it?

25:05.591 --> 25:09.551
There's a $500,000 penalty
if he breaches the NDA.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.380
Okay. Tell LaBrie we'll cover
the $500,000 if Smokestack

25:12.423 --> 25:14.208
comes after him.We will?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.602
Yeah, we will.
Thanks, Taylor.Bull.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.039
It's gonna look like we're
buying this guy's testimony.

25:19.082 --> 25:22.477
No. We are allowed to pay

25:22.521 --> 25:25.959
for a witness', uh,
expenses, for instance.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.309
And if he gets sued,
that's just an expense.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.746
The expenses exemption
was designed

25:30.790 --> 25:33.575
for things like a hotel room
or a plane ticket.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.838
Now, it may not be
technically unethical,

25:35.882 --> 25:37.144
but we're
skirting the line.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.667
Carole's about
to rest her case,

25:38.711 --> 25:41.017
and we are losing, so
we have to call Dennis

25:41.061 --> 25:44.455
as a rebuttal witness.
It's our best shot.[indistinct radio transmission]

25:46.109 --> 25:47.502
What happened?WOMAN: A delivery guy

25:47.546 --> 25:48.982
on one of those electric bikes

25:49.025 --> 25:50.853
came zipping out of nowhere
and hit some poor man.

25:50.897 --> 25:51.898
No.God,

25:51.941 --> 25:53.073
I hate those things.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.076
[indistinct chatter]

26:03.692 --> 26:05.128
That's one of our jurors.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.652
Wasone.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.871
There's no way he's coming back
today. Or tomorrow.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.134
The alternate
is terrible for us.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.572
Carole just got her one juror.

26:19.447 --> 26:22.232
So...

26:22.276 --> 26:25.627
Apparently, couple of you
thought it was a good idea

26:25.671 --> 26:27.977
to go to a party
the night before a game.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.152
[scoffs]

26:29.196 --> 26:31.372
So I guess the contract
you all signed

26:31.415 --> 26:32.895
doesn't mean a damn thing.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.289
Meet our newest juror,
Coach Randall Hughes.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.812
You think the rules

26:36.856 --> 26:40.337
are just suggestions? Hmm?

26:40.381 --> 26:42.426
Hmm? Playing's a privilege.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.820
You just lost it.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.475
We're forfeiting the game.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.782
[boys sigh]

26:49.825 --> 26:54.003
I said it before,
and I'll say it again.

26:54.047 --> 26:57.616
Actions have consequences.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.444
Fan of bluegrass music.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.316
Despiser of victim culture.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.884
For the last 20 years, he's been
head coach at Tatum High School.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.233
CHUNK:
Think it's safe to say

27:06.276 --> 27:07.321
he's more Bobby Knight

27:07.364 --> 27:08.670
than Ted Lasso.Yeah.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.628
He's all about
following the rules

27:09.671 --> 27:10.846
and paying the price

27:10.890 --> 27:12.326
when you don't.CHUNK: I mean,

27:12.369 --> 27:13.849
he's just one guy.
Maybe the other jurors

27:13.893 --> 27:15.329
can get him to come around.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.547
He doesn't seem

27:16.591 --> 27:17.853
much like a "come around" guy.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.116
BULL:
Well, maybe the key is not

27:20.160 --> 27:22.945
to change his thinking
but embrace it.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.121
Most coaches
don't like cheaters.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.470
No, they don't.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.081
Dennis LaBrie
is about to testify

27:28.124 --> 27:29.691
that Smokestack knew

27:29.735 --> 27:31.954
that their customers
could be seriously injured.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.434
He's proof that they were trying

27:33.477 --> 27:35.175
to cheat their way
out of accountability.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.829
I can say it.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.179
Maybe it'll convince
Coach Hughes.

27:39.222 --> 27:42.269
Hmm. Where's Marissa?
She should be here for this.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.749
I think she's with some
people in the mock courtroom.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.489
What people?

27:46.447 --> 27:49.232
Our software
is a predictive tool

27:49.276 --> 27:51.408
that can help you anticipate
how juries

27:51.452 --> 27:54.542
will react to opening and
closing arguments, witnesses,

27:54.585 --> 27:56.283
evidence, even how

27:56.326 --> 27:58.677
they will decide cases.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.592
We have been using and refining

28:01.636 --> 28:03.551
this algorithm

28:03.594 --> 28:05.205
at TAC for over a decade,

28:05.248 --> 28:07.860
and now we will be making
this tool available to you.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.165
Marissa?

28:09.209 --> 28:10.689
Excuse me?

28:10.732 --> 28:12.168
Everyone, I think you
know Dr. Jason Bull.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.430
Hey there.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.171
Can I borrow you
for just a moment?

28:15.215 --> 28:17.304
I'll be right back.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.351
Excuse me,
I need the room.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.440
Thank you.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.227
What are you doing?

28:27.270 --> 28:28.968
Trying to protect TAC.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.665
Trying to protect you.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.840
The Smokestack case
is a huge gamble.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.102
We need some insurance.

28:33.146 --> 28:34.277
Right now,

28:34.321 --> 28:36.410
this Smokestack case isTAC.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.456
Tomorrow we are putting our most
important witness on the stand.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.371
We have a bum juror in the box.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.025
I need everybody
to stay focused.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.071
And what I don't need is
somebody going behind my back.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.768
I didn't go behind your back.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.509
I've been in front of you
the whole time.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.511
You just refuse to see me.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.208
Well, I see you now.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.167
Get your head in mygame.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.559
'Cause that's the one
we got to win.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.756
Sure. Have a good night.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.540
You're not okay.

29:22.412 --> 29:25.154

29:30.812 --> 29:32.814
Oh, yes and no.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.864
But it isn't. It's mine.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.430

29:40.474 --> 29:41.867
I know.
Everyone knows that.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.390
Do they?

29:43.433 --> 29:45.000
I'm not sure
Bull does, sometimes.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.923
After Benny left,

29:54.967 --> 29:57.621
I thought he would offer me
this office.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.452
But it's been months,
and it just sits here empty.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.715
Bet he never even
thought about it.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.543
You should ask him.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.111
I could. I just...

30:11.548 --> 30:14.290
I thought it was obvious.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.205
I guess he didn't.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.863
Maybe with the kidnapping and...

30:21.907 --> 30:24.561
everything that's
been going on, he just...

30:24.605 --> 30:26.737
Maybe.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.872
Like I said,
I was just having a moment.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.787
Let's get out of here.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.318
CHUNK:
And what was your concern?

30:42.362 --> 30:44.886
DENNIS:
I realized that there was
a design flaw.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.019
If you used
third-party chargers,

30:47.062 --> 30:49.282
the battery could overheat
dramatically.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.154
And what would be the result
of this dramatic overheating?

30:52.198 --> 30:54.591
DENNIS:Well, when the batteries
get too hot, they explode.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.419
So you don't need
to be a genius to know

30:56.463 --> 30:58.334
that people were gonna get hurt.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.988
S-Seriously hurt.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.555
So what did you do?

31:01.598 --> 31:03.687
I took it straight to the top.
I told him.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.169
Let the record reflect

31:07.213 --> 31:08.997
the witness just pointed
to Arnold Clayton,

31:09.041 --> 31:10.912
the CEO of Smokestack Labs.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.349
Now, what exactly did you say
to Mr. Clayton?

31:13.393 --> 31:16.178
Well, I explained
the problem to Mr. Clayton

31:16.222 --> 31:18.050
and I offered
a simple solution.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.791
We could make
a unique charging port

31:20.835 --> 31:23.272
that isn't compatible
to third-party chargers.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.926
Problem solved.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.232
Unique charger port.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.624
W-What's that mean?

31:27.668 --> 31:29.931
Well, the port is
essentially the socket

31:29.975 --> 31:32.803
on your device
where you connect your charger.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.414
Smokestack Labs Vape Pens

31:34.457 --> 31:36.764
are all compatible
with the industry-standard

31:36.807 --> 31:38.244
micro USB chargers.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.811
Micro USBs are used
for pretty much everything.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.901
Phone, camera.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.293
That's why it's so easy

31:44.337 --> 31:46.034
for people
to use the wrong charger.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.949
And so how did Mr. Clayton react

31:47.993 --> 31:49.385
when you proposed making

31:49.429 --> 31:51.039
this unique charger port?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.693
DENNIS:
He shot it down.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.695
Said it would be too expensive

31:54.738 --> 31:56.653
and it would turn off
our customers.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.351
Did he propose
an alternative?

31:58.394 --> 32:00.222
Yeah. A cheaper one.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.485
Adding a battery warning light

32:02.529 --> 32:04.226
to the vape pens, but nobody

32:04.270 --> 32:06.011
pays any attention
to warning lights.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.013
I told him
people could get hurt.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.537
And what happened next?

32:10.580 --> 32:12.539
They fired me.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.673
CHUNK:No further questions,
Your Honor.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.025
What are you seeing on your end?

32:20.068 --> 32:22.505
MARISSA: Dennis' testimony
is definitely landing.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.420
Even with Coach Hughes.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.422
He might just come around
after all.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.815
CAROLE:
Mr. LaBrie,

32:27.858 --> 32:30.644
at this meeting
with Mr. Clayton,

32:30.687 --> 32:34.169
the charger port
was not the only concern

32:34.213 --> 32:36.389
you brought up, was it?I'm not sure.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.086
There was a lot going on.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.307
Let me see if I can
refresh your memory.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.135
Do you remember bringing up

32:43.178 --> 32:45.398
the poor quality
of the toilet paper

32:45.441 --> 32:47.878
in the third-floor bathroom?

32:47.922 --> 32:49.924
DENNIS:
Uh, I don't remember
exactly, but

32:49.968 --> 32:51.665
they were using
very cheap products.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.536
It was a health concern.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.625
Hmm. And the rattling vent

32:55.669 --> 32:58.280
over your work station,

32:58.324 --> 33:01.327
which you described
to Mr. Clayton in some detail?

33:01.370 --> 33:03.677
Was that a health concern, too?Well, it made it

33:03.720 --> 33:05.157
very difficult
to get anything done.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.028
It was affecting
my productivity.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.812
CAROLE:
Right.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.858
And the "illegal"

33:10.901 --> 33:13.426
use of the microwave
for popcorn?

33:13.469 --> 33:15.819
There were signs everywhere,
and that smell--

33:15.863 --> 33:18.126
it permeated everything.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.391
CAROLE:
And after the meeting
with Mr. Clayton,

33:22.435 --> 33:24.959
you followed up
with a call to him

33:25.003 --> 33:28.658
and seven other
top Smokestack executives

33:28.702 --> 33:32.097
to alert them to all these
issues, including--

33:32.140 --> 33:35.535
and I believe
this was your phrase--

33:35.578 --> 33:39.017
the "nefarious"
popcorn situation.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.628
Do I have that right?No.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.457
No, y...
You're making me sound silly.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.982
These were important matters.
These were important matters.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.550
And-and-and the entire
executive team--

33:50.593 --> 33:52.987
they ignored it.
I had to bring it up.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.032
I had to.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.685
I had to.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.906
CAROLE:
Nothing further, Your Honor.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.476
CHUNK:
It would've been nice to know

34:03.519 --> 34:05.695
that Dennis was a crackpot
before we put him on the stand.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.697
MARISSA:Taylor didn't have
enough time to ferret out

34:07.741 --> 34:10.091
anything other than
what he wanted us to know.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.442
We all knew he was a Hail Mary.

34:13.486 --> 34:16.097
And Hail Marys
usually fail.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.359
Unfortunately,
Dennis' testimony

34:17.403 --> 34:19.013
isn't our only problem.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.797
Everyone's favorite juror,
Coach Randall Hughes,

34:20.841 --> 34:22.103
is a natural leader.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.018
He may even end up
as the jury foreman.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.411
He could spread the red.

34:25.454 --> 34:26.499
Great.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.196
So now Carole

34:28.240 --> 34:29.850
may not just hang the jury,

34:29.893 --> 34:31.765
she may win
the whole thing.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.375
We still have one shot:
your closing.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.334

on a couple different versions.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.900

are downstairs waiting.

they're ready.

34:42.602 --> 34:43.864

34:45.257 --> 34:46.519
Send the mirror jurors home.

34:46.562 --> 34:49.087
You both should go home, too.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.175
You don't want
to test the closing?

34:50.218 --> 34:52.481
No. We've all been working hard.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.570
I think the most important thing
is to get some rest.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.833
