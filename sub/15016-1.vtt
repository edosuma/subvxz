00:27.300 --> 00:28.600
Be still!

02:23.700 --> 02:24.800
Princess Pink.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.300
Princess Pink.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.000
Such a good little boy...

04:08.200 --> 04:09.500
That's right...

04:10.300 --> 04:12.300
That's a good boy, Bubby...

04:15.000 --> 04:16.200
Good boy...

04:22.300 --> 04:23.500
Good little boy...

04:27.800 --> 04:28.500
Toilet...?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.100
Don't move!

04:31.700 --> 04:33.400
Jesus can see everything.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.700
He tells me you moved,
by Christ, I'll beat you brainless!

04:54.900 --> 04:55.800
Be still!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Bubby naughty...

07:01.500 --> 07:02.800
Oh, Christ!

07:03.900 --> 07:05.000
What you done?!

07:06.700 --> 07:09.100
You... filthy little cunt!

07:09.600 --> 07:11.400
You dirty little shit!

07:12.700 --> 07:14.700
I'll send you to hell,
just you see,

07:14.700 --> 07:16.700
you'll go to hell,
and your eyes will fall out,

07:16.800 --> 07:19.100
and your prick will fall off,
you dirty little SLIME!

07:32.100 --> 07:34.400
You're such a good little boy...

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
Mummy does love
her little Bubby...

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
You like'em, don't you, Bub...

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
Beautiful, ain't they?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.100
Good little boy...

07:59.700 --> 08:00.800
Be still!

08:02.900 --> 08:03.900

08:04.100 --> 08:05.400

08:11.300 --> 08:12.600
Can't come outside,

08:12.600 --> 08:13.900

08:15.300 --> 08:16.600
And Bubby DIE!

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
Now be still!

08:46.100 --> 08:47.100
Poison!

08:48.800 --> 08:49.200
Poison!

08:49.200 --> 08:50.600
If the poison don't get you?

08:51.600 --> 08:52.500
Then God will.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.200
Don't you bloody forget it.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.800
Don't you bloody forget it!

09:11.900 --> 09:13.000
Where Kat from?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.200
Outside.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.400
How come he ain't...

09:29.900 --> 09:31.100
...no gas-mask?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.100
Don't need it.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.600
Don't breathe.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.600
How don't breathe?

10:29.800 --> 10:31.400
That... ain't breathin'.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.100
Eat!

12:50.700 --> 12:52.600
I know you're in there, Florence!

12:57.500 --> 12:58.900
I'll be back!

13:19.400 --> 13:21.300
What?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.900
Want to go out, do you?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.000
Want to go out to see
what it's like, do you?!

13:26.100 --> 13:27.200
Want to go outside?!

13:27.800 --> 13:30.000
Cough, choke?!

13:30.100 --> 13:31.200
DIE?!

13:49.500 --> 13:51.800
I know, you're in there, Florence!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.300
I'll be back!

14:09.300 --> 14:10.500
Bubby a good little boy.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.900
Mummy's little boy.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.500
Shut up!

14:39.400 --> 14:40.800
Don't be disgusting!

15:25.100 --> 15:26.400
Anybody there?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.100
Come on!

15:30.200 --> 15:31.700
I know you're in there!

15:38.200 --> 15:40.200
Go away!

15:40.300 --> 15:43.100
Florence? Open up or
I'll bust the door down!

15:44.400 --> 15:45.700
I know it's you!

15:46.300 --> 15:48.000
I've seen you come and go!

16:30.700 --> 16:33.100
That's funny... That's funny...!

16:33.300 --> 16:35.700
All these years and
I didn't know I had a son!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.100
Not so funny.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.800
Christ, Florence! You've got
to see the funny side of things!

16:43.700 --> 16:47.200
I've been waiting for you
35 years here to come back.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.900
Yes... well...

16:53.900 --> 16:55.600
I meant to come back
sooner, didn't I?

16:56.600 --> 16:57.700
Just...

16:57.800 --> 16:59.800
Well, just I didn't get
round to it before.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.900
I'm here now, ain't I?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yes...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.200
Yes, you are...

17:07.300 --> 17:08.400
You're here now.

17:09.599 --> 17:10.500
God...

17:10.599 --> 17:13.200
Thirty-five years...
Gone quick!

17:14.200 --> 17:16.300
You still look good, Flo.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.300
You always were
a good-looking broad!

17:20.900 --> 17:22.700
You always were the charmer...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.200
Yep.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.700
Charmed a few girls in my time.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.800
And yet I never knowed I had a son!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.900
Good, healthy-looking specimen, too.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.300
You done well, Flo.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.800
Hey, son!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.500
You can call me Pop!

17:42.400 --> 17:43.500
I'm your Pop!

17:48.400 --> 17:49.500
Pop.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.800
Pop.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.800
He's gettin' the idea.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.500
Pop.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.200
Pop-pop-pop...

18:01.100 --> 18:02.100
Pop.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.100
- Pop-pop-pop-pop...
- Yeah, yeah...

18:04.100 --> 18:06.400
Alright, don't go making
a big thing of it.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.600
Listen, Flo.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.700
I know I should have been back
sooner and I'm sorry and all that.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.400
But do you reckon, you know...

18:17.100 --> 18:18.500
You and me...

18:19.100 --> 18:20.100
You know...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.600
Will you still have me, Flo?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.900
I don't know.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.900
You bein' a man of God now...

18:32.100 --> 18:33.100
Oh, that...

18:33.700 --> 18:35.700
Did a bit of preaching
part-time, nothing in it.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.300
How about it, then?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.400
Make an honest women of you!

18:42.500 --> 18:44.100
Don't know if I can
trust you, Harold.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.300
Hey, what's up, son? You got
a mental condition or something?

18:55.700 --> 18:58.100
If you and me are gonna learn
to live together...

18:59.100 --> 19:00.800
...we gotta have some respect!

19:01.500 --> 19:02.500
Comprendez?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.600
I think he comprends.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.400
How about some refreshment, love?

19:11.500 --> 19:12.700
Sorry, Harold.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.400
Hey, son!

19:33.100 --> 19:35.700
Me and your mother
would like to have a bit of a talk.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.300
How about going outside?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
Bubby ain't used to going outside.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.900
By himself...

19:43.500 --> 19:45.600
Son, you ain't a poofter, are you?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.900
I don't want any son of mine
growing up to be a... homosexual.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.100
I'd disown him first.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.400
You got to try to understand...

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Me and Bubby...

19:57.700 --> 20:01.500
We been here... hm...
by ourselves a long time.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.200
But he ain't like other kids.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.200
He was such a difficult birth.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.400
All alone in here,
no one to help you...

20:14.200 --> 20:15.700
I didn't think
I'd pull through.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.500
So you gotta try to understand.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.600
As long as he ain't a poofter.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.200
Oh, no. No, he ain't.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.800
Dry old conversation, Flo!

20:29.900 --> 20:30.900
Pardon?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.200
Dry old conversation!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.300
Oh, sorry!

20:36.500 --> 20:38.100
We don't get very many visitors!

20:38.700 --> 20:40.100
Hm, would a sherry do?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.600
Any port in the storm...!

20:43.400 --> 20:44.900
Any port in the storm...

20:58.400 --> 21:00.500
I can see right down
your dress, Flo.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.700
God, you've got great tits!

21:04.400 --> 21:05.800
They were big before,

21:05.900 --> 21:07.600
but now they're great
big whoppers of things!

21:07.700 --> 21:09.600
You're just being nice!

21:09.800 --> 21:11.100
No, seriously, Flo.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.200
They're the sort of tits
a man can really lose himself in.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.100
Bury his face and forget
about the troubles of-

21:21.000 --> 21:22.300
What troubles, Harold?

21:25.100 --> 21:26.300
What troubles can a man forget?

21:29.500 --> 21:31.400
Let go, Bubby, let go!

21:32.300 --> 21:33.600
Jesus...! He's mad!

21:34.200 --> 21:35.600
The fucking bastard!

21:36.100 --> 21:37.100
Harold! Harold, it's...

21:37.300 --> 21:40.200
- He was trying to kill me! - He was not!
- You mad, you bastard!

21:40.400 --> 21:41.600
He didn't mean you any harm,

21:41.700 --> 21:44.200
he was just trying to see
whether you breathed or not.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.300
What?!

21:45.300 --> 21:47.500
It's not his fault, he's got
some strange ideas.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.500
You can't blame the kid.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.600
He can't help it.
He never had a father.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.400
Nearly killed the
only one he's got.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.300
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

21:58.400 --> 21:59.600
Weirdo.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.000
Christ, kid. You're a weirdo.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.800
Christ, kid.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.200
You're a weirdo!

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
You've got lovely skin, Flo.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.800
Soft, and sexy.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.500
You're a sexy woman.

22:19.700 --> 22:20.700
You make it hard

22:20.800 --> 22:24.100
for a red-blooded man
to keep his hands off you.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.100
You have lovely hands, Harold.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.000
Be a pity not to
be using them.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.700
What's that you've found, then?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.000
Don't know.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.100
Don't know what this could be.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.200
It's me dress that's
what you've found.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.500
Yeah...

22:43.700 --> 22:46.000
But what's this,
under the dress?

22:46.100 --> 22:48.000
You have already
had your look at it.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.500
Is it...?

22:51.300 --> 22:52.100
Is it?

22:52.300 --> 22:53.900
You'll have to wait and see!

22:54.900 --> 22:56.800
Gates of Paradise...

23:01.400 --> 23:03.800
One of the seven
wonders of the world!

23:04.300 --> 23:05.700
Do you really think so?

23:05.800 --> 23:06.900
Yes.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.200
It's not too big?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.500
It's perfection, Flo.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.700
Oh, that's lovely...

23:14.800 --> 23:16.000
Hey, you see...?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.500
Oh yeah, do that again...

23:19.900 --> 23:21.400
Oh, that's nice...

23:35.800 --> 23:37.500
HEY! Get the fuck out of here!

23:38.400 --> 23:39.500
You pervert!

23:40.100 --> 23:41.700
Give your mother some privacy!

23:42.700 --> 23:43.900
Go back to bed, Bubby!

23:45.100 --> 23:47.200
Why the hell you call him Bubby?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.100
Bubby's a stupid name!

23:50.100 --> 23:52.100
I was waiting for
you to get back.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.900
But it suits him.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.700
Yeah, a stupid name
for a stupid kid!

25:28.000 --> 25:30.200
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.500
What the fuck...?

25:48.500 --> 25:50.300
The kid's completely crackers!

25:50.300 --> 25:51.500
You're a weirdo!

25:51.600 --> 25:53.200
Oh, Jesus Christ...

25:53.500 --> 25:55.600
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

25:56.200 --> 25:56.900
Am I?

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
Thank you.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.900
God, you've got great tits!

26:01.900 --> 26:04.700
Great, big whoppers of things!

26:07.300 --> 26:12.200
One of the seven wonders
of the world, Flo!

26:13.500 --> 26:15.600
It's perfection.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.800
Oh, Bubby...

26:17.100 --> 26:18.900
My little boy.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.800
Gates of Paradise...

26:21.900 --> 26:23.700
He's attacking me, Harold!

26:24.000 --> 26:24.800
Jesus Christ!

26:24.900 --> 26:25.900
Fuck me!

26:26.600 --> 26:27.700
Get the fuck out of here!

26:27.900 --> 26:29.200
YOU MAD BASTARD!

26:29.300 --> 26:30.700
You mad bastard!

26:30.800 --> 26:33.500
You fucking cunt! You get
the bastard out of here!

26:33.700 --> 26:35.900
- You got lovely skin, Flo.
- YOU SEXUAL PERVERT!

26:36.000 --> 26:38.200
- You're a weirdo!
- GET THAT CUNT OUT OF HERE!

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
GET OUT...!

26:42.300 --> 26:43.700
Leave Bubby alone!

26:44.600 --> 26:45.800
YOU DIRTY FUCKING SHIT!

26:46.200 --> 26:47.300
GET OUT!

26:48.400 --> 26:50.200
Get the fuck out of here!

27:55.100 --> 27:57.100
Oh, doormat. Excuse me.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.400
The fucking kid's
trying to be me again!

28:51.900 --> 28:53.800
SHUT THE FUCK UP, KID!

28:54.300 --> 28:57.700
You useless shit,
you perverted bastard...!

28:58.700 --> 29:00.500
You're good for nothing!

29:00.800 --> 29:04.100
Nothing... except messing
things up... isn't he, Flo?!

29:04.200 --> 29:06.900
Messed the place up good and
proper, didn't you, you little cunt!

29:09.200 --> 29:10.700
You useless cunt!

29:10.800 --> 29:12.800
- Why don't you piss off?!
- Leave Bubby alone!

29:12.800 --> 29:13.800
Leave Bubby alone!

29:14.400 --> 29:15.400
Leave Bubby alone!

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
You stupid useless kid,

29:17.500 --> 29:19.700
you should've been left to die!

29:20.100 --> 29:21.500
What did you say?!

29:21.600 --> 29:24.000
He should've been, the kid
should've been left to die!

29:25.100 --> 29:28.600
Oh, you bastard,
I kept him alive for you!

29:29.500 --> 29:32.000
Wasn't worth the
trouble you fat cow!

29:33.400 --> 29:34.500
You be still...

29:36.900 --> 29:37.700
You be still...

29:37.800 --> 29:39.500
YOU BE STILL!

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
You be still...

30:54.900 --> 30:57.400
Now... you be still, Pop.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.100
Mum...

31:14.500 --> 31:17.000
You be still, too.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.200
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.300
Get off the road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

34:50.699 --> 34:52.100
Get a look at the
bastard, will you!

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
You fucking poofter bastard!

36:01.700 --> 36:03.800
Nooo...!

36:04.100 --> 36:05.100
No...!

36:12.100 --> 36:13.300
Put money in it, bastard!

36:18.400 --> 36:19.900
He snatched my bloody handbag!

36:21.100 --> 36:22.400
Bloody bastard!

36:22.800 --> 36:24.100
Bloody bastard!

36:25.200 --> 36:26.000
Yeah...

36:26.300 --> 36:27.400
Yeah...

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
See you.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.900
See you.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.700
Bloody bastard...

36:35.100 --> 36:36.200
Bloody bastard...

38:52.700 --> 38:54.100
We'll sit in the back!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.300
We sit in the back!

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
Is it the usual?

39:35.600 --> 39:37.100
- Shall we have the usual?
- Yeah.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.800
Okay, hm, two specials, no pineapple!

39:40.900 --> 39:42.300
Alright, beautiful, thanks
very much. Alright.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.400
Lick! Your tongue!

40:37.000 --> 40:38.500
Yeah! Now lick me here!

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
Here, dummy!

40:41.200 --> 40:42.500
Oh, Christ, that prickles!

40:53.400 --> 40:54.600
Do you like singing?

41:02.100 --> 41:03.400
Do you like that?

41:05.800 --> 41:08.600
When I want to feel close
to my special friend, Jesus...

41:09.800 --> 41:12.700
I sing him a very special song...

41:14.900 --> 41:16.200
Do you want to hear it?

42:15.900 --> 42:19.200
It's my good friend
Jesus's favourite song.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.100
Did you like it?

42:28.200 --> 42:29.900
You're a dag!

42:30.000 --> 42:31.900
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

42:32.200 --> 42:33.700
Yeah, that's what you are!

42:34.300 --> 42:35.700
A weird kid!

42:36.200 --> 42:39.900
Nothing but a big...
weird... kid...

43:19.300 --> 43:22.000
Hey! Piss off out the way,
mate, I gotta cut this tree down!

43:22.800 --> 43:23.400
Hey!

43:23.400 --> 43:24.700
You fucking deaf?

43:25.400 --> 43:26.600
You're a queer looking
rooster, aren't you?

43:26.600 --> 43:27.800
What're you, fucking
one of them greenies?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.500
Hey! Come on, fuck off,
or I'll cut your prick off!

43:30.900 --> 43:32.500
You fucking idiot!
Go on, get out of it...

43:32.700 --> 43:34.600
Come on!

43:48.200 --> 43:49.300
Little...!

44:22.200 --> 44:24.100
Come on, let's just get out of here.

44:24.300 --> 44:25.900
You'll just come with me, sir!

44:26.000 --> 44:27.300
You don't want any
trouble now, do you?

44:27.300 --> 44:28.300
Come on! This way!

44:57.100 --> 44:58.300
Yes, mate! Can I help you?

45:02.100 --> 45:03.100
Err, printshop...

45:38.000 --> 45:39.400
Get, get, get...!!

45:40.000 --> 45:41.800
You try that again, mate,
and I'll call the cops!

46:17.100 --> 46:19.900
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

46:26.200 --> 46:27.100
Here we are! Thanks.

46:27.100 --> 46:28.200
Thank you, sweetie!

46:28.700 --> 46:29.200
Yes!

46:29.200 --> 46:32.500
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

46:37.200 --> 46:38.500
Two dollars! Thanks!

46:38.600 --> 46:39.700
Thank you, sweetie!

46:40.000 --> 46:41.700
Er, no, that'll be two
dollars, thanks, buddy!

46:43.800 --> 46:47.000
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

46:48.200 --> 46:49.300
Thank you, sweetie!

46:57.000 --> 46:58.700
I think we'd better find
out where you belong.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.800
To take you back there.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.100
Come on!

47:12.100 --> 47:13.100
Yes.

47:13.900 --> 47:15.700
I still look alright, don't I?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.900
Get off the fucking road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

47:33.700 --> 47:37.000
Get off the fucking road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

47:54.300 --> 47:56.200
I don't like fucking smart cunts!

48:05.800 --> 48:07.400
I saw what that
fucking pig did to you...

48:14.100 --> 48:15.100
Beer?

48:15.400 --> 48:16.500
There's some down here.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.100
I've gotta stop drinking.
I've gotta get my life in order.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.500
Who wants it?

48:21.600 --> 48:22.900
Bubby wants it!

48:24.000 --> 48:25.300
Bubby!

48:26.100 --> 48:27.600
Rip the scab off that one, mate!

48:29.100 --> 48:30.200
We need more beer!

48:30.300 --> 48:31.300
We need more beer!

48:33.000 --> 48:34.800
Let's give him a taste
of what's to come!

48:35.000 --> 48:36.300
Sure, a bit of rock'n'roll!

48:37.300 --> 48:39.600
One! Two!
One-two-three!

48:40.300 --> 48:41.700
#If you see Kay!

48:42.300 --> 48:45.700
#Can you tell her I'm leaving?
#Can you tell her I'm losing my mind?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.600
#If you see Kay!

48:47.700 --> 48:52.300
#Can you tell her I'm leaving
#If you'd say until she says okay

48:53.200 --> 48:55.400
#I've got to hear you say okay

48:55.500 --> 48:58.400
#I've got to make her take away

48:58.600 --> 49:03.300
#I can't figure it out any other way!

49:03.500 --> 49:04.600
#F. U. C. K!

49:04.700 --> 49:08.300
#Can you tell her I'll leave her?
#Can you tell her I'm losing my mind?

49:12.800 --> 49:13.900
How's it, roadie?

49:17.700 --> 49:18.800
I would never drive, mate!

49:21.100 --> 49:22.100
Hey, Bubby!

49:22.200 --> 49:23.400
Can you give us a hand, mate?

49:25.500 --> 49:27.200
Bubby is the apprentice roadie.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.800
That's good, Bubby.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.400
Bubby is the apprentice roadie.

49:35.900 --> 49:37.800
Yeah, just don't drop
the fucking speaker, okay?

49:39.100 --> 49:41.100
Just don't drop the
fucking speaker, okay?

49:45.400 --> 49:46.600
Oh, fuck!

49:47.500 --> 49:48.500
Jesus!

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Alright?

49:51.100 --> 49:52.100
Is this where the band
supposed to be?

49:52.300 --> 49:53.400
Yeah.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.400
Alright... Hm... What
time are you starting?

49:56.900 --> 49:59.100
About an hour and half ago,
but nobody's turned up yet.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.100
Want to come in?
We'll play!

50:01.800 --> 50:03.100
I... don't think so.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
I was hoping there'd be some girls.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.100
No girls, mate, only music.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
Thanks anyway!

50:12.100 --> 50:13.200
Who was that?

50:13.500 --> 50:16.000
I don't know. A neighbour complaining
about all the racket we were making.

50:16.300 --> 50:17.800
Ah, very fucking funny, mate.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.900
He was a customer.

50:18.900 --> 50:19.900
Where did he go?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
How the fuck would I know?
Down the road to see another band!

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
And you just let him walk out!

50:23.500 --> 50:25.400
What the fuck was I
supposed to do? Force him?

50:25.500 --> 50:26.800
How the fuck we're
going to pay for the hall,

50:26.800 --> 50:28.900
if you let all the people
walk out without paying!

50:29.000 --> 50:30.100
Jesus fucking Christ!

50:44.100 --> 50:45.200
Is that the lot?

50:47.300 --> 50:49.300
- I've nothing.
- I've nothing.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.500
What about you, hold-out?
Is that it?

50:54.800 --> 50:57.100
Try the other pocket, mate,
we saw you tried that one before.

50:59.500 --> 51:00.500
Nothing!

51:02.500 --> 51:03.500
Never anything.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.000
How about you?

51:10.100 --> 51:11.200
Got any money?

51:11.300 --> 51:12.300
Sure...

51:12.300 --> 51:13.300
Search him.

51:13.300 --> 51:14.400
Money! Do you have any money?

51:15.000 --> 51:16.200
You greedy little cunt!

51:16.300 --> 51:18.100
I ain't got enough money
to keep buying you milk!

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
So take that, mate!

51:22.300 --> 51:23.000
Shut up!

51:23.900 --> 51:25.400
Well, if that's all there is...

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
...we're stuffed.

51:28.200 --> 51:29.400
Yeah! We're stuffed.

51:30.700 --> 51:32.100
- Christ!
- Hilarious...

51:34.800 --> 51:37.900
No money, no girls...
It's enough to make you puke!

51:41.600 --> 51:43.800
And where's that fucking
smell coming from?!

51:43.900 --> 51:44.900
Your fucking feet!

51:44.900 --> 51:47.500
Fuck that fucking smell!
What about the fucking money?

51:50.200 --> 51:52.500
Hurry up, Bubby! We're
in the middle of a crisis!

51:52.600 --> 51:54.100
- Settle!
- It's okay, mate.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.400
CLINGWRAP KILLER

52:07.400 --> 52:08.400
- That be Mum!
- What?

52:09.100 --> 52:10.100
That be Pop!

52:10.900 --> 52:11.900
Them be Mum and Pop!

52:11.900 --> 52:13.000
What?

52:14.300 --> 52:15.400
Is that your mother?

52:15.700 --> 52:16.800
Bubby Mum!

52:17.300 --> 52:18.600
And your father?

52:21.600 --> 52:23.100
- What do you reckon...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

52:25.400 --> 52:26.500
Ah, wouldn't be him!

52:26.500 --> 52:27.500
Big shit!

52:27.600 --> 52:28.700
It wouldn't!

52:29.700 --> 52:31.500
- I don't know...
- It says there's a reward!

52:34.200 --> 52:36.600
Fifty thousand bucks!

52:39.300 --> 52:40.300
Take a look at this!

52:40.300 --> 52:41.300
- What is this...
- Aah, shit!

52:41.400 --> 52:42.400
- Christ!
- Fuck!

52:42.900 --> 52:44.000
That be Kat!

52:44.400 --> 52:45.800
No, it was a cat.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.700
Jesus...

52:51.800 --> 52:53.500
- Eer...
- It is him!

52:55.100 --> 52:56.600
- It has to be!
- Fifty grand!

52:57.800 --> 52:58.900
Oh, fuck...

52:59.000 --> 53:00.300
Alright, he's harmless!

53:00.300 --> 53:02.800
- Tell that to the cat.
- He can stay in your bed tonight.

53:07.700 --> 53:09.600
Jesus, Bubby, take
that cat outside, will you?

53:11.700 --> 53:13.000
Just take it
outside for a while.

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
Don't go too far, okay?

53:20.700 --> 53:21.800
Okay.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.000
Bring us back some
money or something!

53:29.700 --> 53:30.700
Okay!

53:39.100 --> 53:41.100
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

53:46.100 --> 53:47.400
Jesus fucking Christ!

53:47.500 --> 53:49.800
Get that fucking thing out of
here, you mad bastard! What...?

53:50.700 --> 53:53.600
I don't like fucking smart cunts!

55:28.200 --> 55:29.200
Well...

55:29.400 --> 55:30.300
If that's all there is...

55:31.500 --> 55:32.300
...we're stuffed.

55:35.100 --> 55:36.400
Ah, fucking racket!

55:36.400 --> 55:38.200
Yeah, they're probably after him.

55:40.300 --> 55:41.400
Oh, shit.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.400
- What're we gonna do now?
- We're gonna go to jail!

55:43.500 --> 55:45.500
I can feel it!
We're going to go to jail!

55:45.600 --> 55:47.500
- Bullshit!
- Shut up!

55:47.600 --> 55:48.600
Look! Look...!

55:53.400 --> 55:56.900
Let's just put these on.

56:31.600 --> 56:33.500
More trouble
that he's worth.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.400
You just take care
of that money.

56:47.100 --> 56:48.300
It's alright, Bubby.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.600
#Tell you a story
#that's sad but true

56:59.300 --> 57:03.300
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

57:03.500 --> 57:05.000
#A boy called Bubby

57:06.300 --> 57:08.800
#sitting right over there

57:11.500 --> 57:16.000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#with the wild, crazy hair...

57:17.100 --> 57:18.200
Bad Boy Bubby...

57:18.300 --> 57:19.300
#Oh, yeah!

57:19.300 --> 57:20.300
Bad boy...

57:20.400 --> 57:25.000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues

57:27.700 --> 57:33.000
#Got them? Bad Boy Bubby
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

57:37.000 --> 57:41.600
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues
#from my head right to my shoes...

57:42.700 --> 57:46.100
#Well, we met him
#when we were touring in '53

57:47.400 --> 57:50.600
#Well, that's not true
#but it rhymes with Bubby

57:51.700 --> 57:53.400
#Bad Boy Bubby

57:54.300 --> 57:55.400
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

58:05.000 --> 58:06.300
He's a classic, isn't he?

58:06.400 --> 58:08.400
You don't own
a cat, do you, Dan?

58:11.200 --> 58:13.100
We're going to leave
you with Dan, Bubby. Okay?

58:13.100 --> 58:14.100
See you, Bubby!

58:15.300 --> 58:16.400
And don't be a bad boy!

58:17.300 --> 58:20.300
#Bad Boy Bubby...
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

58:43.200 --> 58:44.200
Hey! Hey!

59:25.800 --> 59:28.300
Why don't you go and talk
to her, if she's so interesting?

59:38.900 --> 59:40.300
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

59:43.100 --> 59:44.300
God, you've got great tits.

59:46.900 --> 59:48.500
Great, big whoppers of things.

59:50.600 --> 59:52.500
You're a very cruel person,
do you know that?

59:53.000 --> 59:55.600
Just because you're rich,
and you're handsome, you...

59:55.700 --> 59:58.600
...you think it's okay
to make fun of people like me?

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200
Well, it's not funny!

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800
It's just hurtful!

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.900
Bubby naughty bad boy,

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900
dirty little cunt!

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.900
Oh, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.900
Just please, leave me...
Go away from me!

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.600
SOMEONE HELP ME!

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.600
Why don't you
bastards do something!

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.300
Watch the language, lady, or I
cool you off for a couple of days!

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.200
Hey, we're not the
bloody criminals!

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.400
Those arseholes
stole our purses!

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.100
We can't help if you go
walk about at night by yourselves!

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.000
Who'd want to steal from a boong?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.600
Oh, for Christ's sake!

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.500
We were on our way home from work!

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.800
Work?! Huh! That'd be the day!
Something illegal, no doubt!

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.100
Youse are really fucked!

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.500
Now, I warned you
about the language!

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600
Now you can piss off out of here!

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.000
And consider yourselves lucky
I didn't lock up the pair of you!

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.700
Fuck, let's go!

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.700
I'd have that head wound seen to!

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.900
Get fucked!

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300
Psst!

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.700
Whatcha doin'?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.500
What ya doin'?

01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.400
What're you doin'?

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.200
Why don't you talk to me more?

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.100
What, cat got your tongue?

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.900
I got feelings too, you know.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.100
But...

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.400
Not fun being on
night shift, is it?

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.200
Get lonely, you know.

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.600
Why don't you talk to me?

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.400
Get fucked!

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.000
Leave me alone!
Please leave me alone!

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.200
Someone help me!

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.000
You want out?!

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.500
It's the Animal for you,
you fucking nutter!

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.900
Me be Bubby.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.600
The Clingwrap Killer.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.200
You have been rehabilitated.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.500
Here's ten dollars to
see you on your way.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.700
You can go.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.700
Don't let me see
you back here.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.000
Well...

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.500
If that's all there is...

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.300
...we're stuffed!

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.200
Jesus can see everything I do...

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.300
...and he's going to beat me brainless!

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:19.500
Come!

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.200
You see...

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:49.399
No one's going to help you, Bubby.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.700
Because there isn't
anybody out there to do it.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.100
No one.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.400
We're all just complicated arrangements

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.000
of atoms and subatomic particles,

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100
we don't live.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.300
But our atoms do move
about in such a way

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.800
as to give us identity
and consciousness.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.000
We don't die;

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.400
our atoms just rearrange
themselves.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.900
There is no God.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.100
There can be no God,

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.700
it's ridiculous to think in
terms of a superior being.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.000
An inferior being,
maybe, because we,

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.000
we who don't even exist,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.300
we arrange our lives with more order

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.300
and harmony than God ever
arranged the earth.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.100
We measure...

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.700
Plot...

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.100
We create wonderful music.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.100
We are the architects
of our own existence.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.900
What a lunatic concept
to bow down before a God

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.500
who slaughters millions
of innocent children...

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.500
Who slowly and agonisingly
starves them to death...

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.900
beats them,

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.400
tortures them...

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.600
Rejects them.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.500
What folly to even think that
we should not insult such a God...

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
Damn him!

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.500
Think him out of existence.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.700
It is our duty to think
God out of existence.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.500
It is our duty to insult Him.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.100
Fuck you, God!

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.400
Strike me down
if you dare, you tyrant!

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.700
You non-existent fraud!

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.500
It is the duty of all human beings

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.300
to think God out of existence.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.700
Then we have a future.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.700
Because then,
and only then,

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.300
do we take full responsibility
for who we are.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.300
And that's what
you must do, Bubby!

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.500
Think God out of existence.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.000
Take responsibility for who you are!

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.500
Fuck you, God!

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.700
Strike me down, if you dare!

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.800
Fuck you, God.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.700
Fuck you, God!

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400
Strike me down, if you dare!

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Hello!

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.700
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.300

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.900
- What're you doing?!

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.500
Let's get him!

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.000
- You pervert!
- Son of a bitch!

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.500
You be's right...

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.600
You be right, Mum...

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.200
Bubby no fit
no more out there.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.900
#Tell you a story

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.200
#Sad but true

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.500
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.600
#Bad Boy Bubby

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.700
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.800
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.500
#A boy called Bubby

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.600
#sitting right over there...

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#with the wild, crazy hair...

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.200
Yeah, wherever you want.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.500
Anything to drink...?

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.100
...father?

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.200
Pizza.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Got any money?

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.500
Money...

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.600
That's all there is.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.400
Then you just want pizza?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.400
Pizza.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.100
Well, what sort of pizza?

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.700
Pizza!

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.100
Alright!

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.200
No trouble, okay?

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.000
Pop no trouble be.

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.400
Alright, Pop.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Keep your money.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.500
Cat!

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.200
Good cat.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800
Good cat.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.900
Don't move, you little cunt!

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.000
I'll beat you brainless, by... Christ...

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.300
Good cat.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.800
Don't go, cat.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200

Don't go!

Can you spare a buck, mate?

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.500
Fifty cents then?

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.000
Alright, then twenty?

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.500

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.000
That's all there is!

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.200
That all?

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.400
Oh...

Let me buy youse a drink!

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.500
That be Paul!

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.300
Ungrateful bastard!

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.100
#A place where nothing ever ends

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.800
#Where feelings never fall asleep

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.900
#Just like in a miracle

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.800
#You'll find her, you'll see her

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
#There, between the silence and the sleep

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.100
#Want her
#Be hers

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:06.500
#There, between the fallen and the dream

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Get him!

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.100
Get him!

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.100
Jesus Christ!

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.700
Get that fucking thing out
of here, you mad bastard!

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.200
Get off the fucking road,
you greenie bastard!

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.900
Look at the silly bastard,
would you?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.300
You poofter bastard!

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.500
Hey, son!

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.000
You can call me Pop!

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I'm your Pop!

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.100
Hey, Pop!

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.600
Hello, son.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.600
Hello, Pop!

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600
Yeah, yeah, that'll do!

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.500
Don't go making
a big thing of it!

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.400
What's the matter
with you, son?

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.600
You got a bit of a mental
condition or something?

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.500
Fucking kid's trying
to be me again.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.800
Shut the fuck up, kid!

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.000
You useless cunt!

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.700
Why don't you piss off?!

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.200
Leave Bubby alone...

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.300
Leave Bubby alone!

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.800
Fucking useless shit,
should've been left to die!

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.300
#You'll find her
#You'll see her

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.100
#There, between the silence and the sleep

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.500
#Want her
#Be hers

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.600
#There, between the fallen and the dream

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.200
Stocking up there, Bubby?

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.800
Not Bubby.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.100
Me Pop now.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.600
What's the pizza for, Pop?

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.100
Pizza for Cat.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.000
You still got that bloody cat?

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.100
Don't worry about it, Bubby.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.700
We'll get you more
pizza tomorrow.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.100
Pop get pizza for Cat now!

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.100
Hey, you can't go anywhere!

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.500
We need you tomorrow night.
You're part of the band now!

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500
Cat hungry!

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.200
Wait a minute, Bubby.

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.900
Look, Pop. Just wait.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.300
Tonight, you were good.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.800
They loved you out there.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.500
And you loved it out there.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.300
We want you to do it
every night.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.500
Tomorrow night, and the next.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Okay?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.200
It's a regular gig here.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:22.900
Stay with us,
we'll look after you.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.000
For sure!

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.000
Pop give pizza to Cat.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.200
We'll take you wherever
the bloody cat is!

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.300
No!

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.800
No.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.300
Pop go to Cat!

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.100
Pop sleep with Cat.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.600
Come on, we can't just let him go.
We'll never see him again.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.800
We can't force him to stay.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100
Bubby, please!

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.000
Bubby been left to die.

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.100
Me Pop now!

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.600
And don't lose it!

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.500
Remember: when it gets dark,
give the note to someone,

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.400
they'll bring you
back here, we'll pay!

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.700
What's going on?
Go back to your woman.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.700
I hope he makes it back.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.100
Gonna be a dull gig
tomorrow, if he doesn't.

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200
See you!

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400
Fucking bit me!

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Kill the fucking thing!

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.200
Break its fucking neck!

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.000
Fucking cat made me bleed!

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.100
Leave Cat alone!

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.300
Cat!

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200
Pop got pizza!

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.400
Come on, Cat.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Pizza!

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:04.900
Don't be still, Cat!

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.600
She say Cat be dead.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Is Cat dead?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.900
Yes. Cat's dead.

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:46.400
What did she say?

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
She say you name be Angel.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.800
Oh, my God!

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.000
You understand them!

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.600
You understand what she said!

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.700
You must have more
names than just Pop!

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.400
Pop!

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800
Me be Pop!

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.800
You can call me Pop!

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.500
Pop, we just want to find out
where you come from.

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.800
Where do you live?

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.700
Pop don't know.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.800
Bubby don't know.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.200
Do you think he might be schizo?

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.100
I don't think he's anything...
He's just a... kid!

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:22.200
Bubby a big weird kid!

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.700
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.000
Pop not a kid!

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.800
If we take him anywhere,
they're going to lock him up!

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.400
And I feel he shouldn't
be locked up!

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.400
What is it, Rachael?

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.900
She think me should stay!

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.800
Is that what you
think, Rachael?

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:54.900
What about the others?

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.500
What do you think?

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.700
Do you want Pop to stay?

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:00.200
Yes. Yes!

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.000
Well, I'm sure you've got
some stories to tell!

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.700
Like who's Bubby,
for instance?

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.000
You're Bubby, aren't you?

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.700
Bubby been left to die!

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:20.800
Me Pop now!

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.400
Oh...

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.400
Pop want to see Angel's tits!

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.000
No.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.300
But I'll show Bubby!

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.800
Bubby want to see Angel's tits!

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.000
I don't hear Bubby!

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.800
Bubby no fit no more out here!

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.400
Me Bubby.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.200
Them be beautiful.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Like Mum.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.900
Don't you think
they're too big?

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.600
Them be perfection!

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.500
Okay...

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.700
It's enough for now...

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.700
You go back to being Pop.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.300
And Bubby's our secret.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.300
Okay?

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.900
It's a garden, and
it's filled with roses...

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.400
All different colours...

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.800
And it smells so
beatiful in the garden.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.800
It is a very special garden.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.600
No one knows about this garden...

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.900
No one is allowed to come in.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.100
Only people who love you.

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.700
Only people who care

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.800
about you.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.100
And only people
you want to let in.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.200
There's a very high picket fence

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.800
around the garden...

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.400
Hidden in the high grass...

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.800
And no one can see it.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Imagine yourself being
in that garden...

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.200
lying on the grass...

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.000
feeling very comfortable.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.500
It's a beautiful day.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.100
The sun is shining...

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.400
and it's warm.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:49.100
And the wind gently
touches your cheeks...

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.700
Hi.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.800
I'm off duty now, so I'm going to
show you where you'll be sleeping.

01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.500
Rachael think Pop
stay in her room.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.000
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.400
Sorry, Rachael, but Pop
will stay in Pandy's room.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.700
Okay?

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:14.200
Here's your bed

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.200
and there's your suitcase

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.900
and I put your cat
in the freezer,

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.800
we can bury that
tomorrow, okay?

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.100
A band?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.300
Cat got your tongue?

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.500
It's the Animal for you!

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.600
Psst! Pop!

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.200
Come here!

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.900
We've got a surprise for you!

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.800
We've got some people who'd
really like to get to know you!

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.000
Come on, come on!

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.100
Go, get'em, Pop!

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.400
Is that you, Pop?

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.500
Me be Pop!

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm Shannon!

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.500
I'm Sharon!

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.400
Won't you join us?

01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.700
What do you think?

01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.800
Do you like us?

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.500
I've never had a virgin before!

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:06.700
Don't be scared!

01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.200
We'll show you what to do!

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.900
Tiny tits...

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.100
Tiny?!

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.300
These aren't tiny,
they're perfect 36's!

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.800
Where did you come from?

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.100
Them not Angel tits.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.200
Who's Angel?

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.200
I don't know...

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.100
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.800
Good-bye, Cat.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400
There...

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.700
She's happy with God now!

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.900
It is the duty of all human beings

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.900
to think God out of existence.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.200
Full of surprises, aren't we...

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.100
Be still, Kat!

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.600
I'll beat you brainless,
by Christ!

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.700
Poison don't get you...

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.100
God will...!

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.300
Them not tiny tits!

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.500
Them great big
whoppers of things!

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.100
Pop love them tits!

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.600
Pop love them tits!

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:41.600
No.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.100
No!

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.600
That not be.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.200
Not be...

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.100
What's the matter, Bubby?

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.400
Bubby crying with
sadness for Rachael...

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.400
because Rachael
have no Bubby.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.700
Rachael...

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.000
be loving Bubby.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.400
Oh, my poor Rachael...

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.400
And Bubby be loving Angel...

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.800
Oh, Bubby...

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.700
I only really visit
when I have to.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.000
It always ends in a fight.

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.800
And then I don't
go for a while...

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.400
And then they forgive me,

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.000
then we fight all over again.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.000
A bit of a mess

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:02.300
but dad's a collector.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.500
Used to be his business.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.700
Princess Pink!

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.600
This is going to be fun...

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.500
How do you like
your dinner, Mr Pop?

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.000
Pizza be better than this.

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.500
Our daughter has a healthy
appetite, don't you think?

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600
Mother, don't start.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.200
Be quiet! Let your mother
speak uninterrupted!

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.300
Thank you, dear!

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.000
We tried to bring her up
as best as we could

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.000
but she's been rather
a disappointment to us.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.500
Be the first time you
didn't finish your dinner!

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.200
I find fat people so...

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.200
so gross!

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.400
So unfortunate, of course

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.000
but so...

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.600
ugly...

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.400
And what do you think, Mr Pop?

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.600
Me think Angel be beautiful.

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.200
She's a fat slut!

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.700
Be careful what you say, dear!

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.800
Better he'd know that
she's a fat slut!

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.300
If God had wanted
us to be fat

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.000
he'd have made us all
the same weight, wouldn't he?

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.700
But he didn't!

01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.500
God doesn't like fat people!

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.300
Fat people are an
abomination in his eyes!

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.100
Fuck you, God!

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.500
Strike me down, if you dare!

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.300
Angel be beautiful!

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.400
God be a useless cunt!

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.100
NO!

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.300
Why you be bad to Angel?

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.700
You can go now, Mr Pop!

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.800
We shall pray for you!

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.400
Get out of here!

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.100
Angel come too?

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.700
My parents were just waiting
to die anyway, Bubby.

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:31.700
They were both riddled
with poisons and cancers...

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.700
Asbestos from the break linings...

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.200
Lead from the car exhaust.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.900
PCP's from the car seats.

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:44.200
Dioxins,

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.200
parathidions,

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.400
dieldrin...

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.700
Mercury.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.600
Radioactivity.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.200
Whoever did it, just
put them out of their misery.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.200
Ashes to ashes...

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:03.500
dust to dust.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.900
That be nice.

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.000
That be poisoning us!

01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.300
That be poisoning the air
that we breathe!

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.300
If the poison don't get you...

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.100
then God will!

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.900
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.100
Fantastic.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.500
And yet...

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.700
This is mob have been
trying for centuries

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.400
to clingwrap this mob.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Even though they
share the same god.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.200
Mind you,

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.700
this mob have been getting
pretty good at clingwrapping lately.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.800
And this mob's got
the same god as well.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:22.700
But they've had a fair go of
clingwrapping that first mob...

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.300
They've been trying to clingwrap

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.200
that second mob for a good
couple of thousand years.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.500
And they pretty well
ucceeded in clingwrapping

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.700
just about all of this mob.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.600
They never did much
clingwrapping...

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.300
to anyone...

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.300
but themselves.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.000
Then there's this lot.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.000
A different god altogether.

01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:50.000
You'd think that would help.

01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:51.800
But it doesn't.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:53.800
See, this mob

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:56.300
clingwrapped about half a million

01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.600
of that first mob.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.200
Fourty or fifty years ago.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.700
And they've been at it ever since.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.800
They've all done their
fair share of killing

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.400
or being killed.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.000
And it's all pointless.

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.200
The thing, Bubby, is:

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.700
don't be like them.

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.000
No matter how mad you
get at someone...

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.400
don't kill them.

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:22.900
Ever.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.100
Bubby done clingwrap them.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.700
Me Pop now!

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.300
Talking like you'll be running
the country soon enough...

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:34.400
No more excuses!

01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.400
No more clingwrapping.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.900
Okay?

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:44.800
Bubby?

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.400
Okay.

01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.100
And...

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.600
don't mention it to anyone.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.100
We look like all being...

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.400
rich and famous
soon enough, so...

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.500
let's not spoil it.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.400
Okay.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.400
Collars!

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:17.300
Yes, mate?

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.400
How much that be?

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.600
That be five dollar!

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.200
Where be Pop?

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.600

01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.000

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.800
