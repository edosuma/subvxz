01:47.518 --> 01:50.852
<i>That's it, that's it, that's lovely.
I want to get the three of you.</i>

01:50.854 --> 01:52.788
<i>Am I holding this
thing upside down?</i>

01:52.790 --> 01:54.790
- <i>Make sure you get the cake.</i>
- <i>Right, okay.</i>

01:54.792 --> 01:56.291

<i>Dear Omar, I must
confess to knowing more</i>

02:11.007 --> 02:13.240
<i>about your father than
I ever let on.</i>

02:13.242 --> 02:16.711
<i>Your mother was young
and impetuous when she met him,</i>

02:16.713 --> 02:18.578
<i>but despite her tender years,</i>

02:18.580 --> 02:20.850
<i>she cared for you
with great maturity.</i>

02:21.750 --> 02:24.584
<i>I've left all you'll need

02:24.586 --> 02:25.687
<i>your real dad one day.</i>

02:26.888 --> 02:30.291
<i>Be strong, Omar
and look after your brother.</i>

02:30.293 --> 02:33.228
<i>I'll always love ya, Gran.</i>

04:02.346 --> 04:04.248
- Hello, Peter. Hello
- Hiya.

04:05.316 --> 04:07.682
Oh, it's like climbing Everest.

04:07.684 --> 04:10.252
- Do you want Ken to carry you?
- No, no, I should be fine...

04:10.254 --> 04:11.986
- You sure?
- From here. Hiya.

04:11.988 --> 04:13.755
Welcome, welcome.

04:13.757 --> 04:15.390
Oh, bless you, come on in.

04:15.392 --> 04:19.394
- This is it, this is you.
- Yeah.

04:19.396 --> 04:20.764
Shut the door.

04:21.998 --> 04:24.999
So, this is your room, Peter.

04:25.001 --> 04:27.935
We've had the bathroom through
there fitted with a special shower.

04:27.937 --> 04:29.137
Oh great, cheers.

04:29.139 --> 04:31.173
Least we can do, with your...

04:33.008 --> 04:34.174
Leg situation.

04:34.176 --> 04:36.276
Mmm, no, don't.

04:36.278 --> 04:38.812
Oh, nice one, a foot spa.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.714
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

04:40.716 --> 04:43.886
Oh, and there are plenty
of fresh clothes in here.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.987
In the wardrobe,
got some nice shirts,

04:47.989 --> 04:51.325
jumpers and some pants,
and some socks,

04:51.327 --> 04:54.894
and some of my old
loafers, there.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.430
This is great.

04:56.432 --> 04:59.667
Yeah, thank you so much.

05:01.803 --> 05:04.403
Well, I mean, really,
what we want is for you to be,

05:04.405 --> 05:07.906
after all you've been through
with everything um, to be happy.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.210
- Be happy.
- Happy.

05:10.345 --> 05:12.380
Well, we want you
both to be happy.

05:14.248 --> 05:18.085
Well, hopefully, we can
offer you a bit of stability.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.887
Oh, you look so like your dad.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.889
Stop it, isn't he?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.856
- So like his dad.
- He's not fallen far from the tree, has he?

05:25.858 --> 05:27.392
No, not really.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.230
You know, he tried ever so hard,
your dad to try and,

05:31.265 --> 05:33.231
you know, make everything
sort of work

05:33.233 --> 05:34.200
after that whole...

05:36.302 --> 05:38.969
With the, well, anyway, its...

05:38.971 --> 05:41.939
Well, there's probably not much
point in dredging up the old...

05:41.941 --> 05:44.942
No, I'm not dredging
anything up, I'm just saying.

05:44.944 --> 05:48.878
Oh, would you like me to
take that for you, Omar?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.284
No, you're all right, thanks.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.083
Right, well can you try not to
spill it on the carpet please,

05:54.085 --> 05:55.985
because it's Axminster.

05:55.987 --> 05:58.290
- Right.
- Although it is ash colored, so...

05:59.191 --> 06:00.957
Yeah.

06:18.108 --> 06:21.043
I'm waitin' for the owl to come
to tell me I've got into Hogwarts.

06:21.045 --> 06:23.512
Uncle Ken said you'd be
in here three weeks, tops.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.247
You can do three
weeks, can't you?

06:25.249 --> 06:27.051
You are lovin' this, aren't you?

06:28.052 --> 06:30.985
They have no idea what a lying
little shit you are, do they?

06:30.987 --> 06:33.455
With the thievin' and
the schemin' and,

06:33.457 --> 06:35.122
is that a cravat?

06:35.124 --> 06:36.893
Have you finished
moanin' now, O?

06:38.462 --> 06:40.228
I'm not going back into Carron.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.096
You'd heard the rumors.

06:42.098 --> 06:43.998
MPs love a good-looking
lad like me.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.200
I wouldn't last two minutes
and I can't run away.

06:46.202 --> 06:48.135
Easy target, isn't it?

06:48.137 --> 06:50.538
Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm off for a date

06:50.540 --> 06:52.175
with a foot spa.

06:53.243 --> 06:58.144
<i>♪ Doo doo dada dada dah ♪</i>

06:58.146 --> 06:59.879
<i>♪ Life is good ♪</i>

06:59.881 --> 07:01.414
<i>♪ Doo do doo doo ♪</i>

07:07.022 --> 07:09.091
<i>♪ Dah dah ♪</i>

07:22.069 --> 07:26.338
Ken, dinner. Ken.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.410
Just making sure
everything's turned off properly.

07:35.849 --> 07:40.586
Now, we have some exciting
news for you, don't we Ken?

07:40.588 --> 07:41.488
Hmm.

07:42.856 --> 07:45.290
- Ken?
- Hmm?

07:45.292 --> 07:48.026
Ken!
Some exciting news, don't we?

07:48.028 --> 07:49.527
Oh, oh yes.

07:49.529 --> 07:52.898
Well, we've been talking
about adoption.

07:53.866 --> 07:57.468
- Giving you some proper security.
- Family.

07:57.470 --> 08:00.137
It really means a lot,
you takin' us in like this.

08:00.139 --> 08:03.073
Well, I can't think of anything that
would give my brother greater satisfaction

08:03.075 --> 08:05.642
than Ken and I doing
right by you.

08:05.644 --> 08:08.445
- It's good, isn't it, Omar?
- Yeah, thank you.

08:08.447 --> 08:12.649
No, I'm so sorry, no we
just meant Pete, actually.

08:12.651 --> 08:16.018
You're not our side, I mean,
you understand, don't you?

08:16.020 --> 08:18.388
I mean, I'm not even
sure if it is allowed

08:18.390 --> 08:22.827
for us because they have
rules now for adoption.

08:27.498 --> 08:30.633
But, we'd still be brothers.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.400
Oh, yes of course.

08:32.403 --> 08:34.936
You'll always be brothers.

08:34.938 --> 08:36.808
And he could still live here?

08:40.611 --> 08:42.544
Yes, of course he can.

08:42.547 --> 08:44.548
Yes, of course he can,
long as he likes.

08:46.283 --> 08:48.283
Do you want some broccoli?

08:48.285 --> 08:50.552
- Yeah, I'd love some, thanks.
- Help yourself.

08:50.554 --> 08:54.057
- Ken, pass your plate.
- Set it up.

09:46.073 --> 09:47.639
I want everything
either given back,

09:47.641 --> 09:49.074
or paid for, do you hear me?

09:49.076 --> 09:50.142
I'd didn't do anything.

09:50.144 --> 09:52.377
You let him do it.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.446
Now, you get in there
and you say you're sorry.

09:54.448 --> 09:56.083
- Yes, Gran.
- Yes, sorry, Gran.

10:06.159 --> 10:09.262
Pete! Omar! Have a drink, love.

10:11.297 --> 10:13.097
Ow!

11:13.690 --> 11:15.425
Knew you'd be here.

11:27.169 --> 11:28.337
Think I'm going
to go find my dad.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.706
- What?
- Gran knew where he was all along,

11:32.708 --> 11:35.244
she just never let on.

11:36.311 --> 11:37.646
It was all in the letter.

11:41.783 --> 11:43.017
I ain't read mine.

11:44.218 --> 11:46.187
I can't. Not yet.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.790
When are we going then?

11:50.792 --> 11:52.760
I think I need to
do this on my own.

11:55.263 --> 11:56.230
Without me?

11:57.865 --> 11:59.798
But I promised Gran
I'd look after ya.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.433
Dog and the wolf, remember?

12:01.435 --> 12:03.369
Yeah, but, I mean,

12:03.371 --> 12:04.572
it could be a difficult journey,

12:05.606 --> 12:07.706
and I don't know how
long it will take.

12:07.708 --> 12:09.342
I mean, it could be dangerous.

12:11.812 --> 12:13.745
Where you going, then? India?

12:13.747 --> 12:16.714
No, Blackpool.

12:16.716 --> 12:19.317
Blackpool? How's that difficult?

12:19.319 --> 12:20.552
It's only down the moat a way.

12:20.554 --> 12:23.423
Difficult emotionally.

12:27.426 --> 12:29.192
I'm sorry.

12:29.194 --> 12:31.664
Omar, come back.

12:32.665 --> 12:33.566
Please.

12:36.402 --> 12:38.235
Come on, Omar.

12:38.237 --> 12:39.603
Omar!

12:39.605 --> 12:41.072
Omar!

12:42.841 --> 12:45.377
I'll let you have
a go at me foot spa!

12:46.679 --> 12:48.581
It's got loads of settings!

12:51.482 --> 12:53.149
Please!

12:53.151 --> 12:54.717
Please, Omar, don't go!

12:54.719 --> 12:56.087
Don't go!

13:07.364 --> 13:11.333
All right, you can come,
but no stealin'.

13:16.908 --> 13:19.407
Blackpool.

13:19.409 --> 13:22.544
Come on, Omar.
What are you waitin' for, man?

13:32.923 --> 13:36.659
Do you reckon he's got some sort of
like, weird clock socket fetish?

13:37.961 --> 13:40.661
- You stole Ken's phone?
- Well, I thought it'd come in handy.

13:40.663 --> 13:42.596
If you had the number for
your dad you could ring and say

13:42.598 --> 13:44.264
why'd did you never love me?

13:44.266 --> 13:46.467
Probably a shame
thing, I reckon.

13:46.469 --> 13:48.704
- Shut up.
- I watched quite a lot of Jeremy Kyle.

13:49.739 --> 13:52.338
You could go on there
if you wanted.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.440
Free night in a hotel.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.511
Why have you been such
a bastard, Dad?

13:57.679 --> 13:59.646
Are you done?

13:59.648 --> 14:01.316
It's knackerin', this walk.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.885
Workin' me all day,
very, very hard.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.353
Workin' me to the bone,
Mr. Omar, please!

14:08.355 --> 14:12.457
- Pete, shut up.
- Please relent, please show some mercy, Mr. Omar.

14:12.459 --> 14:13.558
I'm a kind soul.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.460
I mean no harm.

14:15.462 --> 14:17.596
- Please!
- You do realize that's offensive?

14:17.598 --> 14:20.599
I have nothing more
left to give, Mr. Omar.

14:20.601 --> 14:21.667
I give you everything.

14:21.669 --> 14:23.268
I give you my life.

14:23.270 --> 14:25.837
I got a family to
look after, sir.

14:25.839 --> 14:28.840
Oh, please, Mr. Omar, don't
send me back to that place.

14:28.842 --> 14:30.676
- Pete.
- I got a family now.

14:30.678 --> 14:33.945
- Hey, people are lookin'!
- I got a family to support here.

14:33.947 --> 14:36.280
- I'm sorry, I'm not with him.
- Please, I don't want to,

14:36.282 --> 14:38.315
- I don't want to go back to that place.
- I don't even know him.

14:38.317 --> 14:39.884
I don't want to,
I don't want to do it

14:39.886 --> 14:41.919
no more, Mr. Omar, please.

14:41.921 --> 14:43.788
I'm going to
leave you here.

14:43.790 --> 14:46.791
Oh, no, please
don't leave me.

14:46.793 --> 14:48.759
Although there are some
tramps lurkin' about.

14:48.761 --> 14:50.262
Might get some free cider.

14:52.531 --> 14:54.264
It's at times like
these, you know,

14:54.266 --> 14:55.933
I think it's important
to consort the help

14:55.935 --> 14:57.600
of some professionals.

14:57.602 --> 14:58.503
What do you mean?

14:59.604 --> 15:01.638
Tarot cards.

15:13.919 --> 15:16.052
There is someone in
your future who will

15:16.054 --> 15:17.856
want to open doors for you.

15:19.024 --> 15:21.557
You need to identify
who that person is

15:21.559 --> 15:23.559
and avoid air travel with them.

15:23.561 --> 15:25.427
Thank you.

15:31.969 --> 15:35.403
I feel you're not just here for fun,
I feel you've come on a mission.

15:35.405 --> 15:37.007
- Yeah.
- That makes sense, right.

15:38.441 --> 15:40.243
Have we got a connection
here with

15:41.678 --> 15:44.512
- someone what's died?
- Yeah.

15:44.514 --> 15:46.047
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:46.049 --> 15:47.317
And you got 'em cremated.

15:49.351 --> 15:52.789
I've got a
letter and I want to say it's...

15:53.990 --> 15:56.389
this could be a letter
of the start of a name

15:56.391 --> 15:58.658
or could be at the end of a name

15:58.660 --> 16:01.495
or even one that's
been left out,

16:01.497 --> 16:02.898
and it's like a I, E.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.599
- E.
- E.

16:05.601 --> 16:07.501
- E, Edith.
- Edith.

16:07.503 --> 16:08.535
That's what I got.

16:08.537 --> 16:09.705
Yeah.

16:10.906 --> 16:13.441
- Me Gran.
- Yes, yes, I got that.

16:14.676 --> 16:17.612
Edith and I want to say she
was like a grandmother to ya.

16:18.914 --> 16:22.483
Yeah, okay and now your
Gran is watching ya

16:23.885 --> 16:24.952
the whole time.

16:26.821 --> 16:30.456
Yeah, they can see
everything, okay?

16:30.458 --> 16:31.793
They even through duvets.

16:34.095 --> 16:36.028
Choose a card.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.665
What's it say?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.002
- Death.
- Death, right, don't panic.

16:43.004 --> 16:45.637
Have you heard in tarot, death
doesn't always mean death.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.705
- Yeah.
- Have you?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.874
All right, that's not something
I particularly go with.

16:49.876 --> 16:53.477
I mean, I tend to go for more
literal meaning of the cards,

16:53.479 --> 16:55.980
so had you have got the
moon, you'd see the moon.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.550
If you got the stars,
you'd see the stars.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.920
If you'd have got
the hierophant, you know,

17:02.922 --> 17:05.357
maybe you'll end up
getting one of them.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.692
Do you want to do one?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.829
Go for, try and go
for one of these.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.532
- It's death.
- Death again.

17:17.535 --> 17:20.569
Give it here.
There's loads to choose from.

17:20.571 --> 17:23.775
Sometimes people say a
death means change, uh huh.

17:24.675 --> 17:27.009
- Right.
- So let's go with that, yeah?

17:27.011 --> 17:28.613
Today you're alive and well,

17:30.148 --> 17:31.749
and that might change.

17:33.084 --> 17:34.784
I don't know to say
other than now might be

17:34.786 --> 17:36.486
a good time to clean
out your hard drive.

17:37.655 --> 17:40.689
Is there like,
an artifact, that may be

17:40.691 --> 17:44.062
in connection here with Edith
that I could hold to help me?

17:45.729 --> 17:48.197
- Right.
- A photograph.

17:48.199 --> 17:51.633
What I'm sensin' is one of
the people in this picture

17:51.635 --> 17:52.769
is important to you.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.038
I'm going to go with...

18:00.443 --> 18:02.411
- Malik.
- Malik, yes, Malik...

18:03.446 --> 18:05.779
- Chowdery.
- Chowdery, yes.

18:05.781 --> 18:07.750
Malik Chowdery.

18:09.619 --> 18:15.055
I feel that you are tryin' to find this
gentleman. I feel you will find him.

18:15.057 --> 18:18.127
Does that make sense?
If you keep lookin'.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.741
Can you hear that?

18:33.808 --> 18:35.442
- Yeah.
- It's like a howlin'.

18:37.979 --> 18:39.580
Is there a connection
here with a wolf?

18:40.547 --> 18:42.882
- Yeah,
- or maybe a dog?

18:45.053 --> 18:46.187
This is stupid.

18:49.990 --> 18:51.091
Omar!

18:52.259 --> 18:53.160
Omar!

18:54.862 --> 18:57.763
Just out of interest,
what's the best way

18:57.765 --> 19:00.866
- to destroy a hard drive?
- Well, the way I'd do it, I'd get a drill,

19:00.868 --> 19:05.037
drill straight through, that way not even
the police can recover the information.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.199
Do you remember that
story I used to tell you

19:36.201 --> 19:37.501
when you were little?

19:38.270 --> 19:40.706
The one about
the dog and the wolf.

19:41.639 --> 19:45.108
One day, a dog went for a walk
in the woods and he met a wolf.

19:45.110 --> 19:49.914
"Brother Wolf," said the dog,
"you look so faint.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.050
Come and live with
me and me master.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.487
I eat every day
and I never want for food."

19:58.556 --> 20:04.659
And the wolf said, "I would
rather be starving and free

20:04.661 --> 20:07.129
than fat and a slave."

20:07.131 --> 20:12.168
And with that, he turned and
trotted off back into the forest.

20:14.771 --> 20:16.838
I'm the wolf, aren't I?
And Omar's the dog.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.140
- Why are you the wolf?
- Well, I'm a thoroughbred, you're a poodle.

20:19.142 --> 20:20.675
You look like
a Yorkshire Terrier.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.044
Cack it in, you two.

20:23.046 --> 20:26.680
I want you to look
after each other.

20:26.682 --> 20:30.584
That wolf probably
died the next day,

20:30.586 --> 20:31.752
alone in the woods.

20:38.761 --> 20:40.896
Least you made that nice
and easy for me.

20:43.365 --> 20:44.766
Sorry I ran off, Pete.

20:47.336 --> 20:48.836
- I just...
- I know, mate.

20:51.739 --> 20:52.974
I miss her, too.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.013
Do you want an ice-cream?

21:01.015 --> 21:02.183
Now you're talking.

21:04.819 --> 21:06.886
In fact, I'll have
a candy floss.

21:06.888 --> 21:08.287
Make it big, yeah?

21:08.289 --> 21:09.790
Think Amy Winehouse.

21:13.294 --> 21:15.228
99 double cone, please.

21:18.265 --> 21:21.332
- Three quid.
- Oh, I've got no money.

21:21.334 --> 21:24.069
- Must have left my purse at work.
- Oh, isn't life a chore?

21:24.071 --> 21:25.904
- Can I owe ya?
- You can't owe me.

21:25.906 --> 21:28.139
Really? Come on, I'll come back
after my shift.

21:28.141 --> 21:30.874
What does that say there?
I earned this, award winning.

21:30.876 --> 21:34.812
Not award winning mug. I'm an ice
cream man, not a nice cream man.

21:34.814 --> 21:38.182
Money. You've got, what am
I meant to do with that now?

21:38.184 --> 21:40.017
- I'll have it.
- Will you?

21:40.019 --> 21:42.186
All right, okay.

21:42.188 --> 21:43.921
Oh, very chivalrous,
taking advantage

21:43.923 --> 21:45.091
of someone's misfortune.

21:46.092 --> 21:46.992
For you.

21:50.362 --> 21:52.962
All right, Romeo and Juliet,
can you crack on? We got queue.

21:52.964 --> 21:55.998
Can I have a double
cone and candy floss, please?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.401
What is it with
double cones today?

21:57.403 --> 21:59.302
And a flake,
as well, please.

21:59.304 --> 22:02.173
And a flake. It's no
wonder Britain's gettin' so fat.

22:13.884 --> 22:14.985
Oi!

22:16.086 --> 22:17.654
Thanks for the ice cream.

22:18.689 --> 22:19.754
It's all right.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.657
You shy?

22:22.159 --> 22:22.860
No.

22:26.729 --> 22:29.797
- Is that German?
- No, it's French.

22:29.799 --> 22:31.299
You been to France?

22:31.301 --> 22:32.933
No.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.204
I've been to Birmingham.

22:35.972 --> 22:37.907
Sit down then. Don't bite.

22:41.210 --> 22:42.843
What?

22:42.845 --> 22:43.913
Doesn't matter.

23:03.198 --> 23:06.134
My mom says you can tell a
lot about a man by his shoes.

23:07.402 --> 23:09.169
If he's still got his
favorite pair of shoes

23:09.171 --> 23:12.071
from school, he's loyal,
almost to a fault.

23:12.073 --> 23:14.240
If he's got more shoes
than you, could be gay

23:14.242 --> 23:17.242
and if he has trouble
finding a pair he likes,

23:17.244 --> 23:18.446
he'll never make a commitment.

23:21.282 --> 23:22.816
What about trainers?

23:24.952 --> 23:25.986
Trainers are cool.

23:27.488 --> 23:29.056
I'm gettin' new ones soon.

23:34.528 --> 23:36.197
Loyal and cool.

23:51.344 --> 23:53.477
Well, it's nice to meet you.

23:53.479 --> 23:54.380
Uh, Omar.

23:55.515 --> 23:57.548
I'll pay you back, Uh Omar.

23:57.550 --> 23:59.916
No, it's fine. Honestly, I don't
want the money.

23:59.918 --> 24:03.420
- Do you live 'round here? Are you a tourist?
- Tourist.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.256
Although I don't actually have
anywhere to stay yet, so...

24:06.258 --> 24:07.859
Homeless and chivalrous.

24:09.794 --> 24:12.195
When you find a place,
come and get your money.

24:12.197 --> 24:13.430
I work at Sea Planet,
you can't miss it.

24:13.432 --> 24:14.564
I don't want the money.

24:14.566 --> 24:17.032
You're havin' the money.

24:35.919 --> 24:38.454
I saved her, Omar. I saved Gran.

24:38.456 --> 24:40.589
Where's the case?
I tried to get it with my frame,

24:40.591 --> 24:42.991
but it just pushed
further and further out.

24:42.993 --> 24:44.859
I almost drowned, Omar.

24:44.861 --> 24:46.327
'Cause of you, 'cause
you left me.

24:46.329 --> 24:47.929
Our money's in that case!

24:47.931 --> 24:49.530
Who puts the money
in the case unless

24:49.532 --> 24:51.032
they're in a gangster film?

24:51.034 --> 24:52.102
I can't swim.

24:59.942 --> 25:01.977
This is both
our fault, yeah.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.414
Get the bag.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.112
Uncle Ray?

25:40.047 --> 25:41.248
Uncle Ray?

25:45.252 --> 25:46.619
Blimey.

25:46.621 --> 25:48.186
Handsome Dex let himself go.

25:48.188 --> 25:50.155
Uncle Ray, they're with me.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.558
Well, look who it isn't.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.892
Don't bother comin'
visitin' your old Uncle Ray

25:54.894 --> 25:57.162
- anymore, do ya?
- Well, I'm here now.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.929
Yeah, I'm having a clue
wanting something.

25:58.931 --> 26:00.132
That's not true.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.437
All right, it's a bit true.
Got a spot of bother.

26:08.274 --> 26:09.975
You know, I knew this
was going to happen.

26:10.976 --> 26:11.911
Which one was it?

26:13.612 --> 26:17.081
Which one of you randy little reprobates
has deflowered my lotus flower

26:17.083 --> 26:18.649
and got my niece up the duff?

26:18.651 --> 26:19.918
We haven't.

26:22.287 --> 26:23.554
They lost all their stuff.

26:23.556 --> 26:24.987
They just need
somewhere to stay.

26:24.989 --> 26:27.123
Ah, two damsels in distress.

26:27.125 --> 26:30.159
And you're their knight
in shining armor, Uncle Ray.

26:30.161 --> 26:31.429
We can pay for something.

26:35.266 --> 26:37.100
That is a massive fuckin'
exaggeration

26:37.102 --> 26:38.203
on the word something.

26:39.471 --> 26:42.106
I mean, I know it's a shithole,
but are you taking the piss?

26:43.073 --> 26:45.073
Anyway, I can't help you, lads.

26:45.075 --> 26:46.176
I'm booked out.

26:47.311 --> 26:49.546
Stacked up to the cleat hooks.

26:51.115 --> 26:53.617
They'd go right through
you, trust me.

26:54.718 --> 26:56.418
Want to wake up with
a big girly arm 'round ya

26:56.420 --> 26:58.422
and somebody callin'
you sweetheart?

26:59.323 --> 27:00.988
How about I ring your parents?

27:00.990 --> 27:02.990
No, that's all right.

27:02.992 --> 27:03.893
They're dead.

27:04.894 --> 27:06.227
Does this mean we're
going to have to go home?

27:06.229 --> 27:07.294
I don't have a home.

27:07.296 --> 27:09.163
Lad, hold your horses.

27:09.165 --> 27:11.634
All right, there's no
assholes here at the castles.

27:13.136 --> 27:15.171
Not like I can throw you
two out to the wolves.

27:16.139 --> 27:18.141
Besides, any friend of
Amy is a friend of mine.

27:19.475 --> 27:22.108
I got some what we're
using case of emergencies.

27:22.110 --> 27:23.145
20 quid a night.

27:25.548 --> 27:26.682
All right, ten quid.

27:28.684 --> 27:31.985
Well, damn then. Free it is.

27:31.987 --> 27:36.022
All right, it's not much, but at
least you'll be dry and warm and safe.

27:36.024 --> 27:36.924
Thanks, Uncle.

27:39.059 --> 27:39.960
I've got to go.

27:40.928 --> 27:43.329
Feeding the sharks tonight,
my first dive.

27:43.331 --> 27:45.032
Watch, mind yourself, will ya?

27:46.133 --> 27:47.634
You can't trust 'em.

27:47.636 --> 27:49.937
Little sharp teeth and
dark beady eyes.

27:51.105 --> 27:54.275
Reminds me of me ex-wife.
If sharks had poems.

27:55.576 --> 27:58.010
Good luck, lads.
You're going to need it with him.

27:58.012 --> 28:00.412
And don't leave us alone
next time, missy, okay?

28:00.414 --> 28:01.615
I won't, promise!

28:03.484 --> 28:04.385
Liar.

28:07.788 --> 28:08.689
So, did ya

28:10.724 --> 28:12.356
- sleep with her?
- No, no, no.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.158
I'm not with him all day.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.563
Of course not. I just met her.

28:21.099 --> 28:24.571
Right, come on then. Let's get
you both out of them wet clothes.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.148
You do think he's,
you know, safe?

28:37.583 --> 28:39.518
Well, he's lettin' us
stay here, isn't he?

28:41.420 --> 28:42.987
I don't like that, though.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.425
- No door.
- Well, we're just going to have to make do, all right?

28:47.493 --> 28:48.993
He's been kind enough
to give us a room.

28:50.261 --> 28:51.195
Evening boys.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.498
Just wanted to make
sure you're settled in.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.199
Yeah, we're fine, thanks.

28:57.201 --> 28:59.401
No assholes at the castles.

28:59.403 --> 29:02.805
We have to make sure all of our guests
are happy, even the freeloaders.

29:02.807 --> 29:05.710
Now then, the disaster.

29:07.177 --> 29:08.677
The dryer's playin'
up and your clothes

29:08.679 --> 29:10.546
are soppin' wet through,

29:10.548 --> 29:11.780
so there's no way
they're going to be ready

29:11.782 --> 29:13.448
for tomorrow morning.

29:13.450 --> 29:14.785
But, fear not.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.785
Ray to the rescue.

29:17.787 --> 29:21.157
I knew these'd come in handy one day.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.494
Just some odds
and sods that folks

29:26.496 --> 29:28.563
left here over the years.

29:28.565 --> 29:30.299
Just can't bring myself
what throw 'em out.

29:31.233 --> 29:32.399
Memories.

29:32.401 --> 29:33.302
Right.

29:34.670 --> 29:36.071
- Thanks.
- So,

29:38.107 --> 29:38.807
'til the morrow.

29:44.747 --> 29:47.683
Oh, and this is the only
toilet on this floor, so uh,

29:50.251 --> 29:53.286
don't get nervous if I uh,

29:53.288 --> 29:56.122
come once or twice in the night.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.825
Sweet Jesus.

30:36.696 --> 30:39.263
This is a fittin' sendoff.

30:39.265 --> 30:40.499
She loved it here.

30:42.435 --> 30:43.502
We should say something.

30:48.507 --> 30:49.642
Don't know what to say.

30:51.844 --> 30:52.745
Hey, lads.

30:54.379 --> 30:56.212
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

30:56.214 --> 30:57.647
You're not doggers, are ya?

30:57.649 --> 30:59.182
We been gettin' a lot
of that on the pier.

30:59.184 --> 31:01.353
No, we're just...

31:05.790 --> 31:08.491
- What's in that urn?
- Who are you? You F.B.I. or something?

31:08.493 --> 31:10.693
Don't be cheeky, son.
That's America.

31:10.695 --> 31:12.528
- Now, what's in that urn?
- Tea bags.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.764
All right. Have any room?

31:14.766 --> 31:17.299
Looks like to me you're
scattering ashes,

31:17.301 --> 31:20.702
and you need a permit to
scatter ashes on the pier.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.571
You hand it over, nice and slow.

31:22.573 --> 31:23.540
I love you, Gran!

31:24.742 --> 31:26.408
Gov!

31:29.780 --> 31:33.381
- What'd you do that for, you idiot?
- I don't know, I just panicked.

31:33.383 --> 31:36.685
- The sendoff was supposed to be special.
- What's your name?

31:36.687 --> 31:39.387
It's okay, Thornton.
These boys are here to see me.

31:42.592 --> 31:44.792
I was hoping to bump
into you two.

31:44.794 --> 31:48.996
I think I found your father.
I know it's a special moment.

31:48.998 --> 31:52.367
It reminds me of the time when I
first realized I've got a gift.

31:53.335 --> 31:56.469
I was studying for my nursing
exams and I was so stressed

31:56.471 --> 32:01.610
and wound up, drinking coffee and
that's when I first heard the voices.

32:02.577 --> 32:06.813
And they came to me, givin'
me the answers to my test.

32:06.815 --> 32:12.686
Now, it turned out, these voices weren't
medically qualified, so, I didn't pass my exams,

32:12.688 --> 32:16.255
'cause of what I'd written
about Hitler and the like,

32:16.257 --> 32:18.858
but I learned something that day

32:18.860 --> 32:21.694
and it was a very special
moment for me

32:21.696 --> 32:24.699
and I think this is going to be
a very special moment for you.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.502
Wow, um...

32:30.504 --> 32:32.604
I feel guilty that I doubted ya.

32:32.606 --> 32:36.209
You mustn't worry.
I just Googled Malik Chowdery, Blackpool.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.984
Well, maybe we
should just leave, yeah?

32:46.986 --> 32:49.322
Well, we can't
both leave now.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.226
I mean, he might
not even be inside.

32:58.564 --> 32:59.598
What's that?

33:01.734 --> 33:03.302
Oh, it's got a kick to it.

33:04.403 --> 33:05.904
It's Ray's, from the hotel.

33:07.806 --> 33:09.539
What's in it?

33:09.541 --> 33:14.845
Brandy, whiskey, creme
de menthe, absinthe, rum

33:14.847 --> 33:16.715
and a little bit of Ribena.

33:18.449 --> 33:19.450
He calls it liver failure.

33:20.718 --> 33:23.352
Should probably go to a
hospital at some point.

33:23.354 --> 33:24.553
Do you want a bit?

33:24.555 --> 33:26.422
No, I'm not touching it.

33:26.424 --> 33:28.424
Oh, because I'm going
to see me long last dad

33:28.426 --> 33:31.026
who I haven't seen
for my whole life

33:31.028 --> 33:33.095
I can't possibly drink
during the day.

33:33.097 --> 33:34.397
What are you on about?

33:35.500 --> 33:36.601
All right, give it here.

33:37.668 --> 33:39.634
More like it.

33:39.636 --> 33:40.604
Ugh.

33:41.505 --> 33:42.606
Oh, that's strong.

33:44.374 --> 33:45.907
On three, ready?

33:45.909 --> 33:47.776
One, two, three.

34:07.563 --> 34:10.498
It's a bit like Gremlins,
isn't it?

34:11.934 --> 34:13.002
Ramadan.

34:14.570 --> 34:16.503
It's uh...

34:16.505 --> 34:17.840
similar rules.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.908
Like, in Gremlins.

34:20.909 --> 34:25.112
Can't feed 'em until
after midnight

34:25.114 --> 34:26.915
and the same in Ramadan.

34:30.717 --> 34:31.920
Phoebe Cates.

34:34.722 --> 34:35.723
Shut up.

34:36.858 --> 34:38.489
Now.

34:38.492 --> 34:40.025
There are two
boys set on the sofa.

34:40.027 --> 34:42.061
- One of them says he's your son.
- Which one?

34:42.063 --> 34:44.696
- The brown one!
- Really, don't be like that.

34:44.697 --> 34:48.067
- I don't know who they are!
- Get in there until I think of something.

34:48.069 --> 34:49.101
What do you mean?

34:54.842 --> 34:55.873
- Go on, then.
- I am.

34:55.876 --> 34:56.975
- Say it.
- I will.

34:56.976 --> 34:58.477
- Now.
- All right.

34:59.545 --> 35:00.712
Right, you two, out.

35:00.714 --> 35:01.913
But we just came to talk.

35:01.915 --> 35:03.414
Nothing to talk about is there?

35:03.416 --> 35:04.849
Out, now.

35:04.851 --> 35:07.152
- Let me explain.
- What is there to explain?

35:07.154 --> 35:10.421
I think it's you that
needs to explain, mate.

35:10.423 --> 35:11.189
Excuse me?

35:11.191 --> 35:12.623
Right, you stay there.

35:12.625 --> 35:13.991
You, I need to speak to you.

35:13.993 --> 35:15.726
Get up, now.

35:15.728 --> 35:17.797
- Malik.
- I'm sorting it, come on.

35:22.101 --> 35:23.803
Okay, what's this all about?

35:24.836 --> 35:26.502
I think you're my dad.

35:26.504 --> 35:28.540
- I'm sorry, say that again.
- You're my dad.

35:29.608 --> 35:33.076
Well, you keep saying that,
but what I'm hearing is where's my dad?

35:33.078 --> 35:36.112
- Where's my dad? He's not here, is he?
- You're Malik Chowdery, yeah?

35:36.114 --> 35:39.949
- That's right.
- Yeah, so you knew my mum, Caroline Baker.

35:39.951 --> 35:43.889
You see, I can see your lips moving,
but what I'm hearing is.

35:45.856 --> 35:49.058
- Is it money you're after? You're trying to blackmail me?
- No, don't want your money.

35:49.060 --> 35:51.894
Okay, well let me just explain.
You've mixed me up for someone else.

35:51.896 --> 35:56.598
- The only thing you and I have in common is the color brown.
- Yeah, but...

35:56.600 --> 36:00.135
Now. Listen to me. This is
how it's going to play out.

36:00.137 --> 36:03.038
You are going to take the chuckle brother
over there and both of you are going

36:03.040 --> 36:07.175
to take your lies and piss off out of my
house before I call the police. You got it?

36:07.177 --> 36:11.078
- But I know you're my dad.
- Right! That's it! For the last time,

36:11.080 --> 36:14.183
I am not your dad! Now, go.

36:21.590 --> 36:24.258
This was a mistake, Pete.
We should go.

36:24.260 --> 36:27.995
- No, this, it ain't right.
- Please leave.

36:27.997 --> 36:29.431
You've pushed me to this.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.833
Think you better read that.

36:33.835 --> 36:37.203
- What's this?
- Exhibit A. The birth certificate.

36:37.205 --> 36:40.840
Oh, that's just some
cheap Photoshop jobbie.

36:40.842 --> 36:43.009
- Malik Chowdery.
- What?

36:43.011 --> 36:45.145
- It's got your name on it.
- Well...

36:45.147 --> 36:47.613
Why would it say your name?

36:47.615 --> 36:49.848
There are a million Malik
Chowderys in this world.

36:49.850 --> 36:52.651
You just married
the right one, that's all.

36:52.653 --> 36:53.686
Exhibit B.

36:53.688 --> 36:54.588
The diary.

36:55.990 --> 36:57.756
Sorry, can you all hear
me okay at the back.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.525
Yes, carry on.

36:59.527 --> 37:00.960
But, hang on a minute.

37:00.962 --> 37:02.196
Don't carry on.

37:03.663 --> 37:06.698
This is stupid. Look, you're ruining
my daughter's engagement party.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.700
Oh, it's fine, Dad, don't worry.

37:08.702 --> 37:10.235
See? What?

37:10.237 --> 37:11.602
Look, all right, forget it.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.004
You two out, now.

37:13.006 --> 37:14.906
- Malik.
- Mom?

37:14.908 --> 37:16.874
Let's hear what the boys
have got to say.

37:16.876 --> 37:18.543
Yes, Mom.

37:18.545 --> 37:19.744
Thank you.

37:19.746 --> 37:21.145
Diary extract.

37:21.147 --> 37:22.780
Holiday to Rhyl.

37:22.782 --> 37:23.948
Well, I've never been to Rhyl.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.986
- You did go to Rhyl.
- What?

37:26.920 --> 37:28.188
You brought me this mug.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.055
Well, okay, I've been to Rhyl.

37:31.057 --> 37:33.590
I'm a businessman,
I travel a lot.

37:33.592 --> 37:36.294
Met my Arabian prince
again at the ice rink.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.062
He's so good looking. I know
it's not enough to simply like

37:39.064 --> 37:41.932
the look of someone,
I know it's meant to be.

37:41.934 --> 37:43.967
It's the little things
like he can't function

37:43.969 --> 37:46.671
without a cup of tea and we
both look really good in brown.

37:48.073 --> 37:49.872
He shares my love
of Chesney Hawkes

37:49.874 --> 37:51.208
and he even gave
me some knickers

37:51.210 --> 37:53.009
from a damaged shipping
container

37:53.011 --> 37:54.277
which I thought was generous.

37:54.279 --> 37:56.779
Who the hell is Chesney Hawkes?

37:56.781 --> 37:58.182
Shipping containers, Malik.

37:59.617 --> 38:01.317
Family business?

38:01.319 --> 38:03.152
Damaged knickers?

38:03.154 --> 38:05.522
And finally, the photograph.

38:06.991 --> 38:08.891
- Well, it's you.
- What?

38:08.893 --> 38:11.060
- That is you, Malik.
- Let me see.

38:11.062 --> 38:13.095
- Isn't it, isn't it?
- No, no, let me have a look.

38:13.097 --> 38:14.996
Oh my God, Dad that's you.

38:14.998 --> 38:16.731
It's not... Give it here.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.235
Look, give it here.

38:27.344 --> 38:31.879
Okay, let me explain. No, no, no,
no, no, no, don't be like that.

38:31.881 --> 38:33.314
I can explain.

38:33.316 --> 38:34.948
Sara, baby, I can explain.

38:34.950 --> 38:37.787
Can you just, quiet please!

38:40.256 --> 38:40.956
Okay.

38:42.224 --> 38:44.291
- It's true, but...
- You bastard!

38:44.293 --> 38:45.726
I just...

38:45.728 --> 38:46.862
Ooh.

38:56.838 --> 39:00.407
- Explain.
- I'd only known you for a couple of weeks

39:00.409 --> 39:02.842
and it was just a fling, baby,

39:02.844 --> 39:04.177
and you know, we were young

39:04.179 --> 39:06.879
and it was a lifetime ago and,

39:06.881 --> 39:09.182
she was tall and blonde and...

39:09.184 --> 39:10.849
Wait, did you say blonde?

39:10.851 --> 39:12.185
Yeah.

39:12.187 --> 39:14.120
Our mom isn't blonde.

39:14.122 --> 39:15.856
Oh no, she's this one, here.

39:16.757 --> 39:19.658
- Yeah.
- No, our mom's Karen, the brunette.

39:19.660 --> 39:22.327
Well, I slept with
that one there.

39:24.031 --> 39:27.065
Curly blonde hair, tall.

39:27.067 --> 39:31.869
- Had a tattoo of a fox on the buttocks.
- A buttock fox?

39:31.871 --> 39:35.173
Our mom never had tattoos
and she was short, right?

39:35.175 --> 39:38.843
- Maybe it was a threesome you forgot about.
- No, I didn't have a threesome.

39:38.845 --> 39:41.011
- Sorry, a threesome?
- I don't even have the energy for a twosome.

39:41.013 --> 39:43.347
- So you had a threesome.
- No, I didn't, baby. I never did that.

39:43.349 --> 39:45.416
Firstly, you slept with a woman from
Rhyl with a fox tattooed on her ass

39:45.418 --> 39:46.817
and now you've had a threesome.

39:57.696 --> 40:01.465
<i>♪ Nobody I'd rather be ♪</i>

40:01.467 --> 40:04.736
<i>♪ I am the one and only ♪</i>

40:05.470 --> 40:10.708
<i>♪ You can't take
That away from me ♪</i>

40:15.247 --> 40:16.747
<i>♪ From me ♪</i>

40:29.026 --> 40:29.927
Just.

40:32.396 --> 40:33.897
Oi, come here.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.002
- Chill, bro.
- Come here.

40:47.810 --> 40:49.410
- You see in there?
- Yeah.

40:49.412 --> 40:50.978
That kid in
there is your son.

40:53.149 --> 40:54.382
Don't be ridiculous.

40:54.384 --> 40:55.251
Look.

40:57.052 --> 40:59.085
- No, please, bro, please.
- He's your son.

40:59.087 --> 41:01.254
Oh please, you take him.
Take one for the team.

41:01.256 --> 41:03.390
- What's wrong with you?
- Please, bro.

41:03.392 --> 41:05.694
- Get in there.
- Okay, just let me get my breath.

41:16.804 --> 41:19.104
Listen, mom, I didn't mean to run you
out, I just used my natural

41:19.106 --> 41:21.840
reaction when I felt like I was in
trouble, I don't know what I did.

41:21.842 --> 41:24.176
I didn't, I just always run.
I was going to come back, I promise.

41:24.178 --> 41:27.748
- I was just going to...
- Irfan. Not to me, talk to them.

41:30.151 --> 41:32.053
Okay, listen, little man.

41:34.989 --> 41:38.359
It was a one night deal, like,
ten nights tops, straight down.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.328
- Did you know about me?
- I swear down, I did not know that you even existed.

41:43.330 --> 41:46.499
If I did, I would have
done the right thing, bro.

41:47.467 --> 41:48.900
Move to Karachi or something.

41:48.902 --> 41:50.235
Irfan.

41:50.237 --> 41:51.137
Sorry.

41:53.106 --> 41:54.807
Okay, listen to me, mate, I...

41:56.042 --> 42:00.813
I remember, it was, it was
a ice rink in Rhyl, okay?

42:01.581 --> 42:04.014
I could barely stand
up when I saw your mom.

42:04.016 --> 42:05.918
She had the biggest pair of

42:07.019 --> 42:11.822
eyes I've ever seen in my life.
Massive eyes.

42:11.824 --> 42:14.826
They looked, she looked like she had something
wrong with her, they were that big.

42:16.961 --> 42:20.863
I was a useless skater.
You know, my balance is terrible,

42:20.865 --> 42:24.902
but your mom, she was
like an Olympic champion.

42:25.903 --> 42:31.407
- Then one night, just fell into her arms.
- Sounds romantic.

42:31.409 --> 42:34.043
No, I mean, like, I literally
fell onto her, yeah.

42:34.045 --> 42:35.511
Belly flopped right
into her face.

42:35.513 --> 42:36.913
Broke her nose in three places.

42:38.116 --> 42:41.486
- Oh.
- Yeah, then I took her to the hospital and,

42:43.186 --> 42:45.253
we did it in the disabled toilets.
I didn't even kiss her

42:45.255 --> 42:46.888
'cause her nose
was still mashed up.

42:46.890 --> 42:47.891
Irfan.

42:49.192 --> 42:54.229
- Okay, listen to me, so what was your name again mate?
- Omar.

42:54.231 --> 42:55.365
Listen to me, Omar.

42:56.932 --> 43:00.868
I promise ya, I gave her my address and
everything. I said to her, if you want

43:00.870 --> 43:03.471
To find me, you could find me, but maybe
she wanted to raise you on her own,

43:03.473 --> 43:06.608
I don't know, you know?
Maybe she's a feminist or something, but,

43:06.610 --> 43:10.110
from now on, yeah,
I promise you,

43:10.112 --> 43:13.914
double pinky promise you that I
am going to make it up to you.

43:13.916 --> 43:16.916
- 17 years of back payments would be a start.
- What?

43:16.918 --> 43:19.386
I'm broke, so. You're mental.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.221
I'm still in my overdraft, mate.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.023
Every time. Every time you get
it out of your pants,

43:24.025 --> 43:25.226
I get an earful.

43:26.529 --> 43:28.629
- You shouldn't have got me drunk then, bro.
- Well, you got...

43:28.631 --> 43:31.097
- You got the party's Sambucas out...
- I didn't tell you to put it...

43:31.099 --> 43:32.400
Irfan.

43:33.401 --> 43:35.134
Look, I'm sorry.

43:35.136 --> 43:37.136
We should leave.

43:37.138 --> 43:39.472
- We've ruined everything.
- Yeah, they should go.

43:39.474 --> 43:41.574
- No, no, no, you stay.
- They should, they should leave.

43:41.576 --> 43:44.544
Just stay where you are, okay?

43:44.546 --> 43:48.481
This is a proud day for us. It's
our daughter's engagement party.

43:48.483 --> 43:50.616
Nothing's going to ruin today.

43:50.618 --> 43:52.384
Tell the family we've
got guests for dinner.

43:52.386 --> 43:53.685
Get out, now.

43:53.687 --> 43:55.856
But, I don't want a son.

43:57.057 --> 43:59.959
Sorry. Sorry, bro. Sorry.

44:02.128 --> 44:03.497
You done got me in shit now.

44:04.631 --> 44:05.532
So,

44:08.167 --> 44:09.433
is your mom still fit, then?

44:09.435 --> 44:10.470
She's dead.

44:11.571 --> 44:12.638
Okay, worth a shot.

44:15.308 --> 44:17.208
Sara, why don't
you do the introductions?

44:17.210 --> 44:20.044
Okay, this is my beautiful
daughter, Nadia

44:20.046 --> 44:21.545
and her husband to be, Sadiq.

44:21.547 --> 44:23.481
And then we've got Romana,
my youngest,

44:23.483 --> 44:25.181
and then we've got Parveen.

44:25.183 --> 44:27.150
Parveen's an elective mute.

44:27.152 --> 44:29.119
She hasn't said a word in years.

44:29.121 --> 44:30.422
Have you, Parveen?

44:33.125 --> 44:36.061
Really got her, there.
She's a bloody weirdo.

44:36.962 --> 44:41.131
And then there's the uncles.
There's Mohammed and Abdul, sells used cars

44:41.133 --> 44:46.201
and then we've got Hasma and Imran
and Akeel oh and this is Grandad...

44:46.203 --> 44:52.374
and Grandma Sadiqa and Auntie Asam
and our wonderful mother, Tazim.

44:52.376 --> 44:53.310
Who's the white guy?

44:54.311 --> 44:56.011
- Kevin.
- Kevin?

44:56.013 --> 44:58.680
- Kev.
- Oh, Kev.

44:58.682 --> 45:01.717
- Oh, sorry mate, you just look a bit different.
- It's okay.

45:01.719 --> 45:04.522
Please eat, eat.
There's plenty of food.

45:06.256 --> 45:09.658
- So, you are from Bradford?
- By the shore.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.593
We just moved though, recently.

45:11.595 --> 45:14.595
We've never really
been anywhere.

45:14.597 --> 45:17.732
We used to live with our
grandma, but she died,

45:17.734 --> 45:19.133
so now it's just me and Pete.

45:19.135 --> 45:20.735
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

45:20.737 --> 45:22.370
When did your grandma die?

45:22.372 --> 45:24.240
- Last week.
- Oh.

45:25.341 --> 45:28.210
I've been comfort eating.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.335
Kev what are you doing?

46:31.337 --> 46:32.704
Ketchup with the meal?

46:32.706 --> 46:34.404
Kev, you know
you don't bring ketchup

46:34.406 --> 46:36.273
into a Asian household.
It's offensive, mate.

46:36.275 --> 46:38.475
- Sorry, sorry.
- We're going to have to start

46:38.477 --> 46:40.546
searching you before you come
into the house now, Kev.

46:43.215 --> 46:44.748
Ah, Sadiq.

46:44.750 --> 46:48.819
Sadiq Simbal Annan, from
Lahore, hey. Bilal and Isha,

46:48.821 --> 46:50.489
meet everybody.

46:53.792 --> 46:55.326
And who are these boys?

46:59.264 --> 47:00.198
- Me?
- Hum.

47:01.199 --> 47:03.399
Hey, Papa, do you right?

47:03.401 --> 47:04.569
Who are these boys?

47:06.004 --> 47:09.372
Okay, it's going to sound, it's a bit
of a weird story, but, Papa, this,

47:09.374 --> 47:12.510
- he's saying he's my son.
- What did you say?

47:13.477 --> 47:15.377
- It's my son, Papa.
- Your son?

47:15.379 --> 47:16.812
- He's saying he's my son, Papa.
- What the hell

47:16.814 --> 47:18.113
is bastard going on here?

47:18.115 --> 47:20.083
- Papa.
- Come out here.

47:23.220 --> 47:25.420
Okay, Papa,
what's the punishment?

47:25.422 --> 47:26.456
I'm not joking.

47:27.724 --> 47:29.457
Give me your credit cards.

47:29.459 --> 47:31.693
- Papa.
- Do as you're told.

47:31.695 --> 47:34.729
- Papa.
- I think I was a bit too harsh.

47:34.731 --> 47:37.498
You know, when I'm, I'm
strict, I'm really very strict.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.534
All right.
No Pleasure Beach for a month.

47:40.536 --> 47:42.536
But Papa, you know, I love Pleasure Beach.
I go there every...

47:42.538 --> 47:44.505
- All right, for a week!
- Papa, please.

47:44.507 --> 47:48.475
Sit down. He has had an illegitimate
child whilst being drunk.

47:48.477 --> 47:50.477
- Punish him.
- Yeah, and he used my name.

47:50.479 --> 47:52.278
That's just lads will be lads.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.783
I have to be tough.

47:55.718 --> 47:57.419
No Sky TV for three days.

47:58.420 --> 48:00.420
- What?
- I've spoken.

48:00.422 --> 48:02.157
- Papa.
- I've spoken.

48:03.625 --> 48:05.725
- This is bullshit!
- Irfan!

48:05.727 --> 48:07.594
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

48:07.596 --> 48:10.663
Boys, this is your
fault, you little prick!

48:10.665 --> 48:13.433
It's not little prick that is
at fault, you little prick.

48:13.435 --> 48:15.102
Leave me alone!

48:16.236 --> 48:18.437
I am going to confiscate
his Lego cards.

48:18.439 --> 48:21.406
- Saftar, sit down.
- Of course.

48:21.408 --> 48:22.507
- Please.
- Yes.

48:22.509 --> 48:23.777
Three days.

48:25.479 --> 48:30.651
Everyone. Please forgive my
son's bad behavior. Let's eat.

48:31.619 --> 48:33.752
I think maybe
we should go, yeah?

48:33.754 --> 48:35.754
Let's...
Well, just for five minutes.

48:35.756 --> 48:39.758
- Just...
- Let's get out of here as soon as possible.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.928
'Scuse me, have you,
have you got a toilet?

48:42.930 --> 48:46.530
- Yes, up the stairs, first on your right.
- Great stuff, thank you.

48:46.532 --> 48:49.134
- Are you okay to go on your own?
- Yeah, thank you.

48:50.436 --> 48:51.936
Hurry back.

48:51.938 --> 48:53.404
So, how was your flight?

48:53.406 --> 48:55.642
Absolutely uneventful.

49:23.467 --> 49:25.401
I wasn't going to take it.

49:25.403 --> 49:28.437
I just thought someone
might have lost it.

49:28.439 --> 49:31.006
I was going to hand
it in, although,

49:31.008 --> 49:37.514
probably best not to mention
it to anyone, just in case.

49:39.382 --> 49:41.786
So, which one are you again?

49:43.954 --> 49:44.854
The mute.

49:45.990 --> 49:50.658
- Right, and, but you can speak.
- You catch on quick.

49:50.660 --> 49:55.197
- So, why don't ya?
- I only speak to people who deserve my words.

49:57.801 --> 49:59.435
How old are you?

50:00.536 --> 50:02.003
Age is just a number.

50:02.005 --> 50:04.306
Yeah, but which number?

50:05.274 --> 50:07.374
I like the way you stood
up for your brother.

50:07.376 --> 50:08.842
Someone's got to.

50:08.844 --> 50:10.977
Strong. Sexy.

50:10.979 --> 50:13.346
Those are my middle names.

50:15.784 --> 50:19.452
Oh, careful with them, just
'cause they're prescription

50:19.454 --> 50:21.620
and uh, I mean, I've
got a warranty,

50:21.622 --> 50:25.458
but I'd rather not damage them.

50:25.460 --> 50:29.295
- I like a bit of danger.
- Well, I don't so I'm just going to take them

50:29.297 --> 50:32.934
off ya like that, there
we go, lovely stuff.

50:37.004 --> 50:39.705
So, why do you pretend
to be a mute?

50:39.707 --> 50:42.875
They don't see me anyway,
so it means I can operate

50:42.877 --> 50:45.947
under the radar, like a ninja.

50:48.482 --> 50:50.482
Your brother's
ready to leave.

50:50.484 --> 50:52.586
We're going to drive ya home.

50:57.090 --> 51:00.658
- What's going on?
- I'm just finishing me cig.

51:00.660 --> 51:02.626
Well, we don't allow
smoking in the house.

51:02.628 --> 51:05.831
Well, I'm near the balcony
which is basically outside, so.

51:07.100 --> 51:08.632
Could ya put it out, please?

51:08.634 --> 51:09.969
Yeah, fair enough.

51:11.704 --> 51:15.739
- Ow, bloody hell!
- Sorry!

51:15.741 --> 51:19.211
Parveen, want you
downstairs with your family.

51:23.082 --> 51:24.884
I've not finished with you, yet.

52:18.467 --> 52:21.401
<i>Let's have a look through the papers now,
and one of the biggest stories this week</i>

52:21.403 --> 52:24.537
<i>is the tragic accident at
the Big Cat Safari Park.</i>

52:24.539 --> 52:26.874
<i>A couple has
been eaten by lions</i>

52:26.876 --> 52:28.641
<i>after the balloon that
they had hired</i>

52:28.643 --> 52:31.178
<i>for a romantic trip
crashed into the...</i>

52:31.180 --> 52:33.646
<i>The boys are being
cared for by Social Services</i>

52:33.648 --> 52:36.115
<i>who are trying
to contact relatives.</i>

52:36.117 --> 52:38.518
You can't split them up.
I mean, they're inseparable.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.086
I mean, they've just
lost their mom and dad

52:40.088 --> 52:42.889
and now they're going
to lose each other.

52:42.891 --> 52:45.758
You're all right, boys.
You're with me, now.

52:45.760 --> 52:49.663
No one is going to split you
up while your Gran's here.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.846
Suppose I better say
thank you, then.

53:08.848 --> 53:10.850
Well, then, say it.

53:13.052 --> 53:14.785
- Thank you.
- You have to mean it.

53:14.787 --> 53:16.522
- I do mean it.
- What you thankin' me for?

53:17.757 --> 53:20.791
Sortin' out the guesthouse
with your uncle.

53:20.793 --> 53:21.694
Oh yeah.

53:28.134 --> 53:29.701
What you waitin' for?

53:32.504 --> 53:33.405
Come on.

53:34.106 --> 53:35.841
I'm coming.

53:46.084 --> 53:47.886
My dad wrote me that.

53:49.121 --> 53:50.753
I did the picture.

53:50.755 --> 53:52.124
I like to draw myself, so.

53:55.860 --> 53:56.961
What is it?

53:58.129 --> 54:00.097
- Is it a horse?
- It's me.

54:01.699 --> 54:04.199
- Oh. Umm...
- You sayin' I look like a horse?

54:04.201 --> 54:06.904
- No.
- I was only eight.

54:08.039 --> 54:12.007
You know what? I can see it, yeah,
it's the light. Yeah, it's the light.

54:12.009 --> 54:14.943
I failed art school,
so I forgive you.

54:29.159 --> 54:30.592
Think I'm going to go
back to Bradford.

54:32.028 --> 54:34.062
I think that would be a shame.

54:43.806 --> 54:46.075
- Where you going?
- Going for a paddle.

54:46.976 --> 54:50.145
- I don't like the sea.
- More reason for you to go in, then.

55:14.935 --> 55:16.801
What time do you call this?

55:16.803 --> 55:18.239
I just went out for um...

55:19.273 --> 55:20.173
Hey, we know.

55:21.074 --> 55:22.609
Here come the excuses.

55:23.310 --> 55:24.609
I couldn't sleep.

55:24.611 --> 55:25.579
Drinkin'.

55:26.713 --> 55:28.148
Can see, you know.

55:29.582 --> 55:31.782
- Dancin' on ice.
- What?

55:31.784 --> 55:33.987
- Shoes are all sandy.
- Of course they are.

55:34.887 --> 55:36.589
He reeks of pleasure.

55:38.358 --> 55:40.824
Are you yourself when you
lie to those you love?

55:40.826 --> 55:43.260
I just went umm...

55:43.262 --> 55:47.364
I just um huh wah...

55:47.366 --> 55:49.233
- You been out with him haven't you?
- Who?

55:49.235 --> 55:51.235
Desmond!

55:51.237 --> 55:52.735
Who's Desmond?

55:52.737 --> 55:55.139
Who is Desmond?

55:55.141 --> 55:56.308
Man a funny wife.

56:00.211 --> 56:02.213
Better to be single than
cheated on, mate.

56:04.649 --> 56:05.850
He's a nice boy, he's young.

56:08.987 --> 56:10.652
You're tossin' each other?

56:10.654 --> 56:11.990
I don't mind another
one of those.

56:16.127 --> 56:17.095
There you go.

56:18.829 --> 56:19.930
They're not for sharing.

56:30.307 --> 56:32.042
Be in the next room if
you need anything, Pete.

56:33.210 --> 56:34.111
Cheers, Ray.

56:56.232 --> 57:00.033
- You all right?
- Oh yeah, thanks for asking.

57:00.035 --> 57:03.036
- Never been better, mate, yeah.
- Pete.

57:03.038 --> 57:07.342
Ain't got a door, stuck pissin'
about upstairs, lost my frame.

57:09.244 --> 57:11.813
Woke up, you weren't there.
Anything could have happened.

57:15.450 --> 57:16.351
I'm sorry.

57:17.319 --> 57:19.285
I thought you'd left me.

57:19.287 --> 57:20.788
Why would you think that?

57:21.922 --> 57:24.725
I'd never leave ya,
and you know it.

57:27.328 --> 57:28.229
Where were ya?

57:29.897 --> 57:30.798
Just out.

57:35.102 --> 57:36.736
Are you all right?

57:38.205 --> 57:39.804
Yeah.

57:39.806 --> 57:41.072
I suppose so.

57:41.074 --> 57:42.242
'Night.

57:45.712 --> 57:46.412
Goodnight.

58:13.305 --> 58:14.206
What's up, fam?

58:17.142 --> 58:20.075
This place has got everything.

58:20.077 --> 58:25.384
I'm tellin' you, man. Bloke, this
is, like, the best shopping platform.

58:26.284 --> 58:30.486
Welcome to the first Pakistani
and Indian gift shop in Blackpool.

58:30.488 --> 58:32.922
Really taking advantage of both
the markets, you know what I mean?

58:32.924 --> 58:36.192
And one day, Omar, this
could be all of yours.

58:36.194 --> 58:37.259
See that?

58:37.261 --> 58:38.993
Electronic prayer mat.

58:38.995 --> 58:40.895
And look, got lights.

58:40.897 --> 58:43.332
There's a typo on it
as it says Blackpools

58:43.334 --> 58:45.534
so we got loads for free,
know what I mean?

58:45.536 --> 58:48.138
But, the number one
seller in this shop

58:49.039 --> 58:51.408
without a doubt, is this pen.

58:52.442 --> 58:54.442
Normal pen, right?

58:54.444 --> 58:55.345
Wait.

58:58.781 --> 59:02.115
Leaves more to the imagination, though.
It's classy, you know?

59:02.117 --> 59:04.785
We're a tack shop,
but we're not tacky.

59:04.787 --> 59:06.954
- So that's the key.
- That's really cool.

59:06.956 --> 59:07.890
Yeah.

59:09.024 --> 59:10.392
All right guys.
Let's have some fun.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.934
- Sorry if I got you in any trouble.
- Nah, listen, it's fine.

59:21.936 --> 59:23.337
Had one little tantrum,
I got it out,

59:23.339 --> 59:25.505
smashed some stuff up,
had a little cry.

59:25.507 --> 59:27.073
I'm all right now.

59:32.247 --> 59:33.848
He is really good.

59:35.416 --> 59:38.850
- So you still live with your parents, then?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.

59:38.852 --> 59:40.919
But I'm moving out soon, actually,
I'm going to get my own place.

59:40.921 --> 59:42.421
- Oh yeah, where you moving?
- Back of the garden.

59:45.326 --> 59:47.495
This is legally binding.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.469
She is beautiful!

59:56.603 --> 59:58.138
You do know that's a boy?

59:59.406 --> 01:00:02.041
My granddad always used to say
this thing to me, used to say,

01:00:06.045 --> 01:00:07.911
I don't know what it means, but,

01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:10.080
I think it means something like,

01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:13.884
Irfan, you got responsibilities.

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:15.519
Make sure you look after people.

01:00:15.521 --> 01:00:19.356
Now somebody tells me
it's your birthday.

01:00:19.358 --> 01:00:22.593
So this one is going
out especially for you.

01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:24.162
Oh!.

01:00:25.231 --> 01:00:27.198
By the way, bro, I want
you to have this.

01:00:28.434 --> 01:00:32.135
- Oh no, I don't want your money.
- No, I know, but it's like, for you to get

01:00:32.137 --> 01:00:34.003
some decent clothing,
'cause you look like

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.071
a freak right now.

01:00:39.144 --> 01:00:42.078
No, I'm not done. Piss off.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.079
I've got 30 quid in there.

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:45.216
<i>Bring it on.</i>

01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:55.991
There she is, boys.
It's the family crown jewels right there.

01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:59.328
It's the first car my dad bought when his
businesses started really popping off.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.563
No one's allowed
to drive it, but him.

01:01:01.565 --> 01:01:06.133
Anyway, boys, another gift
from the container gods.

01:01:06.135 --> 01:01:07.270
I want you to have it.

01:01:08.304 --> 01:01:09.904
Genuine Rolex, yeah.

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:11.105
That one's got a bit
of water damage,

01:01:11.107 --> 01:01:12.973
but it still works fine.

01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:14.275
It says Rulex on it.

01:01:14.277 --> 01:01:16.911
Yeah, it's like,
limited edition.

01:01:16.913 --> 01:01:17.645
Must be German or something.

01:01:17.647 --> 01:01:19.213
These are for us?

01:01:19.215 --> 01:01:20.116
Yeah.

01:01:21.317 --> 01:01:22.218
Thanks, Dad.

01:01:23.386 --> 01:01:24.354
It's cool, man.

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:29.623
If you don't want to be players

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.592
like me and my old man, yeah,

01:01:31.594 --> 01:01:34.060
you got to get yourself
one of these beauties.

01:01:34.062 --> 01:01:35.263
Do you hear that engine?

01:01:36.698 --> 01:01:39.568
Purrs like a kitten, ain't it?

01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:44.937
Hey, Irfan, shut the engine.

01:01:44.939 --> 01:01:46.972
It's not a toy.

01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:49.208
Sorry, Papa.
Just showing Omar.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:52.378
- We're so glad you decided to stay over.
- What?

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.980
Oh, I forgot to say,
my dad wanted us to, so...

01:01:54.982 --> 01:01:58.250
We don't want you boys spending
another night at that guest house.

01:01:58.252 --> 01:02:00.686
Mom, can Omar please stay in my room?
It'll be so much jokes,

01:02:00.688 --> 01:02:03.655
we'll tell scary stories in that, like
Goosebumps, you know, old school stuff.

01:02:03.657 --> 01:02:05.190
I don't mind, honestly.

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:07.158
Yeah, let the boys bond, huh?

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.330
Parveen, can you take Pete
to the guest room, please?

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:14.666
Hey, that's cheating!
You can't do that!

01:02:14.668 --> 01:02:16.134
It's only cheating if
you get caught, mate.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:17.435
You can't do, no,
no, you can't do...

01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:19.303
Are we getting forgetful?.

01:02:19.305 --> 01:02:21.975
Let's see what we have
right here. Alright, wait.

01:02:23.276 --> 01:02:24.675
On you mark, get set.

01:02:24.677 --> 01:02:25.645
Oi, you bastard!

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:04.447
You need to get out!
Get out, Get out!

01:03:04.449 --> 01:03:08.217
- Ah, get out! Get out!
- Is everything all right?

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:10.319
- Oh my God. Malik!
- Yeah?

01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:13.624
This is an invasion of privacy.
She should be on the register.

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:17.091
- What are you doing with my daughter?
- She climbed in with me.

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.660
- Dad!
- No, not dad.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.528
Look, I told you we
couldn't trust him.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.163
It's always the quiet ones.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.298
Everybody here!

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.366
No, not everybody.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:28.203
- Pete, what you doing?
- Nothing, she climbed in with me!

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:29.771
Now, can you all leave me?
I need to get dressed.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.639
Right, that's it. Nadia,
go and get my cricket baton.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.106
- I'm going to kill him.
- She's lyin'!

01:03:33.108 --> 01:03:35.409
She can speak, do it.

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:37.311
Do the sexy voice thing.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.581
- Go on.
- Parveen?

01:03:41.116 --> 01:03:42.783
Women can't be trusted,
right, Irfan?

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:45.152
Mate, I'm just watching this,
mate. Get the popcorn.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.454
She's lyin', I promise ya.
I didn't do her.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:51.325
Do her?
I'll bloody do you in a minute!

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.760
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Why is she even here?

01:03:53.762 --> 01:03:56.062
Of course she's here.

01:03:56.064 --> 01:03:58.264
This is Parveen's bedroom.

01:03:58.266 --> 01:04:00.299
Pete, Pete, Pete, you kinky kid.

01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:03.169
Bring it in lad.
Did you use the frame on her?

01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:20.554
I'm tellin' ya.
She's got you all fooled.

01:04:22.122 --> 01:04:23.023
Fake mute.

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:26.126
Easy, anyone can do that.

01:04:26.827 --> 01:04:28.627
Ah, Pete, you're
the sexiest man alive.

01:04:28.629 --> 01:04:31.431
Show me your bum.
And you're all conned.

01:04:32.366 --> 01:04:35.500
I suppose you've got to see it from
her point of view, though, ain't ya?

01:04:35.502 --> 01:04:38.670
There's a lot of sexual
frustration in this house

01:04:38.672 --> 01:04:43.707
and along comes some
young tottie, AKA me.

01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:45.843
No wonder the girls are going
to go weak at the knees.

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:47.611
I'm like, George Clooney
on a frame.

01:04:47.613 --> 01:04:50.113
Shut up, all right,
just shut up.

01:04:50.115 --> 01:04:51.517
I know why you're doin' this.

01:04:52.485 --> 01:04:54.317
You just can't stand to
see me happy, can ya?

01:04:54.319 --> 01:04:56.352
What are you on about?
It's not my fault.

01:04:56.354 --> 01:04:58.822
Always dragging me down,
always draggin' me back.

01:04:58.824 --> 01:05:00.125
You do it on purpose.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.326
You and your attention seekin'.

01:05:03.328 --> 01:05:06.362
- It's embarrassing.
- It's a genuine condition.

01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:08.164
Omar, do this. Omar, do that.

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:10.833
Omar, get me my frame.
Omar, get me a cup of tea.

01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:12.837
I am sick of it.
I am sick of you.

01:05:14.238 --> 01:05:16.472
Well, you know what?
I'm sick of you.

01:05:16.474 --> 01:05:18.675
Sick of you and your
perfect little world.

01:05:18.677 --> 01:05:21.744
Sick of you and your
one-day daddy.

01:05:21.746 --> 01:05:23.245
I'm your brother.

01:05:23.247 --> 01:05:24.746
How 'about showing
me some support?

01:05:24.748 --> 01:05:26.150
You're not my brother.

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.186
See, I left my brother
back in Bradford.

01:05:30.254 --> 01:05:31.820
I'm your carer.

01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:35.091
The only thing I don't
do is wipe your ass, yet.

01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:39.393
And you know what? He might be a
one-day daddy, but at least he's here.

01:05:39.395 --> 01:05:40.862
Where's yours?

01:05:40.864 --> 01:05:41.897
Oh yeah.

01:05:41.899 --> 01:05:43.431
He's dead.

01:05:43.433 --> 01:05:44.434
Least I have a dad.

01:05:55.878 --> 01:05:57.145
Pete.

01:05:58.715 --> 01:06:01.283
I didn't mean what I said.

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:10.657
Sleek cameras everywhere
these days, aren't there?

01:06:13.662 --> 01:06:17.530
- Oh, Pete. It's all right, we're here.
- Oh, good.

01:06:17.532 --> 01:06:20.432
- You called them?
- I was worried about you boys, I'm sorry.

01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:23.837
- We wanted you both to be safe.
- You've been very irresponsible, Omar.

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:26.271
Do you have any idea
how dangerous it is here

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:29.675
for a vulnerable disabled
boy like Pete?

01:06:29.677 --> 01:06:31.377
Get your things.
We're going home.

01:06:31.379 --> 01:06:32.444
I'll talk to you
both in the car.

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:33.714
We don't have any things.

01:06:36.384 --> 01:06:38.719
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:07:22.393 --> 01:07:23.894
Right, let's get started.

01:07:23.896 --> 01:07:26.495
The moon was shiny,
come closer to me.

01:07:26.497 --> 01:07:29.032
Come close, come on snuggle up.

01:07:29.034 --> 01:07:32.802
The moon was shiny and
very bright one night.

01:07:32.804 --> 01:07:34.637
Now then, Pete.

01:07:34.639 --> 01:07:37.606
This is the last photograph
of you all together.

01:07:37.608 --> 01:07:38.643
Oh, I'm filling up.

01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:43.979
This, this is the last
photograph of you all together.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:47.449
All right? There's a scrapbook
for you, sweetheart.

01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:51.753
'Cause I thought what you could do
is, you could keep all your,

01:07:51.755 --> 01:07:54.622
your treasures and your drawings
'cause you're so good at drawing.

01:08:25.054 --> 01:08:27.487
I didn't see him.

01:08:27.488 --> 01:08:29.957
I went all
up and down the sea front.

01:08:29.959 --> 01:08:31.890
Wasted 20 quid in petrol.

01:08:31.893 --> 01:08:33.560
Ah, he couldn't have gone far.

01:08:34.529 --> 01:08:37.563
I just feel bad. I feel like,
I think I've upset him.

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:39.432
- I didn't mean to.
- Ah, never mind.

01:08:39.434 --> 01:08:41.701
You did the right thing,
for a change.

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:44.469
Right, well I think
we're going to head off.

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:46.505
- What?
- Oh, it's a long drive.

01:08:46.506 --> 01:08:49.008
Might try a different
route back, actually.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:53.078
The 8583 holds the M55
and then of the...

01:08:53.081 --> 01:08:54.813
Yeah, all right, Ken.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:56.615
Come on, Pete, we're going home.

01:08:56.617 --> 01:08:59.350
- What about Omar?
- He's made it very clear

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:01.520
he doesn't want
to come with us, Pete.

01:09:01.522 --> 01:09:03.456
We can't just leave him.

01:09:04.925 --> 01:09:07.758
Look, Pete, I know this
is hard for you, pet,

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.728
but Omar belongs here,
don't ya think,

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.430
with his, with his own.

01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:14.965
I mean, Ken agrees,
don't ya, Ken?

01:09:14.966 --> 01:09:16.667
- Oh, well...
- You see? I mean,

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:18.502
you know, it's
the modern problem, really,

01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:20.069
isn't it? you know, try to
appease everybody,

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.906
you just end up with a mess.
I mean you've got your

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.774
community action group this,
and your integration that.

01:09:24.777 --> 01:09:26.810
It doesn't work.
You know, we've left.

01:09:26.813 --> 01:09:29.145
You know, stop moaning
about it and move on,

01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:32.149
- which is what we're doing now.
- Omar is a young boy.

01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:34.118
- He needs his...
- Look, I know what Omar needs.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.853
With the greatest respect,
he needs discipline,

01:09:36.854 --> 01:09:40.557
he needs consistency and possibly
some sort of, some sort of boot camp.

01:09:40.559 --> 01:09:42.892
You know, I'm sorry, this is
just not my problem any longer.

01:09:42.894 --> 01:09:45.094
You know, Ellen, we
could stay and help them

01:09:45.095 --> 01:09:46.763
look for Omar for
an hour or so...

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.966
Shhh, stop undermining me, Ken.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:54.002
Look, my brother took on a child that
wasn't his own and look where it lead.

01:09:54.004 --> 01:09:55.904
I'm not playing at
UNICEF any longer.

01:10:01.745 --> 01:10:03.045
It's not my problem any longer.

01:10:03.047 --> 01:10:06.083
Guys, guys, shut up, all right?

01:10:07.051 --> 01:10:09.051
Look, I'm his dad.

01:10:09.053 --> 01:10:11.119
I think I should bloody
well have a say in this.

01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:13.487
Sorry, I'm going to stop you
there. Did you just say dad?

01:10:13.489 --> 01:10:15.190
Yeah, I'm his dad.
I'm the big poppy now.

01:10:15.192 --> 01:10:18.426
- Big poppy?
- The big poppy, it's Spanish for dad.

01:10:18.428 --> 01:10:22.163
Look, all I can say is looking at the
stock he comes from, quite frankly,

01:10:22.165 --> 01:10:25.066
I can see why Omar is such a wayward child.

01:10:25.068 --> 01:10:26.100
- What'd she say?
- Child?

01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:30.739
Hey.

01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:38.044
Don't jibber jabber at me. I've just
took you for some sort of closure chump.

01:10:38.046 --> 01:10:41.748
- I'm not jibber jabbering.
- They just called you a cow in our language.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:45.585
Well, cows are very useful and provide a lot
of milk, so I'm not taking that as an insult.

01:10:45.587 --> 01:10:47.990
- Tell 'em Ken.
- She's not taking that as an insult.

01:10:53.728 --> 01:10:55.694
I just wanted to say sorry.

01:10:55.696 --> 01:10:56.697
It's too late.

01:10:57.865 --> 01:10:59.901
This is all your fault.

01:11:01.002 --> 01:11:03.638
I'll talk to them. I'll do it.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.843
Look, they bore me.

01:11:09.877 --> 01:11:13.711
They're not like me and you.
We have special bond.

01:11:13.713 --> 01:11:17.782
What's the point in having a life
if you're not willing to live it?

01:11:17.784 --> 01:11:21.920
What's the point in coming to
Blackpool if you can't have fun?

01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:26.893
What's the point in having a car

01:11:27.827 --> 01:11:30.462
if you never even drive it?

01:11:40.039 --> 01:11:42.639
Hey, my car!
They're taking my car!

01:11:45.978 --> 01:11:47.878
Bring me back my car!

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.782
They're takin' my car!

01:11:52.084 --> 01:11:53.582
My car.

01:11:53.584 --> 01:11:55.085
Yes, hello, police?

01:11:55.087 --> 01:11:56.986
Yes, a runaway boy and girl.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:09.131
No, look, ah!

01:12:09.133 --> 01:12:12.268
Help, help, help me!

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:14.103
Stop the car!

01:12:14.105 --> 01:12:15.006
Help!

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.641
This'll be a beautiful
end to our romance, Pete.

01:12:19.643 --> 01:12:22.577
How romantic will it
be to drown at sea?

01:12:22.579 --> 01:12:27.682
Life's story is all about
the perfect ending. Romance.

01:12:27.684 --> 01:12:30.584
Parveen, look, you
don't have to do this. Stop!

01:12:30.586 --> 01:12:32.553
We do.
It's our destiny.

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.091
Please, stop!

01:12:35.725 --> 01:12:37.558
I've got a better idea.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.694
Why don't go at town first?
Steal, loot stuff.

01:12:40.696 --> 01:12:42.264
It's what Bonnie and
Clyde would have done,

01:12:44.033 --> 01:12:50.204
- and then we can spend our last night on Earth together.
- Blaze of glory. How romantic.

01:12:50.206 --> 01:12:54.942
- Tonight's ours. We can do anything.
- Anything.

01:12:54.944 --> 01:12:57.311
- Harry Potter!
- I'm not Harry Potter!

01:13:00.249 --> 01:13:01.981
Get me out of the car!

01:13:01.983 --> 01:13:04.017
Harry Potter old friend!

01:13:17.232 --> 01:13:18.266
Pete.

01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:22.768
- Hello.
- Whoa.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:25.170
- It's going to be...
- They're massive, aren't they?

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:26.106
I suppose.

01:13:27.007 --> 01:13:28.974
He's adorable in the tank.

01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:34.980
When you get in,
they give you a nudge

01:13:34.982 --> 01:13:37.015
to let you know who's boss.

01:13:37.017 --> 01:13:39.917
- Don't you ever get scared?
- Naw, I like 'em.

01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:41.219
How big is that?

01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:42.686
Big fish.

01:13:47.393 --> 01:13:49.595
Is this safe?

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.564
Is there anything
you're not scared of?

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.380
I know something
I'm not scared of.

01:14:10.382 --> 01:14:12.115
Oh yeah?

01:14:12.117 --> 01:14:13.151
What's that?

01:14:14.652 --> 01:14:15.353
You.

01:14:17.155 --> 01:14:19.324
That's the one thing
you should be scared of.

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:59.860
That's spiky!

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:02.095
That really hurts! Whoo!

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:02.998
Shh.

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.469
Doesn't look
like anyone's in.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:19.146
Well, it's a special day,

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:20.347
'cause we just got engaged!

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.150
No, we're not, no, we're not!

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:27.487
We're not, we're not, we're not engaged.
We're not engaged.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.889
- I tell you what you need, love.
- The police?

01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:32.258
No, an engagement party!

01:15:43.937 --> 01:15:45.772
Okay, come on.

01:15:48.074 --> 01:15:49.307
Where are the lights?

01:15:49.309 --> 01:15:50.443
'Round there.

01:15:51.378 --> 01:15:53.013
Where is everyone?

01:15:56.283 --> 01:15:58.216
Kevin, it's me, it's me!

01:16:01.421 --> 01:16:02.886
You hit him with a flower pot.

01:16:02.888 --> 01:16:05.356
He had the cricket bat.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:21.140
Kev, you all right, mate?

01:16:22.107 --> 01:16:23.007
Kev?

01:16:24.909 --> 01:16:26.108
I'll call an ambulance.

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:27.011
Yeah.

01:16:27.946 --> 01:16:29.078
Kev.

01:16:43.328 --> 01:16:45.394
You're going to
make him a lovely wife.

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:50.131
Pete. Pete, are you all right?

01:16:50.133 --> 01:16:52.234
Come on mate,
it is smashing up.

01:16:52.236 --> 01:16:55.570
Hey, we're made now.
Frickin' brilliant!

01:16:55.572 --> 01:16:56.972
There's loads of them.

01:16:56.974 --> 01:17:00.342
Come on!
Come on, we're over here!

01:17:00.344 --> 01:17:03.578
- This is all your fault.
- Pete, I had no idea what was going on, all right.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.481
Omar. Omar. What's wrong?

01:17:06.483 --> 01:17:09.083
- I don't know.
- I told you from the very beginning.

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:10.284
I'm sorry, all right?

01:17:18.461 --> 01:17:20.930
Oh, you devil, you!

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.132
Come on,
dance with me.

01:17:26.134 --> 01:17:28.234
Omar, help me. She's mental.

01:17:28.236 --> 01:17:29.570
Have you got a girlfriend,
Kevin?

01:17:29.572 --> 01:17:32.038
- No.
- Do you want one?

01:17:44.352 --> 01:17:45.253
Hey, Bo.

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.058
Get out of here, punk.

01:17:53.394 --> 01:17:54.461
My car.

01:17:58.465 --> 01:17:59.433
My car.

01:18:03.037 --> 01:18:04.202
My car.

01:18:16.049 --> 01:18:17.984
Just cut the bullshit.

01:18:25.957 --> 01:18:28.426
Right, which one
of you is Parveen?

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.164
'Sup Omar?

01:19:08.632 --> 01:19:09.533
How you doing?

01:19:14.104 --> 01:19:18.473
Hey look, I got it, I got it fixed for you.
Well, I mean, not fixed.

01:19:18.475 --> 01:19:22.009
I've got it replaced, 'cause
we got loads of them replicas.

01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:23.179
No, thanks.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.654
You know what it is, bro?
I've never been a fan of contraception.

01:19:33.656 --> 01:19:36.289
I'm really bad with it.
I can't even spell the word,

01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:41.328
like what is it, like K-O umlaut,
is it umlaut? German word?

01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:43.098
- Are you here for a reason?
- Yeah, I am.

01:19:45.401 --> 01:19:49.101
I'm just saying I hate condoms. They make
my penis feel itchy and claustrophobic...

01:19:49.103 --> 01:19:50.404
You know what?
I don't want to hear it.

01:19:50.406 --> 01:19:52.037
Please, don't,
please, bro.

01:19:52.039 --> 01:19:54.039
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry, please.

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:54.942
Give me a chance.

01:19:58.379 --> 01:20:00.114
- Did your mom send you?
- No!

01:20:01.516 --> 01:20:02.450
Dad did.

01:20:04.252 --> 01:20:05.219
You're an idiot.

01:20:06.354 --> 01:20:09.422
Listen, bro, I know I'm
an idiot, okay? It's just...

01:20:09.424 --> 01:20:12.625
it's hard being a like,
living with the fact

01:20:12.627 --> 01:20:16.394
that I'm like, a dad
now, I can't even say it.

01:20:16.396 --> 01:20:18.496
Like it's, I look in
the mirror and I'm like,

01:20:18.498 --> 01:20:20.400
you're a dad, ugh.

01:20:24.037 --> 01:20:28.473
Okay, listen, bro. The thing is,
I've always been a joker, you know?

01:20:28.475 --> 01:20:31.611
Banter, I love a bit
of banter, but,

01:20:32.512 --> 01:20:34.077
people don't take
me seriously, man.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.513
They treat me like a child,

01:20:35.515 --> 01:20:37.551
so I act like a child, you know?

01:20:38.752 --> 01:20:43.587
I don't get respect from anyone 'cause
they always think I'm some clown,

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:46.625
but I'm a sad clown, bro.
Real sad.

01:20:51.197 --> 01:20:52.429
Just a failure.

01:20:56.367 --> 01:20:57.603
You're not a failure.

01:21:04.576 --> 01:21:05.477
Listen, bro.

01:21:06.711 --> 01:21:09.681
Me and my family would love
it if you come to the wedding.

01:21:15.587 --> 01:21:16.554
Why did you get rid of me?

01:21:18.322 --> 01:21:20.123
Listen, bro, I didn't
want to yeah, but,

01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:22.792
Malik just always puts me down.

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:26.194
He said you can't be a dad.
You can't do this.

01:21:26.196 --> 01:21:28.096
He went, it's not right,
it's not fair on you,

01:21:28.098 --> 01:21:30.465
so I thought best
just to you know,

01:21:30.467 --> 01:21:33.802
drop you off here and...
but it's not Malik's fault, man.

01:21:33.804 --> 01:21:36.136
It's my responsibility.

01:21:45.581 --> 01:21:46.649
What's this?

01:21:49.819 --> 01:21:53.454
I know you're probably going to say
no, and I understand that, but,

01:21:53.456 --> 01:21:56.423
if you get sick of this place,

01:21:56.425 --> 01:21:59.425
you're always welcome
back at mine, okay?

01:21:59.427 --> 01:22:03.665
You can come and come to the
annex and you can, you know,

01:22:05.367 --> 01:22:08.134
well, me annex, su annex.

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:10.537
I mean, obviously, there's going to
be chicks coming now and again, so,

01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:12.805
- you know what I'm like.
- No chicks come 'round.

01:22:12.807 --> 01:22:15.642
Yeah, no, no chicks come
'round, you're right.

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:17.410
This is what I mean
about the bullshit.

01:22:17.412 --> 01:22:19.311
I'm always talking crap.

01:22:19.313 --> 01:22:20.649
But you can see through it.

01:22:22.717 --> 01:22:27.185
Listen. Thanks a lot for just
hearing me out, okay?

01:22:27.187 --> 01:22:29.221
And I'm sorry, mate.

01:22:29.223 --> 01:22:31.492
Well, no, actually, I'm sorry,

01:22:33.527 --> 01:22:34.428
son.

01:22:38.799 --> 01:22:42.335
You're my son and I'm your dad.

01:22:45.204 --> 01:22:46.704
God, it's so soppy
I feel sick now.

01:22:46.706 --> 01:22:48.673
So soppy, isn't it?

01:22:48.675 --> 01:22:51.642
- How do you think I feel?
- Yeah, this being your dad.

01:22:51.644 --> 01:22:53.146
I feel sorry for you, mate.

01:22:54.614 --> 01:22:55.615
You're all right.

01:22:56.716 --> 01:22:57.617
Cheers.

01:22:59.752 --> 01:23:02.753
We used to have a thousand
piecer of Warwick Castle.

01:23:02.755 --> 01:23:05.324
I think it's in the loft, Ken.

01:23:06.826 --> 01:23:08.758
- Ken.
- Hmm?

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.493
That thousand piecer?

01:23:10.495 --> 01:23:12.564
- Warwick Castle?
- Yes, is it in the loft?

01:23:13.765 --> 01:23:15.734
Yeah, I think it is.

01:23:16.735 --> 01:23:18.737
You'd like that one, Peter.
It's a cracker.

01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:24.206
I might get an early night,
if it's all the same to you.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:25.708
Oh, yes, good idea.

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.378
Fresh for lessons
in the morning.

01:23:28.346 --> 01:23:29.647
Yeah, lessons.

01:23:35.453 --> 01:23:36.687
Put those in.

01:23:40.323 --> 01:23:41.824
Is Pete in?
I need to speak to my brother.

01:23:41.826 --> 01:23:43.726
Don't think you should
be 'round here, do you?

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:45.794
- Who is it?
- It's the window cleaner.

01:23:45.796 --> 01:23:47.395
Look, I need to speak
to my brother

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:48.931
and I'm not
leaving until I've seen him.

01:23:48.933 --> 01:23:50.732
Look, Pete is happy here.
Certainly doesn't need any

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.367
destructive influences
damaging that.

01:23:52.369 --> 01:23:54.435
It's okay, Ellen.

01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:56.706
- What do you want?
- I came to say I'm sorry.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.541
- And do you want to come live with me and my dad?
- Your dad?

01:24:00.543 --> 01:24:04.578
We've got an annex at the back of the
garden. It'll be like our own place.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.748
No, get him out, Ken. No,
he doesn't want to come and live with you

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.885
and your so-called dad. Ken!

01:24:09.885 --> 01:24:11.654
- Let the lad speak.
- What?

01:24:12.588 --> 01:24:14.254
- No.
- What?

01:24:14.256 --> 01:24:15.355
I'm up here.

01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:16.790
They've got things I need.

01:24:16.792 --> 01:24:19.528
Besides, he's your dad,
not mine.

01:24:20.562 --> 01:24:22.929
You hear that? Go on, clear off.

01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:26.699
Ellen, shut up.
Please, for once.

01:24:26.701 --> 01:24:29.537
- Just let them talk.
- Go on then.

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:36.811
It's time for me to grow up.

01:24:38.211 --> 01:24:41.449
It was always going to come a day
where we didn't live together.

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:43.450
Might as well be now.

01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:46.584
But the dog and the wolf.

01:24:46.586 --> 01:24:47.855
Just a story, Omar.

01:24:49.256 --> 01:24:50.357
This is real life.

01:24:51.558 --> 01:24:52.991
You sure?

01:25:13.312 --> 01:25:15.281
Everything all right?

01:25:16.348 --> 01:25:17.450
Just drive.

01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:41.305
Omar!

01:25:42.607 --> 01:25:43.508
Omar!

01:25:44.609 --> 01:25:45.509
Omar!

01:25:48.512 --> 01:25:49.413
Omar!

01:25:51.983 --> 01:25:52.883
Omar!

01:25:55.086 --> 01:25:57.621
Irfan, stop the car!

01:26:04.027 --> 01:26:06.460
I can't believe you were going
to leave me with them lunatics.

01:26:06.462 --> 01:26:07.998
Well, you were the one,
I thought you were going to stay.

01:26:09.465 --> 01:26:12.366
You're so slow on the uptake.
Did you not see me giving you the eyes?

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:14.604
They were right behind me,
I couldn't say anything.

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:17.338
Oh, and I'm definitely the wolf.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.875
You are not the wolf.

01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:21.711
Come on, let's go.

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:52.640
- Out.
- You scrub up well.

01:26:55.876 --> 01:26:56.777
Oh.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:59.446
You left that at Ray's.

01:27:01.081 --> 01:27:02.581
Amy gave it to me.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:03.851
I was too upset to read it.

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:08.720
Tell you the truth,
I was scared.

01:27:08.722 --> 01:27:09.957
Gran loved us, Pete.

01:27:11.457 --> 01:27:12.692
It's all right to miss her.

01:27:16.163 --> 01:27:17.831
I've got something
for you, actually.

01:27:22.735 --> 01:27:24.502
No, Pete.

01:27:24.504 --> 01:27:26.005
That's yours, Gran
gave that to you.

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:31.408
I know, I know she did,
but I wanted you to have it.

01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:33.044
I thought you could put
it in your scrapbook,

01:27:33.046 --> 01:27:35.046
with all our other memories.

01:27:35.048 --> 01:27:37.048
Everything in one place, yeah?

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:38.849
That's how it should be.

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:56.534
- Let's get inside.
- Good idea.

01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:01.203
I love you, man.

01:28:01.205 --> 01:28:03.606
I love you, too, bro.

01:28:20.157 --> 01:28:23.524
Hey. Everyone if I could just
have your attention.

01:28:23.526 --> 01:28:25.428
Attention, shut up!

01:28:26.496 --> 01:28:29.764
Okay, just want to say thanks to
everyone coming to the wedding.

01:28:29.766 --> 01:28:31.167
I had a really beautiful time.

01:28:33.702 --> 01:28:35.638
Single hotties, make some noise.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.840
It's a joke 'cause
I'm not into hotties.

01:28:39.842 --> 01:28:41.911
Like a little big younger,
not that young though.

01:28:43.545 --> 01:28:46.813
Just want to bring on
my son, Omar, you know?

01:28:46.815 --> 01:28:48.916
Just found out about
him a little while ago.

01:28:48.918 --> 01:28:50.651
Very proud of him.

01:28:50.653 --> 01:28:52.252
He's brought himself
a beautiful girl.

01:28:52.254 --> 01:28:54.822
She's got pink hair, so she
looks like a rude goer.

01:28:56.191 --> 01:28:57.625
Well done, lad.

01:28:59.128 --> 01:29:01.228
Just want to say to
the beautiful bride,

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.229
Nadia, my niece.

01:29:03.231 --> 01:29:06.666
There's still time if you
want just to do a runner,

01:29:06.668 --> 01:29:08.000
because, no for real though,

01:29:08.002 --> 01:29:10.269
'cause he's a loser. Okay?

01:29:10.271 --> 01:29:12.772
Want to say to Pete,
pick up Pete.

01:29:12.774 --> 01:29:14.941
I might need to,
you know, might need

01:29:14.943 --> 01:29:16.541
to borrow your frame after
'cause I'm going to be

01:29:16.543 --> 01:29:17.876
absolutely legless tonight.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:23.917
No worries, guys, no worries.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:30.722
Yeah, and I want to say to
my big bro, Malik, you know,

01:29:30.724 --> 01:29:33.925
we have, you know, he's
a good guy, he's a good guy.

01:29:33.927 --> 01:29:35.793
He's believed in me
this whole time, you know.

01:29:35.795 --> 01:29:36.928
Now and then he can be
a bit of a bastard...

01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:38.562
Wait, wait. All right.

01:29:38.564 --> 01:29:41.266
Thank you very much. Off.

01:29:41.268 --> 01:29:43.767
Thank you every much.
Thank you very, very much.

01:29:43.769 --> 01:29:45.004
That's my brother for ya.

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:50.274
Now that our grandkids
are getting married,

01:29:50.276 --> 01:29:52.979
I think we should
get married, too.

01:29:57.882 --> 01:30:00.017
So, I can talk now.

01:30:00.019 --> 01:30:04.120
Yeah, are you still as
weird now you can talk?

01:30:04.122 --> 01:30:06.589
Do you still think
I'm really fit?

01:30:06.591 --> 01:30:08.992
Yeah, you're really fit, yeah.
Yeah.

01:30:08.994 --> 01:30:12.829
- Meet me in the back in five minutes.
- Okay.

01:30:20.738 --> 01:30:22.171
Yip.

01:30:22.173 --> 01:30:24.273
Sadiq, Sadiq, your name,
you've got dick in

01:30:24.275 --> 01:30:26.608
your name, you're Sadick,
'cause your dick gets no action, bro.

01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:28.777
How can that be true?
You're a virgin.

01:30:28.779 --> 01:30:30.912
I'm not a virgin. How come I'm a virgin?
I got my son right there, bro.

01:30:30.914 --> 01:30:32.714
- Well, that's immaculate inception.
- Immaculate incep...

01:30:32.716 --> 01:30:34.582
that's a film, you idiot.
It's immaculate conc...

01:30:34.584 --> 01:30:36.351
I don't care. I live in the real
world. You live in film world.

01:30:36.353 --> 01:30:38.220
I live in the real world,
you live in film world.

01:30:38.222 --> 01:30:41.691
Seriously, please, I'm beggin'
you Just don't be a child.

01:30:42.925 --> 01:30:44.825
Please, don't be a
child, be a man.

01:30:44.827 --> 01:30:46.761
Yeah, okay, maybe that
day will come one day.

01:30:46.763 --> 01:30:47.962
That's not today, bro.

01:30:47.964 --> 01:30:49.296
You're a pig.

01:34:40.352 --> 01:34:42.187
May as well read it now.

01:34:55.232 --> 01:34:56.534
You're not going
to believe this.

01:34:58.168 --> 01:34:59.336
What?

01:35:03.374 --> 01:35:04.508
Your dad's in the Caribbean?

01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:05.906
