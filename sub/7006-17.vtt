WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:09.335
[coughing] We'd like to welcome you
back to Men's Cooking Week.

00:09.409 --> 00:13.573
And apologize for the hasty end
to our flambâ€š demonstration.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.849
Never soak your peaches in jet fuel.

00:20.286 --> 00:23.847
- Who would have thought?
- Obviously not you.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.084
Everyone knows the most
important words in the kitchen

00:27.160 --> 00:29.822
for a real man are ''can opener.''

00:29.896 --> 00:34.458
On the contrary, l often enjoy cooking
an elaborate home-cooked meal.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.867
lt's no surprise to find out
the real man does just the opposite.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.238
lt might be a surprise
to find out there's innovative chefs

00:44.310 --> 00:47.245
in Michigan coming up with
very creative combinations of food.

00:47.313 --> 00:50.771
Right. For example, this taste-tempting
beverage is a combination

00:50.850 --> 00:54.684
of two well-known ingredients.
lt's called ''Broccoloupe.''

00:56.990 --> 01:00.551
All right, let me guess.
Broccoli and antelope.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.861
This can actually graze on itself,
which is interesting.

01:05.965 --> 01:09.696
This is broccoli and cantaloupe.
And it's mm-mm good.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.863
Hmm. While this is working
its way through Al's system,

01:12.939 --> 01:15.100
let me tell you
about the company that makes

01:15.208 --> 01:18.109
this drink that combines
fruit and vegetables called Vruit.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.408
They get my ''vrote.''

01:21.948 --> 01:25.714
Now we'd like you to meet one of the
innovators in Michigan food industry.

01:25.785 --> 01:30.552
He's been combining unusual foods for
years. Give a warm welcome to Ray Pleva.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.682
[applause]

01:33.760 --> 01:36.126
- Ray, welcome aboard.
- Tim.

01:37.263 --> 01:41.131
OK, well, we're gonna see
what's the latest invention

01:41.201 --> 01:44.261
- from the Ray Pleva kitchen.
- Something really unique.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.304
[gasps]

01:47.640 --> 01:49.471
lt's a hamburger, Ray.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.636
What else did you invent down there?
Rock and roll? Shoes? Clouds?

01:52.712 --> 01:54.771
No. Just this.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.373
Well, actually, Tim,
this isn't a regular hamburger.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.783
Ray has mixed his beef with one
of Michigan's finest resources.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.015
Motor oil?

02:03.890 --> 02:05.448
No, cherries.

02:05.525 --> 02:09.689
Cherries and beef. You know, l have a
lot of creative cooking ideas myself.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.925
l bet l could combine some
unusual foods into a tasty treat.

02:12.999 --> 02:16.162
Hmm. l bet you l could
come up with kookier combinations.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.898
Well, it might be kookier,
but it wouldn't be edible.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.703
Yeah? What do you say we
hone our recipes over a week

02:22.775 --> 02:25.209
<i>and have a showdown
right here on Tool Time?</i>

02:25.278 --> 02:28.805
- How does that sound to everybody?
- [applause]

02:31.718 --> 02:36.155
Well, l... l have to remind you, Tim,
that l am a classically trained chef.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.655
You don't need to be trained.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.591
lt's putting ingredients together.
Any idiot could do that.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.026
Thanks a lot!

02:43.596 --> 02:45.928
Well, l wasn't talking
about your hamburgers.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.899
We haven't taken a bite.
Let's try it out.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.491
Yeah. Dig in.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.897
- Mm.
- Mm!

02:53.973 --> 02:56.999
Fruity, yet beefy.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.710
Just like Al.

03:50.029 --> 03:54.056
- [doorbell ringing]
- [Wilson] Coming.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.237
- Hi.
- Well, hidy-ho, neighborette. Come in.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.636
To what do l owe this delightful visit?

04:00.707 --> 04:04.473
l'm an idiot. l forgot to buy salt.
l need to borrow some for my chicken.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.943
Oh, and Tim needs some squid.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.073
Oh, it's for his
cooking contest... thing.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.641
Oh, oh, oh.
Well, l never keep salt in the house.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.086
But l got squid coming out my ears.

04:18.558 --> 04:22.187
Wilson, l don't mean to get personal or
anything, but why are you wearing that?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.321
Well, l know it's a tad unusual, Jill.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.127
But l just love the feel
of a nice terry cloth.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.963
- Oh! The helmet!
- Yeah.

04:33.039 --> 04:38.409
This is a prop l'll be using for my
upcoming show at Wayne State University.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.503
Really? You're performing?

04:40.580 --> 04:44.209
Yes, l am, for the annual
arts festival this Friday.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.151
l'll be performing
at the campus coffeehouse.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.654
l'm gonna be doing
a monologue on my life.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.057
This is so perfect. l mean,
your life has been so interesting.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.152
Now everybody else
gets to hear about it.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.960
Well, it's a little bit scary,
but l'm gonna bare my soul.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.127
l'm gonna start off with my tale
of a jousting injury in Scotland.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.467
l'm gonna segueway into the summer
l spent observing the mating habits

05:06.539 --> 05:07.801
of the mountain gorillas.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.169
- Cocoa and Herman.
- Mm-hm.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.805
Yeah. Nine-and-a-half weeks
of monkey love.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.677
Jill, would you
and your family like to attend?

05:18.751 --> 05:21.276
The most talented artists
in Detroit are gonna be there.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.117
Well, of course. We'd love to come.

05:23.222 --> 05:27.181
Oh, you gotta remember to tell them
about when you played craps with Gandhi.

05:27.293 --> 05:31.787
Oh, what a night.
The Mahatma lost his shirt.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.992
Well, here's your squid.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.595
Tell Tim if he wants really fresh ones,
l got them upstairs in the tub.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.841
[jazz playing]

05:42.909 --> 05:44.740
Watch your wallets.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.803
Do you have reservations?

05:47.914 --> 05:50.678
Lots of them.
But my wife made me come anyway.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.518
lt's under Taylor.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.889
- Oh.
- Come on, guys. Excuse me. Excuse me.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.790
Mom, these people look kind of weird.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.420
Well, they may look a little odd,
but deep down,

06:03.496 --> 06:06.056
- they're no different than you and me.
- Excuse me.

06:06.132 --> 06:10.228
Are you interested in helping to
overthrow regimes in the Third World?

06:11.437 --> 06:13.064
l'm eleven.

06:13.773 --> 06:17.334
Attention, everyone. The Campus Cafe
Arts Festival will now begin

06:17.443 --> 06:19.468
with our hostess, Elzina Harris,

06:19.545 --> 06:23.845
who will inspire us
with her life-affirming poetry.

06:29.355 --> 06:32.916
Die. Die!

06:33.025 --> 06:34.788
Die!

06:34.894 --> 06:37.055
Go on, die!

06:37.864 --> 06:39.388
You first.

06:42.969 --> 06:48.635
And now the country folk stylings
of Rambling Andy Koplowitz.

06:56.115 --> 07:00.449
<i># When it's
peach-picking time in Georgia</i>

07:00.520 --> 07:03.785
<i># It's apple-picking time
in Tennessee</i>

07:04.891 --> 07:09.021
<i># It's cotton-picking time
in Mississippi</i>

07:09.095 --> 07:14.123
<i># And everybody picks on me #</i>

07:16.702 --> 07:19.034
Why do you suppose that is, Andy?

07:21.174 --> 07:23.870
[yodeling]

07:38.891 --> 07:41.826
Sounds like Dad
when he gets hit in the groin.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.994
[music plays]

07:53.506 --> 07:55.997
What are they doing?

07:56.075 --> 07:59.101
lt's supposed to symbolize trying
to get out of the womb.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.284
You back off
or l'll break your water!

08:11.224 --> 08:14.352
And now an insightful monologue
from an exciting newcomer.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.555
l met him here when l took his class
on Celtic mythology.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.928
Give it up for... Wilson.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.126
[applause]

08:28.274 --> 08:32.107
Good evening. My name is Wilson.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.238
And l've been told
l've led an unusual life.

08:35.313 --> 08:38.010
Tonight l'd like to share my journey.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.847
So, come along, won't you?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.283
[bagpipes play]

08:47.527 --> 08:50.291
The year is 1 962.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.697
The place,
the misty moors of Scotland.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.133
This is good. Now, he is just a natural.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.933
Yeah. Well,
anything beats a dancing bag.

09:07.146 --> 09:11.082
l had been living with
the Mara Masai tribe for six months.

09:11.150 --> 09:15.712
But l had been unable to engage
their aged chief in conversation.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.653
l had all but given up hope,

09:17.723 --> 09:21.056
until suddenly l was summoned
to his death bed,

09:21.127 --> 09:24.995
where he whispered in my ear
the words l'll never forget.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.532
[speaks foreign language]

09:29.602 --> 09:33.561
Which, roughly translated,
meant ''Hidy-ho, neighbor.''

09:36.208 --> 09:37.971
So that's where he got it.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.604
And then we did the dance of death

09:41.681 --> 09:45.447
because the chief had died.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.212
[chanting in foreign language]

10:02.501 --> 10:04.969
l think we know what killed him.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.609
Oh, yuck! lt stinks.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.240
What disgusting concoction
have you come up with now?

10:17.350 --> 10:20.251
l reheated the pancakes
you made yesterday.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.046
They smell because
you've had them in the fridge

10:25.124 --> 10:27.456
next to weird foods
you're making for the contest.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.290
Oh, my God! What is that?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.025
lt's chicken with banana drumsticks.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.233
Hi, guys. The paper came
and they reviewed last night's show.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.033
Oh, good. Let me see it.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.564
''The Performing Arts Festival
opens at the Campus Cafe.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.807
<i>Who couldn't help but love Elzina
Harris's poem, Die, Die, Die?''</i>

10:47.880 --> 10:50.747
l! l!

10:50.816 --> 10:52.545
l!

10:54.553 --> 10:56.111
l can't believe he liked that.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.885
Oh, wait till you hear what he says
about the bag dancers.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.656
''The best fabric choreography
l've seen anywhere, bar none.

11:05.731 --> 11:09.098
The only low point of the evening
was the meaningless meandering

11:09.168 --> 11:11.864
of a pompous performance artist
named Wilson.''

11:11.937 --> 11:13.097
What?

11:13.172 --> 11:17.336
''These were obviously the words of a man
completely out of touch with reality.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.708
One wonders if Wilson has ever
stepped off his mountain top

11:20.780 --> 11:23.408
to go to a movie, a convenience store
or a sporting event.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.746
lf he wants to illuminate
the human experience,

11:25.818 --> 11:29.845
he should try living it like the rest
of us.'' He's gonna be devastated.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.446
Let me see that.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.763
<i>This critic doesn't know anything.
This guy panned Tool Time.</i>

11:37.830 --> 11:39.730
He said l was juvenile.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.671
Boy, smells good! What are you cooking?

11:47.740 --> 11:50.504
Bison sausage? Yakwurst?

11:50.609 --> 11:55.342
No, no, no, Tim. Just good old American
sausage. My strange food days are over.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.076
And mine have just begun.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.516
You've had practice living
the human experience.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.180
Me, l've gotta get down off my
mountain top and join the real world.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.781
You read that stupid review, didn't you?

12:06.859 --> 12:08.326
No, Tim. The critic was right.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.761
l've lost all touch
with what normal people do.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.732
See, Tim, l've gotta go
to monster truck rallies,

12:14.800 --> 12:17.166
buy fast food from the clown.

12:17.269 --> 12:20.796
Tim, l want to learn how
to crush a beer can on my head.

12:21.674 --> 12:25.440
That's not stuff you want to do.
That sounds like stuff l want to do.

12:25.511 --> 12:30.471
Well, l've decided that being a little
bit more like you wouldn't hurt.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.312
[grunts]

12:33.686 --> 12:36.052
- How do you feel now?
- l hurt.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.255
Hi, honey. How was your day?

12:46.332 --> 12:49.563
How was my day?
You want to know how my day was?

12:49.635 --> 12:51.398
Not now.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.433
l couldn't get any work done
because Wilson came over.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.477
He said that he wants
to be like everybody else.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.513
So he spent the whole day
glued to our TV set.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.104
<i>Did he watch Tool Time?</i>

13:03.182 --> 13:06.049
No, l said he wants
to be like everyone else.

13:10.055 --> 13:13.218
He's just like
a completely different person.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.453
Don't worry about it. He's spent
his life studying other cultures.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.394
Now he's just taking time to study ours.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.557
Well, l hate him like this.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.399
l mean, Wilson used
to be so evolved and sensitive.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.997
Now he's just turning into... you.

13:30.442 --> 13:35.709
Oh, my God! That's the biggest
bag of pork rinds l ever saw.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.715
l love pork rinds.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.613
Hey, guys!
What are you doing with that stuff?

13:42.688 --> 13:45.452
[Wilson] Attention, Value Club shoppers.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.652
l have just discovered
the joy of buying in bulk.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.389
Wilson practically
bought out the entire store.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.795
He bought a gross of toilet paper.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.766
[Wilson] Ah! And l brought you some.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.999
Oh, that's three-ply.
We couldn't possibly accept that.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.470
Well, l insist.

14:03.542 --> 14:07.444
l never realized how much easier it is
to buy toilet paper than make it.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.347
But you love making toilet paper.

14:13.419 --> 14:17.287
But who has the time
when there's so much TV to watch?

14:17.356 --> 14:20.257
- Wilson just bought a Montesushi 700.
- That's right.

14:20.326 --> 14:24.660
With cone filter, PlP,
surround sound and splendovision.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.290
[grunting] Oh, l love splendovision!

14:28.200 --> 14:31.567
Yeah, l'm gonna go set it up right now.
Thanks for hangin' with me, boys.

14:31.637 --> 14:34.606
Oh, speaking of which, Tim,

14:34.673 --> 14:37.574
would you like to come over
to my house tomorrow night and hang?

14:37.643 --> 14:40.134
l'm having the guys over
to watch a basketball game.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.271
What guys? You got guys?

14:42.348 --> 14:44.509
Well, actually, they're your guys.

14:45.684 --> 14:49.051
Benny and Harry, 8:00.
Be there or be square.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.754
Well, Tim, l think we've
lost the old Wilson forever.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.918
We might have lost the old.
But the new Wilson

14:55.995 --> 14:58.964
gave me enough toilet paper to last
for the rest of the afternoon.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.969
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

15:05.037 --> 15:09.770
Right. Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor! Woo-hoo!

15:09.842 --> 15:11.776
[applause]

15:17.783 --> 15:20.343
Thank you, everybody.
What a nice crowd you are.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.887
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l'm Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.</i>

15:22.955 --> 15:26.083
And, of course, you all know
my side dish, Al Borland.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.524
- [applause]
- Thank you.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.889
Well, we are happy as a bunch of clams,

15:33.966 --> 15:37.629
<i>pleased as punch to welcome you to
Tool Time's first Creative Cook-off.</i>

15:37.703 --> 15:42.140
Let's have a warm welcome
to our impartial judge, Benny Baroni.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.142
- [cheering]
- [theme music plays]

15:49.048 --> 15:52.279
Well, are you ready
to judge our creative concoctions?

15:52.351 --> 15:56.583
Yes, Al. l just cleansed
my palate with a light sherbet.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.818
OK. Well, the scoring
will range from one to ten,

15:59.925 --> 16:01.790
ten being a great dish.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.761
And one for anything
that requires a stomach pump.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.321
l'm familiar with the rules.

16:07.399 --> 16:10.300
All right. Well,
why don't you start with my entrâ€še?

16:10.369 --> 16:12.030
My pleasure.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.601
[Benny] Mmm.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.976
Savory, tangy...

16:21.046 --> 16:23.708
...a carbonated delight.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.010
l give it an eight.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.245
Well, thank you.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.184
Thank you.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.249
An eight? An eight!

16:33.325 --> 16:36.294
Try mine, huh?
Stick your fork into this.

16:49.641 --> 16:53.771
Ugh! Lumpy, noxious...

16:53.846 --> 16:56.337
...an insult to my colon.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.614
- l give it a minus two.
- Minus two?

17:01.653 --> 17:04.520
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

17:04.589 --> 17:09.550
Well, Tim, unless your drink gets
a ten out of ten, l think l've won.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.891
l have a lot of faith
in my lima bean smoothie.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.830
You're not supposed
to give away the ingredients.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.993
Oh, you know what
a sucker l am for lima beans.

17:18.069 --> 17:22.564
l've already cooked my lima beans.
Add a soupâ€¡on of secret ingredients.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.472
A little bit of cultured buttermilk.

17:24.542 --> 17:29.173
Ah, yeah.
And some baking powder just for froth.

17:29.248 --> 17:30.738
Tim, you want to be careful.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.785
Buttermilk and baking powder
can be a volatile mixture.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.549
Al, back off. l know what l'm doing. All
right. Now, just press ''frappâ€š'' for me.

17:46.298 --> 17:48.562
Hey, the Pistons just tied it up.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.398
Great. l've got 50 bucks
riding on this game.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.470
What's the spread?

17:52.571 --> 17:56.530
The spread
is a delightful aerosol cheddar.

17:56.608 --> 18:02.444
And the sample lady said it
had a shelf life of 45 years.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.580
The spread refers to the odds
in the final score of the game.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.813
Many times spectators would
have to give their clothes to the...

18:09.888 --> 18:11.515
<i>- [cheering on TV]
- What happened?</i>

18:11.590 --> 18:14.559
<i>[on TV] That was the most
incredible play I have seen all season!</i>

18:14.626 --> 18:17.925
Of course,
we didn't get to see it because

18:17.996 --> 18:21.363
somebody's blocking the TV... again.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.924
- [Wilson] Oh! Oh!
- How are those little pizzas doing?

18:24.002 --> 18:26.937
Coming right up.
Don't do the wave without me.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.209
ls it my imagination
or is Wilson more annoying than me?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.007
lt's close.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.849
Be patient, OK? He's just trying
to be one of the guys, all right?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.510
Well, if he doesn't stop yapping,

18:41.587 --> 18:44.852
the guys are gonna go over
to my house and watch the game.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.686
Listen to you.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.454
Rather than drink beer here
and burp up nachos,

18:49.528 --> 18:51.496
you want to be home with your wife?

18:52.598 --> 18:55.089
Well, if l said that, l didn't mean it.

18:58.437 --> 19:02.373
[Wilson] Ah, you know, Germany
has a distant cousin to basketball

19:02.441 --> 19:04.705
which is known as korfball.

19:04.776 --> 19:08.007
lt originated in the village
of Braunschweig which is in northern...

19:08.080 --> 19:12.642
Wilson, we can't hear you
and the announcer at the same time.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.117
[Wilson] Oh, l'm sorry.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.620
[turns off TV]

19:16.688 --> 19:20.215
Anyway, in the seventeenth century
in Germany, it was quite a...

19:20.292 --> 19:22.783
That's it! l'm out of here!

19:22.861 --> 19:25.022
- Me too!
- Guys...

19:25.097 --> 19:27.065
[Wilson] But what about the mini pizzas?

19:30.369 --> 19:32.929
Hey, Benny, Harry! Come on, guys!

19:33.038 --> 19:35.529
[Wilson] Oh, no. Let's face it.

19:35.607 --> 19:40.237
[sighs] l'm never
gonna be one of the guys.

19:40.312 --> 19:43.475
l'm just gonna be hopelessly pompous
and out of touch with reality.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.016
lt's about that review again, isn't it?

19:46.084 --> 19:48.416
He didn't know
what he was talking about.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.786
- A lot of people liked your show.
- But Tim, you don't understand.

19:51.857 --> 19:56.521
He didn't just criticize my show,
he criticized my life, who l am.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.462
Aw, come on, Wilson!
l've known you what, 1 5 years?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.362
You're a little different, you know.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.459
But you've always been really
comfortable with who you are. Huh?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.367
Well, just up until that review,

20:06.438 --> 20:08.531
l thought my idiosyncrasies
had some value.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.165
Well, they do have value.

20:10.242 --> 20:13.268
You know, what happened here
is you went out on a limb.

20:13.345 --> 20:16.246
You put your life on the line,
the battle zone. You're onstage.

20:16.315 --> 20:19.978
You gave it your all. And, you know,
so what? You got hammered.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.813
<i>Ever been hammered on Tool Time?</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:27.018
Well, this once l got
too close to some shellac and...

20:29.962 --> 20:32.829
No, no, no. l mean, have you
ever been hammered by a reviewer?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.991
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.968
Well, how can you
not take it personally?

20:38.036 --> 20:40.004
Hmm.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.200
l'm reminded of one of the
greatest entertainers of all time:

20:43.275 --> 20:45.641
Sammy Davis, Jr.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.271
He said, ''l gotta be me.''

20:52.284 --> 20:56.380
To think l've spent my entire life
studying the Greek philosophers

20:56.455 --> 20:59.015
and it all comes down to Sammy.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.489
When it comes to wisdom,
there's nobody like the Candy Man.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.461
Tim, l want to thank you
for not bailing out on me.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.834
[imitating Sammy Davis, Jr.]
Oh, man! Don't change, baby.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.064
l love you the way you are, man.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.732
l dig you, cat.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.003
l mean, cat,

21:19.077 --> 21:21.841
can you feel the love in this room?

21:21.913 --> 21:23.778
lt's thicker than clam chowder, baby.

21:29.721 --> 21:34.158
The problem l see is how to get rid
of a metric ton of pork rinds.

21:34.226 --> 21:37.354
Well, l hope the Value Club
lets me return some of this stuff.

21:37.429 --> 21:40.057
Although, l must say
l have become quite fond

21:40.132 --> 21:43.067
of some of these high-tech appliances.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.035
l think l'm gonna keep that stapler.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.764
Always living on the edge.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.370
What l do want to unload, though,
is this answering machine device here.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.640
You know, that thing
has been blinking all day.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.814
That means you have a message.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.151
<i>[on machine]
This is Stuart from the Campus Cafe.</i>

22:04.222 --> 22:06.383
<i>Your show has gotten
a lot of good response.</i>

22:06.458 --> 22:09.621
<i>If you're not already booked,
we'd like you to come back on Friday.</i>

22:09.728 --> 22:11.992
<i>- [beeps]
- All right!</i>

22:12.931 --> 22:15.263
Thank you, Stuart. l'd love to.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.365
He can't hear you.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.238
[yelling] Thank you, Stuart!
l'd love to!
