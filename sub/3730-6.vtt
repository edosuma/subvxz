Claire: Each of these kids

00:02.437 --> 00:04.305
- claims to have a friend named Drill...
- [Electricity crackles]

00:04.339 --> 00:07.338
- that no one else can see.
- Wes: Minx was not chosen at random.

00:07.438 --> 00:08.636
She was chosen because of my job.

00:09.238 --> 00:11.206
She does exactly what
this "Drill" thing wants.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.974
Drill's the one who brought daddy home.

00:13.008 --> 00:14.776
- Aren't you happy?
- Wes: Claire, he's not the same person.

00:14.811 --> 00:16.712
He is. He's just forgotten.

00:16.746 --> 00:19.715
It's pretty clear you and I
weren't friends before, were we?

00:19.749 --> 00:21.516
I have to go back to where it all started.

00:21.551 --> 00:23.117
The answers we need,
they're... they're there.

00:23.152 --> 00:25.186

Henry, where are you?

- [Thud]
- [Gasps]

04:14.428 --> 04:16.628
Hi.

04:16.726 --> 04:19.028
Henry?

04:19.062 --> 04:21.964
Did you have a good sleep?

04:24.534 --> 04:26.835
Henry?

04:26.869 --> 04:28.804
I know these kids.

04:28.838 --> 04:30.772
- They're Drill's friends.
- [Sighs]

04:33.175 --> 04:35.744
[Smooches] That's right.

04:35.778 --> 04:37.546
You met Minx.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.681
She came to the house.

04:45.976 --> 04:48.910
What about them?

04:48.945 --> 04:52.380
Why do you have their pictures?

04:52.414 --> 04:56.818
Because I am trying to get to know Drill

04:56.853 --> 05:00.789
and how he picks his friends.

05:00.823 --> 05:02.557
What about the others?

05:02.592 --> 05:06.160
What do you mean, "others?"

05:06.195 --> 05:08.629
There's more, mommy.

05:08.663 --> 05:11.265
Drill has lots of friends.

05:12.868 --> 05:15.136
[Sighs]

05:15.170 --> 05:16.937
Minx: I miss you, daddy.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.939
Wes: I miss you, too, sweetheart.

05:18.974 --> 05:20.475
How's everything there?

05:20.509 --> 05:22.075
You and your mommy having a good day?

05:22.110 --> 05:24.979
I guess so. Where are you?

05:25.013 --> 05:26.947
At work.

05:26.982 --> 05:28.916
At your office?

05:28.950 --> 05:32.520
No. No, I have to be somewhere else today.

05:32.554 --> 05:33.521
Where?

05:33.555 --> 05:37.157
Kind of far. In a special place.

05:37.191 --> 05:41.395
Special how? Like... Secret?

05:41.429 --> 05:44.697
I... I can't talk about it right now.

05:44.732 --> 05:48.335
Maybe later, when we're all together, okay?

05:48.369 --> 05:50.303
I have to go now.

05:50.338 --> 05:52.906
I'll be home as soon as I can.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.173
Okay, I love you.

05:54.207 --> 05:55.842
I love you, too.

05:58.846 --> 06:00.613

06:10.723 --> 06:12.324
Mr. Lawrence. Thank you for coming.

06:12.359 --> 06:13.659
There are very few people we could call

06:13.693 --> 06:14.960
under these circumstances.

06:14.994 --> 06:16.295
When we spoke on the phone...

06:16.329 --> 06:18.597
I... I know. You...
you thought it was a prank.

06:18.631 --> 06:20.566
[Scoffs] When you dedicate your life

06:20.600 --> 06:22.701

of the universe,

06:22.735 --> 06:24.736
you come across your fair share of crazies.

06:24.771 --> 06:27.039
[Chuckles] You could say the
same thing about politics.

06:27.073 --> 06:28.674
[Both laugh]

06:28.708 --> 06:32.978
Well... Are you ready to see it?

06:33.012 --> 06:35.280
I believe I am. Yes.

06:35.314 --> 06:37.983
This way.

06:49.027 --> 06:51.463
Extraordinary.

06:51.497 --> 06:54.932
Is it... Some kind of meteorite?

06:54.967 --> 06:58.236
We were hoping you could tell us.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.705
That blue...

07:00.739 --> 07:02.339
It... it's like nothing I've ever...

07:02.373 --> 07:03.574
careful.

07:03.609 --> 07:08.178
It seems to hold some kind of a charge.

07:08.213 --> 07:10.047
You've touched it?

07:10.082 --> 07:12.182
Yeah, in... in transport,
there was turbulence.

07:12.217 --> 07:14.685
- Mm-hmm.
- A-and...

07:14.720 --> 07:17.554
- And... What?
- [Sighs]

07:17.589 --> 07:18.655
It's hard to explain.

07:18.689 --> 07:23.127
It seemed like it was...
It was defending itself.

07:23.161 --> 07:27.063
[Scoffs] You do realize
we are making history.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.098
[Clears throat]

07:28.133 --> 07:30.567
History's already been made, Dr. Tully.

07:30.602 --> 07:34.203
This... Is about the future.

07:34.238 --> 07:37.507
But you'll have access
to whatever you need.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.309
All we ask in return are answers.

07:40.344 --> 07:42.946
Is it a weapon? A vessel?

07:42.980 --> 07:45.481
Where did it come from?
How did it get here?

07:45.516 --> 07:47.450
I'm sure I don't have to remind you

07:47.484 --> 07:49.785
how vital it is that until we know

07:49.819 --> 07:52.255
what we're dealing with here,

07:52.289 --> 07:55.891
we maintain complete and total
secrecy over the situation.

07:55.925 --> 07:57.693
- Of course, sir.
- Yes, sir.

07:59.996 --> 08:01.631
How's Henry?

08:01.665 --> 08:05.568
He misses you. He doesn't understand.

08:05.602 --> 08:08.403
[Sighs]

08:08.437 --> 08:09.705
- Sean, I...
- Thank you for visiting.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.674
I... I know they're...
they're not making it...

08:11.708 --> 08:13.142
[Breathes deeply] Easy.

08:13.176 --> 08:15.610
Yeah, of course.

08:15.645 --> 08:18.147
I wish I remembered...

08:18.181 --> 08:20.515
Us.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.287
It'll come.

08:25.321 --> 08:26.921
Don't worry.

08:29.492 --> 08:34.429
Sean, I need to ask you
something about your tattoos.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.898
Henry, he...

08:36.932 --> 08:39.400
He told me that there are other children

08:39.433 --> 08:44.338
who have been contacted by Drill.

08:44.372 --> 08:46.340
Whatever your connection
is to him, I was hoping...

08:46.374 --> 08:47.975
- I could help you find them.
- Yes.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.812
[Sighs]

08:50.846 --> 08:52.279
I'm sorry.

08:52.314 --> 08:56.584
Uh... My mind, it's...

08:56.618 --> 08:58.185
What is it?

09:00.288 --> 09:03.224
It's... it's just...

09:03.258 --> 09:06.860
This feeling.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.496
It's... it's like...

09:09.531 --> 09:11.031
A pull.

09:11.065 --> 09:12.699
Like one of your visions?

09:12.734 --> 09:14.434
No, this is different.

09:14.468 --> 09:15.902
This is like something is grabbing me

09:15.937 --> 09:18.939
from the pit of my stomach and pulling.

09:18.973 --> 09:20.607
When did it start?

09:20.641 --> 09:21.808
Last night.

09:21.843 --> 09:26.947
I haven't... I haven't
felt like this since, uh...

09:26.981 --> 09:28.914
Since the desert.

09:28.949 --> 09:31.251
Not since Mali.

09:31.285 --> 09:34.387
Wes...

09:34.421 --> 09:38.691
Went to Africa yesterday, to Mali.

09:38.726 --> 09:40.526
- What for?
- I don't know.

09:43.585 --> 09:45.620
Did he find something?

09:45.685 --> 09:47.386
I don't know. I don't know. I'll ask him.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.954
I... I got a message. I'm meeting him.

09:48.988 --> 09:52.090
Claire, whatever... whatever's
happening, promise me...

09:52.124 --> 09:53.291
promise me that you'll...

09:53.326 --> 09:56.595
you don't remember this about me.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.064
But I'm pretty good
at taking care of myself.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.200
That's not what I'm worried about.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.348
I'm glad you made it back, Wes.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.815
- I'm sorry.
- I was really worried.

10:17.850 --> 10:18.983
No, it's... it's... it's okay.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.852
I called Lena when I couldn't find you.

10:20.886 --> 10:21.986
It's all... Claire. It's okay. I'm fine.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.187
I just... I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm fine. Claire.

10:23.221 --> 10:26.758
- I hope she didn't think that...
- I'm okay.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.559
Look, I... I wanted to call you.

10:28.594 --> 10:29.894
It's just... the answers, they just...

10:29.928 --> 10:33.063
they just came so quickly.

10:33.098 --> 10:34.231
The answers to what?

10:34.266 --> 10:36.033
- Where the fulgurite came from.
- Wes...

10:36.067 --> 10:38.369
I... I found something
in the desert in Mali,

10:38.403 --> 10:40.504
something beyond incredible.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.706
It may be the key to understanding Drill.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.841
I mean...

10:44.876 --> 10:49.914
It may... It may explain
everything, Claire.

10:49.948 --> 10:52.716
You...

10:52.750 --> 10:56.052
- You don't seem to be...
- Because I knew.

10:56.086 --> 10:57.888
Sean... he told me that he felt something.

10:57.922 --> 11:00.524
Oh, of course he did.

11:00.558 --> 11:03.359
Okay. That he hasn't felt since
the desert... After his crash.

11:03.394 --> 11:04.694
And you believe him?

11:04.729 --> 11:06.262
Come on, Wes.

11:06.297 --> 11:10.099
You know as well as I do that
he's connected to this thing somehow.

11:10.134 --> 11:13.069
Yeah.

11:13.103 --> 11:14.770
What exactly did you find out there?

11:17.774 --> 11:19.742
What is it?

11:21.478 --> 11:23.946
I... I can't.

11:23.980 --> 11:25.915
I already said too much.
There... there... there are...

11:25.949 --> 11:27.548
you... you can't tell me?

11:27.549 --> 11:28.383
Look, there are people who I answer.

11:28.418 --> 11:30.616
It's not like the bureau
where we could just share.

11:30.617 --> 11:31.854
Oh, no. Don't pull that, Wes.

11:31.888 --> 11:34.690
- Don't big-time me like you are some...
- Okay, that's not what I am doing!

11:37.461 --> 11:39.929
It's... It's not what I'm doing, okay?

11:39.963 --> 11:42.597
I wish I could share this with you, but...

11:45.835 --> 11:47.970
You think you're in control of this thing?

11:49.572 --> 11:55.043
You think all the answers
just... just came together?

11:55.078 --> 11:59.380
You were led to Mali by a child.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.717
Your secretary's son,

12:02.751 --> 12:05.052
under the direction
of his imaginary friend...

12:05.087 --> 12:09.223
I'll let you go ahead
and guess what his name is.

12:09.257 --> 12:12.226
It's time you stop thinking
about what you found

12:12.260 --> 12:14.561
and start thinking about why you found it.

12:14.596 --> 12:18.665
Drill wanted it here for a reason.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.700
Someone better find out
what that reason is...

12:23.300 --> 12:25.100
- Before...
- Before what?

12:26.041 --> 12:27.274
Hmm?

12:27.309 --> 12:30.310
Before it's too late.

12:30.344 --> 12:31.979
[Car door closes]

12:32.013 --> 12:33.714
[Engine turns over]

12:35.911 --> 12:38.311
Claire: You want answers.
I can get them for you.

12:38.410 --> 12:40.377
You think a group of children
can tell us what happened

12:40.412 --> 12:41.846
in the meltdown at Harbor Point?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.080
I think they can tell us
a whole lot more than that

12:44.081 --> 12:44.780
if you will just let me talk...

12:44.781 --> 12:47.548
Claire, I can't put you back on this case.

12:47.582 --> 12:50.184
Think of who's involved...
your husband, your son.

12:50.219 --> 12:52.319
Because of what my son told me,

12:52.354 --> 12:54.655
we have already tracked down another kid

12:54.689 --> 12:56.457
who is involved in this case.

12:56.491 --> 12:58.492
7year old boy caused a car accident.

12:58.526 --> 13:00.694
The guy on his bike
was killed... A therapist.

13:00.729 --> 13:02.863
The kid said his friend Drill
made him do it.

13:02.897 --> 13:04.365
Put them in a room together.

13:04.399 --> 13:07.868
Our best shot at figuring out
what is really going on here

13:07.902 --> 13:09.870
is to get them to talk.

13:09.904 --> 13:12.139
What makes you so sure they will?

13:12.173 --> 13:13.807
That's what kids do.

13:13.841 --> 13:15.876
If one has a secret, it's...
it's easy enough to stay quiet.

13:15.910 --> 13:17.844
But when they're with their friends,

13:17.879 --> 13:21.281
secrets become very hard to keep.

13:21.315 --> 13:22.949
[Sighs]

13:22.984 --> 13:24.751
[Siren wails in distance]

13:24.785 --> 13:26.185
Would you give us a minute?

13:26.219 --> 13:29.656
Thank you.

13:29.690 --> 13:32.292
[Clears throat]

13:32.690 --> 13:34.390
Where's Wes Lawrence on all of this?

13:34.424 --> 13:36.826
At the D.O.D. Following his own leads.

13:36.861 --> 13:40.130
- He's not using you to run his game?
- No.

13:40.164 --> 13:45.234
No. Gathering the kids is my idea.

13:45.269 --> 13:48.371
But if we learn something from it,

13:48.405 --> 13:51.073
I will tell everyone that it was yours.

13:56.813 --> 13:59.915
You hold this here in house.

13:59.949 --> 14:02.384
Keep it small. Nobody else knows but us.

14:02.418 --> 14:04.186
Agreed. Thank you, sir.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.354
Uh-huh.

14:06.389 --> 14:07.256
Do you think you'll be able to get

14:07.288 --> 14:08.891
all the families to go along?

14:10.760 --> 14:13.062
Almost all of them.

14:13.096 --> 14:17.332
We're keeping it together. What about you?

14:19.268 --> 14:22.837
All I can do is keep Henry talking to me.

14:22.871 --> 14:24.506
As long as he's doing that,

14:24.540 --> 14:28.943
I... I figure maybe I have a chance.

14:34.883 --> 14:37.484
It's nice...

14:37.519 --> 14:41.122
Being able to talk to
someone who understands.

14:44.326 --> 14:46.427
I assumed you and Wes had...

14:46.461 --> 14:49.396
No, it's...

14:49.431 --> 14:51.232
It's not the same. He's not a mom.

14:54.469 --> 14:57.238
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to forgive you?

15:00.074 --> 15:04.344
I don't deserve your forgiveness, Lena.

15:04.378 --> 15:05.846
I'm not asking for it.

15:07.514 --> 15:09.983
Then why <i>are</i> you here?

15:10.017 --> 15:15.255
I am here because I am having
a discussion group

15:15.289 --> 15:18.591
with the other kids
who have been contacted by Drill

15:18.626 --> 15:21.294
to see what we can learn.

15:21.328 --> 15:24.330
I was h-hoping that you would let Minx...

15:24.365 --> 15:26.532
- Be one of your guinea pigs.
- No. No.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.168
It will just be a quiet conversation.

15:29.202 --> 15:31.003
The other parents
have agreed to participate.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.672
We don't know these people.

15:32.706 --> 15:34.507
I...

15:34.541 --> 15:37.810
<i>I</i> don't know these families.

15:37.844 --> 15:40.946
What if... What if the other kids

15:40.981 --> 15:42.281
plant something in her head?

15:42.315 --> 15:43.715
What if getting them all together

15:43.750 --> 15:44.984
is exactly what Drill wants?

15:45.018 --> 15:48.120
- Well, we don't know what Drill...
- Mommy?

15:48.155 --> 15:52.758
Yeah, um... Honey, did you need something?

15:52.793 --> 15:56.395
Can I watch TV? "The Red House" is on.

15:56.429 --> 15:59.063
Uh, yeah, sure.

15:59.098 --> 16:00.699
But just half an hour, okay?

16:00.733 --> 16:02.701
Okay.

16:12.678 --> 16:15.446
Look, I get it.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.183
You're the expert, and I'm just
some stay-at-home mom.

16:18.217 --> 16:19.818
- No, that has nothing...
- Claire.

16:19.852 --> 16:22.153
I know what's best for my daughter,

16:22.188 --> 16:23.454
and I'm not comfortable

16:23.488 --> 16:25.756
putting her in a room full of strangers,

16:25.791 --> 16:27.625
not when she's this vulnerable.

16:27.659 --> 16:30.628
We're all vulnerable.

16:30.662 --> 16:32.663
I'm sorry.

16:32.698 --> 16:37.468
Have your group, but Minx won't be there.

16:52.884 --> 16:55.485
[Door opens, closes]

16:55.519 --> 16:57.487
[Birds chirping]

16:57.521 --> 17:00.623
Frommer: So, uh, how are you
handling all this, son?

17:00.658 --> 17:01.958
Wes: Fine, sir.

17:01.992 --> 17:04.661
I reckon this is the closest you've come

17:04.694 --> 17:08.064
to knowing what it feels like
to face down the enemy.

17:08.098 --> 17:11.067
I have been fortunate in that way.

17:11.101 --> 17:13.869
Do you think it puts you
at a tactical disadvantage?

17:13.904 --> 17:15.405
I don't understand.

17:15.439 --> 17:17.039
Never having been in battle,

17:17.074 --> 17:19.308
do you think it puts you behind the 8-ball

17:19.343 --> 17:21.510
when it comes to running this operation?

17:21.544 --> 17:23.479
I think if it wasn't
for the work I've done,

17:23.512 --> 17:24.981
you wouldn't know there was a battle, sir.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.950
Touché.

17:27.984 --> 17:29.952
Well, I really, uh...

17:29.987 --> 17:32.788
I really just - wanted to congratulate you.

17:32.822 --> 17:34.590
Uh, when I first moved up the ranks,

17:34.624 --> 17:37.192
one of the hardest things for me
to learn was how to delegate.

17:37.226 --> 17:39.327
It seems you're way ahead of the curve.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.662
I don't follow.

17:40.697 --> 17:43.999
Well, allowing Claire Bennigan
to gather those children,

17:44.033 --> 17:48.003
ask them questions
about Africa, about Drill.

17:50.940 --> 17:53.074
Oh, I, uh...

17:53.109 --> 17:54.742
You didn't...?

17:57.046 --> 17:59.180
I'm sorry. I just assumed...

17:59.215 --> 18:01.349
No, we... We discussed ways
to gather intel. I just...

18:01.384 --> 18:05.020
See, see, see, uh, when you've
actually been in battle, son,

18:05.054 --> 18:08.956
you learn even your allies
need a little oversight.

18:08.990 --> 18:10.991
- I trust Claire completely.
- Well, I trust my brother.

18:11.026 --> 18:13.494
Doesn't mean I'm gonna let him
share a bed with my wife.

18:13.529 --> 18:14.630
I don't think Claire...

18:14.728 --> 18:17.565
Do you know who's gonna be there?

18:17.599 --> 18:20.735
Do you know the questions she's gonna ask?

18:20.769 --> 18:22.202
Is there a containment plan

18:22.237 --> 18:25.872
if there's any sensitive
material disclosed?

18:25.907 --> 18:28.642
Let's try that question again.

18:28.676 --> 18:33.414
How are you handling all this, son?

18:46.494 --> 18:47.461
Agent Bennigan.

18:47.495 --> 18:49.463
I'm just... one second.

18:52.967 --> 18:54.935
What the hell is going on?

18:54.969 --> 18:56.269
I was going to ask you the same question.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.770
This is exactly what I didn't want...

18:57.804 --> 18:59.105
Cameras, security measures.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.773
Who ordered all this?

19:00.807 --> 19:01.907
Wes: I did.

19:08.961 --> 19:10.929
[Keys jingling]

19:13.966 --> 19:15.434
Captain Bennigan.

19:15.468 --> 19:17.068
Yes?

19:17.102 --> 19:19.737
Do you know who I am?

19:19.771 --> 19:22.206
I'm Hailey Frommer, Secretary of Defense.

19:22.241 --> 19:24.409
I don't get a lot of visitors here.

19:24.443 --> 19:26.911
Well, you can't break
into a nuclear power plant

19:26.946 --> 19:30.048
and expect to be treated like a war hero.

19:30.082 --> 19:32.050
But I... I'm getting ahead of myself.

19:32.084 --> 19:37.020
Uh, tell me, Captain,
do you know how you ended up

19:37.055 --> 19:38.956
in the middle of the Sahara Desert?

19:38.990 --> 19:40.925
No.

19:40.959 --> 19:42.893
No recollection of the mission you were on

19:42.961 --> 19:44.194
when it happened?

19:44.228 --> 19:45.529
No.

19:45.564 --> 19:48.165
Hmm.

19:48.199 --> 19:50.467
All right.

19:50.534 --> 19:53.770
But you didn't come all this way
just to get answers

19:53.804 --> 19:56.873
you could have gotten
from my polygraph, did you?

19:56.907 --> 19:59.509
Why <i>do</i> you think I'm here?

19:59.543 --> 20:01.345
Because the walls here have ears,

20:01.379 --> 20:02.545
and they heard me ask my wife

20:02.580 --> 20:04.047
what Wes Lawrence was doing in Mali.

20:04.082 --> 20:05.548
So why don't we just talk about that?

20:09.052 --> 20:12.655
Don't push your luck, friend.

20:12.690 --> 20:15.959
The last man that showed me
this little respect

20:15.993 --> 20:18.461
is living out the rest
of his days in Gitmo.

20:18.496 --> 20:22.965
I just want to know
what happened to me, <i>sir,</i>

20:23.000 --> 20:26.668
and I have a feeling whatever
Mr. Lawrence is doing in Mali

20:26.703 --> 20:28.570
might get me some of those answers.

20:28.605 --> 20:31.107
So you and I both want the same thing.

20:31.141 --> 20:33.742
It seems we just have different strategies

20:33.776 --> 20:35.344
on how to get it.

20:35.379 --> 20:38.647
See you soon, Captain.

20:40.917 --> 20:43.385
[Knock on door]

20:43.419 --> 20:46.021
[Door opens]

20:46.055 --> 20:50.492
Claire: They're nervous.

20:50.527 --> 20:52.160
They won't open up in this environment.

20:52.194 --> 20:53.662
I know you. You'll draw them out.

20:53.696 --> 20:55.296
That's not the point.

20:55.331 --> 20:56.797
The point is you went behind my back.

20:56.832 --> 20:57.965
I gave their parents my word.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.267
If any of these kids know anything

20:59.301 --> 21:01.102
about what we're up against,
we need to make sure...

21:01.137 --> 21:02.437
that it's contained?

21:02.471 --> 21:04.506
You gonna lock them up in some
secret government site, too?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.840
I'm just trying to keep everyone safe.

21:05.874 --> 21:07.808
Do you really think I'd put
my own daughter at risk?

21:07.843 --> 21:10.778
[Chuckles] You need to call home more.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.079
Claire, don't.

21:12.113 --> 21:15.115
Your wife... She said no.

21:15.150 --> 21:19.820
I guess she knows you better than I do.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.425
We never should have agreed to this.

21:24.459 --> 21:25.927
Honey, please.

21:25.961 --> 21:27.428
Our son was cleared of any charges.

21:27.462 --> 21:28.429
It was an accident.

21:28.463 --> 21:29.896
They just want to talk to the kids.

21:29.931 --> 21:31.065
I'm sure nothing will happen.

21:31.099 --> 21:32.732
I don't even know why I'm here.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.701
I just posted something
on a mommy-and-me website

21:34.735 --> 21:36.370
about Jane's imaginary friend.

21:36.404 --> 21:38.205
Next thing I know, the FBI is calling.

21:38.239 --> 21:40.174
He's not imaginary.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.175
Excuse me?

21:41.209 --> 21:42.509
Trust me. He's real.

21:42.544 --> 21:44.478
Claire, you didn't
say anything about cameras.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.112
They look like lab rats in there.
What the hell is going on in here?

21:46.146 --> 21:47.614
- My daughter just has an active imagination.
- Please, please, please.

21:47.648 --> 21:49.082
Please. I understand
how you all are feeling.

21:49.116 --> 21:51.217
I seriously doubt that, Agent Bennigan.

21:51.251 --> 21:55.021
My son... he's in there, too.

21:55.056 --> 21:59.425
I know this is a lot more
than what we discussed.

21:59.460 --> 22:00.727
What exactly are we dealing with?

22:00.761 --> 22:03.362
I don't know. I... I don't know.

22:03.397 --> 22:05.731
But I am hoping that by bringing
the kids together,

22:05.765 --> 22:07.733
we can push everything out into the open.

22:07.767 --> 22:10.336
No more secrets.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.539
Do you promise us
that they are going to be okay?

22:13.574 --> 22:17.042
I won't let anything happen to our kids.

22:23.049 --> 22:24.617
Let's get started.

22:24.651 --> 22:26.952
Agent bennigan.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.587
Can I speak with you a moment?

22:28.622 --> 22:31.090
Yeah, of course.

22:31.124 --> 22:33.225
It's about my wife.

22:33.259 --> 22:34.726
How is she?

22:34.760 --> 22:38.863
She's completely recovered.

22:38.897 --> 22:41.198
The doctors, they're not sure
how it happened,

22:41.233 --> 22:44.035
but Harper says Drill did it.

22:44.069 --> 22:46.337
I... I don't know what to think.

22:46.371 --> 22:48.339
I know.

22:50.308 --> 22:53.277
When I say Amanda's better...

22:53.311 --> 22:54.578
Yeah?

22:54.613 --> 22:59.883
She's, um, having a hard time
being back at home.

22:59.917 --> 23:01.552
She's scared.

23:01.586 --> 23:03.320
[Sighs] She can't sleep.

23:03.355 --> 23:05.623
She wakes up every half-hour

23:05.657 --> 23:08.792
to make sure Harper's still in bed.

23:08.826 --> 23:11.094
Last night, she wanted to
lock the door to our room.

23:11.129 --> 23:12.763
It's killing her feeling this way.

23:12.797 --> 23:13.764
It's gonna take time.

23:13.798 --> 23:15.632
Yeah, but what if she's right?

23:15.667 --> 23:17.134
What... What if...?

23:17.168 --> 23:22.739
We... we can't see or hear this thing.

23:22.774 --> 23:24.407
So how in the hell
are we supposed to protect

23:24.441 --> 23:27.443
our children from something like that?

23:31.014 --> 23:33.149
I know Claire.

23:33.184 --> 23:36.619
She's the lady
who's gonna ask us questions.

23:36.654 --> 23:37.787
What kind of questions?

23:37.821 --> 23:38.688
About Drill.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.855
We shouldn't say anything.
Drill wouldn't like it.

23:40.890 --> 23:41.856
She's my mom.

23:41.891 --> 23:43.357
But she's not Drill's friend.

23:43.392 --> 23:45.326
Lucas: They think I did something wrong,

23:45.360 --> 23:48.329
but I seriously did not know
that man was gonna hit a car.

23:48.363 --> 23:50.631
<i>Now Drill doesn't want to talk</i>
<i>to me anymore.</i>

23:50.666 --> 23:53.334
<i>Maybe it's 'cause you turned.</i>

23:53.368 --> 23:56.003
Drill doesn't like it when we get older.

23:59.373 --> 24:00.841
What are you doing?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.843
You know that's not a mirror.

24:02.877 --> 24:04.812
This is how they watch us.

24:11.619 --> 24:15.088
Minx: Yeah, I like you a lot.

24:15.123 --> 24:17.757
You're my friend.

24:17.792 --> 24:19.258
Mm-hmm.

24:19.293 --> 24:21.594
You're for sure my best friend.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.370
Mommy said I couldn't go.

24:33.373 --> 24:35.507
Some kind of play group.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.843
[Static]

24:36.877 --> 24:38.744
I think they're talking about you.

24:47.510 --> 24:50.446
Claire: <i>We're just here to talk.</i>

24:50.480 --> 24:54.118
<i>If any of this starts</i>
<i>to feel uncomfortable,</i>

24:54.180 --> 24:56.447
or just not good,

24:58.380 --> 25:04.218
then you tell me, and we'll stop, okay?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.719
- Okay?
- Henry: Okay.

25:05.753 --> 25:07.854
Okay.

25:07.889 --> 25:09.823
Okay.

25:09.857 --> 25:11.491
Let's begin.

25:11.525 --> 25:14.427
But we've already talked to you.

25:14.462 --> 25:16.429
I know, Harper.

25:16.464 --> 25:20.567
I know, but I thought that it would be nice

25:20.602 --> 25:22.469
for all of you to meet one another.

25:24.171 --> 25:26.639
You're all Drill's friends.

25:30.677 --> 25:34.114
Does Drill know that we're here right now?

25:34.148 --> 25:36.616
I didn't tell him.

25:36.650 --> 25:38.418
Me neither.

25:38.452 --> 25:40.886
Drill doesn't like it
when we keep secrets from him.

25:40.921 --> 25:44.690
Claire: But Drill wants you to
keep secrets from your parents.

25:44.725 --> 25:46.659
Does that seem right?

25:46.693 --> 25:48.494
Jane: But Drill helped me.

25:48.528 --> 25:51.631
I used to be afraid of the night.

25:51.665 --> 25:54.433
My mom and dad, they own a restaurant.

25:54.467 --> 25:57.670
They work very late,
so our neighbor watches us.

25:59.639 --> 26:02.241
I'm afraid something bad will happen,

26:02.275 --> 26:05.477
<i>like they might not come home.</i>

26:05.512 --> 26:10.382
<i>But Drill promised me he'll keep them safe.</i>

26:10.416 --> 26:15.521
All I had to do was help you find your way.

26:15.555 --> 26:19.090
Drill said it was a treasure hunt.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.059
You helped me find my dad.

26:21.093 --> 26:23.261
Drill brought him back to us.

26:23.295 --> 26:27.732
He also made me hear again.

26:27.767 --> 26:31.502
When I was little, I got sick,
and I lost my hearing.

26:31.537 --> 26:35.072
After that, I was all alone in my head.

26:35.106 --> 26:38.142
I didn't like that.

26:38.177 --> 26:41.279
But then I heard this voice.

26:41.313 --> 26:43.914
It was the coolest thing ever.

26:43.948 --> 26:48.219
And now I can hear everything again.

26:51.622 --> 26:53.957
Harper: See.

26:53.992 --> 26:56.359
Drill just wants to help us.

26:56.394 --> 26:58.062
Why can't you see that?

26:58.096 --> 27:00.564
<i>I'm trying, Harper.</i>

27:00.598 --> 27:04.201
But because Drill
doesn't talk to grown-ups,

27:04.235 --> 27:06.503
sometimes it's hard.

27:08.506 --> 27:11.575
Why do you think that is?
Why won't he talk to us?

27:11.609 --> 27:14.578
It's her. Henry's mom.

27:16.681 --> 27:20.917
She's the one who doesn't like you.

27:20.951 --> 27:24.220
So I don't like her.

27:27.357 --> 27:30.793
She's the one who doesn't like you.

27:30.828 --> 27:33.096
Jane: Maybe it's because
grown-ups only hear

27:33.130 --> 27:35.098
what they want to hear.

27:35.132 --> 27:36.432
Drill doesn't like that.

27:36.466 --> 27:39.067
[Chuckles]

27:39.102 --> 27:42.037
But I'm listening to you now.

27:42.071 --> 27:46.041
I'm listening to all of you.

27:46.075 --> 27:49.645
Drill helped each of you get something.

27:49.679 --> 27:51.647
But what about him?

27:53.850 --> 27:55.650
What does he want?

28:00.123 --> 28:01.556
<i>Kelly?</i>

28:01.590 --> 28:02.891
Okay, this is it.

28:02.959 --> 28:06.194
Drill wanted something brought back here,

28:06.229 --> 28:09.131
something that he needed.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.431
Do you know why that is?

28:10.466 --> 28:12.099
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

28:12.134 --> 28:13.434
come on, come on, come on, come on.

28:13.469 --> 28:15.069
Does anyone know why?

28:15.103 --> 28:19.006
Maybe that was the thing
he was talking about.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.676
What thing, Harper?

28:26.582 --> 28:30.785
It's okay. You can trust my mom.

28:33.621 --> 28:37.323
He said he was sad.

28:37.357 --> 28:40.126
He misses his family,

28:40.161 --> 28:42.495
like I missed my mommy when she was sick.

28:44.198 --> 28:47.167
So there are others?

28:47.201 --> 28:49.468
Others like Drill?

28:49.503 --> 28:52.871
I think so, but they're not here.

28:52.906 --> 28:57.176
- [Electricity crackling]
- Drill had to come first.

28:57.210 --> 28:59.244
He had to find the food.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.815
[Static, crackling]

29:05.485 --> 29:07.652
Wes: <i>Claire?</i>

29:07.687 --> 29:11.223
<i>Claire!</i>

29:11.257 --> 29:12.457
Jane?

29:20.333 --> 29:21.666
What's happening?

29:21.701 --> 29:24.636
It's him. He's here.

29:24.670 --> 29:26.338
[Warbling]

29:26.372 --> 29:28.172
[Breathing heavily]

29:28.207 --> 29:30.208
<i>Claire, it's okay. We're coming in.</i>

29:32.645 --> 29:34.746
Harper: Don't be mad, Drill!

29:34.780 --> 29:36.715
We wanted to tell you!

29:36.749 --> 29:40.017
Stay right here. Stay together.

29:40.052 --> 29:41.819
Drill!

29:41.853 --> 29:42.820
Wes?

29:42.854 --> 29:43.954
<i>I'm scared of the dark.</i>

29:43.988 --> 29:45.422
<i>Wes, open the door, Wes.</i>

29:45.457 --> 29:47.424
- Open it.
- I can't. It's not working.

29:47.459 --> 29:48.992
We need to get them out of there right now.
[ <i>Indistinct shouting</i> ]

29:49.026 --> 29:50.160
Sir, you need to see this.

29:50.194 --> 29:52.730
<i>You didn't do anything wrong. Wes?</i>

29:52.764 --> 29:54.064
It's okay. Let's...

29:54.098 --> 29:55.399
we're scared, Drill.

29:55.433 --> 29:57.167
I swear, I didn't talk!

29:57.201 --> 29:59.236
Ethan... Ethan, you didn't
do anything wrong.

29:59.270 --> 30:00.636
None of you did. Shh.

30:00.671 --> 30:03.506
[Whimpering]

30:03.540 --> 30:05.041
What do you want from us?

30:05.076 --> 30:06.576
Why are you here?

30:06.610 --> 30:07.577
- Harper!
- Lucas!

30:07.611 --> 30:08.778
It's locked!

30:08.812 --> 30:10.580
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop, you're gonna scare them!

30:10.614 --> 30:12.382
[Muffled shouting]

30:12.416 --> 30:13.683
They're gonna open the door in two seconds.

30:13.717 --> 30:15.852
Your parents are right outside.

30:15.886 --> 30:18.688
Henry, Henry, what's going on?

30:18.722 --> 30:20.956
- Ethan: Stop crying!
- Is Drill here?

30:20.991 --> 30:21.957
What's happening?

30:21.992 --> 30:23.626
He's not talking to me right now.

30:23.660 --> 30:26.462
What about you, Kelly?
Is he saying anything?

30:26.497 --> 30:28.130
Wes: What is that?

30:36.506 --> 30:37.773
[Indistinct shouting]

30:37.807 --> 30:40.209
Step back! Step back! Please step back!

30:40.243 --> 30:44.479
Kelly, what is he saying?

30:44.514 --> 30:45.647
The door! Man: Open it!

30:45.681 --> 30:47.181
[Beeping]

30:47.216 --> 30:48.216
What's happening?

30:50.586 --> 30:52.387
Henry: <i>I hear him.</i>

30:52.422 --> 30:53.855
Mommy, he's here with me.

30:53.890 --> 30:57.158
Henry, is he hurting you?

30:57.192 --> 30:59.928
No, it... it doesn't hurt.

31:02.097 --> 31:03.898
Wes: What's it doing?

31:03.933 --> 31:06.401
Claire?

31:06.435 --> 31:07.568
Claire!

31:07.602 --> 31:09.003
- Harrison: Harper, honey?!
- Damn it!

31:09.038 --> 31:10.504
Lucas?! I'm right here!
Take it, take it, take it.

31:10.539 --> 31:12.206
Get back! Here we come!

31:12.241 --> 31:13.741
Oh, God.

31:13.775 --> 31:15.910
Harrison: Harper?! Honey!

31:15.945 --> 31:16.911
Ethan? Step back from the door.

31:16.946 --> 31:18.846
- Wes: Claire?
- [Electricity crackles]

31:18.880 --> 31:19.847
Harper... where is she?

31:19.881 --> 31:21.515
You okay? Henry, you okay?

31:21.550 --> 31:23.350
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:23.384 --> 31:24.685
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

31:24.719 --> 31:26.353
- Did you see anything?
- Yeah, we got it.

31:26.387 --> 31:27.688
Claire, we saw him.

31:27.722 --> 31:28.923
What do you mean, you saw him?

31:28.957 --> 31:31.592
On the thermal camera, he was...
he was with Henry.

31:31.626 --> 31:33.928
- Is he still?
- No, he's... he's gone.

31:33.962 --> 31:35.763
Do you know what this means?

31:35.797 --> 31:36.964
Kelly: Agent Bennigan?

31:36.998 --> 31:40.633
I have a message for you from Drill.

31:40.668 --> 31:42.635
Claire: What is it?

31:42.670 --> 31:46.306
He says you're not gonna win.

32:16.265 --> 32:19.033
What is he doing to my son?

32:28.209 --> 32:30.978
[Crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:31.012 --> 32:33.313
[Sobbing]

32:44.792 --> 32:47.727
What is this?

32:47.761 --> 32:50.564
That is what the children call "Drill."

32:50.598 --> 32:54.867
He or it appears to be some form of energy.

32:54.902 --> 32:56.703
That's why he's able to
manipulate electricity.

32:56.737 --> 32:58.238
Uh, sir, he's not...
he's not just manipulating it.

32:58.336 --> 33:01.438
One of the children said
he came here looking for food.

33:01.473 --> 33:04.441
That explains why there was
no radiation after the meltdown.

33:07.312 --> 33:09.579
He consumed it.

33:11.683 --> 33:13.784
Catherine: I think we have something.

33:13.818 --> 33:15.118
Wes: Well, I'm glad to hear that.

33:15.153 --> 33:18.588
We were able to extract
a core sample of the rock.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.924
The outer layers, they're known elements...

33:20.958 --> 33:24.394
Iron, nickel, iridium.

33:24.428 --> 33:27.096
But as we get closer to the inner layers,

33:27.130 --> 33:29.332
we can't determine the composition.

33:29.366 --> 33:32.001
We can assume that on its journey,

33:32.035 --> 33:35.471
it picked up various materials,
creating an outer shell.

33:35.506 --> 33:38.441
We can't pinpoint the exact origin.

33:38.475 --> 33:42.411
But given the presence
of aluminum and titanium alloys,

33:42.445 --> 33:45.380
we can at least posit the direction.

33:45.415 --> 33:46.982
Here.

33:47.017 --> 33:48.818
At some point during its journey,

33:48.852 --> 33:53.122
the rock passed through Chi Sagittarii,

33:53.156 --> 33:55.424
approximately 220 light-years from earth.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.593
So, you're saying whatever this is...

33:57.627 --> 34:00.395
it's definitely some kind of vessel.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.953
Dr. Tully?

34:24.987 --> 34:26.621
I'm getting something.

34:26.655 --> 34:28.255
What is it?

34:29.891 --> 34:31.525
It's emitting a frequency.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.828
It... It's weak, yes,
but can we get a visual?

34:41.436 --> 34:43.003
Wes: What am I looking at here?

34:43.036 --> 34:45.672
It's like it's calling someone, something.

34:45.706 --> 34:48.475
It's communicating.

34:48.509 --> 34:50.811
With who?

34:50.844 --> 34:52.110
Sir.

34:52.146 --> 34:55.815
We have a situation with Captain Bennigan.

34:55.849 --> 34:57.650
Looks painful.

34:57.684 --> 34:59.485
You're a hard man to get ahold of.

34:59.519 --> 35:01.487
Oh, my God, Sean.

35:01.521 --> 35:03.656
It's okay, Claire. Your husband
just wanted some attention.

35:03.690 --> 35:07.626
He wants answers, Wes.
I'd say he's entitled to them.

35:07.661 --> 35:08.794
We both are.

35:08.828 --> 35:11.463
What did you find in Mali?

35:11.498 --> 35:16.268
You brought something back, didn't you?

35:16.303 --> 35:18.437
Did you tell him?

35:18.471 --> 35:20.606
No.

35:22.342 --> 35:25.010
How do you know, Sean?

35:25.044 --> 35:26.912
How do you know?

35:26.946 --> 35:31.216
Because something is calling me.

35:31.250 --> 35:34.152
Are you gonna let me answer?

35:37.556 --> 35:39.157
[Static]

35:39.192 --> 35:41.193
[Laughs]

35:41.227 --> 35:43.194
Mommy, why is that happening?

35:45.030 --> 35:47.998
It's... It's just some static.

35:50.336 --> 35:52.804
Minx.

35:52.838 --> 35:55.139
I want to meet your friend Drill.

35:55.173 --> 35:58.475
Do you think... Could I talk to him myself?

35:58.509 --> 36:02.813
I doubt it. He only talks to kids.

36:02.848 --> 36:08.185
I know, but he likes games, right?

36:08.220 --> 36:10.354
I know I'm a grown-up,
but I'm a really good sport.

36:10.388 --> 36:14.024
That's true.

36:14.059 --> 36:16.693
How about this?

36:16.728 --> 36:18.962
We'll play a guessing game.

36:18.996 --> 36:22.399
You stand outside the door,
I'll ask the questions,

36:22.467 --> 36:24.401
and you tell me what he says.

36:24.435 --> 36:26.069
It'll be fun.

36:26.103 --> 36:27.637
I... I don't know.

36:27.672 --> 36:30.374
- [Whispering]
- [Electricity crackles]

36:31.842 --> 36:36.212
Mommy, Drill says yes.
He wants to play with you.

36:45.791 --> 36:48.726
So, your boss paid me a visit.

36:48.761 --> 36:50.028
Is that right?

36:50.062 --> 36:54.331
Yeah, doesn't seem like
a particularly forgiving man.

36:54.366 --> 36:57.168
You gonna catch hell for this?

36:57.202 --> 36:59.303
Mm, it depends.

36:59.337 --> 37:01.605
On what?

37:01.640 --> 37:04.007
If he finds out.

37:06.811 --> 37:08.745
You're married.

37:11.650 --> 37:13.417
Yeah.

37:13.451 --> 37:16.887
How long?

37:16.921 --> 37:18.421
Over 10 years now.

37:18.455 --> 37:20.891
You were young.

37:20.925 --> 37:23.894
We were.

37:23.928 --> 37:26.362
What's her name?

37:26.397 --> 37:29.032
Lena.

37:29.067 --> 37:30.834
Any kids?

37:30.868 --> 37:33.804
I... I have a daughter.

37:33.838 --> 37:36.472
She's 8.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.773
That's right.

37:37.808 --> 37:40.443
You mentioned her before.

37:40.477 --> 37:43.079
"Minx," wasn't it?

37:43.113 --> 37:45.915
Yeah.

37:45.949 --> 37:47.717
And she's caught up in all this, too.

37:47.751 --> 37:50.220
[Sighs]

37:50.254 --> 37:53.022
Looks like we have something in common.

38:06.536 --> 38:08.970
Okay, Minx.

38:09.004 --> 38:10.472
Uh...

38:13.976 --> 38:17.579
Ask Drill how many fingers I'm holding up.

38:17.614 --> 38:19.914
[Whispering]

38:19.949 --> 38:21.583
Three.

38:25.154 --> 38:27.288
Drill says to keep going.

38:34.930 --> 38:37.031
What am I holding in my hand?

38:37.066 --> 38:38.867
[Whispering]

38:38.901 --> 38:40.201
My headband.

38:40.236 --> 38:43.971
- [Electricity crackles]
- [Whispering]

38:44.906 --> 38:46.140
Good news, mommy.

38:46.174 --> 38:48.309
Drill likes you.
He says you can play with us.
