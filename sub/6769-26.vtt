00:08.173 --> 00:09.426
{\an3}What seems to
be the trouble?

00:09.509 --> 00:10.593
There's no trouble.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.429
{\an1}LOC two minutes, vitals are
stable, no history of trauma.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.305
Look, I don't even know
why I'm here, all right?

00:14.389 --> 00:15.765
Why don't you tell
me what happened?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.058
Nothing happened.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.268
She collapsed.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.561
I fainted. I fainted.

00:19.644 --> 00:21.271
Did you hit
No, I didn't hit my head.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.731

AreNo, I'm not.t?

00:24.357 --> 00:25.608
Look it, I have to go.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.402
{\an3}You were unconscious
for two minutes.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.404
{\an3}I want to run some blood tests
and monitor you overnight

00:29.487 --> 00:30.613
to find out why.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.406
{\an1}Did you hear what I said?
I have to go.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.616
{\an3}Two minutes is
a long time.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.076
If I were you, I'd
want to know why.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.997
I want a CBC, chem panel,
tox screen and ETOH level.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.498
I'll check in later.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.587
{\an1}DAVID:
What?

00:45.670 --> 00:47.464
Gina, I thought you were dead.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.465
Well, obviously, I'm not.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.674
I got scLook,

00:49.758 --> 00:51.176
I am not staying here,
all right?

00:51.259 --> 00:52.677
I don't need needles
stuck in my arm.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.928
And I don't need
any blood tests.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.305
And I definitely don't need

00:55.388 --> 00:56.473
{\an3}you taking
care of me.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.558
Fine. I'm just trying to help.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.274
So, what do you think?

01:06.357 --> 01:10.195
If that's the message you want
to put out there, be my guest.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.279
Oh, well, that's...

01:11.362 --> 01:13.364
Thanks for your help.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.328
Kel, what happened to you
was a crime of violence,

01:18.411 --> 01:19.287
{\an3}not of sex.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.123
It wasn't about wearing
provocative dresses.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.876
{\an3}It wasn't
anything you did.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.296
You know, I saw Matt outside.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.048
He told me he misses you.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.467
Yeah, I saw him, too.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.804
I just don't know
what to say to him.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.222
He'll understand.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.558
I just don't want him to know.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.520
You know, I don't want him...

01:43.603 --> 01:45.021
(sighs)

01:45.104 --> 01:46.773
I don't know
what I want anymore.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.066
He loves you.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.901
What happened is
not gonna change that.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.277
Yeah.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.197
I'm gonna go for a walk,
you know, to the beach.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.031
Okay, I'll come with.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.952
No, I'll Donna,lose up.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.411
I want to be alone.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.330
{\an1}Okay?

02:03.456 --> 02:06.042
Matt's gonna want
to hold your hand.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.460
He's gonna want

02:07.544 --> 02:09.711
to kiss you, he's gonna want
to have sex with you.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.424
He's not gonna understand
when you don't.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.553
I just can't tell him.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.763
He'll help you if you do.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.307
If you don't, I'm worried
you're gonna lose him.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.356
Me, too.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.538
I'm deposing your wife's lover
on Thursday.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.748
No, I don't recommend
you being there.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.294

You can tell me.

Whatever...

05:31.164 --> 05:33.750
Whatever it is, um...

05:33.833 --> 05:35.752
you can...

05:35.835 --> 05:37.754
you can tell me.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.256
{\an1}Did you know that,
when I was 12 years old,

05:40.339 --> 05:44.260
{\an1}I was the top-ranked
skater in the country?

05:44.343 --> 05:45.386
No.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.730
And then adolescence struck,
and I got hips and curves

05:55.813 --> 05:57.106
{\an1}and stuff.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.608
Hips and curves?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.693
It's a bad thing?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.073
{\an1}Yeah, it just means
that I had

06:05.156 --> 06:07.325
to skate harder, and...

06:08.826 --> 06:10.787
...I just did worse.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.123
{\an1}I just always felt like
if I could just

06:14.207 --> 06:15.708
have a different body.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.714
After I eat, I throw up.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.177
I just did it a little bit
at first, and then...

06:28.179 --> 06:30.306
...I started doing it
all the time.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.100
Did it change anything?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.811
Not in skating, but...

06:34.894 --> 06:36.479
I don't know, in life,

06:36.562 --> 06:38.106
I guess, it makes me feel

06:38.189 --> 06:40.942
like I have some sense
of control again.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.112
Thank you for telling me.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.489
You're the first person
I've told.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.545
I was there.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.672
What?

07:02.755 --> 07:04.799
I heard her scream.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.971
{\an1}Did you s...
Did you see anything?

07:10.054 --> 07:12.056
H-Happened in the alley.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.725
{\an1}She, uh...

07:14.809 --> 07:16.018
She knocked these over.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.019
Did you see him?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.021
Heard her scream.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.065
{\an3}Look, lady, this is
really important to me.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.692
I-I went out to the street,

07:22.775 --> 07:24.277
{\an1}tried to get somebody
to pay attention.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.820
Okay, did you
see anythiNo!

07:25.903 --> 07:28.030
No, I-I didn't.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.199
{\an1}The people on the street
thought I was crazy.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.325
Imagine that.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.373
God bless you for
what you're doing.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.096

and there it was.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.562

witness a very symbolic moment.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.705
{\an3}Aah!

08:17.788 --> 08:19.415
That was <i> my</i> moment.

08:19.498 --> 08:20.625
I really hated that thing.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.418
Do you know what this means?

08:22.501 --> 08:25.379
{\an1}This means that we finally
have a valid profession.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.590
{\an1}This means that my mom
can finally put me

08:27.673 --> 08:28.883
in the Christmas letter.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.051
{\an3}It was touch-and-go

Yes.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.428
Mmm!

Maybe international in two.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.493
Oh, it's easy.

09:37.576 --> 09:38.661
It's low self-esteem.

to make you feel better.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.385
I'm trying to help.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.804
You can't.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.973
Not if it's about us.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.977
Not if you suddenly realized
what I've known all along--

10:03.060 --> 10:05.396
that you're light years
too good for me.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.567
You didn't just realize that,
did you?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.486
No.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.572
Then I can help, see?

10:14.655 --> 10:15.531
And nothing you can do

10:15.615 --> 10:18.326
{\an1}or say, or anywhere
you decide to go is going

What?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.765
When? When?

10:42.016 --> 10:44.518
Listen to me.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.392
{\an1}And don't even pretend
you know

21:08.475 --> 21:10.185
what she needs
because neither of us do.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.066
WAYNE:
<i>Well, that</i>

21:16.149 --> 21:18.318
{\an1}certainly was not the elegant
mixture of canned meat

21:18.402 --> 21:20.320
{\an1}and vegetables
I'm used to.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
{\an3}I'll take it
that's a good thing.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.532
{\an1}I don't know.
I'm still adjusting

21:23.615 --> 21:25.492
to the concept of taste.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.369
(both laugh)

21:27.452 --> 21:29.371
I'm really glad you called.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.081
And I'm shocked
you called me back.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.249
Usually when a girl tells me

21:32.332 --> 21:33.500
she needs time to think,

21:33.583 --> 21:36.211
it's a polite way of saying
she never wants to see me again.

21:36.294 --> 21:39.756
Well, I had to figure
some things out.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.468
My being here, I take it
that means you have.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.847
Noah and I broke up today.

21:46.930 --> 21:47.723
Really?

21:47.806 --> 21:48.932
Mm-hmm.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.351
Well, now I'm even more
impressed by the meal.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.854
You know, if...

21:53.937 --> 21:56.732
if I hadn't looked out
that window and seen you,

21:56.815 --> 21:58.191
{\an3}if I'd been sick
that day

21:58.275 --> 22:00.736
or helping a customer...

22:00.819 --> 22:02.863
you know what I would
be doing tonight?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.615
{\an3}I'd be picking out
drapes for the house

22:05.699 --> 22:07.534
{\an3}that Noah and I
would be living in.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.454
{\an1}Wow, and to think
I had you pegged as boring.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.583
Then, I have this friend,

22:14.666 --> 22:16.001
and a few nights ago

22:16.084 --> 22:18.879
{\an3}she was in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

22:18.962 --> 22:20.881
{\an3}and now her life will
never be the same.

22:20.964 --> 22:25.093
{\an1}That right there is
why you must seize the moment.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.637
{\an3}(chuckles)

22:27.721 --> 22:30.724
{\an1}Hold on
to what you have.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.727
{\an3}And if I have
a crush on you?

22:33.810 --> 22:37.230
{\an1}You should hold on
extremely tight.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.274
(chuckles)

23:09.304 --> 23:12.307
♪ ♪

23:19.898 --> 23:22.192
(music playing)

23:22.275 --> 23:23.360
{\an1}Would you like
to dance?

23:23.443 --> 23:24.945
Oh, no, thank you.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.655
Uh...

23:26.738 --> 23:28.156
Your drink.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.534
Thank you.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.954
Excuse me.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.038
Oh.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.625
Stop him.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.626
Somebody stop that guy!

23:39.709 --> 23:40.669
{\an1}What, what,
what, what, who?

23:40.752 --> 23:43.171
That's him-- that's the guy
that attacked me.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.673
{\an3}Hey...

23:44.756 --> 23:46.800
What are you doing?

23:46.883 --> 23:50.512
{\an1}I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.557
What's going on?

23:53.640 --> 23:54.683
Nothing, nothing.

23:54.766 --> 23:55.809
Is she okay?

23:55.892 --> 23:56.893
(music continues)

24:30.177 --> 24:32.929
Hi.

24:33.013 --> 24:33.930
Hey.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.558
Hey.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.226
(David grunts,
Gina clears throat)

24:38.310 --> 24:41.062
Well, I guess I never made it
to the other room.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.397
Well, I guess you didn't.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.398
{\an1}I was really
planning

24:43.481 --> 24:43.982
on sleeping on the cYeah,

24:44.065 --> 24:44.774
I'm sorry.hat you were.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.777
Don't say you're sorry;
it was...

24:47.861 --> 24:50.030
it was fine.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.364
(sighs)

24:51.448 --> 24:52.574
{\an1}Okay,

24:52.657 --> 24:54.451
I'm going to go make
some coffee.

24:54.534 --> 24:58.413
{\an3}Hey, David, listen,
I, um... I...

24:58.496 --> 25:00.081
I called Donna

25:00.165 --> 25:02.375
yesterday just to let her know
that I was sleeping over here,

25:02.459 --> 25:04.711
so she wouldn't freak out or
anything, and I just thought

25:04.794 --> 25:07.047
that maybe...

25:07.130 --> 25:11.885
well, if it's okay with you,
I thought I would just call her

25:11.968 --> 25:15.639
and tell her I was sleeping
over here again...

25:16.306 --> 25:17.390
...tonight.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.644
You can stay as long
as you want to.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.483
Thanks.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.485
DYLAN:
<i>Look, I came here</i>

25:28.568 --> 25:30.654
to see Kelly.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.281
{\an1}Has she gotten
any sleep?

25:33.365 --> 25:34.824
No, she hasn't.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.493
{\an1}It's okay,
you don't have

25:36.576 --> 25:39.162
{\an3}to stop talking about me
just because I'm here.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.330
{\an1}We were just
concerned, Kel.

25:40.413 --> 25:44.125
{\an3}Yeah. After last
night, we're all...

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
concerned.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.462
{\an3}Just one big
concerned group.

25:47.545 --> 25:48.463
{\an3}You want
some coffee?

25:48.546 --> 25:49.464
{\an1}Yeah.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.799
That would be good.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.947
(both chuckle)

26:14.030 --> 26:14.948
(sighs)

26:15.031 --> 26:15.991
You hungry?

26:16.074 --> 26:16.992
For you?
Yes.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.952
(both laugh)

26:19.035 --> 26:20.328
Last night was amazing.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.162
Hmm.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.456
{\an1}You know what I would like
to do today?

26:23.540 --> 26:24.666
{\an3}What would you
like to do today?

26:24.749 --> 26:26.501
I would like to play hooky.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.337
{\an1}Close the store
and maybe go for a hike.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.839
How's that sound?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.841
Great, but I'm leaving.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.176
{\an1}Oh, okay, you want
to do something later?

26:35.260 --> 26:36.344
{\an3}No, I'm leaving
for Acapulco.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.847
{\an3}I have a
tournament there.

26:38.930 --> 26:43.476
Oh, you're <i> leaving</i> leaving.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.186
{\an3}Yeah, I know I told
you about this.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.563
Yes?

26:46.646 --> 26:50.650
{\an1}Yeah, so when are you
going to be back?

26:50.734 --> 26:52.569
{\an3}Well, I have tournaments
scheduled all summer.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.362
{\an3}I mean, it's not
like I have choice.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.781
This is what I do, this
is how I earn my living.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.202
And I did ask you
to come with me.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.538
I know, and I told you

27:03.621 --> 27:05.665
{\an1}I can't just
pick up and leave.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.209
I have a job, friends.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.377
My life's here.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.713
Mine isn't.

27:14.591 --> 27:18.970
That does not mean
we made a mistake.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.221
{\an3}(knocking)

27:20.305 --> 27:22.307
Okay.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.232
{\an3}Hey, what are
you doing here?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.610
{\an1}I owe you
a huge apology.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.070
I feel so stupid.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.821
{\an3}I mean, I talked
to Kelly last night.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.531
She told me what
happened to her.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.367
{\an3}That's why you couldn't
tell me what you were doing.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.952
{\an1}Can we talk
about this later?

27:43.036 --> 27:43.745
Listen to me.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.539
You wanted me to
trust you, right?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.041
{\an3}I should never
have doubted you.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.334
I'm sorry.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.421
Um, why don't we go to lunch

27:53.505 --> 27:54.464
{\an1}and we can talk
about everything?

27:54.547 --> 27:55.507
Everything, okay?

27:55.590 --> 27:56.883
Is everything okay?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.468
(door opens)ne, I just...

27:59.636 --> 28:01.596
Uh, the pancakes are burn--

28:02.847 --> 28:04.557
Look, um...

28:04.641 --> 28:06.059
Shut up.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.814
Don't touch me.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.841
{\an3}I'm looking for
a guy named Sean.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.968
{\an3}Right here.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.972
YIs he here?.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.015
Maybe.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.308
(crinkling)

28:50.103 --> 28:51.104
Good faith,?

28:51.187 --> 28:52.647
not that I have much.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.315
The reward's $100,000.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.316
{\an3}Yeah,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.485
when he's arrested
and convicted.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.611
Now, where is he?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.115
(crinkling)

29:03.074 --> 29:05.160
{\an3}Does that
refresh

29:05.243 --> 29:06.202
your memory?

29:06.286 --> 29:08.621
Sure.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.623
Guy said she was hot.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.834
Take it or leave it.

29:16.754 --> 29:18.214
Point him out.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.178
Like I said... you're early.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.637
I'll wait.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.473
Beer.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.932
(bottle opens)

29:29.100 --> 29:30.185
Don't say anything else

29:30.268 --> 29:31.269
about the girl who was attacked

29:31.352 --> 29:33.521
or you'll be picking pieces
of this beer bottle

29:33.605 --> 29:34.564
out of your face.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.374
Hi.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.709
{\an3}Hi.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.879
I need your help.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.547
{\an3}Janet had one too many
piña coladas last night.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.174
She's sleeping in.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.426
Steve, it's almost 4:00.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.221
I know that, and I have
a deadline in an hour.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.014
{\an3}I'm second guessing
my lead story.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.390
Where's Donna?

30:09.474 --> 30:10.391
She went for a walk.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.521
{\an4}Look, this is the
<i>Beat's</i> "Best of"
issue,

30:14.604 --> 30:15.855
except I'm like
a proud father--

30:15.939 --> 30:17.565
{\an3}each one of these
is my favorite.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.443
{\an1}Ooh, "The Unbelievable
Wolfboy!"

30:20.527 --> 30:22.529
Oh, yeah, pretty creepy, huh?

30:22.612 --> 30:23.905
{\an3}His fangs look
penciled in.

30:23.988 --> 30:24.906
{\an1}Oh,

30:24.989 --> 30:26.699
well, that's because they are.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.034
Same thing with his claws

30:28.117 --> 30:29.702
and body hair.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.120
Can you keep a secret?

30:31.204 --> 30:33.039
It's a picture of me
from seventh grade.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.040
(laughs)

30:34.123 --> 30:35.625
{\an3}Yes.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.043
I like you as a brunette.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.044
{\an3}Well, thanks
very much.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.712
Page three girls-- boring.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.838
Boring?

30:40.922 --> 30:41.798
{\an3}Well,

30:41.881 --> 30:42.799
tacky, kind of.

30:42.882 --> 30:43.800
{\an3}I think
she's pretty.

30:43.883 --> 30:44.801
{\an1}She's actually
three girls in one.

30:44.884 --> 30:49.430
{\an3}We kind of pieced her
together after the fact.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.599
{\an3}Sorry.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.434
Sorry about what, Steve?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.144
About this.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.232
It objectifies women
and it's crass.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.317
You want to see crass?

31:01.401 --> 31:02.318
"My Husband Was Eaten
by Pygmies!"

31:02.402 --> 31:04.112
{\an3}I think

31:04.195 --> 31:05.196
that's our winner.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.782
I just wanted to help take
your mind off things.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.117
And you have.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.285
{\an1}In a way

31:10.368 --> 31:11.327
you couldn't even imagine.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.454
Thank you.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.841
He's outside
in the alley.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.801
{\an3}Do you want to catch
this guy or not?

31:26.884 --> 31:29.345
Yeah, let's go.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.441
(grunting)

31:55.580 --> 31:57.832
{\an1}Hey.

31:57.915 --> 32:00.335
(grunting)

32:00.418 --> 32:02.629
{\an1}If you're a cop,
I don't know anything, man.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.465
Guy said if I helped him out,
he'd give me a hundred bucks.

32:05.548 --> 32:06.799
Get out of here.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.512
Stop whining.
You gonna say you're sorry.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.348
YouCome on, come on...ey?

32:13.431 --> 32:15.642
{\an3}...come on,
You shocome on.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.977
Son of a bitch.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.520
{\an3}Dead end?

32:19.604 --> 32:20.855
Definitely.

32:20.938 --> 32:23.358
{\an1}What took you
so long?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.193
I had to finish my beer.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.903
{\an1}Come on.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.614
{\an3}I'm glad you offered
to come with me.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.213
Give me a reason to kill you...

32:46.422 --> 32:49.217
(screaming)

32:49.300 --> 32:51.219
No, no, no!

32:54.305 --> 32:56.099
{\an1}Kel, it's okay,
it's over.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.560
{\an3}It's okay,
Kel, it's over.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.312
No, it's not.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.524
And it won't be until he pays
for what he did to me.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.608
I know.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.944
I know.

33:08.945 --> 33:09.946
(sighs)

33:20.707 --> 33:22.208
Hey.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.045
Hey.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.130
Is David up yet?

33:27.213 --> 33:29.132
David's gone.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.344
So, it's just us, then?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.556
Yeah.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.936
Look, I'm not doing this
to hurt you

33:42.019 --> 33:44.105
or to try and get
some reaction out of you.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.440
I know.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.443
I just really need
a friend right now.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.112
I said I know.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.994
So, how are you doing?

33:58.077 --> 33:59.996
{\an1}You okay?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.789
Yeah, I'm good.

34:03.082 --> 34:05.793
If I was still your friend,
what would you say?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.795
That...

34:09.755 --> 34:11.966
that things suck right now.

34:12.049 --> 34:14.469
That what's I would say
to a friend.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.974
If you were still my friend,
do you know what I would say?

34:20.056 --> 34:22.518
I have no idea.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.062
I would say I feel
the exact same way.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.826
{\an3}(sighs) David's
really sweet.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.536
It's really good for me
to spend time with him.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.833
{\an1}So, what are we
going to do?

34:49.085 --> 34:50.797
I don't know.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.181
♪ ♪

35:01.808 --> 35:02.850
(knocks)

35:02.934 --> 35:04.936
Noah?

35:06.604 --> 35:08.523
{\an3}Noah, just please
hear me out.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.816
(slams drawer shut)

35:09.899 --> 35:12.026
Save it.

35:12.109 --> 35:13.945
I'm sorry.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.699
Look...

35:18.783 --> 35:21.994
I have always known
what I want.

35:22.954 --> 35:23.871
And right now,

35:23.955 --> 35:27.041
for the first time...

35:27.125 --> 35:29.001
I am so confused.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.047
I hope you know
how much I love you.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.215
(scoffs)

35:34.298 --> 35:35.508
{\an3}So much.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.385
And I just want you
to understand.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.553
Understand?

35:38.636 --> 35:39.554
You should have thought
about that

35:39.637 --> 35:40.888
before you lied
and slept with someone else.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.516
I can't change what happened,

35:43.599 --> 35:46.227
{\an3}but I do know how much
we love each other.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.563
And before we go ahead and say

35:48.646 --> 35:51.566
all these horrible things
and we can't go back,

35:51.649 --> 35:54.819
could we please just try
and work through this?

35:54.902 --> 35:56.320
Do you love him?

35:59.156 --> 36:01.200
I don't even know him.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.082
{\an1}I'm going down
to the club, okay?

36:08.165 --> 36:10.751
{\an3}I'm going to find
a really cute girl.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.420
{\an3}I'm going to
take her home,

36:12.503 --> 36:14.755
do the same thing you
did the other night.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.799
{\an3}Then, I'm going to come
to your place of work

36:16.883 --> 36:19.051
{\an3}and ask you to
understand.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.429
{\an3}How does
that sound?

36:21.512 --> 36:24.015
Please, please,
don't do that.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.516
You did this.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.904
I hate the word, "victim".

36:37.987 --> 36:40.114
Yeah, I was raped.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.616
Hey. I thought you

36:41.699 --> 36:43.409
{\an1}were going to go
to the gym, then home.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.912
Yeah, but I left my workout
stuff here. Who's in there?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.163
Oh, nobody.

36:47.246 --> 36:50.166
{\an3}Uh, no one not
in a bikini?

36:50.249 --> 36:52.043
{\an1}Janet, you're jumping
to conclusions.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.086
Are there a bunch
of women in thYes.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.505
Are they there because of
something to do with sex?

36:56.589 --> 36:58.257
Yes.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.176
Then, who's jumping
to conclusions?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.470
{\an4}WOMAN:
I didn't report
the rape.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.596
I felt ashamed.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.264
{\an1}We've all
been through it.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.807
Oh, come on in.
You're new

37:06.891 --> 37:07.934
to the group, aren't you?

37:08.017 --> 37:09.518
Wrong room.
We were just leaving.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.937
Oh.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.314
{\an1}Uh, Stacey, you...
you mentioned that...

37:14.690 --> 37:15.816
Those women were raped?

37:15.900 --> 37:16.984
Yeah.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.986
{\an1}Sexually assaulted
in some way.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.989
{\an1}Their group met at the
community center on Highland.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.158
The one that burned
down the other week?

37:24.241 --> 37:26.827
Yeah. I called to check it out
for Kelly.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.871
They said they needed a place,
so I offered.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.581
{\an3}Oh, your friend
gets raped,

37:30.665 --> 37:32.708
{\an3}and you learn about
support groups.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.169
{\an1}Mace, pepper spray,
victims' rights.

37:35.252 --> 37:37.838
{\an3}You know, Kelly might not
be ready for this yet.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.841
{\an1}Someday, maybe
she will, though.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.969
{\an1}Can I walk you
to your car?

37:44.637 --> 37:46.597
{\an3}You know that thing
I said about...

37:46.681 --> 37:48.349
There being women inside there?

37:48.432 --> 37:52.520
{\an3}And about me not
wanting to work here?

37:52.603 --> 37:55.356
Just forget about that.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.608
Come on, you.

38:00.611 --> 38:02.530
Noah's not going to have
a one-night stand

38:02.613 --> 38:03.698
just to spite you.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.116
Well, he said he was.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.867
He said he was.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.369
To see if it would hurt you.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.829
What did I do?

38:11.080 --> 38:12.540
It's just, Wayne is...

38:12.623 --> 38:14.208
Not around?

38:14.291 --> 38:15.918
And you love Noah.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.507
And if Wayne was around?

38:22.925 --> 38:25.302
Then, you would have
a big decision to make.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.055
Do you mind if I...

38:28.139 --> 38:29.223
{\an3}Go.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.850
Matt's upstairs with a client.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.060
I'll just close up
and I'll get a ride from him.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.145
Thanks.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.944
Tequila.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.320
{\an1}The finest duty-free
had to offer.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.864
Right there.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.907
So, you actually
went to Mexico?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.868
{\an1}Yep.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.578
But did I mention to you
that I, uh...

38:50.661 --> 38:52.705
I have this friend here who
makes high-end mountain bikes?

38:52.788 --> 38:54.582
No, I didn't?

38:54.665 --> 38:57.752
Well, he wants me to help
get his company off the ground.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.753
Oh.

38:58.836 --> 39:02.256
So, you're staying here
because you got a job.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.050
I have a job.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.135
I'm staying here to be with you.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.992
Dylan, have you seen Gi...?

39:54.934 --> 39:56.102
JOE:
<i>So...</i>

39:56.185 --> 39:57.603
I got a case.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.021
Yeah, yeah, you do.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.023
Try not to burst a button
or anything.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.149
I uphold the law, Joe.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.609
Guys like you
take advantage of it.

40:03.692 --> 40:04.819
Whatever.

40:04.902 --> 40:05.986
Look, uh...

40:06.070 --> 40:06.946
{\an3}you know a place
around here

40:07.029 --> 40:08.906
{\an3}where I can get my old
lady something nice?

40:08.989 --> 40:09.865
You know, in anticipation

40:09.949 --> 40:11.742
of this big settlement
you're going to get me.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.077
Uh, yeah.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.037
There's a store downstairs.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.997
My girlfriend,
Kelly,Oh, yeah?

40:17.081 --> 40:19.333
If I tell her you sent me,
do I get a discount?

40:19.416 --> 40:21.961
(phone ringing)

40:24.713 --> 40:25.840
Matt Durning.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.508
Kelly Taylor.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.301
Can you approximate
how much I love you?

40:30.636 --> 40:32.888
Can you get your butt down here,
so we can go home?

40:32.972 --> 40:34.014
15 more minutes, okay?

40:34.098 --> 40:35.516
So I can bill
another quarter hour.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.810
I love you, too.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.689
{\an3}Hi. Kelly?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.023
Sorry. We're closed.

40:47.945 --> 40:48.863
It's you.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.197
Hey, you get out of here.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.658
Shh.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.954

41:11.719 --> 41:13.220

41:22.104 --> 41:24.064
