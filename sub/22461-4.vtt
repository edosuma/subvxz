00:17.120 --> 00:20.599
Work time. Have you got
your couscous salad for lunch?

00:20.600 --> 00:23.439
'My Tupperware box
of tasteless misery sand.'

00:23.440 --> 00:25.399
Yup. Lovely. Thanks.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.679
Hey, tell you what,
shall we just fucking do a runner?

00:28.680 --> 00:32.679
Yeah, let's steal the
cutlery as well and stab a policeman
with it!

00:34.040 --> 00:35.279
Partners in crime.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.999
'Bonnie and Clyde, not the Wests.'

00:37.000 --> 00:38.919
Seriously, Mark, why don't we?

00:38.920 --> 00:41.719
Well, because we owe these people
money.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.559
They've got to pay staff
and there's the utility bills...

00:44.560 --> 00:47.399
All right, forget it.
Sometimes it's fun to be in the
moment.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.079
People who do runners
aren't all criminals.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.159
They definitely are.

00:51.160 --> 00:54.359
It's just Gerrard...
It's made me think about stuff.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.879
You've got to live your life, Mark.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.159
'Uh-oh. Need to shut this down.'

00:58.160 --> 01:00.399
Living your life
isn't just swimming with dolphins

01:00.400 --> 01:02.199
and climbing Machu Picchu, though,
is it?

01:02.200 --> 01:04.199
It's-it's everything. Just drinking
my...

01:04.200 --> 01:07.959
my delicious tea
in this nice local cafe
is living my life.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.199
I've been thinking
we should go interrailing,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.439
for three weeks, maybe, or a month,
stay in hostels.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.319
It wouldn't cost much.
What do you think?

01:14.320 --> 01:15.359
'Well...

01:15.360 --> 01:18.039
I think I hate and fear
all facets of that idea.'

01:18.040 --> 01:20.519
Hello. Why are you up so early?

01:20.520 --> 01:22.159
'So I can stare at your
girlfriend.'

01:22.160 --> 01:23.919
Big Mad Andy started painting the
kitchen.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.039
Ah, yes. Big Mad Andy,

01:26.040 --> 01:29.199
or Big Mad Very Cheap Indeed Andy,
as I like to call him.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.399
So do you need... another coffee?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.799
Sorry, we need to get to work.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.199
Oh, fine. Well, I'll walk with you
cos I need to go to...

01:36.200 --> 01:38.319
that direction.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.879
'Mustn't be in love with you.
You're Mark's.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.399
It'd be like a weird sort of
incest.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.399
Although, to be fair,
even normal incest
is pretty fucked up.'

01:46.520 --> 01:49.039
Dobs, interrailing sounds great,

01:49.040 --> 01:53.039
but I was half sort of semi-thinking
of finally doing an MBA, so...

01:53.640 --> 01:56.319
Do it when we get back.
We're not emigrating to the moon.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.759
'Although that might be
preferable.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.599
Certainly a lot fewer French waiters
on the moon.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.279
Aww, hello!

02:03.280 --> 02:05.199
My landlord won't allow pets

02:05.200 --> 02:06.839
but I wish I had a cat.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.919
I love cats.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.959
Do you?
Yeah.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.879
I love that whole,
"Screw you all, I'm a cat," vibe.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.279
We always had cats at home.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.119
Georgie, Pickle, Fonzie, Socks,
Bobtail.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.319
That's a lot of cats.
We were quite near an A road.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.559
I'd better be off to get the bus.
Laters.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.639
Bye.
Bye.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.519
So are you gonna go interrailing?
What do you think?

02:28.520 --> 02:32.519
Why can't Dobby just move into the
flat so we can have a lovely normal
time?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.399
Is that too much to ask?

02:34.400 --> 02:37.359
Just sitting indoors
with some incredibly strong Cheddar?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.359
'She doesn't want
your boring Cheddar.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.359
She wants my veiny, intriguing
Stilton.'

02:43.520 --> 02:45.679
We do some very nice modern
fittings.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.359
Clean lines, minimalist.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.039
Yeah, we do want the bathroom to look
very modern, but also very
traditional.

02:52.040 --> 02:56.039
Right. It is quite difficult to
marry those very disparate styles.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.159
Well, that's the look that we want.
I understand that.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.159
I'm just not sure that it's a look
that actually physically exists in
the world.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.999
You're looking for
classic meets modern, yeah?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.279
Yeah, that's right.
So clawfoot bath with thinline
cistern.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.999
Fancy taps but rainforest
showerhead.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.279
Exactly.
Can do, sir.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.039
Can do...

03:18.040 --> 03:19.559
and will do.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.559
Erm... Sorry, Hans, this is my
customer. You... you can't just take
my customer.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.079
Yeah, I can, Mark.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.999
For two reasons.
One, he wants me to... Don't you,
mate?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.359
Yes, please.
'Fuck you, Dr Frankenbath.'

03:32.360 --> 03:35.239
and two, as of this morning,

03:35.240 --> 03:37.199
I'm your boss.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.279
Grab us a large latte
and a pain aux raisins, would you,
Mark?

03:40.280 --> 03:42.119
'Come on, fate, this can't be right.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.959
Don't fist me again, fate.'
Oh, Robert...

03:44.960 --> 03:46.559
Just heading out, Mark.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.439
Is Super Hans my boss now?
Have you just promoted him?

03:49.440 --> 03:52.159
Well, it depends how you define
"boss". In the normal way.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.519
Then yes, he is.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.359
'Super Hans has become my boss.
This is insane.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.359
Shaun Ryder responsible
for setting the LIBOR rate.'

04:01.840 --> 04:04.239
You on lunch?

04:04.240 --> 04:07.759
Couscous salad. Dobby makes a big
batch at the start of the week.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.679
She puts little notes in it too.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.599
"Grains for your brains,"
that sort of thing.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.719
"Be-cous I heart you!"
That's today's.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.279
Hmm. Salad's fucking grim, though.

04:18.279 --> 04:22.119
I close my eyes,
shovel it in as fast I can, open
them...

04:22.120 --> 04:24.119
and there's still the same amount.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.479
Listen, Mark, I'm sorry about
earlier,

04:26.480 --> 04:29.959
but I am gonna have to be on your
case pretty much permanently from
now on,

04:29.960 --> 04:31.759
belittling you, if needs be.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.279
No hard feelings, though, yeah?

04:33.280 --> 04:35.119
In a way, I'm pleased.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.399
It's made me
finally decide to do something.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.519
Still plenty to live for, Mark.
You've got a kid.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.799
Not suicide! I'm not suicidal.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.439
No?
No.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.959
I'm finally gonna do an MBA
at evening class.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.919
Maybe get a business of my own
going.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.999
Hmm, that's us both moving up.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.599
Since I've got prospects,
I wanna find the perfect partner.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.599
See, I've been lucky enough to have
shared relationships with some very
creative,

04:57.160 --> 05:01.159
volatile, very intense women,
but now I really want a normal one.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.959
Meet Mr Eisenhower.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.319
Aah!
Isn't it a sweetie?

05:07.320 --> 05:08.719
What do you think, Hans?

05:08.720 --> 05:10.359
I'm guessing cat.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.999
'Yes, and this cat's
gonna help me lure Dobby in

05:13.000 --> 05:15.799
like a classic '70s paedo
in a Ford Granada.'

05:15.800 --> 05:17.479
He's a rescue cat. I rescued him.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.479
Well, not actually me,
some mental ladies whose children
have left home.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.519
Is he a Siamese?
I think so.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.559
Right, yeah.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.319
I don't like those.
They're a bit horrible.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.359
'Brilliant. My woman bait has
failed

05:32.360 --> 05:35.519
and I now have to look after
a cat until it dies.'

05:35.520 --> 05:37.039
I'll make some tea.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.399
'They can live for 25 years!

05:38.400 --> 05:42.399
I'll be 60 and doubly incontinent
and Dobby still won't have moved in.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.719
Understandably.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.519
Great, and it looks like Big Mad
Andy's done no painting at all.'

05:47.520 --> 05:49.879
A cup of char,
or would you prefer some...

05:49.880 --> 05:52.039
'What's a blokey name for coffee?'

05:52.040 --> 05:53.879
hot java?

05:53.880 --> 05:56.879
I'm fine with lager.
I like a proper drink when I'm
working.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.239
Are-are you sure that's Dulux
Heritage?

06:00.240 --> 06:02.839
It's just it's all in unmarked tins.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.359
That's how the trade gets 'em.
Right.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.279
And-and-and that's definitely
Breakfast Room Green?

06:08.280 --> 06:12.279
Look, whatever you asked for, mate,
that's what it is, yeah?

06:12.560 --> 06:15.719
Sure. Brilliant. Many thanks.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.879
'Well, I think I made a pretty
forceful point there.'

06:20.480 --> 06:23.159
So have you thought any more
about the interrailing plan?

06:23.160 --> 06:26.039
'Hmm. Make it seem boring -
my signature dish.'

06:26.040 --> 06:28.999
I was thinking we should
plan the route meticulously -

06:29.000 --> 06:30.759
how we're gonna get to each place,

06:30.760 --> 06:33.879
timetables, hostel pricing
structures.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.159
Really dig down into the detail.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.959
Great, let's do it. Ace.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.879
'Impressive work, Corrigan.'

06:39.880 --> 06:43.879
'Shot yourself in the foot
and then scored an own goal with
it.'

06:43.960 --> 06:45.639
Hi, I'm here about the ballet shoes.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.959
The ballet shoes?

06:46.960 --> 06:48.279
'Is she gonna mention Jesus?'

06:48.280 --> 06:50.879
Sorry, have I got the right flat?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.679
Sara, yeah? Come for the ballet
shoes?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.319
Yeah.
Just a minute.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.639
I've worked out
how to meet the perfect woman, Mark.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.559
Advertise on Freecycle.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.959
Sort out the right combination
of free stuff

07:02.960 --> 07:05.039
and you can engineer who comes
round.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.479
So if they want ballet shoes...?

07:06.480 --> 07:10.159
They'll have a conventional nature
but with an adventurous love of the
arts -

07:10.160 --> 07:11.199
perfect.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.559
Plus, limber, if you receive me.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.999
Where did you get ballet shoes?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.399
From a dancewear boutique.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.479
Cost me a fair bit,
but it's an investment.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.999
And why are you using my flat
exactly?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.679
My place has got
a bit of a men's hostel vibe.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.679
It's-it's a bit rank,
a little bit semen-y.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.079
Hello again.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.639
So... As new.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.999
My sister bought 'em
and then just went right off ballet.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.559
Got into bowling. Different shoes.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.879
And... this is the Squarepusher CD.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.759
Oh, can I just take the shoes?

07:43.760 --> 07:47.399
The advert did say they go together,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.679
the shoes, the CD, and this...

07:49.680 --> 07:51.959
speed goes with it.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.639
It's a package.
Right.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.919
I don't want the CD
or the speed, thanks.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.079
Then I...

07:58.080 --> 08:00.879
can't give you the shoes, love.
Sorry.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.879
Bye.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.839
She obviously wasn't right, Mark.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.719
Might have to finesse the formula.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.759
Don't wanna buy some ballet shoes,
do you, mate?

08:12.760 --> 08:16.759
How much?

08:16.880 --> 08:20.239
Antwerp, city of beer, diamonds,
chocolate

08:20.240 --> 08:23.519
and probably Hercule Poirot.
Let us walk its streets.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.519
Where will the small, yellow,
asexual figurine lead us?

08:28.520 --> 08:31.919
Oooh, look, it's, er...
How do you pronounce that?

08:31.920 --> 08:34.479
Sook-eroo? Sweek-a-rooee?

08:34.480 --> 08:38.078
A lovely street. Let's look around.
We can go anywhere.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.519
'This will slake her thirst
for adventure.'

08:40.520 --> 08:43.919
Ah, it's the, er, Restaurant
Maritime,

08:43.919 --> 08:47.319
which I imagine might well be
a fish restaurant. What else?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.719
Six bars, a pizzeria,

08:49.720 --> 08:52.319
and a large pharmacy.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.719
The dream!

08:53.720 --> 08:55.999
We will do this for real, right?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.359
We will go interrailing?

08:57.360 --> 08:58.759
'Oh, she's insatiable!

08:58.760 --> 09:01.199
I don't wanna sleep
with strangers in hostels

09:01.200 --> 09:03.039
and never have a proper relaxed
poo.'

09:03.040 --> 09:04.319
Yeah?
Sure.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.799
I ju-just need to square things
with Robert and Hans.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.439
You know I'm doing
a late-night stock-take tonight?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.359
No worries. I'll hang out with Jez,

09:11.360 --> 09:14.719
watch Animal Planet
and get all drugged up on reefers.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.159
Fine. I am aware that that's not
the real slang, by the way.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.999
I know you are, Daddy-O.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.999
It's always the same.
I'm off, Jez.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.559
OK. Hold that thought. Back in a
sec.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.359
Why isn't Andy painting?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.959
Andy's my new life coaching client.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.399
He's got so many issues.
He's a genuine gold-plated maniac.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.719
No, Jez! He's properly mad.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.719
He's Big Mad Andy. Someone with
real medical training needs to see
him.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.199
I've got medical training.
I've got a certificate.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.919
I gave you the certificate.
It's utterly meaningless.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.519
In a way, aren't all so-called
qualifications meaningless?

09:46.520 --> 09:48.279
No.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.679
Andy's the most mental man I've ever
met.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.679
He punches people after he's had too
many, but really, he wants to get
punched.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.879
He hates himself.Fascinating.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.199
You know where I am tonight.
Your secret learning thing.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.119
Don't tell Dobby.
If she knows I'm starting an MBA,

10:03.120 --> 10:06.719
she'll realise I'm not serious about
being strapped to a massive rucksack
for a month

10:06.720 --> 10:10.719
and getting stabbed in Boulogne.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.959
I just have to stress again this is
an 18-month part-time MBA course.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.079
'The start of my new life.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.519
Hi there, I'm Mark Corrigan,
MA, MBA.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.479
That spells "mamba",
which is a kind of sexy snake.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.959
He'll be gone by next week.
Why do the thickos come to these
things?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.719
I suppose because the thickos
have insisted no-one's allowed

10:29.720 --> 10:31.679
to say, "You're a thicko," any more.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.999
That's actually
quite a clever move by the thickos.'

10:34.000 --> 10:37.879
Sorry, parking nightmare, red route.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.439
Oh.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.719
Apologies. Rude.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.799
I'm the sort of person
who hates latecomers, and look at me.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.999
You are allowed
to violently hate me. Stephanie.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.359
Mark.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.439
'Wow, she's lovely.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.039
A lovely older lady who's into
business.'

10:54.040 --> 10:56.639
Is he any good?
He looks about 12.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.479
'I can't talk when the teacher's
talking! I have never, ever talked

10:59.480 --> 11:00.959
when the teacher's talking.'

11:00.960 --> 11:03.679
Jury's out.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.679
Cultural and environmental
influences.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.159
Coffee. I used Mark's nice stuff
that he thinks he's got hidden.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.879
Thanks. How's Andy?

11:14.880 --> 11:16.799
Oh, sort of fine.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.999
I'd quite like him to go home now,
though.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.999
But he's vulnerable and, you know,
a violent drunk, so...

11:24.280 --> 11:27.079
'I have to stop being in love with
you. I've got to find your flaws.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.439
You can't be as completely
and utterly ideal as you seem.'

11:30.440 --> 11:32.759
Bees are idiots, aren't they?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.319
They really are.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.319
I hate bees too. Stupid bees.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.719
'OK, huge compatibility
on the bee issue there,

11:39.720 --> 11:42.919
but I bet we're actually incredibly
different in loads of other ways.'

11:42.920 --> 11:45.279
What do you think of Venetian
Snares? Fine.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.159
He's like a decent low-end Samsung

11:47.160 --> 11:49.879
but Aphex Twin's still the iPhone,
d'you know what I mean?

11:49.880 --> 11:53.079
I do. You're completely correct.
Nice analogy.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.559
'Shit.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.039
Please don't be perfect.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.079
Please don't be the one.'

11:57.080 --> 11:59.439
Jez!

11:59.440 --> 12:00.919
Better get back to my patient.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.999
Jez!
Here we go,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.319
back to the maniac grindstone.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.679
Jez!
You all right, mate?

12:06.680 --> 12:08.559
Jez... am I mad?

12:08.560 --> 12:09.879
'As a bottle of twats.'

12:09.880 --> 12:11.119
No. Not at all.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.839
No. You've just got some...

12:12.840 --> 12:15.039
challenging behaviour

12:15.040 --> 12:18.599
and issues around punching,
and we're working through those.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.799
I wanna stop feeling like this.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.399
'Is this good, collapsing?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.799
Positive collapsing?'

12:24.800 --> 12:25.839
Is he OK?

12:25.840 --> 12:29.559
Yeah. Yeah. He's just letting it all
out.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.119
Crying's good. He'll stop in a
minute and feel a lot better.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.639
Do you fancy a Twix?
There's two Twixes in the fridge.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.199
I don't like Twixes.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.279
Yes! She's not perfect for me
because I fucking adore Twixes.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.399
Only joking.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.879
Who doesn't like Twixes?
They're fantastic.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.999
Andy, I know you're working through
a lot of stuff right now, but...

12:57.080 --> 12:58.719
can I just get the Twixes?

13:01.252 --> 13:03.691
'Breakfast blend,
special blend.

13:03.779 --> 13:07.358
Ooh, double black diamond extra
bold, that sounds interesting.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.853
Breakfast blend it is.

13:09.854 --> 13:12.773
Wonder if I should worry about being
quite so attracted to her.

13:12.774 --> 13:14.373
She is lovely.

13:14.374 --> 13:18.293
Maybe that's what I need - a lovely
older lady to tell me what to do
with my life,

13:18.294 --> 13:19.333
a grown-up.

13:19.334 --> 13:21.693
I bet she's terrific at sex.'

13:21.694 --> 13:24.013
Care to join me?
Love to.

13:24.014 --> 13:26.973
'"Care to join me?"
You are such a proper human being.'

13:26.974 --> 13:28.253
He's not bad, this guy, is he?

13:28.254 --> 13:29.813
For a 12-year-old.

13:29.814 --> 13:31.793
'That was rubbish.
She already said that.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.093
Up your game, Corrigan.'

13:33.181 --> 13:35.220
I'm glad I've got round
to doing this.

13:35.221 --> 13:37.300
I've been in and out of PR for years.

13:37.301 --> 13:40.500
Good money, but an MBA's
the golden ticket, isn't it?

13:40.501 --> 13:43.700
The key. No, the biometric swipe
card to success.

13:43.701 --> 13:45.020
'Ha-ha, back on form.'

13:45.021 --> 13:47.500
Do you have any particular business
ideas you're thinking about?

13:47.501 --> 13:51.260
Well, I-I was thinking about
an introduction agency

13:51.261 --> 13:53.140
for the discerning single
professional.

13:53.141 --> 13:54.700
Business people, like us.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.580
Like it. Nice idea.

13:56.581 --> 13:59.900
Yes, I was thinking of calling it
Amicus or Superium.

13:59.901 --> 14:02.140
What about Simpatico?

14:02.141 --> 14:05.380
Oh, that's good, I like that.

14:05.381 --> 14:09.380
You could have two levels -
Simpatico Normalo and Simpatico
Maximus.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.340
So what made you think about it?
Are you single yourself?

14:11.341 --> 14:13.580
Yes, I have been for a while.

14:13.581 --> 14:15.980
'OK, interesting.
Where the fuck did that come from?'

14:15.981 --> 14:19.380
I'm looking to maybe invest
in a small business. We should talk
more.

14:19.381 --> 14:21.220
How about tomorrow? Lunch at the
Plough?

14:21.221 --> 14:23.460
Terrific. They do nice pizzas there.

14:23.461 --> 14:25.940
Slightly asymmetrical,
which I find indicates quality.

14:25.941 --> 14:27.740
'What am I doing?'

14:27.741 --> 14:31.060
'Is this business? I think this
might not be business. Feels good,
though.'

14:31.061 --> 14:32.220
Sorry.

14:32.221 --> 14:34.580
'I'm reinventing myself.
I can be anyone I want.

14:34.581 --> 14:35.620
I can be Bond!

14:35.621 --> 14:39.620
No, ridiculous.
Bergerac. I could be Bergerac!'

14:42.021 --> 14:44.380
I see Andy hasn't made any progress.

14:44.381 --> 14:47.740
Not with the decorating,
but in terms of his mental health,

14:47.741 --> 14:49.580
he's really nailing his demons.

14:49.581 --> 14:52.260
It would just be nice if he was
really painting my walls as well.

14:52.261 --> 14:54.260
How was your business thing last
night?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.940
Fine. Uneventful. Normal.

14:56.941 --> 14:58.540
Not normal.

14:58.541 --> 15:00.180
Odd. Eventful.
Ooh!

15:00.181 --> 15:01.500
What's the goss, girlfriend?

15:01.501 --> 15:04.980
Well, you-you know my dating agency
idea?

15:04.981 --> 15:08.140
What, bringing dull workaholics
together to spare the rest of
humankind?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.820
I met a woman
who's interested in investing in it.

15:10.821 --> 15:12.660
An older woman.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.700
'Is this...?'
Do you fancy her?

15:14.701 --> 15:15.740
No!

15:15.741 --> 15:18.100
Well, maybe a bit. She is nice.

15:18.101 --> 15:20.100
She's grown-up. She wears fitted
jackets.

15:20.101 --> 15:22.820
She's conservative with a small "c"
and...

15:22.821 --> 15:24.540
sexy with quite a big "S".

15:24.541 --> 15:25.900
OK.

15:25.901 --> 15:27.540
One word of advice here...

15:27.541 --> 15:30.460
I-I know, I know - don't throw away
what I've got with Dobby.

15:30.461 --> 15:32.180
No. No, Mark. The advice is,

15:32.181 --> 15:34.500
fuck and suck. Go for it.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.500
I've always thought you needed an
older woman to sort you out. Like a
sexy auntie.

15:38.821 --> 15:40.780
I'm not sure she's interested in me
in that way.

15:40.781 --> 15:43.260
I bet she is. Just dive in, man.

15:43.261 --> 15:45.460
Gather ye pearls while the hog
walks.

15:45.461 --> 15:46.740
Is that from something?

15:46.741 --> 15:47.780
Yes.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.300
No. I mean, just do it.

15:49.301 --> 15:50.900
Pull your pants down and put it in
her.

15:50.901 --> 15:53.460
Thanks for the advice, Jeremy.
That's great advice.

15:53.461 --> 15:55.580
I mean it. Pants down, stick it in.

15:55.581 --> 15:59.140
Thanks. Got it.

15:59.141 --> 16:03.140
How about with the Maximus package,
if you're busy on a work project,

16:03.181 --> 16:06.620
you don't have any free evenings,
you can simply freeze your
membership?

16:06.621 --> 16:08.540
Fantastic idea.

16:08.541 --> 16:11.860
'Wow, you're like a sexy
human Duncan Bannatyne.'

16:11.861 --> 16:13.020
Hello, Mark.

16:13.021 --> 16:14.740
Oh, Jeremy. Hello.
'Why are you here?'

16:14.741 --> 16:17.980
I'm Jeremy,
Mark's oldest and closest friend.

16:17.981 --> 16:21.860
And I'm Stephanie,
I imagine his newest and most
distant.

16:21.861 --> 16:24.540
Not at all. I feel incredibly...

16:24.541 --> 16:26.780
I'll go and order our food.

16:26.781 --> 16:29.980
'Time to stab my friend
in the back. Like Judas.

16:29.981 --> 16:32.620
Out of all the main Jesus helpers,
he was the sexy one.'

16:32.621 --> 16:34.980
She's a hottie. A real hot banana.

16:34.981 --> 16:37.420
Pants down, Mark, stick it in.
That remains my advice.

16:37.421 --> 16:38.900
Yes, it's very easy to remember.

16:38.901 --> 16:40.940
Seriously, I've known her
for literally four seconds

16:40.941 --> 16:44.500
and I really think she might be
better for you than Dobby.

16:44.501 --> 16:47.780
I'm not even sure Dobby still likes
me. She wants me to be different.

16:47.781 --> 16:50.620
I want her to be different.
Maybe it's just not right.

16:50.621 --> 16:53.540
'This is brilliant.
It's like all my Christmases -

16:53.541 --> 16:56.020
apart from the last few,
which were horrible - have come at
once.'

16:56.021 --> 16:58.500
You're not giving Andy
therapy in the pub, are you?

16:58.501 --> 17:01.060
Entering his territory.
Gives him more confidence to share.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.780
He's got a family party tonight.
His ex will be there.

17:03.781 --> 17:06.420
I am life coaching
the living fuck out of him.

17:06.421 --> 17:09.220
You've gotta get him
to talk to someone, Jeremy.

17:09.221 --> 17:12.260
Someone who's medically recognised
by others.

17:12.261 --> 17:14.780
You don't think I can do this, do
you?

17:14.781 --> 17:16.300
Well, I can, Mark.

17:16.300 --> 17:20.300
I'm gonna save this guy and when I
do, I will expect a huge apology
from you.

17:22.221 --> 17:24.579
Sorry. I need to go.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.859
But how about supper at my house
to carry on with all this? About
6.30?

17:27.861 --> 17:29.100
OK. Great.

17:29.101 --> 17:31.180
Superb. I'll text you my address.

17:31.181 --> 17:32.900
You're not allergic to anything,
are you,

17:32.901 --> 17:35.140
like the rest of the world
constantly pretends to be?

17:35.141 --> 17:38.500
Yes, I can't eat dairy or
gluten

17:38.501 --> 17:40.620
and peanuts will kill me.

17:40.621 --> 17:44.380
Brilliant. See you later.

17:44.381 --> 17:45.860
My thoughts get all speeded up.

17:45.861 --> 17:48.340
I just wanna get it punched
out of me.

17:48.341 --> 17:50.340
Have you been doing
your breathing exercises?

17:50.341 --> 17:54.300
And taking Rescue Remedy?
You might be low on zinc.

17:54.301 --> 17:56.020
Sorry.
Er, Jeremy,

17:56.021 --> 17:59.780
I just wanted to say that I'm going
round to Stephanie's house this
evening

17:59.781 --> 18:00.980
to talk business.

18:00.981 --> 18:03.140
Do the business, more like!

18:03.141 --> 18:06.380
The sticking-it-in mime
is not necessary, Jeremy.

18:06.381 --> 18:09.580
If Dobby asks where I am,
can you say I'm doing another
stock-take?

18:09.581 --> 18:11.540
10-4, good buddy.

18:11.541 --> 18:15.300
Text me tonight if things get heavy,
in case I need to spin Dobby a
bigger lie.

18:15.301 --> 18:19.300
OK. Yeah, if things start to get
sexy, I'll... I'll text you the word
"Maximus".

18:22.741 --> 18:26.740
I tell you what, Mark, I wish
Simpatico had existed ten years ago.

18:27.101 --> 18:28.940
I might not have ended up
with my husband.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.380
Right, you're married.
Was.

18:31.381 --> 18:32.740
He disappeared.

18:32.741 --> 18:35.140
Walked out on me without a word.

18:35.141 --> 18:39.020
Literally one minute he was here,
the next he'd picked up his jacket
and gone.

18:39.021 --> 18:40.780
What a horrible thing to do.

18:40.781 --> 18:42.060
'Are you secretly weird?

18:42.061 --> 18:46.060
Have I just walked into a bear trap?
People don't just disappear.'

18:46.181 --> 18:49.740
I think Gerry ended up with someone
almost exactly half my age.

18:49.741 --> 18:51.460
I guess you can't blame him.

18:51.461 --> 18:55.100
You're very attractive.
He-he-he was a fool to leave.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.260
Thank you.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.140
Here's to this evening.

18:58.141 --> 18:59.860
Cheers.

18:59.861 --> 19:02.740
'Am I expecting to have adulterous
sex with Stephanie?

19:02.741 --> 19:04.740
I don't know.

19:04.741 --> 19:06.580
I did put my nice pants on.

19:06.581 --> 19:10.580
But then I also wore those
to the Jubilee Pageant.'

19:10.661 --> 19:14.020
Poor old Mark having to do
a stock-take at this time of day.

19:14.021 --> 19:17.100
As soon as Mark texts that
he's gonna get dirty with Stephanie,

19:17.101 --> 19:19.220
I'll tell Dobby I love her.

19:19.221 --> 19:21.740
Do you think Mark's been acting
a bit odd the last couple of days?

19:21.741 --> 19:24.700
Er... Yeah, maybe a bit weird.

19:24.701 --> 19:25.820
'What if he forgets to text?

19:25.821 --> 19:27.980
What if they get down to it
before he has the chance?

19:27.981 --> 19:31.580
Fuck it, I'm gonna tell Dobby now
that I love her, that I properly
love her.'

19:31.581 --> 19:32.620
Hey, Dobs...

19:32.621 --> 19:33.860
Yeah?

19:33.861 --> 19:35.580
Um... Here's an odd thing.

19:38.021 --> 19:40.100
Er... Excuse me.

19:40.101 --> 19:42.980
Hi, Andy?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.780
Do you rinse pre-loading?

19:45.781 --> 19:47.580
Of course I do. Because of...

19:47.581 --> 19:49.340
The filter!
Exactly!

19:49.341 --> 19:52.460
Who wants to clog the filter?
Lunatics!

19:53.861 --> 19:56.780
'What can I get away with
before it's sure-fire infidelity?

19:56.781 --> 19:58.180
A kiss on the lips?

19:58.181 --> 20:00.180
Some people say hello like that.

20:00.181 --> 20:01.540
Touch the waist?

20:01.541 --> 20:03.460
Another innocent greeting gesture.

20:03.461 --> 20:05.020
As long as she doesn't rub my penis.

20:05.021 --> 20:07.220
No-one says hello like that
other than in prison.'

20:07.221 --> 20:09.700
Back in a mo.

20:09.701 --> 20:12.340
Open another bottle of wine,
would you, Mark?

20:12.341 --> 20:13.900
I'd like to get a little more drunk.

20:13.901 --> 20:16.620
'This is moving up a gear.

20:16.621 --> 20:18.940
Am I gonna do this? Sex with
Stephanie?

20:18.941 --> 20:20.180
I want to.

20:20.181 --> 20:21.740
Shit.

20:21.741 --> 20:25.380
Yes, I'm gonna text Jez
the word "Maximus".

20:25.381 --> 20:26.700
What's this?

20:26.701 --> 20:29.620
"Be-cous I heart you!" Dobby's love
note.

20:29.621 --> 20:32.340
And there's even a little bit
of horrible couscous stuck to it.

20:32.341 --> 20:34.740
Shit, I feel like Alec Guinness

20:34.741 --> 20:37.660
at the end of Bridge On The River
Kwai. What have I done?

20:37.661 --> 20:41.660
Ugh, Jez. "Urgent! It's all gone to
shit! Call me!"

20:42.221 --> 20:43.260
Oh, God.

20:43.261 --> 20:46.380
Probably the worst thing I could do
now would be to pick up my jacket,

20:46.381 --> 20:50.180
walk out without a word
and return to my much younger
girlfriend.'

20:50.181 --> 20:52.780
Hey, Mark, shall I put some music on?

20:52.781 --> 20:56.300
Do you like Van Morrison?
Sure.

20:56.301 --> 21:00.140
Who doesn't like Van Morrison?
I saw him live at Cornbury.

21:00.141 --> 21:01.900
Shall we have a little dance?

21:01.901 --> 21:03.620
'I am so sorry.'

21:03.621 --> 21:05.820
♪ It's a marvellous night
for a moondance... ♪

21:05.821 --> 21:07.540
I'm gonna fucking drink it.

21:07.541 --> 21:08.900
This isn't the answer, Andy.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.140
Yes, it is. Everything's speeding up.

21:11.141 --> 21:12.660
Drinking paint is a bad idea.

21:12.661 --> 21:14.380
'How is this painting my
kitchen?'

21:14.381 --> 21:16.420
What the hell is going on?

21:16.421 --> 21:18.780
You were right, Mark. I was wrong.
I can't fix him.

21:18.781 --> 21:20.620
I'm not Freud.
I want you to punch me, Jez.

21:20.621 --> 21:22.620
I want you to punch me better.
I'm not going to punch you.

21:22.621 --> 21:24.700
Don't punch him.
Fucking punch me!

21:24.701 --> 21:26.740
No. You'll punch me back.

21:26.741 --> 21:29.220
I won't. If you don't punch me,
I'll drink this paint.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.300
This is really cheap and nasty paint.

21:31.301 --> 21:33.460
'I fucking knew it.'

21:33.461 --> 21:35.860
And it'll damage me inside.
It might even kill me.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.060
I want you to punch me hard.
I need to be punched!

21:38.061 --> 21:41.060
You can't punch him, Jez.
That's not therapy.

21:41.061 --> 21:42.780
It's what he wants.

21:42.781 --> 21:44.340
- Kick my nutbag. Do it.
- Do it!

21:44.341 --> 21:46.700
Fucking hell!

21:46.701 --> 21:48.420
Yes! More!

21:48.421 --> 21:49.940
More!

21:49.941 --> 21:52.580
Yes! Fuck! This is working!

21:52.581 --> 21:55.300
Apologise, Mark!
Yes!

21:55.301 --> 21:58.100
This is not a victory, Jez.
This is not the triumph

21:58.101 --> 21:59.740
of your technique.
Yes!

21:59.741 --> 22:01.340
You're just kicking a man
in the bollocks.

22:01.341 --> 22:05.340
More! Oh! Yes! Oh!

22:05.461 --> 22:07.620
Is he all right, though?
The mental health crisis team

22:07.621 --> 22:08.660
are helping him.

22:08.661 --> 22:12.340
I admit my therapeutic approach
was unorthodox

22:12.341 --> 22:15.740
but I think I might
have saved a guy's life.

22:15.741 --> 22:19.460
Sorry you had to work late, Mark.
What a fucker for you.

22:19.461 --> 22:22.100
I want to tell you something.

22:22.101 --> 22:24.020
'OK...'

22:24.021 --> 22:27.300
I haven't been late-night
stock-taking.

22:27.301 --> 22:28.980
I lied.
What were you doing, then?

22:28.981 --> 22:31.180
Do you drive
one of those bicycle rickshaws?

22:31.181 --> 22:34.500
Are you having an affair
with a spy or a hospital cleaner?

22:34.501 --> 22:36.900
I'm doing a secret MBA class.

22:36.901 --> 22:40.900
It's an 18-month course and I
thought if you knew I was doing
it...

22:41.301 --> 22:44.540
I'd know you were lying to me
about wanting to go interrailing.

22:46.181 --> 22:48.660
'Oh, come on, Mark, and the fucking
rest.

22:48.661 --> 22:49.860
Tell her about Stephanie.

22:49.861 --> 22:52.340
Tell her you've got the horn for a
hot MILF. Tell her you want to stick
it in.

22:52.341 --> 22:56.340
You're not letting me steal
your girlfriend, you total bastard.'

22:57.781 --> 23:00.340
Hi, we saw the Freecycle ad
for the cat.

23:00.341 --> 23:02.340
The...?

23:02.341 --> 23:04.340
Oh. Oh, I see.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.140
OK. Great. Yeah.

23:07.141 --> 23:08.300
Take him.

23:08.301 --> 23:11.220
He's very, very clean.

23:11.221 --> 23:14.860
Thank you. And I think
I also have to take a yoga mat,

23:14.861 --> 23:17.540
a size ten corset
and a VHS of The Barchester
Chronicles.

23:17.541 --> 23:20.860
Yeah, don't worry about that.
OK.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.420
'Come on, then, Mark -

23:22.421 --> 23:26.140
time to tell Dobby
about your trip to Cougar Town.'

23:26.141 --> 23:28.540
Mark, is there anything else
you need to tell Dobby?

23:28.541 --> 23:31.020
Yes. Erm...

23:31.021 --> 23:33.900
I realised tonight that...

23:33.901 --> 23:35.740
I properly love you, Dobby.

23:35.741 --> 23:39.100
'No, not that, that's my line!
You've stolen my line!'

23:39.101 --> 23:42.580
And I do want to go interrailing
with you.

23:42.581 --> 23:45.020
You're my double black diamond extra
bold.

23:45.021 --> 23:46.620
Fuck breakfast blend.

23:46.621 --> 23:49.420
Great. Things are a bit hectic at
work at the minute

23:49.421 --> 23:53.020
so might not be able to go for a bit,
but terrific.

23:53.021 --> 23:57.020
And we've already worked out where
the big pharmacy is in Antwerp,
so we're golden.

23:58.181 --> 24:00.140
Tea?

24:00.141 --> 24:03.580
'I properly love you, Dobby.'
'I properly love you, Dobby.'

24:03.581 --> 24:04.660
Isn't she great?

24:04.661 --> 24:06.860
Yeah.
With any luck,

24:06.861 --> 24:10.860
she's the last woman I'll be pulling
my pants down and sticking it in.

24:10.901 --> 24:14.900
'And for that image,
I only have myself to blame.'
