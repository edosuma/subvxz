00:03.414 --> 00:06.249
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:06.251 --> 00:08.150
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:08.151 --> 00:11.220
And welcome to the first
"on location" episode of

00:11.222 --> 00:14.690
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper and</i>
<i>Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present:</i>

<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

00:19.197 --> 00:20.263

As you may notice, just one
of the changes around here

00:53.331 --> 00:55.831
is our new house band.

00:58.569 --> 01:01.604
Who haven't learned
their place yet.

01:04.641 --> 01:08.277
We're also coming to you
live from a different apartment.

01:08.279 --> 01:11.580
Dr. Fowler and I began an
experiment in living together

01:11.582 --> 01:13.983
after her apartment
became water damaged.

01:13.985 --> 01:16.252
This is our
friend Penny's place.

01:16.254 --> 01:18.354
You may remember her
from our episode

01:18.356 --> 01:22.725
And the People
Who Don't Understand Them."

01:22.727 --> 01:24.794
So, in the spirit
of cohabitation,

01:24.796 --> 01:27.797
the theme of today's episode
is flags of two regions

01:27.799 --> 01:29.965
coming together as one.

01:29.967 --> 01:33.636
Such as the flag of
St. Kitts and Nevis.

01:33.638 --> 01:38.107
So, let's roll up our
"sleevis" and get to know Nevis.

01:41.279 --> 01:44.180
Well, I-I like that, but
next time check with me.

01:45.616 --> 01:47.483
Did you know that the flag

01:47.485 --> 01:49.418
was designed by a student
named Edrice Lewis...

01:49.420 --> 01:51.287
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but can we watch the news

01:51.289 --> 01:54.256
or something?

01:54.258 --> 01:57.059
It's cute, they're having
fun living together.

01:57.061 --> 01:58.094
Yeah, I wonder what
they're gonna do

01:58.096 --> 01:59.695
when her apartment's ready.

01:59.697 --> 02:01.464
Actually, it's been
ready for weeks.

02:01.466 --> 02:02.531
What do you mean?

02:02.533 --> 02:04.400
Well, they finished
the work early,

02:04.402 --> 02:06.435
but she's been telling Sheldon
they're behind schedule.

02:06.437 --> 02:08.971
So, she's just
been lying to him?

02:08.973 --> 02:10.473
Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

02:10.475 --> 02:11.941
Yeah, but to make him leave,

02:11.943 --> 02:13.843
not to make him stay.

02:15.513 --> 02:19.982
Buda and Pest
united to form Budapest.

02:19.984 --> 02:21.984
And that's why Budapest

02:21.986 --> 02:24.186
"Budabest."

02:26.557 --> 02:27.456

03:01.653 --> 03:03.931
Thank you for your services,
gentlemen.

03:03.932 --> 03:04.964
Now, I'm hoping

03:04.966 --> 03:05.965
to broaden our audience

03:05.967 --> 03:08.835
with your youthful
rock and roll music.

03:08.837 --> 03:10.270
Aw,

03:10.272 --> 03:12.305
you think you have
an audience, that's funny.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.609
We don't get paid?
Nothing?

03:16.611 --> 03:18.545
Not even a sandwich?

03:20.849 --> 03:22.749
It's almost dinner time.

03:22.751 --> 03:24.217
You in the mood for anything?

03:24.219 --> 03:26.486
Yeah, we could get Thai food
near your apartment

03:26.488 --> 03:28.655
and then drop in and
check on the progress.

03:29.958 --> 03:34.227
Oh, you don't want do that,
it's a construction zone.

03:34.229 --> 03:35.562
So?

03:35.564 --> 03:39.833
Well, what about your fear of
stray nails and butt cracks?

03:39.835 --> 03:42.001
I am terrified of
stepping on a nail

03:42.003 --> 03:43.670
and falling into a butt crack.

03:45.507 --> 03:48.441
Anyway, how about dinner?

03:48.443 --> 03:49.709
You know, if
you'd like, I could

03:49.711 --> 03:51.478
call your landlord and complain.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.180
Thanks, but you don't have to.

03:54.182 --> 03:56.583
Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good
at complaining.

03:57.786 --> 03:59.819
If it were an Olympic sport,
I'd complain about

03:59.821 --> 04:02.255
what a stupid sport it is
and then I'd take home the gold.

04:03.692 --> 04:05.692
Good stuff.

04:05.694 --> 04:09.729
So, uh, what about dinner?

04:09.731 --> 04:10.764
Is it me

04:10.766 --> 04:13.099
or are you purposely
changing the subject?

04:13.101 --> 04:15.101
No.

04:15.103 --> 04:16.870
And on the subject of subjects,

04:16.872 --> 04:19.572
is your use of the word
"subject" the same or different

04:19.574 --> 04:22.709
as when we speak about
the subject of a king?

04:26.181 --> 04:28.948
I have a feeling
you're still doing it.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.151
But I find that topic
irresistible, so,

04:31.153 --> 04:33.420
now, in ancient Mesopotamia,

04:33.422 --> 04:37.390
the king referred to the people
as his property.

04:38.593 --> 04:39.859
I'm serious,

04:39.861 --> 04:42.228
JPL's actually
developing a robot arm

04:42.230 --> 04:44.364
that could grab an asteroid
before it hits us.

04:44.366 --> 04:48.468
So their plan for saving
the Earth from Armageddon

04:48.470 --> 04:52.672
is hoping a bunch of
scientists can catch a ball?

04:52.674 --> 04:56.075
If we're all gonna die,
why am I eating so much kale?

04:57.245 --> 04:59.212
You're awful quiet,
everything okay?

04:59.214 --> 05:02.315
I'm concerned about Amy.

05:02.317 --> 05:04.117
She's acting a bit odd lately.

05:04.119 --> 05:06.386
Oh. Well, j-just
out of curiosity,

05:06.388 --> 05:10.023
what registers as odd to you?

05:13.228 --> 05:15.595
Her behavior.

05:15.597 --> 05:18.264
No, I have the feeling
that she's hiding something.

05:18.266 --> 05:19.766
I wouldn't worry about it.

05:19.768 --> 05:21.768
She's probably just
distracted by work.

05:21.770 --> 05:23.870
Well, whatever it is,
it's troubling me.

05:23.872 --> 05:25.538
And I can't eat, I can't sleep.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.006
And don't even ask
about the consistency

05:27.008 --> 05:29.008
of my bowel movements.

05:30.111 --> 05:33.680
You heard him, guys,
don't ask.

05:33.682 --> 05:36.216
Why would she keep
something from me, you know?

05:36.218 --> 05:38.718
I shared my body
with that woman.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.888
And my Netflix password.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.556
They recommended
<i>Stella Got Her Groove Back</i>

05:43.558 --> 05:45.892
because of her.

05:46.761 --> 05:48.461
Buddy, buddy, listen,

05:48.463 --> 05:50.029
nothing bad is going on,

05:50.031 --> 05:52.866
she just... she just
didn't want you to know

05:52.868 --> 05:56.069
that the work on her apartment
was finished a couple weeks ago.

05:56.071 --> 05:59.005
I don't understand.

05:59.007 --> 06:00.907
She's enjoying living with you

06:00.909 --> 06:02.909
and she didn't want it
to end early.

06:02.911 --> 06:05.778
So, she's deceiving me

06:05.780 --> 06:08.248
in order to spend
more time with me.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.250
Yes.
Oh.

06:10.252 --> 06:14.721
Well, I feel both
flattered and hurt.

06:14.723 --> 06:16.256
Like when people say I
look like that skeleton

06:16.258 --> 06:19.859
from <i>Nightmare Before Christmas.</i>

06:19.861 --> 06:22.462
Oh my God, that's
who you look like.

06:23.832 --> 06:25.598
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.066
It's a little white lie,
everyone does it.

06:27.068 --> 06:28.167
Not me,

06:28.169 --> 06:29.602
I'm a 100% honest

06:29.604 --> 06:31.204
in all of my
relationships.

06:31.206 --> 06:33.106
And how single
are you right now?

06:33.108 --> 06:36.843
Eating-cake-on-the-toilet
single.

06:38.613 --> 06:41.080
Well, I won't tolerate
deception in my relationship.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.016
I have no choice
but to confront her.

06:43.018 --> 06:45.885
Don't do that,
you've got gold here.

06:45.887 --> 06:47.587
Hang onto it until
you're in trouble

06:47.589 --> 06:49.956
and then...
throw it in her face.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.024
What?

06:51.026 --> 06:52.926
Why would you tell him that?

06:52.928 --> 06:54.227
That's terrible advice.

06:54.229 --> 06:57.897
So you wouldn't want to
have anything on Penny?

06:57.899 --> 06:59.432
Well, of course not.

06:59.434 --> 07:03.570
So, if I actually
know something right now...

07:03.572 --> 07:05.138
and I do...

07:06.841 --> 07:08.007
...you don't want me
to tell you?

07:08.009 --> 07:10.243
Uh...

07:10.245 --> 07:11.644
Pfft, no.

07:11.646 --> 07:14.380
I'll take that as a "Yes."

07:14.382 --> 07:17.417
She's secretly been moving
your collectibles into storage

07:17.419 --> 07:19.218
a little at a time
and you haven't noticed.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.187
Are you kidding me?

07:21.189 --> 07:22.622
See, I've known
that for weeks,

07:22.624 --> 07:24.891
but, you know, I waited
till the moment

07:24.893 --> 07:28.528
when it would cause him
the most pain.

07:33.535 --> 07:36.603
Superman's gone,
my stormtrooper's gone.

07:36.605 --> 07:39.372
Your Klingon word-of-the-day
calendar's gone.

07:39.374 --> 07:41.240
I'd say "damn it" in Klingon,

07:41.242 --> 07:43.242
but that wasn't until
next month.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.044
It's "khoo-vakh."

07:45.046 --> 07:47.213
Khoo-vakh!

07:47.215 --> 07:49.582
She took my Where's Waldo.

07:49.584 --> 07:50.883
Well, no, no, he's over there.

07:50.885 --> 07:54.320
Oh, yeah, there he is.

07:55.490 --> 07:58.625
So, what's the deal
with your apartment?

07:58.627 --> 08:00.226
Why's it taking so long?

08:00.228 --> 08:03.296
Um, it was a drywall problem.

08:03.298 --> 08:06.766
Oh, no, what happened?

08:06.768 --> 08:11.671
Well, the drywall got wet,
and you do not want wet drywall

08:11.673 --> 08:15.775
because when drywall gets
wet, it's really more...

08:15.777 --> 08:18.611
Wet wall?

08:18.613 --> 08:22.415
Or damp wall, just as bad.
Mm.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.652
So why don't they
just get more drywall?

08:25.654 --> 08:28.388
Well, they went to get some,

08:28.390 --> 08:32.692
but the woman at the wall store

08:32.693 --> 08:34.360
said it was going on sale
and they should wait

08:34.361 --> 08:37.330
because the savings...
Okay, are you done?

08:37.332 --> 08:39.065
Bernadette told me
your apartment's ready.

08:39.067 --> 08:43.035
I was done at wet wall,
but you wouldn't let it go.

08:43.038 --> 08:45.905
But is Sheldon really
believing all this crap?

08:45.907 --> 08:48.675
Well, he started to question it,
but then I fake sneezed on him

08:48.677 --> 08:51.678
and he ran to take a shower.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.447
Please don't say anything,
I feel terrible about this.

08:54.449 --> 08:55.648
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

08:55.650 --> 08:56.816
Thanks.

08:58.353 --> 09:02.155
"The woman at the wall store?"
Let it go!

09:04.359 --> 09:06.092
Are you going to confront Penny?

09:06.094 --> 09:07.660
Eventually, I guess.

09:07.662 --> 09:10.063
Although, I am kind of curious
how long she thinks

09:10.065 --> 09:12.131
she can keep hiding my stuff
without me knowing.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.833
Hmm.

09:13.835 --> 09:17.003
You know, perhaps
instead of confronting them,

09:17.005 --> 09:18.905
we should see how far
they're willing to spin

09:18.907 --> 09:20.440
their tangled webs.

09:20.442 --> 09:22.041
Like that
Spider-Man action figure

09:22.043 --> 09:24.711
that used to be on your desk.

09:24.713 --> 09:27.580
Oh, my God, I'm going blind.

09:28.483 --> 09:30.483
Hi.
Food's here.

09:30.485 --> 09:32.285
Oh.

09:32.287 --> 09:33.152
Excellent.

09:33.154 --> 09:35.621
I'm very hungry.

09:35.623 --> 09:36.689
Yeah, speaking of which,

09:36.691 --> 09:38.591
what's going on
with your apartment?

09:38.593 --> 09:42.328
Oh, uh, they're still
working on it.

09:42.330 --> 09:43.529
Interesting.

09:43.531 --> 09:46.099
Very interesting.

09:47.902 --> 09:49.802
Yeah, we swung by her apartment
on the way to the restaurant,

09:49.804 --> 09:51.104
and they're gonna be fixing it
for a while.

09:51.106 --> 09:54.941
Wait, uh...
you saw her apartment?

09:54.943 --> 09:57.310
I did, still a mess.

10:01.316 --> 10:03.282
Leonard?
Yeah?

10:05.000 --> 10:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:17.265 --> 10:18.798
W-Why are you
speaking Klingon?

10:18.800 --> 10:21.901
Why are you speaking English?

10:23.037 --> 10:24.036
This is ridiculous.

10:24.038 --> 10:25.404
Penny, do you remember

10:25.406 --> 10:26.539
when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?

10:44.559 --> 10:45.825
Oh, wait, stop that.

10:45.827 --> 10:46.959
You stop that.

10:51.032 --> 10:52.265
Okay.

10:52.267 --> 10:53.900
That's enough.
You know what?

10:54.736 --> 10:56.068
What is going on?

10:56.070 --> 10:58.070
Fine, I told
Sheldon that

10:58.072 --> 10:59.238
her apartment's
been finished,

10:59.240 --> 11:00.640
but then you just said it's not,

11:00.642 --> 11:01.507
so now I'm all confused.

11:01.509 --> 11:04.510
Penny was just
covering for me.

11:04.512 --> 11:06.546
My place has been
ready for two weeks.

11:06.548 --> 11:08.247
How could you lie to me?

11:08.249 --> 11:09.315
Uh, she's enjoyed
living with you.

11:09.317 --> 11:10.616
It's called being in love.

11:10.618 --> 11:12.185
Mm-hmm, and
what's it called

11:12.187 --> 11:13.286
when you
secretly get rid

11:13.288 --> 11:14.720
of all your
husband's stuff?

11:14.722 --> 11:16.856
Wha... That is not true!

11:16.858 --> 11:18.658
Wh-wh-wh... Bernadette
told Howard, Howard told me.

11:18.660 --> 11:21.060
Plus, I can see
all my stuff is gone!

11:21.062 --> 11:24.163
Oh, so, you believe your friend,
and your friend's wife

11:24.165 --> 11:26.132
and your own eyes over me?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.429
Wow.

11:39.981 --> 11:41.447
You really didn't
think I'd notice

11:41.449 --> 11:42.748
my stuff was missing?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.817
Uh, did you notice
your key chain?

11:49.224 --> 11:51.324
Where's Batman?!

11:52.327 --> 11:54.160
Hey.

11:54.162 --> 11:55.161
Why did you tell Howard

11:55.163 --> 11:56.395
I was hiding
Leonard's things?

11:56.397 --> 11:57.129
One sec.

11:57.131 --> 11:58.164
Why did you tell Leonard

11:58.166 --> 12:00.299
I told you Penny was
hiding his things?!

12:01.202 --> 12:02.301
It just came up

12:02.303 --> 12:04.804
because we-we were talking
about secrets and...

12:04.806 --> 12:06.138
Wait.

12:07.475 --> 12:09.542
Everybody
stop it with that!

12:10.411 --> 12:12.178
I'm not really a part of this,

12:12.180 --> 12:14.447
so I'm just gonna dig in.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.716
And I'd like to know
why you blabbed

12:16.718 --> 12:18.217
about my apartment.

12:18.219 --> 12:19.585
You're up, blabby.

12:20.955 --> 12:23.623
Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

12:24.525 --> 12:26.525
I guess it's okay.

12:26.527 --> 12:28.261
I'm sorry

12:28.263 --> 12:30.596
that I lied about
my apartment.

12:30.598 --> 12:32.565
It's all right.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.833
And...

12:33.835 --> 12:34.800
And what?

12:34.802 --> 12:36.702
Your wizard robes
are next to go.

12:38.506 --> 12:40.640
Now that everything's
out on the table,

12:40.642 --> 12:43.509
you-you think you two
will keep living together?

12:44.345 --> 12:46.846
Despite recent events,

12:46.848 --> 12:48.614
I do consider our experiment

12:48.616 --> 12:51.150
in cohabitation
to have been positive.

12:51.152 --> 12:54.086
Are you saying you'd like
to live with me?

12:54.088 --> 12:56.722
I'm open to the possibility.

12:59.761 --> 13:01.761
Whatever.

13:04.832 --> 13:07.033
You know, if he moves
across the hall for good,

13:07.035 --> 13:08.234
Leonard could keep the
stuff you don't like

13:08.236 --> 13:09.335
in Sheldon's old room.

13:09.337 --> 13:10.803
Solves everything.
That's a great idea!

13:10.805 --> 13:13.472
Ooh, maybe I could turn it
into a gaming den.

13:13.474 --> 13:14.373
That would be amazing.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.441
Wait, wait,
hold on, do what?

13:15.443 --> 13:17.777
Excuse me...
that's my room.

13:17.779 --> 13:19.078
But you won't be living here.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.513
But that's my room.

13:20.515 --> 13:22.048
But you won't be living here.
But that's my room.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.316
You guys might want
to start eating.

13:23.318 --> 13:24.750
But you won't be living here.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.286
Sweetie,
once you stop paying rent,

13:27.288 --> 13:28.888
none of this is really yours.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.022
But that's my room.

13:30.024 --> 13:32.258
But you won't be living here!

13:34.595 --> 13:37.263
Thank you
for understanding.

13:37.265 --> 13:38.898
Hey, I get it.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.734
Everybody wants to spend
more time with me.

13:43.171 --> 13:45.705
I'm like a man made of sugar
in a world of ants.

13:47.008 --> 13:48.007
Good night.

13:48.009 --> 13:50.142
Mm, night.

14:00.988 --> 14:04.056
If we did continue
living together,

14:04.058 --> 14:05.591
would it be here?

14:07.328 --> 14:08.427
I don't know.

14:08.429 --> 14:10.529
It-It could be.

14:10.531 --> 14:11.464
Of course there's...

14:11.466 --> 14:13.999
there's always
your apartment.

14:14.001 --> 14:17.236
S-Sure, sure, we-we could
live in my apartment.

14:17.238 --> 14:19.638
I hate your apartment.

14:20.441 --> 14:23.142
Sorry, you brought it up?

14:23.144 --> 14:26.479
Well, I suppose we could
find a whole new place.

14:26.481 --> 14:27.680
You know, and, technically,

14:27.682 --> 14:29.348
we don't even have to stay
in Pasadena.

14:29.350 --> 14:32.251
We could, we could move
to Altadena...

14:32.253 --> 14:35.221
or a place that doesn't
even end in "Dena."

14:35.223 --> 14:36.956
It's kind of exciting.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.992
I mean... we could do
whatever we want.

14:40.828 --> 14:42.094
But what if we move

14:42.096 --> 14:43.896
and we don't like it?

14:43.898 --> 14:45.865
What if there's a smoker
in the building?

14:45.867 --> 14:46.966
Or pets?

14:46.968 --> 14:49.502
Or there could be mold.

14:49.504 --> 14:51.170
There could be traffic noise.

14:51.172 --> 14:54.006
I'm gonna have to learn
a whole new bus route.

15:00.114 --> 15:02.014
Are you trying to soothe me

15:02.016 --> 15:04.650
by singing the <i>Star Trek</i>
theme as a lullaby?

15:05.520 --> 15:06.652
Yes.

15:06.654 --> 15:09.255
I'm not a child,
don't do that.

15:09.257 --> 15:10.990
Sorry.

15:14.729 --> 15:18.164
Do you know <i>2001:</i>
<i>A Space Odyssey?</i>

15:29.143 --> 15:30.810
All right, now
that's soothing.

15:39.821 --> 15:42.788
Look, I-I get it,
this is still my room;

15:42.790 --> 15:44.490
we haven't really
made it yours.

15:44.492 --> 15:45.724
Thank you.

15:45.726 --> 15:47.460
Which is why I got you

15:47.462 --> 15:50.262
this Pink Power Ranger.

15:51.232 --> 15:53.132
Put it anywhere you like.

15:53.134 --> 15:56.435
Okay, but you may feel
some discomfort.

15:57.538 --> 16:00.239
I'm kidding,
I want you to feel at home here.

16:00.241 --> 16:02.408
Decorate it any way
that makes you happy.

16:02.410 --> 16:03.909
Do you really mean that?

16:03.911 --> 16:04.877
I really do.

16:04.879 --> 16:06.312
Great, and just so you know,

16:06.314 --> 16:07.913
I'm not getting rid
of all your stuff.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.248
Yeah? What are you keeping?

16:09.250 --> 16:10.816
That candle

16:10.818 --> 16:12.284
and you.

16:13.955 --> 16:15.387
What about my robot poster?

16:15.389 --> 16:16.355
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

16:16.357 --> 16:18.424
I can make do
with just the candle.

16:25.032 --> 16:27.399
What's going on?

16:27.401 --> 16:30.569
I'm struggling with the thought
of leaving my old bedroom.

16:31.672 --> 16:34.273
Can it be more
of an internal struggle?

16:35.977 --> 16:37.243
I need to see it.

16:38.713 --> 16:40.246
While I'm gone,

16:40.248 --> 16:42.948
don't breathe on my pillow.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.884
How about if I just don't
breathe at all?

16:44.886 --> 16:46.919
That's my girl.

16:53.127 --> 16:55.728
What on earth?

17:09.609 --> 17:11.443
What is going on?!

17:11.444 --> 17:13.112
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

17:13.948 --> 17:15.047
We turned your room

17:15.049 --> 17:16.515
into a sex dungeon.

17:16.517 --> 17:19.084
Oh!

17:19.954 --> 17:21.020
No!

17:21.021 --> 17:22.588
What is happening?!

17:26.227 --> 17:28.127
Okay, last question.

17:28.128 --> 17:30.629
The chaps he was wearing...
assless?

17:32.400 --> 17:35.200
Can we just focus on
the decision I'm facing?

17:35.202 --> 17:36.936
We can, but for the record,

17:36.938 --> 17:39.471
all chaps are assless.

17:39.473 --> 17:42.107
Gentlemen, please,

17:42.109 --> 17:43.976
this is a
significant decision.

17:43.978 --> 17:47.046
Now, do Amy and I
continue living together?

17:47.048 --> 17:49.248
Or do I move back in
with Leonard?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.517
Over my assless chaps you will.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.954
This isn't complicated.

17:55.489 --> 17:56.522
Do you love Amy?

17:56.524 --> 17:57.556
Yes.

17:57.558 --> 17:59.058
Do you like living with her?

17:59.060 --> 18:00.125
Yes.

18:00.127 --> 18:02.528
Do you know what
you need to do now?

18:03.397 --> 18:04.964
Apparently,
figure this out on my own

18:04.966 --> 18:06.699
'cause you guys
are no help at all.

18:25.886 --> 18:28.053
Hi.

18:28.055 --> 18:29.355
Hello.

18:29.357 --> 18:31.223
What are you doing?

18:32.526 --> 18:36.161
I'm just contemplating
Buridan's donkey.

18:36.163 --> 18:37.429
I understand.

18:37.431 --> 18:38.597
I'll leave you be.

18:41.335 --> 18:43.669
What, you're familiar
with the reference?

18:43.671 --> 18:44.970
Of course.

18:44.972 --> 18:46.939
Jean Buridan proposed

18:46.941 --> 18:48.474
a philosophical thesis
stating that

18:48.476 --> 18:50.876
a hungry donkey placed
between two equidistant

18:50.878 --> 18:53.545
bales of hay would be
paralyzed by indecision

18:53.547 --> 18:55.114
and would starve to death.

18:59.820 --> 19:01.520
Exactly.

19:02.690 --> 19:05.257
Well, I wouldn't want you
to starve to death, so...

19:06.227 --> 19:08.594
...here's an eggplant.

19:10.431 --> 19:11.797
Thank you.

19:12.867 --> 19:15.367
You know, some people
believe that Buridan

19:15.369 --> 19:16.969
was plagiarizing Aristotle.

19:16.971 --> 19:18.504
Really?

19:18.506 --> 19:19.538
Although,

19:19.540 --> 19:20.806
in Aristotle's example,

19:20.808 --> 19:23.642
he proposed an equally
hungry and thirsty man

19:23.644 --> 19:25.077
caught between food and drink.

19:25.079 --> 19:26.812
Huh.

19:26.814 --> 19:28.080
Yeah, I wonder if that's related

19:28.082 --> 19:30.416
to the 12th century
Persian philosopher,

19:30.418 --> 19:31.316
Al-Ghazali

19:31.318 --> 19:32.885
and his story of a man

19:32.887 --> 19:34.586
caught between two dates.

19:34.588 --> 19:37.489
Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali
was Aristotelian?

19:37.491 --> 19:40.626
'Cause if anything,
he was anti-Aristotelian.

19:41.896 --> 19:45.197
Al-Ghazali was
anti-Aristotelian?

19:45.199 --> 19:47.066
Boy, you think you know a guy.

19:56.739 --> 19:58.038
Okay.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.975
Open your eyes and
see your new room.

20:05.014 --> 20:07.214
Wow.

20:08.217 --> 20:09.750
I-I know I went
a little overboard.

20:09.752 --> 20:10.985
We can always
dial it back.

20:10.987 --> 20:12.119
No, no, no, no, no,

20:12.121 --> 20:13.020
it's-it's important to me

20:13.022 --> 20:14.755
that you have
the bedroom you want.

20:14.757 --> 20:16.557
Oh, that means so
much. I love you.

20:16.559 --> 20:18.125
I love you, too.

20:21.264 --> 20:23.731
Just hiding some stuff in
your closet, don't tell Penny.
