WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.495
Aliens killed my wife.

00:03.496 --> 00:05.315
It wasn't my hate that kept me going.

00:05.316 --> 00:06.595
It was my love...

00:06.596 --> 00:08.445
Previously on Falling Skies...

00:08.446 --> 00:09.645
Since I woke up with the spikes,

00:09.646 --> 00:11.176
I feel like... I'm drawn to you.

00:12.256 --> 00:13.505
Espheni power core,

00:13.506 --> 00:15.585
was never on Earth in the first place.

00:15.586 --> 00:19.236
It powers the entire Espheni war machine.

00:19.506 --> 00:21.226
We are gonna blow that son of bitch up.

00:21.716 --> 00:23.165
Who do you propose

00:23.166 --> 00:25.716
to pilot that flying saucer to the moon?

00:25.726 --> 00:26.246
Me.

00:26.247 --> 00:27.806
Let me be your weapon.

00:29.646 --> 00:30.976
Bye, Daddy.

00:34.136 --> 00:35.725
Tom always finds his way home.

00:35.726 --> 00:37.805
That overlord said that
there was a danger coming,

00:37.806 --> 00:39.055
and until he does...

00:39.056 --> 00:41.246
We have to finish what he started.

00:41.846 --> 00:44.256
We have to end this war.

00:45.256 --> 00:47.936

Who's there?

01:14.404 --> 01:16.270
Oh, my god.

01:22.712 --> 01:24.846
You're beautiful.

01:24.848 --> 01:27.115
What is it? You look pale.

01:29.586 --> 01:31.085
Rebecca?

01:38.995 --> 01:41.195
Wait.

01:41.197 --> 01:43.064
What are you doing here?

01:44.701 --> 01:46.701
Where are we?

01:46.703 --> 01:48.002
Nice try, Tom.

01:48.004 --> 01:50.405
You promised me we'd talk before dinner.

02:03.686 --> 02:05.219
[Sighs]

02:05.221 --> 02:08.189
How did we get home?

02:09.726 --> 02:12.126
This is just another game.

02:12.128 --> 02:14.128
This is another game.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.764
[Sighs]

02:18.968 --> 02:20.401
What do you want, Rebecca?

02:20.403 --> 02:23.371
The cancer's back. We
have decisions to make.

02:25.475 --> 02:28.576
I remember this conversation.

02:28.578 --> 02:30.044
I know.

02:31.481 --> 02:32.580
Me too.

02:32.582 --> 02:34.215
They say with breast cancer,

02:34.217 --> 02:36.083
you're not out of the woods for five years.

02:36.085 --> 02:38.085
It's been four.

02:38.087 --> 02:41.088
I almost made it.

02:41.090 --> 02:42.590
But this time...

02:42.592 --> 02:46.060
The, uh, radiation, like we talked about,

02:46.062 --> 02:48.729
would be the safest.

02:48.731 --> 02:50.164
It's not enough.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.799
What do you mean?

02:51.801 --> 02:55.069
I want to do the chemo, too,
hit it with both barrels.

02:56.272 --> 02:57.939
Just a round of radiation

02:57.941 --> 03:03.644
and maybe this monster
goes back into remission.

03:03.646 --> 03:07.281
But maybe not.

03:07.283 --> 03:10.818
Then we have to have
this conversation again.

03:10.820 --> 03:14.088
And again and again.

03:14.090 --> 03:18.125
I'm tired of running for my life.

03:18.127 --> 03:19.594
I want to eradicate this

03:19.596 --> 03:22.363
so that it leaves me and never comes back.

03:23.266 --> 03:26.601
I don't want to just survive.

03:27.603 --> 03:31.505
I want to take back control of my life,

03:31.507 --> 03:34.508
of our lives.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.743
Don't you?

03:35.745 --> 03:38.546
[Voice breaking] Yes.

03:41.317 --> 03:42.983
I am so tired.

03:45.254 --> 03:46.954
And you can't be afraid.

03:46.956 --> 03:50.457
You never know where a
rogue cell might be hiding.

03:50.459 --> 03:52.459
We have to stop reacting.

03:52.461 --> 03:54.795
We have to kill it at its source.

03:54.797 --> 03:57.965
You have to get mad, Tom.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.801
More than mad.

04:00.803 --> 04:05.540
Tap into your primal
rage until this is over,

04:06.042 --> 04:08.976
even if it costs you.

04:08.978 --> 04:11.078
Okay?

04:14.517 --> 04:17.552
Find your warrior.

04:20.356 --> 04:21.889
[Sniffles]

04:40.049 --> 04:42.650
[Rumbling]

04:42.652 --> 04:44.519
[Glass shattering]

05:16.719 --> 05:18.753
It's time.

05:18.755 --> 05:20.588
They're waiting.

05:20.590 --> 05:21.822
[Sighs]

05:21.824 --> 05:23.190
[Sniffles]

05:23.192 --> 05:25.861
Dan, they're your soldiers.

05:27.163 --> 05:28.930
They're your people, Anne.

05:28.932 --> 05:31.132
They need to hear from you.

05:33.102 --> 05:36.237
I know it hurts,

05:36.239 --> 05:38.205
but you got to own the pain

05:38.207 --> 05:40.675
so that you can get through it.

05:47.684 --> 05:49.650
[Sniffles]

05:51.054 --> 05:53.287
Okay.

05:54.891 --> 05:56.924
Own it.

05:58.461 --> 06:00.829
It's been two days.

06:01.731 --> 06:03.898
No sign of Lexi and Tom.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.132
So, I'm just gonna say

06:05.134 --> 06:07.802
what you're all already thinking.

06:13.910 --> 06:15.643
They're gone.

06:17.313 --> 06:18.813
They're gone.

06:20.483 --> 06:22.516
That's the bad news.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.789
The good news... they
succeeded in their mission.

06:30.426 --> 06:33.594
They succeeded.

06:33.596 --> 06:36.631
The Espheni power core is down.

06:36.633 --> 06:39.066
And in the days leading up to our victory,

06:39.068 --> 06:41.168
we witnessed a mass exodus

06:41.170 --> 06:44.238
of their ships leaving our planet.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.740
We don't know why,

06:45.742 --> 06:48.643
but we know they have their
work cut out for them now

06:48.645 --> 06:51.245
dealing with the mess
we just made for them,

06:51.247 --> 06:54.181
and that means one thing...

06:54.183 --> 06:56.851
for once,

06:56.853 --> 06:59.153
we have the upper hand.

06:59.155 --> 07:01.288
[Indistinct murmuring]

07:01.290 --> 07:03.124
So, let's do this!

07:03.126 --> 07:05.459
[Cheers and applause]

07:05.461 --> 07:07.695
My husband and my daughter gave their lives

07:07.697 --> 07:09.196
so that we could finish this,

07:09.198 --> 07:10.831
and that's what we're gonna do...

07:10.833 --> 07:12.366
finish it.

07:14.504 --> 07:19.874
I know that some of you
can never forgive Lexi.

07:19.876 --> 07:23.444
There are days I'm not
sure I've even forgiven her.

07:23.446 --> 07:26.013
But whatever she was guilty of,

07:26.015 --> 07:28.783
there's no denying the
sacrifice that she made

07:28.785 --> 07:30.818
with her true father by her side.

07:30.820 --> 07:36.157
They flung themselves
into the unknown for us.

07:36.859 --> 07:39.627
That was my husband.

07:39.629 --> 07:41.762
That was my daughter.

07:43.066 --> 07:44.699
That was my family.

07:52.308 --> 07:54.341
I want these barricades up by nightfall!

07:54.343 --> 07:55.509
Move!

07:55.511 --> 07:56.844
What's the matter, Butterfield?

07:56.846 --> 07:58.412
Is that too heavy for you?

07:58.414 --> 07:59.847
You want me to get one
of the little children

07:59.849 --> 08:01.048
to carry it for you?

08:01.050 --> 08:02.416
Hey, Colonel!

08:02.418 --> 08:04.051
What's with this barricade?
The power core's out.

08:04.053 --> 08:06.187
We need to hit <i> them</i>
now. We need to hit them hard.

08:06.189 --> 08:07.722
What we're not gonna do

08:07.724 --> 08:09.690
is spend another night
risking any surprise ambushes.

08:09.692 --> 08:10.925
What are you talking about?

08:10.927 --> 08:12.359
They're not gonna attack anybody.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.662
They're running scared.

08:14.664 --> 08:17.098
It's not the time to get
cocky. We need to be smart.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.432
We're shoring up our defense

08:18.434 --> 08:20.501
so we can get through
the night in one piece.

08:20.503 --> 08:23.704
Relax. Hunting season opens at first light.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.106
Yes, sir.

08:25.108 --> 08:27.241
Let's move!

08:27.243 --> 08:29.443
[Wind whistling]

08:45.962 --> 08:48.829
[Shrieks] Aaah!

08:51.901 --> 08:53.367
[Grunts]

09:03.312 --> 09:05.212
Come on!

09:05.214 --> 09:07.114
Aah!

09:07.116 --> 09:09.483
[Whimpers]

09:11.120 --> 09:14.822
Rebecca: <i> Find your warrior.</i>

09:25.001 --> 09:26.500
[Shrieks]

09:30.940 --> 09:33.507
[Grunting]

10:05.675 --> 10:06.874
[Gun cocks]

10:06.876 --> 10:08.509
Pope: That's far enough.

10:10.112 --> 10:11.679
Mason.

10:11.681 --> 10:13.447
No, no, no.

10:13.449 --> 10:17.251
You have got to be kidding me.

10:19.756 --> 10:20.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

10:21.531 --> 10:23.231
Don't do that.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.900
Let me get this straight.

10:25.902 --> 10:28.369
You hijack an alien ship,

10:28.371 --> 10:29.871
fly a one-way ticket to the moon,

10:29.873 --> 10:33.074
get lost somewhere up there
in the void of the galaxy,

10:33.076 --> 10:36.612
and you still won't die.

10:37.714 --> 10:40.548
What's in the bag, Cambridge?

10:40.550 --> 10:45.520
Hey, hold on a second.
Wait one damn second!

10:45.522 --> 10:48.423
What the hell happened to you?

11:11.815 --> 11:13.815
Oh, my god.

11:13.817 --> 11:16.384
Tom?

11:20.223 --> 11:22.590
Oh, god.

11:22.592 --> 11:26.594
If I'm dreaming, then
I'll never want to wake up.

11:33.937 --> 11:36.371
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

11:36.373 --> 11:39.340
You have to tell me.

11:41.711 --> 11:43.344
Lexi?

11:44.347 --> 11:47.082
She saved us all.

11:48.718 --> 11:50.018
Oh.

11:57.427 --> 12:01.096
Is that some kind of new Volm toy?

12:01.098 --> 12:02.297
Have you used it before?

12:02.299 --> 12:03.531
Relax.

12:03.533 --> 12:04.732
It's gonna detect abnormalities

12:04.734 --> 12:06.267
faster than I can right now.

12:06.269 --> 12:09.370
I think if I had been force-fed
eye worms, I would know it.

12:09.372 --> 12:11.372
Has a certain subtle telltale feeling

12:11.374 --> 12:13.875
like electroshock therapy.

12:13.877 --> 12:16.277
So, you've told us everything
about the overload... "Scorch."

12:16.279 --> 12:19.280
Yeah, and your last-second
escape from the Beamer and...

12:19.282 --> 12:22.550
But you haven't told us how
the hell you got back here.

12:22.552 --> 12:24.719
You're all clean.

12:27.124 --> 12:28.723
- What?
- Take that off.

12:28.725 --> 12:31.326
- My necklace?
- Take it off.

12:31.328 --> 12:33.628
Take it off. I don't want you to wear it.

12:33.630 --> 12:36.264
- [Chuckles] What?
- I'll explain it to you later.

12:36.266 --> 12:37.765
Just trust me.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.501
Thank you.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.013
Yeah, anyway, like I said,

12:45.015 --> 12:46.982
I was back in my bedroom in Boston.

12:46.984 --> 12:50.318
You mean back home?

12:50.320 --> 12:53.822
Yeah, except it wasn't
a dream. It was a memory.

12:54.658 --> 12:57.025
And it wasn't invasive
like with the Espheni.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.326
It was, um...

12:58.328 --> 13:00.028
there was something very vivid about it,

13:00.030 --> 13:01.663
almost pleasant.

13:01.665 --> 13:04.132
Warm.

13:05.269 --> 13:08.169
It was coming from
somebody who really knew me.

13:08.171 --> 13:09.938
Somebody that knew you?

13:09.940 --> 13:11.406
Well, what was it?

13:11.408 --> 13:15.677
The memory was, uh, a long time ago

13:16.179 --> 13:17.879
when your mom,

13:17.881 --> 13:20.916
Rebecca, had breast cancer.

13:22.519 --> 13:24.352
Only there was something
even unnatural about her.

13:24.354 --> 13:26.021
It was like it was her, but it wasn't her.

13:26.023 --> 13:28.490
Anne: Hmm?

13:32.362 --> 13:36.865
I... wish I could remember more.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.199
Okay.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.401
I think you were hypothermic,

13:39.403 --> 13:42.404
hallucinating in that freezing Beamer

13:42.406 --> 13:43.939
that was spinning into space,

13:43.941 --> 13:46.474
and that's how you're
coming up with these visions.

13:46.476 --> 13:49.210
Yeah, but... but how
did he get from space...

13:49.212 --> 13:50.745
To the ocean? I don't know.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.781
Maybe when you were incapacitated,

13:52.783 --> 13:54.482
there was some autopilot function

13:54.484 --> 13:56.651
that landed the Beamer in
the water or ejected you.

13:56.653 --> 13:58.920
That's as good of an
explanation as I've heard so far.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.222
Or maybe the Beamer sank.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.425
Maybe... maybe none of that matters.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.060
Exactly.

14:05.062 --> 14:06.328
Anne: [Sighs] You're right.

14:06.330 --> 14:09.097
All that matters is that you're back.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.632
Exactly.

14:10.634 --> 14:14.736
Tom: I wish I had a
better story to tell you.

14:14.738 --> 14:18.273
I really do, because, let's face it,

14:18.275 --> 14:22.177
my sudden return here
is... a little freaky.

14:22.179 --> 14:24.145
[Sarcastically] No.

14:24.147 --> 14:26.648
I got a clean bill of health.

14:26.650 --> 14:29.150
So, as I know more, you'll know more.

14:29.152 --> 14:32.754
And in the meantime, uh...

14:32.756 --> 14:36.291
As you've heard...

14:36.293 --> 14:40.595
Anne and I lost our
daughter on this mission.

14:40.597 --> 14:43.131
And what I'm about to
say may strike some of you

14:43.133 --> 14:45.367
as a little unusual coming from me.

14:46.536 --> 14:49.270
But I'm doing a lot of
thinking about what it's meant

14:49.272 --> 14:51.439
to pay for this war
with people that I love.

14:51.441 --> 14:55.010
And one thing is clear... I'm mad.

14:55.012 --> 14:57.946
Every single person here has
lost someone that they love,

14:57.948 --> 15:00.115
someone who's made the ultimate sacrifice

15:00.117 --> 15:01.349
for the greater good,

15:01.351 --> 15:02.884
and for those sacrifices to mean anything,

15:02.886 --> 15:04.786
we're gonna have to win this war.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.021
All: Yeah!

15:06.023 --> 15:07.322
And to win the war,

15:07.324 --> 15:09.290
I'm gonna need you to get mad with me!

15:11.728 --> 15:13.828
I'm not talking about anger.
I'm talking about rage.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.131
All: Yeah! You think
you're mad, but you're not.

15:16.133 --> 15:19.801
It's human nature to take your foot off
the gas right before the finish line.

15:19.803 --> 15:22.137
We're not gonna do that.

15:22.139 --> 15:23.972
This is the time for overkill,

15:23.974 --> 15:26.508
to fire both barrels, to
use everything we've got!

15:26.510 --> 15:28.977
- All: Yeah!
- Our enemy is still out there,

15:28.979 --> 15:31.312
but they're unprotected
and they're vulnerable

15:31.314 --> 15:33.648
and they are just waiting
for us to take them out,

15:33.650 --> 15:35.316
if we've got the will to do it!

15:35.318 --> 15:36.918
- [Cheering]
- Man: Hell, yeah!

15:36.920 --> 15:39.721
Because when the last bullet
goes into the last Skitter,

15:39.723 --> 15:40.889
this war's over!

15:40.891 --> 15:42.057
All: Yeah!

15:42.059 --> 15:45.593
Soon the time will come

15:45.595 --> 15:50.331
for us to go back to being
doctors and bricklayers,

15:50.333 --> 15:53.868
schoolteachers, mothers and fathers,

15:53.870 --> 15:56.671
but that time is not now.

15:56.673 --> 15:58.540
That is not who we are.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.075
Right now, we are warriors.

16:00.077 --> 16:01.776
[Cheering]

16:01.778 --> 16:06.214
And so I'm putting a challenge
to each and every one of you...

16:06.216 --> 16:07.682
To find your warrior.

16:07.684 --> 16:10.318
[Cheers and applause]

16:32.732 --> 16:34.231
The Espheni are on their heels now.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.400
Should be a turkey shoot.

16:36.402 --> 16:38.869
Skitters, hornets, anything
with a pulse, we take out.

16:38.871 --> 16:40.304
Right, first we got to go after

16:40.306 --> 16:42.373
the heart of their war
machine, which is its tech.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.576
We got to dismantle as much
as we can as fast as we can.

16:45.578 --> 16:47.544
Beamers and Mechs?

16:47.546 --> 16:49.179
Not much of a threat
with the power core gone.

16:49.181 --> 16:51.081
Cochise, can we count
on help from the Volm?

16:51.083 --> 16:53.317
We're gonna need air attacks
to accelerate this plan.

16:53.319 --> 16:56.086
Our fleet consists of
only three galleons...

16:56.088 --> 16:57.354
uh, heavy bombers...

16:57.356 --> 16:59.390
which lack the surgical strike ability

16:59.392 --> 17:01.258
to target the enemy as you suggest.

17:01.260 --> 17:04.161
Collateral damage would be... incalculable.

17:04.163 --> 17:06.530
I guarantee the Espheni are trying
to get their weapons back online,

17:06.531 --> 17:08.499
so we can't just talk about this.

17:08.501 --> 17:10.099
We got to find a way to locate their tech.

17:10.102 --> 17:12.903
I am able to obtain longitudinal data

17:12.905 --> 17:15.172
from our recon drones.

17:15.174 --> 17:17.107
The batteries are still
emitting enough energy

17:17.108 --> 17:18.575
to provide a ping beacon.

17:18.577 --> 17:22.179
And, indeed, I have
located Mechs and Beamers

17:22.181 --> 17:24.348
within a three-sectored
radius of our position.

17:24.349 --> 17:28.352
Three. One, two, and three.

17:28.454 --> 17:30.153
We're gonna have to be careful.

17:30.155 --> 17:32.990
They might have enough battery
energy left to fry us where we stand.

17:32.992 --> 17:35.225
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie teams...
everybody gets a vehicle.

17:35.227 --> 17:36.527
Alpha Team goes north along the Savannah.

17:36.529 --> 17:38.061
Bravo Team goes west over this hill,

17:38.063 --> 17:40.063
and Charlie Team drives
south to Baldwin Park.

17:40.065 --> 17:42.900
I guess nobody's told you... we don't have
anything with an engine and four wheels.

17:42.902 --> 17:45.002
Disabled Beamer fell into our
lot when the power grid went down.

17:45.004 --> 17:46.904
- What? Are you ki...
- Yeah. Got one truck. Not ready yet.

17:46.906 --> 17:48.672
Are you kidding me? What
exactly is the plan then?

17:48.674 --> 17:50.574
We're gonna explore these things on foot?

17:50.576 --> 17:52.910
It's gonna have to be slow going.
That's what it's gonna have to be.

17:52.912 --> 17:54.745
- Just expand our radius mile by mile...
- We're gonna have to go inch by inch.

17:54.747 --> 17:56.413
- It'll be slow going...
- Till we take over the entire...

17:56.415 --> 17:57.915
how is it we don't have any vehicles?

17:57.917 --> 18:00.183
I've been assured that other
militias will follow suit.

18:00.185 --> 18:02.185
What? What?! Did you say other militias?

18:02.187 --> 18:03.387
Other human militias?

18:03.389 --> 18:05.756
Our galleons have confirmed

18:05.758 --> 18:08.592
317 militias worldwide...

18:08.594 --> 18:11.028
the largest so far in Sao Paulo, Cape Town,

18:11.030 --> 18:13.330
and Tucson, Arizona.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.334
Militias. [Chuckles]

18:17.336 --> 18:18.936
Armed and ready to fight.

18:18.938 --> 18:20.537
In that way, they are prepared.

18:20.539 --> 18:24.608
They lack organization,
however... a plan, a leader.

18:24.610 --> 18:27.044
And a way to communicate with each other,

18:27.046 --> 18:29.680
- except through the Volm.
- Mm.

18:29.682 --> 18:31.248
Well, make sure you tell
them what we're doing,

18:31.250 --> 18:32.516
and hopefully, we can
all get on the same page.

18:32.518 --> 18:37.321
Can wipe these bastards out together.

18:39.191 --> 18:43.961
Hey. I know you're hurting
more than you let on.

18:43.963 --> 18:48.198
It's not hard to tell... or feel.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.500
I promised to protect her.

18:50.502 --> 18:51.866
It should have been me on that Beamer.

18:51.971 --> 18:54.471
Well, you got to let it go, Ben.

18:54.473 --> 18:58.408
You know, it's time to
move on for all of us.

18:58.410 --> 18:59.943
I'll catch you guys up there.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.312
Hey, man.

19:04.817 --> 19:06.650
Hi.

19:06.652 --> 19:08.785
I miss her, too.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.156
[Sighs]

19:13.158 --> 19:14.558
Hey, could you give us a minute?

19:14.560 --> 19:17.260
Yeah.

19:17.262 --> 19:18.829
All right.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.500
[Sighs]

19:23.502 --> 19:25.902
We got to stick together, brother.

19:25.904 --> 19:28.605
So, we got a job.

19:28.607 --> 19:31.341
Um, Weaver wants to take off A.S.A.P.

19:31.343 --> 19:32.843
You're on Bravo Team.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.077
What team are you on?

19:34.079 --> 19:35.512
I'm on Alpha.

19:36.815 --> 19:38.682
And Maggie?

19:38.684 --> 19:40.384
Alpha.

19:41.587 --> 19:45.155
Right. Got to stick together.

19:45.157 --> 19:48.358
Alpha Team's locked and loaded.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
Bravo Team, we're a go.

19:50.362 --> 19:51.862
Anne: I just can't believe it.

19:51.864 --> 19:54.431
- Can we talk to these other militias?
- Soon, we hope.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.033
In the meantime, we'll just
stay focused on the mission.

19:56.035 --> 19:57.300
As you should.

19:57.302 --> 19:59.136
- Thank you, Shaq.
- Welcome.

19:59.138 --> 20:00.010
What about the Overlords?

20:00.024 --> 20:02.625
Didn't Cochise estimate that
there were 500 worldwide?

20:02.627 --> 20:03.959
I mean, do we really think they bailed

20:03.961 --> 20:05.194
before their power went down?

20:05.196 --> 20:06.929
Tom: I think most of them died trying.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.198
I saw an Espheni ship crash
on my way back to camp.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.300
- I doubt it was the only one.
- I hope so.

20:11.302 --> 20:13.636
The cost was high. Matt, stay back at camp.

20:13.638 --> 20:15.371
I... I'm coming this time.

20:15.373 --> 20:17.139
I don't think so.

20:17.141 --> 20:19.108
Tom?

20:21.379 --> 20:23.679
Okay.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.681
You can come.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.783
Stay close, though, huh?

20:27.785 --> 20:29.418
Let's move out!

20:31.602 --> 20:33.535
Hal: Go, go, go, go!

20:40.077 --> 20:42.278
Okay.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.613
- Charges set?
- Two support beams on the south.

20:44.615 --> 20:45.814
- One in the front.
- Two in the back.

20:45.816 --> 20:46.815
Should take the Beamer

20:46.817 --> 20:48.150
out of commission for good.

20:48.152 --> 20:48.817
All right.

20:48.819 --> 20:50.452
Three, two...

20:50.454 --> 20:52.988
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look over there.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.324
[Screeching]

20:56.294 --> 20:59.495
They're going after that dead cow.

20:59.497 --> 21:01.397
It's not very often you
see them alone out here

21:01.399 --> 21:03.632
like this with no formations.

21:03.634 --> 21:04.967
There's no Overlord.

21:04.969 --> 21:06.735
They're completely chaotic without them.

21:06.737 --> 21:08.404
Anthony: Man, those Skitters are starving.

21:08.406 --> 21:10.839
Looks like they'll eat
anything, even each other.

21:10.841 --> 21:12.675
Like a bunch of wild animals.

21:12.677 --> 21:14.677
And just as stupid.

21:14.679 --> 21:16.245
Man.

21:16.247 --> 21:17.913
For the first time in three years,

21:17.915 --> 21:19.348
this is gonna be a damn carnival.

21:19.350 --> 21:20.783
All right, and I'm gonna win you

21:20.785 --> 21:21.850
a giant stuffed panda bear.

21:21.852 --> 21:24.019
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.954
[Screeches]

21:25.956 --> 21:28.290
We got a little opportunity here.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.025
Kill a bunch of birds with one stone?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.527
Good thinking.

21:33.864 --> 21:35.864
Wait... For...

21:35.866 --> 21:37.433
- It.
- [Beeps]

21:39.837 --> 21:40.936
Whoo!

21:40.938 --> 21:42.204
[Laughs]

21:42.206 --> 21:45.307
- Nice!
- That was nice.

21:45.309 --> 21:46.942
There's a lot more where that came from.

21:46.944 --> 21:48.143
I think so.

21:48.145 --> 21:49.545
If you're not too afraid.

21:49.547 --> 21:52.548
Oh, please. Not with
you here to protect me.

21:52.550 --> 21:55.284
Weaver: Team Alpha already
hit their targets. Our turn.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.187
Less than 300 meters from Espheni tech.

21:58.189 --> 22:00.723
Lightning strike, then
get the hell out of dodge.

22:00.725 --> 22:03.592
Loose arrowhead on me.

22:06.997 --> 22:09.298
- Is this Dodge?
- Shut up.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.976
Hey, whoa! Cease fire!

22:27.318 --> 22:29.051
They're not shooting back.

22:29.053 --> 22:32.354
Just enough juice left in
them to give us a scare.

22:32.416 --> 22:34.283
Easy, though.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.325
Let's get to it.

22:43.327 --> 22:48.163
Salvage anything you think we can use.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.165
So many possibilities...

22:50.247 --> 22:53.148
So little time.

23:07.898 --> 23:09.565
What is it?

23:13.938 --> 23:16.538
Tom: That is our target.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.840
It's an Overlord escape
pod from a cruiser...

23:18.842 --> 23:20.242
remote controlled.

23:20.244 --> 23:21.910
Yeah, it doesn't look
like the kind of thing

23:21.912 --> 23:23.178
we ever want to come back online.

23:23.180 --> 23:24.746
The damage looks pretty significant.

23:24.748 --> 23:28.684
I don't think anybody
could have survived that.

23:28.686 --> 23:30.218
Better safe than sorry.

23:30.220 --> 23:31.787
Want to blow some stuff up?

23:31.789 --> 23:33.021
[Chuckles] Yeah.

23:33.023 --> 23:34.623
Scotty, you got those bombs?

23:34.625 --> 23:35.958
Yes, sir.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.327
[Branches snap]

23:44.535 --> 23:45.834
[Screeching]

23:54.778 --> 23:56.979
They got us surrounded.

23:56.981 --> 23:58.914
It's a trap.

23:58.916 --> 24:00.248
Stay loose.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.684
Matt, watch your flank.

24:05.556 --> 24:07.556
Easy, easy.

24:07.558 --> 24:10.158
Cochise.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.761
What's taking them so long?

24:12.763 --> 24:15.263
Cochise: Tom Mason must be in trouble.

24:15.265 --> 24:18.333
I'm so glad I brought you along.

24:22.940 --> 24:24.740
Charlie team needs backup!

24:24.742 --> 24:26.775
We're moving out! Now.

24:26.777 --> 24:28.410
Let's go!

24:33.517 --> 24:35.283
[Screams]

24:35.285 --> 24:36.585
Scotty!

24:44.662 --> 24:45.861
Anne: Is he gonna make it?

24:45.863 --> 24:47.195
He's gone.

24:47.197 --> 24:50.165
Scotty, I'm still gonna need your help.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.367
[Grunts] Cover me.

24:52.369 --> 24:53.769
Where the hell are you going?!

24:53.771 --> 24:55.070
Cover me!

25:02.813 --> 25:04.379
Shit!

25:04.381 --> 25:05.714
[Hisses]

25:05.716 --> 25:08.116
Show me what you got.

25:09.887 --> 25:11.053
[Groans]

25:15.826 --> 25:17.092
Don't fight it.

25:22.566 --> 25:25.133
Thank you, Scotty.

25:28.405 --> 25:29.905
I'm sorry.

25:30.808 --> 25:32.474
It's okay. It's okay.

25:32.476 --> 25:35.210
Let go.

25:35.212 --> 25:37.279
Let go.

25:41.919 --> 25:43.151
Come and get it!

25:43.153 --> 25:45.153
Come on! Keep coming closer.

25:53.564 --> 25:55.864
Let go.

25:55.866 --> 25:57.566
Let go.

25:57.568 --> 25:59.167
Just let go.

26:02.606 --> 26:04.439
[Gunfire]

26:04.441 --> 26:07.142
[Screeching]

26:31.135 --> 26:34.536
Okay, three, two, one!

26:34.538 --> 26:36.972
[Clicking]

26:37.941 --> 26:40.308
[Clicking]

26:40.310 --> 26:41.309
Run.

26:41.311 --> 26:43.211
Run!

26:46.383 --> 26:47.883
[Gun clicks]

26:47.885 --> 26:50.185
[Gunfire]

26:56.393 --> 26:58.460
Oh, thank you, Daniel F. Weaver.

26:58.462 --> 27:00.061
- Shoot the bombs!
- I'm jammed.

27:00.063 --> 27:01.663
I'm out.

27:01.665 --> 27:02.498
Shoot the bombs!

27:02.500 --> 27:04.566
Sara! Take the shot!

27:04.568 --> 27:06.668
Shoot the bombs!

27:21.451 --> 27:23.185
[Cheering]

27:23.187 --> 27:24.586
Yeah! Yeah!

27:24.588 --> 27:26.354
- All right!
- [Laughs]

27:26.356 --> 27:27.556
Yeah!

27:30.961 --> 27:33.628
I... I got it?

27:33.630 --> 27:35.331
[Laughs]

27:35.663 --> 27:36.862
Nice shot.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.598
Thank god for small miracles.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.534
Nice shooting, Tex.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.503
Whoo-hoo!

27:48.042 --> 27:51.677
I notice Ben and I were
put on separate teams.

27:51.679 --> 27:53.045
Was that intentional?

27:53.047 --> 27:55.380
Of course not.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.449
You're still not letting this go.

27:57.451 --> 27:59.484
How about this?

27:59.486 --> 28:01.053
Oh, Christ. Here we go.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.354
Not letting you go.

28:02.356 --> 28:04.356
So, what do you think about that?

28:04.358 --> 28:06.892
Well, I didn't know you had a
hold on me in the first place.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.160
[Chuckles]

28:08.302 --> 28:09.702
What, did we sign papers?

28:09.704 --> 28:12.371
You know what I mean.

28:12.373 --> 28:13.939
I care about you, Maggie.

28:13.941 --> 28:16.709
Right, well, that's not the
first time you've said that.

28:16.711 --> 28:19.945
Yeah, well, it might be the last.

28:19.947 --> 28:22.614
I mean, what do you want me to say?

28:23.951 --> 28:26.685
All right, all right, all right.

28:26.687 --> 28:29.121
I'm in love with you. Do you know that?

28:30.658 --> 28:34.126
And, yeah, I... I love Ben.

28:34.128 --> 28:35.894
And I'm asking you...

28:35.896 --> 28:38.630
to hurt him, to break his heart

28:38.632 --> 28:42.301
so you can be with me.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.137
So... There.

28:45.139 --> 28:47.806
That's... then that's everything.

28:49.744 --> 28:52.211
I love you, too, Hal.

28:54.248 --> 28:57.983
I just can't... stop...

28:57.985 --> 29:00.319
- Stop what?
- These feelings for Ben...

29:00.321 --> 29:03.021
I can't control them, okay?

29:03.023 --> 29:06.125
And neither can you.

29:10.364 --> 29:12.965
[Sighs]

29:14.535 --> 29:15.934
You okay?

29:15.936 --> 29:17.002
Yeah.

29:17.004 --> 29:19.271
I think next time, I'll stay at camp.

29:19.273 --> 29:21.073
Maybe I shouldn't have brought him along.

29:21.075 --> 29:22.775
Ben was his age, though.

29:22.777 --> 29:26.044
He's 14. He's spinning a bit
seeing what you did with Scotty.

29:26.046 --> 29:27.279
So am I.

29:27.281 --> 29:29.047
Did what I had to do.

29:29.049 --> 29:31.517
I didn't do anything that you didn't do,

29:31.519 --> 29:33.552
gutting that Skitter very intimately.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.187
I want to know what I'm killing

29:35.189 --> 29:37.222
with precision and understanding.

29:37.224 --> 29:38.223
I want to own it.

29:38.225 --> 29:40.125
When you made me take that necklace off,

29:40.127 --> 29:42.461
- you didn't want me getting lost in depression, in Lexi.
- Wait.

29:42.463 --> 29:45.030
No, no, no. I get it.

29:45.032 --> 29:47.366
I just don't want to
get lost in rage, either.

29:48.736 --> 29:51.770
Dad. The Skitters set a trap for you?

29:51.772 --> 29:53.806
It was like they knew we were coming.

29:53.808 --> 29:55.374
Which means that they're being controlled

29:55.376 --> 29:56.575
by an Overlord nearby.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.076
We need to flush him out somehow

29:58.078 --> 30:00.546
while there's no Beamers
or Mechs to protect him.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.880
If you don't mind my saying,

30:01.882 --> 30:05.484
these teams are exhausted from battle.

30:05.486 --> 30:07.953
We can't think in terms of battles
anymore. We're winning a war.

30:07.955 --> 30:11.190
And if there's an Overlord
nearby, that's a game changer.

30:18.213 --> 30:19.579
Okay, we need a little data checklist.

30:19.581 --> 30:20.914
Let's start with you, Hal. Go.

30:20.916 --> 30:22.449
The Skitters we saw were definitely in a...

30:22.451 --> 30:23.917
- what would you call it?
- A feral state.

30:23.919 --> 30:25.718
There's no way they were
under Overlord control.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.320
They were practically eating each other.

30:27.322 --> 30:29.155
Overlords can only control Skitters

30:29.157 --> 30:31.324
within a five-mile range.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.725
Is that true?

30:32.807 --> 30:34.841
Your Skitters were rabid.
Ours were definitely not.

30:34.843 --> 30:36.576
No, they were organized.
They were controlled.

30:36.578 --> 30:37.844
Your Overlord must be

30:37.846 --> 30:40.455
within a five-mile radius of the ambush.

30:40.455 --> 30:42.354
So, he has to be hiding in that circle.

30:42.356 --> 30:44.623
Easy... Maggie and I
crisscross the five-mile radius

30:44.625 --> 30:46.358
until our spikes draw us...
you don't want to be reckless.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.793
You'll draw the enemy right to you,

30:47.795 --> 30:49.428
putting us in danger of
another surprise ambush.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.263
- Glad we could help.
- No, let's just I.D.

30:51.265 --> 30:53.232
every defensible position within this area.

30:53.234 --> 30:55.701
Places big enough for an Overlord
to harbor a Skitter nest for cover.

30:55.703 --> 30:57.636
There's a few structures here
matching that description.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.971
- All right. Let's hear them.
- Weaver: Okay.

30:58.973 --> 31:01.440
Got a canning factory off route 80.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.642
Hotels over here.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.444
Woodrow Wilson High School.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.280
- Shopping mall.
- Wait a second.

31:08.282 --> 31:09.648
What?

31:09.650 --> 31:11.117
What was it?

31:11.119 --> 31:14.653
Got a Woodrow Wilson High School.

31:14.655 --> 31:15.554
That's it.

31:20.828 --> 31:22.661
Anne: Tom?

31:22.663 --> 31:24.163
Tom?

31:24.832 --> 31:27.399
- Hey.
- That's it.

31:27.401 --> 31:29.435
Woodrow Wilson High School.
That's where he's hiding.

31:29.437 --> 31:33.172
All due respect, Professor,
how you know that?

31:33.174 --> 31:35.341
I just do. That's where he is...

31:35.343 --> 31:37.643
Woodrow Wilson High School.
That's where we got to go.

31:40.948 --> 31:43.415
Don't worry. I'm on it.

31:44.285 --> 31:46.485
Mm.

31:48.022 --> 31:49.421
Look, since you're acting a little crazy

31:49.423 --> 31:50.689
and you want me to support you...

31:50.691 --> 31:52.158
I know where we're supposed to go, Anne.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.626
I'm sure of it. I saw it in that memory.

31:53.628 --> 31:55.494
Wait, you never said anything
about Woodrow Wilson to...

31:55.496 --> 31:57.096
Well, it didn't mean anything to me before,

31:57.098 --> 31:58.697
but I saw a bust of Woodrow
Wilson in my bedroom,

31:58.699 --> 32:00.366
and I never owned a bust of Woodrow Wilson.

32:00.368 --> 32:03.002
Is there anything else
that you remember, huh?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.803
Grover Cleveland? Jerry Ford?

32:04.805 --> 32:06.138
I think this is important,

32:06.140 --> 32:07.373
and I don't think we should ignore it.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.874
How do you know it's not a trap?

32:08.876 --> 32:11.544
Because...

32:11.546 --> 32:13.145
Whoever or whatever helped me,

32:13.147 --> 32:15.047
they saved my life and
they brought me back here.

32:15.049 --> 32:16.649
Why set a trap if you've already got me?

32:16.651 --> 32:21.086
I don't know why they gave me this clue.

32:22.557 --> 32:24.390
You already let me go to the moon.

32:24.392 --> 32:26.625
Tell me you're afraid of high school?

32:26.627 --> 32:28.894
[Sighs]

32:28.896 --> 32:30.629
Isn't everybody?

32:32.066 --> 32:34.166
Yeah, fine.

32:34.168 --> 32:36.135
Woodrow Wilson it is.

[Grunts]

32:52.687 --> 32:55.321
[Whirring]

32:58.593 --> 33:00.192
You're totally sure about this?

33:00.194 --> 33:01.660
Damn straight.

33:04.498 --> 33:06.398
Game on.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.334
Ben, Maggie.

33:10.605 --> 33:11.670
Let's go.

33:51.312 --> 33:53.545
[Breathing heavily]

34:35.022 --> 34:37.356
Weaver: All clear.

34:37.358 --> 34:39.024
Anne: You guys feel anything?

34:39.025 --> 34:40.458
No. You?

34:40.460 --> 34:41.760
Nothing.

34:56.710 --> 34:58.877
[Clatter]

35:33.247 --> 35:36.315
[Hissing]

35:36.317 --> 35:37.750
Oh, no.

35:37.752 --> 35:39.385
What is that?

35:39.387 --> 35:41.487
The bleachers.

35:42.823 --> 35:44.256
They're moving.

35:51.332 --> 35:53.499
[Hissing]

35:53.501 --> 35:55.101
Hal! Dingaan!

35:55.103 --> 35:58.037
Let's see what those things can do!

36:01.809 --> 36:04.076
[Skitters hissing, screeching]

36:18.826 --> 36:22.328
[Machine-gun fire in distance]

36:22.330 --> 36:24.663
Wait. Let me go first.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.399
I want to win my own panda bear.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.900
Good girl.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.707
I don't get it.

36:34.709 --> 36:38.911
I could have sworn I heard something.

36:43.317 --> 36:45.017
[Rumbling]

36:45.019 --> 36:47.420
[Screams] Denny!

36:53.528 --> 36:55.261

Ben.

38:25.987 --> 38:28.888
[Breathing heavily]

38:28.890 --> 38:31.624
What the hell are you doing down here?

38:37.966 --> 38:41.567
Ben, disconnect and get out of here.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.002
Let him go right now.

38:43.004 --> 38:45.304
I am unarmed.

38:45.306 --> 38:48.007
Let him go, and then we'll
all leave here peacefully.

38:48.009 --> 38:50.209
You have become a savage killer.

38:50.211 --> 38:52.245
Your son is my only leverage.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.380
Oh, you don't have any leverage.

38:54.382 --> 38:56.315
I could shoot you right now,

38:56.317 --> 38:59.018
and all Ben gets is a headache.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.854
How does that feel...

39:01.856 --> 39:03.689
to be afraid?

39:03.691 --> 39:05.858
- I am not afraid of you.
- Let him go.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.627
I am not afraid.

39:08.529 --> 39:10.096
[Gasps]

39:15.336 --> 39:17.069
I'm not afraid, either.

- I'm fine.

I'm fine.

for what they did to Denny.
