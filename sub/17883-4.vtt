00:01.558 --> 00:02.835
All right, Cash.
Security cam's up.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.440
Target's on the move.
It's now or never.

00:04.606 --> 00:05.790
I'm not feeling it.

00:05.791 --> 00:06.875
Scrub the mission!
Scrub the mission!

00:06.876 --> 00:08.910
No, damn it.
Remember your training. You can do this.

00:08.911 --> 00:11.496
- No, I'm not ready!
- Yes, you are ready!

00:11.497 --> 00:13.781
Go, go, go!

00:22.224 --> 00:23.876
You've liked this girl
for two months. Just do it.

00:24.042 --> 00:25.378
She's just a sandwich girl.

00:25.379 --> 00:27.087
You got this.

00:27.229 --> 00:28.714
Yes. Yes!
Come on!

00:31.233 --> 00:32.467
No. Fail, fail, fail.

00:32.468 --> 00:34.652
Damn it. I've got no game.

00:34.653 --> 00:35.687
Ohh.

00:35.688 --> 00:36.926
<i>Ohh.</i>

00:40.558 --> 00:43.562
♪

01:03.966 --> 01:05.349
I'm not much for sushi,

01:05.351 --> 01:06.884
but I'm really loving
this Japanese guac.

01:06.885 --> 01:08.386
Oh! That's not guac.
Oh.

01:08.387 --> 01:11.055
That's wasabi. Oh, my God.
Isn't your mouth on fire?

01:11.056 --> 01:14.192
No. No, I lost all
my taste buds at Vassar.

01:14.193 --> 01:15.777
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15.778 --> 01:17.645
What's happening, Rog?

01:19.815 --> 01:21.098
What's going on?

01:21.099 --> 01:22.700
What happened
to all the... the revelry

01:22.701 --> 01:24.152
and the mirth
and the merriment?

01:24.153 --> 01:25.320
What are we celebrating?

01:25.321 --> 01:26.704
What's the big <i>occash?</i>

01:26.705 --> 01:28.323
Jones got us sushi.

01:28.324 --> 01:29.791
Jones is the <i>best!</i>

01:29.792 --> 01:32.276
Whoo! The best, bar none.

01:32.277 --> 01:34.045
<i>The</i> a-best...

01:34.046 --> 01:35.330
Jones.

01:35.331 --> 01:39.500
Which one of you is
Jones again? I'm just...

01:39.501 --> 01:41.452
Oh, sweet, sweet v.

01:41.453 --> 01:42.953
Oh.

01:42.954 --> 01:44.922
Oh.
Jones is in Tokyo.

01:44.923 --> 01:47.625
He's
our international sales rep.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.060
He's a legend
in the security business.

01:49.061 --> 01:50.461
Yeah. Remember
that Christmas party he threw?

01:50.462 --> 01:51.461
Ohh.
I got so drunk,

01:51.463 --> 01:53.514
I passed out
at, like, 6:00.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.516
Mm. I know you did.

01:55.517 --> 01:56.901
Jones is the man.

01:56.902 --> 01:58.152
He hooked me up
with V.I.P. Seats

01:58.153 --> 02:01.022
at medieval times...
Free mead, free mutton.

02:01.023 --> 02:03.307
The best part...
Merlin's Subaru broke down,

02:03.308 --> 02:04.859
and I gave him a jump.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.078
This Jones seems like quite
the generous fellow.

02:07.079 --> 02:08.279
Well, wouldn't you be
if you pulled in

02:08.280 --> 02:10.414
the biggest paycheck
in the office?

02:10.416 --> 02:12.633
How do you know
how much money he makes?

02:12.634 --> 02:15.420
Not from opening his mail.

02:15.421 --> 02:17.672
And... and why would
his checks come here

02:17.673 --> 02:19.490
if he lives in Japan?

02:19.491 --> 02:21.676
Well, I just give 'em to oz.
He takes care of it.

02:21.677 --> 02:23.761
I-I don't ask a lot
of questions.

02:23.762 --> 02:25.963
Jones pays for my therapy.
I had a lot of issues

02:25.964 --> 02:27.765
after my mom forgot me
at karate camp.

02:29.017 --> 02:31.052
To Jones,
the man whose sense of fun...

02:31.053 --> 02:33.638
- To Jones!
- Makes us all want to come to work, huh?

02:33.639 --> 02:35.273
Yay, Jones! Wait.
Hold on just a tick.

02:35.274 --> 02:39.610
Um, so you guys want fun?
I can keep up with the Joneses.

02:42.147 --> 02:46.234
Okay, you see this bowl?
This is the fun bowl.

02:46.235 --> 02:47.952
I want you to put your names in that bowl.

02:47.953 --> 02:49.404
I will pick one,

02:49.405 --> 02:52.373
and the winner gets a free lunch
anywhere in this city...

02:54.993 --> 02:56.377
I told you she's okay.
Yeah!

02:56.378 --> 02:58.796
Right? With <i>me!</i>

03:00.699 --> 03:03.033
Take <i>that,</i> Jones!

03:04.753 --> 03:07.158
I have some rather troubling news
that could rock this office

03:07.159 --> 03:08.872
- to its very core.
- Hmm? Hmm.

03:08.874 --> 03:11.426
There is no Jones.

03:11.427 --> 03:15.212
Oz is pocketing his paychecks.
I'm certain of it.

03:15.213 --> 03:18.900
I... cannot... believe this.

03:18.901 --> 03:22.219
No one has put their name
in my bowl.

03:23.822 --> 03:25.890
Well, that chunky receptionist
just walked right past,

03:25.891 --> 03:27.992
didn't put her name in.
Where does she get off?

03:27.993 --> 03:29.894
Firstly, Becky's pregnant.

03:29.895 --> 03:31.913
Secondly, oz is using
Jones' salary

03:31.914 --> 03:33.748
as a personal slush fund.

03:33.749 --> 03:34.899
Okay, that sounds serious.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.284
Why don't you get
on top of that?

03:36.285 --> 03:37.418
I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this bowl situation.

03:37.419 --> 03:38.736
Off with ya.

03:38.737 --> 03:41.405
Okay.
Hello, people of the office.

03:41.406 --> 03:43.374
I just wanted to be sure
that we were all clear

03:43.375 --> 03:45.910
on the free lunch offer.

03:45.911 --> 03:50.047
Please put your name
in the bowl.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.919
Not one person. Okay.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.271
Well, if you need me,

03:57.272 --> 03:59.524
I will be filling the bowl
with an alarming amount

03:59.525 --> 04:01.692
of chocolate chip cookie dough
ice cream.

04:05.263 --> 04:07.598
Hey, V., um, I found this
on the floor.

04:07.599 --> 04:08.616
Hopefully it's not too late
for the drawing.

04:08.617 --> 04:10.617
What?

04:11.119 --> 04:14.271
Cameron! Oh, my gosh.

04:14.272 --> 04:15.740
Somebody get
this man a towel,

04:15.741 --> 04:18.910
because the fun is
gonna explode

04:18.911 --> 04:21.928
all over his face!

04:21.930 --> 04:23.147
There she is,

04:23.148 --> 04:25.666
my sweet 'n' savory
sandwich girl.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.635
If only I knew what to say.

04:27.636 --> 04:29.220
What about "hi"?

04:29.221 --> 04:32.340
Come on. I've seen you
talk to girls before.

04:32.341 --> 04:35.292
Comic-con girls with
unreasonably low standards.

04:35.293 --> 04:38.295
Phoebe's different.
She's a civilian.

04:38.296 --> 04:41.766
Sorry to interrupt. Um, I need
to talk to you about Jones.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.484
Jones. What a guy.

04:43.485 --> 04:45.152
I know he's not real.

04:45.153 --> 04:46.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:46.321 --> 04:47.772
What do you mean,
he's not real?

04:47.773 --> 04:49.574
I've done my homework,
gentlemen,

04:49.575 --> 04:51.308
and not one person
in this office can tell me

04:51.309 --> 04:53.694
what Jones actually
looks like.

04:53.695 --> 04:55.196
Yeah, he's got
the whole thing, you know,

04:55.197 --> 04:57.982
with the eyes and the nose
and the, uh, mouth.

04:57.983 --> 04:59.149
No, he wasn't there.

04:59.150 --> 05:00.835
I picked up the tickets
at will call.

05:00.836 --> 05:03.337
He's tall and handsome...

05:03.338 --> 05:04.822
And has the reproductive organs

05:04.823 --> 05:06.757
of both genders.

05:06.758 --> 05:09.043
And if Jones is not real,
then whose dog am I watching?

05:09.044 --> 05:10.661
No, not the fraggles!

05:10.662 --> 05:12.329
Those are priceless!

05:12.330 --> 05:13.548
Ohh.

05:13.549 --> 05:16.834
How can I stay mad at you,
Jones' dog?

05:16.835 --> 05:18.519
What you're doing is
highly illegal.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.937
I know you're taking
his checks.

05:19.938 --> 05:22.172
Yeah, to deposit for him
while he is abroad.

05:22.173 --> 05:23.507
It's a simple courtesy.

05:23.508 --> 05:26.060
I also take in his trash cans.
Sue me!

05:26.061 --> 05:28.229
Look, look. This can all be
straightened up

05:28.230 --> 05:30.448
with one simple phone call
to Jones, all right?

05:30.449 --> 05:32.650
He should be awake
in about... an hour.

05:32.651 --> 05:35.486
Um, well, that... that's, uh,
a pleasant surprise.

05:35.487 --> 05:36.486
Mm.

05:36.488 --> 05:38.355
I-in an hour then.

05:38.356 --> 05:41.042
Pfft! That woman's crazy.

05:41.043 --> 05:42.627
"There's no Jones."

05:42.628 --> 05:45.615
- There is no Jones.
- What?

05:45.616 --> 05:46.831
I made him up!
But don't worry about it.

05:46.832 --> 05:48.499
I've got it under control.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.001
I-I don't know
what's real anymore.

05:50.002 --> 05:52.470
Uh, wh-whose dog is that?

05:52.471 --> 05:54.171
Hate to break it to you, kid,
but you are the proud owner

05:54.172 --> 05:55.866
of an English bulldog.

05:58.679 --> 06:00.435
Okay, let's do this.

06:00.636 --> 06:02.165
Jones, are you there?

06:02.166 --> 06:04.684
Oh, hey, uh, <i>ohayo gozaimasu</i>

06:04.685 --> 06:07.053
from, uh, you know,
the land of the rising sun.

06:07.054 --> 06:09.172
Same to you. What, uh,
whatcha doin' up there, Jonesy?

06:09.173 --> 06:10.790
Oh, you know, it's all good.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.475
Living it up
here in the far east...

06:12.476 --> 06:14.393
Doing my thing... karaoke,

06:14.394 --> 06:17.763
geishas, ninjas,
samurai... mothra.

06:17.764 --> 06:20.183
We get it. You're in Japan.
Uh, I wanted to take a moment

06:20.184 --> 06:23.603
and introduce you
to our new office manager Molly.

06:23.604 --> 06:25.354
Hello, Molly.

06:25.355 --> 06:27.440
Hello, Mr. Jones.
Mm.

06:27.441 --> 06:29.158
Uh, I just wanted
to introduce myself

06:29.159 --> 06:31.994
to the man traveling
the world for us.

06:31.995 --> 06:33.830
Oh, yeah. I go everywhere.

06:33.831 --> 06:35.331
I get into all types
of trouble.

06:35.332 --> 06:37.617
Oh, really?
Please elaborate.

06:37.618 --> 06:39.702
Just, uh...

06:41.205 --> 06:43.572
Going around searching
for artifacts,

06:43.573 --> 06:45.424
hanging
with my buddy short round,

06:45.425 --> 06:47.460
running from big-ass boulders.

06:47.461 --> 06:49.095
Uh, mostly you deal

06:49.096 --> 06:51.881
with foreign sales
for our company, remember?

06:51.882 --> 06:53.382
Uh, t-totally.

06:53.383 --> 06:55.718
Archeology is just something
that I dabble in.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.436
No, no, no. Not really.

06:57.437 --> 06:58.688
You're right. I don't dabble.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.139
I've got a doctorate,

07:00.140 --> 07:02.058
which has led me
to some great adventures.

07:02.059 --> 07:04.143
Well, three were great.

07:04.144 --> 07:05.862
The last one I did
for the money.

07:05.863 --> 07:07.930
Sayonara, Dr. Jones.

07:07.931 --> 07:09.899
Well...
Thank you, oz.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.901
Uh, I was... I was worried

07:11.902 --> 07:14.453
I was gonna have to call
the FBI on you.

07:14.454 --> 07:15.621
Oh, that wouldn't have mattered.

07:15.622 --> 07:16.706
They think I'm dead anyway.

07:16.707 --> 07:18.958
Did I... did I miss
Jones already?

07:18.959 --> 07:20.076
Well, you know Jones.
If you miss him,

07:20.077 --> 07:22.628
- it's like he was never even here.
- Right.

07:22.629 --> 07:24.797
Uh, afternoon, gentlemen.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.750
Indiana Jones.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.002
You had to make him
Indiana Jones?

07:30.003 --> 07:32.889
You named him Jones.
What was I supposed to do?

07:32.890 --> 07:34.507
James Earl Jones!

07:34.508 --> 07:36.976
Vader!

07:39.462 --> 07:40.813
Oz! Oz.

07:40.814 --> 07:42.815
She's calling back for Jones!

08:23.807 --> 08:26.058
I just don't understand why.

08:26.059 --> 08:29.011
You know, uh...
You can't connect with people

08:29.012 --> 08:31.731
by just blasting fun
in their face.

08:31.732 --> 08:33.316
You're gonna have
to really try

08:33.317 --> 08:35.517
to make an attempt
at getting to know us.

08:35.518 --> 08:37.787
I know everything about
everybody in that office.

08:37.788 --> 08:40.456
Really? What's my last name?

08:40.457 --> 08:42.792
Diaz.

08:42.793 --> 08:45.578
You think I'm Cameron Diaz?

08:45.579 --> 08:46.695
Mm-hmm.

08:46.696 --> 08:48.030
Listen, when I first got
to contra,

08:48.031 --> 08:49.865
I made a point of getting
to know people,

08:49.866 --> 08:52.034
and so now...
Now they trust me.

08:52.035 --> 08:54.136
Oh, my gosh. Cameron, yes.

08:54.137 --> 08:56.339
Thank you in advance
for providing me

08:56.340 --> 08:59.225

08:59.226 --> 09:00.476
What are you talking about?

09:00.477 --> 09:03.262
Cheat sheets! Yes!
You're gonna draw up

09:03.263 --> 09:06.182
dossiers on everybody
and give 'em to me,

09:06.183 --> 09:09.885
my fine Mr. P...

09:09.886 --> 09:12.054
Don't tell me.
I know it starts with a "p."

09:12.055 --> 09:13.105
Pameron!

09:13.106 --> 09:15.658
You think
I'm Cameron pameron?

09:15.659 --> 09:17.743
♪ graduation,
happy graduation ♪

09:17.744 --> 09:19.779

Go away.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.067
Jones, you sweet bastard.
Mmm.

09:25.068 --> 09:26.568
Mmm. Ohh.
If you were here,

09:26.569 --> 09:28.254
I'd kiss you.
Mm. I kissed him once.

09:28.255 --> 09:29.505
True story.

09:29.506 --> 09:31.207
Whoa, whoa.
Uh, these are from Jones?

09:31.208 --> 09:32.341
They're
figgy pudding truffles

09:32.342 --> 09:33.876
from england.
Huh.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.795
When I talked to him last night,
I got a bit emotional

09:35.796 --> 09:37.630
and told him I was feeling
a bit homesick,

09:37.631 --> 09:38.764
so...

09:38.765 --> 09:40.132
You talked to Jones
last night?

09:40.133 --> 09:41.384
Mm.
Oh.

09:41.385 --> 09:42.885
Via video conference.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.186
We've become
quite good friends,

09:44.187 --> 09:46.022
and we're really helping
each other out.

09:46.023 --> 09:47.356
I told him
I was missing mummy,

09:47.357 --> 09:49.758
and, well, he's having
girl troubles

09:49.759 --> 09:50.976
and searching
for the staff of Ra.

09:52.612 --> 09:53.979
Well, I certainly hope
he finds it,

09:53.980 --> 09:56.816
'cause I know exactly where
I'm going to put it.

09:58.101 --> 09:59.902
You're video chatting
with her? How?!

09:59.903 --> 10:02.621
Chill! It's just a little
motion-capture technology

10:02.622 --> 10:03.739
that I cooked up.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.792
It's like gollum,
but better.

10:06.793 --> 10:08.444
<i>Women love confidence.</i>

10:08.445 --> 10:10.279
Yeah,
that's kind of a problem.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.580
<i>I'm kinda lacking
in that department.</i>

10:11.581 --> 10:13.749
Oh, please. Who's the one
that didn't give up

10:13.750 --> 10:15.334
when that rope bridge
gave out?

10:15.335 --> 10:16.419
Me.

10:16.420 --> 10:17.553
And who's the one
who kept his cool

10:17.554 --> 10:18.671
when he fell into that pit
of snakes,

10:18.672 --> 10:20.756
even though he was terrified
of them?

10:20.757 --> 10:21.924
<i>That was me.</i>

10:21.925 --> 10:24.894
Well, Henry, this woman is
your snake.

10:24.895 --> 10:25.928
You're right.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.629
<i>This woman is my snake.</i>

10:27.630 --> 10:29.565
<i>Dayum!</i>

10:29.566 --> 10:32.485
Do you realize she is giving me
the best dating advice ever?

10:32.486 --> 10:33.853
I got some advice
for you, too.

10:33.854 --> 10:35.905
Shut it down,
or I'm gonna shut you down!

10:35.906 --> 10:37.022
<i>comprende?</i>

10:37.023 --> 10:38.991
Yeah.
Fine.

10:51.746 --> 10:52.813
Here's your cheat sheet.

10:52.814 --> 10:55.116
Oh, thanks, cam...
Wait a minute.

10:55.117 --> 10:58.119
Names and hometowns?
Cameron, you're a hacker.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.753
I want the good stuff,
you know,

10:59.754 --> 11:01.422
everybody's deepest,
darkest secrets,

11:01.423 --> 11:02.756
all of the really...

11:02.757 --> 11:04.542
Bad, bad things
that they've ever done

11:04.543 --> 11:06.794
in their <i>whole</i> lives.

11:06.795 --> 11:09.096
You know, so I can use it
to make 'em like me.

11:09.297 --> 11:12.132
But I thought this was about
you being a better boss.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.367
- Is that what I told you?
- Yes.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.534
- And you liked that?
- Yes.

11:14.535 --> 11:15.586
Then that is what I said.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.804
No.

11:16.805 --> 11:18.789
Would it help
if I ordered you to do it?

11:18.790 --> 11:20.341
Uh...
All right. Fine.

11:20.342 --> 11:23.310
I'll... just give me an hour,
and I'll come up with something.

11:23.311 --> 11:27.514
Oh, I'm gonna kill it
<i>so hard at this party!</i>

11:28.833 --> 11:30.234
What party?

11:33.188 --> 11:36.156
"Contra securi inaugural

11:36.157 --> 11:39.410

11:39.411 --> 11:41.028
Yeah, it's a little somethin'
for everyone.

11:41.029 --> 11:42.946
We're gonna pour some goof juice
into these stiffs,

11:42.947 --> 11:44.865
and then I'm gonna use
all the little nuggets

11:44.866 --> 11:47.751
that you're gonna give me,
and by the end of the night,

11:47.752 --> 11:50.754
I am gonna be covered
in friends.

11:52.207 --> 11:54.842
Oh, that's sad
Cash can't me it.

11:54.843 --> 11:56.576

12:02.467 --> 12:04.084

Not a fake thing.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.854
Hey, folks!

12:06.855 --> 12:09.256
Couple things I think I might
have left off the invite.

12:09.257 --> 12:12.259
There's <i>totes</i> gonna be
a frozen marg and daq machine.

12:12.260 --> 12:15.863
The other thing I think I might
have forgotten to mention is

12:15.864 --> 12:17.648
if you don't come to the party,
you're fired.

12:19.484 --> 12:22.369

What's the emergency?

13:27.268 --> 13:29.336
<i>I'm at a charity gala,

13:29.337 --> 13:30.888

13:38.363 --> 13:39.897
Okay. Bye.

13:41.149 --> 13:42.849
Jones has just been fired.
No! No.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.117
Oz, I ed him.

13:44.118 --> 13:45.486
What can I say?

13:45.487 --> 13:47.237
He was caught selling secrets
to a rival company.

13:47.238 --> 13:49.323
Yeah, but what you don't know
Jones is a double a.

13:49.324 --> 13:50.407
He was working for us
the whole time.

13:50.408 --> 13:51.858
He's a hero.
He <i>was</i> a hero.

13:51.859 --> 13:53.860
Two hours ago, he got hit
by a high-speed bullet train

13:53.861 --> 13:55.078
- in Kyoto.
- But surprisingly,

13:55.079 --> 13:56.663
he only sustained
minor injuries.

13:56.664 --> 13:57.998
But the emotional trauma
he suffered sent him

13:57.999 --> 13:59.333
into cardiac arrest.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.001
- He died!
- For two and a half minutes,

14:01.002 --> 14:02.219
before a rogue surgeon

14:02.220 --> 14:03.837
performed an emergency
baboon heart transplant,

14:03.838 --> 14:06.974
gave him a new lease on life
and crazy-ass monkey strength!

14:06.975 --> 14:08.842
Yet moments later,
he tragically choked on a banana

14:08.843 --> 14:10.978
and was pronounced dead
by a team of renowned doctors.

14:10.979 --> 14:12.145
- Well, th...
- His last request

14:12.146 --> 14:13.514
was that
his ashes be scattered...

14:13.515 --> 14:14.565
- Yeah, but...
- <i>In</i> an active volcano!

14:14.566 --> 14:16.233
Oh, I can do this all night.

14:16.234 --> 14:18.652
Baboon heart? Ridiculous.
What are you, a novice?

14:18.653 --> 14:20.187
You fraud!

14:20.188 --> 14:23.056
<i>You</i> and <i>you!</i>
Fraudulent fraudsters!

14:23.057 --> 14:24.942
Well done, Molly.

14:24.943 --> 14:26.443
How did we tip our hand?

14:26.444 --> 14:27.911
By showing his.

14:27.912 --> 14:29.530
Okay, uh, yeah.

14:29.531 --> 14:31.398
<i>I'll try. Thanks.</i>

14:31.399 --> 14:33.400
<i>Later. Okay.
Uh, uh, later. Bye. Bye.</i>

14:34.569 --> 14:37.287
Damn. My gloves.

14:37.288 --> 14:38.755
Does this mean
you're gonna turn us in?

14:38.756 --> 14:40.340
No. Not this evening.

14:40.341 --> 14:42.593
I don't want to turn

murder-mystery-cirque-du-so-
game-night-comedy-roast

14:44.629 --> 14:46.930
into some sort of... spectacle.

14:46.931 --> 14:49.299
All right!
And now for the main event.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.551
I hope everybody
is in the mood

14:50.552 --> 14:52.519
for a good old-fashioned
office roast!

14:52.520 --> 14:54.104
Whoo!

14:54.105 --> 14:56.089
I'm not really very good
at this kind of thing,

14:56.090 --> 14:58.642
but I'm gonna give it whirl.
All right.

14:58.643 --> 15:02.029
Well, we've certainly got
a lot of food here tonight.

15:02.030 --> 15:04.314
Speaking of food,

15:04.315 --> 15:05.616
Ricky has crabs!

15:06.818 --> 15:09.870
Up next,
our accountant buddy revell,

15:09.871 --> 15:12.105
king of the C.P.A.S...

15:12.106 --> 15:14.825
Or should I say, "D.U.I.s"?

15:14.826 --> 15:17.294
Hey, everybody.
Look over there. It's old preggy Becky.

15:17.295 --> 15:20.714
Does anybody here know
who the father is? No?

15:20.715 --> 15:22.449
Okay. Sorry, Becky. I tried.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.968
Oh, and the I.T. Guys are here.
The only hooking up

15:24.969 --> 15:27.087
they're doing is
my wi-fi connection.

15:27.088 --> 15:28.388
Oh, except for Al.

15:28.389 --> 15:30.340
Yeah, he's got a sex doll.
That counts.

15:30.341 --> 15:35.062
"I'm Irene, and I'm the whore
of my senior center."

15:35.063 --> 15:37.615
Got an awesome tramp stamp.
You would not guess that.

15:37.616 --> 15:40.201
The carpet does not match
the drapes.

15:40.202 --> 15:42.503
He has sock under his bed
named "Jennifer."

15:42.504 --> 15:43.503
She turned him gay.

15:46.157 --> 15:48.775
Why all the sourpusses?
This is a roast.

15:48.776 --> 15:50.827
It's supposed to be fun.
I mean, I know it's all true,

15:50.828 --> 15:53.830
because I got
this information from Cameron.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.501
Uh, uh...

15:57.502 --> 15:58.952
Everybody come quick!

15:58.953 --> 16:01.755
There's another dead body
in the parking lot!

16:01.756 --> 16:03.657
There's about to be
two of them.

16:06.933 --> 16:07.983
Yo, what's up, man?

16:07.984 --> 16:08.983
You got something
on your back.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.916
"I heart balls."

16:13.917 --> 16:16.101
Well, that's the least offensive
thing i've "hearted" today.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.493
I am the most hated man
in this office.

16:18.494 --> 16:19.595
At least you're not
an accomplice

16:19.696 --> 16:21.914
to fraud, embezzlement,
and tax evasion.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.782
Ohh. I prefer your thing.

16:24.783 --> 16:28.303
Okay. Come on.
Really? Point-blank?

16:28.304 --> 16:30.388
Hey, man! What did I do?

16:30.389 --> 16:32.891
He sucks, and you're
his friend, so you suck.

16:34.143 --> 16:36.011
Oh! Oh! Ow!
Ow. Aah.

16:36.012 --> 16:37.345
For the past ten years,

16:37.346 --> 16:40.899
oz has been using Jones
as a slush fund

16:40.900 --> 16:43.101
for lavish gifts
and office parties.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.237
Just one problem.
You have no proof.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.489
I caught you,
and you admitted it.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.140
Well, it was worth a shot.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.526
Once again, let me say
that I am speechless.

16:51.527 --> 16:52.777
Good.

16:52.778 --> 16:56.414
I throw a lovely party
for these <i>boobs,</i>

16:56.415 --> 16:57.982
and they still don't like me.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.117
I mean, that is very hurtful.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.869
I'm out. You're the boss.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.320
You deal with it.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.421
Hs)

17:03.422 --> 17:05.123
All right, all right,
all right!

17:06.157 --> 17:08.326
I am the boss.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.511
Let's just get this
over with.

17:09.512 --> 17:10.877
It's going to be
very uncomfortable.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.380
Okay.

17:12.381 --> 17:15.349
Oswald, do you like me?

17:15.351 --> 17:17.335
Ronnie, I work for you now.

17:17.336 --> 17:18.335
Doesn't matter
what I think.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.055
Well, it matters to me.

17:20.056 --> 17:22.723
Uh, look, I will, uh,

17:22.724 --> 17:24.675
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.844
I created Jones
for a reason.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.313
See, I realized
when I started this place,

17:28.314 --> 17:30.949
I could not be their friend
<i>and</i> their boss,

17:30.950 --> 17:34.819
but Jones...
Now <i>he</i> lets me be both.

17:36.072 --> 17:38.823
I get it.

17:38.824 --> 17:41.042
You still haven't answered
my question, though.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.714
Eh.

17:45.715 --> 17:47.048
You're growing on me.

17:50.419 --> 17:53.087
Um, uh, hey, everyone!

17:53.088 --> 17:54.455
Uh, can I get
your attention, please?

17:56.425 --> 17:58.593
Guys?

17:58.594 --> 18:01.095
Really? A stapler? Come on.

18:01.096 --> 18:03.681
Look, I-I know
I'm the only one

18:03.682 --> 18:05.099
who didn't get roasted
the other day,

18:05.100 --> 18:08.303
so I-I'm gonna roast myself,
okay?

18:08.304 --> 18:09.754
So here goes.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.689
When I was born,
my doctor told my mother

18:11.690 --> 18:13.758
it was normal for me
to have three...

18:13.759 --> 18:17.395
Excuse me, everyone, but I have
an important announcement.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.063
It wasn't Cameron
who supplied me

18:19.064 --> 18:22.534
with
my hilarious roast material.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.285
It was Jones.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.074
It w... it was. It was Jones.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.326
I didn't want to say anything

18:31.327 --> 18:34.078
because I know how much
you all idolize him.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.413
How could Jones do that?

18:35.414 --> 18:37.832
Because he's selfish
and a bad kisser.

18:37.833 --> 18:38.832
Ah.

18:39.969 --> 18:41.419
So are we good?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.254
Um, yeah.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.422
Can I take you
to Funanigan's?

18:44.423 --> 18:46.507
It's my birthday.

18:46.508 --> 18:49.060
Cameron, that is so sweet
of you.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.478
That really warms
my heart...

18:50.479 --> 18:51.896
But no,

18:51.897 --> 18:53.097
because I happen to know

18:53.098 --> 18:54.983
that your birthday is
December 1st.

18:54.984 --> 18:56.768
Impressed?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.403
It's April 6th.

19:06.612 --> 19:07.645
What's up?
Go away.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.813
But I...
I'm not interested.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.982
I'm sorry.
Sorry?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.918
I've been baring my soul
to a computer-generated jerk.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.787
"Sorry" is not gonna cut it.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.321
I didn't become Jones
to mess with you.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.490
I felt like we were helping
each other.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.658
Except my problems
were real,

19:20.659 --> 19:22.260
whereas you were making up
stories

19:22.261 --> 19:24.762
about the love of your life,
"Marion."

19:24.763 --> 19:27.048
Her name is Phoebe.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.718
She's the sandwich girl.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.106
I have work to do.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.475
But, uh...

20:16.732 --> 20:22.731
♪

20:33.582 --> 20:36.951
Ooh!
Oh! Sorry about that!

20:36.952 --> 20:38.453
Coming through.

20:42.624 --> 20:43.623
Hey!

21:00.092 --> 21:03.444
Epic fail! Epic fail!
Fail! Fail!

21:03.445 --> 21:06.047
Somebody help me!
I know you guys can hear me!

21:06.048 --> 21:08.499
Oh, my God.
I can't even feel my arm!

21:08.500 --> 21:10.201
I'm losing circulation!

21:10.202 --> 21:12.737
Ohh!

21:12.738 --> 21:17.291
Oh, thank you, lord. Ohh.
Oh, thank yo ohh.

21:21.296 --> 21:23.131
You'll get her
next time, Jones.

21:23.132 --> 21:26.134
Ohh. Ohh.

21:26.135 --> 21:27.284
Come on.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.804
Let's go get you patched up.

21:32.475 --> 21:36.480
