WEBVTT

00:13.289 --> 00:15.739
Uh, it would involve some light
cleaning, light ironing,

00:15.774 --> 00:18.432
and light cooking.
Can you drive?

00:18.811 --> 00:20.089
Great. Light driving.

00:20.296 --> 00:22.677
And, would you want to live in,

00:22.712 --> 00:24.679
or do you have a family
of your own?

00:24.714 --> 00:28.062
No, I got a family of my own.
Two little boys.

00:28.338 --> 00:31.134
- I have a photo.
- No, it's okay. I believe you.

00:31.169 --> 00:33.595
And sorry the agency didn't say,
what would be your hourly rate?

00:33.619 --> 00:37.244
It's 18 an hour,
and then overtime is 20 an hour.

00:37.658 --> 00:39.556
- Net.
- Huh?

00:39.591 --> 00:41.627
Yeah, well, London is expensive.

00:41.662 --> 00:44.285
I'd be traveling
in from Pinner. And then

00:44.320 --> 00:46.839
I've gotta pay for childcare.
And food is...

00:46.874 --> 00:49.152
What... what... what...
What do you do for childcare?

00:49.187 --> 00:51.187
- Well, I got a nanny, innit?
- You've got a nanny?

00:51.361 --> 00:53.605
- Yeah. Course.
- Sorry, just out of interest,

00:53.639 --> 00:55.365
wha... wha...
What is her hourly rate...

00:55.400 --> 00:56.480
What do you pay your nanny?

00:56.608 --> 00:58.644
Mm. Not a lot, she's Irish.

00:58.955 --> 01:00.370
Oh, sorry...
Out of interest again,

01:00.405 --> 01:01.685
where... where did you find her?

01:01.854 --> 01:05.237
From an agency
called "Mother's Help"...

01:05.893 --> 01:06.893
are you...

01:07.205 --> 01:09.276
writing this down in your phone?

01:09.310 --> 01:11.864
No, no. No, I'm...
I'm just setting a reminder

01:11.899 --> 01:13.590
for something
I need to do later. What...

01:13.625 --> 01:15.489
What... what was the name
of the agency again?

01:15.523 --> 01:18.906
Mother's Help.
It's on Fair Street in uh, Pi...

01:19.527 --> 01:22.668
- You are writing this down.
- Okay, yes! Sorry, I am, yes.

01:22.703 --> 01:24.774
I'’m sorry. Do you know
how to get the bips

01:24.808 --> 01:26.741
off an iPhone 6s?
That bip noise.

01:26.776 --> 01:27.776
The bip bip?

01:28.985 --> 01:30.411
Oh, you're leaving. Well,
thank you so much for coming.

01:30.435 --> 01:32.402
Actually I...
I do think that Pinner is a bit

01:32.437 --> 01:34.577
of a schlep so I'm afraid
it's a no, for me.

01:34.784 --> 01:37.097
Yeah, no shit,
it's a no from me too.

01:37.338 --> 01:38.626
That said, would you
be interested in

01:38.650 --> 01:39.927
a nanny share at all?

01:39.961 --> 01:41.825
You don'’t have to answer now.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.896
Have a thinkity think..

01:47.693 --> 01:50.869
I've gone into settings,
hold on, wait...

01:52.215 --> 01:54.217
- yep, I've gone into settings.
- Control center.

01:54.252 --> 01:56.150
- Right.
- Sounds and Haptics.

01:56.185 --> 01:57.220
Haptics?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.258
- Is that settings?
- I've gone to

02:00.292 --> 02:01.852
- settings.
- Just bloody give it to me.

02:02.639 --> 02:03.951
- Who is that guy?
- What?

02:04.710 --> 02:05.780
I don'’t know.

02:06.402 --> 02:08.438
Is that little Sophia
on his lap?

02:08.956 --> 02:10.682
Where'’d he spring from?

02:11.855 --> 02:13.409
Why'’s he at the big table?

02:13.443 --> 02:15.756
Oh shit!
I missed a call from work.

02:16.274 --> 02:17.827
I'’m organizing this
really big event.

02:17.861 --> 02:18.861
It'’s a real step up.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.495
I'’m doing
an onstage introduction

02:20.519 --> 02:21.520
with Malcolm Spender.

02:22.314 --> 02:23.522
Who's Malcolm Spender?

02:25.766 --> 02:27.526
I just assumed everyone
knew who he was.

02:28.389 --> 02:30.702
- The war photographer.
- Whatever.

02:31.979 --> 02:33.222
Whatever?

02:34.257 --> 02:36.397
What does that mean?
Do you know his work Liz?

02:36.811 --> 02:39.642
No, but war photographers.

02:41.885 --> 02:43.577
I... actually...
I just need to talk to

02:43.611 --> 02:44.819
Amanda about the, uh...

02:45.786 --> 02:48.029
I... I just need to tell them
about...

02:48.064 --> 02:49.859
- Oh, bravo!
- Morning, ladies.

02:50.791 --> 02:51.895
Just an update.

02:53.276 --> 02:55.416
Uh, on the old Park Fun Run,

02:55.623 --> 02:57.049
uh, apparently
they were thinking about

02:57.073 --> 02:59.765
canceling
the under 12's 2K but...

03:00.766 --> 03:03.390
I think they've changed
their minds.

03:04.908 --> 03:06.462
J... just passing that along.

03:07.877 --> 03:09.016
Hello.

03:10.155 --> 03:13.331
Amanda, are you gonna introduce
me to your new friend?

03:14.366 --> 03:16.851
Kevin this is Sophia's dad,
James.

03:17.542 --> 03:21.373
James is an old friend.
God, we go back years, don't we?

03:21.408 --> 03:24.445
We were both front of house
at Bibendum, back in the day.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.034
But he's well past that now
aren'’t you? You are!

03:27.483 --> 03:29.588
He runs Bobble Nation,
the online knitwear company.

03:29.623 --> 03:32.004
And he is married
to the very beautiful Thandie,

03:32.522 --> 03:34.455
who's also a very dear friend
of mine.

03:38.563 --> 03:39.564
James, this is Kevin.

03:40.668 --> 03:42.463
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi, James.

03:42.498 --> 03:44.465
I was... I was just
telling everyone about the...

03:44.707 --> 03:47.330
under 12's 2K
almost getting cancelled

03:47.365 --> 03:49.263
but any...
Anyway, you've probably heard.

03:50.989 --> 03:53.750
Nice to have another
stay at home dad on the streets.

03:54.095 --> 03:55.821
- SAD.
- Huh?

03:55.856 --> 03:57.547
Stay at home dad.

03:57.582 --> 03:58.755
SAD.

03:59.894 --> 04:02.725
Sad! It's that I never...
I never... never thought of that.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.969
But I... I'm more
of an "Out and about dad."

04:07.937 --> 04:09.041
OAAD.

04:13.114 --> 04:14.599
That's two things
we've got in common.

04:14.806 --> 04:16.773
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- Both SAD,

04:17.153 --> 04:18.879
and married to hotties.

04:20.639 --> 04:22.607
Both bagged ourselves
a couple of hot wives

04:22.641 --> 04:23.780
by the sounds of it.

04:24.816 --> 04:25.816
Anyway, uh...

04:26.887 --> 04:28.589
See you all at little
Samantha's party tomorrow?

04:28.613 --> 04:29.752
We'll... we'll all be there.

04:29.993 --> 04:31.409
Yep,
we will be there, too, Kevin.

04:31.650 --> 04:32.858
Great!

04:34.101 --> 04:36.501
And if you wanna chat or say hi,
I'm... I'm usually at the...

04:36.655 --> 04:38.381
- Toilet table.
- That table...

04:38.416 --> 04:40.141
- The toilet table.
- It's... it's not the

04:40.176 --> 04:42.834
toilet table, Amanda,
it's next to the drinks.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.110
Oh.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.270
If anything,
it'’s the fridge table.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.843
I think it's cruel
to call it a pool party,

05:26.878 --> 05:29.052
because when people
say pool party, you think,

05:29.087 --> 05:30.537
"Oh, Jonathan Ross's house."

05:31.848 --> 05:34.920
Oh, who, who does this?
Deliberately?

05:35.127 --> 05:36.508
Oh, no, I love a pool party.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.097
Probably 'cause I never went
to them as a kid.

05:39.787 --> 05:42.065
I never even got in a paddling
pool till I was 15.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.722
- What's Liz doing?
- Oh, she's, uh,

05:43.757 --> 05:44.861
found some guy's wallet.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.587
Think she's trying
to get it back to him.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.522
- Hi, Liz.
- All right?

05:51.005 --> 05:52.697
Why have you come
as Hillary Clinton?

05:53.732 --> 05:56.908
Oh, um no, I just... I... I wanted
to make a good impression

05:56.942 --> 05:58.806
on... on Malcolm.
The war photographer.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.785
What'’s this? What's this?
Why you'’re doing this?

06:01.809 --> 06:02.948
Well, war photographers.

06:02.983 --> 06:04.087
Think they're all that.

06:04.122 --> 06:05.054
Think they're all that?

06:05.088 --> 06:07.159
"War photographers
think they're all that?"

06:08.126 --> 06:10.128
Liz. He works in disaster zones.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.924
He spends his whole life
looking into the abyss.

06:13.131 --> 06:14.132
Give me a break.

06:15.098 --> 06:16.824
I'd hate to look into an abyss.

06:18.067 --> 06:20.621
- Did you find your wallet guy?
- Just called him.

06:20.828 --> 06:22.796
He'’s gonna text me
when he'’s done with work

06:22.830 --> 06:23.830
and we'’re gonna meet.

06:24.038 --> 06:25.454
He does have a fit voice.

06:25.488 --> 06:26.768
Know what else I like about him?

06:26.938 --> 06:29.389
He has no loyalty cards. At all.

06:29.906 --> 06:32.426
Just got three cards,
Gym, Visa, Oyster.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.084
- You'’ve got to respect that.
- What does he do?

06:35.981 --> 06:37.431
I don'’t know. I'll text him.

06:37.466 --> 06:38.777
Kev mate, you... you all right

06:38.812 --> 06:40.092
to take mine back
to yours after?

06:40.123 --> 06:41.539
- I'll get you back.
- Actually,

06:41.573 --> 06:43.230
that'd be great,
'cause I need tomorrow

06:43.264 --> 06:45.197
afternoon off
to pick up my mother-in-law.

06:45.612 --> 06:47.234
She had a nasty fall
a few weeks ago,

06:47.268 --> 06:49.754
and I have to take her
for a checkup at the hospital.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.514
Could you collect
my kids after school?

06:51.549 --> 06:53.033
Yeah, yeah absolutely, yeah.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.011
You know, I... I can't do
that tomorrow afternoon but

06:55.035 --> 06:56.485
next time she has a fall,
absolutely.

06:56.761 --> 06:58.210
Right, I'’d better be going.
Bye!

06:58.245 --> 06:59.522
Where are you going, huh?

07:00.592 --> 07:01.455
- Where are you going?
- I've got to pick up

07:01.490 --> 07:03.146
some bits and bobs
before the event,

07:03.181 --> 07:04.861
- some deodorant...
- No, no, you can't go.

07:04.976 --> 07:06.115
What'’s she talking about?

07:06.149 --> 07:07.944
You have to supervise
at a pool party.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.845
- What are you talking about?
- It's one adult per two kids.

07:11.879 --> 07:14.468
- It's not a drop off?
- No, it's not a drop off,

07:14.503 --> 07:17.022
otherwise I wouldn't be standing
here inhaling verruca fumes.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.955
Oh, come on!

07:19.956 --> 07:20.957
Jesus, right...

07:23.339 --> 07:26.515
Okay. It's fine.
That's fine.

07:26.998 --> 07:28.941
I'll just... I'’ll watch
from the viewing platform

07:28.965 --> 07:30.245
and then I'’ll leg it. That's...

07:30.760 --> 07:32.210
it'’s... fine.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.143
Boys and girls.

07:35.316 --> 07:37.491
Hands up if you'’re here
for Samantha's birthday party?

07:37.733 --> 07:39.769
Okay, great. Mums and dads,
if I can get you all

07:39.804 --> 07:41.564
just to start to line up,

07:41.840 --> 07:43.739
and just as a reminder
for health and safety,

07:43.773 --> 07:46.051
I will need one adult
in the water

07:46.086 --> 07:48.088
with every two non-swimmers.
All right?

07:48.122 --> 07:49.814
What does she mean,
"In the water?"

07:49.848 --> 07:51.712
- You have to get in the pool.
- What?

07:51.747 --> 07:53.300
What? No. You can do that.

07:53.334 --> 07:55.889
No. It's... it's one adult
per two non-swimmers.

07:55.923 --> 07:58.132
I'm one adult
and there's four non-swimmers.

07:58.374 --> 07:59.996
- Five.
- Yeah, yeah,

08:00.031 --> 08:01.964
but does anyone really count?
Really?

08:02.274 --> 08:03.274
She does.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.933
No. I can't do

08:06.555 --> 08:09.627
Look at me. I can'’t.
I can'’t. My hair, my jacket!

08:10.041 --> 08:11.974
Maybe don't wear your suit
in to the pool.

08:12.008 --> 08:14.597
Just try not to get your head
in the water. I never do.

08:14.873 --> 08:16.565
Anyway I don'’t...
I don't have a swimsuit.

08:16.806 --> 08:18.808
I'’ve got my wife's costume
in my bag?

08:19.153 --> 08:20.776
The gusset sticker's
still attached

08:20.810 --> 08:22.571
so it's... it's hygienic as hell.

08:22.605 --> 08:24.745
Kevin, why have you
got your wife's swimsuit?

08:24.780 --> 08:26.126
Well, just in case, I suppose.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.440
You got tampons
in there as well?

08:27.679 --> 08:28.679
What size?

08:29.370 --> 08:32.201
Okay. Okay. It's fine.
It's fine.

08:32.788 --> 08:34.790
I can dangle my legs
in the water.

08:35.066 --> 08:36.895
Or, I can just
stand at the side.

08:41.382 --> 08:43.281
- He'’s a scaffolder.
- What'’s so funny?

08:44.109 --> 08:46.111
Just, the way he said it,
"Scaffolder."

08:46.387 --> 08:47.387
Dry.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.706
This way! This way!

08:57.744 --> 08:58.779
Ugh!

08:59.193 --> 09:01.161
Push through! Push through!

09:11.309 --> 09:14.243
- Where shall I put my jacket?
- Ugh, just here. Give it to me.

09:17.142 --> 09:18.661
- Have you got...
- Yeah.

09:18.696 --> 09:20.145
Look in the bag, sweetheart,
the bag.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.140
This is cold, this is cold...
Get away from there!

09:22.389 --> 09:23.666
Don'’t touch that!

09:27.049 --> 09:30.190
Hangers? Did anyone
bring a hanger with them?

09:31.329 --> 09:32.986
A wire one will do!

09:34.125 --> 09:36.092
Anyone? Shit.

09:40.338 --> 09:43.410
- Hello, Keith. All right?
- It's Kevin.

09:45.412 --> 09:46.772
What'’s the first rule
of swimming?

09:48.415 --> 09:50.693
The first rule of swimming
is always blow

09:50.728 --> 09:53.385
- your arm bands up at home!
- Yeah, I'’ve got this, actually.

09:55.767 --> 09:57.458
I do usually pre-blow,

09:57.493 --> 09:59.875
it'’s just I ran out of time
wrapping Samantha'’s present.

10:00.254 --> 10:01.428
Oh, yes.

10:04.983 --> 10:06.329
Nice togs, by the way.

10:06.847 --> 10:07.986
Are they the pair

10:08.021 --> 10:09.160
that Nick Clegg wore

10:09.194 --> 10:11.434
- on holiday that time?
- Yeah, they are, actually, yeah.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.371
He's a great casual dresser.
Clegg.

10:13.923 --> 10:16.270
Yeah if I was a woman
I think he'’d be my guilty crush.

10:16.719 --> 10:17.719
Or gay.

10:18.445 --> 10:20.240
- What?
- But if... If you were gay

10:20.274 --> 10:21.724
he could be
your guilty crush too.

10:22.518 --> 10:25.038
- Okay, good one.
- See you out there.

10:25.348 --> 10:26.867
- Yes, see you out there.
- Okay.

10:27.281 --> 10:28.351
Loser.

10:31.838 --> 10:32.839
Excuse me.

10:34.772 --> 10:36.049
Excuse me? Hello?

10:36.325 --> 10:38.154
Hello, anyone there?
Please could you?

10:38.741 --> 10:39.741
Could you... thank you.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.780
Hello. Sorry.
Do you have long lockers?

10:43.332 --> 10:44.644
- What?
- Long lockers?

10:44.989 --> 10:46.507
Lockers that are... long lockers,

10:46.542 --> 10:48.406
if you have something long
to hang up.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.063
Full length lockers,
like a wardrobe.

10:50.097 --> 10:51.754
My jackets
getting very crumpled.

10:51.789 --> 10:53.169
It's... it's a designer jacket.

10:53.549 --> 10:54.964
Why you wearing
a designer jacket

10:54.999 --> 10:56.172
to a swimming pool?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.003
- Do you have long lockers?
- No.

11:00.349 --> 11:02.351
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for your help.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.422
Thank you. Good day to you.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.082
Sorry, could you?
Could you just...

11:09.116 --> 11:10.462
Could you just...

11:10.497 --> 11:11.497
Thank you.

11:16.503 --> 11:18.678
Manus, just stay
where I can see you. Okay?

11:20.196 --> 11:22.405
- Have you seen James?
- Oh, I think I saw him heading

11:22.440 --> 11:23.993
- to the men's.
- Oh, we're supposed

11:24.028 --> 11:25.685
to meet outside. We go way back.

11:26.237 --> 11:27.859
He's such a wonderful guy.

11:28.204 --> 11:30.068
I'm very good friends
with his wife Thandie.

11:30.103 --> 11:31.449
You said that when we were...

11:31.483 --> 11:33.037
- Did he ask where I was?
- No.

11:34.245 --> 11:35.315
Yes.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.089
Oh, God, your legs look lovely
and smooth, Amanda.

11:40.113 --> 11:41.113
Oh, yeah.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.738
Between you and me, Anne,
I've had everything

11:44.773 --> 11:46.947
from here down lasered off.

11:47.879 --> 11:48.879
Not a wisp.

11:49.985 --> 11:52.435
- God that'’s terrific.
- You should think about it, hon.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.375
I don't wanna miss
wallet guy's call.

12:01.859 --> 12:04.068
My plan
is to meet outside a pub.

12:04.102 --> 12:05.552
So when I give him
his wallet back,

12:05.586 --> 12:07.209
we can go into the pub.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.936
- So, looks like I've got a date.
- That'’s not a date.

12:09.970 --> 12:12.179
You'’ve got his wallet.
That'’s like a hostage.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.594
If he still wants to meet

12:13.629 --> 12:15.044
after you give the wallet back,

12:15.079 --> 12:16.597
- that'’s like a date.
- I dunno,

12:16.632 --> 12:18.530
I'm really starting
to like this guy, Julia.

12:18.565 --> 12:20.498
God, have you ever
looked directly into

12:20.532 --> 12:22.811
a pool filter?
It's just full of pubes and...

12:24.260 --> 12:25.399
skin and plasters.

12:27.022 --> 12:28.620
I'’ve just got to look
prepared to go in.

12:28.644 --> 12:31.509
I'm just gonna sit on the edge
and... look at the water.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.166
Yeah, that'll definitely work.

12:33.649 --> 12:36.859
Oh, look at you, all dolled up
with your big hair.

12:37.377 --> 12:38.930
It's not because there'’s
a new dad

12:38.965 --> 12:40.069
on the scene is it?

12:42.451 --> 12:43.866
What? No.
No, I've got a

12:44.280 --> 12:46.213
work thing tonight -
I'’ve got a book launch.

12:46.248 --> 12:48.008
All right, calm down.

12:49.147 --> 12:50.459
You can give him your CV

12:50.493 --> 12:51.978
when he surfaces, Julia.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.359
- Come on Anne.
- Oh, sorry.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.950
No phones in the pool!

13:00.227 --> 13:02.609
Hang on, I'm just gonna get
this bloke to mind my phone.

13:10.065 --> 13:11.514
Can you look after my phone?

13:11.549 --> 13:12.550
No, absolutely not.

13:13.551 --> 13:14.666
Just for a bit, it'’s just
that I'’m waiting

13:14.690 --> 13:16.865
- for a really important call.
- No, absolutely not.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.106
Oh, come on.

13:19.488 --> 13:21.490
How about if I give you
a tenner?

13:21.939 --> 13:22.939
Ugh...

13:40.302 --> 13:41.441
No bombing!

13:46.273 --> 13:47.585
I thought you
weren't getting in.

13:58.354 --> 13:59.355
Liz!

14:00.494 --> 14:03.118
Please don't hit daddy
in the face with a dolphin.

14:03.152 --> 14:04.222
Liz!

14:05.258 --> 14:06.880
Say, "The Coach and Horses."

14:08.226 --> 14:10.056
Say, "they do craft ales."

14:10.677 --> 14:14.198
Do a dot dot dot then,
"Could be fun" question mark.

14:21.619 --> 14:24.001
I could hold my breath
for that long.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.866
I have done many a time,
when I get the hiccups.

14:27.556 --> 14:29.627
Which is every time
I drink a cider.

14:58.794 --> 15:00.416
Uh, ah!

15:11.324 --> 15:13.602
I don't like this Liz,
I don't like this at all.

15:15.328 --> 15:16.329
Hello, Anne.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.194
Where's Darius, then?

15:20.436 --> 15:22.552
Oh, we decided to keep him
off swimming for the time being.

15:22.576 --> 15:24.682
Yeah. he gets dermatosis
from the floats.

15:24.993 --> 15:26.353
What, you've come here
on your own?

15:26.546 --> 15:27.927
No, no, he'’s up there.

15:29.618 --> 15:32.310
Do you know, I lost a ring
in this pool late last year.

15:32.345 --> 15:34.726
Yeah, I shed of lot of weight
a while back,

15:34.761 --> 15:36.142
because of the IBS.

15:37.384 --> 15:39.704
And I must have lost a pound
off my hands and wrists alone.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.424
Which meant
that my grandmother's ring just

15:42.458 --> 15:44.357
slipped off and got sucked
into a filter.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.498
They actually named me
after her, but um,

15:48.016 --> 15:50.950
she died
when I was about five days old.

15:51.157 --> 15:54.022
So, the only thing I have left
of her now are these earrings

15:54.056 --> 15:55.057
which...

15:57.094 --> 15:58.105
I don'’t wanna make it worse,

15:58.129 --> 15:59.268
but your tit'’s hanging out.

16:04.791 --> 16:05.792
Excuse me, one minute.

16:10.866 --> 16:12.109
Ah!

16:13.179 --> 16:15.139
- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing?

16:15.491 --> 16:17.459
You gave me the fright
of my life!

16:18.253 --> 16:20.462
Did you follow me
into a swimming pool?

16:20.496 --> 16:22.336
Of course I didn't follow you,
I'm not psychotic.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.396
You said you were busy.

16:23.430 --> 16:24.776
This isn't busy,
this is swimming.

16:24.811 --> 16:26.330
- It's exercise!
- No, it's not.

16:26.364 --> 16:29.298
- You're barely moving.
- Oh, it isn't my fault

16:29.712 --> 16:33.268
that you haven't organized
your childcare.

16:33.682 --> 16:36.478
You've got some cheek
swimming up to me to me

16:36.512 --> 16:39.136
and saying that!
I haven't had time, mother!

16:39.446 --> 16:40.768
Because I have been busy
looking after

16:40.792 --> 16:42.242
your grandchildren.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.523
What'’s important now
is that you're here,

16:47.558 --> 16:49.215
so if you wouldn'’t mind
taking over, I...

16:49.249 --> 16:51.665
I'm not taking over,
I'm exercising.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.461
Don't you swim away
from me, mother! Come back here!

16:55.393 --> 16:57.016
Don'’t you swim away from me!

17:02.228 --> 17:03.677
Hey, Kevin! Kevin!

17:04.161 --> 17:05.886
You want to join
in this human wave machine?

17:05.921 --> 17:07.401
I've wrangled some
of the bigger mums.

17:07.888 --> 17:09.131
Don't do it Kevin.

17:10.788 --> 17:11.788
Yeah!

17:12.479 --> 17:13.479
Fine.

17:14.309 --> 17:15.309
Whatever.

17:19.417 --> 17:22.144
- He's such a great guy.
- Kevin?

17:23.214 --> 17:25.216
Don't be ridiculous, James.

17:26.114 --> 17:28.047
I'm his,
"The One That Got Away."

17:28.668 --> 17:30.290
Crazy, I know.

17:30.325 --> 17:31.923
Don'’t tell anyone that,
I turned him down,

17:31.947 --> 17:33.569
years ago,
broke his heart a bit.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.503
And then he got
with his wife, Thandie.

17:37.366 --> 17:40.300
But I think... he still has
a bit of thing for me.

17:47.894 --> 17:49.585
Right.
Okay, everybody listen up.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.553
On the count of three, ready?

17:52.140 --> 17:54.866
One, two, three.

17:55.522 --> 17:59.388
Pull! Pull! Pull!

18:00.458 --> 18:04.669
Pull! Pull! Pull!

18:05.843 --> 18:09.640
Pull! Pull! Pull!

18:11.159 --> 18:13.264
Pull! Kevin?

18:25.966 --> 18:29.177
I'’ve got you man, don't worry,
it's all right. I'’ve got you.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.731
I'’ve got you. There you go.
There you go.

18:32.283 --> 18:33.871
It'’s all right.
You all right, bud?

18:34.527 --> 18:37.323
Yes, I'm all right, bud!
My God.

18:38.427 --> 18:40.533
- Breathe, breathe.
- I didn't need to be saved.

18:41.637 --> 18:44.295
I was out there enjoying
the thrill of the current.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.160
I don't jump in the pool
every time,

18:47.195 --> 18:48.782
every time you go for a swim.

18:50.405 --> 18:52.924
It's okay. All right...
That'’s it, off you go.

19:05.592 --> 19:06.904
Oh, oh... Oh, no.

19:38.315 --> 19:40.282
I'm just worried
that sounded a bit eager.

19:40.834 --> 19:43.975
- When did he last text?
- Four fifteen.

19:44.424 --> 19:46.702
- And when did I text?
- Four sixteen.

19:46.944 --> 19:48.911
- Liz?
- Did it ring? Did my phone...

19:50.361 --> 19:52.743
Oh. It'’s all gone a bit quiet.

19:53.295 --> 19:54.710
I'’m sure it's fine. What's up?

19:55.090 --> 19:57.955
Uh...
I did a bit of a silly thing.

19:58.369 --> 20:00.854
- What?
- I, uh...

20:02.028 --> 20:04.582
I threw James' trousers
out of the window.

20:04.824 --> 20:06.481
Oh. That's normal.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.967
It was spur of the moment
thing, I... I didn't think.

20:10.933 --> 20:13.591
It was red mist, or the...
The heat of the changing room

20:13.626 --> 20:16.456
or, he just, I don't know,
he just wound me up

20:16.491 --> 20:18.631
and, I mean,
I immediately regretted it.

20:18.872 --> 20:19.872
Well, just put them back.

20:19.977 --> 20:21.841
Well I... I tried but...

20:22.497 --> 20:24.499
I mean, I looked outside
but I couldn't see them.

20:25.051 --> 20:26.708
He'll just think someone nicked
them.

20:26.742 --> 20:28.296
You know, things get stolen.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.746
I used to get new trainers
from changing rooms all the time

20:30.781 --> 20:32.748
- when I was a kid.
- Hey, Kev.

20:33.301 --> 20:35.820
Hi, I saw this at the bottom
of the pool.

20:35.855 --> 20:37.695
Dived down and got it.
Think it might be yours.

20:39.341 --> 20:40.756
- Thanks.
- No worries.

20:44.795 --> 20:46.003
Did my phone just ring?

20:56.427 --> 20:58.740
- The hero.
- Well, I dunno.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.501
I think he was a bit upset.

21:01.536 --> 21:04.332
He said um, my watch strap
scratched his neck or something.

21:05.885 --> 21:07.714
It's so great reconnecting
with you.

21:07.749 --> 21:10.476
- Yeah.
- After all these years.

21:11.684 --> 21:14.687
And you and Thandie.
Still together.

21:14.721 --> 21:16.516
- Mm.
- In a way, I feel like

21:16.551 --> 21:18.069
I should take credit for it.

21:18.104 --> 21:20.486
- What? How?
- Because...

21:22.798 --> 21:24.455
of course,
we had our little thing,

21:24.490 --> 21:26.319
when you asked me out
and I said no.

21:26.354 --> 21:28.010
- Huh?
- Just think,

21:28.045 --> 21:29.667
if I hadn't turned you down,

21:30.461 --> 21:32.325
you wouldn'’t have rebounded
with Thandie.

21:32.567 --> 21:36.018
I think it was...
literally the next day.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.469
- What?
- You asked her out the next day

21:38.504 --> 21:40.624
- after I turned you down.
- You didn'’t turn me down.

21:41.990 --> 21:44.475
- Yes, I did.
- I didn't ask you out.

21:46.028 --> 21:47.513
- You did.
- What?

21:51.724 --> 21:55.555
Oh, shit! Yeah.
I did ask you out.

21:55.590 --> 21:56.729
You did.

21:57.419 --> 21:59.139
Yeah, I'’d...
I'd completely forgotten that.

22:11.502 --> 22:14.056
Everyone wearing
a green wristband

22:14.505 --> 22:16.956
please make your way
out of the pool.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.647
Did it ring?

22:18.682 --> 22:19.682
Did my phone just...?

22:24.204 --> 22:25.447
Give it to me!

22:25.999 --> 22:27.932
Hello.

22:28.588 --> 22:31.488
Right, come on, then. Okay.
Let's get that off.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.594
No, no, no, not on the coat,
not on the coat!

22:34.629 --> 22:36.941
Not the coat, not the coat.
Oh, God!

22:36.976 --> 22:39.081
Okay, okay!

22:39.737 --> 22:41.877
He called, Kevin.
Wallet man called,

22:41.912 --> 22:43.707
- and I have to go now.
- Okay, have fun.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.743
Not now, Kevin!
I have to go now.

22:45.778 --> 22:46.951
You have to take my kids.

22:46.986 --> 22:48.608
I'm already taking Julia's kids.

22:48.643 --> 22:50.438
You have to take my kids, Kevin.
Please!

22:50.645 --> 22:52.371
Please Kevin,
take my fucking kids.

22:52.888 --> 22:53.889
Fine!

23:09.560 --> 23:11.079
That's how to look, darling.

23:24.299 --> 23:25.749
Hey. Kev mate.

23:27.026 --> 23:28.510
Sorry about the wave
machine thing.

23:28.717 --> 23:30.167
I... shouldn't have made you
do it.

23:31.824 --> 23:33.239
Sorry I shouted at you.

23:34.102 --> 23:36.415
And... and thanks
for getting me out.

23:37.485 --> 23:38.772
- It's all right.
- It's just usually

23:38.796 --> 23:41.212
I'm the first aider... you know?
Because I'’m fully qualified

23:41.247 --> 23:42.628
with St. John's ambulance.

23:43.698 --> 23:44.698
But sorry.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.079
Seriously, it's fine.

23:46.770 --> 23:48.772
I get a bit overexcited,
sometimes.

23:49.566 --> 23:51.222
Just getting to spend time
with my kids.

23:52.845 --> 23:56.227
Until this week, they barely
noticed if I was home, you know,

23:56.952 --> 23:59.161
they don't rely on me,
because they're so used to

23:59.196 --> 24:00.887
not having me around.

24:01.647 --> 24:02.751
Well, that's...

24:04.788 --> 24:06.445
I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:07.618 --> 24:08.930
But it... it... can be lonely

24:08.964 --> 24:10.518
being a full-time dad,
too, though.

24:10.552 --> 24:11.712
- You know.
- Yeah, but you've

24:12.727 --> 24:14.498
got to think about all
the good things about it.

24:14.522 --> 24:16.040
Your kids adore you.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.561
I can see that. I... I'd kill
to have that kind of bond.

24:20.044 --> 24:23.703
You're probably the first parent
they call for in the night

24:23.738 --> 24:25.338
- when they've had a bad dream.
- Always.

24:29.537 --> 24:30.537
I knew it.

24:31.539 --> 24:32.712
You're, uh...

24:35.750 --> 24:36.750
Wait a second.

24:38.753 --> 24:39.788
Wait a minute...

24:41.065 --> 24:42.757
- where's my trousers?
- Hmm?

24:43.102 --> 24:46.174
My trousers.
My trousers aren't here.

24:46.588 --> 24:48.228
- Trousers?
- They're definitely not here.

24:48.556 --> 24:51.317
Trousers. Trousers. What...
What did they look like?

24:51.766 --> 24:53.146
Trousers.
They look like trousers.

24:53.181 --> 24:54.181
Here, uh...

24:55.355 --> 24:57.081
Take mine.
We're almost the same height.

24:57.116 --> 24:58.600
- What?
- Honestly, take them.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.946
-What'll you wear?

24:59.981 --> 25:01.879
- I'll wear the towel home.
- Why?

25:01.914 --> 25:03.191
You'd do the same for me.

25:03.225 --> 25:04.785
- I wouldn't.
- Take my trousers, James.

25:04.813 --> 25:07.229
- No I...
- Take my bloody trousers, James!

25:19.241 --> 25:21.002
Mommy! Mommy, look.

25:23.694 --> 25:25.731
- Liz?
- Russell?

25:25.938 --> 25:29.942
It'’s Mitch. My surnames
Mitchum, so Mitch.

25:30.183 --> 25:32.841
Oh, well. Here's your wallet,
Mitch Mitchum.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.673
It'’s got your three cards
and your ten pounds.

25:36.707 --> 25:38.329
Count it. It's all there.

25:38.364 --> 25:41.781
And, uh, I sorted your receipts
and did your tax returns.

25:44.266 --> 25:45.923
Not really, no, I haven'’t.

25:47.822 --> 25:50.756
Do you have to wear
that for... scaffolding?

25:51.239 --> 25:54.069
No, um... I rode over here.

25:54.414 --> 25:57.072
- Oh, what, you got a motorbike?
- Yeah. You wanna see it?

25:57.728 --> 26:00.386
What? You don'’t wanna go in
for a... a... a drink or...

26:00.938 --> 26:02.388
No, no, no, let'’s see the bike.

26:11.052 --> 26:12.640
Shall I rev it up?

26:13.675 --> 26:15.712
Oh, yeah.

26:15.988 --> 26:17.334
Yeah, very good.

26:25.135 --> 26:26.135
Very good.

26:29.898 --> 26:32.729
Do you wanna...
Do you wanna go in for a drink?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.156
Oh, for fuck's sake!

26:50.022 --> 26:51.920
Can I have a...

26:52.818 --> 26:54.854
Can I have a bit of hush please?

26:56.373 --> 26:59.721
It is a huge honor tonight
that we have in our midst

26:59.963 --> 27:02.448
uh... one of my...

27:03.691 --> 27:05.244
personal heroes.

27:06.832 --> 27:09.662
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I introduce to you,

27:10.214 --> 27:11.319
Malcolm Spender.

27:15.979 --> 27:16.979
Thank you, Julia.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.880
Uh, the cover of my book
is a photo

27:20.915 --> 27:22.848
of our hotel
just after it was destroyed.

27:23.711 --> 27:25.989
The surrounding area
was completely devastated.

27:26.506 --> 27:28.716
People wandering blindly,

27:29.371 --> 27:31.926
human beings at their most
miserable, and vulnerable.

27:33.099 --> 27:35.861
I can'’t begin to describe
the squalor

27:35.895 --> 27:38.346
and degradation we witnessed
over the next few hours.

27:38.864 --> 27:41.798
It was the closest thing
I'’d ever seen to hell on earth.

27:42.143 --> 27:43.834
Oh, give me a break.
