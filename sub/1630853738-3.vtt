10:06.518 --> 10:09.391
And, second,

10:09.434 --> 10:11.045
don't you want answers?

10:11.088 --> 10:13.264
Or, at the very least,
to get justice for Chuck?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.744
You just want to get the
Banner so your friend Violet

10:14.788 --> 10:16.050
doesn't get killed

10:16.093 --> 10:17.312
trying to win
the bounty, right?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.661
I mean...

10:18.705 --> 10:20.054
there's also that.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.664
Okay.Like I said,

10:21.708 --> 10:23.666
so many reasons.Okay.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.146
Vince.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.930
Yes.That cell phone
we got off the guy

10:26.974 --> 10:29.367
from the Jade Viper,
anything useful on it?

10:29.411 --> 10:30.891
Yeah.
[clears throat]All the calls

10:30.934 --> 10:33.154
were to black market
antiquities dealers

10:33.197 --> 10:35.373
that were connected to the
Khan's search for the Banner.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.071
Hahn, I've got this.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.551
Okay, none of them
had any knowledge

10:39.595 --> 10:41.684
of where the Banner is,
though there's one--

10:41.728 --> 10:43.077
who it appears,
from phone records,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.992
our terrorist friend
called several times--

10:45.035 --> 10:46.646
that's been hard to pin down.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.821
Graham Townsend.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.474
It appears to be an alias.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.302
VINCE:
Graham Townsend.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.088
It appears to be an alias.LEXI:
"Hard to pin down"

10:54.131 --> 10:55.785
is exactly how I'd describe him.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.048
Graham Townsend's been
in Portlaoise Supermax Prison

10:58.092 --> 10:59.267
in Ireland the past few months.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.225
I'll put in
some calls,

11:01.269 --> 11:02.618
see if we can get in
to see him.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.055
He's bound to give
us more than Kate.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.405
Yeah, the real problem
will be getting him to shut up.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.451
Who the hell is Graham Townsend?

11:09.494 --> 11:13.542
You're probably more familiar
with his other alias:

11:13.585 --> 11:15.762
Simon Hardwick.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.203
DANNY:
If she doesn't give up
anything about why

11:22.246 --> 11:24.074
the CIA wants the Banner or
what they know about the Khan

11:24.118 --> 11:25.728
by the time we're back,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.730
we're turning her over
to the Vietnamese.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.080
See, I-I'm trying to go clean,
and now you got me involved

11:30.124 --> 11:32.300
in kidnapping
and false imprisonment.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.694
Yeah, I'm not a big fan
of this, either.LEXI: Chuck.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.609
She knows something
about who killed your friends,

11:37.653 --> 11:39.742
about who put you
in the hospital.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.657
Don't you want answers?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.269
[Lexi sighs]

11:45.313 --> 11:49.578
Do you work for the Vatican
or the Vatican't?

11:51.580 --> 11:53.364
Please don't ever
say that again.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.671
Chuck, as long
as I have known you,

11:55.715 --> 11:57.847
there is something
you have always been good at:

11:57.891 --> 11:59.762
getting people to open up.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.809
[pats shoulder]You got this.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.771
Yeah.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.555
You got this.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.920
[door clangs open]

12:33.535 --> 12:35.406
[quietly]:
He looks friendly.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.590
[clears throat]

12:49.246 --> 12:50.639
No way.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.946
This is an
unexpected pleasure.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.730
Wonderful to see
old friends again.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.905
Simon.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.951
We're not friends.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.648
Well, not in the way
you could admit publicly.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.041
Uh, not in any way.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.564
There was a connection,
wasn't there?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.566
We're here to ask you
about discussions you've had

13:04.609 --> 13:06.611
with a Vietnamese
antiquities buyer,

13:06.655 --> 13:10.093
about a Mongolian artifact
called a Spirit Banner.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.705
The Soul of Genghis Khan,
isn't it?

13:14.706 --> 13:16.099
Wait a minute.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.666
Is this new business?

13:17.709 --> 13:20.930
[chuckles]:
It's new business.

13:20.974 --> 13:24.499
You two are you on another hunt.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.675
And, uh...

13:26.718 --> 13:28.720
you're still together.Yes.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.157
What's that supposed to mean?Well, it doesn't mean
anything at all.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.463
I'm just, you know, I assumed...

13:32.507 --> 13:34.204
I'm a bit surprised, is all.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.077
I-I would've thought that,
after the initial adrenaline

13:37.120 --> 13:40.384
of catching me wore off,
you know, that you two

13:40.428 --> 13:42.125
would have,
uh, you know.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.823
But you found another shot
of adrenaline, so well done.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.998
Well, it turns out,
we're not just

13:45.041 --> 13:46.477
a "shot of adrenaline."

13:46.521 --> 13:48.915
Listen, no offense.
S-Sincerely, I've...

13:48.958 --> 13:51.569
I never set much stock
in human connections.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.615
But the fact is, I never
really had the chance to.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.791
Okay, we're not
taking relationship advice

13:55.835 --> 13:57.184
from a psychopath.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.142
He's Lectering us.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.144
It's pronounced "lecture,"
darling.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.276
No. Hannibal Lecter?

14:02.319 --> 14:05.018
He's getting
inside our heads.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.671
The Silence of the Lambs.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.238
We just watched this movie
a month ago.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.066
Is it one of those boring,
artsy movies?

14:10.110 --> 14:11.938
Simon, there's someone
calling himself

14:11.981 --> 14:15.202
the Great Khan who wants
the Soul of Genghis Khan.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.943
I never really understood
its mystique,

14:16.986 --> 14:19.902
to be quite honest, which made
it all the more fascinating.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.513
Coupled with the fact that it's
an object of the utmost desire

14:22.557 --> 14:24.907
for some of the worst monsters
in history.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.735
Do you know where it is now?

14:26.778 --> 14:29.738
Well, I did do some searching
on behalf of a rather...

14:29.781 --> 14:32.393
well-heeled former client.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.525
And I was on the trail,

14:34.569 --> 14:36.397
but out of the blue
he called it off.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.226
Well, can you point us
in the right direction?

14:39.269 --> 14:40.967
Yeah, I could.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.143
But there would need to be
some form of a quid pro quo.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.058
[sighs]

14:45.101 --> 14:47.147
[tongue clicks]

14:47.190 --> 14:49.801
Seriously?
You don't remember this movie?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.325
I get sleepy.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.327
[quietly]:
Wow.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.677
I can find you the Banner.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.287
You just need to break me
out of prison first.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.420
Okay, we're out of here.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.552
How's your Russian?

15:02.727 --> 15:05.121
The Antiquariat.
Ever heard of it?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.559
The Antiquariat.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.086
When Joseph Stalin took power,
he created the Antiquariat

15:13.129 --> 15:15.871
to loot valuable artifacts
for the Soviet state.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.960
But most of what they
stole disappeared.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.309
Yes, but I happen

15:19.353 --> 15:22.225
to know where
the antiquities ended up.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.227
And with whom.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.794
And whom do we talk to?I don't suppose

15:25.837 --> 15:27.622
I could get a gin and tonic,
could I?

15:27.665 --> 15:29.232
If your tip pays off,
I'll get you all the booze

15:29.276 --> 15:30.494
you bloody want.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.804
Andrei Levchenko.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.763
Former member
of the Night Devils.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.462
It's like a Russian version
of the Hells Angels.

15:41.505 --> 15:44.291
He's a rather rough
sort. But then

15:44.334 --> 15:46.162
l'amour.
[chuckles] L'amour.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.165
Went to France and fell in love.
He's a totally changed man now.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.950
Runs a restaurant.
Michelin. Two stars.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.777
Just off Red Square. Claudine's.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.955
Named
for his lovely French wife.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.913
It's quite a romantic story

15:57.957 --> 16:00.698
if you can ignore
all the people he's murdered.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.657
So,

16:02.700 --> 16:04.354
all you've got to do
is drop my name,

16:04.398 --> 16:06.878
and he'll be only too pleased
to help.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.325
I'm gonna text
Shaw and Chuck.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.502
Uh,

16:21.545 --> 16:23.765
this is a great time
to remind you

16:23.808 --> 16:25.288
I am a wanted felon in Russia.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.073
Huh?It's an occupationalhazard.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.465
Just make sure
we don't get caught.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.076
NEWSMAN:
...the West African nation.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.078
And now the latest
on the attack in Russia.

16:32.121 --> 16:35.168
Amateur footage
was leaked online today.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.778
Russian authorities
have given no comment,

16:36.821 --> 16:38.127
as speculation persists

16:38.171 --> 16:40.042
about what the attackers
might have taken

16:40.086 --> 16:41.478
from the base near Saratov.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.785
Fantastic. Now the Khan
might have nukes.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.787
...of nuclear weapons that were
known to be stored there.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.441
The attack was carried out

16:47.484 --> 16:48.790
by the mysterious group
known only by this...

16:48.833 --> 16:50.574
That's gonna make it

16:50.618 --> 16:53.055
a lot harder to
get into Russia.I love a good challenge.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.231
Let me check out some options.NEWSMAN: All major Russian
news agencies are reporting...

16:55.275 --> 16:58.017
[music playing faintly]

17:00.323 --> 17:03.283
Hey. CIA lady still here?Yep.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.720
She tried to escape
three times.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.156
I just nailed the windows shut.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.420
What'd you find?Her CIA team

17:10.464 --> 17:12.292
got away and fled
the country.

17:12.335 --> 17:15.643
If the CIA's hiding some
connection to the Khan,

17:15.686 --> 17:17.558
we're not gonna find it.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.081
What about from another angle?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.561
The gangs the Khan's
been working with.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.476
Maybe they know something.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.435
Most of the criminal informants
I worked with when I was a cop

17:25.479 --> 17:27.872
and when the Khan was
coming up are now in prison.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.179
[exhales]

17:30.223 --> 17:31.659
Hold on.

17:31.702 --> 17:35.184
I... I'll be right back.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.969
I-I know what
the CIA's been hiding.Really?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.189
When I was running guns
in South America,

17:40.233 --> 17:43.366
one day all my competition
started to disappear.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.673
It turns out someone made
a deal with the local cops

17:45.716 --> 17:47.936
to give them up.Was that someone you?

17:47.979 --> 17:49.851
It... The point is,

17:49.894 --> 17:52.854
the Great Khan didn't
rise on his own.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.334
He had help.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.597
Someone slipping intel
to local law enforcement

17:56.640 --> 17:57.946
all over the region,

17:57.989 --> 17:59.339
knocking out
the competition,

17:59.382 --> 18:01.689
consolidating the power.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.040
The CIA was working
with the Khan,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.737
weren't they?

18:06.781 --> 18:10.001
You sure this is a road
you really want to go down,

18:10.045 --> 18:11.525
Dwayne?

18:11.568 --> 18:15.659
Son of Marcus
and Charlotte Coleman.

18:15.703 --> 18:19.141
Marcus was a Marine colonel.
Charlotte was a social worker.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.883
Both highly respected members
of the community

18:21.926 --> 18:24.146
who raised
an impressive family.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.800
With one exception.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.063
Watch it.Kicked out of two
military prep schools.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.934
Washed out of the service.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.676
You've been a screwup
since day one.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.896
Kate, come on.What happened, Dwayne?

18:34.939 --> 18:36.202
You just couldn't cut it?

18:36.245 --> 18:38.856
Or is it you only ever cared
about money?

18:38.900 --> 18:42.121
Do they even know
their son is still alive,

18:42.164 --> 18:45.515
living under a dead man's name
to avoid prison?

18:45.559 --> 18:48.344
A son without a country,

18:48.388 --> 18:52.043
without family,
without friends.That's enough.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.493
Try and escape again,

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
see what happens.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.464
Not cool.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.510
Kate I used to know

19:23.553 --> 19:24.815
never would've done
something like that.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.296
The Kate you used to know

19:27.340 --> 19:29.472
thought her father
was a good man.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.953
Her dream job
was to run a nonprofit

19:31.996 --> 19:33.911
to make the world
a better place.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.262
She thought
she understood the world.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.220
She was an idiot.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.830
So you're gonna make the world
a better place

19:39.874 --> 19:42.050
by lying
and manipulating your friends?I'm trying

19:42.093 --> 19:43.486
to catch a terrorist.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.401
I do not have time
to explain myself to you.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.144
Well...
[chuckles]

19:49.188 --> 19:53.888
"With the Lord, a day is
like a thousand years,

19:53.931 --> 19:56.543
and a thousand years
are like a day."

19:56.586 --> 19:59.763
In other words, Kate,

19:59.807 --> 20:02.418
we got nothing but time.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.684
LEXI:
Okay, so I've got
this one last contact

20:07.728 --> 20:09.295
who can help smuggle us
into Moscow.

33:41.236 --> 33:44.152
These records go back all
the way to before World War II.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.632
LEVCHENKO:
This line says what went where.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.764
Here is who paid and how much.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.985
And this is the Soviet official
who signed off.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.684
Okay.Here is the entry for
the Soul of Genghis Khan.

33:54.728 --> 33:57.078
This one just has initials.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.472
The only man in the Soviet Union

33:59.515 --> 34:01.865
who needn't bother
with a signature.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.565
Joseph Stalin.

34:06.566 --> 34:10.352
Okay, all of the ones
requested by Stalin

34:10.396 --> 34:12.137
were sent to...

34:12.180 --> 34:14.182
Ministry of
Social Sciences.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.010
My grandfather told me

34:16.054 --> 34:18.360
that Stalin would appropriate
the strangest antiquities

34:18.404 --> 34:20.884
and send them somewhere
far away to be studied.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.063
[exhales]You know
where the Banner went.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.587
Have you ever heard
of the forbidden zone?

34:27.630 --> 34:30.068
No. But suddenly
I want to go there.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.547
It's a remote region in Mongolia

34:31.591 --> 34:34.420
rumored to be the burial place
of Genghis Khan.

34:34.463 --> 34:38.206
Hmm.The Russians cordoned
off the whole area.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.730
Okay. So what's there?

34:40.774 --> 34:42.558
An old, secret
Red Army base.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.908
Like America's Area 51.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.911
Many rumors about the type of
things that happened there.

34:47.955 --> 34:50.000
Highly classified.

34:50.044 --> 34:52.438
DANNY:The forbidden zone's a couple
hundred square kilometers.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.701
Simon's got to know more
than he's letting on.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.659
Yeah. Of course he does.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.444
And he'd probably send us
into another trap.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.315
No, we don't need him.

35:00.359 --> 35:02.100
LEVCHENKO:I agree.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.493
Luckily, my grandfather showed
me the way when I was a boy.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.239
It started when the CIA
wanted to recruit assets

35:11.283 --> 35:13.502
to give us eyes and ears
inside of criminal syndicates.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.678
Since when does the CIA
care about criminals?

35:15.722 --> 35:17.985
Since criminals started
working with terrorists.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.291
Now,

35:19.334 --> 35:20.814
cartels and mobsters
and gangsters

35:20.857 --> 35:22.163
tend to hate each other.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.469
They're all competing
for the same pie,

35:23.512 --> 35:24.992
and it's a zero-sum game.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.342
But one person
started to change that.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.083
He somehow gained
everybody's respect,

35:29.127 --> 35:31.172
which made him an amazing asset.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.654
The Great Khan.He didn't always call
himself that, but yeah.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.395
Only his handler
knew his real identity,

35:36.438 --> 35:38.179
but it was all working.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.008
Using the Khan's intel,
we took down a lot of bad guys.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.402
But the Khan
was playing a long game.

35:43.445 --> 35:46.231
He was taking out
the competition.

35:46.274 --> 35:49.756
Shaw was right.That was just the start.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.279
He turned his CIA handler,

35:51.323 --> 35:53.325
and we didn't find out
until it was too late.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.805
Most of our knowledge on
the Khan's organization,

35:55.849 --> 35:58.286
including our files on the
Khan himself, went missing,

35:58.330 --> 36:00.549
along with his handler,
who we assume is dead.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.508
But the Khan also got

36:02.551 --> 36:04.292
access to old CIA files.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.425
Uh, files of what?We don't know,
but after that,

36:06.468 --> 36:07.817
we started getting reports
that he was looking

36:07.861 --> 36:08.992
for the Spirit Banner.

36:09.036 --> 36:11.038
It's possible

36:11.081 --> 36:12.692
the CIA is compromised.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.347
My team thought we were safer
if we worked on our own.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.262
We thought
if we could get the Banner,

36:17.305 --> 36:21.048
then we could draw the Khan out
a-and capture him or kill him.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.529
But wh-why does he want
the Banner?Genghis Khan

36:23.572 --> 36:25.835
is still a big deal in much
of this part of the world.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.185
Maybe he thinks it will bestow

36:27.228 --> 36:29.099
some kind of special power
over him,

36:29.143 --> 36:31.450
or maybe he just knows
it means something

36:31.493 --> 36:33.582
to the people
he's recruiting.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.454
But knowing everything he's done
without it,

36:35.497 --> 36:38.239
I can't imagine
he gets less scary with it.

37:00.261 --> 37:03.264

important question

37:03.308 --> 37:05.440
than why he wants
the Banner.

37:05.484 --> 37:08.226
Why was his first big move
to attack the Vatican?

37:08.269 --> 37:10.402
What did he get
from the Giftschrank?

Well, if they know,
they're not telling me.

37:13.579 --> 37:17.452

a lot of effort to get it.
