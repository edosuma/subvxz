WEBVTT

01:27.505 --> 01:28.506
There she is!

01:31.300 --> 01:32.510
Gloria!

01:32.593 --> 01:33.969
Hi.

01:34.053 --> 01:35.054
Welcome!

01:35.137 --> 01:36.806
-You look great.
-Thank you!

01:36.889 --> 01:39.183
-Darcy, where have you been?
-Hey! Hi!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.811
I was just taking a minute.
Is that allowed?

01:41.894 --> 01:43.270
Not at your wedding.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.856
-Your Ketel One martini.
-Oh.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.566
Obrigada,  Jerome.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.569
Where is the groomzilla?

01:50.653 --> 01:52.571
Tom is not a groomzilla, okay?

01:52.655 --> 01:56.325
He just committed to making
every detail perfect.

01:56.408 --> 01:59.453
You should have taken your father's money
for this wedding.

01:59.537 --> 02:02.957
Then, professionals would make
everything  perfecto  for you.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.750
Mom, I've told you. We are adults

02:04.834 --> 02:08.671
and we wanted to pay for our own wedding
so it could be what we wanted.

02:08.754 --> 02:11.257
And this is what you wanted?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.050
That was a printing error.

02:15.928 --> 02:21.851

Anyone that you adore ♪

02:21.934 --> 02:28.482

02:48.794 --> 02:49.837
Oh! Oh!

02:53.215 --> 02:55.050
Oh! Hey!

02:55.134 --> 02:57.177
Oh, I almost shoot you!

02:57.261 --> 02:59.346
I thought you're a pirate
but you're just a guy.

03:02.016 --> 03:05.352
Ah, this is for your bride, huh?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.355
Yeah, trying to surprise her.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.858
I saw something just like it on Etsy,

03:10.941 --> 03:14.361
and it looked perfect,
but now I'm not so sure.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.157
Now, I wanna be romantic
but not too corny.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.075
There's a really fine line
between the two.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.495
Aren't you supposed to be over there?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.749
Your rehearsal party.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.917
Oh, my God!

03:28.292 --> 03:31.545
I need you to talk
to your father's yoga teacher.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.589
-Girlfriend?
-Yeah, whatever.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.549
She keeps smiling at me.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.594
Can you tell her to stop smiling at me?

03:38.677 --> 03:39.678
Yes, Mom.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.139
I will tell Dad's girlfriend
to stop smiling at you.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.682
That won't cause any issues.

03:43.766 --> 03:46.560
Also, I cannot sit at a table
with Tom's mother.

03:46.644 --> 03:51.231
On the boat here, she tried to start
a sing-along to  South Pacific.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.108
She's excited. Okay?

03:53.192 --> 03:55.194
She's never been out
of the country before.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.946
What kind of a grown woman
has never left the country?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.781
Please, Mom, for two days,
can you just get along with...

03:58.864 --> 04:00.199
Carol!

04:00.282 --> 04:02.993
♪  I'm gonna wash that man
Right outta my hair ♪

04:03.077 --> 04:06.455

04:06.538 --> 04:09.333
♪  And send him on his way ♪

04:12.252 --> 04:13.587
I've been looking forward to this moment

04:13.671 --> 04:16.131
ever since baby Tommy
was cut out of my abdomen.

04:16.215 --> 04:17.800
-Oh, my God,

04:17.883 --> 04:19.969
I have never been
on a private island before.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.680
I've never been even on an island before.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.056
Actually, you know what? That's not true.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.433
I went with the Heibermans.
We went to Mackinac, you know,

04:26.517 --> 04:28.185
before they moved to Bloomington.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.771
Have you ever been to Mackinac, Renata?

04:30.854 --> 04:33.899
I don't know what that is
or most of the words you just said.

04:33.983 --> 04:35.985
Wouldn't she just love it, Larry?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.403
Oh. Hi, Darcy.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.487
Hey, Larry.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.197
I didn't see you there.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.782
-Hi.
-Hi, Renata.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.367
Guess what? We got you a gift.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.160
-Oh, you didn't have to.
-Yes, we did.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.954
It's the biggest day
of our lives tomorrow.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.038
What are you talking about?

04:48.122 --> 04:50.374
-Come on, open it.
-Okay.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.836
-Larry, she's opening.
-I get... Oh.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.170
Ah-uh-huh.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.297
Oh. Someone just left that
in the bathroom.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.969
Oh, you're a lifesaver, Margy.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.429
I cannot believe I'm late for this.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.805
The guests are already mingling,

05:04.888 --> 05:07.933
and your Darcy is talking
to both the mothers.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.479
Oh, no. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.107
Oh!

05:15.816 --> 05:18.360
You got my daughter rusty knives?

05:18.444 --> 05:20.571
It's your "something borrowed."

05:20.654 --> 05:23.115
Everyone in our family uses
them on their wedding day.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.409
Brings you a lifetime of good luck.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.618
Except for Uncle Greg

05:26.702 --> 05:29.413
who ended up getting
decapitated on that forklift.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.248
But that's not the knife's fault.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.583
Darcy!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.084
Dad!

05:36.587 --> 05:38.213
-Gracias.
-Mm.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.424
-Carol, you look lovely.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.426
Mm. Mm.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.219
Larry, hello, sir.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.512
-Hey!
-I'm gonna kiss you too.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.097
-Oh.
-Mm.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.099
-Sorry. Done?
-Yeah, okay.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.186
Renata.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.021
Roberto.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.858
I love that you two are still friends.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.735
-Peekaboo!
-Oh.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.111
Hi!

06:01.195 --> 06:03.072
Mwah. Mwah.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.240
Mm!

06:05.699 --> 06:09.536
Oh, Darcy, I am so honored to bear witness

06:09.620 --> 06:12.915
to this sacred observance
of rebirth and devotion.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.627
-Same.
-Thank you.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.713
Renata.

06:23.509 --> 06:26.095
I need to go to the ladies' room.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.596
Hey, me too.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.724
When I'm in formal wear,
I like to pee standing up. How about you?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.019
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.270
Thank you, Margy.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.024
Oh, hey.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.529
-Hey.
-How are you?

06:46.115 --> 06:47.783
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.034
-That's for you.
-Thanks.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.452
Big  papi.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.454
-My man. Mwah.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.957
-This... I just...
-Nice to see you, Dad.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.126
-Señor.
-Let's just, uh, stick

06:57.209 --> 06:58.544
-with "Robert" for a little while.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.962
-Right. Robert.
-Tom, I heard

07:00.045 --> 07:02.131
you were the one who found
this incredible resort.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.091
-Yeah. I did.
-Yes.

07:04.174 --> 07:07.427
I actually study bioresonance,
and this place is

07:07.511 --> 07:09.012
teeming with energetic vibrations.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.014
-Mm.
-It's just like

07:11.098 --> 07:12.975
-our room teeming with bugs.

07:13.058 --> 07:17.354
The, uh, Four Seasons would've been nice,
but you didn't want my help, so...

07:17.437 --> 07:18.438
Some things are more important

07:18.522 --> 07:19.565
-than money, Dad.
-Yeah.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.233
That's debatable.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.068
Well, I need another drink.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.361
-Yeah.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.155
No, I'm good.  Gracias.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.489
Okay, well...

07:28.323 --> 07:29.366
I'm fine.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.911
Is he ever gonna like me?

07:32.995 --> 07:36.123
Yes, if you just chill out
and start acting like yourself.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.126
God, our families are a lot.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.545
-What do you mean?
-And where have you been?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.130
I was just finishing up a little project.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.214
What'd I miss?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.675
Oh, well, your mom gave me cursed knives.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.303
And then my mom almost yelled
at my dad's girlfriend for smiling.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.637
-Oh.
-Oh, also,

07:50.721 --> 07:53.557
your cousin, Amy, asked where
she could charge her vibrator.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.559
Oh, so, Cousin Amy came?

07:55.642 --> 07:56.894
She will soon.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.104
-Um, what are you wearing?

07:59.188 --> 08:00.272
Oh, it's, uh...

08:00.355 --> 08:01.607
Why is your hair all wet?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.108
Oh, I... I just... I...

08:03.192 --> 08:05.527
You know, I went
for a little moonlight swim.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.237
You fell in the water, didn't you?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.198
Yeah, I fell in the water.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.785
You know, it's kinda cute
how bad you are at lying.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.251
Just... Just promise me...

08:22.377 --> 08:25.255
Promise me, you won't let go of my hand
for the rest of the night, okay?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.465
I promise.

08:28.759 --> 08:29.843
Ace.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.055
Ace just put on the honeymoon playlist.
I need to change it.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.182
Well, is "need" the right word?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.725
-Dad, please.
-Oh, yeah.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.854
Tommy, Tommy, I need you
for, like, five minutes.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.105
-What? No, no, no, no.
-It's an emergency.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.607
I've been working
on my best-man speech, right,

08:43.690 --> 08:45.108
and it is going really well.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.527
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.325
Dad's girlfriend just asked me
what my love language is.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.452
She sucks.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.621
Happiest I've seen you in 20 years.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.789
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.095
Dad invited your ex?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.520
God! How does he just keep getting hotter?

09:21.603 --> 09:24.106
Looks like he's leading a porn safari.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.066
I didn't wanna invite him,

09:26.149 --> 09:29.778
but Dad insisted because
he said Bali was so close.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.321
Wow. Wow, wow, wow. wow, wow.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.532
Dad is a messy bitch who loves the drama.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.868
Well, he never RSVP'd,
so we thought we were in the clear.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.207
I didn't think he'd actually come.
You know, he never RSVP'd.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.961
No, that's a very, very cool move.
I'm really excited to meet him.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.547
Oops, looks like he was in a rush

09:48.630 --> 09:50.340
and forgot to button
his shirt all the way up.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.508
Deedee.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.759
-Hey, man, how are you?
-Hey.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.636
Hi, Sean!

09:54.720 --> 09:57.723
I am so sorry that I'm late.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.558
Your dad needed me to go to Japan
at the last minute,

09:59.641 --> 10:01.685
and then, you know,
I had to charter a jet from Kyoto,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.770
-just like a whole thing.
-No, it's okay. We just...

10:03.854 --> 10:05.272
You know, we didn't know you were coming.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.566
Your dad and I
wanted to surprise you.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.526
Look, babe, you know I wasn't
gonna miss your wedding

10:09.609 --> 10:12.070
for anything in this world, right?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.947
-Sean, I want you to meet Tom.
-Tom.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.699
-Oh, hey!
-Tom!

10:15.782 --> 10:17.659
-Tom, Tom, Tom.
-Sean. Yeah.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.785
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, Tom.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.039
Man, I have been dying
to meet Deedee's ball player, man.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.332
What position you play?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.167
-I'm a... Well, I...
-He's a designated hitter.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.586
Uh, unfortunately,
they didn't pick up his contract,

10:27.669 --> 10:29.546
so, technically, he's unemployed, but...

10:30.255 --> 10:31.923
Cut from the minors at 40.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.718
That's a tough break, Tom.
But if you stay positive,

10:34.801 --> 10:37.012
you could have
a really great future in coaching.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.055
You know what I mean?

10:39.598 --> 10:40.599
Yeah.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.642
That is an excellent idea.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.852
-I think so.
-Thank you.

10:43.935 --> 10:44.936
Yeah.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.066
Is it time for dinner?

10:50.442 --> 10:53.487
We are so very touched
that you all made the trek out here.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.657
You know, we really wanted to pick a place
that was convenient for none of you.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.911
You know what,
I talk too much at the law firm.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.998
So I am going to hand it over
to the man of the hour,

11:05.082 --> 11:07.417
the guy who made
this whole weekend happen,

11:08.126 --> 11:09.628
my lovely Tom.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.300
Thank you.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.302
-Do it!
-You go, girl!

11:17.386 --> 11:18.387
Uh...

11:18.470 --> 11:20.055
-Yeah!
-You got this.

11:20.931 --> 11:21.932
-Right?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.016
I can just wing this, right?

11:23.100 --> 11:26.853
Darcy talked a lot about, uh,
her time in the Peace Corps in Bali,

11:26.937 --> 11:28.480
and I thought, you know,

11:28.563 --> 11:30.107
how cool would it be
if we got married there.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.319
And then, I realized that
Bali was un-Bali-vably expensive.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.365
I think the Philippines are better.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.699
-Right, Ace?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.369
Ace agrees. Next.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.247
-Aw!

11:45.330 --> 11:47.541
I know a lot of you were there
to witness my proposal.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.835
The shock and surprise. Priceless.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.963
Anyway, Mom and Dad,
I just wanna say thank you.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.632
Your commitment is something
that we can only aspire to.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.843
-Oh, my God.
-Robert, Renata,

11:58.844 --> 12:01.763
we hope our marriage is
nothing like yours.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.642
Pivot, baby. Pivot.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.104
I mean, that's not a...
a character judgment, by any means.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.898
I mean, 50% of marriages
end in divorce, right?

12:11.982 --> 12:13.442
-Ha! Wonderful.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.901
Cheers, everybody.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.361
-Cheers, cheers, cheers.
-Cheers.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.365
Oh, my God. That did not go well.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.159
No, that was awesome.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.831
So Deedee and I met
in the Peace Corps in Bali.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.585
And one day, we had to run
these medical supplies to this village.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.379
I decided to teach her
how to drive the boat,

12:34.463 --> 12:36.214
so I could sleep
and she could do all the work.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.386
The first time our girl
gets behind the wheel,

12:41.470 --> 12:44.431
she gets a damn speeding ticket
from the coast guard.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.268
Right? Deedee doesn't do
anything half-assed.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.061
She sees what she wants,

12:50.896 --> 12:53.482
she goes after it,
and she doesn't settle for less.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.566
It's true, it's true.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.109
So, as some of you may know,

12:56.193 --> 12:59.488
Deedee and I were,
100 years ago, were engaged.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.781
But she called it off.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.577
No. No, no, no, no.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.162
She was waiting for Tom.

13:08.205 --> 13:12.792
And that guy right there
has gotta be a one-in-a-million supernova

13:12.876 --> 13:14.628
to snag that beautiful soul.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.129
-Thanks.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.924
-Thanks, Sean.
-So, in conclusion,

13:19.007 --> 13:20.926
I just wanna say one thing to you, Deedee.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.303
Katuk kak ci.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.685
What's...  Katuk kak  what?

13:30.769 --> 13:32.771
Oh, God. Um, it's hard to explain.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.106
It actually means, um,

13:35.190 --> 13:37.734
"Fuck your grandpa."
It's just...

13:37.817 --> 13:39.319
Well, that's not that hard to explain.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.197
Yeah, well, I don't know.
Just, in Balinese, it's super offensive.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.574
Yeah, well, it's offensive everywhere, no?

13:44.658 --> 13:47.494
-Yeah. I mean... It just...
-"Fuck your grandpa!"

13:47.577 --> 13:49.579
-It just made us laugh.
-It is funny.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.915
-Hi, everybody.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.042
I'm Tom's baby sister, Jeannie.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.961
-Yeah, Jeannie!
-Hey, Jeannie!

13:56.044 --> 13:58.505
Wow, Sean's speech, wasn't it somethin'?

14:06.596 --> 14:07.597
Honey?

14:09.307 --> 14:13.728
Maybe we should just,
you know, call it a night.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.438
No, babe, you go ahead.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.733
I gotta finish these centerpieces
and rearrange the seating chart

14:18.817 --> 14:20.944
now that Sean decided to show up.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.156
-Tom!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.200
Tom!

14:29.452 --> 14:31.162
Let's have sex.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.668
Yes. Yes.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.837
Just... Just... Just...
Just gimme... Just...

14:38.920 --> 14:40.922
I just have to finish
these pineapples real quick.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.551
Okay. Um...

14:45.218 --> 14:52.183
But do you really have to finish
pineapples right now?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.733
Oh, my God. I love you
in a T-shirt and no pants.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.236
I'm just gonna reach over here,

15:03.320 --> 15:06.615
this high shelf, so I can get
something to read.

15:06.698 --> 15:10.160
Why is it so sexy
when you can't reach high shelves?

15:12.871 --> 15:15.332
-So, um...

15:15.415 --> 15:16.875
I'm sorry, miss, but it was...

15:17.667 --> 15:18.918
-It's this one here?
-No, no, no.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.128
It's the one over there.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.546
-Sir, please.
-Oh, this one.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.797
-This one.
-Yes.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.258
-That?
-Thank you, sir.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.344
Okay. Glad I could help.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.193
I miss you.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.696
It's been a while, huh?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.657
I know.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.867
I miss you.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.795
Could I ask you a question?

16:02.337 --> 16:03.880
Is it a sexy question?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.341
Um...

16:06.841 --> 16:10.387
Just wondering why you called off
the engagement with Sean again.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.182
That is so not sexy.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.685
I... I told you this.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.687
We were young, we were in Bali,

16:18.770 --> 16:21.272
and then one day, I woke up
and it just didn't feel right.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.067
-Okay?
-Okay.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.199
But you said yes.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.077
You know, what changed your mind?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.580
I don't know.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.084
Uh, he... he started working with my dad,

16:41.167 --> 16:45.672
he changed, and all he cared about
was status and money.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.924
Anyway, why do you want
to talk about my ex

16:48.007 --> 16:49.634
the night before our wedding?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.887
I don't know. Maybe because
you invited him to our wedding?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.472
Remember, I didn't.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.600
My dad asked me to invite him.
What was I supposed to say?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.018
I don't know. Uh, no?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.438
If you remember correctly,
I didn't wanna invite anyone.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.940
-I wanted to elope.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.901
The only reason I agreed
to a traditional wedding

17:06.985 --> 17:09.904
was because you said that
we'd have moments alone.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.199
Hey, hello. It's Carol.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.745
Hi. Hello.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.122
Your future mother-in-law, Carol.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.332
Yep, I know your name, Carol.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.461
I brought some of the extras
for the welcome bags

17:24.544 --> 17:26.838
in case you want to make one for Sean.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.339
Oh! Oh.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.883
Great. Thanks.

17:30.592 --> 17:31.843
All right, thanks.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.512
Tommy, she's not wearing any pants.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.182
-I just want to ask,

17:37.265 --> 17:39.100
and... and I hope it's okay.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.643
Is that genetics,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.272
or is it, like, Pilates or something?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.440
Mom, now is not the time for this.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.942
Yes, all right. But, you know,
we need to get you outta here.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.820
It's the night before your wedding,
and you can't spend the night together.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.947
-No, Ma, it's just...
-You can't. It's bad luck.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.867
You know, his cousin, Jenna,
she spent the night with her husband.

17:55.950 --> 18:00.038
Lo and behold, she got Lyme disease,
and now she can't wear sandals.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.708
It's a tradition.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.940
Oh.
Look at the happy couple.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.655
Where have you been?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.907
You were supposed to do my hair.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.285
Now birds are gonna lay eggs in it.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.245
I know. I overslept. I'm sorry.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.582
Kind of, sort of,
slept with Ricky last night.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.293
-Ricky?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.837
I just, I was in the mood for something,
you know, that wasn't quite right.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.839
Like ordering a hamburger
at a sushi bar or something.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.133
I'm just gonna avoid him today. It's fine.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.676
He's Tom's best man.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.595
You two have to walk down
the aisle together.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.056
I am very good at ignoring people
that I'm standing next to.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.600
-No kidding.
-Ready?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.894
I can't believe you agreed
to wear Carol's wedding dress.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.520
-Okay.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.481
-Okay, okay.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.567
You look beautiful, no matter what.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.612
She's ready!

19:55.695 --> 19:56.654
Hey, should we all do

19:56.738 --> 19:57.906
-a round of tequila shots?

19:57.989 --> 20:01.492
Well, I Scotchgarded the dress,
so try not to inhale the chemicals.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.411
Where's the veil?
Where's the veil?

20:03.494 --> 20:04.746
Okay.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.039
Well, yes, tequila.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.582
Unless we get the bottle,
I'm not set.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.833
No, no tequila.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.168
Oh!

20:10.251 --> 20:12.670
The prettiest of them all.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.131
You look so much better
than the rest of us.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.967
This dress is just wonderful.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.552
I wore it for my wedding,

20:19.636 --> 20:23.806
Jeannie wore it for hers,
and now you're gonna wear it for yours.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.183
Oh, my gosh.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.226
Look at you.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.022
Oh, it's white coral made out of tissue.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.106
Um...

20:33.399 --> 20:36.319
Something doesn't, you know, feel right.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.904
Do you think
if we blew-dried the veil,

20:37.987 --> 20:39.364
-it would be more fluffy?
-Okay, so what I'm seeing is,

20:39.447 --> 20:40.531
I think that the left boob
is actually slightly lower

20:40.615 --> 20:42.033
-than the right boob.
-Like floof, floof, like that?

20:42.116 --> 20:45.620
Hey, something kinda magical
happened with me last night.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.288
-Theoretically speaking...

20:47.372 --> 20:49.499
...would it be weird or wonderful

20:49.582 --> 20:51.459
-if we married sisters?

20:51.542 --> 20:52.794
Yeah, sure.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.050
Hey, psst, Larry.
Tom's being boring.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.635
Come film me doing a backflip!

21:00.718 --> 21:02.261
Oh, I...
I don't think I should walk.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.388
All right.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.579
It's time.

21:41.843 --> 21:42.885
Wow!

21:43.803 --> 21:45.471
Look at you.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.981
Okay.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.191
You wanted to talk.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.570
I know it's last minute.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.031
I just...

22:05.324 --> 22:07.702
I hated the way things ended
last night, and...

22:08.411 --> 22:11.414
And I didn't want our wedding day
to start off on a bad note.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.126
Oh, my God.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.756
God, I thought you were calling it off.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.342
Calling off the wedding?

22:23.426 --> 22:24.594
-Why?
-Uh, I don't know.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.638
I mean, this weekend
hasn't exactly gone to plan.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.516
You and I have been arguing more
in the last few months than we did

22:30.600 --> 22:32.185
our first four years together.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.145
I don't know.
I guess I thought

22:34.228 --> 22:35.855
weddings were supposed to be fun.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.524
Oh. Okay.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.319
Well, I'm sorry I didn't make
your wedding more fun for you.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.488
Well, no. That's...
Darcy, that's not what...

22:45.573 --> 22:47.408
And it's not my wedding. It's our wedding.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.368
Hardly.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.412
Yeah, Tom.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.832
You got so fixated
on the wedding that you...

22:54.916 --> 22:56.542
you turned into a different person.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.628
I'm sorry. I just wanted
everything to be perfect.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.963
Why is that so important to you?

23:01.047 --> 23:02.590
Why isn't it important to you?

23:02.673 --> 23:04.008
It's like you don't even care
about the wedding.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.552
Well, I... Of course I care.

23:06.636 --> 23:07.762
Oh, yeah?

23:07.845 --> 23:10.014
You're the one that insisted
that we pay for this wedding.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.766
Yet I'm the one that's bargaining

23:11.849 --> 23:13.976
with all the vendors
and DIY-ing everything,

23:14.060 --> 23:16.687
and all you're saying is,
"I don't know. It looks good,"

23:16.771 --> 23:18.731
you know, "Sounds good, Tom.
Whatever you want."

23:18.815 --> 23:22.276
I told you that I did not want
a big traditional wedding.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.696
Okay? I'm not some blushing bride.
I'm a grown woman.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.032
I don't want my daddy
walking me down the aisle.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.118
I don't need a big princess dress,

23:30.201 --> 23:33.371
and I certainly don't need
a wedding registry.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.082
I have my things already.
I like my things.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.792
I wanted a Roomba.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.839
Well, she's not up in the lobby.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.215
I can't get through on my phone.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.717
Oh, my God. They've fallen in a ditch.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.928
What? And how do you know that?

23:49.011 --> 23:50.012
I don't know.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.348
I just have a sixth sense
about these things.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.683
Ace and I will take a look around.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.643
Don't worry. We will find them.

23:57.145 --> 23:59.147
-Check all ditches!
-God.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.236
I wanted it to just be you and me
in the middle of the ocean.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.822
And for the 400th time,
that would've killed my mother.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.532
Ugh. Right.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.200
And that's why I'm in your mother's dress

24:11.284 --> 24:13.870
with an extra 10 pounds of hair
on my head.

24:14.704 --> 24:18.875
But the truth is, you have not listened
to one thing I wanted since you proposed.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.587
Okay, well, Darcy, I'm listening.
Enlighten me.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.089
What is it? What is it that you want?

24:25.506 --> 24:28.885
Tom, we've... We talked about this.

24:28.968 --> 24:33.347
I told you on our very first date,
I didn't want a big wedding.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.473
Well, I thought you changed

24:34.557 --> 24:36.017
-your mind about that.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.352
Why did you even agree to do it then?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.899
Oh, I... I don't... I don't know!

24:42.982 --> 24:44.609
Okay? Because...

24:45.610 --> 24:48.446
Because I love you. Because I... I w...

24:48.529 --> 24:50.573
I wanted you to be happy.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.783
Go! Come on, move!

24:52.867 --> 24:54.952
Everybody, move! Come on!

24:55.036 --> 24:56.579
-Move along.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.207
Go outside, go outside right now.
Come on. Come on.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.043
If you don't wanna go through with this,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.212
it's not too late.

25:04.837 --> 25:05.838
What?

25:08.424 --> 25:14.347
No. We brought everybody that we loved
down to the Philippines for our wedding.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.432
I'm in this dress! We're doin' this!

25:16.515 --> 25:18.517
Oh, that was beautiful.
Are those your vows?

25:21.437 --> 25:22.480
Oh, my God.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.317
You convinced yourself
that I wanted to call off the wedding,

25:26.400 --> 25:27.652
and now you're making it happen.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.404
Oh, there you go. Lawyering yourself
out of any real responsibility.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.495
You cut me with your ring!

25:40.248 --> 25:42.375
-Won't happen again.

25:49.799 --> 25:50.925
Great!

25:51.676 --> 25:53.261
Why don't you go be with Sean?

25:53.761 --> 25:56.222
Maybe you guys could go bang
some grandpas!

26:05.773 --> 26:08.359
I don't know why.
I have a bad feeling about this.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.944
It's gonna be fine, honey.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.822
I think you might be overreacting.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.412
Hold still!
Get down, get down, get down!

26:25.293 --> 26:26.502
-No running!

26:26.585 --> 26:28.546
-Everyone!
-Get down.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.757
To the pool! Now!

26:31.841 --> 26:33.134
First rows, go!

26:33.217 --> 26:34.552
-Go, go, go!

26:34.635 --> 26:36.762
Everyone, this way! This way!

26:36.846 --> 26:39.640
Come on! Come on! One line! Let's go!

26:54.488 --> 26:55.781
Let's go!

26:57.658 --> 26:58.951
Darcy.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.873
-Guys, go!
-Go, go, up there.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.292
Up there!
Up there! Go! Go to the end.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.044
-Go, go!
-Everybody, walk!

27:08.127 --> 27:10.421
-Keep going.
-Let's go.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.672
Go!

27:13.049 --> 27:14.508
Keep moving! There you go.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.093
Turn. Turn. Go!

27:16.177 --> 27:17.386
-Line up.
-Keep moving.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.596
Line up, go!

27:18.679 --> 27:19.764
-Now!
-No.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.891
And into the pool.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.351
Now. Go!

27:23.434 --> 27:26.437
Go in. Faster, faster, faster.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.564
-Get in the water.
-Let's go faster.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.317
-Drop the phone.
-But my phone will get ruined.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.651
I think that's the point, sweetie.
Just drop it.

27:32.735 --> 27:33.861
Yeah, but I haven't
backed it up in a while.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.529
-Drop it!
-Okay. Okay.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.491
No need to be scared.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.994
As long as everybody follows directions,
no one gets hurt.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.997
Raise your hand when you hear your name.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.458
Robert Rivera.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.342
Robert! Robert.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.427
They're calling you.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.263
Thanks a lot, Carol.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.311
-Larry Fowler.
-Present.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.941
I... I'm Carol, his wife.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.526
Just so you don't have to make two trips.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.695
Wait, wait. I'd like it in the center.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.450
Sean Hawkins.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.413
If you hurt anyone in this pool,
you're gonna have to answer to me.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.041
Is this the hero of the group?

28:29.125 --> 28:30.709
Yes.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.129
No. Oh, my God.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.966
There is always one.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.635
All right.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.565
Where is bride and groom?

28:53.149 --> 28:55.568
She's there.
Isn't she the bride?

28:55.651 --> 28:56.652
Oh. No.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.031
Amanda thought it was appropriate
to wear white to a wedding.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.450
I didn't know that was a rule.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.868
Yes, you did.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.870
-You're a gaslighter.
-Yeah.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.538
You see, this is a problem.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.374
They could call police.
And if police come,

29:11.333 --> 29:12.543
we kill everyone.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.128
-Oh, my God.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.298
Okay, um, I... I saw Tom headed towards
the nature walk before the ceremony,

29:17.381 --> 29:20.551
and I noticed that his frequency levels
were dangerously low.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.219
I think he's getting cold feet.

29:22.303 --> 29:23.596
Tommy has cold feet?

29:23.679 --> 29:26.223
Is this really what we should be
worrying about at this point?

29:26.307 --> 29:29.518
I'm a mother. I can worry
about a lot of things at the same time.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.520
Like Larry's mole.

29:31.604 --> 29:32.813
Oh, it's fine, sweetie.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.440
-It's getting bigger.
-Spread out.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.484
-Look for them.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.700
Hey, uh, I... I...
I texted you this morning

29:44.783 --> 29:46.452
and I didn't hear anything back.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.413
Are you being serious right now?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.624
No. No.

29:54.668 --> 29:57.046
Darcy!

29:57.129 --> 30:00.090
-Darcy! Hey!

30:01.634 --> 30:03.511
-No, no, no, no. Darcy.

30:03.594 --> 30:06.055
-Darcy, I'm coming in.
-Fuck off, Tom!

30:06.138 --> 30:07.264
Oh, thank God.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.851
Listen, I know you're mad at me right now,
but you have to let me in.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.229
Why would I be mad? I'm awesome.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.481
I'm on a tropical island,
I'm having a liquid brunch,

30:15.564 --> 30:17.691
and I don't have to answer to anybody!

30:20.194 --> 30:23.113
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

30:23.531 --> 30:25.533
Oh, it is happening, buddy.

30:25.616 --> 30:29.203
Okay? And once I get this hair condo
off my head,

30:29.286 --> 30:32.623
I'm gonna march down to that beach
and tell everybody how you blew this up!

30:32.706 --> 30:33.832
Shh... shh!

30:33.916 --> 30:36.085
Are you seriously shushing me right now?

30:37.127 --> 30:38.295
What the fuck?

30:42.675 --> 30:43.676
Is that blood?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.053
There's no time
for a blood freak-out right now.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.055
-Don't tell me...

30:48.138 --> 30:50.849
-There are pirates outside,

30:50.933 --> 30:52.601
and they took everybody hostage.

30:52.685 --> 30:53.686
What?

31:10.494 --> 31:13.455
-We have to get help.
-No, no. No. No.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.959
-The phone is dead.
-Oh, the Wi-Fi too.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.211
Marge said the cell service
is better on the north side.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.130
Why did you pick an island
with no cell service?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.007
Because I wanted people to be present
and in the moment.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.883
-Jeez!

31:25.634 --> 31:28.429
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

31:28.512 --> 31:29.388
I know. Me neither.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.266
No. I... I really can't breathe.
It's the shapewear.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.767
Please help me get out of this dress now.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.353
Now!

31:36.437 --> 31:37.563
Would you relax?

31:37.646 --> 31:39.106
What did you just say to me?

31:39.189 --> 31:40.441
I said everything's gonna be okay.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.942
Dress is like a riddle.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.485
-Oh!

31:43.569 --> 31:45.571
God, I'm gonna die in this dress!

31:46.989 --> 31:48.991
Oh, door latches from the inside.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.118
He's gonna know we're in here.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.955
He's also gonna know we're in here
when he comes in here and we're in here.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.373
He'll think we're in the shower.

31:56.457 --> 31:57.958
What... What?

31:58.042 --> 32:00.502
And come back at a better time?
Leave a note?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.379
-All right.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.882
Okay, h... here's the plan. He comes in,
he's gonna think we're in the shower,

32:04.965 --> 32:06.592
then I jump out and I trap him in the net.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.093
Oh, my God, that's an amazing plan.

32:08.177 --> 32:09.219
-Yes!
-No!

32:09.303 --> 32:10.554
You're gonna throw a net over a pirate?

32:10.638 --> 32:11.805
Have you ever tried to get out of a net?

32:11.889 --> 32:13.140
It's very hard to get out of a net.

32:13.223 --> 32:14.850
Okay. How about...

32:14.933 --> 32:16.977
How about this? I spray him in the eyes.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.730
How is hairspray in the eyes
better than a net over his head?

32:19.813 --> 32:21.940
Wait! Yes, that's actually...

32:22.024 --> 32:24.109
That's actually... You spray that.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.070
I'll light the match.
It'll be like a flamethrower.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.404
-I mean, it won't work!
-Why?

32:27.488 --> 32:29.031
-Too many steps.
-It's two steps.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.784
It's two steps. Flamethrower, net.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.079
I pop out and I put the net over his head.
I'll surprise him.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.289
No, Tom, because bullets
shoot through nets!

32:37.373 --> 32:39.041
-Technically, yeah.
-Technically?

32:39.124 --> 32:40.584
Technically, he won't be able
to shoot straight

32:40.668 --> 32:42.961
because he'll be all fuckin'
wrapped up in the net.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.464
I swear to God, if you say "net"
one more time...

32:48.425 --> 32:50.511
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.728
Psst. Flamethrower.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.121
I'm gonna fuck him up.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.330
I'm gonna fuck him up.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.899
Fuck!

33:48.485 --> 33:49.611
-Ow!

33:49.695 --> 33:51.363
-Never mind! Never mind.
-Why did you do that?

33:51.447 --> 33:54.116
-Never mind!

33:56.326 --> 33:59.538
-You were right.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.623
That hairspray was
so much worse than the net.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.962
-Ow!
-Get up.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.088
Okay.

34:11.508 --> 34:13.051
-Come on.
-Don't strangle me.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.262
-Turn your arm.
-I have them alive.

34:15.345 --> 34:16.472
Wait, wait. What?

34:16.555 --> 34:19.183
Bungalow 15. Pick me up.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.810
Go collect them.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.022
And then we can begin.

34:33.697 --> 34:34.990
You doing okay, Jamie?

34:37.242 --> 34:39.495
My stomach feels like
it's gonna fall through my asshole.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.371
But otherwise, I'm chill.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.082
Listen, it's normal to feel scared.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.918
But I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you

34:46.502 --> 34:48.921
or your family. Promise.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.715
Hey, Sean?

34:52.257 --> 34:53.759
I am also feeling scared.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.761
Like the most scared
I've ever been in my whole life.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.096
It's like I just watched  The Ring,
you know?

34:59.640 --> 35:01.892
Robbie, baby, I want you
to practice the breathing exercise

35:01.975 --> 35:04.061
that we learned at Esalen, okay?

35:04.144 --> 35:06.855
I'm gonna hit a pressure point.
Ready? And...

35:08.440 --> 35:10.400
-Breathe. Breathe.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.277
From the diaphragm.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.404
-I think I'm gonna throw up now.
-It's okay. You're doing fine.

35:14.488 --> 35:18.283
If he keeps making that noise,
just go ahead and shoot me.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.037
The happy couple
will be here in a second.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.373
So let's get to business.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.375
Where is the father of the bride?

35:29.711 --> 35:32.339
Robert. He's calling ya again.

35:34.424 --> 35:37.261
Thanks, Carol.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.846
Okay, what do you want?

35:39.888 --> 35:44.268
Well, we call my colleague
on the satellite phone,

35:44.351 --> 35:47.479
and you transfer $45 million
to a bank account.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.064
What? What?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.649
I don't have that kind of money.

35:51.066 --> 35:55.404
We googled you.
Net worth is $60 million.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.490
I'm not giving you anything
until I find out if my daughter's safe.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.743
-And your son-in-law.
-Yeah, him too.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.537
Okay.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.248
I can wait two minutes
to take all your money.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.000
This way.

36:10.127 --> 36:12.045
You want some pineapple candies?

36:12.129 --> 36:15.507
They're from that weird welcome bag
we got, but I found them in my pocket.

36:15.591 --> 36:19.094
No, I don't want loose, wet candy
from your gross pockets.

36:21.638 --> 36:22.764
Okay.

36:23.557 --> 36:24.808
Suit yourself.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.274
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.358
-I'm starving.
-No.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.113
-You're an asshole.
-Hmm.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.157
God, I can't believe
that I had sex with you.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.451
Honestly, I was pretty surprised
by that too.

36:42.743 --> 36:45.078
My parents, they got divorced
when I was in high school,

36:45.162 --> 36:47.873
and my first engagement was a disaster.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.834
What about you? Are you dating anyone?

36:50.918 --> 36:52.252
Have you always wanted to be a pirate?

36:52.336 --> 36:54.379
No more talk, lady.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.803
Excuse me, sirs.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.138
Darcy, they're gonna hurt you.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.849
I just can't help but notice
that you guys smell like cigarettes,

37:05.933 --> 37:08.352
and I am loving it.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.854
Is there any way I could bum a cigarette?

37:10.938 --> 37:12.397
I mean, I think it might help with the...

37:12.481 --> 37:14.107
the panic and dread
I'm experiencing right now.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.400
Since when do you smoke cigarettes?

37:15.484 --> 37:16.610
It's...

37:17.778 --> 37:19.613
I just... You don't even
have to untie my hands.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.990
I mean, I... I can smoke with no hands.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.409
You could just put it right in my mouth.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.619
Give her a cigarette.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.371
-Please.
-Maybe it will shut her up.

37:27.454 --> 37:29.247
Yes, yes, yes, it will shut me up.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.626
Oh, thank you.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.588
You guys are the...

37:38.173 --> 37:39.174
best.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.842
-What?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.970
-Fire!

37:44.638 --> 37:46.056
Oh, my God!

37:46.139 --> 37:49.142
-Oh, my God! Flamethrower!

37:49.226 --> 37:50.352
-Oh, my...

37:50.435 --> 37:53.230
See, that's why you only have a plan
with one step!

37:56.108 --> 37:57.401
-No!
-Oh, my God!

37:57.484 --> 37:59.653
-Get the brakes!
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

38:07.536 --> 38:08.704
-Cliff!

38:08.787 --> 38:10.122
-Cliff! Cliff!
-I see it!

38:10.205 --> 38:11.540
Get it into park!

38:14.459 --> 38:16.128
-Oh, God! Oh, my God!
-God!

38:19.047 --> 38:20.215
Oh, slide out!

38:26.888 --> 38:29.391
My dress! My dress, Tom!

38:29.474 --> 38:30.767
Tom, don't let go!

38:30.851 --> 38:32.853
-Don't you let go!

38:33.186 --> 38:35.313
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

38:55.500 --> 38:57.294
-Go!

38:57.377 --> 38:59.421
Go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.095
Quick, do something baseball-y.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.222
What? This is nothing like baseball!

39:10.182 --> 39:11.975
-Down! Down, down!
-Fuck!

39:14.102 --> 39:16.855
-He's out of ammo.
-Right.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.356
-Run at him!
-What?

39:19.691 --> 39:21.234
-Go. Believe me, just go!
-No, no, no!

39:26.031 --> 39:27.949
-Grenade!
-He has a grenade!

39:28.867 --> 39:29.868
Sir!

39:29.951 --> 39:31.411
Sir, sir.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.080
Give me the grenade, sir. Sir!

39:33.163 --> 39:36.041
Sir, give me the grenade. Sir. Sir!

39:40.045 --> 39:42.047
-Ah-ow. Ow!

39:52.808 --> 39:54.601
Oh, my God.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.728
-Is he dead?
-I don't know.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.439
Are you dead?

40:07.739 --> 40:10.367
Oh, yeah, he's very not alive.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.452
Not alive. Oh, boy.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.454
-Yes! You killed him!
-Yeah!

40:14.538 --> 40:16.706
Yeah, I killed him! I killed him!

40:18.291 --> 40:20.460
Oh, my God, I killed a man.

40:20.544 --> 40:23.255
I killed a man. No.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.465
-How do you feel?

40:25.549 --> 40:27.676
I feel... Oh, my God. I feel horrible.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.178
-Yeah.
-But excited.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.347
You know, like, happy.
Like, I'm gonna shit my pants.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.431
-Yeah.
-You know, like,

40:33.515 --> 40:34.975
but in a good way. You know?

40:35.058 --> 40:36.226
Huh.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.769
Oh, my God.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.147
I'm gonna go to prison.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.314
-I'm gonna...
-No!

40:41.398 --> 40:43.066
-Yeah.
-No. It was... It...

40:43.150 --> 40:44.985
It was self-defense.
He was trying to kill us.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.403
Any court would...

40:47.237 --> 40:48.363
Any court...

40:49.030 --> 40:50.031
Are you okay?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.826
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.662
It's just, you know, I looked over there
and I saw all the blood.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.414
And, you know, I think I saw some brain.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.207
-Was that brain stuff?
-Yeah. Yeah.

40:59.291 --> 41:02.961
And so I'm just gonna look up at the sky
and... so I don't pass out.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.546
Okay. Well, you know what?
Maybe we should...

41:04.629 --> 41:06.047
-Let's just step away

41:06.131 --> 41:07.132
from the scene.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.258
-And don't look down.
-Okay.

41:08.341 --> 41:09.342
-Okay.
-Just don't look down.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.429
They should be here by now.

41:12.512 --> 41:13.513
Head up the road.

41:13.597 --> 41:14.931
-Check on them.
-Yeah.

41:20.604 --> 41:23.857
All right. We need to get off this island.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.985
Well, it might help that
I got this grenade for us.

41:27.068 --> 41:29.446
I mean, he was trying
to blow us up, but I got it.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.740
I got it. Another point for Darcy.

41:34.284 --> 41:35.911
Okay, Darcy.

41:35.994 --> 41:36.995
Uh...

41:37.829 --> 41:39.164
Do you remember

41:39.789 --> 41:41.666
that time that we were
driving down the highway

41:41.750 --> 41:44.794
and you very calmly told me to pull over?

41:44.878 --> 41:46.463
And you waited until we pulled over

41:46.546 --> 41:49.257
to tell me that there was
a giant spider on my head?

41:49.799 --> 41:51.176
Yeah. Yeah.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.510
Yeah, well, that was very smart.

41:52.928 --> 41:57.474
Because if you had told me before,
I might have panicked and crashed the car.

41:57.557 --> 41:58.767
Wait. Is there a spider on my head?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.268
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.312
No, no. I tell you this story because...

42:03.563 --> 42:04.648
I don't want you to panic

42:04.731 --> 42:06.650
when I tell you
what I'm about to tell you.

42:07.651 --> 42:10.362
Your grenade doesn't have a pin.

42:14.324 --> 42:16.034
-What does that mean?
-Well...

42:16.117 --> 42:17.911
Well, is it... is it...
is it gonna explode?

42:17.994 --> 42:19.829
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.040
Hold it exactly how you're
holding it. Good. Good.

42:22.332 --> 42:24.334
-Okay. Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.461
That pin holds the handle on.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.547
But when you let go of the grenade,
the handle pops off,

42:29.631 --> 42:32.509
which lights the fuse,
and the whole thing goes...

42:33.468 --> 42:34.511
boom.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.346
How do you know
so much about grenades?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.139
Video games.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.016
So what should I do?
Should... Should I throw it?

42:40.100 --> 42:43.770
Well, my concern is that you won't be able
to throw it far enough to not blow us up.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.814
-No offense.
-God.

42:46.189 --> 42:48.525
So, what, I just...
I just hold this live grenade?

42:48.608 --> 42:50.652
This grenade is just part of my life now?

42:50.735 --> 42:52.153
Yeah, for now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.492
Okay, here's the plan.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.869
We're gonna get a knife.

42:59.953 --> 43:00.912
-Okay. All right.
-I'm gonna cut

43:00.996 --> 43:03.206
through these ties,
we're gonna get rid of that grenade,

43:03.915 --> 43:05.250
and then we're gonna
head down to the docks.

43:05.333 --> 43:07.085
We're gonna bum-rush
the pirate guarding it,

43:07.168 --> 43:09.629
hop in a boat, and head
to the next island for help.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.466
-Okay?
-Tom, that plan...

43:13.550 --> 43:16.011
Has too many steps.
I see that now.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.722
Now, you got a simpler one?

43:19.681 --> 43:21.391
-Yes. Yes.
-What?

43:21.474 --> 43:23.351
-Yes. Okay.
-What are you doing?

43:23.435 --> 43:25.061
Get down here. Found it.

43:25.145 --> 43:26.604
-Found it. Yes.
-What are we doing?

43:26.688 --> 43:28.440
-Right here.
-What are we doing?

43:28.523 --> 43:30.650
-Oh.

43:31.318 --> 43:32.360
Oh.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.904
Find cell service. Call for help.

43:34.988 --> 43:36.406
When did you put that in your underwear?

43:37.824 --> 43:39.576
Right before the pirates
took us out of the cabana.

43:39.659 --> 43:41.494
Because I'm a sneaky little bitch.

43:41.578 --> 43:44.039
Oh, you are a sneaky little bitch.

43:44.748 --> 43:46.041
-Thank you.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.625
-Okay.
-Let's start walking.

43:47.709 --> 43:49.544
Sneaky. Sneaky little bitch.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.590
You're testing my patience, Robert!

43:53.673 --> 43:55.050
Look, you want my money?
I want my daughter.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.718
-It's a simple negotiation.
-Enough!

43:56.801 --> 43:57.802
All right.

43:57.886 --> 43:58.887
They're bringing him back.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.013
Move.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.474
Robert. What happened?
Are you okay?

44:02.557 --> 44:03.600
They didn't hurt you, did they?

44:03.683 --> 44:06.978
Well, I'm not giving them a dime
till I know my daughter's alive.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.855
That didn't go over very well.

44:09.439 --> 44:11.733
I'm afraid they're gonna start
shooting the hostages.

44:11.816 --> 44:12.859
I don't think
they're gonna do that.

44:12.942 --> 44:14.819
Isn't that exactly
what pirates do?

44:22.243 --> 44:24.913
Come out, Mr. Pirate Man!

44:32.003 --> 44:33.338
My name

44:34.464 --> 44:37.592
is Carol Elaine Fowler,

44:38.676 --> 44:40.470
and I deserve to live.

44:41.471 --> 44:44.516
Carol, what are you doing?

44:44.599 --> 44:46.101
I'm humanizing myself.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.811
I saw it
on  Good Morning America.

44:47.894 --> 44:51.523
If you humanize yourself to them,
they let you live.

44:54.192 --> 44:57.737
I am a wife. I am a mother.

44:58.196 --> 45:02.909
And I was Milford, Michigan's top realtor
in 1998,

45:02.992 --> 45:05.245
and again in 2007.

45:06.079 --> 45:09.374
I dream of going to Ireland.

45:10.041 --> 45:13.711
I was a late bloomer
and my teeth didn't come in till I was 14.

45:14.337 --> 45:15.380
Please pick me.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.549
My name is Jeannie Reed.

45:17.924 --> 45:22.220
I am a devoted mother
and a slightly less devoted wife.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.514
This is my first vacation without my kids,

45:24.597 --> 45:27.225
so I drank a lot of champagne
before the ceremony,

45:27.308 --> 45:28.268
took a couple of weed gummies,

45:28.351 --> 45:30.687
and the combination
is really killing me right now.

45:30.770 --> 45:34.983
I'm Amanda Walker.
I'm a godmother and a woman in tech.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.026
-I went to--
-I am Renata.

45:38.445 --> 45:40.113
I'm from Brazil.

45:41.114 --> 45:43.867
I have beautiful hair.

45:43.950 --> 45:44.909
Yeah. Very beautiful.

45:45.702 --> 45:46.828
What else?

45:48.455 --> 45:49.581
You're a mother.

45:50.457 --> 45:51.916
I am a mother.

45:53.126 --> 45:54.502
My name is Ricky Silver.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.629
A lot of my friends, they're pairing up,

45:56.713 --> 45:59.632
and they're getting married
and drinking loose-leaf tea and shit.

45:59.716 --> 46:01.718
And I'm still single. But last night...

46:03.261 --> 46:06.973
I made love to a gorgeous
and terrifying woman.

46:07.515 --> 46:08.808
You think I'm terrifying?

46:09.893 --> 46:11.644
You scare the shit out of me.

46:16.649 --> 46:18.151
I'm Larry Fowler.

46:23.448 --> 46:24.449
Oh...

46:24.949 --> 46:25.950
Thank you.

46:27.494 --> 46:28.912
-Oh.
-Oh, easy, Dad.

46:29.913 --> 46:31.080
-Hold the phone. Yes.
-How am I gonna...

46:31.164 --> 46:32.248
-Hold it steady.
-Hold it. Hold on.

46:32.332 --> 46:34.751
I just gotta get this thing
out of my head.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.712
It's driving me crazy.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.839
-Wait. Hold on. Just wait.
-What are you...

46:41.132 --> 46:43.134
What are you...
Are you stuffing a loose wad

46:43.218 --> 46:44.719
of hair in my pocket?

46:44.802 --> 46:47.347
Yes. A loose wad of very expensive,

46:47.430 --> 46:49.432
custom-made hair
that I would like to keep.

46:49.516 --> 46:50.892
If we survive.

46:53.686 --> 46:55.021
What's so funny?

46:57.106 --> 46:58.858
-I've just been...
-Ow, ow, ow!

46:58.942 --> 47:01.611
...questioning everything lately.

47:01.694 --> 47:04.739
What if the wedding's not perfect?
What if your parents never like me?

47:04.822 --> 47:06.950
What does life look like after baseball?

47:07.033 --> 47:08.785
But not once did I wonder

47:08.868 --> 47:13.081
if I'd be walking handcuffed
through the jungle with a live grenade.

47:13.790 --> 47:17.961
Oh. Pirates chasing you
wasn't on your vision board?

47:18.044 --> 47:20.213
Well, you were the only thing
on my vision board.

47:23.633 --> 47:24.717
-I got it, I got it, I got it.
-Oh! Oh!

47:24.801 --> 47:26.386
-You got it? You got it?
-I got it. I got it.

47:26.469 --> 47:29.347
-Okay. I got it.
-Oh, good. Okay. Oh.

47:31.558 --> 47:33.518
-We have a bar.
-Oh, good.

47:34.227 --> 47:35.270
All right.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.688
-Keep your hands with me.
-Okay.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.439
-Okay.
-Call for help.

47:38.523 --> 47:40.441
Yes. Shit! It's gone.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.027
-Well, keep trying.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.866
-I think, maybe...
-We have to go higher.

47:48.950 --> 47:50.201
-What?
-Yes.

47:50.743 --> 47:53.246
Not... No. No, no, no.
Uh, I don't like higher.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.051
Yeah, I don't... I don't think
this thing is built to code.

48:07.135 --> 48:08.678
-Tom.
-Anything?

48:08.761 --> 48:10.680
No. Come on.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.641
-Yeah.
-We're almost at the top.

48:13.725 --> 48:16.769
Maybe we should go back down
so we're not up so high.

48:16.853 --> 48:19.731
Don't think about the heights right now.
Okay? We're safe.

48:19.814 --> 48:21.899
Yeah. You use the word "safe"
very loosely.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.027
Oh, my God.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.116
-Full service. Full service.
-Oh, yes.

48:30.199 --> 48:31.451
-I have full service.

48:31.534 --> 48:32.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Silence it.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.454
-I'm trying.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.252
Your group chat is out of control.

48:41.336 --> 48:43.338
I will not apologize
for having enthusiastic friends.

48:46.841 --> 48:48.092
Oh! You dropped it.

48:48.176 --> 48:49.969
-Come on!

48:50.511 --> 48:52.221
-We gotta zip.
-Zip?

48:52.305 --> 48:53.598
What do you mean, "zip"?

48:54.599 --> 48:56.684
-Oh! Zip. Oh, God!

48:56.768 --> 48:58.019
Go, go, go.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.563
No, I don't think we have
the proper equipment.

49:00.647 --> 49:02.106
-Well, they have guns.

49:02.190 --> 49:03.316
Is there some kind of a manual?

49:03.399 --> 49:04.442
Come down!

49:04.525 --> 49:06.986
We need helmets.
I see lots of helmets in the photos.

49:08.071 --> 49:09.405
And then why do they look scared?

49:09.489 --> 49:11.157
Stop thinking so much. Jump!

49:17.747 --> 49:20.541
-Stop screaming!
-Oh, God! Oh, my God!

49:20.625 --> 49:21.876
Whoa!

49:21.959 --> 49:23.127
Tom, don't let go.

49:23.211 --> 49:25.213
-The fuck!

49:29.300 --> 49:31.177
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.470
Okay.

49:38.226 --> 49:39.227
Uh...

49:40.269 --> 49:43.690
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

49:44.357 --> 49:46.192
What the hell was that?

49:56.911 --> 49:57.954
Oh, God!

50:00.540 --> 50:02.250
-Oh, God!
-How do we land this thing?

50:02.333 --> 50:03.793
Me first. I'm gonna go first.

50:03.876 --> 50:06.796
-What about me?
-No, let me. Me first.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.464
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.

50:08.548 --> 50:10.800
-Okay, okay.
-I got it. I got it.

50:10.883 --> 50:12.135
Here I go!

50:45.376 --> 50:47.044
These people are sick.

50:47.795 --> 50:51.215
You find them, but I kill them.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.803
You can have the man,

50:56.846 --> 50:58.639
but the bride is mine.

51:01.684 --> 51:03.519
Police, coast guard,
they're all right there.

51:03.603 --> 51:04.937
-How do we get across?
-I don't know.

51:05.021 --> 51:07.607
Okay, let's all go around
and play two truths and a lie.

51:07.690 --> 51:08.733
Be quiet!

51:08.816 --> 51:10.026
-Carol.
-Mom.

51:10.485 --> 51:11.861
-Easy.

51:12.695 --> 51:13.905
Okay, come on.

51:14.655 --> 51:15.948
Come on, come on, come on.

51:20.995 --> 51:22.413
Oh, my God.

51:22.497 --> 51:23.873
Oh, my God.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.126
I'm gonna fix this.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.548
My poor mom.

51:32.632 --> 51:35.468
She thought she was gonna be able
to avoid my dad all weekend.

51:37.053 --> 51:39.597
My mom used to love my dad so much.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.726
He was her whole world.

51:43.810 --> 51:46.604
Then when he left, she just lost her joy.

51:47.647 --> 51:49.232
I mean, she acts tough, but...

51:51.901 --> 51:53.611
she never really recovered.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.618
-Darcy, I'm sorry...
-I know.

52:02.328 --> 52:03.704
We have to keep moving.

52:19.554 --> 52:21.430
What the hell does that mean?

52:25.017 --> 52:26.018
Kitchen.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.191
Okay, we need to find a knife.

52:32.692 --> 52:34.777
-Oh. Mmm.
-What... What...

52:34.861 --> 52:35.820
What are you doing?

52:35.903 --> 52:37.405
I'm starving. Have you eaten today?

52:37.488 --> 52:38.573
No, I'm not hungry.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.032
Yes, you are. You're acting cranky.

52:40.116 --> 52:42.994
-Mmm. Mmm! Mmm.
-Mmm.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.956
-Mmm, this is so delicious.

52:58.217 --> 52:59.844
I love your mom.

52:59.927 --> 53:01.220
Okay, come on.

53:02.305 --> 53:04.181
Come on. Ow! Easy, easy.

53:04.265 --> 53:05.558
I can't cut with one hand.

53:05.641 --> 53:07.268
Well, I can't cut with no hands.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.691
We need to find something else.

53:13.774 --> 53:14.901
Okay?

53:15.651 --> 53:17.987
Something that cuts through plastic.

53:18.905 --> 53:20.281
Hmm...

53:22.909 --> 53:23.910
Yep.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.374
-Is this a bad idea?
-Yeah.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.293
-You ready?
-No!

53:33.920 --> 53:34.921
Okay.

53:37.798 --> 53:39.383
There you go.

53:41.177 --> 53:42.595
Hang on, hang on, hang on!

53:42.678 --> 53:43.804
Darcy, you're stalling.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.014
-I know.
-We got this.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.182
-Okay. Yes.
-We got this.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.559
-On my count. Ready?
-Okay.

53:48.643 --> 53:51.479
-Yes.
-Ten, nine, eight...

53:51.562 --> 53:53.230
Why are you counting from ten?

53:53.314 --> 53:54.565
What is this, a rocket launch?

53:54.649 --> 53:55.691
Okay, fine. On four.

53:56.317 --> 53:59.779
One, two, three--

53:59.862 --> 54:01.280
No one goes on four.

54:01.364 --> 54:02.823
-No one goes on four.
-All right...

54:02.907 --> 54:04.158
Shh! Shh.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.993
-Okay.
-Just...

54:06.077 --> 54:08.245
-Just like a Band-Aid.
-Fine, fine.

54:08.329 --> 54:09.538
-Ready? Go.
-Like a Band-Aid.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.802
Oh, my God.

54:27.223 --> 54:28.683
Come on.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.804
Tom!

55:08.597 --> 55:09.849
Tom.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.652
I thought you left.

56:05.112 --> 56:06.197
What?

56:08.657 --> 56:09.658
No.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.536
Never.

56:16.916 --> 56:18.334
Where'd your mom's knife go?

56:29.678 --> 56:31.514
Oh, Jesus, help me.

56:37.603 --> 56:39.271
That's good.

56:40.689 --> 56:41.941
Throw me those boots.

57:07.842 --> 57:08.843
What?

57:09.760 --> 57:12.805
That dress is growing on me.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.642
Thanks.

57:17.393 --> 57:19.019
I wanted something less traditional.

57:48.299 --> 57:51.177
Yes. Maybe Margy's got
a hard line to the Internet.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.305
Wow, does Margy love corgis.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.850
No. Damn it.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.686
You go over there,
I'll go here.

58:00.769 --> 58:02.146
-Yeah.
-They're right there.

58:02.229 --> 58:03.772
-What do I do?
-I don't know.

58:04.190 --> 58:05.566
I don't know.

58:08.194 --> 58:09.737
-Oh, Margy.
-This way.

58:09.820 --> 58:10.905
Go, go, go.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.324
Okay. I got you.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.284
It's okay. It's okay.

58:17.453 --> 58:19.121
Come. Faster, faster.

58:20.122 --> 58:21.874
Ace, Margy...

58:21.957 --> 58:23.751
-Is this your bunker?
-Uh-huh.

58:23.834 --> 58:24.793
-Man cave.
-Is it spinning?

58:24.877 --> 58:25.920
Is it spinning for anyone else?

58:26.295 --> 58:28.047
You're losing blood. Sit down.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.674
-Sit down. Okay.
-Bandages. Ace.

58:30.758 --> 58:32.426
I'll get the medical kit.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.136
Give me your hand. I'm gonna wrap it.

58:34.220 --> 58:36.096
No. No, no, no. No.

58:36.722 --> 58:38.182
Are you sure? It's disgusting.

58:39.683 --> 58:40.684
Yeah.

58:47.524 --> 58:48.817
Oh. Cheers.

58:51.779 --> 58:52.988
Okay.

58:53.072 --> 58:55.449
Looks like it's got a flap.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.160
It's got a loose flap.

58:58.244 --> 58:59.411
-Listen, just be...
-Mm-hmm.

59:00.079 --> 59:02.289
Just... Just be careful with the flap.

59:02.373 --> 59:04.750
Please stop saying "flap," okay?

59:04.833 --> 59:06.961
I'm totally fine. Just don't say flap.

59:07.753 --> 59:09.838
-How many are there?
-Uh...

59:09.922 --> 59:13.259
Two in the lobby.
Couple more by the pool with the hostages.

59:13.342 --> 59:16.345
And, uh, one by the dock, right?

59:16.428 --> 59:18.681
But we got four.

59:19.431 --> 59:20.933
What do you mean, "got"?

59:24.228 --> 59:26.647
Got them to stop, you know,

59:27.898 --> 59:29.149
being alive.

59:29.942 --> 59:31.610
Holy shit.

59:31.694 --> 59:33.988
Well, yeah, we didn't see
any of your staff, though.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.323
I saw them getting locked up in the spa.

59:36.407 --> 59:37.908
They never bother with the locals.

59:37.992 --> 59:41.245
Americans are the rich idiots. No offense.

59:41.328 --> 59:44.164
I just don't understand
why the pirates are still here.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.000
Last time, they just looted the rooms.

59:46.083 --> 59:49.169
Twenty minutes, gone.

59:50.462 --> 59:51.672
What do you mean, "last time"?

59:51.755 --> 59:53.590
Last year.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.634
Two thousand islands
in the Philippines,

59:55.718 --> 59:56.885
and they hit us twice?

59:56.969 --> 59:58.345
-It's not fair.
-Wait, wait.

59:59.346 --> 1:00:01.682
The pirates were here last summer?

1:00:01.765 --> 1:00:03.267
And you let us have our wedding here?

1:00:03.350 --> 1:00:06.854
What? Tom-Tom. We talked about it, huh?

1:00:09.398 --> 1:00:10.399
You knew about this?

1:00:10.482 --> 1:00:12.526
Well, first of all,
nobody got killed last summer.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:13.652
And we both agreed that

1:00:13.736 --> 1:00:15.946
the chances of it happening again
were very small.

1:00:16.030 --> 1:00:17.823
-Who's "we"?
-Me and Margy.

1:00:18.490 --> 1:00:19.616
We e-mailed a lot,

1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:21.535
and I asked a lot of
tough questions, didn't I?

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:23.787
How could you not tell me about this?

1:00:23.871 --> 1:00:25.372
You didn't tell me that
you were having doubts

1:00:25.456 --> 1:00:26.623
about getting married, so...

1:00:26.707 --> 1:00:29.585
Yeah, you're right. I didn't.
You know why?

1:00:29.918 --> 1:00:33.839
Because all last year,
you were in your head about everything.

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:36.717
You thought my dad didn't like you,
so you started acting all weird.

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:38.093
And now my dad doesn't like you.

1:00:38.761 --> 1:00:40.304
You thought the Robins
were gonna drop you.

1:00:40.387 --> 1:00:42.723
And then you started playing badly,
and they did drop you.

1:00:42.806 --> 1:00:44.808
You think that something bad
is gonna happen,

1:00:44.892 --> 1:00:46.727
and then you make it happen.

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:48.270
That's called self-sabotage.

1:00:48.354 --> 1:00:50.397
It is. Ace, thank you.

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:53.525
And all you were excited about
was this wedding.

1:00:53.609 --> 1:00:56.653
And I knew that if I told you
that I was having doubts,

1:00:56.737 --> 1:00:58.781
that you would sabotage
our whole relationship.

1:00:58.864 --> 1:01:00.407
Which you did anyway!

1:01:00.491 --> 1:01:02.034
I didn't sabotage anything.

1:01:02.534 --> 1:01:04.244
I tried to make this wedding perfect.

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:07.081
And it all got ruined the day
your boy Sean showed up.

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:08.874
This has nothing to do with Sean.

1:01:08.957 --> 1:01:10.709
This is about your insecurities.

1:01:10.793 --> 1:01:12.127
And this whole wedding

1:01:12.211 --> 1:01:14.713
was your way of trying
to get control of your life,

1:01:14.797 --> 1:01:16.048
because you have to control everything.

1:01:16.131 --> 1:01:19.009
It's like when you get out of the car
to "help me" parallel park,

1:01:19.093 --> 1:01:20.677
when I can do it just fine on my own.

1:01:20.761 --> 1:01:22.388
Yeah, I wouldn't call
a 17-point turn "just fine."

1:01:22.471 --> 1:01:24.556
Well, those jeans you bought
from Old Navy last month

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:25.891
were women's jeans.

1:01:25.974 --> 1:01:27.142
Uh...

1:01:27.226 --> 1:01:28.685
Well, I found them in the men's section.

1:01:28.769 --> 1:01:30.104
They made you look like Stevie Nicks.

1:01:30.187 --> 1:01:32.731
That haircut that you got last year,
I hated it.

1:01:32.815 --> 1:01:35.359
It made your head look square.
You looked like a fucking Simpson.

1:01:35.442 --> 1:01:36.985
You said it was chic.

1:01:37.069 --> 1:01:38.779
You act so confident,

1:01:38.862 --> 1:01:40.572
so strong,
but you're just a scared little girl.

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:44.493
You're afraid to go all in
on this relationship

1:01:44.576 --> 1:01:46.870
because it means you might
have something to lose.

1:01:53.836 --> 1:01:56.046
Well, you know what?
None of it matters anyway.

1:01:57.131 --> 1:02:00.342
Because everyone we love could die.

1:02:03.679 --> 1:02:04.972
Because of me.

1:02:25.367 --> 1:02:26.952
I think they're
in the manager's house.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:00.569
I think they heard it.

1:03:00.652 --> 1:03:01.820
Why?

1:03:01.904 --> 1:03:03.572
They stopped speaking English.

1:03:05.324 --> 1:03:06.742
Here. Take it.

1:03:08.327 --> 1:03:09.953
Don't. Tom.

1:03:12.414 --> 1:03:14.333
We need to get out of here.
Where does this tunnel go?

1:03:14.416 --> 1:03:17.544
It leads straight to the pool
where the rest of the pirates are.

1:03:17.628 --> 1:03:19.171
Oh, that's not ideal.

1:03:23.383 --> 1:03:24.760
What are they saying?

1:03:25.344 --> 1:03:26.512
No clue.

1:03:26.595 --> 1:03:30.015
I don't know what language that is,
but it ain't Filipino.

1:03:30.766 --> 1:03:32.142
-No.
-No.

1:03:36.605 --> 1:03:38.482
No one move. Stay right here.

1:03:39.066 --> 1:03:40.192
Nobody move.

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:42.861
What are you doing?

1:03:52.704 --> 1:03:53.705
Okay.

1:03:54.122 --> 1:03:56.792
They know someone's here,
but they don't know all of us are.

1:03:58.961 --> 1:04:01.964
You stay here until it's over.

1:04:03.298 --> 1:04:04.258
Tom!

1:04:08.637 --> 1:04:10.764
Tom! They're gonna kill you.

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:12.474
-Don't do this.
-I have to.

1:04:13.141 --> 1:04:15.394
This isn't about us anymore. This is...

1:04:16.061 --> 1:04:19.064
This whole thing is my fault.

1:04:22.276 --> 1:04:24.069
You deserve better.

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:25.862
Wait, Tom!

1:04:38.458 --> 1:04:39.876
Uh... Oh, hey.

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:41.253
Hey, pirates!

1:04:41.336 --> 1:04:43.714
I'm Tom, the groom you guys
have been looking for,

1:04:43.797 --> 1:04:44.798
and I am officially surrendering.

1:04:44.881 --> 1:04:45.882
-Shut up!
-All right.

1:04:45.966 --> 1:04:47.301
What, you don't like
to be called "pirates"?

1:04:47.384 --> 1:04:50.512
I wanted to be a pirate when I was a kid,
and you guys are actually doin' it.

1:04:50.596 --> 1:04:52.014
-Move.
-You're livin' the dream.

1:04:52.097 --> 1:04:53.056
Congratulations.

1:04:53.515 --> 1:04:56.393
They didn't kill him. Oh, my God.

1:04:56.476 --> 1:04:57.686
He's still alive.

1:04:59.771 --> 1:05:00.772
Go!

1:05:01.523 --> 1:05:03.734
Keep going. Just move.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:08.322
Tommy. Oh, my God.
It's Tommy. Tommy!

1:05:08.405 --> 1:05:10.157
-Shut up!

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.783
-Tommy, where is Darcy?
-Shut up!

1:05:11.867 --> 1:05:14.745
Yes. Where is your bride?

1:05:14.828 --> 1:05:16.496
-I... I don't know.

1:05:17.664 --> 1:05:19.750
Truly. Honestly. I... I... I don't.

1:05:19.833 --> 1:05:22.294
For reals. I don't...
I don't... I don't know.

1:05:23.337 --> 1:05:24.796
You're a bad liar.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:26.423
Yeah, he is a bad liar.

1:05:26.506 --> 1:05:29.426
Tom, if you know something,
the best thing you can do is cooperate.

1:05:29.509 --> 1:05:31.094
All they want is the money.

1:05:32.137 --> 1:05:35.599
You know what? Thank you, Sean,
as always, for being the voice of reason.

1:05:35.682 --> 1:05:36.683
Enough!

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:40.270
-Okay, fine!
-Okay.

1:05:41.229 --> 1:05:42.648
I'll tell you where she is.

1:05:48.362 --> 1:05:49.696
Katuk kak ci.

1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:50.739
-What?

1:05:52.199 --> 1:05:53.659
Holy shit. What did you say to him?

1:05:53.742 --> 1:05:55.160
It's kind of an inside joke, Sean.

1:05:55.243 --> 1:05:56.662
Can you give me a hand?
I'm a little woozy.

1:05:56.745 --> 1:05:58.455
'Course, man. Here, I got you.

1:05:58.538 --> 1:06:00.957
-Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1:06:01.041 --> 1:06:03.293
-What the hell are you doing?

1:06:03.377 --> 1:06:05.337
Don't move or I swear to God,
you'll lose an eye.

1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:06.588
Tommy, what are you doing?

1:06:06.672 --> 1:06:08.256
Are you gonna spill the beans or should I?

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:09.341
What beans?

1:06:09.424 --> 1:06:10.884
Just spill the beans.

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:12.552
Sean hired these guys

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:15.097
to invade our wedding
to take Robert's money!

1:06:15.722 --> 1:06:17.265
Whoa. No, no, no, no, Tom.

1:06:17.349 --> 1:06:18.433
No, it's true.

1:06:18.517 --> 1:06:20.977
That is a serious accusation,

1:06:21.061 --> 1:06:22.437
but it's okay,

1:06:22.521 --> 1:06:24.731
'cause jealousy can get
the best of any of us.

1:06:24.815 --> 1:06:26.316
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not jealous.

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:27.734
-Kind of.

1:06:27.818 --> 1:06:30.570
It is completely normal
for you to see me as a threat

1:06:30.654 --> 1:06:31.988
because Deedee and I

1:06:32.072 --> 1:06:33.865
-had something transcendent.

1:06:33.949 --> 1:06:36.118
But I am not a bad guy.

1:06:36.201 --> 1:06:38.328
And I definitely don't have
anything to do with these pirates.

1:06:38.412 --> 1:06:42.374
Oh, yeah? Then why did he deck me
when I told him to go fuck his grandpa?

1:06:42.457 --> 1:06:44.459
Just listen. Listen to yourself.

1:06:44.543 --> 1:06:46.712
I said it in Balinese.
These guys are not local.

1:06:46.795 --> 1:06:48.088
They're from Bali.

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:51.174
Margy said the local pirates
just looted and left last time.

1:06:51.258 --> 1:06:52.759
It took 'em, like, 20 minutes.

1:06:52.843 --> 1:06:54.261
Oh, God. "Last time"?

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:56.263
We were clearly targeted.
This whole thing was planned.

1:06:56.346 --> 1:06:59.141
They knew about Robert's money.

1:06:59.224 --> 1:07:02.561
And none of it made sense
until I found this.

1:07:06.106 --> 1:07:07.691
Ricky, grab my... Grab the... the...

1:07:07.774 --> 1:07:09.276
-Yeah, yeah.
-In my front pocket. Grab...

1:07:09.359 --> 1:07:10.485
There's an envelope in my front pocket.

1:07:10.569 --> 1:07:12.654
-Just grab it!

1:07:13.113 --> 1:07:14.156
There you go.

1:07:14.239 --> 1:07:15.699
A-ha!

1:07:16.116 --> 1:07:17.367
Slow, slow. Go slow.

1:07:19.161 --> 1:07:20.370
Your wedding invitation?

1:07:20.454 --> 1:07:22.998
Yes, but I got it off
of one of these guys.

1:07:23.081 --> 1:07:25.459
Now, how did they get that invitation?

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:27.127
-I don't know.
-Uh...

1:07:27.210 --> 1:07:29.588
It had to be given to him
by an invited guest.

1:07:30.505 --> 1:07:33.425
Now, what invited guest
could that be? Huh?

1:07:36.011 --> 1:07:37.429
Ricky, op... open it.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:40.682
A-ha!

1:07:42.142 --> 1:07:46.605
This asshat thought it was appropriate
to show up to a wedding he didn't RSVP to!

1:07:46.688 --> 1:07:48.774
He didn't RSVP!

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:50.776
Mom, that's not the main issue right now.

1:07:50.859 --> 1:07:54.362
Look, I'm a mother. I can be upset
about a lot of things at the same time.

1:07:54.446 --> 1:07:55.989
I think, right now, we should be upset
about one thing.

1:07:56.573 --> 1:07:59.159
-Oh, okay.
-Sean had these guys

1:07:59.242 --> 1:08:01.661
crash our wedding
so that he could get a big fat ransom

1:08:01.745 --> 1:08:03.246
from his best friend, Robert.

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:08.126
Huh? Yeah!

1:08:08.210 --> 1:08:10.212
-Bob... Bob.
-Yes!

1:08:10.295 --> 1:08:11.713
This is because I didn't give you

1:08:11.797 --> 1:08:13.548
that investment money
you wanted, isn't it?

1:08:13.632 --> 1:08:15.050
-Yeah.
-No, no, it's not like that.

1:08:15.133 --> 1:08:16.802
-How could...  Papi.

1:08:16.885 --> 1:08:19.554
How could you believe
that I would come here and betray ev...

1:08:19.638 --> 1:08:20.847
Believe it, Robert. Believe it.

1:08:21.973 --> 1:08:23.934
-That's right. That's right.
-Shit.

1:08:31.983 --> 1:08:35.654
See? See, I told ya! I told ya!

1:08:36.863 --> 1:08:41.535
These lanterns are so intricate.
Is there a note in it?

1:08:46.414 --> 1:08:48.792
"Be excellent to each other."

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:50.544
-Hmm.
-Hmm. Huh.

1:08:58.510 --> 1:09:01.513
It's from  Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

1:09:02.722 --> 1:09:06.351
Tom wanted to put a movie quote
in each one of the lanterns, and I...

1:09:06.434 --> 1:09:09.729
I thought it was stupid, but it's not.

1:09:09.813 --> 1:09:12.023
It's sweet.

1:09:12.107 --> 1:09:14.025
And I messed it all up.

1:09:14.109 --> 1:09:16.152
I don't know how you guys do it.

1:09:16.236 --> 1:09:19.281
You must have something
really special.

1:09:19.739 --> 1:09:22.325
-Not really.
-Oi.

1:09:22.409 --> 1:09:26.204
Uh, I mean, it is special
but it is not magic.

1:09:26.288 --> 1:09:28.373
We just made a vow.

1:09:28.456 --> 1:09:31.126
And we've messed things up
thousands of times.

1:09:31.209 --> 1:09:35.171
But when we break something, we fix it.

1:09:49.686 --> 1:09:53.064
Darcy, we come with you,
but we don't want to.

1:09:59.738 --> 1:10:01.740
Tommy finally made the big leagues.

1:10:01.823 --> 1:10:04.034
Yeah, I never heard that one before.

1:10:04.451 --> 1:10:06.119
I know you haven't.

1:10:06.828 --> 1:10:09.331
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

1:10:09.414 --> 1:10:10.916
I don't... I... I don't... I don't know.

1:10:10.999 --> 1:10:13.793
-You're lying.
-No, I'm... I'm... Honestly,

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:15.420
-I don't know.
-Okay.

1:10:19.049 --> 1:10:20.091
God damn it!

1:10:20.175 --> 1:10:21.468
-Would you stop doing that?
-Yeah.

1:10:21.551 --> 1:10:24.429
-He'll do it again.
-Fine. Fine.

1:10:24.512 --> 1:10:25.597
I was lying.

1:10:27.557 --> 1:10:30.685
After we cut ourselves loose,
Darcy and I got into a fight.

1:10:30.769 --> 1:10:33.188
She hopped in a golf cart
to go look for cell reception

1:10:33.271 --> 1:10:35.941
up by the northern coast
near the cliffs, and then I...

1:10:36.024 --> 1:10:38.109
I came back here
to try to rescue everyone.

1:10:38.652 --> 1:10:39.819
Come on!

1:10:43.990 --> 1:10:45.200
Okay.

1:10:46.826 --> 1:10:48.286
We'll take the chopper to find her.

1:10:48.370 --> 1:10:49.788
I'm comin' with you.

1:10:49.871 --> 1:10:51.915
I've been watching you
mess this up all day.

1:10:51.998 --> 1:10:53.667
This is my show now.

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:55.126
Wow, that's really good.

1:10:55.210 --> 1:10:56.962
We're doing this my way now. You got it?

1:10:57.879 --> 1:10:58.964
We need collateral.

1:11:09.516 --> 1:11:10.517
Get the girlfriend.

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:12.894
-Hey. Come.

1:11:12.978 --> 1:11:14.938
-Here. Move!
-Ow! Hey.

1:11:15.021 --> 1:11:16.564
Oh, no.

1:11:16.648 --> 1:11:18.692
-Go. Move!
-Please, I'm a Gemini.

1:11:18.775 --> 1:11:20.485
I bruise easily.

1:11:21.444 --> 1:11:22.779
-Go!
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:11:22.862 --> 1:11:24.656
-Oh, my God!
-Robert? Robert!

1:11:25.365 --> 1:11:27.617
When I get back,
that money better be in my account.

1:11:27.701 --> 1:11:29.369
And if it's not, she's dead.

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:31.371
And I treated you just like a son.

1:11:32.038 --> 1:11:33.957
-You're stuck with Tommy now.
-Robert.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:36.251
-Well, what's wrong with that?
-Fuck off.

1:11:58.481 --> 1:12:00.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:12:04.446 --> 1:12:05.488
Darcy...

1:12:05.572 --> 1:12:10.368
Tom, you promised you wouldn't
leave my side this weekend.

1:12:10.452 --> 1:12:11.870
Darcy, what are you doing?

1:12:12.287 --> 1:12:13.455
Tom, listen.

1:12:13.955 --> 1:12:16.541
I'm still mad at you
for picking this pirate island,

1:12:16.624 --> 1:12:19.210
but I messed up too.
I should've told you...

1:12:20.503 --> 1:12:22.422
how scared I was to get married.

1:12:23.173 --> 1:12:24.507
That wasn't fair.

1:12:24.591 --> 1:12:26.426
You worked so hard
on this pirate island wedding.

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:28.511
Okay, no, no, no.
Please stop calling it that.

1:12:28.595 --> 1:12:30.889
I just worried that if I told you...

1:12:33.516 --> 1:12:34.934
that I would lose you.

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:40.607
And I can't lose you.

1:12:43.193 --> 1:12:44.444
I need you.

1:12:48.531 --> 1:12:49.741
Okay?

1:12:53.411 --> 1:12:54.412
Okay?

1:12:54.496 --> 1:12:55.413
-Okay.

1:12:55.497 --> 1:12:57.082
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:12:57.165 --> 1:12:59.209
This is so much better than  South Pacific.

1:12:59.292 --> 1:13:00.752
And Mom, Dad?

1:13:03.254 --> 1:13:04.255
Whoa!

1:13:04.339 --> 1:13:05.381
-Babe.
-What the fuck?

1:13:05.465 --> 1:13:06.424
Did you just shoot me?

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.676
Stop shooting your sister!

1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:11.096
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake. I...

1:13:14.641 --> 1:13:16.392
Mom, Dad, apologize to Tom.

1:13:16.476 --> 1:13:18.019
-What? Why?
-What?

1:13:18.103 --> 1:13:20.647
For criticizing this beautiful wedding
that he planned,

1:13:20.730 --> 1:13:23.650
and for never making him
feel welcome in our family.

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:25.735
And for inviting Sean to our wedding.

1:13:25.819 --> 1:13:27.612
Okay, honey, but I think there's

1:13:27.695 --> 1:13:29.280
-a more pressing issue...
-Apologize!

1:13:29.364 --> 1:13:31.407
-He is the best person

1:13:31.491 --> 1:13:32.492
that I know.

1:13:32.575 --> 1:13:34.577
And if you say one more bad thing
about him,

1:13:34.661 --> 1:13:36.996
I swear I will shoot you
like I shot Jamie.

1:13:38.706 --> 1:13:39.707
Tom, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:13:39.791 --> 1:13:41.000
-Tom, sorry. Sorry.
-We love you.

1:13:41.084 --> 1:13:42.168
-Oh, hey, it's fine.
-You're the best person

1:13:42.252 --> 1:13:43.503
-I've ever met.
-It's okay. I love you.

1:13:43.586 --> 1:13:44.838
-We love you like family.
-I love you, too.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.756
-All right. It's all good.
-I love this place. Beautiful.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.091
And, Carol, Larry...

1:13:48.174 --> 1:13:49.467
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1:13:49.551 --> 1:13:53.388
This was more about me and my family,
but we should get lunch sometime.

1:13:53.471 --> 1:13:54.472
-I would...
-Oh, yeah,

1:13:54.556 --> 1:13:55.974
-lunch sounds great. Yeah.
-We love eating.

1:13:56.057 --> 1:13:58.268
It's hard for anyone to live up
to your perfect marriage.

1:13:58.351 --> 1:14:00.436
Who told you
we had a perfect marriage?

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:02.772
Oh, come on, Mom.
You guys fought, like, once.

1:14:02.856 --> 1:14:04.149
It was about who loved the dog more.

1:14:04.232 --> 1:14:06.359
I mean, what is not perfect
about your marriage?

1:14:06.985 --> 1:14:09.988
Well, I made love to your Aunt Marie.

1:14:10.071 --> 1:14:11.322
-What?

1:14:11.406 --> 1:14:12.866
-Yeah.
-Then I went out

1:14:12.949 --> 1:14:14.617
and started doing all this weird sex stuff

1:14:14.701 --> 1:14:15.869
with Jim Roberts.

1:14:15.952 --> 1:14:17.203
Yeah. You and Jim Roberts

1:14:17.287 --> 1:14:19.080
-went on for a couple months.
-Yes.

1:14:19.164 --> 1:14:21.708
-Because our bodies just fit.
-Holy...

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:24.460
In the end,
Jim Roberts just wasn't your dad.

1:14:24.544 --> 1:14:26.796
And Aunt Marie realized
that she had a sex addiction.

1:14:27.463 --> 1:14:30.216
But then you know what? We worked it out.

1:14:33.178 --> 1:14:34.929
These are some incredible breakthroughs,

1:14:35.013 --> 1:14:36.347
-right? I mean...
-Give me that!

1:14:37.515 --> 1:14:38.808
You remember me, huh?

1:14:38.892 --> 1:14:40.852
Look, you burn my face. Huh?

1:14:40.935 --> 1:14:42.478
Yes, I know. I still feel
really bad about that.

1:14:46.024 --> 1:14:47.984
Everybody, in the pool! Now!

1:14:50.361 --> 1:14:52.113
Get in the pool! In!

1:14:52.947 --> 1:14:54.407
Go! Go!

1:14:57.577 --> 1:14:59.204
-Hey, you okay?
-Yes.

1:14:59.287 --> 1:15:00.955
-Yeah?
-Are we missing people?

1:15:01.456 --> 1:15:03.917
Yeah. Turns out
your boy Sean's an asshole.

1:15:05.793 --> 1:15:06.836
We have the bride.

1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:08.546
-Do you copy?

1:15:09.881 --> 1:15:11.341
Do you copy?

1:15:16.888 --> 1:15:18.306
Up! Up!

1:15:18.389 --> 1:15:20.516
-Listen to me. Move.

1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:23.478
Balinese? So these guys are Balinese?

1:15:23.561 --> 1:15:26.397
And Sean is full of shit,
and they took Harriett hostage?

1:15:26.481 --> 1:15:27.523
It doesn't make sense.

1:15:27.607 --> 1:15:29.859
Why would Sean take Harriett hostage
on the helicopter

1:15:29.943 --> 1:15:31.778
when she was already
being held hostage here?

1:15:31.861 --> 1:15:34.405
I don't know. Maybe he wanted
to take her extra hostage.

1:15:34.489 --> 1:15:36.366
I think Harriett is in on it.

1:15:36.824 --> 1:15:39.410
-What?
-What do you mean?

1:15:44.999 --> 1:15:46.918
Harriett and Sean...

1:15:47.961 --> 1:15:49.254
are boyfriend-girlfriend.

1:15:49.337 --> 1:15:50.797
-Oh, come on.
-Boyfriend-girlfriend?

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:52.257
No, no. Look.

1:15:52.924 --> 1:15:54.634
This is from last night.

1:15:54.717 --> 1:15:56.636
Here we go.

1:15:58.137 --> 1:15:59.764
Let's see.

1:15:59.847 --> 1:16:02.684
Uh, hold on. Let me find it.

1:16:03.685 --> 1:16:05.436
Oh. Oh, boy.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.105
Yeah. There you go.

1:16:15.697 --> 1:16:17.740
What? Go ahead. Say it.

1:16:17.824 --> 1:16:18.908
Roberto...

1:16:22.829 --> 1:16:24.539
Lo siento.

1:16:27.041 --> 1:16:28.293
Gracias.

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:30.920
De nada.

1:16:34.882 --> 1:16:36.050
There!

1:16:42.181 --> 1:16:45.476
Sean, you promised
this job would make us rich.

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.770
So far, all it's done
is killed four of my men.

1:16:47.854 --> 1:16:49.272
Man, you know we can fix this.

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:51.941
Deal is off. I keep the money.

1:16:52.025 --> 1:16:54.152
You walk away with your life.

1:16:54.235 --> 1:16:56.779
I don't wanna hear it.
You and I had an arrangement.

1:16:56.863 --> 1:16:59.240
Sean, be reasonable. He saved us.

1:16:59.324 --> 1:17:01.200
-We're lucky to be alive.
-What are you talking about?

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:03.536
Listen to your woman.

1:17:03.619 --> 1:17:05.038
-Oh.

1:17:05.121 --> 1:17:07.749
It's okay. It's just a pressure point.
Relax.

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:10.001
Just breathe into it.

1:17:10.752 --> 1:17:11.878
What?

1:17:13.504 --> 1:17:14.589
What?

1:17:15.089 --> 1:17:16.507
Take us back down.

1:17:16.591 --> 1:17:18.801
We'll finish the job ourselves.

1:17:18.885 --> 1:17:20.428
-Babe.
-What?

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.890
-Excellent idea.
-Yeah, I know.

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:26.517
I have to do everything myself!

1:17:29.312 --> 1:17:31.522
What are we gonna do?
They'll be back any minute.

1:17:31.606 --> 1:17:33.524
-Just...
-Hey, hey, hey!

1:17:34.192 --> 1:17:36.861
No whispers.
Or I throw grenade in the pool.

1:17:42.950 --> 1:17:43.951
Okay.

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:46.996
Go with me, okay?

1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:48.289
Just go with me.

1:17:48.998 --> 1:17:50.333
Hey, everybody.

1:17:51.542 --> 1:17:53.628
Look, I know this may
not be the best time,

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:57.215
but this may be our only chance
to have our wedding.

1:17:59.008 --> 1:18:00.218
What do you say, Darcy?

1:18:01.427 --> 1:18:02.929
Yeah, I... I love it.

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:06.474
Can... Can we do bride's side on the left
and groom's on the right?

1:18:11.562 --> 1:18:13.064
Hey, Margy, will you officiate?

1:18:14.023 --> 1:18:16.317
Hey, will you stop?
Stop it! Stop it now!

1:18:16.401 --> 1:18:17.777
Wait, wait. If...

1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:21.197
If you let my daughter have her wedding,
I'll... I'll release the funds.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:29.580
Okay, let's go.

1:18:36.796 --> 1:18:38.047
Let's go.

1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:40.049
Thanks, Dad.

1:18:40.550 --> 1:18:41.717
It's okay, princess.

1:18:41.801 --> 1:18:43.594
There are some things
that are more important than money.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.973
I don't know what they are,
but I think, uh...

1:19:00.069 --> 1:19:01.654

I'm fairly new to grenades.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:21:00.731
But I'm pretty sure that if you shoot me,
this springy thing pops off,

1:21:00.815 --> 1:21:02.692
and then this thing blows us all away.

-No.

1:21:24.005 --> 1:21:25.464
I can't throw that far.
It won't reach him.

1:21:28.551 --> 1:21:30.636
Nobody fucks with my family.

1:21:43.316 --> 1:21:45.401
Darcy? Give me a meatball.

1:21:45.693 --> 1:21:46.861
-Shit.

1:22:02.918 --> 1:22:04.253
I know where to go!

1:22:04.337 --> 1:22:06.213
Let's get moving! Out of the pool!

1:22:06.297 --> 1:22:07.590

-Margy! The spa!

1:22:14.096 --> 1:22:15.556
It's safe in the spa!

1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:17.850
They should've been
killing hostages every hour.

1:22:17.933 --> 1:22:20.353
Killing people works, Sean.

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:21.979
-Fuck.

You did this for me?

1:24:57.760 --> 1:24:59.094
Is this what you wanted?

1:24:59.178 --> 1:25:00.763
Just you and me
in the middle of the ocean?

1:25:03.599 --> 1:25:06.060
Darcy, I'm sorry
I stopped listening to you.

1:25:06.143 --> 1:25:08.270
I just thought that
if I planned the perfect wedding,

1:25:08.354 --> 1:25:10.272
we could have the perfect marriage, but...

1:25:11.065 --> 1:25:12.441
But that doesn't exist.

1:25:13.067 --> 1:25:14.735
I mean, look at my parents.

1:25:14.819 --> 1:25:16.987
My Aunt Marie, the sex addict.

1:25:18.364 --> 1:25:21.617
I just wanna be with you.
All that matters is you.

1:25:22.368 --> 1:25:23.786
We don't ever have to get married.

1:25:25.496 --> 1:25:27.414
And if we survive this thing,
can we just...

1:25:28.958 --> 1:25:30.209
Can we start over?

1:25:36.173 --> 1:25:37.508
Go, go, go, go.

1:25:37.925 --> 1:25:39.760
Deedee, listen to me!

1:25:40.427 --> 1:25:43.264
Deedee, this is
a huge misunderstanding, all right?

1:25:43.347 --> 1:25:47.768
Let's go back to the resort,
talk this over. I do not want to hurt you.

1:25:47.852 --> 1:25:49.395
Then stop shooting at us, asshole!

1:25:49.478 --> 1:25:51.397
And stop calling her Deedee!

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:53.065
-Fuck!
-Oh, Jesus!

1:25:54.275 --> 1:25:55.734
This thing is awful!

1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:57.903
Yeah!

1:25:58.237 --> 1:26:00.906
Asshole! Fuckin' leave! What the fuck?

1:26:02.491 --> 1:26:05.536
God, I can't believe you, Sean!
When did you turn into such a monster?

1:26:06.161 --> 1:26:07.621
I am not a monster!

1:26:07.705 --> 1:26:09.081
I'm an entrepreneur!

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:10.624
I think I'm out of ammo.

1:26:10.708 --> 1:26:12.084
-Are you sure?
-Not at all.

1:26:12.543 --> 1:26:13.627
Hey.

1:26:18.757 --> 1:26:19.884
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna do this.

1:26:19.967 --> 1:26:21.302
-I'm a good guy, damn it!

1:26:22.970 --> 1:26:24.388
-Shit.

1:26:24.972 --> 1:26:26.390
Your boat's dead.

1:26:26.473 --> 1:26:29.935
We're both out of ammo. Let's just go back
and we can work this whole thing out.

1:26:39.778 --> 1:26:40.988
Tom!

1:26:44.450 --> 1:26:45.534
Go, go!

1:27:21.528 --> 1:27:23.322
Darcy, turn this boat around right now.

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:25.741
No.

1:27:28.452 --> 1:27:31.121
You're a piece of shit, Sean,
but I know you can't kill me.

1:27:31.205 --> 1:27:32.206
You're right.

1:27:32.748 --> 1:27:34.625
But I would love to kill this guy.

1:27:35.125 --> 1:27:37.836
You just keep messing things up, man.
This is on you.

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:40.881
I don't wanna do this. I'm a good guy.

1:27:41.966 --> 1:27:43.300
No, you're not.

1:27:44.093 --> 1:27:46.178
All right, you're right. I'm not.

1:28:00.985 --> 1:28:02.152
Sean!

1:28:08.283 --> 1:28:10.035
You were a pity invite!

1:28:10.119 --> 1:28:11.453
-Shit!

1:28:11.537 --> 1:28:13.288
Whoa! Whoa!

1:28:19.586 --> 1:28:21.380
No! Fuck!

1:28:46.739 --> 1:28:48.574
Is that a wad of loose hair?

1:28:48.657 --> 1:28:50.159
Custom-made hair!

1:29:08.135 --> 1:29:09.094
-Get down!

1:29:14.224 --> 1:29:15.392
Oh, frick.

1:29:23.859 --> 1:29:24.860
Hold on.

1:29:30.699 --> 1:29:32.534
Oh, shit.

1:29:47.424 --> 1:29:48.801
Holy shit.

1:30:23.001 --> 1:30:24.711
So when I asked you before

1:30:26.296 --> 1:30:27.506
if we could start over...

1:30:30.342 --> 1:30:31.885
I don't wanna start over.

1:30:43.230 --> 1:30:44.815
I wanna keep going.

1:30:59.288 --> 1:31:00.747
Tom Fowler,

1:31:01.790 --> 1:31:03.250
will you marry me?

1:31:09.798 --> 1:31:11.008
Are you sure?

1:31:12.926 --> 1:31:14.052
You're not scared?

1:31:16.013 --> 1:31:17.890
I'm terrified.

1:31:19.141 --> 1:31:21.977
Life is always gonna be chaotic.

1:31:23.937 --> 1:31:25.689
But what I know for sure...

1:31:27.482 --> 1:31:30.152
is that I wanna go through
all of it with you.

1:31:32.905 --> 1:31:34.948
It's simple, really.

1:31:37.075 --> 1:31:38.702
Just a plan with one step.

1:31:48.462 --> 1:31:49.546
Still fits.

1:32:09.650 --> 1:32:11.443
Stop. Be quiet.

1:32:35.884 --> 1:32:38.095
Shit! Sorry! Sorry!

1:32:38.178 --> 1:32:39.846
There was one firework left

1:32:39.930 --> 1:32:41.974
and I thought it would be fun,
and beautiful, and poignant,

1:32:42.057 --> 1:32:43.684
-but it was absolutely not!
