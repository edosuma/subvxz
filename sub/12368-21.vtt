08:43.688 --> 08:44.732
- DING-DONG.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.400
- WHO COULD THAT BE?

08:46.484 --> 08:49.862
- ELKA! ELKA!
- [laughs]

08:49.946 --> 08:51.948
THERE'LL BE A LONG WEEK
THERE WHILE YOU GET

08:52.031 --> 08:54.408
A LOT OF OPEN ARMS.
[laughs]

08:54.492 --> 08:56.786
both: YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.954
[laughter]

08:58.037 --> 09:00.790
- TV LAND IS FOR TV WATCHERS,

09:00.873 --> 09:03.459
SO TV WATCHERS,
MORE THAN ANYTHING, APPRECIATE

09:03.543 --> 09:06.462
ALL THESE GREAT ICONS
OF THE LAST 30 TO 40 YEARS

09:06.545 --> 09:08.631
OF TELEVISION.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.632
- [gasps]

09:09.715 --> 09:11.467
- HELLO, VICTORIA.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.011
- OH, LUCCI.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.471
- HEY, YOU TWO.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.683
HOW MANY LESBIANS DOES IT TAKE
TO MAKE ME A SANDWICH?

09:18.766 --> 09:22.144
- I THINK WE MUST HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD REPUTATION

09:22.228 --> 09:25.064
AMONGST OUR GUEST STARS BECAUSE
WE--WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE

09:25.147 --> 09:27.149
ANY TROUBLE GETTING
GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.151
- IT'S SO TINY.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.653
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT THE BEST
THING TO SAY TO A MAN

09:30.736 --> 09:33.197
WHO JUST TOOK OFF HIS PANTS.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.367
- I ADORE GEORGIA ENGEL SO MUCH

09:36.450 --> 09:38.703
ON <i> THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.</i>

09:38.786 --> 09:41.747
AND SHE CAME IN,
AND SHE WAS JUST WONDERFUL.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.126
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
WE COULD READ THEM OUR PLAY.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.669
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.630
- DAMN! GEORGIA,
I WISH YOU'D GET IT RIGHT!

09:49.714 --> 09:52.967
[laughter]

09:53.050 --> 09:56.053
- WE HAVE HAD JUST SO MANY OLD
FRIENDS AND GREAT PEOPLE.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.472
YOU KNOW, JOHN MAHONEY
WHO I WAS MARRIED TO ON <i> FRASIER</i>

09:58.556 --> 10:00.474
WHEN I WAS JANE'S MOTHER-IN-LAW.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.518
SHE LOVES TO TELL PEOPLE THAT.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.730
AND JON LOVITZ WHO IS ONE
OF THE FUNNIEST HUMAN BEINGS

10:05.813 --> 10:07.481
I'VE EVER WORKED WITH.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.984
- IF I ONLY COULD DANCE
MY WAY INTO HER HEART

10:10.067 --> 10:12.028
AND SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.237
[dramatically]
BUT ALAS,

10:13.321 --> 10:17.116
I CAN NEITHER DANCE NOR SWEEP.

10:17.199 --> 10:22.204
[laughter]

10:22.288 --> 10:25.875
- ONE OF THE FUN THINGS
IS THE COMFORT OF KNOWING

10:25.958 --> 10:29.086
IT'S OKAY TO SCREW UP
BECAUSE YOU JUST TAKE IT AGAIN.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.340
WOULD YOU MIND?

10:32.423 --> 10:35.760
AND OUT OF THOSE MOMENTS
OF SCREWING UP,

10:35.843 --> 10:38.220
COME THESE BRILLIANT
LAUGHING FITS

10:38.304 --> 10:42.558
THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN OUT OF
PURE MISTAKES AND PURE IMPROV.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.018
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU WON'T CLAP FOR ME?

10:44.101 --> 10:44.977
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.396
I CAN GIVE A TERRIFIC SALUTE.
[taps foot]

10:47.480 --> 10:49.106
DOUBLE-FINGER GUNS WITH
A BOOP-BOOP-BOOP--

10:49.190 --> 10:52.693
[laughter]

10:52.777 --> 10:55.237
- UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY THING
HORNY ABOUT MOSES

10:55.321 --> 10:56.572
IS HIS FACE.

10:56.655 --> 11:00.701
- [laughing]

11:03.496 --> 11:08.417
[snorting laughter]

11:08.501 --> 11:10.294
- [laughs]
- IT'S GOT TO COME DOWN.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.670
- HERE?

11:15.674 --> 11:18.427
- WHERE ARE YOUR BOOBS?
CALL SECURITY!

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
[cheers and applause]

11:20.388 --> 11:21.931
THEY'LL FIND THEM.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.558
EVERYONE, CHECK
UNDER THE TABLES.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.394
[laughter]

11:31.982 --> 11:32.608
{\an8}[cart beeping]

11:32.692 --> 11:36.445
{\an8}- WHOO-HOO.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.947
{\an8}- THANK YOU, HONEY.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.741
{\an8}- [laughs]
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.159
- SO HERE WE ARE,
IT'S SHOW DAY,

11:42.243 --> 11:45.663
AND I'M ON MY WAY TO WORK
IN MY LITTLE CART.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.623
WE'RE PROBABLY
ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY

11:47.706 --> 11:48.833
BEFORE I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE ONSTAGE.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.419
I LOVE THE STUDIO.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.671
THE CONVENIENCE,
THE NICE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.465
YEAH, I GOT IT GOOD.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.302
THANKS.
[giggles]

12:00.386 --> 12:02.930
HERE WE ARE
ON THE CBS RADFORD LOT.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.100
OOPS, SORRY.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.269
[whispers] I SHOULD LEARN
HOW TO SLOW DOWN.

12:08.352 --> 12:13.441
AND WE ARE, RIGHT IN FRONT
OF MELANIE'S DRESSING ROOM.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.735
MY SECOND HOME.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
- YOU THOUGHT WE WERE ALL
NATURAL BEAUTIES, DIDN'T YOU?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.619
- NO, I THINK I'VE BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH NOW.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.163
- I KNOW.
- [laughs]

12:27.246 --> 12:29.165
- WHEN WE GET TO SHOW DAY,

12:29.248 --> 12:30.708
IT'S REALLY FUN

12:30.791 --> 12:33.169
BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE REALLY
IS THE FINISHING TOUCH.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.503
- HI.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.796
- I WOULD COMPARE IT TO SPORTS.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.007
YOU KNOW,
YOU PRACTICE ALL WEEK LONG,

12:38.090 --> 12:41.510
YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU PUT
YOUR UNIFORM ON,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.512
THE CROWD'S THERE,
AND IT'S GAME NIGHT.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.805
[knocking on door]
- YES?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.015
- WENDIE,
WE'RE READY FOR YOU ONSTAGE.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.683
- OH, ALREADY?
- YES.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.185
- THAT'S NICE.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.563
ON AUDIENCE NIGHT, YOU JUST
CAN FEEL THE BUTTERFLIES.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.316
OH, MY FAMILY'S HERE TONIGHT.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.651
WE HAVE MICHAEL BURGER UP THERE
WARMING UP THE AUDIENCE.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.361
- ANYBODY HERE
FROM NORTH DAKOTA?

12:59.445 --> 13:00.529
NORTH DAKOTA?
- HEY!

13:00.613 --> 13:02.364
- REALLY? DUMBEST STATE I'VE
EVER BEEN IN IN MY LIFE.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.407
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.159
GIVE ME
A LITTLE SOMETHING THERE.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.577
MAYBE IT WAS ME.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.745
I'M IN NORTH DAKOTA,
I PULL INTO THE SERVICE STATION,

13:07.828 --> 13:09.205
I SAY, "HOW DO YOU GET
TO SOUTH DAKOTA?"

13:09.288 --> 13:11.540
THE GUY LOOKS AT ME AND GOES,
"MY BROTHER TAKES ME."

13:11.624 --> 13:14.210
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]

13:14.293 --> 13:16.337
- THEY MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE,
THE AUDIENCE.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.840
THEY COME IN, READY TO LAUGH,
READY TO ENJOY.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.425
- I GET NERVOUS ON SHOW NIGHT.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.054
- I THINK--BUT I THINK IT'S
THE ADRENALINE THAT KICKS IN.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.722
IT'S JUST LIKE
BEING IN THE THEATER,

13:26.805 --> 13:29.058
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
THAT WE ALL KIND OF LIVE FOR.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.893
- YOU CAN JUST CLEAN UP AFTER.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.230
- I HAVE TO FAINT AT LEAST
THREE TIMES BEFORE SHOWTIME.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.690
- ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I'M GOING
TO BE HIS WIFE.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.734
- OH, MY GOD.
- I GIVE IT TWO MONTHS.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.237
- HE'S GOT THREE MONTHS TO LIVE.
- I KNOW.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.697
- ALL RIGHTY.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.199
- SHALL YOU MEET THIS CAST HERE,
<i>HOT IN CLEVELAND?</i>

13:45.282 --> 13:46.408
ARE YOU READY?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.077
[cheers and applause]

13:48.160 --> 13:49.745
- OKAY, SHOWTIME.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.748
- LET'S SPRINT.

13:52.831 --> 13:53.916
ONCE THE AUDIENCE COMES IN,

13:53.999 --> 13:55.751
YOU SORT OF RELY ON
THAT A LITTLE BIT

13:55.834 --> 13:57.878
BECAUSE EVERYTHING BECOMES
BIGGER AND LOUDER

13:57.962 --> 14:00.714
AND REALLY BUOYS
YOUR PERFORMANCE UP.

14:00.798 --> 14:05.594
[cheers and applause]

14:05.678 --> 14:07.596
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
FOR BEING HERE.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.764
YOU'RE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART
OF OUR SHOW

14:08.847 --> 14:11.392
BECAUSE YOU ARE OUR LAUGHTER,
SO WHAT YOU FIND FUNNY,

14:11.475 --> 14:13.435
AND WHEN YOU LAUGH,
IT GETS RECORDED,

14:13.519 --> 14:14.770
AND THEN THAT'S
WHAT YOU HEAR ON TV.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.230
SO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.607
AND HAVE A GREAT TIME.
HERE WE GO.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.069
[cheers and applause]

14:22.152 --> 14:24.572
- WE HAVE A LITTLE HUDDLE
THAT JUST GOES ON.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.283
IT'S LIKE ONE FOR ALL
AND ALL FOR ONE.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.119
AND THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE
OF JOKES THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.120
[giggles]

14:31.203 --> 14:34.832
AND THEN--BUT THAT
JUST GETS US ALL TOGETHER

14:34.915 --> 14:37.293
BEFORE WE GO OUT
AND DO THE SHOW.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.460
[bell ringing]

14:38.544 --> 14:40.796
- WHEN PEOPLE COME
AND JOIN THE AUDIENCE,

14:40.879 --> 14:43.424
THEY'RE STUNNED THAT
IT DOESN'T TAKE A HALF AN HOUR.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.509
IT'S LIKE, WHY DOES IT TAKE
THREE OR FOUR HOURS?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.304
[indistinct chatter]

14:48.387 --> 14:50.431
- FROM THE TOP.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:50.514 --> 14:51.432
[laughter]

14:51.515 --> 14:55.394
[cheerful music]

14:55.477 --> 14:57.438
- YOU'RE DOING A GOOD THING,
JOY.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.108
I MEAN, HAVING YOU FOR A WIFE
WILL MAKE DYING A LOT EASIER.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.192
[laughter]

15:02.276 --> 15:03.819
[doorbell rings]
I'M AN ENIGMA,

15:03.902 --> 15:06.530
WRAPPED INSIDE A CONUNDRUM,

15:06.614 --> 15:07.948
SHROUDED IN DIMPLES.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.658
[laughter]

15:09.742 --> 15:12.119
[cheers and applause]

15:12.202 --> 15:15.164
- JOAN RIVERS, EVERYBODY!

15:15.247 --> 15:18.167
[cheers and applause]

15:18.250 --> 15:20.669
- THE WORST FEELING IS WHEN
NOBODY'S SAYING THEIR LINES

15:20.753 --> 15:22.129
AND YOU'RE WONDERING,
DO I HAVE A LINE HERE?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.756
- IS IT ME?
- IS IT MY LINE?

15:23.839 --> 15:25.341
- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.384
IT'S THE HEART OF SHOW BUSINESS.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.136
- A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SAY

15:29.219 --> 15:30.679
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE THINGS
ABOUT COMING TO A TAPING

15:30.763 --> 15:32.348
IS WHEN WE SCREW UP

15:32.431 --> 15:36.518
BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE
FOR THE REAL THING, YOU KNOW?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.187
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
WE SCREW UP QUITE A BIT,

15:38.270 --> 15:40.564
SO WE HAVE A LOT FOR THEM
TO APPRECIATE.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.816
NOW WE ARE FOUR
INTELLIGENT WOMEN.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.401
- HMM.
- I'M SURE THAT WE CAN--

15:44.485 --> 15:45.986
- [laughs]

15:46.070 --> 15:47.363
- I'M SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP
WITH SOMETHING--

15:47.446 --> 15:49.740
[laughing]

15:49.823 --> 15:52.576
WE HAD A LITTLE MOMENT.
UNEXPECTED MOMENT.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.912
- [screams]

15:54.995 --> 15:57.956
- IS VICTORIA TRYING
TO IRON AGAIN?

15:58.040 --> 16:02.711
- SHE'S REAT--
WHY CAN'T I SPEAK TODAY?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.880
- [British accent]
BECAUSE YOU'RE BRITISH.

16:04.963 --> 16:08.717
- THAT'S--
[laughing]

16:08.801 --> 16:12.346
- IT'S DELIGHTFULLY
WELL-WRITTEN, AND IT'S PUNCHY.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.057
- [laughs]

16:15.140 --> 16:16.725
- IT'S DELIGHTFULLY
WELL-WRITTEN,

16:16.809 --> 16:18.060
AND WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.478
- IT WAS AN HONOR
AND A PRIVILEGE

16:19.561 --> 16:20.562
TO BE HER LIVE-IN NURSE.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.774
- MURDERER!

16:23.857 --> 16:26.235
- [indistinct]
SHOT HERE.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.569
FROM THERE WE'RE GOING
TO GO FROM "MURDERER."

16:27.653 --> 16:28.570
- [screams]
WHAT?

16:28.654 --> 16:34.743
[laughter]

16:34.827 --> 16:36.286
- AND I'LL PRETEND
TO FLY TO HOLLYWOOD,

16:36.370 --> 16:38.622
AND THEN HE'LL LEAVE
AND TAKE THIS UNLOVABLE,

16:38.706 --> 16:41.417
ANNOYING MONSTER WITH HIM.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.002
- [bleep] YOU.
- WHAT?

16:44.086 --> 16:47.423
YOU KNOW WHAT.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.552
[audience exclaims]

16:51.635 --> 16:54.096
- I LOVE WHEN WE
GET TO BE SILLY,

16:54.179 --> 16:55.556
WHICH WE DO QUITE
A BIT ON THIS SHOW.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.224
IT'S FUN.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.226
IT'S FUN FOR US,
AND IT'S FUN FOR THE AUDIENCE

16:59.309 --> 17:01.437
TO SEE US ABSOLUTELY FALL
TO PIECES LAUGHING.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.771
- AND ACTION.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.315
- WHY DO I SMELL BANANAS?

17:05.398 --> 17:07.443
- OH, I LIT MY MONKEY CANDLE.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.488
- BUT A MONKEY DOESN'T SMELL
LIKE BANANAS.

17:11.571 --> 17:15.075
- DO YOU WANT IT TO SMELL
LIKE BURNING MONKEYS?

17:15.159 --> 17:16.743
[laughter]

17:16.827 --> 17:20.289
- BUT A MONKEY DOESN'T
SMELL LIKE A BANANA.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.292
[laughter]

17:24.376 --> 17:27.128
- TELL ME, DO YOU WANT IT
TO SMELL LIKE A BURNING MONKEY?

17:27.212 --> 17:30.424
[laughter]

17:30.507 --> 17:31.300
- OKAY.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.511
- I THINK--I THINK WE GOT IT.
- WHAT?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.640
[audience laughter]

17:38.724 --> 17:39.725
- WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

17:39.808 --> 17:41.143
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE ASKS IF I
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.936
- WELL, TELL HER YOU DO.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.107
- WHO WOULD I GET TO PRETEND
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

17:49.735 --> 17:53.113
[laughter]

17:55.574 --> 18:01.371
[laughter]

18:02.915 --> 18:06.543
[laughter and applause]

18:06.627 --> 18:08.504
- AND CUT.
[applause]

18:08.587 --> 18:11.298
- WHAT'S NICE OVER TIME
IS GETTING TO KNOW EVERYBODY

18:11.381 --> 18:14.176
THAT YOU WORK WITH, AND BY NOW,
SEASON THREE,

18:14.259 --> 18:16.470

18:19.264 --> 18:23.644
THE GREATEST WEEK WE CAN
POSSIBLY MAKE IT.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.895
- WE STARTED OUR COMPANY
SAYING THAT

18:24.978 --> 18:26.021
WE DIDN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH ANYBODY.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.022
THAT WASN'T HAVING FUN,

18:27.105 --> 18:28.857
AND THESE PEOPLE CAME IN
HAVING A LOT OF FUN.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.902
AND WE JUST GOT
TO BE A PART OF IT.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.488
- WE'VE BEEN ON NOW FOR--
THIS IS OUR THIRD SEASON.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.448
AND WE LITERALLY MISS EACH OTHER

18:36.532 --> 18:38.534
WHEN WE'RE OFF
FOR A WEEK'S HIATUS.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.079
AND NONE OF THAT IS FORCED.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.914
- WE REALLY LIKE IT WHEN IT'S A
SCENE WITH JUST THE FOUR OF US.

18:43.997 --> 18:47.376
AND WE GET DOWN TO, YOU KNOW,
US AND THE HEART.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.336
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN
HOLD OUT TILL THE 12th DATE.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.838
I NEVER COULD.

- LIKE YOU EVER HAD A 12th DATE.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.010
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT
DRIED-UP OLD THING?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.221

18:59.304 --> 19:03.725
- I WAS TALKING
TO THE BOUQUET.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.728
- BUT IT'S MY MAGIC DRESS.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.188

THAT WILL LISTEN

19:37.301 --> 19:41.263
THAT I WORK ON THE HAPPIEST SET
I'VE EVER WORKED ON

19:41.346 --> 19:44.892
IN 63 YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.769
BUT YOU ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.313

19:49.396 --> 19:51.106

EACH OTHER'S BACKS,
