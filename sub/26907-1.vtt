Yo, Murray!

00:47.781 --> 00:49.493
You got small ones.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.660
Eh!

00:50.684 --> 00:52.686
Not the first time
I've heard that.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.324
Hey, that beer ain't free.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.936
How about offering twofers in
celebration of the last night?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.271
Like hell.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.407
I'm doubling the price.
Fund my retirement.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.441
- Good luck with that.
- Hm.

01:05.465 --> 01:10.338
Damn. And I was hoping to
put flames on my Winnebago.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.518
Hard to believe this is it.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.786
I'm tired, Hutch.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.988
Tired of the government telling
me how to run my business.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.458
Tired of this bar being
empty every night.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.750
I'm always here.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.763

autograph these,

01:37.131 --> 01:40.310

say anything about snow.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.214

from freezing.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.084
How about you, Jack? You

bad boys right now?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.157
Right now. Murray and I
will be your witnesses.

02:27.181 --> 02:30.994
No. My paralegal cousin asked
me not to sign anything

02:31.018 --> 02:33.630
until he had a chance
to look over them.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.998

God! I mean, it's
freezing out here!

04:24.532 --> 04:25.942
It's a simple question!

04:25.966 --> 04:28.177
Why didn't you tell me that
it was gonna be snowing?

04:28.201 --> 04:30.447
I am not dressed for this shit!

04:30.471 --> 04:33.583
God, I am so tired of being the

05:03.203 --> 05:05.673
Okay, well can you

Aw, relax, babe.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.851
What can I get you, comrade?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.621
Beer. Uh, something in a bottle.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.623
Mother/son issues,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.291
severe maturity avoidance,

05:48.315 --> 05:50.193
and an irrational
fear of abandonment,

05:50.217 --> 05:53.363
which is exactly why you drag
me on these bullshit trips.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.732

just last week.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.433

06:32.092 --> 06:33.703
Folks around here call me Hutch.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.605

- DR?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.108

- Uh-oh.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.949
Yeah.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.150
You're a lucky man.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.042

07:20.474 --> 07:22.018
This is their
six-month anniversary

07:22.042 --> 07:23.520

to stare at each other

07:25.513 --> 07:27.491

07:27.515 --> 07:30.860
She read in Cosmo somewhere that
they need to keep it fresh.

07:30.884 --> 07:34.363

In my bedroom, on my bed.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.428
Lis is growing up thinking
this is how men act.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.931
You gotta fix that, Roxie.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.767

over for a change.

No.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.410

Neil, but it's important to me.

mean, what do you think?

I would be betraying her.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.689
Wait. Let me get this straight.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.859
Saying I'm prettier

Self-reliant.

And I took on all
the thorny issues.

36:08.900 --> 36:13.080
Sold the church's
position with vigor.

Traditional families.

No gays.

Certainly no impure actions.

- Your demon?
- No! The Pope!

36:47.939 --> 36:49.651
See, now that dude? I like him.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.843
Of course you do!
Everybody does!

36:52.711 --> 36:54.212
But he's messing it all up...

36:55.180 --> 36:58.493
with all of that...
accept everyone...

36:58.517 --> 37:02.087
and love everyone.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.661
It goes against everything
I've ever been taught.

37:11.663 --> 37:15.009
Tell me, Father. About how many
of these altar boys you done...

37:15.033 --> 37:16.911
Blow it out your ass!

37:16.935 --> 37:20.114
Good for you, Father.

37:20.138 --> 37:25.043
So... how did you end up...
here?

37:26.778 --> 37:33.027
I was about to deliver my sermon last...
Sunday...

37:33.051 --> 37:34.820
and...

37:36.655 --> 37:38.524
I realized that...

37:41.393 --> 37:43.529
I didn't know what to say.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.532
And...

37:48.367 --> 37:49.901
How...

37:51.537 --> 37:54.516
So I got in my car...

37:54.540 --> 37:56.451
and...

37:56.475 --> 37:58.577
drove for two days.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.725
And I feel I should
keep driving...

38:03.749 --> 38:06.328
until God shows me the answer.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.587
♪

38:09.855 --> 38:11.256
How do you know...

38:12.223 --> 38:15.069
that your answer
isn't right here?

38:15.093 --> 38:16.504
Maybe...

38:16.528 --> 38:19.130
Maybe this is exactly...

38:19.931 --> 38:22.934
where your God wants you to be.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.642
You've got to be
frigging kidding me.

38:31.577 --> 38:32.654
Honey.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.622
Sweetie, are you finished
with your theological tag

38:34.646 --> 38:36.658
with the schizophrenic
priest here?

38:36.682 --> 38:38.393
I really wanna get out of here.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.387
Sweetness... we can't leave.

38:42.488 --> 38:46.033
I forgot the chains
for the motorcycle.

38:46.057 --> 38:49.337
Typical! I have to
remember everything!

38:49.361 --> 38:52.364
As always, I'm truly sorry.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.078
Ladies room, please?

38:57.102 --> 38:58.413
I wouldn't know.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.114
You're the first lady
we've had in here.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.749
- Aw.
- All right, all right.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.259
Looks in order.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.785
At least for you.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.622
What do you mean
at least for me?

39:18.289 --> 39:20.258
Your ex is getting
the shaft, you know?

39:21.660 --> 39:23.395
Isn't that the point?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.973
Why does he only get
to see your daughter

39:25.997 --> 39:27.032
every other Sunday?

39:28.233 --> 39:30.745
Because I'm the mom and
he's the douche-nozzle.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.605
Doesn't matter. She's
still his family.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.019
His family he
conveniently forgets

39:38.043 --> 39:40.955
every time he feels
like screwing around.

39:40.979 --> 39:44.249
So, I'm guessing we really
don't matter that much.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.229
It would kill me...

39:48.253 --> 39:50.865
to only see my kids
every other weekend.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.624
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.918
Hey DR!

40:10.942 --> 40:12.454
You gonna purge the demon,
make up with your girl,

40:12.478 --> 40:13.521
or get back to the game?

40:13.545 --> 40:17.048
Hey, you touch my balls,
I'll break your stick.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.127
That was uncalled for.

40:22.921 --> 40:23.921
Ooh!

40:34.032 --> 40:36.110
You know I'm trying, right babe?

40:36.134 --> 40:37.044
Have you even bothered

40:37.068 --> 40:39.146
calling that therapist
I asked you to do?

40:39.170 --> 40:40.281
Not exactly.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.916
How do you expect to be on
my plane of understanding

40:41.940 --> 40:43.284
if you won't get counseling?

40:43.308 --> 40:46.153
My plane of understanding
is flying as level as ever.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.522
Oh God, DR.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.156
How many times do I
have to tell you,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.917
we are all blind
to our own issues?

40:53.552 --> 40:55.997
Is this your passive aggressive
way of ending our relationship?

40:56.021 --> 40:57.164
No! I just want to go back

40:57.188 --> 40:59.300
to when passive aggressive
was our favorite position.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.536
And I just want you
to catch up to me!

41:01.560 --> 41:03.004
To mature with me!

41:03.028 --> 41:04.872
And to get me out of
this shit hole of a bar!

41:04.896 --> 41:07.198
Babe, if I can be
honest with you...

41:08.500 --> 41:11.112
I think I'm about as caught
up as I'm ever gonna get.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.647
And we ain't going anywhere.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.506
We're stuck here in this storm.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.142
Fine.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.821
If you won't take me home,

41:19.845 --> 41:22.080
I will find someone that will.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.434
You ever do anything
dumb for love?

41:33.458 --> 41:34.459
Not yet.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.804
But the night is still young.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.164
♪

41:39.731 --> 41:41.175
Hi.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.568
I'm Autumn.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.277
It's a shame about
this storm, isn't it?

41:53.945 --> 41:56.591
You know, when it gets cold
like this, my nipples...

41:56.615 --> 41:57.992
With all due respect,

41:58.016 --> 42:01.052
do I look like I need
another slut in my life?

42:09.427 --> 42:11.496
Mind if I bother you, Father?

42:12.931 --> 42:14.232
Sit.

42:18.637 --> 42:21.115
If there are any
demons inside me...

42:21.139 --> 42:24.919
they've surely
passed out by now.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.316
My mother was a
God-loving woman.

42:33.018 --> 42:34.629
Prayed all the time.

42:34.653 --> 42:38.132
Like she and God were
on a first name basis.

42:38.156 --> 42:40.191
"Well, God," she'd say...

42:41.259 --> 42:43.161
"What should I make for dinner?"

42:44.863 --> 42:46.473
Or, "Hey, God..."

42:46.497 --> 42:49.167
what's good on TV?"

42:53.104 --> 42:54.372
Past tense?

42:56.107 --> 42:57.342
She died today.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.947
I guess... technically
yesterday.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.216
I'm sorry.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.329
She had a massive stroke.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.169
I gave God...

43:15.193 --> 43:19.140
one month to speak
on her behalf.

43:19.164 --> 43:23.110
To say something, one
little thing, anything,

43:23.134 --> 43:25.570
that she was still in there.

43:27.538 --> 43:28.740
But nothing.

43:32.778 --> 43:35.180
She had a living
will that said...

43:36.815 --> 43:39.084
she didn't want
to be kept alive.

43:40.485 --> 43:42.429
Sounds like she knew
what she wanted.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.198
She did.

43:44.222 --> 43:45.724
So...

43:47.993 --> 43:49.761
one month to the day...

43:53.564 --> 43:55.266
I made the decision.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.975
And now your sister blames you.

44:05.977 --> 44:09.014
She knows it's what Mama wanted.

44:10.248 --> 44:14.996
She's just looking for one
more crime to pin on me.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.665
But I did the right thing.
I know I did.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.867
Didn't I? I know I did.

44:19.891 --> 44:22.236
Why did God do that?

44:22.260 --> 44:25.106
Why didn't He say
anything to me?

44:25.130 --> 44:26.573
Why didn't He talk?

44:26.597 --> 44:28.900
It's okay. It's okay.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.404
You know what I think?

44:36.574 --> 44:38.786
I think your mama...

44:38.810 --> 44:42.881
went straight to heaven...
a month ago.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.696
And she's been looking
at you ever since...

44:48.720 --> 44:52.423
and wondering...

44:53.925 --> 44:56.494
what are you so
afraid of down here?

44:59.630 --> 45:02.100
I bet if she were here...

45:03.501 --> 45:06.147
your mama would tell you...

45:06.171 --> 45:08.774
to go find yourself
some happiness.

45:18.183 --> 45:20.986
And stop worrying
about everybody else.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.956
Yeah.

45:28.359 --> 45:29.928
You know what, Father?

45:30.862 --> 45:33.164
You're not so
possessed after all.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.610
- Oh!
- Whoops!

45:36.634 --> 45:37.879
The hell's going on, Murr?

45:37.903 --> 45:39.280
I...

45:39.304 --> 45:41.983
I might have scheduled the
power to be turned off.

45:43.608 --> 45:46.387
I was expecting to
close at eight!

45:46.411 --> 45:47.789
You got a flashlight?

45:47.813 --> 45:48.923
[Roxanne] They're
probably packed.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.792
All right, everybody!
Back to the boxes!

45:50.816 --> 45:52.794
- Oh, jeez. Come on.
- Great!

45:52.818 --> 45:55.329
- Ow! God damnit!
- Sorry! Sorry!

45:55.353 --> 45:56.597
- This is ridiculous.
- Be careful!

45:56.621 --> 45:59.801
I've got a lamp down
here somewhere.

45:59.825 --> 46:03.470
Hey! I think I found some
more chocolate churros!

46:03.494 --> 46:05.339
Hey! Put those away!

46:05.363 --> 46:06.774
I mean that! I'm serious!

46:06.798 --> 46:08.442
I'm not eating them!

46:08.466 --> 46:10.377
I found something
that has a switch!

46:10.401 --> 46:11.879
Ho-ho-ho!

46:13.604 --> 46:15.116
Keep that away from me!

46:18.176 --> 46:19.320
Come on, come on! Put it...

46:20.846 --> 46:23.248
- There we go.
- God damnit!

46:25.516 --> 46:27.528
Have you been
eavesdropping again?

46:27.552 --> 46:29.964
Fuck no. I have super
Marine hearing.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.598
Of course you do.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.135
Just one question. Why even
get a fucking divorce?

46:34.159 --> 46:37.038
Just let me pop a
cap in his ass.

46:37.062 --> 46:40.207
You know, I'm stunned they
let you play with guns.

46:40.231 --> 46:41.442
It's easy.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.544
Bam-bam. Two to the head.

46:43.568 --> 46:46.713
And you would do that
for little old me?

46:46.737 --> 46:48.349
It'll cost you.

46:48.373 --> 46:50.484
And let me guess, you
don't want money.

46:50.508 --> 46:53.187
Oh, seven minutes
in heaven, baby.

46:53.211 --> 46:54.712
Win-win.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.158
See, with my luck,

46:57.182 --> 46:59.526
you'd give me the herps, and
you'd put him in a coma

46:59.550 --> 47:02.563
so I'd have to spend the next
50 years wiping his ass.

47:02.587 --> 47:03.630
So, no thanks.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.257
I'll take my chances
with divorce.

47:14.532 --> 47:15.742
Listen.

47:15.766 --> 47:18.436
This blizzard has
everyone on edge.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.784
I was in the ladies
room and, hey...

47:23.808 --> 47:25.887
that counter is still there.

47:25.911 --> 47:27.378
Sturdy as ever.

47:30.148 --> 47:33.218
Look, I can't risk this.

47:34.785 --> 47:37.531
I may not be sure
about my wife, but...

47:37.555 --> 47:39.457
I love my kids.

47:41.726 --> 47:43.995
Come on, it doesn't
have to be a big deal.

47:45.563 --> 47:47.498
I'm trying to say sorry.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.902
I'm sorry too.

47:52.337 --> 47:53.571
Thank you.

47:54.439 --> 47:57.242
Sorry I ever fell
for your flirting.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.817
Thing is, comrade...

48:07.452 --> 48:08.829
after a year,

48:08.853 --> 48:12.233
the second wife sounds
exactly like the first.

48:12.257 --> 48:13.858
Yeah.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.574
Excuse me everyone!

48:20.598 --> 48:21.799
Everyone!

48:24.135 --> 48:26.647
It's now two AM and the
bar is officially closed.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.582
- Yay!
- No, no, no.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.484
Although I'm sure
Murray's gonna stay open

48:30.508 --> 48:31.752
until the plow comes.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.687
Yeah, screw that! Everyone out!

48:35.880 --> 48:39.317
I'd like to offer one last
toast to Murray's karaoke bar!

48:40.685 --> 48:42.053
To Murray.

48:43.521 --> 48:44.966
May life in the sun

48:44.990 --> 48:47.701
offer you slightly less
angst than this place.

48:47.725 --> 48:50.037
Oh, hear, hear.
- I'll drink to that.

48:52.463 --> 48:54.575
- Speech!
- Speech!

48:54.599 --> 48:55.977
Let's hear it, you old fuck!

48:56.001 --> 48:57.478
- Speech! Speech!
- Oh, jeez, no.

48:57.502 --> 49:00.847
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

49:00.871 --> 49:02.283
Most of you I don't even know

49:02.307 --> 49:05.452
and to be honest, I don't
ever care to know!

49:05.476 --> 49:08.289
Especially Autumn here. Talks more
than my last two wives combined.

49:11.616 --> 49:15.729
For those of you I do know...
like, uh, like Hutch here.

49:15.753 --> 49:20.301
I've tried to get rid of...
since day one, and...

49:20.325 --> 49:23.804
And Roxy, who started working
here when she was what?

49:23.828 --> 49:25.096
19?

49:25.730 --> 49:28.342
- 20.
- 20.

49:28.366 --> 49:30.511
Should have quit on
the day you started.

49:33.204 --> 49:36.917
Oh, maybe I'll think of you...
down the road.

49:36.941 --> 49:39.244
Yeah.

49:40.345 --> 49:41.846
But...

49:45.083 --> 49:49.163
Look, there's someone here
tonight I've known since...

49:49.187 --> 49:53.400
since third grade. Someone who's
always been there for me.

49:53.424 --> 49:55.169
Until I fucked everything up.

49:58.863 --> 50:03.177
Oh, Bennett, I'm a... I'm
a card-carrying asshole.

50:03.201 --> 50:05.470
I should have stayed
away from her.

50:07.405 --> 50:09.474
I'll take that
regret to my grave.

50:11.376 --> 50:13.044
I hope someday
you'll forgive me.

50:17.815 --> 50:19.660
Oh...

50:19.684 --> 50:21.028
What the hell?

50:21.052 --> 50:23.764
Drinks on the house 'til
the plows come home!

50:26.124 --> 50:28.702
Everything except my Jameson!

50:33.431 --> 50:35.276
I can sing the woman's part,
'cause I can harmonize.

50:35.300 --> 50:36.777

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.674
We got plenty of time.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.610
You know, you really
are a cold lady,

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:53.279
shutting your sister out
when she's this vulnerable?

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.648
Her hiding it clearly shows
that she is not ready

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.683
for the responsibility
of her first child.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.486
It's not her first.
It's her third.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.056
And the last one
came in 45 minutes.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.125
You deceitful slut!

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:07.527
- Shut up!
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:10.663
Roxy! 911. It's worth a shot.

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:11.664
I'm on it.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:13.299
Hey, hey! Come here, come here.
Look.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:15.059
Your sister's got issues.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.113
Hell, she's got an
entire subscription.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.573
Right now, right now...

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.308
we just need to get that
baby out of her safely.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.010
Okay? All right?

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:25.378
We'll get her through this,

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:26.847
and then we'll take
care of the rest later.

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:28.538
All right? Come on.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:31.117
- Sissy?
- Danice!

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.442
Shh.

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:33.954
I'm here, sissy.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.122
DR, get her up on the stage.
Lay her down.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.190
- You got it, bro.
- Help Danice keep her calm.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.892
You're okay, honey.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.862
Adultery Guy, boil some water.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:44.164
Naked Girl, try to
find some scissors.

01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.666
Hey, don't think you can
bark your orders at me.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.002
Go get some fucking scissors!

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:51.371
Uh, Nasty Chick, get some ice.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:53.806
Bring the bucket in case all
that beer comes back up.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.509
Homophobe, blankets, pillows
if you can find them.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:59.279
- I gotta make a phone call.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.646
In the boxes.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.616
Them demons in him! And
he'll give my baby the gay!

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.750
In the box, in the box.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.887
Nando, pillows, and
sheets, and blankets.

01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:08.721
As many as you can find.

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:10.823
And Father... - Yeah.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.816
A prayer, if you please.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.891
Come on. Turn her around.
Bring her to me.

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.398
Turn her around towards me.

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:20.066
All right. Turn her around.

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:23.236
Just breathe.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.761
Thank you.

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:27.941
No, this time isn't
about my husband!

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:31.011
We have a woman giving birth!

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.436
Soon!

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.985
DR, how's everything
on the top half?

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:40.177
It's good.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.656
DR, the hell that mean?

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.625
Doctor, of course.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:46.960
Okay.

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.362
They're not gonna make it.
They're not coming.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.898
Okay. That's okay. That's okay.

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:53.499
We're doing just fine.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.136
Okay, but it's been, like...
10 years.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.571
At least I have done
this before, though.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:04:59.839
Me too.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:01.174
Since when do you have kids?

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:02.608
I don't.

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.144
Then how do you know so much?

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:05.645
There's an app for that.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:06.846
Seriously?

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.016
Roxy... I'm a nurse.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.151
No shit?

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:12.986
No shit. Keep breathing.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.587
Wow.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:15.611
Okay.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.524
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where you going?

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:19.425
You don't need me.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.386
Yeah. I need you. With me.

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:24.888
Shh.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.100
Okay, okay.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.502
I'd say you're about eight
centimeters dilated.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:30.636
Two centimeters to go.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.895
You two staying over here?

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:35.942
I never go south of the
border without a passport.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:39.312
Definitely out of
my jurisdiction.

01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:44.508
I want you guys to know, just...

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:47.211
It really... - Hey!

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.215
Nobody gives a shit.

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.961
Evidently, the Pope thinks
I shouldn't either.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.724
No, it's just...

01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:04.004
It's just what Autumn said.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:05.371
You know?

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.307
It's not like I'm, whatever-

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:09.309
like I'm some closet case.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.311
Or in denial.

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:12.478
Right?

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:14.714
I'm proud of being a Marine.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.716
And I'm proud to be gay!

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.741
All right?

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.020
If anyone's got a
problem with that...

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:22.155
Hey, hey, hey. I'm
proud of you too.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:24.390
But check this place out.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:25.691
All right?

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.760
You know who comes in here?

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.753
Bikers. Rednecks.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.066
People who basically
would make politicians

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.125
look morally virtuous.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.528
So, in the morning...

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:42.508
the plows are gonna
clear off the roads...

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:44.510
and you're gonna be free.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:45.902
Outta here.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.073
So like I said...

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:51.708
Who gives a shit?

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:56.389
- Danice?
- Yes, baby?

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.558
I'm sorry I said
you killed Mama.

01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:03.996
It's okay.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.067
I knew she didn't want to be
hooked up to no machines,

01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:09.025
but I was just pissed...

01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:11.961
'cause you was
always her favorite.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.440
No.

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:16.042
She didn't.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:18.578
Are you kidding me? She
liked you the best.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:21.114
- Nuh-uh.
- Yuh-huh.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.915
You were her baby.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:24.417
You were her favorite
from the moment

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:27.520
she pushed your way
into this world.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:28.812
Really?

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:30.623
Really, really.

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:34.660
Okay. They're comin' faster now.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.684
Danice...

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.132
You know I'm not made to stay
home with no babies, right?

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.290
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.635
You gonna help me
with this one too.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:44.528
Right?

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:47.107
Right? - Shh, shh.

01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:48.308
Shh, shh, hey.

01:07:48.332 --> 01:07:50.076
Why don't we just worry about
having this one first?

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.201
Okay?

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.148
Now it's time to start working.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:57.016
What the fuck you think
I've been doin'?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.120
Okay, next contraction,
I need you to push.

01:08:00.144 --> 01:08:02.021
Roxy, try the ambulance
again, okay?

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.656
And bring me a bucket
for the placenta.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.491
We have to save it
for the paramedics.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.827
Okay? And push! Push!

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.962
There you go. Good girl.
Good, good, good.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.366
Reminds me of my second.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:24.934
We almost didn't make it.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.515
And I thought we would deliver
him by the side of the road.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.916
Marco, are you there?

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.209
Pick up.

01:08:33.377 --> 01:08:35.821
I'm sitting here wondering
where I fucked up.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.055
Was it the time we
crossed swords,

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.747
peeing in the backyard?

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.399
I shouldn't have
called your wife.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:50.470
And I shouldn't
fire you on Monday.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.671
Breathe.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.106
But I guess we all do
what we gotta do, huh?

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.403
Is it because I always
call you my bitch?

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:07.787
Is it that time that I dressed
you up like a little girl?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.488
Wait, that would
fucking make me gay.

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:10.956
Dude. Whatever.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.492
Just call me back, dude. Okay?

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:13.796
I can fucking talk
you out of it.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.734
You don't wanna watch
the joy of birth?

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:35.981
Yeah.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.974
Right after I shave my
head with a cheese grater.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.221
Too many fucked-up
people in this world

01:09:42.246 --> 01:09:43.523
to bring another one in, right?

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:44.990
Yeah.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.151
I know someone who's already
brought in two kids too many.

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:51.621
What you did with the
phone was brave.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.368
Brave?

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:57.126
Guy couldn't make up his mind.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.305
You did it for him.

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:01.164
Push! There you go. Good girl!
Good girl!

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.301
And breathe.

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:07.804
Can I ask you a favor?

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.141
It'll cost you.

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:26.189
It's risky.

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.192
I'm gonna need
hazardous duty pay.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.006
There's a sturdy counter
in the bathroom.

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.299
Copy that.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:48.588
Shh, shh.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:50.756
Okay, only a few more.
Only a few more.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.758
You're almost there.
Come on, push.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.861
Good, good, good, good.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.464
Okay, and breathe. And
breathe, and breathe.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:10:59.965
It's a secret recipe, man.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.935
It's been passing down through
generations through generations.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.404
So what generation are you?

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:05.805
Third generation chili maker?

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:06.863
Fourth!

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:09.409
And it's not just the chili.

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:10.543
- No?
- No.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:13.979
I'm death on ribs, barbecue,

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.748
omelets, all of it.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.383
I should have known
you were gay.

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:22.154
I enjoyed the show.

01:11:22.178 --> 01:11:23.823
I bet you don't see
naked women too often.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.325
You'd be surprised.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:26.826
- Really?
- Sure.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:28.794
Insecure women,
afraid of rejection,

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.330
trying to re-affirm
their sexuality

01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:31.655
by seducing the unobtainable.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:36.201
Women trying to work
through their child abuses

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.371
and approaching a father figure.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.039
What a head-hump.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:42.342
So, women with latent
homosexuality issues

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:44.844
operating through the parameter

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:47.980

crap all the time.

What did you do to my car?

Strangest fucking
thing, I tell you.

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.621
I went out to my truck
to get a condom...

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:09.402
and I saw an icicle
break off the roof...

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:12.237
and crash through a really
nice car's windshield...

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.730
and...

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.776
knock the shifter
into neutral...

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.711
bounce off the dash board...

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.380
and unleash the parking brake.

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:21.547
What?!

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.749
And now it's rolling
towards a cliff.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.074
Precious!

Strangest fucking
thing, I tell you.

Jeez, I think that's the head.

more push, honey.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.106
but I think it'll
just sound the same.

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.799
She... didn't move on.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:21.470
She was seduced.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.974
We've all been seduced
at some point.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:32.548
Murr?

01:22:33.716 --> 01:22:36.352
Murray? Where are ya?

01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:39.364
Oh, lord.

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:46.328
What?

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.673
So we're the only
ones who got any.

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.266
Don't be fucking hatin'.

01:22:51.234 --> 01:22:53.645
I'm gonna pour myself
a glass of wine.

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:54.737
Skip?

01:22:56.005 --> 01:22:58.507
Ooh! - Fucking brew.

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:01.110
She can still walk?

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:07.392
But first, time to
respect the urethra.

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:09.028
Semper Fi, piss or die!

01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:10.353
Hoo-ah.

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:15.358
Oh, man.

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:17.836
What?

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.871
I think I left the bucket of
placenta in the men's room.

01:23:19.895 --> 01:23:21.206
Oh!

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:22.841
I should probably tell him.

01:23:22.865 --> 01:23:24.743
No, no, no, no, no!

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.447
You're right. You're right.
Don't tell him.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:36.321
What the fuck was that?!

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.690
Did you piss yourself?!

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:40.059
Fuck you, man!

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.155
Oh no!

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:51.203
Jesus Christ!

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.405
Murray! Help me! Murray!

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:55.006
- Oh, God.
- Murray! Murray!

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.275
No!

01:23:56.299 --> 01:23:57.976
Murray. Murray.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.614
It's too late.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:03.582
- No!
- No!

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:05.450
- Bennett. Bennett!
- No! No!

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:07.252
Bennett, he's been
gone too long.

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:09.054
- Oh, no!
- - There's nothing we can do.

01:24:09.078 --> 01:24:11.323
Oh, God, Murray!

01:24:11.347 --> 01:24:13.258
- Roxy, Roxy, Roxy.
- No!

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:14.826
- He's gone, baby.
- No!

01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:16.795
- Go get the priest!
- No! No!

01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:18.730
He was a Catholic
when he was a kid!

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:19.822
Maybe that'll help.

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:25.104
He must have passed about the
same time the baby was born.

01:24:26.929 --> 01:24:27.996
You...

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:30.509
You can't do this to me!

01:24:30.533 --> 01:24:31.767
Bennett.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.483
Fuck you!

01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:40.252
I didn't expect you to die.

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.786
I thought that we could make up.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.822
You know?

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:46.024
He wasn't supposed to die.

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:47.383
He was just...

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:49.628
Jesus Christ.

01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.763

Okay, okay, Bennett, okay.

So, what now?

01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:37.733
What happens to this place?

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:44.907
Murray always said he kept
his will in the till.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:49.053
Did Murray have any family?

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.489
Uh-uh.

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:53.325

being of drunk mind
and ripped body...

leave this as my last will.

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:58.414
Since I don't have a family...

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:02.594
I leave everything... I have

area of the pool table.

My bar, I leave to Bennett.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.662
I never had a brother...

but if I did...

roller disco rink

"Please bury me...
with a Jameson's."

01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:05.608
Wow.

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.746
What am I gonna do with the bar?

01:29:12.415 --> 01:29:13.749
Hire me.

I'll cook... and Marco
could tend the bar.

Roxanne, you better sign
those divorce papers quick.
