14:12.060 --> 14:13.436
Sorry. Too recent.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.147
That's not gonna show up in any
pawnshop chits for at least a month.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.234
Tell me something.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.070
What would you do
if you had to solve this crime?

14:24.614 --> 14:25.740
Your old man.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.784
He had a sign above his desk that said,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.828
"Get off your ass and knock on doors."

14:30.287 --> 14:31.204
Yeah, he still does.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.248
True as it ever was.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.377
Never crossed my mind.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.047
You've never thought
that blowing up an oil pipeline

14:41.131 --> 14:44.009
was anything less
than a big fat fucking felony?

14:44.092 --> 14:46.052
Sure, but domestic terrorism?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.971
Isn't that a bridge too far?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.307
Look, all I'm saying, you get a subpoena,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.267
you lawyer up before you go, yeah?

14:53.685 --> 14:54.603
I don't think we'll need one.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.812
How's that, Barrel?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.231
In a pickle, take the nickel.

14:58.315 --> 15:02.027
Taking the Fifth
doesn't look great on our resume, but...

15:02.110 --> 15:05.238
But we're retired. We don't have resumes.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.282
Gone, but not forgotten.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.784
Forgotten, but not gone.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.952
Jesus Christ.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.454
You guys need to come up
with new material.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.956
We're comfortable with what we've got.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.583
Sanguine, even.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.132
[horns honking]

15:29.429 --> 15:32.057
[woman] Came in, made a return.
No receipt, natch.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.392
Went back out to her car
and then scream bloody murder

15:34.476 --> 15:36.144
when she saw that her bag was missing.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.813
Right. I'm gonna need to take a look
at your security cam footage

15:38.897 --> 15:40.231
just from the front of the store, please.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.232
Not a problem.

15:52.035 --> 15:55.038
[soft dramatic music playing]

16:26.069 --> 16:27.946
So they have evidence.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.573
What kind of evidence?
What could they possibly have?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.909
We'll find that out at the arraignment.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.661
I didn't even know this lady.

16:34.744 --> 16:38.790
Lexi Parks, assistant city manager,
West Hollywood.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.501
Her husband, an LASD deputy sheriff,

16:41.584 --> 16:43.461
came home
after working the graveyard shift

16:43.545 --> 16:46.631
and found her bludgeoned to death.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.175
Jesus Christ.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.178
You sure it wasn't him?

16:52.262 --> 16:53.763
Nearest and dearest.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.057
No, his, his alibi is bulletproof.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.060
David, do you have an alibi
for that night?

16:59.144 --> 17:01.563
Who remembers
what they were doing four months ago?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.694
I mean, what day of the week
are we talking about?

17:07.777 --> 17:08.903
[Honey] Friday.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.781
Friday. I was with Louise.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.452
I must-- it must have been.
Oh, that's our date night.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.369
You remember where?

17:17.454 --> 17:18.704
I-- home.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.374
Okay. I'll need to talk to her.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.501
- She'll vouch for me.
- Oh, I'm sure she will.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.211
Anyone else?

17:26.588 --> 17:27.589
No.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.887
"Memphis Soul Stew," King Curtis.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.724
My man, the late great,
cut down in his prime.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.519
I prefer the live version
of Fillmore West, but that's just me.

17:41.603 --> 17:45.273
I don't disagree. You could have called.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.400
It was safer to drop by.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.402
- You clean?
- [Mo] Just finished a suite.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.447
So Rose & Associates.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.117
I found an unsigned email
sent from a Rose & Associates computer

17:56.201 --> 17:58.328
- that I couldn't hack.
- What's your best guess?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.579
[Mo] John Law.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.622
FBI?

18:00.705 --> 18:03.541
Maybe. Encrypted up the wazoo.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.794
- [Harry] Dead end?
- Not quite.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.171
They had an attachment I could hack.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.426
Some kind of blueprint.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.220
It's the schematic
for the shipping container

18:15.303 --> 18:16.429
where the bodies were found.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.515
Oh, tin can coffin.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.016
Who sent it?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.268
Not like we have a plethora of suspects.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.271
If it's an inside job,
my money is on Ramirez.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.899
Old man Rose
can barely operate the fridge.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.235
We follow them both.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.528
[knocks on door]

18:36.491 --> 18:38.243
[Maddie] Afternoon, sir. LAPD.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.536
That your Tesla?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.871
Is there a problem, Officer?
I paid that ticket online.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.998
I'd like to take a look at the footage
from your car's cameras.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.418
Hmm. Of course.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.212
What's this about?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
Trying to catch a thief.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.383
Your Honor,
we'd like to continue the arraignment

18:53.466 --> 18:55.969
until after we have a chance
to look over discovery.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.637
Any objections, Mr. Landreth?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.180
No, Your Honor.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.475
Mr. Foster, do you waive
your right to arraignment

19:02.559 --> 19:04.727
and plea until a later date?

19:05.728 --> 19:07.647
Yes, I do, Your Honor.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.733
You'll schedule a hearing
for 30 days from today.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.986
Bail set at no bail.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.362
Does either party wish to be heard?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.323
No, Your Honor. Not at this time.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.283
No, Your Honor.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.076
We'll see you all at the next date.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.203
Have you talked to Louise yet?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.372
It's next on my list.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.583
Hold fast, David. Stay strong.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.127
- I don't know if I can.
- You can.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.712
I'm here for you.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.339
[bailiff] Come on, let's go.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.470
So what's your timeline on discovery?

19:39.554 --> 19:40.930
End of the day.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.015
Oh. Thank you, Brett.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.391
Just a heads up.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.810
Oh, I hate it
when prosecutors say heads up.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.604
Usually means
they're about to chop off yours.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.274
DNA analysis
connects your client to the victim.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.692
I don't see how that's possible.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.737
Found on and in the body.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.697
[Marty]
Does he have an alibi?

19:58.239 --> 19:59.532
He was with his wife.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.409
That's not great.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.745
At least it's not his mother.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.582
- You heading out?
- I am.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.710
- Have a good evening, Marty.
- [Marty] You as well.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.678
[soft music playing]

20:21.387 --> 20:22.221
Mo, you see him?

20:25.391 --> 20:26.434
Got him.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.154
[car engine revving]

20:43.743 --> 20:46.746
[soft tense music playing]

21:10.937 --> 21:13.523
I have to say, I'm loving the hair.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.776
I wanted a new look.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.197
Let me ask you something.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.451
When did you know it was time to go back?

21:28.830 --> 21:29.914
I didn't.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.502
I just did it.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.633
Does the job feel the same?

21:44.679 --> 21:45.972
Well, I'm only on the front desk.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.142
But a woman came in,

21:49.726 --> 21:53.062
left her car unlocked
with a $35,000 bracelet

21:53.146 --> 21:54.063
sitting in the front seat.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.068
Uh, I just wanted to run with it.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.365
So, got back out there...

22:05.950 --> 22:10.079
...and it felt so good to--to feel...

22:12.248 --> 22:13.958
Something different for a change.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.418
Exactly.

22:17.795 --> 22:18.963
Yeah.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.590
I'll drink to that.

22:27.597 --> 22:30.600
[dramatic music playing]

22:34.062 --> 22:37.315
[car door opens, closes]

22:42.111 --> 22:43.446
Rose is home.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.156
How long you want me to hang around?

22:45.740 --> 22:48.451
[Harry] I guess that's it for the night,
come meet me here, 24 Blanca.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.828
I know that place.

22:50.912 --> 22:53.164
Salvadorian, killer for [indistinct]

22:55.249 --> 22:56.834
Ramirez just walked in.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.512
Any chance you got a camera
with you with a long lens?

23:07.929 --> 23:09.263
[Mo] Matter of fact, I do.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.933
Couple came in after Ramirez.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.310
Loose fitting tropical shirts
like the ones you wear.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.604
Good taste in haberdashery.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.023
They're FBI and they're strapped.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.109
[Mo] Hence the shirts.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.735
Exactly.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.195
Go ahead and take off.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.780
I got him when he comes out.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.156
I'll text the pics.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.703
[mellow music playing]

23:42.672 --> 23:44.173
[phone vibrates, chimes]

24:09.115 --> 24:10.533
- [line ringing]
- [Maddie] I'm not here.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.576
Leave a message.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.328
Hey, Mads.
I'm just calling to see where you are.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.581
Can you call back when you have a chance?

24:17.248 --> 24:18.374
Just checking in.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.750
No big deal.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.919
[phone vibrates, chimes]

24:27.008 --> 24:30.011
[mellow music playing]

24:41.147 --> 24:43.608
There's no way
Matthew is talking to the Feds.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.735
Well, I know for a fact he is.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.282
Fuck me.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.410
I feel so betrayed.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.995
Should I fire him?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.288
What does Ramirez know?

24:57.371 --> 24:59.332
- How much can he hurt us?
- [Honey] A lot.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.543
He identified the schematic
and located the tracking number

25:02.627 --> 25:04.003
for the shipping schedule.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.881
Maybe, we keep him in place.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.341
We might be able to use him.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.053
[sighs]

25:12.553 --> 25:14.764
I could feed him misinformation,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.308
walk the FBI into an entrapment case

25:17.391 --> 25:18.517
that'll stop this in its tracks.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.019
Worth a try.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.941
[Honey] You need to be working for me
to preserve attorney-client privilege.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.068
Is that the same dollar as last time?

25:28.110 --> 25:29.237
I saved it for good luck.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.865
And to explain our frequent meetings
and communications,

25:32.949 --> 25:34.325
I'll have to put you on a case.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.452
What is the case?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.828
Lexi Parks.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.290
I have the files in my car.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.047
Swell.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.966
If it makes you feel any better,

25:50.049 --> 25:53.010
I happen to believe our client,
David Foster, is innocent.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.096
Of course, you do.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.556
Good work, Bosch.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.684
Thanks, John.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.602
Give this to the detective
covering the case.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.152
[foreboding music playing]

26:50.651 --> 26:53.654
[birds chirping]

27:00.619 --> 27:01.871
You're thinking of buying?

27:04.081 --> 27:05.207
Maybe.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.126
[woman] It's quite a story.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.586
Yeah, how's that?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.965
Wife was murdered in the house,
if you can believe it,

27:13.049 --> 27:15.343
by an intruder
while her husband was at work.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.887
That's terrible.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.722
Soon as the crime scene tape came down,

27:19.805 --> 27:20.931
the for-sale sign went up.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.559
You know what happened?

27:25.019 --> 27:26.437
I didn't hear a thing.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.190
Her husband found the body.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.901
You can't blame him for wanting to sell.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.694
No, you can't.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.529
I couldn't live there.

27:35.613 --> 27:36.864
So you didn't hear anything?

27:37.281 --> 27:38.491
Nothing.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.911
- Alarm went off?
- It wasn't said.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.456
You'd think him being
in law enforcement and all but...

27:45.539 --> 27:48.084
Well, people get careless, right?

27:49.794 --> 27:50.836
How about the dog, did it bark?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.254
They didn't have a dog.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.840
- No dog?
- Never did. Just the sign.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.596
Maybe the bad guy knew there wasn't a dog.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.978
[Jen]
Tesla built-in video cam.

28:08.062 --> 28:09.647
- Who knew?
- Yeah, I know, right?

28:10.147 --> 28:12.483
Got the plate, got the registration.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.568
Got the thief.

28:14.652 --> 28:15.986
Good police work, Boot.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.614
Way beyond what you're
supposed to be doing.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.907
As usual.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.326
I just don't want it
to get lost in the shuffle.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.663
I will personally pass it off
to the detective in-charge.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.373
You're the best.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.375
You're not so bad yourself.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.377
I was raised right.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.670
[Jen] Damn straight.

28:32.753 --> 28:36.382
So the writer says,
"My agents came to my house?"

28:36.465 --> 28:38.467
[laughing]

28:38.551 --> 28:39.552
James.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.761
Customer.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.607
Want some company?

28:57.862 --> 28:59.029
I was just leaving.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.407
Care to join me?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.203
Buy me a drink first.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.544
Relax.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.463
Make yourself comfortable.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.425
I'm just gonna freshen up.

29:29.727 --> 29:30.561
James.

29:30.644 --> 29:31.562
[engine revving]

29:32.688 --> 29:33.606
What is it?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.400
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head about.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.403
I'll be right back.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.164
[door closes]

29:50.247 --> 29:52.875
[engine revving]

29:54.710 --> 29:56.879
[tires screeching]

30:09.433 --> 30:11.560
He was home that night with me.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.270
Did anyone else see him here?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.105
No.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.900
Did he talk to anyone on the phone?

30:18.609 --> 30:19.735
I don't remember.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.696
I need to corroborate your story.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.074
I thought you were
supposed to be on our side.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.742
I am, a hundred percent.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.537
And I--I want his defense
to be rock solid.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.121
But you're his wife.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.332
And a jury is not gonna
just take your word for it.

30:33.415 --> 30:36.585
So, I need to know the truth.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.046
Where was he that night?

30:41.215 --> 30:42.424
I don't know.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.095
[sighs]

30:46.178 --> 30:47.304
Do you have any idea?

30:49.932 --> 30:52.351
I do and I don't.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.980
I can't believe she gave me up.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.481
She cares about you, David.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.899
She's not stupid.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.026
She knows you're using again.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.238
So, you wanna tell me
where you were and with whom?

31:06.657 --> 31:07.950
A friend.

31:08.576 --> 31:09.618
Friend have a name?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.203
James Allen.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.246
[Honey] He's your alibi.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.415
Why didn't you tell me
that from the start?

31:16.667 --> 31:17.668
I'm sorry.

31:17.751 --> 31:19.253
Apology not accepted.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.839
I was hoping to keep it a secret.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.090
I thought you were clean.

31:23.173 --> 31:28.137
I was... until about six months ago.

31:28.220 --> 31:32.099
I--I ran into this old friend.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.770
We did some lines
and one thing led to another

31:36.854 --> 31:38.814
and I thought I could keep it
under control.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.567
This old friend, same guy?

31:42.568 --> 31:43.777
James Allen.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.072
I'll need his number. What does he do?

31:48.824 --> 31:49.783
He's my dealer.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.125
I got a call from the detectives
that you found my bracelet?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.961
- Made an arrest, too.
- What about the bag?

32:01.045 --> 32:03.505
The Kate Spade, I don't think so.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.549
That's it.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.885
So, when do I get it back?

32:07.968 --> 32:09.428
After the criminal case is closed.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.763
Oh, my God. I can't wait for that.

32:10.846 --> 32:11.889
That could be months.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.474
It's evidence. Sorry.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.517
I'm not pressing charges.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.394
Well, that's not up to you or me.

32:17.478 --> 32:18.729
Who's it up to?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.981
The detective in charge
and the DA's office.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.316
This person is a thief.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.651
She committed a felony.

32:23.734 --> 32:24.985
I don't give a shit about that.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.863
Tell the detective
to drop the fucking charges.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.615
I'll come back tomorrow to pick it up.

32:32.493 --> 32:36.664
Matthew, I hired Harry Bosch
to work on the Foster defense.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.792
So, make sure he's copied
on everything as discovery comes in.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.460
- Will do.
- Okay.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.962
Oh, by the way, before I forget.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.215
I want you to bring me every document

32:46.298 --> 32:49.468
pertaining to the civil suit
we filed against Carl Rogers

32:49.551 --> 32:50.803
on [indistinct] behalf.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.222
Every hardcopy, every email.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.766
Is that a problem?

32:56.642 --> 32:57.935
No, not at all.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.687
Okay.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.700
Harry Bosch.

33:12.783 --> 33:13.826
I'm not answering any of your questions,

33:13.909 --> 33:15.494
so you can put your subpoena on the table

33:15.577 --> 33:17.663
and you can both shag ass
away from my crib.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.206
You know the drill.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.376
You're either a cooperating witness
or a target.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.086
Thanks for the offer. I'll pass.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.004
I know about the pipeline, Bosch.

33:26.088 --> 33:29.007
You and your gang of misfits
and has-beens blew it up

33:29.091 --> 33:31.051
so Rogers couldn't pay the Russians
what he owed them.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.138
Misfits and has-beens, really?

33:35.097 --> 33:36.348
It hurts.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.686
[dramatic music playing]

33:52.072 --> 33:55.075
[siren wailing in distance]

33:55.743 --> 33:58.746
[tranquil music playing]

34:26.982 --> 34:28.900
- [man] I love it, too.
- [woman] Yeah.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.985
I haven't seen you here before.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.614
Does that sound like a line?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.324
Hmm. You have to ask.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.409
Right?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.120
It's my first time.

34:40.704 --> 34:41.914
So, what do you think?

34:42.581 --> 34:44.166
Hmm, too soon to tell.

34:46.752 --> 34:50.255
You see, meditation rewires your brain,

34:51.130 --> 34:53.300
relaxes the amygdala.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.385
The amygdala, huh?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.596
You can look it up.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.350
Huh. I don't know
if I want my brain rewired.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.477
I'd settle for a little less
stress in my day.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.271
You've come to the right place.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.398
We'll see.

35:10.484 --> 35:13.487
[moaning]

35:19.493 --> 35:20.786
[knocks on door]

35:21.787 --> 35:22.913
Get that, will you?

35:22.996 --> 35:25.499
Ordered us a little something
from DoorDash.

35:30.879 --> 35:31.755
Who the fuck are you?

35:32.506 --> 35:34.007
Ash? Ash?

35:34.091 --> 35:35.092
Ash ain't coming over.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.094
We got you on video.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.180
As soon as we clean up the picture
and enhance the sound,

35:40.264 --> 35:43.934
Carey will be able to stream
that bad boy direct to your widescreen.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.727
That's your wife's name, right, Carey?

35:45.811 --> 35:47.646
Or is that the daughter, Kelly, Carey?

35:47.729 --> 35:49.106
Ellie? I get it mixed up.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.692
Please. I made a mistake.

35:51.775 --> 35:52.943
[man] Save it.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.070
What do you want?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.864
What the fuck do you think we want?

35:59.783 --> 36:00.742
How much?

36:04.746 --> 36:05.747
Harry?

36:05.831 --> 36:07.541
[Harry] So, I've been through
the discovery materials

36:07.624 --> 36:08.876
and I can't find any evidence

36:08.959 --> 36:11.795
that David Foster
and Lexi Parks ever crossed paths.

36:11.879 --> 36:13.255
Not in this lifetime.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.548
[Honey] And that bothers you?

36:14.631 --> 36:16.800
Yeah. That bothers me a lot.

36:16.884 --> 36:17.801
Next step?

36:17.885 --> 36:19.303
[Harry] Meet your client face to face.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.762
I can arrange that.

36:20.846 --> 36:21.763
[Harry]
Follow up with the wife.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.974
Yeah. She changed the story.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.767
It turns out she wasn't
with him after all.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.895
- So, no alibi witness?
- [Honey] One.

36:27.978 --> 36:28.979
I have a number.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.397
I just haven't been able to reach him yet.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.648
Who's the friend?

36:31.732 --> 36:33.025
[Honey]
His name is James Allen.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.234
He's David's dealer.

36:34.318 --> 36:37.112
They were together
that night getting high.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.363
[Harry] No wonder he lied.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.990
Well, he didn't want his wife to know.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.366
He thought he could keep it a secret.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.370
This is why I hate defense work,
the clientele.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.040
[line beeping]

36:50.125 --> 36:51.835
[Lucas] He showed us the door
right from the get-go.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.295
Yeah. I'm not surprised.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.214
We need a warrant
for a wire on Chandler's phones.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.841
Bosch, too.

36:57.925 --> 36:58.926
Bosch we can do.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.887
But a wiretap on an attorney,
particularly this attorney,

37:01.970 --> 37:03.764
it won't get past the federal judge.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.098
It's not happening.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.268
Let's see what Chandler says
in front of the grand jury.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.479
- She'll just take the Fifth.
- Bosch, too.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.813
Well, put them on the record.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.732
In the meantime...

37:20.072 --> 37:22.783
[pensive music playing]

37:32.834 --> 37:34.503
[metal creaks]

37:45.138 --> 37:47.724
Hey, how was your day?

37:48.350 --> 37:49.559
It was okay.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.436
What are you looking at?

37:51.979 --> 37:53.188
Crime scene photos.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.023
The case you're working on with Chandler?

37:55.107 --> 37:56.942
- Lexi Parks.
- I thought you swore off.

37:57.025 --> 37:59.069
Working with Chandler, I did.

38:01.363 --> 38:02.656
Show me.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.369
Mads, you don't wanna look at these.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.162
They're brutal.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.581
I'd like to see them.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.627
I'm a cop, not a delicate flower.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.295
I wanna see what you're working on.

38:21.550 --> 38:22.634
Okay.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.572
Why did he cover her face with a pillow?

38:44.656 --> 38:45.699
I don't know.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.078
Maybe so he wouldn't have to look at
what he'd done, you know.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.330
Compartmentalize.

38:53.415 --> 38:54.541
Denial.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.844
You're right.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.637
They're disturbing.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.019
You think he knew her?

39:15.187 --> 39:16.605
I don't know yet.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.190
It's high in my list.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.485
What was the point of contact
between the killer and the victim?

39:23.236 --> 39:24.404
What was the crossing?

39:24.488 --> 39:26.073
Where did they cross paths?

39:26.156 --> 39:27.449
[Harry] Exactly.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.577
If I can answer that, I'm halfway there.

39:33.455 --> 39:34.748
Was she raped?

39:38.710 --> 39:39.836
Yes, she was.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.635
I was lucky.

39:50.472 --> 39:51.932
Don't minimize your ordeal.

39:52.015 --> 39:52.849
[Maddie] I don't.

39:53.683 --> 39:58.563
Believe me, what happened to me was awful.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.609
It could have been so much worse.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.738
I think about that sometimes.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.121
Dockweiler's sentencing is company up.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.582
Yeah, I know.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.838
Have you given any more thought
to your victim impact statement?

40:22.921 --> 40:23.797
[Maddie] Kinda.

40:24.548 --> 40:25.632
A little.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.426
Not really.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.429
It might be helpful to you.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.100
I don't really see how.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.518
Articulate your feelings.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.230
Or-or worse, it--it could make me
feel worse dwelling on it.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.485
If you like, I can help you with it.

40:47.737 --> 40:48.572
Thanks.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.198
I'll let you know.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.283
I'm--I'm tired.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.493
I'm just gonna head to bed.

40:53.952 --> 40:54.786
Sure.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.371
Look, Mads.

40:58.498 --> 40:59.499
No pressure.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.128
You know, you didn't really
answer my question.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.214
Why are you working this case?

41:07.048 --> 41:08.341
Client is innocent,

41:09.384 --> 41:11.052
which means the real killer
is still out there.

41:13.096 --> 41:16.057
And because every time
I look at her face, I see your face.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.107
What happened to Lexi Parks
could have happened to you, too.

41:30.906 --> 41:32.073
Goodnight.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.119
Goodnight.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.079
[door opens]

41:45.754 --> 41:46.838
[lock clicks]

42:18.912 --> 42:21.915
[dramatic music playing]

42:50.026 --> 42:51.611
[Harry]
Next time on Bosch: Legacy.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.613
I mean, what's the rush?
It's only been a few months.

42:53.697 --> 42:55.282
I--I need my own place.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.783
There's an opening in our unit.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.118
I've been looking for
the right person to fill it.

42:58.201 --> 43:01.121
Bosch and Chandler
at the port at the same time.

43:01.204 --> 43:03.665
Bosch and his associates, the pipeline.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.584
- Still need to prove it.
- Your client is a liar.

43:06.668 --> 43:10.630
A liar, an adulterer, an addict,
not a murderer.

43:10.714 --> 43:12.007
I can't wait to meet him.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.550
What else is keeping you up late?

43:14.551 --> 43:15.552
[sighs]

43:15.635 --> 43:17.137
[cell phone ringing]

43:17.220 --> 43:19.055
[Marty]
Honey? What's wrong?

43:19.139 --> 43:22.642
Marty, I'm sorry to bother you at home,
but I have a situation.

43:24.060 --> 43:27.063
