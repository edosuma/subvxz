00:20.360 --> 00:22.761
I like to improvise.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.485
I always think I like
to do things

00:24.640 --> 00:27.849
as though I'm...
I'm playing jazz.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.889
Try this, try that.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.167
Okay, the sneakers
from Home Shopping.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.243
I design them and I sell them.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.041
Ordinary black denim jeans.
I'm a denim freak.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.884
Reminded me of a railroad man.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.691
When I was a kid,
I was a railroad buff.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.161
These bracelets
come from Harlem.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.890
These I have such a long time,

00:49.040 --> 00:50.485
I don't even remember
where they came from,

00:50.640 --> 00:52.847
but they were like
slivers of black,

00:53.000 --> 00:54.126
so I love them.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.691
And then these are just things
I've been collecting

00:58.840 --> 01:00.330
over the years.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.407
AnyWaY-

01:02.560 --> 01:03.925
Another mad outfit.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.283
These are my shoes,
smoking slippers.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.410
Suede, embroidered.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.645
This kind of tunic
is from the Mao people,

01:14.840 --> 01:16.604
Chinese minority.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.041
It had a big hood,
and I didn't like the hood,

01:19.200 --> 01:20.850
so I made it into a collar.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.085
And this is part
of my collection of amber.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.971
And then bracelets
from all over the place,

01:28.120 --> 01:29.963
including these ladybugs.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.369
Okay?

01:39.720 --> 01:41.722
I like to put
things together like this.

01:41.880 --> 01:47.410
This is an old jacket
from, uh... Ungaro.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.325
I love the way it's lined.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.121
And these are Gianni Versace
trousers.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.250
So they're kind of fun together.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.721
I'll wear them
with a black turtleneck.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.530
Just has to feel right with me.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.802
Every time I do it,
I do a different way.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.646
I like individuality.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.362
So lost these days.
There's so much sameness.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.291
Everything is homogenized.
I hate it.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.245
Whatever.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.410
- Albert?
- Yes?

02:36.560 --> 02:38.085
Do you think we're demented?

02:41.040 --> 02:42.246
So easy to amuse me.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.449
I get more kick out of this
that costs $4 and change

02:45.640 --> 02:49.122
than if my husband took me
to Harry Winston.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.802
People interview me
and they keeping asking me

02:51.960 --> 02:54.008
about all these rules,
and I say

02:54.160 --> 02:56.003
I don't have any rules
because I would

02:56.160 --> 02:58.731
only be breaking them,
so it's a waste of time.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.531
With me, it's not intellectual.
It's all gut.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.444
I see something,
"Oh, that'll go with this."

03:03.600 --> 03:04.965
I'll try it on.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.446
It's totally,
totally the involvement

03:06.600 --> 03:08.125
and the process.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.566
It's the process
I like much better

03:09.720 --> 03:11.006
even than wearing it.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.922
What could you do
on these three pieces?

03:15.080 --> 03:17.845
Fifteen, 25, 30.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.411
How about $25 for all three?

03:20.560 --> 03:21.766
Can you do $20?

03:21.920 --> 03:24.446
Mm, all right, why not?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.569
I think it was
some very famous clothes horse

03:31.720 --> 03:34.007
said the best thing
was getting dressed.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.810
She didn't give a damn
about going to the party

03:35.960 --> 03:37.041
or being at the party.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.929
It was getting dressed
for the party.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.447
And there's more truth
and poetry in that.

03:54.040 --> 03:58.011
We are so pleased
to have Iris Apfel.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.642
This event will show you
how she works

04:01.840 --> 04:04.525
with people, their bodies,

04:04.720 --> 04:07.405
and the way they should look
or the way they can look.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.285
What brings you
to our fair shore?

04:10.440 --> 04:12.966
I want something that
represents my personality

04:13.120 --> 04:16.680
but is also classic,
so I need help.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.241
There's somebody I've had
my eye on.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.920
You, you, with the earrings.
Come here, girl.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.921
- Oh.
- Oh, wowie-wow.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.363
This was a Gaultier.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.842
I thought it needed a belt.
So we added the belt.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.329
The shawl is also an add-on,
but look at those shoes.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.686
She looks very Vogue-y.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.925
This was something that
when lris picked it out,

04:44.080 --> 04:45.764
I thought she was a little...

04:45.920 --> 04:47.206
I thought her 90 years
was showing.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.124
I never would
have worn this myself.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.009
I would have looked at it
on the rack and kept going.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.321
But I love it.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.683
This is my wild child.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.687
She told me that sometimes
she has to go to occasions

05:00.840 --> 05:03.241
where she has to be
a bit more sophisticated.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.050
And I thought,
now that's a challenge,

05:05.240 --> 05:08.926
to make her look sophisticated
and kooky at the same time

05:09.120 --> 05:11.122
is not the easiest thing
in the world.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.930
But we'll give it a try,

05:13.120 --> 05:15.122
so see if you think
we've succeeded.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.647
Francis, my gosh.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.409
Wow.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.049
Dress looks pure couture.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.521
The necklace I think
is Missoni.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.166
The necklace is spoken for.
I'm buying it.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.844
Okay, baby.
I think you're in.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.365
Thank you.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.721
I was very much influenced
by my mother,

05:41.880 --> 05:45.248
and my mother worshipped
at the altar of the accessory.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.243
My mother could do tricks
with a scarf

05:47.400 --> 05:49.402
that I've never seen
anybody else do.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.928
It was during Depression days
that I grew up,

05:53.120 --> 05:58.809
and my mother always said,
"Buy a good, simple

05:59.000 --> 06:00.604
little black dress

06:00.760 --> 06:03.331
and you'll always have
something to wear

06:03.480 --> 06:06.450
because you can dress it up
or you can dress it down."

06:07.240 --> 06:10.562
Thank you for sharing
your vision.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.048
And on behalf of Loehmann's
90th year,

06:14.200 --> 06:17.249
we would like to celebrate
your 90th birthday, too.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.007
Oh, what a pretty cake!
What a pretty cake!

06:21.160 --> 06:23.049
Oh, my God.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.171
Looked like the eternal flame.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.930
I had discovered Loehmann's,
it was in Brooklyn.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.289
That was when Mrs. Loehmann,
the original...

06:45.440 --> 06:47.363
who was absolutely a trip.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.091
She looked like something
out of Toulouse-Lautrec.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.084
And she would sit
on a high stool

06:53.240 --> 06:55.720
like she was observing
a tennis match.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.770
And she would look at what
everybody in the shop was doing.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.331
And she used to fixate on me,

07:00.520 --> 07:02.409
and she really made me
very uncomfortable.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.689
And one day, she called me over,
and she said,

07:05.840 --> 07:08.320
"Young lady,
I've been watching you."

07:08.480 --> 07:10.209
She said, "Don't anybody...

07:10.360 --> 07:12.966
You're not pretty,
and you'll never be pretty.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.925
But it doesn't matter.
You have something much better.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.610
You have style."

07:21.840 --> 07:23.444
Iris is an artist.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.444
What she uses all of her
clothing

07:26.600 --> 07:31.606
and her accessories to do
is compose a new vision.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.723
That for me is creativity.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.689
Other people would say,
"Well, you know,

07:37.840 --> 07:39.604
it's just getting dressed,
and we all get dressed."

07:39.760 --> 07:41.683
Well, we all take snapshots
on our phone,

07:41.840 --> 07:43.490
and that doesn't make it art.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.563
The fact that she
combines everything,

07:45.720 --> 07:48.291
what is nice, what is ugly,
what's cheap, what is chic.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.330
So all these things,
and she just mixes that,

07:51.480 --> 07:53.209
and she makes
her own style of that,

07:53.360 --> 07:55.966
and that's really...
that's inspiration for me.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.130
Her things are so special.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.681
Everything Mrs. Apfel have
is gorgeous.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.322
When I first met her,
there were all kinds of people,

08:07.480 --> 08:10.882
all ages,
all walks of life,

08:11.040 --> 08:13.202
all surrounding her.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.409
She was so engaging
to everybody, you know?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.967
And I could feel the pulse
of her life,

08:19.120 --> 08:21.122
of her excitement
about living.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.048
This is Iris Apfel,

08:25.200 --> 08:29.125
and she is
a legendary collector,

08:29.320 --> 08:31.846
um, of fashion.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.650
Exhibits of her fashions
in museums

08:33.799 --> 08:36.451
like the Metropolitan Museum
of Art's Costume Institute

08:36.600 --> 08:38.409
drew record crowds.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.642
And that was in 2005.
I went.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.450
It was extraordinary.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.568
And tell us what you're wearing
right now, Iris.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.564
Oh, this actually
I bought many years ago

08:47.720 --> 08:49.165
for my darling husband,
and...

08:49.320 --> 08:50.446
You bought this shirt?

08:50.600 --> 08:53.171
Yeah,
this was done by Versace.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.607
He painted it himself.
It's leather.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.325
So I grabbed it,
and I took it home.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.131
And I gave it to him,
and he turned up his nose.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.611
And he said, "Oh..."

09:01.760 --> 09:04.047
lfis'husband
is sitting right here.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.282
Carl is sitting right
here in the front row.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.371
And Carl has pretty
fancy pants on.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.601
Look at those pants.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.091
They're from Etro.
I bought him those.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.009
- Oh, are those new?
- Yeah.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.044
Oh, okay. Very nice.
You're right with it, Carl.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.446
Thank you, dear.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.168
This goes back
to when the dinosaurs

09:32.320 --> 09:35.210
were roaming the Earth,
1948.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.764
Articles from The Times
and other newspapers.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.764
This is what
I looked like then.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.603
I never wanted a wedding.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.205
I wanted to elope.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.050
I said I'd rather have
the money.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.200
But the parents
and the grandparents

09:59.360 --> 10:01.124
wanted the wedding.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.490
Our first date
was Columbus Day.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.129
Thanksgiving, Carl proposed.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.721
Christmas, I got blinged.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.247
Washington's birthday,
we were married.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.051
Washington's birthday,
February 22nd.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.962
There was no
Presidents' Day then.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.722
It was a fairly small wedding,
I think 125 people.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.042
But very posh.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.285
The dress was pink lace,
and I'm really very practical,

10:29.480 --> 10:31.801
So I wanted a dress that
I could wear after the wedding

10:31.960 --> 10:33.962
and notjust put in a box.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.327
I still have these shoes

10:36.480 --> 10:40.804
sixty...
six and a half years later

10:40.960 --> 10:43.361
They were pale pink satin.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.204
They're back in style.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.330
If you hang around long enough,
everything comes back.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.247
This is ma and pa and moi.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.970
No siblings.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.969
There's Carl.
So gallant.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.282
There was something about her

11:05.440 --> 11:08.410
that just got into me.

11:08.840 --> 11:09.966
It's always there.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.488
Aw, my little pussycat.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.082
And I figured he was cool
and he was cuddly,

11:15.240 --> 11:18.050
and he cooked Chinese,
so I couldn't do any better.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.086
But it's been one trip,

11:37.240 --> 11:39.049
beautiful trip.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.729
I trained him well.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.645
And if she wants a child,
I'm it.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.210
He's a handful.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.131
The first piece I ever bought
was in Greenwich Village.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.451
I was about maybe 11,
12 years old.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.043
There was a little shop
in a basement

12:10.200 --> 12:12.407
of one of those old-fashioned
kind of tenement houses

12:12.560 --> 12:15.131
that had
the fire escapes outside,

12:16.080 --> 12:17.650
and I'll never forget
that place

12:17.840 --> 12:20.446
because I thought
it was Aladdin's cave.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.840
There was this little man.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.207
His name was Mr. Darris,

12:24.800 --> 12:27.087
and he was threadbare
but elegant.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.641
He always wore spats
and a monocle...

12:32.800 --> 12:34.848
and I always tell everybody
he treated me

12:35.000 --> 12:36.604
like I was a mini duchess.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.762
I'd come in,
and he never seen a kid

12:38.920 --> 12:40.922
be so interested
in all this junk before.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.923
I fixed on a brooch.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.686
I just thought
it was the cat's pajamas,

12:45.840 --> 12:47.763
and I really lusted
after that piece.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.810
So I finally saved up 65 cents,

12:50.960 --> 12:52.405
and we haggled a little bit
over the piece.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.891
I thought it'd be gone,

12:54.080 --> 12:56.048
but fortunately for me,
it was still there.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.771
Anyway, I bought it for
the magnificent sum of 65 cents.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.930
He gave it to me.
I was so thrilled, my God.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.607
You comfortable?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.962
Yeah, fine.
ls it hard for you to do this?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.327
Is it difficult?

13:09.480 --> 13:11.005
No, not at all.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.729
Honey, this is Harlem,
nothing's difficult.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.242
Now this is...
there's a lot of African stuff,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.681
- but the jewelry's great, Iris.
- Oh, let me see.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.922
- Shall we go in? Okay.
- Oh, absolutely.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.205
See, something white with...

13:27.360 --> 13:29.169
Yeah, those are all,
like, jackets.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.560
We'll go around there.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.844
I've always said that
the population of Harlem

13:33.040 --> 13:34.565
has much more style
than they do...

13:34.720 --> 13:36.324
downtown,
they think they're stylish,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.289
but they all were black,
you know?

13:38.440 --> 13:41.171
It's not really style.
It's a uniform.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.324
I used to come up here
on Sundays when I was a kid

13:44.480 --> 13:46.403
and watch all the ladies
going to church.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.607
Yeah, Sunday best.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.768
And they had real style,
I thought.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.763
And that sort of style
never goes out.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.242
No, no, but it doesn't exist
much anymore.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.209
But, you know, things change.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.442
I hope. I hope.
I try.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.168
- That's fun.
- The scarf?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.250
That's like a scarf
or a belt.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.562
Oh, yeah.
How much?

14:11.720 --> 14:12.767
That's 45.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.410
That's a lot.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.450
Careful, Iris,
you're on "Candid Camera."

14:17.600 --> 14:19.011
I'm sorry, I'm cheap.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.403
No! You're not cheap.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.282
It's funny because
you find people think

14:25.440 --> 14:28.762
you just acquire things,
but actually, that's not you.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.251
No, it's hard work.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.289
You really have to put
a lot of effort into it.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.647
I know people who have
wonderful collections,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.404
but it's different.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.602
They go out to buy,
they go to...

14:38.760 --> 14:40.524
Auctions and things
like that, yeah.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.650
But everything I have,
I go out and find,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.802
- which is not easy.
- No.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.407
- I like that.
- That's beautiful.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.484
I like it.
The color, everything.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.723
So, monsieur,
how much are these ones?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.087
Okay, the bracelet ten.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.811
What I'll do, I'm going
to make you a deal.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.321
We know you, okay?

15:02.480 --> 15:07.327
Uh, take... I'll give you
$7 each for you.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.960
And what can you do
on the coat?

15:10.120 --> 15:13.169
The coat, we sell...
normal, we sell 125.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.651
But I'll
let you have it 100.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.962
- Okay.
- I know you.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.088
I know you, queen.
We know you.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.447
You can do better than 100.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.961
- And the bag?
- This 85.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.327
- Oh, you can do better.
- No, this 85.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.609
You see, the tanner
took one day to make it.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.207
- He's slow.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.082
How did you get that?
I can't get those prices.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.526
Oh, I'm very good.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.445
I know.
flaughs)

15:43.240 --> 15:45.846
Doing something creative,
taking your mind off things,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.765
but that's how you shop,
and that's how you dress,

15:48.920 --> 15:50.809
and that's how you think,
in that way.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.769
Oh, yes,
I mean, it's fun.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.651
Sometimes I really
don't feel well.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.326
And I get in there,
it's like I'm 19 1/2.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.689
I'm jumping around
and everything, and I'm so up.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.083
When I crawl back to the car...

16:05.240 --> 16:09.211
- I got my booty...
- How often do you need the fix?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.687
Oh, I'd like to have it
more often than I get it.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.205
Like how often, Iris,
once a week?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.488
- Oh, I would love it once a week.
- Yeah.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.490
I think what fascinates
me about Iris

16:22.640 --> 16:26.326
is that she's the perfect
example of the intersection

16:26.480 --> 16:30.530
of fashion
and interior design and art.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.843
She's been exposed
to so many different areas

16:34.000 --> 16:36.207
of creative worlds from being
an interior designer

16:36.360 --> 16:38.044
to being involved
with Old World Weavers,

16:38.200 --> 16:41.647
and Old World Weavers,
for those who aren't aware,

16:41.800 --> 16:46.089
is this iconic company
that Stark then bought,

16:46.240 --> 16:49.369
but their fabrics are in
some of the finest houses

16:49.520 --> 16:52.126
that we photograph, you know,
still on a daily basis.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.402
When we started
Old World Weavers, it came...

16:54.560 --> 16:55.925
it was a crazy way, too.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.684
We never intended to go
into the fabric bus...

16:57.840 --> 16:59.490
Nothing I ever did
I intended to do.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.404
Everything
just kind of happened.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.564
She had a very
big decorating business.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.324
I would go along with her.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.290
I'd take my little toolbox,
hang the pictures.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.886
And I got a kick
out of watching her

17:12.040 --> 17:14.361
make something beautiful.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.887
One day, I was looking
for a fabric that didn't exist.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.167
I was doing a house,
and I wanted something special,

17:20.319 --> 17:23.926
and then I remembered
that I had gone to school

17:24.079 --> 17:25.969
with a young lady whose father

17:26.119 --> 17:29.169
was supposed to be
a great weaver.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.684
And I happened to run into her,
as luck would have it,

17:32.840 --> 17:36.208
and she said, "Why don't you go
over to the mill and see Papa?"

17:36.360 --> 17:38.089
So I did, and I brought
the design,

17:38.280 --> 17:39.930
and he made it,
and it was a big success.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.610
Everybody liked it.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.569
And he said did I have
any more designs?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.451
So after a while,
he asked if Carl and I

17:46.600 --> 17:49.126
would be interested in going
into business with him.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.964
And I thought
it would be fun.

17:51.120 --> 17:56.331
We did exact reproductions
of 17th, 18th, 19th,

17:56.480 --> 18:00.690
and early 20th Century fabrics,
and I would do my best

18:00.840 --> 18:04.242
to get them to be as close
as possible to the original.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.164
That's why we traveled
so much

18:06.320 --> 18:09.324
because there is no one or two
mills that can do everything.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.363
It's all very specialized.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.850
They had done a lot of work
for different administrations

18:15.000 --> 18:16.525
in the White House
and restored fabrics

18:16.680 --> 18:18.011
and created special fabrics.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.807
Well, uh... Barry...

18:21.960 --> 18:23.530
the White House.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.523
Was that from Barry...

18:25.680 --> 18:27.011
We started when Truman
was here.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.525
I know,
but how did they come...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.444
I don't know,
they heard about us.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.365
You see, the White House
has a fine arts commission.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.841
Well, now,
can you make these changes

18:36.000 --> 18:39.049
according to your own
personal tastes and desires?

18:39.200 --> 18:42.204
Well, no,
I have a committee...

18:42.360 --> 18:44.931
Oh, we had a problem
with Jackie.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.048
Stop.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.089
We're not supposed to talk
too much about the White House.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.561
They get very upset.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.121
My God, we did
so many restorations

18:54.320 --> 18:56.163
in so many different museums.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.840
I remember
I did Stephen Foster's

18:59.000 --> 19:00.843
- My Old Kentucky Home.
- Did the Senate.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.048
I did the Statehouse
in Mississippi.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.084
Every great house
in America had our stuff.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.208
I had a very
interesting clientele.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.442
They didn't want to have things
that everybody else had,

19:10.600 --> 19:13.126
so that started me traveling,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.123
and I went twice a year
to Europe.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.691
I was a busy bee.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.286
And I would wear
three cameras.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.727
I had a Nikon with a telly,

19:47.880 --> 19:52.329
a Nikon normal,
and a Nikon wide-angle.

19:52.480 --> 19:56.201
And the situations
would come up so fast,

19:56.360 --> 19:59.489
I didn't have time
to change lenses.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.291
So it was easier to have
the three cameras.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.090

they'd open up places for us
like you never saw before.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.885
They open at a certain hour,

20:23.040 --> 20:24.804
and they close
at a certain hour.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.089
Who do you think
was the last one? Iris.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.771
I don't like to haggle
too much,

20:34.960 --> 20:36.610
and I don't like to haggle
like some people do.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.491
You have to know where to haggle
and when to haggle.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.802
There are certain places
in the world

20:41.960 --> 20:43.962
where you do a disservice
to the merchant

20:44.120 --> 20:45.451
if you don't haggle.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.881
If he says,
"This piece is $50,"

20:48.040 --> 20:50.964
and you give him $50,
you have totally ruined his day

20:51.120 --> 20:53.600
because he thinks, oh, my God,
if you're stupid enough

20:53.760 --> 20:55.888
to give me $50,
right off the bat,

20:56.040 --> 20:57.929
I should have asked you 150.

Starks made an offer
we couldn't refuse,

in show business

23:40.200 --> 23:42.567
who are obliged
to look young or something,

23:42.720 --> 23:44.563
but everybody knows
how old you are,

23:44.720 --> 23:46.449
and then you have the
scrawny old hands

23:46.600 --> 23:48.887
that don't go with your face,

23:49.040 --> 23:51.964
and some people start
to fall down.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.168
L... No.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.005
I first met Iris
when a friend

24:42.160 --> 24:45.960
who is an appraiser said,

24:46.120 --> 24:48.361
"l've just met a woman
with the most remarkable

24:48.520 --> 24:51.603
collection
of couture costume jewelry.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.327
She probably has
one of the two best collections

24:55.480 --> 24:56.527
in the United States."

24:56.720 --> 24:58.131
That was the beginning.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.009
I was working at F.l.T.
at the time,

25:00.160 --> 25:04.449
and she was one of the great
lenders to our exhibitions

25:04.600 --> 25:07.331
at F.l.T., the Fashion Institute
of Technology.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.603
So we became friends,
and I saw her socially,

25:10.760 --> 25:12.683
and even after we started
at the Met,

25:12.840 --> 25:15.366
there was occasion
to borrow from her.

25:15.520 --> 25:20.731
We had a show that was planned,
and at the very last minute,

25:20.880 --> 25:23.611
there was something that
happened that it couldn't be...

25:23.760 --> 25:26.161
We couldn't proceed,
and it was very late.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.402
It was in the early summer.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.403
And I thought, well,

25:30.560 --> 25:32.847
we have to do a show
for the fall,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.604
and what could it be?

25:34.800 --> 25:38.441
I thought, you know, Iris
has this renowned collection

25:38.640 --> 25:42.611
of costume jewelry that'll
be relatively easy to set up.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.205
Why don't we do that?

25:44.360 --> 25:46.328
As I was talking to her,
it occurred to me

25:46.520 --> 25:48.568
we could do
something really fun.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.961
Because instead
of having the jewelry

25:51.120 --> 25:54.966
on these abstract mounts,
what we could do

25:55.120 --> 25:58.329
is style them in a way
that they were Iris.

25:58.480 --> 26:02.201
He said, "l think it would make
a much more interesting show

26:02.360 --> 26:03.930
if you could show
the public

26:04.120 --> 26:05.724
what you can do
with accessories.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.565
How they can transform
an outfit.

26:08.720 --> 26:13.169
Could you possibly spare
about five outfits?

26:13.320 --> 26:17.245
You would have 100% authority
to accessorize them

26:17.400 --> 26:18.970
any way you saw fit."

26:19.120 --> 26:20.485
So I said, "Oh,
that sounds like fun.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.409
What would you like?"

26:22.600 --> 26:25.206
"Well, we don't know.
What have you got?"

26:25.360 --> 26:27.601
And that opened
the Pandora's box.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.761
When you think
about Iris' collection,

26:33.920 --> 26:35.843
several rooms in her
Park Avenue apartment

26:36.000 --> 26:37.604
are dedicated to her clothes.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.285
Her closets
are double height.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.684
That means two levels
of clothing jammed together

26:43.840 --> 26:46.366
where you'll just see a sliver
of a Saint Laurent skirt

26:46.520 --> 26:47.760
or an Ungaro blouse.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.610
Lagerfeld piece.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.285
Dior.

26:51.640 --> 26:52.766
Galanos.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.166
This is a shaman...

26:54.320 --> 26:58.723
It's a Chinese shaman's...
jacket

26:58.880 --> 27:00.530
But I'll wear it
as a cocktail outfit

27:00.720 --> 27:01.960
with skinny pants.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.248
She had
her mother's apartment,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.528
which was filled
with clothing.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.331
She had her apartment
in Palm Beach,

27:09.520 --> 27:11.409
which was filled with clothing.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.643
And so even for the person
who's put it together,

27:14.800 --> 27:19.567
you know, what point
do you select this over that?

27:20.320 --> 27:23.051
We knew that this
was going to be a show

27:23.240 --> 27:25.686
that looked like nothing else
we had ever done.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.251
They were very much afraid

27:27.400 --> 27:31.121
because they had never done
a one-woman show ever.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.044
It was like a written law.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.248
If you're one-woman show
and you were not in the trade,

27:35.400 --> 27:36.640
you ought to be dead.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.410
Because
the previous exhibition

27:38.560 --> 27:41.325
had fallen apart
and there was no sponsorship,

27:41.480 --> 27:43.164
we had to make it
very close to the vest.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.641
There was not
a lot of publicity.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.086
It would have to be
word-of-mouth.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.005
We didn't expect
that it would be

27:50.160 --> 27:52.288
quite the phenomenon
that it was.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.486
I don't know if there's been
any other show

28:02.640 --> 28:04.802
that has relied so much
on word-of-mouth.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.405
That's what surprised us,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.767
people coming in
and leaving and saying,

28:08.920 --> 28:10.251
"You have to see this show."

28:10.400 --> 28:12.129
The response was remarkable.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.401
I went back numerous times.
It was absolutely fascinating.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.291
And then I'd overhear people...
the comments people made.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.487
On a rare occasion,

28:25.680 --> 28:27.728
I would comment
on their comments.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.451
He'd tell me that people
would say, you know,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.087
"Well, who is she?"

28:32.160 --> 28:33.650
And they'd say, "Oh,
I don't know, she's dead."

28:33.800 --> 28:35.962
So I told them,
"The next time you hear that,

28:36.120 --> 28:38.646
tap the lady on the shoulder
and say,

28:38.800 --> 28:40.564
'My auntie is very much alive.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.530
She's just walking around
to save funeral expenses."'

28:43.680 --> 28:46.524
J' New York,
New York, New York J'

28:47.880 --> 28:49.723
J' Rock, shake to the beat J'

28:49.880 --> 28:51.928
J' Rock,
shake in the streets J'

28:52.120 --> 28:55.602
J' New York, New York,
New Yo-o-rk J'

28:55.760 --> 28:57.649
These are mostly from Tibet.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.251
They weigh a ton.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.529
I wear them only
when I'm assured

29:02.680 --> 29:04.728
that I can go home
in about half an hour.

29:04.880 --> 29:09.010
Well, that's supposed to be me
atop this ostrich.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.845
The jacket is made
of barnyard feathers.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.650
I think it was
in American Vogue

29:13.800 --> 29:15.768
that I saw the first thing
about Iris.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.968
I think that for her, also,
the exhibition at the Met

29:18.120 --> 29:20.248
was a very big change
in her life.

29:20.440 --> 29:24.047
And I'm an octogenarian starlet.
I think that's fun.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.400
J' See happy people dancing
to the funky New York beat J'

29:29.560 --> 29:31.528
I began to be,
in a small way,

29:31.680 --> 29:33.125
a public person.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.011
I mean, I was always known
in the trade,

29:36.160 --> 29:40.643
in my interior design,
and called upon for quotes

29:40.840 --> 29:44.208
and written about, but, I mean,
not to the degree...

29:44.360 --> 29:46.488
I mean,
this was an avalanche.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.880
J' Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
New York J'

29:53.040 --> 29:54.849
I think part of the reason
they responded to it

29:55.000 --> 29:57.287
was this feeling
that it was play.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.485
Here was somebody who was just
having a great deal of fun.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.369
Life is gray and dull,

30:03.520 --> 30:05.045
and you might as well have
a little fun when you dress

30:05.240 --> 30:06.605
and amuse people.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.569
Do you like that?
Did you hear what she said?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.927
Yeah.
flaughs)

30:16.040 --> 30:18.247
The show changed
a lot as it moved.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.643
The next show in Palm Beach
just flowed.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.410
There were seven
contiguous galleries,

30:23.560 --> 30:25.562
and you walked
from one to another.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.489
Then I went to the museum
on Long Island,

30:27.640 --> 30:29.688
in Nassau County,

30:29.840 --> 30:31.842
and then Peabody Essex
was really the climax.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.961
It was really beautiful

30:33.040 --> 30:36.203
because they have huge,
soaring ceilings,

30:36.360 --> 30:37.885
and they did
a really great job.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.530
I'm sure that the reason
my shows were so successful

30:44.680 --> 30:48.730
was that they provided fantasy
or it provided some glamour.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.006
There are a lot
of explanations.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.249
Maybe people caught up with me.
Maybe I was too far ahead.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.607
Maybe people
are looking for something

30:55.760 --> 30:59.242
that's missing in their lives,
because as much as people say

30:59.400 --> 31:00.731
they don't want to be bothered,

31:00.920 --> 31:02.809
I think
they really yearn for it.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.923
J' I love New York J'

31:05.080 --> 31:07.048
J' I love New York... J'

31:31.560 --> 31:33.961
Your audience
is waiting over here.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.609
I've never seen someone
look better

31:43.760 --> 31:45.649
in a pair ofjeans
than Iris.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.365
I know, I've been
watching her for years.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.329
It's nice to meet you.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.084
Jenna wants to meet you.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.322
Jenna's the president
of J. Crew.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.164
Oh!

31:55.320 --> 31:57.209
You are the most chic,
most beautiful,

31:57.360 --> 31:58.805
most incredible woman
I have ever seen.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.201
I've been such a fan of yours
for so many years.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.725
It's such an honor to meet you.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.803
Well, thank you,
I'm so impressed to meet you.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.769
Oh, please, please.
Oh, I mean...

32:06.920 --> 32:09.400
Not even close.
It's an honor.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.561
Thank you.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.964
And the accessory designer
of the year is Alexander Wang.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.484
And right here, guys.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.642
Hold up the award
and straight ahead this way.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.040
It's a pleasure to meet you.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.361
Great meeting you, too.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.488
- I'm a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.840
You look so good tonight.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.365
Thank you, my goodness.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.370
From a handsome
young fella, wow.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.603
I think people
can't even imagine

32:47.760 --> 32:50.923
having that kind of a life
that she has,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.128
and she loves
every fucking minute,

32:53.320 --> 32:55.322
and even if she's
complaining about it,

32:55.480 --> 32:57.244
which he does every single time
I talk to her...

32:57.400 --> 32:59.562
She'll say, "Oh, my God,
I'm so exhausted,"

32:59.720 --> 33:01.722
Like, the conversations
are the same.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.521
It's like I'll call her,
she'll be like, "l'm so tired.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.570
I was just on TV, and then
I'm doing another interview."

33:08.720 --> 33:10.643
And I'm like,
"lris, you love it."

33:10.840 --> 33:11.887
She's like, "l don't love it."

33:11.960 --> 33:13.200
I'm like,
"No, Iris, you love it."

33:13.360 --> 33:16.284
She's like, "l kind of like it."
flaughs)

33:18.440 --> 33:19.965
Oh, wow.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.330
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, that's great.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.123
Oh, I love it.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.850
That's terrific.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.482
Oh, how good he is.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.250
Terrific.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.364
He takes good care of me.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.961
Then take a picture of Desi
taking a picture.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.121
Iris became one
of my favorite models,

34:11.280 --> 34:13.647
and so I said,
"Well, Iris,

34:13.800 --> 34:15.370
I've got to photograph you
at your house."

34:15.520 --> 34:17.761
So I went over to their place
in Palm Beach,

34:17.920 --> 34:20.730
and their apartment
was like this total trip.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.451
It was like a fantasy,
all these little games

34:23.600 --> 34:26.001
and things and animals
that barked...

34:26.159 --> 34:27.491
Dogs that bark, you know?

34:27.639 --> 34:29.641
That's Gussie.
Gussie is a bar.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.007
Her wing goes up,

34:32.159 --> 34:34.969
and her belly
is full of booze.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.925
And Kermit decided
he'd like to live here,

34:39.080 --> 34:41.081
and he's become
a terrible lush.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.719
See how tipsy he is?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.370
And these are
some of my Kachinas.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.449
I've had a number
of museum shows with them.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.443
These are some
of the little teddy bears.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.728
I like him.
He's from the Ritz in Paris.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.689
Stay there, boy.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.207
We used to go
to Santa Fe every summer.

35:01.360 --> 35:05.046
And many, many years ago,
I started to buy this kid

35:05.200 --> 35:07.567
when he was maybe 14 years old
and starting.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.324
He's a Navajo,

35:10.040 --> 35:12.691
and his sister used to help him
dress the figures.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.962
I used to buy one or two
every year,

35:15.360 --> 35:17.010
and when I took them all out,
I never realized

35:17.160 --> 35:19.891
this kid is hung up
on transportation

35:20.040 --> 35:22.361
Because every one of these
is going someplace.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.049
They keep
the Christmas ornaments,

35:31.200 --> 35:34.090
the Christmas lights on
for almost six to eight months,

35:34.240 --> 35:36.561
so it's kind of always Christmas
there.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.165
All aboard!

35:45.280 --> 35:47.487
Did you ever see
Christmas trains?

35:47.560 --> 35:48.561
Pardon?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.768
Did you ever see
Christmas trains before?

35:50.960 --> 35:52.086
No, no.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.167
It's the most perfect house
for two children.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.726
All right.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.442
Okay, we'll speak
in the morning.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.285
Thank you.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.407
They throw out
more food than I ever saw.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.846
There's no more?
There's still another one.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.331
It's not my yogurt.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.124
- Huh?
- It's not mine.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.087
Then get two.
Two is more than enough.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.131
Okay, have a good day.
Yeah.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.520
Thanks, David.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.365
You like this Carl?

37:31.920 --> 37:33.843
- Yeah.
- Huh?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.843
- It's De La Renta.
- Huh?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.002
De La Renta
Do you like it?

37:39.160 --> 37:41.003
Oscar should like it.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.606
Do you like it?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.489
What's not to like?

37:46.320 --> 37:48.163
Money, money, money.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.726
J' That's where my money goes,
to buy my baby's clothes J'

37:52.880 --> 37:55.963
Oh, well.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.682
Either that or Uncle Sam.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.526
Rather give it to her.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.082
- Isn't this fabulous?
- What?

38:03.240 --> 38:05.891
- Look at this.
- That's wild.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.326
I love this the best.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.209
That's a fun thing.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.966
I'll take this one.
Should I get the other one?

38:14.120 --> 38:15.360
- Huh?
- You like the other one?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.891
Yes, dear.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.124
I like the poor bastard
there on the back.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.680
You never know what's going to
happen with this child.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.161
Surprise, surprise.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.001
It's very good.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.443
It's not a dull marriage,
I can tell you that.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.691
Come, let's walk.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.089
How much?

38:43.840 --> 38:45.683
$2?

38:46.240 --> 38:47.571
Is this yours?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.765
I wonder if they have
any long-sleeve.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.130
That's fun.
That's fun.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.409
It's $30, though,
and it doesn't look good on you.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.971
Doesn't look good?
Okay?

39:06.120 --> 39:07.360
This one.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.366
He likes that.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.761
- Like it?
- I love it.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.845
Make a deal.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.567
Make a deal.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.131
Make a deal, McNeal.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.086
ls it heavy?

39:24.240 --> 39:27.528
Not bad, no.
It's all right, sweetheart.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.489
I'm getting used to it.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.963
You have to pay
for being stylish.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.361
It doesn't affect
my brainpower.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.887
Oh, could you order me...
because I have...

39:50.040 --> 39:51.644
the Wall Street Journal?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.689
Yeah, because there's
a piece about me.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.491
Day in the life of.
Okay? Thank you.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.484
- And that's for Saturday only?
- Right, thank you, thank you.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.040
Hello?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.729
It's Iris Apfel.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.291
I'm in Palm Beach.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.050
Yes, yes, we had our interview
this morning.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.362
Monday, we'll be
all day at the doctor's.

40:25.520 --> 40:30.003
We have to go for a whole bunch
of eye tests.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.006
How many phone calls do
you think Iris gets in a day?

40:33.200 --> 40:37.649
Oh, Lord,
sometimes about 50 or more.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.404
I mean, back to back,

40:39.560 --> 40:41.961
the cell ringing and
the house phone ringing.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.202
You can't keep up
with this phone, you can't.

40:46.760 --> 40:47.966
You got something.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.003
Where's my phone?

40:51.160 --> 40:52.491
Oh.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.045
J' Fly me to the moon J'

41:05.200 --> 41:06.690
- Take that hat off him.
- No!

41:06.840 --> 41:08.444
It's a terrible hat.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.285
What's the matter
with the hat?

41:11.920 --> 41:14.446
Iris, the hat's holding
my head on straight.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.762
Oh, excuse me.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.971
J' What's it all about, Alfie? J'

41:23.560 --> 41:25.449
Your voice is worse than mine.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.601
Nezzie has a beautiful voice.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.604
This is Nezzie.
She's the chief of this house.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.002
Look at her slippers
she makes.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.001
Very talented wife.
I think I'll keep her.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.449
Trade-in value's not so high.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.807
Trade-in value's not so high.
flaughs)

41:50.960 --> 41:52.086
Oh, well.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.923
Have all your things set up.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.611
These are how many minutes
we're spending on each item.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.127
- Mm-hmm, may I sit down?
- Yes, you may.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.288
- Those are drop-dead.
- Yeah.

42:31.720 --> 42:35.008
That looks good.
I like these together.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.970
Everybody like these
together?

42:39.160 --> 42:40.571
See, if you do
something like this,

42:40.720 --> 42:42.370
it starts to get a look.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.762
Looks good.
We'll take that picture.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.122
And then just one last thing,
and then we're done.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.089
I think that's
such a great scarf.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.969
Mm-hmm, it's fun.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.770
- All your stuff is fun.
- Well, thank you.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.684
- Everybody loves it.
- Yeah.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.321
Stand by.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.209
Well, good morning.

43:03.360 --> 43:07.604
She is here, the rare bird
herself of fashion,

43:07.760 --> 43:11.287
the icon herself,
Iris Apfel.

43:11.480 --> 43:15.610
Over 75 years of all of that
influence in the fashion world,

43:15.760 --> 43:18.889
interior designing,
accessories

43:19.040 --> 43:22.522
exclusive to you on HSN,
and it is such a treat.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.444
That's so nice to hear.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.841
Makes a girl feel like
there's still a chance.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.407
Flaughs)
Definitely.

43:29.560 --> 43:34.646
So tell us about these again.
You don't do anything petite.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.330
NO' no' no' no' no!

43:36.480 --> 43:39.324
I like big and bold
and lots of pizzazz.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.881
And it's about color coming
into the season, isn't it?

43:42.040 --> 43:44.088
Absolutely,
color is so important.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.083
I mean,
color can raise the dead.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.811
For many of us, you give
us the freedom, you know,

43:48.960 --> 43:50.485
step out of the box
a little bit.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.244
That's what life is all about.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.851
If you're just going
to sit there

43:54.000 --> 43:55.650
and do the same damn thing
all the time,

43:55.800 --> 43:57.643
you might as well
jump into the box yourself.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.849
Flaughs)
Exac... you heard it here.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.207
Flaughs)
It's exactly right.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.721
Did we sell well?

44:07.880 --> 44:09.370
You know, I don't know.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.045
I was watching.
I wasn't looking at the numbers.

44:11.200 --> 44:14.283
- How did it go?
- You looked fantastic.

44:14.440 --> 44:17.842
My computer kept
freezing up on me, but...

44:18.000 --> 44:20.287
- But you looked fantastic.
- Well, thank you.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.681
Thank you, great job.
Thank you.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.808
And it sold out.
You can't wear it any more.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.281
This one did?
I'm wearing it.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.884
Hi, I'm going in style.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.128
In the '40s, I was probably

44:38.320 --> 44:40.891
the first woman to wearjeans.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.042
All of a sudden,
I had a vision.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.004
I said I wouldn't it be
wonderful

44:45.200 --> 44:47.567
if I had a big gingham...
this sounds crazy.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.927
It was.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.885
A big gingham...
a big gingham turban

44:53.080 --> 44:56.687
and very large hoop earrings
that I could wear

44:56.880 --> 45:00.965
with a nice crisp shirt
and blue jeans?

45:01.120 --> 45:03.885
They said to me,
"Don't you know

45:04.040 --> 45:06.088
young ladies
do not wearjeans?

45:06.240 --> 45:07.685
What's wrong with you?"

45:07.840 --> 45:09.922
And I said, "But I want a pair.
I need a pair."

45:10.080 --> 45:12.287
"Well, we're very sorry.
We can't help you."

45:12.480 --> 45:15.086
Well, they were just so mean.
They threw me out.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.971
But when I want something,
I'm like a dog with a bone,

45:18.120 --> 45:19.565
so I went back.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.484
I went back
a couple of times,

45:21.640 --> 45:24.450
and finally,
I guess in an effort

45:24.600 --> 45:26.728
just to get me off his back,

45:26.880 --> 45:29.201
the owner called me
on the telephone...

45:29.360 --> 45:31.567
Oh, it was maybe about
five or six weeks

45:31.720 --> 45:33.484
of really hard work
on my part...

45:33.640 --> 45:36.564
And he said
he had mail-order...

45:36.720 --> 45:40.281
had mail ordered me
a pair of boy's jeans,

45:40.440 --> 45:42.204
and they fit.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.886
So I put the outfit together,
and it was really smashing.

45:45.040 --> 45:46.166
It really was.

45:46.320 --> 45:49.608
Do you think, Iris, like,
for you, did...

45:49.760 --> 45:52.161
Because for me,
I became confident

45:52.320 --> 45:54.243
once I, like,
pretended I was

45:54.400 --> 45:57.165
and forced myself into wearing
things I was shy about.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.926
Did it come after
for you or...

46:00.080 --> 46:02.082
I can't remember
that far back.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.689
Hey, sweetheart,
you look beautiful as ever.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.808
Thank you.
I'm vertical, so I'm so happy.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.764
Oh.
flaughs)

46:19.960 --> 46:21.564
You know why I think
you did this film?

46:21.720 --> 46:23.529
- Why?
- Because he's very handsome,

46:23.680 --> 46:25.523
and I think
you really had a crush on him.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.484
- Everybody does.
- I know.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.365
Remember the evening
we went to that party,

46:30.520 --> 46:32.841
and there were a number
of elderly ladies,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.243
and they were like...
all over Albert.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.210
- Yeah.
- My God. He was like a magnet.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.607
Uaughs)

46:41.760 --> 46:45.401
Isn't it amazing now
how many designers don't sew?

46:45.560 --> 46:47.608
They don't sew.
They don't drape.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.684
- They're media freaks.
- Right, exactly, yeah.

46:50.840 --> 46:53.081
It's unbelievable.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.686
See, these new kids
go to the vintage shows,

46:55.840 --> 46:59.049
and they buy a few pieces,
and they change a button or two,

46:59.200 --> 47:01.362
and they knock it off,
and it's crazy.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.761
Theyjust have no sense
of history

47:03.960 --> 47:06.008
and no curiosity
about anything.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.049
When you were, like,
growing up,

47:08.200 --> 47:11.283
didn't you have a sense
of history just from reading

47:11.440 --> 47:12.805
- and looking at things...
- Oh, of course.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.325
Listening to music
and everything?

47:14.480 --> 47:18.246
I had a great sense of history,
and I realized

47:18.400 --> 47:20.641
that everything
is interrelated

47:20.800 --> 47:24.805
and that politics and science
and economics and fashion

47:24.960 --> 47:26.610
and all that are one
and part of the same,

47:26.760 --> 47:30.651
and I applied it...
I know if you look at a dress,

47:30.800 --> 47:33.485
it's affected
by all those things.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.849
I mean, you can almost tell what
was going on at that period.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.247
You know,
I've never heard you say,

47:39.400 --> 47:40.925
"l don't like the way
that person dresses."

47:41.080 --> 47:43.401
- I can't sit in judgment.
- Right, exactly.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.005
- It's not my business.
- Right.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.571
If they're happy that way...
you know,

47:46.720 --> 47:48.609
It's better to be happy
than well-dressed.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.883
Flaughs)
Exactly. That's so great.

48:08.280 --> 48:09.566
Nice.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.246
- Hi.
- There she is.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.209
Hi.
Oh, how cute.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.249
Welcome, you're so...

48:41.560 --> 48:44.245
Okay, Iris,
after this is all laid out,

48:44.440 --> 48:46.681
I am officiallyjealous.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.047
I have a lot
of catching up to do.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.123
- No, I mean...
- This is a drop in the bucket.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.045
Okay, so Iris and everybody,
can I tell you what we set up?

48:56.240 --> 48:57.287
All the accessories are here.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.283
All the shoes
are down on the floor.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.647
I'm not sure if we're going to
get that far, but they're there.

49:01.800 --> 49:05.247
We dressed several mannequins
here with almost everything...

49:05.400 --> 49:07.368
Right behind you.
...almost everything.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.649
- This one I...
- You tell us what to do.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.571
And this I thought
with the brown pants.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.888
- The brown pants?
- Yeah, that's so you don't...

49:16.040 --> 49:18.281
- You don't see anything else.
- Okay.

49:18.440 --> 49:22.843
And then I have some jewelry.
And I have those Missoni shoes.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.169
And then I put this...

49:28.640 --> 49:30.005
- That on top of that?
- Yeah.

49:30.160 --> 49:33.846
Oh, that's the secret for
how you get some of your depth.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.802
Beautiful, so sculptural.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.847
- It spoils the...
- The line of the jacket?

49:39.960 --> 49:41.041
- Yeah.
- Okay.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.485
Is she dragging it?

49:42.640 --> 49:45.086
Yeah, that's what I mean,
something like that.

49:45.240 --> 49:46.480
Dragging it along kind of?

49:46.640 --> 49:47.641
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I love that.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.531
- Because we can do that.
- That's what I meant.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.921
We like that kind of rhythm
anyway to break it up.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.401
So it'll go down here,
okay.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.484
- We think on the same beam.
- See?

50:00.680 --> 50:02.967
We could do, you know,

50:03.120 --> 50:05.771
glitz and bling
if you wanted to,

50:05.920 --> 50:08.082
or we could just do
this kind of...

50:08.240 --> 50:09.605
Lots and lots of dots, right.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.127
Iris, that looks pretty great.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.607
You know you could do...
maybe want to add this to it?

50:14.760 --> 50:16.489
Oh, I see how this works.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.088
Some people might have assumed
this was just one piece.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.130
- People usually do.
- But no, you're making it.

50:25.280 --> 50:27.362
What you have to do...
see, I used to do things

50:27.520 --> 50:32.890
with antique bits and pieces,
and what I was so proud of

50:33.040 --> 50:34.883
was they looked like
they were born that way.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.849
They didn't look like
they were put together.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.331
I hate when
it looks put together.

50:40.920 --> 50:42.888
Oh, you want this
on the top here.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.246
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.243
Or you think maybe
too much for the window?

50:46.400 --> 50:47.731
No! no! no, "Q, "C.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.609
You know the secret
behind doing windows?

50:49.760 --> 50:52.206
- What, too much?
- No, it's never too much.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.801
You always do
the most outlandish.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.248
Oh, well, that's for me.
You want to give me a job?

50:58.800 --> 51:00.245
Iris,
let me ask you a question.

51:00.400 --> 51:02.687
Do you have glasses to spare?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.604
Well, for the window,
I guess I have a few pairs.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.171
I don't know how many I have.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.687
We were thinking we might
do this sort of thing.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.686
See it, Linda, the mask there?
Might do something like that.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.925
- This is a classic...
- I kind of like the glasses.

51:18.880 --> 51:20.609
The mannequins
could be holding something.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.041
I think it's a little chicer
just with glasses

51:23.200 --> 51:24.850
instead of with...
you know what I mean?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.048
We know it's Iris
just by the glasses.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.565
Let's just...

51:29.240 --> 51:30.685
but these would break, I guess.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.002
Here, I'm not going to
let go of them.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.046
Let's see the...
Let's try this girl here.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.684
Gee, I wonder who this is.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.729
The point of this
is just a little thing.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.770
I wanted to show sort of
all your different jobs,

52:19.920 --> 52:22.491
that you have
more jobs than anyone.

52:24.160 --> 52:27.164
Oh, I love that.
I love that.

52:28.600 --> 52:29.886
Isn't there sound?

52:30.080 --> 52:32.924
How do we tell the man
that there's no sound?

52:33.080 --> 52:34.570
Oh, okay, thanks.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.083
Can you start it over?

52:44.880 --> 52:46.530
We have something
really big for you

52:46.720 --> 52:48.006
- to surprise you with.
- For me?

52:48.160 --> 52:50.003
- Yes, absolutely.
- Oh, wow.

52:52.520 --> 52:55.205
There's some noise
coming from the bag.

52:56.120 --> 52:59.681
o“, my God! oh!

52:59.840 --> 53:02.002
So you can use this
to shop with you

53:02.160 --> 53:04.970
when you go to Whole Foods
to buy your forbidden rice.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.446
Oh, that's fabulous!

53:06.600 --> 53:09.251
- That's going to be in the stores.
- No.

53:09.400 --> 53:10.731
- Yeah.
- Big like this?

53:10.880 --> 53:13.406
- Big like this.
- Oh, Albert, look at that.

53:13.560 --> 53:16.325
- Oh, my God.
- We're excited about it.

53:16.480 --> 53:19.211
Oh.

53:19.360 --> 53:22.842
Oh, I can't believe it.
Oh, my God.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.850
I love you, Rory.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.731
You've been so kind
and gracious to me.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.566
My God.

53:29.720 --> 53:31.688
If somebody could
just open the door?

53:31.840 --> 53:33.251
I'll get it.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.081
I heard your other
collection is sold out.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.241
Sold out.

53:39.360 --> 53:42.125
Yeah, the Home Shopping.
Yeah, it was so exciting.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.687
Were you on it yourself
selling it?

53:44.840 --> 53:46.922
I was supposed to,
and I was in the hospital.

53:47.080 --> 53:49.321
Ijust had surgery.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.167
So they asked me
if I would talk,

53:52.320 --> 53:55.688
and I said yes,
and I summoned all my energy,

53:55.840 --> 53:57.046
and I did two shows.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.521
I guess it was about
half an hour each.

54:00.200 --> 54:03.602
And I was very...
You know, it was very exciting,

54:03.800 --> 54:06.326
and the next... for two days,
I couldn't get out of bed

54:06.480 --> 54:08.448
I was so drained.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.404
Carl doesn't know
I had hip surgery.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.329
He doesn't know
my hip was broken.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.687
Really?
How did you do that?

54:14.840 --> 54:16.365
Well, I didn't do it.
Nezzie did.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.528
Because Carl
is very devoted to me,

54:18.680 --> 54:20.808
particularly now that
he isn't feeling well,

54:20.960 --> 54:23.930
and she said if she was going
to stay with him,

54:24.080 --> 54:26.560
she couldn't tell him
because he'd go bananas.

54:26.720 --> 54:29.963
And he really was so upset
that I wasn't at home.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.889
- He knows I fell...
- Where did he think you were?

54:32.080 --> 54:33.366
No, he knows I fell.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.045
He was sleeping
when it happened.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.488
But when he got up...
what was I going to do?

54:38.640 --> 54:41.211
I was trying to wait
till the next day,

54:41.360 --> 54:44.921
but the head of NYU,
the head honcho

54:45.080 --> 54:46.844
is a good friend,
and he said, "You're crazy.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.240
You have to come immediately,

54:48.400 --> 54:50.129
and you have to come
in an ambulance."

54:50.840 --> 54:53.161
So I had to call the ambulance,
and I thought, "Oh, my God."

54:53.320 --> 54:54.765
But God was good,

54:54.920 --> 54:57.400
and they sent me
the two most delicious guys.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.843
They were big hunks, but they
were so sweet and so kind.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.721
And I explained the situation,
and they were, you know,

55:04.880 --> 55:07.690
kidding around
with Carl and whatnot,

55:07.840 --> 55:09.205
and they got me out.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.361
He thinks I fell...

55:10.520 --> 55:12.887
He knows I fell
and hurt my leg badly,

55:13.080 --> 55:14.081
but he doesn't know
I broke my hip.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.287
He doesn't know what happened.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.771
So we're always together.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.445
We work together
and everything else,

55:18.600 --> 55:20.284
so he's used
to having me around.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.603
He's older than I am,
well, so it was very sweet.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.205
You're very sweet together.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.521
<i>AnyWaY---</i>

55:34.800 --> 55:36.689
Have you met...
This is the Maysles crew.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.604
- No!
- I'm Katie.

55:38.760 --> 55:41.604
Katie, I'm Nancy.
Nice to meet you.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.206
- Sean.
- Sean, nice to meet you.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.167
And this is Albert Maysles
himself.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.886
Hello, Albert,
so nice to meet you.

55:50.040 --> 55:51.326
You want a nibble?
Help yourself.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.881
- Yes, yes.
- Albert, you want...

55:54.040 --> 55:56.042
I'm okay.
I had some breakfast.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.806
- Sweetie, you want some?
- We're okay, thank you.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.207
Greetings,
and welcome to the launch

56:01.360 --> 56:03.249
of the UT in NYC program.

56:03.400 --> 56:07.291
It is my pleasure
to introduce Mrs. Iris Apfel,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.204
our tour guide
and visiting professor

56:09.360 --> 56:11.203
for the week
in New York City.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.089
Mrs. Apfel?

56:13.240 --> 56:16.323
I have brought you
14 eager students

56:16.480 --> 56:18.050
from the University of Texas.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.964
Good, well, I don't want
to waste any time

56:20.120 --> 56:22.282
because we have
a lot of things to do.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.848
And the reason I chose this
was because I've had occasion

56:26.000 --> 56:28.446
in the last couple of years
to work with students,

56:28.600 --> 56:31.524
which I never did before,
and I find that, unhappily,

56:31.680 --> 56:33.921
they may be very well-trained
in their craft,

56:34.080 --> 56:36.970
but they haven't got a clue
as to the outside world.

56:38.320 --> 56:40.482
So the sage has spoken.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.760
Everybody faints
when they hear the itinerary

56:49.920 --> 56:51.763
because it's really...
I must say,

56:51.920 --> 56:55.402
they're all offbeat fields
like licensing and styling

56:55.560 --> 56:58.086
and things that kids
don't think about as fashion.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.890
They just think
it's not glamorous,

57:00.040 --> 57:01.769
but it's important.

57:01.920 --> 57:05.288
I mean, all the great
handcrafted trades

57:05.480 --> 57:06.606
are going down the tubes.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.489
Some have already gone.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.929
And then there's nobody left
to teach them,

57:11.080 --> 57:15.085
and you'll have all kinds
of machine-made junk.

57:15.280 --> 57:18.489
Listen up, everybody,
this wonderful, wonderful man

57:18.640 --> 57:20.290
is going to talk with you.

57:20.440 --> 57:23.762
He is in my opinion,
and I think not only mine

57:23.960 --> 57:26.964
but everybody else's,
the king of the runway,

57:27.120 --> 57:29.043
and he comes
from a long tradition

57:29.200 --> 57:31.328
of embroiderers and beaders.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.767
So listen, he's going to
tell you wonderful things.

57:33.920 --> 57:37.811
You have to keep your eyes open
for anything and everything.

57:37.960 --> 57:42.409
Like me flying, going to Miami,
I look down from the plane,

57:42.600 --> 57:45.206
and I see fields of...
you know, fields.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.567
It looked like a...
like an amazing pattern.

57:47.720 --> 57:50.769
I drew it up,
and it's in one of my dresses.

57:50.920 --> 57:53.446
Now it's up to you
as a designer.

57:54.320 --> 57:56.049
What are you inspired by?

57:56.240 --> 57:58.322
And I think
whatever feeds you...

57:58.480 --> 57:59.686
You could be curious about math,

57:59.840 --> 58:01.001
you could be curious
about science,

58:01.200 --> 58:02.406
you could be curious
about fashion,

58:02.560 --> 58:03.721
you could be curious
about anything,

58:03.880 --> 58:05.769
but ultimately, what drives you
and makes you better

58:05.960 --> 58:07.325
is learning something
you don't already know.

58:07.480 --> 58:09.767
I could never be
a good friend of anybody

58:09.960 --> 58:12.247
who wasn't curious or didn't
have a sense of humor.

58:12.400 --> 58:15.210
I think those are the two great
gifts that I got in my cradle.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.407
I really believe that.

58:16.560 --> 58:19.484
People always love enthusiasm,
and I think that, in the end,

58:19.680 --> 58:22.411
New York is about work
and getting a job done.

58:22.600 --> 58:25.080
So it's great if you're
a cute girl in a cute dress

58:25.240 --> 58:27.481
and want to be
on the red carpet, but really,

58:27.640 --> 58:30.291
if you mean business,
New York is the place for you.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.481
If you mean business,

58:31.560 --> 58:33.289
people will
take you seriously, I think.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.771
It's very important to me
that my program continue.

58:36.920 --> 58:39.082
It's going gangbusters.

58:39.280 --> 58:43.729
The kids are now fighting to get
in, and the school shows no...

58:43.880 --> 58:46.326
I mean, unless it falls
by the wayside

58:46.480 --> 58:48.164
and they can't get
anymore funding...

58:48.320 --> 58:50.402
I mean,
I can't do this forever,

58:50.560 --> 58:52.324
but I'm sure they'll be able
to get somebody else.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.925
Awesome, thank you.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.447
You never had children.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.369
No, we never wanted to.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.730
I mean, not that I...
but you can't...

59:04.880 --> 59:07.804
I learned a long time ago you
can't have everything,

59:07.960 --> 59:11.009
and I wanted a career,
and I wanted to travel,

59:11.160 --> 59:13.527
and my mother...
I know how much I resented it.

59:13.680 --> 59:15.682
She had stopped for a while,

59:15.840 --> 59:18.491
and then when I was like ten
or 11, she went back,

59:18.640 --> 59:22.850
and I was very upset.
Very upset.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.650
I felt I was...
I mean, it was stupid,

59:24.800 --> 59:26.404
but I felt I was being
abandoned,

59:26.560 --> 59:31.248
so I said I didn't want to have
my child raised by a nanny.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.290
And you can't do everything.
It's impossible.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.484
Something has to give.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.890
And sometimes it's you.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.288
Well, I haven't had a
chance to go through anything.

59:46.440 --> 59:47.521
Yes.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.284
Logistics, logistics.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.804
Okay. There we go.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.771
Galliano's pieces
are fantastic.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.524
Yes.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.247
This is spectacular.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.125
The Peabody Essex Museum
hosted Iris' exhibition

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.363
"The Rare Bird of Fashion"
in, um...

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.646
'09.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.004
And then when the
exhibition came to the museum,

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.730
we invited Iris and Carl,
of course,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.360
to be part
of the installation.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.842
And so I learned
that Peabody

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.447
had a fashion collection,
but it more or less stopped

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.369
at the time that mine begins.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.406
So we decided
that it would be a nice fit,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.245
and that I would,
little by little,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.886
give all the stuff
to the museum.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.042
So we started last year.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.890
They got 80-odd pieces
last year.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.121
Yes, mm-hmm.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.727
Probably get another batch,
and will keep going.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.601
Oh, those are trousers.
Oh, look at that.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.441
Oh, with a matching coat.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.526
What an interesting
color combination.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.563
This is a very personal
collection.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.207
This is mine, and I didn't
buy it to impress anybody.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.362
I bought it
because I liked it.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.722
And I wore almost everything.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.881
Some things I wore to pieces.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.247
This is the green...
This is the green one.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.207
I was collecting
church vestments at one point.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.126
So with this one,
I found a pair.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.965
I took the pair,
and I cut it apart,

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.128
and I made a pair of trousers.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.651
- This has a number.
- What is that?

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.041
It's a black, white,
or blue...

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.407
- With fringe.
- Oh, no, it's dark blue.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.723
Oh, that's a gorgeous fabric.
That is a fabric to die for.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.522
Yeah, as if there aren't other
to-die-for fabrics here.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.801
But this one is very...

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.041
But it's interesting
to see which ones

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.282
you get really excited about.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.367
Look at this.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.722
- Oh, wow.
- It's woven.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.042
It's a velvet
and then the lace, wow.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.851
It's quite the combination.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.844
But look at how it's threaded
up through with the fringe.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.287
Where did you find this?
Here or...

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.284
No, you' don't find
anything like this here.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.842
Somebody once told me,
and it's so true,

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.565
you really don't own
anything while you're here.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.609
You just rent,
so sometimes,

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.967
it might be nicer to
see where it's going

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.841
than to not know who gets it,
so I'm happy to do it.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.241
How do you choose
what to give away?

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.442
It's not easy.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.443
Does it keep you up?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.203
Oh, God, no.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.727
No, I have more important things
to keep me up at night.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.325
No, no.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.403
Well,
now I have to ask what...

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.130
What keeps you up at night?

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.083
Oh, I mean...

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.925
Matters of health
and things like that.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.606
Things
that are really important.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.131
Mm-hmm.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.771
I mean, as you get older,
you realize

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.127
that all these other things
are just...

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.729
Iris,
just looking over here?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.051
How many people have been
in here before, Iris?

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.328
Not too many.
I don't let anybody in here.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.642
Trying to get it
a little organized.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.606
Great.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.724
Uaughs)

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.485
Great.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.244
Do you want me
to hang this somewhere?

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.925
- Just stick it here.
- Okay.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.845
I have two more hangars
of items.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.206
Thank you.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.964
It's a system until a lot
of people stick their noses in,

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.726
and then it gets
all fucked up.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.886
Put it here.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.520
Okay, and then
this J. Crew dress.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.284
- Put it here.
- Okay.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.441
Look at that coat.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.046
Hi.
How are you?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.440
My beautiful child.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.840
How are you, pussycat?

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.561
I made it.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.843
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.490
I don't know.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.648
Somebody's stealing my breath.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.929
Be quiet.
Relax, relax, relax.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.524
What's that cousin's name
with two kids up there?

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.162
Carl, just relax.
Don't talk.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.690
Catch your breath.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.850
My aunt rarely relaxes,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.571
and I think that's kind
of a fault on occasion.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.327
I think sometimes she should
slow down, and I ask her,

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.960
or I kind of even insist,
that she do a little bit,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.691
rests a little bit more,
but it's not her personality.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.644
She's even said
that when she's not busy,

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.080
she can get depressed.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.651
She's not at all
a depressive person,

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.444
but I can understand
that her personality

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.524
is to keep moving,
keep busy, keep occupied,

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.769
keep creative, keep productive,
and that's her life,

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.649
and it has always been
her life.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.244
Oh, I like being active.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.243
I like being in the world
and of the world,

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.483
and everybody has to do it
in his or her own way.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.847
I think I told you this
about my mother's friend.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.202
When you would say,
"How are you feeling today?"

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.249
She'd say,
"Well, to tell you the truth,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.687
when I get up in the morning,
everything I have two of,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.645
one hurts,"
and that's the way it is.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.524
When you're older,
a lot of people

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.126
just give into that,

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.442
but unless it's something
really serious,

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.120
but if it isn't,
you just have to push yourself,

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.805
and then you go out,
and you start to do things,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.325
you forget about yourself.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.249
Otherwise,
you can just sit there

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.164
and brood all day long.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.527
I mean, you cannot do
what you did.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.207
People say what an energy
and everything I have,

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.767
but it's nothing
like what I used to have.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.965
Now I get tired.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.202
I'm ready for the voyage.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.205
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, darling.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.361
How are you?

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.523
I don't know. Vertical.
I'm vertical.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.603
- Where you going?
- Back to work.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.961
Back to work?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.487
Make sure they take it easy
with you, okay?

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.286
- Yeah, they're good people.
- Okay.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.445
Hi.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.080
Okay, we're off and running.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.211
- Right here.
- Right here?

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.930
Yeah, that's the elevator.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.849
Not a friendly policeman.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.371
Hello?

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.561
I had a very
interesting clientele.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.326
They didn't want to be dragged
from showroom to showroom

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.244
and have things
that everybody else had,

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.721
so that started me traveling,

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.809
and I went twice a year
to Europe

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.611
and each time took at least
a 40-foot container

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.804
besides going to all
the auctions and estate sales

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.325
and everything else.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.845
That has to go.
That one goes.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.766
- And, uh, this piece goes.
- That one's going.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.730
Then, uh...
And two more pieces over there.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.406
Oh, a lot of pieces.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.162
I believe this one goes.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.362
That big long bench goes,
yes, yeah.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.808
It wasn't easy
to part with these things

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.970
because they have so many
memories connected with them.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.725
I'm sorry to see them gone,
but c'est la vie.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.604
They don't do me
any good here.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.404
They don't do anybody any good,
and they're so beautiful,

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.608
they might as well brighten
somebody's life,

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.167
and frankly,
I can use a few more shekels.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.721
- This is 750.
- What were you thinking?

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.450
- What?
- What were you thinking?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.246
I don't know.
I have to check. I really do.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.484
Oh, my God.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.928
Oh, my God,
it's one of those panels.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.491
Mm-hmm.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.206
Wait, there was something
I had to show you.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.001
Hmm.
That's really different.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.328
I thought it could be
a wall hanging,

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:25.881
or it could even...
maybe a bed thing

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.770
- because that could tuck under.
- Hang over the bottom?

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.161
Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.279
<i>0K3)!-</i>

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.045
When I didn't know any better

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.929
and we first went to Paris

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.889
years and years ago
right after the war,

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.644
the dealers would say,
"You must come

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.484
early in the morning to my..."
they called them "my box,"

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.849
and you'd have to get there,
like, 4:00 in the morning

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.649
with a big searchlight,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.441
and it was always damp
and cold and miserable.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.968
And we did that for a while,
and then my husband said to me,

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.963
"You know,
this is really stupid.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.441
You don't buy
what other people buy,

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.762
and almost everything you buy,
you always say,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.684
"lt has to have
my name on it.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.890
If it's got your name on it,
baby,

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.008
it's going to be here
at 11:00 in the morning."

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.964
So that's what we continued
to do, and it worked.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.124
I still occasionally miss
that terribly.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.645
It's definitely
the end of an era.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.010
It's the end of another life.
It took me a long time.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.367
You have
to get yourself psyched.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.409
Especially a collection
like that, you know,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.211
every piece has a memory
because most of them

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.091
were bought on trips
or different occasions.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.369
My accountant said to me,
"Just think of all the money

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.205
you would've saved if you
had done this years ago."

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.488
Well,
but I wasn't ready.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.727
I feel that for everything
there is a season.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.369
And I suppose that when I put
the last key in the door,

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.284
I'll go home
and get hysterical.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.807
Right now, I'm managing.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.968
You got a birthday
coming up, huh?

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.203
Yeah, August 4th.
That scares the hell out of me.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.247
What am I going to do
for an encore?

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.289
Ah, me.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.960
Well, if you made it
this far, you can go further,

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.849
that's my idea.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.451
Happy birthday.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.690
You're looking great.
I love your pants.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.531
I can't tell you how happy...

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.042
Dr. Pritchard took care of us
for over 40 years.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.409
Jenna, oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.965
Hi, how are you?

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.088
Happy birthday, kid.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.564
Carl doesn't like
to talk too much,

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.883
so he wants me to say
a word or two or four.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.371
Go ahead.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.091
He wants to thank everybody
for coming.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.651
It's so nice.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.804
We're so pleased
that you're all in our life.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.731
You've been so generous
in sharing

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.446
so many wonderful things
with us all these years.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.286
And Carl feels the same way,
and he's very happy

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.411
to be sailing
into his second century.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.565
And he has...

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.530
He has a word of advice
to the guys.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.082
He says,
in the words of my grandpa,

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.486
"A woman is
as old as she looks,

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.247
but a man is never old
until he stops looking."

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.921
Blow, Carl.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.091
I want to do more things
in this life

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.447
with my child bride.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:46.202
And if the Lord lets me do it,

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.164
I'll sure enjoy it.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.763
Why not?

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.169
You got one trip.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.686
Now, you see?

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.162
She thought
I was getting chilly.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.970
She's right.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.321
I never felt pretty.
I don't feel pretty now.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.602
I'm not a pretty person.
I don't like pretty.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.527
So I don't feel badly,
and I think it worked out well

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.763
because I found
that, for instance,

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.568
all the girls that I know
who were very pretty girls

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.685
and got by on their looks,
as time went on

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.365
and they faded...

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.563
They were nothing.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.802
And they were very,
very disappointed.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.088
When you're somebody
like myself,

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.130
in order to get around
and be attractive,

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.766
you have to develop something,
you have to learn something,

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.684
and you have to do something.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.320
So you become
a bit more interesting.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.888
And when you get older,
you get by on that.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.011
Anyway, I don't happen
to like pretty.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.124
Most of the world
is not with me,

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.009
but I don't care.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.522
Okay, excuse me.
Help yourself.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.245
Have anything you want.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.041
J' Hey J'

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.161
J' Hey J'

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.206
J' Hey J'

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.451
J' Hey J'

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.966
J' Hey J'

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.721
J' Hey J'

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:05.761
J' Hey J'

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.569
J' Hey J'

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.085
Okay, you readY?

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.925
This is
your Halloween costume.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.321
Can you see?

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.690
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Poor children.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.411
Look at that.
How crazy is that?

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.927
And people buy that?
Oh, my God.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.610
The Council
of the city of New York

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.888
is proud to honor
legendary taste maker,

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.402
fashion icon, businesswoman,
interior designer,

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.483
and style maverick
Iris Apfel.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.883
Today, Mrs. Apfel remains
a popular, outspoken,

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.407
ornate muse
for fashion designers

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.130
and artists of all kinds.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.203
Thank you all
for this humbling honor.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.443
It's really remarkable
that I've been able to live

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.847
and practice
my assorted madness

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.163
in this most
multileveled city in the world,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.368
and I thank you,
and I thank all the residents

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.081
who have supported me
and made me what I am today,

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.884
a geriatric starlet.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.124
I like yourjacket.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.931
Groovy.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.811
I would be happy
to give you this one.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.486
Oh, fantastic.
Voilé.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.450
You'll be a Western...
a Western dude.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.364
A Western dude, yeah.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.330
- Voilé.
- Rhys, the dude.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.448
Look at these.
I love these.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.126
I think they're...

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.650
This has
a double-face cashmere,

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.771
and it actually comes apart
so you can wear...

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.926
this by itself.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.764
Like a stripper.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.961
Is that supposed
to keep me warm?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.009
I don't know.
It's Irish wool.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.841
Let's see.
How much does it cost?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.365
No price.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.727
Well, if you're interested,
tell me.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.689
I'll see if I can help you
with a deal.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.411
He was the original RCA Victor.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.846
He loves jewelry,
and I couldn't get

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.651
anything to fit him,
he has such a fat neck.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.202
And I told him
if he went on a diet...

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.010
See, they used to fight
forjewelry.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.685
They bit his ears.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.209
Finally, I was in a hat shop,
and these are hat bands.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.125
So I said, "Gee,
that'll fit that fatso."

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.649
I bought that one
because she looked

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.646
just like a client I had,
that kind of a face.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.250
He's a cute little guy.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.646
- Carl!
- What?

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.690
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Do I want a cup of tea?

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.446
- Oh, that would be nice.
- You do?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.171
Lemon tea, lots of lemon.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.445
- Albert?
- Yeah.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.250
Would you like
a cup of something?

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.323
She's making me some tea.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.403
Good.
ls that okay?

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.925
Yeah.
