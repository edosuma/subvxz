03:10.108 --> 03:11.276
Oh.

03:12.193 --> 03:16.447
Yeah. Josh, Max, up we go. We overslept.
Come on, come on.

03:16.531 --> 03:18.908
- Let's go. We're in a rush. Quick.
- Come on, soldiers.

03:18.992 --> 03:22.495

I can drop you off.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.670

Your nightmare.

03:38.845 --> 03:40.555
Oh, it was stupid.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.849
Nothing, really.

03:44.601 --> 03:45.768
You said "rape."

03:47.520 --> 03:49.230

Yep.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.829
First day of school!

04:47.956 --> 04:51.084
- Stop. Hey, Max, you idiot!
- Hey, hey, boys come on.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.419
Keep it down, would you?
I can't hear myself think.

04:53.503 --> 04:54.879
Then just don't think, Mom.

04:54.963 --> 04:56.339
- Give it back, you idiot!
- Hey.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.674
- Stop.
- Give it back.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.133
Hey. Quiet!

05:03.054 --> 05:04.597
Fine young men

05:04.681 --> 05:07.392
don't suddenly become fine young men
all of a sudden

05:07.475 --> 05:08.893
in a whoosh, you know.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.438
It starts with being fine young boys.

05:12.522 --> 05:17.777
And part of being a fine young boy
is listening and respecting your mother.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.821
She works so hard for you.

05:19.904 --> 05:22.198
That's why the sun shines on her so.

05:24.242 --> 05:25.910
Thank you, Mary Louise.

05:31.124 --> 05:33.710
I have two showings,
I have Abigail's college advisor,

05:33.793 --> 05:35.294
not to mention all this scrutiny.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.213
- It's just gonna be a day.
- What scrutiny?

05:37.296 --> 05:40.800
Ed, this is the first day of school.
We have to earn our good mom badges

05:40.883 --> 05:43.636
all over again.
"Has she gotten fatter over the summer?"

05:43.720 --> 05:46.431
"Does she look older?"
These questions get asked, Ed,

05:46.514 --> 05:48.725
and we all get judged all over again.

05:48.808 --> 05:51.227
It's a double standard.
If a dad shows up, they're like:

05:51.310 --> 05:53.479
"Wow, there's a dad here. He's involved."

05:53.563 --> 05:56.441
But with the moms, ugh.
It just makes me wanna blow.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.524
Boom!

05:57.567 --> 06:00.570
Oh, my God, Chloe. Goddamn it.

06:00.653 --> 06:04.657
Just right there. I need to get right there.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Warren.

07:43.047 --> 07:45.466
Really pushing the school spirit
this year, aren't you?

07:45.550 --> 07:47.426
Well, it's my otter blood, Madeline.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.012
- Hi, Madeline Martha Mackenzie.
- Lisa Coolidge.

07:50.096 --> 07:52.306
Anyway, it was a beautiful service, Warren.

07:52.390 --> 07:55.560
Well, thank you, Madeline,
I like to think of it more as an assembly.

07:55.643 --> 08:00.064
A service is for when someone dies,
you know, like a school fundraiser.

08:00.148 --> 08:02.358
You're not seriously gonna go there,
are you?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.152
My hope is you don't go there.

08:04.235 --> 08:09.115
Now, let's remember a lot of last year's
mishigas were lovingly stirred up by you.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.867
Anybody want a red velvet?

08:10.950 --> 08:13.077
- Melissa.
- Cupcake?

08:13.161 --> 08:15.746
- I'll take one for each thigh.
- Absolutely.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.332
I don't even like to chew.
I just shove them down.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.085
Maybe you can give one to Warren
so he can shove it too.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.420
Ah.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.338
And we're off.

08:24.422 --> 08:27.383
- It's a classy crop of moms, these ones.
- Bonnie.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.342
Those gluten-free?

08:28.426 --> 08:29.760
Tahoe was good?

08:29.844 --> 08:32.679
Uh, yeah, it was good.
Nathan caught a lot of fish.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.842
- Wow.
- And I hear you're selling houses like crazy.

08:34.890 --> 08:35.765
That's very cool.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.352
Oh, my gosh, in Monterey,
it is like printing money.

08:38.436 --> 08:39.937
I should've done this years ago.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.065
- I'm gonna go find Skye.
- Okay.

08:45.151 --> 08:47.737
Okay. Are you two fighting?

08:47.820 --> 08:50.865
No. Actually, I almost wish we were.
No, she's...

08:51.908 --> 08:54.577
She's been acting like that
for a while now.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.703
Acting like what?

08:56.746 --> 08:59.248
Shut down. Like, withdrawn.

08:59.332 --> 09:01.500
Oh, you mean you're not having sex.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.920
Don't forget
Abigail has her college counselor meeting

09:04.003 --> 09:05.588
- at 2 p.m.
- Yeah, I got your e-mails.

09:05.671 --> 09:06.881
Six of them this morning.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.217
- It's good. Thank you.
- This is her future, Nathan.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.135
Nice to be back.

09:11.219 --> 09:15.181
I'm told that my daughter, Amabella,
is gonna be in your class. So exciting.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.724
Yes, very nice to meet you.

09:16.807 --> 09:22.396
Um, she has an IQ of 152. Genius level,
right? That's a very high number.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.483
Life's about give and take.
I expect you to take care of my daughter.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.692
Pay special attention.

09:26.776 --> 09:28.027
And, again, welcome.

09:29.487 --> 09:31.530
Um, oh, oh, oh.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.951
And my Amabella was bullied last year.

09:35.034 --> 09:38.120
I mean, in, like, biting and choking.

09:38.204 --> 09:41.707
So we're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen again.

09:41.791 --> 09:44.001
Oh.

09:44.961 --> 09:46.254
Sorry.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.588
Sorry.

09:47.672 --> 09:49.840
Here's my problem
with the whole meditation thing.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.718
Like you shut out the world,
but you also shut out your friends,

09:52.802 --> 09:53.802
which is a bit weird.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.681
And also, does she look funny?
Something's not right.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.724
- You're talking about Bonnie?
- Mm-hm.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.688
Like, she's off.
But she was off before she went to Tahoe.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.149
Unplugged is one thing,
but unhinged is a total other thing.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.026
Hey! Asshole! Hey!

10:09.110 --> 10:11.404
- Oh, hon.
- Why are you cutting me off?

10:11.487 --> 10:14.573
- Honey. The horn. The horn.
- Dick! I just think we... Oh, yeah, sorry.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.951
- Once I lean in, you know how I am.
- Indeed.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.912
And I think we need to talk to her
and see where her head is at.

10:19.996 --> 10:21.747
- Do you?
- Do you wanna get a coffee?

10:22.790 --> 10:26.877
By the way, did you see Renata
getting up that new teacher's ass?

10:26.961 --> 10:29.255
I thought she was gonna have to pull out
her snorkel.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.299
Easy.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

10:31.382 --> 10:32.675
Can you get me an Americano?

10:32.758 --> 10:33.801
Will do.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.137
- Hey, Bruna.
- Hey, Madeline.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.014
Do you sell weed?
Smells like weed over here.

10:38.097 --> 10:40.308
- Keep the change.
- Thank you so much.

10:40.391 --> 10:43.477
Can I get an Americano
and a bran muffin?

10:43.561 --> 10:45.855
- ...that's a thing?
- Mary Louise?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.983
- Hi. I'm Madeline.
- Hi.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.611
- Madeline. So nice to see you again.
- Yes. I'm Celeste's friend. Yes.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.656
- How have you been?
- Good, good. The kids are good.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.658
- How are you?
- I can't complain.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.161
Actually, I can.

11:03.456 --> 11:04.665
My son is dead.

11:07.752 --> 11:10.588
But Celeste tells me
that you continue to be so helpful

11:10.671 --> 11:12.381
with her and the boys and...

11:12.465 --> 11:14.592
She should just get
a proper housekeeper.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.011
- You're very short.
- Excuse me?

11:17.094 --> 11:19.680
- I don't mean it in a negative way.
- Oh.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.891
Maybe I do.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.687
I find little people to be untrustworthy.

11:27.897 --> 11:30.441
My apologies.
It's just that I'm...

11:32.068 --> 11:34.737
I pride myself on being
a very good judge of character,

11:34.820 --> 11:38.240
but you have always presented
such a difficult read.

11:38.324 --> 11:43.329
You know, you seem like a nice person.
Loving.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.582
But, also, you strike me as a "wanter."

11:46.665 --> 11:49.001
- A wanter?
- Mm.

11:49.085 --> 11:52.088
You know, there are people in life

11:52.171 --> 11:54.757
who content themselves
with what they have,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.134
and then there are others who just...

11:58.177 --> 11:59.553
Just want.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.348
I'm not a wanter.

12:02.431 --> 12:06.685
Oh, you don't have to take it personally.
Anyway, I'm a wanter myself.

12:07.728 --> 12:11.065
You know what I want?
I want Perry back.

12:11.148 --> 12:16.070
I wanna know what happened that night.
And I'm very tempted to ask you,

12:16.153 --> 12:20.366
but I doubt I would get the, uh, truth,
would I?

12:23.077 --> 12:25.162
Your son lost his balance and he fell.

12:25.246 --> 12:28.332
Yes, that seems to be the company line.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.626
Depending on whose company you keep.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.420
Mary Louise.

12:32.503 --> 12:35.714
Madeline and I were just... talking.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.593
What the hell was that?
That was a very strong position.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.221
And I didn't like it.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.639
Welcome to my life.

12:50.396 --> 12:51.814
Sorry.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.816
Whoa.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.569
- Hi.
- Tori.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.071
Sorry, I didn't recognize you at first.

12:59.155 --> 13:01.782
Yeah. I, uh, had my breasts done.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.744
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's fabulous.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.955
I always felt a little self-conscious,
you know.

13:10.124 --> 13:11.000
About your breasts?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.793
- My nose.
- Ah.

13:12.877 --> 13:15.713
Now nobody notices it so much.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.758
Everybody notices these, though.
And that pisses Joseph off.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.511
So, uh...

13:22.595 --> 13:24.555
Well, I'll see you around.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.017
Hmm.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.856
How long does she plan to stay?

13:33.939 --> 13:37.151
Well, she comes and goes.
It's a short hop from San Francisco.

13:38.277 --> 13:42.114
She's been a really big help.

13:42.198 --> 13:43.073
Mm-hm.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.534
I mean, I'd be lost without her.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.287
So, what brings you?

13:48.370 --> 13:49.663
It's been a while.

13:56.086 --> 14:00.090
I've had some nightmares
starting up of late that, um...

14:01.342 --> 14:04.094
I mean, may be triggered
by the beginning of the school year.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.598
I think I still associate
that place with...

14:07.681 --> 14:08.807
How could you not?

14:14.063 --> 14:16.524
Last night was...

14:16.607 --> 14:18.400
It was a beauty.

14:21.862 --> 14:27.117
Perry and I
were in the in-vitro facility, and...

14:29.036 --> 14:32.206
it was all so sweet, and...

14:32.289 --> 14:34.208
And suddenly, I...

14:35.751 --> 14:39.213
I turned into a monster.

14:39.296 --> 14:42.800
I was strangling him.
I was lifting him up, and I...

14:42.883 --> 14:43.883
I...

14:45.970 --> 14:49.306
It was beyond disturbing, and I...

14:52.476 --> 14:53.852
A little exhilarating.

14:54.687 --> 14:55.729
Hmm.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.317
Is that...?
Do you see yourself as a monster?

15:02.611 --> 15:04.363
I guess I still feel...

15:07.491 --> 15:08.867
responsible.

15:08.951 --> 15:09.951
For?

15:12.371 --> 15:13.539
For the accident.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.584
I mean, if I'd left him when I should have.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.669
We should never have been together
that night,

15:18.752 --> 15:20.546
and he might still be alive.

15:20.629 --> 15:25.175
That I chose that night, of all nights,
to leave him and to tell him and...

15:29.179 --> 15:32.349
Even in death, his message lives on.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.977
- What message?
- That you're to blame.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.354
That you're always to blame.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.443
You're not.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.118
Are you getting out?

15:51.201 --> 15:55.164
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.791
That part of me is still dead, I suppose.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.252
First things first,
get the boys' lives back on track.

16:00.336 --> 16:01.420
That's the priority.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.547
Seeing their mom happy
could help there.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.799
So you're saying
for my life to go on successfully,

16:05.883 --> 16:07.843
- I need to be with a man?
- No.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.262
But the freedom to be with one, maybe.

16:11.889 --> 16:15.851
You're still married, Celeste,
and the husband is dead.

16:40.751 --> 16:41.751
Where have you been?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.254
I told you I was running.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.965
That was like two hours ago,
I've been calling you.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.049
Sorry.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.183
Bonnie. I just thought it might be
that you hated Tahoe,

16:56.266 --> 16:58.018
but since we've been back...

17:00.020 --> 17:01.355
Come on.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.441
I need some space, Nathan. I told you.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.234
Just let it be.

17:06.318 --> 17:10.571
He's my favorite in the whole aquarium.
It's a red octopus, and watch.

17:10.656 --> 17:13.325
The closer he gets to the kelp,
he'll change his color

17:13.409 --> 17:15.493
so that he camouflages
with his environment.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.746
- Cool.
- Look. You see him right now?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.873
- Yeah.
- He's changing color.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.916
You guys wanna know a fun fact
about octopus?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.627
- Yeah!
- It's kind of weird.

17:23.711 --> 17:25.838
- You can handle it?
- Yeah.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.757
Okay. Females contain deadly venom.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.385
And sometimes they'll kill
and they'll eat the males

17:31.468 --> 17:33.262
after they mate with them.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.555
Ew!

17:35.389 --> 17:36.389
- I know.
- Interesting.

17:36.432 --> 17:40.102
Why is it the prettier something is,
the more dangerous?

17:40.185 --> 17:42.020
Like with snakes and spiders.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.690
That's a great question.
I wish I knew the answer to that.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.483
- One second.
- You're so observant.

17:46.567 --> 17:49.319
Sometimes, pretty colors
are to give a fair warning

17:49.403 --> 17:52.656
so other animals know
they need to keep a safe distance.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.116
Oh...

18:00.164 --> 18:01.164
There you go.

18:06.879 --> 18:07.879
How you doing?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.549
Good. You?

18:12.384 --> 18:14.720
Not really, no. Bonnie.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.473
I mean, she's gone missing
in mental action.

18:17.556 --> 18:20.058
The whole summer, truth be told.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.435
Hey, man, could I...?

18:22.895 --> 18:26.690
Could I ask you a big favor?
Could you maybe take her out to lunch?

18:28.150 --> 18:30.652
You've always been better
at talking to women than I have,

18:30.736 --> 18:33.322
and you certainly got Madeline
in a way that I never could.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.824
I mean, I think you might be able
to get her to open up.

18:35.908 --> 18:39.536
You know, you have your little way.
All I'm getting is pushback at every turn.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.207
I swear to God, if I signed up for this
bullshit, I'd still be with Maddie.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.833
I mean... I don't mean...

18:44.917 --> 18:47.085
Oh, no, no. Um...

18:47.169 --> 18:51.089
Look, Nathan,
I'm no expert on marriage or anything.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.466
I mean, something tells me

18:52.549 --> 18:55.511
if you're seeking out the husband
of your ex-wife

18:55.594 --> 18:59.306
to, like, lead the communication charge
with your new one...

19:02.643 --> 19:05.312
- Why do you always have to be so snide?
- I don't mean to be.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.440
You don't mean to be, it just comes natural.
Like you're a snide fuck.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.317
That's what you are. A snide fuck.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.904
You know, Nathan,
maybe instead of just talking to Bonnie,

19:13.987 --> 19:16.573
you should embrace
some of her interests.

19:16.657 --> 19:17.657
- Her interests?
- Yeah.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.785
She won't even let me embrace her.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.245
- Okay.
- Yeah, you're snide.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.538
- You're a snide fuck.
- What?

19:23.664 --> 19:24.873
- Whatever.
- Come on.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.208
Snide fuck.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.423

19:39.263 --> 19:42.057
Hey, honey. I'm pulling in.
Can you...? Can...?

19:42.140 --> 19:44.434
Wait. Hold on one second. Hold on...

19:44.518 --> 19:46.603
- Hello?
<i>- This is my talk about being nice.</i>

19:46.687 --> 19:49.606

<i>- People don't take my word...</i>

19:49.690 --> 19:51.358
But what do you think?

19:51.441 --> 19:52.943
I love the view.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.903
Oh, sorry, I'm on the phone.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.823
Yeah, I thought Tahoe was supposed
to be about decompression too,

19:57.906 --> 19:59.491
but she seems like she's on Mars.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.576
Maybe she's using.

20:00.659 --> 20:03.370
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, just a second.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.164
And I am beating myself up
that I told Jane I liked her bangs.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.251
- Can you get off the phone, please?
- Hmm?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.712
Oh, let me call you back.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.215
Yeah, what can I do for you?

20:15.299 --> 20:17.134
I can't deny it.

20:17.217 --> 20:21.054
<i>- ♪ It's my house and I live here ♪</i>
- Good, right there.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.267
<i>♪ It's my house and I live here ♪</i>

20:25.350 --> 20:27.436
Beautiful. Come on down. Good.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.856
- Eyes up this way. Gorgeous.
- I'm so tired of those shots of women.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.357
I mean, they're in power, right?

20:32.441 --> 20:35.360
They own banks,
and they're all, like, demure. Bullshit.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.488
Back to the ocean.

20:38.572 --> 20:39.948
What's all this?

20:40.032 --> 20:42.910
Hey. The photo shoot. Women in power.

20:42.993 --> 20:49.666
- I thought they wanted just, uh, office shots.
- No, they're doing house and office.

20:49.750 --> 20:50.750
You look nice.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.671
<i>- ♪ It's my house and I live here ♪</i>
- Here we go. Look at me.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.606
So she has a 3.8 GPA,

21:12.689 --> 21:16.109
and she has done charity work
with human trafficking.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.195
- She also has an internship coming up...
- Okay.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.988
Stanford has an admit rate of under 10.

21:20.072 --> 21:23.450
Princeton and Williams the same. Since
she doesn't have legacy going for her...

21:23.533 --> 21:25.994
Any of these schools would be lucky
to have her.

21:26.078 --> 21:28.330
She's an excellent candidate...

21:28.413 --> 21:30.624
- Candidate is, I think, the wrong...
- Honey.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.377
What? Don't "honey" me.
She has a 3.8 GPA.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.797
She has a 1350 on her SATs,
but we're gonna get that number up

21:36.880 --> 21:39.549
because she has private tutoring
coming up, so I feel...

21:39.633 --> 21:41.677
I don't even wanna go to college.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.807
Okay. She's just... She's just nervous.
She doesn't mean that.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.060
I do mean it. I don't wanna go to college.

21:51.269 --> 21:53.897
It feels so good to say that out loud.

21:53.981 --> 21:56.775
Okay, Abigail, honey.
You're going to college.

21:56.858 --> 22:01.655
The planet is dying, Mom,
but God forbid I don't study <i>Lysistrata?</i>

22:01.738 --> 22:03.991
It's bullshit.
Do you know what kids do at college?

22:04.074 --> 22:07.411
They drink, they fuck.
They mull over a sex change.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.456
- I'm not going. I'm not going to college.
- You're going to college.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.709
If you wanna go, you go.
You should go to college.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.128
Hey, no,
I know how to make any situation about me.

22:16.211 --> 22:18.964
This is not that.
This is about you and your future, Abigail.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.047
Abby.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.594
- I'm not going.
- I'm so sorry.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.016
- Where did she go?
- I...

22:31.143 --> 22:33.520
- Did you know about this?
- No, I swear.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.314
You were with her all summer,
and you knew nothing about this?

22:36.398 --> 22:37.899
- I didn't know.
- What about Bonnie?

22:37.983 --> 22:39.901
Did she know
about this "fuck college" plan?

22:39.985 --> 22:41.528
Bonnie's left the building.

22:43.697 --> 22:47.701
Unbelievable. You know if she doesn't
go to college, she won't have a life.

22:47.784 --> 22:51.288
She'll just be serving Big Macs
and French fries, and that'll be her life.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.249
- Is that what you want for her, Nathan?
- Stop. Stop yelling at me.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.334
- You know you bear some responsibility.
- I do?

22:56.418 --> 22:58.795
- You're her father. This is her senior year,
- Oh, okay.

22:58.879 --> 23:02.257
she's on the cusp of her life,
and you let it go all to shit in Tahoe!

23:02.340 --> 23:05.177
- You just hit me. You just hit me.
- Because you deserve it.

23:22.736 --> 23:25.363
But honestly, Ed,
if she doesn't go to college,

23:25.447 --> 23:26.907
what's she gonna do?

23:26.990 --> 23:28.283
Go into retail?

23:30.410 --> 23:31.620
Let me call you right back.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.998
- Mary Louise?
- Hey, Maddie.

23:35.082 --> 23:36.166
Madeline. Hello.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.667
What's going on?

23:37.751 --> 23:41.463
Well, I thought I might look
for a small flat here in town,

23:41.546 --> 23:45.675
so that I can help out with the boys
but not quite be so underfoot.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.637
- Oh, I see.
- Do you work here?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.472
- Yes.
- Do you handle rentals?

23:50.555 --> 23:53.308
- I do, actually. Oren and I both do, yes.
- Oh.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.102
I see you're wearing heels.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.146
Yes.

23:59.064 --> 24:02.150
Um, Oren, do you mind if I just
have a minute with Mrs. Wright?

24:02.234 --> 24:05.028
Of course not.
You're in wonderful hands.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.112
Thank you.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.200
Mary Louise,
I realize that you're still grieving,

24:10.283 --> 24:13.328
and that you've been through
a tremendous amount of heartbreak,

24:13.411 --> 24:15.664
but I don't care
for the way you spoke to me before.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.707
It was rude, and I didn't deserve it.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.709
No, you didn't.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.753
Um, I apologize.

24:22.879 --> 24:23.880
Well, thank you.

24:23.964 --> 24:26.007
The truth is it had nothing to do
with you.

24:26.091 --> 24:29.177
When I was in boarding school,
I had a best friend,

24:29.261 --> 24:31.012
or so I thought,

24:31.096 --> 24:33.765
who, uh, revealed herself
to be quite treacherous

24:33.849 --> 24:36.726
and, uh, caused me a lot of pain.

24:37.936 --> 24:38.937
So...

24:39.020 --> 24:43.358
She was just an itty-bitty little thing
with a big, bubbly personality

24:43.441 --> 24:48.738
that, um, was designed to hide
that she was utterly vapid inside.

24:48.822 --> 24:52.826
You remind me so much of her
that I suppose I punish you for that.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.120
That's wrong of me, and I apologize.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.292
- Oren.
- Yes. Sorry.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.254
I'm sure Oren will address
all of your concerns.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.922
Okay.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.216

26:23.500 --> 26:25.835
You probably don't wanna
act weird and shit in public.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.837
We do a lot of kids' events
at the aquarium.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.632
Parents have a thing
about entrusting their kids to psychos.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.552
Noted. Got it. Thank you.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.180
The way people talk in this town,
I don't need to tell you.

26:38.265 --> 26:41.101
You don't need to tell me?
What does that mean?

26:42.352 --> 26:44.437
You're one of the Monterey Five, right?

26:45.647 --> 26:46.856
Monterey Five?

26:46.940 --> 26:48.733
You were there the night the guy fell.

26:48.817 --> 26:52.112
- Where did you hear that?
- Someone at work.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.406
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

26:56.616 --> 27:00.287
- It was just the way he said it.
- How exactly was that?

27:00.370 --> 27:02.831
Like we all have scarlet letters
on our backs.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.624
- Oh, please.
- We're kidding ourselves

27:04.708 --> 27:07.877
- if we think people have stopped talking.
- Yeah, but people talk. It's...

27:07.961 --> 27:10.380
I think we're all being a
little bit paranoid, you guys.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.133
I think people have moved on.
The police definitely moved on.

27:13.216 --> 27:16.052
- We don't know for sure.
- Yeah... No, I talked to Susie Burke.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.721
- Do you know Susie from IBM?
- Yeah.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.432
She's a good friend of Detective Quinlan.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.515
- Oh.
- Mm.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.643
I mean, like, really good friend.

27:23.727 --> 27:28.106
Gossip for another day, but she told me
that she heard Quinlan say,

27:28.189 --> 27:32.861
like, the case isn't "closed" closed,
but they've got nothing.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.654
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

27:36.239 --> 27:37.239
Good.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.784
- We're good.
- Okay.

27:39.868 --> 27:40.868
Yeah.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.468
Where were you?
We were waiting for you at the beach.

27:56.551 --> 27:58.928
Oh, yeah. Um, something came up.

27:59.971 --> 28:00.971
Yeah?

28:04.059 --> 28:05.059
What?

28:06.603 --> 28:07.937
Are you all right?

28:09.481 --> 28:10.982
Do you care?

28:11.066 --> 28:12.817
Do I care?

28:12.901 --> 28:13.902
What's going on?

28:18.615 --> 28:20.575
I killed someone.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.285
- Remember?
- Yes.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.870
- I...
- It's heavy.

28:23.953 --> 28:27.290
Are you...? I mean, are you angry at me
for some reason?

28:31.628 --> 28:33.046
I'm angry with myself.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.050
If I had just told the truth,
I would have gotten off,

28:37.133 --> 28:38.218
but you said he slipped,

28:38.301 --> 28:40.345
and everyone else joined
in the fucking chorus.

28:40.428 --> 28:43.223
- That was to protect you.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.061
You know, I can't talk to my husband.

28:49.687 --> 28:50.688
Or my kid.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.943
I have to just swallow it all.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.029
You can talk to us.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.490
We're here for you. All of us.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.869
Well, it hasn't really felt like that.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.997
Well, I'm sorry, but you've been in Tahoe.

29:08.081 --> 29:11.709
It's not like you can put that shit on Gmail.
Like, what am I supposed to...?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.211
Hey.

29:13.837 --> 29:14.712
Hey.

29:14.796 --> 29:15.796
Bye, Maddie.

29:22.178 --> 29:25.140
- Little Miss Sunshine, right?
- Listen, I'm sorry I pushed you.

29:25.223 --> 29:26.349
There you go, I said it.

29:26.891 --> 29:30.270
Okay, um, I need to talk to Abby.
Is she here?

29:31.396 --> 29:32.439
Abby!

29:36.693 --> 29:39.571
<i>♪ Scented and tall ♪</i>

29:39.654 --> 29:45.118
<i>♪ Hesitating once more ♪</i>

29:45.201 --> 29:46.911
<i>♪ And as I take... ♪</i>

29:49.247 --> 29:50.498
So...

29:51.749 --> 29:53.251
what was that all about?

29:53.334 --> 29:57.589
I just don't think college is for everyone,
that's all.

29:57.672 --> 29:58.798
Okay.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.302
So why is it not for you?

30:02.385 --> 30:05.763
Well, starting with the cost.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.849
It's really expensive.

30:07.932 --> 30:11.144
So I'm assuming that if you're gonna
abandon that plan to go to college,

30:11.227 --> 30:12.562
- you have another plan...
- I do.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.274
What is it?

30:17.442 --> 30:20.278
- It's to work for a startup.
- Oh, my God.

30:20.361 --> 30:24.532
Specifically, one that builds
for-profit housing for the homeless.

30:24.616 --> 30:25.658
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

30:25.742 --> 30:31.623
And unlike, you know, the privatized shams
like banks and credit card companies,

30:31.706 --> 30:34.792
ours will make money
while actually helping people.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.294
This is something real?

30:36.377 --> 30:39.339
I've been offered a position
to start in June.

30:39.422 --> 30:41.508
- You cannot be serious.
- I'm gonna take it.

30:41.591 --> 30:45.345
You cannot mortgage your future
over some sort of short-term plan.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.640
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, then, what are you doing?

30:48.723 --> 30:51.601
There are four million homeless people
in America,

30:51.684 --> 30:53.770
the average age being 9 years old.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.396
- And I...
- I don't give a fuck!

30:55.480 --> 30:58.399
I don't care
about fucking homeless people.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.736
- What?
- That is not what I meant.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.530
I do care about homeless people.

31:03.613 --> 31:06.491
I just think you can give money
to some charity

31:06.574 --> 31:08.660
while you actually attend college.

31:08.743 --> 31:11.204
- I'm not going to college.
- Yes, you are.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.999
- Give me one good reason why I should.
- It's non-negotiable. You're going to college

31:15.083 --> 31:17.752
because I said so,
and because you're not thinking straight...

31:17.835 --> 31:19.837
- Because you said so?
- Yes, because I said so.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.923
What do you know?
You didn't go to college.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.842
That's exactly why you're going.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.469
Exactly.

31:26.553 --> 31:28.555
Because you will have no life!

31:43.736 --> 31:45.530
Can't you just tell her it's time to go?

31:45.613 --> 31:48.908
The boys love her. I mean, they love her.

31:48.992 --> 31:50.827
And she's...

31:50.910 --> 31:53.079
She's a big help. She really is.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.583
So, what's up?

31:56.666 --> 31:59.877
I'm guessing you don't need my help
on how to handle a mother-in-law.

32:01.379 --> 32:03.923
Why are you not cashing the checks?

32:04.757 --> 32:07.510
- I don't know.
- Come on, Jane. Why?

32:07.594 --> 32:10.888
It's rape money. You know I can't do that.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.727
Ziggy's entitled to it.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.729
He's part of Perry's estate.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.649
Do you ever hate me? Just a little bit?

32:24.861 --> 32:26.279
How could I hate you?

32:26.362 --> 32:28.573
Because I slept with your husband.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.200
I mean, I didn't...

32:31.284 --> 32:32.744
You know what I mean.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.412
He raped you.

32:34.495 --> 32:35.663
But I knew he was married.

32:35.747 --> 32:39.459
I mean, I didn't know he was married to you,
but somebody.

32:39.542 --> 32:40.418
No.

32:40.501 --> 32:42.629
I don't blame you for anything.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.883
I think I would if I were in your shoes.

32:48.092 --> 32:51.638
Celeste, for a man to commit adultery, he...
There has to be another woman,

32:51.721 --> 32:55.141
and, you know what, more times than not,
she's complicit. I was complicit.

32:55.224 --> 32:59.520
Not in the end,
but definitely in the beginning.

33:08.237 --> 33:09.989
Are you glad that he's dead?

33:13.409 --> 33:14.911
It's complicated.

Come.

34:51.591 --> 34:55.344
This looks so delicious.
Thank you, Mary Louise.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.972
I thought we were having KFC.

34:58.055 --> 35:01.642
Well, one cannot survive
on fast food every night.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.644
We don't have it every night.

35:03.728 --> 35:08.149
You know that they ban
these insidious fast food institutions

35:08.232 --> 35:10.568
from some parts of San Francisco.

35:10.651 --> 35:14.489
Do you remember when we walked
across the Golden Gate Bridge?

35:14.572 --> 35:15.698
It's red.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.700
Yeah, you're right, it is red.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.912
Oh, and Dad said
he was gonna swim to Alcatraz.

35:20.995 --> 35:22.705
Oh, yeah.

35:22.789 --> 35:25.166
Sharks would have eaten him, stupid.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.918
No, they wouldn't, idiot.

35:28.419 --> 35:30.546
Hey! Hey! You could hurt him.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.007
What's wrong with you?

35:33.090 --> 35:36.844
- I barely touched him.
- You stuck him with a fork, Josh.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.471
That is unacceptable.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.640
For God's sake.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.187
I miss Dad.

35:48.439 --> 35:50.316
I know, baby.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.526
I know you do.

35:53.820 --> 35:54.820
We all do.

35:55.947 --> 36:00.785
- We still have some recovery ahead of us.
- Well, they're grieving, Celeste.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.539
Their father's death is not...

36:05.581 --> 36:08.668
something to be recovered from,
like a cold.

36:08.751 --> 36:12.046
You know,
your daddy was the most amazing man,

36:12.129 --> 36:14.048
and you were so lucky to have him.

36:15.091 --> 36:19.679
And it's very unfair
and wrong that he died.

36:19.762 --> 36:23.140
And you still feel angry about it,
don't you?

36:23.224 --> 36:27.562
I mean, you feel angry that the other kids
have their dads. You don't.

36:28.604 --> 36:31.566
You know, the other day,
I was with some friends,

36:31.649 --> 36:36.153
and, um, their sons were not a patch
on your dad.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.780
Not a patch.

36:39.115 --> 36:41.284
Just... I felt so angry.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.493
Angry!

36:42.577 --> 36:48.499
You know, that their mediocre,
spindly, pudgy, balding,

36:48.583 --> 36:51.586
middle-management sons, still alive.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.629
And my Perry...

36:53.713 --> 36:55.715
My Perry...

36:55.798 --> 36:58.259
I just felt just... I wanted to scream.

37:00.177 --> 37:01.262
So you know what I did?

37:01.345 --> 37:03.014
- What?
- I did scream.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.559
You wanna hear?

37:06.642 --> 37:07.643
Okay.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.031
Mary Louise! Mary Louise!
Mary Louise, please.

37:20.114 --> 37:22.575
What, my grief is too loud for you?

37:22.658 --> 37:24.327
- Oh, Celeste.
- No, just... Just...

37:24.410 --> 37:26.329
- I should be more discreet.
- The boys.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.332
We should scream. We should scream

37:29.415 --> 37:32.460
and beat our breasts and tear our hair.

37:32.543 --> 37:33.920
Don't you feel angry?

37:37.048 --> 37:38.466
You don't?

37:46.098 --> 37:47.183
I'm sorry.

37:51.187 --> 37:53.773
I feel so, so alone, you know.
