11:55.014 --> 11:57.676
And you... you go
into attack mode way too easily,

that empathy thing just for you.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.859
I just, I swear,

13:15.895 --> 13:17.727
it's like her claim
to fame... use this.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.528
It's like her claim to fame
that they were together;

13:20.566 --> 13:22.557
we all know that, she doesn't
have to bring it up every time.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.160
Do you know they
weren't even together that long?

13:24.203 --> 13:26.638
Does Trish have to bring this up
at every gathering?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.140
Okay, she dated you senior year,

13:28.174 --> 13:30.233
so what?

13:30.276 --> 13:32.768
You know she can't get
over all this dog,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.644
you know she can't.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.841
Come on man who you fooling?

13:35.881 --> 13:37.542
This is me you talking to.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.711
You sniffing around that girl
dorm room for six months

13:39.752 --> 13:41.117
after she broke up with you.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.850
Man, whatever dog,
you bringing up old stuff.

13:43.889 --> 13:48.019
Well, he also said she's boring
as hell in bed, so...

13:48.060 --> 13:50.028
Who's better in bed,
Trish or Brianna?

13:50.062 --> 13:53.521
Look you know I
don't talk like that.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.591
Come on, man,
it's just me and you.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.068
Come on, bro.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.537
All right look, I love...

13:59.572 --> 14:02.234
I love Bri with all my heart
you know what I'm saying?

14:02.274 --> 14:07.144
But Trish, oh,
Trish is just so gifted.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.612
She's got this...

14:10.649 --> 14:12.310
she got these hands okay?

14:12.351 --> 14:15.616
And I'm just like laying there
sucking my thumb,

14:15.654 --> 14:17.884
calling my mom, oh please,

14:17.923 --> 14:18.890
I don't wanna leave.

14:20.192 --> 14:30.159
<i>L“</i>

14:57.863 --> 15:00.298
Just the way you like it.

15:00.332 --> 15:03.996
Yes, two sugars and skim milk.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.526
Go ahead, mama.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.304
Miss Jackson.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.707
You haven't married
my daughter yet.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.142
Right, right.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.838
Mrs. J.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.645
Mrs. Jackson.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.880
Mrs. Jackson.
There you go.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.887
Bottoms up.

15:24.123 --> 15:27.058
Baby, when did you get here?

15:33.065 --> 15:34.294
Did you really think
I'd be late?

15:34.333 --> 15:40.670
Um, yes, you're always late; you
may be late to your own funeral.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.231
Nice seeing you too.
Oh, what the hell?

15:42.274 --> 15:43.708
Come here give me a hug. Listen,

15:43.742 --> 15:47.770
I'm sorry you
to marry you know,

15:47.813 --> 15:49.281
'cause she's attracted
to the thug type and all but,

15:49.315 --> 15:51.682
uh, no hard feelings okay?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.412
What's done is done.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.285
Okay, just, uh,
leave it to the wonderful Trisha

15:56.322 --> 15:59.917
to masterfully
create an awkward moment.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.327
Wait, can I ask you
a gentle probing question?

16:03.362 --> 16:06.161
Are you upset with me?
Go. Get out of here.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.132
Love you.
Yeah whatever.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.159
What's wrong
with your shirt baby?

16:11.203 --> 16:13.365
Oh, rushing.
There you go.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.338
Let me tell you about that,

16:14.373 --> 16:16.364
uh, sales conference.
What, what happened?

16:16.408 --> 16:18.877
I could not wait
to get out of there.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.175
You know every day
I was just staring at the clock.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.443
Um, I was doing the same thing.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.974
Um, kindred spirits.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.452
Soul mates.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.251
All right now
don't get too corny on me.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.451
Oh I'm corny,
you're the corny one,

16:32.491 --> 16:34.755
but I think it's cute.

16:34.793 --> 16:35.988
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.120
Well I don't know whether to,

16:37.162 --> 16:38.823
uh, be insulted or be,

16:38.864 --> 16:39.797
uh, turned on.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.130
I don't know, tiger,
you have one more day

16:42.167 --> 16:45.034
until lam Mrs. Darnell Riggins.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.005
Um, I love the sound of that.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.030
I mean it is a little ghetto

16:49.074 --> 16:51.406
but I guess I can learn
to own it.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.774
Ghetto?
Mm-hm.

16:52.811 --> 16:57.908
Baby, I'm from Irvine.

16:57.950 --> 17:02.148
Save it for the honeymoon, guys.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.348
Save it for the honeymoon.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.017
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.287
Don't sorry me;

17:07.326 --> 17:08.760
if this marriage has a chance,

17:08.794 --> 17:10.489
you have to keep
the spark alive.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.997
Mom.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.059
So let's go,
the Reverend has arrived.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.160
Well let's not keep
the Reverend waiting.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.032
To the woman of my dreams.

17:25.077 --> 17:28.103
It's only been two years
but you have rocked my world.

17:28.146 --> 17:33.517
No, her mom's gonna be there.
It's only been two years,

17:33.552 --> 17:37.182
but you have changed my world.

17:43.996 --> 17:49.366
You are my world. Yeah.

17:50.202 --> 17:54.867
Mom, hold on.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.535
Hi, uh, go ahead
and wait in line over there.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.374
The good Reverend's right over
there and he's gonna tell you

17:59.411 --> 18:01.903
where to walk, where to stand,
where not to walk,

18:01.947 --> 18:04.006
and then after that we'll just
have some cocktails okay?

18:05.350 --> 18:10.914
It is a wondrous thing to see
you beautiful young people

18:10.956 --> 18:16.520
here today
in celebration of two people.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.156
Two beautiful young people

18:19.198 --> 18:24.159
who will bejoined
for the rest of their lives.

18:25.604 --> 18:29.165
Could we get a minute
just for a quick break?

18:29.208 --> 18:32.803
Could you bow your heads please?

18:32.845 --> 18:39.308
Father God, we ask
for your blessing in the union

18:39.351 --> 18:45.085
of these two beautiful,
beautiful young people,

18:45.124 --> 18:48.219
who have vowed to spend the rest
of their lives together.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.030
That's marijuana.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.467
I smell it.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.130
Uh, what do you know
about marijuana and how do you

18:59.171 --> 19:00.832
know how it smells?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.170
Just because I'm
in private school doesn't mean

19:02.207 --> 19:04.938
it shields me from the universe.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.502
Two more years
and I may let you hit it.

19:06.545 --> 19:12.882
For real?
No! Seriously?

19:12.918 --> 19:15.888
All right, here we go, and.

19:22.027 --> 19:25.361
Just think, there'll be people
watching you on this side,

19:25.397 --> 19:27.331
and on that side.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.528
Chester!

19:29.568 --> 19:32.094
There'll be people on this side
watching you and that side.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.161
You don't- you don't think
I know what you're looking at?

19:33.205 --> 19:35.071
Turn your head.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.405
You tripping man
this-no we just friends.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.309
There we go.
Yeah, okay.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.344
Here comes the bride.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.318
Come on let's try it again.

19:47.352 --> 19:52.882
And then get comfortable
with it.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.223
You need to be practicing
fixing my dress

19:55.260 --> 19:56.386
before I practice knocking
you out.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.419
Okay I got it, dang.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.988
They said that you
would be intense but not

20:00.032 --> 20:01.227
Mike Tyson from the 80s.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.361
Okay, you weren't dreaming about
this  in the 80s.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.666
Uh, I've been here before,
you don't know me.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.899
Okay, well then
I will knock you back

20:06.939 --> 20:07.906
to where you came from before.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.907
Now get in line.

20:08.941 --> 20:09.965
Uh!

20:17.516 --> 20:18.483
I got it.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.678
Go ahead.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.982
Thank you.
Welcome.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.579
Really? You're such a gentleman.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.057
I -- you upset.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.992
Call it what you want player,
but I honor my wife.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.428
And I advise you to do the same
if you wanna keep her.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.090
Amen, Rock.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.998
Listen I ain't about to do
what you saying.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.695
You saying what?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.500
You- you know what?
You all are sick.

20:39.538 --> 20:44.533
Matter of fact,
I... I'm gonna go

20:44.576 --> 20:45.407
outside and get some air.
That's a great idea.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.275
Yeah that's what I'm gonna do.
Mm-hm.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.369
That's what I'm gonna do-
Yeah, bye.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.040
- Ain't nobody out here affecting
me, I'm out of here.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.210
Hey you ain't shit Rock,
I'm just letting you know that.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.516
I'm so sorry.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.454
It's- it's whatever,
you know what?

20:57.489 --> 20:58.456
I need a drink.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.625
...I'm telling him, I ain't
forgiving him for this shit.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.434
Hey, girl.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.002
What's good?

21:22.047 --> 21:23.014
What you over here doing?

21:23.048 --> 21:25.016
Making a wish?

21:25.050 --> 21:27.382
I wasn't, but now I have one.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.251
What you wishing for,
a million dollars or something?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.349
No, for you to go back inside
and leave me alone.

21:32.391 --> 21:36.658
Oh man, come on man.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.094
I admit it man, you know what,

21:38.130 --> 21:40.030
I wasn't shit
when I was an undergrad.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.191
No you still ain't shit.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.428
Okay, all right, I wasn't shit

21:42.467 --> 21:43.628
and I still ain't shit
that's fine.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.364
But the point is, I was...

21:45.404 --> 21:47.133
I was wild in there,
you know that,

21:47.172 --> 21:48.469
you knew what we was on.

21:48.507 --> 21:49.702
I figured maybe, you know,

21:49.741 --> 21:53.143
since we have such a strong past
and that we love each other

21:53.178 --> 21:56.045
as much as we have,
that this weekend

21:56.081 --> 21:57.640
we can start over and get
a fresh start

21:57.683 --> 21:58.650
for the one yard line.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.277
Truth be told Trish, I mean,

22:00.319 --> 22:02.447
I just really hate that you
couldn't be with the man

22:02.487 --> 22:04.148
I am now.

22:04.189 --> 22:07.648
Yeah 'cause the old you needed
to be hanged in Town Square.

22:07.693 --> 22:11.095
Ooh, the attitude and emotion.

22:11.129 --> 22:13.496
You got some deep-rooted
emotion, there's something deep

22:13.532 --> 22:16.399
down locked in a box
under there that you...

22:16.435 --> 22:18.699
Nah, there's no feelings
left over here for you.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.637
So you can go on inside

22:20.672 --> 22:24.631
to your cutesy, conservative,
uptight little girlfriend.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.770
I moved on a long time ago.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.679
I feel like we could at least
be cordial

22:29.715 --> 22:33.151
at our best friend's wedding,
just for the weekend.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.416
I faked it once,
I don't see why not.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.480
I agree.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.719
It's crazy.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.456
I feel like this should be me,

22:43.495 --> 22:44.519
you know?

22:44.563 --> 22:45.530
Yeah.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.534
Beautiful man,

22:48.567 --> 22:51.798
beautiful wedding.

22:51.837 --> 22:52.804
It's kinda like a dream,

22:52.838 --> 22:54.328
you know?

22:56.708 --> 22:59.575
Trish, I mean,

22:59.611 --> 23:01.705
I- I wasn't the best dude, man,

23:01.747 --> 23:05.479
and- and I definitely may not
have the right or- or privilege

23:05.517 --> 23:07.781
to speak upon this but I feel
like you are just one

23:07.819 --> 23:09.583
of the most beautiful,
incredible creatures

23:09.621 --> 23:10.816
that I've ever laid my eyes on.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.120
Your soul,
your character, your spirit,

23:13.158 --> 23:15.217
who you are and what you are.

23:15.260 --> 23:18.491
And I firmly believe
that one day

23:18.530 --> 23:20.589
you will truly find a man
that make you happy that way.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.195
That's if I can only find a man

23:25.237 --> 23:27.296
who loves me as much
as he loves her.

23:32.477 --> 23:36.436
Well, yeah.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.382
I gotta- man,
I gotta get back inside.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.355
See ya.

23:49.594 --> 23:53.656
<i>L“</i>

23:53.698 --> 23:54.665
Junior!

23:54.699 --> 23:56.360
Oh, shit!

23:57.602 --> 24:00.663
Oh, my sweet angel.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.332
Hey, mom.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.365
Oh, you okay?

24:04.409 --> 24:06.400
Yeah.
You must be nervous.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.174
Let me take a look.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.738
Let me see.
Hey, Pop.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.078
Yeah, how's it going, son?

24:12.217 --> 24:13.378
Let me see, honey.

24:14.719 --> 24:15.777
Maybe that old wretched woman

24:15.821 --> 24:18.381
has some aloe planted
around this house somewhere.

24:18.423 --> 24:22.587
But that might make
too much commonsense, you know,

24:22.627 --> 24:24.288
knowing the history
of her family.

24:24.329 --> 24:26.263
Momma,
you promised not to start.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.164
Now Coral, we had an agreement.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.168
Okay. Okay.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.569
Support. Support.

24:32.604 --> 24:34.902
I'm trying; I just want
what's best for you.

24:34.940 --> 24:35.907
Yeah, I know.

24:35.941 --> 24:38.638
I know, a nice
little Jehovah's Witness, right?

24:38.677 --> 24:40.236
Junior.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.906
We have different beliefs.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.747
Okay, and that can cause
some problems here.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.878
Coral.

24:47.919 --> 24:49.853
Okay, okay.

24:49.888 --> 24:50.980
It's okay, dad.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.888
You know I've been hearing
this for about a year now.

24:52.924 --> 24:55.222
You know, it's just too soon
for all of this.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.695
A mother knows. I know.

24:57.729 --> 25:00.289
Uh, look, Coral, why...

25:00.332 --> 25:03.233
why don't we just step outside
and let Darnell finish

25:03.268 --> 25:04.235
getting dressed for lunch,

25:04.269 --> 25:05.964
okay? Hm?

25:06.004 --> 25:07.199
Okay.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.343
But I'm not saying one word
to that woman out there.

25:14.379 --> 25:15.869
Coral, please!

25:15.914 --> 25:18.440
Mom, I'll be
right out all right?

25:21.887 --> 25:28.953
Look son,
does she make you happy?

25:28.994 --> 25:30.723
Well, in that case,

25:30.762 --> 25:33.697
you just make sure you got
that tie on nice and tight,

25:33.732 --> 25:37.225
all buttons buttoned,
all snaps snapped.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.398
We don't want
you to ruin that picture.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.634
Yes, sir.

25:43.008 --> 25:44.498
Yes, sir.

25:49.648 --> 25:53.710
Okay, Tommy,
I need to watch my thoughts,

25:53.752 --> 25:55.720
it becomes my words.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.621
I need to watch my words,
it becomes actions,

25:58.657 --> 25:59.783
I need to watch my actions,

25:59.824 --> 26:01.849
it becomes habit.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.022
I need to watch my habits,
it becomes character.

26:05.063 --> 26:11.002
I need to watch my character,
it becomes my destiny.

26:11.036 --> 26:14.870
Gee, thanks
for the supportive ear.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.671
Tell me what to do, what to do.

26:32.357 --> 26:33.756
What if I'm not ready?

26:35.393 --> 26:37.361
What if I'm not over Dillon?

26:38.496 --> 26:39.463
Dillon.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.592
Dillon!

27:07.092 --> 27:08.526
Oh my God. I...

27:08.560 --> 27:10.790
I didn't expect
to see you here after,

27:10.829 --> 27:12.820
everything.
Yeah.

27:12.864 --> 27:20.635
Uh, Lena you know all I've ever
wanted is for you to be happy.

27:20.672 --> 27:21.662
Are you happy?

27:21.706 --> 27:22.832
Yeah.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.672
Yes, yes I am.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.609
Okay. All right fair enough.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.841
That's all that matters to me,

27:28.880 --> 27:33.477
what we had was the past.
Just know I...

27:33.518 --> 27:38.718
I always will support you
and you'll always be my angel.

27:38.757 --> 27:41.749
Um, are...
are you coming to lunch?

27:41.793 --> 27:43.591
I'll tell mom you're here,
she'd love to see you here.

27:43.628 --> 27:44.789
No.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.660
It'll be on social media
in a minute.

27:45.697 --> 27:47.426
No, no,
I don't wanna be a distraction.

27:47.465 --> 27:48.899
I'll just hang around
the guest quarters and,

27:48.933 --> 27:52.460
uh, I'll come for the ceremony,
how's that?

27:52.504 --> 27:55.064
Uh, Tricia and Brianna

27:55.106 --> 27:57.006
have already gotten into
their usual fight over Chester.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.840
If you ask me, them
two are still in love.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.608
Yeah, yeah.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.136
You never miss your water
until that water dry.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.116
When did you get
all deep and philosophical?

28:06.151 --> 28:07.482
Where's my thug?

28:07.519 --> 28:08.543
I'm still banging out

28:12.424 --> 28:14.119
Oh, and Rock and Nikki
are here too.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.524
Dillon they'd love to see you.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.860
No, I'm here to support you.

28:18.897 --> 28:21.992
I don't wanna make
anybody uncomfortable.

28:22.033 --> 28:25.162
You know I love you, right?

28:25.203 --> 28:27.001
Will I see you again?

28:27.038 --> 28:28.164
Of course.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.402
After lunch.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.466
Okay.

30:32.597 --> 30:36.033
Right here, Lena baby. Whoo-hoo!

30:36.067 --> 30:39.298
You know, you finally got
that strong foundation

30:39.337 --> 30:42.307
you wanted in your love life
I'm- and I'm happy for you.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.967
Your relationship career

30:44.008 --> 30:46.238
has been going up and down
like the stock market

30:46.277 --> 30:47.711
but you stayed in there,
you know?

30:47.745 --> 30:48.769
You got YOUR brains
beat up by some dudes

30:48.813 --> 30:50.008
that really didn't deserve you,
but you got back.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.107
You got you a good man, and
that's what's most important.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.915
You got you a good man
that cares about you,

30:54.953 --> 30:56.978
and that's what's important,
you know?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.284
'Cause let me tell you all,
she was there for me

30:58.323 --> 30:59.688
at my low point. It was dark.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.715
It was a real dark moment,

31:01.759 --> 31:04.558
especially when I got cut
from the team, yeah.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.223
Yeah, that night- yeah,
I came over there, man,

31:06.264 --> 31:09.325
and I was looking for a shoulder
to lean on,

31:09.367 --> 31:11.165
I passed her shoulder up and
landed right on them titties.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.897
Yeah, them titties. That is
definitely some good titties

31:12.937 --> 31:15.099
to lean on at a time like that,
in a crisis.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.267
You got some comfortable titties
there boy.

31:17.308 --> 31:18.332
He)', YOU got you one.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.969
Yeah, I cried on them titties.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.672
I didn't know where them titties
cam from 'till I seen them

31:21.713 --> 31:22.680
titties right there, mama.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.148
Yeah Miss Jackson, them titties

31:24.182 --> 31:25.775
are generational titties
right there and that's...

31:25.817 --> 31:27.649
that's what it's all about.

31:27.685 --> 31:28.811
Yeah, okay we messed around,

31:28.853 --> 31:31.288
we made out for about 35,
45 minutes, yeah I was hard.

31:31.322 --> 31:33.086
I was ninth grade hard.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.285
You know how hard
you get in ninth grade?

31:34.325 --> 31:36.794
Hey, you can check your blood
pressure with that it's...

31:36.828 --> 31:38.353

That's how it was, right?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.262
You remember that time? Yeah.

31:40.298 --> 31:43.199
And definitely, you know,
we trying to control ourselves,

31:43.234 --> 31:44.895
definitely used
some type of respect 'cause

31:44.936 --> 31:46.165
we could be drinking
that '45 Loco 'cause

31:46.204 --> 31:47.433
we only had three dollars from
the gas station, remember that?

31:47.472 --> 31:51.238
But my point to you is, is that
this was a moment that we had,

31:51.276 --> 31:53.108
we shared, it was hot,
it was real steamy, remember?

31:53.144 --> 31:55.112
Hey, I was gonna put
that R. Kelly on,

31:55.146 --> 31:56.307
'cause if that R. Kelly
had came on right,

31:56.347 --> 31:58.748
I'm telling you
what was gonna happen.

31:58.783 --> 31:59.875

35:05.570 --> 35:08.267
Now, I'm not dwelling
on the past all right,

35:08.306 --> 35:10.968

Ten long hours.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.576
Ten hours, 35 minutes and 21-

35:50.615 --> 35:52.413
- CORAL AND DARNELL AND DARNELL
- point six-six seconds.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.509
That's right!
I know mom, I know.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.111
Ten hours of labor.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.553
All right
but I'm far from a child now.

35:57.588 --> 36:02.287
How can you
talk to me like that?

36:02.326 --> 36:05.296
And the Oscar goes to...

36:05.329 --> 36:10.233
Look, son, would you please just
try to relax okay, I'm gonna

36:10.268 --> 36:12.259
take your momma
back on down to the shindig

36:12.303 --> 36:13.566
and uh,

36:13.604 --> 36:15.038
you just try to relax all right?

36:15.072 --> 36:16.540
It's not right.
You good?

36:16.574 --> 36:18.906
Yeah.
Come on, Coral.

36:18.943 --> 36:23.380
I'm your momma.
Coral!

36:23.414 --> 36:25.405
And you my only son,
you do me like that!

36:25.449 --> 36:26.974
You hear how he talk to me?

36:27.018 --> 36:29.316
Just be quiet
and get your butt...

36:29.353 --> 36:30.582
I feel so weak.

36:30.621 --> 36:33.613
Coral, Coral, listen.
What is wrong with you?

36:33.658 --> 36:36.218
Oh, he shouldn't be
marrying that girl.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.887
What is up with you,
you're just drama.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.920
This place, I hate it,
I hate the swimming pool,

36:39.964 --> 36:41.955
these trees, I can't wait
till my sister gets here.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.194
Oh come on what is?

36:43.234 --> 36:44.463
Oh, Jesus.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.062
What the hell
is wrong with you woman,

36:47.104 --> 36:49.129
I can't take you no damn where.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.606
Hey.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.245
Can we talk?

37:03.287 --> 37:05.847
Yeah.
Okay.

37:08.226 --> 37:15.860
<i>L“</i>

37:18.970 --> 37:21.598
Reverend, are you sure
you have to go so soon?

37:25.476 --> 37:31.279
We have more peach cobbler,
I could make you a to-go plate.

37:31.315 --> 37:34.649
You know,
you sure are a doll.

37:34.685 --> 37:42.490
Ah well, you know I gotta
be back here bright and early,

37:42.526 --> 37:45.086
or somebody's not
getting married tomorrow.

37:45.129 --> 37:49.999
Oh, don't go so soon.

37:50.034 --> 37:57.100
You know, an old man like me
needs plenty of beauty rest.

37:57.141 --> 37:59.974
I think you're beautiful
just the way you are.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.247
No but, no.

38:05.283 --> 38:11.746
You know,
we decided to take it slow.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.281
I thought you said...

38:16.727 --> 38:19.025
Honey?

38:19.063 --> 38:27.164
Huh? Oh,
that was this honey, oh, yeah.

38:35.212 --> 38:37.306
Let me help you with that.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.285
You know it's...

38:51.329 --> 38:57.427
it's only been two years
since she passed.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.300
L-I... I just...

38:59.337 --> 39:02.068
I really need to take it...

39:02.106 --> 39:04.074
move slower.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.270
I understand. I understand, I...

39:06.310 --> 39:08.745
I just don't know how long
you expect me to sit around

39:08.779 --> 39:10.338
and wait.

39:13.250 --> 39:20.122
Please, just bear with me.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.647
I'm so stupid.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.342
Hey, little momma,
you have any lotion?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.182
My knees get ashy
and I wanna wear some shorts.

39:55.159 --> 39:56.649
Where's your little friend at?

39:56.694 --> 39:59.322
Keli? Oh, she got picked up,

39:59.363 --> 40:01.559
but she'll be back tomorrow
for the wedding.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.226
Oh, okay.

40:03.267 --> 40:05.326
I know I'm officially not
your big brother until tomorrow

40:05.369 --> 40:07.804
but, uh, spit it out,
what's wrong?

40:07.838 --> 40:09.499
Nothing.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.632
No, don't nothing me.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.608
If you're not around here
looking for trouble to get

40:12.643 --> 40:16.671
into I know something's wrong
with you so, uh, so out with it.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.705
I'm serious, I'm good.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.116
I'm... I'm fine.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.745
Are you, uh,

40:22.787 --> 40:24.846
are you worried that I'm gonna
take your sister away from you?

40:24.889 --> 40:26.482
Please, take her away.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.255
Maybe then I'll get away
with more.

40:29.293 --> 40:32.752
Look I know there's
a lot going on, you know,

40:32.797 --> 40:36.461
but, uh, you gotta realizes
that sometimes change is good.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.899
Yeah, okay, okay.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.597
But what if you
don't understand?

40:40.638 --> 40:42.299
Well, sometimes God

40:42.339 --> 40:44.774
puts us on a need-to-know basis
all right, so stop worrying

40:44.809 --> 40:48.643
about where the wind is going
and just enjoy the breeze.

40:48.679 --> 40:49.840
Um, okay.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.212
Well at least that's what
my father would tell me right,

40:52.249 --> 40:54.183
I think it makes sense right?

40:54.218 --> 40:56.710
I don't know.

40:56.754 --> 40:59.485
Well, I'm glad you're gonna
be a part of our family.

40:59.523 --> 41:02.151
I'm glad you're glad.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.854
Hey, you need to go get rest up;

41:03.894 --> 41:04.861
we have a big day tomorrow.

41:04.895 --> 41:06.727
I know, I know, and,

41:06.764 --> 41:09.631
um, I'm not supposed to leave
my room for any reason, right?

41:09.667 --> 41:12.398
And if I see Selena
before tomorrow I am dead meat.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.530
Yeah, my mom
will slit your throat.

41:14.572 --> 41:15.903
Yeah, at least someone else

41:15.940 --> 41:17.533
knows what she's capable of,
right?

41:17.575 --> 41:19.441
At least we're the detectives
that know.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.411
Yeah.

41:21.445 --> 41:24.710
Well what about you,
are you okay?

41:24.748 --> 41:29.208
Um, well, I just wish that I
had a better job, you know,

41:29.253 --> 41:31.347
to take care of your sister.

41:31.388 --> 41:32.913
Well, don't waste too much time

41:32.957 --> 41:34.618
trying to figure out
where the wind is going, right?

41:34.658 --> 41:38.652
Hm. Good talk.

41:53.711 --> 41:59.150
<i>L“</i>

42:05.990 --> 42:08.960
Um, um, um.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.155
<i>Whoa-ooh.</i>

42:15.032 --> 42:17.501
It's gonna be a long,
lonely night.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.867
It's gonna be long but it damn
sure ain't gonna be lonely.

42:22.773 --> 42:24.605
What?

42:24.642 --> 42:27.577
I'm saying, I was talking
about you 'cause you with me.

42:27.611 --> 42:29.841
But that's fine.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.349
That's why they say
don't bring sand to the beach.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.751
I waited as long as I could,

42:36.787 --> 42:41.247
but you know me,
I needed someone, I-I just...

42:41.292 --> 42:42.259
Do you love him?

42:42.293 --> 42:43.852
Yeah.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.726
You know it's all in
the little things.

42:45.763 --> 42:47.561
He's so wise to be so young;

42:47.598 --> 42:48.656
I learn something new
from him every day.

42:48.699 --> 42:52.658
He's an amazing man.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.900
I waited as long as I could.
You know what,

42:55.940 --> 42:59.638
sometimes I feel like I loved
you more than you loved me.

43:06.784 --> 43:07.808
Well I'm...

43:07.851 --> 43:09.717
I'm just gonna head back up.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.482
Tomorrow's the big day.

43:11.522 --> 43:16.460
I hope to see you there,
you know you're always family.

43:16.493 --> 43:18.860
Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.456
Thank you for everything.

43:21.498 --> 43:25.799
You're an angel, Dillon,
and you deserve way better.

43:25.836 --> 43:27.930
I don't even know how to thank
you for enriching my life

43:27.972 --> 43:29.838
and changing me

43:29.873 --> 43:32.570
and opening my eyes
to so many different things.

43:32.610 --> 43:37.241
<i>L“</i>

43:42.086 --> 43:43.451
Right here, be careful.

43:54.098 --> 43:55.725
Darnell?

43:55.766 --> 43:57.666
What are you doing
out of the guesthouse?

43:57.701 --> 43:59.760
I told you to call me
if you needed anything.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.794
I'm sorry,
I got a little restless.

44:01.839 --> 44:04.809
I kinda needed something sweet.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.469
Are they gone?

44:06.510 --> 44:08.706
Are you talking
about your lovely parents?

44:08.746 --> 44:10.612
Yes, the ones
that you adore so much.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.345
You see this big smile
on my face?

44:13.384 --> 44:14.909
Well, I guess that
answers my question then.

44:14.952 --> 44:21.585
Here.

44:21.625 --> 44:22.990
Why the nerves?

44:23.027 --> 44:24.859
You're not having
second thoughts are you?

44:24.895 --> 44:26.090
No, no, never that.

44:26.130 --> 44:27.894
No, your daughter...

44:27.931 --> 44:29.865
your daughter's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.528
All right then.

44:32.569 --> 44:35.595
I want you to know I do have
a weapon in this house.

44:35.639 --> 44:37.733
Now
I see where Selena gets it from.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.436
You guys must have, like,

44:39.476 --> 44:41.774
some type of Manson gene
or something.

44:41.812 --> 44:45.043
I'm just letting you know.
Fair, fair.

44:45.082 --> 44:46.880
You know, I just wanna be
the best husband for her,

44:46.917 --> 44:48.612
you know?

44:48.652 --> 44:51.644
L, uh, I'm always thinking
of ways to make money and,

44:51.689 --> 44:55.455
uh, I just wanna be
the best provider for my family.

44:55.492 --> 45:00.089
Listen, her father left
her plenty of money.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.894
Just love her,

45:01.932 --> 45:04.731
and treat her right.
Yeah.

45:04.768 --> 45:06.736
Well no disrespect, you know,

45:06.770 --> 45:10.400
but I'm a man, and I
wanna provide for my family.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.842
Now I know she's dependent
on some trust fund,

45:12.876 --> 45:15.573
but I want my wife
to depend on me.

45:15.612 --> 45:17.979
You know,
I don't have all the money

45:18.015 --> 45:19.107
that I should be making,

45:19.149 --> 45:22.141
but I am going back to school.

45:22.186 --> 45:26.623
I just wanna be perfect
for my family.

45:26.657 --> 45:30.651
Listen, you need
to take it one day at a time.

45:30.694 --> 45:34.995
How many billionaires
have ended in divorce, hm?

45:35.032 --> 45:37.967
It's not money
that make you happy,

45:38.001 --> 45:42.632
it's how good
the relationship is.

45:42.673 --> 45:45.165
Right, I just
don't wanna mess it up.

45:45.209 --> 45:46.802
She means so much to me.

45:46.844 --> 45:49.575
With an attitude
like that I'm sure you won't.

45:49.613 --> 45:52.207
I know my daughter.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.581
Thanks, Miss Jackson.

45:54.618 --> 45:57.679
Tell you what, after tomorrow,

45:57.721 --> 46:01.624
you can go on and call me mom.
Sounds good.

46:01.658 --> 46:05.219
Now get on back
out there to that guesthouse

46:05.262 --> 46:07.856
before I do have
to use that weapon on you.

46:07.898 --> 46:08.922
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

46:08.966 --> 46:11.663
I was thinking about seeing
the crew though, uh,

46:11.702 --> 46:15.002
down at the beach.
Thank you again.

46:15.038 --> 46:22.172
<i>L“</i>

46:22.212 --> 46:24.112
You know how she is,

46:24.148 --> 46:27.140
it never changes okay, and don't
you get sucked into that.

46:27.184 --> 46:28.379
That's easy for you to say,

46:28.418 --> 46:30.853
look at you, you always have it
all together, Miss Perfect.

46:30.888 --> 46:32.652
Don't I Wish.

46:32.689 --> 46:35.590
What more could you ask for?

46:35.626 --> 46:37.890
You found love,
you have a great man.

46:37.928 --> 46:40.829
I mean Rock is so good to you.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.832
But don't think we don't go
through our own ups and downs.

46:42.866 --> 46:45.563
It's just, you know,
we work on it

46:45.602 --> 46:47.730
and we... we communicate
and we pray together.

46:47.771 --> 46:50.763
Pray together?
Yes, every day.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.072
Boo, it's changed
our relationship so much.

46:53.110 --> 46:55.772
The intimacy...

46:55.813 --> 46:58.282
the connection...it's just...
Wow.

46:58.315 --> 47:00.682
And don't get me wrong okay,

47:00.717 --> 47:03.687
some days I do wanna drop him
in the kiddie pool but,

47:03.720 --> 47:06.917
once the anger
passes I just, you know,

47:06.957 --> 47:08.982
I see him for the man
that he is, flaws and all.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.051
And I just love
him unconditionally.

47:11.094 --> 47:12.562
I wish.

47:12.596 --> 47:13.688
Don't wish okay?

47:13.730 --> 47:16.062
That love that you're looking
for, it's in your heart.

47:16.099 --> 47:18.067
Girl, you been watching
Oprah's Lifeclass or something?

47:18.101 --> 47:19.068
Well...

47:21.071 --> 47:23.267
Okay, well,

47:23.307 --> 47:29.212
what if you love someone
but they're with someone else?

47:29.246 --> 47:31.806
Ooh. Well,

47:31.849 --> 47:35.251
now I always thought you made
a big mistake by leaving him.

47:35.285 --> 47:38.311
You guys were meant for each
other but...my name is Bennett

47:38.355 --> 47:41.256
and I ain't in it.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.773
Ah, you crazy boy.

47:56.807 --> 47:59.037
But look man, for real,

47:59.076 --> 48:05.277
like, you ever thought maybe
that you chose the wrong one?

48:05.315 --> 48:09.309
Like the woman that you chose
wasn't the right fit for you?

48:09.353 --> 48:12.323
I never looked at it
as if it was my choice.

48:12.356 --> 48:14.848
I just love the woman
that God gave me,

48:14.892 --> 48:16.656
and I treat her the way
that anyone would treat a gift

48:16.693 --> 48:18.593
from God.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.223
But, the thing about it is man,
like, what if the woman

48:21.265 --> 48:22.426
that's perfect for you,

48:22.466 --> 48:24.298
the woman that God actually
made for you, was out there

48:24.334 --> 48:25.859
and you're not with her?

48:25.903 --> 48:27.667
Like, man,
you've chosen some other woman

Ah, beautiful.

49:09.713 --> 49:11.943
I'm worried, Rock.

49:11.982 --> 49:16.249
Come on man, what's it gonna be,
fear or fate?

49:16.286 --> 49:19.916
They can't be in the same space
together, just like my parents.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.823
Look, I just wanna
provide for her, you know?

49:21.858 --> 49:24.088
My father provided for us.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.356
We lived a good life, man.

49:25.395 --> 49:28.990
I just don't wanna let her down
like her father did, you know?

49:29.032 --> 49:31.729
Her dad
was a great business man.

49:31.768 --> 49:32.997
He built that company
from the ground

49:33.036 --> 49:35.004
up into a huge corporation.

49:35.038 --> 49:36.733
He just got greedy.

49:36.773 --> 49:40.209
Yeah, and it hurt her deeply.

49:40.243 --> 49:43.440
Well, unless you know something
I don't know, I...

49:43.480 --> 49:44.970

Rock,

49:55.459 --> 49:57.018

promise to keep it between us,

49:57.060 --> 49:59.791
Fight?

50:00.831 --> 50:01.923
It's possible.

50:05.936 --> 50:09.736
L, um...

50:09.773 --> 50:12.071
I lost my job.

50:12.109 --> 50:16.012
I haven't told anyone
that I lost it on Friday.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.772
Damn, my goodness.

50:18.815 --> 50:19.782
Exactly

50:23.020 --> 50:27.821
My old man used to tell us,
when God closes one door,

50:27.858 --> 50:29.223
He opens another.

50:29.259 --> 50:31.887
I'm sure there's something else
in store for you.

50:31.928 --> 50:35.922
Don't be afraid
to turn the page.

50:37.834 --> 50:40.997
I'm gonna head up
and check on Bria.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.767
Tomorrow's your big day.

50:42.806 --> 50:44.240

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

This one a little too active,

that's the one right there.
No, that one.

51:52.409 --> 51:54.173
I don't want it,
no, it's hideous.

51:54.211 --> 51:55.872
No, that's the one.

51:55.912 --> 51:58.006
No, I wanna puppy not a turtle.

51:58.048 --> 51:59.482
You wanna puppy?

51:59.516 --> 52:03.111
Okay, I know, you wanna puppy
but, I want a turtle.

52:03.153 --> 52:05.451
You are so bossy, why?

52:05.489 --> 52:07.958
'Cause,
you gotta learn to slow down.

52:07.991 --> 52:10.016
You're constantly rushing
in life, constantly

52:10.060 --> 52:11.255
I'm efficient.
Okay.

52:11.294 --> 52:13.058
But sometimes you gotta
take a beat,

52:13.096 --> 52:16.122
feel the land, look
at the stars.

52:16.166 --> 52:17.463
Taste your food for godsakes.

52:17.501 --> 52:20.095
Now you know I taste my food.
Okay.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.469
But they'll live way longer
then we can,

52:22.506 --> 52:25.237
and they'll always remind
you to slow down a little

52:25.275 --> 52:27.471
and enjoy your life.

52:27.511 --> 52:28.478
You only get one.

52:28.512 --> 52:32.847
They're ugly,
why would I want more than one?

52:32.883 --> 52:40.290
One life, one turtle. Let's go.
Ugh.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.663
a grown-ass woman
acting like a little girl.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.862
You really need
to grow up 'cause it's not cute.

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:27.893
And if you're not a woman,

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.996
you're never gonna
attract a man.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.872
And if you're so grown
and such a woman,

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.673
why can't you
please your man huh?

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.235
Too uptight?

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:38.873
He said that I'm still the best.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.444
Yeah?

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:44.784
If you're so good, then how come
when he was done with you,

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.846
he came downstairs to me?
Bitch.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:49.017
Ow! Jesus,

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.992
is this what you wanna do?

01:03:58.801 --> 01:03:59.927
OW! Oh.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:07.668
Just wait a second...

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.178
I definitely could have just
whipped your ass, I just-

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.737
Oh, my God.
-I've been smoking.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.875
Okay, please. Oh my God, Trisha,

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.714
I really think I popped a disc
or something.

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.812
I feel like I'm about 60.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.586
If I was 21
you know I would have had you.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:24.093
If we were both 21
you know I would have had you.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.294
You know, I'm sorry.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:32.290
It was the gin,
you know gin will make you sin.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:37.102
Trisha, you know
that's not good enough, right?

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:41.906
I know.

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:45.608
You love him, right?

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.241
Yeah.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.212
He loves you, you know?

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:56.590
I know that,
that's why I act the way I do.

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:58.856
I'm not even mad you know that?

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.926
I just feel sad.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.693
You know,
I've been sad for awhile now.

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.333
Trish, I miss you.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.037
We used to be friends.

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:22.041
I am sick
and tired of your momma,

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.018
and if you want commissary
on your books, you're gonna

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.215
have to tell her to do it.

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:30.192
I am sick of her telling me
what to do.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:33.196
And this place creeps me out.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.703
Hey, ma.

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.237
Selena, it's your father.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.350
He wanted to talk to you
before the wedding.

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:16.728
Selena?

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.797
It's me.

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:23.870
Boy, you sound...

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.314
you sound so grown up.

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:30.217
That's because I'm a woman
now, dad.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:35.349
Yeah, I guess you are.
Look, I'm...

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:40.420
I just wanna apologize.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.956
You know,
I wasn't able to be the father

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.197
that you needed me to be,

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:52.003
you know, and so... lt's just
circumstances, you know?

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.240
It's what I had to do, you know?

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.440
I had to keep things
on the outside;

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.109
it was the only way
I could survive.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.085
I survived just fine
without you dad, just fine.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.953
I just wanna, um...
Now you listen to me.

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.083
Don't ever call here again;

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.753
we did just fine without you.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:15.025
You know, your mother
sends me pictures of you.

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:20.867
Every single week
for the last 16 years. I...

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:25.431
I just... I want you to know
that I love you,

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.444
and I think about you every day.

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:31.310
Dad, that's...
that's not good enough.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:34.282
Listen, I know that I've made
some terrible mistakes.

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:36.478
You listen to me.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.783

I wanna go over some details
of the reception.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.067
I was thinking for that table

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.541
we could put small bottles
of champagne.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:35.738
Okay, I'll talk to you about it
later, my guests are here.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.937
Good morning.
Morning.

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.210
Good morning.

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:44.345
Well, you all are here bright
and early this glorious morning.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.082
I am usually up at 0600
every morning, Melanie.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.386
Well, it's gonna
be a glorious day.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:52.053
Yes, it is.
And what a glorious, snug dress.

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.323
Did you just
call me fat?

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.024
Oh, no.
Oh no, I.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.430
Babe, no.
You see I tried.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.524
I always seem to say
the wrong thing.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.899
I just meant that we were gonna

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:05.237
ask you to give us a hand
around here and your dress

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.537
might be a bit snug
to give us some help.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.170
It's no problem.
Do I look like the help to you?

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.340
Oh, come on.
Excuse me?

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.372
Uh, I am tired of this.
Baby.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:17.386
Just because your ex-husband
left a few dollars

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:18.648
hidden around here,

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:22.988
you all up in this fancy house
wearing these old fancy clothes,

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:24.356
don't mean
you can order us around like we

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.359
some common people.

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.089
Coral, I...
No!

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.961
I didn't mean that, I was only-

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.227
You were only trying

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.462
to turn your nose up to us
like you always do.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:36.165
I'm sick of it.

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.573
I can't believe our son fell for
this whole charade around here.

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:41.406
You ain't nothing but a fraud.
Baby, come on.

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:44.504
Mm-hm. And you're living
over here on borrowed time

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:48.176
while your children's
daddy's doing time.

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:51.209
Surviving off some little
earnings of some thief.

01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:52.220
Thief?
Coral!

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.551
Damn right!

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.489
Then maybe you feel that way,
you should leave.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.889
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.520
Well, fine. I'll leave.

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.326
And I'm gonna tell my son
why we left too.

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.092
You do that.
Damn right. Come on.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.190
No, no, come on, now baby.
We ain't wanted here.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.291
Now baby, Coral wait minute!

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.460
Get in this car.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.596
I... I'm... I'm sorry I-

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:11.004
My husband worked hard.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.441
Yes he may have made
a few mistakes,

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:15.671
but he's a good man.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.114
And he paid all of those people
back.

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.173
My husband worked hard,

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.912
she has no...
I'm...

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.647
No right to talk to me
like that.

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:27.554
I am so, so sorry, Melanie,

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.423
I- I'm... I'm sorry,
okay I'm sorry.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.496
How dare she.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:45.040
You all finish the decorations,
carry on.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:50.174
I'll talk to you
more about it later, McKenzie.

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:53.204
I need a vacation.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.986
I hope you didn't apologize
to that woman for me.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:06.495
If we get started now
we can be home by noon.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:10.590
You know, I am just about sick

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:13.728
and tired of you
and your dramatic tirades.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.739
What? What?

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.740
Coral, I...
I can't take any more of this.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.674
I mean, the way
you spoke to that woman

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:23.406
was disrespectful
and absolutely ignorant.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.209
Well, she deserved it.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:27.614
She does not like us.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:31.609
Woman, do not say another word,
okay?

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:33.748
Now listen, I love you,

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.621
but you act like you've never
made a mistake

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.716
before in your life.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:41.560
Now look, come here,
this... this is about our son.

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:44.589
You raised that boy, everything
that you see in there,

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:47.102
100% of what you raised
is in there.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.662
Baby, that is all you,
you did that.

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.702
Lena, it's me.

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:59.313
Girl, open up or I will go
start a fire in the kitchen,

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.043
and you know I will.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.448
What?

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.146
Look, you have all
of your guests waiting.

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:06.052
And not only that,

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:08.580
but there is a wonderful,
gorgeous man

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:10.786
down there who loves you
to pieces.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:13.761
You're a lucky girl.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:16.959
All right, that's it,
I'm getting the matches.

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.427
What are you doing?

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.406
You need to stop
blocking your happiness.

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.238
Look, it's okay.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.308
It's okay to let go.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.979
It's okay to move on, you know?

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.184
What's the problem?

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:48.720
Why are you still having issues
moving on?

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:51.426
It's so hard.

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:54.368
I still love him so much.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:55.666
I know.

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:58.765
And I get it, trust me.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.504
But.

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:05.070
Look, sometimes people are only
in your life for a season.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:08.744
And you gotta close one chapter
so you can open the next

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:14.348
so you can see
how your story unfolds, right?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.223
Trish, I'm scared.

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:22.356
I'm scared that I won't be able
to be a good wife to him.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.561
Darnell is such an amazing guy
and he deserves so much better.

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.467
What? Stop.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:33.374
Please, do you not know
how amazing you are?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:38.347
It gets no better.
You always know what to say.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.644
Well, sometimes.
Yeah, sorta.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:43.708
Look, I didn't smoke today
so I'm on point.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.584
Come here.

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.282
Come here.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.288

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.163
I love you too.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.634
I'll go keep them on ice.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.578
Now you know you too young
to be drinking,

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.376
