04:05.854 --> 04:08.465
If the doctor
did not hide the heart,

04:08.552 --> 04:10.902
there would be no proof
the people of Sverdlovsk,

04:10.989 --> 04:12.339
died from anthrax.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.168
The victims did not die
from tainted meat like

04:16.256 --> 04:18.214
the Soviet government claims.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.564
They were exposed to
a biological weapon.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.525
<i>SOKOLOV : </i>
Test it yourself.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.091
You see
that pale area there,

04:26.178 --> 04:27.528
that's bacterial overgrowth,

04:27.615 --> 04:29.530
could be endocarditis.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.445
<i>SOKOLOV : All other </i>
evidence was destroyed.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.098
Under whose authority?

04:33.185 --> 04:35.144
The Kremlin.

04:35.231 --> 04:38.974
And you can confirm
this man was killed by an

04:39.061 --> 04:40.889
incident at Compound 19?

04:40.976 --> 04:43.544
He worked in
a ceramic factory next door.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.937
The contaminated
cloud drifted for miles,

04:46.024 --> 04:47.548
killed everyone in its path,

04:47.635 --> 04:50.812
men, women, children.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.205
We were lucky the wind
did not head toward town or

04:53.293 --> 04:56.731
300,000 people would be dead.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.994
What's the
Russian government doing
with all that anthrax?

05:00.996 --> 05:03.128
My understanding
was to attach it to

05:03.215 --> 05:07.045
warheads for SS-18 ICBMs.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.787
<i>LAWSON : How many </i>
pounds could you produce?

05:09.874 --> 05:14.488
<i>SOKOLOV : In each </i>
year, about 300 pounds,

05:14.575 --> 05:16.925
<i>aerosolized spores.</i>

05:17.012 --> 05:18.666
How bad?

05:18.753 --> 05:21.364
RYKER: 300 pounds,
that's just from one plant?

05:21.451 --> 05:23.410
Uh, we produce
a little for vaccines but

05:23.497 --> 05:26.674
that amount
could kill billions.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.719
We need to know
the virulence and...

05:28.806 --> 05:31.331
<i>RYKER : The </i>
location of the stockpiles.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.985
If they're
going to offer you asylum,

05:34.072 --> 05:37.162
they'll need more.

05:37.249 --> 05:40.035
Exact formulas, locations,

05:40.122 --> 05:43.255
proof that Russia
broke our treaty.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.171
Of course, of course.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.218
But if you think that the
attack will come from Russia,

05:49.305 --> 05:51.089
you are looking
in the wrong place.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.571
<i>SOKOLOV : </i>
America has many enemies.

05:54.658 --> 05:57.487
<i>Soviets sell </i>
bioweapons to them because

05:57.574 --> 06:00.011
<i>any enemy of America </i>
is a friend to Russia.

06:02.884 --> 06:06.496
<i>I am here to warn you, </i>
an attack is inevitable.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.584
We're almost there.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.807
Difficulty breathing,
vitals unstable.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.374
BP 60 over 40.

06:58.461 --> 06:59.331
0.3 milligrams
of epinephrine.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.724
Any heart issues?

07:00.811 --> 07:02.509
No.
He's pretty active.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.772
I brought him in because
he was vomiting all night,

07:04.859 --> 07:06.904
had a headache
for two days, uh.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.037
He's been sweating a lot,
drenched his clothes,

07:09.124 --> 07:10.560
the sheets.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.866
And then he got
really confused and

07:11.953 --> 07:13.215
didn't know where he was.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.130
Usually when he gets the flu,

07:15.217 --> 07:17.349
it just passes
in a day or two.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.177
This doesn't
present like the flu.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.135
Get Dr. Bush down here.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.791
But they just
took down two skyscrapers and

07:23.878 --> 07:26.968
public health faces a
threat no one's talking about.

07:27.055 --> 07:27.969
They know our
airport security

07:28.056 --> 07:30.188
has increased.

07:30.275 --> 07:33.714
Hell, the hijackers
took flight lessons
in crop-dusting planes.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.759
Just one outfitted
with a biological or

07:35.846 --> 07:37.979
chemical weapon could
take out the whole county.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.981
Why aren't they grounded?

07:40.068 --> 07:43.288
We've got dusters flying all
over this place for mosquitos.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.425
Excuse me a minute.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.122
Back to the slides.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.646
As you can see here,
Miami Dade County should

07:52.733 --> 07:54.952
be expecting a
spike in infections.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.750
This is
Officer Clemons.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.494
From where?

08:18.323 --> 08:20.238
What do you think
the likelihood is?

08:20.325 --> 08:22.153
The patient's spinal
fluid showed rod-like bacteria,

08:22.240 --> 08:23.111
<i>MALECKI : </i>
Looked like bamboo sticks.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.939
Sally?

08:25.026 --> 08:27.202
<i>MALECKI : </i>
Stain was gram positive.

08:27.289 --> 08:31.162
So we
could be talking some
lethal cereus or, or anthrax.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.164
And the patient?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.339
<i>MALECKI : </i>
Blood pressure bottomed-out.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.863
Organs are failing.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.125
Still don't have an
affirmative result,

08:37.212 --> 08:39.475
but considering...

08:39.562 --> 08:40.998
<i>MALECKI : </i>
I thought you should
be in the loop.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.870
Does the
guy work in agriculture?

08:42.957 --> 08:44.915
Don't know.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.222
I'm hoping his
wife can retrace his
last 48 hours for me.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.052
Do you think this could
have been intentional?

08:51.139 --> 08:53.620
In a
cushy retirement town?

08:53.707 --> 08:54.882
<i>CLEMONS : </i>
With all the fake threats
we've been fielding,

08:54.969 --> 08:56.623
<i>there's a better shot it's...</i>

08:56.710 --> 08:57.972
It's an infection
from a natural cause.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.193
Look, um...

09:02.280 --> 09:05.153
I hate to open the door
but you better call the FBI.

09:43.887 --> 09:47.369
- Hey, Agent Ryker.
- Hey.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.155
Let's get these new samples
over to USAMRIID for testing

09:51.242 --> 09:53.288
as soon as possible.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.159
Thought you
sent the last of the
samples over days ago.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.161
Uh, they just finished
shoring up the new section.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.424
I got new access.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.166
Well, I'm glad
you're the one dealing
with Copak and not me.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.603
But there's something new.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.692
We got a call from Florida.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.358
The cell
outside Dallas?

10:20.445 --> 10:22.186
We're using FISA
but no specific threat

10:22.273 --> 10:23.971
has surfaced so far.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.668
What about
the three in Chicago?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.365
We're working
on flipping one member,

10:27.452 --> 10:29.106
brother's heading to
prison so we have leverage.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.630
Picked up comm
from Afghanistan,

10:30.717 --> 10:32.283
trying to trace it.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.155
Trying?

10:34.242 --> 10:35.722
It was sent through
a series of servers, sir.

10:35.809 --> 10:36.810
It makes it hard to track.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.120
You go
home last night, Polk?

10:45.993 --> 10:49.474
How about you, Hale? Reilly?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.652
Because Mueller inherited this
Charlie Foxtrot a week before

10:52.739 --> 10:55.437
the towers came down
and I guarantee he didn't

10:55.524 --> 10:56.960
go home last night.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.834
Damn it, find a connection.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.487
Follow it!

11:02.574 --> 11:04.620
You boys need a refresher?

11:04.707 --> 11:08.406
Waco, Ruby Ridge?
We've let this country down.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.890
Find these sons of bitches.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.415
Bring us up to speed on
the suspected cell in Jersey.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.939
What?

11:19.026 --> 11:20.549
I just got
a call from Florida.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.159
They're tracking a
possible anthrax attack.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.164
Might not be a hoax this time.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.340
I was thinking I would take
a team and head down there.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.255
You have
a definitive test?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.954
We have a preliminary
CSF stain gram-positive for

11:34.041 --> 11:35.346
rod-like bacteria.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.087
English.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.699
It proves it was
a bacterial infection.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.483
That's gonna take a while
before any of our labs come

11:41.570 --> 11:43.311
back with an
actual anthrax read,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.269
but we don't have any
time to waste if this is

11:45.356 --> 11:47.228
the first indicator
of a biological attack.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.186
Like the one in Toledo?

11:49.273 --> 11:51.667
Turned out to be talcum powder
and what was that other one?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.496
College jock wrote
anthrax on his protein powder

11:54.583 --> 11:55.802
so his roommates
wouldn't use it.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.286
The patient
lives in Boca Raton.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.595
Just 'cause
two hijackers lived there

12:06.682 --> 12:08.118
doesn't mean
there's a connection.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.077
That's too
much of a coincidence.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.819
Listen, the CDC's
already on its way down there.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.472
I need to get on
the ground before

12:14.559 --> 12:16.257
the press gets wind of
it and stirs up panic.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.867
About time the
CDC carried their weight on

12:17.954 --> 12:19.695
these damn hoaxes!

12:19.782 --> 12:21.828
We're fielding two,
300 a week.

12:21.915 --> 12:26.180
Look, Ryker, these SOBs are
fly-a-plane-into-a-skyscraper

12:26.267 --> 12:28.356
kind of terrorists.

12:28.443 --> 12:32.839
They're not gonna
sprinkle magic dust on
some guy in BFE Florida.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.231
We're thin here.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.929
Sit down.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.365
All right.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.410
Jersey, what do you got?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.499
Last week they
bought some burner phones

12:41.586 --> 12:43.588
close to a dozen, sir.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.766
They're running
their names off known
watch lists as we speak.

12:46.853 --> 12:47.810
We're expecting to get a hit.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.087
Dr. Simon Kurz.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.263
Dr. Kurz, this
is Special Agent Ryker.

13:06.350 --> 13:10.702
Listen, uh, thanks
for jumping on those
Pentagon samples, but, um,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.052
I need a favor.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.923
<i>KURZ : No problem.</i>

13:14.010 --> 13:15.751
I have some tissue
samples being flown up to a

13:15.838 --> 13:17.927
few labs from Florida, one
of them is coming to you and

13:18.014 --> 13:19.799
should arrive within the hour.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.801
I need you to take a look.

13:21.888 --> 13:22.976
<i>KURZ : </i>
Of course, Agent Ryker.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.281
We'll get right on it.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.327
<i>RYKER : Thanks.</i>

13:26.414 --> 13:28.285
Bruce, we
got some samples
coming in from Florida.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.852
Not it!

13:29.939 --> 13:31.245
But they need
the anthrax expert.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.942
Oh, I don't know.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.291
This bench is getting
awfully comfortable.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.553
If you're
pulling me off of it,

13:35.640 --> 13:37.164
I'm gonna need a new uniform,

13:37.251 --> 13:38.992
maybe a nice,
new pair of Chucks.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.950
At least
ask for Nike Shox.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.082
Are those all the rage?

13:44.432 --> 13:46.826
Yeah, no
one's worn Chucks since
before the three-point line.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.566
Really?

13:48.653 --> 13:51.308
It wasn't me who
benched you on anthrax.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.354
I know that!

13:53.441 --> 13:55.747
It was those suits
in Washington that
are full of baloney,

13:55.835 --> 13:59.403
blaming Gulf War Syndrome
on everything but the Gulf.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.666
Easy to point fingers at a
vaccine when symptoms could

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
have been caused by
myriad factors in the field.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.934
I just spent 20 years
working on piddly little
things called breakthroughs,

14:08.021 --> 14:10.675
antibiotic post-exposure
prophylaxis.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.026
And my personal favorite,
a recombinant-protective

14:13.113 --> 14:15.898
antigen vaccine they
don't even wanna fund!

14:15.985 --> 14:19.293
Bruce, can
you just run the test?

14:19.380 --> 14:22.078
- Of course I can.
- Thank you.

14:22.165 --> 14:25.516
You can just put my
Nike Shox in the locker room.

14:44.579 --> 14:48.061
- Mrs. Stevens?
- Yes.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.193
Do you have a minute?

14:50.280 --> 14:54.632
We'd
driven to see our
daughter in North Carolina.

14:54.719 --> 14:58.680
And Bob
seemed healthy before
he reached Carolina?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.595
Completely.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.946
On the drive, we were planning
our anniversary party.

15:04.033 --> 15:07.210
He was excited to have
all the kids together again.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.777
Any
stops along the way?

15:10.518 --> 15:14.217
A
diner on Highway 26.

15:14.304 --> 15:18.743
Did he eat any
strange food, unusual game?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.485
Just pastrami.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.532
Any other stops?

15:26.882 --> 15:29.363
We did
a little shopping.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.321
Some dress shoes.

15:31.408 --> 15:34.063
- Were they leather?
- Yes.

15:36.109 --> 15:41.201
It's a big anniversary
and I was determined

15:41.288 --> 15:43.203
not to have him in
a suit and sneakers.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.467
Do you know if
the shoes were handmade?

15:46.554 --> 15:48.643
Where they came from?

15:48.730 --> 15:52.125
No, but how
could he have caught
something from shoes?

15:52.212 --> 15:56.564
Bacteria in
livestock can be present
on byproducts, leather, wool.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.306
Coming into contact
with those products
can cause an infection.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.744
Did he pet any animals,

16:02.831 --> 16:04.267
a dog maybe?

16:04.354 --> 16:06.487
Walk through a pasture?

16:06.574 --> 16:12.014
We went
for a hike with our
daughter up to Chimney Rock.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.668
Did he eat or
drink anything on the hike?

16:19.239 --> 16:22.503
I told him
not to drink the water,

16:22.590 --> 16:25.027
but he didn't listen.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.638
We'll have a
local field team do a sweep
of the trail on the stream,

16:27.725 --> 16:30.250
see if we can find the
origin of the infection.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.427
What is this?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.429
The doctors haven't
given me an update.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.867
We're not sure.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.567
He's going to be
all right though, isn't he?

17:00.367 --> 17:02.108
Matthew?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.680
Last beer, you mind?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.378
Uh-uh.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.641
I only get them for you, so,

17:13.728 --> 17:16.557
usually stock up
for a bi-monthly visit,

17:16.644 --> 17:19.473
but four nights this week.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.691
Too much?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.913
Just unusual.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.310
Eodi gasseo?

17:30.397 --> 17:33.661
What?

17:33.748 --> 17:36.968
Just looks like you
have a lot going on up there.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.579
Yeah.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.060
Nobody wants
to talk to a lobbyist.

17:41.147 --> 17:46.369
I know that you're
not big on chit-chat,
but I could wait you out.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.070
What was that, um,

17:51.157 --> 17:53.072
thing in Korean
you said earlier?

17:53.159 --> 17:57.467
Um, eodi gasseo?
Taught you that one before.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.730
Where did you go?

18:01.689 --> 18:04.779
We had warning signs
that 9/11 was going to happen.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.131
Matthew.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.830
Names, addresses even.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.658
The FBI, well
they watch over, what,

18:14.745 --> 18:17.357
thousands of
potential terrorists?

18:17.444 --> 18:20.316
A lot of
these guys were flagged.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.405
Memos were sent at
high levels back in August.

18:22.492 --> 18:27.280
Bin Laden might strike,
likely using planes.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.673
There was a flight academy in
Minnesota that alerted us that

18:29.760 --> 18:32.546
Moussaoui was
taking flying lessons.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.200
Jesus.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.028
Al-Mihdhar
was on a CIA watchlist,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.247
but there was an
agency tug-of-war.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.555
The FAA wasn't warned in time.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.471
It's on and on.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.996
They all walked
right through security.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.655
How much
of this did you know?

18:54.742 --> 18:57.048
I didn't.

18:57.136 --> 19:02.532
Hey, we are all
bleeding a little, okay?

19:02.619 --> 19:03.751
A lot.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.231
After what I saw I...

19:06.971 --> 19:08.799
It can't happen again.

19:08.886 --> 19:13.413
Matthew, you are not
responsible for any of this.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.765
You are not
the only one that's
supposed to see things coming.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.854
But what
if I do this time?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.551
And no one listens?

19:35.652 --> 19:38.002
Ryker.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.743
I know, Robert.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.005
We're just
overstretched and...

19:46.054 --> 19:49.797
Yes, yes, of
course we all are.

19:57.283 --> 20:02.157
I was hoping to have the
comm report today, but, uh...

20:03.376 --> 20:05.116
Team needs more time...

20:21.350 --> 20:22.395
Once we arrive
at the Stevens house,

20:22.482 --> 20:23.831
we'll suit up in here.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.354
Then we'll go
into the back door.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.443
The less attention
we draw, the better.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.880
Possible
contact point here.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.322
Okay,
this surface is good.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.462
Soon as we
fill the first box,

20:46.549 --> 20:48.334
get it over to the county lab.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.727
We gotta see where the anthrax
is reading the hottest.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.512
Track down its origin.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.470
Anthrax causes
a systemic cytokine response

20:54.557 --> 20:56.429
called apoptosis.

20:56.516 --> 20:59.649
Cell death,
programmed cell death.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.782
It uses its host
as a live incubator.

21:01.869 --> 21:02.826
And you catch it too late,

21:02.913 --> 21:04.524
it's 100% lethal.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.787
What are the
chances that you're wrong,

21:06.874 --> 21:09.311
that this wasn't
a planned attack?

21:09.398 --> 21:12.662
Just a natural infection
from environmental sources?

21:12.749 --> 21:16.449
Sure, they can
lie dormant in the dirt
for 100, maybe 200 years.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.494
But the last
natural human infection on

21:18.581 --> 21:21.454
American soil was
almost 30 years ago.

21:21.541 --> 21:25.458
And 95% of confirmed cases
worldwide are cutaneous,

21:25.545 --> 21:28.722
which means it gets into
a cut or someone touches it.

21:28.809 --> 21:33.030
But Bob Stevens inhaled it,
which is insanely rare,

21:33.117 --> 21:36.643
unless it's
aerosolized intentionally.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.035
Intentionally?

21:38.122 --> 21:39.602
What do you...

21:39.689 --> 21:42.388
Weaponized? Against
a small beach town?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.042
So I looked into
the hijackers from Florida.

21:45.129 --> 21:49.743
And one of them, al-Haznawi,

21:49.830 --> 21:51.614
according to a
local ER doctor,

21:51.701 --> 21:54.748
had a cut he claimed,
"Would not heal."

21:58.665 --> 22:02.103
The doctor also said
that the skin around it

22:02.190 --> 22:05.498
had turned black, like this.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.978
These are anthrax lesions.

22:08.065 --> 22:11.634
So probably Haznawi
was handling the stuff.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.201
And now it strikes
in the same place only

22:13.288 --> 22:14.985
three weeks after 9/11?

22:15.072 --> 22:17.727
That can't be a coincidence.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.642
I have to find who did this.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.775
And why Bob Stevens
was the target.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.352
Do you
remember the view, Bob?

22:35.136 --> 22:37.921
I'd never seen
Fall colors so beautiful.

22:38.008 --> 22:38.966
Oh!

22:40.794 --> 22:44.363
And this, I just tripped
and you grabbed my arm!

22:46.190 --> 22:47.366
Hey Mom, I can
do that for a while, huh?

22:47.453 --> 22:49.324
Oh.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.979
Oh!

22:52.066 --> 22:54.982
Aw.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.027
I'd like to speak
to herself, if that's okay?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.566
Who are those people?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.611
Hospital
administration.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.352
Why would they...

23:17.439 --> 23:19.572
What's happening?

23:19.659 --> 23:21.704
They wanna be
certain Bob's getting
everything he needs.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.621
Is he
going to survive?

23:25.708 --> 23:28.058
We're
making every effort.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.539
Now I know you're
going to wanna go home,

23:30.626 --> 23:32.759
get some rest,
get something to eat.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.762
So they've arranged
for you to have this.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.417
If there's any change
in Bob's condition,

23:38.504 --> 23:42.203
the hospital will
contact you immediately.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.161
You know
what it is, don't you?

23:46.729 --> 23:50.385
Are you going to tell me
what's really going on here?

23:50.472 --> 23:55.564
Bob was
exposed to a bacteria
called bacillus anthracis.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.087
Anthrax.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.698
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Stevens.

24:00.830 --> 24:06.140
Oh.
When did you all know?

24:06.227 --> 24:09.622
We had some
indications yesterday,
but we wanted confirmation.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.407
If, if we'd been wrong,
it wouldn't have been fair.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.757
He's my husband!

24:14.844 --> 24:16.890
I understand
what you must be feeling.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.458
But the
information was limited to
a small circle of people.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.507
Well, I, I thought it only
right that you know before

24:25.594 --> 24:27.770
everyone else finds out.

24:27.857 --> 24:30.207
Everyone else?

24:30.294 --> 24:32.993
<i>THOMPSON : </i>
Uh, the Centers for
Disease Control has just

24:33.080 --> 24:37.780
<i>confirmed the diagnosis </i>
of anthrax in a patient
in a Florida hospital.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.956
<i>REPORTER : </i>
We were given,

24:40.043 --> 24:42.829

this is a result of terror?

24:42.916 --> 24:45.614
<i>THOMPSON : </i>
It appears that this
is just an isolated case.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.442
<i>There's no </i>
evidence of terrorism.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.357
Hi, Mom.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.750
Hey listen, I just wanted
to call and let you know that

24:50.837 --> 24:51.925
I'm not gonna be
able to make it to

24:52.012 --> 24:53.622
dinner tomorrow night, uh,

24:53.709 --> 24:56.364
or to Devon's game.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.453
<i>WOMAN : Oh! </i>
He's really gonna miss you
cheering in those stands.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.891
You know,
you have really stepped
up with his dad away.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.850
Will you
fill in for me?

25:03.937 --> 25:05.591
<i>WOMAN : Of course! </i>
Is everything okay?

25:05.678 --> 25:06.809
I'm just in the
middle of something at work.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.289
God, you work so hard.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.812
Always have.

25:09.899 --> 25:11.248
But listen, uh,
I gotta go, uh,

25:11.335 --> 25:12.423
I gotta catch a
plane to Florida.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.861
I'll call you when I get...

25:14.948 --> 25:16.471
<i>WOMAN : </i>
Florida? Is that about
that anthrax thing?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.517

Dammit!

few more hours lead time?

<i>THOMPSON : </i>
Investigating with the
FBI all known places.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.420
Okay, well, get what
you can before every news van

25:52.507 --> 25:54.683
in the state descends on us.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.729
This soon after 9/11?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.295
Seems early to
rule out terrorism.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.036
All right.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.255
They specifically
mentioned an inhalation case.

26:01.342 --> 26:02.996
O'CONNOR: Mm-hmm.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.693
What other forms
of infection are there?

26:04.780 --> 26:07.609
And symptoms, beyond
those that mimic the flu?

26:07.696 --> 26:10.656
I need odds of recovery,
history of outbreaks.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.092
Everything you can get me,

26:12.179 --> 26:13.659
especially if it
involves Al Qaeda.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.052
O'CONNOR: Yes, Mr. Brokaw.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.141
<i>THOMPSON : </i>
We don't know that
at this point in time.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.100
<i>That's entirely possible.</i>

26:20.187 --> 26:23.799
<i>We do know that he drank </i>
water out of a stream, uh,

26:23.886 --> 26:25.540
<i>when he was traveling to...</i>

26:25.627 --> 26:27.977
Oh, yeah it had
to be inhalation anthrax.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.979
Yessiree.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.286
Because somehow, my advanced
background in science has not

26:32.373 --> 26:37.639
afforded me the ability
to distinguish between
inhaling and drinking.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.728
Any sixth grader can tell you,

26:39.815 --> 26:42.688
you can't get
inhalation anthrax
from sipping creek water!

26:42.775 --> 26:44.864
Bruce, I think you've
got a future in politics.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.083
Or stand-up.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.607
Doesn't it
drive you crazy hearing
this kind of malarkey?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.347
It shocks you
that the politicals on

26:50.434 --> 26:52.175
the Hill confused their facts?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.829
Chances of only one
person coming down with an

26:53.916 --> 26:56.136
inhalation case
are slim to none.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.660
You are
absolutely correct, Jody.

26:58.747 --> 27:02.011
"Jodyness is
next to godliness."

27:02.098 --> 27:04.884
We are of one mind.

27:04.971 --> 27:09.889
If it's in the air,
there's no way this guy's
the only one breathing it.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.804
Unless he's a total hermit.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.370
<i>THOMPSON : </i>
Very aggressive.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.459
<i>And I wanna </i>
point out once again,

27:15.546 --> 27:18.811
<i>this is an isolated case, </i>
and it's not contagious.

Hey, did someone just
pass you guys in the hallway?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.220
No,
didn't see anyone.

Jean Malecki.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.614
Palm Beach County
Health Department.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.442
Matthew Ryker,

28:25.529 --> 28:28.141
I'm over here.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.925
Any change
in Stevens' condition?

28:30.012 --> 28:31.622
He's in a coma.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.015
Don't quite know
how to tell his wife

28:33.102 --> 28:34.930
he's not likely
to come out of it.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.019
That press conference
didn't help things.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.934
Well, the White House
was just trying to get out

28:39.021 --> 28:40.980
in front of
the press vultures
to curb public panic.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.155
Good luck
with that these days.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.243
Yeah.

28:43.330 --> 28:44.723
Is Stevens on Cipro?

28:44.810 --> 28:46.855
As soon
as he was admitted,

28:46.942 --> 28:49.510
but the infection
was pretty advanced
by the time he came in.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.468
I'll have you there in 30.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.122
We're going
to the hospital?

28:53.209 --> 28:55.821
We need
to check on Stevens.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.388
And CDC's already testing
everything at his home.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.739
They're not
gonna find anything.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.524
I need you to drop
me at this address.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.395
Leisure Village?

29:05.482 --> 29:07.267
I looked
into Bob Stevens.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.834
There's absolutely nothing
in his background that would

29:08.921 --> 29:11.837
make him a
target for anything.

29:11.924 --> 29:14.013
Except that he works
at <i>AMI Publishing.</i>

29:14.100 --> 29:15.536
You know, those tabloids,

29:15.623 --> 29:17.190
<i>The Sun, </i>
The National Inquirer.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.975
We found a
connection between <i>AMI</i> and

29:20.062 --> 29:22.151
two of the 9/11 hijackers.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.153
You think
this is Al Qaeda?

29:29.724 --> 29:31.030
Afternoon.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.509
I'm Special Agent
Matthew Ryker.

29:32.596 --> 29:35.295
Am I speaking
with Gloria Irish?

29:35.382 --> 29:38.515
Mike!
They're back again!

29:38.602 --> 29:40.256
Just to confirm, you're
the realtor who helped with

29:40.343 --> 29:43.042
the apartment rental for
al-Shehhi and al-Ghamdi?

29:43.129 --> 29:45.566
I had no idea
what they were planning.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.220
Come on in.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.222
But we told the other
FBI agents everything

29:49.309 --> 29:50.789
three weeks ago.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.141
Did you ever
mention your husband to

29:55.228 --> 29:57.578
either al-Shehhi or al-Ghamdi?

29:57.665 --> 29:58.666
I'm sorry,
I don't understand...

29:58.753 --> 30:00.581
I never met them.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.931
Uh, I don't know.

30:03.018 --> 30:06.326
I, I might've mentioned him.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.023
While you were talking,

30:08.110 --> 30:09.546
did you ever mention
where your husband worked?

30:09.633 --> 30:11.984
Could you
tell us what's going on?

30:12.071 --> 30:14.638
Bob Stevens
worked for you at <i>AMI.</i>

30:14.725 --> 30:17.728
Is this about the
anthrax business in the news,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.730
thought they said
he caught it outdoors?

30:19.818 --> 30:22.733
Oh, well, they
may have jumped the gun.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.344
Did you know the
two terrorists had a

30:24.431 --> 30:26.563
subscription to the
<i>National Inquirer?</i>

30:26.650 --> 30:28.652
And the number of photos of
Bin Laden your paper put on

30:28.739 --> 30:31.090
its front page may
have prompted the attack?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.181
You might have
been the target.

30:35.268 --> 30:36.878
Oh my God!

30:36.965 --> 30:39.446
Have you
received any threats recently?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.361
Terrorists love publicity.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.189
They want everyone to know
whenever they're responsible.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.581
No. Nothing.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.670
I'd remember a
threat like that.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.673
Have any
other employees called
out sick this past week?

30:49.760 --> 30:51.240
Let me make a call.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.901
Yeah, Frank.
Hi, it's Mike.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.685
Can you tell
me if any one of...

31:01.772 --> 31:03.165
I just keep
thinking what if I had noticed

31:03.252 --> 31:05.385
something about those men?

31:05.472 --> 31:07.996
Well, none of
us ever wants to see
the worst in people.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.042
Yup. It's still there.

31:10.129 --> 31:13.219
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.614
One guy is out today.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.486
First sick day in seven years.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.140
Ernesto Blanco.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.143
- You Agent Ryker?
- Clemons?

32:08.230 --> 32:09.492
We spoke in June.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.885
CDC Infectious
Diseases, right?

32:10.972 --> 32:13.583
Epidemic Intelligence.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.716
They were supposed
to send you here an hour ago.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.239
We're in
the middle of swabbing
the Stevens's place...

32:17.326 --> 32:18.371
I know, that's
gonna come up clean.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.938
How do you know?

32:20.025 --> 32:21.374
Because we
found a second worker.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.245
This one passed
out on a city bus.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.812
Went to the hospital
a few hours ago,

32:24.899 --> 32:26.466
symptoms point to anthrax.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.294
And since I doubt that
both Bob Stevens and

32:28.381 --> 32:30.949
Ernesto Blanco tracked
anthrax into this building...

32:31.036 --> 32:32.254
The source of
the infection is inside.

32:32.341 --> 32:33.995
We need to find it.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.955
Not just how, but
whoever the hell is behind it.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.827
Remind your team that
everything here is evidence.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.350
Anyone evacuate the staff?

32:41.437 --> 32:42.961
- Not yet.
- Okay.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.353
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.615
No one knows
what's hot in there.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.965
We shouldn't take any chances.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.357
I got a suit for
you around back.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.272
I've had
all three shots.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.013
And every minute that staff
is inside is another minute

32:52.100 --> 32:53.623
that they could be exposed.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.018
Mine's from
Cindy Crawford's stalker.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.498
Yours any better?

32:58.585 --> 33:00.935
Hey, Steph, what's
in your goody-bag?

33:01.022 --> 33:02.415
Oh.

33:04.373 --> 33:07.594
Oh, it's from Jason.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.726
He has this thing
for sending me mix CDs.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.380
He promised me
he'd get me an iPod so

33:11.467 --> 33:12.816
I don't have to lug
this baby around anymore.

33:14.383 --> 33:15.819
May I
have your attention!

33:15.906 --> 33:18.735
My name is
Special Agent Ryker, FBI.

33:18.822 --> 33:21.695
For your safety, I
need everyone to stand and

33:21.782 --> 33:23.871
calmly exit the building.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.916
Leave everything
on your desks.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.223
Do not take
purses, glasses, pens.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.617
Everything stays.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.097
Oh, my God.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.489
Do you
think this is about Bob?

33:33.576 --> 33:34.708
- Probably.
- Oh, man.

33:34.795 --> 33:35.970
Okay. Let's go.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.363
No need to be alarmed.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.973
This is a
precautionary measure.

33:46.328 --> 33:49.157
I got it over here.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.768
Bob Stevens'
mailbox is blazing.

33:51.855 --> 33:55.294
Definitely
looking at a letter or
package as a mode of attack.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.078
You find anything?

33:57.165 --> 33:58.862
No mail
with any powder residue.

33:58.949 --> 34:01.169
But the prelims show that
a ventilation system above

34:01.256 --> 34:02.692
one desk
contaminated with spores.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.085
That's Stevens, yeah?

34:04.172 --> 34:05.347
Uh, no, no,
afraid not.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.480
Belonged to one of his clerks.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.048
What's their name?

34:10.135 --> 34:11.658
Stephanie Dailey.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.022
<i>REPORTER : </i>
In Florida today,

34:28.109 --> 34:30.198
<i>the FBI has been scouring </i>
through the offices of a

34:30.285 --> 34:32.505
<i>company which </i>
publishes tabloid newspapers.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.333
<i>REPORTER 2 : </i>
Investigators are
taking no chances.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.552
<i>Going through </i>
decontamination as they try

34:36.639 --> 34:38.554
<i>to pinpoint the </i>
source of anthrax.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.339
<i>REPORTER 2 : </i>
Hundreds of AMI workers

34:40.426 --> 34:42.689
<i>are being screened </i>
for signs of bacteria.

34:42.776 --> 34:46.823
Yeah, we said
they could invite their
families in to get tested.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.695
Glue yourself to the
health and safety manager,

34:48.782 --> 34:50.697
report back the second
anyone tests positive.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.177
You got it.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.267
I need your
help finding someone.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.920
You and
everyone else in here.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.270
We're understaffed.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.141
We have no idea.

35:00.228 --> 35:02.143
You didn't wanna
run this through a hospital?

35:02.230 --> 35:03.797
If you can find
one that wants to expose

35:03.884 --> 35:05.973
themselves with possible
anthrax contamination,

35:06.060 --> 35:08.106
be my guest.

35:08.193 --> 35:11.326
Could only get a
sign-off on Boca Raton's
most infamous locale.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.852
Do the words "hanging chads"

35:15.939 --> 35:17.811
mean anything to you?

35:17.898 --> 35:19.987
Seriously?

35:20.074 --> 35:22.816
This is the place
they did the re-count?

35:22.903 --> 35:28.038
- Name?
- Stephanie Dailey.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.779
I'm Special Agent
Matthew Ryker.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.913
Can I have a word, in private?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.262
Yeah.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.050
We've been testing
samples at your offices and

35:40.138 --> 35:44.229
we found anthrax
spores at your desk
and the vent above it.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.665
Oh my God.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.014
Why don't
you take a seat?

35:49.408 --> 35:52.019
First of all, it doesn't
mean that you have it, okay?

35:54.326 --> 35:56.415
I just need to know
whether you remember
opening any packages or

35:56.502 --> 35:59.157
letters with
a white powder inside.

35:59.244 --> 36:03.030
Um, we publish
<i>The Sun</i> and <i>The Enquirer.</i>

36:03.117 --> 36:04.988
We always get kooky mail.

36:05.075 --> 36:06.120
Well, this
would've been a week ago,

36:06.207 --> 36:07.774
two at the most.

36:09.515 --> 36:14.041
Um, yeah, okay,
I remember one package.

36:14.128 --> 36:18.524
It was another
proposal to J-Lo and
maybe had a Star of David

36:18.611 --> 36:20.874
in it and some white
stuff like baby powder.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.441
Okay, what did
you do with that package?

36:22.528 --> 36:25.008
- I need to find it.
- It's gone.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.401
Well, even if
it went into the trash,
I have a team of...

36:26.488 --> 36:28.621
No, I mean,
it's gone, gone.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.711
We, we get all
kinds of hate mail and

36:31.798 --> 36:35.410
alien hunters
and too much trash,

36:35.497 --> 36:37.151
so they started to burn it.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.414
<i>AMI,</i> they just
incinerate all their mail.

36:43.723 --> 36:46.856
Is, um, is Bob gonna die?

36:48.771 --> 36:50.208
I heard on the local news
that it could be engineered

36:50.295 --> 36:51.600
to resist penicillin.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.776
None of
us have said that.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.779
But just as a precaution,
we will start you on an

36:56.866 --> 36:58.085
antibiotic called Cipro,

36:58.172 --> 36:59.129
same as Bob.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.392
Cipro.

37:00.479 --> 37:01.915
It's a newer drug,

37:02.002 --> 37:03.003
so if the anthrax
has been weaponized,

37:03.090 --> 37:04.265
this will knock it out.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.746
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.965
I know this is scary.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.706
But I really think
you're gonna be fine.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.841
Thank, thank you.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.289
Hey, you okay, mom?

37:39.779 --> 37:43.957
No, no, no.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.399
<i>BROKAW : </i>
In tragic news,

38:34.486 --> 38:36.314
<i>we've just learned </i>
that Photo Editor,

38:36.401 --> 38:40.013
<i>Robert Stevens has died </i>
from his anthrax exposure,

38:40.100 --> 38:42.885
<i>the victim of what now looks </i>
to be a targeted attack on

38:42.972 --> 38:45.279
<i>the media giant AMI.</i>

38:45.366 --> 38:47.455
<i>A tragic loss of life.</i>

38:47.542 --> 38:49.457
<i>A senseless attack.</i>

38:49.544 --> 38:52.242
Our thoughts are with
the family of Robert Stevens.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.593
Meanwhile,
another <i>AMI</i> employee,

38:54.680 --> 38:58.161
Ernesto Blanco is
in stable condition.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.600
And the biggest question
still looming tonight,

39:01.687 --> 39:04.646
who's behind this
deadly attack and

39:04.733 --> 39:06.431
will they strike again?

39:22.403 --> 39:24.623
That's <i>Nightly News</i>
<i>for this Thursday.</i>

39:24.710 --> 39:27.843
I'm Tom Brokaw and I'll see
you again tomorrow night.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.372
Thanks.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.461
Here you go, boy,
there you go.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.037
Erin? What's wrong?

39:48.124 --> 39:49.909
O'CONNOR: I was doing the
research you asked for anthrax

39:49.996 --> 39:54.914
and I don't think <i>AMI</i>
<i>was the only media attack.</i>

39:55.001 --> 39:57.090
What do you mean?

39:57.177 --> 39:59.397
O'CONNOR: The doctor
thought it was just
a spider bite, but...

40:05.228 --> 40:07.230
<i>COPAK : This is </i>
now a murder investigation!

40:07.317 --> 40:08.841
Domestic terrorism.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.321
CDC, they got no
business getting in our way.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.759
<i>COPAK : </i>
Get them out of there!

40:13.846 --> 40:15.500
We're only gonna
make things worse if we
piss on our territory, sir.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.502
Let's give them a day,
we're working fine down here.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.504
<i>COPAK : </i>
Ry, Ryker, stop!

40:19.591 --> 40:21.723
<i>We all know this didn't </i>
come from someone's pet llama.

40:21.810 --> 40:22.811
<i>You called it!</i>

40:22.898 --> 40:24.596
<i>It's an attack.</i>

40:24.683 --> 40:27.555
If it falls under
Operation Noble Eagle now.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.514
This is Bush's baby and

40:29.601 --> 40:31.211
he'll be watching
this closely.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.561
I need you to
catch who did this.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.520
Bureau needs it, you got it?

40:37.739 --> 40:38.914
Yup.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.186
You
can't lock us out!

40:50.273 --> 40:53.059
I had a team on
the ground before you
clowns even got here!

40:54.539 --> 40:56.018
You're not gonna
get away with this.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.328
Shut out of my
own investigation!

41:01.415 --> 41:02.677
Are you freaking kidding me?

41:02.764 --> 41:04.723
Yeah.
CDC's off the case.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.376
It wasn't my call.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.161
Well, no,
you're just enforcing it.

41:08.248 --> 41:10.946
You know, the samples your
little windbreaker buddies

41:11.033 --> 41:12.513
just collected
were sent to our labs.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.210
I assume you're
gonna want the results.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.777
So you're gonna
hold our samples hostage?

41:17.257 --> 41:22.088
Come on, look. Come here.

41:22.175 --> 41:25.352
We both know that
the CDC doesn't get
into criminal cases, right?

41:27.789 --> 41:30.444
Have you eaten today?

41:30.531 --> 41:32.794
Come on, I know a place.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.319
Come on.

41:42.108 --> 41:44.327
Well, if you ask me, it feels
like we're just doubling down

41:44.414 --> 41:47.200
on the very same mistakes
that led to all this.

41:47.287 --> 41:49.071
We never learn.

41:49.158 --> 41:52.684
All these agencies
jockeying for position.

41:52.771 --> 41:56.601
FBI, CIA, everyone's
so focused on each other.

41:58.690 --> 42:00.779
We let the wolves
slip into the backdoor.

42:03.172 --> 42:06.262
And now everything
is under the microscope.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.352
Press will dig up
all those red flags.

42:09.439 --> 42:10.876
Don't envy you guys.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.094
Well, we
could tell everybody.

42:14.662 --> 42:17.970
How many times we've
stopped the bad guy.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.449
Every day, I mean,

42:19.537 --> 42:22.670
thousands of
lives we keep safe.

42:25.151 --> 42:26.979
Still.

42:31.287 --> 42:32.550
A lot of pressure.

42:37.032 --> 42:40.601
There were these
two guys on one of the planes,

42:40.688 --> 42:41.863
and their son with them,

42:41.950 --> 42:43.299
three years old.

42:46.085 --> 42:49.479
And I can't get this
picture out of my head.

42:49.567 --> 42:54.310
That moment when you realize
what's actually happening that

42:54.397 --> 42:56.443
you wanna keep
your son safe...

42:59.011 --> 43:00.969
but there's nothing you can do.

43:14.896 --> 43:18.291
- You got kids?
- No.

43:18.378 --> 43:21.337
I got a nephew and a niece.

43:21.424 --> 43:22.948
My nephew's already jaded.

43:26.908 --> 43:28.867
I can't blame him.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.564
I just wanna be
someone he can look up to,

43:30.651 --> 43:32.740
not just another useless suit.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.833
Hey, I shouldn't
be telling you this,

43:38.920 --> 43:42.141
but the results came back.

43:44.578 --> 43:47.146
It's Ames.

43:47.233 --> 43:48.582
Ames strain?

43:52.455 --> 43:55.067
That hasn't
appeared in decades.

43:55.154 --> 43:57.330
I didn't think it
existed outside of
high-security research labs.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.027
It doesn't.

46:16.251 --> 46:17.862
Hi, hon.

46:17.949 --> 46:19.733
Just beat the worst of
the rain it looks like.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.169
There's a big storm coming.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.302
Oh, yeah.

46:23.389 --> 46:24.956
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, baby.

46:27.741 --> 46:29.656
Sorry I'm so late.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.266
Everything
okay at the lab?

46:31.353 --> 46:34.052
Yeah, you know,
just more of the same.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.969
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, dad.

46:38.056 --> 46:39.492
You heard
about the anthrax scare?

46:39.579 --> 46:41.711
Oh, that
poor man and his wife.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.148
It's just awful.

46:43.235 --> 46:45.715
I know.
I'm gonna head down.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.021
Oh, okay.
I'll turn off the oven.

46:47.108 --> 46:48.980
It's meatloaf.

46:49.067 --> 46:50.633
Just nuke it for
two minutes when
you're hungry, okay?

46:50.720 --> 46:51.939
Okay. Will do.

48:13.716 --> 48:15.936
.
