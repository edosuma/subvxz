WEBVTT

00:10.944 --> 00:12.446
<i>It's time, it's time.</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:22.456
Next time you wake me,
I throw you in the river.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.093
What do you want,
little owl?

00:25.193 --> 00:27.528
Calian, it's time.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.804
I need answers.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.773
I can't remember.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.911
But I would never hurt Francis.
You know that.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.713
Independence is
about to wake up

00:45.813 --> 00:47.581
and discover that one
of their Founding Fathers

00:47.681 --> 00:49.817
was just killed
by an Apache's arrow.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.687
I need evidence
you didn't do it.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.557
Or they will have a noose
around your neck by sundown.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.826
I saw her.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.428
Your sister?

01:11.139 --> 01:12.540
<i>It's not like your father
to be late.</i>

01:12.640 --> 01:15.543
Perhaps it's also part
of my punishment.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.547
Our trip was not to punish,
but to give you room

01:19.647 --> 01:24.352
to think about your future,
and who you might spend it with.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.654
Mm. <i>Ya veo.</i>

01:26.754 --> 01:28.156
This is about Hoyt.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.823
We care for Hoyt.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.960
He has a good heart,
but we see how he breaks yours.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.163
And I suppose you and <i>papá</i>
have someone already chosen.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.932
No, the choice is yours.
You have options.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.768
Who?

01:40.868 --> 01:43.537
Calian.
I see how you look at him.

01:43.637 --> 01:44.905
<i>- Ay, mamá.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.640
He's helped out at the ranch.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.576
He's earned the respect
of Luis and your father.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.179
He's a good man.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.046
<i>Piénsalo.</i>

01:53.914 --> 01:55.783
Even Otis thought
Liam was running

01:55.883 --> 01:57.451
from something
back in Boston.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.520
I admit he wasn't
entirely forthcoming

01:59.620 --> 02:01.289
about our reasons
for heading west,

02:01.389 --> 02:03.191
but now with the money
in his account...

02:03.191 --> 02:05.559
That's 7,500 more reasons
to keep quiet.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.796
I don't want to think
he was corrupt, but I just--

02:08.896 --> 02:10.464
Seems to be the way with

02:10.564 --> 02:12.333
folks who hop into bed
with the Davidsons, doesn't it?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.834
Hmm.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.007
I'm sorry, Abby.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.310
All the more reason
I'm looking forward

02:22.410 --> 02:24.312
to meeting
with your Pinkerton contact.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.546
Ethan.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.648
He hasn't left already,
has he?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.082
Uh, no, no. He has not.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.785
I, uh... saw him this morning
with my own eyes.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.723
What?

02:43.231 --> 02:46.334
- Luis...
- Hoyt, what happened?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.674
Looks like one of Calian's.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.245
Hoyt, no.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.313
- No, he couldn't have done this.
- No!

03:01.582 --> 03:03.050
<i>¿Papá?</i>

03:03.150 --> 03:04.785
No...

03:11.925 --> 03:14.962
Where the hell is the sheriff?

03:26.974 --> 03:29.142
Sheriff, we need

03:29.277 --> 03:30.378
- to talk about--
- Talk about the murder

03:30.478 --> 03:31.579
of Francis Reyes.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.314
Yes. And the accused.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.383
Gus caught me up.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.018
Calian's arrow
was in a dead man.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.554
I know it seems damning
at first glance,

03:40.654 --> 03:43.090
but I seem to recall
you telling me that Griffin

03:43.190 --> 03:44.725
should've had his day in court.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.159
Why not Calian?

03:46.294 --> 03:48.061
The people out there
don't get their justice,

03:48.161 --> 03:50.364
and fast, they're gonna
start to get violent.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.466
- And with no courthouse--
- Plenty of room downstairs.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.402
I don't have time to find
an impartial jury, Miss Walker.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.137
- This isn't Boston.
- I'm aware.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.973
Nobody is gonna
represent an Apache.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.345
I will.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.314
You will?

04:09.383 --> 04:12.219
Right now, the people
of this town...

04:12.320 --> 04:15.489
they respect you,
they trust you.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.759
But defending someone
who killed a Founder?

04:18.859 --> 04:21.329
They're never gonna look at you
the same way again.

04:22.663 --> 04:26.133
And what if you lose
and he gets the noose?

04:26.233 --> 04:29.136
That's gonna stick with you.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.439
You really want to do this?

04:33.206 --> 04:35.343
Yes.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.345
Best I can do
is run Judge Parker down

04:37.345 --> 04:39.747
from Travis County
for a hearing.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.015
It's faster.
There's no jury.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.584
Looser rules.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.921
Congratulations, Counselor.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.967
Get back!

05:01.469 --> 05:03.437
If the man in my jail
was your kin,

05:03.537 --> 05:05.005
you'd demand
a fair shake, right?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.108
So a judge will hear
the case today.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.210
Voices will be heard.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.079
The accused can say his piece.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.881
And, in the end,
if he is guilty,

05:13.981 --> 05:17.017
I will personally see that
he hangs by the neck until dead.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.302
You can ask it.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.572
Did you kill Francis Reyes?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.308
It's my arrow
in his chest...

05:43.477 --> 05:45.312
...but I don't remember
shooting it.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.015
And you had no other reason
to want to harm him?

05:48.115 --> 05:49.750
No.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.685
He was my friend.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.421
Good. It's...

05:53.421 --> 05:57.090
it's the beginning of
a reasonable doubt defense.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.760
Abby...

05:59.860 --> 06:01.962
- you don't have to--
- Yes, I do.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.531
You saved my life.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.433
You've been here for me
at every turn.

06:05.533 --> 06:09.903
And, if you haven't noticed,
we've become friends, so...

06:11.238 --> 06:13.707
Can you tell me
what you do remember?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.181
I remember Nascha.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.816
Nascha?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.518
What does that mean?

06:25.453 --> 06:27.187
My little sister's name.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.224
It means "owl."

06:32.626 --> 06:35.228
We called her that because
she was so curious.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.966
You speak about her as if she--

06:39.066 --> 06:41.101
She disappeared...

06:41.201 --> 06:43.471
15 years ago.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.739
I'm so sorry, Calian.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.809
She is the reason
I became a tracker.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.313
I thought if I looked
long enough, I'd find her.

06:53.481 --> 06:58.251
And you...
you saw her last night.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.955
Sometimes she appears,

07:02.055 --> 07:04.858
like an echo of the last time
we were together.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.696
I know...

07:08.796 --> 07:11.364
I know she's just a memory,

07:11.499 --> 07:14.568
but I can still feel her
in my heart.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.773
At times, she guides me
to places I need to be.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.345
Abby, Nascha led me to you.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.901
And last night, when I arrived
at the Reyes' ranch,

07:48.001 --> 07:50.638
she appeared to me again,
Nascha, and she led me away.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.344
Are you okay?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.613
Yes.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.284
My tribe. They don't know
what happened last night.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.753
If some in town blame me,

08:05.853 --> 08:07.655
- they will blame them, too--
- I will warn them.

08:09.456 --> 08:13.426
I still can't figure out
why Calian would do it.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.563
I've worked
side by side with him,

08:15.663 --> 08:18.298
mending fences the rustlers cut.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.900
Nothing was off.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.569
These rustlers were shooting
to kill last night.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.971
Maybe Calian was
defending himself--

08:24.071 --> 08:25.238
His eyes were open.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.374
- Whose eyes?
- My father's.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.110
The last thing
he saw was his killer.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.145
<i>No a su familia.</i>

08:32.245 --> 08:33.881
I welcomed Calian in,

08:33.981 --> 08:36.149
and asked <i>papá</i>
to bring him around more.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.852
We are all responsible.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.757
- Hey, Luis.
- Let him go.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.600
You know, maybe Tom Davidson
isn't the devil

08:52.700 --> 08:54.034
that you imagined him to be.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.803
Like hell. How's that?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.871
This man is a pillar of society.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.041
He is dismantling
his entire establishment

09:01.141 --> 09:03.677
just so a non-citizen
can have his day in court.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.012
A non-citizen?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.680
Ever think maybe
we're the interlopers,

09:06.780 --> 09:09.016
- Calian's the real citizen here?
- No.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.718
Ethan, his ancestors
have been on this land

09:10.818 --> 09:12.152
since back when ours
thought the world was flat.

09:12.252 --> 09:16.423
Mm. I have always admired
your righteousness, Kate.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.091
Well, I am always right, so...

09:18.191 --> 09:19.426
Okay, then prove it.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.795
Where is the widow Collins

09:21.895 --> 09:24.031
and all of the damning testimony
about the Davidsons?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.633
Here's the thing.
Unfortunately, she has

09:25.633 --> 09:27.500
been delayed,
somewhat indefinitely.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.638
- Kate, you're wasting my time.
- Well, I don't have to be.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.773
While you're here,
look into Calian's case.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.174
Ethan, I know the man.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.876
Something about this
doesn't add up.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.845
This hearing is a sideshow.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.147
It in no way intersects
with our interests.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.815
You're unbelievable.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.216
Are we detectives or not?

09:43.316 --> 09:44.952
What the hell
am I doing out here?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.855
I get it. A year is
a long time to be undercover.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.190
You make friends,
you make connections.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.325
It's impossible to avoid.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.861
Sheriff.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.729
Have you met my friend Ethan,
by any chance?

09:57.197 --> 10:00.167
- Uh, no.
- Pleasure's all mine, Sheriff.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.936
Pleasure.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.740
Calian mentioned
seeing a vision

10:06.840 --> 10:09.609
of his missing sister
last night.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.012
Have you ever seen him
in that state?

10:14.547 --> 10:17.184
Once. A year ago.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.021
I lost Calian on a scout.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.556
I backtracked,
found him standing

10:23.657 --> 10:25.793
in the middle of the river.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.929
called his name,
but it wasn't until I got

10:29.029 --> 10:31.098
right next to him
that he woke up.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.107
Calian cut you.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.075
It was a reflex.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.546
After the war, I saw men
escape within their own minds

10:46.646 --> 10:48.315
because the truth
of what they had to do

10:48.415 --> 10:50.250
to survive was...

10:50.350 --> 10:51.551
too hard to face.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.655
Some just have a hard time
leaving that place.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.958
Only explanation
I can figure

10:58.058 --> 10:59.426
is that it was
some kind of accident.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.762
That's exactly why we have
to get to the truth.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.330
Agreed.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.335
Clearing Calian comes first.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.738
But as for the truth,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.605
after all of this is sorted,

11:12.740 --> 11:15.108
I'd appreciate some clarity
on what exactly brought

11:15.208 --> 11:18.211
Abigail Walker
to Independence.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.140
As if Independence hasn't found
enough ways to kill a man.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.312
That door's swingin'
pretty good.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.482
- Hey, looky here.
- What's this?

12:03.523 --> 12:04.825
Is there a problem?

12:04.925 --> 12:08.095
A Founding Father's dead,
and one of them did it.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.797
That's right. It's their fault.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.033
I'd advise...
you stand down.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.604
A little too early
to hang the noose

12:17.704 --> 12:18.939
before the trial starts, Sheriff.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.507
Inclined to agree, Gus,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.275
but I'd rather they get
their anger out building gallows

12:22.375 --> 12:24.644
than burning down our office.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.546
You will let us through...

12:26.646 --> 12:28.816
or shoot.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.953
And cause more of the very
bloodshed you claim to detest.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.294
Thanks.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.466
What is it?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.701
<i>Papá's</i> cup.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.306
<i>I brought it to him
when he was trying</i>

13:26.406 --> 13:29.309
<i>to fix that rail,
before I left for Mexico.</i>

13:30.143 --> 13:31.912
I was so mad
that he wouldn't let me

13:32.012 --> 13:34.647
sing at Hagan's that...

13:34.747 --> 13:36.716
I never said goodbye.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.022
He loved to wake up
before the sun.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.127
He was building
our future, but...

13:47.227 --> 13:49.129
- now there might not
ever be one.
- Hey.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.464
That's not gonna happen.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.903
It's gonna take
a lot of work and prayers,

13:55.903 --> 13:57.637
but you, you and Luis,

13:57.737 --> 13:59.539
you're gonna see it through.
I know it.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.177
You could stay.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.813
Help us.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.085
Yeah.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.221
Maybe it's time I do.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.097
It's gonna be okay.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.308
You know, not everyone
throws bricks.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.678
Most people here
actually want a fair trial.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.613
But that...

15:13.713 --> 15:15.415
Might as well be reading
a fantasy novel.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.317
There's nothing in there
that's gonna clear the man.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.120
It was dark,
and there was gunfire nearby.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.489
Perhaps Calian shot
in self-defense,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.157
and didn't see Francis.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.626
Reasonable doubt, Sheriff.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.698
It's not that simple.

15:31.798 --> 15:35.368
Tell me, why did you agree
to pin that star on your chest?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.869
Because right now,
it really doesn't seem

15:37.004 --> 15:38.805
as though you care
about the letter of law

15:38.905 --> 15:40.407
or finding the truth.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.144
I'll admit,
before I became the law,

15:44.244 --> 15:48.081
I never got much
out of following it.

15:49.249 --> 15:53.686
Might work in a marble mausoleum
of a courthouse back east.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.525
People here, on the jagged edge
of the world...

16:00.093 --> 16:01.628
...they just want
to know the man.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.334
Judge is ready.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.770
I thought
you were leaving tomorrow.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.772
Well, you asked me to stay
to meet with Mrs. Collins

16:12.872 --> 16:15.875
and hear all this evidence
that you've been...

16:16.043 --> 16:17.577
so doggedly chasing down,

16:17.677 --> 16:19.846
but, since that
is not forthcoming,

16:19.946 --> 16:22.649
I have more pressing matters
to attend to.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.654
You were right, you know.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.958
I may be losing a little bit
of perspective.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.094
Mm.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.566
Here. Let me do it.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.102
Let me do it.

16:43.903 --> 16:47.240
I will admit, I always did like
when you would take over.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.709
You don't say.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.914
You know, I'd be lying if I said
I didn't miss this.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.085
Meeting undercover.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.188
Sometimes...

17:01.288 --> 17:03.090
under covers.

17:09.262 --> 17:13.300
You know, Katherine,
I was worried I lost you again,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.335
down that same rabbit hole

17:15.435 --> 17:17.370
that got you in trouble
back east.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.905
Well, that's history, isn't it?

17:21.908 --> 17:23.943
Back.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.945
- E?
- Mm-hmm?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.149
What do you think
of Tom Davidson

17:29.249 --> 17:31.784
now that you've met him
in the flesh?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.823
Well, you know. It's hard
to tell from just a handshake,

17:36.923 --> 17:40.327
but he hardly seems like
the cold-blooded killer

17:40.427 --> 17:42.495
that you advertised.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.698
And which handshake was that?
Was that earlier

17:45.798 --> 17:47.567
or was that this morning,
when you met in secret?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.968
And now that I have
your attention,

17:49.136 --> 17:51.538
I really would like
some honest answers.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.778
Thought there'd be more people.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.150
After years of trying to hide,
now you want a parade?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.357
I should've cut you loose
at the ranch.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.692
Let you ride away.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.196
Put both our lives
on the line?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.699
No.

18:20.867 --> 18:24.003
Still,
always thinking of others.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.454
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.856
<i>Djon-deh-zee.</i>

18:50.062 --> 18:52.465
I'm glad Nascha led me to you.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.409
Now, normally,
with the evidence in hand,

19:02.509 --> 19:05.412
and by virtue of the accused
being a non-citizen,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.380
the punishment would have
already been meted out.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.718
But, considering the proximity
between the accused's tribe

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
and the town,
Sheriff Davidson

19:13.420 --> 19:16.456
has called for these proceedings
to sort facts,

19:16.556 --> 19:21.027
settle doubt, and assure peace
no matter the outcome.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.595
I call this hearing to order.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.735
Francis Reyes was already dead
when I arrived.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.937
Yes, with an arrow in his chest.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.273
Have you assessed
how that happened, sir?

19:33.373 --> 19:36.108
Any guess of mine would be
purely speculation,

19:36.243 --> 19:38.811
and not applicable to the fact,
Your Honor.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.413
Fine, but what about motive?

19:40.513 --> 19:43.250
Your town was established
on tribal land.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.018
Francis lobbied for Calian
to be a liaison

19:46.118 --> 19:48.655
between the tribe and the town.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.989
He trusted him.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.258
He knew he would help
keep the peace,

19:51.258 --> 19:52.625
not start a war.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.894
Have you seen this man exhibit

19:54.994 --> 19:57.730
any kind of violence?

20:04.671 --> 20:05.872
Not that I can recall,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.740
Your Honor.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.344
Very well. Next witness.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.714
I was...
tending to a new calf

20:14.814 --> 20:16.483
when I heard my father
call for me.

20:17.284 --> 20:21.187
And then there were
loud voices...

20:21.288 --> 20:23.122
Gunshots.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.157
And I ran.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.861
And that's when I saw...

20:29.862 --> 20:31.698
...him.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.833
Standing over my dead father.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.805
If I had just run
when <i>papá</i> called...

20:38.905 --> 20:41.207
I could have stopped it.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.644
Why did you take him from us?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.957
Okay, I, uh...

20:58.057 --> 20:59.859
I understand
that I've upset you,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.994
but did you have
to shave my mustache?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.563
It's always bothered me.
Why did you lie?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.598
Kate, you know how it works.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.067
We-we compartmentalize. We...

21:08.167 --> 21:09.602
We keep secrets from each other.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.003
- You used to read me in.
- Yeah,

21:11.103 --> 21:12.405
and I was going to,

21:12.505 --> 21:14.206
but you've-you've been
so focused

21:14.341 --> 21:16.142
on the Liam Collins murder,

21:16.242 --> 21:19.479
and now this sham of a hearing
downstairs, that I...

21:20.647 --> 21:23.716
I felt it best
to ease you into the news.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.552
News? What news?

21:25.652 --> 21:29.489
Pinkerton's pulled us off
the government contract.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.157
We work for The Plains Union
Railway now.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.993
I met with Davidson
because he is the sheriff

21:34.093 --> 21:36.363
on a future rail stop,
so he's to be kept abreast

21:36.363 --> 21:38.398
of any and all threats
that might endanger

21:38.498 --> 21:40.433
- the railway's progress.
- Wait. So this whole time

21:40.533 --> 21:43.235
I've been investigating the
corrupt, you've been...

21:43.370 --> 21:44.637
What, you've been
protecting them?

21:44.737 --> 21:45.872
Come on, Kate.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.073
Does he know who I am?

21:47.173 --> 21:49.642
No, he doesn't.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.779
And I suggest you stop
chasing him before that changes.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.046
Is that a threat?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.848
Kate, I am trying to help you.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.017
You've lost your compass again.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.486
This is looking
a lot like Baltimore.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.388
Don't you talk to me about
Baltimore. Don't mention

22:01.488 --> 22:02.722
- Baltimore to me!
- You want to get
somebody else killed?

22:03.690 --> 22:06.793
The powers that be assigned you
to this backwater town to...

22:06.893 --> 22:09.228
get right with the agency.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.565
And I'm not sure
you're doing that here.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.703
Come on, Kate, you're the--
you're the best agent I know.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.305
I need you.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.177
Kate. Kate.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.620
I would like to call
the accused.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.160
What are you so afraid of?

22:41.260 --> 22:42.529
You've already condemned him
in your mind.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.330
What is the harm
in letting him speak?

22:51.604 --> 22:54.040
Well, look at you.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.508
Above it all.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.445
I will have order!

22:58.445 --> 23:02.749
Your Honor, I acknowledge
that the accused has no memory

23:02.849 --> 23:04.617
of the events
surrounding the murder,

23:04.717 --> 23:07.554
and, for some here, that would
be enough reason to convict.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.990
I ask, however,
that we not dwell

23:11.090 --> 23:13.760
on what he cannot remember,

23:13.860 --> 23:15.462
but rather on what he can.

23:18.865 --> 23:24.571
Calian, can you tell me what
you remember from that night,

23:24.671 --> 23:26.573
15 years ago...

23:28.340 --> 23:30.477
...when your sister Nascha
was kidnapped.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.078
Miss Walker, I am trying to

23:32.178 --> 23:33.680
- understand the relevance here.
- Your Honor, I promise,

23:33.780 --> 23:34.914
if you'll indulge me,
I will get to the point.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.990
I know what happened that night

23:44.090 --> 23:46.058
makes you feel alone,

23:46.158 --> 23:48.628
but you're not.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.264
<i>It's time.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:02.575
It was a raid,
in the dark...

24:03.576 --> 24:05.344
<i>They killed half our camp.</i>

24:06.378 --> 24:07.547
<i>Injured so many others.</i>

24:07.647 --> 24:08.881
Calian!

24:13.520 --> 24:15.622
<i>They took her. My sister.</i>

24:19.158 --> 24:21.528
<i>I tried to stop them, but...</i>

24:22.529 --> 24:24.864
Calian, you can stop there.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.236
- It's my fault. I should've--
- Should've done what?

24:30.336 --> 24:31.571
Should've shot
the one who took her.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.673
Even if you had,
there were many attackers.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.842
- Another would've come.
- Then I would have shot again.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.777
And what if they had more men
than you had arrows?

24:37.877 --> 24:40.647
Would you have tracked them
for miles into the night?

24:40.747 --> 24:43.315
No. No.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.785
And why couldn't you?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.888
'Cause I was just a boy.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.389
I was scared.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.824
I think that's enough,
Ms. Walker.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.660
Your Honor, please,
just let me establish...

24:53.760 --> 24:55.728
- The accused may stand down.
- ...everything Calian has giv...

25:01.868 --> 25:04.604
Outside, you've built gallows
to hang me for a crime...

25:06.138 --> 25:09.676
...but none of you have asked me
if I'm guilty or innocent.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.380
So I ask for you:

25:14.480 --> 25:16.583
Did I kill Francis Reyes?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.122
My answer is no.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.958
'Cause he was my friend.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.461
I could never have hurt him.

25:33.265 --> 25:38.370
After Nascha was taken, my tribe
was too injured to search.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.042
I knew she was still alive,
so I came here for help.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.913
I came to you,
but none of you believed me.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.218
And now, years later,
when your children go missing,

25:52.318 --> 25:54.854
you come to me...

25:54.954 --> 25:57.857
'cause you know I won't give up
until I find them.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.495
And yet today,
before I could even ask

26:03.630 --> 26:06.365
that you believe
in my innocence,

26:06.465 --> 26:08.635
you already tied a noose.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.074
Will none of you stand for me?

27:02.254 --> 27:03.923
As I sit here today,

27:04.023 --> 27:06.092
to weigh the goodness
of a man's heart

27:06.192 --> 27:08.961
against the evidence
of his actions,

27:09.061 --> 27:12.699
I am struck
by a story of a man

27:12.699 --> 27:14.867
who has experienced great loss.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.569
Yet he did not fall
into the abyss,

27:17.704 --> 27:21.507
but rather turned his pain
into purpose

27:21.607 --> 27:24.010
to help the people
of Independence.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.318
But, uh...

27:32.418 --> 27:34.854
but the law's clear.

27:35.722 --> 27:40.026
And as much as I would like
to determine reasonable doubt,

27:40.126 --> 27:43.362
the accused cannot
adequately explain

27:43.462 --> 27:48.067
how his own arrow pierced
the chest of the victim.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.536
Which leads me
to the only verdict

27:50.636 --> 27:53.740
I can make by our laws
and customs.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.776
Guilty.

28:07.453 --> 28:12.058
Son, may God have mercy
on your soul.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.162
I'm so sorry.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.875
Did you hear him?

28:28.975 --> 28:30.442
Clawing for compassion

28:30.542 --> 28:32.912
before <i>papá</i> is even
in the ground?

28:34.113 --> 28:35.948
You're showing your tell, Luis.

28:37.984 --> 28:41.053
You want to know
why you're a bad poker player?

28:42.254 --> 28:44.156
'Cause your tell's
always the same

28:44.256 --> 28:47.059
when you got a bad hand
and empty pockets.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.663
You were doing it on the stand.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.399
You're doing it right now.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.868
Why?

28:55.968 --> 28:59.005
You want to talk
about lies and gambling now?

28:59.105 --> 29:00.406
Stop this.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.009
Nothing will erase seeing
your friend Calian

29:03.109 --> 29:05.812
shooting his arrow

you saw Calian shoot him.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.824
Which is it, Luis?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.959
Hmm?

29:21.493 --> 29:24.831
You were arguing with <i>papá</i>
all day.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.498
Why?

29:30.169 --> 29:32.738
He always saw himself
in you, Luis.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.574
No! No, we were not the same!

29:35.674 --> 29:38.044
You know how mad he gets!

29:38.144 --> 29:40.446
He accused me of stealing
our own cattle,

29:40.546 --> 29:43.315
said he couldn't trust me
to run the ranch when he's gone.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.749
The right man is in jail.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.385
And an innocent one didn't hang.

One of those Roman generals
you like to read about?

34:23.495 --> 34:24.896
Abraham Lincoln.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.772
I've been meaning to ask you...

34:35.607 --> 34:38.610
What were you
and my predecessor doing

34:38.710 --> 34:40.479
at the Reyes Ranch last night?

34:41.847 --> 34:45.617
We were following a lead
on their stolen cattle.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.753
Didn't expect it
to be their own son.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.523
I wonder who put him up to it.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.927
Hmm.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.933
Sheriff, you all right?

35:03.202 --> 35:05.171
Right as rain.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.189
Ethan.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.558
I thought you might want this.

35:26.658 --> 35:27.793
Kate, do you have any...

35:27.893 --> 35:29.228
any idea
of what you're about to do?

35:29.328 --> 35:30.796
Do you have any idea
what I've already done,

35:30.896 --> 35:32.598
in the name of that badge?

35:32.698 --> 35:35.066
E, we were supposed
to protect people.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.303
We were supposed to protect
hard-working people

35:37.403 --> 35:38.904
that were building a dream.

35:39.004 --> 35:41.673
Instead, we-we-we have a...
a trail of broken lives

35:41.773 --> 35:43.609
we left behind us.
For what? For a client?

35:43.709 --> 35:46.778
The old man likes you, Kate.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.880
He doesn't take well
to letting go of things.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.016
Lucky that I'm not a thing.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.221
So, what, uh...
what do you want me to tell him?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.889
You tell him
that if the Davidsons

35:57.989 --> 35:59.258
somehow find out who I am,

35:59.358 --> 36:00.592
I will burn you to the ground.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.228
My government contacts,
the press...

36:02.228 --> 36:06.064
I will make sure the world
knows what you've become.

36:07.098 --> 36:10.302
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.738
It's nice here in Purgatory.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.243
It was really good
seeing you, Kate.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.778
Thanks for the shave.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.758
I, uh...

36:32.858 --> 36:35.261
I shouldn't have stayed away

36:35.361 --> 36:36.695
when you needed me.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.831
- I owe you an--
- You helped save my life, Hoyt.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.569

36:43.669 --> 36:44.870
I know he cared for you.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.373
Yeah, well...

36:47.473 --> 36:49.441
after I turned Luis in,

36:49.541 --> 36:52.010
I don't know how Lucia
and her mom are gonna feel.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.446
You have to be there for them.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.684
Yeah.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.422
Hey, that whole
saving your life bit...

37:04.690 --> 37:06.525
Does that mean you owe me now?

37:08.093 --> 37:10.296
I said you helped.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.308
If they learned you lied
on the stand today...

37:22.308 --> 37:24.310
I was just doing
what you would've did for me.

37:26.111 --> 37:28.580
Sometimes I wonder

37:28.680 --> 37:31.383
why I'm protecting the same
people that would hang me

37:31.483 --> 37:32.951
at the first accusation.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.389
Part of me feels
like I should leave with you.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.926
And part of you knows
you should stay.
