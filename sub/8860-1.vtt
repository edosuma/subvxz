00:28.795 --> 00:30.663
Since its
inception in 1951,

00:30.763 --> 00:34.400
the Masters has been
a showcase event.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.236
Competition always is keen among
the huge field of participants,

00:37.336 --> 00:39.272
who bowl in qualifying
play for one

00:39.372 --> 00:42.408
of 63 positions in
the match play final.

00:42.508 --> 00:46.479
The defending champion is
exempt from qualifying.

00:46.579 --> 00:49.115
As usual the event has
attracted bowling's elite,

00:49.215 --> 00:51.150
including Master's champions.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.852
My
grandfather told me

00:52.952 --> 00:54.654
that Earl Anthony
was the greatest

00:54.754 --> 00:57.290
bowler that every lived.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.560
He used to watch videos of
him with my dad and Uncle Sean

01:00.660 --> 01:02.361
when they were kids.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.797
Earl was a left-handed
bowler-- a south paw,

01:04.897 --> 01:08.401
my grandfather said-- who kept
his hair short and his glasses

01:08.501 --> 01:09.469
on.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.938
He was square-- so
square the other bowlers

01:12.038 --> 01:15.007
called him Square Earl.

01:15.108 --> 01:18.144
He won 43 titles in his life.

01:18.244 --> 01:23.282
In 1975, he was the first
bowler to earn over $100,000.

01:23.382 --> 01:26.486
And in '82, he was the first
to make over $1 million

01:26.586 --> 01:28.254
in lifetime earnings.

01:28.354 --> 01:31.491
And in 2000, he was named
Master of the Millennium

01:31.591 --> 01:33.459
by "Bowling Magazine."

01:33.559 --> 01:37.997
On August 14, 2001, he fell
down a flight of stairs

01:38.097 --> 01:40.466
at a friend's house and died.

01:40.566 --> 01:44.771
After everything he'd done,
he hit his head on the floor

01:44.871 --> 01:46.305
and that was it.

01:46.405 --> 01:50.543
The great Earl
Anthony gone forever.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.111
That got me to thinking.

01:52.211 --> 01:54.313
What happens to us when we die?

01:54.413 --> 01:57.049
Are we just gone--
finito, kaput?

01:57.150 --> 01:59.552
Or do we live on forever?

01:59.652 --> 02:03.422
And if we do, where do we go?

02:03.523 --> 02:07.627
Where had the greatest
bowler of all time gone?

02:07.727 --> 02:09.228
Where was Earl Anthony?

03:41.454 --> 03:44.757
Eli, we've been
talking for a while now,

03:44.857 --> 03:46.525
and I want to help.

03:46.626 --> 03:50.263
But maybe you should tell
me the reason you're here.

03:50.363 --> 03:53.099
The reason I'm here-- well,
my family's Presbyterian,

03:53.199 --> 03:54.667
but we don't go to church.

03:54.767 --> 03:58.004
Because honestly it's just not
a very satisfying religion,

03:58.104 --> 04:00.306
so I'm thinking of
becoming Catholic.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.609
And for me the whole idea of
an afterlife is very appealing.

04:03.709 --> 04:06.279
Presbyterians believe
in heaven and hell.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.881
Well, yes, but not purgatory.

04:08.981 --> 04:11.217
I like the idea
that if you mess up,

04:11.317 --> 04:14.287
you go somewhere and do
whatever to make up for it.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.688
And then you go to heaven.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.423
I just kind of want to
know what would constitute

04:17.523 --> 04:19.791
truly evil-- because
for me-- truly evil

04:19.892 --> 04:22.161
is kind of a game changer.

04:22.261 --> 04:25.464
Have you done something
you want to tell me about?

04:25.564 --> 04:26.699
No.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.735
Would you say killing
someone would be truly evil?

04:29.835 --> 04:31.671
Have you killed someone?

04:31.771 --> 04:33.072
No.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.775
But what if someone was
about to kill your mother?

04:35.875 --> 04:38.911
And you had to make a
choice-- kill him or let

04:39.011 --> 04:40.346
him kill your mother?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.148
There's really no
choice, now is there?

04:42.248 --> 04:43.516
You have to kill him.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.985
Now I say that's a
purgatory-heaven situation.

04:46.085 --> 04:46.719
What do you say?

04:53.826 --> 04:56.195
Well, it used to be you
could count on your sports

04:56.295 --> 04:57.430
seasons in this country.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.132
Now you've got fall
baseball, soccer--

05:00.232 --> 05:02.501
which never quits--
and now lacrosse,

05:02.601 --> 05:04.437
squeezing itself
in wherever it can.

05:04.537 --> 05:08.741
I mean, are we even
in America anymore?

05:08.841 --> 05:10.876
Yo know it's an Indian game.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.978
What, lacrosse?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.245
Mm-hmm.

05:13.346 --> 05:17.850
Oh, let me guess--
we stole it from them.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.519
Sometimes I think you take
that whole my grandmother was

05:20.619 --> 05:22.621
an American Indian
thing a little too far.

05:25.257 --> 05:26.892
McAllister Sports?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.761
Oh, hey, Hal.

05:28.861 --> 05:31.530
Sure.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.599
Hey, Hal.

05:33.699 --> 05:34.200
What?

05:38.170 --> 05:39.638
Well, no.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.241
No, I know he's your son-in-law,
Hal, but does he even bowl?

05:45.478 --> 05:45.811
OK.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.713
OK.

05:47.813 --> 05:49.382
Well, how bad is Jesus?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.922
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.358
I'll see you there.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.327
What-- what happened?

06:01.427 --> 06:03.796
Jesus sawed off the tips of
his middle and his index finger

06:03.896 --> 06:07.366
on a job-- on his
bowling hand no less.

06:07.466 --> 06:11.971
He's in a cast for three weeks--
right before the Fiesta Cup.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.172
Thanks, Jesus.

06:13.272 --> 06:14.507
Thanks.

06:14.607 --> 06:15.307
Thank you.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.343
I'm sure he didn't mean to.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.844
Aw, I mean, come on.

06:18.944 --> 06:21.414
Even on his best days Jesus
could never replace Rick.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.283
But I thought, you know, maybe
we might still have a shot,

06:24.383 --> 06:27.253
but now we've got
Hal's son-in law who

06:27.353 --> 06:29.221
bowled a little in high school.

06:29.321 --> 06:31.857
I'm sorry.

06:31.957 --> 06:35.294
No, I-- I-- I just feel
bad for Eli is all.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.362
I got to go.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.131
He likes meeting
me at the alley.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.967
You know, he's great at
keeping stats that kid.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.570
How much of an athlete though.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.073
You know, Sean's
probably at Rick's.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.974
You want to stop by there first?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.911
No, Eli'll be waiting for me.

06:52.011 --> 06:52.778
Hey. wait a minute.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.550
Have a good practice.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.431
Ow.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.337
Where you going, midget?

07:18.437 --> 07:20.039
Wolf, just leave me alone.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.006
I--

07:21.107 --> 07:22.274
Are you going to stop me?

07:22.374 --> 07:24.176
Yeah, like
that's going to happen.

07:24.276 --> 07:25.344
Not.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.912
I already did
your math homework.

07:27.012 --> 07:29.115
And I was thinking maybe you
could write my history report.

07:29.215 --> 07:29.715
What?

07:29.815 --> 07:31.450
Hey!

07:31.550 --> 07:33.552
I told you go to store.

07:33.652 --> 07:35.688
I'm going.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.456
Who's this?

07:37.556 --> 07:40.226
Just a friend from school.

07:40.326 --> 07:43.028
You got a name?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.798
Eli McAllister, sir.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.900
Ain't I seen you
around a bowling alley?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.036
I keep stats for my
grandpa's bowling team.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.738
Dick McAllister's your grandpa?

07:52.838 --> 07:53.906
Yes, sir.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.041
So that means your
dad's Rick McAllister?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.643
Yes, sir.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.678
Now, your dad and grandpa used
to kick our asses in the Fiesta

07:59.778 --> 08:00.980
Cup.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.082
You know I went to high
school with your dad.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.451
I didn't know that.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.853
What the hell are
you still doing here?

08:07.953 --> 08:08.454
Go!

08:14.293 --> 08:17.263
It's a fucked up world, kid.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.398
I'm sorry, sir?

08:19.498 --> 08:22.234
You're dad-- a
decorated war hero

08:22.334 --> 08:23.769
and a hell of a ball
player-- gets sick.

08:23.869 --> 08:28.307
You're freaking uncle
makes more money than God.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.575
You give your dad my best.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.246
You tell your grandpa
we're going to take

08:34.346 --> 08:35.681
the cup of his hands this year.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.044
Hey.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.813
Where's Eli?

09:07.913 --> 09:10.783
He's at the bowling
alley with your dad.

09:10.883 --> 09:15.454
He's keeping stats
for the tournament.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.289
He told me.

09:17.389 --> 09:20.726
Said the cup is as
good as ours already.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.164
Hey.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.265
How we doing?

09:26.365 --> 09:27.333
Hmm?

09:27.433 --> 09:28.767
OK.

09:28.867 --> 09:29.201
Yeah?

09:29.301 --> 09:30.436
Mm-hmm.

09:30.536 --> 09:33.072
Were you able to
get a nap at all?

09:33.172 --> 09:34.673
Mm-mm.

09:34.773 --> 09:36.442
No?

09:36.542 --> 09:38.077
How's your pain?

09:38.177 --> 09:39.044
Not so bad.

09:44.516 --> 09:48.754
Could we just--
he just woke up?

09:48.854 --> 09:50.189
It's good to stay ahead of it.

09:58.831 --> 09:59.131
All right.

10:03.636 --> 10:04.703
Play me something.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.779
I can't believe you had
that thing brought in here.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.114
Music.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.416
You.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.018
One in the same to me.

12:00.519 --> 12:01.587
Hey, Sean.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.459
OK, Mr. Big Shot over here.

12:07.559 --> 12:09.128
OK, everybody calm down.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.529
No, no, no.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.865
Sorry, you're not old
enough. -Neither are you.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.867
Dude-- she's the
same age as I am.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.969
Well, yeah, but you're
driving us all home.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.238
I'll drive.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.239
Lucky.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.206
Glenn, have a beer with me.

12:21.306 --> 12:22.341
I can't.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.809
I have a bio test
in the morning.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.612
I know when we were not wanted.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.614
Give me that.

12:28.714 --> 12:29.982
Oh, come on, man.

12:35.454 --> 12:36.855
What the fuck are
you doing here?

12:36.955 --> 12:37.489
What?

12:37.589 --> 12:38.690
You fucking deaf?

12:38.791 --> 12:39.925
You're always fucking
hanging around

12:40.025 --> 12:42.094
like some fucking baby puppy.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.195
Knock it off, Tim.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.730
No, seriously, this
is a football party.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.598
There's no sophomores
on the football team.

12:46.698 --> 12:48.066
It's Rick's little brother, man.

12:48.167 --> 12:48.934
So?

12:49.034 --> 12:50.269
This turned into
a family picnic?

12:50.369 --> 12:52.004
I could have brung my
little brother along.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.405
Oh, yeah?

12:53.505 --> 12:55.073
Well, unfortunately, Tim, they
only allow one retard per party

12:55.174 --> 12:57.042
and you're already here.

12:58.076 --> 12:58.410
Hey!

12:58.510 --> 12:59.244
What?

12:59.344 --> 13:00.512
You want some, huh?

13:00.612 --> 13:02.981
Come on.

13:04.483 --> 13:07.119
You got something to
say, just say it to me asshole.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.120
Say it to me!

13:44.189 --> 13:44.990
I'm Sean.

13:45.090 --> 13:45.757
Hi.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.125
Come on up, from hospice.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.227
Come on in.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.796
They've, uh-- they've
been expecting you.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.599
Glenn set up a room for you.

13:53.699 --> 13:54.433
Right here.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.844
You're, uh, much better
looking in person.

14:05.944 --> 14:07.646
Huh?

14:07.746 --> 14:10.082
The "GQ" article.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.285
Um, pictures don't
do you justice.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.187
Thanks.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.356
Is Glenn here?

14:17.456 --> 14:18.924
Yeah, she's with your brother.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.324
Come on.

14:26.064 --> 14:29.234
When was last time
you saw your brother?

14:29.334 --> 14:30.536
A while.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.137
Well, his cancer's
fairly advanced

14:32.237 --> 14:33.972
so he's pretty
distressed physically.

14:46.752 --> 14:47.252
Sean.

14:52.724 --> 14:54.059
I'm so glad you came.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.610
Yeah, he's on a morphine drug.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.712
And Anna's giving
him more now, so he

15:13.812 --> 15:16.615
sleeps-- most of the time.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.317
What'd the doctor say?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.319
No more doctors.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.354
It's just he would have
been so much better

15:22.454 --> 15:23.488
if he hadn't done the chemo.

15:26.391 --> 15:27.426
I thought he was--

15:27.526 --> 15:32.230
He wasn't-- I mean, it's
not the doctor's fault.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.700
He as much as said
that he had no hope.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.235
But you know him, he's
always ready to fight.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.041
So how's life across the pond.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.910
God, his friends
brought this in here.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.447
It's so big and it's a mess.

15:53.285 --> 15:53.619
It's good.

15:53.719 --> 15:54.319
Good.

15:54.419 --> 15:55.587
It's good.

15:55.687 --> 15:59.858
So we saw the article in
"GQ" and he was really proud--

15:59.958 --> 16:02.361
and Eli too.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.895
Yeah.

16:03.996 --> 16:06.632
So, have you-- have you-- have
you talked to your father?

16:06.732 --> 16:08.133
No.

16:08.233 --> 16:09.501
Just Evie.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.769
Yeah, Evie's been really great.

16:10.869 --> 16:14.706
She's been helping so much.

16:14.806 --> 16:17.409
How are you?

16:17.509 --> 16:20.545
Really good-- I-- I'm good.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.847
And Eli?

16:21.947 --> 16:24.449
Yeah, he's-- he's as
good as can be, yeah.

16:24.549 --> 16:31.523
I just-- your dad stopped
coming to see Rick.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.091
What?

16:33.191 --> 16:34.059
When?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.661
Yeah, this last week.

16:35.761 --> 16:39.898
You know, you remember he
did that with your mom too.

16:39.998 --> 16:42.034
And Rick doesn't
really say anything.

16:46.405 --> 16:47.606
I'll talk to my dad.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.381
I'm so glad.

16:56.481 --> 16:58.550
He's going to be so
happy to see you.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.598
Thought you said he
played in high school.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.634
Just give him a chance.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.107
At least he hit
a pin this time.

17:22.207 --> 17:22.907
Yeah.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.409
Hey, maybe I could play.

17:24.509 --> 17:26.877
No, rules are rules kiddo.

17:26.978 --> 17:28.714
Are you hungry?

17:28.814 --> 17:29.748
Here.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.784
Go get us a couple of burgers.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.319
We're going to head out now.

17:34.419 --> 17:36.088
We'll come tomorrow
at lunch and see

17:36.188 --> 17:37.522
if we can't make any progress.

17:37.622 --> 17:39.091
Right, Ben?

17:39.191 --> 17:43.028
Some mechanism of the wrist
that I just can't seem to get.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.497
I'm going some of my videos.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.698
Watch Earl Anthony.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.066
He was a southpaw too.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.736
Still, Dick Weber was the best.

17:50.836 --> 17:51.737
In what universe?

17:51.837 --> 17:53.038
Are you kidding?

17:53.138 --> 17:55.273
Weirdo Anthony
couldn't touch Weber.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.209
I'd say Earl's record
speaks for itself.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.244
And I would a nerdy
weirdo over show

17:59.344 --> 18:00.879
boat any day of the week, Hal.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.280
Well, don't worry.

18:02.381 --> 18:06.618
I'm usually able to master
concepts very quickly.

18:06.718 --> 18:07.686
Come on.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.689
A guy like you--
a piece of cake.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.424
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.301
Hey.

18:23.401 --> 18:24.669
How you doing?

18:26.371 --> 18:27.506
Is it bad?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.274
Mm-mm.

18:29.374 --> 18:29.674
OK.

18:34.045 --> 18:35.747
Where you from, Anna?

18:35.847 --> 18:38.150
Lovely Newark, New Jersey.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.318
What brought you here?

18:40.418 --> 18:44.589
I needed a change of pace, to
start travelling a little bit.

18:44.689 --> 18:45.657
I like it here.

18:45.757 --> 18:46.758
People are nice.

18:46.858 --> 18:47.726
There air is clean.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.195
It's quiet.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.965
And it has the most beautiful
sunsets I have ever seen.

18:54.065 --> 19:01.940
My mom used to make
Sean and me sit with her,

19:02.040 --> 19:06.478
wave goodbye to the sun
when we were little.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.547
That's your mom, huh?

19:08.647 --> 19:11.316
She's very beautiful.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.553
Sometimes I hear
her calling me.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.723
How long ago did she pass?

19:23.995 --> 19:25.497
Six years ago.

20:33.598 --> 20:34.432
Uncle Sean.

20:34.532 --> 20:34.833
Hey.

20:34.933 --> 20:35.433
Eli.

20:39.037 --> 20:39.838
Wow.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.740
You've gotten so big.

20:44.342 --> 20:44.676
Dad.

20:44.776 --> 20:45.243
Sean.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.115
When did you get here?

20:50.215 --> 20:51.716
This afternoon.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.552
There was a big car accident on
the road, and it took a while.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.721
Where-- where you
guys coming from?

20:56.821 --> 20:57.989
The bowling alley.

20:58.089 --> 21:00.025
Grandpa's got the
Fiesta Cup on Saturday.

21:00.125 --> 21:00.926
Hal's still playing?

21:01.026 --> 21:01.960
Oh, yeah.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.628
And Hal's son-in-law, Ben.

21:03.728 --> 21:04.629
Oh, really.

21:04.729 --> 21:05.196
How's he?

21:05.297 --> 21:06.464
He's a disaster.

21:06.564 --> 21:07.399
He's not so bad.

21:07.499 --> 21:08.566
Oh, come on.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.903
He's almost as bad a
bowler as your uncle here.

21:12.003 --> 21:13.071
Come on, let's go see dad.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.472
You know, I have to go.

21:14.572 --> 21:16.474
I have to pick up Evie,
then I have to lockup so--

21:16.574 --> 21:17.309
But-- grandpa--

21:17.409 --> 21:19.210
I'll be back later with Evie.

21:19.311 --> 21:20.478
Yeah, listen.

21:20.578 --> 21:22.747
Good job keeping
those stats, kiddo.

21:22.847 --> 21:24.916
It's important.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.518
Well, listen, I got to go.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.652
See you later, OK?

21:34.292 --> 21:37.095
He never stays.

21:37.195 --> 21:41.499
Yeah, I mean--
he's just-- so, Eli,

21:41.599 --> 21:43.168
are you bowling in
the tournament too?

21:43.268 --> 21:44.202
No, I can't.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.004
Kids aren't allowed.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.138
Oh.

21:47.238 --> 21:48.640
You know, my dad,
Hal, and grandpa

21:48.740 --> 21:51.476
won it five years in a row
before my dad went to Iraq.

21:51.576 --> 21:56.414
Yeah, well-- they were always
good bowlers, those three.

21:56.514 --> 22:00.251
Are you as bad as
he said you were?

22:00.352 --> 22:02.787
Actually bowling
was my best sport--

22:02.887 --> 22:03.788
which isn't saying much.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.927
Do you want to go see my dad?

22:09.027 --> 22:10.095
Sure.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.429
Oh, Uncle Sean.

22:11.529 --> 22:13.331
Would you mind
not telling me dad

22:13.431 --> 22:17.135
that Ben's not a good bowler?

22:17.235 --> 22:19.104
Of course.

22:19.204 --> 22:19.838
Come on.

22:19.938 --> 22:20.305
Thanks.

22:23.575 --> 22:27.846
So, you know, this is difficult
for everybody, but

22:27.946 --> 22:32.517
young-- Hey, Dick.

22:32.617 --> 22:33.885
Dan.

22:33.985 --> 22:38.423
I, uh-- just getting some talc.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.025
Getting ready, you know.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.259
You're still in the tournament?

22:41.359 --> 22:42.861
Of course I am.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.463
Great.

22:45.563 --> 22:51.369
Um. [clears throat] Charlie was
talking about maybe stopping by

22:51.469 --> 22:54.906
to see Rick tomorrow.

22:55.006 --> 22:55.507
Great.

22:59.644 --> 23:00.912
There you go.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.714
See you Saturday.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.985
My best to Cora.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.453
Yeah, she's in Phoenix.

23:11.022 --> 23:12.957
What was that look for?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.726
I can't stand
Charlie Cornfelder.

23:14.826 --> 23:19.064
We had to play ball with
that idiot for four years.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.698
Way to go, Evie.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.000
He asked about Rick.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.408
People want to say goodbye.

23:30.508 --> 23:33.211
This is happening,
and you can't--

23:33.311 --> 23:34.846
What, Evie?

23:34.946 --> 23:35.947
What can't I do?

23:41.886 --> 23:43.021
I'm going to go see Rick.

23:43.121 --> 23:44.255
Do you want to come?

23:44.355 --> 23:45.523
I have to finish up here.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.143
Here's mom with John's
neighbor, that crazy old lady

24:05.243 --> 24:05.977
with one eye.

24:06.077 --> 24:06.744
What was her name?

24:06.845 --> 24:08.079
Miss Ramirez?

24:08.179 --> 24:12.117
She-- [laughs] Wait, wait--
She's-- I thought she was

24:12.217 --> 24:13.551
a witch.

24:13.651 --> 24:17.322
She's-- she's like, you guys
are going to go to hell.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.024
Remember she caught
us bombing cars?

24:20.125 --> 24:21.659
What happened?

24:21.759 --> 24:23.027
Yeah.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.799
So, your dad and I, and John
were bombing cars with oranges.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.735
And one of the car swerved
and clipped her fence.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.403
So we were trying
to run and get away,

24:32.504 --> 24:34.639
and Miss Ramirez
comes out and sees us.

24:34.739 --> 24:35.473
Us?

24:35.573 --> 24:37.075
You were the only one she saw.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.711
You ran away and left me.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.445
Yeah.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.680
What happened?

24:42.780 --> 24:44.482
Your dad and John
were faster than me,

24:44.582 --> 24:47.619
so I had to run up and
climb a tree to get away.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.589
And I stayed in the tree
until dad came to get us.

24:51.689 --> 24:53.725
What did grandpa do?

24:53.825 --> 24:54.626
Yelled.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.494
A lot.

24:56.594 --> 24:58.596
I got a whooping.

24:58.696 --> 24:59.831
Did you?

24:59.931 --> 25:01.199
No.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.834
Your dad took the fall.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.435
Said it was his idea.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.207
Yeah.

25:09.307 --> 25:11.176
Was it?

25:11.276 --> 25:11.776
Probably.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.917
Hi, looks cozy in here.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.351
I've Evie.

25:20.451 --> 25:24.189
Hey, um, it's nice to
finally meet you in person.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.324
Nice to meet you.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.860
Hello, sweetheart.

25:28.960 --> 25:29.661
Hey, guys.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.229
I'm sorry to intrude here.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.997
I just want to get
this guy something

25:33.097 --> 25:35.733
to get him through the night.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.535
Glenn, you can give
him one of these pills

25:37.635 --> 25:39.370
if he wakes up in pain, OK?

25:39.470 --> 25:41.406
Can we just give
him a lower dose?

25:47.412 --> 25:49.247
I mean, it's just been
so long since we've all

25:49.347 --> 25:52.083
been together like this.

25:52.183 --> 25:53.918
It doesn't work like that.

25:54.018 --> 25:57.255
Actually it's way
past someone's bedtime.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.756
I don't want to go to bed.

25:58.856 --> 26:00.325
Come on, go with
Evie, sweetheart.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.626
It's a school night.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.127
I don't want to go to school.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.562
We've talked about this before.

26:07.966 --> 26:08.833
Come on.

26:08.933 --> 26:11.135
I'll tell you a
story-- a short one.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.171
Your stories are
never short, Evie.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.977
I love you, kiddo.

26:19.077 --> 26:19.978
I love you, too.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.352
Will you come tuck me in?

26:27.452 --> 26:28.553
Yes, in a few minutes.

26:32.023 --> 26:32.523
Yup.

26:36.427 --> 26:37.929
Goodnight, Uncle Sean.

26:38.029 --> 26:38.529
Goodnight.

27:01.819 --> 27:05.923
Long ago, there
were two sisters.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.626
Blue Dawn and Dancing
Wind, her younger sister.

27:11.696 --> 27:14.065
One day, their mother told
them to get their baskets

27:14.165 --> 27:18.036
and go fill like with pinions
for the coming winter.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.539
She warned them, come
home before dark,

27:21.639 --> 27:24.309
and do not cross the river.

27:24.409 --> 27:27.912
Well, they couldn't find that
many pinions near the puebla.

27:28.012 --> 27:32.216
So they wandered further
until they came to the river.

27:32.317 --> 27:37.755
On the other side of the river,
they saw trees full of pinions,

27:37.855 --> 27:39.957
and Dancing Wind said
their mother would never

27:40.058 --> 27:44.429
find out if they crossed the
river and filled their baskets.

27:44.529 --> 27:47.165
Blue Dawn tried to
resist but she couldn't.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.735
So they walked down the river
till they found some rocks

27:50.835 --> 27:52.870
where they could cross.

27:52.970 --> 27:55.940
Then they started picking as
many pinions as they could.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.277
Soon their baskets
were fulled of pinions.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.845
And they decided to go home.

28:00.945 --> 28:05.616
On their way back, the sun began
to fade behind the mountain.

28:05.717 --> 28:09.754
And it became very, very dark.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.990
They couldn't find the
rocks to cross the river.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.360
And they began to cry.

28:15.460 --> 28:20.164
Raven heard their cries and
he flew down beside them.

28:20.264 --> 28:23.434
He told them he would carry
them across the river.

28:23.534 --> 28:28.940
But in exchange, he asked for
one of the baskets of pinions.

28:29.040 --> 28:34.612
Then Raven grabbed Blue Dawn,
and flew her across the river.

28:37.248 --> 28:40.785
He returned to Dancing Wind.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.255
He picked her up and
began to cross the river.

28:44.355 --> 28:50.027
But high in the sky above
the river, he stopped.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.629
And he said.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.164
Why don't you give
me that basket,

28:53.264 --> 28:56.234
I'll carry it in my beak.

28:56.334 --> 28:58.903
The little girl refused.

28:59.003 --> 29:03.040
And Raven became so
mad, he let go of her.

29:03.141 --> 29:09.847
And she fell, far, far, far down
into the land of the night sky,

29:09.947 --> 29:12.817
where true to her name
she danced along the wind

29:12.917 --> 29:16.888
until she found a star
she could grab a hold of.

29:16.988 --> 29:20.358
Far down below, she heard
her sister calling to her,

29:20.458 --> 29:23.127
come back, come back.

29:23.227 --> 29:25.863
And she began to sob.

29:25.963 --> 29:28.800
The star asked her,
why are you crying?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.868
And she told him
what had happened,

29:30.968 --> 29:32.870
and how much she
missed her family

29:32.970 --> 29:36.107
and how she wished she had
listened to her mother.

29:36.207 --> 29:40.611
The star took pity on her, and
he flew her back down to earth,

29:40.711 --> 29:43.314
and landed her right
beside her sister.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.753
And now it's time
to go to sleep.

29:48.853 --> 29:52.089
Tell me the rest, Evie.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.257
Tell me about the star.

29:56.961 --> 30:03.668
When Dancing Wing went into
the land of the night sky.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.838
She went where souls
go when they die.

30:06.938 --> 30:10.475
And your grandmother told you.

30:10.575 --> 30:14.779
My grandmother told me that
when you see a falling star,

30:14.879 --> 30:18.950
it's a soul coming back to
earth, getting a second chance.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.997
Do you think my dad
will get a second chance?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.338
I don't know, sweetheart.

31:26.617 --> 31:28.886
So then my guy
evolved to a Charizard

31:28.986 --> 31:30.655
which has like 250 HP.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.456
He's-- he's like a--
he's a fire type.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.325
He's a great, um, great Pokemon.

31:34.425 --> 31:38.729
Now we're off on the world of
Pokemon I know nothing about.

31:38.829 --> 31:41.332
You better get going.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.301
Uh, Evie's not here.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.068
She's not?

31:46.737 --> 31:47.872
I'll stay with Rick.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.440
You-- you go ahead.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.008
No, Evie takes him.

31:54.946 --> 31:57.448
You go to school that
we went to, right?

31:57.548 --> 31:58.683
Yeah.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.485
Well, I think I know
how to get there.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.887
Go get your stuff.

32:05.756 --> 32:08.259
I love you.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.561
Eli.

32:10.661 --> 32:13.531
I'll be here when
you get back, OK?

32:13.631 --> 32:15.232
We'll play Pokemon.

32:15.333 --> 32:15.733
OK.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.201
Love you.

32:17.301 --> 32:18.169
Love you, mom.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.971
Bye.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.505
I'll be back.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.414
So, you like school?

32:30.514 --> 32:33.451
Sixth graders are assholes.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.353
Did you like school?

32:35.453 --> 32:36.320
No.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.789
Too many assholes.

32:38.889 --> 32:40.358
How come you never
came to see us?

32:43.661 --> 32:44.795
I came to see you.

32:44.895 --> 32:49.667
Six years ago,
when grandma died.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.802
I was five.

32:51.902 --> 33:00.444
Uh, my business took
off and-- I don't know.

33:00.544 --> 33:04.281
Mom told Evie you didn't
come because of grandpa.

33:04.382 --> 33:05.082
Oh, yeah?

33:08.486 --> 33:09.920
Do you believe in hell?

33:13.691 --> 33:14.959
Uh, no.

33:17.395 --> 33:21.098
But then again I don't really
believe in the afterlife.

33:21.198 --> 33:22.733
Or God.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.535
Why not?

33:24.635 --> 33:27.738
I don't see any
evidence for it.

33:27.838 --> 33:32.143
Energy is neither created nor
destroyed, merely transformed.

33:32.243 --> 33:34.478
First law of thermodynamics.

33:34.578 --> 33:36.080
Meaning?

33:36.180 --> 33:39.650
Meaning that if you think that
humans are energy, like I do,

33:39.750 --> 33:41.852
they transform at death.

33:41.952 --> 33:43.254
They don't just disappear.

33:48.893 --> 33:52.063
Do you like designing
women's clothes?

33:52.163 --> 33:54.665
I design for men too.

33:54.765 --> 33:56.600
Do you have to sew?

33:56.701 --> 33:59.570
No.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.771
I just come up with the ideas.

34:00.871 --> 34:02.840
Other people sew.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.876
Mom hasn't changed
clothes in like a week.

34:05.976 --> 34:08.045
She doesn't play piano anymore.

34:08.145 --> 34:10.214
She used to play
for me before bed.

34:14.885 --> 34:16.120
Good morning, guys.

34:19.356 --> 34:22.460
How did we do through
the night, huh?

34:22.560 --> 34:23.793
He's OK.

34:23.893 --> 34:25.295
Yeah, you didn't have to
give him too many pills?

34:25.396 --> 34:26.464
None.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.431
It-- he was OK.

34:31.135 --> 34:33.036
I'm going to give
you something now.

34:39.176 --> 34:42.480
Glenn, you know
where the morphine is?

34:42.580 --> 34:46.083
What-- no-- you were the last--
you were the last one to give

34:46.183 --> 34:47.318
him the injection, right?

34:49.820 --> 34:52.188
I don't-- some-- it
was on the table.

35:02.967 --> 35:03.601
Uh, Eli.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.974
Your mom is going
through a tough time.

35:13.210 --> 35:16.313
If you need to talk--

35:16.413 --> 35:18.916
Yeah, I'm-- uh, I--
I'm late for school.

35:19.016 --> 35:20.451
I-- I should go.

35:28.325 --> 35:29.226
Eli!

35:29.326 --> 35:30.094
Hey, Eli!

35:32.396 --> 35:34.799
I-- I'll pick you
up from school.

35:34.899 --> 35:35.533
Oh, no.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.600
That's okay.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.836
Well, no-- I-- I'd like to.

35:38.936 --> 35:39.703
Two o'clock?

35:42.640 --> 35:43.140
Three!

35:46.377 --> 35:47.745
What's going on, buddy?

35:47.845 --> 35:50.181
Yeah, what's up, bro?

35:50.281 --> 35:51.115
Yeah.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.149
We're going to
get pumped today--

36:14.738 --> 36:15.739
Sean?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.842
Sean McAllister?

36:17.942 --> 36:19.743
Oh, my God, it is you.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.213
God, you're still gorgeous.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.715
Thank you, uh-- Nan!

36:24.815 --> 36:25.816
Nan, come over here.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.718
Oh my God, Sean.

36:27.818 --> 36:30.588
I just bought some
of your pants.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
That's crazy.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.825
Oh my God, you don't
remember me, do you?

36:34.925 --> 36:37.561
We were cheerleaders.

36:37.661 --> 36:38.395
Ready?

36:38.495 --> 36:39.663
OK.

36:39.763 --> 36:41.165
You can do it, that's OK.

36:41.265 --> 36:42.766
You can beat 'em anyway.

36:42.867 --> 36:46.070
Of course, yes, yes.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.372
That's right.

36:48.472 --> 36:51.275
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about Rick.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.445
I mean he survives Iraq
and now this happens.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.348
Yeah, um, Mike's going
to go see him later.

36:57.448 --> 36:58.949
Shhh.

36:59.049 --> 37:00.951
You know, I got to grab this.

37:01.051 --> 37:01.752
Oh, sure.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.187
Sean, this is Ana.

37:03.287 --> 37:05.456
I was wondering if you
could swing by the pharmacy

37:05.556 --> 37:08.826
and pick up your
brother's prescription.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.261
I got to-- I got to get going--

37:10.361 --> 37:10.761
Oh.

37:10.861 --> 37:11.795
Oh, OK.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.396
Bye.

37:15.866 --> 37:16.367
Bye.

37:20.437 --> 37:21.338
See ya.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.577
God, he's gorgeous.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.179
And uber successful.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.014
He's gay, right?

37:30.114 --> 37:31.815
Yeah, I think so.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.450
Bummer.

37:33.550 --> 37:36.353
So remember,
nocturnal emissions

37:36.453 --> 37:39.390
or wet dreams as
they are often called

37:39.490 --> 37:45.496
are a healthy, normal part
of a maturing boy's life.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.564
Any questions?

38:07.651 --> 38:11.588
Nocturnal emission,
where's my history paper?

38:11.689 --> 38:13.290
I-- I didn't have time.

38:13.390 --> 38:15.359
Do you want to die?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.061
Leave him alone, Wolf.

38:17.161 --> 38:19.196
Who's going to
stop me, four eyes?

38:19.296 --> 38:22.800
We have an arrangement,
don't we, Eli?

38:22.900 --> 38:25.502
Don't we?

38:25.602 --> 38:27.438
No.

38:27.538 --> 38:28.105
No, Wolf.

38:28.205 --> 38:30.407
I don't think we do.

38:30.507 --> 38:34.311
I think I'm just staving off the
inevitable, that at some point,

38:34.411 --> 38:36.246
you're going to cream me.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.615
But you know what, Wolf?

38:38.716 --> 38:42.686
You're going to
fail at everything.

38:42.786 --> 38:46.557
And not because you're
stupid, but because you're not

38:46.657 --> 38:48.726
stupid enough.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.896
If you were more stupid, you'd
be nicer, because being stupid

38:52.997 --> 38:54.798
wouldn't bother you.

38:54.898 --> 38:59.536
But you're smart enough
to know you're stupid,

38:59.636 --> 39:05.409
which makes you mad and
scared, which makes you mean.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.778
Anyway you'd look at
it, you're screwed.

39:11.048 --> 39:14.151
Our arrangement is over.

39:14.251 --> 39:14.985
Hey, you!

39:15.085 --> 39:15.819
You.

39:15.919 --> 39:16.887
Go to the office!

39:16.987 --> 39:18.956
You're dead.

39:19.056 --> 39:19.990
Everybody go to class.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.893
There's nothing to see here.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.928
What happened?

39:25.029 --> 39:26.530
Nothing.

39:26.630 --> 39:30.467
Eli, I know your family's gone
through a rough time right now.

39:30.567 --> 39:33.737
Would you like to go home?

39:33.837 --> 39:34.838
No.

39:34.938 --> 39:37.408
My mom thinks it's best
if I come to school.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.376
Is there anything
I can do for you?

39:39.476 --> 39:40.878
I'd just like to go to class.

40:17.848 --> 40:20.284
Hey.

40:20.384 --> 40:22.486
Thank you so much for
taking Eli to school.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.821
My alarm didn't go off.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.322
No problem.

40:25.422 --> 40:27.224
I was just picking up Rick's
medication down the block

40:27.324 --> 40:28.759
so I thought I'd stop in.

40:28.859 --> 40:29.259
Great.

40:29.359 --> 40:30.160
Thank you.

40:30.260 --> 40:30.761
I'll go get your dad.

40:30.861 --> 40:31.428
No.

40:31.528 --> 40:33.664
Uh-- I can find it.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.032
Of course you can.

40:35.132 --> 40:35.632
Sure.

40:48.812 --> 40:49.313
Dad?

41:09.933 --> 41:12.035
You tell me what happened.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.837
Don't you lie to me.

41:15.105 --> 41:15.906
Dad, please.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.441
What did that coach see?

41:17.541 --> 41:21.178
What do you think he's
just making this up?

41:21.278 --> 41:22.746
Who was with you, Sean?

41:22.846 --> 41:25.115
No one.

41:25.215 --> 41:26.583
God almighty.

41:26.683 --> 41:29.686
What you do reflects
on our family.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.793
I'm not going to tell your
mother and don't you either.

41:36.894 --> 41:39.329
Don't you tell
anyone, you hear me?

41:46.370 --> 41:48.972
Well, this is a surprise.

41:49.072 --> 41:52.276
Uh-- I was just picking
up Rick's medication.

41:52.376 --> 41:55.946
I thought I'd stop by.

41:56.046 --> 41:58.482
John got that scholarship to
Northwestern and the brother

41:58.582 --> 42:01.118
got into the Naval
Academy after that game.

42:01.218 --> 42:02.052
I remember.

42:04.254 --> 42:05.622
You know John's
thinking about running

42:05.722 --> 42:08.292
for mayor of Los Angeles.

42:08.392 --> 42:09.459
I didn't know that.

42:12.629 --> 42:16.166
So, how's England?

42:16.266 --> 42:18.168
It's good.

42:18.268 --> 42:20.504
Good.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.706
I have to unload
some golf balls.

42:22.806 --> 42:23.373
I'll help you.

42:26.376 --> 42:28.011
I'm going to go take
Glenn some lunch.

42:28.111 --> 42:29.079
You guys OK?

42:29.179 --> 42:30.147
Nah, we're fine.

42:30.247 --> 42:30.747
OK.

42:30.847 --> 42:31.815
OK

42:31.915 --> 42:34.084
Would you mind
bringing this to Ana?

42:34.184 --> 42:35.285
Of course.

42:35.385 --> 42:36.753
I'll see you after
bowling practice.

42:43.493 --> 42:45.128
Evie seems nice.

42:45.229 --> 42:45.729
Yeah.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.236
The store hasn't
changed at all.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.004
If it ain't broke, why fix it?

42:57.908 --> 42:58.408
Dad.

43:00.978 --> 43:02.412
You got to see Rick.

43:02.512 --> 43:04.248
Glenn says you haven't
been there in a week

43:04.348 --> 43:08.685
and you just got to go.

43:08.785 --> 43:11.421
You know, that's
rich-- you telling me

43:11.521 --> 43:13.090
I need to go see your brother.

43:13.190 --> 43:15.559
Let me ask you something,
Sean-- where the hell have you

43:15.659 --> 43:17.694
been for the last six years?

43:17.794 --> 43:20.964
Or for that matter, the
16 years before that?

43:21.064 --> 43:22.833
I don't think there's
much time, Dad.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.067
Oh, really?

43:24.167 --> 43:25.602
You don't?

43:25.702 --> 43:27.237
You know, I don't know what
I'd do without you and Evie

43:27.337 --> 43:29.673
breathing down my goddamn neck.

43:29.773 --> 43:32.542
I was here when your
brother got the diagnosis.

43:32.643 --> 43:35.712
And I have been here every
day since, helping his son--

43:35.812 --> 43:38.315
your nephew-- who you have
seen, what, maybe three times

43:38.415 --> 43:39.216
his entire life?

43:39.316 --> 43:39.916
It's not about me, Dad.

43:40.017 --> 43:40.550
It's not?

43:40.651 --> 43:41.818
It's not about me.

43:41.918 --> 43:43.420
You did the same thing
when mom got sick.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.156
Don't you dare bring
up your mother to me.

43:46.256 --> 43:48.659
I held your mother's hand as
she drew her dying breath.

43:48.759 --> 43:49.826
That's because Hal made you.

43:49.926 --> 43:53.130
You would barely
go near the room.

43:53.230 --> 43:55.699
You broke her heart, Sean.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.934
You never even came to see her.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.270
You never came back,
after all she did for you.

44:00.370 --> 44:03.840
I never came back because
you didn't want me to, Dad.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.042
Come on.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.777
Why don't you fucking tell
the truth for a change?

44:06.877 --> 44:08.745
You could barely look
at me after that night.

44:08.845 --> 44:10.981
And the last two years,
I was here, I felt like--

44:11.081 --> 44:12.282
The last two years?

44:12.382 --> 44:14.484
Dear God, Sean, I knew what
you were long before that.

44:20.257 --> 44:21.925
Go see, Rick, OK?

44:22.025 --> 44:22.726
Go see your son.

44:38.375 --> 44:41.712
What you do reflects
on our family.

45:16.313 --> 45:17.214
Hello?

45:17.314 --> 45:18.215
Hey.

45:18.315 --> 45:18.815
You

45:18.915 --> 45:19.783
OK?

45:19.883 --> 45:22.185
No.

45:22.285 --> 45:23.820
Your brother?

45:23.920 --> 45:25.455
Ah, no.

45:25.555 --> 45:26.356
No.

45:26.456 --> 45:28.925
It's, uh-- I don't know.

45:31.595 --> 45:32.562
Sean, what's wrong?

45:35.365 --> 45:36.566
Yeah, it's so complicated.

45:39.369 --> 45:40.804
Yes, it is.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.240
It shouldn't have to be.

45:43.340 --> 45:44.241
Listen, Sean.

45:44.341 --> 45:46.042
I can't do this right now.

45:46.143 --> 45:46.443
Do what?

45:46.543 --> 45:47.043
This.

45:50.547 --> 45:54.084
I know that you're in pain,
and-- We can't talk about it.

45:54.184 --> 45:56.553
I can't be there with you
while you're going through it.

45:56.653 --> 45:58.121
So what exactly
am I meant to do?

46:04.961 --> 46:13.737
I'm sorry that was--

46:13.837 --> 46:18.308
Um-- I-- I-- I've go to go.

46:18.408 --> 46:19.910
Yeah.

46:20.010 --> 46:21.311
OK.

46:21.411 --> 46:21.912
Bye.

46:22.012 --> 46:22.312
Bye.

46:43.366 --> 46:45.569
Glenn.

46:45.669 --> 46:46.169
John.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.141
Hey, sweetie.

46:51.241 --> 46:53.910
I'm so glad you came.

46:54.010 --> 46:54.478
Oh, Rick.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.446
Look who's here.

46:56.546 --> 46:57.714
Oh.

46:57.814 --> 46:58.348
The morphine.

47:03.253 --> 47:07.290
So-- Are Mercedes and
the girls with you.

47:07.390 --> 47:08.592
Yeah.

47:08.692 --> 47:10.660
Yeah, they're at my
mom's getting settled.

47:10.760 --> 47:11.628
Oh, here.

47:11.728 --> 47:13.196
Let me show you.

47:16.233 --> 47:17.133
Oh, wow.

47:17.234 --> 47:19.302
They are gorgeous
like their mother.

47:19.402 --> 47:20.704
And Manny?

47:20.804 --> 47:21.705
Oh, no, no, no.

47:21.805 --> 47:23.440
We don't call him Manny now.

47:23.540 --> 47:25.075
No, it's Manuel.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.511
I still can't
believe you had him

47:27.611 --> 47:28.712
your freshman year at college.

47:28.812 --> 47:30.280
Yeah, yeah.

47:30.380 --> 47:34.150
Well, when we went all the way,
we really want all the way.

47:36.253 --> 47:37.153
You're stupid.

47:37.254 --> 47:37.721
There.

47:37.821 --> 47:40.090
There you go.

47:40.190 --> 47:41.558
Hey, how's Eli?

47:41.658 --> 47:43.093
Oh, he's holding up.

47:43.193 --> 47:51.535
He's, um-- This is from when
they went camping in August.

47:51.635 --> 47:52.969
He looks just like Rick.

47:53.069 --> 47:57.474
I think he looks just
like Sean at that age.

47:57.574 --> 47:59.409
Yeah, I guess he does.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.478
Hey, how's Sean?

48:01.578 --> 48:02.746
Is he here?

48:02.846 --> 48:03.747
Yeah, yeah.

48:03.847 --> 48:05.282
He's at the store with Dick.

48:05.382 --> 48:10.754
You know, I hope they're getting
along, you know.

48:11.488 --> 48:12.556
Oh, I got to pee.

48:12.656 --> 48:13.523
Oh, go.

48:13.623 --> 48:14.124
Go.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.110
Oh, shit.

48:34.210 --> 48:34.778
Goddamn it.

48:38.315 --> 48:38.615
Sean?

48:38.715 --> 48:40.984
Kim?

48:41.084 --> 48:41.751
Hi.

48:41.851 --> 48:43.286
Oh my gosh.

48:43.386 --> 48:45.922
You look gorgeous as ever.

48:46.022 --> 48:48.491
And you haven't changed a bit.

48:48.592 --> 48:49.759
Oh, please.

48:49.859 --> 48:51.528
I saw you on the cover
of some magazine.

48:51.628 --> 48:53.196
You've made it to the big time.

48:53.296 --> 48:54.464
Uh, yeah.

48:54.564 --> 48:58.001
Well, uh-- and you-- last
I heard, you're a doctor.

48:58.101 --> 48:58.635
Oh.

48:58.735 --> 48:59.402
Yeah, technically.

48:59.502 --> 49:00.937
I've got my MD.

49:01.037 --> 49:04.374
And I got my Ph.D. Genetics.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.209
This is my business now.

49:06.309 --> 49:08.979
According to Kim, Tai Chi for
the Spiritually Challenged.

49:09.079 --> 49:10.347
Girls, got to make a living.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.083
From cloning to Tai
Chi-- that's quite a jump.

49:13.183 --> 49:13.717
Ah, yeah.

49:13.817 --> 49:16.953
It's a long story.

49:17.053 --> 49:18.021
I have some time.

49:21.124 --> 49:22.325
You want to give me a hand?

49:22.425 --> 49:24.728
Sure.

49:24.828 --> 49:25.328
So.

49:58.595 --> 49:59.629
You want to hear my theory?

49:59.729 --> 50:01.064
Shoot.

50:01.164 --> 50:02.966
I've decided that it's only
through our relationship

50:03.066 --> 50:06.236
with others that we can
truly understand ourselves.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.971
It's very new agey
for a scientist.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.674
Sean, I've been
surrounded by Petri dishes

50:10.774 --> 50:12.208
for the last 20 years.

50:12.308 --> 50:15.345
You're the best date I've had,
and that was 24 years ago.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.952
Well, you, uh--
you want to dance?

50:23.053 --> 50:25.789
I'd be lying if I said yes.

50:25.889 --> 50:28.324
But since it is a dance-- OK.

50:31.161 --> 50:33.963
I can't believe you
invited me and not

50:34.064 --> 50:36.599
one of thousands of girls
that have a crush on you.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.302
Well, I had to pick between
someone who couldn't dance,

50:39.402 --> 50:41.638
and someone who couldn't
string a sentence together.

50:44.007 --> 50:44.874
Hey, little brother.

50:44.974 --> 50:46.543
Look at John.

50:46.643 --> 50:47.544
Hey!

50:47.644 --> 50:49.079
Let Mercedes breathe, John.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.182
Ow.

50:52.282 --> 50:53.950
Uh, sorry.

50:54.050 --> 50:55.118
He's killing me.

51:16.172 --> 51:18.408
Go ahead and laugh but my
little theory has greatly

51:18.508 --> 51:19.442
improved my life.

51:19.542 --> 51:21.010
I mean, I've done
all kinds of things

51:21.111 --> 51:23.413
that I wouldn't have
done with people.

51:23.513 --> 51:24.481
Like Tai Chi.

51:24.581 --> 51:25.682
Like Tai Chi.

51:25.782 --> 51:26.750
I'm taking salsa.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.251
I'm online dating.

51:28.351 --> 51:30.887
I'd venture to say you're
a tall order for match.com.

51:30.987 --> 51:32.422
Sky diving.

51:32.522 --> 51:33.556
Out of planes?

51:33.656 --> 51:35.125
Yes, exactly.

51:35.225 --> 51:37.961
After you get past the initial
terror, when you're falling,

51:38.061 --> 51:42.332
it's the most peace
I've ever felt. OK.

51:42.432 --> 51:43.900
Enough about me.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.803
How's your family?

51:46.903 --> 51:48.671
It's funny you should
ask about my family.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.940
I think that's my nephew.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.709
He's supposed to be
in school right now.

51:52.809 --> 51:53.309
I better--

51:53.409 --> 51:56.012
Oh.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.615
I promise, next time
we talk about you.

51:58.715 --> 52:00.717
You are a great girl.

52:00.817 --> 52:02.085
Always have been.

52:36.753 --> 52:38.054
Excuse me.

52:38.154 --> 52:40.190
Well, the matinee actually
started 20 minutes ago.

52:40.290 --> 52:41.457
No.

52:41.558 --> 52:43.293
I'm actually looking for a
little boy, 11 years old,

52:43.393 --> 52:45.428
dark hair, red hoodie, backback.

52:45.528 --> 52:47.363
Eli.

52:47.463 --> 52:47.831
Yes.

52:47.931 --> 52:48.731
Eli.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.967
Uh-- He's my nephew.

52:51.067 --> 52:52.535
Oh, well.

52:52.635 --> 52:56.206
He had an appointment with their
spiritual leader, Guru Sai.

52:56.306 --> 53:00.610
It was originally for later
today but he moved it up.

53:00.710 --> 53:01.878
Spiritual leader?

53:01.978 --> 53:04.914
Our center is upstairs
above the theater.

53:05.014 --> 53:09.118
I believe Eli has joined
Guru Sai for lunch.

53:09.219 --> 53:11.421
Well, I believe I
would like to join them.

53:20.363 --> 53:20.830
Ah.

53:20.930 --> 53:24.033
There they are.

53:24.133 --> 53:26.402
Have a beautiful day.

53:26.502 --> 53:27.537
You too.

53:27.637 --> 53:28.838
Namaste.

53:28.938 --> 53:29.439
Likewise.

53:49.292 --> 53:51.861
Uncle Sean, what
are you doing here?

53:51.961 --> 53:53.162
Well, that's funny.

53:53.263 --> 53:55.265
I was just going to
ask you the same thing.

53:55.365 --> 53:57.500
I-- had an appointment--

53:57.600 --> 53:58.468
That you moved up.

53:58.568 --> 53:59.669
Yes, I heard.

53:59.769 --> 54:01.604
You're supposed to be in school.

54:01.704 --> 54:04.040
Eli has graced me with
his company for lunch

54:04.140 --> 54:05.742
while I help him with
a school project.

54:05.842 --> 54:08.745
It's for social studies.

54:08.845 --> 54:09.913
Really?

54:10.013 --> 54:10.647
Come, please.

54:10.747 --> 54:12.916
Join us.

54:13.016 --> 54:14.183
I think we should get going.

54:14.284 --> 54:15.852
I'm not going back to school.

54:20.256 --> 54:22.058
Today's lentil
dal day and I doubt

54:22.158 --> 54:25.128
if you've had any better, Mr.?

54:25.228 --> 54:25.995
McAllister.

54:26.095 --> 54:28.464
Sean.

54:28.564 --> 54:31.834
Another bowl for Eli's uncle.

54:31.935 --> 54:34.504
Come.

54:34.604 --> 54:35.171
Very well.

54:40.009 --> 54:40.910
I get the ball, right?

54:41.010 --> 54:41.911
I-- I-- turn.

54:42.011 --> 54:42.812
And there he is.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.047
Bam!

54:44.147 --> 54:45.315
It was my fault we
ran into each other.

54:45.415 --> 54:47.550
I think he's
still seeing birds.

54:49.385 --> 54:50.186
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

54:50.286 --> 54:52.155
You ran the wrong play.

54:52.255 --> 54:53.056
Hey, guys.

54:53.156 --> 54:54.557
Sorry.

54:54.657 --> 54:55.825
I'm just going to sneak in
here and give him his meds.

54:55.925 --> 54:56.893
OK?

54:56.993 --> 54:58.795
Yeah, we should,
uh, probably go.

54:58.895 --> 55:00.863
No!

55:00.964 --> 55:02.332
No, you don't have to leave.

55:06.402 --> 55:10.773
I mean, we're having
such-- such a nice time.

55:10.873 --> 55:12.475
Hey, it's OK.

55:12.575 --> 55:15.078
I-- uh, I could
come back tomorrow.

55:15.178 --> 55:17.647
What time's good?

55:17.747 --> 55:20.016
Anytime is good.

55:20.116 --> 55:20.616
Bye.

55:23.653 --> 55:24.520
See you, hon.

55:24.620 --> 55:25.888
Bye, sweetie.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.256
Ah, thank you.

55:27.357 --> 55:29.826
We'll see you.

55:29.926 --> 55:30.793
Love you, honey.

55:30.893 --> 55:32.362
Bye.

55:32.462 --> 55:32.795
Bye.

55:32.895 --> 55:34.263
Thanks.

55:34.364 --> 55:35.098
Call you tomorrow?

55:35.198 --> 55:36.432
Yes.

55:36.532 --> 55:36.866
Great.

55:36.966 --> 55:37.500
OK.

55:37.600 --> 55:37.867
Perfect.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.743
Ana.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.011
Yeah?

55:48.111 --> 55:49.712
Can I talk to you
over here for a minute?

55:49.812 --> 55:50.780
Sure, what's up?

55:56.419 --> 55:58.621
You couldn't have
waited one minute.

55:58.721 --> 56:01.157
Glenn, we have to
stay ahead of the pain,

56:01.257 --> 56:03.559
or it's going to get
really bad, really fast.

56:03.659 --> 56:04.260
He was fine.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.561
He was not in pain.

56:05.661 --> 56:07.296
He was having a good
time with his friends.

56:07.397 --> 56:08.164
He was enjoying them.

56:08.264 --> 56:09.399
I know, I understand.

56:09.499 --> 56:10.733
But your husband's
a really stoic guy,

56:10.833 --> 56:13.069
and he doesn't want you
to know if he's in pain.

56:13.169 --> 56:14.604
But I can assure you, he is.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.540
And keeping him Medicated
makes your job that much easier.

56:17.640 --> 56:18.841
No, no, no.

56:18.941 --> 56:20.710
No, because then you just
have a nice, quiet patient.

56:20.810 --> 56:21.944
Right?

56:22.045 --> 56:22.879
It's not about that.

56:22.979 --> 56:23.880
Just give him the shot.

57:03.553 --> 57:06.789
Although reincarnation sounds
pretty neat, not all of us

57:06.889 --> 57:08.991
want to come back
for another life.

57:09.092 --> 57:11.894
How do not come back?

57:11.994 --> 57:12.929
Have you heard of karma?

57:16.365 --> 57:19.435
Ah, your dal.

57:19.535 --> 57:22.205
Simply put, karma
is the universal law

57:22.305 --> 57:24.240
of action and reaction.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.143
Good actions gain
good reactions.

57:27.243 --> 57:30.847
And evil actions
bear evil reactions.

57:30.947 --> 57:34.817
If one's karma is really good,
one can get out of coming back.

57:34.917 --> 57:39.088
So, what if you do
something in this life,

57:39.188 --> 57:42.291
but you didn't mean to.

57:42.391 --> 57:43.526
You know.

57:43.626 --> 57:47.263
It-- it wasn't your
fault, not really.

57:47.363 --> 57:52.368
But, you had to carry it.

57:52.468 --> 57:55.872
It's impossible for us to
predict our future lives.

57:55.972 --> 57:59.876
But we believe that if a
man's good deeds balance

57:59.976 --> 58:04.247
his bad deeds, his soul
will be united with Krishna.

58:04.347 --> 58:08.050
Is there any proof
that incarnation exists?

58:08.151 --> 58:10.486
Proof is all around you.

58:10.586 --> 58:13.489
Just look at nature.

58:13.589 --> 58:15.691
In the summer, the
tree flourishes.

58:20.062 --> 58:23.432
And in the winter, it
loses its leaves and dies.

58:26.903 --> 58:31.641
And there it is in the spring,
alive and full of beauty.

58:34.644 --> 58:39.282
This is the cruel cycle of life.

58:39.382 --> 58:41.551
We humans think we
are apart from it,

58:41.651 --> 58:43.953
but the truth is we are not.

58:49.425 --> 58:51.260
Oh, there's grandpa's truck.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.395
He'll drive me home.

58:56.098 --> 58:59.101
You're not going to tell my
mom about today, are you?

59:03.239 --> 59:03.973
Hey, Eli.

59:06.542 --> 59:10.713
I think that God looks
at soldiers differently.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.816
And think he sees they do
things they don't want to.

59:13.916 --> 59:16.786
I thought you don't
believe in God.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.421
I don't.

59:18.521 --> 59:20.623
But if I did, I think
he'd be super smart,

59:20.723 --> 59:23.192
and he'd see the whole
picture and all the--

59:23.292 --> 59:24.493
Extenuating circumstances.

59:26.862 --> 59:27.163
Yeah.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.401
What are you doing?

59:32.501 --> 59:33.836
Just getting my stuff.

59:39.008 --> 59:43.346
You know, maybe I'll
come in for a while.

59:43.446 --> 59:44.447
Oh.

59:44.547 --> 59:45.414
Yeah, yeah.

59:45.514 --> 59:46.482
If you-- if you want to.

59:46.582 --> 59:48.417
Check out the team.

59:48.517 --> 59:50.086
That sounds great.

59:50.186 --> 59:52.054
Yeah.

59:52.154 --> 59:52.655
Yeah.

59:59.462 --> 01:00:00.596
Hey!

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:01.631
I thought I told you
to bring me Coke.

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:02.331
Uh!

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:03.899
My back!

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.269
For God's sakes, Hal!

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.170
What-- here.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.772
Easy.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:10.306
Dad.

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.073
Dad.

01:00:11.173 --> 01:00:11.974
Don't do that.

01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:12.908
You might make it worse.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.243
Tell them to go
get an ambulance.

01:00:14.343 --> 01:00:15.077
Oh, he doesn't
need an ambulance.

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:15.778
It's just a spasm.

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:16.178
He might.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.480
Dad.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.114
Uncle Hal, has this
ever happened before?

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:18.881
Yeah.

01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:20.016
20 years ago.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.485
20 years ago, you got
to be kidding me, Hal.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.186
What are you doing?

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.488
Yeah, pour it on
his face genius.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:26.789
That'll help.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:27.823
What happened?

01:00:27.923 --> 01:00:28.858
Nothing.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.092
He's fine.

01:00:30.192 --> 01:00:31.227
There were a couple
paramedics in the coffee shop.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.194
They'll be right down.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.362
Thank you.

01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:33.963
Listen, you're going
to be fine, Hal.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.231
OK?

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.033
Guess this sort of kills
the Fiesta Cup for you, Dick?

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:37.633
Too bad.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.306
What did you say?

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:44.340
Easy there, big fellow.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.375
I'm just stating the obvious.

01:00:46.475 --> 01:00:48.311
You know what's obvious, Tim.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.645
You are an asshole.

01:00:49.745 --> 01:00:52.181
That's what's obvious.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:52.848
Calm down.

01:00:52.948 --> 01:00:53.816
Dick.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.084
Don't tell me to
calm down, asshole.

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.919
You want to watch
the language, old man?

01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:59.288
You want to see what an
old man can do to you?

01:00:59.388 --> 01:01:02.224
You want to see that?

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.392
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:04.960
I guess you will.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:05.461
Come on.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.228
Let it go.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:06.662
Good luck.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.435
I'll be better tomorrow, Dick.

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:13.436
You'll be OK, Hal.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:14.704
Just take it easy.

01:01:24.613 --> 01:01:26.816
What are we going to do?

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.250
I'm afraid that's it, kiddo.

01:01:30.886 --> 01:01:32.988
It's too late for me to
find someone else, Eli.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:33.989
I'm sorry.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:34.690
No.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.524
You can't just give up.

01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:36.525
I'm not giving up.

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:37.259
We just don't have a choice.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.394
Yes, we--

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.862
Eli, I know you're
disappointed.

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.098
No-- you're the one that
always says we can't give up.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:42.765
Eli.

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.334
No!

01:01:45.434 --> 01:01:48.371
Eli, it's OK.

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.138
No.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.539
No, it's not.

01:01:50.639 --> 01:01:52.274
We can't give up.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.876
Come here.

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:56.011
You know I would do
anything for you.

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.713
But the tournament
is tomorrow morning.

01:01:57.813 --> 01:02:02.952
But-- I promised my dad--

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:06.655
What did you
promise your dad?

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:07.990
That we'd bring him the cup.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.567
I could bowl for Hal.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.939
I'm a little-- a lot rusty.

01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:26.409
But-- I could.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.343
Yes!

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:28.244
Yes, yes.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.145
That's a great idea.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:29.779
No.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:30.212
Wait.

01:02:30.312 --> 01:02:31.447
Wait.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:32.982
Uncle Sean said it
was his best sport.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.417
Eli, we're-- we're bowling
against some tough competition

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.251
here.

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.585
Well, who-- what?

01:02:36.685 --> 01:02:38.254
The important thing is
to not give up, right?

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:46.462
When's the last
time you bowled?

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:47.630
Does it matter?

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:55.504
Go get some shoes.

01:02:55.604 --> 01:02:56.105
Yes.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:18.227
Ana?

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:27.236
Uh, I don't need
you anymore, Ana.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.471
What?

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.105
I-- I can stay till
the boys get back.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:30.739
No.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.641
Not just tonight.

01:03:32.741 --> 01:03:35.778
I don't need you anymore at all.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.246
I'm sorry, Glenn.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:41.283
I'll be calling hospice
tomorrow to find a replacement.

01:03:41.383 --> 01:03:43.953
Hey, I'm sorry if I-- I--

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.922
Thank you for everything.

01:03:47.022 --> 01:03:47.356
OK.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:47.957
Please.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.859
OK.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:50.259
OK.

01:04:13.415 --> 01:04:14.483
That's too much shoulder.

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:16.151
Remember-- you want
to shake hands.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.119
You want to--

01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:18.087
Dad.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.421
I got it.

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.656
All right.

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.925
I think you're doing
great, Uncle Sean.

01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:30.666
Come one.

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.301
Oh, and remember-- remember.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.435
We have to be here at 10 AM.

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.418
Shit.

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.321
Are you OK?

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.722
Did you find the remote?

01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:55.291
OK, it's going to be fine.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.625
OK.

01:04:56.725 --> 01:04:58.227
Christ, that took
you long enough.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.795
Oh, here you go, dad.

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:00.696
This is a good show.

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:01.830
There we go.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.399
OK, mom it's fine.

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.234
Can we talk outside?

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:08.938
You head home.

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.272
I'm going to spend
the night here,

01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:12.007
so you're going to have
to get Janie breakfast.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:13.475
And I'll come home early, so
you can make the tournament.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.111
And tell Brenda I will pay
her what I owe her tomorrow.

01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:17.513
Brenda?

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:18.581
The babysitter, Christ!

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:19.214
Oh!

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:19.782
Crap.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.666
Ana?

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:38.267
Mom?

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.548
What?

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.451
Hal hurt his back, so Uncle
Sean is now on the team.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.852
Oh, well.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:06:00.689
That's-- Is Hal OK?

01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:01.957
He's fine.

01:06:02.057 --> 01:06:04.159
Just pulled his back out.

01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:05.761
Where is Ana?

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.062
She went home.

01:06:07.162 --> 01:06:08.831
And Evie went to the
store, and-- and she'll

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:09.798
see you at home.

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:20.643
I'd like to sit with him,
if that's OK with you.

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:21.243
OK.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:24.713
OK.

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:25.214
Let's go.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.557
I love you.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:18.534
We're probably not going
to win the cup this year,

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.903
although it's certainly not
for lack of Eli's trying.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:24.406
That kid is something.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.146
I wish you could see it.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:33.749
Hal's son-in-law
is replacing you

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:39.588
and-- Sean is
replacing [laughs] Hal.

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.795
It's like watching two
giraffes try to bowl.

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:56.572
And the sad thing is--
is that Hal's son-in-law

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:59.341
makes Sean look good.

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:24.633
I was 22 when I had you.

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.477
ANNOUNCER:It's not often
you see such consistency,

01:08:35.577 --> 01:08:38.180
especially when the
stakes are this high.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.585
And there's another
strike for Earl Anthony.

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:47.256
Here's a profile of
Anthony from the back.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.091
Notice how he lifts
the ball straight

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:52.461
through his high hand going
over the top of the ball

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.162
very smoothly.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.631
You know, Bo, Earl Anthony will
probably go down in history

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.834
as one of the greatest
bowlers that every lived,

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.335
if not the greatest.

01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:04.506
Look at his form.

01:09:04.606 --> 01:09:05.374
Right there.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.308
Another strike.

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.111
Doesn't get better than that.

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:12.747
You know just not
on his game today.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:13.448
Piece of cake.

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:29.497
Sean?

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:30.098
Yeah?

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.470
Sean, am I dead?

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.839
No.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.040
You're here with me.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.345
Glenn?

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:44.345
She's sleeping.

01:09:59.127 --> 01:10:02.631
I went somewhere.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.199
Well, you're here now.

01:10:10.672 --> 01:10:11.573
I missed you.

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:16.545
I missed you too.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:21.116
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

01:10:25.587 --> 01:10:26.455
You're here now.

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:40.769
That night-- I
know it was Pinky.

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:30.218
Hey!

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:53.141
Shhhhh.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.148
Shhhh.

01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:06.521
It's OK.

01:12:30.078 --> 01:12:32.314
Mom?

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.515
Oh, it's OK, sweetie.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:34.516
He's just tired.

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:38.854
You ready, Eli?

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.188
Mm-hmm.

01:12:40.288 --> 01:12:42.624
When does Ana get here?

01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:45.794
Oh, she should be
here any minute.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.562
You, OK?

01:12:47.662 --> 01:12:49.798
Yeah.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:53.435
We are going to have that
cup for you when we come home.

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.740
I wouldn't count on it.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:07.516
Good luck.

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:08.650
Listen.

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.018
We're not going to get
past the first round.

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:12.054
But I really, really
appreciate you

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.222
stepping in for us like this.

01:13:14.322 --> 01:13:15.490
Do we have shirts?

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:16.158
Oh, yeah.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.726
I almost forgot.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.694
Here you go.

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:20.662
Yeah.

01:13:20.762 --> 01:13:21.296
Hey.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.197
Sorry we're late.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.098
Put this on.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.199
Go get some shoes.

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.333
Here Eli.

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.204
How about this?

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.872
This is your shirt, huh.

01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:32.441
Eli, listen-- uh, Ben?

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:35.744
Why don't you warm up?

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:36.878
Listen, Eli.

01:13:36.978 --> 01:13:38.914
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:41.583
I mean, there's three
rounds to this tournament.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:44.419
And we probably won't make
it past the first round.

01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:46.755
So, we're all going to have
to be OK with that, you know.

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:49.491
I mean, winning is always
great, but your dad

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.494
will be proud of us with
or without that cup.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:55.864
But the important thing is-- the
fact thing is we did not quit.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.167
Grandpa!

01:13:59.267 --> 01:14:00.469
Did that just happen?

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:10.812
You're so beautiful.

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:24.126
Everyday I would go by the rec
room on my way to football.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:28.497
And I'd hear this
beautiful music.

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:34.503
And I'd stop in the
hallway and listen.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:39.407
One day I worked up the
nerve, and I opened the door

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.575
and there you were.

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:50.485
There
were so many things.

01:14:55.323 --> 01:15:05.100
So many horrible things,
till I saw-- and I did.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:18.413
And then I would imagine
myself back in that hall again.

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:20.615
Outside that door
listening to you.

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:26.988
Glenn.

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:32.594
I can't fight this.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:20.435
Hey, how are you?

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:23.638
He's at the tournament.

01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:24.039
Who?

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:28.009
Eli?

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:38.586
Eli.

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:24.332
Right now is not the
time to get psyched out.

01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:27.001
We are just going
to bowl our game.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.970
We're not going to
overthink it. or try

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:33.274
to analyze anything, like--
like how we got here, how

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.843
in the hell Ben is bowling 270.

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:35.577
Who cares?

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.245
Who cares?

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.713
All right.

01:18:38.813 --> 01:18:40.949
We're just going to go out
there, focus on the pins,

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.283
and move.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.785
All right?

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:46.554
Oh, if you're nervous, don't
let them see your nerves.

01:18:46.654 --> 01:18:47.555
Just don't.

01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:49.391
You know, it's easy, breezy.

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:51.960
Easy.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.961
Let's do it.

01:20:21.015 --> 01:20:23.117
If he hits 10 pins,
I think it's over.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.211
We need a strike to win, kiddo.

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.962
Uncle Sean.

01:21:08.062 --> 01:21:10.131
I think my dad's
okay with second.

01:22:28.409 --> 01:22:30.712
Love you, dad.

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.714
I love you, too, son.

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:33.881
I love you, too.

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:49.330
Glenn, I have--

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.675
Hey.

01:23:16.357 --> 01:23:18.159
I think I'm going to
head over to Rick's.

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:18.860
OK.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.161
I'll head up with Sean.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:20.662
Hey, Bill.

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:21.262
Huh?

01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:22.630
Huh?

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:24.032
Hey, I got to go pee.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:25.633
Can, um-- Can you hold the cup?

01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:28.202
Yeah, of course.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.795
Not so tough now, are you?

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:54.796
Hey, hey, hey!

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.398
Get off of him.

01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:57.999
You OK, Eli?

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.103
What's going on?

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.639
This guy, he pushed me, dad.

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.007
Did you touch my kid?

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.475
I was getting him off my nephew.

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:10.344
Don't you ever touch my kid?

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.680
Then, keep your
animal away from him.

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.750
What did you say?

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.285
You heard me.

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.386
Now move.

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.488
Not until you
apologize to my son.

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.723
It's not going to happen.

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:25.193
Then we got a problem.

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:27.495
I'm not going to
fight you, Tim.

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:29.163
Of course not.

01:24:29.263 --> 01:24:31.532
You'd rather have your
brother fight all your battles

01:24:31.632 --> 01:24:33.301
for you, faggot.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.307
Grandpa!

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.109
There's someone--
somebody's hurting

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:44.712
Uncle Sean in the bathroom.

01:24:44.812 --> 01:24:46.114
What the hell?

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:48.850
Not such hot stuff now, are you?

01:24:52.453 --> 01:24:54.489
Get off me!

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.160
Sorry, Dick.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.229
You should have let your
fag fight his own fights.

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:21.349
Can you drive?

01:26:02.089 --> 01:26:03.591
Thank you so much.

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.206
Hello?

01:26:52.306 --> 01:26:53.341
Can-- can you come?

01:27:21.335 --> 01:27:21.636
Dad?

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.049
Eli?

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.650
Dad!

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.656
Eli!

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:42.256
Dad!

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:45.660
Dad!

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.395
Eli!

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:48.329
Dad!

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.764
Eli, what are you doing?

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:50.598
It's dad.

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.999
He's coming back.

01:27:52.099 --> 01:27:54.936
I-- I saw the star, just like
in Evie's story-- a-- a falling

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:55.569
star.

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.671
Oh, Eli.

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.205
It means that the soul
is coming back, mom.

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.941
He-- he's coming back.

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.543
It's his second chance.

01:28:02.643 --> 01:28:04.211
Eli, honey.

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:05.947
He's not coming back.

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.882
But I saw the star.

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:09.850
Oh, Eli.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.285
He's not coming back.

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:12.920
But Evie's story--

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:14.722
It was just a story.

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:15.756
No.

01:28:15.856 --> 01:28:16.691
No.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.293
Yeah.

01:28:19.393 --> 01:28:20.294
No.

01:28:20.394 --> 01:28:22.964
But I don't know
where he is, mom.

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:23.931
OK.

01:28:24.031 --> 01:28:25.866
I don't know where he is.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.168
Eli.

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:29.003
Listen to me.

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:33.007
You do not have to
look for your father,

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.208
because he is right here.

01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:36.711
He is with us.

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:37.611
He is with you.

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.347
He is always with you.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:44.719
And I am so sorry that you have
had to go through this alone.

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:45.820
But I'm here.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.888
I'm here now.

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.457
OK?

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:50.024
Mom!

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:52.460
Shhh, it's OK.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.462
Oh, it's OK.

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.830
It's OK.

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:02.803
It's OK, Eli.

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:35.936
Sean?

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:45.780
I'm sorry, Sean.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.747
So sorry.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.256
Nice jeans there, Pinky.

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:56.991
Studs for the stud.

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:58.459
Hey, Pinky's on the prowl.

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.995
Why are you
calling John, Pinky?

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:02.096
It's his new nickname.

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.531
Show him.

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.598
Oh my god!

01:30:04.698 --> 01:30:06.434
Come on, dude.

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:08.335
--in the
game last Saturday, man.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.971
This-- this safety
ruined my finger.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.139
Oh, poor baby.

01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:13.140
You need to go take
a nap.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.341
I'll see you later, man.

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:15.242
See you later.

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.987
Where did Earl Anthony go?

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:03.624
Well, that depends
on who you ask.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:07.194
For me, my father's
never very far.

01:31:07.294 --> 01:31:09.530
I see him in the way my
grandfather looks at me

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.434
and calls me kiddo-- the way my
uncle tells me about the things

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:18.372
they did as boys-- the
way Evie's always there,

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.341
and in the way my
mother plays piano

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:21.742
until I fall asleep at night.

01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:28.182
For the love they shared with
him, goes through each of them

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:36.790
and back and forth to me-- and
is and always will be mine.

01:31:47.434 --> 01:31:51.038
I'm sure what it'll
be like when I die.

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:55.843
I'm not sure if I'll be
scared them or ready to go.

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:58.746
I just hope that I see all
the places that I want to see,

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.681
and do all the things
that I want to do

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:04.485
and that I love all the people
that I love, best that I can.

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:12.526
And if that happens, I think
the hardest part about dying

01:32:12.626 --> 01:32:16.030
will just be letting go.
