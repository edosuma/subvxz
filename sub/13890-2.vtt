00:40.000 --> 00:41.999
No way this will work.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.960
I will probably end up in your
head. Or someone else's legs.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.999
Something always goes wrong.
I'm not building my hopes up.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.999
And we begin.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.999
Have you found any dirt on her yet?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.999
–Her character is flawless, sir.
–Damn!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.999
And if her character is flawless, that means…

01:07.400 --> 01:10.700
–I know. I'll have to frame her.
–No, sir! I mean…

01:12.000 --> 01:16.290
Is working. Now if calculation's correct,
portal should open now.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.999
It's working!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.999
Something is not right.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.499
It's saying we don't exist.
How can this be possible?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.999
Taking us to nearest valid reality.
Makes no sense.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.346
–What size is this?
–This baby is 50 inches of full
crotch throbbing pixel power.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.499
I like it.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.960
Too big, is anything for the bedroom?

02:02.000 --> 02:05.999
–I don't know how much long I…
–…It's crazy.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.999
What about this one?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.999
I don't know how much longer…

02:13.000 --> 02:16.999
Yes, something is real. Send
Rimmer to first see it's safe.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.999
–What?
–Wait!

02:24.000 --> 02:27.999
<i>I said waaaaaaait!</i>

02:32.000 --> 02:33.999
What was that?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.999
Did you hear something smash?
–On TV.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.999
I don't know how much longer…

02:53.000 --> 02:56.999
–Was it HD?
–Yes, a submersion of HD. (? )

03:37.000 --> 03:41.960
–Where are we, Kryten?
–Well, according to the Psi-scan, sir,
we're in a department store in London

03:42.000 --> 03:45.960
in the early part of the 21st century.
–Early part of the 21st…

03:46.000 --> 03:50.554
Isn't that when all the banks went
belly up and money became useless?

03:50.600 --> 03:52.712
I've read about that in history.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.822
What a sound system, eh? Sounds
like you're in the room, with them.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.112
Red Dwarf. There's a new series?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.112
I don't really follow it myself.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.760
Science-fiction. It's a little
bit bollocks really, isn't it?

04:09.800 --> 04:12.960
That Psi-scan thing.
Knows everything, doesn't it?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.999
Any bit of exposition,
just ask the Psi-scan.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.101
How can it know everything?
Talk about rubbish.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.999
Who's he, crack?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.864
Well, according to the Psi-scan, sir,
he's a pompous know-all know-nothing
idiot called Mike Mellington.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.960
Coincidentally has a very small penis.
–How does a Psi-scan know that?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.960
Well it scanned his e-mail, sir.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.960
He's already onto his 4th tub
of penis enlargement cream.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.999
Hey buds, the photo's closed.
We can't get back!

04:42.000 --> 04:43.960
What do you mean get back?
We are back!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.999
This is Earth. This is home!

04:46.000 --> 04:49.894
And we got rid of Kremlin Kate,
let's crack open the vodka.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.500
Is it me or is everyone staring?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.770
Also, they all seem to be
in smirk mode, sir.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.960
They're just laughing at your face, Kryten.
Nothing to worry about.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.960
Back in the 21st century, they laughed
at freaks all the time.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.960
They used to have TV shows on Saturday night,
where they gathered all the freaks,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.960
make them sing and dance,
then point and laugh at them.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.999
Simple people, simple tastes.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.560
Hey, Hey! What are these things?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.560
They're digital versatile discs, sir.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.560
DVDs for short. They were very popular
at the early part of the 21st century,

05:30.600 --> 05:34.599
before they died out and were replaced
by what we use now.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.659
–Well, you mean videos.
–Precisely.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.620
Back then no one knew,
that the human race

05:39.660 --> 05:42.620
were utterly incapable of putting
the DVDs back in their cases.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.659
You can see the point.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.960
Over two trillion went missing
in just over 20 years.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.112
Videos are just too big to lose.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.669
Sirs, look!

05:56.670 --> 05:58.669
Red Dwarf! This is us!

05:58.700 --> 06:00.699
It's a TV series about us.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.660
It recounts all our adventures.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.699
Every single one of them.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.699
How's this possible?

06:07.700 --> 06:10.699
Wait, we're characters from a TV series

06:10.700 --> 06:14.132
who somehow escaped the TV well
into the real world.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.660
That explains why the dimension cutter
said our reality wasn't valid.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.960
I'm not real!
I'm a character in a TV series.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.999
I'm not real?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.999
That explains so much…

06:26.000 --> 06:27.999
I'm not real either?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.168
Does that mean I'm not
really this good looking?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.844
Just typical of my luck, isn't it.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.560
Just when things start to go right
it turns out that I'm…

06:38.600 --> 06:40.599
I'm not real.
Fantastic!

06:40.600 --> 06:43.560
But now, sirs. We need clear
heads and equinimity.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.560
Naturally, it's extremely disturbing to discover
that we are just characters in a TV series.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.599
And naturally there's going to be a period
of climatisation.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.599
But it's essential that we
keep all this in perspective.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.560
We're not real! What are we gonna do?

06:58.600 --> 07:02.560
There! I think that's pretty
much put in perspective,
don't you think?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.599
This is too weird for words.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.599
Hey guys, look at this!

07:10.600 --> 07:13.599
Back to Earth.
That's the story we're in now.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.599
He's right, look!

07:33.600 --> 07:35.599
There's no disc in it.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.599
Coming soon, it's not out yet.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.599
Back to Earth. Takes place after series X.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.599
Kochanski's dead and the crew
are held through a portal

07:47.600 --> 07:51.599
to discover they're just
characters from a TV series.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.599
Knowing they will die in the final episode—

07:54.600 --> 07:59.599
–Die?
…the dwarfs in a best Blade Runner tradition

07:59.600 --> 08:02.560
track down their creators
to plead for more life.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.599
How are we gonna do that?

08:04.600 --> 08:08.560
Easy! Hey buds, give us more life,
I'm pleading with you! See?

08:08.600 --> 08:12.599
First the crew attempt
to track down the actors

08:13.600 --> 08:17.560
that play them in the series and
their metaphysical odyssey begins.

08:17.600 --> 08:22.560
All my life I wanted to go
on a metaphysical odyssey!
For years! I never thought I'd get the chance!

08:22.600 --> 08:26.599
–So what happens next?
–It says it's a three-parter.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.599
No, not a three-parter!
I hate three-parters!

08:29.600 --> 08:31.599
What if I'm not in that night?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.599
Say I'm busy. What if?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.599
Oh, tell you what.
Toilets here are medieval.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.599
Bet you felt right at home.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.560
There's no toilet paper. They
don't use it in these days.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.560
Like I said, they were simple people.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.560
They eat spam.
–I mean there I am—
in the cubicle, no paper…

08:58.600 --> 09:00.599
wondering what to do.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.418
I open the door and see this machine on the wall
which blows out hot air.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.599
Then a twig!

09:07.600 --> 09:10.560
Tell you what, they got a different system here.
–Different system?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.560
Yeah, well, you gotta
wash yourself in the sinks.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.599
And use the air machine to dry your bum.

09:16.600 --> 09:21.560
–And that's what you did?
–No choice. And those air
machines are really hot.

09:21.600 --> 09:27.560
It's like you're holding your cheeks apart,
jumping up and down trying to catch some breeze.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.560
I'll tell you something, they're
not friendly around here.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.599
Trying to start a conversation—
not once, no.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.599
Where's Cat and Kryten?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.560
They went to get some money.
Haven't got to be between us.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.560
–Money? How they're gonna get money?
–Some second hand shop.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.560
Kryten's gonna try and pawn his head.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.599
And what about seeing?

09:45.600 --> 09:48.560
He can use his spare set of eyes.
Hanging out of his neckhole.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.860
Well that's a good look, isn't it?
That's not gonna stand out at all!

09:52.900 --> 09:54.899
–Hey!
–Any luck?

09:54.900 --> 09:57.860
They thought we were from a
hidden camera show, sir,

09:57.900 --> 09:59.860
and wouldn't take us seriously!

09:59.900 --> 10:02.860
We even offered to throw in one of his legs.
Still no deal.

10:02.900 --> 10:06.860
How are we gonna trace our creators?
We ain't got no wheels, ain't got no dough.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.210
Money. I know how we can get money.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.899
How much we got?

10:20.900 --> 10:24.899
We've got 15 combs, 2 mobile phones,
3 packets of gum,

10:24.900 --> 10:29.058
2 condoms, 2 pairs of reading glasses
and 19 pieces of popcorn.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.860
I'm expecting to pull out Glenn
Miller or Shurgar anytime.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.899
What about the money?

10:35.900 --> 10:38.899
So far we got 19 pounds and 43 pence.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.899
Now what?

10:40.900 --> 10:44.860
Well, according to this, we get on the tube
and we go to a science fiction shop called:

10:44.900 --> 10:47.899
“They walk among us”.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.899
This is too weird for words.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.899
Hey buds, check this!

11:28.900 --> 11:30.899
Look, that's me!

11:30.900 --> 11:34.899
Look at that! And that!

11:42.600 --> 11:45.599
–Listening to music?
–No. Why?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.599
I was just wondering if you could help us.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.560
We're trying to find the
guys involved in the making
of the TV series called Red Dwarf.

11:54.600 --> 11:59.560
We're trying to find out if our show, well,
this is the weird bit— we're not the actors.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.599
We're the real characters.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.042
There was this kinda dimension thing…

12:07.600 --> 12:09.599
Dimension skid, was it?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.560
Happens a lot this time of year.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.599
One minute you're fine, the next…

12:14.600 --> 12:16.599
you're in a new dimension.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.599
Gotta be so careful.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.599
Thank God for that. He's insane.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.599
So you're after, like… cast info?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.599
We need some advice.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.560
I can't give you any numbers,
but I know a man who can.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.560
El presidente of the Red Dwarf Fanclub.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.560
There's nothing that guy doesn't
know about the small rouge one.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.599
We've got a fan club?

12:39.600 --> 12:43.560
You've just got taken over. Bit of a fanatic.
Changes his name to Red Dwarf.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.560
People have to call him Mr Warf.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.560
His sitting room looks just
like your sleeping quarters.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.599
Got an H tattooed on his head.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.599
It's not like us, he's a bit weird.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.599
Redge, dude. It's N… here.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.599
Sorry to interrupt the Warhammer, mate.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.599
Guess who I've got standing in my shop.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.599
Go on, guess! No!

13:08.600 --> 13:15.599
No! No! No! Who? No! No!

13:17.600 --> 13:24.599
Should I tell you? No. No. Should I tell you?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.599
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.599
I've got standing in my shop
the real actual crew from Red Dwarf.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.599
Had a bit of a dimension skid.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.599
Yeah, that's what I said.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.560
Well, they're trying to find out
how many shows they've got left.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.599
Exactly. Need some numbers,
know you've got 'em.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.599
What? Why?

13:48.600 --> 13:52.599
Can't give out cast info.
Space code directive 596.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.599
596?

13:55.600 --> 13:58.834
Love it, when he does this
and gets it all wrong.

13:59.200 --> 14:05.160
596? Spacecode superchimps before made active
decency in zero gravity will
lose all banana privileges.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.358
No, Sir. The crew's files are
for the eyes of the captain only.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.199
So we're smegged.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.199
–What's that?
–That's Dave Lister's bath from season IX.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.160
Best season ever if you ask me.
Awesome season. Best by miles.

14:22.200 --> 14:29.460
You were in that, remember, when Kryten ran in
and told you that Kochanski had
been sucked out of an air lock.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.199
Fish scale?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.199
Not fish!

14:35.200 --> 14:37.199
Could be a bit of poppadom.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.160
Who doesn't need a curry in the bath?

14:39.200 --> 14:43.160
Maybe it's artificial snake scale
from the one Polymorph turned into.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.199
Kryten?

14:45.200 --> 14:49.094
It's got a licence number and a
props maker's name—Swallow.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.199
I've seen that name here.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.199
Hey, here it is.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.199
Swallow & Cast, waiting for taxis
fan convention 2009

15:01.200 --> 15:05.199
Kryten, scan the photo
and beam it onto that TV.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.199
Uncrop.
Wait, what's that?

15:12.200 --> 15:16.160
Frame left. That card. Zoom in.
–Swallow. Pick up. 3 o'clock.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.160
Must be his taxi. Bet the
address is on the other side.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.199
Pull out. Stop. Wait. I've got an idea.
Track in. Stop. Enhance reflection.

15:24.200 --> 15:29.199
Need another reflective surface
to get back across the street.

15:29.200 --> 15:34.199
Zoom in. Pan right. See if
there are any waterdrops
on that lamp post.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.199
Got one. Thanks, fighto. Zoom 80.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.199
Enhance reflection. Stop. Rotate 170

15:41.200 --> 15:45.199
–Zoom 220.
–What's that?

15:45.200 --> 15:49.199
Flop. That's the taxi driver.
There's the business card.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.199
Zoom 260. Rotate 90 degrees.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.199
Track in!
Swallow's business address.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.160
Oh sir, wouldn't it have been quicker
to look him up in the phonebook?

16:00.200 --> 16:06.160
Print me a 4 by 6 and any more remarks like that
I'll ask for an A3 out of your waste disposal.

16:06.200 --> 16:10.820
Makes latex masks for the film and TV industry.
Specializing in noses.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.160
Maybe if we track him down
he'll point us in the right direction.

16:14.200 --> 16:18.160
But sir, how are we gonna get there?
That's over 30 miles away.

16:18.200 --> 16:22.199
–I know. Hollyhop drive.
–Back on Red Dwarf.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.199
–Metapuddle.
–Back on Red Dwarf.

16:26.200 --> 16:31.199
–Time slides, when you walk
into a photograph and…
–Back on Red Dwarf.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.160
–Got it! Beam there!
–That's Star Trek, not us! We don't do that, sir.

16:35.200 --> 16:40.160
All right, if you've got no teleportation systems
or any matter reassemblers,

16:40.200 --> 16:44.199
no option's left: you have to catch the bus.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.199
Neurotic? I'm not neurotic!

16:46.200 --> 16:50.199
I've never been neurotic!
Neurotic? Neurotic?

16:50.200 --> 16:53.199
Are they insane? Who writes this stuff?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.160
I wasn't even neurotic when I was a kid.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.500
Didn't have time, I was
too busy washing my hands.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.199
Hilarious. In what way am I hilarious?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.160
Name one way in which I'm
hilarious. Just one, one way.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.160
Well you're pompous without reason, sir,
and you have hilariously unrealistic life goals.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.160
Well, I'm lord of the star fleet, Kryten
and you'll pay for that remark.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.199
Four for Nundah Street bus stop, please.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.160
Hilariously unrealistic life goals. That's true.
That's so true. That's funny.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.199
Where's first class?

17:28.200 --> 17:30.199
It's all first class, mate!

17:30.200 --> 17:32.199
Excellent!

17:32.200 --> 17:35.160
Looking forward to the complimenatary
champagne and little towels.

17:35.200 --> 17:39.199
Look, let's split up, so we
don't look conspicuous, yeah?

17:45.200 --> 17:47.199
The actress who plays her.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.199
Of course.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.199
She's alive in this dimension, isn't she?

18:03.200 --> 18:08.199
–You are Dave Lister, aren't you?
–Yeah. How do you know?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.199
We watch you with dad on Dave.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.199
Dave?

18:13.200 --> 18:17.952
A TV channel. What's it like, having a whole
TV channel named after you?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.199
You're pretty cool.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.199
Cool?

18:22.200 --> 18:26.160
–You don't take any smeg, that's cool.
–And even though you're disgusting,

18:26.200 --> 18:28.199
sometimes you're quite brave.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.199
Are you sad about Kochanski?

18:37.200 --> 18:41.199
We were sad too. So is dad.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.199
Then we worked it out.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.199
What? What out?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.199
She is not really dead.

18:47.200 --> 18:51.160
Kryten was the only one to see her die, right?
See her get sucked out the air lock.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.199
But she didn't.
–She didn't?

18:53.200 --> 18:58.199
–Kryten made it up.
–Why would he do that?

18:58.200 --> 19:02.199
–You were a mess, falling apart.
–Drinking, being deaf.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.160
She couldn't bear to stand and
watch you die. And you wouldn't listen.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.160
So she took the blue midget and acted it.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.199
Why would Kryten lie to me?

19:10.200 --> 19:13.199
She was only trying to save your feelings.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.292
So you wouldn't feel like a big fat loser.
You've been dumped.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.199
I was dumped once. It was really horrible.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.199
Dumped?

19:27.200 --> 19:30.962
But that would mean, that would
mean she was still alive.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.199
She is still alive, I bet you!

19:34.200 --> 19:38.199
She's really good at guessing
stuff. That DVD —Titanic—

19:38.200 --> 19:41.160
she knew that ship would
sink right from the start.

19:41.200 --> 19:45.199
She could tell. Even in that bible film.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.199
She said: Jesus— he's not dead. I bet ya.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.160
In next series, try and find her!

19:52.200 --> 19:56.199
Get her back.
–Kiss her! I would.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.160
There isn't gonna be a next series.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.199
I'm a fictional character.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.199
I don't exist.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.199
–I think you exist.
–And I do too.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.199
Hey, our stop!

20:10.200 --> 20:12.199
Just smeg it!

20:19.200 --> 20:24.199
You think you outsmart me, yes?
But you don't. I here.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.199
Cut a second hole.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.160
Science officer. Excellent.
So pleased you've caught up with us.

20:29.200 --> 20:35.199
You gave me slip, I know. You not want be erased,
but you won't defeat me. I too smart.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.199
Erase me? I thought it was
murder to kill a hologram.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.199
No. Hologram already dead.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.199
Morally, ethically, hologram killing fine.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.199
Fair enough.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.199
Come on. We haven't got all day.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.199
She didn't see that coming,
did she? I did.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.160
Man, this is too weird for words.

21:01.200 --> 21:06.199
Nose world. Here it is.
Maker of latex masks for TV industry

21:06.200 --> 21:12.199
specializing in noses.
I didn't know I could read chinese.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.160
You really think this guy
will be able to help?

21:15.200 --> 21:18.160
He worked on the TV show,
we're all fictional characters and

21:18.200 --> 21:20.160
he's got to know the address
of our creator.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.199
Say he doesn't?

21:22.200 --> 21:25.698
Well, at least we'll be able
to pick up a spare nose.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.199
Hey! That's my coat!

21:41.200 --> 21:44.199
Give me that! Where'd you get my coat?

21:44.200 --> 21:47.199
I get from Red Dwarf costume department.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.199
End of series night.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.160
I stole many things, sell on eBay.

21:52.200 --> 21:57.199
I even steal car, from Red
Dwarf fan club president.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.199
Why are you here?

22:01.200 --> 22:05.199
Illogical. You should be inside TV.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.199
Questions need answers.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.199
How many episodes have we got left?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.199
Is it true we're going to die?

22:12.200 --> 22:14.199
I don't know that stuff.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.199
I just do noses.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.199
Latex.
–Who does know?

22:20.200 --> 22:24.199
Big boss. He know everything.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.292
He pick your nose, he pick your brain.
He pick your brain too.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.199
It was a Friday.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.199
How do we get to see him?

22:34.200 --> 22:36.199
I know man who know where.

22:36.200 --> 22:41.199
He know big boss. He know address.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.199
So cold!

22:46.200 --> 22:49.199
You said before you stole a car.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.378
Red Dwarf fan club president car.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.199
You want to borrow?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.199
All legal.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.199
You can't be serious.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.199
We're not driving this!

23:17.200 --> 23:20.199
Sirs, we'll be a laughing stock.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.199
Well, beggars can't be choosers.
