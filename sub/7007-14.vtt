WEBVTT

00:02.402 --> 00:04.666
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.638
Wow! You're home late from work.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.867
I stayed at the mall
and did some shopping.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.035
You guys have no idea
how lucky you are.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.443
When I was your age,
the closest thing to a mall

00:13.513 --> 00:16.812
was a Walgreers with a FotoMat
in the parking lot.

00:16.883 --> 00:21.217
Man, between that and black-and-white
TV, your life was a living hell!

00:22.522 --> 00:24.990
- So, what's in the bag?
- Oh, that's my old shirt.

00:25.058 --> 00:28.585
Check out the new one I bought.
You've never seen anything like it.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.258
Actually, I think I have.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.566
Oh, man!

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.788 --> 01:31.256
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.985
Evening...

01:34.961 --> 01:36.929
Evening, Humpty, Dumpty.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.131
I guess you're wondering
why we're both wearing this.

01:41.201 --> 01:44.967
No. I was wondering why
anyone would wear that shirt.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.604
Do you remember
that investment property?

01:49.676 --> 01:52.201
Oh, the house on,
uh, Grant or Shadeland?

01:52.278 --> 01:56.510
Shadeland, right. They came down $2,000.
I, um, I think they're ready to sell.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.848
Do you think it's wise to tie up
your money in a rental property?

01:59.919 --> 02:03.013
The price is right. We're gonna
fix it up, rent it out, then...

02:03.089 --> 02:06.456
Why are we discussing our
financial choices with you kids?

02:06.559 --> 02:09.892
Two kids dressed like
a pair of lava lamps.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.401
- You want to take a look one more time?
- That's a good idea.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.130
- Get the dishes, set the table.
- What's for dinner?

02:18.204 --> 02:20.866
Whatever Randy decides to make.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.840
Hey, think pork.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.918
If that's the school uniform,
I am not going to high school.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.584
<i>Welcome back to
Tool Time on location.</i>

02:42.662 --> 02:45.222
Thank you, Heidi. For those
of you who just joined us,

02:45.331 --> 02:48.357
My wife and I bought this rental
property as an investment.

02:48.434 --> 02:52.165
We're gonna show you some tips and an
economical way to make this a makeover.

02:52.238 --> 02:55.765
Nothing brightens a room better
than fresh paint. First thing...

03:00.246 --> 03:04.478
We've just taken a tour of the kitchen
where we're gonna have to retile.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.314
A lot of nice stuff in that kitchen.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.946
I can't believe how beautiful
that vintage stove is.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.616
Oh, you're just excited. He found
a 40-year-old French fry in that stove.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.657
- Let's inspect the living room.
- Right.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.788
And after that,
Tim is gonna take a look at the den

03:18.865 --> 03:21.231
while I figure out
what to do in the bathroom.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.861
You're just now figuring that out?

03:24.938 --> 03:28.101
No. But I figured out why we're doing
this show on renovation.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.371
Once again, Tim gets
all his work done for free.

03:31.844 --> 03:35.507
Wow! Mr. Cynical.
I'm just here to do good work, OK?

03:35.582 --> 03:37.311
Any renter's gonna love these.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.147
A fabulous addition to any home.
Don't you think?

03:42.188 --> 03:46.454
This is a tool show,
not the Please Rent My House channel.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.051
Mr. Snippy today, isn't he?

03:49.128 --> 03:52.427
I think someone didn't get
their hot links this morning.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.862
These glass doorknobs are in great
shape. I think they're a little loose.

03:56.936 --> 04:00.064
My wife and I are gonna go in
a different direction.

04:00.139 --> 04:03.506
- Upgrade them with brass fixtures.
- No! You can't get rid of these.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.137
This is part of the house's charm.
I love these doorknobs.

04:07.213 --> 04:10.182
Well, don't get too attached to them.
They'll turn on you.

04:11.884 --> 04:16.253
Next to fresh paint, replacing carpet
is the quick way to update your place.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.449
I don't think so, Heidi.

04:18.524 --> 04:22.551
Why re-carpet when the floors
are a beautiful peg and groove?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.859
- Ooh!
- A big plus for any renter.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.695
You know, Al,
I think you might be right.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.201
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Jill.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.832
- My business partner, my wife Jill.
- You taping? I don't have makeup on!

04:34.907 --> 04:37.273
Oh, you look fine. You look fine, honey.

04:37.377 --> 04:40.312
I'm gonna put the shower curtain
in the bathroom, all right?

04:40.380 --> 04:44.111
That's a beautiful pattern for a shower
curtain, a big plus for any bathroom.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.152
Once we get this fixed up,
any renter's gonna love this house.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.848
Yes, they will.
In fact, I'll take it.

04:49.922 --> 04:53.255
Thanks, Al. We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.656
OK, let's move to the den.
Get that set up.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.494
I'm trying to rent this place.
Don't joke around, OK?

05:00.566 --> 05:03.091
I'm not joking.
I really would like to rent this.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.329
- What?
- Oh, my God.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.302
You'd be the perfect renter.

05:06.372 --> 05:09.341
Do you want Al living
right around the corner from us?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.039
We can carpool! Hey!

05:12.111 --> 05:14.477
You're not helping your case, Al.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.107
I've been wanting to get out
of that bachelor apartment for years!

05:18.184 --> 05:19.651
I would love living here!

05:19.719 --> 05:22.984
Al is clean. He's quiet.
He'd be the perfect tenant.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.354
I was Tenant of the Month
11 times last year.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.986
- What do you think?
- Please?

05:30.229 --> 05:32.561
Don't beg, you look like
those circus poodles.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.061
I don't know.
Well, why not?

05:38.137 --> 05:41.402
Oh, yes! All right!
Oh, I'm gonna love living here!

05:41.474 --> 05:44.500
Look, I'll even have a coat closet!

05:46.212 --> 05:48.772
Well, congratulations, Al.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.682
Oh! And with that big back yard,
I'll finally be able to get a dog.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.879
Oh, I'm sorry. No pets.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.446
OK. But, boy, this is gonna be
a nice place for mother to visit.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.049
Like I said... no pets.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.392
I'm gonna pick up Samantha.
We're going to the movies.

06:06.466 --> 06:10.527
Hey, um, Randy and Lauren are going
to the movies, too. Can you take them?

06:10.603 --> 06:12.969
Hey, Randy!

06:16.576 --> 06:19.136
What are you doing?
We agreed this was my shirt night.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.874
Before Samantha told me
this was her favorite shirt.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.916
Lauren said this was her favorite shirt.

06:24.016 --> 06:27.747
I don't want a girlfriend
if I'm gonna have to wear that shirt.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.755
Mark, it's not the clothes that matter.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.451
You'll be rejected based on who you are.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.359
Brad, it's his turn to wear the shirt.
It's only fair.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.364
I've only got a year to wear this shirt
before I grow out of it.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.696
He's got the rest of his life.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.406
Yeah? And you have
the rest of your life to learn math.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.909
Hey, hey, hey!
That is enough, guys!

06:50.977 --> 06:54.936
We're just gonna flip a coin. Whoever
loses takes the shirt back to the store.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.450
- Mark, give me a quarter.
- You know, I'm gonna need that back.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.520
All right, Brad.
You're the oldest so you pick.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.419
- Tails.
- Heads it is. You lose.

07:06.492 --> 07:10.360
Hey, and, uh, while you're up there,
you might want to rethink the pants.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.058
Oh, finally I can get some work done.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.067
Arert you forgetting something?

07:17.036 --> 07:19.334
I love you.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.599
I know. I know.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.242
There was a long line
at that photocopy place.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.772
- I got the documents for our tenant.
- Wait, this is what you had copied?

07:31.851 --> 07:33.341
Uh-huh.

07:33.419 --> 07:36.547
You're making Al sign, what is this,
an 18-page lease?

07:39.492 --> 07:41.153
It's a business venture, honey.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.923
I'm doing this to protect us
and to protect Al.

07:43.996 --> 07:48.763
Oh, I see. You are protecting your
best friend by asking for references?

07:50.403 --> 07:53.167
You'll notice I gave him a glowing one.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.308
According to this
sworn statement here,

07:57.376 --> 07:59.742
his apartment manager says

07:59.812 --> 08:03.304
that he once neglected
to clean out a lint trap.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.485
Yep.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.953
I had to grill that old lady six hours
to get her to rat him out.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.923
I can't believe it!
You asked for Al's credit history?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.324
You got it. Look back here.

08:15.394 --> 08:19.763
1987, he bounced an $8 check
at Cheese World.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.995
Ah, here it is!

08:24.070 --> 08:27.096
Captain Jerky's Meat-Curing Kit.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.737
Hey, Tim. It's open.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.813
Hey, Al. The place looks great.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.179
I brought over your
signed copy of the lease.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.684
Without a forklift?

08:42.321 --> 08:44.983
I can't believe you had me
sign an 18-page lease.

08:45.057 --> 08:48.220
You know, my last lease was two pages.
Don't you trust me?

08:48.294 --> 08:51.024
Al, of course I trust you.

08:51.097 --> 08:54.328
I got one little addendum
I want you to sign, though, right here.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.962
There you go.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.033
A "no gravy in the bedroom" clause?

09:03.809 --> 09:06.039
As long as I'm here,
anything else you need?

09:06.112 --> 09:08.637
As a matter of fact, there is.
You know what?

09:08.714 --> 09:11.080
The, uh, the sink in the kitchen
here is leaking.

09:11.183 --> 09:14.914
And this window up here
seems to be a little bit stuck.

09:14.987 --> 09:18.115
Just get a washer for the faucet
and put some silicone on there.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.919
Here you go.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.760
Well, you see, I'm the tenant.

09:22.828 --> 09:26.730
And repairs would be
the landlord's responsibility.

09:26.799 --> 09:30.326
Come on. Tenant, landlord... let's not
get hung up on the labels, buddy.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.031
Well, you want to go by the book,
I'm going by the book.

09:33.105 --> 09:37.337
And according to section 12,
paragraph seven,

09:37.410 --> 09:40.379
uh, you "are responsible for all repairs

09:40.446 --> 09:43.415
or I have someone do it
and take it out of the rent."

09:48.087 --> 09:50.453
Buddy, buddy, buddy...

09:51.657 --> 09:55.991
Close examination of the spirit of this
lease will inform you that that's...

09:56.062 --> 09:58.189
...a sign for renters
that are not handy.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.824
You are very good with your hands.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.767
Speaking of which, here you go.
Right there.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.105
All right. I will sign your addendum.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.665
Good. Uh-huh.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.608
Date it.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.645
OK.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.685
Now you fix my house.

10:20.319 --> 10:21.877
Come on.

10:21.988 --> 10:26.049
You wouldn't be ashamed to have
someone else repair stuff you could do?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.753
Not in the least.

10:29.895 --> 10:33.331
- You really want me fixing this?
- You wouldn't be my first choice.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.559
But...

10:36.035 --> 10:40.597
...I'll be right here behind you
watching every move you make, "buddy!"

10:43.442 --> 10:46.275
Tim, you're using the wrong
wrench on that faucet.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.315
You ask me to fix your house.
Now you don't trust me to do it right?

10:54.053 --> 10:57.113
I didn't trust you before I asked you.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.591
Thanks to your credit checks, they don't
trust me at Cheese World anymore.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.349
Al, would you hand me
the WD-40, please?

11:24.450 --> 11:27.010
Sorry, landlord. No can do.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.485
According to Public Act
Number 42 of 1917,

11:32.558 --> 11:35.026
that's not the tenant's responsibility.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.552
OK, what is
the tenant's responsibility?

11:38.631 --> 11:43.500
I believe it's to pay the rent
and not eat gravy in the bedroom.

11:52.645 --> 11:56.172
Al, are you gonna eat that apple
the entire time I'm fixing the doorknob?

11:56.248 --> 12:00.947
No. At the rate you're going, I'll be
able to fit in two pears and a plum.

12:02.922 --> 12:07.291
After you've fixed this door, I want you
to take a look at the, uh, chimney here.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.226
Al, I don't have time for this.
A lot of this stuff you could do.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.824
You're right. And for $200 an hour,
I would love to.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.966
You'd charge me for this?

12:18.037 --> 12:20.972
I'm just exercising
my tenant's rights.

12:22.108 --> 12:26.067
This really isn't working out. Maybe you
should find some other place to live.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.146
What? Are you throwing me out?

12:28.214 --> 12:31.149
- No.
- Good. Because you can't evict me.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.913
- Oh, yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.147
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't. I'll sue you.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.780
I have an ironclad lease!

12:37.890 --> 12:42.259
That won't hold up in a court of law.
I know. I wrote it.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.168
I don't believe this!
You told Al that you want to evict him?

12:52.238 --> 12:55.696
That's right. Because he's
the tenant from hell all of a sudden.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.438
He's chasing me around the house
making me do everything by the law.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.446
Well... What about you?

13:01.514 --> 13:05.473
I mean, you've done everything to him
short of running fingerprints on him.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.888
No! You did not!

13:10.890 --> 13:13.222
It may have been a computer error,

13:13.292 --> 13:16.921
but I think he's wanted in Texas
on mail fraud charges.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.057
Oh, Tim!

13:20.132 --> 13:22.965
I mean, it took him
all his courage, you know,

13:23.035 --> 13:24.798
to get out of that cramped apartment.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.930
Then kick him out on the street.
How could you do that to poor Al?

13:28.007 --> 13:32.171
Poor Al, my foot.
How about poor me? He wants to sue me.

13:32.244 --> 13:36.180
And that bonehead would probably take
this right to the Supreme Court.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.945
You won't stand a chance.
Sandra Day O'Connor's gonna love Al.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.954
Gidget?

13:44.890 --> 13:47.791
Have you thought about
any of the ramifications of this?

13:47.860 --> 13:51.318
I mean, you two work together.
What's gonna happen to your friendship?

13:51.397 --> 13:54.560
That will be for
the courts to decide, honey.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.396
You're not going to work this out?

13:56.468 --> 13:59.198
No. Because even if I did,

13:59.271 --> 14:02.968
I run the risk of Al forcing me
to snake out his toilets.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.408
And that's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.180
If you're not gonna talk to him,
then I'm gonna do it for you.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.217
Oh, good. Good luck.

14:12.318 --> 14:16.618
Go over there and talk, you'll end up
sucking asbestos out of his attic.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.896
Wilson, if you need firewood,
I got plenty here.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.938
You don't have to chop down your house.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.303
No, no, no, Tim.
I'm just knocking down some icicles.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.575
One of my favorite things,

14:39.645 --> 14:43.206
right up there with spreading
steer manure on a hot summer day.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.410
I'd rather spread steer manure
than be Al's landlord.

14:47.486 --> 14:51.513
Really? I would've thought
Al would've been the perfect tenant.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.356
That's why I gave him such
an enthusiastic reference.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.123
Maybe I went a little bit overboard.

14:58.197 --> 15:01.963
You're the only one that quoted
Shakespeare on a rental application.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.695
So, you're saying objectively

15:05.771 --> 15:10.333
that the person at fault
is the lessee as opposed to the lessor.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.939
More or less.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.811
Well, so what happened?

15:17.883 --> 15:20.113
We're just disagreeing over the lease.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.346
So, I'm... I'm gonna have to evict him.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.515
Well, Tim, I'm shocked that
you would evict your best friend.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.321
I'm more shocked that you would
make him sign a lease.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.157
I'm new at the landlord thing.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.356
I'm trying to do
everything businesslike.

15:32.431 --> 15:36.800
Tim, let me ask, if I was renting from
you, would you make me sign a lease?

15:36.902 --> 15:39.632
Well... yeah.

15:39.705 --> 15:43.641
Probably let you skip the... the
fingerprinting and the blood samples.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.609
Tim, a landlord doesn't have to do that.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.377
They don't have to do that.
When I do something new,

15:52.451 --> 15:54.009
I like to go at it full strength!

15:54.086 --> 15:56.452
Like the time you brought home
the riding mower.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.013
I didn't have to put 120 horsepower
in that thing.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.616
I did 'cause there's nothing
better than adding...

16:01.694 --> 16:04.060
More power.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.492
There's a difference between
powering up a lawnmower

16:07.566 --> 16:10.194
and lording it over your best friend.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.635
You know, Henry Adams
the historian said,

16:12.738 --> 16:16.003
"A friend in power is a friend lost."

16:16.875 --> 16:19.571
I might've got a bit crazy on that.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.808
Twenty-one clauses and
that thorough investigation.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.478
Well, what did you gain from that?

16:26.552 --> 16:29.646
Well, I lost my first tenant,
my best friend.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.383
I've got a huge photocopy bill.

16:33.492 --> 16:37.258
But they carved a head of me up there
at Cheese World. They set it out.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.834
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Jill.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.501
Can I come in?

16:53.445 --> 16:56.346
It's your house.
You can do whatever you want to.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.375
I brought you a housewarming gift.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.481
Why would you do that?
Your husband is trying to evict me.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.258
Well, I think he's totally out of line.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.987
You really think that?
Oh, I'm so glad you think that!

17:10.061 --> 17:11.551
Thank you! Oh!

17:11.630 --> 17:14.758
And that is why I'm going
to fight him to the death on this.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.462
You know, he may have his money
and his... his big-city lawyers,

17:18.537 --> 17:21.904
but I have the sword of justice
on my side.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.470
Jerky?

17:24.742 --> 17:29.407
No. No, thank you. Al, this doesn't
have to end up in the courts.

17:29.481 --> 17:32.609
I mean, you and Tim
just have to come to your senses.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.413
Tim?

17:34.486 --> 17:38.445
The man who has federal marshals
hounding me about some mail fraud rap?

17:39.992 --> 17:44.361
Well, we all know that Tim
has a tendency to go overboard.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.988
Yeah. Well, when he goes
overboard with me...

17:47.066 --> 17:51.628
...he turns the whole ship upside-down.
And I'm left holding onto my dinghy.

17:58.277 --> 18:01.906
Well, it's just... you know,
he... he takes advantage of me.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.811
- I know.
- It makes me so mad!

18:03.882 --> 18:07.648
- I just... I sink to his level!
- OK. What do you mean by that?

18:07.719 --> 18:09.584
Well, I...

18:09.655 --> 18:12.522
First, Tim makes me sign
this ridiculous lease.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.560
And then when I ask him
to abide by the lease

18:15.627 --> 18:18.289
and fix some things
around the house, he resists.

18:18.363 --> 18:22.265
And that... you know, I retaliate by...
by finding more things for him to fix.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.303
- Well, that's understandable.
- It gets worse than that.

18:25.370 --> 18:30.137
Because once he fixed everything, I... I
started breaking new things on purpose.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.076
- You broke things?
- Yeah.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.545
That's sick.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.074
It's also really, really funny.

18:40.919 --> 18:44.184
You know, I've done similar things
to him for different reasons.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.723
- You have?
- This one time,

18:45.791 --> 18:48.487
I was really overwhelmed
with schoolwork.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.791
He kept pestering me about
remodeling a bathroom or something.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.731
So, I snuck out to the garage and...

18:54.800 --> 18:59.169
...I... I squirted some motor oil
under the engine of his Mustang.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.432
It kept him out of my hair for days.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.068
That's brilliant!

19:04.176 --> 19:08.010
This other time,
I painted chicken pox on Mark's face

19:08.080 --> 19:10.708
so I wouldn't have to go
to a tractor pull.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.677
This is a side of you
I never knew existed!

19:14.786 --> 19:17.812
- Yeah. I'm devious.
- Yeah, you are. You're very devious.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.757
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.628
You guys are laughing over this lease?

19:27.699 --> 19:31.191
<i>I've been giving a lot of thought
about this landlordltenant thing.</i>

19:31.270 --> 19:33.602
And we gotta work this out.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.334
- You think so?
- Yeah. I don't want you out...

19:36.408 --> 19:38.968
Well, you guys obviously have to talk.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.238
- No, we don't. I was done. I'm done.
- Bye!

19:41.346 --> 19:43.576
- That was it. I don't have to talk.
- Oh, no, no.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.584
She's right. We have
some issues we have to discuss.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.580
I say we just let bygones be bygones
and start over.

19:50.656 --> 19:51.884
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.585
It goes much deeper
than that, you know?

19:54.660 --> 19:57.288
This affects the very fabric
of our relationship.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.525
This is like talking to Jill
with a beard.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.693
Now, Tim, I... You know,
I have some things to admit.

20:05.771 --> 20:09.935
I have been childish and petty and
unreasonable throughout all of this.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.635
- I have a confession.
- Good.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.200
You're absolutely right.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.107
Well, obviously, you're not ready
to talk about these things.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.812
Well, what the hey, you know?
You made the gesture and came over here.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.515
And I admitted
I was petty and childish.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.957
And you made the gesture
and came over here. And...

20:28.026 --> 20:31.189
- And see you, Al.
- Apology accepted.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.694
Uh, the truth is, Al, you know me.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.462
When I start something new,
I tend to go a little crazy.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.970
It always affects the people
closest to me first.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.370
And the truth is
you're a responsible guy.

20:42.441 --> 20:48.004
And you can... you can live here
without the lease.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.310
- Uh...
- Al, don't say another word.

20:50.382 --> 20:54.284
Without the lease. Forget about it. The
lease is gone. Bye-bye. See you later.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.583
Well, thank you, Tim.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.356
That was actually
my life insurance policy.

21:06.698 --> 21:09.929
Well, here it is. The new shirt.

21:14.906 --> 21:19.434
Congratulations, Brad. I... I know
I have never seen anything like that.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.303
Now, you're not gonna go out
and buy one of these.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.442
Oh, you actually paid money for that?

21:27.219 --> 21:30.120
Looks like you peeled it off
a dead clown.

21:32.557 --> 21:35.253
Look who I brought home
for dinner, everybody.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.158
- Ah!
- Hi, Jill. Hey, Mark.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.959
- Hey, Al.
- Ooh, nice shirt.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.132
- You like it? I just got it.
- Yeah. Well, me too!

21:48.340 --> 21:50.308
All right!

21:52.511 --> 21:54.809
Forget about it.
You don't need this lease.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.008
No, no, no, no, no...

22:00.719 --> 22:02.880
There we go. OK.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.458
He may have his money
and his big-city lawyers,

22:11.530 --> 22:14.590
but I have the sword
of justice in my side.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.226
- Is it in your side?
- It's right here.
