00:01.000 --> 00:02.126
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.200 --> 00:03.680
Prostitutes,
left-handed killer,

00:03.760 --> 00:05.171
organs being surgically removed.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.446
This is starting to
sound a little familiar.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.000
You're thinking Jack the Ripper?

00:10.320 --> 00:11.401
Oh, my God.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.681
What happened to the trailer?

00:12.760 --> 00:14.125
Juliette.
She torched it.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.930
Juliette knows
just about everything

00:17.120 --> 00:18.724
about Mr. Burkhardt,
about his mother,

00:18.960 --> 00:21.327
and therefore, about where
the child might be.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.125
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if Nick was in mortal danger

00:24.280 --> 00:25.520
and needed mummy's help?

00:25.640 --> 00:28.371
There is a way to
suppress the Hexenbiest in her.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.930
Wouldn't that
mean you'd have to try it

00:30.040 --> 00:31.520
on a Hexenbiest to
make sure it works?

00:32.280 --> 00:33.805
No,
Juliette, it's all we've got!

00:36.120 --> 00:38.088
When are you all gonna learn
that I like who I am?

00:38.240 --> 00:39.446
Well, we don't.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.290
Well, that's just too damn bad.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.766
Nick.
Oh, my God.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.171
I can't stop it!

00:49.520 --> 00:52.569
"Stronger than lover's love
is lover's hate.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.008
Incurable, in each,
the wounds they make."

00:57.800 --> 00:58.926
What are you doing?
I can't stop it!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.126
Go, go!

01:02.360 --> 01:03.646
Nick!
I can't stop it!

01:03.800 --> 01:05.165
Let go of the gun!

01:10.640 --> 01:12.005
That was close.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.561
So, if you really did test your
little concoction on Miss Adalind,

01:16.680 --> 01:18.762
and she is useless,

01:19.080 --> 01:22.687
then I suppose you did
me a great big favor.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.165
Thanks for doing
the heavy lifting.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.565
Oh, my God!

01:32.840 --> 01:36.208
Whoever that was,
lam done trying to help it.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.606
Me, too.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.760
She could've killed Monroe!

01:38.800 --> 01:39.801
I'm out, too.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.331
That bitch!

01:41.560 --> 01:44.530
Juliette's out of control.
We need to warn the Captain.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.006
Hello.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.681
Who is this?

01:53.800 --> 01:54.881
Well, you called me.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.371
Who is this?

01:56.440 --> 01:57.726
I'm looking for Sean Renard.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.724
You don't have him,
but this is his phone.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.725
Where is he?
We're home.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.771
But I'm afraid he can't come
to the phone right now.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.565
He's resting.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.564
We had a bit of a rough night.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.202
This last one was a real fighter.
We're quite fatigued.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.927
So, if it's not a bother, call
back at a more convenient time.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.486
Cheers.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.686
Who the hell was that?

02:20.800 --> 02:22.480
I think we just heard
from Jack the Ripper.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.641
Wait a minute, he's with Renard?

02:23.760 --> 02:24.841
Yeah.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.524
I'll have Wu meet us.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.481
When did you get here?
Just now.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.761
You see anything?
Nothing.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
Where do you want me?

02:45.960 --> 02:46.961
Take the back.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.004
Hey! What...
Stay there!

03:31.120 --> 03:32.565
What the hell is...
Shh.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.690
What the hell?
I don't know.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.080
You called the Captain's cell.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.366
The guy said he was here.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.045
You heard him.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.249
Where's your cell phone?
Why?

03:50.320 --> 03:52.400
I called your cell, somebody
answered, it wasn't you.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.560
What are you talking about?

03:53.640 --> 03:54.721
Where's your cell phone?
It's not here.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.530
I don't know,
maybe in the living room.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.047
Somebody want to tell me what's going on?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.161
Check the calls.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.770
Last call was received
at 10:08. Your number.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.889
Well, I didn't talk to you, Nick.
I must've missed the call.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.769
Where were you 15 minutes ago?
I was sleeping.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.079
You leave that door open?

04:19.160 --> 04:20.160
No.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.201
It was open, sir.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.765
I talked to somebody
on your phone that said

04:22.840 --> 04:24.330
you were at home
and you were resting.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.890
Are you saying
the killer was in my house?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.120
That's what he said, and he
was talking on your phone.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.080
Where were you tonight
before you came home?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.251
I was at Henrietta's. What does
that have to do with anything?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.800
You might wanna
get dressed, Captain.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.925
Henrietta?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.361
Henrietta!

04:44.200 --> 04:47.761
God, no. God, no. God! No, no!

04:49.200 --> 04:50.486
We got a body.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.568
1118 Old Stable Drive,
off Williams Road.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.122
Copy that.
1118 Old Stable Drive.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.880
He said, "We."

05:22.000 --> 05:23.161
Who?

05:23.320 --> 05:24.560
The guy you
talked to on the phone.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.211
He said, "We had a rough night.
She was a real fighter."

05:27.960 --> 05:29.291
Yeah, he did.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.130
Doesn't "we"
imply more than one?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.770
Let's figure this out. We need
to figure out who "we" is.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.803
This guy is targeting me,
I don't know why.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.847
He must have seen
the press conference,

05:38.920 --> 05:40.365
but he was probably
waiting outside my house,

05:40.440 --> 05:42.761
followed me here, killed her,
then came back after me.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.366
It's a good thing you called, when you
did, you probably scared him off.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.761
Let's get you home. Let us
handle the investigation.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.530
You're dealing
with enough right now.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.485
Yeah, okay.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.968
You just have to find this killer, all
right. Whatever you need, get it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.203
We're taking the Captain home.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.920
We want surveillance
on his house all night.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.925
Yeah, I'll put someone on it.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.680
Position one, secure.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.200
Position two, secure.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.889
Position three, secure.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.965
Home sweet home.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.767
He took down all
our photographs.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.530
Painful memories.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.442
How many ways in and out?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.326
Front door,
side door, back door.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.402
Back door's in the kitchen.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.883
This must be the computer you
used to email his mother.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.121
Yes.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.726
Weston Steward had his head cut
off here, Sean was shot here,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.045
such a happy home.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.202
Good place to raise a family.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.847
Anything else I
should be aware of?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.641
Ah!

08:13.040 --> 08:14.371
Not really.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.320
And what's upstairs?

08:16.440 --> 08:17.771
Two bedrooms, two baths.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.087
Let's have a look.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.890
And this was our bedroom.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.248
And this would be where Nick
and Adalind made their baby.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.125
It would.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.447
Anything else?

08:48.600 --> 08:49.681
Yes.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.241
If I'm gonna be working
with the Royal Family,

08:55.600 --> 08:58.809
you need to have
a very clear understanding

09:00.880 --> 09:03.565
of just how valuable I can be.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.485
It's secure.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.560
Why were you at Henrietta's?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.522
I've been having
some problems lately.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.324
What kind of problems?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.405
I keep dreaming that
I'm getting shot again.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.160
It's been
happening over and over.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.006
The scars on my chest,
they start to bleed,

09:31.120 --> 09:33.487
almost as though I
did just get shot.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.161
Have you seen a doctor?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.847
Yeah, they can't find
anything wrong with me.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.890
I've been waking up in places and
I don't know how I got there.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.161
So you're blacking out.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.761
I don't know, that's why
I went to see Henrietta.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.640
I was hoping she could tell me
what was wrong.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.045
What did she tell you?
Nothing.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.651
It was a waste. So I left.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.760
Look, I don't know,
maybe this killer

09:54.800 --> 09:56.480
is trying to make me
think I'm going crazy,

09:56.920 --> 09:58.365
or what if he's gonna
pin this murder on me?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.845
Or what if,
what if he's drugging me?

09:59.920 --> 10:02.651
Look, Captain, the best thing you
can do right now is get some sleep.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.728
Got an officer outside,
he'll stay here all night.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.966
Put your alarm on
and keep your phone with you.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.165
Okay.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.086
Okay.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.642
If he's blacking out,
anything could happen.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.000
Do we really think this Jack guy

10:23.040 --> 10:24.280
is following him, drugging him?

10:24.320 --> 10:26.040
I don't know,
something doesn't sound right.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.726
Is it possible this thing
is controlling him somehow?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.201
What if it's in him?

10:38.560 --> 10:40.403
Hey, fellas,
what am I looking for?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.927
Anybody shows up outside this
house, we wanna know about it.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.247
Anyone comes out of the house,
we want to know about that, too.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.600
Somebody after
the Captain again?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.806
Maybe.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.800
We don't know yet.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.484
Adalind.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.041
Nick, what's up?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.281
Adalind would know.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.691
She would know what?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.131
What's going on
with the Captain.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.526
All right.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.242
What the hell is going on?

12:58.760 --> 13:01.809
You've been a bad boy, Sean.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.361
And it's only gonna get worse.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.480
Hello?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.840
Bud, it's Nick,
we need to talk to Ada/ind.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.726
What's wrong? She's asleep,
do you want me to wake her up?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.490
No, let me do it.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.280
Okay, how long will it
take you to get here?

13:42.520 --> 13:44.124
There's somebody at the door!
What should I do?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.401
Bud, it's us.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.083
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.766
What's wrong, what's
happening, are we in trouble?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.883
No, Bud, everything's good.
Where's Adalind?

13:58.600 --> 14:01.285
Uh, first bedroom
on the right, down the hall.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.205
Man, I'm out of breath.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.601
Are you getting enough sleep?

14:05.960 --> 14:07.041
Sleep?

14:07.400 --> 14:08.560
Yeah, yeah, sure, no problem.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.925
No, not really.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.610
I don't know how you guys do it,

14:14.720 --> 14:16.360
living with all this
tension all the time.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.246
For one thing,
we don't use bats.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.449
What happened with Juliette?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.402
She drank it, didn't she?

14:29.680 --> 14:30.886
It worked.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.850
I saved her, and now you're
here to get rid of me.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.241
Adalind, I'm not gonna hurt you.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.920
Why not?

14:38.080 --> 14:39.080
If she's better, then...

14:39.120 --> 14:40.201
It didn't work.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.646
What?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.206
It had to, it worked on me,
I can't do anything anymore.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.651
She didn't drink it.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.046
Well, no wonder it didn't work.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.121
You gotta get her to drink it.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.281
She destroyed it.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.481
Why?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.765
Isn't this what she wanted?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.245
Not anymore.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.010
I don't understand.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.531
She likes what she is.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.364
She likes the power.
She's not going to give it up.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.361
Oh...

15:08.960 --> 15:10.400
So that's what you
wanted to tell me.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.646
That and there's
another problem.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.962
There's something
wrong with Renard.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.244
He keeps dreaming
about being shot

15:19.320 --> 15:21.288
and when he wakes up
his scars are bleeding.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.010
As if the bullets
had just gone into him?

15:23.160 --> 15:24.810
Yes.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.521
Is he having blackouts?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.331
Yeah. He's waking
up in strange places.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.805
He can't remember
how he got there.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.406
Did he die?

15:32.520 --> 15:33.806
What do you mean?

15:33.920 --> 15:37.322
When he was shot, at the hospital,
was he ever pronounced dead?

15:37.560 --> 15:40.484
I don't know. I know they
didn't expect him to survive.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.245
Was anybody there with him?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.326
Well, his mother.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.844
Then he did die,
and she brought him back.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.440
That must have been
what opened the portal.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.760
What are you talking about?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.889
When he died, Sean was
dead just long enough

15:56.960 --> 15:58.007
for something to hitch a ride.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.082
And when his
mother brought him back,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.248
Sean brought that
something back with him.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.889
That's why he's bleeding.
It's taking control.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.925
Does he know?

16:08.640 --> 16:09.920
He knows there's
something wrong,

16:09.960 --> 16:11.200
but he can't remember anything.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.002
That's good, because when
he does, it'll be too late.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.241
Too late for what?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.530
Whatever he brought back with
him will have taken over.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.884
Spirit possession,
that's how that happens.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.800
So how do we get it out of him?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.846
You can't. Unless you
open the portal again.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.446
How do we do that?

16:29.560 --> 16:30.766
You have to kill him.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.447
If we kill him,
he's kinda dead, isn't he?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.680
We were thinking maybe
there's a way to do this.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.331
Like the Dead Faint,

16:37.400 --> 16:40.165
the same one we used on Monroe when
they hired Angelina to kill him.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.683
The only way to
prove she had done it

16:42.800 --> 16:44.723
was to show them his dead body.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.004
The tetrodotoxin,

16:47.080 --> 16:50.243
it slows down bodily functions,
but it's very dangerous.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.051
I'll say. it almost killed me.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.651
Well, if we don't figure out
a way to get rid of it,

16:54.720 --> 16:55.800
we will end up killing him.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.008
Are you sure he's
involved in all this?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.128
'Cause I'd like to be real sure
before we do it.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.807
We haven't been able to tie
him to the crime scenes yet.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.450
We're going back to re-check
surveillance footage,

17:04.520 --> 17:06.204
see if there's
something that we missed.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.731
Burkhardt.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.204
Okay, good. Stay with him.
We're on our way.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.925
That was Officer Franco.
Captain's on his way in.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.122
We'll start working on it.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.486
There's nothing in this one.
Maybe we missed it.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.921
Maybe we're wrong.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.490
Maybe we're just too damn tired.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.566
What do we got left?

17:52.280 --> 17:55.284
Bank footage on Alder,
I'm looking at it now.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.881
There's more footage from West Burnside.
I'll pull it up.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.049
All these cars are starting
to look the same to me.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.929
Wait. I got something.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.806
Is that the Captain's?

18:11.640 --> 18:12.971
It's him.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.804
It puts him in the area within
one hour of the first killing.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.201
He's here.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.611
I need to see you both, now.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.920
Hold on.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.605
Before we go in there,

18:32.760 --> 18:35.684
if he's dealing with what
we think he's dealing with,

18:35.800 --> 18:37.802
who the hell are we
gonna be talking to?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Or what?

18:39.040 --> 18:41.361
Okay, that didn't help at all.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.682
There's something
very wrong with me.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.044
I'm starting to
think I'm losing my mind.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.566
What happened?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.360
Last night, I thought
I was bleeding again.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.366
I saw it,
I felt it, it was real.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.571
And I remember falling.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.680
Then I woke up, and I was in
bed, as though nothing happened.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.281
And there was a voice,
I heard this voice.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.525
I don't know.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.130
You blacked out again?

19:20.680 --> 19:22.170
I guess I did.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.643
Do you remember driving around
11:30 three nights ago?

19:28.840 --> 19:30.251
What? Why?

19:30.360 --> 19:32.681
We have some surveillance that
puts your car on Northwest Couch,

19:32.760 --> 19:34.125
and Second, about that time.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.323
It wasn't me.
I was at home, asleep.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.960
Well, your car was
a couple blocks away

19:40.000 --> 19:42.526
from where the first victim's
body was found the same night.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.524
Within an hour of the
estimated time of death.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.080
No. No, no, no, no.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.003
No, I would remember
something like that.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.287
During a blackout?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.480
I would remember something!

19:51.600 --> 19:52.647
We talked to Adalind.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.969
She said that when you died,
a portal opened up,

19:56.280 --> 19:58.965
and when your mother did whatever
she did to bring you back,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.361
you didn't come alone.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.642
Are you saying
that I'm possessed?

20:07.360 --> 20:10.807
You're blacking out, waking up
in places you don't remember,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.280
bleeding from
where you were shot.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.680
You know you went
to see Henrietta,

20:13.800 --> 20:15.040
but you have no
idea when you left.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.884
Are you suggesting
that I killed those women?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.325
We're suggesting
you may no longer

20:18.440 --> 20:19.800
be in control of
what you're doing.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.246
And if that's true, what
should I do, lock myself up?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.040
Monroe and Rosalee
are working on something.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.370
But until we figure it out, it may be
a good idea for you to stay at home.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.680
Under surveillance.
No, no, no, no, no!

20:30.760 --> 20:32.762
I want to know what the
hell is happening to me!

20:33.800 --> 20:36.406
You need to give us
your gun, Captain.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.371
All right.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.321
Okay.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.487
But you have to know, whatever
happened, it wasn't me.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.891
I want someone watching me
who understands.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.367
You think there's some kind of
Jack the Ripper spirit inside him?

21:22.440 --> 21:23.960
Pretty sure.
Except we can't arrest him

21:24.000 --> 21:25.960
without having to explain it.
Yeah, don't do that.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.161
So, basically,
he's under house arrest.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.327
Unofficially.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.767
And he's okay with that?

21:30.840 --> 21:31.841
For now.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.891
What about this
other guy inside him?

21:35.160 --> 21:36.366
Is he okay with that?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.160
Just don't let either
of them go anywhere.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.046
Anything happens, call us.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.690
We'll be leaving in
a couple of hours.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.322
Well, this should
be a jolly good romp.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.085
To be honest, sir, I didn't
really think she'd go this far.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.846
I'm not certain there's a
limit to what she'll do.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.171
Sorry to put you through this.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.611
Don't worry about it, Captain.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.451
Nick,
Captain's inside his house.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.051
Thanks, Wu.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.963
As soon as we're done here,
we're coming over.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.768
Captain's in. So far, so good.

22:58.840 --> 22:59.966
Okay.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.488
The Dead Faint is done.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.971
I think it'll work, but Sean
can't know what he's taking.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.890
We have to assume whatever
Sean knows, Jack knows.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.360
Right.
I mean, the dilemma here is,

23:11.480 --> 23:13.960
if that thing inside him knows
he's not really dying,

23:14.080 --> 23:15.840
then he's probably
not gonna cross back over.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.760
I think they both have to
believe they're dying.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.764
What if the Captain thought
he was taking something

23:19.840 --> 23:22.241
that would help him remember what
he was doing during the blackouts?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.482
Some kind of memory reboot.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.601
There's something called Gedachtnishilfe,
which sort of does that.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.524
Well, so we tell him
that's what we're giving him.

23:30.640 --> 23:34.008
It's pretty tame stuff, it wouldn't
kill him. And he might know that.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.084
I think we have to do something

23:36.200 --> 23:37.884
that makes it look
like he's really dying.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.686
We have to convince Jack that this is
the end, and it's time to move out.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.841
Hit the road, Jack.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.720
Falling asleep might not
be enough to do that.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.002
We're gonna have
to put on a show.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.605
We may just have to shoot him.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.569
No, it's not right.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.125
I would have
remembered something!

23:57.240 --> 24:00.005
The place. If it was cold,
if it was raining.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.163
Her screams. You never
forget something like that.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.884
Oh, God, no. No.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.045
No, no, no! No!

24:14.840 --> 24:16.490
No. Stop. Stop.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.006
Stop! Stop!

24:51.760 --> 24:53.171
He's inside!

24:54.400 --> 24:56.323
He's inside!
Inside where?

24:59.160 --> 25:00.241
Inside here.

25:04.080 --> 25:08.881
Now, what say you and I
have a bloody good time.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.481
Got something.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.326
Is that Kelly Burkhardt?

25:24.120 --> 25:25.167
I can't tell.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.561
What's going on?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.366
Juliette.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.329
Who's this?
This is my mom.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.485
Your mom. Kelly?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.601
What?

26:03.200 --> 26:04.725
Someone's on the front porch.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.566
Is it her?

26:06.680 --> 26:08.011
Don't know yet.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.366
There's no child.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.771
Want us to make a move?

26:12.600 --> 26:13.886
We have to be sure.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.050
It's not her.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.486
Who is it?

26:23.920 --> 26:24.967
Just some kid.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.730
You're probably asking yourself,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.520
how on Earth did this
bloke learn to drive?

26:49.560 --> 26:51.369
No, Captain.
You gotta stop this.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.410
He'd love to stop it, but I
have other plans for him.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.087
Please. Please, listen to me!

26:57.160 --> 26:58.491
God, it's good to be alive!

26:58.600 --> 26:59.931
Please, please listen to me.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.764
Listen to me.
Best hold on, mate.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.170
Where the hell is Wu?

27:15.040 --> 27:16.929
Gun. Wu's gun.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.211
I don't think it's been fired.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.641
I need a track.
Patrol car 421.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.084
As I set out from
London town Upon a foggy day

27:28.240 --> 27:31.244
I came across a fair young
maid And stole her heart away!

27:31.720 --> 27:34.849
But not the way you think it
done I did not use me charm

27:35.840 --> 27:37.763
Instead, I used a blade so sharp

27:38.200 --> 27:39.770
Bloody hell.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.170
She could not raise alarm!

27:42.240 --> 27:43.446
All together now!

27:43.520 --> 27:45.488
As I set out from London town...

27:49.240 --> 27:50.241
Where the hell are they?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.447
Nick.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.291
Let's go.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.922
I hope you don't fancy
the blonde because I do.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.046
I tell you what. I'll bring a
piece of her back for you.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.282
No, no, no.
Please, Captain, don't.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.521
This is not you.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.000
There's something inside you...
Hey!

28:21.080 --> 28:23.321
Come on, we're here to
have fun, don't ruin it.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.442
I'd hate to have to
cut out your tongue.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.961
Because I wouldn't do
it through your mouth.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.286
I might get bit, after all.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.690
Now, watch and learn.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.721
No, no, no, no, no. Don't.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.523
No. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.246
Nice night?

28:57.400 --> 28:58.925
For a lot of things.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.686
Griffin.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.531
We'll take it.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.927
They got Wu's car.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.967
No. No. No!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.247
No!

29:10.800 --> 29:12.006
Oh, God.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.767
No! No!

30:19.400 --> 30:20.481
Come on!

30:28.960 --> 30:30.689
This is far enough.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.001
You wanna play right here?

30:32.120 --> 30:33.201
I do.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.640
God.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.724
So we need to talk about price.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.971
Now, I'm sure
you're worth every penny.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.645
Aren't you a pretty one.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.010
Wu!
Where's the Captain?

30:51.080 --> 30:52.241
He got another woman!

30:52.520 --> 30:54.280
He's got another woman.
He's down the street!

30:54.320 --> 30:55.446
This guy is crazy.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.962
He's not the Captain, you
were right, he's possessed!

30:58.040 --> 30:59.769
He's gonna kill her!

31:08.840 --> 31:10.444
I love your hair.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.531
Smells so good.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.684
Kissing's extra, honey.

31:16.760 --> 31:20.128
Now, now, darling,
there won't be any kissing.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.490
What's going on?
I wasn't doing anything.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.930
Get out of here.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.729
What's going on?
What are you doing?

31:39.080 --> 31:42.084
Nick? How did I get here?

31:42.960 --> 31:44.962
What happened?

31:47.880 --> 31:49.723
You got it?
We're ready.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.805
What are you giving me?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.640
You said you can't
remember what happened.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.284
This is gonna help you
remember what happened.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.681
I took it once and went to
sleep, woke up feeling fine.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.685
Remembered everything.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.650
What if I remember
killing those women?

32:07.520 --> 32:08.681
We know it wasn't you.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.042
But we have to know
what we're dealing with.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.841
Okay.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.965
This is just in case, sir.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.408
Maybe it's best I do remember.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.085
So what now?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.165
We wait.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.884
You might wanna lie down.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.964
Kelly.
Juliette.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.762
Is everything okay?

34:10.159 --> 34:11.366
Thank God you're here.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.284
Nick's not home, but I am,
and the front door's unlocked.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.850
It's her, Kelly Burkhardt.
She's got the kid.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.571
Juliette?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.725
Let's take this outside.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.051
Thank God.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.761
Diana.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.444
Hey.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.765
We got her!

36:41.800 --> 36:43.290
And we've got her.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.485
I'm getting sleepy.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.402
Is that supposed to happen?

37:00.360 --> 37:02.169
I'm not remembering anything.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.687
If you feel like you're going
to fall asleep, that's fine.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.765
Just means it's working.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.202
Yeah, I'm just so tired.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.084
It's working.
Yeah.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.004
Let me check his pulse.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.329
His pulse is slowing down,
we'll only have a few seconds.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.529
Getting slower, slower.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.081
Almost.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.321
No!

37:36.440 --> 37:38.480
One step closer and
I'll snap her pretty neck.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.004
Trying to kill me, is that it?

37:43.120 --> 37:44.610
Nick, shoot him!
It's still the Captain.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.761
Shoot him!
We've got to do it, Nick.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.604
We've got to take him down!
We don't have a choice, Nick!

37:47.680 --> 37:49.569
You shoot me, we both die.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.760
Don't want that, now, do we?

37:50.920 --> 37:52.081
YOU got 1:0 kill him, Nick!

37:52.160 --> 37:53.286
It's the Captain!

37:53.400 --> 37:54.526
Now! He's strangling her!

37:54.600 --> 37:56.170
Tell me what you gave to him!

37:57.480 --> 37:58.481
Ah!

38:06.160 --> 38:07.969
Oh, my God, you okay?

38:08.080 --> 38:09.650
- Let me see.
- I hope Jack bought it.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.529
He may not be dead, but he's
not gonna be feeling too good

38:11.640 --> 38:13.085
after that many rubber bullets.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.411
How much longer
do we have to wait?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.561
Not very.

38:16.720 --> 38:17.767
Okay, just make sure he's dead.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.206
I'm not getting a pulse.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.722
Was that it?
Whoa. No! Wait.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.801
What if Jack's not gone?

38:23.880 --> 38:25.245
Then shoot him for real.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.082
I hope this hurts.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.286
He's not coming back.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.407
He might need CPR.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.691
Captain?

39:07.920 --> 39:09.445
Yeah?

39:11.400 --> 39:13.050
It's really you?

39:15.760 --> 39:17.762
What happened?

39:17.880 --> 39:19.245
Feel like I got hit by a truck.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.490
What do you remember?

39:30.080 --> 39:31.241
God!

39:31.320 --> 39:32.810
I remember...

39:34.160 --> 39:37.448
I remember coming here
and you gave me something.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.962
Yeah, to help you remember.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.482
I don't think it worked.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.204
Oh, God, no.
I can't be bleeding again.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.046
What did you do to me?

40:01.160 --> 40:03.288
- I think we cured you.
- Jack's gone.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.965
What now?

40:11.760 --> 40:14.081
Hey!
I can't believe you got here.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.087
Trubel?

40:18.440 --> 40:20.249
Nick, there's a lot of
people at your house.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.049
Something big is going on there,
I just killed a Hundjager.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.360
We got to go. Now!

40:35.320 --> 40:37.846
All in all, I'd say this has
been a rather good night.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.364
Where's my mommy?

41:02.920 --> 41:04.251
Nick.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.050
Clear upstairs.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.446
Nick.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.446
No!

42:00.520 --> 42:01.567
No!

42:13.560 --> 42:15.130
No!

42:15.800 --> 42:17.450
No!

42:18.120 --> 42:19.645
No!
