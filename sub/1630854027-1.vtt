<i>All of us have demons.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:29.174
-All I want is a
relationship with my daughter.

00:29.273 --> 00:32.141
-He's an alcoholic and so were you.

00:33.775 --> 00:35.541
<i>You face them.</i>

00:35.574 --> 00:38.176

00:38.209 --> 00:39.776
<i>it turns out.</i>

00:39.809 --> 00:42.408
<i>they weren't your demons to begin with.</i>

00:42.509 --> 00:44.077
What the fuck?

00:44.177 --> 00:45.744
-Oh, fu--

00:45.843 --> 00:46.543
-Vance!

00:46.643 --> 00:47.778
It's not what you think.

00:47.844 --> 00:49.377
You're getting married tomorrow!

00:49.511 --> 00:52.044
-I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want.

00:52.111 --> 00:53.079
-Tell me what?

00:53.212 --> 00:55.912
-Hardin is Christian's son.

00:56.746 --> 00:57.946
- I'm so sorry.
- Fuck off!

I'll get one of those.

02:53.301 --> 02:54.402
Your dad.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.402
Ken.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.171
You know, we were like brothers.

03:02.271 --> 03:03.905
-And then you fucked his wife.

03:03.971 --> 03:05.337
-That's not how it was.

03:07.205 --> 03:09.106
I loved your mum.

03:09.206 --> 03:10.606
She was head over heels with him.

03:12.505 --> 03:16.373
But then when he went to
university, he wasn't there.

03:16.473 --> 03:18.339
He was wandering around.
He was always busy.

03:18.473 --> 03:23.507
And. she turned to me
for emotional support.

03:26.109 --> 03:27.609
That's how it became intimate.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.010
- Spare me the fucking details, okay?

03:31.110 --> 03:35.044
-I had this ridiculous notion
that we'd run off together and.

03:37.144 --> 03:41.078
she'd marry me instead of Ken.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.913
Then they announced they were expecting.

03:43.979 --> 03:46.613
And that was that.

03:49.947 --> 03:51.446
-This is just brilliant.

03:53.714 --> 03:57.347
And Mum, Ken and you lying
to me my entire fucking life.

03:59.049 --> 04:00.515
-Ken didn't know.

04:04.515 --> 04:06.651
I think deep down he's
always suspected her.

04:08.584 --> 04:11.051
That was when he really started drinking.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.418
-You could have stopped all of it.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.586
My entire fucking life
could have been different

04:17.653 --> 04:19.619
if you weren't such a fucking coward.

04:27.588 --> 04:32.454
-Smith, you can go dance with them. Go on.

04:32.589 --> 04:34.789
-Does he know that Hardin is his brother?

04:47.725 --> 04:48.792
Where's Hardin?

04:49.193 --> 04:50.560
-I don't know. He bolted.

04:51.259 --> 04:52.092
-What?

04:52.193 --> 04:53.827
-Maybe he needed some space.

04:55.093 --> 04:56.393
Wait, Tessa.

05:38.902 --> 05:40.902
<i> Oh, Christian, you should see him.</i>

05:40.936 --> 05:42.703
<i>He's growing up so fast.</i>

05:42.736 --> 05:46.237
<i>He's a little man now.</i>

05:46.270 --> 05:47.336
<i>And so talented.</i>

05:47.436 --> 05:50.271
His essay got chosen to run in a paper.

05:50.305 --> 05:51.638
<i>Well done, Hardin.</i>

05:51.672 --> 05:53.505
<i>Can you tell him I said that?</i>

05:53.638 --> 05:54.972
He's brilliant.

05:56.338 --> 05:57.840
He's like his father.

05:57.973 --> 06:01.339
Look, I gotta get going.
Um, let's talk again soon.

06:01.372 --> 06:02.406
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

06:02.507 --> 06:03.307
Bye, Christian.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.941
-Hey, keep it down.

06:12.209 --> 06:12.976
Ken!

06:14.309 --> 06:16.909
-Hardin, who gave this to you?

06:16.976 --> 06:17.910
-Vance.

06:24.212 --> 06:25.644
-Ken! Ken!
-Stop! You're ruining it!

06:25.778 --> 06:26.778
Hardin!

06:31.079 --> 06:32.446
I'm so sorry.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.813
<i> Hardin?</i>

06:40.681 --> 06:42.248
I've been looking for you.

06:45.416 --> 06:46.782
-Wanna drink?

06:46.882 --> 06:48.381
-No.

06:52.584 --> 06:54.218
Come on, let's go back to the hotel.

06:54.317 --> 06:56.585
-Not yet.

06:56.718 --> 06:58.284
Okay. Please, Hardin,

06:58.418 --> 07:01.285
I'm really cold and tired.
And I just wanna go back--

07:01.351 --> 07:02.519
-Tessa, you're not the one
who just found out

07:02.619 --> 07:03.786
his entire life was a lie.

07:03.919 --> 07:06.086
So, either
have a drink with me or go.

07:12.487 --> 07:13.988
-Okay.
I'm gonna get us an Uber.

07:20.156 --> 07:21.355
You know, I'm pretty sure

07:21.456 --> 07:23.923
that she would have
locked it before she left.

07:26.090 --> 07:27.123
Hey!

07:41.126 --> 07:42.760
-Hardin, please.
I know you're upset,

07:42.827 --> 07:44.493
and I know you're angry.
And you should--

07:44.594 --> 07:45.760
-You know,
I hear her screams

07:45.827 --> 07:47.895
every single time
I walk in this place.

07:47.994 --> 07:48.695
Okay, we need to leave.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.095
-Years I've spent hating a man

07:50.229 --> 07:52.629
who as it turns out, I didn't
even need to fucking like!

07:53.028 --> 07:54.163
Don't touch me.

07:54.395 --> 07:55.529
What's the plan?
What are you gonna do here?

07:55.662 --> 07:56.829
Are you gonna burn
your mother's house down?

07:56.929 --> 07:58.430
-I'm gonna burn
the fucking place down, yeah.

07:58.530 --> 07:59.496
-So, you're gonna get arrested,
you know that? Right?

07:59.563 --> 08:00.830
-Which is why you should leave.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.865
-No! I'm not--
I'm not going without you.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.464
-Tess.

08:05.564 --> 08:06.632
"If two people love each other,

08:06.731 --> 08:07.699
there can be
no happy end to it."

08:07.765 --> 08:09.699
-Don't quote
Hemingway at me.

08:09.765 --> 08:10.732
-Why are you always
trying to find

08:10.866 --> 08:11.999
some sort of light in me,
Tessa?

08:12.132 --> 08:14.133
Wake up.
There is no fucking light.

08:14.233 --> 08:15.733
I have fucked up parents,

08:15.800 --> 08:16.833
fucked up past.
-Look at my parents!

08:16.867 --> 08:18.434
-So, I have a fucked up head
now!

08:18.467 --> 08:19.701
-My Dad's homeless,
for God's sake.

08:19.734 --> 08:21.701
-It's not a fucking competition!

08:32.003 --> 08:33.703
Hardin, please,
give me the lighter.

08:39.005 --> 08:41.005
Please, Hardin, can you think
about what you're doing?

09:00.909 --> 09:01.809
-Hardin?

09:01.942 --> 09:02.676
Oh, my God.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.209
Hardin, we gotta get out here.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.643
-Get the fuck off me!

09:05.743 --> 09:06.643
-We need to go!

09:06.776 --> 09:08.311
All right, Tessa,
you take my car.

09:08.444 --> 09:10.044
-I can't.
-Yes, you can. I've got him.

09:10.144 --> 09:12.078
Come on, man, we need to go.
-Now, you wanna play hero?

09:12.178 --> 09:13.346
Where were you?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.012
Where were you
when she was being beaten

09:15.145 --> 09:16.479
to a bloody fucking pulp?

09:16.579 --> 09:17.912
Fuck away from me!

09:19.080 --> 09:21.013
You're too late!

09:21.080 --> 09:22.180
-I'm sorry, all right?

09:22.280 --> 09:23.847
-I don't care.
-I'm sorry!

09:23.914 --> 09:24.881
Come here.

09:25.014 --> 09:27.881
I am sorry.
I should have been here for her.

09:27.947 --> 09:29.848
Listen to me!

09:29.948 --> 09:31.748
I should have been here.

09:31.882 --> 09:34.782
But you ruining your life
isn't gonna make hers better.

09:38.483 --> 09:40.117
We need to go!

09:40.251 --> 09:42.150
Come on!
Get out, now!

09:46.851 --> 09:47.985
Go, go!

09:51.354 --> 09:52.820
Go.

10:14.857 --> 10:16.292
<i>Dispatches unit.</i>

10:50.530 --> 10:51.597
-Where are we?

10:51.731 --> 10:53.398
-I don't know where.
I just kept driving.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.466
-Where's Vance? Is he.?

10:56.565 --> 10:58.165
-I texted him. He's okay.

10:58.267 --> 11:00.432
But, um.

11:00.532 --> 11:03.800
he told the police
that he started the fire.

11:06.468 --> 11:07.768
-He's got lawyers.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.168
And that's not
gonna change anything.

11:11.236 --> 11:13.836
He still lied to me
for 21 years.

11:13.903 --> 11:15.969
-He's your father.

11:16.036 --> 11:17.036
-As of yesterday.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.037
We should get back.

11:48.476 --> 11:49.643
-Thank you.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.043
-Please.

11:52.177 --> 11:55.543
-Just let me try to
explain myself.

11:55.610 --> 11:56.777
-No.

11:56.844 --> 11:58.811
Not right now anyways.

12:07.546 --> 12:08.747
Pull over.

12:36.985 --> 12:40.786
I think I should
stay here for a while.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.020
-Why?

12:52.055 --> 12:53.055
Because.

12:56.455 --> 12:58.690
because I just keep dragging you
into my shit, Tessa.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.057
It's not fair.

13:02.457 --> 13:04.057

16:45.436 --> 16:46.601
You're already going through--

-No. Tessa,
there is no rule that says

16:50.469 --> 16:53.803

can be in pain at a time.

16:53.869 --> 16:56.537
And for selfish reasons,
hearing about your problems

16:56.670 --> 16:59.005

better about my own.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.006
Talk to me.

17:02.705 --> 17:04.605
-I feel like I'm drowning.

17:07.705 --> 17:10.007
And I want to make it work,
but I just.

Thanks.

19:51.339 --> 19:53.073
-Hello.

19:53.140 --> 19:54.773
-Hi. Is Hardin there?

19:54.841 --> 19:57.807
-Uh, Scott is
disposed at the moment.

19:57.907 --> 19:59.941
Uh, are you gonna
come to the party?

20:00.008 --> 20:04.209
-Um. Yeah, I just need
the address again.

20:04.309 --> 20:05.541
It's 52, Warwick Street.

20:05.708 --> 20:06.708
-Ask her if she's hot.

20:06.843 --> 20:08.675
-Uh, my friend's asking
if you're hot.

20:08.776 --> 20:10.076
We're running out of
ten-out-of-tens here.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.077
-Ask her if she has friends.
-Yeah well, she hung up.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.177
Hey.

Let's get you a drink.

21:14.589 --> 21:15.757
Hey, Scott.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.490
Yo, give me that damn vodka.

21:17.589 --> 21:19.457

21:23.425 --> 21:24.691
-Oh, you two
knew each other?

21:29.726 --> 21:30.893
Yeah. I'm gonna
take that as a yes.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.228
Fucking hell!
Jesus Christ!

21:39.261 --> 21:40.495
What the fuck?

21:40.660 --> 21:41.895
-What? You're the only one
who gets to break things?

21:41.995 --> 21:43.329
-You didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

21:43.396 --> 21:45.095
What the hell
is wrong with you?

21:45.195 --> 21:46.628
What? Do you think you're
just gonna slum it here

21:46.763 --> 21:47.763
and you'll forget
about your problem?

21:47.829 --> 21:49.196
-Why the fuck
are you even here?

21:49.296 --> 21:51.196
-I'm not letting you get away
with being a coward again.

21:54.097 --> 21:55.765
I'm giving you one chance
to leave with me.

21:55.831 --> 21:57.998
But if I walk out the door
without you, that's it.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.867
-So, um, if she isn't
your girlfriend.

22:11.633 --> 22:12.501
-Just get the fuck away!

22:12.600 --> 22:14.001
Tessa, outside, now.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.169
-We're just playing about,
Scott.

22:21.568 --> 22:22.635
-Tess, what the fuck?

22:22.770 --> 22:24.803
-This is bullshit, Hardin.
This isn't us.

22:24.903 --> 22:28.038
-Us? What "us", Tess?
There is no us.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.471
We. we keep going round
in circles, and you,

22:30.570 --> 22:31.972
you just won't
fucking give up.

22:32.705 --> 22:35.672
-God! What more do you need?

22:35.806 --> 22:37.006
You don't belong here.

22:37.073 --> 22:39.173
You shouldn't be here.
You don't fit in here!

22:39.306 --> 22:40.740
So just go!

22:43.539 --> 22:44.940
-You win, Hardin.

22:47.108 --> 22:48.208

It's Landon.

<i>Mr. Scott's very busy</i>

28:27.709 --> 28:29.143
Whoa-oh!

28:30.043 --> 28:31.511
-Landon,
if I wanted to talk to you,

28:31.578 --> 28:34.044
I would have picked up the phone
the other 30 times you called.

28:34.077 --> 28:35.977
<i>You know what? I know</i>
<i>you're a selfish prick.</i>

28:36.010 --> 28:37.545

28:37.579 --> 28:39.245

Landon? What's wrong?

28:52.714 --> 28:53.914
<i>Just tell me she's okay.</i>

28:55.215 --> 28:56.148
-It's, um.

28:58.849 --> 29:00.849
it's Richard. He's dead.

29:00.882 --> 29:03.016
<i>And, uh, Tessa found him.</i>

29:06.150 --> 29:07.384

29:07.485 --> 29:09.118
Oh, fuck.

29:10.486 --> 29:12.318
Um. Where-- where is she?

29:12.452 --> 29:13.452
-We're at her mom's.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.152
She hasn't.
she hasn't spoken a word.

29:16.952 --> 29:18.686
-Can you let me talk to her?

29:18.819 --> 29:20.120
-I don't think
that's a good idea.

29:20.186 --> 29:21.086
-Please.

29:21.153 --> 29:23.121
Please just put the phone
to her ear.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.687
-You know, you really shouldn't
be speaking to her.

29:24.787 --> 29:25.887
-Then why the fuck
did you call?

29:25.987 --> 29:26.855
Of course,
I'm who she needs!

29:26.954 --> 29:28.422
You know us!
You know me!

29:28.455 --> 29:29.721
<i>All right, fine.</i>

29:29.821 --> 29:32.088
Just stay calm, okay?
Just give me a second.

29:40.257 --> 29:41.157
Hey, Tessa.

29:42.924 --> 29:43.691
I have Hardin on the phone
for you.

29:43.757 --> 29:45.225
-Um-mm, um-mm, um-umm.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.859
- Okay, okay. You don't have to.
- No, no. No, no.

29:46.891 --> 29:48.725
<i>No. No. No.</i>
<i>- It's fine.</i>

29:48.758 --> 29:50.892
- <i>Please, no! Don't worry. it's fine.</i>
- Tess.

29:52.393 --> 29:53.793
Fuck!

30:09.597 --> 30:10.696
Oh!

30:30.933 --> 30:32.667
-I mean, it's gonna be
me or your mom

30:32.801 --> 30:34.801
and she's gonna make you eat it.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.269
Looks pretty good.

30:38.969 --> 30:40.869
I'm just so tired.

30:43.202 --> 30:43.936
-Hmm.

30:59.373 --> 31:01.939
<i>You're enjoying yourself.</i>

31:02.039 --> 31:05.174
-One little slip
and it could all be over.

31:07.141 --> 31:08.808
-Are you still talking
about my shave?

31:13.443 --> 31:14.709
-I meant the shave,

31:14.809 --> 31:16.810
but if you wanted to
talk about last night.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.643
-I'm sorry, Tess.

31:20.743 --> 31:22.711
I didn't mean to
get that trashed.

31:22.744 --> 31:24.111
It's just with your dad--

31:24.145 --> 31:25.412
<i>I'm not my dad. I'm not him.</i>

31:27.078 --> 31:28.712
Tess, if you don't like it,
tell me.

31:28.812 --> 31:30.712
-I don't like it.
-Then I'll stop.

31:31.845 --> 31:33.013
I won't drink another drop.

31:33.146 --> 31:34.413
-Really?

31:51.351 --> 31:52.217
What-- what are you.?

32:21.689 --> 32:23.156
She doesn't want you
here.

32:23.257 --> 32:24.123
I didn't fly

32:24.224 --> 32:25.689
5,000 fucking miles
to argue with you.

32:25.756 --> 32:27.023
I don't know if she's
awake.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.391
Let me just at least see
if she's-- Hardin!

32:28.491 --> 32:29.525
-Tess.

32:29.625 --> 32:30.625
Hey.
- No. No, no.

32:30.724 --> 32:31.526
No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.892
-Do you want him here, Tess?

32:32.992 --> 32:34.425
-You're fucked if you think
I'm going anywhere.

32:34.492 --> 32:35.226
Tess.
-No, get off me!

32:35.293 --> 32:36.593
-Hey, it's okay.

32:36.692 --> 32:37.659
You gotta leave.

32:37.826 --> 32:39.026
You gotta leave
or I'm calling the cops?

32:39.059 --> 32:40.294
-Call the fucking cops.
Call 'em.

32:40.427 --> 32:41.893
I'm not going anywhere!
- That's not funny!

32:41.959 --> 32:43.693
-I'm not laughing!
-She doesn't want you here!

32:43.827 --> 32:45.528
You have no fucking idea
what she wants!

32:45.660 --> 32:46.728
-You weren't here
when she needed you!

32:46.860 --> 32:48.794
Now, you're make--
You're making it worse.

32:50.396 --> 32:51.596
- Tess?

32:51.695 --> 32:53.862
-Ugh,
she's trying to avoid you.

32:53.962 --> 32:54.862
You're the reason she took--

32:59.897 --> 33:01.231
-I'll check the front door.

33:27.403 --> 33:28.836
Hey, hey, Tess.

33:30.337 --> 33:32.937
-It's not about you.

33:33.036 --> 33:34.271
-I know.
I-- I just want to--

33:34.304 --> 33:35.338
I need <i>quiet </i> .

33:36.904 --> 33:37.838
Please.

34:20.181 --> 34:22.414
-I haven't always
treated you fairly.

34:22.547 --> 34:24.447
-You hate me, Carol.

34:24.547 --> 34:25.514
You've always hated me.

34:25.581 --> 34:26.947
And it's fine. I don't care.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.581
But you should know your opinion
means fuck all to me.

34:29.714 --> 34:31.550
And I mean that
in the nicest way.

34:31.616 --> 34:32.947
-You're exactly like him.

34:33.081 --> 34:35.049
That's exactly how Richard
used to talk to my parents.

34:35.117 --> 34:36.350
-I am not him.

34:36.417 --> 34:37.850
-All right. Well.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.949
I only care
about what's best for Tessa.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.318
-So do I.

34:41.418 --> 34:44.485
-The one thing that
I thought that I taught her,

34:44.618 --> 34:47.018
and you may not believe me,

34:47.119 --> 34:51.320
was to not have to depend on
a man the way that I did.

34:51.453 --> 34:53.686
And now, look at her.

34:53.819 --> 34:56.819
She's-- she's reduced to nothing
every time you leave.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.454
-Listen, I'm not--
-No, no. Let me finish.

34:59.521 --> 35:01.820
Yeah, you always come back

35:01.954 --> 35:05.223
the way that Richard
never did for us.

35:05.356 --> 35:06.855
But you never stay.

35:12.956 --> 35:15.292
-I don't know
what you want from me, Carol.

35:15.424 --> 35:16.592
I love her.

35:16.658 --> 35:18.125
I'm never letting her go.

35:18.225 --> 35:20.592
-If you really love her, then
you'll do what's best for her.

35:20.659 --> 35:22.159
And that is up to you now.

35:22.259 --> 35:25.093
Because you are the only person
that she'll listen to.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.860
That girl loves you way too much
for her own good.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.693
But Hardin,
you and I both know

35:31.826 --> 35:34.029
that you can't give her
what she needs.

35:34.161 --> 35:38.229
And that is stopping her
from finding someone who will.

35:57.433 --> 35:59.766
-I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

36:03.401 --> 36:06.800
I keep thinking about
the last time I saw him.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.734
He was eating
half my damn pizza.

36:08.801 --> 36:12.102
He was happy.

36:12.169 --> 36:14.336
-Just happy
he had a place to stay.

36:22.371 --> 36:26.339
-I am so sorry
for what happened in London.

36:32.706 --> 36:34.340
I really am.

36:34.407 --> 36:38.575
-I thought we had a love
that was out of a novel.

36:38.641 --> 36:41.042
And no matter how hard
or fast or tough it was,

36:41.108 --> 36:43.275
we'd survive to tell the story.

36:45.109 --> 36:47.109
Hey.

36:47.243 --> 36:51.344
We do. And we can.
We can survive it.

36:55.145 --> 36:57.478
-I don't wanna survive.
I want to live.

37:10.981 --> 37:14.582
I can't keep doing this.

37:14.682 --> 37:17.115
-Tess.

37:17.249 --> 37:20.782
-You don't love me enough
to fight for me.

37:20.915 --> 37:23.250
You gave up every time.

37:30.784 --> 37:33.319
-I tried.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.352
I really fucking tried.

37:40.386 --> 37:42.354
I'm sorry I couldn't fix you.

37:46.588 --> 37:48.355
-Me, too.

37:54.690 --> 37:55.722
Me, too.

38:24.996 --> 38:27.196
-Who's paying for all this?

38:27.263 --> 38:29.363
-You don't have to worry about
money right now, honey.

38:32.631 --> 38:33.863
-Hey.

38:35.231 --> 38:37.898
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

38:41.066 --> 38:45.633
Ugh. Hey, I got make up on--
-Oh. And.

38:45.666 --> 38:46.566
And a little bit of snot.

38:46.732 --> 38:47.832
Just a little bit.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.368
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39:35.710 --> 39:38.277
-I hadn't seen my father
for nine years.

39:40.510 --> 39:43.378
But reconnecting with him
was one of the greatest gifts.

39:45.378 --> 39:46.511
Even if it was only briefly.

39:50.379 --> 39:52.913
He had so many demons, but.

39:54.714 --> 39:57.381
he was also so kind.

40:01.048 --> 40:02.449
And he was trying
to be better for me.

40:05.781 --> 40:06.781
I know that.

40:24.853 --> 40:26.386
-You need a ride? Hardin?

40:29.053 --> 40:30.054
-I don't think I should go.

40:30.187 --> 40:32.588
-Why? You were his friend,
kind of.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.288
And you paid for it, so.

40:34.421 --> 40:37.189
-Landon, do me a favor
and keep that between us.

40:37.256 --> 40:38.989
-Sure. Doesn't mean
you shouldn't come.

40:39.122 --> 40:40.589
So, come.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.130
-Sorry,
I didn't know that you were.

41:23.098 --> 41:25.431
I don't know half these people.

41:25.498 --> 41:26.965
It's kind of weird.

41:27.032 --> 41:30.633
when people go to funerals of
someone they don't even know.

41:30.766 --> 41:32.500
-It's just especially him.

41:32.567 --> 41:35.067
I mean,
they're total hypocrites.

41:35.133 --> 41:37.734
No one here even liked him.

41:37.834 --> 41:38.867
-You did.

41:41.334 --> 41:42.402
And even I did.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.769
-I'm really mad at him.

41:46.869 --> 41:50.336
I'm like. I'm like pissed off.

41:50.403 --> 41:53.004
-Hey, you have every right
to be mad at him.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.671
Whether he's dead or not.

41:55.739 --> 42:00.272
I saw how much it meant to you
to have him back in your life.

42:00.338 --> 42:02.639
And I think he is an idiot

42:02.805 --> 42:05.139
for throwing that all the way
just to get high.

42:09.307 --> 42:11.174
But I mean, I'm one to talk,
aren't I?

42:13.341 --> 42:15.275
I'm so sorry
it took something like this

42:15.341 --> 42:18.009
for me to realize
how much you mean to me.

42:18.142 --> 42:22.243
And how much.
I want to be there for you.

42:31.045 --> 42:33.345
-I need to go back inside.

42:42.047 --> 42:43.414
-Okay.

42:54.650 --> 42:55.483
Oh, come on.

43:00.685 --> 43:03.118
Thank you so much
for everything.

43:03.251 --> 43:04.218
-Yeah, of course.

43:05.385 --> 43:06.885
-Hey, could I have a lift?

43:07.019 --> 43:08.386
My Ubers keep canceling.

43:08.519 --> 43:09.919
-I'm supposed
to be meeting Nora

43:10.052 --> 43:12.120
and I'm already late, so.

43:12.220 --> 43:13.453
-Cool.
-Yeah.

43:15.453 --> 43:16.420
We'll see if this one turns up.

43:18.787 --> 43:20.621
Do you want to come with me?

43:20.722 --> 43:22.289
Back to Ken's.

43:22.422 --> 43:25.122
-I should really stay here.

43:25.255 --> 43:26.657
It's been a long day

43:26.789 --> 43:28.691
and I've got a doctor's
appointment in Seattle.

43:28.822 --> 43:30.323
tomorrow.

43:30.456 --> 43:32.291
-Sure.

43:32.357 --> 43:33.524
Vance and Kimberly back?

43:33.591 --> 43:34.759
They get back
in the morning.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.624
They're trying to work
everything out for the baby.

43:42.259 --> 43:45.059
-You know what? I'm--
I'm gonna come with you.

43:45.192 --> 43:46.727
I'm gonna start
looking for places up there.

43:46.826 --> 43:48.193
I'm ready.

43:48.260 --> 43:49.960
-I don't-- I don't think--
-Tess. Tess,

43:50.060 --> 43:51.494
it's my turn
to be there for you.

43:53.194 --> 43:55.862
-I don't want anything
from you anymore.

44:01.796 --> 44:02.796
-I don't believe you.

44:05.130 --> 44:07.331
And I don't think
you believe yourself either.

44:25.267 --> 44:29.235
-I'm so sorry that we weren't
at your father's funeral.

44:29.368 --> 44:30.502
-No, no, it's fine.

44:30.568 --> 44:34.369
Um, ugh. I wouldn't have been
good company anyway.

44:36.436 --> 44:39.203
Uh, I was actually,

44:39.270 --> 44:41.570
I was thinking about
moving to New York.

44:43.138 --> 44:44.271
With Landon.

44:45.972 --> 44:48.640
-New York? That--

44:48.773 --> 44:50.539
Wow!

44:50.640 --> 44:52.140
What's your plan?

44:52.206 --> 44:53.540
Do you know where
you're gonna work, what--?

44:53.674 --> 44:56.206
-Not really.
I. I mean, I know it's far.

44:56.340 --> 44:58.508
I just think
that I need a fresh start.

45:00.474 --> 45:03.709
-Tessa,
it's okay to be sad.

45:03.808 --> 45:05.909
But if you let sadness
control your life,

45:06.043 --> 45:08.176
you'll never have one.

45:08.243 --> 45:12.010
-But what if I just always
feel like this?

45:12.077 --> 45:14.612
-What you've been through
is awful.

45:14.745 --> 45:16.144
But you are so strong,

45:16.277 --> 45:17.878
and I know
you'll get through this.

45:19.445 --> 45:22.179
It just takes time.

45:22.313 --> 45:25.479
And as for Hardin.

45:25.614 --> 45:28.147
girl, just do your best
to pretend you're moving on

45:28.314 --> 45:31.447
and eventually,
you'll believe it.

45:41.784 --> 45:43.916
-Why did you stay
if you knew she wanted him?

45:45.917 --> 45:48.817
-I loved her.

45:48.917 --> 45:50.851
I thought that she would see
that he couldn't give her

45:50.918 --> 45:54.218
the stability that I could.

45:54.285 --> 46:01.987
You know, I imagine if.
if Tessa marries another man,

46:02.120 --> 46:05.120
this is how he's gonna feel,
competing with a memory of you.

46:05.187 --> 46:07.454
-I'm not Vance, okay?
Just because.

46:10.656 --> 46:13.222
I'm not him.

46:19.190 --> 46:21.324
-You are.

46:22.725 --> 46:24.491
Okay.

46:30.959 --> 46:33.593
So, it's-- it's true.

46:33.694 --> 46:35.460
He's your father.

46:36.894 --> 46:40.928
I knew it. I knew it
the first time that I saw you.

46:40.995 --> 46:42.995
You look just like him.

46:43.128 --> 46:44.563
I did everything so wrong.

46:47.395 --> 46:49.463
And I couldn't stand
that you were his.

46:51.664 --> 46:54.364
That doesn't excuse
the drinking, but.

46:57.964 --> 46:59.831
I've loved you.

46:59.964 --> 47:01.398
I still love you.

47:04.932 --> 47:06.232
You're my son.

47:20.770 --> 47:21.537
I'm sorry.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.609
-Let's talk about
these test results.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.875
Unfortunately,
the chances are very slim

47:53.942 --> 47:56.711
that you will carry to term.

47:56.744 --> 47:59.410

49:38.163 --> 49:39.365
-Tessa?

49:40.832 --> 49:42.230
Hey, Tess.

49:44.366 --> 49:45.566
- Hardin.

49:45.699 --> 49:46.566
-Hey, come inside.

49:48.932 --> 49:50.400
-I had a feeling you'd come.

49:50.467 --> 49:51.734
- Did you?
- Yeah.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.601
It's late.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.966
-It is.

50:02.167 --> 50:05.035
- Do you want
a baby with me?

50:05.168 --> 50:06.670
-No, I don't want
a baby with you.

50:08.536 --> 50:10.371
-I mean.

50:10.471 --> 50:11.504
I just.

50:13.204 --> 50:14.870
I don't want a baby right now.

50:17.237 --> 50:18.505
-I love sleep.

50:18.572 --> 50:22.171
My life has the tendency
to fall apart when I'm awake.

50:22.271 --> 50:24.773
- Your life is
gonna be just fine, okay?

50:24.905 --> 50:28.440
-You said it once.
There can be no happy end to it.

50:30.307 --> 50:31.508
I didn't mean that.

50:32.874 --> 50:34.241
And I shouldn't have said it.

50:37.376 --> 50:39.042
-I love you enough now.

50:39.175 --> 50:41.443
What do you want to do?

50:41.510 --> 50:43.443
- I love you.
- Shush. We can quote Hemingway

50:43.510 --> 50:45.444
when we're sober, okay?

50:45.511 --> 50:47.811
For now, just go to sleep.

50:50.746 --> 50:52.244
Go to sleep.

50:53.512 --> 50:55.245
-Stay.

51:24.218 --> 51:25.452
-Morning.

51:25.552 --> 51:26.552
-Morning.

51:28.619 --> 51:34.587
Um,
what did I say last night?

51:36.186 --> 51:39.322
You mean,
besides quoting Hemingway?

51:39.422 --> 51:42.055
-Oh, no, I didn't.

51:42.121 --> 51:43.289
-It wasn't that bad.

51:48.656 --> 51:49.590
Do you, uh.

51:51.457 --> 51:52.990
do you want to tell me
what's been bothering you?

51:55.258 --> 51:56.859
-It's nothing.
It's the doctor.

51:56.991 --> 51:58.024
Listen.

51:59.359 --> 52:00.793
if you are pregnant,
I just wanted to say

52:00.859 --> 52:03.393
that I would genuinely
be okay with that.

52:04.593 --> 52:06.660
It really would not be so bad
having kids with you.

52:09.461 --> 52:12.762
Or, obviously, if you're--
if you're not pregnant,

52:12.862 --> 52:15.529
I guess maybe
after you finish college,

52:15.596 --> 52:17.863
or I don't know, either way.

52:22.095 --> 52:23.530
-I can't get pregnant.

52:26.163 --> 52:28.831
The. the doctor said
that it'll--

52:28.930 --> 52:32.332
it'd be almost impossible
for me to conceive.

52:32.465 --> 52:35.165
And even if I did, there'd be
a high risk of miscarriage

52:35.233 --> 52:36.533
so I can't.

52:44.868 --> 52:46.033
-Agh!

52:47.502 --> 52:49.302
-Uh, can you say somethin'?

52:52.935 --> 52:54.404
-I don't know what to say.

52:54.504 --> 52:55.935
-What do you-- what do you mean,
you don't know what--

52:56.069 --> 52:57.003
you don't want kids anyway.

52:57.069 --> 53:00.036
-No, I-I-I didn't.

53:01.438 --> 53:03.971
Now, it just feels like
it's been taken away from us.

53:04.071 --> 53:06.572
-Uh, no, not from you.
From me.

53:10.206 --> 53:11.473
-Wait.

53:11.573 --> 53:12.973
That was the wrong thing to say.
You know I didn't mean it.

53:13.073 --> 53:14.573
Tess, wait. Please wait.

53:15.608 --> 53:17.173
Tessa.

53:17.274 --> 53:19.375
-Please just don't
shut down on me again.

53:19.508 --> 53:23.509
I don't give a fuck if we can
have kids or not, honestly.

53:23.609 --> 53:25.543
-I'm sorry that you feel like
I took something from you.

53:25.643 --> 53:26.909
-I don't.
-But you're not the one

53:27.008 --> 53:29.244
who's just had their dreams
crushed here, you know?

53:30.909 --> 53:32.544
Like you didn't want kids
until two seconds ago

53:32.644 --> 53:34.577
which just came out of nowhere.

53:38.278 --> 53:39.578
-I just want to be with you.

53:41.011 --> 53:43.446
Kids, no kids.

53:43.546 --> 53:44.679
When I was in London,

53:44.780 --> 53:46.547
I could not stop
thinking about you.

53:48.313 --> 53:51.515
-Right. Yeah, I'm sure--
I'm sure you saw my face

53:51.648 --> 53:53.848
when you were sleeping
with that girl at the party.

53:53.947 --> 53:55.349
-Who are you.? What?

53:55.449 --> 53:59.150
Te-- nothing
of the sort happened.

53:59.216 --> 54:00.483
And I won't lie to you.
-Shut up. You did.

54:00.583 --> 54:02.884
-She did-- she did try
to kiss me and when she did,

54:03.016 --> 54:05.684
I literally threw up, so.

54:05.784 --> 54:08.217
-You literally threw up.

54:08.317 --> 54:09.419
-I did.

54:09.518 --> 54:11.585
- Threw up.
- I threw up.

54:11.719 --> 54:15.586
Instant noodles, and it went
on her head.

54:18.787 --> 54:19.919
-Good.

54:20.052 --> 54:21.454
- Good?

54:22.821 --> 54:24.155
- Yeah, good.
- Good.

54:37.290 --> 54:39.857
And that is why
Hardin is afraid of gerbils.

54:42.458 --> 54:43.892
-If you don't stop
makin' up stories,

54:43.991 --> 54:45.792
I'll tell Nora about that time
you wet yourself.

54:47.292 --> 54:48.259
-Touché.

54:48.359 --> 54:49.293
-All right, then.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.894
-This is so good.
The sauce is amazing.

54:51.992 --> 54:53.827
-It's all of Landon's favorites
before he leaves us.

54:53.926 --> 54:57.026
-This food
almost makes me sad to go.

54:57.127 --> 55:00.895
-So Nora, what part of New York
are you in?

55:00.994 --> 55:03.328
-Um, East 14th
and First Ave.

55:03.395 --> 55:06.430
-What she actually meant was
how far is it from Landon.

55:06.530 --> 55:08.229
Oh. Um.

55:08.329 --> 55:10.597
-Like.
-Like 50 minutes by train.

55:10.696 --> 55:12.097
-Fifty minutes.

55:12.197 --> 55:13.364
I'm sorry. It's just
practically long distance.

55:13.431 --> 55:14.631
I don't know how
you're gonna make that work.

55:14.697 --> 55:16.398
-I mean,
I have to go through there

55:16.498 --> 55:17.865
to get to class every day.

55:17.964 --> 55:19.166
I mean, not--
not that we'd be

55:19.299 --> 55:21.533
seeing each other every day.
But I mean, we could

55:21.633 --> 55:23.833
if you wanted too.

55:26.032 --> 55:28.000
-So, Hardin,
graduation is looming.

55:28.101 --> 55:29.234
-No, we're not doing this again.
I don't want--

55:29.334 --> 55:30.368
-Have you given more thought
to--

55:30.468 --> 55:31.933
-No, I haven't
'cause I'm not going to

55:32.000 --> 55:33.735
walk for graduation, okay?
I don't want to walk.

55:33.868 --> 55:35.169
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

55:35.269 --> 55:36.369
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

55:36.502 --> 55:37.669
-Hm.

55:38.602 --> 55:40.136
I just thought.

55:40.236 --> 55:42.570
I don't know. I just thought
for sure you'd reconsider.

55:43.737 --> 55:45.237
-So you've obviously asked her

55:45.371 --> 55:47.538
to ask me?
- What? What?

55:48.838 --> 55:50.338
Fuck it, fine. I'll walk
for graduation then.

55:52.037 --> 55:53.439
- Yes!
- Don't make me change my mind.

55:54.639 --> 55:56.406
-To walking.

55:56.506 --> 55:57.406
Cheers to that.

55:57.506 --> 55:59.673
- To walking.
- Cheers to that.

55:59.807 --> 56:00.441
- To walking.
- Here we go again.

56:07.508 --> 56:09.642
Come on.

56:20.044 --> 56:23.845
-Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

56:23.912 --> 56:25.045
-Okay.

56:41.081 --> 56:43.582
-I made a decision
about something, and I didn't.

56:46.016 --> 56:48.817
With everything
that's been going on

56:48.917 --> 56:51.083
because of a lot of things, but.

56:53.717 --> 56:55.151
we need time apart.

56:55.218 --> 57:01.419
Like. like really apart.

57:01.519 --> 57:02.419
And--

57:03.519 --> 57:05.820
-This seems like
the only way to make sure

57:05.886 --> 57:08.454
that that actually happen.

57:08.587 --> 57:09.953
-Okay, why?

57:10.087 --> 57:12.954
-Because we fight
more than we get along.

57:13.055 --> 57:16.988
And when we make up,
it's over sex.

57:19.123 --> 57:21.223
-That's not--
that's not really true.

57:21.323 --> 57:23.057
-It is, and it's not healthy.

57:23.156 --> 57:26.024
How is sex not healthy?

57:26.124 --> 57:30.058
We've been having lots of fun,
happy, consensual sex.

57:30.158 --> 57:33.125
And it's been full of fucking
love and fucking trust.

57:33.192 --> 57:36.092
-I can't keep going around
in circles like this.

57:37.893 --> 57:42.227
-Okay, okay.
I understand.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.694
And I do have a lot to work on.

57:44.794 --> 57:45.928
But we have so much time.

57:46.028 --> 57:47.728
We have all the time
in the world,

57:47.795 --> 57:48.728
and I will work on them.

57:48.829 --> 57:49.829
And I can come live with you

57:49.929 --> 57:52.296
in Seattle.
-Okay. Okay.

57:52.429 --> 57:54.763
I'm moving.

57:54.863 --> 57:56.664
-Okay.

57:56.764 --> 57:58.564
I'm moving to New York.

57:58.664 --> 58:00.131
I'm gonna live with Landon.

58:00.231 --> 58:01.531
-Landon?

58:01.631 --> 58:02.531
What? This was his idea?

58:02.665 --> 58:04.631
-No, no, no.
This was my idea.

58:04.698 --> 58:05.832
This wasn't. don't--

58:05.932 --> 58:06.998
-He's supposed to be
my fucking brother.

58:07.132 --> 58:09.632
-It's not like that.
It's-- no! Hey!

58:10.899 --> 58:11.600
- No, no.
- I'm just gonna--

58:11.667 --> 58:12.834
New York!

58:12.900 --> 58:13.867
New York!
You didn't fucking tell me!

58:13.967 --> 58:15.067
Well, it wasn't
my call.

58:15.167 --> 58:16.367
You'd broken up with her.
What do you--?

58:16.434 --> 58:18.234
-You've been pretending
to be my fucking friend!

58:18.334 --> 58:20.302
-I didn't pretend shit, Hardin!

58:20.402 --> 58:23.101
I'm her friend too, and I'm
cleaning up your shit as usual.

58:24.435 --> 58:25.203
Well, go ahead.

58:25.303 --> 58:26.603
Fucking hit me, you big man.

58:26.703 --> 58:27.970
Big piece of shit.

58:36.505 --> 58:38.605
- Fuck.

58:57.742 --> 59:01.109
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tess, but.

59:02.643 --> 59:04.710
You know, of all people,

59:04.777 --> 59:07.946
he knows
how much you mean to me.

59:08.077 --> 59:09.178
That you're my

59:09.277 --> 59:10.744
fucking lifeline,
and he didn't tell me,

59:10.811 --> 59:12.779
and that fucking hurts.

59:12.913 --> 59:15.979
It fucking hurts, okay?

59:20.680 --> 59:22.280
I'm shit without you.

59:25.415 --> 59:29.548
-I'm just as good at dooming
this relationship as you.

59:29.682 --> 59:31.349
Is it doomed?

59:31.483 --> 59:33.382
Is it? I feel like
we can make this work.

59:35.116 --> 59:38.050
-You're trying,
and I see that. But I.

59:38.150 --> 59:40.051
I can't keep doing this
back and forth.

59:40.151 --> 59:42.886
It's-- it's-- it's
not just with you.

59:42.984 --> 59:44.185
It's with me.

59:44.251 --> 59:46.219
-You can't just escape yourself

59:46.285 --> 59:48.185
by moving from one place
to another, you know.

59:50.686 --> 59:52.153
You know that, right?

59:52.253 --> 59:56.955
-I need to figure things out.
And. if you love me,

59:57.087 --> 59:59.187
if you really love me--
- I do. I do.

59:59.321 --> 01:00:01.388
-then I need you to promise
not to follow me.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.522
- I can't do that.
- Promise me.

01:00:05.655 --> 01:00:06.923
-I can't do that.

01:00:06.989 --> 01:00:09.023
We can make this work!
-Promise not to follow me.

01:00:09.123 --> 01:00:10.424
Give me some time

01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:14.524
or we're gonna end up
taking everyone down with us.

01:00:14.624 --> 01:00:15.724
-How long?

01:00:18.725 --> 01:00:20.825
How long, Tess?

01:00:20.893 --> 01:00:22.593
How long?

01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:23.927
-I don't know.

01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:25.193
I don't know.

01:00:27.393 --> 01:00:29.594

what he's doing in town?

01:03:20.762 --> 01:03:21.628
-What?

01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:23.529
-You don't know
why Hardin's coming?

01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:25.395
-He did not say, but uh,

01:03:25.462 --> 01:03:27.429
I couldn't have him
staying at a hotel.

01:03:27.496 --> 01:03:29.229
Especially with a minibar.
Is that shitty?

01:03:29.296 --> 01:03:30.764
I know he's sober now.

01:03:30.831 --> 01:03:33.230
-No, no. No, I get it.

01:03:33.297 --> 01:03:35.464
And, you know, I mean,

01:03:35.564 --> 01:03:37.298
I'm working doubles
this week anyway,

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:40.331
so I won't even
have to see him.

01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:44.199
-Nora said if, uh,
it gets too weird,

01:03:44.266 --> 01:03:45.200
you can crash at her place.

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.333
I mean it's just.
ei-- either way,

01:03:46.433 --> 01:03:48.001
it was going to be
shitty like--

01:03:48.066 --> 01:03:49.801
-Oh no, it's fine.
I'll be fine.

01:03:49.902 --> 01:03:51.002
-You're doing the thing

01:03:51.134 --> 01:03:52.067
where you go, you go--
- Oh, please.

01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:53.669
-"I'll be fine,"
and you look away.

01:03:53.769 --> 01:03:54.836
Honestly?

01:03:54.936 --> 01:03:55.936
-Yeah.

01:03:56.035 --> 01:03:57.035
-Wallet, keys, phone?
-Yes.

01:03:57.135 --> 01:03:58.770
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:03:58.904 --> 01:03:59.803
-Ciao.

01:04:09.672 --> 01:04:16.473
-Hey, so Landon just got here,
and Hardin is with him.

01:04:17.473 --> 01:04:19.606
They are asking
for your section.

01:04:21.807 --> 01:04:24.207
-Uh. yeah, of course.

01:04:24.307 --> 01:04:27.608
-You sure?
-Yeah. I guess.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.378
-Tessa.

01:04:45.746 --> 01:04:47.579
Theresa?

01:04:47.647 --> 01:04:50.345
-Uh, yeah.

01:04:50.479 --> 01:04:53.313
I put my full name
on the job application.

01:04:53.446 --> 01:04:55.313
-Uh, Hardin wanted to eat here.

01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:57.015
That's. that's.

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:58.682
-That's fine.

01:04:59.815 --> 01:05:00.715
Yeah, of course.

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:01.849
Let me seat you guys.

01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:03.616
Yeah.

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:05.650
Nice to see you.

01:05:05.816 --> 01:05:06.716
Nice to see you, too.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.716
Yup.

01:05:14.752 --> 01:05:16.418
Sorry.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:24.152
-So, you've been here
since this morning.

01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:26.720
-Yeah,
I'm working a double today.

01:05:26.854 --> 01:05:28.287
-When will you get off?

01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:34.789
-Uh, one, so I should be home
around two.

01:05:34.923 --> 01:05:37.389
-Every single day.

01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:42.523
-And I'll try
not to wake you, again.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.490
What can I get you guys?

01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:54.492
Good night.

01:06:00.393 --> 01:06:02.394
-I just wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

01:06:03.595 --> 01:06:06.295
-You do know that
I walk this every night, right?

01:06:12.095 --> 01:06:13.529
Since you're here.

01:06:19.263 --> 01:06:21.331
-So why are you
working here anyway?

01:06:21.463 --> 01:06:24.032
Isn't Vance opening
his new publishing house?

01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:27.265
-Uh, I just want to do
something on my own.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:31.099
I like it. Nora's here.

01:06:31.233 --> 01:06:33.568
I make more money
than you'd think.

01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:37.868
Uh, plus it keeps me busy while
I'm waiting to get into NYU.

01:06:37.968 --> 01:06:40.234
-What?
You haven't gotten in yet?

01:06:40.334 --> 01:06:44.368
-No, but I'm hoping
for the spring semester.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.436
-Are you happy?

01:06:50.637 --> 01:06:52.103
-Yeah.

01:06:52.203 --> 01:06:53.504
-Are you seeing anyone?

01:06:54.437 --> 01:06:57.805
- Yes.
I'm out every night

01:06:57.905 --> 01:07:00.839
being wined and dined.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.139
-I'm actually
not dating anyone.

01:07:02.239 --> 01:07:04.172
I'm quite conservative
in that way.

01:07:04.306 --> 01:07:05.640
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey, watch it!

01:07:05.707 --> 01:07:06.674
-Hey! It's okay.

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:09.841
Hey, Joe.

01:07:09.975 --> 01:07:12.675
Uh, I brought you some fries and
the sliders that you love.

01:07:14.174 --> 01:07:15.509
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:22.443
It makes me feel better
about my dad.

01:07:26.844 --> 01:07:28.210
-Do you wanna.?

01:07:29.277 --> 01:07:30.979
Tomorrow,
if you're not working,

01:07:31.111 --> 01:07:33.445
I have some free time
if you wanna.?

01:07:36.279 --> 01:07:40.079
-I'm working a double.
that I took

01:07:40.179 --> 01:07:43.447
so I wouldn't have to see you.

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:05.384
Hey.

01:08:05.451 --> 01:08:06.752
- Stop.
- Hey, hey.

01:08:06.819 --> 01:08:09.053
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
- Hey, Hardin.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:13.420
-Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:08:14.955 --> 01:08:15.955
It's okay.

01:08:17.787 --> 01:08:19.455

I'm still me.

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.282
A fair bit of therapy,

01:10:38.383 --> 01:10:40.350
and I'm hitting the gym more
but I'm still me.

01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:45.484

if that's what you mean.

01:11:01.487 --> 01:11:03.120
- Mm.
- Tess.

01:11:07.822 --> 01:11:09.121
Well, how is it then?

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:12.122
-Mm.

01:11:13.323 --> 01:11:14.289
Oi, Tess.

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:15.857
At least share it
if you're gonna.

01:11:34.761 --> 01:11:36.293
You know,
if I wasn't such a gentleman,

01:11:36.394 --> 01:11:38.160
I would have you
on this counter right now.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.362
-I thought
you weren't a gentleman.

01:11:43.161 --> 01:11:45.496
I'm half gentleman right now.

01:11:47.129 --> 01:11:48.530
-A half?

01:11:48.663 --> 01:11:49.497
-Uh-huh.

01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:54.931
And that means.

01:11:55.031 --> 01:11:56.498
as much as I want you.

01:11:59.299 --> 01:12:00.532
I can't be with you.

01:12:03.232 --> 01:12:05.367
until you're really ready
to be with me.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:11.266
-Or. what?

01:12:12.635 --> 01:12:13.635
Come on,
grab some plates.

01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:14.502
Let's eat.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:21.803
-Tess, plates.
Now, please.

01:12:43.907 --> 01:12:45.308
-What?

01:12:47.441 --> 01:12:48.908
-Nothing.

01:12:54.209 --> 01:12:55.310

Finally.

01:13:18.382 --> 01:13:20.882
-And it feels good.

01:13:22.049 --> 01:13:24.282
-I'm gonna go take a shower.

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:27.149

01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:40.986
Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:41.953
-How's work?

01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:42.986
-Good.

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:46.787
Long.

01:13:48.087 --> 01:13:50.688
Is, um, is Landon home?

01:13:50.788 --> 01:13:52.321
-Uh, he's staying at Nora's.

01:13:55.656 --> 01:13:58.223
Are you going out?

01:13:58.356 --> 01:13:58.822
-No.

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:00.556
Got an early meeting tomorrow.

01:14:21.327 --> 01:14:22.527

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.541

without this.

01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:34.442
Just saying.

01:15:53.179 --> 01:15:55.346

01:18:50.847 --> 01:18:52.915
-So, by sleeping with me,
I think you just agreed

01:18:53.049 --> 01:18:54.049
to start seeing me again.

01:18:54.116 --> 01:18:56.382
-Mm. is that so?

01:18:56.449 --> 01:18:57.515
-Mm-hm.

01:18:59.084 --> 01:19:00.816
I love this.
-What?

01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:02.316
-This. Us.

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:06.651
You know we're always going to
be like this, Tess.

01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:11.652
-I really have to
go to this meeting

01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:13.986
so I will see you when I'm back.
-Okay.

01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:17.853
Okay.

01:19:37.091 --> 01:19:39.058
<i>It was the fall</i>
<i>when he met her.</i>

01:19:39.092 --> 01:19:42.092
<i>In his world, he was only</i>
<i>concerned about one thing.</i>

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.992
<i>himself.</i>

01:19:44.026 --> 01:19:45.825
<i>He'd won every bet so far,</i>

01:19:45.858 --> 01:19:47.960
<i>and this was</i>
<i>supposed to be no different,</i>

01:19:47.993 --> 01:19:49.592
<i>although in Tessa's nearness,</i>

01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:52.760
<i>he felt an apprehension</i>
<i>this time.</i>

01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:55.928
<i>In a Darcy-inspired gesture,</i>
<i>he funded her father's funeral.</i>

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:59.761
<i>It was only the beginning of</i>
<i>what he felt he needed to do</i>

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:02.428
<i>to absolve himself.</i>

01:20:02.462 --> 01:20:04.829
<i>His guilt led heavy in the call</i>
<i>that he hadn't answered.</i>

01:20:07.197 --> 01:20:08.629
<i>The only reason he didn't</i>
<i>lose himself</i>

01:20:08.663 --> 01:20:09.763
<i>again in darkness.</i>

01:20:09.796 --> 01:20:12.198
<i>.was in knowing</i>
<i>her dad was happy.</i>

01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:13.932
<i>His death</i>
<i>was surely an accident.</i>

01:20:13.965 --> 01:20:16.431
<i>It didn't bring him back,</i>
<i>but his talk of his future</i>

01:20:16.465 --> 01:20:18.364
<i>and appreciating</i>
<i>the time off the street.</i>

01:20:19.531 --> 01:20:21.833
<i>Though she was unable to</i>
<i>bear children of her own,</i>

01:20:21.866 --> 01:20:24.300
<i>she couldn't let go</i>
<i>of the dream of them.</i>

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:27.067
<i>He knew that,</i>
<i>and loved her even so.</i>

01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:28.767
<i>He tried not to be selfish.</i>

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.202
<i>But he couldn't help thinking
about the little versions of him</i>

01:20:31.234 --> 01:20:32.434
<i>she couldn't give him.</i>

01:20:33.835 --> 01:20:36.602
<i>He hopes she will understand</i>
<i>just how broken he was</i>

01:20:36.635 --> 01:20:38.802
<i>and see how much</i>
<i>she affected his life.</i>

01:20:49.172 --> 01:20:50.438
-"She stumbled

01:20:50.572 --> 01:20:52.906
"through the room the way
that tasteless girls move

01:20:53.006 --> 01:20:54.705
when they drink too much."

01:20:54.772 --> 01:20:56.107
-Stop reading that.

01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:58.941
-No, no, no,
you don't get to write my story

01:20:59.074 --> 01:21:00.540
and then tell me
I can't read it.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:01.741
-That part's not about you.

01:21:01.807 --> 01:21:04.842
-How long have you been
writing about us?

01:21:09.775 --> 01:21:11.275
-After we kissed.

01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:12.977
-You. like the first time?

01:21:16.443 --> 01:21:17.945
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:21:19.677 --> 01:21:20.810
You're just.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.344
Tess, I'll explain

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:24.411
if you'll just listen.
-Oh, no.

01:21:24.544 --> 01:21:27.079
You already have,
on every page.

01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:28.812
-This is what I did to vent.
-Great.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880
-Where are you going?

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.613
- I.
- Tess!

01:21:31.713 --> 01:21:34.480
-I'm done. This. we're just a
bomb waiting to explode.

01:21:34.546 --> 01:21:36.048
This was a wake-up call.
-What do you mean?

01:21:36.115 --> 01:21:37.215
You're acting like I wrote that

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.347
to purposely hurt you.
-How--

01:21:38.414 --> 01:21:39.915
how did you think
I was gonna feel?

01:21:40.049 --> 01:21:41.548
-It was not all about you.

01:21:41.615 --> 01:21:44.515
-You would never let me read
what you were writing in there.

01:21:44.582 --> 01:21:46.050
And now the whole world gets to.

01:21:46.117 --> 01:21:47.851
Stuff about me.

01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:49.383
Stuff about my dad.

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:53.417
-I'm sorry. I never meant
for it to be published.

01:21:53.484 --> 01:21:55.952
I started that journal to
figure the shit out in my head.

01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:58.451
They asked me to read it
in group therapy, so I did.

01:21:58.518 --> 01:22:01.186
And one thing
just led to another.

01:22:01.319 --> 01:22:04.121
-You accidentally
wrote a book.

01:22:04.187 --> 01:22:05.854
-I.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.253
I didn't mean
for this to happen this way.

01:22:10.354 --> 01:22:13.989
-No one
wants to read this sick shit.

01:22:14.056 --> 01:22:15.688
I thought that too.

01:22:15.822 --> 01:22:18.990
But there's a bidding war
for my book.

01:22:20.923 --> 01:22:22.389
And that's why I'm in town.

01:22:25.557 --> 01:22:26.858
-You accidentally wrote a book

01:22:26.924 --> 01:22:29.624
and then you shopped it
around to publishers

01:22:29.758 --> 01:22:31.759
without asking me?

01:22:31.892 --> 01:22:34.227
-Fuck, this never
should have happened like this.

01:22:34.292 --> 01:22:36.292
-No, no. It shouldn't have.

01:22:36.392 --> 01:22:38.693
-Tess, I hated myself.

01:22:38.794 --> 01:22:41.460
I had to deal with that
every fucking day.

01:22:41.527 --> 01:22:44.360
What is the point in everything
we've been through if we can't

01:22:44.494 --> 01:22:46.661
channel that into something
that helps people?

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:49.728
-I don't want people reading
about my life and judging me.

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:52.063
-It's not your life, Tess.
It's our lives,

01:22:52.163 --> 01:22:53.864
and it's a story
about forgiveness

01:22:53.997 --> 01:22:56.030
and unconditional love.

01:22:57.697 --> 01:23:00.464
It doesn't matter about
parents or addiction

01:23:00.597 --> 01:23:03.397
or whatever fucked up past.
It's never too late.

01:23:03.531 --> 01:23:05.066
People can always change.

01:23:05.133 --> 01:23:07.398
That is the kind of story
"After" is.

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.399
-"After"?

01:23:11.433 --> 01:23:13.768
-It's my journey
after I met you.

01:23:15.633 --> 01:23:17.400
-I think that journey is over.

01:24:13.212 --> 01:24:15.913

that I had hit rock bottom

and then I'd hit it again harder
and again and again,

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:20.847

a fucking house.

01:24:23.647 --> 01:24:26.615

what I'm trying to say is

01:24:26.682 --> 01:24:27.783
thank you all.

01:24:29.183 --> 01:24:31.616

when I walked in that door,

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.482
I. I didn't know
how this would go.

01:24:33.616 --> 01:24:34.649
I didn't think
it would work for me.

01:24:34.784 --> 01:24:35.950
I never open up.

01:24:36.084 --> 01:24:39.316

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.651

I feel like I'm actually
a better version of myself

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:55.888
and I haven't tried to
better myself ever, really.

01:24:58.387 --> 01:24:59.889

01:25:48.965 --> 01:25:50.166
Mm.

01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:51.932
I have something for you.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.100
Look at this.

01:25:58.332 --> 01:26:00.834
Your name.

01:26:00.967 --> 01:26:03.034
I'm so proud of you.

01:26:12.369 --> 01:26:13.435
I'm so sorry.

01:26:13.637 --> 01:26:16.837
-Mum, it's fine.
I've been going through so much.

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:18.537
-No, but.

01:26:18.604 --> 01:26:20.738
I didn't know what to do.

01:26:20.805 --> 01:26:22.437
I was young, I was.

01:26:24.404 --> 01:26:26.039
in love and I was terrified.

01:26:27.539 --> 01:26:29.239
None of that excuses the fact

01:26:29.305 --> 01:26:31.673
that I hid the truth from you
for so long.

01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:32.774
But.

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:37.742
everything I did,
every decision I made,

01:26:37.809 --> 01:26:40.809
no matter how regrettable
looking back, it was.

01:26:43.441 --> 01:26:45.475
it was done out of love for you.

01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:48.911
-I know it was, Mum.

01:26:50.178 --> 01:26:51.744
And thank you for saying that.

01:26:55.578 --> 01:26:56.711
It's good, all right?

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:58.444
-This is amazing.

01:27:01.046 --> 01:27:03.213
Checkout took forever.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.914
Yes. Yes. No,
I'm on my way back now.

01:27:20.817 --> 01:27:23.984
Sorry, yeah.

01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:25.449
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:33.119
Hi. Look at you, so official.

01:27:33.219 --> 01:27:38.053
-Hi. You have to tell me
everything.

01:27:38.153 --> 01:27:39.452
-Hasn't been that long.

01:27:42.221 --> 01:27:43.221
-I think it's just
since Landon

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.589
basically moved in
with Nora that.

01:27:46.655 --> 01:27:48.255
-You're starved for attention.

01:27:48.354 --> 01:27:49.989
-Mm. I thought
it would be easier

01:27:50.123 --> 01:27:52.455
making friends at school.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:55.857
-Yeah. The campus
is pretty spread out, huh?

01:27:55.957 --> 01:27:57.490
-Yeah. And it's just
by the time you figure out

01:27:57.591 --> 01:27:58.891
where to meet
and how to get there

01:27:59.025 --> 01:28:00.225
on the subway and the buses,

01:28:00.356 --> 01:28:02.225
it's like an hour
to do anything.

01:28:02.324 --> 01:28:03.559
-Welcome to New York.

01:28:03.659 --> 01:28:06.425
- So I hope
you like chicken alfredo.

01:28:08.293 --> 01:28:09.293
-Er.
-What?

01:28:09.392 --> 01:28:10.458
-I should've mentioned this.
I'm--

01:28:10.593 --> 01:28:11.960
I'm actually doing
the plant-based thing.

01:28:12.093 --> 01:28:13.127
-I don't know
why I didn't ask.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.227
I should have just asked.

01:28:14.326 --> 01:28:15.261
-No, no.
You know, let's improvise.

01:28:15.359 --> 01:28:16.460
You got any red sauce?

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.696
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

01:28:22.796 --> 01:28:24.461
Tessa. Tess. Hey.
-I'm sorry.

01:28:26.163 --> 01:28:27.797
-Don't worry about it.

01:28:27.863 --> 01:28:28.931
I'll order somethin' in.

01:28:28.997 --> 01:28:32.164
Mm.

01:28:32.264 --> 01:28:33.298
-You wanna try?

01:28:33.397 --> 01:28:34.798
-What is it?

01:28:34.932 --> 01:28:36.364
-Tofu curry dumpling.

01:28:36.464 --> 01:28:37.732
Is it spicy?

01:28:37.832 --> 01:28:39.165
-Not-- not. just try it.

01:28:39.265 --> 01:28:40.398
-Okay.

01:28:46.366 --> 01:28:47.466
-Yeah?
-Mm.

01:28:49.035 --> 01:28:51.135
It's not-- it's not bad.

01:28:51.235 --> 01:28:52.001
-But.?

01:28:52.135 --> 01:28:53.334
- It's not good.

01:28:53.434 --> 01:28:55.203
Oh, come on.

01:28:55.302 --> 01:28:57.069
So one of my classmates
invited us

01:28:57.136 --> 01:28:59.203
to his girlfriend's
gallery opening

01:28:59.269 --> 01:29:00.903
in the village tonight.
- Mm-hm.

01:29:00.970 --> 01:29:03.137
-Do you wanna go?

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:07.538
-Um, yeah.
I mean, I'd love to but.

01:29:07.638 --> 01:29:09.505
I've actually got this thing
tonight.

01:29:09.605 --> 01:29:10.905
Can we do it another time?

01:29:11.005 --> 01:29:13.806
-Yeah. Of course.

01:29:13.873 --> 01:29:15.806
-Okay.

01:29:19.707 --> 01:29:22.508
So after she
kicked me out,

01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:24.208
I really felt
that my entire world

01:29:24.308 --> 01:29:26.374
was just crumbling around me.

01:29:26.442 --> 01:29:27.842
I was afraid
I was going to spiral.

01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:31.009
I really had
nothing going for me.

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:34.043
But then I got the call.

01:29:35.677 --> 01:29:39.611
Dowless and Sons wanted the book
to release immediately.

01:29:39.744 --> 01:29:43.312
So, I picked up the phone
and I called.

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.579
I called my therapist.

01:29:47.412 --> 01:29:48.479
And I took a breath.

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.980
and I took the deal.

01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:54.848
And here we are.

01:30:12.251 --> 01:30:14.585
Anyway, I'll, uh,
I'll stop blithering on,

01:30:14.685 --> 01:30:16.585
and I'll actually
read something.
