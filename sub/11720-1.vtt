Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:05.201 --> 00:07.985
I don't think I've ever seen you
this nervous before.

00:07.987 --> 00:09.653
He's your brother.

00:09.655 --> 00:12.273
Welcome home.
Come here.

00:12.275 --> 00:13.591
<i>And the entire time</i>

00:13.593 --> 00:15.026
Michael was in prison,

00:15.028 --> 00:16.277
he never let me visit.

00:16.279 --> 00:17.679
<i>I just never thought</i>
<i>I'd see the day</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:20.664
I'm having breakfast
with his cop girlfriend.

00:22.017 --> 00:23.500
I'm sorry to just drop in
on you like this.

00:23.502 --> 00:24.635
I'm glad you did.

00:24.637 --> 00:26.637
<i>She says she's gonna text</i>

00:26.639 --> 00:28.189
<i>when she lands.</i>

00:28.191 --> 00:30.674
All right, this is her.

00:30.676 --> 00:32.810
Change of plans--
she's not coming.

00:32.812 --> 00:34.645
Kono!

00:36.616 --> 00:39.150
Adam!

00:39.152 --> 00:40.835
<i>The guys who work</i>
<i>for your brother</i>

00:40.837 --> 00:41.652
are gonna want payback.

00:41.654 --> 00:42.937
<i>You need to leave.</i>

00:42.939 --> 00:43.871
I'm going with you.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.740
You can't be serious.

00:45.742 --> 00:48.476
Steve, don't stop her.

00:48.478 --> 00:51.361
Follow your heart.

00:51.363 --> 00:52.496
<i>I'll take good care of her.</i>

00:52.498 --> 00:54.131
<i>I know you will.</i>

00:58.637 --> 01:00.304
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:06.428 --> 01:07.728
Hey, that's funny--
you're the second McGarrett

01:07.730 --> 01:08.813
we've had here in 48 hours.

01:08.815 --> 01:10.164
What do you mean
"second McGarrett"?

01:10.166 --> 01:11.065
Doris McGarrett.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.533
You two related?

01:12.535 --> 01:14.385
You went to see Wo Fat.

01:14.387 --> 01:15.519
Now, why don't you
tell me right now

01:15.521 --> 01:16.887
why you would do
something like that?

01:16.889 --> 01:20.524
Why don't you tell me right
now who he is to you?

01:22.444 --> 01:25.362
<i>You want to know why</i>
<i>your mother paid me a visit.</i>

01:25.364 --> 01:28.032
<i>I can answer that.</i>

01:28.034 --> 01:29.417
But first you're going
to do something for me.

01:29.419 --> 01:30.668
And what's that?

01:30.670 --> 01:32.403
You're going to get me
out of here.

01:32.405 --> 01:33.838
Oh.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.208
Is that so?

01:44.433 --> 01:46.100
You set me up?

01:46.102 --> 01:48.552
Yes, but not
in the way you think.

01:50.505 --> 01:53.057
They're not here
to break me out.

01:53.059 --> 01:55.392
They're here to kill me.

01:55.394 --> 01:57.328
And you're the only one
who can protect me from them.

01:57.330 --> 01:58.846
From who?

01:58.848 --> 02:00.430
Who are they?

Get Wo Fat to a secure location,

03:40.967 --> 03:42.082
then meet me at the Palace.

03:42.084 --> 03:43.367
This one's still breathing.

03:43.369 --> 03:45.586
I'm taking him in
for questioning.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.301
I spoke to Chin.

04:00.303 --> 04:02.719
Told him we'll be
in Zhejiang Province

04:02.721 --> 04:04.888
by the end of the week.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.324
How'd he sound?

04:07.326 --> 04:09.743
Like a man who misses
his best friend.

04:12.447 --> 04:15.249
I'd say we can turn around if
you're having second thoughts,

04:15.251 --> 04:17.250
but...

04:17.253 --> 04:20.788
somehow I don't think
that's an option.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.706
I'm happy right here.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.574
Your whole life's in Hawaii.

04:24.576 --> 04:27.094
And I don't know if
we can ever go back.

04:30.548 --> 04:33.083
Then we start a new one.

04:34.886 --> 04:36.720
You and me.

04:36.722 --> 04:38.622
Us.

04:40.108 --> 04:42.359
This is not
what I wanted for you.

04:45.030 --> 04:48.616
Adam.

04:48.618 --> 04:50.784
What happened with Michael...

04:52.287 --> 04:55.239
...you could have
never seen it coming.

04:57.676 --> 04:59.109
No matter how much
distance we put

04:59.111 --> 05:00.444
between us and what happened...

05:01.779 --> 05:05.416
...the memory's always
going to be there.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.386
I killed my brother.

05:42.587 --> 05:45.155
I love you, cuz.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.295
Aloha.

05:51.297 --> 05:53.497
<i>Malama Pono.</i>

05:56.017 --> 05:57.851
Time to go.

05:57.853 --> 05:59.937
Okay.

06:06.111 --> 06:08.228
What's your name?

06:08.230 --> 06:09.446
We already got your prints.

06:09.448 --> 06:10.680
You might as well tell us.

06:10.682 --> 06:12.983
Who are you?
Who sent you?

06:12.985 --> 06:14.952
You've got a bullet
in your shoulder.

06:14.954 --> 06:17.705
All right, you help me,
I'll get you to a doctor.

06:23.678 --> 06:25.462
Thanks.
So, uh...

06:25.464 --> 06:26.747
I just handed Wo Fat
off to the feds.

06:26.749 --> 06:28.382
They're prepping him,
getting him ready

06:28.384 --> 06:30.167
for his transfer
to a supermax in Colorado.

06:30.169 --> 06:32.102
He say who was
behind the attack?

06:32.104 --> 06:35.139
No, oddly enough, he wasn't,
uh, feeling very chatty.

06:35.141 --> 06:37.341
However, he did want
me to commend you

06:37.343 --> 06:38.258
on your combat prowess.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.176
He said that?

06:39.178 --> 06:40.544
No, it was more
of a look.

06:40.546 --> 06:42.846
So, what were you doing
there in the first place?

06:46.101 --> 06:48.185
Before she left,

06:48.187 --> 06:50.421
my mother went to see him.

06:50.423 --> 06:51.538
I want to know why.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.823
I'm just taking

06:52.825 --> 06:54.408
a wild guess that he didn't
tell you anything.

06:54.410 --> 06:55.976
And Doris is
conveniently unavailable

06:55.978 --> 06:57.494
to give you an answer.

06:57.496 --> 06:58.495
I have my theories.

06:58.497 --> 07:00.080
I just hope they're not right.

07:09.959 --> 07:12.042
Chin, what do you got?
Steve, we got a hit.

07:12.044 --> 07:14.845
The man you're interrogating
is Ricardo Cosi.

07:14.847 --> 07:16.547
He's known to be involved
in drug trafficking,

07:16.549 --> 07:18.348
kidnapping for ransom,
and murder.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.750
He's linked to over

07:19.752 --> 07:22.653
30 National Liberation Movement
actions over the past decade.

07:22.655 --> 07:24.221
This guy's NLM?

07:24.223 --> 07:25.639
I thought we were done
with these guys.

07:25.641 --> 07:27.057
Apparently not.

07:27.059 --> 07:29.309
Ricardo Cosi is
terrorist royalty.

07:29.311 --> 07:31.895
He's the nephew of NLM leader
Esteban Luna,

07:31.897 --> 07:33.564
aka "El Condor."

07:35.400 --> 07:37.434
So, that's why the NLM
went after Wo Fat.

07:37.436 --> 07:39.219
Because he helped us
get Salgado.

07:39.221 --> 07:41.538
And prevent the attack
in San Francisco.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.323
Now they're looking for payback.

07:43.325 --> 07:44.758
This guy's got a blood tie
to the NLM leader,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.126
it means he's gonna have some

07:46.128 --> 07:48.712
serious intelligence value.

08:15.907 --> 08:18.158
<i>Empty your pockets</i>
<i>and step on through.</i>

08:18.160 --> 08:19.843
One at a time, please.

08:19.845 --> 08:22.329
Mahalo. Next.

08:23.282 --> 08:26.016
Excuse me, sir.
Over here.

08:26.018 --> 08:28.202
I'm going to need you
to empty your pockets.

08:31.723 --> 08:33.590
Everybody down!

08:33.592 --> 08:34.541
Everybody...

08:34.543 --> 08:35.542
on the floor!

08:35.544 --> 08:37.294
Face down!

08:37.296 --> 08:38.511
Face down!

08:38.514 --> 08:40.664
Don't make me ask twice.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.099
Let's go--
face down, face down!

08:42.101 --> 08:44.000
- Get down.
- Hey, you...

08:44.001 --> 08:45.135
face down!
Get down!

09:02.262 --> 09:04.397
You two, come on,
move, move, move!

09:05.221 --> 09:06.971
Don't do anything stupid!

09:06.973 --> 09:08.589
Come in, get on the floor.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.608
Shoulder to shoulder,
don't be shy.

09:11.226 --> 09:12.643
Take out your cell phones.

09:12.645 --> 09:14.128
Cell phones!

09:14.130 --> 09:15.596
Hold them in the air.

09:16.815 --> 09:18.900
Heads down.

09:24.073 --> 09:25.706
Chin, hey, what's up?

09:25.708 --> 09:27.091
Steve, we got a situation here.

09:27.093 --> 09:28.359
What kind of situation?

09:28.361 --> 09:30.444
Steve?

09:31.463 --> 09:33.631
Chin?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.623
No service.

10:09.903 --> 10:12.236
<i>Vamos, vamos, vamos,</i>
<i>vamos, vamos.</i>

10:53.379 --> 10:55.296
Gunshots were reported.
Get that barricade up now.

10:55.298 --> 10:59.033
Lock the place off. Make sure
everything's locked down.

11:08.827 --> 11:09.810
Captain Grover,

11:09.812 --> 11:11.996
hell of a week
to start a new job.

11:11.998 --> 11:13.798
Wouldn't have it any other way.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.082
Welcome to Hawaii.

11:15.084 --> 11:16.567
What are our entry points?

11:16.569 --> 11:18.502
We got eight entrances
and exits,

11:18.504 --> 11:22.023
all on the ground floor,
and a fire escape in the back.

11:22.841 --> 11:25.026
Sergeant Lukela,
I'm so sorry.

11:25.028 --> 11:26.744
Is anyone hurt?
Gunshots were reported,

11:26.746 --> 11:28.446
so there could be casualties
among the hostages.

11:28.448 --> 11:29.814
What about Five-O?

11:29.816 --> 11:31.899
Far as we know,
they're still inside.

11:31.901 --> 11:33.084
You can't reach them?

11:33.086 --> 11:34.302
Got no communications.

11:34.304 --> 11:35.419
The phone lines have been cut

11:35.421 --> 11:36.837
and they're jamming
cell phone signals.

11:36.839 --> 11:38.339
Well, whoever they are,
they know what they're doing.

11:38.341 --> 11:40.308
We also confirmed
that all the entrances

11:40.310 --> 11:41.959
have been wired with explosives,

11:41.961 --> 11:44.011
so there's no easy way
in or out.

11:44.013 --> 11:45.079
Like I said,

11:45.081 --> 11:48.716
not your typical hostage-takers.

11:48.718 --> 11:50.601
If these guys have
locked themselves in,

11:50.603 --> 11:53.721
they won't get tired,
hungry or give up.

11:54.556 --> 11:56.590
They came to play.

12:16.995 --> 12:18.963
We are controlling every exit.

12:18.965 --> 12:20.614
He's got to be with Five-O.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.166
Find them.

12:22.168 --> 12:24.218
This goes down the same day
we bring this guy in.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.303
It can't be
a coincidence.

12:25.305 --> 12:26.804
It's got to be a
rescue op, right?

12:26.806 --> 12:28.889
El Condor wants his nephew back?
Oh, I'm very touched.

12:28.891 --> 12:30.641
This guy's leaking.
He's not gonna make it.

13:08.065 --> 13:09.348
Sir?

13:09.350 --> 13:11.567
Lieutenant, there's
a situation at the Palace.

13:11.569 --> 13:13.636
I think you're gonna want
to go down there.

13:28.252 --> 13:30.653
They got every cop
on the island out there.

13:30.655 --> 13:31.871
Good.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.878
You told me you cleared

13:38.880 --> 13:40.346
all the offices.
We did.

13:40.348 --> 13:43.216
It seems you weren't as careful
as you thought.

13:47.437 --> 13:50.039
I'm trapped on the second floor
in the offices of Five-O.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.357
They cut all
the phone lines.

13:51.359 --> 13:52.775
They're jamming
our cell signals.

13:52.777 --> 13:55.194
I think there's more
hiding in the basement.

13:55.196 --> 13:57.713
Please, they'll kill everyone
unless you do something.

13:57.715 --> 13:58.815
You got to help.

13:58.817 --> 14:01.784
We got men here with guns,
wounded hostages.

14:01.786 --> 14:03.853
Please, you got to help us.

14:03.855 --> 14:05.988
I'm trapped on the second floor
in the offices of Five-O.

14:05.990 --> 14:07.290
They cut all the phone lines.

14:07.292 --> 14:09.252
They're jamming our cell
signals. I think there...

14:20.871 --> 14:23.306
Juan.

14:38.105 --> 14:41.073
Excuse me, brah.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:42.726 --> 14:44.277
Whoa, whoa,
that's as far as you go.

14:44.279 --> 14:45.611
You got to let me through.

14:45.613 --> 14:47.079
I got <i>ohana</i> in there.

14:47.081 --> 14:49.732
And we're doing everything
we can to get them out.

14:49.734 --> 14:52.535
But right now,
I need you to wait here.

14:52.537 --> 14:55.087
I'm sorry. Sir,
Don't be sorry. Let me through, brah.

14:55.089 --> 14:56.756
Sir, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

14:56.758 --> 15:00.075
Back off.
You even a cop, brah?

15:00.077 --> 15:02.495
I'm in the academy, <i>brah.</i>

15:02.497 --> 15:06.015
So move along
before I arrest you.

15:06.017 --> 15:09.101
You mean before you call
somebody <i>over</i> to arrest me.

15:10.354 --> 15:13.940
In three months,
you better look out.

15:13.942 --> 15:15.474
90 days.

15:15.476 --> 15:17.643
I'll be waiting.

15:36.297 --> 15:37.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.633
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.335
I considered it.

15:42.337 --> 15:44.503
Oh, you did? Well, do me
a favor, then. Put me out

15:44.505 --> 15:46.188
of my misery.
Did you check the emergency exit?

15:46.190 --> 15:47.590
No, I went to get donuts.

15:47.592 --> 15:49.558
Yeah, I checked the emergency
exit. It's not an option.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.760
They got something rigged
to the door.

15:50.762 --> 15:52.561
It is not... cop friendly.

15:52.563 --> 15:54.697
Steve?
Yeah, thank you. I see.

15:55.849 --> 15:58.300
Come on. Come on.

15:58.302 --> 16:00.803
Buddy, we lose this guy,
we got no leverage.

16:00.805 --> 16:01.988
You're not helping, all right?

16:01.990 --> 16:03.322
Okay. All right.

16:04.024 --> 16:06.141
Okay.
Come on. Come on.

16:07.577 --> 16:09.311
Don't move. I'll be right back.

16:09.313 --> 16:11.414
What'd you say?

16:12.699 --> 16:15.084
Now's not really the time. Um...

16:16.420 --> 16:18.654
Gabby, she's, uh...
she's in town.

16:18.656 --> 16:20.673
All right? And, um, for a minute
there, I thought I was...

16:20.675 --> 16:22.591
I was actually happy.
Which is a weird thing for me

16:22.593 --> 16:24.493
because I don't really know
what that means, but...

16:24.495 --> 16:25.795
you know, I had forgotten
about Kono leaving.

16:25.797 --> 16:27.162
I forgot about Salgado
and his son.

16:27.164 --> 16:28.631
I forgot
about getting shot at.

16:28.633 --> 16:31.667
Again. And then the phone rang.

16:31.669 --> 16:33.386
I had to tell Gabby
I'm going somewhere,

16:33.388 --> 16:35.805
so I turn to her,
and I sit her down and I say,

16:35.807 --> 16:39.358
"Don't move.
I'll be right back."

16:39.360 --> 16:41.110
Instead of what?

16:41.112 --> 16:42.728
DANNY I don't know.
I figure I could've

16:42.730 --> 16:43.929
said something better than that.

16:43.931 --> 16:46.749
Okay, let's hear it

16:46.751 --> 16:47.783
for the Boy Scouts of America.

16:47.785 --> 16:50.936
Nice work, buddy.

16:52.957 --> 16:55.408
Wait a minute.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.660
What were you gonna...
what were you gonna tell her?

16:57.662 --> 16:58.711
You love her or something?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.863
I don't know. I mean, maybe.

17:00.865 --> 17:03.198
Okay. Well, you know what?

17:03.200 --> 17:05.084
Maybe you should be sure--
how about that?--

17:05.086 --> 17:07.036
before you say something
like that to a woman, okay?

17:07.038 --> 17:08.587
Because once you say it,
you can't unsay it,

17:08.589 --> 17:09.558
you understand me?

17:09.583 --> 17:11.058
It's a serious thing.
Uh-huh. I understand.

17:11.059 --> 17:12.207
Are you speaking
from experience?

17:12.209 --> 17:13.559
Because I personally
don't think it counts

17:13.560 --> 17:14.877
when you say it to a pistol.

17:16.213 --> 17:18.013
We got to move.

17:18.016 --> 17:19.898
Get up. You, get up.
Up, up, up.

17:19.901 --> 17:23.402
<i>The drama continues</i>
<i>to unfold at Iolani Palace</i>

17:23.404 --> 17:25.438
with dozens of law enforcement
officers on the scene

17:25.440 --> 17:27.690
of an apparent shooting
and hostage situation.

17:27.692 --> 17:30.192
There has been no
official confirmation,

17:30.194 --> 17:32.411
but sources tell us,
earlier today,

17:32.413 --> 17:34.897
gunfire erupted
inside the Palace

17:34.899 --> 17:37.232
as several armed intruders
forced their way in.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.128
Ah, great.

17:58.106 --> 18:00.940
Looks like you could
use some help.

18:04.895 --> 18:08.013
This has gone on long enough.

18:08.015 --> 18:09.198
Sergeant.

18:13.103 --> 18:16.405
Grover, what
are you doing?

18:16.407 --> 18:17.840
My job.

18:18.909 --> 18:20.993
Seriously, what
are you doing?

18:20.995 --> 18:22.728
Where in the hell
are you going?

18:22.730 --> 18:24.446
Hold up! Hold up!

18:24.448 --> 18:25.881
What's he doing?

18:25.883 --> 18:28.167
We're going in.

18:53.193 --> 18:54.743
What's up?

18:58.181 --> 18:59.949
What do you want?
You fellas hungry

18:59.951 --> 19:01.250
or anything in there?
We're, uh...

19:01.252 --> 19:03.035
thinking about ordering Chinese.

19:03.037 --> 19:05.588
Leave. Now.

19:05.590 --> 19:07.673
No problem.
Listen, if you...

19:07.675 --> 19:10.176
change your mind, though,
let me know.

19:13.096 --> 19:16.132
All right, gentlemen, we have
three hostiles on the floor.

19:16.134 --> 19:19.084
Steyr Tactical Machine Pistols
and extra mags.

19:19.086 --> 19:22.138
Approximately 27 hostages
on the horizontal.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.506
Let's get hot, guys.
We're going in.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.447
Ricardo.

19:39.689 --> 19:42.208
Okay, fine.
You were right.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.542
It worked.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.031
Tomas?

19:53.386 --> 19:54.703
We got about
60 seconds

19:54.705 --> 19:56.472
before they send somebody else
down here.

19:56.474 --> 19:58.390
Come help me with this guy,
will you?

20:01.344 --> 20:04.213
Five-O.

20:05.982 --> 20:07.216
Five-O?

20:07.218 --> 20:09.435
Listen to me.

20:09.437 --> 20:11.270
You're holding
our brother

20:11.272 --> 20:12.771
Ricardo Cosi.

20:12.773 --> 20:14.356
I'll give you
one minute

20:14.358 --> 20:15.758
to return him to me

20:15.760 --> 20:17.276
or I start shooting hostages.

20:17.278 --> 20:18.494
Please.

20:18.496 --> 20:19.561
Just so you know...

20:19.563 --> 20:20.579
No, please.

20:20.581 --> 20:22.815
...I mean what I say...

20:34.594 --> 20:36.078
You.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.547
Up.

20:38.549 --> 20:40.099
Up!

20:40.934 --> 20:42.635
20 seconds.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.525
Ten seconds.

20:53.163 --> 20:54.396
Five seconds.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.033
No. No.

21:17.020 --> 21:18.887
On your knees.

21:35.822 --> 21:37.239
I know...

21:38.491 --> 21:41.076
...there's more than two of you.

21:42.112 --> 21:45.164
That's a really bad idea.

21:48.401 --> 21:50.669
Are you offering
to go first?

21:51.955 --> 21:53.756
Chin.

21:53.758 --> 21:54.990
It's all over.

21:54.992 --> 21:56.091
Get down here.

22:16.196 --> 22:18.347
Tomas?

22:24.571 --> 22:27.189
Ricardo.

22:28.491 --> 22:31.193
<i>¿Está bien?</i>

22:31.195 --> 22:33.028
<i>Gracias.</i>

23:05.912 --> 23:08.330
You're free to arrest us now.

23:26.112 --> 23:27.112
Okay, gentlemen.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.363
Weapons hot.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.565
We're in position, Captain.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.657
We got movement.

23:43.963 --> 23:45.713
Steady.

23:56.676 --> 23:59.377
Take them to federal lockup,
separate cells.

24:02.182 --> 24:05.350
Duke, call the FBI, DHS.

24:05.352 --> 24:06.651
Have them stand by
for debrief.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.736
Commander, how did you
get them to surrender?

24:08.738 --> 24:09.988
I didn't.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.873
Then how is this over?

24:11.875 --> 24:13.158
I don't think it is.

24:14.643 --> 24:16.528
There's more
wounded inside.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.415
It's a through-and-through.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.333
Let's get two large
bore lines in her, stat.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.151
I need her heart rate
and blood pressure.

24:24.153 --> 24:26.504
Gentlemen,

24:26.506 --> 24:29.424
so good to see you.
Oh, we had you worried, Max?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.709
- Not for a moment.
- Oh, you're a very good liar.

24:31.711 --> 24:32.961
We appreciate it, though.

24:34.029 --> 24:36.014
That's one scenario
I hadn't figured on--

24:36.016 --> 24:37.632
executing Cosi
like that.

24:37.634 --> 24:39.350
That guy's
El Condor's nephew.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.636
Why go through all this trouble if you're
just gonna kill him once you get him back?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.760
Cosi's blood tie to El Condor
makes him a liability.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.522
He probably knew everything

24:45.523 --> 24:46.508
there was to know
about this operation.

24:46.509 --> 24:48.415
They needed to make sure
he wasn't gonna talk.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.929
All right, maybe I buy that,

24:49.930 --> 24:52.197
but then why surrender and risk
becoming liabilities yourselves?

24:52.199 --> 24:53.698
Where are they
gonna go? Place is

24:53.700 --> 24:55.466
completely surrounded,
they got nowhere to escape to.

24:55.468 --> 24:57.118
And let's keep in mind,
these guys,

24:57.120 --> 24:58.203
they are
well-trained fanatics--

24:58.205 --> 24:59.938
they have no problem
risking their lives

24:59.940 --> 25:01.656
for their, uh... mission.

25:01.658 --> 25:03.074
I think this mission was more

25:03.076 --> 25:05.343
- than just about Cosi.
- Why? What do you mean?

25:05.345 --> 25:07.962
When I was holed up in HQ,
there were two NLM soldiers

25:07.964 --> 25:09.714
who came and grabbed data
off our drives

25:09.716 --> 25:11.365
before they destroyed
the hardware.

25:11.367 --> 25:13.418
What the hell
were they looking for?

25:15.221 --> 25:16.921
All right, look, we got to move.

25:16.923 --> 25:19.057
Chin, listen, Danny and I are
gonna interview these suspects.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.626
While we do, see what you can do
about reconstructing the drives.

25:21.628 --> 25:23.595
If we can find out what
they were looking for,

25:23.597 --> 25:25.897
maybe we can work out what
their next move is.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.381
You got it.

25:27.383 --> 25:29.150
Catherine, we're fine.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.053
Oh, I am so glad to hear that.

25:32.055 --> 25:33.755
Who is this?

25:33.757 --> 25:35.740
I think you already know.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.742
Where's Lieutenant Rollins?

25:37.744 --> 25:39.827
She will be all right,
Commander,

25:39.829 --> 25:42.914
as long as you do
exactly what I say.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.818
Take a deep breath
and listen very carefully to me.

25:46.820 --> 25:49.537
What I ask of you
is very simple.

25:50.372 --> 25:52.040
I get my people back,

25:52.042 --> 25:54.241
or your girlfriend
will never be seen again.

25:54.243 --> 25:55.677
Don't do it, Steve.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.411
Don't you dare do it!

25:58.882 --> 25:59.881
Catherine!

25:59.883 --> 26:02.133
Catherine!

26:02.135 --> 26:03.217
Don't do it, Steve.

26:03.219 --> 26:04.919
Don't give him any...

26:07.440 --> 26:09.057
What happens to her now
is up to you.

26:09.059 --> 26:10.591
You listen to me.
This only ends one way,

26:10.593 --> 26:12.426
and that's with you dead,
you understand that?

26:12.428 --> 26:14.145
I will call you back
in ten minutes

26:14.147 --> 26:16.731
if my people are not free
by that time.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.866
Well... do I have to state

26:18.868 --> 26:20.985
the obvious?

26:20.987 --> 26:22.236
We got to move.

26:22.238 --> 26:23.788
What the hell's
going on?

26:23.790 --> 26:25.272
No time to explain;
I'll explain on the way.

26:25.297 --> 26:26.942
On the way where?

26:32.115 --> 26:33.881
SWAT Commander. Go.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.750
We're heading eastbound
on King Street.

26:35.752 --> 26:37.719
All right, SWAT van just made
a left on King Street.

26:37.721 --> 26:38.786
We're gonna lose 'em.

26:38.788 --> 26:41.005
Come on, let's go.
Hold on, hold on.

26:49.014 --> 26:50.287
Could we have a little
talk now, please?

26:50.312 --> 26:51.483
A talk about what?

26:51.484 --> 26:53.434
Uh, I don't know, the weather?
I want to talk

26:53.436 --> 26:55.403
about what we're doing.
This isn't the best time, Danny.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.538
See, that's where I disagree.
I think now is the perfect time,

26:57.540 --> 26:58.606
because I would like
to be prepared.

26:58.608 --> 26:59.808
I need to know
what's going on.

26:59.809 --> 27:01.809
I need to know if I need
to put on some extra Kevlar,

27:01.811 --> 27:03.528
need to know if I need
to call my daughter

27:03.530 --> 27:04.746
and say good-bye
for the last time.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.948
We're gonna do
what they asked.

27:05.949 --> 27:07.365
We're gonna release
the prisoners.

27:07.367 --> 27:09.117
That's what we're gonna do,
all right? We talked.

27:09.119 --> 27:10.168
Please understand
that I want to get

27:10.170 --> 27:11.402
Catherine back
just as bad as you do,

27:11.404 --> 27:13.320
but how do we know
they're gonna let her go

27:13.322 --> 27:14.956
if we do what they ask?
We can't.

27:14.958 --> 27:16.524
That's my point!
It's stupid!

27:16.526 --> 27:17.825
We can't do this.

27:17.827 --> 27:19.326
It's not even stupid--
it's beyond stupid.

27:19.328 --> 27:20.828
It's off the goof meter
completely.

27:20.830 --> 27:22.180
It's career-ending,
certifiably...

27:22.182 --> 27:25.099
Okay, okay, will you stop?
Listen to me.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.334
I lost my dad dealing
with people like this;

27:27.336 --> 27:29.020
I'm not gonna lose
Catherine, too.

27:31.339 --> 27:33.558
I-I have your back.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.143
Always, okay?

27:35.145 --> 27:37.028
Thank you.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.697
There it is.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.865
Hold on.

27:56.632 --> 27:58.532
Grover!

27:58.534 --> 27:59.717
Out, out.

28:02.604 --> 28:04.205
What's going on, McGarrett?

28:04.207 --> 28:05.706
Hands in the air.
On your knees.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.541
What are you doing?
Get on your knees!

28:07.543 --> 28:09.710
Don't move, don't move.

28:10.329 --> 28:11.679
Everybody out
of the van!

28:11.681 --> 28:13.881
Out of the van
right now!

28:14.683 --> 28:16.651
Out of the van!

28:16.653 --> 28:18.903
Show me your weapons.
Put 'em on the ground.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.906
Weapons in front of you
on the ground right now.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.524
Weapons in front
of you on the ground.

28:23.526 --> 28:25.026
Sidearms, too.
Let's go, let's go!

28:25.028 --> 28:27.378
You, over here!

28:27.380 --> 28:29.247
On your stomachs.
Hands behind your backs.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.616
McGarrett, what the hell
are you doing, man?

28:31.618 --> 28:32.900
No time. I can't explain.

28:35.637 --> 28:37.404
All right, get out.

28:37.406 --> 28:38.739
Out, out.

28:38.741 --> 28:40.041
Out.

28:44.263 --> 28:47.581
Go. Get out.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.418
So nice to see you again.

28:51.420 --> 28:54.105
If anything happens
to Lieutenant Rollins,

28:54.107 --> 28:56.090
you're the one I kill first.

28:56.092 --> 28:57.625
Can I ask you something?

28:57.627 --> 28:58.743
What?

28:58.745 --> 29:01.896
Are the keys in the Camaro?

29:06.568 --> 29:08.636
You know, you just lost
your badge, McGarrett.

29:08.638 --> 29:09.737
You're all done.

29:09.739 --> 29:12.406
You might be right about that.

29:12.408 --> 29:14.158
All right, it's done.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
You're a smart man, Commander.

29:16.162 --> 29:17.278
Where is she?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.446
History doesn't have
to repeat itself.

29:19.448 --> 29:21.615
I had a feeling
you'd listen to reason.

29:21.617 --> 29:23.968
I just did what you asked.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.454
Now, you tell me where she is.

29:26.456 --> 29:28.005
Let's go.

29:39.518 --> 29:40.818
Catherine.

29:41.637 --> 29:43.404
Catherine?

29:43.406 --> 29:44.639
Catherine?

29:46.241 --> 29:47.775
Catherine!

29:47.777 --> 29:49.143
Hey, Catherine!

29:49.145 --> 29:51.195
Catherine!
This is it.

29:51.197 --> 29:53.281
He said she'd be right here.
We'll find her. Come on.

29:53.283 --> 29:55.216
Catherine?

29:55.218 --> 29:56.951
Catherine, where are you?
Catherine.

30:01.823 --> 30:03.291
Catherine!

30:08.330 --> 30:09.463
Steve.

30:09.465 --> 30:10.497
Catherine!

30:10.499 --> 30:12.633
Catherine!

30:12.635 --> 30:14.302
Steve.

30:14.304 --> 30:16.020
Catherine.

30:19.858 --> 30:20.841
You okay?

30:20.843 --> 30:21.776
Yeah.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.528
You all right?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.179
I'm good. I'm good.

30:32.404 --> 30:34.906
All right,
I'm gonna go, uh...

30:34.908 --> 30:36.908
I'll go wait
by the van.

30:36.910 --> 30:40.161
If anybody needs me,
I'll be over by the, uh...

30:40.163 --> 30:42.463
Ow, wow, look at that--
that's a Giant Amakihi.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.631
I thought these
were extinct, no?

30:43.633 --> 30:46.667
You okay?
Yeah.

30:48.704 --> 30:50.137
You all right?

30:50.139 --> 30:52.423
You shouldn't
have let them go.

30:52.425 --> 30:54.425
Come on, I'm not gonna lose you.

30:54.427 --> 30:56.543
You sure you're okay?
Yeah,

30:56.545 --> 30:58.596
yeah, I'm good,
but you let them get away.

30:58.598 --> 31:00.565
That's what they think.

31:28.961 --> 31:31.379
<i>Vámonos.</i>
Let's go, let's go!

32:04.779 --> 32:07.080
I always figured your driving
is what would kill my car.

32:07.082 --> 32:08.932
Chin, you okay?

32:08.934 --> 32:11.367
Yeah. They must have been
expecting a tail.

32:11.369 --> 32:12.869
This is terrible.

32:12.871 --> 32:16.239
All right, did you see the other
car the guys were driving?

32:16.241 --> 32:17.657
Late model SUV,
black, no plates.

32:17.659 --> 32:19.542
Call Lukela,
have him put out an alert.

32:19.544 --> 32:22.879
Oh, you don't got to do that.
You just... tell him yourself.

32:22.881 --> 32:24.297
All right, geez.

32:25.599 --> 32:27.851
On your knees!
Guns on the ground!

32:27.853 --> 32:29.052
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Down! Down!

32:29.054 --> 32:30.887
Hands where we can see them!

32:30.889 --> 32:33.389
I had no choice.
They had Catherine.

32:33.391 --> 32:36.425
And in exchange,
you released four terrorists.

32:36.427 --> 32:37.427
Yeah, well, I had a plan.

32:37.428 --> 32:38.478
Oh, you had a plan.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.096
Well, where the hell
are they?

32:40.098 --> 32:42.932
Because all I see around here is
an epic fail the size of Texas.

32:42.934 --> 32:44.474
Easy, Captain, before
this gets out of hand.

32:44.499 --> 32:45.269
Look around you.

32:45.270 --> 32:47.537
This has already gotten
way past out of hand.

32:47.539 --> 32:48.905
McGarrett and
his merry band

32:48.907 --> 32:50.323
of do-whatever
the-hell-you-want

32:50.325 --> 32:51.624
should have considered
the repercussions

32:51.626 --> 32:53.977
before jumping me and my men.
Look the only thing

32:53.979 --> 32:55.261
that got hurt
was your pride.

32:55.263 --> 32:58.431
Immunity and means, my ass.

32:58.433 --> 32:59.582
I want you and all your people

32:59.584 --> 33:00.950
to put their weapons
on the ground right now.

33:00.952 --> 33:02.335
Not gonna happen, all right?
This isn't the mainland.

33:02.337 --> 33:04.154
It's Hawaii. We do things a
little differently around here.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.638
So, the more time
we waste,

33:05.640 --> 33:07.123
the more time
the NLM has to escape.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.591
So, what do you want to do?

33:09.560 --> 33:11.845
Those guys escape,
that is on you.

33:11.847 --> 33:13.480
Um, you're invading
his personal space,

33:13.482 --> 33:14.697
which is a bad idea.

33:14.699 --> 33:16.816
You know, see this right here?
We can do this later.

33:16.818 --> 33:18.634
Count on it.
Yeah, good. I'll be there.

33:18.636 --> 33:20.770
Sure thing.

33:23.107 --> 33:25.225
Duke, we're gonna need air
support and roadblocks now.

33:25.227 --> 33:27.476
Let's also call
the Coast Guard, all right?

33:27.478 --> 33:28.495
Anything up
in the air

33:28.497 --> 33:30.196
or in the water
could be our guys.

33:30.865 --> 33:32.749
Duke, what's the matter?

33:32.751 --> 33:35.668
News chopper was reported stolen
this morning.

33:35.670 --> 33:36.836
Didn't even register

33:36.838 --> 33:38.487
with everything that's
going on until now.

33:38.489 --> 33:39.622
It's got to
be connected.

33:39.624 --> 33:42.408
H1 onramp's two blocks
from here, right?

33:42.410 --> 33:43.826
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
where they were headed.

33:43.828 --> 33:44.928
If the NLM is planning

33:44.930 --> 33:46.846
on using this stolen chopper
as a getaway,

33:46.848 --> 33:48.765
there's only one place
I can think of

33:48.767 --> 33:51.134
around here where they could
land and take off again

33:51.136 --> 33:52.769
without drawing too much
attention to themselves.

33:52.771 --> 33:56.139
<i>All units be advised.</i>

33:56.141 --> 33:58.474
Suspect vehicle is a black SUV,

33:58.476 --> 34:00.560
<i>possibly heading</i>
<i>towards Aloha Stadium.</i>

34:00.562 --> 34:02.729
<i>Suspects should be considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

34:12.773 --> 34:14.357
Hold on.

34:36.330 --> 34:37.914
Both hands up!

34:37.916 --> 34:40.016
Hands where we can see them!

34:55.399 --> 34:57.166
Cease fire!

34:57.168 --> 34:58.918
Cease fire!

35:25.029 --> 35:26.929
They're all dead.

35:32.469 --> 35:34.153
We're missing one.

35:35.356 --> 35:36.689
Where's Steve?

36:01.799 --> 36:03.599
<i>Vámonos!  Vámonos!</i>

36:14.779 --> 36:16.329
<i>Rápido!  Rápido!</i>

36:25.122 --> 36:26.139
<i>Vámonos!  Vámonos!</i>

37:51.842 --> 37:53.793
You okay?

37:53.795 --> 37:54.794
Yeah.

37:54.796 --> 37:56.129
Come on.

37:57.915 --> 38:00.099
Come on, Superman.
Okay, you see,

38:00.101 --> 38:02.018
this is the reason I don't like
to fly, because of you.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.103
No, you don't like to fly
'cause you have a fear of fun.

38:04.105 --> 38:06.305
This is fun to you?
This is you having fun?

38:07.357 --> 38:08.825
Did you break anything?

38:08.827 --> 38:10.560
Will you shut up already?

38:10.562 --> 38:12.612
Someday I'm gonna miss this.

38:12.614 --> 38:13.980
All right,
boys, listen.

38:13.982 --> 38:15.281
We've had a long day.

38:15.283 --> 38:18.067
Why don't we, uh,
let HPD do the paperwork,

38:18.069 --> 38:20.203
and let's go grab a beer on me?

38:20.205 --> 38:21.204
Yeah.

38:21.206 --> 38:22.655
What about Captain Grover?

38:22.657 --> 38:23.823
We did our job.

38:23.825 --> 38:25.608
He's got to
get over it.

38:25.610 --> 38:26.826
If he doesn't?

38:27.661 --> 38:29.712
Then we got a problem.

38:31.799 --> 38:33.032
- What else is new?
- Hold on.

38:33.034 --> 38:34.116
Stop for a second.

38:34.118 --> 38:36.052
Did you say free beer?
I did.

38:36.054 --> 38:37.253
What are we doing sitting here?

38:37.255 --> 38:38.638
Would you give me a hand up?

38:38.640 --> 38:40.540
Oh, you want a hand now?
Here, there's your hand.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.675
Give me your hand.
Come on.

38:44.095 --> 38:45.561
Come here.

38:45.563 --> 38:47.129
You want to tell me

38:47.131 --> 38:49.098
how you caught up
with that helicopter?

38:49.100 --> 38:50.817
I was chasing El Condor
across the field

38:50.819 --> 38:52.518
while his guy fired at me.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.303
And then, just as they
were getting away,

38:54.305 --> 38:56.322
they were taking off,
I jumped up and I grabbed

38:56.324 --> 38:57.990
one of the helicopter struts
with my arm.

38:57.992 --> 39:00.610
You know what?
Forget about it.

39:18.795 --> 39:21.714
Commander, you're going
to have to make this fast.

39:21.716 --> 39:22.949
We're wheels-up in five minutes.

39:22.951 --> 39:24.934
I only need two.

39:40.016 --> 39:42.735
Coach is even worse
than I imagined.

39:42.737 --> 39:44.820
Why don't you cut the crap?

39:44.822 --> 39:46.855
I just saved your life.

39:46.857 --> 39:51.077
Now, tell me, why did my mother
come and visit you in prison?

40:01.255 --> 40:03.172
She came to apologize.

40:03.174 --> 40:04.557
Apologize for what?

40:04.559 --> 40:06.726
For killing my father.

40:11.881 --> 40:15.718
You killed her husband--
my father--

40:15.720 --> 40:18.771
and then you hunted her
for 20 years.

40:18.773 --> 40:22.942
Why would my mother ever
apologize to you?

40:25.612 --> 40:28.915
That is a question
only she can answer.

40:28.917 --> 40:30.899
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

40:37.758 --> 40:39.425
What are you doing, Steve?

40:39.427 --> 40:43.963
What do you think
you're going to find?

40:43.965 --> 40:47.049
The truth?

40:47.051 --> 40:49.418
You don't want to
know the truth!

41:02.316 --> 41:04.367
Run this right away.
Against what?

41:04.369 --> 41:06.369
My blood.

41:06.371 --> 41:08.788
I want to know if
Wo Fat's my brother.

41:20.801 --> 41:24.020
Whoa. This is
some heavy stuff.

41:24.022 --> 41:26.522
Should I sign a confidentiality
agreement or something?

41:26.524 --> 41:27.823
No, it's fine.
You tell anybody

41:27.825 --> 41:29.308
what you saw,
I'm gonna shoot you.

41:29.310 --> 41:31.677
Yeah. Okay, that's funny.

41:32.696 --> 41:34.513
I don't think
he was kidding.

41:38.585 --> 41:40.686
Toast, focus.

41:40.688 --> 41:42.989
Oh, here we go.
These are the last commands

41:42.991 --> 41:44.156
that came in just before the NLM

41:44.158 --> 41:46.409
bad boys destroyed
your baby.

41:46.411 --> 41:49.945
Looks like a search request
for satellite data.

41:49.947 --> 41:52.565
Data which was
then transmitted

41:52.567 --> 41:55.067
to an unknown third... party.

41:57.537 --> 41:59.822
What is it?

42:01.058 --> 42:02.758
What were they looking for?

42:15.171 --> 42:16.505
Hello?

42:16.507 --> 42:17.890
Kono, it's Chin.

42:17.892 --> 42:20.109
Listen to me very carefully.
There's been a security breach.

42:20.111 --> 42:21.844
Your location has been compromised.
By who?

42:21.846 --> 42:23.011
The NLM.

42:23.013 --> 42:24.563
We believe they sold
your location to the Yakuza.

42:24.565 --> 42:26.782
You and Adam need to get out
of there right now.

42:26.784 --> 42:28.150
Chin?

42:28.152 --> 42:30.185
Just do it, Kono! Go!

42:31.556 --> 42:32.955
Who was that?

42:32.957 --> 42:34.657
We need to leave now.

42:34.659 --> 42:36.024
What?
Don't pack.

42:36.026 --> 42:37.993
Don't take anything.
Let's just go.

42:39.247 --> 42:41.130
What's going on?
