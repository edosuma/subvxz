[slow footsteps,
floorboards creaking]

00:18.105 --> 00:21.282
I already told you
everything I know.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.808
I don't know
what else you want from me.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.812
WOMAN:
I want the truth.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.338
Real truth.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.514
The one that's
been haunting you,

00:36.558 --> 00:40.866
the one you've been running
from for all these years.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.175
I... I swear to God,

00:45.219 --> 00:48.396
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.530
I don't know
what you want from me!

00:59.015 --> 01:01.061
I know this is
hard for you,

01:01.104 --> 01:05.413
but believe me when I say
I'm actually doing you a favor.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.415
Your shame
holds you back,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.460
keeps you living in pain,

01:09.504 --> 01:11.419
keeps you from being
totally free.

01:11.462 --> 01:14.074
You can do it, Sophie.

01:14.117 --> 01:17.773
You can free yourself.
It's time.

01:17.816 --> 01:20.297
It's time to face the truth.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.999
The crash.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.178
It's my fault.

01:31.221 --> 01:34.659
It's all my fault.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.967
All those people died
because of me.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.447
See?

01:39.490 --> 01:42.102
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

You just...
you leave the door unlocked?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.215
Are you out of your mind?
You live in the Quarter.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.086
Don't bust my chops.
I'm not in the mood.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.132
Do me a favor.
Help me find my keys, please.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.221
Your keys? How are we
gonna find anything in here?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.615
I'm just, I'm saying,
the last time I was here...

03:00.658 --> 03:03.008
The last time you were here,
Sonja was here, too.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.402
It's a lot for me to handle.Yeah, I can see... that.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.275
Is this spinach
or mold right here?

03:08.318 --> 03:11.016
Did Lasalle tell you anything
about the case?

03:11.060 --> 03:13.149
Uh, nothing much. Just that...

03:13.193 --> 03:15.369
Hi.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.761
What's your name?

03:16.805 --> 03:19.329
I... I don't know.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.504
Sebastian.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.245
Your name's Sebastian.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.291
My name is Sebastian.
That's right. Of course.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.031
I forgot. I didn't forget.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.556
It's, um...
What were we talking about?

03:28.599 --> 03:31.080
Looking for these, are you?

03:31.123 --> 03:32.647
Thank you.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.780
My number's on a Post-it
on the fridge.

03:35.824 --> 03:39.175
Wrote my name down, too,
in case you forget again.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.744
It's Brooklyn.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.615
I remember.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.226
Drinks at
the Kerry tomorrow?

03:46.269 --> 03:47.139
I'll try.

03:47.183 --> 03:50.142
Nice meeting you.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.232
Sebastian!

03:55.278 --> 03:57.541
How well do you even know her?Don't give me that tone.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.239
It's none of your business,
and neither is this.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.544
Come on.
Let's go to work.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.677
All right, I ju...

04:02.720 --> 04:05.984
Ugh. What is that, a fig?
What has happened to you?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.906
I just want to make sure
you're all right.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.734
Is there anything wrong
with that?

04:16.778 --> 04:18.649
Other than the fact that that's
all you've been talking about

04:18.693 --> 04:19.998
for the last
45 minutes, no.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.870
All right, it's been
43 minutes, okay?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.133
And my point is that...Listen, I know
what your point is.

04:24.176 --> 04:27.136
And I appreciate it, I really
do, but I'm fine. I am.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.964
Come on, man. How long
have we known each other,

04:29.007 --> 04:30.444
almost two years It seems longer.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.707
You're more of a neatnik freak
than I am, and that is

04:32.750 --> 04:35.013
saying a lot considering
the fact that I am legit OCD.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.320
I know, and you can't let
anything go, including this.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.017
Hey!

04:39.061 --> 04:41.455
Your place was a mess,
the door was unlocked.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.587
Okay? I'm sorry.
That's not like you, and it was

04:43.631 --> 04:46.155
almost as if you had forgotten
that Brooklyn was even there

04:46.198 --> 04:48.462
when we were about
to leave.
Who?

04:48.505 --> 04:50.464
I'm joking. Relax. Hey.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.466
Enough of the grilling,
okay? I've had enough.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.816
I love you, but if you don't
stop, I'm gonna drop you

04:54.859 --> 04:57.340
and turn you into a soprano.
Are we clear?

04:59.603 --> 05:02.214
Crystal.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.610
Victim is Lieutenant
Commander Sophie Kendrick,

05:06.654 --> 05:09.047
pilot out of Pensacola.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.440
Went UA a week ago.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.224
Only found her
'cause a local's hunting dogs

05:12.268 --> 05:13.704
started barking like crazy.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.619
Means whoever brought
her out here obviously

05:15.663 --> 05:17.839
didn't want anybody
finding her for a while.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.450
Didn't want anyone else to hear
the poor girl's screams, either.

05:20.494 --> 05:24.324
Severe bruising,
deep cuts, broken bones.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.022
I'm afraid Commander Kendrick
was brutally tortured

05:27.065 --> 05:29.416
before being asphyxiated.SEBASTIAN:
Well, maybe to get

05:29.459 --> 05:31.505
sensitive information?GREGORIO:
I don't think so.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.202
I mean, enemy combatants

05:33.245 --> 05:35.726
torturing for intel
usually make a mess, right?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.337
Well, look at the floor.
What do you see?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.903
Wood?

05:38.947 --> 05:41.079
No blood.Exactly.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.168
If this is where she was killed,
there'd be a lot more blood.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.083
LASALLE: Means the killer
cleaned up everything.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.434
GREGORIO: But he left the body.
He wanted us to find it.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.261
That means he's got an ego,
and he's cocky,

05:49.305 --> 05:51.263
and doesn't think
he can get caught.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.614
Which would indicate this
is not his first victim.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.181
WADE: Well, he certainly
knew where to cut her

05:56.225 --> 05:58.923
and which bones to
break to maximize pain.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.360
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, but, why?
You know, obviously,

06:00.403 --> 06:02.362
the killer went through
a lot of trouble

06:02.405 --> 06:03.928
to drag his victim way out here.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.540
Yeah, and farmhouses
aren't exactly a dime a dozen.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.238
I mean, bunch of hunting cabins
to choose from,

06:09.281 --> 06:10.500
but he came here.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.241
Well, that in of itself
is a clue.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.851
I mean, maybe
he chose a farmhouse

06:13.895 --> 06:16.071
because it was
something personal.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
If so...

06:17.681 --> 06:20.597
What is it, Gregorio?

06:20.641 --> 06:23.731
Hey, Doc, any chance
the killer used surgical tools

06:23.774 --> 06:26.342
to torture Commander Kendrick,
like a scalpel or something?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.039
As a matter of fact, yes,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.172
several of the wounds
could have been inflicted

06:30.215 --> 06:32.043
by a scalpel. Why?

06:32.087 --> 06:35.307
It's weird.
It's just like... déjà vu.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.875
When I was training
to become a profiler at the FBI,

06:37.919 --> 06:42.053
ten years or so ago,
we had a similar case study.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.969
Found a female doctor
at an abandoned hospital

06:45.013 --> 06:47.798
in Pennsylvania or West
Virginia-- I can't remember.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.278
What about her?

06:49.321 --> 06:51.454
GREGORIO:
She was tortured just like this,

06:51.498 --> 06:55.458
cut with surgical tools
and suffocated, same way.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.984
SEBASTIAN:
They ever catch the guy?

07:00.028 --> 07:02.247
GREGORIO:
Like I said, it was just a case
study, a series of lectures.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.814
Lot of similarities, though.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.337
Too many to ignore.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.078
Can you call
the lecturer?

07:07.122 --> 07:08.689
Yeah. Hopefully,
she's still working

07:08.732 --> 07:10.430
at the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.344
I'll follow up with
Commander Kendrick's C.O.,

07:12.388 --> 07:14.346
see if she had access
to any sensitive intel.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.436
Okay.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.525
Learn everything
you can about her,

07:18.568 --> 07:21.353
backtrack her every last move,
'cause if Gregorio's right,

07:21.397 --> 07:23.704
killer knew a lot
about Kendrick.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.836
Means their lives
intersected somewhere.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.447
Copy that.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.883
Sebastian,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.712
I want you to go over that place
with a fine-tooth comb.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.322
It's hard to believe
that the killer

07:33.365 --> 07:34.932
didn't leave
any trace evidence.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.891
Right, okay, but just, uh, wait.
Just one quick question.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.370
Yeah?

07:38.414 --> 07:40.547
Does Tammy seem
all right to you?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.853
I mean, I'm not trying
to be nosy, and God knows

07:42.897 --> 07:45.116
she's made it very clear that
I should mind my own business,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.336
but, I don't know, I don't think
that's so easy sometimes,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.730
'cause I can be like a dog
with a bone, you know?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.862
When my teeth sink into
something, and then I just

07:51.906 --> 07:53.516
don't let go...Yeah, I'm aware, Sebastian.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.736
Well, I know you're aware.
You've known me long...

07:55.779 --> 07:58.521
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm aware about Gregorio.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.523
Seems a little out
of sorts lately.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.656
Distracted, pressing.Yes, exactly.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.571
Like she was when
she first joined the team.

08:04.614 --> 08:08.444
It could be she's missing Sonja.
They were awful close.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.272
Maybe it's something else.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.361
Anyway, I'll keep
an eye on her.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.841
All right.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.146
GREGORIO:
Professor McDermott?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.974
Oh, my gosh,
it's been so long.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.585
Thanks for taking my call.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.282
I didn't even think
you'd remember me.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.979
Oh, of course I remember you,
Agent Gregorio.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.807
How could I forget?

08:23.851 --> 08:26.593
I remember your fellow agents
were frustrated with you

08:26.636 --> 08:28.246
for asking so many questions.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.597
Oh, right, I forgot.
I was driving them crazy.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.468
Of course, I'm still
driving my agents crazy,

08:32.512 --> 08:34.035
so some things never change.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.384
You still with the Bureau?

08:35.427 --> 08:36.646
No, I'm with NCIS

08:36.690 --> 08:38.039
down in New Orleans?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.431
New Orleans

08:39.475 --> 08:41.216
Yeah, I know,
it's a long way from D.C.,

08:41.259 --> 08:42.522
but you should know
I'm putting everything

08:42.565 --> 08:43.827
you taught me to good use.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.133
Oh, good. I'm glad.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.308
Is that why you're calling?

08:46.351 --> 08:48.005
As a matter of fact, it is.

08:48.049 --> 08:51.008
We have a Navy pilot
who was tortured and killed,

08:51.052 --> 08:53.968
bears a lot of similarities to
that case study on that doctor.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.013
Found in
the Pittsburg hospital?

08:56.057 --> 08:58.189
Yes, exactly.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.887
I mean, we just started
the investigation,

08:59.930 --> 09:02.585
but I was wondering,
was that killer ever caught?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.152
I'd have to check on that.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.067
You think the cases
might be connected?

09:06.110 --> 09:07.590
Like I said, I-I don't know.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.679
Ten years apart,
highly unlikely.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.289
Unless, of course, it turns out

09:11.333 --> 09:13.161
there were more victims
in between.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.119
So, I'm gonna check with
the National Crime Center,

09:15.163 --> 09:17.034
but I was hoping you could
send me your profile

09:17.078 --> 09:17.992
on that first case.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.733
Even if it's not the same guy,

09:19.776 --> 09:21.952
maybe it can help me
get into the head of my killer.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.998
Well, of course.
I'll get right on it.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.695
Thank you so much,
Professor McDermott.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.001
Really nice talking to you.

09:27.044 --> 09:30.831
Oh, please, call me Claire.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.052
SEBASTIAN:
Well, whoever this killer is,

09:35.096 --> 09:36.576
he really knows how
to cover his tracks.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.142
I mean, I scoured every
inch of that farmhouse,

09:38.186 --> 09:39.796
inside and out, twice.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.843
All I got was this rash, which
I really hope isn't ringworm.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.366
Yeah, that makes two of us.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.150
Looks like we're all
coming up empty-handed.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.804
That was Kendrick's C.O.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.067
He said she was
a land-based pilot,

09:50.111 --> 09:52.853
mostly C-130s,
TS clearance.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.638
Nothing foreign entities
would kill for.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.206
Yeah, and I saw nothing
on their air station

09:58.249 --> 10:01.078
surveillance cameras, other than
the last time she left base

10:01.122 --> 10:03.994
and stopped off at a bar,
but nothing suspicious

10:04.038 --> 10:05.996
in Kendrick's phone
or bank records, either.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.650
Doesn't make any sense.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.218
This killer is-is
incredibly meticulous,

10:10.261 --> 10:12.002
not just with the farmhouse,
but with everything.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.222
Even if there was no evidence,
you'd think there would,

10:14.265 --> 10:15.266
there would be a motive.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.224
Yeah, especially
if it's personal.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.399
I mean, killer and her

10:17.442 --> 10:19.053
had to have
crossed paths.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.838
And with the specific intent
not just to kill,

10:21.882 --> 10:23.797
but to torture her, too.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.233
Question is: why?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.756
I don't know
the answer to that,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.671
but I do know she wasn't
his only victim.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.021
Did your BAU guru
connect it to that doctor

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
that was killed
ten years ago?
Not quite.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.285
But I started to do
my own research.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.244
Turns out we're not just
looking at Commander Kendrick.

10:36.287 --> 10:39.464
Melanie Jacobs,
2008, Pittsburg.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.031
Stephanie Benton, A.D.A.,

10:41.075 --> 10:42.642
found in a pharm-plant
near Atlanta in 2009.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.688
2010, a biochemist,
Kelly Mendez,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.125
found in a Denver
school cafeteria.

10:48.169 --> 10:51.999
2011, Claudia Caldwell,
oil CFO in Dallas.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.523
I found ten unsolved murders,
all around the country,

10:54.566 --> 10:56.264
all with the exact same M.O.

10:56.307 --> 11:00.007
All highly successful women,
all tortured and killed.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.791
Yeah.
LASALLE:
At a crime scene

11:01.835 --> 11:03.401
scrubbed clean of any evidence.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.490
Locations are varied, but
there's something unique

11:05.534 --> 11:07.318
about each one.
What's the connection?Yes.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.191
It's got to be to the victims.
Just like the farmhouse

11:10.234 --> 11:11.888
has to be connected
to the pilot.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.150
SEBASTIAN:
So wait. So-so this killer

11:13.194 --> 11:15.109
is taking his victims
and killing them

11:15.152 --> 11:17.111
somewhere that means something
to them?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.808
Yes.This guy's sick.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.331
Yeah, you think?I forwarded everything

11:20.375 --> 11:21.898
to Claire McDermott,
my professor.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.117
If anybody can profile
a killer, it's her.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.206
But I also started
my own profile.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.773
I really don't
think the killer

11:26.816 --> 11:29.384
knew these victims
before they were targeted.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.778
They're just all over the place,
but they're not random.

11:31.821 --> 11:35.042
There has to be a connection.
It-it's maybe the location.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.740
Or, uh, you know,
psychology.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.308
Or maybe the way he
chooses his victims.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.179
I-I haven't gotten
to that part yet,

11:42.223 --> 11:44.660
but I've been, like...Dog, bone.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.748
Huh?
What?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
Hmm

11:47.794 --> 11:50.144
Listen, uh...

11:50.187 --> 11:52.146
Yeah, it's-it's late.

11:52.189 --> 11:55.018
Maybe we should call it a day.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.280
Pick up fresh
in the morning.

11:56.324 --> 11:59.022
No way. I'm on a roll.No, I know. But, uh...

11:59.066 --> 12:02.112
might be better
if we pace ourselves.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.027
After all,
killer's gotten away with this

12:04.071 --> 12:05.115
for over a decade.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.290
It could take a while.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.118
All the more reason
to jump right in.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.164
We'll just pick it up
in the morning.No.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.560
Okay.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.048
GREGORIO: I'm just glad somebody cares about this case.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.355
Thanks for getting back to me
so quickly.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.792
CLAIRE:
I'm not sure I can help much.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.055
I mean, each case,
each crime scene

12:32.099 --> 12:34.449
is so wildly different.

12:34.492 --> 12:38.322
I... can't seem to come up
with a profile.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.454
Can you?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.369
I've been working on it.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.371
It's clear that the killer
somehow sees himself

12:43.414 --> 12:44.676
in his victims.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.288
CLAIRE:
Maybe it's a power dynamic.

12:47.331 --> 12:51.118
Maybe he's torturing his victims
out of some sort of...

12:51.161 --> 12:53.598
Oedipus complex.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.384
Except there's nothing sexual
about the tortures or murders,

12:56.427 --> 12:59.082
which might suggest
the killer's a woman,

12:59.126 --> 13:00.780
which also might explain
how she's gotten away with it

13:00.823 --> 13:01.998
for so long.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.827
Interesting.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.481
Go on.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.178
Well, according to
the case files,

13:08.222 --> 13:10.311
the killer broke into
each victim's home first

13:10.354 --> 13:13.183
to probably try
to get to know them better,

13:13.227 --> 13:15.098
you know, get into their heads.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.839
Fits the codependent profile.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.189
Yes. Which is why
I think the killer

13:19.233 --> 13:22.236
identifies with her victims
in a twisted sort of way,

13:22.279 --> 13:24.891
tortures them because
she's somehow tortured herself.

13:27.371 --> 13:31.593
I think you may be
onto something.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.913
♪

14:14.418 --> 14:16.725
LASALLE:
Anything out of place at all?

14:16.768 --> 14:18.770
You mean other than
everything?

14:18.814 --> 14:20.511
I got to get
a housekeeper.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.383
Gregorio, why don't you just
take a seat, let us handle...

14:22.426 --> 14:24.080
For the last time,
Lasalle, I'm fine. Okay?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.777
I-I'm allowed to be
a little creeped out

14:25.821 --> 14:27.170
by someone being
in my house, right?

14:27.214 --> 14:29.303
You sure she was even here?Yes, I'm sure.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.914
I was talking to her when
I heard the sirens on the phone.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
I just missed her.
Claire doesn't leave evidence.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.309
Remember?

14:35.352 --> 14:37.528
Yeah, well, someone
training FBI agents--

14:37.572 --> 14:39.922
I guess if anybody knows
how to get away

14:39.966 --> 14:41.924
with something like this...Everything about her
fits the profile.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.926
She's brilliant, she knows how
to get into people's heads,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.407
and she's ballsy enough to teach
a class on her first victim.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.930
I can't believe

14:47.974 --> 14:49.845
she all but taunted us
into telling us it was her.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.761
Well, there's no
trace evidence outside,

14:52.804 --> 14:54.197
at least none
that I could find.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.416
There's a camera
on the street corner,

14:55.459 --> 14:56.721
but I'm guessing
she knew to avoid it.

14:56.765 --> 14:57.897
PRIDE:
All right, thanks,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.072
but get that alert out
right away.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.465
Okay, that was Quantico.

15:01.509 --> 15:05.165
Seems Claire McDermott
left her FBI office

15:05.208 --> 15:06.775
right after you
called her yesterday.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.038
Gives her enough time to
catch a plane to New Orleans.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.387
You must have spooked her.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
Guess I should be
flattered she thinks

15:11.911 --> 15:13.347
I'm smart enough to catch her.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.131
Except now that means
that you're her next target.

15:15.175 --> 15:16.654
I mean, didn't you say
that the killer

15:16.698 --> 15:18.787
broke into victims' homes
before...
Yeah, he's right.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.659
I mean, it breaks the pattern
of her killing a victim a year,

15:21.703 --> 15:23.835
but assuming she thinks
I'm onto her...

15:23.879 --> 15:25.750
Yeah.
All the more reason

15:25.794 --> 15:29.058
to figure out what she was
looking for, or what she found.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.887
Yeah, easier said than done.
God...

15:31.931 --> 15:33.802
Look, Tammy...

15:33.845 --> 15:36.283
Yeah.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.024
I think you should
stay put.
No.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.591
No, you can't do this
to me, Pride.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.853
You can't bench me.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.638
You need a profiler
to catch a profiler.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.248
I'm the only one.
I know.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.468
But you can just as easily
do that from here.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.860
Come on.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.775
With NOPD out front,
Sebastian inside,

15:50.819 --> 15:52.647
at least you'll be safe.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.779
Plus, I can remotely access
the squad room from here.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.912
Check city surveillance,
do a digital search for Claire.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.870
Start with the airport,
track her from there.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.047
All right.Best way for you to help us

16:01.090 --> 16:03.527
is for you to
get into her head.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.528
Understood?

16:04.572 --> 16:05.660
Yeah.Here's your file.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.618
Thank you.And get started.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.273
Okay.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.927
Looks like Loretta
might have found something.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.408
Chris, you're with me.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.975
We got you.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.983
Do not let her
out of your sight.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.341
LORETTA:
Tammy should be concerned.

16:34.384 --> 16:37.213
I'm concerned, considering
what that monster did

16:37.257 --> 16:39.824
to this poor woman,
and all the other women, too.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.566
Don't worry, we're not gonna
let anything happen to Gregorio.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.004
Her place is surrounded
by NOPD.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.570
Plus, Sebastian's right there
by her side.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.659
Still, the sooner I can
help you find

16:48.703 --> 16:50.661
this Professor McDermott,
the better.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.924
Why we're here.
You said you found something.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.666
Yeah.
Tammy was right.

16:55.710 --> 16:59.018
Looking at all ten victims,
including Commander Kendrick,

16:59.061 --> 17:03.457
I found evidence that shows
that each one was tortured

17:03.500 --> 17:05.067
with the same tools,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.938
including a very
specific scalpel.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.462
Specific in what way?

17:08.505 --> 17:11.508
Each surgical scalpel has
a distinctive purpose to it.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.468
The killer used one that was
intended for long incisions.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.339
It's leaf-shaped, curved,

17:16.383 --> 17:19.342
and, in this case, sharpened
on the leading edge only,

17:19.386 --> 17:22.519
which accounts for those
scalloped torture wounds.

17:22.563 --> 17:26.306
Still, if we don't find the
scalpel, it wont help us any.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.047
Only way to do that
is to find Claire

17:28.090 --> 17:29.135
before she gets to Gregorio.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.658
If she still does--

17:30.701 --> 17:32.573
whenshe does--

17:32.616 --> 17:36.490
she'll probably try
to drug Tammy with Rohypnol.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.882
Roofies?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.841
Yes. I found trace evidence

17:39.884 --> 17:41.973
in each one
of the victims' blood.

17:42.017 --> 17:45.238
She probably drops them
in their drinks,

17:45.281 --> 17:47.153
tranquilizes them
so she can take them

17:47.196 --> 17:49.111
to wherever the hell
she takes them to.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.896
Commander Kendrick was
last seen at a bar.

17:53.724 --> 17:57.163
[pop music playing,
lively chatter]

17:57.206 --> 17:59.861
You're Brooklyn, right?Yes.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.559
Your friend Tammy just called.
Apologizes for running late.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.213
Enjoy.Thanks.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.612
You know Tammy?

18:11.655 --> 18:14.484
Tammy Gregorio?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.573
Uh, yeah.
How do you know her?

18:16.617 --> 18:18.880
Former professor.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.795
I actually trained her
at the FBI.

18:20.838 --> 18:24.886
Wait, she's a cop?
I had no idea.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.063
Tammy has a lot
of little secrets.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.413
Trust me.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.502
Mind if I join you
while you wait?

18:32.546 --> 18:35.636
Sure. I'm Brooklyn.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.465
Nice to meet you, Brooklyn.
I'm Claire.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.944
Cheers.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.339
Cheers.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.220
SEBASTIAN:
What do you think she gets
out of torturing her victims?

18:54.263 --> 18:56.700
I mean, I'm no profiler,
but it feels like if we can

18:56.744 --> 18:58.833
figure out what Claire
gets out of it, then...

18:58.876 --> 19:00.704
Might be easier to do
if we could figure out

19:00.748 --> 19:03.142
why she brings her victims
to such specific locations.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.144
Yeah, and then goes
all Buffalo Bill on them

19:05.187 --> 19:06.319
when she gets them there.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.364
Who?
Silence of the Lambs?

19:08.408 --> 19:10.279
Oh, yeah.
You've never seen
Silence of the Lambs?

19:10.323 --> 19:11.715
Isn't that, like,
basic training at the FBI?

19:11.759 --> 19:12.890
No, I don't do
creepy movies.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.501
Okay.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.329
Oh, it's Brooklyn.
She wants me to call her.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.808
Yeah, so call her.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.549
I mean, didn't you say you
were gonna meet up with her?

19:19.593 --> 19:20.942
No, I said I'd try.
Besides, I'm a little busy.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.291
Somebody's trying to kill me.
Remember?

19:22.335 --> 19:24.163
I mean, you're being
a little dramatic.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.295
Don't you think?
Just call her up.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.167
If you don't, I will.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.430
And I'll somehow convince her
to be attracted to me.

19:30.473 --> 19:31.866
Oh?
Yeah.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.222
Hey, it's kind of
a bad time right now,

19:40.266 --> 19:41.832
so maybe we could
hook up later...

19:41.876 --> 19:43.747
CLAIRE:
Go out onto your balcony.

19:43.791 --> 19:47.360
Otherwise, your lady friend
becomes victim number 11.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.665
You don't really want to be

19:48.709 --> 19:51.581
responsible for her,
too, do you?

19:54.584 --> 19:56.412
Hey, I'm gonna
take this outside.

19:56.456 --> 19:59.198
I'll go outside.No, no. Relax, I'm fine.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.378
What do you want?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.771
I want to help free you, Tammy.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.774
What does that mean?
I want to talk to Brooklyn.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.212
Only because I have her.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.344
You were gonna
stand her up, weren't you?

20:15.388 --> 20:17.912
Because you can't
let people get too close.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.914
I wonder why.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.264
Lose your partner,
get in your car

20:22.308 --> 20:25.833
and drive, or you will have
one more reason to

20:25.876 --> 20:27.704
never forgive yourself.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.489
Okay.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.322
Hey.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.806
Tammy?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.724
Tammy!

21:01.390 --> 21:02.957
Sebastian.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
I never should have let her
out of my sight, okay, I know.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.003
It's just, she was gone
for a couple seconds...

21:06.047 --> 21:07.875
All right, calm down
and tell me what happened.

21:07.918 --> 21:10.486
She got some sort of a text
from this woman-- uh, Brooklyn.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.966
They were supposed
to go out for drinks.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.924
So Tammy called her, she
went out on the balcony

21:13.968 --> 21:15.491
to say that she
couldn't make it,

21:15.535 --> 21:17.493
and the next thing
I know, she's gone.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.104
Well, it has to be Claire.

21:20.148 --> 21:23.325
Must have taken Brooklyn
to get to Gregorio.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.935
And she knew where
Brooklyn was gonna be

21:24.979 --> 21:25.936
from when she was
snooping around.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.938
God, it's...
Why didn't Tammy

21:27.982 --> 21:30.201
tell me that Claire
was on the phone instead?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.247
Or why didn't she give me
some kind of, uh, a signal?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.249
Probably was worried
she might risk

21:34.293 --> 21:35.946
Brooklyn's life if she did.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.121
Claire must have
known that

21:37.165 --> 21:39.341
Gregorio wouldn't take
that risk.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.561
Yeah, well, I tried
tracking Tammy's cell phone

21:41.604 --> 21:42.866
and her car's GPS.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.260
Nothing.
Neither one's working.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.437
Listen to me, Sebastian.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.874
We're gonna
find her.

21:50.918 --> 21:51.919
Okay?
Yeah.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.137
But only if we focus.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.226
Only if we work this

21:55.270 --> 21:56.489
like any other case.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.881
You understand?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.972
Yeah. Okay.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.844
What do you want to do?

22:03.887 --> 22:06.977
The first thing we do
is trust Gregorio.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.937
She's trained,
she knows who she's up against.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.375
She'll do everything
she can to buy us time.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.159
Did you put a BOLO out
on her car?

22:15.203 --> 22:17.684
Only the second
I saw it was gone.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.512
Good. Let's gather up
these files.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.906
PRIDE: Claire's
profile, too. We know

22:22.950 --> 22:24.952
she usually looks for
some psychological connection

22:24.995 --> 22:26.693
to her victims,
which means,

22:26.736 --> 22:30.044
assuming she stays on pattern,
if we can figure out

22:30.087 --> 22:33.526
how Claire thinks she can
connect to Gregorio...

22:33.569 --> 22:35.179
Right. Then, we can figure out
where she's gonna take her.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.920
All right. Just...

22:36.964 --> 22:38.661
Means we got
to profile Tammy, too.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.359
You know, that just feels weird.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.361
It's not if it's the only way
to save her life.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.623
Come on.

22:48.454 --> 22:51.195
CLAIRE: Stay on the 90
till you cross the river.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.546
You following me?

22:53.589 --> 22:55.069
CLAIRE:
All those years training agents,

22:55.112 --> 22:58.028
you don't think I know
how to track somebody?

23:00.074 --> 23:02.859
Just keep driving,
I'll tell you where to turn.

23:02.903 --> 23:06.254
How do I know Brooklyn's
still alive?

23:06.297 --> 23:09.388
Because you're a better
profiler than that.

23:09.431 --> 23:14.044
You know I choose for my girls
for specific reasons.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.481
Besides, I think
you wouldn't want to make

23:15.524 --> 23:17.308
the same mistake twice.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.093
What's that supposed to mean?

23:19.136 --> 23:22.096
Let's just say I found

23:22.139 --> 23:25.882
more than Brooklyn's
phone number in your apartment.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.449
You know what?

23:27.493 --> 23:28.450
You're sick.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.973
You need help.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.627
I read up on you, all right?

23:31.671 --> 23:32.889
I know.

23:32.933 --> 23:36.023
This is not about me!

23:36.066 --> 23:38.895
This is about you, Tammy.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.593
Now, toss your phone
out the window

23:40.636 --> 23:42.246
so your team can't track you.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.901
Go on.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.990
I can see your GPS
is still moving.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.818
Now, you wouldn't want me
to kill Brooklyn over it

23:48.862 --> 23:50.733
and have to live with that,
would you?

24:08.534 --> 24:10.405
I'm listening.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.755
What do you want?

24:12.799 --> 24:16.150
I'm sorry, this-this
just feels really icky.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.717
Did you guys know that Tammy

24:17.760 --> 24:19.458
once called the cops
on her father?

24:19.501 --> 24:20.981
Any luck with that BOLO?

24:21.024 --> 24:22.809
Nah, nothing.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.202
Wherever Claire is taking
Gregorio, she's obviously using

24:25.246 --> 24:27.117
every skill she has
to avoid cameras.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.163
Stay on top of the
alerts, though: NOPD,

24:29.206 --> 24:31.078
LSP, traffic, anything.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.645
I'm on it.Sebastian,

24:32.688 --> 24:35.256
find anything useful
in Gregorio's profile

24:35.299 --> 24:37.040
on the killer

24:37.084 --> 24:40.000
It's just-- it's not
my area of expertise.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.349
I-I'm trying to cross-reference
what we have

24:41.392 --> 24:43.177
on Claire, and the victims,

24:43.220 --> 24:45.179
but honestly, I don't
even know where to start.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.876
I don't, either.
But there's got to be

24:46.920 --> 24:49.705
something meaningful
to Gregorio, right?

24:49.749 --> 24:51.446
Something personal.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.752
CLAIRE: Troubled relationship
with your mother,

24:52.795 --> 24:54.884
father abandoned you both,

24:54.928 --> 24:56.886
died while you were in college.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.107
He didn't abuse you,
did he, Tammy?

25:00.150 --> 25:02.544
Look, I'm doing what you ask,
I'm following directions.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.328
I don't need to deal
with this crap.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.853
Got married young,
tried to get away from it all?

25:06.896 --> 25:09.333
That didn't work either,
did it?

25:09.377 --> 25:15.339
Con man husband gets busted,
so you run off and join the FBI,

25:15.383 --> 25:17.124
try to make up for it all.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.126
Ten years later,
your life's a wreck again.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.736
Do you want to know why?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.912
Hey, how about we talk about
you, instead, Claire, huh?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
Because we both know
you're a hell of a lot

25:24.610 --> 25:26.220
more screwed up than I am.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.875
Because you're still
running, Tammy.

25:28.918 --> 25:32.400
You are still running
from that day,

25:32.443 --> 25:36.578
and until you stop
and feel the pain,

25:36.622 --> 25:38.928
you're just gonna keep running,

25:38.972 --> 25:41.888
keep being lonely.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.325
Turn left
after the next intersection.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.818
Turn now.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.081
Stop the car at the gate,
start walking.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.800
LASALLE:
King, I got something.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.454
Gregorio's license plate

26:26.497 --> 26:28.456
just popped up
on photo enforcement.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.676
She just ran a red light
at Airline Drive and Central

26:30.719 --> 26:32.242
ten minutes ago.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.723
She's leaving us a trail.Chris, let's move.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.725
Sebastian,
you stay here,

26:36.769 --> 26:40.642
let us know if Gregorio tries
to send us any more signals.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.296
Hold on, I want
to go with you guys.I know you do,

26:42.339 --> 26:44.124
but we'll bring her back.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.959
Lift up your shirt.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.221
Slowly.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.657
Turn around.

26:55.701 --> 27:00.140
Want to make sure
you're not carrying.

27:00.183 --> 27:03.273
Where's Brooklyn?

27:03.317 --> 27:05.754
She's safe,
as long as you do what I say.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.322
What are you gonna do,
torture me

27:08.365 --> 27:10.237
No.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.282
I'm gonna free you.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.416
Drink this.

27:18.288 --> 27:21.465
Yeah, I'm not drinking anything

27:21.509 --> 27:23.467
until I see
that Brooklyn's all right.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.818
Drink it.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.690
Would you stop? We both know
you're not gonna shoot me,

27:28.734 --> 27:31.040
because that's not what you do,
but you're gonna have to

27:31.084 --> 27:33.347
if you don't show me
Brooklyn's all right.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.914
Right now.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.399
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

27:42.443 --> 27:43.531
All right? I'll
take care of it.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.361
How do I know you'll let her go?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.493
Because I don't care about her.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.712
You do.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.888
That's why you came.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.281
And you couldn't bear

27:54.324 --> 27:56.152
to run away from somebody
that needed help,

27:56.196 --> 27:58.415
like you did
all those years ago in Hawaii.

28:00.896 --> 28:04.421
Do you remember Hawaii, Tammy?

28:06.380 --> 28:08.338
How do you even know about that?

28:31.797 --> 28:33.581
Clear.

28:34.234 --> 28:35.801
It's Gregorio?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.237
No.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.629
Here, okay. All right, hey.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.631
Hey, it's all right,
we're federal agents.

28:40.675 --> 28:41.763
All right

28:41.807 --> 28:42.982
I'm gonna take this off.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.635
Oh, my God, Tammy,
you got to find Tammy.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.202
Tammy, where is she?
Do you know?

28:46.246 --> 28:47.551
Did the same woman
who took you take her?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.118
Yes, and she's gonna kill her.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.467
I know she's gonna kill her.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
[rustling,
fluttering sounds echo]

29:17.886 --> 29:19.888
Wait.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.937
Where am I...?

29:28.505 --> 29:29.855
Don't worry.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.900
Claire...The dizziness and nausea

29:31.944 --> 29:34.163
will wear off; after all,

29:34.207 --> 29:35.643
I need you
clearheaded.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.474
Look, I don't know what
you think you're gonna do to me.

29:40.517 --> 29:45.087
Actually, I know exactly
what I'm going to do to you.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.872
What?

29:46.915 --> 29:48.874
GREGORIO:
You sick bitch.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.137
Killing me isn't
gonna free me.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.356
This isn't about me,
this is about you,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.750
and whatever demented crap
you get out of it.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.404
Denial is defense.

29:57.447 --> 29:58.709
Denial?!

29:58.753 --> 30:00.189
But there are tools

30:00.233 --> 30:03.366
to break down the walls
we create to protect ourselves

30:03.410 --> 30:04.628
from our deepest pains.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.413
Somebody! Somebody, help me!

30:06.456 --> 30:09.503
Somebody, help me, please!Nobody can hear you.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.767
I made sure to rent out all the
rooms on this side of the motel.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.290
Motel Why?

30:14.334 --> 30:16.597
To help remind you,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.555
to bring you back
to the pain of that day.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.341
Please, Claire...And since the same
area of the body...

30:21.384 --> 30:23.169
Let's just talk....are activated...

30:23.212 --> 30:24.431
Let's just talk....by both physical...

30:24.474 --> 30:25.998
Claire, please, don't....and emotional pain...

30:26.041 --> 30:27.129
Claire! Don't do it, please.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.217
No! Claire!

30:28.261 --> 30:30.829
No! No...!

30:34.484 --> 30:36.617
BROOKLYN:
Sorry, I can't remember much

30:36.660 --> 30:38.140
after I met her at the bar.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.402
But you can ID her, right?

30:39.446 --> 30:40.534
Claire McDermott?

30:40.577 --> 30:41.796
The photo I
showed you?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.016
Yes. Absolutely.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.887
Uh-- oh, it's all right, dear.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.107
This is for under
your fingernails.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.717
I'm just trying to get

30:49.760 --> 30:53.025
any evidence I can
to help Agent Pride

30:53.068 --> 30:54.765
find Tammy.

30:54.809 --> 30:57.768
I know you've been
through a lot,

30:57.812 --> 30:59.901
but if you saw anything,

30:59.945 --> 31:03.035
or heard anything while
you were with Claire,

31:03.078 --> 31:05.515
where she took you, where
she might be taking Tammy?

31:05.559 --> 31:08.257
I woke up in the trunk.

31:08.301 --> 31:12.044
She told me not to make
a sound, or she'd kill me.

31:12.087 --> 31:16.526
PRIDE: Still, if there's
anything that you can remember,

31:16.570 --> 31:19.442
i-it'll help,
regardless of

31:19.486 --> 31:22.010
how insignificant
you might think.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.664
Um...

31:23.707 --> 31:28.799
I-I saw some... plastic sheeting

31:28.843 --> 31:30.018
in the trunk,

31:30.062 --> 31:33.152
and gray tape.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.241
PRIDE:
Anything else?

31:37.983 --> 31:43.162
Brooklyn, Tammy left
Agent Pride a signal before.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.555
That's how he was able
to find you.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.556
We're hoping

31:46.600 --> 31:47.470
she might've left

31:47.514 --> 31:49.168
another sign,

31:49.211 --> 31:50.560
said something.

31:50.604 --> 31:54.042
Claire said something to Tammy.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.044
A-About Hawaii.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.828
Hawaii. What about Hawaii?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.787
I don't know.

31:59.830 --> 32:02.659
But it sounded like maybe
something had happened

32:02.703 --> 32:04.923
to Tammy a long time ago.

32:04.966 --> 32:09.101
Uh... She said,
"Remember Hawaii."

32:09.144 --> 32:11.364
D-Does that
mean anything?

32:11.407 --> 32:13.105
We might have something.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.630
Excuse me.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.069
So we went through the
case files of all the victims

32:21.113 --> 32:22.897
trying to find something
personal that connects them,

32:22.941 --> 32:24.986
like what Tammy
talking about.Which got us thinking,

32:25.030 --> 32:27.206
she also said Claire takes
her victims to places

32:27.249 --> 32:28.903
that mean
something to them.
And?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.166
Well, our Navy pilot,
Commander Kendrick,

32:31.210 --> 32:32.994
she was killed
at a remote farmhouse.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.214
Yeah, and five years ago,
she was flying a C-130

32:35.257 --> 32:36.606
that had to make an
emergency landing.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.130
She crashed
into a farmhouse.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.654
Seven sailors survived,
but three didn't.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.003
And even though
the Navy cleared her

32:42.047 --> 32:44.005
of any wrongdoing...She still blamed herself.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.267
Yeah, she's not
the only one, either.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.965
Each and every one
of the victims

32:47.008 --> 32:49.097
had some traumatic event
happen in their past, too.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.491
And each one of the murders
was in the locations

32:51.534 --> 32:53.275
that matched where their
traumas took place.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.844
So, what? Claire's trying
to somehow force her victims

32:56.887 --> 32:59.934
to face their past by torturing
and killing them?

32:59.978 --> 33:00.979
I'm guessing that has more to do

33:01.022 --> 33:02.371
with Claire than
with her victims.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.069
More importantly, she must know
whatever happened

33:04.112 --> 33:06.201
in Gregorio's past
that's haunting her.Yeah, and if we can

33:06.245 --> 33:08.073
figure that out, we might
be able to find her,

33:08.116 --> 33:11.728
but we're running out of time.
Any idea what it could be?

33:11.772 --> 33:13.600
We got to get back
to that apartment.

33:18.648 --> 33:22.739
Why are you fighting
this so hard?

33:22.783 --> 33:24.654
You know you're only
hurting yourself.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.831
The physical pain is meant
to reveal the inner pain,

33:27.875 --> 33:30.182
all you have to do is face it.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.099
You're the only one
who's not facing it.

33:34.142 --> 33:39.408
No matter what I say,
no matter what you make me say,

33:39.452 --> 33:41.845
nothing will
stop the pain

33:41.889 --> 33:43.195
you're running from.

33:43.238 --> 33:45.980
Really?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.243
Yeah.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.853
I read your file.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.204
I profiled you, too.

33:52.247 --> 33:56.556
Daddy beat you
one too many times, huh?

33:59.559 --> 34:02.605
Kindly Dr. McDermott
wasn't so kindly.

34:05.826 --> 34:10.004
April 24, 1991,

34:10.048 --> 34:12.267
somebody stabbed your
father and killed him.

34:12.311 --> 34:15.270
Wasn't you, was it,
now, Claire?

34:17.359 --> 34:21.015
Is that why you
do what you do?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.365
Is that why you
hurt innocent people?

34:23.409 --> 34:25.759
Because that son of
a bitch hurt you?

34:27.195 --> 34:30.285
God!

34:30.329 --> 34:33.767
This is about what you
are running from, Tammy.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.248
What you'renot facing.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.727
Not me.

34:42.384 --> 34:46.606
Now let's talk about
July 12, 1998,

34:46.649 --> 34:48.347
shall we?

34:48.390 --> 34:50.131
Let's talk about what you did--

34:50.175 --> 34:53.265
or, rather, didn't do--
in Maui that day.

34:56.268 --> 35:00.794
I can't find anything about
Hawaii anywhere, can you?

35:00.837 --> 35:03.188
Not yet. We just got
to keep looking.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.667
I hate to bring
it up, King,

35:04.711 --> 35:06.408
but, uh, what if we're
wrong about Claire?

35:06.452 --> 35:10.195
And what if Brooklyn didn't
remember things correctly?

35:10.238 --> 35:12.284
We could lose Gregorio.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.937
SEBASTIAN:
All right, no, I...

35:13.981 --> 35:15.809
I can't let that happen, okay?
So there's-there's

35:15.852 --> 35:17.811
there's got to be an answer here
somewhere.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.856
Okay. Okay.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.163
Scrapbook.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.035
Where's the scrapbook?

35:25.079 --> 35:27.168
What're you talking about,
Sebastian?

35:27.212 --> 35:28.474
When I came here
to pick up Tammy for the case,

35:28.517 --> 35:30.606
I was looking through
this-this pink scrapbook

35:30.650 --> 35:32.304
and it had pictures
of Hawaii in it.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.522
She-she whipped it
out of my hands,

35:33.566 --> 35:34.654
says it wasn't
any of my business

35:34.697 --> 35:35.959
and then she put it right there,

35:36.003 --> 35:37.309
and it's gone.

35:37.352 --> 35:38.527
Well, maybe Claire took it.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.356
LASALLE:
Or maybe she hid it,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.750
where we couldn't find it
in time. Here it is.

35:43.793 --> 35:44.838
Yes, that's it.

35:47.797 --> 35:50.626
SEBASTIAN: But what would
Claire want with this?

35:50.670 --> 35:52.411
LASALLE: Looks like Gregorio
from high school.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.935
Yeah, with a friend, too.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.589
Look, all these ones
are her and a friend.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.592
Andrea Ortiz.
Says Andrea was abducted

35:59.635 --> 36:02.334
and murdered while
vacationing in Hawaii

36:02.377 --> 36:06.512
with her family and best friend,
Tammy Gregorio.

36:06.555 --> 36:11.038
She kept all the articles
during the investigation.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.606
Look, Andrea was
found in a motel,

36:13.649 --> 36:16.391
but the killer was never caught.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.524
Yeah, well, looks like Tammy
never stopped looking.

36:18.567 --> 36:22.223
Because somehow
she blames herself...

36:22.267 --> 36:24.791
and now, Claire knows it.

36:29.448 --> 36:32.538
Look at Andrea.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.757
Look at her.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.063
Leave me alone.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.630
This is what you've been
running from, Tammy,

36:37.673 --> 36:40.023
for your whole life. This is why
you can't let anybody in.

36:40.067 --> 36:43.853
This is why you
don't deserve it.

36:43.897 --> 36:47.770
Say it, Tammy, let it go.
Say it.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.816
Why didn't you
do something?

36:51.557 --> 36:53.559
I didn't know.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.693
What didn't you know?

37:01.262 --> 37:03.221
We went out.

37:05.353 --> 37:08.704
And I didn't tell our parents.

37:08.748 --> 37:12.142
And she met a guy
and left with him.

37:12.186 --> 37:15.189
And you let her?

37:15.233 --> 37:18.671
I should've told her parents.
I should've done something.

37:18.714 --> 37:22.414
But I was afraid,
I was afraid

37:22.457 --> 37:24.677
we'd get in trouble. I do...

37:26.505 --> 37:30.378
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.294
:
Andrea, I'm so sorry.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.861
Forgive me.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.479
Good girl, Tammy.

37:47.482 --> 37:49.876
Now you're truly free.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.181
Oh, my God...

37:53.445 --> 37:56.970
I'm sorry, Claire.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.705
I hope we're right.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.141
Claire takes her
victims to locations

38:38.185 --> 38:39.795
that match their
trauma, best we got.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.755
Yeah, and since Tammy's friend
was found in a motel in Maui.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.496
Let's fan out.
Top floor, lower right.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.845
I got the car.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.401
Gregorio, no! No, no, no.
Let her go. Let her go.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.621
Let her go, let her go, let go.I'm gonna kill you!

39:22.664 --> 39:24.753
It's over.
You're okay.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.842
You're okay.
You're okay.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.278
You're okay.

39:28.322 --> 39:29.367
You're okay.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.933
You're... you're okay.

39:30.977 --> 39:33.414
You're okay. We got you.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.982
We got you. We got you.Okay, okay.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.641
Hand her over to the
marshals, it's federal.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.382
Copy that.

39:51.301 --> 39:55.871
Gonna take Gregorio some time
to get over this.

39:55.915 --> 40:00.398
We'll give her as much time
as she needs.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.748
Think she'll
be all right?

40:02.791 --> 40:06.273
PRIDE: I think... she helped
bring down a serial killer.

40:06.316 --> 40:09.232
Might not make up for
what she didn't do,

40:09.276 --> 40:12.497
as far as she's concerned,
but it's close.

40:32.647 --> 40:35.998
All right. I got it.
Come on in here.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.914
Easy, easy.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.699
You don't have to baby me,
Sebastian.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.309
Oh, really?

40:42.352 --> 40:44.180
'Cause, honestly,
I feel like you're lucky

40:44.224 --> 40:47.140
to be walking right now,
let alone breathing...

40:47.183 --> 40:49.316
Stop being
so dramatic.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.231
Okay, you know what,
let's just...

40:51.274 --> 40:52.928
let's go over
to the couch here.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.364
There we go.
Ah...

40:54.408 --> 40:56.584
Yup, easy.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.499
Okay, let's get
the feet up.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.459
Easy, easy.
Yup, oh, yeah.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.896
And I'm gonna order some food.
What do you want?

41:03.939 --> 41:08.509
Okay. Uh...
How 'bout some oysters?

41:08.553 --> 41:11.512
Fried oysters,
let's live a little.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.383
You want fried oysters
delivered to the...

41:13.427 --> 41:14.776
Yeah, okay, sure.Yeah.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.692
No, let's do it.
That sounds awesome.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.521
Uh, I know the guy
who owns Acme Oysters.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.783
I could text him.
He'll probably deliver.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.132
Yeah? Great.
Yeah.

41:23.176 --> 41:27.180
Well... You're not going
anywhere, are you?

41:27.223 --> 41:28.964
You gonna keep me company?

41:29.008 --> 41:31.227
Hang out Yeah.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.795
You're stuck with me, Gregorio,
whether you like it or not.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.885
Ah...
I'm sorry.

41:38.713 --> 41:40.410
Okay.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.721
What?
I don't know.

41:46.765 --> 41:50.899
Just... thank you
for kicking my ass

41:50.943 --> 41:53.162
and being there for me.

41:53.206 --> 41:56.470
Oh, my God.
What?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.471
You're getting mushy

41:57.515 --> 41:58.516
right now.

41:58.559 --> 41:59.604
Maybe.
Yeah?

41:59.647 --> 42:03.608
Wow. Here. Let's watch a movie.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.523
'Kay.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.525
It's a blanket.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.746
All right, what do you think

42:11.790 --> 42:14.314
Sebastian.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.882
You're right. We should
probably watch Seven.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.927
No.
