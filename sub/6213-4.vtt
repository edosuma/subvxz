WEBVTT

00:04.936 --> 00:08.240
Well, how did my
Halloween taffy
turn out this year?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.941
Too gooey, too garlicky

00:09.941 --> 00:11.943
and way too much unicorn.

00:11.943 --> 00:13.345
You're turning into mother.

00:13.812 --> 00:17.215
Speaking of bipolar
control freaks

00:17.215 --> 00:20.252
have you two given any thought
to your Halloween plans?

00:20.252 --> 00:21.687
If not...

00:21.987 --> 00:24.690
Oh, please. They send me
this flyer every year.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.458
It's a Halloween mystery train

00:26.458 --> 00:28.560
that makes a special stop
in Boston.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.495
Hey, this actually looks
like fun, Zel.

00:30.495 --> 00:31.863
I think it would be a hoot

00:31.863 --> 00:33.632
to ride a train
and solve a murder.

00:33.632 --> 00:34.633
No, thanks.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.636
I'm looking forward
to a nice, quiet Halloween

00:37.636 --> 00:40.072
reading, watching
a little television

00:40.072 --> 00:41.440
You and your cat go.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.674
Have a nice time.

00:42.674 --> 00:47.012
Me and Hildalicious will be
the talk of the snack car.

00:47.012 --> 00:48.246
On second thought

00:48.246 --> 00:51.683
an evening of excruciating
boredom is exactly what I need.

00:51.683 --> 00:53.919
These are awful.

00:55.987 --> 00:56.922
Salem, any thoughts

00:56.922 --> 00:58.790
on what I should go as
for Halloween?

00:58.790 --> 01:01.059
Off the top
of my head, hmm...

01:01.059 --> 01:02.060
fashion victim?

01:02.060 --> 01:03.095
Huh-huh-huh.

01:03.095 --> 01:05.197
The only thing lamer
than that joke

01:05.197 --> 01:06.798
are my plans
for Halloween.

01:06.798 --> 01:08.200
The only invitation
I was able to wangle

01:08.200 --> 01:10.802
is for a dumb dance sponsored by
the school of dentistry.

01:10.802 --> 01:13.739
Yeah. Lots of good candy there.

01:13.739 --> 01:14.740
Hmm...

01:15.841 --> 01:17.476
Ugh!

01:18.477 --> 01:19.811
Why does Aunt Zelda
always go so heavy

01:19.811 --> 01:20.912
on the unicorn?

01:21.646 --> 01:23.115
Well, now,
if you don't want

01:23.115 --> 01:25.050
your Halloween to be lame

01:25.050 --> 01:28.386
take a ride
on the Mystery Train.

01:29.888 --> 01:32.190
"For fabulous food
and sophisticated fun

01:32.190 --> 01:34.192
this Mystery Train
is number one."

01:34.192 --> 01:35.560
Salem, this is perfect.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.196
Pick me up at 7:00
and I get the window seat.

01:38.196 --> 01:40.799
Sorry, but I really wanted to
spend Halloween with my friends.

01:40.799 --> 01:41.900
You understand, don't you?

01:41.900 --> 01:44.603
I had my heart set
on riding the rails.

01:44.603 --> 01:46.972
Well, there's no reason
you can't do that.

01:46.972 --> 01:48.073

02:36.221 --> 02:38.490
we're no longer stuck dancing
with dental students.

02:38.490 --> 02:39.691
Oh, I wasn't
going, anyway.

02:39.691 --> 02:41.026
No way.
Me, either.

02:41.026 --> 02:44.396
Well, I am offering you a ride
on a Halloween mystery train.

02:44.396 --> 02:46.464
Is that one
of those totally
pathetic whodunits?

02:46.464 --> 02:48.466
Where everyone
has to play a
stupid character?

02:48.466 --> 02:50.435
And solve a fake,
idiotic murder?

02:50.435 --> 02:52.370
That any moron
could figure out?

02:52.370 --> 02:53.371
Exactly.

02:53.371 --> 02:55.907
Whoo-hoo! We're going
on a mystery train!

02:56.107 --> 02:57.442
Oh, come on, Josh.

02:57.442 --> 02:59.678
Tell everybody why
this is going to be so great.

02:59.678 --> 03:02.447
Okay, right after you tell me.

03:02.447 --> 03:04.149
You mean you don't want
to go either?

03:04.149 --> 03:05.150
Not really.

03:05.150 --> 03:09.020
Sabrina, I've never been
that into Halloween.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.489
To be honest, it's always
kind of bugged me

03:11.489 --> 03:12.524
that it's such
a big deal to you.

03:12.524 --> 03:14.259
Well, it's a big deal to me

03:14.259 --> 03:16.962
because I happen
to be a wi... wittle upset

03:16.962 --> 03:19.764
because I paid
for these tickets in advance.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.866
Well I'm a "wittle" upset

03:20.866 --> 03:22.601
because I like to be
asked ahead of time

03:22.601 --> 03:24.169
before someone makes
plans for me.

03:24.169 --> 03:25.403
I just thought
this would be fun

03:25.403 --> 03:27.105
and I thought you guys
would think so, too.

03:27.105 --> 03:28.173
Especially you, Josh.

03:28.173 --> 03:29.241
Fine.

03:29.241 --> 03:31.910
I guess a little train ride
won't kill us.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.311
( <i>all groan</i> )

03:33.311 --> 03:36.548
Yeah! That's exactly the kind
of enthusiasm I'm looking for.

03:37.649 --> 03:39.985
Ooh, good thing
you paid in advance.

03:39.985 --> 03:41.720
We'll be lucky
to find a seat.

03:41.953 --> 03:43.822
Well, I think
we should feel lucky

03:43.822 --> 03:45.590
that we got
our own private car.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.293
With a different stain
on every seat.

03:48.727 --> 03:49.895
It's so cold in here

03:49.895 --> 03:51.730
my beard is sprouting icicles.

03:51.730 --> 03:54.933
That's why I told everyone
to wear coats and gloves.

03:54.933 --> 03:57.102
But the pressure
will do us good.

03:57.102 --> 04:00.405
Comingled with the 47 known
carcinogens in diesel smoke?

04:00.405 --> 04:03.208
Okay, there is
now an official
moratorium on whining.

04:03.208 --> 04:07.212
Welcome aboard the
Halloween Mystery Train

04:07.212 --> 04:10.615
where murder is our business,
and our business is murder.

04:10.615 --> 04:11.983
They make me say that.

04:11.983 --> 04:14.419
So, let's get the
festivities rolling

04:14.419 --> 04:15.987
with your complimentary

04:15.987 --> 04:18.156
cocktail and appetizer.

04:18.924 --> 04:20.825
Peanuts and a juice box?

04:20.825 --> 04:21.860
Oh, great.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.029
And I didn't even get
the freaking juice box.

04:24.029 --> 04:25.063
You want a juice box?

04:25.063 --> 04:26.331
I'll give you a juice box.

04:26.331 --> 04:28.533
Here, take mine.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.169
Oh, ugh, sorry.

04:31.169 --> 04:33.305
A little taffy emergency.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.873
I've got to go de-goo.

04:35.073 --> 04:38.810
So, listen up, mystery lovers.

04:38.977 --> 04:42.480
Here are the parts that
you will be playing.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.749
Please, read them.

04:44.749 --> 04:49.688
And as we say at the Stella
Adler Academy, "Become them."

04:49.688 --> 04:52.958
If I'm lucky, I get thrown
from the train in the first act.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.059
Trade you.

04:54.059 --> 04:55.193
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard!

04:55.193 --> 04:57.963
The Other Realm Express
is now leaving the station.

04:57.963 --> 04:59.998
( <i>whistle blowing</i> )
Other Realm Express?

04:59.998 --> 05:02.867
Oh, no! I got to get everybody
off this thing before...

05:02.867 --> 05:05.370
( <i>'20s music playing</i> )

05:05.370 --> 05:07.839
...something like this happens.

05:09.074 --> 05:10.842
It's been years
since I've watched

05:10.842 --> 05:13.812
the Giant Pumpkin drop
in the Other Realm Times Square.

05:13.812 --> 05:15.146
I can't wait.

05:15.146 --> 05:17.816
Winos and tourists
splattered with
pumpkin guts.

05:17.816 --> 05:19.951
Have I mentioned
how bored I am?

05:19.951 --> 05:21.953
You wouldn't be bored
if you'd taken

05:21.953 --> 05:24.322
that Murder Mystery Train
like I told you.

05:24.322 --> 05:26.725
Maybe I'll morph myself
into a college student

05:26.725 --> 05:28.593
and join Sabrina
at that dental party.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.729
I could use a dentist
after all that taffy.

05:30.729 --> 05:32.931
The joke's on you.

05:32.931 --> 05:34.532
Sabrina had the perspicacity

05:34.532 --> 05:36.868
to heed my advice
and take her friends

05:36.868 --> 05:40.472
on the aforementioned
Traino Mysterioso.

05:40.472 --> 05:42.207
Friends?

05:42.207 --> 05:44.909
Salem, that's
an Other Realm train.

05:44.909 --> 05:45.710
Oops.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.512
Looks like there's
going to be a murder

05:47.512 --> 05:49.647
around here, but this
one won't be a mystery.

05:49.647 --> 05:52.150
( <i>whistle blowing</i> )

05:53.518 --> 05:54.586
There's been
a big mistake!

05:54.586 --> 05:55.620
There are mortals
on board!

05:55.620 --> 05:57.288
You've got to stop
this train right away!

05:57.288 --> 05:59.958
Sorry, miss, there's only
one way to stop this train.

05:59.958 --> 06:00.792
What's that?

06:00.792 --> 06:02.861
You, dear girl,
have to solve the mystery.

06:02.861 --> 06:05.463
Me?
You are the detective
in this play.

06:05.463 --> 06:07.599
Since you've already
paid for the costume

06:07.599 --> 06:08.833
you might as well
look the part.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.470
Ooh, London Fog.

06:13.238 --> 06:16.341
Allow me to introduce you
to your cast of characters.

06:16.341 --> 06:18.710
May I present
the Countess Admira.

06:18.710 --> 06:19.911
Delighted.

06:19.911 --> 06:23.782
I find modern travel
so exhilarating, don't you?

06:23.782 --> 06:25.216
Her maid, Hortense.

06:25.216 --> 06:27.352
Charmed, I'm sure.

06:27.352 --> 06:29.988
Professor Augustine
Von Claptrap.

06:29.988 --> 06:31.589
<i>Bitte, Fraulein.</i>

06:31.589 --> 06:32.557
And, of course...

06:32.557 --> 06:35.827
Biff Buffington,
international tennis star.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.529
A real pleasure.

06:37.529 --> 06:40.432
At least I know it is for you.

06:40.432 --> 06:41.433
Where's Josh?

06:41.433 --> 06:45.470
Oh, you mean world-renowned
photographer Kip Kodak.

06:45.470 --> 06:48.940
Yes, well, unfortunately,
he's been the victim of a...

06:48.940 --> 06:51.109
murder.

06:51.109 --> 06:52.777
Oh!

06:52.777 --> 06:54.012
( <i>laughing</i> )

06:54.012 --> 06:55.647
Murder?

06:55.647 --> 06:56.614
Murder?!

06:56.614 --> 06:57.582
Murder!

06:57.582 --> 06:58.583
Great.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.251
Something else for me
to clean up.

07:00.251 --> 07:03.321
Oh, no, he really is dead!

07:03.321 --> 07:06.157
And the game begins.

07:06.157 --> 07:07.892
All you have to do
is figure out

07:07.892 --> 07:10.762
which one of our passengers
killed Kip Kodak.

07:13.731 --> 07:15.700
I'm not very good
at solving murders.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.036
I-I even stink at "Clue."

07:18.036 --> 07:19.871
The first question you want
to ask yourself is

07:19.871 --> 07:20.905
What was the motive?

07:20.905 --> 07:23.641
I just wanted to give my friends
a nice Halloween.

07:24.375 --> 07:27.479
Oh, you mean,
the murderer's motive.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.551
Would you please stop worrying?

07:33.551 --> 07:35.653
Sabrina is
a smart girl.

07:35.653 --> 07:37.722
I'm sure she'll have this
mystery solved in no time.

07:37.722 --> 07:39.124
What are you talking about?

07:39.124 --> 07:40.492
Even I beat her at "Clue."

07:40.492 --> 07:42.327
Well, why don't we
grab a crystal ball

07:42.327 --> 07:43.495
and go check up on her?

07:43.495 --> 07:44.496
Good idea.

07:44.496 --> 07:48.399
I've got one in
my hope chest.

07:48.399 --> 07:51.669
What? I use it
for traffic reports.

07:52.003 --> 07:53.338
( <i>whistle blowing</i> )

07:55.740 --> 07:59.110
Now, Countess,
tell me what you know
about the murder.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.778
Murder, murder, murder.

08:00.778 --> 08:03.381
Everyone is so preoccupied
with murder.

08:03.381 --> 08:06.818
What you should be focused on
is what happened to my ring.

08:06.818 --> 08:09.487
The hundred-carat
Star of Paramus is missing.

08:09.487 --> 08:13.224
Missing hunk of pure carbon,
untimely death of my boyfriend!

08:13.224 --> 08:14.325
Whatever.

08:14.325 --> 08:17.328
Now, tell me your relationship
to the deceased.

08:17.328 --> 08:18.329
I had none.

08:18.329 --> 08:19.864
I'd never met the man
in my life.

08:19.864 --> 08:21.065
"Never met the man..."

08:21.065 --> 08:22.867
All right, you dragged it
out of me!

08:22.867 --> 08:24.068
We were in love!

08:24.068 --> 08:26.638
I was mad about the boy
desperately

08:26.638 --> 08:27.705
passionately

08:27.705 --> 08:30.408
but he ended it horribly,
cruelly

08:30.408 --> 08:36.314
and I vowed that some way,
somehow, I would get my revenge!

08:39.050 --> 08:41.519
But then I got over it
and we became friends.

08:41.519 --> 08:42.954
So, you see,
I really have

08:42.954 --> 08:45.390
no motive for killing him.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.158
Nope. None whatsoever.

08:47.158 --> 08:49.327
So, you actually work
for the Countess?

08:49.327 --> 08:50.795
I know where you're
going with this.

08:50.795 --> 08:52.630
Do I?
You think I'm
the murderer, don't you?

08:52.630 --> 08:55.066
You think I killed him so that
I could frame the Countess.

08:55.066 --> 08:57.602
That way, I would be free of
that cruel, self-centered pain

08:57.602 --> 08:58.670
in my patoot forever.

08:58.670 --> 09:01.172
So, you killed Kip Kodak
to frame the Countess.

09:01.172 --> 09:02.240
Do you think I'd tell you
if I did?

09:02.240 --> 09:05.243
Yeah. But then I'm
kind of new at this.

09:05.243 --> 09:06.578
Oh, <i>ja,</i> I knew him.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.713
We veren't, as you say, "buds"

09:08.713 --> 09:11.216
but he was a nice enough
kind of guy

09:11.216 --> 09:12.684
if you like zat kind of guy.

09:12.684 --> 09:15.086
And what kind of guy is dat?

09:15.086 --> 09:16.254
I mean, that.

09:16.254 --> 09:19.390
Oh, you know, ze kind
who always gets ze girl.

09:19.390 --> 09:22.427
Ze kind women prefer
over quirky and unique.

09:22.427 --> 09:26.431
Ze kind that makes a guy like me
blend into the wallpaper!

09:26.431 --> 09:30.401
Schnitzel! I seem to have
snapped my pipe.

09:31.236 --> 09:32.503
Anyway, as I was saying

09:32.503 --> 09:34.372
I really had no motive
whatsoever.

09:34.372 --> 09:37.041
You're probably quite
intimidated talking

09:37.041 --> 09:39.944
to an international tennis star
like myself.

09:39.944 --> 09:43.281
Yeah, very. So, um, tell me
what you know about the murder.

09:43.281 --> 09:45.984
Let's stop this charade.

09:45.984 --> 09:47.485
You want me.

09:47.485 --> 09:50.555
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm okay with that.

09:50.555 --> 09:51.889
Well, I have
a problem with guys

09:51.889 --> 09:53.057
who use the word "charade."

09:53.057 --> 09:54.692
Especially ones that
use it that use it

09:54.692 --> 09:56.828
while my boyfriend's lying
dead in the other room.

09:56.828 --> 09:58.997
All right,
I'll come clean.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.633
I used to be in love
with a woman--

10:01.633 --> 10:05.703
a wonderful, magical woman--

10:05.770 --> 10:07.705
...and that scoundrel
stole her from me!

10:07.705 --> 10:08.840
And that made you angry?

10:08.840 --> 10:09.874
Furious!

10:09.874 --> 10:12.577
Why would she pick
that second-rate shutterbug

10:12.577 --> 10:16.981
over Biff Buffington,
international tennis star?

10:16.981 --> 10:19.484
As you can see,
I put it behind me.

10:19.484 --> 10:22.086
Let me guess.
You have no motive whatsoever.

10:22.086 --> 10:24.989
It's nice to have you
in my court.

10:24.989 --> 10:28.059
Well, what have you
come up with so far?

10:28.059 --> 10:30.928
First, your play involves
a lot of ham acting.

10:30.928 --> 10:33.298
Second, I have no idea
who killed Kip.

10:33.298 --> 10:35.400
Might I suggest you find out?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.136
Just for conversation's sake,
what happens if I don't?

10:38.136 --> 10:41.306
Unless you solve this case,
you and your mortal friends

10:41.306 --> 10:44.575
will be trapped
on this train <i>forever.</i>

10:44.809 --> 10:46.444
No!

10:51.416 --> 10:52.884
No!

10:52.984 --> 10:56.421
Hilda, I think we've got
ourselves a train to catch.

10:56.421 --> 10:58.890
All aboard!

10:58.890 --> 11:00.491
This is insane.

11:00.491 --> 11:03.227
We can't just go soaring
through the cosmos forever.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.762
I'm sorry--
rules are rules.

11:04.762 --> 11:07.131
Besides, everything you need
to solve this case

11:07.131 --> 11:08.399
is right in front of you.

11:08.399 --> 11:10.468
Right in front of me, where?

11:12.036 --> 11:13.371
( <i>gasps</i> )

11:13.604 --> 11:15.006
Look!

11:15.006 --> 11:16.908
He still has the juice box
I gave him

11:16.908 --> 11:18.443
and it's unopened,
which means

11:18.443 --> 11:20.378
he was killed
right after I left him.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.113
( <i>gasps</i> )

11:22.113 --> 11:25.650
The Countess's missing diamond!

11:25.650 --> 11:27.585
Splendid. He found it.

11:27.585 --> 11:30.955
If he weren't dead,
I'd buy him something.

11:31.756 --> 11:33.358
No matter.

11:33.358 --> 11:36.294
I still have
the Secaucus Sapphire.

11:36.294 --> 11:39.864
An old sweaty tennis towel
with the initials B.B.

11:39.864 --> 11:41.599
Do they stand for
Betty Boop

11:41.599 --> 11:43.368
Bugs Bunny or...

11:43.368 --> 11:45.169
Biff Buffington?

11:46.771 --> 11:48.239
I knew it had to be you!

11:48.239 --> 11:50.007
You're just the sort of guy.

11:50.007 --> 11:51.476
Sort of guy?

11:51.476 --> 11:52.643
Sort of guy?!

11:52.643 --> 11:54.545
What exactly is that
supposed to mean?

11:54.545 --> 11:56.347
If anybody's guilty here,
it's her.

11:56.347 --> 11:57.048
I knew it!

11:57.048 --> 11:58.316
( <i>clamoring</i> )

11:58.316 --> 12:00.685
Finally, I'm having
a positive impact.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.320
They're turning on each other.

12:05.189 --> 12:07.425
Please tell me we're in
the right place this time.

12:07.425 --> 12:09.093
Is it my fault
the space shuttle

12:09.093 --> 12:11.062
looks exactly like
the mystery train?

12:11.062 --> 12:14.198
Do you think I should have given
that cosmonaut my number?

12:14.198 --> 12:15.633
So cute.

12:15.633 --> 12:16.901
According to this schedule

12:16.901 --> 12:19.270
the train should have left
Boston two hours ago.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.571
Should be here any minute.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.106
( <i>train approaching</i> )

12:22.106 --> 12:23.574
There it is now.

12:23.574 --> 12:25.109
But it's not stopping!

12:25.109 --> 12:26.377
What should we do?

12:26.377 --> 12:27.845
Jump!

12:32.350 --> 12:34.085
That was close.

12:34.085 --> 12:36.287
Hey, my outfit's
getting all dirty.

12:36.287 --> 12:39.757
Yeah, well,
my caboose is on fire!

12:40.391 --> 12:41.759
( <i>arguing</i> )

12:41.759 --> 12:43.060
People, people!

12:43.060 --> 12:45.763
Please, work
with me here, okay?

12:45.763 --> 12:47.098
The sooner we figure this out

12:47.098 --> 12:48.699
the sooner we can get off
this train.

12:48.699 --> 12:49.967
So, in the interest of time

12:49.967 --> 12:53.271
what say the murderer
just raises his or her hand?

12:53.271 --> 12:54.972
Don't be shy.

12:54.972 --> 12:56.107
Anybody.

12:56.107 --> 12:57.308
Anybody at all.

12:57.308 --> 12:58.676
Biff?

12:58.676 --> 13:00.778
You can't honestly expect me

13:00.778 --> 13:04.315
to admit to a crime
I didn't commit.

13:04.315 --> 13:05.917
I am a man of honor, integrity

13:05.917 --> 13:08.619
and amazing bone structure.

13:08.619 --> 13:11.022
Whose towel was wrapped
around the victim's neck?

13:11.022 --> 13:12.890
I had absolutely
no motive whatsoever.

13:12.890 --> 13:13.791
Nor did I.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.960
Well, I didn't
have any...

13:15.960 --> 13:18.262
And I am officially
the world's worst detective.

13:18.262 --> 13:19.497
( <i>thud</i> )

13:19.497 --> 13:20.598
A murder.

13:20.598 --> 13:21.699
Murder?

13:21.699 --> 13:22.700
Murder?!

13:22.700 --> 13:24.235
Murder!

13:24.235 --> 13:26.437
Great. Something else
for me to clean up.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.839
There's been another murder?

13:27.839 --> 13:29.574
Uh-uh-uh. Same murder.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.708
And until you solve it

13:30.708 --> 13:32.276
we're all destined to keep

13:32.276 --> 13:34.545
replaying the same scene
over and over

13:34.545 --> 13:35.613
and the longer you take

13:35.613 --> 13:38.483
the longer I have
to wear these slacks.

13:38.483 --> 13:40.151
Aah!

13:41.486 --> 13:44.555
Well, well, well. Huh.

13:44.555 --> 13:46.958
You never know
what kind of riffraff

13:46.958 --> 13:49.460
you're going to come across
riding the rails.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.862
Back off, Grandpa!

13:50.862 --> 13:52.563
Salem, don't be rude.

13:52.563 --> 13:53.898
Who's being rude?

13:53.898 --> 13:56.801
He really is my Grandpa.

13:56.968 --> 13:58.536
Thanks for the birthday card.

13:58.536 --> 13:59.637
No problem.

13:59.637 --> 14:01.239
How's your mom?

14:01.239 --> 14:03.107
I hate to break up
this family reunion

14:03.107 --> 14:05.142
but we're looking
for the mystery train.

14:05.142 --> 14:06.677
You're on it.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.246
But you want the parlor car.

14:08.246 --> 14:11.549
Grandma tells people
he was lost at sea.

14:14.519 --> 14:18.089
Now I understand why people
don't take the train anymore.

14:18.089 --> 14:20.525
Tunnel!
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

14:20.525 --> 14:23.094
So, let's go through
what we know so far.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.196
I left the cabin
and Kip was alive.

14:25.196 --> 14:26.998
I came back,
and Kip was dead.

14:26.998 --> 14:28.699
That's about it.

14:29.901 --> 14:31.903
Oh, Sabrina, there you are.

14:31.903 --> 14:33.170
Oh, Aunt Hilda,
Aunt Zelda

14:33.170 --> 14:34.472
thank goodness
you're here!

14:34.472 --> 14:36.641
I didn't know this was
an Other Realm train

14:36.641 --> 14:38.476
and now Josh is dead
and I have to...

14:38.476 --> 14:41.345
Did somebody shoot you guys
out of a cannon?

14:42.680 --> 14:43.814
( <i>chiming</i> )

14:44.015 --> 14:45.917
Sabrina, there's
no need to fear.

14:45.917 --> 14:47.251
Your aunties are here.

14:47.251 --> 14:50.288
Will there be two more
for dinner?

14:50.288 --> 14:53.190
Oh, no. We're just
passing through.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.159
Oh, too bad.

14:56.994 --> 14:58.462
Yowzer.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.765
I wouldn't mind spending
eternity on this train.

15:00.765 --> 15:02.767
Hello? Did you see
the way he looked at me?

15:02.767 --> 15:04.735
Okay, I have a plan.

15:05.136 --> 15:07.305
First, I'm going to
interrogate the steward.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.439
Hey, that was <i>my</i> plan.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.141
And this plan helps me, how?

15:10.141 --> 15:11.542
He knows who
the murderer is.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.345
Trust me, we'll have it
out of him in ten minutes, tops.

15:14.345 --> 15:16.981
Five, if he's ticklish.

15:17.114 --> 15:18.115
And if that doesn't work

15:18.115 --> 15:20.551
you always have <i>me</i>
to solve the crime.

15:20.551 --> 15:24.522
At least, you would,
if I had the appropriate attire.

15:26.524 --> 15:29.827
Mm, say, good show, old girl.

15:30.227 --> 15:32.029
Now, then, what say we have

15:32.029 --> 15:34.231
a look at the corpse, shall we?

15:34.231 --> 15:36.667
This body is simply
rife with clues.

15:36.667 --> 15:40.905
What, pray tell, have you been
doing for the last few hours?

15:40.905 --> 15:43.841
Hey, I found the diamond
and the tennis towel.

15:43.841 --> 15:47.178
Hmm, those items, combined
with this feather I found

15:47.178 --> 15:50.781
should tell us everything
we need to know.

15:51.082 --> 15:52.917
I can't believe I missed this.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.752
In your defense, it was lodged

15:54.752 --> 15:56.887
fairly deep into
his nasal passage.

15:56.887 --> 15:57.955
Ugh!

15:58.356 --> 15:59.590
I believe we only have

15:59.590 --> 16:01.759
one thing left to do:
dust the body.

16:01.759 --> 16:02.693
For fingerprints?

16:02.693 --> 16:05.162
No. It's filthy.

16:05.162 --> 16:07.531
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

16:07.531 --> 16:10.167
When is it my turn
to interrogate him?

16:10.167 --> 16:12.136
Hilda, I told you,
we're giving him the old

16:12.136 --> 16:13.638
"good witch/bad witch" routine.

16:13.638 --> 16:14.805
Oh, right.

16:14.805 --> 16:16.007
Which one am I again?

16:16.007 --> 16:18.776
This one was a bit dodgy,
all right

16:18.776 --> 16:21.245
but I think
we came up cricket.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.047
Do you even know
what that means?

16:23.047 --> 16:24.715
Haven't the foggiest.

16:24.715 --> 16:29.587
<i>But</i> I do know which one of you
is the murderer!

16:31.288 --> 16:33.157
It all began to make sense

16:33.157 --> 16:37.395
when I learned of
the Countess's missing diamond.

16:38.663 --> 16:40.731
<i>Sabrina was out of the room</i>

16:40.731 --> 16:44.335
<i>so the Countess knew she only</i>
<i>had seconds to make her move.</i>

16:44.335 --> 16:46.637
<i>Counting on</i>
<i>their prior relationship</i>

16:46.637 --> 16:49.907
<i>and Kip's impeccable manners,</i>
<i>she offered her hand.</i>

16:49.907 --> 16:53.110
<i>She also knew that the prong</i>
<i>on her ring was loose</i>

16:53.110 --> 16:56.847
<i>and her plan worked perfectly.</i>

16:57.815 --> 17:00.017
<i>Kip started to choke</i>
<i>on the stone.</i>

17:00.017 --> 17:01.152
I knew it!

17:01.152 --> 17:02.687
Countess Admira is the murderer.

17:02.687 --> 17:03.888
No, I'm not!

17:03.888 --> 17:05.289
But she would have been

17:05.289 --> 17:07.792
if Hortense hadn't stepped in.

17:08.459 --> 17:10.161
<i>A former RAF nurse</i>

17:10.161 --> 17:12.396
<i>her instincts</i>
<i>got the better of her</i>

17:12.396 --> 17:14.331
<i>but she had a plan of her own.</i>

17:14.331 --> 17:17.668
<i>She knew that Kip was</i>
<i>highly allergic to emu</i>
<i>feathers</i>

17:17.668 --> 17:21.505
<i>and that prolonged exposure</i>
<i>could kill him.</i>

17:21.505 --> 17:22.707
I knew it!

17:22.707 --> 17:24.108
Hortense is the murderer.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.409
No, I'm not.

17:25.409 --> 17:27.144
But she might have been

17:27.144 --> 17:31.549
if it weren't for an involuntary
muscle contraction.

17:31.549 --> 17:34.185
<i>Kip sneezed--</i>
<i>violently, I would imagine--</i>

17:34.185 --> 17:38.122
<i>and dislodged all but one of</i>
<i>the feathers from his nostrils.</i>

17:38.122 --> 17:41.525
<i>However, Biff Buffington</i>
<i>seized upon the opportunity</i>

17:41.525 --> 17:44.528
<i>like only an international</i>
<i>tennis star could.</i>

17:44.528 --> 17:47.131
<i>He offered Kip</i>
<i>one of his towels--</i>

17:47.131 --> 17:49.967
<i>to wipe his nose,</i>
<i>or to strangle him?</i>

17:49.967 --> 17:51.469
How <i>could</i> you?!

17:51.469 --> 17:52.937
I didn't.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.205
He's right,
you know.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.439
He didn't.

17:55.439 --> 17:56.640
Cut to the chase, Sherlock.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.975
We're running out of suspects.

17:57.975 --> 18:01.445
Which brings me to my most
interesting piece of evidence:

18:01.445 --> 18:03.314
the dust on the body.

18:03.314 --> 18:08.152
It wasn't dust at all...
but pipe smoke.

18:09.086 --> 18:10.554
That means nothing.

18:10.554 --> 18:11.789
You also smoke a pipe.

18:11.789 --> 18:15.659
Yes, but mine
only blows bubbles.

18:18.262 --> 18:19.764
<i>Once Kip had recovered</i>

18:19.764 --> 18:22.600
<i>the Professor came up behind</i>
<i>him and offered Kip his pipe</i>

18:22.600 --> 18:24.502
<i>containing tobacco,</i>
<i>a substance which</i>

18:24.502 --> 18:27.004
<i>according to the entire</i>
<i>Western medical community</i>

18:27.004 --> 18:28.339
<i>kills eventually.</i>

18:28.339 --> 18:30.341
But Kip doesn't smoke.

18:30.341 --> 18:31.742
Exactly.

18:31.742 --> 18:32.877
Which is why
the Professor

18:32.877 --> 18:36.313
is definitely
not the murderer.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.216
So, none of them
is the murderer?

18:39.216 --> 18:41.118
I thought you said
you solved the crime.

18:41.118 --> 18:42.286
I have.

18:42.286 --> 18:44.421
The murder was committed
by someone

18:44.421 --> 18:47.158
who had both motive and means.

18:47.158 --> 18:51.929
Someone who had a working
knowledge of poison.

18:51.929 --> 18:54.965
<i>Someone who knew that</i>
<i>in large quantities</i>

18:54.965 --> 18:57.868
<i>essence of unicorn</i>
<i>is fatal to mortals.</i>

18:57.868 --> 18:59.303
Ugh. Ugh.

18:59.303 --> 19:02.673
Why does Aunt Zelda always go
so heavy on the unicorn?

19:02.907 --> 19:07.244
SALEM:
<i>Someone who seized</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

19:07.244 --> 19:08.946
<i>and went to great lengths</i>

19:08.946 --> 19:11.382
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>she covered her tracks.</i>

19:11.382 --> 19:14.685
That's why I told everyone
to wear coats and gloves.

19:14.685 --> 19:17.388
Someone who knew that the poison
need not be ingested

19:17.388 --> 19:20.124
<i>but can easily be absorbed</i>
<i>through the skin</i>

19:20.124 --> 19:24.728
<i>and placed it on something</i>
<i>as innocuous as a juice box.</i>

19:24.728 --> 19:26.263
You're talking crazy, cat.

19:26.263 --> 19:27.198
The murderer!

19:27.198 --> 19:28.199
Murderer!

19:28.199 --> 19:29.099
Murderer!

19:29.099 --> 19:31.001
The dame who bumped him off.

19:31.001 --> 19:32.536
Why are you all accusing me?

19:32.536 --> 19:33.871
I didn't do it, I swear!

19:33.871 --> 19:35.573
I-I didn't even have a motive.

19:35.573 --> 19:37.641
Oh, no?

19:37.641 --> 19:39.476
Isn't it true that
you're angry with Josh

19:39.476 --> 19:40.711
for not supporting you

19:40.711 --> 19:43.147
in your ever more manic quest
for the perfect Halloween?

19:43.147 --> 19:44.281
Could you have been

19:44.281 --> 19:47.017
so resentful of his pouty
attitude and sarcasm

19:47.017 --> 19:49.386
that the rage built up
in you and you...

19:49.386 --> 19:51.355
Yes, it's true!

19:51.355 --> 19:52.556
It's true!

19:52.556 --> 19:54.091
I'm the murderer!

19:54.091 --> 19:55.726
I killed Josh!

19:55.926 --> 19:58.495
Wow, I totally didn't see
that one coming.

20:00.497 --> 20:02.600
( <i>gasping and choking</i> )

20:02.600 --> 20:04.468
Sabrina's the murderer.

20:04.468 --> 20:06.770
Good work, sister.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.172
Let's go.

20:08.339 --> 20:10.307
Oh, here's your gum.

20:10.441 --> 20:12.943
Sabrina, we know
who the murderer is!

20:12.943 --> 20:14.245
It's you.

20:14.245 --> 20:16.146
So I've heard.

20:16.146 --> 20:17.982
So what happens to me now?

20:17.982 --> 20:19.483
Well... Ahem.

20:19.483 --> 20:21.452
Now that you've solved
the murder

20:21.452 --> 20:22.519
you're free to go.

20:22.519 --> 20:23.554
Really?

20:23.554 --> 20:24.555
Mm-hmm.
Wow, this is great.

20:24.555 --> 20:26.690
You know, you sure
throw a nice homicide.

20:26.690 --> 20:29.059
But how did you know
about Aunt Zelda's taffy

20:29.059 --> 20:30.561
and that I was mad at Josh?

20:30.561 --> 20:33.731
Murder's our business,
and our business is murder.

20:33.731 --> 20:36.600
Next stop, Boston!

20:36.600 --> 20:38.569
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

20:38.569 --> 20:39.937
Wow.

20:40.104 --> 20:43.107
He really does murder right.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.812
Whoa, I don't remember much

20:48.812 --> 20:50.180
but this Halloween
was exhausting.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.715
I'm so dead.

20:51.715 --> 20:53.517
No, you're not--
you're alive again.

20:53.517 --> 20:54.418
Again?

20:54.418 --> 20:55.986
Look, Josh,
I want to talk to you

20:55.986 --> 20:57.588
about this whole
Halloween thing.

20:57.588 --> 20:59.623
It may not be an important
holiday for you

20:59.623 --> 21:00.824
but it is for me

21:00.824 --> 21:03.027
and I was hurt that
you weren't more supportive.

21:03.027 --> 21:04.528
I mean, I supported you when...

21:04.528 --> 21:05.996
When I was going
to move to Prague

21:05.996 --> 21:07.231
when I got a job
on the paper

21:07.231 --> 21:08.999
and with pretty much
everything I've done

21:08.999 --> 21:10.167
since you've known me.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.236
I'm sorry, Sabrina.

21:14.371 --> 21:16.907
Sabrina... I seem
to have misplaced

21:16.907 --> 21:18.642
a few hours of my life.

21:18.642 --> 21:21.745
Was this a bewitching
kind of evening?

21:21.745 --> 21:25.082
It was for me,
and I know it was for you

21:25.082 --> 21:27.751
or should I say
"Biff Buffington"?

21:27.751 --> 21:30.020
Say me.
