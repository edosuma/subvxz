WEBVTT

00:10.280 --> 00:11.220
Benson: GUYS.

00:11.320 --> 00:11.860
GUYS!

00:11.960 --> 00:13.420
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.180
I KNOW THAT I'M THE ONE BEING

00:15.280 --> 00:16.980
HONORED TOMORROW WITH A GOLD

00:17.080 --> 00:18.700
WATCH FOR SHOWING UP TO WORK

00:18.800 --> 00:20.620
1,000 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN A ROW,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.380
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IT'S

00:22.480 --> 00:24.580
ACTUALLY ABOUT YOU GUYS.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.300
SO THANK YOU.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.380
Skips: THANKS, BENSON.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.320
THAT MEANS A LOT.
Thomas: HOW DO YOU DO IT?

00:28.520 --> 00:31.720
HOW DO YOU ALWAYS GET TO WORK ON
TIME?

00:30.200 --> 00:33.240
Benson: THAT IS A GREAT
QUESTION, THOMAS.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.980
DID EVERYBODY HEAR THAT?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.460
THE GUY KNOWS HOW TO THINK.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.260
I'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR IN LIFE BY

00:37.360 --> 00:38.820
DOING ONE THING, AND THAT'S

00:38.920 --> 00:39.940
PLAYING IT SAFE.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.900
I SET THREE ALARM CLOCKS EVERY

00:42.000 --> 00:43.660
NIGHT, INCLUDING THIS ONE.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.060
AND THEN I LEAVE MY TOAST AND

00:45.160 --> 00:46.660
COFFEE OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE SO

00:46.760 --> 00:48.260
THAT IT'S READY FOR ME WHEN I

00:48.360 --> 00:50.800
WAKE UP.
Muscle Man: YOU EAT STALE

00:50.360 --> 00:52.720
TOAST?
Benson: YES.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.820
AND I DON'T LIKE IT, NOT ONE

00:52.920 --> 00:53.300
BIT.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.740
BUT I KNOW THAT IT'LL ALL BE

00:54.840 --> 00:56.180
WORTH IT THE MOMENT THAT

00:56.280 --> 00:57.980
MR. MAELLARD HONORS ME WITH THAT

00:58.080 --> 01:00.640
GOLD WATCH.
Hi Five: YOU MUST WANT THAT

00:59.920 --> 01:02.600
WATCH PRETTY BAD, HUH?
Benson: OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA

01:02.480 --> 01:04.300
HOW LONG I'VE WANTED THAT THING.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.180
BUT TONIGHT I CAN FINALLY STAND

01:06.280 --> 01:08.100
BEFORE YOU GUYS AND SAY, "I DID

01:08.200 --> 01:08.660
IT!"

01:08.760 --> 01:10.020
( ALL CHEER )

01:10.120 --> 01:11.340
Muscle Man: HEY, MAN, I DON'T

01:11.440 --> 01:14.480
MEAN TO BE A DEBBIE H. DOWNER
HERE, BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A

01:13.800 --> 01:16.880
LITTLE BIT EARLY TO BE
CELEBRATING?

01:15.560 --> 01:18.800
I MEAN, YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE
IT ON TIME TOMORROW.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.940
Benson: OH, COME ON,

01:19.040 --> 01:21.560
MUSCLE MAN.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG

01:20.960 --> 01:22.220
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN?

01:22.320 --> 01:23.300
Mordecai: HEY, BENSON.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.780
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS ââ

01:24.880 --> 01:28.160
THESE GUYS ARE CELEBRATING 1,000

01:27.000 --> 01:28.020
1,000 TEST MISSIONS.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.500
Benson: YOU GUYS ARE TEST

01:29.600 --> 01:32.000
PILOTS?
WE SURE ARE.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.140
HEY.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.620
I'M TANGO, AND THIS IS STACHE.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.900
Benson: WAIT, YOU'RE NOT

01:34.000 --> 01:34.500
STACHE?

01:34.600 --> 01:35.380
NO, I'M TANGO.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.080
HE'S STACHE.
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US FOR

01:37.520 --> 01:40.920
SOME WINGS, AND WE'LL CELEBRATE
OUR 1,000s TOGETHER.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.980
Benson: MORE WINGS?

01:42.080 --> 01:44.860
BENSON LIKEY, AND I'M BENSON.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.180
Skips: I'M NOT SURE MORE

01:46.280 --> 01:47.780
WINGS IS A GOOD IDEA, BENSON.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.220
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT YOURSELF

01:49.320 --> 01:50.620
INTO A FOOD COMA AGAIN.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.260
Pops: YES.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.780
PERHAPS YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH

01:52.880 --> 01:53.980
WINGING FOR ONE NIGHT.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.580
Benson: LOOK, I CAN HANDLE

01:55.680 --> 01:58.160

IT'S JUST ONE ROUND.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.460
Skips: IT'S JUST, UH...

01:58.560 --> 02:01.840
WELL, SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO THINGS
THEY REGRET ON A BELLYFUL OF

02:00.960 --> 02:01.380
WINGS.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.420
Pops: THAT'S ALL WE'RE

02:02.520 --> 02:04.880
SAYING.
Benson: DON'T WORRY, GUYS.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.020
I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.220
( ALARM BEEPS )

02:10.320 --> 02:14.940
OW, MY HEAD.

02:15.040 --> 02:15.940
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

02:16.040 --> 02:17.460
( Thinking ) WHAT COULD POSSIBLY

02:17.560 --> 02:20.840
GO WRONG BETWEEN NOW AND THEN?
Mordecai: HEY, BENSON, YOU'RE

NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.840

02:23.720 --> 02:24.780

02:24.880 --> 02:27.780
MORDECAI AND RIGBY!

02:27.880 --> 02:30.620
( BREATHING HEAVILY )

02:30.720 --> 02:32.300
WHERE AM I?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.300
AH, I ONLY HAVE THREE HOURS TO

02:34.400 --> 02:35.180
GET BACK.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.340
HOW AM I EVER ââ

02:36.440 --> 02:37.980
WAIT, A ROAD.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.940
I'M SAVED.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.100
( DIALING )

02:42.200 --> 02:43.060
COME ON, COME ON.

02:43.160 --> 02:43.700
PICK UP!

02:43.800 --> 02:44.580
Pops: HELLO?

02:44.680 --> 02:45.980

02:46.080 --> 02:47.540
Pops: OH, BENSON, ARE YOU

02:47.640 --> 02:49.960
OKAY?
Benson: I'M FINE, POPS.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.880
LISTEN, COULD YOU PUT MORDECAI
AND RIGBY ON SO I CAN SCREAM AT

02:52.520 --> 02:53.660

02:53.760 --> 02:55.420
Pops: THEY'RE NOT WITH YOU?

02:55.520 --> 02:56.140
OH, DEAR.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.740
THEY DIDN'T COME HOME LAST

02:57.840 --> 03:00.280

WE'RE ALL WORRIED SICK.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.240
Benson: WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

03:02.120 --> 03:03.140
Pops: I'M AFRAID I DON'T

03:03.240 --> 03:03.660
KNOW.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.780
Benson: ( SIGHS )

03:04.880 --> 03:06.420
WELL, WHATEVER IT WAS LEFT ME

03:06.520 --> 03:07.780
STRANDED OUT IN THE DESERT.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.260
CAN YOU COME PICK ME UP?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.460
Pops: OH, OF COURSE.

Benson: CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT
ROAD THIS IS?

03:30.880 --> 03:31.540
SURE.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.420
HOW 'BOUT RIGHT AFTER YOU TELL

03:33.520 --> 03:35.340

Pops: BENSON?

03:40.680 --> 03:42.620
HELLO?

03:42.720 --> 03:44.060
Benson: WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU

03:44.160 --> 03:46.880
ARRESTING ME FOR?
Mordecai: BENSON, YOU'RE ALL

03:46.000 --> 03:48.280
RIGHT!
Benson: YOU!

03:47.400 --> 03:49.540
HEH, KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.320
Mordecai: AAAH!
Benson: WHAT DID YOU DO TO

03:51.680 --> 03:53.920
ME?
Mordecai: ( Choking ) DO YOU

03:53.120 --> 03:56.080
NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING?
Benson: NO!

03:54.840 --> 03:58.040
Mordecai: GET OFF OF ME AND
I'LL TELL YOU!

03:57.480 --> 03:58.500

03:58.600 --> 04:00.300
OH...OH...

04:00.400 --> 04:03.240
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Together: BENSON! BENSON!

04:02.520 --> 04:03.020
BENSON!

04:03.120 --> 04:04.460
Mordecai: THE WINGS JUST KEPT

04:04.560 --> 04:05.020
COMING.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.500
BOTH OF OUR ENGINES WERE ON

04:06.600 --> 04:08.140
FIRE, BUT SOMEHOW WE MANAGED TO

04:08.240 --> 04:09.820
CRASHâLAND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

04:09.920 --> 04:10.900
OF A HOTâTUB PARTY.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.260
Benson: I WISH I WAS COOL

04:12.360 --> 04:13.140
LIKE YOU GUYS.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.660
INSTEAD, I'M BEING HONORED

04:14.760 --> 04:16.100
TOMORROW FOR PLAYING IT SAFE.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.900
Rigby: OUCH.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.860
YEAH. THAT'S ROUGH.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.300
IF YOU WANT TO BE HONORED

04:19.400 --> 04:22.680
TOMORROW WITH SOME GRADEâA GUTS,
YOU SHOULD DRIVE UP TO THE

04:21.800 --> 04:23.260
CEREMONY IN THE MACH INFINITY.

04:23.360 --> 04:23.700
YEAH.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.260
IT'S THE SUPERSONIC CAR WE JUST

04:25.360 --> 04:27.880
TESTâDROVE.
Benson: SERIOUSLY?

04:27.120 --> 04:28.420
Mordecai: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

04:28.520 --> 04:31.560
CAR ACTUALLY EXISTED.
Rigby: NOTHING CAN DRIVE THAT

04:31.200 --> 04:33.520
FAST.
Benson: ( CHUCKLES )

04:32.800 --> 04:34.100
YOU'D BE TAKING A BIG RISK.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.100
BUT IN A COOL WAY.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.120
Rigby: I DON'T KNOW, BENSON.
Mordecai: YOU MIGHT BE

04:36.920 --> 04:39.880
RISKING MORE THAN JUST THAT GOLD
WATCH.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.660
Benson: IT'S WORTH IT!

04:40.760 --> 04:43.720
JUST MAKE SURE YOUR
LIFTâTOâDRAG RATIO STAYS LEVEL.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.000
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A
HIGHâG MANEUVER.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.380
Rigby: WHOOO!

04:46.480 --> 04:47.500
HIGHâG MANEUVER!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.060
Benson: ALL RIGHT.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.220
HERE GOES.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.620
( FOOSH! )

04:52.720 --> 04:56.700
AAH! AAAH! AAAAH!

04:56.800 --> 04:59.700
STOP! STOP! STOP!

04:59.800 --> 05:02.700
( THUD! )

05:02.800 --> 05:04.800
( WHOOSH! )

05:05.520 --> 05:06.500
THAT'S CRAZY.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.340
YEAH.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.640
YOU LANDED ABOUT A MILE AWAY,
BUT THE CAR KEPT GOING AND ENDED

05:09.920 --> 05:10.580
UP ON THE ROAD.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.460
Mordecai: YEAH.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.980
WHEN WE WENT TO GO FIND YOU, THE

05:13.080 --> 05:16.360
COP ARRESTED US FOR SPEEDING.
WE EVEN SHOWED HIM OUR

05:15.480 --> 05:19.040
GOVERNMENTâCLEARANCE CARD, WHICH
ALLOWS US TO SPEED, BUT HE JUST

05:18.360 --> 05:19.020
RIPPED IT UP.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.260
Rigby: HE WAS LIKE, "NYAH!

05:20.360 --> 05:20.820
NYAH!"

05:20.920 --> 05:21.740
Benson: ( SIGHS )

05:21.840 --> 05:23.020
I'LL GO TRY AND TALK TO THIS

05:23.120 --> 05:24.100
GUY.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.620
UH, HI, SIR?

05:25.720 --> 05:26.100
UM...

05:26.200 --> 05:28.060
I KIND OF HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE

05:28.160 --> 05:29.340
BY 9:00, AND ââ

05:29.440 --> 05:30.980
WELL, WE WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO

05:31.080 --> 05:32.420
BE LATE, NOW, WOULD WE?

05:32.520 --> 05:34.220
Benson: NO, WE WOULDN'T, SIR.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.420
WELL, SON, THE SOONEST I CAN

05:36.520 --> 05:38.580
OPEN THAT DOOR FOR YOU IS, UH,

05:38.680 --> 05:42.140
9:01 A.M.

05:42.240 --> 05:42.780
( CLANG! )

05:42.880 --> 05:46.000
Mordecai: YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT ANYTHING.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.000
YOU JUST MADE THAT TIME UP TO BE
A JERK.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.660
OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAIN, PRETTY

05:47.760 --> 05:50.840
BOY, AND YOU'RE GETTING THE
HOSE!

05:49.680 --> 05:50.820
Pops: THAT WON'T BE

05:50.920 --> 05:51.620
NECESSARY.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.700
Together: POPS!

05:52.800 --> 05:54.540
Benson: HOW DID YOU FIND US?

05:54.640 --> 05:55.900
Pops: OH, IT WAS QUITE

05:56.000 --> 05:56.580
SIMPLE.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.540
WHILE YOU WERE BEING ARRESTED, I

05:58.640 --> 06:00.460
HAPPENED TO HEAR THE DISTINCTIVE

06:00.560 --> 06:02.340
MATING CALL OF A CHUBBYâNECKED

06:02.440 --> 06:03.860
CHICKEN VULTURE IN THE

06:03.960 --> 06:06.600
BACKGROUND.
I TRIED TO USE YOUR COMPUTING

06:06.360 --> 06:08.100
DEVICE TO LOOK UP ITS HABITAT ON

06:08.200 --> 06:11.140
THE INTERNET, BUT I GOT SCARED.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.820
SO I CALLED THOMAS OVER AND HE

06:12.920 --> 06:14.540
FOUND IT WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE AT

06:14.640 --> 06:17.000
ALL.
Benson: WOW, POPS, THAT'S

06:16.480 --> 06:18.920
AMAZING.
Pops: NOW, OFFICER, PLEASE

06:18.440 --> 06:21.760
ALLOW ME TO PAY YOU WHATEVER
FINES THEY'VE ACCRUED AND WE'LL

06:21.320 --> 06:22.740
BE ON OUR MERRY WAY.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.180
ARE YOU TRYING TO BRIBE ME,

06:25.280 --> 06:25.620
SON?

06:25.720 --> 06:26.940
Pops: BRIBE?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.640
Together: POPS!
Mordecai: YOU CAN'T ARREST

06:28.880 --> 06:31.480
HIM FOR NO REASON!
Rigby: YEAH, YOU THINK YOU'RE

06:30.800 --> 06:33.640
ABOVE THE LAW?
ON THIS QUARTERâMILE STRETCH

06:33.720 --> 06:36.660
OF HIGHWAY, I AM THE LAW.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.340
( LAUGHS )

06:39.440 --> 06:41.620
Y'ALL SIT TIGHT WHILE I FIND THE

06:41.720 --> 06:44.380
BIGGER HOSE.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.580
Benson: ( SIGHS )

06:45.680 --> 06:47.500
WELL, YOU RUINED MY LIFE AGAIN.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.240
Rigby: WHAT?
WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!

06:49.720 --> 06:51.060
Benson: I WOKE UP IN A

06:51.160 --> 06:54.560
MILITARY JUMPSUIT, STRAPPED TO
AN EJECTOR SEAT.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.020
OF COURSE YOU HAD SOMETHING TO

06:55.120 --> 06:55.860
DO WITH THIS!

06:55.960 --> 06:56.860
WHOA, BENSON.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.620
NOBODY PUT THOSE WINGS INSIDE

06:58.720 --> 07:01.360
YOU BUT YOU.
JUST BECAUSE WE PARTY LIKE

07:01.000 --> 07:02.620
HANDSOME MANIACS DOESN'T MEAN

07:02.720 --> 07:03.900
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.220
Benson: ( SIGHS )

07:05.320 --> 07:08.160
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DECIDED TO TAKE RISKS, AND

07:08.240 --> 07:09.300
THIS IS THE PRICE I PAY.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.800
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING, BUT THIS
COP WON'T LISTEN TO REASON.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.500
MAYBE YOU CAN'T REASON YOUR

07:13.600 --> 07:14.500
WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.060
MAYBE THE SOLUTION IS...

07:17.160 --> 07:18.820
Benson: ANOTHER RISK.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.020
OKAY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.100
( WHISTLING )

07:21.200 --> 07:22.540
Pops: ( GROANING )

07:22.640 --> 07:24.100
WHAT IN TARNATION HAPPENED

07:24.200 --> 07:24.780
HERE?!

07:24.880 --> 07:26.700
Pops: OH, IT WAS TERRIBLE.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.780
THEY GANGED UP ON ME AND BEAT ME

07:28.880 --> 07:30.500
UP BEFORE THEY ESCAPED.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.420
ESCAPED?

07:31.520 --> 07:33.180
NOBODY ESCAPES FROM MY ââ

07:33.280 --> 07:34.300
Pops: NOW!

07:34.400 --> 07:35.940
WHAT?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.040
Mordecai: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT WORKED!

07:37.440 --> 07:40.480
Rigby: YEAH, I FIGURED POPS'
HEAD WOULD ONLY HIDE TWO OR

07:39.440 --> 07:42.200
THREE OF US, TOPS.
Mordecai: HOW MUCH TIME UNTIL

07:41.280 --> 07:43.920
THE CEREMONY?
Benson: LESS THAN AN HOUR.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.320
Pops: WE CAN TAKE CARMENITA.
Benson: SHE'S TOO SLOW.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.740
( CLEARS THROAT )

07:46.840 --> 07:48.180
IT'S YOUR ONLY CHANCE,

07:48.280 --> 07:48.820
BENSON.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.580
HOW BAD DO YOU WANT THAT

07:50.680 --> 07:53.080
WATCH?
Benson: MORE THAN ANYTHING.

07:52.920 --> 07:53.660
PERFECT.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.340
LET'S GO.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.440
Benson: SEE YOU AT THE
CEREMONY!

07:58.520 --> 07:59.260
WHAT?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
( THUD! )

08:03.400 --> 08:04.220
Benson: AH, COME ON!

08:04.320 --> 08:07.160
( ENGINE TURNS OVER )
YES!

08:05.840 --> 08:07.340
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

08:07.440 --> 08:09.440
( FOOSH! )

08:12.160 --> 08:14.900
IT TOOK ME 30 YEARS TO GROW THIS

08:15.000 --> 08:18.140
THING.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.660
( SIREN WAILS )

08:19.760 --> 08:20.780
( GUNSHOT )

08:20.880 --> 08:24.420
Benson: WHAT THE...?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.560
WHERE YOU GOING, BOY?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
NOOOOO!

08:39.920 --> 08:40.460
( CRASH! )

08:40.560 --> 08:41.260
Benson: AAAAH!

08:41.360 --> 08:44.020
( TIRES SCREECH )

08:44.120 --> 08:45.700
YES, I MADE IT.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.300
HEY, HOW DID YOU GUYS GET HERE

08:47.400 --> 08:47.980
BEFORE ME?

08:48.080 --> 08:48.580
( ALL GASP )

08:48.680 --> 08:50.180
Pops: IT'S A MIRACLE!

08:50.280 --> 08:51.340
Benson: WELL, I DON'T KNOW

08:51.440 --> 08:54.360
ABOUT MIRACLE, BUT...
Mordecai: DUDE, WHERE HAVE

08:53.720 --> 08:56.800
YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE
MONTHS?

08:55.160 --> 08:55.900
Benson: WHAT?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.280
WHAT PROBABLY HAPPENED IS
THAT YOU WENT SO FAST THAT YOU

08:58.800 --> 09:02.120
ACTUALLY TRAVELED THREE MONTHS
INTO THE FUTURE.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.880
Rigby: WE ALL THOUGHT YOU
WERE DEAD, MAN.

09:02.520 --> 09:07.800
Benson: THEN IF THIS ISN'T MY
GOLDâWATCH CEREMONY, IT'S MY...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.620
Skips: MEMORIAL SERVICE.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.940
Benson: AND WHO ARE ALL OF

09:11.040 --> 09:13.480
THESE GUYS?
Skips: THEY'RE APPLICANTS FOR

09:12.640 --> 09:15.840
THE PARK MANAGER POSITION.
THEY'RE WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE

09:15.000 --> 09:17.100
SERVICE TO BE INTERVIEWED.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.540
Benson: MR. MAELLARD, ABOUT

09:18.640 --> 09:21.280
THE GOLD WATCH...
UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.940
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STICKLER FOR

09:23.040 --> 09:25.560
THE RULES.
Rigby: HEY, MAN, AT LEAST

09:24.560 --> 09:27.080
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.
Benson: NO.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.140
WITHOUT THAT WATCH, I AM DEAD.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.420
( ENGINE TURNS OVER )

09:30.520 --> 09:31.740
Both: BENSON! STOP!

09:31.840 --> 09:33.580
THE INFINITY'S REVERSE GEAR

09:33.680 --> 09:35.500
COULD TEAR A HOLE IN SPACEâTIME!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.300
Benson: I HAVE TO TAKE THAT

09:37.400 --> 09:37.980
CHANCE!

09:38.080 --> 09:38.820
( FOOSH! )

09:38.920 --> 09:40.340
NOW, THERE GOES A MAN WHO

09:40.440 --> 09:44.700
TAKES RISKS.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.800
Benson: COME ON.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.540
I...I NEVER KNEW.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.140
AAAAAAH!

10:00.240 --> 10:03.420
IT'S WORKING!

10:03.520 --> 10:05.340
AAAH!

10:05.440 --> 10:07.740
AAAAAH!

10:07.840 --> 10:10.100
AAAAAAH!

10:10.200 --> 10:11.420
( WHOOSH! )

10:11.520 --> 10:12.580
Muscle Man: TOLD YOU HE'D

10:12.680 --> 10:15.280
MAKE IT.
9:00 A.M. ON THE DOT.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.060
YOU DID IT, MY BOY.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.240
Benson: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Muscle Man: I BROUGHT US SOME

10:20.480 --> 10:23.600
WINGS TO HELP US CELEBRATE.
Benson: ( CHUCKLES )

10:22.600 --> 10:24.220
SORRY, MUSCLE MAN, NOT THIS

10:24.320 --> 10:24.860
TIME.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.780
COME ON, IT'S ONLY ONE WING.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.700
Benson: WELL...

10:28.800 --> 10:30.820
OH, MY HEAD.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.540
WHERE...?

10:32.640 --> 10:34.640
AW, COME ON!
