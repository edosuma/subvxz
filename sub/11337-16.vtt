WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.170
Fan out.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.172
And talk to me.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.241
(steam hissing, man groaning)

00:13.080 --> 00:14.747
ED (over radio):
We need an entrance, people.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.282
Every window
on green wall's secure.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.718
Bars and grates.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.286
JULES:
<i> Same on red.</i>

00:21.288 --> 00:22.755
<i> We're on black wall now. </i>
(gasping)

00:24.191 --> 00:26.458
Same on white.
The only way

00:26.460 --> 00:28.193
we're getting in there
is with a cutting torch.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.062
Come on, people,
we got to get in here.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.364
(ticking)

00:33.634 --> 00:35.668
MAN:
<i>Traffic and weather on the 10's</i>

00:35.669 --> 00:37.703
<i> going to be heavy both ways</i>
<i> with two right lanes blocked</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:39.571
(phone ringing)
eastbound at Jameson.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.507
Emergency crews
are on the scene.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.410
You can use Lakeshore
as an alternative.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.644
Parkway is running trouble-free.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.147
The 401 Express
and collector not too bad.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.149
Some slowdowns near the 400.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.184
Weather forecast:
gray skies today,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.153
humid, some showers and maybe...

00:54.155 --> 00:57.122
(siren wailing)

00:57.124 --> 00:59.124
This is the softest area--
right there.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.492
He's right.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.827
Please, we start here.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.328
We're way better covered.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.496
Give it up, Patton.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.265
He's still right.
You know what?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.333
You got a thing for Wordy, okay?
No, no, that's what it is.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.835
Ed, best entry point today.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.337
Best P.O.E.
First one, obviously.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.639
You got a thing
for Wordy, too.
Who doesn't?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.808
But the first one
is still the right P.O.E.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.843
Okay, guys, go day
on this warrant.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.211
To recap,

01:19.213 --> 01:21.113
El Coleros "President"
Tony Pranso--

01:21.115 --> 01:22.214
he's wanted
for racketeering,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.715
attempted murder,
the list goes on.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.184
We go in tonight.
(phone ringing)

01:25.186 --> 01:26.852
Close Quarters Battlehouse drill
30 minutes.

01:27.822 --> 01:29.188
Hey, boss.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.289
PARKER:
Hey, Eddie, something come up.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.523
I'm going to be a little late.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.524
Anything serious?

01:32.526 --> 01:33.659
Uh, just some personal stuff.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.227
Be about an hour.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.229
Okay. Anything I can do?
No, it's fine.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.447
I'm fine.

01:38.448 --> 01:39.664
Just see you in an hour.
Okay, boss.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.766
All right.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.802
Guys, change of plan.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.771
We do the drill in an hour, 30.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.805
All right.
(claps)

01:46.807 --> 01:48.340
Free time.
ED:
Not likely.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.608
Outside 15 minutes.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.276
Full gear. Let's go.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.778
We're doing sprints.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.589
Hey.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.324
You looking
to score?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.226
No, I'm looking
for a friend.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.260
Well, maybe I can help.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.395
I know everybody around here.

02:10.397 --> 02:11.630
No, but thanks.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.865
You sure I can't...

02:12.867 --> 02:14.233
(groans)

02:14.235 --> 02:15.334
Oh, God.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.202
(groaning)
You all right?

02:17.204 --> 02:19.238
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I'm fine. I...

02:19.240 --> 02:21.306
Not fine.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.642
It's okay. You're all right.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.377
It's okay. It's okay.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.446
I'm going to call 911.
I'm going to get you help.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.747
OPERATOR:
911. what is your emergency?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.849
My name is Sergeant Greg Parker.
I'm with the SRU.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.317
There's a possible overdose

02:32.319 --> 02:33.852
in an alley
at Shuter

02:33.854 --> 02:35.354
and Victoria.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.222
(grunting)

02:39.193 --> 02:40.792
Hey. Hey!

02:40.794 --> 02:42.427
What about me?!

02:42.429 --> 02:44.263
(tires screeching)

02:49.170 --> 02:50.435
Sir?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.703
Sir, are you still there?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.706
<i> 911. What is your emergency?</i>

02:54.708 --> 02:56.341
My name is Sergeant Greg Parker.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.643
I'm with the SRU.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.311
There's a possible overdose

02:59.313 --> 03:02.748
in an alley
at Shuter and Victoria.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.283
OPERATOR:
Sir?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.417
Sir, are you still there?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.252
Maybe the boss
just dropped his phone.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.887
Then, why didn't he
pick it up again?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.189
Any answer?

03:10.191 --> 03:12.191
No, no. Runs straight
to voice mail.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.759
Shuter and Victoria--
it's a sketchy area.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.294
Boss can take care
of himself.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.846
JULES:
But why is he there?

03:16.847 --> 03:18.397
Yeah, did he tell you
what he was up to?

03:18.399 --> 03:19.531
Let's go for a drive.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.844
You're making
a mistake.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.846
Lock the door.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.321
I don't know you.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.756
Shut up!

03:44.758 --> 03:45.824
Come on. Let's go.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.538
PARKER:
If this is about
your business--

03:59.540 --> 04:02.474
what you do here--
I don't know anything about it.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.543
It's about the
money, genius.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.411
Money?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.347
That's right--
you play stupid,

04:08.348 --> 04:10.282
and then maybe we can beat
some smarts into you.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.783
Isn't that right?

04:11.785 --> 04:13.385
Yeah.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.953
Absolutely right.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.489
(sirens wailing)

04:29.603 --> 04:31.370
Wordy, grab those two.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.504
See if they saw anything.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.439
No blood,
no sign of a struggle.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.475
Doesn't mean there wasn't one.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.543
Car's unlocked.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.545
What, in this
neighborhood?

04:40.547 --> 04:42.547
Pop that trunk.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.486
WORDY:
Excuse me.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.521
You got the master?
I got it.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.526
Gun's still in there.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.727
He wasn't expecting trouble.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.729
Anybody seen his cell?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.064
No.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.532
Can we
locate it?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.566
Can if it's on.
Let's do it.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.613
I got to go
make a call.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.581
If he tries anything,

05:16.583 --> 05:18.550
you know what to do.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.919
Mm-hmm.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.524
No mistakes, Tyler.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.491
Don't worry about me.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.060
I got it all together.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.832
First time with
a gun, son?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.501
Lot easier to hold steady
with two hands.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.036
I've shot plenty of guns.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.839
Okay. Do you mind just pointing
it off a little to my left?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.507
Sure.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.509
You think I'm stupid?
No.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.045
Sir, I think you're smart.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.448
You know how
easy it is

05:49.450 --> 05:51.450
for a gun to go off by mistake.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.784
Your finger twitches,

05:52.786 --> 05:55.387
and the gun
goes off.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.521
What would
your buddy do

05:56.523 --> 05:57.923
if you made a
mistake like that?

06:02.396 --> 06:03.995
Thank you, son.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.466
(siren wailing)

06:07.468 --> 06:09.601
SPIKE:
Here, just to the right.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.669
Moving slowly,

06:10.671 --> 06:12.604
probably on foot.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.539
You've got to be kidding me.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.949
Where's the cell phone?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.650
I look like I got a phone?

06:25.652 --> 06:26.985
You got a name?

06:26.987 --> 06:29.054
Everyone's
got a name.
(dialing)

06:29.056 --> 06:31.056
It's Glynnis.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.525
(phone ringing)

06:34.595 --> 06:36.128
Well, Glynnis,
where'd you get this?

06:36.130 --> 06:37.662
GLYNNIS:
Not mine.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.664
Never saw it before.
Did you pick it up

06:39.666 --> 06:41.500
on the street?
Did you see
who dropped it, Glynnis?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.068
He doesn't need it anymore.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.437
Why is that?
'Cause he's dead.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.140
GLYNNIS:
Someone hit him.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.975
Did you see
who hit him?
No.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.810
But I saw
the snake man push him.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.145
I saw that.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.980
What snake man, Glynnis?

06:54.982 --> 06:56.681
Snake.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.049
Around his neck.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.685
You know.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.087
Where did they go?

07:02.089 --> 07:04.623
Away, in... in a van.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.657
Okay, van, good.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.892
What color?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.493
Black.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.895
Nice ride.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.962
Okay.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.431
Thanks, Glynnis.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.566
Come on, man,
let's do this.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.635
We're waiting for somebody.
What?

07:16.637 --> 07:17.869
This isn't a party, man.
Come on.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.438
Okay, just so
we're clear,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.173
you two have kidnapped,
assaulted

07:21.174 --> 07:22.907
and are now unlawfully detaining
a police officer.

07:22.910 --> 07:23.942
Hey, shut up.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.477
You're a cop?

07:25.479 --> 07:27.463
This guy's a cop?

07:27.464 --> 07:29.448
Yeah, just... it doesn't matter
who he is, okay?

07:29.450 --> 07:30.849
You said that he owed you money.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.118
You said...
He lied to you, Tyler?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.086
All the risks you're taking,
and he lied to you?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.621
Yo, man.
Tyler, Tyler.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.623
Do I take good care of you?
Yeah.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.858
Then, just trust me.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.760
Do what I say, and
everything will be okay.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.495
PARKER:
You think that, Tyler?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.698
You think kidnapping
a cop is okay?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.799
Shut up!

08:02.015 --> 08:04.015
You killed him.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.650
No, I didn't.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.785
(panting)

08:08.689 --> 08:10.755
Not yet.

08:12.693 --> 08:16.828
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:49.930 --> 08:51.997
(banging at door)

08:55.235 --> 08:56.668
Where's Kevin?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.936
What the hell are
you doing here?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.170
Kevin called me.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.039
Where is he?

09:04.611 --> 09:06.311
(locks latching)

09:06.313 --> 09:09.614
The hell is going on, Tyler?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.884
Come on.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.786
So, you and Kev
hanging again?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.987
Yeah, we're tight.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.756
What do you want
from me?

09:17.758 --> 09:18.957
From you, Tyler?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.825
Believe me-- nothing.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.694
So, you guys
are hooking up again?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.895
Business is
it of yours?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.202
Oh, my God. Greg.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.675
About an hour ago,
boss got this.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.012
Haley? Haley?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.180
Do you know her?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.982
Could be a friend,
another cop.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.750
A girlfriend?
ED:
I don't think so.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.018
I don't know.
JULES:
Spike, are there

09:47.020 --> 09:49.120
any other calls or messages
from this Haley?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.789
Nothing.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.091
All right, we need to check

09:52.092 --> 09:53.392
phone records, texts,
anywhere this woman

09:53.393 --> 09:54.693
got a hold
of him.
Most of that takes time.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.927
E-mails-- can you get
into those?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.312
Okay, I can
do that,

09:57.313 --> 09:58.696
but I have to
access it remotely.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.699
He's only got, like, a
week's worth on his PDA.
Do it.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.201
All right, it's been 30 minutes
since the 911 call.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.769
They got a big
head start on us.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.771
We got a lot
of ground to cover.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.607
Wordy, get on the horn--
every cop.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.041
I don't care
if they're a meter maid,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.776
behind a desk, on vacation.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.846
Everybody on the street
looking for the boss<i> now.</i>

10:14.848 --> 10:16.748
You know this guy?
Go get Kevin.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.783
I have to watch the cop.
Now!

10:18.785 --> 10:19.784
Fine.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.153
You watch him.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.822
Greg. Greg, look at me.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.107
Are you okay?

10:25.108 --> 10:26.391
Haley, you have
to get out of here.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.259
You have to get out of here,
get out.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.362
What are you
doing here?

10:30.364 --> 10:32.697
What are<i> you </i>
doing here?

10:32.699 --> 10:35.367
I got a message
from you

10:35.369 --> 10:36.935
saying that you were in trouble.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.803
I never sent anything.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.672
Okay.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.374
Come on,
we got to get you out of here.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.708
Okay, we need a knife.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.427
You need something sharp.

10:45.428 --> 10:47.145
You need a pin or a needle
or something.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.281
Oh, God, there's nothing.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.416
(sighing):
Okay.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.784
Use your earrings.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.154
Huh?
Use the point
of your earrings.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.923
All right, now pull
and slide it in there.
Yeah.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.792
Really? Okay, good.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.728
I'm really trying to understand
what's going on here, Haley.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.431
It's Kevin.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.733
It's Kevin?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.902
He's hated you
ever since we broke up.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.270
Your ex-boyfriend Kevin?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.272
Okay.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.974
Let's go.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.178
Let's go.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.714
All right,
up, up, up, up, up.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.052
SPIKE (over headset):
Ed, got her. Mystery woman
Go.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.887
is Hayley Brynne,
18 years old.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.456
That rules out girlfriend.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.092
Hey, you think you
know somebody.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.894
We know the boss.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.462
ED:
Go on, Spike.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.797
Correspondence
goes way back,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.699
so whatever it is,
they got a history.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.401
You read the e-mails?
No, just to confirm the name.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.870
But so far, I've got nothing
on the girl.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.489
Hold on.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.107
We got a news article,
ten years ago.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.077
Homicide served a warrant
on a suspect, Randy Teller.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.412
Subject opened fire on police.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.347
"Tessy Brynne

11:56.349 --> 11:57.982
"among those killed
in the cross fire.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.885
Ranking officer on the scene,
Detective Greg Parker."

12:00.887 --> 12:02.787
"Detective"?
Yeah,

12:02.789 --> 12:04.022
back when he was in Homicide.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.457
Time fits.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.827
What the hell are
you doing down there?

12:08.829 --> 12:11.062
Just getting the lab ready.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.503
I told you to watch him.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.004
Yeah, and then
you called her.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.339
What the hell is that about?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.241
We find them right now!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.177
Open the file.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.512
(keyboard clacking)

12:27.514 --> 12:29.013
(beeping)

12:29.015 --> 12:30.949
No, I can't. It's sealed.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.651
What?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.352
Why?
I don't know. It's sealed.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.020
If it's sealed,
we need a court order.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.123
Could take days.
We don't have days.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.858
JULES (over headset):
Ed, we all know that.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.526
Okay.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.961
All right,
see if you can get

12:42.963 --> 12:45.230
one of those lawyers
to unseal it-- for now.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.431
Copy.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.100
It's like a fortress.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.069
Here!
Hayley, stop!

12:51.071 --> 12:53.104
Stop. Stop.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.909
Place like this,
lots of surprises.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.111
What do you mean
a "place like this"?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.847
You don't know?
I've never been here.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.883
I haven't seen
Kevin in months.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.519
It's a meth lab, Hayley.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.921
See the propane tanks
when you came in?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.856
All the brass
turned blue?

13:13.059 --> 13:14.859
Smell that?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.861
I thought it was cats.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.398
KEVIN:
The doors are all closed.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.966
Maybe down here.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.273
Up on the roof. There's
got to be a door there.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.008
Go on.
Go, go, go, go.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.055
I've got a last-known on Hayley.
It's a group home in Riverdale.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.157
And I've got the social worker
on line two.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.425
Okay, good.
I'll talk to her.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.093
And Spike, get me
those e-mails.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.862
Copy.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.932
So you're saying you knew
about the two of them?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.517
The e-mails?

13:55.518 --> 13:57.101
WOMAN (on phone):
The e-mails, the visits,
the phone calls.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.504
Hayley practically
worshipped him.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.039
I guess it's not surprising,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.173
considering
what he did for her.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.408
What do you know about that?

14:03.410 --> 14:04.576
Just what Hayley told me.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.077
She was eight.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.979
Her mother was an addict.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.981
They lived in a flophouse.

14:09.983 --> 14:13.418
The cops came by with a warrant
for her boyfriend one night.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.353
<i> I guess he didn't</i>
<i> feel like cooperating.</i>

14:15.355 --> 14:18.022
<i> All Hayley said she could</i>
<i> remember was the sounds.</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:20.191
WOMAN:
Get away!

14:20.193 --> 14:22.460
Baby, get under the bed.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.128
Get under the bed!

14:24.130 --> 14:26.197
(gunshots)
Oh, no, they're coming.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.498
(gunshots, glass breaking)

14:27.500 --> 14:28.967
(indistinct shouting)

14:28.969 --> 14:30.134
Get it.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.202
Baby, get the gun.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.010
(sighs)

14:39.012 --> 14:41.045
<i> She was eight.</i>

14:41.047 --> 14:42.413
<i> I can't imagine.</i>

14:56.029 --> 14:58.263
It's okay.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.169
I got you.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.672
<i> He covered her up.</i>

15:07.674 --> 15:09.440
<i> Wouldn't let her</i>
<i> out of his sight</i>

15:09.442 --> 15:11.342
till Children's Aid showed up.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.544
A lot of cops wouldn't have
done that, but he did.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.280
Yeah, that sounds like Greg.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.082
Later, Hayley had some
drug problems of her own.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.152
But Greg would come by,
just talk to her.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.054
Once she

15:23.056 --> 15:25.390
broke up with Kevin,
she got back on track.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.557
Kevin who?

15:26.559 --> 15:27.926
Persheski.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.560
Long line of meth heads.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.362
She met him in the program.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.965
And he was no fan of Greg's.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.600
Thanks for your help.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.035
(phone beeps off)

15:45.078 --> 15:46.244
What are you
doing here, Hayley?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.279
I thought you were
done with Kevin.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.715
We talked about that.
I was. I am.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.151
But he called.
He said he needed help.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.219
You bought it?
Didn't you?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.661
Another grenade.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.229
That's a smart kid.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.533
Hey. Oh, no-no-no-no.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.201
Oh, we're going to be okay.
(crying)

16:10.203 --> 16:12.203
I promise. All right?

16:12.205 --> 16:13.638
See these windows?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.206
We're going to pull
on one of the bars

16:15.208 --> 16:16.708
and we're going
to get out of here.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.345
KEVIN:
Hayley.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.080
You came.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.284
SPIKE:
<i> Guys, I think I got something.</i>
<i> Came up blank</i>

16:26.286 --> 16:28.486
on Kevin Persheski,
and if he's Hayley's age,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.188
a juvie record will come
up sealed, too.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.423
But group home lady
said he comes

16:32.425 --> 16:35.126
from a long line of meth heads,
so I cross-checked.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.128
And this is Joe Persheski.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.564
Multiple convictions,
possession with intent

16:39.566 --> 16:41.165
to distribute, assault,

16:41.167 --> 16:42.567
assault with a deadly weapon.

16:42.569 --> 16:46.170
And around his neck, the tattoo
the old woman described.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.538
ED (over headset):
Snakeman.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.390
Nice work, Spike.

16:49.391 --> 16:51.241
Call Drug Squad, see if you
can get a last-known address.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.077
Copy that.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.246
Hey, just take
it easy, son.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.381
Hayley, you stay behind me.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.216
Kevin, what are you doing?

16:58.218 --> 17:01.152
It's okay, Haley, okay?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.021
Just come here.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.190
Come here.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.625
PARKER:
We can talk

17:07.626 --> 17:09.059
this out, whatever
the problem is...
Shut up!

17:09.062 --> 17:10.028
No.
It's okay.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.629
Shut up.
Stop. Stop.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.231
Everything's going to be okay

17:13.233 --> 17:14.799
as long as we listen
to each other.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.567
All right?
If you think
that Greg is the reason

17:16.569 --> 17:20.271
we broke up, you're wrong.
No, this isn't about us
breaking up.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.775
This is about him
telling you the truth, Hale.

17:23.777 --> 17:26.110
About who really killed your ma.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.525
Don't you want to know, Hale?

17:40.527 --> 17:43.795
Who really
killed your ma?

17:43.797 --> 17:45.696
You're high.
No.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.698
No, I'm not.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.168
Kevin, but you are in trouble.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.236
I can see that
and Hayley can see that.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.638
She cares about you.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.140
She cares about you,
and whoever she cares about,

17:56.142 --> 17:59.277
I care about, too.
Yeah, yeah, you care.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.779
Listen.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.115
As soon as you know it,
it's all going to be over, okay?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.716
HALEY:
Know what?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.418
No, Kevin, please.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.220
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't do this...

18:09.222 --> 18:10.655
It's for his own sake!

18:10.657 --> 18:13.257
'Cause I swear to God,
if he comes at me

18:13.259 --> 18:14.392
one more time,
I'm going to kill him.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.760
You don't want to do that, son.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.161
What do I want to do?

18:17.163 --> 18:19.697
Hmm? Hayley always said
you can look

18:19.699 --> 18:22.300
in someone's eyes and you can
tell them what's going on.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.602
So you tell me.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.873
What do I want to do?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.762
Police!
(indistinct shouting)

18:51.764 --> 18:53.197
Everyone down!

18:53.199 --> 18:55.266
Face down on the ground!

18:55.268 --> 18:58.169
Everybody down on the ground!
Get down!
Get down!

18:58.171 --> 18:59.570
Get down!

18:59.572 --> 19:01.839
Stay where you are! Hey!

19:03.209 --> 19:05.143
Stay down.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.777
Ed.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.249
Where is he?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.217
Where is he?

19:17.357 --> 19:20.191
Oh, you've been making
meth again, Kevin?

19:20.193 --> 19:21.492
Is that what you
want Haley to know?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.394
I want you to know
who he really is.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.229
I know who he is.
Hey, man.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.631
If you got a beef with me,
take it up with me.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.899
Haley doesn't have to be

19:27.900 --> 19:29.166
a part of it.
Put him on the ground.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.201
Tie him to the table.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.502
HAYLEY:
Why are you doing this?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.607
Just... tell me what
you think happened.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.776
I know what happened.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.945
There was a party.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.948
My Mom was high, everyone was.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.185
She had a gun.
When the cops

19:47.187 --> 19:49.754
came in, everyone
started shooting at them.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.224
And my mom got hit
by a bullet, from one

19:53.226 --> 19:54.509
of the junkie's guns.

19:54.510 --> 19:55.793
How do you know that?
Who told you that?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.228
Greg did.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.863
Right.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.232
Big hero.
Hey, man, I'm just
looking out for her.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.500
Trying to help.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.302
You got someone to
look out for you?

20:04.304 --> 20:05.570
Kevin, you got folks
to take care of you?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.904
What do you know
about my folks?!

20:06.906 --> 20:08.839
Greg took care of me.
He cared about me.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.308
Leave leave him alone!
What did I do?

20:10.310 --> 20:13.377
What did I do?
It's what you
didn't do, Kevin.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.446
You didn't get better.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.515
You gave up.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.718
I never gave up on us.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.553
PARKER:
That's it,
Kevin, come on.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.488
We can tell you care about her.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.490
So if you care about her,
what's all this for?

20:26.492 --> 20:29.327
Huh? You can see what
it's doing to her.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.396
When I met Haley, she was coming
off a year-long binge.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.265
You know that?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.833
'Cause every night
she'd go to sleep,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.235
she'd see her ma,

20:37.237 --> 20:38.803
dead on the floor
in front of her.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.571
I know that.
Right.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.007
So you probably
know this name, too.

20:43.009 --> 20:43.908
Huh? Randy Teller?

20:44.744 --> 20:45.910
Who the hell is that?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.245
He's the man we came to arrest

20:47.247 --> 20:48.746
that night.
Yeah.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.715
Now, he's in for life,
because of "that night."

20:50.717 --> 20:53.284
'Cause he opened fire
on us, Kevin.
That's what, that's what

20:53.286 --> 20:55.486
Hayley remembers,
but the thing is, is that

20:55.488 --> 20:59.790
um, after, uh, Hayley
and I took a break,

20:59.792 --> 21:01.959
I still really wanted
to help her.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.527
And that's a good thing, Kevin.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.796
So I, uh, I went to see Randy.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.965
And I asked him,
I asked him what the hell

21:07.967 --> 21:09.367
happened that night?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.602
I mean, uh...

21:12.538 --> 21:14.405
how did her ma die, really?

21:14.407 --> 21:16.440
You know what he told me?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.342
He said, um...

21:18.344 --> 21:19.543
"I was downstairs.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.413
"I didn't really
see who shot her.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.650
But I know who was up there
with her when it happened."
Okay, wait.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.884
Wait, wait, wait, Kevin.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.419
Okay? All right?

21:28.420 --> 21:29.953
A guy like that,
he's going to tell you anything

21:29.956 --> 21:31.489
you want to hear.
Uh-uh.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.824
Yeah.
Uh-uh, Randy and my dad,
they go way back.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.326
Okay, he wouldn't
lie to me.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.595
He wouldn't lie to me.
What did he say?

21:37.597 --> 21:40.598
He said the cops and everybody

21:40.600 --> 21:42.833
were shooting
like crazy downstairs.

21:42.835 --> 21:46.470
And upstairs
was just your ma

21:46.472 --> 21:48.539
and him.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.945
Get out of our house!

21:54.947 --> 21:56.447
(indistinct shouting)
Get away!

21:56.449 --> 21:57.915
Leave us alone!

21:57.917 --> 21:59.483
Baby, get
under the bed.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.484
Get under the bed!

22:00.486 --> 22:01.485
(distant gunshots)

22:01.487 --> 22:02.486
Oh, God,
they're coming.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.487
(glass shatters)

22:03.489 --> 22:04.855
Leave us alone!

22:04.857 --> 22:06.324
(distant shouting, gunfire)

22:06.326 --> 22:08.025
(loud gunshot)

22:13.599 --> 22:16.467
PARKER:
No, no, no, that's
not how it happened.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.002
Randy wasn't even there.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.070
How could he know?

22:19.072 --> 22:21.072
Well, who else
could it be, Greg?

22:21.074 --> 22:23.341
Greg, it's not true.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.342
It's not true.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.343
The cops said that...

22:25.345 --> 22:27.011
The cops?
The cops?

22:27.012 --> 22:28.678
Have you ever tried to look
at this case? It's sealed.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.381
The cops are trying
to cover their own ass.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.733
I mean, who you gonna blame

22:31.734 --> 22:33.084
for shooting the mother
of a little girl,

22:33.086 --> 22:35.052
the cops or
some junkie?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.754
Who do you believe?

22:36.756 --> 22:37.855
Greg, please tell me

22:37.857 --> 22:39.824
that you didn't...

22:39.826 --> 22:41.826
KEVIN:
Yeah, who was it, Greg?

22:41.828 --> 22:44.695
What happened that night?!

22:49.902 --> 22:51.869
JOE:
Do what you want to me;
I got nothing to say.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.871
I'm not gonna do
anything to you.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.439
Okay, that's good.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.006
I'm just gonna put you in
a squad car, drive you around

22:57.009 --> 22:59.043
for a little while, while
all your little buddies here

22:59.045 --> 23:00.978
get busted for
possession, resisting,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.513
that kind of thing.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.047
And then you can explain
to them why they all have

23:04.050 --> 23:06.917
court dates and you're
running around scot-free.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.437
I'm sure they're
gonna understand.

23:09.438 --> 23:11.956
Maybe I know something,
about some kids doing wrong.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.057
Not that I condone
it, you understand.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.693
I just have
a condition.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.062
Well, you help us find our guy,
and we'll work it out.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.730
It's my condition,
you understand?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.731
I'm not bad.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.099
Not like these kids.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.618
I'm not gonna ask you again.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.136
It's a meth lab.
I can tell you where it is.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.437
You're gonna show us.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.038
JOE:
Sure, sure.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.040
You know, it's these kids,
I'm telling you.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.175
Tyler-- he's the crazy one.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.076
Kevin's not so bad.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.077
He's the brains.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.479
Get him out of here.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.880
A good looking boy, at least.
Go, go.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.815
Uh, my side of the family.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.786
Why didn't you just
tell me?!

23:42.755 --> 23:44.922
Because it's the truth.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.824
The truth is,
he never cared about you.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.427
No, Greg did care.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.060
He saved me.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.596
He kept me together.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.665
You know the answer to that.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.967
I didn't keep you together,
you kept me together.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.872
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

24:01.874 --> 24:05.976
It means that you, me and Haley,
we're not so different, okay?

24:05.978 --> 24:08.579
I know what it's like
to want to hide.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.782
I know what it's like to
make yourself feel numb.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.684
And the night that
I found Haley

24:13.686 --> 24:17.455
under that bed, I was a mess.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.524
I mean, the stuff you see
every day as a cop,

24:20.526 --> 24:24.028
on the job, makes you want
to make some bad choices.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.229
And mine was the bottle.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.233
That night,
after everything,

24:29.235 --> 24:33.471
I hit that bottle harder
than I ever had before.

24:33.473 --> 24:38.142
And when I woke up,
my family was gone.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.660
My wife was gone.

24:39.661 --> 24:41.177
She took my son;
he was six years old.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.246
I haven't seen them since.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.881
So?

24:43.883 --> 24:44.882
Is that her fault?

24:44.884 --> 24:45.883
Is that what
you're saying?

24:45.885 --> 24:48.118
No.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.520
No, that's my fault.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.821
That's my fault.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.990
Well, I took a
leave from the job.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.892
Holed up at home,
case of vodka

24:54.894 --> 24:58.596
and a promise:
either I finish these bottles

24:58.598 --> 24:59.663
or they finish me.

25:01.634 --> 25:05.069
And then I got
this letter,

25:05.071 --> 25:07.671
out of nowhere.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.740
In kid's handwriting.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.179
"Hi, Detective Parker.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.147
"It's me, Haley.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.549
(sobbing softly)

25:18.551 --> 25:19.850
"And I wanted to say

25:19.852 --> 25:23.287
thank you for helping me."

25:23.289 --> 25:25.923
And she was scared,

25:25.925 --> 25:29.093
but she was gonna be brave.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.162
An eight-
year-old girl.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.934
Took me three days to sober up.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.969
And then, that's when
I wrote you back.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.607
Everything I ever did
for you, you did for me.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.075
Okay?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.176
And what
happened after

25:46.178 --> 25:49.079
that night, what you've become,

25:49.081 --> 25:52.616
what I've seen you turn into,
Haley, that's,

25:52.618 --> 25:54.785
that's what matters.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.954
So all this time
was just because of

25:56.956 --> 25:59.156
what you did to my mom
that night?

25:59.158 --> 26:00.891
No, Haley.

26:00.893 --> 26:01.959
(sobbing)

26:07.867 --> 26:09.333
Big gate at the front.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.901
Don't know
how you're getting through.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.336
That shouldn't
be a problem.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.104
All right, guys,
hard vehicle entry.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.340
JOE:
Turn coming up.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.676
SPIKE:
<i> Looking at a highly</i>
<i> volatile environment.</i>

26:18.678 --> 26:20.578
<i> Air could have anything</i>
<i> in it, from acetone</i>

26:20.580 --> 26:22.947
to red phosphorous,
isopropyl alcohol.

26:22.949 --> 26:23.948
Everything's flammable

26:23.950 --> 26:25.182
<i> and unstable, guys.</i>

26:25.184 --> 26:26.283
JULES:
<i> Guns, rams, C.S. gas,</i>

26:26.285 --> 26:27.751
they all give off a spark.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.919
(cell phone ringing)

26:28.921 --> 26:30.187
Go for Lane.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.789
JIM:
Got your message, Ed.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.856
Jim Keach.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.224
What the hell's
going on with Greg?

26:34.226 --> 26:35.759
ED:
Hey, Jim, we got

26:35.761 --> 26:37.795
a situation here.
We don't have a lot of time.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.363
Listen, you remember
about ten years ago,

26:39.365 --> 26:40.998
you and Greg were partner
in Homicide,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.300
You had a case, and a woman
named Brynne got shot.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.653
Do you remember that?
Yeah, what about it?

26:45.654 --> 26:48.005
The little girl in that case, we
think she's involved here today.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.373
We need to know what happened

26:49.375 --> 26:50.674
that night.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.242
Case file is sealed
on that one, Ed.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.243
I know that, Jim.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.345
So you're the only one

26:54.347 --> 26:56.080
who can tell me the whole story.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.314
I don't think Greg's gonna mind,

26:57.316 --> 26:58.682
considering what's
going on here.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.217
Yeah, I don't know
about that one, Ed.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.353
But seeing as how Greg was
the one who sealed it

27:02.355 --> 27:03.687
in the first place...
He did?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.789
Yeah.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.124
Well, can you tell me why?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.759
Had his reasons.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.895
Main thing I remember
is the poster

27:11.897 --> 27:13.864
in that girl's room.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.133
We'd been after Teller
three months.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.868
Warrant came through
that night...

27:17.870 --> 27:19.269
Haley. Haley, listen to me.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.704
Listen to me.

27:20.706 --> 27:23.774
I think she's heard
enough from you, Greg.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.211
All right, Hale?

27:27.213 --> 27:28.779
Maybe I blew it between us.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.849
But maybe now I can
make something right.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.151
'Cause now,
we take care of this,

27:34.153 --> 27:36.687
maybe you can have some peace.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.222
Put those nightmares
behind you finally.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.124
Haley, get out of here.
Get out of here.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.359
KEVIN:
You think I'm gonna
hurt her, Greg?

27:42.361 --> 27:43.894
I'm doing this for her.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.796
For her?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.398
What's it gonna be like when

27:47.400 --> 27:48.566
the three of
you are up

27:48.567 --> 27:49.733
on charges for killing
a police officer?

27:49.735 --> 27:51.068
No, what's gonna happen is,

27:51.070 --> 27:52.936
is that we're gonna be gone,

27:52.938 --> 27:54.738
this place is gonna blow,

27:54.740 --> 27:56.373
and all they're
gonna find is some cop

27:56.375 --> 27:58.242
who shouldn't
have been

27:58.244 --> 27:59.843
snooping around
a volatile meth lab!

27:59.845 --> 28:01.245
Haley, you can't be
a part of this.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.680
You have to go
to the police.

28:02.682 --> 28:03.747
You can't
take a life.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.015
Once you take a life,

28:05.017 --> 28:06.417
it ruins your own;
it can't be undone.

28:06.419 --> 28:07.751
Just go, Haley,
just go!

28:07.753 --> 28:09.253
We can't do this.
Let's go.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.088
Yes, we can.
No, I can't.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.823
Okay, maybe you can't,
but I can.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.991
Okay?
PARKER:
Let her go.

28:13.993 --> 28:14.992
Let's go.

28:14.994 --> 28:15.859
Haley, just run.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.827
Come on, come on.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.328
Haley, go.
Run, Haley.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.997
Go to the
police, Haley.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.066
Just run, Haley!

28:33.012 --> 28:34.845
Haley!

28:34.847 --> 28:36.447
Run, Haley!

28:39.719 --> 28:40.784
No.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.753
Kevin, please
don't do this.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.921
PARKER:
Haley!

28:45.891 --> 28:46.490
Kevin!

28:46.492 --> 28:47.758
Okay.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.759
It's already done, okay?

28:48.761 --> 28:50.360
We got to get away from here.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.329
Take her.
Move!

28:52.331 --> 28:55.866
(grunting, panting)

29:13.886 --> 29:16.954
(tires screeching)

29:24.897 --> 29:26.063
Spike, check that van.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.335
Clear.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.937
I want everything
non-conductive--

29:33.939 --> 29:35.539
rubberized climbers,
Gorilla Bars, everything.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.007
Spike, floor plans?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.809
Nothing I could find.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.210
All right, we're gonna
eyeball this one.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.979
Let's fan out.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.381
Low profile.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.418
And talk to me.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.189
No. Please, you
can't do this.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.791
This is for you.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.225
Please, you can't
do this.
Swear to God,

29:55.227 --> 29:56.560
if you don't shut up...
No!

30:01.033 --> 30:02.933
Every window
on green wall's secure--

30:02.935 --> 30:05.169
bars and grates.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.470
Same on red.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.905
We're on black wall now.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.207
Same on white.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.909
The only way
we're getting in there is

30:11.911 --> 30:13.944
with a cutting torch.
No flames; too risky.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.212
Anybody else
have an entrance?

30:15.214 --> 30:17.147
And check for explosives.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.849
Possible entry on Black wall.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.585
Heavily fortified
though.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.920
We're testing now.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.092
Let me go!
You witch!

30:30.396 --> 30:31.895
Don't you touch her!

30:32.898 --> 30:35.232
This is your
problem, man.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.433
HALEY:
We have to go back.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.903
Oh, Haley,
just please trust me, okay?

30:39.905 --> 30:41.138
Trust me.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.508
(beeping)

30:44.510 --> 30:46.910
Guys, heavy nitrate residue
on this door.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.011
It's too risky.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.513
We need an entrance, people.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.248
Wordy, Leah,
can you make it happen?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.951
Not without making
a lot of noise.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.853
Come on, people,
we got to get in here.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.855
(locks clanking)

30:57.857 --> 30:59.389
Ed, we've got movement on white.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.424
All right.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.063
ED:
How many inside?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.931
It's not my fault!
I didn't want to do it!

31:07.933 --> 31:08.966
How many?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.200
Two. Plus the cop.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.070
Plus the cop.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.504
Keep him here.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.406
Sam, Wordy, Leah with me.
Turn around!

31:16.408 --> 31:19.176
Hands on the wall!

31:19.178 --> 31:21.078
Keep still!
Relax, man!

31:21.080 --> 31:22.179
(groans)

31:24.149 --> 31:26.049
Police! Get down!
Drop your weapon!

31:26.051 --> 31:27.050
(officers shouting)

31:27.052 --> 31:28.118
Police! Get down!

31:28.120 --> 31:29.419
Stay back!

31:29.421 --> 31:30.888
You have to help him, please!

31:30.890 --> 31:32.923
Stop. S-Stop.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.391
Where's Greg Parker?!

31:34.393 --> 31:36.126
He's dead!

31:37.463 --> 31:39.663
It's over.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.331
Okay, you're Kevin, right?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.233
Shh.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.502
Is that Haley with you?

31:45.504 --> 31:46.587
We're here to help, buddy.

31:46.588 --> 31:47.671
We just want to talk.
(muffled grunt)

31:49.008 --> 31:50.507
We don't need your help!

31:50.509 --> 31:52.109
Let's just calm
down here, Kevin.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.177
Let's just talk about this.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.548
(ticking, gas hissing)

32:02.221 --> 32:04.988
Do you want to make this more
complicated than it has to be?

32:04.990 --> 32:06.490
No, I don't.
Then tell us

32:06.491 --> 32:07.991
how to get our friend
out of there safely!

32:07.993 --> 32:09.993
We can't! It's gonna blow up
in, like, five minutes,

32:09.995 --> 32:11.178
and we have to get away!

32:11.179 --> 32:12.362
Guys, it's gonna detonate
in five minutes.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.931
You need to get out of there

32:13.933 --> 32:15.532
right now!

32:15.534 --> 32:17.367
Not going anywhere
without the boss.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.407
We need to know
where Greg is, Kevin.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.108
We can work everything else out,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.610
but we need to know
where Greg is.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.178
No. No.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.047
He doesn't get to be the hero.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.049
Not this time.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.016
ED:
Nobody's trying to be

32:33.018 --> 32:35.185
a hero here, Kevin.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.687
(quietly):
I need a 20 on the sarge.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.956
Nothing so far.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.628
Hold on.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.696
(distant banging)

32:45.698 --> 32:47.965
(table banging)

32:49.401 --> 32:52.069
(grunting)

32:53.305 --> 32:55.072
(ticking)

32:56.475 --> 32:58.976
Northeast corner.
We're on our way.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.978
Kevin, can you tell me
what this is about?

33:00.980 --> 33:04.081
Yeah, yeah, I can tell you
in five minutes.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.516
In five minutes,
I can tell you everything.

33:06.518 --> 33:07.751
Shh.
(Hayley grunting)

33:10.756 --> 33:12.122
He's stalling me.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.091
I need some answers here,
people, now.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.726
Look at me!
Look at me!

33:15.728 --> 33:18.061
What did he tell Haley?

33:18.063 --> 33:20.697
About her mom.
Something about her mom.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.499
Ed, it's something
about Haley's mom.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.205
Kevin...
this about Haley's mom?

33:28.207 --> 33:32.576
I don't wanna hear anymore lies,
okay? So stop talking!

33:32.578 --> 33:33.577
All right, we'll stop!

33:33.579 --> 33:35.045
Just tell us where Greg is

33:35.047 --> 33:37.147
and we'll stop
all of this, Kevin!

33:38.183 --> 33:40.083
(gas hissing)

33:40.085 --> 33:44.287
(banging on floor)

33:46.658 --> 33:48.358
We're chasing
echoes in here.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.160
We gotta keep going,
keep going.

33:50.162 --> 33:54.097
Kevin, I need
to know

33:54.099 --> 33:57.234
what you told Haley
about that night. Kevin?

33:57.236 --> 34:00.037
I told her the truth, okay?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.305
That, that he killed her mom!

34:02.307 --> 34:03.607
Who, who killed her mom?

34:03.609 --> 34:07.210
You know who kill... Greg did!

34:07.212 --> 34:09.246
Don't try to cover for him,
okay?

34:09.248 --> 34:12.115
Because I know what happened!

34:12.117 --> 34:14.217
He was the only one in the room!

34:15.254 --> 34:18.455
He didn't tell you?

34:18.457 --> 34:21.191
Okay, Kevin, you want the truth?

34:21.193 --> 34:24.261
Here it is.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.596
Haley's the one
who shot her mother.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.233
No, no, no, no,
that's not...

34:37.609 --> 34:40.544
(groans)

34:41.280 --> 34:43.146
(labored breathing)

34:46.585 --> 34:48.785
(ticking)

34:48.787 --> 34:51.388
ED:
Now I know, I know
you don't want

34:51.390 --> 34:53.690
to believe that.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.325
I did not shoot
my mother.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.562
Greg didn't tell you, Haley,
because you were a kid.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.098
You didn't mean to shoot
anybody, all right?

35:01.100 --> 35:03.700
He knew what that would do
to you, that's all.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.704
The poster in your room.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.473
Remember the poster?

35:13.679 --> 35:15.345
(door bangs open)

35:15.347 --> 35:17.614
MAN:
Police!

35:17.616 --> 35:20.317
WOMAN:
Get out of here!
Leave us alone!

35:20.319 --> 35:21.451
Get under the bed!

35:21.453 --> 35:24.521
Get under the bed!

35:24.523 --> 35:27.724
They're coming.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.127
(men shouting, banging sounds)

35:34.199 --> 35:36.633
Get it, baby.
Get the gun!

35:36.635 --> 35:39.202
(shouting continues)

35:40.839 --> 35:43.707
(loud bang)

35:43.709 --> 35:45.142
(sobbing)

35:50.916 --> 35:53.283
ED:
<i> That's how the cops found out.</i>

35:53.285 --> 35:55.318
<i> There was blood on the poster.</i>

35:56.355 --> 35:58.221
<i> That the shot could</i>
<i> only have come</i>

35:58.223 --> 36:00.857
<i> from inside the room,</i>
<i> from the floor.</i>

36:00.859 --> 36:02.926
<i> Now, that gun had a hair</i>
<i> trigger on it, Haley.</i>

36:02.928 --> 36:04.661
<i> It had a hair trigger.</i>

36:04.662 --> 36:06.395
<i> It could have happened</i>
<i> to anybody, anybody.</i>

36:06.398 --> 36:11.301
<i> Now, I know Greg like you do.</i>

36:11.303 --> 36:13.870
<i> And he must have had</i>
<i> a pretty good reason</i>

36:13.872 --> 36:16.506
<i> not to tell you this today.</i>

36:16.508 --> 36:18.175
I got you.

36:18.177 --> 36:21.878
ED:
<i> Now I want my friend to live.</i>

36:23.182 --> 36:25.715
And I'm betting
you do, too.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.819
I had the gun.

36:29.821 --> 36:34.524
It was in my hand.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.326
It was my fault.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.728
I remember.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.729
What?

36:39.731 --> 36:40.897
ED:
Get him, go, go, go.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.766
HALEY:
I remember.
It was me.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.602
Sam, get him
and get 'em out of here.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.270
Drop it!
Get him out of here.

36:47.272 --> 36:48.605
I didn't know.

36:48.607 --> 36:49.873
HALEY:
He's this way. Hurry!

36:49.875 --> 36:51.841
Hurry! He's this way!

36:51.843 --> 36:54.244
Leah, Wordy, we got a location.
Let's go. Let's move.

36:54.246 --> 36:58.248
I didn't know. Haley!

36:58.250 --> 36:59.950
I didn't know!

37:08.927 --> 37:10.260
Come on!

37:11.830 --> 37:13.914
What's in here,
Haley?

37:13.915 --> 37:15.999
Kevin set a timer, gas.
It's gonna explode.

37:16.001 --> 37:16.900
Get out of here now!

37:16.902 --> 37:19.903
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Go!

37:19.905 --> 37:20.904
Get the Gorilla Bar!

37:20.906 --> 37:22.305
We don't have time!

37:22.307 --> 37:23.974
We need it. It's non-conductive.
No sparks

37:23.976 --> 37:25.542
Only way to ram safely.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.944
Let's go!

37:27.946 --> 37:31.248
WORDY:
Sam, hurry!
North end of the building!

37:31.250 --> 37:32.882
(grunting)

37:32.884 --> 37:34.851
Let's get in there!

37:40.025 --> 37:40.957
Hurry, Sam!

37:42.995 --> 37:44.761
Greg, if you can hear me,

37:44.763 --> 37:47.631
we're gonna get you out
of there! Hang on.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.732
Swing the door!

37:48.734 --> 37:51.701
Let's move!
Move, move!
Now!

37:51.703 --> 37:52.769
(both grunt)

37:52.771 --> 37:55.038
Sarge!

37:57.442 --> 37:59.943
(mumbles)

37:59.945 --> 38:01.511
Leah, kill that timer!

38:01.513 --> 38:05.015
Okay, we got you, boss.
We got you. Let's get going.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.800
Come on. Let's go.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.584
Okay, you're covered.
Come on. We got ya.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.287
We got ya. We got ya.

38:10.289 --> 38:13.023
Come on!

38:13.025 --> 38:15.525
I got ya. Come on.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.726
(Parker coughing)

38:16.728 --> 38:17.861
PARKER:
Hayley! Get Hayley!

38:21.900 --> 38:23.633
(indistinct radio transmission)

38:31.443 --> 38:32.709
Come on!

38:41.053 --> 38:42.652
So you say to yourself,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.454
"I can handle this alone,
no problem.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.424
"I'm a smart guy,
I'm Sergeant Greg Parker

38:47.426 --> 38:50.927
of the SRU."
Keep it on. Breathe.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.530
You think, "I can just talk
my way out of this.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.865
"I can, I can talk bullets
right back up the barrel

38:55.867 --> 38:56.866
"'cause that's the kind

38:56.868 --> 38:59.469
of frickin' genius I am."

38:59.471 --> 39:00.870
Jules...

39:00.872 --> 39:02.972
You could have died.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.742
Died.

39:07.612 --> 39:10.413
And all because,
because you want

39:10.415 --> 39:12.082
to protect this girl
from something

39:12.084 --> 39:15.018
you didn't think
she should know? What?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.686
No, it would have happened
anyway.

39:16.688 --> 39:20.890
Jules, he, the kid was going
to kill me anyway.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.693
You don't know that.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.595
(sighs)

39:28.100 --> 39:30.567
You've got no right
going around

39:30.569 --> 39:31.901
giving up your own life

39:31.903 --> 39:34.537
trying to save everybody else's.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.840
Not if you don't have to.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.714
(voice breaking):
She's not the only one
who needs you.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.087
¶ ¶

39:51.089 --> 39:54.958
¶ What happens now ¶

39:54.960 --> 40:00.830
¶ If the world is upside down? ¶

40:04.035 --> 40:08.171
¶ Do we fall through the sky? ¶

40:08.173 --> 40:14.811
¶ Or will we hit the ground? ¶

40:16.815 --> 40:20.183
¶ When are you going up? ¶

40:20.185 --> 40:23.186
¶ When are you coming down? ¶

40:23.188 --> 40:29.192
¶ Where are you gonna go? ¶

40:29.194 --> 40:32.962
¶ Either way, it's gonna hurt ¶

40:32.964 --> 40:36.199
¶ The clouds or the dirt ¶

40:36.201 --> 40:41.471
¶ I thought I'd let you know ¶

40:41.473 --> 40:45.708
¶ When are you going up? ¶

40:45.710 --> 40:49.212
¶ When are you coming down? ¶

40:49.214 --> 40:53.550
¶ Where are you gonna go? ¶

40:55.454 --> 40:58.588
¶ Either way, it's gonna hurt ¶

40:58.590 --> 41:02.058
¶ The clouds or the dirt ¶

41:02.060 --> 41:06.162
¶ I thought I'd let you know. ¶
