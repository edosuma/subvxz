00:01.469 --> 00:03.701
(theme music)

00:50.918 --> 00:52.951
(indistinct chatter)

00:54.621 --> 00:57.255
(panting)

00:58.959 --> 01:00.425
- Watch yourself!

01:00.494 --> 01:02.494
- Oh, dear.
Are you all right?

01:02.530 --> 01:04.429
- Where are you going?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.633
(panting)

01:07.635 --> 01:10.034
- Mind where you're walking!

01:10.838 --> 01:13.037
- Oh! - Did you see that? - Yes!

01:13.074 --> 01:14.573
- Watch it here!

01:14.642 --> 01:16.708
- You all right?
- Oh, excuse me.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.710
(dramatic music)

01:24.952 --> 01:26.752
(muffled panting)

01:29.590 --> 01:32.057
(eerie muffled soundscape)

01:36.697 --> 01:38.564
- What do you want?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.666
- What have you done to me?
I didn't do anything.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.068
- You liar!
You did this to me!

01:43.203 --> 01:44.202
(woman groaning)

01:44.271 --> 01:45.803
(man): Let go of her!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.406
(panting and coughing)

01:48.442 --> 01:49.607
- Are you all right?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.476
- Bloody hell, man!
What do you think you're doing?

01:51.479 --> 01:53.378
(panting)

01:53.447 --> 01:55.347
- I have to go.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.315
There's no more time.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.285
- Dear god, he's getting worse.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.826
(baby babbling)

02:10.698 --> 02:12.364
You ready for today?

02:12.366 --> 02:14.566
- I am, indeed.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.502
This is a rare treat.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.171
- A gift from mrs. Hart.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.073
And one deserving of the day.

02:21.075 --> 02:22.974
Frank rhodes is finally
going to trial.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.176
- Yes.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.578
And I'm the one who gets
to put him away.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.080
- Not just you.
There's an eyewitness.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.850
- Yes, but I'll be delivering
the coup de grÃ¢ce.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.987
They're still warm!

02:36.056 --> 02:38.991
- William, every Monday
morning you buy those scones

02:38.993 --> 02:40.658
And every Monday morning
I refuse them.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.327
You know I loathe those things.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.562
- It's her loss.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.065
Well.
(clears throat)

02:48.669 --> 02:50.969
We will celebrate tonight.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.405
- You don't usually relish
in an execution.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.207
- This time I'm willing
to make an exception.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.645
- Right.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.751
Let's continue:
Politics in canada.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.489
- Ah, murdoch!

03:10.491 --> 03:11.957
I'm off to the court in an hour.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.693
I'm just going through
the final details with mr. Bent.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.161
- Hello, nigel bent.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.096
- Detective.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.766
- You're worried.
- No.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.334
(clattering)
ah!

03:23.370 --> 03:25.904
(groaning)
- you all right?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.439
- Perhaps a bit jittery.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.574
It's not every day you have
to face frank rhodes.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.245
- All you have to do is tell
the truth about what you saw.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.779
- And that was?

03:34.848 --> 03:38.850
- I saw frank rhodes
choke the life
out of wallace franklin,

03:38.919 --> 03:40.518
The prison guard.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.587
- And I will support
your testimony.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.057
I will give an account
of my associations
with frank rhodes.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.393
I will tell of his misdeeds;

03:48.528 --> 03:50.928
His kidnapping of my wife,
my daughter,

03:50.965 --> 03:53.831
And together we will ensure
that he...
- No!

03:54.702 --> 03:56.601
Get away!
Le-le-le-leave me alone.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.604
- What is it, mr. Bent?
- No, no, no!

03:58.739 --> 04:00.338
G-get away from me!

04:00.474 --> 04:02.073
- Mr. Bent, please!

04:02.142 --> 04:04.375
(choking)

04:09.683 --> 04:11.683
(deep exhale)

04:14.855 --> 04:16.888
(dramatic music)

04:18.592 --> 04:19.891
- Bloody hell.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.893
What just happened, murdoch?

04:21.895 --> 04:23.495
- I have no idea.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.033
Delayed?
- Just 24 hours.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.834
- They allowed rhodes
that liberty?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.303
- I requested it.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.837
- You? Why?

04:32.873 --> 04:35.574
- Because my key witness
is now in the morgue.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.977
Mr. Bent's testimony was
the linchpin in our case
against frank rhodes.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.114
Now we need time to strategize

04:42.249 --> 04:44.182
Now that the late mr. Bent
is no longer part of it.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.184
- You have murdoch.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.853
- Yes, and his testimony
might be enough,

04:48.889 --> 04:51.656
But I would rather do
due diligence
to ensure conviction.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.392
Would you not agree?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.596
- The man threatened
my wife and child.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.465
Do what you have to
to secure a conviction.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.934
One more day shouldn't make
a difference.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.736
- Gentlemen.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.075
(indistinct chatter)

05:10.077 --> 05:12.944
- Anything I say now
would be speculation.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.880
- Well, then speculate.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.816
- From outward appearance
he appears to be in good health.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.351
- He's dead.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.885
So I'd say, in this case,

05:20.921 --> 05:23.154
Outward appearances
are most certainly deceiving.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.424
- I understand that
and I will be performing
a thorough examination

05:26.493 --> 05:28.427
Once you gentlemen
leave me in peace.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.895
- Blood tests?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.630
- I collected samples.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.899
We'll try to figure out
what caused such a seizure.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.200
How was he acting
before he died?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.770
- Agitated.

05:38.905 --> 05:42.374
I also believe he was
experiencing hallucinations.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.841
- I see.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.043
- And how long had that
been going on for?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.548
- He had been acting funny.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.185
- Funny how?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.855
- He lost his balance
a few times,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.957
Started saying
he was seeing things.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.262
- Was your husband
a drinking man?

06:04.331 --> 06:06.465
- My husband was teetotal,

06:06.467 --> 06:09.267
Believed drink to be
the devil's brew.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.673
- When did these symptoms
begin occurring?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.741
- Just yesterday morning.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.044
At first he thought
it was nothing.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.613
- So just recently then?

06:23.683 --> 06:25.883
- Just over 24 hours ago.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.288
I told him to say nothing
about this

06:30.357 --> 06:34.359
And you people forced him to.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.562
- We asked him to do his duty.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.932
- And see where that got him.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.537
(crying)

07:00.720 --> 07:04.922
- We have to entertain
the possibility that
someone did mr. Bent harm.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.125
- Oh, I'm already
of that opinion.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.194
- Well, at least it couldn't
have been rhodes.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.129
- Sir, I wouldn't necessarily
think that.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.132
We have to consider
frank rhodes.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.802
His reach extends
far beyond his prison cell.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.736
- Here you are, sir.
- What have you got there?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.473
- Uh, names and addresses
of rhodes'
most recent associates.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.107
Uh, only a couple in toronto.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.678
- We have to consider rhodes,
sir, behind bars or not.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.146
- Bring them in.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.715
- Ah, we've only found one
so far, sir.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.517
Anderson and mcnabb
are looking for the others.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.486
- Learning to delegate,
are you, higgins?

07:34.488 --> 07:35.854
- Just laziness, sir.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.421
- Hm.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.090
(clears throat)

07:39.159 --> 07:41.560
- Here you are, sir.
Ah!

07:41.562 --> 07:43.861
Sorry, sir.
Butterfingers.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.566
(sighs)

07:54.908 --> 07:56.374
- Trial is delayed?

07:56.510 --> 07:59.644
- Just until tomorrow.
Or the next day at the latest.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.446
- How did the man die?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.649
- I'm hoping mrs. Hart
can provide those answers.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.484
- And what do you think?

08:07.587 --> 08:10.054
- He may have ingested
a foreign substance.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.591
- Poisoning?
- Perhaps.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.796
- Well, it's a good thing we
still have you to put him away.

08:17.931 --> 08:21.465
- It's reassuring to know
I'm not the only one
interested in vengeance.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.469
- He threatened susannah,
william.

08:24.604 --> 08:28.406
That alone has exhausted
my capacity for mercy.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.613
(man sighs)
- nigel bent.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.082
Can't say I met the fella.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.750
Who is he?

08:38.752 --> 08:40.619
- Currently,
a possible murder victim.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.921
- Mm. Well, I don't know
anything about tha'.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.425
And why would I have an issue
with someone
I don't even know?

08:48.295 --> 08:49.493
- Money?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.696
Revenge?
Fear?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.631
Which one of those?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.767
- Uh, could be any one,
I suppose.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.103
If I knew the man.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.372
- But you do know frank rhodes.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.173
- Frank rhodes...

09:03.210 --> 09:05.576
Frank rhodes. No.
- Don't act stupid!

09:05.612 --> 09:08.079
You two were arrested together
years ago.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.982
- Ah, him!
(chuckles)

09:11.051 --> 09:13.451
I haven't talked to frank
in years.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.387
Not since he went screwy.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.188
- What does that mean?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.091
- Ain't been the same
since the black hand
turned her back on him.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.862
And, let me tell you,
if frank's on the bad side
of the black hand,

09:24.864 --> 09:27.465
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.334
Dead man walking.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.471
- So you had nothing to do
with nigel bent?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.607
- Already said as much.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.208
- Right.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.145
- You all right?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.713
- Yes, fine.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.820
- There's a good chance
that frank rhodes could walk
away from this,

09:48.889 --> 09:50.488
Seeing that we have lost
our eyewitness.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.890
- I'll get him.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.426
I have more than enough
information on the many crimes

09:54.561 --> 09:56.628
That make up frank rhodes' life.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.897
- None as good as nigel bent.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.165
- But enough.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.834
I'll see to it he ends up
where he belongs.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.504
Julia?
What are you doing here?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.239
- I called her.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.575
- Why?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.044
- You dropped a file.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.647
You almost fell to the ground
in the interview room.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.316
I thought the good doctor
should take a look at you.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.251
- That's ridiculous.
I'm fine!

10:20.287 --> 10:22.120
- William, it will only
take a moment.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.788
- I don't have a moment.

10:23.923 --> 10:28.059
I need to find all of the files
on frank rhodes' crimes
and misdemeanors.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.463
- Well, you can lead
a horse to water.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.932
(sighs)
- keep an eye on him.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.068
If you notice anything else,
let me know.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.537
Men and doctors.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.342
Any progress?

10:45.379 --> 10:46.611
- None.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.947
No traces of any known agents
so far.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.216
- So an unknown compound?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.618
- Or one that's yet
to be identified.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.687
Must be lethal if the man's wife
is to be believed.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.891
From first symptom to death
in just over 24 hours.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.226
- So you have reason
to not believe her?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.627
- Excuse me?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.697
- Well, so you think
she's lying?

11:06.766 --> 11:09.100
- Uh, it was just
a figure of speech.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.768
I apologize.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.238
- Uh, no, I'm...
I didn't mean to be short.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.306
I...
(sighs)

11:15.375 --> 11:18.676
There's just something
about this that's making me feel
uneasy.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.780
William may be
experiencing symptoms.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.517
- I see.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.919
Well, we should get
to the bottom of it then.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.021
- Yes.
How can I help?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.744
(tinnitus)

11:56.783 --> 11:59.016
(eerie piano music)

12:01.421 --> 12:03.421
<i> (man): You're not going</i>
<i> to get me.</i>

12:05.525 --> 12:07.425
<i> I'm invincible.</i>

12:15.302 --> 12:16.901
- No, you're not.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.638
I'm going to see you hang.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.476
(voice echoing):
You'll be well dead
before that happens.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.912
- No, I won't.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.249
You're going to pay, rhodes.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.985
- Not as much as you will.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.854
- What have you done to me?!
(rhodes laughs)

12:39.626 --> 12:40.991
What have you...

12:41.027 --> 12:42.927
Mmmph.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.395
(groaning)

12:44.431 --> 12:46.798
- Sir!
- What is it, higgins?

12:46.867 --> 12:49.066
- Uh, look at the detective.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.168
(murdoch groaning,
glass breaking)

12:55.875 --> 12:58.610
- Fetch dr. Ogden.
- Sir.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.613
- It's nothing.
- That's what you said
last time.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.948
- I saw you.
You were talking to the fairies.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.217
- Your temperature is very high!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.419
And your heart rate is elevated.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.354
How long have you been
feeling this way?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.223
- I'm not feeling like anything.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.592
- William, will you stop
lying to me?!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.695
This could be
a very serious situation.

13:17.731 --> 13:20.231
- And if it is,
I know the source of it.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.066
- Stand down, murdoch.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.968
- You can try and stop me.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.105
- I have to go to the morgue.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.208
I have to find out
what's happening to him.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.446
- Sir.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.716
Is detective murdoch all right?
- He's fine.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.651
- Didn't look fine to me.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.121
- If I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.190
Now get me a list of all frank
rhodes' recent associates.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.260
- I already did, sir.
- Well, find more!

13:50.497 --> 13:52.130
Henry...

13:52.265 --> 13:54.866
Today's not the day
for laziness.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.835
Murdoch just might be
in real trouble here.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.574
(horn tooting)

14:05.078 --> 14:06.911
- Watch where you're going!

14:09.683 --> 14:11.416
(woman): Are you all right?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.183
- Did you see that?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.820
What do you think you're doing?

14:19.860 --> 14:22.360
What is happening to me?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.662
(moaning)

14:38.111 --> 14:40.712
- We've almost exhausted
all of the natural toxins.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.648
- So man-made?
- Good possibility.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.650
(sighs)

14:45.719 --> 14:47.518
Don't worry. We will get
to the bottom of this.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.186
- Well, undoubtedly.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.588
But what is in doubt is
whether we find out
what killed this man

14:51.625 --> 14:53.591
Soon enough to help william.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.593
(sighs)

15:00.934 --> 15:02.666
(metal door rattling)

15:06.139 --> 15:08.405
(man): Hey! Look who's here!

15:11.478 --> 15:14.211
(man): You're the one who put me
in here, damn you!

15:14.281 --> 15:16.513
(indistinct shouting)

15:20.487 --> 15:21.853
(man): Don't leave me here!

15:21.855 --> 15:23.587
- We meet again.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.891
- Mr. Rhodes.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.826
- Come to say goodbye?

15:31.231 --> 15:34.064
Well, perhaps that won't happen.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.467
I, uh...

15:36.469 --> 15:39.370
I heard your key witness
has met

15:39.505 --> 15:42.173
With unfortunate circumstances.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.642
- You heard about that, did you?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.810
- Things like that get around.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.515
I must say you're looking
a little worse for wear.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.884
Little one keeping you up?

15:55.188 --> 15:58.288
Never a good idea to have
a child at your advanced age.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.060
- Nothing.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.929
- Well, it's certainly
not nothing.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.798
Something killed mr. Bent!

16:06.933 --> 16:09.967
- Perhaps it was a stroke,
or a brain hemorrhage?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.471
- I think it's time
to get the saw.

16:22.615 --> 16:27.284
- Well, I certainly have
no insight into
what is troubling you.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.588
But I do hope it passes.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.826
By any chance,
are you a travelling man?

16:37.196 --> 16:39.363
- What does that have to do
with anything?

16:39.432 --> 16:42.466
- Ah, this modern world.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.038
People travelling
hither and yon.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.043
Pick up all sorts
of nasty ailments.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.179
- This is more than just
a nasty ailment.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.847
- That's too bad.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.052
- What did you do to me, rhodes?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.923
- I really must
haunt your dreams.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.460
- Hardly.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.262
- What could I possibly do?

17:11.397 --> 17:15.899
I've been in here six months
with nothing but
my conscience for a companion.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.536
- Your conscience?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.805
- I do have one, you know.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.977
- If it wasn't you...

17:28.147 --> 17:29.614
It was one of your friends.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.215
- I got no friends.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.552
Not one single visitor
since I've been in here.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.887
(scoffs)

17:38.024 --> 17:39.891
Tell you, now that
I'm facing the end,

17:40.026 --> 17:44.228
It has really made me consider
some of the decisions
I've made in my life.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.363
- I don't care
about your decisions, rhodes!

17:46.399 --> 17:47.898
What did you do to me?!

17:47.967 --> 17:49.367
- And I told you:

17:50.437 --> 17:52.903
I've done nothing.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
As I said, look where I am.

17:57.643 --> 18:01.245
And this is the only place
I've been for months.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.351
Perhaps what is affecting
your body is also
affecting your judgement?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.052
- There's nothing wrong
with my judgement.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.521
- That so?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.991
Well, then, perhaps
it was something you ate.
Nah, you know,

18:13.993 --> 18:17.861
Sometimes we try something
unfamiliar and the body acts up.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.065
<i> - You ready for today?</i>

18:21.067 --> 18:22.833
<i> - I am, indeed.</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:26.137
<i> This is a rare treat.</i>

18:26.206 --> 18:28.172
<i> - A gift from mrs. Hart.</i>

18:30.810 --> 18:32.810
- I touch a nerve?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.679
- If you harmed my wife...

18:35.748 --> 18:37.414
- As I said,

18:37.416 --> 18:39.317
I have harmed nobody.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.691
- I'm going to watch you hang.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.895
- Such parting words.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.299
(sighs)
nice talking to you.

18:56.569 --> 19:00.104
You don't know how much
I appreciate having a visitor.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.774
- I'll see you in court.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.243
- Sure.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.447
God willing.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.051
(epic music)

19:20.193 --> 19:21.993
(panting)

19:32.438 --> 19:34.905
- You don't have long, do you?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.810
- Who are you?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.280
- Must be strange for you
now that the shoe is
on the other foot.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.750
- What are you talking about?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.953
- You sent so many
to their grave.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.423
- All deserving.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.426
- In your eyes.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.963
- I'm not sure
they see it that way.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.899
But I suppose
you'll find out soon enough.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.369
- Who are you?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.839
- I speak for those
who want you dead.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.441
- Wait!

20:10.510 --> 20:12.643
I asked you a question.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.079
- Excuse me, sir?

20:16.115 --> 20:18.983
- You were speaking to me.
- I were not.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.319
I never said a word.
- I heard you!

20:21.321 --> 20:24.054
I didn't say a thing.
Please, sir, let me go.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.890
- I'm sorry.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.070
- There appears to be no damage
to the cerebellum.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.138
- But his motor skills
were affected.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.540
- So we can rule that out
as the cause.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.612
- And there's no damage
to the medial frontal cortex.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.281
- So not the reason
for the delusions.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.550
(scoffs)
- well, it seems mr. Bent is

20:52.685 --> 20:54.485
The owner of a perfectly
healthy brain.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.289
- Well, something killed him.
We just don't know what it was.
(julia sighs)

20:58.424 --> 21:01.124
- I'm sorry to say
that appears to be the case.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.295
- Where are you going?
- I have to find william.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.966
If we can find nothing of the
agent that killed mr. Bent,

21:08.968 --> 21:11.535
Then perhaps william is
my better bet.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.705
I have to examine him.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.840
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.779
(sighs)

21:21.781 --> 21:23.381
(clears throat)

21:28.854 --> 21:30.854
(crying)

21:41.968 --> 21:43.667
- Those two there.

21:43.736 --> 21:47.270
I know at one time
rhodes was associated
with the woman, betsy warren.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.740
She used to be his sweetheart.
- Who's the big fella?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.342
- I don't know.
- Hm.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.411
Ah, sir, do you need me?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.612
- Just keep beating the bushes,
higgins.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.615
Oh, and get mcnabb and anderson
to check out mr. Bent's past.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.485
There's a chance that murdoch's
barking up the wrong tree
on this one.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.354
- You think that possible, sir?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.622
- Just do what you're told,
higgins.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.001
Mind if I join you?

22:20.306 --> 22:21.739
- Did we say yes?

22:21.808 --> 22:24.442
- What would it matter
if you did or you didn't?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.043
- What do you want?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.044
- A couple of answers
about frank rhodes.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.781
- Don't know
who you're talking about.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.383
(chuckles)

22:33.753 --> 22:35.585
You were his piece of fluff
once upon a time, weren't you?

22:36.756 --> 22:38.589
- And what business
is that of yours?

22:38.724 --> 22:40.557
- I'm the one asking
the questions.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.662
- I knew frank for a time, yes.
- And?

22:44.664 --> 22:47.330
- Let's just say I'm happy
to know he's behind bars.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.001
- She's with me now.
- Ah! Lucky fella.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.236
- Watch it.
- Or what?

22:54.374 --> 22:55.806
I'll tell you what.

22:55.941 --> 22:59.143
Why don't you step outside
for five minutes
and play with the traffic?

22:59.145 --> 23:01.478
I need a private word
with the lady.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.052
- It's all right, callum.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.827
(she sighs.)

23:18.197 --> 23:19.964
So what do you want to know
about frank?

23:20.099 --> 23:21.966
- Do you ever visit him in jail?

23:22.101 --> 23:24.635
- Of course not.
Haven't seen frank in years.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.904
Although I am looking forward
to his trial.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.972
I hope he hangs.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.975
- A woman scorned.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.644
- More like a woman
who dodged a bullet.

23:33.646 --> 23:37.047
I know what happens to people
who get on frank's bad side.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.583
- So you don't do
his bidding anymore?

23:39.718 --> 23:41.585
(sighs)
- certainly not.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.386
- How did you meet frank?

23:43.423 --> 23:47.057
- Years ago. He did a job
for a man I worked for.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.993
- And this man...
Do you have a name?

23:48.995 --> 23:51.595
- Benedict evers.
He's a chemist.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.465
Ran an apothecary
near church street.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.267
I did his books.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.670
- And what kind of job
did frank do for him?

23:59.805 --> 24:02.873
- I learned well enough
never to ask frank
what he was up to.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.742
But I will tell you,

24:05.812 --> 24:09.079
When I first started
working for mr. Evers,
he was a married man.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.415
And when I finished,
he was a widower.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.484
And none too bothered
about that.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.625
(indistinct chatter)

24:22.628 --> 24:25.763
(william panting)

24:31.504 --> 24:33.770
- Ooh!
Ooh.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.139
(voices echoing)

24:39.846 --> 24:42.512
(distorted soundscape)

24:48.454 --> 24:50.186
- What do you want?

24:50.223 --> 24:51.655
- What have you done to me?

24:51.691 --> 24:52.790
- I didn't do anything.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.592
- You liar!
You did this to me!

24:55.661 --> 24:58.595
- What're you doing?
- Let go of her!

24:58.731 --> 25:00.764
(coughing)

25:00.800 --> 25:03.667
- Are you all right?
- Bloody hell, man!
What do you think you're doing?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.004
- I have to go.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.039
There's no more time.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.275
- Dear god, he's getting worse.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.483
Are you sure you're all right?

25:19.618 --> 25:22.819
- I'm fine. He thinks I had
something to do with this.

25:22.821 --> 25:25.221
William isn't in
his right mind at the moment.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.024
- What did I do?

25:27.159 --> 25:30.160
- I believe he thinks
you poisoned his orange juice.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.163
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.500
- Don't insult me, inspector.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.569
The detective has long suspected
me of crimes I did not commit.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.839
This appears to be the latest.
- Where did you purchase it?

25:44.176 --> 25:46.843
- Arthur has an exotic fruit
supplier and I acquired some.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.846
It was meant to be a gift,
not a murder weapon.

25:49.848 --> 25:53.250
- I'll send a constable
to retrieve what's left of
the orange juice from your home.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.186
- That is ridiculous.
I had nothing to do with this.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.188
- I didn't say that.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.323
It may have been tampered with
without your knowledge.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.526
- Actually, it couldn't
have been the orange juice.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.862
I likely drank more of it
than william did.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.797
- Apologies, mrs. Hart.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.937
- I may have something.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.405
What is it?

26:15.474 --> 26:18.409
- Rhodes was friendly
with a woman who used
to work for a chemist.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.344
- Does this chemist have a name?
- Benedict evers.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.147
Now if the woman I talked
to is to be believed,

26:24.216 --> 26:26.417
He hired frank rhodes
to kill his wife.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.552
- I see. So he could be
involved somehow?

26:28.687 --> 26:31.888
- Hm. I'll do my best
to find this mr. Evers.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.800
(dramatic music)

26:51.910 --> 26:55.179
(panting, clock dinging)

27:02.521 --> 27:04.788
(dramatic music)
(panting)

27:06.425 --> 27:08.491
(loud ring)

27:20.740 --> 27:22.939
(passerby laughing)

27:27.079 --> 27:28.945
(laughter)

27:28.947 --> 27:31.514
- Hello, I need you
to connect me to a number!

27:34.654 --> 27:37.020
(jazz music)

27:47.232 --> 27:50.500
- Detective,
you don't look well.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.368
- I need to talk to you.

27:52.405 --> 27:54.371
- That's why I'm here.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.106
Beat it.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.984
So what is so important
that you called me?

28:08.154 --> 28:10.653
- What can you tell me
about frank rhodes?

28:10.690 --> 28:13.523
- I know he betrayed
the black hand.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.959
So as far as we're concerned,
he's dead to us.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.728
- He will be soon enough.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.063
- We would have been happy
to have done that for you.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.868
- How many people
has he killed for you?

28:25.538 --> 28:27.103
- Detective.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.542
- Has he ever used poison?

28:32.578 --> 28:33.877
- I wouldn't know.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.412
But poison?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.081
That don't seem like
frank's style. No, too clean.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.553
Wait a minute: You telling me
that's what's happening to you?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.890
Jesus. Poor sap.
- I didn't say that.

28:47.025 --> 28:49.392
- You don't have to.
I can see it in your eyes.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.632
If rhodes did this,

28:55.634 --> 28:57.634
He would have needed help.

28:58.804 --> 29:01.038
- Nah. I told you, detective,

29:01.173 --> 29:04.241
No one in our organization
has anything to do
with rhodes anymore.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.576
And we have no disagreement
with you.

29:06.645 --> 29:09.179
- Then, please,
if you know anything,

29:09.248 --> 29:11.848
Who on the outside
could be helping him?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.920
-You said it...
You think it was poison?

29:18.057 --> 29:19.623
There is one man.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.464
(jazz music stops)

29:35.207 --> 29:37.507
- What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.210
- I need to talk to the owner.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.679
- He hasn't been here in weeks.
I think he shut the place down.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.215
- And he's left
all his worldly goods there?

29:45.217 --> 29:46.349
- Appears so.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.818
Bright boy.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.886
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.223
- Get yourself down here
right now!

30:07.239 --> 30:08.639
- So...

30:09.775 --> 30:11.975
What else do you want?
- Where's evers now?

30:12.044 --> 30:13.943
- How would I know?

30:13.979 --> 30:17.447
- Well, you know when he cleared
out, so it stands to reason
that you know where he went.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.652
- I didn't care to be close
to him.

30:21.654 --> 30:22.986
- Why not?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.855
- He became a bit of a nutter
after his wife died.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.658
- What does that mean?
- Just wasn't the same man.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.861
I'd see him out carousing...
Store hardly ever open.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.729
- He lost his wife.
- Yeah.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.200
I suppose, but there was
a cloud over him.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.402
- Oh, uh...

30:40.039 --> 30:42.139
...You ever seen this fellow
around here?

30:42.141 --> 30:44.541
- Matter of fact I have,
once or twice.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.276
- Did he do business with evers?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.745
- I don't know
what he did with evers,
but I did see him around.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.215
Is that one of your men?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.716
- Hm. Look, I'm done
with you for now.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.620
What the devil are you doing
here, murdoch?

30:56.689 --> 31:00.490
- Sir, the owner of this
establishment is an
associate of frank rhodes.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.359
- That may be,
but he's long gone.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.693
- Right.
I have to get--

31:03.762 --> 31:06.096
- You need you go home, murdoch.
That's an order!

31:07.333 --> 31:09.233
Come on. Let me point you
in the right direction.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.800
It's on my way.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.177
- William?

31:21.780 --> 31:23.313
William?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.519
(baby crying)

31:38.497 --> 31:40.196
- I just wanted some time
with her.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.932
- William.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.134
- Oh, just a few more moments.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.739
Julia, I want you to know...

31:51.043 --> 31:53.476
...That no matter what happens,

31:54.880 --> 31:57.281
I'll die a happy man.

31:57.416 --> 32:02.218
- Well, I have no intention
of living as an unhappy woman,
so you stay here.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.154
- Oh, please.
Stay with me?

32:04.156 --> 32:05.422
- No.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.358
I'm going to do what I can
to keep you alive.

32:11.563 --> 32:12.996
- You...

32:14.166 --> 32:18.167
Are going to grow up
to be strong

32:18.203 --> 32:21.337
And brilliant,
just like your mother.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.945
- Oi!

32:29.949 --> 32:31.581
After him, boys!

32:33.852 --> 32:35.385
(all panting)

32:36.522 --> 32:38.121
(groaning)

32:41.193 --> 32:42.526
- You're too late.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.194
Your detective's already
a dead man.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.405
- Please stop.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.941
- I'll stop
when I get an answer.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.675
(groaning)

32:59.712 --> 33:01.912
- Doctor, perhaps you sho...
- I'm fine.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.614
Let the inspector do
what he needs to do.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.850
(shouting in pain)

33:09.955 --> 33:12.288
(groaning)

33:22.434 --> 33:24.100
(baby babbling)

33:30.576 --> 33:32.842
(tinnitus)

33:35.614 --> 33:37.514
(groaning)

33:37.516 --> 33:39.983
<i> (woman): It won't be long now,</i>
<i> william.</i>

33:39.985 --> 33:41.717
<i> Are you ready?</i>

33:42.921 --> 33:44.321
- No.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.823
<i> - No one ever is.</i>

33:46.892 --> 33:49.192
<i> But death waits for no one.</i>

33:49.327 --> 33:51.261
(baby crying)

33:54.166 --> 33:55.832
- Come. Come on.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.333
(man groaning)

34:02.741 --> 34:04.274
- What did he say?

34:04.343 --> 34:06.676
- He worked at a bakery.
He poisoned murdoch's scone.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.612
- With what?
- He doesn't know.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.614
- And who ordered him
to do that?

34:10.749 --> 34:12.682
- Rhodes.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.486
- Doctor ogden?

34:16.621 --> 34:19.622
- See if you can find out
what this is contaminated with
and, please, hurry.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.491
- I'll do my best.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.694
- You'll do better than that,
mrs. Hart. You'll find out
what's in there.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.298
My husband's life lies
in the balance.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.300
- What are you doing?

34:30.435 --> 34:34.170
- Hopefully persuading someone
to tell the truth.

34:35.441 --> 34:38.508
- The man you are looking
for is benedict evers, who,

34:38.643 --> 34:41.444
Until recently, operated
a pharmacy on church street.

34:41.513 --> 34:45.048
He's familiar with this man
who worked in a bakery
on queen street.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.718
I also need you to find
this man and find him quickly.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.188
Do whatever it takes
to make this happen.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.788
Understood?

34:52.825 --> 34:54.390
Thank you, gentlemen.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.533
- Mm-hm.
- Oh!

35:03.535 --> 35:07.737
Oh, look who just came in!
- Ah!
- Hey, gorgeous!

35:07.739 --> 35:10.407
Come here!
- Oh, come closer, love.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.209
Come closer!

35:13.945 --> 35:16.680
- You're gorgeous!
- Yeah.
(inmates whistling)

35:17.816 --> 35:20.617
Oh, oh!
Where you going, sweetheart?

35:30.796 --> 35:34.497
- Ah, the good doctor.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.701
I've been expecting your visit.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.702
- I'm sure you have.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.672
- So, now that you're here...

35:45.310 --> 35:47.310
What can I do for you?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.812
- I don't want my husband
to die.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.783
- Well, then you are not like
most wives I've met.

35:53.852 --> 35:57.520
But I-I'm not sure that
I can help you with that.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.591
- Mr. Rhodes, I'm desperate.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.627
- How desperate?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.464
- I'll do whatever you want.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.233
What did you give him?

36:14.139 --> 36:15.605
- Nothing.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.341
Look at me.
Look at where I am. Hm?

36:19.444 --> 36:22.778
Please, mr. Rhodes,
I don't want him to die.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.815
(cackling)

36:26.885 --> 36:29.151
- We, uh, we all die, doctor.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.354
You should know that
better than most.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.089
Is it not true?

36:34.293 --> 36:37.894
Death has surrounded you
most of your life.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.629
- What do you want?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.164
- Out.

36:44.102 --> 36:47.637
Like your husband,
I don't believe
I'm ready for the end.

36:49.141 --> 36:51.041
- What did you give him?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.911
- Does that matter?
- Of course it does!

36:58.250 --> 37:02.185
- What if I were to tell you

37:02.320 --> 37:04.721
I have the cure?

37:06.258 --> 37:08.090
- What do you want for it?

37:10.062 --> 37:11.661
- Freedom.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.265
- I can give you that.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.700
- Ah!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.637
What have you done?

37:22.975 --> 37:25.875
- You have less than
half an hour. But this?

37:25.944 --> 37:28.010
This will save you.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.816
- Oh, you wouldn't
commit a murder.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.385
- To save my husband,
I would do anything.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.292
- I'm not sure, sir.
We're still looking.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.961
- I know.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.834
- What else can we do?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.537
- I don't know.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.577
- You're a doctor.
You wouldn't let me die.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.379
Isn't there some kind of oath?

38:03.415 --> 38:05.115
- I'll make an exception.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.983
(chuckles)

38:08.153 --> 38:10.253
- You don't have it in you.

38:12.657 --> 38:15.558
- I am a wife and a mother.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.194
And let me tell you, mr. Rhodes,

38:18.263 --> 38:20.663
You wouldn't be the first man
I killed.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.399
- I'm not sure that
I believe you on that.

38:26.471 --> 38:30.340
- Mr. Rhodes, tell me,
are you starting to feel
constriction in your chest?

38:30.342 --> 38:32.809
You should be about now.
(he groans.)

38:35.213 --> 38:36.279
- Guard!

38:36.414 --> 38:37.781
Guard!

38:39.084 --> 38:41.684
- There is no one here
but you and me.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.287
Understand me, mr. Rhodes:

38:44.422 --> 38:48.624
If you face a judge,
there's a chance you could
escape with your life.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.695
But that is not an option
you have with me.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.899
(panting)

38:59.671 --> 39:00.970
Ah...

39:03.608 --> 39:05.375
I can...

39:05.510 --> 39:07.710
I could give you an address

39:07.746 --> 39:10.180
For the man
who supplied the poison.

39:10.182 --> 39:13.149
- I'm to believe
there's an antidote?
- There is.

39:14.086 --> 39:17.052
I've used it before.
- Give it to me.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.124
- Elmwood arms.
Room 104.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.993
There you'll find
benedict evers.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.395
- Good.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.530
- Hey! Hey!

39:27.599 --> 39:28.931
We had...

39:29.000 --> 39:31.267
We... We had a deal.

39:31.303 --> 39:32.535
- Mr. Rhodes,

39:32.670 --> 39:34.537
I am true to my oath.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.539
I gave you a mild paralytic.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.475
You should be fine
in a few hours.
(chuckles)

39:39.511 --> 39:40.977
- What?

39:43.148 --> 39:45.881
- When we're in position,
wait for my signal.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.188
You don't need to be here,
julia.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.390
- Stop me.
(he sighs.)

39:56.694 --> 39:58.561
(knocking on door)

39:59.865 --> 40:01.564
- That you, williams?

40:01.699 --> 40:03.032
You have the rest of my money?

40:03.101 --> 40:04.967
- No, it's not williams!
You, get over there!

40:05.003 --> 40:06.836
Young lady, get out!
Go! Go on!

40:06.905 --> 40:08.571
- What's this about?
- Where's the antidote?

40:08.706 --> 40:11.040
- Antidote? I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.642
- I don't have time for this.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.177
The antidote: Now!

40:14.179 --> 40:16.345
Or you're a dead man.
(clicks gun)

40:20.118 --> 40:22.452
- Goodbye, susannah.
(baby babbling)

40:23.988 --> 40:26.589
You'll live in a much better
world than mine.

40:28.360 --> 40:33.262
And your mother's going to raise
you to be whoever you want.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.969
- It's time, william.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.343
- Can I have just
one more moment?

40:47.345 --> 40:49.479
<i> - I'm sorry.</i>

41:05.297 --> 41:07.296
- You lived a good life,

41:07.365 --> 41:09.432
Better than most.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.200
- I did.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.473
- But all things come to an end.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.349
- It's not time.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.364
(soft music)

41:46.938 --> 41:48.404
- Julia?

41:49.274 --> 41:52.742
- William, it's all right.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.444
Everything's going to be
all right.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.420
- Thank you, detective murdoch.

42:04.456 --> 42:06.822
I'm, uh, sure this was
very trying.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.893
- Yeah, I'm feeling better
by the hour.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.694
- You have
a most resourceful wife.

42:11.829 --> 42:14.196
(chuckles)
- what about the chemist?

42:14.266 --> 42:16.566
- He's currently facing
two charges,

42:16.701 --> 42:19.936
Although he is complaining
about brutality.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.406
You put a very dangerous man
away, detective.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.207
We are all very much
in your debt.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.244
- It's not my debt
you're in, it's julia's.

42:28.313 --> 42:31.547
- Frank rhodes has issued
a complaint against her.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.583
- Well, has he now?

42:33.652 --> 42:35.284
Well, I'm more than prepared--

42:35.287 --> 42:37.053
- Well, nothing will be required
of you, doctor ogden.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.455
The matter is quite closed.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.525
Frank rhodes' execution
is scheduled for today.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.360
- That was fast.

42:44.362 --> 42:48.397
- I don't believe frank rhodes
deserves another day
above the soil, do you?

42:54.039 --> 42:58.140
- With your permission, sir,
I'd like to spend
the next day or two at home.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.209
- Of course.
You've both earned it.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.510
Get some rest.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.451
(dramatic music)

43:10.689 --> 43:12.287
- Hello, frank.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.562
- No.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.897
- It is finally time.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.704
(epic music)

43:41.819 --> 43:44.854
Subtitling: Difuze
