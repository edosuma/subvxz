00:00.449 --> 00:02.434
<i>If someone asked me the
biggest difference</i>

00:02.435 --> 00:04.049
<i>between the suburbs
and Manhattan,</i>

00:04.422 --> 00:05.742
<i>I will have to say...</i>

00:05.763 --> 00:07.383
<i>It's the moms.</i>

00:07.636 --> 00:09.236
<i>It's like the million mom march</i>

00:09.303 --> 00:11.003
<i>the places crawling with them.</i>

00:11.125 --> 00:12.445
<i>They're in the malls,</i>

00:12.659 --> 00:14.559
<i>they're at the rock concerts,</i>

00:14.618 --> 00:16.718
<i>they're shuffling out
of the tanning salon</i>

00:16.950 --> 00:19.650
<i>with their manipedi flip flops,
with theirs ever present daughters,</i>

00:19.699 --> 00:22.099
<i>and enormous frozen coffee drinks.</i>

00:22.247 --> 00:25.047
<i>Now, the whole mom thing
is little foreign to me.</i>

00:25.090 --> 00:28.292
<i>My mom ducked out shortly after</i>
<i>they cut the umbilical cord,</i>

00:28.343 --> 00:30.294
<i>so having grown up</i>
<i>with just my dad</i>

00:30.345 --> 00:31.796
<i>really made me wonder.</i>

00:38.353 --> 00:41.055
What is it with these mothers?

00:42.590 --> 00:44.108
They're people, okay?

00:44.142 --> 00:45.693
Just like you and me.

00:45.727 --> 00:47.762
<i>Things had been</i>
<i>a little tense between us</i>

00:47.796 --> 00:49.396
<i>since the unauthorized</i>
<i>search and seizure</i>

00:49.430 --> 00:50.898
<i>dad conducted in my room.</i>

00:50.932 --> 00:52.399
<i>First he searched,</i>

00:52.433 --> 00:55.602
<i>then he had a total seizure.</i>

00:55.620 --> 00:57.805
<i>He pulled me out of school,</i>
<i>bubble-wrapped my life,</i>

00:57.839 --> 01:01.108
<i>and threw it in the back</i>
<i>of a moving truck.</i>

01:01.159 --> 01:02.626
<i>I went from here...</i>

01:02.661 --> 01:04.845
<i>Good-bye,</i>
<i>Washington Square Park.</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:08.349
<i>Good-bye,</i>
<i>sexually active classmates.</i>

01:08.383 --> 01:10.801
<i>To here.</i>

01:13.522 --> 01:16.357
<i>Pretty ironic</i>
<i>that a box full of rubbers</i>

01:16.391 --> 01:19.426
<i>landed me in a town</i>
<i>full of plastic.</i>

01:21.313 --> 01:23.681
What color
would you call that?

01:23.732 --> 01:26.400
Circus peanut?

01:26.434 --> 01:28.269
Or maybe it's more
in the vomit family.

01:28.303 --> 01:30.187
Well, I guess that depends
on what you ate,

01:30.238 --> 01:32.656
maybe... lobster bisque.

01:32.691 --> 01:34.275
No. No, I'm talking about

01:34.309 --> 01:37.611
your basic, run-of-the-mill,
stomach acid vomit.

01:37.645 --> 01:39.747
- Uh-huh.
- That's pretty much it, isn't it?

01:39.781 --> 01:41.699
Why don't you grab your bag

01:41.750 --> 01:45.152
and go criticize
the inside of the house?

01:47.789 --> 01:50.490
Yoo-hoo!
Neighbor!

01:50.509 --> 01:51.992
Yoo-hoo!

01:52.010 --> 01:53.427
Yoo-hoo!

01:53.461 --> 01:56.013
Hiya, neighbor. I'm Sheila.

01:56.047 --> 01:59.466
Are you the new family
from New York?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.068
Nice.

02:01.102 --> 02:05.039
What? You taught me
not to talk to strangers.

02:06.975 --> 02:09.476
Come on in. This is it.

02:09.509 --> 02:11.278
Huh?

02:11.313 --> 02:13.914
It's pretty big, right? Bigger
than your room in the city.

02:13.949 --> 02:15.516
Can you picture yourself

02:15.550 --> 02:18.235
living a-a normal,
adolescent existence here?

02:18.286 --> 02:20.054
I don't know.

02:20.088 --> 02:21.722
It's kind of girlie.

02:21.756 --> 02:23.157
Well, you're a girl.

02:23.191 --> 02:27.044
Yeah, but I'm not a cat clock
kind of girl.

02:27.078 --> 02:30.297
What if you <i>are</i>
a cat clock kind of girl

02:30.332 --> 02:31.799
and you just don't know it yet?

02:31.833 --> 02:33.384
Yeah.

02:33.418 --> 02:35.302
I'm not.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.509
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>i was startled awake</i>

02:42.544 --> 02:44.261
<i>by an unfamiliar sound...</i>

02:44.312 --> 02:47.097
<i>No garbage trucks,</i>
<i>no taxi cabs,</i>

02:47.148 --> 02:49.516
<i>no car alarms?</i>

02:49.551 --> 02:51.068
<i>Silence.</i>

02:52.721 --> 02:54.488
It's too quiet.

02:58.193 --> 02:59.627
Yoo-hoo!

02:59.661 --> 03:03.330
Tell your wife I'm gonna
drop off a pot roast!

03:03.365 --> 03:04.798
Uh, I don't have a wife.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.967
Don't have
a wife. Don't have a wife.

03:07.002 --> 03:08.435
Don't have a wife.

03:10.038 --> 03:11.839
Crap.

03:11.873 --> 03:14.124
Okay, so you... you ready
for your welcome present?

03:14.175 --> 03:15.909
Oh, my God.
Is it a car?

03:15.927 --> 03:18.262
I might have oversold.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.517
Ta-da!

03:23.551 --> 03:27.521
"Ta-da" is what you say
when something good happens.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.423
Come on.
It's... it's cool.

03:29.441 --> 03:31.325
Yeah. I can keep
my adult undergarments

03:31.359 --> 03:32.893
in the wicker basket.

03:32.928 --> 03:33.515
Stop it.

03:33.516 --> 03:35.863
This is an elderly
person's bike, George.

03:35.897 --> 03:38.232
- Don't call me George.
- This is Betty white's bike.

03:38.266 --> 03:40.868
And besides,
I don't even know how to ride.

03:40.902 --> 03:42.453
Well, learning is gonna be

03:42.487 --> 03:44.872
one of the fun suburban things
we get to do together.

03:44.906 --> 03:46.940
But as for today,
you're gonna have to walk

03:46.958 --> 03:49.326
because I have a consultation
on a remodel

03:49.377 --> 03:52.346
right after my breakfast
at the country club.

03:52.380 --> 03:55.049
Breakfast at the country club?

03:55.083 --> 03:55.490
Mm-hmm.

03:55.491 --> 03:57.117
Do you realize that
your street cred

03:57.152 --> 03:59.787
just disintegrated
with that very sentence?

03:59.821 --> 04:02.423
Didn't realize
I had street cred.

04:02.457 --> 04:03.974
- Now it's gone.
- Damn.

04:04.009 --> 04:07.528
And I'm sure the club sounds
a lot fancier than it is.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.470
Hi.

04:16.504 --> 04:17.971
Sorry. I don't...

04:18.005 --> 04:19.974
Belong here.

04:20.007 --> 04:22.142
George, buddy!
Over here in the shallow end!

04:22.177 --> 04:23.643
- Hey, honey.
- Yeah!

04:23.662 --> 04:24.878
My friend.

04:24.913 --> 04:27.981
There you are!
What is up?

04:27.999 --> 04:29.199
Look at you!

04:29.250 --> 04:30.451
Oh, my God!

04:30.485 --> 04:32.652
Aah!
You're as pale as a corpse.

04:32.671 --> 04:35.205
Really? Well, you're... you're
the color of a nerf ball.

04:35.256 --> 04:37.491
I am sun-kissed.
Look at the face.

04:37.509 --> 04:39.626
You look exactly the same
as you did in college.

04:39.661 --> 04:41.628
Yeah, you do, too,
except maybe a little blonder.

04:41.662 --> 04:43.013
Are you blonder?

04:43.048 --> 04:45.933
I better be blonder. I spent
a lot of money to be blonder.

04:47.668 --> 04:49.336
We use foils.

04:49.354 --> 04:52.306
So how do you like suburbia?
It's gorgeous, right?

04:53.508 --> 04:56.310
I mean,
green grass, blue skies,

04:56.344 --> 04:57.978
nothing smells like urine...

04:58.012 --> 04:59.813
Look at this. She's texting.

04:59.848 --> 05:01.849
That woman's about to walk
into the pool. Ma'am!

05:01.883 --> 05:04.318
Ma'am! Ma'am! Whoa!

05:04.369 --> 05:06.403
You'd be amazed
how often that happens.

05:06.454 --> 05:07.921
Good news is,

05:07.956 --> 05:11.592
because of the implants,
nobody drowns.

05:11.626 --> 05:13.193
They're completely buoyant.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.629
All of 'em.
You are gonna have a field day.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.697
Yeah, well, this might come
as a surprise to you,

05:17.716 --> 05:19.833
but that kind of thing
doesn't really appeal to me.

05:19.868 --> 05:21.201
I'm more attracted to

05:21.236 --> 05:23.303
the school system,
the clean air.

05:23.338 --> 05:25.506
But you can't have sex with
the school system. Not really.

05:25.540 --> 05:28.175
I mean,
you came here for the kid.

05:28.209 --> 05:29.593
I get that.

05:29.644 --> 05:32.012
I'm just saying that this whole
displaced new yorker thing

05:32.046 --> 05:33.597
you've got going
is gonna kill out here.

05:33.648 --> 05:35.549
It's gonna kill.
Mm.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.684
Look. Our waitress is
eye-humping you right now.

05:38.887 --> 05:40.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:40.588 --> 05:42.937
Would you gentlemen care to
hear our specials today?

05:42.938 --> 05:43.524
Ooh.

05:43.558 --> 05:45.826
We have a seafood eggs Benedict

05:45.860 --> 05:47.795
served with
the blackened shrimp.

05:47.829 --> 05:50.831
We also have
an extremely tender, local,

05:50.865 --> 05:53.066
farm-raised waitress
named Jocelyn

05:53.084 --> 05:55.669
served on a bed
of your choosing.

05:59.841 --> 06:01.742
I'm gonna have the shrimp.

06:01.776 --> 06:05.095
Shrimp... shrimp's probably
a better choice.

06:07.782 --> 06:11.084
<i>To properly navigate suburbia,</i>

06:11.102 --> 06:13.620
<i>one needs a stay-at-home mom</i>
<i>to drive you places.</i>

06:13.655 --> 06:17.524
<i>Without one, you're living</i>
<i>like the early settler.</i>

06:17.559 --> 06:20.694
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>is</i> that <i>what dad wanted?</i>

06:20.728 --> 06:23.464
<i>For me to become</i>
<i>some zombie-eyed girl</i>

06:23.498 --> 06:26.733
<i>in the back</i>
<i>of a fully loaded S.U.V.?</i>

06:26.767 --> 06:28.769
Yo!

06:28.803 --> 06:31.572
<i>At that precise moment,</i>
<i>i had no idea what it was.</i>

06:31.606 --> 06:33.207
Ow.

06:33.241 --> 06:34.875
<i>But I would later find out</i>

06:34.909 --> 06:37.944
<i>this was the official drink</i>
<i>of suburbanites.</i>

06:37.962 --> 06:41.198
<i>It was sugarfree Red Bull.</i>

06:44.285 --> 06:46.120
Are you a lesbian?

06:46.154 --> 06:51.024
You mean because I'm not dressed
like I have a pole in my locker?

06:51.059 --> 06:53.293
Those are lesbian boots.

06:53.328 --> 06:57.097
Tessa, I'm Mr. Wolf,
your guidance counselor.

06:57.132 --> 07:00.434
I'm here to help you
absolutely any time you need...

07:00.468 --> 07:02.803
Between the hour
of 12:00 and 12:45 P.M.

07:02.837 --> 07:06.773
And this is Dalia.
Dalia is your buddy.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.909
How so?

07:08.943 --> 07:11.578
Buddies are volunteers who show
new students around the school.

07:11.613 --> 07:13.046
For extra credit.

07:13.081 --> 07:14.498
For extra credit.

07:14.582 --> 07:16.984
- Buddies are not your friends.
- Not necessarily, no.

07:17.018 --> 07:19.987
Have you ever thought of maybe
calling them something else?

07:20.021 --> 07:21.922
<i>That look said it all...</i>

Coming!

07:44.222 --> 07:46.973
Hi. I'm Dallas.

07:47.024 --> 07:49.443
You must be
George the architect.

07:49.477 --> 07:52.896
Wow. That... that is <i>not</i>
a good way to answer the door.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.331
Beg pardon?

07:54.365 --> 07:56.333
Well, you j... you just
supplied a complete stranger

07:56.367 --> 07:58.268
with all the information
he would need.

07:58.302 --> 08:00.370
All the information
he would need for what?

08:00.404 --> 08:02.772
He could just say,
"why, yes, Dallas,

08:02.790 --> 08:05.108
I am George the architect,"

08:05.126 --> 08:08.795
and... and step inside
your insanely lavish foyer

08:08.830 --> 08:10.997
and, you know...

08:14.085 --> 08:17.120
So are you an architect
or are you gonna come in

08:17.138 --> 08:18.839
and...

08:18.890 --> 08:20.690
'Cause you look like
an architect.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.259
I'm an architect.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.895
Okay, good.
So come on in.

08:24.929 --> 08:28.631
This is Dalia's bedroom.

08:28.649 --> 08:30.466
She's my princess.

08:30.485 --> 08:31.818
My miracle.

08:31.853 --> 08:33.520
This is
where we keep her denim,

08:33.604 --> 08:35.572
and that's her shoe closet,

08:35.606 --> 08:39.042
segregated by heels, wedges,
flats, and mules.

08:39.076 --> 08:40.243
Mules?

08:40.278 --> 08:42.312
Those are backless shoes,
George.

08:42.346 --> 08:44.781
And this is her...

08:44.815 --> 08:47.701
Creation station...

08:47.752 --> 08:50.921
Home of her blushers,
her lip lacquers,

08:50.955 --> 08:53.156
her nail care...

08:55.359 --> 08:57.060
Her hair extensions,

08:57.094 --> 08:59.513
her tanning solutions
and so forth.

08:59.547 --> 09:02.399
You got the whole
teenage girl thing down.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.500
Girls can be so insecure
at this age,

09:04.519 --> 09:06.703
and I just want my Dalia
to feel beautiful,

09:06.737 --> 09:08.338
hence the renovation.

09:08.372 --> 09:10.273
I would like a skylight

09:10.308 --> 09:12.976
put over
the place where she slumbers.

09:14.312 --> 09:17.347
Can I...

09:17.365 --> 09:18.815
Can I ask you a question

09:18.849 --> 09:20.250
completely unrelated
to the skylight?

09:20.284 --> 09:21.685
Well, of course.

09:21.719 --> 09:23.570
What would a mom like you do

09:23.621 --> 09:25.722
if you found condoms
in her drawer?

09:25.756 --> 09:28.208
What kind of condoms?

09:28.242 --> 09:29.926
Uh, latex.

09:29.961 --> 09:31.328
Opened or unopened?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.495
- Oh, unopened.
- Okay.

09:32.529 --> 09:33.830
Unopened box of condoms

09:33.865 --> 09:36.466
that she said belonged
to a friend of hers.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.668
I think I would have
to trust her.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.904
After all, they were
just in the drawer.

09:40.938 --> 09:42.806
She wasn't trying very hard
to hide them,

09:42.840 --> 09:46.710
which makes me think she must
trust me, so I would trust her.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.979
Oh, George,

09:49.013 --> 09:52.082
it must be hard raising her
all on your own.

09:52.116 --> 09:55.151
Okay.
So people around here gossip.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.454
It's just neighbors
being neighbors,

09:57.488 --> 09:59.289
but I'll tell you
who to watch out for.

09:59.323 --> 10:00.857
Sheila.
Sheila Shay?

10:00.891 --> 10:03.393
She's had 14 fibroids removed
from her u-taytay.

10:03.427 --> 10:05.061
Anyway, she's a real gossip.

10:05.096 --> 10:07.163
Uh, yeah,
actually, Sheila Shay...

10:07.198 --> 10:10.617
She dropped off a pot roast
for us this morning.

10:10.668 --> 10:12.335
Well, it takes a village.

10:12.370 --> 10:14.271
Yeah, but what Tessa
really needs

10:14.305 --> 10:16.206
doesn't come
in a cast-iron pot.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.375
She needs
some of this motherly love.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.676
Oh.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.611
Yeah, maybe a unicorn

10:21.646 --> 10:23.480
and some sparkly stuff.

10:23.514 --> 10:25.382
Maybe some dead hair.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.618
Well, you're in luck, 'cause you
are looking at the mall queen.

10:28.686 --> 10:30.420
I can give you a guided tour.

10:30.454 --> 10:32.272
Maybe even today
after school.

10:32.306 --> 10:34.774
We could take Tessa to all
of Dalia's favorite shops.

10:34.809 --> 10:36.359
Oh, she will love it,

10:36.394 --> 10:39.396
and she'll love Dalia.
Everybody does.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.531
<i>I hated Dalia.</i>

10:41.565 --> 10:44.367
<i>Her personality was</i>
<i>as flat as her hair.</i>

10:44.402 --> 10:47.237
Glee club.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.039
Bleachers.

10:49.073 --> 10:51.875
Cafeteria.

10:53.744 --> 10:54.995
Nose job.

10:55.046 --> 10:57.213
Nose job.
Nose job. Nose job.

10:57.248 --> 10:59.633
I guess I know what
the most popular elective is.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.335
Diversity student.

11:02.386 --> 11:03.987
Malik.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.157
Hello.

11:07.191 --> 11:09.359
Oral arts.

11:09.393 --> 11:11.845
What's wrong with those two?

11:11.896 --> 11:14.514
They have team spirit.

11:14.565 --> 11:18.101
And is that just something
that clears up on its own?

11:18.135 --> 11:21.637
<i>Of all the places on my tour,</i>

11:21.656 --> 11:24.007
<i>i liked</i>
<i>the handicapped bathroom best.</i>

11:24.041 --> 11:25.775
<i>In Manhattan,</i>
<i>the handicapped bathroom</i>

11:25.809 --> 11:27.994
<i>would have leased</i>
<i>for $950 a month.</i>

11:28.029 --> 11:30.080
<i>I stayed there</i>
<i>all through lunch.</i>

11:34.285 --> 11:36.219
So, Lisa,

11:36.253 --> 11:38.188
your brother must
be really jealous of you.

11:38.222 --> 11:41.725
Why would he be
jealous of me?

11:41.759 --> 11:44.127
Well, because you can grow
a mustache, and he can't.

11:48.132 --> 11:51.368
Did you see her face?

11:51.402 --> 11:54.020
<i>I had not intended to make</i>
<i>any new friends.</i>

11:54.055 --> 11:56.973
<i>My plan was to serve my time</i>
<i>and get out.</i>

11:57.007 --> 11:59.842
<i>But this girl looked even</i>
<i>more miserable than I was.</i>

11:59.860 --> 12:02.562
Hey. I know how it feels
to get picked on,

12:02.613 --> 12:04.680
and if you ever need
anyone to talk to...

12:04.699 --> 12:06.516
Stay away from me,
you lesbian!

12:11.629 --> 12:13.930
<i>So my classmates thought</i>
<i>i was a "vagitarian,"</i>

12:14.478 --> 12:16.496
<i>my dad thought I was a nympho,</i>

12:16.530 --> 12:18.498
<i>and I was starting to feel like</i>

12:18.549 --> 12:21.050
<i>i was living in a horror movie,</i>

12:21.085 --> 12:24.387
<i>some white picket fence</i>
<i>nightmare.</i>

12:24.421 --> 12:28.391
<i>They say New York is</i>
<i>intimidating,</i>

12:28.425 --> 12:32.962
<i>but these people seem like</i>
<i>the type who'd eat their young.</i>

12:32.997 --> 12:35.899
<i>I was halfway home...</i>

12:38.319 --> 12:40.603
<i>When I got body-snatched.</i>

12:41.855 --> 12:42.972
Tessa.

12:43.007 --> 12:44.107
Dad.

12:44.141 --> 12:46.209
What are you doing here?

12:46.243 --> 12:48.011
Whose car is this?

12:48.045 --> 12:51.247
Hey, girl!
I'm a friend of your daddy's.

12:51.282 --> 12:51.802
She is?

12:51.803 --> 12:53.883
Don't be rude, Tessa.
Get in the car.

13:06.864 --> 13:09.465
<i>They were taking me</i>
<i>to the one place on Earth</i>

13:09.499 --> 13:11.684
<i>they knew</i>
<i>i would never survive...</i>

13:11.719 --> 13:15.972
<i>The juniors section</i>
<i>at the mall.</i>

13:16.006 --> 13:19.192
Oh, my gosh! Look how cute
these boyfriend shorts are!

13:19.226 --> 13:22.946
I mean, whose boyfriend
are we talking about?

13:22.980 --> 13:24.447
This will show off
my belly ring.

13:24.481 --> 13:26.181
You know what else
those will show off?

13:26.182 --> 13:26.733
Your vagina.

13:26.784 --> 13:28.818
Are... are the lights
really bright in here?

13:28.852 --> 13:31.520
I feel... I feel like
there's less oxygen somehow.

13:31.538 --> 13:33.406
Oh, sweetheart.
Is the music especially loud in here?

13:33.457 --> 13:35.525
I feel like the music is
especially loud in here.

13:35.559 --> 13:37.193
- Honey. Honey.
- What?

13:37.211 --> 13:38.878
You need to go grab a snack
at the food court,

13:38.912 --> 13:41.030
and then have a seat over there
on the dad couch.

13:41.048 --> 13:42.865
D... oh.

13:42.883 --> 13:44.884
Yeah, okay. Oh, sweetheart,
you want anything?

13:44.918 --> 13:46.302
No, she certainly does not.

13:46.337 --> 13:48.471
We don't gorge ourselves
on salty snacks

13:48.505 --> 13:50.673
while we're trying on clothes.
Why?

13:50.707 --> 13:52.642
- Bloating.
- That's just girl 101.

13:52.676 --> 13:54.377
Bloating. Okay, girl 101.

13:54.395 --> 13:57.063
Right. Okay. I'm gonna, uh,
go sit on the dad couch,

13:57.097 --> 13:59.816
stay out of your way,
let the ladies do their thang.

13:59.850 --> 14:02.552
Hey. Look at this. Cute.

14:02.586 --> 14:04.487
If if you run into my dad,

14:04.521 --> 14:07.390
tell him I hate it here
and I want to go home.

14:08.525 --> 14:09.859
Just kidding.

14:09.893 --> 14:10.927
Mom.

14:10.961 --> 14:14.247
Ooh, it's a little long.
I could hem it.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.304
It's so lame your mom died,
beeyotch.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.574
- My mom...  Didn't die.
- She's just gone.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.575
So you became a lesbian
to get back at her.

14:26.593 --> 14:28.077
What?

14:28.095 --> 14:30.613
Tessa, if you need any
help or you have any questions

14:30.647 --> 14:33.950
or you feel lost
or unattractive in any way,

14:33.984 --> 14:35.518
just let me know.

14:35.552 --> 14:37.770
I know why
we're doing all this.

14:37.805 --> 14:39.989
It's because your mom
feels sorry for me.

14:40.024 --> 14:42.758
No, it's because my mom wants
to screw your dad.

14:42.776 --> 14:45.595
Doesn't your mom
screw <i>your</i> dad?

14:45.629 --> 14:47.030
No.

14:47.064 --> 14:49.265
The suspense is killing me.

14:49.283 --> 14:51.434
I'm dying to see how cute
you girls look.

14:51.452 --> 14:53.036
I'm buying this.

14:53.070 --> 14:54.971
Oh, my goodness, Tessa.

14:55.005 --> 14:56.489
Look at you.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.324
That is a keeper.

14:58.375 --> 15:01.044
That top is just off
the chizzy, is it not?

15:01.078 --> 15:03.279
Oh, this is going straight
to the register.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.331
Hey.
Oh, honey, it's just us girls.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.550
Oh, dear Lord.
Who did this to you?

15:07.584 --> 15:08.618
What?

15:08.652 --> 15:11.754
This?

15:11.789 --> 15:14.424
I-I ordered it from
a sporting good catalog.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.125
What's the problem?

15:16.143 --> 15:18.461
Well,
it's downright orthopedic.

15:18.479 --> 15:20.646
It's like a giant ace bandage,

15:20.731 --> 15:22.648
like something
a burn victim would wear.

15:22.683 --> 15:24.067
Are you calling my bra ugly?

15:24.101 --> 15:26.135
Well, yes, honey, I am,
because it is ugly,

15:26.153 --> 15:28.438
and I would love to find one
for you that isn't,

15:28.472 --> 15:30.973
along with a nice,
heterosexual dress shoe.

15:35.112 --> 15:38.514
<i>That night,</i>
<i>I decided to debut a new look.</i>

15:38.549 --> 15:40.983
<i>I called it mall skank.</i>

15:41.018 --> 15:43.920
Tessa, please.
Dinner's getting cold.

15:43.954 --> 15:46.823
What are we eating?
It smells like passover.

15:46.857 --> 15:49.375
Oh, there she is!
Cute outfit alert.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.843
- Cute outfit alert.
- Hey!

15:50.928 --> 15:52.345
What... what is that?
What are you wearing?

15:52.379 --> 15:55.381
Uh, this is the outfit
you bought me at the mall.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.100
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah.

15:57.134 --> 15:59.335
No. All right, let's eat.

15:59.369 --> 16:00.903
Can I say something?

16:00.938 --> 16:03.039
This is really nice,
isn't it?

16:03.073 --> 16:05.358
Yes. When was the last time
dad put a home-cooked meal

16:05.392 --> 16:07.243
- on the table?
- I brought my own dinner.

16:07.277 --> 16:09.112
Okay, that is not dinner.

16:09.146 --> 16:12.532
Uh, haven't you heard?

16:12.566 --> 16:14.283
George, the girls here
don't eat dinner.

16:14.318 --> 16:17.686
That's how they keep their
body weight under 80 pounds.

16:17.704 --> 16:19.205
Bikini ready by summer.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.357
Don't you open that drink.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.893
You want me to be just like
the suburban girls, don't you?

16:23.927 --> 16:25.695
Don't you dare open that drink,
Tessa.

16:25.729 --> 16:27.914
No, I forbid you to open that...

16:27.965 --> 16:29.865
Ooh.

16:29.883 --> 16:32.435
Don't even put that straw
in that can.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.604
- That's the last straw.
- Do...

16:34.638 --> 16:37.473
- Tessa, don't you dare take a sip.
- She's gonna take a sip.

16:37.508 --> 16:39.258
That is not your dinner.
This is your dinner.

16:39.309 --> 16:40.810
Ahh!

16:40.844 --> 16:42.711
O... you know what, then?

16:42.729 --> 16:45.114
Then you... you're gonna go to bed
without dinner.

16:45.149 --> 16:47.283
Oh, God, George!

16:47.317 --> 16:49.569
- Well...
- I don't even recognize you.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.988
It's like... it's like
you're one of <i>them.</i>

16:52.022 --> 16:54.273
- What'd I do?
- Sweetheart, I'm trying to give you

16:54.324 --> 16:55.992
what all these other girls have.

16:56.026 --> 16:57.827
Oh, well, I'm not
all these other girls,

16:57.861 --> 17:00.630
and I don't want
what they have!

17:00.664 --> 17:01.998
All right.

17:02.032 --> 17:04.282
This was voted
the fifth best place

17:04.334 --> 17:06.836
in the country to raise kids.

17:06.869 --> 17:08.304
I don't have kids.

17:08.338 --> 17:10.173
You ruined my life!

17:10.207 --> 17:14.310
Oh, I did not ruin your life!

17:16.012 --> 17:18.580
I think I ruined her life.

17:19.074 --> 17:20.973
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>we didn't speak much.</i>

17:22.076 --> 17:23.943
<i>Instead, dad and I</i>
<i>expressed our feelings</i>

17:23.978 --> 17:26.746
<i>through passive-aggressive</i>
<i>reference books.</i>

17:30.751 --> 17:31.985
Okay.

17:32.019 --> 17:34.020
Remember that time
you got me that goldfish

17:34.054 --> 17:35.655
and you said I had to take care
of it all by myself

17:35.689 --> 17:37.290
and I was so excited
to show you that I could

17:37.324 --> 17:38.658
that I rushed home from school
and I cleaned out the bowl,

17:38.692 --> 17:40.076
and I changed the water,
and I threw the fish in there,

17:40.111 --> 17:41.828
but the water was too cold
and the fish went into shock

17:41.862 --> 17:44.731
and got these little tiny
bubbles all over his body

17:44.765 --> 17:46.433
and then died?

17:48.269 --> 17:49.369
Yeah.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.671
I feel like the fish.

17:51.705 --> 17:54.240
Okay.

17:54.275 --> 17:57.010
Well...

17:57.044 --> 17:59.579
You remember the time I-I tried
to show you that Fellini movie

17:59.613 --> 18:01.464
and you refused to watch it
because it was

18:01.515 --> 18:03.216
in black and white
and had subtitles

18:03.250 --> 18:04.984
and you said
it looked dumb and boring,

18:05.019 --> 18:07.020
but then they made you
watch it at school

18:07.054 --> 18:08.888
and it turned out
you actually loved it?

18:10.758 --> 18:11.891
Yeah.

18:11.926 --> 18:15.228
I feel like this is
a Fellini movie.

18:21.702 --> 18:23.937
Oh. Hello.

18:23.971 --> 18:26.406
My mom sent me over here
to get her pot back.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.942
Oh, I didn't take
your mom's pot.

18:28.976 --> 18:30.577
I don't even smoke pot.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.445
Her pot...

18:32.480 --> 18:33.880
From last night?

18:33.914 --> 18:36.316
It's red with
a silver rooster on it?

18:36.350 --> 18:38.952
How'd that roast
work out for you?

18:38.986 --> 18:42.355
That's your mom?

18:42.389 --> 18:43.990
Yeah.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.561
Is that your brother?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.267
Yeah.

18:58.906 --> 19:00.440
Come on in.

19:00.474 --> 19:01.975
We didn't clean it.

19:02.009 --> 19:03.910
That's okay.

19:05.246 --> 19:07.947
I only freaked out on you
in the girls' room

19:07.982 --> 19:10.216
because I didn't want
to get made fun of anymore.

19:10.251 --> 19:12.685
Yeah. I get it.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.953
It's okay.

19:13.988 --> 19:16.172
We're cool.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.592
Cool.

19:29.637 --> 19:32.972
Tessa? Your dad said
I could come up.

19:34.058 --> 19:36.376
Can I come in?

19:36.410 --> 19:37.911
You're already in.

19:39.947 --> 19:42.815
Um, about the other day,

19:42.849 --> 19:45.885
I acted like a biznitch,

19:45.920 --> 19:49.222
and I just wanted to say
how sorry I am.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.524
It's just,
I'm of the mind... set

19:51.542 --> 19:55.762
that every girl
should be given a bra

19:55.796 --> 19:58.998
by somebody who knows
a thing or two about bras.

20:04.672 --> 20:07.557
Well, I will leave
the two of you alone.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.347
<i>It was presumptuous.</i>

20:14.381 --> 20:16.849
<i>It was inappropriate,</i>

20:16.883 --> 20:20.186
<i>and it was by far,</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:22.522
<i>the prettiest thing I owned.</i>

20:23.791 --> 20:27.193
<i>So maybe these moms</i>

<i>That's when I realized,</i>

20:49.082 --> 20:52.385

20:52.419 --> 20:55.188
<i>Dad was here, too.</i>

20:55.222 --> 20:56.789
Yoo-hoo! George!

20:56.824 --> 20:59.158

<i>Automatic sprinklers...</i>

21:20.214 --> 21:21.981
- Beautiful.
