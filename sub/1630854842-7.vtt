WEBVTT

00:43.166 --> 00:45.083
-Is anyone following?
-No.

00:45.166 --> 00:48.166
But I wouldn't put it past Kipps
and that maniac from the library.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.625
Do you think Penelope saw us?

00:49.708 --> 00:53.291
Well, after tonight, I think we'll both
be off her Christmas card list.

00:53.375 --> 00:56.208
Did you see that box she gave him?
It had that symbol on it.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.291
The one George found on Fairfax's goggles.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.791
-What, the harp?
-Yes.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.458
And we know what a certified bastard
he turned out to be.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.416
Still, we got the book.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.291
-We did.
-Let's find the bone glass.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.333
Let's finish this.

02:24.708 --> 02:28.125
Evening, Karim. Best stay out of sight.
Don't wanna get spotted.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.916
Why are we here?
The auction's miles away.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.125
Winkman's goons are everywhere.
Any closer, they'll see us.

02:34.375 --> 02:37.791
Oh, Jesus. Look at the smile on him.
This won't end well.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.541
-You're late.
-Sorry. Things got a bit weird.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.125
-I think--
-Did you get the Dulac book?

02:42.208 --> 02:44.208
Yeah, course we did. Now, what's the plan?

02:44.291 --> 02:47.583
The auction's starting any minute
and Winkman's locked down the streets.

02:47.666 --> 02:49.041
So, basically, we're screwed.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.583
Oh, have a little faith, George.
London ain't just streets, you know.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.125
Now stay close and no talking.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.125
Don't know why
I didn't think of this.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.166
It's what you pay me for, Locky.

03:31.916 --> 03:34.250
Is this it? Looks deserted.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.166
That gangway takes you
to the back of Fothergill's.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.416
No entrance from the street,
but there's a hatch into the basement.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.333
It's unlocked. I've made sure.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.833
Get in, get out, and get back.

03:44.916 --> 03:47.000
But give me a warning.
I can't wait out here.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.208
It's way too exposed. Radio me.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.291
You're the best, Flo.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Hold up.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.125
I need one of you to stay.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.250
Whatever you do, you'll be coming out hot.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.291
To get away quick enough,
I need someone else doing this shit.

04:02.583 --> 04:03.875
We could draw straws.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.875
Don't be kind. It's unbearable.
It's clearly me.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.916
-You don't mind?
-Of course I mind.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.291
Who gives a shit? This is Bickerstaff's
bone glass. We have to get it.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.333
Don't mess this up.

04:19.625 --> 04:20.583
Be careful.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.750
They're a lot worse than ghosts.

05:17.041 --> 05:19.750
-And it's locked.
-Bring that one. Hurry up.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.708
-Through there.
-Drag it.

05:21.791 --> 05:24.166
-Bring that one as well. There's more.
-Come on.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.291
Bring that--

05:25.375 --> 05:27.250
-Drag it through. Going in.
-Shit!

05:28.541 --> 05:30.583
-Bring it down here now.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.125
Put it there.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.416
Shit. The hatch is unlocked.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.125
If Julius sees this…

05:47.833 --> 05:49.541
-Right, let's get the other one.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.750
Yeah. Just give me a sec.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.958
On the other side of that door,
there's about 30 blokes who'll kill you.

06:07.625 --> 06:08.791
Two sets of footprints.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.333
And I caught a glimpse
of a rapier back there.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.625
You've got three seconds to come out.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.041
Jesus, you're children.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.875
We're agents working on behalf of DEPRAC.

06:26.583 --> 06:27.791
As I assume you are too.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.791
You're undercover?
How many other agents are here?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.583
None. Including you.

06:33.666 --> 06:35.583
You're leaving. Now.

06:35.666 --> 06:38.458
We can help each other out.
We're here to get the mirror too.

06:38.541 --> 06:42.083
I'm here to infiltrate Winkman's
organization. You're not messing that up.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.708
-You don't understand. This mirror--
-Listen to me.

06:45.208 --> 06:48.000
I have a wife and daughter
I haven't seen for five months.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.958
This is my job.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.958
Do you have the first clue
who these people are?

06:53.041 --> 06:56.041
-What they do to their enemies?
-What's in those drums?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.458
You don't wanna know.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.750
-And the padlock?
-I don't have a key.

07:07.916 --> 07:10.416
We are not leaving without that mirror.

07:11.291 --> 07:15.708
I'm a DEPRAC officer and I'm ordering you.
Get out before you get us all killed.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.750
Straight out of here,
there's a door to the dock.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.458
I'm gonna leave and walk right past it.

07:23.041 --> 07:26.291
Once the guards have moved,
make a run for it and don't look back.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.166
This is all I can do for you.
If it goes wrong, you're on your own.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.333
Huh.

07:43.833 --> 07:44.666
Okay.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.666
Okay.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.833
-Give us a hand?
-We're meant to stay here.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.291
-Mr. Winkman said it's fine.
-Come on.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.000
Come on. Quickly.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.416
Oh, this is it. We can make it.

08:15.541 --> 08:17.750
What are you doing?
Don't just stand there.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.083
No. No way. You're not doing this.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.333
I can't stop now.
I have to get the mirror.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.375
We have to get out and call DEPRAC.
We're not trained for this.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.208
Come on. He's taken a risk for us.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.833
Go.

08:33.666 --> 08:34.708
I have to stay.

08:43.583 --> 08:44.458
Ugh!

08:59.500 --> 09:01.041
They're wearing robes.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.583
Why are you doing this?
We could have made it!

09:06.666 --> 09:09.500
You should've gone. I never
asked you to wait. I told you to go.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.125
So I'm just gonna walk out of here
without you, am I?

09:12.208 --> 09:16.125
-Leave you to die and not look back?
-George? We're gonna need another exit.

09:19.833 --> 09:21.916
-George?
-Jesus Christ.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.708
You're incredible, you know?

09:25.791 --> 09:27.875
The way you can lie to yourself like that.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.500
-What are you talking about?
-Where do I start?

09:31.583 --> 09:35.458
This job has gotten so out of control,
and you just refuse to acknowledge it.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.708
All you care about is winning.

09:37.791 --> 09:40.750
-It's… it's an obsession.
-Yeah, of course I care about winning.

09:40.833 --> 09:44.833
I have to. I don't have anyone around me
to pick up the pieces if I fail.

09:44.916 --> 09:45.750
Okay.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.166
If there are things
I haven't told you about myself,

09:48.250 --> 09:49.916
it's probably for your own good.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.083
Bullshit.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.291
Two hours ago, at that party,

09:53.375 --> 09:55.916
you were petrified
at the thought of me leaving you.

09:56.416 --> 09:59.625
You made me believe that
you, me, and George could be a family.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.500
But Lockwood & Co. can never be that,
because at the center of it is you.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.875
-And at the center of you is just a--
-Is what?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.750
-A cold, dead heart of stone?
-Yeah, maybe.

10:09.833 --> 10:13.166
But who knows, though?
'Cause you don't actually show anyone.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.166
Nothing good comes from letting people in.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.958
Everything ends and everyone leaves.

10:18.958 --> 10:22.250
When my time comes,
I don't intend on leaving anyone behind

10:22.333 --> 10:24.208
who's gonna lie there every night

10:24.291 --> 10:26.958
wishing I would just walk
through that door one more time.

10:27.041 --> 10:30.041
Then you never should have let me in.
Or George.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.500
Because now
it's far too late.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.000
There are two men out there
due back here any minute with a barrel.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.291
I don't plan on either of us
ending up in it.

10:45.375 --> 10:49.750
Whatever else you have to say about me,
Lucy, it's gonna have to wait.

10:50.625 --> 10:51.625
Put this on.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.458
Please, Lucy.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.791
We got lucky with this mist.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.750
Winkman's boys won't spot us
if we just hang back.

11:16.541 --> 11:17.791
You all right, Georgie?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.791
Can I call you Georgie?

11:20.708 --> 11:23.541
-You're keeping track of where we are?
-I've got it.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.125
Chill. We'll be there when they signal.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.166
Any idea how long they're gonna be?

11:31.250 --> 11:34.291
I didn't wanna mention it to Locky,
but I'm a bit double-booked.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.416
-What?
-I've had a tip-off.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.125
About something down Greenwich way.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.166
If Locky's gonna be a while,
we could pop over.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.291
You're joking.
We have to be there when they come out.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.208
I wouldn't leave them stranded, Georgie.

11:43.291 --> 11:46.250
-Just sayin', since we're doin' nothin'--
-What's the other item?

11:46.333 --> 11:48.958
A possessed toothbrush?
A mesmeric old boot?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.125
-Ssh! You hear that?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.958
What is it? It can't be a visitor.

11:54.041 --> 11:57.000
-Not on running water.
-The world's bigger than the Problem.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.125
-Are you sure you saw something?

12:00.833 --> 12:02.583
Georgie, where are you?

12:02.666 --> 12:04.333
I'm on a boat with a nutter.

12:04.416 --> 12:05.916
But where are you?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.166
I'm on the river.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.958
-But where?
-I don't know!

12:09.041 --> 12:11.250
You're with me, and you're safe.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.333
So put your rapier down.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.083
-Hold it together.
-<i>You </i>hold it together.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.458
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.666
-Old friends and new…
-Welcome, stragglers.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.000
-You have my word…
-Have fun.

13:20.083 --> 13:23.416
…that tonight's session
will be well worth your journey.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.625
We have a plethora of items
up for auction tonight,

13:27.708 --> 13:33.625
including a cigarette case
found on the beaches of Dunkirk,

13:33.708 --> 13:37.000
permeated with the torment
of a fallen son.

13:38.083 --> 13:42.666
The source of one of the nation's
most prolific murderers,

13:42.750 --> 13:44.416
Anne-Marie Nelson.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.041
-We want the mirror!
-Where is it?

13:47.125 --> 13:48.541
- Come on!

13:48.625 --> 13:49.791
Come on!

13:51.125 --> 13:52.375
Of course you do.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.416
And here she is.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.750
That rarity.

13:55.833 --> 13:59.625
The piece that has so exercised
the hard-working people at DEPRAC

13:59.708 --> 14:01.541
-these past few days.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.375
Recovered, at great cost,

14:03.458 --> 14:07.666
from the grave of the visionary genius
Sir Edmund Bickerstaff.

14:08.666 --> 14:09.875
We present to you

14:10.791 --> 14:12.333
his bone glass.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.416
A truly lethal item.

14:24.750 --> 14:29.291
The mirrored surface itself, which has
been covered for your protection,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.416
exudes a mesmeric attraction
more powerful…

14:33.500 --> 14:36.833
There's too many people.
Let's stay quiet and see who buys it.

14:37.916 --> 14:40.750
Flares? What am I supposed
to do with these?

14:40.833 --> 14:43.500
I need a distraction
to get to the mirror.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.583
-Look out, I'll give you a signal.
-Bone fragments were inset…

14:46.666 --> 14:48.041
This is insane.

14:49.833 --> 14:53.708
In my decades handling
relics of psychical significance,

14:53.791 --> 14:58.208
this mirror is the most powerful object
I've ever encountered.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.125
Your canaries may now approach.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.583
No, they're babies.
They can't handle this.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.625
-You, up. Get up.
-Up, up.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.291
-Up, up, up.
-Up, up. Up, up.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.916
-No!
-Turn.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.041
-No!
-Don't make me hurt you.

15:17.916 --> 15:21.708
A most emphatic
endorsement of authenticity,

15:21.791 --> 15:23.541
I'm sure you'll all agree.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.458
So, why don't we start the bidding

15:28.541 --> 15:31.000
at £50,000?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.375
50 in the front straightaway.
Thank you, madam. 50.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.791
60. Thank you. 60. 70.
70 at the back. 70, yes. Do I hear 80?

15:36.875 --> 15:38.500
80. 80,000…

15:39.333 --> 15:41.416
-90. 90…

15:43.333 --> 15:45.791
Flo? Flo, I think we're drifting.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.541
-Have we lost position?
-I doubt it.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.125
Don't worry, I'll check in a minute.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.458
Drink. It'll keep you warm.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.250
Doesn't it get lonely?

16:07.791 --> 16:09.583
The solitary relic woman life?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.458
Mathilda looks after me.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.083
And solitary is why I like it.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.166
That and the running water.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.833
Less ghosts.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.500
But it's also just good for work.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.208
The number of goodies
dumped in a river over centuries.

16:24.291 --> 16:27.125
-You mean lethal sources.
-Not just sources.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.833
Treasured things. Once loved, thrown away.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.416
Like this.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.208
That's… lovely.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.875
Found it round the neck
of a drowned Dalmatian. Hah!

16:39.458 --> 16:40.500
Who wore it best?

16:41.541 --> 16:42.916
Mm… You did.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.166
No way.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.500
I saw a heron!

16:52.625 --> 16:54.625
Oh, that's what it was back there.

16:54.708 --> 16:56.750
-Did you see it?
-No. A heron?

16:56.833 --> 16:58.291
You ever seen one up close?

16:58.958 --> 17:02.125
They're beautiful.
Wildest things you ever saw.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.041
Must be nesting
down Greenwich docks again.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.958
You want to abandon the mission
to go bird-watching?

17:11.041 --> 17:13.541
-What game are you playing?
-Nature's infinite majesty, Georgie.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.041
-Cuts through all the bullshit.
-Flo, no, no!

17:16.125 --> 17:17.833
We're staying here for the mirror.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.125
I know that.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.041
But you were right. We have drifted.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.500
And I need to get us back in position,
so you best let go.

17:41.791 --> 17:44.208
<i>Can I get 120?</i>
<i>120 there, thank you.</i>

17:44.291 --> 17:47.541
Looking for 130 now. 130.
130 there, thank you.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.708
Can I get 140?
140 there, thank you very much.

17:50.791 --> 17:54.958
Can I get £150,000 for this item?
150 in the room.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.166
160, please?

17:56.250 --> 17:59.416
-Here.
-160, yes. Can I get 170? 170--

17:59.500 --> 18:02.416
-£500,000.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.750
-What?
-Surely not…

18:04.833 --> 18:07.708
£500,000.

18:08.416 --> 18:09.833
Thank you very much, sir.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.250
Can I get 520?

18:14.250 --> 18:15.291
520, anyone?

18:15.958 --> 18:18.208
-Last chance. 520?

18:19.708 --> 18:23.250
No? Going once. Going twice.

18:24.208 --> 18:27.583
-520. Thank you very much, sir.
-What's he doing?

18:29.000 --> 18:29.916
550.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.791
-600.
-650.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.166
Uh, gentlemen,

18:38.666 --> 18:42.125
your enthusiasm for this item
exceeds my high expectations.

18:42.666 --> 18:47.125
Might I ask that you approach and provide
proof of means before we proceed?

18:48.750 --> 18:51.666
Just a formality,
of course, gentlemen.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.166
Thank you, sir.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.375
Thanks very much, sir.

19:05.916 --> 19:06.916
And you, sir.

19:14.541 --> 19:16.333
-In your own time, sir.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.208
He's got a rapier. He's an agent!

19:24.291 --> 19:26.541
Shit. Come on, come on, come on.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.708
-Come on.
-Get him up here now.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.875
Okay. Let's see who we've got here.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.333
You?

19:44.416 --> 19:47.583
Where's the other one?
There were two of them!

19:47.666 --> 19:49.416
-Out of my way!
-Find her.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.000
No one leaves this room.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.458
-She has to be here somewhere!

20:12.666 --> 20:14.166
-Stop him!

20:14.250 --> 20:15.500
Stop him, you cowards!

20:23.875 --> 20:25.250
How do we get out of here?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.333
It's padlocked!

20:29.583 --> 20:30.625
Down here!

20:34.208 --> 20:35.250
Easy now.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.833
Lockwood.

20:38.916 --> 20:41.291
It's okay. Give me the rapier.

20:42.250 --> 20:45.250
Give me the bone glass,
and I'll make this quick.

20:57.458 --> 20:58.791
Do you know him, do ya?

20:59.625 --> 21:00.458
No, boss.

21:01.208 --> 21:02.333
You sure about that?

21:03.583 --> 21:04.583
Yes, boss.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.458
Convince me.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.000
What?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
-I knew it, you snake!
-Stay back!

21:35.083 --> 21:37.833
I'm a DEPRAC officer. This place
is surrounded. Lay down your weapons.

21:37.916 --> 21:40.291
-You got family, mate? I'm gonna find 'em.
-George!

21:41.208 --> 21:42.708
-Get him!

21:50.416 --> 21:51.875
Go, Lockwood!

22:04.291 --> 22:06.583
George? We really need help.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.833
George!

22:09.750 --> 22:10.666
Come on.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.208
Shit! They've radioed up!
They're stopping the lift at four.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.083
They know we're coming.

22:17.666 --> 22:20.000
-We need to get out of here now!

22:24.791 --> 22:26.458
Where are the other sources?

22:33.166 --> 22:34.041
Go, go!

22:45.791 --> 22:47.250
Lockwood, snap out of it!

22:47.333 --> 22:48.875
They just killed him like that.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.125
I know. We need to go.

22:50.208 --> 22:52.375
-What did he die for?
-Because they're bastards!

22:52.458 --> 22:53.833
It's because I am.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.416
Lockwood. Please, Lockwood,
you can't do this right now.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.666
-They're up here!
-Lockwood, look at me!

22:58.750 --> 23:00.500
-Up these stairs!
-Yeah? You were right.

23:00.583 --> 23:01.875
The mirror is too important.

23:01.958 --> 23:04.958
Now, please, please, just get back
to being a flippant dickhead

23:05.041 --> 23:06.458
and get us through this.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.791
Ha-ha!

23:08.875 --> 23:10.000
Hello!

23:10.583 --> 23:12.500
-Come on!
-You're next!

23:12.583 --> 23:14.083
-No! Get back!

23:14.166 --> 23:15.750
-Get back, get back!
-Run!

23:49.916 --> 23:52.666
Has either of your colleagues
told you you look really unwell

23:52.750 --> 23:54.875
and seem a bit obsessed with this mirror?

23:56.375 --> 23:59.125
'Cause if you were on my watch,
I'd be saying, "Georgie,

23:59.208 --> 24:01.375
you've got a waxy air
of desperation, mate."

24:01.458 --> 24:04.625
"You need to step back and relax,
'cause something's eating you alive."

24:04.708 --> 24:07.083
You think I'm losing it?
At least I haven't given up.

24:07.166 --> 24:10.625
Look at you. You're the walking checklist
of ghost trauma.

24:13.125 --> 24:15.708
You don't know what happened,
and I ain't gonna tell you.

24:17.250 --> 24:21.041
I've seen more kids messed up by ghosts
than you'll meet in your life.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.125
And I see you.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.375
Where have you taken us?

24:40.041 --> 24:42.458
-Take us to the wharf.
-No.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.750
You're mesmerized, Georgie.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.291
We can smell our own.
I needed to get you away from it.

24:47.375 --> 24:50.708
-You're crazy! You sabotaged me!
-Only 'cause I like you.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.791
Get us to the wharf.

24:53.875 --> 24:56.458
-Get us to the wharf!

25:16.500 --> 25:17.375
I'm sorry.

25:17.458 --> 25:21.833
I'm so sorry. You were just trying
to help me, and I could've hurt you.

25:22.708 --> 25:26.958
Nah. Even with the rapier, you'd have been
dead before you hit the water.

25:27.041 --> 25:29.166
-<i>George? George!</i>

25:29.250 --> 25:32.000
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Yes! Are you at the pontoon?

25:32.083 --> 25:33.708
<i>-George! Can you hear us?</i>
-Lucy!

25:35.333 --> 25:38.375
-Let's go and get them.
-What about everything you just said?

25:38.916 --> 25:40.125
They'll have the mirror.

25:40.208 --> 25:42.791
I'll be with you,
and Locky will keep hold of it.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.541
You're an agent. You've got this.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.666
George?

26:07.750 --> 26:09.416
-Oh, George, come on!

26:14.041 --> 26:16.041
It is carnage down there.

26:16.833 --> 26:21.458
An impressive way to announce yourselves.
That's two parties you've ruined tonight.

26:21.958 --> 26:22.958
You were at the ball?

26:26.791 --> 26:29.083
You must be Lockwood & Co.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.583
You're that tosser with the golden blade.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.291
The "Golden Blade". I quite like that.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.291
How do you know who we are?

26:36.375 --> 26:38.916
Oh, it's the least
of what I know about you…

26:39.000 --> 26:40.041
Anthony.

26:42.208 --> 26:43.291
Now,

26:44.250 --> 26:46.958
give me my bone glass.

26:59.708 --> 27:03.208
Not quite up to the big leagues, are you?
You've got ambition at least.

27:06.833 --> 27:10.208
Sets you apart from the bottom feeders,
like that DEPRAC agent.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.000
Why would anyone do such a dangerous job
for so little money?

27:16.083 --> 27:17.958
That's enough about him.

27:24.333 --> 27:27.750
Get over it.
I'd already told Winkman who he was.

27:28.250 --> 27:31.500
I think they were planning to kill him
live on stage as a finale.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.166
You really ruined the end of that auction.

27:35.416 --> 27:36.541
You told him?

27:37.208 --> 27:38.250
How did you know?

27:40.000 --> 27:40.958
Who are you?

27:41.750 --> 27:42.666
Are you Fittes?

27:42.750 --> 27:44.750
I'm the iron in your sword.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.333
I'm the flame
that keeps the furnaces burning.

27:48.833 --> 27:49.833
Oh, shut up!

28:00.416 --> 28:02.083
Enthusiasm and technique.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.750
Enough to put you in the ground,
you pretentious prick.

28:18.875 --> 28:19.833
Oops.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.583
Drainpipe. We can climb down.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.500
That can't be our escape.

28:47.041 --> 28:47.875
Lucy?

28:49.125 --> 28:50.750
Lucy, we're here. Where are you?

28:55.166 --> 28:59.291
George. We're on the roof. There's no way
we're getting down to the pontoon.

28:59.375 --> 29:02.458
Come closer. We're gonna
have to throw it to you. Do you copy?

29:02.541 --> 29:04.583
-What if I lose it in the river?
<i>-You won't.</i>

29:04.666 --> 29:07.333
Plus we don't have any other choice.
Trust me, George.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.000
It has to come down to you now.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.083
<i>Catch it, and get it to DEPRAC.</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:13.875
We're gonna find our own way home.
Do you copy?

29:15.791 --> 29:18.166
-I copy, I copy.
-George, help me with the net.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.541
Get us out of here!

30:13.500 --> 30:15.833
That was mine!

30:15.916 --> 30:17.625
Oh, Jesus, give up!

30:17.708 --> 30:19.875
The bone glass is
with DEPRAC now. It's over.

30:19.958 --> 30:22.541
You don't understand
the game at all, do you?

30:26.708 --> 30:28.208
No. No, no, no, no, no.

30:31.041 --> 30:32.250
No, Lockwood.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.000
Lucy, he'll kill you!

31:09.416 --> 31:10.541
You're not coming in?

31:11.083 --> 31:12.708
Not sure they'd let me out again.

31:13.250 --> 31:17.041
Come on. You're strong enough.
You're literally at the door.

31:18.250 --> 31:19.083
Yeah.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.166
I did have another idea, though.

31:24.541 --> 31:28.083
What if we take Mathilda
out to the Medway? Forget this lot.

31:28.583 --> 31:31.958
We'll just drop it in where
it's so deep, no one will ever find it.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.708
And afterwards, maybe we could check out
this little island.

31:35.791 --> 31:38.041
There's loads of herons nesting on it.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.125
Or whatever.

31:42.791 --> 31:46.000
-You're here already, so…
-It's just… the plan.

31:47.416 --> 31:48.541
Yeah.

31:50.583 --> 31:51.416
Cool.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.000
See ya!

32:05.541 --> 32:06.500
Flo?

32:07.833 --> 32:08.750
Flo!

32:08.833 --> 32:11.208
You, me, and herons. Let's do it.

34:17.833 --> 34:18.875
Hello?

34:19.375 --> 34:20.375
I've got it.
