09:55.720 --> 09:58.098
WELL, JUST A MINUTE,
JUST A LITTLE MINUTE.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.923
FLOWERS, SEE?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.008
THAT'S VERY NICE,

10:04.562 --> 10:06.018
I COULDN'T HAVE
LASTED THE EVENING

10:06.106 --> 10:07.767
WITHOUT SEEING
YOU, LEILA.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.064
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO LOVE SOMEBODY

10:10.151 --> 10:12.859
TO LOVE ANYBODY SO MUCH
AND SO DESPERATELY.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.859
LOOK, CHAMPAGNE--

10:15.949 --> 10:17.360
JUST ENOUGH
FOR TWO GLASSES.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.690
THAT'S NOT
ASKING MUCH.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.071
JUST SPARE ME
FIVE MINUTES

10:20.161 --> 10:21.617
AND HAVE ONE
DRINK WITH ME.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.447
ROGER, YOU ARE
ACTING LIKE A CLOD--

10:25.542 --> 10:28.751
A SILLY, STUPID,
SOPHOMORIC CLOD.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.748
I LOVE YOU.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.501
STOP SAYING THAT. I--

10:38.179 --> 10:40.136

10:40.223 --> 10:42.214
ONE DRINK.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.430
FIVE MINUTES,
AND THEN YOU GO.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.229
I'VE GOT TO PUT

10:57.240 --> 11:00.483
IT'S LIKE...

11:00.577 --> 11:02.067

EXCELLENT CHAMPAGNE,

ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE HAD IT.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.324
ONE LAST
LITTLE KISS?

12:24.410 --> 12:27.994
ROGER, PLEASE, LET'S NOT
PROLONG THIS ANY LONGER.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.492

12:33.336 --> 12:35.748
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.875
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.877
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
YOU AT THE MOMENT.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.834
NOW PLEASE GO!

12:46.516 --> 12:50.054

12:57.986 --> 13:00.068

ALL MY STRENGTH.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.358
ROGER...

13:06.452 --> 13:10.787
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.740
PERHAPS I AM
BEING CRUEL.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.543
I DON'T MEAN TO BE.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.247
I KNOW.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.376
ROGER!

13:26.681 --> 13:31.141
LET ME--MAKE IT
A LITTLE NICER.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.149

14:12.602 --> 14:15.094
OH, I'M SORRY

14:20.026 --> 14:21.437
WELL, KNEEL
IN A CHAIR.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.645

14:26.282 --> 14:29.445
UH, ANY CHAIR,

14:32.288 --> 14:35.030
DARLING, DO YOU WANT
YOUR SLIPPERS NOW?

14:35.124 --> 14:38.116
NO, THEY MAKE
MY FEET HOT.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.001
OH, WELL, IF YOUR
FEET ARE HOT NOW

14:40.088 --> 14:42.329
I COULD SOAK MY
HANDS IN ICE WATER

14:42.423 --> 14:43.629
AND THEN CARESS THEM.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.959
NO, NO, MY FEET
ARE FINE.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.966
ALL RIGHT.

14:50.056 --> 14:54.220
DARLING, DON'T YOU WANT
TO SMOKE YOUR PIPE?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.392
NO, IT BITES
MY TONGUE.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.641
IT'S NOT BROKEN

14:58.689 --> 15:00.225
OH, WELL,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.148

15:02.235 --> 15:03.976
I COULD SMOKE IT ALL DAY
VVHILE YOU'RE AT THE OFFICE

15:04.028 --> 15:05.530

15:05.613 --> 15:09.982

PUT CIGARETTES

15:31.973 --> 15:34.510

16:13.264 --> 16:17.258

16:17.351 --> 16:18.887
DID I DISTURB YOU
BY ASKING YOU

16:18.978 --> 16:20.309

DISTURBING YOU?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.682
[impatiently]

16:32.909 --> 16:36.903
YOU'RE JUST PERFECT.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.455
I LOVE TO SAY
"I LOVE YOU."

16:40.541 --> 16:43.158
I LOVE TO LOVE YOU.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.505
LEILA, I'VE GOT

16:45.588 --> 16:47.829

16:47.924 --> 16:50.666

16:50.760 --> 16:53.627
DARLING... WILL YOU BE LONG?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.507
I DON'T KNOW.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.965

17:10.363 --> 17:11.397
<i>[laughs nervously]</i>

17:33.970 --> 17:35.631
UH...

17:35.721 --> 17:39.134
HI, THERE, PROFESSOR.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.471

EXPECTING YOU.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.144

17:44.230 --> 17:45.812
YES, I RATHER THOUGHT

17:45.898 --> 17:47.730
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR
HOW THINGS TURNED OUT.

17:47.817 --> 17:53.358
I KNOW HOW
THINGS TURNED OUT.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.575
THAT POTION SURE WORKS.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.820
I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.324
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOU?

18:02.373 --> 18:06.662
THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED
WITH ME IN YEARS.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.164
PRETTY UGLY SITUATION
WE'VE GOT...

18:09.213 --> 18:12.171
WITH CHINA,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.590
YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, EITHER.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.009
ME? OH, I'M
FINE, FINE.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.928
I JUST DROPPED
AROUND TO TELL YOU

18:19.015 --> 18:20.722
THAT THINGS

18:20.808 --> 18:26.770
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

18:26.856 --> 18:30.690
AH, GLOVE
CLEANER, HUH?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.767
SAY, DO YOU SELL
MUCH OF THAT STUFF?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.569
NOW AND AGAIN.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.521
BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S IN IT?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.527
NO TRACE, NO ODOR,
NO TASTE.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.533
NO WAY TO DETECT
ITS PRESENCE.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.655
AND IT'S SURE.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.871
$1,000.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.124
THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAME FOR, ISN'T IT?

18:52.214 --> 18:55.457
ME? NO, NOT AT ALL.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.212
PAINLESS?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.877
IT'S PERFECT
FOR ITS PURPOSE.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.887
THE ONLY THING OF ITS
KIND IN THE VVORLD.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.388
INTERESTING.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.762
SHE LOVES YOU AS I
SAID SHE VVOULD,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.217
DOESN'T SHE?

19:06.312 --> 19:07.643
A CONSTANT LOVE.
AND NOTHING YOU

19:07.730 --> 19:09.892
CAN DO TO HER
WILL CHANGE IT.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.647
SHE WORSHIPS
AND ADORES YOU

19:11.734 --> 19:13.395
AND HANGS ON
YOUR EVERY WORD.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.559
YES, YES, SHE DOES.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.144
$1,000.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.229
I AM GOING OUT
OF MY EVERLOVING MIND.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.655
I CAN'T STAND
IT ANYMORE!

19:19.742 --> 19:21.403
NATURALLY.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.737
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY WE
CAN QUIET IT DOWN?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.787
NO.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.410
ISN'T THERE SOME POTION THAT'LL
TRANSFER SOME OF THIS LOVE

19:28.501 --> 19:30.333
TO SOMEONE ELSE?
LIKE A COCKER SPANIEL?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.797
NOT A CHANCE.
SHE'S YOURS.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.247
SHE'S SO NICE TO ME.
SHE'S SO VERY GOOD.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.710
I KNOW.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.667
THE GLOVE CLEANER
IS THE ONLY WAY.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.093
WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT.

19:46.977 --> 19:51.517
UH, THERE MUST
BE ANOTHER WAY.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.689
THIS IS THE WAY.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.608
THE ONLY WAY.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.026
$1,000.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.478
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.108
ALL THE TIME--
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.195
I DO KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.741
HOW DO YOU THINK

20:04.829 --> 20:09.039
I CAME TO INVENT
THE GLOVE CLEANER?

20:09.125 --> 20:11.287
BUT THAT'S
ALL MY SAVINGS!

20:11.335 --> 20:15.545
I KNOW. IT'S
ALWAYS THAT WAY.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.713
NO TRACE, NO ODOR,
NO TASTE.

20:17.800 --> 20:22.044
NO WAY TO DETECT.

20:22.138 --> 20:27.508
ALL RIGHT.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.888
AH, ALL
MADE OUT, EH?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.845
ONE THING I MUST
CAUTION YOU ABOUT.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.146
YOU MUST USE IT
IMMEDIATELY, HEAR ME?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.474
AND YOU MUST
USE IT ALL.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.359
WHY, WILL IT SPOIL?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.902
NO, BUT YOU WILL.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.526
ONCE YOU DELAY,
YOU'RE LOST.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.744
IF YOU FAIL THE FIRST
TIME YOU TRY TO USE IT

20:44.827 --> 20:48.161
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE COURAGE
TO USE IT AGAIN. NEVER.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.661
GOODBYE, PROFESSOR.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.784
FAREWELL.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.250
ALWAYS THE SAME WAY.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.253

21:01.343 --> 21:03.505
THEN THE CHASER.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.855

AFTER ALL, IT ISN'T EVERYBODY
THAT'S BEEN MARRIED

21:18.903 --> 21:20.268
SIX MONTHS

21:20.362 --> 21:22.103

21:27.411 --> 21:30.745
GLASSES. CAN'T HAVE A
PARTY VVITHOUT GLASSES.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.538
IT'S JUST LIKE
THE FIRST TIME.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.957

21:59.985 --> 22:04.855
OH, DARLING, IT'S SO VVONDERFUL
BEING MARRIED TO YOU.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.281
<i>I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO COMPLETELY HAPPY</i>

22:07.368 --> 22:09.575
<i>IN MY WHOLE LIFE.</i>

22:09.662 --> 22:12.404
<i>I'VE LIVED JUST

22:12.456 --> 22:13.366
<i>ONLY YOU.</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:15.118
THAT'S NICE.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.578
SWEETEST, HOW
DID YOU HAPPEN

22:19.672 --> 22:21.333
TO THINK
OF THE CHAMPAGNE?

22:21.423 --> 22:22.879
IT JUST CAME
TO ME.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.967
I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME

22:26.053 --> 22:27.635
YOU BROUGHT
ME CHAMPAGNE--

22:27.721 --> 22:30.099
HOW YOU LOOKED.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.674
YOUR EYES WERE
FILLED WITH LOVE.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.180
AND YOU WATCHED ME
DRINK, AND SO SADLY

22:35.271 --> 22:37.262
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO BE

22:37.356 --> 22:39.768
