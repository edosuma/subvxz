WEBVTT

00:18.083 --> 00:20.041
Okay, Hannah.
Hands on the rails.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.333
One, two, three!
(CLAPS) Up!

00:22.834 --> 00:23.917
Okay, that's not bad.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.333
-Who's making you surf?
-My job.

00:27.333 --> 00:28.583
You're a professional surfer?

00:28.917 --> 00:30.708
HANNAH: No, I'm a writer here
on assignment,

00:30.708 --> 00:31.834
writing about surfing.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.917
MARNIE: I can't have you
sleeping in my place anymore.

00:33.917 --> 00:34.917
Are you asking me to move out?

00:34.917 --> 00:35.875
This is not about him.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.125
I'm going through a divorce...
Slow it down.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.959
You'd probably have fun
in surf camp,

00:39.959 --> 00:41.208
if you just let yourself.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.083
Woo!

00:42.417 --> 00:43.875
God, I was so ready
to hate this...

00:44.125 --> 00:46.500
So much easier to love something
if you hate it, don't you think?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.000
Love's the easiest thing
in the world.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.583
Why are we even fighting?

00:49.792 --> 00:50.959
We should be putting this
into the music!

00:50.959 --> 00:51.959
We are not Fleetwood Mac.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.166
You should wanna be
Fleetwood Mac.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.959
Before I even saw you
as a woman,

00:56.291 --> 00:57.625
I saw you as an artist.

01:08.458 --> 01:10.708
( moaning )
Yes! Harder!

01:10.708 --> 01:12.959
( both panting )

01:14.875 --> 01:19.000
( loud grunting )

01:19.000 --> 01:20.667
I am disgusting!

01:20.667 --> 01:22.583
- I'm fucking disgusting!
- No, no, no.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.333
Don't do that, Marnie.
Don't do that to yourself.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.458
No, no, no.

01:26.458 --> 01:28.000
I'm worse
than my father.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.500
I'm a fucking
monster.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.667
Hey, if you don't believe
in your own goodness,

01:31.667 --> 01:34.208
you can't expect
anybody else to,
you know?

01:34.208 --> 01:35.667
Do you?

01:35.667 --> 01:37.834
Do you believe
in my goodness?

01:40.625 --> 01:43.000
- You came?
- Yeah.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.125
I didn't come.
I'm still hard.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.959
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.208
( Desi moans )

01:55.542 --> 01:57.750
I don't feel...
as though...

01:57.750 --> 01:59.083
I'm going to.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.834
I don't feel, either,
that you are going to.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.917
( groans )

02:08.917 --> 02:12.208
( Desi groaning )

02:12.208 --> 02:14.208
( bed squeaking )

02:14.208 --> 02:16.708
So, Marnie's
been fucking Desi
for a full two weeks.

02:16.708 --> 02:19.959
Ray has no idea and thinks
he's just in a regular
in-love couple.

02:19.959 --> 02:23.208
And Marnie says that Desi cries
every time they say hello
or goodbye to each other,

02:23.208 --> 02:26.208
and now she and Desi
are seriously considering
trying anal.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.125
He's not getting anything
up Marnie's ass.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.083
- The whole thing
is just so intense.
- For who?

02:31.083 --> 02:34.708
By the way, me telling
you this does not make me
a bad secret-keeper.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.458
Okay? You and I have
a sacred bond,

02:36.458 --> 02:38.208
like that of husband
and wife,

02:38.208 --> 02:40.500
where you can say anything
in a sacred space.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.375
I'm a great
secret-keeper.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.583
Well, A,
no, you're not.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.834
And, B, I would never,
ever tell this secret.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.750
- Yeah.
- I've already
forgotten it.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.750
It's so boring
and it has nothing
to do with me,

02:51.750 --> 02:53.917
- so why would I care?
- Absolutely.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.625
Oh, please remember
to pack bug spray.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.000
I don't want to have
to put calamine lotion

02:57.000 --> 02:58.959
on your tender bits
again.

02:58.959 --> 03:00.583
Already rubbed it
in every crack.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.125
- Good girl!
- Full-scale adult.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.625
Oh!

03:03.625 --> 03:05.750
I just can't believe
Marnie roped me into this.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.959
You think I have time,
with my burgeoning career,

03:07.959 --> 03:11.000
to go to Poughkeepsie
to support her, like,
sick little tryst?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.708
Ugh, yeah,
'cause nothing says,

03:12.708 --> 03:14.583
"Let's get this
romance back on track"
like Poughkeepsie.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.834
- ( groans )
- Just tell her
you don't want to go.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.166
I can't tell her
I don't want to go.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.750
I'm already
a part of her lie.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.750
Hey, you're a part
of her lie whether
you go or not.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.417
Yeah, but how am I gonna
look into the eye

03:24.417 --> 03:26.417
of my friend Ray and say,
"Oh, upstate was great,"

03:26.417 --> 03:29.625
when really I was
just in this apartment,
eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos,

03:29.625 --> 03:32.458
working on my article
about Staten Island's
last remaining sex cult.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.125
Ugh, which I am
so excited about.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.542
I'm so proud of you
really cracking that case.

03:37.542 --> 03:40.458
Thank you. It's such
a beautiful facility
that they live in,

03:40.458 --> 03:42.000
and all you have to do
is sign over

03:42.000 --> 03:43.417
everything
you've ever owned.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.959
What are you gonna do
while I'm gone?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.917
Actually,
I have to hang out
with Shoshanna tonight.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.542
You're gonna hang out
with Shoshanna alone?

03:48.542 --> 03:49.875
I know,
it's so strange,

03:49.875 --> 03:51.542
but she called me
and she was like,

03:51.542 --> 03:53.708
"I have to go to this
'Women in Business' mixer

03:53.708 --> 03:56.041
and I'm so terrified
because I'm so socially
awkward

03:56.041 --> 03:57.375
and I seem like
a crazy person,

03:57.375 --> 03:58.959
and maybe I have
an Adderall addiction

03:58.959 --> 04:01.000
and you please
have to help me
and I'm so hungry.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.375
And please help me.
Please! Please!"

04:02.375 --> 04:04.000
And I was like,
"Stop talking!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.625
Where'd you
get this number?

04:05.625 --> 04:07.291
I'll go with you
if you shut up.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.875
Let's make sure
there's an open bar

04:08.875 --> 04:10.792
and hopefully the woman
who invented Spanx
will be there

04:10.792 --> 04:12.667
because I have a lot
to thank her for."

05:04.208 --> 05:06.291
- Hi, Grandma!
- Hi!

05:06.291 --> 05:08.542
Happy birthday!

05:08.542 --> 05:11.708
Ninety-seven--
that is a... big one,

05:11.708 --> 05:13.625
and, um,
you really did it.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.875
You're still
under 100 pounds,
so... kudos!

05:16.875 --> 05:21.041
And I-- I hope there's
no elder abuse at the, um--

05:21.041 --> 05:22.625
at the home
that you're in,

05:22.625 --> 05:25.041
and I hope that
you're using protection

05:25.041 --> 05:26.208
for the sex.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.542
Anyway, we miss you.
I love you.

05:28.542 --> 05:29.792
We love you!

05:29.792 --> 05:31.125
Um, and bye!

05:31.125 --> 05:32.834
Happy birthday!

05:34.500 --> 05:36.166
That was great!
That was good.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.875
Um, I don't think
I'm going to send that.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.208
That was, um,

05:40.208 --> 05:42.333
super depressing
and totally inappropriate.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.125
Yeah, actually,
speaking of which,

05:44.125 --> 05:45.750
I need to go.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.667
It's my first week
at a new job

05:47.667 --> 05:51.000
and this wasn't
a super convenient
time for me, so.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.583
Right! Oh, yeah,
your job.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.583
Your-- you work
in a market, right?

05:55.583 --> 05:57.458
Marketing.
I work in marketing.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.750
- That's what I said.
- So different.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.542
I'm a junior associate
at Silver Horn, New York's
hippest branding agency.

06:03.542 --> 06:06.125
- Mm.
- So, I have
a real schedule now.

06:06.125 --> 06:09.375
So I'm happy to share
my Google Cal with you

06:09.375 --> 06:10.959
if you want to make
actual plans.

06:10.959 --> 06:13.166
And what are you
doing?

06:13.166 --> 06:16.458
Tonight?
Um, yeah, I--
I have plans.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.083
Oh.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.500
With-- with Elijah.
I have plans--

06:20.500 --> 06:22.417
we're just--
we're going to a thing.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.166
Okay, what kind
of a thing?

06:24.166 --> 06:27.041
Um, just a thing.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.959
It's just a thing

06:28.959 --> 06:31.625
for, uh,
professional women.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.667
Um, it's a networking
thingy,

06:35.667 --> 06:37.667
and it's totally
not your crowd.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.959
You would really,
um, hate it.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.458
Not my crowd?

06:41.458 --> 06:42.750
Mm-hmm.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.083
Professional women
are my exact crowd.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.375
Just tell me the address

06:47.375 --> 06:50.083
and whether I should wear
shoulder pads or not.

06:52.708 --> 06:57.792
It feels so great
to be on the town
with my girls.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.875
I'm not your girl,
okay?

06:59.875 --> 07:01.166
Okay, with my women.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.875
With my women.
I stand corrected.

07:02.875 --> 07:06.041
Hannah, if you were
gonna be such a bitch,
why did you even come?

07:06.041 --> 07:08.583
Oh, I don't know,
'cause I was trying
to protect you

07:08.583 --> 07:11.333
and your house of lies,
you fucking morons.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.458
Fuck!
God damn it!

07:16.458 --> 07:17.834
Woman:
Oh, just leave it.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.000
Just leave it.
It's fine.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.834
I need to reorganize
that anyway.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.500
Just kick 'em aside.
It's fine.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.000
I'll get to it later.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.667
Wow.

07:26.917 --> 07:30.250
I have never felt
such an intense need

07:30.250 --> 07:32.625
to just, like,
Instagram a stranger.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.166
I get that a lot.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.667
You know,
no one's expecting
all of this

07:36.667 --> 07:38.125
in all of this.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.500
No, they don't.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.750
Look, I'm gonna be in the back
if you have any questions.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.041
Look around and explore.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.291
I do have
one question,

07:49.291 --> 07:52.917
which is why are you not,
like, a model in Dubai?

07:52.917 --> 07:55.875
You could be making, like,
$10 million a year.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.375
Well, do you want
the short version

07:58.375 --> 08:00.417
or the hero's journey?

08:00.417 --> 08:03.458
I think the short version.
The short version's fine.

08:03.458 --> 08:06.792
Well, I was working
in the city,

08:06.792 --> 08:09.083
- in fashion...
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.083 --> 08:12.667
...living in
a matchbook-sized
flat in Queens.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.875
I feel you.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.041
I had blinding migraines
three times a week.

08:16.041 --> 08:19.542
I couldn't even afford
new undergarments.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.667
Finally, one day,
I fainted.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.917
Fell right onto
the tracks.

08:24.917 --> 08:28.166
Unconscious,
possibly dead.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.125
When I woke up...

08:30.125 --> 08:31.250
( laughs )

08:31.250 --> 08:33.792
...Chris Noth
fished me out.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.332
Like "Law & Order"'s
own Chris Noth?

08:36.332 --> 08:37.875
Hmm!

08:37.875 --> 08:39.582
I hit the third rail.

08:39.582 --> 08:42.667
I'm the first person
to survive the third rail.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.500
- Isn't that crazy?
- The third rail?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
- That's, like,
a lot of volts.
- Yeah.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.208
But I totally
believe you.
I'm just--

08:48.208 --> 08:50.542
No, it's-- it's--
it's real.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.250
So, I was like,
"Thank you, Chris Noth,

08:52.250 --> 08:53.792
for fishing me out
and saving my life.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.792
I'm getting the fuck
out of here forever."

08:55.792 --> 08:57.583
The end.
That's my story.

08:58.708 --> 09:00.583
And you live here now?

09:00.583 --> 09:01.750
Mm-hmm.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.291
Are you happier, or...?

09:03.291 --> 09:05.041
How could I not be?

09:05.041 --> 09:06.959
I'm living my truth.

09:06.959 --> 09:08.250
Right?

09:10.125 --> 09:12.125
How much is that
tea set in the window?

09:12.125 --> 09:14.125
It's so beautiful.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.625
Mm. For you?

09:17.875 --> 09:18.959
Free.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.417
What?

09:22.417 --> 09:25.250
Thanks to my accident,

09:25.250 --> 09:26.875
I'm quite the psychic,

09:26.875 --> 09:31.291
and I can tell when a woman
needs a new tea set.

09:31.291 --> 09:34.625
In fact, I can tell
when her life depends on it.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.917
This is all getting,
like, very "Teen Witchy."

09:38.917 --> 09:41.917
Like when she
goes into that store
and gets the amulet, it...

09:46.125 --> 09:48.500
I don't know how
I'll ever thank you.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.291
Like, it's so amazing.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.625
I'm gonna have to learn
to boil water now.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.500
That'll help.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.166
By the way,
that's my best friend.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.875
She's stuck in this, like,
psychosexual hamster wheel

09:57.875 --> 09:59.834
with this
total fuck nugget, so.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.542
What-- what--
what is going on?

10:02.542 --> 10:04.583
You were
looking at the girl
in the yogurt place.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.166
I saw.
You were
staring at her!

10:06.166 --> 10:07.667
- But she looked unwell!
- Are you serious?

10:07.667 --> 10:10.000
I was concerned about her.
I was really worried.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.792
Oh, my God,
you're so compassionate.

10:12.792 --> 10:15.166
- I was really scared.
- I know, I know, I know.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.333
Oh, stop it!
Not that in public!

10:17.333 --> 10:19.000
Stop it!

Hannah, how many

11:26.708 --> 11:29.583
There's got to be

11:30.834 --> 11:32.917
Hey, what's going on?

11:32.917 --> 11:34.875
I have feelings,
you know.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.542
I feel guilty
about Ray.

11:36.542 --> 11:39.417
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.917
But, you know,
we're all just trying
to do what we can to live.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.750
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.083

11:49.667 --> 11:51.333
Okay, I'm kind of
freaking out.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.542
I mean, like, the hosts
are Rachel and Zeva.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.125
Who are they again?

11:56.125 --> 11:58.583
They were my best friends
freshman and sophomore year

11:58.583 --> 12:01.333
until I made the fatal mistake
of deciding to push them aside
for Jessa when she came home,

12:01.333 --> 12:03.458
because for some reason
I thought that her friends
were, like,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.667
the apex of maturity,
which is ridiculous,
and I recognize that now.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.250
And now Rachel and Zeva
own Jamba Jeans.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.792
- Whoa, Jamba Jeans.
- I know.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.375
We can't all
be perfect, okay?

12:13.375 --> 12:15.250
Everyone has
their own path.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.875

12:39.500 --> 12:41.375
I literally
have nothing else.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.708
So, this is it?

12:42.708 --> 12:45.166
New York's best
and brightest "WEMUN"?

12:45.166 --> 12:46.792
A whole lot of pleather,
considering.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.125
It's "women."

12:48.125 --> 12:50.417
- Where's my name tag?
- Ugh! No.

12:50.417 --> 12:53.083

- Ooh, Jana.

hoping that you had
fallen asleep.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.166
Can I be
Jana Daniels?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.375
Hey, ladies.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.417
Sorry to interrupt
what is surely

13:01.417 --> 13:04.208
a maelstrom
of fascinating
conversation.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.000
- ( music fades )
- I'm Rachel DeTapley.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.125
And I'm Zeva Carondelet.

13:08.125 --> 13:12.875
We're the co-CEOs
and creative directors
of Jamba Jeans.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.333
And now we've
founded WEMUN:

13:20.333 --> 13:23.083
"Women Entrepreneurs
Meet Up Now."

13:23.083 --> 13:26.208
Honestly,
we just wanted to give
back to the community

13:26.208 --> 13:28.667
of New York
female entrepreneurs

13:28.667 --> 13:32.333
and give you
amazing businesswomen
a chance to connect

13:32.333 --> 13:35.667
and talk about
how to synergize
and mobilize.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.500
Zeva:
We're all strong,
like-minded women,

13:38.500 --> 13:41.667
so let's crack open
our brains and really
get into it.

13:41.667 --> 13:45.000
Yes. Whether it's
how to rock a romper
at a work event,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.792
or who you should be
voting for,

13:46.792 --> 13:49.041
a WEMUN woman
is the person to ask.

13:49.041 --> 13:52.208
Also, for those of you
asking on our Facebook

13:52.208 --> 13:54.417
if the group is open
to trans women,

13:54.417 --> 13:56.750
the answer is:
we don't know, okay?

13:56.750 --> 14:00.625
So, go forth and mingle
and make connections

14:00.625 --> 14:03.083
that will catapult you
to the next level.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

14:05.500 --> 14:07.750
( music resumes )

14:07.750 --> 14:09.208
Whoo!

14:09.208 --> 14:10.917
Zeva:
It's like Beyoncé
up in here.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.834
Rachel, Zeva, hi!

14:12.834 --> 14:16.500
Shoshanna!
Seriously,
this is too much.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.375
We haven't seen you
in an eternity.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.500
An eternity.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.667
I know, an eternity.
Totes.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.083
This is my
executive assistant,

14:24.083 --> 14:25.083
Elijah.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.667
At your service.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.417
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:29.417 --> 14:33.083
Um, and this
is my cousin, Jessa.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.500
Yeah, no, we remember.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.583
Hi.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.041
I love your, um--
your party.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.667
And the best
pigs-in-blankets
in the tristate area.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.875
Did you try them?
Amazing.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.375
Thanks.
It's sort of doubling
as a celebration.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.625
It's the two-year anniversary
of our business.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.959
- Right.
- Rachel: I can't believe
it's been two years.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.375
- I worship us.
- I know.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.583
Both:
Clink.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.500
Jamba Jeans.
Seriously, amazing.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.959
Amazing.
You guys literally
cracked open the market

15:00.959 --> 15:02.875
on athletic denim,
and I am--

15:02.875 --> 15:05.792
I'm just so happy for you.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.375
Oh, thanks so much.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.792
Honestly, it's been
such a wild ride.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.083
We're expanding
into T-shirts right now,

15:12.083 --> 15:15.375
and it's such a mindfuck
to be moving beyond denim.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.750
So, what are you
doing right now?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.750
I just started a job
in branding at Silver Horn.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.125
- Oh.
- Oh, amazing.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.834
Hell, yes.
With Mathias
and Marina?

15:23.834 --> 15:25.708
- Yeah. Love them.
- Zeva: Love them.

15:25.708 --> 15:27.542
They're total visionaries,
floor to ceiling.

15:27.542 --> 15:30.417
Like, basically,
they do nothing
and achieve everything,

15:30.417 --> 15:32.291
and I'm all about that.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.542
Rachel:
And their Snapchat stories
are, like, super avant-garde.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.166
Shoshanna: Oh, my God, totes.
I've been pitching them
all the snaps,

15:37.166 --> 15:38.959
and they've been like,
"Let's chat that."

15:38.959 --> 15:41.333
- And I'm like, "Yeah."
- Rachel: That's great.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.625
- ( mouthing words )
- Shoshanna: Yeah, but it's been
a great place to work so far,

15:43.625 --> 15:45.625
and I'm really loving it.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.542
I feel very lucky,
but I'm definitely looking
to be self-employed

15:48.542 --> 15:50.333
in the next, like,
16-20 months.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.708
( acoustic guitar playing )

15:59.375 --> 16:01.917
( music continues )

16:10.166 --> 16:11.375
Des.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.875
Desi, what are these?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.458
Marnie, that is
my private briefcase.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.166
Come on.
How dare you?

16:21.166 --> 16:23.625
Briefcase?
All that's in here
is a jar of pills

16:23.625 --> 16:24.917
and a loose pencil.

16:24.917 --> 16:28.125
What the fuck
are these?

16:28.125 --> 16:30.750
Those are my mints.
Just-- whatever.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.959
Put them back.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.750
These are mints?

16:33.750 --> 16:35.000
They're...

16:36.291 --> 16:37.959
They're just
some mints, okay?

16:37.959 --> 16:40.250
Just--
let's put 'em back.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.583
Oh, so you just
collect mints from places

16:43.583 --> 16:46.250
and keep them
in a mason jar.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.250
Actually, no, Marnie.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.291
They're Oxy.
Is that what
you want to hear?

16:51.291 --> 16:54.208
Is that what you wanna hear?
They're Oxy-fucking-Contin.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.708
And I've been on them
for a fucking year!

16:57.708 --> 16:59.500
And I'm addicted to them,
so please put

16:59.500 --> 17:01.750
my fucking OxyContin
in my jar,

17:01.750 --> 17:04.083
back in my private
fucking briefcase.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.541
Okay, Marnie?

17:05.541 --> 17:07.583
Wait, are you
fucking serious?

17:07.583 --> 17:08.834
Oh, yeah.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.333
You've been taking it
for a year?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.834
Oh, yeah!

17:11.834 --> 17:13.250
You were high
at our wedding.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.959
I thought you seemed
sleepy and itchy.

17:14.959 --> 17:17.625
You were fucking high
at our wedding!

17:17.625 --> 17:19.290
Oh, fuck, yeah!

17:19.290 --> 17:21.083
- Put 'em back!
- No!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.208
( glass shatters )

17:22.208 --> 17:23.959
- Oh, my fucking God!
- No!

17:23.959 --> 17:25.750
- You are not
gonna get these!
- Oh, my God!

17:25.750 --> 17:28.000
I'm stomping them out!
You are not gonna
get these.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.500
- Fucking bitch!
- I'm gonna stomp them out!

17:30.500 --> 17:33.375
- I'm stomping them out!
- Stop! Stop!

17:33.375 --> 17:35.166
- You are not gonna get these!
- Ow! Fuck!

17:35.166 --> 17:36.875
You are not--
don't you dare!

17:36.875 --> 17:39.250
Stop, you motherfuck--
( snorting )

17:39.250 --> 17:40.834
What the fuck?

17:40.834 --> 17:42.333
You are this sick junkie...

17:42.333 --> 17:44.083
- ( bones crunch )
- Ow! God!

17:44.083 --> 17:47.083
That fucking hurt!
Jesus! Yeah, I am sick!

17:47.083 --> 17:49.875
I'm fucked up!
I'm fucking sick!

17:49.875 --> 17:52.458
But you're fucking demented.
Who doesn't know that
their husband's

17:52.458 --> 17:54.291
on 20 fucking Oxy a day?

17:54.291 --> 17:56.708
Twenty Oxy a day
and you abandoned me!

17:56.708 --> 17:58.458
My whole life
is a cry for help!

17:58.458 --> 18:00.250
Fucking hate
this nonsense!

18:00.250 --> 18:02.625
- No! Get out!
- No, I'm not doing this
with you right now.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.250
Get out!
Hannah, come help!

18:04.250 --> 18:06.125
- I'm not doing this.
No way, Marnie.
- Get out!

18:06.125 --> 18:09.625
- Just stop this.
- Hannah, you dumb slut,
get down here!

18:09.625 --> 18:12.500
- Desi: Hannah,
everything is fine!
- Marnie: It's not fine!

18:12.500 --> 18:15.542
- Just be quiet. Marnie--
- Hannah!

18:15.542 --> 18:17.083
- Hannah, go back upstairs.
- Oh, my God, stop it!

18:17.083 --> 18:18.750
- Go back upstairs!
- Stop it!

18:18.750 --> 18:20.834
- Get out of here.
- You're grabbing her
too much.

18:20.834 --> 18:23.291
- Just horsing around.
- We're gonna just
walk out gently.

18:23.291 --> 18:26.542
- You're being very violent
and inappropriate!
- No, no, no, I'm not.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.458
I'm all about--
hey, I'm all about peace.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.291
Okay, this is not
necessary.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.917
- Get out of this house.
- Ow!

18:31.917 --> 18:33.333
Get out of this house.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.583
What is the meaning
of this fucking
cunt parade?

18:35.583 --> 18:39.583
- Okay.
- Okay, why don't you two
just go fuck each other?

18:39.583 --> 18:41.000
( door slams )

18:41.000 --> 18:42.834
Okay!

18:45.333 --> 18:46.834
Hi, Hannah.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.208
- ( screams )
- Marnie: No!

18:48.208 --> 18:50.583
- Marnie! Marnie!
Get him out!
- No!

18:50.583 --> 18:52.542
- No! No!
- Hey, Marnie,
I'm sorry, baby.

18:52.542 --> 18:55.166
- No! No! No! Get out.
- It's a misunderstanding.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.333
- I'm sorry.
- Get it out!

18:56.333 --> 18:58.959
- Get it out!
- Okay, okay.

18:58.959 --> 19:02.250
This is shocking, okay?

19:02.250 --> 19:04.208
That is not
who I thought
that person was.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.125
- ( screaming )
- Bitches and cunts!

19:13.125 --> 19:16.375
Bitches and cunts!
Bitches and cunts!

19:16.375 --> 19:18.083
- Bitches and cunts!
- No!

19:18.083 --> 19:19.917
- Let me in! Let me in!
- Marnie: Get out!

19:19.917 --> 19:21.500
- Bitches and cunts!
- Get the fuck away!

19:21.500 --> 19:23.542
- Cunt!
- No! Oh!

19:23.542 --> 19:25.000
What the fuck?!

19:25.000 --> 19:27.166
Shoshanna:
Seriously,
seeing you was like

19:27.166 --> 19:30.166
an emotional facelift,
so we need to hang out.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.333
Who should I give
my new digits to?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.917
Honestly,
Shoshanna,

19:34.917 --> 19:37.208
I don't know,
'cause you really--

19:37.208 --> 19:39.250
You really hurt us
when you bailed.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.166
I mean, canceling
on Spring Break,

19:41.166 --> 19:43.708
- like, six hours before?
- Rachel: It was so rude.

19:43.708 --> 19:46.250
Zeva:
We ended up having to take
that trip to Aruba alone.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.583
And in a way,
it was amazing,

19:48.583 --> 19:50.375
because that's when
Jamba Jeans was born.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.750
But we had to
split that room two ways
instead of three ways,

19:53.750 --> 19:56.083
and we just felt
so rejected and...

19:56.083 --> 19:57.583
- Rachel:
It was just so rude.
- ...like, awful.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.500
Rachel:
It hurt so much.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
However, we just can't
trust you to re-enter
our lives right now

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
'cause we've got
a lot going on.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.417
But we really do
wish you the best,
though.

20:14.542 --> 20:15.583
Shoshanna.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.417
Shosh.
Shosh!

20:18.417 --> 20:19.959
First of all,
I can't believe

20:19.959 --> 20:21.625
that you ever hung out
with those girls.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.125
They're awful.
They're like

20:23.125 --> 20:25.792
Khloe Kardashian
and Bethenny Frankel...

20:25.792 --> 20:28.792
if those women
weren't amazing and
total revolutionaries.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.875
Can you shut up?
Can we please just
get out of here?

20:31.875 --> 20:34.000
( crying )

20:36.959 --> 20:39.583
How did I get here?

20:39.583 --> 20:43.125
Like, this was just
supposed to be, like,
a fun little jaunt.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.458
- You know?
- I don't think
you should say "jaunt."

20:45.458 --> 20:47.458
That's not a good
expression to use.

20:47.458 --> 20:50.625
No, I mean,
like, how the fuck
did I end up here?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.750
I'm on a trip
with my ex-husband,

20:53.750 --> 20:55.500
who I didn't know
was a drug addict,

20:55.500 --> 20:58.750
which is the second time
that's happened to me,
by the way.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.834
You are so bad
at knowing when
people are high.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.166
Do you remember that time
I drank sizzurp

21:02.166 --> 21:03.875
and you thought
I had senioritis?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.708
( laughs )

21:05.708 --> 21:08.667
But seriously, Marnie,
it can be pretty hard
to have...

21:08.667 --> 21:10.000
observations
about other people

21:10.000 --> 21:11.458
when you're only
thinking about yourself.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.959
I would know.

21:19.166 --> 21:20.959
And I'm not
judging you, okay?

21:20.959 --> 21:23.041
I promise.
I'm done with that.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.083
I'm done judging.
I'm done being superior.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.667
I'm done acting like
I know anything at all.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.291
None of us know
fucking anything.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.000
We don't know shit,
do we?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.291
Nope.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.417
Well, I need
to ask you something.

21:35.417 --> 21:37.041
Yeah?

21:37.041 --> 21:40.250
Do you promise
that we'll always
be friends?

21:41.708 --> 21:43.542
You think I'm gonna stop
being your friend now?

21:43.542 --> 21:45.875
After putting up
with all this bullshit?

21:45.875 --> 21:48.875
- You've put up with
a lot of bullshit, too.
- Yeah, I know.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.959
And I'm gonna help you
get out of this situation.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.708
We're gonna get out
of this bed you made.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.834
All I need
is for you to actually
look at yourself.

21:55.834 --> 21:59.166
Look around at situations
in, like, a real way.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.542
( pounding on door )

22:00.542 --> 22:02.333
Desi:
All right,
you fucking babies!

22:02.333 --> 22:04.125
( pounds )
Fucking let me in
or I'm--

22:04.125 --> 22:05.708
I'm coming down
the goddamn chimney!

22:05.708 --> 22:07.834
You hear?
Like fucking Santa Claus!

22:07.834 --> 22:09.750
You hear me?
I'm gonna goddamn
fuckin' do it.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.125
I'm gonna spread
Santa's shit all over

22:12.125 --> 22:13.708
this motherfucking
pussy party!

22:13.708 --> 22:17.083
Can we just
give him his pills?
I mean, honestly.

22:17.083 --> 22:20.208
He looks like
someone in, like,
the Pacific Northwest

22:20.208 --> 22:21.917
knit a man.

22:21.917 --> 22:23.917
Jessa:
Here's what
I don't understand.

22:23.917 --> 22:27.208
Why aren't more
of these women going
into more practical trades,

22:27.208 --> 22:30.250
like being a cobbler
or a locksmith?

22:30.250 --> 22:32.583
At some point we need
lady road pavers,

22:32.583 --> 22:35.250
lady electricians,
lady plumbers!

22:35.250 --> 22:40.291
Can't I just go do
one line of coke without
you two running off?

22:40.291 --> 22:42.083
Here, do you
want one?

22:42.083 --> 22:45.750
Wait, you stole
an actual plate
from the WEMUN mixer?

22:45.750 --> 22:47.959
Well, congrats,
now you're even
more of a dick.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.750
I'm a dick?
Why am I a dick?

22:49.750 --> 22:53.083
Because I actually
came here to try to help
our tiny little friend here.

22:53.083 --> 22:56.000
All right?
Not steal fine china.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.208
( grunts )

22:57.208 --> 22:59.917
Or someone else's
fucking boyfriend.

23:03.959 --> 23:05.500
I can't believe
you just said that.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.959
I did.

23:06.959 --> 23:09.041
Fuck.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.959
You don't even
like Adam.

23:10.959 --> 23:12.792
How are you mad
at me about Adam?

23:12.792 --> 23:14.834
You wouldn't even
let him drink milk
from your fridge.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.291
Well, that's because
he has oral herpes.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.291
No, he doesn't.
That is a rumor!

23:18.291 --> 23:20.375
Elijah: Yes, he does.
You just have not been
with him long enough

23:20.375 --> 23:21.875
to witness
one of his outbreaks,

23:21.875 --> 23:23.542
so good luck
with that, okay?

23:23.542 --> 23:25.708
Shoshanna, can we
just get a cab, please?

23:25.708 --> 23:27.667
Can we just get cab?
Where are the cabs?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.291
You're not
coming in our cab.

23:30.917 --> 23:32.917
What the fuck
is going on?

23:32.917 --> 23:35.792
Why are you guys
both mad at me about Adam?

23:35.792 --> 23:37.959
I mean, fucking--
you know what?

23:37.959 --> 23:39.166
Marnie's fucking Ray
right now

23:39.166 --> 23:40.667
and no one seems
to give a shit.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.750
No, no, no.
She's actually fucking
Desi right now.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.000
- What?
- Ah.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.834
You know what?
I don't even care.

23:48.041 --> 23:49.875
I don't give a shit
about Adam, okay?

23:49.875 --> 23:52.500
But if you are using Marnie
to justify your behavior,

23:52.500 --> 23:54.291
then ew!

23:54.291 --> 23:55.834
Seriously,

23:55.834 --> 23:59.166
you ruined my relationship
with Rachel and Zeva.

23:59.166 --> 24:01.667
You-- you ruined
my life!

24:01.667 --> 24:03.708
I could have been
a part of Jamba Jeans.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.708
I could have gone on
fancy trips and had people
who cared about me,

24:06.708 --> 24:09.792
and instead,
you convince me to go
to Rockaway for the day

24:09.792 --> 24:13.208
to get Italian ices,
because Vincent Gallo
might be there.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.417
Well, you know what?
Vincent Gallo wasn't
fucking there.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.750
And now I'm never
gonna see Aruba!

24:18.750 --> 24:20.708
You didn't even want
to go to Aruba.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.959
No one wants
to go to Aruba.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.708
Everyone wants
to go to Aruba!

24:24.708 --> 24:26.583
The only reason
you want to go
to Aruba now

24:26.583 --> 24:29.875
is because those girls
started, like, a stupid
jeans company.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.291
You're being
a star-fucker.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.875
You're being worse.
You're being a jeans-fucker.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.792
Get out of my face.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.834
Get out of my face!

24:40.083 --> 24:43.208
Get out of my face!

24:43.208 --> 24:47.583
Just because we are related
does not mean that you
get to be in my face!

24:47.583 --> 24:49.375
Yeah, get out
of her face!

24:52.959 --> 24:54.041
Grow up!

24:55.708 --> 24:57.834
Grow up!

24:57.834 --> 24:59.333
Now I have nothing!

25:01.708 --> 25:04.083
Who the fuck are you
to say "grow up"?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.250
Huh? I'm grown up.

25:06.250 --> 25:09.125
I am a grown-up.
I am a fucking grown-up!

25:09.125 --> 25:11.583

say that to me?

28:40.917 --> 28:43.667
and considered piece of writing
on what is ultimately hearsay?

28:43.667 --> 28:46.583
I don't consider the accounts of
four different women "hearsay."

I'm not perfect, I've told women
I've loved them,

That's what friends do."

29:28.625 --> 29:29.959
And then she complains
about it a lot.

29:30.208 --> 29:31.708
And tells everyone about it
when Marnie asked for it

29:31.708 --> 29:32.667
-to be a secret.
-Right.

29:32.959 --> 29:34.667
-I'm a great secret-keeper.
-Well...

29:34.667 --> 29:38.041
A, no, you're not. And B,
I've already forgotten it.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.166
It's so boring, and it has
nothing to do with me,

29:40.166 --> 29:41.375
so why would I care?

29:41.667 --> 29:43.000
Hey, ladies!

29:44.000 --> 29:47.125
We're the co-CEOs
of Jamba Jeans!

29:47.125 --> 29:49.000
Murray Miller's the genius
who decided that

29:49.000 --> 29:51.166
their denim company
was called "Jamba Jeans."

29:51.166 --> 29:52.041
(LAUGHS)

29:52.708 --> 29:54.375
It's almost like they were
just like, "We love Jamba Juice,

29:54.375 --> 29:55.417
-and we love jeans."
-(LAUGHS) Yeah.

29:56.208 --> 29:59.291
DUNHAM: I really loved WEMUN.
And it was so fun to think about

29:59.291 --> 30:02.041
what would Shoshanna's idea
of, like, utopia be.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.041
JENNI KONNER: Right.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.333
LENA DUNHAM: Shoshanna's
starting to find and define

30:05.333 --> 30:06.333
her own boundaries.

30:06.959 --> 30:10.041
And her irritation
with all of them is mounting.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.250
Can't I just go do
one line of coke

30:12.250 --> 30:13.625
without you two running off?

30:13.875 --> 30:16.625
In this episode, the immaturity
of Jessa's behavior,

30:16.625 --> 30:19.208
and the way that Jessa's
actually compromised her life

30:19.208 --> 30:21.208
really dawns on her,
and it's super painful.

30:21.875 --> 30:25.041
Shoshanna throwing food
at Jessa is an improvisation.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.041
Get out of my face!

30:27.041 --> 30:28.208
And afterwards, Jemima was like,

30:28.500 --> 30:30.125
"You threw a pig in a blanket
at my face!"

30:30.125 --> 30:31.375
And Zosh was like,
"Were you mad?"

30:31.542 --> 30:32.917
And Jemima was like,
"No, it was cool."

30:34.542 --> 30:36.917
KONNER: When Lena wrote it,
she wanted the set

30:36.917 --> 30:39.583
in Upstate New York
to look like the movie

30:39.583 --> 30:40.542
Straw Dogs.

30:40.542 --> 30:42.542
I was very excited to see

30:42.542 --> 30:45.083
what Lena's version
of Straw Dogs  would be.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.959
(DESI HOOTING)

30:46.959 --> 30:49.583
Okay, you can... cool that down.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.875
Tim Ives... the DP and I made
a really, like,

30:51.875 --> 30:53.917
intense aesthetic choice
to shoot something

30:53.917 --> 30:55.708
in a almost genre-y  way.

30:55.708 --> 30:56.750
Okay! (GASPS)

30:57.208 --> 30:58.417
DUNHAM: We really were shooting
at four a.m.

30:58.417 --> 30:59.333
in Upstate New York, and Ebon...

30:59.333 --> 31:00.542
(SCREAMS)

31:00.542 --> 31:02.083
...was actually
kind of terrifying.

31:02.083 --> 31:02.792
Yeah.

31:03.208 --> 31:04.375
-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-(SCREAMING)

31:05.000 --> 31:08.083
This is when we discover that
Desi is a habitual drug user.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.667
You've been taking it
for a year?

31:09.667 --> 31:10.917
Oh, yeah!

31:10.917 --> 31:13.417
You were fucking high
at our wedding!

31:13.417 --> 31:14.583
Oh, fuck yeah!

31:14.917 --> 31:18.000
Desi has been a real
"be careful what you wish for"

31:18.000 --> 31:19.917
kind of story for Marnie.

31:20.125 --> 31:23.125
She wanted someone creative,
and intoxicating,

31:23.125 --> 31:25.875
and often those people are
horrendous narcissists.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.667
Stop it! Not that in public!
Stop it!

31:28.667 --> 31:31.625
Marnie's so controlling that,
like, I think she has this sense

31:31.625 --> 31:33.041
that she can fix people.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.583
She's embarrassed that
her marriage broke up.

31:35.583 --> 31:37.291
I think that there is
this fantasy

31:37.291 --> 31:38.875
that "maybe we can
make it work."

31:39.208 --> 31:41.708
She kind of always sees
the bright side of things,

31:41.708 --> 31:43.291
and thinks,
"Today is the first day

31:43.291 --> 31:44.333
of the rest of my life."

31:44.917 --> 31:46.417
HANNAH: Seriously, Marnie,
it can be pretty hard

31:46.417 --> 31:47.834
to have observations
about other people

31:47.834 --> 31:49.458
when you're only thinking
about yourself.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.375
I would know.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.291
DUNHAM: Hannah's always kind
of known that she's

31:54.500 --> 31:56.417
self-involved,
and isn't that upset about it.

31:56.792 --> 31:59.000
Two seasons ago, she would have
gone storming out of the house,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.333
and, like, tried
to hitch a ride.

32:00.542 --> 32:02.834
And I'm not judging you, okay?
I promise.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
I think if there's something
that she learns, it's, like,

32:05.500 --> 32:08.375
she actually shows Marnie
some real empathy.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.583
The things they've been through
have made them

32:10.583 --> 32:12.000
more empathic
towards each other.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.166
-We don't know shit, do we?
-Nope.

32:14.542 --> 32:16.500
They're really for each other
this season,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.458
in a sort of loving,
non-judgmental way.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.792
(LAUGHS)
