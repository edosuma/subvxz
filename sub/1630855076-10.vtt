-I miss him, too.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.348
I just-- Bob was just a little
too passive for me.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.142
-Yeah? Yeah.
-Yeah. No, I can see that.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.768
-You know, "take a stand, Bob."
Something.
-Right.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.021
And plus, you know,
after Dad, it's like... (scoffs)

18:25.021 --> 18:26.814
...how can you top that, ever,
you know?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.899
Well, your dad wasn't perfect.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.277
I know. I know.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.654
But he was... good.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.781
I'm sober
and I'm still not good.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.242
Are you sure
he's my biological father?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.578
-Yes.
-(laughs)

18:40.578 --> 18:43.706
-David made mistakes.
-Oh.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.042
Yeah. He didn't floss.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.668
-Uh-huh.
-He sat on the laundry

18:47.668 --> 18:49.503
instead of folding it.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.714
And, um, he, um, and...

18:53.341 --> 18:55.009
...he left us for a while.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.303
(chuckles) No, he didn't.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.055
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.723
When you were about
ten months old,

19:00.723 --> 19:03.559
he chose to go to New York,
and he left us behind.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.686
And he spent about a year there,
playing music, and...

19:05.686 --> 19:08.230
(scoffs)

19:08.230 --> 19:10.608
Why didn't he just
take us with him?

19:10.608 --> 19:13.986
I think he was spoked
by having a family.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.073
We were young.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.659
He wanted to chase his dreams,
you know.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.411
This feels like kind of
a big deal.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.871
Why didn't you ever
tell me this?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.247
Because you didn't need to know.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.415
Uh--

19:26.415 --> 19:30.044
Samantha, he came back.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.797
And we were okay. Maybe...

19:32.797 --> 19:34.632
maybe better, even.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.634
How did you know
it would get better?

19:38.052 --> 19:40.137
I didn't.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.931
We don't.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.809
-Scary.
-Yeah.

19:44.809 --> 19:48.354
Is what you're going through now
the end of the world?

19:48.354 --> 19:49.563
I don't think so.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.357
(chuckles)

19:51.357 --> 19:52.733
Life is long.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.153
So long.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.405
Endless.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.619
-All right. (grunts)
-Wow.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.538
-Is that a return? Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, obviously.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.581
Look at this thing.
It's so ugly.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.834
Why would you let me buy it?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.920
Well, unfortunately,
that was marked "final sale."

20:12.920 --> 20:15.548
Unfortunately, um,
you should know that

20:15.548 --> 20:19.844
I'm currently the sponsor of
12 recovering alcoholics,

20:19.844 --> 20:22.012
and if you don't process
my return,

20:22.012 --> 20:25.099
I guess we're just gonna have to
start holding our meetings here.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.310
We'll just sit on
all these beautiful sofas.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.105
Spilling coffee everywhere.
Tears.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.441
-You know what doesn't
sell lamps?
-What?

20:33.441 --> 20:36.402
People sobbing about
their alcoholic parents.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.196
Oh, and next week, we're going
through our sex inventories.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
-It gets real dark, real fast.
-(cashier groans)

20:41.073 --> 20:43.159
Okay, I get it.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.454
Here.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.330
Nice doing business with you.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.457
