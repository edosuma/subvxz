WEBVTT

00:12.346 --> 00:13.747
Hey!

00:13.781 --> 00:15.516
What is that?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.185
You know, in case
you didn't eat.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.420
Big trial starting
today and all.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.754
Come on, it's your
favorite drink.

00:20.788 --> 00:24.058
It's got yogurt and
wheat germ and tofu and

00:24.092 --> 00:25.326
egg shells and...

00:25.359 --> 00:27.461
some kind of
grass trimmings.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.729
I am trying a
major murder case

00:28.762 --> 00:30.831
in front of a judge
that likes to call me

00:30.864 --> 00:33.334
"that Reagan chick"
when I'm not in the room.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.436
I had steak and eggs
and B12 shot.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.638
Great... then call this
dessert. Come on.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.508
Shouldn't you be out catching
killers and robbers

00:40.541 --> 00:41.775
and not worrying
about your sister?

00:41.809 --> 00:43.544
Uh, I'm feeling
generous today.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.779
Figured I'd give him
a 20 minute head start.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.281
I'm late.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.749
Thank you.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.584
You're welcome.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.654
ERIN: This is a
very familiar story.

00:53.687 --> 00:57.091
The defendant and Delamar,

00:57.125 --> 01:00.294
the 28-year-old
nightclub hostess,

01:00.328 --> 01:02.563
when she met Samuel Delamar,

01:02.596 --> 01:05.299
a much older
investment counselor

01:05.333 --> 01:06.867
and a multimillionaire.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.438
They met, they married.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.607
They did not live
happily ever after.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.479
The people will
present evidence

01:18.512 --> 01:20.148
that shows the defendant

01:20.181 --> 01:22.116
enjoyed her husband's money

01:22.150 --> 01:24.485
more than she
enjoyed her husband.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.654
She had affairs.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.156
They quarreled.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.391
And after one final
bitter argument,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.726
in front of shocked witnesses,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.328
she returned to
the townhouse that

01:34.362 --> 01:36.530
she shared with her husband,

01:36.564 --> 01:39.167
and stabbed him to death.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.868
FRANK:
Here you go.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.237
Grave business
made palatable

01:43.271 --> 01:45.673
by fine food and drink.
Thank you so much, Frank.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.575
My pleasure, Ian.
How you doing on time?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.477
Oh, good enough
if I get going.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.344
Yeah.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.415
All good, guys?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.150
Oh, our host, Jimmy Reagan.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.185
Ian Cameron.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.786
Reagan, huh?
You two related?

01:58.819 --> 02:01.855
Not at all. I've made through
investigations to be sure.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.857
Ian is deputy commissioner for

02:03.891 --> 02:05.426
counterterrorism
at Scotland Yard.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.860
Ah...

02:06.894 --> 02:08.696
Uh, lovely meal.
Thank you very much.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.431
Can I ask you a question?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.267
Where do you cops
really their your pieces?
Pardon?

02:13.301 --> 02:14.735
JIMMY: Come on, you guys
gotta be packing something

02:14.768 --> 02:16.570
other than a baton
and that accent.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.871
What, ankle holsters?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.608
Different cultures.
Different methods.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.277
Again, Frank,
thank you.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.412
You're welcome.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.248
(chuckles)
Pleasure.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.654
Why didn't you just come right
out and call his men girls?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.323
It's a legitimate question.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.491
Excuse me, did anybody try
to discourage you

02:37.525 --> 02:39.493
from going into
the hospitality business?

02:39.527 --> 02:42.263
Hey, I succeed on
big drinks and great meat.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.265
Not by kissing ass.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.967
And your ancestors would be
spinning in their graves,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.270
you taking
Scotland Yard to lunch.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.438
It's a new century.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.639
Ah, tell them that.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.773
How?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.775
I'm just saying.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.777
Oh, we sent the menu for your

02:56.810 --> 02:58.779
birthday dinner
over to the office.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.848
Why? I want it the same
as it always is.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.351
Your daughter called and
asked for a seafood option.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.986
Can you get me some
Wellfleet oysters?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.855
Well, usually when we...

03:07.888 --> 03:10.691
Oysters are the
seafood of choice.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.960
Anyone who has a problem
with that, let 'em eat cake.

03:15.363 --> 03:19.333
Miss Reagan told you
this was a familiar story.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.002
Well, maybe it's
familiar to her because

03:22.035 --> 03:25.706
she's seen too many stories
where spouses are villains.

03:25.739 --> 03:29.277
When married don't
actually love each other.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.745
I don't know, maybe
she's reading something

03:31.779 --> 03:33.381
in there from
her own experience,

03:33.414 --> 03:35.449
from her own divorce.
Your Honor!

03:35.483 --> 03:37.685
Mr. Kelly, counsel's
personal life is not

03:37.718 --> 03:39.487
relevant to any part
of this trial.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.488
Sorry, Judge.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.556
Of course it isn't.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.359
What matters here is
Ann Delamar's personal life.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.661
Which has been
shattered by the death

03:47.695 --> 03:48.962
of the husband she loved.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.964
A death, in which the so called

03:50.998 --> 03:53.967
evidence against her is nothing
but an ancient stereotype.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.870
Yes, she is young
and attractive,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.706
but so are millions of women.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.874
So is, with all due respect,
Miss Reagan.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.610
Does that mean
any man she marries

04:02.643 --> 04:03.944
has to watch his back?

04:03.977 --> 04:04.978
Sorry.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.914
Bad example.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.450
What the defense will show

04:09.483 --> 04:13.487
is that Anne Delamar had nothing
to do with this murder.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.856
We will show that
Samuel Delamar was engaged

04:15.889 --> 04:17.891
in a shadowy
business arrangement

04:17.925 --> 04:18.959
with at least one other man--

04:18.992 --> 04:21.329
a man known as M--

04:21.362 --> 04:22.596
that he quarreled
with this man

04:22.630 --> 04:24.732
and that the
authorities failed to

04:24.765 --> 04:26.700
pursue this clear-cut suspect

04:26.734 --> 04:29.537
because they had,
conveniently in hand,

04:29.570 --> 04:32.973
a familiar suspect--

04:33.006 --> 04:34.942
the pretty, young wife.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.813
ERIN: So, you're sure you want
to be watching

04:39.847 --> 04:40.881
a trial on your time off?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.784
I mean, shouldn't you be taking
a nap or something

04:43.817 --> 04:44.785
before you go on duty tonight?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.821
My big sister kicking butt
in a murder case?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.923
I'll bring out pom-poms and
start leading cheers.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.426
Ah, I believe that would
be contempt of court.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.995
(chuckles) Well, maybe I'll just
shoot your opposing counsel.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.764
No jury will convict me.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.666
That guy's a piece of work.
Yeah.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.835
Defense Strategy 101:
Throw buckets of mud

05:01.869 --> 05:04.738
and hope none of it
falls on your client.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.342
Guess I missed
that course at Harvard.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.544
Wait, is this some kind of

05:10.578 --> 05:12.746
sentimental look
at the road not taken?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.882
You kidding? The more I see
the law in action,

05:14.915 --> 05:16.116
the happier I am I'm a cop.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.885
I'll see ya tomorrow.
(chuckles)

05:17.918 --> 05:19.587
See ya.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.121
DAVIDSON:
Ms. Reagan!

05:21.154 --> 05:23.891
I... Could you...?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.794
I... I just wanted
to say, you know,

05:26.827 --> 05:27.695
it was nothing
personal in there.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.863
Oh, really?
Dragging my personal life

05:29.897 --> 05:31.899
into opening statements
isn't personal?

05:31.932 --> 05:32.933
Well, maybe a little.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.370
But, uh, all in the
service of the client, right?

05:36.404 --> 05:38.372
Actually no, not right.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.008
Hm!

05:41.041 --> 05:43.644
I gotta go,
but thought for the day:

05:43.677 --> 05:46.614
You might do better in court
and in your personal life

05:46.647 --> 05:48.416
if you just
lightened up a little.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.819
Wha...?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.123
Mr. Kelly!

06:01.995 --> 06:02.963
(groans)

06:02.996 --> 06:05.365
So tempting.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.488
Mr. Kelly...

06:27.521 --> 06:30.090
You forgot your bag.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.128
Mr. Kelly?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.867
Oh, my God.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.168
Oh!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.228
Did he tell you
why he had to go?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.229
No, he just looked
at his watch

07:09.262 --> 07:10.664
and said, "I gotta go,"

07:10.698 --> 07:11.865
which by the way,
was the least offensive

07:11.899 --> 07:13.133
thing he said to me all day.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.135
So, I take it you won't be
speaking at the funeral?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.069
No.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.705
Look, I told you guys
everything I know.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.540
Yeah, but the thing is,
we haven't been able

07:19.573 --> 07:23.010
to find anyone else who saw
or talked to him after you did.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.845
Okay, but that doesn't
change the fact

07:24.878 --> 07:27.481
that I've told you
everything I know.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.882
What happened, by the way?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.584
Well, it looks like
he was stabbed.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.252
We found the knife,
but it was wiped clean.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.755
So, someone slipped in,
stabbed him, no noise?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.824
Sounds like you
know exactly how it happened.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
Right. I killed him.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.961
Well, you were the last person
to see him alive and

07:40.994 --> 07:43.196
he was killed after you
had a heated argument with him.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.933
In court. It's called
opening statements.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.934
You buying this?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.035
I don't speak.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.770
I'm leaving.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.638
Don't leave town.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.272
We're watching you!

07:52.305 --> 07:55.242
You Reagans sure know how
to have a good time.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.077
(sighs)

07:58.546 --> 08:00.113
MOORE:
Don't kill the messenger.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.782
And why are you
the messenger?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.618
Because charges on the PC's
credit card are press sensitive,

08:04.652 --> 08:06.520
and I'd like to keep it
in this office.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.022
How long's this
been going on?
Near as I can tell,

08:09.056 --> 08:11.992
the bogus charges started in
last October's billing cycle.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.226
They were smart.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.728
They broke in
the counterfeit cards

08:14.762 --> 08:16.630
using little things like
car-service rides

08:16.664 --> 08:17.598
and event tickets.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.099
I don't use a car service.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.301
Well, you and I know that, but
the credit card company doesn't.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.237
The foundation that
provides the credit card does.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.607
Frank, you're the PC.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.875
And the commissioner's
foundation

08:27.908 --> 08:29.176
is your number-one fan club.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.278
The last thing they want
to do is embarrass you.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.614
$12,000 case of wine.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.049
Which they probably unloaded
for ten, clear profit.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.552
(sighs)
How bad's it get?

08:38.586 --> 08:43.691
Well, the charges that goosed
the Foundation bookkeeping

08:43.724 --> 08:46.660
include a $40,000 strand
of Mikimoto pearls.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.261
What the hell's a Mikimoto?

08:48.295 --> 08:50.263
An expensive kind of pearl
would be my guess.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.332
You're having fun here.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.001
Not at all.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.303
And where are we
with catching them?

08:56.336 --> 08:59.206
The credit card company's
running the patterns.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.775
It looks to be about
30 onyx cards

09:01.809 --> 09:04.612
that were scanned
and then duplicated,

09:04.645 --> 09:06.714
and put into use.
I gotta hand it to them...

09:06.747 --> 09:07.948
Hand'em what?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.917
The onyx cards have
a really high limit.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.352
And the people who use them,
are used to seeing

09:12.385 --> 09:14.154
huge numbers at
the end of the month.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.724
If you're going to run a scam,
it's the sweet spot.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.228
I'll reach out
to special frauds.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.897
See what we have on our side.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.700
Set up drinks with
the chair of the foundation.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.368
I want to clear this up
face-to-face.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.303
Right away.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.172
Might want to make yours
the house scotch.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.244
You were there when
it happened, Ms. Reagan.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.079
Across the street,
your honor.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.380
And the police
don't know who did it?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.651
I think I can
convince them to rule me out.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.853
But, I believe we're hear
to discuss a mistrial?

09:45.886 --> 09:46.987
No...

09:47.020 --> 09:48.221
No what?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.691
My client wants to proceed.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.292
With out your partner,
Mrs. Marshall?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.361
I'm just as familiar
with the case as he was.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.996
We can go on
without him just fine.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.765
That's a very touching
display of grief.

09:57.798 --> 10:01.034
Will you want to recess
for the funeral or no?

10:01.068 --> 10:04.337
I just want to clear my name and
get my life back here on Earth.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.373
I believe I have
that right.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.177
If the defense is going to imply
that whoever killed Mr. Kelly

10:10.210 --> 10:11.679
is the same mysterious villain

10:11.712 --> 10:13.814
that supposedly
killed Mr. Delamar

10:13.847 --> 10:15.683
that will confuse
and mislead the jury.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.218
These are two separate
and distinct cases.

10:18.251 --> 10:21.021
I'll thank you, counselor,
not to instruct me.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.323
I was not trying
to instruct you, Judge Haywood.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.425
I was merely trying
to point out that...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.127
I've already had
the jury sequestered.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.930
There'll be no confusion
regarding the two separate

10:29.963 --> 10:31.865
and distinct cases.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.168
I'll see you both
tomorrow morning...

10:35.202 --> 10:36.704
...in court.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.405
MARSHALL:
Thank you, your honor.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.443
CURATOLA: This dead lawyer
hung with a rough crowd--

10:43.476 --> 10:45.813
drug dealers,
rapists, murderers.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.915
Could have tangled with
an unsatisfied customer.

10:47.948 --> 10:48.916
Mm-hmm.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.350
Anything in the briefcase?

10:50.383 --> 10:54.321
Yeah, newspaper, breath mints,
half-eaten tuna sandwich.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.824
Trial prep notes...

10:57.991 --> 10:59.159
(chuckles)

10:59.192 --> 11:01.161
"ADA is Erin Reagan.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.162
Cold fish."

11:02.195 --> 11:03.463
Ooh.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.165
"Play warm to jury
for contrast."

11:05.198 --> 11:06.900
Well, if your sister saw that,
maybe she did kill him.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.970
Well, it's partially true.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.307
Kelly got a text
right before he was killed.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.810
"Meet me at the benches
at Foley Square.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.245
I can help you find M."

11:18.278 --> 11:18.879
M?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.413
Beats the hell out of me.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.850
It looks like Kelly
had a date with this killer.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.857
I live in the Delamars' house.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.292
But that night, I was off work.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.095
I went with my sister
to the movies.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.197
And what,
if anything, did you see

11:37.230 --> 11:38.899
when you returned to the house?

11:38.932 --> 11:44.471
I was walking by Mr. Delamar's
study when I heard a noise.

11:44.504 --> 11:49.943
I looked in and saw
Mr. Delamar on the floor...

11:49.977 --> 11:51.779
eyes open...

11:51.812 --> 11:53.013
not moving.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.851
And, uh, Mrs. Delamar was
next to him, kneeling.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.789
And in her hand was
Mr. Delamar's letter opener,

12:01.822 --> 12:03.490
covered with blood.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.259
When she saw me,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.995
she said, "Call the police,

12:08.028 --> 12:09.262
Mr. Delamar is hurt."

12:09.296 --> 12:13.133
ERIN: In the days
before his death,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.203
how did the relationship between
the Delamars appear to you?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.470
Objection. The witness
is a housekeeper,

12:17.504 --> 12:18.972
not a marriage councilor.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.508
She is also a
human being with ears and eyes.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.510
She can answer the question.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.179
POLANSKI:
Very bad.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.883
Arguing, close doors...

12:29.917 --> 12:30.918
Thank you.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.557
So part of your job,
Mrs. Polanski,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.559
was to eavesdrop on
your employers?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.194
No.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.863
I just heard things.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.531
Did you hear an argument between

12:44.564 --> 12:47.935
Mr. Delamar and a male visitor
a few days before he was killed?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.537
Yes, Mr. Delamar answered the
door himself.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.172
I never saw him.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.440
Did they argue?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.809
Yes, there was shouting.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.845
Something about
money, I think.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.347
I give you Defendant's One:

13:01.214 --> 13:02.883
Mr. Delamar's datebook.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.054
Do you see the notation
for the time

13:07.087 --> 13:10.523
that visitor arrived?

13:10.557 --> 13:13.126
Yes. 2:00.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.161
It says M.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.596
So Mr. Delamar and a man named M

13:16.629 --> 13:18.832
had a loud argument
about money.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.133
Objection.
Asked and answered.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.168
Withdrawn.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.103
Mrs. Polanski...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.572
after Mrs. Delamar

13:25.605 --> 13:27.841
asked you to call the police,

13:27.875 --> 13:30.110
what else did she say?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.946
That she found
Mr. Delamar that way.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.548
She heard a noise,
so she went in there

13:35.582 --> 13:37.584
and there he was.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.889
MARSHALL:
Thank you.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.890
Redirect.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.057
Mrs. Polanski.

13:44.091 --> 13:48.461
Who did you see kneeling over
Mr. Delamar's dead body

13:48.495 --> 13:50.864
with a bloody
letter opener?

13:50.898 --> 13:51.999
A man named M,

13:52.032 --> 13:54.367
or the defendant, Mrs. Delamar?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.070
Her.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.039
ERIN:
Thank you.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.312
DANNY:
Counselor, wait up!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.047
Just in time
to buy me lunch.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.615
Unless you're going
to arrest me for murder.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.251
Actually, it's neither.
I got date with Mrs. Marshall.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.519
The defendant's attorney?

14:12.552 --> 14:13.954
Well, that's in your world.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.889
In my world, she's
the victim's partner.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.991
I don't know, apparently Kelly
was trying to find some,

14:18.025 --> 14:20.227
uh, mysterious "M" person
that got him killed.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.328
Not you, too.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.162
What do you mean,
"not me, too"?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.363
The defense is pointing

14:23.396 --> 14:25.966
to some phantom "M"
as the actual killer.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.267
Well, that's
the Delamar case.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.168
I'm dealing with
the Kelly case.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.070
Ms. Marshall said Kelly was
trying to find

14:30.103 --> 14:31.104
somebody named
Monroe or something.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.907
Look, somebody gives me
information on a homicide,

14:33.941 --> 14:34.908
I got to look in to it.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.376
It was looked into.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.945
By a little
organization called

14:37.978 --> 14:39.346
the New York City
Police Department.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.048
You may have heard of it.
And?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.315
Not a trace.
All right.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.217
That was then,
this is now.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.618
Oh, well fine.
While you're at it,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.587
why don't you look for
a one-armed man.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
What are you talking about,
a one-armed man?

14:49.656 --> 14:52.025
Look, Kelly was a
sleazebag defense attorney

14:52.059 --> 14:53.360
who had sleazy clients.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.661
Anybody could have
killed him.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.396
So what?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.031
You are being
used, Danny.
Okay, you know what?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.632
If I'm being used,
I'll make that

14:59.666 --> 15:02.002
determination for
myself, all right?
Well, I certainly hope so.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.070
And there was a one-armed man.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.504
He had one arm--
I saw the movie.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.373
Hey.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.175
Sorry I'm late.
What'd I miss?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.642
Nothing.
Nothing.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.954
My wife, Sharon,

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
and Sam Delamar to went
to high school together.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.192
I met him at
the 35th reunion

15:25.225 --> 15:26.326
and I started
investing with him.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.528
He did very well.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.363
Sam was a great
stock picker.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.500
And we socialized
with him and Ann.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.069
Including the night
he died Mr. Harris?
Yes.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.437
ERIN:
And how did that go?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.671
Not well.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.040
In what way?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.474
We're talking about
this and that.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.543
We just returned from a vacation
in Italy and, um,

15:43.576 --> 15:48.515
Sam made a comment about
a credit card bill.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.385
He said that Ann was
spending too much.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.056
And how did Mrs. Delamar
react to that?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.491
She said that, um,

15:58.525 --> 16:01.161
he had plenty of money
and what was the problem.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.030
And, uh,

16:03.063 --> 16:04.531
he said it would
probably be cheaper

16:04.564 --> 16:06.066
to hire her by the hour

16:06.099 --> 16:10.203
and, uh, he would find
some way to cut her off.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.273
Ann stomped
out of the restaurant.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.675
A few minutes later,
Sam left.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.345
He said he was going to
go home and talk to her.

16:18.378 --> 16:23.683
And the next morning,
I heard he was dead.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.452
Thank you.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.598
ERIN: Mrs. Harris,
I'm sorry about

16:38.631 --> 16:40.167
the inconvenience, but I don't
have the exact time

16:40.200 --> 16:42.235
I'll be calling you
to the stand.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.636
Do you really need me?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.772
Well, if you can
add anything to what

16:45.805 --> 16:47.474
your husband
said about the argument.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.609
Well, I'm sure I... I can't.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.212
Walter's so much more
precise than I am.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.082
Sharon is absolutely terrified
of public speaking.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.416
(anxious sigh)
I understand.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.151
I will be as as
brief as possible.

16:58.185 --> 17:02.055
I've known Sam Delamar
since we were kids.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.224
I'm afraid I'd break down.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.694
I don't think I...
I'd be good for anybody.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.298
I promise-- if I don't really
need you, I won't call you.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.274
Chairman's ten minutes out,

17:21.308 --> 17:23.310
and mortified that
he's keeping you waiting.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.312
And I'm mortified about
the credit card charges.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.847
Which aren't your fault.
We can just call it even.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.748
BELL:
Well, look at this.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.383
Batman brought Robin.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
This drink's been watered down.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.321
What, a Shirley Temple?
No.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.655
What's the good word?

17:35.688 --> 17:38.358
Partnership, actually.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.193
With you?

17:40.227 --> 17:41.361
Who's the patsy?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.463
Uh, there's three of them.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.465
I see my bartender
and two of my waiters

17:45.498 --> 17:47.534
came to me with
an offer and I took it.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.102
Like what?

17:49.136 --> 17:53.106
Like I get some cash
and a bank note.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.542
They run
the day-to-day operations

17:55.575 --> 17:57.244
for a piece of the net.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.779
Where does a bartender and a
waiter get that kind of cheddar?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.581
Out of my till.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.516
No... (stammering)
good guys.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.285
They work hard,
and they live cheap.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.388
Well...

18:08.421 --> 18:10.557
congratulations, I guess.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.526
I got two bad hips,
a neglected third wife,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.195
and the liver
the size of a salmon.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.629
I can't work full-time anymore.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.231
(sighs)
Where will you go?

18:18.265 --> 18:21.168
I'll still be here, but
just for the dinner seatings.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.669
And always on
your birthday.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.813
Here we go.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.548
Case file on the Delamar murder.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.784
Oh, I'm sure the detective
that was handling it is, uh,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.586
glad we're reinvestigating.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.322
Yeah, actually, he did kind of
tell me to go screw myself.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.690
Ah, making friends
wherever we go.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.624
So, what's in it?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.193
Oh, we got the prenup that made

18:46.226 --> 18:47.694
Delamar worth more dead
than divorced.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.497
We got a report from
a P.I. who tracked down

18:50.530 --> 18:52.299
Mrs. Delamar's boyfriend.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.201
And she and her husband
were still together?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.236
Maybe he forgave her.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.670
Maybe she renounced
her sinful ways.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.372
Yeah, that always happens.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.174
All right, I got
Delamar's phone records here.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.609
You got Kelly's over there?
Yeah, right here.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.910
(clears throat)
What turned up
on the phone

19:03.943 --> 19:05.345
that texted Kelly
and got him killed?

19:05.378 --> 19:07.714
It's a prepaid cell,
so it's untraceable.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.781
Okay, but look at this,

19:08.815 --> 19:11.584
Delamar called the phone
that sent the text to Kelly.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.952
Maybe he was trying
to track down Monroe, too.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.221
You think it's a coincidence?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.922
No.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.424
(dialing phone)

19:20.427 --> 19:21.728
Yes, I'm trying to reach Monroe.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.265
I'm a lawyer, um,
I was working with

19:25.298 --> 19:26.933
Roger Kelly on the Delamar case.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.268
I think Monroe may
have something

19:28.301 --> 19:29.369
that could help me there.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.704
Okay.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.341
11:30 it is.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.543
Well, imagine that.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.678
Guy says he can
help me find Monroe.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.213
Sound familiar?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.315
By the benches in Foley Square?

19:42.349 --> 19:44.284
Nope. Crab House.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.900
(clears throat)

20:00.933 --> 20:01.934
Nice suit.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.371
Yeah.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.905
I'm a successful lawyer,
can't you tell?

20:05.938 --> 20:08.808
I'll have to call
all my single girlfriends.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.976
Well, careful.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.779
I feel like I look like my
sister's creepy ex-husband.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.982
You see any likelies?

20:16.015 --> 20:18.017
Uh, not really.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.387
(cell phone rings)
JACKIE: But the dude next
to me wants me to

20:20.420 --> 20:22.289
mother his children, so...

20:23.623 --> 20:25.558
Hey, I'm here.
Where are you?

20:28.728 --> 20:29.862
Okay.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.465
I'll see you in a minute.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.301
He wants me to wait outside.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.968
He's in a car.
He's gonna pick me up.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.470
Danny, you wearing a vest?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.406
It's a four-piece suit, Jack.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.671
I don't like this.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.506
Let's just give it a minute,
all right?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.442
Reagan, don't get in the car.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.443
Don't worry, Jack.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.545
Let's just ride it out
and see what happens.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.683
(engine starts)

21:23.716 --> 21:25.051
This could be our guy, Jack.

21:39.699 --> 21:40.633
Whoa, whoa, Danny!

21:48.074 --> 21:49.709
You all right?

21:49.742 --> 21:51.511
Yeah.
What the hell?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.546
Are you trying to get
tread marks on your forehead?

21:53.580 --> 21:55.615
What do you mean? I'm trying to
get a look at the guy's face!

21:55.648 --> 21:57.116
Oh, God.
Did you get the plate?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.352
No.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.528
(elevator bell dings)

22:11.898 --> 22:12.865
What are you doing here?

22:12.899 --> 22:15.368
Shouldn't you be out
pursuing the mythical Mr. M?

22:15.402 --> 22:17.103
Actually, I came to
tell you that I think

22:17.136 --> 22:19.439
the mysterious Mr. M tried
to kill me last night.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.773
Detective,

22:20.807 --> 22:22.141
I hear you
made some progress

22:22.174 --> 22:23.710
in the investigation
we discussed.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.413
Actually, I got nothing
conclusive yet, Counselor.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.380
Don't be modest.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.716
I think the jury should hear
all about it.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.820
You're gonna
subpoena me?

22:33.853 --> 22:36.889
To testify at our trial...
for the defense.

22:44.497 --> 22:47.800
Special Frauds is certain
Jimmy's is one of the places?

22:47.834 --> 22:50.136
Along with about a dozen other
high-end restaurants.

22:50.169 --> 22:53.606
There's a plastics fabricator
in Washington Heights

22:53.640 --> 22:56.142
where they think the bogus
cards are being manufactured.

22:56.175 --> 23:00.012
Took all my boys there for their
first beer with the old man.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.415
And how many years
of birthday dinners?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.419
20-odd.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.923
Do you think he could have
that kind of activity going on

23:10.957 --> 23:13.025
in his store
and not know about it?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.461
Absolutely.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.498
What makes you so sure?

23:18.531 --> 23:20.733
Nothing.
I'm just not cynical enough

23:20.767 --> 23:22.569
to believe
Jimmy could be in on it.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.938
That's a luxury
I wish I could afford.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.208
What do you want to do here?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.444
(sighs)

23:32.779 --> 23:34.781
Nothing I can do.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.719
Ms. Marshall,
call your next witness.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.887
Thank you, Your Honor.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.056
The defense calls
Detective Daniel Reagan.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.942
Do you swear or affirm
to tell the truth,

24:02.975 --> 24:05.244
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.480
I do.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.924
"Meet me by the benches
in Foley Square.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.493
I can help you find M."

24:20.527 --> 24:22.895
How long
before Mr. Kelly's murder

24:22.929 --> 24:24.263
was that text message sent?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.698
About ten minutes.

24:25.732 --> 24:29.135
As an expert homicide detective,

24:29.168 --> 24:31.504
what conclusion
would you draw from that?

24:31.538 --> 24:32.972
That Mr. Kelly
was probably killed

24:33.005 --> 24:34.674
by the person
who sent that message.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.676
MARSHALL:
Probably?

24:36.709 --> 24:39.211
At this moment, do you
have any other suspects?

24:39.245 --> 24:40.412
No, I don't.

24:40.446 --> 24:43.149
Detective, since you've began
investigating this murder,

24:43.182 --> 24:44.917
has someone tried to kill you?

24:47.286 --> 24:50.256
Actually, yes, somebody tried
to run me down in a car.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.859
MARSHALL: Is this
connected to your search

24:52.892 --> 24:54.093
for a person named M?

24:54.126 --> 24:55.695
That's hard to say.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.531
Really? So what were
you doing at the time

24:58.565 --> 25:00.733
that this attempt was made
on your life?

25:00.767 --> 25:04.236
I was trying to track down
the person known as M.

25:04.270 --> 25:08.240
So, tracking down M is
a dangerous occupation.

25:10.076 --> 25:13.212
As an experienced
homicide detective,

25:13.245 --> 25:15.247
would you say

25:15.281 --> 25:18.317
that M was a murderer?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.020
Well, I can't say that
at this time.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.055
Is that your current
working hypothesis?

25:23.089 --> 25:26.659
Yes, that is my current
working hypothesis.

25:26.693 --> 25:32.832
So, why, under this hypothesis,
would M murder Mr. Kelly?

25:32.865 --> 25:36.035
Maybe M was afraid

25:36.068 --> 25:39.105
that Mr. Kelly was going
to expose him.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.740
Exposed as what?

25:42.909 --> 25:44.911
Detective...

25:48.114 --> 25:52.218
...what could M possibly
be afraid of being exposed of?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.053
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.623
The witness is an expert
homicide detective.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.690
The objection is overruled.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.231
It's just a theory.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.333
Fine, Detective.

26:07.366 --> 26:12.204
What is your theory as to what M
was afraid would be exposed?

26:14.106 --> 26:17.810
That he was the killer
of Samuel Delamar.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.578
MARSHALL:
Thank you.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.616
Your witness.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.658
Detective...

26:34.193 --> 26:36.162
...isn't it possible

26:36.195 --> 26:38.330
that a mugger killed
Roger Kelly?

26:38.364 --> 26:40.099
It's possible.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.100
Or

26:41.133 --> 26:43.369
a dissatisfied criminal client
from his past?

26:43.402 --> 26:45.638
Yeah, that's possible, too.

26:45.672 --> 26:49.208
And you don't actually know who
tried to run you down, do you?

26:49.241 --> 26:50.777
No, I don't.
In fact,

26:50.810 --> 26:54.814
isn't it possible
that incident involved

26:54.847 --> 26:56.916
a random drunk driver?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.818
I suppose that is possible, yes.

26:58.851 --> 26:59.986
Or some

27:00.019 --> 27:02.254
other criminal
with a grudge against you.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.257
Who knew I would be there
at that exact time?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.126
Please let me ask the questions.

27:10.029 --> 27:14.300
This mysterious Mr. M--
have you ever seen him?

27:14.333 --> 27:15.234
No.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.003
Do you have any concrete proof

27:17.036 --> 27:18.304
that he even exists?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.206
No, I don't.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.874
So, isn't it just as likely

27:21.908 --> 27:24.443
that Mr. Kelly was
killed by a mugger

27:24.476 --> 27:28.047
and that you were run down
by some random drunk driver

27:28.080 --> 27:32.284
than that the two of you
have been attacked

27:32.318 --> 27:37.123
by this alleged person
that no one has ever seen?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.862
Actually, that's less likely.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.997
Based on what?

27:45.031 --> 27:47.166
Based on a series of deductions.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.868
Deductions based on what?

27:48.901 --> 27:50.036
One text message?

27:50.069 --> 27:52.204
It's not one text message.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.873
Mr. Kelly received
a text message

27:53.906 --> 27:55.975
saying somebody
could take him to M.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.977
Ten minutes later,
he was killed.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.346
I called the number
the text message came from.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.382
I asked for M, two hours later,
I was almost killed.

28:03.415 --> 28:07.119
I had a ham sandwich for lunch,
I mislaid my keys.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.422
The ham sandwich is not why
I mislaid my keys.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.259
I didn't realize we were talking
about deli meats, Counselor.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.928
I'm a detective
investigating a murder.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.496
I look for clues.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.332
I find a clue,
it leads me down a trail,

28:20.366 --> 28:21.801
I follow the trail.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.303
Okay.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.976
How many murderers are you
looking for currently?

28:30.009 --> 28:32.278
I have three open cases
right now.

28:32.311 --> 28:38.317
How many people drive drunk
in New York at any given time?

28:38.350 --> 28:40.219
I don't know.
Lots, I assume.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.888
So, is it

28:41.921 --> 28:45.892
possible that you've been
following the wrong trail here?

28:45.925 --> 28:48.094
Absolutely.
Anything is possible.

28:48.127 --> 28:51.097
ERIN: Right. Have you
ever suspected

28:51.130 --> 28:53.032
someone of murder,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.466
and then learned
they didn't do it?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.535
Yes.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.404
New information came to light.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.907
So, in those cases,

29:00.940 --> 29:05.311
you had been following
a trail that wasn't there?

29:05.344 --> 29:08.514
At that point
in the investigations,

29:08.547 --> 29:10.382
yes, but as I said...

29:10.416 --> 29:12.852
And if new information
hadn't come to light,

29:12.885 --> 29:14.821
innocent people may have gone
to prison?

29:14.854 --> 29:15.955
I don't think so.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.523
There are checks and balances
in the system for that.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.091
Well, it's a good thing,

29:19.125 --> 29:21.193
because you are trained
to follow a trail

29:21.227 --> 29:22.294
whether one exists or not,

29:22.328 --> 29:24.864
and if you can't come up
with a trail,

29:24.897 --> 29:26.198
you have nothing to do.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.100
That's a really big
oversimplification.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.902
Is it?
Yes!

29:29.936 --> 29:32.471
Who killed Roger Kelly?

29:32.504 --> 29:33.973
I don't know.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.208
Who killed Samuel Delamar?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.110
I don't know.
Then, Detective,

29:38.144 --> 29:42.114
I don't know why
we are listening to you at all.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.851
(sighs)

29:59.231 --> 30:00.867
Can you pass
the potatoes, please?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.270
Although I do suppose

30:04.303 --> 30:06.973
it's possible that
they're not actually potatoes.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.475
Maybe they're Brussels sprouts.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.143
Those are potatoes.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.478
Of course they're potatoes.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.914
No, honey, they may look
and smell like potatoes,

30:14.947 --> 30:17.083
but you never know.
Maybe I'm just

30:17.116 --> 30:19.318
jumping to a wrong
conclusion here.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.454
Is this by any chance about
something besides potatoes?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.190
JAMIE:
Danny, she was tough

30:24.223 --> 30:26.025
with her cross, but
that's her job.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.226
Yeah, I understand
it was a tough cross,

30:27.259 --> 30:28.260
and I understand
she was doing her job.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.529
What I don't understand
is her making all of our

30:30.562 --> 30:32.498
training and all our years
of experience

30:32.531 --> 30:33.966
look like it
counts for nothing.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.467
Like we're a bunch of
clowns sitting around

30:35.501 --> 30:36.535
guessing at things.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.237
Danny,
there's no version of this

30:38.270 --> 30:39.571
where Erin would make
that argument.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.140
I did not make that argument.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.875
Please pass the corned beef.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.912
Did you mean,
the alleged corned beef?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.246
LINDA:
Is there any chance

30:47.279 --> 30:48.247
we could just eat our dinner?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.081
JAMIE:
Look, she did her job,

30:49.115 --> 30:51.050
you did yours,
end of story, right?

30:51.083 --> 30:52.251
HENRY:
It's like

30:52.284 --> 30:53.485
they're ten and eight again.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.354
Which was bad enough
when they were ten and eight.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.623
You didn't have to ride
between them on car rides.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.458
You got to drive.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.927
I had ears.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.930
Are you sure she did it, Mom?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.132
Yeah.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.099
I mean,
could Uncle Danny be right?

31:07.133 --> 31:09.235
That's what the trial is for,
to find out.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.369
She did it.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.238
And I never said she didn't.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.339
You didn't.
I did what I was
required to do.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.141
You just went out there
and said...

31:15.174 --> 31:16.608
All right, all right,
that's enough!

31:17.709 --> 31:19.245
You two

31:19.278 --> 31:22.014
are doing the dishes.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.151
If making us do the dishes is
supposed to get us talking,

31:25.184 --> 31:26.485
it's not working.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.254
It was Pop's idea.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.688
Far as I'm concerned,

31:29.721 --> 31:32.158
it's just about getting
the dishes done, which does

31:32.191 --> 31:33.159
seem to be working.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.426
It's fine by me.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.028
Oh, it's fine by me.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.396
Remember the football
and the hat?

31:37.429 --> 31:38.197
She hid his football,

31:38.230 --> 31:41.633
so he snatched
her favorite hat.

31:41.667 --> 31:42.634
Could have ended there.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.003
Yep, but then she went

31:44.036 --> 31:45.137
and microwaved my football.

31:45.171 --> 31:47.373
Only after you took scissors
to my hat.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.475
Sounds familiar.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.211
I rest my case.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.282
(whistling)

31:58.317 --> 32:00.319
Hey. Nice Sunday
with the family?

32:00.352 --> 32:02.088
They disowned me.
Oh.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.622
All of them.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.292
Hey, Jack, this guy Monroe--
if he really exists,

32:06.325 --> 32:08.660
then he must have had a
beef with Delamar, right?

32:08.694 --> 32:10.729
So we're saying.
Okay, I keep thinking,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.331
what could the beef be about?

32:12.364 --> 32:13.966
Now, Delamar-- he
loved to pick stocks.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.634
He's supposed to be
a genius at it.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.404
The kind of roll he was on--
nobody could be that smart.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.571
Take a look at this.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.173
He bought six stocks

32:21.207 --> 32:22.541
right before the
companies either merged,

32:22.574 --> 32:24.343
got acquired or made some big
news announcement.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.711
Now look at his phone records.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.314
The calls between
him and Monroe

32:28.347 --> 32:31.250
spiked up right before each one
of the big stock buys.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.153
So, Delamar got
inside information

32:34.186 --> 32:35.187
from Monroe?

32:35.221 --> 32:37.289
Well, if him and Monroe have
some kind of beef

32:37.323 --> 32:38.590
or some kind of falling out
over money...

32:38.624 --> 32:40.626
Delamar ends up dead.
Exactly.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.394
But the one thing
I can't figure out is,

32:42.428 --> 32:43.762
each one of these deals was done

32:43.795 --> 32:45.531
by a different bank,
or a different law firm.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.732
So, where could Monroe
be sitting

32:46.765 --> 32:48.367
that he would know
about all these deals?

32:50.269 --> 32:51.303
Could be a legal printer.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.138
A what?

32:52.171 --> 32:53.339
A legal printer.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.041
These deals generate
fat contracts,

32:55.074 --> 32:56.375
they need tons of copies.

32:56.408 --> 32:59.045
There's gotta be a dozen
of them around the city.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.612
That's it.
I'm good.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.348
Let's split up
and go check them all out.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.349
I'm good.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.217
You gotta call my lawyer.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.286
Everything we do here
is legally privileged.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.587
I can't let you see anything
without a subpoena.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.022
Okay. But you did do the
printing for the deals

33:10.056 --> 33:11.390
on this list, right?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.725
I gotta ask my lawyer
if I can even tell you that.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.561
And I'm gonna do that
tomorrow because tonight

33:15.594 --> 33:17.296
is my wife's
sister's anniversary,

33:17.329 --> 33:19.331
and if I'm not in Great
Neck by 5:00, I'm toast.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.732
Unless you want
to arrest me.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.401
Give me an excuse
to miss it.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.203
Hey, just say the word.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.704
I was kidding.
Well, I'm not kidding.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.339
Look, just tell me,

33:27.373 --> 33:29.108
who in here would be able
to see the documents

33:29.141 --> 33:31.443
and know what's
in these deals?
These guys.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.647
Our employees have been
here 20 years on average.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.383
They're bonded
and vetted up the wazoo.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.384
What happens
in Rosebrock Printing

33:38.417 --> 33:40.286
stays in Rosebrock Printing.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.220
Well, what about money trouble?

33:41.253 --> 33:42.788
Any of these guys
ever need an extra buck?

33:42.821 --> 33:44.090
Get in hock with their bookie?

33:44.123 --> 33:46.192
Anything?
We take security
seriously.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.359
We monitor their financials.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.561
There are no cameras
or cell phones

33:49.595 --> 33:50.396
allowed in the plant.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.797
We have a full-time
security manager

33:51.830 --> 33:53.265
keeping an eye on everything.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.400
This is him
right over there.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.567
Monroe, could you
talk to this guy?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.403
I gotta get
to Great Neck.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.440
DANNY:
Hey! Hold it!

34:05.611 --> 34:06.412
Hey!

34:08.414 --> 34:09.448
Hey!

34:16.855 --> 34:19.091
Come here! Come here...

34:19.125 --> 34:22.628
You know, we never got to talk
at the crab house, buddy.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.730
Maybe we'll get
to do it now, huh?

34:24.763 --> 34:26.632
Come on.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.742
DANNY (over speaker): Okay,
Monroe, here's the bad news:

34:36.775 --> 34:38.577
we searched your house, we found
your car with the bullet hole,

34:38.610 --> 34:40.312
courtesy of my partner.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.848
We also found the cell phone
that was used to text Kelly.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.216
So what's the good news?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.252
We don't have
any good news for you.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.519
No. Plus, we found,

34:47.553 --> 34:49.555
uh, your bank accounts
in the Cayman Islands.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.457
Got a pretty nice
nest egg there.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.193
Seems you were going
to retire early with millions.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.129
That was until Kelly
started snooping around, right?

34:57.163 --> 34:58.297
And, of course,
you couldn't sit by

34:58.330 --> 35:00.466
and let that happen,
could you?

35:00.499 --> 35:01.700
So, bingo, you're looking
at two murders

35:01.733 --> 35:03.902
and attempted on a cop.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.204
What two?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.339
How do you get two?
DANNY: Come on.

35:07.373 --> 35:08.807
Don't play stupid with us.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.842
One, Kelly, two, Delamar.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.110
We know you know
how to count, all right?

35:12.144 --> 35:15.647
Seeing it was you and Delamar
who split up all those profits

35:15.681 --> 35:17.483
from the stocks you
illegally told him to buy.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.651
So why'd I kill him then?

35:19.685 --> 35:20.686
I don't like money?

35:20.719 --> 35:23.255
Well, maybe you didn't
feel like splitting it.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.357
Maybe you wanted to blackmail
him for some more,

35:25.391 --> 35:26.658
and he had a problem with that.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.927
Yeah, maybe I was in Las Vegas
when he got killed.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.895
Yeah, sure you were.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.197
No, you could look it up.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.564
I must be in about

35:32.598 --> 35:34.833
20 casino videos, plus

35:34.866 --> 35:37.236
there's a hooker named Shelley,
might remember me.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.270
Probably not.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.605
DANNY:
Look...

35:39.638 --> 35:41.407
we know you were
in Delamar's house

35:41.440 --> 35:42.908
and we know you argued with him.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.776
Maybe, but not that night.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.746
I came in one night about
a week before he was killed.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.282
He left a key out for me
so I could let myself in.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.184
But that night I was early,

35:52.218 --> 35:56.188
and, right there, in his office,
I see two people screwing.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.356
His wife and the boyfriend?

35:57.389 --> 35:58.957
No, not the wife.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.828
It was Delamar
and some, uh, old broad.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.863
Short blonde hair, his age.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.167
Yeah, I didn't want to see that.

36:17.776 --> 36:21.680
So it wasn't that
guy killed Delamar.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.483
And it wasn't the wife.
Nope.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.386
Come on, we'll ride
there together.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.561
It's funny.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.229
All of a sudden, you realize

36:37.263 --> 36:40.366
that your next
big birthday is 60,

36:40.399 --> 36:44.370
and you've been married for
30 years, and you think,

36:44.403 --> 36:45.971
"What's gonna happen now?"

36:46.004 --> 36:49.941
And you realize that
nothing's gonna happen now.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.912
You go on some trips,
you take up oil painting,

36:53.945 --> 36:59.451
you try to enjoy yourself,
but nothing happens.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.553
You're not gonna
start a new career,

37:01.587 --> 37:06.692
you're not gonna discover
some invention...

37:06.725 --> 37:08.727
fall in love.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.466
I fell in love.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.703
With Samuel Delamar.

37:17.736 --> 37:21.540
I had a crush on him
in high school,

37:21.573 --> 37:24.276
he had a crush on me,
and we were shy,

37:24.310 --> 37:29.748
never mentioned it
until our 35th reunion.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.618
So, 35 years too late.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.920
But it wasn't too late.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.290
No.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.993
What happened that night...
at the restaurant?

37:42.027 --> 37:44.496
What we said.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.899
Sam and Ann fought about money,
but she was really mad

37:47.933 --> 37:50.001
because she knew
she was losing him--

37:50.035 --> 37:51.970
she didn't know to me--

37:52.003 --> 37:54.473
but Walter was suspicious.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.942
I've never been able
to hide my feelings,

37:56.975 --> 38:02.581
so when the Delamars left,
he asked me point-blank.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.416
And I told him.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.586
And he was hurt,
and he was angry,

38:07.619 --> 38:11.623
and he said he was gonna go
see Sam over to his house,

38:11.657 --> 38:14.793
but when he got home, he said
that he couldn't face Sam,

38:14.826 --> 38:16.328
and he'd just left.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.063
And when you heard Sam was dead?

38:18.096 --> 38:21.933
Well, everyone said
that Ann killed him.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.469
The police, you.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.904
And if it wasn't that...

38:29.040 --> 38:31.477
(voice breaking): I couldn't
think it was my husband.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.479
I couldn't even imagine.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.354
Mr. Harris.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.694
We pledged to love each other.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.463
That mattered... to me.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.371
I guess I better
call a lawyer.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.556
Frank!

39:17.589 --> 39:18.924
I don't have you in my book.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.092
I'm not here to eat.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.731
There's two detectives
out back.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.734
If your partners have any brains
at all, they'll go outside,

39:28.767 --> 39:32.070
surrender themselves,
take the ride in and cooperate.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.806
Tell me what's going on.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.745
Anybody dumb enough to scam
the top cop's credit card,

39:39.778 --> 39:42.080
you don't want them
as partners anyway.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.555
Frank, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

39:49.588 --> 39:53.625
Well, we were both victims.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.097
Right?

40:03.201 --> 40:05.737
You know I have to ask.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.710
I had no idea.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.852
For my birthday,
let's shake it up a little...

40:20.886 --> 40:24.022
have a key lime pie
instead of a cake.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.207
(knocking on door)

40:42.240 --> 40:44.710
Hey.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.044
What's going on?

40:46.077 --> 40:49.247
Well, we dropped the charges
against Ann Delamar.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.118
Walter Harris is pleading to
manslaughter, heat of passion.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.521
Hm. Never really saw
that one coming.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.222
No, neither did I.

40:57.255 --> 41:00.592
I guess it was good
you were following a trail.

41:02.994 --> 41:06.131
Look, what happened in court,
what I said...

41:06.164 --> 41:08.033
I know.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.168
I was doing my job.

41:10.201 --> 41:13.171
I know you were.

41:13.204 --> 41:17.843
And, in my opinion,
you do it a little too good.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.083
Peace offering.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.521
To replace the one
I put in the microwave.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.595
(laughs)

41:36.628 --> 41:39.230
New hat...
All in one piece.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.869
You might want to put it on.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.203
It's cold outside.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.271
I'll give you a lift.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.310
Think quick.
