Seventy thousand dollars for this car

01:14.284 --> 01:15.492

Hello.

[whistles]

05:30.665 --> 05:33.793
What seems to be the problem here, officer?

06:23.134 --> 06:25.178
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.472
Sign there.

06:28.723 --> 06:30.390
Must be some party.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.642
Pardon me, officer?

06:32.435 --> 06:33.644
Just a joke.

06:43.071 --> 06:44.197
Thank you.

Better hurry.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.699
What do you mean, man?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.743
That was clockwork.
[chuckles]

07:31.744 --> 07:33.329
Better hurry.

07:41.212 --> 07:43.840
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck was that?

07:44.674 --> 07:45.967
A little insurance.

07:45.968 --> 07:47.009
What the hell for?

07:47.010 --> 07:49.178
No witnesses.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.188
<i>[male]
And when I told him the organization</i>

07:59.189 --> 08:02.065
<i>was simply not cost effective, he didn't listen.</i>

08:02.066 --> 08:05.694
<i>So, I felt the only way to exploit my talents</i>

08:05.695 --> 08:07.696
<i>was to branch out on my own.</i>

08:07.697 --> 08:10.449
- Mister...
- Davis.

08:10.450 --> 08:14.578
Davis, Davis, Davis, that's right--
Jeff Davis.

08:14.579 --> 08:15.996
My point is this...

08:15.997 --> 08:19.166
<i>Much like yourself I'm sure, at an early age,</i>

08:19.167 --> 08:23.086
<i>I envisioned that my education would be the saving grace.</i>

08:23.087 --> 08:25.881
<i>Give me that, um, necessary,
uh, here--</i>

08:25.882 --> 08:27.758
<i>Let me give you just one example.</i>

08:42.315 --> 08:45.275
I sensed the problem the minute I realized

08:45.276 --> 08:48.653
that MBAs were rapidly becoming a devalued commodity.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.739
<i>I got right back into Princeton</i>

08:50.740 --> 08:54.326
<i>and picked up a second masters in international banking,</i>

08:54.327 --> 08:56.078
which I suppose
is the field I've ended up--

08:56.079 --> 08:57.997
Hey, what's with all the extra muscle?

08:57.998 --> 08:59.873
Evening, Mr. Manning.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.833
Just think of them as couriers.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.920
<i>Yeah, right, let's see what you got.</i>

09:18.601 --> 09:19.602
Come on, guys.

09:27.026 --> 09:28.652
Education.

09:28.653 --> 09:30.613
- <i>It's really so important.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

09:30.614 --> 09:32.782
- Can I just call you Jeff?
- Yeah, well, whatever.

- <i>Come on, come on.</i>

09:39.622 --> 09:41.415
<i>a guy could become desperate.</i>

09:42.041 --> 09:44.000
Might have to join the army.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.628
Turn to a life of crime.

09:47.797 --> 09:49.214
Or become a cop.

09:49.215 --> 09:50.966
<i>[laughing]</i>

09:50.967 --> 09:53.177
Why don't we just cut the crap, man,
and get down to business?

09:53.178 --> 09:55.053
What university did you attend?

09:55.054 --> 09:57.223
The university of suck my dick.

You got the money, man?

11:09.670 --> 11:10.962
You done?

11:10.963 --> 11:12.298
Buzz...

11:13.215 --> 11:14.467
You're not Buzz.

11:14.468 --> 11:16.259
And you're not very smart.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.803
You cops think you're so smart.

11:18.804 --> 11:22.057
You ought to know better than to mess
with me and my White Boys.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.267
Drop it.

11:25.978 --> 11:28.647
<i>We've been on to your pathetic charade for a week.</i>

11:32.026 --> 11:33.319
<i>I said drop it!</i>

11:35.696 --> 11:37.490
What the fuck is he talking about, huh?

11:38.366 --> 11:40.283
Smile, Ray.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.035
<i>Drop it now!</i>

11:51.545 --> 11:53.380
Pack it up, gentlemen.

11:53.381 --> 11:54.714
Yes, sir.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.383
Who set this up anyway?

11:56.384 --> 11:57.551
I don't know, sir.

11:57.552 --> 11:59.261
<i>If it was Warren, he should know better.</i>

11:59.262 --> 12:01.013
At least now there's one less cop in the world.

12:01.014 --> 12:03.932
You boys be sure to pick up every grain of that heroin.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.392

12:05.393 --> 12:07.477
Yes, sir, Mr. Manning.
Let's go!

Come on.

12:11.941 --> 12:13.442
I come in peace.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.043
What the fuck?

12:32.044 --> 12:33.170
Merry Christmas.

12:33.171 --> 12:34.504
Keep an eye on him.

12:34.505 --> 12:35.673
You bet.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.681
Son of a bitch!

Come on!

13:42.281 --> 13:43.574
[whispers]
Shit.

13:49.705 --> 13:50.873
I'm gonna kill him!

13:50.874 --> 13:53.333
I'm gonna fuckin' tear his face off!

13:53.334 --> 13:55.336
[ranting]

13:59.465 --> 14:02.300
We got confirmation on the federal warehouse explosion.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.428
Nine dead and at least half a dozen others injured.

14:04.429 --> 14:05.512
Lovely.

14:05.513 --> 14:07.723
Would you give us some information.
[clamoring]

14:17.775 --> 14:18.984
- Hi, Diane.
- Hi.

14:18.985 --> 14:20.903
- What's going on?
- Slaughterhouse.

14:20.904 --> 14:22.988
Looks like the White Boys went through a Cuisinart.

14:22.989 --> 14:25.573
Jesus, what the hell happened?

14:25.574 --> 14:26.783
Five dead.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.618
Nobody saw or heard anything.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.579
That's nothin' new for this part of town.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.248
Caine was the first one
on the scene at 11:32,

14:33.249 --> 14:34.917
but he didn't see anything either.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.467
Jack, I'm sorry about Turner.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.261
I really am.

14:48.597 --> 14:52.308
I'm so pissed off, I could throw you
through a God damn window!

14:52.309 --> 14:54.686
I'm not going to do that right now.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.313
This is not the time.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.233
This is not the time to break your fucking neck either!

15:00.234 --> 15:01.902
I know how you must feel about Ray.

15:01.903 --> 15:03.362
What about Victor Manning?

15:03.363 --> 15:05.489
- Well, what about him?
- He killed my God damn partner!

15:05.490 --> 15:07.156
Don't push me, Jack!

15:07.157 --> 15:09.450
You disappeared for eight days.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.578
Not even a week, which maybe I could understand.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.163
But eight fuckin' days?

15:15.207 --> 15:16.749
<i>On top of all that,</i>

15:16.750 --> 15:18.960
<i>you gotta answer for the stolen heroin.</i>

15:18.961 --> 15:20.670
<i>Plus the 500 grand!</i>

15:20.671 --> 15:22.380
Captain Malone,

15:22.381 --> 15:23.965
there's somebody here to see you.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.342
Oh, great-- feds.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.095
Their warehouse blows
and they figure they got jurisdiction

15:29.096 --> 15:31.097
over the whole fucking town!

15:31.098 --> 15:35.435
Tell 'em-- just tell 'em
<i>I'll</i> be right there, okay?

15:35.436 --> 15:36.645
Yes, sir.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.773
All right, you're off it.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.859
You got eight weeks
vacation coming-- take it.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.736
All of it.

15:44.737 --> 15:46.404
Is that an order?

15:46.405 --> 15:49.157
No... worse.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.742
Promise me.

15:50.743 --> 15:54.829
Caine, you're the only man I know
who'd rather die than break his word.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.665
So, promise me, and that's an order.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.375
I want Manning.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.838
Take the vacation or I'll make it permanent.

16:07.426 --> 16:08.385
Fine.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.930
Good.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.643
Oh, and, uh, if I were you,

16:16.644 --> 16:19.772
I'd take a little time and patch up my personal life too.

16:30.616 --> 16:34.869
Detective Caine, this is Agent Switzer of the FBI.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.580
He'd like to ask you a few questions.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.958
In private.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.176
[flushing]

16:54.431 --> 16:56.350
Do you know what I do, Detective?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.852
I know things.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.355
That's all, it's my whole job.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.982
I know things before anyone else.

17:03.983 --> 17:05.023
$0?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.777
I know you were after Victor Manning.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.656
I also know that these are no ordinary murders.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.951
Three well armed men had their throats cut

17:14.952 --> 17:16.328
before they could even draw their weapons.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.621
Now, who could possibly move that fast?

17:18.622 --> 17:20.623
Not who, what.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.165
I've seen a lot of knife wounds,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.502
but Manning's boys were killed by something else.

17:24.503 --> 17:25.713
Something different.

17:25.714 --> 17:28.257
- Do you think the weapon's a key?
- Yes, I do.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.511
You wouldn't happen to know where I could locate

17:32.512 --> 17:34.304
your Mr. Manning, would you?
I'd like a word with him.

17:34.305 --> 17:38.266
Look, I'd like to help, but I was just put on vacation.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.936
Or, uh, didn't you know that?

17:45.983 --> 17:47.775
Put Caine back on the case.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.111
Like hell I will.

17:51.989 --> 17:54.575
I'd have to make one phone call, just one.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.870
You don't want that.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.207
Well, Caine can't, he's going on vacation.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.584
Isn't that right, Caine?

18:04.585 --> 18:06.628
Well, I said I'd go, I didn't say when.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.507
Fine, you heard him, you're on it.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.592
Good.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.887
I'll send his partner over from the Bureau tomorrow.

18:16.472 --> 18:17.764
Partner?

18:17.765 --> 18:20.308
- <i>Partner?</i>
- <i>Caine, meet Special Agent Smith.</i>

18:20.309 --> 18:21.477
You're kiddin', right?

18:21.478 --> 18:22.561
Cool it, Caine.

18:22.562 --> 18:24.645
[chuckles]
I can handle this, Captain.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.481
Excuse me, Mr. Caine.

18:26.482 --> 18:29.108
I'm the youngest man ever to reach my rank at the Bureau.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.819
And I make twice as much as you do
and it's for a good reason.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.238
So, don't even start that shit with me.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.115
You are kidding.

18:35.116 --> 18:37.826
You may not be accustomed to working
on a case under federal jurisdiction,

18:37.827 --> 18:39.411
so Commander Switzer has asked me to lay out

18:39.412 --> 18:40.662
some parameters for your cooperation.

18:40.663 --> 18:41.705
- Parameters?
- Yes.

18:41.706 --> 18:44.290
Parameters are sort
of general guidelines--

18:44.291 --> 18:45.751
I know what the word means.

18:45.752 --> 18:46.919
Well, good.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.796
We will report to Inspector Switzer daily.

to say about the murder weapon?

Whatever it was, it was razor thin and razor sharp.

19:16.907 --> 19:20.118

I'd have trouble making with a scalpel.

I gotta relax.

39:24.030 --> 39:25.822
Extra caffeine.

39:25.823 --> 39:28.409
Lousy American coffee couldn't keep
a hamster up at night.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.369
Who's the suit?

39:31.370 --> 39:33.998
Oh, Smith, here, he's a real live FBI agent.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.666
Caine, are you nuts?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.792
Relax, Dr. Bruce,
I'm not here for that.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.004
Every thing I have in here is essential to my research.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.504

39:41.505 --> 39:44.883
Sure, sure, you feds are all alike.

39:44.884 --> 39:47.344
You're just like that tribe in Africa.

40:10.994 --> 40:12.952
Relax, G-man.

40:12.953 --> 40:16.247
In a field completely void of charge
like the one I've created,

40:16.248 --> 40:17.500
it simply hovers.

40:17.501 --> 40:20.210
<i>In simplest terms, it's a magnet.</i>

40:20.211 --> 40:24.089
<i>The most powerful self-contained
electromagnet I have ever seen.</i>

40:24.090 --> 40:26.216
<i>And like any magnet, it can be attracted</i>

40:26.217 --> 40:28.010
<i>to other magnets of reverse polarity.</i>

40:28.011 --> 40:29.645
<i>[Smith]
That's why it stuck to the speaker magnet.</i>

40:30.054 --> 40:33.640
It can be programmed to use other magnetic forces

40:33.641 --> 40:35.184
as a means of propulsion.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.770
You can use any frequency you want.

40:38.396 --> 40:39.979
So, how's it used as a weapon?

40:39.980 --> 40:42.607
The human body carries a small electrical charge, right?

40:42.608 --> 40:45.027
You tune the disc
to the charge and then--

40:45.736 --> 40:47.946
Flat head's basically correct.

40:47.947 --> 40:52.867
It's like turning
your radio dial to K-I-L-L.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.161
The technology is incredible.

40:55.162 --> 40:56.580
I need more time to study it.

Fine, keep it, we'll be back.

<i>Forget it, you've had your chance.</i>

40:58.750 --> 41:00.376
I'm taking that thing to Switzer right now.

41:00.377 --> 41:01.710
Are you crazy, the God damn thing

41:01.711 --> 41:04.046
almost took my head off twice
and I'm know what I'm doing!

41:04.047 --> 41:05.214
You can't take it.

41:05.215 --> 41:06.632
[chuckles]
Oh really, I can't take it?

41:06.633 --> 41:08.174
You wouldn't get ten feet.

41:36.663 --> 41:39.330
Cause of death--
massive heroin overdose.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.874
And this guy was no addict.

41:40.875 --> 41:41.834
Look-

41:42.918 --> 41:44.962
it's definitely not self-induced.

41:45.671 --> 41:46.839
Was it the fed's heroin?

41:46.840 --> 41:47.965
I think so.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.009
The potency was incredible.

41:50.468 --> 41:53.512
Your psycho stole a lot of heroin to kill people with.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.266
Why? I mean...
why would he do that?

41:58.267 --> 42:00.519
People do a lot of sick things to each other.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.023
<i>What about the bullet hole?</i>

53:48.018 --> 53:50.478
<i>[female on PA]
William Springer, report to your office.</i>

53:50.479 --> 53:52.605
You're gonna think
I'm crazy, but--

53:52.606 --> 53:54.191
Oh, no, no, don't let that stop you.

53:54.192 --> 53:55.525
It hasn't-- it hasn't yet,
you know.

53:57.402 --> 53:59.613
<i>[PA] John Weber, telephone.</i>

54:01.865 --> 54:04.366
I think we're dealing with aliens and not from Mexico.

54:04.367 --> 54:05.493
There are two of them.

54:05.494 --> 54:08.787
One's the killer and I think the other one's on our side.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.498
[sighs]
Let me tell you something.

54:10.499 --> 54:12.208
You work very hard.

54:12.209 --> 54:15.002
Your mind and body require rest or they break down.

54:15.003 --> 54:16.587
It's only natural.

54:16.588 --> 54:18.048
I need you to listen to me.

54:18.049 --> 54:19.591
You need a psychiatrist, Jack.

54:22.594 --> 54:24.803
Look, somebody had to be the first.

54:24.804 --> 54:26.555
First what, huh?

54:26.556 --> 54:28.515
First person to see aliens, huh?

54:28.516 --> 54:30.893
[chuckles]
You don't have any proof.

54:30.894 --> 54:32.645
No one's gonna believe it.

54:32.646 --> 54:34.189
I got the disc.

54:35.941 --> 54:37.150
<i>Come on.</i>

54:45.909 --> 54:46.952
Bruce?

54:54.334 --> 54:55.293
Jesus.

54:59.547 --> 55:00.674
What happened?

55:03.802 --> 55:05.344
What do you think happened?

55:05.345 --> 55:07.263
Bastards stole the disc.

55:07.264 --> 55:08.639
Your pal.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.517
I knew something like this was going to happen.

55:10.518 --> 55:11.725
God damn it!

55:11.726 --> 55:13.227
I tried to lie.

55:13.228 --> 55:14.395
I swear it.

55:14.396 --> 55:15.605
<i>They knew I had it.</i>

55:16.648 --> 55:18.191
[sighs]
Are you all right?

55:18.692 --> 55:20.234
Feel like I look.

55:20.235 --> 55:21.319
You look like shit.

55:21.736 --> 55:23.445
Look who's talkin'.

55:23.446 --> 55:24.947
Do you know who they were?

55:24.948 --> 55:26.283
I don't know.

55:27.158 --> 55:29.828
Troglodytes with bad haircuts.

55:31.579 --> 55:33.290
Looked like you, actually.

55:34.332 --> 55:35.500
Why don't you shut up.

55:35.917 --> 55:38.336
Terrific, it's our one piece of evidence and it's gone.

55:39.921 --> 55:41.423
What are you lookin' at?

55:47.053 --> 55:48.387
We're going to Malone.

55:48.388 --> 55:50.723
Oh. [chuckles]
it's you're career, you go ahead.

55:50.724 --> 55:53.350
What are you going to do,
tell him we're fighting drug dealers

55:53.351 --> 55:55.687
from outer space, huh?
[chuckles]

56:09.409 --> 56:12.703
No shit, man, he had to be at least seven feet tall.

56:12.704 --> 56:14.788
I saw him about two blocks down the street.

56:14.789 --> 56:15.999
Yeah, sure you did.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.751
Last week you saw Jimi Hendrix
at the Laundromat, remember?

56:18.752 --> 56:21.170
Right, with a drier full
of tie-dyed shirts.

56:21.171 --> 56:22.881
Man, no shit, there's a crazy motherfucker

56:22.882 --> 56:23.923
runnin' around the place.

56:23.924 --> 56:25.549
Don't you all ever read the news?

56:25.550 --> 56:27.718
- Aw, shit.
- Hey, just stay cool.

56:27.719 --> 56:30.055
[whispers]
That's him, that's the guy.

56:33.767 --> 56:34.850
Hey.

56:34.851 --> 56:35.894
I come in peace.

56:35.895 --> 56:38.229
Yeah, sure you do, tall guy.
What are you a politician?

56:38.230 --> 56:39.189
Hey, leave him alone!

56:41.024 --> 56:42.692
Shit, what the fuck are you doin', man?

57:11.930 --> 57:13.556
[yells]

57:23.149 --> 57:24.943

57:38.832 --> 57:40.375
You're gonna back me up on this, right?

57:40.376 --> 57:41.959
Absolutely.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.002
- Promise.
- No problem.

57:44.003 --> 57:45.212
Say What?

57:45.213 --> 57:47.673
I agree with you, sir, I agree with you 100%.

57:47.674 --> 57:49.968
I think Detective Caine is jumping to conclusions.

57:49.969 --> 57:51.428
- Now--
- You spineless son of a bitch.

57:51.429 --> 57:52.887
Do you do this to test me, Jack?

57:52.888 --> 57:55.722
- It's true!
- Well then bring me some proof.

57:55.723 --> 57:57.434
What about that disc you say you found?

57:57.435 --> 57:58.601
Somebody stole it!

57:58.602 --> 57:59.894
- Yeah, sure.
- Might be Switzer.

58:00.770 --> 58:02.897
Malone here.
Yep.

58:03.314 --> 58:04.690
What?

58:04.691 --> 58:05.942
Where?

58:07.652 --> 58:08.903

58:10.113 --> 58:11.405
Yeah.

58:11.406 --> 58:12.573

58:12.574 --> 58:15.909
Your boy just killed two more people
at a downtown market.

58:15.910 --> 58:17.453
This time we have a witness.

58:17.454 --> 58:21.291
Dee, tell Harper, Borland, and Mulroney
to meet me at this address, right now.

58:22.792 --> 58:23.876
Thanks.

58:23.877 --> 58:25.086
I've got a career to think about.

58:25.087 --> 58:26.337
I can't afford to start telling stories

58:26.338 --> 58:27.589

58:27.590 --> 58:29.674
If you can't help, just stay the hell out of my way!

58:29.675 --> 58:31.301
- Inspector Switzer says--
- That's two!

58:35.013 --> 58:36.055

- Oh, Jack, thank God.

- Asshole?

59:27.982 --> 59:30.609
Thank you.
This asshole won't let me in.

59:30.610 --> 59:31.945
There are corpses in there.

59:31.946 --> 59:33.404
Reports are being made out in my name

- I'll handle this, please.

Smith, FBI.

01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:14.612

There is no witness.
Now, listen to me, don't talk.

"taken care of?"

Great, that's our proof.

All we gotta do is take it
to Malone and--

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.170
Wait a second, Inspector Switzer has to be informed.

01:06:04.171 --> 01:06:05.338
He has to see it first.

01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:06.964
- Forget Switzer.
- You want to stop this thing?

01:06:06.965 --> 01:06:08.925

No.

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.985
Well, suffice it to say that

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:54.529
this will be applied to the national interest.

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.407
Well, that's, that's something
I, I wanted to talk to you about, sir.

01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:58.908
I won't ask you to remove Caine.

01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:56.710
Your one clear shot.

01:20:02.466 --> 01:20:04.009
I'm right behind you, hurry!

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:18.774
There he is, there he is.

01:20:18.775 --> 01:20:21.193
Okay, let's push this
all the way to four. [beeps]

01:20:24.362 --> 01:20:25.530
Perfect.

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.449
Come on, come on.

01:20:30.952 --> 01:20:32.329
[Diane]
He's going for it.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.673
No!

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:46.509
Lights out.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.512
[clicks]

01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:50.555
- Fuck!

01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:53.433
Smith, it's empty, come on, let's get outta here!

01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:57.812
No!

01:20:57.813 --> 01:20:58.855
Get outta here!

01:20:58.856 --> 01:20:59.856
- Jack!
- Come on!

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:04.903
Move, move, move!

01:21:16.248 --> 01:21:17.749
Go, go, go, go!

01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:20.877
Hurry!

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:26.925
[roars]

01:21:55.161 --> 01:21:56.663
What are you doing?
Come on, come on!

01:21:56.664 --> 01:21:57.998
- Jack!

01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:25.358
Come on, let's go!
Move it!

01:22:29.487 --> 01:22:30.655
Come on, let's go.

01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:35.619
Watch yourself.

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:40.080
Hold it.

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:41.541
[roars]

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:52.469
Let her go.

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:57.974
I said let her go!

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:05.522
[roars]

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:06.900
[screams]

01:25:17.781 --> 01:25:18.782
Uh!

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:38.528
Iwin!

01:26:41.156 --> 01:26:42.949
Fuck you, spaceman.

01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:45.284
[yells]

01:26:45.285 --> 01:26:46.911

01:26:58.006 --> 01:26:59.966
[yells]

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:10.560

01:27:17.775 --> 01:27:18.985
Smith!

01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:24.573
Come here.
Are you all right?

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:26.576
[groans]
Let me at him.

01:27:37.337 --> 01:27:40.047
I come in peace.

01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:42.050
[beeps]

01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:47.847
And you go in pieces, asshole.

01:27:56.231 --> 01:27:57.397
Jack!

01:27:57.398 --> 01:27:58.524
Come on!

01:28:01.778 --> 01:28:02.987
Hell of a night, huh?

01:28:02.988 --> 01:28:04.780
Yeah, ow, ow!

01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:06.281
Glad I softened him up for you.

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:07.492
Yeah, nice work, Smith.

01:28:08.201 --> 01:28:09.786
What the hell is your first name, anyway?

01:28:09.787 --> 01:28:11.162
<i>- Atwood.

01:28:11.163 --> 01:28:12.997
<i>Atwood--

01:28:12.998 --> 01:28:14.706
Uh-huh, nice work, Smith.

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:17.084
Can we please go on vacation now?

01:28:17.085 --> 01:28:18.669
I promised, didn't I?

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:20.379
Where are we going, anyway?

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.673
Well, I was thinkin' of Rio.

01:28:22.674 --> 01:28:24.508
