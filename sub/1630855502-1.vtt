-Oh, nothing.

20:35.703 --> 20:39.540
A really fun game
of volleyball.

20:39.574 --> 20:42.442
-That's it?
-Thoughts of death.

20:42.476 --> 20:43.443
What is it?

20:45.312 --> 20:47.882
[stammers]
Maybe some thoughts
of death?

20:47.915 --> 20:49.751
Thoughts of death!

20:49.784 --> 20:51.853
-Is that a problem?
-Oh.

20:51.886 --> 20:53.688
-What?
-I've heard of this.

20:53.721 --> 20:56.624
Of course, I didn't think
it was possible, but it's real.

20:58.526 --> 21:00.862
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal.

21:00.895 --> 21:02.897
I didn't open a portal.

21:02.930 --> 21:06.634
[chuckles] Someone did.
And now, there is a rip
in the continuum

21:06.667 --> 21:09.570
that is the membrane between
Barbie Land and the Real World,

21:09.604 --> 21:11.806
and if you wanna be
Stereotypical Barbie
perfect again,

21:11.839 --> 21:13.775
then, baby girl,
you gotta go fix it.

21:13.808 --> 21:17.745
Or you're gonna keep
going funny.
Look at your upper thigh.

21:17.779 --> 21:19.814
-[gasps] What is that?
-That's cellulite.

21:19.847 --> 21:21.883
-That's gonna
spread everywhere.
-What?

21:21.916 --> 21:24.819
And then you're gonna
start getting sad
and mushy and complicated.

21:24.852 --> 21:26.353
-No!
-[hisses]

21:26.386 --> 21:27.588
What do I have to do?

21:27.622 --> 21:29.489
You have to go

21:29.524 --> 21:31.092
-to the Real World.
-Okay.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.360
And you have to find the girl
who's playing with you.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.629
Playing with me?

21:34.662 --> 21:36.396
We're all being played with,
babe.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.465
But usually there's some kind
of separation. Thanks.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.836
There's the girl and the doll.
And never the twain
shall cross.

21:41.869 --> 21:43.771
-The twain is crossing?
-Yes.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.907
And the girl who's playing
with you, she must be sad,

21:45.940 --> 21:47.875
and her thoughts and feelings
and humanness

21:47.909 --> 21:50.044
are interfering
with your dollness.

21:50.077 --> 21:51.879
Why would she be sad?

21:51.913 --> 21:54.715
We fixed everything so that
all women in the Real World

21:54.749 --> 21:56.083
can be happy and powerful.

21:56.117 --> 21:57.852
I don't know,
but if you ask me,

21:57.885 --> 21:59.787
-you had something
to do with this, too.
-Me?

21:59.821 --> 22:01.589
-Takes two to rip a portal.
-I can't have.

22:01.622 --> 22:02.890
I've only ever wanted

22:02.924 --> 22:04.826
for everything
to stay exactly as it is.

22:04.859 --> 22:06.561
Well, be that as it may,

22:06.594 --> 22:09.697
the two of you are becoming
inextricably intertwined.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.732
And you gotta help her
to help yourself.

22:14.802 --> 22:17.839
[girls' voices echoing faintly]

22:17.872 --> 22:19.140
So, should-- Whoo!

22:19.173 --> 22:20.775
So, what'll it be then?

22:20.808 --> 22:22.375
You can go
back to your regular life

22:22.409 --> 22:23.945
and forget any of this
ever happened,

22:23.978 --> 22:26.881
or you can know the truth
about the universe.

22:27.882 --> 22:31.152
The choice is now yours.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.987
The first one. The high heel.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.990
No. We'll do a re-do.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.124
You're supposed to
want to know.

22:37.158 --> 22:38.593
I don't.

22:38.626 --> 22:40.027
Mmm. Babe, listen.

22:40.061 --> 22:41.896
You have to want to know, okay?
Do it again.

22:41.929 --> 22:44.165
I'm not Adventure Barbie.
I'm Stereotypical Barbie.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.700
I'm like the Barbie
you think of

22:45.733 --> 22:47.434
when someone says,
"Think of a Barbie."

22:47.969 --> 22:49.804
That's me.

22:49.837 --> 22:52.807
I'm bummed. You're a bummer.
That's a bummer.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.876
Okay, I'm ready to forget now.

22:54.909 --> 22:57.410
No! You're doing this one!

22:57.444 --> 23:00.114
I just gave you a choice
so you could feel
some sense of control.

23:00.147 --> 23:02.116
-So there is no option one?
-No!

23:02.149 --> 23:05.485
You have to fix the rip
yourself.

23:05.519 --> 23:07.188
Don't blame me, blame Mattel.
They make the rules.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.456
[whining] Oh, I don't want to.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.925

I don't care.

No. Okay. Yeah.

23:13.895 --> 23:14.896

23:16.463 --> 23:18.966
Send me through the portal.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.568
Okay.
There's actually no portal.

23:20.601 --> 23:21.969
-Oh.
-It's a figure of speech.

23:22.003 --> 23:24.705
It's actually a sports car
to a speedboat,

23:24.739 --> 23:27.474
to a rocket ship,
to a tandem bike,

23:27.508 --> 23:30.011
to a camper van, fun,
to a snowmobile, brr,

23:30.044 --> 23:31.579
which will take you
most of the way

23:31.612 --> 23:33.080
to the state of Los Angeles,

23:33.114 --> 23:35.082
where you will don neon
and Rollerblades,

23:35.116 --> 23:37.652
and enter
the country of California.

23:37.685 --> 23:39.887
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much.

23:39.921 --> 23:42.623
And then when I get there,
how do I find this girl?

23:43.557 --> 23:45.526
You will know.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.795
Okay. And how do I get back?

23:47.828 --> 23:49.697
The same way you came,
but in reverse.

23:49.730 --> 23:52.600

do the order backward or go--

23:52.633 --> 23:54.602
-Don't overthink it.
-Oh. Okay.

23:54.635 --> 23:58.839
For you see, if you do not
find her and fix things,

23:58.873 --> 24:00.775
what's ugly will become uglier,

24:00.808 --> 24:02.710
and what's weird
will become weirder.

24:02.743 --> 24:04.612
And then you'll look like me.

24:04.645 --> 24:05.813
Ahh! Oh.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.716
Sorry.

24:08.749 --> 24:10.918

I set myself up for that.

"I prefer to stay here."

-No.

even want you to go.

both those things incorrectly,

You're a Nobel Prize winner?

39:53.828 --> 39:57.531
Oh. No, not me,
but Barbie is.

39:57.565 --> 39:59.466
Yeah.

39:59.499 --> 40:02.603
Aren't you guys gonna thank me
and give me a big hug? [laughs]

40:04.205 --> 40:06.473
For being your favorite toy?

40:06.507 --> 40:09.476
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were
like five years old.

40:09.510 --> 40:11.444
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

40:11.478 --> 40:13.480
I mean, I'd play with Barbie,
but it was, like,
the last resort.

40:13.514 --> 40:14.749
I loved Barbie.

40:14.782 --> 40:16.751
-[clears throat]
-Oh.

40:16.784 --> 40:19.053
Anyways, even then,
it was horrible for us.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.154
It was horrible?

40:21.722 --> 40:22.990
Why?

40:23.024 --> 40:24.225
-Come on, Sasha.
-Give it to her.

40:24.258 --> 40:25.826
Destroy Barbie.

40:25.860 --> 40:26.861
[sighs]

40:26.894 --> 40:30.598
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

40:30.631 --> 40:33.834
You've been making women
feel bad about themselves
since you were invented.

40:33.868 --> 40:35.703
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

40:35.736 --> 40:38.139
You represent everything wrong
with our culture.

40:38.172 --> 40:41.676
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

40:41.709 --> 40:44.912
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

40:44.946 --> 40:47.915
Barbie is so much more
than that.

40:47.949 --> 40:50.151
Look at yourself.

40:50.184 --> 40:53.120
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

40:53.154 --> 40:55.756
You set the feminist movement
back 50 years.

40:55.790 --> 40:57.825
You destroy
girls' innate sense of worth

40:57.858 --> 40:59.527
and you are killing the planet

40:59.560 --> 41:01.562
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

41:01.595 --> 41:05.766
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy
and powerful.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.635
Oh, I am powerful.

41:07.668 --> 41:09.770
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

41:09.804 --> 41:12.106
I hadn't thought about you
in years, you fascist!

41:16.310 --> 41:18.112
Oh. Um...

41:19.013 --> 41:20.614
Okay.

41:20.648 --> 41:23.017
It's happening again.
[laughing] I have to--

41:23.050 --> 41:24.885
Will you excuse me?

41:24.919 --> 41:27.154
It was really nice
talking to you.

41:34.328 --> 41:35.863
They never listen.

41:49.810 --> 41:51.579
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

41:52.313 --> 41:53.814
You respect me.

41:53.848 --> 41:55.850
Sorry, no,
do you know what time it is?

41:56.684 --> 41:58.119
No, I do not.

41:58.152 --> 41:59.720
[laughs]

41:59.754 --> 42:01.022
Okay.

42:01.055 --> 42:02.623
Why didn't Barbie tell me
about patriarchy,

42:02.656 --> 42:03.991
which, to my understanding,

42:04.025 --> 42:06.627
is where men and horses
run everything?

42:06.660 --> 42:08.062
Sure.

42:08.095 --> 42:09.897
I shall seek my fortune there.

42:09.930 --> 42:12.933
All right. So...

42:12.967 --> 42:15.669
I'll take a high-level,
high-paying job
with influence, please.

42:15.703 --> 42:16.971
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

42:17.004 --> 42:18.606
And a lot of our people
have PhDs.

42:18.639 --> 42:20.074
Isn't being a man enough?

42:20.107 --> 42:21.842
Actually, right now,
it's kind of the opposite.

42:21.876 --> 42:24.779
You guys are clearly not doing
patriarchy very well.

42:24.812 --> 42:27.848
[laughing] No!
No. We're, uh...

42:27.882 --> 42:31.252
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just... hide it better now.

42:31.285 --> 42:33.187
Oh.

42:33.220 --> 42:36.757
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

42:36.791 --> 42:38.159
-But I'm a man.
-But not a doctor.

42:38.192 --> 42:39.894
-Please?
-No.

42:39.927 --> 42:41.328
-Can I talk to a doctor?
-You are talking to a doctor.

42:41.362 --> 42:42.897
-Can you get me a coffee?
-No.

42:42.930 --> 42:43.964
-And I need a clicky pen.
-No.

42:43.998 --> 42:45.066
-And a white coat.
-No.

42:45.099 --> 42:46.734
-And a sharp thing.
-No.

42:46.767 --> 42:48.035
-There he is. Doctor!
-Somebody get security.

42:48.069 --> 42:50.237
I'd like to apply
for your job of beach.

42:50.271 --> 42:51.906
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

42:51.939 --> 42:54.375
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

42:54.408 --> 42:56.710
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

42:56.744 --> 42:58.345
There's nobody in danger here.

42:58.379 --> 43:00.781
And even if there were,
I'm not trained to save them.

43:00.815 --> 43:02.083
-[chuckles]
-Then I can't hire you.

43:02.116 --> 43:04.018
I can't even beach here!

43:06.253 --> 43:08.222
[sobbing]

43:08.255 --> 43:10.724
She thinks I'm a fascist?

43:10.758 --> 43:14.862
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

43:15.696 --> 43:17.231
[sobs]

43:17.264 --> 43:18.666
-There you are.
-Oh, no.

43:18.699 --> 43:20.367
That went terrible.

43:20.401 --> 43:23.904
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

43:27.708 --> 43:28.776
Miss Barbie?

43:28.809 --> 43:30.144
[sniffling] It's just Barbie.

43:30.177 --> 43:31.912
We're gonna need you
to come with us.

43:31.946 --> 43:33.914
Oh.

43:33.948 --> 43:35.716
-Who are you?
-We're Mattel.

43:35.749 --> 43:37.418
-Mattel?
-Mattel.

43:37.451 --> 43:39.220
Oh, thank goodness!

43:39.253 --> 43:41.255
I've gotta talk
to somebody in charge.

43:41.288 --> 43:42.857
Everything is backwards here.

43:42.890 --> 43:44.725
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

43:44.758 --> 43:46.327
Girls hate me.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.662
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

43:48.696 --> 43:49.930
Need you to step this way,
ma'am.

43:49.964 --> 43:51.699
I also just learned to cry.

43:51.732 --> 43:53.801
First, I got one tear
and then I got a whole bunch.

43:53.834 --> 43:55.402
What do I do?
Do I follow Barbie

43:55.436 --> 43:58.172
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

43:58.205 --> 44:01.075
A truck car
I'd like to have, actually.

44:01.108 --> 44:04.078
You're right, she's fine.
It's Mattel.

44:04.111 --> 44:06.247
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-I know.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.149
I'll go back to Barbie Land,
and I'll tell the Kens
what I've learned.

44:08.182 --> 44:09.383
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

44:09.416 --> 44:10.384
[chuckles]

44:10.417 --> 44:11.986
Okay.

44:12.019 --> 44:13.220
-Back to Barbie Land.
-Let's go that way.

44:14.755 --> 44:16.690
-Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
-Don't call me that.

44:16.724 --> 44:19.293
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

44:19.326 --> 44:22.096
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

44:22.129 --> 44:24.732
Thank God
they arrested that nutjob.

44:24.765 --> 44:25.933
Um, um...

44:25.966 --> 44:28.135
that reality-challenged woman.

44:28.169 --> 44:29.336
She thinks she's Barbie.

44:29.370 --> 44:31.071
Wait, what did you say?

44:31.105 --> 44:33.908
She thinks she's Barbie.
She's, like, fully convinced.

44:33.941 --> 44:35.276
[gasps]

44:35.309 --> 44:37.211
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

44:37.244 --> 44:38.913
Mom. Mom!

44:39.880 --> 44:41.849
Mom, get back in the car!

44:43.751 --> 44:45.052
Are you kidding me?

44:46.820 --> 44:47.821
Mom!

44:49.957 --> 44:53.460
Mattel! Of course it was
you guys that brought me here.

44:53.494 --> 44:56.764
Because it definitely wasn't
that Sasha girl.

44:56.797 --> 44:59.033
Thanks for the ride.
This has been so much fun.

44:59.066 --> 45:02.203
[gasps]
Wow, the mothership!

-We're so happy to see you.

45:09.343 --> 45:11.478
-Hi!
-[man] Would you like
some mineral water?

45:11.513 --> 45:12.947
Yes, thank you.

45:12.980 --> 45:14.215
Oh, thanks.

45:16.917 --> 45:18.919
I'm not used to that
having anything in it.

45:18.953 --> 45:20.955
[men laughing]

45:22.856 --> 45:24.992
[Barbie] Thank you.

45:25.025 --> 45:27.061
So, we've been very anxious
to get some quality
face-time with you.

45:27.094 --> 45:28.530
Of course.
So what can I do

45:28.563 --> 45:30.931
to repair the rift
in the space-time continuum,

45:30.965 --> 45:32.833
get my feet back,
and that one cellulite gone,

45:32.866 --> 45:35.369
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

45:35.402 --> 45:38.806
We have been discussing
that very topic.

45:38.839 --> 45:41.308
If you're agreeable to it,
we would love it

45:41.342 --> 45:44.979
if you could just get
into that giant box.

45:48.015 --> 45:49.950
Get into the box and you'll go
back to Barbie Land.

45:49.984 --> 45:52.353
And everything will be
as it was.

45:52.386 --> 45:54.955
You know what? We should
probably get Ken first.

45:54.989 --> 45:56.123
-Ken?
-[confused chatter]

45:56.156 --> 45:57.191
Ken.

45:57.224 --> 45:58.560
You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken.

45:58.593 --> 46:00.127
[chuckles] Oh!

46:00.160 --> 46:02.396
-Yes, Ken. Yeah.
-Ken. The guy. Yeah.

46:02.429 --> 46:04.298
[panting]

46:04.331 --> 46:07.502
Back to Barbie Land!
[laughs]

46:07.535 --> 46:10.070
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick. [retches]

46:10.104 --> 46:12.873
Ken isn't something
we're worried about.

46:13.941 --> 46:15.342
Ever.

46:15.376 --> 46:17.444
Okay, I'll just, um...
I'll get in the box then.

46:17.478 --> 46:18.812
All right! Yes!

46:18.846 --> 46:20.114
[applauding]

46:20.147 --> 46:22.449
Oh. But since I came
all this way,

46:22.483 --> 46:24.451
could I just meet
the woman in charge,

46:24.485 --> 46:26.453
your CEO?

46:26.487 --> 46:28.088
Oh, that would be me.

46:28.122 --> 46:29.390
-Oh. Your CFO.
-Me.

46:29.423 --> 46:30.924
-Your COO.
-Here.

46:30.958 --> 46:32.092
President
of the Barbie division.

46:32.126 --> 46:33.360
-Present.
-I'm a man with no power.

46:33.394 --> 46:35.496
Does that make me a woman?

46:35.530 --> 46:37.965
Are any women in charge?

46:37.998 --> 46:41.435
Listen, I know exactly
where you're going with this,

46:41.468 --> 46:44.138
and I have to say
I really resent it.

46:44.171 --> 46:47.007
We are a company
literally made of women.

46:47.041 --> 46:49.443
We had a woman CEO in the '90s.

46:49.476 --> 46:51.378
And there was another one...

46:52.446 --> 46:55.115
at some other time.

46:56.917 --> 46:59.353
So that's--
that's two right there.

46:59.386 --> 47:03.525

foundation of this very long

47:03.558 --> 47:05.292

love women.

of a woman aunt.

47:19.139 --> 47:20.908
Some of my best friends
are Jewish.

47:22.910 --> 47:24.144
What I'm trying to say is...

47:25.179 --> 47:27.047
Get in the box, you Jezebel!

47:27.081 --> 47:28.115

in a box in ages.

47:32.453 --> 47:33.987

47:35.422 --> 47:36.957

Um, before I get in the box,

47:57.277 --> 47:58.513
could I just run
to the restroom

47:58.546 --> 48:00.280
and make sure
my hair is perfect?

the Real World was run by men.

58:36.083 --> 58:37.585
And then there was a minute

58:37.618 --> 58:40.187
where I thought
it was run by horses.

58:40.221 --> 58:43.224
But then I realized that horses
are just men extenders.

58:43.257 --> 58:45.760
-[Kens] Oh!
-[Pompadour Ken] Hmm?

58:45.793 --> 58:47.728
Oh. I had that treehouse.

58:47.762 --> 58:49.830
I saved up my allowance
to buy it.

58:49.864 --> 58:54.335
[Barbie] I've never seen
a car like that
before. What happened here?

58:54.368 --> 58:57.104
Everything,
basically everything exists

58:57.138 --> 58:59.974
to expand and elevate
the presence of men.

59:00.007 --> 59:01.909
-That's amazing.
-That's beautiful.

59:01.942 --> 59:03.210
-I know.
-[other Ken 1] Barbie's here.

59:03.244 --> 59:04.345
[other Ken 2] Uh-oh.

59:04.378 --> 59:07.615
-Ken?
-[laughs nervously]

59:07.648 --> 59:09.617
What have you done?

59:09.650 --> 59:12.153
What are you wearing?

59:12.186 --> 59:15.122
Don't question it.
Just roll with it, tiny baby.

59:15.156 --> 59:17.091
-[other Ken] Tiny baby.
-Don't call me baby.

59:17.124 --> 59:19.093
What about mini-baby?
Like this mini-fridge.

59:19.126 --> 59:20.027
[Kens laugh]

59:20.061 --> 59:21.829
No, Ken.

59:21.862 --> 59:25.132
This is my Dreamhouse.
It is my Dreamhouse! It's mine!

59:25.166 --> 59:27.201
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dreamhouse.

59:27.234 --> 59:32.873
This shall henceforth be known
as Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

59:32.907 --> 59:34.875
You don't have to say dojo
and house.

59:34.909 --> 59:36.243
And casa...

59:36.277 --> 59:38.279
But you do
because it feels good. Try it.

59:38.312 --> 59:40.681
-[both] Mojo Dojo Casa--
-No, girls. Don't say it.

59:40.714 --> 59:42.750
Mojo Dojo Casa House.

59:42.783 --> 59:44.652
[laughs]

59:44.685 --> 59:46.053
[Mattel CEO]
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

59:46.087 --> 59:49.056
Whoa, boss,
these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses

59:49.090 --> 59:51.292
are literally flying
off the shelves.

59:51.325 --> 59:55.663
The kids are clamoring
for them.
Ken is on T-shirts, mugs.

59:55.696 --> 59:57.798
-It's the number one tattoo.
-[Mattel CEO] Oh, no.

59:57.832 --> 01:00:00.768
Warner Bros. have started
auditions for the Ken movie,

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:04.705
which is already
a blockbuster hit. [laughs]

01:00:04.738 --> 01:00:06.373
It's happening. That thing
we could never imagine.

01:00:06.407 --> 01:00:07.975
If we don't get
my words lady...

01:00:08.008 --> 01:00:09.944
-Executive Assistant.
-My Executive Words Lady

01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:11.245
and someone
who's probably her daughter

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:12.780
back here and close the portal,

01:00:12.813 --> 01:00:14.215
our worlds could be altered
forever.

01:00:14.248 --> 01:00:16.117
Well, what does it matter
if it's Barbie or Ken?

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:17.418
The money is pouring in.

01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:19.820
Shame on you,
Executive Number Two.

01:00:19.854 --> 01:00:21.922
You think I spent
my entire life in boardrooms

01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:23.057
because of a bottom line?

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.658
No! I got into this business

01:00:24.692 --> 01:00:26.894
because of little girls
and their dreams.

01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:29.130
In the least creepy way
possible.

01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:32.133
Now, blade faster.
Time is running out.

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:34.802
Look, I'm just having
some brewski beers

01:00:34.835 --> 01:00:37.071
at my Mojo Dojo Casa House.

01:00:37.104 --> 01:00:38.772
-[all gasp]
-Ken!

01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:40.307
You can stay if you want,

01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:42.076
as my bride wife,

01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:44.778
or my long-term-low-
commitment-distance girlfriend.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:46.247
-What do you say?
-Ugh.

01:00:47.114 --> 01:00:48.349
Brewski beer me?

01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:51.218
I will not brewski beer you.

01:00:51.252 --> 01:00:53.854
Ha-ha-ha. That's fine.

01:00:53.888 --> 01:00:55.723
You know, now that
you Barbies aren't around
to run everything,

01:00:55.756 --> 01:00:57.158
we can do our hair
however we like.

01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:58.459
I have hats.

01:00:58.492 --> 01:01:01.929
Where are my hungry boys?
Who wants snacks?

01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:03.931
Barbie,
I am so happy to see you.

01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:05.132
Can you believe
what is happening?

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:06.834
I know. Isn't it great?

01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:09.303
Anyone need a brewski beer?

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:12.039
What are you doing?
You're a doctor.

01:01:12.072 --> 01:01:13.941
I like being
a helpful decoration.

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:16.844
And Allan likes to help me give
all the Kens foot massages.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:18.078
No, I don't, I don't like that.

01:01:18.112 --> 01:01:20.047
[both] We love it.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.315
-Ugh, so gross.
-I'm so blotto-faced
day-drunk right now.

01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:22.316
[laughs]

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:24.285
Ditto same-same that.

01:01:24.318 --> 01:01:25.886
[Brunette Barbie 2]
I like not having to make
any decisions.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.222
It's like a spa day
for my brain. Forever.

01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:30.090
What is wrong with them?

01:01:30.124 --> 01:01:31.458
We just explained to them
the immaculate,

01:01:31.492 --> 01:01:33.127
impeccable seamless
garment of logic

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.762
that is patriarchy,
and they crumbled.

01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:36.964
Oh, my God.
This is like in the 1500s

01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:38.799
with the indigenous people
and smallpox.

01:01:38.832 --> 01:01:40.234
They had no defenses
against it.

01:01:40.267 --> 01:01:43.437
Yeah. Buckle up, babe.
[chuckles]

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:46.907
Because Barbie Land
is now Ken Land.

01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:49.410
And it's gonna be just like
Century City in Los Angeles,

01:01:49.443 --> 01:01:52.813
because they had it all
figured out in Century City.

01:01:52.846 --> 01:01:55.149
The minute you get
out of your car, you're like,

01:01:55.182 --> 01:01:57.851
"I can't believe
how great this place is!"

01:01:57.885 --> 01:02:00.254
No, no, no. They don't have it
figured out in Century City

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:02.356
because we failed them.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:04.758
[loudly] No! You failed me!

01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:06.227
[sighs]

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.095
-[melancholy music playing]
-[breath trembles]

01:02:10.532 --> 01:02:13.100
Out there, I was somebody.

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:16.870
And when I walked
down the street...

01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:21.809
people respected me
just for who I am.

01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:28.782
[scoffs] One lady, she even
asked me for the time.

01:02:28.816 --> 01:02:29.551
No way!

01:02:29.584 --> 01:02:31.151
Way. [chuckles]

01:02:33.921 --> 01:02:35.356
And if it weren't
for these technicalities

01:02:35.389 --> 01:02:37.925
like MBAs, medical degrees,

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:42.997
and I don't know,
swim lessons, I could
have ruled that world.

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.498
But I don't need
any of those things here.

01:02:44.532 --> 01:02:45.833
[chuckles lightly]

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:49.103
[car bonnet squeaking]

01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:54.108
Here, I'm just a dude.
And you know what?

01:02:58.412 --> 01:02:59.446
That's enough.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.881
TV remote.

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:06.453
Which one is it?

01:03:06.487 --> 01:03:08.322
Oh, it's that one right there.

01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:10.391
[Reporter Barbie laughs]

01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:11.959

You can't do this.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:44.526
This is Barbie Land.

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:46.561
The Barbies worked hard
and they dreamed hard

01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:49.463
to make it
everything that it is. You--

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:52.933
You can't just
undo it in a day.

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:55.169
Literally and figuratively,
watch me.

01:03:56.236 --> 01:04:00.407
Now, if you'll excuse me...

this is my Mojo Dojo

Barbie's Mojo Dojo
Casa House.

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:10.184

It is not fun, is it?

It's boys' night!

[Ken] ...and your Ice Capades

-[gasps]
-These are archival.

Honey.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:33.300
Why did you wish me
to your messed-up world

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:37.371
using your complicated
human thoughts and feelings?

01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:40.441
-What?
-Barbie Land
was perfect before.

01:05:41.543 --> 01:05:44.311
I was perfect before.

01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:48.015
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't trying to do anything.

01:05:48.048 --> 01:05:49.216
-[objects clattering]
-Don't apologize.

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.553
Don't blame my mom.

01:05:51.586 --> 01:05:53.353
[Sasha's mom] Aw, Sasha,
that's sweet.

01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:56.423
Maybe you wished us.
Maybe it's your fault, Barbie.

01:05:56.457 --> 01:05:57.692
[Barbie] No,
I didn't wish anything.

01:05:57.725 --> 01:06:01.061
I've never wanted
anything to change.

01:06:01.094 --> 01:06:06.300
Oh, honey, that's life.
It's all change.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:08.636
That's...

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:10.370
That's terrifying.

[somber music playing]

01:06:14.676 --> 01:06:15.610
I don't want that.

01:06:15.643 --> 01:06:17.110
[music swelling]

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:19.714
Not my life. No, thank you.

01:06:19.747 --> 01:06:23.183
Just, no, I don't want this.

01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:26.721
[sighs]

01:06:29.624 --> 01:06:32.226
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait and hope

01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:35.062
that one of the more
leadership-oriented Barbies

01:06:35.095 --> 01:06:37.064
just snaps out of it

01:06:37.097 --> 01:06:39.066
and does something
about this whole mess.

01:06:39.099 --> 01:06:41.603
I really understand
this feeling.

01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:44.706
It's basically, like, being
a human person all the time--

01:06:44.739 --> 01:06:47.040
Please just leave me here.
Just leave me.

01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:50.812
Go back to your messed-up world
and just leave me to mine.

01:06:50.845 --> 01:06:53.213
-So, you're just gonna give up?
-[Barbie] Yes.

01:06:53.247 --> 01:06:54.782
[body squeaking]

01:06:58.085 --> 01:06:59.486
Okay.

01:06:59.521 --> 01:07:01.154
[Sasha] You know,
I almost feel bad for you,

01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:03.625
but you are exactly
what I thought you were.

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:05.793
Um...

01:07:06.828 --> 01:07:08.796
Let's go, honey. Let's just...

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.230
Okay, how do we--
how do you expect--

01:07:10.264 --> 01:07:11.633

you're accused of complaining.

01:14:49.657 --> 01:14:52.093
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

01:14:52.126 --> 01:14:53.594
that you tempt them too much

01:14:53.627 --> 01:14:55.129
or that you threaten
other women

01:14:55.162 --> 01:14:56.897
because you're supposed to be
a part of the sisterhood

01:14:56.931 --> 01:14:58.699
but always stand out.

01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:01.235
And always be grateful.

01:15:01.268 --> 01:15:03.137
But never forget
that the system is rigged,

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.772
so find a way
to acknowledge that

01:15:04.805 --> 01:15:06.841
but also always be grateful.

01:15:06.874 --> 01:15:08.843
You have to never get old,

01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:11.779
never be rude,
never show off,

01:15:11.812 --> 01:15:14.015
never be selfish,
never fall down,

01:15:14.048 --> 01:15:16.017
never fail, never show fear,

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:17.918
never get out of line.

01:15:17.952 --> 01:15:20.621
It's too hard,
it's too contradictory,

01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:23.657
and nobody gives you a medal
or says thank you.

01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:25.092
And it turns out, in fact,

01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:26.293
that not only
are you doing everything wrong

01:15:26.327 --> 01:15:28.896
but also
everything is your fault.

01:15:30.998 --> 01:15:31.932
[sighs]

01:15:33.968 --> 01:15:37.638
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:41.575
and every single other woman

01:15:41.609 --> 01:15:45.913
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us.

01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:51.152
And if all of that

01:15:52.153 --> 01:15:54.955
is also true for a doll

01:15:56.223 --> 01:16:00.227
just representing a woman...

01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:05.332
then I don't even know.

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:12.606
Wait.

01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:16.143
I did write a book.

01:16:16.177 --> 01:16:18.245
It's like I've been in a dream,

01:16:18.279 --> 01:16:21.282
where I was somehow
really invested

01:16:21.315 --> 01:16:24.118
in the Zack Snyder cut
of <i>Justice League.</i>

01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:28.923
But what you said
broke me out of it.

01:16:29.857 --> 01:16:30.791
Really?

01:16:30.825 --> 01:16:31.926
Yeah.

01:16:31.959 --> 01:16:33.894
You're back. She's back.

01:16:33.928 --> 01:16:36.163
By giving voice
to the cognitive
dissonance required

01:16:36.197 --> 01:16:37.865
to be a woman
under the patriarchy,

01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:39.967
-you robbed it of its power.
-Yes.

01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:42.970
Wow, I just said all of that.

01:16:43.003 --> 01:16:45.639
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

01:16:45.673 --> 01:16:48.909
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:50.978
We have to stop the Kens.

01:16:51.011 --> 01:16:53.247
And you need to say
all of those things
to the other Barbies.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.748
-That's the key.
-Got it.

01:16:54.782 --> 01:16:56.016
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:57.685
away from their Kens?

01:16:57.718 --> 01:16:59.120
We have experience
with a world like this one.

01:16:59.153 --> 01:17:00.721
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

01:17:00.754 --> 01:17:02.756
What do you think?

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:03.757
[whirring]

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:07.128
-Wow.
-[Weird Barbie] Thanks.
I built it.

01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:08.362
Okay, here's the deal.

01:17:08.395 --> 01:17:10.064
It's not just about
how they see us,

01:17:10.097 --> 01:17:11.866
it's about
how they see themselves.

01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:14.835
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

01:17:14.869 --> 01:17:17.805
First we have to get
the Barbies
away from their Kens.

01:17:17.838 --> 01:17:21.041
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

01:17:21.075 --> 01:17:22.309
-That should be you.
-Cool.

01:17:24.044 --> 01:17:25.746
[rousing pop music playing]

[Sasha] <i>Distract them</i>

01:17:31.952 --> 01:17:34.188

01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:36.790
[Sasha's mom] <i>You have</i>

01:17:36.824 --> 01:17:38.726

The influence that Porsche 356

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.402
has had on the motoring world
as a whole,

01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:49.803
it can't be overstated.

01:17:49.837 --> 01:17:52.039
Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

01:17:52.072 --> 01:17:54.308
I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:56.210
Honey, you can only use
the Select tool

01:17:56.243 --> 01:17:57.811
if the layer is highlighted.

01:17:57.845 --> 01:17:58.879
Let me show you.

01:17:58.913 --> 01:18:00.281
My tiny head is just swimming

01:18:00.314 --> 01:18:02.249
with technical jargon

01:18:02.283 --> 01:18:05.085
-Oh! Hi.
-...and magnetic lassos
and bit maps.

01:18:05.119 --> 01:18:07.254
Do you think that you and your
strong arms can explain...

01:18:07.288 --> 01:18:09.323
-Oh! What's happening?
-[Barbie] Allan, go around!

01:18:09.356 --> 01:18:10.291
[President Barbie] Ahh!

01:18:11.759 --> 01:18:13.127
-Oh, but what about Ken?
-No, no, no!

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.930
-No, but I love him!
-[Barbie] Come on, Allan!

01:18:15.963 --> 01:18:18.332
[President Barbie] Hey!
What's gonna happen to Ken?

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:19.867
[Sasha's mom] Just listen.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.202
You have to be their mommies

01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:22.903
but not remind them
of their mommy.

01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:25.039
Any power you have
must be masked under a giggle.

01:18:25.072 --> 01:18:26.073
[ding]

01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:28.809

One minute I was president,

01:18:30.311 --> 01:18:33.147
and the next I was cutting
a Ken steak for him.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.216
Welcome back, Madam President.

01:18:35.249 --> 01:18:38.786
Then we'll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies
to our cause.

[Barbie] <i>They can be</i>

01:18:48.262 --> 01:18:49.463
<i>The Godfather.</i>

01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:51.165
I've never seen it.

01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:53.000
Oh, my God.
You've never seen
<i>The Godfather?</i>

01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:55.202
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:56.870
and a triumph for Robert Evans

01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:58.372
and the architecture
of the '70s studio system.

01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.840
[President Barbie] Can you
start the movie over

01:18:59.873 --> 01:19:01.242
and just talk
through the whole thing?

01:19:01.275 --> 01:19:03.143
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

01:19:03.177 --> 01:19:04.845
without damaging their egos.

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:06.247
Because if you say yes to them,
you're a tramp,

I just have all my money
in a savings account.

01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:19.193
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

01:19:19.226 --> 01:19:20.427
corporate bonds, CDs.

01:19:20.461 --> 01:19:22.263
No one has CDs anymore.

01:19:22.296 --> 01:19:25.065
Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute
when you're confused.

01:19:25.099 --> 01:19:26.900
But no, not music.

until every single Barbie

to take back Barbie Land.

-Yes!

to turn the Kens
against each other.

01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.507
Now that they think
they have power over you,

01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:41.909
you make them question whether
they have enough power

01:20:41.942 --> 01:20:43.310
over each other.

01:20:43.344 --> 01:20:45.547

like me anymore?

-He likes you.
-He was really upset.

01:20:55.422 --> 01:20:57.291
Because he likes you.

01:20:57.324 --> 01:20:59.059
And because he knows deep down

01:20:59.093 --> 01:21:01.195
that you don't like him
the same way.

01:21:01.228 --> 01:21:02.996
It still doesn't mean
I want to hurt him.

-Land of the--
-Land of the free and the men.

are just better at ruling

patriarchy and you know,
made a patriarchy.

-Who are we attacking, sir?
-No...

01:32:25.946 --> 01:32:27.548
[Ken chuckles nervously]

01:32:28.082 --> 01:32:29.116
No...

01:32:31.118 --> 01:32:32.720
[cries dramatically]

01:32:32.753 --> 01:32:34.588
Don't look at me!

01:32:35.356 --> 01:32:37.191
[whispering] Is he crying?

01:32:37.224 --> 01:32:38.959
Just give us a minute.

01:32:38.993 --> 01:32:40.928
[Ken sobbing in distance]

01:32:40.961 --> 01:32:42.196
[breath shudders]

01:32:44.165 --> 01:32:45.900
-Ken.
-[continues sobbing]

01:32:48.335 --> 01:32:49.737
Are you okay?

01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:51.272
Yeah. Totally.

01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:53.107
[Barbie] It's okay
if you're crying.

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.643
You know, I cried too.
It's actually kind of amazing.

01:32:55.676 --> 01:32:58.045
[Ken] I'm a liberated man.
I know crying is not weak.

01:32:58.079 --> 01:33:00.181
-[Barbie] Okay.
-[crying softly]

01:33:01.715 --> 01:33:02.750
You wanna sit up for a minute?

01:33:03.751 --> 01:33:04.885
[grunts]

01:33:05.986 --> 01:33:07.054
[sighs]

01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:10.157
This, uh...

01:33:10.191 --> 01:33:12.026
It was hard running stuff.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.096
I didn't love it. [cries]

01:33:15.930 --> 01:33:17.264
I get it.

01:33:20.401 --> 01:33:21.869
[exhales]

01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.904
And those mini-fridges
are so small.

01:33:23.938 --> 01:33:25.873
-[Barbie] Mm-hmm.
-You could only fit
a six pack in them.

01:33:25.906 --> 01:33:29.176
[crying] And the freezers
are basically useless.

01:33:31.045 --> 01:33:32.780
To be honest, when I found out

01:33:32.813 --> 01:33:34.248
that patriarchy wasn't
about horses,

01:33:34.281 --> 01:33:35.916
I lost interest anyway.

01:33:37.084 --> 01:33:38.319
That's okay.

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.754
[sniffles]

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:46.193
I always thought this
would be our house. [chuckles]

01:33:49.063 --> 01:33:50.197
Oh.

01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:52.900
[Ken sobs loudly]

01:33:52.933 --> 01:33:56.737
-Ken.
-[sobbing and muttering]

01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:59.273
-I think I owe you an apology.
-Huh?

01:33:59.306 --> 01:34:01.275
I'm really sorry
I took you for granted.

01:34:01.308 --> 01:34:03.811
Oh.

01:34:03.844 --> 01:34:06.147
Not every night
had to be girls' night.

01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:11.752
[sighs] Thank you
for saying that.

01:34:11.785 --> 01:34:14.054
[sniffles] Thank you.

01:34:16.023 --> 01:34:19.460
Oh. I didn't mean
to suggest, uh...

01:34:19.493 --> 01:34:22.062
I just don't know who I am
without you.

01:34:23.397 --> 01:34:25.032
You're Ken.

01:34:26.033 --> 01:34:29.103
But it's "Barbie and Ken."

01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:33.307
There is no just "Ken."

01:34:34.408 --> 01:34:36.343
That's why I was created.

01:34:36.377 --> 01:34:38.045
I only exist

01:34:39.914 --> 01:34:41.849
within the warmth of your gaze.

01:34:43.083 --> 01:34:45.386
Without it,

01:34:45.419 --> 01:34:49.223
I'm just another blond guy
who can't do flips.

01:34:53.761 --> 01:34:55.763
-[dramatic music plays]
-[grunts]

01:34:55.796 --> 01:34:56.964
[crowd gasps]

01:34:58.065 --> 01:34:59.400
[gasping]

01:34:59.433 --> 01:35:03.737
Maybe it's time
to discover who Ken is.

01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:06.073
-Okay. I think I get it now.
-Okay. [chuckles]

01:35:06.106 --> 01:35:09.476
No, no, no!
This isn't the answer.

01:35:09.511 --> 01:35:12.012
-[smacks]
-[crowd gasps]

01:35:12.046 --> 01:35:13.314
[Ken] I feel so stupid.

01:35:13.347 --> 01:35:14.882
-[Pompadour Ken] No.
-[Tall Ken] No.

01:35:14.915 --> 01:35:17.251
-[crying] I look so stupid.
-[Barbies] Yeah.

01:35:17.284 --> 01:35:19.820
I look so stupid!

01:35:19.853 --> 01:35:23.090
-No! [crying]
-So cool. You look so cool.

01:35:23.123 --> 01:35:25.492
Okay. Ken,
you have to figure out

01:35:25.527 --> 01:35:27.328
who you are without me.

01:35:28.195 --> 01:35:30.097
[sighs] Why?

01:35:30.130 --> 01:35:31.966
You're not your girlfriend.

01:35:31.999 --> 01:35:34.868
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:36.837
-Beach?
-[Barbie] Nope.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:38.872
You're not even beach.

01:35:38.906 --> 01:35:42.977
Maybe all the things
that you thought made you you

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:46.981
aren't... really you.

01:35:51.819 --> 01:35:54.154
Maybe it's Barbie and...

01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:57.891
it's Ken.

01:36:01.095 --> 01:36:04.198
Ken is...

01:36:06.033 --> 01:36:06.934
me?

01:36:06.967 --> 01:36:08.135
Yes.

01:36:08.168 --> 01:36:10.971
Ken is me!

01:36:12.206 --> 01:36:13.941
And I'm Barbie.

01:36:13.974 --> 01:36:16.410
[soft uplifting music playing]

01:36:16.443 --> 01:36:17.911
Ken...

01:36:19.514 --> 01:36:20.515
is me!

01:36:20.548 --> 01:36:21.815
Ken is me!

01:36:21.849 --> 01:36:23.183
-Ken is me!
-Ken is me!

01:36:23.217 --> 01:36:24.451
[Ken laughs]

01:36:24.485 --> 01:36:25.520
I don't even care
about being Ken anymore.

01:36:25.553 --> 01:36:26.854
I just miss my friend Barbie!

01:36:26.887 --> 01:36:28.422
-That's cool!
-Barbie!

01:36:28.455 --> 01:36:30.157
-[gasps]
-I'm right here.

01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:31.191
Ken!

01:36:32.192 --> 01:36:33.093
[ding]

01:36:34.061 --> 01:36:35.496
[dramatic musical sting]

01:36:35.530 --> 01:36:38.165
I want you to have it.

01:36:38.198 --> 01:36:40.301
Aw. That's nice.

01:36:40.334 --> 01:36:42.537
[sentimental music playing]

01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:50.512
We were only fighting
because we didn't know
who we were.

01:36:52.946 --> 01:36:57.484
Ken is me!

01:37:01.088 --> 01:37:02.557
[laughing]

01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:06.126
[Mattel CEO laughing]

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.895
Ken is right.

01:37:07.928 --> 01:37:10.397
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:12.299
-You know?
-That's my boss.

01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:14.536
It's... [screams] Oh.

01:37:14.569 --> 01:37:16.538
Midge, gosh.

01:37:16.571 --> 01:37:18.339
I thought we discontinued her.

01:37:18.372 --> 01:37:20.441
[panting]

01:37:20.474 --> 01:37:23.143
Look,
do you know how many times

01:37:23.177 --> 01:37:26.480
I've wanted to stand up
in a board meeting
and just say,

01:37:26.514 --> 01:37:28.550
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:30.284
-Really?
-Let's have a company retreat

01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:32.052
-and just tickle each other.
-[executives laughing]

01:37:32.086 --> 01:37:34.188
-Someone get me.
Someone get me.
-[all laughing]

01:37:35.657 --> 01:37:37.525
-I love being tickled.
-[Kens laugh]

01:37:37.559 --> 01:37:40.595
No, no, no. Don't hug me.
Don't hug me.

01:37:41.261 --> 01:37:42.329
[sighs]

01:37:43.397 --> 01:37:45.432
But thanks to the Barbies,

01:37:45.466 --> 01:37:48.969
I, too, can now relieve
myself of this heavy
existential burden

01:37:49.002 --> 01:37:53.006
while holding on to
the very real title of CEO.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.510
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

01:37:55.543 --> 01:37:57.277
to exactly the way it was.

01:37:57.311 --> 01:38:00.981
-Mister Mattel, I just--
-Please. Call me Mother.

01:38:01.014 --> 01:38:02.349
No, thank you.

01:38:02.383 --> 01:38:04.151
I don't think
that things should go back

01:38:04.184 --> 01:38:05.653
to the way that they were.

01:38:05.687 --> 01:38:09.256
No Barbie or Ken should be
living in the shadows.

01:38:09.289 --> 01:38:10.592
Or Allan.

01:38:11.559 --> 01:38:12.960
-Hey.
-Me?

01:38:12.993 --> 01:38:14.662
-Yeah.
-Oh. Hello.

01:38:14.696 --> 01:38:16.096
I just want to say,

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:17.398
I'm sorry
we called you Weird Barbie

01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:19.066
behind your back
and also to your face.

01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:21.335
That's okay. I'm owning it.

01:38:21.368 --> 01:38:23.237
Would you like a job
in my cabinet?

01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:25.339
May I please have sanitation?

01:38:26.407 --> 01:38:28.008
It's yours.

01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:29.577
-Yeah, thank you.
-[President Barbie] All right.

01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:31.311
-Madam President.
-Oh.

01:38:31.345 --> 01:38:34.281
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

01:38:34.314 --> 01:38:38.385
Oh, I can't do that.
But maybe a lower circuit
court judgeship.

01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:40.354
We accept.
As long as we can wear robes.

01:38:40.387 --> 01:38:42.590
[narrator] <i>Well, the Kens</i>
<i>have to start somewhere.</i>

01:38:42.624 --> 01:38:44.559
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>the Kens will have</i>

01:38:44.592 --> 01:38:47.060
<i>as much power and influence</i>

01:38:47.094 --> 01:38:49.997
<i>as women have</i>
<i>in the Real World.</i>

01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:51.165
No, I don't want to.

01:38:51.198 --> 01:38:52.466
-Just go!
-I can't.

01:38:52.499 --> 01:38:55.469
-Grow up and go.
-I have an idea.

01:38:55.503 --> 01:38:57.271
Tell me your secret dream,
child.

01:38:57.304 --> 01:39:00.608
Okay,
what about Ordinary Barbie?

01:39:00.642 --> 01:39:03.645
She's not extraordinary.
She's not president
of anything,

01:39:03.678 --> 01:39:05.045
or maybe she is.

01:39:05.078 --> 01:39:07.014
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

01:39:07.047 --> 01:39:10.317
Because it's okay
to just want to be a mom,

01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:12.620
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

01:39:12.654 --> 01:39:14.421
Or not a mom
who's also not president.

01:39:14.455 --> 01:39:16.558
She just has a flattering top,

01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:18.091
and she wants
to get through the day

01:39:18.125 --> 01:39:20.662
feeling kinda good
about herself.

01:39:23.063 --> 01:39:25.299
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:25.332 --> 01:39:26.701
Yeah,
that's going to make money.

01:39:26.734 --> 01:39:30.437
Oh. Ordinary Barbie.
I love it. Fantastic.

01:39:30.471 --> 01:39:31.606
Okay, great.

01:39:31.639 --> 01:39:33.207
-Great.
-Cool.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.441
-Yes.
-We good?

01:39:34.475 --> 01:39:35.643
I think we're good, right?

01:39:35.677 --> 01:39:37.579
All right, let's begin the work

01:39:37.612 --> 01:39:40.447
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

01:39:40.481 --> 01:39:42.483
Hey, what about Barbie?

01:39:42.517 --> 01:39:43.718
What do you mean?

01:39:43.751 --> 01:39:45.319
[crowd] Yeah,
what about Barbie?

01:39:45.352 --> 01:39:49.423
What's her ending?
What does she get?

01:39:49.456 --> 01:39:52.259
Well, that's easy.
She's in love with Ken.

01:39:52.292 --> 01:39:54.729
-[crowd] Aw.
-That is not her ending.

01:39:54.762 --> 01:39:57.030
[groans in frustration]

01:39:57.064 --> 01:39:59.099
-I'm not in love with Ken.
-[crowd] Oh.

01:39:59.132 --> 01:40:00.167
What do you want?

01:40:02.169 --> 01:40:03.538
I don't know. I'm...

01:40:05.673 --> 01:40:08.442
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore.

01:40:13.347 --> 01:40:15.215
I don't think I have an ending.

01:40:15.249 --> 01:40:17.284
[Ruth] That was
always the point.

01:40:17.317 --> 01:40:20.487
I created you
so you wouldn't have an ending.

01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:23.323
It's you.

01:40:25.693 --> 01:40:27.529
You're Ruth from Mattel.

01:40:27.562 --> 01:40:30.330
Baby, I am Mattel.

01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:33.300
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie.

01:40:33.333 --> 01:40:34.569
So, you're...

01:40:34.602 --> 01:40:37.639
Ruth Handler.
Inventor of Barbie.

01:40:37.672 --> 01:40:38.806
-[crowd gasps]
-What?

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.374
That's so cool.

01:40:40.407 --> 01:40:42.577
Her ghost keeps an office
on the 17th floor.

01:40:42.610 --> 01:40:43.578
-[Ruth] What?
-What?

01:40:43.611 --> 01:40:45.379
[Ruth] You guys,

01:40:45.412 --> 01:40:48.282
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

01:40:48.315 --> 01:40:50.450
[laughing]
I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

01:40:50.484 --> 01:40:52.152
with a double mastectomy...

01:40:52.185 --> 01:40:54.321
...and tax evasion issues.
[laughing]

01:40:54.354 --> 01:40:56.791
Nobody looks like Barbie,

01:40:56.824 --> 01:41:00.360
except, of course, Barbie.
Take a bow, honey.

01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:05.198
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore.

01:41:09.303 --> 01:41:11.138
