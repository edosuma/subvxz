WEBVTT

00:02.833 --> 00:04.033
- HI, GRANDMA.

00:04.033 --> 00:05.367
LOOK AT THE EASTER EGG
I MADE.

00:05.367 --> 00:07.267
- OH, THAT'S LOVELY, DEAR.

00:07.267 --> 00:08.800
- HEY, MA,
YOU WANT TO SEE AN EGG,

00:08.800 --> 00:10.700
LOOK AT THAT.

00:10.700 --> 00:11.967
- THAT'S LOVELY, TOO.

00:11.967 --> 00:15.733
YOU BOTH DO BEAUTIFUL WORK.

00:15.733 --> 00:17.133
AND GUESS WHAT,

00:17.133 --> 00:18.333
I MADE AN EXTRA BATCH
OF BUTTER COOKIES

00:18.333 --> 00:19.433
FOR YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.533
- OH, GOOD, I LOVE THOSE.

00:21.533 --> 00:24.400
- OH, AND, DEBRA, I'VE RUN OUT
OF THINGS TO PUT THEM IN,

00:24.400 --> 00:26.133
SO I CAME TO GET
THE CANISTER.

00:26.133 --> 00:27.433
- WHAT CANISTER?

00:27.433 --> 00:28.800
- MY CANISTER
WITH THE BLUE HORSES

00:28.800 --> 00:30.067
AROUND THE EDGE.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.667
- OH, YEAH,
I BROUGHT THAT BACK.

00:31.667 --> 00:32.867
- REALLY?
- YEP.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.100
- GRANDMA, COME ON.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.333
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
MY EASTER SHOES.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.600
- OKAY, JUST A MINUTE,
SWEETHEART.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.733
WELL, I THINK
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED

00:38.733 --> 00:40.900
IF YOU RETURNED THAT CANISTER
BECAUSE IT'S MY MOTHER'S.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.700
AND THERE'S EVEN A SPECIAL SPACE
ON MY SHELF FOR IT,

00:44.700 --> 00:47.333
WHICH IS EMPTY NOW.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.833
- YEAH, WELL,
I REMEMBER RETURNING IT,

00:48.833 --> 00:50.200
BECAUSE I HEARD
ABOUT THAT SPACE

00:50.200 --> 00:53.067
ON YOUR SHELF
WHEN YOU BROUGHT IT OVER.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.500
- OH.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.067
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE A MINUTE NOW

00:56.067 --> 00:57.433
AND LOOK FOR IT?

00:57.433 --> 00:59.033
AND WHILE YOU DO,
I COULD CORRECT A FEW

00:59.033 --> 01:01.767
OF THESE POTATOES.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.500
- YOU KNOW, MARIE,
IF THE CANISTER WAS HERE,

01:03.500 --> 01:05.033
I'M SURE
YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED IT

01:05.033 --> 01:08.367
DURING ONE OF
YOUR DAILY INSPECTIONS.

01:08.367 --> 01:10.533
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
UNTIL YOU FIND IT,

01:10.533 --> 01:12.633
AT LEAST IT'S WITH
PEOPLE I LOVE.

01:12.633 --> 01:16.967
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
LET ME SEE THOSE SHOES.

01:16.967 --> 01:18.500
- SERIOUSLY, DEB,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.400
FORGET YOU KNOW
ME AND ALLY.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.533
WHICH ONE'S BETTER?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.200
- MA?
WHERE'S MA?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.300
- WHY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:30.300 --> 01:36.000
- DAD GOT INTO THE HAM.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.100
- DID YOU LEAVE IT
ON THE COUNTER?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.300
HE JUMPS UP THERE.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.233
- WHAT DID HE DO?

01:41.233 --> 01:42.933
- HE'S LOPPING OFF
SLICES OF IT

01:42.933 --> 01:46.033
AND PUTTING IT
INTO THE TOASTER.

01:46.033 --> 01:49.767
LIKE PORK POP-TARTS.
- [groans]

01:49.767 --> 01:51.100
EVERY YEAR.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.167
LAST YEAR, I CAUGHT HIM
IN THE CAR WITH IT.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.067
OKAY, IF YOU FIND
THE CANISTER, DEAR,

01:56.067 --> 01:57.367
GIVE ME A RING.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.267
- MARIE, I TOLD YOU.
I DON'T HAVE IT.

02:00.267 --> 02:03.167
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
MAYBE WHEN YOU STRAIGHTEN UP.

02:03.167 --> 02:07.000
- PLEASE--
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.700
IT'S NOT HERE.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.400
- YOU SEEM UPSET.
ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME, DEBRA?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
- WELL, YES,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.500
I AM UPSET, MARIE.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.133
BECAUSE WHAT I SAY
AND WHAT I DO

02:19.133 --> 02:21.167
SEEMS TO MEAN
VERY LITTLE TO YOU.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.733
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

02:22.733 --> 02:24.067
- WELL, YOU'VE ASKED ME
FOR THE CANISTER.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.467
I TELL YOU
I DON'T HAVE IT,

02:25.467 --> 02:26.967
BUT THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.233
- WELL, I DON'T HAVE IT.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.467
- OH, AND THERE'S
NO POSSIBILITY

02:29.467 --> 02:32.700
THAT YOU COULD HAVE
MISPLACED IT?

02:32.700 --> 02:35.067
- NO.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.833
- SO I'M A THIEF, THEN,
AND A LIAR.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.200
I'M A LIAR AND A THIEF.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.000
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A LIAR AND A THIEF?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.133
[egg cracks]
- OH!

02:58.133 --> 02:59.700
- YOU KNOW, IT JUST--

02:59.700 --> 03:02.900
IT JUST HURTS
MY FEELINGS, MARIE.

03:02.900 --> 03:05.433
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU,
I BROUGHT THAT CANISTER BACK.

03:05.433 --> 03:06.733
AND IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME,

03:06.733 --> 03:10.767
THEN THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.033
- OH, WAIT.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.900
NO, HONEY,
HONEY, WAIT.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.500
WAIT.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.233
I DON'T WANT THIS.

03:23.233 --> 03:26.367
I MEAN, A HOLIDAY
IS A TIME FOR FAMILY.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.033
I LOVE THAT CANISTER,

03:28.033 --> 03:31.067
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT YOU FEELING LIKE THIS.

03:31.067 --> 03:34.800
I WANT US TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL EASTER.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.867
OKAY?

03:36.867 --> 03:40.500
OH, I'M SORRY, DEBRA.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.367
- THANK YOU, MARIE.

03:48.367 --> 03:53.167
- WELL, I SHOULD GO.
THERE'S A PIG EATING MY HAM.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.367
- WOW.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.767
THE MARIE BARONE APOLOGY.

04:06.767 --> 04:11.933
UNTIL TODAY,
I HAD ONLY HEARD ABOUT IT.

04:11.933 --> 04:15.033
- AND TO YOU.
OH.

04:15.033 --> 04:19.733
THERE'S YOUR EASTER MIRACLE.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.567
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
NO, I GIVE HER A LOT OF CREDIT.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.167
BECAUSE THAT WAS HARD
FOR HER TO DO,

04:24.167 --> 04:26.200
BUT SHE DID IT,
AND SHE MEANT IT.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.133
HUH.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

04:28.133 --> 04:31.500
YEAH, I THINK I FINALLY
GOT THROUGH TO HER.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.300
I MEAN, NOW SHE SEES
SHE'S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.500
- IS THIS WHAT GRANDMA
WAS LOOKING FOR?

04:36.500 --> 04:39.300
- [shrieks]

04:45.100 --> 04:48.733
- OH, MY GOD.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.600
- ALLY,
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

04:57.600 --> 04:59.267
- YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

04:59.267 --> 05:02.633
- OH, MY GOD.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.600
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.500
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.767
I DIDN'T GIVE THIS TO YOU.
WHEN DID I GIVE THIS TO YOU?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.267
- I ASKED IF I COULD KEEP
MY CRAYONS IN HERE,

05:10.267 --> 05:11.933
AND YOU SAID YES.

05:11.933 --> 05:15.067
- OH, MY GOD!

05:22.800 --> 05:25.400
- I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.033
- UH, HONEY,
I'LL TAKE THAT.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.600
THANKS
FOR BRINGING THIS BACK.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.467
GREAT JOB.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.567
- YEAH,
THAT WAS SO GREAT.

05:31.567 --> 05:32.767
HEY, LOOK,

05:32.767 --> 05:34.333
HERE'S THE CHOCOLATE EGGS
FOR TOMORROW.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.067
YOU GO AND EAT
AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.433
- THANKS!

05:40.033 --> 05:41.567
- I COULD HAVE SWORN

05:41.567 --> 05:43.133
I GAVE THAT
BACK TO YOUR MOTHER.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.567
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:45.567 --> 05:48.433
WELL, HERE'S WHAT PROBABLY
HAPPENED, IS THAT,

05:48.433 --> 05:49.600
YOU KNOW, I'M DOING
A MILLION THINGS,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.167
AND THE KIDS
ARE ALWAYS AT YOU

05:51.167 --> 05:52.567
AND THEY'RE ASKING YOU
FOR STUFF,

05:52.567 --> 05:53.900
AND, YOU KNOW, ALLY
PROBABLY CAME UP TO ME

05:53.900 --> 05:55.300
AND ASKED ME FOR SOMETHING,

05:55.300 --> 05:56.967
AND I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR,
YOU KNOW?

05:56.967 --> 05:58.367
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T HEAR
THE WORD "GUN" OR "KNIFE,"

05:58.367 --> 06:00.800
I JUST SAID YEAH, SO...

06:00.800 --> 06:03.433
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT--THAT--
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.033
I'M POSITIVE,
BECAUSE, UH, YOU KNOW,

06:05.033 --> 06:06.600
I'M DOING, LIKE,
A MILLION THINGS,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.633
AND, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING HERE MYSELF,

06:08.633 --> 06:11.167
AND IF YOU WOULD PITCH IN
A LITTLE BIT MORE, RAY!

06:11.167 --> 06:13.133
- OH, NO, NO!

06:13.133 --> 06:16.033
NO, NO.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.267
THIS IS WHAT
DROWNING PEOPLE DO.

06:17.267 --> 06:20.633
THEY PULL YOU RIGHT DOWN
WITH THEM.

06:20.633 --> 06:24.400
- WELL, I'M SCREWED,
ALL RIGHT?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.100
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY BAD?

06:26.100 --> 06:27.700
SHE APOLOGIZED TO YOU

06:27.700 --> 06:30.067
EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW
SHE WAS RIGHT.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.367
- OH, SHUT UP!

06:32.367 --> 06:34.600
WHY DO YOU COME OVER HERE,
TO STATE THE OBVIOUS?

06:34.600 --> 06:39.633
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.033
- I MUST SAY, DEBRA,

06:41.033 --> 06:43.600
THIS IS NOT
YOUR MOST ATTRACTIVE SIDE.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.167
- WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO?

06:45.167 --> 06:46.600
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT
TO RETURN IT NOW.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.633
- ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

06:48.633 --> 06:50.367
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE WILL PUT ME THROUGH

06:50.367 --> 06:51.900
IF I HAVE TO BRING THIS THING
BACK OVER TO HER?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.100
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.733
- LOOK, THERE'S A WAY
TO FIX THIS.

06:55.733 --> 06:59.300
YOU JUST RETURN THIS TO HER
WITH YOUR HEART IN IT.

07:06.167 --> 07:08.633
- OKAY.
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.667
I GOT AN APOLOGY, OKAY?

07:11.667 --> 07:13.333
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.800
SHE APOLOGIZED TO ME.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.933
OKAY, THE WHOLE BALANCE
OF POWER SHIFTED.

07:19.933 --> 07:23.267
- IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
15 SECONDS.

07:23.267 --> 07:24.867
- YOU KNOW WHAT, WE GOT TO
GET RID OF THIS THING.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.867
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

07:26.867 --> 07:28.733
THIS WAS MY GRANDMA'S.

07:28.733 --> 07:30.833
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY COOKIES
I'VE HAD FROM THIS THING?

07:30.833 --> 07:32.533
- MMM, AND LEMON SQUARES.

07:32.533 --> 07:33.767
- BROWNIES.

07:33.767 --> 07:34.867
- BLONDIES.

07:34.867 --> 07:36.133
- FUDGE.

07:36.133 --> 07:39.167
- CHOCOLATE BISCOTTI.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.233
- MACAROONS.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.400
- OH, THE MACAROONS.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.033
- HOW ABOUT THE GINGERSNAPS?

07:43.033 --> 07:46.133
- HEY, FAT PEOPLE,
WHO CARES?

07:51.067 --> 07:52.800
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST A CANISTER.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.267
IT'S A CAN.

07:54.267 --> 07:55.700
EVERYBODY WILL GET OVER IT.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.367
I'M THROWING IT OUT.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.367
- EXCUSE ME, DEB,
NOT TO GET TECHNICAL,

07:59.367 --> 08:00.600
BUT WHAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING

08:00.600 --> 08:03.133
IS THEFT AND DESTRUCTION
OF PROPERTY.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.400
AND I CAN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN TO SOMETHING

08:04.400 --> 08:09.133
THAT ONCE BELONGED
TO MY GAMMY.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.433
- YEAH, COME ON, DEBRA.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.933
I MEAN, MY MOTHER
LOVES THIS THING.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.367
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.433
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND YOU'RE RIGHT,

08:16.433 --> 08:18.167
AND YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT,
OKAY?

08:18.167 --> 08:21.167
EVERYBODY'S RIGHT
EXCEPT FOR ME.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.600
I JUST THOUGHT THAT,
YOU KNOW,

08:23.600 --> 08:28.800
FOR ONCE SHE RESPECTED ME
ENOUGH TO APOLOGIZE.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.833
[sighs]

08:29.833 --> 08:31.233
BUT I SCREWED UP,

08:31.233 --> 08:32.667
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GIVE ME THE THING,

08:32.667 --> 08:34.467
AND I WILL
TAKE IT BACK TO HER,

08:34.467 --> 08:37.767
AND I WILL LET HER SAY
WHATEVER SHE'S GOING TO SAY.

08:44.333 --> 08:48.367
NOBODY'S GOING TO STOP ME?

08:48.367 --> 08:51.000
NOBODY CARES
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.367
OR--OR NOT EVEN TO ME,

08:52.367 --> 08:53.767
BUT LET'S JUST SAY
I BRING THIS THING BACK

08:53.767 --> 08:56.433
AND THEN SHE THINKS
SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT

08:56.433 --> 08:58.133
AND SHE HAS MORE POWER
THAN EVER.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.600
LIKE WHEN YOU SAY,

08:59.600 --> 09:01.133
"MOM, I DON'T WANT
TO MARRY THAT GIRL," HUH?

09:01.133 --> 09:02.467
"I THINK YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT HER."

09:02.467 --> 09:03.500
"OH, REALLY?

09:03.500 --> 09:06.667
WAS I WRONG
ABOUT THE CANISTER?"

09:06.667 --> 09:08.100
OR YOU...

09:08.100 --> 09:10.600
WHEN YOU SAY,
"MOM, YOU KNOW,

09:10.600 --> 09:12.067
"I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD MOVE IN WITH US

09:12.067 --> 09:14.233
NOW THAT DAD HAS PASSED."

09:14.233 --> 09:20.067
"OH, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THE CANISTER?"

09:20.067 --> 09:22.333
BUT--BUT YOU GUYS DO
WHAT YOU WANT.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.533
- IT IS JUST A CANISTER.

09:30.233 --> 09:31.567
- I'M GOING
TO TURN MY BACK.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.600
YOU DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.433
- ALL RIGHT.

09:46.433 --> 09:49.900
I'M GOING TO THROW IT OUT,
OKAY?

09:49.900 --> 09:53.800
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.600
OH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT, RAYMOND?

09:55.600 --> 09:59.933
- WHY, YES, IT IS.
IT SURE IS, ROBERT.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.200
- OH, COME ON.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.867
NOBODY EVER EMPTIES
THE TRASH AROUND HERE.

10:03.867 --> 10:07.133
IF I DON'T DO IT,
IT DOESN'T GET DONE.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.000
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.733
[clanging]

10:38.767 --> 10:41.733
- IT'S DONE.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.833
THANK YOU.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.333
- I FEEL COLD.

10:52.133 --> 10:55.367
- SO YOU'RE WITH ME NOW,
RIGHT?

10:57.533 --> 11:02.600
- I GUESS SO.
- NO MATTER WHAT?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.100
- NO MATTER WHAT.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.167
- RAY?

11:16.800 --> 11:19.767
- DEVIL, THY NAME IS WOMAN.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.233
- OKAY, IT'S TIME
FOR EASTER DINNER.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.700
COME ON, KIDS.
WE'RE GOING TO GRANDMA'S.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.400
COME ON, RAY, LET'S GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.933
[video game laser blasts]

11:29.933 --> 11:32.333
AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY.
- YEAH, I'M READY NOW.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.833
- ALL RIGHT, TELL ME
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

11:33.833 --> 11:35.333
AND THEN WE'LL GO.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.833
- YEAH, I'M READY.

11:36.833 --> 11:41.667
- WHAT--
YOU GOING LIKE THAT?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.933
OH!

11:42.933 --> 11:44.467
- ALLY, COME ON.
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.

11:44.467 --> 11:47.733
- OH, SEE?
YOU WEREN'T READY.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.067
[metal clanging]

12:05.967 --> 12:07.133
WHAT THE HELL?

12:07.133 --> 12:08.400
- I GOT IT.
- IT'S MY TURN!

12:08.400 --> 12:10.300
- I GOT IT!
- MY TURN!

12:10.300 --> 12:12.733
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
GUYS, GUYS!

12:12.733 --> 12:14.567
HOLD IT, HOLD IT!

12:14.567 --> 12:16.067
I THOUGHT YOU GOT RID
OF THIS THING.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.867
- I DID.
I PUT IT IN THE GARBAGE.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.533
THE OUTSIDE GARBAGE.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.167
BOYS, WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS?

12:22.167 --> 12:24.167
- IN THE GARBAGE.

12:24.167 --> 12:27.700
- OH, YOU GOT
TO FEED THEM MORE!

12:27.700 --> 12:30.333
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE GARBAGE?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.100
- LOOKING FOR EASTER EGGS.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.400
- [sighs]

12:33.400 --> 12:37.267
YOU KNOW,
JUST WAIT A SECOND, KIDS.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.500
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.100
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THIS
BACK NOW, OKAY?

12:40.100 --> 12:41.800
IT'S COME BACK TWICE.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.600
IT'S--IT'S LIKE A SIGN.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.200
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU THINK
THE MOVIE'S OVER,

12:45.200 --> 12:48.567
THEN THE HAND COMES UP!

12:48.567 --> 12:51.100
ALL RIGHT, SO WE JUST BRING
THIS BACK, RIGHT?

12:51.100 --> 12:52.600
- OKAY.
- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.233
SO YOU'LL JUST SAY
THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE

12:54.233 --> 12:55.900
AND THAT IT WAS HERE
ALL ALONG, THAT'S ALL.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.500
- NO.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?
- NO.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.967
WE'LL, UH--
WE'LL SNEAK IT IN.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.467
WE'LL HIDE IT
IN HER HOUSE,

13:03.467 --> 13:04.900
AND THEN SHE'LL JUST
COME ACROSS IT SOMEDAY,

13:04.900 --> 13:06.500
AND THEN SHE'LL REALIZE
THAT SHE WAS THE ONE

13:06.500 --> 13:09.833
THAT WAS WRONG.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.633
- EXCEPT SHE WASN'T WRONG.

13:11.633 --> 13:15.200
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T LOVE ME?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.633
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, FINE,
SNEAK IT BACK IN.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.333
BUT WHEN YOU SAY,
"WE'LL SNEAK IT BACK IN,"

13:24.333 --> 13:26.133
YOU MEAN YOU AND ALLY
WILL SNEAK IT BACK IN,

13:26.133 --> 13:27.567
'CAUSE THAT'LL BE GREAT.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.800
THAT'LL BE LIKE
A "TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK"

13:29.800 --> 13:32.367
KIND OF THING.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.900
- YOU'LL DO WHAT I SAY.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.667
- YES, I WILL.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.500
- HI, GRANDMA!

13:38.500 --> 13:40.300
- HI, I THINK THE EASTER BUNNY
LEFT SOMETHING

13:40.300 --> 13:43.167
FOR YOU KIDS
IN THE KITCHEN.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.033
- HI, MARIE.
HAPPY EASTER.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.367
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR LETTING ME

13:46.367 --> 13:48.300
TAKE A CRACK
AT THESE MASHED POTATOES.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.767
SHOULD WE GO CHECK THEM?

13:49.767 --> 13:53.000
- NO, I'M SURE
THEY'RE FINE, DEAR.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.300
- HAPPY EASTER, RAYMOND.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.300
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO TAKE OFF YOUR COAT?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.033
IT LOOKS AWFULLY HOT.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.100
- NO, I'M A LITTLE CHILLY.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.333
- OOH, ARE YOU GETTING
SICK, HONEY?

14:17.333 --> 14:18.700
- NO, NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.633
- FRANK, TURN UP THE HEAT.
RAYMOND'S SICK.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.433
- NO, MOM, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT SICK.

14:22.433 --> 14:25.600
I JUST THINK THAT
THIS IS A BITCHIN' JACKET.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.700
- THAT'S NOT EASTER LANGUAGE.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.800
BUT IT IS STYLISH.
DID I GIVE THIS TO YOU?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.200
- YOU KNOW, PLEASE, MARIE,

14:40.200 --> 14:41.367
I WANT YOU TO CHECK
THESE POTATOES.

14:41.367 --> 14:42.833
I THINK I LEFT
SOME EYES IN IT.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.367
- OH, STOP WORRYING,
DARLING.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.767
THEY'LL BE DELICIOUS.

14:45.767 --> 14:46.900
IS THIS DOWN?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.600
- MARIE,
I AM A TERRIBLE COOK.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.333
I REALLY WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT THESE POTATOES.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.800
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.700
- WELL, OKAY,
LET'S GO IN THE KITCHEN

14:55.700 --> 14:57.033
AND TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.300
- OH, GOOD,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

14:58.300 --> 14:59.867
THESE POTATOES DESERVE
TO SHARE A TABLE

14:59.867 --> 15:03.100
WITH YOUR FABULOUS HAM.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.533
- HEY, RAY.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.767
AAH!

15:30.100 --> 15:31.167
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:31.167 --> 15:32.233
- NOTHING!

15:32.233 --> 15:33.567
- THEN--THEN WHY IS IT HERE?

15:33.567 --> 15:35.467
- LOOK, BECAUSE--
- WHY IS IT HERE, MAN?

15:35.467 --> 15:36.700
- WILL YOU SHUT UP, PLEASE?

15:36.700 --> 15:37.533
HELP ME HIDE IT!

15:37.533 --> 15:38.900
- NO, I'M NOT TOUCHING IT!

15:38.900 --> 15:40.500
- YOU SAID NO MATTER WHAT.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.167
- I DIDN'T KNOW I'D BE BATTLING
THE SUPERNATURAL.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.533
- HELLO, DEAR.
- NO, MARIE--

15:48.367 --> 15:50.533
- MOMMY.
HI, MOMMY.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.200
- I JUST CAME TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.167
OH, TEN MINUTES
TILL DINNER.

15:55.167 --> 15:58.267
- OH!
TEN MINUTES.

15:58.267 --> 16:02.200
THAT'S MY FAVORITE
AMOUNT OF TIME.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.567
- OH, RAYMOND--

16:03.567 --> 16:07.133
- RAYMOND, HAPPY EASTER,
MY BROTHER!

16:07.133 --> 16:08.600
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH!

16:08.600 --> 16:09.867
- THANK YOU, MAN.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.033
YEAH.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.633
HAPPY EASTER TO YOU,
YOU KNOW?

16:12.633 --> 16:14.700
HEY, IF I DON'T SEE YOU,
HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.067
- YEAH.

16:16.067 --> 16:19.567
- OH.
ISN'T THIS NICE?

16:19.567 --> 16:20.733
OH-HO-HO.

16:20.733 --> 16:21.800
[laughs]

16:21.800 --> 16:24.500
OH, THIS IS WHY
I LIKE HOLIDAYS.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.967
I'M SO HAPPY.
THIS IS BROTHERS.

16:27.967 --> 16:31.167
I'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.467
- YOU HAVE, MA.

16:32.467 --> 16:35.733
I LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY.
[kissing sounds]

16:39.800 --> 16:41.133
- SO ARE WE DONE NOW?

16:41.133 --> 16:42.933
- NO, JUST A LITTLE MORE.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.933
[laughs]

16:44.933 --> 16:48.467
OH...

16:51.867 --> 16:54.700
OH, FRANK,
COME TAKE A LOOK.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.600
- WHAT?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.233
- YOUR SONS ARE HUGGING.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.133
- WANT ME TO GET THE HOSE?

17:02.133 --> 17:05.000
- OH, NO.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.600
OH...

17:07.600 --> 17:10.633
YOU BOYS HAVE MADE
MY EASTER.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.867
- GET OFF ME.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.233
WHAT ARE YOU
KISSING ME FOR?

17:18.233 --> 17:21.300
- I WAS IN THE MOMENT.

17:23.067 --> 17:25.367
- ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, NOW...

17:25.367 --> 17:28.500
HELP ME HIDE THIS
BEFORE I THROW UP INTO IT.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.400
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.733
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHE CAME IN HERE.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.333
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HOLD HER IN THERE.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.167
- "HOLD HER."
GIVE ME THAT, I'LL DO IT.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.533
WHY IS THIS HOT?
- NEVER MIND.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.933
- JUST GET INTO THE KITCHEN
AND KEEP HER OCCUPIED.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.367
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:41.367 --> 17:43.333
- YOU COULD KISS ME.
- SHUT UP.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.700
- [gasps]

17:48.700 --> 17:52.867
- HEY, IS THAT
MARIE'S CANISTER?

17:52.867 --> 17:53.933
- NO.

17:53.933 --> 17:56.467
- WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME SEE THAT.

17:56.467 --> 17:59.067
YOU DID HAVE
THAT CANISTER.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.500
SHE'S BEEN GOING ON
ABOUT THAT THING

18:00.500 --> 18:04.433
LIKE IT'S KING TUT'S
GOLDEN UNDIES.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.467
- PLEASE, FRANK,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.300
IF SHE FINDS OUT
I HAD THIS THING--

18:08.300 --> 18:12.833
- YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE,
LADY.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.867
- I-I'M BEGGING YOU, FRANK.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.567
WHAT DO I DO?

18:16.567 --> 18:20.700
- GIVE YOUR HEART TO GOD,
'CAUSE YOUR ASS IS MARIE'S.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.000
[laughs]

18:25.000 --> 18:26.600
- FRANK!
- NO, MA, MA, NO!

18:26.600 --> 18:29.667
- NO, I WANT FRANK...
- I'LL HELP WITH THE POTATOES.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.000
- TO HELP ME SET THE TABLE.
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.333
[gasps]
MY CANISTER.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.300
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

18:41.033 --> 18:44.933
- I, UH, WAS HIDING IT
FROM YOU.

18:44.933 --> 18:49.000
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUNNY.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.500
- YOU WHAT?

18:50.500 --> 18:55.000
- YEAH, I-I WAS USING IT
TO KEEP MY NUTS AND BOLTS IN.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.467
THEN WHEN I SAW YOU
CARRYING ON

18:56.467 --> 18:58.467
ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
TO FIND THE DAMN THING,

18:58.467 --> 19:01.700
I, UH, I HID IT
IN THE ATTIC.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.033
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH?

19:04.033 --> 19:07.000
- FRANK, I LOVE
THAT CANISTER.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.267
I'VE BEEN
TEARING MY HAIR OUT

19:08.267 --> 19:09.567
AND RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A CRAZY WOMAN

19:09.567 --> 19:11.033
LOOKING FOR THAT.

19:11.033 --> 19:14.233
- ALL FUNNY.

19:18.633 --> 19:20.367
- OH, REALLY, FRANK?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.067
WELL, HERE'S
WHAT'S NOT FUNNY--

19:22.067 --> 19:23.467
THIS MARRIAGE!

19:23.467 --> 19:24.600
- MARIE, I--

19:24.600 --> 19:26.133
- LET HER GO.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.467
- THIS IS SO TYPICAL
OF YOU

19:27.467 --> 19:29.267
AND YOUR SO-CALLED
SENSE OF HUMOR.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.800
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR ME WHATSOEVER,

19:31.800 --> 19:33.133
AND YOU NEVER HAVE.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.367
WELL, I PROMISE YOU
SOMETHING, FRANK.

19:35.367 --> 19:36.567
YOU WILL NOT BE
LOOKING BACK

19:36.567 --> 19:38.400
ON THIS LITTLE STUNT
AS FUNNY.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.633
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF.

19:40.633 --> 19:43.600
YOU HAVE RUINED EASTER!

19:56.800 --> 19:58.733
- FRANK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

19:58.733 --> 20:00.100
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

20:00.100 --> 20:01.733
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:01.733 --> 20:05.100
I DIDN'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.633
YOU'RE LIKE MY DAUGHTER.

20:07.633 --> 20:10.567
- OH.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.500
THANK YOU.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.800
- AND SHE WAS GOING
TO YELL AT ME

20:13.800 --> 20:15.467
LIKE THAT LATER, ANYWAY.

20:15.467 --> 20:20.667
I ATE THE BACKSIDE
OF THAT HAM.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.233
- FRANK!

20:25.767 --> 20:27.500
[news on TV]

20:27.500 --> 20:28.533
- HELLO!

20:28.533 --> 20:31.500
- OH, BOY.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.767
- THERE YOU ARE.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.067
DEBRA, COULD I SPEAK
WITH YOU A MINUTE?

20:38.067 --> 20:40.300
- YEAH, SURE, MARIE.

20:43.233 --> 20:46.233
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.500
- WHAT?
WHY?

20:48.500 --> 20:50.267
- WELL, I FELT SO BAD
FOR THINKING

20:50.267 --> 20:52.267
THAT YOU DIDN'T RETURN
THIS TO ME.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.667
- UH-HUH.
- AND TO BE HONEST,

20:54.667 --> 20:56.400
EVERY TIME I SEE IT NOW,

20:56.400 --> 20:58.733
IT MAKES ME THINK OF YOUR
FATHER-IN-LAW.

20:58.733 --> 21:02.333
SO I EITHER GIVE YOU THIS
OR GIVE YOU HIM.

21:05.233 --> 21:09.567
- THIS IS PROBABLY
EASIER TO CLEAN.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.033
- MARIE,
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

21:11.033 --> 21:12.867

I LOOK AT IT,

21:39.333 --> 21:40.633

21:46.600 --> 21:48.300
