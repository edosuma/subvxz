WEBVTT

00:05.027 --> 00:06.424
Previously on E. R.

00:06.859 --> 00:07.884
What are you saying?

00:07.885 --> 00:10.926
There's more to the emergency medicine
than treating and streeting patients.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.010
That's one more thing
you don't have to teach me.

00:13.011 --> 00:14.380
I'm still in love with him.

00:14.381 --> 00:18.014
You'll find someone, Luka. You will.
You're such wonderful man.

00:18.171 --> 00:20.198
You'll find her. You will.

00:21.687 --> 00:24.681
I told you I was allergic to sulfa.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.900
- What happened?
- She must've pulled out her IV.

00:27.935 --> 00:30.411
- Why would she pull out her IV?
- How the hell would I know that?

00:36.229 --> 00:39.004
E. R. 6x22 "MAY DAY"

00:40.719 --> 00:42.196
Multiple casualties.

00:42.212 --> 00:45.631
- All available units.
- Stand by.

01:14.330 --> 01:17.829
- Three gunshots. One's fatal.
- We should've landed earlier.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.164
The suspect was firing.

01:20.335 --> 01:22.660
- Shooting at the school?
- Everywhere.

01:22.879 --> 01:26.294
A unit responded to a robbery.
The suspects fired.

01:26.507 --> 01:27.538
I'll take this one.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.800
Where are my glasses?
Where are my glasses?

01:31.011 --> 01:32.469
- Is he alert?
- Sort of.

01:32.679 --> 01:35.964
- Name's Daniel.
- Daniel, do you know where you are?

01:36.348 --> 01:38.756
- I lost my glasses.
- Can you tell me where you are?

01:39.059 --> 01:40.090
School.

01:40.477 --> 01:44.059
- Exit wound out the right temple.
- What kind of ammunition?

01:44.230 --> 01:47.563
A large assault rifle.
Shot through the engine block.

01:47.775 --> 01:52.519
We'll never get her back with a
wound like that. Stop compressions.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.942
My dad! Somebody call my dad!

02:01.286 --> 02:03.777
- I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?
- Nicholas.

02:03.997 --> 02:05.407
Take a deep breath.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.574
Could you call my dad? Vinny Rosato.
He works at Covin.

02:09.793 --> 02:12.877
-312-54...
- How's he doing?

02:13.087 --> 02:15.625
Chest is clear.
Titrate 4 of morphine.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.591
...54- 548...

02:18.967 --> 02:21.636
Don't worry.
I'm sure the school has it.

02:21.845 --> 02:24.596
It'll take a while.
We're evacuating.

02:24.806 --> 02:25.968
Why?

02:26.182 --> 02:30.179
- There might be another suspect.
- Might be?

02:31.061 --> 02:33.100
- Can you feel your leg?
- Yeah.

02:33.271 --> 02:36.271
- It's going to sleep.
- Like pins and needles?

02:36.482 --> 02:38.605
- Paramedics?
- Coming now.

02:38.817 --> 02:41.273
- You got any Ancef?
- Red bag, side pocket.

02:41.445 --> 02:44.611
- Is yours stable?
- Bullet fragment missed the brain.

02:44.864 --> 02:45.943
What about yours?

02:46.115 --> 02:49.116
One through the groin
with a cold foot.

02:49.326 --> 02:51.615
We've got to revascularize-

02:51.995 --> 02:53.703
- Clear out!
- What?

02:53.913 --> 02:56.451
Go now!
He's in the building, coming out!

04:04.139 --> 04:06.676
- Let me examine him.
- We have to search him.

04:06.891 --> 04:10.176
- Is he still breathing?
- Yeah. He's clear.

04:10.394 --> 04:11.674
All right.

04:11.854 --> 04:14.344
- You shot him through the vest?
- Right chest.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.095
BP. I'm here to help you.
Can you talk?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.389
Go to hell.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.692
That's a "yes."
Diminished breath sounds.

04:21.904 --> 04:23.860
BP's 100/65.
His pulse is 88.

04:24.072 --> 04:26.397
Get a large bore IV.
Let's roll him.

04:27.575 --> 04:29.448
No exit wound. Chest tube.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.536
Betadine, a Steri-Drape.
Take that mask off.

04:32.746 --> 04:34.738
- You got this?
- Yeah. Lidocaine.

04:34.956 --> 04:37.625
The eye's going by ambulance,
the leg in the chopper.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.583
I might need to fly him.

04:39.794 --> 04:42.664
- Take him by ground.
- I want him stable.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.462
Go to Mercy. County has
the pediatric trauma center.

04:46.674 --> 04:49.165
Wait until I get the chest tube in.

04:49.385 --> 04:53.429
Take two units of O-neg to the chopper.
I'm loading my kid.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.346
I said, wait! Kovac!

04:55.557 --> 04:57.514
The suspect is alive.

04:57.725 --> 05:00.975
We are waiting for confirmation.

05:01.186 --> 05:04.104
This is Thalin Elementary School...

05:04.314 --> 05:06.556
- Is that Dr. Kovac?
- It's hard to say.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.227
He's too short.

05:08.401 --> 05:10.726
- Has anyone seen the toolkit?
- What?

05:10.903 --> 05:13.572
The one with the hammer,
pliers, screwdriver.

05:13.739 --> 05:14.818
What for?

05:15.157 --> 05:18.240
A guy drilled a wood screw
into his tibia.

05:18.409 --> 05:20.615
- Somebody getting that?
- Thanks.

05:21.537 --> 05:23.659
- What are you watching?
- Where have you been?

05:23.872 --> 05:26.991
Shooting near a school.
Weaver sent Benton and Kovac.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.541
- Why did they go?
- They don't get sick in the chopper.

05:30.753 --> 05:34.086
I already told you I had the flu.
Okay? I got it.

05:35.257 --> 05:39.123
- You'll take it out with a screwdriver?
- Got a better idea?

05:39.343 --> 05:42.260
MVA. Single auto versus
parking structure.

05:42.471 --> 05:43.633
- ETA?
- Five to 10.

05:44.348 --> 05:47.134
- I'll meet you in Trauma 2.
- Why do you get it?

05:47.350 --> 05:50.019
I'll call you if he needs
his oil changed.

05:50.269 --> 05:52.760
- Morning traffic's faster.
- Your call.

05:52.938 --> 05:55.180
- Pulse is weak.
- Are you still with me?

05:55.399 --> 05:58.103
- Heart rate's 120.
- Chest output 500 cc's.

05:58.276 --> 06:00.352
He's bleeding out.
A unit of O-neg.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.526
- BP's down to 70 palp.
- Follow me.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.565
- Where are you going?
- We'll transport.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.901
- Half liter bolus, then TKO.
- He's bleeding out!

06:08.117 --> 06:11.237
- What?
- He's bleeding out. I need the chopper.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.825
- Where will we put him?
- Get the boy off.

06:14.039 --> 06:17.454
- He has a pulseless leg.
- We need to revascularize.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.664
- I'm not transporting by ground.
- His pressure is crashing.

06:21.879 --> 06:23.587
- Then give him blood.
- Get out.

06:23.797 --> 06:26.039
- No way.
- My patient is more critical.

06:26.299 --> 06:29.798
- Your patient killed people.
- That's not our call!

06:31.846 --> 06:33.044
Close the door!

06:33.264 --> 06:36.217
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Open up the door!

06:36.433 --> 06:39.469
- We have to wait for him to clear.
- Stand back!

06:50.862 --> 06:53.317
- IV's in.
- That's it. I'm out of here.

06:53.530 --> 06:55.357
- Screw you!
- You're welcome.

06:55.574 --> 06:56.984
- Thank you, Doris.
- Anytime.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.279
What have you got?

06:58.451 --> 07:00.942
Combative MVA.
Ran into a parking lot booth.

07:01.204 --> 07:02.235
Get it off!

07:02.455 --> 07:03.617
- Anybody in it?
- No.

07:03.831 --> 07:06.321
- I can't breathe!
- Altered and hypertensive.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.830
- He'll need a head CT.
- Get this off!

07:09.043 --> 07:11.616
- His neck is clear.
- Remove the collar.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.500
- BP's up, 200/100.
- Okay, hold still.

07:14.715 --> 07:15.960
- Get it off.
- I am.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.588
Looks like a posterior
hip dislocation.

07:18.927 --> 07:21.844
Titrate 200 of fentanyl
and six of Versed.

07:22.305 --> 07:24.131
- I'll reduce it.
- Look.

07:24.348 --> 07:26.636
- What's wrong?
- A big goiter.

07:26.808 --> 07:29.809
- That's one of Versed.
- And 50 of fentanyl.

07:29.978 --> 07:32.303
- Don't touch me!
- Keep going.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.765
- Notice any hand tremors?
- No. He was moving.

07:35.983 --> 07:37.393
50 of fentanyl.

07:37.609 --> 07:40.526
- You think thyroid storm?
- IV Inderal, 100 PTU.

07:40.737 --> 07:41.981
He's not on drugs?

07:42.155 --> 07:46.732
- No. His thyroid is hyperactive.
- I'll kill somebody. I swear.

07:46.950 --> 07:50.069
- How much Inderal?
- Titrate a mg every two minutes.

07:50.286 --> 07:52.741
He's out.
Abby, ever reduce a hip?

07:52.955 --> 07:55.872
- No.
- It's easy. Stabilize the pelvis.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.197
From above. Up.

07:58.919 --> 08:02.334
Got it? All right, I'll pull up.
On three.

08:02.547 --> 08:05.298
One, two, three.

08:09.719 --> 08:11.842
Oh, my gosh! Carter!

08:12.680 --> 08:14.304
Are you all right?

08:16.225 --> 08:19.510
- Push another two of Versed.
- Get Malucci. He'll do this.

08:19.728 --> 08:21.008
- I can do it.
- Sit down.

08:21.229 --> 08:22.639
I said, I can do it.

08:23.356 --> 08:25.229
- Is he out this time?
- Yeah.

08:25.441 --> 08:28.441
- Don't aggravate your injury.
- Are you ready?

08:28.652 --> 08:30.229
- You ready?
- Yeah.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.982
Maintain downward pressure.
Don't be gentle.

08:33.197 --> 08:35.403
One, two, three.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.908
Okay. I got it.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.155
- Femoral head is back in place.
- Good job.

08:43.371 --> 08:46.539
- It's like falling off a horse.
- Heart rate's 110.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.164
We got a hot Ml in Curtain 3.

08:49.878 --> 08:52.036
- Got it from here?
- Hard part's over.

08:52.213 --> 08:55.546
Get him up to Radiology.
We'll get a postreduction film.

08:55.883 --> 08:56.962
Sorry about that.

08:57.176 --> 08:59.749
It takes a lot of countertraction.

09:00.553 --> 09:02.711
- Can you get him to Radiology?
- Sure.

09:03.347 --> 09:04.379
Thank you.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.790
Did I leave his chart in here?

09:42.422 --> 09:44.295
Is it over on the mayo stand?

09:46.967 --> 09:48.046
No.

09:48.927 --> 09:51.299
- Just cleaning up.
- Yeah.

09:53.431 --> 09:56.100
There it is. Over on the pulse ox.

09:56.308 --> 09:58.217
- What?
- The chart. Over there.

10:00.395 --> 10:01.558
Thanks.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.347
This is a needle stick
waiting to happen.

10:06.567 --> 10:09.022
- Can't be too careful.
- That's right.

10:09.403 --> 10:11.976
Make sure they do a head,
abdomen and pelvis.

10:12.197 --> 10:14.948
- Sure.
- Hunt me down. Let me see the films.

10:15.116 --> 10:17.108
- Okay.
- Thanks.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.782
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

10:33.089 --> 10:36.208
- What's his last pressure?
- Stable, 110/70.

10:36.425 --> 10:39.461
- How is he?
- GSW to the groin, a pulseless leg.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.801
- And the arm?
- Neurocirc is intact.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.094
- Foot sensation?
- We're losing it.

10:44.349 --> 10:48.511
- Will I lose my leg?
- Not if I can help it.

10:49.436 --> 10:53.385
Send Burns for an x-ray.
Subramaniam needs a Dilantin level.

10:53.606 --> 10:56.358
- What's that?
- Mr. Goodwrench is tuning up a patient.

10:56.567 --> 10:57.598
What?

10:58.027 --> 11:00.564
- Hold still, man.
- What are you doing?

11:00.779 --> 11:03.530
Hey, boss.
Let's take a break, okay?

11:03.740 --> 11:04.854
Okay.

11:05.408 --> 11:08.574
- Drilled a screw into his leg.
- He needs more lidocaine.

11:08.786 --> 11:11.620
Says even aspirin interferes
with his healing.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.451
- You tell him he's wrong?
- The chief even tried.

11:14.666 --> 11:17.868
If he wants to be a masochist,
he can't scream.

11:18.085 --> 11:21.999
- He'll scare other patients.
- I'll have him bite a bullet.

11:22.339 --> 11:25.125
I heard you got punted
across the trauma room.

11:25.341 --> 11:28.010
- Who told you that?
- I hear everything.

11:28.219 --> 11:29.381
- Haleh.
- Yeah.

11:31.054 --> 11:32.679
- Malucci.
- I know.

11:32.889 --> 11:36.222
- Are you hurt?
- Just knocked the wind out of me.

11:36.476 --> 11:38.931
Another tough guy.
Something rolling up?

11:39.103 --> 11:42.269
Rolling down.
The kid from the shooting.

11:42.439 --> 11:44.597
- Don't jump off a gurney.
- Yes, sir.

11:44.774 --> 11:47.395
- Did you call a Psych referral?
- What patient?

11:47.610 --> 11:49.436
- That list I gave you.
- Oh, yeah.

11:49.653 --> 11:50.816
How did it go?

11:51.321 --> 11:55.615
- Okay, I guess. Kind of tough to tell.
- It could take a while.

11:55.825 --> 11:59.359
CBC, lytes, PT, PTT,
type and cross for two units.

11:59.578 --> 12:03.326
- Can we give him morphine?
- Another 4. Chest x-ray and pelvis.

12:03.665 --> 12:04.744
You want Ancef?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.579
We are just going to take
a look at you here.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.869
Then we'll bring you upstairs.

12:10.087 --> 12:13.290
- One, two, three.
- Did they call my dad?

12:13.507 --> 12:18.334
Call the police, the school, or
whoever, to reach his father at work.

12:18.552 --> 12:21.173
It's on the news.
His dad's looking for him.

12:21.388 --> 12:23.096
- Make sure.
- Got it.

12:23.306 --> 12:26.390
- Lungs are clear.
- BP 115/75. Pulse 80.

12:26.601 --> 12:29.056
Left entrance wound.
Where's the exit?

12:29.270 --> 12:31.309
- Couldn't find one.
- The bullet's inside.

12:31.522 --> 12:34.605
- It'll be on the pelvic film.
- No pulse by Doppler.

12:34.816 --> 12:36.061
Let's look at the back.

12:36.276 --> 12:38.980
Missed everything.
I assessed it in the field.

12:39.153 --> 12:41.026
I need to examine it myself.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.065
Okay. Let's roll him.

12:43.490 --> 12:47.273
We need to move you on your side
so we can see your back.

12:50.162 --> 12:51.822
- Carter?
- Carter.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.948
- Yeah, I got it.
- Let's roll.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.328
- Did you hit your head?
- Of course. It's rugby.

13:00.504 --> 13:02.793
- Any pain in your chest or belly?
- No.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.711
I didn't want to come in.
The fellas made me.

13:05.925 --> 13:08.879
- What are you doing?
- Cutting off your shirt.

13:09.095 --> 13:10.719
We just got these jerseys.

13:10.930 --> 13:14.678
With a broken collarbone,
it'll hurt to lift your hands.

13:14.850 --> 13:17.850
Pain is relative, mate.
What was that?

13:19.895 --> 13:23.062
Someone who didn't want us
to cut off his shirt.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.643
- Right.
- Okay, Abby. Go ahead.

13:32.239 --> 13:34.278
You are blue.
Did you know that?

13:34.491 --> 13:36.898
It happens when you sweat
in these jerseys.

13:37.577 --> 13:40.613
- Maybe you should wash them first.
- It's brand-new.

13:41.539 --> 13:42.736
Okay.

13:42.915 --> 13:46.034
- Let me know if you feel any pain.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:46.251 --> 13:49.454
A mid-shaft fracture.
Looks like it's broken.

13:49.921 --> 13:53.870
- Will I be able to play next week?
- I doubt it. We'll see the x-ray.

13:54.091 --> 13:55.585
Be right back.

13:55.759 --> 13:56.921
Abby?

13:58.052 --> 13:59.879
- Get a clavicle film.
- Great.

14:00.096 --> 14:01.471
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.961
You sure?

14:04.933 --> 14:06.213
Do you have a minute?

14:06.434 --> 14:09.139
- I don't see a bullet.
- Must be in the abdomen.

14:09.353 --> 14:12.105
Let's shoot a KUB.
Your stomach doesn't hurt?

14:12.273 --> 14:13.553
It's just my leg.

14:13.774 --> 14:16.858
- PVC's on the cardiac monitor.
- Where's the chest x-ray?

14:17.068 --> 14:19.855
- Run of five.
- Bolus 60 of lidocaine.

14:20.071 --> 14:22.822
- What is it?
- Just an extra heartbeat.

14:23.032 --> 14:24.940
- You won't believe this.
- What?

14:25.158 --> 14:26.736
I found your bullet.

14:28.286 --> 14:31.121
- In his heart.
- Through the femoral vein.

14:31.289 --> 14:34.574
From there to the IVC,
to the atrium and ventricle.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.665
Tell O.R. we're on our way up.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.576
We need an open cardiac room
with a perfusionist.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.836
- He may need a bypass.
- I got it.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.373
Revascularize the leg
at the same time.

14:45.592 --> 14:48.213
Put him in right lateral decubitus,
reverse Trendelenberg.

14:48.428 --> 14:50.337
We don't want it
to embolize into the lung.

14:50.555 --> 14:52.630
- We need to move you.
- What's wrong?

14:52.848 --> 14:55.635
Remember I said we would
take you upstairs?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.642
Well, we're going now.

15:00.063 --> 15:02.269
Hey, good effort.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.806
College student,
stabbed in the abdomen.

15:07.068 --> 15:08.100
Hey, Peter.

15:08.319 --> 15:09.944
200 cc's in the Foley.

15:10.154 --> 15:12.645
Type and cross for six units.
Two of FFP.

15:12.865 --> 15:14.904
She'll fix you up.
Hang in there.

15:15.117 --> 15:16.990
- You'll get my dad?
- I will.

15:17.202 --> 15:19.111
Send up the O-neg
if they need it.

15:19.329 --> 15:22.697
- Elizabeth needs a surgeon.
- Congratulations. He's dead.

15:22.915 --> 15:24.457
- Who?
- The man he abandoned.

15:24.667 --> 15:28.117
- I didn't.
- He went into asystole near Mercy.

15:28.336 --> 15:31.088
- It was too late.
-10 minutes would've mattered?

15:31.297 --> 15:33.373
- We won't know.
- The shooter?

15:33.591 --> 15:36.461
The most critical patient
is the priority!

15:36.677 --> 15:40.923
A bullet's in his heart! It can
embolize and he'll lose his leg.

15:41.139 --> 15:43.594
Debate this later.
Peter, get upstairs.

15:43.808 --> 15:45.883
Elizabeth needs some help!

15:46.101 --> 15:49.018
- You didn't care!
- I was caring for the boy!

15:49.187 --> 15:51.345
That's enough! That's enough.

15:51.522 --> 15:53.764
Kerry, I need to talk to you.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.640
- I can't believe that guy!
- BP 118/78.

15:56.860 --> 15:59.351
- Can you describe him?
- It happened fast.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.854
Get an ultrasound and fetal monitor.

16:02.031 --> 16:04.522
- Do you need some help?
- Yeah, I might.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.731
It's important.

16:05.951 --> 16:09.319
- He needed to get to a trauma center!
- Calm down.

16:09.537 --> 16:13.237
I'm supposed to delay care while
they take the shooter?

16:13.457 --> 16:15.414
- Go help Cleo!
- One, two, three.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.914
Can you give me
a physical description?

16:18.128 --> 16:21.378
- He was darker. Maybe Mexican.
- What is it?

16:21.547 --> 16:25.165
Single right stab wound
to the lower right quadrant...

16:25.384 --> 16:27.423
...four centimeters
off the midline.

16:27.636 --> 16:31.051
- What was he wearing?
- A gray sweatshirt, I think.

16:31.222 --> 16:33.713
Full trauma panel
and check a HemoCue.

16:33.891 --> 16:36.845
- How far along are you, miss?
- What?

16:37.060 --> 16:39.681
- What month are you in?
- What do you mean?

16:39.896 --> 16:43.478
- Your pregnancy. When are you due?
- I'm not pregnant.

16:44.692 --> 16:47.099
- You're eight months.
- Got the ultrasound.

16:47.319 --> 16:50.569
- Better cath a urine.
- Anything else you can tell me?

16:50.780 --> 16:53.449
No. He just ran up,
grabbed my purse.

16:53.658 --> 16:57.240
- When I didn't let go, he stabbed me.
- Okay. I'll be back.

16:57.411 --> 17:00.660
- Fetal heart tones are 142.
- HemoCue's 13.4.

17:00.872 --> 17:03.244
- No intra-abdominal bleed.
- The baby?

17:03.416 --> 17:06.333
32-week size.
Good cardiac activity.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.536
- I'm pregnant?
- Very.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.296
Oh, my God!

17:11.047 --> 17:13.252
- Hold on.
- What?

17:13.424 --> 17:15.713
- There. A blood clot.
- Abruption?

17:16.218 --> 17:17.333
Could be.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.712
Twelve milligrams
of betamethasone.

17:20.222 --> 17:21.597
Don't tell my parents.

17:22.265 --> 17:25.218
- What's your name?
- Gloria. Gloria Milton.

17:25.434 --> 17:29.266
The stab wound damaged
the placenta, causing it to bleed.

17:29.479 --> 17:33.346
- It cuts off oxygen to your baby.
- I didn't know I had one.

17:33.566 --> 17:36.104
You do. Right now it looks okay.

17:36.318 --> 17:38.939
But we may need to do a C-section.

17:39.112 --> 17:41.899
- You mean cut me open?
- Yes. 32 weeks is early.

17:42.157 --> 17:45.323
You're on steroids
to help the baby's lungs.

17:45.534 --> 17:48.784
- I don't want an operation.
- It may not be a choice.

17:48.996 --> 17:53.491
- The baby will die.
- Nothing bad will happen to me?

17:54.292 --> 17:56.782
- Now you're all right. But-
- Then don't.

17:56.961 --> 17:59.795
Don't cut me open.
Don't do anything.

18:03.299 --> 18:06.086
- Hey, it's Dr. Torquemada.
- Who?

18:06.302 --> 18:09.136
Nothing. Did you discharge
your screamer yet?

18:09.304 --> 18:12.139
- It was tough.
- You couldn't tell from out here.

18:12.307 --> 18:15.722
- He took on the hurt and won.
- No brain, no pain?

18:15.935 --> 18:19.101
Some cultures see pain
as a rite of passage.

18:20.022 --> 18:23.141
- Somebody call a staff meeting?
- No.

18:24.692 --> 18:28.855
The kid made it up to the O.R.
Benton's working on the leg.

18:29.071 --> 18:30.150
Good. Thanks.

18:30.322 --> 18:34.817
Age 13, the Masai warriors scar
themselves with red-hot spears...

18:34.992 --> 18:38.443
...and yank out their bottom
teeth, with no Novocain.

18:38.662 --> 18:40.619
Dave, give us a minute?

18:40.831 --> 18:43.831
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Sorry.
- Carter, hold on.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.710
- What's up?
- I think you know.

18:50.922 --> 18:54.457
The guy leaves a millimeter
of coffee in the pot.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.963
- Abby saw you.
- She saw me what?

18:58.762 --> 18:59.960
Abby.

19:01.556 --> 19:04.343
I saw you inject the fentanyl.

19:05.309 --> 19:09.009
- What?
- In the trauma room, cleaning up.

19:11.314 --> 19:12.346
I was cleaning up.

19:12.566 --> 19:16.610
Chart says you drew up
200 of fentanyl into the syringe.

19:16.819 --> 19:20.022
- What is this?
- You gave 150 mics to the patient.

19:20.531 --> 19:22.570
Okay. Hold on. Slow down.

19:23.241 --> 19:26.111
- This is a mistake.
- You stopped after three cc's.

19:26.327 --> 19:28.284
Haleh gave him a bunch of Versed.

19:28.496 --> 19:32.493
- And the rest of the fentanyl?
- Must have wasted it down the sink.

19:32.707 --> 19:35.376
Somebody needs to witness
you doing that.

19:35.543 --> 19:38.579
Come on. Come on.
We do that all the time.

19:38.796 --> 19:41.417
We have a protocol for disposal
of narcotics.

19:41.632 --> 19:45.498
Fine. Whatever. That doesn't mean
that I injected it.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.259
Abby, if you thought
you saw something...

19:54.601 --> 19:56.723
...why wouldn't you come talk to me?

19:56.936 --> 20:00.186
- It's appropriate to come to us.
- Not when she's wrong!

20:00.397 --> 20:01.891
Are you still on medication?

20:03.066 --> 20:05.354
- Why? What?
- For your back.

20:05.568 --> 20:07.110
Why? A little. Why?

20:07.320 --> 20:10.439
- What's "a little"?
- That's between me and my doctor.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.695
So you're not overmedicating?

20:15.160 --> 20:16.867
You think I'm a drug addict?

20:18.621 --> 20:21.158
Do you honestly think
I'm a drug addict?

20:21.373 --> 20:25.417
That I sneak around, injecting
whatever narcotics I find?

20:27.753 --> 20:30.624
You guys, you know me.
This is ridiculous.

20:30.839 --> 20:33.756
- So you deny this?
- Yes, I deny it! Abby!

20:34.342 --> 20:37.129
I think you're seeing things.

20:38.012 --> 20:41.297
Maybe you're on drugs.
I saw you with a needle once.

20:41.515 --> 20:44.634
If this is a misunderstanding,
I apologize.

20:44.851 --> 20:46.428
This is a misunderstanding.

20:47.437 --> 20:49.096
You know why we had to ask you.

20:51.315 --> 20:52.975
Can I go back to work now?

20:58.988 --> 21:00.150
Thank you.

21:01.573 --> 21:04.776
And thank you, Abby.
I really appreciate that.

21:09.288 --> 21:11.909
- He's lying, Mark.
- I know.

21:15.585 --> 21:18.502
We'll call someone you can talk to.

21:18.713 --> 21:22.496
- It can be a friend, a roommate-
- I don't want to talk to anyone.

21:22.716 --> 21:26.334
We don't have time. To save
that baby, we need to operate.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.628
I told you I don't want it.

21:28.805 --> 21:31.639
Give it up for adoption.
No one would know.

21:31.849 --> 21:36.759
I don't want an operation.
So just leave me alone! All of you!

21:36.978 --> 21:39.433
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Leave me alone!

21:39.647 --> 21:42.138
But you'll have to keep monitors on.

21:42.358 --> 21:44.101
- Why?
- For your own safety.

21:44.568 --> 21:47.319
We need to know if you
bleed internally.

21:47.487 --> 21:48.815
Dr. Kovac?

21:49.989 --> 21:53.986
Spin another crit. Cycle
the dynamap every five minutes.

21:54.826 --> 21:56.949
I thought I'd seen everything.

21:57.162 --> 21:59.913
- Are you taking her?
- Not if she says no.

22:00.122 --> 22:04.119
The abruption is progressing.
She needs a C-section.

22:04.334 --> 22:07.537
- I made the consequences clear.
- She doesn't care.

22:07.754 --> 22:10.505
You can't cut a woman open
without her consent.

22:10.673 --> 22:12.914
- The baby will die.
- I'm aware of that.

22:13.133 --> 22:15.671
- You can watch it happen?
- There's nothing I can do.

22:15.886 --> 22:18.174
- You can operate.
- No, I can't.

22:18.346 --> 22:21.512
- I'm calling another OB.
- I am the department head.

22:21.682 --> 22:25.513
- We don't force C-sections.
- What if she's incompetent?

22:25.727 --> 22:27.518
I don't know.
She seemed coherent.

22:27.729 --> 22:31.643
- I think the wound was self-inflicted.
- You can prove that?

22:31.857 --> 22:34.858
She claims she didn't know
she was pregnant.

22:35.027 --> 22:37.315
She was lying, not crazy.

22:37.529 --> 22:41.857
What woman carries for 8 months,
then won't let us help her baby?

22:42.032 --> 22:44.072
Call Psych. Give it a shot.

22:44.284 --> 22:47.036
- Then I can bring her up?
- If they say yes.

22:47.829 --> 22:49.537
Side-biting clamp.

22:51.374 --> 22:53.200
5-0 Prolene.

22:54.168 --> 22:56.919
We're lucky to have this extra time.

22:57.128 --> 22:59.880
Kovac didn't know the bullet
moved to his heart.

23:00.048 --> 23:03.582
I'd have trouble helping someone
who shoots at playgrounds.

23:03.801 --> 23:06.208
- BP's down, 80 palp.
- Is that you?

23:06.928 --> 23:08.885
No. No active bleeding.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.883
Femoral vessels are clamped.
Recheck the pressure.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.928
- Still falling, 70 palp.
- What is it?

23:15.477 --> 23:17.516
Did the bullet embolize?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.395
Fluoroscope on.

23:25.652 --> 23:28.902
It is moving closer
to the pulmonary artery.

23:29.114 --> 23:31.189
- We have blood dripping!
- Where from?

23:31.407 --> 23:33.565
Take the towel off his shoulder.

23:34.368 --> 23:36.609
- He's bleeding out!
- Saline sponge now!

23:36.828 --> 23:39.401
We need six more units
of packed cells!

23:40.248 --> 23:41.410
What are you doing?

23:41.582 --> 23:43.740
- Locating the source.
- I opened his heart.

23:43.959 --> 23:46.450
- We need to stop the bleeding.
- Just wait!

23:46.670 --> 23:47.915
- Clamp the auricle.
- I can't!

23:48.129 --> 23:49.161
Just for a second.

23:49.380 --> 23:52.464
The other bullet hit the artery.
Clamp the subclavian.

23:52.675 --> 23:55.510
- I need to get this bullet out.
- I'll do it myself.

23:55.719 --> 23:59.586
- Pressure's down to 60.
- Give him a saline bolus.

23:59.764 --> 24:03.382
Come on. Damn it!
I can't reach the artery.

24:04.185 --> 24:07.019
Crank the sternum open
a little wider.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.019
He's in V-fib! Paddles! Paddles!

24:11.024 --> 24:12.850
- Get your hands out.
- Hold on.

24:13.067 --> 24:15.984
- Clear! Now!
- Got it. Go.

24:19.656 --> 24:20.984
I don't know what to tell you.

24:21.157 --> 24:23.529
I can't miss the tournament
next week.

24:23.743 --> 24:25.818
You've broken your collarbone.

24:25.994 --> 24:29.612
Aside from hurting yourself,
you'd be useless on the field.

24:29.831 --> 24:31.111
Put a cast on it.

24:31.332 --> 24:34.665
- We sling it and you rest.
- It can't be that bad.

24:34.835 --> 24:39.543
- Could you get him a sling?
- We only have smalls. He's large.

24:39.756 --> 24:42.507
- Hey, Mark.
- Make that extra-large, mate.

24:42.675 --> 24:44.714
I'll be back to discharge you.

24:49.514 --> 24:51.091
So I talked to Legal.

24:51.307 --> 24:54.842
- Did you use his name?
- No. I spoke in hypotheticals.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.100
Bottom line,
we need more evidence.

24:57.312 --> 25:01.012
- He can't treat patients, right?
- We have to be careful.

25:01.191 --> 25:02.649
How about a drug test?

25:03.276 --> 25:06.312
He's on medication.
He'll test positive.

25:06.528 --> 25:09.731
I'm afraid just asking
will push him further away.

25:09.948 --> 25:12.735
- What do you wanna do?
- Get him some help.

25:15.828 --> 25:19.576
Let me talk to him. He might
open up if it's not a threat.

25:19.789 --> 25:24.000
How could we have let this happen?
He showed all the signs.

25:24.210 --> 25:25.620
I know. I know.

25:25.961 --> 25:29.164
But it's Carter.
Your mind just doesn't go there.

25:36.637 --> 25:39.306
She's a little calmer.
That's a good sign.

25:39.848 --> 25:42.054
- He'll talk her into it.
- How do you know?

25:42.267 --> 25:44.259
- He has to.
- Dr. Kovac.

25:44.477 --> 25:47.726
- Yeah?
- Vinny Rosato. The boy's father.

25:48.272 --> 25:50.727
Oh, yes, yes.
Hi, Mr. Rosato.

25:51.399 --> 25:53.854
- Your son is in surgery.
- How bad is it?

25:54.068 --> 25:56.060
He was shot
in the leg and the shoulder.

25:56.278 --> 25:59.065
The surgeons will repair
those injuries.

25:59.239 --> 26:03.532
- A bullet moved to his heart.
- He was shot in the heart?

26:03.743 --> 26:06.115
No. The bullet swept
through the vein.

26:06.328 --> 26:09.115
But there shouldn't be
any tissue damage.

26:09.331 --> 26:10.955
Can they get it out?

26:12.834 --> 26:16.368
We should take you upstairs.
You can get updated information.

26:16.587 --> 26:18.793
- I'll take you.
- Thank you, Cleo.

26:20.382 --> 26:22.458
She's certainly
emotionally distraught.

26:22.675 --> 26:26.126
She could be depressed
with a personality disorder.

26:26.345 --> 26:29.429
- Is she incompetent?
- She's not psychotic.

26:29.598 --> 26:33.761
She understands not having
the C-section can endanger her baby.

26:33.935 --> 26:36.604
- You mean kill it.
- She's willing to risk it.

26:36.771 --> 26:38.977
It's no risk.
She wants it to happen.

26:39.189 --> 26:42.723
- She stabbed herself.
- You have no evidence.

26:42.942 --> 26:44.686
- She's a danger to others.
- Who?

26:44.902 --> 26:46.100
The baby.

26:46.279 --> 26:49.445
Doesn't count.
It's still her body.

26:49.781 --> 26:53.565
- Is the C-section needed for her?
- There has to be a point.

26:53.785 --> 26:54.947
Is it?

26:55.661 --> 26:56.692
No.

26:57.788 --> 27:00.195
Without a court order,
you can't touch her.

27:00.415 --> 27:03.784
I don't have time.
That baby needs to come out now.

27:04.002 --> 27:07.500
We can try to expedite it.
We know friendly judges.

27:07.713 --> 27:11.164
- You have to write up an affidavit.
- Yeah. Whatever.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.219
When did you start smoking?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.932
That depends.
Does it make me a druggie?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.806
Ask the Surgeon General.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.391
I'm worried about you, Carter.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.647
I'm okay.

27:34.819 --> 27:38.982
I got angry when I shouldn't have.
Not that I didn't have a right.

27:39.323 --> 27:40.437
I'm okay.

27:41.408 --> 27:43.484
You didn't talk to anyone, did you?

27:43.702 --> 27:45.279
Any psychiatrists?

27:47.621 --> 27:49.661
- No.
- Why not?

27:50.833 --> 27:52.825
I didn't feel like talking.

27:54.586 --> 27:58.452
I'm gonna be fine. Or I hope-
I will be.

27:58.839 --> 28:01.330
It's been rough.
You can understand.

28:01.508 --> 28:04.177
I got stabbed twice
with a butcher knife.

28:05.303 --> 28:07.176
I'm in a lot of pain.

28:08.222 --> 28:11.970
This place isn't exactly
the easiest work environment.

28:13.685 --> 28:16.555
Lucy's dead, partly my fault.
I can't sleep.

28:16.771 --> 28:20.388
I had to take more pain medication
just to function.

28:24.402 --> 28:27.189
I didn't steal it.
It was prescribed to me.

28:27.405 --> 28:30.987
- Did you take the prescribed amount?
- Yeah. More or less.

28:35.328 --> 28:37.202
I think you need help, Carter.

28:37.997 --> 28:41.946
I understand that you have to
make this your business.

28:42.167 --> 28:45.168
But please,
please let me deal with it.

28:45.378 --> 28:48.379
- When are you off?
- Midnight.

28:49.173 --> 28:53.668
I don't want you to see any
patients. Work on QA chart reviews.

28:53.885 --> 28:57.218
- I can see patients-
- You have to trust me.

28:59.974 --> 29:02.215
Let me figure this out.

29:21.116 --> 29:22.575
We got to write this one up.

29:22.784 --> 29:25.904
That you lifted him up
while I was operating?

29:26.079 --> 29:28.320
Cranking his chest and suturing too.

29:28.539 --> 29:30.994
- I have moves you haven't seen.
- Oh, yeah?

29:31.208 --> 29:33.331
- Dibs on the bullet.
- It's mine.

29:33.543 --> 29:35.999
- I was the one that called it.
- I fished it out.

29:36.212 --> 29:37.291
- But I-
- Hi, Cleo.

29:37.505 --> 29:40.209
- We just made a great save.
- I can see that.

29:40.424 --> 29:44.338
We got the bullet out and
Peter saved his arm and leg.

29:44.678 --> 29:47.050
His father's waiting
to talk to someone.

29:47.263 --> 29:48.591
Okay. I'll do it.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.214
What's wrong?

29:53.060 --> 29:54.305
Nothing.

30:06.112 --> 30:09.695
I didn't know what to do,
so I asked Dr. Greene. Sorry.

30:10.950 --> 30:13.784
I don't know you, but
you're a good doctor.

30:13.952 --> 30:17.652
You've been through a lot
that I couldn't handle.

30:17.872 --> 30:20.114
But I felt I had to tell them.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.166
You feel better?

30:26.796 --> 30:28.125
I have work to do.

30:36.012 --> 30:40.923
Here's your prescription.
Take one every six hours for pain.

30:41.142 --> 30:45.684
You're gonna want to ice it.
Mr. Tanner? Mr. Tanner?

30:45.896 --> 30:47.769
- Get Dr. Greene!
- What is it?

30:47.981 --> 30:50.306
He barely has a pulse.
I need a BP.

30:50.483 --> 30:54.776
- What did he present with?
- Fractured clavicle.

30:55.153 --> 30:58.818
Tension pneumo. Get a 14-gauge
needle on an open syringe.

30:59.073 --> 31:00.104
Let's go.

31:00.324 --> 31:03.360
- BP's 50 palp. Betadine?
- Yep.

31:03.577 --> 31:05.984
Quickly, quickly.
Get him on a pulse ox.

31:09.290 --> 31:11.959
I got it. Okay, check a pulse.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.991
Stronger.

31:14.169 --> 31:16.660
- A chest tube.
- It's a broken collarbone.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.338
Not anymore.

31:18.756 --> 31:20.298
Satting at 95.

31:21.342 --> 31:23.465
Okay. Get me a 10-blade.

31:24.845 --> 31:27.466
- What are you doing?
- Saving this guy's life.

31:27.681 --> 31:30.764
- You missed a rib fracture.
- I'll take it from here.

31:30.975 --> 31:32.848
Needle decompressed.
I need a Kelly.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.218
- I got it.
- I'm almost in.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.307
Right, right. You take it.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.026
32 French.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.196
- Suction's ready.
- BP's 100/60.

31:54.870 --> 31:56.281
You're welcome.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.035
I'm in. Hook me up.

32:02.376 --> 32:03.455
Abby.

32:05.963 --> 32:08.999
Call as soon as you know.
Thank you.

32:09.215 --> 32:11.208
- He didn't sign?
- They got there at 6:30.

32:11.384 --> 32:14.005
He had left.
The clerk is tracking him down.

32:14.220 --> 32:16.710
- Can't we try another judge?
- They're working on that.

32:16.930 --> 32:19.966
- I can't wait.
- You can't do anything until we get it.

32:20.183 --> 32:23.432
- I've waited too long.
- Promise me you won't do anything.

32:23.644 --> 32:25.720
No. I'm going to change her mind.

32:29.733 --> 32:32.437
- We need to do this tonight.
- I don't believe it.

32:32.652 --> 32:35.818
He's so unpredictable.
I thought he was bipolar.

32:36.029 --> 32:38.864
- No way.
- He as much as admitted it to me.

32:39.074 --> 32:42.987
He's using. I don't know how long,
but the behavior's there.

32:43.202 --> 32:46.902
But is this the right way?
He might feel ganged up on.

32:47.122 --> 32:49.957
It's either this or we go
to some committee.

32:50.166 --> 32:55.077
I'd rather approach him as a small
group so he can clear it up.

32:55.421 --> 32:59.204
- And what about Romano?
- No. We don't want him in.

32:59.424 --> 33:01.500
He can be stubborn.
He might walk out.

33:01.718 --> 33:05.584
We'll be prepared.
We'll be compassionate, but clear.

33:05.763 --> 33:08.088
He has two options. That's it.

33:11.267 --> 33:13.094
Are you with us, Peter?

33:14.812 --> 33:16.092
Kerry?

33:16.772 --> 33:18.930
- You needed me?
- Yeah, Don.

33:19.399 --> 33:22.768
- What's the big emergency?
- Have a seat.

33:24.695 --> 33:28.194
- Fetal heart rate down to 60.
- Get a baby warmer.

33:28.615 --> 33:32.778
We don't have time to argue.
This baby needs to come out.

33:32.994 --> 33:36.445
- I want another doctor.
- You'll hemorrhage to death.

33:36.622 --> 33:37.736
You're trying to scare me.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.574
You should be scared.
If not the baby, think of yourself.

33:41.793 --> 33:44.118
I don't believe you.
You would've helped.

33:44.337 --> 33:45.879
Heart rate's down to 50.

33:46.380 --> 33:49.795
You're having a boy.
I can tell from the ultrasound.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.675
You want to kill your son?

33:51.885 --> 33:54.340
Leave me alone.
I want another doctor!

33:54.554 --> 33:56.131
Down to 40.

33:57.097 --> 33:59.505
That's it.
100 of ketamine, IV push.

33:59.725 --> 34:00.756
Dr. Kovac.

34:01.267 --> 34:03.556
- Draw up the ketamine.
- You can't.

34:03.811 --> 34:05.768
I'll take full responsibility!

34:05.980 --> 34:07.557
- What are you doing?
- Don't.

34:07.773 --> 34:10.145
I don't want the baby!

34:10.525 --> 34:13.194
- C-section tray.
- I don't want the baby!

34:13.402 --> 34:16.522
- Heart rate's down to 20.
- Please, help me!

34:16.739 --> 34:18.731
- Cleo, set up the suction.
- I won't.

34:18.949 --> 34:22.531
- Then get out of the way!
- You'll lose your license.

34:22.744 --> 34:24.321
-10-blade!
- Lost the heart rate.

34:24.495 --> 34:27.946
You can't do this.
You can't.

34:38.799 --> 34:40.174
Is it over?

34:51.560 --> 34:53.635
Carter, got a minute?

34:54.853 --> 34:58.898
No. I'm done. If I can't
see patients, I'll go home.

34:59.108 --> 35:01.563
Not yet. I need to talk to you.

35:02.944 --> 35:05.565
- Is this my suspension?
- Not here. Come on.

35:23.128 --> 35:25.416
Oh, God! Give me a break.

35:25.630 --> 35:27.752
Carter, just listen.

35:27.965 --> 35:31.630
I'm on painkillers for my back.
But I'm functioning.

35:31.843 --> 35:33.503
Dr. Carter?

35:34.596 --> 35:37.549
You would be wise to be quiet
and listen.

35:42.269 --> 35:46.135
My van is parked outside.
We have a ticket to Atlanta.

35:47.023 --> 35:49.145
There is a drug rehab...

35:51.443 --> 35:56.437
The drug rehab center there treats
doctors with addiction.

35:56.656 --> 35:58.447
I'm on prescribed painkillers.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.113
That doesn't make me an addict.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.779
I'm not finished.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.164
It's apparent to us that
you have a drug problem.

36:07.415 --> 36:12.076
We can't allow you to continue working
here or anywhere else as a physician.

36:12.294 --> 36:14.535
So you have two choices.

36:14.754 --> 36:19.214
Get in the van, go to the airport,
check yourself in.

36:19.425 --> 36:23.636
And when you come back, we'll
support you in any way we can.

36:25.722 --> 36:27.299
Or I'm fired?

36:28.307 --> 36:29.338
Yeah.

36:32.894 --> 36:35.136
Everyone in this room cares about you.

36:36.064 --> 36:41.021
- No one is judging you.
- You are. You've already judged me.

36:41.568 --> 36:45.861
You have no idea what I've been
through. But I've showed up.

36:46.114 --> 36:48.402
I haven't made excuses
or complained.

36:48.616 --> 36:50.655
- That's not the point-
- It is!

36:50.868 --> 36:54.734
Can anybody tell me that
I have endangered patients?

36:55.872 --> 37:00.118
Can anybody here say that
my performance has changed?

37:02.169 --> 37:04.410
That I'm a liability?

37:05.547 --> 37:10.089
You put a patient into anaphylactic
shock by giving her Bactrim...

37:10.301 --> 37:13.254
...when she said
she was allergic to it.

37:13.428 --> 37:18.552
You left a wire in someone's chest.
Is this about mistakes?

37:20.351 --> 37:23.055
We all make mistakes.
I saved you today.

37:23.270 --> 37:27.314
John, you've demonstrated compulsive
drug-seeking behavior.

37:27.523 --> 37:30.559
- Tell me when.
- Mainlining fentanyl.

37:30.776 --> 37:35.022
I didn't do that. Call me a liar,
fine. I didn't do that.

37:35.238 --> 37:37.029
- Show us your wrists.
- What?

37:37.240 --> 37:38.520
Show us your wrists!

37:43.453 --> 37:45.825
Are we looking for track marks?

37:46.706 --> 37:48.034
Yeah.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.203
Well, there. See?

37:51.418 --> 37:55.368
- You want me to roll up my sleeves?
- Take off your watch.

38:01.802 --> 38:02.917
You know...

38:03.470 --> 38:05.795
You know what?
Forget it. Forget it.

38:06.014 --> 38:08.765
- This is your only chance.
- I quit.

38:12.436 --> 38:13.515
Well...

38:15.021 --> 38:16.397
Is that it?

38:17.982 --> 38:19.061
No.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.319
What are you doing?

38:28.866 --> 38:32.151
I don't need this.
I've never needed this.

38:32.369 --> 38:36.201
I wanted to be a doctor, wanted to
help people. I don't need their job.

38:36.414 --> 38:39.201
- Don't do this.
- I'm not doing it. They are.

38:42.878 --> 38:44.669
- Carter, wait!
- No.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.714
You want to piss it away?
All you've worked for?

38:47.924 --> 38:51.672
- You're handing out the ultimatums!
- Get in that van!

38:51.844 --> 38:54.169
- Like hell I am.
- You won't do this!

38:54.346 --> 38:57.679
You believe I'm a junkie?
You ambush me.

38:57.891 --> 39:01.140
You're out of control!
Get into that van.

39:01.352 --> 39:02.632
- No.
- Get in the van.

39:02.853 --> 39:05.095
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

39:07.607 --> 39:09.101
Where does it end?

39:11.277 --> 39:14.028
It's fentanyl, then you're dead.
Or like your cousin...

39:14.196 --> 39:16.865
...some babbling gork
in a nursing home.

39:21.452 --> 39:25.034
You want to fight, that's cool,
but get in the van.

39:45.556 --> 39:47.097
It's all right, man.

39:50.476 --> 39:52.101
It's all right, Carter.

40:01.027 --> 40:02.770
Good job. That's good.

40:03.154 --> 40:06.154
- He's crowning.
- Almost there. One more push.

40:06.365 --> 40:08.902
Ready? And push.

40:10.743 --> 40:12.071
Push.

40:13.287 --> 40:14.698
The head is out.

40:15.539 --> 40:17.412
Okay. You can stop now.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.201
Clamp.

40:28.091 --> 40:29.751
And cut.

40:48.942 --> 40:52.986
- Does she want to see him?
- Would you like to see him?

40:55.030 --> 40:56.275
No.

41:01.411 --> 41:04.411
- You want me to pronounce him?
- No. I'll do it.

41:12.420 --> 41:15.420
Time of death, 19:47.

41:27.933 --> 41:29.261
Is he on the plane?

41:29.476 --> 41:31.848
- Peter hasn't called.
- Wonder what he said?

41:32.061 --> 41:34.137
- I just hope Carter goes.
- Yeah.

41:34.355 --> 41:38.482
Nice to see the ER brain trust
diligently works after hours.

41:38.650 --> 41:41.769
- Hello, Robert.
- ICU's a zoo. It's nice here.

41:41.986 --> 41:43.813
- Same old stuff.
- Fun never stops.

41:44.030 --> 41:47.480
- Walt, the intussusception upstairs.
- What about him?

41:47.699 --> 41:51.364
Tried to reduce with an enema.
Big mess. We must go in.

41:52.287 --> 41:53.449
- Now?
- Yeah.

41:53.663 --> 41:58.657
Not as sexy as a bullet out of the
heart, but it's a life-saving procedure.

41:58.834 --> 42:01.371
- I'll be right up.
- Thank you.

42:03.796 --> 42:05.076
Good night, all.

42:10.677 --> 42:13.002
- I guess I lost my ride.
- That's right.

42:13.304 --> 42:14.335
I'll take the El.

42:14.514 --> 42:16.305
- You sure?
- Yeah. See you at home.

42:16.315 --> 42:19.006
I'll try not to wake you.
Good night.

42:19.226 --> 42:20.388
Good night.

42:21.728 --> 42:24.053
Wanna go get something to eat?

42:24.272 --> 42:26.679
No. I'll wait to hear
that he got on.

42:26.899 --> 42:28.393
- Call me.
- Okay.

42:28.817 --> 42:29.848
Thanks.

42:30.027 --> 42:32.398
- Just a minute. Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

42:32.612 --> 42:37.487
Legal on line 3. They say to go ahead,
the judge signed the order.
