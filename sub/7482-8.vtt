WEBVTT

00:51.599 --> 00:53.363
And bingo.

01:17.992 --> 01:19.050
Drop the gun.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.724
Stop!

02:28.663 --> 02:31.064
Ah. Nice cabinets.

02:31.232 --> 02:33.064
- You built those yourself?
- From scratch.

02:33.234 --> 02:36.067
- Wow. How long did that take?
- About a month.

02:36.237 --> 02:37.261
- A month?
- Yeah.

02:37.438 --> 02:39.304
Why didn't you just hire
a professional?

02:39.474 --> 02:41.674
I spent a fraction of what it'd cost
by doing it myself.

02:41.809 --> 02:44.608
Yeah, but you spent quadruple
the time a professional would have.

02:44.779 --> 02:45.803
And what's your point?

02:45.980 --> 02:47.700
Well, my point is that
if you'd hired a pro,

02:47.849 --> 02:50.009
you could've spent more time
doing the things you love.

02:50.151 --> 02:53.121
Yeah, and by doing it myself, I saved
more money for the ones I love.

02:53.454 --> 02:54.546
I just don't get it.

02:54.722 --> 02:56.383
Of course, you don't.
You don't have kids.

02:56.991 --> 02:58.584
I mean,
what do you spend money on?

02:59.060 --> 03:02.394
We have the same salary.
Hetty practically gave you a house.

03:02.563 --> 03:04.156
And yet I'm always picking up
the check.

03:04.332 --> 03:06.630
Who am I to deny your generosity?

03:06.801 --> 03:10.237
Besides, this is about your inability
to relinquish control

03:10.405 --> 03:11.736
and hire a professional.

03:12.407 --> 03:14.842
Am I hearing that Sam
is DIY'ing again?

03:15.009 --> 03:17.808
Oh, yeah. He just spent a month
building some shelves.

03:17.979 --> 03:19.003
Cabinets.

03:19.180 --> 03:21.478
- It was only a couple of weeks.
- Now, you said a month.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.009
Why don't you hire a professional?

03:23.151 --> 03:25.313
- Take that time for yourself to relax.
- Exactly.

03:25.486 --> 03:27.246
This coming from another one
who lives alone.

03:27.388 --> 03:30.289
- What?
- Building relaxes me.

03:30.458 --> 03:34.019
Besides, it's good for a man to know
that he can create with his hands.

03:34.195 --> 03:35.424
I use my hands.

03:35.596 --> 03:38.122
I use my hands to pick up the phone
and call a professional.

03:38.299 --> 03:41.792
And then I use my hand to use my
credit card and pay that professional.

03:41.969 --> 03:44.370
- Where's the fun in that?
- I'll tell you where the fun is.

03:44.539 --> 03:48.169
The fun is in the, uh, mojitos
that we're sipping

03:48.343 --> 03:50.539
while the guy that we're paying
is doing the work.

03:50.712 --> 03:53.190
- That's what I'm talking about.
- That's what I'm talking about.

03:53.214 --> 03:55.012
No, I totally agree with Sam.

03:55.183 --> 03:57.982
A woman likes a guy
who can build things. It's sexy.

03:58.152 --> 04:00.519
It stems from a primal attraction
for shelter.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.568
I built a tree house once.
How is that for sexy?

04:02.724 --> 04:04.283
I guarantee that's not still standing.

04:04.459 --> 04:07.087
- Maybe not, but it's where I lost my...
- TMI.

04:07.495 --> 04:10.624
Grip. I was gonna say it's where I lost
my grip. Fell down, broke my coccyx.

04:10.798 --> 04:13.130
- I got a scar. You wanna see it?
- No.

04:16.303 --> 04:19.797
Is that... Morse code?

04:19.974 --> 04:21.839
We got a case.

04:22.009 --> 04:23.374
Eric.

04:24.412 --> 04:25.709
He's calling us up to Ops.

04:26.547 --> 04:28.481
I think it's time for an intervention.

04:28.649 --> 04:29.741
Good luck with that.

04:29.917 --> 04:32.352
I have a small window
to contact the Molina cartel informant.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.182
- I'm gonna take it.
- I'll cover you in Ops.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.557
- What are you doing?
- It's like a gentle massage.

04:38.726 --> 04:41.161
- To my glutes.
- Ew.

04:41.329 --> 04:43.661
What? I did squats this morning.

04:43.831 --> 04:45.856
Yeah? Couple of ya-ho-ho.

04:46.033 --> 04:48.229
Little hee-ha-hos.

04:48.403 --> 04:49.495
- God, that's nice.
- Ew.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.710
Let me see your phone.
I can use one for each glute.

04:51.839 --> 04:53.273
That's just gross.

04:53.441 --> 04:55.273
Bring this puppy up to a little Shiatsu.

04:55.443 --> 04:57.002
Morse code? Really?

04:57.178 --> 04:58.612
- Keeping it fresh.
- Uh-huh.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.270
What's next, smoke signals?

05:01.983 --> 05:03.712
- Don't.
- What do we have?

05:04.218 --> 05:06.949
Ahem. A, uh, robbery and a shooting
early this morning

05:07.121 --> 05:09.419
at a Department of Energy
research facility.

05:09.891 --> 05:10.915
The security guard

05:11.092 --> 05:14.528
is retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Dennis Martin.

05:14.695 --> 05:17.562
He is currently in surgery at UCLA.

05:18.499 --> 05:21.059
The guard got off two shots,
center mass.

05:21.235 --> 05:23.727
Didn't know the shooter
was wearing a vest.

05:24.005 --> 05:27.635
- What'd they steal?
- The United States MINDS locations.

05:27.809 --> 05:30.676
- As in governmental mind-control?
- As in MINDS.

05:30.845 --> 05:33.371
Miniature Integrated
Nuclear Detection System.

05:33.548 --> 05:34.947
It's an antiterrorism device

05:35.116 --> 05:37.608
that can locate and detect
sources of radiation

05:37.785 --> 05:39.719
that could be used
in a nuclear bomb.

05:39.887 --> 05:41.582
What makes it a deterrent
for bad guys

05:41.756 --> 05:44.487
is that it's unobtrusive
and can be anywhere.

05:44.659 --> 05:48.152
Building lobbies, train stations,
entry gates across the country.

05:48.329 --> 05:51.299
If terrorists know where sensors are,
they can transport a nuclear device

05:51.466 --> 05:52.729
through a U.S. city undetected.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.299
Incoming.

05:54.569 --> 05:59.234
Miss Jones, send a copy of the case
information to my desk immediately.

05:59.507 --> 06:00.565
Copy that.

06:00.741 --> 06:02.607
Well, this isn't weird at all.

06:03.911 --> 06:06.346
I heard that, Mr. Deeks.

06:10.451 --> 06:12.351
I'm pretty sure that look
just pierced my soul.

06:12.653 --> 06:14.013
What do we know
about the dead guy?

06:14.155 --> 06:15.247
Brody Stallworth.

06:15.423 --> 06:17.790
Long list of high-profile
home robberies.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.559
He's bypassed most of the latest
state-of-the-art security systems

06:20.728 --> 06:22.208
that the private sector has to offer.

06:22.363 --> 06:24.991
- And the other guy?
- No ID on the motorcyclist.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.999
So we have a master thief
and then we have the other guy.

06:28.736 --> 06:32.536
I'm just saying, for partners, it's clearly
an imbalance of perceived value.

06:32.707 --> 06:34.300
Running low on self-esteem,
are we?

06:34.475 --> 06:36.034
Maybe.

06:36.210 --> 06:38.702
The other guy got away
on his motorcycle.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.370
Looks like he took a bullet.

06:40.548 --> 06:42.676
And he's probably looking
for medical attention.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.909
- Right.
- I'll check the hospitals.

06:45.086 --> 06:47.919
And Stallworth's last known address
was in North Hollywood.

06:48.089 --> 06:50.183
I've just downloaded it
to your smartphones.

06:50.358 --> 06:52.078
Sam and I will check out
Stallworth's place.

06:52.159 --> 06:55.079
Kensi, why don't you and the other guy
check out the Department of Energy,

06:55.229 --> 06:57.095
- see what you can find.
- Of course.

06:57.265 --> 07:00.701
The other guy, that's great. Just take
the rest of my soul, why don't you?

07:04.705 --> 07:06.639
Federal agents!

07:22.623 --> 07:23.818
Clear.

07:26.594 --> 07:28.392
Clear. G, down here!

07:34.902 --> 07:36.370
You having a little tool envy?

07:36.537 --> 07:40.371
Ha, ha. Hardly.
But this is impressive.

07:40.975 --> 07:43.672
These guys definitely knew
what they were doing.

07:45.413 --> 07:47.939
They were building custom tools
for their jobs.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.013
Looks like they were using the cover
of an HVAC company

07:52.186 --> 07:53.676
to get the layout of their targets.

07:56.757 --> 07:59.522
- I know that look.
- It just doesn't make sense.

08:00.328 --> 08:02.558
I understand these guys were skilled
at what they do.

08:02.730 --> 08:03.754
The right tools help.

08:04.632 --> 08:06.259
But they're glorified cat burglars.

08:06.434 --> 08:08.402
It's a blue-collar operation,
it's hands-on.

08:08.569 --> 08:10.367
But think about it,
the Department of Energy?

08:11.072 --> 08:12.938
It's way above their pay grade.

08:13.107 --> 08:15.542
That is not your typical B and E.

08:26.921 --> 08:28.719
Looks like he splurged for parking.

08:29.023 --> 08:30.650
Let's check it out.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.390
You care to take a guess?

08:37.365 --> 08:39.993
- That one.
- Good guess.

08:48.209 --> 08:49.836
Guess he came home to die.

09:03.823 --> 09:06.190
In the video,
he was shot only once in the shoulder.

09:08.728 --> 09:11.754
He has three close-range wounds
to the torso.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.299
Look at the blood spatter.

09:16.202 --> 09:18.000
He tracked him back to finish the job.

09:18.171 --> 09:22.233
Or our shooter knew
he was coming back here.

09:23.476 --> 09:25.706
Tied up loose ends.

09:30.817 --> 09:32.046
G.

09:33.286 --> 09:35.015
Say "cheese."

09:35.188 --> 09:36.678
Might have gotten a shot of our guy.

09:37.757 --> 09:39.919
I'll get the Wonder Twins on it.

09:41.227 --> 09:42.947
They came in
through the ventilation system.

09:43.096 --> 09:45.929
They navigated the ductwork and
dropped down in front of this station.

09:46.099 --> 09:48.431
- How many systems on this floor?
- Uh, maybe 40.

09:48.601 --> 09:51.002
So they break in, they know exactly
which station to hack?

09:51.170 --> 09:52.331
The system wasn't hacked.

09:52.505 --> 09:53.870
It was accessed normally.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.872
That's why no security was tripped.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.976
Every station needs
a personal passkey

09:58.144 --> 09:59.771
to log on to their specific system.

09:59.946 --> 10:03.041
- Whose station is this?
- Uh, Roy Kessler's.

10:03.216 --> 10:05.150
But Roy is a great guy.

10:05.318 --> 10:07.787
Let me guess, great guy
that buys margaritas on Fridays?

10:08.621 --> 10:10.180
And then didn't show up for work
today.

10:12.158 --> 10:13.216
As a matter of fact.

10:13.693 --> 10:14.854
I'm gonna need his address.

10:15.028 --> 10:16.462
I'm gonna call it in.

10:16.629 --> 10:19.349
Roy Kessler has a flight booked
out of Burbank, but you better hurry.

10:19.499 --> 10:21.900
He's hired a car service
to pick him up in 20 minutes.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.503
Okay, Roy,
let's see what you got in here.

10:25.505 --> 10:27.371
Two pair of slacks.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.474
T-shirt.

10:30.243 --> 10:31.608
Birth certificate.

10:31.778 --> 10:34.076
You're taking a trip to New York
and this is all you pack?

10:35.114 --> 10:37.242
Are you in a rush?
I don't know about you,

10:37.417 --> 10:39.215
but I over-pack
when I go to the valley.

10:39.385 --> 10:41.410
Maybe he was gonna shop
when he got there.

10:41.754 --> 10:42.778
I can explain.

10:42.956 --> 10:45.156
We know your passkey was used
in the robbery last night.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.625
Why were you running?

10:49.495 --> 10:50.826
I know how this looks.

10:50.997 --> 10:52.897
I don't think you do.

10:55.068 --> 10:59.665
Okay, look, I was partying
with these two girls last night.

10:59.839 --> 11:00.897
Way out of my league.

11:01.074 --> 11:04.772
So I'm thinking working girls, right?
But at this point, I could care less.

11:05.511 --> 11:07.411
Things got a little crazy.

11:07.580 --> 11:10.845
The next thing I remember,
I'm waking up at home, alone.

11:11.017 --> 11:12.849
I must have been drugged.

11:15.989 --> 11:18.151
Nothing like a good old-fashioned
honeypot.

11:18.825 --> 11:21.226
It wasn't until I heard
about the robbery on the news

11:21.394 --> 11:23.192
that I noticed
that my passkey was missing.

11:23.363 --> 11:25.331
So rather than help
with the investigation,

11:25.498 --> 11:26.863
you decided to skip town.

11:28.201 --> 11:31.831
I logged on to the system
to see what the thieves accessed.

11:32.071 --> 11:34.472
- I guess I panicked.
- Why?

11:35.041 --> 11:38.375
Because they only copied part
of the MINDS databases.

11:38.544 --> 11:41.878
- Which part?
- Los Angeles County.

11:43.116 --> 11:45.448
We're all in danger.

11:46.486 --> 11:48.250
Okay, so where do we even start?

11:48.421 --> 11:50.913
Pinpointing a target's
gonna be damn near impossible.

11:51.090 --> 11:54.151
L.A. County is 4752 square miles.

11:54.327 --> 11:56.295
Got a nuke in a haystack.

11:56.462 --> 11:58.430
There's no way we can evacuate
a whole county.

11:58.598 --> 12:00.532
Whoever stole this
is looking to make some coin,

12:00.700 --> 12:03.397
or this is a terrorist attack
in its final stage.

12:03.569 --> 12:06.800
Well, the security camera
from Stallworth's garage paid off.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.210
Our shooter entered the alley
wearing a ski mask.

12:10.376 --> 12:12.003
I'm sorry, how is that a payoff?

12:12.178 --> 12:15.113
We figured someone walking around
in a ski mask would draw attention,

12:15.281 --> 12:16.510
so we scanned the area,

12:16.682 --> 12:19.879
and we found him using a pay phone
two blocks away.

12:20.053 --> 12:23.182
Same clothes, same build,
no ski mask.

12:23.356 --> 12:25.984
Okay, honestly,
who still uses a pay phone?

12:26.159 --> 12:28.821
I'd rather kiss the Outbreak monkey
than use a pay phone.

12:29.162 --> 12:31.688
How are you a germaphobe?
I've seen your apartment.

12:31.864 --> 12:33.263
Okay, I'm fine with my own germs.

12:33.433 --> 12:35.765
You of all people should not be giving
housekeeping notes.

12:35.935 --> 12:37.266
I've seen cleaner litter boxes.

12:37.437 --> 12:38.598
Oh, meow.

12:40.239 --> 12:42.936
- We got an ID?
- No. Nothing through facial rec yet.

12:43.109 --> 12:46.272
I'll see if the boys in blue can pull
a print off that coin-operated petri dish.

12:46.446 --> 12:48.005
Remember that gum I gave you?

12:48.181 --> 12:50.741
- Dropped it on the bathroom floor first.
- That's not funny.

12:51.150 --> 12:54.711
Guys, Gunnery Sergeant Martin,
the DOE security guard,

12:54.887 --> 12:57.049
he just got out of surgery.
He's conscious.

12:59.058 --> 13:03.291
Two tours in the Middle East,
and I get shot at home.

13:03.596 --> 13:06.964
And working as a security guard,
no less.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.191
You're lucky to be alive.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.028
I'm not so sure about that.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.905
Bullet nicked my spine.

13:13.406 --> 13:15.374
Doc's not sure
I'm gonna walk again.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.066
Then you prove them wrong.

13:17.243 --> 13:19.940
You're a Marine. That's what you do.

13:21.581 --> 13:23.447
Oorah to that.

13:26.552 --> 13:29.351
Is there anything else you can tell us
about what happened?

13:33.092 --> 13:35.925
- Hand me the phone.
- You got something?

13:37.897 --> 13:40.332
I saw the shooter drive away.

13:41.567 --> 13:44.400
Tried to snap a shot
before I blacked out.

13:45.037 --> 13:46.596
This is a great lead.

13:49.408 --> 13:50.671
Call it Marine training.

13:52.411 --> 13:54.072
Qorah, indeed.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.154
I heard you pulled the Griffin file.

14:12.098 --> 14:14.032
Is that why you're here?

14:14.867 --> 14:17.461
Well, that and the small matter
of a possible nuclear bomb

14:17.637 --> 14:19.366
threatening L.A. County.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.803
You think Griffin's behind it?

14:25.077 --> 14:28.172
- I hope not.
- It makes sense.

14:28.714 --> 14:30.944
We suspected Griffin's team
of selling secrets

14:31.117 --> 14:34.382
when they initiated the nuclear
detection program years ago.

14:34.554 --> 14:36.750
Yes, but we couldn't prove anything.

14:36.923 --> 14:38.652
Doesn't mean he wasn't guilty.

14:39.992 --> 14:42.552
Your investigation cost him
his career.

14:43.229 --> 14:46.199
His destructive lifestyle
cost him his career.

14:46.365 --> 14:48.060
Of course.

14:49.602 --> 14:52.037
You still blame me for letting him go.

14:52.205 --> 14:54.264
Whether I do or don't is irrelevant.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.239
What matters is,
if Griffin's behind a nuclear attack,

14:57.410 --> 15:00.209
everyone from the SECNAV
to the commander in chief

15:00.379 --> 15:02.780
most certainly will blame you.

15:03.149 --> 15:07.108
And that, Henrietta,
will be the end of your career.

15:18.563 --> 15:20.657
- What have you got?
- You may wanna send.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.164
Gunnery Sergeant Martin
an Edible Arrangement.

15:23.335 --> 15:24.812
Footage from his mobile device
came through.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.065
I love those things.

15:26.238 --> 15:28.502
I get the kiwis
in the shape of the animals,

15:28.673 --> 15:31.404
and I pretend I'm a lion, and I'm like:

15:32.677 --> 15:35.544
- You realize you're talking out loud?
- Yeah.

15:36.047 --> 15:37.071
Okay.

15:37.382 --> 15:39.783
Uh, Kaleidoscope got a hit
on the shooter's plates.

15:39.951 --> 15:41.350
- Where?
- It's gone now,

15:41.519 --> 15:44.181
but an hour ago, the car was parked
at a warehouse in Echo Park.

15:44.356 --> 15:47.587
- Callen and Sam are already en route.
- Tell them we're on the way.

15:58.837 --> 16:01.101
Kensi and Deeks are on their way.

16:08.647 --> 16:09.944
It's locked. I got it.

16:37.108 --> 16:38.269
Clear.

16:39.511 --> 16:40.979
Clear.

16:48.753 --> 16:51.814
Well, I knew skipping
that hieroglyphics class

16:51.990 --> 16:54.118
was gonna come back to bite me.

16:56.494 --> 16:58.360
What do you think the pins
represent?

17:00.065 --> 17:02.625
There's too many
to be MINDS locations.

17:03.568 --> 17:06.195
Has to be a key around here
somewhere to decipher it.

17:07.672 --> 17:10.368
Whoa!
Whoa, man. We're on your side.

17:11.509 --> 17:13.807
I told you to send them an alert
when we were coming in.

17:13.978 --> 17:15.002
I did.

17:15.180 --> 17:16.204
Oh, there it is.

17:16.381 --> 17:19.316
It's not my fault we move faster
than the speed of cellular.

17:20.518 --> 17:21.952
I got something here.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.383
What is it?

17:23.922 --> 17:26.686
It's routing information for cobalt-60.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.257
That's a medical-grade isotope.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.187
Medical-grade? That means we're not
talking about a nuclear explosion.

17:31.329 --> 17:34.026
No, cobalt-60 is something you'd use
to make a dirty bomb.

17:34.566 --> 17:35.926
The blast waves from the explosion

17:36.067 --> 17:38.195
would be more lethal
than a radioactive explosion.

17:38.370 --> 17:39.599
He's trying to scare them.

17:39.771 --> 17:41.569
This is all about psychological harm.

17:42.807 --> 17:44.070
Think about it.

17:44.242 --> 17:46.233
Mass panic,

17:46.411 --> 17:49.005
economic damage, terror.

17:49.180 --> 17:50.773
This isn't a weapon
of mass destruction.

17:50.949 --> 17:52.917
It's a weapon of mass disruption.

17:54.352 --> 17:57.652
So these markers
could all be cobalt-60 locations.

17:57.822 --> 18:00.484
Yeah, but there's no way to tell
what these locations are.

18:00.658 --> 18:02.818
Kensi, you and Deeks focus
on this routing information,

18:02.961 --> 18:05.396
see if you can pinpoint
where this cobalt-60 came from.

18:05.563 --> 18:06.792
On it.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.966
It's useless.

18:12.137 --> 18:15.903
If this guy was able to secure materials
to make a dirty bomb,

18:16.074 --> 18:17.599
we may already be out of time.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.407
You wanted to see me?

18:28.253 --> 18:29.618
How we doing?

18:30.321 --> 18:33.814
Well, nobody in the warehouse,
but lots of intel.

18:33.992 --> 18:35.619
We're trying to decipher it
as we speak.

18:35.794 --> 18:37.785
I'm about to go on-site
to get a firsthand look.

18:38.263 --> 18:39.890
Send Mr. Beale.

18:40.899 --> 18:41.923
Okay.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.392
I need to know where this man is.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.506
"Kelvin C. Griffin."

18:48.673 --> 18:50.402
Is he involved in the case?

18:50.575 --> 18:52.600
I hope not.

18:53.711 --> 18:56.305
This is priority one.

18:56.481 --> 18:58.540
Drop everything. Find him.

18:59.584 --> 19:01.416
I'll get right on it.

19:02.287 --> 19:03.652
Nell?

19:04.489 --> 19:06.321
For my eyes only.

19:06.624 --> 19:08.183
Of course.

19:16.501 --> 19:18.299
We're missing something.

19:18.470 --> 19:21.098
Ugh. It's impossible without the legend.

19:21.272 --> 19:23.104
I'm good, but I'm hardly a legend.

19:23.908 --> 19:25.467
Where's Nell?

19:25.710 --> 19:28.941
I think the question is, "Eric,
how did you get an ID on the shooter?"

19:30.048 --> 19:35.282
Answer: I was granted access
to the CIA database.

19:35.453 --> 19:38.184
In exchange for favors
to be called in later. Don't ask.

19:41.292 --> 19:42.953
Really?

19:45.830 --> 19:48.458
Just a picture password.

19:50.969 --> 19:54.735
Ferat Hadad.
He's a member of As-Sai'qa.

19:55.306 --> 19:57.138
Syrian special forces.

19:57.475 --> 19:58.704
The CIA isn't talking,

19:58.877 --> 20:01.608
but you get the impression
that they want him real bad.

20:01.779 --> 20:03.474
So a Syrian commando

20:03.648 --> 20:07.141
has in his possession
U.S. MINDS locations.

20:08.286 --> 20:09.947
What's his next move?

20:10.121 --> 20:12.852
We may never know
if we have to decipher all this first.

20:13.024 --> 20:15.686
Well, allow me.

20:18.630 --> 20:19.688
Yeah.

20:19.864 --> 20:21.855
Okay, interesting.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.762
Very interesting.

20:24.669 --> 20:26.501
- What does it mean?
- Not a clue.

20:28.306 --> 20:30.673
Oh, I'm patched in
to the DOE security system.

20:31.175 --> 20:32.506
They just got a MINDS alert.

20:32.677 --> 20:35.578
- Where?
- Uh, Grand Park. Downtown.

20:37.181 --> 20:38.205
Hold on a second.

20:38.716 --> 20:41.310
What are we doing with him?
We can't leave him here alone.

20:41.986 --> 20:43.750
He's not.

20:45.123 --> 20:46.557
I'm the backup.

20:48.393 --> 20:49.485
Should we ask?

20:49.661 --> 20:52.153
No. You should go, quickly.

20:56.534 --> 20:57.865
Hi.

21:04.609 --> 21:05.729
Well, it looks pretty quiet.

21:05.877 --> 21:08.847
I don't even see the dude selling death
by hot-dog-wrapped-in-bacon.

21:09.013 --> 21:10.071
Possible false alarm?

21:10.248 --> 21:12.546
No, something set off that alarm.

21:13.017 --> 21:15.247
This just doesn't feel right.

21:15.587 --> 21:18.887
Whoever stole that tech
had to know we'd be on alert.

21:19.057 --> 21:20.320
This could be a setup.

21:20.491 --> 21:23.222
If there's the slightest chance it's legit,
we gotta check it out.

21:23.394 --> 21:24.759
Right.

21:24.929 --> 21:27.296
- Split up, sweep the area.
- Look for anything abandoned.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.465
Check the trash cans,
search for anything deserted.

21:29.634 --> 21:30.726
Got it.

21:56.494 --> 21:58.622
Could be on someone's person.

21:58.796 --> 22:00.958
You mean like a bomb vest?

22:02.033 --> 22:04.434
There. Guy in the beige jacket.

22:12.276 --> 22:15.439
- It's Hadad.
- He's looking for somebody.

22:17.315 --> 22:18.646
He's on the move.

22:18.816 --> 22:20.784
I'll take the right flank.

22:29.794 --> 22:31.319
Stop! Federal agents!

22:32.397 --> 22:34.627
- Aah!
- It's over.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.829
Let her go.

22:37.201 --> 22:39.260
Drop your weapon. Now.

22:39.437 --> 22:40.700
Don't do it.

22:41.472 --> 22:42.667
Do not do it.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.537
Hadad!

22:45.309 --> 22:47.175
Aah!

22:49.347 --> 22:50.974
What was that?

22:51.282 --> 22:52.841
Come with me.

22:54.686 --> 22:56.620
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

22:56.788 --> 22:58.381
We're federal agents. You're safe.

22:58.556 --> 23:00.285
Oh, my God.

23:03.695 --> 23:04.958
No bomb.

23:24.481 --> 23:26.040
Callen.

23:26.316 --> 23:29.377
I don't suppose it occurred to you
to try and take him alive.

23:30.253 --> 23:31.448
He had a hostage.

23:33.056 --> 23:35.957
- Where's Hetty?
- With Beale.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.226
Why? What's going on?

23:39.395 --> 23:40.885
Nothing you wanna know about.

23:44.134 --> 23:45.693
Check it out.

23:47.137 --> 23:50.004
"West doors, 2:00, gray suit.”

23:50.673 --> 23:52.033
A meeting or he was following him?

23:52.175 --> 23:54.041
Guy like Hadad?

23:54.377 --> 23:56.004
He was here to take him out.

23:57.614 --> 24:01.141
Maybe Nell can tell us who he is.

24:01.451 --> 24:04.421
Hadad's not wearing a bomb vest,
so, what set off the MINDS alert?

24:05.421 --> 24:06.786
Excuse me.

24:06.956 --> 24:08.321
- Can I borrow this?
- Sure.

24:08.491 --> 24:09.617
Thank you.

24:09.959 --> 24:11.825
Excuse me, guys.

24:23.940 --> 24:27.103
It's weak, but it's positive.

24:28.011 --> 24:30.412
- Did you find something?
- Cobalt-60.

24:30.580 --> 24:32.878
- The guy's clothes are covered in it.
- Uh...

24:33.049 --> 24:37.145
Relax. It's less than
what we're exposed to on a daily basis,

24:37.320 --> 24:39.186
but it was enough
to set the sensors off.

24:39.355 --> 24:40.584
We should still take a shower.

24:40.757 --> 24:44.921
I got a positive ID on our magazine guy.
The guy's name is Richard Towson.

24:45.094 --> 24:47.358
He's a businessman
in East Cleveland, Ohio.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.459
Ohio?
What's he doing in Los Angeles?

24:49.632 --> 24:51.361
He's not.

24:51.701 --> 24:53.135
He's still in Ohio.

24:53.303 --> 24:55.795
Hadad was targeting a man
2,000 miles away.

24:55.972 --> 24:56.996
It makes no sense.

24:57.173 --> 24:59.471
It might if Hadad was set up
to trigger the sensors.

24:59.642 --> 25:01.804
They're gauging our protocol.

25:02.078 --> 25:05.309
Wide-open space,
possibility of large groups of people.

25:05.882 --> 25:10.513
Response times, agencies,
device sensitivity.

25:10.887 --> 25:12.048
It's a test.

25:12.222 --> 25:15.487
Well, so if he's willing to sacrifice
radioactive material on a test...

25:15.658 --> 25:18.059
It stands to reason he has more
to make an actual dirty bomb.

25:18.228 --> 25:19.718
Right.

25:20.597 --> 25:22.156
Wonderful.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.232
Damn, it makes no sense.

25:28.404 --> 25:30.873
Every time I think I'm close,
the pattern changes.

25:31.140 --> 25:32.835
There are just too many pins.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.205
Persistence, Mr. Beale.

25:35.545 --> 25:38.412
I've tried every code-cracking formula
known to man.

25:38.581 --> 25:42.279
Maybe it's time to try those
known to women.

25:44.621 --> 25:48.888
Are you suggesting that Nell is better
at these sort of things?

25:50.493 --> 25:51.688
Is she?

26:01.771 --> 26:03.933
Can I ask you a question, Hetty?

26:04.941 --> 26:08.935
I'd probably prefer you focus
on the task at hand.

26:11.781 --> 26:13.215
Why are you here?

26:13.383 --> 26:15.044
What's going on?

26:20.290 --> 26:22.122
Is everything okay?

26:25.428 --> 26:28.227
It's, uh, possible

26:28.398 --> 26:31.857
that the man who's behind this

26:32.035 --> 26:37.974
is someone who once slipped
through my fingers.

26:41.110 --> 26:42.475
That sucks.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.978
Indeed.

26:55.358 --> 26:58.953
Hmm. This looks promising.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.258
You sneaky son of a cipher.

27:09.038 --> 27:11.200
What are we looking at?

27:12.241 --> 27:15.302
It's a map of the entire West Coast.

27:15.478 --> 27:16.946
Let's see what this one does.

27:17.513 --> 27:18.537
It's color-coded.

27:18.715 --> 27:20.774
Yellow flags go
with the yellow border.

27:21.050 --> 27:23.610
And this one.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.783
My best guess is,
these pins represent vulnerable targets

27:27.957 --> 27:30.517
from San Diego
all the way up to Seattle.

27:32.895 --> 27:34.488
And the red flags?

27:34.664 --> 27:36.996
They go with the red border.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.392
The flags must represent his targets.

27:40.803 --> 27:45.969
Which, in this case, is a one-mile
radius of downtown Los Angeles.

27:47.910 --> 27:49.935
We're coordinating with FBI, L.A.P.D.

27:50.113 --> 27:51.512
and the NEST teams, Mr. Secretary.

27:51.681 --> 27:53.581
We're closing in on them.

27:54.217 --> 27:56.481
The moment we do, sir.

27:56.652 --> 27:57.881
Tell me we got something.

27:58.054 --> 28:01.388
One-mile radius around downtown still
leaves hundreds of potential targets.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.037
We're no closer to finding the target

28:03.192 --> 28:05.160
than we are to finding the guy
who set up Hadad.

28:05.561 --> 28:07.029
Doesn't add up.

28:07.196 --> 28:09.392
This could've been the attack.
Why wait?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.632
Could be a diversion.

28:12.802 --> 28:15.430
So, what else in the area
should we be looking at?

28:16.739 --> 28:21.142
It's not what we're looking at,
it's what's looking at us.

28:21.310 --> 28:22.835
Think about it.

28:23.012 --> 28:26.607
If this is your test,
how do you know if you're successful?

28:27.049 --> 28:30.110
All right, fan out.
We're looking for an outlier.

28:38.661 --> 28:39.685
Sounds like a voyeur.

28:39.862 --> 28:42.331
They observe from a distance,
telephoto lens, two-way mirrors.

28:42.498 --> 28:43.618
Something you wanna tell me?

28:43.766 --> 28:46.235
Just ignore the garden gnome
outside your bedroom window.

28:46.402 --> 28:48.268
Now, can we get a bird's-eye view
of the teams?

28:48.438 --> 28:50.907
We're thinking our guy
might be hiding in plain sight.

28:51.073 --> 28:55.237
Okay, I've got eyes on the area
from multiple feeds.

28:55.411 --> 28:57.209
Let's see.

28:57.914 --> 29:02.374
Southeast corner of Hill Street,
there's a man in a NEST windbreaker.

29:02.552 --> 29:04.432
He's standing just outside
the police perimeter.

29:05.054 --> 29:07.921
- Nell, we don't see him.
- Got him.

29:13.596 --> 29:14.961
Oh, boy.

29:15.131 --> 29:17.566
- What is it, Nell?
- Uh, it's nothing.

29:18.835 --> 29:21.065
Uh, he is heading down
into the metro station.

29:21.237 --> 29:24.002
Kensi, Deeks, move to the west
entrance. We'll flush him to you.

29:24.173 --> 29:25.766
Remember to take him alive.

29:48.598 --> 29:50.259
Move! Out of the way!

29:50.433 --> 29:52.595
- Excuse me!
- Hey.

30:02.345 --> 30:03.904
Excuse me.

30:08.551 --> 30:10.645
Move! Move!

30:12.288 --> 30:13.312
We got him.

30:13.489 --> 30:15.719
- Federal agents! Stop!
- Damn it.

30:45.555 --> 30:47.990
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:53.029 --> 30:55.623
This is why I hate
taking the subway.

31:20.722 --> 31:22.486
Remember me?

31:24.359 --> 31:25.724
Yeah.

31:25.960 --> 31:29.191
You're the stump that ruined my life.

31:32.066 --> 31:34.831
- Hetty knows this guy?
- She let him go once.

31:35.303 --> 31:38.329
Something tells me she's not
gonna make that mistake again.

31:42.911 --> 31:45.175
You swore you were innocent.

31:45.914 --> 31:48.281
You swore to me.

31:48.583 --> 31:51.746
And yet here we are again.

31:56.491 --> 32:01.088
You helped develop
the, uh, detection program

32:01.262 --> 32:02.696
to defend the country.

32:04.566 --> 32:08.525
To protect people

32:09.204 --> 32:11.002
like your own children.

32:11.873 --> 32:14.069
You were a patriot.

32:15.243 --> 32:17.940
Somewhere, you lost your way.

32:20.548 --> 32:24.451
It happens to all of us

32:24.752 --> 32:26.686
at some point.

32:29.624 --> 32:32.491
This won't make up
for what you've done,

32:32.660 --> 32:34.594
but it's a step.

32:35.029 --> 32:39.057
And you can still save lives.

32:48.810 --> 32:50.835
What is the target?

33:03.458 --> 33:05.119
I don't know.

33:07.095 --> 33:08.893
I don't think you understand.

33:14.903 --> 33:17.531
It's over.

33:21.643 --> 33:24.704
I was just running scenarios,

33:24.879 --> 33:27.075
collecting data.

33:29.450 --> 33:31.612
I needed the money.

33:34.389 --> 33:35.879
I don't know their target.

33:36.190 --> 33:37.783
- Their?
- Yeah.

33:37.959 --> 33:39.256
There's a house in Hancock Park

33:39.427 --> 33:42.226
and it belongs
to the Russian Consulate.

33:43.431 --> 33:46.890
The data, it's encrypted,

33:47.068 --> 33:49.059
but it won't take them that long.

33:49.704 --> 33:55.040
You sold our nuclear detection
technology to the Russians?

33:55.343 --> 33:57.937
Just when you thought
the Cold War was over.

33:58.112 --> 34:00.274
Not even close.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.688
So, what are we gonna do now?

34:09.157 --> 34:11.216
Be happy your career's not over.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.994
This is not Hetty's fault.

34:16.164 --> 34:17.324
Doesn't matter.

34:17.498 --> 34:22.458
In this game, Agent Blye,
somebody always takes the blame.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.014
There's gotta be something
we can do.

34:43.391 --> 34:45.324
This is an Oval Office nightmare
now.

34:46.995 --> 34:50.454
What do the Russians want
with L.A.'s nuclear detection system?

34:51.866 --> 34:54.130
The Cold War's heating up.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.464
Friend or foe,
nations collect intel on each other.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.469
Never know when they'll need
or use it.

34:58.639 --> 34:59.765
Or share it.

34:59.941 --> 35:01.909
Hey, guys.
The house Griffin identified

35:02.076 --> 35:04.101
does indeed belong
to the Russian Consulate,

35:04.278 --> 35:06.770
which means
it's considered foreign soil.

35:07.448 --> 35:11.043
So we can't just bang on the door
and tell them to hand it over?

35:11.219 --> 35:13.620
Not without causing
an international incident.

35:13.788 --> 35:16.348
It's only an international incident
if you get caught.

35:16.524 --> 35:20.051
Whoa, no, spoiler alert.
I do not wanna hear this.

35:20.228 --> 35:22.060
Cover your ears.

35:23.131 --> 35:24.621
We're all in this together, Beale.

35:24.799 --> 35:26.858
Think about this, G.

35:27.201 --> 35:29.533
Breaking into a foreign consulate,

35:29.704 --> 35:32.332
an action which, if we're caught,

35:32.507 --> 35:34.532
forces our government
to disavow us.

35:35.977 --> 35:37.911
I understand
if you don't wanna be involved.

35:38.079 --> 35:39.945
What are you talking about? I'm in.

35:40.114 --> 35:42.481
- I'm talking about them.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:42.650 --> 35:45.312
We don't do this, we lose Hetty.
We are in.

35:45.486 --> 35:46.578
Yeah, it's Hetty.

35:46.754 --> 35:49.416
Besides, if Kensi goes, I go.

35:49.590 --> 35:50.648
That's how we roll.

35:50.825 --> 35:53.260
You realize we're off the reservation
with this one.

35:53.428 --> 35:55.522
We could all be subject
to criminal charges.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.357
Russia may even try
and extradite us.

35:57.532 --> 35:59.591
Never been to Russia.

36:00.001 --> 36:02.663
I hear the gulags are lovely
this time of year.

36:10.144 --> 36:12.306
Hello.
I'm with the South Hills Gas Company.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.073
- Yes?
- There's a been a quake.

36:14.248 --> 36:16.182
- Three-pointer.
- I didn't feel anything.

36:16.350 --> 36:18.580
Oh, yeah, that means
you're getting used to it.

36:18.753 --> 36:21.753
Personally, I don't get out of bed for
anything less than a six-banger. Heh.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.915
- Know what I'm saying?
- No, I don't.

36:25.093 --> 36:27.460
Anyhoo, we have a class-seven
gas main leak.

36:27.628 --> 36:29.619
We're evacuating people
as a safety precaution.

36:31.599 --> 36:32.623
We will not.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.461
Okay, Fern, I'm getting some serious

36:34.635 --> 36:36.755
class-five hydrogen readings,
so we should probably...

36:36.871 --> 36:39.397
What the hell, Fern?
What are these people still doing here?

36:39.574 --> 36:41.094
This thing could blow up
at any second.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.267
What do you wanna do?
He won't leave. Free country.

36:43.444 --> 36:45.242
They won't leave...
Where are you from, sir?

36:45.413 --> 36:46.903
Vladivostok.

36:47.081 --> 36:50.381
Vladivos... Okay, listen, I don't know
where that is, but here in America,

36:50.551 --> 36:52.918
we have a hydrogen pipe
running right underneath this house,

36:53.087 --> 36:56.250
and unless you wanna be inside of it
when it blows up I suggest you vacate.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.791
Okay, you know what?
If he blows up, this is on you.

36:58.960 --> 36:59.984
Have him sign a waiver.

37:00.161 --> 37:02.994
The city of Los Angeles is still
recovering from an earthquake

37:03.164 --> 37:05.963
- that struck the Hancock Park area...
- Give us a few moments.

37:08.970 --> 37:10.938
Guys, we got a power outage
in sector five.

37:11.539 --> 37:14.600
- Hold on.
- Copy that, sector five.

37:23.618 --> 37:24.676
Let's go, let's go.

37:30.391 --> 37:32.257
Is that everybody in the house, sir?

37:32.426 --> 37:33.723
How long this will take?

37:33.895 --> 37:35.624
Hopefully, not long.

37:38.166 --> 37:40.328
Phantom 1 and 2, you're a go.

38:03.791 --> 38:05.190
Bogey headed your way.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.360
I got him.

38:50.004 --> 38:52.439
They're moving the drives.
It's now or never.

39:01.182 --> 39:03.173
I'll draw him to me.

39:04.118 --> 39:07.213
- Make it quiet.
- Make it fast.

39:31.312 --> 39:32.711
So much for quiet.

39:35.049 --> 39:37.074
We've got some aftershock activity
going on here.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.219
Get those shuttles in
to clear these folks out.

40:03.077 --> 40:06.741
Uh, whoa. Sir, sorry, I can't let you
back in there until I have authorization.

40:09.550 --> 40:11.279
Get out of my way.

40:16.023 --> 40:17.491
That's your idea of quiet?

40:17.658 --> 40:18.955
Was that your idea of fast?

40:19.126 --> 40:22.187
- Hope you can fix that cabinet.
- No, that's gonna take a professional.

40:22.363 --> 40:24.422
Guys, time's up.
They're coming back in.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.806
You call for a shuttle?

40:45.286 --> 40:47.118
- We good?
- Not yet.

40:49.023 --> 40:50.320
Ride's here.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.183
Let's go.

40:56.630 --> 40:58.394
Well, go, go, go.

41:07.942 --> 41:10.172
L.A.P.D. reported a gunfight

41:10.344 --> 41:12.676
in the vicinity
of the Russian Consulate.

41:12.847 --> 41:14.127
I better not find out you had...

41:18.386 --> 41:19.683
God, no.

41:22.056 --> 41:23.217
Tell me you didn't.

41:24.892 --> 41:26.485
Didn't what?

41:29.130 --> 41:32.327
Plausible deniability won't save you.

41:35.836 --> 41:37.361
And you sanctioned this?

41:39.006 --> 41:41.600
I've been here with you, Owen.

41:42.710 --> 41:45.202
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

41:46.113 --> 41:47.603
Retrieved our technology?

41:47.915 --> 41:49.383
Made the world a better place?

41:49.550 --> 41:51.018
And looked good while doing it.

41:53.621 --> 41:56.556
This is gonna destroy our relationship
with the Russians.

41:56.724 --> 41:58.419
They can't make any accusations

41:58.592 --> 42:01.687
without admitting they stole it
in the first place.

42:05.065 --> 42:07.432
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

42:09.703 --> 42:11.193
No, sir.

42:14.041 --> 42:16.908
No, sir, that's not quite
how it went down.

42:17.711 --> 42:18.940
You good, Hetty?

42:19.113 --> 42:20.740
Just dandy.

42:22.616 --> 42:24.380
I understand.

42:27.121 --> 42:30.182
How many lives do you think
we've ruined doing what we do?

42:30.357 --> 42:31.950
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

42:32.126 --> 42:33.958
Not nearly as many as we've saved.

42:34.128 --> 42:37.758
Well, you dodged
the bullet on this one.

42:39.633 --> 42:42.796
But if any of you ever pull
something like this again...

42:48.108 --> 42:49.769
You all deserve each other.

42:55.783 --> 42:58.946
I certainly like to think so.

43:01.055 --> 43:03.285
Anyone for a vodka?
