We're taking
heavy artillery fire.

MAN [over radio]:
Ground support's

00:21.108 --> 00:24.067
Maintain compass heading,

00:24.111 --> 00:26.852
Roger that. Paley out.

WOMAN:
All right. Pull them up closer

00:30.465 --> 00:32.510

Gloria.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.425
Oops.Yeah. Like that.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.385
Oh, I can't get them full...
Yes, Mommy.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.734
[vehicles approaching]

00:38.777 --> 00:40.301
Got it.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.304
[dog barking in distance]

00:43.347 --> 00:46.002
Found a worm.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.270
Susan Paley?

00:54.315 --> 00:56.012
Yes?
Good morning.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.231
Hello.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.842
I'm Major Garrett.
This is Chaplain Licitra.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.279
Yes?

01:02.323 --> 01:05.500
We have a letter
from the Secretary of War.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.504
[crying]

01:22.865 --> 01:24.867
[phone ringing]

01:26.782 --> 01:30.351
I'm coming. Hold your horses.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.702
Hello.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.053
Yes? This is Gloria Paley.

01:46.497 --> 01:49.326
MAN:
Ma'am? Ma'am?

01:51.372 --> 01:53.287
RUSSELL:
Five days until midterms.

01:53.330 --> 01:57.029
That's 120 hours,
7,200 minutes, and counting.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.074
Look at you, with the math.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.554
I'm saying we're
up against it.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.686
If the president's bloc
doesn't take the House,

02:01.730 --> 02:03.688
you know what happens
to our legislative agenda?

02:03.732 --> 02:06.909
So how do I figure into
this doomsday scenario?

02:06.952 --> 02:09.433
Ever heard
of the David Paley Foundation?

02:10.391 --> 02:13.916
Yeah. Big advocates
for P.O.W.'s, right?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.178
Yeah. And M.I.A.'s.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.049
The foundation head,
Gloria Paley,

02:17.093 --> 02:19.791
held a presser in front of the
Capitol yesterday afternoon.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.619
All cued up.Thanks, Adele.

02:21.663 --> 02:24.056
You bet.
Madam Secretary.Good morning.

02:24.100 --> 02:27.538
73 years ago, a plane
my father, Captain David Paley,

02:27.582 --> 02:30.541
was piloting
went down in the Philippines.

02:30.585 --> 02:34.197
31 service members
were presumed dead.

02:34.241 --> 02:37.200
Three weeks ago,
I received word that the remains

02:37.244 --> 02:41.248
of those brave Americans
have finally been discovered.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.597
[applause]

02:42.640 --> 02:44.076
Since that hopeful day,

02:44.120 --> 02:47.906
the families of these patriots
have waited anxiously

02:47.950 --> 02:49.299
for their return.

02:49.343 --> 02:53.085
But our entreaties
have met with silence

02:53.129 --> 02:55.218
from the Dalton administration.[crowd booing]

02:55.262 --> 02:59.309
These men sacrificed everything
for their country.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.530
The government
must bring them home...

03:02.573 --> 03:04.271
[cheering, applause]

03:04.314 --> 03:06.316
...right now!

03:06.360 --> 03:08.362
[crowd cheering, whooping]

03:08.405 --> 03:10.886
CROWD [chanting]:
Right now! Right now! Right now!

03:10.929 --> 03:12.496
Right now.

03:12.540 --> 03:16.021
Three million hits
on YouTube in one day.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.849
Footage is already
being cut into attack ads

03:17.893 --> 03:20.243
against Dalton's allies
in swing districts.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.418
Getting those remains here

03:21.462 --> 03:23.986
should be an
administration priority

03:24.029 --> 03:25.292
regardless of optics.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.555
Which is where
you come in.

03:27.598 --> 03:31.733
Except repatriation falls
squarely in DoD's bailiwick.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.301
Fell.
Gordon stalled out.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.520
POTUS has asked
for your intervention.

03:36.564 --> 03:40.829
He feels your diplomatic
savoir faire might resolve this.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.310
My relationship
with Andrada is...

03:43.353 --> 03:45.312
a little fraught.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.488
Courtesy
of your pugilistic skill.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.838
Punching him for grabbing you.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.841
That's a muscular
foreign policy.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.408
That's your wallpaper?

03:54.451 --> 03:55.757
Yeah. I tried
to have it rendered

03:55.800 --> 03:57.889
in 3-D.I'm not amused.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.152
Well, neither
was Andrada.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.720
But fisticuffs
notwithstanding,

04:02.764 --> 04:04.635
the president believes
you're the one[phone buzzing]

04:04.679 --> 04:07.290
to get these soldiers
home, and I agree.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.292
Especially since
I assured him

04:09.336 --> 04:12.513
you're not gonna go
full Ronda Rousey this time.

04:12.556 --> 04:16.647
Which means you will
handle this at arm's length.

04:16.691 --> 04:19.128
But you will handle it.

04:19.171 --> 04:22.436
How did Gordon take it
when he learned that you were

04:22.479 --> 04:25.221
turning the matter
over to State?You'll have to tell me.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.181
Sure, Elizabeth,
you go get our war dead back.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.400
And then I'll go to Oslo

04:30.444 --> 04:32.097
and negotiate that treaty
on global warming.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.709
Gordon, this isn't a referendum
on your effectiveness.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.364
No. It's a referendum
on my ineffectiveness.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.366
The president simply believes

04:39.409 --> 04:42.499
State taking the lead on this
might expedite things.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.022
I haven't been sitting
on my hands.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.981
Those remains
would not even have been found

04:46.024 --> 04:48.549
were it not
for new infrared technology

04:48.592 --> 04:50.986
that we used
to scan the jungle canopy,

04:51.029 --> 04:55.164
technology I lobbied for.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.472
My dad died at Khe Sanh.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.517
This issue means a lot to me.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.782
So I can tell the president

05:04.826 --> 05:07.698
that I have the full
cooperation of DoD?

05:08.743 --> 05:10.179
[scoffs]

05:10.222 --> 05:13.225
Postmaster general
can run point on this.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.273
Long as it gets our people home.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.497
MAN: I share Secretary Becker's frustration.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.370
I've done everything
but storm MalacaÃ±ang Palace.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.851
I'm gonna need you to take
me through it, Martin.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.680
Andrada's staff
won't engage me on this issue.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.683
They claim it's beyond the
purview of an acting ambassador.

05:35.726 --> 05:36.858
That doesn't make sense.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.076
They know
you have plenary authority

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
to speak on behalf
of the administration.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.818
A fact I've repeatedly

05:40.862 --> 05:41.993
reminded them of.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.691
But they insist that our failure

05:43.734 --> 05:45.736
to appoint
a full-time ambassador

05:45.780 --> 05:47.303
is a slap in the face.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.046
But his office did send me this.

05:51.089 --> 05:55.398
A sampaguita.
The Philippine national flower.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.226
ELIZABETH:
Thanks, Martin.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.706
We'll take it from here.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.055
MARTIN:
Thank you, Madam Secretary.[computer beeps]

06:00.098 --> 06:02.144
I'm smelling pretext.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.146
Andrada's flexing.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.800
Using the remains to remind us

06:05.843 --> 06:08.455
that the Philippines
is our partner,

06:08.498 --> 06:10.152
not our subordinate.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.372
And the absence
of a full-time ambassador

06:12.415 --> 06:15.418
has given him an excuse
to squawk about respect.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.638
His administration
wants respect?

06:17.681 --> 06:20.641
Let's see how they feel
about dealing with me.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.034
I'll get Ambassador Carpio
in here.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.124
[indistinct chatter]

06:28.823 --> 06:31.173
Yes, Mrs. Lee.
Candidate Pavano feels

06:31.216 --> 06:33.044
that elder abuse
is an overlooked issue.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.830
He will make it a part of
the national conversation.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.093
WOMAN: All right, everybody,
look alive. Eyes up.Thank you for your vote.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.095
Let's focus.Hello, hello.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.532
Can I have everyone's attention
just for a second, please?

06:42.576 --> 06:44.795
I just want to thank you all
for your hard work.

06:44.839 --> 06:48.495
There is no campaign
without you, because change

06:48.538 --> 06:50.497
is a collective endeavor.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.021
Every single person matters.
Yeah?

06:53.064 --> 06:55.327
All right.

06:55.371 --> 06:58.156
Now, the next few days
will be decisive.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.811
Okay, we'll need
a social media onslaught.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.030
Door-to-door
for every undecided.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.684
And keep working
those call lists

07:03.727 --> 07:05.468
till the polls close.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.688
All right, let's make
a better world together.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.255
[all cheer]

07:10.299 --> 07:11.343
All right.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.781
ELIZABETH:
Respectfully,

07:13.824 --> 07:16.914
Ambassador Carpio,
15,000 Americans died

07:16.958 --> 07:19.874
defending the Philippines
against the Imperial Army.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.093
So expediting those remains
doesn't begin

07:22.137 --> 07:24.618
to cover the debt
your country owes.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.925
Madam Secretary...The only thing
that President Andrada has done

07:27.969 --> 07:31.059
since those bodies were found
is send flowers.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.017
JAY: Sampaguita,
which, as you know,

07:33.061 --> 07:34.802
means, "I promise you."

07:34.845 --> 07:37.674
So, what...

07:37.718 --> 07:40.372
what promise have we broken
that makes you think

07:40.416 --> 07:42.940
you can hold our war dead
for ransom?

07:44.507 --> 07:46.901
$300 million in
advanced weaponry,

07:46.944 --> 07:48.076
which we need to fight

07:48.119 --> 07:49.425
the Mindanao Freedom
Brigade insurgency.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.862
Islamic
Fundamentalists.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.429
We share your interest
in containing them.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.823
JAY: Which is why we've
been pushing H.R. 8365.

07:55.866 --> 07:56.824
Hard.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.260
But appropriations

07:58.303 --> 08:00.131
are the exclusive purview
of Congress.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.831
I understand, Madam Secretary.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.703
JAY: Then instead of
using our dead patriots

08:06.747 --> 08:08.749
to shake down the president,

08:08.792 --> 08:10.838
why aren't you mobilizing
your army of lobbyists?

08:12.883 --> 08:16.278
Because President Andrada

08:16.321 --> 08:18.585
doesn't want to make
a public stink

08:18.628 --> 08:20.978
about needing U.S. aid.

08:21.022 --> 08:23.241
Makes him look weak.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.245
You want those bodies,
get us that aid.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.684
Well, unfortunately,
it's not my purview

08:30.727 --> 08:32.337
to tell Congress what to do

08:32.381 --> 08:33.904
or when to do it.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.559
Your midterms are coming, right?

08:36.603 --> 08:39.040
What's that
Yankee expression?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.869
"Where there's a will,
there's a way."[taps desk]

08:45.655 --> 08:48.789
[gasps] Holy hell.
Stuffed French toast

08:48.832 --> 08:50.747
is back on the menu.I don't know what you
see in that. It's...

08:50.791 --> 08:52.923
Peanut butter.
Nutella. Cream cheese.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.186
I see God.I see an amateur.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.753
Oh, I'm getting
the Pynchon burger.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.799
Triple cheese,
bacon, avocado.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.236
Juice it with some onion
rings and jalapeÃ±os.

09:01.279 --> 09:04.021
Hey, Mitzi, think
we're ready to order.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.458
I'm afraid I can't serve
you guys today.

09:06.502 --> 09:07.982
Yeah, my wife hates
this tie, too.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.244
Dad. Oh, my God.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.202
I'm not kidding.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.901
Uh, what Mitzi's
trying to say is, uh,

09:13.944 --> 09:16.164
your family's not
welcome here anymore.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.168
[chuckles] Trevor,
what's going on?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.736
As a veteran, I'd expect
the Dalton administration

09:22.779 --> 09:24.520
to give a damn about
their war dead.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.218
But it doesn't. And your
wife is complicit in that.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.263
My wife?

09:28.306 --> 09:29.743
TREVOR:
Yeah, that's right.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.919
Trevor, we've been
coming here for years.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.616
I'm aware of that.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.226
You can't be serious.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.272
Dead serious.STEVIE:
My dad,

09:37.315 --> 09:38.708
he's a veteran, too.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.450
He's...He's willing to take
our business elsewhere.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.017
Come on, let's go.What?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.453
Let's go, Stevie. Come on.Dad...

09:48.500 --> 09:50.502
âª

09:59.990 --> 10:01.862
Ma'am.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.951
ELIZABETH:
Ms. Paley.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.735
Thank you for coming.

10:05.779 --> 10:09.913
I'm here out of respect
for you, Madam Secretary.

10:09.957 --> 10:13.221
Well, that respect
is shared.

10:13.264 --> 10:17.181
Please. What you and
your organization do

10:17.225 --> 10:19.488
to keep a spotlight

10:19.531 --> 10:22.752
on those who sacrificed
so much for our country...

10:22.796 --> 10:24.885
well, it's critically important.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.756
It is.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.934
I want you to know that my
team is working tirelessly

10:30.978 --> 10:33.676
to bring those
missing soldiers home.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.113
I'm glad to hear it.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.986
I fear...

10:39.029 --> 10:41.641
that our efforts
aren't being helped

10:41.684 --> 10:43.643
by your public statements.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.514
These are delicate
negotiations

10:45.557 --> 10:48.778
with an overreaching ally.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.259
I appreciate that,

10:51.302 --> 10:55.698
but more than 72,000 Americans

10:55.742 --> 10:58.353
who died in World War II

10:58.396 --> 11:01.661
still remain unaccounted for.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.794
72,000 families

11:04.838 --> 11:06.883
have never healed,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.320
and mine was one of them.

11:15.936 --> 11:19.330
The last time I saw my dad,

11:19.374 --> 11:22.072
he took me by the hand,

11:22.116 --> 11:24.814
he looked me in the eye

11:24.858 --> 11:26.860
and promised he
was coming home.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.561
I'm going to do
everything it takes

11:32.604 --> 11:35.216
to help him keep
that promise.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.829
DALTON:
So, how long do we have

11:39.873 --> 11:44.791
before Gloria Paley takes
to the airwaves again?

11:44.834 --> 11:48.925
She agreed to stand down until
the morning of the midterms.

11:48.969 --> 11:52.712
If the remains haven't left
Manila by then,

11:52.755 --> 11:55.236
she is going to hold
another press conference.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.980
Which will sink our allies
running for office.

12:00.023 --> 12:03.113
I don't blame the woman at all.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.203
Where are we on
those remains, Bess?

12:06.247 --> 12:10.730
Andrada's playing hardball until
we deliver his military aid.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.557
So who's holding up the bill?

12:12.601 --> 12:15.299
The new senator
from Kentucky, Owen Callister.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.562
He's the swing vote
on foreign relations

12:17.606 --> 12:20.000
who won't let the bill get
to the Senate floor.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.218
Elizabeth,
see if you can

12:21.262 --> 12:22.524
bring Callister to heel.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.048
If you can't, then tell Andrada

12:25.092 --> 12:27.181
we're slapping him
with sanctions.

12:27.224 --> 12:32.012
Oh, sir,
I would advise against that.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.057
He's gonna take it
as an affront.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.277
Says the woman
who shattered his nose.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.800
ELIZABETH:
Which is how I know

12:37.844 --> 12:39.584
that he is
particularly sensitive

12:39.628 --> 12:41.064
to an American display of power.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.807
Carrot or stick,
whatever it takes,

12:44.851 --> 12:46.853
because "no man left behind"
is not just a credo.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.855
It's a pledge we make
to the enlisted,

12:48.898 --> 12:50.465
and every second
those soldiers aren't back

12:50.508 --> 12:52.380
is a breach of faith
to those who serve.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.426
I'll lean on Senator Callister.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.953
Lean hard, Bess.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.871
[cheering, clapping]Where are you?

13:04.914 --> 13:08.439
No, get off the Beltway
and take the local streets.

13:08.483 --> 13:11.268
Just get here as quickly
as you can, okay? Bye.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.270
Thank you so much.Yeah, for sure.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.055
Nice turnout, Ali.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.752
Thanks for helping
organize it.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.449
You're welcome.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.452
Um, I'm afraid I messed up.

13:21.496 --> 13:25.065
I gave the sign language
interpreter the wrong address--

13:25.108 --> 13:26.849
Boulevard instead of Avenue.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.633
He's still 20 minutes out.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.331
I'm supposed to speak
on federal initiatives

13:30.374 --> 13:32.115
to increase educational access.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.075
It would be ironic if some
of the audience couldn't hear.I know.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.077
I'm so sorry.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.428
[sighs]

13:40.471 --> 13:42.256
It's not a problem, Ali.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.866
WOMAN:
Okay, everyone,

13:43.910 --> 13:46.695
please welcome Craig Pavano,
our candidate for Congress.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.610
[applause and cheering]

13:48.653 --> 13:50.220
Good morning.
Good morning, everyone.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.962
Good morning.
Thank you for coming out.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.791
[people gasping, murmuring]

13:55.835 --> 13:57.010
I'm Craig Pavano,

13:57.053 --> 13:58.576
and I'm running for Congress.WOMAN: Yes!

13:58.620 --> 13:59.926
[applause and cheering]

13:59.969 --> 14:02.580
I'm here to speak
about our children.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.973
[elevator bell dings]

14:04.017 --> 14:05.627
BLAKE:
Good morning,
Madam Secretary.

14:05.670 --> 14:10.110
You know, I have this fantasy
that one morning

14:10.153 --> 14:12.068
I'm going to step
off of that elevator

14:12.112 --> 14:14.418
and be greeted
by a genie.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.682
Or a masseuse,
or maybe a wayward puppy.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.249
Well, would you settle
for a stray Kat?

14:19.293 --> 14:20.250
[laughing]:
I would.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.382
I had to go there.
Hi.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.210
Welcome back.Thank you.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.560
How was the U.N.?It was good.
It was good.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.214
We made progress on
the refugee protocol.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.346
However, they do not care
about coffee over there.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.392
Philistines.Oh, it's so good to be home.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.828
[both laugh]

14:32.872 --> 14:35.570
Uh, Senator Callister
is prepped and waiting for us.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.224
Uh, and I... I did
some digging.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.226
It turns out his state houses
Paraverse Industries.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.054
They manufacture
much of the weaponry

14:41.097 --> 14:44.448
that we'd send Andrada's
way if H.R. 8365 passes.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.537
Ah.Yeah, Paraverse has
over 800 employees

14:46.581 --> 14:49.410
in Lexington alone,
meaning opposition to this bill

14:49.453 --> 14:51.412
takes food out
of his constituents' mouths.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.761
Nice work, everyone.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.416
Still holding out for a puppy.Yes, ma'am.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.418
Senator.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.810
So nice to meet you.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.203
Likewise, Madam Secretary.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.119
Kat.
Come on in.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.687
ELIZABETH:
This administration likes

15:05.730 --> 15:07.471
to work very closely
with Congress,

15:07.515 --> 15:11.127
which is why we called you in
to talk about H.R. 8365,

15:11.171 --> 15:12.650
which I understand you oppose?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.174
Yes, ma'am.

15:14.217 --> 15:17.307
KAT:
Okay, well, that bill
provides military aid

15:17.351 --> 15:20.267
to an important ally in
a region of the world

15:20.310 --> 15:22.965
we don't want to see fall under
China's sphere of influence.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.097
I understand that.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.620
H.R. 8365

15:25.663 --> 15:28.884
is also tied
to the release of the bodies

15:28.928 --> 15:30.842
of missing
American soldiers.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.322
An important priority.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.802
Yes.

15:33.845 --> 15:37.501
And given the fact that
this legislation would support

15:37.545 --> 15:40.156
Paraverse,
a major defense contractor

15:40.200 --> 15:42.506
in your own state, we're hoping

15:42.550 --> 15:44.856
that you'll reconsider
your position.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.123
I will not.
[chuckles]

15:50.166 --> 15:52.690
Would you please
explain why?

15:52.734 --> 15:55.171
Andrada is a
ruthless dictator

15:55.215 --> 15:57.913
whose government
is a notorious violator

15:57.957 --> 15:59.219
of human rights.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.961
Funneling money to his regime
is inconsistent

16:02.004 --> 16:03.397
with American values.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.747
But not as inconsistent
as letting that country fall

16:05.790 --> 16:08.054
into the hands
of fundamentalist extremists.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.620
The intelligence
I've seen suggests

16:09.664 --> 16:11.448
that is an unlikely scenario.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.059
Only if Andrada remains
in power.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.759
We are very aware

16:17.802 --> 16:20.196
of Andrada's
obvious shortcomings,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.633
but this Mindanao
Freedom Brigade

16:22.677 --> 16:25.114
makes him look
like Churchill.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.900
And sometimes you do have to
choose the lesser of two evils.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.641
No.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.469
The Dalton administration does.

16:32.513 --> 16:35.995
I have to look
my constituents in the eye.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.475
[laughs]
Please, um,

16:38.519 --> 16:41.087
tell the president I'm sorry.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.697
You bet.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.742
Okay. Thanks.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.834
Golly. Wow.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.098
[laughs]
Did we just meet

16:52.141 --> 16:54.056
one of the few
elected officials

16:54.100 --> 16:56.058
who puts principles first?

16:56.102 --> 16:58.321
That, or someone
dropped him on his head.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.931
[sighs]

16:59.975 --> 17:03.065
I'm not buying
either scenario.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.850
[scoffs, sighs]

17:07.287 --> 17:10.333
Who is Paraverse's
chief lobbyist?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.727
Hmm. Kah... Kah...

17:12.770 --> 17:14.511
Mickey Kensington.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.513
You know what?
I'll tell Jay.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.559
He's worked with him.
Great.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.217
Hold on, Mickey.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.957
You're saying that Callister
doesn't care about donors?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.351
Well, he's made a fortune
in high-tech.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.092
He doesn't need
Paraverse's money.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.660
But he damn sure needs their
votes in the next election.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.662
And Paraverse is one of the
state's largest employers.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.533
He won't support
foreign companies.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.231
What could be more apple pie

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
than an American
munitions manufacturer

17:40.233 --> 17:41.451
headquartered in Kentucky?

17:41.495 --> 17:43.062
One that's not founded by

17:43.105 --> 17:46.456
an immigrant from New Delhi
named Arjun Bhatt.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.589
Wait. What are
you telling me?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.591
Once you get past
the glossy facade,

17:50.634 --> 17:52.201
Callister gets dark
in a hurry.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.812
He's got deep ties
to nativist organizations,

17:54.856 --> 17:56.553
but since
he's not taking PAC money,

17:56.597 --> 17:58.381
the connections
are well concealed.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.558
So he won't help Filipinos
or naturalized Americans.

18:01.602 --> 18:04.431
Or anyone who doesn't come
from Anglo-Saxon stock.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.520
If you want
to get those bodies back,

18:06.563 --> 18:07.825
Callister's not your solution.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.393
He's our problem.
Mm.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.221
Thanks, Mickey.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.136
It's on me.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
Thank you.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.537
Ma'am, I think calling
President Andrada directly

18:23.580 --> 18:24.799
is not a good idea.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.627
By "not good," he means
apocalyptically bad.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.108
Well, I appreciate
the sage counsel,

18:29.151 --> 18:30.587
but you two just told me

18:30.631 --> 18:33.721
that Senator Racist Obstruction
isn't going to help us,

18:33.764 --> 18:35.723
so we need a new strategy.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.290
Ma'am, if I could put
a finer point on it:

18:37.333 --> 18:39.901
Andrada is a chauvinist who is
unlikely to meet with a woman

18:39.944 --> 18:42.295
whose last interaction with him
left him with a deviated septum.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.123
ANDRADA:
I wish I could help you,

18:44.166 --> 18:48.910
Madam Secretary, but the bodies
are in a remote jungle location.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.781
It's the rainy season.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.740
They will take time
to safely excavate.

18:52.783 --> 18:56.004
And we don't want
to endanger your men,

18:56.047 --> 18:58.702
so we have a detachment
of Marines at the ready

18:58.746 --> 19:00.878
who will conduct
the recovery mission.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.880
It's not just the weather.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.666
The jungle
where the bodies are located

19:05.709 --> 19:08.451
is a stronghold for
the Mindanao Freedom Brigade.

19:08.495 --> 19:13.282
I know how concerned
you are about the insurgency.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.023
President Dalton has authorized

19:15.066 --> 19:17.460
a detachment
of U.S. military advisers...

19:17.504 --> 19:18.722
I don't need advisers.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.811
I need assault rifles,

19:20.855 --> 19:24.075
armored personnel carriers,
drones.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.340
All of which will be forthcoming

19:27.383 --> 19:29.472
when Congress passes
the aid bill,

19:29.516 --> 19:33.868
which we expect will be before
the end of the current term.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.220
[Elizabeth sighs]

19:38.264 --> 19:40.222
President Andrada, my...

19:40.266 --> 19:43.747
my advisers were concerned

19:43.791 --> 19:47.316
that...
after our last encounter,

19:47.360 --> 19:50.189
you wouldn't be receptive to me,
but...

19:50.232 --> 19:52.408
but I disagreed,

19:52.452 --> 19:54.236
because I know
that you're a leader

19:54.280 --> 19:56.282
who wants what's best
for your country...Mm.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.893
...meaning you won't let
our unfortunate personal history

19:58.936 --> 20:00.329
be an impediment.

20:00.373 --> 20:03.027
You are correct.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.073
Our history is irrelevant.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.859
What is relevant
is that aid package.

20:10.121 --> 20:14.256
And when it arrives,
you can reclaim your dead.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.566
Good luck with the midterms.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.785
[beep]

20:23.309 --> 20:27.965
I have no update yet,
and I have to cancel lunch.

20:28.009 --> 20:31.578
Well, I'm not here
to pressure you,

20:31.621 --> 20:34.102
but the polls open
in a few days.

20:34.145 --> 20:37.061
I'm flying to Manila
to meet with President Andrada,

20:37.105 --> 20:38.802
and I need to prepare, okay?

20:38.846 --> 20:41.152
Mm... not okay.

20:41.196 --> 20:44.025
Diplomacy at a
distance is one thing,

20:44.068 --> 20:46.897
but the last time...The next person who brings up
Andrada's nose-- I'm gonna

20:46.941 --> 20:48.421
punch him in the face.I'm saying,

20:48.464 --> 20:50.074
you're not exactly the poster
child for dÃ©tente here.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.120
We are out of options and time.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.471
President Dalton asked me
to get involved for a reason.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.734
Just the most modest
vote of confidence

20:57.778 --> 21:01.347
in my ability to do my job
would be great.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.913
[unzipping]Aah!

21:02.957 --> 21:04.959
Sorry. My confidence

21:05.002 --> 21:08.702
in your ability is
anything but modest.

21:08.745 --> 21:12.183
Believe it or not, my anxiety
isn't just about the midterms.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.924
It's-it's...Also about the midterms.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.230
Yes, about the midterms.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.885
But I care about this issue.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.974
Same reason everybody else does.

21:22.977 --> 21:26.285
Andrada has been harping on
about disrespect.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.461
It's a pretext
to shake us down.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.333
The Secretary of State shows up
in Manila, the pretext is gone.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.597
We now have leverage
to call him out.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.123
Well, can't
argue with that.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.343
I'm gonna bring 'em home,
Russell.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.389
I promise.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.566
Godspeed,
Madam Secretary.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.089
Russell.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.220
[clears throat]

21:49.264 --> 21:51.222
Whatever it is,
I got to pack.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.920
So if it can wait...JAY: It can't.

21:52.963 --> 21:56.402
This is an intervention.The important thing to do

21:56.445 --> 21:58.491
is to keep centered
and calm.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.840
About what?

21:59.883 --> 22:01.885
Ma'am.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.498
[chuckles]

22:05.541 --> 22:07.500
"A forcible and noisy expulsion

22:07.543 --> 22:11.330
of the Secretary of State's
family."

22:14.245 --> 22:17.423
We know your first instinct
is to publicly respond.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.382
And we are all here
to urge you not to.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.516
I'm not going to
respond publicly.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.213
It would be beneath
the administration

22:25.256 --> 22:28.347
to attack a private business.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.000
Well put, ma'am.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.480
Well put.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.701
I'm going to ignore it.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.180
MATT: That's good.
That's good.Good.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.182
KAT: Okay. Well
done. Just ignore.Hear, hear.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.183
Just ignore.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.750
[sighs]

22:40.794 --> 22:43.057
[clears throat]

22:43.100 --> 22:45.059
Did that work?MATT:
I don't know.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.669
I can't read
that lady.Yeah, me neither.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.889
She's either chill...Or she's gonna kill someone.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.413
ELIZABETH:
Coming after my family?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.545
I... HENRY: Babe,

22:52.588 --> 22:54.416
this is just a taste
of the kind of stuff

22:54.460 --> 22:56.200
we're gonna have to
get used to if you're

22:56.244 --> 22:57.593
throwing your hat
in the ring.I know.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.814
But I just feel like every day
that I do this job

23:00.857 --> 23:02.076
undermines my chances

23:02.119 --> 23:03.512
to do that one.

23:03.556 --> 23:06.080
Our restaurant eviction
is hardly a scarlet letter.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.473
No, it's not just that.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.390
A Secretary of State's mandate
is to compromise.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.870
Lose the battle to win the war.

23:13.914 --> 23:17.004
Nowadays it seems like
a successful candidate

23:17.047 --> 23:18.875
has to appear resolute,

23:18.919 --> 23:20.921
unyielding.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.143
You know the last Secretary
of State to become president?

23:26.187 --> 23:28.058
James Buchanan.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.887
150 years ago.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.150
Well, even the Cubbies
eventually won

23:33.194 --> 23:34.891
the World Series.
[chuckles]

23:35.936 --> 23:37.633
Streaks are made to be broken.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.157
By the way,

23:40.201 --> 23:41.463
I need to thank you.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.857
Don't get used to it.
You're on dishes next week.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.162
[chuckles]

23:45.206 --> 23:46.468
No.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.644
Thanks, Frank.You got it.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.995
I got to thank you for bringing
home those dead soldiers.

23:52.039 --> 23:56.347
I mean, you know that I lost
some friends from basic.

23:56.391 --> 24:00.526
The thought of leaving
those guys where they fell is...

24:00.569 --> 24:02.571
It's an important mission.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.575
And I'm the one
entrusted with it.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.490
That should be
a declaration, babe.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.623
That sounds like a question.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.148
You don't have misgivings
about me going

24:14.191 --> 24:15.715
face-to-face with...Yeah, I have misgivings.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.457
I hate that you're gonna be
in the same room as the guy.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.807
You're gonna be okay.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.461
Yeah, I got this.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.462
Good.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.680
Bring our heroes home.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.421
I will.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.076
Be safe.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.120
Mm.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.559
[door closes]

24:34.603 --> 24:35.952
MARJORIE:
I need you to copy

24:35.996 --> 24:39.086
talking points for Craig's
next round of interviews.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.392
Wait, there's a mistake here.

24:41.436 --> 24:44.134
Candidate approved it.
There's no mistake.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.487
[speaking indistinctly]

24:48.530 --> 24:51.402
Craig, can I
have a second?

24:52.403 --> 24:54.014
Sure. What's up, Ali?

24:54.057 --> 24:55.885
One of the cornerstones
of your campaign

24:55.929 --> 24:57.800
is student loan
forgiveness.Right, right.

24:57.844 --> 25:00.499
But someone forgot to include
it in the talking points

25:00.542 --> 25:02.544
for your upcoming
appearances.[chuckles]

25:02.588 --> 25:04.720
Well, that someone was me.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.374
But I promise you
I didn't forget.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.029
Uh, latest tracking polls
show that this issue

25:09.072 --> 25:11.422
is a... a third rail
for the voters.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.077
You know, unfortunately,
the many funding the few.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.863
But-but, in time, the
few become the many.

25:16.906 --> 25:20.083
Right. And, in time,
I hope to revisit the issue.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.608
But job one is to get
a seat at the table.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.784
Then we can talk about
how to divvy up the food.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.133
Yeah?

25:26.176 --> 25:28.744
Hey, keep up
the good work, okay?

25:28.788 --> 25:30.790
Sure. Thanks.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.494
[grunting]

25:49.156 --> 25:50.940
President Andrada,

25:50.984 --> 25:52.942
we had a meeting calendared

25:52.986 --> 25:55.510
this morning
at your office.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.599
Yes.

25:57.643 --> 26:01.255
But I needed
some exercise.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.996
[exhales]

26:07.827 --> 26:09.611
[shouting, grunting]

26:09.655 --> 26:11.657
[cameras clicking]

26:13.876 --> 26:15.878
[exhales]

26:17.880 --> 26:21.492
Mr. President, I traveled
8,000 miles to make an appeal

26:21.536 --> 26:23.756
on behalf of President Dalton
for the return

26:23.799 --> 26:24.974
of our war dead.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.846
Well, I hope you did
not come empty-handed.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.806
I come with a promise.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.896
We will eventually push
that aid package through.

26:33.940 --> 26:37.378
But you need to give us
those bodies back right now.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.685
[chuckles]

26:39.728 --> 26:43.340
You do not show up
in my country

26:43.384 --> 26:45.604
and step into my gym

26:45.647 --> 26:47.910
and tell me what to do.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.826
No.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.915
But you're on record

26:52.959 --> 26:56.179
saying that the U.S.
was disrespecting you.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.790
But I'm here now,

26:57.833 --> 27:01.097
showing you more respect
than you deserve.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.535
[cameras clicking]

27:04.579 --> 27:06.189
Talking to me
this way,

27:06.233 --> 27:08.191
that is respect?

27:08.235 --> 27:10.541
Surrender those bodies,
Mr. President,

27:10.585 --> 27:14.371
or your people find out
that you begged for U.S. aid,

27:14.415 --> 27:18.462
which will make you look
as weak as you really are.

27:20.247 --> 27:24.077
You are the weak one,
standing there, begging.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.341
If you prefer...

27:27.384 --> 27:28.690
to fight,

27:28.734 --> 27:31.040
we can settle this in the ring!

27:31.084 --> 27:32.868
[grunts]

27:32.912 --> 27:34.914
[sighs]

27:37.481 --> 27:40.223
I hung up my gloves.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.138
You will release
a statement

27:42.182 --> 27:44.663
that those bodies
are being extracted.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.752
Or I'm going to release one

27:46.795 --> 27:48.841
about how you
really broke your nose.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.800
Meaning how I broke it.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.498
Understood?

27:54.542 --> 27:57.153
Great.

27:57.197 --> 27:59.199
[cameras clicking]

27:59.242 --> 28:01.070
Bye, Mr. President.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.647
[sighs]BECKER: How's the jet lag?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.170
I'm too tired to talk about it.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.826
There's a C-17 transport over
the Philippine Sea right now

28:17.870 --> 28:21.612
carrying the remains
of 31 American soldiers.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.614
You brought our
people home.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.052
And without precipitating
an international incident.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.662
Oh, please.[chuckles]

28:27.706 --> 28:30.317
The summit was handled with...

28:30.360 --> 28:32.623
[inhales, exhales]

28:32.667 --> 28:34.756
[chuckles]:
...restraint and decorum.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.758
[chuckles]

28:36.802 --> 28:38.368
Good work, Elizabeth.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.631
Thank you.Now the bad news.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.677
[sighs]
Come on.

28:44.897 --> 28:47.638
David Paley isn't getting
a military funeral?

28:47.682 --> 28:49.902
I'm afraid not.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.382
We dug up personnel
files on all the dead.

28:52.426 --> 28:54.733
Came across
something troubling.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.386
He went AWOL?

28:56.430 --> 28:58.388
Right before his
last mission.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.173
18 hours unaccounted for.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.914
Suspected desertion.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.003
Came back to his post
in time to be deployed.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.700
So then why'd they let him fly?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.180
Didn't realize his
transgression until after

29:07.223 --> 29:10.096
his plane went missing.With Paley declared

29:10.139 --> 29:12.228
a combat death,
there was no reason

29:12.272 --> 29:14.622
to throw dirt on his memory.No.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.190
But now everything's
come to light.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.714
Department of Veterans
Affairs does not want

29:19.758 --> 29:21.890
to afford him a
burial with honors.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.588
Well, who can overrule that?

29:24.632 --> 29:26.242
This is Gloria Paley's father.

29:26.286 --> 29:28.114
He's a war hero, Mr. President,

29:28.157 --> 29:29.680
who gave his life
for his country.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.900
And he also went AWOL,
an act which would have resulted

29:31.944 --> 29:32.814
in his court-martial

29:32.858 --> 29:34.076
had he not died
in combat.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.557
But he did die.
And instead of paying tribute

29:36.600 --> 29:38.907
to his sacrifice,
we're disgracing his memory.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.562
No. We're just
not honoring it.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.652
Henry,

29:44.695 --> 29:46.959
you are conspicuous
by your silence.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.656
I'd like your input,

29:48.699 --> 29:50.832
as a Marine
and an ethicist.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.225
Well, Mr. President,

29:52.268 --> 29:54.227
I think a life has to
be looked at in toto.

29:54.270 --> 29:57.143
Paley flew 142 missions
with distinction.

29:57.186 --> 30:00.102
After three years in combat,
he reached his breaking point.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.582
But he didn't break. He bent.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.670
Which would urge

30:02.713 --> 30:04.541
commendation,
not censure.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.108
What kind of message
would it send

30:06.152 --> 30:08.719
if his daughter's
tireless efforts were rewarded

30:08.763 --> 30:11.287
with this kind
of rebuke?

30:11.331 --> 30:13.289
So...
[grunts]

30:13.333 --> 30:16.466
compassion over... process.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.903
In this instance,

30:17.946 --> 30:20.514
that would be
my recommendation, yes.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.603
This is not an
academic matter.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.779
It has consequences.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.826
If you don't follow orders,
people die.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.437
If you don't
punish deserters,

30:30.480 --> 30:31.786
they desert.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.049
And if you don't recognize
heroism,

30:34.093 --> 30:37.270
you discourage heroics.

30:37.313 --> 30:40.969
DALTON: Maybe. But as
commander in chief,

30:41.013 --> 30:43.885
it falls to me
to enforce military protocol.

30:43.929 --> 30:47.367
That takes
precedence.

30:47.410 --> 30:48.585
I'm sorry, Bess.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.500
Gordon, you'll have
to inform Ms. Paley.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.720
Yes, sir.

30:53.764 --> 30:56.115
If it's all right with you...

30:56.158 --> 30:57.464
Of course.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.031
It's fine.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.076
ELIZABETH:
Mr. President.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.211
[footsteps approaching]

31:05.254 --> 31:07.082
STEVIE:
Hey.
Hey.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.345
What you watching?

31:09.389 --> 31:11.870
My Uncle William.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.308
It's the only footage
we have of him.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.527
Right before
he shipped out.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.660
Can I...?

31:19.703 --> 31:21.705
Yeah.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.926
Did you know that
Uncle William was scouted

31:24.970 --> 31:27.233
by the Washington Senators
his senior year of high school?

31:27.276 --> 31:28.408
Was he really?Yep.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.235
Wow.They offered him

31:29.278 --> 31:30.366
a minor league contract

31:30.410 --> 31:32.934
for the day he got
home from the war.

31:36.285 --> 31:39.114
So much to live for.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.247
Doughnuts.
They're still hot.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.596
Hi, Dad.Bye.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.945
Bye.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.600
Where you going?Out. I'll be back.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.123
Okay, sweetheart.

31:49.777 --> 31:52.084
No. We haven't had
dinner yet.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.825
You don't want a doughnut?
What's wrong?

31:56.349 --> 31:58.177
[door closes in distance]

31:59.482 --> 32:01.920
David Paley.

32:01.963 --> 32:05.053
The truth is going to break
his daughter's heart.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.837
Yes, it will.

32:06.881 --> 32:10.841
So give me the case
for keeping her in the dark.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.843
Well...
[clears throat]

32:12.887 --> 32:15.237
[sighs] Aquinas
suggested that...

32:15.281 --> 32:18.371
Oh, that guy again....honesty wasn't an
absolute virtue.

32:18.414 --> 32:22.941
Uh, what he was getting at
was that the damage

32:22.984 --> 32:24.943
that truth can inflict

32:24.986 --> 32:29.382
should be factored into
the ethical calculus.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.429
Well, I'm not Aquinas;
I'm the Secretary of State.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.997
And my remit is not
to shine that woman on

32:36.041 --> 32:38.478
after 73 years of waiting.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.480
Fair enough.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.351
But...

32:42.395 --> 32:45.702
there might be a way
to soften the blow.

32:45.746 --> 32:49.402
It has to do with
Captain Paley's file.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.883
Why don't you have a doughnut,
and I'll tell you about it.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.495
Come on.

32:55.538 --> 32:57.366
Who are we kidding?
I'm gonna have six.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.238
Well, have six.

32:59.281 --> 33:03.068
Oh, God.
It makes me want to cry.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.288
RUSSELL:
Great job, Bess.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.334
You brought honor
to our dead.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.727
So...

33:10.771 --> 33:13.121
why the "we've
got trouble" face?

33:13.165 --> 33:14.340
[sighs heavily]

33:14.383 --> 33:16.081
Not "we" this time.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.734
Just you.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.651
L'affaire Pynchon.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.740
I've been doing this long
enough to know the public

33:23.784 --> 33:27.527
doesn't usually take cabinet
secretaries' families to task

33:27.570 --> 33:29.616
for administration policies.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.402
Well, it's a brave new world.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.056
Yeah, and a treacherous one.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.927
So I played a cynical hunch.

33:36.971 --> 33:39.104
Had one of my people
dig into the guy

33:39.147 --> 33:41.410
who gave Henry
and Stevie the boot.

33:41.454 --> 33:44.196
Pynchon owner Trevor Bentley
was college roommates

33:44.239 --> 33:47.329
with Senator
Owen Callister.

33:47.373 --> 33:48.765
Yep.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.419
Well, that doesn't
necessarily...

33:50.463 --> 33:51.899
Keep reading.

33:55.685 --> 33:59.428
They share season
tickets to the Caps.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.735
And... vacation together

34:01.778 --> 34:03.824
every summer in Rehoboth.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.957
Well, it looks like I need
to have a little talk

34:07.001 --> 34:09.656
with the senator.Yeah. I'm gonna urge
against that.

34:11.832 --> 34:14.530
He took a cheap shot
at my family, Russell.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.576
Because he wants
to draw you out.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.056
You know why?

34:20.145 --> 34:23.191
Because he suspects
I'm running.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.150
And he probably is, too.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.281
[clicks tongue]

34:26.325 --> 34:27.978
Which is why
he's taking shots,

34:28.022 --> 34:29.458
hoping you'll
defend yourself,

34:29.502 --> 34:32.461
which you can't do
until you've declared.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.897
Because there's a
difference between

34:33.941 --> 34:35.638
being a Secretary of State
and a candidate.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.858
You're debating him
on the campaign trail,

34:37.901 --> 34:39.164
you can call him out
on anything,

34:39.207 --> 34:42.428
but a cabinet secretary
getting personal, well,

34:42.471 --> 34:45.039
that smacks of bad judgment
and plays into his hands.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.737
I can't let this
go unanswered.
No.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.264
But you don't have to be
the one who answers.

34:52.307 --> 34:54.701
OWEN:
Hey, Kat. Come on in.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.791
To what do I owe
the honor?

34:57.834 --> 35:01.969
Oh, just the Secretary of
State's sense of restraint.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.972
I'm sorry?
[chuckles]

35:05.015 --> 35:06.452
Senator, you've been
a vocal critic

35:06.495 --> 35:08.976
of the Dalton
administration.

35:09.019 --> 35:12.371
And, uh, I will
continue to be so.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.546
I'm assuming
you're familiar

35:13.589 --> 35:15.635
with the concept
of loyal opposition?

35:15.678 --> 35:17.637
Oh, I'm very familiar
with it, sir.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.856
Except the only thing
you've opposed

35:19.900 --> 35:22.337
is our foreign policy.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.470
Yeah, trade deals,
peace treaties,

35:24.513 --> 35:26.646
immigration initiatives.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.170
I'm a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.780
Oh, you're also
on agriculture.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.087
And one of Kentucky's biggest
industries is farming,

35:33.131 --> 35:35.263
and yet, not a word about
subsidies or price controls

35:35.307 --> 35:37.178
or anything that would
play to your base.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.615
Just foreign policy.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.445
For the senator of
a landlocked state.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.186
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.669
You didn't block that aid
package out of principle;

35:49.712 --> 35:52.324
you did it because you knew
the mess you were making

35:52.367 --> 35:55.022
would land on Secretary McCord,
and she'd be stained by it.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.110
What's your point?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.243
You're running for president.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.855
[chuckles] And you're
trying to eliminate

36:01.898 --> 36:04.031
someone you're afraid
could be your competition.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.686
Whoa. What... Whatever
I may or may not be doing,

36:06.729 --> 36:10.211
I certainly don't have
to explain myself

36:10.255 --> 36:12.735
to a cabinet secretary's
policy advisor.

36:12.779 --> 36:15.999
And a queer Latinx woman
at that. Wow.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.610
Everything you hate.

36:17.653 --> 36:20.221
[chuckles]: It must be
really hard for you.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.311
Squeezing you in today,
Kat, was a courtesy.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.835
Oh.A concept you seem
relatively unfamiliar with.

36:25.879 --> 36:29.012
If you have a message for me,
I suggest you send it.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.276
Well, then here it is.
You've made this personal.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.887
And if you ever use my
boss's family again,

36:33.930 --> 36:36.585
the next visit you will
get will not be from me.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.240
It'll be from her, and she won't
be here as Secretary of State

36:39.284 --> 36:41.895
or as a candidate; she
will be here as a mother

36:41.938 --> 36:43.331
protecting her own.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.681
And believe me,
that is the one way

36:45.725 --> 36:48.380
you do not want to
meet Madam Secretary.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.601
Is that a threat?

36:52.645 --> 36:55.604
Oh, no, Senator.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.911
That was a gift.
[chuckles softly]

37:05.745 --> 37:08.095
My father died for this
country, Madam Secretary,

37:08.138 --> 37:11.490
and this is the way
his nation repays him?

37:11.533 --> 37:13.274
I'm so sorry.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.103
But the all-powerful
bureaucracy

37:16.146 --> 37:19.324
has spoken, right?

37:19.367 --> 37:22.370
And they've branded
my father a coward.

37:22.414 --> 37:23.676
He wasn't a coward.

37:23.719 --> 37:27.332
He was a hero!

37:34.339 --> 37:37.080
The only thing
that I have control of

37:37.124 --> 37:38.821
is what I tell you.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.606
I chose to tell you
the truth,

37:40.649 --> 37:43.522
because I think
it is the least you are owed.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.484
But it doesn't
take away the pain.

37:49.528 --> 37:53.271
No. I don't imagine
that it does.

37:54.707 --> 37:57.666
But I think that
we may have found a way

37:57.710 --> 38:00.713
to cushion the blow
just a little bit.

38:02.932 --> 38:06.980
Your father's file
will remain classified.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.593
But when people ask...

38:11.637 --> 38:15.554
why he's not in Arlington,
like everyone else,

38:15.597 --> 38:17.033
what do I say?

38:17.077 --> 38:20.602
You tell them that you opted
for a private family funeral

38:20.646 --> 38:22.561
in your hometown.

38:22.604 --> 38:25.172
And because
his record is sealed,

38:25.215 --> 38:27.087
the David Paley
Foundation's work,

38:27.130 --> 38:29.394
the work that you
have devoted your life to,

38:29.437 --> 38:32.397
will continue
in his name.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.095
So his legacy is secure.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.488
Forever.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.491
And he's coming home, Gloria.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.848
Preliminary results
from congressional races

38:48.891 --> 38:51.416
have started to roll in.

38:51.459 --> 38:54.506
Oh, hey.I thought you were
headed to Dover.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.203
Yeah, I am.
I've got about...

38:56.246 --> 38:59.554
three minutes to get
dressed and grab a bar

38:59.598 --> 39:01.208
and get out the door.

39:01.251 --> 39:05.908
Don't you have an
election party to get to?No, I quit.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.214
Why?

39:07.257 --> 39:09.129
You know that student loan
forgiveness thing?

39:09.172 --> 39:10.130
Yeah.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.566
Pavano bailed on it.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.438
Oh.
[sniffs]

39:13.481 --> 39:15.918
Your guy had clay feet, huh?

39:15.962 --> 39:19.139
Not my guy.
Not anymore.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.576
I didn't even
vote for him.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.491
You voted for Winter?

39:23.535 --> 39:25.972
No. I didn't vote
for anyone.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.932
What?

39:29.976 --> 39:33.675
All of these guys
are exactly the same, Mom.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.771
How much of what

39:42.815 --> 39:44.947
Pavano stood for
did you believe in?

39:44.991 --> 39:46.471
It doesn't matter.

39:46.514 --> 39:49.125
That jerk bailed on his
loan forgiveness initiative.

39:49.169 --> 39:52.041
And my generation isn't putting
up with hypocrites anymore.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.695
It's a new day.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.219
So, say, 95%?

39:56.263 --> 39:58.004
You're not even listening to me.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.397
Oh, I got the gist.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.921
Y-You're guy compromised,

40:01.964 --> 40:04.140
and...

40:04.184 --> 40:07.796
now you're checking out
of the process completely?

40:07.840 --> 40:10.886
Look, there will be
other elections.
No. Uh-uh.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.758
Nope.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.935
I am sorry that you
were disillusioned.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.632
Get used to it, Alison,

40:17.676 --> 40:19.939
because democracy
is flawed.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.768
And the next candidate
who doesn't let you down

40:22.811 --> 40:24.334
will be the first.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.685
I just flew halfway
around the world

40:26.728 --> 40:28.469
to recover the
bodies of patriots

40:28.513 --> 40:31.167
who gave their lives to
protect this country.

40:31.211 --> 40:34.388
They died along with
hundreds of thousands

40:34.432 --> 40:36.477
of Americans
in too many wars

40:36.521 --> 40:38.740
so Alison McCord could
have the right to vote.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.916
And you won't honor that

40:40.960 --> 40:44.267
because your guy caved
on a single issue?

40:45.617 --> 40:47.619
My polling place
is in Silver Spring.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.360
I won't even make it in time.That's what a
motorcade is for.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.275
I'll drop you off
on my way to Dover.

40:52.319 --> 40:53.929
Get dressed.Oh.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.976
