00:00.879 --> 00:02.658
- [Gordon's Voiceover]
Tonight on Hotel Hell,

00:02.658 --> 00:03.628
in Northern California,

00:03.628 --> 00:06.321
near Sacramento, a 200 year old hotel.

00:06.321 --> 00:09.751
- This is the actual bed that
President Grant slept in.

00:09.751 --> 00:12.794
- [Gordon's Voiceover] -is
about to become history.

00:12.794 --> 00:14.318
- Look at the mould on that.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.187
- [Gordon's Voiceover] Three buddies

00:15.187 --> 00:16.363
decided to buy the business.

00:16.363 --> 00:18.674
- It's like dumb and dumber and dumbest.

00:18.674 --> 00:20.875
Are you guys really the fucking owners?

00:20.875 --> 00:21.743
- True story.

00:21.743 --> 00:23.273
- [Gordon's Voiceover] In
fact they're so busy drinking.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.242
- Were you drunk?
- Yes.

00:24.242 --> 00:26.228
- Drink free from me.

00:26.228 --> 00:27.096
- [Gordon's Voiceover] Dancing.

00:27.096 --> 00:28.559
- They really like to give lap dances.

00:28.559 --> 00:29.824
- Lap dance.

00:29.824 --> 00:30.877
- [Gordon's Voiceover] -and having fun,

00:30.877 --> 00:32.761
that the hotel and the guests.

00:32.761 --> 00:34.593
- Do we ask you to check in for the room

00:34.593 --> 00:36.286
- [Gordon's Voiceover] - are neglected.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.714
If I don't do something soon,

00:37.714 --> 00:40.186
the town will lose its most
important historic building

00:40.186 --> 00:41.283
to a bunch of frat boys.

00:41.283 --> 00:42.617
(bar chatter)

00:42.617 --> 00:43.486
- Boys and girls.

00:43.486 --> 00:46.353
(electric music)

01:10.038 --> 01:12.343
Surrounded by the stunning
vineyards of the Sierra,

01:12.343 --> 01:15.127
Nevada foothills is Murphy's California,

01:15.127 --> 01:18.860
a picturesque destination for
wine enthusiasts and tourists.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.424
This historic town has been home

01:20.424 --> 01:23.844
to Murphy's Hotel for over 150 years.

01:23.844 --> 01:26.200
The hotel has an illustrious history.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.566
Presidents and legends

01:27.566 --> 01:30.173
have come to stay in
this national landmark.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.495
Partners, Brian, Kevin, and Joel

01:32.495 --> 01:35.595
bought the business nine months ago.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.701
- I own the hotel with my two partners.

01:37.701 --> 01:38.570
I run the dining room.

01:38.570 --> 01:40.027
I'm the dining room manager

01:40.027 --> 01:41.726
Kevin, he's our bar manager.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.593
And Joel, he's our chef.

01:43.593 --> 01:45.857
- Wonderful. Thank you.

01:45.857 --> 01:47.607
- [Gordon's Voiceover]
But it's no one's job

01:47.607 --> 01:49.317
to look after the hotel.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.214
- It's historic

01:50.214 --> 01:51.992
but I think it needs to be maintenanced.

01:51.992 --> 01:54.078
(instrumental music)

01:54.078 --> 01:55.542
- The historic rooms,

01:55.542 --> 01:57.833
I wouldn't even stay in
them and I get a discount.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.289
- That's the air conditioner.

01:59.289 --> 02:00.778
- That's it.

02:00.778 --> 02:02.466
- [Gordon's Voiceover] Behind
the historic main building,

02:02.466 --> 02:05.667
there are 20 so-called modern bedrooms.

02:05.667 --> 02:09.702
- The modern rooms are
maybe modern in the '60s.

02:09.702 --> 02:10.571
- These are modern?

02:10.571 --> 02:12.851
- This looks like my grandma's room.

02:12.851 --> 02:13.946
- Smells like it too.

02:17.061 --> 02:18.888
- [Gordon's Voiceover] Sadly,
the owners are too busy

02:18.888 --> 02:21.618
drinking in the bar to notice
the state of the hotel.

02:21.618 --> 02:22.809
- Oh man.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.052
Owning a bar at 32 years old
can be just a great party

02:26.052 --> 02:27.056
seven days a week.

02:28.241 --> 02:30.515
- [Reveler] Give him some
tongue, lady, some tongue!

02:30.515 --> 02:31.570
- What are you ladies out doing tonight?

02:31.570 --> 02:32.975
- What do you think we're doing?

02:32.975 --> 02:34.612
- Kevin and I, we love women.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.780
And it is a passion.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.438
And we have a lot of
them coming through here.

02:37.438 --> 02:39.475
- [Kevin] Don't act like
you've never done it.

02:39.475 --> 02:41.109
- They're not just all young.

02:41.109 --> 02:43.434
We got the Cougar clans
coming through here.

02:43.434 --> 02:44.664
We're not one to discriminate.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.148
We take customer service
to the next level.

02:47.148 --> 02:49.127
Cheers, boys and girls.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.065
- Put 'em up.

02:50.065 --> 02:52.464
- As a California American male,

02:52.464 --> 02:54.122
we were taught during college,

02:54.122 --> 02:56.750
that it's good, binge drinking is fun.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.324
(revellers cheering)

02:58.324 --> 02:59.450
Why's everybody empty?

02:59.450 --> 03:01.194
And I am the fun captain.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.184
- She tried to roofie me, you see that?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.478
I am the party guy.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.628
I wanna make everyone have fun.

03:08.628 --> 03:12.306
(upbeat pop music)

03:12.306 --> 03:15.306
- Right now, they're just drunk idiots.

03:15.306 --> 03:17.718
- [Gordon's Voiceover] If you
are after a drunken lap dance

03:17.718 --> 03:19.334
you've come to the right place.

03:19.334 --> 03:22.326
If you want a good night's
sleep, you best go elsewhere.

03:22.326 --> 03:23.224
- I'm exhausted.

03:23.224 --> 03:26.800
And I keep hearing these
loud noises outside.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.563
These people that are drunk
and it's driving me crazy.

03:29.563 --> 03:30.798
And I'm gonna go complain.

03:30.798 --> 03:34.698
- Shots! Shots! Shots! (upbeat music)

03:34.698 --> 03:35.566
- What can I do for you?

03:35.566 --> 03:36.623
- I have a room upstairs.
- Sure.

03:36.623 --> 03:38.270
- It's really noisy.

03:38.270 --> 03:40.032
- The saloon is always first.

03:40.032 --> 03:43.637
And then the hotel just
seems like an afterthought.

03:43.637 --> 03:45.590
- [Gordon's Voiceover] This
registered national landmark

03:45.590 --> 03:49.051
is being run ragged by the owners
and is haemorrhaging money.

03:49.051 --> 03:50.553
- If the guys continue to party

03:50.553 --> 03:52.127
and not take things seriously

03:52.127 --> 03:53.751
the hotel's just gonna close down.

03:53.751 --> 03:55.349
- [Gordon's Voiceover] If
I don't do something fast,

03:55.349 --> 03:59.333
this place won't last another
150 days, let alone years.

03:59.333 --> 04:03.441
I think Gordon is going
to say, "Fuck this place."

04:03.441 --> 04:04.528
They're screwed.

04:08.262 --> 04:10.399
(upbeat music)

04:10.399 --> 04:13.722
- I'm on my way to Murphy's
in Northern California.

04:13.722 --> 04:16.192
Now this place is in
among some of the most

04:16.192 --> 04:18.610
stunning vineyards anywhere in the world.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.084
(electric music)

04:21.084 --> 04:22.220
What a beautiful town?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.055
Look how busy this places as well.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.568
Lesser with stunning little tasting rooms.

04:26.568 --> 04:29.019
Now, anyone lucky enough to
be running a small hotel here,

04:29.019 --> 04:31.375
should be sold out every night.

04:31.375 --> 04:34.476
If they're not they must be
doing something seriously wrong.

04:34.476 --> 04:37.725
(rock music)

04:37.725 --> 04:40.767
(piano beat music)

04:43.158 --> 04:45.764
Wow, this really is historic.

04:45.764 --> 04:46.984
Murphy's Hotel has been placed

04:46.984 --> 04:50.081
in the national register
of historic places.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.187
Nice.

04:51.187 --> 04:52.779
Wow.

04:52.779 --> 04:53.647
- Hello.

04:53.647 --> 04:54.516
- How are you?

04:54.516 --> 04:55.384
- I'm good. How are you doing?

04:55.384 --> 04:56.253
- So first name is?

04:56.253 --> 04:57.122
- Conetha.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.037
- Conetha.
- Nice to meet you.

04:58.037 --> 05:00.790
- Is it always that busy out there?

05:00.790 --> 05:03.366
- We usually do get pretty
busy on the weekends.

05:03.366 --> 05:04.325
- Incredible.

05:04.325 --> 05:05.941
- We have about 16 tasting rooms

05:05.941 --> 05:08.329
just within walking distance of the hotel.

05:08.329 --> 05:10.080
- I love how historic this place is

05:10.080 --> 05:12.763
but have you not updated
the furniture since 1850?

05:12.763 --> 05:15.346
(instrumental music)

05:15.346 --> 05:16.722
Bloody hell

05:16.722 --> 05:19.121
My God, it's like going
into your grandma's funeral.

05:19.121 --> 05:20.601
My God.

05:20.601 --> 05:22.822
- There definitely is a
difference between historic

05:22.822 --> 05:24.105
and then tacky and old.

05:24.105 --> 05:25.867
What we have is definitely tacky.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.623
- It looks like someone's
died in those chairs.

05:29.610 --> 05:31.101
So you've been here for a long time?

05:31.101 --> 05:32.164
- About a year and a half.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.261
- And what's wrong with the place?

05:34.261 --> 05:36.868
- Well, management, the owners.

05:36.868 --> 05:38.807
The hotel is owned by three guys.

05:38.807 --> 05:40.006
They're in their early 30s.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.873
There's Kevin, Joel, and Brian.

05:41.873 --> 05:43.687
And they really like to use the hotel

05:43.687 --> 05:46.909
as their playground, partying, drinking,

05:46.909 --> 05:49.175
giving lap dances to the bar patrons.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.384
- Lap dance?

05:53.384 --> 05:54.667
- Lap dances

05:54.667 --> 05:56.575
while they're bartending.

05:56.575 --> 05:58.347
The owners if they continue partying

05:58.347 --> 05:59.901
and giving lap dances in the bar

05:59.901 --> 06:01.747
and acting how they've been,

06:01.747 --> 06:04.479
the place is just gonna
keep going downhill.

06:04.479 --> 06:08.100
We put you in the Presidential
Ulysses S. Grant room.

06:09.296 --> 06:12.205
This is the actual bed that
President Grant slept in

06:12.205 --> 06:13.074
except for the mattress.

06:13.074 --> 06:13.942
We did get rid of that.

06:13.942 --> 06:15.072
- What's the glass box for?

06:15.072 --> 06:17.054
- This is our display room.

06:17.054 --> 06:17.922
- Display room?

06:17.922 --> 06:21.551
- Yes. So guests and customers
can come up and take a look.

06:22.570 --> 06:24.405
- When were these last

06:24.405 --> 06:25.364
replaced?

06:25.364 --> 06:26.866
Dreadful.

06:26.866 --> 06:27.734
Oh shit.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.879
- I can't really tell you that.

06:29.879 --> 06:32.361
- It sounds like I'm in a museum.

06:32.361 --> 06:34.019
So am I guest or an exhibit?

06:34.019 --> 06:34.905
- You're a guest.

06:36.302 --> 06:37.171
- Darling,

06:38.228 --> 06:41.338
who are those people there?

06:41.338 --> 06:43.193
- Come on through everybody,
and take a look inside.

06:43.193 --> 06:45.137
- Oh my gosh.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.476
- Ulysses S. Grant room.

06:47.476 --> 06:48.344
- Close the door, honey.

06:48.344 --> 06:49.274
Close the door.

06:49.274 --> 06:51.307
- We're gonna be on display today.

06:51.307 --> 06:54.059
It's usual for the tourists
to come through sometimes.

06:54.059 --> 06:56.072
And if a guest checks in and
they just, for some reason

06:56.072 --> 06:57.552
forget to close their door,

06:57.552 --> 07:00.576
they're gonna have people
crowded around, looking at them.

07:01.476 --> 07:03.298
- They literally come over and they...

07:03.298 --> 07:05.008
Hello.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.645
Hi.

07:06.645 --> 07:08.067
- Well, that's embarrassing.

07:08.067 --> 07:10.096
- It's like a goldfish bowl in here.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.664
- Ladies, thank God, I wasn't
in my underpants. (laughter)

07:13.664 --> 07:14.533
Is that all?

07:14.533 --> 07:15.904
They just come and have a look around.

07:15.904 --> 07:16.856
- Yeah.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.816
We normally get complaints

07:18.816 --> 07:21.107
and there's really no
one that handles that

07:21.107 --> 07:21.976
or takes care of it.

07:21.976 --> 07:23.297
- But there's three owners.

07:23.297 --> 07:24.621
- Yes. A lot of the time they're busy

07:24.621 --> 07:26.766
bartending or drinking or-

07:26.766 --> 07:29.512
- Or lap dancing.
- Or lap dancing, exactly.

07:29.512 --> 07:31.294
Unfortunately.

07:31.294 --> 07:32.162
- I'm gonna unpack.

07:32.162 --> 07:34.788
Can this room be off the tour for a while?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.945
- We'll see what we can do.

07:35.945 --> 07:37.561
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:39.605 --> 07:40.523
- First impressions.

07:40.523 --> 07:41.565
It maybe steeped in history

07:41.565 --> 07:43.533
but this room smells like
the room's steeped in piss.

07:43.533 --> 07:46.747
(instrumental music)

07:49.751 --> 07:53.321
- Let me put you in the
presidential Ulysses S. Grant room.

07:53.321 --> 07:54.943
- [Gordon Voiceover] I've
just arrived at Murphy's Hotel

07:54.943 --> 07:56.883
near Sacramento, California.

07:56.883 --> 07:58.801
It's like I'm in a museum.

07:58.801 --> 08:00.303
- We're gonna be on display today.

08:00.303 --> 08:01.314
- Hello.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.497
Thank God, I wasn't in my underpants.

08:03.497 --> 08:04.964
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Time for a bite to eat.

08:04.964 --> 08:07.507
I hope the food here is
less stale than my bedroom.

08:07.507 --> 08:10.548
(orchestral music)

08:11.428 --> 08:13.507
- Murphy's Historic Hotel,
employee of the month.

08:13.507 --> 08:15.279
He looks a happy bunny.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.323
How are you?

08:17.323 --> 08:18.342
- Party of one?

08:18.342 --> 08:19.468
- Party of one?

08:19.468 --> 08:21.146
No party for one.

08:21.146 --> 08:22.015
Good to see you.

08:22.015 --> 08:22.884
- I'm Brian.

08:22.884 --> 08:24.567
- Is that the same?

08:24.567 --> 08:26.391
Congratulations, employee of the month.

08:26.391 --> 08:28.477
- Thank you.
- Do you get a bonus?

08:28.477 --> 08:29.514
Do you get a nice steak?

08:29.514 --> 08:30.778
Do you get a free dinner?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.346
- I'm one of the only employees
that never made the cut yet.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.921
- I see. You just put yourself in

08:34.921 --> 08:36.735
and what are the owners
gonna say about that?

08:36.735 --> 08:37.712
- I'm one of them.

08:37.712 --> 08:39.571
(instrumental music)

08:39.571 --> 08:40.572
I'm Brian.

08:40.572 --> 08:41.441
- Stop it.

08:41.441 --> 08:42.308
- Yes.

08:42.308 --> 08:43.178
- Come on.

08:43.178 --> 08:44.920
- Hey, the other owners
out there to shot on there.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.789
- You're the owner.

08:45.789 --> 08:47.412
And you made yourself
employee of the month?

08:47.412 --> 08:48.281
- Yeah.

08:49.873 --> 08:52.532
- Are you the man with the g-string?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.441
- The g-string?

08:53.441 --> 08:55.785
- The receptionist told
me, do you do lap dancing?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.337
- Oh no. That would probably be Kevin.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.205
- I see.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.074
- I don't know.

08:59.074 --> 09:00.550
My booty is a little too
big to do the lap dancing.

09:00.550 --> 09:01.419
- I was gonna say.

09:01.419 --> 09:03.262
I can't wait to see that one.

09:03.262 --> 09:04.617
I would love to meet the other two,

09:04.617 --> 09:05.660
the chef and the lap dancer.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.528
Are they around?

09:06.528 --> 09:07.397
- You want me to bring them out?

09:07.397 --> 09:08.265
- Yeah.
- All right.

09:08.265 --> 09:09.705
- Kevin and Joel and I,

09:09.705 --> 09:11.947
we're all equal shareholders
in this business.

09:11.947 --> 09:14.283
But it was my plan to buy the hotel.

09:14.283 --> 09:15.152
- Hello.

09:15.152 --> 09:16.020
- Kevin.

09:16.020 --> 09:16.906
- Kevin. Gordon, good to see you, mate.

09:16.906 --> 09:17.775
And this is?

09:17.775 --> 09:18.683
- Hi, Gordon. Joel.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.050
- Joel. So you're the lap dancer?

09:21.050 --> 09:22.749
- Yes, There's might've
been some lap dancing.

09:22.749 --> 09:24.004
- I'm just dying to find out.

09:24.004 --> 09:25.867
- I'm not a professional.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.014
Maybe once in a while.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.028
I'm a wild one when I start drinking

09:30.028 --> 09:32.603
I get a little stripper action going on

09:32.603 --> 09:35.408
or get a little rowdy
and can be the most fun

09:35.408 --> 09:38.227
that any young adult could ever dream of.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.372
- So obviously the chef?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.240
- Yes.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.109
- Restaurant manager.

09:42.109 --> 09:43.562
And the lap dancer.

09:43.562 --> 09:45.095
- Bar manager.
- Bar manager.

09:45.095 --> 09:46.815
So who's in charge?

09:46.815 --> 09:48.400
- All three of us.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.269
- No such thing.

09:50.663 --> 09:51.539
So who was runs the hotel?

09:51.539 --> 09:53.103
Who's in charge of

09:53.103 --> 09:53.972
the hotel?

09:53.972 --> 09:56.063
- Hotel manager job
doesn't really entail much.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.578
(instrumental music)

09:59.578 --> 10:00.447
- With three owners,

10:00.447 --> 10:02.435
normally, there's one that takes the reins

10:02.435 --> 10:03.801
and two others silent.

10:03.801 --> 10:05.939
None of you sound and look like an owner.

10:07.576 --> 10:09.474
- Well, Gordon, thinks
we don't look like owners

10:09.474 --> 10:11.684
but what what's the owner look like?

10:11.684 --> 10:13.957
We bought the hotel nine months ago.

10:13.957 --> 10:15.521
- And you guys go back a long way?

10:15.521 --> 10:17.909
- Just met each other 15 years ago.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.682
- I'm confused whether
it's the Three Musketeers

10:19.682 --> 10:20.777
or the Three Stooges.

10:22.184 --> 10:24.374
Anyway, I'm gonna have
a quick bite to eat.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.230
It's been a long journey.

10:26.230 --> 10:27.116
I'm excited to taste the food.

10:27.116 --> 10:28.012
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

10:28.012 --> 10:28.880
- Thank you.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.036
- Gordon's gonna love our food.

10:30.036 --> 10:32.079
Joel works really hard at
everything he puts out,

10:32.079 --> 10:34.978
everything that comes out the
window is a great product.

10:34.978 --> 10:38.888
- I can't believe this
hotel is owned by three guys

10:38.888 --> 10:39.962
with a pink dining room.

10:39.962 --> 10:40.984
- Pink's the new black.

10:40.984 --> 10:42.647
- Well, it's like a girl's bedroom.

10:42.647 --> 10:44.540
(instrumental music)

10:44.540 --> 10:45.812
Ghastly, ghastly.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.188
Any special on today?

10:47.188 --> 10:51.057
- We have a fresh Alaskan halibut

10:51.057 --> 10:52.037
with a...

10:55.050 --> 10:57.261
Now that I'm talking to you,
I've completely forgotten.

10:57.261 --> 11:00.347
No, we had the halibut with a...

11:00.347 --> 11:02.401
Well, this is the first
time I forget specials.

11:02.401 --> 11:03.830
- Don't worry. Why don't
you check with the chef?

11:03.830 --> 11:04.841
- All right. I will.

11:04.841 --> 11:06.072
- You are the restaurant manager, right?

11:06.072 --> 11:07.667
- Yes. And I'm a server too.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.753
- Restaurant management,
employee of the month and owner.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.087
- Yes, all the above.

11:11.087 --> 11:11.956
- Employee of the month,

11:11.956 --> 11:13.350
I'm gonna take that plaque back.

11:13.350 --> 11:15.321
Can't even remember the specials.

11:15.321 --> 11:16.280
- Hey Joel.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.866
I forgot the specials just now.

11:18.866 --> 11:21.014
- Brian just forgot our specials.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.516
I have seen him do that before.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.094
- The special available tonight

11:25.094 --> 11:27.914
is a Macadamian and crusted halibut.

11:27.914 --> 11:30.933
- Let's try the escargot,
entree's the lamb shank.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.692
And then what's the Calamari dore?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.561
What does dore mean?

11:33.561 --> 11:35.831
- So dore, it's just a calamari steak.

11:35.831 --> 11:37.207
- I'll go for that as well.
- Okay.

11:37.207 --> 11:38.344
- Thank you. I'll keep hold of the menu.

11:38.344 --> 11:39.212
Thank you very much.

11:39.212 --> 11:40.325
- You're welcome.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.029
- Once Gordon has a bite of Joel's food,

11:43.029 --> 11:44.505
it's gonna put a smile
on his face, guaranteed.

11:44.505 --> 11:47.726
(instrumental music)

11:47.726 --> 11:48.595
Thank you.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.711
Here we go, sir.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.653
Escargot in a red wine, garlic sauce.

11:55.653 --> 11:56.730
- Red wine garlic.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.379
Wow.

12:02.576 --> 12:04.370
Absolutely rancid.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.593
Have a little taste.

12:10.699 --> 12:11.588
Nothing's hot.

12:12.618 --> 12:14.192
Yeah. Strange taste.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.714
- That's the first,
actually the first time

12:15.714 --> 12:17.529
in the history that
I've eaten the escargot.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.436
- Oh really?

12:18.436 --> 12:21.282
- And I'm gonna say that I
don't like it in any way.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.151
- No.

12:22.151 --> 12:24.181
- The escargot tasted like a dirty

12:24.181 --> 12:28.143
funky disgusting flip-flop,
if you sauteed a flip-flop.

12:28.143 --> 12:30.907
I think that would be a
good good way describing it.

12:30.907 --> 12:33.096
- That was fucking disgusting.

12:33.096 --> 12:35.663
- I wanna run home and get
some mouthwash for sure.

12:35.663 --> 12:37.027
- You do whatever you need to do.

12:37.027 --> 12:38.195
- All right.

12:38.195 --> 12:39.852
- 'Cause they stink.

12:39.852 --> 12:41.824
(instrumental music)

12:41.824 --> 12:42.940
- Some water for you?

12:42.940 --> 12:44.268
- Please.

12:44.268 --> 12:46.130
- Do you have any little samples

12:46.130 --> 12:48.341
of wine flight, anything original?

12:48.341 --> 12:49.270
- We've talked about that.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.979
But we have not implemented it.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.668
- So you've been talking
about it for nine months

12:52.668 --> 12:53.700
but you haven't actually done it yet.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.526
No one's even bothered the wine flights

12:56.526 --> 12:57.704
or trying to get it together.

12:57.704 --> 12:59.571
So you've got this place almost a year

12:59.571 --> 13:00.596
and you haven't implemented something

13:00.596 --> 13:02.511
that this town thrives on?

13:02.511 --> 13:03.380
- Correct.

13:04.761 --> 13:06.903
- Have you tasted this escargot?

13:06.903 --> 13:07.772
- The escargot? Not really.

13:07.772 --> 13:10.029
Have you eaten, I mean,
you eat here, right?

13:10.029 --> 13:11.363
- Not very often.

13:11.363 --> 13:13.647
- And when was the last
time you guys sat down

13:13.647 --> 13:14.565
and had dinner in the restaurant?

13:14.565 --> 13:16.421
- We've never sat down with
all three of us together.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.289
- Strange, stranger.

13:17.289 --> 13:18.517
I'm getting slightly nervous

13:18.517 --> 13:20.699
that nothing actually gets done here.

13:21.749 --> 13:22.823
Anyway, I'm living in hope.

13:22.823 --> 13:23.824
May I have some more bread?

13:23.824 --> 13:25.378
- For sure.

13:25.378 --> 13:27.567
- I got lamb shank coming right out, bruh.

13:28.735 --> 13:30.227
- Oh my God.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.939
(instrumental music)

13:31.939 --> 13:33.626
Holy crap. What is that?

13:33.626 --> 13:35.211
- This is our lamb shank.

13:35.211 --> 13:37.119
- That's a weird-looking lamb shank.

13:37.119 --> 13:40.229
Visually, it looks like
the biggest plate up puke.

13:41.581 --> 13:44.126
- I've never personally had
lamb shank ever in here.

13:44.126 --> 13:45.249
I do not like lamb.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.899
- You're the restaurant manager.

13:46.899 --> 13:47.768
You don't like lamb.

13:47.768 --> 13:49.461
You don't eat escargot.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.863
- I'm the restaurant manager,
but I'm not the chef.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.893
- I think I would just
call that a dog's dinner.

13:53.893 --> 13:55.741
What a mess?

13:55.741 --> 13:57.048
- I do apologise again.

14:00.110 --> 14:01.643
- I'm totally embarrassed that

14:01.643 --> 14:03.374
our food is S quality.

14:03.374 --> 14:05.126
I've always thought it was better.

14:05.126 --> 14:06.002
- Hey Joel.
- Yeah.

14:06.002 --> 14:06.870
- The lamb shank,

14:06.870 --> 14:09.964
he mentioned that the vegetable gravy goo

14:09.964 --> 14:11.884
was a little too much.

14:11.884 --> 14:12.752
- Okay.

14:12.752 --> 14:13.657
- I'm gonna run this out.

14:13.657 --> 14:15.324
(instrumental music)

14:15.324 --> 14:16.679
- So fine dining;

14:16.679 --> 14:17.548
frozen,

14:17.548 --> 14:18.525
inedible,

14:18.525 --> 14:19.526
nasty,

14:19.526 --> 14:20.394
excrement.

14:20.394 --> 14:21.715
I'm amazed.

14:21.715 --> 14:22.584
What's this one?

14:22.584 --> 14:24.750
- This is the calamari dorÃ© steak.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.533
- That's not garlic in there again, is it?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.836
- There is a garlic in there again.

14:27.836 --> 14:28.705
- Jesus.

14:28.705 --> 14:29.974
- It's just how that dish is prepared.

14:29.974 --> 14:31.955
- Everything's just laced with garlic.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.826
Please

14:34.826 --> 14:35.972
be my guest.

14:38.764 --> 14:39.632
What is it trying to be,

14:39.632 --> 14:40.967
a sponge?

14:44.519 --> 14:45.447
- I'm embarrassed.

14:45.447 --> 14:46.435
I'm chewing on it, going,

14:46.435 --> 14:48.628
"I just want to spit
this shit out right now."

14:48.628 --> 14:50.692
Like, "This is terrible."

14:50.692 --> 14:52.100
So that's the first bite
I've ever taken of that.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.956
- You know this stuff's
on the menu, right?

14:53.956 --> 14:54.825
You're aware of it?

14:54.825 --> 14:55.693
This is your hotel, yes?
- Yes, it is.

14:55.693 --> 14:58.377
- I'm not being punked here
that you guys are the owners.

14:58.377 --> 14:59.246
- We are the owners.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.234
- The owners haven't sent
their sons in to take the heat.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.103
- Nope.

15:02.103 --> 15:02.971
- No, you definitely are the owners.

15:02.971 --> 15:04.328
- This is us.

15:04.328 --> 15:08.241
(instrumental music)

15:08.241 --> 15:11.088
- How do these Three
Stooges qualify to run

15:11.088 --> 15:12.508
an historic hotel like this?

15:12.508 --> 15:14.099
(instrumental music)

15:14.099 --> 15:15.196
- [Gordon's Voiceover] If
they can't even get the food

15:15.196 --> 15:18.022
and wine right, how are they
gonna improve the hotel?

15:18.022 --> 15:20.222
I feel like I'm being looked
after by college kids.

15:20.222 --> 15:21.244
- Do they want me to come out or?

15:21.244 --> 15:22.112
- It'd probably be good.

15:22.112 --> 15:22.981
Yeah, come on out.

15:24.425 --> 15:27.640
(instrumental music)

15:29.437 --> 15:32.015
- So are we very impressed?

15:32.015 --> 15:34.809
- No, far from impressed.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
Have you ever actually stood back

15:36.102 --> 15:37.948
and looked at that lamb shank as a dish

15:37.948 --> 15:41.274
and it's most horrendous, the most drabby,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.373
disgusting looking fucking lamb shank.

15:45.174 --> 15:46.300
Have you given up?

15:46.300 --> 15:47.169
- Nope.

15:47.169 --> 15:48.246
- No, no way. We just started.

15:48.246 --> 15:49.114
We're not giving up yet.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.455
- You just started?
- Yeah.

15:50.455 --> 15:54.058
- Have you ever just
walked in from outside,

15:54.058 --> 15:55.537
checked in, went up to the rooms?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.435
- No.

15:56.435 --> 15:57.304
- You've never done that.
- Never have.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.635
- Have you ever done that?

15:58.635 --> 15:59.504
- No, sir.

15:59.504 --> 16:00.710
- Have you ever done that?
- I have not.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.337
- Oh my God.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.736
What have you improved on since
you bought it, truthfully?

16:05.736 --> 16:07.936
- I make people laugh and smile every day.

16:07.936 --> 16:08.833
- Seriously.

16:08.833 --> 16:09.990
What have you changed?

16:09.990 --> 16:11.898
- Weekends, we serve breakfast all day.

16:11.898 --> 16:14.046
- What have you changed, menu-wise menu?

16:14.046 --> 16:14.915
- Menu... uh.

16:16.668 --> 16:17.690
Fucking hell.

16:17.690 --> 16:20.105
(instrumental music)

16:20.105 --> 16:22.305
I got one, two, three,

16:22.305 --> 16:24.571
three idiots that
haven't changed anything.

16:26.903 --> 16:27.772
You don't stay here.

16:27.772 --> 16:28.640
You don't eat together.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.500
You don't criticise the food.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.409
Shit reception,

16:32.409 --> 16:33.671
shit room,

16:33.671 --> 16:35.443
shit food,

16:35.443 --> 16:36.669
and three clueless owners.

16:36.669 --> 16:38.571
(intense instrumental music)

16:38.571 --> 16:39.822
Owners?

16:39.822 --> 16:41.202
My fucking ass.

16:41.202 --> 16:43.788
(dramatic music)

16:43.788 --> 16:44.707
(instrumental music)

16:44.707 --> 16:46.120
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
staying at Murphy's Hotel

16:46.120 --> 16:47.862
in Northern California.

16:47.862 --> 16:50.844
And after being put on
display for gawking tourists

16:52.397 --> 16:54.180
and eating an atrocious lunch.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.901
- I think I would just
call that a dog's dinner,

16:55.901 --> 16:57.426
what a mess.

16:57.426 --> 16:58.295
- [Gordon Voiceover] I need to see

16:58.295 --> 16:59.918
the three nitwit owners in action.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.075
Word has got out that I'm in Murphy's

17:03.075 --> 17:05.316
and the hotel and restaurant
are full of people.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.967
I feel sorry for all of them.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.058
- Can we get something else?

17:11.058 --> 17:12.866
- What's wrong?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.028
- The ribs are a little too charcoal.

17:15.028 --> 17:16.724
- This is just like vinegar.

17:16.724 --> 17:19.051
- The chicken was really dry.

17:19.051 --> 17:20.634
- [Gordon Voiceover] Joel
is running the kitchen.

17:20.634 --> 17:21.502
- Ribs are burned.

17:21.502 --> 17:22.371
Chicken's burned.

17:22.371 --> 17:24.407
- [Gordon Voiceover] Kevin
is getting busy in the bar.

17:24.407 --> 17:26.633
And Brian is overseeing the dining room.

17:28.330 --> 17:30.303
- There should be geer, nice geer cheese.

17:30.303 --> 17:31.172
- Geer?

17:31.172 --> 17:32.873
- Isn't it geer cheese?

17:32.873 --> 17:34.171
- Gruyere.
- Gruyere, I mean.

17:34.171 --> 17:35.691
(instrumental music)

17:35.691 --> 17:37.276
- [Gordon Voiceover] So
guests trying to check in

17:37.276 --> 17:38.650
are left to fend for themselves.

17:38.650 --> 17:42.156
(instrumental music)

17:42.156 --> 17:44.155
- Do we ask you to check in for the room?

17:44.155 --> 17:45.366
(instrumental music)

17:45.366 --> 17:48.407
(bar room chatter)

17:50.351 --> 17:52.033
- Is everything okay?

17:53.028 --> 17:56.910
- We went up to the front desk
and there was nobody there.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.868
So we're trying to check in the hotel.

18:01.071 --> 18:02.208
- There's one of the owners.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.249
Guests have arrived to check in.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.189
You get Brian urgently or Kevin.

18:05.189 --> 18:06.096
- What about it?

18:06.096 --> 18:07.480
- About our guests checking in.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.380
- Guests checking in, I can do that.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.069
- Would you, please?

18:10.069 --> 18:10.997
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

18:10.997 --> 18:11.865
- Excuse me.

18:11.865 --> 18:13.711
You shouldn't have to come
looking for us in the bar.

18:15.376 --> 18:17.649
So that's what happens
when guests come in late?

18:17.649 --> 18:19.172
They go to the bar looking for...

18:19.172 --> 18:20.944
- Yes, that is how we do it.

18:20.944 --> 18:21.813
- Have you ever done that?

18:21.813 --> 18:23.582
Checked in and then found
the reception closed

18:23.582 --> 18:25.205
and went to the bar looking for a key?

18:25.205 --> 18:28.014
- No, I've actually
always stayed at hotels

18:28.014 --> 18:30.360
probably only a matter of 20
times my whole entire life.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.569
- Wow. And you're a hotel owner?

18:31.569 --> 18:32.438
- Yeah.

18:32.438 --> 18:34.114
- So how come you guys
don't have anybody up here?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.783
- We've got bartenders or servers like me

18:36.783 --> 18:37.857
sometimes taking care of it.

18:37.857 --> 18:39.108
- Wow.

18:39.108 --> 18:41.049
- Just sign the top there, please.

18:41.049 --> 18:42.977
- [Gordon Voiceover] Once
guests get to the rooms,

18:42.977 --> 18:45.243
they're in for another
unpleasant surprise.

18:45.243 --> 18:47.937
(upbeat music)

18:49.775 --> 18:52.070
- (indistinct)

18:52.070 --> 18:54.495
- But they have all the
bar people out there.

18:54.495 --> 18:55.364
Let's see if it still sounds

18:55.364 --> 18:57.044
like the French Quarter out here?

18:57.044 --> 18:59.239
(upbeat music)

18:59.239 --> 19:00.588
Let's wait for the drunkards to go home

19:00.588 --> 19:01.860
before we open that up.

19:03.024 --> 19:06.187
(revellers cheering)

19:06.187 --> 19:08.899
- It's very noisy in there
from the bar in the street.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.559
(instrumental music)

19:10.559 --> 19:11.943
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
owners ignorance is evident

19:11.943 --> 19:13.653
in everything I've seen so far.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.644
I'm curious to see what it's like

19:14.644 --> 19:16.646
in the parts I haven't seen

19:16.646 --> 19:17.933
like the walk-in fridge.

19:17.933 --> 19:21.148
(instrumental music)

19:23.120 --> 19:24.695
- What the fuck are those?

19:24.695 --> 19:25.564
Oof.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.511
Grilled pork, cooked chicken

19:27.511 --> 19:29.012
sat next to each other.

19:29.012 --> 19:30.235
Fucking disgusting.

19:31.165 --> 19:33.819
I wish I'd seen this
before I had my lunch.

19:33.819 --> 19:36.173
Fine dining, it's not.

19:36.173 --> 19:37.295
Look at that bucket.

19:37.295 --> 19:39.359
Look at the mould growing on there.

19:40.488 --> 19:42.227
Dirty fuckers.

19:43.151 --> 19:44.038
Bloody hell.

19:44.038 --> 19:46.247
There's mould at the sides too.

19:46.247 --> 19:47.364
Oh,

19:47.364 --> 19:50.888
Jesus Christ, look at the
fucking mould on that.

19:50.888 --> 19:53.488
This is absolutely disgusting.

19:57.582 --> 19:59.208
Bollocks.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.410
(instrumental music)

20:02.410 --> 20:06.331
So the walk-in, how often
is that fridge cleaned out?

20:06.331 --> 20:07.248
- Twice a week.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.117
- Twice a week?

20:08.117 --> 20:08.986
- Yes.

20:08.986 --> 20:09.970
- Marked,

20:09.970 --> 20:10.838
everything out?

20:10.838 --> 20:12.201
- Yes.
- Yes.

20:12.201 --> 20:15.017
- Come with me, all of
you, especially the owners.

20:15.017 --> 20:16.028
- Sounds good.

20:16.028 --> 20:18.336
- Sounds good? Really? Fucking no.

20:23.066 --> 20:24.289
- Oh wow.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.875
Oh wow.

20:29.510 --> 20:30.918
- Fucking mouldy tortillas.

20:30.918 --> 20:33.514
There should not be fucking
any mouldy fucking food.

20:33.514 --> 20:34.661
It's looking horrible.

20:34.661 --> 20:35.933
- And when was this made?

20:35.933 --> 20:37.226
- Last Saturday.

20:37.226 --> 20:38.095
Three days ago.

20:38.095 --> 20:39.145
- Can you just smell that?
- I need to toss it out.

20:39.145 --> 20:40.013
I know that.

20:41.799 --> 20:42.888
- And this terrible.

20:42.888 --> 20:44.708
You should be fucking ashamed.

20:44.708 --> 20:45.662
- Okay.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.643
- Okay? No, it's not okay.

20:47.643 --> 20:49.301
What is that?

20:49.301 --> 20:50.281
- Black mould.

20:50.281 --> 20:51.824
What's it supposed to be?

20:51.824 --> 20:53.029
- Thai chilli marinade.

20:53.029 --> 20:54.765
- That chilli marinade.

20:54.765 --> 20:56.694
- But I don't if it's
been used in a while.

20:56.694 --> 20:59.446
- The sauces was from a
chef that had been there

20:59.446 --> 21:01.556
in 2006 or seven or something.

21:02.737 --> 21:04.170
- This is exactly the same way

21:04.170 --> 21:07.134
you run this fucking hotel,
you don't give a shit.

21:08.018 --> 21:08.935
- I give a shit.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.863
I give a shit.

21:09.863 --> 21:12.637
- If this is your dream
of running a hotel,

21:12.637 --> 21:16.224
then how about manning up
and look like fucking owners.

21:16.224 --> 21:17.092
- We are.

21:17.092 --> 21:17.961
This is fucking unacceptable.

21:17.961 --> 21:19.758
And it's not gonna happen anymore.

21:19.758 --> 21:20.627
- Have you checked out?

21:20.627 --> 21:22.042
Because you should do
the honourable thing.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.123
Say to these two, fuck it, "I'm out."

21:23.123 --> 21:25.359
- He has not checked out.

21:25.359 --> 21:26.505
- Can you let him talk?

21:26.505 --> 21:27.704
- I have not checked out

21:27.704 --> 21:30.321
and I obviously I need
to pay more attention

21:30.321 --> 21:32.062
and do better at my job.

21:32.062 --> 21:34.002
- How any of you can
run a fucking business?

21:34.002 --> 21:35.628
Do you ever see three CEOs,

21:35.628 --> 21:38.791
three fucking general managers,
three executive chefs?

21:39.977 --> 21:42.302
It's like dumb, dumber and dumbest!

21:43.314 --> 21:46.182
(dramatic music)

21:47.139 --> 21:48.036
(instrumental music)

21:48.036 --> 21:49.455
- [Gordon Voiceover] Since
my arrival in Murphy's Hotel

21:49.455 --> 21:50.612
in Northern California-

21:50.612 --> 21:52.503
- You should be fucking ashamed.

21:52.503 --> 21:53.605
- [Gordon Voiceover] -I've been appalled

21:53.605 --> 21:55.440
by the three clueless owners.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.887
- It's like dumb, dumber and dumbest.

21:59.069 --> 22:02.040
Are you guys really the fucking owners?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.584
- True story.

22:03.584 --> 22:04.452
- Fuck off.

22:05.578 --> 22:09.228
(soft instrumental music)

22:15.481 --> 22:16.993
Unbelievable.

22:16.993 --> 22:20.371
Three young idiots that are
playing at running a hotel.

22:20.371 --> 22:22.731
And not one of them
have got a fucking clue.

22:26.708 --> 22:27.576
(upbeat music)

22:27.576 --> 22:28.445
- I'm mad at Joel.

22:28.445 --> 22:29.745
I'm a fucking owner.

22:29.745 --> 22:31.455
I don't fucking wanna clean.

22:31.455 --> 22:33.711
I've been here 12 hours,
it's unacceptable.

22:36.710 --> 22:38.368
I do wanna prove Gordon Ramsey wrong

22:38.368 --> 22:42.445
about me being a fucking
idiot, fucking dumb and dumber,

22:42.445 --> 22:44.385
fucking scoundrel, wanker,

22:44.385 --> 22:46.178
fucking whatever British
fucking terminology

22:46.178 --> 22:47.628
that fucking wanker has to say

22:47.628 --> 22:49.723
across from the different pond guy.

22:49.723 --> 22:51.503
But I do respect him.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.349
Time to get a drink.

22:53.349 --> 22:58.562
(upbeat music) (bar chatter)

22:59.997 --> 23:00.953
- Mighty B!

23:01.926 --> 23:03.751
Be Mighty.
- Hey guys.

23:05.394 --> 23:06.353
What's up, brother?

23:06.353 --> 23:07.419
- Are you gonna get a shot?

23:07.419 --> 23:08.847
- You guys all know I like to party

23:08.847 --> 23:11.193
But sorry, I need to wind down.

23:11.193 --> 23:13.059
I'm gonna, I'm going to go play
poker in Reno later tonight.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.720
And I'm not gonna sleep.

23:16.031 --> 23:17.647
- Listen to that fucking music.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.860
How on earth is anyone gonna ever get

23:21.860 --> 23:23.142
to sleep in this hotel?

23:23.142 --> 23:24.470
Jesus Christ.

23:25.885 --> 23:26.865
That's crazy.

23:26.865 --> 23:27.956
- You know what?

23:29.088 --> 23:30.942
Frog's Asses for everyone
in this building,

23:30.942 --> 23:31.874
right here, right now.

23:31.874 --> 23:34.412
(revellers applauding)

23:34.412 --> 23:39.625
(instrumental music) (bar chatter)

23:43.526 --> 23:44.778
- How annoying is this?

23:44.778 --> 23:46.231
This doesn't make sense.

23:47.496 --> 23:48.624
(revellers applauding)

23:48.624 --> 23:51.598
- Anyone in here, fuckin' Frog's Ass!

23:51.598 --> 23:56.811
(upbeat music) (revellers cheering)

23:58.699 --> 24:00.149
- Unreal.

24:00.149 --> 24:04.204
There's gotta be a quieter room somewhere.

24:04.204 --> 24:06.276
(indistinct)

24:06.276 --> 24:09.161
(instrumental music)

24:09.161 --> 24:12.173
(revellers applauding)

24:12.173 --> 24:13.785
- Pull it up.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.741
You got it.

24:16.093 --> 24:16.962
- [Reveler] Mighty B!

24:16.962 --> 24:22.115
Let's go. (revellers applauding)

24:22.115 --> 24:23.750
(bar room chatter)

24:23.750 --> 24:25.023
- Rip it off.

24:25.023 --> 24:26.206
Get it, come on.

24:26.206 --> 24:27.967
You wanna see the tattoo?

24:27.967 --> 24:31.270
(revellers applauding)

24:34.231 --> 24:36.577
- One nation, motherfucker.

24:38.993 --> 24:41.095
- Got two seconds, please?

24:41.095 --> 24:42.464
- Oh fuck, here we go.

24:44.703 --> 24:46.549
- Hey, I have a walk-in to clean.

24:46.549 --> 24:47.417
I've been here.

24:47.417 --> 24:48.286
I wanna go get that cleaning

24:48.286 --> 24:50.768
because it's number one right now.

24:50.768 --> 24:52.711
- Is this a joke?

24:52.711 --> 24:53.691
- Is this is a joke?

24:53.691 --> 24:55.704
They're partying and I'm upset.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.102
And we're just, I don't
know they're partying.

24:59.794 --> 25:00.663
- What's happened to your shirt?

25:00.663 --> 25:01.531
Have you been fighting?

25:01.531 --> 25:03.472
- They wanted to see it.

25:03.472 --> 25:04.900
And I was upset earlier

25:04.900 --> 25:06.256
and I'm upset at Joel.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.851
I'm upset at everything that's
going on and I want it...

25:09.394 --> 25:10.263
I'm just upset.

25:10.263 --> 25:13.224
- How about thinking for two
minutes about your guests.

25:14.285 --> 25:15.153
- I wanna go...

25:15.153 --> 25:16.554
I'm gonna go clean the walk-in.

25:16.554 --> 25:17.550
I'm gonna go clean the walk-in.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.435
- You just walk off like that?

25:18.435 --> 25:19.303
- You know what?

25:19.303 --> 25:20.897
I'm gonna go clean the
walk-in because you know why?

25:20.897 --> 25:22.459
- Why are you acting like a fucking jerk?

25:22.459 --> 25:23.606
- Because I'm upset.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.261
That was fucking unacceptable in there.

25:25.261 --> 25:26.130
- What was unacceptable?

25:26.130 --> 25:27.923
- The fucking walk-in with
the fucking with black mole.

25:27.923 --> 25:29.731
- So why don't you do something about it?

25:29.731 --> 25:33.468
- I was... (mumbling)

25:33.468 --> 25:36.336
(dramatic music)

25:40.494 --> 25:42.440
(upbeat music) (bar chatter)

25:42.440 --> 25:43.308
- I'm gonna go clean the walk-in.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.263
- You just walk off by that?

25:44.263 --> 25:45.131
- You know what?

25:45.131 --> 25:46.375
I'm gonna go clean the walk-in.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.244
You know why?

25:47.244 --> 25:48.489
- Why are you acting like a fucking jerk?

25:48.489 --> 25:49.799
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Brian is coming undone

25:49.799 --> 25:51.144
and is drinking on the job.

25:51.144 --> 25:53.188
I'm done trying to get
through to him today.

25:53.188 --> 25:54.137
- I'm upset.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.675
That was fucking unacceptable in there.

25:55.675 --> 25:56.577
- What was unacceptable?

25:56.577 --> 25:57.724
- The fucking walk-in.

25:59.590 --> 26:01.175
- You're drunk.

26:01.175 --> 26:02.114
Go home.

26:02.114 --> 26:02.982
- All right.

26:04.025 --> 26:05.724
I wanna go clean the walk-in now too.

26:05.724 --> 26:06.592
(upbeat music)

26:06.592 --> 26:07.609
I'm gonna do it in a t-shirt.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.088
- Jesus Christ.

26:09.088 --> 26:09.965
- [Gordon Voiceover]
I've been told the hotel

26:09.965 --> 26:12.270
offers modern rooms further from the bar.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.344
So I've asked to be put in one

26:13.344 --> 26:15.620
so I can get away from all this madness.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.913
- Looks like it's not
quiet in here either.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.385
- [Gordon Voiceover] And
they call these modern rooms.

26:23.385 --> 26:26.054
It looks like my grandma's
house from the 1950s.

26:26.054 --> 26:27.180
Look at this wallpaper,

26:27.180 --> 26:28.049
hideous.

26:28.049 --> 26:30.423
- What sort of hotel is this

26:30.423 --> 26:32.108
when you can't get a good night's sleep?

26:32.108 --> 26:34.802
(upbeat music)

26:36.064 --> 26:37.977
This was supposed to be quieter down here.

26:37.977 --> 26:40.670
(upbeat music)

26:43.957 --> 26:45.641
(instrumental music)

26:45.641 --> 26:47.704
- [Gordon Voiceover] What
an awful night's sleep.

26:47.704 --> 26:50.919
(instrumental music)

26:59.452 --> 27:00.850
- Fucking shower is hideous.

27:00.850 --> 27:03.132
The water's freezing.

27:03.132 --> 27:04.696
This place stinks.

27:05.863 --> 27:07.601
Modern room, my ass.

27:08.996 --> 27:10.787
- [Gordon Voiceover]
This place is such a mess

27:10.787 --> 27:12.142
from the awful deco,

27:12.142 --> 27:13.466
to the dreadful food,

27:13.466 --> 27:15.565
to the drunken partying all night long.

27:16.438 --> 27:17.846
I need to get the whole team together

27:17.846 --> 27:21.021
and find out how it's
gotten into this state.

27:21.021 --> 27:22.027
- Morning, guys.

27:22.027 --> 27:22.896
- Good morning.

27:22.896 --> 27:24.180
- Morning.

27:24.180 --> 27:26.594
Could I ask that we have a meeting

27:26.594 --> 27:27.494
with the team?

27:27.494 --> 27:28.362
- Cool.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.093
(instrumental music)

27:33.093 --> 27:34.915
- Man, that was a bad night's sleep.

27:34.915 --> 27:36.823
The noise over here was insane.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.035
I came by downstairs last night

27:38.035 --> 27:40.671
and Brian's ripping his shirt up,

27:40.671 --> 27:43.559
shouting, screaming about,
"Hey, shots all on me."

27:43.559 --> 27:44.904
Is that normal?

27:44.904 --> 27:47.479
Is that really how these managers operate?

27:47.479 --> 27:49.419
- When they're off duty,
they come behind the bar

27:49.419 --> 27:51.807
turn up the juke box when
I've already turned it down,

27:51.807 --> 27:53.089
pour themselves drinks.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.810
- It's their personal frat house.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.574
- How does that make you feel?

27:58.574 --> 28:01.170
Your employees are concerned
that you're drunk in the bar.

28:01.170 --> 28:03.256
- When do I treat you all fucking badly?

28:04.218 --> 28:05.341
- What?

28:05.341 --> 28:06.446
- When it comes to scheduling

28:06.446 --> 28:09.116
how many days that you
guys have asked off for

28:09.116 --> 28:10.617
that you didn't get off?

28:10.617 --> 28:12.223
- It's not what we're asking.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.120
If you're gonna run a hotel,

28:13.120 --> 28:15.132
it's not about having a fucking party.

28:15.132 --> 28:16.363
It's about levels of discipline.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.500
- Well, just so you know,
it's not happening any more.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.263
But I'm not gonna be as
happy sometimes for you guys.

28:22.629 --> 28:24.600
- You are as good as your team.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.851
They represent you.

28:25.851 --> 28:27.457
And based on what I've seen,

28:27.457 --> 28:29.744
I don't think you represent them properly.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.192
You go first, and tell these owners

28:33.192 --> 28:34.641
what they need to hear.

28:34.641 --> 28:37.154
- We lose a lot of
reservations when we don't

28:37.154 --> 28:38.864
have somebody to answer to phone.

28:38.864 --> 28:40.355
When we leave the front desk,

28:40.355 --> 28:41.276
we put the phone in the bar.

28:41.276 --> 28:44.318
- After 8:00 PM, we are the front desk.

28:44.318 --> 28:45.548
We are the bartenders.

28:45.548 --> 28:46.883
- I saw that last night.

28:46.883 --> 28:50.313
- They don't answer the phone
because they don't hear it.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.908
We need online booking.

28:51.908 --> 28:53.848
- You know what that takes
away, online bookings?

28:53.848 --> 28:55.193
As front desk girls you know.

28:55.193 --> 28:56.695
- We're talking about
getting rid of the front desk

28:56.695 --> 28:57.563
and putting a computer there

28:57.563 --> 28:59.694
and we don't have a person
there, self check-in.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.840
- That's fine.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.709
- So how do you feel about that?

29:01.709 --> 29:03.601
- So they complain and
you threaten to fire them?

29:03.601 --> 29:04.470
- Yup.

29:04.470 --> 29:05.339
- No, that's not what it is.

29:05.339 --> 29:06.381
- Yes it is.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.562
You just totally attacked me.

29:09.562 --> 29:10.779
- I'm afraid to express my feelings.

29:10.779 --> 29:12.346
I'm afraid I'm gonna get fired.

29:12.346 --> 29:13.214
- Really?

29:13.214 --> 29:14.535
- Nobody's threatened you with their job.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.404
- Nobody has.

29:15.404 --> 29:17.799
- You never threatened me by being fired?

29:17.799 --> 29:18.717
- I have before.

29:18.717 --> 29:19.978
- Were you drunk?
- Yes.

29:19.978 --> 29:20.938
- You were drunk?
- Mm-hmm.

29:20.938 --> 29:23.930
So that's the message I'm trying to get

29:23.930 --> 29:26.287
through to your thick skulls.

29:26.287 --> 29:29.331
You're threatening
staff whilst inebriated.

29:29.331 --> 29:30.457
This is crazy.

29:30.457 --> 29:31.990
People who deserve to be fired

29:31.990 --> 29:33.513
are these three standing here.

29:33.513 --> 29:35.556
There's no structure.

29:35.556 --> 29:37.736
Somebody needs to step
up and run the business

29:37.736 --> 29:38.976
and everyone else follows suit.

29:38.976 --> 29:40.624
You need one general manager.

29:40.624 --> 29:41.677
That's the issue.

29:41.677 --> 29:43.669
You need to be a leader from the top.

29:43.669 --> 29:44.816
That's one person.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.098
There can be 25 owners.

29:46.098 --> 29:48.402
But there needs to be one general manager.

29:48.402 --> 29:49.768
If something doesn't change

29:49.768 --> 29:51.521
you guys are gonna lose this place.

29:51.521 --> 29:54.836
(upbeat music)

29:54.836 --> 29:58.131
Which one of you is capable of stepping up

29:58.131 --> 29:59.328
and running this business?

29:59.328 --> 30:02.195
(dramatic music)

30:07.816 --> 30:08.902
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm at Murphy's Hotel

30:08.902 --> 30:10.508
in Northern California.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.377
- You're the owner.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.958
And you made yourself
employee of the month.

30:12.958 --> 30:13.830
- Yeah.

30:13.830 --> 30:14.699
- [Gordon Voiceover] The place is a mess

30:14.699 --> 30:17.254
because these three owners
behave like frat boys.

30:17.254 --> 30:18.857
- Cheers, boys and girls.

30:18.857 --> 30:20.862
- [Gordon Voiceover] And
none of them is a leader.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.093
- You checked out.

30:22.093 --> 30:23.302
- [Gordon Voiceover]
So the staff don't know

30:23.302 --> 30:24.272
which way to turn.

30:24.272 --> 30:25.794
- I'm afraid to express my feelings.

30:25.794 --> 30:26.917
I'm afraid I'm gonna get fired.

30:26.917 --> 30:29.367
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Things have got to change.

30:30.288 --> 30:32.165
- There needs to be one general manager.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.831
Somebody needs to take charge.

30:33.831 --> 30:36.525
(upbeat music)

30:41.094 --> 30:41.962
- I'm gonna take charge.

30:41.962 --> 30:43.061
I'm gonna run the business.

30:43.061 --> 30:44.177
I'm gonna lead it.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.836
Out of us three, it's
gonna be me, guaranteed.

30:46.836 --> 30:49.672
- If you're gonna run the
hotel, you run the hotel.

30:49.672 --> 30:50.975
- Yup, 100%

30:50.975 --> 30:54.083
- So Kevin and Joel, are you
willing to give him the support

30:54.083 --> 30:56.377
and the autonomy to
actually run this place?

30:57.267 --> 30:58.136
- Yes.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.454
- Yes.

31:00.454 --> 31:04.207
- Brian, it's your responsibility
now to general manage

31:04.207 --> 31:06.720
and absolutely tow the line.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.399
But there are three rules.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.672
Rule number one, stop
drinking on the floor.

31:10.672 --> 31:11.725
- Gotcha.

31:11.725 --> 31:14.864
- Rule number two, you have
to stop working the floor.

31:14.864 --> 31:18.680
And rule number three, you
have to fucking grow some,

31:18.680 --> 31:19.549
fast.

31:20.974 --> 31:24.415
- Brian does know the most
out of the three of them.

31:24.415 --> 31:29.201
So I really do think if he
could stop his partying ways,

31:29.201 --> 31:30.327
he can really do it.

31:30.327 --> 31:31.196
- Trust me.

31:31.196 --> 31:33.382
If you don't grow up now, you never will.

31:33.382 --> 31:34.251
- I got it.

31:34.251 --> 31:36.292
- It's a hotel, not a frat house.

31:36.292 --> 31:39.993
- I'm not gonna be drinking
and I'm gonna be owner.

31:39.993 --> 31:41.938
- Thank God for that.

31:41.938 --> 31:43.015
- Thank you.

31:43.015 --> 31:44.706
- Thank you.

31:44.706 --> 31:45.697
- I'm going to change.

31:45.697 --> 31:47.292
- I'm gonna be more of an owner

31:47.292 --> 31:50.212
and not a friend/coworker.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.478
I know you're gonna see a different Brian.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.348
(instrumental music)

31:55.348 --> 31:56.708
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
future of this historic

31:56.708 --> 31:59.377
national landmark is now in Brian's hands.

31:59.377 --> 32:02.630
And I need to know that he
cares enough to be responsible.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.832
- You are young,
ambitious, slightly naive.

32:05.832 --> 32:08.219
You're going at it in
totally the wrong way.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.082
You're on the verge of
losing this business.

32:10.082 --> 32:11.483
- Hopefully not.

32:11.483 --> 32:13.663
- And how would you feel
if you lost the business?

32:13.663 --> 32:14.932
- It would be horrible.

32:14.932 --> 32:17.009
It would be horrible
because that's already

32:17.009 --> 32:19.574
three years of 60 hour weeks.

32:19.574 --> 32:21.055
It's horrible.

32:21.055 --> 32:21.994
- I'm here to help

32:23.036 --> 32:25.904
but I want you to understand
the mess you're in.

32:25.904 --> 32:26.772
It's not good.

32:26.772 --> 32:27.641
- All right.

32:28.521 --> 32:30.502
- Do you understand?
- I do.

32:30.502 --> 32:31.792
- Deep down inside, there's
no two ways about it.

32:31.792 --> 32:33.455
You're a fun guy.

32:33.455 --> 32:35.528
You have a lot to offer.

32:35.528 --> 32:39.491
But just stop being irresponsible.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.360
- I will.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.097
- And just man up.

32:42.097 --> 32:42.966
- Yeah, for sure.

32:42.966 --> 32:44.255
- And you can do it.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.788
- Okay.

32:45.788 --> 32:47.092
- I wanna make this work.

32:48.563 --> 32:52.701
(soft instrumental music)

32:52.701 --> 32:55.861
- From today on it's gonna
be a changed business,

32:55.861 --> 32:56.886
all right?
- Okay.

32:58.103 --> 33:00.254
Good to see that smile back of your face.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.151
Thank you.

33:02.151 --> 33:03.020
I'll see you later.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.422
- From this day forward, I'm a changed man

33:05.422 --> 33:08.293
and the business is going to
reflect all those changes.

33:09.885 --> 33:11.470
- [Gordon Voiceover] With
Brian, ready to take charge

33:11.470 --> 33:13.439
as general manager, my
design team has worked

33:13.439 --> 33:16.423
all night to modernise Murphy's Hotel.

33:16.423 --> 33:19.384
And now it's time to
reveal the new look hotel

33:19.384 --> 33:20.761
to Brian and his team.

33:20.761 --> 33:22.002
(instrumental music)

33:22.002 --> 33:22.870
- Brian, how are you, sir?

33:22.870 --> 33:24.309
- Gordon, good. How you doing?

33:24.309 --> 33:25.345
- You look very smart.

33:25.345 --> 33:26.214
You're good?

33:26.214 --> 33:27.083
- You're doing good?

33:27.083 --> 33:27.951
- Ladies, how are we?

33:27.951 --> 33:28.836
- I'm great.

33:28.836 --> 33:29.705
- Excited.

33:30.625 --> 33:33.419
- Welcome everyone, to
the new and improved

33:33.419 --> 33:35.202
Murphy's historic hotel.

33:35.202 --> 33:36.099
Are you ready?

33:36.099 --> 33:37.235
- Yes.

33:37.235 --> 33:38.903
- Let's do this.

33:38.903 --> 33:40.708
(upbeat music)

33:40.708 --> 33:43.621
- Welcome to the new lobby.

33:43.621 --> 33:44.680
- No way, this is awesome.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.849
Exactly how it should be.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.224
(talking all at once)

33:48.224 --> 33:49.092
- [Gordon Voiceover]
When I first I walked in,

33:49.092 --> 33:49.961
I was disappointed.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.031
It was just a big anticlimax.

33:51.031 --> 33:53.272
- You have a nice warm, modern

33:53.272 --> 33:54.565
feel when you walk in.

33:54.565 --> 33:58.757
Your guests will arrive and feel welcomed.

33:58.757 --> 33:59.626
Take a seat.

34:00.505 --> 34:01.712
- Like the visual?
- Yes.

34:01.712 --> 34:02.803
Amazing.

34:02.803 --> 34:03.671
Brian, what'd you think?

34:03.671 --> 34:04.836
- Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

34:04.836 --> 34:05.705
Welcoming.

34:05.705 --> 34:07.547
- The colours, the contrast,
the warmth, perfect.

34:07.547 --> 34:10.507
What Gordon has done with
the lobby is beautiful.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.469
Now that blue, it's so warm.

34:12.469 --> 34:13.337
It's so welcoming.

34:13.337 --> 34:14.206
It's awesome.

34:14.206 --> 34:15.795
- This is an historic hotel.

34:15.795 --> 34:17.745
Your ex president stayed here.

34:17.745 --> 34:20.581
That doesn't happen that often in hotels.

34:20.581 --> 34:22.985
- Thank you very much.
- You happy?

34:22.985 --> 34:24.719
- Thank you, bro.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.009
- Hold on, there's more.

34:26.009 --> 34:26.878
- There's more?

34:26.878 --> 34:28.650
- From six o'clock this morning,

34:28.650 --> 34:30.760
you're now live with online bookings.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.042
(staff applauding)

34:34.042 --> 34:35.554
They don't go anywhere near the bar.

34:35.554 --> 34:36.685
You know what time they're coming.

34:36.685 --> 34:37.973
And

34:37.973 --> 34:39.068
you are now

34:39.068 --> 34:40.716
in the 21st century.

34:40.716 --> 34:42.498
Are you ready to see
the presidential suites?

34:42.498 --> 34:43.367
Yeah?

34:44.391 --> 34:45.261
Come and see my room.

34:45.261 --> 34:46.129
Let's go.

34:46.129 --> 34:47.670
(orchestral music)

34:47.670 --> 34:48.539
I think you'll love it.

34:48.539 --> 34:49.408
Let's go.

34:49.408 --> 34:50.409
Jump in.

34:50.409 --> 34:51.277
- Oh my gosh.

34:51.277 --> 34:52.147
It's awesome.

34:52.147 --> 34:56.063
(all talking at once)

34:56.063 --> 34:57.117
- This one's being freshened up.

34:57.117 --> 34:58.396
This one's been spruced up.

34:58.396 --> 35:00.298
You need that vibrance

35:00.298 --> 35:01.174
The minute you walk into a room.

35:01.174 --> 35:02.891
You wanna feel, "Wow, I'm
stepping into history,

35:02.891 --> 35:04.698
"but I also want some comfort."

35:04.698 --> 35:05.960
- This is fit for a president.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.566
Our president now could stay here.

35:08.566 --> 35:11.976
Obama would be the okay to stay here now.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.394
- It still feels historic,

35:13.394 --> 35:14.937
but it's a bedroom, not a museum.

35:14.937 --> 35:15.806
- Exactly.

35:15.806 --> 35:19.035
- So make sure that when
your guests are checked in

35:19.035 --> 35:21.392
their bedrooms are off the tour.

35:21.392 --> 35:22.633
- Did you put new robes?

35:22.633 --> 35:24.012
Is there something on
here to make it softer?

35:24.012 --> 35:25.942
- That's what lined in cushion
that makes the difference.

35:25.942 --> 35:27.697
(talking at once)

35:27.697 --> 35:30.682
- For me, the big problem
wasn't the linens.

35:30.682 --> 35:31.551
It was the noise.

35:31.551 --> 35:33.800
- We've come up with a
solution to narrow that down.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.364
Last call, midnight.

35:35.364 --> 35:38.523
- Well, stick to those
times of your bar closing

35:38.523 --> 35:39.764
because the damage you can do

35:39.764 --> 35:41.926
to your reputation is devastating.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.188
- We're gonna follow through

35:44.188 --> 35:46.354
and make sure that our
customers in the hotel

35:46.354 --> 35:48.064
are as happy as our customers in the bar

35:48.064 --> 35:49.691
and our customers in the restaurant.

35:49.691 --> 35:51.943
- So are you ready see the rooms outside

35:51.943 --> 35:53.556
that you told me were modern?

35:53.556 --> 35:55.895
(laughter)

35:55.895 --> 35:57.949
Let me show you what modern is.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.654
You ready?

35:59.654 --> 36:00.920
(instrumental music)

36:00.920 --> 36:01.788
- I love this one.

36:01.788 --> 36:04.034
- Oh my gosh! I love this one.

36:04.034 --> 36:05.348
- No way.

36:05.348 --> 36:06.499
- Look at the colour.

36:06.499 --> 36:07.622
(all talking at once)

36:07.622 --> 36:09.367
- You can see why I got upset.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.442
The owner's done nothing in nine months.

36:11.442 --> 36:12.908
We've done all this in fucking 24 hours.

36:12.908 --> 36:14.914
(laughter)

36:14.914 --> 36:15.783
- Blown away.

36:15.783 --> 36:18.751
I can't believe the
creativity that's been put

36:18.751 --> 36:20.774
into this place in the last few days.

36:20.774 --> 36:22.244
- Joel, what do you think?

36:22.244 --> 36:23.662
- Last word is inspired.

36:23.662 --> 36:24.828
Very inspiring.

36:24.828 --> 36:28.657
- Listen, you should never,
ever, ever be afraid of change.

36:28.657 --> 36:30.732
You've got to keep on going, every time.

36:30.732 --> 36:31.600
Brian, what do you think?

36:31.600 --> 36:32.469
What's going through your mind?

36:32.469 --> 36:33.338
I have never heard you so quiet.

36:33.338 --> 36:34.206
- Breathtaking

36:34.206 --> 36:35.075
I don't really know what to say

36:35.075 --> 36:35.943
because it's beautiful.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.061
Is there something-
- It's beautiful.

36:37.061 --> 36:37.930
This is perfect.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.261
With this kick in the ass,

36:39.261 --> 36:41.180
we're gonna go forward, full throttle

36:41.180 --> 36:43.359
and make changes that no
one's ever seen before.

36:43.359 --> 36:44.715
- You're ready to see the dining room?

36:44.715 --> 36:46.082
- [All] Yes.

36:46.082 --> 36:46.950
- This one I love.

36:46.950 --> 36:47.822
- The dining room also.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.169
Where do you stop, buddy?

36:51.169 --> 36:53.046
- Look at the colours, come in.

36:53.046 --> 36:53.914
Beautiful.

36:53.914 --> 36:54.783
Where's the pink?

36:54.783 --> 36:55.856
- Oh my God.

36:55.856 --> 36:57.039
- Yeah.

36:57.039 --> 37:00.168
- Gone are those horrendous pink walls.

37:00.168 --> 37:03.588
A stunning beautiful colour
on the walls that just pop.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.019
And there's one more thing,

37:05.934 --> 37:07.581
this bit you're gonna love.

37:07.581 --> 37:08.791
It's a surprise

37:08.791 --> 37:11.283
that's gonna completely
change your business.

37:11.283 --> 37:12.151
You ready for this?

37:12.151 --> 37:14.523
- Yes, let's see it.

37:14.523 --> 37:17.362
(dramatic music)

37:17.362 --> 37:19.661
(upbeat music)

37:19.661 --> 37:20.530
- [Gordon Voiceover] I've just revealed

37:20.530 --> 37:21.898
the stunning new improvements

37:21.898 --> 37:23.556
to the historic Murphy's Hotel.

37:23.556 --> 37:24.424
- Oh my God.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.377
- Our president now could stay here.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.167
- [Gordon Voiceover] And now,
there's one more addition

37:31.167 --> 37:33.931
that will ensure this hotel
thrives in the future.

37:33.931 --> 37:36.006
- You are in the heart of some

37:36.006 --> 37:38.352
of the most sought after
wineries anywhere in the world.

37:38.352 --> 37:39.519
And there's a massive market

37:39.519 --> 37:40.812
that you have been missing out on.

37:40.812 --> 37:41.782
And here's why.

37:41.782 --> 37:44.587
Every famous winery has
a lovely tasting room

37:44.587 --> 37:45.932
on this main street.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.934
At five o'clock, they close.

37:47.934 --> 37:50.603
Here, you're now gonna
pick up that business.

37:50.603 --> 37:53.971
This is a menu designed to
pair with great local wines.

37:53.971 --> 37:56.431
- Oh wow, look at this.

37:56.431 --> 37:57.996
- This is incredible.

37:57.996 --> 37:59.790
- Start off with that lovely cheese plate.

37:59.790 --> 38:01.114
The chicken liver crostini

38:01.114 --> 38:03.147
paired with a stunning chilled Rose.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.170
And then this wonderful

38:05.170 --> 38:07.120
local ricotta dip.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.143
You now have a perfect menu.

38:09.143 --> 38:11.145
When those tasting rooms
close at five o'clock,

38:11.145 --> 38:12.917
you pick it up and you continue it.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.518
And where are they gonna stay tonight?

38:14.518 --> 38:15.387
- [All] Here.

38:15.387 --> 38:16.255
- That's right.

38:16.255 --> 38:17.124
After dinner.

38:17.124 --> 38:19.038
I want you to dig in and sample.

38:19.038 --> 38:20.508
- The wine tasting menu is awesome.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.083
The overall experience to any guest

38:22.083 --> 38:23.063
that walks through our door now,

38:23.063 --> 38:24.408
I believe is gonna be better than ever.

38:24.408 --> 38:26.212
- I like the pairing of the ricotta

38:26.212 --> 38:28.391
and the wine that it goes with.

38:28.391 --> 38:29.987
There's a very nice, fresh dish.

38:29.987 --> 38:30.855
- There's no going back.

38:30.855 --> 38:31.724
- No.

38:31.724 --> 38:33.761
- We're only going up now.

38:33.761 --> 38:34.776
- Oh, that's nice.

38:35.676 --> 38:37.223
This is so phenomenal.

38:37.223 --> 38:40.122
This is gonna put us on the map,

38:40.122 --> 38:43.417
off the charts, reservations off the hook.

38:43.417 --> 38:44.354
- Thank you, chef.

38:44.354 --> 38:45.223
- Thank you.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.618
As well as a wine pairing menu,

38:46.618 --> 38:49.037
I've changed the entire
menu in the dining room.

38:49.037 --> 38:51.281
Let me show you one of
my favourite dishes.

38:51.281 --> 38:52.926
- I'm very excited about the new menu.

38:52.926 --> 38:55.231
- I know where I'm eating every night.

38:55.231 --> 38:56.099
- Oh my God.

38:56.099 --> 38:57.632
- Fresh baked lemon meringue pie.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.170
- Oh my goodness, look at that thing.

39:00.170 --> 39:05.020
- And the real the inspiration
behind this was Brian's hair.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.171
(laughter)

39:08.171 --> 39:09.943
- And where's Bart Simpson?

39:09.943 --> 39:11.445
- This new menu is gonna touch a business

39:11.445 --> 39:14.302
a clientele that we've never
had at the Murphy's Hotel.

39:14.302 --> 39:17.430
And I know personally, I can't
wait to eat there more often.

39:18.494 --> 39:19.922
- [Gordon Voiceover] With
warm and fresh rooms,

39:19.922 --> 39:21.298
and the new wine tasting menu,

39:21.298 --> 39:22.789
my only concern is whether Brian

39:22.789 --> 39:25.448
can stay focused on the guest experience.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.592
- Now, listen every night from now on

39:26.592 --> 39:28.243
in this hotel, is a big night.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.111
Let me tell you.

39:29.111 --> 39:30.116
And it's not just about the bar,

39:30.116 --> 39:31.663
but the restaurant and the rooms.

39:31.663 --> 39:34.124
Push those tasting menus in our bar.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.239
GM, are you ready?

39:35.239 --> 39:36.188
- We're ready.

39:36.188 --> 39:38.013
- If there's one thing you do not need

39:38.013 --> 39:39.170
as a general manager is an apron.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.039
Get that off.

39:40.039 --> 39:42.385
- All right. (laughter)

39:43.946 --> 39:44.850
- Good luck, guys.

39:44.850 --> 39:45.719
- [All] Thank you.

39:45.719 --> 39:46.587
- Are we ready?

39:46.587 --> 39:47.456
- Yeah.

39:47.456 --> 39:48.324
- Let's do this.

39:48.324 --> 39:49.193
- Let's go, guys.

39:49.193 --> 39:50.951
(staff applauding)

39:50.951 --> 39:54.078
(instrumental music)

39:54.078 --> 39:55.551
- Hello. How are you doing?

39:55.551 --> 39:56.420
- Good, how are you.

39:56.420 --> 39:57.345
- [Gordon Voiceover]
With extended front desk

39:57.345 --> 39:59.733
operating hours, guests
can easily check in

39:59.733 --> 40:01.640
and feel welcome in the new lobby.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.549
(soft instrumental music)

40:03.549 --> 40:05.374
- Wow, looks nice.

40:05.374 --> 40:06.723
- I'll bet it'd be a
comfortable sleep tonight.

40:06.723 --> 40:08.326
- It's gonna be fun.

40:08.326 --> 40:09.194
- [Gordon Voiceover] And they're enjoying

40:09.194 --> 40:10.963
the renovated and peaceful rooms.

40:10.963 --> 40:12.933
- I wish this was my bedroom.

40:12.933 --> 40:13.983
- This Newsome Harlow.

40:13.983 --> 40:16.551
- [Gordon Voiceover] And the
wine tasting menu is a hit.

40:16.551 --> 40:17.782
- That food looks lovely.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.137
Guys, they're loving
the food. Keep it going.

40:19.137 --> 40:20.041
- Thank you.

40:20.041 --> 40:20.910
- Yes. Well done.

40:20.910 --> 40:21.779
And good luck.

40:23.996 --> 40:24.865
When I first arrived,

40:24.865 --> 40:28.511
you saw three young guys
playing at running a bar

40:28.511 --> 40:30.764
and completely forgetting
that they were actually

40:30.764 --> 40:32.547
in charge of a hotel.

40:32.547 --> 40:33.415
But

40:33.415 --> 40:36.332
Brian stepped up and has taken
that general manager role,

40:36.332 --> 40:37.541
which is great news.

40:37.541 --> 40:41.243
I'm hoping now that they get
that party mode out of mind

40:41.243 --> 40:42.505
and focus on the potential

40:42.505 --> 40:44.179
of what this business can bring them.

40:44.179 --> 40:47.801
(instrumental music)

40:47.801 --> 40:49.115
Great job.

40:49.115 --> 40:50.815
You performed like owners tonight.

40:50.815 --> 40:51.781
You sound like owners

40:51.781 --> 40:53.922
and this place is rocking.

40:53.922 --> 40:56.237
The atmosphere in the bar is controlled.

40:56.237 --> 40:57.106
The dining room is having fun.

40:57.106 --> 40:57.974
The patio is full.

40:57.974 --> 40:59.438
The wine tasting menu is flying out.

40:59.438 --> 41:00.523
Keep up the good work.

41:00.523 --> 41:02.858
- Gordon, he really has opened my eyes

41:02.858 --> 41:04.693
and showed me that we need to take

41:04.693 --> 41:06.946
more of a leadership role as an owner.

41:06.946 --> 41:08.395
- I'm taking you out to
the employee of the month.

41:08.395 --> 41:09.264
- I know.

41:09.264 --> 41:10.132
- Choose one together.

41:10.132 --> 41:11.001
- Yes, we will.

41:11.001 --> 41:11.869
- On a monthly basis.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.692
Have your input, throw into the pot.

41:13.692 --> 41:15.256
- I believe Gordon has saved this place

41:15.256 --> 41:16.914
by putting wind in our sails again.

41:16.914 --> 41:18.707
We truly did need a kick in the ass

41:18.707 --> 41:20.939
because we were playing
around a little too much.

41:20.939 --> 41:24.474
- General manager, remember
actions speak louder than words.

41:24.474 --> 41:26.544
- Next day, you'll hear
great things, I guarantee.

41:26.544 --> 41:27.977
- Gordon is amazing.

41:27.977 --> 41:28.846
He's a magician.

41:28.846 --> 41:30.094
And I think that he came through

41:30.094 --> 41:31.825
and he transformed the hotel

41:31.825 --> 41:33.775
into this wonderful masterpiece.

41:33.775 --> 41:35.863
And I'm so thankful that he
came through and helped us.

41:35.863 --> 41:37.500
- What a gorgeous place.

41:39.336 --> 41:40.205
Damn,

41:41.563 --> 41:45.255
I never did get to see Kevin
lap dance. (Gordon laughs)

41:45.255 --> 41:48.557
(instrumental music)

41:49.495 --> 41:50.364
- [Gordon Voiceover] Since my visit

41:50.364 --> 41:51.866
to the historic Murphy's hotel,

41:51.866 --> 41:54.389
the owners have finally become owners.

41:54.389 --> 41:57.642
Joel is keeping the kitchen
and the walk-in extra clean

41:57.642 --> 41:59.696
and he has new pride in his work.

41:59.696 --> 42:01.747
- I got a well done going right there.

42:01.747 --> 42:04.525
- You can go peek at
the upstairs bathrooms,

42:04.525 --> 42:07.315
one's down the hall, showers,
both restrooms upstairs.

42:07.315 --> 42:08.538
You stay there.

42:08.538 --> 42:09.677
I'm good right here.

42:09.677 --> 42:12.011
- [Gordon Voiceover] Brian is
stepping up as general manager

42:12.011 --> 42:14.565
focusing his efforts on the hotel.

42:14.565 --> 42:17.527
- Brian is definitely capable
of being the general manager.

42:17.527 --> 42:20.449
Gordon has completely changed everything.

42:22.167 --> 42:25.459
- Gordon brought the
historic hotel back to life.

42:25.459 --> 42:28.761
