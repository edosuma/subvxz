WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:08.132
( theme music playing )

01:52.240 --> 01:54.800
Woman:
I HOPE EVERYBODY
SAVED ROOM FOR DESSERT.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.878
( laughs )

02:07.890 --> 02:10.222
HOW COME UNCLE DANNY
DOESN'T LIKE CLEAN PEACHES?

02:10.330 --> 02:13.822
"CLING" PEACHES,
NOT CLEAN.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.557
AS IN CLINGSTONE.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.821
AND WHO SAYS UNCLE DANNY
DOESN'T LIKE CLING PEACHES?

02:17.930 --> 02:20.398
UNCLE DANNY LOVES
CLING PEACHES, HE JUST
CAN'T HAVE ANY.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.866
WHY CAN'T HE
HAVE ANY?

02:22.970 --> 02:24.858
BECAUSE HE HAS
THE DIABETES.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.938
Man:
HIT ME. HIT ME AGAIN.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.838
Woman:
WE USED TO HAVE THAT PLUM TREE
IN THE BACKYARD.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.941
+
- YOU GOT 16, YOU SHOULD HOLD.

02:32.050 --> 02:35.076
- IT WAS NECTARINES.
- DON'T TELL ME WHEN
TO HOLD. HIT ME.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.842
Woman:
YOU SURE IT WAS NECTARINES?
I THOUGHT IT WAS PLUMS.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.316
Woman 2:
FIRST THING THAT GOES
IS THE MEMORY.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.878
- Woman: ARGH! MMM!
- (water running )

02:43.990 --> 02:46.857
- ( laughter on television )
- Woman: I MADE HAM
FOR CHRISTMAS.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.053
SHE DOESN'T LIKE HAM.
I MADE HER A CAPON,

02:49.160 --> 02:52.232
BUT SHE STILL DIDN'T LIKE
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS
EATING HAM.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.160
Woman 2:
THAT'S SO LIKE HER.

02:54.270 --> 02:56.909
WHEN HER DAUGHTER GOT
A TA'I'I'OO SHE SAID, "I DON'T
HAVE A DAUGHTER."

02:57.010 --> 02:58.932
I REMEMBER!

02:59.040 --> 03:01.907
HOW CAN ANYONE SAY THAT,
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER?

03:02.010 --> 03:04.046
SHE'S SO VINDICT IVE.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.243
NOTHING WAS EVER
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.614
Woman:
IT WAS SO SWEET.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.745
- Woman 2: SHE'S A BIG GIRL.
- NO, SHE GOT HER
STOMACH STAPLED.

03:10.850 --> 03:13.387
- SHE DID THAT?
- YEAH, SHE LOST
ALMOST 200 LBS.!

03:13.490 --> 03:15.617
- NO KIDDING?
- YEAH, SHE GOT MARRIED.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.927
- SHE DID?
- SHE MARRIED A FOOT DOCTOR.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.555
- SHE WAS SO SWEET.
- YEAH, AND THEN SHE MARRIED
A FOOT DOCTOR.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.696
- I WENT TO THE FOOT DOCTOR.
- FOR YOUR CORNS?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.722
FOR MY BONE SPUR.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.560
- YOU HAD A BONE SPUR?
- PAINFUL LIKE YOU WOULD NOT
BELIEVE.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.207
- DID YOU GET THE SURGERY?
- THEY DID.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.631
DOCTORS!
WHAT THEY CAN'T DO TODAY.

03:32.740 --> 03:36.449
STAPLE YOUR STOMACH,
SHAVE OFF A BONE SPUR.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.687
( water running )

04:26.300 --> 04:28.097
THAT WAS...

04:28.200 --> 04:29.462
THAT WAS LOVELY.

04:29.570 --> 04:33.392
- WASN'T IT?
- MM-HM.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.434
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS
HAS BEEN ON YOU.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.203
I KNOW YOU.
I WANT TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU.

04:45.310 --> 04:46.709
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ANYTHING UP TO ME.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.983
I WAN NA TRY TO CLOSE
THIS DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.957
WHAT DISTANCE?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.948
I THINK WE SHOULD TRAVEL.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.459
TRAVEL?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.393
GEORGE, YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT WELL.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.695
NO, I'M FEELING
MUCH MUCH BETTER.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.224
WHERE ON EARTH
WOULD WE TRAVEL TO?

05:05.330 --> 05:07.230
ANYWHERE WE WANTED TO.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.208
ANYWHERE THE WIND
BLOWS US.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.904
COULD WE TALK ABOUT IT
ANOTHER TIME?

05:15.380 --> 05:18.099
YEAH, SURE.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.747
OF COURSE.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.399
( humming )

05:36.530 --> 05:39.533
- ( food spills )
- UH-OH.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.203
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT INVITING MAGGIE
OVER SOME TIME.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.801
- WHAT FOR?
- SHE'S NEW IN TOWN.

05:46.910 --> 05:50.607
SHE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW ANYBODY,
EXCEPT FOR GEORGE AND MY MOTHER.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.541
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK YOU'D LIKE HER.

05:52.650 --> 05:56.381
- OKAY.
- I NEED TO GO PO'I'I'Y.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.947
OH, WELL,
I AM RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE,

05:59.050 --> 06:01.587
SO MOMMY WILL
TAKE YOU, OKAY?

06:03.790 --> 06:06.827
MAYA, DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR OTHER MOMMY?

06:09.300 --> 06:10.426
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.395
JUST ASKING HER
AN HONEST QUESTION.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.968
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE'RE HONEST
WITH HER,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.800
THAT SHE GROWS UP WITH
A COHERENT NARRATIVE,

06:17.910 --> 06:20.629
THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS
WHERE SHE CAME FROM,

06:20.740 --> 06:23.379
AND... HOW I CAME
INTO THE PICTURE.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.869
I AM ALL FOR HER GROWING UP
WITH A COHERENT NARRATIVE,

06:25.980 --> 06:28.210
BUT I THINK THAT WE
HAVE TO PICK THE RIGHT TIME

06:28.320 --> 06:30.447
TO START TELLING
THIS PARTICULAR STORY.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.859
I MEAN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.655
I NEED TO GO PO'I'I'Y!

06:34.760 --> 06:37.126
WHAT BE'I'I'ER TIME
THAN THE PRESENT?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.619
WELL, HOW ABOUT
AFI'ER SHE MAKES PO'I'I'Y,
FOR STARTERS?

06:39.730 --> 06:43.518
OKAY.
COME ON, MOMMY IS GONNA
TAKE YOU TO MAKE POTI'Y.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.729
SHOULD WE CALL MARY?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.774
NO, WE DON'T WANNA
PRESSURE HER.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.677
PRESSURE?
WE JUST INSEMINATED HER.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.010
HAS SHE TRIED
TO CALL YOU?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.418
YOU INSEMINATED HER,
OKAY?

07:04.520 --> 07:06.488
WELL, NOT PERSONALLY
I DIDN'T.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.410
HAS SHE TRIED TO CALL YOU
ON YOUR CELL PHONE?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.852
KEITH, RELAX.
I'M SURE IF SHE
WAS PREGNANT,

07:10.960 --> 07:13.827
WE'D BE
THE FIRST PEOPLE
SHE CALLED.

07:16.900 --> 07:21.030
- I'M NOT SURE
I WANNA DO THIS.
- DO WHAT?

07:22.300 --> 07:24.507
GO TO THIS ADOPTION FAIR.

07:25.810 --> 07:28.131
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT
A FAIR, IT'S A PICNIC.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.140
SECOND OF ALL,
WE HAVE TO.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.378
SISSY PASQUESE
WENT THROUGH A LOT OF TROUBLE
TO GET US MOVED UP THE LIST.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.313
IT JUST...
IT SEEMS WEIRD.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.342
WEIRD HOW?

07:38.450 --> 07:41.351
LIKE WE'RE... GOING
TO LOOK AT PUPPIES.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.758
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LOOK AT PUPPIES.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.851
WE DON'T KNOW IF MARY
IS EVEN PREGNANT,

07:45.960 --> 07:47.757
OR EVER WILL GET
PREGNANT.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.328
BESIDES, WE ALWAYS AGREED
WE'D KEEP MOVING FORWARD

07:50.430 --> 07:52.569
ON BOTH PRONGS
OF THE TWO-PRONGED APPROACH

07:52.670 --> 07:55.161
UNTIL ONE OF THE PRONGS
PAYS OFF.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.837
LOOK AT US.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.749
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE LOOK LIKE?

08:03.850 --> 08:06.842
- HOMOS.
- ( both chuckle )

08:06.950 --> 08:08.770
Man:
HE WANTED TO BE CREMATED.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.780
- NO, HE DIDN'T!
- WE HAD A CONVERSATION.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.983
- HE WAS MY BROTHER.
- HE WAS MY BROTHER TOO.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.354
AND IF CARL
SAYS HE WANTED
TO BE CREMATED,

08:15.460 --> 08:16.779
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.585
- OVER MY DEAD BODY!
- FINE WITH ME!

08:18.690 --> 08:20.248
CAN WE PLEASE
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH?

08:20.360 --> 08:22.920
- SHE WAS ALWAYS DIFFICULT.
- YOU LEAVE HER ALONE.

08:23.030 --> 08:25.828
IS THERE SOMETHING
IN YOUR FAITH THAT MIGHT
PROVIDE US WITH SOME...

08:25.930 --> 08:28.194
- GUIDELINES.
- WE HAVE NO FAITH.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.336
- WE DID WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN.
- THIS IS AMERICA.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.375
SINCE WHEN DO WE HAVE
TO HAVE A FAITH IN ORDER
TO BURY OUR BROTHER?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.708
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO IMPLY, SIR...

08:34.810 --> 08:36.505
WE'RE CATHOLIC,
BUT LAPSED.

08:36.610 --> 08:39.875
YOU MAY BE LAPSED.
VERA AND I STILL GO
TO MASS EVERY SUNDAY.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.039
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME!
THERE IS NO GOD.

08:42.150 --> 08:45.745
ALL I KNOW IS
DANNY DID NOT WANT
TO BE CREMATED.

08:45.850 --> 08:49.058
HE DID!
HE TOLD ME HIMSELF
SIX MONTHS AGO AT BINGO.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.789
HE TOLD YOU HE WANTED
TO BE CREMATED AT BINGO?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.629
LOOK, I THINK WHAT
WE ALL NEED TO DO

08:54.730 --> 08:56.823
IS TAKE A COLLECTIVE
DEEP BREATH,

08:56.930 --> 08:59.091
AND TRY TO BE HONEST
ABOUT WHAT WE THINK, UH...

08:59.200 --> 09:02.294
DANIEL WOULD HAVE WANTED.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.209
NOT WHAT WE MIGHT WANT.

09:12.750 --> 09:17.016
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE'S
JUST HERE TO SCOPE OUT
THE MOST ADORABLE KID.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.543
THEY'RE ALL ADORABLE--
ON THE SURFACE.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.255
ALL THESE KIDS HAVE GONE THROUGH
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGING SHIT
IN THEIR LIVES.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.089
LIKE WE HAVEN'T?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.920
THIS WHOLE THING'S
A LITTLE WEIRD,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:28.030 --> 09:30.828
- IT'S JUST KIDS PLAYING.
- IT'S NOT.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.262
THEY'RE ACUTELY AWARE
THAT THEY'RE BEING OBSERVED

09:33.370 --> 09:35.235
LIKE SOME ANIMALS
IN A ZOO.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.161
Kid:
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY BROTHER?

09:38.270 --> 09:40.135
H EY?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.003
WHAT ABOUT HER?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.738
SHE'S ADORABLE,
BUT SHE'S SURROUNDED.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.004
HI.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.431
HI.

10:13.540 --> 10:16.509
YOU KEEP GETTING
SAND IN YOUR SHOES?

10:16.610 --> 10:19.499
THAT'S WHY I HATE
SANDBOXES SO MUCH.

10:19.610 --> 10:21.817
THERE'S SO MUCH SAND
IN THEM.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.485
(gunfire on TV)

10:27.590 --> 10:29.558
Such a battle
in which the marines

10:29.660 --> 10:32.925
had a high-tech advantage,
and you're looking through it.

10:33.030 --> 10:36.227
They moved forward
in pitch black using
night vision--

10:36.330 --> 10:38.719
UM... THANKS THOUGH.

10:38.830 --> 10:42.163
I WASN'T SURE
IF YOU DID OR NOT.

10:42.270 --> 10:44.500
IN MY YOUNGER DAYS
I DID.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.771
BUT, UH...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.269
RIGHT NOW I'M NOT SURE
IT WOULD MIX SO WELL
WITH MY MEDS.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.644
PSHAW.

10:54.180 --> 10:56.887
YOU COULD EAT DOWNSTAIRS
WITH US, YOU KNOW?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.844
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

10:58.950 --> 11:01.714
BUT I'M KIND OF TRYING
TO AVOID MOM RIGHT NOW.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.026
YOU MIGHT WANNA
TAKE IT EASY ON HER.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.098
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.397
THAT PUTS HER
IN THE SAME BOAT AS
THE REST OF US, DOESN'T IT?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.160
I REALLY LIKE
THAT PIECE.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.698
GOD!

11:19.810 --> 11:21.778
WHY IS THAT LIKE
THE ONE THING THAT
PEOPLE LIKE?

11:21.880 --> 11:24.098
YOU KNOW?
SO I TORE UP
SOME PHOTOS,

11:24.210 --> 11:25.575
WHO CARES?

11:25.680 --> 11:28.843
IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY WANTS
THAT TO BE THE ONE THING
THAT I CAN DO.

11:28.950 --> 11:31.145
I JUST THINK
IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE,

11:31.250 --> 11:32.911
AND DISTURBING.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.614
- AND BEAUTIFUL.
- EH...

11:35.720 --> 11:38.223
ISN'T THAT WHAT ART
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.594
YEAH.
JUST RIGHT NOW,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.349
WITH ALL THE SHIT
GOING ON IN THE WORLD,

11:42.460 --> 11:45.293
ART SEEMS KIND OF
BESIDES THE POINT,
YOU KNOW?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.062
YEAH, I DO KNOW.

11:48.170 --> 11:51.230
PLUS, I'M JUST NOT
LIKE INSPIRED.

11:51.340 --> 11:55.731
WELL, IF THE MUSE
ISN'T WITH YOU, THE MUSE
ISN'T WITH YOU.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.604
EXACTLY, GEORGE.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.746
GEORGE!
HERE YOU ARE.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.647
YOU HAD ME SO WORRIED.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.581
I'M FINE.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.487
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

12:06.590 --> 12:09.252
I'M--
I'M JUST, UH...

12:09.360 --> 12:11.783
HANGING OUT.
DO YOU NEED ME
FOR SOMETHING?

12:11.890 --> 12:14.393
NO, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.327
YOU LEFI' YOUR LAUNDRY
IN THE DRYER

12:17.430 --> 12:19.762
SORRY.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.758
IS THAT MY FOOD?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.838
IT'S FROM THE FRIDGE.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.135
- THE FAMILY FRIDGE?
- YEAH, SO?

12:26.240 --> 12:29.732
- George: I'M COMING DOWN.
- NO, DON'T PLEASE.
STAY HERE.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.148
( phone ringing )

12:34.820 --> 12:36.572
YOUR PHONE'S RINGING.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.648
I KNOW.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.411
I JUST THOUGHT...

12:40.520 --> 12:42.579
YOU KNOW...

12:42.690 --> 12:45.454
MAYBE YOU WERE
TOO STONED.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.452
( sighs )

12:50.230 --> 12:51.868
HELLO?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.363
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN
ONE OF THESE BEFORE,
HAVE YOU?

12:57.470 --> 12:58.869
UH-HUH.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.131
THIS IS FUN, HUH?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.174
UH-HUH.

13:06.750 --> 13:10.447
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
IF I DON'T STOP DOING THIS,
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.259
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:18.360 --> 13:21.295
YEAH,
JUST A LITTLE QUEASY,
THAT'S ALL.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.426
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD EVER BE
AN ASTRONAUT.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.331
WHY NOT?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.795
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T THROW UP
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN ASTRONAUT.

13:29.910 --> 13:34.370
I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT THAT WAY, BUT I
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.171
MY MOM'S COMING BACK
TO GET ME.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.168
SHE IS?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.872
AS SOON AS SHE GETS
OUT OF REHAB.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.641
THAT'S IN SIX MORE WEEKS.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.184
OH.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.178
( Keith sighs )

13:48.290 --> 13:50.258
I COULDN'T BREAK THROUGH
THE GAUNTLET.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.679
THIS IS ANTHONY.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.291
HI, ANTHONY.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.699
- ANTHONY, THIS IS KEITH.
- HI.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.392
ANTHONY'S NOT UP
FOR ADOPTION.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.639
- YOU'RE NOT?
- NO.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.163
MY MOM'S COMING BACK
TO GET ME.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.100
GOOD FOR YOU.

14:07.210 --> 14:09.098
THE MOON BOUNCE
MAKE YOU HURL?

14:09.210 --> 14:10.802
NO.
- ( laughs ) ALMOST.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.549
( chuckles )
YEAH, HE GETS
MOTION SICKNESS.

14:13.650 --> 14:17.279
- HE COULD NEVER
BE AN ASTRONAUT.
- NO WAY.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.244
( Keith laughs )

14:23.960 --> 14:25.825
UM, EXCUSE ME.
HI.

14:25.930 --> 14:29.093
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT YOUR KID WAS PICKING
ON MY KID DURING RECESS.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.521
- EXCUSE ME?
- TELL HER.

14:31.630 --> 14:33.291
HE PUSHED ME DOWN
IN THE BATHROOM

14:33.400 --> 14:35.095
AND TRIED TO TAKE
MY "YU-GI-OH" BACKPACK.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.600
NO, THAT'S--
CAN'T BE TRUE.

14:37.710 --> 14:42.272
- HE MUST HAVE JULIO
MIXED UP WITH SOME OTHER KID.
- NO, HE SAID IT WAS YOUR KID.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.302
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
IS IT, JULIO?

14:44.410 --> 14:47.208
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
WOULD YOU?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.618
- YOUR KID MADE
A MISTAKE, YOU SEE?
- IT WAS HIM!

14:49.720 --> 14:52.416
- HE JUST SAID HE DIDN'T DO IT.
- HE DID IT, HE'S LYING!

14:52.520 --> 14:54.886
- OKAY.
- MY SON DOESN'T LIE.
JULIO?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.753
I DIDN'T DO IT.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.181
- HE SAYS HE DIDN'T DO IT,
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
- HE DID IT!

14:59.290 --> 15:01.520
SO WHAT, IT WAS
JUST A STUPID GAME.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.030
* I GOT SOME TROUBLES

15:08.140 --> 15:10.062
* BUT THEY WON'T LAST

15:10.170 --> 15:12.707
* I'M GONNA LAY
RIGHT DOWN HERE... *

15:12.810 --> 15:14.937
HEY.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.837
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.872
OKAY.
YEAH, SURE.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.743
HOW ARE YOU?

15:20.850 --> 15:22.511
I'M GOOD.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.281
YEAH?
I'M GOOD TOO.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.354
OH...

15:29.460 --> 15:33.453
GOOD.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.360
IS THERE SOME SPECIFIC REASON
YOU COULDN'T TELL ME THAT
ON THE PHONE?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.368
YEAH.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.995
YEAH, I JUST NEEDED
TO SEE YOU.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.061
I COULD USE SOME...
CLOSURE.

15:44.170 --> 15:47.071
- THAT'S ALL.
- OKAY.

15:48.210 --> 15:51.509
- SHOULD WE ORDER?
- I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.475
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.685
IS THAT IT?
HAVE WE ACHIEVED CLOSURE?

16:04.790 --> 16:07.520
YEAH, I GUESS.
I JUST--

16:07.630 --> 16:09.518
WHAT?

16:09.630 --> 16:12.895
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.696
OKAY, I THINK I KNOW THAT.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.405
DO YOU STILL CARE
ABOUT ME?

16:18.510 --> 16:21.434
YEAH, OF COURSE
I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.440
BUT WE'RE BROKEN UP NOW.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.506
OF COURSE WE ARE.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.844
CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG?

16:28.950 --> 16:30.713
( scoffs )

16:30.820 --> 16:32.583
SURE.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.264
- OKAY, I'M GOING NOW.
- OH, GREAT.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.429
LOOK, CAN I WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR?

16:45.530 --> 16:47.464
NO.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.492
THANK YOU.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.465
ALL RIGHT.

16:51.570 --> 16:54.607
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE
AND HAVE A PIECE OF PIE.

16:54.710 --> 16:58.771
- Claire: BYE.
- * SU-SU-SU-SU-
SUGARTOWN. *

17:10.590 --> 17:12.148
HI.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.319
HELLO.
UH...?

17:14.430 --> 17:16.625
OH, I'M JUST HERE
TO PICK UP MY DAD.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.266
OH, COOL.
UH, HE'S UPSTAIRS.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.691
- GREAT.
- CARE FOR A MINT?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.564
WE BUY THEM IN BULK.

17:23.670 --> 17:26.161
- NO THANKS.
- YEAH.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.409
HEY, UH,
WOULD YOU LIKE

17:28.510 --> 17:30.273
TO COME OVER FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT?

17:30.380 --> 17:31.972
- HERE?
- NO, AT MY PLACE.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.140
I MEAN OUR PLACE--
BRENDA, MAYA AND ME,
I MEAN.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.218
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.015
- I'D LIKE THAT.
- ALL RIGHT.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.953
- WE'RE HERE.
- WITH THE FOOD.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.618
AH! UH...

17:43.730 --> 17:46.528
- OKAY, WELL, TOMORROW THEN.
- YEAH YEAH.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.224
WITH FOOD?
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT FOOD?

17:49.330 --> 17:51.127
THE COLD CUTS FOR DURING
THE VIEWING.

17:51.230 --> 17:54.131
- DANNY WOULD'VE
WANTED THERE TO BE FOOD.
- SO WE BROUGHT COLD CUTS.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.299
AND BACON-WRAPPED
HAM BALLS.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.561
IT'S WHAT HE
WOULD'VE WANTED.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.173
- WELL, OF COURSE, FINE.
- WHERE DO WE PUT 'EM?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.100
DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.178
OH, BUT WAIT,
YOU HAVE TO LET ME...
TAKE THOSE.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.168
I'LL PUT THEM
DOWN THERE.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.145
I GOT 'EM.
IT'S OKAY.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.309
Keith:
HE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT TO BE ADOPTED.

18:11.420 --> 18:16.084
OF COURSE HE'S GONNA SAY THAT.
HE'S GO'I'I'A PROTECT HIMSELF
FROM FURTHER REJECTION.

18:16.190 --> 18:19.182
I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS SPECIAL.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.622
NOT RETARDED SPECIAL.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.018
YOU CONNECTED
WITH HIM TOO, YOU KNOW?

18:25.130 --> 18:27.018
HE HAS SERIOUS
PROBLEMS, DAVID.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.630
YOU LIKED HIM,
YOU KNOW YOU DID.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.560
- HE WAS KINDA CUTE.
- HE WAS, WASN'T HE?

18:30.670 --> 18:33.434
YEAH, IN A FUCKED-UP-
WITH-SERIOUS-PROBLEMS
KIND OF WAY.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.532
- I WANT HIM.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.676
I THINK WE COULD GIVE HIM
A HAPPY CHILDHOOD.

18:38.780 --> 18:42.147
WE CAN'T UNDO ANYTHING
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED
TO HIM, YOU KNOW THAT.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.480
- YES, I KNOW THAT.
- IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING

18:44.590 --> 18:46.683
THAT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED TO YOU EITHER.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.156
I KNOW THAT TOO.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.824
I JUST THINK IT'S DOABLE.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.888
( tapping on glass )

19:01.970 --> 19:03.528
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:03.640 --> 19:06.404
I HEARD JULIO
GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.330
WHO DID YOU HEAR
THAT FROM?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.169
I'M ON THE CARNIVAL
PLANNING COMMITTEE.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.046
ONE OF THE MOMS TOLD ME
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
TO SEE IF I COULD HELP.

19:14.150 --> 19:16.038
SINCE WHEN A YOU ON
THE CARNIVAL COMMITTEE?

19:16.150 --> 19:17.947
I DON'T SEE THEM
EVERY DAY AT HOME.

19:18.050 --> 19:20.883
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I BE INVOLVED
AT SCHOOL.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.548
IT'S FINE.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.026
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- HE PICKED ON ONE
OF THE OTHER BOYS.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.928
- FOR NO REASON?
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

19:28.030 --> 19:30.396
OH SURE,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.764
JUST LIKE US SLEEPING TOGETHER
IS NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

19:32.870 --> 19:34.895
LET'S JUST PRETEND
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.661
IT'S JUST BOYS
BEING BOYS, RICO!

19:36.770 --> 19:38.408
YEAH, WHERE IS HE?
I WANNA TALK TO HIM.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.603
IT'S LATE.
HE'S IN BED.
THEY'RE BOTH IN BED.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.508
WHEN I WAS A KID,
WHEN I GOT INTO TROUBLE
MY OLD MAN TOOK A BELT TO ME.

19:43.610 --> 19:45.168
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT YOUR OLD MAN.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.714
- CAN I COME IN?
- NO, YOU CANNOT COME IN!

19:47.820 --> 19:50.482
NOT TONIGHT, RICO.
I'M TAKING CARE OF THIS.
GO HOME.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.427
- IS SHE ASLEEP?
- YEAH.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.049
I WANNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.448
OKAY.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.212
FIRST OF ALL,
IT MADE ME ANGRY THAT YOU
WOULD SAY THAT TO HER

20:26.320 --> 20:28.709
WITHOUT US TALKING
ABOUT IT FIRST.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.398
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.928
I AM SORRY.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.895
THANK YOU.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.299
BUT NATE, IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.209
YES, I AM ALL IN FAVOR
OF BEING HONEST WITH HER

20:44.310 --> 20:46.801
ABOUT WHERE SHE CAME FROM
AND WHO SHE IS.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.504
I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD
FOLLOW HER LEAD ON THIS ONE.

20:49.610 --> 20:54.070
WHEN SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO START
ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS,
THEN WE'LL ANSWER THEM.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.684
BUT JUST BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE
TO ASK THE QUESTIONS

20:57.790 --> 21:00.611
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SHE ISN'T MENTALLY
CAPABLE OF ASKING THEM.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.587
RIGHT...
I JUST THINK THAT YOU'RE
GONNA CONFUSE HER.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.453
OKAY, LISTEN.
ONE DAY SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT

21:05.560 --> 21:07.255
THAT I AM NOT
HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.864
NOW, I'M TRYING
TO AVOID THAT MOMENT
OF HORRIBLE EXPLANATION.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.859
THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A HORRIBLE MOMENT OF ANYTHING.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.939
KIDS NEED TO KNOW THEIR STORIES,
IT'S HOW THEY INTEGRATE
THEIR SENSE OF SELF.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.578
KIDS DON'T NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING. THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.500
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.646
SO I GREW UP WITH PARENTS
WHO HAD NO BOUNDARIES.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.241
YOU GREW UP WITH PARENTS
THAT HAD NOTHING BUT BOUNDARIES.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.647
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS
SO MUCH BETTER?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.581
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
THROWING SHIT AT HER

21:30.690 --> 21:33.579
FROM SOME BOOK
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
FINISHED READING YET!

21:33.690 --> 21:36.989
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER
AND I GET TO DECIDE THAT MUCH.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.761
( water running )

21:45.870 --> 21:50.136
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD
I CAN'T EVEN STAND TO SIT
AT THE DINNER TABLE WITH HIM.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.231
RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.069
THEY DO, THEY DO.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.740
DOES HE BITE HIS FORK?
I HAD A BOYFRIEND ONCE
WHO BIT HIS FORK,

21:56.840 --> 21:58.569
AND IT SO GAVE ME
THE CHILLS.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.716
NO, HE DOESN'T
BITE HIS FORK.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.277
HE'S NOT BEING ABUSIVE
IN ANY WAY, IS HE?

22:03.390 --> 22:05.688
NO NO NO, HE JUST
INSISTS ON TALKING

22:05.790 --> 22:08.350
ABOUT EVERYTHING,
ALL THE TIME.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.280
I CAN'T STAND THE SOUND
OF HIS VOICE.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.529
IT'S LIKE FINGERNAILS
ON A BLACKBOARD.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.518
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.120
WHAT?

22:16.230 --> 22:20.189
A FRIEND OF MINE NURSED
HER HUSBAND THOUGH CANCER
A FEW YEAR AGO,

22:20.300 --> 22:22.495
AND WHEN HE WAS CURED,
SHE WAS DONE.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.262
- WITH HIM?
- MM-HM.

22:25.370 --> 22:27.406
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT,
IT WASN'T HER FAULT,

22:27.510 --> 22:29.501
SHE WAS JUST DONE.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.373
YOU KNOW,
WE WERE TALKING...

22:33.480 --> 22:37.143
ABOUT GOING TO TANGIER
FOR A LITTLE SOMETHIN'.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.047
YOU WANNA COME, YEAH?

22:39.150 --> 22:42.278
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO GO HOME
AND FIX DINNER FOR GEORGE.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.278
OH, RUTH!
YOU NEED TO DO THINGS

22:44.390 --> 22:46.358
FOR YOURSELF
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.792
IT'S IMPORTANT--
CARE OF THE SELF.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.768
IT IS.
IT IS.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.367
OKAY.

22:59.310 --> 23:01.574
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT
ANTHONY LAST NIGHT.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.640
SEE, I KNEW
HE GOT TO YOU.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.775
HE KEPT PUTTING BLANKETS
ON TOP OF ME.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.939
EACH ONE WEIGHED
LIKE A TON.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.985
MY RIBS FELT LIKE
THEY WERE GONNA BREAK
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.479
OH...

23:14.590 --> 23:16.319
WELL, AT LEAST
HE MADE AN IMPRESSION.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.980
( phone rings )

23:24.870 --> 23:27.794
- HELLO.
- GUESS WHO'S PREGNANT!

23:27.900 --> 23:29.436
YOU ARE?

23:29.540 --> 23:31.804
That's right,
I'm having your guys's baby!

23:31.910 --> 23:34.708
- MARY'S PREGNANT.
- SHE IS?

23:34.810 --> 23:36.607
At first I thought
I was just late,

23:36.710 --> 23:40.248
BUT NOW I'M REALLY LATE,
PLUS I'VE BEEN CRAVING
CARNE ASADA.

23:40.350 --> 23:41.942
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

23:42.050 --> 23:44.041
Well, maybe you don't,
but I do.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.187
- SHOULD I TELL HER WE'RE HAPPY?
- I GUESS SO. I MEAN... YEAH.

23:47.290 --> 23:50.555
DAVID AND I ARE BOTH
VERY EXCITED.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.787
Me too, I mean,
at the very least this means

23:52.890 --> 23:54.790
I CAN START HAVING SEX
WITH MY HUSBAND AGAIN.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.118
HE WILL BE
SO FUCKING HAPPY.
YAY!

23:57.230 --> 24:00.290
LISTEN, I GOTTA G0.
I GOT DIARRHEA LIKE YOU
WOULD NOT BELIEVE.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.994
Which by the way,
is also

24:03.100 --> 24:05.603
A VERY POSITIVE SIGN.
BUT I'LL CALL YOU GUYS
LATER, OKAY?

24:05.710 --> 24:07.928
OKAY.
HEY, MARY?

24:08.040 --> 24:09.928
OH.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.941
WOW!

24:13.050 --> 24:14.472
WE'RE GONNA BE DADS!

24:14.580 --> 24:17.549
WHAT ABOUT ANTHONY?

24:22.220 --> 24:23.756
WELL, SOMEBODY ELSE
WILL FIND HIM.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.782
LOOK,
EXCEPT FOR TAYLOR,

24:25.890 --> 24:28.495
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH EXPERIENCE
WITH KIDS.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.522
AND I THINK TAKING ON
MORE THAN ONE RIGHT NOW

24:30.630 --> 24:33.861
- WOULD BE, UH--
- WOULD BE CRAZY.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.063
DO YOU DISAGREE?

24:37.400 --> 24:41.234
NO, I DON'T.

24:41.340 --> 24:45.674
( rock music playing )
* THERE GOES ELVIS KICKING UP
A LANDSLIDE *

24:45.780 --> 24:49.546
* CLOSE SHAVE, NOW HE'S BACK
ON THE FLIPSIDE *

24:49.650 --> 24:55.657
- ( phone ringing )
- * STRETCH TAXI GONNA FLY ME
TO THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL *

24:57.860 --> 25:00.158
* IT'S A BITCH, JACK...

25:00.260 --> 25:01.420
HELLO?

25:01.530 --> 25:03.088
Woman:
ClaIre?

25:03.200 --> 25:06.363
Hi, it's Margaret,
Margaret Chenowith.

25:06.470 --> 25:07.994
OH, HI.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.091
LISTEN, I HATE
TO CALL YOU LIKE THIS,

25:10.200 --> 25:12.907
BUT THERE'S
A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH BILLY.

25:13.010 --> 25:15.570
IS HE OKAY?

25:15.680 --> 25:18.478
WELL, PERHAPS IT WOULD BE
BETTER IF WE SPOKE IN PERSON.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.002
OH... OKAY.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.340
* I JUST WANT
TO FREE MYSELF-- *

25:22.450 --> 25:26.011
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO THE BOTH OF YOU

25:26.120 --> 25:27.712
FOR MY SON'S BEHAVIOR.

25:27.820 --> 25:29.788
YOUR WIFE WASN'T
VERY APOLOGETIC.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.825
THEN I APOLOGIZE
FOR HER BEHAVIOR AS WELL.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.990
YOU SEE, MY WIFE AND I
ARE SEPARATED, SO AS YOU
CAN IMAGINE

25:36.100 --> 25:40.093
- THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT
TIME FOR JULIO.
- OF COURSE.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.259
AND MY WIFE HAS BEEN
ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

25:42.370 --> 25:45.134
SO SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE LAX
ON DOLING OUT DISCIPLINE.

25:47.010 --> 25:50.229
PLUS SHE WAS DATING THIS GUY
WHO BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS
A TOTAL POTHEAD.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.399
AND FOR ALL I KNOW,
STILL IS.

25:52.510 --> 25:56.139
I JUST THINK ALL THE STUFF
AT HOME HAS CONTRIBUTED
TO JULIO ACTING OUT--

25:56.250 --> 25:58.047
WITH YOUR SON.

25:58.150 --> 26:01.756
AND I'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO JULIO AND HE WOULD LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOUR SON.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.250
TOMORROW MORNING,
BEFORE SCHOOL, IF THAT'S OKAY.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.851
YEAH YEAH.
UH, THAT WOULD
BE LOVELY.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.760
WELL, I WISH WE HAD
MORE FATHERS LIKE YOU
IN THIS SCHOOL.

26:11.870 --> 26:14.964
YEAH WELL,
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR.
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHY

26:15.070 --> 26:17.709
I'M A LITTLE BETTER AT DEALING
WITH PEOPLE THAN MY WIFE--

26:17.810 --> 26:20.108
WELL, MY ALMOST-EX-WIFE.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.906
SO-- DO YOU THINK THAT

26:26.010 --> 26:29.616
IT'S OUR IMPENDING DIVORCE
THAT'S CAUSING JULIO TO...

26:29.720 --> 26:32.348
YOU KNOW, MISBEHAVE?

26:34.490 --> 26:35.980
I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

26:36.090 --> 26:39.218
THANK YOU FOR BEING
HONEST WITH ME.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.458
YOU KNOW...

26:42.560 --> 26:45.393
THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON
AS WELL.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.365
( polka music playing )

26:47.470 --> 26:48.937
FRANKIE YANKOVIC
WAS HIS FAVORITE.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.065
FRANKIE YANKOVIC
WAS NOT HIS FAVORITE.

26:51.170 --> 26:53.502
HE WAS HIS FAVORITE.
HE HAD ALL HIS RECORDS.

26:53.610 --> 26:54.838
ALL OF THEM!

26:54.940 --> 26:56.999
HERBIE HANCOCK
WAS HIS FAVORITE.

26:57.110 --> 27:00.307
HE WANTED HERBIE HANCOCK
PLAYED AT HIS FUNERAL.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.243
- HE TOLD ME THAT, YEARS AGO.
- OKAY, LOOK...

27:03.350 --> 27:06.979
MAYBE HE HAD TWO FAVORITES.
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

27:07.090 --> 27:09.217
WHO THE HELL
HAS TWO FAVORITES?

27:09.320 --> 27:12.221
I HAVE TWO FAVORITES.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.321
IN FACT, I HAVE AT LEAST
THREE FAVORITE SONGS.

27:14.430 --> 27:17.490
AND MY DAUGHTER--
YOU KNOW WHAT HER
FAVORITE COLOR IS?

27:17.600 --> 27:20.091
BLUE... AND GREEN.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.328
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO, WE'RE GONNA
PLAY FRANKIE YANKOVIC

27:23.440 --> 27:26.068
AND HERBIE HANCOCK.
HOW'S THAT?

27:28.780 --> 27:31.544
Claire:
YOU SAID THIS WAS
SOME KIND OF EMERGENCY.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.369
I'VE NEVER SAID
EMERGENCY.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.712
YEAH, BUT YOU DEFINITELY
KIND OF IMPLIED IT.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.708
BILLY HAS
HARMED HIMSELF
IN THE PAST.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.310
HE COULD
DO IT AGAIN,
YOU KNOW?

27:42.420 --> 27:44.786
OKAY, THAT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.881
BILLY TOLD ME
EVERYTHING, CLAIRE.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.753
AND BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND--

27:48.860 --> 27:51.829
GIVEN THE FAMILY
YOU COME FROM--
WHY YOU ENDED IT.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.966
MY FAMILY DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.732
YOU KNOW BILLY ALSO TOLD ME
THAT THE SEX WAS ERRATIC.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.229
NOW THAT WAS HIS FAULT.

27:59.340 --> 28:02.434
AND BY THE WAY,
HE'S ON A NEW MEDICATION
WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.747
BUT HE DID SAY
THAT WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO,

28:04.850 --> 28:07.569
AND WHEN HE WAS UP FOR IT,
THE SEX WAS VERY GOOD.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.511
FOR BILLY, THAT'S REALLY
SAYING SOMETHING.

28:09.620 --> 28:12.088
HE TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR SEX?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.579
OF COURSE HE DID.
I'M HIS MOTHER!

28:14.690 --> 28:16.851
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
WERE WITH HIM,

28:16.960 --> 28:20.589
THERE WAS THIS LIGHT
BEHIND HIS EYES.

28:20.690 --> 28:23.124
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT
IN HIM SINCE HE WAS...

28:23.230 --> 28:25.118
I DON'T KNOW, FOUR?

28:25.230 --> 28:27.095
YOU WERE REALLY GOOD
FOR HIM, CLAIRE.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.065
HE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

28:29.170 --> 28:31.559
AND EVEN IF HE ISN'T,
I AM BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.934
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM HIM
TO MAKE THIS WORK?

28:34.040 --> 28:37.874
- THIS ISN'T A NEGOTIATION.
- EVERYTHING IS NEGOTIABLE.

28:37.980 --> 28:42.644
I HAVE A SON WHO
TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF
IN THE PAST.

28:42.750 --> 28:45.719
NOW HE STILL
REALLY LOVES YOU.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.789
AND I THINK
YOU STILL LOVE HIM.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.994
- HEY.
- HEY.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.338
- HOW'S MY GIRL DOING, HUH?
- GOOD.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.000
ARE YOU GOOD, YEAH?
YOU HELPING MOMMY
MAKE SOME DINNER?

29:04.110 --> 29:06.328
- UH-HUH.
- ALL RIGHT.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.774
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
DO YOU NEED HELP
WITH ANYTHING?

29:11.880 --> 29:14.474
YEAH, YOU CANNOT ACT
LIKE AN A-HOLE TONIGHT
AT DINNER.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.219
NOW WHY WOULD
I ACT LIKE AN A-HOLE
AT DINNER TONIGHT?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.288
BECAUSE YOU WERE
AN A-HOLE LAST NIGHT.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.756
SHE'S NOT JUST YOUR
DAUGHTER ANYMORE.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.522
- DO YOU KNOW HOW
OFFENSIVE THAT WAS?
- ( phone ringing )

29:24.630 --> 29:27.326
CAN WE PUT A PIN
IN THIS, PLEASE?
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

29:27.430 --> 29:29.921
- OKAY, FINE!
- HELLO?

29:30.030 --> 29:32.521
HI.

29:32.630 --> 29:36.134
UH, YEAH, SURE.
THAT'S FINE.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.208
POSITIVE.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.870
I'M SURE.
OKAY?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.629
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

29:42.740 --> 29:46.244
SO, UH, WE NEED
TO SET AN EXTRA PLATE
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.614
- MAGGIE'S GONNA
BRING GEORGE.
- OOH.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.211
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO SAY NO TO HER?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.953
THERE YOU ARE.
I'LL TAKE THAT.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.494
( sighs )
I SHOULD GO.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.569
NO, STAY.
BESIDES, I SHOULD BE
THE ONE LEAVING.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.776
YOU KNOW...
BILLY HAS A FEW THINGS
HE NEEDS TO SAY TO YOU,

30:14.880 --> 30:16.871
AND WHO KNOWS,
YOU TWO MAY HAVE
MORE TO TALK ABOUT

30:16.980 --> 30:18.572
THAN YOU EVEN REALIZE.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.211
HONEY, YOU BE SURE
AND CALL ME LATER, OKAY?

30:25.320 --> 30:27.447
- LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.
- OKAY, MOM.

30:27.550 --> 30:29.484
I'LL TAKE THIS.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.258
- YOU PLANNED THIS?
- I-I-- I JUST

30:34.360 --> 30:39.525
WASN'T COMPLETELY SURE
IF I MADE MYSELF CLEAR
YESTERDAY.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.769
IF THERE IS EVER A MOMENT

30:41.870 --> 30:43.462
ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE,

30:43.570 --> 30:45.458
WHETHER IT'S IN A HOUR

30:45.570 --> 30:48.539
OR A MONTH OR A YEAR,

30:48.640 --> 30:50.574
WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND

30:50.680 --> 30:53.478
ABOUT... YOU KNOW,

30:53.580 --> 30:55.218
US,

30:55.320 --> 30:58.084
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WOULD BE OPEN
TO THAT.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.511
YOU USED YOUR MOTHER
TO AMBUSH ME?

31:00.620 --> 31:02.315
IT WASN'T
AN AMBUSH EXACTLY.

31:02.420 --> 31:05.651
- I AM SO OUT OF HERE.
- LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW!

31:05.760 --> 31:09.025
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU

31:09.130 --> 31:11.496
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD

31:11.600 --> 31:13.420
NOT KNOWING HOW I FEEL.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.464
OKAY, I GET IT.

31:15.570 --> 31:17.299
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

31:17.400 --> 31:19.561
BUT THAT IS NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.298
SO YOU KNOW
BEYOND ANY DOUBT

31:23.410 --> 31:25.947
THAT YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT ME AGAIN?

31:26.050 --> 31:28.439
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.485
( sobbing )

31:37.760 --> 31:40.957
( forced laugh )
HOW CAN YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO FEEL IN THE FUTURE?

31:41.060 --> 31:43.528
I MEAN, HOW CAN
ANYBODY KNOW THAT?

31:43.630 --> 31:45.222
GOD, I'VE GOTTA GO.

31:45.330 --> 31:48.060
- CLAIRE, CLAIRE...
- TO THE BATHROOM.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.661
- ...DON'T LEAVE ME.
- I WON'T.

31:50.770 --> 31:53.159
I'M JUST GONNA RUN
TO THE LADIES' ROOM
FOR A SECOND.

31:53.270 --> 31:56.433
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY?
- OKAY.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.596
YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT OUR SITUATION
AT HOME?

32:21.700 --> 32:24.430
I DIDN'T GO
INTO DETAILS, NO.

32:24.540 --> 32:27.031
BUT HE'S THE PRINCIPAL
AT OUR SON'S SCHOOL.

32:27.140 --> 32:31.144
AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR
SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION
FOR JULIO'S BEHAVIOR.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.548
- HE WAS VERY CONCERNED.
- HE IS?

32:33.650 --> 32:36.073
HE SAID OUR DIVORCE
IS CAUSING JULIO
TO LASH OUT,

32:36.180 --> 32:38.740
AND FRANKLY,
HE'S SURPRISED THAT IT
HASN'T CAUSED HIM

32:38.850 --> 32:41.410
MORE PROBLEMS
THAN IT ALREADY HAS.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.454
HE DID?

32:43.560 --> 32:45.528
HE WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.027
IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME, RICO.
THE BOYS ARE GETTING OLDER,

32:53.130 --> 32:55.462
I'M DOING THIS ALONE.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.788
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS THAT MUCH
OF A PROBLEM.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.936
IT'S OKAY.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.532
I'M ON TOP OF IT.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.744
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT.

33:07.750 --> 33:12.187
- ( knocks )
- WHO IS AT THE DOOR?
WHO IS AT THIS DOOR?

33:12.290 --> 33:15.157
- GRANDPA AND MAGGIE.
- YEAH!

33:15.260 --> 33:17.387
- HEY, YOU GUYS,
COME|_(|)IN IN.

33:17.490 --> 33:20.152
HEY!
OH, THANK YOU.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.592
- Maggie: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GEORGE, WELCOME.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.089
- I HOPE IT'S OKAY
I BROUGHT MY DAD.
- OH, OF COURSE.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.497
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.989
PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M NOT HERE.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.034
NOW I JUST, UH,
WANT TO SAY...

33:31.140 --> 33:33.267
IF NATE AND I SEEM
A LITTLE TENSE TONIGHT,

33:33.370 --> 33:35.179
IT'S, UH,
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.077
- HEY, BRENDA!
- WE'VE BEEN HAVING A FIGHT.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.841
- A FIGHT?
- YES.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.372
NO, WE HAVEN'T BEEN
HAVING A FIGHT.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.414
- WE JUST HAD
A DISAGREEMENT.
- WHAT ABOUT?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.841
- DAD!
- IT'S ABOUT WHEN
MAYA SHOULD--

33:44.950 --> 33:47.919
BRENDA, MAYBE WE SHOULD
DO THIS WHEN THERE'S
NO COMPANY HERE.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.658
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.558
BUT IF YOU FEEL
A WEIRD ENERGY IN THE AIR,

33:52.660 --> 33:55.527
IT'S US.
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.297
SHALL WE START
ONHE WHITE?

33:59.400 --> 34:03.291
- PLEASE.
- ( Maya babbles ) MAGGIE.

34:06.770 --> 34:10.035
SO IF HE'S MORE
OR LESS ALL BETTER,
WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE HIM?

34:10.140 --> 34:12.779
I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.542
THE WAY HE LOOKS AT ME,
I JUST SEE THE LITTLE BOY
IN HIM, YOU KNOW?

34:15.650 --> 34:17.811
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MY PROBLEM WITH MEN.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.286
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF THEY'RE 10 OR 80.

34:20.390 --> 34:23.211
I SEE THEM...
STANDING THERE

34:23.320 --> 34:26.084
LIKE CHILDREN
IN SHORT PANTS.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.057
JUST... SKINNY
LITTLE BOYS, LOST.

34:29.160 --> 34:32.618
WHY DO I ALWAYS PICK MEN
WITH SUCH SKINNY LEGS?

34:34.470 --> 34:36.290
I'M A HORRIBLE TRAIN WRECK
OF A PERSON.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.231
OH, YOU ARE NOT
A HORRIBLE TRAIN WRECK!

34:38.340 --> 34:39.967
- I AM.
- YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE HUMAN.

34:40.070 --> 34:42.903
- YEAH.
- AND THERE'S A LIMIT
TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE!

34:43.010 --> 34:44.705
BUT I MADE A VOW
TO THIS MAN!

34:44.810 --> 34:47.699
- OH GOD, SHE FEELS
EVERYTHING SO DEEPLY.
- RUTH,

34:47.810 --> 34:51.485
MARRIAGE,
ESPECIALLY TO SOMEONE WHO
IS MAKING YOU MISERABLE,

34:51.590 --> 34:53.842
DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART.

34:53.950 --> 34:56.783
BUT HE'S SWEET...
AND ILL.

34:56.890 --> 34:59.927
HE LIVES WITH ME IN MY HOUSE
AND HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

35:00.030 --> 35:01.725
WHAT ABOUT
HIS DAUGHTER MAGGIE?

35:01.830 --> 35:04.094
SHE HAS HER OWN LIFE
TO LIVE.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.027
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.960
I HAD A FRIEND ONCE,

35:10.070 --> 35:12.004
A ROMANTIC FRIEND,

35:12.110 --> 35:14.476
AND HE HAD A VERY BAD
PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.037
- OH GOD!
- SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

35:17.140 --> 35:19.472
- WHAT?
- I DRIED HIM OUT.

35:19.580 --> 35:23.118
I CALLED EVERYBODY
I COULD THINK OF,

35:23.220 --> 35:25.415
I GOT HIM A JOB,
I GOT HIM AN APARTMENT.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.045
AND WHEN I WAS SURE
HE WAS SAFE,

35:28.160 --> 35:30.617
I CUT HIM LOOSE.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.151
I COULD NEVER DO THAT.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.996
( sighs )

35:38.100 --> 35:39.829
George:
THAT WAS A LOVELY DINNER,

35:39.930 --> 35:43.263
EVEN IF IT WAS PREPARED
UNDER TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES.

35:43.370 --> 35:46.237
- IT WAS DELICIOUS.
- THANK YOU.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.332
- HOW'S SHE?
- SHE'S OUT LIKE A LIGHT.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.045
THAT LITTLE GIRL
CAN FALL ASLEEP AT
THE DROP OF A HAT.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.039
HA!
MOST OF THE TIME.

35:55.150 --> 35:59.041
WHATEVER YOU TWO WERE
ARGUING ABOUT EARLIER
SEEMS TO HAVE BLOWN OVER.

35:59.150 --> 36:01.482
UH, WELL...

36:01.590 --> 36:03.683
IT WASN'T
AN ARGUMENT REALLY.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.554
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
THE POSSIBILITY OF TELLING MAYA

36:06.660 --> 36:10.096
- THAT BRENDA IS NOT
HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.
- SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER LISA?

36:10.200 --> 36:12.327
1--

36:12.430 --> 36:14.466
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S--

36:14.570 --> 36:18.336
SHE'S BARELY WALKING.
HOW CAN YOU KNOW FOR SURE?

36:18.440 --> 36:21.307
I THINK SHE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW HER STORY,

36:21.410 --> 36:24.299
AND HOW I CAME
TO BE HER MOMMY.

36:24.410 --> 36:26.799
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE
ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.218
YEAH?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.948
LISA'S BROTHER-IN-LAW,
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

36:31.050 --> 36:32.847
HOYT.

36:32.950 --> 36:36.511
DID THEY EVER DETERMINE
FOR CERTAIN IF HE WAS
INVOLVED IN LISA'S DEATH?

36:36.620 --> 36:39.589
- DAD--
- NO NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.397
UH...

36:42.500 --> 36:44.422
LOOK, WITH BOTH LISA
AND HOYT DEAD,

36:44.530 --> 36:46.725
THEY DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.633
AND NO ONE EVER WILL.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.300
- BUT YOU THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
- I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.208
YES, I'M PRETTY SURE
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

36:55.310 --> 36:57.505
BECAUSE
KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED
IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

36:57.610 --> 36:59.441
IN FACT, KNOWING
WHAT HAPPENS IS CRUCIAL.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.347
I SAID I THINK
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.315
DO YOU HAVE
CLOSURE ABOUT IT?

37:03.420 --> 37:06.617
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, NO,
I DON'T HAVE CLOSURE.
- Brenda: GEORGE!

37:06.720 --> 37:09.689
I THINK WE SHOULD
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

37:12.660 --> 37:16.528
OH, I'M SORRY.
MY MEDICATION MAKES ME
FEEL A LITTLE WONKY.

37:16.630 --> 37:18.791
AND IF I GET A THOUGHT
OR QUESTION IN MY HEAD,

37:18.900 --> 37:21.539
IT KEEPS GOING
ROUND AND ROUND
LIKE IT'S CAUGHT

37:21.640 --> 37:23.494
IN SOME KIND
OF ENDLESS LOOP.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.807
SORRY.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.299
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

37:31.310 --> 37:33.505
Keith:
HERE'S TO OUR BABY.

37:33.610 --> 37:35.612
YAY!

37:37.180 --> 37:39.148
IS THIS ALCOHOLIC?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.138
NO, IT'S JUST
SPARKLING CIDER.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.684
TOO BAD.
MY OB-GYN SAYS IT'S OKAY

37:43.790 --> 37:45.951
TO HAVE A GLASS
OR TWO OF RED WINE

37:46.060 --> 37:47.925
UP UNTIL
THE SECOND TRIMESTER.

37:48.030 --> 37:51.591
- REALLY?
- LISTEN, I DON'T WANNA
WORRY YOU GUYS OR ANYTNG,

37:51.700 --> 37:54.635
BUT I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
WITH A TINY BIT OF SPOTTING.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.833
WHICH IS NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT,

37:56.940 --> 37:59.431
I SPOTTED THROUGH ALL
MY OTHER PREGNANCIES.

37:59.540 --> 38:02.771
BESIDES, I'M STILL HAVING
MY CRAVINGS FOR MEAT SO I
JUST KNOW I'M PREGNANT.

38:02.880 --> 38:07.340
- YOU'RE SURE?
- SPOTTING IS PAR
FOR THE COURSE.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.111
BESIDES, MY BOOBS
ARE SO SORE,

38:09.220 --> 38:11.108
I CAN HARDLY
PUT ON A BRA.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.745
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
WEARING ONE.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.818
- IS THERE ANY MORE LOX?
- YEAH.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.298
Judge:
Why would you sign it
if it's not a loan?

38:23.400 --> 38:26.369
- Either you sold a car to him--
- You don't understand English?

38:26.470 --> 38:28.119
- Excuse me?
- I Just said--

38:28.230 --> 38:29.959
All right, baby,
I understand English.

38:30.070 --> 38:33.107
- Okay.
- I just don't
understand liars.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.735
GETTING HIGH
IN THE MORNING, HUH?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.988
MOM WANTS ME
TO GET A JOB.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.978
CAN YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

38:47.090 --> 38:49.854
WE ALL HAVE TO WORK, CLAIRE.
WE ALL HAVE TO GET A JOB.

38:49.960 --> 38:54.829
WHY CAN'T ANYONE
IN THIS FAMILY JUST
LET ME FUCKING BE?

38:58.670 --> 39:00.626
BECAUSE I JUST FLASHED
ON MAYA AT YOUR AGE

39:00.730 --> 39:03.767
SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV
FEELING SORRY FOR HERSELF...

39:04.870 --> 39:07.009
NOT CARING ABOUT
ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.

39:09.540 --> 39:12.043
IT JUST BROKE MY HEART.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.556
BYE, I LOVE YOU.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.855
- MRS. DIAZ.
- YEAH?

39:27.960 --> 39:30.758
I, UH,
I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT
HAVE A WORD WITH YOU...

39:30.860 --> 39:32.725
IN MY OFFICE.

39:33.730 --> 39:36.369
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

39:36.470 --> 39:38.529
( Herbie Hancock
music playing )

39:38.640 --> 39:40.801
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW
WHAT WE ENDED UP PAYING.

39:40.910 --> 39:42.832
- WHAT, FOR THE CASKET?
- THE CASKET IS ONE THING.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.773
- THEN THERE'S
EVERYTHING ELSE ON TOP.
- WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE?

39:45.880 --> 39:47.939
IT'S A LIST AS LONG
AS MY ARM, YOU DON'T
WANNA KNOW.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.348
- MAYBE I DON'T WANNA KNOW.
- BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.611
BUT THAT'S WHAT MONEY
IS FOR, FOR TIMES
LIKE THIS.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.359
GOD BLESS HIM.
HE WAS A SON OF A BITCH,
BUT GOD BLESS HIM.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.052
- HE LOOKS GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.378
BULLSHIT!
HE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
HE LOOKS DEAD.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.424
HE IS DEAD.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.522
SO HAVE YOU GUYS
FIGURED OUT WHAT YOU
WANNA DO WITH HIS REMAINS?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.495
CARL AND I WANNA
HAVE HIM CREMATED

40:06.600 --> 40:08.465
AND SCATTERED OFF
THE SANTA MONICA PIER.

40:08.570 --> 40:10.265
THAT'S WHERE HE LIKED
TO GO FISHING.

40:10.370 --> 40:12.167
HE TOLD ME
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED.

40:12.270 --> 40:15.728
YOUR SISTER IS STILL
ARGUING FOR A PLOT
AT FOREST LAWN.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.728
TOUGH SHIT.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.604
I'M HUNGRY.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.440
LET'S GO EAT SOME HAM BALLS
BEFORE THEY'RE ALL ATE UP.

40:27.190 --> 40:30.353
NO OFFENSE, PAL,
BUT YOUR FAMILY IS A BUNCH
OF FUCKED UP CONTROL FREAKS.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.621
WHOSE ISN'T?

40:32.730 --> 40:36.598
MM, I WISH YOU
COULD JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.362
YOU'RE ASKING ME
WHAT I WANT?

40:39.470 --> 40:41.859
YEAH, IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

40:41.970 --> 40:44.905
FOR 20 YEARS NOBODY EVER
ASKED ME ANYTHING.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.535
THIS IS WHAT I WANT...

40:49.640 --> 40:53.076
I WANT MAYA TO HAVE
A MOMMY.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.380
GEORGE?

41:06.490 --> 41:09.220
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT

41:09.330 --> 41:12.561
AND I THINK I WANT US
TO MOVE OUT.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.558
MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE?

41:14.670 --> 41:17.468
YES, I THINK IT WOULD
BE BEST FOR BOTH OF US.

41:17.570 --> 41:20.459
THIS HOUSE IS TOO FULL
OF BAD MEMORIES.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.936
I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE
A FRESH START.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.178
WE COULD MAKE
A FRESH START,

41:26.280 --> 41:28.305
LEAVE ALL OUR TROUBLES
BEHIND US.

41:28.410 --> 41:30.469
THAT'S RIGHT.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.456
WHAT ON EARTH
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

41:36.560 --> 41:38.312
- I'M JUST GETTING SOME FOOD.
- GET OUT OF HERE!

41:38.420 --> 41:41.253
I'M TRYING TO HAVE
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION
WITH MY HUSBAND.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.796
GET OUT!
GO GET A JOB!
LEAVE NOW!

41:48.500 --> 41:50.263
( slams door)

41:53.440 --> 41:56.375
I MADE US
AN APPOINTMENT TO...

41:56.480 --> 41:59.904
LOOK AT A PLACE
NEAR PARK LA BREA.

42:00.010 --> 42:02.171
THAT IS WITHIN
WALKING DISTANCE
OF THE MUSEUMS.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.544
AND THE FARMER'S MARKET.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.784
DO YOU REALLY WANT
A NEW BEGINNING?

42:09.890 --> 42:12.984
BECAUSE NOTHING WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPIER.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.759
( knocking )

42:23.400 --> 42:25.504
- MARY.
- SORRY I DIDN'T BUZZ,

42:25.610 --> 42:30.001
BUT SOME OLD LADY
WAS COMING OUT THE FRONT,
SO I JUST SLIPPED INSIDE.

42:30.110 --> 42:32.101
OKAY, ARE YOU GUYS
SITTING DOWN?

42:32.210 --> 42:34.576
UH... IAM.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.875
- WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?
- I GOT MY PERIOD.

42:36.980 --> 42:39.039
JUST ABOUT
10 MINUTES AGO.

42:39.150 --> 42:42.586
- I CAME RIGHT OVER
TO LET YOU KNOW.
- BUT YOU TOOK A TEST.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.853
- DIDN'T YOU?
- NO.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.951
- OH.
- I'M REALLY SORRY, YOU GUYS,

42:48.060 --> 42:50.051
BUT ACTUALLY,
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING,

42:50.160 --> 42:54.665
'CAUSE I DID JUST
GET A NEW SET OF X-RAYS
AT THE DENTIST LAST WEEK.

42:54.770 --> 42:57.159
CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

43:11.990 --> 43:13.412
WELL...

43:13.520 --> 43:15.784
DO YOU STILL WANT
TO ADOPT ANTHONY?

43:23.000 --> 43:26.322
YOU TOLD OUR SON'S
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL THAT I
WAS DATING A DRUG ADDICT!

43:26.430 --> 43:28.421
I NEVER SAID DRUG ADDICT.

43:28.530 --> 43:30.498
WHAT I SAID WAPOTHEAD.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.704
KENNY NEVER EVEN TRIED
THE STUFF, RICO.

43:32.810 --> 43:35.506
THAT WAS HIS SISTER,
AND IT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

43:35.610 --> 43:37.237
AND I STOPPED
SEEING HIM MONTHS AGO.

43:37.340 --> 43:39.877
- I JUST--
- YOU ALSO TOLD HIM
I WAS ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS?

43:39.980 --> 43:42.676
- I SAID "WAS."
- YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
ABOUT US, RICO!

43:42.780 --> 43:44.987
- I DIDN'T TELL HIM EVERYTHING!
- HE WANTED TO KNOW

43:45.090 --> 43:48.446
IF THE TROUBLE
WITH THE BABYSITTER
INVOLVED ANY MOLESTATION.

43:48.550 --> 43:50.359
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT BABYSITTER?"

43:50.460 --> 43:53.224
HE SAID HE WAS REQUIRED BY LAW
TO REPORT IT TO THE POLICE,

43:53.330 --> 43:56.197
BUT THAT HE WANTED TGIVE ME
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT FIRST.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.860
I NEVER TOLD HIM MOLESTATION.
I SAID THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.768
AND THERE WAS,
YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP
TO GET HIM.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.060
WHAT THE FUCK, RICO?

44:05.170 --> 44:09.834
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
TO BRING MR. SCHUMACHER INTO THE
LOOP OF OUR FAMILY SITUATION.

44:09.940 --> 44:12.647
AND HE NEVER SAID
THAT JULIO'S PROBLEMS
AT SCHOOL

44:12.750 --> 44:16.311
WERE CAUSED BY US
BEING SEPARATED.

44:16.420 --> 44:21.119
- I WAS TRYING TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR JULIO, VANESSA.
- YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!

44:21.220 --> 44:23.882
LATELY I WAS THINKING THERE
MIGHT BE A CHANCE WE WOULD
GET BACK TOGETHER,

44:23.990 --> 44:26.720
BUT BOY, DO I NEED
MY FUCKING HEAD EXAMINED.

44:30.430 --> 44:34.196
( shudders )
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER
MARRIED A FUCKING EMBALMER!

44:47.510 --> 44:49.478
- HEY.
- HEY.

44:49.580 --> 44:52.242
- HOW WAS WORK?
- IT WAS OKAY.

44:53.790 --> 44:55.485
WHERE'S MAYA?

44:55.590 --> 44:59.026
SHE'S IN MY CLOSET,
PUTTING STUFFED KITTIES
IN ALL MY SHOES.

44:59.130 --> 45:00.449
( laughs )

45:04.560 --> 45:06.198
BRENDA, I'M SORRY.

45:11.740 --> 45:14.106
I'M SORRY.

45:15.510 --> 45:17.637
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HER?

45:17.740 --> 45:22.643
THAT HER REAL MOMMY GOT
PREGNANT AND TRAPPED ME
INTO MARRYING HER?

45:22.750 --> 45:26.015
THAT SHE WAS FUCKING
HER BROTHER-IN-LAW AND HE
MIGHT HAVE MURDERED HER

45:26.120 --> 45:28.213
BECAUSE SHE TRIED
TO BREAK IT OFF?

45:28.320 --> 45:31.312
THAT HE MIGHT EVEN BE
HER REAL DAD?

45:33.760 --> 45:36.320
I JUST WANTED TO SPARE
HER THAT, YOU KNOW?

45:37.860 --> 45:40.465
I WANTED TO SPARE ME THAT.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.163
OH GOD, NATE, I--

45:44.270 --> 45:46.909
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
OF ANY OF THAT.

45:59.420 --> 46:02.514
YOU KNOW, WE CAN BE HONEST
WITH MAYA ABOUT LISA
BEING THE MOTHER

46:02.620 --> 46:05.225
WITHOUT HAVING
TO GO THROUGH EVERY...

46:05.330 --> 46:07.286
DETAIL.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.125
BUT SOMEDAY--

46:13.230 --> 46:17.166
SOMEDAY SHE MIGHT
NEED TO KNOW.

46:17.270 --> 46:20.159
MM, BUT NOT NOW.

46:20.270 --> 46:22.431
NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

46:42.430 --> 46:45.888
WELL, HIS MOTHER'S IN REHAB
AND HIS FATHER'S WHEREABOUTS
ARE UNKNOWN.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.161
HIS SCHOOL WORK
IS A LITTLE...

46:48.270 --> 46:50.295
BELOW AVERAGE.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.732
HE'S A GOOD KID.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.035
HE'S VERY SENSITIVE,
VERY SWEET.

46:57.780 --> 47:00.169
UH, YOU KNOW
HE HAS AN OLDER SIBLING.

47:01.550 --> 47:03.768
- NO.
- NO, WE DIDN'T.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.246
YEAH, HIS NAME
IS DURRELL.

47:07.590 --> 47:11.287
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- ELEVEN.

47:11.390 --> 47:15.497
YOU KNOW WE DO PREFER TO TRY
TO KEEP SIBLINGS TOGETHER.

47:22.670 --> 47:25.161
SO WHEN DO WE MEET
DURRELL?

47:27.340 --> 47:32.073
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I LIKE IT.

47:32.180 --> 47:35.069
I THINK WE COU BE
VERY HAPPY HERE,
DON'T YOU?

47:35.180 --> 47:37.512
YES, GEORGE,
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
LIKE IT HERE.

47:37.620 --> 47:39.542
OH, I ALREADY DO.

47:43.360 --> 47:47.922
SO HERE WE ARE:
DAD AND MOM...

47:48.030 --> 47:51.249
AND YOU.
CAN YOU TURN
THE PAGE FOR ME?

47:51.360 --> 47:54.625
AND THIS IS LISA.

47:54.730 --> 47:56.459
SHE WAS
YOUR FIRST MOMMY,

47:56.570 --> 47:59.801
- YOUR BIOLOGICAL MOMMY.
- AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU
LIVED THERE.

47:59.910 --> 48:01.969
- YEAH.
- IN HER BELLY.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.378
FOR NINE WHOLE MONTHS.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

48:04.480 --> 48:07.608
JUST LIKE YOUR NEW
BROTHER OR SISTER IS LIVING
IN YOUR MOMMA'S BELLY NOW.

48:07.710 --> 48:10.178
AND SHE LOVED YOU.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.919
SHE LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH.

48:15.620 --> 48:18.453
NOW PUT A STICKER?

48:23.930 --> 48:24.692
( soft piano music playing )

48:24.800 --> 48:59.524
THAT WASN'T A PLUM TREE.
