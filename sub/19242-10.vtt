01:01.853 --> 01:03.271
You're a time traveler?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.110
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.489
You can't expect me to believe that.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.116
It's hard to believe,

01:16.201 --> 01:17.202
but it's true.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.957
Have you been drinking?

01:24.876 --> 01:25.919
That can't be it.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.674
Is today some special day?
Is this some sort of surprise?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.179
That's not it either.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.432
You saw it with your own eyes.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.311
The news that happened
as you said?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.564
Anyone could know that
by reading articles online.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.778
Guessing what people passing by would do?

01:52.570 --> 01:54.447
You figured that out
by observing them.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.083
Okay.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.547
Suppose that you really were here earlier
and saw everything.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.883
Then what will I say next?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.010
You were not planning to be here.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.637
I changed that

02:18.763 --> 02:20.014
and brought you here.

02:20.098 --> 02:20.932
Stop it.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.725
You're scaring me.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.816
You see the future?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.819
Then what about our future?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.489
What is our future like?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.678
How do you travel to the future?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.600
Do you go zooming in a car
like in "Back to the Future"?

03:06.102 --> 03:08.688
Or do you light incense like in "Nine"?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.483
Did you get them from the Himalayas?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.445
You don't like the mountains.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.074
-Let's stop here and finish talking.
-No, thanks.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.910
Just go. We don't need to talk again.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.998
You mentioned time traveling
in front of Ki-doong's place too.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.168
Why are you obsessed with time travel?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
There's teleportation, telepathy,
all sorts of things.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.257
Why the future, and not the past?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.843
Is the future already set in stone?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.178
Does that make sense?

03:43.348 --> 03:47.602
If you believe that it's so ridiculous,
why do you look like you're going to cry?

03:48.436 --> 03:49.270
Me?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.773
You look as if you're going to cry.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.446
You can't see me because you're driving,
but I'm laughing at the absurdity.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.960
So I married a time traveler?

04:13.711 --> 04:17.090
Then I'm the wife of a time traveler?

04:28.893 --> 04:32.313
LET'S HAVE A HAPPY LIFE!

04:37.151 --> 04:41.197
<i>Then... the election of a new president is</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:43.866
<i>really from the future?</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:45.368
RYU SUN-KWANG ELECTED PRESIDENT

04:45.451 --> 04:48.538
<i>The sneaker that wrapped itself</i>
<i>around my ankles and Ohri ramen...</i>

04:49.080 --> 04:49.914
<i>All of that?</i>

05:01.217 --> 05:02.051
All right.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.804
I'll do my best to accept it.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.810
-Vanish.
-What?

05:10.935 --> 05:13.563
I want you to go to the future
while I'm watching.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.733
Can you just disappear from anywhere?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.693
-The thing is...
-Well, then,

05:19.235 --> 05:20.611
go for a moment now.

05:21.112 --> 05:21.946
Well...

05:23.114 --> 05:24.198
Shall I count to three?

05:25.575 --> 05:26.409
One...

05:27.076 --> 05:27.910
Two...

05:28.953 --> 05:29.787
Three.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.289
-Song Ma-rin.
-You can't?

05:32.081 --> 05:33.124
You can't go.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.876
I can't go from just any location.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.128
What kind of lie is so detailed?

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
Did you create your own world too?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.217
You've completely fallen into this world.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.302
Yu So-joon.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.679
This is not normal.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.057
Should we see a doctor?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.893
Ma-rin, do you think
I have nothing better to do?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.564
Okay, then.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.233
What are this week's lottery numbers?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.987
If you get it right this weekend,
I'll accept it.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.155
That's for your good.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.699
Also, I don't mess with the lottery
anymore.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.951
I've already won it three times.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.332
Your acting is so serious.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.459
Don't. It's scary.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.921
Ma-rin, come and sit here.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.924
Don't act so serious.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.857
I've always been a little strange.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.735
You've known that.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.495
I was living a normal life.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.290
How do you think
I managed to succeed like this?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.585
I don't even go into work regularly.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.714
How could I have kept my company
successful like this?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.134
That's what doesn't make sense.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.098
Those things in our house
that don't make sense,

07:13.766 --> 07:15.184
they're not from this world.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.562
So, you're saying

07:19.063 --> 07:20.523
this is for real?

07:21.732 --> 07:22.567
Yes.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.612
This is crazy.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.948
I have a lot of things to resolve
right now.

07:29.490 --> 07:34.162
Honestly, there's nothing grand about it.
I haven't lived in a particular way.

07:35.079 --> 07:35.913
Of course,

07:35.997 --> 07:38.958
I was able to enjoy
having more than others.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.711
But I'm still just me.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.468
My legs are shaking so much.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.599
Who else knows about it?

07:55.683 --> 07:56.517
Ki-doong.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.856
So that's why you go
to his house so often.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.360
But why are you telling me this now?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.989
So I will quit working at Happiness?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.450
So I can protect you.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.161
Even if you feel confused

08:15.620 --> 08:17.288
and burdened by me,

08:18.080 --> 08:20.208
it's better than putting you in danger.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.422
Something bad will happen to me?

08:28.883 --> 08:32.303
What could be bigger
than my husband being a time traveler?

08:41.646 --> 08:44.732
There will be an accident
related to Happiness.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.027
It won't do you any good
to know more.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.695
Trust me for now.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.490
And do what I ask, okay?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.370
I'll think about it.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.830
-Ma-rin.
-I said I'll think about it.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.584
How can I accept all of this at once?

09:04.502 --> 09:08.839
I don't know how much I can believe.
Actually, I can't believe any of it.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.556
MYREITS

09:24.939 --> 09:28.276
27TH: SE-YOUNG'S DAD, HAPPINESS COMPLEX,
MISTER DOO-SHIK

09:39.912 --> 09:42.290
What's on your mind
that you didn't notice I came in?

09:42.373 --> 09:43.332
Hey.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.294
-What did you draw today?
-Nothing.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.754
-Did you do what I asked?
-I did it.

09:49.297 --> 09:53.092
I booked a bus and a condo for the 27th.

09:53.467 --> 09:58.055
I said I would like it
if all of Happiness' employees attended.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.892
He was really happy
getting a group vacation.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.854
So, no Happiness construction
that day, right?

10:04.937 --> 10:07.273
I suppose so.
They'll all be at the workshop trip.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.191
That's good.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.778
Hey. Tell me now.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.531
Why do you need to send them all
on a trip?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.159
What did you see?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.414
Let's talk tonight at your place.
Not here.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.083
You're making me so curious.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.252
Oh, and...

10:30.421 --> 10:32.798
I told Ma-rin.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.052
Well done.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.596
Well done,

10:39.597 --> 10:42.558
but why all of a sudden? Is she okay?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.603
She's probably in shock.
Did she ask for a divorce?

10:46.228 --> 10:47.688
Do you want me to get a divorce?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.231
It will be so funny to write,

10:49.690 --> 10:52.860
"My husband is a time traveler"
on the divorce paper.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.112
It'll be all over the internet.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.532
What if you get dragged off by scientists
and they open up your brain?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.451
Am I an alien or something?

11:05.373 --> 11:08.209
Ma-rin wouldn't look at me
like I'm an alien, right?

11:10.294 --> 11:14.548
I don't think so, but it's very shocking.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.925
There's you to deal with.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.761
But she has to accept
that her future's already set.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.599
Is it that much of a shock?

11:25.434 --> 11:28.062
When I first found out about your secret,

11:28.145 --> 11:33.651
I laughed like this for no reason
because it was so absurd.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.362
I laughed by myself on the street.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.408
I thought,
"Why do I need to live so diligently?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.994
The future is already set,"
in a cynical way.

11:44.078 --> 11:48.833
Then I started saying...
"This is crazy!"

11:48.916 --> 11:50.000
I denied the fact.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.753
It's like you're in a panic.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.422
Anyway.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.341
Even if Ma-rin acts crazy for a bit,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.094
you need to be understanding.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.846
Do you think Ma-rin is you?

12:03.305 --> 12:05.766
She's accepting it better
than I thought she would.

12:07.101 --> 12:07.935
How ridiculous.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.105
This is so ridiculous.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.859
So absurd.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.612
Oh, this is crazy!

12:18.738 --> 12:21.282
It can't be true.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.576
-Isn't that Bap-soon?
-I think so.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.744
Yeah, it's Bap-soon!

12:25.745 --> 12:27.580
Yes, I'm Bap-soon.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.874
-She is!
-Give me rice.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.546
You can post on SNS
that Bap-soon is crazy.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.925
We all have our fate anyhow.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.679
Give me rice.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.266
Attention.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.226
You're all tired, right?

12:49.310 --> 12:50.519
-No.
-Yes.

12:51.103 --> 12:55.566
I know this is very sudden,
but on the 27th of this month,

12:55.733 --> 12:57.818
all Happiness employees
will go on a trip!

13:05.743 --> 13:06.577
Hello.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.287
Oh, Artist Song, you're here.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.456
There must be good news.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.708
Yes. We all get to go on a trip together.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.711
It's on the 27th.
Would you like to go too?

13:15.836 --> 13:18.172
-No. I'm fine.
-Come with us!

13:18.255 --> 13:21.258
Why not? Our largest contributor
is generously covering everything.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.384
You should come too.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.764
Do you mean that anonymous person?

13:26.847 --> 13:27.932
Yes, the anonymous one.

13:28.098 --> 13:31.227
I am very thankful to that person,
thinking of us like this.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.813
-The 27th?
-Yes.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.897
Hi.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.398
Hi.

13:36.899 --> 13:37.942
Hi, Se-young.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.945
Would you like a coffee?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.072
Now?

13:44.990 --> 13:49.161
Aren't you leaving Korea on the 27th?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.454
That's right.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.209
By any chance,

13:55.668 --> 13:57.294
did So-joon say anything else?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.129
Like what?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.006
It just seems weird.

14:01.715 --> 14:05.719
He bought tickets for my parents
to go to Japan with me that day.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.264
He's sending everyone from Happiness
on a trip.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.933
I was wondering
if he had another reason.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.144
I don't know.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.398
It must be because you're leaving.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.859
He thinks everyone will be sad.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.737
He really doesn't need to do this much.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.699
I feel like I'm always receiving.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.455
I heard that you were like family
when he was going through a hard time.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.752
Feels strange.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.756
It was something only between us.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.301
Now, I see he's sharing it with you too.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.094
It's an odd feeling.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.182
Gosh, I really can't say anything.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.603
I can't take away your memories.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.732
Why does it matter
if I know about them now?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.110
The times you two spent together
are yours.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.528
They belong to you.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.533
They won't fade
because I know about them.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.994
Those are such girlish feelings.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.082
Anyway, please take good care of my dad.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.460
Once I'm gone,
you'll be the one closest to him.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.464
He isn't a realist,
so he needs to be lectured a lot.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.138
You said you're leaving
on the 27th, right?

15:31.847 --> 15:34.224
So-ri, I need you to go somewhere with me.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.768
It's an emergency.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.981
You know that place you go to.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.693
That place that always gets it right.
Yes, that one.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.159
I heard
something bad will happen this month.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.828
Please read my future carefully.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.623
What accident?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.124
That's not true.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.585
You have blessings all over you.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.337
You don't see an accident?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.716
What about on the 27th of this month?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.843
You don't see anything?

16:10.302 --> 16:11.261
There's no accident.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.180
Even if there is an accident,

16:13.263 --> 16:15.182
you'll be better off
with the compensation.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.767
It's good. Very good.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.894
You don't need to see this stuff.
Very good.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.187
That's great.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.856
I wish you said
good things about me.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.441
If it looks good, I say so.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.360
I'm just delivering the message.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.277
Then...

16:28.487 --> 16:30.280
This is just a personal question.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.367
You know time slipping?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.953
Like travel
between the present and the future.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.374
If someone claimed to be a time traveler,

16:40.666 --> 16:41.667
would you believe it?

16:42.292 --> 16:43.627
From your point of view?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.338
Oh, there are people like that.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.424
-There are?
-They're attention-seekers.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.927
Outstargram and Facenote.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.221
Tell them to stop all that.
They need to quit.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.349
They will face
a major embarrassment one day.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.227
Jeez. He's not an attention-seeker.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.655
Call everyone with appointments today
and reschedule them all.

17:12.072 --> 17:12.906
I need to pray.

17:13.157 --> 17:13.991
Why?

17:15.325 --> 17:19.163
I couldn't see anything at all,
so I only said good things to her.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.832
How come I couldn't see anything?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.919
Both for Bap-soon and her husband.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.757
It's like they're not alive or dead.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.968
Wow, I've never experienced this before.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.642
MADAM

17:46.440 --> 17:48.317
Hello, Madam.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.404
Step outside.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.614
No.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.199
Yes, please go on.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.076
Step outside.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.995
No, it's nothing. Yes.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.123
Oh, that's what this is about?

18:03.373 --> 18:06.418
We've completed the contract on Jangho.
No need to worry.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.129
You only need to wait and make money.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.633
How would he pay up 9 billion won?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.135
What if he ends up in prison?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.014
It can't be...

18:19.264 --> 18:22.226
We do have plans
to get rid of our smaller buildings.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.436
You must not spread a rumor.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.606
When are you thinking of purchasing?

18:27.689 --> 18:31.527
I could give you the contract money
tomorrow if you wanted.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.736
It's not a problem.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.989
No way. That can't be.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.373
You don't greet me?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.416
Hello, Director Wang.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
I have to force it out of you.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.462
Forget it.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.094
-I seem like an old man, right?
-Not at all.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.430
I shouldn't be so strict, should I?

19:02.182 --> 19:03.183
Wait,

19:03.642 --> 19:06.603
do you have time for coffee with me?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.438
Sounds good. Let's go.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.190
-This way.
-What is it? Tell me.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.567
-Let's go and talk.
-Where?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.735
Why have coffee if I could say it here?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.072
Your friend is a movie director?

19:17.656 --> 19:21.076
No, he's getting ready to debut.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.121
He wants to invest with us
and keeps asking me questions.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.039
It's not possible, is it?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.876
Actually, it's possible.

19:29.251 --> 19:34.339
Buildings worth tens of billions of won
can take a year to complete the payment.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.383
First, you take the contract deposit.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.637
Until the full payment comes through,
you keep it a secret project.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.639
Make sure everyone keeps quiet.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.852
So, no one would know
that a contract has been signed?

19:46.935 --> 19:47.769
Of course.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.689
Steal the company's seal
and sign a secret contract.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.358
Then run off with the deposit.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.360
That alone is several billion won.

19:55.444 --> 19:59.114
I know several guys who did that and ran.

19:59.406 --> 20:04.244
Though they are now in jail
or in Vietnam or the Philippines.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.123
So it's possible like that.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.005
Why do we need to go to my place to talk?

20:15.839 --> 20:17.925
-You're making me nervous.
-Let's just go.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.012
Is it really bad?

20:23.263 --> 20:24.097
Yes.

20:24.431 --> 20:28.352
If it's really that bad, can I not know?

20:31.647 --> 20:35.192
It's just that I feel uncomfortable
about knowing about the future.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.238
They say it's better not to know.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.909
I didn't want to tell you either,
but I need your help this time.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.286
There's something we need to resolve.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.164
You must be heading home.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.250
Yes, we are.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.378
Am I interrupting your conversation?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.129
-No.
-Not at all.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.089
Let's get on.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.349
I hear you're busy lately.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.517
Yes, I am.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.229
Isn't it good for the company
for me to be busy?

21:12.813 --> 21:14.523
Still, please attend the meetings.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.108
People are talking.

21:16.191 --> 21:20.153
I'm making more of an effort
to attend than you are, Chairman.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.239
You should.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.867
Because you are not me.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.082
-I was only making a joke.
-You weren't being sarcastic?

21:39.756 --> 21:41.633
What's going to happen to Se-young's dad?

21:43.010 --> 21:45.429
Don't worry. It hasn't happened yet.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.763
You're telling me...

21:50.642 --> 21:52.352
it's about to...

21:53.020 --> 21:55.897
We can stop it from happening.
That's why I'm telling you.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.525
Hey, Ki-doong.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.320
Why are you acting so weird?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.989
He's still alive. Calm down.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.409
What are you planning to do?

22:09.494 --> 22:12.914
I'm planning to send him away
with Se-young on the 27th.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.583
What if he dies in Japan?

22:14.958 --> 22:17.044
We don't know he's going to die there.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.462
Hey.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.924
This is so hard for me to hear.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.429
Fate?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.639
There's no such thing.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.725
We just need to stop the accident.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.354
The news article said
it was a safety accident at the site.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.482
Whether it was an accident
or on purpose,

22:38.732 --> 22:40.609
he will be okay once he leaves Korea.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.112
What do you mean, "on purpose"?
Are you saying it could be murder?

22:46.073 --> 22:49.368
I'm not sure,
but there is someone I'm suspicious of.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.244
<i>Are you suspicious of me?</i>

22:52.079 --> 22:52.913
Hey.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.625
I came here to stop the accident.
To try to help.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.127
I'm not sure of anything.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.964
He has no reason to do it.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.509
Would you tell me
so that I can understand?

23:05.717 --> 23:06.968
You don't know him.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.055
Anyway, I'll do the rest.

23:10.389 --> 23:14.393
-Go to the construction site on that day.
-You said Se-young's dad's going to Japan.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.604
There could be other circumstances.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.689
You never know what could happen.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.191
Shouldn't you know, though?

23:21.483 --> 23:25.153
If there really is a culprit,
he could show up there that day.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.364
Go there and watch over it.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.281
So-joon,

23:28.990 --> 23:30.659
let me ask you this one favor.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.078
Can't you go to the future
and confirm?

23:33.161 --> 23:35.038
Then things will be simple, right?

23:38.542 --> 23:39.960
The person that I suspect...

23:41.545 --> 23:43.171
is a time traveler like me.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.595
If he finds out that I know everything,

23:51.054 --> 23:53.056
he could change his plan.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.560
Of course, I can't make any conclusions.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.313
But Se-young's dad's life is on the line.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.941
I'm considering all the possibilities.

24:12.075 --> 24:12.909
Okay.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.830
You do see the future.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.666
What's there to worry about, right?

24:20.792 --> 24:23.044
Yeah. Don't worry.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.922
Ki-doong.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.258
Ki-doong, aren't you there?

24:30.635 --> 24:31.470
Ki-doong.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.563
Why didn't you say anything?

24:43.773 --> 24:44.858
Can I come in?

24:46.234 --> 24:47.068
Yeah.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.621
Hi.

24:57.704 --> 24:58.538
Hello.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.875
Oh, right.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.836
You two should talk.
I need to get some air.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.296
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.934
This is overwhelming.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.562
You brought these from the future?

25:23.730 --> 25:24.564
Yeah.

25:25.899 --> 25:29.402
I would be less shocked
to see a pile of porn here.

25:33.823 --> 25:34.783
All right.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.910
I'll leave.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.372
It's just that it's Ki-doong's place.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.250
It's also the place
you live half the time.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.172
I thought there'd be a door
to a fourth dimension.

25:50.799 --> 25:51.925
Nothing like that?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.135
No.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.223
There's not much, then.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.141
Let's go.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.066
Okay.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.026
I accept it.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.613
Now that I've seen it,

26:13.822 --> 26:15.365
I have to admit it's real.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.289
I parked over there.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.040
Let's walk a little

26:24.541 --> 26:26.001
so that I can clear my head.

26:29.796 --> 26:30.630
Oh.

26:31.798 --> 26:35.343
I visited a psychic
who is supposed to be very good.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.012
You visited where?

26:38.054 --> 26:38.888
A psychic.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.226
She said we have such good luck

26:43.560 --> 26:45.061
that nothing bad will happen.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.317
I'm not so sure if she really is so good.

26:50.859 --> 26:54.237
Why would you go to a place like that?
How would ghosts know the future?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.949
Only time travelers
can know the future?

26:58.908 --> 27:01.369
People like you exist. Why not ghosts?

27:02.245 --> 27:03.246
Don't be biased.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.666
Why would you compare me to a ghost?

27:14.090 --> 27:16.676
-Make sure to keep this in your wallet.
-What is it?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.470
It will protect you from bad things.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.471
A talisman?

27:24.017 --> 27:25.477
What's wrong with a talisman?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.229
I don't know the future,

27:28.396 --> 27:29.814
so I trust and rely on this.

27:34.027 --> 27:37.280
You may think I'm silly.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.076
but this is my way of showing
my concern for you.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.454
That is more than enough for me.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.831
I don't expect anything more.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.960
Can't you expect more from me?

27:56.966 --> 27:59.260
Do you know what really makes me feel
taken aback?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.098
Honestly...

28:04.057 --> 28:07.477
I still haven't quite grasped the reality,
feeling like I'm dreaming.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.356
I feel lost, but I don't really feel this.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.317
Yeah,

28:15.235 --> 28:17.028
if this is all true...

28:17.821 --> 28:20.448
it could be better
than winning the lottery.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.076
But I don't really like it.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.746
It's like you're living
in another world.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.376
I'm still the same.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.881
I'm using all my imagination,
but I can't understand it.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.511
I just saw things with my own eyes,
but I can't just accept it.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.140
That's normal.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.728
But even if I were an average guy,

28:50.645 --> 28:53.565
wouldn't it still be difficult
to understand each other?

28:55.859 --> 28:58.319
We're going to live together
for another 70 years.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.322
Wouldn't it be boring
if we knew everything now?

29:03.616 --> 29:06.619
I understand you being needy
because you like me.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.913
But don't be in a rush.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.083
You can actually joke right now?

29:18.965 --> 29:21.676
How do you feel about
becoming a time traveler's wife?

29:23.261 --> 29:24.429
It feels like crap.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.598
Isn't he so incredibly charming?

29:27.390 --> 29:28.308
Not really.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.150
It's the 27th, isn't it?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.320
The day something bad will happen.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.198
Yeah.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.201
What will happen?

29:53.666 --> 29:54.918
Se-young's father is...

29:56.252 --> 29:57.253
going to get injured.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.591
Don't worry. It can be prevented.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.968
It can be prevented?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.679
Of course, I know everything about it.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.307
Still, you never know.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.851
That's why I asked you to quit.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.188
I'd like it if you weren't
near the construction site.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.858
The accident is at the construction site?

30:18.942 --> 30:20.777
It's not going to happen.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.614
Should I give this talisman
to Se-young's dad?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.370
Never mind. I'll keep it.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.706
It can be prevented, right?

30:34.916 --> 30:36.417
30% for the contract deposit?

30:37.168 --> 30:38.837
I was thinking 20%.

30:38.920 --> 30:43.216
No, 30% is normal
for a building like this.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.217
Instead,

30:44.843 --> 30:48.012
we can give you one year
for the rest of the payment.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.138
What do you think?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.392
Well, I'll buy it.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.102
I need to while I have the chance.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.565
Then I'll prepare the contract.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.109
Let's do it,
before anyone has a change of heart.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.902
-President Choi.
-Yes.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.238
I would like it

31:06.155 --> 31:08.950
if you kept this deal a secret
for about a year.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.034
This is because

31:10.410 --> 31:14.455
only a few ace employees know about it,
even in our company.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.583
I won't even tell my wife.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.169
Why are you sitting at the corner?
You're making me nervous.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.302
What are you doing?

31:27.844 --> 31:29.262
You're not sleeping?

31:29.470 --> 31:30.597
Come to bed.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.892
Will anyone acknowledge you
for working that hard?

31:35.435 --> 31:36.269
Gun-sook.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.939
Before, you said you wanted to emigrate.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.190
America?

31:45.320 --> 31:48.489
No, instead of America, let's go...

31:49.949 --> 31:51.117
to Vietnam.

31:51.492 --> 31:52.327
Huh?

31:53.036 --> 31:54.203
As in Vietnamese Pho?

31:54.287 --> 31:56.039
Get ready with whatever you need

31:57.206 --> 31:59.208
so that we can leave in three months.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.502
Don't tell anyone yet.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.089
Especially, don't tell Ma-rin.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.383
It's because the company doesn't know yet.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.802
What is this shocking news

32:10.511 --> 32:11.804
in the middle of the night?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.806
I don't want to.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.268
Like it or not, we have to go.

32:17.352 --> 32:21.230
You didn't even discuss it with me.
This is so shocking.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.316
I'm not going.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.401
I'm not going, no matter what.
Go without me.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.402
Gun-sook.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.656
if I say let's go, just say yes.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.785
Just do what I ask you to, would you?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.537
Things are so hard for me right now.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.916
You're all I have. You know that, right?

32:40.917 --> 32:44.128
You said you wanted to go abroad.
You even said, "Let's emigrate."

32:44.462 --> 32:46.255
So let's go to Vietnam.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.049
I meant America.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.177
Will he really be okay?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.846
Nothing will happen.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.520
Do you remember when we first met?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.064
When?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.233
On the subway?

33:05.942 --> 33:06.776
No,

33:07.860 --> 33:10.154
the day I talked to you on the street.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.241
-Excuse me.
-What are you doing?

33:13.324 --> 33:16.536
You're so beautiful.
I just want to have coffee with you.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.834
<i>Actually, you were about to get</i>
<i>into an accident.</i>

33:23.960 --> 33:25.670
I delayed you and stopped it.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.131
I'm showing off after the fact.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.925
What? I thought you fell for me.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.635
I'm telling you I saved you.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.180
Aren't you touched by that?
It's like a movie.

33:37.098 --> 33:40.351
-I didn't see it, how can I believe it?
-I'm telling you, it's true.

33:41.477 --> 33:42.395
Anyway,

33:43.104 --> 33:44.230
just like that time...

33:45.023 --> 33:47.150
Se-young's dad can be saved this time.

33:47.775 --> 33:48.985
You don't have to worry.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.615
What?

33:55.158 --> 33:56.576
Did you really save me?

33:57.493 --> 33:58.327
Yeah.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.497
You're really an amazing man.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.046
Are you a real person?

34:12.675 --> 34:15.720
I am not actually a person.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.139
Hey,

34:18.473 --> 34:20.099
can't you tell by my humanity?

34:20.183 --> 34:21.517
-What was that?
-I'm human.

34:23.352 --> 34:26.606
You are very human,
but you can travel to the future.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.274
Yeah.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.402
Is that your only superpower?

34:31.861 --> 34:34.614
It's not a superpower. But...

34:35.531 --> 34:36.365
yes.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.037
You're really an amazing man.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.373
HAPPINESS FOR HUMANITY
KOREA

34:49.504 --> 34:50.338
Se-young.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.424
Did you come to see me?

34:55.259 --> 34:57.303
-That looks heavy. Let me help.
-It's fine.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.055
Where are you going? I'll drive you.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.182
I'm going home. I have lots to do.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.101
Where is your car parked? I'll drive.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.353
Why? I said I'm going alone.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.813
Stop it, already.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.691
Did I commit a crime
that I deserve to die for?

35:11.275 --> 35:12.735
Should I apologize for that day?

35:13.236 --> 35:16.572
I'm sorry and forget it happened.
Does that make you feel better?

35:17.532 --> 35:19.826
I feel awkward and uncomfortable.
What can I do?

35:19.909 --> 35:22.787
I won't use that day as an excuse
to try anything. Don't worry.

35:23.162 --> 35:23.996
I just...

35:25.206 --> 35:28.501
came to say goodbye,
as I can't go to the airport tomorrow,

35:32.380 --> 35:33.214
So, just go.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.135
Make sure there's no need to come back.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.929
Have fun and live a good life.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.305
Okay?

35:41.889 --> 35:45.893
I'll think not seeing each other often is
good for the both of us.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.646
Why are you being so emotional?

35:57.113 --> 35:57.947
Get that for me.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.161
My ear.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.164
Yeah, Dad.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.207
I'm leaving now.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.709
Where are you?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.919
I'm here to meet So-joon.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.463
I should thank him in person.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.926
Send me a text
if you need me to buy you anything.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.096
Soy milk? Milk.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.684
Make sure you pack everything you need.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.978
<i>Hello. I'm Kim Yong-jin.</i>

36:29.061 --> 36:30.146
Hello.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.981
You work for a great company.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.110
I'm just going to meet So-joon
and I'll be right there.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.570
Okay, I got it.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.113
Okay.

36:40.406 --> 36:43.034
Consider it a vacation with the family

36:43.117 --> 36:44.410
and take a nice break.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.079
Spend some quality time together.

36:47.538 --> 36:51.959
Se-young's mom is going on the trip
with the Happiness employees.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.837
She thinks she'll have a hard time,

36:55.171 --> 36:56.714
leaving Se-young alone in Japan.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.550
Se-young is 30 years old now.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.135
Yeah.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.889
Try your best to have many kids.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.766
I regret so much

37:07.058 --> 37:08.434
having only one.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.104
Yes, I'll do my best.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.025
When did you grow up so much?

37:16.692 --> 37:17.985
Time is so scary.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.033
Thank you, So-joon.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.911
I'm thankful for you thinking of me.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.373
And taking care
of the Happiness family too.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.085
No,

37:34.669 --> 37:35.962
I'm more thankful to you.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.799
So proud.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.386
Take care of yourself.

37:43.970 --> 37:44.845
I will.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.394
You don't have to see me out. Go in.

37:51.477 --> 37:54.438
It's just to the front door.
I don't have much to do anyway.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.482
Oh yeah.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.442
There's a company called Sungjin

37:58.859 --> 38:01.988
that rents from a building of yours.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.948
Why? I think I've heard of them.

38:04.198 --> 38:06.492
A classmate of mine, President Choi,
told me

38:07.118 --> 38:08.661
he's buying that building.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.080
He was showing off so much.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.540
Really?

38:13.082 --> 38:15.668
We're not selling any buildings
for a while, though.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.336
Really?

38:17.461 --> 38:18.713
Are you not mistaken?

38:29.098 --> 38:29.932
Well...

38:30.016 --> 38:32.184
It's been a long time
since you took a vacation.

38:32.601 --> 38:33.811
It has been a long time.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.980
You should go on a vacation too.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.107
I want to follow you.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.693
Gosh, no thank you.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.403
Bye.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.362
Okay.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.072
Okay.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.574
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.413
So-joon.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.498
Yu So-joon.

38:55.249 --> 38:56.083
Hi.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.794
Se-young's dad was just here.
You should say goodbye.

39:00.546 --> 39:01.756
No, it's okay.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.383
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.303
I'll go see him after we get past this.

39:07.970 --> 39:08.804
Okay.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.057
Hey,

39:11.891 --> 39:14.268
how did you deal
with this frustration on your own?

39:14.977 --> 39:16.937
Do you understand
the burden of my life now?

39:18.564 --> 39:19.690
It is quite something.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.859
If it weren't for Se-young,

39:22.526 --> 39:23.569
I wouldn't do it again.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.530
Still, this is an opportunity
money can't buy.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.408
Let's not complain

39:29.909 --> 39:31.410
and try to get past this.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.873
Okay. I just need to watch
over the construction site, right?

39:36.499 --> 39:37.333
Yeah.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.629
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.762
OCTOBER 27, 2016
EXPECTED DAY OF DEATH OF SHIN SUNG-KYU

39:59.939 --> 40:01.232
It'll be fine.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.442
Don't you worry.

40:04.944 --> 40:05.945
I'll protect you.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.166
Today's the day.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.293
<i>You're going to the airport?</i>

40:22.002 --> 40:24.004
You can't. You have to stay home today.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.091
I'll call you
once I see the board director leave.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.175
You can't.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.219
That will make you feel better too.

40:34.056 --> 40:37.017
I'll feel more nervous if I sit at home.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.228
As you said,

40:39.979 --> 40:43.315
if the director leaves on his flight,
then nothing will happen.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.944
I will make sure he gets on that flight,

40:47.027 --> 40:48.320
so don't worry.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.739
I'll go to the airport
and come right back.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.372
You're not coming with me?

40:58.706 --> 41:03.127
I'll drop by to give the employees
some money for beer.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.045
Then I'll head to the airport.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.798
It's been years
since they've been on a trip,

41:07.882 --> 41:09.425
so I should say goodbye.

41:09.508 --> 41:12.219
Their trip is paid for.
Why do you need to give them money?

41:12.303 --> 41:13.971
Come with me. It's less of a hassle.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.473
Just go on without me.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.851
I'll be there soon to be your bodyguard.

41:19.852 --> 41:20.686
Okay.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.106
You're being a baby today. Get going.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.442
See you later.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.075
Se-young.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.037
You really didn't need to come.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.331
-Do you hate me that much?
-No.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.250
Where is your father?

41:43.626 --> 41:45.085
He has things to take care of.

41:45.711 --> 41:46.545
Pack the alcohol.

41:46.629 --> 41:49.131
How long has it been
since you've gone on a trip?

41:49.215 --> 41:50.883
-I know.
-Wow!

41:50.966 --> 41:52.718
You shouldn't have.

41:52.801 --> 41:53.844
Thank you.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.056
I should be the one to thank you.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.601
Don't drink too much on your trip.

42:00.684 --> 42:01.685
-Yes, sir.
-Yes!

42:01.769 --> 42:04.104
It would have been great
if you came along too.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.022
I know.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.024
What's taking so long?

42:07.358 --> 42:08.943
Get to the airport, Honey.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.903
Who is that beautiful person?

42:11.820 --> 42:13.322
All right, I'll go now.

42:14.073 --> 42:16.450
She's just upset that Se-young is leaving.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.702
-Let's go.
-You should all go.

42:18.786 --> 42:19.620
Go first.

42:20.454 --> 42:23.457
<i>I heard something strange from my friend.</i>

42:24.250 --> 42:27.336
<i>He asked me several times</i>
<i>if you really work at Myreits.</i>

42:27.920 --> 42:30.381
<i>He's like family</i>
<i>with the chairman of Myreits.</i>

42:30.756 --> 42:33.467
<i>The chairman told him</i>
<i>he has no plans to sell the building.</i>

42:47.606 --> 42:50.526
Excuse me! D... Director!

42:53.737 --> 42:56.991
Aren't you the director of the board
for Happiness?

42:57.491 --> 42:59.368
Yes. Who are you?

42:59.785 --> 43:05.082
I met you a while back in a restaurant
with President Choi if you recall.

43:05.165 --> 43:08.377
-I'm a director at Myreits.
<i>-</i>Oh, yes.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.756
I was planning on contacting you
about donating to Happiness.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.841
And I ran into you.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.467
How amazing.

43:15.551 --> 43:16.427
It's...

43:17.928 --> 43:18.762
Hold on.

43:20.681 --> 43:23.225
I'm running a little late.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.479
Looks like you're going somewhere.
Actually, I...

43:29.023 --> 43:30.316
am on my way to the airport.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.611
Oh, I'm on my way there too.

43:33.694 --> 43:34.778
Oh, really?

43:54.214 --> 43:55.257
Is anyone there?

43:59.928 --> 44:01.055
Nobody's here?

44:06.101 --> 44:07.686
Did you come for my journal?

44:12.524 --> 44:13.442
Did you find out?

44:14.526 --> 44:17.446
You should've told me if you knew.

44:17.780 --> 44:18.739
I came for no reason.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.824
What were you going to do
after stealing it?

44:21.116 --> 44:22.368
Are you interested in me?

44:23.327 --> 44:25.454
Why would I be so interested in you?

44:25.537 --> 44:27.122
I must be lonely.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.291
You're stealing my journal

44:29.625 --> 44:31.335
to hide my future from me.

44:32.211 --> 44:34.046
You don't want me to know
what'll happen.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.966
You know very well.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.470
I told you. Not knowing is good for you.

44:41.553 --> 44:42.721
Why won't you listen?

44:42.805 --> 44:44.598
What, exactly, should I not know?

44:45.724 --> 44:46.642
Today's accident?

44:47.851 --> 44:50.562
You'll steal my journal
and go to the construction site.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.606
Because you know about today's accident.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.402
Is that what you tried to hide from me?

44:57.319 --> 44:59.780
What? I was thinking about something else.

44:59.863 --> 45:02.533
Accident? What accident? Me?

45:02.616 --> 45:04.118
Why are you being like this?

45:04.576 --> 45:06.620
You should try a lie that works.

45:07.663 --> 45:08.789
I saw everything myself.

45:09.123 --> 45:12.167
I don't know what you saw
when you went to the future.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.962
If you say this over something
I haven't done yet,

45:15.045 --> 45:16.588
how am I supposed to feel?

45:16.672 --> 45:18.465
This is what is known as irony.

45:19.091 --> 45:20.509
I'm very serious right now.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.555
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

45:26.223 --> 45:27.307
Go somewhere with me.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.437
I'm really busy today. Let's go next time.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.190
I have to stop the accident
from happening today.

45:36.358 --> 45:39.319
It would be best to get you
as far away as I can.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.490
Are you suspecting me?

45:44.575 --> 45:45.659
You think I did it?

45:45.743 --> 45:46.869
Look at this.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.955
You knew all about today's accident.

45:50.956 --> 45:51.915
This is why...

45:53.292 --> 45:55.085
I can't help but suspect you.

45:56.378 --> 45:57.546
Hey, So-joon.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.506
Don't say my name.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.967
-So-joon.
-I said don't say my name!

46:05.179 --> 46:06.638
I told you to trust me.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.224
I told you not to doubt me.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.603
I'm on your side.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.688
Why were you
at the scene of the accident?

46:15.773 --> 46:19.610
You knew all about today's accident.
Why did you hide it?

46:20.944 --> 46:23.697
Why did you hide it and why did you lie?

46:28.035 --> 46:28.869
You know what?

46:29.787 --> 46:30.913
I really...

46:32.414 --> 46:34.541
hope that you aren't the culprit.

46:36.043 --> 46:36.877
Look at me.

46:40.547 --> 46:41.507
It's not me, right?

46:43.467 --> 46:44.843
I don't have time right now.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.553
I'm leaving. Don't stop me.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.847
-Where are you going?
-Today's accident!

46:49.056 --> 46:51.266
I'll take care of it on your behalf.
So stay put.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.435
He's not in Korea.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.437
I sent him to Japan.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.611
Did... did you really? You're positive?

47:02.694 --> 47:05.906
He's at the airport and he'll board soon.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.951
He won't show up
at the construction site today.

47:10.452 --> 47:13.080
He... he will not die.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.165
You're sure, right?

47:17.793 --> 47:18.627
And...

47:20.462 --> 47:21.755
I can't trust you.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.508
If you really want to help me,

47:24.842 --> 47:26.093
do what I ask of you.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.012
I'm sure nothing will happen today.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.599
But it's still better to be thorough.

47:34.309 --> 47:35.352
So come with me.

47:41.191 --> 47:45.362
NAMYEONG STATION

47:48.240 --> 47:49.157
Hey.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.411
Do you think you can stop today's accident

47:52.953 --> 47:54.496
if you send me to the future?

47:54.580 --> 47:55.789
Let's travel in silence.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.001
Fine.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.800
You used to grab my hand and beg me

48:06.884 --> 48:08.427
to go on the subway with you.

48:09.428 --> 48:10.387
You've changed.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.140
What kind of watch do you wear?

48:13.223 --> 48:15.017
Why are you touching me like that? Hey!

48:16.518 --> 48:17.603
What are you doing?

48:18.896 --> 48:21.148
We can't hold hands like we used to.

48:21.773 --> 48:23.775
Okay, I'll go. Unlock this.

48:24.067 --> 48:26.069
Once I know you're innocent...

48:27.237 --> 48:28.447
we can talk about it then.

48:31.283 --> 48:32.117
<i>All right.</i>

48:33.035 --> 48:36.496
<i>It's not bad to keep you away</i>
<i>from the accident site.</i>

48:38.373 --> 48:40.834
<i>I have to keep you from knowing</i>

48:42.044 --> 48:43.670
<i>Kim Yong-jin is the culprit.</i>

48:50.510 --> 48:51.720
Did something happen?

48:53.889 --> 48:55.557
I'll try calling him again.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.566
Sounds like my phone.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.570
Oh, I'm so disorganized.

49:09.279 --> 49:10.113
Don't get it.

49:12.574 --> 49:13.408
Pardon?

49:14.368 --> 49:16.495
Why don't we have a chat first?

49:21.750 --> 49:24.920
Oh, this isn't the way to the airport.

49:25.879 --> 49:28.048
You said some strange things
to President Choi.

49:33.512 --> 49:36.264
Just stop here.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.976
It would be better to go on my own.

49:41.853 --> 49:42.771
Let's make a deal.

49:45.732 --> 49:48.694
If you keep your mouth shut,
you could have a great deal of money.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.696
How much will do?

49:51.238 --> 49:53.865
So, you did con President Choi
with the building contract.

49:53.949 --> 49:56.952
Yes, so how much will be enough?

49:58.036 --> 50:00.038
If we make a deal today...

50:00.122 --> 50:02.290
Look, just pull over here

50:02.916 --> 50:04.167
before things get worse.

50:04.918 --> 50:05.752
Now.

50:07.504 --> 50:08.839
-Are you a gangster?
-What!

50:09.047 --> 50:10.298
Why am I a gangster?

50:10.674 --> 50:13.760
I am offering you a deal like a gentleman.

50:13.844 --> 50:17.014
I am not a gangster
or some sort of a street thug.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.975
You want to put the brakes on my life.
Is that it?

50:20.809 --> 50:22.394
Try it, then.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.771
I'm tired and exhausted too.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.566
I really do need to go in now.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.777
What's he doing?
Why is he not picking up the phone?

50:32.154 --> 50:33.530
Why don't you go in, Se-young?

50:34.614 --> 50:36.366
I'll try looking for him.

50:36.658 --> 50:38.035
We don't know where he is.

50:38.660 --> 50:40.746
He could be lost in the airport.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.373
I'll try looking for him.

50:44.082 --> 50:45.459
Call me if he does arrive.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.420
Please help me out then.

50:49.796 --> 50:50.630
Thanks.

50:51.131 --> 50:52.090
Go in.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.018
Why isn't he picking up?

51:03.935 --> 51:06.688
So-joon, Se-young's father didn't come
to the airport.

51:07.230 --> 51:11.109
You don't think anything's wrong, do you?
I'm going to the construction site now.

51:11.526 --> 51:13.070
Call me as soon as you hear this.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.655
I'm so scared.

51:27.834 --> 51:30.337
Why did we have to come to winter?

51:31.338 --> 51:32.631
It's freaking cold.

51:34.341 --> 51:35.675
I'll ask you one last time.

51:36.384 --> 51:38.053
Why did you go to the accident site?

51:40.847 --> 51:42.974
I didn't want you
involved in the accident.

51:44.267 --> 51:45.102
Why?

51:47.771 --> 51:50.315
You kept digging here and there
into the future.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.567
The more you try to stop this accident...

51:55.946 --> 51:57.739
the worse things could be.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.452
I don't know what you're saying.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.038
I'll live my life the way I see fit.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.416
I don't know why you suddenly care

52:08.959 --> 52:10.085
so much about me.

52:11.586 --> 52:13.171
Because I feel like you're my son.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.759
Do you think those words suit you?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.428
You said you have a daughter.

52:20.679 --> 52:22.180
Be good to your daughter.

52:27.811 --> 52:28.645
Do you think

52:30.021 --> 52:33.150
I could do something so horrific?

52:35.610 --> 52:36.444
No.

52:37.404 --> 52:39.406
That's why my head is going to explode.

52:47.956 --> 52:49.416
If nothing happens today,

52:49.958 --> 52:51.209
this article will change.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.504
I'll take my time thinking after that...

52:56.423 --> 52:57.591
regarding you.

53:01.052 --> 53:04.264
SHIN SUNG-KYU, DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD
AT HAPPINESS HAS DIED.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.183
Nothing changed.

53:14.524 --> 53:17.068
OCTOBER 27, 2016, PRESENT

53:33.418 --> 53:34.252
What is this?

53:36.713 --> 53:38.006
Why is she here?

53:39.132 --> 53:40.967
Seriously? What the heck?

53:41.343 --> 53:42.844
Damn it!

53:43.720 --> 53:45.931
Stay still! Don't move!

53:47.265 --> 53:48.308
Director!

53:49.392 --> 53:50.435
Are you here?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.563
Ma-rin!  Ma-rin!

53:55.607 --> 53:58.693
No, you can't be here today.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.112
Have you seen Director Shin?

54:01.446 --> 54:02.280
What?

54:03.073 --> 54:04.449
He didn't come to the airport.

54:04.699 --> 54:06.034
Se-young came alone.

54:08.119 --> 54:08.954
What should we do?

54:11.873 --> 54:12.916
He can't come here.

54:15.043 --> 54:16.044
Did you check?

54:17.712 --> 54:20.382
WINTER 2016, FUTURE

54:20.590 --> 54:21.424
It worked.

54:21.758 --> 54:22.592
It disappeared.

54:24.594 --> 54:25.428
It disappeared?

54:28.682 --> 54:29.599
Did it work out?

54:40.110 --> 54:41.987
What? What's this?

54:45.282 --> 54:47.909
House site at Hwakyung-dong?

54:49.577 --> 54:50.662
The location...

54:52.580 --> 54:54.374
The location changed.

54:55.709 --> 54:56.876
The location changed.

54:59.254 --> 55:00.380
So-joon. Wait.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.465
Even if you go now,

55:02.841 --> 55:04.384
you can't stop it.

55:04.467 --> 55:06.594
What? The location changed.

55:06.678 --> 55:07.887
You can't do anything.

55:08.638 --> 55:10.098
I said I'd try to help.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.851
I already expected
we wouldn't be able to change it.

55:12.934 --> 55:14.436
A person lives and dies.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.438
It's not something we can control.

55:16.521 --> 55:19.024
What are you talking about?
We still have time.

55:19.607 --> 55:20.775
I can stop it.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.152
I can!

55:22.235 --> 55:23.278
So-joon!

55:24.195 --> 55:25.030
Hey, So-joon!

55:27.115 --> 55:30.368
OCTOBER 27, 2016, PRESENT

55:58.521 --> 56:00.523
Hey... Let's...

56:02.150 --> 56:03.109
negotiate.

56:03.443 --> 56:04.444
Damn it.

56:04.903 --> 56:05.737
I will say...

56:07.280 --> 56:09.240
-I don't know--
-Damn it!

56:09.657 --> 56:13.078
I want to trust
that you don't know anything. I do.

56:13.161 --> 56:14.954
But how can I believe that?

56:17.791 --> 56:21.211
I just came to make a deal.

56:21.294 --> 56:22.170
Yes, so...

56:22.253 --> 56:24.130
I only came to make a deal.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.548
Yes, so...

56:25.632 --> 56:28.676
So, what? Why are you doing this to me?

56:28.760 --> 56:31.012
You ruined everything!

56:31.971 --> 56:33.431
Must I kill you?

56:34.265 --> 56:36.184
It's a construction site in Hwakyung-dong.

56:36.267 --> 56:38.895
I'm headed there now.
You need to go too. There's no time.

56:41.606 --> 56:43.525
What does he mean
the location has changed?

56:43.608 --> 56:46.528
I don't know what he's saying either.

56:46.611 --> 56:49.030
He says to go to a construction site
in Hwakyung-dong.

56:50.323 --> 56:52.450
Yes, they are building houses there too.

56:53.201 --> 56:54.285
Hwakyung-dong houses.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.413
That's where he is?

56:58.456 --> 56:59.916
I think we need to go there.

56:59.999 --> 57:00.875
-Let's go.
-Okay.

57:15.932 --> 57:16.766
Mister.

57:17.809 --> 57:20.979
Oh no! Director Shin.

57:21.062 --> 57:23.231
-Director!
-Mister, Mister!

57:23.565 --> 57:24.774
Mister, wake up. Mister!

57:25.567 --> 57:26.401
Director!

57:27.819 --> 57:30.321
There's so much blood. Is anyone here?

57:33.491 --> 57:36.286
Is anyone here? Please wake up!

57:36.369 --> 57:37.579
Help us.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.127
-Mister.
-Is anyone out there?

57:44.461 --> 57:45.503
Is anyone here?

57:46.463 --> 57:48.715
-Help!
-Please help us.

57:50.091 --> 57:50.925
Help!

57:51.134 --> 57:52.177
Please save him.

57:53.094 --> 57:55.305
So-joon. What should I do?

57:55.722 --> 57:58.099
Is anyone here? Help me.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.602
-Please help!
-Help, here.

58:02.604 --> 58:03.563
So-joon.

58:10.904 --> 58:12.697
What do I do? What do I do?

58:12.780 --> 58:14.240
What do we do about him?

58:19.037 --> 58:20.413
What should we do?

58:21.706 --> 58:22.582
What now?

58:26.586 --> 58:28.171
What do we do?

58:38.056 --> 58:38.890
Coming.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.147
Oh, you scared me!

58:46.523 --> 58:47.857
I was about to open the door.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.653
Say something!

58:55.073 --> 58:56.991
Why is he acting like that these days?

58:57.450 --> 58:58.743
Are you looking down on me?

58:59.202 --> 59:00.537
Am I invisible?

59:02.205 --> 59:03.039
Jeez.

59:06.668 --> 59:08.127
You think this is a restaurant?

59:10.338 --> 59:12.048
You just throw your shoes anywhere.

59:16.469 --> 59:17.303
What's this?

59:18.513 --> 59:19.639
Where has he been?

59:25.562 --> 59:28.648
<i>Kim Yong-jin embezzled money</i>
<i>from the company.</i>

59:29.649 --> 59:34.070
He was destined to kill the director
of the board at Happiness who found out.

59:35.613 --> 59:39.659
<i>I tried to get him to leave Myreits,</i>
<i>but I failed.</i>

59:41.578 --> 59:45.206
<i>The circumstances were different,</i>
<i>but he became a murderer in the end.</i>

59:49.627 --> 59:52.422
However, I cannot tell So-joon this fact.

59:54.674 --> 59:55.508
Because...

59:57.594 --> 1:00:00.763
my Ma-rin and So-joon...

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:05.101
will both be in danger if they know.

1:00:19.991 --> 1:00:21.993
MEMORIAL AT 201: SHIN SUNG-KYU (57)

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:16.798
Let's go. Se-young's waiting.

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:18.508
Oh, it's So-joon.

1:01:19.217 --> 1:01:21.010
Chairman Yu.

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:22.428
What are you doing?

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.249
Have a cup of water, at least.

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:55.670
You didn't eat yesterday or today.

1:01:56.921 --> 1:01:57.755
Thanks.

1:01:59.090 --> 1:02:01.592
You must be tired too. Go home and rest.

1:02:04.178 --> 1:02:06.264
How can I, when you're here like this?

1:02:09.267 --> 1:02:11.894
Don't worry about me and go rest.

1:02:13.479 --> 1:02:15.189
You must have worried a lot.

1:02:16.232 --> 1:02:17.066
I'm sorry.

1:02:19.610 --> 1:02:21.320
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

1:02:22.321 --> 1:02:23.531
Stop saying that.

1:02:25.283 --> 1:02:26.659
I'm going to get some air.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:22.215
Sit down.

1:03:39.398 --> 1:03:41.484
When you first traveled through time,

1:03:42.527 --> 1:03:43.945
how did it make you feel?

1:03:47.073 --> 1:03:49.242
Why do you suddenly ask?

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:51.994
I'm just curious.

1:03:55.498 --> 1:03:56.749
At first...

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:01.963
I was happy and felt
like I had the whole world.

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:06.342
I can imagine you did.

1:04:10.096 --> 1:04:11.931
It must be so hard now, though.

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:23.234
If only I hadn't sent
all the Happiness employees on a trip...

1:04:25.319 --> 1:04:27.738
There would have been people
on the construction site.

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:30.157
Don't say things like that.

1:04:32.702 --> 1:04:35.413
I can't help but wonder
if I made things turn out like this.

1:04:36.455 --> 1:04:38.040
I said don't think like that.

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:41.919
Let's just think

1:04:44.630 --> 1:04:46.799
there was nothing we could do.

1:04:52.930 --> 1:04:54.724
But I knew everything, though.

1:04:55.892 --> 1:04:57.518
How come I couldn't do anything?

1:05:00.354 --> 1:05:01.397
What about me, then?

1:05:03.399 --> 1:05:04.442
What about Ki-doong?

1:05:07.194 --> 1:05:09.113
We all knew everything,

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:11.449
but nothing could've been done about it.

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:18.205
Don't say nothing could've been done.

1:05:19.999 --> 1:05:21.918
How could nothing be done?

1:05:27.048 --> 1:05:29.008
I knew all about it...

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:32.887
I knew everything.

1:05:41.437 --> 1:05:44.357
I want to let you cry all you want,
but I can't do it.

1:05:47.526 --> 1:05:50.863
When you're like this,
my heart aches so much, So-joon.

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:02.625
So-joon.

1:06:04.627 --> 1:06:07.004
Let's just say
nothing could've been done about it.

1:06:15.638 --> 1:06:17.431
"Nothing could've been done…"

1:06:19.809 --> 1:06:20.810
Don't say that.

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:24.772
<i>If nothing can be done,</i>

1:06:26.399 --> 1:06:31.070
<i>that means</i>
<i>we don't have much time left either.</i>

1:07:11.527 --> 1:07:12.403
<i>Accidental death?</i>

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:14.780
Can you determine that so quickly?

1:07:14.864 --> 1:07:16.907
Who would do that to a person like him?

1:07:17.283 --> 1:07:18.659
<i>I might be able to do it too.</i>

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:20.703
<i>I'll follow you to the future.</i>

1:07:20.786 --> 1:07:22.913
<i>You went to the future</i>
<i>and didn't come back.</i>

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:24.874
<i>Weren't you reported missing?</i>

1:07:24.957 --> 1:07:28.044
<i>It could be worse than what you know.</i>

1:07:28.335 --> 1:07:30.880
<i>I didn't leave on my own.</i>

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:34.091
Why do you think you went missing?
Because you changed your future!

1:07:34.467 --> 1:07:38.179
I think marrying
you might have been my mistake.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:44.060
