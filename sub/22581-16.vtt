00:08.109 --> 00:11.070
The captain said they'd be
mapping this asteroid field,

00:11.270 --> 00:13.031
but I can't see
head nor tails of them.

00:13.351 --> 00:15.111
Maybe it's another asteroid field.

00:15.311 --> 00:16.791
No, this is the one.

00:17.031 --> 00:19.911
Two primaries, 17 planetesimals.

00:20.151 --> 00:23.191
Well, they weren't expecting
us back for three days.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.351
Maybe they finished
and went to do something else.

00:25.591 --> 00:28.031
Well, with our sensor array down,

00:28.231 --> 00:31.591
we won't know when they
get back until we see them.

00:32.551 --> 00:34.351
Any luck with the com?

00:34.591 --> 00:36.311
Dead as a doornail.

00:36.591 --> 00:37.912
I don't understand it.

00:38.112 --> 00:40.952
Well, no doubt you'll have your boys
take this pod apart piece by piece

00:41.152 --> 00:42.672
once it's back in the launch bay.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.552
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
having everything in working order

00:45.752 --> 00:47.992
by the time Enterprise gets back.

00:48.232 --> 00:51.832
Well, tinker all you like.
I've got a copy of Ulysses here.

00:52.032 --> 00:54.872
I doubt I'll even be halfway through it
by the time the ship gets back.

00:55.192 --> 00:57.752
I'd rather realign every
microcircuit on this shuttle

00:57.992 --> 01:00.072
than try to wade through that baby.

01:00.272 --> 01:02.513
British schools
have a core curriculum.

01:02.713 --> 01:05.833
It serves to provide
a well-rounded education.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.473
Sometimes I think
you North Americans

01:07.673 --> 01:11.673
read nothing but comic books and
those ridiculous science-fiction novels.

01:11.873 --> 01:16.353
I'll have you know that Superman
was laced with metaphor.

01:16.633 --> 01:18.633
Subtext layered on subtext.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.873
Oh, if only Dr Cochrane
had been a European.

01:22.073 --> 01:24.593
The Vulcans would've been
far less reticent to help us.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.834
But no, he had to be from Montana.

01:29.594 --> 01:32.034
He probably spent his nights reading
about cowboys and Indians.

01:32.314 --> 01:35.354
I don't recall any Europeans figuring
out how to build a warp engine.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.554
- Commander.
- No Brits,

01:37.754 --> 01:41.474
- no Italians, no Serbo-Croatians...
- Commander.

01:41.954 --> 01:44.634
I think you'd better come
and take a look at this.

01:52.315 --> 01:54.515
Bring us in closer.

02:01.195 --> 02:03.115
Is it a ship?

02:03.315 --> 02:06.234
If the damn sensors
were only working, we could...

02:07.554 --> 02:09.554
Bring us around again.

02:16.914 --> 02:18.675
There. Slow down.

"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

02:37.995 --> 02:41.355
"It's been a long time"

02:41.595 --> 02:45.436
"But my time is finally near"

02:45.676 --> 02:49.916
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:50.116 --> 02:53.036
"I will touch the sky"

02:53.236 --> 02:56.996
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:57.236 --> 03:00.276
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

03:00.476 --> 03:05.196
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

03:05.396 --> 03:08.317
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

03:08.517 --> 03:13.117
"I've got faith to believe"

03:13.317 --> 03:15.877
"I can do anything"

03:16.117 --> 03:20.557
"I've got strength of the soul"

03:20.837 --> 03:23.677
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

03:23.917 --> 03:29.197
"I can reach any star"

03:29.637 --> 03:33.358
"I've got faith"

03:33.598 --> 03:37.278
"I've got faith"

03:37.518 --> 03:42.278
"Faith of the heart"

04:00.634 --> 04:02.434
Come in.

04:04.154 --> 04:05.434
How are the Tesnians doing?

04:05.594 --> 04:09.433
Dr Phlox can only keep 12 of them
in the decon chamber at a time.

04:09.673 --> 04:12.433
What about the other, what is it, 22?

04:12.673 --> 04:15.713
He's rotating them. They seem
to be doing fine on our atmosphere,

04:15.953 --> 04:19.113
but they need at least six hours
of boron gas a day.

04:19.273 --> 04:21.632
He says we've got enough
to get them home.

04:21.833 --> 04:25.153
- Have you learned their language?
- Yes, sir.

04:25.673 --> 04:26.913
What do they have to say?

04:27.593 --> 04:29.033
They're pretty rattled.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.993
Most of them had been
on that ship for years.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.233
It's a lot to digest.
They lost everything.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.873
They're alive.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.672
Does the captain have
any idea what happened?

04:40.832 --> 04:44.792
No, and he feels terrible
about the damage to Enterprise.

04:45.032 --> 04:46.872
He has no idea what went wrong.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.913
When they approached
our docking port,

04:49.153 --> 04:52.393
they lost control of their sensor array.
And then a few seconds later,

04:52.553 --> 04:54.792
their navigation system went out.

04:55.072 --> 04:56.992
Thank God their escape pods
were working.

04:57.392 --> 05:00.552
I saw the wreckage on the asteroid.
There wasn't much left.

05:04.112 --> 05:07.072
Archer to Mayweather.
What's our ETA?

05:07.272 --> 05:09.671
We should reach Tesnia
in about 20 hours, sir.

05:09.871 --> 05:11.191
Good work.

05:11.431 --> 05:13.592
That should get us back
to our rendezvous coordinates

05:13.792 --> 05:15.592
well before
Trip and Malcolm get there.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.432
Let's drop out of warp
for a few minutes.

05:17.632 --> 05:19.752
I wanna inspect the damage
to the launch doors.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.352
Aye, sir.

05:29.071 --> 05:31.471
Who's in charge of engineering
while Trip's away?

05:31.671 --> 05:33.271
Lieutenant Hess.

05:33.431 --> 05:35.751
Tell her to get a team working
on a new starboard door

05:35.951 --> 05:37.792
for Launch Bay Two.

05:46.271 --> 05:48.791
Everything else check out all right?

05:49.831 --> 05:52.671
Astrometrics detected
what could be micro-singularities

05:52.871 --> 05:55.790
in the vicinity of the asteroid field.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.830
Micro-singularities
are a Vulcan myth.

05:58.990 --> 06:02.149
There's no scientific
evidence that they exist.

06:02.349 --> 06:05.310
Our deflectors registered
some unusual charged particles

06:05.550 --> 06:08.670
at the same time the Tesnian
ship began to malfunction.

06:08.870 --> 06:10.949
Any similar damage on Enterprise?

06:11.149 --> 06:12.669
No.

06:12.909 --> 06:15.829
But our hull plating was polarized.

06:16.029 --> 06:18.109
Micro-singularities.

06:18.309 --> 06:22.189
If the Vulcans had their way, they'd
blame them for the common cold.

06:26.188 --> 06:28.869
How about the lifeboats?
They could've launched the lifeboats

06:29.069 --> 06:30.829
- before the crash.
- They'd be here.

06:31.029 --> 06:33.029
They only go 300 kph.

06:33.229 --> 06:35.709
They'd be right here,
waiting for us to return.

06:36.349 --> 06:38.189
Are we sure there are no survivors?

06:38.469 --> 06:41.388
Commander, we have to figure out
what we're going to do.

06:43.388 --> 06:46.268
We can't just leave.
That's Enterprise.

06:46.668 --> 06:48.428
At least we should
find the black boxes.

06:48.628 --> 06:51.388
With what?
We have no radio.

06:51.548 --> 06:53.829
Nothing to pick up the beacons.

06:54.069 --> 06:55.628
What's the range
on our distress beacon?

06:55.868 --> 06:58.028
- It's off-line.
- I'm talking about the portable one.

06:58.268 --> 06:59.828
The one in the away kit.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.188
Ten million kilometres, maybe 20.
But I highly doubt

07:02.348 --> 07:04.748
there'd be a ship
anywhere close to that.

07:06.348 --> 07:09.308
We've only got ten days
worth of breathable air.

07:11.907 --> 07:14.827
- How far to Echo Three?
- At impulse?

07:14.987 --> 07:16.867
A lot more than ten days.

07:18.908 --> 07:22.388
If we could get close enough
for it to pick up our distress beacon,

07:22.828 --> 07:24.748
it'd relay the signal back to Starfleet.

07:25.468 --> 07:27.747
I'm afraid the math
doesn't work out, commander.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.587
It's going to take weeks,
maybe months

07:29.747 --> 07:31.547
for our signal to reach Echo Three.

07:31.747 --> 07:34.667
By the time Starfleet
got a ship out here, we'd be...

07:35.947 --> 07:39.387
- We'd be long dead.
- But at least they'd find us.

07:40.187 --> 07:42.386
They'd get their shuttlepod back,

07:42.586 --> 07:44.467
a couple of...

07:45.987 --> 07:48.267
- Well-preserved corpses.
- Sir.

07:48.587 --> 07:51.147
- Which way?
- Which way to what?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.227
Echo Three.
Which way to Echo Three?

07:53.467 --> 07:56.027
- I told you, it's too far.
- Do you know which direction it is,

07:56.226 --> 07:58.706
- or don't you?
- Navigation is down.

07:58.946 --> 08:02.146
- That's not what I asked you!
- You want me to guess?

08:02.546 --> 08:05.146
You come from a long line of navy
men, and you got a good memory.

08:05.386 --> 08:07.827
Look hard at those stars, find
something that looks familiar,

08:08.027 --> 08:10.067
- and tell me which way to go.
- Sir.

08:10.347 --> 08:12.146
That's an order!

08:13.586 --> 08:15.626
I don't suppose
you have a sextant handy.

08:21.506 --> 08:23.746
I left it with my slide rule.

08:34.946 --> 08:36.346
Well?

08:36.905 --> 08:40.586
That blue giant, we may have
gone by it. I'm not sure.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.025
That's good enough for me.

08:44.665 --> 08:47.705
Take one more low pass
over the wreckage.

08:50.065 --> 08:52.225
And then set a course.

09:04.265 --> 09:06.385
See you around, captain.

09:17.944 --> 09:20.744
Personal log,
Lieutenant Malcolm Reed.

09:20.944 --> 09:23.545
November 9th, 2151.

09:23.945 --> 09:25.665
By the time anyone hears this,

09:25.825 --> 09:28.704
by anyone, I suppose
I mean anyone human,

09:28.904 --> 09:31.864
Commander Tucker and I
will be long dead.

09:32.504 --> 09:33.984
It's my intention
to recount the events

09:34.224 --> 09:37.304
that led to the destruction
of the starship Enterprise,

09:37.704 --> 09:39.864
and to express my deepest feelings

09:40.064 --> 09:43.303
regarding my short,
but memorable service with Starfleet.

09:43.463 --> 09:48.144
Tell them I'd love to add my two cents,
but I'm trying to get a little work done.

09:52.344 --> 09:55.544
- Short, but memorable service
with Starfleet.

09:55.784 --> 09:59.262
In order to test the targeting
scanners on Shuttlepod One,

09:59.462 --> 10:01.942
Commander Tucker and I
had to get at least 20,000 kilometres

10:02.102 --> 10:03.862
from Enterprise.

10:04.022 --> 10:09.262
During our third trial, we experienced
a brief, but sizable jolt.

10:09.502 --> 10:12.502
And shortly thereafter, realized
that our sensor array had gone off-line.

10:12.703 --> 10:15.662
This sensor array is more than off-line.
It's totally fried.

10:20.622 --> 10:22.902
- That our sensor array
had gone of-line.

10:23.142 --> 10:25.862
We had no choice
but to head back to the asteroid field,

10:26.102 --> 10:29.341
where Enterprise was involved
in a mapping project.

10:30.221 --> 10:33.821
We found the ship destroyed.

10:34.381 --> 10:36.501
It's debris strewn across
a square kilometre

10:36.701 --> 10:38.982
of one of the larger asteroids.

10:39.142 --> 10:40.422
Had our sensors been working,

10:40.622 --> 10:42.422
we certainly would've done
everything possible

10:42.622 --> 10:45.501
to determine the cause
of the disaster.

10:45.941 --> 10:50.501
But as it was, with only a short-range
distress beacon and limited air,

10:50.861 --> 10:54.181
we had no alternative
but to set a course for Echo Three,

10:54.461 --> 10:56.621
where someday this vessel...

10:56.821 --> 10:59.620
...eventually this log, will be found.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.941
May God have mercy on our souls.

11:03.141 --> 11:06.421
Why don't you cut the crap
and get back here and help me?

11:09.941 --> 11:12.421
- What would you like me to do?
- I don't know.

11:12.661 --> 11:16.340
You could hold this flashlight, or turn
down the heat, whatever you want.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.540
I'm just getting a little tired
of listening to all your pessimism.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.260
If there's something
you need me to do,

11:21.500 --> 11:23.260
I will be more than happy to comply.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.820
But I'm afraid pessimism

11:25.020 --> 11:28.061
is simply not an accurate description
of my log entry.

11:28.741 --> 11:30.380
I'm just being realistic, commander.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.860
We've got nine days.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.820
We're bound
to find someone out here.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.220
At warp, perhaps.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.780
- But at impulse?
- Vulcans, Klingons,

11:40.020 --> 11:42.820
Suliban, Xyrillians, Andorians.

11:43.060 --> 11:45.739
God knows who's gonna be lurking
around the next planet we run into.

11:46.019 --> 11:47.459
But that's just it, sir.

11:47.619 --> 11:51.139
At impulse, we're not likely
to be running into any planets.

11:51.339 --> 11:53.500
Not for at least six or seven years.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.260
Then somebody could run into us.
You ever think of that?

11:56.460 --> 11:59.619
Or see us on their sensors.
The possibilities are endless.

12:01.979 --> 12:04.339
I'll heat up some rations.

12:05.259 --> 12:08.459
Unless you'd rather wait until we run
into a vessel serving proper meals?

12:11.579 --> 12:13.899
Rations will be fine.

12:17.178 --> 12:19.179
What are you in the mood for?

12:20.459 --> 12:22.699
Depends.
What are you serving?

12:23.739 --> 12:25.859
Veal Marsala...

12:26.419 --> 12:28.379
...Chilean sea bass...

12:28.539 --> 12:30.218
...Moo Goo Gai Pan.

12:30.418 --> 12:32.218
Any meatloaf?

12:35.858 --> 12:38.578
- With gravy and mashed potatoes.
- Perfect.

12:45.858 --> 12:47.178
Kentucky bourbon.

12:47.418 --> 12:50.578
Yeah, the captain was planning
to give that to somebody.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.538
Can't remember who.

12:55.498 --> 12:57.018
Guess it's ours now.

13:31.336 --> 13:34.337
- What's that?
- The sea bass.

13:36.897 --> 13:38.177
Any good?

13:41.097 --> 13:44.417
It's lovely. Thank you.

13:51.296 --> 13:53.815
Captain Archer claims you told him
you weren't even aware

13:54.055 --> 13:56.415
that I was serving on Enterprise.

13:56.575 --> 13:58.736
I find that difficult to believe,

13:58.976 --> 14:02.975
considering I wrote you twice
in the weeks prior to our departure.

14:03.215 --> 14:06.895
Now, it is possible that you
never received those letters.

14:07.135 --> 14:11.295
You were, I believe, in the process
of moving back to Malaysia at the time.

14:11.495 --> 14:14.375
But you must have spoken
to Aunt Sherry during that period.

14:14.615 --> 14:17.414
And I know she received my letters.

14:17.894 --> 14:20.014
I would hate to go to my death

14:20.214 --> 14:22.174
thinking that either of you
felt I was trying to...

14:22.414 --> 14:23.855
Malcolm!

14:24.375 --> 14:26.655
You've been at it for hours now.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.815
Don't you think it's time
to give it a rest?

14:29.015 --> 14:30.375
As I'm sure you must have heard,

14:30.575 --> 14:33.934
that was my esteemed colleague,
Commander Charles Tucker.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.174
Mr Tucker doesn't share my belief

14:36.414 --> 14:39.094
that it is essential
to say what must be said.

14:39.334 --> 14:42.254
To leave a record,
tie up loose ends.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.774
Mr Tucker is labouring
under the false hope

14:45.014 --> 14:49.214
that we are going to be miraculously
rescued before we both suffocate.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.494
Mr and Mrs Reed...

14:53.454 --> 14:55.414
I realize you've just begun
a period of mourning,

14:55.614 --> 14:58.054
and that I'll never get
an answer to this question,

14:58.254 --> 15:00.574
but I gotta ask it anyway.

15:01.094 --> 15:03.773
Was Malcolm always this cynical?

15:06.253 --> 15:10.013
In a few days, when the reality of this
situation actually begins to sink in,

15:10.613 --> 15:13.814
you might very well decide you want
to record some logs of your own.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.693
You have my word,
I will not interrupt you.

15:17.893 --> 15:20.453
I just need to get
some sleep, Malcolm.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.093
Is that so hard to understand?

15:22.333 --> 15:25.733
We have less than nine days
of oxygen left.

15:25.933 --> 15:29.013
It seems a waste
to use it up sleeping.

15:29.373 --> 15:33.292
If I don't waste some oxygen sleeping,
I'm gonna start getting real cranky.

15:33.492 --> 15:35.292
And you don't wanna spend
your last nine days

15:35.492 --> 15:37.973
cooped up with me when I'm cranky.

15:39.173 --> 15:43.453
So turn that thing off
and get some rest.

16:02.531 --> 16:03.772
We're back.

16:03.972 --> 16:05.412
Lie still, lieutenant.

16:06.572 --> 16:08.332
What happened?

16:09.252 --> 16:12.292
- How did we...?
- You're a very brave man, Malcolm.

16:12.492 --> 16:15.412
Commander Tucker is gonna
be fine, thanks to you.

16:16.812 --> 16:19.771
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Get some rest.

16:20.011 --> 16:23.891
There will be plenty of time to explain
what happened in the morning.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.732
Sub-commander?

16:32.332 --> 16:34.171
How are you feeling?

16:34.371 --> 16:37.131
I'd feel a lot better
if I knew what was going on.

16:40.571 --> 16:42.811
Captain Archer would be
quite annoyed with me

16:43.011 --> 16:45.331
if I told you of your heroics.

16:45.531 --> 16:49.410
I believe he's looking forward
to doing that himself in the morning.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.370
- Heroics?
- I had no idea

16:52.570 --> 16:54.571
you could be so selfless.

16:54.771 --> 16:58.011
In the face of such danger,
most males of your species

16:58.211 --> 17:00.931
would've given in to their fear.

17:02.691 --> 17:04.329
Well...

17:04.530 --> 17:08.050
...since you're obviously not
going to tell me what happened...

17:08.250 --> 17:12.410
...I suppose a simple
good night will have to do.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.530
Vulcans can never ignore courage.

17:18.849 --> 17:20.890
And this Vulcan...

17:21.290 --> 17:24.329
...will never ignore Lieutenant
Malcolm Reed again.

17:24.810 --> 17:30.690
I can't say I've ever
ignored you, T'Pol.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.729
Is it all right if I call you T'Pol?

17:33.929 --> 17:35.529
Yes.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.689
May I call you Malcolm?

17:38.209 --> 17:40.289
I suppose so.

17:40.889 --> 17:46.050
But if the truth be known, I've never
much cared for the name Malcolm.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.368
Always seemed a bit too stuffy.

17:50.008 --> 17:52.608
I think it's a lovely name.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.728
Mol-Kom is the Vulcan
word for serenity.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.848
Well then...

17:59.288 --> 18:01.808
...perhaps I won't change it.

18:02.768 --> 18:04.447
Pity though...

18:04.967 --> 18:07.327
...I was rather growing fond
of the name:

18:08.448 --> 18:09.928
"Stinky."

18:11.248 --> 18:13.048
I can't believe you just did that.

18:13.848 --> 18:17.128
- Did what?
- You smiled.

18:17.408 --> 18:18.928
I saw you smile.

18:19.647 --> 18:21.247
Vulcans don't smile.

18:21.447 --> 18:23.687
This one does.

18:23.887 --> 18:25.447
I saw you.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.247
You're mistaken.

18:27.487 --> 18:30.967
It was when I said Stinky, wasn't it?

18:31.167 --> 18:34.927
You smiled when I said Stinky.

18:35.127 --> 18:37.767
Good morning, Stinky.

18:37.967 --> 18:41.207
It's a lovely day, isn't it, Stinky?

18:47.287 --> 18:49.366
- What's that?
- I got the receiver working,

18:49.606 --> 18:52.206
but the transmitter's a lost cause.
Who's Stinky?

18:55.126 --> 18:56.446
I beg your pardon?

18:56.646 --> 18:58.967
You were talking in your sleep.

18:59.807 --> 19:02.807
Kept calling for some guy
named Stinky.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.966
You repaired the receiver.

19:06.206 --> 19:07.926
What is that?
Is it a ship?

19:08.206 --> 19:10.446
The range is very limited.

19:10.646 --> 19:12.966
It's probably just white noise.

19:13.206 --> 19:16.166
The sound of the galaxy
laughing at us.

19:17.486 --> 19:19.725
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know,

19:20.005 --> 19:22.565
but it felt a little like whatever
knocked out the sensor array.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.406
We're losing atmosphere.
Pressure's down 8 percent.

19:25.566 --> 19:27.806
- Help me, we gotta find the hole.
- Without sensors,

19:28.046 --> 19:29.766
it's not gonna be easy
to locate the breach.

19:30.006 --> 19:31.886
Then use your ears.

19:35.365 --> 19:39.045
- Pressure's down 22 percent.
- The damn hole's too small.

19:39.605 --> 19:40.845
Where is it?

19:46.405 --> 19:48.766
- What are you doing?
- It's nitrogen for the coolant tanks.

19:48.966 --> 19:51.205
Just give me a few seconds.

19:56.285 --> 19:58.405
Now let's find that leak.

20:01.605 --> 20:03.205
I got it.
It's over here.

20:03.445 --> 20:05.364
There's another one down here.

20:05.564 --> 20:08.684
Put your finger on it
until we can figure out what to do.

20:09.764 --> 20:11.724
We've got some valve sealant
in storage bin three.

20:12.164 --> 20:14.365
Have we got anything a little closer?

20:16.325 --> 20:19.445
- Do you mind passing your meatloaf?
- What?

20:19.685 --> 20:21.124
I assume you're finished with it.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.003
And you came close to criticizing
my choice of cuisine.

20:56.963 --> 21:00.363
Obviously, whatever hit us
went clear through the pod.

21:01.763 --> 21:05.284
I'm afraid it did more than just
puncture the cabin, commander.

21:05.564 --> 21:09.643
On its way out, it was kind enough
to rupture one of the O2 cylinders.

21:10.483 --> 21:12.203
Great.

21:12.443 --> 21:14.323
How much closer to oblivion are we?

21:20.323 --> 21:22.482
We've got less than
two days of air left.

21:33.243 --> 21:35.283
The skin of this pod is designed
to deflect a meteor

21:35.443 --> 21:37.402
five times the size of this hole.

21:37.642 --> 21:40.882
Well, in that case,
I'd guess it wasn't a meteor.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.601
I wonder if something
like it destroyed Enterprise.

21:45.481 --> 21:47.401
We'll never know.

21:48.521 --> 21:51.081
Always the optimist.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.401
We have 40 hours of air left.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.841
What do you expect me to do,
sit here and plan my wedding?

21:58.001 --> 22:01.801
I'm confident there'll be
a Charles Tucker IV one day.

22:01.961 --> 22:04.361
Then maybe it's your wedding
we should be planning.

22:04.561 --> 22:08.000
That's assuming we can find you
a bride in the next day and a half.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.600
Any suggestions?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.320
There was a little bar in Mill Valley

22:11.520 --> 22:13.240
where all the Starfleet
trainees used to go.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.280
- The 602 Club.
- You know it?

22:16.440 --> 22:18.161
I was there more times
than I can remember.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.841
I met the girl of my dreams
my first Friday night there.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.080
She was the one,
there's no doubt about it.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.240
We had it all figured out.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.120
Where we'd live,
how many kids we'd have.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.880
Ah, Ruby.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.519
- Whatever happened to you?
- Ruby?

22:39.919 --> 22:42.919
- You don't mean the waitress Ruby?
- You knew Ruby?

22:45.080 --> 22:47.400
I knew her more times
than I can remember.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.600
Ouch.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.240
Seems we have more in common
than we thought.

22:52.959 --> 22:54.559
Yeah.

22:56.079 --> 22:58.239
Would another half-day
be worth freezing your butt off?

22:58.559 --> 23:01.239
- What are you talking about?
- If we lower the thermostat in here

23:01.399 --> 23:03.359
to about minus five centigrade...

23:03.559 --> 23:06.159
...we should be able to use that power
to enhance the efficiency

23:06.319 --> 23:08.919
of the atmosphere recyclers.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.799
Our last two and a half
days freezing,

23:11.999 --> 23:15.599
versus our last two days
toasty warm.

23:16.399 --> 23:18.159
What a delightful choice.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.999
I'd pick freezing.
Another half-day is another half-day.

23:22.838 --> 23:24.838
Freezing it is, then.

23:29.358 --> 23:31.718
- And just what are you doing?
- An officer at his best

23:31.918 --> 23:33.839
is always well-groomed.

23:34.799 --> 23:37.319
Nice to see you're developing
a more positive attitude.

23:38.238 --> 23:39.638
Actually...

23:39.878 --> 23:42.158
...I was thinking about
what our corpses would look like

23:42.398 --> 23:43.878
when they're eventually found.

23:44.118 --> 23:47.758
With no air in the pod, we should
remain in fairly good condition.

23:48.438 --> 23:49.958
Charming.

23:50.158 --> 23:52.878
- But you're forgetting one thing.
- What's that?

23:53.078 --> 23:55.797
If I remember my honours
biology course correctly,

23:55.997 --> 24:00.078
your hair and nails keep growing
for quite a while after you're dead.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.158
I'm pretty sure
that includes your beard.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.317
Thanks.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.717
Come in.

24:22.397 --> 24:26.237
I've analyzed the scans we took of the
Tesnian ship right before it crashed.

24:26.397 --> 24:28.957
I believe they were hit
by a micro-singularity.

24:29.237 --> 24:32.717
- You still chasing gremlins?
- This is no myth, captain.

24:32.957 --> 24:34.797
Three of the singularities
also hit Enterprise.

24:35.037 --> 24:38.756
They collided with our hull plating
here, here and here.

24:38.996 --> 24:41.476
You're telling me
these are tiny black holes?

24:41.676 --> 24:42.956
They were.

24:43.116 --> 24:46.796
The dispersal patterns suggest
they dissipated on impact.

24:50.077 --> 24:53.397
This could be
a significant discovery, captain.

24:53.757 --> 24:57.156
If we could get quantum sensor
readings of the three impact points,

24:57.356 --> 24:59.436
we could authenticate our findings.

25:00.396 --> 25:03.436
I'd be a little less concerned with
winning the Nobel Prize right now,

25:03.596 --> 25:05.636
and a little more concerned
with Trip and Malcolm.

25:06.356 --> 25:08.956
Their shuttlepod doesn't have
the hull plating we do.

25:09.195 --> 25:13.356
They could be in for a rough ride when
they get back to the asteroid field.

25:14.556 --> 25:18.236
Better hail them.
Agree to a new rendezvous point.

25:18.756 --> 25:21.076
I never intended to suggest
that our crewmembers

25:21.276 --> 25:23.996
were less important
than a scientific discovery.

25:25.035 --> 25:27.875
Even one of this historic magnitude.

25:28.835 --> 25:30.035
Time's a-wasting.

25:36.915 --> 25:39.035
My dearest Deborah:

25:39.275 --> 25:41.474
By this time, I'm certain
you've learned of the tragedy

25:41.634 --> 25:44.034
that befell the starship Enterprise.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.714
You've also learned that my colleague,
Commander Charles Tucker and I

25:47.954 --> 25:51.074
did manage to survive
for a few days after the accident.

25:51.314 --> 25:55.313
It's during that brief time that
I've chosen to correspond with you.

25:55.513 --> 25:59.313
Although our relationship
was short-lived,

25:59.513 --> 26:02.113
and at times tumultuous...

26:02.313 --> 26:05.234
...I can't help but picture
your beautiful smile.

26:05.434 --> 26:07.874
It gives me great comfort.

26:08.554 --> 26:10.473
Think of me from time to time.

26:10.673 --> 26:12.833
Cordially, Malcolm.

26:14.953 --> 26:16.513
A ship?

26:16.713 --> 26:19.433
It's a little more modulated
than the last one.

26:19.673 --> 26:22.833
But it could be just
a random gamma-ray burst.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.593
My dearest Rochelle:

26:30.833 --> 26:32.633
By this time, I'm certain
you've learned of...

26:32.873 --> 26:34.513
Wouldn't it be easier
to record one message

26:34.753 --> 26:36.993
and then add the
"Dear Whoever" afterward?

26:37.233 --> 26:39.073
This is your fifth or sixth
identical letter.

26:39.313 --> 26:42.072
That's not true.
There have been subtle differences.

26:42.312 --> 26:46.032
I would never refer to Rochelle
as having a beautiful smile.

26:47.032 --> 26:49.192
With her, it was the eyes.

26:51.512 --> 26:56.552
Travis and Hoshi couldn't have
been more than 24, 25 years old.

26:57.232 --> 26:59.992
If the captain were here with us now...

27:00.192 --> 27:03.192
...I wonder if he'd feel guilty
about bringing them on this mission.

27:04.072 --> 27:06.952
Not for a minute.
They died doing what they love.

27:08.352 --> 27:11.191
I don't remember Hoshi loving much
about being in deep space.

27:11.391 --> 27:13.271
Oh, she was coming along.

27:13.471 --> 27:16.511
She saved our asses
on more than one occasion.

27:17.151 --> 27:20.712
I plan on letting her family
know just how essential she was.

27:20.992 --> 27:23.352
Sounds to me like you do have
some letters to record.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.831
I'll wait to tell them in person.

27:28.191 --> 27:30.711
You know, your treacly optimism

27:30.911 --> 27:33.151
is beginning to get
just a little bit tiresome.

27:33.351 --> 27:36.791
Unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell
to half the girls in San Francisco?

27:37.791 --> 27:40.151
At least I'm capable
of accepting our fate.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.910
We're going to be dead
in about 33 hours.

27:43.150 --> 27:45.791
Whether our beards continue
to grow or not is of no concern to me.

27:45.991 --> 27:49.471
We will be dead. And unless some
ship happens to cross our path,

27:49.711 --> 27:52.631
our bearded bodies will be discovered
in about three or four years.

27:52.831 --> 27:54.591
Is that optimistic enough for you?

27:54.791 --> 27:57.350
What's your problem
with having a little hope?

27:57.630 --> 27:59.750
What's your problem
with facing the truth?

28:00.110 --> 28:02.870
You're a regular Grim Reaper,
Malcolm. Anyone ever tell you that?

28:05.390 --> 28:08.751
Well, if this little trip
is a death sentence,

28:08.951 --> 28:12.910
then it would seem to me
we're entitled to a last meal.

28:13.990 --> 28:17.910
What'll it be? I'm afraid our selection
is somewhat limited.

28:18.150 --> 28:20.110
I'm not hungry.

28:22.070 --> 28:24.630
Well then, how about a drink?

28:25.430 --> 28:27.589
I don't drink on duty.

28:28.069 --> 28:29.909
Are you serious?

28:30.109 --> 28:32.389
We're dead men, remember?

28:33.470 --> 28:35.270
What's the matter, lieutenant?

28:35.430 --> 28:37.870
Are you afraid the autopsy will show

28:38.110 --> 28:42.029
your blood alcohol level
was too high to pilot a shuttle?

28:54.709 --> 28:56.509
Live a little.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.469
That's an order.

29:34.427 --> 29:36.787
Do you really think
that's gonna provide any heat?

29:37.027 --> 29:39.347
The bourbon'll provide the heat.

29:39.547 --> 29:41.867
The candle's just for mood.

29:49.867 --> 29:52.307
To the brave men and women...

29:53.947 --> 29:56.427
...of the starship Enterprise.

30:07.786 --> 30:10.226
You know that's gonna
consume oxygen, don't you?

30:11.066 --> 30:15.266
We'll probably be dead five or six
minutes earlier than we would've been.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.026
I can live with that.

30:19.266 --> 30:22.306
Anyway, seems to me as far as you're
concerned, the sooner the better.

30:22.546 --> 30:25.066
Is that really how you see me?

30:25.466 --> 30:27.706
The eternal pessimist?

30:27.866 --> 30:30.105
The Grim Reaper?

30:30.905 --> 30:33.745
I don't want to die.
What makes you think I want to die?

30:34.025 --> 30:37.185
Because ever since we saw Enterprise
spread across that asteroid,

30:37.425 --> 30:39.546
you've done nothing
but write your own obituary.

30:40.226 --> 30:44.705
I lost nearly everyone
I cared about on that ship.

30:45.305 --> 30:47.225
Those girls I talked about.

30:47.385 --> 30:50.385
Rochelle, Deborah, Catelin.

30:50.625 --> 30:56.465
None of them worked out because
I could never get very close to them.

30:58.904 --> 31:02.184
Never got very close to my
family either, for that matter.

31:03.224 --> 31:05.785
Not that it's any business of yours.

31:10.545 --> 31:13.744
But with the crew of the Enterprise,
it was different.

31:15.304 --> 31:17.504
I was really starting to feel...

31:18.504 --> 31:20.504
...comfortable with them.

31:24.304 --> 31:28.144
Now the only one that's left
thinks I'm the bloody Angel of Death.

31:41.224 --> 31:45.263
All of a sudden, five or six more
minutes sounds kind of nice.

31:55.304 --> 31:58.544
Does that sound
modulated enough for you?

31:58.744 --> 31:59.983
Modulated?

32:00.223 --> 32:02.343
The radio.

32:02.503 --> 32:06.703
Or is it just the galaxy
giggling at us again?

32:06.943 --> 32:09.023
It can giggle all it wants,

32:09.263 --> 32:12.423
but the galaxy's not getting
any of our bourbon.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.662
Hey...

32:16.902 --> 32:19.583
...what do you think of T'Pol?

32:19.823 --> 32:22.223
- Do you think she's pretty?
- T'Pol?

32:22.423 --> 32:24.183
Are you serious?

32:24.383 --> 32:26.423
Well, she is a woman, you know.

32:27.183 --> 32:28.583
I think she's pretty.

32:28.823 --> 32:31.302
You've had too much to drink.

32:32.422 --> 32:37.142
Don't tell me you've never looked
at her, you know, in that way.

32:37.462 --> 32:39.422
No, she's a Vulcan.

32:39.622 --> 32:42.542
Well, I think she's pretty.

32:42.742 --> 32:44.383
Oh, God.

32:44.902 --> 32:47.582
- You ever noticed her bum?
- What?

32:48.582 --> 32:50.382
Her bum.

32:52.982 --> 32:55.622
She's got an awfully nice bum.

33:02.221 --> 33:03.981
To Sub-commander T'Pol.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.622
Awfully nice.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.581
- It's probably nothing, right?
- It's definitely not nothing.

33:20.261 --> 33:21.981
Well, then that means
it's something.

33:22.181 --> 33:23.501
What is it?

33:23.661 --> 33:26.381
Well, is it something or someone,
because if it's someone...

33:26.581 --> 33:27.820
Sorry.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.940
Definitely someone.

33:30.380 --> 33:33.099
We have no way to respond, do we?

33:34.660 --> 33:38.180
This is like the plane flying over the
desert island in a lost-at-sea movie.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.340
- Malcolm!
- Sorry.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.060
Happy endings.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.180
I must think happy endings.

33:44.380 --> 33:46.979
Shuttlepod One, this is Enterprise.

33:47.179 --> 33:48.779
- Please respond.
- That's Hoshi.

33:48.979 --> 33:51.539
- Transmitting new coordinates.
- That's impossible.

33:51.859 --> 33:54.859
Don't be so pessimistic.
It's not impossible.

33:55.059 --> 33:56.859
It's Hoshi.

33:57.059 --> 33:58.860
They're okay.

33:59.060 --> 34:00.899
Enterprise is okay.

34:01.099 --> 34:02.899
It's Hoshi.

34:03.099 --> 34:05.339
Adjust your heading
to the new coordinates.

34:05.539 --> 34:07.779
We will rendezvous in two days.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.579
Commander and lieutenant,
please respond.

34:10.779 --> 34:12.498
"Rendezvous."

34:12.699 --> 34:15.619
What a beautiful word.

34:17.257 --> 34:19.098
What's wrong?

34:19.858 --> 34:22.297
They're still two days away.

34:24.099 --> 34:27.539
And we only have a little more
than one day's air left.

34:28.139 --> 34:31.257
And no way to tell them
to get here sooner.

34:42.658 --> 34:44.297
Are you sure you got
the coordinates right?

34:44.538 --> 34:46.058
Yes.

34:46.617 --> 34:49.217
- Not that it matters.
- Lieutenant.

34:49.658 --> 34:53.498
They're probably travelling at what,
warp 2, warp 3?

34:53.697 --> 34:55.898
Compared to them,
we're like a garden snail.

34:56.098 --> 34:59.698
Where we go and how fast
we get there is irrelevant.

35:00.338 --> 35:03.857
If I purge the CO2 filters,
it'll give us a little more air.

35:04.097 --> 35:07.017
How much, an hour's worth?

35:08.937 --> 35:11.337
- Probably less.
- Great.

35:11.537 --> 35:13.498
So when they reach us in two days,

35:13.698 --> 35:17.617
we'll have been out of air
for... 11 hours.

35:17.857 --> 35:20.617
You ever try holding your breath
for 11 hours?

35:21.737 --> 35:24.617
A train leaves New York
at 3 a.m. Heading west,

35:24.817 --> 35:28.457
while another leaves Chicago
at 4:30 heading east.

35:29.697 --> 35:31.697
I never could figure those out.

35:32.016 --> 35:36.536
Enterprise is going to wonder
why we haven't responded, right?

35:36.936 --> 35:38.977
Maybe they'll be concerned
and increase their speed.

35:39.177 --> 35:42.297
Maybe, but if we really wanna
get them to go to high warp,

35:42.497 --> 35:44.897
we're gonna have to
attract their attention.

35:45.097 --> 35:49.496
Something a little more dramatic
than not answering their hails.

35:49.696 --> 35:51.576
Can they see us on their sensors?

35:51.776 --> 35:53.736
Two days away at warp 3?

35:54.056 --> 35:58.016
Oh, they can see us,
maybe not too clearly...

35:58.216 --> 36:01.176
...but we should be a nice little blip
on T'Pol's viewer.

36:01.376 --> 36:05.376
Then we've got to get that blip
to tell them to pick up a little steam.

36:05.576 --> 36:07.256
What if we fired our weapons?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.976
They're nearly a quarter
of a light-year away.

36:10.176 --> 36:13.936
Our plasma cannons have a range
of less than ten kilometres.

36:14.696 --> 36:17.535
It would all still look like a single blip.

36:17.895 --> 36:20.255
It's gonna take a lot more than that.

36:21.815 --> 36:24.455
What if we jettison
the impulse drive?

36:24.655 --> 36:26.135
What good would that do?

36:26.375 --> 36:28.776
Well, you could rig a self-destruct.

36:28.976 --> 36:31.296
I imagine that would make
quite an explosion.

36:31.496 --> 36:34.335
Maybe even big enough to make
that blip do something odd.

36:34.935 --> 36:37.135
No, I can't blow up our engine.

36:37.335 --> 36:40.415
- We'd be adrift, dead in space.
- What's the difference between that

36:40.615 --> 36:43.335
and travelling at a snail's pace?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.455
I'm an engineer.
I won't blow up our only engine.

36:46.655 --> 36:48.614
Then I'll ask you again.

36:48.854 --> 36:51.134
Ever hold your breath for 11 hours?

36:55.175 --> 36:58.375
I think I have some micro-detonators
in here somewhere.

37:19.734 --> 37:23.133
How does it feel
to be slower than a snail?

37:25.293 --> 37:27.813
I saw a great cartoon once.

37:28.213 --> 37:32.773
There were these two snails
sitting on the back of a big old turtle.

37:32.973 --> 37:35.572
One snail turns to the other
and says,

37:36.932 --> 37:38.732
"Hold on, Fred.

37:39.212 --> 37:41.172
Here we go."

37:52.012 --> 37:55.212
If I'm right,
I get the rest of the bourbon.

37:55.452 --> 37:59.972
Fine. Less than 12 hours, you win.

38:00.252 --> 38:01.932
More than 12...

38:02.452 --> 38:04.291
...and it's mine.

38:04.691 --> 38:06.731
Go check the pressure gauge.

38:07.171 --> 38:11.252
You check it.
I don't think I can move my legs.

38:27.131 --> 38:29.091
I can't believe
we've been sitting here that long.

38:29.251 --> 38:31.211
Come on, let's hear it.

38:31.491 --> 38:33.211
How much air's left?

38:33.572 --> 38:35.011
Ten hours.

38:35.851 --> 38:38.611
That's probably
the last bet I'll ever make.

38:38.811 --> 38:40.771
And I won.

38:41.811 --> 38:44.811
I should feel like celebrating,
shouldn't I?

38:45.171 --> 38:46.731
The whiskey's yours.

38:46.891 --> 38:51.210
Now, why don't you give us a toast
before you drink it?

38:57.170 --> 39:00.491
Ten hours for two men.

39:10.250 --> 39:14.970
If there were only one of us,
he'd have 20 hours, wouldn't he?

39:16.170 --> 39:18.130
Great idea.

39:18.850 --> 39:24.170
Why don't you climb up
into the airlock and seal yourself in?

39:25.010 --> 39:26.490
That's just what I was thinking.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.050
Any last words
you want me to pass along?

39:31.290 --> 39:32.970
Yeah.

39:36.929 --> 39:39.369
Tell Captain Archer...

39:40.129 --> 39:42.969
...that it was one hell of an honour
serving with him.

39:43.169 --> 39:44.929
What are you doing?

39:45.169 --> 39:49.290
We don't know whether or not they
saw our little display of pyrotechnics.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.889
But either way,
this'll double your chances.

39:53.089 --> 39:56.129
- You're crazy. Get down from there!
- Sit down, lieutenant.

39:56.369 --> 39:58.369
If anyone should go up in there,
it should be me.

39:58.609 --> 40:01.009
- You're the chief engineer.
- I'm also in charge of deciding

40:01.209 --> 40:04.329
who's going into this airlock.
Do I make myself clear?

40:06.248 --> 40:07.608
Commander.

40:09.328 --> 40:11.328
What are you gonna do, kill me?

40:11.528 --> 40:15.049
It's set to stun.
I don't want to use it, but I will.

40:15.409 --> 40:18.609
- Put it down.
- Go to hell!

40:20.449 --> 40:22.248
Stop trying to be a hero.
It doesn't suit you.

40:22.448 --> 40:24.368
What would you know
about being a hero?

40:24.528 --> 40:27.368
It takes nothing but a coward
to crawl up inside a hole to die.

40:27.608 --> 40:29.248
Then go ahead and shoot me.

40:29.408 --> 40:31.848
But you better hope we don't make it,
because if we survive,

40:32.048 --> 40:35.768
the first thing I'm gonna do is bust your
ass back to Crewman Second Class.

40:36.007 --> 40:39.168
Be my guest.
I could use a little less responsibility.

40:39.368 --> 40:42.848
- Now, get down here.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

40:43.048 --> 40:45.128
Your armoury officer,
and perhaps your friend.

40:45.408 --> 40:46.848
Friends don't shoot each other.

40:47.048 --> 40:48.528
You know, I'm not a doctor,

40:48.728 --> 40:53.567
but I'm pretty sure you use up a lot
more oxygen when you shout like that!

41:02.567 --> 41:04.488
So, what are you saying?

41:05.488 --> 41:11.087
That you'd rather have Enterprise
find the two of us dead in here?

41:12.007 --> 41:14.967
That's exactly what I'm saying.

41:15.167 --> 41:17.806
If there's one chance
in a thousand...

41:18.006 --> 41:20.406
...that they saw
our impulse drive explode,

41:20.646 --> 41:23.045
that they increased their speed...

41:23.565 --> 41:25.845
...l'll take that chance.

41:26.125 --> 41:31.166
I've invested far too much time
trying to figure you out, Mr Tucker.

41:32.126 --> 41:36.725
I'm not about to accept
that it was all for nothing.

41:50.605 --> 41:51.924
We're back.

41:52.164 --> 41:54.445
- How...?
- Easy, Malcolm.

41:54.725 --> 41:57.445
You fellas had a nice little
bout with hypothermia.

41:58.205 --> 42:00.885
- The commander?
- He's gonna be fine.

42:01.085 --> 42:04.685
It took nearly three hours to get your
body temperatures back to normal.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.924
You must have seen the explosion.

42:08.084 --> 42:09.484
Hard to miss.

42:09.964 --> 42:12.924
You know, you guys only had
two or three hours of air left.

42:14.004 --> 42:16.044
You don't say.

42:17.604 --> 42:21.165
We saw debris from Enterprise
on one of the asteroids.

42:21.445 --> 42:22.964
We assumed...

42:24.404 --> 42:26.364
We thought you were all...

42:29.164 --> 42:31.084
I'll tell you all about it in the morning.

42:31.324 --> 42:34.604
Right now, the doctor needs
to warm you up a few degrees.

42:38.283 --> 42:40.203
Sub-commander.

42:42.403 --> 42:43.764
Yes?

42:45.444 --> 42:47.884
Isn't there something
you're supposed to say to me?

42:48.964 --> 42:50.204
About what?

42:51.884 --> 42:53.643
Heroics.

42:54.243 --> 42:55.883
Something about heroics.

42:58.083 --> 43:00.283
Good night, lieutenant.

43:06.843 --> 43:08.402
Trip?

43:11.523 --> 43:13.643
Mind if I call you Trip?

43:15.283 --> 43:17.643
Sleep well, my friend.
