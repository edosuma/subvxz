WEBVTT

00:01.620 --> 00:03.890
Y'all come back now, you hear?

00:04.939 --> 00:07.330
Thank you all for coming.
Great PTA meeting.

00:07.420 --> 00:10.490
That vegetarian lasagne was delicious.

00:12.980 --> 00:16.570
And those pork-free pork chops,
that's some good eating.

00:18.220 --> 00:19.730
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:21.460 --> 00:25.420
Dang it, honey, doesn't anybody
in California eat meat any more?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.810
That's a large
pepperoni, sausage pizza

00:28.900 --> 00:32.610
and a big old bucket of bacon
on the side.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.090
l'm sorry.
Did you guys want something?

00:39.700 --> 00:42.340
Now, Lilly,
that's what l love about your mom.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.770
Looks like an angel,
but eats like a truck driver.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.980
Was that supposed to be
a compliment?

00:50.060 --> 00:52.050
From him? Oh, yeah.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.580
Finally, they're gone!

00:55.660 --> 00:58.090
Dad, the next time
you host a PTA meeting,

00:58.180 --> 01:02.300
at least do it out in the hot tub,
so l can see Lilly's mom in...

01:02.940 --> 01:04.500
The kitchen!

01:05.019 --> 01:06.740
Hey, Miss T!

01:06.820 --> 01:08.220
Warn a guy!

01:09.900 --> 01:12.890
And he doesn't have a girlfriend.
Go figure!

01:14.580 --> 01:16.380
Heather, l appreciate
you and Lilly staying over,

01:16.460 --> 01:19.370
but you all don't have to stick around
and help us clean up.

01:19.460 --> 01:22.420
You just want that pizza all to yourself.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.850
That is not true,

01:24.940 --> 01:27.660
but l will wrestle you
for that bucket of bacon.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.650
Why isn't he laughing?

01:31.740 --> 01:34.330
The man don't joke about his bacon.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.370
Jackson, you could help clean up, too,
if you like.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.020
l am helping.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.780
Man, this chocolate pudding
tastes awful.

01:44.860 --> 01:49.250
That's because it's Mrs Devahl's
fast-acting prune butter.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.570
Why do they call it...

01:53.820 --> 01:55.250
Excuse me.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.050
ls it just me, or are they actually
starting to like each other?

02:01.140 --> 02:04.890
You mean like, or like like?

02:06.740 --> 02:10.449
l'll tell you, the best steakhouse in LA,
Jimmy's down on Third.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.530
One time l heard a cow say,

02:12.620 --> 02:15.500
''When l go,
just serve me up at Jimmy's.''

02:17.300 --> 02:19.730
-Like like!
-Like like!

02:19.820 --> 02:22.620
Man, l haven't seen my mom
even look at a guy since the divorce.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.810
lt'd be so cool if they started dating.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.250
lt would be even cooler
if they got married.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.300
-So how about Saturday?
-lt's a date.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.490
-We're gonna be sisters!
-We're gonna be sisters!

02:34.820 --> 02:36.770
What are we eating?

02:36.860 --> 02:38.690
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy!

02:45.260 --> 02:46.820
<i>come on</i>!

02:46.900 --> 02:50.860

03:33.820 --> 03:35.170
Make sure your dad wears his earring.

03:35.260 --> 03:37.010
My mom says
it makes him look like a pirate,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.530
and she loves her pirates.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.850
Perfect! He's always looking
for an excuse to wear his puffy shirt.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.610
Lilly, tell your mom to wear that dress

03:46.700 --> 03:48.650
that she wore
at my folks' Christmas party.

03:48.740 --> 03:50.540
She looked so

03:51.380 --> 03:52.940
holidayish.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.410
v ery festive. l gotta go.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.810
Okay, that was gross,
but he's not wrong about the dress.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.810
-True. After you, sis.
-No, after you, sis.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.770
Tell her not too much perfume.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.690
And she's gonna have
to keep laughing at his jokes,

04:09.780 --> 04:11.850
even when they stop being funny.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.450
And trust me, that day will come.

04:15.500 --> 04:20.130
Okay, perfume, jokes,
Oliver's holiday dress.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.540
You better write me a list,
and l'll write one for you.

04:22.620 --> 04:23.890
Cool.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:34.580 --> 04:38.290
Welcome to the wonderful world
of international relations.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.450
-Good one!
-Well, thank you, Miss Truscott.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.260
lt's always nice to be appreciated.

04:44.340 --> 04:49.250
Now, next week, all of you will be
ambassadors of an imaginary country,

04:49.340 --> 04:52.090
as we try to
resolve problems peacefully.

04:52.180 --> 04:54.740
-This is gonna work great!
-Aye.

04:54.820 --> 04:59.020
And it certainly will if everyone shows
that kind of enthusiasm.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.850
Stewart, Truscott,

05:00.940 --> 05:04.170
the two of you are a great joy
to have in class.

05:04.940 --> 05:06.690
Right back at you!

05:07.220 --> 05:09.570
Why are we a great joy?

05:09.660 --> 05:12.010
l don't know. Keep writing!

05:17.660 --> 05:21.290
Something doesn't look right,
but what?

05:21.380 --> 05:23.050
What could it be?

05:24.060 --> 05:27.770
Maybe it's the annoying little twerp
staring back at you.

05:29.220 --> 05:30.370
No.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.370
lt's the sand around the shack.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.850
lt all just, l don't know, blends in.

05:38.180 --> 05:42.250
That's because
we're, l don't know, on a beach.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.570
Watch and learn, Jackson.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.370
Or in your case, just watch.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.530
Bring it in, Charlie!

05:54.420 --> 05:57.300
Sand. You actually bought sand.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.180
This isn't just sand.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.810
lt's Costa Rican sand.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.660
Finest in the world.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.370
Feel it, smell it, unload it.

06:12.780 --> 06:16.250
-Excuse me?
-Remember to lift with your knees.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.970
l'll lift with my knees, all right.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.170
Now, this l'll be happy to unload.

06:23.260 --> 06:26.570
Let me go! Jackson! Put me down!

06:26.660 --> 06:28.140
l'll put you down.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.250
There. Have fun hanging out.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.250
Jackson, get back here!

06:35.340 --> 06:36.900
You're the worst employee in the world!

06:36.980 --> 06:39.050
That's because
you're the worst boss in the world.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.490
You wouldn't last a week
working for a jerk like you.

06:41.580 --> 06:45.290
And you wouldn't last a week
managing a bonehead like you.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.490
l bet you 50 bucks
you couldn't even last the weekend.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.620
Wait, you're willing
to pay me 50 bucks to switch places?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.050
You are so on.

06:54.140 --> 06:58.450
Fine. For the rest of the weekend,
l'm Jackson, you're Rico.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.130
Now, get me down from here.

07:01.220 --> 07:05.100
Sorry, Jackson.
Rico doesn't take orders from you.

07:05.180 --> 07:07.010
Get yourself down.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.140
Jackson!

07:15.500 --> 07:19.170
Whee, doggies,
it sure feels good to be puffy again!

07:19.980 --> 07:23.020
Yeah, yeah,
you're a regular puff daddy.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.900
Okay, let's review, shall we?

07:24.980 --> 07:28.730
So she loves the Boston Red Sox,
hates when people dress their dogs,

07:28.820 --> 07:31.940
-and her favourite ice-cream is...
-Chocolate crunchy.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.060
Not chocolate crunchy,
it's fudgy munchy!

07:35.780 --> 07:37.660
Sweet niblets.
How'd you get out of high school?

07:37.740 --> 07:42.180
By doing my homework, which is
exactly what you should be doing.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.530
Okay. l'm sorry, Pops,

07:44.620 --> 07:48.900
but, l mean, it's you and Lilly's mom.
lt would be so cool...

07:48.980 --> 07:50.930
Mile, l appreciate the coaching.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.610
l know what you're trying to do,
but let's face it.

07:53.700 --> 07:58.450
l already got the duds and the 'do,
anything else would be just unfair.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.260
Okay, remember, he loves...

08:02.340 --> 08:04.490
Car racing, Lynyrd Skynyrd

08:04.580 --> 08:08.410
and those Japanese game shows
where people fall off logs.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.810
l've never been so proud of you.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.610
Lipstick check.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.140
How you doing?

08:24.340 --> 08:26.330
We're very close.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.850
-Move your finger, honey.
-Oh, right.

08:29.380 --> 08:33.970
-That is one beautiful dress.
-That is one puffy shirt.

08:36.179 --> 08:40.299
-Drive safe!
-Next stop, Sister-town.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.250
-Bye!
-Bye!

08:47.060 --> 08:49.780
Man, Lilly, this is harder than l thought.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.890
lf we just concentrate,
l know we'll figure it out.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.540
l've gone over these numbers 1 0 times.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.090
Once you move in, there is no way
all of our shoes are gonna fit.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.490
Well, what are we gonna do?

09:02.060 --> 09:04.450
l guess l could give some away.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.500
You would give away shoes for me?

09:08.580 --> 09:11.490
-You're the best sister ever!
-l know!

09:13.740 --> 09:16.130
Hold on, l'm getting a video message.

09:16.220 --> 09:19.340
<i>People of Earth</i>,
<i>people of Earth, people of Earth</i>.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.810
<i>Don't be alarmed, it's Mr corelli</i>!

09:25.300 --> 09:27.180
Just a gentle little reminder
to all of you

09:27.260 --> 09:31.970
that lnternational Relations Week
starts on Monday, so be prepared.

09:32.060 --> 09:34.450
Francis, do you want
one fish stick or two?

09:34.540 --> 09:37.010
Not now, Ma! l'm on the computer!

09:37.300 --> 09:39.020
Mr Corelli, over and out.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.850
Four! And don't hog the tartar sauce!

09:43.500 --> 09:45.450
This explains so much.

09:46.180 --> 09:50.650
Once we get our parents together,
we have got to get that man a date.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.010
-They're back!
-They're back!

09:55.100 --> 09:56.820
l can't wait to hear how the date went!

09:56.900 --> 10:00.130
Me neither.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.650
Give them a little space.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.490
They'll let us know how it went
when they're ready.

10:03.580 --> 10:04.850
Okay.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.980
How'd it go? Great? Perfect?
Awesome? Fantastic? Tell me.

10:09.060 --> 10:11.410
Fine. l had a wonderful time.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.130
So did l. Let's go.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.700
-But...
-The woman wants to leave.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.580
Let's not stop her.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.700
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.580
What goofy thing
did your dad do this time?

10:30.660 --> 10:33.970
My dad? How do you know
it was my dad's fault?

10:34.060 --> 10:36.330
Have you met your dad?

10:36.420 --> 10:39.850
Yeah, l have.
And l've also met your uptight mother.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.580
My mother is not uptight.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.380
Lillian, move it!

10:46.700 --> 10:49.500
Yeah, she's a real ray of sunshine.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.650
-This is not her fault!
-lt's not my daddy's fault, either!

10:54.740 --> 10:57.210
l was gonna give up shoes for you.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.290
-Well, now you don't have to.
-Fine.

10:59.380 --> 11:01.130
-Good!
-Goodbye.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.530
She is not uptight!

11:06.900 --> 11:11.020
You know what? l don't need a sister.
l like being an only child.

11:12.900 --> 11:17.020
Hey, Miles, l got a pimple on my back
l can't reach. Could you...

11:19.140 --> 11:21.370
Let me go get my goggles.

11:30.620 --> 11:34.370
Morning, Daddy! l made you breakfast.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.170
Thanks, honey,
but l'm still not gonna tell you.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.810
What happened last night
was between Lilly's mom and me.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.850
And l respect that.

11:44.940 --> 11:48.290
Really? So why did you write
''please, please tell me''

11:48.380 --> 11:50.770
in little tiny pieces of bacon?

11:51.980 --> 11:55.410
'Cause the full strips
would've taken up all the room.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.410
Sorry, honey, this just isn't your fight.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.730
-You're gonna have to stay out of it.
-Get your own darn breakfast.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.330
Fine. Woman insists on paying
half the cheque

12:05.420 --> 12:06.610
and won't take no for an answer.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.580
-lt's ridiculous.
-That's why you're mad?

12:10.380 --> 12:13.260
l said l'm not talking about it.

12:13.340 --> 12:17.620
Man tries to be a gentleman,
and suddenly he's a caveman.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.930
That's what y'all were upset about?

12:19.020 --> 12:21.330
Just because both of you guys
wanted to pay the cheque?

12:21.420 --> 12:24.690
This is so awesome!
l've got to go tell Lilly!

12:24.780 --> 12:28.530
And, Daddy, you might want
to get the shells out of there.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.810
l like my eggs extra crunchy.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.290
Caveman.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.410
She's the one that slapped down
that credit card so fast,

12:38.500 --> 12:41.490
it got meat juice all over my puffy shirt.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.500
-Lilly, l found out everything!
-l know!

12:48.580 --> 12:51.380
l can't believe
they fought over something so stupid.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.530
l know. Now we can still be sisters.

12:53.620 --> 12:57.580
Yeah. All your dad has to do is
apologise for not letting my mom pay.

12:57.660 --> 13:00.540
Uptight momma's daughter say what?

13:00.620 --> 13:03.130
l said your dad just has to apologise.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.130
For what? Being a gentleman?

13:05.220 --> 13:07.410
Your mother's the one
that needs to apologise.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.450
For what?
Asserting her independence?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.210
Well, she asserted it
all over my daddy's little puffy shirt.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.860
-Well, he was being pigheaded!
-He was being polite.

13:15.940 --> 13:19.090
Haven't you ever
heard of Southern hospitality?

13:19.180 --> 13:21.010
Now get off my land!

13:31.660 --> 13:36.690
There, Rico.
That's the last of the sand. Happy?

13:37.780 --> 13:41.210
Something doesn't look right, Jackson.

13:41.300 --> 13:44.050
But what? What could it be?

13:45.100 --> 13:47.330
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.170
The new sand does not please me.
Put it all back.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.530
But l just spent two hours...

13:52.620 --> 13:57.130
Unless you're willing to admit
that you can't take what you dish out!

13:57.660 --> 13:58.930
Never.

14:01.980 --> 14:05.370
Hold up, Jackson.
Let me help you with that.

14:05.940 --> 14:10.220
Wait, l don't help anybody
because l'm Rico.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.970
-So you're Rico?
-Yeah.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.940
-And l'm enjoying every minute of it.
-Yeah?

14:16.020 --> 14:18.900
Well, l'm gonna enjoy every minute
of pounding your face in.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.330
-What?
-You picked on my little brother

14:20.420 --> 14:22.850
-for the last time.
-What little brother?

14:23.500 --> 14:25.930
You remember, don't you, Rico?

14:26.020 --> 14:30.850
The kid with the unibrow, very similar
to this handsome gentleman.

14:31.340 --> 14:35.410
l believe you called it
an eye-eye-eye-brow.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.380
-What did you do?
-Me?

14:41.460 --> 14:44.660
l'm not the one who said ''bring it on''
when the kid told you

14:44.740 --> 14:48.010
his big brother was gonna
beat you up Sunday at noon.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.660
Well, look at that. Right on time.

14:51.580 --> 14:54.170
Wait a minute. He set me up.
He's Rico.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.770
You just love picking on little kids,
don't you?

14:56.860 --> 15:00.770
lt's true. He's a bad man.

15:00.860 --> 15:03.210
Look out!
Move, move, move, move, move!

15:07.380 --> 15:10.930
Nobody does Rico like Rico.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.770
And then she was like...
And then l was like, ''What?''

15:20.860 --> 15:21.850
Chicks.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.900
Hi, Oliver. Ready for
lnternational Relations Week?

15:25.980 --> 15:28.570
Totally.
My country, Okenland, is ready to rock.

15:28.660 --> 15:32.410
We've got... We got gorgeous beaches,
gorgeous girls,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.250
and our main export is love.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.220
Good for you.
Want to hear about Sarahtopia?

15:37.300 --> 15:38.780
Not really.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.620
Our national colour is green,
we only use alternative fuels,

15:42.700 --> 15:46.900
and our chief export is mulch
made from our own waste products.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.210
-You have an army?
-No.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.730
Good luck.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.690
You won't be so smug

15:52.780 --> 15:56.770
when your people get sick of
paying $ 1 8 for a gallon of gas,

15:56.860 --> 15:59.820
revolt and hang you by your thumbs.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.050
Bye!

16:08.220 --> 16:10.730
-You're blocking my locker.
-You're blocking my locker.

16:10.820 --> 16:14.570
Why don't you show some
Southern hospitality and move?

16:14.660 --> 16:16.570
Why don't you assert
your independence and move me?

16:16.660 --> 16:19.330
Okay, what are you two
arguing about this time?

16:19.420 --> 16:22.970
Did somebody forget
their friendship weekiversary?

16:23.060 --> 16:25.130
We don't have
weekiversaries any more

16:25.220 --> 16:26.970
because we are no longer friends.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.460
And this would've been our 200th,

16:28.540 --> 16:31.050
and Lilly would've gotten that
charm bracelet she's been wanting.

16:31.140 --> 16:32.330
Oh, well.

16:33.020 --> 16:37.380
Well, l don't need presents
from someone who insults my family.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.210
-l insulted your family?
-Thanks for admitting it.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.810
l wasn't finished!
Your cheque-grabbing mother...

16:42.900 --> 16:46.050
Your me-man-you-woman pappy.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.970
You know what you two need?

16:48.060 --> 16:50.970
A vacation on the beautiful beaches
of Okenland.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.730
Wear a bikini, get a free churro.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.850
-This isn't funny!
-This isn't funny!

16:54.940 --> 16:56.770
l said it first.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.370
l can sing.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.370
l can sing.

17:05.300 --> 17:09.010
Welcome to the first day
of lnternational Relations Week.

17:11.859 --> 17:16.140
Today, four nations
will demonstrate world trade.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.329
Which will they be?

17:17.420 --> 17:22.010
Well, we have Okenland,

17:22.099 --> 17:25.849
Sarahtopia, Lillitania and...

17:25.940 --> 17:28.740
Somebody else, somebody else,
somebody else, somebody else.

17:28.820 --> 17:31.730
Hello, Milantis!

17:32.860 --> 17:35.690
You know, today is a Milantian holiday.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.980
Banks, post office, all closed.
Please respect our tradition.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.970
Yeah, her old, backwards traditions.

17:43.060 --> 17:48.050
Then again, Milantis is always ready
to stand up for what it believes in.

17:48.820 --> 17:52.250
And those beliefs
will be tested in today's debate

17:52.340 --> 17:55.060
over a big pile of fish!

17:57.300 --> 18:01.130
Sorry, they're a little ripe.
l'm on a teacher's salary.

18:01.220 --> 18:05.260
Now, you four nations
border the Corellian Sea.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.980
Milantis has had
an excellent fishing season

18:08.060 --> 18:11.570
and, holy mackerel, owns all the fish.

18:12.220 --> 18:16.890
What will you do to get what you need?
Let's start trading.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.290
Well, my country
harnesses the power of wind.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.130
We could trade you energy for fish.

18:21.220 --> 18:24.530
Or l could just give you the fish,
because in Milantis,

18:24.620 --> 18:27.260
that's the classy thing to do.

18:28.420 --> 18:31.300
Well, in Lillitania,
we don't take handouts.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.970
We like to pay for our own fish
and half the tip!

18:36.500 --> 18:38.140
lt's not a handout.

18:38.220 --> 18:42.500
lt's a generous, loving gesture
from the people of Milantis,

18:42.580 --> 18:44.530
but l wouldn't expect you
to know anything about that,

18:44.620 --> 18:47.450
since you are from Lilly-tiny-brainia.

18:48.340 --> 18:52.570
Well, at least my country
doesn't sound like a cure for diarrhoea.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.700
l'll take the fish if it gets me an A.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.210
At least Okenland isn't threatened

19:01.300 --> 19:04.050
when someone wants to buy them
one little dinner.

19:04.140 --> 19:08.580
We don't need you buying us anything.
Lillitania is an independent nation!

19:08.660 --> 19:12.780
Milantis is a country rich in tradition!
Now take the dang fish!

19:12.860 --> 19:15.210
l don't want your stinking fish!

19:17.420 --> 19:19.410
This one's mine.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.410
Great, then this one can be yours.

19:23.220 --> 19:26.610
-Cold fish! Cold fish!
-Yeah, just like your mother!

19:28.580 --> 19:30.460
This one's for Mom!

19:33.060 --> 19:36.490
-Well, this one is for Dad!
-No!

19:36.580 --> 19:39.890
-Lilly, chill!
-Guys, l was gonna return those!

19:40.900 --> 19:43.130
Don't be an idiot, just take the fish.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.210
Hey, if she wants to pay, it's her right.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.370
-Well, her right is stupid.
-You're stupid.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.810
Well, that's pretty brave talk
for somebody without an army.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.730
Who needs an army
when you've got an arm?

19:53.780 --> 19:55.050
Gross!

20:00.060 --> 20:03.850
All right, that's it.
l want the fish, and l want them now.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.730
Next time, we're trading cookies.

20:12.820 --> 20:16.330
Guys! Guys!
Can't we all just get along?

20:17.580 --> 20:20.780
Come on. Those are expensive.

20:23.940 --> 20:27.610
-l smell like low tide.
-Me, too...

20:28.860 --> 20:29.850
...na.

20:33.060 --> 20:36.610
-Don't make me laugh, l'm mad at you.
-l'm mad at you.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.650
-Flying fish.
-Flying fish.

20:43.740 --> 20:47.290
-What are we doing?
-Exactly what they're doing in there.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.850
Fighting someone else's stupid fight.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.610
Well, l'm ready to stop if you are.

20:52.700 --> 20:56.330
Well, l gotta be honest.
My dad can be a little bit old-fashioned.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.410
Yeah, my mom
can be a wee bit uptight.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.580
A wee bit? She's a

21:05.460 --> 21:08.810
lovely woman
that can fight her own battles,

21:08.900 --> 21:10.250
just like my daddy.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.810
-Friends?
-Practically sisters.

21:14.380 --> 21:15.940
-Eat it, Oken!
-Help!

21:16.020 --> 21:18.900
l'm being attacked by Sarahtopia!

21:24.780 --> 21:30.220
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t
<i>So let's make it roc</i> k

21:30.300 --> 21:31.370
<i>Let's make it roc</i> k

21:31.460 --> 21:36.820

21:51.780 --> 21:54.770

22:00.500 --> 22:04.570
-Honey, you were on fire tonight.
-l was, wasn't l?

22:04.660 --> 22:07.380
l think it's because l was so happy
Lilly and l made up.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.180
l think it's really great that you and
my mom worked everything out, too.

22:10.260 --> 22:13.250
Yeah, l know. You think
she had a good time at the concert?

22:13.340 --> 22:16.540
Rock and roll! Yeah!

22:18.540 --> 22:20.260
A little bit.
