does Batman have a dossier

01:48.108 --> 01:51.811
on all the high-level criminals
in Gotham?

01:51.911 --> 01:55.148

-Lovely.

<i>as well as an assessment of his</i>
<i>particular form of psychosis,</i>

02:17.003 --> 02:20.039
<i>I can conclude</i>
<i>that Crane's efforts</i>

<i>via the use of proxies.</i>

02:57.076 --> 02:59.012
<i>It is my opinion that Crane</i>

02:59.078 --> 03:02.649

-No, I'm not.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.272
Yes, you are!

03:26.372 --> 03:28.575
You are terrified
of everything in this house,

03:28.675 --> 03:31.377
and I get it, coming home
can do that to a boy.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.581
Everywhere you look,
there he is looking back
at you, judging you.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.250
What does he think of you?
What does he want from you?

03:37.350 --> 03:39.285
Will you ever be good enough?

03:39.385 --> 03:42.422
Well, let me end
your suspense right now.

03:42.522 --> 03:46.960
No, you're never gonna be
good enough for Bruce Wayne.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.563
[exhales]

03:50.630 --> 03:53.066
It's a relief, isn't it?
Like ripping a band-aid off.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.701
Not so bad.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.203
But now that we've addressed
your deep psychological issues,

03:57.270 --> 04:01.374
why don't you go ahead
and get your lazy ass
out of this fucking bed?

04:01.441 --> 04:03.209
We have work to do.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.712
-What work?
-What work? What?

04:05.778 --> 04:07.080
What work?

04:07.146 --> 04:08.615
The same work we've been doing
every single day.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.651
We are trying to save
this godforsaken city.

04:11.751 --> 04:16.122
The next step in our plan,
we have to get rid
of public enemy number one.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.423
That's Nightwing.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.992
That's fucking crazy.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.227
That's right. We're gonna
give the people what they want.

04:21.294 --> 04:24.998
You can be a homicidal maniac.
They don't care.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.500
So long is that they think that
you are on their side,

04:27.600 --> 04:30.637
and Jason, you are.

04:30.737 --> 04:35.241
You're on their side!
You're on their side!

04:35.308 --> 04:38.578
Get up, buttercup.
I got a busy day.

Man, it is bad out there.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.837
Even for Gotham.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.606
I didn't see a single cop.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.374
Most of the stores
are gated up,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.544

some supplies, didn't we, pal?

05:11.644 --> 05:12.945
[barks]

05:13.012 --> 05:14.380
Thanks for the clothes.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.449
I didn't think traipsing
around Gotham in a supersuit

05:16.516 --> 05:18.117
was the greatest idea
right now.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.688
Any luck
tracking down Blackfire?

05:21.788 --> 05:24.557
Or Gar or anyone?

05:24.657 --> 05:28.394
No. Internet's down,
cell phones are down.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.230

must have switched
to an encrypted frequency.

How long do you think
they've been working for Crane?

05:33.533 --> 05:34.534
I don't know.

That's what he wants.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.055
What he expects.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.657
We need to break through
the security system remotely,

at Wayne Enterprises.

no one was there.

I checked the bandages...

I'm just trying
to get home, remember?

What about you?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.777
Looking for the Titans.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.779
I have a lead that says
they might be holed up
in Chinatown.

Chinatown?

09:08.881 --> 09:09.782
That's where I live.

we're gonna find Dick and Kory?

09:24.797 --> 09:25.698
No.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.200
And maybe it's for the best.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.902
Why would you say that?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.904
We might all be safer
on our own.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.410
Rach, things got really bad.

09:37.476 --> 09:41.647
The entire city of Gotham
thinks that this is all
the Titans' fault.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.649
They think we poisoned
the water.

09:46.385 --> 09:47.920
There are people
who want us dead.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.723
Even cops.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.825
[Rachel] I should
never have left you guys.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.660
[Gar] Don't say that.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.395

09:56.462 --> 09:57.897
Nothing to show for it.

09:58.731 --> 09:59.765
But I'm here now,

10:00.933 --> 10:02.335
and I want to help.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.336
Good.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.139
Because I might have something.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.742
It's been bugging me
that Jason just miraculously

10:09.809 --> 10:12.278
returned from the dead,
and no one seems to know how.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.081
So, I did some digging.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.183
I found some of Bruce Wayne's
old journals,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.653
and I found this symbol.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.525

to a place of rebirth.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.161

10:30.963 --> 10:33.666

but I keep thinking, like,

10:33.766 --> 10:36.202
this might be the key
to everything.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.665

out of your rotten mouth
with one hand.

Straighten those
crooked teeth for you.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.250
That's it. I'm gonna
call the cops
if you don't beat it.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.119
I want to buy medicine
for my sick child

12:00.219 --> 12:01.721

to call the police?

15:56.922 --> 15:58.524
And no sign of the Titans?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.626
We don't even think
they're in Gotham
after what happened.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.530
Do you guys have
any Internet? Cell service?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.699
No, we're lucky
we still have electricity

16:06.799 --> 16:08.867
or else it would be
the Middle Ages around here.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.135
We're totally cut off.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.272
Maybe not.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.856
Welcome to my secret base.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.491
I thought we were
storing rice down here.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.459
I moved all that.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.497
[scoffs]

16:39.498 --> 16:41.400
What the hell is all this?

16:41.500 --> 16:45.137
You know how
I'm always talking about
Batman and Robin and stuff,

16:45.204 --> 16:47.673
and I kind of know things
about them?

16:49.041 --> 16:53.312
Well, the thing is,
this is how I know.

16:53.379 --> 16:57.383
I've hacked into
security cameras,
police radios, cell phones,

16:57.483 --> 16:58.984
gathering info
on what they're up to...

16:59.051 --> 17:00.919
What Gotham's up to.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.555
Shortwave.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.424
Do you think
we can raise anyone on this?

17:06.392 --> 17:07.760
I know we can.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.661
Is that what you were doing
the other night?

17:09.728 --> 17:11.597
When you got shot?
Gathering info?

17:11.697 --> 17:14.433
-Mom, no. I was just--
-[Jack] Where did you
even get all this?

17:14.533 --> 17:18.237
I found it, Dad.
In the street at garage sales.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.040
Come on. You think I stole it?

17:21.106 --> 17:23.442
Look, I'm sure you folks have
a lot to catch up on,

17:23.542 --> 17:25.244
but I really need to get
in touch with my team.

17:25.344 --> 17:28.680
So if we could just put
the family drama aside, like--

17:28.747 --> 17:32.551
We didn't know
where you were that night.
We were scared to death.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.286
And then we got the call
from the hospital.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.756
-If that has anything
to do with this--
-That's you.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.560
-Yes.
-[Jack] You're part of this?

17:41.627 --> 17:43.629
Did you know my boy
was out there risking his life?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.098
-We met after.
-Donna is a friend.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.634
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be standing here.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.303
I don't want you
having anything
to do with any of this.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.072
Look, I don't blame you.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.207
I don't even disagree with you.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.644
But whether you approve of it
or not, everything that
your son has down here

17:58.744 --> 18:02.481
is our only chance
of figuring out what the hell
is going on out there.

18:02.581 --> 18:07.319
So if it's all the same to you,
let's crank up this garbage,

18:07.419 --> 18:09.488
and let me get in touch
with my team

18:09.588 --> 18:11.056
and I will get out of
your hair.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.895
This conversation isn't over.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.232
[Tim sighs]

18:22.401 --> 18:23.836
That was a total disaster.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.571
Oh, yeah, big time.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.674
Now, what do you say
we find Nightwing?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.618
[baby crying]

18:42.121 --> 18:44.022
Hey. Hey, excuse me.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.526
Um... I need to speak to you.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.262
Will this buy me five minutes?

18:53.465 --> 18:56.602
I saw your baby in a vision,
and I need to know why.

18:56.668 --> 18:57.870
Are you serious?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.505
I know, I know, I know.
It sounds insane.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.707
It's just, um...

19:01.807 --> 19:04.510
I've been having these bizarre
waking dreams for weeks,

19:04.610 --> 19:07.212
and this is the closest
I've gotten to an answer.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.281
So, could you tell me
who you are?

19:09.348 --> 19:12.885
And if I don't?
Will you burn me up?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.654
I saw the video, Starfire.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.656
I don't have my powers anymore,

19:18.957 --> 19:20.125
but I wouldn't do that.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.161
Whatever you say.

19:30.469 --> 19:34.139
My name's Kapelwa.
This is Maya. That enough?

19:34.206 --> 19:35.674
Why am I seeing her
in my vision?

19:35.741 --> 19:38.076
I don't know.
But as you can see, she's sick.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.545
This city is off its rocker.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.247
I have to take her home
before something happens.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.916
Sorry I couldn't be
of more help.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.884
No, I'm sorry. I don't mean
to hound you. It's just...

19:47.686 --> 19:50.923
These dreams are paralyzing me.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.092
I need to figure out
what they mean
so I can stop them.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.030
Well, Superhero,
welcome to my life.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.565
Nothing makes sense.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.736
Kapelwa.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.773
Funny running into you.
I was just thinking about you.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.875
Hello, Max.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.344
I was gonna call you,
but the phones were all down.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.012
I was hoping I could reach you.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.448
Find out about
that cash flow situation
we got set up.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.951
Yes. And I told you
I would pay you back in a week

20:19.051 --> 20:20.719
when I got my check.

20:20.786 --> 20:24.756
I know, I know,
but with everything
going crazy in town, uh,

20:25.958 --> 20:27.759
I figured
I should get it sooner.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.028
Yes, of course.
It's just that--

20:30.095 --> 20:33.398
You know, everyone said

20:33.465 --> 20:35.968
"Don't drink the water,"

20:36.068 --> 20:37.769
and dumb me,
I forgot. [chuckles]

20:38.804 --> 20:40.472
Turns out, it's not so bad.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.475
I feel great.
Like I could do anything.

20:45.944 --> 20:47.579
Like I could even get
my money tonight.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.447
[gun cocks]

20:48.547 --> 20:50.449
Hey. Hey. Max, listen.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.551
I'm sure we could give you
what you need.

20:53.485 --> 20:54.953
You seem pretty confident.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.989
I know a lot of people
in this city.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.091
Lot of people who can get you
exactly what you want.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.827
Just put the gun down.

21:01.927 --> 21:06.465
I guess I'm not getting paid
unless I shoot someone tonight.

21:48.507 --> 21:49.975
[Kory] What is happening?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.224
Mother?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.793
Hello, my beautiful girl.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.696
My little Princess Koriand'r.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.033
[guard] His Royal Majesty,
King Myand'r.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.305
-My queen, is it--
-A girl!

22:21.907 --> 22:23.175
[exclaims]

22:25.677 --> 22:27.646
[King Myand'r]
Koriand'r, my love.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.378
Your Highness.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.948
It pains me to tell you
your daughter
does not possess that

23:03.048 --> 23:05.183
which the throne
of Tamaran demands

23:05.250 --> 23:08.954
How can that be?
Every member
of the family has--

23:09.054 --> 23:14.393
The fire that burns
within your veins
is absent within this child.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.294
[Queen Luand'r]
You must be mistaken.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.464
[soothsayer] The voice
and vision of X' Hal
is never mistaken.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.434
I am simply his messenger.

23:22.534 --> 23:25.070
If Koriand'r doesn't possess
the power of fire,

23:25.137 --> 23:27.539
she has no claim
to this throne.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.474
This is impossible.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.110
We will not lose this kingdom.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.146
Do you not see it?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.081
Usurpers on all sides?

23:36.148 --> 23:38.917
The need for guarded escort
to your own queen's chamber?

23:44.423 --> 23:50.162
Tell the people that Koriand'r
is the next queen of Tamaran,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.464
and quell any whisper
of revolt.

23:52.564 --> 23:55.500
Your Highness, it is a lie.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.303
[King Myand'r] Yes,
and you will do it.

23:58.403 --> 23:59.638
So says your King.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.147
Blackfire...

24:12.150 --> 24:13.618
Your Highness.

24:13.685 --> 24:15.987
-Yes.
-[soothsayer] Your new child
Komand'r...

24:16.087 --> 24:17.088
What is it?

24:17.155 --> 24:19.191
She possesses the gift of fire.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.129
But Koriand'r
is successor to the throne.

24:25.363 --> 24:27.132
As you commanded.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.536
You can make it,
so that Koriand'r
has the power.

24:31.636 --> 24:35.373
Cast a spell that will take
the gift of fire from Komand'r,

24:35.474 --> 24:37.442
and bestow it upon
her older sister.

24:37.509 --> 24:40.045
[soothsayer] Your Highness,
I must warn you,

24:40.145 --> 24:44.182
this sort of magic
always comes with a price.

24:45.450 --> 24:46.384
Is that a threat?

24:50.455 --> 24:52.557
[soothsayer] Bring
Princess Koriand'r.

25:02.868 --> 25:06.972
May the fire
that burns within Komand'r,

25:10.575 --> 25:13.411
be given to Koriand'r.

25:15.080 --> 25:15.981
No.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.717
No, it can't be.

25:31.396 --> 25:32.264
What the...

26:02.193 --> 26:03.094
Starfire!

26:20.912 --> 26:22.414
[Gar] Hey, Rach,

26:22.480 --> 26:25.216
I'm not getting magical
resurrection vibes here.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.217
[Rachel] I know.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.222
I'm sensing
some strange energy.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.126
Must be pretty dark magic.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.763
I guess bringing people
back from the dead isn't
all sunshine and rainbows.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.571
Smell like bagels to you?

26:46.638 --> 26:49.808
[Rachel] Yeah, Gar, I'm sure
the creepy abandoned building
sells bagels.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.576
[Gar] A simple no
would suffice.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.013
Oh, we're going...

27:01.119 --> 27:02.120
Gar, stay back.

27:03.488 --> 27:04.789
Did you see something?

27:04.856 --> 27:06.791
No, I felt something...

27:09.628 --> 27:10.795
Energy signatures

27:12.163 --> 27:14.032
from people who were here
a long time ago.

27:23.174 --> 27:24.042
After you.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.465
Hello?

27:49.300 --> 27:50.669
Someone order a pizza?

27:54.305 --> 27:55.140
Wow!

27:56.207 --> 27:58.343
What a palace!

27:58.410 --> 28:00.378
-Thank you.
-Oh!

28:00.478 --> 28:02.681
I'm sorry. The front door
was wide open.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.716
Don't be sorry, man.
I left it open.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.252
-Cool.
-So, how much?

28:07.352 --> 28:08.486
Twenty-five.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.188
$25 for a pizza?

28:10.255 --> 28:13.224
-Really?
-Well, I mean, you're kind of
out of the delivery zone,

28:13.324 --> 28:17.095
-so we charge extra for all--
-Buddy, I'm joking, you know?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.530
-Right.
-[both chuckle]

28:18.596 --> 28:20.598
Oh, shit, I forgot
my wallet upstairs.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.267
Hang tight, okay?
I'll get you a big tip.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.334
Oh, sure.

28:24.736 --> 28:25.937
No problem.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.908
[mumbling indistinctly]

28:38.016 --> 28:39.884
-Oh!
-[thuds]

28:45.557 --> 28:47.592
[exhales]

28:47.692 --> 28:49.728
I just love
gourmet kitchens, don't you?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.635
-Did you do it?
-Do what?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.537
Break into the Wayne Manor
security system

28:59.604 --> 29:00.805
like you said
you were going to.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.640
[Dick] Change of plans.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.642
Wait a minute.
You're not really meeting up
with him, are you?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.911
Dick. It's a trap.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.447
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm going.

29:09.547 --> 29:11.316
-So I'm going, too.
-Nope.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.919
Look, I don't mean
to get all Lex Luther on you,

29:14.986 --> 29:16.654
but I'm bigger than you.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.256
I'm stronger than you.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.091
I'm faster than you.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.826
So I am going with you.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.496
And there's really not a thing
you could do to stop me.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.897
I was worried you'd say that.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.309
I'm sorry, Conner.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.480
Sorry. I had no choice.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.282
[whines, barks]

29:45.984 --> 29:47.585
-Hey, buddy,
-[barks]

29:47.652 --> 29:48.486
Hey boy.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.805
All right, Red Hood,
let's finish this.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.642
[breathing heavily]

30:10.708 --> 30:12.043
[muffled screaming]

30:14.345 --> 30:16.548
Now, your night took
a little bit of a detour,
didn't it?

30:16.648 --> 30:17.782
[Owen groaning]

30:17.849 --> 30:19.217
But I can assure you,

30:19.317 --> 30:23.321
everything is happening
for very good reason.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.291
You should be
as excited as I am right now.

30:26.357 --> 30:28.860
[shouting] 'Cause you're
in the Batcave!

30:28.960 --> 30:32.230
And we have a chance
to prove the Batman wrong.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.365
[Owen continues groaning]

30:37.702 --> 30:40.205
We have a chance to prove
that I can elicit

30:41.339 --> 30:43.875
as much fear as Scarecrow can.

30:45.643 --> 30:46.845
So...

30:46.911 --> 30:49.147
[muffled groaning]

30:49.214 --> 30:51.216
[Crane] Which one
scares you the most?

30:51.316 --> 30:54.219
Maybe a little slice
down the cheek?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.656
What if I took off
one of your ears?

31:00.091 --> 31:01.059
Maybe...

31:02.193 --> 31:05.029
-[Crane laughing]
-[Owen] No. No, No.

31:05.096 --> 31:07.665
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

31:09.734 --> 31:12.437
See? We're a good team.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.440
You and me. Look at us.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.544
And all of this screaming,
the squirming, this fighting,
this shouting, this crying,

31:19.611 --> 31:21.012
it's wonderful.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.548
Keep it coming. I need
the positive reinforcement.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.284
Okay.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.120
Here we go. Here we go.

31:30.255 --> 31:31.689
[muffled screaming]

31:33.558 --> 31:35.059
Okay, come on.

31:36.094 --> 31:37.195
Motherfucker!

31:38.963 --> 31:40.765
Okay, okay.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.768
Okay. You can do this.

31:44.769 --> 31:47.071
All right, here we go.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.477
Still weak.

31:53.378 --> 31:54.312
Who's here?

31:55.713 --> 31:56.581
Who said that?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.287
-You.
-No!

32:03.254 --> 32:04.322
Why did you say that?

32:04.422 --> 32:05.556
[grunts] Okay.

32:05.623 --> 32:06.791
Answer me. Shut up!

32:06.891 --> 32:08.293
[whimpering]

32:08.393 --> 32:10.161
You sound just like
my fucking mother.

32:11.129 --> 32:12.563
Your mother was right.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.565
[Owen crying]

32:21.272 --> 32:23.474
No. No!

32:23.574 --> 32:25.176
No. No!

32:25.276 --> 32:26.244
<i>No.</i>

32:26.945 --> 32:29.013
<i>No!</i>

32:29.113 --> 32:30.982
[Donna] You sure
they saw Nightwing?

32:31.082 --> 32:34.686
[Tim] The guy said he saw him
heading downtown.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.021
Does that mean he's really
planning to fight Red Hood?

32:37.121 --> 32:39.757
I don't know, but I'm not gonna
let him do it by himself.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.494
I guess this is it.

32:43.594 --> 32:44.996
-Hey.
-See you down the-- Okay.

32:45.863 --> 32:46.998
[knock on door]

32:47.098 --> 32:48.533
[cop 1] GCPD, open up!

32:53.037 --> 32:53.938
[Jack exhales]

33:15.393 --> 33:17.328
Hi, guys. Can I help you?

33:17.395 --> 33:20.064
Just on our rounds.
Checking to see who's home.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.299
Doing okay in there?

33:21.366 --> 33:22.367
We're doing all right.

33:23.401 --> 33:24.836
How many folks
you got in there?

33:24.902 --> 33:26.137
Just me and my family.

33:27.638 --> 33:28.973
Water situation?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.641
[Jack] We've got enough
of the bottled stuff.

33:30.708 --> 33:31.843
What about out there?

33:31.909 --> 33:34.412
What's happening?
We heard gunshots.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.380
Looters.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.384
You have any way to defend
yourselves? Any weapons?

33:39.484 --> 33:40.818
[Jack] Nothing in here.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.854
[cop 2] We'll keep you
on our regular beat then.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.090
Anyone comes by,
you hang tight
till we get here.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.692
You have
a nice night, Mr. Drake.

33:52.563 --> 33:53.931
What the hell was that about?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.168
They come by every six hours
like clockwork.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.202
And I don't like it.

33:58.269 --> 33:59.704
Why are they checking on you?

33:59.771 --> 34:01.339
Because they're
up to something.

34:01.406 --> 34:02.707
What are you talking about?

34:02.774 --> 34:05.676
We have someone
inside GCPD headquarters.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.179
Says Crane wants to
wipe out neighborhoods
holding out.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.448
So they're making plans
to raid the armory.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.517
Place is full of
high powered weapons.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.551
Assault shit.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.255
Looks like
they're coming for us.

34:19.924 --> 34:20.892
This is us.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.861
And that's the armory.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.797
If they're cleaning house,
they'd start with these cells.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.965
You really think they're just
gonna come down here

34:29.400 --> 34:31.569
and start killing people?

34:31.636 --> 34:34.138
When's the last time anyone's
heard from Barbara Gordon?

34:34.238 --> 34:36.641
They arrested her
the night the Titans
tried to turn themselves in

34:36.741 --> 34:37.875
and everything went to shit.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.311
Well, if you're right,

34:40.411 --> 34:42.880
and Crane's got these cops
on his payroll,

34:42.947 --> 34:44.749
they're his eyes
and ears on the street.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.253
With them, he can control
the whole damn city.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.922
That's why they're
making rounds.

34:52.323 --> 34:53.658
Gathering information,

34:53.758 --> 34:55.159
finding out how many people
are in each cell,

34:55.259 --> 34:56.461
what kinda weapons they have.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.664
Crane's one inch from winning.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.399
His only conceivable threat

35:02.633 --> 35:04.969
are these hold-out cells.

35:05.069 --> 35:06.437
[Stephen] So he's gonna
shut them down.

35:07.905 --> 35:08.773
Permanently.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.442
You gotta to get out of here.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.978
-What?
-Go stop Nightwing,
bring him back here.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.114
It's almost midnight.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.851
Those cops could
come back any minute.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.752
[Stephen] Not if they're
starting north of Harper.

35:21.819 --> 35:23.421
We've got some time.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.789
We can hold them off
for a while.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.124
I have people
inside the buildings.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.359
We got this.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.361
This is my block, my home.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.630
This is why I came back.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.135
Look, I don't know, Tim.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.975
If we can coordinate
with these cells,

35:44.041 --> 35:46.110
then maybe there's a way
we can actually fight back.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.713
Against 100 cops?

35:48.813 --> 35:50.281
I spent half my life
on an island

35:50.348 --> 35:52.850
learning how to lead
five people against 50.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.820
Or 50 against 500.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.725
Maybe it's time I started
putting it to use.

36:02.527 --> 36:03.628
[bats squeaking]

36:23.080 --> 36:24.382
[Rachel] Bats?

36:24.482 --> 36:26.417
[Gar] I swear they keep
following me everywhere.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.425
[Rachel] We found it.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.029
[Gar] The Lazarus Pit.

36:50.775 --> 36:53.211
Don't worry,
it's from a bottle.

36:53.277 --> 36:54.679
[Maya crying]

37:00.551 --> 37:01.686
[Kory] Is she feeling better?

37:04.522 --> 37:05.790
[groans]

37:05.890 --> 37:07.592
I was just about to
ask you the same thing.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.628
I was shot.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.129
[Kapelwa] But you didn't fall.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.032
This bright, blue light
came out of your body.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.968
It took out Max.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.403
-But--
-It healed me.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.473
You saved us.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.375
So does this mean
your powers are back?

37:26.544 --> 37:27.979
Yes, I guess.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.314
They're different.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.383
When I was shot,
I had another vision.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.652
Not of Maya,
this time it was of myself.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.991
I found out that
the powers I lost

37:40.091 --> 37:42.493
weren't really mine
to begin with.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.061
They belong to someone else.

37:46.664 --> 37:47.999
So these are new powers.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.167
That blue light?

37:50.901 --> 37:51.769
Not new.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.941
They were with me all along.

37:57.808 --> 37:58.676
The real me.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.144
[Maya crying]

38:04.915 --> 38:05.983
[groans softly]

38:08.786 --> 38:09.620
[exhales]

38:11.255 --> 38:12.957
[crying]

38:16.494 --> 38:17.762
[Kapelwa shushes]

38:26.203 --> 38:27.705
That was over a year ago,

38:27.805 --> 38:31.609
before my husband spoke out
against the president,

38:31.676 --> 38:35.446
before he and our son, Lutangu,
were taken away.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.616
So you fled when
you were pregnant.

38:38.683 --> 38:41.519
They were going to
arrest me, too.
I had to leave that day.

38:42.553 --> 38:43.654
Never saw them again.

38:45.890 --> 38:50.061
Maya is the last tangible part
of my old life,

38:52.296 --> 38:55.132
and the entirety of my new one.

38:55.199 --> 38:58.402
This beautiful light
was already inside me.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.572
I just didn't know it yet.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.548
I'm glad we met, Starfire.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.253
I am, too.

39:28.532 --> 39:29.700
You were right, Mom.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.572
I'm just a coward.

39:34.672 --> 39:35.606
You know.

39:36.273 --> 39:37.441
I know what?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.243
[Alter Crane]
<i>What you have to do.</i>

39:39.343 --> 39:41.045
The time for masks is over.

40:17.314 --> 40:20.050
-[stabbing]
-[Owen screaming]

40:23.788 --> 40:25.423
[screaming fades]

40:32.663 --> 40:34.131
[Nightwing]
<i>Tick-tock, Red hood.</i>

40:35.099 --> 40:36.333
<i>Your time is running out.</i>

40:38.302 --> 40:41.605
[laughs]<i> You were never</i>
<i>very good at this game.</i>

40:43.741 --> 40:45.276
<i>You always fell for the bait.</i>

40:52.249 --> 40:53.083
[grunts]

41:10.601 --> 41:13.170
So that's how
it's going down now.

41:13.270 --> 41:15.539
No more playing by the rules,
ol' Dickie Grayson?

41:16.941 --> 41:18.709
Standard bat shit.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.544
Intimidation through terror.

41:27.384 --> 41:28.652
[gun firing]

41:41.699 --> 41:43.200
[Red Hood] You hiding
out there, Dick?

41:44.335 --> 41:45.202
Huh?

41:46.637 --> 41:48.339
[Nightwing] I'm just
setting the stage.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.018
Right on time.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.156
[gun firing]

42:11.395 --> 42:12.830
[electricity crackling]

42:14.431 --> 42:15.766
[both grunting]

42:23.774 --> 42:25.342
[both grunting]

42:31.248 --> 42:32.883
[electricity crackling]

42:36.387 --> 42:38.022
[both grunting]

42:38.088 --> 42:39.790
[indistinct chatter]

42:42.426 --> 42:43.761
[bystander 1] Leave him alone!

42:57.141 --> 42:58.442
[both grunting]

43:16.260 --> 43:17.761
[crowd gasping]

43:27.237 --> 43:29.740
[gasps, coughs]

43:31.942 --> 43:34.678
Just remember,
I did this to you.

43:35.512 --> 43:36.814
You did this to yourself.

43:38.415 --> 43:39.483
Finish it.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.858
[Red Hood coughing]

43:52.296 --> 43:54.298
[bystander 2] We want you
out of here, Nightwing!

43:55.966 --> 43:56.867
[gunshot]

44:01.538 --> 44:02.373
Easy.

44:03.374 --> 44:04.608
I'm not here to hurt you.

44:05.542 --> 44:06.710
Kid, put the gun down.

44:09.113 --> 44:09.980
[gun cocks]

44:16.320 --> 44:17.454
[gun fires]

44:33.370 --> 44:34.405
I did it for you.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.076
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:39.176 --> 44:41.845
[crowd chanting]
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:42.680 --> 44:46.016
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:46.083 --> 44:50.087
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:50.187 --> 44:53.757
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:53.857 --> 44:57.594
Red Hood! Red Hood!

44:57.695 --> 45:00.998
Red Hood! Red Hood!

45:01.065 --> 45:03.267
[chanting continues]

45:32.029 --> 45:33.097
Uh, Rach.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.067
What's going on?

45:37.935 --> 45:39.369
It's Dick.

45:39.436 --> 45:40.871
Something's happening to him.

45:42.139 --> 45:43.941
[indistinct chatter]

45:46.210 --> 45:47.311
[screams]

45:49.279 --> 45:50.914
[screaming continues]

46:20.944 --> 46:21.845
[Crane] Jason.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.260
Ah, finally home.

46:36.326 --> 46:39.196
Finally home.
See you lost the hood, too.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.264
Good call.

46:40.964 --> 46:41.965
You know,

46:43.500 --> 46:46.470
the time for masks is over.
