<i>My name
is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:10.873 --> 00:13.459
<i>I'm married,
I live in a small town,</i>

00:14.402 --> 00:16.116
<i>and I own
an antique shop.</i>

00:16.140 --> 00:18.105
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:18.135 --> 00:22.523
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:26.681
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

00:27.111 --> 00:29.583
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

00:29.585 --> 00:31.891
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

00:34.728 --> 00:39.961
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:42.122 --> 00:44.969
Are you serious?
Tonight?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.653
Yes, I've been dying
to see it.

00:48.536 --> 00:50.553
Are you kidding me,
I would love to.

00:50.596 --> 00:54.323
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll call you if the chest comes in.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.711
Yeah. We haven't
been to a movie in like 6 years.

00:56.748 --> 00:59.062
Oh, all right, maybe it's been
more like a month.

01:00.025 --> 01:02.343
No, it's a great idea.
It is.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.190
I'll close up early.

01:04.227 --> 01:07.430
You know, I'm sorry to cut you short,
but I have a little bit of a situation here.

01:07.475 --> 01:08.631
Yeah, I'll see you
at the house. Bye.

01:08.665 --> 01:11.331
Hey, do you really think
that I can't see what you're doing?

01:12.778 --> 01:15.031
First, no skates
in the store.

01:15.068 --> 01:17.251
They're heelys
not skates.

01:17.285 --> 01:21.532
All right, no wheels on your
feet allowed and, no shoplifting.

01:21.567 --> 01:22.671
I was gonna pay for it.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.010
You just didn't give me
the chance.

01:24.058 --> 01:26.040
They're $275 a piece.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.681
And the register is that way,
not out on the street.

01:28.716 --> 01:29.611
Whatever.

01:29.776 --> 01:31.932
- What's your phone number?
- Why?

01:31.967 --> 01:33.003
I'm calling your parents.

01:33.045 --> 01:35.101
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

01:36.547 --> 01:39.050
Look, my mother's sick.

01:39.427 --> 01:42.613
Real sick. And this
would really upset her.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.910
Do you really think
that I'm that out of it?

01:44.956 --> 01:47.511
Do you think that i am so un
hip that i would fall for that?

01:47.546 --> 01:48.412
Yeah.

01:48.447 --> 01:50.251
- What's your name?
- Ned.

01:50.296 --> 01:51.723
Ned, give me
your phone number,

01:51.757 --> 01:54.460
or I will take you and your
heelys down to the police station.

01:56.415 --> 01:58.303
I am so sorry.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.273
He has never done
anything like this before.

02:00.307 --> 02:01.042
No, it's fine.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.541
I just thought that you
would want to know.

02:02.586 --> 02:03.461
I was gonna
pay for them.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.942
Ned. It's not like he doesn't have
a ton of this stuff anyway.

02:08.164 --> 02:09.500
He's got
signed guitar picks,

02:09.536 --> 02:12.082
keith moon's drumsticks,
old ticket stubs.

02:12.316 --> 02:14.183
None of it stolen,
by the way.

02:15.406 --> 02:19.521
He will never come back in here
again, I can promise you that.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.272
I'm gonna go
wait outside.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.151
You don't have to
do that. He's welcome.

02:23.188 --> 02:25.731
Just with shoes
minus wheels.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.912
- You have kids?
- No.

02:29.827 --> 02:32.342
- No, not yet.
- Well, they're great.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.862
Until they become
teenagers.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.472
And then you realize
you're just being

02:36.515 --> 02:39.202
paid back double for all the rotten
things you did as a teenager.

02:39.237 --> 02:40.651
He seems like a good kid.

02:41.115 --> 02:42.721
He is. He is.

02:43.188 --> 02:45.340
It's just been a little
tough lately, you know?

02:45.615 --> 02:49.630
He's been so moody. He doesn't talk,
he hardly sleeps.

02:49.668 --> 02:53.050
'S just like his whole life
is this big secret all of a sudden.

02:54.178 --> 02:56.981
Anyway, you have
to get back to work, so do I.

02:58.426 --> 02:59.762
I'm Delia Banks
by the way.

02:59.797 --> 03:01.662
Oh, Melinda Gordon.
Nice to meet you.

03:01.708 --> 03:02.680
You look familiar.

03:02.717 --> 03:05.103
I run the real estate office
on the other side of the square.

03:05.147 --> 03:07.891
Oh, well, I'll see you
at village java.

03:07.928 --> 03:09.480
Every chance I get.

03:09.996 --> 03:12.150
Thank you.
And, uh...

03:12.188 --> 03:14.392
I guess I'll see you
around campus.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.778 --> 05:07.580
you know, this was fun.
We should do this like once a week.

05:07.585 --> 05:09.342
Yeah, just not
the same movie.

05:09.386 --> 05:11.110
- I liked it.
- Hey, so did I.

05:11.357 --> 05:12.363
I saw you sleeping.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.670
I was burning
certain scenes into my memory.

05:15.715 --> 05:16.790
Yeah, well, you're tired.

05:16.836 --> 05:18.362
You worked your ass off
this weekend.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.572
Hey, I had
a shoplifter today.

05:21.028 --> 05:24.392
Shoplifting  is something I just don't
associate with antiques, you know?

05:24.445 --> 05:25.620
I think I'm just
gonna take this

05:25.656 --> 05:27.922
chippendale dresser
and stuff it into my jacket.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.203
Yeah, right. It was grateful dead
backstage passes.

05:30.236 --> 05:31.150
At least he had
good taste.

05:31.185 --> 05:32.912
Yeah, he was a kid.
I called his mother.

05:33.086 --> 05:35.090
Ooh, something no thief
worth his salt wants to have happen.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.680
Delia Banks. She's great.

05:36.728 --> 05:38.540
She sells real estate
in town.

05:42.358 --> 05:44.601
Um... yes?

05:45.148 --> 05:46.953
I just thought
maybe I...

05:47.645 --> 05:49.441
hit something
on my way here.

05:49.485 --> 05:51.812
- An animal?
- No. More like someone

05:51.848 --> 05:54.141
who used to be alive
and now isn'T.

05:54.425 --> 05:55.750
Is that what we're
calling ghosts now?

05:55.787 --> 05:57.042
Yeah, I got bored
of calling them ghosts.

05:57.076 --> 05:59.291
Wait a minute,
you tell me about the shoplifter,

05:59.338 --> 06:01.513
but you don't tell me
about the ex living person?

06:01.545 --> 06:03.183
Well, there won't be
a lawsuit.

06:04.967 --> 06:08.053
Sometimes I think a lawsuit would
be easier. What happened?

06:08.097 --> 06:10.922
Do you really want me to tell you
about every single ghost I run across?

06:10.957 --> 06:13.761
Or run over.
Absolutely not.

06:13.948 --> 06:15.543
I prefer to be on
a need to know basis.

06:15.586 --> 06:16.972
Good. Then you drive.

07:39.346 --> 07:42.142
- Hey.
- I'm not a thief.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.000
Glad to hear it.

07:44.775 --> 07:46.472
Shouldn't you be in school?

07:46.517 --> 07:48.290
What, are you gonna
call my mom again?

07:48.417 --> 07:50.181
Can I ask you a question?

07:50.367 --> 07:52.790
If you're not a thief,
then why did you steal

07:52.835 --> 07:55.233
- ... those backstage passes?
- I don't know.

07:55.556 --> 07:57.470
I just felt like
I should have them.

07:57.515 --> 07:58.520
Not you.

07:58.888 --> 08:01.650
Your mom says you have
a lot of that stuff. You collect it?

08:03.927 --> 08:06.511
- What about your dad?
- What about him?

08:06.545 --> 08:09.561
- Where is he?
- In the ground.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.823
Oh, well, that,
that must be hard for you.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.612
For your mom.

08:18.587 --> 08:20.172
He liked old things.

08:20.948 --> 08:23.041
- Look, if you want-
- I gotta go.

08:25.768 --> 08:28.292
Want to check
my pockets?

09:24.086 --> 09:25.991
Jim?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.462
Jim?

09:57.876 --> 10:00.452
What is it? What?
Come on.

10:11.657 --> 10:14.072
Ok. It's need to know time.

10:15.736 --> 10:18.172
29th doesn't mean anything?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.213
No.  Other than the fact
that it's next friday.

10:20.257 --> 10:21.753
A birthday.
A day somebody died.

10:21.785 --> 10:23.140
Well,  it could be
any of those things.

10:23.188 --> 10:25.403
But until this guy
talks to me, we can only guess.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.173
What?

10:29.788 --> 10:32.073
I don't know, it's just...
another...

10:33.196 --> 10:36.483
another formally
alive person. In our house.

10:36.775 --> 10:38.511
Why can't our home
be off limits?

10:38.548 --> 10:40.270
I don't like it any more
than you do, trust me,

10:40.307 --> 10:41.990
but maybe this guy
doesn't know where he is.

10:42.025 --> 10:43.051
Or what's going on.

10:43.087 --> 10:45.303
It's like he doesn't
actually want me to see him.

10:45.336 --> 10:47.513
Like some kind of
hide and seek game he's playing.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.803
Sometimes spirits
have a kind of amnesia,

10:49.845 --> 10:52.023
and they need time
to figure things out.

10:52.067 --> 10:55.202
Maybe he's hoping that this date
will spark something.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.043
Well, it certainly
sparked something.

10:58.082 --> 10:59.859
Is this because
I was in the shower?

10:59.887 --> 11:03.033
- You're afraid that-
- No. It's just about boundaries.

11:03.666 --> 11:05.553
They don't belong
in our home.

11:06.206 --> 11:08.202
I'm sorry that I have to
burden you with this.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.092
Hey, it's no burden.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.993
I'm just used to
having andrea

11:12.037 --> 11:13.872
to puzzle these things
out with.

11:14.645 --> 11:18.641
Oh, babe...
I know. I know.

11:32.437 --> 11:35.492
- Who are you?
- I'm not sure.

11:35.807 --> 11:38.881
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

11:39.926 --> 11:42.090
Do you know why
you came to me?

11:42.908 --> 11:45.502
- You can help me.
- How?

11:48.658 --> 11:53.163
How did you die?
Were you hit by a car?

11:53.198 --> 11:54.621
I think so.

11:57.155 --> 11:59.631
I don't remember
everything exactly.

12:00.038 --> 12:02.700
What does
september 29th mean?

12:03.777 --> 12:06.293
- Don't you know?
- No.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.243
Then I don't either.

12:09.176 --> 12:11.102
Do you have a family?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.662
Does someone know
what happened to you?

12:13.696 --> 12:16.970
I had a wife.
In eastwick.

12:17.248 --> 12:20.323
- Maine?
- She may not know. Will you tell her?

12:20.396 --> 12:22.691
Well, I'm sure you had
I.D. On you.

12:22.737 --> 12:24.380
The police have probably
called her by now.

12:24.417 --> 12:28.052
I was no good to her. I hurt her.
I have to say I'm sorry.

12:28.087 --> 12:31.211
- Do you remember her name?
- Donna. Donna ellis.

12:31.256 --> 12:32.702
And what's your name?

12:33.345 --> 12:35.203
I think people
callede mac.

12:35.245 --> 12:37.971
Well, mac, eastwick is not
exactly around the corner,

12:38.005 --> 12:40.703
- so I don't know that I-
- You have to find her.

12:40.758 --> 12:43.140
- See her.
- Why?

12:43.178 --> 12:45.542
It's important.

12:45.685 --> 12:48.053
- Are you open?
- I'll be right with you.

13:00.327 --> 13:02.591
I took a guess.
Mocha latte.

13:02.637 --> 13:04.603
Oh, works for me.
That's so nice.

13:04.637 --> 13:06.572
Consider it
a peace offering.

13:06.928 --> 13:10.570
I think my son paid you
another visit the other day.

13:12.235 --> 13:14.550
Oh... man, he's good.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.351
We were talking
the whole time.

13:16.397 --> 13:18.131
Yes. It makes a mother proud.

13:18.578 --> 13:20.462
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of it.

13:20.505 --> 13:23.752
No, no. I am so grateful
that you're not upset.

13:25.855 --> 13:28.731
Honestly, I don't know
what his problem is.

13:29.106 --> 13:31.812
He mentioned that his father
had passed away.

13:32.735 --> 13:36.581
3 years ago. It has been really
hard on him.

13:36.896 --> 13:38.360
For you, too.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.391
The shoplifting
helps a lot.

13:41.835 --> 13:47.090
- Good to know.
- I don't mean to pry but...

13:48.885 --> 13:52.193
you lost your partner
recently, didn't you?

13:54.136 --> 13:56.960
Yeah. She was like
a sister to me.

13:59.368 --> 14:02.890
Well, I am right
across the square,

14:02.937 --> 14:04.773
so if you ever need anything...

14:04.815 --> 14:08.423
or you just want to grab
a cup of coffee.

14:08.716 --> 14:10.622
Thanks for
bringing this back.

14:10.658 --> 14:13.563
I tried to make ned do it,
but, you know.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.012
I know.

14:17.005 --> 14:21.831
Does he ever say that he can feel
his father's presence?

14:22.907 --> 14:24.433
Presence?

14:24.725 --> 14:27.190
Like he's around,
you know.

14:27.238 --> 14:31.301
- Watching over him.
- He doesn't say it, but

14:31.348 --> 14:34.672
I think he does.
Sometimes I do, too.

14:35.186 --> 14:39.062
Or at least I wish for it so badly,
that I think I do.

14:40.585 --> 14:42.593
I just wanted to thank you.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.770
I know it sounds crazy,
but he asked me to go to maine.

14:52.807 --> 14:54.933
Maine? As in new england?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.553
Yeah, and you know
what's crazier?

14:56.588 --> 14:57.782
I think I should do it.

14:57.816 --> 14:59.520
You know, this is
one of the reasons why

14:59.556 --> 15:01.230
mr. Alexander graham bell
was so excited

15:01.266 --> 15:02.871
about his new invention
because you can just

15:02.908 --> 15:05.070
pick one of these things up
and call people instead of-

15:05.117 --> 15:07.251
you know what, it is hard enough
to do this in person.

15:07.295 --> 15:08.690
Never mind on the phone.

15:08.737 --> 15:10.063
How are you gonna find her?

15:10.096 --> 15:11.780
Well, he gave me a name,
the town,

15:11.817 --> 15:13.730
and there's that other
little invention, the internet.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.810
I just think it's a long
way to go for a ghost,

15:16.855 --> 15:18.771
a being who no longer
occupies the visual world.

15:18.808 --> 15:20.513
Well, that's true,
but to be honest with you,

15:20.545 --> 15:22.213
I kind of want to get
this guy crossed over.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.593
There's something
off about him.

15:23.638 --> 15:25.383
- Besides being dead?
- You are hilarious.

15:25.426 --> 15:26.861
It's like he's holding
something back,

15:26.897 --> 15:28.263
and you know what,
either I do this thing,

15:28.298 --> 15:31.360
or I don't do this thing,
but I can't just say local calls only.

15:31.405 --> 15:35.483
Well, I think there should be some
metaphysical frequent flyer miles involved.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.440
****
It's pretty nice there this time of year.

15:38.488 --> 15:41.053
Maybe yoshould
come with me. Change of scenery.

15:41.238 --> 15:44.293
I'm back on sundays
starting tomorrow.

15:46.177 --> 15:49.362
You should go.
You're right.

15:50.348 --> 15:52.123
It'll do you good.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.031
I'll call you
a million times.

17:07.846 --> 17:08.823
Yes?

17:09.065 --> 17:11.682
Oh,  um, sorry.

17:11.828 --> 17:14.222
- Are you donna ellis?
- Yes.

17:14.224 --> 17:17.431
I was hoping I could
talk to you for a minute.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.653
Uh, sure. About what?

17:20.234 --> 17:24.573
About your husband,
and please, accept my condolences.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.000
Condolences?

17:27.326 --> 17:29.460
I- I'm sorry.
What is this about?

17:30.045 --> 17:32.050
Well, I assumed you knew.

17:32.095 --> 17:35.471
- Knew what?
- Your husband.

17:36.527 --> 17:39.220
That your husband
passed away.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.321
What? What are
you talking about?

17:42.335 --> 17:47.770
- You didn't know?
- How? When?

17:47.778 --> 17:50.382
Um, he was hit by a car.

17:50.388 --> 17:52.530
I'm so sorry.
I thought that-

17:52.568 --> 17:54.671
where is he?
Where is he!?

17:56.638 --> 18:01.183
Michael? Michael.
You're ok.

18:01.937 --> 18:02.711
I'm fine.

18:02.718 --> 18:04.621
Wait. That's your husband?

18:04.627 --> 18:07.623
Yes. This woman came here
and just said that you,

18:07.628 --> 18:08.690
she said that you
were dead.

18:08.698 --> 18:10.792
That you had been hit
by a car.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.952
No, I'm sorry.

18:12.957 --> 18:15.143
Why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

18:15.146 --> 18:16.740
It was a mistake.

18:16.745 --> 18:21.741
I guess. I...
I don't know what to say.

18:26.315 --> 18:29.860
I Just don't get it, I had the right name,
and I had the right address.

18:29.865 --> 18:31.582
<i>Well, maybe he's confused.</i>

18:31.595 --> 18:33.840
You said sometimes they don't know
what's happened.

18:33.845 --> 18:35.843
No, I think this guy
knows exactly what's happening.

18:35.847 --> 18:37.130
I think I'm just
being played.

18:37.135 --> 18:39.612
Oh, conned by a ghost, huh?

18:39.718 --> 18:41.470
That's not gonna look
very good on a resume.

18:41.478 --> 18:43.713
Sure. Laugh at my misery,
but you should've been here.

18:43.717 --> 18:45.860
It was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.

18:46.055 --> 18:48.441
Why is this guy
manipulating me like this?

18:48.446 --> 18:49.842
Look, just come home.

18:49.846 --> 18:52.313
Come  home. I'll be off
by breakfast time.

18:53.627 --> 18:55.883
No. It's getting late.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.612
I'm too stressed
to drive.

18:57.816 --> 19:02.190
I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to get
a room and start fresh in the morning.

19:03.155 --> 19:06.660
Ok. Just call me before
you go to sleep.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.061
Ok.

19:39.686 --> 19:41.491
Excuse me.

19:41.495 --> 19:43.010
Please leave me alone.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.941
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about that.

19:44.946 --> 19:46.440
It was
an honest mistake.

19:46.446 --> 19:47.970
Ok, look, I don't know
who you are,

19:47.975 --> 19:51.033
or what your problem is, but if you don't
leave me alone, I'm calling the police.

19:51.047 --> 19:51.651
Understood?

19:51.656 --> 19:53.532
Do you know a man
named mac?

19:58.335 --> 20:01.201
- Do you mean my ex husband?
- Ex?

20:01.487 --> 20:03.862
I thought
it was your husband.

20:03.868 --> 20:05.610
Has something
happened to him?

20:05.625 --> 20:07.291
Yes, I'm sorry.
He died.

20:08.116 --> 20:11.031
He was hit by a car.
I came a long way to tell you that.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.262
Why?

20:13.527 --> 20:15.342
Because he wants you
to know.

20:15.636 --> 20:19.331
He feels really bad about the way that
he treated you, and he wants to apologize.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.871
You're speaking
in the present tense.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.251
- Yes.
- But he's dead.

20:23.257 --> 20:26.671
- Yes.
- Who the hell are you?

20:26.675 --> 20:28.652
He wants to say
he's sorry.

20:28.657 --> 20:31.921
It's what he needs to have closure
so that he can move on.

20:31.927 --> 20:34.232
I can help you
talk to him if you'll just let me.

20:36.817 --> 20:39.023
I need you
to stay away from me.

20:39.026 --> 20:41.112
Even if I believed
any of this,

20:42.177 --> 20:43.973
mac put me through hell
in our marriage,

20:43.985 --> 20:46.671
and I have nothing
to say to him.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.871
And I don't care what he
has to say to me.

21:03.947 --> 21:06.221
Nobody's seen her
for 3 or 4 days.

21:06.457 --> 21:08.881
She don't answer door,
she don't answer phone.

21:09.865 --> 21:11.713
Nobody else is asking
around for her,

21:11.757 --> 21:14.733
so I use key
just to check up.

21:32.215 --> 21:34.720
She's gone.
1, 2 days probably.

21:34.766 --> 21:36.002
Heart attack?

21:36.005 --> 21:37.230
I think so.

21:37.237 --> 21:40.121
You want to go downstairs and call this
in. I'll get going on the paperwork.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.771
Yeah, ok.

21:47.357 --> 21:48.813
Ve a nice trip.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.410
She's mine.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.011
Leave her.

22:22.526 --> 22:24.490
Oh, come on.
Talk to me.

22:24.496 --> 22:26.221
You think this is funny?

22:26.225 --> 22:29.102
Making me tell that poor woman
that her husband is dead?

22:29.107 --> 22:30.893
Let me in on the joke, pal.

22:35.177 --> 22:37.243
This doesn't mean that i
believe any of this.

22:37.245 --> 22:41.713
But just, by chance, if it's true, I
thought I should hear what you had to say.

22:42.296 --> 22:44.563
I'm glad you came.
Come in.

22:47.415 --> 22:49.152
Where the hell
have you been?

22:49.158 --> 22:51.662
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.370
So how does this work?

22:56.385 --> 22:58.120
Tell her
she looks good.

22:59.526 --> 23:01.160
He says
you look good.

23:01.165 --> 23:03.891
So he's here, like now?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.760
All right, if he's here,
then...

23:06.765 --> 23:10.132
why don't you ask him to tell you
what happened to our marriage.

23:13.418 --> 23:16.752
Um, he said that you
were married 3 years ago.

23:16.758 --> 23:18.202
That you moved
to this town together,

23:18.208 --> 23:19.680
in the same house
that you live in now,

23:19.685 --> 23:21.251
and then you
divorced him a year later.

23:21.257 --> 23:22.560
Ask him why.

23:23.337 --> 23:24.632
I don't remember.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.042
He says he doesn't
remember.

23:26.045 --> 23:28.922
Well, I remember. He was obsessed
with another woman.

23:28.926 --> 23:31.541
- He cheated on you?
- No, not like that.

23:31.546 --> 23:33.882
That would've almost
been easier.

23:34.055 --> 23:37.652
Instead I had to compete
with the memory of his ex girlfriend.

23:38.278 --> 23:40.240
He didn't realize
how hung up on her he was.

23:40.247 --> 23:42.722
It was like he just
couldn't get her out of his mind.

23:43.137 --> 23:46.571
He was constantly comparing me to her
and talking about her.

23:46.576 --> 23:47.860
I tried to
make it work.

23:47.867 --> 23:49.882
He said that he tried
to make it work.

23:49.885 --> 23:51.640
Oh, bull, you just went
through the motions, mac.

23:51.657 --> 23:53.642
And sometimes not even that.

23:53.647 --> 23:56.330
I don't even understand why
you wasted your time with me.

23:57.207 --> 23:59.041
Do you know how he ended it?

23:59.046 --> 24:02.473
I told him that, you know, maybe we
should take some time apart,

24:02.477 --> 24:06.083
so that he could figure out
what, or who he really wanted.

24:06.828 --> 24:11.381
And he just said, ok.
Let's get a divorce.

24:11.995 --> 24:14.921
Just like that,
like it was nothing.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.512
He should've just gone out
and found that girl

24:18.518 --> 24:20.883
and just figured it out,
but instead, you used me,

24:20.885 --> 24:23.131
and you made me feel like
I didn't count for anything.

24:23.135 --> 24:25.052
I did find the girl.

24:25.147 --> 24:26.411
What?

24:26.418 --> 24:28.652
I did find the girl
I was in love with.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.611
Who  I'm still in love with.

24:38.196 --> 24:40.762
I should've never
let you go.

24:42.606 --> 24:47.312
Kyle?
Kyle mccall?

24:52.175 --> 24:55.813
Just call him kyle?
No one's called him that since college.

24:55.845 --> 24:57.153
We all called him mac.

24:59.135 --> 25:02.752
Tell her you know me. Tell her you're
the one I never got over after we broke up.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.782
Why? What's he saying?

25:06.757 --> 25:09.480
that he's sorry
for the way that he treated you,

25:09.516 --> 25:12.972
and he hopes
that you can forgive him.

25:13.325 --> 25:15.371
Right?
You can do that?

25:15.418 --> 25:16.920
She's not really
the forgiving type.

25:16.966 --> 25:18.150
I can't believe you.

25:18.197 --> 25:19.613
Ok, this is just
too weird.

25:19.616 --> 25:21.492
I gotta get out of here.

25:21.877 --> 25:24.153
And if this is real,
which I highly doubt,

25:24.157 --> 25:26.382
tell him that
I don't forgive him.

25:26.385 --> 25:29.392
He was an idiot then,
and he's probably still an idiot now.

25:32.518 --> 25:34.492
- You played me.
- You're mad.

25:34.497 --> 25:36.161
I could never stand
to make you mad.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.603
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

25:37.606 --> 25:39.692
Why did you send me
to your ex wife?

25:39.695 --> 25:42.481
Don't you know?
Can't you see it?

25:42.488 --> 25:46.343
- See what?
- You just don't understand.

25:46.967 --> 25:51.420
No...
damn it.

25:51.808 --> 25:53.040
Kyle mccall.

25:53.628 --> 25:55.023
You told me about this guy.

25:55.027 --> 25:56.743
You went out with him
in college.

25:57.368 --> 26:00.630
- You said he hurt you.
- Yeah. That was an understatement.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.952
Kyle was the first guy that I
thought I was really in love with.

26:04.227 --> 26:06.913
Believe me, I did not
trust easily.

26:07.746 --> 26:10.370
We were together
for a whole year in college.

26:10.495 --> 26:11.990
He was complicated.

26:11.995 --> 26:14.972
One of those tortured souls
you think you can save.

26:14.975 --> 26:18.873
I thought if I opened myself up to him,
that if I took a risk and told him my secret,

26:19.377 --> 26:21.512
it would show him how much
I believed in him.

26:21.605 --> 26:22.871
In us.

26:23.825 --> 26:26.412
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.703
You really believe
you can do this?

26:27.706 --> 26:29.020
Kyle, I do it
all the time.

26:29.028 --> 26:30.550
- See dead people.
- Yes.

26:30.555 --> 26:34.131
- Talk to dead people.
- Don't say it like I'm crazy.

26:34.137 --> 26:35.742
You're thinking it,
aren't you?

26:35.746 --> 26:37.373
- What?
- That I'm crazy.

26:37.376 --> 26:38.232
I didn't say that.

26:38.236 --> 26:39.771
Well, I can see that
you're thinking it.

26:39.777 --> 26:41.001
Well, what am I
supposed to think?

26:41.005 --> 26:42.310
That I wouldn't
lie to you.

26:42.315 --> 26:44.243
And that I'm not crazy.
Stuff like that.

26:44.247 --> 26:47.012
Do you...
talk to ghosts a lot?

26:47.015 --> 26:50.231
- More than I want to.
- Like every day, once a week?

26:50.238 --> 26:51.593
Third tuesday of the month?

26:51.598 --> 26:54.220
I try not to speak to them
unless they speak to me.

26:54.227 --> 26:57.110
- And what do they talk about?
- All kinds of things.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.843
Mostly they need help.

26:58.845 --> 27:01.702
I have to help them
cross over into the light.

27:03.078 --> 27:04.262
Yeah.

27:04.267 --> 27:06.452
I knew it was too good
to be true.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.652
- What?
- You.

27:08.978 --> 27:12.922
Us... I thought I
met the perfect girl.

27:12.926 --> 27:14.392
Kyle, wait, I know that you
don't believe me,

27:14.395 --> 27:17.271
but please don't walk away.
Just talk to me.

27:17.286 --> 27:19.451
Yeah. Maybe when I'm dead.

27:25.466 --> 27:26.712
That was it.

27:26.718 --> 27:31.572
Never called me, never came to
see me again after a year.

27:31.915 --> 27:33.901
- Still hurts?
- I guess.

27:33.936 --> 27:36.652
A little.
First cut and all that.

27:37.297 --> 27:38.800
And now he wants
a second chance.

27:39.775 --> 27:43.103
I guess that explains the talking corpse
I had to deal with last night.

27:43.408 --> 27:46.801
I'm sorry, jim. I wish that you never
had to deal with any of this.

27:47.326 --> 27:48.673
Keeps things fresh.

27:48.705 --> 27:50.573
You were my second chance.

27:50.606 --> 27:52.391
I mean, you know that,
right?

27:52.435 --> 27:55.611
I never thought that i was going to be
able to trust anyone again after kyle.

27:56.788 --> 27:58.323
And then there was jim.

27:58.717 --> 28:00.470
You're not gonna break into
song right now, are you?

28:00.508 --> 28:01.432
I might.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.792
Now what are we gonna do
about this guy though?

28:07.827 --> 28:10.290
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my sense of humor.

28:11.047 --> 28:14.781
I'll get him to cross over
and out of our lives, I promise.

28:24.767 --> 28:27.841
All right, can you tell me
what the hell it is with these passes?

28:27.888 --> 28:31.113
Dude, these are mine
from my collection.

28:31.178 --> 28:34.870
Dude, I bought those
at a trade show in philadelphia.

28:35.265 --> 28:36.843
I know. My mom,

28:36.876 --> 28:38.981
she sold my whole collection
after I died,

28:40.117 --> 28:43.090
and it got spread out all over the
place and this is the last of it.

28:43.128 --> 28:45.452
You've been tracking
the whole collection?

28:45.496 --> 28:48.300
Each and every single
piece meant so much to me.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.870
My mother,
she never got that.

28:49.907 --> 28:51.373
So she sold them
to some guy,

28:51.405 --> 28:54.933
and he sold it to another guy,
and... my collection.

28:54.975 --> 28:56.993
- What's your name?
- Jamey barton.

28:57.035 --> 28:58.343
- You heard of me?
- No.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.212
why are you still here?

29:01.256 --> 29:03.672
I gotta make sure this stuff gets
to the right people.

29:03.705 --> 29:05.021
People who care,
people who know

29:05.058 --> 29:06.261
what it means, you know?

29:06.298 --> 29:08.581
Hmm. So that's why you
attached yourself to ned.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.180
And here I thought the whole time that
it was his father who was haunting him.

29:11.446 --> 29:13.532
Maybe I'm losing
my touch lately.

29:13.636 --> 29:15.473
You see, I hang out
at concerts,

29:15.507 --> 29:18.463
and I try to get, you know,
a feel for the kids.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.280
And then I try to get
the right kid a piece of the collection.

29:21.317 --> 29:25.033
Well, you'll be happy to know ned has been
a real trouper about getting these passes.

29:25.287 --> 29:26.623
That's my boy.

29:26.836 --> 29:28.542
You're making him
a thief.

29:28.578 --> 29:31.050
It's not like I can just
slip him the cash, can I?

29:31.096 --> 29:32.723
How did you get him
to do it?

29:32.767 --> 29:37.570
Well, I wait till he falls asleep, and then I
whisper in his ear all freaking night long.

29:37.638 --> 29:38.972
"Steal the passes,
dude.

29:39.018 --> 29:42.143
Steal the passes, dude. "
It's how I used to rember lyrics.

29:42.186 --> 29:43.952
Well, he's not gonna
steal the passes from me,

29:43.987 --> 29:45.383
and you have to
leave him alone.

29:45.418 --> 29:47.802
You're messing with his energy.
He doesn't even know why.

29:48.135 --> 29:50.562
It's time for you to go
to the big arena in the sky.

29:50.816 --> 29:52.210
No can do.

29:52.256 --> 29:54.141
I mean, he's the one
for these passes.

29:54.186 --> 29:55.563
He understands.

29:55.988 --> 29:59.163
I can't go anywhere until the last
of my collection is in the right hands,

29:59.207 --> 30:02.273
so whoa, 3 o'clock already.

30:02.937 --> 30:04.090
Note to self.

30:04.128 --> 30:06.121
I gotta keep better
track of time.

30:06.126 --> 30:10.011
He's getting out of school
right now, and so, I gotta skate.

30:59.368 --> 31:01.071
Come on, kyle.

31:01.575 --> 31:05.111
We have to talk about this. I can't help
you if I don't know what you want.

31:05.758 --> 31:08.223
You could've told me
how great it is to be dead.

31:08.256 --> 31:10.460
Go anywhere I want.
No travel time.

31:11.148 --> 31:13.880
No one can see me.
Well, almost no one.

31:14.806 --> 31:18.471
I've had more fun being dead so far
than the entire time I was alive.

31:18.505 --> 31:19.752
What do you want?

31:19.786 --> 31:21.742
I was on my way
to see you, you know.

31:22.385 --> 31:25.131
- The day I died.
- Why?

31:28.655 --> 31:30.001
I saw you on the news.

31:30.045 --> 31:33.390
<i>All I can say is that
people in this town are strong.</i>

31:33.426 --> 31:36.401
<i>They're survivors,
and we'll be ok.</i>

31:37.068 --> 31:38.910
What's with you
and this chick?

31:39.186 --> 31:42.582
Melinda? It's like
you're obsessed with her.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.100
I wanted to see how
things turned out for you.

31:46.288 --> 31:48.761
Things turned out
pretty good for me.

31:49.035 --> 31:50.611
I see that.

31:51.467 --> 31:53.403
Not so much
for me though.

31:56.418 --> 31:58.690
And how is that
my problem, kyle?

31:58.726 --> 32:01.403
Look, I made a big mistake
the day I let you go.

32:01.446 --> 32:03.333
I didn't realize that
right away.

32:03.366 --> 32:05.183
- Yeah, you moved on.
- But I didn'T.

32:05.225 --> 32:07.711
- You married donna.
- Yeah, another mistake.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.902
Donna looked like you,
I thought maybe somehow

32:09.935 --> 32:11.281
I could turn her
into you.

32:11.327 --> 32:12.792
It was a disaster.

32:12.796 --> 32:14.782
That's why I wanted you
to meet her.

32:14.996 --> 32:18.712
So you could see that I was
just trying to recreate you.

32:19.508 --> 32:23.981
You affected
every part of my life.

32:24.246 --> 32:27.310
You made me feel like a freak,
and that I didn't deserve to be loved.

32:27.348 --> 32:28.832
I gave you everything.

32:29.235 --> 32:31.380
Even the one secret
that I never wanted

32:31.417 --> 32:33.523
anyone to know,
and you threw me away.

32:33.628 --> 32:35.492
It was so easy for you.

32:35.576 --> 32:38.212
You want to talk about
a ripple effect?

32:38.445 --> 32:39.971
I'm sorry.

32:40.808 --> 32:42.072
I really am. I was stupid.

32:42.115 --> 32:44.430
I had no idea
what I was throwing away.

32:49.168 --> 32:52.991
But don't tell me you didn't
think about me once in awhile.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.810
Remember how we used to
make fun of the space needle?

32:58.057 --> 33:00.623
Remember that movie theatre
in queen anne?

33:00.937 --> 33:03.480
- The uptown.
- The uptown, right.

33:03.518 --> 33:06.422
How many rainy afternoons
did we spend there?

33:07.546 --> 33:10.070
Watching the worst
movies ever.

33:11.118 --> 33:13.980
You used to hate that.
*****

33:16.146 --> 33:18.321
You convinced me to stop
wearing socks.

33:18.355 --> 33:21.711
You though my feet looked
sexy in sneakers without socks.

33:28.147 --> 33:30.222
You remember
that book store?

33:30.686 --> 33:32.532
In pioneer square.

33:37.636 --> 33:39.451
None of that matters now.

33:39.715 --> 33:42.901
But it does.
It should.

33:44.126 --> 33:46.782
I remember the first day
I talked to you in class.

33:46.828 --> 33:50.573
The way you looked at me.
Those eyes.

33:51.706 --> 33:53.580
I remember thinking
to myself,

33:54.175 --> 33:57.030
now I know what it's like
to really be looked at.

33:59.627 --> 34:01.912
No one's ever looked at me
like that since.

34:01.937 --> 34:04.223
It's over.
You made your choice.

34:04.268 --> 34:06.392
There's no going back,
and I'm happy now.

34:06.736 --> 34:10.112
I found a man that I love
more than I ever thought was possible.

34:10.147 --> 34:11.440
But it's not over.

34:12.678 --> 34:14.543
We can be together now.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.531
Like it was
supposed to be.

34:16.567 --> 34:18.449
Are you listening
to me, kyle?

34:18.485 --> 34:21.540
I'm happily married.
And you're dead.

34:22.648 --> 34:25.413
September 29th is the day
we broke up.

34:26.047 --> 34:29.801
And september 29th is gonna be
the day we get back together.

34:39.628 --> 34:41.672
Are you gonna belate tonight?

34:41.717 --> 34:44.183
Uh, I don't know. Friday nights
can be a little heavy.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.092
Well, tonight would be
a good night to be late.

34:46.125 --> 34:46.951
Why?

34:47.177 --> 34:48.553
Because it's september 29th,

34:48.587 --> 34:50.821
and he's got something planned,
I just don't know what.

34:51.536 --> 34:54.801
Well...
I should be here.

34:54.907 --> 34:57.473
- This guy feels like trouble.
- It's my deal, ok?

34:57.507 --> 35:00.141
I have to solve it, and besides,
he's really not that bad of a guy.

35:00.177 --> 35:01.302
He would never hurt me.

35:01.337 --> 35:03.352
Mel, you and this guy,
is there...

35:04.418 --> 35:06.713
I can't believe
I'm asking this about a ghost.

35:06.965 --> 35:09.272
Is there still
something between you?

35:09.308 --> 35:11.572
- What?
- I heard you last night.

35:11.618 --> 35:12.693
Jim, he's dead.

35:12.738 --> 35:14.242
There was a time
in my life when that

35:14.276 --> 35:15.790
meant case closed,
but then I met you.

35:15.826 --> 35:17.261
One or two laughs
with kyle mccall

35:17.305 --> 35:20.053
dead or alive will never compare
to what we have.

35:20.086 --> 35:21.562
There was more depth
on our first date

35:21.605 --> 35:24.923
than I ever had with kyle,
the problem is he doesn't get that.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.540
All right. Be careful.

35:31.636 --> 35:33.842
- Call me if you need me.
- Yeah.

35:57.415 --> 35:59.102
Ned, it's no big deal.

35:59.135 --> 36:01.203
You've just got to go in there
and take those passes.

36:01.245 --> 36:03.333
Technically, it's not
even really stealing

36:03.375 --> 36:04.521
because those passes
are mine,

36:04.556 --> 36:06.522
in the big picture,
we're like one, you know, so...

36:10.857 --> 36:13.543
- that was harsh.
- They're yours.

36:14.358 --> 36:17.350
- Righteous.
- Why?

36:17.818 --> 36:19.460
Sometimes my job
is about making sure

36:19.496 --> 36:22.082
that the right people
end up with the right things.

36:22.677 --> 36:24.181
Something tells me
that whoever owned them

36:24.226 --> 36:25.563
would want you
to have them.

36:26.297 --> 36:27.311
Seriously?

36:27.346 --> 36:28.641
They're not for free.

36:28.685 --> 36:32.422
I need some help
at the store on saturdays,

36:32.468 --> 36:36.172
- For let's say, a month.
- I don't know.

36:36.206 --> 36:38.722
Is that like
minimum wage, or...

36:38.765 --> 36:45.282
- all right. Don't push it.
- Ok. So... thanks.

36:49.466 --> 36:52.422
Slickly done, I must say.
Slickly done.

36:52.456 --> 36:55.900
Oh, thank you.
Whoa.

36:57.575 --> 37:00.392
That is one bright light.

37:02.177 --> 37:05.133
Yeah. The ultimate,
all access pass.

37:09.166 --> 37:11.893
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

37:15.115 --> 37:18.110
<i>Check, check,
check one, check two.</i>

38:17.157 --> 38:18.530
Stop it!

38:20.666 --> 38:23.510
Leave my husband's
stuff alone!

38:45.478 --> 38:47.921
******

38:51.635 --> 38:53.550
Kyle, you have to stop
doing this.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.833
You cannot just erase jim by getting
rid of everything that he owns.

38:56.878 --> 38:58.200
Obviously, one of us
has to go,

38:58.245 --> 39:01.010
and it's not gonna be me.
Not this time.

39:01.685 --> 39:04.540
- Jim is not going anywhere.
- I love you, Melinda.

39:04.588 --> 39:06.420
You have no idea
what love is.

39:06.727 --> 39:09.443
I'm here, and he isn't,
so that's a good start.

39:09.478 --> 39:11.923
He's not here
because he loves me.

39:12.256 --> 39:14.960
I asked him to give me some space,
and he gave it to me.

39:14.995 --> 39:17.563
- How is that love?
- That's just part of it.

39:17.595 --> 39:21.081
And it's not the greeting cards
and sunset and flowers part.

39:21.115 --> 39:22.683
That's easy.
That's not real.

39:22.726 --> 39:24.991
It's about doing the things that you
don't want to do.

39:25.036 --> 39:26.823
The stuff that
makes you mad.

39:26.957 --> 39:29.131
The stuff that you do
without even being asked.

39:29.177 --> 39:30.992
It's about having a friend
and knowing when to shut up.

39:31.038 --> 39:33.360
You know, I can't tell you
what love is.

39:33.407 --> 39:36.030
I can only tell you
what it isn't, and this is not it.

39:36.065 --> 39:37.580
No, but you're wrong, Melinda.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.733
I will never forget
the look in your eyes

39:39.765 --> 39:41.572
when you walked away
from me.

39:41.608 --> 39:43.611
- What look?
- Relief.

39:43.978 --> 39:45.160
You were relieved.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.470
To not have to risk
being in an honest relationship.

39:47.516 --> 39:48.890
To not have to give
anything up.

39:48.937 --> 39:50.801
To be able to blame
somebody else so you could be safe.

39:50.845 --> 39:51.950
That's a lie.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.601
Your ex wife told me that you did
exactly the same thing to her.

39:54.636 --> 39:57.423
The first time that she called you on
the way you treated her, you left.

39:57.905 --> 39:59.791
Just like me.
You call that love?

39:59.826 --> 40:01.673
Yeah, but I missed you
every day.

40:01.716 --> 40:03.572
I knew I had made a mistake.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.183
That's because you had
already thrown me away.

40:06.227 --> 40:07.960
I could be imaginary.

40:10.185 --> 40:12.501
Was I that forgettable?

40:16.878 --> 40:18.812
I hated myself for it.

40:20.747 --> 40:22.723
I wanted to call you
a hundred times.

40:22.756 --> 40:24.471
It would've been too late.

40:25.188 --> 40:28.421
You did what you did, I saw what I saw.
There was never any going back.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.300
Now I'm starting to hate
being dead.

40:35.537 --> 40:36.721
Why?

40:37.547 --> 40:40.941
Because the answer
to everything is too late.

40:40.975 --> 40:42.493
Too late to fix
the mistakes.

40:42.528 --> 40:46.673
Too late to catch up
with the things you missed.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.902
Too late to make things
right with the people you hurt.

40:54.837 --> 40:56.801
Too late...

40:57.355 --> 40:59.850
to love you the way
he does.

41:01.226 --> 41:06.763
The beauty part
of my job is, kyle, it's never too late.

41:09.647 --> 41:11.152
You wasted a trip.

41:11.388 --> 41:13.390
I have nothing to gain
by talking to him.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.413
Look, maybe you don't
have anything to gain.

41:15.445 --> 41:17.253
Maybe you just have
something to lose.

41:17.326 --> 41:22.502
A little piece of anger
or bitterness, or disappointment.

41:22.928 --> 41:25.272
He hurt me so much.

41:26.086 --> 41:27.833
You know what,
he hurt me, too.

41:28.946 --> 41:31.822
But you know
what happened, I got stronger.

41:31.868 --> 41:34.182
I met the perfect
man for me.

41:34.215 --> 41:37.101
Found a beautiful place to live,
and you, you're married again.

41:37.465 --> 41:39.111
I saw how much
you loved your husband

41:39.156 --> 41:41.070
when you thought
that he was dead,

41:41.107 --> 41:42.993
and would you really
be this happy

41:43.027 --> 41:44.980
if you were still
with kyle?

41:46.715 --> 41:50.410
Would I?
Transformation.

41:50.446 --> 41:55.051
Sometimes turns out to be
better than you could've imagined.

41:56.095 --> 41:59.102
He just wants the chance
to say that he's sorry.

41:59.465 --> 42:02.791
He's right behind you,
and he's ready to do that.

42:02.945 --> 42:04.741
I screwed up, donna.

42:05.365 --> 42:07.471
I was scared. I took
the easy way out.

42:09.037 --> 42:10.671
I'm so sorry.

42:10.956 --> 42:12.672
He knows
that he screwed up.

42:12.707 --> 42:14.381
You son of a bitch, kyle.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.271
Didn't you know...
how much I loved you?

42:21.718 --> 42:23.482
What I would've
done for you?

42:25.116 --> 42:30.713
How could you...
how could you just throw that away?

42:31.676 --> 42:33.801
I'm glad you're happy now.

42:34.428 --> 42:36.421
You're better off
without me.

42:36.466 --> 42:38.432
He's glad that
you're happy now.

42:38.478 --> 42:40.032
You're better off.

42:40.895 --> 42:42.451
Yeah, well...

42:43.366 --> 42:46.401
I guess I'll never
really know.

42:48.157 --> 42:52.753
- I know.
- He knows.

42:54.206 --> 42:55.861
Can I go now?

43:05.287 --> 43:07.242
Time to cross over.

43:07.945 --> 43:10.733
You ever think I'll get
a second chance?

43:11.138 --> 43:14.321
Come back here again
and do this right?

43:16.795 --> 43:19.832
It's really nice
to think so.

43:38.136 --> 43:41.202
You were never forgettable.

43:42.305 --> 43:48.794
