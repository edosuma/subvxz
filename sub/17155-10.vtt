Guys, where are you?

00:03.125 --> 00:04.792
-We're right here.
-Sounds great, man.

00:04.875 --> 00:06.458
No, it doesn't because
it's missing something...

00:06.542 --> 00:08.083
Like the rest of the band.
I got it!

00:08.166 --> 00:10.709
-You got what?
-The lyrics for the song.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.542
and you're already hugging Vanessa Page?

00:17.625 --> 00:21.417
Rock stars care about two things, OK:
themselves and their hair.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.208
Is this what you guys do all day,
sit around and eat junk food?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.250
I'm actually starring in a movie.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.834
Wait, are you guys
starring in a movie too? I forget.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.250
No, we're all just extras
in <i>The Joe Show.</i>

-[groans]
-Cool, pancakes.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.542
No, don't! Stella's Aunt Lisa made them,
they taste like feet.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.375
They can't be that bad.

00:48.875 --> 00:50.834
I've never tried a foot before, but...

00:50.917 --> 00:52.166
-That is a foot.
-Yeah.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.125
-So, you like them?
-Delicious, Aunt Lisa.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.875
-Mmm.
-It's the pickled bean paste.

00:57.959 --> 01:00.500
I'm gonna make some for Stella and Macy.
See you boys.

Mantra wants to meet with me
for our next album.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.959
Dude, he's like the greatest
music producer ever.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.041
Stones, Peas, JT.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.667
Yeah, everything he touches
turns to gold.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.917
-I wish he'd touch those pancakes.
-You want to eat gold pancakes?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.375
No, I want to sell them
and get good pancakes.

-What are you doing?
-Practicing my flips.

01:36.041 --> 01:39.500
-I gotta get back in shape for the tour.
-Well, you didn't quite stick the landing.

It's a good thing Big Man's

Yeah, well, laugh it up now, brother,
but I'm gonna get my flip back

all the fans will love me the most.

-Getting interviewed by Movie Brat.
-I am getting interviewed by...

03:05.667 --> 03:07.709
Wait. How did you know that?

03:07.792 --> 03:09.625
-It was already on her blog.
-Oh.

03:09.709 --> 03:11.750
Whatever's going on in Hollywood,
Movie Brat's on it.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.125
She's kind of my idol.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.834
Well, Mona set it up for me.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.333
I'm supposed to get Movie Brat
excited about <i>Forever April.</i>

03:18.417 --> 03:21.041
Well, the Brat's tough.
I mean, if she doesn't like you,

03:21.125 --> 03:22.667
she could trash you and your movie.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.834
Well, I guess I'll just have to
turn on the charm, right? [chuckles]

03:25.917 --> 03:28.417
Oh, so it's just...
It's just that easy, huh?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.625
Sometimes even easier.
[chuckles]

03:30.709 --> 03:33.959
Wow, how does such a scrawny neck
hold such a big head?

03:34.041 --> 03:39.375
Stells, Stellarooni, I guarantee
Movie Brat will be putty in my hands.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.625
And I don't have a scrawny neck.

03:42.333 --> 03:47.250
Joe, not every girl in the world
finds this charming.

03:47.333 --> 03:51.542
Really? Because if I recall correctly,
you found this pretty awesome.

03:51.625 --> 03:57.333
And this... is why this...
went like this... poof.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.166
OK.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.583
There's the famous Kevin backflip.

[sighs] I'm a little rusty, so thanks
for training me, Big Man.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, thanks for crushing my petunias.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.250
-And I'm sorry about that.
-Accidents happen.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.667
OK, let's get to work.
If I'm gonna get my flip back,

04:16.750 --> 04:17.917
-you're gonna have to push me.
-Done.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.875
OK, that means no matter
how much I beg and plead,

04:19.959 --> 04:21.542
-you don't stop.
-Not a problem.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.000
All right, what's first?
Um, balance, agility... oh, strength.

-Medicine ball.
-What? [grunts]

04:28.750 --> 04:30.625
-[doorbell rings]
-Got it!

04:30.709 --> 04:32.250
Because no one else is here.

Well, hello there.
You must be the famous Movie Brat.

You know, I've been to your website,

-[giggles]
-Please don't type that.

05:19.750 --> 05:20.792
That was kinda lame.

-Aw, I think you look adorable.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.875
OK, adorable's not the goal here.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.250
I'm meeting with Mantra today.
I need to look cool.

05:38.333 --> 05:41.875
-You know, rock and roll.
-Well, you can be all that and adorable.

05:41.959 --> 05:44.041
Come on, Mace. Mantra could
take our band to the next level.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.458
-Of adorability?
-Seriously.

05:46.542 --> 05:49.250
Nick, Mantra called you, OK?
He's already sold.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.250
So, just go on with your old bad self.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.917
You're the best.
Thank you.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.834
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you sure I look all right?

05:57.917 --> 06:02.250
Nick, trust me, the last thing Mantra's
going to care about is your shirt.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.667
-Nick! Mantra.
-Pleasure.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.667
Ew, that shirt, it's disrupting my groove.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.875
-Oh, it's too adorable, I knew it.
-No need to apologize.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.709
Be a good Jonas and pop this on.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.125
Huh.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.875
All right, a sleeve at a time.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.417
Nick, I'm ready to receive your music.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.333
-Here you go.
-A compacted disc!

06:35.417 --> 06:37.333
Perfection.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.834
Actually, that's not
meant to be a coaster--

06:40.917 --> 06:42.458
Let me hear your song.

06:44.166 --> 06:48.083
-I don't know how to play this.
-Then let it play you.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.125
-[discordant music]
-No more! All right.

06:53.208 --> 06:56.291
Just a tiny bit.
Right out of the gate.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.709
Ah, yes!
Cool, Nick.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.625
Can't play it, please.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.458
Oh, I'm weakened.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.291
Sounds like you've had
an incredible summer, Joe.

[sniffs]

07:10.625 --> 07:11.500
[sighs]

07:11.583 --> 07:14.709
Yeah, it's been amazing.
I'm actually starring in <i>Forever April,</i>

07:14.792 --> 07:17.875
-directed by the great Mona Klein.
-Mona, how is she?

07:17.959 --> 07:21.917
Did she ever recover after I shredded
that awful movie of hers?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.667
What was it called? It was like...

07:24.125 --> 07:27.875
<i>-Soccer Squirrels 2?</i>
<i>-Nuts in New York.</i>

07:27.959 --> 07:30.917
[chuckles] You know, I never
would have had to destroy her film

07:31.000 --> 07:33.458
if she hadn't snubbed me
at that premiere. [laughs]

07:33.542 --> 07:36.625
Glad she finally learned
how this game is played.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.583
Wow, you're kinda scary.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.125
But in a fun way, like Halloween.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.917
[laughs]

07:43.000 --> 07:44.709
Oh, this is good right here. Sit!

07:44.792 --> 07:46.166
-There!
-OK.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.709
Perfect.

07:48.792 --> 07:51.417
-So, about <i>Forever April--</i>
-Uh, later.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.875
First we're gonna do the good stuff:
you and Vanessa page.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.083
Are just co-stars and friends.

07:57.166 --> 08:01.959
-Because you just broke up with her.
-How did you know that?

08:02.667 --> 08:05.792
I have an army of brats
all over this town, Joe.

08:05.875 --> 08:09.083
-Wow, you are good.
-And you are single.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.834
-OK, so about <i>Forever April.</i>
-What kind of girls do you like?

08:15.291 --> 08:17.166
Girls that can't wait
to see <i>Forever April.</i>

08:17.250 --> 08:19.125
I can't wait to see <i>Forever April.</i>

08:19.208 --> 08:21.166
Great, then I guess you're my type.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.834
Can I get a picture of you?
For the... website?

08:25.125 --> 08:26.250
Sure.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.792
Say <i>Forever April!</i>

08:30.875 --> 08:33.750
With a big smile, Joe, lots of teeth.

My glutes are on fire.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.417
-Can we take a break?
-No!

08:44.500 --> 08:47.458
-But I'm in pain.
-So are my petunias.

08:47.542 --> 08:49.166
[groans]

08:51.375 --> 08:53.834
So, how was Movie Brat?
Did she chew you up and spit you out?

08:53.917 --> 08:56.792
Please.
Piece of cake.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.000
Oh, really?
Well, let's have a looky-loo.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.208
My nana always says that.
I love my nana.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.875
So, the Joe charm actually worked, huh?

09:03.959 --> 09:05.959
Told ya, putty.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.375
Oh, wow, OK, she really loves you.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.750
-I know.
-No, no, no. I mean, she loves you.

09:10.834 --> 09:14.667
-As in the two of you are in love.
-Whoa, what?

09:14.750 --> 09:17.792
-Boyfriend?
-[Stella laughs]

09:17.875 --> 09:19.667
No, no, no, this isn't funny.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.834
Really?
'Cause I think it's "putty" hilarious.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.250
If I didn't say it,
it was just gonna say itself.

09:25.333 --> 09:29.000
Well, if I'm her "boyfriend," then I'll
just call her up and break up with her.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.333
Yeah, great idea, Joe.
And then with a few keystrokes,

09:31.417 --> 09:33.667
she can destroy <i>Forever April</i>
and your acting career.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.417
-Jessica wouldn't do that.
-Oh, right.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.917
'Cause telling the world you're a couple
after just meeting, totally normal.

oh, you have a new nickname.

-[sighs]
-Joey-poo.

09:51.542 --> 09:54.166
Stop it!
This is your fault.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.083
What?
How is this my fault?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.709
You're the one who said
not every girl would find this charming.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.959
-So?
-You got in my head!

10:01.041 --> 10:02.709
You made me over flirt.

10:02.792 --> 10:05.834
Oh, well, I'm sorry. As far as
I'm concerned, if you over flirt,

10:05.917 --> 10:08.750
-you totally deserve this.
-[cell phone beeping]

10:10.291 --> 10:12.333
Oh, no!
She wants to go out at 6:00.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.333
-What do I do?
-Well, you can't dump her.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.000
So, the way I see it,
you have to get her to dump you.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.792
-Come on, seriously?
-Oh, fine, you're on your own.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.208
Wait, wait, wait.
Just tell me what to do.

Oh, that's the right attitude...

Sorry.

10:45.583 --> 10:46.917
-Can we just--
-Shh!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.333
We're nearly there.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.458
And we're there.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.041
-How do you feel?
-Awesome.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.333
You're right, Mantra.

10:55.417 --> 10:58.834
Staring at each other silently
for an hour is very cleansing.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.417
-It's like a loofah for the mind.
-Totally.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.250
-So, when do we get to the music?
-Right.

Paint it for me.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.834
OK, I totally respect your process,
but how do you paint a song?

11:09.917 --> 11:11.458
[chuckles]
Nick.

11:12.583 --> 11:16.083
I remember when Jagger asked me
that very same question.

11:16.166 --> 11:19.333
-As did Timberlake.
-And what'd you tell them?

11:20.125 --> 11:23.625
Well, I think the chart-topping
number-one songs

11:23.709 --> 11:25.583
I recorded for them provided the answer.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.417
Got it.
Uh, do you have a smock?

11:29.500 --> 11:31.166
A smock?

11:33.083 --> 11:33.959
Never mind.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.834
Feeling good, make that great!
Ready to flip.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.917
Whoo!

11:42.000 --> 11:43.917
-Nice try.
-OK, I know I told you not to let me stop,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.583
-but I have got to stop.
-Keep rolling!

11:45.667 --> 11:47.667
-I have to go to the bathroom!
-I'll give you one minute.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.083
-But I have to roll back to the house.
-Fifty-five seconds.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.041
Oh, my God.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.500
[yelps]

11:54.750 --> 11:56.375
[groans]

11:58.875 --> 12:01.208
OK, Jessica's going
to be here any minute.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.083
-What's the plan?
-OK, Macy and I are going to watch

12:03.166 --> 12:04.875
everything that goes on from this table.

12:04.959 --> 12:07.375
-How is that going to help her dump me?
-It doesn't. We're just nosy.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.959
-Plus, they have killer garlic fries.
-Yeah.

12:10.041 --> 12:14.041
-Guys, come on, I need your help here.
-Joe, we're just messing with you.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.625
OK, so here's the plan:
you're gonna tell her that

12:16.709 --> 12:18.917
if you're going to be a couple,
she needs to know all of your flaws.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.834
-Every single one of them.
-[Macy] And when she hears them,

12:20.917 --> 12:23.542
she'll drop you like a hot tamale.
Oh, those are really good here, too.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.834
Perfect. So, I just have to
make up some flaws

12:25.917 --> 12:27.458
and then she'll break up with me.

12:29.375 --> 12:32.166
-Please tell me you're joking.
-No. Why?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.709
OK, let me help you out there, Joe.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.417
You're afraid of commitment.
You're a hopeless flirt.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.542
You can't make a decision
or express your feelings.

12:40.625 --> 12:44.041
And to top it all off,
you have an ego the size of Montana.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.083
Wow, you came up with those fast.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.041
-You forgot oblivious.
-That, too.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.250
-[phone chimes]
-The Brat is here.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.166
How do you know?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.834
Because her blog says
she's walking in right now.

12:57.458 --> 13:00.709
-Jessica.
-Joey-poo!

13:00.834 --> 13:03.375
Oh, wow.
All right, you can let go now.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.041
[Jessica]
Oh, no, thank you, honey.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.417
-OK, our table's right over there.
-OK.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.000
-Wow, you're very strong.
-[giggles]

13:18.625 --> 13:20.375
And sometimes I'm oblivious.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.709
Joe, I had no idea it was so tough
being a rock star's girlfriend.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.458
I know. I bet you're
reconsidering this whole thing.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.291
No, just the opposite.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.834
Your honesty has made me
feel closer to you.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.750
Wow! What a grip you got there.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.500
I know.
It's from all the texting.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.750
I can crack a Brazil nut
with my bare hand.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.083
-[mimics cracking]
-[chuckles]

13:41.166 --> 13:42.625
Don't you think this is
moving a little fast?

13:42.709 --> 13:45.875
Oh, no, Joe!
Last year, I was a dork with braces

13:45.959 --> 13:49.750
blogging from my bedroom
and look at me now! [cackles]

13:49.834 --> 13:55.667
I'm fabulous! I can make or break careers.
My boyfriend is a rock star!

13:55.750 --> 13:57.959
[groans]
Wow.

13:58.041 --> 14:00.000
Will you excuse me?
Lots of iced tea.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.750
Tiny tank, another strike against Joe.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.792
"Tiny tank."
Hmm.

14:07.834 --> 14:10.083
[girls laughing]

14:12.041 --> 14:14.792
-Hey there, tiny tank.
-She blogged that already?

14:14.875 --> 14:18.500
This is a disaster. None of those flaws
you made up are working.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.208
Joe, I didn't make those up.

14:20.959 --> 14:25.959
Wait... so... all of those things
you said about me you meant?

14:26.750 --> 14:28.375
Well...

14:29.125 --> 14:30.417
[Macy]
You'd better get back over there, buddy.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
Apparently, you're having Thanksgiving
at her parents' in El Segundo.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.750
This is the worst day ever.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.750
I think I really hurt his feelings.

14:41.834 --> 14:44.125
Well, luckily for you
he can't express them.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.792
No, seriously, Mace,
have I been crazy mean to him today?

14:46.875 --> 14:48.333
He kind of deserved it at first,

14:48.458 --> 14:51.667
but you really went to town
with him on that one.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.834
-How do we get him out of this?
-Well, there's one way,

14:57.917 --> 14:59.333
but you're not gonna like it.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.750
[Kevin grunting]

15:03.166 --> 15:04.709
-Pull!
-Oh, come on.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.709
[grunts]

15:05.792 --> 15:07.166
-Faster!
-I can do it.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.959
-Giddy up, Rudolph.
-Ahhh! There we go!

15:11.041 --> 15:12.792
-Yes, yes!
-Keep going! Go!

15:12.875 --> 15:15.875
Mush, mush, mush, mush.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.917
So, anyway, I was thinking that we could
do Thanksgiving with my mom

15:19.000 --> 15:21.959
and Christmas with my dad
and New Year's with your family.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.291
Are you OK, Joey-poo-poo-poo?

15:27.375 --> 15:30.250
Yeah, just something somebody
said to me earlier.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.083
-I'm thinking about it.
-You're so deep.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.667
-I love guys who think.
-Joe.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.667
-There you are.
-Uhh...

15:37.750 --> 15:40.083
-Am I supposed to know who you are?
-Play along.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.792
Stella, hey!

15:41.875 --> 15:44.417
-This is Jessica. This is Stella.
-Hi.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.291
Movie Brat, I know.
I follow your blog,

15:46.375 --> 15:50.834
and I saw that you and Joe
are kind of together.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.500
"Kind of together?"

15:54.041 --> 15:57.000
Try "soulmates forever."
[coos]

15:57.083 --> 15:58.917
-Yeah.
-[giggles]

16:01.959 --> 16:03.542
Well, Jessica...

16:03.667 --> 16:07.792
Ms. Brat, the thing is you just met Joe.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.959
And... I've known him my whole life.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.000
And the truth is, Joe...

16:20.333 --> 16:21.792
I love you.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.375
Joe, do you feel the same way?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.625
-I totally do.
-[Jessica scoffs]

16:35.667 --> 16:36.875
Unbelievable.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.041
Are you mad?

16:39.959 --> 16:43.000
No, Joe!
[laughs]

16:43.083 --> 16:46.083
And... lady person.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.875
My blog brought the two of you together.

16:49.959 --> 16:52.208
I am that powerful.

16:52.333 --> 16:56.000
[exhales]
Joe, I am really gonna miss you.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.000
-I mean, what we had--
-[phone chimes]

16:59.709 --> 17:04.125
Whoa!
Zac Efron is giving me an exclusive!

17:04.959 --> 17:06.750
I gotta run. Lates.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.542
-So?
-So.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.250
-Hey, so it worked?
-Yeah, it totally worked. She bought it.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.625
-[Macy squeals]
-Wait, that whole thing was an act?

17:17.709 --> 17:21.291
-My idea. Can I get a woot-woot?
-Woot-woot.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.917
So, real flaws, fake love, got it.

17:28.792 --> 17:32.291
-I gotta go.
-Oh, Joe, no, stay.

17:32.375 --> 17:34.542
I mean, let's celebrate.
You're a free man.

17:34.625 --> 17:35.709
Mm-hmm.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.834
I'll see you guys at home.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.166
Dude!
What's with tiny tank?

17:46.041 --> 17:47.625
What's with you?

17:48.125 --> 17:51.041
You want to know the weirdest part
about pretending to like Joe again?

17:51.125 --> 17:54.333
-What?
-I kinda started to like Joe again.

17:55.959 --> 17:59.458
[laughing]
You almost got me.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.208
You're not acting right now, are you?

18:07.458 --> 18:08.709

-No, the one you just painted.

-Yeah, purple.

19:43.041 --> 19:46.250
Now, a final question, young Nick,

19:46.333 --> 19:48.917
tell me, if I was to eat
your song for dinner--

19:49.000 --> 19:51.583
OK, Mantra, I would really
like to work with you,

19:51.667 --> 19:53.250
but we're just not on
the same wavelength here.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.250
Whoa, claws in, kittycat.

19:56.333 --> 19:59.834
I know you don't see it,
but there's a method to my madness.

19:59.917 --> 20:05.125
Plus, I need a new painting
for my bathroom.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.542
So, are you saying you want
to work together?

20:06.625 --> 20:10.417
-I am. And I am.
-Awesome, I'll call the guys.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.959
Oh, no, no, Nick, I'm not interested
in working with your brothers, just you.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.875
-What?
-There's something inside of you,

20:17.959 --> 20:21.125
a solo voice that needs to be heard.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.166
But we've always been a band.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.625
Always only goes up till now.

20:28.166 --> 20:32.375
It's time to go it alone, Nick.
Are you ready?

20:46.709 --> 20:48.375
Hey, bro, how's your day going?

20:48.625 --> 20:52.083
Well, I had lunch,
got a crazy girlfriend,

20:52.166 --> 20:53.875
made holiday plans, broke up with her.

20:53.959 --> 20:57.208
Oh, and I just found out how Stella
really feels about me. Good times.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.125
Sorry, bro.
Are you doing all right?

20:59.208 --> 21:00.583
Well, I would talk about it,
but apparently,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.625
I'm bad at expressing my feelings.

21:03.583 --> 21:04.959
How was your day with Mantra?

21:05.041 --> 21:06.917
Oh, you know. I just did some painting,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.542
stared, played the flute;
same old, same old.

21:10.125 --> 21:12.291

Just took a hot bath.

-Funny.

something good happened today.

and I know this can't be true,

21:36.041 --> 21:37.458
but the fans are going crazy.

21:37.542 --> 21:39.375
She posted something about you.

21:39.458 --> 21:42.750
Me?
What'd she say?

According to Movie Brat,
you're going solo.
