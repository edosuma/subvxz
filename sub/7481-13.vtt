<i>What's Addie worried about?</i>

00:07.660 --> 00:09.493
The most I'll miss
is the first quarter.

00:09.495 --> 00:10.777
I promise.

00:12.164 --> 00:13.330
All right, I got to go.

00:13.332 --> 00:14.548
I love you.

00:21.974 --> 00:24.041
Pull your vehicle over.

00:34.802 --> 00:35.986
Just play it cool.

00:40.909 --> 00:42.526
Is there a problem?

00:42.528 --> 00:43.911
Other than making
your commute

00:43.913 --> 00:45.362
louder than the
Soul Train Awards?

00:45.364 --> 00:46.980
License and
registration.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.601
We don't want
any trouble, Officer.

00:50.603 --> 00:52.002
I'm helping

00:52.004 --> 00:53.337
my friend move.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.507
What do you say

00:56.509 --> 00:58.491
we take a look at
what you're moving?

01:26.539 --> 01:27.905

♪

02:03.908 --> 02:06.126
What is that?

02:06.128 --> 02:08.509
That appears
to be a fish tank.

02:08.511 --> 02:09.378
Why is it here?

02:09.380 --> 02:13.433
That is an excellent question,
to which I have an answer.

02:13.435 --> 02:14.416
This should be good.

02:14.418 --> 02:15.635
Had a date
this weekend.

02:15.637 --> 02:17.186
Went to the carnival, won

02:17.188 --> 02:18.304
that goldfish.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.089
Obviously wasn't a
game of strength.

02:20.091 --> 02:21.641
Or wits.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.359
That's very clever.
Moving on.

02:23.361 --> 02:24.694
I didn't even want the goldfish,
but my date insisted

02:24.696 --> 02:26.262
I give it a proper home,
which meant

02:26.264 --> 02:28.448
something nicer than
the plastic bag that it came in.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.483
So, went to the pet store,

02:30.485 --> 02:32.034
bought this aquarium,
but then we started

02:32.036 --> 02:33.786
looking at it,
realized how lonely it looked,

02:33.788 --> 02:35.104
which meant, of course...

02:35.106 --> 02:36.873
More fish.
Exactly.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.741
But there's so many fish
to choose from, I didn't know

02:38.743 --> 02:41.410
where to start, which is
where I had my epiphany.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.296
You ready for this?

02:43.298 --> 02:45.047
Doppelganger aquarium.

02:45.049 --> 02:46.249
Doppelganger?

02:46.251 --> 02:47.449
Each one of us

02:47.451 --> 02:49.285
has a counterpart in there.

02:49.287 --> 02:50.286
Sam, check it.

02:50.288 --> 02:51.387
Right there,

02:51.389 --> 02:53.473
armoured catfish--
that's you.

02:53.475 --> 02:55.558
That's a tough fish;
doesn't take crap

02:55.560 --> 02:56.759
from any other fish.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.794
Kensilina, angelfish.

02:58.796 --> 02:59.762
Look how it glides

02:59.764 --> 03:01.347
all sexy through the water.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.965
I like my fish.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.517
Eh, your fish likes my fish.

03:04.519 --> 03:06.435
Those are the gourami
kissing fish.

03:06.437 --> 03:07.687
That's Eric and Nell.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.939
And, Callen,
this is you.

03:09.941 --> 03:11.974
Black ghost knifefish.
It's sleek,

03:11.976 --> 03:14.160
sharp, mysterious, solitary.

03:14.162 --> 03:15.194
Hides in plain sight.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.913
Where's Hetty?
Hetty?

03:16.915 --> 03:18.331
Yeah, I'm actually
working on Hetty,

03:18.333 --> 03:19.665
'cause there's a problem.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.984
Small fish tend to be eaten
by the bigger ones, so...

03:21.986 --> 03:23.419
And you're the goldfish,
I take it?

03:23.421 --> 03:25.821
Of course I'm the
goldfish-- it's gold.

03:25.823 --> 03:28.257
It's valuable,
desirable, beautiful.

03:28.259 --> 03:29.792
King of the aquarium.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.711
There's something wrong
with the king's eyeball.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.950
Wait, what are you
talking about?

03:33.952 --> 03:35.238
You're right.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.323
It's, like, droopy and puffy.

03:37.325 --> 03:38.691
Yeah, I had a buddy
that had one like this.

03:38.693 --> 03:40.193
They had to remove it
from the tank

03:40.195 --> 03:41.494
before it infected
all the other fish.

03:41.496 --> 03:44.363
Died all by himself
a little while later.

03:44.365 --> 03:45.364
Oh.
No, no.

03:45.366 --> 03:47.250
Goldfish Deeks, no.

03:50.037 --> 03:52.154
This footage was taken

03:52.156 --> 03:54.373
from Sergeant Rick Gibson's
patrol car camera.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.926
He stopped this rental van
on a noise violation.

03:56.928 --> 03:58.411
According to
the officer's report,

03:58.413 --> 04:01.430
he asked the driver to show him
what was in the cargo area.

04:01.432 --> 04:03.499
That's when he was shot
by the passenger.

04:03.501 --> 04:05.051
Unfortunately,
the camera didn't capture

04:05.053 --> 04:06.669
an image of
the passenger's face.

04:06.671 --> 04:08.187
The officer was able

04:08.189 --> 04:09.639
to get off two rounds

04:09.641 --> 04:11.140
that shot the driver
in the back.

04:11.142 --> 04:12.675
He was dead
at the scene.

04:12.677 --> 04:14.360
It was, however,
a Kodak moment

04:14.362 --> 04:16.978
for Karim Moussa,
a Chechen-American

04:16.981 --> 04:18.648
with ties to
the Haqqani network.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.848
It's a terrorist
group with links

04:19.850 --> 04:21.033
to al-Qaeda and
the Taliban,

04:21.035 --> 04:23.052
who use foreign fighters
to help with their cause.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.820
After years of
oppression by Moscow,

04:24.822 --> 04:27.523
Chechnya has become a hotbed
of Islamic terrorism.

04:27.525 --> 04:29.976
Haqqani is obviously
taking advantage of this,

04:29.978 --> 04:33.713
drawing Chechen-Americans
to help with the cause.

04:33.715 --> 04:35.715
As much as we say
that law enforcement

04:35.717 --> 04:37.700
doesn't use racial profiling,
if you've got olive skin

04:37.702 --> 04:39.752
and a Muslim surname,
it does grab more attention.

04:39.754 --> 04:41.203
And most
Chechen extremists

04:41.205 --> 04:43.089
don't look Middle Eastern.

04:43.091 --> 04:44.373
He shot a cop in broad daylight.

04:44.375 --> 04:45.725
He was protecting something
or someone

04:45.727 --> 04:47.376
in the back of that van.

04:47.378 --> 04:49.211
Thanks to his vest,
Gibson survived the shooting.

04:49.213 --> 04:51.180
He's in the hospital,
conscious and stable.

04:51.182 --> 04:53.816
All right, Sam and I
will see what he can give us.

04:53.818 --> 04:55.434
Kensi, Deeks, why don't you
see what you can

04:55.436 --> 04:56.736
get from
the rental company.

04:56.738 --> 04:59.272
Sure.

05:03.443 --> 05:05.361
Hello there.

05:05.363 --> 05:07.896
We need information on
whoever rented this van.

05:07.898 --> 05:10.566
No problem.

05:15.238 --> 05:17.906
A Mr. McGrady--
Dennis McGrady.

05:17.908 --> 05:20.092
Oh, that's a nice,
traditional Chechen name.

05:24.348 --> 05:27.082
The rental agreement.

05:27.084 --> 05:31.103
A copy of his driver's license
and credit card.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.924
Oh, the license is
obviously a counterfeit.

05:35.926 --> 05:37.693
Probably programmed
the magnetic strip

05:37.695 --> 05:40.479
off a stolen
credit card.

05:40.481 --> 05:44.367
They were very specific
about what they wanted:

05:44.369 --> 05:48.571
a cargo van with
the rear windows tinted dark.

05:48.573 --> 05:50.773
Was he with anyone?

05:50.775 --> 05:52.825
Um, an African-American
gentleman.

05:52.827 --> 05:54.910
Do you, uh, remember
what he looks like?

05:54.912 --> 05:58.464
No taller than six-two,
no shorter than six feet.

05:58.466 --> 06:01.133
Medium build,
fitted crimson T-shirt.

06:01.135 --> 06:03.002
Red T-shirt.

06:03.004 --> 06:05.054
Crimson.
Crimson?

06:05.056 --> 06:07.123
Mm-hmm.
He was wearing jeans.

06:08.124 --> 06:09.809
32 or 34 waist, boot cut,

06:09.811 --> 06:11.427
vintage wash, probably Gap.

06:11.429 --> 06:13.295
Could've been Old Navy.

06:13.297 --> 06:16.098
I think we'd like you to
speak to a sketch artist.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.468
Oh, I have no idea
what his face looks like.

06:21.438 --> 06:23.656
And I didn't get
a good look at the passenger.

06:23.658 --> 06:25.775
All right,
start at the beginning.

06:25.777 --> 06:28.160
They were blasting their music
pretty loud.

06:28.162 --> 06:29.578
When I pulled in behind,

06:29.580 --> 06:31.781
he started driving
like a church lady.

06:31.783 --> 06:33.449
Driver was all twitchy.

06:35.336 --> 06:37.486
You okay?

06:37.488 --> 06:39.121
Yeah.

06:39.123 --> 06:41.657
Used to think wearing that vest
was a pain in the ass.

06:41.659 --> 06:43.676
But my daughter kept nagging me
about it every morning.

06:43.678 --> 06:46.495
Now I wouldn't be
caught dead without it.

06:46.497 --> 06:48.547
What else do you remember?

06:48.549 --> 06:51.050
Russian,

06:51.052 --> 06:52.218
maybe Eastern European.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.469
The voice didn't fit

06:53.471 --> 06:54.837
the name
on the license.

06:54.839 --> 06:56.505
You see anything unusual
in the cab?

06:56.507 --> 06:58.107
No. The van was pretty clean.

06:58.109 --> 07:00.476
The only thing I saw was
a takeout bag from a restaurant.

07:00.478 --> 07:02.010
The name of the restaurant
on it?

07:02.012 --> 07:03.729
Yeah, but I don't remember it.

07:03.731 --> 07:05.013
But the logo--

07:05.015 --> 07:06.348
it was a cartoon.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.517
It was a-a chicken
wearing checkered pants.

07:11.188 --> 07:13.706
So, the only
Mr. Fancy Pants Chicken

07:13.708 --> 07:16.542
in Los Angeles
is in the Valley.

07:16.544 --> 07:19.245
Got it.

07:19.247 --> 07:21.831
Fortunately, there are a number
of traffic cams in the area.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.149
Nice.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.134
So...

07:25.136 --> 07:27.136
our fish.

07:27.138 --> 07:28.671
What do you think?

07:28.673 --> 07:32.875
I mean, you know that
they're, uh, kissing fish?

07:32.877 --> 07:36.378
Yeah, I, um...
I actually did some research.

07:37.213 --> 07:39.348
You did?
Mm-hmm.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.350
You know when they are locking
their lips together

07:41.352 --> 07:42.768
and it looks like
they're kissing?

07:42.770 --> 07:44.236
Yeah.

07:44.238 --> 07:45.654
They're not.

07:45.656 --> 07:47.723
They're actually
fighting.

07:47.725 --> 07:50.076
Fighting?
Yeah.

07:50.078 --> 07:53.896
It's their way of,
uh, showing dominance.

07:56.032 --> 07:58.901
That's... cool.
Yeah.

07:58.903 --> 08:01.537
I thought so.

08:01.539 --> 08:03.071
Ooh.

08:03.073 --> 08:05.257
I have the, uh, rental van

08:05.259 --> 08:07.626
on traffic cam footage
from yesterday

08:07.628 --> 08:09.845
an hour after
the shooting,

08:09.847 --> 08:12.381
turning east on
Saticoy, 1400 block.

08:12.383 --> 08:16.268
That's about half a mile
from the restaurant.

08:16.270 --> 08:18.304
Checking the first Saticoy cam

08:18.306 --> 08:21.056
and one on another street
due west.

08:21.058 --> 08:22.942
If the van came out,
it would have had

08:22.944 --> 08:24.443
to pass by one of them.

08:25.846 --> 08:28.097
Which it did not.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.299
I'm calling Callen.

08:33.352 --> 08:34.736
There.

08:34.739 --> 08:36.539
The van's in
a parking lot.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.791
Copy that. We see it, too.

08:47.634 --> 08:50.002
Clear.

08:54.808 --> 08:56.308
Go.

08:58.011 --> 08:59.595
Clear!

09:08.071 --> 09:10.322
What is that?

09:11.608 --> 09:13.325
It's ammonium nitrate.

09:13.327 --> 09:14.326
Fertilizer used

09:14.328 --> 09:15.794
to make explosives.

09:15.796 --> 09:18.664
Explosives used
to kill 170 people

09:18.666 --> 09:20.749
in the Oklahoma City bombing.

09:20.751 --> 09:22.317
A Chechen extremist

09:22.319 --> 09:24.503
was hauling it around town.

09:36.781 --> 09:39.532
LAPD Crime Lab didn't get
a lot on the van

09:39.534 --> 09:40.784
beyond confirming
what Sam suspected.

09:40.786 --> 09:42.402
Traces of
ammonium nitrate.

09:42.404 --> 09:44.103
Right, but there
was something left

09:44.105 --> 09:46.373
in the tire treads:
cellulose fiber.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.292
It's basically a pulp
made from recycled paper.

09:49.294 --> 09:52.462
Now, there are three recycling
mills in Los Angeles,

09:52.464 --> 09:54.464
all of which are in
the downtown area.

09:54.466 --> 09:56.716
Two are still active,
but the third...

09:56.718 --> 09:58.802
went out of business
over a year ago

09:58.804 --> 10:00.787
due to the downturn
in the economy.

10:00.789 --> 10:02.389
The owner,
Akmed Movladiev,

10:02.391 --> 10:03.956
is a Chechen
national

10:03.958 --> 10:05.975
who repatriated
back to Chechnya

10:05.977 --> 10:07.310
when his business went belly-up.

10:07.312 --> 10:09.128
"Belly-up."

10:09.130 --> 10:10.146
That reminds me, Mr. Deeks.

10:10.148 --> 10:11.347
Hmm?

10:11.349 --> 10:14.350
Condolences on
your impending loss.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.469
My fish is fine.

10:16.471 --> 10:17.921
I think.

10:17.923 --> 10:20.273
From what
we can gather,

10:20.275 --> 10:22.609
Mr. Movladiev retained
several close relationships

10:22.611 --> 10:24.027
in his motherland,

10:24.029 --> 10:25.945
including some
with suspected ties

10:25.947 --> 10:27.280
to the Haqqani network.

10:27.282 --> 10:28.782
And from the looks

10:28.784 --> 10:31.818
of this satellite image,
someone's keeping the lights on.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.204
Satellite images from
yesterday show the rental van

10:34.206 --> 10:37.040
entering the facility
and leaving a short time later.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.008
Probably to off-load
the ammonium nitrate.

10:39.010 --> 10:41.377
Then they ditched the van,
'cause if the police link it

10:41.379 --> 10:43.630
to the cop shooting,
the whole operation is blown.

10:43.632 --> 10:45.832
Should we go in
and bust it up?

10:45.834 --> 10:47.100
Not yet.

10:47.102 --> 10:50.353
Most cells
are compartmentalized.

10:50.355 --> 10:51.938
If we illuminate

10:51.940 --> 10:54.691
their operation too soon,
it could trigger events

10:54.693 --> 10:56.776
by other conspirators.

10:56.778 --> 10:58.378
So, what's going down
in Los Angeles that might

10:58.380 --> 10:59.746
be a target
for a terrorist jihad?

10:59.748 --> 11:01.815
The Israeli Prime Minister
is visiting

11:01.817 --> 11:03.516
the Museum of Tolerance
this week.

11:03.518 --> 11:05.452
Author Ephraim Nabeel

11:05.454 --> 11:08.037
will be at Braddock University
to lecture on his book

11:08.039 --> 11:10.623
<i>Infidel:</i>
<i>Tales of a Reformed Muslim.</i>

11:10.625 --> 11:12.525
And former Secretary of State

11:12.527 --> 11:16.045
George Schultz is speaking
at the Reagan Library.

11:17.665 --> 11:19.382
What are you
thinking, Hetty?

11:19.384 --> 11:20.800
I'm thinking

11:20.802 --> 11:23.202
a good old-fashioned
stakeout is in order.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.255
See what shakes out.

11:25.257 --> 11:26.890
The old shake-out
stakeout?

11:27.558 --> 11:29.259
I like it.

11:39.687 --> 11:42.822
Anything from the kissing fish
side of the tank?

11:44.375 --> 11:46.392
Not getting any
Internet or cell signals

11:46.394 --> 11:47.994
from inside the
building at all.

11:47.996 --> 11:49.662
Even if the phones
were turned off,

11:49.664 --> 11:51.230
we should be able
to get something.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.082
Means they're not
using their cell phones,

11:53.084 --> 11:54.751
which is highly unlikely,

11:54.753 --> 11:56.769
or it means
they've removed the batteries.

11:56.771 --> 11:58.788
They're definitely savvy.

11:58.790 --> 12:00.456
Using a minimum
of technology

12:00.458 --> 12:03.193
so they won't be traced.
Smart.

12:03.195 --> 12:05.378
<i>I've been doing</i>
<i>a lot of thinking</i>

12:05.380 --> 12:07.931
about my fish.

12:07.933 --> 12:10.517
Yeah? You thinking, like,
burial or cremation,

12:10.519 --> 12:12.552
or just plain old
flush down the toilet?

12:12.554 --> 12:15.188
It's a goldfish, and I just...
I don't think it's me.

12:15.190 --> 12:17.423
You know what I mean?
It's just, it's too common.

12:17.425 --> 12:19.392
I need a fish that truly
represents my essence.

12:19.394 --> 12:21.761
What about a
canned sardine?

12:21.763 --> 12:24.397
Smelly, oily, cheap.

12:24.399 --> 12:27.901
See, you say things like that,
and I know you don't mean them.

12:27.903 --> 12:29.118
You're like the girl
in elementary school

12:29.120 --> 12:30.937
that hits you in the arm
because she really likes you.

12:30.939 --> 12:33.823
Oh. You know,
you're right.

12:36.611 --> 12:37.911
Ow.

12:37.913 --> 12:39.245
Hang on a second.

12:39.247 --> 12:41.447
We've got some action.

12:50.007 --> 12:52.508
Kens, Deeks, coming your way.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.683
We're on him.

13:00.685 --> 13:02.301
Copy. We're holding
our position.

13:20.005 --> 13:22.338
Eric, he just put a battery
in his cell.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.540
I see him, but he's bunched up.

13:24.542 --> 13:28.127
He's got to be separated
for me to lock in on him.

13:31.765 --> 13:33.516
Damn.

13:33.518 --> 13:34.851
Lose the signal?

13:34.853 --> 13:36.168
Negative. I still have too many.

13:36.170 --> 13:37.770
He's in a crowd.
It's impossible

13:37.772 --> 13:39.472
for me to isolate him.

13:39.474 --> 13:40.974
One of you needs
to get next to him.

13:40.976 --> 13:42.341
Stop him for a second.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.326
Copy that.

13:43.328 --> 13:44.694
Kens, do the bump.

13:44.696 --> 13:46.479
On it.

13:55.656 --> 13:57.173
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

13:57.175 --> 13:59.158
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.410
I'm sorry.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.978
You should be more careful.
Okay.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.080
Ah, still too
bunched up.

14:04.082 --> 14:06.332
Kensi, you got
to stop him longer.

14:06.334 --> 14:08.468
Actually, you know what?
I'm lost.

14:08.470 --> 14:12.288
I'm looking for a fish store
for my idiot boyfriend because

14:12.290 --> 14:14.373
he is obsessed with fish;
I don't know why.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.976
Um, but it's on
West Third Street,

14:16.978 --> 14:18.811
but we're on
Los Angeles Street.

14:18.813 --> 14:19.979
Got him.

14:19.981 --> 14:22.214
Point me
in the right direction?

14:22.216 --> 14:24.400
No. Sorry.

14:26.053 --> 14:27.603
Jamal Avlurov.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.388
He's 36 years old.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.108
A Chechen National with a degree
in chemical engineering

14:32.110 --> 14:33.776
from Moscow
State University.

14:33.778 --> 14:36.279
He's here
on a work visa for a Russian

14:36.281 --> 14:38.898
agricultural
consortium.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.734
Once we I.D.'d his cell number,
I sent a virus to the phone,

14:41.736 --> 14:43.386
which forwarded
cloned copies of

14:43.388 --> 14:45.304
the most recent calls, texts
and e-mails back to us.

14:45.306 --> 14:47.674
There was e e-mail

14:47.676 --> 14:49.876
written in Chechen, sent
from a secure site in Grozny.

14:49.878 --> 14:51.260
It had a sequence

14:51.262 --> 14:54.080
of alphanumeric codes
hidden within it.

14:54.082 --> 14:58.301
And when, uh, Nell and I put our
awesome code-breaking lips...

14:58.303 --> 15:00.603
heads together...

15:00.605 --> 15:03.272
It was like shooting fish
in a barrel.

15:03.274 --> 15:04.974
Really?

15:04.976 --> 15:07.810
It mentions a
Euroexpress Airways flight

15:07.812 --> 15:10.146
arriving at LAX from London
tomorrow morning.

15:10.148 --> 15:11.864
As well as

15:11.866 --> 15:14.817
a physical description of a man
wearing a red baseball cap.

15:14.819 --> 15:16.803
And there are
three Chechen passengers

15:16.805 --> 15:18.688
on that flight.
The one that

15:18.690 --> 15:21.574
best matches the description
in the e-mail is this one:

15:21.576 --> 15:23.543
Anwar Amurov.

15:23.545 --> 15:24.961
He was born in the U.S.,

15:24.963 --> 15:27.163
but moved back with his family
when he was ten years old.

15:27.165 --> 15:29.332
No record, no Homeland file.

15:29.334 --> 15:30.750
On nobody's radar.

15:30.752 --> 15:32.135
How tall is he?

15:32.137 --> 15:33.669
Just under
six feet.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.287
That'll work.

15:35.289 --> 15:39.142
Work for what exactly,
Mr. Callen?

15:39.144 --> 15:41.527
The red baseball cap.

15:41.529 --> 15:43.629
That's how the driver's
supposed to recognize him.

15:43.631 --> 15:45.098
They sent his description
in the e-mail

15:45.100 --> 15:46.632
'cause they've never
met before.

15:46.634 --> 15:48.050
And if they've never
met before...

15:48.052 --> 15:51.971
They'll be none the wiser
when I show up in his place.

16:06.928 --> 16:09.763
This is a dangerous game,
Mr. Callen.

16:09.765 --> 16:11.232
Isn't it always, Hetty?

16:11.234 --> 16:14.184
They've never
even met this guy.

16:14.186 --> 16:15.436
Well, that's a supposition

16:15.438 --> 16:16.520
It's an informed
supposition.

16:16.522 --> 16:18.005
Look, they're
expecting a guy

16:18.007 --> 16:19.890
in a red hat, five-eleven,
short hair,

16:19.892 --> 16:21.942
who speaks Russian,
and they're gonna get one.

16:21.944 --> 16:25.012
It's called risk assessment.

16:25.014 --> 16:27.281
When the odds are

16:27.283 --> 16:30.017
in favor of an agent getting
killed before he can procure...

16:30.019 --> 16:32.453
This unit goes in anyway.

16:32.455 --> 16:33.737
Look, I appreciate

16:33.739 --> 16:35.022
your protective
instincts, Hetty, but...

16:35.024 --> 16:36.657
I'm not mothering you,
Mr. Callen.

16:36.659 --> 16:38.375
Mr. Amurov is Chechen.

16:38.377 --> 16:41.662
And I'm familiar with most
common Chechen dialects.

16:43.498 --> 16:45.198
You know, we should just move in

16:45.200 --> 16:47.885
and take down this cell
right now.

16:47.887 --> 16:50.454
What about the unseen
contributors you mentioned?

16:50.456 --> 16:54.008
Can you guarantee
this is the only cell?

16:54.010 --> 16:55.676
Of course I can't.

16:55.678 --> 16:58.562
These people are
ruthless, Hetty.

16:58.564 --> 17:01.065
You know what
they're capable of.

17:01.067 --> 17:04.718
Hundreds of innocent lives
could be at stake.

17:10.724 --> 17:13.193
That's Russian,

17:13.194 --> 17:15.695
not Chechen.

17:40.055 --> 17:41.188
Watch your tenses,

17:41.190 --> 17:43.390
Mr. Callen.

17:50.732 --> 17:54.768
All right, earwig and button cam
charged and ready to go.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.403
Okay.

17:58.957 --> 18:01.125
Here we go.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.250
If they're careful
enough to take

18:10.252 --> 18:12.252
the batteries out of
their cell phones...

18:13.454 --> 18:15.139
You're right--
we can't guarantee

18:15.141 --> 18:16.924
you won't be strip-searched.
You're going to need

18:16.926 --> 18:19.560
to figure out a way to get them
to me once I'm inside.

18:20.962 --> 18:22.563
Anything else on Amurov?

18:22.565 --> 18:24.248
Uh, he's
a primary school teacher.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.233
Uh, married...

18:26.235 --> 18:28.235
with a four-year-old
daughter named Anya.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.870
Doesn't seem
to possess any

18:29.872 --> 18:32.906
discernible skills that would
make him a jihad player.

18:32.908 --> 18:35.142
So, why is he here?

18:35.144 --> 18:38.078
Guess we'll find out
soon enough.

18:49.207 --> 18:51.425
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

18:51.427 --> 18:53.093
Thank you.

18:54.879 --> 18:56.597
Bye, now.

19:28.362 --> 19:30.363
We're a go.

19:49.651 --> 19:51.902
♪

20:01.562 --> 20:03.580
He's in there.

20:16.511 --> 20:18.212
English only from now on.

20:18.214 --> 20:21.215
Remember,
you are American.

20:22.467 --> 20:26.053
We are all Americans now,
like everybody else.

20:31.259 --> 20:32.976
Gloria.

20:32.978 --> 20:36.063
She handles
operations and support.

20:36.065 --> 20:38.065
Food, accommodations.

20:38.067 --> 20:42.402
My go-to girl
for whatever it is I need.

20:46.107 --> 20:47.541
Chovka.

20:47.543 --> 20:49.442
Charlie in public.

20:49.444 --> 20:51.495
He takes care of, uh,

20:51.497 --> 20:53.947
delicate matters.

20:53.949 --> 20:55.448
Sometimes unpleasant.

20:55.450 --> 20:58.252
Uh, you've met James.

20:58.254 --> 20:59.887
Masud.

20:59.889 --> 21:02.622
James is a slave name given
to me by my oppressors.

21:02.624 --> 21:04.641
James--

21:04.643 --> 21:06.894
I mean, Masud--

21:06.896 --> 21:09.897
has been with us
only a short time,

21:09.899 --> 21:11.849
but he has proved himself

21:11.851 --> 21:13.934
dedicated
to our cause.

21:13.936 --> 21:18.021
This jihad
is our priority, Anwar.

21:18.023 --> 21:20.824
Takes precedence
over everything.

21:24.145 --> 21:26.079
We cannot afford

21:26.081 --> 21:27.247
to take any risks.

21:45.333 --> 21:48.969
James-- I mean, uh, Masud--

21:48.971 --> 21:52.689
allowed himself
to become distracted.

21:52.691 --> 21:57.561
Focused on himself
rather than our cause.

21:57.563 --> 22:02.065
This... error in judgment
caused us difficulties,

22:02.067 --> 22:06.019
but he delivered you to us,

22:06.021 --> 22:08.322
so his job is done.

22:10.124 --> 22:12.859
And soon...

22:12.861 --> 22:15.629
yours will be as well.

22:16.414 --> 22:18.966
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

22:18.968 --> 22:22.202
<i>Wa-alaikum salaam.</i>

22:36.064 --> 22:38.249
Mr. Amurov.

22:45.007 --> 22:47.008
We know
about the cell.

22:47.010 --> 22:48.710
We know about
its location.

22:48.712 --> 22:52.413
We know about the ammonium
nitrate currently being used

22:52.415 --> 22:54.849
to create a weapon
of mass destruction.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.435
We also know that you are here
to participate in a jihad.

22:57.437 --> 23:00.521
You know so much...

23:00.523 --> 23:03.758
yet understand so little.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.942
If you help us,

23:04.944 --> 23:07.645
it will be taken
into consideration

23:07.647 --> 23:08.946
during your trial.

23:08.948 --> 23:13.067
So I will get 40 to life
instead of 50.

23:13.069 --> 23:17.071
I don't know about that,
but if you cooperate,

23:17.073 --> 23:18.740
it might make the
difference in ever seeing

23:18.742 --> 23:20.274
your daughter
and wife again.

23:40.813 --> 23:43.264
So, tell me, Anwar,

23:43.266 --> 23:46.401
will Anya and
Katya understand?

23:53.192 --> 23:55.193
I will see them again.

23:55.195 --> 23:57.361
This I have no doubt.

23:59.948 --> 24:02.149
And when is that?

24:03.985 --> 24:06.337
In the afterlife.

24:06.339 --> 24:08.756
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

24:10.676 --> 24:13.211
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

24:18.434 --> 24:21.052
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

24:25.023 --> 24:28.693
<i>Salaam alaikum...</i>

24:44.743 --> 24:48.663
I'm glad to have
you here, Anwar.

24:48.665 --> 24:51.499
When our jihad
is put in play,

24:51.501 --> 24:53.334
the world will
take notice.

24:53.336 --> 24:54.919
When?

24:54.921 --> 24:56.254
Soon.

24:56.256 --> 24:57.839
When you learn

24:57.841 --> 25:00.725
how to target, you
will be very pleased.

25:00.727 --> 25:02.844
Because the whole world
will know?

25:02.846 --> 25:04.729
Like the Twin Towers?

25:04.731 --> 25:07.214
You ask a lot of
questions, Anwar.

25:07.216 --> 25:11.051
I travelled a great distance
to be part of this.

25:11.053 --> 25:14.889
Anna will be made very
proud of her father.

25:16.108 --> 25:17.942
Anya.

25:17.944 --> 25:20.060
Anya.

25:20.062 --> 25:23.063
Of course.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.833
You've had a long trip;
you must be hungry.

25:25.835 --> 25:29.120
The kitchen's
over there.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.589
Yes. Thank you.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.861
Don't screw this up, Fish Boy.

25:55.564 --> 25:58.316
Hey, man.
Got your pie.

25:58.318 --> 25:59.617
I didn't order a pizza.

25:59.619 --> 26:00.935
You didn't...? Uh...

26:00.937 --> 26:03.059
Is this 810 Commercial Avenue?
Yes.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.377
Well, then somebody
ordered a pizza.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.823
$18.50.

26:05.825 --> 26:06.958
You got the wrong address.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.826
No, no! Listen, listen,
man, I know this is

26:08.828 --> 26:10.444
a crappy job, but it's
the only one I got.

26:10.446 --> 26:12.213
All right?
And if I go back there

26:12.215 --> 26:13.948
with no money and cold
pizza, I'm gonna get fired.

26:13.950 --> 26:17.168
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to get a job right now?

26:17.170 --> 26:18.836
Not my problem.
Well, it's not my problem, either,

26:18.838 --> 26:21.255
so I'll just call my boss,
and then he can call the cops,

26:21.257 --> 26:23.474
and they can figure it out,
'cause I am not gonna get...

26:23.476 --> 26:25.509
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

26:25.511 --> 26:26.844
Yeah?

26:26.846 --> 26:28.796
Enjoy your pie.

26:42.978 --> 26:45.112
You're going to
throw away a pizza?

26:45.114 --> 26:46.647
Yes.

26:46.649 --> 26:48.616
Do you know how much
I have dreamed

26:48.618 --> 26:50.751
about American pizza
since I left?

26:51.587 --> 26:52.987
It's all yours.

26:52.989 --> 26:54.705
Thanks.

26:54.707 --> 26:55.923
Sure.

27:03.715 --> 27:05.132
Please...

27:05.134 --> 27:07.301
join me.

27:09.855 --> 27:12.640
I know I shouldn't,
Jamal, but...

27:12.642 --> 27:14.525
maybe just this once?

27:14.527 --> 27:16.560
If you want
to put poison

27:16.562 --> 27:19.847
inside your body, it's not
me you have to answer to.

27:27.572 --> 27:29.490
<i>The Quran says,</i>

27:29.492 --> 27:33.711
"Whoever kills
a person unjustly,

27:33.713 --> 27:37.131
it is as though he has
killed all of mankind""

27:37.133 --> 27:40.501
Yeah. The key word...

27:40.503 --> 27:42.503
is "just."

27:42.505 --> 27:46.206
When you kill in the name
of jihad, you defile Islam.

27:47.676 --> 27:49.760
You quote Quran

27:49.762 --> 27:52.647
and talk of immoral acts,
when, like cowards,

27:52.649 --> 27:55.266
you drop bombs
from the sky in drones.

27:55.268 --> 27:57.234
Is it right...

27:57.236 --> 28:01.155
you bomb us with impunity,
and world gives your president

28:01.157 --> 28:02.990
a peace prize?

28:02.992 --> 28:07.028
Is it right your political
cartoonists make us out

28:07.030 --> 28:08.946
to be clowns, hmm?

28:08.948 --> 28:11.449
And dare to write
the name of the Prophet?

28:11.451 --> 28:15.002
Is it right your authors,
who besmirch the name

28:15.004 --> 28:16.921
of the Prophet--
peace be unto him--

28:16.923 --> 28:20.374
are allowed to spread their
filth in your universities?

28:20.376 --> 28:21.959
This is right?!

28:21.961 --> 28:24.712
I don't care much
about politics.

28:24.714 --> 28:26.931
What I do care
about is stopping

28:26.933 --> 28:29.300
the senseless killing
of people who probably

28:29.302 --> 28:31.886
have nothing to do with
making decisions about drones

28:31.888 --> 28:34.105
or who gets a
Nobel Peace Prize.

28:34.107 --> 28:37.308
I have had enough of this.

28:37.310 --> 28:40.478
I have a right to see a lawyer.

28:43.598 --> 28:45.766
Yes, you do.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.707
You know what?

28:52.709 --> 28:55.442
If the situation
was reversed...

28:55.444 --> 28:58.245
and I was in the custody
of jihadists,

28:58.247 --> 29:01.281
the only right
I would have...

29:01.283 --> 29:04.502
is to have my head severed.

29:04.504 --> 29:08.122
I suppose you
consider that just.

29:08.124 --> 29:09.924
No.

29:09.926 --> 29:11.425
But...

29:11.427 --> 29:14.962
it is a good start.

29:18.734 --> 29:21.819
I haven't had a slice
in a long time.

29:21.821 --> 29:25.573
You converted because of Jamal?

29:25.575 --> 29:27.074
No. No.

29:27.076 --> 29:30.327
Because of Malcolm.

29:30.329 --> 29:33.831
My father tried to get in
my <i>chones</i> when I was 14,

29:33.833 --> 29:36.150
so I ran away.

29:36.152 --> 29:38.169
I got so desperate,

29:38.171 --> 29:40.171
I went down to the track.

29:40.173 --> 29:42.289
I was ready to turn tricks.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.825
Did you go through with it?

29:45.660 --> 29:48.429
No. It rained that night.

29:48.431 --> 29:53.300
I ended up ducking into
my homegirl's house to stay dry.

29:53.302 --> 29:56.053
Malcolm X was playing on cable.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.472
He also ran
the streets,

29:58.474 --> 30:01.692
used drugs.

30:01.694 --> 30:06.063
But when he submitted to Allah,
he was washed clean.

30:07.816 --> 30:11.652
That's all I wanted,
to be washed clean.

30:11.654 --> 30:14.738
And even though
I'm not denying

30:14.740 --> 30:17.491
he was black, it was...

30:17.493 --> 30:20.661
it was like he was
speaking to me.

30:20.663 --> 30:22.696
The movie led you
straight to the mosque?

30:22.698 --> 30:24.198
It did.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.084
And I never looked back.

30:27.086 --> 30:31.172
I felt acceptance and real love.

30:32.974 --> 30:34.725
Jamal told us that...

30:34.727 --> 30:36.560
Gloria.

30:39.147 --> 30:41.816
I have to go.

30:47.656 --> 30:49.607
I was just...

30:49.609 --> 30:50.858
You know better than that.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.027
Huh? Huh?

30:53.029 --> 30:55.279
Yeah. I'm sorry.

30:55.281 --> 30:57.164
Go.

30:59.251 --> 31:01.401
Okay, camera's up.

31:05.707 --> 31:07.908
Anwar.

31:09.261 --> 31:11.578
I don't think
he got the earwig.

31:12.931 --> 31:14.265
It's not right
for a woman

31:14.267 --> 31:17.601
to be so close to a man
she's not betrothed to, hmm?

31:17.603 --> 31:19.436
You are right.

31:19.438 --> 31:21.088
I understand.

31:23.108 --> 31:24.725
Come with me, Anwar.

31:24.727 --> 31:27.478
I have something
I want to show you.

31:29.531 --> 31:31.265
Freeze that, Mr. Beale.

31:32.484 --> 31:34.451
Starting facial rec.

31:53.788 --> 31:56.123
I wish it was me.

31:56.125 --> 31:59.760
But someone has
to coordinate.

31:59.762 --> 32:02.462
You are lucky.

32:04.266 --> 32:06.200
I am.

32:07.919 --> 32:10.054
Soon the world will
know your face.

32:10.056 --> 32:12.106
You'll be a hero

32:12.108 --> 32:16.327
to all those who fight and
sacrifice for our cause.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.335
You will be loved.

32:37.182 --> 32:39.016
What's the pen
and paper for?

32:39.018 --> 32:41.318
His martyr letter.

32:41.320 --> 32:45.556
Of explanation
to his family.

32:45.558 --> 32:50.361
Anwar was brought here
to be the suicide bomber.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.867
Mr. Callen is The Chosen One.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.554
Chovka Zelimov--

33:16.556 --> 33:18.189
heavy hitter
from Grozny.

33:18.191 --> 33:19.524
And Gloria Segarra?

33:19.526 --> 33:21.693
She has a file,

33:21.695 --> 33:23.328
but it's all
LAPD-gang-crime related.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.863
Nothing from Homeland
or any connections

33:25.865 --> 33:27.949
to terror networks.

33:27.951 --> 33:29.667
Gloria...

33:29.669 --> 33:32.036
I know you sometimes
may have felt that your jobs

33:32.038 --> 33:34.205
were menial and not
of great importance,

33:34.207 --> 33:37.041
but the time has come

33:37.043 --> 33:39.844
where you must perform

33:39.846 --> 33:44.098
a very... special
task for us.

33:50.356 --> 33:52.857
Anything, Jamal.

33:55.894 --> 33:57.895
Anwar.

33:57.897 --> 34:00.281
Come with me.

34:05.537 --> 34:07.205
That's some kind of map.

34:07.207 --> 34:10.241
That's as clear
as I can get it.

34:12.745 --> 34:14.945
Why is Callen

34:14.947 --> 34:16.130
holding the cam on that?

34:16.132 --> 34:17.815
Let me pull
a frame-grab.

34:17.817 --> 34:19.634
Daily Bobcat.

34:19.636 --> 34:21.636
Braddock University's
student paper.

34:21.638 --> 34:23.454
The map must be

34:23.456 --> 34:24.554
the Braddock campus.

34:24.556 --> 34:28.125
The author, Ephraim Nabeel,
is their target.

34:28.127 --> 34:29.627
During the
interrogation,

34:29.629 --> 34:32.063
Amurov railed against
authors who insult Islam.

34:32.065 --> 34:33.898
Yeah, killing him
and a crowd of hundreds

34:33.900 --> 34:35.933
would be a huge coup
for al-Qaeda.

34:41.690 --> 34:42.940
It's time.

34:46.311 --> 34:49.246
Chovka will drive,

34:49.248 --> 34:53.618
you... will be
in the back.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.536
The vest is
blocking the button-cam.

34:56.288 --> 34:57.154
Mr. Hanna,

34:57.156 --> 34:58.706
one of our jihadists

34:58.708 --> 35:02.126
has just placed
an explosive vest on Mr. Callen.

35:02.128 --> 35:03.461
When the vest detonates,

35:03.463 --> 35:05.496
the ANFO ignites
the ammonium nitrate.

35:05.498 --> 35:07.265
We got to get Callen
out of there.

35:07.267 --> 35:09.517
Got it.
We're on our way.

35:09.519 --> 35:12.270
<i>Van's on the move.</i>

35:12.272 --> 35:13.388
Headed east.

35:13.390 --> 35:16.474
Copy that.

35:16.476 --> 35:17.942
Coming up on Santa Fe.

35:17.944 --> 35:19.277
Let them pass the intersection.

35:19.279 --> 35:21.446
We'll box them in.
I'll take the front.

35:23.399 --> 35:24.866
<i>Got it.</i>

35:53.913 --> 35:55.980
Federal agents!

36:04.239 --> 36:06.007
Sam.

36:08.327 --> 36:12.196
Callen's not in the van.
Neither is the bomb.

36:12.198 --> 36:15.500
Hold on. I just got a report
of a suicide on the 101 freeway.

36:15.502 --> 36:18.336
A woman got out of her car
and shot herself in the head.

36:18.338 --> 36:19.704
The police are

36:19.706 --> 36:22.406
identifying her
as Gloria Segarra.

36:30.215 --> 36:31.666
The 101 is the route

36:31.668 --> 36:33.551
LAPD is using
to escort Ephraim Nabeel

36:33.553 --> 36:34.852
to Braddock University.

36:34.854 --> 36:36.637
Why would she do that?

36:36.639 --> 36:38.523
Maybe she had a change of heart;
she wants to stop

36:38.525 --> 36:39.607
the whole thing
from going down.

36:39.609 --> 36:40.808
I don't think so.

36:40.810 --> 36:41.893
The freeway's shut down.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.145
She shot herself
just past the Santa Fe exit.

36:44.147 --> 36:46.948
That's where all 101 traffic
is now being diverted.

36:48.433 --> 36:50.601
That's the off-ramp.

36:51.987 --> 36:53.571
And that's
our warehouse.

36:53.573 --> 36:54.655
Anyone on
the freeway

36:54.657 --> 36:56.607
will have to drive
right in front of it.

36:56.609 --> 36:58.108
Including...

36:58.110 --> 37:00.244
Mr. Nabeel.

37:00.246 --> 37:02.279
Alert the LAPD

37:02.281 --> 37:03.915
immediately.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.651
Mr. Callen and the bomb

37:06.653 --> 37:09.987
never left the building.

37:11.974 --> 37:14.124
When did you know?

37:14.126 --> 37:17.495
You wrote your letter
with your right hand.

37:17.497 --> 37:20.681
I don't remember much about
Anwar when we were in school,

37:20.683 --> 37:24.352
except that... all
of us left-handers,

37:24.354 --> 37:28.856
were all sat together
on the last row.

37:28.858 --> 37:31.492
How is blowing up
an abandoned warehouse

37:31.494 --> 37:33.861
gonna make
a statement for you?

37:33.863 --> 37:37.748
By killing a heretic
as his motorcade passes.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.200
His police escort

37:39.202 --> 37:43.421
should announce his arrival
very nicely.

37:43.423 --> 37:45.840
The benefits
of independent jihad:

37:45.842 --> 37:48.426
the ability to adapt
very quickly.

37:48.428 --> 37:50.828
Your government sends
a federal agent,

37:50.830 --> 37:53.965
we improvise.

37:53.967 --> 37:57.668
And should we be
denied our prize,

37:57.670 --> 38:01.022
well, we improvise again.

38:05.444 --> 38:08.196
A federal agent...

38:08.198 --> 38:12.450
should make a very nice
consolation prize.

38:40.345 --> 38:41.762
Clear!

38:41.764 --> 38:43.514
- Clear!
- In here!

38:46.602 --> 38:48.653
Sam, the vest!

38:48.655 --> 38:50.571
It's just me.

38:50.573 --> 38:52.189
There's no one in here.

38:53.224 --> 38:55.493
It can't be activated.

38:55.495 --> 38:57.745
This is Jamal's cell phone.

38:57.747 --> 38:58.829
If a call would've been

38:58.831 --> 39:01.032
completed to
the cell on your vest...

39:03.168 --> 39:04.368
...then this would have...

39:04.370 --> 39:06.587
It's nice to see you, too.

39:06.589 --> 39:08.739
- How you doing? You okay?
- Yeah.

39:08.741 --> 39:11.208
I've been better.
Thank you.

39:11.210 --> 39:12.510
Stop!

39:12.512 --> 39:14.411
Don't move.

39:16.098 --> 39:19.350
Looks like you're on
some sort of scale.

39:22.187 --> 39:25.139
It's rigged.

39:25.141 --> 39:26.941
What are we talking?

39:27.809 --> 39:30.111
Sam?

39:39.454 --> 39:43.691
Looks like a pressure switch
wired to some high explosives.

39:43.693 --> 39:45.743
So if he steps
off the scale...

39:45.745 --> 39:48.079
He triggers the charge.

39:52.217 --> 39:53.384
Sam?

39:54.219 --> 39:55.836
Be still.

39:55.838 --> 39:58.556
Be very still, G.

39:58.558 --> 40:00.591
Okay.

40:23.865 --> 40:25.366
Good?

40:25.368 --> 40:27.251
Got it.

40:27.253 --> 40:29.036
We're good.

40:35.210 --> 40:37.428
Thank you.

40:50.175 --> 40:52.226
You ever see the
movie <i>Malcolm X?</i>

40:52.228 --> 40:54.562
Yeah.
It's an amazing film.

40:54.564 --> 40:56.480
His story is what inspired her.

40:57.649 --> 41:01.068
But then they twisted his
message into something that...

41:01.070 --> 41:04.238
made her life more hopeless
than it ever was.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.689
That's how
Islamic terrorists recruit.

41:05.691 --> 41:06.807
They find someone

41:06.809 --> 41:08.492
who's vulnerable...

41:08.494 --> 41:10.861
twist the promise
of the Quran, corrupt it

41:10.863 --> 41:12.963
to fit their needs.
Yeah, but in the end,

41:12.965 --> 41:14.582
Malcolm walked away
from extremism.

41:14.584 --> 41:17.134
Jamal pushed her towards it.

41:17.136 --> 41:19.003
Everyone has a choice, G.

41:19.005 --> 41:20.838
Gloria made the wrong one.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.890
It's not always that simple.

41:22.892 --> 41:25.176
Where's-where's

41:25.178 --> 41:27.178
my-my fish?
Don't look at me.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.345
I didn't touch it.

41:28.347 --> 41:29.764
Guys, there was
an aquarium,

41:29.766 --> 41:32.099
and it had
fish in it.

41:32.101 --> 41:33.734
What's, uh, going on?

41:33.736 --> 41:35.686
Uh, Deeks
can't find his fish.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.688
I can't find my fishies.

41:39.491 --> 41:41.909
What?

41:54.572 --> 41:57.758
So, this aquarium is
like a doppelganger tank.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.344
Each fish represents
one of our team.

42:00.346 --> 42:01.679
Yeah.

42:01.681 --> 42:03.147
Except for me,

42:03.149 --> 42:05.015
that is.

42:05.017 --> 42:06.083
I... Fair enough.

42:06.085 --> 42:07.584
I just haven't found
the right fish

42:07.586 --> 42:08.552
for you yet.

42:08.554 --> 42:11.522
No worries, Mr. Deeks.

42:11.524 --> 42:15.759
Because I took the liberty
of finding one of my own.

42:15.761 --> 42:17.478
A guppy?

42:17.480 --> 42:19.814
Wait-wait, Hetty, actually
there's a problem with

42:19.816 --> 42:21.565
the small fish,
'cause they tend to be eaten

42:21.567 --> 42:22.983
by the bigger ones. You couldn't...
Ah-ah-ah!

42:22.985 --> 42:24.434
You're gonna get
eaten by the...

42:40.657 --> 42:42.708
Why are you staring at me?

42:42.710 --> 42:44.993
Uh...

42:44.995 --> 42:46.429
Get back to work!

42:46.431 --> 42:48.381
All of you!

42:49.716 --> 42:51.434
Well done.

42:56.285 --> 42:59.489
You guys can swim,
but you can't hide.

42:59.589 --> 43:04.589
