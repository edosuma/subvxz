NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:06.006
I take it it's the gun
that shot Hill and Renko.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.883
-Yeah.
-I want a mini-documentary,

00:08.967 --> 00:12.887
an objective journalistic analysis
of what the station house is all about.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.265
No, really, Officer, my name is Dracula.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.683
(shouts)

00:16.766 --> 00:18.810
We've got a lead
on the Hill-Renko shooting,

00:18.893 --> 00:21.271
a good one that might not wait
on the judicial process.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.565
You're on dangerous ground, Furillo.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.984
Don't tell me to sit down.
That's the guy that shot me.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.361
(indistinct chattering)

00:28.445 --> 00:33.074
Item 9 concerns
our previously described male Caucasian

00:33.158 --> 00:35.702
biting various and sundry ladies
of the night...

00:35.785 --> 00:39.330
-MAN: Sounds like Belker.
-on Delaware Avenue in broad daylight

00:39.414 --> 00:42.459
in the general vicinity of the neck.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.170
(laughing)

00:45.253 --> 00:46.504
Item 10.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.215
Item 10.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.592
Your attention, please.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.801
(silence)

00:51.885 --> 00:54.554
We had a theft last night

00:54.637 --> 00:57.724
in the oligodactyly section of the zoo

00:57.807 --> 01:00.143
-of a Peruvian llama.
-(laughter)

01:00.226 --> 01:03.605
A Peruvian llama which answers
to the name Cookie,

01:03.688 --> 01:06.983
is approximately five feet tall,

01:07.067 --> 01:09.319
has curly blond hair,

01:09.402 --> 01:12.447
terminating in a thick, fluffy tail.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.782
MAN: Got her phone number?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.450
MAN 2: Sounds like Bates to me.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.618
(laughing)

01:16.701 --> 01:20.038
The last item is a directive
from divisional command to Swanson.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.372
Yes, sir.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.335
Concerning
the unusually high mortality rate

01:25.418 --> 01:28.129
of vending machines in this facility.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.422
(laughing)

01:29.506 --> 01:31.800
The most recent being

01:31.883 --> 01:34.427
the, uh, Busy Baker pastry machine

01:34.511 --> 01:35.762
sometime last night.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.305
(laughing)

01:37.388 --> 01:39.891
Anyone with information
regarding the assailant

01:39.974 --> 01:44.145
should report to me directly
subsequent to this roll call.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.939
All right, let's roll,

01:46.022 --> 01:47.899
and all of you,
let's be careful out there.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.068
(indistinct chattering)

02:01.454 --> 02:05.458
Now, I want to speak to you seriously
about hemorrhoidal discomfort.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.626
(laughing)

02:06.709 --> 02:09.254
Excuse me. I'm ethnic.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:11.840 --> 02:18.388
(scat singing)

02:18.471 --> 02:20.974
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:23.143
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

02:23.226 --> 02:27.063
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:28.648
(theme music playing)

03:34.380 --> 03:37.175
(lounge music playing)

03:53.149 --> 03:56.152
NEAL: Yeah, well, you know, you
didn't have to take her to a 3-star joint.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.571
Yeah, I know.
Who'd have figured a girl that size

03:58.655 --> 04:01.282
would order a 6-pound lobster
at 9 bucks a pound?

04:01.366 --> 04:04.202
-(chuckles)
-(sighs)

04:04.285 --> 04:05.995
-Hey, what do we got there?
-Oh, yeah.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.001
Uh-oh. Getting a negative from Roger.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.254
Looks like the dope deal
is off for today, babe.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.173
-No big thing.
-We've only been here two hours.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.428
Man, man, you talk about measuring
your life out in a teaspoon.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.184
The creep my sister married probably
already grossed 5 G's this morning.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
Hey, what say we go do our duty, J.D.?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.187
Hmm?

04:33.523 --> 04:36.442
Mm-mm. We don't do purse snatchers, man.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.695
We're big time, nothing but game fish.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.031
Oh, yeah? Well, name a couple
for me, man. I'm curious.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.701
Marlin, tuna, albacore, junkies...

04:44.784 --> 04:46.744
What's the matter, man?
Something eating you?

04:46.828 --> 04:47.870
Yeah, man.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.915
You, your brother-in-law, your sister,

04:50.999 --> 04:54.002
your basic negative cash flow, etc.,
I'm tired of hearing about it, man.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.712
Now just go bring the car around, okay?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.380
Wait a minute.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.716
Hey. Wait a minute.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.592
(horn honks)

05:02.927 --> 05:05.596
Hey, little sister. You know
you dropped your purse back there?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.889
I ain't your sister, sucker.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.392
Uh-oh. Go on, man, you try.
Ask her what's in the bag.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.602
Could you tell us
what you have in the bag?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.855
-Your ugly mama.
-There. You satisfied?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.232
Okay, sugar. Let's be a good little girl,

05:16.316 --> 05:17.692
show me what you got in the bag.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.402
Well, see for yourself, pig!

05:19.485 --> 05:21.029
I got her, Neal. I'll take her.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.405
Stop! Police officer!

05:22.488 --> 05:23.656
Halt!

05:29.203 --> 05:31.372
Mm-mm-mm.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.708
Well, what we got here?

05:33.791 --> 05:35.335
Oh.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.544
(panting)

05:37.587 --> 05:39.797
That's very flattering, Miss Chase,

05:39.881 --> 05:42.508
but I think you'd do better
concentrating on my men.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.178
They do the real work around here.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.472
That's not the way I hear it, Captain.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.474
Oh, not at all.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.683
On the contrary, what I--

05:50.767 --> 05:54.145
Whatever it is you're hearing,
I'm the administrator up here.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.855
If you base your report on me,

05:55.938 --> 05:59.859
you're going to end up with a 10-hour film
of a guy shuffling papers and phone calls

05:59.942 --> 06:02.195
with four trips to the coffeepot

06:03.029 --> 06:04.572
and two to the john.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.908
I'm afraid that wouldn't do
too much for your ratings.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.369
I've already got ratings, Captain.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.954
Look, I'm not trying to do
a piece of news fluff here.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.665
I want a mini-documentary,

06:14.749 --> 06:16.793
an objective journalistic analysis

06:16.876 --> 06:19.003
of what the station house is all about.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.047
FRANK: You want to do all that in one day?

06:21.130 --> 06:24.467
(sighs)
No, in as many days as it would take.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.593
FRANK: Well, good luck.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.763
I've been here over two years, and I still
haven't figured this place out.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.140
I share that observation, Francis.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.268
On line four, Detective Washington.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.270
Oh, thanks, Phil.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.899
Sergeant Esterhaus will be very happy
to show you around,

06:39.982 --> 06:41.234
if you'll excuse me.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.861
Cynthia Chase.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.696
Oh, how do you do, young lady?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.045
Yeah, Neal.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.755
NEAL: <i>Got a .357 magnum.</i>

07:02.839 --> 07:05.508
Picked it up off a petty thief
on 124th street.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.052
Yeah.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.389
She's a she, by the name of Billie Riles.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.225
Okay, run it by ballistics on the way in

07:14.308 --> 07:17.562
and be sure to remind them this might be
the gun from the Hill-Renko shooting.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.647
They're liable to think
we've closed the books.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.732
<i>And I want that gun tested today.</i>

07:21.816 --> 07:22.942
Yeah, okay, Cap.

07:23.025 --> 07:23.985
Good.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.531
(pen scratching)

07:31.701 --> 07:33.661
I'm truly sorry, Wilma. I really am.

07:33.744 --> 07:38.040
Whoa! Take it easy, Wilma. Come on now.
County's going to give you a tetanus shot.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.667
Like hell they will.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.502
Aside from messing up my complexion,

07:41.586 --> 07:43.296
I can't take the pain.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.132
What I need is one of those wooden stakes.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.592
Come off it, Wilma.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.303
There ain't no such thing as vampires.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.055
Oh, there are, Officer. She's right.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.600
Sit down, dirtball.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.853
You can call me Kevin, sir.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.398
Excuse me.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.569
Please pull yourself up a chair, Kevin.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.116
WOMAN: Could somebody take this man
down to fingerprinting?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.201
MAN: I got it.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.584
And here to your left
you'll find our booking and holding areas

08:21.667 --> 08:25.379
where your various basic
criminals are held

08:25.463 --> 08:27.590
pending their release or transfer

08:27.673 --> 08:29.759
to the Michigan Avenue complex.

08:31.427 --> 08:36.182
And, uh, oh, here is our water cooler,

08:36.265 --> 08:39.519
and even more importantly
our precinct coffee maker.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.730
Now, I prefer a fine grind
filter drip myself,

08:42.813 --> 08:46.359
but this one has
a 3-gallon-per-hour capacity,

08:46.442 --> 08:48.444
which makes a terrific place

08:48.528 --> 08:51.405
for the officers to inter-relate
their daily exploits

08:51.948 --> 08:55.284
and generally <i>interface,</i> as it were.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.203
Great news.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.041
Course I only went with him
to that hotel room

09:02.124 --> 09:05.127
because I thought he was
a serious professional photographer.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.464
Then, before I knew it, he was laying
those fangs of his upside my neck.

09:08.548 --> 09:13.886
"Fangs upside...

09:13.970 --> 09:17.181
of neck."

09:17.890 --> 09:18.975
Okay.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.478
All right, Kevin,
let's have your full name.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.439
You love her a lot, don't you?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.609
Debbie Kaplan, of course.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.952
Who told you that?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.121
No one, sir.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.041
It's written all over your ink blotter.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.013
All right, let's have it,
Kevin, your full name.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.767
K-E-V-I-N, Kevin.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.271
H-E-R-M-A-N, Herman.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.023
Mm-hmm.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.611
D-R-A-C-U-L-A, Dracula.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.993
I am trying to be nice
for a change, and you zing me.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.079
I don't react well to being zinged,

10:22.163 --> 10:24.206
not when I'm trying
to turn over a new leaf.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.209
No, really, Officer. My name is Dracula.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.463
See?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.300
I had it changed on my 18th birthday.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.600
Do you see that?

10:43.142 --> 10:46.937
If you're a vampire, how come
you got a reflection in the mirror?

10:48.814 --> 10:49.940
I don't see anything.

10:54.987 --> 10:58.658
WILMA: Police don't believe
no one unless they white.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.952
No matter nothing
if they freaks and junkies

11:02.036 --> 11:03.371
and neck-sucking vampires.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.207
Long as they white neck-sucking vampires.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.793
Judas Priest, man. Show a little life.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.878
You are a drugged, crazed psycho,

11:10.961 --> 11:14.048
and what's left of your mind
has been warped with PCP

11:14.131 --> 11:15.883
and you want to rip my lungs out.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.801
(growls)

11:16.884 --> 11:18.260
That's it. That's it now.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.513
Now come on. Cut me down.
Cut me down. Come on.

11:20.596 --> 11:25.142
That's it. Why, you.
Gotcha, you sorry-looking vermin.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.398
As you can see,
this is quite simple to operate.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.401
It does give you
fairly good control over your suspect

11:33.484 --> 11:36.320
whether you want him in your vehicle

11:36.404 --> 11:38.489
or if you want to move him out
of your vehicle

11:38.572 --> 11:40.866
or if you merely want him down
on his knees.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.497
And then, uh,
once you have him in holding,

11:46.580 --> 11:50.668
you simply press this side lever here,

11:51.252 --> 11:53.295
and that disengages the collar.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.590
Uh-oh.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.300
-MAN: Simply, huh?
-(laughter)

11:58.384 --> 12:00.261
-MAN: Easy enough.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.679
Seems to be stuck.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.140
(laughing)

12:04.223 --> 12:08.102
There's always a bug or two
with new technology.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.481
Well, uh, this can't wait.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.401
Officer, would you take your seat, please,

12:15.484 --> 12:19.613
while we move on to the taser gun?

12:20.072 --> 12:24.118
This is taser model TF-76.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.329
Hey. Hey, Harris,
get this thing off my neck.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.748
Come on. Come on.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.874
She wants me.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.585
Come on! I look like an idiot.
Get this thing off my neck.

12:32.668 --> 12:33.586
Come on.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.754
What happened to you?

12:34.837 --> 12:36.380
(telephone ringing)

12:37.548 --> 12:39.800
Young lady like you oughta be
in school or something.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.219
-If I was your daddy, I'd make you.
-Well, he didn't.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.888
What is this?

12:43.971 --> 12:45.806
Did you get
some really good stuff in there?

12:45.890 --> 12:46.766
I got some.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.267
Ah ha ha.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.020
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Forget it, lover.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.940
She's a professional brow-beater
with the 11:00 news, you know?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.985
Always did want to get into the news.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.487
Oh, man.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.322
Washington.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.575
(mumbles)

13:06.160 --> 13:07.828
Don't make a fool of yourself, son.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.789
You're not ready yet.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.374
(chuckles)

13:16.754 --> 13:18.005
Okay.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.134
Kevin, I'm sorry.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.929
I'm going to have to lock you up
till your bail comes through.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.264
Please, Officer.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.977
I don't think
I can do very well in a jail cell.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.980
No, come on. It ain't so bad.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.319
No. No, please.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.489
Don't put me in a jail cell, please.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.242
It's standard procedure, Kevin.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.451
This is no big deal.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.912
No, please, don't. Don't put me, please.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.749
Bates. Bates, tell Kevin here
that going into a cell

13:53.833 --> 13:56.085
is your standard vampire procedure.
You tell him.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.087
Standard procedure, all right.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.215
Talking your basic, standard way
of doing things.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.132
That's all.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.343
-No! No!
-Come on, Kevin.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.261
-Come on!
-No!

14:05.344 --> 14:07.221
Come on. Come on, get down from there.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.305
(shouts)

14:08.389 --> 14:09.807
(panting)

14:09.890 --> 14:12.601
-MICK: Kevin!
-Yah! (hissing)

14:12.685 --> 14:14.812
Take it easy. Just calm down.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.564
(indistinct chatter)

14:16.647 --> 14:19.108
It's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.235
-KEVIN: (shouts)
-MICK: Come on, take it easy, pal.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.445
-Please, I just want you to calm down.
-KEVIN: (grunts)

14:23.529 --> 14:26.073
-You better get him down to psychiatric.
-(bang)

14:26.156 --> 14:27.449
(glass shatters)

14:27.533 --> 14:31.662
(hissing)

14:31.745 --> 14:33.747
-Harris, don't hurt him. Harris!
-No!

14:33.831 --> 14:35.499
-(panting)
-Kevin!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.626
KEVIN: (hissing)

14:37.710 --> 14:39.879
You better get down from there right now

14:40.421 --> 14:42.089
before I have to use force on you.

14:44.091 --> 14:44.925
Kevin.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.887
(hissing)

14:48.387 --> 14:50.097
All right, you asked for it.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.349
(shouts)

14:53.976 --> 14:55.144
KEVIN: No.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.187
(sobbing)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.527
You going to behave?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.863
(whimpers)

15:07.489 --> 15:08.449
MICK: All right.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.951
I want you to give me your hand.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.454
Just nice and easy.
Just give me your hand.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.415
That's right. That's it. That's right.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.627
Okay, now we're going
to come off that desk.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.295
Come on. Nice and slow, nice and slow.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.546
Easy does it.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.548
Everything's going to be okay.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.508
Just come on down off the desk.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.094
Okay.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.972
KEVIN: (whimpering)

15:33.390 --> 15:38.020
Please.
Please, just don't send me to psychiatric.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.272
Aah! All right.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.733
Okay.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.902
-(telephone ringing)
-MICK: Okay.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.320
Okay. Okay.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.572
All right. Come on.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.536
MAN: Frank, it's ballistics on pound 5.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.795
(whimpering)

16:05.339 --> 16:08.342
That is a sad commentary
on our society, gentlemen.

16:08.842 --> 16:13.013
A dangerous misfit deriving
his identity from a media myth.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.393
You took the words right out
of my mouth, Lieutenant.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.604
Very insightful, sir. Very.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.364
-Excuse me, would you?
-Mm-hmm.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.824
Excuse us.

16:34.994 --> 16:35.828
MAN: Hill Street.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.579
Appreciate it, Sam.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.872
Yeah, take care.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.877
Frank, where would you like
to situate Belker's suspect?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.255
I don't think he will mix
with our other guests.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.049
If maintenance is through converting
that cell in the basement,

16:49.133 --> 16:51.635
we can hold him there.
Tell him it's the vampire lounge.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.762
Hmm, that's a good idea, Francis.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.765
Why not have Hill and Renko
take Miss Chase

16:56.849 --> 16:58.726
out on their rounds with them today?

16:58.809 --> 17:02.062
And I want LaRue and Washington
in here immediately.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.066
I take it it's the gun
that shot Hill and Renko?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.153
Yeah.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.155
We got the gun.

17:11.238 --> 17:14.158
-(typing)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

17:17.411 --> 17:18.871
I thought you didn't like handling

17:18.954 --> 17:21.248
-Lambart Reese.
-No, this is a media event, my friend,

17:21.331 --> 17:24.001
and in the interests
of departmental image,

17:24.084 --> 17:26.462
I feel I televise
a little better than you do.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.713
You know the public taste.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.215
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, I sure do.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.306
(chickens clucking)

17:37.389 --> 17:39.516
Okay, cowboy, it's your show.

17:40.142 --> 17:46.690
(coughs) All right, Bernard, uh,
is this good for you right here?

17:46.774 --> 17:49.234
Composition's not so hot.
Could you step to your left, sir?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.694
-Okay, back here?
-That's good.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.029
-Fine. Can you hear me?
-Okay.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.614
-Go for it.
-Here we go now.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.407
(knocks)

17:57.910 --> 18:00.287
-What do you want, man?
-Well, good afternoon, ma'am.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.957
My name is Officer Renko,
and this is Officer Hill.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.169
We are from the Hill Street station,
and we are here in answer to a complaint

18:07.252 --> 18:09.421
that you are harboring live animals.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.423
Go away, man. I got no animals here.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.927
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we are here
on a complaint that your landlord lodged

18:15.010 --> 18:18.972
that last night you took delivery
of three chickens and a goat.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.642
-I told you I got no animals up here.
-(chickens clucking)

18:21.725 --> 18:23.393
Ma'am, look, I'm sorry,

18:23.477 --> 18:25.521
but I distinctly hear the sound

18:25.604 --> 18:27.898
of chickens clucking
from inside your premises.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.150
You heard nothing. Go on now.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.070
Leave me be, you rasty-faced fool.

18:33.153 --> 18:33.987
Hm. Yeah.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.200
-What does "rasty-faced" m--
-(door slams)

18:40.160 --> 18:42.996
She took my, uh, my night stick.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.498
(knocks)

18:44.581 --> 18:47.543
Ma'am, could you open the door, please,

18:47.626 --> 18:49.795
and return the police property

18:49.878 --> 18:52.464
that you have illegally,
um, boarded in there?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.508
(chickens clucking)

18:55.259 --> 18:56.426
(knocks) Ma'am!

18:57.553 --> 19:01.098
I have to inform you
that if you don't open up this door,

19:01.181 --> 19:04.434
I'm going to have to use physical force
to get inside there!

19:04.518 --> 19:07.271
Wait. Don't bust it in yet.
I got to reload.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.441
You do that and I'll put
that camera down your throat, boy.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.693
Yes, sir.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.194
(exhales)

19:14.278 --> 19:16.113
Bobby? Would you,

19:16.196 --> 19:17.865
would you help me get in here, please?

19:17.948 --> 19:21.493
Aw, but, cowboy,
you televise so much better.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.453
(chickens clucking)

19:28.167 --> 19:31.837
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know!

19:33.922 --> 19:37.509
You dropped
this driver's license and welfare check

19:37.593 --> 19:40.888
with this purse you dumped.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.723
Who is this Rita Perez? Who?

19:42.806 --> 19:43.640
I don't know.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.143
Is that the person you got the gun from?

19:52.941 --> 19:54.693
You rip off her apartment building?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.201
Maybe your old man ripped her off.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.830
-You want us to bust your old man, Billie?
-Look, I don't know.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.666
Keep it up, kid.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.461
We got all day.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.676
What's his story?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.888
Well, he claims that a group
of rather large gentlemen

20:22.971 --> 20:26.099
jumped out of a black van on Hertel

20:26.183 --> 20:28.185
and stole all his clothes.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.186
Black van?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.605
I thought that problem
was limited to the east side.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.858
Well, we are a transient society, Francis.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.069
Listen, have someone pick
up this Rita Perez.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.821
Seems to me that .357
tracks in her direction.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.074
Hmm, I'll put Belker on it forthwith.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.952
And, Phil, let's not advertise
this any more than we have to.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.788
I don't see any point
in involving Hill and Renko just yet.

20:47.871 --> 20:48.872
Uh-huh.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.796
-(telephone ringing)
-(indistinct chatter)

21:01.593 --> 21:02.636
Belker.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
I just asked you to bring in Mrs. Perez,

21:06.348 --> 21:07.808
not the whole household.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.101
I know.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.271
I flash my badge at the door,
the dirtball takes a swipe at me.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.440
I'm going to find out
where you live, Mr. <i>Policía.</i>

21:15.524 --> 21:17.359
(growls)

21:18.193 --> 21:19.528
And when I do...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.488
Of course, he had a lot to hide, Sarge.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.199
Looked like he had half
the department store in his pad.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.953
Mrs. Perez, would you mind
terribly leaving your little one

21:28.036 --> 21:31.290
with Officer Belker here
while we ask you a few questions?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.083
Oh, he's very good with children.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.003
You take my baby, I want a receipt.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.004
You got it.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.589
One baby.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.049
There you go.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.011
Hey, wait a minute. Sarge?

21:44.094 --> 21:46.054
There you go. His name is Joey.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.264
Be good, honey.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.182
Ho ho. This way, folks, hmm?

21:49.266 --> 21:52.561
-(cries)
-Aw. This way.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.982
(high voice) Joey. Joey.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.192
(screams)

22:01.528 --> 22:03.363
Joey.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.115
(screams)

22:05.198 --> 22:06.158
(cries)

22:06.241 --> 22:10.495
-(speaking Spanish)
-Hey, hey, hey! (shouts in Spanish)

22:10.954 --> 22:14.416
-Well, seems you two ladies have met.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.335
Hey, I never saw her before in my life.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.086
-(speaks Spanish)
-Hey, hey, hey.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.588
All right, knock it off.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.841
Ray, put the two ladies in the same cell

22:22.924 --> 22:24.926
and book them both for attempted murder.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.136
Him too.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.221
We'll let the district attorney handle it.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.264
Okay, let's go.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.684
No, wait. Hey, look, I bought that stuff
off her this morning on Elmwood.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.935
Hey, she lying.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.812
It was an alley off Elmwood.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.314
PEREZ: I never seen this broad in my life.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.733
So, okay, I knocked the chick
down and I took it, okay?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.443
But the gun, it was in the bag, too.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.488
Maybe you two better have a seat.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.035
Be sure to Mirandize them, Ray.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.747
Sit.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.166
How about a little cookie here, huh?

22:56.249 --> 22:58.502
Here's a little cookie. Here you go, Joey.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.087
Come on, take that little cookie,

23:00.170 --> 23:02.547
put the little cookie in your fingers,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.424
now put the little cookie in your mouth.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.719
That's it. Ha ha ha ha.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.805
He's cute, huh?

23:09.888 --> 23:11.056
Pretty boy.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.808
(laughs)

23:12.891 --> 23:14.559
Phil, would you get me the D.A., please?

23:14.643 --> 23:15.727
Oh, of course.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.854
Joey, Joey, we're going to call the D.A.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.898
Come on. Here's the telephone.

23:19.981 --> 23:22.067
You get the telephone in your hand.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.026
That's it.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.445
You put down the cookie
and you hold the phone.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.073
That's it. We're going to call the D.A.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.617
(mumbles)

23:30.700 --> 23:32.536
Say hello. Come on, say hello to the D.A.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.453
Hello.

23:41.294 --> 23:44.297
Be with you in a minute, Counselor.
I'm in the middle of something.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.008
I know. It's called chronic incompetence

23:47.092 --> 23:49.761
and the continual misplacement
of my clients.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.638
Kevin Herman Dracula?

23:51.721 --> 23:52.973
Oh, you mean the vampire.

23:54.141 --> 23:58.145
Alleged vampire, Furillo.
Now, you want to locate him for me?

23:58.228 --> 24:00.397
He's in a private cell downstairs.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.523
Ray will show you down.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.693
Uh, wait a minute. Don't go, please.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.987
Yes, I'm holding.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.531
John, Frank Furillo.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.492
Yeah, we traced the gun to a Rita Perez.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.327
We're holding her and her husband.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.247
Uh, yeah, he's a petty thief.
Three priors.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.000
Listen, John, what I'd like
to get from you

24:20.083 --> 24:21.543
is a reject of this guy

24:21.626 --> 24:23.545
on that charge
of receiving stolen property

24:23.628 --> 24:25.464
in exchange for his cooperation.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.508
No, two reasons.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.926
The description doesn't match

24:30.010 --> 24:31.761
and he was in county jail
when it happened.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.974
Sure he'll have representation.

24:36.057 --> 24:39.227
In fact, public defender Joyce Davenport

24:39.311 --> 24:41.730
is sitting in my office this very moment.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.363
Right.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.365
Thank you, John.

24:55.368 --> 24:58.330
Among other things,
District Attorney Simonson allows

24:58.413 --> 25:01.917
is how he'd abandon his wife of 19 years

25:02.000 --> 25:04.294
just for a meaningful weekend with you.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.963
Tell him to take a number.

25:07.047 --> 25:10.300
Look, Furillo, I came here
to see a specific client,

25:10.383 --> 25:13.345
and in case you're not clued in yet
as to the process,

25:13.428 --> 25:15.805
I don't take my assignments
from the district attorney,

25:15.889 --> 25:18.767
nor the Easter Bunny,
and certainly not from you.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.852
We've got a lead
on the Hill-Renko shooting,

25:20.936 --> 25:23.355
a good one that might not wait
on the judicial process.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.857
You're on dangerous ground, Furillo.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.819
All I'm saying is you could
save us a lot of time.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.780
How so?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.785
I think I can persuade the D.A.
to reject these charges

25:36.868 --> 25:38.203
against you, Mr. Perez,

25:38.286 --> 25:40.038
in exchange for your cooperation.

25:41.873 --> 25:46.211
As your attorney of record,
I feel I'd be remiss

25:46.294 --> 25:49.172
if I didn't, uh,
read you the facts of life.

25:49.256 --> 25:53.051
Now, if I were the D.A., Mr. Perez,

25:54.302 --> 25:56.555
looking for an easy win,
I'd say you're it:

25:57.514 --> 26:01.184
a 3-time loser facing grand theft,

26:01.268 --> 26:04.854
illegal possession of a firearm,
obstruction of justice,

26:04.938 --> 26:07.148
and who knows what else
if the captain here

26:07.232 --> 26:09.192
decides to search your residence.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.319
So you've got two choices.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.863
You can let me try
for rejection of charges

26:13.947 --> 26:15.824
in exchange for your telling the police

26:15.907 --> 26:17.826
where you got the .357,

26:17.909 --> 26:21.246
or you can play macho man
and get the book jammed up your nose.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.416
(speaking Spanish)

26:24.499 --> 26:28.878
(shouting in Spanish)

26:28.962 --> 26:30.547
(shouting)

26:30.630 --> 26:32.424
(pants)

26:32.507 --> 26:34.301
I'd like to get a piece of him, Frank.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.261
Okay, come on, you two.
We're through in here.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.347
Let's go. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.016
Come on, come on.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.643
-Wait a minute, Captain.
-(Perez couple speaking Spanish)

26:43.727 --> 26:45.145
Miss Davenport?

26:45.228 --> 26:46.646
Great system up here.

26:52.527 --> 26:56.448
You give me back my birds, man!

26:56.531 --> 27:00.076
You tell that rusty fool
to fetch me back my birds!

27:00.160 --> 27:04.164
-No white-faced jolly-too-good gonna...
-Okay, okay. All right.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.125
-Okay! All right.
-Takes my animals!

27:07.208 --> 27:09.210
I got the power, fat boy,

27:09.294 --> 27:12.297
-and there's gonna be pins in your doll.
-Get him out of here, Renko.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.051
Y'all want to put this
in the evidence bin, Leo?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.595
One Rhode Island Red, deceased.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.763
How you doing, Freddie?

27:19.846 --> 27:22.057
What a shame. Good-looking chicken.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.225
-Voodoo, huh?
-Yeah, it's terrible.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.144
They had that hot llama stuck
up on the altar

27:26.227 --> 27:29.105
-when I busted in there.
-No, they were executing Cookie?

27:29.189 --> 27:31.399
No, I got a stay of execution
from the SPCA.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.318
Took it back to the zoo. It was terrible.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.987
(coughing)

27:36.071 --> 27:37.197
That don't sound too good.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.574
You want a bowl of soup
or something, Freddie?

27:40.825 --> 27:43.119
Uh, roll call's empty.
You can sleep down there.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.000
He claims he got it in trade
for a television set

27:49.084 --> 27:51.461
from someone calling himself George

27:51.544 --> 27:55.423
who used to do odd jobs for D-Boy Liquors
over on Richmond Avenue.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.550
George supposedly bought it
off the owner--

27:57.634 --> 28:00.512
Excuse me, Ray.
Hill and Renko just checked in.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.389
Maybe you ought to take them aside.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.142
This George character,
does he have a last name?

28:06.226 --> 28:09.354
Perez says he's a rail gypsy,
but he hasn't seen him since.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.898
Send Larue and Washington
down to D-Boy Liquors.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.776
-Have them put it to the owner.
-What about Perez and the ladies?

28:14.859 --> 28:17.696
Seems to me they've been dealt
a rejection of charges

28:17.779 --> 28:19.114
by the D.A.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.990
Isn't that true, Captain?

28:21.616 --> 28:24.869
As soon as you've got their statements,
you can let them go, Ray.

28:26.746 --> 28:27.747
All right.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.335
Francis, uh, what about Hill and Renko?

28:32.419 --> 28:34.754
Let's see what Larue and Washington
come up with first.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.756
I'd hate stirring them up for nothing.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.717
Esterhaus wouldn't give me a clue,

28:38.800 --> 28:41.177
but the word is
they found a .357 this morning,

28:41.261 --> 28:43.930
and they connected it with
a Puerto Rican terrorist group.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.515
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.600
Make way for deposit. Hey, fellas.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.519
Oh, look who we have here.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.771
Gentlemen, have you met my new protégé?

28:51.855 --> 28:54.190
I'm teaching him to live life
in the fast lane.

28:54.274 --> 28:57.110
Yeah, did you tell them how I had
to get your night stick back for you,

28:57.193 --> 28:58.653
you rasty-faced fool?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.697
Do you know what that means,
rasty-faced fool?

29:00.780 --> 29:03.408
I don't either.
Anyway, 8:00 tonight, my place,

29:03.491 --> 29:05.577
fresh deck of cards
and all the money you can lose.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.661
How about it?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.621
-We got a report to write.
-Yeah, we gotta go.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.790
-I thought that you were going to play.
-Sorry.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.879
Did I say something wrong?

29:17.088 --> 29:18.173
I don't know.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.551
Hmm.

29:36.775 --> 29:41.696
Let me tell you, lady, never in my career
have I seen machines this brutalized.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.990
Inhumanly brutalized!

29:44.073 --> 29:45.617
Hey, don't I know you?

29:46.951 --> 29:49.871
You're on television.
You're... don't tell me, uh...

29:49.954 --> 29:50.955
Cynthia Chase.

29:51.039 --> 29:54.000
-No, not her.
-No, but I am her.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.460
-Really?
-Well, yes.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.086
I watch you all the time.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.880
Thank you. I'm glad.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.132
Cynthia Chase.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.429
WOMAN: Ma'am, can you turn the radio down?

30:06.513 --> 30:07.639
I can't hear you.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.686
Uh, sir, you...

30:14.604 --> 30:15.814
Having trouble?

30:15.897 --> 30:18.525
Well, this machine doesn't want
to cough up my yogurt.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.652
Allow me.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.949
-(kicks the machine)
-(machine beeps)

30:27.408 --> 30:29.202
You just have to know how to touch.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.832
Thanks. Um?

30:37.377 --> 30:40.046
I trust you're having a profitable visit.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.007
I'd say it falls somewhere
between a five and a one.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.885
Mm, don't say. I'm sorry to hear that.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.471
It's not that I didn't expect
a certain amount of runaround,

30:48.555 --> 30:50.807
you understand,
it's just that I was hoping that...

30:53.518 --> 30:56.479
look, I understand
that it must be very scary out there,

30:56.563 --> 30:58.773
and I know it must be hard for
you guys to talk about it,

30:58.857 --> 31:00.275
especially to outsiders, but I--

31:00.358 --> 31:02.819
Then you must be hanging out
with the scared crowd.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.114
I'm in the middle of
an investigation right now,

31:06.197 --> 31:07.949
the Melchel film.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.117
Tape.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.578
Yeah. You know what I mean.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.039
I somehow thought that
the investigators investigated.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.667
(chuckles) Yeah, well, they've been
known to help out.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.835
Let's go, man.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.713
Esterhaus wants us to take the guy home.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.508
Poor guy.
His wife's going to have him neutered.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.343
It's called the black van.

31:27.427 --> 31:31.055
Three or four prostitutes
will cruise an area turning tricks inside.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.267
If they think that a john
has got a lot of money on him

31:34.350 --> 31:36.686
or if he's getting out of line,

31:36.769 --> 31:38.980
they'll rip him off
and they'll toss him out the back.

31:39.063 --> 31:42.150
-And that's what happened to him?
-Oh, not according to him.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.819
According to him,
it was nine 8-foot black dudes

31:44.903 --> 31:46.404
carrying spears.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.991
Hey, listen, I'll, uh,
catch you later, okay?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.120
(inaudible chattering)

32:04.339 --> 32:06.049
Can you hang a date on what day that was?

32:06.132 --> 32:07.675
Look, I don't know.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.803
Come on, it was at least six months ago.

32:11.638 --> 32:12.764
Please, have a heart.

32:12.847 --> 32:15.433
Have a heart, you guys.
Let me explain you something.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.478
That was an unregistered firearm.
That's 1,000 bucks to the judge.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.813
George said you gave it to him,
and George is an ex-con.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.273
It's very serious, Mr. DiCarlo.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.859
No, no, no, no, no, he took it from me.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.694
I didn't give it to him.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.780
Now, I swear that's the truth.

32:30.698 --> 32:34.327
Okay, okay, uh, just let me think, huh?

32:34.410 --> 32:35.536
Give me a second.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.376
Wait a minute. I, uh,

32:42.001 --> 32:46.172
I found a thing
after I reorganized the shelves.

32:46.255 --> 32:50.510
That was back late March,
early April, around Easter.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.305
Well, what's the big deal, anyway?

32:54.389 --> 32:56.683
So I kept the gun. I'm sorry.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.768
Two police officers
were shot down with that gun

32:58.851 --> 33:00.228
less than half a block from here.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.856
We've had every cop in this precinct
looking for that weapon for six months.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.986
135 cops obstructed by you, Mr. DiCarlo.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.113
Are you putting the blame on me, huh?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.866
Are you putting the bl... oh, come on.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.868
Now, you get your own act together.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.539
I been ripped off here about eight times,

33:19.622 --> 33:21.374
and the only time I see your boys

33:21.457 --> 33:23.459
is when they want a case
wholesale or something,

33:23.543 --> 33:25.294
so stop laying the crap on me.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.214
(panting)

33:30.758 --> 33:35.596
Look, how was I supposed to know that
that had anything to do with this, huh?

33:36.806 --> 33:41.477
Look, uh, I don't want to put
anybody on the dime, you know?

33:41.561 --> 33:44.605
Especially me, but, well, um...

33:46.524 --> 33:49.110
maybe out of left field,
but I had an inkling.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.196
You see, uh, there's this guy
keeps coming in here.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.282
He's a nice kid. Ex-junkie.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.324
Kid got a name?

33:55.408 --> 33:58.244
Yeah, Eddie Hoban.
I cash his welfare for him.

33:58.327 --> 34:02.749
Anyway, two days,
a week after I find the thing,

34:02.832 --> 34:06.711
his girlfriend comes in here,
she disappears back there.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.379
And she's on her hands and knees.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.048
She's searching around the freezer.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.175
I say to her, "What are you looking for?"

34:12.258 --> 34:13.634
She gets up, she runs off.

34:13.718 --> 34:14.802
Lady have a name?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.596
Yeah, Sherry Marie.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.598
You got an address on this Eddie Hoban?

34:18.681 --> 34:21.017
You go down the corner
to Pelham and you turn right.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.936
It's about, uh, three buildings up.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.944
(upbeat music playing)

34:32.028 --> 34:35.239
(dog barking)

34:39.202 --> 34:41.329
(telephone rings)

34:42.246 --> 34:44.373
(ring)

34:47.043 --> 34:48.920
Eddie, telephone!

34:49.003 --> 34:50.463
Telephone for Eddie!

34:56.219 --> 34:57.220
-Yeah?
-Be cool, Eddie.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.680
-Turn around, put your hands on your head.
-What is this?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.891
-WOMAN: What are you doing?
-I didn't do anything.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.769
-Yeah.
-WOMAN: What are you doing?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.147
-I never.
-Okay, come on up, babe.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.191
-It's cool. We got him.
-What has this boy done?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.275
I ain't done nothing.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.535
Hmm. You still here, Counselor?

35:20.618 --> 35:23.287
I have spent the better part of an hour

35:23.371 --> 35:26.457
trying to coax my client
out of his vampire lounge,

35:26.541 --> 35:29.085
as someone here has chosen to call it.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.296
While I hunger for your body, Counselor,

35:33.214 --> 35:37.093
I find I'm stuck with
tuna fish on whole wheat.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.472
He loves it down there.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.518
He's watching television.
Someone gave him a television set.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.019
All part of the new image.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.565
He's an outpatient, Furillo.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.943
Outpatients must either be
released to custody

35:54.026 --> 35:56.112
or bound over to mental evaluation.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.405
That's the law.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.991
Hey, seriously, I thought you two
were out of here hours ago.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.869
Ray, would you help the counselor

36:02.952 --> 36:05.913
pry her client loose
from the vampire lounge?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.331
(sighs) Frank.

36:08.749 --> 36:09.667
Phil?

36:10.168 --> 36:13.045
Would you help Miss Davenport
with her client, please?

36:14.672 --> 36:16.174
Appreciate it, pizza man.

36:18.926 --> 36:22.555
I've not only had clients
unlawfully detained.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.183
At present I have a client
who has vanished

36:25.266 --> 36:27.560
into a bureaucratic black hole,

36:27.643 --> 36:29.729
physically lost somewhere in the system.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.190
Your pervert, as I recall, Miss Davenport.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.900
Alleged pervert, Sergeant.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.902
I stand corrected, Counselor.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.740
(Phil sighs)

36:45.494 --> 36:47.371
Visitors, Mr. Dracula.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.215
I think we'd better call the captain.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.257
Please.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.801
Please.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.615
I told maintenance to check walls
and ceilings for leaks.

37:23.282 --> 37:27.745
I told them to cover all pipes
with real lath and plaster.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.333
Look at it. We couldn't have
made it easier for him,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.544
and we never thought to check.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.005
Your warning's on record, Francis.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.590
Small thanks for that.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.718
Wouldn't want it off the record, would we?

37:43.427 --> 37:44.553
Take it easy.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.889
He was fine.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.350
When I left him, he was fine.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.518
We know that.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.104
Want someone to drive you home?

38:02.947 --> 38:04.991
Larue and Washington just came in.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.661
What's odd is we were probably
more obliging to this one

38:08.744 --> 38:10.204
than we are to most.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.039
In fact, we probably overdid it

38:12.123 --> 38:14.208
because nobody took him too seriously…

38:14.917 --> 38:18.462
not me, not you either, Counselor,

38:18.546 --> 38:20.423
and nobody bothered to check on him.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.967
Sorry for the speech.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.429
You okay?

38:29.098 --> 38:30.308
Yeah.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.643
Excuse me.

38:32.727 --> 38:36.272
(dramatic music playing)

39:04.091 --> 39:07.094
I swear, I've never even seen
that gun before.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.389
I mean, I don't even know
how to use one of these things.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.060
That's the truth, man.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.062
I swear to God.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.022
Tell me about last March, Eddie.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.190
Where were you?

39:20.024 --> 39:21.150
Last March?

39:23.652 --> 39:25.529
Here. I was here.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.531
Do better than that.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.867
Start on the 1st of March.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.036
You kidding me?

39:32.119 --> 39:35.664
I can't remember that,
I mean, that's six, seven, six months ago.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.666
Maybe Sherry Marie
would help you remember.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.835
She was living with you then, right?

39:40.795 --> 39:41.879
Yeah.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.506
You got her phone number, babe?

39:43.589 --> 39:45.466
No. I mean, we split up.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.426
Ahem.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.929
You know how that goes.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.808
Ahem.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.895
Hey, uh, you suppose I could get
a drink of water

39:57.978 --> 39:59.939
-or something like that?
-Oh, sure thing.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.942
You want something to eat?

40:03.692 --> 40:05.069
No, thanks. That's okay.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.739
Put Sherry Marie's name
down on the pad for me,

40:08.823 --> 40:09.907
will you, babe?

40:10.991 --> 40:12.827
-First and last.
-Sure.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.372
That half a bag's not even mine, man.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.332
I mean, I was just holding that for a guy.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.376
We're not worried about your dope, Eddie.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.628
Appreciate that, Eddie.

40:22.711 --> 40:25.256
We just want to know
where you were last March.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.009
Why don't we start with Sundays?

40:31.470 --> 40:33.055
What do you do on Sundays in March?

40:34.515 --> 40:35.558
(laughs)

40:36.642 --> 40:37.601
I...

40:41.063 --> 40:42.314
(sighs)

40:42.398 --> 40:44.817
So, how about some cream and coffee?

40:44.900 --> 40:46.193
Sugar.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.736
What you say, lover?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.029
Say okay, Bobby.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.992
What's going on in that
interrogation room?

40:53.075 --> 40:54.201
You catch a big fish?

40:54.285 --> 40:57.496
Mm-mm. Little fish.
I'm making him swim in this.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.332
No doubt a purveyor of dangerous
narcotic substances, right?

41:00.416 --> 41:02.626
-No doubt whatsoever.
-No doubt whatsoever.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.296
Well, well, here comes your better half.

41:06.922 --> 41:10.092
What's going on, babe? What's the problem?

41:10.176 --> 41:12.678
Well, the problem
at this particular time is recruitment.

41:12.761 --> 41:15.014
We had a game scheduled
for tonight with eight people.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.600
Now it's just me and Bobby,
we'd like to know what the deal is.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.311
Better reschedule it.
Maybe tonight's a bad night.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.063
No, what we're saying, man,
is that we've been getting

41:23.147 --> 41:26.609
the back of people's heads all day
and getting one-word answers,

41:27.151 --> 41:30.279
and everyone in this room
keeps staring at that door.

41:30.362 --> 41:33.365
I mean, what's going on, man?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.910
I mean, if something's going on
in there that concerns me--

41:35.993 --> 41:37.745
-Excuse me, guys.
-Sure, Henry.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.872
Henry, just a minute.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.874
(telephone rings)

41:44.043 --> 41:45.794
(ring)

41:48.589 --> 41:50.966
MAN: Hill Street Station.
Can you hold, please?

41:51.050 --> 41:53.511
Take a seat in viewing, you two.
I'll be with you in a minute.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.555
Go on in, Henry.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.974
Take a seat in viewing.

42:12.446 --> 42:13.781
Let's find the girlfriend.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.000
You know, I don't like this one damn bit.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.919
I think we're getting
set up for something.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.921
Did you see him in there? I mean...

42:29.630 --> 42:31.173
All right. So what?

42:31.257 --> 42:33.425
-I mean, why are you worried?
-I don't know.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.469
It's just street trash
like that can work you up

42:35.553 --> 42:39.014
one side of the street and down the other.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

42:47.439 --> 42:48.566
Okay,

42:49.483 --> 42:51.860
I've kept you in the clear on this
as long as I could,

42:51.944 --> 42:53.946
but that doesn't seem to be
working anymore.

42:54.863 --> 42:57.116
Detective Goldblume
is gonna bring in some suspects.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.159
I want you to tell me
if you recognize anyone.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.287
Okay, Henry.

43:20.222 --> 43:21.807
What does this relate to, Captain?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.393
Have them turn around, Henry, all the way.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.872
Oh, God, that's him.

43:50.586 --> 43:53.297
This guy right here on the right.
This guy right here.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.715
Okay, sit down, Renko.

43:54.798 --> 43:57.009
Don't tell me to sit down.
That's the guy that shot me.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.553
That's all, Henry. Sit down.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.598
I could pick a guy like that
out of a 200-mile lineup.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.560
What about you, Bobby?

44:06.644 --> 44:07.770
Bobby?

44:10.147 --> 44:11.231
(exhales)

44:15.069 --> 44:16.445
Yeah, that's him.

44:16.528 --> 44:18.989
You don't forget about a thing
like that as long as you live.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.866
No way, not as long as you live.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.660
Damn! You got him.

44:23.619 --> 44:26.372
Okay, we'll meet with the
prosecutor in the morning.

44:26.455 --> 44:30.167
Bobby, meantime, I don't want you
to discuss this with anybody.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.168
Bobby?

44:35.714 --> 44:37.758
I think we can make this kid
circumstantially.

44:37.841 --> 44:38.842
I think we can do that.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.182
Okay, that's all.

44:46.892 --> 44:49.687
(sentimental music playing)

44:58.779 --> 44:59.780
Okay.

45:04.785 --> 45:08.163
Francis, I just finished the go-around
with psychiatric.

45:08.247 --> 45:11.291
They confirmed the suspect
in a drug rehabilitation program

45:11.375 --> 45:12.626
with a Doctor Shimmert.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.878
Get this,
on the afternoon of the shooting,

45:14.962 --> 45:20.092
he signed in at 1:10 P.M.,
signed out at 4:55 P.M.,

45:20.175 --> 45:22.761
attending his regular 50-minute session.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.222
Psychiatric is less than ten blocks

45:25.305 --> 45:26.890
from the scene of the shooting.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.768
It's conceivable he signed in,
got restless,

45:29.852 --> 45:31.145
and went out for some action.

45:31.228 --> 45:33.105
A lot can happen in two hours.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.108
Wait a minute.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.905
Henry, would you
come out here a second, please?

45:50.122 --> 45:53.292
Henry, what's the setup
at County Psychiatric?

45:53.375 --> 45:54.960
Between the time a patient signs in

45:55.043 --> 45:57.546
and the time he sees his doctor,
how free is it up there?

45:57.629 --> 45:59.423
Can we walk out without signing out?

46:00.340 --> 46:01.425
It's possible.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.051
It's a busy place.

46:03.635 --> 46:05.596
Look, Frank, for what it's worth,

46:06.555 --> 46:10.100
I knew that kid in there before
when he was shooting up three times a day.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.354
When he says he's never
picked up a gun, I believe him.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.106
Renko I.D.'d him, Henry.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.862
I don't believe it, Frank. I'm sorry.

46:28.911 --> 46:29.995
(sighs)

46:30.078 --> 46:32.539
You're being charged
with the attempted homicide

46:32.623 --> 46:36.168
of two officers during
the commission of a felony.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.712
You're also charged
with possession of heroin

46:38.796 --> 46:40.297
at the time of arrest.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.717
We're now going to transfer you
to the Michigan Avenue complex.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.387
I swear to God, man,
I didn't shoot anybody.

46:47.471 --> 46:48.931
It's going to be okay, son.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.980
(water dripping)

46:57.689 --> 46:59.566
MAN: It's raining cats and dogs out there.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.777
-MAN: Get something warm.
-MAN 2: You want to get some soup?

47:16.917 --> 47:18.377
(knocks)

47:27.511 --> 47:29.137
You're soaking wet.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.474
I drove to the shore and back.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.393
With the top down?

47:36.019 --> 47:38.772
It's stuck. (laughs, sniffles)

47:38.856 --> 47:40.399
I couldn't get it up.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.988
I just want you to know
I don't blame you for what happened today.

47:46.071 --> 47:47.990
Don't blame yourself, either.

47:48.949 --> 47:50.617
I just feel so awful.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.996
Excuse me, Captain. Arrest reports.
Want to sign them?

47:54.079 --> 47:56.248
-Is the morning okay?
-Sure.

48:00.377 --> 48:02.337
-(sighs)
-Want me to go home with you?

48:05.090 --> 48:08.719
(sentimental music playing)

48:20.939 --> 48:22.190
Are you going to cry?

48:26.486 --> 48:27.696
Yes, you are.

48:39.291 --> 48:44.004
(theme music playing)
