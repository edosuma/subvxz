[theme music playing]

00:50.184 --> 00:53.053
[music playing]

00:56.657 --> 00:58.759
Roseanne, ya all ready to go?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.594
I don't want to.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.500
I feel like a used piece
of gum that somebody stuck

01:06.534 --> 01:11.205
under the table just waiting
for the excitement of drying

01:11.239 --> 01:13.441
up and hitting the floor.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.808
JACKIE: Come on, Roseanne.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.177
[clapping]

01:16.210 --> 01:17.245
Come on.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.213
You got to get it up
for this interview.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.081
I can't even get it
up to put my shoes on.

01:21.115 --> 01:21.982
Come on.

01:22.015 --> 01:22.950
Up and at them.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.618
Duh, duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh, duh,

01:24.652 --> 01:28.222
duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

01:28.256 --> 01:31.692
I have reached
an all-time low.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.893
I quit my job at Wellman.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.928
I didn't make it at phone sales.

01:34.962 --> 01:38.766
I got fired by some zit-faced
brat at Chicken Divine.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.034
Now I am actually going
in to apply for a job

01:41.068 --> 01:43.237
wherein I will
make coffee, answer

01:43.271 --> 01:46.507
phones, and sweep the floors.

01:46.540 --> 01:52.413
But those are all things
that you do very, very well.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.182
Those are all things
that I do at home.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.517
JACKIE: Yes, but now you'll
be getting paid for them.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.352
And besides, you
might like the people,

01:58.386 --> 02:01.655
and that can always make a big
difference in just getting you

02:01.689 --> 02:04.057
back out in the world again.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.960
[music playing]

02:12.032 --> 02:13.501
Hi!

02:13.534 --> 02:15.002
And you are?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.671
Roseanne Connor.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.240
Do you have an appointment?

02:19.273 --> 02:22.643
Well, not for my hair, but,
uh, my friend Crystal Anderson

02:22.676 --> 02:24.678
said that she talked to you.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.579
Oh!

02:25.613 --> 02:27.648
Yes, you're here about the job.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.082
I guess.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.784
Would you like some coffee?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.286
Yeah.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.358
Because if the coffee's no
good, I ain't working here.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.828
We drip brew our coffee
because the other way

02:40.861 --> 02:42.630
may raise your cholesterol.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.566
At least that's what
they're saying this week.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.935
I'm very careful
about my cholesterol.

02:47.968 --> 02:54.141
My husband, Arthur,
died of a heart attack.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.443
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.779
Oh, it was 30 years ago.

02:58.812 --> 03:02.283
He never even drank coffee.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.183
That's Debbie.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.084
That's Iris.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.085
This is Roseanne.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.454
Hi.
Hi.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.355
DEBBIE AND IRIS: Hi.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.756
That's my staff.

03:08.789 --> 03:09.957
I'm Marsha.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.058
Here, sit down.

03:14.662 --> 03:20.067
So why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.636
Well, I'm married
and I have three kids,

03:22.670 --> 03:25.339
and so, like, I never can
come in before 9:00 because I

03:25.373 --> 03:26.474
have to get them off to school.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.208
And I can't say after
5:00 because then I have

03:28.242 --> 03:29.377
to go home and make dinner.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.845
Weekends are out because,
you know, obviously.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.615
Besides my kids, I
have a husband who's

03:34.648 --> 03:38.151
like, totally dependent on me.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.588
Then three, four days a
month, I'm unbearable.

03:43.056 --> 03:43.924
Perfect.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.426
Can you start tomorrow?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.094
Why?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.697
Because I need someone
to start tomorrow.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.998
Well, I mean,
I don't even know

03:51.031 --> 03:52.533
if I'm going to take this job.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.701
You have to take this job.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.768
You were the only
one who applied.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.373
Oh, you'll like it here.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.274
Look!

04:00.308 --> 04:02.109
You already know everyone.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.844
Yeah, well, you know, I just--

04:03.877 --> 04:05.946
I would just kind of
like to think about it.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.848
Think about what?

04:07.881 --> 04:10.951
If it's that miserable, you
either quit or I unload you.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.454
Well, as long as there's
some kind of humiliation

04:13.487 --> 04:16.290
at the end of the tunnel.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.126
[music playing]

04:21.629 --> 04:23.531
DAN: Chain me down.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.766
Chain me down or bring me down.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.535
The mirror is all steamed up.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.303
How am I supposed to
get ready for my crappy,

04:29.337 --> 04:31.271
stinking new career?

04:31.305 --> 04:33.541
You got to be polite
and be cheerful.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.610
Kill them with a smile.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.312
You know, you're right.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.613
I'm going to go
in there, and I'm

04:39.647 --> 04:41.315
going to tell that
nice lady that I

04:41.349 --> 04:44.217
just can't take this job.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.586
How am I right?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.421
Because my
attitude does stink.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.857
Hey, Rose, why don't
you give it a chance?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.293
You've been wanting to get back
to work, get out of the house.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.163
I do want to get out
of this house, this hell

04:56.196 --> 05:01.702
hole, this prison without
bars, this den of inequality,

05:01.735 --> 05:03.437
this monkey on our back--

05:03.471 --> 05:05.373
Maybe you're not in
the best frame of mind.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.273
No.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.240
No.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.776
I am in the perfect
frame of mind.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.243
I'm in a great frame of mind.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.311
I'm just going to go in there--

05:11.345 --> 05:12.613
Eek!

05:12.646 --> 05:14.782
And I'm gonna tell Marsha
that I quit, and that's it.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.616
See ya.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.922
DAN (SINGING): All
I really wanna do--

05:21.955 --> 05:22.823
[toilet flushing]

05:22.856 --> 05:23.724
Oh!

05:23.757 --> 05:25.659
[shouting]

05:26.660 --> 05:29.497
[music playing]

05:29.530 --> 05:30.964
ROSEANNE: What time
will Marsha be here?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.199
Oh.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.335
Her first appointment
today won't be until 11:00,

05:35.369 --> 05:37.971
so why don't I go ahead
and give you the tour?

05:38.005 --> 05:41.208
Well, I've already
seen the coffeemaker

05:41.241 --> 05:43.010
and I've met Arthur.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.414
Well, basically, all we need
is somebody to catch the phone,

05:46.447 --> 05:48.348
make coffee, and every
now and then make

05:48.382 --> 05:50.918
a path across the room
with a push broom.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.554
Oh, and, uh, clean
up after work.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.122
Well, I mean, I--

05:55.155 --> 05:56.657
I'm sure I can do
that and everything.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.992
I just-- I just don't
know if I really

05:59.026 --> 06:00.528
even want to take this job.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.463
Where did you get this cut?

06:02.496 --> 06:03.597
Um, in Molene.
Why?

06:03.631 --> 06:04.498
Don't you like it?

06:04.532 --> 06:06.033
Oh, it's a great look.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.234
Real sporty.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.136
You know people in Molene?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.505
No, just my parents.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
Yeah?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.008
My parents are both dead.

06:15.042 --> 06:15.909
Wow.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.546
Cool.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.380
I am so stupid.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.850
I am so, so stupid.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.051
No, you're not.

06:24.084 --> 06:24.952
Yes, I am.

06:24.985 --> 06:25.853
Hi.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.120
You're Roseanne?
- Yeah.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.188
Hi.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.058
Oh, you bit these
down to the knuckles.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.159
Yeah.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.194
Well, my real nails
are long and beautiful.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.831
These-- these stubs
are just fake.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.100
So what's your
problem, Debbie?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.569
Ever been married, Roseanne?

06:41.602 --> 06:45.873
Yeah, once, and it
kept dragging on and on.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.508
Hey, tell me about it.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.144
I've been married for six
weeks, and if he keeps this up,

06:51.178 --> 06:54.582
it's going to be over because
I just can't take this.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.683
This is torture.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.585
I mean, my life is a nightmare.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.352
Do you know what he did to me?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.121
He tried to make me feel bad.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.223
You poor thing.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.592
On purpose.

07:04.625 --> 07:10.764
You know, my first husband
was killed by a mortar attack.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.734
Oh, bummer.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.935
I think that says it all.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.540
Uh, where's the filters?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.309
[music playing]

07:25.245 --> 07:26.680
Could I have a little coffee?

07:26.714 --> 07:27.781
Oh, sure.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.116
I'll get it, Mrs. Wellman.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.786
I take it light with just
a half a pack of sweetener.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.923
Oh, and could you put in just
a [inaudible] of cold water

07:35.956 --> 07:37.491
so I don't burn my tongue?

07:37.525 --> 07:40.894
Anything for the dog?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.530
Didn't you used
to work for me?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.430
Yes, I did.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.498
For 11 years.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.066
That's right.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.435
Roxanne, isn't it?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.603
Yeah.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.771
Roxanne Conway.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.773
Conway!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.241
That's right.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.175
Hi, Meg.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.243
How are you doing, honey?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.845
Well, I've been better.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.514
And now I think I'm getting
this flu, among other things.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.715
Have Roseanne
get you some tea.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.616
Oh, no.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
Coffee is just fine.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.254
You know, I still have this
rough patch on my hand here.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.156
Did you have
Debbie look at that?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.057
Yeah, I looked at it.

08:10.090 --> 08:10.891
It's really gross.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.567
Did you see a
doctor about this?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.035
Oh, I think you've
got him impetigo.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.771
Oh, really?

08:23.804 --> 08:27.074
What's that?

08:27.107 --> 08:28.742
Uh, it's a skin rash.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.310
My kids get it all the time.

08:30.343 --> 08:36.383
It's, uh-- it's from wiping your
nose with your hand like that.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.385
You just need to put some
antibiotic cream on it,

08:38.418 --> 08:39.519
you know?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.922
And then-- and then, you
know, wash your hands

08:41.955 --> 08:43.023
every once in a while.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.062
All done, sweetie.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.063
OK, Jacques.

08:50.097 --> 08:50.964
Here we go.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.432
[phone ringing]

08:52.465 --> 08:55.636
Oh, I'll get it.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.037
Art's Beauty Shop.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.138
Art speaking.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.974
What can I do for you?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.442
Yeah.
Wednesday?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.276
Let me check the book.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.415
Uh, let's see.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.553
How's 10 o' clock?

09:13.587 --> 09:14.454
Great.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.624
Thank you.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.558
That'll be 16 even.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.493
Thank you, Roxanne.

09:20.527 --> 09:26.800
Now, this is for Iris,
and this is for you.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.069
Oh, I-- I couldn't
accept this.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.072
Oh, why not, Roxanne?

09:32.105 --> 09:34.274
Because I worked
for you for 11 years,

09:34.307 --> 09:35.709
so I already have $0.50.

09:35.743 --> 09:39.346
Cent

09:39.379 --> 09:40.748
[chuckling]

09:40.781 --> 09:42.916
Of course you do.

09:42.950 --> 09:43.751
Say goodbye, Jacques.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.624
So how do you
like the job so far?

09:50.658 --> 09:52.192
Well, it's just
like being home.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.495
I-- I sweep, I answer
phones, and I do laundry.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.198
Roseanne, where
are the clean towels?

09:58.231 --> 10:01.835
And I listen to
children whine.

10:01.869 --> 10:05.238
Uh, top cabinet, left side.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.507
We think you're
doing a great job.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.010
Well, I appreciate
that, but the truth

10:10.043 --> 10:13.513
is that I could come in
here for just half a day

10:13.546 --> 10:15.148
and get all this stuff done.

10:15.182 --> 10:19.352
Arthur likes having
someone full time.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.790
Marsha, Arthur's dead.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.492
MARSHA: Well, what would
you say to a promotion?

10:25.525 --> 10:28.395
Well, I'd have to say
no because I don't think

10:28.428 --> 10:29.462
I'm going to keep this job.

10:29.496 --> 10:32.632
It means $2 more
an hour, plus tips.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.901
Tips for what?

10:33.934 --> 10:34.935
Shampooing heads.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
Can you do that?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.139
Yeah, I can do that.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.373
I can do anything.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.208
I'm a Conway.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.547
[music playing]

10:49.950 --> 10:51.218
Susan Noonan said
that her mother

10:51.251 --> 10:53.987
saw you sweeping up people's
hair in the beauty parlor.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.023
Well, you tell
Susan Noonan that I

10:56.056 --> 10:58.692
saw her mom getting
her roots bleached

10:58.726 --> 11:02.229
and her mustache waxed.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.832
Hey, Becky, your
mother's got a job, OK?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.399
She's doing the best she can.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.802
Are you wearing perfume?

11:08.836 --> 11:09.703
Yeah.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.906
I bought it after work.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.975
Tres chic.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.944
Perfume?

11:16.977 --> 11:17.911
Yeah.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.948
You know, I figured
I deserved it.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.549
Well, sure you do, babe.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.918
Hey, whatever gets
you through the day.

11:24.952 --> 11:25.819
Actually, I--

11:25.853 --> 11:28.956
I was kind of celebrating.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.958
I got a promotion.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.259
Promotion?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.693
Promotion to what, shampoo girl?

11:38.565 --> 11:39.466
What?

11:39.499 --> 11:40.400
Nothing.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.368
What?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.602
Never mind.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.436
What?

11:45.773 --> 11:46.639
I'm just wrong.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.608
That's all, honey.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.677
I kind of expected you
would be supportive.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.646
I was wrong.
- Oh, OK.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.482
I'm-- I'm sorry.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.583
What kind of
promotion did you get?

12:02.355 --> 12:03.256
Shampoo woman.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.929
- I stand corrected.
- You're a dead man.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.767
Congratulations.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.203
Good going, Mom.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.370
Thanks, Deej.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.738
Yeah, that's great, honey.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.541
Far cry from sweeping hair, huh?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.977
I still do that.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.980
So is there a raise
involved with this promotion?

12:27.014 --> 12:31.518
Yes, but you know, it's not
supposed to be about the money.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.685
It's kind of a--

12:32.719 --> 12:36.756
it's kind of a prestige thing.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.325
Right.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.294
I mean, because you know,
people kind of look up to you

12:41.328 --> 12:43.831
when you're shampooing them.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.232
They have no choice.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.404
Hey, it's a job, right?

12:51.438 --> 12:52.906
- It's a good job.
- That's what I said.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.341
It's a good job.
- No, you didn't.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.242
You said, "Hey.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.677
It's a job, right?"

12:57.710 --> 13:00.213
I meant to say
it's a good job.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.048
Good job.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.485
No, it's not.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.354
It's-- it's not a good job.

13:07.387 --> 13:13.393
It's a degrading job, but nobody
there makes me feel like it is.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.227
That's your job.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.637
Nice going, DJ.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.507
[music playing]

13:35.548 --> 13:37.851
Hey, Roseanne.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.086
I'm really sorry.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.455
I didn't know you
liked this job.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.425
Oh, I don't like this job.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.660
You liked this job a
minute ago in the kitchen.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.963
Well, I don't even
know what I like.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.332
I mean, I like the people.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.700
I mean, I guess I like them.

13:53.733 --> 13:54.935
I don't really know
them or nothing.

13:54.968 --> 13:59.739
But I-- I like them,
and they like me,

13:59.772 --> 14:02.409
and that just makes
sweeping up hair not so bad.

14:05.012 --> 14:09.049
I mean, I know it's a
completely degrading job, but--

14:09.082 --> 14:10.783
but I feel happy, you know?

14:10.817 --> 14:15.755
Um, there's just something about
knowing where I'm going when

14:15.788 --> 14:17.557
I get up in the morning and--

14:17.590 --> 14:19.326
and liking the people
that I work with

14:19.359 --> 14:25.065
and knowing that I maybe might
go back there again tomorrow

14:25.098 --> 14:26.934
and knowing that they want me.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.505
I mean, I'm happy.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.442
So what's the secret, babe?

14:35.475 --> 14:39.179
Lower standards?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.614
Well, I just don't think my
standards could get any lower

14:41.648 --> 14:43.650
than you, and I married you.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.453
[shouting]

14:49.056 --> 14:51.925
You know, Roseanne, I never
imagined in my whole life

14:51.959 --> 14:53.760
that I'd have you
washing my hair.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.695
Well, I always thought
about holding your head

14:55.728 --> 14:58.665
underwater more than once.
OK.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.200
Go ahead and sit up.

15:03.036 --> 15:03.903
OK.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.438
Yeah, Marsha's ready for you.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.013
Crystal, what are you doing?

15:13.046 --> 15:16.049
It's a tip.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.750
You don't have to do that.

15:17.784 --> 15:18.851
But I want to, Roseanne.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.288
If it was anybody
else, I'd tip them.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.923
$10?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.493
Well, just keep
it, Roseanne, OK?

15:26.526 --> 15:27.927
But let me ask you,
something, Crystal.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.864
Are-- are you going to come in
here every week and do this?

15:31.898 --> 15:34.834
Well, I just might.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.270
Well, let's make you
another appointment.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.277
Crystal, I really
want to thank you

15:44.311 --> 15:46.146
for helping me get this job.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.215
Well, that's what
friends are for,

15:48.248 --> 15:50.683
Roseanne, to be
there for each other.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.386
Think of all the things
you've done for me.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.257
And you think $10
is going to even it?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.726
You silly.

15:59.759 --> 16:00.627
Let's go sit down.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.794
Marsha's crazy about you.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.196
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.264
Everybody here loves you.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.265
She told me.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.566
I'm just so proud
of you, Roseanne.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.639
Crystal, I just want
to tell you, you--

16:12.672 --> 16:15.075
you're-- you're my best friend.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.376
Well, no I'm not, either.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.544
Your sister is, but--

16:17.577 --> 16:20.413
All right, all
right, all right.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.083
Now, Iris, I love
what you did last week,

16:23.116 --> 16:24.551
but I want to try
something different.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.355
Can-- can you make
me look like that?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.922
Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.

16:29.956 --> 16:30.790
I'll go get the wand.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.732
Crystal, how are
you doing, honey?

16:39.766 --> 16:41.634
I'm sorry you had to wait.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.503
Marsha, I'm going to go
over to the coffee shop

16:43.536 --> 16:45.238
and pick up the lunches now.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.208
Arthur always says
lunch is the second-most

16:48.241 --> 16:51.444
important meal of the day.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.713
Uh-huh.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.116
Uh, Dan's coming by with
my kids because Iris

16:56.149 --> 16:57.917
is gonna cut their hair for me.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.619
I'll see you.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.720
Wait'll you meet Dan.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.954
He's real nice.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.557
He's just like a great,
big, old teddy bear.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.726
Hey, Crystal, I
tried that natural clay

17:06.759 --> 17:08.528
facial mask sample you gave me.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.429
Uh-huh.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.830
That stuff works.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.764
What'd I tell you?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.234
My skin feels
so creamy smooth,

17:14.267 --> 17:18.004
and it gets all the gunk out
of those little clogged pores.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.939
I need to find a new deodorant.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.675
I'm getting all this chaffing.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.344
Hi, Dan.
DAN: Hi, Crystal.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.345
Is Roseanne around?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.479
She'll be right back.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.380
Hi.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.581
I'm Marsha.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.717
Dan has great skin.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.618
Hi, Marsha.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.386
I heard a lot about you.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.821
Oh, that must be Arthur.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.493
[knocking noise]

17:41.794 --> 17:42.929
IRIS: Hey, kids, I'm going
to be a couple minutes,

17:42.962 --> 17:46.199
so why don't you guys
tear the place apart?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.034
I don't think you
know what you're saying.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.136
You don't have
to stick around.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.337
We'll keep an eye on the kids.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.271
Well, yeah, I--

17:51.304 --> 17:53.873
I kind of better
wait for Roseanne.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.375
Are you Roseanne's husband?
This

17:55.408 --> 17:56.276
Yes, ma'am.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.978
Oh, he's cute.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.948
He's-- he's very cute.

18:01.981 --> 18:02.915
Yeah.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.251
But you need to lose
a little weight.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.021
You're so handsome.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.022
Don't you think he's handsome?

18:12.859 --> 18:16.296
My nephew in Baltimore just
lost 60 pounds on that cottage

18:16.329 --> 18:17.530
cheese and banana diet.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.966
Oh, that doesn't
sound very healthy.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.169
Well, I'm gonna go next
door to the hardware store.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.536
Uh, just tell Rosie
I'll be back--

18:23.570 --> 18:24.437
Sit down.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.938
She'll be back in two minutes.

18:29.876 --> 18:30.677
Thank you.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.028
You know, if you cut your
hair shorter in the front

18:49.061 --> 18:51.764
and let it grow a
little in the back,

18:51.798 --> 18:52.832
your neck would look longer.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.777
I'm going to go to
the hardware store.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.112
[knocking]

19:06.145 --> 19:07.614
It's not hot enough.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.082
That's because it's not on.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.384
Oh!

19:11.418 --> 19:14.721
I was right then.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.557
[music playing]

19:20.560 --> 19:23.463
You know, your little
boy looks just like you.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.266
ALL: Yeah, it's the hair.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.967
No, I think it's the eyes.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.902
He has very dark eyes.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.071
You got sweet kids, Rosie.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.673
Is it OK if I call you Rosie?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.376
Yeah, Dan calls me Rosie.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.977
Arthur used to call me Cheryl.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.118
Not that it's any of
my business, Marsha,

19:46.152 --> 19:49.822
but how long were you
and Arthur married?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.524
11 months.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.726
Too bad you weren't
married to him longer.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.530
Maybe you wouldn't
have missed him so bad.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.632
We ready to close up here?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.334
My first client
isn't until noon,

20:01.368 --> 20:03.002
so I'm going to come in late.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.705
I think I'm going to run
a bigger ad this weekend.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.906
What do you think?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.308
That's a good idea.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.477
You know what I
think is a good idea?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.879
You ought to run an ad in one
of those high school newspapers,

20:12.912 --> 20:13.780
you know?

20:13.813 --> 20:17.350
A lot of those girls have hair.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.751
That's a great idea.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.587
Isn't that a great idea?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.854
Yeah, it's a great idea.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.823
I'll call in the morning.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.727
Roseanne, have you made up
your mind about this job yet?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.129
Yeah, I hate it.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.864
Well, of course
you hate it, honey,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.233
but are you going
to stay with us?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.435
Yeah.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.636
Yeah.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.338
I am.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.972
But I hope it doesn't get
any better, because then

Yeah.

I'll be here.

- Buh-bye.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.484
Bye.
