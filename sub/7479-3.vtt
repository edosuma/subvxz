WEBVTT

00:15.016 --> 00:17.211
Tango-One, this is Echo-Six.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.285
We're approaching
Checkpoint Delta, over.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.421
Copy that, Echo-Six.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.417
Walker, pull up on the bluff ahead.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.857
Oh, nicely done, Walker.

00:31.032 --> 00:33.330
You hit every big rock
for the last six miles.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.331
Seriously, man.
Who taught you how to drive?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.197
The same person
that taught me about sex.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.531
Your mom.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.435
Hastings,
explain to this fool what happens

00:40.608 --> 00:43.839
when someone brings my mama
into the conversation.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.941
- Hastings...
- Shh.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.343
- I saw something.
- Where?

00:48.516 --> 00:50.347
What is it? What do you see?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.610
Bingo.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.188
Got a bogey at 2 o'clock,
maybe 50 meters out.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.722
U.S. Marines.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.360
- Who goes there?
- We got a runner.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.859
Hastings, Walker. Cut him off.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.021
Mintoya, with me.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.603
Move in, Mintoya. On the ridge.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.034
Tango-One, Echo-Six

01:13.207 --> 01:15.698
in pursuit of a runner heading
southeast of Checkpoint Delta.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.036
Roger that.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.472
Ambush! Ambush!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.239
- Reed! Reed!
- I'm hit!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.941
Reed's down!

01:25.119 --> 01:28.088
Taking fire from multiple shooters

01:28.255 --> 01:29.779
southeast of our position.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.584
Humvee's been disabled by an IED.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.992
Hastings! Walker!

02:32.686 --> 02:35.382
Deeks, what are you doing?

02:35.556 --> 02:37.786
Coming off
a little L.A.P.D. Undercover field trip.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.022
How about a ride?

02:41.529 --> 02:44.020
Oh, my God. Is that you?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.397
What? I'm Method when I go under.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.558
That's disgusting.
That's really disgusting.

02:48.736 --> 02:52.172
You can't be a homeless person if you
smell like you stepped out of a spa.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.638
So I never wash these clothes
so they keep their authenticity.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.901
That's great.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.375
I wouldn't let you ride in my trunk
smelling like that.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.377
No, no. No, no. Come on. Come on.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.743
- Bye, Deeks.
- Kensi.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.147
Thanks, partner.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.378
Here, buddy.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.647
Oh, really? A quarter?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.256
A quarter?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.331
Look. I'm all for going green,
reducing our footprint.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.990
If Hetty has her way,
we're gonna be reusing our bullets.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.366
She just wants us to recover our brass
if possible.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.201
Reusable water bottles,
no more paper towels,

03:28.375 --> 03:29.603
no more paper cups.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.972
What's next to go, huh?

03:33.047 --> 03:35.982
- We're saving the planet, G.
- Come on.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.277
Don't come to me when she replaces
our toilet paper with used Post-its.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.715
- You hear me?
- Heh. Yeah.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.609
He's back,
and this time it's personal.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.044
What do you think
Dr. Freud would say about this, Sam?

04:09.617 --> 04:12.211
Obvious phallic obsession
and anger towards his mother.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.512
Heh. Just getting a little practice in.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.750
Does it have anything to do with
the assignment Hetty sent you on?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.892
Doesn't everything we do
come back to Hetty?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.221
Where you been?
Hetty won't tell us a thing.

04:23.731 --> 04:28.964
Well, if you wanna grab a beer later,
I'll tell you all about it.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.604
I've gotta go check in with her.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.463
It's good seeing you guys.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.504
That was weird.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.736
Even for Nate.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.414
One thing's for certain,

04:45.586 --> 04:47.918
someone's been giving him
shooting lessons.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.955
I think there's something wrong
with your hot water heater.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.087
The, uh, showers are on timers,
Mr. Deeks.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.197
You obviously exceeded
the recommended duration.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.457
You might wanna make an exception
in his case.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.760
Really needs it.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.563
For your information, I won
the Hygiene Award in high school.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.763
What kind of school rewards you
for bathing?

05:07.341 --> 05:09.434
I don't know, man.
A sparkly clean one?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.945
Ah, gentlemen.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.477
Eric.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.080
This just in.

05:15.282 --> 05:18.376
All of this footage was shot with helmet
or dashboard mounted cameras.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.018
Four Marines were ambushed.

05:20.187 --> 05:23.281
One escaped, three are still missing.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.117
This doesn't look like Afghanistan.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.793
It's not.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.953
It was recorded just after sunrise
outside of San Diego

05:31.131 --> 05:33.565
on the California-Mexican border.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.065
The Marines were assisting ICE

05:35.235 --> 05:38.068
and Customs and Border patrol
in securing the area.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.832
Now, the fear is that
the Marines either stumbled across

05:41.008 --> 05:44.409
or were specifically targeted
by one of the Mexican cartels

05:44.645 --> 05:47.842
that use the area
to smuggle people, guns, drugs.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.481
Anyone claim responsibility?

05:49.683 --> 05:52.311
Not yet.
We don't even have a definitive motive.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.679
I can think of a few.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.515
Payback, leverage,
prisoner exchange.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.623
You said
one of the Marines escaped?

05:57.825 --> 05:59.349
That would be Corporal Allen Reed.

05:59.827 --> 06:03.319
Lance Corporal Edward Mintoya,
Lance Corporal Shelly Hastings,

06:03.497 --> 06:07.365
and PFC Liam Walker
are still missing.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.732
Since we have ongoing cases
and intimate knowledge of the cartels,

06:11.939 --> 06:14.169
Director Vance
has asked us to get involved

06:14.341 --> 06:15.899
and help to the best of our abilities.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.839
Time is of the essence, Mr. Callen.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.776
Kensi, Deeks, check out the crime
scene. See what you can find out.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.347
Sam and I
will question the Marine that escaped.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.111
We'll also hit our street contacts
who have cartel connections.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.948
See if we can find out
who's behind this.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.250
Um, listen. Uh, can we hold on
a second here, guys?

06:32.426 --> 06:35.054
Here's the thing.
I'm more of a city mouse, yeah?

06:35.229 --> 06:37.129
So maybe we should send
the former Navy SEAL

06:37.297 --> 06:39.390
out into the desert with Kensi, yeah?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.261
It will be good experience for you,
Deeks.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.562
Right, and I'm all for good experiences,
it's just

06:43.737 --> 06:46.865
I don't know if you've noticed or not,
but I've got this ivory complexion,

06:47.074 --> 06:49.440
kind of fair skin,
tend to burn kind of easily

06:49.676 --> 06:51.405
whereas, you know, Sam here...

06:51.945 --> 06:52.969
Well, Sam...

06:55.082 --> 06:59.041
I'm just saying that Sam is clearly
better suited for a tropical climate.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.383
Do tell.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.588
Well, I mean, for starters,

07:03.757 --> 07:07.056
you've got the whole bald-head thing
going on, which is awesome.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.458
And it's gotta be better for,
you know, heat exchange.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.566
Um, and I don't wanna have to
overstate the obvious here,

07:13.734 --> 07:16.567
but you are African-American, yeah?

07:16.737 --> 07:21.003
And Africa is hot.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.134
I'm from Brooklyn, Huckleberry.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.470
Brooklyn.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.244
- Right.
- And we're good.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.747
We will call you guys
if we find anything.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.115
- I meant because I'm...
- No, you are done.

07:33.287 --> 07:37.087
- Norwegian-American.
- One of these days, I'm gonna kill him.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.682
Maybe he grows on you.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.451
So does ringworm.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.373
- Over that way, ma'am.
- Thanks.

08:03.784 --> 08:07.515
Major Orley,
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.985
This is our L.A.P.D. Liaison Officer,
Detective Marty Deeks.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.351
What are we looking at here?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.460
An ambush.
They were close when they hit them.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.356
- The Marine who survived?
- Corporal Reed.

08:16.563 --> 08:19.054
Suffered some minor injuries.
Nothing serious.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.394
He was patched up at the base hospital
before heading to you for questioning.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.366
He doesn't remember
much of anything.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.165
The guy doesn't remember
anything?

08:26.373 --> 08:28.000
You ever been in a firefight,
detective?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.034
- One or two.
- You remember your first one?

08:32.312 --> 08:34.177
Major, we've got something.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.650
We've got one
about half a klick east of you, sir.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.527
It's Corporal Mintoya.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.707
Damn it.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.316
"Now to you we bring the war."

09:24.831 --> 09:26.924
I've got my men working
a hundred yard swath

09:27.100 --> 09:28.624
with Border Patrol
in both directions.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.099
My guess is the cartel's gonna
smuggle them into Mexico

09:31.304 --> 09:32.965
if they haven't already done so.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.266
I'm not so sure, major.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.568
Found SUV tracks
heading in the other direction.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.109
I'm pretty sure they're heading away
from Mexico.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.439
If you'll excuse me.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.311
Did I just get blown off?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.452
Like Ronald McDonald
at a PETA convention.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.178
How certain are you
about your tracks?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.186
- I'd bet your life on it.
- Awesome.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.951
Looks like somebody was being
dragged, which fits the scenario.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.358
You ready to go for a little ride?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.025
On the bikes, Deeks. On the bikes.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.760
I didn't say anything.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.938
Eric, check the archives of
satellite images for the ambush area.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.371
Go back at least a month. Whoever did
this has been planning it for some time.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.772
Check with the other agencies.
See if anybody's picked up any chatter.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.607
They've already been contacted.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.442
Call if you find anything.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.777
Corporal Reed has been given
a clean bill of health.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.386
He's waiting for you at the boatshed
with Nate.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.953
We ran into Nate.
He seemed kind of distant.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.955
Probably just jet lag.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.650
Yeah, we didn't realize
that he'd just gotten back from...

10:28.862 --> 10:30.887
Oh, his assignment, yes.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.530
Which was where again, exactly?

10:32.999 --> 10:36.867
He was in the People's Republic
of None-of-Your-Damn-Business.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.737
That where he learned
how to shoot?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.875
Actually, I gave him a few pointers.

10:43.109 --> 10:45.577
Apparently the People's Republic
of None-of-Your-Damn-Business

10:45.745 --> 10:47.042
can be a dangerous place.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.270
Why are we stopping?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.745
I lost the trail.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.350
- We're lost?
- Oh, relax, nancy.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.746
Oh, you know what?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.889
I'm surprised you got us this far
and I just wanna say nice job.

11:30.090 --> 11:34.151
But if we head back now,
we can beat traffic.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.896
What? Listen,
we've got to face the facts here.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.429
We only have so much gas
and water

11:39.599 --> 11:40.930
and this is the frigging desert.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.934
Hey, Deeks,
we're not in the middle of the Sahara.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.595
Even if we were, my dad taught me
how to survive anywhere

11:46.773 --> 11:48.764
including the desert.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.705
Got them.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.206
They're heading west. See?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.783
An SUV riding low
with a chunk out of the rear right tire.

11:59.986 --> 12:03.080
Wow, nice work, Tonto.
Your dad teach you how to track too?

12:03.256 --> 12:07.420
Track, shoot, fix an engine, play poker,
wire a house.

12:07.627 --> 12:11.586
Basically anything you'd teach a son,
only he didn't have a son, just me.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.791
- So you guys were close then?
- Very. Best friends.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.960
- What about you and your dad?
- Yeah, not so much.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.799
In fact, I'm pretty sure he hates me.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.701
Why would you say that?

12:21.908 --> 12:25.742
Because the last time I saw him
he said, "Marty, I hate you."

12:26.913 --> 12:31.145
Well, even people who love us say
things in anger they don't really mean.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.785
Uh-huh. Then he fired a shotgun
at me. Heh, heh.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.922
Man, I hate Thanksgiving.
Although that was six years ago.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.957
The miserable bastard
could be dead by now.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.426
- I gotta pee.
- Again?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.430
I hydrated for the desert.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.624
All this bouncing around
is hard on my kidneys.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.100
Hurry up, okay?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.863
- Don't peek.
- No.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.809
Deeks.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.051
It's okay, it was just a...
It was a rattlesnake.

13:07.253 --> 13:09.312
It was getting ready to pounce.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.814
Snakes don't pounce, they strike.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.756
This one looked like a pouncer.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.558
Listen, I'm sorry about that
but when I was a little kid,

13:19.799 --> 13:21.630
my friend
Darrel Donkins' boa constrictor

13:21.801 --> 13:25.202
tried to strangle me to death
at his eighth-grade birthday party.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.669
Darrell's or the snake's?

13:26.873 --> 13:29.569
See, you think it's funny
but it's not funny, all right?

13:29.776 --> 13:32.142
Paramedics had to use
the Jaws of Life to set me free me.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.041
Made the front page
of the Encino Times.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.513
My mom still has a copy laminated
on the front of her fridge.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.379
- Deeks?
- Yeah?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.520
Your fly's open.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.816
Son of a...

13:44.024 --> 13:45.821
I shouted for the figure
to show himself,

13:45.992 --> 13:47.857
but he took off running.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.725
The next thing I know
we're taking fire from all directions.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.360
I think the blast from the IED
must have knocked me unconscious

13:55.535 --> 13:57.696
because I think I blacked out.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.540
When I came to, the Humvee was
destroyed and everybody was gone.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.610
Not everyone.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.913
Mintoya was found this morning.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.114
He's dead, sir?

14:14.921 --> 14:17.082
I'm afraid so.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.451
Hastings and Walker

14:22.128 --> 14:23.356
are still missing.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.557
- Did you find any of our attackers?
- Not yet.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.759
I swore I got one
with a head shot, sir.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.698
Mintoya was killed with a head shot.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.042
You think I did this?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.435
Did you?

14:41.648 --> 14:43.445
Yes, sir.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.415
I led them into the ambush.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.553
I was in charge.
That makes me responsible, sir.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.655
They should have took me
instead of Hastings.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.086
- I know it's hard.
- You have to find her.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.853
"Her"?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.928
Don't you mean "them"?

15:00.467 --> 15:02.799
You're worried about Hastings
because she's a woman?

15:02.969 --> 15:03.993
Hell no, sir.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.831
She's tougher than Walker
and smarter too.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.666
I'd rather have her
watch my 6 any day.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.501
Then what?

15:11.444 --> 15:14.811
Reed, they're in trouble.

15:16.182 --> 15:19.151
Fellow Marines, your buddies.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.319
Anything you can tell us,

15:21.521 --> 15:26.185
no matter how seemingly insignificant,
can help us.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.931
Is there something else
we should know about?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.669
Hastings is pregnant.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.872
She just found out this morning.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.600
She didn't tell me until we were about
to end our patrol.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.471
No one else in the unit even knows.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.342
Are you the father?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.344
No, sir.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.676
Mintoya was.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.754
Two Marines are missing,

16:04.931 --> 16:06.831
one of whom
was supposedly pregnant,

16:06.999 --> 16:09.024
and the father of her unborn child
is dead.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.261
- You think he's lying?
- What's the more likely scenario?

16:12.505 --> 16:15.440
Mexican drug cartel
ambushes four Marines,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.768
killing one and kidnapping
the other two,

16:18.010 --> 16:20.444
or a love triangle between
fellow Marines leads to murder?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.944
- Where are the bodies?
- He could have buried them.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.412
Okay, if Reed did do this,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.678
why wouldn't he just
shoot Hastings and Walker

16:27.854 --> 16:29.719
and say they died in the firefight?

16:29.922 --> 16:33.414
Well, not being able to find the bodies
lends credence to the kidnapping story

16:33.659 --> 16:36.685
and it takes the suspicions off of Reed
for being the lone survivor.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.160
I don't know.
He seems genuinely traumatized.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.766
Like a guy who was in a firefight
or a guy who killed three Marines?

16:51.911 --> 16:54.379
- Kensi.
- Find anything?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.708
I'm not even sure
we're going in the right direction.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.942
- You?
- Nothing yet.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.382
We're gonna go find our favorite
snitch J.J., see what he knows.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.385
- Good luck with that.
- How's Deeks?

17:05.057 --> 17:06.115
Pees a lot.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.952
Let us know if you find anything.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.824
Likewise.

17:21.140 --> 17:24.075
What's the difference
between tar pit and quicksand?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.301
One's tar and the other one's sand?

17:26.479 --> 17:29.505
So how come you never
hear about quicksand anymore?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.114
- What are you talking about?
- It used to be everywhere.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.344
Tarzan, Gilligan,
even the Six Million Dollar Man

17:34.520 --> 17:36.488
used to get caught in it
sooner or later.

17:36.647 --> 17:38.512
Is this what you do
when people are sleeping?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.988
- You're up thinking about quicksand?
- Smoke weed?

17:41.627 --> 17:42.855
Got three for 15.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.926
Welcome to the tar pits,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.724
You smoke weed, man?

17:47.133 --> 17:48.532
Got three for 15.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.293
Yeah, for eight. You smoke?

17:51.838 --> 17:54.102
Fifteen bucks.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.264
Yo, J.J.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.174
Don't run.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.291
I clearly said, don't run.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.552
He did.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.023
I think I broke my back.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.128
It's impossible.
You'd have to have a spine.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.392
A Mexican cartel may have
kidnapped Marines along the border.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.899
- What do you know about it?
- Nothing.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.972
- I swear. I'm legit now.
- Mm-hm.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.007
I'll bet these
medical marijuana cards aren't.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.206
J.J., I need a name.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.782
No?

18:40.052 --> 18:42.486
Okay. Throw him in the tar pit.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.654
You wouldn't do that.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.290
I wouldn't. He might.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.888
In fact, he would.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.659
Okay, okay, okay.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.425
I got a name.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.995
Emilio Ortega.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.762
Nice try.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.998
Ortega and his bodyguard
got blown up last week.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.198
That's right.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.243
And when he got killed, everybody
started scrambling to fill his spot.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.576
Only one guy is coming out on top.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.207
Torres.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.451
- Memo Torres?
- No, Shecky Torres.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.851
Of course Memo Torres.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.617
You didn't hear it from me.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.925
I catch you selling anything
on the street but Star Maps,

19:23.095 --> 19:26.895
I'm not even calling L.A.P.D.
I will run you over with my car.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.693
- You understand?
- Yeah.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.698
- Get the hell out of here.
- Okay.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.962
- Okay, man.
- Move it.

19:32.138 --> 19:35.232
Okay, I'm moving. I'm moving.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.603
What the hell is Memo Torres
doing kidnapping Marines?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.247
Maybe he's flexing his muscle.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.385
Show the other cartels
how badass he is.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.781
I wish there was another way
to do this.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.118
You and me both.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.787
Nate, I read your report
on Corporal Reed.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.957
- How's he doing?
- He's afraid.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.069
For his fellow Marines?

20:05.237 --> 20:07.000
For himself.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.905
I don't follow.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.108
There are worse things than death
for a Marine.

20:16.315 --> 20:19.443
So he's questioning his actions.

20:19.619 --> 20:23.385
I suppose we all must
from time to time.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.653
People worry too much
about making the wrong choices,

20:26.826 --> 20:32.093
when what they should
really worry about is not making any.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.262
You could at least try
to be a little more subtle, Hetty.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.301
I am a psychologist, remember?

20:40.406 --> 20:43.432
Yes, and a good one at that.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.435
Is patronizing me
part of your plan too?

20:47.613 --> 20:49.342
Is that what you think?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.540
You can't answer my question
with a question.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.276
- According to whose rules?
- That's another question.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.719
More a query for clarification,
don't you think?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.856
That's still a question.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.288
Clearly you need more time.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.157
Yes.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.226
Yes, you need more time?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.132
No.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.436
Yes, I wanna go back.

21:25.551 --> 21:29.078
That's not a decision
to be made lightly.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.387
Have you told the others?

21:31.590 --> 21:33.182
No.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.190
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't say anything

21:35.361 --> 21:38.091
until I've had a chance to speak
with them myself.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.576
- What are you doing?
- I need to activate a former alias.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.415
Oh, no. NLV. NLV.

22:03.589 --> 22:09.425
"No longer viable."
Tyrell Ellis was compromised.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.188
I know.
I was Tyrell Ellis, remember?

22:12.398 --> 22:13.729
I do remember.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.699
I also remember you were nearly killed
before we got you out.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.495
My cover was never blown.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.573
I spent seven months undercover
working Memo Torres

22:23.743 --> 22:26.109
while he was still a cartel underling.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.404
Now he's the man.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.916
That means he's the fastest route
to finding those missing Marines.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.580
And the only one who can get
to Torres right now is in this box.

22:35.788 --> 22:39.781
The man in this box
has a price on his head.

22:39.959 --> 22:45.158
- Why don't you just arrest Torres?
- We don't have anything on him.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.593
We yank him in off the streets

22:46.766 --> 22:49.735
and we blow any chance of ever
going back under in his organization.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.132
Plus, Memo hates cops of any kind.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.273
He'll be lawyered up
as soon as we bring him in

22:55.441 --> 22:57.739
and we may never find those
missing Marines, Hetty.

22:58.911 --> 23:03.610
Oh, Mr. Callen, could you please talk
some sense to your partner?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.774
What, like that's ever worked?

23:06.318 --> 23:12.052
Admittedly, putting Sam on the streets
as Tyrell Ellis is not without risks.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.825
Memo Torres is behind this.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.689
Reactivating Tyrell Ellis
is the only way to find him.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.956
It's our only bet, Hetty,
and you know it.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.135
I don't like it.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.815
You're gonna play this one cool,
right?

23:40.986 --> 23:42.146
Yep.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.390
What's the safe word?

23:51.197 --> 23:52.721
Headlock.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.300
Really?

23:56.235 --> 23:57.896
How do you use headlock
in a sentence?

23:58.504 --> 24:00.631
I wasn't planning on using it.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.212
- Yo.
- Eric.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.251
- Yeah.
- I'm sending some photos to you.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.880
I need you to identify the players.
Also, check the cameras in the area.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.391
Wanna know who's been coming out
of here last two months.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.925
You got it, G. I'm on it.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.687
Thanks.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.014
Tyrell Ellis.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.446
Rumor is you're the big boss

24:48.654 --> 24:51.054
now that Emilio Ortega
got himself blown up.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.691
- I heard another rumor.
- Yeah?

24:53.893 --> 24:57.454
You ratted out Lil Deon and
now he's somebody's girl up in Chino.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.063
You heard wrong. About me.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.223
Wouldn't surprise me with Deon.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.199
I'm just happy to hear he's in
a steady relationship.

25:05.804 --> 25:09.262
How is it that you managed to vanish
right before your boss got pinched?

25:09.942 --> 25:11.933
I'm good like that.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.743
Tyrell Ellis. I'm a survivor, baby.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.812
- I moved my operation to Florida.
- I didn't hear that.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.048
You wasn't supposed to.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.386
You should have stayed down there,

25:28.560 --> 25:29.584
survivor.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.058
I'm not here by choice.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.600
Miami makes L.A.
look like a trailer park.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.738
Unfortunately,
you and I got personal business.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.841
The only business I got with you
is deciding where I'm gonna bury you.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.567
Look, why don't you save
the tough guy routine, Memo.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.804
When you was dealing dime bags
to school kids,

25:48.981 --> 25:51.814
I was putting members of
my new crew in key positions with ICE,

25:51.984 --> 25:53.508
Border Patrol, even the military.

25:53.719 --> 25:57.246
I was this close to establishing a safe
and permanent trade corridor

25:57.423 --> 26:00.449
until you screwed it up
by kidnapping a bunch of Marines.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.484
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.026
Hetty?

26:08.267 --> 26:11.259
Director Vance
would appreciate an update.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.995
He'd appreciate an update
or he asked for an update?

26:14.239 --> 26:17.834
Oh, Mr. Callen, just tell me.
What the hell is going on?

26:18.043 --> 26:20.671
Sam's still talking
to his former contact.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.541
Well, the fact that I haven't
heard anything on the police scanner

26:23.749 --> 26:25.341
indicates he's still alive.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.542
Relax. We're all good, Hetty.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.687
Sam knows he has to play this one
extra cool.

26:32.858 --> 26:35.156
Uh, here he comes.
I'll call you right back.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.351
Mr. Callen.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.667
Would that be considered
a headlock?

26:48.907 --> 26:49.965
Don't even.

26:50.142 --> 26:53.634
You and I have a very different idea
of what playing it cool means.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.548
We should be coming
to an old fire road.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.316
They can follow the 79
and continue north.

27:40.526 --> 27:44.895
Or they can take the 78
and head into Arizona.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.565
Where are they going?

27:48.734 --> 27:51.828
I don't know, but I hope to hell
it's got air conditioning.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.170
I can't believe people do this for fun.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.434
You look rugged, Deeks.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.167
I wouldn't make you
for a four-star hotel camper.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.576
My idea of roughing it
is being at a pool without a cabana.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.649
- Wait, you think I look rugged?
- Yeah.

28:05.851 --> 28:09.844
Like Malibu Ken.
He's not anatomically correct either.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.694
Awesome.

28:24.536 --> 28:30.031
- Naval Criminal what?
- Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

28:30.876 --> 28:35.404
I'm not in the Navy, stupid.
So you gotta let me go.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.546
Our mistake.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.616
Sit down, stupid.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.880
I want my lawyer.
I know my Miranda Rights.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.548
Miranda? Who's Miranda?

28:47.726 --> 28:48.886
Sam, you know any Miranda?

28:49.094 --> 28:52.461
I know a Melinda in Accounting,
redhead, freckles.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.131
Stop jerking me around.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.632
Oh, I'm not jerking you around.
You familiar with the PATRIOT Act?

28:57.836 --> 29:00.327
Of course you're not.
Here's the thing.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.839
What you did was not only murder,
attempted murder and kidnapping,

29:04.009 --> 29:06.443
but because it was against
Marines on active duty,

29:06.645 --> 29:07.976
that's domestic terrorism.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.913
Oops.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.609
I didn't do anything.
I'm a businessman.

29:13.786 --> 29:14.980
I sell rims.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.450
How are you
at making license plates?

29:17.623 --> 29:19.784
Hey, guys.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.489
What about my phone call?
What about my call?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.197
Only thing they found
in Memo's shop

29:26.365 --> 29:29.163
was a couple of unregistered
handguns and some cash.

29:29.335 --> 29:32.634
No drugs, no contraband.
We've got nothing.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.738
Except for where he tried to kill me.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.999
Not to mention
how much he's overcharging for rims.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.770
Eric's still sifting through
the surveillance footage.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.642
These are all the usual suspects,
save for this one.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.613
Donald Wexling of Wexling-Goring.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.344
He's a multimillion-dollar
textile manufacturer.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.886
What does he want with Memo?

29:51.123 --> 29:53.819
Maybe he's getting spinners
for the limo.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.655
- He's got a nasty drug habit?
- Wexling is a patron of the arts.

29:56.829 --> 30:00.026
He sits on a number of boards.
His wife is involved in the charities.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.790
Last thing he's gonna want
is a very public drug conviction.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.163
My bet is that if you lean on Wexling,

30:05.337 --> 30:07.771
he'll give up Memo
to keep this on the down low.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.065
Don't say "down low."

30:10.809 --> 30:12.242
Soon as we have
something on Memo,

30:12.411 --> 30:14.208
we'll twist him for info
on the Marines.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.210
Have Eric find anything he can
on Wexling.

30:16.382 --> 30:19.545
Addresses, bank accounts,
boxers or briefs.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.936
Eric, I think we've got something.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.403
There's our guy.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.903
Mr. Wexling.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.277
Federal agents.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.610
What sort of questions?

30:52.851 --> 30:55.547
Questions about your relationship
with Guillermo Torres.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.066
You know he's a drug dealer
with ties to the Mexican cartels?

30:58.090 --> 30:59.580
Of course.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.720
You do?

31:01.927 --> 31:03.918
If Memo didn't have connections
with the cartels,

31:04.096 --> 31:05.927
I wouldn't be dealing with him,
trust me.

31:06.098 --> 31:09.124
But I have textile manufacturing
and administrative facilities in Mexico

31:09.334 --> 31:11.734
and I need to keep my people
and my assets safe.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.404
You're paying him extortion money?

31:13.605 --> 31:15.732
We call it foreign business dues,
but yes.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.608
Memo handles my protection funds
which prevent my employees

31:18.777 --> 31:21.871
from being kidnapped and my factories
from being burned to the ground.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.276
You realize when a man
of your stature pays Torres,

31:24.450 --> 31:26.475
you're essentially
sanctioning racketeering.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.278
Payoff money is the cost
of doing business south of the border

31:29.455 --> 31:31.980
or anywhere else, for that matter,
this country included.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.091
Our own government
pays off foreign diplomats.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.094
I'm sure the government
will be interested in hearing about

31:37.262 --> 31:38.729
your relationship with Memo Torres.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.797
You mean
my Mexican security advisor?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.932
I didn't build
a multimillion-dollar business

31:44.103 --> 31:45.161
by making stupid mistakes.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.736
If you and the other agencies
weren't losing the drug war,

31:47.906 --> 31:50.136
I wouldn't have to pay off
the damn cartels.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.637
So instead of hassling me,

31:51.810 --> 31:54.904
maybe you two should be doing
something worthwhile.

31:55.681 --> 31:56.739
If you'll excuse me.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.442
If you have any other questions, you
can ask them through my attorneys.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.882
Well, nice enough guy.

32:08.894 --> 32:09.918
Yeah.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.087
Kensi and Deeks found something
35 miles from the Mexican border.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.790
- Patch us through.
- Gonna move in for a closer look.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.435
No, Kensi.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.370
- We've got them.
- They're both injured.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.172
- How many shooters, Kensi?
- I see three.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.313
- They're taking them to the truck.
- Okay.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.984
Eric, we gotta get out of here.
They're moving them out.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.721
- Eric, I need a lift out of here now.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.485
Come on, move it.

32:44.863 --> 32:45.989
You hear that, Quinn?

32:51.837 --> 32:54.237
Thompson, get them
out of here. Evans, with me.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.923
Can't this thing go any faster?

33:49.094 --> 33:50.755
Should have let you drive.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.898
In the truck. Move.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.066
- Who are you?
- NCIS. You guys okay?

34:05.243 --> 34:06.505
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.145
Someone's coming.
Come on, move.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.474
Move. Move, move, move.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.652
Come on, Walker. Get down there.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.463
Deeks.

34:33.638 --> 34:34.661
Deeks.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.174
We've got a problem.

34:41.212 --> 34:43.077
- What kind of problem?
- Thompson's down.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.976
The hostages have escaped.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.710
Go find them. Make sure he's dead.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.178
What the hell happened?

35:18.349 --> 35:20.112
I got jumped from behind.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.482
- Someone's helping them.
- They couldn't have gotten far.

35:25.090 --> 35:27.558
Spread out. Find them.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.610
Behind you!

35:51.950 --> 35:53.577
Did you miss me?

35:53.752 --> 35:55.913
- Where have you been?
- They killed my bike.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.387
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Save your ammo.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.948
Marine.

36:05.063 --> 36:08.521
- Eric, they've got us pinned down.
- Copy that, help is on the way.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.826
How you doing, Marine?

36:12.036 --> 36:13.970
- I'm fine, ma'am.
- He needs a doctor.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.840
What happened to
Mintoya and Reed?

36:18.076 --> 36:19.668
Reed got away.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.675
I'm afraid Mintoya's dead.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.809
I'm really sorry.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.249
Any idea on how to get us
out of here, Tonto?

36:29.420 --> 36:31.354
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.519
Why do I keep seeing the ending

36:33.691 --> 36:35.750
of Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid?

36:36.461 --> 36:39.055
Screw this.
I'm gonna light these bastards up.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.600
Lieutenant, how much longer?

36:46.805 --> 36:48.466
We have a visual in ten mikes, sir.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.505
They may not have ten minutes.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.170
What do you think
they're waiting for?

36:57.382 --> 36:59.282
I don't know.

37:04.989 --> 37:07.150
- They have a grenade launcher.
- What?

37:07.325 --> 37:08.815
They have a grenade launcher?

37:08.993 --> 37:12.121
That's so much worse than the ending
of Butch and Sundance.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.163
- That SUV might be our only chance.
- What if there's no keys in it?

37:19.370 --> 37:20.997
We hotwire it.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.731
Oh, come on. Please don't tell me
you can't hotwire a car.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.706
I'm a cop, all right?
We stop people from doing that.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.176
What? I'm sorry if my father
didn't spend the weekends

37:29.347 --> 37:31.338
teaching me to be Jason Bourne.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.484
All right, you know what?
I'll draw their fire.

37:34.018 --> 37:37.146
- You make a run for the SUV.
- Marines, you ready?

37:37.355 --> 37:38.982
- Oorah, ma'am.
- Oorah.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.054
Deeks.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.805
- Go, go, go!
- Move!

38:36.047 --> 38:37.480
Got your front.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.212
Go!

38:41.719 --> 38:43.346
Shooter.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.622
- Are you okay?
- Oorah, sir.

38:51.462 --> 38:52.793
Clear over here.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.955
- Kensi.
- I'm good.

38:55.733 --> 38:58.827
- Sam.
- We're good.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.433
Hold up.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.801
I'm good too.
Just in case anybody cares.

39:07.912 --> 39:09.106
Call it, we're clear.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.314
Easy.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.920
- Well done, Marine.
- Thank you, sir.

39:30.501 --> 39:33.368
These guys
look like cartel members to you?

39:33.538 --> 39:36.530
- They look like mercs.
- Check the last number dialed.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.035
Donald Wexling.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.941
Who's Donald Wexling?

39:44.115 --> 39:46.242
He's the man that paid for all this.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.983
What's that? Why am I even here?

39:54.192 --> 39:57.684
It's a satellite phone with several
saved messages from you.

39:57.895 --> 40:01.194
Found it on one of your mercenaries
that you hired to kidnap the Marines.

40:01.366 --> 40:03.834
I would like my attorney
to be present.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.299
Just one?

40:05.503 --> 40:07.334
You're gonna need a whole team.

40:07.505 --> 40:10.804
We've got proof you paid to have
U.S. Marines kidnapped and killed.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.003
So, what was the plan, Mr. Wexling?

40:13.978 --> 40:16.845
Suck the U.S. Military into a war
with the Mexican drug cartel

40:17.015 --> 40:19.882
just to try and solve your business
problems south of the border?

40:21.652 --> 40:25.486
We go into Afghanistan,
we go into Iraq to weed out terrorists,

40:25.656 --> 40:29.990
and yet we let them run rampant
in our own backyard.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.919
Explain that to me.

40:33.798 --> 40:36.733
We're not political analysts,
Mr. Wexling.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.563
We just arrest the bad guys.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.573
- And that is everything.
- Oh.

40:50.048 --> 40:53.381
- What's in the box?
- Uh, junk, mostly.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.348
My coffee mugs, some books.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.180
Perhaps you should leave them
with me.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.551
I can take care of it until you return.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.052
The others will be back soon.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.127
I've still got some packing to do,

41:08.332 --> 41:10.960
some things to square away
in my apartment.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.536
Besides, it's not like
I'm never gonna see them again, right?

41:18.209 --> 41:22.942
This is my chance to make a real
difference and do my part over there.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.783
I just wanna thank you

41:28.219 --> 41:31.279
for all the opportunities
you've given me

41:31.589 --> 41:33.079
and all the things you've taught me.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.761
You're an important part of this team
and you always will be.

41:53.277 --> 41:56.269
Come here. Take care of yourself.

41:56.481 --> 42:00.315
Trust your instincts.
They've brought you this far.

42:02.386 --> 42:07.119
Keep your wits sharp, your heart open,
and your gun loaded.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.155
I will.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.189
Goodbye, Hetty.

42:17.268 --> 42:20.032
Until the next time, Mr. Getz.

42:23.908 --> 42:26.342
Used to know
this guy named Shaba.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.034
He's got a food truck
in Zarnegar Park

42:28.212 --> 42:30.339
across from the tomb
of Abdur Rahman Khan.

42:31.782 --> 42:32.840
The kabobs suck,

42:33.851 --> 42:37.844
but Shaba can get you
just about anything you need.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.550
Just tell him you're a friend of Yurik.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.422
Yurik?

42:44.729 --> 42:46.697
It sounded cool at the time.
