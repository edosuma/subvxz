<i>New York,</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:05.303
<i>the city of</i>
<i>a million stories.</i>

00:05.305 --> 00:08.606
<i>Half of them are true.</i>
<i>The other half?</i>

00:08.608 --> 00:12.042
<i>Just haven't</i>
<i>happened yet.</i>

00:14.279 --> 00:16.480
<i>Statues,</i>

00:16.482 --> 00:17.682
<i>the man said.</i>

00:20.887 --> 00:23.121
<i>Living statues</i>
<i>that moved in the dark.</i>

00:31.731 --> 00:36.068
So, will you take
the case, Mr. Garner?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.736
Sure. Why not?

00:37.738 --> 00:39.838
Because you don't
believe me.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.806
For $25 a day,
plus expenses,

00:41.808 --> 00:44.208
I'll believe any damn
thing you like.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.544
But you don't believe
that statues can move.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.315
And you're
right, Mr. Garner,

00:51.317 --> 00:53.416
they can't.

00:53.418 --> 00:56.085
Of course
they can't.

00:58.989 --> 01:00.357
When you're looking.

01:02.526 --> 01:05.462
Goodnight,
Mr. Grayle.

01:34.623 --> 01:37.458
<i>The address Grayle gave me</i>
<i>was an apartment block</i>

01:37.460 --> 01:39.894
<i>near Battery Park.</i>

01:39.896 --> 01:43.063
<i>He said it where</i>
<i>the statues lived.</i>

01:43.065 --> 01:47.234
<i>I asked him why he</i>
<i>didn't go look himself.</i>

01:47.236 --> 01:48.602
<i>He didn't answer.</i>

01:48.604 --> 01:50.571
<i>Grayle was</i>

01:50.573 --> 01:52.273
<i>the scariest guy</i>
<i>I knew.</i>

01:52.275 --> 01:54.742
<i>If something</i>
<i>scared</i> him,

01:54.744 --> 01:56.644
<i>I kind of wanted</i>
<i>to shake its hand.</i>

02:38.655 --> 02:40.922
Hello?

02:40.924 --> 02:42.423
Hello?!

03:03.146 --> 03:04.313
What the...?

03:44.289 --> 03:46.423
Hello?

03:46.425 --> 03:48.558
Anyone home?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.016
Hello.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.226
Who are you?!

04:22.228 --> 04:25.863
They're coming
for you.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.365
They're going to
send you back.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.034
Who's coming?
Back where?

04:30.036 --> 04:31.369
In time.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.371
Back in time.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.740
I'm you.

06:26.642 --> 06:28.041
<i>My stocking seams</i>

06:28.043 --> 06:29.776

06:29.778 --> 06:31.010

06:34.916 --> 06:36.415
Doctor, you're
doing it again.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.184
I'm reading!

06:38.186 --> 06:39.919
Out loud. Please,
could you not?

06:43.156 --> 06:44.656
There's something
different about you,

06:44.658 --> 06:46.158
isn't there?
What's the book?

06:46.160 --> 06:47.626
"Melody Malone."

06:47.628 --> 06:49.061
She's a private
detective

06:49.063 --> 06:51.997
in old-town
New York.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.498
She's got ice in her heart
and a kiss on her lips

06:53.500 --> 06:56.268
and a vulnerable side
she keeps well-hidden.

06:56.270 --> 06:57.769
Oh, you've read it.

06:57.771 --> 06:59.437
No, <i>you</i> read it.
Aloud.

06:59.439 --> 07:01.172
And then went
"Yowzah."

07:01.174 --> 07:03.474
You know, only you could
fancy someone in a book.

07:03.476 --> 07:05.409
I'm just reading.
I just like the cover.

07:05.411 --> 07:07.778
Ooh! Can we see
the cover?

07:07.780 --> 07:09.546
No. No.
I'm busy.

07:09.548 --> 07:11.114
It's your hair.

07:11.116 --> 07:12.616
Is it your hair?

07:12.618 --> 07:14.384
Oh, shut up.
It's the glasses.

07:14.386 --> 07:15.952
I'm wearing reading
glasses now.

07:15.954 --> 07:17.454
On my nose. See?
There you go.

07:17.456 --> 07:18.956
I don't like them.

07:18.958 --> 07:21.091
They make your eyes
look all liney.

07:21.093 --> 07:22.660
No, actually.

07:22.662 --> 07:24.062
Sorry.
They're fine.

07:24.064 --> 07:25.497
Carry on.

07:25.499 --> 07:27.700
O-kay. I'm going to go and
get us some more coffee.

07:27.702 --> 07:29.068
Who wants more coffee?
Me too! I'll go!

07:29.070 --> 07:31.370
Rory.

07:31.372 --> 07:33.039
Do I have noticeable
lines on my eyes now?

07:33.041 --> 07:34.040
Yes.

07:34.042 --> 07:35.208
No.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.709
You didn't look.

07:36.711 --> 07:39.245
I noticed them earlier.
<i>Didn't</i> notice them.

07:39.247 --> 07:42.548
I specifically remember
<i>not</i> noticing them.

07:42.550 --> 07:44.416
You walk among
fire pits, centurion.

07:44.418 --> 07:46.518
Do I have to come
over there?

07:46.520 --> 07:47.986
You can,
if you like.

07:47.988 --> 07:50.555
Well, we
have company.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.624
I'll get
a babysitter.

07:52.626 --> 07:53.825
Oh!

07:53.827 --> 07:55.460
Do you know,
it is so

07:55.462 --> 07:57.162
humiliating
when you do that.

07:57.164 --> 07:59.765
Coffee?

07:59.767 --> 08:01.266
Coffee.

08:01.268 --> 08:03.001
Can I have
a go?

08:04.772 --> 08:07.139
Oh!

08:07.141 --> 08:09.709
Actually, that is
much better.

08:09.711 --> 08:12.045
That is exciting.

08:12.047 --> 08:14.247
Read to me.

08:14.249 --> 08:15.649
I thought you didn't
like my reading aloud.

08:15.651 --> 08:17.050
Shut up and read me
a story.

08:17.052 --> 08:18.418
Just don't go
"Yowzah!"

08:19.722 --> 08:21.188
Ah!

08:21.190 --> 08:22.690
Why did you
do that?

08:22.692 --> 08:24.458
Oh, I always rip out
the last page of a book.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.460
Then it doesn't
have to end.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.029
I <i>hate</i> endings.

08:29.498 --> 08:32.299
<i>As I crossed</i>
<i>the street,</i>

08:32.301 --> 08:35.903
<i>I saw the thin guy,</i>
<i>but he didn't see me.</i>

08:35.905 --> 08:39.706
<i>I guess that's</i>
<i>how it began.</i>

09:20.480 --> 09:22.882
<i>I followed the skinny guy</i>
<i>for two more blocks</i>

09:22.884 --> 09:24.451
<i>before he turned</i>

09:24.453 --> 09:27.453
<i>and I could ask exactly</i>
<i>what he was doing here.</i>

09:27.455 --> 09:29.389
<i>He looked a little</i>
<i>scared, so I gave him</i>

09:29.391 --> 09:32.291
<i>my best smile</i>
<i>and my bluest eyes.</i>

09:32.293 --> 09:33.793
And beware
of the "yowzah."

09:33.795 --> 09:35.894
Do not, at this
point, yowz.

09:39.299 --> 09:42.534
Doctor? What did
the skinny guy say?

09:42.536 --> 09:44.436
<i>He said,</i>

09:44.438 --> 09:45.804
<i>"I just went</i>
<i>to get coffees</i>

09:45.806 --> 09:47.339
<i>"for the Doctor</i>
<i>and Amy.</i>

09:47.341 --> 09:48.907
<i>Hello, River."</i>

09:51.477 --> 09:53.078
Hello, Dad.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.913
Where am I?

09:54.915 --> 09:56.648
How the hell
did I get here?

09:56.650 --> 09:59.784
I haven't
the faintest idea.

09:59.786 --> 10:01.953
But you'll probably want
to put your hands up.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.527
Melody Malone?

10:09.529 --> 10:11.062
<i>You're</i> Melody?!

10:13.066 --> 10:14.766
Get in.

10:14.768 --> 10:16.401
What's River doing
in a book?

10:16.403 --> 10:18.103
What's <i>Rory</i>
<i>doing in a book?</i>

10:18.105 --> 10:20.104
He went to get coffee.
Pay attention.

10:20.106 --> 10:21.573
He went to get coffee
and turned up in a book.

10:21.575 --> 10:23.575
How does that work?

10:23.577 --> 10:25.644
I don't know!
We're in New York!

10:25.646 --> 10:29.549
What is going on?

10:29.551 --> 10:31.451
Where did you get this book?
It was in my jacket.

10:31.453 --> 10:32.953
How did it get
<i>there?</i>

10:32.955 --> 10:34.454
How does anything get there?
I've given up asking.

10:34.456 --> 10:35.956
Date. Date. Does she
mention a date?

10:35.958 --> 10:37.391
When is this
happening?

10:37.393 --> 10:38.825
Yes, hang on.
Uh --

10:38.827 --> 10:40.761
ooh!
April 3, 1938.

10:43.898 --> 10:46.967
You didn't come here
in the TARDIS, obviously.

10:46.969 --> 10:47.968
Why?

10:47.970 --> 10:49.803
You couldn't have.

10:49.805 --> 10:51.038
Couldn't have?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.940
What does she mean,
"couldn't have"?

10:52.942 --> 10:55.610
This city's full
of time distortions.

10:55.612 --> 10:57.712
Be impossible to land
the TARDIS here.

10:57.714 --> 11:01.149
Like trying to land
a plane in a blizzard.

11:01.151 --> 11:03.051
Even I couldn't
do it.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.420
Even who
couldn't do it?!

11:04.422 --> 11:06.121
Don't you two
fall out.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.523
She's only
in a book.

11:07.525 --> 11:11.494
Ha ha. 1938.
Easy one.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.330
Aah! Aah!

11:22.107 --> 11:23.906
Ah!

11:23.908 --> 11:25.408
What was that?

11:25.410 --> 11:27.610
1938.

11:27.612 --> 11:30.045
We just
bounced off it.

11:30.047 --> 11:32.815
Well, how
did you get here?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.651
Vortex Manipulator.
Less bulky than a TARDIS.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.721
A motorbike
through traffic.

11:38.723 --> 11:40.889
You?

11:40.891 --> 11:42.491
I'm...

11:42.493 --> 11:43.925
not sure.

11:53.848 --> 11:55.248
The weeping
Angels.

11:55.338 --> 11:56.671
It makes sense.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.039
It makes <i>what?</i>

11:58.041 --> 11:59.741
That's what happened to Rory.
That's what the Angels do.

11:59.743 --> 12:01.142
It's their preferred
form of attack.

12:01.144 --> 12:02.543
They zap you back
in time,

12:02.545 --> 12:03.911
let you live
to death.

12:03.913 --> 12:05.412
Well, we've got
a time machine.

12:05.414 --> 12:06.980
We can just go
and get him.

12:06.982 --> 12:08.382
Well, tried that,
if you've noticed,

12:08.384 --> 12:09.983
and we are back where
we started, in 2012!

12:09.985 --> 12:11.484
We didn't start
in a graveyard.

12:11.486 --> 12:12.986
What are we
doing here?

12:12.988 --> 12:15.455
Don't know. Probably
causally linked, somehow.

12:15.457 --> 12:16.890
Doesn't matter.

12:16.892 --> 12:18.424
Extractor fans on!

12:18.426 --> 12:19.825
Well, we're going to
get there, somehow.

12:19.827 --> 12:21.193
We're in the rest
of the book.

12:21.195 --> 12:22.361
In what?

12:22.363 --> 12:23.795
Page 43. You're going
to break something.

12:23.797 --> 12:25.130
I'm what?

12:25.132 --> 12:27.199
<i>"Why do you have to</i>
<i>break mine?"</i>

12:27.201 --> 12:28.700
<i>I asked the Doctor.</i>
<i>He frowned and said,</i>

12:28.702 --> 12:30.402
<i>"because Amy read it</i>
<i>in a book</i>

12:30.404 --> 12:31.970
<i>and, now, I have</i>
<i>no choice."</i>

12:31.972 --> 12:34.540
Stop! No! No! Stop!
You can't read ahead.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.543
You mustn't and --
and you can't do that.

12:37.545 --> 12:38.877
But we've already
been reading it.

12:38.879 --> 12:40.212
Just the stuff
that's happening now,

12:40.214 --> 12:41.814
in parallel with us.
That's as far as we go.

12:41.816 --> 12:43.949
It could help us
find Rory.

12:43.951 --> 12:45.952
And if you read ahead
and find that Rory dies?

12:45.954 --> 12:49.822
This isn't any old
future, Amy, it's ours.

12:49.824 --> 12:51.891
Once we know what's
coming, it's fixed.

12:51.893 --> 12:54.060
I'm going to
break something

12:54.062 --> 12:55.495
because you told me
that I'm going to do it.

12:55.497 --> 12:56.863
No choice now.

12:56.865 --> 12:58.265
Time can be
rewritten.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.434
Not once
you've read it.

13:00.436 --> 13:02.069
Once we know
it's coming,

13:02.071 --> 13:04.104
it's written
in stone.

13:14.682 --> 13:17.050
Ah, early Chin
Dynasty, I'd say.

13:17.052 --> 13:18.818
Correct.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.887
Are you an archaeologist
as well as a detective?

13:23.624 --> 13:26.425
Okay, landing a plane

13:26.427 --> 13:27.927
in a timey wimey
blizzard.

13:27.929 --> 13:29.428
I could push through,
but, if I'm out

13:29.430 --> 13:31.096
by a nanosecond,
the engines will phase

13:31.098 --> 13:33.065
and I'll shatter
the planet.

13:33.067 --> 13:35.134
I need landing lights.
Landing lights?

13:35.136 --> 13:36.835
Yes, I need a signal
to lock on to.

13:36.837 --> 13:38.704
What did she say,
early what dynasty?

13:38.706 --> 13:42.373
Early Chin,
just as you say.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.875
You're very
well-informed.

13:43.877 --> 13:45.376
And you're
very afraid.

13:45.378 --> 13:47.512
That's an awful lot
of locks for one door.

13:52.752 --> 13:54.586
River,
I'm translating.

13:54.588 --> 13:56.255
It's a gift of
the TARDIS. It hangs around.

13:56.257 --> 13:58.457
This one.

13:58.459 --> 13:59.992
Put him somewhere
uncomfortable.

13:59.994 --> 14:02.995
With the babies,
sir?

14:02.997 --> 14:05.599
Yes. Why not? Give him
to the babies.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.601
Ah ah ah
ah ah!

14:14.475 --> 14:16.777
Oh!

14:16.779 --> 14:19.179
The lights are out.

14:19.181 --> 14:20.481
You'll last longer
with these.

14:22.684 --> 14:24.085
What do you care?

14:24.087 --> 14:25.987
It's funnier.

14:32.862 --> 14:34.395
Hello?

14:42.469 --> 14:45.104
Ah, hello.
Yes.

14:47.107 --> 14:49.241
Special permission
from the emperor.

14:53.381 --> 14:55.715
Hello, sweetie.

14:55.717 --> 14:57.216
Let's see --

14:57.218 --> 15:00.853
crime boss with
a collecting fetish.

15:02.823 --> 15:04.590
Whatever you don't want
anyone else to see

15:04.592 --> 15:07.427
has got to be
your favorite.

15:07.429 --> 15:10.664
Or, possibly,
your girlfriend.

15:15.270 --> 15:17.972
So, girlfriend,
then.

15:19.542 --> 15:21.676
What are you doing?

15:21.678 --> 15:22.878
Oh, you know,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.881
texting a boy.

15:31.589 --> 15:32.755
Landing lights.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.823
We have a signal.

15:34.825 --> 15:35.991
Locking on.

15:37.827 --> 15:39.595
Ah!
Ah!

15:39.597 --> 15:42.731
These things
are all over,

15:42.733 --> 15:44.166
but people
don't seem to notice.

15:44.168 --> 15:47.269
It never moves
while you're looking.

15:47.271 --> 15:49.138
Oh, I know
how they work.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.106
So I understand.

15:51.108 --> 15:53.141
Melody Malone,

15:53.143 --> 15:56.745
the detective who
investigates Angels.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.546
Badly damaged.

15:58.548 --> 16:00.548
I wanted to know

16:00.550 --> 16:02.016
if it could
feel pain.

16:02.018 --> 16:03.518
You realize
it's screaming?

16:03.520 --> 16:05.853
The others can hear.

16:05.855 --> 16:09.624
Is that why you
need all the locks?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.033
You're going to tell me
all about these creatures.

16:19.036 --> 16:21.805
And you're going to
do it quickly.

16:21.807 --> 16:22.773
Ohh!

16:35.821 --> 16:39.824
Hello,
is someone there?

17:15.595 --> 17:17.429
Come on!

17:17.431 --> 17:19.832
Come on!

17:25.400 --> 17:26.767
The Angels
are predators.

17:26.907 --> 17:28.540
They're deadly. What do
you want with them?

17:29.339 --> 17:30.906
I'm a collector.

17:30.908 --> 17:33.441
What collector
could resist these?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.444
I'm only human.

17:35.446 --> 17:38.047
That's exactly what
they're thinking.

17:38.049 --> 17:40.149
What's that?
What's happening?

17:41.486 --> 17:44.354
Is it an earthquake?

17:46.424 --> 17:47.690
Anh!
Ah!

17:47.692 --> 17:48.892
Ah!

17:48.894 --> 17:51.094
What is it?!

17:53.198 --> 17:54.665
Oh, you bad boy.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.033
You could burn
New York.

17:58.102 --> 17:59.803
What does
that mean?!

17:59.805 --> 18:01.504
It means,
Mr. Grayle,

18:01.506 --> 18:04.574
just you wait 'til
my husband gets home.

18:05.844 --> 18:09.212
Aaaaah!

18:09.214 --> 18:11.147
Come on.

18:11.149 --> 18:14.050
Just a moment.
Final checks.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.384
Since when?

18:29.298 --> 18:31.566
Rory?

18:31.568 --> 18:34.535
Rory!

18:36.006 --> 18:38.407
Rory?!

18:38.409 --> 18:40.643
Sorry I'm late,
honey.

18:40.645 --> 18:42.545
Traffic was hell.

18:48.552 --> 18:51.821
Shock.

18:51.823 --> 18:53.322
He'll be fine.

18:53.324 --> 18:54.957
Not if I can
get loose.

19:01.298 --> 19:03.265
So where are we
now, Dr. Song?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.234
How's prison?

19:05.236 --> 19:06.735
Oh, I was pardoned
ages ago.

19:06.737 --> 19:10.706
And it's "Professor"
song, to you.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.075
Pardoned?

19:12.077 --> 19:13.810
Mmm! Turns out
the person I killed

19:13.812 --> 19:15.578
never existed,
in the first place.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.114
Apparently, there's
no record of him.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.749
It's almost
as if someone's

19:19.751 --> 19:21.251
gone around,
deleting himself

19:21.253 --> 19:23.920
from every database
in the universe.

19:23.922 --> 19:26.256
Mmm, you said
I'd got too big.

19:26.258 --> 19:28.458
And, now, no one's
ever heard of you.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.260
Didn't you used to
be somebody?

19:30.262 --> 19:32.496
Weren't you the woman
who killed the Doctor?

19:32.498 --> 19:33.530
Doctor who?

19:33.532 --> 19:35.833
Ha.

19:35.835 --> 19:37.535
She's holding you
very tight.

19:37.537 --> 19:39.237
At least she didn't
send me back in time.

19:39.239 --> 19:40.638
I doubt she's
strong enough.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.373
Well, I need
a handbag.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.941
So which is it
going to be,

19:43.943 --> 19:48.046
are you going to break
my wrist or hers?

19:48.048 --> 19:49.982
Oh, no.

19:49.984 --> 19:51.216
Really?

19:51.218 --> 19:52.584
Why do you have to
break mine?

19:52.586 --> 19:54.320
Because Amy read it
in a book

19:54.322 --> 19:56.622
and, now, I have
no choice.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.593
You see?

20:00.595 --> 20:02.228
Well, what book?

20:02.230 --> 20:04.230
Your book.

20:04.232 --> 20:07.367
Which you haven't
written yet, so we can't read!

20:07.369 --> 20:09.501
I see. I don't like
the cover much.

20:09.503 --> 20:11.003
But if River's going
to write that book,

20:11.005 --> 20:12.405
she'd make it
useful, yeah?

20:12.407 --> 20:13.839
Well, I'll
certainly try.

20:13.841 --> 20:15.741
But we can't read ahead.
It's too dangerous.

20:15.743 --> 20:18.011
I know, but there must be
something we can look at.

20:18.013 --> 20:19.512
What, a page
of handy hints,

20:19.514 --> 20:20.847
previews,
spoilerfree?

20:20.849 --> 20:24.050
Chapter titles.

20:26.087 --> 20:27.353
Hmm?

20:31.959 --> 20:33.493
He's in the cellar.

20:33.495 --> 20:35.796
Gimme.

20:42.004 --> 20:43.471
Doctor?

20:43.473 --> 20:44.972
Doctor,
what is it?

20:44.974 --> 20:46.841
What's wrong?
Tell me.

20:46.843 --> 20:49.310
Doctor.

20:49.312 --> 20:52.080
Doctor, what is it?
Tell me.

20:55.018 --> 20:57.252
Okay,
I know that face.

20:57.254 --> 20:58.320
Calm down!

20:58.322 --> 20:59.788
Calm down!

20:59.790 --> 21:01.089
No!

21:01.091 --> 21:02.457
Talk to me!
Doctor!

21:02.459 --> 21:04.459
No! You get
your wrist out.

21:04.461 --> 21:06.895
You get your wrist out
without breaking it.

21:06.897 --> 21:08.063
How?

21:08.065 --> 21:09.564
I don't know.
Just do it!

21:09.566 --> 21:11.700
Change the future!

21:20.610 --> 21:22.577
Rory?

21:24.714 --> 21:25.713
No!
Aah!

21:25.715 --> 21:27.648
They're Angels!

21:27.650 --> 21:29.383
Baby Angels.

21:29.385 --> 21:31.085
Did they get Rory?

21:31.087 --> 21:34.255
Where is he?
Did they take him?

21:34.257 --> 21:36.524
Yes, I think so,
yes.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.415
So is this what's
going to happen?

21:56.417 --> 21:58.518
We just keep chasing
him back in time

21:58.520 --> 22:00.287
and they keep pulling
him further back.

22:00.289 --> 22:02.122
He isn't back in time.
I'm reading a displacement,

22:02.124 --> 22:03.857
but there are no
temporal markers.

22:03.873 --> 22:06.474
He's been moved
in space, not in time,

22:06.476 --> 22:07.976
and it's not
that far from here,

22:07.978 --> 22:09.678
by the look of it.

22:11.173 --> 22:14.074
You got out.

22:14.076 --> 22:16.343
So where is he?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.161
Well, come on, come on,
come on, where is he?!

22:34.163 --> 22:35.879
If it was that easy,
I'd get <i>you</i> to do it.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.614
How did you get
your wrist out

22:37.616 --> 22:39.016
without
breaking it?

22:39.018 --> 22:40.250
You asked. I did.
Problem?

22:41.921 --> 22:43.520
You just changed
the future!

22:43.522 --> 22:45.022
It's called
"marriage," honey.

22:45.024 --> 22:46.623
Now, hush.
I'm working.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.092
She's good, huh?
Oh!

22:48.094 --> 22:50.328
Have you noticed?
Really, <i>really</i> good.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.563
Ah, wherever it is,
it's within a few blocks.

22:52.565 --> 22:54.199
There's a car out front.
Shall we steal it?

22:54.201 --> 22:55.767
Show me!

23:22.162 --> 23:24.897
Okay, when
all those numbers

23:24.899 --> 23:26.866
on both units
go to zero,

23:26.868 --> 23:28.301
that's when we've got
a lock, okay?

23:28.303 --> 23:30.870
That's how
we find Rory.

23:30.872 --> 23:33.772
Got it.

23:33.774 --> 23:35.775
Why did you lie
to me?

23:39.579 --> 23:42.648
When one's in love
with an ageless God

23:42.650 --> 23:44.516
who insists
on the face

23:44.518 --> 23:46.585
of a 12-year-old,

23:46.587 --> 23:50.088
one does one's best
to hide the damage.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.991
It must hurt.

23:52.993 --> 23:54.226
Come here.

23:54.228 --> 23:56.862
Yes.

23:56.864 --> 23:58.764
The wrist is
pretty bad, too.

24:11.777 --> 24:12.876
No. No.

24:12.878 --> 24:14.945
No, stop that.
Stop that!

24:14.947 --> 24:18.382
Stop it!

24:18.384 --> 24:21.585
There you are.

24:21.587 --> 24:23.253
How's that?

24:23.255 --> 24:26.357
Well,

24:26.359 --> 24:28.259
let's see,
shall we?

24:28.261 --> 24:29.260
Ah!

24:29.262 --> 24:30.828
That was
a <i>stupid</i> waste

24:30.830 --> 24:32.196
of regeneration
energy.

24:32.198 --> 24:33.631
Nothing is gained
by you being

24:33.633 --> 24:35.066
a sentimental
idiot!

24:35.068 --> 24:36.067
River!

24:36.069 --> 24:37.501
No! You
embarrass me!

24:37.503 --> 24:38.436
River!

24:40.772 --> 24:43.741
Tell you what --

24:43.743 --> 24:45.643
stick to
the science part.

24:53.051 --> 24:57.722
Okay,
why did you lie?

24:57.724 --> 25:02.027
Never let him see
the damage.

25:02.029 --> 25:05.063
Hey. Hey.

25:05.065 --> 25:08.900
And never, ever,

25:08.902 --> 25:12.170
let him
see you age.

25:12.172 --> 25:14.206
He doesn't like
endings.

25:18.613 --> 25:20.846
There you are.

25:20.848 --> 25:22.748
Got it!

25:22.750 --> 25:24.484
He's in a place
called Winter Quay.

25:24.486 --> 25:26.252
The car, yes?
Let's go.

25:48.943 --> 25:51.244
Ah.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.395
Oh.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.970
Why would they
send him here?

26:49.972 --> 26:51.505
Why not zap him
back in time,

26:51.507 --> 26:53.006
like they
normally do?

26:53.008 --> 26:54.974
We'll know that when we
know what this place is.

26:56.711 --> 26:58.144
Winter Quay.

27:07.055 --> 27:08.388
Rory.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.223
He's close.

27:10.225 --> 27:11.257
Rory!

27:14.128 --> 27:15.094
Rory!

27:15.096 --> 27:16.696
Amy.

27:18.299 --> 27:19.898
Doctor.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.367
Look at this.

27:22.369 --> 27:24.870
Why is it smiling?

27:29.575 --> 27:31.209
Amy. Rory!

27:31.211 --> 27:32.478
Get out of here.
Don't look at anything.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.112
Don't touch anything.

27:34.114 --> 27:35.480
Who's that?

27:37.751 --> 27:39.184
Amy!

27:39.186 --> 27:43.388
Amy, please.

27:50.030 --> 27:52.897
Amy.

27:52.899 --> 27:56.634
Please.

27:56.636 --> 27:57.802
Please.

28:05.245 --> 28:07.145
Rory.

28:14.221 --> 28:15.454
He's you.

28:23.897 --> 28:25.663
Amy.

28:36.341 --> 28:37.742
Someone, please,

28:37.744 --> 28:39.243
tell me what
is going on.

28:45.784 --> 28:49.353
I'm sorry, Rory,

28:49.355 --> 28:51.189
but you just died.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.704
This place
is policed by Angels.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.205
Every time
you try to escape,

29:09.207 --> 29:10.706
you get zapped back
in time.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.208
So this place belongs
to the Angels?

29:12.210 --> 29:13.643
They built it?

29:13.645 --> 29:15.077
Displacing someone
back in time

29:15.079 --> 29:17.380
creates time energy
and <i>that</i>

29:17.382 --> 29:19.749
is what the Angels
feed on.

29:19.751 --> 29:20.950
But, normally,
it's a one-off,

29:20.952 --> 29:22.986
a hit-and-run.

29:22.988 --> 29:25.221
If they could keep
hold of their victims,

29:25.223 --> 29:26.756
feed off
their time energy

29:26.758 --> 29:29.759
over and over again...

29:29.761 --> 29:32.195
This place is a farm,

29:32.197 --> 29:34.964
a battery farm.

29:34.966 --> 29:36.699
How many Angels
in New York?

29:36.701 --> 29:38.401
It's like they've taken over
every statue in the city.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.237
Yeah, the Angels take
Manhattan because they can.

29:40.239 --> 29:41.738
Because they've never
had a food source

29:41.740 --> 29:44.141
like this one, the city
that never sleeps.

29:46.345 --> 29:48.311
What was that?

29:50.248 --> 29:52.315
I don't know.

29:52.317 --> 29:55.018
But I think they're
coming for you.

29:56.989 --> 29:59.257
What does that mean?

29:59.259 --> 30:00.758
What is going to
happen to me?

30:00.760 --> 30:02.327
What is physically
going to happen?

30:02.329 --> 30:05.163
The Angels
will come for you.

30:05.165 --> 30:06.998
They'll zap you back
in time,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.033
to this very spot,
30 40 years ago,

30:09.035 --> 30:12.637
and you will live out
the rest of your life

30:12.639 --> 30:14.740
in that room,

30:14.742 --> 30:16.942
until you die
in that bed.

30:19.847 --> 30:21.347
And will Amy
be there?

30:21.349 --> 30:22.582
No.

30:23.093 --> 30:24.181
How do you know?

30:24.182 --> 30:26.082
Because he was so pleased
to see you again.

30:30.794 --> 30:33.829
Okay. Well, they haven't
taken me yet.

30:33.831 --> 30:36.398
What if I just run?

30:36.400 --> 30:38.224
What if I just get
the hell out of here?

30:38.225 --> 30:39.794
Then that
never happens.

30:39.795 --> 30:41.347
It's already
happened, Rory.

30:41.348 --> 30:43.081
You've just witnessed
your own future.

30:43.083 --> 30:46.384
Doctor, he's right.
No, he isn't.

30:46.919 --> 30:48.819
If Rory got out, it
would create a paradox,

30:48.821 --> 30:50.921
What is that?

30:51.053 --> 30:52.453
This is the Angels'
food source.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.286
The paradox
poisons the well.

30:54.288 --> 30:55.654
It could
kill them all.

30:56.138 --> 30:59.573
This whole place would
literally unhappen.

30:59.575 --> 31:01.475
It would be
almost impossible.

31:01.477 --> 31:02.877
Loving the "almost".

31:02.879 --> 31:05.879
But to create
a paradox like that

31:05.881 --> 31:08.015
takes almost
unimaginable power.

31:08.017 --> 31:09.517
What have we got?
Eh? Tell me.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.085
Come on, what?

31:14.022 --> 31:16.224
I won't let them
take him.

31:16.226 --> 31:17.726
That's what we got.

31:20.331 --> 31:22.298
Whatever
that thing is,

31:22.300 --> 31:23.833
it's getting closer.

31:23.835 --> 31:24.834
Rory,

31:24.836 --> 31:26.335
even if you got out,
you'd have to

31:26.337 --> 31:27.837
keep running for
the rest of your life.

31:27.839 --> 31:32.208
They would be
chasing you forever.

31:32.210 --> 31:35.244
Well, then,
better get started.

31:35.246 --> 31:36.745
Husband, run!

31:42.353 --> 31:44.488
River, I'm not sure
this can work.

31:44.490 --> 31:47.691
Husband, shut up.

31:52.130 --> 31:53.064
Ah!

31:55.967 --> 31:57.635
Up!

31:57.637 --> 31:59.070
What good's up?

31:59.072 --> 32:00.572
Better than down.

32:00.574 --> 32:03.141
I can't keep
doing this.

32:03.143 --> 32:05.410
Any ideas?
Yeah, the usual.

32:05.412 --> 32:06.777
Run.

32:24.761 --> 32:28.931
Uh, okay,
fire escape.

32:28.933 --> 32:30.632
I always
wanted to visit

32:30.634 --> 32:32.133
the Statue
of Liberty.

32:32.135 --> 32:34.268
I guess she got
impatient.

32:38.107 --> 32:39.474
What? What is it?
What?

32:39.476 --> 32:41.643
Just keep your eyes
on that!

32:41.645 --> 32:43.879
Is there
a way down?

32:43.881 --> 32:47.749
Uh...no.

32:47.751 --> 32:50.853
But there's
a way out.

32:50.855 --> 32:53.156
What are you
doing?

32:53.158 --> 32:55.792
Oh.

32:55.794 --> 32:57.994
Rory, what
are you doing?

33:00.264 --> 33:01.364
Rory.

33:01.366 --> 33:02.932
Stop it!
You'll die.

33:02.934 --> 33:04.167
Yeah, twice.

33:04.169 --> 33:06.236
In the same building
on the same night.

33:06.238 --> 33:07.737
Who else
could do that?

33:07.739 --> 33:09.372
Just come down,
please.

33:09.374 --> 33:10.873
This is the right
thing to do.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.142
This will work.
If I die now,

33:13.144 --> 33:14.643
it's a paradox,
right?

33:14.645 --> 33:16.178
The paradox will
kill the Angels.

33:16.180 --> 33:18.113
Tell me I'm wrong.

33:18.115 --> 33:21.417
Go on, please, because
I am really scared.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.788
Great.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.690
The one time
you can't manage it.

33:32.995 --> 33:36.364
Oh, God.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.168
Amy.

33:41.170 --> 33:44.872
I'm going to need
a little help here.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.642
Just stop it!

33:47.644 --> 33:49.043
No, just think it
through.

33:49.045 --> 33:50.611
This will work. This
will kill the Angels.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.948
It will kill you, too.
Will it?! River said that this place

33:52.950 --> 33:54.450
would be erased from
time, never exist.

33:54.452 --> 33:56.051
If this place never existed,
what did I fall off?

33:56.053 --> 33:58.254
You think you'll just
come back to life?

33:58.256 --> 34:00.289
When don't I?
Rory!

34:00.291 --> 34:01.991
And, anyway,
what else is there?

34:01.993 --> 34:04.293
Dying of old age downstairs,
never seeing you again.

34:04.295 --> 34:07.764
Amy, please.

34:07.766 --> 34:09.498
If you love me,

34:09.501 --> 34:12.435
then trust me
and push.

34:15.105 --> 34:16.438
I can't.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.806
You have to!

34:17.809 --> 34:19.074
Could you?

34:19.076 --> 34:21.243
If it was me,
could you do it?

34:25.081 --> 34:28.216
To save you,

34:28.217 --> 34:29.817
I could do
anything.

34:52.541 --> 34:54.074
Prove it.

34:54.077 --> 34:55.577
No, I can't
take you, too.

34:55.579 --> 34:57.412
You said we'd
come back to life.

34:57.414 --> 35:00.682
"Money where your
mouth is" time.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.683
Amy!

35:01.685 --> 35:04.853
Shut. Up.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.255
Together.

35:06.257 --> 35:09.191
Or not at all.

35:09.193 --> 35:11.093
What the hell
are you doing?!

35:11.095 --> 35:12.761
Changing
the future.

35:15.598 --> 35:19.500
It's called
"marriage."

35:21.069 --> 35:22.803
Amy!

35:22.805 --> 35:25.105
Amy!

35:27.008 --> 35:29.043
Amy!

35:45.727 --> 35:46.827
Doctor!

35:51.167 --> 35:52.967
What's
happening?!

35:52.969 --> 35:55.135
The paradox,

35:55.137 --> 35:57.104
it's working.

35:57.106 --> 35:58.605
The paradox
is working!

36:16.487 --> 36:18.154
Whoa! Whoa.

36:18.481 --> 36:19.980
Where are we?

36:19.982 --> 36:21.249
Back where
we started!

36:21.251 --> 36:23.111
You collapsed the timeline.
The paradox worked.

36:23.112 --> 36:25.279
We all pinged back
where we belong.

36:25.281 --> 36:26.747
What, in
a graveyard?

36:26.749 --> 36:28.949
This happened last time.
Why always here?

36:28.951 --> 36:30.317
Does it matter?
We got lucky!

36:30.319 --> 36:32.153
We could've blown New York
off the planet.

36:32.155 --> 36:33.921
I can't ever take
the TARDIS back there.

36:33.923 --> 36:36.090
The timelines
are too scrambled.

36:36.092 --> 36:39.159
Oh, I could've
lost you both.

36:39.161 --> 36:40.460
Oh.

36:40.462 --> 36:42.529
Don't ever
do that again.

36:42.531 --> 36:43.964
What did we do?

36:43.966 --> 36:45.966
We fixed it.
We solved the problem.

36:45.968 --> 36:49.302
I was talking
to myself.

36:52.741 --> 36:57.443
It could do with
a repaint.

36:57.445 --> 36:58.778
I've been busy.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.413
Does the bulb on top
need changing?

37:00.415 --> 37:03.082
Just changed it.

37:03.084 --> 37:04.718
So,

37:04.720 --> 37:06.119
Rory and Amy,
then.

37:06.121 --> 37:08.355
Yes, I know.
I know.

37:08.357 --> 37:10.156
I'm just saying,
they're going to get

37:10.158 --> 37:11.524
terribly bored, hanging
round here all day.

37:11.526 --> 37:13.193
Doctor.

37:13.195 --> 37:14.461
Ha!

37:14.463 --> 37:16.329
Next time, can we
just go to the pub?

37:16.331 --> 37:18.031
I want to go
to the pub right now.

37:18.033 --> 37:21.001
Are there videogames there?
I love videogames.

37:21.003 --> 37:22.835
Right, family
outing, then.

37:30.244 --> 37:31.478
Amy!
Come see this.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.479
What?

37:32.481 --> 37:34.914
There's
a gravestone here

37:34.916 --> 37:37.116
for someone with
the same name as me.

37:37.118 --> 37:38.852
What?

37:41.689 --> 37:43.657
Doctor!

37:43.659 --> 37:45.993
Ah!

37:45.995 --> 37:48.062
Where the hell
did that come from?

37:48.064 --> 37:49.563
It's a survivor.
Very weak.

37:49.565 --> 37:51.266
But keep your eyes
on it.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.335
Where's Rory?

38:02.412 --> 38:05.948
I'm sorry.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.850
Amelia.

38:07.852 --> 38:11.788
I'm so,
so sorry.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.489
No.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.392
No, we can just go and
get him in the TARDIS.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.893
One more paradox.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.362
Would rip New York
apart and I --

38:18.364 --> 38:19.830
No, that's not true.
I don't believe you.

38:19.832 --> 38:21.832
Mother, it's true.

38:25.171 --> 38:27.304
Amy?
What are you doing?

38:27.306 --> 38:29.306
That gravestone,
Rory's,

38:29.308 --> 38:31.174
there's room for one
more name, isn't there?

38:31.176 --> 38:32.342
What are you
talking about?

38:32.344 --> 38:33.911
Back away from the Angel.
Come back to the TARDIS!

38:33.913 --> 38:35.212
We'll figure
something out!

38:35.214 --> 38:37.281
The Angel, would it send me back
to the same time, to him?

38:37.283 --> 38:39.750
I don't know.
Nobody knows.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.585
But it's my best
shot, yeah?

38:41.587 --> 38:42.753
No!

38:42.755 --> 38:44.888
Doctor, shut up!
Yes, yes, it is!

38:44.890 --> 38:46.290
Amy --

38:46.292 --> 38:48.359
Well, then, I just
have to blink, right?

38:48.361 --> 38:49.360
No!

38:49.362 --> 38:51.395
It'll be fine.
I know it will.

38:51.397 --> 38:54.599
I'll -- I'll be with him,
like I should be.

38:54.601 --> 38:56.000
Me and Rory,
together.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.604
Melody.

39:00.606 --> 39:01.973
Stop it! Just --
just stop it!

39:08.647 --> 39:11.515
You look after him.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.117
And you be a good girl

39:13.119 --> 39:14.785
and you
look after him.

39:14.787 --> 39:17.755
You are creating
a fixed time.

39:17.757 --> 39:20.124
I will never be able
to see you again.

39:20.126 --> 39:22.593
I'll be fine.
I'll be with him.

39:22.595 --> 39:24.695
Amy, please.

39:24.697 --> 39:26.163
Just --

39:27.166 --> 39:29.166
Come back
into the TARDIS.

39:29.168 --> 39:33.737
Come on, Pond,
please.

39:35.874 --> 39:39.242
Raggedy man,

39:39.244 --> 39:40.944
goodbye.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.952
No!

40:19.619 --> 40:23.756
River.

40:23.758 --> 40:26.558
They were
your parents.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.961
Sorry.

40:28.963 --> 40:30.996
I didn't
even think.

40:30.998 --> 40:33.599
It doesn't matter.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.268
Of course
it matters.

40:35.270 --> 40:37.203
What matters
is this:

40:37.205 --> 40:38.972
Doctor,

40:38.974 --> 40:40.540
don't travel alone.

40:43.645 --> 40:46.046
Travel with me,
then.

40:49.118 --> 40:52.320
Whenever and wherever
you want.

40:54.056 --> 40:56.657
But not
all the time.

40:56.659 --> 40:58.559
One pyschopath per
TARDIS, don't you think?

41:06.134 --> 41:07.601
Okay,

41:07.603 --> 41:09.202
this book
I've got to write,

41:09.204 --> 41:10.437
Melody Malone.

41:10.439 --> 41:12.806
I presume I send it to Amy
to get it published?

41:12.808 --> 41:15.375
Yes. Yes.

41:18.613 --> 41:20.346
I'll tell her to write
an afterword.

41:23.117 --> 41:24.284
For you.

41:30.491 --> 41:32.058
Maybe you'll
listen to her.

41:40.234 --> 41:41.735
The last page.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.054
<i>Afterword,</i>
<i>by Amelia Williams.</i>

42:03.056 --> 42:04.656
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

42:04.658 --> 42:07.759
<i>And here we are,</i>
<i>you and me,</i>

42:07.761 --> 42:09.394
<i>on the last page.</i>

42:09.396 --> 42:12.564
<i>By the time you read</i>
<i>these words,</i>

42:12.566 --> 42:14.199
<i>Rory and I will be</i>
<i>long gone.</i>

42:14.201 --> 42:18.569
<i>So know that we lived well</i>
<i>and were very happy.</i>

42:18.571 --> 42:20.537
<i>And, above all else,</i>

42:20.539 --> 42:25.242
<i>know that we</i>
<i>will love you always.</i>

42:25.244 --> 42:28.112
<i>Sometimes I do worry</i>
<i>about you, though.</i>

42:28.114 --> 42:29.614
<i>I think,</i>
<i>once we're gone,</i>

42:29.616 --> 42:32.516
<i>you won't be coming back</i>
<i>here for a while</i>

42:32.518 --> 42:34.018
<i>and you might be alone,</i>

42:34.020 --> 42:36.654
<i>which you</i>
