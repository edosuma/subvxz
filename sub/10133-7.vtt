08:50.989 --> 08:52.573
and order one.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.000
Michelle, I know

09:00.207 --> 09:02.000
you're in there.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.003
Come on out, Michelle.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.921
Okay, young lady

09:06.963 --> 09:09.590
I'm gonna come in there

09:06.963 --> 09:09.590
and get you.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.385
I'm gonna come in and get you.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.345
[Jesse screaming]

09:14.929 --> 09:16.348
What are you doin' here?

09:16.390 --> 09:19.267
[barking]

09:19.309 --> 09:20.435
Where did you come from?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.979
[barking]

09:23.021 --> 09:24.105
A likely story.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.191
Get out!

09:33.156 --> 09:35.992
Hey, you better fix it.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
(Jesse)

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
'Where are you,

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
you mangy mutt?'

09:37.494 --> 09:39.120
Uh-oh, trouble.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.206
Go under the bed.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.959
Hurry!

09:45.001 --> 09:46.627
Alright, dog.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.627
I know you're in here.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.129
Come out with your paws up.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.798
No doggy here.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.718
[barks]

09:52.008 --> 09:53.718
Oh, well..

09:55.845 --> 09:58.306
Then who just went, "woof."

09:58.348 --> 09:59.724
I went, "ruff."

10:01.601 --> 10:03.395
I don't think so.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.024
Who's this?

10:08.900 --> 10:11.819
Michelle, you told a lie.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.030
Yes, I did.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.243
Look, sweetheart, it's not

10:15.490 --> 10:18.243
very nice to tell lies.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.955
I'm sorry.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.955
I love the doggy.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.290
Yeah, well, I don't.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.711
Doggy, come back.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.465
Michelle, we don't want

10:28.753 --> 10:31.465
a dog livin' in the house.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.468
- Yes, we do.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.468
- No, we don't.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.220
- Yes, we do.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.220
- No, we don't.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.013
Yes, we do.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.641
Aw.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.689
My leopard underwear!

10:48.731 --> 10:50.650
That's why we don't.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.235
Hey, get that..

10:52.277 --> 10:54.112
That's my favorite pair, you..

10:54.154 --> 10:55.905
Run, doggy. Run, doggy!

10:58.492 --> 11:01.495
And another thing about our

10:58.492 --> 11:01.495
friend is her name is Minnie.

11:01.536 --> 11:04.498
- Isn't that a nice name, dad?

11:01.536 --> 11:04.498
- That's a lovely name.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.957
Is your new friend a mouse?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.043
No, but you're getting warmer.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.713
Oh!

11:12.755 --> 11:15.008
Daddy, we'd like you

11:12.755 --> 11:15.008
to meet Minnie.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.135
We've met.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.598
Oh, look, dad.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.598
Minnie's crazy about you.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.475
She loves to hug.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.268
This is your kind of dog.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.979
My kind of dog is

11:25.310 --> 11:27.979
on a bun with mustard.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.816
Joey said if nobody wants her,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.816
we can keep her.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.528
Why on earth

11:32.817 --> 11:34.528
would Joey say that

11:34.569 --> 11:37.489
without talking

11:34.569 --> 11:37.489
to me first, Joey?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.407
Well, she wandered

11:37.531 --> 11:39.407
into the backyard

11:39.449 --> 11:40.659
we shared a sandwich

11:40.699 --> 11:42.076
and, well, look at that face.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.703
- She's so cute.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.703
- Yeah, sure, she's cute to you.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.999
You-you don't have doggy slobber

11:44.745 --> 11:47.999
all over your pillow.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.419
- Danny, get rid of the mutt.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.419
- Can't we keep Minnie, please?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.505
- Please?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.216
[whimpering]

11:58.051 --> 12:01.596
People, don't be fooled

11:58.051 --> 12:01.596
by that look of innocence.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.391
Underneath is a jungle beast

12:01.638 --> 12:04.391
just thinking

12:04.432 --> 12:05.600
"Here's a nice clean house

12:05.642 --> 12:08.395
that I can totally destroy."

12:08.436 --> 12:10.355
Trust me, that thing is gonna

12:08.436 --> 12:10.355
track mud into the house

12:10.397 --> 12:11.772
it's gonna chew everything up

12:11.814 --> 12:14.275
and they're very

12:11.814 --> 12:14.275
difficult to house train.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.528
So was Michelle,

12:14.317 --> 12:16.528
but we kept her.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.948
I'm sorry, but I do not

12:18.029 --> 12:20.948
want a dog in this house.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.950
That's right.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.950
And what Danny says, goes.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.870
He's the boss and that's

12:22.992 --> 12:25.870
the way things work and that's..

12:25.912 --> 12:27.664
When did I become

12:25.912 --> 12:27.664
your faithful sidekick?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.333
[whimpering]

12:32.419 --> 12:35.129
Something's wrong with Minnie.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.051
(D.J.)

12:36.797 --> 12:40.051
'Uh-oh, her tummy's fat,

12:36.797 --> 12:40.051
and she's panting heavy.'

12:41.177 --> 12:43.680
Kimmy's dog acted

12:41.177 --> 12:43.680
the same way

12:43.722 --> 12:45.640
right before she had puppies.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.729
She's gonna have puppies

12:50.769 --> 12:52.439
in my living room?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.524
I'm gonna be an aunt!

12:54.566 --> 12:56.234
Yes!

12:58.236 --> 12:59.696
I'll go call Kimmy.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.406
I don't know what..

13:04.117 --> 13:05.826
[instrumental music]

13:07.621 --> 13:09.080
This dog is in labor.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.082
- Danny, do somethin'.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.082
- Why me?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.626
'Cause you're the only one

13:11.124 --> 13:12.626
who had kids.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.503
Not in the living room.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.217
Hey, what's goin' on?

13:21.259 --> 13:22.719
Minnie's having puppies.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.345
[gasps]

13:22.761 --> 13:24.345
No!

13:25.597 --> 13:26.973
Thank you, Mrs. Gibbler.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.643
Okay, Kimmy's mom

13:27.014 --> 13:29.643
told me what we need.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.978
Dad, here's the number

13:29.684 --> 13:31.978
of the Gibbler's vet.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.773
Joey, you go find something for

13:32.019 --> 13:34.773
Minnie to have her puppies in.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.025
Stephanie, you and I will go

13:34.855 --> 13:38.025
get blankets and newspapers.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.902
And I'm gonna go study

13:38.067 --> 13:39.902
for my driving test.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.572
What does that have

13:41.112 --> 13:42.572
to do with Minnie?

13:42.614 --> 13:43.906
'Cause if I

13:42.614 --> 13:43.906
don't pass that test

13:43.948 --> 13:44.949
I'm gonna need her puppies

13:44.991 --> 13:46.909
to pull my sled around town.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.036
[instrumental music]

13:54.709 --> 13:56.795
[upbeat music over radio]

14:09.932 --> 14:12.101
What are you doing?

14:12.143 --> 14:14.145
Uh, studying for

14:12.143 --> 14:14.145
my driver's test.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.649
Is this how you

14:15.896 --> 14:17.649
studied last time?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.693
No, this time I got the book.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.113
D.J., I feel like

14:21.902 --> 14:24.113
I'm in high school again.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.491
I was never any good

14:24.155 --> 14:26.491
at studying for tests.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.326
Probably 'cause

14:26.533 --> 14:28.326
of the way you study.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.036
What's the matter

14:28.368 --> 14:30.036
with the way I study?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.831
Nothing, if you're taking

14:30.077 --> 14:32.831
a test on sink drumming.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.293
- First of all, no music.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.293
- No music?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.671
- And no food.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.671
- No chicken?

14:40.921 --> 14:43.800
And finally,

14:40.921 --> 14:43.800
sit in the chair..

14:43.842 --> 14:45.552
...with this book.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.261
There's nothing left

14:45.593 --> 14:47.261
to do but study.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.389
See, you're getting

14:47.303 --> 14:49.389
smarter already.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.934
- You guys missed it!

14:51.307 --> 14:53.934
- What, Minnie had her puppies?

14:53.976 --> 14:57.814
No, she sat up in her box

14:53.976 --> 14:57.814
and went, "Where's my water?"

14:57.856 --> 14:58.815
Get out!

14:58.857 --> 15:01.317
[whimpering]

15:01.359 --> 15:03.361
When something real happens,

15:01.359 --> 15:03.361
let me know.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.488
[growling]

15:07.907 --> 15:09.826
Come on, Uncle Jesse,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.826
I'll help you learn this stuff.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.619
Thanks. That's

15:09.868 --> 15:11.619
very nice of you.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.120
Hey, you need your license

15:13.162 --> 15:15.498
and I need a ride

15:13.162 --> 15:15.498
to the mall tomorrow.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.292
- Alright, let's do it.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.292
- Okay.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.419
Puppy update.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.879
I called the animal shelter.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.380
Nobody reported Minnie lost yet

15:22.422 --> 15:24.382
but we'll keep trying

15:22.422 --> 15:24.382
to find her owner.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.009
Daddy, how did Minnie

15:24.424 --> 15:27.009
make her puppies?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.181
Well, sweetheart

15:32.223 --> 15:35.142
I was hoping you'd

15:32.223 --> 15:35.142
ask me that.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.646
Remember when we talked about

15:35.184 --> 15:38.646
how it takes a mommy

15:38.688 --> 15:40.981
and a daddy to make a baby?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.024
Yeah.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.360
Well, it takes a mommy dog

15:44.402 --> 15:46.946
and a daddy dog

15:44.402 --> 15:46.946
to make a puppy dog.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.616
Oh, thanks.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.076
I'm always happy

15:49.657 --> 15:52.076
to answer your questions.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.579
Good, because

15:52.118 --> 15:54.579
I have another one.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.623
Oh-ho, goody gumdrops.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.959
How do you think

15:57.832 --> 15:59.959
Minnie met her husband?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.754
I like that question.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.800
Steph, some time ago

16:06.841 --> 16:09.510
in a far away land

16:06.841 --> 16:09.510
called Ohio..

16:11.178 --> 16:14.181
...Minnie was taking a little

16:11.178 --> 16:14.181
walk by the fire station.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.518
And the firehouse dog, Arnie,

16:14.223 --> 16:17.518
he took one look at Minnie

16:17.560 --> 16:20.730
and he went "Bow wow wow."

16:21.606 --> 16:23.357
It was love at first sniff.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.027
'And then on one special day'

16:27.069 --> 16:29.823
Arnie got down on three knees..

16:29.864 --> 16:32.992
...and he said,

16:29.864 --> 16:32.992
"Minnie, marry me.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.161
You make my tail wag."

16:37.037 --> 16:38.832
That was so romantic.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.250
Daddy, how do you

16:38.873 --> 16:41.250
know all this stuff?

16:41.292 --> 16:44.838
Well, I'm your dad,

16:41.292 --> 16:44.838
so I know everything.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.006
And when I don't know,

16:44.879 --> 16:47.006
I make up.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.844
- I thought so.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.844
- Come here.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.306
[Michelle panting]

17:01.020 --> 17:03.773
Well, it looks like

17:01.020 --> 17:03.773
Minnie found a Lamaze coach.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.196
Hey, everybody, I think

17:07.652 --> 17:10.196
something's gonna happen.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.448
- What's going on?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.448
- What?

17:12.490 --> 17:15.075
Hey, get in the box.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.075
Get in the box.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.997
Not you.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.167
You better not be going

17:21.165 --> 17:23.167
where I think you're going.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.337
Stop! Heel! Sit!

17:27.254 --> 17:28.798
Not on my bed, huh?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.258
Danny, do somethin' about this.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.844
This is not my fault.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.053
Joey let the dog in the house

17:34.094 --> 17:35.638
and it got the girls

17:34.094 --> 17:35.638
all worked up.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.390
Hey, if you weren't

17:35.680 --> 17:37.390
such a neat freak

17:37.431 --> 17:38.641
we would've already had a dog

17:38.683 --> 17:40.560
that would've

17:38.683 --> 17:40.560
chased this dog away.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
Dad, we'll clean up

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
after Minnie.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.771
You'll never know she's here.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.315
I'll know she's here.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.315
She's having puppies on my bed.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.568
You don't know

17:46.357 --> 17:48.568
how lucky you are.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.777
Lucky to have puppies on my bed?

17:49.819 --> 17:52.572
[indistinct chatter]

17:52.613 --> 17:54.991
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.367
Here comes a puppy.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.453
Whoa, baby!

18:01.789 --> 18:03.123
This is the most amazing thing

18:03.165 --> 18:04.500
that's ever happened in my bed.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.129
(Stephanie)

18:06.044 --> 18:09.129
'Look, she's cleaning off

18:06.044 --> 18:09.129
the puppy.'

18:09.171 --> 18:11.257
How does she know what to do?

18:11.298 --> 18:14.010
Well, it's part

18:11.298 --> 18:14.010
of nature, Steph.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.554
Nature is so awesome.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.722
I can't believe

18:16.596 --> 18:17.722
we were just fightin'

18:17.764 --> 18:19.306
about Minnie having puppies.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.142
This is so beautiful.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.477
It all makes you think about

18:23.519 --> 18:26.105
what's really important

18:23.519 --> 18:26.105
in life, doesn't it?

18:26.146 --> 18:28.399
Yeah, like being able

18:26.146 --> 18:28.399
to share this moment

18:28.441 --> 18:30.109
with people

18:28.441 --> 18:30.109
you really love.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.948
(D.J.)

18:32.445 --> 18:34.948
'Ah, this is so incredible.'

18:34.989 --> 18:37.075
Yesterday these puppies

18:34.989 --> 18:37.075
weren't even here

18:37.116 --> 18:38.993
and now they are.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.328
And seeing them being born..

18:41.370 --> 18:42.914
...it's like watching a miracle.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.334
I'm so glad

18:44.665 --> 18:47.334
you girls could see this.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.836
Now maybe you can understand

18:48.878 --> 18:51.130
how I felt the day

18:48.878 --> 18:51.130
each of you were born.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.841
My three little miracles.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.846
- How cute.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.846
- It's so little.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.180
Yeah, they're tiny.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.267
Why'd you pick my bed?

19:04.852 --> 19:07.105
Can you watch

19:04.852 --> 19:07.105
the drooling, please?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.231
[instrumental music]

19:18.240 --> 19:20.326
[instrumental music]

19:25.123 --> 19:27.207
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

19:30.461 --> 19:31.921
Oh, man, I've got enough fur

19:31.963 --> 19:33.840
in this thing

19:31.963 --> 19:33.840
to build another dog.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.010
Minnie's owner just showed up.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.886
He's here.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.054
I'm sorry, girls.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.806
It's time to

19:40.096 --> 19:41.806
bring in the troops.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.851
- 'Come on, Minnie.'

19:41.848 --> 19:44.851
- 'Here we go, puppies.'

19:46.393 --> 19:48.813
(Joey)

19:46.393 --> 19:48.813
'Okay.'

19:48.855 --> 19:50.439
'Okay.'

19:50.481 --> 19:53.026
We got bachelor number one.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.612
Aw, look, oh,

19:53.067 --> 19:56.612
bachelor number two.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.615
Okay, bachelor number three

19:56.654 --> 19:59.615
is right here.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.575
Bachelor number four. Hi.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.370
Look what I just

20:02.910 --> 20:04.370
found in my bed.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.456
A four-legged ankle-biter.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.836
Uh, hi, I-I'm Frank Flood.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.505
Minnie! Minnie.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.505
Oh, Minnie.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.632
Come over here.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.632
Give me a kiss. Oh.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.259
Thank you for taking

20:16.674 --> 20:19.259
such good care of Minnie

20:19.301 --> 20:21.554
and her puppies.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.182
She was really lucky

20:21.595 --> 20:24.182
to find such nice people.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.018
Well, we were really lucky

20:24.223 --> 20:27.018
to find such a sweet dog.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.477
She sheds like crazy but..

20:28.519 --> 20:31.105
...I guess that's not

20:28.519 --> 20:31.105
really her fault, huh?

20:31.147 --> 20:32.606
Truth is, if you

20:31.147 --> 20:32.606
hadn't come to claim her

20:32.648 --> 20:34.316
we probably would've

20:32.648 --> 20:34.316
kept them all right here.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.611
Oh, I can't wait to get

20:34.358 --> 20:37.611
those little guys home.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.364
I'll never, ever,

20:37.653 --> 20:40.364
ever, ever forget you.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.075
Bye, Minnie.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.492
Say, uh, Frank, uh..

20:43.534 --> 20:44.869
...would you mind

20:43.534 --> 20:44.869
if I drive the girls over

20:44.911 --> 20:46.328
once in a while

20:44.911 --> 20:46.328
to visit the puppies.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.164
I'll tell you what.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.374
How would you like to keep

20:48.206 --> 20:50.374
one of Minnie's puppies?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.668
Would we? Could we?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.545
Yeah, dad, can we?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.214
You guys know

20:54.587 --> 20:56.214
how I feel about dogs.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.550
You just said you wouldn't

20:56.255 --> 20:59.550
mind keeping all of them.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.053
Well, that was when I thought

20:59.592 --> 21:02.053
the dogs were leaving.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.598
We promise

21:03.137 --> 21:05.598
we'll take care of it.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.017
Come on, Danny. I've wanted

21:05.639 --> 21:08.017
a dog my whole life.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.562
Oh, look at that face.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.526
Danny, be strong.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.861
Think dirt.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.073
I can't help it, I'm wimping.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.283
Look at that face.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.041
Alright, we can have a puppy.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.834
(in unison)

21:32.083 --> 21:33.834
Yeah!

21:33.876 --> 21:35.711
- Thank you.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.711
- Hooray.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.380
Michelle, you pick

21:35.753 --> 21:38.380
the puppy.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.008
I love this puppy!

21:42.301 --> 21:44.344
The one that likes my bed?

21:47.223 --> 21:48.307
- Okay.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.307
- Here's a new addition.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.558
- Thanks.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.558
- You're welcome.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.601
Thank you for coming, Frank.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.852
Thanks for all your help.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.647
Are you kidding?

21:51.894 --> 21:54.647
It was our pleasure.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.315
- You got one?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.315
- Yeah, I got one.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.902
Okay. Go, baby. Okay.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.902
Okay, hold on.
