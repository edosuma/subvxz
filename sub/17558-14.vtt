WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:08.409
Oh, good, you're doing nothing.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.677
I'm watching the playoffs.

00:09.710 --> 00:10.711
That's what you said
last Sunday.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.979
Hey...

00:12.012 --> 00:13.581
Anyway, I've been kicking
around some ideas

00:13.614 --> 00:15.049
for birth announcements.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.551
I just need you to sign off
on one more thing.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.621
I'm sure whatever you want
is fine, it's...

00:22.223 --> 00:23.991
What the hell is that?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.560
It's his wardrobe for the
Christening announcement photo.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.330
Oh, no.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.165
My son is not wearing that.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.434
Oh, no, no, no-- if you're
afraid it's derivative,

00:33.467 --> 00:34.568
it is intentionally so.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.237
It is modeled after
Lucy Harker's funeral gown

00:36.270 --> 00:38.339
from Francis Ford Coppola's
Dracula.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.075
Good eye, David.
My son is not wearing
a dress, Bryan.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.343
It is not a dress.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.578
It is a classic turn of
the century dressing gown.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.081
They were very common infant
attire and a lot of parents

00:47.115 --> 00:48.749
still use them in birth
and Christening announcements.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.518
I'm just kind of hoping
to get to his first birthday

00:50.551 --> 00:51.752
without him being
called "a baby homo."

00:51.785 --> 00:54.122
Who would call an infant
"a baby homo"

00:54.155 --> 00:56.524
except for a toddler
Michele Bachmann?

00:56.557 --> 01:00.094
David, clothes do not
define what somebody is.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.629
I mean, look at me.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.197
If you had to pick what
my sexuality was

01:03.231 --> 01:05.099
based on what I was wearing,
what would you say?

01:05.133 --> 01:07.034
Lesbian Bagger Vance.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.203
I love the way you dress,
I'm just saying we have

01:09.237 --> 01:11.372
to be careful about what kind
of impression we put out there.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.374
Meaning what?
Meaning that
people make snap judgments

01:13.407 --> 01:14.475
based on appearances

01:14.508 --> 01:16.410
and it could affect him
for the rest of his life.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.247
Fine, if you don't
like my idea,

01:19.280 --> 01:20.581
come up with one
of your own.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.391
Hello.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.759
Welcome.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.061
Jane Forrest,
exquisite properties

01:34.094 --> 01:35.129
for appropriate buyers.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.097
My God, it's dead in here.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.267
It's more like
a haunted open house.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.735
And you must be
one of the ghosts.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.137
Judging by your outfit,

01:43.171 --> 01:45.139
I'd say you died around
the time Argo was set.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.241
I am dressed as what I am,

01:47.275 --> 01:48.809
which is a damn good
real estate agent.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.811
Now, are you here
to view the property

01:50.844 --> 01:53.147
or just to air out those
dazzling new tooth caps

01:53.181 --> 01:55.283
of yours?
Oh, relax Janey, I'm Brice.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.817
Nancy Niles'
broker associate.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.520
She sent me here to check out
your first open house.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.290
Let's see.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.326
You see that? I just...
I just cruised myself.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.594
I am literally a Greek god.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.795
Tell me, does this

02:07.828 --> 02:09.463
pant make my package
look too big?

02:09.497 --> 02:12.700
Certainly pales in comparison
to the size of your ego.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.302
Now, thank you
very much, Price...

02:14.335 --> 02:17.305
Brice-- as in Dallas Howard.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.606
So, Jane, tell me.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.341
Where'd you get your start
in real estate?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.609
Ohio.
Right.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.810
And I bet the smell

02:22.843 --> 02:23.811
of these cookies baked
fresh from a tube

02:23.844 --> 02:25.213
is your secret weapon?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.647
Yes.
No.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.816
See, here in L.A. it's just
a reminder of your client's

02:28.849 --> 02:30.150
eating disorder, but see

02:30.184 --> 02:31.619
that is not what's
driving people

02:31.652 --> 02:32.686
away from your open house.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.189
Okay, I'll bite--
what is?

02:35.223 --> 02:37.791
Well, we could quickly slap
on a fresh coat of paint,

02:37.825 --> 02:41.729
but I think the real problem
lies within the foundation.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.698
I mean, the whole design scheme
is so tacky and outdated.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.535
Are you insane? We can't
flip an entire house.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.538
Keep up with me, honey-- I'm
not talking about the house.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.473
I'm flipping you.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.575
It was so nice
meeting you, Shania.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.743
I hope you had fun
on the set tour,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.645
though I don't normally

02:57.678 --> 02:59.313
give it myself. (laughs)

02:59.347 --> 03:00.814
There are special
privileges that come

03:00.848 --> 03:02.816
with being the kid of
my boss's surrogate.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.652
You don't have any more
children, do you?

03:04.685 --> 03:05.519
Oh, no.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.187
Okay, see you guys later.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.723
Hey, girls, hate to interrupt
but picture's up in ten

03:09.757 --> 03:11.659
and our star needs
to be touched up.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.394
Oily faces don't
powder themselves.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.395
No, they don't.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.929
Bye.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.367
Oh, how do I look?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.368
Great.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.669
Is there something
in my teeth?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.604
How's my breath?
Did you eat bologna?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.606
That's Chris.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.607
He's a grip.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.276
What's a grip?
Got me.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.277
We have a bit of
a thing going.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.379
Oh, um, what about Darnell?

03:31.412 --> 03:33.681
I thought you guys
were hot and heavy.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.583
Well, when things got intimate,
Darnell kept taking

03:35.616 --> 03:37.518
the bus downtown,
which I do like,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.420
but he never got off
at the right stop.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.855
He kept taking it all
the way to skid row.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.791
I couldn't look him
in the eye anymore,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.559
you know what I'm saying?
Not at all.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.928
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.264
Hey. Kisses--
mm-wah, mm-wah.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.900
Two things-- number one,
you look stupid fierce.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.235
Number two, we have
a date-- Mary J. Blige

03:55.269 --> 03:57.805
is playing at the Nokia,
no is not an option, and...

03:57.838 --> 03:59.239
No more drama.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.874
(both laughing)

04:00.908 --> 04:03.311
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to these two lovely ladies?

04:03.344 --> 04:04.445
Oh, Chris, these
are my friends.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.879
This is Goldie
and Shania.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.781
I bet you break boys' hearts
left and right.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.383
Don't you know it, girlfriend?

04:09.417 --> 04:11.218
We should go out
boy-hunting sometime.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.221
GOLDIE (laughs):
Isn't she precocious?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.323
She taught me that word
when she was four.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.757
Yeah, well,
I better get back to work.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.858
I got a jib arm to rig.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.830
What was that, saying
you want to go hunting

04:22.863 --> 04:24.565
for boys with my boyfriend?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.733
Rocky, I was kidding.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.435
I'm too young
to get into gay bars.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.502
(bell rings)

04:28.536 --> 04:30.003
MAN:
All right, picture's up.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.475
Okay, we want
to upgrade her look.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.410
But I don't want
anything crazy.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.611
Crazy is what
you've got, girl.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.313
BRICE:
I know, it's so
brittle, I just want

04:39.347 --> 04:40.581
to snap it off,
boil it in water

04:40.614 --> 04:41.582
and put marinara on it.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.283
Baby, the way
your tongue works.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.985
You don't know the half.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.656
Maybe you just try adding
a little texture and swing.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.757
It looks hot on my wife.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.459
It's easy to wear
it down for work.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.462
Or tie it up for chasing
our kids around the house.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.764
HAIRSTYLIST:
I say we do some
subtle layering.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.866
Something to highlight
your great jaw line.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.869
Natasha, I never noticed
how soft you hair is.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.971
Don't let me leave without
the name of your conditioner.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.339
And your phone number.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.874
(laughs)

05:06.907 --> 05:08.308
What are you doing?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.478
Hopefully getting
her number.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.979
And it's a game?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.947
Oh, sweetheart, it's
definitely a game.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.783
Uh-huh, to what end?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.385
To what...
I don't know.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.354
Go to dinner, a movie,
or see where the night takes us.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.956
I have a boat.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.525
Are you even thinking about her?

05:24.558 --> 05:25.959
What about her feelings?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.361
What if she likes you?

05:27.395 --> 05:28.996
Is it the fumes in here?

05:29.029 --> 05:31.532
I know Rayburn uses a
two-step emulsifying bleach.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.367
Please, I know you, Brice.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.803
I was married to a man
just like you.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.639
And I think you are cruel
and you are selfish.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.541
And if you were
a decent human being,

05:40.574 --> 05:42.042
you would leave
that young girl alone

05:42.075 --> 05:43.677
and stick to your own kind.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.379
What's my own kind?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.515
Gay.
I'm not gay.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.817
Oh, please,
you are wearing a bracelet.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.919
Jane, it's a new world.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.654
Just because a guy's
into fashion and culture

05:53.687 --> 05:55.656
and hair processing
doesn't make him gay.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.824
Hear, hear.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.860
Oh...

06:00.861 --> 06:02.029
I mean,
what is David's problem?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.831
That's a perfectly
lovely gown

06:03.864 --> 06:05.566
for a boy or a girl.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.536
Um, I think I might have to
side with David on this one.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.405
It's a little... girly?

06:11.439 --> 06:13.674
Well, so what? I mean,
clothing doesn't necessarily

06:13.707 --> 06:15.342
have to indicate gender.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.845
Right, but, um...
most people aren't that evolved.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.079
They go with their
first impressions

06:19.112 --> 06:20.514
and sometimes that can hurt.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.382
(knocking on door)

06:23.784 --> 06:24.918
I need to talk
to the child.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.721
Child, you have
lost your damn

06:27.755 --> 06:31.792
stinking mind suggesting that my
boyfriend Chris is a homosexual.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.695
Oh, so he's secretly gay,
but dates women as a cover?

06:34.728 --> 06:35.963
You know, on the down low?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.866
What? The down low?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.401
My man is on the up high--
he is straight.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.770
I'm sure you think he is, Rocky,

06:42.803 --> 06:45.606
but my gaydar
is pretty impeccable.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.481
Yes, Miss Shania?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.483
Diego, I wanted
to tell you.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.885
Despite how difficult it
must be in your community

06:57.918 --> 06:59.386
to proudly declare
who you are,

06:59.419 --> 07:00.454
I know.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.555
¿Cómo?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.491
I know the hanky
in your left pocket

07:03.524 --> 07:04.892
is part of the gay hanky code.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.729
Well, I just, uh, use it to wipe
my sweat when I trim the bushes.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.830
Okay, we'll go with that.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.732
Here, I got you this.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.634
It's Bryan's screener
for Les Miz.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.170
Maybe you know someone
who'd enjoy watching it.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.477
I just know on, like,
a molecular level.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.679
Sorry, Rocky,
but Chris is gay.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.817
Ooh, Jane, what's with
the scarf? Chemo?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.619
My hair is not thinning,

07:31.652 --> 07:32.953
if that's what
you're implying.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.623
Why is Rocky sweating?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.825
Oh, well, Shania accused
Rocky's boyfriend

07:37.858 --> 07:39.693
of being gay...
which he is not.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.929
And we were just, uh,
clearing up the situation.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.997
I am going through
this exact same thing

07:44.031 --> 07:45.432
with this fellow at work.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.867
Well, it's not as easy
to tell who's gay

07:46.900 --> 07:48.435
and who's straight anymore.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.037
If I'm confused, I can't imagine
how you straights feel.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.171
Well, Chris is straight.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.640
Well, your not-gay,

07:52.673 --> 07:53.641
gay boyfriend
can't be

07:53.674 --> 07:54.808
any gayer than gay Brice.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.043
Why do you even care?

07:56.076 --> 07:58.045
I need to find out if I
should like him or hate him.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.947
And make him deal
with his life choices

07:59.980 --> 08:01.549
so he doesn't hurt
innocent women.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.650
Like me.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.051
Ooh, what if
we have a dinner,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.786
and then we can
put these guys

08:05.819 --> 08:07.688
to a gay test--
like a game show.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.122
Whoo-hoo!
Well, I'm in.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.524
Because I know I'm gonna win.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.060
Okay, I'll do anything
to find out the truth.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.862
If this works,
I can repackage it

08:14.895 --> 08:16.463
with has-beens
and then sell it to Fox.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.497
Beach house!

08:22.202 --> 08:23.470
I found the perfect

08:23.503 --> 08:26.574
outfit for the birth
announcement picture.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.408
(imitates fanfare)

08:28.441 --> 08:30.477
Huh? I was gonna get

08:30.510 --> 08:31.679
a little mouth guard,
but then I realized

08:31.712 --> 08:33.513
he's not gonna have
any teeth to protect, so...

08:33.547 --> 08:35.683
(sighs):
Well, it beats the dress.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.918
It's not a dress, it's a gown.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.319
And there's a difference.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.321
Yeah, one is for girls,
the other's for gays.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.355
Wow.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.824
I'm just trying
to live my life.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.825
I didn't realize I was

08:44.858 --> 08:45.859
living it with a homophobe.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.527
That's not what I meant, Bry.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.496
I'm just saying,
it's gonna be weird enough

08:49.529 --> 08:50.698
for some people to receive
a birth announcement

08:50.731 --> 08:51.832
with two dads on it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.400
Oh, my God, David.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.902
If you're so concerned

08:54.935 --> 08:56.604
about what other
people might think,

08:56.637 --> 08:58.271
I'll just write
on the back of it,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.440
"It's just a gown.
He's not gay.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.709
"At least, not yet.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.443
We'll check back
at puberty."

09:03.476 --> 09:05.545
Please, don't even
joke about that.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.347
All the people
who judge us

09:07.380 --> 09:09.516
will get on their soapboxes
and say, "See?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.851
"He was surrounded
by so much gay,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.219
it probably rubbed off on him."

09:12.252 --> 09:13.420
Just like my parents
surrounded me

09:13.453 --> 09:15.422
with all their straightness,
and it rubbed off on me?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.290
It doesn't work
that way, David.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.959
Yeah, but you know
how the world is.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.293
People like to condemn

09:20.327 --> 09:21.862
the things they
don't understand.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
There was this...

09:23.931 --> 09:25.232
(sighs)

09:25.265 --> 09:28.501
...kid on my junior
high mock U.N. team.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.638
I called him a fag,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.439
'cause I was afraid

09:32.472 --> 09:33.741
that people would call me that.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.776
'Cause even back then,

09:35.809 --> 09:37.477
I knew that I was one.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.913
I hope...

09:39.947 --> 09:42.883
our son won't
experience the same

09:42.916 --> 09:46.253
pain and humiliation
and exclusion that we did.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.387
David,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.256
I'm not concerned about that,

09:49.289 --> 09:50.423
because I do believe

09:50.457 --> 09:52.459
that a kid's parents
rub off on them.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.662
But the things that are gonna
rub off on our kids

09:54.695 --> 09:56.329
are things like strength

09:56.363 --> 09:58.498
and tolerance and love.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.769
(doorbell rings)

10:01.802 --> 10:03.771
Can we talk more
about this later?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.472
Sure.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.943
*

10:09.977 --> 10:12.612
Good evening, and welcome to...

10:12.646 --> 10:14.948
BOTH:
"Gay or Not Gay?!"

10:14.982 --> 10:16.650
(Rocky laughs)

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
Yeah, are you guys sure
this is a good idea?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.387
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.662
(sighs)

10:29.529 --> 10:31.298
Jane.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.033
Oh, my Lord,

10:33.066 --> 10:34.367
you look

10:34.401 --> 10:36.403
amazing.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
I do not use the word "fabulous"

10:39.840 --> 10:41.041
very often...

10:41.074 --> 10:42.609
Okay, maybe I do.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.845
But I've never meant it
more than I do right now.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.646
Really? I feel

10:46.680 --> 10:48.816
so unladylike
in these clothes.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.517
It's too late to go
home and change, right?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.352
Boys are coming soon. Okay.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.321
(mouths)

10:54.354 --> 10:55.956
How does the gay test work?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.991
Okay, we've devised
a series of tests

10:58.025 --> 10:59.693
to see which way your men sway.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.862
The first topic we're gonna
throw at them is...

11:01.895 --> 11:03.697
Female Oscar winners.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.965
Dead giveaway.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.834
Here you go.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.335
That's very
gentlemanly of you.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.403
If you knew what
I was thinking
about your new look,

11:10.437 --> 11:11.671
you wouldn't call me
a gentleman.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.007
You look hot
as hell, Jane.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.043
Now that seemed like genuine
boy-girl stuff to me.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.544
What's your man-tenna
picking up?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.546
I need more time.

11:19.579 --> 11:24.852
Okay, guys, we have Bryan's
famous Gruyère crisps

11:24.885 --> 11:27.420
with a truffled-lobster paste.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.023
ALL: Ooh!
BRYAN:
I'm a great cook.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.726
Diet starts tomorrow.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.863
Beep-beep-beep-beep.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.530
Aren't you allergic?

11:37.564 --> 11:40.000
Speaking of allergies, I about
busted out in hives when I saw

11:40.033 --> 11:42.369
what Diablo Cody was
wearing to the 2008 Oscars.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.370
Anybody remember?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.504
Oh, my God,

11:44.537 --> 11:45.906
that floor-length
cheetah-print frock?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.508
She looked like a thrift store
sofa with tattoos.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.577
Hmm. Welcome to
the jungle, honey.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.679
Very confusing.
He took the bait,

11:52.712 --> 11:55.048
but then he threw in that
reference to Guns N' Roses.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.116
To what?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.785
Never mind.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.053
Over salad, we'll initiate
round two of testing,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.022
based on gay men's
innate ability

12:02.055 --> 12:03.957
to identify any top ten song.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.893
Goldie, we'll need
your help with this.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.061
This green goddess dressing
is delicious,

12:08.095 --> 12:09.930
and Chris is delighted.
BRYAN: Oh.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.466
Oh, uh, I always enjoy music

12:13.500 --> 12:14.902
with my salad.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.037
Bryan, would you turn on
the radio?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.472
Wait, Mom,
I brought my recorder.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.141
Would you like
to hear me play it?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.777
Great idea! Wait. I know.
Let's make a game out of it.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.478
Name That Tune!

12:25.512 --> 12:27.147
Yay!
Oh, play it.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.748
(plays two notes)
"Diamonds."

12:28.782 --> 12:30.918
By Rihanna.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.753
Come on. It was two notes.
It could be any song.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.655
It could,
but it isn't.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.557
He's right.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.758
(laughing)

12:40.460 --> 12:42.529
That Rihanna.
is so hot.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.799
And then, for dessert,

12:45.833 --> 12:49.169
we'll retire to the parlor
for a rousing game of Celebrity!

12:49.202 --> 12:50.737
Celebrity?
What's that?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.073
Celebrity is a guessing game,
where you draw names out

12:53.106 --> 12:54.741
of an orange Bauer cookie jar,
and then you try

12:54.774 --> 12:56.443
to get your teammates to guess
the names that you're holding.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.744
Bryan and I
will stack the deck

12:57.777 --> 13:00.047
with some very gay-centric
personalities.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.950
All right, Brice, Chris,

13:02.983 --> 13:04.517
our team is up, let's do it.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.653
You guys are going down. Watch a
professional.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.921
Here we go.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.122
Shania, whenever you are ready.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.190
All right, here we go.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.658
All right, this guy
is an artist

13:11.691 --> 13:13.093
or a photographer...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.661
BOTH: Robert Mapplethorpe!
Yes.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.529
Okay, what do we got?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.665
I don't know who this person is.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.201
First name starts with,
is like "kanga..."

13:21.234 --> 13:22.535
Rue!
McClanahan!

13:22.569 --> 13:24.104
Yes! Bam!

13:24.137 --> 13:28.108
Okay, all right, this is
the daughter of someone.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.877
Liza Minnelli.
Lourdes Ciccone.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.544
It was Lourdes.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.980
That's amazing.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.781
Okay, oh, this one's easy,
this one's mine.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.650
This was the quarterback for the
Aggies, Heisman Trophy winner.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.152
Johnny Manziel.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.488
Time.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.822
Okay, so after all that,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.492
what if the data
is inconclusive?

13:45.525 --> 13:46.659
There is one, final test.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.129
It is absolutely 100% accurate.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.563
But it is so horrible

13:50.597 --> 13:51.999
to make a man sit through
if he's not gay.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.168
I will only break this out
as an absolute last resort.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.171
Oprah's Legends Ball.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.807
No straight male has ever
sat through an entire viewing

14:00.840 --> 14:03.576
without his body shutting down
to protect itself.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.046
And, oh, yes, there
will be Cicely Tyson.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.181
Ay, dios mio.
Look at them sitting there

14:08.215 --> 14:11.018
in their Sunday best
on Oprah's front lawn!

14:11.051 --> 14:13.253
Ooh! Miss Leontyne Price.
Work it, girl.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.555
Phylicia Rashad,
I wish you were my mom!

14:15.588 --> 14:17.590
Get off the screen,
Maria Shriver!

14:17.624 --> 14:18.858
Ooh, this is my favorite part.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.828
They pass the microphone
to Miss Patti LaBelle!

14:21.861 --> 14:22.996
Sing it, girl!
Sing it!

14:23.030 --> 14:24.697
It is over!
Ah!

14:24.731 --> 14:26.199
I'm gonna get
a teensy brandy.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.036
Oh, Lena Horne,
you're alive!

14:29.069 --> 14:30.203
It looks like
your fella's

14:30.237 --> 14:32.605
waving the rainbow flag
in surrender.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.041
We don't know that
for sure, Jane.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.276
Miss Della Reese. Mm!

14:36.309 --> 14:38.078
Why don't you just ask him,
Rocky?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.880
Yeah, isn't it more honest
than playing this silly game?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.882
I can't.
It's too hard.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.851
Oh, sing it, Diana, sing it.
(whispers): You look crazy.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.219
No, the gay test
is working.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.720
Let it play out.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.222
So that's what this is,
a bitch-hunt?

14:50.958 --> 14:53.060
Well, I already know what I am,
so I'm gonna go.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.861
(singing continues on video)

14:54.894 --> 14:55.963
Looking good, Gladys,

14:55.996 --> 14:58.831
looking good. Nice.
She's back on top.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.970
Brice?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.571
Please don't go.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.573
You know, Jane, I thought you
were sharp and funny, shrewd,

15:06.606 --> 15:08.608
with this new look of yours,
super sexy,

15:08.641 --> 15:10.944
but this little dinner party
you're throwing

15:10.978 --> 15:12.779
to find out if I'm gay?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.114
That's pathetic.

15:16.816 --> 15:21.588
(both mouthing)

15:21.621 --> 15:23.991
Aw, hell! Chris,
are you gay or straight?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.758
Am I what?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.227
Are you gay or straight?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.928
Because this game
we're playing

15:28.962 --> 15:31.731
isn't working and if we're
gonna be a thing,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.266
then I need to know. Now!

15:36.303 --> 15:39.106
Well, I don't think I care to
answer that question, Rocky.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.773
I will tell you this though:
you and I

15:40.807 --> 15:42.142
are most definitely
not a thing.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.044
Not anymore.
(snaps fingers)

15:51.018 --> 15:53.486
Goldie, I'm so sorry I
involved Shania in that
gaydar dinner last night.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.589
We hurt people's feelings and
we perpetuated ugly stereotypes.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.824
As an apology, please accept

15:57.857 --> 15:59.692
these French lavender macaroons
from Ladurée.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.793
Oh!

16:00.827 --> 16:02.529
Oh!

16:02.562 --> 16:04.597
Neh, neh, neh,
they're too beautiful to eat.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.999
SHANIA:
I'm so ashamed.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.600
I messed up Rocky's relationship
with Chris,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.769
and I might have
been wrong about him.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.505
Maybe I never really had an
amazing gaydar power at all.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.841
I'm going to write a letter
of apology on my blog

16:14.874 --> 16:16.043
to the city of Portland

16:16.076 --> 16:19.146
for describing its entire
female population as lesbian.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.681
That's very sweet, baby.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.150
It's a whole new sexually
ambiguous world

16:23.183 --> 16:24.551
out there,
and that's good.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.054
I mean, no one can be 100% sure
that I'm gay.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.624
Sure.
Yes.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.160
(speaks gibberish)
But I...

16:33.193 --> 16:34.627
Can I...?
Don't even...

16:34.661 --> 16:35.862
(muffled):
I'm sorry.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
(bell ringing)
MAN:
All right, that's a wrap, folks.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.733
Take an hour for lunch.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.705
Chris, what I did was wrong.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.208
I shouldn't have
lied to you about the
auspices of our dinner.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.543
I am truly sorry.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.047
I've got no right
to criticize you for lying.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.216
Rocky, I am gay.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.551
I don't say that aloud
too often,

16:58.585 --> 17:00.653
'cause look at this crew
I work with.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.888
It's like Duck Dynasty
up in here.

17:01.921 --> 17:06.093
And I didn't tell you 'cause
we were too busy having fun.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.729
But when I realized that you had
those kind of feelings for me,

17:09.762 --> 17:12.165
I didn't know how to tell
the truth without hurting you.

17:12.199 --> 17:16.203
Well, now that I know the truth,
I still want you in my life,

17:16.236 --> 17:18.605
but just not as a boyfriend.

17:19.306 --> 17:22.109
Can I still call you
"girlfriend"?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.077
Oh, I insist. And let
me tell you something:

17:24.111 --> 17:26.613
I am a producer of
Sing! and that means

17:26.646 --> 17:28.281
I contribute to the
order up in here.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.950
And if any person
makes you feel uncomfortable

17:30.983 --> 17:32.885
because of who you are,

17:32.919 --> 17:35.855
you run and tattle to me
and I will bring the justice.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.224
Okay.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.025
And also before the Mary J.
Blige concert tomorrow...

17:39.058 --> 17:40.727
Manis and pedis?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.095
Girl, calm down.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.630
We're doing dinner.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.697
I'd love that.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.765
Good. See you tomorrow.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.003
Girl, that ass
is still banging.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.713
(clears throat)
I heard you sold that
house on Glendower.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.982
Congratulations.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.052
Thank you.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.820
Anything else?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.289
No.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.960
Actually, yes.
Oh, yeah?

18:13.993 --> 18:16.296
Would you like some tips
on the best bars in Mykonos?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.665
Or maybe we could play
some Lady Gaga trivia.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.967
Or perhaps you're looking for
some tips on how to remove

18:21.000 --> 18:22.969
Merlot stains
out of skinny jeans?

18:23.002 --> 18:25.638
I wanted to say something to you
about last night.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.808
I wanted to say I was sorry

18:28.841 --> 18:30.743
and that what I did
was not kind.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.911
Then why did you do it?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.814
I needed to know if you were gay
or straight.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.016
Oh, my God, you are so quick
to judge everyone.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.152
You want to label everyone up
against some old stereotype.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.121
You are the most
stereotypical person
I've ever met in my life.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.191
What do you care what anyone is?
Why do you care what I am?

18:44.224 --> 18:46.326
Because I like you.
Because I'm d...

18:46.359 --> 18:48.695
I'm drawn to you.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.200
I really loved my husband,
Edgar.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.001
I really did.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.669
We had the best
time together.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.805
We would go
to the theater,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.308
we would discover
new bistros.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.810
I was so attracted
to all that.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.216
But Edgar was not attracted...
to me.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.120
And I do not want to make
that same mistake twice.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.789
Jane, the world has changed.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.691
It's not black and white
anymore.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.027
Well, maybe it's just too much
change for me.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.397
(knocks on desk)

19:24.431 --> 19:25.732
Sit down.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.369
I can help you change
your hair,

19:29.402 --> 19:31.838
I can help you
change your outfit,

19:31.871 --> 19:34.807
but only you can
change yourself.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.476
The question you
have to ask is

19:36.509 --> 19:39.479
do you want to hold onto the way
things used to be and be right,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.014
or do you want to
change and be happy?

19:50.357 --> 19:51.891
You still think I'm gay?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.526
(moans)

19:55.962 --> 19:57.697
I don't care.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.536
So, I have been thinking about
the outfit

20:03.570 --> 20:05.705
our baby will wear
for the birth announcement.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.541
Oh, sweetie, I really don't
want this to be a whole thing.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.244
So he can wear whatever
you want him to wear.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.350
What made you change your mind?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.618
That silly dinner party.

20:18.651 --> 20:22.188
Last night, I became that kid
from junior high all over again.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.691
Judging someone because I was
afraid of being judged.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.293
It wasn't just you.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.727
It was Shania, too.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.362
(chuckles)

20:29.396 --> 20:32.231
If we don't change,
if we don't evolve, then we die.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.701
You don't see any theropod
dinosaurs hanging around

20:34.734 --> 20:36.803
anymore, do you?
You want to know why?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.204
Because dromaeosauridae...

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
Oh, my God, David,
it's like you want me

20:40.273 --> 20:42.442
to stop paying attention.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.812
I just don't want our son

20:45.845 --> 20:48.147
to grow up the way that I did:

20:48.180 --> 20:49.582
afraid to be myself,

20:49.616 --> 20:52.285
playing into stereotypes
so he won't be judged.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.088
But he can only do that
if I'm not afraid.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.257
So, go ahead.

20:58.291 --> 21:02.094
Put our son in
the dress... gown.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.797
But I do have one
slight adjustment.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.604
(laughs)

21:11.638 --> 21:13.172
It's perfect.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.843
It's odd and amazing,
and it will confuse everyone.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.778
(laughs)
And I love it.
