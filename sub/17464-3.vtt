<i>Previously on Rectify...</i>

00:02.001 --> 00:04.829
I don't think you killed
George, I think it was Trey.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.603
My heart breaks for you, Teddy.

00:06.604 --> 00:08.801
But my heart breaks
for my other son too.

00:08.802 --> 00:11.969
Amantha? It's Billy. Billy Harris.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.246
Shit fire, Billy.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.677
When you're always youself all the time,

00:16.678 --> 00:18.973
it feels like that you no longer exist.

00:18.974 --> 00:21.428
We're here to help you. We really are.

00:21.429 --> 00:23.563
Do you want me here with you?

00:23.564 --> 00:25.680
I don't know if I want
to be married with you.

00:25.681 --> 00:28.564
I'm Daniel. I don't know
many people out here.

00:28.565 --> 00:30.102
Hello, Daniel.

00:37.272 --> 00:38.605
Hey, Manny.

00:42.705 --> 00:44.379
Hey, Manny, wake up.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.385
Hey, Manny.

00:50.107 --> 00:52.220
Manny-Manny.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.657
Manny-Manny.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.865
- Wake up.
- Hey, what the hell, punk?

01:10.866 --> 01:12.368
- It's Dan, Manny.
- What?

01:12.369 --> 01:15.337
It's Dan. You turned off your
alarm and went back to sleep.

01:15.338 --> 01:16.806
- I did?
- Twice.

01:16.807 --> 01:18.173
Oh, shit.

01:18.174 --> 01:21.310
I-I called your name a few times, but...

01:21.975 --> 01:23.879
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.947
I kind of go deep.

01:25.948 --> 01:27.983
You're a sound sleeper.

01:27.984 --> 01:30.220
Shit you sleep through in prison, right?

01:31.287 --> 01:33.389
I have a meeting I have to attend.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.690
I slept through a riot
once. Swear to God.

01:35.691 --> 01:37.292
It was on another tier, but still,

01:37.293 --> 01:40.929
no such thing as a quiet riot, right?

01:44.334 --> 01:47.036
Right, well, you got to go, Dan.

01:47.037 --> 01:48.806
Appreciate the tickle.

01:50.873 --> 01:53.175
Are... Are y... Are you straight

01:53.176 --> 01:55.329
with the... the Metro card now?

01:55.330 --> 01:56.436
Yeah, I got it.

01:58.957 --> 02:01.331
You have a nice day, Manny.

02:01.952 --> 02:03.761
Sure. Why not?

02:21.479 --> 02:22.148
Hey.

02:22.547 --> 02:23.416
Come on in.

02:24.949 --> 02:25.951
Have a seat.

02:26.985 --> 02:28.154
You cleaned up.

02:28.553 --> 02:29.653
A new leaf.

02:30.755 --> 02:32.660
How's Manny doing?

02:32.661 --> 02:36.060
He seems to be acclimating.

02:36.061 --> 02:38.161
Oh. Well, that's good.

02:38.162 --> 02:40.433
How are you guys doing, you and Manny?

02:41.900 --> 02:44.133
He's hard to ignore.

02:44.134 --> 02:46.851
But that's probably good for me.

02:48.090 --> 02:49.809
Work going okay?

02:50.819 --> 02:52.612
From my perspective.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.545
Why?

02:57.115 --> 03:01.018
Dan, I know you've been talking
to Avery some, which is good,

03:01.019 --> 03:04.188
and he hasn't gone into
any details with me.

03:04.189 --> 03:06.991
I just want to be clear about that.

03:08.092 --> 03:09.226
Okay.

03:09.227 --> 03:13.564
But we think that you should
consider seeing someone

03:13.565 --> 03:16.900
more qualified to treat some
of your specific issues...

03:16.901 --> 03:19.037
your PTSD.

03:19.971 --> 03:22.839
And considering the years
of isolation you endured,

03:22.840 --> 03:24.774
there are likely long-term effects

03:24.775 --> 03:27.880
which are frankly beyond our expertise.

03:29.548 --> 03:34.669
Well, that's interesting to
think about, Avery, Maggie.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.788
But I-I feel that I am integrating

03:38.789 --> 03:42.161
with the men at the house more now.

03:43.131 --> 03:45.762
Oh, we are not suggesting
you leave the house, Dan...

03:45.763 --> 03:46.731
on the contrary.

03:46.732 --> 03:48.631
We think this is exactly
where you should be.

03:48.632 --> 03:50.667
But we feel that additional therapy

03:50.668 --> 03:52.736
to augment what we can offer

03:52.737 --> 03:56.273
would greatly increase your
chances of, you know...

03:56.274 --> 03:59.178
Becoming an upstanding citizen?

04:00.245 --> 04:04.082
Of having a quality of life
that we all want for you.

04:09.888 --> 04:11.890
Do you have any questions for us?

04:14.358 --> 04:17.327
What are you talking about, exactly?

04:19.997 --> 04:23.299
There's a clinical
psychologist at Vanderbilt

04:23.300 --> 04:26.703
who treats individuals with PTSD.

04:26.704 --> 04:29.339
Now, a lot of his patients
are military veterans,

04:29.340 --> 04:32.210
but he also works with ex-offenders.

04:36.246 --> 04:38.982
Just think about it, hmm?

04:38.983 --> 04:41.285
No more than that right now, all right?

04:43.054 --> 04:45.024
But otherwise, keep up the good work.

04:46.332 --> 04:47.415
Sure.

05:18.196 --> 05:23.196

05:29.234 --> 05:30.829
What do you think about the muffin?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.537
It's chewy.

05:32.538 --> 05:34.039
Yeah, it's got bran and stuff.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.508
Sticks your ribs, all right.

05:36.509 --> 05:38.785
Exactly. See, that's the
problem with doughnuts.

05:38.786 --> 05:39.944
You eat one of them, five minutes later,

05:39.945 --> 05:41.713
you get a sugar drop,
you want another one.

05:42.388 --> 05:44.472
Probably wouldn't want
another one of these.

05:46.019 --> 05:47.552
Yeah.

05:47.553 --> 05:51.023
Anyway, uh, your car
will be ready in a few.

05:54.793 --> 05:57.397
Paulie Tire. Teddy.

05:58.407 --> 06:01.344
Uh, owner's not here right
now. Can I help you?

06:02.702 --> 06:05.872
Yes, uh, she is the
owner of record, but...

06:07.207 --> 06:08.773
Well, the problem is,

06:08.774 --> 06:10.775
Janet doesn't come in to
the store very often,

06:10.776 --> 06:12.210
but I'm her stepson

06:12.211 --> 06:14.414
and, uh, Vice President of
Sales here, so if th...

06:15.714 --> 06:17.049
Sure.

06:17.050 --> 06:19.218
I understand.

06:19.219 --> 06:21.919
302. Yep.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.223
Uh, anything else you'd
like for me to pass on?

06:25.224 --> 06:27.492
Okay, Bob.

06:27.493 --> 06:28.628
Well, this is Ted, by the way.

06:28.629 --> 06:32.065
Not sure where Carol
and Alice are, but...

06:33.065 --> 06:37.134
Ah, nothing, just a... a
weird film I saw once.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.737
You bet.

06:38.738 --> 06:40.939
I'll have her call you back.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.840
Who was that?

06:42.841 --> 06:47.211
Bob Childers from Kurry
Morris and Associates.

06:47.212 --> 06:49.847
Don't believe I know them.

06:49.848 --> 06:51.294
Me, either.

06:52.084 --> 06:53.886
What did he want?

06:53.887 --> 06:58.925
Talk to the owner, a Mrs.
Janet Matthews Holden.

06:59.993 --> 07:01.792
He say about what?

07:01.793 --> 07:03.061
Nope.

07:03.062 --> 07:05.638
Just said he wanted to talk to
her about a business matter.

07:06.832 --> 07:08.266
Huh.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.035
She ever change her name
on the title of ownership

07:11.036 --> 07:12.673
after y'all got married?

07:14.240 --> 07:15.905
Probably not.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.725
Hello, Mr. Stern.

07:34.726 --> 07:36.194
Sheriff.

07:36.195 --> 07:37.629
Thank you, Rhetta.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.597
Yes, sir.

07:42.235 --> 07:44.802
You want one of these pod coffees?

07:44.803 --> 07:46.804
Lots of different flavors.

07:46.805 --> 07:49.691
No. I'm good. Thanks.

07:51.117 --> 07:52.710
Care to sit down?

07:52.711 --> 07:54.647
Been sitting all day.

07:55.714 --> 07:57.949
So, what brings you back to Paulie?

07:57.950 --> 08:00.085
Did you tell my client that
it was George Melton's semen

08:00.086 --> 08:02.089
on Hanna Dean's panties?

08:03.156 --> 08:05.023
I might have, yes.

08:05.024 --> 08:07.092
And that you believe that
George, Trey Willis,

08:07.093 --> 08:09.660
and someone named Chris
Nelms raped Hanna?

08:11.130 --> 08:14.299
You tell suspects many things
during an investigation...

08:15.634 --> 08:18.203
Some true, some not.

08:18.204 --> 08:20.574
So, Daniel was still a
suspect at the time?

08:21.974 --> 08:23.576
To some degree.

08:24.209 --> 08:27.011
Do you have evidence to support
the allegations of rape

08:27.012 --> 08:28.347
by those men?

08:28.348 --> 08:30.616
Unfortunately, Mr. Stern,
we're in the midst

08:30.617 --> 08:34.018
of an ongoing investigation
of Mr. Melton's death.

08:34.019 --> 08:35.385
I'm sure you understand.

08:35.386 --> 08:37.256
No, I don't understand.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.991
There are confidential elements...

08:39.993 --> 08:41.727
All that I understand.

08:43.029 --> 08:46.230
The legal maneuverings,
the game of justice...

08:46.231 --> 08:47.999
too well, in fact.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.336
What I don't understand is you, sir.

08:52.839 --> 08:54.872
Even someone like Roland
Foulkes, I understand.

08:54.873 --> 08:56.273
I understand he doesn't
care about the truth.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.910
He just cares that he was right...

08:58.911 --> 09:01.813
that he is right, that
he will always be right.

09:01.814 --> 09:04.149
But you, Sheriff...

09:04.150 --> 09:06.418
I don't know what you care about...

09:06.419 --> 09:08.811
what matters to you.

09:09.821 --> 09:11.423
Being liked?

09:12.148 --> 09:13.324
Respected?

09:13.325 --> 09:15.660
- Re-elected?
- What's your point?

09:15.661 --> 09:16.895
That <i>is</i> my point.

09:16.896 --> 09:19.798
Mr. Stern, your client plead guilty

09:19.799 --> 09:22.900
to killing Hanna Dean with
you right by his side,

09:22.901 --> 09:24.669
I assume giving him counsel.

09:24.670 --> 09:25.637
Daniel plead guilty

09:25.638 --> 09:28.339
because I couldn't
convince him to fight...

09:28.340 --> 09:30.342
because he was too afraid
of going back to prison,

09:30.343 --> 09:33.844
because he didn't trust the
system, me included...

09:33.845 --> 09:35.881
because George Melton
hadn't turned up dead yet,

09:35.882 --> 09:38.150
because we didn't know about
the rapes and the sperm

09:38.151 --> 09:40.886
and that George went to C.J.
Pickens 20 years ago...

09:40.887 --> 09:41.886
20 years ago...

09:41.887 --> 09:43.988
and the former good
sheriff of this county...

09:43.989 --> 09:46.857
your county, sir...
wouldn't even talk to him!

09:51.679 --> 09:53.330
That's true, isn't it?

09:54.124 --> 09:56.934
You'll have to ask C.J. about that.

09:56.935 --> 09:59.739
Really? That's your answer?

10:03.810 --> 10:05.077
Did you speak to the former sheriff

10:05.078 --> 10:07.779
before or after the plea
deal with my client?

10:09.114 --> 10:10.750
I'm done talking.

10:13.719 --> 10:17.021
I think I understand you
better now, Sheriff.

10:17.022 --> 10:18.332
I doubt it.

10:19.025 --> 10:20.993
Well, I hope you're right...

10:22.060 --> 10:23.353
or I'm wrong.

10:42.982 --> 10:43.750
Hello?

10:45.017 --> 10:46.184
I got you.

10:46.185 --> 10:49.187
- I-I'm on break.
- Oh, good.

10:49.188 --> 10:51.222
I'm at the grocery store.

10:51.223 --> 10:53.046
That's nice.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.327
Mother?

10:55.995 --> 10:57.963
I have to see you, Daniel.

10:57.964 --> 10:59.330
Is everything okay?

10:59.331 --> 11:01.867
Um...

11:01.868 --> 11:03.300
yes and no.

11:03.301 --> 11:06.505
I mean, I just can't go this
long without seeing you.

11:06.506 --> 11:10.541
Well, I'm... I'm really
doing great now, Mother.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.844
You don't need to make a special trip.

11:13.845 --> 11:16.113
I'm coming to Nashville...

11:16.114 --> 11:16.982
just for a day.

11:16.983 --> 11:20.218
I'm not gonna... camp out or anything.

11:20.219 --> 11:23.683
I just want to touch you,
make sure you're real.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.525
Okay.

11:26.526 --> 11:30.328
But maybe we should have lunch, too.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.432
Deal.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.301
A-A-Are you sure it's okay?

11:37.302 --> 11:40.070
I didn't think I had a
choice in the matter.

11:40.071 --> 11:41.540
Well, you don't, really.

11:41.541 --> 11:44.242
Then... it's okay.

11:44.243 --> 11:46.377
Okay.

11:46.378 --> 11:47.945
Good.

11:48.915 --> 11:51.082
All right, I'll let you
know when I'm coming.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.818
Bye, now. I love you.

13:08.474 --> 13:11.168
How have you been feeling
around Teddy lately?

13:13.513 --> 13:14.979
What do you think?

13:14.980 --> 13:16.325
I mean, he's...

13:17.517 --> 13:22.586
He's been so lovin'
and so understandin'.

13:22.587 --> 13:25.156
It's not even a trick, either.

13:25.157 --> 13:27.460
He's come a long way, hasn't he?

13:29.162 --> 13:30.864
So have you, Tawney.

13:32.363 --> 13:33.830
If you say so.

13:33.831 --> 13:37.934
It's a process... a lifelong one.

13:38.397 --> 13:41.505
Mm, I still catch myself
trying to figure out

13:41.506 --> 13:43.073
who people want me to be...

13:43.907 --> 13:46.944
rather than... being who I am.

13:46.945 --> 13:49.988
But you're aware of it now, right?

13:52.184 --> 13:54.131
When we first got together...

13:55.219 --> 13:59.185
I used to like it when
Teddy just kind of...

13:59.990 --> 14:01.418
took me over.

14:03.118 --> 14:05.829
I felt... I don't know.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.497
Absorbed.

14:07.498 --> 14:08.866
Safe.

14:08.867 --> 14:13.038
I-I mean, it... it felt safe at first.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.842
And then I... then I
stopped liking it so much.

14:17.843 --> 14:19.742
Not liking it so much?

14:19.743 --> 14:21.223
Resenting it...

14:22.012 --> 14:23.715
being annoyed by it...

14:24.215 --> 14:25.915
and hating it.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.151
And why is that?

14:27.152 --> 14:29.886
Because I want to be my
own person, Rebecca.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.599
Careful what you wish for.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.736
Do you think I should just do it?

14:45.136 --> 14:47.510
- Do what?
- Leave.

14:48.659 --> 14:50.774
Just leave.

14:51.464 --> 14:54.786
- D-i-v-o-r-c-e?
- I don't know.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.280
What do <i>you</i> think?

14:57.281 --> 15:01.084
I think it's unfair to Teddy to
keep treading water like this.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.656
It's been his choice, too, Tawney.

15:05.257 --> 15:06.223
Okay.

15:06.224 --> 15:10.419
What I really think... is it's...

15:11.629 --> 15:17.568
it's very, very sad and scary.

15:17.569 --> 15:20.271
And I'm... I'm not sure I can...

15:20.272 --> 15:21.804
Can what?

15:21.805 --> 15:24.172
I mean, Teddy's been my... my family...

15:25.277 --> 15:26.967
my only family, really.

15:28.113 --> 15:31.115
For better or worse, he's been there.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.486
Mm. It would...

15:37.122 --> 15:41.224
It would feel like a...
like a death, in a way.

15:41.225 --> 15:43.727
It might feel like that,

15:43.728 --> 15:46.138
but it wouldn't be, Tawney.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.801
You would still exist.

15:50.535 --> 15:51.963
I promise.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.031
This is quite the surprise.

16:06.274 --> 16:07.820
Of course we would. When?

16:08.903 --> 16:10.044
This Wednesday?

16:10.045 --> 16:11.679
That sounds fine, Bob.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.348
1:00 p.m. works.

16:13.349 --> 16:15.754
See you then.

16:17.124 --> 16:18.858
He wants to buy the store.

16:18.859 --> 16:20.058
Huh.

16:21.141 --> 16:22.994
It's like what you said...
how many things could it be?

16:22.995 --> 16:24.430
And that's what it was.

16:24.431 --> 16:26.632
Did he say how much or why?

16:26.633 --> 16:29.667
He actually said he was
representing someone

16:29.668 --> 16:32.404
and he wanted to come down
and make a formal offer

16:32.405 --> 16:34.105
for the property on their behalf.

16:34.106 --> 16:36.408
So, it's not a definite offer?

16:36.409 --> 16:37.920
He implied it would be.

16:38.979 --> 16:41.013
Did he say the store or the property?

16:41.711 --> 16:44.939
I think he said the property, but
the store is on the property.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.185
What difference does it make?

16:46.186 --> 16:48.620
It could be somebody who
just wants the property.

16:48.621 --> 16:50.623
And do what? Tear down the building?

16:50.624 --> 16:51.892
I don't know.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.831
He didn't sound regional.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.167
Probably you should let Teddy know.

17:01.168 --> 17:03.201
I'm sure he's on pins and needles.

17:03.202 --> 17:06.439
Teddy should be there at the
meeting, don't you think?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.740
Couldn't hurt to have
another set of ears.

17:08.741 --> 17:11.710
Maybe <i>all</i> the kids should be there.

17:11.711 --> 17:13.012
I don't know.

17:13.012 --> 17:16.016
We don't even have an offer yet.

17:17.715 --> 17:19.685
Might not be worth riling everybody up.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.085
Y-You know what?

17:21.086 --> 17:23.021
I-I need time to think about this.

17:23.022 --> 17:24.522
Don't tell Teddy yet.

17:24.523 --> 17:26.558
Don't tell him that you
talked to the guy?

17:26.559 --> 17:27.858
You can tell him <i>that.</i>

17:27.859 --> 17:30.462
I mean, just not about
the specific details

17:30.463 --> 17:31.797
of the what and why.

17:32.698 --> 17:33.865
Okay.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.701
I'm not saying I don't want Teddy there.

17:36.702 --> 17:37.627
I just...

17:38.505 --> 17:40.873
This is just so out of the blue, Ted.

17:40.874 --> 17:45.143
- I need time to process.
- Sure, Janet.

17:45.877 --> 17:47.579
And I don't want you to worry.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.714
I'm not gonna sell the store

17:49.715 --> 17:52.335
unless everybody agrees
that's the thing to do.

17:52.919 --> 17:54.553
I'm not worried.

17:54.554 --> 17:57.522
I just think you should hear the offer,

17:57.523 --> 18:00.885
if there is an offer, and
we'll go from there.

18:02.755 --> 18:04.307
Sounds like a plan.

18:08.201 --> 18:12.738
Well, I-I go there
sometimes a-after work

18:12.739 --> 18:14.906
a-and just hang out.

18:14.907 --> 18:19.545
But tonight, they're... they're
having a special event,

18:19.546 --> 18:21.180
so I-I-I'm gonna go.

18:21.181 --> 18:22.847
Go.

18:22.848 --> 18:24.916
You made you any art yet, Dan?

18:24.917 --> 18:27.752
I don't know if I'll
actually make anything.

18:27.753 --> 18:30.823
I just like to watch, like
Chauncey the gardener.

18:32.558 --> 18:34.527
Sounds like it's good for
you, this co-op art place.

18:34.528 --> 18:38.130
Never could quite see you hanging
out with the racecar crowd.

18:39.874 --> 18:42.087
Looks like you found some people
that you can get down with.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.659
- I-I hope so.
- "Being There."

18:46.660 --> 18:49.429
The, um, "Pink Panther" dude.

18:49.430 --> 18:51.997
Yeah. "Being There."

18:53.800 --> 18:56.870
What?

18:56.871 --> 19:00.342
Are there gonna be any girls
at this arty-farty thing?

19:02.213 --> 19:04.843
They're generally part of the equation.

19:08.626 --> 19:11.785
Maybe old Manny should
tag along, you know?

19:11.786 --> 19:14.522
Moral support.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.624
Uh, I-I don't know, Manny.

19:19.171 --> 19:22.027
Probably ought to let Dan
have this one for himself.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.830
What are you, his daddy now?

19:24.802 --> 19:25.899
What?

19:25.900 --> 19:28.769
Whoa, whoa. What's going on here, Manny?

19:30.109 --> 19:31.504
Nothing, boss man.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.474
Now, first, I ain't your boss man,

19:34.475 --> 19:37.177
and second... what's going on?

19:38.808 --> 19:39.544
You know.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.548
Did over a nickel in prison,

19:42.549 --> 19:44.583
so want to have a little
fun every once in a while.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.474
That's all.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.455
When was the last time you had
fun that didn't equal trouble?

19:48.456 --> 19:51.157
- On the outside?
- Ain't been on the outside.

19:51.158 --> 19:53.860
You ain't been out two good weeks yet,
Manny. You think it's good judgment

19:53.861 --> 19:56.855
to show up at somebody
else's party uninvited?

19:58.632 --> 20:00.101
Didn't know it was invite-only.

20:01.535 --> 20:02.133
Mm.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.237
Two things, fellas... check your motives

20:04.238 --> 20:06.672
and please share any ideas or impulses

20:06.673 --> 20:08.807
with me or somebody else in the group.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.989
Don't keep your own counsel.

20:11.889 --> 20:13.580
And I don't need to tell you why.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.736
Hey, Dad.

20:36.737 --> 20:40.640
Well, she called the guy... Bob.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.042
He say what it was about?

20:43.043 --> 20:44.843
He didn't go into details,

20:44.844 --> 20:48.081
but, uh, it seems he wants to
talk further about things.

20:48.082 --> 20:49.649
That's mysterious.

20:51.151 --> 20:53.719
Anyway, just wanted to let you know.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.955
Well, Kurry Morris and Associates

20:55.956 --> 20:58.624
is a firm that searches for properties

20:58.625 --> 21:01.205
for large retail
corporations to purchase.

21:02.648 --> 21:03.962
Is that right?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.099
I mean, if old Bob's
as vague as you say,

21:06.100 --> 21:08.180
this might be useful
information for you and Janet.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.304
Well, he did mention perhaps
they were interested

21:12.305 --> 21:14.106
in making an offer

21:14.107 --> 21:18.448
or at least were considering our
property for, um, purchase.

21:18.449 --> 21:20.979
- Who's "they"?
- I didn't talk to him, Teddy.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.881
- He just...
- Just what?

21:24.285 --> 21:26.538
Well, I think he might want a meetin'.

21:28.906 --> 21:31.742
- Here?
- Believe so.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.522
He say when?

21:33.523 --> 21:36.466
Uh... well, he was
talking about Wednesday.

21:38.004 --> 21:39.905
W-Were y'all even gonna
tell me about the meeting?

21:39.906 --> 21:41.207
Of course.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.943
Look, son, this has got
Janet all twisted.

21:42.944 --> 21:46.980
She just wanted some time
to... to figure on things

21:47.442 --> 21:49.481
without telling all the kids yet.

21:50.016 --> 21:51.352
"All the kids"?

21:52.419 --> 21:54.053
I know what this sounds like,

21:54.054 --> 21:56.021
but I'm in a tough position here, Teddy.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.163
It's...

21:59.164 --> 22:01.027
kind of your bed, ain't it, Dad?

22:01.028 --> 22:03.177
I got to go. Somebody's knocking.

22:11.304 --> 22:12.606
Hi.

22:12.607 --> 22:17.610
I'm, uh, Melvin, the apartment manager.

22:17.611 --> 22:20.447
Oh, right. Come on in, buddy.

22:30.755 --> 22:31.817
You got a visitor.

22:32.791 --> 22:35.340
Thank you, Peanut.

22:44.223 --> 22:45.560
Hey.

22:47.570 --> 22:49.677
Been meaning to come by here.

22:49.678 --> 22:50.707
Oh, yeah?

22:50.708 --> 22:53.276
Needed some paper products, too, so...

22:53.277 --> 22:56.714
Oh. Well, we have a wide assortment.

22:59.518 --> 23:01.481
That's not really true. We
have a <i>cheap</i> assortment.

23:01.482 --> 23:03.147
You want to go get a beer sometime?

23:03.148 --> 23:04.354
A beer?

23:06.361 --> 23:08.024
- Well...
- I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

23:08.025 --> 23:11.328
Just, after seeing you the
other night, I thought...

23:12.213 --> 23:13.805
might be fun or something.

23:15.411 --> 23:17.801
- Where?
- County Line?

23:17.802 --> 23:19.637
Country Club?

23:20.250 --> 23:21.561
My tailgate?

23:21.562 --> 23:24.234
- The usual suspects?
- Same old Paulie.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.367
Well, uh, um...

23:30.194 --> 23:31.992
Probably a bad idea.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.820
I always try and keep
a few of those handy.

23:36.924 --> 23:37.754
Why not?

23:39.110 --> 23:43.427
I could, uh, use a beer, frankly,
before going back to Mother's.

23:43.428 --> 23:46.030
- Tonight?
- Sure.

23:47.123 --> 23:49.076
Okay, sure. Why not?

23:50.235 --> 23:52.703
- Um...
- Um...

23:53.360 --> 23:56.466
Well, we're getting ready to close up.

23:56.467 --> 23:59.206
- You mind hanging out for a few?
- Be here hanging.

24:00.577 --> 24:01.577
Okay.

24:13.757 --> 24:16.092
<i>At the tone, please record your message.</i>

24:17.428 --> 24:20.592
Hey, Janet, uh, it's John Stern.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.867
Um... I'm... I just wanted
you and the family to know

24:23.868 --> 24:25.436
that I'm back in town.

24:25.437 --> 24:27.103
Uh, nothing to worry about, really,

24:27.104 --> 24:30.940
just tying up a few loose ends.

24:30.941 --> 24:34.682
Um, anyway, um, I'll try
and stop by the house...

24:35.593 --> 24:37.214
before I head back north.

24:38.541 --> 24:40.284
It would be lovely to see you all.

24:41.453 --> 24:43.786
Okay, then. Bye-bye.

24:49.898 --> 24:52.295
Okay, what else?

24:52.296 --> 24:53.731
Um...

24:55.560 --> 24:59.691
laundry-room key, uh, pool hours.

24:59.692 --> 25:03.139
That's about it, really, um...

25:03.140 --> 25:05.842
Oh, don't... don't grill after 10:00.

25:05.843 --> 25:07.312
Got it.

25:10.982 --> 25:13.851
Well...

25:15.710 --> 25:17.777
You wouldn't happen
to have another beer?

25:18.685 --> 25:19.725
Sure.

25:20.958 --> 25:24.360
- I'm off hours.
- Great.

25:29.801 --> 25:32.364
- How's he doing?
- Who?

25:33.502 --> 25:34.804
Daniel.

25:35.154 --> 25:38.710
Oh, right, right. Uh, well...

25:40.011 --> 25:41.601
he's adjusting.

25:44.809 --> 25:47.181
And he's got a full-time job.

25:47.182 --> 25:48.812
Now, that's wonderful.

25:49.496 --> 25:51.789
Uh, doing what?

25:52.735 --> 25:54.102
Uh, well...

25:54.990 --> 25:57.794
Janet's been talkin' to
him mostly, Melvin, so...

25:58.977 --> 26:01.130
I gave him his first job.

26:01.131 --> 26:02.403
Oh, really?

26:04.101 --> 26:07.498
Right after he got out
of that... hellhole.

26:08.238 --> 26:09.939
Painting our pool.

26:11.141 --> 26:12.909
Well, good for you.

26:12.910 --> 26:15.024
It <i>was</i> good for me.

26:15.836 --> 26:18.203
<i>He</i> was good for me.

26:19.813 --> 26:21.083
I miss him.

26:24.366 --> 26:26.121
And now, with all this...

26:27.040 --> 26:28.847
shit that's come out...

26:29.315 --> 26:30.859
It's a lot.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.535
It just breaks your heart, doesn't it?

26:35.547 --> 26:37.400
I don't know why it's
hitting me so hard tonight.

26:37.401 --> 26:40.937
I... I mean, it's nothing

26:40.938 --> 26:43.573
compared to what y'all
must be going through.

26:43.574 --> 26:46.342
I don't... I don't mean
to imply that, Ted.

26:47.294 --> 26:48.412
Oh, no.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.835
Everybody has their own
experience, Melvin.

27:02.056 --> 27:04.591
- Cecilia Abbott.
- Wait.

27:04.592 --> 27:07.762
Lives in Birmingham, five kids,

27:07.763 --> 27:09.629
sells... something.

27:09.630 --> 27:10.831
Close.

27:10.832 --> 27:13.004
Lives in Macon, has three kids,

27:13.005 --> 27:15.344
second husband, sells Mary Kay.

27:15.345 --> 27:16.118
Yes!

27:19.461 --> 27:22.810
- Who do you think is the richest?
- In our class?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.515
- You miss curfew?
- You're funny.

27:32.787 --> 27:36.122
You need to take that?
I'll step outside.

27:36.123 --> 27:39.693
No. I don't need to take this.

27:39.694 --> 27:41.444
Where were we?

27:43.230 --> 27:46.177
- Dustin Hunt.
- The richest?

27:46.668 --> 27:49.136
- Bullshit.
- Got into finance after college.

27:49.934 --> 27:53.206
Well... good for old Dustin.

27:53.207 --> 27:55.476
Yep. Good for him.

27:58.746 --> 27:59.947
Is it like a lot, lot?

28:01.375 --> 28:04.346
Jenny Paar said he leases a jet.

28:04.837 --> 28:06.760
That's just wrong.

28:06.761 --> 28:08.757
Like a baby Lear or something.

28:10.177 --> 28:12.913
Jenny was my best friend
in seventh grade.

28:13.575 --> 28:15.678
Yeah, I remember y'all were tight.

28:15.679 --> 28:18.698
She talk shit about me like we're
talking shit about Dustin?

28:18.699 --> 28:20.503
Not that I know of.

28:21.611 --> 28:25.413
I won't say your name never
comes up in conversation,

28:25.414 --> 28:27.794
but everybody's name comes
up at some point or another.

28:27.795 --> 28:29.295
Like my brother's.

28:29.617 --> 28:31.157
Sometimes...

28:32.430 --> 28:33.880
especially lately.

28:35.391 --> 28:37.584
But I try and stay out of all that.

28:38.531 --> 28:40.087
Stay out of all that what?

28:40.642 --> 28:42.665
Speculation, I guess.

28:49.479 --> 28:51.931
You have another one of
them cheap-ass beers?

28:51.932 --> 28:53.533
When you put it like that...

29:06.081 --> 29:09.149
<i>Hi. This is Tawney.
Please leave a message.</i>

29:09.539 --> 29:11.140
Hey.

29:11.997 --> 29:13.298
I know you're working.

29:13.299 --> 29:14.310
You don't have to call me back.

29:14.311 --> 29:17.079
I'm about to turn in myself.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.317
Just, uh...

29:19.802 --> 29:21.720
had a really interesting day.

29:22.833 --> 29:24.442
And, uh...

29:26.324 --> 29:30.028
Well, I can tell you about
it on, uh, on date night.

29:32.835 --> 29:35.568
Until then, old Teddy signing out.

29:36.533 --> 29:37.925
Uh, I love you.

29:40.338 --> 29:43.006
I'm just saying that so
you know you're loved

29:43.007 --> 29:46.044
and, you know, in case you
think you're not sometimes.

29:48.111 --> 29:49.964
I hope this didn't freak you out.

29:50.613 --> 29:52.082
Old Teddy.

30:07.965 --> 30:11.702
- You look uncomfortable.
- Um, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to.

30:11.703 --> 30:14.637
No. That's a compliment.

30:15.521 --> 30:16.706
Oh.

30:16.707 --> 30:19.276
Nobody likes this, either team.

30:19.277 --> 30:21.346
It's just what our side has
to do to keep the lights on.

30:32.089 --> 30:33.589
Sorry if my, uh...

30:33.590 --> 30:36.559
my cynicism is raining
on your experience.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.997
Really. I think it's hormone-related.

30:46.104 --> 30:50.106
I'm not, uh, unfamiliar
with the cynic stance.

30:50.107 --> 30:51.348
I bet.

30:56.213 --> 30:58.581
Anyway, I think cynicism
gets a bad rap...

30:58.582 --> 31:01.485
from people who are afraid of it.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.687
Like optimists?

31:04.688 --> 31:06.789
Especially that tribe of un-heathens.

31:13.463 --> 31:18.636
So, what are you afraid of,
Chloe, if not optimism?

31:19.960 --> 31:21.397
Boredom.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.674
Why do you think that is?

31:25.675 --> 31:28.511
Because it's a sign that I have to...

31:28.512 --> 31:32.481
do something or change something.

31:32.482 --> 31:34.118
What happens if you don't?

31:37.750 --> 31:41.191
I become mean until others
change something...

31:41.192 --> 31:44.910
- usually their zip code.
- Is that a warning?

31:47.197 --> 31:49.066
I don't know you well enough yet.

31:50.534 --> 31:55.404
I try to stay in a...
constant state of boredom.

31:55.405 --> 31:57.242
Well, <i>that</i> can't be good.

31:58.076 --> 32:00.958
Probably not a long-term solution.

32:01.645 --> 32:05.517
But for now, it's a balm of a sort.

32:06.584 --> 32:09.318
You couldn't have been bored
when you first got out.

32:09.319 --> 32:11.654
No.

32:12.449 --> 32:13.589
Not bored.

32:15.187 --> 32:17.291
Wasn't even sure I was alive.

32:19.578 --> 32:23.098
Well, I'm not certain we are now.

32:32.643 --> 32:34.436
I Googled you.

32:39.853 --> 32:41.785
It's just what people do now,

32:42.285 --> 32:45.869
especially when they meet
somebody who's, you know...

32:46.223 --> 32:49.160
No, I-I-I don't know. Who's what?

32:50.616 --> 32:51.909
Google-able.

32:55.446 --> 32:56.988
And am I that?

32:57.702 --> 33:01.540
Yeah. You are that.

33:09.213 --> 33:11.329
So, what do you find when you...

33:11.848 --> 33:13.479
Google Daniel Holden?

33:14.551 --> 33:16.417
Anything you want to find.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.224
It's the Internet.

33:26.297 --> 33:28.253
Do you want to see my apartment?

33:28.732 --> 33:30.347
I have to get off my feet.

33:32.369 --> 33:34.820
- Or not.
- Sure.

34:00.964 --> 34:02.898
I hope you weren't waiting up for <i>me.</i>

34:02.899 --> 34:07.505
Your father never really
liked the tire business.

34:08.572 --> 34:10.306
Okay.

34:10.308 --> 34:13.510
I mean, it wasn't in his
blood or anything like that.

34:13.511 --> 34:17.513
But why would anyone have
tires in their blood...

34:17.514 --> 34:19.935
stinky tires, for God's sake?

34:20.917 --> 34:25.023
It was just a business he could
support his family with.

34:25.858 --> 34:28.491
Your dad was in the family business.

34:29.078 --> 34:30.926
What brought all of this on?

34:30.927 --> 34:32.996
I didn't want you to come back here

34:32.996 --> 34:35.141
to be my de facto psychiatrist.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.025
I really didn't, Amantha.

34:37.027 --> 34:39.830
I don't want to do that
to you, not anymore.

34:39.831 --> 34:42.976
I came here wide-eyed and of
my own free will, Mother...

34:43.908 --> 34:45.407
mostly.

34:46.426 --> 34:48.280
How was your date with Billy?

34:51.683 --> 34:53.817
Showing up at my work is...

34:54.550 --> 34:56.952
hard to qualify as a date,

34:58.019 --> 35:01.023
but, uh, it was... nice.

35:01.024 --> 35:03.326
He still do yards?

35:03.327 --> 35:05.962
He's still in that line of work, Mother,

35:05.963 --> 35:09.532
but I believe he prefers
the title of "landscaper."

35:09.533 --> 35:10.733
Mm.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.993
You think you'll see him again?

35:13.994 --> 35:17.840
Uh, yes, in fact, I do.

35:17.841 --> 35:19.541
We're going huntin' this weekend.

35:20.985 --> 35:25.031
- Hunting? Hunting what?
- Foul.

35:27.046 --> 35:30.019
- Have you been drinking?
- Not as much as you.

35:35.859 --> 35:38.530
Your friend Jon called.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.669
Yeah, he called me, too.

35:41.670 --> 35:44.805
But, uh, I haven't listened
to the message yet.

35:50.727 --> 35:53.908
What does my friend have on his mind?

35:55.406 --> 35:56.813
He's in town.

35:56.814 --> 35:59.048
- What?
- Poking around.

35:59.049 --> 36:00.449
Why?

36:00.450 --> 36:01.818
Guilt, probably.

36:01.819 --> 36:03.686
Well, if that's the reason,
then he should see

36:03.687 --> 36:04.954
the psychiatrist that you're not seeing.

36:04.955 --> 36:08.757
- I'm going to bed.
- Somebody wants to buy the store.

36:10.589 --> 36:13.096
- What?
- Isn't that just strange?

36:14.010 --> 36:16.032
What are you talking about?

36:17.635 --> 36:19.433
I'm not supposed to tell you yet.

36:20.437 --> 36:21.804
Why not?

36:21.805 --> 36:24.993
Because I asked Ted not
to tell Teddy yet.

36:26.138 --> 36:27.576
And why not?

36:28.545 --> 36:32.014
So that I could sit here and sip my wine

36:32.015 --> 36:34.524
and ruminate on the tire business

36:34.525 --> 36:35.678
and all the business

36:35.679 --> 36:39.196
that goes with the business
of the tire business.

36:40.641 --> 36:43.992
Okay, well, I won't say anything

36:43.993 --> 36:46.894
until whoever knows or
needs to know knows.

36:53.476 --> 36:56.128
It was never really fair to Ted.

36:57.170 --> 36:58.611
What wasn't?

36:59.840 --> 37:03.012
All of this, all this shit...

37:04.942 --> 37:07.415
all this shit he just walked into.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.569
I grabbed him like he was a
life preserver, you know?

37:14.921 --> 37:17.231
Think I might have pulled him under.

37:27.470 --> 37:31.192
- Do you have any more wine?
- Yes, please.

37:40.583 --> 37:43.513
- Did you paint this?
- I wish.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.735
I make trinkets.

37:47.166 --> 37:51.008
- But I do think that I have an eye.
- An eye for what?

37:52.327 --> 37:54.116
That which is provocative.

38:05.307 --> 38:07.311
What's your deal?

38:08.778 --> 38:12.128
- What do you mean?
- Regarding me.

38:12.548 --> 38:14.546
I didn't know that I had to have a deal.

38:15.651 --> 38:19.788
- Do <i>you</i> have a deal regarding <i>me?</i>
- Probably.

38:21.458 --> 38:25.773
I don't collect wounded animals,
if that's what you mean.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.734
- You like being around danger?
- Are you dangerous?

38:33.599 --> 38:35.213
Sometimes.

38:35.214 --> 38:39.203
Mostly to myself, rarely others.

38:39.842 --> 38:42.111
That's useful information.

38:45.447 --> 38:48.783
Look, I don't have myself
completely figured out yet,

38:48.784 --> 38:51.886
so I... I can't ascribe a clear motive

38:51.887 --> 38:54.256
to my every action and desire.

38:54.257 --> 38:57.893
But I can say that I'm not looking
for a longtime companion...

38:58.562 --> 39:00.857
or a sex partner, for that matter.

39:01.614 --> 39:07.685
- So, you're looking for a platonic fling.
- With a straight man, preferably.

39:12.608 --> 39:14.819
That's an odd proposition.

39:16.345 --> 39:18.548
Okay, I do kind of have a deal.

39:19.615 --> 39:21.651
And what's that?

39:22.719 --> 39:24.063
I'm pregnant.

39:27.969 --> 39:31.259
- Don't worry.
- You're not the father.

39:35.092 --> 39:37.095
Do you know who is?

39:38.887 --> 39:40.121
Rude.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.803
Of course I know who the father is.

39:42.804 --> 39:46.050
- And where might he be?
- I ran him off.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.901
Trust me. He was not up for the task.

39:54.583 --> 40:00.221
- So, this is like a... job interview.
- Don't flatter yourself.

40:00.222 --> 40:04.270
I already told you... I'm
not looking for no man.

40:04.953 --> 40:07.641
<i>If</i> I decide to have this thing,

40:07.642 --> 40:11.323
I'm gonna go to my sister's,
birth it with her.

40:14.173 --> 40:15.771
And what then?

40:16.838 --> 40:21.340
I will raise it like my
own or give it away,

40:21.754 --> 40:23.570
sell it on the black market.

40:24.430 --> 40:28.719
I thought you hadn't decided whether
you were gonna have it or not.

40:29.786 --> 40:31.671
I can't not have it.

40:33.789 --> 40:35.575
Why not?

40:38.154 --> 40:40.995
You know what? You should run away, too.

40:40.996 --> 40:43.732
You can come back to the
co-op anytime you want,

40:43.733 --> 40:45.801
and I will not glom on to you again.

40:45.802 --> 40:46.883
Prometto.

40:53.373 --> 40:58.564
Is that what you're doing... glomming?

41:00.221 --> 41:02.272
I have no idea what I'm doing.

41:02.898 --> 41:07.171
I gave up pot and I gave up
booze and I gave up dairy.

41:07.772 --> 41:11.292
I've given up pretty much
everything except for hormones,

41:11.293 --> 41:15.685
so I have no idea at this time as
to what it is that I am doing.

41:19.786 --> 41:21.331
Hey.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.828
We could start a club.

41:28.483 --> 41:30.661
I think mine's temporary.

41:31.150 --> 41:32.431
Is yours?

41:33.390 --> 41:34.707
I doubt it.

41:41.441 --> 41:43.693
Are you really pregnant?

41:46.088 --> 41:47.881
Geez Louise.

41:51.601 --> 41:53.763
Okay, this is gonna be a little fresh,

41:54.903 --> 41:58.406
but I think it's gonna help
you in the big picture.

41:58.407 --> 41:59.956
Come here.

42:05.716 --> 42:07.700
Closer, danger man.

42:13.623 --> 42:17.432
Just remember that we're
all professionals here.

42:49.592 --> 42:51.223
You feel that?

42:55.063 --> 42:56.765
Yes.

42:59.697 --> 43:01.696
That's my little baby.

43:08.510 --> 43:10.280
You still bored?

43:13.816 --> 43:15.175
No.

43:16.952 --> 43:18.539
That's so nice...

43:20.307 --> 43:21.572
calming.

43:24.273 --> 43:25.540
Thank you.
