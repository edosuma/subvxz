WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:03.055
Well, I'm home.

00:04.991 --> 00:08.023
I always wondered if I'd
actually make it back here.

00:08.058 --> 00:10.026
Every detail.
Every decision.

00:10.062 --> 00:14.201
Every... everything,
all leading to this.

00:31.751 --> 00:33.015
Are you seriously
trying to slink

00:33.051 --> 00:34.687
out of your own
apartment?

00:38.224 --> 00:40.856
I was slinking out
to get us some breakfast.

00:45.665 --> 00:47.596
What's up?

00:47.632 --> 00:48.932
Patterson cracked
the next piece

00:48.968 --> 00:51.868
of Roman's video puzzle,
and...

00:51.904 --> 00:54.574
You can't talk to me
about it anymore.

00:57.075 --> 00:59.042
I really wish you could
see this through

00:59.078 --> 01:00.810
to the end with us.

01:00.846 --> 01:02.549
Maybe this is for the best.

01:03.849 --> 01:05.648
You have to go,
and I'll see you

01:05.684 --> 01:08.051
when I sign
my exit paperwork.

01:08.087 --> 01:09.121
Okay.

01:13.326 --> 01:14.861
See you soon.

01:22.234 --> 01:26.570
Moreover, what from being
so long in twilight or darkness,

01:26.606 --> 01:28.904
<i>his eyes had acquired
the faculty</i>

01:28.940 --> 01:32.042
<i>of distinguishing
three objects in the night,</i>

01:32.078 --> 01:35.245
<i>words common to the hyena
and the wolf.</i>

01:35.281 --> 01:36.813
So, obviously,

01:36.849 --> 01:38.814
Roman is quoting
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

01:38.850 --> 01:40.784
He did it in Venice,
he's doing it here.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.251
It's a whole
full-circle thing.

01:42.287 --> 01:44.087
It's very poetic,
if you think about it.

01:44.123 --> 01:46.855
Jane has a tattoo
of a hyena on her left elbow

01:46.891 --> 01:48.725
and a wolf on her right.

01:48.761 --> 01:50.826
There's a connection,
but we just

01:50.862 --> 01:52.295
can't figure out
what it is yet.

01:52.331 --> 01:54.129
Also, there are three
words that Roman says

01:54.165 --> 01:56.266
that do not appear in
the book's original text.

01:56.302 --> 01:57.834
What three words?

01:57.870 --> 01:59.302
Exactly.
He added them afterwards.

01:59.338 --> 02:01.103
So, what are they?

02:01.139 --> 02:02.237
What three words.

02:02.273 --> 02:03.707
The words Roman added.

02:03.743 --> 02:04.874
That's what I'm saying.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.843
- Saying what?
- That's one of them, yes.

02:06.879 --> 02:08.845
- Which three words?
- No, what three words.

02:08.881 --> 02:10.714
- Oh, my God.
- Rich.

02:10.750 --> 02:14.184
Stop. Roman added three
extra words to the quote,

02:14.220 --> 02:15.885
the word "what,"
the word "three,"

02:15.921 --> 02:17.119
and the word "words."

02:17.155 --> 02:18.254
Why didn't someone
just say that?

02:18.290 --> 02:19.856
- I did.
- I also did.

02:19.892 --> 02:20.923
He was trying.

02:20.959 --> 02:22.726
Hey, just be clear.

02:22.762 --> 02:25.728
It is a website that devised
an address system.

02:25.764 --> 02:28.665
It maps out the entire world
using a grid

02:28.701 --> 02:31.868
of three-meter by three-meter
squares using words.

02:31.904 --> 02:33.737
Enter any three words
into the search field

02:33.773 --> 02:36.739
and it points to a unique
and precise 3x3 location

02:36.775 --> 02:38.041
out in the real world.

02:38.077 --> 02:39.942
What three words
does Roman want us to use?

02:39.978 --> 02:41.276
What three words?

02:41.312 --> 02:43.178
That's what I just said.

02:43.214 --> 02:44.748
No, they're the ones
that Roman added.

02:47.386 --> 02:49.418
No, they are not!

02:49.454 --> 02:51.286
Those words
got us to the website,

02:51.322 --> 02:53.289
but they don't have a 3x3 grid
attached to it.

02:53.325 --> 02:55.225
We're just
trying to figure out

02:55.261 --> 02:56.959
where Roman is pointing us to.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.361
Well, keep figuring.

02:58.397 --> 02:59.696
In the meanwhile, we'll keep
looking for Crawford.

02:59.732 --> 03:00.897
If we can't find him soon,

03:00.933 --> 03:01.964
then we're gonna
lose him for good.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.936
So, where the hell is he?

03:05.004 --> 03:06.302
<i>Hello, Hank.</i>

03:06.338 --> 03:07.436
I've been calling
for hours, Tom.

03:07.472 --> 03:08.704
Where the hell are you?

03:08.740 --> 03:10.305
<i>Out of your reach.</i>

03:10.341 --> 03:12.441
I knew you'd blame me
for the failed attack.

03:12.477 --> 03:14.344
Well, I blame you for
a lot more than that.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.311
I never had a problem with
the FBI until you showed up.

03:16.347 --> 03:18.047
You brought this
on yourself.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.782
<i>No, you betrayed me,</i>

03:19.818 --> 03:21.451
and then you scurried away
like the little rat you are.

03:21.487 --> 03:24.254
<i>I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

03:24.290 --> 03:26.256
<i>I swear to God,
I am gonna find you,</i>

03:26.292 --> 03:27.389
<i>and when I do...</i>

03:27.425 --> 03:28.762
Hmm.

03:29.828 --> 03:30.959
Did you trace him?

03:30.995 --> 03:33.328
Forget Tom.
The FBI is closing...

03:33.364 --> 03:34.329
Yes or no?

03:34.365 --> 03:36.099
Yes. It wasn't easy,
but I...

03:36.135 --> 03:37.466
Where is he?

03:37.502 --> 03:40.470
Hank, you still
have options.

03:40.506 --> 03:42.272
- You can run.
- I don't run.

03:42.308 --> 03:43.972
Well,
then turn yourself in.

03:44.008 --> 03:45.809
Work the media angle,
paint yourself...

03:45.845 --> 03:47.109
No, no, no.
I'm gonna find Tom.

03:47.145 --> 03:48.477
I'm gonna silence him.

03:48.513 --> 03:50.714
I can hang the whole
UN attack at his door.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.214
I can survive this.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.216
- Hank, as your friend...
- I don't need your friendship.

03:54.252 --> 03:56.189
Just give me
the information.

03:59.524 --> 04:01.391
What the hell is going on?

04:01.427 --> 04:03.258
The news is saying
the FBI thinks

04:03.294 --> 04:05.127
you were involved in the
attack on the UN yesterday,

04:05.163 --> 04:06.495
and Tom's not answering
my calls.

04:06.531 --> 04:08.832
We can't worry
about Tom right now.

04:08.868 --> 04:11.267
And the FBI,
they're wrong.

04:11.303 --> 04:13.036
But if I don't leave now,

04:13.072 --> 04:14.870
I won't have
the chance to prove it.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.272
I have a flight to catch.

04:16.308 --> 04:19.108
What? Leave?
You're a wanted fugitive.

04:19.144 --> 04:20.375
How are you gonna
fly anywhere?

04:20.411 --> 04:23.880
We still have friends
in high places,

04:23.916 --> 04:25.447
people we can trust.

04:25.483 --> 04:27.517
Daddy, just stay.

04:27.553 --> 04:29.318
Trust me, we can... we can
figure this out together.

04:29.354 --> 04:30.786
I'll... I'll help you,
if you just...

04:30.822 --> 04:33.789
No, be smart.
Stay safe, hmm?

04:33.825 --> 04:35.858
You need to take every
precaution right now.

04:35.894 --> 04:37.060
This will all be
over soon.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.534
Crawford's on the move!

04:44.570 --> 04:46.269
A car service,
owned by a shell company

04:46.305 --> 04:48.070
of one of his many
shell companies

04:48.106 --> 04:50.406
just made a passenger pickup at
a building owned by HCI Global.

04:50.442 --> 04:52.175
An armored town car
heading to the airport.

04:52.211 --> 04:54.209
That's gotta be him.
We can intercept.

04:54.245 --> 04:55.447
We gotta mobilize the team.

05:04.055 --> 05:05.058
In position.

05:07.192 --> 05:08.925
<i>Everything's on track.</i>

05:08.961 --> 05:11.293
<i>Our helicopter team has eyes
on Crawford's car.</i>

05:11.329 --> 05:13.029
Ready.

05:13.065 --> 05:15.164
He should be pulling into
the choke point any second.

05:19.505 --> 05:20.540
Now! Now! Go!

05:31.517 --> 05:33.853
Get out of the car!
FBI!

05:36.120 --> 05:37.486
Get out of the car
and get...

05:37.522 --> 05:39.221
What the hell
are you doing?!

05:39.257 --> 05:40.556
It's a bait-and-switch.

05:40.592 --> 05:42.158
Where's Jane?

05:44.029 --> 05:45.094
<i>Jane!</i>

05:46.599 --> 05:48.034
<i>Jane!</i>

05:54.907 --> 05:56.707
Jane!

05:56.743 --> 05:59.976
Jane! Hey!

06:00.012 --> 06:01.979
What happened?
Are you okay?

06:02.015 --> 06:04.981
Yeah, I'm okay. My comms
went out. I missed the go.

06:05.017 --> 06:06.116
I thought Crawford...

06:06.152 --> 06:07.522
No, no, no, I'm okay.

06:11.858 --> 06:13.558
Her lawyer's on the way.

06:13.594 --> 06:15.159
So where are we on Roman's
three-word puzzle?

06:15.195 --> 06:16.893
- What three words?
- Not now, Rich.

06:16.929 --> 06:18.094
Copy that.

06:18.130 --> 06:19.563
Okay, we've for sure
got something.

06:19.599 --> 06:21.131
There are
a series of hidden numbers

06:21.167 --> 06:23.234
inside Jane's hyena
and wolf tattoos.

06:23.270 --> 06:25.635
They appear to point
to three words

06:25.671 --> 06:28.005
in the 1884 French language
publication

06:28.041 --> 06:29.707
of "Eat Pray Love."

06:29.743 --> 06:31.108
I'm kidding. It's
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

06:31.144 --> 06:33.176
- Obviously.
- Where do they land on the map?

06:33.212 --> 06:34.578
Still don't know,

06:34.614 --> 06:36.046
but we think it's
a simple book code.

06:36.082 --> 06:39.717
The numbers represent a page
and a specific word on it.

06:39.753 --> 06:41.251
So what's the problem?

06:41.287 --> 06:43.787
Well, the 1884 First Edition
<i>en Francais</i>

06:43.823 --> 06:45.890
has not been digitized
as of yet...

06:45.926 --> 06:47.190
...and we're
having a bitty, bitty problem

06:47.226 --> 06:49.025
securing a physical copy.

06:49.061 --> 06:50.895
I mean, I found one using
my dark web connections, but...

06:50.931 --> 06:52.263
No "but"s.
Just make it happen.

06:52.299 --> 06:53.731
We need to know where
Roman's pointing us

06:53.767 --> 06:54.731
and we need to know now.

06:54.767 --> 06:55.803
Copy that.

06:57.037 --> 06:59.306
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

07:00.974 --> 07:02.606
I know
your comms didn't fail.

07:02.642 --> 07:04.609
I switched them out
for new ones

07:04.645 --> 07:05.912
after Zapata's
glitched at the gala.

07:07.313 --> 07:10.046
I passed out.

07:10.082 --> 07:11.948
I've been getting
these headaches

07:11.984 --> 07:13.950
and feeling really tired,

07:13.986 --> 07:15.753
but today is
the first time that I...

07:15.789 --> 07:17.287
Jane, we gotta go
to the doctor.

07:17.323 --> 07:18.755
No, Patterson, I'm...

07:18.791 --> 07:20.126
I'm pretty sure
I know what it is.

07:22.328 --> 07:23.928
There it is.

07:23.964 --> 07:26.296
My entire career
officially erased

07:26.332 --> 07:28.899
with one flick
of the wrist.

07:28.935 --> 07:30.900
These papers don't erase
all the good you've done.

07:30.936 --> 07:33.239
Sure feels like it.

07:35.207 --> 07:37.073
So what now?

07:37.109 --> 07:40.645
Now? Now I have 14 hours of
facing the music with the CIA.

07:40.681 --> 07:42.282
Your tribunal's today?

07:44.750 --> 07:46.650
Look, everything'll
be all right.

07:46.686 --> 07:48.318
Thanks.

07:48.354 --> 07:51.054
But I'm not sure
it's going to be.

07:51.090 --> 07:53.026
They backed me
into a corner, Reade.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.397
I'm not sure this is
the right time for us.

07:59.765 --> 08:01.097
Wait, what?
So, so that's it?

08:01.133 --> 08:02.666
I don't get a say
in this?

08:02.702 --> 08:04.772
You're my best friend
and I love you.

08:07.707 --> 08:09.272
But I don't want to lose you

08:09.308 --> 08:10.977
because we tried this
at the wrong time.

08:12.846 --> 08:14.111
You know I'm right.

08:14.147 --> 08:15.783
Don't talk like this is
something we agree on.

08:19.385 --> 08:20.887
I'm sorry.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.282
Something wrong?

08:51.318 --> 08:52.883
Yeah, Blake's lawyer
just got here

08:52.919 --> 08:54.051
and we have no idea
where Crawford is.

08:54.087 --> 08:55.418
Where we at?

08:55.454 --> 08:56.487
Game-planning
how to flip Blake.

08:56.523 --> 08:58.189
What do you mean?

08:58.225 --> 08:59.889
We have a mountain of evidence
against her father.

08:59.925 --> 09:01.425
- Just drop it in front of her.
- Weller nixed that.

09:01.461 --> 09:02.759
I don't want Crawford's
family lawyer

09:02.795 --> 09:04.360
seeing one bit
of what we got.

09:04.396 --> 09:06.030
Woulda been really nice to know
that before I put together

09:06.066 --> 09:07.764
two color-coded
and collated dossiers.

09:09.401 --> 09:11.502
We tell Blake who her boyfriend
"Tom" really is.

09:11.538 --> 09:13.838
- Won't work.
- Why not?

09:13.874 --> 09:15.906
Blake's in love with Tom.

09:15.942 --> 09:18.242
So, she loves him,
but does he love her?

09:18.278 --> 09:19.346
Maybe we can use that.

09:22.249 --> 09:24.447
Your father is a
terrorist and a murderer.

09:24.483 --> 09:26.450
This isn't a
fishing expedition.

09:26.486 --> 09:28.118
We have proof.

09:28.154 --> 09:30.354
And when we find him,
we'll charge him

09:30.390 --> 09:31.955
to the fullest extent
of the law.

09:31.991 --> 09:33.791
Let me be clear.

09:33.827 --> 09:36.926
My client has no knowledge
of these alleged incidences,

09:36.962 --> 09:39.229
is not interested in aiding
your investigation,

09:39.265 --> 09:41.464
and thus will not be accepting
any deal you offer.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.004
We're not offering
your client a deal.

09:45.838 --> 09:47.271
We're offering Tom one.

09:47.307 --> 09:49.406
- Tom has nothing to do with this.
- Blake...

09:49.442 --> 09:51.108
We can tie your boyfriend
in to the attack

09:51.144 --> 09:52.810
on the UN assembly

09:52.846 --> 09:53.978
and the attempted assassination
of two world leaders.

09:54.014 --> 09:55.812
And we can prove
he was operating

09:55.848 --> 09:57.147
under your father's orders.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.883
The only reason
we're even considering

09:58.919 --> 10:00.283
giving Tom a deal

10:00.319 --> 10:01.886
is because we were able
to stop both attacks

10:01.922 --> 10:03.487
and your father's
a bigger target.

10:03.523 --> 10:05.221
Your father uses
people, Blake.

10:05.257 --> 10:06.824
Then, he leaves them
in the cold

10:06.860 --> 10:08.425
or he throws them
under the bus.

10:08.461 --> 10:10.960
He did that
to an FBI director already.

10:10.996 --> 10:12.963
I'm pretty sure he's gonna
do that to your boyfriend.

10:12.999 --> 10:15.365
And he did it to you,
his own daughter.

10:15.401 --> 10:18.134
You were a bait-and-switch
so he could get away.

10:18.170 --> 10:21.504
You can't save your dad.
You can still save Tom.

10:21.540 --> 10:22.876
I think we're done here.

10:24.443 --> 10:26.012
A deal for Tom
is not enough.

10:27.547 --> 10:30.181
I need assurance that my father
will be brought in alive

10:30.217 --> 10:32.016
and that he'll have
the chance to clear his name.

10:32.052 --> 10:33.416
Blake, we need
to speak private...

10:33.452 --> 10:35.552
I need to protect our family
and our shareholders.

10:35.588 --> 10:37.588
Millions of people
rely on the work we do,

10:37.624 --> 10:40.461
and I refuse to sit by
and watch it all fall apart.

10:42.962 --> 10:44.862
Do we have a deal or not?

10:44.898 --> 10:47.263
We'll do everything
we can.

10:47.299 --> 10:48.599
Where is he?

10:48.635 --> 10:51.172
He fled the country
on a friend's jet.

10:53.439 --> 10:55.004
The plane just arrived

10:55.040 --> 10:56.574
at a private airfield
outside Cape Town.

10:56.610 --> 10:58.274
Why would Crawford
fly to South Africa?

10:58.310 --> 11:00.009
They don't have
non-extradition status.

11:00.045 --> 11:01.277
Maybe he's not running.

11:01.313 --> 11:02.546
Maybe it's
unfinished business.

11:02.582 --> 11:03.881
I'll call
the State Security Agency

11:03.917 --> 11:05.148
and coordinate operations.

11:05.184 --> 11:06.550
<i>Voila!</i>

11:06.586 --> 11:07.618
"The Count of Monte Cristo"!

11:07.654 --> 11:09.052
You ready?

11:09.088 --> 11:11.421
Page 195,
word 176, <i>"mille."</i>

11:11.457 --> 11:14.190
Page 408, word 40, <i>"vie."</i>

11:14.226 --> 11:17.194
Page 61,
word 118, <i>"roi."</i>

11:17.230 --> 11:19.229
Which roughly translates to
"thousand life king,"

11:19.265 --> 11:21.331
and I think that should be
my nickname from here on in.

11:21.367 --> 11:24.033
It points to Cape Town,
South Africa.

11:24.069 --> 11:25.902
That can't be a coincidence.

11:25.938 --> 11:27.638
Roman's there too.
I know it.

11:27.674 --> 11:30.173
South Africa is where
this all started,

11:30.209 --> 11:31.611
and now he's bringing me
home to finish it.

11:33.078 --> 11:34.414
Let's move.

11:42.289 --> 11:43.988
Yeah. Is Blake okay?

11:44.024 --> 11:45.656
She's fine.
They couldn't hold her.

11:45.692 --> 11:47.190
But they know
about the plane.

11:47.226 --> 11:48.361
Oh...

11:49.962 --> 11:51.094
It doesn't matter.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.329
They won't get here
in time.

11:52.365 --> 11:54.464
Let this go.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.934
Come home,
turn yourself in.

11:56.970 --> 11:59.335
We will put together the best
defense team money can buy.

11:59.371 --> 12:00.604
<i>No.
It's too late for that.</i>

12:00.640 --> 12:02.940
I tracked Tom's phone
to this hotel.

12:02.976 --> 12:04.508
I'm gonna find out
which room he's in,

12:04.544 --> 12:06.380
and then I'm gonna...

12:10.683 --> 12:12.886
Let me save you
some time, Hank.

12:26.184 --> 12:28.150
Jane?

12:28.186 --> 12:29.820
Yeah.

12:29.856 --> 12:32.221
I said this is Nelson Coetzee,
our SSA liaison officer.

12:32.257 --> 12:33.722
Welcome to South Africa.

12:33.758 --> 12:36.292
I work for
the Director-General.

12:36.328 --> 12:37.760
You have his and
the Agency's full support.

12:37.796 --> 12:39.462
Thank you.

12:39.498 --> 12:41.297
I understand this is a bit
of a homecoming for you.

12:46.905 --> 12:49.438
Yeah. I guess it is.

12:49.474 --> 12:52.478
Good, follow me.
I have a car for us.

13:04.490 --> 13:05.491
Hey.

13:09.362 --> 13:10.460
You okay?

13:10.496 --> 13:12.499
I don't know yet.

13:13.665 --> 13:17.533
Kurt, I need to tell you
something.

13:17.569 --> 13:20.336
My comms didn't go out
during Blake's takedown.

13:20.372 --> 13:21.775
I passed out.

13:23.843 --> 13:25.374
I think...

13:25.410 --> 13:27.179
I think I'm pregnant.

13:30.248 --> 13:32.515
Um...

13:32.551 --> 13:34.216
Did you take a test?

13:34.252 --> 13:37.590
Not yet, but what would
you think about that?

13:39.858 --> 13:41.892
This could all
be over today.

13:41.928 --> 13:43.826
I know.

13:43.862 --> 13:46.428
So I think if there's
ever been a good time

13:46.464 --> 13:50.170
to start a family,
it's now.

14:01.414 --> 14:02.913
They don't respect us.

14:02.949 --> 14:04.446
What are you talking about?

14:04.482 --> 14:05.782
Why don't <i>we</i> get to go
to South Africa?

14:05.818 --> 14:08.250
Because they need us here.

14:08.286 --> 14:10.253
Do they? I mean,
it's all in the cloud.

14:10.289 --> 14:11.922
We could do 98%
of this remotely.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.523
Or Afreen.
Afreen could do it.

14:13.559 --> 14:14.823
She's very capable.
Woods, Brianna.

14:14.859 --> 14:17.393
Okay, guys,
this should be the place.

14:17.429 --> 14:21.932
<i>The website mapped a three-meter
by three-meter square</i>

14:21.968 --> 14:23.667
<i>inside the main house.</i>

14:23.703 --> 14:25.534
<i>Oh, also, the map
does not recognize levels,</i>

14:25.570 --> 14:27.604
<i>so whatever you're looking for,
it could be on any floor.</i>

14:27.640 --> 14:29.442
I could have just told you that
from South Africa, by the way.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.685
Nelson, stay here.
Cover us.

14:41.721 --> 14:43.954
Let's check for any
trip wires or traps.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.621
There won't be any.

14:45.657 --> 14:47.660
Roman would never
destroy this place.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.369
This is our parents' home.

15:15.487 --> 15:16.786
This is it.

15:16.822 --> 15:18.625
We're inside
the 3x3 square.

15:22.627 --> 15:23.759
There.

15:23.795 --> 15:25.564
It's an arrow.

15:27.933 --> 15:29.236
Upstairs.

15:44.382 --> 15:47.953
I think this was our room.
Mine and Roman's.

16:12.011 --> 16:14.447
Old habits die hard
and they all start somewhere.

16:19.584 --> 16:21.021
There's something
in the chamber.

16:30.463 --> 16:31.760
Is that...?

16:31.796 --> 16:32.998
My family.

16:38.471 --> 16:40.836
Why is Roman doing this?

16:40.872 --> 16:44.908
He wants to remind me
of what we used to be.

16:44.944 --> 16:46.442
What we lost.

16:46.478 --> 16:47.777
But what does it all lead to?

16:47.813 --> 16:49.482
A reckoning.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.782
He's bringing me
back to the beginning

16:52.818 --> 16:54.087
before he takes me
to the end.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.889
Does the name "Xander"
mean anything?

17:00.925 --> 17:04.761
It's engraved on the gun
with the number 21718.

17:04.797 --> 17:07.896
Maybe Roman killed Xander
and took his gun.

17:07.933 --> 17:11.905
No, Xander's not a person.
It's a place.

17:13.637 --> 17:14.973
Now we need to find it.

17:19.645 --> 17:20.914
Welcome back.

17:22.946 --> 17:24.684
Do you know
where you are?

17:25.818 --> 17:27.383
Tom...

17:27.419 --> 17:28.521
Don't call me that.

17:31.589 --> 17:32.956
Look closely.

17:32.992 --> 17:35.795
I'm sure you'll recognize it
from the blueprints.

17:38.798 --> 17:40.397
This used to be
an orphanage.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.498
This is where my sister
and I were taken

17:42.534 --> 17:43.766
after our parents
were murdered.

17:43.802 --> 17:46.503
This place made us
who we are.

17:46.539 --> 17:50.076
The pain, the violence,
it all started here.

17:55.815 --> 17:58.084
And now I'm gonna kill
the man who built it.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.682
Something wrong, Hank?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.617
I liked you better
with your accent, Tom.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.523
I'll bet you did.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.825
My name's not Tom Jakeman.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.559
It's Roman Briggs.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.827
And before that,

18:17.863 --> 18:19.829
when I was a boy
in this orphanage,

18:19.865 --> 18:21.865
it was Eon Kruger.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.035
My life fell apart
two years ago,

18:25.071 --> 18:28.038
my family shattered
beyond repair.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.506
I was on the run,

18:29.542 --> 18:31.240
so I decided
to come back here

18:31.276 --> 18:34.010
to find out
who was responsible

18:34.046 --> 18:35.846
for what I had become.

18:35.882 --> 18:42.189
See, that's when I first heard
the name "Hank Crawford."

18:44.556 --> 18:47.257
You built this place,
you son of a bitch.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.860
50 million soldiers who don't
serve country or cause.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.596
Where do you get
that many people

18:52.632 --> 18:53.930
with no loyalty
to any country?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.198
It was a trial run,
wasn't it?

18:55.234 --> 18:56.900
An early test.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.035
"Building an army of soldiers
loyal to no nation,"

18:59.071 --> 19:00.871
just like the one
you want to build now.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.507
Well, I built
something too, Hank.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.276
It took me two years
to figure out how,

19:06.312 --> 19:08.511
and I almost abandoned it

19:08.547 --> 19:12.749
because of my feelings
for Blake...

19:12.785 --> 19:14.617
and for you.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.152
You still can.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.888
No. No, your love
and loyalty is,

19:18.924 --> 19:20.757
and always will be,
transactional,

19:20.793 --> 19:23.026
just like the woman who
rescued me from this place.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.162
Well, we have time
for one last transaction.

19:26.198 --> 19:31.238
You get a quick death
and I get to know why.

19:32.837 --> 19:34.203
Why?

19:34.239 --> 19:40.544
Did you know the full extent
of what this place was,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.945
what they were doing to us?

19:42.981 --> 19:44.651
Did you know?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.019
I knew everything.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.020
Every detail.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.293
This was my passion project.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.629
1-8, Xander 2-1-7-1-8.

20:00.665 --> 20:01.964
Anything in the archives?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.967
No! Shocking that
a secret torture orphanage

20:04.003 --> 20:05.568
was not kept
on the books.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.770
Okay, Jane said that Xander

20:07.806 --> 20:09.606
was run
by apartheid soldiers,

20:09.642 --> 20:10.973
so there's a good chance

20:11.009 --> 20:12.142
that the building
we're looking for

20:12.178 --> 20:13.577
is owned
by the National Party.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.045
Yeah, but that
could be anything.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.180
A government building,
hospital, church, school...

20:17.216 --> 20:18.882
These archives
do not cut it,

20:18.918 --> 20:21.017
and 2-1-7-1-8
does not show up anywhere.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.985
That's it.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.721
The South Africans
may not have put

20:24.757 --> 20:26.589
the orphanage on the books,
but what if we did?

20:26.625 --> 20:27.656
We? You mean, like...?

20:27.692 --> 20:29.259
The U.S. Army.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.894
We have Shepherd's
military history.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.866
There.

20:37.902 --> 20:40.036
File number 2-1-7-1-8.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.905
The nature of the op
is redacted,

20:42.941 --> 20:45.141
but the location isn't.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.042
An abandoned military base

20:47.078 --> 20:49.179
just a few miles from
the Kruger family estate.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.881
That must be where Shepherd
rescued Jane and Roman,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.317
the place
they came to know as Xander.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.921
Thank you for your honesty.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.089
I was expecting you
to... to lie

21:00.125 --> 21:02.092
to try to escape
what's coming.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.359
I don't run.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.061
Yeah, well, you might've
if you grew up here.

21:06.097 --> 21:07.631
It was a nightmare.

21:07.667 --> 21:11.033
I'm sorry
for what you went through.

21:11.069 --> 21:15.038
This orphanage was meant
to be the seed

21:15.074 --> 21:18.775
that grew into the tree
that shaded the entire world.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.110
Then why didn't you fix it?

21:21.146 --> 21:23.046
We were children.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.780
Why didn't you help us?

21:24.816 --> 21:27.083
Because I was
on a mission.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.121
And sometimes our missions
turn us into monsters.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.690
How many others did you hurt
along the way, Tom?

21:33.726 --> 21:36.192
How many lives
did you destroy?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.632
Are we really so different?

21:41.167 --> 21:44.401
No. We're not.

21:44.437 --> 21:49.338
Imagine what we could
build together.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.206
I mean, look at you.

21:51.242 --> 21:55.811
You are the greatest thing
I have ever made.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.713
I am so proud of you, son.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.385
Whoo, no!

22:02.188 --> 22:03.286
Don't you call me that.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.887
I'm not your son.

22:04.923 --> 22:06.423
I'm not anyone's son.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.128
We used to sleep
in this room.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.263
Too many kids
on too few cots

22:14.299 --> 22:16.165
so that we'd have to fight
for the beds.

22:16.201 --> 22:17.901
Don't! Stop it!

22:19.738 --> 22:21.837
The first time I killed someone
was in this room.

22:25.009 --> 22:28.748
And now maybe
it'll be the last.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.054
What is it?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.160
The FBI.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.962
I didn't think
they'd be here so soon.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.000
This place is a labyrinth.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.172
It's clear on my right.

22:59.778 --> 23:01.314
Get on your knees.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.950
Give me your gun.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.049
The FBI is here.

23:07.085 --> 23:10.185
If you want out of this place,
you need my help.

23:10.221 --> 23:11.320
Stop talking.

23:11.356 --> 23:12.387
I can hold them off

23:12.423 --> 23:13.522
and give you time
to escape.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.826
I'm dead anyway, right?

23:16.862 --> 23:19.261
It's over for me.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.830
They catch me,
I am not spending

23:21.866 --> 23:23.266
the rest of my life
in prison.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.868
Why would you want
to help me?

23:25.904 --> 23:26.972
Oh...

23:28.106 --> 23:30.743
Fate brought us together.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.811
Not once, but twice.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.080
First through
this orphanage.

23:38.116 --> 23:41.550
And then, after you worked
so hard to find me,

23:41.586 --> 23:43.286
through Blake.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.954
Whatever lies you told,

23:45.990 --> 23:48.127
I know your love for her
is real, I see that.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.261
And however much
you hate me,

23:52.297 --> 23:55.397
I know you believe
in my vision.

23:55.433 --> 23:59.102
Find Blake.
Tell her everything.

23:59.138 --> 24:03.176
Finish what I started
together.

24:07.912 --> 24:09.913
Whoa, Crawford's cell
just went live.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.247
He's texting somebody.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.281
Doesn't he know
we have warrants

24:12.317 --> 24:13.383
to monitor his activity?

24:13.419 --> 24:14.850
Apparently he doesn't care.

24:14.886 --> 24:15.888
Tracing the call now.

24:17.288 --> 24:19.321
Guys, Crawford is
in your building.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.023
Where?

24:21.059 --> 24:24.059
I don't know, but is that SSA
liaison still with you?

24:24.095 --> 24:25.427
He's right behind us.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.863
We just intercepted
a text from Crawford

24:26.899 --> 24:28.597
to the Director-General
of the SSA.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.902
<i>The officer
you're with is...</i>

24:33.372 --> 24:34.440
Weller's hit!

24:38.745 --> 24:40.277
- I'm okay.
- Kurt!

24:40.313 --> 24:42.313
Kurt!

24:42.349 --> 24:43.848
I'm fine.

24:43.884 --> 24:45.315
It went straight through.
Go get Roman and Crawford.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.017
- No, you're...
- We gotta stop them.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.286
This is our only chance,
so go get 'em.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.392
Go, Jane.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.435
FBI. Hank Crawford,
you're under arrest.

25:04.471 --> 25:06.641
Turn around. Slowly.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.378
Drop the gun!

25:13.414 --> 25:15.446
I think you know
I can't do that.

25:15.482 --> 25:17.314
You don't have a choice.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.716
It's over.

25:18.752 --> 25:20.555
Now where is Roman?

25:22.055 --> 25:23.621
I don't know anybody
by that name.

25:23.657 --> 25:25.723
Tom! My brother.

25:25.759 --> 25:27.262
Your brother?

25:29.495 --> 25:31.461
Well...

25:31.497 --> 25:33.331
This is a homecoming
for you too, then.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.865
Where is he?

25:34.901 --> 25:38.803
He brought you here.
He brought us all here.

25:38.839 --> 25:40.537
No.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.740
He brought you to me
because we're connected,

25:43.776 --> 25:45.279
the three of us.

26:01.128 --> 26:02.664
One last transaction.

26:04.798 --> 26:07.931
Oh, I got the gun.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.803
And he got the bullets.

26:11.105 --> 26:12.836
Then why are you smiling?

26:12.872 --> 26:16.943
I made something... great.

26:36.730 --> 26:38.429
<i>Tom, thank God!</i>

26:38.465 --> 26:39.996
Hey, I'm so sorry
I disappeared.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.431
There was something
I had to do,

26:41.467 --> 26:43.433
but I'm done now, Blake.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.835
I'm done.
I'm heading back to New York.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.437
It'll take me a minute
to get there, but...

26:46.473 --> 26:47.971
<i>Wait, no,
I'm not in New York.</i>

26:48.007 --> 26:49.707
Okay, well, tell me where
I have to be, and I'll be there.

26:49.743 --> 26:52.142
I'm here, I'm in Cape Town.
I came for you.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.577
- How did you...
- <i>It doesn't matter how.</i>

26:53.613 --> 26:55.012
Just, just tell me
where you are.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.714
I'm heading
somewhere safe.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.382
Tom, are you okay?

26:58.418 --> 26:59.984
Yeah, I am now.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.387
I'll send you a pin,
and I'll see you soon.

27:02.423 --> 27:03.891
Okay.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.591
Hey, how's Weller?

27:06.627 --> 27:07.859
Reade said he's stable.

27:07.895 --> 27:09.459
They're on their way
to the hospital now.

27:09.495 --> 27:10.727
What happened to
the satellite images?

27:10.763 --> 27:11.996
Well, the SSA is suddenly
very prickly

27:12.032 --> 27:13.730
about jurisdiction
with the whole, uh,

27:13.766 --> 27:15.466
"we killed their guy dead"
thing, so...

27:18.772 --> 27:20.505
Well, I'll be damned.

27:20.541 --> 27:22.739
Blake Crawford's cell phone
just went live in South Africa.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.475
What? She could lead us
to Roman.

27:24.511 --> 27:25.743
Give me the coordinates.

27:25.779 --> 27:26.781
We gotta get them
to Jane.

27:40.927 --> 27:41.995
Hi.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.136
Is my father with you?

27:53.240 --> 27:55.076
No, he, um...

27:57.811 --> 27:59.080
He's gone.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.681
I'm so sorry.

28:04.584 --> 28:05.819
Roman, what happened?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.121
There's...

28:10.157 --> 28:13.461
There's so much...
so much I need to tell you.

28:15.896 --> 28:16.994
I love you.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.595
That is all that matters.

28:18.631 --> 28:19.930
I want to...
I want to marry you

28:19.966 --> 28:21.468
and I want to have...

28:25.272 --> 28:27.041
Wha... What did you call me?

28:32.713 --> 28:34.782
I know everything, Roman.

28:35.983 --> 28:37.547
I know your name's not Tom.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.950
I know you lied to me.

28:39.986 --> 28:42.687
Used me because you wanted
to destroy my family.

28:42.723 --> 28:44.988
Blake...

28:45.024 --> 28:46.858
Did you kill my dad?

28:46.894 --> 28:50.026
Who told you about me?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.898
Someone I trust.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.907
Was it real?

29:05.745 --> 29:07.180
Did you love me?

29:11.284 --> 29:13.521
How could I?
I never knew you.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.758
Good-bye, Roman.

29:46.238 --> 29:48.740
Well... I'm home.

29:51.242 --> 29:54.910
I always wondered if I'd
actually make it back here.

29:54.946 --> 29:56.812
Every detail,
every decision,

29:56.848 --> 29:59.448
every... everything.

29:59.484 --> 30:01.119
All leading to this.

30:03.355 --> 30:05.487
Well, I kept my end
of the deal.

30:05.523 --> 30:07.225
Now it's your turn.

30:09.994 --> 30:12.294
All the money's yours.

30:12.330 --> 30:16.432
But I need you
to promise me that...

30:16.468 --> 30:20.368
you'll keep working,
you'll keep moving forward.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.908
Or this will have
all been for nothing.

30:45.364 --> 30:47.262
Roman...

30:47.298 --> 30:49.201
- It's too late.
- Who did this?

30:51.936 --> 30:53.972
I'm sorry.

30:55.173 --> 30:57.406
I know, I know.

30:57.442 --> 30:58.978
Me too.

31:00.179 --> 31:02.410
I never got out.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.012
I never got
out of that hole.

31:07.051 --> 31:08.788
That's not true.

31:12.223 --> 31:14.423
Here.

31:14.459 --> 31:15.825
What is it?

31:15.861 --> 31:20.362
I told you once...

31:20.398 --> 31:23.098
that I wasn't
afraid of death.

31:23.134 --> 31:24.971
That I was ready.

31:27.338 --> 31:28.540
But I'm not.

31:33.945 --> 31:35.377
I'm scared, Remi.

31:35.413 --> 31:38.047
I don't want to die
in this place

31:38.083 --> 31:39.485
alone in the dark.

31:41.619 --> 31:43.819
You're not.

31:43.855 --> 31:45.357
Roman, Roman, look at me.

31:46.490 --> 31:48.191
Okay.

31:48.227 --> 31:50.326
Look at the sun...

31:50.362 --> 31:52.298
and this tree
and the view.

31:54.900 --> 31:56.965
You're home.

31:57.001 --> 32:00.136
You made it home.

32:00.172 --> 32:01.870
And I'm right here
with you.

32:06.244 --> 32:07.879
I love you.

32:09.013 --> 32:10.982
And I will see you again.

32:12.116 --> 32:13.185
I promise.

32:57.962 --> 33:01.030
Ow. Ow!

33:01.066 --> 33:02.934
Oh...

33:05.037 --> 33:06.202
Are you sure you're okay?

33:06.238 --> 33:07.506
Yeah.

33:09.207 --> 33:10.940
Fine.

33:10.976 --> 33:12.575
South Africans that put me
back together...

33:12.611 --> 33:15.578
said things didn't
look so bad,

33:15.614 --> 33:17.914
- all things considered.
- Hmm.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.218
What about you?

33:20.318 --> 33:21.550
You want to talk?

33:21.586 --> 33:23.588
He's gone.

33:25.057 --> 33:26.592
What is there to say?

33:29.594 --> 33:31.293
He was our enemy.

33:31.329 --> 33:33.231
But he was still
your brother.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.469
I'm sorry.

33:46.243 --> 33:48.344
Oh, uh, sorry.

33:48.380 --> 33:51.117
There's something
that I need you to see.

33:52.384 --> 33:54.082
The drive's locked.

33:54.118 --> 33:55.384
When Roman gave it to you,

33:55.420 --> 33:56.619
did he happen to give you
a password?

33:56.655 --> 33:58.087
No, can you hack it?

33:58.123 --> 33:59.221
Not really.

33:59.257 --> 34:01.023
It's a swipe-pattern lock

34:01.059 --> 34:03.558
and we've only got
one shot at it.

34:03.594 --> 34:05.561
We get it wrong and the whole
thing fries itself.

34:05.597 --> 34:07.563
Why give Jane the drive
without a password?

34:07.599 --> 34:09.534
Maybe he thought
I already knew it.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.107
7-2-9-8-0.

34:19.143 --> 34:20.175
You sure?

34:20.210 --> 34:21.677
I'm positive.
Look.

34:24.282 --> 34:26.248
It's the arrow that Roman
kept drawing.

34:26.284 --> 34:27.416
It's not an arrow.

34:27.452 --> 34:28.554
It's a tree.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.326
It's Roman's tattoo cache.

34:37.362 --> 34:38.594
Part of it.

34:38.630 --> 34:40.395
Look.
There's Perseus.

34:40.431 --> 34:42.130
Then Valkyrie.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.732
And the molecule tattoo
that got Stuart killed.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.668
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be
insensitive, it's just...

34:45.704 --> 34:47.670
This is like
a greatest-hits album.

34:47.706 --> 34:49.270
But there's also
stuff on there

34:49.306 --> 34:50.672
that we've never
seen before.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.141
Well, yeah, you don't
just play the hits.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.409
You gotta try out
some new stuff.

34:53.445 --> 34:54.543
Look!
There's the passage

34:54.579 --> 34:55.610
from "The Count
of Monte Cristo"

34:55.646 --> 34:57.012
with the words
put into it.

34:57.047 --> 34:59.181
What? This helps us
solve more tattoos?

34:59.217 --> 35:00.549
It's super fragmented

35:00.585 --> 35:02.150
and some of the pieces
are missing, but...

35:02.186 --> 35:04.286
if we could find
the rest,

35:04.322 --> 35:06.325
it could help us
solve all the tattoos.

35:11.228 --> 35:13.228
You should've let me do it.

35:13.264 --> 35:15.100
No, it had to be me.

35:16.768 --> 35:19.137
I'm just glad you told me
the truth when you did.

35:20.739 --> 35:22.605
This is how we take
the power back.

35:22.641 --> 35:25.206
This is how
we change the world.

35:25.242 --> 35:27.576
I know, I'm just not sure
I'm cut out

35:27.612 --> 35:29.478
for what comes next.

35:29.514 --> 35:31.579
That's okay.

35:31.615 --> 35:33.284
I am.

35:40.257 --> 35:41.626
Whew, huh?

35:47.498 --> 35:50.465
So how did what's her name's
CIA tribunal go?

35:50.501 --> 35:53.335
Haven't heard yet.

35:53.371 --> 35:55.270
Hey, good work getting
that book, man.

35:55.306 --> 35:56.672
Mm.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.206
You know what,
don't thank me

35:58.242 --> 36:00.476
until you find out
how much it costs.

36:00.512 --> 36:02.078
How much?

36:02.114 --> 36:04.413
Why don't I top off
your drink a bit there?

36:04.449 --> 36:06.614
Talk about it
a little later.

36:06.650 --> 36:08.217
There we go.

36:14.826 --> 36:16.128
How you holding up?

36:17.661 --> 36:19.130
I don't know.

36:20.331 --> 36:22.134
Roman was my only...

36:24.668 --> 36:26.768
We're from the same place.

36:26.804 --> 36:28.670
Made of the same stuff.

36:28.706 --> 36:31.273
Sometimes it felt like...

36:31.309 --> 36:33.679
it felt like
he was one of us, too.

36:35.746 --> 36:38.514
Because no matter
how angry he was...

36:38.550 --> 36:40.516
he still gave his life to...

36:45.757 --> 36:47.723
No! Jane!

36:47.759 --> 36:49.257
Jane.

37:06.577 --> 37:08.143
Yeah?

37:08.179 --> 37:10.411
<i>Any change since we left?</i>

37:10.447 --> 37:12.148
No.

37:12.184 --> 37:13.315
She's still unconscious.

37:13.351 --> 37:15.186
<i>You need to come back in.</i>

37:17.355 --> 37:20.723
Roman's thumb drive doesn't
just hold tattoo information.

37:20.759 --> 37:23.391
There's medical intel
on there as well.

37:23.427 --> 37:24.927
It's incomplete
just like the tattoos.

37:24.963 --> 37:26.462
Clearly, Roman didn't
want to keep

37:26.498 --> 37:27.730
everything in one place.

37:27.766 --> 37:29.401
So what'd you find?

37:30.802 --> 37:32.601
Kurt, you might want
to sit down for this.

37:32.637 --> 37:34.235
Just tell me.

37:34.271 --> 37:35.737
It looks like
Jane is suffering

37:35.773 --> 37:37.605
from some kind of
a ZIP poisoning.

37:37.641 --> 37:39.375
What?

37:39.411 --> 37:41.610
It's the drug they used
to erase Jane's memory, it...

37:41.646 --> 37:42.811
I know what ZIP is.

37:42.847 --> 37:44.913
Sandstorm flooded
her body with it

37:44.949 --> 37:46.614
before they sent her to us.

37:46.650 --> 37:48.616
I think that's what's been
causing the dizziness,

37:48.652 --> 37:51.386
the nausea, the fatigue,

37:51.422 --> 37:54.389
all the stuff that made her
think she was pregnant.

37:54.425 --> 37:55.924
There's a whole
section on this drive

37:55.960 --> 37:58.427
about side effects...
hallucinations,

37:58.463 --> 38:00.929
massive memory lapses,
memory relapses,

38:00.965 --> 38:02.797
brain aneurysms.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.632
Roman was
suffering from it, too.

38:04.668 --> 38:06.835
He was trying to cure it.

38:06.871 --> 38:09.505
What do you mean, cure it?

38:09.541 --> 38:13.509
According
to Roman's research,

38:13.545 --> 38:15.311
the progression is not
very good.

38:15.347 --> 38:18.313
And I-I think we need
to prepare ourselves

38:18.349 --> 38:20.315
for this to get
a whole lot worse.

38:20.351 --> 38:21.983
But there's
still some hope here.

38:22.019 --> 38:25.520
We think that
Roman gave Jane the drive

38:25.556 --> 38:27.790
as some sort of treasure map.

38:27.826 --> 38:30.826
And we know that there are
some pieces missing,

38:30.862 --> 38:33.529
but it seems to point
to other drives

38:33.565 --> 38:35.797
hidden in other places
all over the world.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.398
If they're anything
like this one,

38:37.434 --> 38:39.802
they'll have more tattoo clues
and more medical data

38:39.838 --> 38:41.869
for the cure that Roman
was trying to find.

38:41.905 --> 38:46.674
Finding Roman's
drives could stop more crimes.

38:46.710 --> 38:48.978
But it could also mean

38:49.014 --> 38:51.717
stopping whatever is happening
to Jane's brain.

38:56.021 --> 38:57.323
Kurt?

39:47.038 --> 39:48.871
Hobbes, it's me,
it's Remi.

39:48.907 --> 39:50.906
I'm in a hospital and...

39:50.942 --> 39:53.775
I'm missing time,
I'm missing a lot of time.

39:53.811 --> 39:56.411
I need to talk to Oscar
or Roman or Shepherd.

39:56.447 --> 39:59.047
From what I can tell, I'm still
undercover with the FBI,

39:59.083 --> 40:01.482
but I can't remember anything.

40:01.518 --> 40:03.418
I don't know if
I've been compromised.

40:03.454 --> 40:04.753
I don't know if...

40:04.789 --> 40:06.057
I need help.

40:07.659 --> 40:09.625
Ms. Doe?

40:09.661 --> 40:10.893
You're awake.

40:10.929 --> 40:12.527
What happened to me?

40:12.563 --> 40:14.496
I'm not up to speed
on the details.

40:14.532 --> 40:15.764
I'd have to check
your chart.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.632
You're not my doctor?

40:17.668 --> 40:19.802
No, I'm your husband's.

40:19.838 --> 40:22.541
You are Kurt Weller's
wife, correct?

40:23.807 --> 40:25.107
Yeah.

40:25.143 --> 40:26.942
I'm afraid there's been
a serious complication

40:26.978 --> 40:28.444
with his gunshot wound.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.511
The bullet caused
an intra-abdominal abscess

40:30.547 --> 40:32.514
which his doctors overseas
must have missed.

40:32.550 --> 40:35.083
He's in between
surgeries right now.

40:35.119 --> 40:38.520
But I need to tell you,
it's not good.

40:38.556 --> 40:40.389
Would you like to see him?

40:40.425 --> 40:41.924
Yes, I would.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.096
Come on.
Your friends are waiting.

40:50.768 --> 40:51.903
Jane...

40:54.005 --> 40:55.407
I'm so sorry.

40:59.643 --> 41:01.009
Is he going to be okay?

41:01.045 --> 41:02.614
They don't know yet.

41:05.617 --> 41:07.449
Here, come
have a seat.

41:07.485 --> 41:08.554
Come on.

41:16.661 --> 41:18.030
You can take his hand, Jane.

41:32.777 --> 41:34.742
Are you sure
this will work?

41:34.778 --> 41:36.645
I'm positive.

41:36.681 --> 41:38.012
I'll infiltrate
their ranks,

41:38.048 --> 41:39.882
get them to trust me,

41:39.918 --> 41:43.389
and then I'll rip them apart
from the inside.

41:48.226 --> 41:49.757
It's okay.

41:49.793 --> 41:52.530
We'll get through
this... together.
