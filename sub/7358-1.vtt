"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Stars Desert Inn Hotel, Las Vegas,

01:24.251 --> 01:27.546
presents the final performance

01:27.713 --> 01:31.717
of the incomparable
singing sensation,

01:31.884 --> 01:33.719
Miss Deloris Van Cartier."

02:41.078 --> 02:44.790
But my mama told me,
you better shop around!

02:45.374 --> 02:48.002
So that's what I did. I shopped.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.337
I shopped and I shopped.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.007
And I found something special.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.427
I got myself a brand-new hustle.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.584
See how they treat me?
He got my cousin, he got my coat.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.003
When I tried to get it back,
he whipped out this...

03:56.153 --> 03:57.780
Magic!

04:00.032 --> 04:02.493
You know this song. Let's sing.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.419
She's coming!

04:22.429 --> 04:25.182
These are my friends.
Ladies, sing this for me.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.146
Come up and join us. Come on, come on.
And hurry up. Ladies!

04:43.534 --> 04:44.535
Look out!

04:56.463 --> 04:57.548
What you doing?

05:25.034 --> 05:27.119
Thank you!

05:27.536 --> 05:29.621
You were fantastic!

05:30.289 --> 05:31.915
Oh, my! Nice outfit.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.001
Glad I didn't wear mine.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.503
That last bit was great.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.631
I'm a big fan. I got your album.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.134
This is my manager, Joey.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.805
- What do you want?
- Are you represented?

05:46.972 --> 05:50.059
They're nuns. God represents them.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.896
Can God get you your own
dressing room? You were great.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.105
She taught me to sing.

05:55.272 --> 05:59.526
I am so glad to see you guys.
What are you doing here?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.570
We came to see you.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.530
Staying a long time?

06:03.697 --> 06:07.368
We'll be back on the road tonight.
We don't have any time to chat.

06:07.534 --> 06:12.289
Maybe a little chat. But we do have
to get back. We're teachers now.

06:13.499 --> 06:17.836
It's all because of you. You inspired
us to go out into the community

06:18.003 --> 06:21.298
and do some good in the hood.
Oh, my!

06:22.257 --> 06:25.427
Can I get you guys something?
Sit down.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.182
Can they even hear you in the back
of the room when you're teaching?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.101
I'm getting better.

06:32.267 --> 06:36.146
We're teaching at St Francis Academy
in San Francisco.

06:37.106 --> 06:41.151
I went to that school. It was...
They need good teachers.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.278
We're having a barrel of laughs.

06:43.445 --> 06:48.992
Though the kids get a little unruly.
Actually, they're out of control.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.621
It was so bad, last week, Sister Mary
Patrick frowned - twice!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.751
- Let's get down to business.
- Excuse me.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.462
- Business goes through me.
- No, excuse me.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.091
These are my friends.
I'm talking to them.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.677
- I'm talking to my friends.
- I'm your manager.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.596
- Forgive us. Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.014
Thank you.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.226
You come up here,
you come to see me. What's going on?

07:14.393 --> 07:16.145
Does Mother Superior
know you're here?

07:16.311 --> 07:18.647
She sent us on this mission to...

07:18.814 --> 07:21.275
We're not to come back without you.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.693
What does she want?

07:22.860 --> 07:23.902
We're not certain.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.614
But she needs you
and wants us to bring you back.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.741
Is she OK healthwise?

07:29.908 --> 07:32.870
She's fine. She's a little desperate.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.038
She's desperate?!

08:02.274 --> 08:04.359
<i>I'll get it! I'll get it!</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:16.121
- I'll take it.
- What?

08:16.580 --> 08:19.082
Sit, sit!

08:39.102 --> 08:40.520
Welcome.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.405
It's good to see you.

08:50.572 --> 08:55.369
Sister Mary Claren...
Oh, I do apologise. Deloris.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.081
It's so good to see you too.

08:59.248 --> 09:03.168
I'm sorry I couldn't
join the sisters in Las Vegas.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.296
I've heard you are truly a spectacle.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.840
Well, I work at it.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.844
You're probably wondering
why I asked the sisters to bring you.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.639
I am curious. What's all the mystery?

09:16.306 --> 09:21.061
Well, you see, Deloris,
we need your help here...

09:23.230 --> 09:25.190
at St Francis.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.278
We seem to have got in
slightly over our heads.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.073
What... do you want?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.410
Help us by becoming a teacher.

09:37.703 --> 09:43.584
A teacher? Me? Oh, no!
I'm not cut out to be a teacher.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.669
Who would I teach?
What would I teach?

09:45.836 --> 09:48.839
Teach the children. Teach music.

09:49.006 --> 09:53.510
You weren't cut out to be a nun
either, but at St Katherine's

09:53.677 --> 09:57.055
you brought a new spirit
into the convent and the community.

09:57.222 --> 10:01.560
You were... infectious.
You could be as infectious here.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.521
You're making me
sound like a disease.

10:04.688 --> 10:10.652
We are struggling with a community
that is tired, worn and despairing.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.656
We saw this school
as some sort of renewal.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.243
But it's becoming
a hopeless situation.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.999
We have nowhere else to turn.
We are desperate women, Deloris.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.879
- We need you.
- I'm...

10:29.046 --> 10:31.089
Think of the children.

10:31.965 --> 10:37.346
We must invest in their future.
And who better to help us than you?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.514
I'm a lounge singer.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.433
You are the perfect example

10:41.600 --> 10:46.772
of how a sow's ear
can be turned into a silk purse.

10:50.025 --> 10:53.528
Well, I probably wouldn't
have put it quite like that.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.907
I mean, my career's
started to take off.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.409
I want to get into my success.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.412
A success you might not have had

11:02.579 --> 11:08.168
without the help of supportive
friends who shall remain nameless.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.588
So you're gonna be like that
with the guilt?

11:11.755 --> 11:16.551
Guilt? I would never use guilt.
I'm a nun.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.805
All right, I'll do it for you.

11:19.971 --> 11:23.475
Thank you.
I knew we could count on you.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.185
You're talking about a week?

11:25.352 --> 11:30.440
I don't think we should restrict
ourselves to a time frame.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.651
Sisters!

11:35.779 --> 11:38.949
Deloris has agreed
to join our teaching staff.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.827
Could you take her
to the changing room?

11:41.993 --> 11:44.496
Sure. Absolutely.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.083
Tell me why I'm
dressed like this again.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.585
The fathers here are very strict.

11:50.752 --> 11:55.132
If they found out you weren't a nun
or a teacher, they might...

11:55.298 --> 11:57.467
- Ask me to leave?
- In a New York minute.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.636
Now I'm undercover again.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.180
- It could be fun.
- Convent living's grim.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.641
All I need's a bed
and a place to kneel.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.310
Wait till you see
what we have in the room for you!

12:07.477 --> 12:11.398
You didn't do something silly!
What did you put in it, a bidet?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.859
- A bi-what?
- Never mind. What is it?

12:14.025 --> 12:15.819
A watched pot never boils. Wait.

12:15.986 --> 12:19.322
- Don't tell her. It's a surprise.
- Oh, come on.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.367
One, two, three.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.419
Curtains!

12:35.505 --> 12:38.717
Sometimes it resembles
a battleground at recess.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.928
Mostly, the kids are well behaved.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.850
A new nun.

12:47.017 --> 12:51.938
Sister Mary something or other.
I'm terrible with names.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.649
- Who was that?
- The older one is our principal.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.987
Father Maurice.
The other is Mr Crisp.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.072
He's only been here a few months.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.909
I think I've seen her
somewhere before.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.786
Just long enough to hate us.

13:05.952 --> 13:10.457
The kids call him the devil.
He's just got the grumps.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.543
I don't care who he is. I just want
to put the top up on my car.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.629
If there's a car left.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.173
What did she mean? Is that a joke?

13:18.507 --> 13:22.677
I'd like you to join me
in welcoming the new addition

13:22.844 --> 13:26.223
to the teaching staff,
Sister Mary...

13:26.389 --> 13:28.433
Clarence.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.021
Who will be teaching our...

13:33.188 --> 13:36.733
- Music.
- Is there still a music class?

13:36.900 --> 13:40.904
- In a manner of speaking.
- Why is he asking that?

13:41.071 --> 13:45.826
Sister Mary Clarence
will be teaching our music class.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.750
Now, I think each of you
should introduce yourselves.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.460
I'll start.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.129
I'm Father Ignatius. I teach math.

13:59.714 --> 14:03.009
<i>I'm Thomas. Ave, magistra nova.</i>

14:04.135 --> 14:06.179
- Latin teacher.
- Oh, good.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.347
Excuse me.

14:07.514 --> 14:12.102
This is Mr Crisp.
This is Sister Mary Clarence.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.312
Oh, yes, the new nun.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.775
Sister Mary Clemens.

14:19.985 --> 14:25.657
Clarence. Like in Thomas.
I'm the music teacher.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.909
The music teacher. Music?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.995
You're gripping me-

14:30.161 --> 14:32.080
Oh, yes. Sorry.

14:32.247 --> 14:35.417
Yes, I just stopped by

14:35.584 --> 14:39.546
to remind you
of our meeting this afternoon.

14:40.463 --> 14:44.551
Well, pardon the intrusion,
and bon appÃ©tit.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.054
<i>Gruss Gott.</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:49.598
This is Father Wolfgang.

14:49.764 --> 14:56.563
Who cooks so diligently
to minister to our dietary needs.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.900
For luncheon,
Bratwurst a la Provence.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.613
He only knows how to cook one thing.
German sausage.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.490
Liverwurst, Bratwurst, Bierwurst.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.117
It's the worst!

15:10.619 --> 15:11.786
Oh, no, no!

15:12.787 --> 15:15.457
Jenny Craig. I just couldn't.
Thank you.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.595
This... needs a prayer.

15:41.608 --> 15:46.738
Sister Clarence, I wonder if I could
have a word with you in private.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.990
No, I need to...

15:49.157 --> 15:50.283
No, please.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.496
Sure.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.167
Thank you.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.424
Won't you sit down?

16:06.675 --> 16:10.095
The sisters tell me your last posting

16:10.261 --> 16:15.183
was at a women's prison facility
in the Louisiana bayou.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.686
- What?
- It wasn't?

16:17.852 --> 16:21.022
No, no, it was, it was.
Yes, of course.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.859
The prison was really rough on me.

16:25.026 --> 16:31.157
I'm trying to wipe this experience
from my mind. It was so traumatic.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.451
- Really?
- Yes.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.746
They led me to believe
that you enjoyed it.

16:36.913 --> 16:41.126
Well, yes, I did. It was a traumatic
enjoyment of an experience

16:41.292 --> 16:46.423
that I should not have had
and appreciated because I'm a nun.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.384
Nuns are not meant to have
enjoyable experiences

16:49.551 --> 16:52.887
because they lead to
all kinds of situations,

16:53.054 --> 16:57.350
which is why I'm here.
I know you understand that.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.978
Well, I do see what you mean.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.896
I knew you would.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.941
As I do with all my new teachers,

17:05.108 --> 17:09.362
I'd like to share
my theories about education,

17:09.529 --> 17:14.242
gleaned from my years
of experience as the principal.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.453
I am an open book.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.913
Discipline.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.005
Anything else to go with that?
That's it? Discipline?

17:27.172 --> 17:32.260
Unfortunately, that's all
we can expect here. Any questions?

17:34.512 --> 17:38.892
No, I feel as though
I have absorbed all I can from you.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.186
Well, then.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.314
I wish you good day...

17:44.481 --> 17:46.399
and good luck.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.320
Thank you, Your Eminenceship.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.620
OK.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.331
Your Royal Pappyness.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.377
- Piece of work, isn't he?
- A prison?

18:06.544 --> 18:09.756
You lied to me
and you're gonna go to hell!

18:14.928 --> 18:19.224
Vocant.
They call, are calling, do call.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.475
<i>Voco.</i>

18:20.642 --> 18:22.644
I call, am calling, do call.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.814
Vocas. You call, are calling,

18:25.980 --> 18:28.024
do call. Voco...

18:31.486 --> 18:35.448
Class? Eyes up, pencils down,
mouths closed.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.994
We'll learn a lesson
and have fun doing it. The topic:

18:40.328 --> 18:44.207
promiscuity.
Who can tell me what that means?

18:44.541 --> 18:46.084
Sandra!

18:46.251 --> 18:48.253
In your dreams.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.172
Sandra, I know you have a question.

18:51.339 --> 18:54.551
You can't answer questions
about sex.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.556
You don't have to bite the doughnut
to know it's sweet.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.641
Plus, we have the Bible.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.146
Sister Mary Clarence? You look lost.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.564
Yes.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.649
VVho isn't?
Can't find the music room?

19:09.816 --> 19:10.859
No.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.904
It's downstairs.
Take a left, right, right, left...

19:15.071 --> 19:17.907
I'm sorry. It's tricky.
I'll help you find it.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.452
Just follow me.
I'll show you where it is.

19:21.619 --> 19:25.707
I know exactly what you mean.
One hall looks like another.

19:25.874 --> 19:31.754
Sometimes I just stop in my tracks
and say, "Lord, come to my rescue."

19:33.256 --> 19:35.341
Watch your step.

19:35.758 --> 19:40.388
Here we are. It's the... music

19:40.555 --> 19:42.640
class!

19:44.100 --> 19:46.060
Well... thank you.

19:46.227 --> 19:51.691
Oh... remember - nothing ever
is as bad as it seems at first.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.111
Fight the good fight.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.572
<i>OK. Sursum corda.</i>

19:57.739 --> 19:59.240
What was that?

19:59.407 --> 20:02.619
It's Latin.
It means lift up your heart.

20:02.785 --> 20:06.456
I thought you said,
"Insert some quarters."

20:06.623 --> 20:08.082
I'm not cut out for this.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.584
You're joking me.

20:09.751 --> 20:13.046
- The children are waiting.
- Yeah! Ain't they?!

20:22.472 --> 20:26.726
That's why your mama DJs
for the ice-cream float.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.812
Oh, it's you!

20:31.814 --> 20:33.983
Thank heaven you're here.

20:34.150 --> 20:38.321
Class, this is your new teacher.
Sister Mary Clarence.

20:38.488 --> 20:43.117
Your mama is so fat, she sat on
a rainbow and skittles popped out.

20:44.744 --> 20:50.166
Congratulations. You're the
new mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.088
That's why your mother's so fat.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.095
Keep the faith, sister.

21:02.262 --> 21:06.057
Remember, Our Lord said,
"Be ye strong of will."

21:06.224 --> 21:08.393
Ye better be tough as nails too.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.437
Yeah!

21:28.871 --> 21:34.711
Morning. I'd like to introduce
myself. Put your seats back in order.

21:43.761 --> 21:48.057
I don't like a lot of noise,
so maybe you could do it quietly?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.268
Thank you so much.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.855
My name is Sister Mary Clarence,
and I'm...

21:54.022 --> 21:55.023
Your mama?

21:55.189 --> 22:00.069
Let's talk about your mama, who's
so dumb she got hit by a parked car.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.324
Let's try attendance.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.909
I'd like to introduce myself.

22:07.076 --> 22:11.247
I'm Tyler Chase,
and on behalf of the music class...

22:11.414 --> 22:13.041
You got something on your nose.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.251
A big brown thing here.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.921
Thank you, Mr Chase.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.592
Richard Pincham.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.719
Wake up, fool!

22:24.886 --> 22:26.763
Paper or plastic?

22:26.929 --> 22:29.265
Pardon'? Are you Richard?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.601
Yeah.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.311
Did you do these?

22:33.478 --> 22:34.854
Yeah. Sorry.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.022
Let me see.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.317
They call me Sketch. I do sketches.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.611
These are real good.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.822
Try to stay awake in my class,
though.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.908
Wesley James.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.452
Wesley Glen James.

22:49.619 --> 22:55.249
Respectfully, James is the slave
name forced upon my ancestors.

22:55.416 --> 23:00.713
Wesley is some name my
assimilationist parents came up with.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.593
Today, in honour of those
who died in the struggle,

23:05.760 --> 23:09.972
I wish to use my true name -
Ahmal M'jomo Jamaael.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.934
Which means "He who is spirited".

23:13.101 --> 23:14.894
And long-winded.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.562
A simple "present"
would have done it.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.231
And who are you?

23:18.398 --> 23:20.149
Frankay.

23:22.402 --> 23:26.114
Hello there, miss,
let me kick an introduction

23:26.280 --> 23:28.616
Flute, violin, bass guitar...

23:28.783 --> 23:31.619
Can't you come up
with your own thing?

23:31.786 --> 23:34.914
You continually steal
my people's expressions.

23:35.081 --> 23:38.251
Jazz, rock'n'roll, now rap...
What you gonna take next?

23:38.418 --> 23:41.212
- Your girl!
- Keep talking there, boy.

23:41.379 --> 23:46.467
Let's leave this display of manhood
outside. Thank you.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.095
Hurry up. We've got things to do.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.888
Know what I'm saying?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.974
Are you Rita Watson?

23:53.141 --> 23:57.854
That's me. Sorry, I don't
have any antidotes to tell you.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.399
- Anecdotes.
- Shut up! Mind your business!

24:01.566 --> 24:03.776
How about we call you
Rita Diva-With-A'tude?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.236
Maybe I could help.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.488
- Are we all here?
- Yeah.

24:07.655 --> 24:08.781
We're here.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.368
Thank you!
All right, what have you been doing?

24:12.535 --> 24:14.454
Is she jokin'?

24:14.620 --> 24:18.791
Let me give you an easier question.
Where are the music books?

24:19.417 --> 24:21.711
Up there.

24:21.878 --> 24:26.924
I should explain something.
This is what we call a bird course.

24:27.091 --> 24:31.888
We call it a bird course
because we fly right through it.

24:33.848 --> 24:37.894
All you gotta do to pass
in this class is show up.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.983
So you come to class,
you do nothing, and you pass?

24:44.150 --> 24:48.988
No, we don't exactly do nothing.
We have a good time too.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.574
Yo, Frankie!

25:09.800 --> 25:11.886
Money? You're asking for money?

25:12.053 --> 25:16.599
Yes. The green stuff that has
pictures of dead presidents on it.

25:16.766 --> 25:20.853
You use it to buy things -
instruments or song books.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.064
Sister Mary Clemens...

25:23.814 --> 25:29.320
Mr Crisp, my name is Mary Clarence.

25:29.487 --> 25:35.952
Clarence. You're confusing St Francis
with the University of Notre Dame.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.037
There is no money here.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.873
They manage to pay you, Crispy.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.211
Mr Crisp is right.
We're lucky to be open at all.

25:45.378 --> 25:51.133
Then I wish you'd tell me what I'm
supposed to do with these children.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.687
Teach them to play... soccer.

26:03.688 --> 26:06.482
We don't have the balls for that.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.666
Now! Thank you.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.172
The question is,
how do we get this nun

27:11.339 --> 27:14.342
to extricate herself from us?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.177
Let's get this nun to run.

27:16.344 --> 27:20.431
I'm not sure. That's like
messing with a higher power.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.934
This sister is like a sister sister.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.686
She ain't no sister of yours.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.688
Chill,OK?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.523
I heard that.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.068
We gotta agree. Are we in or out?

27:32.234 --> 27:35.196
Young man! Picasso!

27:35.363 --> 27:37.573
You want to keep this job,
get back in here.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.659
I know what that means.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.621
I stick with the majority on this.
Check you all later.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.665
Peace.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.252
Rita Louise Watson?

27:51.379 --> 27:53.339
Get your behind in this house now.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.716
You got homework to do.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.010
Ma, we're just chillin'.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.721
Don't make me come after you.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.766
Listen, call me tonight
so we can figure out a plan.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.184
Rita!

28:05.351 --> 28:08.896
On second thought,
call me in the morning.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.232
See you later, Rita.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.946
Here she comes.

28:41.429 --> 28:44.098
Well, you look like my class.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.517
Is something going on?

28:46.684 --> 28:49.437
No, Sister Mary Clarence.

28:49.603 --> 28:52.857
I saw a scene like this once
in a horror movie.

28:53.023 --> 28:57.653
They subdued an entire community
by putting a drug in the water.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.488
Is that what's going on?

29:01.449 --> 29:03.117
All right.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.912
Today, I'd like to talk about music
cos that's what I am.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.541
I am the music teacher
and it's what I love.

29:10.708 --> 29:14.253
When you think about various people
and what they like -

29:15.171 --> 29:17.506
you think this one
likes this or that -

29:17.673 --> 29:19.592
me, I'm what you call eclectic.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.093
Eclectic?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.303
What's that?

29:22.470 --> 29:26.182
You plug your box into the wall,
it gives you power, stupid!

29:26.348 --> 29:28.601
Not electric. Eclectic, stupid!

29:28.768 --> 29:32.646
Let me simplify it for you.
When I say eclectic,

29:32.813 --> 29:36.066
I mean
I like different types of music.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.487
Opera, rock'n'roll, rap...
I like it all.

29:39.653 --> 29:43.449
But my absolute all-time favourite

29:43.616 --> 29:46.035
are the girl groups
from the '50s and '60s.

29:47.036 --> 29:50.122
Like who?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.793
Tyler, shut up!

29:53.959 --> 29:58.047
Let us not badger this man
who wants this information.

29:59.381 --> 30:03.761
I like Patti LaBelle and the
Bluebelles and I like the Supremes.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.680
Who are the Supremes?

30:08.891 --> 30:10.559
Don't get physical with him.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.312
You're gonna get jumped

30:13.479 --> 30:17.274
A shocking question.
"Who are the Supremes"!

30:17.441 --> 30:19.652
You never heard of Diana Ross?

30:19.819 --> 30:23.072
- Oh, Diana Ross!
- Let me tell you.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.367
They were the premier group.

30:26.534 --> 30:30.913
Your comrades say "yes"
because they were incredible.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.542
What I love,
when I think about music,

30:34.708 --> 30:39.421
is how different types of music
can be fused together.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.382
Fusion.

30:42.466 --> 30:47.555
Yeah, fusion.
I'm really glad you're into this.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.390
The best example I can give...

30:56.105 --> 30:57.815
You got busted!

31:03.445 --> 31:05.531
Fusion! Fusion!

31:16.375 --> 31:18.460
Goddammit!

31:23.799 --> 31:25.885
Oh, man!

31:29.889 --> 31:31.974
Yeah.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.899
We want you to know
that we understand.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.943
You're quite free to leave
whenever you please.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.322
You'd be better off
in show business.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.241
Goodness knows the money is better.

31:49.408 --> 31:53.787
Bright lights and sequins
are prettier than anything here.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.333
Know what I hate most
about this place?

31:57.499 --> 32:00.544
There's nothing to pick up and throw.

32:00.711 --> 32:03.464
We understand.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.674
Yeah.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.428
Would you like a cup of tea?

32:19.772 --> 32:23.317
It would be criminal
if this happened.

32:23.484 --> 32:28.948
St Francis has been a beacon of hope
to people here for many years.

32:29.114 --> 32:33.410
To close the school like that
would be a disaster.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.621
You're sure there's
nothing to be done?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.706
We're afraid not.

32:37.873 --> 32:41.210
I hoped we could keep it open
until the end of the school year.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.921
- We know it's unfortunate.
- We don't like it either.

32:44.088 --> 32:48.968
The archdiocese says St Francis must
close at the end of the semester.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.595
- Why so quickly?
- You're in the red.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.014
There's little hope of recovery.

32:54.181 --> 32:59.103
You must realise that community
contributions have been nil.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.981
The school has no
outstanding academic records.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.651
I've been exploring
other uses for the property.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.778
- Parking?
- Yes.

33:07.945 --> 33:11.365
It's more valuable as a parking lot
than a school. I'm sorry.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.409
The recommendation is to close.

33:13.575 --> 33:17.121
Well, there's nothing more
to be said.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.053
You should be commended

33:33.220 --> 33:35.472
for your excellent analysis
of the situation.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.558
Thank you very much.

33:37.725 --> 33:43.063
But I do wish you'd consider
my application for early retirement.

33:43.230 --> 33:48.610
I've worked for the archdiocese for
almost 30 years. I'd like my due.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.613
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.701
Let's go out
and have some lunch now, shall we?

34:05.502 --> 34:07.546
- What?
- When?

34:07.713 --> 34:10.382
- The end of the semester.
- Where did you hear that?

34:10.549 --> 34:14.344
I happened to be eavesdropping
in Father Maurice's office.

34:14.511 --> 34:19.266
We were afraid this might happen.
I've been expecting it for some time.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.811
- Well, what do we do?
- We'll probably be reassigned.

34:22.978 --> 34:27.483
The children will be bussed to
another school in another district.

34:27.649 --> 34:32.071
That's stupid. This is the only
school in this community.

34:32.237 --> 34:36.574
We've gotta do something,
or we'll lose our students.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.870
Then I guess
we are going to do something.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.746
You do mean we? We?

34:41.914 --> 34:44.416
Yes, yes - we.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.293
You're not leaving?

34:46.460 --> 34:49.254
I said I was gonna come and help.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.590
Thank you, Deloris.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.092
Just call me Mary Clarence.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.639
- Reverend Mother.
- Father Maurice.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.724
I'd like to speak to you.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.353
My mind is consumed
with trying to deal with...

35:04.520 --> 35:06.438
Sister Mary Clarence?

35:06.605 --> 35:10.442
- Yes, as a matter of fact.
- I'm familiar with the dilemma.

35:10.609 --> 35:16.365
She presided over the ecclesiastical
equivalent of a pep rally last night.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.283
I am aware of this.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.827
How did you know?

35:19.993 --> 35:22.621
When one deals with
Sister Mary Clarence,

35:22.788 --> 35:26.875
one is smothered with more
information than one wishes.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.836
She's become quite disruptive.

35:29.002 --> 35:33.298
Disruption is the way
Mary Clarence communicates.

35:33.465 --> 35:37.177
I worry about raising false hopes
among the children.

35:37.344 --> 35:41.765
Tell me about your experiences
with Mary Clarence.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.726
I wouldn't want to frighten you.

35:44.893 --> 35:48.021
In my experience it's easier,

35:48.188 --> 35:54.987
and ultimately quite effective,
to give Mary Clarence a free hand.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.739
Aren't her ideas extremely radical?

35:57.906 --> 36:03.871
If I'm correct, the term "radical"
was applied to us in our day.

36:04.037 --> 36:07.791
Have you forgotten the trouble
we caused Bishop O'Malley?

36:07.958 --> 36:10.210
Oh, yes. Bishop O'Malley.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.298
Give Mary Clarence a chance.

36:16.175 --> 36:19.094
If the school is
on the road to closure,

36:19.261 --> 36:22.181
at least she'll make it
an interesting ride.

36:25.350 --> 36:30.063
Good morning. Please take
your seats quickly and quietly.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.317
Welcome to the first day
of your new scholastic lives.

36:33.483 --> 36:36.278
This is no longer a bird course.

36:36.445 --> 36:41.116
The bird has flown. If you want to
pass, you have to earn it.

36:41.283 --> 36:44.661
I have no problems failing
each and every one of you.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.830
I never thought
this was a bird course.

36:46.997 --> 36:49.833
I'm glad for you. Very, very glad.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.921
This is a new day. Things are gonna
be a little different around here.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.632
Oh, yeah? Like how?

36:56.798 --> 37:00.177
Like when I talk, Frankay, you don't.

37:00.344 --> 37:03.805
Is this something
you wanna share with the class?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.599
No. I'm kicking it with my girl.

37:05.766 --> 37:11.104
You kick it with me or I'll kick
you out. What do you think of that?

37:11.271 --> 37:13.857
Put 'em away.

37:14.024 --> 37:17.736
You! This is not
Elizabeth Arden, Miss Thing.

37:17.903 --> 37:22.658
You wanna beat your mug, do it
at home before you come to class.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.243
Put it away.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.580
Sketch, don't be catching Zs
in my class.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.749
I be tired. I got a job.

37:30.916 --> 37:36.380
Save it for Oprah. This is a
brand-new day, ladies and gentlemen.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.674
We'll start with respect.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.886
You're gonna respect me
and I'm gonna respect you.

37:43.053 --> 37:48.183
The first thing you're gonna do,
gentlemen, is take off those hats.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.645
This is a brand-new day.

37:54.481 --> 37:58.568
I guess that means you'll comb your
hair before you come to class.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.613
You're laughing over there.
You think this is very funny.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.324
There is no sun in this room.
You will not get a tan.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.536
Take off those sunglasses. You too.

38:07.703 --> 38:11.373
If they're not prescription, I don't
want to see 'em. I want to see you.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.460
I want to look into your eyes.
I want you to look into mine.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.921
Yes, Miss Watson?

38:18.088 --> 38:22.301
We don't want no new way.
The old way was fine for us. Right?

38:22.467 --> 38:24.177
Right.

38:24.344 --> 38:29.057
If you're gonna fail us, go ahead.
Cos... I ain't doing nothin'.

38:29.224 --> 38:34.271
Fine. There's the door. Don't let it
hit you in the butts on the way out.

38:34.438 --> 38:37.566
Yo, sis.
I can't afford to fail this class.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.985
Tell your friends that.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.903
My parents wouldn't be pleased.

38:42.279 --> 38:45.407
We ain't gotta take this from her.
Come on.

38:46.033 --> 38:47.993
Sketch, come on, man!

38:50.454 --> 38:52.205
Frankay?

38:52.372 --> 38:57.127
I'm usually down for this,
but I'm gonna take care of business.

38:59.046 --> 39:03.008
A little lonely out on that limb
by yourself, Miss Watson?

39:09.473 --> 39:11.558
So much for friendship.

39:24.029 --> 39:28.575
Let's get down to business.
You wanna go somewhere, be somebody,

39:28.742 --> 39:31.995
you better wake up
and pay attention.

39:32.162 --> 39:36.583
The real world doesn't care
how hip you think you are

39:36.750 --> 39:39.628
or who you kick it with.
It don't matter.

39:39.795 --> 39:42.672
If you don't have an education,
you don't have anything.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.007
That's the truth.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.982
But we cannot do it by ourselves.
We need help.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.820
We're here for the children.
If not for them, for who?

40:04.986 --> 40:06.738
Look.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.324
Let's start with the curriculum.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.701
Let's talk about boring!

40:11.868 --> 40:13.870
I can barely stay awake.

40:14.037 --> 40:19.960
I can goose up sex ed. What do we do
about the graffiti? It's awful!

40:20.127 --> 40:21.753
I'd love to teach new math.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.296
Yes!

40:23.463 --> 40:25.882
Face facts. We're closing down.

40:26.049 --> 40:30.971
Yes, we may be closing,
but we're not closed yet.

40:31.138 --> 40:34.599
So why don't we go out
with a little class?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.184
Let's hear it again.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.689
If you wanna be somebody,
if you wanna go somewhere,

40:40.856 --> 40:43.150
you better wake up
and pay attention.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.235
Make me believe what you're saying.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.862
Can we waken this up a little?

40:47.028 --> 40:50.824
- Yeah, if you think you can.
- OK.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.430
Wait a minute!

41:13.597 --> 41:17.851
Talk about a wake-up call!
Where did this come from?

41:18.018 --> 41:19.769
This is a music class, isn't it?

41:19.936 --> 41:24.483
Yes, it is. Are you telling me
you guys can sing?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.361
That was great!

41:28.528 --> 41:34.367
I've just figured out how I'm gonna
get you through this music class.

41:34.534 --> 41:35.702
Really?

41:35.869 --> 41:40.040
Yes. I'm gonna turn you guys
into a choir.

41:44.169 --> 41:49.591
<i>Most choirs just sing
wack songs nobody cares about.</i>

41:49.758 --> 41:52.302
<i>Maybe not.</i>

41:52.594 --> 41:54.971
Sit down. Let's go.

41:55.138 --> 41:58.725
Quit chewing that gum.
You look like Mr Ed.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.442
Come right in. Watch your footing.

42:24.626 --> 42:27.254
You ready, Alma? Hello?

42:30.131 --> 42:32.300
You ready, Alma?

42:32.467 --> 42:35.887
Alma, turn the pack on.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.891
You ready?

42:40.058 --> 42:42.102
Yes.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.772
- Ready, ladies?
- Yes!

42:47.941 --> 42:51.069
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.784
Play it, Alma! Go ahead, girl!

44:33.129 --> 44:34.464
That was brilliant.

44:34.631 --> 44:37.050
So, what did you guys think?

44:37.217 --> 44:40.178
- Well, it was OK.
- What do you mean, OK?

44:40.345 --> 44:41.429
What about you?

44:41.596 --> 44:44.307
It was cool for what it was,
but it wasn't all that.

44:44.474 --> 44:45.558
Look who was singing.

44:45.725 --> 44:49.145
A bunch of nuns
singing to old biddies?

44:49.312 --> 44:51.523
Two guys in row four
didn't even applaud.

44:51.690 --> 44:53.692
They was deaf, stupid.

44:53.858 --> 44:59.322
We should 86 this choir thing.
Some of us got reps to think about.

44:59.489 --> 45:05.370
If we wear robes and sing hymns,
my homeboys will think we're punks.

45:05.537 --> 45:11.167
In Nigeria, singers wear ceremonial
robes as a mark of honour.

45:11.334 --> 45:12.794
<i>Spare us Roots.</i>

45:12.961 --> 45:16.089
Can't we sing something that won't
get the crap kicked out of us?

45:16.256 --> 45:20.719
I understand you gotta think about
your image. Image is important.

45:20.885 --> 45:24.514
Your friends will dictate
your actions through your life.

45:24.681 --> 45:30.478
So I wouldn't want you to be an
individual - that would be too much.

45:30.645 --> 45:35.233
But I will say this - when these
ladies get on the bus,

45:35.400 --> 45:37.736
do not disrespect them.

45:37.902 --> 45:43.074
It ain't easy to get up and sing
in front of people like yourselves.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.119
Nice job, ladies.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.205
Brilliant.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.100
I smell trouble. Check it out.

46:10.101 --> 46:11.728
What's happening?

46:11.895 --> 46:15.440
What's happening is, I've been sent
to give you a message

46:15.607 --> 46:19.736
like I'm working for Western Union
instead of the church.

46:19.903 --> 46:21.988
Don't say you have to sing it.

46:22.155 --> 46:28.119
Very funny! You won't be as humorous
after you've seen to Father Maurice,

46:28.286 --> 46:30.622
who wants to see you right now.

46:30.789 --> 46:35.376
During school hours we are
responsible for the children.

46:35.543 --> 46:38.087
They can't go on a trip
without parental consent.

46:38.254 --> 46:43.968
OK, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It will never happen again.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.054
Indeed it won't.

46:46.221 --> 46:50.850
From now, authorised
or unauthorised trips are cancelled.

46:51.017 --> 46:53.269
Well, Why?!

46:53.436 --> 46:57.899
In a very short time,
St Francis will close for good.

46:58.066 --> 47:00.860
I'd like that time
to be safe and pleasant

47:01.027 --> 47:04.697
for everyone concerned.
Do I make myself clear?

47:04.864 --> 47:08.159
Yes... abundantly.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.911
Thank you.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.749
You heard him say that?

47:15.041 --> 47:17.043
Just a second ago.

47:17.210 --> 47:20.255
St Francis can't be closed. My family
dropped out of high school.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.590
I refuse to go out like that.

47:22.757 --> 47:27.887
We could take 'em higher
with the choir. It could be dope.

47:28.054 --> 47:30.598
We need to exhibit
some pride in ourselves.

47:30.765 --> 47:34.352
Like Paul Laurence Dunbar did.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.438
OK! That's what I'm talking about.

47:37.605 --> 47:42.318
That's what's wrong with kids today.
Y'all don't wanna listen.

47:42.485 --> 47:44.404
Go ahead and walk away.

47:44.571 --> 47:47.949
Don't y'all realise
what they took from us?

47:48.116 --> 47:50.743
You know what I'm talking about.

47:50.910 --> 47:54.330
They stole our land
and our name and our mother.

47:54.497 --> 47:57.417
- You know what I'm saying, right?
- Get your butt a job.

47:57.584 --> 48:02.463
Brother try to walk the walk
and can't understand the talk.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.757
I know y'all understand me.

48:06.885 --> 48:09.137
This used to be the old music room.

48:09.304 --> 48:12.807
The acoustics are incredible.
You can't buy them.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.939
Looks like <i>Tales From The Crypt.</i>

48:20.106 --> 48:22.317
This is wack.

48:23.610 --> 48:28.448
I'd hate those spiders to get into
the weaves some of you are wearing.

48:35.288 --> 48:37.540
Now, does anybody play an instrument?

48:37.916 --> 48:39.626
I can play. Piano.

48:39.792 --> 48:41.836
Come here.

48:44.714 --> 48:48.009
It still has some sound in it.
Give me an A. See if it works.

48:50.970 --> 48:53.014
Very nice.

48:53.765 --> 48:54.974
OK, let's see.

48:55.516 --> 48:58.394
Sketch. "Mary Had A Little Lamb".

49:00.104 --> 49:01.856
I don't sing. I rap.

49:02.023 --> 49:05.652
I rap too. But you wouldn't know
anything about that.

49:05.818 --> 49:12.533
Excuse me, Frankay, hey ho.
I happen to be a big fan of Run DNA.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.661
Run DMC, my sister.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.664
He got it. It was a joke! Lighten up.

49:17.830 --> 49:21.626
I like Big Daddy Kane.
Will you rap for me, please?

49:21.793 --> 49:24.504
You wanna hear
"Mary Had A Little Lamb"?

49:27.465 --> 49:28.883
Fleece!

49:35.723 --> 49:37.433
Not bad.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.435
Ahmal, sing for me.

49:48.695 --> 49:52.031
A little tentative,
but we can work on that. Very nice.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.909
Shaka Zulu
said word sounds had powers.

49:55.076 --> 49:58.579
Chaka Khan said "it's my thing."
So what?

49:58.746 --> 50:00.957
Tanya - "Mary Had A Little Lamb".

50:06.713 --> 50:08.673
That was beautiful.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.261
Go ahead. You just saved that
lamb's life. No lamb chops tonight.

50:13.428 --> 50:15.346
Very nice.

50:15.513 --> 50:19.517
What do you say we try it,
just for fun, as a group?

50:19.684 --> 50:21.728
You up for that?

50:23.104 --> 50:25.189
On three. Give me an A.

50:26.065 --> 50:28.943
He's so multi-talented, isn't he?

50:29.110 --> 50:32.030
That's very nice,
the way you did that.

50:32.196 --> 50:35.158
All right, on three. One, two, three.

50:39.579 --> 50:43.624
OK, OK, OK. Maybe I went
a little too fast for you.

50:43.791 --> 50:46.961
We'll go back
and take it nice and slow.

50:47.128 --> 50:50.506
Maria, let me hear
"Mary Had A Little Lamb".

50:52.300 --> 50:53.885
What's the matter?

50:54.052 --> 50:55.553
Come on, Maria.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.097
- She's shy.
- What?

50:58.264 --> 51:01.934
I don't know
"Mary Had A Little Lamb".

51:06.647 --> 51:09.150
Excuse me!

51:09.317 --> 51:15.114
It is not Maria's fault if she
does not know that Mary had a lamb.

51:15.281 --> 51:20.369
It is not - and I say this to you -
it is not Maria's fault,

51:20.536 --> 51:25.583
because maybe where
Maria came from, Mary had a dog.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.668
Or a little kitty cat.

51:27.835 --> 51:31.506
Or a little bald-headed brother
named Bart.

51:31.672 --> 51:34.509
It is not her fault
that she doesn't know it.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.762
We're not going to
hold it against her, are we?

51:37.929 --> 51:42.850
You sing whatever it is
that is in you to sing. All right.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.061
Thank you.

51:56.322 --> 52:02.620
OK, stop. "The Love Boat" - all
right. That's nice. Mary Lazarus,

52:02.787 --> 52:03.913
this is your soul mate.

52:04.080 --> 52:08.251
Do you know the theme song from
"Gilligan's island"? My favourite.

52:08.417 --> 52:12.088
This isn't about
whether you can sing or not.

52:12.255 --> 52:15.174
We know you can.
We've heard you do it.

52:15.341 --> 52:19.512
This is about singing together

52:19.679 --> 52:21.722
as a group. Hit it.

52:22.974 --> 52:26.853
All right. On three. One, two...

53:08.352 --> 53:10.438
I mess up that part every time!

53:19.071 --> 53:21.115
What's the matter, Rita?

53:21.282 --> 53:22.617
That was beautiful.

53:22.783 --> 53:25.411
Don't even try. You can blow too.

53:25.578 --> 53:28.998
But you got the type of voice.
You could really make it.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.793
This is for church.

53:34.921 --> 53:37.673
What's wrong with you, girl?

53:37.840 --> 53:40.885
I've just been thinking about things.

53:41.052 --> 53:44.263
My mother thinks
singing is dead-end.

53:44.430 --> 53:46.974
- No security.
- And that's cool, Rita.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.018
But what do you think?

53:52.313 --> 53:54.273
I don't know.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.859
Let's do the song I was doing.

53:57.026 --> 53:59.028
But this time let's do it together.

53:59.195 --> 54:03.574
- I can't sing with you.
- Come on! I know you with it.

54:06.577 --> 54:10.206
You take the top
and I'll take the bottom.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.668
Just try it.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.414
Please don't stop.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.708
I'll see you later, Rita.

54:56.961 --> 54:59.338
You have a beautiful voice.

55:01.841 --> 55:03.926
So what?

55:05.761 --> 55:07.638
So...

55:09.015 --> 55:11.475
So why aren't you in the choir?

55:11.642 --> 55:13.561
I know you wanna be.

55:13.728 --> 55:18.024
There's a lot of things I wanna do,
but I ain't gonna get to do 'em.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.400
Yeah, I know.

55:19.567 --> 55:21.736
I used to feel that way too.

55:23.988 --> 55:27.074
You should talk to Sister Mary
Clarence. She helped me so...

55:29.869 --> 55:33.122
You're just barely 17.

55:33.289 --> 55:37.835
How do you know what
you're gonna get to do and not do?

55:38.002 --> 55:41.672
Have you walked
around this neighbourhood?

55:41.839 --> 55:44.592
Not exactly the land of opportunity.

55:44.759 --> 55:49.805
I might wanna sing, but it ain't
gonna happen, so what's the point?

55:49.972 --> 55:52.641
Welcome to the real world, sister.

55:58.230 --> 56:00.316
What's the matter?

56:00.775 --> 56:03.444
This chick's got a lotta attitude.

56:03.611 --> 56:07.281
No, I think it's deeper than that.

56:07.448 --> 56:09.867
Deloris... Sister Mary Clarence.

56:10.034 --> 56:12.620
I think that she needs help.

56:12.787 --> 56:14.872
Why are you looking at me?

56:15.039 --> 56:19.668
I thought you could help her,
kind of the way you helped me.

56:19.835 --> 56:23.422
No, no. You were different.

56:23.589 --> 56:26.801
She really, really wants to sing.

56:27.676 --> 56:29.762
Is she any good?

56:31.222 --> 56:33.307
Yes!

56:37.853 --> 56:43.317
- God bless you, Sister Clarence.
- Chapel time. Get in there.

56:51.033 --> 56:52.993
What?!

56:53.160 --> 56:57.039
You have a little bit more attitude
than I like,

56:57.206 --> 57:01.085
but I've decided to dog you,
no matter what. OK?

57:01.252 --> 57:02.795
I'm listening to you.

57:02.962 --> 57:05.047
I know you want to sing.

57:05.214 --> 57:08.050
I love to sing.
Nothing makes me happier.

57:08.217 --> 57:11.220
I either wanted to be a singer
or the head of the Ice Capades.

57:11.387 --> 57:15.558
You know the Ice Capades?
Don't roll your eyes! They were cool.

57:15.724 --> 57:17.977
My mother gave me this book.

57:18.144 --> 57:22.481
<i>Letters To A Young Poet
by Rainer Maria Rilke.</i>

57:22.648 --> 57:26.569
A fabulous writer.
A fella wrote to him saying

57:26.735 --> 57:29.905
"I wanna be a writer. Read my stuff."

57:30.072 --> 57:34.076
Rilke says "Don't ask me
about being a writer."

57:34.243 --> 57:39.832
"if you can think of nothing
but writing, then you're a writer."

57:39.999 --> 57:42.835
I'm gonna say the same thing to you.

57:43.002 --> 57:47.798
If you wake up and you can't think
of anything but singing,

57:47.965 --> 57:50.426
then you're supposed to be
a singer.

57:53.137 --> 57:56.432
What's the point of your story,
sister?

57:56.599 --> 57:58.642
Read the book.

58:02.897 --> 58:06.025
And don't roll your eyes
about the Ice Capades.

58:06.192 --> 58:10.404
It was a good living.
I just want to point that out.

58:35.846 --> 58:37.848
That's good.

58:40.684 --> 58:43.062
Let's try some energy, hey!

58:44.480 --> 58:46.565
And as a group.

58:49.235 --> 58:51.320
From the diaphragm.

58:52.947 --> 58:55.032
Welcome back!

58:57.159 --> 58:59.245
Let's do Frankay!

59:14.969 --> 59:17.888
We're going right down the scale.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.977
Yes, go on, go on.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.980
OK, got it? This is so funny.

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:23.662
Do you think Shaka Zulu
could repel a bunch of troops

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.790
with the tiny voice you're using?

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.084
Give me "O Happy Day" in C.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:34.715
You listen to what I'm gonna do, OK?

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:36.967
This is you.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:41.764
That ain't gonna scare nobody.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.934
That's what I want you to do.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:48.437
Take it up half a step for me.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.774
All right, repel me.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.782
That ain't gonna scare nobody.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.619
Now you got it.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.395
OK, you guys, relax.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.689
Take a deep breath.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:35.401
Be fine. Don't worry.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.404
You ready?

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.161
Come here. Stand over here.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:04.096
You have to do better than this.

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:10.728
Take your cue from me.

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.863
You.

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:27.619
Sing.

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:58.317
Let's party-

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:22.860
Take your bow.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.697
Go on. Take your bow.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.740
All right!

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.419
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:43.755
I believe we are now a choir.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.015
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.059
Show me the man
that a woman can trust.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:59.855
Where does it say
on the eighth day he dusted?

01:05:00.022 --> 01:05:08.071
Look at these trophies. All-State
Music Competition, 1971, 1969.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.241
This school's been winning
competitions for a long time.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.869
Think they still have these contests?

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.961
Focus.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:27.090
What if I told you
that we have entered you all

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.468
in the All-State
Music Competition?

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:32.346
Six weeks from Saturday in Hollywood!

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.765
What?!

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:37.935
- They be doing some crazy stuff!
- That is so cool!

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:42.856
You put this choir together.
We took our cue from you.

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:48.612
This school's won competitions.
Don't you have faith in yourselves?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:53.033
Are we good enough
to compete against other choirs?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.205
You could be if you rehearse before
class and after school. How about it?

01:05:58.372 --> 01:05:59.998
Wait, sisters.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:04.127
We need to discuss this.
Y'all ready for an All-State thing?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.213
No! Absolutely not.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.299
Come on, y'all!

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:13.637
Nobody has ever cared
what we was good at,

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:17.057
except Sister Mary Clarence
and her homegirls.

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:23.063
They were hooking us up. Plus,
we can go to Hollywood. Hollywood!

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.648
What are we gonna wear?

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.191
Airhead!

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:27.401
Clothes!

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:31.905
Guys, come on. We owe this
to ourselves. We should do it.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:34.533
What about our boyfriends?

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.953
There may be some all-boy choirs
at this competition.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.454
We're in.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.708
If we win the archdiocese
is going to be pleased as punch.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.502
Maybe we'll have a prayer
to keep this school open.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.713
Right.

01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:53.051
Does this mean we're going
to the All-State Competition?

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.262
Yes!

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:03.729
Let's turn this mother out
and rock the house! Dope!

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:07.441
They wouldn't bring drugs in here,
would they?

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:08.900
No.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.777
No! Absolutely not!

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.071
How can you keep saying no?

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:16.450
They're good.
They are so ready for this.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:21.038
You made a promise to the students
that you can't keep.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.540
Field trips are out of the question.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.752
This is not a field trip.
It could save the school.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.212
- You have my answer.
- It's the wrong one!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:33.592
Sister Mary Clarence!
You're being insubordinate!

01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:38.096
I know. And surely
you can understand why.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:42.976
The kids have worked hard for this.
They're really good.

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:48.899
They could win. This school used
to win that competition every year.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:54.112
If they're gonna close this school,
let's go outwith a bang!

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:56.114
Yes, let her!

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:59.159
Very awesome.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:05.791
Well... Very well, then. You seem
to have the support of everyone.

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:08.251
So I'll give my permission.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:16.885
You've got to raise the money
and get parental consent.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:19.679
That is not a problem. Thank you.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.473
Thank you, my brothers.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.683
Come on.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.700
Again.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.319
<i>Everything</i>

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.531
<i>Joyful, joyful</i>

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.831
<i>Fill us with the light of day</i>

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.881
Rita?

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.050
<i>Come and join the chorus</i>

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.678
<i>Mighty, mighty chorus</i>

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.479
Mama!
What are you doing home so early?

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:56.943
Mrs Gibbs needs me to do her hair.
What are you doing?

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.945
Just fooling with some stuff.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.323
Give me that, please.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.533
Give me that.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.536
And the tape recorder too.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:11.124
What is this?

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.169
It's just some music, ma.

01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:18.965
Sister Mary Clarence wants us
to learn it. For the choir.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:23.053
When were you gonna tell me
that you're in a choir?

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:27.974
Rita, how many times
do we have to go through this?

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.311
Singing does not put food
on the table.

01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:34.147
Singing does not pay the bills.

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:38.735
Singing is no guarantee to a future,
even if you have talent.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.528
Did you know I can sing?

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.323
Your daddy died trying to make it.

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:47.285
What does that have to do with me?
We're a good choir.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:51.414
We could win
the All-State Music Competition.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:55.502
Keep your nose in them books
and out of the clouds.

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:57.254
If you'd listen to me...

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.717
I know how you feel. But there are a
lot of talented people on the street

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.553
singing shoulda coulda wouldas.
Is that how you wanna end up?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.932
- You know I don't.
- Good, cos you've got to study.

01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:10.684
We have a chance.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:13.561
The choir and competition are out.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:14.729
But, mama...

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:17.774
If you "But, mama" me
one more time...

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:23.071
Now, the choir and the competition
is out. You understand?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.701
Yes, ma'am.

01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:56.730
With food, lodging, costumes,
transport and gas,

01:11:56.896 --> 01:12:00.984
this'll cost about $2,000.
Which is a lot of money.

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:04.362
Don't look at me.
I took a vow of poverty.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:09.075
The only person that
made money as a nun - Sally Field.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:12.078
$2,000?!
It might as well be a million.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.372
It's absolutely doable.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:19.878
The community should be involved -
time they took care of the school.

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:22.088
It's the only way.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:25.050
Rita, I'm glad you're here.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:28.762
Make sure
your mom signs this consent form.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.681
If we can raise the buckaroos.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:36.728
I have to quit the choir for
reasons I can't explain. I'm sorry.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:39.105
But I gotta leave the choir.

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.191
Give us back our consent form.

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.401
Stop that!

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.956
Just a minute, please.

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:05.465
Hi! I'm Sister Mary Clarence.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:09.135
I know who you are.
What can I do for you?

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.389
Well, Rita left the choir.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:17.060
I was kinda hoping
you could talk her into coming back.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:19.479
I don't think I can do that.

01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:21.815
Know something, sister?

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:26.444
I don't want to discuss this.
I've got work to do.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:30.323
If you'll excuse me...
Good day to you.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:46.506
We're here to collect
some money from you.

01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:51.302
That means we need your help.
Put that basket out there.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:54.722
Give that money.
Give that money, baby.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:58.685
Give that money.
Come on, girls, do what I do.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.293
Sing it if you know it.

01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:24.354
Oh, my!

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:27.690
Are you OK?

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:28.900
All right.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:40.995
I'm going.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.470
I'm going!

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:11.401
And the grand total is, minus
expenses - drum roll, please...

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:14.237
$1,920.17.

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:17.490
Wow! That oughta get us
down there and back.

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:20.451
You're not driving again, are you?

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:23.496
I can drive anything on wheels.
You have a problem with that?

01:16:23.663 --> 01:16:24.706
Uh-uh.

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.541
It's been a long day.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:29.335
We've got a lot to do in a few days.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:33.923
Don't forget to get
the consent forms from the kids.

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.890
All right.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:47.061
- What?
- Nothing. No, it's something.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:51.482
I just can't believe
you came here and did it again.

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.651
You made all this happen.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.196
Everything's gonna be fine now.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.950
You think so?

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:04.329
I really think so.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.208
Thanks. You want some help?

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:12.670
Please.
Look - we have another helper.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:17.717
I don't know about you sometimes.
You're scary.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.228
Yo, Rita!

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.065
Come here!

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.651
What's up, Rita?

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:39.155
Mary Clarence
said you quit the choir.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.240
Yeah, I did. So?

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:44.827
So enquiring minds want to know.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:48.039
If I wanna quit the choir,
it's my business.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.750
It's like the choir's a big joke.

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:55.880
I'm sure we'll have a plethora
of other opportunities!

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.344
Rita, look, we got a real shot.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:07.475
If we're gonna do anything worth
something, we gotta stick together.

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:12.522
Don't you understand?
This is all we got.

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:18.903
This is all right here.
You have to be down. I want you to.

01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:02.238
What a mess!

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:03.406
Is that everybody?

01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:05.199
Wait for me!

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.249
Thank you, Sister.

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:15.168
Nice to see you.

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:19.422
Excuse me. Consent form.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:22.717
A must. Thank you.

01:19:22.884 --> 01:19:24.927
Come on, come on.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.896
Look what I found in the library.

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:39.442
Deloris Van Cartier.
A lounge singer?!

01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:42.653
I knew I'd seen her
somewhere before.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:48.117
"Girlfriend of a vicious mobster."
Oh, dear! A gun moll!

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:53.414
Sister Mary Christine... Clift-...
Sister Mary Fake!

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:57.376
I'll have to call the officials
and remove us from the competition.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:01.297
No, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.090
What would you suggest?

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:08.721
She's our responsibility.
We should handle it... personally.

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:17.188
You don't usually drive. Perhaps
one of us with a driver's license...

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:19.774
Nonsense!

01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:26.072
Thomas, I know you're busy,
but see that stick on the left?

01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.574
That's your turning signal.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:33.454
The other drivers wouldn't be so
hostile if you'd use it.

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:35.540
I've had enough of this.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:40.336
Where in the Sam Hill
did you people learn how to drive?

01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:45.716
Jackass!

01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:48.719
Thomas! Jesus Christ!

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.431
Rita? I'm home.

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:18.291
"Dear mama - I went to
the All-State Music Competition."

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:24.881
"I never meant to hurt you,
but I had to follow my heart."

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:28.342
"Please forgive me.
I love you. Rita."

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.473
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.436
<i>to the 30th
All-State Music Competition.</i>

01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:44.650
<i>A gathering of the most talented
young musicians in California.</i>

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.906
Let's go, Margaret.
It is Margaret, isn't it?

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:52.408
I can't tell under all that paint.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:56.579
I hate this thing.
It does nothing for my figure.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:58.664
Can't I wear something tighter?

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:03.711
You're here to impress the judges
with your voice, not your heinie.

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:09.050
<i>He sent his men unto her grave</i>

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:14.388
<i>To tell where she was buried</i>

01:22:14.555 --> 01:22:16.933
<i>And all she said...</i>

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.853
- Look what you did!
- I'm sorry.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.482
Put one on the other side.
Start a fashion trend.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:28.736
Mangbatu women paint their cheeks
as signs of fertility.

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:31.572
On second thought, take it off.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.909
- Dang, man!
- What?

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:37.286
This thing ripped!
What am I supposed to do?

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.498
Don't fret. My mother used to say,

01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:46.462
"Nothing is impossible if you have
faith and a roll of electrical tape"

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:49.131
Look at my hair! You like my hair?

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:53.094
It looks like a bowl of lard
and you look wack.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:57.556
I'm so nervous,
I don't think I can go on.

01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:00.351
Never mind how you feel.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:05.272
Think how great you'll make
the audience feel when you sing.

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:08.109
Take a deep breath, and yawn.

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:11.237
See how that relaxes you?

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:18.786
Now, from San Diego, the Oceanview
High School Gospel Choir.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.288
They're good. They're really good.

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.550
We have to go backstage.

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:17.094
But how are we going to find them?

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:20.681
Shouldn't be hard.
We look for the choir

01:24:20.848 --> 01:24:24.143
that looks like
it just robbed a convenience store.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:27.521
Great Caesar's ghost!

01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:28.814
Passes!

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:35.905
Three times state champions,
the Chapman Choir

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:39.492
from Orange County's
Grant High School.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:55.966
<i>Joyful, joyful, we adore thee</i>

01:24:56.133 --> 01:25:00.221
<i>God of glory, Lord of love</i>

01:25:00.387 --> 01:25:04.600
<i>Hearts unfold like flowers before thee</i>

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.603
<i>Opening to the sun above</i>

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.480
They're singing our song!

01:25:09.647 --> 01:25:11.190
They're like an army!

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:15.194
<i>Drive the dark of doubt away</i>

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:18.781
<i>Giver of immortal...</i>

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:21.158
Doughnuts!

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.705
Hello?

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.833
Father Thomas! It's us!

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:30.918
Colour me surprised.

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:36.132
The kids will burst when they find
you've come to support them.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.885
We didn't come
to support the children.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:44.807
Father Maurice and Mr Crisp will pull
them out of the competition.

01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:47.226
Why would they wanna do that?

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:48.936
Because

01:25:49.103 --> 01:25:52.356
Sister Mary Clarence isn't a sister.

01:25:52.523 --> 01:25:54.608
She's a Las Vegas showgirl.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:59.655
Who'd have thunk!
She has so many nun-like qualities.

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.699
Not to mention the outfit.

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:07.204
Yes. Father Maurice and Mr Crisp
are looking for them right now.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:12.168
That's a good idea. I think
we should go look for her too.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.670
Good idea. I agree. Bye-bye.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.881
See you.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:23.262
<i>Ever singing, march we onward</i>

01:26:23.429 --> 01:26:24.471
They got it going.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:28.267
Look at those robes.
We'll look like suckers.

01:26:28.434 --> 01:26:31.145
All of a sudden,
I don't feel good.

01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:38.277
<i>In the triumph song of life</i>

01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:46.702
Very good.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.814
- Why aren't you ready?
- You saw that other choir?

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:19.777
- We can't win against them.
- We'll be laughed off the stage.

01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.654
I didn't come to be embarrassed.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.656
They sang our song, much better!

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.282
We're going home.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:29.954
You're all ready to leave
cos you got scared?

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:38.837
It's your MO. It's how you operate.
"Something new - better run away."

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:43.217
Forget the people who busted
their butt to get you here.

01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:47.179
I'm gonna remind you - if you wanna
go somewhere, be somebody,

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:50.599
you better wake up
and pay attention.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.979
If every time something scary
comes up, you run,

01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:59.149
you'll be runnin'
for the rest of your lives.

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:06.240
You guys, she is right.

01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:08.659
If we do this, we gotta be slammin'.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:22.214
St Francis Academy? Get ready.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:33.642
I'm terribly sorry.
What a sea of humanity. Sorry.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:37.813
Father Maurice!
We thought you wasn't coming.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:42.651
Hello. Yes.

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:45.029
- Glad you're here.
- Thank you.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:47.072
We'll win with you here.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:50.409
I'm glad to be here
to support the choir.

01:28:50.576 --> 01:28:56.081
But something has been brought
to my attention. Something...

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.834
I don't know how to say this.

01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:01.587
But I just have to say that...

01:29:01.754 --> 01:29:04.089
you children are amazing!

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:09.136
I almost didn't recognise you.
There's such a glow in you.

01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:12.556
Remarkable. You all look like angels.

01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:15.225
Wait till you hear 'em sing.

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:17.353
You guys, places. Let's go.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:30.324
Father Maurice, what are you doing?

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:32.785
I decided to let them sing.

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:37.539
- Do you know what you've done?
- What did I do?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:41.126
Didn't you call the archdiocese
people about Sister Mary Fake?

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:42.961
I thought I'd tell them
when I saw them.

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:46.340
- Are they here?
- I think they're here.

01:29:46.507 --> 01:29:48.175
- But you haven't told them?
- Not yet.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:52.971
Well, I'll tell them. I'll make sure
they know. Where are they?

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:56.850
Mr Crisp, we'll help you find them.
Won't we, guys?

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.853
A few minutes ago,
they went that way.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.522
Are you sure?

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:03.690
- I saw too.
- I saw with him.

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:05.901
Let's go!

01:30:06.777 --> 01:30:08.112
We just came down here!

01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:10.823
They went down the hall here.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:15.911
They were saying something
about the ventilation system.

01:30:16.078 --> 01:30:19.164
Have you been drinking
the sacramental wine?

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:20.332
Mr Crisp!

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:23.252
They're in here. I can hear voices.

01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:25.546
Sure you can hear voices!

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:28.340
- There they are. After you.
- What are you talking about?

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:30.843
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute!

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:34.054
Get something
to hold this door with.

01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:36.849
Not this! This is dessert!

01:30:37.015 --> 01:30:39.059
Give me that thing!

01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:43.147
Open the door! It's dark in here!

01:30:43.313 --> 01:30:47.317
Father, forgive us.
We know exactly what we do!

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:59.413
That last choir was rather good.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:05.669
What she's done with the children
is amazing.

01:31:05.836 --> 01:31:09.965
Well, Sister Mary Clarence
is no ordinary nun.

01:31:10.132 --> 01:31:12.551
You don't have to tell me that.

01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:16.263
You're not angry with me
for misleading you?

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:18.307
Not at all.

01:31:18.474 --> 01:31:21.685
You're free to fool me
any time you want.

01:31:22.019 --> 01:31:24.688
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:29.568
from San Francisco,
the choir of St Francis High School,

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:33.113
under the direction of
Sister Mary Clarence,

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.867
also singing "Joyful, Joyful".

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:32.506
<i>Joyful, joyful, Lord, we adore thee</i>

01:32:33.924 --> 01:32:38.428
<i>God of glory, Lord of love</i>

01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:46.937
<i>Hearts unfold like flowers before thee</i>

01:32:47.104 --> 01:32:50.274
Your teacher says
take off your robes.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.069
Do it quickly. I don't know.
Just take them off.

01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:58.031
Put on anything you want. We're gonna
go out there comfortable.

01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:00.242
Some of us.

01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:07.749
<i>Drive the dark of doubt away</i>

01:33:10.377 --> 01:33:18.427
<i>Giver of immortal gladness</i>

01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:22.723
<i>Fill us With the light</i>

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:35.611
<i>Of day</i>

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:50.125
<i>Joyful, joyful, Lord, we adore thee</i>

01:33:50.417 --> 01:33:53.754
<i>God of glory, Lord of love</i>

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:59.092
<i>Hearts unfold like flowers before thee</i>

01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:02.512
<i>Hail thee as the sun above</i>

01:34:03.347 --> 01:34:07.809
<i>Melt the clouds of sin
Sin and sadness</i>

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.313
<i>Drive the dark of doubt away</i>

01:34:11.605 --> 01:34:16.360
<i>Drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness</i>

01:34:16.652 --> 01:34:21.156
<i>Fill us
Fill us with the light of day</i>

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:24.409
<i>Check the rhyme!</i>

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:25.827
<i>Joyful, joyful</i>

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:27.120
<i>Lord, we adore thee</i>

01:34:27.287 --> 01:34:29.081
<i>And in my life
I put none before thee</i>

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:32.918
<i>Since I was young, I came to know
You was the only way to go</i>

01:34:33.085 --> 01:34:35.796
So <i>I have come to an understanding</i>

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:38.006
<i>That I'm down with the King
So now I'm demanding</i>

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:39.966
<i>That you tell me who you're down with</i>

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:41.593
<i>Cos I'm down with G-O-D!</i>

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.096
<i>- You down with G-O-D?
- Yeah, you know me</i>

01:34:48.642 --> 01:34:51.311
<i>- Who's down with G-O-D?
- Everybody!</i>

01:34:51.478 --> 01:34:53.021
<i>Come and join the chorus</i>

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:55.232
<i>The mighty, mighty chorus</i>

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:59.236
<i>Which the morning stars began</i>

01:34:59.528 --> 01:35:03.615
<i>The Father of love is rising over us</i>

01:35:03.782 --> 01:35:04.950
<i>By the Way</i>

01:35:05.117 --> 01:35:07.619
<i>What have you done for him lately?</i>

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:16.461
<i>What have you done for him lately?</i>

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:20.590
<i>He watches over everything</i>

01:35:20.757 --> 01:35:22.926
<i>So we sing</i>

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.886
<i>Joyful, joyful</i>

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:28.515
<i>Lord, we adore thee</i>

01:35:28.682 --> 01:35:31.893
<i>God of glory, Lord of love</i>

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.814
<i>Hearts unfold like flowers before thee</i>

01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:40.068
<i>Hail thee as the sun above</i>

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:44.364
<i>Melt the clouds of sin
Sin and sadness</i>

01:35:44.614 --> 01:35:49.161
<i>Drive the dark of doubt away</i>

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:53.540
<i>Drive it all away
Giver of immortal gladness</i>

01:35:53.707 --> 01:35:55.751
<i>Fill us</i>

01:35:56.168 --> 01:35:57.836
<i>Fill us with the light of day</i>

01:36:00.172 --> 01:36:02.883
<i>Oh, we need you, yes we do</i>

01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:08.930
<i>Fill us</i>

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.975
<i>With the light of day, Lord</i>

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:16.146
<i>Hear us as we pray, Lord</i>

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.913
<i>Fill us with the light of day</i>

01:36:33.914 --> 01:36:36.082
<i>Light of day</i>

01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:05.445
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:10.575
But first, let's give
all the contestants a nice big hand.

01:37:16.915 --> 01:37:18.416
Thank you.

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:21.044
The third runner-up,

01:37:21.211 --> 01:37:25.632
Pinewood High School
San Bernardino Quartet.

01:37:29.219 --> 01:37:32.514
The second runner-up,
Oceanview High School,

01:37:32.681 --> 01:37:35.350
San Diego Gospel Choir.

01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:46.528
First runner-up,

01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:50.740
Grant High School Orange County
Chapman Choir.

01:37:58.957 --> 01:38:01.459
The grand prize winner,

01:38:01.626 --> 01:38:04.296
St Francis High School,

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:06.506
San Francisco!

01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:46.838
Simply outstanding.

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:48.548
What a performance!

01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:50.383
Good evening.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.929
What a surprise to see you. You're
aware that the school that just won

01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:57.015
is the school you are about to close?

01:38:57.182 --> 01:38:59.851
You must be kidding!
With a choir like that?

01:39:00.018 --> 01:39:05.023
- Get ready for next year!
- I'm so pleased you feel that way.

01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:06.232
Mr Crisp!

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:10.403
Just the people I want to see!
You have been deceived.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:13.031
What's he talking about?

01:39:13.198 --> 01:39:17.535
- This Sister Mary Clarence!
- You have been deceived.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:19.454
Actually, it was Mr Crisp...

01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:21.373
It was Mr Crisp's idea?

01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:25.043
He did it to keep St Francis
from closing. And it worked.

01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:26.962
St Francis isn't closing?

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:29.422
No, St Francis isn't closing.

01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:34.219
We knew you wanted early retirement.
We didn't know you were being modest.

01:39:34.386 --> 01:39:36.054
Oh, I...

01:39:36.221 --> 01:39:38.807
They can't put a prize bull like you
out to pasture.

01:39:38.974 --> 01:39:41.685
There must be
a real trouble spot somewhere

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:46.064
that could use Mr Crisp's
extraordinary talents.

01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:49.693
That woman! That woman!

01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:51.945
Go with God, Crispy!

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:58.326
How does Sister Mary Clarence
perform night after night in Vegas?

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:01.371
She's used to all this.
We're the nervous wrecks

01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:03.581
All these people!

01:40:04.416 --> 01:40:06.501
Vegas?!

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:21.766
Mama, it was just this one time.

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:23.977
I'm sorry.
I'll never disobey you again.

01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:26.146
Please don't be mad at me.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:28.231
Just stop.

01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:31.901
You're incredible.

01:40:33.153 --> 01:40:35.238
And I'm proud of you.

01:40:36.865 --> 01:40:38.950
I'm very proud of you.

01:40:47.751 --> 01:40:51.212
Congratulations! All of you!

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:53.965
Sister Mary Clarence,
you've done it again.

01:40:54.132 --> 01:40:57.177
And because of your success,

01:40:57.343 --> 01:41:02.182
the archdiocese have decided
to keep St Francis open!

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:05.393
You owe me.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.479
I feel so happy, I'm gonna cry.

01:41:07.645 --> 01:41:11.232
I'm a sucker
for happy endings myself.

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:14.277
You two! Oh, what the hell!

01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:19.199
You ain't really a nun.

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:22.118
You don't talk like a nun.
And you don't act like one.

01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:25.371
Rumour has it
you're a Las Vegas showgirl.

01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:29.667
Let me point out one thing,
my dear Ahmal.

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:35.090
I am not now, nor have I ever been,
a Las Vegas showgirl.

01:41:37.092 --> 01:41:40.220
I am a headliner.

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.350
Now wait a minute!

01:41:45.517 --> 01:41:48.686
And one, two, one, two.

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:21.738
Just as fast as I can!
