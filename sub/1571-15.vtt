00:38.204 --> 00:39.872
Okay, Brian, here we are.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.507
Hey, thanks for fitting in
the ride to school

00:41.509 --> 00:43.075
in between your texts.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.410
Totally, Chris, totally.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.045
I'm sure it'll all
work itself out.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.546
And good luck on that thing.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.416
You know, that was a stroller,
not a speed bump.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.922
Uh-oh. This looks like trouble.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.691
I'll know they're bullies
if they use my full name.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.026
Well, look who it is.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.194
Chris Griffin.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.195
Oh, boy.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.696
Hey, fat ass.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.098
Your boobs are bigger
than your sister's.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.933
Oh, yeah? Well...

01:07.935 --> 01:10.602
you have a sister as well.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.438
That's your comeback?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.439
(bullies laugh)

01:13.441 --> 01:14.440
Oh, man!

01:14.442 --> 01:16.442
Oh, my God. Poor Chris.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.545
He's a social outcast
like Scarface.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.746
Okay, we have a deal.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.948
You bring the money,
I get you the coke.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.716
You got it, Scarface.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.717
Oh, my God!

01:25.719 --> 01:27.086
You can see that?

01:27.088 --> 01:29.121
The doctor said
you wouldn't be able to!

01:29.123 --> 01:30.589
Yes, everyone can see that.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.124
That's why we call
you Scarface.

01:32.126 --> 01:35.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa! "We"?

01:39.432 --> 01:42.968
Well, I have officially seen
every video ever on YouTube.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.137
Got to say,
there's not a bad one.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.973
I need these shipping invoices
filed immediately.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.976
I'll be right back.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.077
There she goes again.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.078
How come she always skips out

01:53.080 --> 01:54.279
when there's work to do?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.148
She's just taking
a smoke break.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.983
A deaf person smoking.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.418
That's-that's weird.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.086
Why is that weird?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.421
That... I mean, there's
no reason that that's weird,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.289
but it-it-it is weird, right?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.991
Yes, Griffin, it's weird.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.160
Wait, so you mean to tell me,
if I ever want to get out

02:08.162 --> 02:10.095
of something, all I got
to do is take a smoke break?

02:10.097 --> 02:11.096
Well, I suppose.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.764
But you don't smoke.

02:12.766 --> 02:16.668
Well, actually I do.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.472
All right, Griffin.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.806
You're clearly a smoker.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.475
Enjoy your break.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.877
Wow, I can use smoking
to get out of anything.

02:58.879 --> 03:02.214
Finally, I'm above the law
like my 14th century ancestor

03:02.216 --> 03:05.184
King of Denmark Griffin.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.852
More wine! More women!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.453
More table!

03:10.490 --> 03:12.724
(laughing)

03:13.860 --> 03:14.893
(groaning)

03:14.895 --> 03:16.562
I'm having a heart attack!

03:16.564 --> 03:18.530
Is anyone at the table a doctor?

03:18.532 --> 03:19.498
I am!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.833
Come here! Hurry! Run!

03:21.835 --> 03:25.337
"But the very far-away doctor
couldn't make it in time."

03:25.339 --> 03:29.608
And that's why here in Denmark
we have very small tables.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.884
Okay, Stewie, time to
change your diaper.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.187
Ooh! Oh, smoke break!

03:42.189 --> 03:44.223
Well, this is
how Scott Caan was raised,

03:44.225 --> 03:46.425
and he turned out okay.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.763
Hey, Dad, want to hear a story
about my day at school?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.432
It's about my hot
friend Melissa.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.766
Okay.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.235
She didn't wear a
bra to school today.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.869
Okay.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.405
And someone spilled water
all over her white shirt.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.873
Okay.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.875
And it was cold, so you
could see everything.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.544
Okay.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.913
Then she left and I realized
I was all alone...

04:07.915 --> 04:10.782
Smoke break!

04:14.754 --> 04:16.288
Hey, Chris?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.790
I-I wanted to talk about
what happened at school...

04:18.792 --> 04:20.592
Is that a dead gerbil in there?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.793
That's a fur fish.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.295
It's a weird species.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.230
You put them in there,
and they swim like hell

04:25.232 --> 04:27.432
for, like, 30 seconds,
and then they go to sleep.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.301
This joker still
hasn't woken up.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.303
Get up, lazy!

04:31.305 --> 04:32.604
You know, the way those kids

04:32.606 --> 04:34.072
were picking on you
today in school--

04:34.074 --> 04:35.474
you really got to stand
up for yourself.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.442
Stewie, it's not so easy.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.978
What would you say if I said,
"Hey there, shorty"?

04:39.980 --> 04:42.981
I'd say, "Have another
doughnut, you albino gorilla."

04:42.983 --> 04:44.983
Oh, yeah? Well...

04:44.985 --> 04:47.286
you have a sister as well.

04:47.288 --> 04:51.256
Oh, Stewie, I-I could never
come up with stuff like you do.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.791
Of course not.
You're sweet and simple.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.926
But even you could learn
enough to outsmart

04:54.928 --> 04:56.461
those cretins at your school.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.963
And they'll respect you for it.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.931
In fact, I'll teach you how.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.099
Why would you do that for me?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.801
I'm your brother, Chris.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.603
We're a team and we've got
to look out for each other.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.105
Like Owl and Costello.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.440
I mean the fellow's
name on first base.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.008
Who.
The fellow playing first base.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.643
Who.
The guy on first base.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.845
Who.
I'm asking you who's on first!

05:13.847 --> 05:16.315
Who.
That's what I'm asking you!

05:16.317 --> 05:20.519
Nothing will ever be funnier
than misunderstandings.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.292
All right, Chris,
here they come.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.794
Now, remember what we practiced.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.295
Now, what are you gonna call
the one in the middle?

05:30.297 --> 05:31.997
Isosceles triangle?

05:31.999 --> 05:32.998
What?! Come on, Chris!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.166
We worked on this all night.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.968
I know! I also had
a geometry test!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.537
Well, how'd that go?

05:43.042 --> 05:44.509
Hey, look who it is.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.877
Dorky Pig.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.212
Go on, Chris. It's now or never.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.547
Let them have it.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.648
Nice muscles.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.883
What, do you belong to a gym?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.352
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.387
Here, put me on your back
and repeat what I say.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.990
Quick! Here they come!

05:58.992 --> 06:01.393
You're even uglier
up close, Griffin.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.862
Okay, now say...
(indistinct whispering)

06:03.864 --> 06:06.531
I heard you were born
out of your mom's butt.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.334
I heard that from your mom
while I was doing her.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.869
You're a butt baby.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.171
That's why you've got moles
all over your chest.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.340
Leftover birth dook.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.908
(all laughing)

06:16.910 --> 06:18.677
Oh, man!
Griffin schooled him!

06:18.679 --> 06:20.178
I can't believe I'm
moving tomorrow,

06:20.180 --> 06:22.514
and I won't get to see
how this works out.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.850
Wow, Stewie, we're gonna
work perfectly together.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.519
Like Sherlock
Holmes and Watson.

06:27.521 --> 06:28.754
Watson, a clue!

06:28.756 --> 06:30.722
The intruder has
tracked in a red clay,

06:30.724 --> 06:34.059
which can only be found near
London's homosexual bathhouse.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.360
Amazing, Holmes.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.528
How did you know that?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.097
Just from, like,
books and stuff.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.936
Your turn.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.440
You know, Peter, it's so nice

06:48.442 --> 06:50.242
that after all these years
we've been together,

06:50.244 --> 06:51.710
we can still...
Smoke break!

06:51.712 --> 06:53.545
What? Peter, what are you
doing down there?

06:53.547 --> 06:54.780
Nothing.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.581
Well, it doesn't
seem like nothing.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.217
(coughing)

06:59.219 --> 07:01.453
Peter, since when
are you a smoker?

07:01.455 --> 07:02.888
Put that out right now!

07:02.890 --> 07:04.756
Smoking is highly addictive.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.957
I'm not addicted.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.559
I just need a couple
every hour or so,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.060
so I don't go
completely insane.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.229
Peter, that's exactly
what addicted means.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.064
You have a serious problem.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.566
Cigarettes will kill you.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.568
Relax, Lois.
I can quit any time I want.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.037
Look, I'll toss
this one out right now.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.141
I'm so sorry I threw you
out the window!

07:25.645 --> 07:27.913
Hey, man, can you keep it down?

07:27.915 --> 07:30.115
Sorry.
Wait, whose bedroom are you in?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.149
Meg's.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.350
Okay, that's fine then.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.424
Where's Dad?

07:39.426 --> 07:42.861
Your father got up early
and went for a run.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.664
Ah, nothing
like an after-run mint

07:45.666 --> 07:48.633
to get rid
of that jogger's breath.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.469
Okay, now sit down
and have some breakfast.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.304
I made your favorite--
waffles and...

07:52.306 --> 07:54.873
Hey, uh, did anybody get
the paper today?

07:58.344 --> 07:59.811
Ah, nothing
like an after-paper mint

07:59.813 --> 08:02.514
to get rid
of that paper-getting breath.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.449
You know, I feel like
these waffles could use

08:04.451 --> 08:06.451
a little fresh air.
Come on, boys.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.452
Peter, sit down.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.588
You need your breakfast.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.665
Oh, Peter,
I meant to tell you.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.201
Remember my cousin Sylvia's
husband Robert? Well...

08:23.203 --> 08:24.870
Does this story
have an end?!

08:24.872 --> 08:26.471
Peter, I just started.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.039
Oh, Meg's out of milk.
I'll get you a carton.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.140
Hey, good story, Lois.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.243
You wrapped it up nicely.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.682
I know it's technically
not illegal,

08:37.684 --> 08:40.318
but it seemed wrong when
your music teacher wrapped

08:40.320 --> 08:42.988
a trash bag around his waist
so he could change pants.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.156
BOY:
Hey, Jew-bacca!

08:45.158 --> 08:48.527
Passover's stupid and I'm gonna
prove it by breaking your nose.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.995
Hey!

08:49.997 --> 08:52.163
Why don't you pick on someone
your own religion

08:52.165 --> 08:53.999
who can fight for themselves?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.367
And you're not so tough.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.502
You frequently opt
out of swim class

08:57.504 --> 09:00.238
because of your gross
microcephalic penis.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.406
It's not gross!

09:01.408 --> 09:02.674
It's special.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.510
I can use it
to reset my cable box.

09:05.512 --> 09:09.180
Hey, Chris, what you did there
for that sweaty Jew?

09:09.182 --> 09:10.682
That was really nice.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.083
Back away, foul wench!

09:12.085 --> 09:15.720
Your wide hips hold
no temptation for me!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.355
Uh... I mean...

09:17.357 --> 09:18.790
you have...

09:20.192 --> 09:21.526
...a-a vulva...

09:21.528 --> 09:23.528
and fallopian tubes.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.196
Finally!
A guy who listens!

09:25.198 --> 09:28.600
Here's my number.
Call me.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.206
Peter, when'd you
start smoking?

09:35.208 --> 09:38.043
Well, you know, at first
it was a way to get out of work,

09:38.045 --> 09:40.045
but then I discovered
it's a delightful habit

09:40.047 --> 09:42.113
that has lots of benefits.
Yeah? Like what?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.382
Like I get to punctuate
tough conversations

09:44.384 --> 09:45.884
by ashing a cigarette.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.419
Joe, your
marriage is over.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.121
Oh, please. Bonnie and I
are stronger than ever.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.390
Your marriage...

09:52.392 --> 09:54.559
is over.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.127
(sizzling)

09:56.129 --> 10:00.031
(sighs): Well, now that you
say it with the cigarette...

10:05.805 --> 10:09.107
God, there's, like, no one hot
at this school this year.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.509
Okay, students, take your seats.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.613
First off, we have a new rule:

10:14.615 --> 10:17.315
no more asking the gym teachers
if they went to college.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.117
They did not.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.087
Next, it's time for nominations
for student body president.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.656
As of now, we have
the perpetually upbeat black kid

10:24.658 --> 10:26.424
running unopposed.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.995
Come on, yo, this is gonna be
a great year for all of us!

10:29.997 --> 10:31.429
Surely there's another student

10:31.431 --> 10:33.598
who'd like to throw
his hat in the ring.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.300
I nominate Chris Griffin!

10:35.302 --> 10:37.035
(cheering and applause)

10:37.837 --> 10:39.471
Chris, they love you.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.940
I'm a better coach
than God.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.975
Come on, you're getting
crucified out there!

10:43.977 --> 10:45.777
JESUS:
I know. It's
a crucifixion.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.278
Well, yeah, I know.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.813
But that doesn't mean
you should stop trying.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.182
Dad, you're not
the coach!

10:54.620 --> 10:56.187
(farting)

10:56.189 --> 10:59.624
(gasps)
Peter, your fart didn't
go off until 8:30.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.860
Get up. We're late!

11:04.130 --> 11:05.997
(gasps)
What the hell?!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.532
What? What? What?!
Peter,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.300
i-it's horrible!

11:09.302 --> 11:11.503
STEWIE:
Other people
live here!

11:11.505 --> 11:13.505
Oh, my God!

11:13.507 --> 11:15.040
How did this happen?!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.341
It's from smoking!

11:16.343 --> 11:17.509
It's not that bad.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.177
Peter, you can't live
like this.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.845
I'm taking you
to Dr. Hartman.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.547
No! I hate the doctor!

11:22.549 --> 11:24.049
Are you sure?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.717
There are Cheez-Its in there.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.752
Cheez-Its?!

11:28.654 --> 11:30.555
Huh? W-Wait. What's going on?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.190
I'm scared! I'm scared!

11:32.192 --> 11:34.225
Oh, it's nighttime.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.227
Good night.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.333
Mr. Griffin, I'm gonna need
to ask you a few questions.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.836
Do you think I can jump
and touch that pipe up there?

11:44.838 --> 11:47.205
I don't know.
The hell I can't!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.540
There, got it.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.341
Yeah, I guess
your fingertips grazed it.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.177
Yeah, that counts
as a dunk.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.846
Dr. Hartman, we're here for you
to help Peter quit smoking.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.082
Mrs. Griffin, I can't do
that. It's an addiction.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.517
I can't even get my
son to quit being gay.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.020
Well, you got to do something!
He's killing himself!

12:02.022 --> 12:04.923
(groans)
All right, how many Vicodins for
you guys to just leave me alone?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.424
Forty.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.228
Well, it's too bad
Dr. Hartman couldn't help us.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
I guess we should go
to the Stop Smoking Clinic

12:12.232 --> 12:14.833
and then maybe get
a couple bottles of wine.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.372
Oh, hey, Stewie.
Ready to go to school?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.742
Well, actually, Chris,
I've got good news.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.710
Aw, I'll take
the bad news first.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.378
No. What? There
is no bad news.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.547
Oh, all right. Then give me
the good news first.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.383
(sighs)
The good news is, I've taught
you everything you need to know

12:32.385 --> 12:33.885
to fend for yourself.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.588
So from now on, you can
go to school without me.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.756
What are you talking about?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.290
I'm running for class president.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.725
I need you!

12:40.727 --> 12:42.427
What are you doing?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.963
You're coming to school with me
whether you like it or not!

12:44.965 --> 12:46.965
Let me out! You can't keep me
in here forever!

12:46.967 --> 12:48.566
I have too many plans
for the future!

12:48.568 --> 12:50.135
I'll never win a Nobel Prize!

12:50.137 --> 12:51.970
I'll never be a member
of Parliament!

12:51.972 --> 12:54.272
I'll never get to express
disappointment with young people

12:54.274 --> 12:56.241
while putting in my dentures!

12:56.243 --> 12:58.076
Stupid younger generation.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.112
Back in my day, we had
Katy Perry, Justin Bieber.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.747
That was real music.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.049
(slurping sounds)

13:13.959 --> 13:15.460
Lois, why do all the people
in here look

13:15.462 --> 13:16.928
like Emperor Palpatine?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.097
Because they're all
heavy smokers, Peter.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.832
I'm gonna sign you in.

13:22.301 --> 13:26.671
Would the driver of a 1978
Camaro please move your car?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.907
(others coughing)

13:30.776 --> 13:32.644
Man, how the hell
am I gonna quit smoking?

13:32.646 --> 13:35.780
I wish smoking
could just quit me instead.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.348
Thank you
for meeting me here.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.818
I have something
very important to tell you.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.953
I have something
important to tell you, too.

13:41.955 --> 13:45.223
Peter, I think we
should see other people.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.892
(tearfully):
Okay.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.464
Uh, good, that's what
I was gonna say, too.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.034
Excuse me, I'm Mr. Stone
with the ad agency

13:56.036 --> 13:58.036
of Anderson, Wheeler
and Thirdname.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.840
And I think you'd be perfect for
our new anti-smoking campaign.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.375
Me? You'd want me on TV?

14:04.377 --> 14:05.677
Even though I'm hideous?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.645
Sure. Have you seen
<i>Boardwalk Empire?</i>

14:07.647 --> 14:09.981
It's just a crap-fest
of faces.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.650
There is one catch: if you're
gonna be our spokesman,

14:12.652 --> 14:14.185
you have to keep smoking.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.321
We need you to stay wrinkled
and sickly.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.990
But my wife brought me here
to quit smoking.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.692
(chuckles)
Wives, huh?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.727
O-Okay,
now I'm on your side!

14:22.729 --> 14:23.895
Oh, this is awesome!

14:23.897 --> 14:25.196
I'm gonna be on TV!

14:25.198 --> 14:27.198
But no more talk
of quitting, right?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.167
You got it. So, um,

14:29.169 --> 14:30.902
does somethin' like this
pay a lot of money?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.871
What do you think
a lot of money is?

14:32.873 --> 14:35.907
I-I don't want to say.
I'm embarrassed.

14:42.181 --> 14:45.350
ANNOUNCER:
And now a word from
the American Lung Association.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.685
Oh, hey, hey, guys! Here
comes one of my TV spots!

14:47.687 --> 14:50.021
Hi, Peter Griffin,
sickly smoker.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.023
This is your heart.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.559
This is your heart
on cigarettes.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.027
Any questions?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.996
Yeah, where'd you get
that heart?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.866
Hey, Peter, now that
you're a celebrity,

15:01.868 --> 15:03.868
could I get a picture
of you to put on the wall?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.036
Sure, here you go.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.537
Thanks, man.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.539
I'll put you up next
to these black celebrities

15:08.541 --> 15:10.909
who are just
confusing strangers to you.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.410
Who's Marlin Johnson?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.746
Oh, come on, man.
Stand-up comedian?

15:14.748 --> 15:17.916
He got that whole thing
about the "Oh-Ee-Oh-Ee-Hey-Yo."

15:17.918 --> 15:20.785
(laughing):
I can't even
get through it.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.787
BLACK MAN:
Hey! You talkin'
'bout Marlin Johnson?

15:22.789 --> 15:25.223
You know it!
Oh-Ee-Oh-Ee-Hey-Yo!

15:25.225 --> 15:28.126
(chuckles)
That's right.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.131
Hey, Lois.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.633
Peter, I saw your ad on TV,
and I got to say,

15:35.635 --> 15:37.969
I'm glad you're finally
doing the right thing.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.738
Yeah, it feels good
to be helping people.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.308
Peter, what are you doing?!
I thought you quit!

15:43.310 --> 15:45.443
Hey, if George Michael
doesn't have to give up butts,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.679
why should I?

15:49.581 --> 15:52.450
I'm serious.
You have to stop smoking!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.085
Have you looked in the mirror?
You look terrible.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.820
Eh, what do you care?

15:55.822 --> 15:58.256
It's not like you have to look
at my face when we have sex.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.458
Not since we started
role-playing.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.460
Peter, I'm ready.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.263
Okay, now put on yours.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.599
Wow, isn't it weird that
we both picked Mario Lopez?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.768
Yes, Peter.
It's very weird.

16:10.770 --> 16:15.006
Yeah, it shows that we both
go Latino but soft Latino.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.512
Day five of my imprisonment
inside Chris' backpack.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.614
Feces and the buildup thereof
continues to be

16:23.616 --> 16:25.183
my number one problem.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.518
I think a teacher saw me
the other day but said nothing.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.554
I waved and he looked away.

16:35.694 --> 16:38.463
This could be my chance
to escape this canvas cage!

16:38.465 --> 16:40.698
(grunting)

16:44.536 --> 16:45.737
(toilet flushes)

16:49.541 --> 16:51.809
That sounds like an open door.
Which way is out?

16:51.811 --> 16:53.711
STUDENT:
God, I love walking
in the hall!

16:53.713 --> 16:55.246
There! That way!

16:57.649 --> 16:59.217
Must escape!

17:01.186 --> 17:03.755
(slurred):
Must... escape.

17:06.725 --> 17:09.727
Mu...
(mumbling)

17:10.529 --> 17:13.731
You're gonna die in there.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.403
Welcome back,
Mr. Griffin!

17:18.405 --> 17:19.404
You look terrible!

17:19.406 --> 17:21.172
Thanks, man named Sandy!

17:21.174 --> 17:23.207
Oh, hey, uh, you know,
I don't know if you're the guy

17:23.209 --> 17:25.209
to talk to about this,
but when I went to my trailer

17:25.211 --> 17:27.512
this morning, there was
a hairy naked guy in it.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.013
We don't provide trailers.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.349
We're just next door
to a trailer park.
Ah.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.185
That would explain the violent
lovemaking that followed.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.020
Listen, Peter, we need to talk.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.190
I'm sorry to tell you this, but
we no longer need your services.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.691
Wait... What?

17:40.693 --> 17:42.560
How could you do that?!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.095
Well, I went to a NASCAR event

17:44.097 --> 17:46.397
and realized you're just
an average-looking man.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.066
Please! I'll do anything
to keep my job!

17:48.068 --> 17:49.934
N-Name anything you want
and I'll do it!

17:49.936 --> 17:52.136
Touch your toes.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.274
Please give me
something else!

17:56.276 --> 17:59.410
I'm sorry, Peter,
it's over.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.246
(crying)

18:02.248 --> 18:04.949
(creepily):
Why are your eyes
crying, Peter?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.584
They fired me, Larry!

18:06.586 --> 18:09.587
Come on. Let's go kidnap
my neighbor's dog

18:09.589 --> 18:12.657
and tell them
we don't have it.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.630
Good morning, students.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.300
First of all, I don't care
what the courts say,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.402
let's thank
the Christian God together.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.137
Now then, we're here today

18:26.139 --> 18:28.406
for the presidential candidate
debate.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.908
Okay, remember,
people think I'm smart now.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.244
So it's got to be clever
and it's got to pop.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.480
I'm done! I'm not
saying another word.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.415
You can't hold me prisoner
in here forever!

18:37.417 --> 18:40.785
Why not?
Name one person who loves you.

18:40.787 --> 18:44.755
Wow. Not a
proportional response.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.958
All right, let's begin
with an opening statement

18:46.960 --> 18:50.595
from the perpetually upbeat
black kid.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.963
Thanks for letting me go first.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.931
I got an hour-and-a-half drive
home after this.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.600
You're not getting it,
Chris, are you?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.768
You were being bullied
day in and day out,

18:57.770 --> 18:59.170
so I tried to help you.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.838
I tried to be a good brother.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.640
And you've repaid me with abuse.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.343
You're the bully, Chris Griffin.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.882
Oh, my God.
You're right.

19:12.951 --> 19:16.988
PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD:
And now an opening statement
from our second candidate,

19:16.990 --> 19:19.524
the King of the Zingers,
Chris Griffin.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.993
(cheering and applause)

19:21.995 --> 19:23.661
Go easy on me, Chris.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.630
My sister has M.S.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.999
I'm worried what you're
gonna do with that.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.301
I'm out. I'm not running.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.836
And neither is she.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.704
I knew you'd
have something.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.039
No, you don't understand.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.208
I'm dropping out
of the election.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.543
(murmuring)

19:38.545 --> 19:39.810
I'm a big fraud,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
and I've treated people
terribly.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.883
Much like Jeff Zucker
when he ran NBC.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.852
I'm sorry, Stewie.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.153
Can you forgive me?

19:49.155 --> 19:52.056
Well, I may no longer be
on your back,

19:52.058 --> 19:55.560
but I'll always be on your side.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.164
(sighs)
All right,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.400
this election is postponed.
Go back to class.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.001
Oh, and another thing,

20:04.003 --> 20:06.204
stop making fun of teachers
who don't have cars.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.608
Life's not as easy as you think
it's gonna be right now.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.716
You know, Chris, what you did on
that stage took a lot of guts.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.351
Thanks, Stewie.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.853
And thanks to you, I'm no
longer getting bullied.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.222
Well, that's great.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.357
I guess we put those bullies
in their place, huh?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.559
Yeah. Two of them
shot themselves.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.861
Oh, that's so good
to hear, Chris.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.697
Are they done?
They're-they're all done?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.565
Okay, all right,
let's finish ours.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.236
Well, I finally quit smoking and
I'm ready to go back to normal!

20:38.238 --> 20:39.870
Peter, that's not
how it works.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.206
The damage you've done
is irreversible.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.542
Yeah, Lois is right.
As bad as you look,

20:44.544 --> 20:47.044
the damage you've done
to your heart and your lungs is,

20:47.046 --> 20:49.380
no doubt,
exponentially worse.
What?!

20:49.382 --> 20:51.916
Well, try cuttin' to the outside
of the house over some music.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.918
That usually works.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.955
♪

20:57.957 --> 20:59.790
(bleep)
