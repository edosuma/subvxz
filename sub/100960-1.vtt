00:26.953 --> 00:29.319
<i>Mornin', folks.
It's Slicer here</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:31.388
<i>with your local guide
to golf.</i>

00:31.390 --> 00:33.658
<i>Well, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tee.</i>

00:33.660 --> 00:36.359
<i>You get that?</i>

00:37.997 --> 00:40.230
<i>Always play with somebody
better than you,</i>

00:40.232 --> 00:41.999
<i>especially if you made
them that way.</i>

00:46.639 --> 00:48.405
Jar-min!

00:48.407 --> 00:51.408
Ji-min.

00:51.410 --> 00:54.344
Hi. I'm Debra...

00:54.346 --> 00:56.647
Daryl's sister.

00:56.649 --> 00:59.582
You could call me...
You can call me aunt,

00:59.584 --> 01:01.786
or auntie,

01:01.788 --> 01:02.787
or whatever you like.

01:02.789 --> 01:04.757
It's okay.

01:07.627 --> 01:08.928
We're family now.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.530
Five bucks he makes this one.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.233
Yeah.

01:32.819 --> 01:35.986
- Who shot that?
- Albatross Al.

01:35.988 --> 01:39.355
Albatross.
What's an albatross?

01:39.357 --> 01:42.292
Three under par.

01:42.294 --> 01:43.526
Al shot two
in a tournament once.

01:43.528 --> 01:46.063
We witnessed it.

01:48.835 --> 01:52.502
Debalicious Debbie Deb Debs.

01:52.504 --> 01:54.370
What's with the Oriental?

01:54.372 --> 01:56.606
It's Asian.

01:56.608 --> 01:58.976
It's my bother's daughter.

01:58.978 --> 02:02.445
I have custody now.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.314
That's right. Darryl died.

02:04.316 --> 02:05.850
Who died?

02:05.852 --> 02:07.419
And why didn't I hear about it?

02:10.489 --> 02:13.691
- What's with the Oriental?
- It's Asian.

02:13.693 --> 02:15.592
Daryl willed her to Debra.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.594
Well, that was an asshole move.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.997
I wish I got to embalm him.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.500
Jar-min...

02:23.870 --> 02:25.069
Ji-min.

02:30.643 --> 02:32.977
Well, let's get you to school.

02:32.979 --> 02:35.578
Right? Meet some new friends.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.715
Come on. Come on.

02:37.717 --> 02:40.617
Oh, and there's a golf team
that you can join.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.854
Right, Patrick?

02:44.056 --> 02:46.690
Albatross Al...

02:46.692 --> 02:48.593
Made me another five bucks,
buddy.

02:50.529 --> 02:53.764
- How you doing, Al?
- Oh, pretty well, pretty well.

02:53.766 --> 02:56.066
That's too bad.

02:56.068 --> 02:59.036
You playing in the innovational
with the Undertaker here?

02:59.038 --> 03:00.805
No, I'm not signing up for that.

03:00.807 --> 03:03.741
Dr. Al Wiserman missing
a day of golf.

03:03.743 --> 03:05.709
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

03:05.711 --> 03:07.912
I'm not ready to be buried yet.

03:07.914 --> 03:09.647
Nah, I'll just play around him.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.414
You won't even see me.

03:11.416 --> 03:13.616
Sorry. Can't be done.

03:13.618 --> 03:15.653
- Why not?
- New rules.

03:15.655 --> 03:18.789
If you're not playing
or a paying spectator,

03:18.791 --> 03:20.925
you're not allowed
on the course.

03:20.927 --> 03:23.828
Ah, I guess you gotta do
what you gotta do.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.096
Maybe I can get my son to play.
I can give him a call.

03:26.098 --> 03:28.666
It's good timing.
It's the last day to sign up.

03:28.668 --> 03:29.802
All right.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.606
God sakes.

03:36.608 --> 03:38.678
- I need my balls.
- You sure do.

03:44.917 --> 03:48.185
- Morning, Doctor.
- You're not returning my calls.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.887
I don't wanna hear it.

03:49.889 --> 03:51.421
But you're playing every day.

03:51.423 --> 03:53.090
Never miss one.

03:53.092 --> 03:54.591
Join me?

03:54.593 --> 03:56.526
You know I don't play here.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.595
You notice any changes yet?

03:58.597 --> 03:59.930
Yeah.

03:59.932 --> 04:01.765
This morning.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.001
The trim along the green
was a lot tighter.

04:04.003 --> 04:05.769
I'm not talking about golf, Al.

04:05.771 --> 04:07.537
You need to come in
and start your treatments.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.539
If I do, I won't be able to hit
a golf ball straight,

04:09.541 --> 04:11.108
and you damn well know it.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.911
Al, being a bad hooker is better
than losing your life.

04:13.913 --> 04:17.983
Well, we have different
priorities.

04:22.088 --> 04:25.488
<i>How do you find
a partner worthy to play with?</i>

04:25.490 --> 04:28.558
- <i>That's luck.</i>
- <i>That's luck, people.</i>

04:28.560 --> 04:29.994
<i>I hope you have it.</i>

04:29.996 --> 04:31.731
<i>Five, five, five tee time.</i>

04:35.533 --> 04:38.002
Dr. Newbody's got the rest
of your patients.

04:38.004 --> 04:40.037
So go ahead and look
at your balls.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.840
- Mm-hmm-hmm.
- Dr. Wiserman.

04:42.842 --> 04:44.642
Right? More like Dr. Olderman.

04:44.644 --> 04:46.710
Just kidding.

04:46.712 --> 04:48.611
A lot of people are having
trouble seeing around here.

04:48.613 --> 04:50.080
Right? But I can see.

04:50.082 --> 04:53.050
My headquarters sent
a Newbody down here.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.551
I'm so sorry.
It's just... I'm doing wordplay.

04:55.553 --> 04:56.887
And I get...

04:56.889 --> 04:59.189
- Men's league later today.
- Hmm.

04:59.191 --> 05:00.858
I've been practicing, so...

05:00.860 --> 05:02.592
See you out there, partner.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.796
Right?

05:07.133 --> 05:08.801
Later, dude.

05:31.991 --> 05:33.092
Cole.

05:36.762 --> 05:37.830
Jennifer.

05:40.199 --> 05:42.134
Kathy.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.708
Spencer.

05:51.911 --> 05:53.611
Ji-min.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.115
Ji-min.

05:59.617 --> 06:02.987
Okay, kids.
We are putting Fern Hall

06:02.989 --> 06:04.757
on the map this year.

06:05.758 --> 06:09.559
We have some diversity.

06:09.561 --> 06:12.830
We won't even let
our competition pass the apron.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.734
Follow me.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.807
All right. Loosey-goosey.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.776
Loosey-goosey.

06:25.778 --> 06:28.214
Let's grab our best shafts.

06:30.683 --> 06:33.684
Jin...

06:33.686 --> 06:36.687
You seem to only have one.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.089
Why don't you start
things off for us?

06:39.091 --> 06:41.160
Namaste.

07:01.013 --> 07:04.214
- Try again, hon.
- She doesn't have any balls.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.785
- Wait, you can use mine.
- Mine are bigger.

07:07.787 --> 07:09.186
Don't worry about teeing up.

07:09.188 --> 07:11.023
Just drop your balls
and whack 'em.

07:12.624 --> 07:13.859
Thanks.

07:25.237 --> 07:28.205
I thought Koreans
were good at golf.

07:28.207 --> 07:33.010
Kathy, you're up next.

07:33.012 --> 07:34.678
I hope you're better
than last year.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.682
Need some new tees,
Chopsticks?

07:38.684 --> 07:40.918
- What'd you say, bitch?
- Look, oriental...

07:40.920 --> 07:45.289
Put the irons down.
Relax and breathe.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.291
Suck a dick.

07:47.293 --> 07:52.196
Excuse me?
That is not sportsmanlike.

07:52.198 --> 07:57.203
You will never be on this team
with that attitude, jimbo girl.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.118
Look at this.

08:30.369 --> 08:33.470
Maybe we should keep kids
off the course.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.938
Weren't you just like her, Al?

08:35.941 --> 08:37.977
Yeah, an angry Asian girl, huh?

08:43.249 --> 08:44.717
Damn it to hell.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.421
<i>In the news,
a 91-year-old player</i>

08:51.423 --> 08:54.892
<i>on the senior tour has
a new lease on life after...</i>

08:54.894 --> 08:56.960
It's not looking good, Deb.

08:56.962 --> 08:58.462
We're down to 22.

08:58.464 --> 09:01.198
Are the men done yet?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.467
I want to play.

09:03.469 --> 09:06.937
So are you coming this weekend?

09:06.939 --> 09:10.941
Girl, I am coming
whenever you tell me to.

09:10.943 --> 09:12.843
Hey, can I come?

09:12.845 --> 09:15.946
Both of you? Ew.

09:15.948 --> 09:17.814
Whoa.

09:17.816 --> 09:19.516
Debalicious...

09:19.518 --> 09:22.019
You gotta get control
of your Asian.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.954
Who is that?

09:23.956 --> 09:25.856
Debra's inheritance.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.258
That's lucky.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.695
I was disowned.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.130
- Oh, shit.
- What?

09:36.335 --> 09:39.536
You're never gonna get it
in the hole, Eugene!

09:39.538 --> 09:41.340
Give it up!

09:52.484 --> 09:55.485
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

09:55.487 --> 09:57.221
I see what you're doing, Mother.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.156
Helping you lose members?

09:59.158 --> 10:00.824
You're damn right.

10:00.826 --> 10:03.794
This place is gonna make
a terrific strip mall.

10:03.796 --> 10:06.330
Grandpa said it stays open
as long as we have members.

10:06.332 --> 10:08.131
Which won't be much longer

10:08.133 --> 10:10.234
if I have anything
to say about it.

10:10.236 --> 10:11.902
Face it, Debra.

10:11.904 --> 10:16.039
Golf is a dying old man's sport.

10:16.041 --> 10:18.909
This must be the hybrid.

10:18.911 --> 10:21.545
This is your granddaughter.

10:21.547 --> 10:23.247
So he said...

10:23.249 --> 10:25.916
16 years after the fact.

10:25.918 --> 10:30.220
Honey, this is your
grandmother, Pearl.

10:30.222 --> 10:33.290
She doesn't look
a thing like Darryl.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.993
- Thank God.
- Hey!

10:35.995 --> 10:38.362
That's your father
you're talking about.

10:38.364 --> 10:42.065
He died serving his country.
You should show a little respect.

10:42.067 --> 10:45.569
He died from food poisoning
at a whorehouse off base.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.571
Is that where
he met your mother?

10:47.573 --> 10:49.072
Oh, my God.

10:49.074 --> 10:50.142
We're family.

10:52.077 --> 10:55.078
- Can I go play?
- No.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.481
I'm not paying
for a membership for her.

10:57.483 --> 10:59.116
Yes. Go ahead.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.486
You can play as a guest.

11:02.388 --> 11:04.554
You're gonna let her play
wearing that?

11:04.556 --> 11:07.126
Oh, my God, Mother.
You show up looking like a tee warmer.

11:09.194 --> 11:11.263
What the fuck is a tee warmer?

11:12.564 --> 11:14.598
- Yeah, right over it.
- I made it!

11:14.600 --> 11:17.000
I made it! I'm here, guys.

11:17.002 --> 11:19.102
I'm here, partner.

11:19.104 --> 11:21.571
Yeah, now you know
why I play solo.

11:21.573 --> 11:23.573
Nobody sees your greatness
when you're solo, Al.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.175
Yeah, I see what Al can't,

11:25.177 --> 11:27.077
which is his patience mostly.

11:27.079 --> 11:29.579
- Hey, Al. Is that your cart?
- Yeah.

11:29.581 --> 11:33.317
And you're not gonna push mine
into the pond, kiddo.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.218
Merle, one inch left of the cup.

11:35.220 --> 11:38.522
The other left.

11:38.524 --> 11:41.958
So, uh, can I play
with you guys?

11:41.960 --> 11:44.194
I can only play with members.

11:44.196 --> 11:45.329
What's your handicap?

11:45.331 --> 11:47.665
Al's a one.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.400
Yeah, one big old handicap.
He's going blind.

11:50.402 --> 11:54.239
Yeah, that's why
I didn't see you there.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.442
So you're like a pro or...

11:58.444 --> 12:00.110
Teach a class?
Need a partner?

12:00.112 --> 12:02.647
What? No. Who are you?

12:02.649 --> 12:04.649
Ji-min Kurt, sir.

12:04.651 --> 12:06.983
Kurt. I didn't know Deb
had a kid.

12:06.985 --> 12:09.654
She's my aunt.
Darryl was my dad.

12:09.656 --> 12:13.924
Darryl died?
Sorry to hear that.

12:13.926 --> 12:16.593
That's okay.

12:16.595 --> 12:18.929
He was an asshole anyways.

12:18.931 --> 12:21.198
- May I?
- No.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.033
Nobody sits here.

12:26.405 --> 12:28.505
Huh? What's that supposed
to mean?

12:28.507 --> 12:30.340
Crazy person or something?

12:30.342 --> 12:33.276
Yeah, but you're a crazy person
that owns this game, sir.

12:33.278 --> 12:37.114
Kiddo, nobody owns this game.

12:37.116 --> 12:39.383
You only borrow it.

12:49.328 --> 12:50.429
- Hello, Deb.
- Hey, Al.

12:52.398 --> 12:54.998
Sorry to hear about
your brother.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.334
Yeah, so am I.

12:57.336 --> 12:59.169
I only wish he would have
married Jim's mom

12:59.171 --> 13:00.971
so she'd get
the social security checks.

13:00.973 --> 13:04.241
Mm-hmm. Oh, damn it,

13:04.243 --> 13:06.711
I lost my partner
for this weekend.

13:06.713 --> 13:09.680
I wish I had a partner to lose.

13:09.682 --> 13:11.515
Al, you don't have
to play every day.

13:11.517 --> 13:13.684
Oh, yes, I do.

13:13.686 --> 13:16.486
You wanna play with me
this weekend?

13:16.488 --> 13:19.156
Oh, no, no.
I can't even get it in the hole.

13:19.158 --> 13:20.691
I'll take that dare.

13:20.693 --> 13:23.628
What about you, Tracy?

13:23.630 --> 13:25.364
I don't play with boys.

13:28.233 --> 13:31.568
Hey, Deb.
What about your niece?

13:31.570 --> 13:33.638
She looks like
she wants to play.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.372
Maybe I can teach her
a few things.

13:35.374 --> 13:36.709
So could I.

13:37.744 --> 13:40.510
Yeah. Please.

13:40.512 --> 13:43.748
Keep it.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.115
Thanks, Al.

13:52.191 --> 13:53.358
Can I have another one?

13:54.426 --> 13:56.259
- You play?
- Yes, sir.

13:56.261 --> 13:58.061
Is that the only club you got?

13:58.063 --> 14:01.198
My dad's best six-iron?
It'll do in a fix, sir.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.332
He didn't leave you
the whole bag?

14:02.334 --> 14:03.768
His best friend got those.

14:03.770 --> 14:04.769
You ever play
in a tournament before?

14:04.771 --> 14:06.036
No, sir.

14:06.038 --> 14:07.270
Wanna play with me this weekend?

14:07.272 --> 14:08.505
Oh, I'd love to, sir.

14:08.507 --> 14:10.073
I want to be as good as you.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.676
Well, it's a best ball
tournament,

14:11.678 --> 14:13.210
so we'll use my ball.

14:13.212 --> 14:15.111
Or mine.

14:16.683 --> 14:19.382
All right.
How do you spell your name?

14:19.384 --> 14:22.020
J-I... dash...

14:23.589 --> 14:25.222
Dash.

14:25.224 --> 14:27.694
M-I-N.

14:38.771 --> 14:40.838
Hey, kid, it's Dad.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.540
Too bad you can't make
the invitational.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.575
I found a partner, though.

14:45.577 --> 14:47.544
Well, sort of.

14:47.546 --> 14:51.214
Let me know when you can come up
and play again, huh?

14:51.216 --> 14:53.583
I'll be out there every day.

14:53.585 --> 14:54.721
Love you.

15:12.805 --> 15:15.040
I got a new partner today.

15:16.275 --> 15:19.244
Yeah, she's not very good.

15:22.481 --> 15:25.752
Yeah, it's a girl.
What, are you jealous?

15:52.544 --> 15:54.144
Aunt Debra, are you vacuuming?

15:54.146 --> 15:55.445
What?

15:55.447 --> 15:57.316
No. No.

15:59.384 --> 16:01.752
I heard it last night, too.

16:01.754 --> 16:05.188
I thought you had
your headphones on.

16:05.190 --> 16:08.191
- I can help.
- Hey, uh, no. Hey, listen.

16:08.193 --> 16:12.429
Um, you wanna skip school?

16:12.431 --> 16:14.765
Here. How about that?

16:14.767 --> 16:18.234
Um, we got this bike outside.
Here. Wear that.

16:18.236 --> 16:19.569
There's a dress code
at the club.

16:19.571 --> 16:22.238
And, uh, go have some fun.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.775
Yeah. Hit some balls around.

16:24.777 --> 16:27.611
<i>The sun is out,
the sun is shining,</i>

16:27.613 --> 16:29.947
<i>it's a beautiful day,
ask yourselves.</i>

16:29.949 --> 16:34.721
<i>Can we be friends with people
who do not golf?</i>

16:54.206 --> 16:58.241
- Nice shot.
- Not bad.

16:58.243 --> 17:00.878
You always get up this early?

17:00.880 --> 17:03.648
I just wanna play.

17:03.650 --> 17:05.917
All right.
Give it a shot.

17:15.292 --> 17:17.728
Well, that might have killed
a tree.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.563
Obviously, Darryl did not teach
you how to swing.

17:22.769 --> 17:24.635
Well, he didn't like being
seen with me, either.

17:24.637 --> 17:28.304
So I just kind of ended up
sneaking onto base

17:28.306 --> 17:30.273
and playing the course there.

17:30.275 --> 17:33.944
- Taught myself.
- Mm-hmm.

17:33.946 --> 17:36.348
I pulled some clubs for you.

17:38.718 --> 17:40.483
Are you serious?

17:40.485 --> 17:41.620
I have plenty.

17:43.690 --> 17:45.823
Now, this is temporary.

17:45.825 --> 17:48.661
After this, I play solo again.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.499
That bag has no wheels.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.837
Wait. Where are you going?

18:10.817 --> 18:12.384
Get your wedge.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.925
All right.

18:20.927 --> 18:22.762
Let's see what you got.

18:26.298 --> 18:28.298
No, no, no, no.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.801
You want your hands
in front of the ball.

18:30.803 --> 18:32.469
Front of the ball.

18:32.471 --> 18:34.772
Your weight has to be
on your left leg.

18:34.774 --> 18:37.641
And don't be afraid
to be a little gentle.

18:37.643 --> 18:39.509
You don't want to kick it
around, you know what I mean?

18:39.511 --> 18:41.011
But the big thing.

18:41.013 --> 18:42.579
Follow through.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.014
Follow through.

18:44.016 --> 18:45.315
Yes, sir.

18:45.317 --> 18:47.319
All right, give it a shot.

18:54.894 --> 18:56.261
Eh...

18:58.731 --> 19:01.932
All right, kiddo,
you keep your shoulders down,

19:01.934 --> 19:03.936
your head still.

19:05.104 --> 19:07.472
And keep your eye on the ball.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.976
That's so textbook, sir.

19:11.978 --> 19:15.378
You don't have to call me sir.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.282
Well, you don't have
to call me kiddo.

19:26.058 --> 19:30.460
Hey, there's a reason
they write textbooks.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.496
Well, is that funny-ass swing
in a textbook, sir?

19:33.498 --> 19:37.335
Well, I may be old and fat,
but, uh, I'm pretty limber.

19:40.539 --> 19:43.408
Wait. Where are you going?

19:45.077 --> 19:47.445
You... You're kidding me.

19:49.048 --> 19:53.616
You hit from the ladies' tees.

19:53.618 --> 19:55.418
Take every advantage you can.

19:55.420 --> 19:59.790
So, like, how do you
visualize your shots?

19:59.792 --> 20:01.725
What? Give me a break.

20:01.727 --> 20:04.527
I'm Jewish.
I don't believe in that crap.

20:04.529 --> 20:07.898
All right,
just hit the damn ball.

20:14.841 --> 20:17.607
You lifted your head.

20:17.609 --> 20:20.911
That's one angry swing
you got there, kiddo.

20:20.913 --> 20:23.047
Now try it again...

20:23.049 --> 20:27.584
- and try not to hit it off the toe.
- Yes, sir.

20:27.586 --> 20:29.419
Now...

20:29.421 --> 20:31.689
keep your left arm straight,

20:31.691 --> 20:34.524
and stick your butt out
a little more.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.061
No, I'm serious.
If I had a cute butt, I'd show you.

20:37.063 --> 20:39.596
Don't worry about where
the ball's gonna go.

20:39.598 --> 20:43.368
Just watch that club face
hit the ball.

20:50.943 --> 20:53.177
Ah, you see?

20:53.179 --> 20:55.578
You're a natural born hooker.

21:01.921 --> 21:03.388
What?

21:05.057 --> 21:06.893
Being a hooker is not bad.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.234
Koreans win a lot,
so maybe it's in the blood.

21:17.236 --> 21:20.570
But you have to learn
to focus your anger.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.009
Well, technically,
I'm half-hillbilly, half-Korean,

21:25.011 --> 21:28.012
and an orphan,

21:28.014 --> 21:30.613
born to an asshole,
and a hooker.

21:30.615 --> 21:33.751
Well, that's not
the ball's fault.

21:33.753 --> 21:34.954
I'll see you up there.

21:40.726 --> 21:42.592
I got it.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.929
Yellow on the right.

21:44.931 --> 21:46.797
Yeah.

21:46.799 --> 21:48.766
Yeah.

21:48.768 --> 21:50.736
Woogie, woogie, woogie.
Come to Papa.

21:51.804 --> 21:54.006
What the hell?

21:56.776 --> 21:58.909
Hey, nice shot.

21:58.911 --> 22:02.012
You see how you hooked that,
huh?

22:02.014 --> 22:04.717
Now, you might wanna use
your six on this shot.

22:06.218 --> 22:08.652
What would you use?

22:08.654 --> 22:12.156
Well, I'd probably lay up
with a seven in a tournament,

22:12.158 --> 22:14.959
but, uh, you know, play it safe.

22:14.961 --> 22:19.129
But we're practicing now,
so take whatever chance you want.

22:19.131 --> 22:22.032
Is it safe to hit right now?

22:22.034 --> 22:23.968
Those guys?

22:23.970 --> 22:26.170
We'll be here till Tuesday
if we wait for them. Go ahead.

22:26.172 --> 22:28.005
Yes, sir.

22:28.007 --> 22:29.976
Okay. keep your shoulders
parallel to the ground.

22:42.254 --> 22:43.621
Yeah!

22:45.091 --> 22:47.791
- Nice shot. Was that Al?
- Yeah.

22:47.793 --> 22:49.762
Now they're moving.

22:54.266 --> 22:57.234
- Nice shot, Al.
- Wasn't mine.

22:57.236 --> 23:00.871
That ball belongs
to a girl named Jim.

23:00.873 --> 23:04.074
A girl named Jim.

23:04.076 --> 23:05.811
Well, how about that?

23:08.180 --> 23:11.150
Hello, Jim.

23:20.993 --> 23:23.093
Oh, God.

23:23.095 --> 23:25.729
You're playing with her, Al?

23:25.731 --> 23:28.098
I thought you had standards.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.802
She can hit the ball.

23:34.874 --> 23:35.906
Hey, you guys can play through.

23:35.908 --> 23:38.742
Nah. This is entertaining.

23:38.744 --> 23:39.979
Yeah, it is. Watch this.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.680
When does the club close?

23:43.682 --> 23:46.784
Sooner than they'll be off
the tee.

23:46.786 --> 23:50.122
Ah!

23:51.724 --> 23:53.824
Ah. Now...

23:53.826 --> 23:55.227
What did he do wrong?

23:57.630 --> 23:59.331
He, uh, lifted his head?

24:03.369 --> 24:06.003
So why does your calendar
only go up to September?

24:06.005 --> 24:10.207
Give me something
to look forward to.

24:10.209 --> 24:11.811
Did someone used to sit there?

24:15.114 --> 24:16.348
My wife.

24:18.150 --> 24:21.952
- Did she play?
- No.

24:21.954 --> 24:25.590
She just liked to watch me.

24:27.726 --> 24:29.728
- Ah!
- Oh!

24:31.931 --> 24:33.831
Hey, I got this one.

24:33.833 --> 24:39.036
He turned his club face out?

24:39.038 --> 24:41.371
Very good.

24:41.373 --> 24:44.241
Maybe I'm using the wrong balls,
huh, fellas?

24:44.243 --> 24:46.677
Who's balls
are you playing with?

24:46.679 --> 24:48.312
Tempo.

24:48.314 --> 24:50.714
Oh! Guys! Guys! Guys?

24:50.716 --> 24:53.117
- Hey, Deb.
- Hey.

24:53.119 --> 24:55.319
Honey, I'm sorry.
You can't be in here.

24:55.321 --> 24:57.087
It's house rules.

24:57.089 --> 25:00.724
Never mind.
I'll make my own BLT at home.

25:00.726 --> 25:02.759
You want to play
another round later?

25:02.761 --> 25:04.161
I'll come back, okay?

25:04.163 --> 25:06.029
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:06.031 --> 25:07.764
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:07.766 --> 25:08.832
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.769
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:12.138 --> 25:13.937
Okay.

25:13.939 --> 25:15.074
Okay.

25:18.177 --> 25:21.245
My father ran
a reputable place.

25:21.247 --> 25:22.882
No more.
It's gone downhill.

25:24.183 --> 25:25.949
They don't even have
a dress code.

25:25.951 --> 25:29.953
No one wants to spend the money
on golf anymore.

25:29.955 --> 25:33.724
It only costs $15
to play nine holes, Mother.

25:33.726 --> 25:38.095
Yes, and when you charge $15,
you get $15 players.

25:38.097 --> 25:40.864
Hey, uh...
everything's fine.

25:40.866 --> 25:43.467
Nothing's on fire, but, uh,
the oven's not working.

25:43.469 --> 25:46.103
So, I... I'm gonna make us,
uh, ham and cheeses.

25:46.105 --> 25:48.841
That is perfect timing.

25:50.276 --> 25:51.744
I'll call you all
from Florida.

25:55.147 --> 25:56.947
Suits. Ugh!

25:56.949 --> 26:00.083
Yo, 250 yards on seven.

26:01.153 --> 26:01.954
Here you go.

26:08.527 --> 26:12.863
Who... are you? Ooh!

26:12.865 --> 26:15.232
My name is Melissa.

26:15.234 --> 26:16.767
But you can call me Missy.

26:16.769 --> 26:18.535
- Oh!
- Missy.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.239
"Missay."

26:21.907 --> 26:24.141
Where did you come from,
Missy?

26:24.143 --> 26:25.542
My husband's a new member.

26:25.544 --> 26:28.946
Hm. Husband.

26:28.948 --> 26:31.415
- Randy.
- Randy?

26:31.417 --> 26:32.883
He needs a lot of work.

26:34.486 --> 26:37.154
So, what's crazy Pearl
up to now?

26:37.156 --> 26:38.488
She wants to sell the club.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.557
What?

26:40.559 --> 26:43.093
- I thought this place was yours.
- Yeah.

26:43.095 --> 26:45.395
If I have enough
annual memberships, yeah.

26:45.397 --> 26:48.232
Otherwise, she's gonna
turn it into a strip mall.

26:48.234 --> 26:50.267
This is my safe place.

26:50.269 --> 26:53.570
- Yeah.
- What can we do?

26:53.572 --> 26:57.074
I need more members.

26:57.076 --> 26:59.176
I'll buy a membership.

26:59.178 --> 27:02.212
Can I have 40 more like you?

27:02.214 --> 27:04.414
- To the club.
- To the club.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.952
To the club.

27:08.954 --> 27:12.391
There are 22 members left
who bring guests.

27:13.826 --> 27:16.295
I know, Harry,
but I don't care.

27:17.129 --> 27:18.895
I hate this place.

27:18.897 --> 27:20.330
My father loved it.

27:20.332 --> 27:23.033
I think he loved it
more than he loved me.

27:23.035 --> 27:25.804
God knows he played it
more than he played with me.

27:27.906 --> 27:31.842
Oh. Well.

27:31.844 --> 27:35.245
That's nice to hear.

27:35.247 --> 27:39.950
Well, you'll just have to wait
'til I get to Florida.

27:44.990 --> 27:48.091
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know.

27:48.093 --> 27:51.495
She's better than
she thinks she is.

27:51.497 --> 27:52.896
I don't know.

27:52.898 --> 27:55.232
I don't understand 'em
nowadays.

27:55.234 --> 27:58.101
She wears headphones while she
tries to swing a golf club.

27:58.103 --> 27:59.936
What is that?

27:59.938 --> 28:03.540
And they listen to
that music. Jeez.

28:03.542 --> 28:05.577
Hey. Remember?

28:07.279 --> 28:10.349
Lena Horne.
Remember we went to see her?

28:15.087 --> 28:18.090
Good times.
Good times.

28:34.106 --> 28:35.939
This might kill you, Mary.
You think you can handle that?

28:35.941 --> 28:37.574
That's the way I'm goin'.

28:37.576 --> 28:39.209
Okay, ladies.

28:39.211 --> 28:41.311
I found some extra order forms.

28:41.313 --> 28:43.914
Why do you have all of this
if you could have Dan?

28:45.551 --> 28:47.918
Oh, yeah,
she doesn't want Dan.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.389
He's "eew,"
like me.

28:51.623 --> 28:53.924
I don't think
you're "eew."

28:53.926 --> 28:56.526
I think you're yum.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.495
Well, if that's how
you ladies feel,

28:58.497 --> 29:01.164
I have the perfect gift
for all of you.

29:01.166 --> 29:04.067
This is a wireless bullet.

29:04.069 --> 29:05.402
One goes in the panty,

29:05.404 --> 29:07.672
one gives full control
to someone else.

29:07.674 --> 29:09.506
- Give it to me.
- Yeah.

29:09.508 --> 29:11.942
You wanna party?

29:11.944 --> 29:13.711
Okay, now what I'm gonna
have you ladies do,

29:13.713 --> 29:16.113
put out your finger,
I'm gonna give you a little sample.

29:16.115 --> 29:20.384
This is the whipped,
kissable, creamy lubricant.

29:22.621 --> 29:25.088
<i>Ask yourselves,
"Would I golf with them?"</i>

29:25.090 --> 29:27.557
<i>Got a caller on.
Slicer here tryin' to hit 'em straight.</i>

29:27.559 --> 29:29.226
<i>Do you play it solo or
you play with a partner?</i>

29:29.228 --> 29:30.994
<i>Who's your partner, buddy?</i>

29:30.996 --> 29:32.697
<i>Myself.
Best player I know is myself.</i>

29:33.565 --> 29:35.000
Announcement.

29:37.403 --> 29:39.970
Last night, we lost
one of our old members.

29:39.972 --> 29:42.105
Aww. Who?

29:42.107 --> 29:44.975
You know,
I don't remember names.

29:44.977 --> 29:46.677
Only coffin sizes.

29:46.679 --> 29:48.979
OMG. Are you seeing this?

29:48.981 --> 29:50.547
- Uh, are you seeing this?
- Oh!

29:50.549 --> 29:53.016
Anal.

29:53.018 --> 29:54.420
- Al.
- Thanks, Deb.

29:57.122 --> 29:59.122
I've heard all this before.

29:59.124 --> 30:01.026
I'm gonna go shed a tear
for Ireland.

30:02.695 --> 30:04.695
It's so good. I'll text it to you.

30:04.697 --> 30:06.764
Hey, I'm gonna go
change into my

30:06.766 --> 30:08.565
special lucky
tournament pants.

30:08.567 --> 30:09.599
Great.

30:12.538 --> 30:15.706
Babe, you okay with playin'
with just your gal pals today?

30:15.708 --> 30:19.476
Oh, honey,
I'll be just great.

30:19.478 --> 30:22.179
Don't you worry about it,
I'm gonna take good care of her.

30:22.181 --> 30:24.281
Thank you, sir.

30:24.283 --> 30:27.184
Okay. All right,
let's get started.

30:27.186 --> 30:29.519
Welcome to our annual
guest invitational.

30:29.521 --> 30:31.621
Your starting holes
are on the board.

30:31.623 --> 30:35.292
If you're 65 or over,
you're welcome to use the gold tees.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.427
Closest to the pins
on four and nine,

30:37.429 --> 30:39.396
you get 50 bucks.
Okay?

30:39.398 --> 30:40.765
And you got a mulligan
on both sides.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.199
Her first marriage
was a mulligan.

30:43.602 --> 30:46.203
And his name was Mulligan.

30:46.205 --> 30:49.139
Okay, so wait for the shotgun.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.141
But most importantly,
have fun.

30:51.143 --> 30:53.109
Whoo!

30:56.783 --> 30:59.583
I would have
put you on my team.

30:59.585 --> 31:01.251
That car stunt
was.

31:01.253 --> 31:05.288
Hm. Where'd you learn
Korean?

31:05.290 --> 31:07.658
Like everyone else.
K-Pop.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.728
All right.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.399
Yeah.
Let's go, kiddo.

31:18.470 --> 31:20.838
What is this?

31:20.840 --> 31:22.341
Your mother
had it delivered.

31:26.679 --> 31:27.747
Move.

31:35.487 --> 31:39.256
All right, we keep
one combined score.

31:39.258 --> 31:41.324
And, uh...

31:41.326 --> 31:44.494
we duplicate the course
because it's only nine holes.

31:44.496 --> 31:46.162
We gotta play it twice,
right?

31:46.164 --> 31:48.733
Uh, one becomes ten,
two becomes 11,

31:48.735 --> 31:50.267
- blah, blah, blah.
- Oh.

31:50.269 --> 31:52.135
- It's a little bizarre.
- Uh-huh.

31:52.137 --> 31:53.804
Like the people.
Makes sense.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.340
Oh, f...!

31:57.342 --> 32:00.277
- Seriously?
- Ah, there you go.

32:00.279 --> 32:03.549
Welcome to your first
tournament. Let's go.

32:04.817 --> 32:07.619
It's your world.
All eyes on you.

32:11.456 --> 32:14.625
You're an athlete.
You're a doctor.

32:14.627 --> 32:15.828
People respect you.

32:17.596 --> 32:18.896
Oh, horrible!

32:18.898 --> 32:20.297
Ah!

32:20.299 --> 32:21.699
Into the cart.

32:21.701 --> 32:23.266
Don't worry.
I'm carrying you.

32:23.268 --> 32:25.870
- Ow!
- Ooh.

32:25.872 --> 32:27.905
Look at these pants.

32:27.907 --> 32:30.540
He's gonna need
all the luck he can get.

32:32.244 --> 32:33.813
You look good.
Masculine.

32:41.286 --> 32:43.721
Oh! That was horrible.

32:47.492 --> 32:50.628
I can't wait to fill
each of you with formaldehyde.

32:50.630 --> 32:51.929
When you're dead.

32:51.931 --> 32:54.364
Maybe you should
relax and breathe.

32:54.366 --> 32:56.801
Shut up,
you little Oriental.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.871
Yeah, I wonder what's
stuck up his ass.

33:00.472 --> 33:02.807
Oh, my God. I think
I just heard his hip break.

33:14.754 --> 33:16.355
Oh, God.
He's having a stroke.

33:27.332 --> 33:28.398
Uh...

33:30.703 --> 33:32.435
You need some drops, Al?

33:32.437 --> 33:34.839
'Cause you can use
the senior tees if you need to.

33:34.841 --> 33:38.341
Oh, man.

33:38.343 --> 33:39.877
Ignore 'em.

33:39.879 --> 33:44.514
Hey, I wish I could
but those pants are loud.

33:44.516 --> 33:45.752
Oh, hold on.

33:47.486 --> 33:49.787
Oh, yeah, don't forget
the tees, weirdo.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.590
You're gonna need those.
What are you doing?

33:53.592 --> 33:55.460
Like, who does that?

34:03.770 --> 34:05.770
Okay, okay.

34:50.348 --> 34:53.552
Oh, God.

35:29.321 --> 35:31.856

Let's get outta here.

38:11.017 --> 38:12.450
Damn,
that was a good shot.

38:14.186 --> 38:15.487
It was very good.

38:17.990 --> 38:21.191
Here, you do it.

38:21.193 --> 38:23.227
We were only one over
on the front,

38:23.229 --> 38:25.095
so you add these up,
you put it here,

38:25.097 --> 38:27.932
put the total,
and you sign it up there.

38:27.934 --> 38:29.135
Yes, sir.

38:46.018 --> 38:49.286
Okay. Third place goes to
ladies club champ Tracy,

38:49.288 --> 38:50.754
and her partner Missy.

38:50.756 --> 38:53.023
- Woo!
- Partner? Nice one.

38:53.025 --> 38:54.692
Hear that, Daddy?

38:54.694 --> 38:57.294
Patrick comes in second
with Randy.

38:57.296 --> 38:59.229
He gets a $50
gift certificate

38:59.231 --> 39:01.801
- to our pro shop.
- All right.

39:02.902 --> 39:05.069
And...

39:05.071 --> 39:06.737
our infamous Al,

39:06.739 --> 39:09.139
in first place again
with his guest Jim.

39:09.141 --> 39:12.211
You win $100 and some balls.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.846
Oh!

39:15.848 --> 39:18.581
And Jimmy gets skins on four
and Tracy on nine.

39:18.583 --> 39:20.017
Hoo!

39:20.019 --> 39:23.654
Hey. That performance
can get you on the team.

39:23.656 --> 39:26.290
If you can cover your fee
and keep your good attitude.

39:26.292 --> 39:29.860
Al and Jim's card
is added up incorrectly.

39:29.862 --> 39:31.195
You gotta be kidding me.

39:31.197 --> 39:33.163
You've gotta tell them.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.968
I love you.

39:37.970 --> 39:40.004
I'm sorry.

39:40.006 --> 39:41.972
Al and Jim are disqualified.

39:41.974 --> 39:43.273
- What?
- Wait.

39:43.275 --> 39:44.942
I just beat
Albatross Al.

39:44.944 --> 39:47.077
I told you I'd carry ya.

39:47.079 --> 39:48.879
But I filled out the card.

39:48.881 --> 39:50.848
Yeah, you filled it out
incorrectly, sweetheart.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.716
I'm sorry,
those are the house rules.

39:52.718 --> 39:54.852
Wow. Way to be
the only Asian in the world

39:54.854 --> 39:57.654
who can't do math.
Nice, dummy.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.089
Amazing.

39:59.091 --> 40:00.224
Patrick and Randy win.

40:00.226 --> 40:01.859
Whoo!

40:01.861 --> 40:02.960
Horse shit.

40:02.962 --> 40:05.062
She still gets the 50

40:05.064 --> 40:07.865
for closest to the pin
on four.

40:35.995 --> 40:38.695
Al, I'm really sorry.

40:38.697 --> 40:39.930
Are you okay?

40:39.932 --> 40:42.900
You play with kids
your own age, okay?

40:42.902 --> 40:44.701
You're really good,
kiddo.

40:44.703 --> 40:45.736
Al, look at me.

40:45.738 --> 40:48.074
No, no, no. No. No!

40:56.048 --> 40:58.215
He's gonna kill himself.

41:18.704 --> 41:20.771
- Ah.
- Goddoggit.

41:20.773 --> 41:22.272
Hey, guys,
can I join you?

41:22.274 --> 41:24.141
Aunt Deb is still working.

41:24.143 --> 41:26.145
Jimmy. Yeah,
come on in.

41:27.379 --> 41:30.214
Great game today.
We all know who won.

41:30.216 --> 41:31.317
Yeah.

41:33.352 --> 41:35.121
Not everyone.

41:37.790 --> 41:40.390
Who you got your eyes on,
Spencer?

41:40.392 --> 41:43.994
No. He likes that
Kathy girl.

41:43.996 --> 41:47.297
Oh, I don't think so.
She's his cousin.

41:49.034 --> 41:50.134
So he might.

41:50.136 --> 41:53.303
Yeah.

41:53.305 --> 41:56.240
Oh, Jimmy.
Just be yourself.

41:56.242 --> 41:58.008
You're awesome.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.410
Tell him he looks good
in his jeans.

42:00.412 --> 42:02.246
And buy him a beer.

42:02.248 --> 42:05.849
I always wanted a girl
to buy me a beer.

42:05.851 --> 42:10.254
Or you can get...
real sensuous with him.

42:10.256 --> 42:12.055
Tell him...

42:12.057 --> 42:14.458
"Oh, you got thick hair."

42:14.460 --> 42:17.261
And then buy him a beer.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.934
Have a beer.

42:23.936 --> 42:25.802
Don't underestimate
us fellas.

42:25.804 --> 42:28.240
We have
complicated emotions.

42:29.942 --> 42:32.075
Just like Al.

42:32.077 --> 42:34.146
He had a great love story.

42:36.348 --> 42:37.948
Yeah.

42:37.950 --> 42:41.852
She's the only reason
he stays here.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.956
I thought his wife
passed away.

42:45.824 --> 42:49.326
He's gonna be buried
right next to her.

42:49.328 --> 42:52.763
He could have been
a pro.

42:52.765 --> 42:55.901
But he stayed local
so he could look after her.

42:56.835 --> 42:59.004
Are you guys married?

43:00.139 --> 43:02.773
The course is our mistress.

43:02.775 --> 43:03.876
Yeah.

43:06.445 --> 43:07.878
Yeah.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.167
You up for
a full 18 today, Doc?

43:30.169 --> 43:33.303
Always.
Just a little slow.

43:33.305 --> 43:36.073
So, what do you think?

43:36.075 --> 43:37.407
What, a nine?

43:37.409 --> 43:39.276
Nine for me,
pitching wedge for you.

43:39.278 --> 43:40.811
Hm.

43:40.813 --> 43:42.546
Maybe I need
a new prescription.

43:42.548 --> 43:45.582
I told you that last
week when you flew the green.

43:56.962 --> 43:58.395
Here.

43:58.397 --> 44:00.998
Hey, have you guys, um...
have you guys seen Al?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.200
I think he played earlier.

44:03.202 --> 44:05.135
Maybe he's at
his office.

44:05.137 --> 44:07.004
Do you want any water?

44:22.888 --> 44:24.855
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Al.

44:24.857 --> 44:26.390
Oh, he didn't come in today.

44:26.392 --> 44:28.592
Oh. Why isn't he in?

44:28.594 --> 44:30.427
He's old.
I don't know.

44:30.429 --> 44:33.330
Okay, well, thanks.

44:33.332 --> 44:35.332
Do you need your eyes checked
or something?

44:35.334 --> 44:37.301
No, just looking for Al.

44:37.303 --> 44:38.470
Okay.

44:40.973 --> 44:43.909
Here. Try my putter.
Yours sucks.

44:47.313 --> 44:50.580
Al. You okay?

44:50.582 --> 44:54.051
Yeah, I feel terrific.
I'm ready to join the NFL.

44:54.053 --> 44:55.585
It's spreading.
You need to rest.

44:55.587 --> 44:57.387
Okay? At least
no more tournaments.

44:57.389 --> 45:00.490
No, I'm gonna
surprise Jim next week.

45:00.492 --> 45:03.193
You haven't told her.

45:03.195 --> 45:05.962
No point to.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.998
Don't let her get
too attached.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.566
Yeah.

45:09.568 --> 45:11.301
Come on, you make a putt
for a change.

45:11.303 --> 45:12.604
I'm tired of
carrying your ass.

45:17.176 --> 45:19.345
Oh, hell no.

45:21.413 --> 45:23.349
Oh, sh... fu....

45:40.966 --> 45:43.535
Okay, Patrick.

45:56.281 --> 45:57.349
Ooh.

45:59.585 --> 46:01.451
Where you going?

46:01.453 --> 46:04.354

a happy ending.

47:57.169 --> 47:58.568
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

47:58.570 --> 48:01.505
Everyone's good.
Hey, girls.

48:01.507 --> 48:03.774
Happy father-daughter day,
everybody.

48:03.776 --> 48:06.610
It's captain and mate today,
so no pressure.

48:06.612 --> 48:08.278
Everybody wins.

48:08.280 --> 48:10.616
Because every girl
has a dad. Am I right?

48:13.485 --> 48:16.086
I'm covering her
membership fee.

48:16.088 --> 48:19.322
I'm a little short for
the team fee.

48:19.324 --> 48:22.827
She's gonna make a great
addition to the high school team.

48:22.829 --> 48:25.863
Thank you.

48:27.767 --> 48:30.467
How you doin', Deb?

48:30.469 --> 48:33.804
You know, it's a hard day
for a few of us.

48:33.806 --> 48:35.305
Which is harder,

48:35.307 --> 48:37.042
Valentine's Day or
Father's Day?

48:40.212 --> 48:41.346
Mother's Day.

48:43.515 --> 48:45.448
Whoa.

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

49:15.547 --> 49:16.747
Hey, guys.

49:16.749 --> 49:19.583
How was your
father-daughter d...

49:19.585 --> 49:22.519
Oh, shit.

49:22.521 --> 49:24.454
So, your mom was
Asian, right?

49:24.456 --> 49:26.724
Was she a good cook?

49:26.726 --> 49:29.526
No, sh... she was
too busy for me.

49:29.528 --> 49:31.796
Oh.

49:31.798 --> 49:33.330
Worked a lot, huh?

49:33.332 --> 49:34.466
She was a prostitute.

49:38.738 --> 49:41.106
You gotta find
your own tribe, Jimmy.

49:41.741 --> 49:43.241
Yeah.

49:44.777 --> 49:47.510
Always ask yourself,

49:47.512 --> 49:50.347
"Would I play golf with 'em?"

49:50.349 --> 49:51.581
Yeah.

49:51.583 --> 49:53.516
Yeah.

50:00.627 --> 50:02.629
Why didn't you get it
checked sooner, Dad?

50:03.730 --> 50:04.862
Would have
interfered with...

50:04.864 --> 50:06.198
Your golf game.

50:08.367 --> 50:10.500
You'd rather die than
miss a day to play.

50:10.502 --> 50:12.870
Well...

50:12.872 --> 50:14.139
I know.

50:16.408 --> 50:18.375
I grew up with it.

50:18.377 --> 50:21.277
Yeah, I never saw anyone
play so many rounds of golf

50:21.279 --> 50:23.446
and stay so bad.

50:23.448 --> 50:26.449
Yeah, well, you weren't
that good of a teacher, Dad.

50:26.451 --> 50:28.886
Ah, <i>touché.</i>

50:32.892 --> 50:35.926
I'm just glad you...
you found something,

50:35.928 --> 50:38.363
a place where you belong,
you know?

50:39.999 --> 50:42.234
I hope you find
that place too, son.

50:44.737 --> 50:46.171
Me, too.

50:56.515 --> 51:00.017
Uh, there's a few things I want
to talk to you about tonight

51:00.019 --> 51:02.285
before dinner, okay?

51:02.287 --> 51:03.321
Okay.

51:07.559 --> 51:08.828
Hit 'em straight.

51:17.904 --> 51:19.939
- Oh, hey, Jim.
- Yep.

51:21.473 --> 51:24.441
Hey.

51:24.443 --> 51:26.543
Oh, my gosh,
I love this song.

51:26.545 --> 51:28.646
- You know them?
- Yeah, I love these guys.

51:28.648 --> 51:31.581
I mean, we're not all from
"Pennsyltucky," so...

51:31.583 --> 51:33.485
I know the dance.
Watch me.

51:39.859 --> 51:41.291
Yeah.

51:45.363 --> 51:46.897
So, Spencer,

51:46.899 --> 51:49.867
you look really good
in your pants.

51:49.869 --> 51:52.435
I look really good in
my hair, too. I know.

51:52.437 --> 51:54.071
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

51:54.073 --> 51:55.438
Hold on.

52:14.459 --> 52:15.527
Whew.

52:17.562 --> 52:18.765
Ahh.

52:26.438 --> 52:27.506
So...

52:31.778 --> 52:34.346
Oh! Man,
that's a worm burner.

52:35.748 --> 52:36.916
Cool.

52:40.987 --> 52:42.385
Deb.

52:42.387 --> 52:44.454
Hey, Doc.

52:44.456 --> 52:46.456
Where you been?

52:46.458 --> 52:47.625
Ah, you don't
want to know.

52:47.627 --> 52:49.093
Let me have a drink.

52:49.095 --> 52:52.397
- One Arnold Palmer.
- No, no, a regular drink.

52:53.565 --> 52:54.765
What would you have?

52:54.767 --> 52:57.802
With a face like that...

52:57.804 --> 52:59.036
whiskey.

52:59.038 --> 53:00.603
I'll have two.

53:00.605 --> 53:02.909
Make it three.
I don't want to drink alone.

53:21.861 --> 53:24.664
Uh... she's not ready for
the up and down.

53:27.465 --> 53:29.399
Here's to you, Doc.

53:29.401 --> 53:30.468
Yeah.

53:33.538 --> 53:35.840
Oh...

53:35.842 --> 53:37.977
- Jim.
- I got it, I got it.

53:40.780 --> 53:43.413
Hey, kiddo.

53:43.415 --> 53:44.416
How you doin'?

53:45.918 --> 53:47.751
I'm fine, sir.

53:47.753 --> 53:52.122
I think I just went
a little too far too fast.

53:52.124 --> 53:53.858
With Spencer?

53:53.860 --> 53:55.995
Oh, no, no.
With Bud.

53:56.896 --> 53:59.529
Well, you should get to
know each other first.

53:59.531 --> 54:00.867
I just met Jack.

54:04.070 --> 54:06.973
Jim.
Have you been drinking?

54:07.907 --> 54:11.574
Why are you dressed like
you're going to a funeral?

54:11.576 --> 54:14.144
I'm practicing.

54:14.146 --> 54:15.547
Oh...

54:18.050 --> 54:18.885
Honey.

54:21.486 --> 54:25.825
Deb, get me
a couple of waters, will ya?

54:34.033 --> 54:35.101
Hey.

54:40.605 --> 54:42.538
You don't look so good.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.476
I'm old.
Leave me alone.

54:47.146 --> 54:48.779
You missed playing
yesterday.

54:48.781 --> 54:51.616
Mm, I had an offer
to play Tall Pines.

54:52.251 --> 54:54.118
And today?

54:54.120 --> 54:55.819
I was out there
early this morning,

54:55.821 --> 54:57.489
and I didn't see you.

55:00.860 --> 55:03.593
My bike got stolen.

55:03.595 --> 55:06.165
Oh. That sucks.

55:08.200 --> 55:11.635
But I hit a 250 yard drive
on seven.

55:13.205 --> 55:15.708
Does that make you
a "michelin sockie"?

55:17.509 --> 55:19.076
Are you trying to say
"michensake"?

55:20.947 --> 55:22.014
<i>L'chaim.</i>

55:23.049 --> 55:24.882
What's that mean?

55:24.884 --> 55:26.719
- To life.
- Oh.

55:31.924 --> 55:34.459
Our team is playing
a tournament tomorrow.

55:35.094 --> 55:37.995
Oh. <i>Mazel tov.</i>

55:37.997 --> 55:41.932
That means congratulations
and good luck.

55:41.934 --> 55:43.934
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

55:43.936 --> 55:46.536
Be my caddy?

55:46.538 --> 55:48.305
Screw that?

55:48.307 --> 55:49.907
I'll come out,
watch you play,

55:49.909 --> 55:51.942
give you some pointers.

55:51.944 --> 55:53.779
And believe me,
you need 'em.

55:57.917 --> 55:59.251
So do you.

56:03.089 --> 56:04.489
Wise ass.

56:28.914 --> 56:31.884
Put that butt out.
There you go.

56:33.019 --> 56:35.652
Hey, guys, um,
have you seen Al?

56:35.654 --> 56:37.321
Uh-uh.

56:37.323 --> 56:39.089
I got a sandwich.

56:41.027 --> 56:42.059
Come on, let me in,
let me in.

56:42.061 --> 56:43.327
Oh, hey.

56:43.329 --> 56:45.896
Hey. Heard you
puked on Spencer.

56:45.898 --> 56:47.765
Uh, yeah.

56:47.767 --> 56:49.133
I've always
wanted to do that.

56:49.135 --> 56:50.801
Me, too.

56:50.803 --> 56:52.736
You're just mad he's
a better putter than you.

56:52.738 --> 56:54.938
Where is Spencer?

56:54.940 --> 56:57.107
He wanted to sleep in
instead of play.

56:57.109 --> 56:58.742
And miss a tournament?

56:58.744 --> 57:00.911
- Priorities.
- All right, guys, come on.

57:00.913 --> 57:02.346
See us winning.

57:02.348 --> 57:05.983
See our birdies.
All our birdies.

57:05.985 --> 57:08.187
All right?
We got this.

57:21.300 --> 57:22.635
That was good.

57:29.642 --> 57:30.709
Wow!

57:33.012 --> 57:34.747
This is Dr. Swat.
What is it?

57:36.348 --> 57:37.615
When?

57:38.350 --> 57:39.750
I'll be right there.

57:39.752 --> 57:41.151
I'm sorry, guys.
I gotta go.

57:41.153 --> 57:42.354
Save a life, doc.

57:45.091 --> 57:47.927
Okay.

57:56.669 --> 57:58.102
Shake it off,
shake it off.

57:58.104 --> 58:00.070
Come on, Jim.

58:00.072 --> 58:01.207
Show 'em
what you got, baby.

58:07.813 --> 58:09.048
Come on, Jim.

58:12.184 --> 58:13.784
Don't worry.
I got this.

58:13.786 --> 58:16.120
Loosey goose.

58:32.037 --> 58:33.305
Boom.

58:38.878 --> 58:42.279
I'm still here.
When's tee time?

58:42.281 --> 58:44.348
Well, your lung collapsed.

58:44.350 --> 58:47.184
And the cancer's
spread to your liver.

58:47.186 --> 58:49.019
Can I go home now?

58:49.021 --> 58:50.821
You're covered for
in-home hospice care,

58:50.823 --> 58:53.257
but I'd recommend that you
stay at the one in town.

58:53.259 --> 58:54.994
Too far from the course.

58:56.829 --> 58:58.428
You're an idiot.
You know that?

58:58.430 --> 59:00.864
Been called worse.

59:00.866 --> 59:02.835
But I can't pronounce it.

59:06.438 --> 59:08.207
It's been fun
playing with you.

59:09.341 --> 59:11.441
You're still not getting
my cart.

59:11.443 --> 59:13.010
But I'm keeping
the putter.

59:13.012 --> 59:14.947
It won't help.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.517
Hello, Dr. Wiserman.
I'm Sally.

01:00:27.519 --> 01:00:29.488
I'm your in-home care nurse.

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.423

01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:24.528

I'm Al's son, Eric.

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:30.162
Al never told me
he had a son.

01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:35.565
I'm Debra.
From the club.

01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:37.668
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.605
Is he alive?

01:04:41.206 --> 01:04:42.608
He has ocular cancer.

01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:46.111
It's spread to his
liver and lungs.

01:04:49.281 --> 01:04:51.450
They gave him three months
to live three months ago.

01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:55.220
Can I go see him?

01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:58.323
Please.

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:16.141
Hey, kiddo. Here.

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:22.579
No.

01:05:22.581 --> 01:05:27.250
What? Did you put an iron
through somebody's head?

01:05:27.252 --> 01:05:28.721
Almost.

01:05:30.757 --> 01:05:33.858
So, what's wrong with you?

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.295
Besides being old and fat.

01:05:38.765 --> 01:05:42.601
We only borrow this game,
kiddo, we don't own it.

01:05:46.305 --> 01:05:48.641
Ahh, give me a break.

01:05:49.742 --> 01:05:51.243
Don't start that.

01:05:54.246 --> 01:05:56.179

01:05:56.181 --> 01:05:57.380
Jim.

01:05:57.382 --> 01:06:00.185
No, she's got her
priorities right.

01:06:02.387 --> 01:06:05.725
No, I didn't
make it today, kiddo.

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:09.729
I think his golf days
are over now.

01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:30.413
Hey.

01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:58.343
Ahhh...

01:07:10.222 --> 01:07:13.525
Pearl, at least you died
with a smile on your face.

01:07:42.554 --> 01:07:45.255
Congratulations, boss.

01:07:45.257 --> 01:07:49.492
Now, how are we gonna pay
the boobs... bills?

01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:54.597
- Hi, there.
- Hey, uh, can Al come out and play?

01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:55.866
He should really rest.

01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:58.035
Hey, kiddo.

01:07:58.037 --> 01:08:00.270
Get lost.

01:08:00.272 --> 01:08:02.305

01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:05.442

in three days.

01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:07.446
I know and it's killin' me.

01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:10.547

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:12.348

01:08:22.694 --> 01:08:25.029

- Oh, my gosh.

Jesus, don't scare me
like that.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:56.526

resting my eyes.

and we sold a lot of
golf balls, too.

01:23:48.921 --> 01:23:50.788
