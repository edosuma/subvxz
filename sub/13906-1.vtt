00:04.011 --> 00:06.007
and everything nice --

These were
the ingredients chosen

00:08.006 --> 00:10.006
to create
the perfect little girl.

00:10.008 --> 00:12.017
But Professor Utonium
accidentally added

00:12.019 --> 00:14.021
an extra ingredient
to the concoction --

Oh, sorry.

01:21.008 --> 01:23.010
The city
of Townsville --

01:23.012 --> 01:25.007
A city that sleeps,

01:25.009 --> 01:29.013
a tired town
with an early, early bedtime.

01:29.015 --> 01:31.012
No need

Did you search
for any clues, curator?

02:44.006 --> 02:46.006
Well, I didn't want
these brutish police

02:46.008 --> 02:47.025
trouncing around
my beautiful museum.

02:47.027 --> 02:52.005
That's silly.
Ok, girls, spread and search.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.028
Hi! What's
your name?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.012
Miss Goodelady --
Miss Ima Goodelady.

13:44.014 --> 13:46.002
We're The Powerpuff Girls!

13:46.004 --> 13:50.019
Oh, I know exactly who you three
wonderful girls are,

13:50.021 --> 13:54.016
but who is that strapping
gentleman behind you?

13:54.018 --> 13:57.008
I -- I -- I -- I -- I...

13:57.010 --> 13:58.011
He's the Professor.

13:58.013 --> 14:00.011
He's single.
Bubbles!

14:00.013 --> 14:02.015
What they mean to say is perhaps
if you're not too busy,

14:02.017 --> 14:04.004
maybe he could
take you out.

14:04.006 --> 14:05.028
Why, that would
be splendid.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.014
Saturday night then?

14:07.016 --> 14:08.019
No, Sunday!

14:08.021 --> 14:09.025
I like Friday!

14:09.027 --> 14:11.006
Friday it is.

14:11.008 --> 14:12.011
Say, 8:00?

14:12.013 --> 14:13.015
No, 10:00.

14:13.017 --> 14:14.018
I like 7:00!

14:14.020 --> 14:16.009
7:00 sounds great.

14:16.011 --> 14:18.024
Yay! Friday at 7:00!

14:18.026 --> 14:20.003
Well, see you then...

14:20.005 --> 14:23.015
And of course,
you, too, Professor.

14:23.017 --> 14:25.002
I -- I -- I -- I...

14:25.004 --> 14:29.018
Narrator: Boy, that professor
is one smooth operator.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.029
The big night!

14:31.001 --> 14:32.022
I found
your bow!

14:32.024 --> 14:35.004
Oh, it looks
so lovely.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.017
Bubbles,
it's a bow tie,

14:36.019 --> 14:38.005
and it goes
down here, see?

14:38.007 --> 14:40.018
Oh. I guess that
looks good, too.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.011
And your hair gel.
And cologne.

14:42.013 --> 14:43.023
Breath mints.
And cuff links.

14:43.025 --> 14:46.002
And some of these.
And don't forget
the flower.

14:46.004 --> 14:48.011
Narrator: Looking sharp,
Professor.

14:48.013 --> 14:51.028
And speaking of sharp,
it's almost 7:00 sharp!

14:52.000 --> 14:53.016
I won't be late, girls,

14:53.018 --> 14:55.029
and, mayor, thanks again
for baby-sitting.

14:56.001 --> 14:59.008
Good-bye, Professor!
Have fun!

15:04.021 --> 15:07.013
[Snoring and mumbling
sleepily]

15:07.015 --> 15:10.020
Mayor, I'm back.
You can go home now.

15:10.022 --> 15:12.018
Aah! My life
is a lie!

15:12.020 --> 15:15.009
[Stammering]
Oh! Uh, ahem.

15:15.011 --> 15:17.001
Uh, good night!

15:17.003 --> 15:19.007
[Static]

15:22.013 --> 15:26.011
Wake up, girls.
I have a surprise for you.

15:26.013 --> 15:28.022
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

15:31.001 --> 15:33.019
I'm so excited to be
helping out around here

15:33.021 --> 15:35.002
with you girls.

15:35.004 --> 15:36.019
Helping out?!

15:36.021 --> 15:37.014
With what?

15:37.016 --> 15:38.016
Well, girls --

15:38.018 --> 15:40.021
Why don't you let me
explain to them?

15:40.023 --> 15:43.003
Oh, ok, uh, sure.

15:43.005 --> 15:44.003
Alone.

15:44.005 --> 15:46.025
I'm at your command,
Ima. Ha ha!

15:46.027 --> 15:48.017
Ha ha ha!
Oh, you.

15:48.019 --> 15:50.025
You see, it's
quite simple, girls.

15:50.027 --> 15:53.013
With the Professor
being as busy as he is,

15:53.015 --> 15:55.017
it will be good to have
a female touch

15:55.019 --> 15:56.027
helping out around here.

15:56.029 --> 15:59.005
But we don't need
any extra help around here.

15:59.007 --> 15:59.026
We're...

15:59.028 --> 16:01.026
The Powerpuff Girls!

16:01.028 --> 16:03.028
Ha ha ha!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.015
And it is
<i>that</i><i>kind of attitude</i>

16:05.017 --> 16:07.013
that is going to change
around here!

16:07.015 --> 16:09.019
Narrator: Uh-oh.
Something is amiss,

16:09.021 --> 16:11.008
or maybe even soon...

16:11.010 --> 16:12.029
a missus!
The next morning...

16:13.001 --> 16:15.015
Come on, girls!
Townsville's in trouble!

16:15.017 --> 16:18.006
And just where do you think
you're going?

16:18.008 --> 16:19.027
We're going to
fight crime!

16:19.029 --> 16:21.007
That's what we do.
Duh!

16:21.009 --> 16:22.015
Not today you don't.

16:22.017 --> 16:24.001
You three left
the living room

16:24.003 --> 16:25.009
a complete mess
last night,

16:25.011 --> 16:27.023
and there will be
no crime-fighting

16:27.025 --> 16:29.021
until that room
is spotless!

16:29.023 --> 16:31.011
No problem.

16:32.013 --> 16:33.016
Done.

16:33.018 --> 16:35.004
Fine, just fine...

16:35.006 --> 16:37.011
But I'm afraid
you forgot...

16:37.013 --> 16:39.001
this! And this!

16:39.003 --> 16:41.001
And this and this
and this!

16:41.003 --> 16:45.015
From now on, you are forbidden
to use your superpowers!

16:45.017 --> 16:48.015
You will do things
like normal little girls!

16:48.017 --> 16:50.023
Narrator:
And so The Powerpuff Girls

16:50.025 --> 16:53.011
cleaned the room
like normal kids.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.014
Boring.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.009
Oh, girls!
It's time for...

17:00.011 --> 17:01.027
Ima: Bed!

17:01.029 --> 17:03.017
Uh, what? Bed?

17:03.019 --> 17:06.009
Well, honey, they are
growing girls,

17:06.011 --> 17:09.001
and growing girls do
need their rest...

17:09.003 --> 17:09.027
don't they?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.003
Well, I -- I -- I --

17:11.005 --> 17:12.017
But, Professor!

17:12.019 --> 17:14.000
Well, if Ima thinks
it's time for bed,

17:14.002 --> 17:17.003
then I'll have to
agree with her.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.008
And growing girls don't
play with stupid dolls!

17:29.008 --> 17:32.028
Now, good night.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.010
Buttercup:
This stinks.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.017
Bubbles:
It's too dark.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.011
Blossom: There's something
fishy about that --

17:37.013 --> 17:41.001
Never mind that for now.
The city needs us!

17:41.003 --> 17:43.008
Narrator:
That's more like it!

17:43.010 --> 17:45.013
And so after a tiring evening
of crime-fighting,

17:45.015 --> 17:48.010
the girls
quietly return home.

17:48.012 --> 17:52.004
Ima: And just where
have you three been?

17:53.024 --> 17:55.004
Well?!

17:55.006 --> 17:56.029
We were out
fighting crime!

17:57.001 --> 17:59.003
That's what we do.
Duh.

18:00.017 --> 18:05.007
That's it!
You three are grounded!

18:05.009 --> 18:08.028
[Yawning]
What's going on down here?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.011
Oh, Professor,
I was so worried!

18:12.013 --> 18:14.017
I went to check
on the girls,

18:14.019 --> 18:16.010
and they weren't
in bed,

18:16.012 --> 18:18.011
so I waited and waited.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.006
Oh! I was so worried.

18:21.008 --> 18:24.025
They purposely
disrespected me

18:24.027 --> 18:27.012
and left to fight crime.

18:27.014 --> 18:30.011
Oh, I just want
to be good to them,

18:30.013 --> 18:33.026
so I punished them.

18:33.028 --> 18:38.008
I just -- I just --
oh...

18:39.004 --> 18:40.029
Girls, she's
only looking out

18:41.001 --> 18:42.015
for your best interest.

18:42.017 --> 18:43.017
But -- But -- But --

18:43.019 --> 18:48.025
No buts.
You're g-g-grounded.

18:53.013 --> 18:55.026
Narrator:
The Powerpuff Girls grounded?

18:55.028 --> 18:57.022
How can this be?

18:57.024 --> 18:59.019
What kind of crimes
will go unpunished?

18:59.021 --> 19:02.002
What evil will befall
Townsville?

19:02.004 --> 19:04.024
And just where the heck
is she off to?

19:04.026 --> 19:06.011
[Ringing]

19:06.013 --> 19:07.011
Hello.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.005
Mayor: Blossom,
it's the Mayor.

19:09.007 --> 19:11.000
Oh, hello, Mayor.

19:11.002 --> 19:13.018
Blossom, I need your
help right away.

19:13.020 --> 19:16.006
Sorry, Mayor,
but we're grounded.

19:16.008 --> 19:18.004
Well, you picked
a fine night

19:18.006 --> 19:19.012
to be grounded.

19:19.014 --> 19:21.013
Sedusa is
robbing my safe

19:21.015 --> 19:23.000
of its jewels
as we speak.

19:23.002 --> 19:24.027
Hey, put those back!

19:24.029 --> 19:26.001
Sedusa?!

19:26.003 --> 19:28.006
Yes, that <i>is</i>
quite a coincidence

19:28.008 --> 19:29.019
we got grounded.

19:29.021 --> 19:31.027
Don't worry, Mayor.
We'll catch Sedusa...

19:31.029 --> 19:35.010
as soon as
she gets home.

19:37.005 --> 19:39.024
Blossom: And just where
have you been?

19:39.026 --> 19:43.005
Well,
Miss Goodelady?

19:43.007 --> 19:45.021
I thought I grounded
you brats!

19:45.023 --> 19:46.024
I'm getting
the Professor.

19:46.026 --> 19:51.004
Afraid not, Ima.
He's conveniently stepped out.

19:51.006 --> 19:54.004
And we know you're not
such a good lady after all.

19:54.006 --> 19:56.021
What's in the bag,
Sedusa?

19:56.023 --> 19:59.028
Narrator: Sedusa?!
Who would have guessed it?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.028
Let go!

20:02.001 --> 20:05.006
Well, what do you know?
The Mayor's jewels.

20:05.008 --> 20:08.028
Nice try, Sedusa,
but the game's over.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.010
Ha ha! Never.

20:10.012 --> 20:14.010
I'll just sweet-talk that
sap
of a professor.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.003
He'll believe me...

20:16.005 --> 20:18.005
And you three
bug-eyed creeps

20:18.007 --> 20:21.008
will be grounded
forever! Ha ha ha!

20:23.009 --> 20:25.019
Ground this!

20:33.025 --> 20:37.017
Oh, girls, I'm back
from the <i>store?!</i>

20:37.019 --> 20:39.022
What's going on here?

20:39.024 --> 20:42.015
Oh, Professor, honey,
thank goodness you're back.

20:42.017 --> 20:46.020
The girls just went crazy and
jumped me when I came home.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.023
No, Professor,
it's not true.

20:48.025 --> 20:50.019
She's really
Sedusa.

20:50.021 --> 20:52.015
And she grounded us
so she could make off

20:52.017 --> 20:54.005
with the Mayor's jewels.

20:54.007 --> 20:55.021
Liars!

20:55.023 --> 20:57.023
Professor, sweetie,

20:57.025 --> 20:59.021
you believe me,
don't you?

20:59.023 --> 21:01.024
Please...

21:01.026 --> 21:03.028
Help me.

21:07.001 --> 21:09.028
Please.

21:13.027 --> 21:15.019
[Gasp]

21:16.023 --> 21:18.015
Professor: Girls,
call the police.

21:18.017 --> 21:21.008
This crook isn't going to
deceive us anymore.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.012
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

21:22.014 --> 21:24.007
Narrator: Well,
it looks like things

21:24.009 --> 21:26.024
are back to normal
at the Powerpuff household.

21:26.026 --> 21:28.021
[Doorbell rings]

21:28.023 --> 21:32.009
Hello. Can I --
[Stammering]

21:34.009 --> 21:36.009
Hello. I live
down the street,

21:36.011 --> 21:38.012
and I heard all about
your apprehension

21:38.014 --> 21:39.028
of that vicious
criminal,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.014
and so I baked you
a pie.

21:42.016 --> 21:44.018
[Stammering]

21:44.020 --> 21:47.001
Narrator: Uh-oh!
Here we go again!

21:47.003 --> 21:49.029
Better nip this one
in the bud, girls.

21:50.001 --> 21:53.017
And so once again
the day is saved,
