09:26.983 --> 09:29.777
- LISTEN, BOB AND I--
WE'RE NOT ENGAGED,

09:29.860 --> 09:31.487
AND WE'RE NOT A COUPLE.

09:31.570 --> 09:36.117
AND SORRY TO DISAPPOINT,
BUT WE NEVER WILL BE.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.493
OH, LOOK.

09:37.576 --> 09:38.536
THEY'VE TAKEN THE NEWS
QUITE WELL.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.496
THEY DON'T SEEM UPSET AT ALL.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.332
- MY PARENTS ARE DEAF, JOY.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.667
THEY DON'T READ LIPS.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.627
THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD YOU JUST SAID.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.381
- YEAH, UH-HUH.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.882
- WHAT'S HE SAYING?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.342
- HE SAYS HE CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REAL.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.012
HE WAS SURE I'D MADE YOU UP.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.639
- WELL, I'VE SEEN SIGN LANGUAGE
BEFORE, AND THAT DIDN'T LOOK--

09:58.723 --> 10:01.183
- OH, WE DON'T USE
STANDARD SIGN LANGUAGE

10:01.267 --> 10:04.854
BECAUSE, WELL, I NEVER REALLY
GOT THE HANG OF IT.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.857
IT'S HARD.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.233
- NO. NO, MOM.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.945
I DON'T THINK SHE'S TOO OLD.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.866
- BOB, YOUR PARENTS
AREN'T VERY NICE.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.534
- OH, AND YOU JUST ASSUMED
THEY'D BE NICE

10:18.617 --> 10:21.245
BECAUSE THEY'RE DEAF.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.874
- NO,
BECAUSE THEY'RE CANADIAN.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.043
- WELL, IF YOU THINK
THEY'RE MEAN HERE,

10:27.126 --> 10:28.669
YOU SHOULD SEE
WHAT COMES OUT OF THEIR HANDS

10:28.753 --> 10:31.172
WHEN WE'RE AT HOME.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.926
- OH, YOU POOR THING.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.306
JUST TELL THEM THAT
I CARE FOR THEIR SON VERY MUCH.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.849
- JOY, THEY'RE DEAF.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.059
IF WE REALLY WANT
TO CONVINCE THEM,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.353
I'M AFRAID THEY'LL HAVE TO

10:45.436 --> 10:47.188
READ OUR LIPS.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.400
- OH, FINE.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.746
- MOM SAYS--
- YEAH. YEAH.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.915
I KNOW WHAT THAT ONE MEANS.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.212
- AH.
HOLD ON.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.172
QUICK SHOT.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.260
I'M POSTING THIS ON TWITTER.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.098
#IVEBEENINHERMOUTHALLMORNING.

11:22.181 --> 11:26.185
- BECAUSE HE'S MY DENTIST.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.981
SO WHAT IS IT YOU DO, LUKE?

11:31.065 --> 11:36.237
- OH,
LIVE, LEARN, LOVE.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.574
I'M A BIT
OF A RENAISSANCE MAN.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.619
RENAISSANCE FAIRE MAN.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.079
ELKA AND I ROLE-PLAY.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.957
SHE'S THE VILLAGE MILKMAID.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.923
- MY MILK CHURNS BRING
ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.928
- DID YOU PATCH THINGS UP
WITH EMMY?

12:01.011 --> 12:03.639
- NO, I MADE IT WORSE.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.142
SHE'S PACKING
AND BOOKING A FLIGHT HOME,

12:06.225 --> 12:08.144
AND THE HARDEST PART IS,
I KNOW HER.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.479
SHE'LL BE MISERABLE
IF SHE GIVES UP ACTING.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.815
- THAT IS THE TOUGH PART
ABOUT HAVING ADULT CHILDREN.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.443
YOU HAVE TO LET THEM MAKE
THEIR OWN CHOICES AND MISTAKES.

12:15.526 --> 12:19.238
- YOU KNOW,
AS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE, UM...

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO WEIGH IN HERE.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.661
UM, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDFATHER WAS CRITICAL

12:25.744 --> 12:27.830
OF THE WAY MY MOM
WAS LIVING HER LIFE,

12:27.913 --> 12:31.000
SO SHE NEVER LET ME SEE HIM,
AND I NEVER GOT TO KNOW HIM.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.711
- ELKA'S LOVER IS RIGHT.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.007
I WANT TO SEE MY GRANDCHILD.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.551
I WANT TO BE
A PART OF EMMY'S LIFE.

12:40.634 --> 12:45.389
SO I'VE JUST GOT TO APOLOGIZE
AND KEEP MY OPINIONS TO MYSELF.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.766
- OH, WELL, SOMETIMES
A LITTLE FIGHTING

12:47.850 --> 12:50.144
CAN BE A POSITIVE THING
IN A RELATIONSHIP TOO.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.645
ELKA AND I HAVE GONE
A FEW ROUNDS,

12:51.729 --> 12:54.273
HAVEN'T WE, BABE?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.525
BUT THEN AGAIN,
THINGS ARE BOUND TO TURN HOT

12:56.609 --> 13:01.071
WHEN FIRE MEETS FIRE.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.664
- YOU SURE YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR OPINIONS

13:10.748 --> 13:11.874
TO YOURSELF, VICTORIA?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.211
- I'M DOING IT NOW.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.717
OH, MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.928
SO PLUMP WITH CHILD.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.679
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU STAYED IN CLEVELAND

13:25.763 --> 13:26.931
TO BE WITH ME
ON MY BIG NIGHT.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.140
- I'M GLAD WE MADE UP.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.893
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT
YOU AGREED WITH ALL MY CHOICES.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.937
- WELL, IT'S EASY
WHEN YOUR CHOICES ARE SO GREAT

13:33.020 --> 13:37.191
AND CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.735
- INSTAGRAM TIME, PEOPLE.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.819
I'M GONNA TWEET THIS PHOTO.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.738
HEY, HOW ABOUT A RETWEET

13:42.821 --> 13:44.740
FOR CLEVELAND'S
MOST INTERACTIVE DENTIST

13:44.823 --> 13:48.369
FROM THE STAR OF <i> COLESLAW?</i>

13:48.452 --> 13:52.248
- IT'S <i> COLE'S LAW.</i>

13:52.331 --> 13:54.708
- WHAT DID I SAY?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.585
- AND I CLOSED MY ACCOUNT NOW
THAT I'M HAVING THE WRITERS

13:56.669 --> 13:57.753
KILL OFF MY CHARACTER.

13:57.836 --> 13:58.754
- WHAT?

13:58.837 --> 14:00.422
BUT, DARLING,

14:00.506 --> 14:02.132
IF THEY KILL OFF YOUR CHARACTER,
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.592
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.761
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T REALLY
BE A GOOD MOM AND KEEP ACTING.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.388
- OH, I KEPT ACTING.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.473
- YES, YOU DID.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.980
- WOW, A LOT OF UNRESOLVED
PARENT-CHILD ISSUES THERE,

14:16.063 --> 14:18.440
EH, JOY TOY?

14:18.524 --> 14:19.775
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.944
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
PRETENDING TO HAVE A FIANCEE

14:22.027 --> 14:23.445
TO PLEASE
HIS MEAN, DEAF PARENTS?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.574
BE A MAN AND STAND UP TO THEM.
- I'VE TRIED.

14:26.657 --> 14:30.995
I JUST CAN NEVER FIND
THE RIGHT GESTURES.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.414
- YES,
I WAS A WORKING MOTHER,

14:33.497 --> 14:36.125
WORKING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH ANYTHING YOU WANTED.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.793
WHAT, YOU THINK
ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN

14:37.876 --> 14:40.671
HAD MANDY PATINKIN COME
TO THEIR SIXTH BIRTHDAY PARTY?

14:40.754 --> 14:43.299
- I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS,
AND I WANTED URKEL.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.385
- I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.511
- DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:47.595 --> 14:49.513
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A MOTHER LIKE YOU.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.556
- TAKE THAT BACK.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.766
- I WON'T.
- FINE.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.810
A DRAMATIC PAUSE THEN.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.438
- PUNCTUATED
BY AN ANGRY SIGH.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.191
[both sigh angrily]

15:01.275 --> 15:04.320
- I'M SENSING
KIND OF A BAD VIBE HERE.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.946
MAYBE A DRINK WOULD HELP?

15:06.030 --> 15:06.989
CAN I FRESHEN THAT FOR YOU,
BABE?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.490
- I'M GOOD, LOVER.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.950
- OKAY.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.827
- #CONFUSED.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.330
WHAT EXACTLY
IS YOUR GUYS' DEAL?

15:14.413 --> 15:17.666
- THERE'S NO DEAL, MAN.
WE JUST ENJOY EACH OTHER.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.002
- OUR SOULS TOUCH.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.963
- AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
- [giggles]

15:23.047 --> 15:24.673
- OH, I FEEL SICK.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.217
- WE ALL DO, HONEY.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.178
- IT'S NOT THAT.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.346
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.347
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.598
- EMMY.
- EMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.896
- SOMETHING'S HAPPENING?
- YES.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.607
MELON IS TELLING ME THAT
HE OR SHE WANTS TO COME OUT.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.859
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
MELON DOESN'T WANT THAT.

15:43.942 --> 15:44.943
WHAT'S THAT, MELON?

15:45.027 --> 15:49.406
OH, YOU WANT THE RED CARPET
TO GO ON AS SCHEDULED?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.450
YOU CAN DO THIS, EMMY.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.535
NOW, I WENT INTO LABOR
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOT TUB

15:53.619 --> 15:56.330
WITH DON JOHNSON
SHOOTING A SCENE FOR <i> MIAMI VICE,</i>

15:56.413 --> 16:00.376
AND I HELD YOU IN
UNTIL THEY YELLED "CUT."

16:00.459 --> 16:02.711
- YOU HELD BACK LABOR
AND STAYED IN A HOT TUB?

16:02.795 --> 16:06.715
- WITH DON JOHNSON!

16:06.799 --> 16:08.717
- [groaning]

16:08.801 --> 16:10.886
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.930
YOU JUST ALLOWED YOUR FACE
TO BECOME UNATTRACTIVE.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.557
IT'S REAL PAIN.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.892
YOU'RE REALLY IN LABOR.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.728
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO PULL FOCUS.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.772
- I WAS AT FIRST, BUT THEN
THE REAL THING KICKED IN.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.399
EVEN I'M NOT THAT GOOD
OF AN ACTRESS.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.067
- SHE'S NOT WRONG.
I'VE SEEN <i> COLE'S LAW.</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:27.653
- IT'S <i> COLE'S...LAW.</i>

16:27.736 --> 16:28.904
OOH!

16:28.987 --> 16:30.406
- IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.408
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA GO
STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.200
- WHAT ABOUT THE PREMIERE?

16:33.283 --> 16:36.203
- EMMY,
MY BABY IS HAVING A BABY.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.455
NOW, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.749
- BUT THERE'S NO TIME.
THIS BABY IS COMING OUT.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.751
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR. DO SOMETHING.
- ME?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.087
ALL I COULD DO IS TELL HER
SHE'S BRUSHING HER TEETH WRONG.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.756
I COULD TELL ALL OF YOU THAT.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.299
- I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.801
LOOK, HER CONTRACTIONS
ARE COMING

16:50.884 --> 16:52.094
LESS THAN A MINUTE APART,

16:52.177 --> 16:53.929
SO SHE'S IN THE SECOND STAGE
OF LABOR.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.765
MY MOTHER WAS A MIDWIFE.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.268
THE ONLY PORN I SAW AS A KID
WAS BIRTHING VIDEOS,

16:59.351 --> 17:00.894
BUT STOP THEM
IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

17:00.978 --> 17:03.981
THEY GET YOU THERE.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.275
- SQUEEZE MY HAND AND BREATHE.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.277
- LET'S GET READY
FOR THAT BEAUTIFUL BABY.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.611
- [groaning]
- DON'T YOU WORRY, EMMY.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.612
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.156
YOU JUST TRY TO RELAX.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.659
- LUKE, SING OUR BATH TIME SONG.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.161
- [clears throat]

17:17.243 --> 17:21.290
♪ IN SILKEN ROBES
OF SCARLET ♪

17:21.373 --> 17:24.292
♪ SCARLET FRINGED

17:24.376 --> 17:26.086
- THANKS, WE'RE GOOD.

17:26.170 --> 17:30.132
- NO, I LIKE IT.

17:30.215 --> 17:34.344
- ♪ MY ELKA LOVE

17:34.428 --> 17:40.893
both:

17:46.523 --> 17:48.776
- OH, MY.
- SHE'S ADORABLE.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.819
- AW.
- SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.948
- #THATHAPPENED.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.284
- EMMY, SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.620
- I KNOW.
SHE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.790
- OH, HONEY.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.667
- MOM, I'M SORRY ABOUT
ALL THOSE THINGS I SAID TO YOU.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.503
I WAS SCARED JUST NOW,
BUT I KEPT THINKING,

18:07.586 --> 18:09.838
MY MOM'S HERE,
AND SHE'S GONNA KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.133
- WELL, I'M SORRY TOO.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.010
LOOK, I WAS JUST
FEELING GUILTY

18:15.093 --> 18:18.180
ABOUT NOT BEING THERE
AS A MOM AND--

18:18.263 --> 18:19.348
BUT WHEN YOU BECAME
AN ACTRESS,

18:19.431 --> 18:23.685
I WAS JUST SO HAPPY
BECAUSE WE HAD THAT CONNECTION.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.481
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE A SEPARATE PERSON,

18:27.564 --> 18:30.567
AND I RESPECT THE CHOICES
YOU'VE MADE.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.568
- I LOVE YOU, MOM.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.862
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.532
AND YOU ARE
A VERY LUCKY LITTLE GIRL.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.033
- [chuckles]

18:38.116 --> 18:39.535
BOB, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.370
YOU WERE A REAL ROCK.
- OH, REALLY.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.705
- YES, THAT WAS
VERY IMPRESSIVE, BOB.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.541
MAYBE THERE'S
A LITTLE STONE VAN BUREN

18:45.624 --> 18:46.375
IN YOU AFTER ALL.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.044
- OH, WELL,
MAYBE I COULD ARRANGE

18:49.127 --> 18:51.046
TO PUT A LITTLE
STONE VAN BUREN IN YOU.

18:51.129 --> 18:54.716
- AND YOU HAD TO RUIN IT.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.718
- WE'RE AT THE THEATER,
MS. CHASE,

18:56.802 --> 18:58.512
AND YOUR DAUGHTER'S AMBULANCE
SHOULD BE HERE SOON.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.347
- FORGET THE PREMIERE.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.224
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH EMMY

19:02.307 --> 19:04.226
AND MY GRAND--

19:04.309 --> 19:06.436
MY DAUGHTER-DAUGHTER.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.066
- OH, MY GOSH,
I HAVE TO CALL MY HUSBAND.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.359
- OH, OH, OF COURSE.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.194
I KEEP FORGETTING
THAT YOU'RE MARRIED.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.946
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET--

19:16.029 --> 19:17.406
THAT'S ALAN?

19:17.489 --> 19:18.740
HE'S GORGEOUS.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.741
- HE WAS A MODEL.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.160
- OH, MY GOD.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.247
