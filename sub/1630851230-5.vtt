- Hana.
- Hey.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.137
Welcome back.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.401
Here, I got this one.
- Oh, thank you.

00:10.445 --> 00:13.796
Oh, am I interrupting
something?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.450
- Only your
welcome home dinner.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.668
- Oh.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.324
Uh, are you making lamb chops?

00:20.368 --> 00:21.934
- Your favorite.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.242
How's your mom?

00:25.286 --> 00:26.809
- She's stable.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.246
My sister is in charge now,

00:29.290 --> 00:31.553
so I can go back
to living my normal life.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.815
Whatever that means.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.992
Wow.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.082
I mean, I knew Crosby's room
was going to be empty, but--

00:39.126 --> 00:40.736
- I know.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.521
I shipped his things
to Oklahoma a while back.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.610
- I'm gonna miss him.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.830
I will not miss
his smelly socks.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.008
- I asked the guy
at the wine store

00:52.052 --> 00:54.445
to find me a good pinot--
something fun.

00:54.489 --> 00:57.100
- Fun?
What does that even mean?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.407
- This, apparently.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.061
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.890
- Mmm.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.762
This wine is delicious.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.810
But you are a vegan who has
compromised her principals

01:11.854 --> 01:14.639

welcome home dinner.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.033
So come on,
what's the bad news?

01:19.601 --> 01:22.647

to be with Kenny.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.650
- That's great. For how long?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.217
- As long as it takes.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.526
I'm sorry that I didn't tell
you sooner,

01:31.569 --> 01:32.570

wanted us to take over.

possible arson.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.480
Fire ruined
most of the evidence,

06:33.523 --> 06:35.917
so there were no prints,
no DNA.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.135
Our fugitive's a John Doe.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.963
There were shell casings
at the scene,

06:39.007 --> 06:40.661
but it looks like
he took the weapon with him.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.445
- He also cut
the arcade security feed,

06:42.489 --> 06:44.926
but there's a camera outside
the jewelry store next door.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.755
Can't see the arcade,
but it did catch this.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
A Tesla, parked overnight.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.197
- Tesla--those things
have rear-facing cameras.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.982
If it was in Sentry Mode,
it could've caught our perp.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.462
- I'm working on finding
the owner now.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.333
- Victims are Ramon Raos

07:01.377 --> 07:03.161
and his 11-year-old son,
Michael.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.163
The arcade's manager,
William Duncan,

07:05.207 --> 07:07.252
was shot in the abdomen,
but he survived.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.646
He's in critical condition
at Mercy General.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.952
- Arson investigators said
they found

07:10.995 --> 07:12.649
an accelerant in the kitchen.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.085
Oil found on the countertops

07:14.129 --> 07:15.696
matches the brand they used
at the Fun Center,

07:15.739 --> 07:18.002
so it could look like
an accidental grease fire

07:18.046 --> 07:19.874
if it weren't for
the three people shot.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.832
- Maybe the fire
was to get rid of the victims.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.052
Anything on Ramon Raos?

07:24.095 --> 07:27.055
- He was technician.
Fixed pinball machines.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.797
We found his tools inside
next to this.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.059
- It's a model from the '80s.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.234
I mean, they were like
Twinkies.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.888
They're built to last.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.455
- The weird thing is there was
only one player name entered.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.414
A place like this, there should
be hundreds, right?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
He called himself Sicarius.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.549
- Maybe he was testing
the machine after he fixed it.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.681
- Yeah, but there's no prints.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.858
So it's more likely
our fugitive.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.774
- Sicarius.
That's the spider, right?

07:50.818 --> 07:52.646
One bite
and it's fatal to humans.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.518
- These have computer chips.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.477
Now, if Sicarius played,
there'd be a record.

there's a time stamp.

because Ramon
would never let him win.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.419
it's possible he uses that
as an online handle as well.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.942
I'm running it down now.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.596
- I found the owner
of the Tesla

13:34.639 --> 13:36.032
in the jewelry store
parking lot.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.729
Footage just came in.
Check it out.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.645
- So it's two unsubs, not one.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.560
- I'll put a BOLO out.
- Sounds good.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.562
Hey, Hana, can you run
those plates for me?

13:44.606 --> 13:45.650
- Already did.

13:45.694 --> 13:46.869
It's a joint registration

13:46.913 --> 13:49.306
to a Todd Carter
and Vicky Brokaw.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.134
- Unsubs no more.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.790
- Todd was employed
by Allentown FD until May.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.923
Vicky was a dispatcher
at the same time.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.794
- A former firefighter
would know the best way

13:58.838 --> 14:00.665
to cover up arson
is kitchen fire.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.754
Any criminal record?
- Nope.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.800
Neither of them have
a history of violent offenses.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.629
- Maybe the man who loaned
William Duncan 200 grand does?

14:07.672 --> 14:08.891
- Pat McKendrick?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.458
- Yeah.
Any luck finding him yet?

14:10.501 --> 14:13.809
- Yep, his address and criminal
record just came through.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.638
Allentown native whose
record shows he's not afraid

14:16.681 --> 14:18.858
to play rough
with those who don't pay.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.556
- We're talking broken bones
rough or horse head rough?

14:21.599 --> 14:23.427
- Both.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.125
- William owed this guy
200 grand.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.127
Maybe he hired Todd and Vicky
to kill him for not paying?

14:27.170 --> 14:29.781
- Let's find out.
You and Hana pay Pat a visit.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.958
Ortiz, track down
Todd and Vicky's car.

14:32.001 --> 14:35.135
Barnes, let's head to the
Allentown fire department.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.661
- Todd Carter and Vicky Brokaw.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.881
Did you hire them
to kill William Duncan?

14:43.839 --> 14:46.973
- You remind me of a pony
I got at Pimlico.

14:47.016 --> 14:51.716
Long legs, strong flowing mane.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.545
- Right. Flattered. I am.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.112
I'm also FBI.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.548
- If you don't want to lose
your business,

14:57.592 --> 14:58.854
you'll help us out.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.030
- Oh, and you're a feisty
one too?

15:01.074 --> 15:03.728
- Look, those two killed
a father and son

15:03.772 --> 15:04.860
and tried to murder
William Duncan,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.166
who owes you 200 grand.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.472
So you want to clear your name?
Now's the time.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.214
- Look, I don't know
Barbie and Ken here,

15:11.258 --> 15:13.869
and I wasn't worried
about William paying me back.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
We had a deal.
- You and William?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.525
- No, me and his father
Fred.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.570
- Fred said he didn't know
about his son's gambling debt.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.920
- Well, Fred lied,

15:20.963 --> 15:22.834
'cause he was here
three days ago.

15:22.878 --> 15:26.012
He promised to pay back
the debt with interest.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.535
- Well, did Fred tell you
how he planned

15:27.578 --> 15:29.189
on getting $200,000?

15:29.232 --> 15:33.497
- I don't ask questions I don't
want to know the answer to.

15:33.541 --> 15:37.719
However Fred got the money,
I gave him a month to do it.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.939
Why would I kill
my golden goose?

15:41.592 --> 15:43.507
- Todd was one of our
best firefighters.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.728
He and Vicky were planning
to get married, start a family.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.469
- Before he was fired?

15:49.600 --> 15:53.604
- Todd and Vicky murdered two
people, attempted another.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.957
- Look, Todd wasn't fired

15:58.000 --> 15:59.959
for any sort of deviant
behavior or anything.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.353
Six months ago,
he pocketed some money

16:03.397 --> 16:05.181
from the station
summer fundraiser.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.967
- You mean he stole?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.359
- Yeah.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.274
I guess he was
hard up for cash.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.580
Vicky quit in solidarity.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.190
- When was the last time
you saw them?

16:14.234 --> 16:17.150
- Todd called me last month,
wanted money.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.326
I said no.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.850
I wonder what would've happened
if I would've helped him out.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.682
- A person capable of looking
an 11-year-old boy in the eye

16:27.725 --> 16:30.467
and killing them was going
to snap at some point.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.472
- If you hear from them,
give us a call, okay?

16:35.516 --> 16:37.692
Thank you.

16:37.735 --> 16:38.823
- Hey.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.173
I was just about to call you.

16:40.216 --> 16:43.393
- Just spoke to Todd
and Vicky's former coworker.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.873
He said they were strapped
for cash.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.093
- Well, yeah,
so was Fred Duncan.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.790
He lied to us, Jess.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.661
<i>According to Pat McKendrick,</i>

16:50.705 --> 16:53.055
Fred promised to pay off
his son's gambling debt.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.970
My bet is he didn't have
- 200
- K lying around

16:55.014 --> 16:57.451
so he resorted
to mountain lightning.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.800
- Arson for insurance money.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.410
I thought that only happened
in Appalachia.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.369
- The storm has made
its way north.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.371
According to the state's
insurance board,

17:04.414 --> 17:07.417
Duncan's Family Fun Center
had a listed perils policy

17:07.461 --> 17:08.984
for $1 million.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.986
We think Fred hired
Todd and Vicky

17:11.030 --> 17:12.988
to burn it down
for insurance money.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.555
- Makes sense.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
He knew he could
make it look like an accident.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.211
<i>That's why they set the fire
in the kitchen.</i>

17:18.254 --> 17:19.516
- Exactly.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.865
It was after closing,

17:20.909 --> 17:22.650
no one was supposed
to be there,

17:22.693 --> 17:23.825
and no one was supposed
to get shot--

17:23.868 --> 17:25.827
especially not William Duncan.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.221
- I'm guessing Fred's
pretty ticked off about that.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.093
- Yeah, which means now
we're looking for him too.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.834

to the hospital

What the hell is this, Angelo?

34:56.833 --> 34:59.793
- Careful.
I'm no longer the help.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.624
- Just don't hurt her.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.626
- Sweet Abby.

35:06.669 --> 35:10.456
I've been planning to meet you
since the day you were born.

35:10.499 --> 35:13.937
Fred might not have kept tabs
on you, but where I've been

35:13.981 --> 35:18.159
for the past three decades,
all I had was time.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.682
Inside.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.559
It was in this very bed
that your grandfather

35:26.602 --> 35:28.865
raped a 13-year-old girl.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.826
I bet he doesn't even
remember her name.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.003
He threw her down
the stairs there,

35:36.046 --> 35:38.179
and the fall broke her neck.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.008
She died instantly.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.619
- Angelo, please. Let her go.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.839
- But here's the real
messed-up part.

35:45.882 --> 35:49.582
Instead of your grandfather
taking responsibility,

35:49.625 --> 35:54.195
he got his rich papa
to rig the trial.

35:54.239 --> 35:57.590
So it wasn't him who spent
35 years in supermax,

35:57.633 --> 36:00.375
it was me.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.464
You see the problem here, Abby.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.467
- Angelo. You're innocent.

36:05.511 --> 36:07.774
I admit that.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.776
But so is she.

36:09.819 --> 36:12.561
She had nothing to do
with what happened that night.

I'm talking about how much
I'm gonna make you pay.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.368
