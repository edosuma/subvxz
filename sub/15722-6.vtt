00:01.174 --> 00:04.455
Do you believe that
a deity can hear our prayers?

00:04.539 --> 00:06.850
Or is it a divine force
that created our universe?

00:06.920 --> 00:08.167
Did that chick spray you with something?

00:08.251 --> 00:09.752
Here's a list of the labs using

00:09.836 --> 00:12.517
a South Korean stem cell line
for disease related gene therapy.

00:12.657 --> 00:15.299
Ok, Wes, tell me the truth.
How much time do I have to finish my work?

00:15.383 --> 00:16.759
The clock's ticking.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.429
Shit!

00:19.512 --> 00:22.348
I think the South Korean stem
cell line is producing a retrovirus.

00:22.535 --> 00:23.723
What?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.356
Ok, what kind of virus
are we talking about?

00:25.435 --> 00:28.950
Don't know. Could give you
the sniffles, could be the next AIDS.

00:29.444 --> 00:31.315
When I talk to Glenn,
I can feel him listening.

00:31.568 --> 00:33.590
So, we're going to go
for a jog in Central Park.

00:34.655 --> 00:37.383
Why would there be
a farm in the subway?

00:37.626 --> 00:41.112
Why would someone want
to grow something in a subway?

00:41.288 --> 00:44.412
Because you wouldn't want
anyone to know what you were growing.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.663
Marijuana, Psilocybin
Mushrooms, Opium...

00:47.745 --> 00:49.250
They got a grow op down there.

00:49.337 --> 00:50.963
Dude, I can't get rid of it, it's not mine.

00:51.095 --> 00:52.823
It's the people or the pot, Owen.

00:53.158 --> 00:54.253
Hi, dad.

00:54.336 --> 00:56.130
She's not here any more, David.

00:56.218 --> 00:57.432
My mom was an orphan,

00:57.536 --> 01:00.132
so there is silence
on that side of the family.

01:00.306 --> 01:01.720
My dad is Swedish.

01:01.807 --> 01:04.343
Which is major silence.
I was an only child.

01:04.787 --> 01:06.763
You know, maybe it's time you
let her off the hook, Dad.

01:07.016 --> 01:08.211
Why should I?

01:10.686 --> 01:12.621
Because she's dead, Dad.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.900
Mom...

01:15.677 --> 01:17.623
I will miss you every day

01:18.678 --> 01:21.072
for the rest of my life.

01:22.868 --> 01:24.912
Come on, Dad.
I'll make you some dinner.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.923
That's your mother's job.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.132
She doesn't like anybody
else in the kitchen.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.751
<i>Xylella fastidiosa.</i>

01:35.216 --> 01:36.960
In Brazil, it's responsible

01:37.058 --> 01:39.950
for the destruction
of over 34 % of the citrus crop.

01:40.118 --> 01:43.140
Isn't Brazil a little out
of our jurisdiction?

01:43.285 --> 01:45.401
It is. Florida isn't.

01:47.438 --> 01:51.043
Salvador Charringa has over
10,000 acres of citrus groves

01:51.257 --> 01:53.563
- outside Miami...
- The same Salvador Charringa

01:53.648 --> 01:56.643
who openly admits he helped
finance the Bay of Pigs.

01:56.838 --> 01:59.351
He lost a lot when
he was exiled by Castro.

01:59.695 --> 02:02.173
10,000 acres of Florida oranges:

02:02.367 --> 02:05.250
- looks like he landed on his feet.
- Not quite.

02:05.866 --> 02:09.412
This is what 1,500 of those acres

02:10.038 --> 02:11.943
looked like as of last week.

02:12.168 --> 02:15.332
Charringa's scientists are claiming

02:15.787 --> 02:18.682
it's a biologically engineered
form of the bacterium

02:18.905 --> 02:21.270
and the only cure for it
is to kill the patient.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.221
What are we talking about?
Agricultural terrorism?

02:23.397 --> 02:26.142
A little over 2 months ago, 3 teenagers
where caught in Charringa's grove.

02:26.408 --> 02:29.300
They admitted taking money
to release a dozen crates

02:29.446 --> 02:31.353
of an insect called
a leafhopper into his--

02:31.566 --> 02:34.030
- Could you be more specific?
- More specific?

02:35.427 --> 02:39.193
- It was a sharpshooter leafhopper.
- Oh, that makes sense.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.950
What makes sense?

02:41.068 --> 02:43.612
Well it explains why
the bacterium is spreading so fast.

02:43.698 --> 02:47.852
<i>See, the X. fastidiosa bacterium
multiplies in the foregut</i>

02:47.997 --> 02:50.121
of the sharpshooter. Then they spread it

02:50.165 --> 02:52.120
from tree to tree
where it multiplies again

02:52.205 --> 02:53.753
and then other
sharpshooters pick it up

02:53.836 --> 02:55.753
and they pass it on to other trees...

02:55.835 --> 02:57.583
Did those kids say who paid them?

02:57.675 --> 02:59.500
Quote. "Old Cuban dudes

02:59.545 --> 03:03.422
with bad breath and real shiny shoes."
End quote.

03:03.506 --> 03:05.130
That sounds pretty thin, Connor.

03:05.328 --> 03:08.093
Charringa made it thick
enough to convince the US.

03:08.186 --> 03:09.973
to demand an inspection

03:10.018 --> 03:12.512
of Cuba's Center for Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology.

03:13.006 --> 03:14.681
- And?
- It came up clean.

03:14.775 --> 03:16.342
So what's the problem?

03:17.358 --> 03:20.983
The US has insisted
upon looking at 7 other suspected labs.

03:21.065 --> 03:22.823
And Cuba doesn't want
to play along anymore.

03:22.906 --> 03:25.533
They're claiming the old labs
are nothing but empty shells.

03:25.858 --> 03:27.362
According to some experts,

03:27.458 --> 03:30.910
Florida could be on the verge of
a plague of biblical proportions.

03:31.855 --> 03:33.921
We'd like to know if it's God's will

03:34.188 --> 03:35.801
or Fidel's?

2.06 - Our Men in Havana

05:06.175 --> 05:09.171
In 1936, there was Dora Maar,

05:09.585 --> 05:12.121
she was a photographer. And in 1943,

05:12.286 --> 05:15.403
there was Françoise Gilot, she was a...

05:15.518 --> 05:17.783
She was a painter.
Then there was Jacqueline Roque.

05:17.997 --> 05:19.942
Picasso changed his women

05:20.038 --> 05:22.242
as often
as he changed his painting styles.

05:22.396 --> 05:24.620
So what are you saying,
that if you had left mom

05:24.727 --> 05:26.861
you would have been as great
as Picasso? Is that it?

05:27.126 --> 05:30.331
I'm just saying that
the right woman can be inspiring.

05:30.545 --> 05:31.491
Jesus.

05:34.115 --> 05:35.841
Did you ever love her?

05:39.395 --> 05:40.720
You  want soup?

05:41.676 --> 05:42.810
No.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.881
Picasso was a showman, you know?

05:49.217 --> 05:51.931
Dad, look, I made some phone calls...

05:52.075 --> 05:55.101
He knew how to sell the world
all that crap he was painting.

05:55.475 --> 05:56.890
It's all a big show.

05:57.046 --> 05:59.310
I know you'd never want
to move out of here so...

05:59.508 --> 06:00.680
Dad?

06:01.088 --> 06:02.802
- What are you looking for?
- Bowls!

06:03.055 --> 06:05.142
She keeps moving things around.

06:10.897 --> 06:12.572
- Aren't you having any?
- No!

06:12.737 --> 06:16.331
Look, I want you to... I want you
to meet with a care giver, all right?

06:16.576 --> 06:17.480
A what?

06:17.646 --> 06:19.171
You know, someone
to help you out around here.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.411
Why the hell would I need that?

06:30.385 --> 06:32.381
- What's that?
- It's me.

06:37.845 --> 06:40.422
- Hey.
- How is it going, David?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.092
Oh, have you got a pandemic
or something to amuse me with?

06:43.395 --> 06:45.812
Look, I know you don't
need me calling you right now.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.940
No, I need you to call me right now.

06:48.026 --> 06:50.661
<i>Well, we have a problem
in Florida, possibly bioterrorism.</i>

06:50.845 --> 06:52.921
- What are you doing?
- I'm on the phone.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.153
Oh,  Jesus. No, not you.

06:55.285 --> 06:57.860
Sorry. So... What is, uh...

06:58.335 --> 07:00.122
Is Carlos down there already?

07:00.318 --> 07:03.533
<i>Yeah, but I like you
to go down as soon as you can.</i>

07:03.886 --> 07:06.383
Ok, well I can be down there

07:06.948 --> 07:10.133
<i>- first thing tomorrow morning.
- Oh, that's great, thank you.</i>

07:10.487 --> 07:11.463
Bye.

07:14.808 --> 07:17.850
Good. I'm glad he's on board.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.220
What's your take on this, Connor?

07:21.306 --> 07:24.110
The US is a nation of sheep, Caroline.

07:24.636 --> 07:27.130
Herded by a President who feels

07:27.305 --> 07:30.483
"ordained"
to stop terrorist acts at any cost.

07:30.925 --> 07:33.482
He wouldn't hesitate to drive
his herd over a cliff

07:33.598 --> 07:36.712
- if it served his purpose.
- God bless America.

07:40.768 --> 07:46.070
I'm... under a lot of pressure from
Homeland Security to get this resolved.

07:46.338 --> 07:48.210
Call me anytime, Caroline.

07:58.856 --> 08:00.641
Sure you don't want any soup?

08:02.236 --> 08:03.201
No.

08:05.128 --> 08:06.560
Me neither.

08:08.275 --> 08:09.743
Why did you do it then?

08:09.905 --> 08:12.190
- I'm going to give it to him.
- No you're not.

08:13.655 --> 08:16.163
David, I'm not going
to let you do this.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.863
You don't understand,
your father can't survive without us.

08:20.028 --> 08:21.333
I don't care.

08:24.056 --> 08:26.282
Yeah, hey, Lilith. Do you even check
your messages?

08:26.495 --> 08:29.243
Because this is like,
the fifteenth one from me.

08:29.516 --> 08:32.702
I'm not nagging, I'm just...
Call me, ok?

08:32.914 --> 08:35.883
I want to talk to you about putting
a bullet in my head when I get old.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.696
I'm thinking a .38,
back of the right ear,

08:38.794 --> 08:41.600
But if you want to go Kurt
Cobain on me, that's fine.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.095
You're nuts.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.420
Gotta go.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.850
- Where is she?
- Who, Lilith?

08:48.996 --> 08:50.171
No, your...

08:51.975 --> 08:53.323
Never  mind...

08:53.495 --> 08:55.111
Let's go back in the house, Dad.

09:00.058 --> 09:01.243
Who's that?

09:01.646 --> 09:04.402
Oh, I called an assisted care service.

09:04.616 --> 09:06.300
And what do I need that for?

09:06.536 --> 09:10.273
Just someone to have around
the house and make things easier...

09:10.836 --> 09:11.923
for you.

09:19.595 --> 09:20.613
Dad...

09:21.137 --> 09:23.171
I'd like you to meet
Charlotte Whenning.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.693
Oh, Charlie's ok.

09:27.925 --> 09:29.903
Hello, Mr. Sandstrom.

09:33.937 --> 09:36.480
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.700
Oh, why? You didn't know her.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.240
Dad, come on. Be nice.
Charlotte's here to help.

09:41.927 --> 09:43.031
How?

09:43.876 --> 09:45.443
How are you going to help me?

09:45.695 --> 09:47.912
Well, I can cook 3 square meals, pick up,

09:48.055 --> 09:50.722
and I stuff
a pretty mean pipe.

09:51.456 --> 09:54.910
Well, I don't need anyone to stuff my pipe.

09:55.186 --> 09:57.582
OK, so she won't stuff your pipe.

09:57.755 --> 09:59.823
Come on Dad, this'll be good.

10:00.908 --> 10:02.681
What else can you do?

10:02.896 --> 10:05.622
As much or as little as you want me to.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.070
All right, now I want to have a bath.

10:09.198 --> 10:11.062
Sure. You have trouble
getting in the tub?

10:11.335 --> 10:12.362
No.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.071
He's Swedish.

10:26.737 --> 10:30.091
- Simon, I thought you went back to London.
- You know, they're very reluctant

10:30.237 --> 10:32.723
to let you leave the country
when you lose your passport.

10:32.947 --> 10:34.530
You lost your passport?

10:34.687 --> 10:36.340
It's ok. Not the first time.

10:36.526 --> 10:38.803
I'll have another one in a couple of days.
How are you doing?

10:38.947 --> 10:40.532
Well, actually, if you have 2 minutes,

10:41.468 --> 10:44.353
I have a friend who is in a
persistent vegetative state.

10:45.016 --> 10:46.581
That's tough.

10:46.826 --> 10:49.330
He's 18 now.
Had a stroke while he was running.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.350
He lost all higher cerebral power,

10:51.528 --> 10:53.662
but he still maintains sleep/wake cycles

10:53.796 --> 10:56.742
and full hypothalamic and
brain stem autonomic functions.

10:57.077 --> 10:59.961
Ok. What about visual,
auditory, tactile stimuli?

11:00.106 --> 11:03.801
Well, it's unusual.
Because... when I talk to him,

11:04.068 --> 11:05.730
sometimes he responds.

11:06.725 --> 11:08.732
- How do you mean?
- He moves his foot.

11:08.965 --> 11:11.643
I mean, he doesn't do it
every time I talk to him,

11:11.787 --> 11:12.853
but sometimes.

11:13.525 --> 11:15.603
Bob, PVS patients don't do that.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.572
So, he's either
been misdiagnosed,

11:17.727 --> 11:19.660
or he's progressed toward emergence.

11:19.835 --> 11:20.830
Yeah.

11:20.978 --> 11:23.492
In England, we've
been experimenting with MRI

11:23.658 --> 11:26.800
to track brain activity in
mimimally conscious patients.

11:26.988 --> 11:28.472
Results are inconclusive,

11:28.768 --> 11:30.120
but I would bet my last pound

11:30.285 --> 11:32.992
that some of those people
can hear and understand.

11:33.116 --> 11:34.242
See, that's what I think.

11:34.386 --> 11:37.471
I think he's closer to
the surface than we thought.

11:37.918 --> 11:41.400
- I'd really like to see your results.
- Oh yeah, yeah. I'll e-mail you my study.

11:42.997 --> 11:44.251
But listen...

11:44.735 --> 11:46.831
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, you know.

11:47.048 --> 11:49.332
This stuff is
way off the map.

11:49.966 --> 11:51.113
I know.

11:52.405 --> 11:55.920
But that's exactly where you have
to go if you want to find a miracle.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.671
It's ok. It's ok.

13:20.955 --> 13:22.380
So the last report indicates

13:22.515 --> 13:24.913
the bacterium has
spread to neighboring groves.

13:26.545 --> 13:28.713
Close to 1,700 acres.

13:32.515 --> 13:35.402
You know, David, I can review
the research down here by myself

13:35.505 --> 13:37.783
- if you like.
- Oh no. It's fine.

13:50.156 --> 13:53.920
You know, I never understood why
my mother stayed with my father.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.572
She never told me.

13:59.056 --> 14:01.282
I don't think he'll ever be able to.

14:02.325 --> 14:04.631
Does it really matter why she stayed?

14:04.827 --> 14:06.611
It all matters, Carlos.

14:06.915 --> 14:08.753
It all fits together.

14:11.845 --> 14:14.242
It all fits together, somehow.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.610
I think we're here.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.773
Yes, we are always aggressive

14:39.937 --> 14:42.931
when it comes to protecting
a billion dollar industry.

14:43.385 --> 14:45.130
You've read
our report haven't you?

14:45.216 --> 14:47.132
- Of course.
- Then you are aware

14:47.278 --> 14:51.132
<i>that we are not dealing with a known
strain of the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium.</i>

14:51.285 --> 14:53.441
According to your research
that's what it appears.

14:53.678 --> 14:56.090
You say that as if
our research is not credible.

14:56.266 --> 14:58.480
I'm sorry, no.
I didn't mean to discredit your--

14:58.645 --> 14:59.780
Please!

15:00.175 --> 15:02.813
I understand
the severity of your accusation.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.383
No, no, no. It's good to get
a second, third, fourth opinion.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.612
But I don't believe
the science will change.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.023
I am not suggesting it will.

15:11.665 --> 15:15.132
So tell me:
why this is any business of some...

15:15.467 --> 15:17.041
Canadian Biology Lab?

15:17.168 --> 15:18.700
Let me take a crack at that one.

15:18.878 --> 15:21.003
- David...
- No, no, no. It's a good question.

15:21.095 --> 15:24.700
You see Hernando, some people
with cooler heads get it cooler.

15:24.986 --> 15:28.801
They just want to make sure that if Georgie boy
is going to drop 400 megatons of shit on a country

15:28.905 --> 15:31.751
that that country is actually responsible
for what they're accused of.

15:32.476 --> 15:34.721
So far, I'd say he's oh for one.

15:37.606 --> 15:38.933
This way.

15:40.946 --> 15:42.190
This way.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.021
Come on, Glenn, you're falling behind.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.672
We're  almost there.
We've got to get to the top.

15:55.957 --> 15:58.513
- Faster, Glenn, come on.
- Ok, stop.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.482
All right, again.

16:02.277 --> 16:03.621
Why are you stopping Glenn?

16:03.695 --> 16:05.761
I'm way up here
on top of the hill.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.020
I'm  running down now Glenn.

16:09.557 --> 16:11.143
There's Caroline.

16:13.768 --> 16:15.711
You recognize her, don't you?

16:16.008 --> 16:17.681
I'm going
to beat you to her.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.531
Catch me if you can.

16:19.686 --> 16:21.351
Ok. Look fine. Stop.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.752
It's pretty likely a response.

16:26.858 --> 16:29.212
I know. He can hear me, can't he?

16:29.926 --> 16:32.233
It does seem more
than random, yeah, but...

16:32.518 --> 16:34.181
I don't want
to get ahead of ourselves.

16:34.378 --> 16:37.260
Ok, so I've looked into the
Cognitive Stimulation Program,

16:37.395 --> 16:40.481
and the Traumatic Brain Injury Project,
and I've talked to people

16:40.586 --> 16:42.971
at the Centre for Neuro Skills
in Texas and California...

16:43.096 --> 16:45.161
- Ok, Bob--
- They're all very interesting programs

16:45.337 --> 16:46.933
but I just don't know
what is best for Glenn,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.620
and I thought looking at your,
which is impressive and inspiring

16:49.835 --> 16:51.523
that you might be able
to point me in the right direction.

16:51.675 --> 16:54.281
Tell me what to do!
What's the best thing I can do for Glenn?

16:54.405 --> 16:55.483
Bob!

16:57.217 --> 16:59.300
These things take a little time.

17:01.525 --> 17:03.152
I know.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.102
I understand.

17:08.906 --> 17:12.262
I mean, will his parents
be willing to volunteer him?

17:12.964 --> 17:14.563
His parents are gone.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.991
Caroline is his legal guardian.

17:18.075 --> 17:19.800
Caroline Morrison?

17:20.146 --> 17:23.213
I think that's
probably where we start.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.290
Fuck!

17:26.647 --> 17:27.571
What?

17:28.125 --> 17:29.303
Here you go.

17:31.626 --> 17:34.463
A fucking empire of dirt in
the gut of a leafhopper.

17:34.565 --> 17:37.543
Just where Charringa's
scientists said it would be.

17:41.668 --> 17:43.753
You think we're being set up?

17:43.947 --> 17:44.991
What do you mean?

17:46.386 --> 17:48.891
I mean, Charringa and the White House

17:49.316 --> 17:51.060
start a little conspiracy,

17:51.206 --> 17:52.642
go after Castro...

17:54.088 --> 17:57.290
<i>So Charringa infests
his own groves with fastidiosa,</i>

17:57.565 --> 17:59.153
claims it's done by the Cubans

17:59.355 --> 18:02.301
- to justify the invasion of Cuba.
- Yeah, what do you think?

18:02.788 --> 18:04.080
That's insane.

18:04.315 --> 18:05.733
He will destroy
everything he has.

18:05.928 --> 18:07.100
You're right.

18:07.257 --> 18:10.453
Maybe I've just been hanging out
with too many crazy old men lately.

18:13.198 --> 18:14.302
Let's take it apart.

19:13.626 --> 19:15.852
I've got to go, Connor.
Thanks for calling.

19:16.298 --> 19:17.101
Bye bye.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.392
Yeah?

19:18.646 --> 19:20.160
David and Carlos called.

19:20.608 --> 19:21.982
They have nothing to report.

19:22.206 --> 19:23.752
Well actually, they won't report anything

19:23.897 --> 19:25.592
until they have finished
their investigation in Florida.

19:25.726 --> 19:26.931
- What is that about?

19:27.396 --> 19:29.540
I don't know.
They weren't really talking.

19:30.897 --> 19:31.983
All right.

19:32.427 --> 19:33.823
I want to talk to David.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.191
McGuinn is leaning on us
and I need some answers.

19:36.336 --> 19:37.473
All right, I'll give it a try.

19:38.045 --> 19:39.181
Hi Bob.

19:40.605 --> 19:42.332
- Simon?
- Hello.

19:42.577 --> 19:44.701
Caroline, I know you wanted
to keep this between us

19:44.888 --> 19:47.923
but I guess the only reason I got involved is
because I saw you and you allowed me to get involved

19:48.066 --> 19:50.532
but I wanted more.
So, I asked Simon if he could help me

19:50.767 --> 19:53.403
and he said some very good things,
that I think might help us.

19:53.585 --> 19:55.580
- It's all right Bob.
- But I didn't want to say anything

19:55.747 --> 19:57.631
until I knew
that Simon could help us.

19:57.956 --> 20:00.122
- Help us?
- Stimulate Glenn's brain.

20:00.268 --> 20:03.120
- Oh Bob...
- Caroline, listen to Simon...

20:04.128 --> 20:05.060
please.

20:07.855 --> 20:09.580
All right. Sit down.

20:12.317 --> 20:15.230
Caroline... I don't want
to mislead you in any way.

20:16.325 --> 20:18.441
I believe that
Glenn is in a minimally-conscious state

20:18.638 --> 20:21.680
and that he can and is
responding to outside stimuli.

20:21.886 --> 20:25.720
Ok Simon, I know your work.
I respect you as a scientist. But...

20:26.625 --> 20:28.901
Do you really
think there is hope?

20:29.025 --> 20:30.302
There's a glimmer.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.612
And that's enough for most neuroscientists
to want to take things further.

20:33.828 --> 20:34.853
Ok, tell me.

20:34.998 --> 20:37.141
Ok. We're getting
some motor reactions

20:37.265 --> 20:38.933
when Bob talks
to him about running.

20:39.347 --> 20:40.453
I tell him stories

20:40.677 --> 20:42.523
and his foot moves.
He's trying to run.

20:42.636 --> 20:44.971
Ok, and the first thing
would be to boost that stimuli.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.400
And this is where
you would come in.

20:46.568 --> 20:49.171
But more tests... to what end?

20:50.726 --> 20:54.030
I mean, Simon,
do you really believe...

20:55.175 --> 20:57.951
Do you really believe
Glenn could wake up?

20:58.618 --> 21:00.121
One step at a time.

21:04.025 --> 21:07.150
<i>Ok, we both agree this is a
completely new strain of fastidiosa, right?</i>

21:07.327 --> 21:08.933
But not necessarily engineered.

21:09.157 --> 21:12.631
Right.  But the closest match to it
is a strain that comes out of Cuba. So?

21:12.907 --> 21:14.033
David I cannot...

21:14.158 --> 21:17.273
I won't say with 100% certainty,
that it came from there.

21:17.368 --> 21:20.361
Two million gene sequences
on the NCBI database.

21:20.505 --> 21:22.203
But it's not an identical match.

21:22.388 --> 21:24.733
Well, it's going to be enough
evidence for the Americans.

21:24.898 --> 21:26.032
Fuck!

21:27.606 --> 21:29.100
What are we going to tell Caroline?

21:29.706 --> 21:32.023
I'm not sure.
We tell her what we know,

21:32.166 --> 21:35.080
we're pretty much putting
the bullets in that gun aimed at Fidel.

21:37.448 --> 21:40.400
Look, if they want us to find out

21:40.525 --> 21:42.833
exactly what's in those Cuban labs,

21:42.947 --> 21:44.550
we're going to have to inspect them.

21:44.687 --> 21:46.081
If they'll let us.

21:46.477 --> 21:47.893
How much time we got?

21:48.157 --> 21:50.022
Little over 48 hours.

21:50.216 --> 21:51.192
Peachy.

21:51.548 --> 21:52.652
Wrong fruit.

21:52.925 --> 21:55.783
<i>Buenos tardes mis amigo de NorBac.</i>

21:55.987 --> 21:57.133
Charringa?

21:57.438 --> 21:58.483
I think so.

21:58.755 --> 22:02.030
<i>Ven por favor.
Acompaname a cenar.</i>

22:03.036 --> 22:05.810
I think he just invited us to supper.

22:07.388 --> 22:10.140
General Batista was never the answer.

22:10.868 --> 22:13.670
He had his own agenda
dictated by the US.

22:13.838 --> 22:16.861
But Castro, that was
an abysmal alternative.

22:16.998 --> 22:19.603
Uh, Senor Charringa do you really think

22:19.796 --> 22:22.301
that Castro is behind this
plague in your orange groves?

22:22.446 --> 22:25.110
I was there when
Camilo and Che lead

22:25.335 --> 22:27.443
their guerrilla
columns into Havana.

22:28.177 --> 22:30.540
When my land,
my family's land,

22:30.768 --> 22:32.073
was expropriated

22:32.377 --> 22:34.460
and turned into state farms.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.871
When my very own sister,
stripped our bank accounts

22:38.098 --> 22:39.722
to support that mad man.

22:40.487 --> 22:42.833
Fifteen thousand machine guns

22:43.528 --> 22:45.740
that's what 5 generations

22:45.996 --> 22:49.322
of Charringa blood and sweat,

22:50.068 --> 22:53.180
and pride were reduced to.

22:57.298 --> 23:00.042
<i>Tu mujer</i>

23:00.658 --> 23:02.742
<i>y tu hija</i>

23:03.475 --> 23:06.970
<i>son muy vacas.</i>

23:09.568 --> 23:11.291
I hope your knowledge

23:11.435 --> 23:14.550
of science is better
than your Spanish.

23:14.878 --> 23:16.672
David, you just referred

23:16.835 --> 23:18.712
to his wife and
daughter, hmm...

23:19.556 --> 23:20.722
as cows.

23:20.958 --> 23:21.933
Pretty. Pretty, pretty.

23:22.508 --> 23:23.973
<i>Ah... Guapas.</i>

23:24.326 --> 23:25.502
<i>- Muy Grappas.
- Gua-pas.</i>

23:25.718 --> 23:27.801
<i>Guapas. Muy guapas. </i>

23:29.077 --> 23:31.323
Dr. Sandstrom and I are not convinced

23:31.406 --> 23:33.472
that the bacterium
was manufactured.

23:33.608 --> 23:34.670
That's absurd.

23:34.825 --> 23:37.033
Or you know,
maybe it is man-made.

23:38.018 --> 23:40.921
Maybe it was man-made.
Sent over to destroy your oranges

23:41.156 --> 23:43.851
and ruin you as a million
dollar citrus supplier.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.372
Billion dollar.

23:45.605 --> 23:48.331
Billion dollar
citrus supplier.

23:48.766 --> 23:52.271
In that case, should Castro be avenged?

23:52.535 --> 23:56.470
I didn't say Castro was behind this.
I think you did. But to your point:

23:57.298 --> 23:59.163
if he is behind this? Sure.

23:59.315 --> 24:01.550
Drop all the bombs on him you want
if it'll make you feel better.

24:01.776 --> 24:02.911
It would.

24:03.085 --> 24:05.242
You'll have one dead
80 year old revolutionary

24:05.426 --> 24:08.090
and he will still have destroyed
a billion dollar citrus crop.

24:09.226 --> 24:12.403
- Your point?
- Who cares where the bacteria came from.

24:12.648 --> 24:15.552
Wouldn't it be better to figure out
how to get rid of it?

24:16.925 --> 24:18.673
I care where it came from.

24:27.238 --> 24:28.501
Yeah, come in.

24:28.757 --> 24:29.772
Well apparently,

24:29.917 --> 24:32.010
the Cubans are open to
David and Carlos going.

24:32.157 --> 24:34.103
So let's send them
before they change their minds.

24:35.616 --> 24:37.003
I will, Connor.

24:41.735 --> 24:43.171
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:43.366 --> 24:45.053
- What's up?
- Look...

24:45.715 --> 24:47.403
I know it's none of my business,

24:48.228 --> 24:50.851
but is everything
OK with you and Bob?

24:52.597 --> 24:54.680
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- Yeah?

24:54.805 --> 24:55.993
- Yeah.
- Ok.

24:56.645 --> 24:58.111
This just arrived.

24:59.067 --> 25:00.751
Thought I'd bring it up to you.

25:01.995 --> 25:03.040
Thanks.

25:04.918 --> 25:06.242
So...

25:06.598 --> 25:10.110
is there anything
we can do to help you with, uh...

25:10.395 --> 25:12.832
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

25:15.278 --> 25:16.253
I'm fine.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.153
- Ok. Yep.
- Of course you are.

25:18.385 --> 25:20.291
I'm sorry. Yeah. Ok.

25:22.466 --> 25:23.752
Hey guys.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.323
You want to sit down
for a couple of minutes?

25:30.446 --> 25:32.872
Glenn was born
with an enlarged heart.

25:34.006 --> 25:35.641
His father had
the same kind of heart

25:35.926 --> 25:38.602
and he died when
Glenn was barely a year old.

25:38.806 --> 25:40.602
He was your sister's only child?

25:40.866 --> 25:41.942
Yeah.

25:43.287 --> 25:45.022
I was half way across the world

25:45.265 --> 25:46.601
on a job for N.A.T.O.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.143
when Glenn collapsed

25:49.345 --> 25:51.090
at a track meet.

25:52.846 --> 25:55.360
It was a complication

25:55.688 --> 25:58.682
with his heart.
A clot hit his brain.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.021
It was really tough for Meg.

26:04.247 --> 26:06.663
She'd just been diagnosed with cancer

26:07.507 --> 26:10.301
and she went downhill from that day on.

26:15.886 --> 26:18.450
But I promised her
I would take care of him

26:18.735 --> 26:20.421
and I didn't...

26:21.738 --> 26:23.690
I just don't know how.

26:24.707 --> 26:26.572
You must be going through hell.

26:27.856 --> 26:29.303
Yeah.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.821
Thank you for...

26:34.068 --> 26:35.940
making me talk about it.

26:36.518 --> 26:38.600
I don't do that enough.

26:39.418 --> 26:42.182
- Well, is there anything that we can do?
- No.

26:43.308 --> 26:45.221
Meg believed that...

26:45.517 --> 26:48.150
one day a miracle would happen

26:48.298 --> 26:50.642
and she would see
her baby run again.

26:51.336 --> 26:53.403
Maybe, I don't know, maybe...

26:54.727 --> 26:56.543
we can make it happen.

27:52.158 --> 27:53.801
<i>Ellos son los inspectores de NorBAC.</i>

27:54.016 --> 27:55.851
<i>Mucho gracias. Hola.</i>

27:56.137 --> 27:57.641
<i>Doctore Eva Ramone.</i>

27:57.808 --> 28:01.051
<i>Director del Instituto para la
Investigación Biológica.</i>

28:01.205 --> 28:03.743
- How do you do?
- Hola. Doctor Carlos Serrano.

28:03.965 --> 28:06.320
North American Biotechnology
Advisory Commission.

28:06.767 --> 28:07.793
David Sandstrom.

28:08.198 --> 28:10.640
So this is the lab
we're supposed to inspect?

28:11.038 --> 28:12.582
Yes. One of them.

28:12.828 --> 28:16.832
This used to be a
state of the art lab,

28:17.198 --> 28:19.093
until all our funds

28:19.256 --> 28:21.602
were diverted
for our vaccine effort.

28:22.747 --> 28:23.971
<i>Podrian esperar afuera.</i>

28:24.125 --> 28:26.523
<i>No hay suficiente espacio para
todos adentro de mi oficina.</i>

28:26.686 --> 28:27.922
<i>Por favore, please.</i>

28:36.268 --> 28:38.160
Back in 1998,

28:38.527 --> 28:41.083
5 of our agriculture labs

28:41.225 --> 28:43.681
<i>were working
on the fastidiosa bacterium,</i>

28:43.926 --> 28:46.341
because it was attacking
our sugar cane crop.

28:46.755 --> 28:49.181
President Castro visited us in this lab

28:49.538 --> 28:52.410
to congratulate us for our efforts

28:52.656 --> 28:54.882
in eradicating the bacterium.

28:55.648 --> 28:58.112
<i>This is the
fastidiosa bacterium.</i>

28:58.306 --> 29:00.363
B-F 1998C.

29:01.328 --> 29:03.742
This is the one from
the NCBI data base?

29:04.025 --> 29:08.320
<i>Yes. You have a sample of the
fastidiosa bacterium from the orange grove?</i>

29:08.468 --> 29:10.762
- Yes, we do.
- Very well. Please,

29:11.098 --> 29:14.512
if you believe we have engineered it
into a more virulent strain,

29:14.707 --> 29:17.683
you should have everything
you need to compare the samples.

29:18.015 --> 29:20.271
Thank you. Let's get to work.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.253
There's nothing growing
on the trimethoprim or the kanamycin.

29:56.477 --> 29:58.383
It's a nice comparative
antibiotic susceptibility

29:58.576 --> 30:00.061
except with
the chloramphenicol.

30:00.918 --> 30:02.721
Is it enough to call off the dogs?

30:02.867 --> 30:04.741
It's enough to prove
that whatever brought us here

30:04.918 --> 30:07.383
isn't the same as what's in
those orange groves in Florida.

30:09.635 --> 30:11.943
<i>This Laboratorio Bioquímico.
Can we see it next?</i>

30:12.188 --> 30:15.750
Of course.
You will be very disappointed.

30:16.006 --> 30:19.591
The lab is right now
a warehouse for sugar cane.

30:19.795 --> 30:21.252
We still need to see it.

30:21.548 --> 30:24.071
Would you like to meet
the ex-director of the lab?

30:24.286 --> 30:25.351
That might be helpful.

30:25.915 --> 30:27.871
I can make arrangements for tomorrow.

30:28.086 --> 30:30.052
Any chance
we can do it without them?

30:30.725 --> 30:33.241
Do you have a problem
with authority, Dr. Sandstrom?

30:33.728 --> 30:36.542
Uh, it's David, and yes I do.

30:37.566 --> 30:39.102
Let's see what I can do.

30:46.607 --> 30:47.871
He's a what?

30:48.518 --> 30:50.510
A tennis coach for the tourists.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.261
And he's almost as good at that
as he is at yeast biology.

30:54.558 --> 30:55.551
PhD?

30:56.246 --> 30:57.713
Why isn't he in a lab?

30:57.837 --> 31:01.191
He is. He works at the
National Biopreparations Center,

31:01.447 --> 31:02.883
He's a lab assistant.

31:03.888 --> 31:06.782
He's a PhD in yeast biology
and he's a lab assistant.

31:06.966 --> 31:10.240
We have only very limited resources

31:10.507 --> 31:12.023
and limited positions

31:12.275 --> 31:14.441
but he's hoping
for a promotion soon.

31:15.188 --> 31:16.983
In the meantime, he rhumbas.

31:21.025 --> 31:23.300
Do you see
the redhead at the bar?

31:23.536 --> 31:24.171
Yeah.

31:24.406 --> 31:27.340
Probably one of the best
microbiologists I've ever worked with.

31:27.457 --> 31:28.252
Really?

31:28.578 --> 31:31.102
She's has a beauty parlor in La Bodeguita.
// FIN PARTIE 2

31:34.566 --> 31:35.482
Enrico!

31:36.647 --> 31:38.251
<i>- Como está usted?
- Muy bien, y tu?</i>

31:38.427 --> 31:39.471
<i>Muy bien. Gracias.</i>

31:40.025 --> 31:42.451
David, I would like to introduce you
to Dr. Enrico Castillo,

31:42.766 --> 31:44.723
- David Sandstrom.
- Doctor...

31:44.988 --> 31:48.082
- It's a great honor to meet you.
- You didn't have to dress up.

31:48.355 --> 31:50.003
Oh, this. Oh, well, I'm sorry.

31:50.165 --> 31:51.622
I just finished work.

31:51.826 --> 31:55.142
I deal blackjack
at the Hotel Nacional.

31:55.976 --> 31:59.020
Eva was telling me
all about your investigation.

31:59.407 --> 32:02.452
- Is it going well?
- So far so good, I guess.

32:02.927 --> 32:06.032
As I understand it
you are looking for a strain

32:06.278 --> 32:08.490
<i>of Xylella fastidiosa bacterium.</i>

32:08.825 --> 32:10.361
A form of it, yes.

32:10.665 --> 32:12.150
And a vector to spread it.

32:12.545 --> 32:14.601
You claim it's a leafhopper. No?

32:14.926 --> 32:16.343
Well, that's what we found in Florida.

32:16.578 --> 32:19.472
The truth is that this leafhopper,

32:19.828 --> 32:22.983
<i>Homalodisca coagulata,
we did have a problem</i>

32:23.277 --> 32:24.483
with in the late 80's.

32:24.758 --> 32:26.752
But I led the team
to eradicate it.

32:27.115 --> 32:29.192
Oh... Well, maybe they're back.

32:30.425 --> 32:32.471
Possible. But, oh!

32:33.177 --> 32:36.073
I have here my report.

32:36.965 --> 32:39.411
We sexually neutered
the insect,

32:40.216 --> 32:42.720
and it was not able
to reproduce

32:42.968 --> 32:45.492
on the island
for over 15 years.

32:45.618 --> 32:47.863
You are looking at
3 years of work.

32:48.287 --> 32:49.703
Well, I'll have a look at it.

32:59.798 --> 33:02.393
Doctor, it was a great honour
and a pleasure to meet you.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.351
Thank you.

33:09.805 --> 33:12.640
<i>That guy worked on the
fastidiosa in the sugar cane?</i>

33:12.946 --> 33:13.751
Yes.

33:15.107 --> 33:17.083
And now he's dealing blackjack?

33:17.477 --> 33:20.923
He has 7 younger brothers
and a sick mother to feed.

33:21.245 --> 33:23.350
This is the only
job he can find.

33:23.556 --> 33:24.552
It's a fucking waste.

33:26.278 --> 33:29.353
Hey, get us a otra cerveza

33:29.568 --> 33:31.850
I understood cerveza. I'll get them.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.980
I have good stuff
from Canada.

33:35.155 --> 33:38.590
<i>Hidden behind the milk.
In the fridge in mi casa.</i>

33:39.026 --> 33:40.962
Ahh. I'll be right back.

33:55.248 --> 33:58.361
Usted es uno de
los cientificos americanos, no?

33:59.517 --> 34:00.722
Excuse me?

34:00.916 --> 34:03.120
You're one of the American scientists?

34:03.245 --> 34:05.290
Investigating
the plague in Florida?

34:06.935 --> 34:10.250
Yes, I mean, no. I'm David Sandstrom.

34:10.605 --> 34:12.062
I'm from Canada.

34:12.366 --> 34:14.760
I am Rose Charringa.

34:15.248 --> 34:17.513
Salvador Charringa's sister.

34:19.246 --> 34:21.442
You're here because of him.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.753
I'm here because of him.

34:26.185 --> 34:27.641
You'd like a cigar?

34:27.764 --> 34:29.830
No thanks, I just had one.

34:31.716 --> 34:34.080
My brother has become

34:34.327 --> 34:36.641
a very important man.

34:37.175 --> 34:38.763
Very successful man.

34:39.235 --> 34:41.483
An orange grove in Florida,

34:41.937 --> 34:44.273
a vineyard in California,

34:45.277 --> 34:48.400
I guess that would be considered
successful to some.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.322
For others it may be

34:51.745 --> 34:54.672
the enjoyment
of a well rolled cigar.

34:59.335 --> 35:01.443
Why didn't you leave?

35:01.745 --> 35:03.263
With your brother?

35:04.815 --> 35:07.992
My family lived
a very privileged life

35:08.525 --> 35:10.601
at the cost
of my countrymen.

35:11.767 --> 35:14.253
Fidel opened
my eyes to that.

35:15.307 --> 35:18.053
My brother closed
his eyes to Fidel.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.743
Do you think, hmm...

35:22.746 --> 35:26.932
Castro communism
made things better?

35:30.055 --> 35:32.683
There was a time when I thought yes,

35:33.196 --> 35:34.832
it was better.

35:35.895 --> 35:37.120
But...

35:39.085 --> 35:41.902
But when things went bad you still stayed.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.093
I could never leave.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.003
Do you have
the letter, David?

35:53.057 --> 35:54.303
David?

36:08.197 --> 36:10.160
His eyes must
never see this.

36:11.546 --> 36:12.950
Why?

36:13.906 --> 36:15.743
Because I won't leave him.

36:17.167 --> 36:18.323
Why?

36:18.728 --> 36:20.683
Because I love him.

36:21.816 --> 36:23.382
And I love you.

36:27.187 --> 36:30.143
- I hate him.
- No, you don't.

36:35.848 --> 36:38.381
I just wanted to be with you.

36:40.758 --> 36:43.011
I just wanted
you to be happy.

36:45.017 --> 36:46.610
David,

36:47.395 --> 36:50.351
30% of life is sadness,

36:50.565 --> 36:53.301
30% of life is happiness,

36:53.468 --> 36:55.370
the rest is
what you make it.

37:00.847 --> 37:02.721
I'm happy.

37:06.818 --> 37:09.320
I spent my life trying to face the struggle,

37:09.748 --> 37:12.032
not to run from it.

37:14.886 --> 37:16.500
Dr. Sandstrom?

37:26.108 --> 37:27.391
Sorry.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.441
My mother died
the other day.

37:36.715 --> 37:38.692
I'm sorry.

37:41.668 --> 37:43.690
She finally got to leave him.

37:48.206 --> 37:50.353
Are you happy you stayed?

37:51.638 --> 37:53.592
This is my home.

38:09.717 --> 38:12.733
Do you remember the last
Christmas we spent together?

38:14.197 --> 38:17.193
Your mom and I
we never used to fight.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.400
But we did that morning.

38:19.858 --> 38:21.550
Language. Memory. Visual.

38:21.928 --> 38:24.040
It's like he is imagining
everything she's saying.

38:24.155 --> 38:25.980
This is fantastic.

38:29.748 --> 38:32.022
At first, we fought about how much onion

38:32.148 --> 38:33.580
to put in the stuffing.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.373
And then we fought about

38:35.498 --> 38:38.800
how she always treated
me like a baby.

38:40.795 --> 38:42.803
And then we fought about how

38:43.917 --> 38:46.273
I never came to see you,

38:48.017 --> 38:50.241
and how I forgot to call.

38:52.106 --> 38:54.363
I forgot call you
on your birthday.

38:56.475 --> 38:59.480
So, I went outside to get some
air and there you were,

39:00.035 --> 39:03.340
sitting in the arm of the big
oak on the lawn.

39:04.247 --> 39:06.631
And you asked
me to go for a run.

39:07.495 --> 39:09.663
It was below freezing,

39:10.297 --> 39:13.121
11:00 a.m. on Christmas morning,

39:15.757 --> 39:18.203
but I went and I got my shoes.

39:18.967 --> 39:21.300
And we ran.

39:32.206 --> 39:34.460
You are very quiet this morning.

39:34.545 --> 39:35.643
Sorry.

39:37.265 --> 39:39.310
I had fun last night.

39:39.596 --> 39:40.750
Me too.

39:41.225 --> 39:43.840
I wish
you would stay longer.

39:44.098 --> 39:47.542
- And maybe say good-bye when you left.
- Sorry about that.

39:48.015 --> 39:50.020
- I guess I--
- It's okay.

39:53.655 --> 39:56.833
So, why was Rose Charringa
at your house last night?

39:58.576 --> 40:00.593
Rose is my mother.

40:03.957 --> 40:08.482
Why did I not tell you
that Salvador Charringa is my uncle ?

40:10.865 --> 40:12.841
Would that have made a difference?

40:14.826 --> 40:16.241
I don't know.

40:18.928 --> 40:21.613
I have no respect for my uncle,

40:21.755 --> 40:24.913
for the things he has done,
for the things he has said.

40:26.358 --> 40:30.220
But I will never let that
come in the way of the truth.

40:31.686 --> 40:33.483
I don't think you would.

40:34.456 --> 40:35.681
Right, ok.

40:35.988 --> 40:38.572
I'll call you after
we take a look. Right.

40:41.796 --> 40:42.701
Well?

40:42.826 --> 40:44.610
So they want us to
take a look at the other 2 labs.

40:44.797 --> 40:47.783
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake. Did you
tell them the fastidiosa wasn't a match?</i>

40:47.968 --> 40:50.563
Yes, and that the leafhopper
could not have come out of Cuba.

40:51.036 --> 40:53.971
All right, so much for working on my tan.

40:59.626 --> 41:02.050
Connor, the Cubans have
been more than cooperative.

41:02.137 --> 41:04.763
Oh, I'm sure they have,
considering what they might be facing.

41:04.846 --> 41:07.282
Or maybe they just don't
have anything to hide.

41:07.476 --> 41:10.073
Caroline, the US military is not
going to stand down

41:10.218 --> 41:12.322
until they
have undeniable proof.

41:12.688 --> 41:14.391
Tell me something:

41:14.486 --> 41:16.980
Have they already made up
their mind to hit Cuba?

41:17.067 --> 41:19.480
Bioterrorism is on everyone's lips down here.

41:19.576 --> 41:21.861
I got Senators
worried about everything

41:21.947 --> 41:24.323
from corn in Iowa
to potatoes in Idaho.

41:24.365 --> 41:26.283
But there's no proof it's bioterrorism,

41:26.327 --> 41:28.911
this could be just a naturally
occurring bacterium.

41:29.146 --> 41:33.000
Get me the proof Caroline,
I'll try to put out fires down here,

41:33.085 --> 41:35.250
but that's not going to stop
the clock from ticking.

41:35.457 --> 41:38.150
Ok, I'll make sure sDavid gets the message.

41:38.315 --> 41:39.700
- Damn.
- What?

41:40.595 --> 41:43.311
The Senate has just called a special session.

41:43.598 --> 41:46.953
They're considering declaring
this an act of war by Cuba.

41:47.188 --> 41:48.743
And if they do?

41:50.077 --> 41:51.983
Forget about any deadlines,

41:52.356 --> 41:54.890
the bombs are going
to start dropping.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.080
Haven't we been here before?

42:03.965 --> 42:07.053
One abandoned lab looks just like the next.

42:08.066 --> 42:11.032
This used to be our genetic
engineering lab.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.900
We did so many things here:

42:13.016 --> 42:15.920
Hybrid sugar cane -
disease resistant -,

42:16.038 --> 42:17.522
tobacco plants

42:17.778 --> 42:19.733
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

42:23.827 --> 42:28.060
You know we had in this lab,
one of the first DNA sequencers.

42:28.205 --> 42:29.741
Really. What happened to it?

42:30.467 --> 42:31.930
I'm not sure.

42:32.057 --> 42:35.770
Probably got traded on
the black market for a tractor.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.960
Or something more practical.

42:48.268 --> 42:49.200
David!

43:00.818 --> 43:02.772
I don't know what this is.

43:04.075 --> 43:05.332
Yeah, well,

43:05.598 --> 43:07.131
let's find out.

43:12.675 --> 43:15.523
What did the neurologist say?

43:15.636 --> 43:19.463
Well, uh,
since Glenn responded to your voice,

43:19.656 --> 43:22.843
he's no longer considered to be
in a persistent vegetative state.

43:23.235 --> 43:26.021
- So he was misdiagnosed?
- That's possible

43:26.168 --> 43:29.782
So he's either minimally conscious, or
he's moved to the spectrum of consciousness.

43:29.925 --> 43:32.312
Right. I mean, we'll never know
exactly what happened,

43:32.428 --> 43:34.380
both those scenarios
aren't uncommon.

43:34.435 --> 43:36.761
But now that we do know that
he's minimally conscious,

43:36.807 --> 43:40.453
we can form a new plan of care.
New tests, towards total emergence.

43:40.615 --> 43:45.103
Ok, total emergence meaning he regains
the ability to move his body at will, right?

43:45.195 --> 43:48.421
- Right. Yes. Plus the ability to speak.
- Ok, how do we encourage him to emerge?

43:48.656 --> 43:51.801
Well we know that he can hear, we need
to test and see if he can understand.

43:51.945 --> 43:54.062
- How?
- We ask him to respond.

44:05.197 --> 44:06.621
Fuck!

44:07.078 --> 44:08.131
David?

44:08.256 --> 44:10.723
Eva, we have either been set up

44:10.867 --> 44:13.043
or we've been lied to since
we got off the airplane.

44:13.185 --> 44:15.491
Because everything matches
to the Florida strain!

44:15.606 --> 44:17.292
Every, goddamn thing.

44:19.866 --> 44:24.541
It's every excuse the Americans
need to turn Cuba into a parking lot.

44:25.765 --> 44:29.802
Do you like horror movies? Yes.

44:32.005 --> 44:33.232
Incredible.

44:33.707 --> 44:36.101
So Simon, what's next?

44:36.917 --> 44:38.470
Brain surgery.

44:38.575 --> 44:41.421
And brain surgery is never easy
on the patient or the patient's family.

44:41.656 --> 44:43.293
Well, if we can't do a MRI

44:43.455 --> 44:46.081
or ask him to respond,
how we gonna know it's working?

44:46.226 --> 44:47.450
He'll emerge.

44:49.355 --> 44:51.873
Owen. What are you doing here?

44:52.075 --> 44:55.241
I got rid of the weed. And now,
the 2 guys who own the weed,

44:55.386 --> 44:57.342
- well, they want to kill me.
- What?

44:58.178 --> 45:00.250
Look I just need a place for a bit.

45:00.516 --> 45:02.472
Carlos, hey! Did you get my cigars yet?

45:02.566 --> 45:05.472
Hey, funny you should ask.
I'm sending them by Air Express.

45:05.938 --> 45:07.521
Ok, really?

45:07.687 --> 45:09.451
These are very special, Mayko, and...

45:09.585 --> 45:11.881
please do not share them
with anyone.

45:12.415 --> 45:14.320
Sandstrom won't bring them back.

45:14.816 --> 45:16.420
I know that, sir.

45:17.717 --> 45:18.921
Holy shit.

45:18.996 --> 45:21.631
<i>And they say Cuba is behind all this...</i>

45:21.895 --> 45:25.402
Eva, I have no idea why
NorBAC would say that.

45:26.016 --> 45:28.150
We need to find out more information

45:28.277 --> 45:30.951
about these Cuban scientists,
before this gets out of hand.

45:31.045 --> 45:34.801
Our decision won't be an easy one and
anything you find would help.

45:34.887 --> 45:37.092
Remember, only you know
the whole story.
