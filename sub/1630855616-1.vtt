WEBVTT

00:31.614 --> 00:33.408
Oh, my gracious.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.160
-Yep.
-How about that?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.787
A&M did it. They just did it.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.250
Here comes Johnny Football.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.504
The Heisman Trophy, for the first time,
has gone to a freshman quarterback.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.465
He is must-watch TV.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.064
Johnny Football!

01:04.147 --> 01:07.108
He's taken on
Rolling Stones, Beatles status.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.158
…brought A&M
back to national prominence.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.745
In the preseason,
hardly anyone knew who Johnny Manziel was.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.376
New trouble for Johnny Manziel.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.254
-…under investigation for assault.
-Manziel has gone into rehab.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.216
The family fears he is spiraling
out of control.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.080
Johnny Football!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.445
-Clear eyes, full hearts…
-Can't lose!

05:28.619 --> 05:30.371
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jonathan… ♪

05:35.084 --> 05:35.960
There he is.

05:37.086 --> 05:37.920
Paul!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.082
Here come the Antlers!

07:15.393 --> 07:16.686
Touchdown, Tivy.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.704
Snap to Manziel.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.248
Looks like he's gonna
take this one to the house!

07:41.085 --> 07:44.255
A 90-yard touchdown
from Johnny Manziel.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.884
It all starts here

07:47.967 --> 07:51.721
and on thousands of football fields
like this all over the country.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.390
It's where the quarterbacks of tomorrow
learn their future skills.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.684
Everybody wants to be
the quarterback.

07:56.767 --> 08:00.646
Nobody's watching the nose tackle except
for the nose tackle's wife and mother.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.874
Great pump fake.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.418
Say goodbye to Vince Young.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.842
Always try to keep the elbow
at least parallel with the shoulder.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.677
As a quarterback,

08:31.761 --> 08:35.264
square your shoulders up with the line
of scrimmage before delivering the ball.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.559
You wanna see the ball secure,
not flopping around.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.151
Manziel. Touchdown, Antlers.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.211
He had seven touchdowns

09:05.294 --> 09:07.838
in the first half
last week against Fredericksburg.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.550
You look at his numbers,
and he has not disappointed it.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.717
He picked up

09:11.801 --> 09:13.803
the Associated Press
Player of the Year award.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.264
Johnny Manziel
certainly lives up to the hype.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.933
Touchdown. Touchdown, Johnny Manziel.

09:19.016 --> 09:23.563
Coming into senior season,
check out these numbers. 3,609 yards.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.855
Seventy-five touchdowns?

09:24.939 --> 09:28.859
I thought that was a typo. I thought
that was for his career, not this season!

10:01.517 --> 10:04.437
It is not a simple thing,
the making of a quarterback.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.399
It is the stuff of which legends are made.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.692
The Big 12 Conference
is about to get smaller.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.654
Texas A&M University gave its notice
to the athletic conference,

10:54.737 --> 10:57.490
said it plans to leave the league
by next July.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.377
For more and more universities
across the country,

11:09.460 --> 11:14.340
success on the football field now equals
a higher profile for the entire school.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.551
A&M is moving towards
a jump to the Southeast Conference

11:17.635 --> 11:21.222
as SEC is home to teams
like Florida, Auburn, and LSU.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.562
Welcome to the SEC.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.449
We're talking about a football program

11:40.533 --> 11:42.618
that's three games over .500
the last nine seasons.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.663
We're not talking about
a national superpower here.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.135
The SEC has
five national championships in a row.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.054
They're going into the toughest league
in the country. We all know that.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.639
And it's the toughest by a long shot.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.520
I wanna welcome Kevin Sumlin
as new head football coach at Texas A&M.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.073
How does this offense
translate going against SEC defense?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.492
Hell, we'll find out. We'll find out.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.755
One of Texas A&M's
potential starting quarterbacks

12:35.838 --> 12:38.299
was arrested early this morning
in Northgate.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.135
Patrol officers say
they saw two men fighting.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.595
One of the two was Manziel.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.319
Steps it outside, nothing doing.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
Manziel just couldn't beat 'em
with his arm.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.730
First down and ten,
Manziel pumps once.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.566
Now he is forced out of the pocket.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.943
He's running, and some of those guys
back there don't know.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.737
Oh, broken tackle. 20.
Cutting back to his left.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.282
He's gonna get in. That's a touchdown.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.500
He got away from that guy.
Now he's gonna throw under duress.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.503
And he made a catch!
Manziel is a magician today.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.006
It's unbelievable.
We're watching him grow up here.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.973
Here's Manziel,
breaks a tackle.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.850
In the end zone! Yeah!

14:52.933 --> 14:57.563
70 to 14. A&M improves to two and one.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.157
Manziel going deep.
It's caught. This may be 80 yards.

15:25.132 --> 15:28.761
He's got the first down.
He's got the end zone. Touchdown!

16:13.639 --> 16:15.766
Rolling right.
He's wide open.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.434
He is gonna get another first down.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.770
He's after the, a--
He's cutting back to his right.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.731
He just scored!
I don't know how he did it.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.281
And the legend of No 2
continues to build.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.521
The Cotton Bowl is dominated by Alabama.

17:02.604 --> 17:06.233
The Crimson Tide of Alabama is
on the flood this New Year's Day.

17:06.316 --> 17:10.446
Alabama wins the inaugural
Southeastern Conference Championship.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.282
Crimson Tide wins
the National Championship.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.160
Alabama. They win the BCS Championship.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.788
Fourteen national championships.
Man, that's pretty much all you gotta say.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.625
What is it
about the Crimson Tide this year,

17:23.709 --> 17:26.837
last year, that's made them
so good under Nick Saban?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.714
You mean the last four years?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.967
Nick Saban is the most dominant
head coach in the college football

17:32.051 --> 17:33.927
and maybe all of American sports.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.808
Does A&M have a chance to win this game?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.935
A&M has as much chance
of beating Alabama

17:42.019 --> 17:43.520
as I do to hit the lottery.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.736
A hundred and one thousand
will fill this place

17:50.819 --> 17:52.112
by the time we kick it off.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.072
Whoo!

18:14.802 --> 18:18.764
Win, win, win…

18:23.393 --> 18:25.687
Manziel takes off again.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.566
Uh-oh. Stiff arm.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.197
Four-man Alabama rush. Got him.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.824
Oh no, they didn't.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.784
-Oh, my gracious.
-Yep.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.661
How about that?

18:44.665 --> 18:47.417
A&M has been unstoppable.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.800
Alabama fans are going,

18:54.883 --> 18:57.219
"I've never seen anything like this
in my life."

19:00.472 --> 19:01.932
Touchdown, Alabama.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.355
Lacy left side. Lacy leaning.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.898
Lacy's in!

19:14.653 --> 19:19.032
And Manziel knows it.
Alabama is still alive.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.258
-He's got Swope.
-My gosh, what a pass!

19:36.341 --> 19:39.595
Swope never broke stride.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.854
Ball wobbles, it's caught!

19:48.937 --> 19:50.314
Touchdown!

19:50.397 --> 19:51.773
Malcome Kennedy.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.037
Let's get this over with.
Right now! Right now!

20:17.341 --> 20:19.927
A&M did it.
They just did it.

20:20.510 --> 20:23.013
Lightning in a bottle in Tuscaloosa.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.224
And did Johnny Football put himself

20:25.307 --> 20:27.935
in position to be a Heisman Trophy winner?

22:14.541 --> 22:17.544
Johnny Manziel is the talk
of the sports world.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.884
Look at this T-shirt right here.
Supporting Johnny. Look.

22:23.967 --> 22:27.095
Texas A&M is looking to profit
from the success of their quarterback.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.724
The team store is selling his jersey
for the first time this season.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.960
What makes this story
so amazing is that, in the preseason,

22:59.044 --> 23:01.380
hardly anyone knew who Johnny Manziel was.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.715
A young man they call Johnny Football.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.301
-Johnny Football?
-Yeah, Johnny Football, Johnny Manziel.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.989
- Here comes Johnny Football.
-There goes Johnny Football.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.617
- Can you say "magic"?
-He's magic.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.965
Adidas has actually run out of
the blank maroon No 2 jerseys.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.759
Manziel's legend grows just as fast.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.933
Sent home from school

23:55.016 --> 23:57.853
with a Johnny Manziel carved
into the back of his head.

24:01.231 --> 24:06.570
Welcome into Johnny Manziel
and Jim Muncy's world of fantasy football.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.573
♪ Johnny Football ♪

24:10.073 --> 24:14.536
♪ You're an angel to us ♪

24:58.663 --> 25:00.248
The winner of this year's Heisman Trophy

25:00.332 --> 25:02.501
will be announced Saturday
right here in New York.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.878
Manziel is considered the favorite.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.797
He'd be the first freshman ever
to win the trophy.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.716
The Heisman Trophy will be awarded

25:09.799 --> 25:11.510
just a few hours from now,

25:11.593 --> 25:14.429
and we are honored
to be joined by the finalists.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.516
This was for all three of you. We got
a couple of seniors here and a freshman.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.227
Does any of that matter anymore
when determining the Heisman?

25:20.310 --> 25:22.395
I'd like to hear from all of you on that.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.856
I don't think so. Um, I think--

25:27.734 --> 25:31.446
Good evening, everyone. I'm Jim Nantz.
We're at the home of the Heisman Trophy,

25:31.530 --> 25:34.616
the most prestigious prize
in all of college sports.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.973
Might this be the year
the final class barrier is broken down

25:58.056 --> 26:01.309
by the voters, a first-ever freshman
to win the Heisman Trophy?

29:08.913 --> 29:10.498
According to one estimate,

29:10.582 --> 29:14.210
Manziel's Heisman
has been worth $37 million

29:14.294 --> 29:16.796
in free publicity for Texas A&M.

29:27.307 --> 29:31.394
The Texas A&M Foundation
raised more than $740 million,

29:31.478 --> 29:35.023
$300 million more
than any other one-year period

29:35.106 --> 29:36.983
in the university's history.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.252
A makeover of Texas-sized proportions.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.171
A&M proposed a renovation plan

29:58.254 --> 30:02.008
that could fit
more than 100,000 people in Kyle Field.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.999
Football is an industry that makes
billions of dollars every year

30:35.083 --> 30:38.336
at both the pro and collegiate levels.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.964
And while professional players
can count on fat paychecks,

30:41.047 --> 30:43.591
college athletes can't make a dime.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.892
Athletes argue the organization
continues to profit off student-athletes

30:52.976 --> 30:54.811
without giving them a fair cut.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.237
The NCAA president testified
that any effort to pay players

31:04.320 --> 31:07.740
would destroy a framework that has been
in place for more than a century.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.243
We provide students
with access to education,

31:10.326 --> 31:14.289
and there's not even a salary to debate.
They're not employees. They're students.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.465
The idea of athletes being paid,

31:24.549 --> 31:27.427
do you think that will ever happen
at the NCAA level?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.804
Not while I'm president of the NCAA.

33:26.587 --> 33:28.506
Not looking good for the Padres.

33:36.514 --> 33:40.268
How does a college kid get
courtside seats? They are expensive seats.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.656
Please welcome Johnny Manziel!

33:53.740 --> 33:57.243
He's one of your boys, clearly.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.828
Johnny's like one of the best guys,

33:58.911 --> 34:01.497
and I feel like our friendship
will last for… for a very long time.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.404
Texas A&M star quarterback,

35:15.488 --> 35:17.782
Johnny Manziel,
has come under scrutiny this week.

35:17.865 --> 35:20.618
Accused of signing
sports memorabilia for money.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.052
There may be two other questionable
autograph-signing sessions.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.472
There's growing concern
Johnny Manziel may not even be in uniform…

35:49.188 --> 35:52.859
Johnny Football could lose
part of his eligibility, if not all.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.861
Is this the end for Manziel?

37:07.391 --> 37:08.517
I've been blessed

37:08.601 --> 37:10.686
with family members
that have had these opportunities,

37:10.770 --> 37:12.647
and I've always been able to do this.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.654
What's interesting is here's a kid
who doesn't need money.

37:19.737 --> 37:20.947
He comes from oil money.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.366
A kid who came from oil money.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.791
Well, Johnny Football suspended
for half a game.

37:31.874 --> 37:35.419
The NCAA says there is no evidence
that Manziel took money,

37:35.503 --> 37:39.674
but he still violated the rules
by signing certain photographs.

37:52.979 --> 37:56.816
The last time the reigning Heisman Trophy
winner returned to play in the SEC

37:56.899 --> 37:59.110
was Tim Tebow back in 2007.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.403
Now, it's this man's turn.

38:00.486 --> 38:03.656
The one person that everybody
had their eyes on earlier this morning

38:03.739 --> 38:05.574
was Johnny Football.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.074
Manziel caught a lot of heat
from the media

38:47.158 --> 38:49.201
after leaving the Manning Passing Academy.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.704
Some reports say Manziel was hungover
and missed camp.

38:51.787 --> 38:53.414
What happened on the weekend?

38:53.497 --> 38:55.541
Um, nothing…
nothing more than I overslept.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.548
Early Sunday morning,
Manziel posted a quote,

39:08.179 --> 39:12.641
Manziel was reportedly quickly
and harshly removed from a frat party.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.268
I like to have fun in my life.

39:14.352 --> 39:18.105
I like to live my life to the fullest,
and if that upsets some people, I'm sorry.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.512
Um, nobody's really ever been
in this situation.

39:49.595 --> 39:54.266
We've been very clear with Johnny
and his family about the dos and don'ts,

39:54.350 --> 39:57.228
but, um, there's not a perfect person
in this room.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.365
So the suspension

40:09.448 --> 40:13.452
that many around college football
felt was just a joke is now history,

40:13.536 --> 40:16.122
and Johnny Manziel
is a college football player again.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.875
Johnny! Johnny!
Johnny! Johnny!

40:19.959 --> 40:22.211
In for his first snap of 2013.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.547
And Manziel takes off.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.465
There goes Johnny Football!

40:27.550 --> 40:30.177
That's why they love him
here in College Station.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.471
Here's his other standard move
after a touchdown.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.021
Show me the money, baby!

40:41.105 --> 40:42.356
This season started

40:42.440 --> 40:44.608
with enormous expectations
for Johnny Manziel.

40:44.692 --> 40:48.154
Perhaps his second Heisman Trophy,
SEC National Championship.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.073
Third of the half for Johnny Football.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.034
Following the touchdown,
unsportsmanlike conduct,

40:54.118 --> 40:57.121
No 2 of the offense, 15-yard penalty…

41:00.124 --> 41:02.835
That's not okay,
and obviously, I addressed that

41:02.918 --> 41:04.795
on the sideline right after the play.

41:08.757 --> 41:12.344
There is a code of conduct
for the reigning Heisman winner,

41:12.428 --> 41:14.305
and he violated it once again.

41:22.396 --> 41:25.024
This guy's been partying since
he stepped into College Station,

41:25.107 --> 41:26.650
so I think he's just being himself.

41:26.734 --> 41:31.030
Can college football
take three more years of Johnny Football?

41:31.113 --> 41:34.033
Say whatever you want
about Johnny Manziel,

41:34.116 --> 41:37.703
if you can watch one player
in college football, you wanna watch him.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.507
Biggest question involving
the former Heisman winner

41:49.590 --> 41:51.550
is whether he should head to the pros

41:51.634 --> 41:54.136
while his draft stock
is looking so bright.

42:11.570 --> 42:14.114
Got a feeling
Johnny Manziel's a little frustrated.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.290
There's a reaction

42:23.374 --> 42:25.543
on the sidelines
from A&M's leader, Johnny Manziel.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.836
The thing that makes him
who he is,

42:27.920 --> 42:30.548
is his passion and emotion.

42:32.174 --> 42:35.177
It's our challenge
to try to keep that energy positive.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.471
Johnny Manziel just can't help himself.

42:37.555 --> 42:41.475
You draw the line in the sand,
he steps over that line.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.770
Let's remember this.
This problem did not happen last year.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.480
Turn the fuck up!

42:46.564 --> 42:47.523
Last week was one

42:47.606 --> 42:50.192
of his most disappointing games
since he's been at Texas A&M.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.282
And the ovation
for Johnny Manziel

42:57.074 --> 43:01.662
along with these seniors
as they close the door on Kyle Field.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.108
Johnny Manziel made it official today,
no surprise,

43:31.191 --> 43:34.153
announcing he's gonna leave college
to enter the NFL draft.

43:34.236 --> 43:37.448
The big question,
"Where will Manziel go in the draft?"

45:54.960 --> 45:57.337
He does not belong in the top 25.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.507
He may get a bump to second round.
He's not getting in the first round.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.099
There's things Johnny's gotta answer
moving forward

46:09.183 --> 46:11.101
to be a quarterback and be a leader.

46:20.861 --> 46:21.987
Come right back.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.214
-So how's the day been?
-It's been really good.

48:46.298 --> 48:50.052
A little early morning, but we're kinda
in the mood now, in the swing of things.

49:24.002 --> 49:25.253
What was that process like?

49:25.337 --> 49:28.840
It was really cool to see… to see a bunch
of these coaches I've seen on TV and…

49:53.031 --> 49:55.701
It was a pro day
done the Johnny Manziel way.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.500
A huge crowd
at College Station.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.711
George and Barbara Bush even showing up.

50:05.794 --> 50:08.463
Manziel's performance
receiving universal praise.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.219
Most experts agree
he's gonna be a top-ten pick.

50:14.302 --> 50:15.637
He'll be a top-ten pick.

50:24.354 --> 50:26.815
Will the Houston Texans
pick Johnny Manziel first?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.611
All around Houston,

50:31.695 --> 50:34.656
billboards are up
to bring Johnny Football back to Texas.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.782
People are talking first pick overall
or a top ten.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.258
Welcome indeed

52:16.341 --> 52:18.510
to New York City, to Radio City Music Hall

52:18.593 --> 52:23.348
where, tonight, we find out
where Johnny Manziel will be playing…

52:30.939 --> 52:34.776
With the first pick in the 2014 NFL draft,

52:35.402 --> 52:39.447
the Houston Texans
select Jadeveon Clowney.

52:45.579 --> 52:48.915
The Jacksonville Jaguars
select Blake Bortles.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.877
The first quarterback

52:51.960 --> 52:54.963
of this draft selected
is not Johnny Manziel.

52:58.633 --> 52:59.634
What happens

52:59.718 --> 53:02.179
when Jerry Jones gets the chance
to take Johnny Football?

53:06.933 --> 53:10.896
If they take Johnny Manziel
right now, this place is gonna explode.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.398
The Dallas Cowboys select

53:13.481 --> 53:17.110
Zack Martin, guard, Notre Dame.

53:22.616 --> 53:27.871
Snubbed by team
after team after team after team.

53:46.139 --> 53:49.142
-Browns at 26 just moved up to 22.
- Johnny!

53:49.226 --> 53:53.313
And you can hear the chant
in the Radio City Music Hall for Johnny.

53:53.855 --> 53:55.440
Ha ha ha!

53:57.859 --> 53:59.527
With the 22nd pick,

53:59.611 --> 54:01.321
the Cleveland Browns select

54:01.404 --> 54:02.781
Johnny Manziel,

54:03.740 --> 54:05.408
quarterback, Texas A&M.

54:06.201 --> 54:07.535
My goodness.

54:12.499 --> 54:15.919
Right there,
is the hope for the city of Cleveland.

54:33.144 --> 54:37.357
The Browns finally get
the face of their franchise.

55:04.759 --> 55:07.304
Well, the news is
Johnny Manziel is having

55:07.387 --> 55:09.389
a ripple effect across Browns Nation.

55:09.472 --> 55:12.976
- Johnny!
- Whoa!

55:26.489 --> 55:27.824
You know, every day that passes,

55:27.907 --> 55:31.202
every week that goes by is…
is only a positive thing for me.

57:26.151 --> 57:28.361
It's been life for so long now.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.448
I can't really think back
to the days of how it was

57:31.531 --> 57:34.701
when I didn't have people tweeting
or taking pictures of wherever I was.

57:43.334 --> 57:46.504
…Manziel,
and Manziel is buried.

57:46.588 --> 57:48.840
And there's your first cash sign.

57:48.923 --> 57:51.092
This thing of the, you know,
show me the money.

57:51.176 --> 57:55.555
Every time they sack him,
the defensemen do that right in his face.

57:55.638 --> 57:57.557
He had a terrible start in the NFL.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.725
It was horrific…

57:58.808 --> 58:01.936
Nothing like
the Johnny Football we saw at Texas A&M.

58:13.031 --> 58:15.825
Stories surfaced about him
being late for team meetings.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.286
He was demoted
to third-string quarterback.

58:18.369 --> 58:21.623
A high-price, first-round draft pick
heading in the wrong direction.

58:21.706 --> 58:22.874
Yeah, I…

58:24.000 --> 58:27.003
You know, I made the decision
to go out on Friday night.

58:34.719 --> 58:37.764
When he turned pro,
the partying became more public.

58:37.847 --> 58:39.349
-I can't hear.
-He can't hear you.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.601
There's too much money… in my… hand.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.771
Nothing that I'm doing
on the weekends is affecting my job.

58:44.854 --> 58:47.649
Nothing on the weekends that I'm doing,
um, is hopefully hurting

58:47.732 --> 58:49.275
any of my teammates in my locker room.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.999
He just keeps putting himself
in situations

59:05.083 --> 59:06.960
where he's getting himself in trouble.

59:07.043 --> 59:09.963
That guy knows
that he represents more than himself

59:10.046 --> 59:11.506
and has issues off the field.

59:11.589 --> 59:12.924
It's… It is frustrating.

59:20.932 --> 59:24.269
Johnny Football,
the big bust of a rookie last year,

59:24.352 --> 59:26.604
entered a treatment program on Wednesday.

59:31.234 --> 59:35.154
He's been somewhat of a legend,
and perhaps to his own peril here.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.546
When he returned
to the team after ten weeks of rehab,

59:51.629 --> 59:54.424
he looked and sounded like a changed man.

59:54.507 --> 59:58.303
I'm gonna say "Loser in life."
Can't get out of it.

59:58.386 --> 01:00:01.222
The hype and everything is
a little bit tempered and a little down,

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.433
and that, for me, is a good thing.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.992
Remember, he went to rehab,
not supposed to drink.

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.161
Drank, got into a fight
with his girlfriend.

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:26.456
Both Manziel and the woman
told police they had been drinking.

01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:28.124
No charges were filed.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.557
It sounded a little cuckoo,

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:48.102
but he had the wig on,
there was a fake mustache involved.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.130
Johnny Football is now looking
for another team this morning.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.091
The Cleveland Browns cutting ties

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.802
with Johnny Manziel
and his bad-boy behavior.

01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.095
There is no future

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.138
for Johnny Manziel
with the Cleveland Browns,

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.308
certainly not anymore,
as the Browns have finally realized.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.268
Manziel is not reachable.

01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:36.859
One of the biggest busts
in NFL history.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:41.489
"Tiny," "selfish," "undisciplined,"
"immature," "sort of a brat."

01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:44.867
Johnny Manziel arrived
as the future of Cleveland football,

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.995
and now he will soon leave
as an embarrassment.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:05.805
Dallas police say

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.682
they are examining
hotel surveillance video

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:12.395
showing an encounter between Manziel
and his ex-girlfriend, Colleen Crowley.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:15.231
Crowley said Manziel
led her down a back stairway,

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:16.941
and that she told the valet,

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:20.236
"Please don't let him take me.
I'm scared for my life."

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:41.299
Colleen Crowley has obtained
a protective order from a judge in Texas

01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:44.886
that will keep Johnny Manziel
away from her for two years.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.436
Did you apologize for what happened?

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.646
What about rehab, Johnny?
Gonna go to rehab?

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.571
Friends and family are concerned.
Everything going well?

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:05.698
My friends and family are all right.
They're with me.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:21.923
His dad says Manziel
refused rehab twice in the past week.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:32.058
Even his agent,
Erik Burkhardt, is dumping Manziel.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.887
- Johnny, got anything you wanna say?
- Johnny Football. How's it going?

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:33.327
The money and the fame
and the criticism and the social media

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:35.204
it is eating him alive.
