WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.105
DAVE GOT CAUGHT.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.037
YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME
AND YOU'RE LIVING IN FAIRVIEW.

00:06.037 --> 00:08.179
IT'S NOT HEALTHY OR SAFE.

00:08.179 --> 00:09.640
GABY GOT LEVERAGE.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.682
(Carlos) I'M GETTING
THAT BONUS AFTER ALL.

00:11.682 --> 00:14.785
SO, BRAD, WHAT SORT OF BONUS
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

00:14.785 --> 00:17.088
KATHERINE DROPPED A BOMB.
 MIKE'S MOVING IN HERE.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.290
WHAT?
 TOM CALLED IT QUITS.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.122
IF WE'RE GONNA SELL
THIS PLACE,

00:21.122 --> 00:25.496
WE SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW
EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH.
 AND BREE GOT HONEST...

00:25.496 --> 00:28.329
YOU'RE PAID BASED
ON YOUR CONTRIBUTION.
 YOU'RE SAYING I'M WORTHLESS.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.432
NO, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'RE WORTH... LESS.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.605
WHICH RESULTED
IN SOME STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:41.112 --> 00:43.644
(Mary Alice)
EVERYONE WHO MET ORSON HODGE

00:43.644 --> 00:47.478
KNEW HE BELIEVED
IN BEING POLITE.

00:47.478 --> 00:50.481
HE GREETED HIS NEIGHBORS
EACH DAY WITH A SUNNY...

00:50.481 --> 00:53.454
GOOD MORNING.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.387
HE OPENED DOORS FOR YOUNG WOMEN
WITH A GALLANT...

00:56.387 --> 00:58.129
ALLOW ME.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.164
IF HE BUMPED INTO A STRANGER
ON THE STREET...
 OH!

01:03.164 --> 01:06.537
HE'D CHEERFULLY SAY...
 I BEG YOUR PARDON.

01:06.537 --> 01:11.142
AND IF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS
WAS HAVING A HARD TIME,

01:11.142 --> 01:14.575
ORSON WAS THE FIRST TO SAY...
 YOU NEED SOME HELP THERE?

01:14.575 --> 01:18.209
WHETHER HIS FRIEND
WANTED HIS HELP OR NOT.

01:18.209 --> 01:19.450
ORSON.

01:19.450 --> 01:21.712
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:21.712 --> 01:23.854
WELL, I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE,

01:23.854 --> 01:26.287
AND I THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE A HAND.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.159
I'M GOOD. THANKS.

01:30.361 --> 01:34.225
OH! (chuckles)
WOW. THIS IS CHARMING.

01:34.225 --> 01:36.767
OH, IT'S A SALT SHAKER
MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME.

01:36.767 --> 01:39.130
USED TO DISPLAY IT
ON THE SHELF.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.871
HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR IT?

01:40.871 --> 01:42.573
IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

01:42.573 --> 01:45.136
EVERYTHING IN THAT BOX IS
STUFF I'M TAKING WITH ME.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.607
OH. OKAY.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.539
JUST TRYING TO HELP OUT.

01:48.539 --> 01:51.242
I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT DAY,

01:51.242 --> 01:53.244
AND I THINK I, OF ALL PEOPLE,

01:53.244 --> 01:55.886
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

01:55.886 --> 01:58.619
WHY YOU "OF ALL PEOPLE"?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.691
WELL, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

02:00.691 --> 02:02.823
TO HAVE YOUR LIVELIHOOD
SUDDENLY VANISH.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.825
REMEMBER,
I USED TO BE A DENTIST.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.198
OH. RIGHT.

02:07.198 --> 02:08.799
RIGHT.

02:08.799 --> 02:13.864
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT
 REALLY THE SAME, IS IT?

02:13.864 --> 02:17.838
WHAT'S NOT?
 MY BUSINESS STARTED GOING SOUTH
BECAUSE OF A BAD ECONOMY.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
IT GOT WORSE WHEN MY SON

02:19.840 --> 02:21.842
WAS ACCUSED OF A CRIME
THAT HE DIDN'T COMMIT,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.315
BUT YOU LOST YOUR LICENSE
BECAUSE YOU WENT TO PRISON

02:24.315 --> 02:27.318
FOR A CRIME YOU DID COMMIT.

02:27.318 --> 02:29.780
WHY ARE YOU BEING THIS WAY?

02:29.780 --> 02:32.553
BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO ME IS UNFAIR.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.356
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WAS...
 JUSTICE?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.358
YEAH, AND TO COMPARE
MY SITUATION WITH YOURS,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.360
ON A DAY LIKE THIS,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.363
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT'S A LITTLE INSULTING.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.735
THEN I APOLOGIZE.

02:44.735 --> 02:47.238
(sighs)
 MY INTENTION WAS
NEVER TO INSULT YOU.

02:47.238 --> 02:50.371
I WANTED TO SUPPORT YOU
IN YOUR--IN YOUR HOUR OF NEED.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.844
UH-HUH. UM, VULTURES
ARE STARTING TO ARRIVE.

02:53.844 --> 02:56.247
(chuckles)
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT, THEN.

02:56.247 --> 02:59.179
(indistinct conversations)

02:59.179 --> 03:02.353
YES,
EVERYONE WHO MET ORSON HODGE

03:02.353 --> 03:05.756
KNEW HE BELIEVED
IN BEING POLITE.

03:05.756 --> 03:07.918
WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS

03:07.918 --> 03:10.391
THAT HE ALSO BELIEVED

03:10.391 --> 03:13.193
IN PUNISHING THOSE WHO WEREN'T.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.608
THE DAY AFTER MIKE DELFINO

03:27.608 --> 03:29.710
MOVED IN
WITH KATHERINE MAYFAIR,

03:29.710 --> 03:33.884
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE
TO SHARE HER HAPPINESS,

03:33.884 --> 03:37.888
SO SHE DECIDED TO THROW
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY

03:37.888 --> 03:40.321
FOR HER FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

03:42.293 --> 03:46.957
BUT FROM THE MOMENT THE FIRST
INVITATION WAS DELIVERED,

03:46.957 --> 03:50.801
HER FRIENDS
BEGAN MAKING ASSUMPTIONS

03:50.801 --> 03:54.805
ABOUT THOSE
WHO HAD BEEN INVITED...

03:54.805 --> 03:56.937
AND ABOUT THOSE WHO HADN'T.

03:56.937 --> 04:00.010
I KNOW IT'S LATE NOTICE,
BUT I DO HOPE

04:00.010 --> 04:03.544
YOU'LL ALL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.
 NOW DOES THIS REALLY MEAN
NO GIFTS,

04:03.544 --> 04:06.016
OR IS IT LIKE
WHEN GABY SAYS "NO GIFTS"

04:06.016 --> 04:09.820
AND SHE MEANS NO CHEAP GIFTS?
 YOU KNOW, KATHERINE,
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP,

04:09.820 --> 04:12.553
I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO MAKE MY FAM--
 SHH!

04:12.553 --> 04:16.026
HEY, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

04:16.026 --> 04:18.789
THE FEDERAL DEFICIT.

04:18.789 --> 04:21.031
WHOO! THAT SUCKER'S BIG!

04:22.533 --> 04:26.697
ACTUALLY, SUSAN, WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT MY HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

04:26.697 --> 04:30.471
OH, YEAH. I'M SO EXCITED.
YOU GOT MY R.S.V.P., RIGHT?

04:30.471 --> 04:33.304
YES. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE COMING.
OH, UM, BY THE WAY,

04:33.304 --> 04:36.707
CAN YOU BRING
YOUR BLUE PUNCH BOWL?
 ABSOLUTELY.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED?

04:36.707 --> 04:39.310
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

04:39.310 --> 04:41.512
WHY ISN'T HAIR BEING PULLED?

04:41.512 --> 04:43.484
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

04:43.484 --> 04:46.317
UM, LET'S SEE.
SHE'S SHACKING UP WITH YOUR EX?

04:46.317 --> 04:49.320
SOMETHING WHICH, WHEN I DO IT,
I GET AN ANGRY MOB

04:49.320 --> 04:52.393
ON MY FRONT LAWN.
 I MEAN,
LET'S BE HONEST, SUSAN.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.395
YOU WEREN'T EXACTLY
OVER THE MOON

04:54.395 --> 04:57.998
WHEN YOU HEARD THEY WERE
GONNA LIVE TOGETHER.
 WELL, YES,
I WAS UPSET AT FIRST.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.932
BUT, YOU KNOW, MIKE WAS GONNA
BE WITH SOMEONE EVENTUALLY,

05:01.932 --> 05:04.805
AND I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY
THAT IT WAS SOMEONE, WHO,

05:04.805 --> 05:08.308
AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE,
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY TRUE FRIEND.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.711
SUSAN, THAT'S VERY SWEET.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.042
AND ADMIRABLE.

05:12.042 --> 05:14.815
AND ABNORMAL.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.918
HEY, GABY, REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS WITH CARLOS?
 SHUT IT, BITCH.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.991
SEE? THAT'S NORMAL.

05:20.991 --> 05:23.994
(indistinct conversations)

05:28.699 --> 05:31.962
I'LL GIVE YOU...
$6,000 FOR IT.

05:31.962 --> 05:34.034
WHAT?
IT'S A $12,000 OVEN.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.036
THERE'S A DENT IN THE DOOR.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.909
NOT A DENT. A FIST PRINT.

05:38.909 --> 05:41.442
MY HUSBAND'S BEEN
A LITTLE FRUSTRATED LATELY.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.943
ON THE PLUS SIDE,

05:42.943 --> 05:45.075
IT MATCHES THE SHOE PRINT
ON THE DISHWASHER.

05:45.075 --> 05:47.478
(chuckles)
 $6,200--TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

05:47.478 --> 05:49.950
(sighs, under breath)
YI, YI, YI, YI.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.822
(normal voice)
FINE. CONGRATULATIONS.

05:51.822 --> 05:54.755
YOU JUST STOLE A PIZZA OVEN.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.858
HEY.
 HEY.
I GOT $6,200 FOR THE OVEN.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.860
WHAT?! THAT GUY IS
RIPPING US OFF.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.062
YEAH, WELL, PUTTING
AN "EVERYTHING MUST GO" SIGN

06:02.062 --> 06:04.765
KIND OF ERODED
OUR BARGAINING POSITION.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.767
HOW ARE WE DOING
ON THE OTHER STUFF?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.769
WELL, BY THE END OF THE DAY,

06:08.769 --> 06:11.101
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PAY OFF OUR CREDITORS,

06:11.101 --> 06:14.104
GIVE BREE BACK
THE $20,000 THAT WE OWE HER

06:14.104 --> 06:16.477
AND HAVE ENOUGH
TO LIVE ON FOR...

06:16.477 --> 06:18.148
45 MINUTES.

06:18.148 --> 06:21.151
FORGET I ASKED. I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW.
 OHH.

06:21.151 --> 06:24.815
JUST...
 LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
A CRAPPY DAY FOR YOU,

06:24.815 --> 06:26.817
BUT WE NEED TO START THINKING

06:26.817 --> 06:30.661
ABOUT WHAT OUR PLANS ARE
GOING TO BE.
 I TOLD YOU,
I'M GONNA GET A JOB.

06:30.661 --> 06:32.663
AND THAT IS SO GREAT.
 (sighs)

06:32.663 --> 06:35.666
SO WHEN DO YOU THINK
THAT GREAT THING MIGHT HAPPEN?
 LYNETTE, DON'T.

06:35.666 --> 06:39.570
IT'S TAKEN EVERYTHING I GOT
NOT TO LOSE IT RIGHT NOW.
 (whispers) SORRY.

06:39.570 --> 06:41.532
YOU HONESTLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET $200

06:41.532 --> 06:43.804
FOR THAT CAPPUCCINO MACHINE?
I'LL GIVE YOU $50.

06:43.804 --> 06:48.008
50 BUCKS?! ARE YOU--
 YOU--AH. HEY.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.081
I THINK YOU BETTER STOP
WITH THE BARGAIN HUNTING

06:51.081 --> 06:53.083
UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR FACE

06:53.083 --> 06:55.746
TO MATCH THE OVEN
AND THE DISHWASHER.

06:57.748 --> 07:00.991
HEY, GUYS!

07:00.991 --> 07:02.993
(lowered voice) WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY DOING HERE?

07:02.993 --> 07:04.995
THEY HAD THEATER TICKETS,
AND THEIR SITTER CANCELED.

07:04.995 --> 07:07.998
WE'RE ONLY GONNA WATCH
THEIR KIDS FOR A COUPLE HOURS.
 GOOD IDEA, GABY.

07:07.998 --> 07:10.130
WE'RE HELPING THE SLIMEBALL
CHEAT ON HIS WIFE.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.463
WHY NOT BABYSIT FOR HIM, TOO?
 SHH. HI!

07:12.463 --> 07:14.965
OH, YOU GUYS ARE ANGELS
FOR DOING THIS.

07:14.965 --> 07:17.908
WELL, WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?
 SPEAKING OF WHICH,

07:17.908 --> 07:20.110
THANKS FOR HOOKING BRAD UP
WITH HIS NEW GIRL.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.442
UH, SHAYLA, RIGHT?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.915
YOU KNOW, THAT HAIRSTYLIST
YOU RECOMMENDED--

07:24.915 --> 07:27.147
UH, I WAS AT THE MALL
MAKING AN APPOINTMENT,

07:27.147 --> 07:29.149
AND MARIA WALKED BY.

07:29.149 --> 07:33.123
OH, THAT SHAYLA. (chuckles)
 HOW MANY SHAYLAS DO YOU KNOW?
(chuckles)

07:33.123 --> 07:34.825
TWO. TWO.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.827
THERE'S, UH,
SHAYLA THE HAIRSTYLIST

07:36.827 --> 07:38.989
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS OTHER SHAYLA I KNOW

07:38.989 --> 07:41.862
WHO'S A HOME-WRECKING WHORE.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.865
HEY, CARLOS. UH, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE, UH, MARIA AND THE KIDS

07:44.865 --> 07:47.868
INSIDE AND INTRODUCE THEM
TO THE GIRLS?
 COME ON, GUYS.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.640
COME ON IN.
 ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

07:52.102 --> 07:54.945
YOU'RE USING ME
AS AN ALIBI NOW?

07:54.945 --> 07:57.508
I PAID YOU 30 GRAND.
I WANT MY MONEY'S WORTH.

07:57.508 --> 08:00.681
AND BY THE WAY, YOUR TENNIS GAME
WITH MARIA TOMORROW--

08:00.681 --> 08:04.054
YOU NEED TO MOVE IT TO NOON.
 WHY? SO YOU CAN GO GET
ANOTHER "HAIRCUT"?

08:04.054 --> 08:06.517
SHAYLA'S GOT
A COUPLE HOURS OFF,

08:06.517 --> 08:09.520
AND I WANT TO SPEND 'EM
WITH HER.
 WELL, BRADLEY,
WE ALL WANT THINGS.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.522
FOR INSTANCE,
I WOULD LIKE CARLOS

08:11.522 --> 08:15.065
TO HAVE A WEEK OFF
NEXT MONTH.
 (scoffs) IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S OUR BUSIEST TIME.

08:15.065 --> 08:18.899
COME ON, BRAD.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.172
OH, GABY, WE'RE STILL ON
FOR TENNIS TOMORROW, RIGHT?

08:22.172 --> 08:23.173
4:00?

08:23.173 --> 08:27.037
4:00? LET ME THINK. UH...

08:27.037 --> 08:29.980
UM...

08:31.612 --> 08:33.212
(mouths words)

08:33.212 --> 08:37.087
ACTUALLY, NOON WOULD BE BETTER
FOR ME. COULD YOU DO NOON?

08:37.087 --> 08:40.090
OH, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH BRAD.

08:40.090 --> 08:41.552
DO YOU MIND, SWEETIE?

08:41.552 --> 08:43.554
WELL, I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT,

08:43.554 --> 08:45.656
BUT, UH... GO AHEAD.
YOU GIRLS HAVE FUN.

08:45.656 --> 08:48.929
(chuckles) LISTEN TO HIM.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.932
(chuckles) NOPE.
HE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED.

08:59.169 --> 09:01.111
(Bree sighs)

09:02.813 --> 09:04.815
MY, WHAT AN INTERESTING
COAT HANGER.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.817
IT'S SHAPED LIKE A SOFA.

09:06.817 --> 09:09.119
PLEASE PUT IT IN THE CLOSET.

09:09.119 --> 09:11.051
SORRY, DARLING.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.154
(hums)

09:17.628 --> 09:19.289
ORSON?

09:19.289 --> 09:23.063
WHY DO YOU HAVE A SALT SHAKER
FROM SCAVO'S PIZZERIA?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.865
OH.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.598
I STOPPED BY TO EXPRESS
MY SYMPATHIES WITH TOM,

09:27.598 --> 09:29.199
AND I-I REMEMBER
L-LOOKING AT IT,

09:29.199 --> 09:32.943
AND I-I GUESS I ABSENTMINDEDLY
PUT IT IN MY POCKET.

09:32.943 --> 09:35.075
WELL, TAKE IT BACK NOW.
THEY'RE LIQUIDATING,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.177
AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED
EVERY PENNY THEY CAN GET.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.078
(Italian accent) MA...

09:38.078 --> 09:40.080
I WANT TO STAY HERE
WITH YOU.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.913
ME NO LIKE-A THE SCAVOS
SO MUCH-A.

09:44.314 --> 09:45.315
NO?

09:45.315 --> 09:46.316
NO.

09:46.316 --> 09:48.859
(normal voice) OH. VERY WELL.

09:48.859 --> 09:52.022
THOUGH I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD
TO GOING DOWN THERE AGAIN.
 REALLY?

09:52.022 --> 09:54.865
YES. I ONLY WENT DOWN THERE
TO COMMISERATE,

09:54.865 --> 09:58.228
AND HE WAS VERY DISMISSIVE.
 TOM HAS A LOT ON HIS MIND.
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

09:58.228 --> 10:02.032
YOU WEREN'T THERE, BREE.
HE WAS DOWNRIGHT RUDE.

10:02.032 --> 10:05.135
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD SERVE HIM
RIGHT IF I KEPT THIS.

10:05.135 --> 10:06.637
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

10:06.637 --> 10:09.139
TOM'S RUDENESS DOES NOT
GIVE YOU LICENSE TO STEAL.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.841
RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY.

10:10.841 --> 10:13.183
(Italian accent) MA, YOU--
YOU SUCH A PRETTY GIRL.

10:13.183 --> 10:16.146
I WANNA LIVE-A HERE WITH YOU.
MWAH. MWAH.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.748
HMM?

10:22.653 --> 10:23.894
HEY.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.956
OH, GREAT.
YOU FOUND THE PUNCH BOWL.

10:25.956 --> 10:27.858
WASHED, CLEANED, READY TO GO.

10:27.858 --> 10:31.101
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.
MIKE'S STILL UNPACKING.

10:31.101 --> 10:34.705
HEY, DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP THAT
ANTLER CHANDELIER OUT OF HERE?

10:34.705 --> 10:36.737
YEAH. THAT WENT
RIGHT TO THE GARAGE.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.739
THE TOUGH ONE
WAS THE FRAMED TOWEL

10:38.739 --> 10:40.811
WITH SOME FOOTBALL GUY'S SWEAT
ON IT.

10:40.811 --> 10:43.343
THAT "FOOTBALL GUY" IS
PEYTON MANNING.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.176
YOU WOULD DO WELL
TO LEARN THAT NAME.
 AH.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.820
OH. WOW.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.222
OH, NOW THAT I REALLY LOVE.

10:52.222 --> 10:54.755
I ALMOST COULDN'T BELIEVE
HE HAD SOMETHING THAT NICE.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.657
THANK YOU.
 FOR WHAT?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.790
I PAINTED IT.
IT WAS A GIFT FOR HIM.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.192
REALLY?

11:03.894 --> 11:07.137
YOU PAINTED THAT.
HE DIDN'T MENTION IT.

11:07.137 --> 11:10.941
YEAH. IT WAS A LITTLE BEACH
WE WENT TO FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

11:10.941 --> 11:13.944
UH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
MIKE LOVES THE OCEAN.

11:13.944 --> 11:16.146
(chuckles) YEAH.

11:16.146 --> 11:19.850
NOW I CAN SEE IT EVERY DAY.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.982
ANYWAY, UM, CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE PARTY.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.214
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
(laughs)

11:24.214 --> 11:26.056
YEP.

11:42.773 --> 11:44.204
(sighs)

11:44.204 --> 11:46.907
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THIS. IT MUST BE SO HARD.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.910
THE HARD PART WAS WHEN MY FRIEND
TRIED TO HELP ME WITH A LOAN,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.242
AND I THANKED HER
BY BECOMING A LUNATIC

11:52.242 --> 11:53.784
AND DENTING HER CAR.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.786
NOW THAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP,

11:55.786 --> 11:58.248
LYNETTE, I'VE BEEN FEELING
JUST AWFUL ABOUT THE WAY

11:58.248 --> 12:00.250
I TOOK OVER YOUR RESTAURANT
AND INSULTED YOU

12:00.250 --> 12:02.452
AND... (sighs)
WHAT CAN I SAY?

12:02.452 --> 12:04.454
I THINK WE HAVE
THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP

12:04.454 --> 12:06.456
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

12:06.456 --> 12:09.299
LET'S JUST HUG AND MOVE ON.

12:09.299 --> 12:12.102
OKAY? (laughs)
 (laughs)

12:12.102 --> 12:16.336
OH. HOW'S TOM HOLDING UP?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.238
HE'S DOING GREAT.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.112
ISN'T IT NOON?

12:22.112 --> 12:24.144
YEAH. HE'S UP EARLY TODAY.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.249
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING NEXT.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
(sighs) MAYBE I CAN HELP.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.254
MY PUBLISHER IS THINKING ABOUT
DOING HIS ADVERTISING IN-HOUSE,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.486
AND HE'S BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE.

12:36.486 --> 12:38.358
SERIOUSLY?
 YEAH.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.360
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.263
AND IF HE GETS THE JOB,
YOU CAN ACTUALLY CASH THE CHECK.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.965
I TELL YOU WHAT.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
I WILL INVITE BRUCE
OVER FOR DINNER,

12:46.967 --> 12:48.969
YOU AND TOM CAN JOIN US,
AND WE'LL TURN IT

12:48.969 --> 12:53.103
INTO A LOW PRESSURE
JOB INTERVIEW.
 THANK YOU.
THIS WILL REALLY CHEER TOM UP.

12:53.103 --> 12:56.176
GREAT. I'LL CALL BRUCE
THIS AFTERNOON.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.554
(sighs)
COULD YOU CALL HIM NOW?

13:04.554 --> 13:07.457
(indistinct conversations)

13:07.457 --> 13:09.419
(clears throat) HEY, MIKE.

13:09.419 --> 13:12.262
OH, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ONE
OF YOUR WORLD-FAMOUS MARTINIS.

13:12.262 --> 13:14.865
SO WAS MRS. McCLUSKEY.
SHE GOT HERE EARLY.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.429
AH.
 YEAH, BUT DON'T PANIC.
I SENT EDIE OUT FOR MORE BOOZE.

13:19.429 --> 13:22.802
AH. SO YOU SENT THE MOUSE
TO BUY THE CHEESE. WELL DONE.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.234
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.937
SOMEBODY OWES ME $20.
 HOW ABOUT WE LET IT RIDE?

13:26.937 --> 13:29.539
DOUBLE OR NOTHING--McCLUSKEY
SLUGS SOMEONE BY 5:00.

13:29.539 --> 13:32.242
KATHERINE AND I TOLD YOU GUYS
WE WERE TAKING THE HIGH ROAD.

13:32.242 --> 13:35.245
WHY WON'T YOU BELIEVE US?
 BECAUSE I VIVIDLY REMEMBER
YESTERDAY,

13:35.245 --> 13:37.217
AND I WASN'T BORN DURING IT.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.919
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:38.919 --> 13:41.922
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING
I THINK MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.224
SO KATHERINE HAS A PICTURE
THAT I PAINTED FOR MIKE

13:44.224 --> 13:46.897
HANGING OVER
HER MANTELPIECE.
 DOES SHE KNOW YOU PAINTED IT?

13:46.897 --> 13:49.559
YES, AND WE TALKED ALL ABOUT IT.
SHE LOVES IT.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.862
(laughter in distance)

13:53.433 --> 13:55.435
YOU PAINTED THAT?
WOW. YOU'RE GOOD.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.209
WHAT?
WHERE THE HELL IS IT?
 BYE-BYE, HIGH ROAD.

13:59.209 --> 14:01.141
WHAT'S WITH THE PUSS?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.043
KATHERINE HUNG ONE OF
MIKE'S PAINTINGS OVER THE MANTEL

14:03.043 --> 14:05.976
TILL SHE FOUND OUT
SUSAN PAINTED IT.

14:05.976 --> 14:09.279
THEN SHE TOOK IT DOWN.
 OOH. SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS PARTY'S ABOUT TO GET GOOD.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.351
YOU KNOW, THERE COULD BE

14:11.351 --> 14:14.284
A PERFECTLY INNOCENT
EXPLANATION.
 HEY, KATHY.

14:14.284 --> 14:17.257
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SUSAN'S PAINTING?

14:17.257 --> 14:20.260
OH! I AM SUCH A KLUTZ.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.032
I WAS DUSTING YESTERDAY,

14:22.032 --> 14:24.464
AND, WELL, IT JUST FELL.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.068
THE GLASS SHATTERED, AND UGH.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.201
IT TOOK IT TO THE FRAMER.
IT'LL BE BACK IN A JIFFY.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.402
MM.

14:32.402 --> 14:34.174
OH! EXCUSE ME.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.605
(sighs)

14:35.605 --> 14:38.979
SEE A PERFECTLY INNOCENT...

14:38.979 --> 14:41.251
BALD-FACED LIE.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.283
IT IS POSSIBLE.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.115
I JUST DRAINED
A PITCHER OF MARTINIS.

14:45.115 --> 14:46.987
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.989
REALLY, SUSAN,
THERE'S NOT A WOMAN IN THE WORLD

14:48.989 --> 14:51.992
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
"I BROKE IT DUSTING" MEANS.
 THAT'S HOW I GOT RID

14:51.992 --> 14:55.295
OF TOM'S LAST BOTTLE
OF "MUSK, THE COLOGNE FOR MEN."

14:55.295 --> 14:57.297
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS THINK WHAT YOU WANT.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.199
I'M GONNA CHOOSE TO BELIEVE HER.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.157
ALL RIGHT, SO WE HAVE
WHISKEY AND BOURBON.

15:27.157 --> 15:29.159
WHAT ELSE DOES MIKE WANT?

15:29.159 --> 15:31.161
BUP, BUP, BUP.
WE NEED A SYSTEM.

15:31.161 --> 15:33.163
LET'S START
OVER THERE IN SCOTLAND,

15:33.163 --> 15:36.136
HEAD OVER TO RUSSIA AND WORK
OUR WAY AROUND THE GLOBE.
 (laughs)

15:36.136 --> 15:39.139
WOW. IT'S CROWDED IN HERE.
 THEY'RE ALL
BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.211
THE JACKPOT'S $100 MILLION.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.073
LOOK. THERE'S A PRIEST.

15:43.073 --> 15:46.016
I KNEW THAT VOW OF POVERTY
WAS A CROCK.

15:49.419 --> 15:51.551
HELLO!

15:53.323 --> 15:55.285
YOU REMEMBER ME.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.027
FATHER DRANCE.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.591
I-I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D MOVED BACK
TO THE AREA.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.335
OH, I JUST REMEMBERED.
MIKE WANTS VERMOUTH.

16:05.335 --> 16:07.967
CAN YOU GRAB THAT
BEFORE WE FORGET?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.239
SURE.

16:09.239 --> 16:11.041
RIGHT AWAY.

16:12.342 --> 16:15.275
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU
LOOKING SO WELL. I--

16:15.275 --> 16:17.347
SHUT UP.

16:17.347 --> 16:20.150
I'M ONLY GONNA SAY THIS ONCE.
I'VE MOVED ON.

16:23.053 --> 16:25.055
I'VE REMARRIED,
I HAVE A NEW LIFE,

16:25.055 --> 16:28.058
AND THAT'S THE WAY
I WANT IT TO STAY--NEW.

16:28.058 --> 16:30.160
OF COURSE.

16:36.326 --> 16:39.129
SO, UH, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

16:39.129 --> 16:42.132
OH. HE SAID WE SAT TOGETHER
ONCE ON AN AIRPLANE.

16:42.132 --> 16:44.434
APPARENTLY HE'S LESS MEMORABLE
THAN HE THINKS HE IS.

16:44.434 --> 16:47.207
COME ON. I DON'T WANT
TO MISS THE PARTY.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.653
(Gabrielle) FINE.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.296
FINE.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.798
FINE. I WILL DO IT,
BUT YOU OWE ME.

17:08.798 --> 17:11.060
I GOTTA GO.
 (beep)

17:11.060 --> 17:13.262
LET ME GUESS. BRAD.

17:13.262 --> 17:16.266
YES, HE WANTS ME TO TAKE MARIA
SHOPPING TOMORROW.
 YEAH, SO HE CAN GRAB
A QUICKIE.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.268
YOU KNOW,
THIS WHOLE THING IS DISGUSTING.

17:18.268 --> 17:21.271
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
 I KNOW.
JUST KEEP REMINDING YOURSELF

17:21.271 --> 17:23.373
THAT WE'RE GETTING THINGS
OUT OF IT, TOO.

17:23.373 --> 17:27.277
THINGS I DON'T WANT.
THINGS I HAVEN'T EARNED.

17:27.277 --> 17:29.279
NO, I'M GONNA TELL BRADLEY
WE'RE OUT.

17:29.279 --> 17:31.281
WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

17:31.281 --> 17:34.754
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR JOB
AND ALL THAT MONEY.
 I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.256
I DO...
 (slaps chest)

17:36.256 --> 17:39.559
AND SO DOES MY PERSONAL SHOPPER
AND PILATES INSTRUCTOR.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.632
GABY, NO.
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

17:42.632 --> 17:45.735
OR WE CAN...

17:45.735 --> 17:48.138
MAKE SOMEONE ELSE
DO THE RIGHT THING.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.240
GABY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:50.240 --> 17:52.502
IT MEANS...

17:52.502 --> 17:54.544
TOMORROW
I'M GOING TO THE MALL

17:54.544 --> 17:57.547
TO GET MY HAIR CUT BY A SLUT.

17:57.547 --> 18:00.650
(groans) MM.

18:00.650 --> 18:03.483
(indistinct conversations)

18:05.385 --> 18:08.488
HEY. UH, LOOK AT WHAT I FOUND--
MY BEACH PAINTING.
 (door closes)

18:08.488 --> 18:10.820
OH, YEAH.
KATHERINE TOLD ME IT BROKE.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.322
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:12.322 --> 18:14.794
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT SHE TOLD ME, TOO,

18:14.794 --> 18:17.627
ONLY, UH, IT DIDN'T.

18:23.373 --> 18:25.305
THAT'S WEIRD.
WHY WOULD SHE...

18:25.305 --> 18:27.106
I DON'T KNOW.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.380
SHE SEEMED TO LOVE
THE PAINTING...

18:30.380 --> 18:33.783
UNTIL I TOLD HER
THAT I PAINTED IT.

18:35.345 --> 18:37.347
EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE.

18:39.189 --> 18:40.620
(door opens)

18:40.620 --> 18:43.293
(Mike)
I'M NOT MAKING A BIG DEAL.

18:43.293 --> 18:46.296
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU LIED.
 (Katherine)
MIKE, PLEASE, NOT NOW.

18:46.296 --> 18:49.559
WE HAVE
A HOUSE FULL OF GUESTS.
 NO, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.362
(Lynette) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 UH, NOTHING.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.464
(Mike) SUSAN SHOWED ME
THE PAINTING.

18:54.464 --> 18:56.636
THERE'S NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.
 (Katherine) SHE WHAT?!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.338
(Gabrielle whispers)
YOU DIDN'T.
 (door slams)

18:58.338 --> 19:01.241
SUSAN!

19:07.317 --> 19:10.220
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT.
 I DIDN'T.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.353
(clicks tongue)
 (scoffs)

19:15.154 --> 19:17.287
I DIDN'T. UH...

19:19.559 --> 19:22.462
(blow-dryer whirring)
 SO WHAT ARE WE THINKING?

19:22.462 --> 19:25.295
WELL, SHAYLA--
IT IS SHAYLA, RIGHT?

19:25.295 --> 19:26.436
MM-HMM.

19:26.436 --> 19:28.798
I NEED A FRESH LOOK.
 MM.

19:28.798 --> 19:30.300
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH

19:30.300 --> 19:32.402
SOME PRETTY INTENSE
PERSONAL STUFF LATELY.

19:32.402 --> 19:33.643
OH. REALLY?

19:33.643 --> 19:36.876
FINE. I'LL TELL YOU.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.380
I HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED MAN,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.452
AND IT'S COME TO THAT POINT

19:42.452 --> 19:45.455
WHERE I CAN'T EVEN LOOK
AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

19:45.455 --> 19:48.458
SO I WANT A NEW STYLE THAT SAYS
I'M NOT A GIANT TURD OF SIN.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.460
WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

19:50.460 --> 19:53.493
THAT YOU FELL IN LOVE
WITH A MARRIED MAN.
 YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
AT FIRST,

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
AND THEN I REALIZED
THAT'S STUPID.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.567
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
HIS POOR WIFE?

19:57.567 --> 19:59.599
WELL, MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
LOVE HIM ENOUGH.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.472
OH, NO. SHE DOES.
SHE LOVES HIM PLENTY.

20:02.472 --> 20:05.275
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BANGS UP
A LITTLE BIT?

20:05.275 --> 20:07.707
AND HE HAS KIDS--
TWO ADORABLE LITTLE KIDS.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.409
THAT'S SAD,

20:09.409 --> 20:12.412
BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.415
WELL, MAYBE I AM TIRED OF BEING
THAT KIND OF SELFISH BITCH.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.417
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED,
UH, HIGHLIGHTS?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
FOCUS, SHAYLA!
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

20:19.419 --> 20:21.551
HOW I'M RUINING
INNOCENT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

20:21.551 --> 20:25.295
GABY, YOU SEEM LIKE
A LOVELY, WARM PERSON.

20:25.295 --> 20:26.656
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

20:26.656 --> 20:29.559
OH, FOR GOD SAKES,
YOU BLEACHED BLONDE TWIT.

20:29.559 --> 20:32.262
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ME. I'M
TALKING ABOUT YOU AND BRADLEY.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.735
WHAT? WHAT--WHAT IS THIS?
WHO--WHO ARE YOU?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.737
I'M A FRIEND OF MARIA'S,
WHO, BY THE WAY,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.839
HAPPENS TO BE
A WARM AND LOVELY PERSON.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.312
WELL, MAYBE SHE IS,
BUT BRAD DOESN'T LOVE HER.

20:42.312 --> 20:44.314
HE SAYS
HE'S GONNA LEAVE HER.

20:44.314 --> 20:47.517
OH, SHAYLA, HE'S LYING.
SHE'S PREGNANT.

20:47.517 --> 20:50.420
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THEY HAVEN'T
HAD SEX IN OVER A YEAR.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.282
WELL, CALL THE VATICAN,

20:52.282 --> 20:55.254
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED
A MANGER AND SOME HAY.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.488
GET OUT.
 I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU HERE.

20:58.488 --> 21:01.291
I SAID GET OUT NOW.

21:03.793 --> 21:06.296
OKAY, LET'S JUST TAKE
A DEEP BREATH HERE--

21:06.296 --> 21:09.339
LET'S NOT DO ANYTHING
WE'RE GONNA REGRET.

21:09.339 --> 21:12.342
NOW.

21:16.306 --> 21:19.409
(grunts, scoffs)

21:19.409 --> 21:23.613
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER
GET THEIR HAIR CUT IN A MALL!

21:36.866 --> 21:39.869
MWAH. OHH.
YOU COULDN'T SHAVE?

21:39.869 --> 21:41.501
(scoffs)

21:41.501 --> 21:43.733
COME ON, TOM.
YOU NEED TO LOOK NICE.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.736
BREE'S GOING TO A LOT OF TROUBLE
FOR THIS DINNER.

21:46.736 --> 21:49.439
WHAT, IS SHE DEBUTING
A NEW SALMON PUFF?

21:49.439 --> 21:51.310
OKAY. I WAS GOING TO WAIT

21:51.310 --> 21:53.813
TO TELL YOU THIS
WHEN YOU WERE IN A GOOD MOOD,

21:53.813 --> 21:55.915
BUT I REALIZE
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,

21:55.915 --> 21:58.588
SO BREE HAS A SPECIAL GUEST
TONIGHT, HER PUBLISHER...
 MM-HMM.

21:58.588 --> 22:00.590
AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

22:00.590 --> 22:03.423
HE'S LOOKING TO HIRE
A NEW MARKETING EXECUTIVE.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.425
OH, MY GOD. WHAT ARE YOU--

22:05.425 --> 22:07.427
ARE YOU TRICKING ME
INTO A JOB INTERVIEW?

22:07.427 --> 22:10.430
I'LL FIND SOMETHING, OKAY?
I JUST NEED SOME TIME.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.432
YOU'RE GRIEVING. I GET IT.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.465
BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A FANTASTIC JOB.

22:15.465 --> 22:18.938
PLEASE JUST HEAR THE GUY OUT
AND MAKE A NICE...

22:18.938 --> 22:19.969
IMPRESSION.

22:19.969 --> 22:22.442
FINE. I'LL SHAVE.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.714
AND BRUSH YOUR TEETH.
MY EYES ARE WATERING.

22:24.714 --> 22:26.976
OH. (scoffs)

22:26.976 --> 22:29.749
AND DON'T JUST WET
THE TOOTHBRUSH.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.752
I CAN TELL.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.924
(doorbell rings)

22:37.427 --> 22:38.858
BRUCE.
 HELLO.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.860
HI. COME ON IN.
 HI.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.833
HI.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.465
MAY I TAKE YOUR COAT?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.096
SURE.
 (Orson) LET ME.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.769
OH, WAIT. LET ME GET
MY "BRAIN" OUT OF THERE.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.841
I NEVER GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT THIS.

22:51.841 --> 22:53.843
THAT WAY, WHEN I GET
A BRIGHT IDEA--

22:53.843 --> 22:56.005
WHAM! RIGHT INTO
THE TAPE RECORDER.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.748
HUH. SOUNDS LIKE
QUITE A HANDY GIZMO.
 THANK YOU, ORVILLE.

22:58.748 --> 23:00.450
IT'S ORSON.

23:00.450 --> 23:03.483
ORVILLE, ORSON--EITHER WAY,
HE CAME HOME FROM THE PLAYGROUND

23:03.483 --> 23:06.656
COVERED IN BRUISES.
AM I RIGHT? (chuckles)

23:06.656 --> 23:08.157
(beep)
 IDEA FOR CHILDREN'S BOOK--

23:08.157 --> 23:10.119
KID WHO GETS THE CRAP
KICKED OUT OF HIM

23:10.119 --> 23:13.122
'CAUSE HE HAS A GOOFY NAME.
COULD BE "ORSON."
 (beep, doorbell rings)

23:13.122 --> 23:15.124
OH, THAT'S THEM.
WAIT TILL YOU MEET TOM.

23:15.124 --> 23:17.827
YOU'LL BE SO GLAD
YOU HAD THAT TAPE RECORDER.

23:17.827 --> 23:20.129
HE'S JUST BURSTING
WITH IDEAS.

23:20.129 --> 23:22.131
(Lynette) HI.
 LYNETTE, TOM, HI.

23:22.131 --> 23:25.134
(Tom) HEY.
 I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY PUBLISHER, BRUCE.

23:25.134 --> 23:27.607
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:27.607 --> 23:31.410
HEY. BREE, I'M GETTING A BEER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

23:35.445 --> 23:38.087
HEY, KATHERINE.

23:38.087 --> 23:40.089
MIKE IS STANDING
ACROSS THE STREET

23:40.089 --> 23:42.091
WATCHING TO MAKE SURE
I APOLOGIZE,

23:42.091 --> 23:45.094
EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLEAR TO ME
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD

23:45.094 --> 23:47.096
BE APOLOGIZING FOR THE WAY
YOU RUINED MY PARTY.

23:47.096 --> 23:48.598
(whispers) ONE, TWO, THREE.

23:48.598 --> 23:51.200
(normal voice) WELL, THAT SHOULD
BE LONG ENOUGH, SO HERE.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.663
KISS MY ASS. BYE.

23:53.663 --> 23:55.465
HOLD ON.

23:57.106 --> 23:59.168
I'M SORRY.

23:59.168 --> 24:03.442
BUT NEITHER OF US EXACTLY GETS
A GOLD STAR FOR MODEL BEHAVIOR.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.914
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

24:04.914 --> 24:07.717
WHY NOT? I MEAN,
YOU LOVED THAT PAINTING

24:07.717 --> 24:10.049
UNTIL YOU FOUND OUT
THAT I DID IT,

24:10.049 --> 24:12.051
AND THEN YOU ACTED
TOTALLY PETTY.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.554
SO WHY AM I
THE ONLY BAD GUY HERE?

24:19.929 --> 24:22.762
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
OKAY?

24:22.762 --> 24:25.194
DIDN'T IT GIVE YOU
JUST THE TINIEST LITTLE THRILL

24:25.194 --> 24:26.896
TO TELL ME THAT

24:26.896 --> 24:30.139
THAT PAINTING THAT I WAS
SO HAPPY ABOUT WAS YOURS?

24:30.139 --> 24:32.502
THAT I HAD
SOMETHING IN MY HOUSE

24:32.502 --> 24:34.844
THAT REPRESENTED THE LOVE
BETWEEN YOU AND MIKE?

24:34.844 --> 24:36.576
NO.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.478
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
SUSAN?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.251
CAN'T YOU SEE
HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME?

24:42.251 --> 24:44.514
YOU LIVE
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

24:44.514 --> 24:46.956
YOU GUYS SHARE A KID.

24:46.956 --> 24:49.959
DO I HAVE TO HAVE A PAINTING
OF YOUR HONEYMOON, TOO?

24:52.021 --> 24:54.193
LOOK, I KNEW
I WASN'T GOING TO GET

24:54.193 --> 24:56.195
A CLEAN SLATE WITH MIKE,
OKAY?

24:56.195 --> 24:59.969
I JUST WANTED
A CLEAN MANTELPIECE.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.511
OH.
 (silverware clatters)

25:12.511 --> 25:15.785
FANTASTIC DINNER, BREE.
THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA.

25:15.785 --> 25:18.788
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO GET YOU
TOGETHER WITH TOM HERE.

25:18.788 --> 25:20.790
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
MIGHT HIT IT OFF.

25:20.790 --> 25:24.554
YEAH. TOM, BREE SAYS YOU USED
TO BE QUITE THE AD WIZ.

25:24.554 --> 25:26.796
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

25:26.796 --> 25:29.999
HE'S BEING MODEST.
HE WAS THE BEST.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.300
GOOD, BECAUSE I'M LOOKING

25:31.300 --> 25:34.003
FOR SOMEONE TO HEAD UP
A NEW DIVISION.

25:34.003 --> 25:36.205
I'M GOING TO PUT
SOME COFFEE ON.

25:36.205 --> 25:39.068
ORSON,
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

25:39.068 --> 25:40.710
LET THESE THREE CHAT.

25:42.872 --> 25:44.113
(sniffles)

25:44.113 --> 25:46.245
SO DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST

25:46.245 --> 25:48.547
IN GETTING BACK
IN THE GAME?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.049
I DON'T KNOW.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.582
THE TIMING'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
(chuckles)

25:52.582 --> 25:54.553
HOW SO?

25:54.553 --> 25:55.855
I DON'T KNOW.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.789
WELL, TOM WAS JUST RUNNING
A VERY SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT,

25:59.789 --> 26:02.632
AND HE JUST SOLD IT
AT A HANDSOME PROFIT.

26:02.632 --> 26:06.095
SO HE'S WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY.

26:06.095 --> 26:09.669
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE SELLING HERE, BRUCE.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.872
HUH. I GUESS THE GOOD ONES ARE
ALWAYS THE HARDEST TO LAND.

26:12.872 --> 26:13.943
YEAH.

26:13.943 --> 26:15.905
LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

26:15.905 --> 26:17.777
WE REPRESENT A SMALL STABLE

26:17.777 --> 26:19.779
OF ELITE NONFICTION AUTHORS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.311
SO YOU'D BE WORKING CLOSELY
WITH THOSE WRITERS

26:22.311 --> 26:23.813
TO COME UP WITH

26:23.813 --> 26:25.955
CREATIVE APPROACHES
TO SELLING THEIR BOOKS.

26:25.955 --> 26:29.118
THAT SOUNDS... AMAZING.

26:29.118 --> 26:31.020
I DON'T KNOW.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.662
ARE THERE MORE POTATOES?

26:32.662 --> 26:36.325
YOU CAN HAVE MINE.
(chuckles)

26:36.325 --> 26:38.297
(whispers) STOP SAYING,
"I DON'T KNOW."

26:38.297 --> 26:40.029
(chuckles nervously)

26:40.029 --> 26:41.671
MM.

26:41.671 --> 26:43.673
SOUNDS LIKE
THERE'S A LOT OF TRAVELING.

26:43.673 --> 26:47.006
I'M NOT, YOU KNOW, REALLY BIG
ON LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.208
EVEN TO DO TWO WEEKS
AT THE BOOK FAIR IN PARIS

26:49.208 --> 26:51.881
WHILE YOU STAY
AT A FIVE-STAR HOTEL?

26:51.881 --> 26:53.242
PARIS?

26:53.242 --> 26:54.944
LIKE FRANCE?

26:54.944 --> 26:57.616
YES, LIKE THE GREATEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.289
GEE, I'M GETTING
LYNETTE EXCITED.

27:00.289 --> 27:03.392
TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY ADVERTISING EXPERIENCE.

27:03.392 --> 27:05.194
OH.

27:08.698 --> 27:12.201
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

27:12.201 --> 27:13.833
REALLY?

27:13.833 --> 27:14.934
YEAH.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.336
I WAS ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE
FOR EIGHT YEARS,

27:17.336 --> 27:20.109
V.P. FOR FOUR MORE AFTER THAT,

27:20.109 --> 27:22.271
AND BY THE WAY,
I WROTE MY GRADUATE THESIS

27:22.271 --> 27:25.414
ON THE RISE
OF THE NONFICTION NOVEL.

27:25.414 --> 27:27.076
W-WOW.

27:27.076 --> 27:30.750
I KNOW. SO WHAT KIND OF STARTING
SALARY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

27:30.750 --> 27:34.053
(laughs)
 LYNETTE,
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SEC?

27:34.053 --> 27:36.325
OKAY. BRUCE,
COULD YOU HOLD THAT THOUGHT?

27:36.325 --> 27:39.388
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

27:41.230 --> 27:43.392
(gasps) WELL,
WE'RE ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

27:43.392 --> 27:46.235
HOW'S IT GOING?

27:46.235 --> 27:49.398
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M GETTING THIS JOB.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

27:49.398 --> 27:53.202
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY JOB.
 WELL, YOU'RE NOT ACTING LIKE
YOU WANT IT VERY MUCH, MISTER...

27:53.202 --> 27:55.344
(imitates Tom)
"UH, I DON'T KNOW.

27:55.344 --> 27:58.047
ARE THERE ANY MORE POTATOES?"
 IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT IT.

27:58.047 --> 28:00.349
IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S ALL HAPPENING SO FAST.

28:00.349 --> 28:04.213
I NEED A LITTLE TIME
TO LICK MY WOUNDS.
 OKAY, YOU LICK.
I'M GOING TO PARIS.

28:04.213 --> 28:07.116
YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY JOB.

28:07.116 --> 28:09.418
YOUR JOB? THE ONE YOU'RE
MAGICALLY GONNA GET BY SULKING

28:09.418 --> 28:12.762
AND ACTING LIKE A BRAT?
YOU HAD A SHOT. YOU BLEW IT.

28:12.762 --> 28:14.263
OH, YEAH?
 YEAH.

28:14.263 --> 28:18.327
YOU JUST MESSED WITH THE BULL,
SISTER.

28:18.327 --> 28:20.930
PREPARE TO GET THE HORNS.

28:22.331 --> 28:24.834
I... UGH!

28:24.834 --> 28:27.236
MAYBE WE SHOULD SLICE THE TART
IN HERE.

28:27.236 --> 28:30.339
I DON'T WANT TO BRING
A LARGE KNIFE INTO THIS.

28:42.151 --> 28:44.323
BRUCE...

28:44.323 --> 28:46.325
I WAS JUST SAYING TO LYNETTE,

28:46.325 --> 28:49.328
I GAVE YOU MY "I DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT THIS JOB" THING

28:49.328 --> 28:51.901
TO SEE IF YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT THIS JOB,

28:51.901 --> 28:55.004
AND YOU DO, AND I LIKE THAT.

28:55.004 --> 28:56.766
CLEVER.

28:56.766 --> 28:58.938
NOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED
COMPENSATION PACKAGE YET,

28:58.938 --> 29:01.010
BUT I GOT A GOOD FEELING--

29:01.010 --> 29:04.013
YOU KNOW, TOM, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BRUCE DOES CARE ABOUT THIS JOB.

29:04.013 --> 29:06.375
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS
TO MAKE SURE

29:06.375 --> 29:08.848
HE GETS THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR IT.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.350
WELL, LYNETTE, YOU YOURSELF
SAID I WAS THE BEST.

29:11.350 --> 29:15.084
OH, YOU WERE. YOU WERE THE BEST
PERSON WHO EVER WORKED FOR ME.

29:15.084 --> 29:18.387
I USED TO BE HIS BOSS.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.262
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
 I DON'T KNOW

29:23.262 --> 29:27.867
WHY EITHER ONE OF THEM WANTS
TO WORK FOR THAT JACKASS.
 NOW, NOW.
HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.869
WELL, OF COURSE HE HAS,

29:29.869 --> 29:31.871
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
YOU MAKE HIM A LOT OF MONEY.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.874
ME, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE SEES
AS AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE MAN,

29:34.874 --> 29:36.375
BARELY WORTH MENTIONING

29:36.375 --> 29:40.910
AS HE TALKS INTO HIS ANNOYING,
PENIS-SHAPED TAPE RECORDER.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.381
SO I SAID TO HIM,

29:42.381 --> 29:46.315
"JE CROIS QUE C'EST L'HOMME
QUI FAIT LES CHEZ D'OEUVRES."

29:46.315 --> 29:48.818
AND HE SAID TO ME,
 "NON, LYNETTE.

29:48.818 --> 29:52.261
CE SONT LES CHEZ D'OEUVRES
QUI FONT L'HOMME."

29:52.261 --> 29:55.925
(chuckles) GREAT STORY...
I ASSUME.

29:55.925 --> 29:58.998
I DON'T SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE,
BUT I'VE HAD AD CAMPAIGNS

29:58.998 --> 30:01.100
TRANSLATED
INTO 12 DIFFERENT ONES,

30:01.100 --> 30:03.432
INCLUDING PROFESSOR CRISPY'S
POTATO CHIPS.

30:03.432 --> 30:05.504
I LOVE THAT CAMPAIGN.
YOU DID THAT?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.036
I DID.

30:07.036 --> 30:09.879
YES. TOM WAS VERY GOOD
AT HIS JOB,

30:09.879 --> 30:13.382
RIGHT UP UNTIL HE GOT FIRED.
(chuckles)

30:13.382 --> 30:16.485
(chuckles) WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS RELIEVED TO GET FIRED.

30:16.485 --> 30:18.517
MY BOSS WAS
KIND OF A BALLBUSTER.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.290
OOPS. SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
(laughs)

30:21.290 --> 30:24.293
JE REGRETTE.

30:24.293 --> 30:27.426
(door opens)

30:27.426 --> 30:29.458
OH. WOULD ANYONE CARE
FOR SOMETHING SWEET?

30:29.458 --> 30:31.530
I KNOW I WOULD.

30:39.468 --> 30:43.412
WELL, WE'VE ALL HAD OUR TROUBLES
AS BOSSES, HAVEN'T WE, TOM?

30:43.412 --> 30:45.414
I WAS SORT OF SUGARCOATING IT

30:45.414 --> 30:47.977
WHEN I SAID HIS RESTAURANT
WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL.

30:47.977 --> 30:50.279
THE TRUTH IS,
HE MISMANAGED THAT PIZZA JOINT

30:50.279 --> 30:52.221
RIGHT INTO THE GROUND.

30:53.582 --> 30:55.354
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.456
I THINK
LYNETTE IS FANTASTIC.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.528
SHE IS A GREAT MANAGER,

30:59.528 --> 31:01.590
SHE'S GOT
TERRIFIC PEOPLE SKILLS

31:01.590 --> 31:03.292
AND IS VERY RELIABLE...

31:03.292 --> 31:06.635
AS LONG AS THE CANCER
DOESN'T FLARE UP AGAIN.

31:10.469 --> 31:14.303
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:14.303 --> 31:16.105
IT'S GETTING LATE.

31:16.105 --> 31:19.608
I SHOULD PROBABLY HIT THE ROAD.

31:19.608 --> 31:22.481
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE JOB?

31:22.481 --> 31:23.983
YEAH...

31:23.983 --> 31:27.186
I JUST STARTED LOOKING. I'M SURE
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG PROCESS,

31:27.186 --> 31:30.589
BUT TRUST ME, YOU'VE CERTAINLY
MADE AN IMPRESSION.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.494
I'LL GET YOUR COAT.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.468
OH, IT'S A SHAME
YOU CAN'T STAY FOR DESSERT.

31:39.468 --> 31:41.030
I'VE MADE TARTE TATIN.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.272
(beep)
 IDEA FOR NOVEL--

31:43.272 --> 31:47.476
WOMAN WHO'S MARRIED TO A GAY MAN
AND DOESN'T KNOW IT.

31:47.476 --> 31:48.537
(beep)

31:48.537 --> 31:52.281
WELL, THANKS AGAIN.

31:53.482 --> 31:56.545
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'VE HAD
SUCH AN INTERESTING EVENING.

31:56.545 --> 31:59.488
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.153
UH, BRUCE,

32:04.153 --> 32:07.997
WHY DON'T I WRAP UP
A PIECE OF THAT TART TO GO?
 YEAH.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.132
(lowered voice) GIVE IT.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.404
GIVE WHAT?
 BRUCE'S TAPE RECORDER.

32:15.404 --> 32:18.137
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--
 YOU TOOK IT. I SAW YOU.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.939
(Bruce) HEY. HAS ANYBODY SEEN
MY TAPE RECORDER?

32:20.939 --> 32:23.942
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
 I'LL LOOK.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.175
(grunts) HEY.

32:26.175 --> 32:27.476
AH.

32:27.476 --> 32:29.178
STOP.
 (grunts)

32:29.178 --> 32:32.451
I DON'T HAVE IT.
 OOH! WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.653
UH, BRUCE IS LOOKING FOR, UH...

32:38.157 --> 32:40.459
NEVER MIND.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.363
WE WILL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

32:46.295 --> 32:51.600
OH. LOOK WHAT GOT BROUGHT IN
WITH THE DIRTY NAPKINS.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.472
THANKS.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.544
(sighs)

33:02.151 --> 33:05.384
HELLO, GABY.
 OOH!

33:05.384 --> 33:07.416
JEEZ, BRADLEY, YOU SCARED ME!

33:07.416 --> 33:11.060
YOU TALKED TO SHAYLA.
 YEAH, SHE'S A REAL GEM.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.392
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
WE HAVE A DEAL.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.394
WELL, I'M TIRED OF THE DEAL,

33:15.394 --> 33:18.367
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MARIA
IS DESPICABLE.

33:18.367 --> 33:20.369
HEY. YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO JUDGE ME.

33:20.369 --> 33:23.502
DON'T FORGET, I WAS WORKING WITH
CARLOS WHEN YOU CHEATED ON HIM.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.475
YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT THAT PERSON ANYMORE.

33:26.475 --> 33:28.177
I'VE CHANGED.

33:28.177 --> 33:29.678
RIGHT. YOU'RE WORSE.

33:29.678 --> 33:32.181
YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT MARIA

33:32.181 --> 33:34.483
UNTIL THERE'S MONEY
OR VACATION TIME AT STAKE.

33:34.483 --> 33:37.015
THEN YOU'RE ONLY WORRIED
ABOUT GABY.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.318
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.490
I'M OUT.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.492
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 DEAL'S OVER.

33:43.492 --> 33:46.024
I'M NOT COVERING FOR YOUR
STUPID LITTLE FLING ANYMORE.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.026
IT'S NOT A FLING.
I LOVE HER.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.799
SHE'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE WOMAN
I'VE EVER MET.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.801
SHAYLA?
SHE HAS A HELLO KITTY TIP JAR.

33:52.801 --> 33:55.704
WELL, SHE MAKES ME HAPPY.
I CAN'T GIVE HER UP.

33:55.704 --> 33:59.068
(sighs) WELL, AT LEAST BE
MAN ENOUGH TO TELL MARIA,

33:59.068 --> 34:01.410
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I WILL.

34:03.212 --> 34:04.543
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.475
I WILL TELL MARIA.

34:06.475 --> 34:08.377
AND YOU CAN TELL CARLOS

34:08.377 --> 34:13.222
TO BRING A BOX TO WORK ON MONDAY
'CAUSE HE'S FIRED.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.165
SO DINNER...

34:28.337 --> 34:29.598
WOW.

34:29.598 --> 34:32.601
LYNETTE, I WILL REGRET
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

34:32.601 --> 34:34.303
WHAT I SAID TONIGHT.

34:34.303 --> 34:36.804
I... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME.

34:36.804 --> 34:39.408
I DO, AND IT'S OKAY.

34:39.408 --> 34:42.380
BESIDES, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.813
LIKE I SAID... WOW.

34:44.813 --> 34:48.157
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT BRUCE SAID

34:48.157 --> 34:50.659
INTO HIS TAPE RECORDER
ON THE RIDE HOME?

34:50.659 --> 34:52.261
(chuckles)

34:52.261 --> 34:54.422
(imitates Bruce) "IDEA--
CHECK LOCAL MENTAL HOSPITAL

34:54.422 --> 34:56.165
FOR ESCAPED MARRIED COUPLE."

34:56.165 --> 34:57.396
(chuckles)

35:07.506 --> 35:09.278
SO...

35:09.278 --> 35:12.811
WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT
WANTING TO GO BACK TO WORK?

35:14.743 --> 35:16.715
(laughs)

35:16.715 --> 35:19.188
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
THAT JOB TONIGHT

35:19.188 --> 35:21.550
AND TRYING TO CONVINCE BRUCE
I WAS GOOD,

35:21.550 --> 35:24.323
AND I REMEMBERED SOMETHING.
I AM GOOD.

35:24.323 --> 35:28.497
AND I WOULD LIKE
ANOTHER CHANCE TO PROVE IT.

35:28.497 --> 35:31.530
OKAY.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.462
REALLY?

35:33.462 --> 35:37.706
YEAH. WE DID MY THING
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

35:37.706 --> 35:39.438
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

35:40.909 --> 35:42.511
OH! MWAH.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.676
DO YOU KNOW HOW EMBARRASSED
I WOULD HAVE BEEN

35:47.676 --> 35:49.718
IF BRUCE
HAD SEEN YOU TAKE IT?

35:49.718 --> 35:52.551
HE DESERVED IT.
HE INSULTED ME.

35:52.551 --> 35:55.254
SO SAY SOMETHING.
STAND UP TO HIM. BUT STEALING?

35:55.254 --> 35:58.257
HONESTLY, ORSON, WHY WOULD
YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.829
I DON'T KNOW, BREE.

36:00.829 --> 36:03.792
I DON'T.
HERE'S SOMETHING I DO KNOW--

36:03.792 --> 36:05.794
WHEN I WAS
A SUCCESSFUL DENTIST,

36:05.794 --> 36:09.338
NO ONE SPOKE TO ME
THE WAY THEY DO NOW.

36:09.338 --> 36:11.700
WHEN I LOST MY PRACTICE,
I LOST PEOPLE'S RESPECT.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.643
AND YOU HOPE TO EARN IT BACK
THROUGH LARCENY?

36:14.643 --> 36:16.645
YOU HAVEN'T WALKED
IN MY SHOES.

36:16.645 --> 36:19.908
TOM LOST HIS JOB.
EVERYONE JUMPED TO HIS RESCUE.

36:19.908 --> 36:21.650
EVEN YOU--

36:21.650 --> 36:24.613
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS
TRYING TO GET HIM A JOB.

36:24.613 --> 36:26.955
I DON'T NEED TO WALK
IN YOUR SHOES, ORSON.

36:26.955 --> 36:29.958
WHAT YOU DID WAS EMBARRASSING
AND CHILDISH,

36:29.958 --> 36:32.591
AND IT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.523
UNDERSTOOD?

37:02.491 --> 37:05.494
(indistinct conversations)

37:09.498 --> 37:11.660
SEE YOU. THANK YOU.

37:11.660 --> 37:14.703
FATHER?
 YES. CAN I HELP YOU?

37:14.703 --> 37:17.706
OH, I HOPE SO.
I, UH, SAW YOU THE OTHER NIGHT

37:17.706 --> 37:19.708
WHEN YOU WERE
BUYING YOUR LOTTERY TICKET.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.740
I WAS WITH MY HUSBAND DAVE.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.712
AH.

37:23.712 --> 37:26.575
YES. HE SAID THAT
YOU BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER,

37:26.575 --> 37:28.917
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM THAT WAY
TO ME.

37:28.917 --> 37:31.450
AND, WELL,

37:31.450 --> 37:34.583
HE REFUSES TO TALK
ABOUT HIS PAST,

37:34.583 --> 37:37.726
SO IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT
YOU COULD TELL ME ABOUT HIM--

37:37.726 --> 37:40.859
I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THAT.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.962
PLEASE.
 HE HAS SO MANY SECRETS,

37:43.962 --> 37:46.295
AND I DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO TURN TO.

37:46.295 --> 37:49.638
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
BUT...

37:49.638 --> 37:52.801
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

37:52.801 --> 37:55.604
WELL, IF IT WAS THAT EASY,

37:55.604 --> 37:59.508
DO YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD BE HERE?
 I'M SORRY.

37:59.508 --> 38:04.453
PLEASE KNOW THAT MY THOUGHTS
ARE WITH YOU BOTH, MRS. DASH.

38:04.453 --> 38:07.316
IT'S WILLIAMS.

38:07.316 --> 38:09.518
I'M TOO OLD-SCHOOL
FOR MY OWN GOOD.

38:09.518 --> 38:13.061
I SHOULDN'T JUST ASSUME THAT
YOU TOOK YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME.

38:13.061 --> 38:15.324
ANYWAY...

38:15.324 --> 38:18.467
GOOD LUCK, MRS. WILLIAMS.

38:33.782 --> 38:36.785
HEY, SUSAN. I THOUGHT
I HAD M.J. TILL 7:00.

38:36.785 --> 38:39.748
UH, YOU DO. I AM HERE
TO TAKE MY PAINTING BACK.

38:39.748 --> 38:42.020
BUT YOU GAVE IT TO ME.
IT'S MINE.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.493
WELL, NOW I'M UNGIVING IT.
TRY TO KEEP UP.

38:44.493 --> 38:47.996
OKAY, IF THIS IS ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE HOUSEWARMING...

38:47.996 --> 38:49.498
IT IS, ACTUALLY,

38:49.498 --> 38:51.800
BECAUSE THAT IS
WHEN I DECIDED

38:51.800 --> 38:56.465
THAT I DON'T WANT THIS PIECE
OF ART THAT I SLAVED OVER

38:56.465 --> 38:58.607
HANGING IN THE HOUSE
YOU ARE SHARING

38:58.607 --> 39:00.709
WITH YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND.
 CAPISCE?

39:00.709 --> 39:02.871
OKAY, SO THE OTHER NIGHT
YOU WERE MAD

39:02.871 --> 39:05.874
BECAUSE IT WASN'T HANGING UP,
BUT NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE IT?

39:05.874 --> 39:08.877
YEP. I'M COMPLICATED LIKE THAT.
AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU DIVORCED ME?

39:08.877 --> 39:12.350
IF YOU TWO WANT A PAINTING
SO BAD, PAINT YOUR OWN.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.722
SUSAN--
 MAYFAIR.

39:13.722 --> 39:15.353
(scoffs)

39:15.353 --> 39:16.985
STAY OUT OF THIS.

39:19.988 --> 39:23.632
THIS IS
BETWEEN ME AND MY EX.

39:23.632 --> 39:24.963
GOT IT?

39:42.050 --> 39:43.652
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:47.556 --> 39:50.559
ANYWAY, I'M THINKING A BRIGHTER
COLOR FOR THE BABY'S ROOM.

39:50.559 --> 39:52.891
NOW I KNOW
IT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH,

39:52.891 --> 39:55.594
BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT TURQUOISE?

39:58.697 --> 40:00.569
SWEETHEART?

40:02.501 --> 40:04.533
WE NEED TO TALK.

40:22.150 --> 40:24.493
WHAT YOU READING?

40:24.493 --> 40:26.595
THE WANT ADS.

40:26.595 --> 40:29.628
CAN'T DECIDE IF I SHOULD BE
A DATA ENTRY OPERATOR

40:29.628 --> 40:31.460
OR JOIN THE MARINES.

40:32.761 --> 40:34.463
I'M SO SORRY.

40:34.463 --> 40:37.466
DON'T BE. I TOLD YOU, I HATED
WORKING FOR THAT JACKASS.

40:37.466 --> 40:40.469
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
 I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER.

40:40.469 --> 40:41.770
BUT YOU DID IT,

40:41.770 --> 40:44.773
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA LOSE A LOT OF MONEY.

40:44.773 --> 40:47.776
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, BABE.
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

40:47.776 --> 40:51.449
WELL, THAT MEANS A LOT, COMING
FROM A UNITED STATES MARINE.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.023
MM.
 (telephone rings)

40:55.023 --> 40:56.725
(ring, beep)

40:56.725 --> 40:58.687
HELLO?

40:58.687 --> 41:00.589
MARIA.

41:00.589 --> 41:01.990
CALM DOWN.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.892
CALM DOWN.

41:05.694 --> 41:08.537
OKAY, WE'RE COMING OVER.

41:08.537 --> 41:09.838
(beep)

41:09.838 --> 41:12.000
I GUESS BRADLEY TOLD HER.

41:17.506 --> 41:19.808
THANKS FOR COMING.

41:19.808 --> 41:21.910
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE
TO CALL.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.983
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.215
HE JUST KEPT TELLING ME
HE LOVES HER.

41:27.215 --> 41:29.858
SHE'S THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM.

41:29.858 --> 41:33.491
HE FINALLY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT LOVE MEANS.

41:41.530 --> 41:44.072
I JUST WANTED HIM
TO STOP TALKING.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.044
YOU SHOULD NEVER BE
TOO IMPRESSED

41:56.044 --> 41:58.717
BY PEOPLE WITH GOOD MANNERS.

41:58.717 --> 42:01.990
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO WILL GIVE A FRIENDLY WAVE

42:01.990 --> 42:05.253
EVEN WHEN
THEY'VE STOLEN FROM YOU...

42:06.855 --> 42:10.298
THEY'RE THE TYPE
TO SWEETLY WELCOME YOU...

42:10.298 --> 42:14.102
EVEN AS THEY TRY TO UNCOVER
YOUR SECRETS...

42:14.102 --> 42:17.866
(typing on keyboard)

42:17.866 --> 42:22.571
THEY'RE THE KIND
TO OFFER YOU COFFEE,

42:22.571 --> 42:26.845
EVEN AS THEY REPORT YOU
TO THE POLICE.

42:29.948 --> 42:36.054
AND DON'T BE TOO OFFENDED
BY SOMEONE WHO'S OPENLY RUDE...

42:36.054 --> 42:38.687
BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THAT WAY

42:38.687 --> 42:42.661
FOR THE NICEST OF REASONS.
