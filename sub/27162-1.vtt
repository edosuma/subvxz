I could beat him.

- No.

No, that's not
what I'm saying.

I'm not gonna be here forever.

32:03.511 --> 32:04.945

supposed to mean?

32:04.947 --> 32:06.847

do some smart thinking.

a little simpler to say,

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:13.009

(GROANS)

01:57:55.781 --> 01:57:58.483
- I did it. I did it.
- LITTLE DUKE: You did it.

01:57:58.485 --> 01:57:59.952
Hey, Unc.

01:58:09.929 --> 01:58:11.097
(SNIFFS)

01:58:13.165 --> 01:58:14.967
It's your time.

01:58:32.818 --> 01:58:35.154
Hey, okay, back up.

01:58:47.166 --> 01:58:49.667
(CROWD CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

01:59:14.125 --> 01:59:15.394
What's up, Pops?

01:59:19.398 --> 01:59:20.796
(STAMMERS)

01:59:20.798 --> 01:59:23.401
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come see you.

01:59:27.172 --> 01:59:28.538
(SIGHS)

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.342
I'm not sure how
this is supposed to go. Um...

01:59:34.679 --> 01:59:38.047
I guess I should tell you that
Mom's doing pretty good.

01:59:38.049 --> 01:59:40.717
You know, she's holding up.

01:59:42.753 --> 01:59:44.987
So is Rocky.

01:59:44.989 --> 01:59:46.189
ROCKY: Thanks a lot.
DRIVER: Thank you.

01:59:46.191 --> 01:59:47.791
ADONIS: <i>He's a tough dude.</i>

01:59:49.594 --> 01:59:51.762
<i>I can see why you liked him.</i>

01:59:54.132 --> 01:59:57.366
I also see why
you wanted to fight him, too.

01:59:57.368 --> 01:59:58.769
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

02:00:06.277 --> 02:00:07.778
Look, um,

02:00:09.746 --> 02:00:12.049
I just came here
to tell you that...

02:00:18.523 --> 02:00:20.123
That I did it.

02:00:23.794 --> 02:00:26.029
But I didn't do it for you.

02:00:29.466 --> 02:00:31.101
<i>Or because of them.</i>

02:00:33.136 --> 02:00:36.473
<i>I did it because
it was my fight.</i>

02:00:38.508 --> 02:00:40.444
<i>And when I stepped
into that ring,</i>

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.182
it wasn't just about me.

02:00:48.452 --> 02:00:49.453
Hello.

02:00:51.955 --> 02:00:53.588
You must be Logan.

02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:55.023
Yes. Who are you?

02:00:55.025 --> 02:00:57.025
ROBERT: Lo, who is it?

02:00:57.027 --> 02:01:00.861
ADONIS: <i>Sometimes we think we
have to do it all on our own.</i>

02:01:00.863 --> 02:01:02.266
Hey, Robert.

02:01:03.567 --> 02:01:04.934
ADONIS: <i>But we don't.</i>

02:01:06.236 --> 02:01:09.339
I was just around
in the neighborhood, so...

02:01:15.612 --> 02:01:17.347
This is your grandfather.

02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:24.987
(SIGHS)

02:01:28.891 --> 02:01:32.627
You look just like his mother.

02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:33.896
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

02:01:34.530 --> 02:01:35.965
Yeah, I know.

02:01:42.972 --> 02:01:45.274
I wanna introduce you
to somebody.

02:01:55.985 --> 02:01:57.819
Do you wanna come inside?

02:02:05.361 --> 02:02:06.727
Yeah.

02:02:06.729 --> 02:02:08.164
ROBERT: Give me that.

02:02:09.432 --> 02:02:10.832
(ROCKY SNIFFS)

02:02:18.341 --> 02:02:21.974
- Is that a ball?
- ROCKY: Yeah.

02:02:21.976 --> 02:02:24.012
- Wanna play catch?
- LOGAN: Yes.

02:02:25.113 --> 02:02:26.549
There you go.

02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:28.617
This

02:02:30.285 --> 02:02:33.920
is your granddaughter. Amara.

02:02:33.922 --> 02:02:35.957
Say what's up to Pop-Pop.
