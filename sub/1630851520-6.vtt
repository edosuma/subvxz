WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:03.525
Here's the plan for tomorrow.

00:03.568 --> 00:05.135
We start at 8:00 a.m.

00:05.179 --> 00:07.311
First is Dunkin' Donuts,
next is Krispy Kreme...

00:07.355 --> 00:08.356
Hold on.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.835
It's Veterans Day.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.403
There are 27 restaurants
offering free food

00:12.447 --> 00:13.752
to anybody who served
in the military.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.232
Even the Air Force.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.017
You know it.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.672
Point is, you can't go
donut to donut.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.371
Every donut is a chicken pot pie
you're not having later.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.982
Listen to that wisdom.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.898
I've been a veteran
a lot longer than you.

00:28.941 --> 00:31.031
Learn from my mistakes.

00:32.641 --> 00:36.079
Junk, junk, bill.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.602
Something from the V.A.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.909
And you got

00:39.952 --> 00:41.171
a catalog for slippers.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.781
Oh, gimme, gimme.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.481
I hate how excited I am
about this.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.619
What is it?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.839
My disability rating.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.755
Oh.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.023
What does it say?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.025
70 percent.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.680
Wow.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.291
I know.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.076
You okay?

01:17.773 --> 01:20.645
Apparently, I'm only 30% okay.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.651
Good things will come
from this, Riley Jaan.

01:26.695 --> 01:29.001
You'll get a check
every month.

01:29.045 --> 01:32.875
Hearing loss, arthritis, PTSD.

01:32.918 --> 01:36.270
Ooh, that part has
a whole bunch of words.

01:37.445 --> 01:40.622
Let me tell you about
these doctor numbers.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.145
When I was in my mother's womb,

01:42.189 --> 01:45.496
they said I had
a 30% chance to survive.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.891
And look at me now.
I am 100% here.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.505
Hey, do me a favor.
Hmm?

01:54.549 --> 01:57.160
Don't mention this when
the boys come over tomorrow.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.729
Riley, you don't have anything
to be embarrassed about.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.167
Oh, you haven't read
this letter.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.431
Okay.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.129
I won't mention it.

02:10.434 --> 02:13.002
Tomorrow...

02:13.045 --> 02:16.353
is about celebrating
your service, seeing old friends

02:16.397 --> 02:18.660
and eating until we are sick.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.401

02:37.940 --> 02:39.159
I wish you'd come
on our food crawl

02:39.202 --> 02:40.682
instead of doing your parade.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.119
Come on, what would a parade
be without the color guard?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.903
Faster?

Uh, looks good.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.568
Whatever.

Hazel, why don't you go bring
some refreshments for our guests

03:45.268 --> 03:47.531

standing here giggling.

Damn it, Todd, you will
not be slowing us down.

04:01.110 --> 04:04.331
We're not in combat anymore.
We will leave you behind.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.681

being in my dad's squad?

04:06.724 --> 04:08.857
Mm, the greatest.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.772
This one time, we were
on leave in Okinawa...

And I lost my toothbrush.
Next story.

04:13.165 --> 04:17.169
Hey, Hazel, did you know we
used to call your dad Ankles?

04:17.213 --> 04:18.127
[chuckles]How come?

04:18.170 --> 04:19.607
Because wearing
boots and socks

I got stuck behind the horses.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.245
Where are your shoes?

In a dumpster on 18th Street.

What's that?

Michael's stuff.

the house would be empty.

You mind if I grab
a coffee first?

Nah, it's harder than you think.

and everything.

that would be a barrier for you.

Marines give you on the way out?

I'm qualified for.

just get disability.

cash those checks.

money, you deserve the money.

that disability is...

check on the kids.

they had this fancy ceremony,

08:15.190 --> 08:16.931
and then got wasted

into each other's chests.

Why?

You opened the box.

No tears.

08:32.816 --> 08:35.166
Should I be more upset?
No.

a mustache?

shaving it.

No, don't. It looks great.

at the table?

to help Todd.

You helping Todd is
a lot like you pissing me off.

Just leave it alone.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.700
Okay.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.223
How about I take the kids home?

09:32.267 --> 09:33.747
You go to the bar with the guys.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.662
Have many beers
and insult each other.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.359
You're all very good at it.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.490
All right.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.884
Also, I don't want
you to be alarmed,

09:40.928 --> 09:42.799
but these children
are in love.

09:44.061 --> 09:47.021
Don't worry. I will protect
your family's honor.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.197
Sure, you do that. Hmm.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.807
I will make them
walk home.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.680
Exhaustion is the
enemy of passion.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.203
It is, isn't it?

10:06.997 --> 10:08.520
My feet hurt.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.739
No, they don't.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.306
Are you my feet?

10:11.349 --> 10:13.090
I am your elder,
and I used to walk

10:13.134 --> 10:15.049
ten kilometers
to my school and back.

10:15.092 --> 10:18.487
Without food, without water,
without complaining.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.446
Sometimes, when
I'd get hungry,

10:21.490 --> 10:24.536
I used to walk into a clover
field and eat clovers with salt.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.799
Where'd you get the salt?

10:25.842 --> 10:28.149
Don't engage him.
That's what he wants.

10:28.976 --> 10:29.977
Uber for Nate?

10:30.020 --> 10:31.413
Finally.What?

10:31.456 --> 10:33.720
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You, keep driving.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.373
You, give me your phone.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.769
Now, to answer your question,
I always carried salt

10:39.813 --> 10:42.554
and a knife in case
I passed a cucumber field.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.295
Do you have any salt
on you now?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.428
Dude, what are you doing?

10:52.347 --> 10:54.654
I still think about him.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.960
Still miss him.
Still love him.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.048
Course you do.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.878
A year ago, this would have
knocked me on my ass.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.663
Well, that's a good thing.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.055
Is it?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.883
I feel kind of bad about it.

11:06.927 --> 11:11.105
Look, one of the things about
grief is you get used to it.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.324
Get used to having it around.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.587
Sometimes you feel like
it's the only thing

11:15.631 --> 11:17.807
keeping you connected
to that person.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.506
And, hey,
the other thing about grief?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.379
Makes no sense.

11:24.422 --> 11:27.382
Just when you think
you're done with it, boom,

11:27.425 --> 11:29.906
you're weeping at the car wash
for no reason.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.256
You love the car wash.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.084
It's a great place to cry.

11:35.042 --> 11:39.220
Very loud and there's
lots of water on the ground.

11:40.395 --> 11:45.182
So, don't feel bad
about not feeling bad.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.271
You'll feel bad again.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.230
Even worse than you think.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.101
Promise?

11:51.145 --> 11:52.450

11:52.494 --> 11:55.410

You're gonna be a mess.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.239
Thanks, Dad.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.373
All right.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.679
Here we go.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.725

see me in the parade?

12:06.551 --> 12:08.118
You gonna be behind the horses?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.772

none of our pants are buttoned.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.640
So you getting
back out there?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.903
Nah, I'm hoping to
patch things up with Vanessa.

12:53.947 --> 12:54.861

If you want to talk...

13:21.583 --> 13:23.454

13:26.153 --> 13:29.809
So, what's the deal with Holly?
She single?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.028
Hope she likes guys that live
with their grandmother.

I never thought it would
be worse being out.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.435
You've only been out six months.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.829
I still haven't told
my parents I'm out.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.703

Yes, but in Afghanistan, we
called it Going to Your In-Laws.

talking about the game

to her in-laws in real life.
