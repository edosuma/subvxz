00:00.031 --> 00:02.934
Why is an SS Officer coming here?

00:02.936 --> 00:07.580
You'll be working closely with Dr. Huth.

00:07.582 --> 00:10.549
We're going to be busy.

00:10.551 --> 00:12.208
It's Barbara Barga, New York Times.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.802
American. A journalist.

00:14.804 --> 00:15.987
And a liar.

00:15.989 --> 00:17.846
Jimmy, I need you to check on someone.

00:17.848 --> 00:19.940
Draw a pistol and keep your wits about you.

00:19.942 --> 00:21.892
- What are they going to do?
- I don't know.

00:21.894 --> 00:25.006
- Who are they?
- Heroes, not collaborators like you lot!

00:25.008 --> 00:27.366
- He's called John Spode.
- He's after Douggie.

00:27.368 --> 00:28.749
Why would he want your son, sir?

00:28.751 --> 00:30.480
John Spode is Resistance.

00:30.482 --> 00:32.726
They want to control me and
get to me through my son.

Headmaster.

00:59.721 --> 01:02.705
So vital we keep up our standards.

Yes.

01:13.491 --> 01:14.926
Enjoying the show?

01:16.042 --> 01:18.443
A hymn about a patriotic sacrifice.

01:19.225 --> 01:20.535
How quaint.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.898
Where's the man in charge?

01:23.900 --> 01:25.480
What's the meaning of this outrage?

01:25.482 --> 01:27.760
Outrage? Please.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.440
Don't talk to me like that.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.664
It sets such a bad example.

01:31.666 --> 01:32.738
Who are you?

01:32.740 --> 01:34.260
I'm the headmaster.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.080
Where is he?

01:37.080 --> 01:38.680
Speak up!

01:38.680 --> 01:41.168
A man called John Spode. With one arm.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.467
He's working with the choir.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.236
The new fellow? He... I don't know.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.952
He... He's due here, he might be somewhere.

01:46.954 --> 01:48.721
Then we must find him.

01:48.723 --> 01:50.995
The man is a suspected Resistance fighter.

01:50.997 --> 01:53.150
Then, of course, I hope you find him.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.773
The area is being secured.

01:57.775 --> 02:00.200
Sir, the SS is not needed here.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.225
Spode is the subject of my investigation,

02:02.227 --> 02:05.171
I must insist that his civil
liberties are not infringed.

02:05.173 --> 02:06.542
I will be the one to take him into custody.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.792
Come on, Superintendent.
You'll have scared him away.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.925
But we'll have a thorough
check all the same.

02:11.927 --> 02:13.198
We are here to help...

02:13.200 --> 02:15.400
not shoot him, if that's what you fear.

02:21.383 --> 02:24.100
This man Spode, I don't know him.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.182
Tell them!

02:25.614 --> 02:27.841
You're working with them, I know you are.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.403
Tell them I'm innocent!

02:29.997 --> 02:33.921
My God, man, are you going
to just stand there and watch?

02:43.168 --> 02:44.274
Sir.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.813
Douggie. Douggie come here.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.786
Have you heard anything more
from your secretary, Sylvia?

03:13.788 --> 03:16.752
I know about the Trafalgar Square business.

03:16.754 --> 03:18.549
You were followed, of course.

03:18.551 --> 03:19.591
Of course.

03:21.308 --> 03:23.712
But surely she was followed too?

03:23.714 --> 03:26.595
The man assigned to her
was not experienced enough.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.197
Not for an agent like her.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.790
You did not realise? A man like you?

03:36.623 --> 03:38.806
We should have put her in the
bag when we had the chance.

03:38.808 --> 03:40.764
She smelled trouble and got out.

03:40.766 --> 03:42.446
Or perhaps someone warned her.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.016
Stay here.

03:52.953 --> 03:56.553
Ah, Sergeant. You can take
Inspector Archer's son home for him.

03:56.555 --> 03:57.955
We have work to do.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.685
Where's Mrs. Sheenan?

06:11.778 --> 06:13.210
She's gone to collect Bob.

06:14.293 --> 06:17.633
The bastards are down at the
school, ransacking the place, I hear.

06:20.108 --> 06:21.504
Can I go to Tim's?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.928
No, you're going nowhere.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.649
- But why?
- Because I said.

06:39.611 --> 06:40.891
Thanks, Harry.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.147
Glad you could trust me for something.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.395
Why didn't you tell me
you were onto this Spode?

06:53.420 --> 06:55.025
You know damn well why.

06:55.027 --> 06:59.177
You trust that bloody kid
Dunn more than you trust me.

07:00.216 --> 07:02.736
And I've known you for 15 years.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.581
If you'd have just called me,

07:06.583 --> 07:08.438
we could have rolled this up,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.573
without those Nazis terrorising kids

07:11.575 --> 07:12.952
in a church, for God's sake!

07:12.954 --> 07:15.216
Do you think that was
the last thing I wanted?

07:15.218 --> 07:16.544
Spode's Resistance,

07:16.546 --> 07:19.730
and I wasn't sure you wouldn't put
your country above a friendship.

07:24.113 --> 07:25.393
I wouldn't blame you.

07:27.936 --> 07:29.644
One thing I will tell you...

07:30.837 --> 07:32.195
...that kid, Dunn...

07:33.131 --> 07:36.755
...he doesn't have the experience
to handle a case like this.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.757
It's too dangerous.

07:41.608 --> 07:43.989
Move. It's fine. Don't think about it.

07:50.574 --> 07:51.854
Hello, Mrs. Sheenan.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.174
The children were held back.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.691
Processed.

07:57.693 --> 07:59.173
Some older ones taken away.

08:01.070 --> 08:02.470
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:07.268 --> 08:08.708
Take off your coat.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.770
Mrs. Sheenan?

08:17.770 --> 08:21.086
I'm going to The Two
Brewers with Sergeant Woods.

08:21.088 --> 08:22.888
Don't answer the door to anyone.

08:38.514 --> 08:39.850
What is it you want?

08:39.850 --> 08:41.370
Hmm?

08:41.370 --> 08:43.174
No Resistance?

08:43.176 --> 08:44.943
No hope? Huh?

08:46.242 --> 08:51.550
What I want is PC Dunn as well
as you working on this case.

08:51.552 --> 08:53.712
Young blood. All right?

08:56.164 --> 09:00.038
Christ, did you see the way
Mrs. Sheenan looked at me?

09:01.538 --> 09:02.858
And she likes me.

09:04.149 --> 09:06.088
Yeah, you're in a pickle all right.

09:06.331 --> 09:08.490
But what are you going to do, resign?

09:08.490 --> 09:11.204
Get your work permit, your
ration book taken away?

09:11.206 --> 09:13.913
- You've got a son.
- Don't I know it.

09:13.915 --> 09:16.359
Murderers need catching.
That's what you've always said,

09:16.361 --> 09:17.867
and that's what you should keep doing,

09:17.869 --> 09:20.149
cos you are Archer of the Yard, aren't you?

09:20.850 --> 09:22.210
Piss off, Harry.

09:26.704 --> 09:30.325
Oh, I nearly forgot. You got an invitation.

09:30.327 --> 09:32.407
Do you remember someone
called Sydney Garin?

09:33.770 --> 09:36.143
Yeah, little Armenian art dealer.

09:36.145 --> 09:39.274
Yeah, Graf von Garin now.

09:39.778 --> 09:42.150
Famous expert on Aryan art.

09:42.152 --> 09:46.718
Sell paintings, art treasures
to the Germans... sell for them.

09:48.292 --> 09:50.287
Anyway, he phoned and invited you

09:50.289 --> 09:52.816
to some big do tomorrow night.

09:52.818 --> 09:53.858
Black tie.

09:54.282 --> 09:58.290
Oh, that's new. I wonder
what he's got planned for me.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.012
Well, maybe you shouldn't go.

10:04.078 --> 10:05.628
An antique dealer might know something

10:05.630 --> 10:07.453
about the Shepherd Market murder.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.042
Or maybe he thinks you're
in with the Germans,

10:12.054 --> 10:13.574
just like he is.

10:14.845 --> 10:16.570
I'm worried about you, Doug.

10:17.521 --> 10:20.510
You walk around with your eyes half-shut.

10:21.637 --> 10:24.203
You don't see the changes,
you don't see what we've lost,

10:24.205 --> 10:25.816
and it's only going to get worse.

10:25.818 --> 10:29.412
And you don't trust me.

10:30.478 --> 10:32.440
And you can't trust yourself.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.520
You're wrong, Harry.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.478
You know, being Huth's man...

10:43.106 --> 10:45.106
...doesn't look good to some people.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.999
You be careful out there, on the streets.

10:50.945 --> 10:52.305
Thanks for the beer.

11:05.071 --> 11:07.231
So good of you to come and see me.

11:13.165 --> 11:17.357
There. Fantastic. Yes, fantastic.

11:39.043 --> 11:42.074
How do you find, er, Standartenfuhrer Huth?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.039
Enigmatic.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.088
Yes.

11:47.564 --> 11:51.600
Well, the Shepherd Market murder
seems to have piqued his interest.

11:53.766 --> 11:57.486
I understand that he's
trying to piece together

11:57.587 --> 12:01.756
some charred remains of
some documents you found.

12:01.758 --> 12:03.604
You expect him to find anything?

12:03.606 --> 12:05.726
It would be easier to put
Humpty Dumpty back together.

12:05.783 --> 12:07.063
Humpty Dumpty!

12:08.004 --> 12:09.084
What is that?

12:45.075 --> 12:47.555
This is your famous Archer, yes?

12:49.513 --> 12:54.338
Perhaps the celebrated policeman
can explain to his confused superior

12:54.340 --> 12:58.454
the niceties of property law
under military occupation.

12:59.482 --> 13:04.174
Well, I have to admit, some of the
niceties elude even me, General.

13:28.259 --> 13:30.410
Military intelligence.

13:31.262 --> 13:32.597
Old von Ruff is disconsolate

13:32.630 --> 13:35.238
that control of Britain will soon be passed

13:35.240 --> 13:37.960
from the Commander-in-Chief
of his beloved Army

13:38.069 --> 13:41.031
to a Reichskommissar from our own SS ranks.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.046
Then we'll see who has the King's horses.

13:49.853 --> 13:51.682
Curiously named...

13:51.684 --> 13:53.458
they call it Rotten Row.

13:54.348 --> 13:55.905
Blame the French.

13:56.694 --> 13:58.040
Rue de Roi.

13:58.774 --> 14:00.716
Rue de Roi.

14:02.036 --> 14:03.375
Rotten Row.

14:12.178 --> 14:14.018
They must have known something.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.632
Scientific formulae.

14:32.316 --> 14:35.268
Years of work, probably, and he burned it.

14:36.998 --> 14:39.513
They steal the papers and destroy them.

14:40.781 --> 14:43.597
These Resistance are playing a funny game.

14:47.366 --> 14:50.326
My guess is they'll try
to contact you again soon.

14:50.427 --> 14:53.187
Probably not the girl
next time, could be anyone.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.534
Say yes to whatever they want.

14:56.389 --> 14:57.709
Get their proposition.

14:59.560 --> 15:02.178
Their proposition was to kidnap my son.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.684
To blackmail you.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.560
Show them they can trust you.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.160
They'd do better by negotiation
than by terror attacks.

15:10.179 --> 15:12.388
I want to control this situation.

15:12.435 --> 15:15.080
And will the Resistance really
do better by negotiating?

15:15.636 --> 15:18.400
Well, that's what I want you to tell them.

15:18.503 --> 15:20.129
I'm a reasonable man.

15:20.201 --> 15:21.653
Let me hear their demands.

15:22.793 --> 15:25.867
Whoever gives me Spode can expect favours.

15:27.033 --> 15:31.170
15 Resistance men are due to be
hanged... or not, if I intercede.

15:31.226 --> 15:33.189
They should know that.

15:34.603 --> 15:35.803
Yeah?

15:45.621 --> 15:47.781
We have a tip-off about your secretary.

16:06.614 --> 16:07.694
Is this her?

16:09.101 --> 16:10.080
Yes.

16:14.685 --> 16:16.005
I'll check the roof.

16:26.805 --> 16:28.323
Can't get away this time.

16:29.397 --> 16:31.796
I suppose you've brought
your friends to catch me?

16:32.867 --> 16:35.562
Did you help John Spode go after my son?

16:36.929 --> 16:38.569
I warned you, didn't I?

16:39.034 --> 16:41.350
- I told you.
- What were you thinking?

16:41.352 --> 16:43.459
Douggie would have been safe with me.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.101
John wouldn't have harmed him.

16:45.924 --> 16:47.595
How the hell would you know?

16:49.307 --> 16:50.367
Sie bleiben hier.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.880
Anything?

17:00.041 --> 17:01.989
The door was damned hard to open.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.833
So she wouldn't have been able to?

17:04.865 --> 17:05.890
No.

17:17.413 --> 17:20.329
Did you know she was
modelling for this decadent?

17:21.517 --> 17:23.079
She's full of surprises.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.160
She has friends in low places, this Sylvia.

17:31.610 --> 17:35.557
Meet me at the Ministry of
Information tomorrow, 1600 hours.

18:02.117 --> 18:05.346
A routine check uncovered
a Resistance vehicle.

18:05.378 --> 18:07.858
A film can was hidden
inside the spare wheel.

18:08.819 --> 18:09.859
Have a seat.

18:10.101 --> 18:11.261
Film ab, bitte.

18:21.354 --> 18:25.169
<i>As the citizens of benighted
Europe are drafted en masse</i>

18:25.171 --> 18:27.054
<i>into the German war machine,</i>

18:27.056 --> 18:30.216
<i>Uncle Sam considers
which way to turn.</i>

18:31.827 --> 18:35.064
<i>Great Britain is pinning
its hopes on this gentleman.</i>

18:35.066 --> 18:38.221
<i>"I'm your man!" says
Rear Admiral Connolly.</i>

18:38.825 --> 18:42.505
<i>He claims to be the representative
of the British nation,</i>

18:42.507 --> 18:45.375
<i>confirmed by Prime
Minister Winston Churchill</i>

18:45.377 --> 18:48.069
<i>before his rumoured execution.</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:52.752
<i>But lawyers for Herr Hitler
are denying his claims.</i>

18:52.754 --> 18:57.645
<i>They want to take control of the
British Embassy in Washington.</i>

18:57.700 --> 19:01.151
<i>Good luck, Admiral...
you're going to need it.</i>

19:07.203 --> 19:09.385
Such even-handed reporting.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.138
This is two weeks old.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.376
The only way it could have
been smuggled into the country

19:15.378 --> 19:17.799
was on board the inaugural
flight from New York.

19:25.344 --> 19:27.774
So there was a sympathiser
on board the plane?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.667
I think that's an SS matter,
sir, not police business.

19:37.035 --> 19:41.138
I happen to know that an American
reporter from that flight,

19:41.140 --> 19:42.994
a Miss Barbara Barga,

19:42.996 --> 19:46.040
has been asking questions
about you of our press attache.

19:48.389 --> 19:52.180
Well, I suppose I make an
interesting story for outsiders.

19:53.883 --> 19:58.233
All encounters with her I
will expect to be reported.

19:59.535 --> 20:00.788
Understood?

20:07.255 --> 20:10.855
Any progress in your
investigation, any hunches?

20:13.911 --> 20:16.031
Nothing worthy of your attention, sir.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.421
Don't let me detain you, then.

21:38.139 --> 21:41.219
You have a wonderful Turner
there, Superintendent.

21:41.221 --> 21:43.358
Mr. Garin. Good of you to invite me.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.783
Oh, you're particularly
welcome, Superintendent.

21:45.785 --> 21:47.716
Quite a melange tonight.

21:47.718 --> 21:50.238
Everyone here except the Prime Minister.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.236
I've seen this before.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.199
Ah, what a memory you have.

21:56.201 --> 21:57.801
It once belonged to the Tate.

21:57.803 --> 21:59.358
And now it's for sale?

21:59.360 --> 22:02.560
Well, all the museums
have to get rid of things.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.394
No more state subsidies,

22:05.396 --> 22:07.266
can't expect the German administration

22:07.268 --> 22:10.028
to finance our art museums, can we?

22:10.157 --> 22:11.517
Oh, God, no.

22:12.299 --> 22:16.093
We find it cleaner and more
business-like to buy from museums

22:16.095 --> 22:19.463
then re-sell to our
clients in our own time.

22:20.259 --> 22:22.579
Well, and more profitable
too, I should imagine.

22:23.804 --> 22:25.980
The mind of a policeman.

22:28.301 --> 22:30.368
Something a little more specialist?

22:30.697 --> 22:34.440
Some of our German friends can't
get enough of the occult stuff.

22:34.564 --> 22:36.305
We had half a notion
that Herr Himmler himself

22:36.307 --> 22:38.881
was going to grace us with
his presence this evening.

22:39.494 --> 22:41.986
- Himmler's in London?
- So they say.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.520
Well, I hope the
Resistance don't hear that.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.382
They'd probably launch a mortar attack.

22:46.384 --> 22:47.723
Garin, good evening.

22:47.725 --> 22:51.153
Of course, you know Bernard
Staines from Oxford days.

22:51.794 --> 22:53.005
- Hello.
- Bernard.

22:53.052 --> 22:55.679
I was coach of the eight
when Douglas got his blue.

22:55.681 --> 22:58.118
Yes, I never see you at the
Oxford and Cambridge, Douglas.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.888
Well, these days people like to go
to their clubs and let their hair down

23:00.890 --> 23:02.840
without worrying a
policeman might be listening.

23:02.842 --> 23:05.335
- If you'll excuse me, gentlemen?
- Good, good.

23:05.337 --> 23:08.792
Yes, well, if anyone thinks he
can relax anywhere in this town

23:08.794 --> 23:11.512
without a block warden or a
policeman listening to him,

23:11.536 --> 23:12.819
he's a fool.

23:12.861 --> 23:14.221
You're right, Bernard.

23:14.338 --> 23:16.018
And don't you forget it.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.289
Things will get better.

23:18.422 --> 23:20.062
But only if we make them better.

23:22.927 --> 23:24.495
And how would we do that?

23:26.271 --> 23:27.511
Do you really want to know?

23:29.342 --> 23:30.560
Yes, I do.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.264
Good. Well, then, maybe we
should have a chat later.

23:35.377 --> 23:37.406
There's someone here I'd like you to meet.

23:37.408 --> 23:38.564
Of course.

23:38.566 --> 23:40.467
Splendid. I'll catch you.

24:14.892 --> 24:16.336
Hello, Miss Barga.

24:18.522 --> 24:19.996
What a nice surprise.

24:23.353 --> 24:25.553
You may compliment me on the dress.

24:25.752 --> 24:29.240
It's a Laurenti from Paris,
cost me three months' salary.

24:31.697 --> 24:33.178
It left me speechless.

24:34.475 --> 24:37.116
Nice recovery, Superintendent.

24:37.118 --> 24:38.838
Are you buying tonight?

24:39.111 --> 24:41.661
Sadly, I've no more space on my walls.

24:42.478 --> 24:44.238
Though I do like the Turners.

24:44.675 --> 24:47.075
Apparently it's being shipped
off to Goering tomorrow.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.884
And he's getting eight or
nine decadent surrealist pieces

24:50.886 --> 24:53.142
confiscated from non-Aryan owners.

24:53.385 --> 24:55.825
He plays the game well, does Garin.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.126
Smooth as silk and twice as slippery.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.894
But he sure knows how to throw a party.

25:03.474 --> 25:05.573
Takes me back to my days in high school.

25:07.390 --> 25:09.310
In the Midwest?

25:09.442 --> 25:10.682
Wisconsin.

25:10.854 --> 25:13.454
My boyfriend was on the football
team and I was a cheerleader.

25:17.429 --> 25:19.470
Well, I suppose you
know how to dance, then.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.332
We could give it a try.

25:30.341 --> 25:32.788
♪ Never stray ♪

25:32.837 --> 25:35.845
♪ From my side ♪

25:35.847 --> 25:38.941
♪ If you love me... ♪

25:41.943 --> 25:44.143
Say, you're good, Superintendent!

25:45.002 --> 25:48.158
Well, you mustn't believe everything
you read about policeman and their feet.

25:49.605 --> 25:51.725
I used to dance quite a lot at one time.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.385
I heard about your wife, Superintendent.

25:57.357 --> 25:58.957
That's a terrible thing.

26:00.043 --> 26:01.523
And you have a little boy too.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.360
I'm not alone in misfortune.

26:05.443 --> 26:07.357
I like that you still wear the ring.

26:09.619 --> 26:11.846
So you've been making enquiries about me?

26:13.937 --> 26:15.497
It's a part of the job.

26:15.733 --> 26:17.474
Though I should have caught your name

26:17.523 --> 26:19.603
and realised you were Archer of the Yard.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.797
Do you mind not being recognised?

26:31.280 --> 26:33.240
Not being recognised is part of my job.

26:36.910 --> 26:39.630
So what happened to the
football player in Wisconsin?

26:40.581 --> 26:41.901
I married him.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.257
Any progress on that murder case?

26:46.110 --> 26:50.381
But what the hell, you didn't ask me to
dance to talk about murder cases, did you?

26:50.383 --> 26:50.919
Well, I...

26:50.921 --> 26:54.041
I'm going to be very offended if
you say yes to that one, mister.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.187
Are you still married?

27:01.840 --> 27:03.360
Now, that's more like it.

27:07.712 --> 27:09.432
I love this song, you know that?

27:16.678 --> 27:20.300
♪ Never stray from my side ♪

27:20.358 --> 27:22.678
♪ If you love me ♪

27:24.403 --> 27:30.340
♪ Do not hasten to bid me adieu. ♪

27:37.982 --> 27:39.782
Don't go home without me, will you?

28:09.371 --> 28:10.651
Excuse me.

28:20.475 --> 28:23.415
Thank you for tearing
yourself away from Miss Barga.

28:23.468 --> 28:24.988
You know her?

28:25.050 --> 28:27.599
Yeah, I've spent a bit of
time in Washington and, er...

28:28.160 --> 28:29.520
she's a popular girl.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.626
And you seem popular with her.

28:34.317 --> 28:35.637
Married woman.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.120
Divorcee.

28:49.678 --> 28:52.518
Hello, Archer. Good to see you.

28:55.146 --> 28:56.506
Colonel Mayhew.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.400
How's your friend Harry Woods?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.692
Useful prop, back when I used to play.

29:00.694 --> 29:03.051
Grumpy. He's finding it difficult.

29:03.145 --> 29:04.665
Difficult for us all.

29:07.794 --> 29:12.052
I wonder, have the family
factories been taken by the Germans?

29:12.054 --> 29:14.160
Just a question of time, my boy.

29:14.198 --> 29:15.678
A question of time.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.684
It's bridge. Penny a point.

29:24.686 --> 29:25.969
Never thought I'd see the day

29:26.027 --> 29:30.212
when I'd have to start an evening
like this with a pack of used cards.

29:32.009 --> 29:32.669
Archer.

29:32.699 --> 29:35.250
We met at a counterintelligence
briefing before the war.

29:35.282 --> 29:37.632
Mayhew here reminded me.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.708
There's no man I'd rather
have with us this evening.

29:42.730 --> 29:44.400
Thank you, Sir Robert.

29:44.514 --> 29:46.720
But I'm afraid bridge isn't my strong suit.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.377
Whist, then.

29:49.584 --> 29:50.880
Wonderful.

29:50.949 --> 29:53.598
Haven't played whist since the trenches.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.650
Thank you.

29:54.652 --> 29:57.994
I have the character flaw of only
enjoying cards if it's for money.

29:58.027 --> 30:02.236
Awkward, as Cabinet Secretary, if
it came out... hence the secrecy.

30:17.881 --> 30:21.135
Well, our host seems to be
nicely in with the Germans.

30:21.137 --> 30:24.822
It may be that Mr. Garin's
closeness with the Germans

30:24.858 --> 30:27.564
isn't entirely selfish.

30:27.566 --> 30:29.046
I had wondered.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.873
In light of present company.

30:32.912 --> 30:36.240
At least with a pack of cards,
you can understand the rankings.

30:36.242 --> 30:38.128
With the Germans I find
it quite mystifying.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.948
SS, SD...

30:39.950 --> 30:41.597
Gestapo, Wehrmacht.

30:41.659 --> 30:43.353
You're probably the best-placed
Briton in the country

30:43.371 --> 30:45.544
to have any understanding of this, Archer.

30:45.583 --> 30:46.686
What a thing to be.

30:46.688 --> 30:49.728
I'm guessing that the SS
are trumps. Would you agree?

30:51.253 --> 30:52.718
Not exactly.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.264
Yes, they can only be
tried in their own court,

30:55.266 --> 30:58.346
but the same is true of
the German armed forces.

30:58.348 --> 30:59.662
The SS can't touch them.

30:59.664 --> 31:01.825
Come along, we're playing cards.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.376
I'm glad that you confirm that.

31:05.431 --> 31:09.085
Some of the army chaps have
been most helpful to us.

31:09.087 --> 31:12.636
With the Gestapo on their tail, they
might have to be more circumspect.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.880
Some of the army are anti-Hitler?

31:19.081 --> 31:20.960
Prussians aristocrats, mostly.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.560
Old-school.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.040
Can't abide the SS and
their bully-boy ways.

31:25.101 --> 31:29.848
And, erm, what about these
fellows with honorary SS ranks?

31:29.896 --> 31:33.555
Well, Himmler uses those to
muzzle and bribe his opponents.

31:33.672 --> 31:36.926
Some of those men are
his most bitter enemies.

31:40.483 --> 31:41.664
God, I've made a trick.

31:41.666 --> 31:46.776
So the SS is divided within itself
and at war with the German Army?

31:47.668 --> 31:49.423
And yet they managed to beat us.

31:51.901 --> 31:56.395
What about this fellow countryman
of ours, Rear Admiral Connolly?

31:58.786 --> 32:00.453
Well, he's a cool customer.

32:01.543 --> 32:04.572
To walk off an aircraft
carrier in Nova Scotia

32:04.574 --> 32:07.408
and declare yourself the
leader of Free Britain...

32:08.583 --> 32:11.024
...and yet he's only a
Commander on the Naval List.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.385
And the rest are ours, I think.

32:17.419 --> 32:18.459
Oh.

32:20.499 --> 32:21.899
Mm.

32:26.944 --> 32:28.037
Thank you.

32:28.641 --> 32:32.004
Remember that French
Army officer, de Gaulle?

32:32.017 --> 32:33.680
He escaped to England when France fell.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.277
He did more or less the
same thing, as I remember...

32:36.279 --> 32:37.575
promoted himself to General

32:37.577 --> 32:39.657
and declared himself the voice of France.

32:41.237 --> 32:42.956
But it never really came to anything.

32:42.958 --> 32:44.668
This is different.

32:44.670 --> 32:47.828
Connolly was acting on the
instructions of the War Cabinet.

32:48.018 --> 32:50.817
It was Winston's idea,

32:50.819 --> 32:53.445
when he himself refused to
go on one of the flying boats

32:53.447 --> 32:55.727
that left for Iceland at the very end.

32:56.325 --> 32:57.565
So I heard.

32:58.369 --> 33:01.836
But no-one on this side of the
Atlantic really knows anything about it.

33:01.838 --> 33:05.390
That's less important than
shoring Connolly up for now.

33:05.481 --> 33:07.571
His position in Washington is tenuous.

33:07.573 --> 33:11.194
It's dicey. The Germans
might take over our Embassy,

33:11.196 --> 33:14.320
and that would be a bad blow for
Connolly's prestige over there.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.138
So you're in touch with him?

33:22.880 --> 33:26.094
Have you heard the rumours
that the King is unwell?

33:27.582 --> 33:29.054
Some people are saying he's been moved

33:29.056 --> 33:31.296
from the Tower of London to St. George's.

33:35.541 --> 33:38.841
Well, I know there's an SS
Special Security Battalion

33:38.843 --> 33:41.542
that's been quartered beside
it at Hyde Park Corner.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.000
It's quite a force.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.560
You can't be thinking
of trying to free him?

34:06.946 --> 34:08.106
Of course not.

34:10.771 --> 34:12.733
Why was I invited here this evening?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.643
Is there some connection with
the Shepherd Market murder?

34:16.645 --> 34:19.447
Let's just stay on track, shall we?

34:19.449 --> 34:21.221
We need nothing of you.

34:21.523 --> 34:23.842
Except loyalty to your country.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.091
We're at the knife's edge.

34:29.745 --> 34:31.842
What about this fellow Huth?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.597
Could he be of value to us?

34:33.599 --> 34:34.782
In what venture?

34:36.755 --> 34:39.000
There's bad blood between
him and General Kellermann,

34:39.069 --> 34:41.449
they loathe each other,
but how can that help you?

34:41.481 --> 34:43.081
We just want to open channels,

34:43.166 --> 34:45.206
as we have with the German Army.

34:48.146 --> 34:49.466
That's what he wants.

34:50.731 --> 34:52.574
Though it could easily be a trap.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.980
He wanted me to be "open to offers".

35:01.577 --> 35:03.017
Well, do you trust him?

35:04.154 --> 35:05.234
Could he be...

35:06.205 --> 35:07.443
...useful to us?

35:09.298 --> 35:12.878
Well, I don't know him. He's
clever, but unpredictable.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.280
And Kellermann?

35:14.357 --> 35:16.237
Predictable and not so clever?

35:17.629 --> 35:19.669
I think that's the way
he'd like to be seen.

35:21.413 --> 35:24.693
Harry Woods calls them Laurel and Hardy.

35:24.764 --> 35:26.871
God, and we're occupied by them.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.497
I'll be the go-between.

35:34.364 --> 35:35.684
Tell me what I have to do.

35:36.230 --> 35:37.974
Now, wait a minute. Bernard...

35:39.109 --> 35:40.336
Let's...

35:41.458 --> 35:43.491
I need to get to know him better.

35:44.082 --> 35:45.842
This is a massive risk to take.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.720
Well, we...

35:48.874 --> 35:51.182
We all of us have to take risks, Douglas.

35:51.184 --> 35:53.748
We've taken one by telling
you as much as we have.

36:04.406 --> 36:05.766
You have nothing to fear.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.665
I think that's enough for tonight.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.044
I have to get going.

36:15.199 --> 36:16.479
Ah, just a moment.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.160
These gentlemen owe us money.

36:20.868 --> 36:22.068
Cough up, Staines.

36:24.860 --> 36:26.180
Thank you, Sir Robert.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.120
Thank you.

36:43.986 --> 36:46.386
All those terrible people there tonight.

36:47.827 --> 36:50.399
I've seen the same sort
of greedy-eyed politicians

36:50.455 --> 36:52.417
from Chaco to Addis Ababa.

36:52.957 --> 36:55.397
Brown shirts, red shirts, black shirts...

36:55.399 --> 36:57.248
They're all after the same thing.

36:57.297 --> 36:59.962
Coloured shirts?

36:59.964 --> 37:03.510
That... and grabbing as much
of the world as possible.

37:05.107 --> 37:07.222
Sounds like you've been in a lot of wars.

37:10.732 --> 37:13.372
I was 18 when my paper
sent me down to Paraguay

37:13.374 --> 37:15.469
to cover the fighting in Chaco.

37:15.925 --> 37:21.978
Since then, I've filed stories
from China, Ethiopia, Spain.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.279
And last year, I was in Abbeville when
the German Panzer Divisions arrived.

37:27.797 --> 37:29.984
- It's a strange job for a woman.
- Oh!

37:29.986 --> 37:32.266
Don't be such an English stuffed shirt!

37:40.284 --> 37:42.604
So you were 18 when you saw your first war?

37:45.323 --> 37:46.763
What did your father say?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.651
He owned the newspaper.

37:50.279 --> 37:51.319
Ah.

37:56.861 --> 37:58.365
And you...

37:59.040 --> 38:01.043
You went into the police force?

38:01.670 --> 38:03.190
Is this off the record?

38:04.669 --> 38:06.119
You can trust me.

38:11.019 --> 38:13.019
I wanted to set the world to rights.

38:14.421 --> 38:16.438
Hold the front page.

38:16.471 --> 38:17.511
I know.

38:24.623 --> 38:27.383
This isn't the way to The Dorchester.

38:27.478 --> 38:29.598
Who said I was still there?

38:29.676 --> 38:31.115
I'm renting now.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.233
My lady.

38:51.153 --> 38:52.248
I'd ask you in for a drink,

38:52.265 --> 38:55.038
but they need the cars
back for the other guests.

38:55.525 --> 38:56.805
That's all right.

38:57.089 --> 38:59.052
I can phone the Yard for a car.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.810
Your own car. You must be important.

39:01.871 --> 39:03.813
That's what people keep telling me.

39:10.149 --> 39:13.797
You know they've had 14 break-ins
along here in the last three months.

39:13.799 --> 39:15.980
Well, I can stand by
the window if you like.

39:17.722 --> 39:20.022
Well, this looks like a
suite at the Dorchester.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.004
But a lot more private.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.575
Only problem is it's cold.

39:35.236 --> 39:36.516
Let me.

39:43.821 --> 39:45.701
Coffee, Superintendent?

39:45.772 --> 39:47.692
Douglas, please.

39:47.794 --> 39:50.138
People are calling me Douglas now.

39:50.202 --> 39:52.408
It's all part of the
new mood of informality

39:52.410 --> 39:54.810
that the newspapers say that war brought.

39:56.262 --> 39:57.582
Douglas, eh?

39:58.340 --> 40:00.770
I think I like that
better than Superintendent.

40:02.330 --> 40:04.130
So would you?

40:04.161 --> 40:06.161
Would I what?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.637
Like coffee?

40:10.049 --> 40:12.529
I have real grinds.
They're hard to come by.

40:14.717 --> 40:16.677
How real is your brandy?

40:16.880 --> 40:18.818
Plenty real. Bring it over.

40:44.825 --> 40:46.993
Winter in this town is going to kill me

40:46.995 --> 40:49.528
if I don't find some way of keeping warm.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.722
Maybe there I can help?

41:02.257 --> 41:04.137
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:16.581 --> 41:18.274
See how freezing I am?

41:20.412 --> 41:22.166
Maybe you're cold blooded.

41:23.071 --> 41:24.581
I must be.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.202
Well, that's cosy.

42:02.677 --> 42:04.349
Don't tear anything.

42:05.930 --> 42:09.335
I might not get another
Paris gown as long as I live.

42:41.159 --> 42:42.852
You're not going?

42:46.423 --> 42:49.482
- I must.
- To go home?

42:50.450 --> 42:52.573
Well, it's a bit early for the office.

42:53.698 --> 42:55.815
Don't be irritable.

42:55.860 --> 42:59.205
I'm just trying to discover
if there's someone else.

43:00.142 --> 43:01.782
Not that I know of.

43:04.068 --> 43:05.943
I have to get back for my son.

43:13.533 --> 43:14.759
Kiss me.

43:37.805 --> 43:40.325
Those people you spoke with tonight...

43:40.327 --> 43:43.441
Sir Robert Benson,
Colonel Mayhew and Staines.

43:44.142 --> 43:45.633
Don't tell them "no."

43:47.131 --> 43:48.408
Tell them "yes."

43:48.410 --> 43:50.372
Tell them "next week,"

43:50.374 --> 43:51.952
or tell them "maybe."

43:52.582 --> 43:54.143
But don't tell them "no."

43:57.076 --> 44:00.391
Was it them who told you to go
along to the antiques shop that day?

44:00.437 --> 44:01.320
No.

44:01.828 --> 44:03.383
Then what were you doing there...

44:04.884 --> 44:07.964
- ...asking about a roll of film?
- Lay off, will you, Doug?

44:13.134 --> 44:15.059
Any other advice for me?

44:17.917 --> 44:21.717
Just that a friend, a guy
who covers the White House,

44:21.771 --> 44:24.036
says that Bernard
Staines met with Roosevelt

44:24.038 --> 44:25.980
three times in the last month.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.889
One of those meetings took
place on the Presidential yacht

44:28.891 --> 44:31.211
and lasted nearly two hours.

44:31.260 --> 44:34.078
These guys are into something big, Douglas.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.710
I'm telling you, don't go
back there and say "no deal."

44:38.381 --> 44:39.741
What if I did?

44:40.956 --> 44:43.237
Then they'd kill you.

44:43.303 --> 44:46.310
You know too much now to be
allowed to stay uncommitted.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.150
Like I said,

44:51.204 --> 44:54.068
I've seen a thousand guys
like this all over the world.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.369
If it came to choosing between your life

44:57.371 --> 45:00.891
and a chance to get US government
recognition of the Connolly set-up,

45:01.229 --> 45:04.109
do you think they would
hesitate for one moment?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.445
Can I use your phone?

45:26.479 --> 45:28.159
CID duty officer.

45:31.574 --> 45:32.466
You fool, Archer!

45:32.468 --> 45:35.440
Why do you think we authorise a
car service for these big parties?

45:35.442 --> 45:37.394
So we know where everyone goes.

45:38.166 --> 45:39.486
Are you still with the girl?

45:42.098 --> 45:43.412
Yes, sir.

45:43.414 --> 45:46.294
Stay there. I'm sending
someone to bring you to me.

46:26.520 --> 46:27.824
Herr Archer.

48:41.893 --> 48:44.560
If you are as clever as I am told...

48:45.725 --> 48:48.965
...you will have deduced how
important this case is to us.

48:50.949 --> 48:53.093
And why would that be?

48:58.451 --> 49:00.554
Spode was an atomic physicist.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.076
It looks like the Resistance killed him

49:03.117 --> 49:05.837
because he was continuing
his work under the Germans.

49:05.907 --> 49:07.653
But not under the SS.

49:08.425 --> 49:10.330
Or Dr. Huth wouldn't need
to bring in his own expert

49:10.332 --> 49:12.979
to determine what caused
those burns on his corneas.

49:13.042 --> 49:13.823
Hmm.

49:16.022 --> 49:17.160
Go on.

49:18.084 --> 49:19.124
Well...

49:20.229 --> 49:23.806
Given the rivalry between
the SS and the Army,

49:23.808 --> 49:26.409
the Army being in control
of a secret atomic programme

49:26.411 --> 49:28.211
puts them in front, doesn't it?

49:29.840 --> 49:33.582
Only if an atom bomb really
is within their grasp.

49:36.510 --> 49:41.627
It would have the ability to wipe
out perhaps even an entire city.

49:42.541 --> 49:45.021
That is why it is imperative

49:45.098 --> 49:47.470
that we find the brother alive.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.488
Schlussene.

50:20.312 --> 50:21.832
The final act.

50:22.725 --> 50:26.005
Your operation to take
control of the atomic bomb.

50:26.067 --> 50:29.910
Precisely. Then the Reich
will be truly invincible.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.160
I was under the impression
you thought you already were.

50:35.668 --> 50:39.396
There's always room
for improvement, Archer.

50:40.645 --> 50:45.045
With Germany holding the super-bomb,
it will be an end to all war...

50:45.113 --> 50:49.152
the final phase of our
ascendency, prosperity and order.

50:50.228 --> 50:52.748
We'll bring our industries here.

50:52.857 --> 50:54.429
Bosch. Siemens.

50:55.684 --> 50:58.292
Your people will be fully employed.

50:58.664 --> 51:01.504
This country will be transformed.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.840
Into what?

51:05.596 --> 51:08.516
There's a standing
instruction, Superintendent.

51:08.518 --> 51:11.318
All senior police officers
provide a contact address,

51:11.320 --> 51:14.507
or phone number, day and night.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.548
Yes.

51:20.150 --> 51:23.091
Come on. I'm going to give you
a lesson you will never forget.

51:31.588 --> 51:34.468
Just wait. You will see
what your friends are like.

51:55.052 --> 51:57.132
This is the area where I used to live.

51:58.957 --> 52:00.597
Why are you bringing me here?

52:11.978 --> 52:13.235
What's going on?

52:14.640 --> 52:15.973
This was my home.

52:56.603 --> 52:57.797
Jimmy!

53:09.186 --> 53:13.070
"I was an English hunting dog,
working for the German huntsmen."

53:13.461 --> 53:15.717
The gallant British patriots.

53:16.126 --> 53:17.473
Are you proud of them?

53:18.549 --> 53:21.149
Don't turn your back,
man. This is your doing!

53:49.444 --> 53:52.337
So at last a flicker of emotion.

53:52.389 --> 53:54.109
I thought I would never see it.

53:57.226 --> 53:59.341
Jimmy was just doing his job.

53:59.358 --> 54:02.558
The gallant patriots of
the Resistance murder him.

54:02.643 --> 54:03.908
And you punch me.

54:04.865 --> 54:06.135
My wife died here!

54:06.170 --> 54:08.652
They were the ones who
chose to put the body here.

54:16.708 --> 54:20.215
- When did they find him?
- 22:47 hours.

54:20.217 --> 54:23.134
Foot patrols on the clock, every two hours.

54:23.136 --> 54:25.979
Not exactly making things
difficult for The Partisans.

54:26.770 --> 54:29.612
This is an announcement
that they intend to kill you

54:29.615 --> 54:32.095
unless you do as they say.
You realise that, don't you?

54:47.094 --> 54:48.414
No feelers yet?

54:50.212 --> 54:52.421
Nobody asked you any subtle questions

54:52.423 --> 54:54.783
about how you like working for the Huns?

54:54.859 --> 54:55.867
No.

54:56.817 --> 54:58.127
Curious.

54:58.603 --> 54:59.874
Since your reputation has grown

54:59.901 --> 55:03.331
I would have expected some whining
and sniffing around you by now.

55:03.370 --> 55:05.954
Yeah, well I'll go home and
wait for a carrier pigeon!

55:06.861 --> 55:09.261
Save your humour for Harry Woods.

55:09.331 --> 55:12.096
Sergeants have to laugh
at their superiors' jokes.

55:14.082 --> 55:17.524
What about Barbara Barga,
the American journalist?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.600
She just wanted a story.

55:29.674 --> 55:32.185
Everybody wants something, it seems.

55:32.899 --> 55:34.571
These are dangerous people.

55:34.573 --> 55:37.333
Don't try and play both
ends against the middle.

55:39.156 --> 55:43.709
Just remember, the axe never
mourns the tree it fells.

56:23.217 --> 56:24.892
Are you all right, Mr. Archer?

56:26.268 --> 56:27.594
Go to bed.

56:39.080 --> 56:40.997
Is it your wife you're thinking of?

56:42.912 --> 56:45.952
- I know how you must feel.
- How can you possibly know...

56:47.595 --> 56:49.235
...how I must feel?

56:51.086 --> 56:53.006
- I'm sorry, I...
- Leave me in peace.

56:54.245 --> 56:55.525
Please.

56:57.113 --> 56:58.172
Yeah.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.487
Jimmy was our last boy left.

57:31.555 --> 57:34.275
- Whoever did this...
- No, it was you, Doug.

57:34.569 --> 57:35.551
You did this.

57:35.553 --> 57:38.914
These people will turn on
anyone they start to doubt.

57:39.720 --> 57:41.054
Let him go!

57:43.751 --> 57:46.523
What the hell are you doing here
with German Army Intelligence?

57:48.635 --> 57:50.835
I'm hoping to make an arrest, Captain.

57:53.571 --> 57:55.858
Listen to me! Listen to
me! We don't have much time.

57:55.909 --> 57:57.436
I'm not a spy, Douglas.

57:57.453 --> 57:59.453
I hear people lie to me all the time.
