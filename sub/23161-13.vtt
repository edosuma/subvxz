WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.625
You're Cousin Higgins.

00:01.702 --> 00:06.139
Pull me a beer, love,
let me sit on me tush
before I bloody drop.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.199
Oh, my God.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.573
Higgins has really been
looking forward to your visit.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.169
He wants to work me over.
You think I should
let him do it?

00:13.247 --> 00:14.908
But I can't tell you
all he's done for me

00:14.982 --> 00:16.472
I, I, I, I, I...
I, I, I, I, I, I, I...

00:16.550 --> 00:19.519
Stop! You and I have
a communication problem.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.488
I am simply trying
to help Sally have
what she desires,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.046
Mr. Timothy Finch.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.093
If you talk to Mrs. Finch
in your own words...

00:26.160 --> 00:30.153
I'm sick of the whole
confused, posh, snooty,
bloody lot of you.

From date-nut puffs
to our hospital fund goal
in just 90 days!

01:58.873 --> 02:03.674
Thanks to our treasurer's
shrewd investment
of our bake sale profit.

02:03.745 --> 02:08.114
No, no, Sydney,
I was just lucky to find
the highest yield.

02:08.183 --> 02:09.979
And I insist that you,
as president,

02:10.050 --> 02:12.019
present our check
to the hospital.

02:12.086 --> 02:14.179
No, indeed!
This is your day.

02:14.255 --> 02:16.348
I'm only here
to take the pictures.

02:16.558 --> 02:18.389
Oh, my goodness.

02:18.459 --> 02:20.586
Would you look at the crowd!

02:20.662 --> 02:23.096
All our membership
said they'd be here

02:23.164 --> 02:25.132
You get out ahead, Agatha.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.725
We don't want to steal
your thunder.

02:33.841 --> 02:35.365
Miss Chumley?

02:36.678 --> 02:39.613
You represent
this Island Benevolence
Association?

02:39.681 --> 02:41.342
Well, I'm the treasurer.

02:41.416 --> 02:45.409
We're here to collect
our investment
to present it to the hospital.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.177
Yes, I know.

02:47.255 --> 02:50.315
Miss Chumley, I'm Frank Ohmar,
SeaShare Condominiums.

02:50.758 --> 02:54.387
We rented
the Eden Valley Investments'
office last Friday.

02:54.862 --> 02:57.956
They're no longer here.
They went bankrupt.

02:58.032 --> 03:00.057
Bankrupt?
But where did they go?

03:02.270 --> 03:04.431
They have our $10,000!

03:08.710 --> 03:11.076
<i>If you save it</i>
<i>for special occasions,</i>

03:11.145 --> 03:14.774
<i>getting up early is fun.</i>
<i>It's a once-a-month ritual</i>

03:14.849 --> 03:18.376
<i>I watch</i>
<i>a perfect paradise sunrise,</i>
<i>count the rainbows</i>

03:18.453 --> 03:20.580
<i>and beat Higgins</i>
<i>to the mailbox.</i>

03:20.655 --> 03:22.953
<i>I love getting mail, any kind.</i>

03:23.024 --> 03:27.154
<i>The very fact that somebody,</i>
<i>somewhere, licked a stamp</i>
<i>just for me</i>

03:27.228 --> 03:28.525
<i>is reassuring.</i>

03:28.596 --> 03:31.759
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>most of those stamps</i>
<i>are licked by a nasty guy</i>

03:31.833 --> 03:34.063
<i>who signs his name,</i>
<i>"Past Due."</i>

03:34.135 --> 03:37.627
<i>But that's</i>
<i>the great thing about mail.</i>
<i>Just when you least expect it,</i>

03:37.705 --> 03:41.038
<i>your own special delivery</i>
<i>stamp of approval!</i>

03:52.086 --> 03:54.281
I won! Higgins!

03:59.227 --> 04:00.455
Higgins!

04:00.728 --> 04:02.127
I did it! I did it!

04:02.196 --> 04:04.494
Yes, Magnum,
you collected the mail
all by yourself.

04:04.565 --> 04:06.294
We're very proud of him,
aren't we, lads?

04:08.636 --> 04:10.900
No! That's mine!

04:11.906 --> 04:13.464
Higgins, I got fourth place.

04:13.541 --> 04:17.534
The fourth best
Mrs. Perroni's Frozen Pizza
slogan in the entire nation!

04:17.612 --> 04:18.772
I'm numb with awe.

04:18.846 --> 04:21.007
I get a weekend for two
at Disney World!

04:21.082 --> 04:22.982
You'll be leaving
right away, I trust.

04:23.051 --> 04:25.519
Procrastination is unthinkable
when one has the opportunity

04:25.586 --> 04:28.054
of personally meeting
David Duck.

04:28.122 --> 04:31.114
Donald Duck.
And this certificate
is good for one year.

04:31.192 --> 04:33.023
Will you quit trying
to get me off the estate?

04:33.094 --> 04:36.962
Higgins, I already promised
I would not bug
your Aunt Sally. All right?

04:37.031 --> 04:40.125
Cousin Sally,
five times removed.
A remote family tie,

04:40.201 --> 04:42.465
but one I take
great pride in claiming.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.528
Although I've never met her,
I'm sure that Sally Ponting

04:44.605 --> 04:47.165
is a very refined
and well-bred young woman.

04:47.241 --> 04:49.209
And while you do have
certain redeeming traits,

04:49.277 --> 04:51.336
I'm afraid
that your plebeian tastes

04:51.412 --> 04:53.812
and abrasive bombasity
might offend her.

04:53.881 --> 04:54.973
It's not fair!

04:55.049 --> 04:56.949
I'm sorry,
but it's the way I feel.

04:57.018 --> 04:58.542
They're not gonna provide
transportation!

04:58.619 --> 05:01.520
I have to pay my own way
to Florida. Some prize!

05:01.589 --> 05:03.557
Sally will be staying here
until the wedding.

05:03.624 --> 05:06.991
You will please refrain
from visiting the main house
for the duration.

05:07.061 --> 05:09.052
Yes, yes, yes! I heard you!

05:09.130 --> 05:10.620
I won't go
near the main house.

05:10.698 --> 05:12.996
I won't be abrasive
to your Cousin Sally,

05:13.067 --> 05:17.094
and I will never ever again
eat Mrs. Perroni's
Frozen Pizza!

05:27.215 --> 05:29.843
Agatha, what on earth
is the matter?

05:30.985 --> 05:36.890
Oh, Jonathan,
I've been to fool's paradise!

05:38.826 --> 05:41.522
And I need a cup of tea

05:46.567 --> 05:49.866
I'm solely responsible
for the loss.

05:51.839 --> 05:57.106
I just wanted
the highest interest possible
on the I.B.A.'s profits.

05:58.813 --> 06:02.408
Have you considered
replacing the money?

06:02.483 --> 06:06.180
Jonathan,
$10,000 with interest?

06:07.021 --> 06:12.459
Besides, replacing it
isn't going to reinstate me
as a trustworthy treasurer.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.924
No, either the missing funds
are located quickly,

06:17.165 --> 06:19.292
or I resign my post.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.365
Agatha,
there is the possibility

06:22.437 --> 06:27.465
that the condominium salesman
was mistaken about
the Eden Valley bankruptcy.

06:29.644 --> 06:31.839
I do have
some hope of that.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.974
Yes. After you've slept
we'll have another chat
with him,

06:36.050 --> 06:38.416
verify his sources
and proceed from there.

06:38.486 --> 06:39.646
No!

06:40.455 --> 06:44.221
Jonathan, you've
so much on your plate
at this moment.

06:44.292 --> 06:47.523
Your cousin's arrival,
the wedding, her party...

06:47.595 --> 06:50.996
I'll manage.
You've come for my help,
and you shall have it.

06:51.399 --> 06:53.424
Okay, Agatha! I'm ready

06:53.568 --> 06:54.762
Oh!

06:55.236 --> 06:57.101
What was the address
of that mobile home?

06:59.140 --> 07:01.040
You hired Magnum

07:02.777 --> 07:05.712
while I was steeping the tea?

07:05.780 --> 07:08.715
Jonathan,
please don't be upset.

07:08.783 --> 07:12.810
And I'm just to stand by
and watch you make another
questionable investment?

07:12.887 --> 07:14.445
Oh, dear.

07:14.522 --> 07:17.116
We didn't discuss that part.

07:17.825 --> 07:20.726
What's your usual fee,
Mr. Magnum?

07:20.795 --> 07:22.763
A round-trip ticket
to Florida.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.468
<i>It's not only a chance</i>
<i>at a dream vacation,</i>

07:28.536 --> 07:31.562
you actually become
one of the owners
of a luxury condo.

07:31.639 --> 07:34.233
Go on, pick a gift
just for coming by.

07:34.509 --> 07:35.703
Really?

07:36.944 --> 07:41.313
Tell me, how much
would you normally spend,
say, on a two-week vacation?

07:41.382 --> 07:45.785
Oh, about $1,000.
Does this popcorn popper
really work on batteries?

07:45.853 --> 07:47.514
Yeah, isn't that something?

07:48.389 --> 07:51.153
You know, you give me
half of that thousand
as a down,

07:51.225 --> 07:55.355
you've got
your own vacation resort,
one week a year for life.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.060
Well, fine.
I'll take 20 of them.

07:58.132 --> 08:01.465
If you can tell me
where to find what's left
of Eden Valley Investments.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.504
They got my last $10,000.

08:03.571 --> 08:06.540
How many investors
could one fly-by-night
operation have?

08:07.275 --> 08:11.211
Look, we never heard
of that outfit before
we rented this place, okay?

08:11.279 --> 08:12.837
Who do you rent from?

08:12.914 --> 08:16.543
I'm sure
they could tell for sure
if Eden Valley went bankrupt.

08:16.617 --> 08:20.109
Good question.
We're on our third
landlord this month.

08:22.356 --> 08:24.449
<i>Magnum, what's that</i>
<i>terrible noise?</i>

08:24.525 --> 08:26.254
<i>Is something wrong</i>
<i>with the Ferrari?</i>

08:26.327 --> 08:28.295
No! I need
to speak to Agatha.

08:28.362 --> 08:30.193
<i>We're late</i>
<i>leaving for the airport</i>
<i>to collect Sally.</i>

08:30.264 --> 08:31.458
Is it urgent?

08:31.532 --> 08:33.796
Well, just tell her
the whole thing smells
of a con.

08:33.868 --> 08:37.133
Eden Valley Investments
was owned by a company
called Future Times, Inc.

08:37.203 --> 08:38.831
Which also happened
to go bankrupt.

08:38.905 --> 08:41.500
And Future Times
was a subsidiary
of another company

08:41.576 --> 08:45.034
which happened to go bank...
Just a minute, Higgins.

08:45.112 --> 08:47.945
Boy, that sucker
really works! Now, stop!

08:48.015 --> 08:49.482
Stop? Stop what?

08:49.550 --> 08:51.518
<i>No. It's not you, Higgins.</i>

08:51.586 --> 08:52.848
I just overfilled it.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.548
Anyway, I'm up to
this company called Tee-Mar.

08:55.623 --> 08:57.420
No bankruptcies yet, but...

08:57.491 --> 08:59.186
Come on, cut it out now!

08:59.260 --> 09:01.592
<i>No suspicious</i>
<i>activities at all.</i>

09:01.662 --> 09:03.892
No address, no phone numbers,
no...

09:03.965 --> 09:06.832
No off-switch!
How do you shut it off?

09:06.901 --> 09:08.459
By saying goodbye.

09:08.836 --> 09:10.804
No! Wait! Higgins!

09:10.871 --> 09:13.772
That man is slowly driving me
out of my mind.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.436
What did he have to say?

09:15.509 --> 09:17.909
Nothing. He kept muttering
some incoherent gibberish

09:17.979 --> 09:20.573
about having some gadget
that exposes
bankrupt companies,

09:20.648 --> 09:22.206
and apparently
he'd over programmed it.

09:22.283 --> 09:24.774
Where are my keys?
This is absurd!
I never misplace my keys.

09:24.852 --> 09:27.548
I'm never late,
and now on this,
of all occasions, I...

09:27.622 --> 09:28.850
Jonathan.

09:34.328 --> 09:38.196
And actually,
we've plenty of time
before the plane arrives.

09:38.366 --> 09:41.392
Jonathan, you really
must relax.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.634
Yes, forgive me, I...

09:47.141 --> 09:51.874
Agatha,
Sally Ponting's stay here
means a great deal to me.

09:52.146 --> 09:53.841
Although I've not met
this young lady,

09:53.914 --> 09:56.974
I greatly admired
the Ponting family, as a boy.

09:57.051 --> 10:00.987
Their elegance,
their social poise,
gentility...

10:01.055 --> 10:02.989
They were
an inspiration to me.

10:03.691 --> 10:05.454
And now that a Ponting
is coming to visit,

10:05.526 --> 10:07.790
it's imperative
that everything be perfect.

10:08.596 --> 10:10.223
Do you understand?

10:19.340 --> 10:20.364
Yes?

10:20.441 --> 10:22.671
<i>Hey, brah! Got a fare out here</i>
<i>for this address.</i>

10:22.743 --> 10:24.176
<i>Miss Ponting.</i>

10:26.414 --> 10:28.507
We're off
to a flying start,
aren't we?

10:28.582 --> 10:31.449
Now, Jonathan,
her plane was probably early.

10:31.519 --> 10:33.350
Planes are never early.

10:44.832 --> 10:47.528
Here. You're Cousin Higgins.

10:47.601 --> 10:50.092
I took me a cheaper flight.

10:50.171 --> 10:55.165
Oh, pull me a beer, love,
let me sit on me tush
before I bloody drop.

11:01.348 --> 11:02.747
Oh, my God.

11:05.252 --> 11:06.549
I think you've got me
mixed up

11:06.620 --> 11:09.180
with them posh Pontings
in Kent, Higgins.

11:09.256 --> 11:10.985
Yes, well...

11:11.058 --> 11:13.026
I was not aware that
there were two

11:13.094 --> 11:15.494
separate and distinct
Ponting branches.

11:15.563 --> 11:17.326
Yeah! Separate is right!

11:17.565 --> 11:20.329
We've got nothing
to do with them
stuck-up cousins.

11:20.401 --> 11:23.928
That snooty Rory Ponting
insulted me dad once.

11:24.004 --> 11:25.266
He says,

11:25.339 --> 11:29.332
"Wally, why don't you come
down here to Kent,
and be my gardener?"

11:29.410 --> 11:31.776
Well, you know
what me dad did?

11:31.846 --> 11:35.782
He picks up this funny-Iooking
Chinese pitcher of Rory's...

11:36.350 --> 11:38.545
Oh, rather like this one.

11:38.619 --> 11:40.780
And he aims it right
at Rory's...

11:40.855 --> 11:43.255
Please! Don't throw that.

11:43.591 --> 11:45.252
It's priceless.

11:45.326 --> 11:48.784
That's what Rory said!
How did you know?

11:51.232 --> 11:56.363
Sally, wouldn't you like
to sit and have some tea?

11:56.504 --> 11:59.598
Don't bother, Higgins,
I'll make meself useful.

12:00.374 --> 12:02.205
Milk and sugar?

12:19.960 --> 12:23.396
Is that a popular hairstyle?

12:23.464 --> 12:24.931
You like it?

12:25.299 --> 12:27.859
I'm not sure. I think
I like lavender better,

12:27.935 --> 12:31.462
but, yeah, orange and black
is definitely in.

12:31.539 --> 12:35.270
Sally, I'm intrigued

12:35.342 --> 12:37.902
to know the details
of your meeting and courtship

12:37.978 --> 12:39.775
with Mr. Timothy Finch.

12:40.114 --> 12:41.979
Timmy? Isn't he a love?

12:42.950 --> 12:45.612
He was a regular
in a pub where I pull.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.651
I beg your pardon.
Where you what?

12:47.721 --> 12:52.249
Pull, Higgins. You know,
pull the drafts? Work.

12:52.726 --> 12:54.250
The Golden Guinea.

12:54.328 --> 12:57.263
He'd been, like, flirting
with me for months.

12:57.331 --> 13:00.789
And one night he drank
his weight in bitters,

13:00.868 --> 13:04.304
and he flat out
asked me if I was free
after closing time.

13:04.672 --> 13:08.039
Well, him and me
really hit it off.

13:08.108 --> 13:09.871
So, I took him
home to breakfast,

13:09.944 --> 13:11.502
and he asked
for me hand in marriage

13:11.579 --> 13:14.207
right there at the table
over me mum's kippers.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.755
I presume you know

13:22.823 --> 13:26.623
your fiancé
has been called back
to his London office.

13:26.694 --> 13:30.357
Well, of course I know.
Timmy calls me every day.

13:31.599 --> 13:35.330
You know, with his money,
he could have
picked some posh bird.

13:35.402 --> 13:38.894
But he wanted a nice,
simple, down-to-earth lass
like meself.

13:42.443 --> 13:43.637
Yes.

13:44.311 --> 13:46.939
But, I'm afraid, Sally,

13:47.348 --> 13:51.250
that to Mr. Finch's family,
to his friends,

13:53.320 --> 13:57.848
his mother, you may come
as something of a surprise.

13:57.925 --> 14:00.257
He didn't discuss this
with you?

14:01.328 --> 14:02.522
Discuss what with me?

14:02.596 --> 14:05.156
Sally, the Finches are...

14:05.933 --> 14:09.596
Well, they follow
the more established codes,

14:09.670 --> 14:13.265
as regards social behavior
and appearance.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.671
Yes.

14:14.742 --> 14:18.644
Your attire,
while it may be all the rage
with your peer group,

14:18.712 --> 14:21.272
would be most offensive
to Mrs. Finch.

14:22.249 --> 14:24.843
Well, I guess she'll have to
get used to me,

14:24.919 --> 14:27.888
'cause I just told you,
Timmy likes me like I am.

14:27.955 --> 14:32.221
And we've just told you
that his social group will not
accept you as you are.

14:32.893 --> 14:35.384
Is that what you want?
To have the marriage
canceled

14:35.462 --> 14:38.522
and to find yourself
returning to London
in disgrace?

14:39.400 --> 14:42.301
And what would I have to do
to make them like me?

14:42.636 --> 14:44.695
A bleeding
posh put-on, I suppose.

14:45.239 --> 14:46.763
Well, I won't do it!

14:47.341 --> 14:52.608
We're merely suggesting
a few minor modifications
in your presentation.

14:53.547 --> 14:56.448
Sally, whether you like it
or not, you're marrying
into high society,

14:56.517 --> 14:58.712
and you must abide
by their rules.

15:02.156 --> 15:05.125
Timmy should've told me
what I was getting into.

15:07.094 --> 15:11.428
I don't want his friends
laughing at him or me.

15:12.499 --> 15:17.266
They will, Sally.
I'm sorry, but they simply
won't understand.

15:19.707 --> 15:24.110
You know what to do then,
Higgins? To fix me?

15:25.646 --> 15:28.740
With Agatha's assistance
in your tutoring,

15:28.816 --> 15:31.785
and no distractions here
to dissipate our efforts,

15:31.852 --> 15:35.413
yes, I feel confident
that we can...

15:35.489 --> 15:36.888
Higgins.

15:37.057 --> 15:39.025
Mr. Magnum!

15:40.294 --> 15:42.728
Hi, guys. Popcorn?

15:43.097 --> 15:44.689
I don't mind if I do.

15:45.366 --> 15:48.301
Here now, you're a bit
of all right, ain't you?

15:49.303 --> 15:50.497
Sally?

15:50.571 --> 15:54.837
What? I mean...
I think you're charming.

15:55.275 --> 15:56.401
I think...

15:56.477 --> 15:57.705
Sally.

15:57.778 --> 15:59.507
I thought we had
an understanding.

15:59.580 --> 16:03.744
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I being
abrasive to Cousin Sally?

16:03.817 --> 16:06.843
I was speaking of your vow
to refrain from visiting
the main house.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.720
Oh, fine. I just have to talk
to Agatha for a minute.

16:11.959 --> 16:13.392
It's about
an extra plane ticket.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.452
See, Rick's doing some
work for me...
Here, you a mate of Higgins?

16:18.132 --> 16:19.895
In a manner of speaking.
Thomas Magnum.

16:19.967 --> 16:22.162
Oh, charmed.

16:22.236 --> 16:24.830
Higgins has really been
looking forward to your visit.

16:24.905 --> 16:27.237
Yeah, to have
a bleeding pet project.

16:28.108 --> 16:31.942
He wants to work me over
so I'm presentable
to Timmy's posh bunch.

16:32.579 --> 16:34.672
You think I should
let him do it?

16:39.553 --> 16:42.147
I shouldn't get involved.

16:42.823 --> 16:45.018
But I can't tell you
all he's done for me.

16:49.363 --> 16:53.026
Well, there's
a slight improvement,
but it's hardly sufficient.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.265
What on earth can be done
about her hair?

16:59.006 --> 17:01.998
I suppose you think I can
wash me fashion color out.

17:02.076 --> 17:03.703
Well, I can't, so there!

17:03.777 --> 17:07.144
Sally, you're forgetting
our extensive discussion
about your "I's."

17:07.214 --> 17:10.615
No, I'm not.
I took all me shadow off,
and I feel naked!

17:10.684 --> 17:13.618
I'm talking about
the sound, "I," remember?

17:13.987 --> 17:16.887
Take your "ah," add "E,"
and make them one.

17:16.957 --> 17:19.255
Ah-e, ah-e, ah-e, ah-e,

17:19.326 --> 17:21.317
I, I, I, I, I.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.790
Ah-e.

17:23.864 --> 17:25.194
Ah-e.

17:25.265 --> 17:27.256
Ah-e. Ah-e.
Ah-e. Ah-e.

17:27.334 --> 17:29.564
Ah-e. Ah-e.
Ah-e. Ah-e.

17:29.636 --> 17:32.799
Ah-e, ah-e, ah-e, ah-e,
Ah-e, ah-e, ah-e, ah-e,

17:33.040 --> 17:35.634
I, I, I, I, I...
I, I, I, I, I, I, I...

17:35.709 --> 17:38.610
Stop! You and I have
a communication problem.

17:38.679 --> 17:40.203
You know that?

17:41.748 --> 17:44.273
You and I have
a communication problem.

17:44.351 --> 17:47.809
Yes, Jonathan, she already
made that point.

17:47.888 --> 17:50.448
But she made it properly.
Sally, say it again.

17:50.524 --> 17:51.991
"You and I have..."

17:52.059 --> 17:54.084
Have what?
"A communication problem."

17:54.161 --> 17:56.595
I know that. Who's arguing?
No, just say it.

17:56.663 --> 17:58.654
I know that. Who's arguing?

17:58.732 --> 17:59.926
You did it again!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.524
You told me to!

18:01.869 --> 18:03.962
"You and I have."

18:04.204 --> 18:07.935
"You and I have."
You used a proper "I,"
you used an "H."

18:08.442 --> 18:09.932
Here, do it with me.

18:10.744 --> 18:14.680
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:16.517 --> 18:19.850
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:20.254 --> 18:22.222
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:22.289 --> 18:23.688
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:23.757 --> 18:24.815
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:24.892 --> 18:25.881
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:25.959 --> 18:27.017
You and I have.
You and I have.

18:27.094 --> 18:29.221
You and I have.
You have I have. You...

18:29.296 --> 18:31.457
I can't do it! I can't!

18:31.798 --> 18:34.062
I can't keep me "H" up.

18:42.342 --> 18:46.108
I can't be
bloody Rory Ponting,
not even put-on, like.

18:48.115 --> 18:51.141
When Timmy calls,
I'm telling him
the wedding's off,

18:51.218 --> 18:53.482
and then I'm going
home tonight!

18:53.554 --> 18:58.617
I'm sorry. I got carried away
with your progress.

18:59.193 --> 19:01.354
And there has been
progress, Sally.

19:01.828 --> 19:05.491
We should keep on working.
You needn't lose Mr. Finch.

19:05.566 --> 19:07.557
The party isn't
until tomorrow afternoon.

19:07.634 --> 19:10.467
We can stay up
all night and work.

19:12.005 --> 19:14.530
Unless, of course,
you'd rather go home

19:14.608 --> 19:18.271
and retreat
to the polite society
of the Golden Guinea.

19:20.847 --> 19:22.906
<i>Hey, I just want proof</i>
<i>that I'm going!</i>

19:22.983 --> 19:25.884
Okay, fine. You call Agatha
and ask her yourself.

19:25.953 --> 19:28.387
She's covering
your ticket to Florida
if we break the case.

19:28.455 --> 19:29.979
If we break the...

19:30.057 --> 19:33.026
Thomas, you told me
that all I had to do to get
to Disney World

19:33.093 --> 19:34.856
was find this place!

19:34.928 --> 19:37.624
Any idea
why Tee-Mar doesn't seem
to wanna be found?

19:37.698 --> 19:40.394
All I know is that
those people buy
hot typewriters.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.264
And all
the hot typewriter lady
knows is that

19:42.336 --> 19:44.998
nobody is around here
to pay the bill.

19:45.072 --> 19:48.371
"Mrs. Perroni's for
a thick slice of life?"

19:48.442 --> 19:50.569
You won fourth place for that?

19:50.644 --> 19:53.272
Can you believe they found
three better slogans?

19:55.315 --> 19:56.646
Okay.

19:57.884 --> 20:01.479
You stay here and yell
if you see anybody coming.

20:41.662 --> 20:43.755
You shouldn't have
snooped around so much.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.798
Ten grand's not worth it.

21:41.822 --> 21:45.258
<i>Lesson one</i>
<i>in planning a good</i>
<i>get-up-early day.</i>

21:45.325 --> 21:47.020
<i>You're going to be</i>
<i>very sleepy by noon,</i>

21:47.094 --> 21:49.619
<i>so limit</i>
<i>exciting surprises to two.</i>

21:49.696 --> 21:51.857
<i>Today, of course,</i>
<i>had had far too many.</i>

21:51.932 --> 21:54.560
<i>My good surprise,</i>
<i>Agatha's bad surprise,</i>

21:54.634 --> 21:57.797
<i>Higgins' prize cousin</i>
<i>with the surprisingly</i>
<i>orange hair.</i>

21:57.871 --> 22:01.034
<i>And my not-so-surprising hunch</i>
<i>that the missing 10,000</i>

22:01.108 --> 22:03.406
<i>was a tiny part</i>
<i>of a gigantic swindle.</i>

22:03.477 --> 22:05.035
<i>Take a few hundred</i>
<i>small investments,</i>

22:05.112 --> 22:06.875
<i>float them in a sea</i>
<i>of endless corporations,</i>

22:06.947 --> 22:11.350
<i>and somebody</i>
<i>finally ends up with several</i>
<i>nicely washed millions.</i>

22:11.418 --> 22:15.684
<i>Friendly Frank Ohmar</i>
<i>had just become somebody.</i>

22:15.756 --> 22:19.852
<i>I had a few questions</i>
<i>for him about the "F.O."</i>
<i>Initials on that note,</i>

22:19.926 --> 22:22.258
<i>about the proper use</i>
<i>of my corn-popper,</i>

22:22.329 --> 22:26.425
<i>and about why I was set up</i>
<i>with a surprise visitor</i>
<i>at Tee-Mar.</i>

22:28.068 --> 22:29.330
<i>Surprise!</i>

22:29.603 --> 22:33.198
What do you think
of our young lady
now, Jonathan?

22:33.273 --> 22:35.400
Yes, well, you've
certainly worked wonders
since yesterday,

22:35.475 --> 22:37.170
but her hair
still isn't right.

22:37.244 --> 22:39.906
Here! We've rubbed our hands
raw getting me fashion out.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.641
What in bloody hell
you want?

22:43.717 --> 22:45.150
That is to say,

22:45.218 --> 22:50.713
it was a painful
and tedious process
removing my orange aura.

22:52.359 --> 22:56.352
We had so hoped
that you'd be pleased.

22:56.430 --> 22:58.091
As a last resort,

22:58.165 --> 23:02.397
Mr. Rickie is upstairs
with a most attractive
brown wig.

23:03.870 --> 23:05.565
Well, let's try that.

23:05.639 --> 23:08.972
And, Jonathan,
Sally really must
get dressed.

23:09.042 --> 23:11.408
Yes, Agatha, I know.
We'll only be a moment.

23:13.046 --> 23:15.514
Now then, Sally,
one more time, please.

23:25.225 --> 23:30.390
I'm very pleased
to meet you, Mrs. Finch.

23:30.464 --> 23:31.897
Timmy...

23:32.299 --> 23:34.130
Timothy has...

23:34.501 --> 23:38.904
Has told me
so much about you.

23:39.573 --> 23:43.304
MRS. FINCH:
Yes, well, I'm finally glad
to meet you, Miss Ponting.

23:43.376 --> 23:47.335
Timothy has told me nothing
of my future daughter-in-law.

23:47.647 --> 23:49.808
Where do you reside
in England, dear?

23:52.285 --> 23:53.616
Kent.

23:54.488 --> 23:57.753
My father, Rory,
has a country estate

23:57.824 --> 24:01.157
with priceless Chinese vases.

24:03.964 --> 24:07.866
Really? I was born
and reared in Kent.

24:08.134 --> 24:13.538
Fifteen years in the Islands
may have dulled my ear
to regional dialects,

24:13.673 --> 24:18.110
but I have never heard
any accent quite like yours.

24:18.778 --> 24:20.109
Now, now, Sally,

24:20.180 --> 24:23.479
you should
never be embarrassed
by the Boxley Brogue.

24:23.550 --> 24:24.710
The Boxley...

24:24.784 --> 24:26.513
Boxley Girls'
Finishing School.

24:26.586 --> 24:30.579
The elocution teacher there
is renowned but unorthodox.

24:30.991 --> 24:34.449
Were any of the Royal Family
attending Boxley
while you were there, Sally?

24:35.695 --> 24:39.096
No, I just missed them.

24:39.533 --> 24:42.263
Dear old Boxley.

24:45.038 --> 24:48.530
Surely you remember it,
Mrs. Finch.

24:49.376 --> 24:52.174
Oh... Why, yes.

24:52.245 --> 24:54.543
Yes, of course.

24:54.614 --> 24:56.707
Another champagne,
Miss Ponting?

24:57.083 --> 24:58.607
Thank you.

25:00.220 --> 25:01.482
Well,

25:01.821 --> 25:05.279
I'm sure you ladies
would like to discuss
wedding plans.

25:05.358 --> 25:07.383
I'll see to the other guests

25:16.236 --> 25:18.704
Can you imagine
the confusion?

25:18.772 --> 25:22.003
My father and the lead hound
on the hunt

25:22.075 --> 25:24.202
both being named Rory?

25:28.014 --> 25:30.608
Isn't Sally charming,
Mrs. Finch?

25:30.917 --> 25:32.817
Oh, my, yes.

25:33.653 --> 25:37.589
But then I've never met
a Boxley Girl who wasn't.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.852
Oh, you're a lovely
young lady, Sally.

25:42.195 --> 25:45.687
I believe we're going to be
very close friends.

25:46.766 --> 25:48.233
One more, Miss Ponting?

25:48.668 --> 25:49.999
Thank you.

25:52.072 --> 25:55.041
My, what beautiful hair
you have.

25:55.108 --> 25:56.473
Thank you.

25:56.776 --> 25:58.835
But it isn't mine.

25:58.912 --> 26:01.608
Mine's the sweaty mess
underneath

26:05.852 --> 26:09.413
My poor mother had to wear
a wig for months once

26:09.489 --> 26:11.150
while her hair grew out.

26:11.224 --> 26:13.692
You see, in her younger days,

26:13.760 --> 26:16.228
the beehive hairdo
was all the rage.

26:16.296 --> 26:18.127
Well, mum's cost her
a week's pay,

26:18.198 --> 26:20.928
so she didn't wanna
give it up.
Babied it forever.

26:21.001 --> 26:25.700
Well, would you believe
that real bees took up a nest
in it before mum knew it?

26:25.772 --> 26:28.104
They had to shave her bald
to get them out.

26:35.048 --> 26:38.984
Warm wine's all right
but not on a hot day.

26:40.553 --> 26:44.512
I know, Mrs. Finch.
What we need is a cooling
Midnight Blitz!

26:46.259 --> 26:47.851
Jonathan!

26:49.429 --> 26:50.453
Jonathan!

26:50.530 --> 26:52.521
It was an unusually cool day
for southern India,

26:52.599 --> 26:54.191
and our battalion had
just encountered...

26:54.267 --> 26:56.701
Jonathan! May I speak
with you, please?

26:56.770 --> 26:59.000
Yes, Agatha, in a moment.
Our battalion...

26:59.072 --> 27:02.508
Jonathan, now!
Get your lungs ready.
One, two, three, four.

27:02.575 --> 27:05.203
<i>Anytime you're Lambeth way</i>

27:05.278 --> 27:07.644
<i>Any evening, any day</i>

27:07.714 --> 27:10.205
<i>You'll find yourself</i>

27:10.283 --> 27:12.774
<i>Doing the Lambeth walk. Oye!</i>

27:12.852 --> 27:15.184
<i>Everything's free and easy</i>

27:15.255 --> 27:17.587
<i>Do as you darn well pleasey</i>

27:17.657 --> 27:19.784
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>make your way there?</i>

27:19.859 --> 27:22.259
<i>Go there, stay there</i>

27:22.328 --> 27:24.592
<i>Anytime you're Lambeth way</i>

27:24.664 --> 27:27.132
<i>Any evening, any day</i>

27:27.200 --> 27:29.464
<i>You'll find yourself</i>

27:29.536 --> 27:32.198
<i>Doing the Lambeth walk. Oye!</i>

27:32.272 --> 27:33.637
All right, then!

27:33.707 --> 27:36.141
Midnight Blitzes
over here.

27:36.209 --> 27:40.270
And you teetotalers
can tote your tea over here.

27:44.617 --> 27:47.711
Here, Higgins, we did
all that work for nothing.

27:47.787 --> 27:50.517
These people like me
just the way I am.

27:59.815 --> 28:02.045
I have a call in
to Timothy, in London.

28:02.117 --> 28:04.347
I'm officially
canceling the wedding.

28:04.553 --> 28:07.386
Without Timothy and Sally
having any say in the matter?

28:07.456 --> 28:11.688
My son can be
very impulsive, particularly
when he's drinking.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.093
I'm sure when he hears
of this afternoon's fiasco,

28:15.163 --> 28:18.223
he'll agree with my decision.
Good night.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.927
Mrs. Finch,

28:20.002 --> 28:22.630
what you saw before Sally's
unfortunate relapse

28:22.704 --> 28:25.104
was the result of only
two days' work.

28:25.173 --> 28:29.200
With her desire and quickness,
these last three days could
bring miracles.

28:29.278 --> 28:31.746
This is not the Olympics,
Mr. Higgins.

28:31.813 --> 28:33.075
It's my son's marriage.

28:33.148 --> 28:36.515
Precisely. A marriage
both he and Sally want.

28:36.585 --> 28:39.418
It does seem
worth an effort before facing
the embarrassment

28:39.488 --> 28:42.651
of canceling the wedding
or an elopement.

28:43.425 --> 28:48.954
Very well, I shall meet
with Miss Ponting
a day before the wedding.

28:50.265 --> 28:53.132
At that time,
for all appearances,

28:53.902 --> 28:57.338
I expect to meet
a true Boxley girl!

29:08.216 --> 29:11.083
I must confess
to eavesdropping, Jonathan.

29:13.722 --> 29:17.317
One more disgrace
at this point seems minimal.

29:18.627 --> 29:20.492
I thought you'd gone home.

29:20.562 --> 29:24.521
I've been up with Sally.
She's very upset.

29:24.833 --> 29:28.200
Yes, well, of course
it's impossible

29:28.270 --> 29:30.704
to get her ready
in two days' time,

29:30.772 --> 29:35.004
but I must try,
even in the light of today's
poor judgment.

29:35.644 --> 29:39.978
I feel just as hopeless
about Mr. Magnum
finding the money.

29:40.816 --> 29:43.216
But we can't give up.

29:44.252 --> 29:45.583
No.

29:45.821 --> 29:48.255
Not if we're ever to look
Island society

29:48.323 --> 29:50.689
or family members
in the face again.

29:52.394 --> 29:53.691
Tomorrow morning, then?

29:55.597 --> 29:59.294
<i>Mrs. Finch, I can only</i>
<i>beg your forgiveness</i>

29:59.368 --> 30:02.531
for my outrageous conduct
of last Saturday.

30:02.604 --> 30:05.072
And as your son
is quite dear to me,

30:05.140 --> 30:07.335
I humbly request
that the wedding

30:07.409 --> 30:09.969
be allowed to take place
on schedule.

30:15.083 --> 30:16.846
Bloody hell!

30:17.919 --> 30:19.147
It's you.

30:19.621 --> 30:24.320
That is not Sally talking,
it's Jonathan Higgins
or Henry Higgins.

30:24.393 --> 30:25.553
I beg your pardon.

30:25.627 --> 30:29.256
You're doing to Sally
exactly what Rex Harrison
did to Audrey Hepburn.

30:29.331 --> 30:30.764
<i>My Fair Lady.</i>

30:30.832 --> 30:32.322
You're using her
as a guinea pig

30:32.401 --> 30:34.096
for your own
self-indulgent experiment.

30:34.169 --> 30:36.364
If there were
a comparison to be made,

30:36.638 --> 30:40.199
it would be
what Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree
did to Mrs. Patrick Campbell

30:40.275 --> 30:44.041
in a G.B. Shaw classic
entitled, <i>Pygmalion.</i>
But there is none.

30:44.513 --> 30:47.880
I am simply trying
to help Sally have
what she desires,

30:47.949 --> 30:49.416
Mr. Timothy Finch.

30:49.918 --> 30:51.146
Are you?

30:52.087 --> 30:53.748
Magnum, why are you here?

30:53.822 --> 30:55.312
I have to talk to Agatha.

30:55.390 --> 30:57.221
Look, Sally,

30:57.492 --> 31:00.586
you just relax
and be yourself, okay?

31:00.829 --> 31:03.024
If you talk to Mrs. Finch
in your own words...

31:03.098 --> 31:04.360
Why don't I tell
the old bag that

31:04.433 --> 31:08.529
I'm sick of the whole
confused, posh, snooty,
bloody lot of you.

31:14.409 --> 31:17.401
I'll ask you
for the last time
to stop interfering.

31:17.479 --> 31:19.709
Yes, Mr. Magnum, really.

31:19.781 --> 31:23.945
Wouldn't your time
be better spent looking
for the I.B.A.'s money?

31:24.019 --> 31:25.850
I have been looking.
I just got the run-around

31:25.921 --> 31:28.116
from my third quiet,
little investment firm.

31:28.190 --> 31:32.388
You interrupted my progress
with Sally to reiterate this
corporate scheme nonsense?

31:32.461 --> 31:34.622
Yes. I mean, come on,
it wasn't nonsense

31:34.696 --> 31:36.687
to the guy who tried
to have me killed.

31:37.432 --> 31:40.458
I just know
if I can get one more look
at the Tee-Mar files,

31:40.535 --> 31:42.901
I can prove that
half the small investors
on this Island

31:42.971 --> 31:45.132
are getting burned,
and I need help to do it.

31:47.576 --> 31:51.342
Now, Agatha, how far
do you want me to go
to find this money?

31:51.746 --> 31:53.077
Oh, dear.

31:53.348 --> 31:55.816
Do I have to go
to Florida again?

31:57.452 --> 31:59.443
A ticket for T.C.

31:59.688 --> 32:02.657
Higgins, I know
that there's something
in these files

32:02.724 --> 32:04.555
that'll show that
this last name on the memo,

32:04.626 --> 32:07.720
this Western Shelter outfit,
is the big umbrella company.

32:07.796 --> 32:10.162
Now, I'd check it out myself,
but the address is in

32:10.232 --> 32:11.756
San Diego.
- San Diego.

32:13.869 --> 32:18.602
Really, Magnum.
Western Shelter Corporation
is a very respectable firm.

32:18.673 --> 32:21.233
Mr. Masters has several
investments with them.

32:21.309 --> 32:22.640
Small investments?

32:22.711 --> 32:25.111
The kind that Robin wouldn't
worry about too much

32:25.180 --> 32:27.705
if it got lost
in a bankruptcy?

32:31.786 --> 32:34.687
Mr. Masters will pay
for one ticket to Florida.

32:34.956 --> 32:37.186
Now all of you
can meet David Duck.

32:39.628 --> 32:41.528
Coach excursion rate.

32:42.030 --> 32:43.497
T. C: <i>That wasn't the deal.</i>

32:43.565 --> 32:45.726
Come on,
at least you're on
the plane.

32:57.345 --> 32:59.939
What happened
to first-class airfare?

33:00.015 --> 33:01.846
What happened
to my expenses?

33:01.917 --> 33:03.475
And my hotel room?

33:03.552 --> 33:05.543
I couldn't push it, T.C.

33:05.620 --> 33:08.384
Besides, I'm not asking you
to do much for the ticket.

33:09.758 --> 33:11.089
Trivia question.

33:11.159 --> 33:13.992
What is the penalty
for impersonating
a government official?

33:14.062 --> 33:15.689
The prison terms vary.

33:15.764 --> 33:18.892
Look, T.C.,
there's hardly anyone in there
but one little secretary.

33:18.967 --> 33:20.559
We'll be in and out
in five minutes,

33:20.635 --> 33:23.798
and we'll be in Disney World
for five days, hmm?

33:30.545 --> 33:32.274
<i>Internal Revenue Service?</i>

33:32.347 --> 33:33.473
Right.

33:33.882 --> 33:35.406
Just a couple of questions.

33:35.483 --> 33:37.610
There seems to be
some confusion

33:37.686 --> 33:41.452
about your employer's
ID request form.

33:41.723 --> 33:44.920
Speaking of ID,
do you have any?

33:47.829 --> 33:51.094
I guess you haven't
dealt with people
from my office before.

33:51.166 --> 33:53.225
We don't carry ID.

33:53.568 --> 33:56.696
We dealt with the I.R.S.
Just the other day.

33:56.771 --> 34:00.229
That guy made an appointment.
He had ID.

34:05.413 --> 34:07.745
Okay, this is so embarrassing.

34:07.983 --> 34:09.507
T. C: My kid...

34:09.985 --> 34:13.079
She tore up my ID card
just this very morning.

34:13.154 --> 34:16.646
But you can call
and check me out.
I'm I.R.S.

34:16.725 --> 34:18.158
Yes, we will.

34:18.226 --> 34:21.922
We're only in today
because we were expecting
a guy in a red Ferrari

34:21.996 --> 34:23.157
to pay us a visit.

34:23.231 --> 34:25.426
Red Ferrari?
Yeah. You know him?

34:25.500 --> 34:26.762
No.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.400
I mean, I don't know
anyone that classy.

34:29.471 --> 34:33.668
Look, it's obvious
that I've caught you
at a bad time,

34:33.742 --> 34:35.505
so I'll be leaving.

34:36.578 --> 34:38.341
Hold it right there!

34:42.984 --> 34:44.849
Thomas? Tom?

34:50.492 --> 34:51.719
Let's go!

34:51.793 --> 34:53.920
See? What'd I tell you,
T. C? In and out in five.

34:53.995 --> 34:57.021
It is all here!
Computer printouts
for all the companies...

34:57.098 --> 34:59.623
Magnum.
...for Eden Valley investments
to Western Shelter,

34:59.701 --> 35:01.066
and 818 at the top!
Thomas!

35:01.136 --> 35:02.865
At first I thought
it was a typo, but it's not!

35:02.937 --> 35:04.302
It's the name of a company.

35:04.372 --> 35:05.999
The company!
Will you forget about that,

35:06.074 --> 35:08.269
and let's get
the hell out of here?
What's your hurry?

35:18.019 --> 35:20.852
<i>Sally,</i>
<i>we're going to be late.</i>

35:29.297 --> 35:32.960
You look stunning.
Congratulations.

35:34.803 --> 35:37.363
I was just about
to say the same.

35:37.906 --> 35:39.134
Yes.

35:40.475 --> 35:43.740
Let's hope
Timothy is as pleased
with your transformation

35:43.812 --> 35:45.439
as his mother was.

35:45.980 --> 35:48.312
He called last night
after he arrived.

35:48.917 --> 35:52.648
I'm afraid he still feels
the whole thing
was a bit unnecessary,

35:53.188 --> 35:55.213
but he's glad
that she's pleased.

35:55.290 --> 35:59.226
I'm sure he'll be quite proud
when he sees
his Boxley girl.

36:01.196 --> 36:05.929
Pity that I can never be quite
as posh as those Boxley ladies
Mrs. Finch knew in England.

36:06.501 --> 36:10.369
Sally, there is
no Boxley Finishing School.

36:16.778 --> 36:18.678
Oh, thank you, Higgins.

36:20.048 --> 36:21.447
Shall we go?

36:22.884 --> 36:26.320
Higgins, are you proud of me?

36:27.255 --> 36:28.415
Honestly?

36:29.657 --> 36:32.148
Very proud, indeed,
Cousin Sally.

36:32.894 --> 36:35.192
You're a tribute
to the Ponting name.

37:10.098 --> 37:11.258
Where is the groom?

37:11.332 --> 37:13.391
I don't know.
I'll have a look outside.

37:20.909 --> 37:22.206
Where's the groom?

37:23.912 --> 37:25.641
Oh, the groom isn't here?

37:35.757 --> 37:37.452
I don't understand...

38:04.834 --> 38:09.203
The best man
left Timothy talking on
the telephone in the vestry.

38:09.639 --> 38:13.575
He apparently received
this urgent phone call
just before the service,

38:14.110 --> 38:17.876
and when the best man asked
if the processional
should start, he said yes,

38:17.947 --> 38:19.915
that he'd only be a moment.

38:21.150 --> 38:22.947
That's the last
anyone saw of him.

38:23.019 --> 38:26.546
Mr. Finch
has to be in some kind
of terrible trouble.

38:26.823 --> 38:28.654
There's no other explanation.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.124
No.

38:30.893 --> 38:34.192
Magnum, if you would consider
for Sally's sake

38:35.198 --> 38:39.601
investigating Timothy's
disappearance,
I would be most grateful.

38:41.504 --> 38:42.630
Well, I...

38:42.705 --> 38:45.299
Well, I didn't even get
a chance to tell you,

38:45.375 --> 38:47.866
I think I finally have
something on Agatha's case.

38:48.444 --> 38:53.143
Please, Mr. Magnum.
We can't allow that to be
of first priority now.

38:55.351 --> 38:56.875
Do you have Finch's address?

38:56.953 --> 39:00.514
818 Honawi Terrace,
the ground floor apartment.

39:01.457 --> 39:03.857
Well, yeah.
I'll go take a look.

39:05.228 --> 39:06.490
Thank you, Magnum.

39:06.562 --> 39:07.824
Right.

39:17.173 --> 39:19.573
Jonathan, I'll gladly stay.

39:19.642 --> 39:23.078
I mean, Sally might need me
when she wakes.

39:23.313 --> 39:25.110
Sally's all right.

39:33.956 --> 39:35.583
It isn't fair.

39:36.659 --> 39:38.889
You've worked so hard.

39:40.396 --> 39:42.796
You're a good, kind sort,
you know that?

39:42.865 --> 39:45.060
I appreciate everything
you've done.

39:56.879 --> 39:59.848
I'm leaving in the morning,
Higgins, 10:00 plane.

40:00.183 --> 40:03.619
Sally, I really don't think
that's wise at this point.

40:04.887 --> 40:09.221
There may be some very simple
and logical explanation

40:09.292 --> 40:10.919
for Timothy's behavior.

40:10.993 --> 40:13.826
Has anyone considered
the possibility that Timmy

40:13.896 --> 40:16.922
simply and logically
changed his mind about me?

40:17.667 --> 40:20.465
If that had been the case,
he would have told you.

40:20.536 --> 40:23.528
Gentlemen don't leave ladies
standing at the altar.

40:23.606 --> 40:27.372
I told you, this gentleman had
all the posh ones he wanted.

40:28.244 --> 40:29.871
So what do we do?

40:29.946 --> 40:32.244
Fix him up
with another posh bird.

40:33.349 --> 40:35.340
Rory Ponting in a dress.

40:36.953 --> 40:38.318
You're right.

40:39.989 --> 40:43.288
I should never have
asked you to become,
in a matter of days,

40:43.793 --> 40:46.023
something you've spent
years loathing.

40:46.362 --> 40:49.160
You didn't ask, Higgins.
That's the point.

40:50.199 --> 40:51.666
Thomas was right.

40:52.135 --> 40:54.296
I saw that <i>Fair Lady</i> flick.

40:56.572 --> 41:00.099
We just both tried
to make me over
for all the wrong reasons.

41:00.176 --> 41:02.906
But we accomplished
a great deal.

41:03.546 --> 41:05.810
What does it matter...
It matters,

41:06.482 --> 41:08.211
'cause I don't loathe it.

41:09.385 --> 41:12.320
Yeah, I like
what I've learned.

41:13.456 --> 41:16.584
But now I've got no choice
but to go back
to the Golden Guinea

41:16.659 --> 41:19.184
and not be as satisfied
pulling the drafts.

41:20.463 --> 41:25.332
See, that Sally was happy
with her orange hair
and her fashion

41:25.401 --> 41:28.962
'cause that's who she was,
or said she was.

41:29.372 --> 41:30.361
Now,

41:31.107 --> 41:35.339
how am I supposed to say
who I am with half
of both worlds to pick from?

41:38.147 --> 41:41.014
I'm sorry if I confused you.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.644
I truly felt
that I was helping you
to reach your goal

41:45.388 --> 41:47.015
of marrying Mr. Finch.

41:47.089 --> 41:49.523
I didn't do it
for that, Higgins.

41:49.592 --> 41:52.584
It's not Timmy I'm missing.
It's me.

41:54.764 --> 41:58.131
Oh, I loved him,
but then I realized

41:58.734 --> 42:00.929
it was just his posh
I wanted.

42:02.638 --> 42:05.471
Look, you've helped me a lot,
all right?

42:05.541 --> 42:07.873
We just both forgot to ask,
that's all.

42:08.678 --> 42:11.306
You never asked if it was
all right to fix me,

42:12.215 --> 42:15.651
and I never asked meself
if it was really
what I wanted.

42:17.687 --> 42:19.120
I understand.

42:20.056 --> 42:22.547
But, Sally, please,

42:23.259 --> 42:25.955
you can't return
to that life in London.

42:26.028 --> 42:28.553
If you stay here,
we can continue...

42:28.631 --> 42:31.293
No. No. You don't understand.

42:31.968 --> 42:33.799
There is nothing to continue.

42:33.870 --> 42:35.030
Sally...

42:41.644 --> 42:43.475
Robin Masters' estate.

42:44.313 --> 42:45.712
I beg your pardon?

42:48.618 --> 42:50.085
It's Timothy.

43:01.097 --> 43:03.327
<i>I once read about</i>
<i>two long lost sisters</i>

43:03.399 --> 43:05.629
<i>who had spent 20 years</i>
<i>looking for each other.</i>

43:05.701 --> 43:08.966
<i>They both happened to be</i>
<i>in Tulsa, Oklahoma,</i>
<i>on the same weekend</i>

43:09.038 --> 43:12.064
<i>and collided into each other</i>
<i>at an intersection.</i>

43:12.141 --> 43:16.009
<i>I had just such a collision</i>
<i>at 818 Honawi.</i>

43:16.078 --> 43:18.740
<i>The improbable had become</i>
<i>a real problem,</i>

43:19.081 --> 43:21.140
<i>and I had to deal with it.</i>

43:32.128 --> 43:35.291
<i>I finally had the proof to</i>
<i>break the investment swindle.</i>

43:35.698 --> 43:38.997
<i>But I had to figure</i>
<i>that Sally had</i>
<i>a breaking point as well.</i>

43:39.468 --> 43:41.129
<i>Maybe even Higgins.</i>

43:41.203 --> 43:45.435
<i>And it was going to be</i>
<i>hard to hit them</i>
<i>with this last big surprise.</i>

43:45.975 --> 43:49.638
<i>The two sisters recovered</i>
<i>and lived happily ever after</i>
<i>in Tulsa,</i>

43:50.146 --> 43:53.343
<i>but I couldn't think of</i>
<i>a way for this one</i>
<i>to have a happy ending.</i>

43:57.153 --> 43:58.415
Higgins.

43:58.888 --> 44:00.287
Magnum?

44:00.489 --> 44:02.081
What are you all doing here?

44:02.158 --> 44:04.251
What are we doing here,
Higgins?

44:04.327 --> 44:07.387
Mr. Finch called.
He really does care
for Sally.

44:07.463 --> 44:10.921
I drove her here so that
he could explain
about the wedding.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.936
Did he also explain that
Frank here made
the phone call to the church

44:15.004 --> 44:17.063
and told him to go
into hiding in a hurry?

44:17.139 --> 44:18.538
How did you find us?

44:18.608 --> 44:21.873
Well, I finally remembered
you can't move these things
with a pickup truck.

44:22.078 --> 44:23.409
Frank.

44:23.479 --> 44:26.073
I don't understand.
You introduced yourself
as Leonard.

44:26.148 --> 44:28.708
Higgins, please,
this is Frank Ohmar.

44:28.784 --> 44:32.276
He and Finch are the big guys
in this insurance scam,
the 818 Company.

44:32.355 --> 44:35.449
A very quiet
international giant
run from Finch's apartment.

44:35.524 --> 44:37.992
I found all the proof
in his files.
- That's impossible.

44:38.060 --> 44:40.528
Timothy Finch is
one of the wealthiest men
in the island.

44:40.596 --> 44:43.759
And it takes a lot of
ingenuity to become
that rich, Mr. Higgins.

44:44.634 --> 44:47.569
Please, all of you,
move away from the door.

44:52.375 --> 44:54.434
I've explained everything
to Sally,

44:55.177 --> 44:56.872
and she's leaving with me.

45:03.352 --> 45:06.583
Sally, why?

45:07.857 --> 45:11.020
Like I told you, Higgins,
I loves Timmy,

45:11.761 --> 45:15.527
and I didn't go through
all your messing around
just to lose him now.

45:15.598 --> 45:18.158
Sorry to leave you
with this problem, Frank,

45:18.234 --> 45:20.031
but I'm sure that
you can handle it.

45:32.848 --> 45:34.213
Let's have it.

45:53.302 --> 45:55.463
He really could be a love

45:57.273 --> 45:59.104
when he was drinking.

46:04.113 --> 46:06.104
A glass of sherry, please.

46:06.182 --> 46:09.117
That posh stuff
will kill you, Higgins.

46:09.351 --> 46:10.648
Better have a draft.

46:12.421 --> 46:14.821
I'm very glad
you decided to stay.

46:14.890 --> 46:18.849
Yeah, well, like I said,
I need a bit of both worlds
right now.

46:18.928 --> 46:21.396
Working here keeps me
Golden Guinea half satisfied

46:21.464 --> 46:23.659
while the rest of me
finds out who I am.

46:24.567 --> 46:26.057
I don't know much
for sure yet,

46:26.135 --> 46:28.695
but it's a fact
I'll never be
quite what I was.

46:30.873 --> 46:32.101
Likewise.

46:34.944 --> 46:37.242
Hey, Sally, congratulations
on your new job.
Hey!

46:37.313 --> 46:38.610
Oh, hello, boys.

46:38.681 --> 46:40.774
We all came by
just to kick off
the new day.

46:40.850 --> 46:42.181
Well, have a drink on me.

46:42.251 --> 46:43.684
I'll have a coffee, here.
I'll have a brandy.

46:43.753 --> 46:45.118
A beer.
All right.

46:45.187 --> 46:47.519
We are also here
to celebrate the fact

46:47.590 --> 46:50.115
that Mrs. Perroni's
Florida Tour

46:50.192 --> 46:53.059
leaves in exactly
one month from today.

46:54.663 --> 46:57.564
Higgie baby,
you and Agatha can order
the plane tickets.

46:57.633 --> 46:59.225
Oh, that reminds me.

46:59.301 --> 47:01.792
This came in the morning mail
for you, Magnum.

47:01.871 --> 47:05.739
Hold your breath, T.C.
With that slogan of his,
it could be one big mistake.

47:11.113 --> 47:14.879
For your information,
I have been upgraded a spot.

47:14.950 --> 47:18.215
They found out
the third place slogan was
a direct quote from Dickens.

47:19.488 --> 47:21.285
All right!
Wait a minute.

47:21.657 --> 47:23.352
Is the prize better?

47:23.425 --> 47:25.017
A vacation for four!

47:25.094 --> 47:27.927
All expenses paid
including airfare!

47:29.598 --> 47:31.088
Four to Disney World!

47:31.167 --> 47:32.828
No. Waikiki.

47:32.902 --> 47:34.665
Waikiki?
Waikiki?

47:35.271 --> 47:38.798
Here now, that's right
close down the road here,
isn't it, love?
