WEBVTT

00:02.031 --> 00:03.859
- What is this?
- New menu.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.692
New menu?
No one asked us.

00:05.811 --> 00:07.968
You put raisins
in my Sunshine Salad?

00:08.053 --> 00:09.243
Where's my turkey burger?

00:09.328 --> 00:11.893
The chicken fingers
only come with three now?

00:12.727 --> 00:14.046
It doesn't even open.

00:14.131 --> 00:15.464
How can I
whisper about Marjorie

00:15.550 --> 00:17.104
if I have nothing
to hide behind?

00:17.366 --> 00:19.800
I knew
you weren't ready for this.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.329
Well, that was stressful.

00:24.110 --> 00:27.071
Hey, anybody want to come
with me to the bonsai exhibit

00:27.157 --> 00:28.594
at the Civic Center tomorrow?

00:28.788 --> 00:31.372
Sorry.
Tiny trees make me sad.

00:31.605 --> 00:33.521
That's why I don't eat broccoli.

00:34.372 --> 00:38.172
I can't.
I'm getting something done.

00:38.708 --> 00:41.209
- Bonnie?
- I wish I could, but I have plans.

00:41.294 --> 00:43.086
She's helping me study
for the GED.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.102
Oh, that's right, I
really do have plans.

00:45.708 --> 00:49.266
Unlike Miss Getting
Something Done.

00:50.161 --> 00:52.611
I didn't know you were
taking the GEDs. Good for you.

00:52.696 --> 00:55.300
Yeah, it's the first step towards
getting my contractor's license.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.456
The second step is
learning how not to show up

00:57.542 --> 00:59.183
when I say I will.

01:00.447 --> 01:01.894
It's so cute.
These two have had

01:01.980 --> 01:04.510
a lot of late-night study
sessions at my house.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.980
I make them celery
stuffed with peanut butter.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.214
We feed it
to the cats to shut them up.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.253
You ever hear a cat try to meow
with a mouth full of Skippy?

01:15.214 --> 01:16.495
Oh, here comes the smoker.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.003
Bonnie, come sit by me

01:18.089 --> 01:19.972
so she doesn't stink up
my cashmere.

01:21.018 --> 01:22.753
Would you like to look at
the new menu,

01:22.839 --> 01:24.295
or is it gonna freak you out?

01:24.380 --> 01:26.573
Oh, God,
there's a new menu?

01:30.478 --> 01:31.905
Sorry I'm late.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.845
There was a big accident
on the freeway.

01:33.931 --> 01:36.009
Oh, please.
You were smoking.

01:36.149 --> 01:37.610
Both could be true.

01:37.818 --> 01:39.818
They're not, but they could be.

01:40.282 --> 01:41.487
Well, I'm glad you're here.

01:41.572 --> 01:43.189
I brought something
for you.

01:43.274 --> 01:44.523
That's sweet.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.274
How come she gets a gift
and we don't?

01:46.360 --> 01:48.423
And by "we," I mean
"me."

01:50.915 --> 01:52.364
Oh.

01:53.493 --> 01:56.536
They're beautiful.

01:57.288 --> 02:00.172
Never mind. Whatever that is,
I don't want one.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.644
They're lungs.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.462
We use them at the
hospital to scare teenagers.

02:04.649 --> 02:06.512
Healthy lung,
smoker's lung.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.930
It only takes six months
to go from that to that.

02:10.116 --> 02:13.313
So what you're saying is
I don't have to quit till June.

02:33.571 --> 02:34.811
Come on, Tammy.

02:34.897 --> 02:36.364
The square of the hypotenuse

02:36.450 --> 02:38.712
of a right triangle is
equal to what?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.180
26.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.610
24.

02:44.547 --> 02:45.913
Eight.

02:46.156 --> 02:47.629
I'm not looking for a number.

02:47.808 --> 02:49.867
X. Lot of times it's X.

02:49.953 --> 02:52.251
I'm gonna jump in here.
It's the sum of the squares

02:52.337 --> 02:53.643
of the two adjacent sides.

02:53.729 --> 02:55.962
Which is probably 26.

02:56.657 --> 02:58.741
How come you know this stuff
so much better than I do?

02:58.826 --> 03:01.984
Because we've been going through
it relentlessly for six weeks.

03:02.070 --> 03:03.297
God, I'm never gonna pass.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.305
You'll be fine.
You were the "A" student

03:05.391 --> 03:06.430
when we were teenagers.

03:06.516 --> 03:09.016
That was many
brain cells ago.

03:09.299 --> 03:11.083
You know, before the drinking,
the drugs

03:11.169 --> 03:14.071
and my Roller Derby concussions.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:16.907 --> 03:20.649
Hey. Tammy, I specifically
put the lungs away

03:20.735 --> 03:22.091
so I wouldn't have to see that.

03:22.177 --> 03:24.673
Wendy told me to keep
it in your face. Catch.

03:24.759 --> 03:27.317
Hey.
How many times have I told you kids

03:27.403 --> 03:29.368
to not play lung in the house?

03:30.015 --> 03:31.704
Wendy is driving me crazy.

03:31.790 --> 03:34.640
She keeps sending me pictures
of smokers with mouth cancer

03:34.726 --> 03:36.157
and holes in their throats.

03:36.243 --> 03:39.227
Gross.
Can you forward me one?

03:40.426 --> 03:43.368
It can be your treat when
we complete your math review.

03:43.454 --> 03:46.391
The carrot on the stick.
Well played.

03:47.184 --> 03:49.155
Why is my Visa bill so high?

03:49.241 --> 03:51.196
Don't look at me.
I haven't used your Visa card

03:51.282 --> 03:53.366
since Starbucks started
asking for I.D.

03:53.511 --> 03:56.970
I mean, even in a hat,
they won't believe I'm you.

03:57.613 --> 04:01.048
I spent over $200 on
cigarettes last month?

04:02.153 --> 04:04.402
That's it.
I'm quitting.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.495
Wait a minute, so pictures of
cancer mouth didn't get to you,

04:07.581 --> 04:08.964
but the Visa bill did?

04:09.050 --> 04:10.509
We're all gonna die of something.

04:10.595 --> 04:12.477
Until then, I need money.

04:13.509 --> 04:15.478
I can't believe you
just threw out those cigarettes.

04:15.563 --> 04:18.954
You know, in prison, that's two
massages and a cornbread muffin.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.744
I am so proud of you.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.751
I hate that nasty habit.

04:23.837 --> 04:25.358
Awfully judgy for a woman

04:25.444 --> 04:28.821
who used to snort coke
with a tampon applicator.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.251
Even high, I was an innovator.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.587
This is gonna be good.

04:34.673 --> 04:38.032
This is the right decision.
I just saved my own life.

04:38.169 --> 04:39.668
What have you done today?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.642
Oh, Bonnie's been helping
me study for the GED.

04:42.728 --> 04:44.190
She knows this stuff
better than I do.

04:44.275 --> 04:45.450
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.941
Hey, Bonnie. You know what?

04:47.027 --> 04:48.595
You should take
the GED with me.

04:48.681 --> 04:50.082
Why the hell would I do that?

04:50.226 --> 04:51.706
Well, you could get
a high school diploma.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.008
Don't you want one? Come on,
Christy, what do you think?

04:54.463 --> 04:56.384
Should I have had
one final cigarette

04:56.470 --> 04:58.127
before I threw them all away?

04:58.488 --> 05:01.150
You know, if I wanted a diploma,
I could just print one out

05:01.274 --> 05:03.807
on my computer like I did
with my pilot's license.

05:04.861 --> 05:06.330
- Hey.
- Adam's home.

05:06.416 --> 05:08.197
- Calm down.
- What's going on?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.642
I quit smoking.
And it's a nightmare.

05:12.488 --> 05:14.897
I'm trying to convince Bonnie
to take the GED with me.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.385
- That sounds like a great idea...
- Now, don't you start.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.534
- Why?
- You always say you hate

05:18.620 --> 05:20.944
being a building manager.
Maybe this will open up some doors.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.230
Oh, I see,
you're ashamed of me.

05:23.695 --> 05:25.681
Sorry, I'm out.

05:27.345 --> 05:29.236
Okay, guys, I'm just
gonna take out the trash.

05:29.322 --> 05:30.679
Oh, wait, honey.

05:30.993 --> 05:32.576
Before you go...

05:37.674 --> 05:40.103
I will dance on your grave.

05:43.781 --> 05:45.308
What are we thinking?

05:45.589 --> 05:47.798
Are we feeling brave?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.341
It's just, we're not
good with change.

05:53.472 --> 05:55.592
Okay, but you're missing
out on the new salad.

05:55.678 --> 05:57.064
New salad?

05:57.654 --> 05:59.478
No. Not ready.

06:01.064 --> 06:02.176
Where's Tammy?

06:02.262 --> 06:04.869
She's home studying.
The GED's tomorrow.

06:04.955 --> 06:06.416
That's a shot at me, right?

06:06.502 --> 06:07.853
What are you talking about?

06:07.955 --> 06:09.057
Because I won't take the test

06:09.142 --> 06:10.767
and everyone's harassing me
about it.

06:10.853 --> 06:13.288
Oh, my God.
Shut up already.

06:13.471 --> 06:15.806
Take it, don't take it,
who cares?

06:15.892 --> 06:18.879
So, Christy quit smoking.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.019
Yay.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.468
I can wear silk again.

06:25.740 --> 06:27.835
And your health, and your health.

06:28.384 --> 06:30.074
Good for you, sweetie.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.476
And just so you know,

06:31.562 --> 06:34.038
the next few days
could be a little rocky.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.903
Will they, oh wise one?

06:38.020 --> 06:40.773
Why don't you just
shut the knowledge hole?

06:41.671 --> 06:44.656
Okay. Back to you,
Bonnie.

06:44.769 --> 06:46.788
Why wouldn't you
want to take the GED?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.981
Because I'm not good
at tests. I always fail.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.956
I'm not book-smart.
I'm street-smart.

06:51.042 --> 06:52.365
Which is better anyway.

06:52.574 --> 06:54.624
You know what never
saved my life? Geometry.

06:54.710 --> 06:55.843
You know what did?

06:55.929 --> 06:58.632
Being able to
tell if a drug dealer was a cop.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.463
White socks.

07:03.249 --> 07:05.877
I don't think you're giving
yourself enough credit.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.507
I mean, sure, maybe you
didn't do well in school,

07:08.593 --> 07:10.894
but you were drinking
and using back then.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.583
Wendy, what's new with you?

07:12.922 --> 07:14.624
Don't try to
change the subject

07:14.713 --> 07:16.484
by pretending to care about Wendy.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.179
Yeah.

07:20.804 --> 07:23.523
Bonnie, you can't let
fear get in your way.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.850
You're a strong,
sober woman now,

07:24.935 --> 07:26.791
and that means you're
capable of handling things

07:26.876 --> 07:29.093
that you couldn't handle
before.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.833
Well,

07:34.919 --> 07:35.974
that's beautiful.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.425
Beatrice, give me that new menu.

07:38.517 --> 07:40.932
Nope, nope. I spoke too soon.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.158
Do you realize
it's been 40 years

07:50.244 --> 07:52.330
since we sat together in a classroom?

07:52.658 --> 07:54.356
Longer than that, isn't it?

07:54.586 --> 07:56.330
Well, it was 1975.

07:56.416 --> 07:57.749
How many years is that?

08:03.501 --> 08:06.865
I'm starting to lose confidence
about the math section.

08:07.461 --> 08:09.394
All right, everybody,
turn off your phones.

08:09.479 --> 08:12.648
The test will begin in two minutes.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.622
I'm so glad we studied together.

08:14.707 --> 08:16.146
I feel so prepared.

08:16.231 --> 08:18.368
How you doing? Good, good, good, good.

08:19.408 --> 08:21.156
Hey, will you switch with me?

08:21.241 --> 08:22.798
- Why?
- There's a squirrel out here.

08:22.883 --> 08:24.705
It looks like he's wearing pants.

08:24.933 --> 08:27.359
- It's distracting.
- Yeah. Okay.

08:35.587 --> 08:37.755
This chair has a wobbly back.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.322
Hey. My
friend thinks you're cute.

08:44.434 --> 08:46.283
Would you mind swapping seats?

08:57.547 --> 09:00.099
- You okay?
- Perfect.

09:00.714 --> 09:04.040
Except Big Ben is ticking in my ear.

09:12.576 --> 09:14.482
Hey. Would you switch with me?

09:14.567 --> 09:16.567
Uh, that guy thinks you're cute.

09:22.093 --> 09:23.772
Hey, Bonnie!

09:24.051 --> 09:26.477
- So glad we're doing this together.
- Me, too.

09:27.385 --> 09:29.385
And begin.

09:38.988 --> 09:41.258
Which one of you is wearing perfume?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.492
Look at those lucky bastards,

09:47.704 --> 09:50.034
puffing away without
a care in the world.

09:50.119 --> 09:52.987
And all I've got is this
stupid cinnamon toothpick.

09:53.368 --> 09:56.057
Yeah, but you're going to
live longer than they are.

09:56.142 --> 09:57.805
Step away.

10:00.877 --> 10:03.175
Quitting smoking still hard?

10:03.260 --> 10:05.422
Yes, Jill. Yes, it is.

10:06.274 --> 10:08.346
Why don't you try that nicotine gum?

10:08.431 --> 10:09.878
It's supposed to take the edge off.

10:09.963 --> 10:14.047
Hmm. Do you know how much
that nicotine gum costs?

10:14.638 --> 10:17.774
Do you know how much
anything costs, you princess?

10:19.402 --> 10:21.737
I know that if you keep
talking to me like that,

10:21.823 --> 10:24.597
this princess is gonna pop you
right in that cute button nose.

10:24.721 --> 10:27.157
Aw, go ahead.

10:27.367 --> 10:30.091
And I'll give you a
refreshing cinnamon blast

10:30.176 --> 10:32.126
right in the eye.

10:32.656 --> 10:35.805
You know what? I'm
gonna go scrub the sink.

10:35.942 --> 10:38.102
Come on, Wendy, show me how.

10:40.141 --> 10:42.770
Don't we usually have
more cookies left over?

10:42.855 --> 10:44.461
Christy ate, like, 30 of them.

10:44.546 --> 10:46.461
Do not ask her about it.

10:46.748 --> 10:49.347
Oh, my God, you guys. I
got my score. I passed!

10:49.432 --> 10:51.720
Oh, fantastic.

10:53.872 --> 10:55.321
Mom, did you get yours?

10:55.506 --> 10:56.812
I failed.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.313
What? No.

10:58.398 --> 10:59.860
No, it's okay. I'm good.

11:00.431 --> 11:03.235
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.071
This one would like to stay out.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.657
Mom, you okay?

11:27.782 --> 11:29.138
Want a cookie?

11:29.262 --> 11:30.750
Toothpick?

11:31.652 --> 11:33.836
Split a pack of cigarettes?

11:35.305 --> 11:37.570
I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.961
And stop eating these.

11:39.055 --> 11:41.605
I talked you into
this. It's all my fault.

11:41.690 --> 11:43.292
No, it's not. I failed a test.

11:43.377 --> 11:45.043
I've done it a million times.

11:45.148 --> 11:46.906
You knew this stuff. What happened?

11:46.992 --> 11:48.632
What always happens... I couldn't focus.

11:48.817 --> 11:51.058
I forgot everything.
I didn't even finish.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.466
It didn't help that the
room was, like, 1,000 degrees

11:53.551 --> 11:55.732
and there were sirens and
dogs and a mouth breather

11:55.818 --> 11:57.216
who sounded like Darth Vader.

11:57.301 --> 12:00.646
Seriously, try to concentrate
with this going on behind you.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.370
Bonnie, when can you
take the test again?

12:07.455 --> 12:09.028
Never. Now, come on, let's go celebrate

12:09.113 --> 12:11.914
the one person in this
room who actually is smart.

12:12.602 --> 12:15.143
I don't know how many times
I have to remind you people

12:15.242 --> 12:18.812
I have a master's degree
in art history, but okay.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.769
I'll meet you guys outside.
I got to go to the bathroom.

12:21.854 --> 12:23.316
- So do you.
- Oh, so do I.

12:23.401 --> 12:24.584
What's up?

12:24.669 --> 12:26.608
I just feel bad celebrating
in front of Bonnie.

12:26.693 --> 12:28.166
Oh, that's understandable.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.378
But, honey, this is a big deal.

12:30.463 --> 12:32.821
And it's okay for you
to be proud of yourself.

12:32.906 --> 12:35.013
Good, 'cause I'm really,
really proud of myself.

12:35.098 --> 12:36.768
I passed, I passed, I passed.

12:36.853 --> 12:38.673
- Come on, Marge, dance with me.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.892
Okay, okay. I passed, I passed.

12:39.977 --> 12:42.144
My hip. My back. My leg.

12:46.050 --> 12:48.985
Uh-uh, Christy, we're
waiting over here for them.

12:49.232 --> 12:51.265
I'm coming.

12:51.434 --> 12:53.979
Hey, Bonnie, have you ever
thought you might have A.D.D.?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.721
Now, why would she
have an alarm company?

12:55.807 --> 12:57.532
She barely has any furniture.

12:57.799 --> 12:59.789
Attention deficit disorder.

12:59.874 --> 13:01.707
Oh, that you definitely have.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.232
Really, Jill? Is that
your master's degree

13:04.317 --> 13:06.391
in finger painting talking?

13:06.476 --> 13:08.620
You know, it would explain a lot.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.478
Why don't you go back
to whatever crab boat

13:10.563 --> 13:12.179
you're the captain of?

13:12.566 --> 13:14.292
I know a doctor who can test you.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.507
- Ugh.
- Wouldn't kill you to check it out.

13:16.593 --> 13:18.213
Actually, I think it
would, because if I find out

13:18.298 --> 13:19.965
I have one more thing wrong
with me, I'm gonna go home

13:20.050 --> 13:21.362
and put my head in the oven.

13:21.464 --> 13:24.029
It's electric, but you can try.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.391
All right, let's go.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.761
It's okay, blow right in my face.

13:34.199 --> 13:35.790
Christy!

13:36.221 --> 13:39.222
Love you guys. Smell you tomorrow.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.764
Oh. What are you doing up?

13:46.849 --> 13:48.610
Nothing. What are you doing up?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.292
Nothing.

13:58.472 --> 13:59.605
What are you looking for?

14:00.971 --> 14:02.714
I thought I might have
some ice cream is all.

14:02.799 --> 14:05.495
Oh, good, 'cause I threw out
the cigarettes you hid in there.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.080
Damn it.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.049
So, why are you really up?

14:11.424 --> 14:13.291
I'm reading about A.D.D.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.804
I found this online test
that helps you figure out

14:15.889 --> 14:17.909
- if you might have it.
- Did you take it?

14:18.034 --> 14:19.808
About half, and then I
found your credit card

14:19.893 --> 14:22.394
and bought a pair of yoga
pants, just for old time's sake.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.030
Well, first, give me my card.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.364
It's already back in your wallet.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.245
What is this, amateur hour?

14:28.948 --> 14:31.262
All right, let me see this test.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.265
Do you have trouble finishing
projects and activities?

14:37.350 --> 14:39.067
That's when I saw the
ad for the yoga pants,

14:39.152 --> 14:41.761
so what do you think, sometimes?

14:42.803 --> 14:44.586
Sure.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.691
Have you ever experienced
problems with drugs and alcohol?

15:00.613 --> 15:02.917
Do you ever have
difficulty staying focused

15:03.003 --> 15:05.497
during boring or repetitive tasks?

15:05.582 --> 15:07.136
What's going on?

15:07.784 --> 15:09.190
Things were heating up in there,

15:09.275 --> 15:11.245
and then you just wandered off.

15:22.512 --> 15:24.292
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes.

15:31.565 --> 15:33.315
There it is.

15:33.857 --> 15:35.605
Right?

15:38.198 --> 15:39.581
Thought you quit.

15:39.941 --> 15:41.393
I did.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.363
Twice this morning, and
again ten minutes ago.

15:46.778 --> 15:47.995
I don't get it.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.055
Why was I able to quit
drinking, drugs and gambling,

15:51.140 --> 15:52.355
but I can't beat this?

15:52.441 --> 15:54.761
Well, 'cause you had a lot of support

15:54.871 --> 15:56.394
with those other things.

15:56.479 --> 15:59.253
You ever considered Nicotine Anonymous?

16:00.366 --> 16:03.878
Do you get a kickback for
every group you get me into?

16:05.135 --> 16:07.300
- No more programs.
- Okay.

16:07.411 --> 16:09.801
Maybe you're not ready to stop.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.356
But I hate it. My friends hate it.

16:12.441 --> 16:13.805
It makes me smell bad.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.329
It's wreaking havoc on my skin.

16:15.414 --> 16:17.020
My teeth are turning yellow.

16:17.105 --> 16:19.745
I'm hacking up stuff that
should not come from a human.

16:19.932 --> 16:22.268
Excuse me, can you take this inside?

16:23.549 --> 16:25.848
This is my last one,
and then I'm quitting.

16:26.101 --> 16:29.471
Yeah, this is my last one, too.

16:35.237 --> 16:37.445
Hi. I'm Bonnie, and I'm an alcoholic.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.613
Hi, Bonnie.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.222
So, I just came from the doctor,

16:41.307 --> 16:44.240
and he says I have
attention deficit disorder.

16:45.653 --> 16:48.954
And it kind of explains my whole life.

16:49.255 --> 16:51.823
My trouble at school, jobs,

16:52.428 --> 16:54.049
relationships.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.298
Good news is he says
I can take the GED again

16:57.383 --> 16:59.133
and ask for extra time.

16:59.341 --> 17:01.302
I can even take it in a room by myself

17:01.387 --> 17:03.877
if I want to, where
there are no distractions.

17:04.862 --> 17:06.424
You know, a do-over.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.310
I kind of wish I could get a do-over

17:09.395 --> 17:11.451
for the other stuff I've
messed up in my life.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.096
God.

17:15.488 --> 17:17.419
How did no one notice this?

17:18.010 --> 17:20.155
I mean, if one foster parent

17:20.240 --> 17:22.063
or teacher or anybody had said,

17:22.147 --> 17:24.682
"Hey, this kid isn't dumb,
she just needs a little help,"

17:24.794 --> 17:26.560
everything could have been different.

17:26.971 --> 17:29.297
I mean, I've spent my entire
freaking life struggling,

17:29.382 --> 17:32.404
and now I find out it
didn't have to be that way?

17:35.122 --> 17:36.795
Who knows what I could have done?

17:41.928 --> 17:43.261
That's all I got.

17:45.568 --> 17:46.731
Oh, one more thing.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.257
If you've ever been mad
at me for falling asleep

17:49.342 --> 17:51.686
or texting while you're
sharing, you can't be.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.521
I have A.D.D.
