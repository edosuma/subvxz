00:04.250 --> 00:05.820
[Maddie] Previously on Siren.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.071
My dad talked
to the ME. about Decker.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.877
She said there was something
going on in his brain.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.029
Will you sing to me?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.610
[singing Siren song]

00:12.620 --> 00:13.951
Do you know what it means?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.109
Great love to some.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.247
For others, a euphemism
for obsession.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.877
Did I hear your friend
say you have a boat?

00:18.880 --> 00:20.279
It's just
a old fishing tub.

00:20.290 --> 00:21.530
Never been on a fishing boat.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.666
Lieutenant _lVlartinez
reporting.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.285
I've followed the trail,

00:24.290 --> 00:26.201
gained access,
secured the location.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.325
I'll be in touch.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.661
[Maddie]
My mom's back.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.740
-You think she's clean?
-No Idea.

00:30.750 --> 00:33.116
I'm sorry it had
to go this way, okay?
I tried to intervene.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.497
Marissa will step in
while we figure out
next steps.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.661
[Dale] You mean while you
find my replacement? Thanks.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.161
There's some kind
of disturbance.
Sound waves.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.239
Aah!

00:43.040 --> 00:44.496
[Helen]
What are they doing back?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.491
[Maddie]
They were forced out.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.706
Oh, my God!

01:21.380 --> 01:22.745
[sniffs]

01:22.750 --> 01:23.990
[hisses]

01:42.880 --> 01:46.611
[geese calling]

01:46.620 --> 01:47.780
You like it.

01:47.790 --> 01:50.167
It is good for us here.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.415
Family.

01:56.380 --> 01:57.745
Yes.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.707
Okay.

02:02.710 --> 02:03.779
We go back.

02:08.790 --> 02:09.779
Your mother.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.286
My sister.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.240
Gone.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.117
[woman singing somber song]

02:30.580 --> 02:33.458
[distressed breathing]

02:36.670 --> 02:39.537
We shall follow

02:39.540 --> 02:41.371
I help you now.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.827
You are strong.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.206
Like mother.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.324
[soft hiss]

02:57.670 --> 03:00.412
Humans bring food.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.456
Humans. [hisses]

03:04.920 --> 03:06.820
We go back.

03:06.830 --> 03:07.990
Now.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.700
Unh!

03:18.380 --> 03:20.450
[placid high-pitched call]

03:21.830 --> 03:23.821
[Kelli]
My son came into my room.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.326
I was in bad shape.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.456
And he looked at me
and he said,

03:28.460 --> 03:29.950
"Mommy, I love you,

03:29.960 --> 03:32.372
and I'm scared
you're gonna die."

03:32.380 --> 03:34.109
That was it.

03:34.120 --> 03:37.328
Finally had to choose
between the drugs and my kid.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.991
Your love for your son
is inspiring.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.285
And that love
is gonna help you.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.612
For all of us, the way
out of our addiction

03:47.620 --> 03:49.110
is through relationships.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.872
You can't do it alone.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.496
[door slams]

03:58.500 --> 04:00.240
[facilitator] Looks like
we got a few newcomers
with us today.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.161
If anyone else
would like to share.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.576
All right.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.207
[clears throat]

04:07.210 --> 04:10.373
Uh, I'm-- I'm Ben.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.995
-Hey, Ben.
-[others] Hi, Ben.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.490
[facilitator]
What brings you here today?

04:13.500 --> 04:16.663
Uh, it's... It's kind
of hard to explain.

04:16.670 --> 04:17.659
Um...

04:20.330 --> 04:21.991
Iwas in a...

04:24.460 --> 04:26.280
a complicated relationship,

04:29.380 --> 04:33.032
got obsessive,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.371
I guess.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.919
Started feeling unhealthy,

04:42.420 --> 04:47.289
so, uh, I'm--
I'm not sure what to do when

04:49.920 --> 04:53.959
a relationship
is the addiction.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.370
-Thanks, Ben.
-Thank you, Ben.

05:06.420 --> 05:07.409
[dog barking]

05:07.420 --> 05:08.455
[door closes]

05:15.250 --> 05:19.573
I, uh... I got you
a matcha latte
from Lilly's.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.411
Oh. Thank you.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.321
How's the, uh--
How's the family reunion?

05:26.420 --> 05:28.411
My dad seems happy, so...

05:37.580 --> 05:39.957
So that oil company,

05:39.960 --> 05:42.372
they're mapping
a thousand square miles
of ocean.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.574
That's gonna take months.

05:43.580 --> 05:46.879
-Eight.
-Eight months?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.609
How are we gonna manage them
for eight months?

05:48.620 --> 05:51.168
Uh... carefully?

05:59.290 --> 06:01.747
-Good morning.
-Hey.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.456
I was gonna
make breakfast, but

06:03.460 --> 06:06.827
all you had was
this shitty coffee
and stale bread.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.913
Yeah, well, you should see
the other boats on this clock.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.740
This is...
This is luxury.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.035
Mm.

06:25.330 --> 06:26.820
Can I ask you something?

06:26.830 --> 06:28.661
Yeah, sure.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.321
You said your dad died
not too long ago.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.036
Did it happen here?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.325
On this boat?

06:38.670 --> 06:41.491
So this is a sex first,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.616
ask questions later
kind of relationship, huh?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.668
You got a problem with that?

06:45.670 --> 06:47.376
Not really. [laughs]

06:48.920 --> 06:50.035
But, uh...

06:51.500 --> 06:53.036
Yeah, it happened here.

06:54.710 --> 06:58.612
We were, um, out on a run.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.536
This big storm.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.496
Main net got caught
on its spindle.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.570
My dad went to clear it.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.571
Something happened.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.535
Pulled him overboard.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.615
Was just gone.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.916
-Damn.
-Yeah.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.569
I'm sorry.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.572
Now I gotta get
this boat back together.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.741
My dad left
a big ol' pile of debt, so...

07:24.750 --> 07:27.241
That's a lot to deal with.

07:30.830 --> 07:33.788
All I ever saw
was how strong her was.

07:33.790 --> 07:36.281
Fishing boat captain.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.417
Major tough ass.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.451
But he was just a guy,
you know,

07:43.710 --> 07:45.416
just trying to get by.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.995
That's kinda the thing
about life.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.070
I mean, you could
wake up one morning

07:51.080 --> 07:52.661
and make a choice,

07:52.670 --> 07:54.490
change everything
about yourself.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.824
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:07.830 --> 08:09.878
Pajamas
and slippers day, huh?

08:09.880 --> 08:12.201
Well, I figured I'd watch
a couple of game shows

08:12.210 --> 08:14.417
and catch up
on my soap operas.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.069
[Susan]
You know what I think?

08:16.080 --> 08:19.379
You are the best thing
that happened to this town,

08:19.380 --> 08:20.665
and the council better
come to Its senses

08:20.670 --> 08:21.819
and give you your job back.

08:21.830 --> 08:24.572
Well, whatever's
meant to be will be.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.877
Haida-Zen, yadda-yadda.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.166
You gotta fight back.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.991
I don't even understand
why they fired you
in the first place.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.160
How was the meeting
this morning?

08:34.670 --> 08:36.069
I saw Ben Pownall.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.707
Really?

08:37.710 --> 08:40.577
And I'm assuming that
Maddie knows about this.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.036
Actually, I'm not sure.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.701
Well, either way,
it's not good for her.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.247
Growing up with an addict,
and now dating one?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.786
It's my fault.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.701
I'm gonna have to help her
get away from him.

08:49.710 --> 08:53.953
Uh, I'd think about that
before giving her dating advice.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.038
Yeah. You're probably right.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.247
One step at a time.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.037
-[Maddie] Got it?
-[Ben] Yeah.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.871
Could be ugly in here.

09:07.540 --> 09:08.575
Ben!

09:19.710 --> 09:21.325
[hisses]

09:21.330 --> 09:22.911
[Helen] I couldn't
sleep last night.

09:25.170 --> 09:28.537
I finally conked out
around 3:00 AM.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.871
They must
have slipped out early.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.246
You were supposed
to be watching them.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.706
You're the den mother.

09:33.710 --> 09:35.666
Yeah, well, den mother's
got a lousy back.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.069
-[hisses]
-[Helen] Hey!

09:37.080 --> 09:38.570
No need to push.

09:38.580 --> 09:41.708
Have you been watching
Ryn with them?

09:41.710 --> 09:42.950
Yeah.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.779
Hello.

09:50.460 --> 09:51.495
Hello.

09:54.670 --> 09:55.739
Hello.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.411
Hello.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.701
Hello.

10:06.710 --> 10:07.916
Hello.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.114
Hello.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.111
Sister's daughter.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.576
Really?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.069
Oh.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.449
Thank you.

10:37.830 --> 10:38.876
[hisses]

10:38.880 --> 10:39.869
[hisses]

10:49.960 --> 10:51.109
[Ben]
Hey,no,no,no,no,no.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.452
That's food. We eat that.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.286
Ta-da.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.416
[soft hiss]

11:04.290 --> 11:05.530
You want to try?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.785
-Yeah.
-[Maddie chuckles]

11:10.790 --> 11:11.825
Good.

11:13.330 --> 11:15.616
Hey, hey, hey.

11:15.620 --> 11:16.826
Ryn?

11:18.210 --> 11:19.279
Her skin.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.575
It's already getting bad.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.910
They need to go back.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.410
How?

11:25.420 --> 11:28.071
Those sonic waves
almost killed you out there.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.911
They can't go back
in the water.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.490
[rock music playing,
indistinct conversations]

11:45.290 --> 11:46.780
Calvin?

11:46.790 --> 11:47.779
That's me.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.576
Ian Sutton, KFGT News?

11:49.580 --> 11:50.877
I texted you this morning.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.780
Oh, hey. Hey.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.748
Thanks for coming
all the way from Seattle
to talk to me.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.785
[laughs]

11:56.790 --> 11:58.326
I-- I didn't.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.491
I came up here to report
on those beached whales.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.287
I figured while I was up here,
I'd follow up on your call.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.453
Bristol Cove isn't
exactly our regular beat.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.995
Okay, cool.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.958
So what'd you want
to talk to me about?

12:17.880 --> 12:21.031
You know
how Bristol Cove is big

12:21.040 --> 12:21.950
into the whole mermaid thing?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.287
Yep, I'm gettin' that.

12:26.290 --> 12:27.871
Well, check this out.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.825
What, a sea lion?

12:33.830 --> 12:34.819
That's no sea lion.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.036
Then what is it?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.246
It's a mermaid.

12:38.380 --> 12:39.369
A real one.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.416
No kidding?

12:41.420 --> 12:44.617
Hey, what does a story
like that usually pay?

12:44.620 --> 12:46.201
Calvin, we're
a news organization.

12:46.210 --> 12:48.030
We don't pay for our stories.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.246
Look, you want
to sell a story

12:49.250 --> 12:50.911
about a real-life mermaid?

12:50.920 --> 12:52.285
Call the Enquirer.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.452
Okay, the exploration
starts here

13:03.460 --> 13:04.870
and moves south.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.029
And the sonic waves

13:06.040 --> 13:09.453
amplify as they move out
at least 500 miles.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.325
[Maddie] Maybe we could
take them out past that.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.491
Could you go
far out into the ocean

13:13.500 --> 13:14.615
where the sound is okay?

13:14.620 --> 13:17.327
No. There are others.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.661
Strong ones.

13:18.670 --> 13:19.955
They will fight us.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.075
Other colonies?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.662
They protect their water.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.666
They're territorial.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.497
[Helen] They can't last
much longer here.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.910
They need to go back tonight.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.706
I got some ideas.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.918
Now, there are some places,
given the topography,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.911
that the _sound in the water
mIght be less.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.456
I can show them to you.

13:41.460 --> 13:42.950
Okay, yes.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.030
When will the oil project
be finished?

13:45.040 --> 13:46.610
Eight months.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.110
[Helen]
Eight months?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.917
We need to feed them,

13:49.920 --> 13:51.706
clothe them,

13:51.710 --> 13:54.076
maybe find them
somewhere new to stay.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.071
We're gonna need money.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.071
Yes, money.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.493
[Helen]
You won't ask your father
for anything, I know,

14:01.500 --> 14:02.706
but I can.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.826
_ And he
Will give It to me.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.916
You show me the water.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.958
Wait, Ryn,
no, we can't leave them here.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.746
I tell them to stay.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.035
They listen to me.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.576
I'll watch them.

14:18.580 --> 14:21.708
Maddie, I don't feel
good about this.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.996
It's okay.
They're degrading.
They're weaker.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.569
I can handle it.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.995
Just in case.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.820
Hello, Berta.

15:05.830 --> 15:07.377
I'm here to see boss.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.496
_ Mr. Pownall is
In a meetIng rIght now.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.070
Ch. I'll wait.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.370
Helen!

15:13.380 --> 15:14.665
Don't mind!

15:16.380 --> 15:18.166
Ah, luck.

15:18.170 --> 15:19.376
Perfect timing.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.452
Meg, Jack,
thanks for coming.

15:24.790 --> 15:25.996
Helen?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.206
Ted.

15:27.210 --> 15:29.030
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

15:31.210 --> 15:34.031
[Ben] All the other coves
around here are deep water,

15:34.040 --> 15:36.247
so the sound
will be very bad.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.036
Now, this one is shallow.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.031
If they stay
close to the shore,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.496
the sonic effect
will be less.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.877
I think this is
our best choice.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.246
The people are here.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.490
Yeah. We'll do it at night.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.819
There won't be
anyone here.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.371
[startled]

16:01.420 --> 16:03.240
It's fire.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.206
We use it to cook our food.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.075
[gaSPSI

16:10.080 --> 16:11.411
Careful. It's hot.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.035
Fire can be dangerous.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.949
[hisses]

16:27.120 --> 16:28.075
[soft hiss]

16:30.460 --> 16:31.449
[hisses]

16:38.290 --> 16:40.110
[grunting hisses]

16:50.540 --> 16:52.326
Great.
I'll have these filed,

16:52.330 --> 16:55.242
and it should take
one or two busmess days
to release the funds.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.319
Thank you.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.457
I was always told
that this money

17:01.460 --> 17:05.282
was to keep your side
of the family quiet.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.953
We have always lived up
to our side of the bargain.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.370
Your mother
and your grandmother

17:10.380 --> 17:11.950
knew to keep
the fund intact.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.110
I'm the end
of the line, Ted.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.748
There's nowhere else
for It to go.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.321
[Ted]
Why all of a sudden? Huh?

17:19.330 --> 17:20.285
What's it for?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.167
It's none of your business.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.417
Maybe I'll buy
a Maserati.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.160
[Ted] Xander?

17:31.580 --> 17:33.070
Oh, uh, hey.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.160
Hey, Mr. Pownall.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.785
You okay?

17:35.790 --> 17:39.749
Yeah. I'm just, um,
you know, making a deposit.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.786
You always put on
a shirt and tie
to make a deposit?

17:44.540 --> 17:46.781
Um, it's the North Star,

17:46.790 --> 17:48.917
she needs fixing.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.208
Figured on a loan, huh?

17:53.580 --> 17:55.161
That's good.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.785
Your dad, he made
a lot of sacrifices

17:56.790 --> 17:58.280
to keep his company going.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.167
He'd be proud you're
doing the same thing.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.166
Okay.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.661
[Ryn]
Where do we go?

18:11.670 --> 18:13.160
We're gonna
get you something

18:13.170 --> 18:15.070
that's gonna help you
get by here on land.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.412
[camera clicking]

18:17.420 --> 18:20.287
Uh, okay,
let's try that again,

18:20.290 --> 18:22.246
but this time,
eyes open.

18:25.210 --> 18:27.030
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.996
Okay, we'll use that one.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.160
Okay.

18:33.330 --> 18:34.786
[Ben] Are you sure
this is gonna work?

18:34.790 --> 18:38.078
Dude, this like
the Mona Lisa of fake I.D.s

18:38.080 --> 18:40.071
You don't have to worry
about getting carded, ever.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.413
Okay, Ryn, R-Y-N.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.409
Last name?

18:49.250 --> 18:50.660
Fisher.

18:50.670 --> 18:53.207
Ryn Fisher.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.872
Okay, I'm gonna put
your age at 22.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.450
Learn this date.

18:57.460 --> 18:58.449
Know your sign.

18:58.460 --> 18:59.825
Sign.

18:59.830 --> 19:02.458
Uh, yeah, you're a Pisces.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.950
Okay.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.109
And...

19:09.500 --> 19:12.287
And voil.

19:12.290 --> 19:14.110
Your new driver's license.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.247
May it bring you many years
of happy drinking.

19:21.710 --> 19:26.283

20:25.330 --> 20:28.037
I am Pisces, 22.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.079
Uh, yes,
that is how old you are.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.457
How long you've been alive.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.745
22 years.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.490
Years.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.616
Uh, it's...

20:39.620 --> 20:41.417
It's one of the ways
we tell time.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.911
How do you measure time
in the ocean?

20:43.920 --> 20:46.491
Um, maybe by the tides?

20:46.500 --> 20:48.115
The whales.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.200
When they go, come back.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.576
Yeah, annual migration.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.572
Okay, so how many times
have the whales

20:56.580 --> 20:59.458
gone and come back
since you were born?

20:59.460 --> 21:00.825
Many times.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.071
Like, 50?

21:04.500 --> 21:05.990
What, a hundred?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.490
Stop.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.535
-What?
-Stop the car.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.280
What? What? Okay. Okay.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.371
I will drive.

21:14.380 --> 21:17.531
No. Just 'cause
you have a lIcense,

21:17.540 --> 21:19.371
-it doesn't mean--
-I want to learn.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.416
We gotta get back
to the cabin.

21:21.420 --> 21:24.036
There is time.
They go at night.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.278
All right.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.280
Okay. [clears throat]

21:29.290 --> 21:31.281
A driving lesson

21:31.290 --> 21:33.167
with a mermaid.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.877
That is the brake.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.370
Good.
That makes you stop.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.166
And this is the gas.

21:40.170 --> 21:41.535
[engine revs]

21:41.540 --> 21:43.076
Very gentle.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.957
This is the steering wheel.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.531
You move it this way
to go that way.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.667
This way, you go there.

21:49.670 --> 21:50.785
You understand?

21:50.790 --> 21:51.950
I do.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.370
I watch you drive.

21:56.210 --> 21:57.325
Okay.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.371
You ready?

22:01.380 --> 22:02.950
Ready.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.417
[AJR]
Way up, way up, we go

22:05.420 --> 22:06.785
[Ben] Brakes! Brakes!

22:06.790 --> 22:08.451

22:08.460 --> 22:10.781

-Easy, okay?

22:10.790 --> 22:13.202
- We gon' burn
the whole house down
-Easy.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.246
Watch me stand in the line

22:15.250 --> 22:17.616
Yeah. Straighten up.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.167
- You're only servin' lies
-Good, good.

-Yeah.

-I'm a good driver.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, look.

22:39.670 --> 22:42.662
Hey. Hey, Mr. McClure.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.956
Uh, Xander.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.781
So I talked with my manager.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.280
Yeah?

22:49.290 --> 22:50.871
I really pushed
for you on this one,

22:50.880 --> 22:52.780
but we ran the numbers,

22:52.790 --> 22:55.827
and, unfortunately, it's saying
that we can't approve this loan.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.570
It would be too high a risk.

22:57.580 --> 23:00.162
So I'm too high of a risk?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.661
Just according to the numbers.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.490
[sighs]

23:08.920 --> 23:10.069
You went to Bristol, right?

23:10.080 --> 23:11.115
Well, yeah.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.111
I was a class behind you.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.031
I was on cheer squad
when you played football.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.031
Go Whalers!

23:17.040 --> 23:20.669
Yeah. Yeah, you were
kind of a dick back then, too.

["Burn Down The House"

23:29.290 --> 23:30.496
Should I keep it light?

[laughing] Whoa!

23:31.710 --> 23:34.281
Okay, okay, okay.
[laughing]

23:34.290 --> 23:35.666
If I write a song

23:36.710 --> 23:39.497
You are okay?

Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.821
I'm-- I'm-- I'm laughing.
It's funny.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.496
Funny.

23:46.500 --> 23:50.322
It's like, uh,
when you feel good

23:50.330 --> 23:51.820
and you're happy.

23:51.830 --> 23:56.073
I don't know. I don't
know how to explain it.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.617
Way up, way up, oh no

23:58.620 --> 24:02.659
[forced laughter]

24:05.790 --> 24:07.371
No, no, no, no, no.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.701
You can't force it.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.746
It just has to happen.

24:11.750 --> 24:15.072
I would like to laugh someday.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.571
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.951
What if the way
I feel about you

24:31.080 --> 24:32.616
has nothing to do
with the song?

24:36.880 --> 24:39.872
Yes, Ben.

24:41.750 --> 24:42.614
Maybe.

Wolves don't
usually attack people.

that they were predators,

I'm sorry.
They just snuck out.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.780
I should have been
more careful.

26:33.670 --> 26:36.491
Like what you see

26:36.500 --> 26:38.491
-Oh, watch the clams!
-Yep, all right.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.536
Whoo!

26:43.040 --> 26:44.416
Comin' through.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.409
Prelim!

26:49.750 --> 26:51.240
Hey!

26:54.540 --> 26:56.326
Whoo. [laughing]

26:56.330 --> 26:59.037
Whaddup, fishes!

26:59.040 --> 27:01.918
I forgot how fun
this town can be.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.659
Yeah.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.167
Except I feel like people
are totally looking at me.

27:07.170 --> 27:08.785
[Dale]
Oh, don't be silly.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.109
It's true, Dale.
How do you not see it?

27:11.500 --> 27:12.876
Listen, of all the nights,

27:12.880 --> 27:14.950
this is not the one
where people are lookIng at you.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.616
I see you lookin', lookin'

27:18.620 --> 27:19.609
Lookin' at me

27:25.580 --> 27:27.070
They're in.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.617
And they know to come
straight back out?

27:29.620 --> 27:31.497
Yes. I tell them.

27:33.790 --> 27:35.997
[male singer]
Oh, girl, I like it

27:36.000 --> 27:38.616
Anytime, anyplace, aanhere

27:38.620 --> 27:39.951
Just a few hours

27:39.960 --> 27:41.279
-Here you go.
-[man] Thank you.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.827
Honey, I'm melting

27:43.830 --> 27:45.320
You're working here
now, huh?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.070
Janine hooked me up,
few days a week.

27:47.080 --> 27:50.743
So that means you're
staying in town then.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.787
Huh. This town's really got
mermaids on the brain.

27:53.790 --> 27:55.166
What's up with that?

27:55.170 --> 27:58.492
Yeah. You don't know
the half of it.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.570
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.373
[man] Let's roll!
Everybody down to the beach!

28:12.080 --> 28:13.707
[bar patrons shouting]

28:16.250 --> 28:18.912
[man] Come on!
Get in the water!

28:18.920 --> 28:21.377
Oh, my God, you've
gotta be kidding me!

28:21.380 --> 28:22.870
No, no, no, no!
You can't go in!

28:22.880 --> 28:24.780
-It's not safe!
-Stop!

28:24.790 --> 28:26.166
Wait! No, wait!

28:26.170 --> 28:27.876
[Ben] Hey, no, no!
You can't go in there!

28:27.880 --> 28:30.667
-Stop!
-[Maddie] Get out!

28:30.670 --> 28:32.069
It's not safe!
You have to get out!

28:32.080 --> 28:34.378
-[Helen] Stop!
-[Ben] No, you can't go in here!

28:34.380 --> 28:35.608
-Wait!
-Stop!

28:35.620 --> 28:36.951
-No, you can't.
-[hisses]

28:36.960 --> 28:38.370
[Maddie] Come on,
get out of the water!

28:38.380 --> 28:40.416
We should go for a dip.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.739
You're crazy.

28:43.580 --> 28:44.877
Dad! Dad!

28:44.880 --> 28:45.824
Hi, sweetie.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.821
I need to talk
to you, alone.

28:47.830 --> 28:49.161
[crowd shouting]

28:49.170 --> 28:51.377
[man] Guess who's
goin' in there!

28:51.380 --> 28:52.608
[Helen] Get out!

28:52.620 --> 28:54.030
[music playing]

28:54.040 --> 28:55.576
Get out of the water!

28:55.580 --> 28:57.616
[laughing]

28:57.620 --> 28:59.451
[muffled music]

29:03.880 --> 29:06.030
Everybody, out of the water!

29:06.040 --> 29:07.166
Now!

29:07.170 --> 29:08.535
[Ben]
You have to get out!

29:12.210 --> 29:13.199
Aah!

29:13.210 --> 29:14.495
Everybody, out of the water!

29:14.500 --> 29:15.819
Out of the water now!

29:15.830 --> 29:16.819
Ryn, no!

29:16.830 --> 29:19.708
[screaming]

29:19.710 --> 29:21.826
Get out! Come on!

29:21.830 --> 29:23.821
Dale, what is going on?!

29:23.830 --> 29:25.070
Maddie, can you take
your mother home?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.877
Sure. Come on.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.029
Get out!

29:28.040 --> 29:30.247
[panicked screams]

29:32.040 --> 29:34.281
[panting hisses]

29:37.790 --> 29:39.951
We're locking it down.

29:39.960 --> 29:40.915
Any idea
what happened out there?

29:40.920 --> 29:43.411
Yeah, I talked
to Ben about it.

29:43.420 --> 29:45.536
He said it's
probably a sea lion.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.280
Shouldn't have been
in the water.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.957
You know
what happened tonight?

29:54.080 --> 29:55.320
It's them.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.069
How many?

29:59.920 --> 30:02.070
A small group, six.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.071
[scoffs, laughs]

30:04.080 --> 30:07.743
Xander, they're
gonna be back on land
a little longer.

30:07.750 --> 30:11.208
An oil company is doing
some exploration work.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.531
The sound pollution,
they can't take it.

30:15.920 --> 30:16.909
Xan,

30:18.920 --> 30:20.205
he's with them.

30:21.290 --> 30:23.497
The one who killed my dad?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.206
Yeah.

30:25.210 --> 30:27.030
Look, I just...

30:27.040 --> 30:30.032
I need to know
that you're gonna
be okay with it.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.325
[laughs]

30:36.040 --> 30:39.112
Have you--
Have you lost your mind?!

30:39.120 --> 30:41.076
Look, get out of my way!

30:41.080 --> 30:42.661
Come here,
you son of a bitch!

30:42.670 --> 30:44.456
Come here!

30:44.460 --> 30:48.078
-Come here!
-No! No, Xander! No!

30:48.080 --> 30:50.822
-Get off of me!
-Xan!

30:50.830 --> 30:51.819
[Helen] Dale!

30:51.830 --> 30:52.819
Come here!

30:52.830 --> 30:54.115
You want them here, huh?!

30:54.120 --> 30:55.610
In our town?!

30:55.620 --> 30:57.076
Really, Ben?!

30:57.080 --> 30:58.286
[grunting]

30:58.290 --> 30:59.700
Oh! [groans]

30:59.710 --> 31:02.031
Stop! Xan, stop!

31:02.040 --> 31:03.029
Knock it off, both of you!

31:03.040 --> 31:05.167
Xander, stop it!

31:05.170 --> 31:06.740
Stop it!

31:06.750 --> 31:07.739
[Xander grunts]

31:11.830 --> 31:14.162
I'm not the risk!

31:14.170 --> 31:15.819
Okay? They're the risk!

31:25.880 --> 31:27.871
He's gonna be a problem.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.030
Humans stay angry.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.951
[Susan]
What the hell?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.370
Do you think I'm gonna
make it through like this?

31:36.380 --> 31:37.995
What?!

31:38.000 --> 31:39.410
You ignore me!

31:39.420 --> 31:41.160
People in town are
whispering behind my back!

31:41.170 --> 31:43.286
Your father sends me home

31:43.290 --> 31:46.077
as if I couldn't
possibly understand
what's going on!

31:46.080 --> 31:50.699
You know how much
work I have done
to come back here?

31:50.710 --> 31:54.202
Okay, Mom. Sorry it doesn't
look how you want it to.

31:54.210 --> 31:55.666
Guess it's gonna take time.

31:55.670 --> 31:56.705
[Susan] Why?

31:58.080 --> 32:00.071
[sniffles, sighs]

32:00.080 --> 32:00.956
Why?

32:03.080 --> 32:04.570
Maybe because
of all the days

32:04.580 --> 32:06.161
teachers had to walk
me home from school

32:06.170 --> 32:08.877
'cause you were too wasted
to come get me.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.826
Or how I never had
friends over

32:11.830 --> 32:14.458
so they wouldn't see my mom
strung out, watching TV

32:14.460 --> 32:16.200
in the middle of the day!

32:16.210 --> 32:20.112
And then you just disappear,
a day, two days.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.113
This time, new record,
almost a year.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.248
You don't get to erase
all that by showing up
for a week.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.662
So you've got patience
for Ben, but not for me, huh?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.161
I know
about your boyfriend.

32:36.750 --> 32:37.990
That he's an addict.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.787
What are you talking about?

32:40.790 --> 32:43.748
I saw Ben _
at a recovery meetIng.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.030
Really wanted help

32:46.040 --> 32:48.247
with the unhealthy
relationship that he was in.

32:55.670 --> 33:00.073
Mom, there are things
you don't know

33:00.080 --> 33:01.911
about my life right now,

33:01.920 --> 33:04.036
and I'm willing
to share them someday,

33:04.040 --> 33:05.667
but you need to earn that.

33:07.170 --> 33:08.114
Come,
get a good night sleep.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.917
I need to get back, okay?

33:13.750 --> 33:16.071
I'm gonna stick
around this time.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.115
I promise I'm gonna stay.

33:23.170 --> 33:24.114
Okay.

33:26.830 --> 33:27.990
Okay, Mom.

33:45.710 --> 33:47.109

33:47.120 --> 33:50.032
Yes, I know.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.075
[engine stops]

34:14.120 --> 34:15.951
Ben teach me to drive.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.245
Seriously?

34:18.460 --> 34:19.996
I am a good driver.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.163

34:23.170 --> 34:25.821

-Ech!

35:19.380 --> 35:21.029
Hey! Hey, you can't do that!

35:21.040 --> 35:22.416
You gotta buy it first!

35:22.420 --> 35:24.456
Hey, damn it,
I said leave it be!

Hey!

35:36.210 --> 35:37.950
Out! Now!

35:41.290 --> 35:44.418
We are stronger
than them.

Look, they just--
They had--

36:22.620 --> 36:23.826
They had
too much to drink.

36:23.830 --> 36:24.819
Sorry, man.

36:24.830 --> 36:26.991
This should cover it, right?

36:33.420 --> 36:35.035
No. No, Ryn, she can't go.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.109
That's not safe.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.451
She'll be okay.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.200
It's not her
I'm worried about.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.701
[rock music playing]

36:53.120 --> 36:54.610
It could get ugly, man.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.702
We're not done
with those things.

36:56.710 --> 36:57.825
What?!

36:58.880 --> 36:59.869
That was them?

Out there in the water?

Everything good?

37:05.790 --> 37:07.951
What happened
out there tonight?

37:07.960 --> 37:10.281
Um, it's nothing.

Hello, Helen.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.997
[sighs]
I know why you're here.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.570
It's a lot of money.

37:59.580 --> 38:00.820
What are you planning
on doing with it?

38:00.830 --> 38:02.411
Renovating your shop?

38:02.420 --> 38:04.877
I'll tell you the same thing
I told your husband.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.575
It's none of your business.

38:06.580 --> 38:07.740
Actually, it is.

38:07.750 --> 38:08.956
If you really think
about it,

38:08.960 --> 38:11.872
it's pretty unlikely that you

38:11.880 --> 38:14.030
are related to the Pownalls.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.532
My family has been in this town
a lot longer than you have,

38:17.540 --> 38:21.032
so you're not really qualified
to make such a claim.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.031
The account is mine.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.371
You have no recourse.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.206
I'm quite busy.

38:27.210 --> 38:28.370
Shall I get Scott,

38:28.380 --> 38:31.247
or will you be
exiting on your own?

I think they were all drunk.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.036
I don't know,
they were barefoot,

38:53.040 --> 38:54.871
acting all weird,

38:54.880 --> 38:56.666
seemed like foreigners.

I don't know,
six, seven.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.609
And it was one
of the women

39:03.620 --> 39:04.450
that pushed you
to the ground?

39:04.460 --> 39:05.449
Yep.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.286
All right.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.070
[Eliza, practicing]
Hello.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.241
[Levi] Hello.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.490
Hello.

39:26.540 --> 39:27.416
Hello.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.450
[Levi] Hello.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.495
What?

39:36.500 --> 39:38.286
That look.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.451
[Levi] Hello.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.246
I just wanted
to say, um...

39:43.250 --> 39:44.615
[Levi] Hello.

39:44.620 --> 39:46.417
I know how hard
it's been for you.

39:48.670 --> 39:49.614
Dealing with Ryn
and the song.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.247
[hisses]

39:51.250 --> 39:54.071
I also know you're
trying to get better.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.412
My mom told me about
the support group meeting.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.871
She was there?

40:01.460 --> 40:03.496
Were you there
because of Ryn?

40:05.250 --> 40:07.036
Yeah.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.497
I think it's great
you're working on it.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.240
Means a lot.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.280
[footsteps]

40:21.920 --> 40:23.569
Still hungry.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.207
Never stop eating.

40:26.670 --> 40:28.615
When are you gonna tell her

40:28.620 --> 40:30.201
about what happened
to her mother?

40:30.210 --> 40:32.280
She cannot know this now.

40:33.710 --> 40:36.531
That humans did this.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.417
Or she will not stay on land.

40:40.540 --> 40:41.609
[sighs]

40:48.670 --> 40:50.615
It is a good day.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.663
[hissing breaths]

41:08.790 --> 41:11.076
[hissing breaths]

41:17.420 --> 41:18.489
[hisses]

41:19.880 --> 41:21.495
[grunting]

41:23.790 --> 41:26.873
[hissing]

41:31.670 --> 41:34.321
[placid high-pitched call]

41:37.210 --> 41:39.952
[music playing]
