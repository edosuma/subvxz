WEBVTT

00:06.291 --> 00:08.458
All right, I’m going to jump on this side
of the teeter-totter

00:08.542 --> 00:10.291
and we'll keep going
up and down as long as we can.

00:10.375 --> 00:12.583
Oooh, seesaw!

00:12.667 --> 00:14.083
I want a turn!

00:15.458 --> 00:18.166
Rudy, it's not a seesaw.
It's an extreme teeter-totter.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.375
Extreme teeter-totter! I want a turn!

00:21.458 --> 00:23.458
Rudy, this isn't a toy.

00:23.542 --> 00:26.959
It's the same piece of equipment
famous daredevil Spanky Danger uses.

00:27.041 --> 00:29.458
Yeah, we have tickets to go see him
at the Civic Center this weekend.

00:29.542 --> 00:32.750
Oh, you know, my favorite stuntman
was Johnny Hazard.

00:32.834 --> 00:35.959
His famous stunt was being catapulted
across Mt. Rushmore.

00:36.041 --> 00:37.625
- Did he make it?
- Nope.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.917
He went in Washington's ear
and out Lincoln's nose.

00:40.959 --> 00:43.500
After that he was known
as the human snot rocket.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.208
- Oh yeah, the snot rocket.
- I love that guy.

00:46.291 --> 00:47.500
Yeah.

00:48.792 --> 00:50.709
All right, Jack.
Let's get our teeter-totter on.

00:50.792 --> 00:51.834
Let's do it.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.542
Where are you going?

01:18.625 --> 01:21.959
- To get you a sandwich.
-

01:22.041 --> 01:24.458
For the last time, no!

01:25.333 --> 01:27.750
Will someone please tell your friend
I’m not going to go out with him?

01:27.834 --> 01:29.041
We've told him.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.750
Jerry, you are just a player.

01:31.834 --> 01:34.875
In fact, you've been rejected
by every single girl in Seaford.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.750
I have not. Oh, yo, Carly.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.750
- You wanna go out?
-

01:40.834 --> 01:42.166
Wha--

01:42.250 --> 01:44.375
- Okay, now I have.
- I have to go.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.458
I’m going to be late for my volunteer job
at the aquarium.

01:48.959 --> 01:50.417
Dude, I don't get it.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.709
I get rejected by girls
all the time and it doesn't bother me.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.208
Why does this one hurt so much?

01:56.709 --> 01:58.375
Because you actually like her.

01:59.583 --> 02:01.125
You guys might not believe this,

02:01.208 --> 02:03.750
but old Rudy has felt
the occasional sting of rejection.

02:03.834 --> 02:05.458
- Oh no, I believe it.
- I totally believe it.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.667
- Pretty believable.
- Okay, all right, okay.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.083
Look, my point is

02:10.166 --> 02:12.291
whenever I feel rejected
I just look for something

02:12.375 --> 02:14.709
to take my mind off it,
you know, cheer me up.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.917
Like Milton and Jack's stunt.
This is the perfect distraction.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.583
What? You think their stupid
circus act is going to cheer me up?

02:32.709 --> 02:34.625
-
- Whoo-hoo!

02:34.709 --> 02:37.125
Dude, I was wrong.
That totally cheered me up!

02:37.208 --> 02:38.333
Whoo!

Dude, Milton, check it out!
It's Spanky Danger!

03:22.750 --> 03:24.583
- How do you know?
- Oh, I don't know, maybe it's

03:24.667 --> 03:26.834
the red, white, and blue
jumpsuit with "Spanky" written on it.

03:28.542 --> 03:32.667
Ooh, it is such an honor
to meet you, Spanky.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.875
I can't believe you're here.

03:33.959 --> 03:37.083
Oh, I love coming out,
mixing it up with my fans.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.375
Tell everybody about the jump
you made in las Vegas.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.792
Whew, that was a big jump.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.083
Two years ago,
wind was blowing in my face.

03:45.709 --> 03:46.959
I opened up the throttle and--

03:47.041 --> 03:49.834
And hit that ramp at over
200 miles per hour

03:49.917 --> 03:53.417
and flew over 35 buses.
Go ahead, tell them, tell them!

03:53.875 --> 03:55.500
Well, you just did.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.834
Sorry.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.625
What he didn't say

03:59.709 --> 04:01.834
was that I overshot the ramp.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.834
Broke 215 bones.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.625
No disrespect, Mr. Spanky,

04:07.709 --> 04:11.291
but, uh, human body only has 206 bones.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.250
Didn't say they were all mine.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.458
I landed on a big gal holding a pug.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.417
Hey, we are huge fans.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.834
Earlier we were even trying
your extreme teeter-totter trick.

04:21.917 --> 04:25.291
- Oh, how'd it go?
- Ugh, not good.

04:25.417 --> 04:28.208
I landed in the giant bra
on top of bra barn.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.875
I don't care what their motto is.

04:29.959 --> 04:32.083
It was not "an uplifting experience."

04:33.709 --> 04:35.291
Oh, hey, Spanky,

04:35.834 --> 04:38.041
- can we get your autograph?
- Sure, absolutely.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.083
Whoa, dude, that thumb's pretty gnarly.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.959
Yeah, I took a spill in Iowa.

04:45.041 --> 04:47.875
Couldn't find a doctor so they took me
to a veterinarian.

04:47.959 --> 04:51.041
Didn't save the thumb,
but got me a cow udder.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.125
Sorry about that.
I wasn't milked this morning.

04:57.834 --> 04:59.667
Hey, we've got tickets to your show.

04:59.750 --> 05:00.875
All right, let me see these.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.458
Oh, I’ll get you daredevils
better seats than these.

05:03.542 --> 05:04.959
How do I get 'em to you?

05:05.041 --> 05:06.959
We actually work at the dojo
across the courtyard.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.750
You'll see the giant
teeter-totter out front.

05:08.834 --> 05:11.458
Oh, no, no, no, you can't
leave that out there.

05:11.542 --> 05:14.583
There's always some yahoo
pretending he's a stuntman.

05:14.667 --> 05:15.959
<i>Go ahead, ma!</i>

05:16.041 --> 05:18.875

05:23.500 --> 05:25.000
I tell you this,

05:25.500 --> 05:27.917
my mom's a lot heavier than she looks.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.458
<i>♪ Lunchtime! ♪</i>

05:34.542 --> 05:37.375
I’m having pizza and you guys are...

05:38.208 --> 05:39.709
Having sardines.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.792
Wow, this is really good.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.709
Jerry, what are you doing here?

05:51.792 --> 05:54.083
Not eating sardines.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.166
Look, I know what you're doing.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.750
You became a volunteer
to try to get me to like you.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.667
How dare you?

06:02.750 --> 06:05.041
You know, I became
a volunteer because I share

06:05.125 --> 06:07.583
both a very real
and a very deep connection

06:07.667 --> 06:08.750
with these penguins.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.166
- Pelicans.
- Pelicans.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.667
Well, don't get too attached.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.959
Harold and Maude aren't going
to be here for much longer.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.125
With all the money they spent
on the new bull shark tank,

06:17.208 --> 06:19.375
the aquarium can't afford
the pelican habitat.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.959
They're sending him to Texas
and her to New Jersey.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.667
Aw, that's the saddest thing
I’ve ever heard...

06:25.750 --> 06:27.041
New Jersey.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.750
You know they've been mates
for seven years?

06:30.834 --> 06:32.834
And it shows. Before you came in,

06:32.917 --> 06:34.959
Maude was hungry, Harold went over to her

06:35.041 --> 06:37.667
and yakked up fish guts right in her face.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.250
That's love, man.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.709
You, uh,

06:44.750 --> 06:46.166
look a little hungry.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.583
Sardine?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.959
Ew, what is that smell?

06:59.041 --> 07:01.166
It's like a combination of dead fish,

07:01.250 --> 07:03.500
seagull poop and low tide.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.792
Jerry's socks.

07:09.291 --> 07:11.083
Jerry, what is going on in here?

07:11.166 --> 07:12.583
Dude!

07:12.667 --> 07:15.709
You set up a kiddie pool
in my dojo without asking?

07:16.375 --> 07:18.083
Pool party!

07:19.792 --> 07:21.208
Jerry, there you are.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.834
You bird-napped the pelicans
from the aquarium?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.041
I didn't bird-nap them.
I just blindfolded them

07:26.125 --> 07:27.917
and took them against
their will to a hideout...

07:28.000 --> 07:29.750
Oh, no, yeah, I kinda bird-napped them.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.625
It takes more than a kiddie pool
and a bucket full of sar...

07:33.667 --> 07:35.917
Why is this bucket
filled with donut holes?

07:36.667 --> 07:38.625
Are pelicans not
supposed to eat donut holes?

07:38.709 --> 07:40.917
- No, they are not.
- These donut holes are Jack's.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.625
I’m going to get the pelican handler.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.709
Well, I guess I’m a bad guy for caring.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.291
- Wha...
-

07:49.417 --> 07:51.125
Oh, don't worry.
Mommy and daddy are just having

07:51.208 --> 07:52.834
a little disagreement.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.750
Hey, boys. I got those tickets for ya.

07:56.834 --> 07:57.917
- Great.
- Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.250
Whoa! Okay, tell me.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.041
I wrecked my bike a bunch of times

08:03.125 --> 08:05.375
and sometimes I get a little fuzzy,
you know?

08:05.458 --> 08:07.792
But are there two pelicans in here?

08:07.875 --> 08:09.375
Yeah.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.750
And is that a moose
climbing up a rock wall?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.792
Uh... Yeah sure. Yeah, why not?

08:18.291 --> 08:19.792
I’m just messing with you.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.750
I know it's not a moose.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.625
That's an elk, right?

08:24.834 --> 08:27.875
Whoa! These tickets are in the VIP box!

08:27.959 --> 08:29.166
Spanky, this is so cool.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.291
People are paying hundreds
of dollars for these.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.166
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait, that's it.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.083
Yo, Spanky, my name's Jerry.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.709
I’m a volunteer at the Seaford aquarium.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.709
Look, these pelicans
are supposed to be mates for life,

08:38.792 --> 08:41.458
- but they're getting separated.
- Whew, I’ve been there.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.875
She's gonna take him
for every sardine he's got.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.709
No, no, no, they're being separated

08:46.792 --> 08:48.417
because the aquarium ran out of funding.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.834
He's going to Texas
and she's going to New Jersey.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.625
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.000
Jersey!

08:55.917 --> 08:58.834
Hey, if you could do some sort
of fundraiser at the aquarium,

08:58.917 --> 09:00.709
we could make enough money
to keep them together.

09:00.792 --> 09:01.875
That's a great idea.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.500
Let me think on it for a second.
Got it, okay!

09:04.583 --> 09:07.417
What if I walk the high wire tightrope

09:07.500 --> 09:08.917
over at the aquarium?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.625
But it has to be over something scary.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.500
Ah, how about the men's room

09:13.583 --> 09:15.208
next to the all-you-can-eat clam bar?

09:15.291 --> 09:16.917
Ouch.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.834
Yeah, I don't think I’m ready
for that one.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.625
What about the tank of bull sharks?

09:20.709 --> 09:22.000
That's great!

09:22.208 --> 09:24.500
There is nothing more
important to Spanky Danger

09:24.583 --> 09:27.542
- than everlasting love.
-

09:27.625 --> 09:30.959
Oh, hold on, it's the wife number six.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.750
Ignore.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.959
Yo, Spanky, I can't thank you enough, man!

09:41.834 --> 09:43.417
Uh, Rudy...

09:43.458 --> 09:44.834
Rudy, I wouldn't do that.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.125
Oh please, birds love me.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.208
That bird

09:56.291 --> 09:58.291
does not love me.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.834

10:04.917 --> 10:09.250
You know, guys, I’m a lot like Spanky.
I was born a stuntman.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.208
- You were born a stuntman?
- Yes, I was, Milton.

10:12.291 --> 10:15.917
My father is Hector Martinez.
My mother is Catherine Stuntman.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.709
Okay, you may have the name, Jerry,

10:17.792 --> 10:19.792
but there's not one stunt Spanky does

10:19.875 --> 10:21.709
- that you could actually do.
-

10:21.792 --> 10:25.583
Oh, please, I could ride
Spanky's rocket bike.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.667
I mean, the only difference
between that bike and mine

10:27.750 --> 10:30.709
is it's powered by rockets
and it doesn't have training wheels on it.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.208
Spanky, Spanky, Spanky!

10:42.375 --> 10:46.208
Who's ready for some rocket boots?

10:48.583 --> 10:51.750
I was going to launch myself
100 feet in the air

10:51.834 --> 10:54.125
into that cargo net over there.

10:54.208 --> 10:57.625
Or I could put some nitro in my boots

10:57.709 --> 11:01.750
and go 200 feet in the air.
What do you say, people?

11:01.834 --> 11:05.000
Nitro, nitro, nitro!

11:05.083 --> 11:06.417
Nitro it is!

11:38.250 --> 11:39.959
Hey, where did Jerry go?

11:42.667 --> 11:43.667
Uh-oh.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.250
I’ll show you who can't ride
a rocket bike, Jack!

11:55.583 --> 11:57.375
If that's Spanky...

11:57.458 --> 11:59.458
then that guy's a stunt double.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.583
Spanky's a fake!

12:23.125 --> 12:25.709
I can't believe that angry mob
followed us all the way here.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.834
How did they even know it was me?

12:27.917 --> 12:29.625
I don't know. Maybe it was your jacket?

12:32.208 --> 12:34.542
I forgot to turn my Jacket off.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.709
Spanky, how could you do this?

12:36.792 --> 12:39.041
You think I’m proud of what I’ve become?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.834
Fourteen years ago, New Orleans--

12:41.917 --> 12:43.542
Spanky was attempting to break

12:43.625 --> 12:46.792
the world record
for jumping a car over 200 feet...

12:47.792 --> 12:49.792
I’m going to let you finish this one.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.500
The jump was perfect...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.709
- until the landing.
- Oh.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.750
It's always the landing.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.166
When the smoke cleared,

13:01.250 --> 13:02.667
my body was so mangled

13:02.750 --> 13:04.750
they couldn't tell what was me

13:04.834 --> 13:06.834
and what was my car.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.959
I spent three weeks in a hospital,

13:10.041 --> 13:12.458
five days in a muffler shop.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.083
So that's how you lost your courage?

13:15.166 --> 13:16.375
Yeah.

13:16.834 --> 13:18.291
And gained a radio.

13:25.834 --> 13:28.166
Spanky, you can't live
the rest of your life

13:28.250 --> 13:30.083
hiding behind stunt doubles.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.166
Well, I’m not going to have to any more.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.875
Because of what happened,
the whole world's gonna know who I am...

13:34.959 --> 13:36.667
A fraud!

13:36.750 --> 13:39.291
You know what, Spanky? A hero of mine

13:39.375 --> 13:43.500
once told me that the only thing to fear
is the fear of not trying.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.625
You know who said that?

13:44.709 --> 13:46.208
- Abraham Lincoln?
- Captain Kirk?

13:46.291 --> 13:47.792
Cher?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.875
It actually was Cher.

13:51.709 --> 13:54.458
But the point is that
it could have easily been you, Spanky.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.792
I’m sorry, Cher is your hero?

13:56.875 --> 14:00.875
Cher's everybody's hero, Jack.
The woman's a ding-danged icon.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.542
Come on, Spanky.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Dude, there's two little pelicans
who are counting on you.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.417
You know what?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.208
You're right.

14:11.709 --> 14:15.333
What you guys said
I needed to hear a long time ago.

14:15.417 --> 14:17.125
I’m done hiding.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.834
Tomorrow at that fundraiser,
the whole world's gonna know

14:20.917 --> 14:22.750
Spanky's back!

14:26.834 --> 14:28.458
Dude, you might need a little bit of a...

14:28.542 --> 14:30.333
Tune-up.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.750
- <i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>
-

14:35.875 --> 14:38.333
This is the last picture
I’ll have of you guys together.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.917
But I want you to know that
I will keep it forever.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.625
-
- Or you can keep it forever.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.500
I can't believe you guys
are leaving tomorrow.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.375
I’m really going to miss you guys.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.750
-
- But do you know what hurts the most?

14:59.125 --> 15:01.792
I didn't get phone insurance.

15:06.083 --> 15:09.583
- Taylor, there you are.
-

15:11.583 --> 15:13.792
Wow, for such a pretty girl,
you're an ugly crier.

15:15.458 --> 15:16.333
Yo, I’ve got great news.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.041
I have a way that we can
save the pelicans.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.166
Let me guess, put little tuxedoes on them

15:21.250 --> 15:22.875
and try to blend them in
with the penguins?

15:22.959 --> 15:25.166
No, no, no, I got spa...
That's a great idea.

15:26.291 --> 15:27.792
I think mine's better though.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.208
I got Spanky Danger to do
the fundraiser again!

15:30.291 --> 15:31.792
Jerry, that's amazing!

15:31.875 --> 15:33.667
- We're gonna save the pelicans!
- Yeah.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.542
I’m sorry.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.000
I, I don't know what I was thinking.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.959
No, no, no, no, don't overthink it,
just do it again!

15:42.041 --> 15:44.208
Why? Because we're saving the pelicans!

15:54.333 --> 15:56.417
I cannot believe how many people showed up

15:56.500 --> 15:58.625
to watch Spanky tightrope
over a pool of sharks.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.000
Yeah, it's a comeback story.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.000
Everybody loves
seeing a man rise above his fears.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.834
They're also down with watching sharks
eat a dude.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.291
Thank you all
for coming down to the aquarium.

16:15.417 --> 16:19.750
I guess that explains
why you're all packed in like sardines.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.333
Nope?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.375
This fundraiser is about
saving Harold and Maude.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.667
Some people said that we couldn't do it,

16:30.750 --> 16:34.667
but tonight I say we peli-can.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.041
Seriously? Nothing?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.959
Show's gonna start in a minute!

16:45.875 --> 16:48.375
Sheesh, they're a bad audience.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.917
Yeah. They're the problem.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.792
Yo, where is Spanky?
He should be here by now.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.792
Oh, don't worry.
I just got a text from him.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.792
"Hey guys, you're the best.
Thanks for the pep talk.

17:00.875 --> 17:04.083
By the way, still scared,
not coming. Sorry, Spanky."

17:04.166 --> 17:05.959
If the crowd doesn't see this stunt,

17:06.041 --> 17:07.458
they're going to want their money back.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.834
Which means there'll be
no saving of the pelicans.

17:09.917 --> 17:12.834
Oh, but I just told everybody
that we peli-can!

17:12.917 --> 17:14.291
Milton!

17:15.417 --> 17:18.500
Guys, it's over. We have
to give the crowd their money back.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.500
Who's that?

17:23.583 --> 17:25.667
It's Jerry!

17:27.792 --> 17:29.166
What is he doing up there?

17:29.250 --> 17:31.417
I think he's gonna try
to walk the tightrope.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.834
He would never try to walk...

17:32.917 --> 17:34.792
I’m going to try and walk the tightrope!

17:36.417 --> 17:39.709
I know you all came here
to see a death-defying stunt,

17:39.792 --> 17:42.709
and I, Jerry Martinez,

17:42.792 --> 17:45.208
am going to give it to you!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.750
Come on, Seaford,

17:49.834 --> 17:51.458
show me some love!

17:51.542 --> 17:54.959
Fall, Jerry, fall! Fall, Jerry, fall!

17:55.041 --> 17:57.250
That's not really love!

18:14.291 --> 18:16.125
Okay, oooh.

18:20.291 --> 18:23.542
Hey, I can actually do this.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.583
- Whoa.
-

18:38.667 --> 18:40.250
Oh, no, I can't do this.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.875
Can't do this. Gotta go back.

18:42.667 --> 18:45.583
- Whoa! Whoa!
-

18:47.875 --> 18:49.750
No worries! I’m okay.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.208
Wow, this is a much better way
to use this thing.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.500
Oh, no, bad shark! Don't bite!

19:06.000 --> 19:09.667
- Jerry, hang on!
- Oh, great advice. Thanks, hon!

19:17.417 --> 19:18.625
All right, Jerry,

19:18.709 --> 19:19.959
Jerry, give me your hand.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.750
I can't, Jack! I can't.

19:25.417 --> 19:26.625
-
- Wait... All right.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, that works, okay.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.625
- Okay, okay. All right, all right.
-

19:37.709 --> 19:39.125
Okay, all right, all right.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.125
- Jerry, I can't see!
- Oh, you're lucky

19:41.208 --> 19:43.625
- 'cause it's really scary up here, man!
- Move your hands!

19:43.709 --> 19:45.625
- Oh, sorry.
- Thank you!

19:46.625 --> 19:48.542
Okay, all right. We can do this.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.542
So close, so close. So close.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.125
Wah, mommy.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.083
-
- Oh!

20:06.083 --> 20:09.625
You guys did it. The crowd loved it.
You saved the pelicans!

20:11.959 --> 20:14.375
Jerry, I cannot believe
you were going to risk your life

20:14.458 --> 20:16.041
to save Harold and Maude.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.750
I was wrong about you.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.500
Where are you going?

20:26.583 --> 20:28.583
Oh, I thought I'd take a quick swim.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.083
Rudy, I don't think that's a good idea.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.959
Oh, please, sharks love me.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.917
These sharks do not love me!

20:48.000 --> 20:51.333
-
- So movies?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.917
- Let's do it.
-

20:54.875 --> 20:56.500
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

21:01.792 --> 21:04.083
I still can't believe
that Spanky backed out.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.625
I thought we helped him
get his courage back.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.083
I wondered what changed his mind?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.709
So you don't think I should do it?

21:10.792 --> 21:12.709
No, I do not.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.125
Dude, you're one-third motorcycle,
you broke every bone in your body,

21:16.208 --> 21:18.667
- and you have an udder for a thumb.
- You're right.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.458
Hey, you want some milk for your coffee?

21:22.125 --> 21:23.542
Just a little bit.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.041
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.583 --> 22:02.709
<i>Yes!</i>
