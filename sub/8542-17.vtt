00:02.437 --> 00:04.221
Matilda Cruz was 23.

00:04.308 --> 00:05.918
She'd been missing for two weeks

00:06.006 --> 00:09.357
when her body was found
at a county waste facility.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.837
We believe that Matilda
met her killer online

00:11.924 --> 00:14.884
in a chat room dedicated
to lovers of Shakespeare.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.365
We would ask anybody
who uses that chat room

00:17.452 --> 00:20.585
or similar sites
to please contact the CBI

00:20.672 --> 00:23.980
if they come across
any suspicious activity online.

00:24.067 --> 00:27.114
And now Gary Philo,
CEO Of Phiz Systems

00:27.201 --> 00:30.247
and Matilda's boss,
would like to say a few words.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.120
[camera shutters clicking]

00:33.207 --> 00:35.557
Thank you.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.472
I'll be brief.

00:37.559 --> 00:42.303
Matilda Cruz
was a beautiful young soul..

00:42.390 --> 00:46.916
...and a treasured member
of our family here at Phiz.

00:47.003 --> 00:50.659
And that is why
I am offering $10 million..

00:50.746 --> 00:54.315
...for information leading
to the arrest of her killer.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.796
Matilda deserves justice,
and she will get it.

00:57.883 --> 00:58.841
Questions?

00:58.928 --> 01:00.147
Wainright needs us.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.757
Super urgent.
He won't say why.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.237
Interesting,
but I can't go yet.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.325
It's a press conference.
Let's go.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.630
I need one minute.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.111
Naturally, we are
all deeply upset

01:08.198 --> 01:09.982
'and saddened at this tragedy.'

01:10.070 --> 01:11.941
We will get through this.

01:12.028 --> 01:15.075
'We will come back
stronger than ever.'

01:15.162 --> 01:17.338
For Matilda's sake.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.949
Mr. Philo uh, Gary,

01:20.036 --> 01:23.735
what was your personal
impression of Matilda Cruz?

01:23.822 --> 01:25.346
[clears throat]

01:25.433 --> 01:28.349
Well, as with all our employees

01:28.436 --> 01:31.743
she and I had a nice chat
when she first joined us

01:31.830 --> 01:34.311
but beyond that, I never
had the privilege

01:34.398 --> 01:36.052
of getting to
know her personally.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.141
- Come on. Let's go.
- I have 30 more seconds.

01:38.228 --> 01:41.101
Sir, you're a-a famously
thrifty man, aren't you?

01:41.188 --> 01:45.844
Uh, the no-brand sneakers
the compact cars, all that.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.892
Excuse me, I don't mean
to be authoritarian--

01:49.979 --> 01:52.329
Then don't be. We're
investigating a murder here.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.592
Are you thrifty or not?

01:54.679 --> 01:58.205
What in the devil does my
thrift have to do with...that?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.294
Ah. You notice
that tiny little beat

02:00.381 --> 02:01.947
you took before you said "that"?

02:02.034 --> 02:04.646
That, my friend,
was a solid-gold tell.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.518
- What?
- Never mind. You're thrifty.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.607
You're a legendary
cheapskate, in fact.

02:09.694 --> 02:13.133
And yet, you put up $10 million
of your own precious money

02:13.220 --> 02:15.570
to find Matilda's killer.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.919
Why would you do that?

02:17.006 --> 02:19.356
Why?
Because you know for sure

02:19.443 --> 02:21.793
you'll never pay
one single penny of that money

02:21.880 --> 02:23.186
because it's you.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.622
You're Matilda's killer.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.190
Ooh! Aah!

02:27.277 --> 02:30.846
Uh, that's assault.
Lisbon, arrest him!

02:30.933 --> 02:32.195
Stay there.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.806
[theme music]

02:44.686 --> 02:47.123
Ah. Thank you for
getting in here so promptly.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.343
The FBI needs our help.
Agent Darcy.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.040
We just caught a homicide

02:51.127 --> 02:53.564
where the family of the
victim has statehouse juice.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.045
The lieutenant governor has
specifically requested you

02:56.132 --> 02:58.352
for the task force.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.049
He wants the best
on this one, he says.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.703
Whoa. Well, I'm flattered.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.618
Uh, but we already have a case.
A big case.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.794
Yes. So I've heard.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.798
We don't need the team.
Just Jane.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.539
That is, of course,
if you're willing.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.889
Well, I'm...happy to help

03:13.976 --> 03:16.239
I just-as long as
it's okay with you.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.545
'Cause last we spoke,
we weren't exactly

03:17.632 --> 03:19.329
seeing things eye to eye.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.678
The Red John case, you mean.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.724
Yes, it is a mystery, isn't it?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.465
It's not surprising
we have different takes

03:24.552 --> 03:27.903
but that doesn't mean we can't
work together, does it?

03:27.990 --> 03:29.905
Excellent.
It's all settled then.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.997
I know what you're gonna say.
You're gonna warn me

03:35.084 --> 03:37.304
that Agent Darcy's
playing games with me.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.045
She's trying to investigate me
on the sly, bless her heart.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.699
Well, yes, exactly.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.353
Well, I play games
better than she does

03:43.440 --> 03:44.528
so I'm looking forward to it.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.487
Oh, so you get to go
off and have fun

03:46.574 --> 03:48.967
while we deal with
the Philo mess you've left us?

03:49.054 --> 03:51.709
- I'm pretty sure he's guilty.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.494
I'd love to stick around
and help you solve this crime

03:53.581 --> 03:55.844
but I can't really
say "no" to the FBI.

03:55.931 --> 03:56.932
You know, Darcy
would leave you alone

03:57.019 --> 03:58.238
if you just told
her the truth.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.587
Which truth
you are talking about?

03:59.674 --> 04:00.849
That you didn't kill Red John

04:00.936 --> 04:01.980
that you lied about it

04:02.067 --> 04:03.243
that you did a lot of stupid

04:03.330 --> 04:05.157
things to cover up the lies

04:05.245 --> 04:08.073
and that now he's back, and
you're very sorry, that truth.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.510
- Eh.
- Can't you see.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.076
Your stubborn arrogance is gonna

04:11.163 --> 04:13.514
bite you in the...Agent Darcy.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.993
We gotta get rolling,
they're keeping

04:15.080 --> 04:16.560
the crime scene intact
until we get there.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.953
Okay. I'm ready.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.433
Thanks for lending him to me.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.392
My pleasure.
Glad to see the back of him.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.872
Oh, okay.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.091
- Well, bye.
- Bye. Just go and have fun.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.747
I'm gonna have a great time.
There's my back. See you.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.230
[sighs]

04:34.317 --> 04:35.536
Hey, boss.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.190
Philo's lawyer's arrived
he wants to talk.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.975
What are you gonna do?

04:40.062 --> 04:42.194
Probably gonna
have to let him go.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.370
[sighs]

04:46.068 --> 04:47.548
Ah.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.158
Here she is.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.595
This is the fool
that arrested me.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.380
I am sorry, sir. I under--

04:53.467 --> 04:56.252
I want this little bitch
toasted like a marshmallow.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.993
You'll excuse
my client's anger.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.777
He has every reason
to feel aggrieved.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.692
'His arrest was
an outrageous abuse of power'

05:01.779 --> 05:04.173
I will be brief, counselor..

05:04.260 --> 05:05.783
...You committed an assault.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.438
We can hold you for 48 hours
without charging you

05:08.525 --> 05:10.310
and we will hold you
for those 48 hours.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.790
Unless, of course you would like

05:12.877 --> 05:15.445
to confess
to the murder of Matilda Cruz

05:15.532 --> 05:17.317
in which case, things would
move a lot more quickly.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.666
Agent Lisbon, this is no way

05:18.753 --> 05:19.710
to treat a man
of Mr. Philo's stand--

05:19.797 --> 05:22.583
'Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.'

05:22.670 --> 05:23.714
She can legally
hold me that long?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.542
Yes, but that doesn't mean--

05:25.629 --> 05:28.458
Don't waste your breath.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.765
[sighs]
You may go.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.114
What?

05:32.201 --> 05:33.550
I'm not gonna pay you $1,000

05:33.637 --> 05:35.900
to hold my hand
while this idiotic girl

05:35.987 --> 05:38.816
acts out her hatred of powerful
father figures. Just go!

05:41.297 --> 05:43.343
As you wish, Mr. Philo.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.085
Yeah.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.437
[telephone ringing]

06:01.448 --> 06:03.885
That creep is a
psychopath, and he's guilty

06:03.972 --> 06:05.452
and we are gonna
make him say so.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.497
He cracked once already
when he hit Jane.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.151
Let's make him crack again.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.458
Okay.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.989
[Darcy]
'Victim was found
early this morning'

06:21.076 --> 06:22.860
'by state park rangers.'

06:22.947 --> 06:27.169
'Victim's name is Kati Bauer.
27, married, one child.'

06:28.866 --> 06:31.303
Multiple stab wounds.
Uh, evidence of sexual assault.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.134
Lieutenant Franklin, is this
exactly how you found the body?

06:36.221 --> 06:38.572
[sighs]
Yes, ma'am. I..

06:38.659 --> 06:41.444
...I-I noticed her car
parked off the road.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.099
It looked like it had
been there overnight, so..

06:44.186 --> 06:47.668
...so I and a couple of my men
took a look around and..

06:47.755 --> 06:49.974
...found the poor woman here.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.846
She looks peaceful.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.153
No signs of struggle.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.513
No defense wounds.

07:12.606 --> 07:13.955
Do you know her?

07:14.042 --> 07:15.609
Was she a local girl?

07:15.696 --> 07:19.526
Uh, Santa Carla,
in the valley, but, uh, no.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.920
No, I didn't know her.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.314
This..

07:25.401 --> 07:29.144
...you see, this
is my first homicide.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.407
Just, it's-it's sad.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.452
Mm.

07:46.727 --> 07:47.641
Wine.

07:48.946 --> 07:49.860
[female #1]
'Wine?'

07:49.947 --> 07:51.383
Wine?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.560
Why is that...Kati, would
drink wine on occasion.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.604
Why is that relevant?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.258
Well, it's probably not.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.086
Um, I'm sorry.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.437
I wasn't listening earlier.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.179
You're her in-laws,
you're not her parents

08:04.266 --> 08:06.355
and this is...
this isn't your house?

08:06.442 --> 08:09.619
We live in Pasadena.
This is Sandy and Kati's house.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.578
Sandy is our son,
her husband.

08:11.665 --> 08:15.103
He's on his way home now
from our New York offices.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.713
When did you last see Kati?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.368
Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m.

08:19.455 --> 08:22.676
We came to take Megan to our
house for the day and give Kati

08:22.763 --> 08:24.155
a little "me" time.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.768
It's a regular thing
we do.

08:27.855 --> 08:31.336
What does Kati like to do
during her "me" time?

08:31.423 --> 08:32.381
'You know,
I think she just likes'

08:32.468 --> 08:33.861
'to give the help the day off'

08:33.948 --> 08:36.124
and enjoys the solitude
and the peace and quiet.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.781
[Darcy]
'And when did you return here?'

08:40.868 --> 08:43.827
Well, it's all a blur, but it
must have been just before 5:00

08:43.914 --> 08:47.614
because I...do my insulin
shot regularly at that time

08:47.701 --> 08:52.532
and I had to hurry
in order to...do it.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.446
And she was gone.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.927
[beeps]

08:58.712 --> 09:01.453
We waited for two hours
and then we called the police.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.852
Did Kati like to
go up to the mountains a lot?

09:08.939 --> 09:10.375
No.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.900
I mean,
perhaps with Sandy, but..

09:12.987 --> 09:15.859
'...on her own, on a whim, no.'

09:15.946 --> 09:18.427
Kati was very much
a creature of habit.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.473
[cell phone rings]

09:21.561 --> 09:23.475
Oh. It's the house phone.
That's odd.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.044
Sorry. That's-that's me.
I just, uh...I like to fiddle.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.482
Don't mind me. Carry on.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.662
- So, Mrs. Bauer, you were say--
- '"New York offices," huh?'

09:35.749 --> 09:38.360
What business
are you and your son in?

09:38.447 --> 09:41.363
We are a design consultancy
for the financial--

09:41.450 --> 09:43.670
Hi. Uh, what kind of
place do you have there?

09:44.888 --> 09:45.976
Uh-huh.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.978
Ah. Oh, interesting. Okay.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.025
No, no, no, no.
Thank you. Bye.

[instrumental music]

10:26.408 --> 10:28.802
[music continues]

10:33.633 --> 10:36.418
Only two outgoing calls
on the landline yesterday

10:36.505 --> 10:38.855
one to you, Shirley--
may I call you "Shirley"?

10:38.942 --> 10:41.336
'At around 8:15 in the morning'

10:41.423 --> 10:45.732
and one call to
Mama Sylvia's pizzeria, 12:07.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.778
Which is strange 'cause
there's no pizza box here.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.475
Well, maybe it was a misdial.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.739
Of course.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.002
Probably is that.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.787
A misdial.

10:57.874 --> 10:58.832
[door closes]

10:58.919 --> 11:00.355
[Male #1]
'Hello?'

11:00.442 --> 11:01.399
Oh.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.103
Ah, it's just a feeling.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.801
Can't really put
my finger on it.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.935
- I disagree.
- Hmm. Okay.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.502
Case closed, then.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.242
Lovely working with you.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.548
Wait a minute.
The case isn't closed.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.115
We have to wait for
the blood and DNA.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.551
We've gotta
get this right.

22:15.638 --> 22:18.119
Lieutenant governor's
watching it very closely.

22:20.948 --> 22:21.992
The lieutenant governor
doesn't give

22:22.079 --> 22:23.559
a damn about this case.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.344
Quit fooling.
What's the real story here?

22:25.431 --> 22:29.130
Why do you want me
on this case so badly?

22:29.217 --> 22:33.221
Okay. You're right. I lied.

22:33.308 --> 22:38.008
I asked for you on the case
because I need your help.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.227
My job's in jeopardy.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.577
It's...you know,
it's office politics.

22:41.664 --> 22:42.926
I need a win.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.711
But you have a win.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.930
You're confident
James Barca's guilty?

22:47.017 --> 22:48.062
But you're not.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.933
And what if you're right?

22:51.935 --> 22:54.547
Hey. Help me.
Come on. Please.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.159
Stay.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.640
If I stay and I'm right..

23:00.727 --> 23:02.685
...we run this case my way.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.730
I'm here to learn.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.428
[chuckles]

23:06.515 --> 23:08.648
Then I'll stay.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.663
Do you recognize
this item?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.360
No.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.884
Are you sure?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.016
Take a closer look.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.107
- I'm sure.
- No.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.109
Take a really good look.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.722
[sighs]

23:39.809 --> 23:41.724
It's a beautiful
object, isn't it?

23:41.811 --> 23:44.423
- Hmm. Suppose so.
- Yeah.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.730
Restful to look at.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.645
Very..

23:49.732 --> 23:52.474
...restful.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.912
[sniggers]

23:55.999 --> 23:58.262
Wait.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.135
Are you really
trying to hypnotizeme?

24:01.222 --> 24:02.963
- No.
- Yes, you are.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.965
Just checking to see
if you recognize that.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.098
No.

24:08.185 --> 24:11.014
[Gary]
'You were. You were trying
to hypnotize me.'

24:11.101 --> 24:13.016
No. No, I wasn't.

24:15.497 --> 24:16.411
[Susan]
'Before we were so rudely'

24:16.498 --> 24:18.979
'interrupted by James Barca'

24:19.066 --> 24:21.982
I was asking you
about Red John.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.725
Now? When I have
eggs coming?

24:25.812 --> 24:27.683
Well, I can't help it.
I'm an FBI agent.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.642
I like to get at the truth.

24:29.729 --> 24:30.773
Hmm.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.297
I tell you what.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.822
How about I do an old-school
psychic reading on you

24:35.909 --> 24:37.911
and then we'll talk Red John?

24:37.998 --> 24:39.956
You wanna do your act?

24:40.043 --> 24:42.829
Mm, what can I say?
I'm a showman.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.353
Okay.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.398
Do your reading
and then we'll talk.

24:47.486 --> 24:52.229
You have to be
completely honest with me.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.971
Of course.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.713
Happy childhood?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.063
Yes.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.065
Who was your
favorite, mom or dad?

25:02.152 --> 25:03.371
Dad.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.808
Mom showed weakness,
Dad was stronger?

25:08.071 --> 25:09.072
Yeah, I guess.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.813
Stronger how?

25:10.900 --> 25:14.034
I don't know.
Uh, you know. Life.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.253
No. Something more
specific than that.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.647
Something you..

25:18.734 --> 25:20.301
...can't talk about easily.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.176
You have the
confidence of an only child

25:26.263 --> 25:29.223
yet there's sadness also.

25:34.402 --> 25:37.100
You lost somebody.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.407
Everybody's lost somebody.

25:39.494 --> 25:43.890
Yes, but you lost
a sister or a brother.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.501
- Which?
- Sister.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.198
Drowning. It wasn't
anybody's fault.

25:48.285 --> 25:51.114
You blame yourself,
which you know is crazy.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.814
Oh, wow.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.860
You're good. Huh.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.300
That's a neat skill.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.522
So now let's talk
about Red John.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.307
That's why you're
relentless in your work.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.527
Because you're
relentlessly hard on yourself.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.051
You know, you should
cut yourself some slack.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.487
You'd be a lot happier.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.619
Come on. You don't
know anything--

26:17.706 --> 26:18.925
You're lonely
and you're sad

26:19.012 --> 26:20.491
because you lock
down your emotions

26:20.579 --> 26:21.580
which accounts for your

26:21.667 --> 26:23.712
stilted seduction technique.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.322
You're capable
of great passion

26:25.409 --> 26:27.150
if you'd just
let yourself go.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.674
But you won't

26:28.761 --> 26:30.893
not until you redeem yourself

26:30.980 --> 26:33.287
make the wrong things right.

26:33.374 --> 26:34.810
But how can
you hope to do that?

26:34.897 --> 26:37.117
You can't bring
your sister back.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.989
You're on your own.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.041
Deep down inside,
you're a cruel man, aren't you?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.528
Here you go, hon.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.748
[mug clatters]

27:00.967 --> 27:02.838
Ah.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.108
- Susan, wait.
- Seriously, Patrick.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.719
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, never mind that.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.546
I realized what's
bugging me about this case.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.073
Agents.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.465
Have you charged him?

27:21.552 --> 27:22.945
Charged who?

27:23.032 --> 27:25.078
The man you arrested.
Uh, the pizza guy.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.993
Who told you
we'd arrested anyone?

27:27.080 --> 27:30.866
Ah. Of course.
Ranger Franklin.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.172
- I was told in confidence.
- Well.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.652
Never mind who
we have in custody.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.785
We need to look
through your wife's stuff.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.439
Now.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.223
This is her room.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.269
Separate bedrooms, huh?

27:42.356 --> 27:44.271
If you tell me what you're
looking for maybe I can help.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.012
Ooh, I doubt
that very much.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.317
[baby crying]

27:47.404 --> 27:48.710
Excuse me.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.454
What are you looking for?

27:53.541 --> 27:55.195
Uh.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.632
Kati wasn't wearing
her wedding ring.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.201
Yes. You're right.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.944
Maybe James Barca took it.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.209
He didn't have it, did he?

28:12.168 --> 28:13.474
Maybe he threw it away.

28:13.561 --> 28:17.347
Possibly. But why?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.567
More likely, she
wasn't wearing her ring

28:19.654 --> 28:20.742
because she left it at home.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.091
Because that's what people do

28:22.178 --> 28:23.527
when they're having an affair.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.186
Were you and Kati
having an affair?

28:30.273 --> 28:31.405
Oh, come on.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.494
No, ma'am,
we were not.

28:33.581 --> 28:36.149
Oh, James, don't deny
yourselves the truth.

28:36.236 --> 28:39.630
You and Kati were
in love. Or am I wrong?

28:39.718 --> 28:42.721
Was it just a little...fun?
A little lust?

28:48.901 --> 28:50.119
No.

28:52.034 --> 28:55.734
I loved her.
And she loved me.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.127
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.781
Why didn't you
tell us before?

28:59.868 --> 29:02.131
Tell you that
she was cheating? What for?

29:02.218 --> 29:04.133
'I don't wanna make it seem
like she was a bad person.'

29:04.220 --> 29:05.395
'Give her family more grief.'

29:05.482 --> 29:07.397
Well, that's
very considerate of you.

29:09.617 --> 29:12.098
How long were you together?

29:12.185 --> 29:13.795
Six months.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.060
I delivered a pizza one time,
and we got to talking.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.976
She was..

29:21.063 --> 29:24.153
...lonely, and..

29:24.240 --> 29:26.286
...I don't know,
we got along.

29:28.114 --> 29:31.770
She said we must have been
married in a previous life.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.641
Does anyone else
know about the relationship?

29:33.728 --> 29:36.252
No.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.167
Look, James, if you
can prove you were lovers

29:38.254 --> 29:40.082
you might be able
to avoid the death penalty.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.997
I don't want to avoid it.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.653
I killed her.

29:46.915 --> 29:50.440
See, thing is, James.

29:50.527 --> 29:53.095
I'm about to..

29:53.182 --> 29:55.532
...80% sure that
you didn't kill her.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.409
I wish that were true.

30:02.496 --> 30:03.671
We'll see.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.247
[birds chirping]

30:14.334 --> 30:16.815
I found this
in your wife's bedroom.

30:16.902 --> 30:17.903
Make of it what you will

30:17.990 --> 30:20.644
but Mr. Barca is innocent.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.864
Your wife's killer
is still out there.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.648
But the man
confessed, didn't he?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.955
Well, he's just
a messed-up kid, that's all.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.523
I could kick him myself.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.525
The truth was right there.

30:31.612 --> 30:35.181
I missed it
by a hair. A hair.

30:35.268 --> 30:36.660
Brush aside the distractions

30:36.747 --> 30:39.054
and it's just so obvious.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.621
[Sandy]
'What is?
I don't follow you.'

30:40.708 --> 30:41.796
No need. No need.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.276
Leave it to us professionals.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.974
And rest assured, the true
culprit will pay dearly.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.804
Excuse me.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.111
"The true culprit
will pay dearly"?

30:52.198 --> 30:54.243
That a little
too theatrical for you?

30:54.330 --> 30:55.331
Where are we going now?

30:55.418 --> 30:56.376
Right now we're going back

30:56.463 --> 30:57.812
to the forest service office.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.683
- To do what?
- To release James Barca.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.816
And get a search warrant
for his brother Manny.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.166
Manny Barca is your culprit?
What's his motive?

31:04.253 --> 31:07.430
Well, who knows? Maybe he was
in love with Kati too.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.692
Come on. That's not enough.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.043
Sure, it is.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.960
Jane, it's not enough.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.136
Deal was we run
this case my way.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.486
Well, the deal's off.

31:19.573 --> 31:20.661
We're charging
James Barca as soon as

31:20.748 --> 31:21.836
the blood work gets back.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.882
I'm sick and tired
of your antics.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.100
Kati Bauer deserves
better than these

31:25.187 --> 31:26.841
stupid games you're playing.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.408
Oh, don't talk
to me about games.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.758
And you don't care
a damn about Kati Bauer.

31:30.845 --> 31:35.806
- Nor is your job in jeopardy.
- Excuse me?

31:35.894 --> 31:38.897
I'm only here so you can
get a good close-up look at me.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.290
Why would I want to get
a good, close-up look at you?

31:41.377 --> 31:43.771
You tell me.
And quit your play-acting.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.773
'Cause you're really
not very good at it.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.221
Red John is alive,
and you know it.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.094
Well, that's a theory.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.183
It's a fact.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.012
And the only question is,
why would you deny it?

32:07.099 --> 32:09.579
Why would you try
and throw me off the trail?

32:12.756 --> 32:14.889
I realized something.
You're not hunting Red John.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.282
You're protecting him
and that's why you..

32:16.369 --> 32:17.326
...claim he's dead.

32:17.413 --> 32:18.545
That's absurd.

32:18.632 --> 32:21.113
What other conclusion
could I come to?

32:21.200 --> 32:23.419
If you're enemies,
why hasn't he killed you?

32:23.506 --> 32:24.855
Well..

32:24.943 --> 32:26.422
Why hasn't he killed
the people you work with?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.685
I don't know.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.122
Well, if Red John is dead

32:30.209 --> 32:32.298
why are the people
that cross him still dying?

32:32.385 --> 32:33.908
Because he has friends.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.041
He has disciples.

32:39.566 --> 32:40.610
Are you one of them?

32:40.697 --> 32:42.134
Is that why you're
protecting him?

32:42.221 --> 32:45.006
I wasn't protecting him,
I was protecting you.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.008
No, Susan.
You have this all wrong.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.531
Patrick, how can I
believe a word you say?

32:48.618 --> 32:53.362
You won't even admit
that Red John is alive.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.714
Okay. Fine.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.850
I admit that Red John
is still alive.

33:02.937 --> 33:03.938
Why did you deny it?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.026
It was a mistake.

33:05.113 --> 33:06.071
But I am not his friend

33:06.158 --> 33:08.595
nor am I one of his disciples.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.075
I sure hope
you can prove that.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.381
Well, I don't have
to prove anything.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.688
You do.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.612
Well, I guess we have
nothing more to do here.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.361
[Susan]
'Bye, Patrick.'

33:45.414 --> 33:46.546
[Franklin]
'Mr. Jane.'

33:46.633 --> 33:47.982
Ah, Franklin.

33:48.069 --> 33:51.072
Listen, uh, big news.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.770
We're gonna release James Barca
first thing tomorrow morning.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.511
Agent Darcy's
getting a search warrant

33:55.598 --> 33:57.426
for his brother Manny's
house and car.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.732
Holy cow. Why?

33:58.819 --> 34:00.734
No real evidence yet

34:00.821 --> 34:04.216
but we're certain
that Manny is our man.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.740
You wanna help us
execute the search warrants?

34:06.827 --> 34:08.220
- Sure thing.
- Alright.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.918
I'll call you
first thing in the morning.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.617
Hey, Jane.
How's it going?

34:16.097 --> 34:17.925
- I need your help.
- 'My help?'

34:18.012 --> 34:19.666
- What about Darcy?
- 'Uh.'

34:19.753 --> 34:21.276
It didn't work out.
Long story.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.844
Uh, no big deal. I'll tell
you when you get here.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.846
- I'm busy here!
- 'Call me when you're close.'

34:28.675 --> 34:30.329
I have to go. Jane needs me.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.461
You guys are gonna have to
handle this yourselves.

34:32.548 --> 34:35.464
Uh, okay.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.255
[male #3]
'Here's some water.'

34:43.342 --> 34:45.692
Thank you.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.616
Thank you.

35:08.410 --> 35:11.718
Traces of DNA were found
under Matilda's fingernails.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.765
Ah.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.464
Ah, so nowyou're going
to test my DNA

35:18.551 --> 35:22.076
by sampling the saliva
I left on that bottle, huh?

35:22.163 --> 35:23.469
That drink of water's
gonna be pretty expensive.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.079
You're busted.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.167
Do yourself a favor.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.342
Get out ahead of this.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.039
Talk to us.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.650
Well, these days I imagine

35:30.737 --> 35:33.653
an intelligent killer
will be very careful

35:33.740 --> 35:36.656
not to leave DNA
on his or her victim.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.310
Everybody makes mistakes.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.007
[chuckles]

35:41.704 --> 35:43.489
Not the killer
of Matilda Cruz.

35:46.535 --> 35:49.756
Sweetheart, if you ever
want a sample of my DNA

35:49.843 --> 35:52.193
all you gotta do is ask.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.027
[instrumental music]

36:06.599 --> 36:08.557
[car honks]

36:13.127 --> 36:15.347
Okay. What happened
with Darcy?

36:15.434 --> 36:17.479
Um, you're not gonna
ask about the case?

36:17.566 --> 36:18.567
Is it under control?

36:18.654 --> 36:19.873
Yes. I missed you.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.744
- I missed you, too.
- Hmm.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.833
- So what happened?
- We fell out.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.184
- Did you crack the Philo case?
- No, not yet.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.489
- That's it? You fell out?
- Well.

36:27.576 --> 36:31.319
You don't think
I'd tell you? Can we go?

36:31.406 --> 36:33.756
[engine revs]

36:39.936 --> 36:42.983
Now we wait.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.420
Tell me what
happened with Darcy.

36:45.507 --> 36:46.682
Hmm.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.036
[switch clicks]

36:54.951 --> 36:56.518
I'm still here.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.738
Yes. I know.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.654
Please, Jane.
Just tell me what happened.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.612
Okay.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.527
I admitted that
Red John is still alive

37:05.614 --> 37:07.312
just like you wanted me to

37:07.399 --> 37:10.228
and she accused me
of working for him.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.577
What?

37:11.664 --> 37:13.231
She thinks I'm one of
Red John's disciples.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.450
The FBI thinks you're
working with Red John?

37:15.537 --> 37:16.669
Don't look
so serious.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.453
- It's a joke.
- What did you tell her?

37:18.540 --> 37:20.412
I told her to go
ahead and prove it.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.544
- Oh, my god.
- Well, news flash.

37:22.631 --> 37:23.937
I don't work for Red John

37:24.024 --> 37:25.634
so she's wasting her time.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.071
- What did Darcy use as proof?
- Well, sh...nothing.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.944
How could she have any proof?

37:31.031 --> 37:32.815
I can't believe you
haven't cracked Philo yet.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.296
I mean, you guys just can't
manage without me, can you?

37:35.383 --> 37:37.472
Don't try and divert
me with insults!

37:37.559 --> 37:39.082
Okay, what did she say
she was gonna do?

37:39.169 --> 37:40.693
- She didn't.
- And you didn't ask her?

37:40.780 --> 37:42.260
Ah! Look.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.580
[Jane]
Excuse me.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.278
You're both under arrest!

38:00.365 --> 38:02.932
I'm not sure why, but hey.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.458
[clattering]

38:08.286 --> 38:10.505
You knew Kati was having
an affair with James Barca

38:10.592 --> 38:12.333
but you didn't
tell Sandy because, uh..

38:12.420 --> 38:13.900
...he'd want a divorce.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.555
And in California,
that means that Kati would get

38:16.642 --> 38:20.385
half the assets and joint
custody of Megan, like a reward.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.778
Exactly. A reward
for being a slut.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.693
Hon, I thought
we agreed not to talk

38:24.780 --> 38:25.868
till Josh Wagner gets here.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.914
Alright.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.829
When you saw Kati
preparing that picnic lunch

38:29.916 --> 38:32.310
you knew it was for
her regular date with James.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.224
She made potato salad
right in front of me.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.530
As brazen as can be.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.271
And you used
your insulinneedle

38:37.358 --> 38:39.491
to inject a
powerful sedative

38:39.578 --> 38:41.493
horse tranquilizer, probably

38:41.580 --> 38:44.931
into all of the wine bottles of that wine rack.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.977
So that whichever bottle Kati took

38:48.064 --> 38:49.892
your plan would still work.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.339
[Shirley] It was a good plan.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.001
It was a very good plan.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.221
Then why are we here?

39:14.308 --> 39:16.745
Those tiny holes you left

39:16.832 --> 39:20.619
in the wine bottles on the wine
rack that was your downfall.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.490
That, and the shard
of glass that you left

39:22.577 --> 39:24.927
up at the picnic site.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.364
All I needed to do was plant

39:26.451 --> 39:30.846
the word "hairbrush"
in your subconscious.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.283
And bait a trap
with a fake story

39:33.371 --> 39:36.112
to be passed on
by chatty Cathy here.

39:36.199 --> 39:38.550
Whoa. Hey, look.

39:38.637 --> 39:39.638
I had no idea
that I was passing on a--

39:39.725 --> 39:40.682
I was just teasing.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.554
Relax. It's fine.

39:42.641 --> 39:43.946
You did very well.
You did a great job.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.426
In fact, you cracked
the case for us.

39:45.513 --> 39:48.081
And that is exactly
what my report will reflect.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.170
Congratulations.

39:50.257 --> 39:53.303
Well, that's...thank you.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.696
Well, think nothing of it.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.524
You know, your call.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.744
But perhaps you might wanna
release James Barca now.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.398
I'm sure his family
would appreciate it.

40:02.182 --> 40:05.141
- James.
- Oh, my goodness, brother.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.101
Oh! James!
Are you okay?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.712
That's nice.
You did good.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.105
Hmm.

40:12.192 --> 40:14.629
I'll be right back.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.892
Oh. Time to go.

40:16.979 --> 40:20.026
Nope. Uh, um, okay.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.507
Thank you.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.986
Yep.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.118
Thank you.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.598
Yep.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.341
Agent Darcy.
Come on in.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.387
Congratulations.
Case solved.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.954
Although I understand

40:35.041 --> 40:37.173
Jane may have irritated you
somewhat with his antics.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.958
Hey, all's well
that ends well, though, right?

40:39.045 --> 40:42.788
No. We have a problem.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.529
Oh?

40:44.616 --> 40:47.662
These past two days have
confirmed something for me.

40:47.749 --> 40:48.924
I think Patrick Jane
is a cunning

40:49.011 --> 40:50.796
manipulative sociopath.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.755
Oh.

40:53.842 --> 40:57.367
I think he's working
hand-in-hand with Red John.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.195
Really?

40:59.282 --> 41:01.371
If it's true,
we're taking him down.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.243
And you can help,
or you can go down with him.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.462
I'm sorry to be
so blunt

41:04.549 --> 41:06.855
but that's
the FBI perspective.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.468
You deserve full disclosure.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.777
Yes, I see.

41:17.823 --> 41:20.347
Well, you can count
on my full cooperation.

41:22.697 --> 41:25.265
Sorry to inconvenience
you, Mr. Philo.

41:25.352 --> 41:26.875
I'll sign you out
downstairs.

41:26.962 --> 41:29.835
You start thinking
about a new career, Wayne.

41:29.922 --> 41:33.839
'Cause this one's
all over for you.

41:33.926 --> 41:38.713
Ah. Well met. Well met.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.543
Uh, I was just, uh,
telling your hapless friend here

41:42.630 --> 41:47.026
I am gonna bury
you morons in lawsuits.

41:47.113 --> 41:48.418
You may think
you've won this one

41:48.506 --> 41:50.551
but look at
your hands, Mr. Philo.

41:50.638 --> 41:53.598
They're stained red
with Matilda's blood.

41:53.685 --> 41:54.947
Will all great
"Neptune's waters"

41:55.034 --> 41:57.471
wash that blood
clean from your hand?

41:57.558 --> 41:59.342
No.

41:59.429 --> 42:03.172
It's "Oceans."
"Neptune's oceans."

42:03.259 --> 42:04.217
You're right.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.305
"Neptune's oceans."

42:05.392 --> 42:08.047
"Macbeth," Act II, scene two.

42:08.134 --> 42:10.745
Shakespeare. You lied
to us, Mr. Philo.

42:10.832 --> 42:12.747
'Why would you lie to us?'

42:12.834 --> 42:15.315
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.796
No, no, no. No.

42:17.883 --> 42:20.755
You need to come talk
to us some more, Gary.

42:23.715 --> 42:24.890
I know. I know.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.108
You don't know
whether to hug me

42:26.195 --> 42:27.196
or to hit me.

42:27.283 --> 42:28.371
- Ugh!
- I--

42:28.458 --> 42:30.852
[instrumental music]

42:38.512 --> 42:40.732
[theme music]
