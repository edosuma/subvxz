Perfect.

02:20.546 --> 02:22.179
Sorry.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.966
Caretta.

03:04.990 --> 03:06.235
Hi, mama.

03:06.259 --> 03:08.237
I can't believe it.

03:08.261 --> 03:10.239
What a wonderful surprise.

03:10.263 --> 03:11.740
Sorry, I would have
called, I just...

03:11.764 --> 03:16.345
Oh, well, whatever brought
you I couldn't be happier.

03:16.369 --> 03:20.415
Oh... is everything alright?

03:20.439 --> 03:22.417
Of course.

03:22.441 --> 03:24.253
How long have you been
asking me to visit?

03:24.277 --> 03:25.320
Forever.

03:25.344 --> 03:27.689
And you're always too busy.

03:27.713 --> 03:28.923
Oh, baby.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.759
I have missed you.

03:30.783 --> 03:31.793
Come on in the house.

03:31.817 --> 03:32.628
You hungry?

03:32.652 --> 03:33.629
Yeah.

03:33.653 --> 03:35.096
Kick those shoes off.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.532
Go barefoot.

03:36.556 --> 03:38.200
No.

03:38.224 --> 03:41.203
You know, when you were little
I couldn't keep shoes on you.

03:41.227 --> 03:46.041
Mama, this house looks
a little run down.

03:46.065 --> 03:50.011
Well, we're just one big
shabby chic around here

03:50.035 --> 03:52.381
and I'm including myself.

03:52.405 --> 03:54.650
Can't stop the ruins of Rome.

03:54.674 --> 03:55.884
That's what I tell myself.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.555
What does that even mean?

03:59.579 --> 04:01.723
You get old.

04:01.747 --> 04:03.825
Mama, you're not old.

04:03.849 --> 04:06.917
Well, thank you, baby.

04:07.653 --> 04:09.353
Oh.

04:25.738 --> 04:27.182
You haven't changed a thing.

04:27.206 --> 04:29.084
Well, it's perfect
just the way it is.

04:29.108 --> 04:30.185
Why would I?

04:30.209 --> 04:31.386
Yeah.

04:31.410 --> 04:34.489
Oh.

04:34.513 --> 04:37.426
Boy, we had some good
times here, didn't we?

04:37.450 --> 04:41.485
You and your brother just running
around like wild things.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.271
How long can you stay?

04:49.295 --> 04:51.172
I don't know, a week?

04:51.196 --> 04:52.441
A week?

04:52.465 --> 04:57.646
Well, that's no time at all.

04:57.670 --> 05:01.383
They must be just working you
to death up there in Chicago.

05:01.407 --> 05:02.851
Let's not waste a minute.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.854
We'll walk on the beach.

05:05.878 --> 05:08.189
The turtles are layin'.

05:08.213 --> 05:10.459
Mama, the turtles...

05:10.483 --> 05:13.262
I think I'm gonna go
check out the marina.

05:13.286 --> 05:14.363
You still like shrimp?

05:14.387 --> 05:15.464
Of course I do.

05:15.488 --> 05:17.633
I'm still me, aren't I?

05:17.657 --> 05:20.491
I guess so, yeah.

05:51.457 --> 05:52.501
Would ya look at her.

05:52.525 --> 05:54.558
I know, right.

05:55.194 --> 05:56.605
Can I help you?

05:56.629 --> 05:59.308
Yeah, uh, two pounds
of shrimp, please.

05:59.332 --> 06:01.009
Two pounds of shrimp.

06:01.033 --> 06:02.733
You got it.

06:09.475 --> 06:10.919
First time on the island?

06:10.943 --> 06:12.954
Uh, no.

06:12.978 --> 06:15.524
Uh, I've been coming
here since I was a baby.

06:15.548 --> 06:16.325
Really?

06:16.349 --> 06:18.327
Yeah.

06:18.351 --> 06:20.128
I wouldn't have guessed.

06:20.152 --> 06:21.152
'Cause of these?

06:22.855 --> 06:24.299
Exactly.

06:24.323 --> 06:25.789
Yeah.

06:34.032 --> 06:35.377
I'd go with the brown ones.

06:35.401 --> 06:36.878
It matches your eyes.

06:39.071 --> 06:40.615
They are still brown, right?

06:40.639 --> 06:41.717
Brett.

06:41.741 --> 06:42.551
Didn't see you there.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.219
Uh, yes you did.

06:44.243 --> 06:46.888
I'll take the brown and the red.

06:46.912 --> 06:50.325
It matches the stain
on his t-shirt.

06:50.349 --> 06:51.393
Barbecue sauce.

06:51.417 --> 06:52.697
Still putting that
on everything?

06:52.721 --> 06:53.662
Yeah.

06:53.686 --> 06:54.926
Including my shirt, apparently.

06:54.950 --> 06:55.982
Hmm.

06:57.523 --> 06:58.800
Oh, Caretta.

06:58.824 --> 06:59.634
Uh, yeah.

06:59.658 --> 07:01.202
People don't call
me that anymore.

07:01.226 --> 07:02.036
That's too bad.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.405
How long has it
been, five years?

07:03.429 --> 07:04.506
Three, actually.

07:04.530 --> 07:05.474
Three.

07:05.498 --> 07:06.140
Mmmhmm.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.309
Your heels weren't as high.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.178
Yeah, and you had a fiancé.

07:10.202 --> 07:11.312
Right.

07:11.336 --> 07:12.514
Yeah, it didn't work out.

07:12.538 --> 07:13.515
No?

07:13.539 --> 07:15.299
She didn't like barbecue
sauce on everything?

07:16.174 --> 07:18.420
Yeah, pretty much.

07:18.444 --> 07:21.222
You know, I gotta tell ya,
I'm really glad to see you.

07:21.246 --> 07:22.557
Really?

07:22.581 --> 07:24.341
Yeah, your mom's been
worried sick about you.

07:24.365 --> 07:25.126
Oh.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.528
Wait, why is she
worried about me?

07:26.552 --> 07:28.029
She doesn't like
you being alone.

07:28.053 --> 07:29.531
Oh.

07:29.555 --> 07:32.367
Well, I am not alone, so...

07:32.391 --> 07:35.069
She says you're having
trouble finding a...

07:35.093 --> 07:36.838
a nice guy.

07:37.863 --> 07:40.742
You having fun embarrassing me?

07:40.766 --> 07:41.777
Kinda.

07:41.801 --> 07:42.778
Well, I should go.

07:42.802 --> 07:44.835
Wouldn't want my mom to worry.

07:50.242 --> 07:51.787
Oh, there we go!

07:51.811 --> 07:53.087
Those were very expensive!

07:53.111 --> 07:55.424
Most useless things are!

07:55.448 --> 07:56.925
<i>I'll see you around, Caretta!</i>

07:56.949 --> 07:58.727
If you're lucky!

08:13.131 --> 08:15.109
Lovie!

08:15.133 --> 08:16.377
Did you hear?

08:16.401 --> 08:17.078
Hear what?

08:17.102 --> 08:19.314
Two new nests, right back there.

08:19.338 --> 08:21.416
Two, why didn't you tell me?

08:21.440 --> 08:23.251
Well, I just did.

08:23.275 --> 08:25.554
I thought you were
coming out earlier.

08:25.578 --> 08:27.322
I had a surprise.

08:27.346 --> 08:29.458
Cara came to see me.

08:29.482 --> 08:31.159
Lovie.

08:31.183 --> 08:32.626
Oh, that's wonderful.

08:32.650 --> 08:33.929
How is she?

08:33.953 --> 08:35.897
The same.

08:35.921 --> 08:38.265
Maybe more so.

08:38.289 --> 08:41.436
Well, I'm sure the advertising
world is stressful.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.438
She's a real
go-getter, that girl.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.106
She always has been.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.274
Where is she?

08:46.298 --> 08:47.676
In town.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.478
Anything to avoid my turtles.

08:51.003 --> 08:53.949
Well, this might come as
a shock but not everyone

08:53.973 --> 08:56.017
in the universe wants
to spend their day

08:56.041 --> 08:57.853
staking turtle's nests.

08:57.877 --> 09:00.355
Well, I don't know why not.

09:00.379 --> 09:02.757
Especially my own daughter.

09:02.781 --> 09:05.760
That apple rolled
far from this tree.

09:05.784 --> 09:07.829
The nest is right over here.

09:07.853 --> 09:08.964
Look at that.

09:08.988 --> 09:09.998
Yes, it's beautiful.

09:10.022 --> 09:11.833
Isn't that wonderful?

09:11.857 --> 09:13.702
Can you believe it?

09:13.726 --> 09:16.337
It's huge.

09:16.361 --> 09:17.806
Ok, here we go.

09:17.830 --> 09:21.643
Now, where did you
put those eggs?

09:21.667 --> 09:23.011
Be careful.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.568
Ok, it's not there.

09:27.673 --> 09:28.717
Try the center.

09:28.741 --> 09:29.773
Okay.

09:31.954 --> 09:32.954
Oh.

09:32.978 --> 09:35.390
Yes!

09:35.414 --> 09:38.026
Oh, that's fabulous.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.917
I just love it.

09:46.091 --> 09:48.003
Hi.

09:48.027 --> 09:49.404
Hi.

09:49.428 --> 09:51.205
Oh, you're Caretta.

09:51.229 --> 09:54.543
Sorry, I recognized
you from your photos.

09:54.567 --> 09:57.478
Just making Mama Lovie
her green smoothie.

09:57.502 --> 09:58.713
Mama Lovie?

09:58.737 --> 10:03.985
Uh, yeah... just a
silly little thing.

10:04.009 --> 10:09.223
I call her Mama Lovie and
she calls me Mama Toy.

10:09.247 --> 10:10.825
'Cause I'm expecting.

10:10.849 --> 10:14.228
I see that.

10:14.252 --> 10:16.431
Do you mind taking
this to her for me?

10:16.455 --> 10:17.815
I'm just gonna head
off to my room.

10:17.839 --> 10:19.000
It was nice meeting you.

10:19.024 --> 10:21.235
Your room?

10:21.259 --> 10:22.604
What room?

10:22.628 --> 10:24.539
Uh, Palmer's room.

10:24.563 --> 10:25.774
Palmer's room.

10:25.798 --> 10:26.830
Yeah.

10:31.804 --> 10:35.884
Toy's only 20 years old.
Alone and pregnant.

10:35.908 --> 10:37.686
She's like a companion.

10:37.710 --> 10:40.711
She helps me out and
I help her out.

10:42.815 --> 10:45.060
So you asked her to
move in with you?

10:45.084 --> 10:45.860
Why not?

10:45.884 --> 10:48.296
No one else is
using those rooms.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.900
Besides, she has no family.

10:51.924 --> 10:53.401
What about the baby's father?

10:53.425 --> 10:54.368
A bolter.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.104
Gone like the wind.

10:56.128 --> 10:57.606
Flo heard about her situation

10:57.630 --> 11:00.909
and thought I could
use some help.

11:00.933 --> 11:03.979
She's a sweet girl.

11:04.003 --> 11:05.780
I didn't know you
like green juices.

11:05.804 --> 11:06.715
No.

11:06.739 --> 11:08.116
I don't.

11:08.140 --> 11:09.718
But Toy thinks
they're good for me

11:09.742 --> 11:12.487
and I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.891
Oh honey, can you go
get that, please?

11:14.915 --> 11:17.282
Yeah.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.094
Hello?

11:19.118 --> 11:20.662
<i>Cara?</i>

11:20.686 --> 11:21.963
Palmer.

11:21.987 --> 11:23.999
<i>You sound just like a Yankee.</i>

11:24.023 --> 11:25.900
<i>And your accent gets
thicker by the year.</i>

11:25.924 --> 11:28.136
Oh, you know nothing
ever changes down here.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.771
Not the weather,
not the accents.

11:29.795 --> 11:30.672
<i>How long are you in town for?</i>

11:30.696 --> 11:33.508
I was gonna stay a
week but I don't know

11:33.532 --> 11:35.143
if I'll last that long.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.411
Advertising world can't
live without you, huh?

11:37.435 --> 11:39.580
Something like that.

11:39.604 --> 11:40.548
How's the family?

11:40.572 --> 11:42.283
How about you come see
them for yourself?

11:42.307 --> 11:44.953
You and mom come out to
Charleston for the weekend.

11:44.977 --> 11:47.288
Yeah, I don't know if
I'm gonna make it.

11:47.312 --> 11:48.592
<i>I ain't takin' no for an answer.</i>

11:48.616 --> 11:50.959
<i>You haven't been up to the
house since daddy's funeral.</i>

11:50.983 --> 11:53.028
Look, I'll make you
some frogmore stew.

11:54.519 --> 11:55.697
You remembered.

11:55.721 --> 11:56.931
Daddy!

11:56.955 --> 11:58.133
Oh, little lady.

11:58.157 --> 12:00.935
How am I supposed to forget
my sister's favorite meal?

12:00.959 --> 12:02.719
Can you help me with
these golf clubs, buddy?

12:02.743 --> 12:03.171
Yes.

12:03.195 --> 12:04.205
Is mama home?

12:04.229 --> 12:06.063
Hey honey, I'm home.

12:17.142 --> 12:18.853
I don't think she likes me.

12:18.877 --> 12:22.190
She's just been away
too long, that's all.

12:22.214 --> 12:25.493
She'll come around.

12:25.517 --> 12:31.833
I do get the sense that something
else is bothering her.

12:31.857 --> 12:33.802
She was never the type
of daughter to confide

12:33.826 --> 12:36.359
in her mother.

12:42.034 --> 12:45.080
You think this is why
she came to visit?

12:45.104 --> 12:46.647
She doesn't know
anything about it

12:46.671 --> 12:50.218
and we're gonna keep
it that way, right?

12:50.242 --> 12:51.219
Don't you worry.

12:51.243 --> 12:53.276
Everything's gonna be ok.

12:56.414 --> 12:59.728
I'm so excited about
the frogmore stew.

12:59.752 --> 13:01.896
That is a lovely idea.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.233
And I haven't been to
the house in ages.

13:05.257 --> 13:06.735
You say that like
it's an expedition.

13:06.759 --> 13:08.903
It's less than an hour away.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.705
And it's your house.

13:10.729 --> 13:13.374
Well, it's really Palmer's now.

13:13.398 --> 13:17.411
And besides, why leave paradise?

13:17.435 --> 13:19.914
Looks like paradise could
use a little fixing up.

13:19.938 --> 13:22.178
And the pergola looks like it
could come down any minute.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.752
We're fine.

13:23.776 --> 13:28.422
And besides, Palmer's got
me on a strict budget.

13:28.446 --> 13:32.393
Palmer has you on a budget?

13:32.417 --> 13:34.295
I have an idea.

13:34.319 --> 13:36.231
Why don't we make a
casserole together

13:36.255 --> 13:38.933
and we can take it over to
Palmer's Saturday night?

13:38.957 --> 13:40.869
Are you sure?

13:40.893 --> 13:43.404
But that's a family thing.

13:43.428 --> 13:47.642
Well, you're family too, baby.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.066
<i>I'd love to. Thank you.</i>

14:02.447 --> 14:04.592
Evening, Caretta.

14:04.616 --> 14:07.295
Hi Brett.

14:07.319 --> 14:09.597
You brought flowers.

14:09.621 --> 14:10.431
Yes I did.

14:10.455 --> 14:11.599
That's very nice.

14:11.623 --> 14:12.801
I try.

14:12.825 --> 14:13.634
Thank you.

14:13.658 --> 14:15.018
You saved me a trip
to the nursery.

14:15.042 --> 14:16.237
I was going right by there.

14:16.261 --> 14:17.901
Now, let's have a look
at that leaky sink.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.808
And you're staying for dinner.

14:19.832 --> 14:20.608
If you insist.

14:20.632 --> 14:22.076
I hope you brought
your appetite.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.800
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

14:29.208 --> 14:31.853
How did you like what Brett's
done with the marina, sweetie?

14:31.877 --> 14:32.987
It's lovely, mama.

14:33.011 --> 14:37.091
Yeah, it has changed a lot
since you two were dating.

14:37.115 --> 14:41.662
Oh, Brett and Cara made
the cutest couple.

14:41.686 --> 14:43.164
It was one summer, mom.

14:43.188 --> 14:44.165
Ta-da-da-da-da...

14:44.189 --> 14:46.801
Actually, I think it was
about a year and a half.

14:46.825 --> 14:49.503
If we're counting that
summer you went to Chicago.

14:49.527 --> 14:50.604
We're not.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.506
Riding on the boat ride?

14:52.530 --> 14:54.375
You stranded us on purpose.

14:54.399 --> 14:55.543
<i>We ran out of gas.</i>

14:55.567 --> 14:57.145
Did we?

14:57.169 --> 14:59.214
<i>Who can remember these things?</i>

14:59.238 --> 15:01.615
I... maybe I had a spare
tank of gas somewhere.

15:03.342 --> 15:04.552
Uh-huh.

15:04.576 --> 15:07.588
Oh, there is nothing
like first love.

15:07.612 --> 15:10.024
I will never understand
why you two broke up.

15:10.048 --> 15:11.059
Me either.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.328
His life is here and mine's not.

15:13.352 --> 15:14.729
Plus, she was a little snooty.

15:14.753 --> 15:17.398
I wasn't snooty.

15:17.422 --> 15:18.699
Was I snooty?

15:18.723 --> 15:21.069
No.

15:23.595 --> 15:26.341
Ok, maybe a little.

15:26.365 --> 15:27.742
To Cara and Brett.

15:27.766 --> 15:28.977
And the turtles.

15:29.001 --> 15:30.544
How about just to the turtles?

15:30.568 --> 15:31.679
To the turtles.

15:31.703 --> 15:33.203
To the turtles.

15:34.273 --> 15:38.920
Well, if y'all will excuse me,
I'm gonna head on up to bed.

15:38.944 --> 15:40.355
Me too.

15:40.379 --> 15:42.357
What?

15:42.381 --> 15:43.224
'Night, Lovie.

15:43.248 --> 15:44.192
Thanks for dinner.

15:44.216 --> 15:45.526
Good night.

15:45.550 --> 15:46.550
Have fun.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.898
Do you believe this?

15:49.922 --> 15:51.099
What?

15:51.123 --> 15:52.867
They're trying to set us up.

15:52.891 --> 15:53.534
Hey, don't look at me.

15:53.558 --> 15:54.735
I just came to fix the sink.

15:54.759 --> 15:56.404
The sink that wasn't broken.

15:59.898 --> 16:03.577
So uh... I saw one of
your ad campaigns.

16:03.601 --> 16:04.245
You did?

16:04.269 --> 16:05.246
Mmmhmm.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.782
Cheese-less mac and cheese.

16:07.806 --> 16:10.184
Yeah, Lovie, she-she cut
it out of a magazine,

16:10.208 --> 16:11.752
distributed it all
over the island.

16:11.776 --> 16:12.620
Oh no.

16:12.644 --> 16:13.321
Oh yes.

16:13.345 --> 16:15.623
And I gotta tell you the truth.

16:15.647 --> 16:16.891
I bought a box.

16:16.915 --> 16:18.026
What'd you think?

16:18.050 --> 16:18.960
It needed cheese.

16:18.984 --> 16:19.984
Yeah.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.596
I'm sorry. I'll reimburse you.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.460
Ah, well then you're gonna
have to reimburse me

16:23.484 --> 16:25.900
for that better butter spray
stuff, too, God it was awful.

16:25.924 --> 16:27.768
Oh God, now I'm
really embarrassed.

16:29.161 --> 16:30.571
Don't be.

16:30.595 --> 16:31.595
Look at you.

16:33.498 --> 16:36.377
You moved away and
achieved your dreams.

16:36.401 --> 16:39.447
How many people can say that?

16:39.471 --> 16:41.549
A lot of people.

16:41.573 --> 16:43.084
Only one I know.

16:43.108 --> 16:45.608
She's sitting right there.

16:50.648 --> 16:53.561
It's really sweet the way
you look after Lovie.

16:53.585 --> 16:55.596
She does her share of
looking after me, too.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.498
I doubt you need
much looking after.

16:57.522 --> 17:00.256
Every now and then
we all do, right?

17:05.473 --> 17:06.594
Do you remember when we said

17:06.617 --> 17:10.111
the only thing we
wanted was to be happy?

17:10.135 --> 17:13.114
I'm pretty sure I'm the
one that said that, yeah.

17:13.137 --> 17:15.349
Oh.

17:15.374 --> 17:18.152
What did I say?

17:18.175 --> 17:21.422
You wanted more.

17:21.445 --> 17:23.156
I said that?

17:23.181 --> 17:26.461
Yeah.

17:26.484 --> 17:28.929
You have a good memory.

17:28.953 --> 17:30.931
Unfortunately for both
of us that's true.

17:34.393 --> 17:38.161
Well, goodnight, Caretta.

17:39.664 --> 17:43.811
Uh, you know, I was thinkin'...

17:43.835 --> 17:48.149
maybe we finish that boat
ride while you're around.

17:48.173 --> 17:50.518
I don't know.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.487
I got a bigger tank of gas.

17:52.511 --> 17:54.655
Ooh, and a new boat.

17:54.679 --> 17:57.191
It's just that I'm not
here for very long, so...

17:57.215 --> 17:59.494
Did you just see me get down
on one knee and propose?

17:59.518 --> 18:00.328
No.

18:00.352 --> 18:01.632
It's just a spin
up the waterway.

18:01.656 --> 18:02.530
Come on.

18:02.554 --> 18:04.499
It's just that I don't
wanna waste your time

18:04.523 --> 18:06.334
with me leaving and everything.

18:06.358 --> 18:07.635
Uh-huh.

18:07.659 --> 18:11.472
Well, what was I thinking?

18:11.496 --> 18:13.763
Have a wonderful night, Caretta.

18:33.218 --> 18:34.562
You ok?

18:34.586 --> 18:35.496
You alright?

18:35.520 --> 18:36.697
<i>Yeah, I'm ok.</i>

18:36.721 --> 18:38.721
Just got a little
dizzy, that's all.

18:41.093 --> 18:42.503
Oh, hello.

18:42.527 --> 18:44.105
Mama, you ok?

18:44.129 --> 18:47.608
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

18:47.632 --> 18:49.592
You would think that I would
know to eat breakfast

18:49.616 --> 18:52.046
before I go check
on my loggerheads.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.714
We have a new nest.

18:53.738 --> 18:55.683
Do you wanna come see the nest?

18:55.707 --> 18:59.053
I would love to but I was
gonna do a little shopping

18:59.077 --> 19:00.588
in town if that's ok?

19:00.612 --> 19:01.889
Of course, baby.

19:01.913 --> 19:03.157
You don't need my permission.

19:03.181 --> 19:05.025
Just be sure you're back in time
to get to Charleston for dinner.

19:05.049 --> 19:05.593
Ok.

19:05.617 --> 19:08.729
Oh, oh, oh, and um...

19:08.753 --> 19:11.632
you might wanna
change that dress.

19:11.656 --> 19:13.767
You don't wanna get it wet
in case you're on a boat

19:13.791 --> 19:15.203
or something.

19:15.227 --> 19:16.737
I'm not getting on a boat.

19:17.962 --> 19:19.061
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

19:40.695 --> 19:41.695
Hi.

19:41.719 --> 19:44.565
Would you like to rent
a boat today, ma'am?

19:44.589 --> 19:47.768
This place is more
fancy than I remember.

19:47.792 --> 19:52.173
Yeah, yeah, you gotta keep up
appearances for the boat people.

19:52.197 --> 19:54.509
Especially the
ones from Chicago.

19:54.533 --> 19:55.943
They're persnickety.

19:55.967 --> 19:56.910
Persnickety?

19:56.934 --> 19:57.711
Uh-huh.

19:57.735 --> 19:58.579
Who says persnickety?

19:58.603 --> 20:02.016
I saw it in this
morning's crossword.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.050
It means picky.

20:03.074 --> 20:05.419
I know what it means.

20:05.443 --> 20:06.920
Here.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.890
Oh, you didn't have to do this.

20:09.914 --> 20:11.192
I put in extra barbecue sauce.

20:11.216 --> 20:13.528
Uh-huh.

20:13.552 --> 20:15.563
I see you kept your
dad's boathouse.

20:15.587 --> 20:17.153
Sentimental value.

20:21.426 --> 20:22.986
I thought maybe, you
know, I don't know,

20:23.010 --> 20:25.072
for old time's sake, maybe
if you wanted to go out

20:25.096 --> 20:26.707
on the water or something...

20:26.731 --> 20:27.608
Are you asking me out?

20:27.632 --> 20:29.243
No.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.645
No, it's just out on the water.

20:30.669 --> 20:31.546
It's not out.

20:31.570 --> 20:32.647
Out is out.

20:32.671 --> 20:33.113
It's not...

20:33.137 --> 20:33.747
Brett?

20:33.771 --> 20:34.715
Yeah?

20:34.739 --> 20:36.651
Hey. Uh, we're from the
Coastal Commission.

20:36.675 --> 20:39.153
Terry said you could help us
with the dolphin research?

20:39.177 --> 20:40.655
Right, no, yeah, he called.

20:40.679 --> 20:42.423
Uh, let me help you aboard.
Come on.

20:42.447 --> 20:45.159
You a dolphin expert now?

20:45.183 --> 20:46.661
Jack of all trades.

20:46.685 --> 20:47.628
Come on, Cara.

20:47.652 --> 20:48.262
There's plenty of room.

20:48.286 --> 20:48.962
No. That's ok.

20:48.986 --> 20:49.664
Join us.

20:49.688 --> 20:50.331
Another time.

20:50.355 --> 20:51.799
I'm gonna hold you to that.

20:51.823 --> 20:52.855
<i>Ok.</i>

21:25.223 --> 21:27.368
Boat ride over already?

21:27.392 --> 21:30.059
Brett was busy.

21:32.731 --> 21:35.343
Mama, what are all these photos?

21:35.367 --> 21:38.679
Oh, it's a project I'm
finally getting around to.

21:38.703 --> 21:40.481
Hmm.

21:40.505 --> 21:43.150
Look at my Lady Bank roses.

21:43.174 --> 21:44.485
They're so beautiful.

21:44.509 --> 21:45.553
The fragrance.

21:45.577 --> 21:48.723
You could smell it all the
way down to the beach.

21:48.747 --> 21:50.491
Mmm.

21:50.515 --> 21:51.947
Who's this?

21:53.718 --> 21:57.331
Oh, that's Russell.

21:57.355 --> 21:58.132
Russell?

21:58.156 --> 21:59.367
Russell Bennet.

21:59.391 --> 22:01.001
He owned some property
on the beach.

22:01.025 --> 22:02.202
Mmm.

22:02.226 --> 22:03.137
You're blushing.

22:03.161 --> 22:04.037
I am not.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.273
You are.

22:05.297 --> 22:07.908
He's the one that taught me
about the turtles, that's all.

22:07.932 --> 22:08.842
Oh, that's all?

22:08.866 --> 22:11.011
It was a lifetime ago.

22:11.035 --> 22:13.881
Before I met your father.

22:13.905 --> 22:16.049
Well, we better get
dressed for dinner.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.885
There might be traffic.

22:17.909 --> 22:18.753
Ok.

22:18.777 --> 22:20.388
Where did I put my pearls?

22:20.412 --> 22:21.221
Pearls?

22:21.245 --> 22:22.657
Mama, we're just
going to Palmer's.

22:22.681 --> 22:25.159
I know, but every
time I go in town

22:25.183 --> 22:28.829
some proper southern
lady takes over.

22:28.853 --> 22:30.398
Nothing fits.

22:30.422 --> 22:33.066
Oh honey, you look so pretty.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.769
Not for your son's house.

22:34.793 --> 22:35.903
Oh, for heaven sakes.

22:35.927 --> 22:37.271
I'll tell you what.

22:37.295 --> 22:39.206
Put this on.

22:39.230 --> 22:41.742
Now there you go.

22:41.766 --> 22:42.710
Let's see.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.712
Oh yes.

22:44.736 --> 22:45.913
You look so nice.

22:45.937 --> 22:48.215
Why don't you just keep it?

22:48.239 --> 22:49.517
Thank you, that's so sweet.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.453
<i>So Palmer's fish AND the boat
keys ended up in the water.</i>

22:56.314 --> 22:57.425
You talk funny.

22:57.449 --> 22:58.426
I do?

22:58.450 --> 23:00.428
That's 'cause she sounds
like a Yankee now.

23:00.452 --> 23:01.595
What's a Yankee?

23:01.619 --> 23:03.197
I'll tell you what a Yankee is.

23:03.221 --> 23:04.941
A Yankee is someone that
leaves their family

23:04.965 --> 23:06.442
without even a backwards glance.

23:06.466 --> 23:09.804
He lost at golf today which
always makes him cranky.

23:09.828 --> 23:11.706
I'm not cranky.

23:11.730 --> 23:13.741
Welcome home, favorite sister.

23:13.765 --> 23:15.576
She's your only sister.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.577
Careful with that drink.

23:16.601 --> 23:18.779
Might put the southern
back in you, Caretta.

23:18.803 --> 23:20.715
How come you call her Caretta?

23:20.739 --> 23:22.717
That's her name, sweetheart.

23:22.741 --> 23:24.284
It was.

23:24.308 --> 23:25.653
I like it.

23:25.677 --> 23:26.709
Me too.

23:27.812 --> 23:31.325
Caretta is the scientific
name for the loggerheads.

23:31.349 --> 23:34.895
The world's largest
hardshell turtle.

23:34.919 --> 23:37.498
Your grandmother thinks
I have a hard shell.

23:37.522 --> 23:40.167
I named you after
something I love.

23:40.191 --> 23:42.503
It's a good thing she
didn't name me "shrimp".

23:43.995 --> 23:45.639
To our family.

23:45.663 --> 23:49.176
All back together again.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.244
Cheers.

23:50.268 --> 23:51.268
Cheers.

23:54.672 --> 23:57.150
Toy, honey, let's
go into the kitchen

23:57.174 --> 23:58.986
and help Julia with dinner.

23:59.010 --> 24:02.445
She is one of Charleston's
finest cooks.

24:08.686 --> 24:11.131
I don't recall her being
that motherly to us.

24:11.155 --> 24:12.366
You know mama.

24:12.390 --> 24:14.268
Always a sucker for
the lost cause.

24:14.292 --> 24:16.303
Just like she is
for her turtles.

24:16.327 --> 24:17.304
Why don't you come on in?

24:17.328 --> 24:20.162
I'll show you what Julia's
done with the place.

24:24.536 --> 24:26.380
There he is.

24:26.404 --> 24:29.104
Still staring down at us.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.176
Can you believe he's been
gone three years now?

24:36.681 --> 24:38.292
Everything's so different.

24:38.316 --> 24:39.316
Yeah.

24:43.154 --> 24:45.800
What'd mama think?

24:45.824 --> 24:47.234
Mama?

24:47.258 --> 24:48.702
Yeah.

24:48.726 --> 24:50.646
I'd think she'd wanna start
dismantling the house

24:50.670 --> 24:53.741
and sell it now that he's gone.

24:53.765 --> 24:56.143
Did she say something to you?

24:56.167 --> 24:58.879
Or are you speculating?

24:58.903 --> 25:01.515
You gonna come eat, you two?

25:01.539 --> 25:02.972
Yes, dear.

25:04.776 --> 25:06.208
After you.

25:08.279 --> 25:11.659
<i>Just like his
daddy, right honey.</i>

25:11.683 --> 25:13.563
What about that time you
flipped that golf cart?

25:13.587 --> 25:14.027
Oh God.

25:14.051 --> 25:15.051
You remember that?

25:16.955 --> 25:20.100
I've never seen daddy so worried
and mad at the same time.

25:23.427 --> 25:24.438
Man.

25:24.462 --> 25:27.441
Well, Julia darling, this
has just been lovely.

25:27.465 --> 25:29.610
But we better be
getting on the road.

25:29.634 --> 25:30.310
Oh, no.

25:30.334 --> 25:31.011
The night's still young, mama.

25:31.035 --> 25:32.680
Oh, Palmer, it's a long drive.

25:32.704 --> 25:33.380
I don't ever get to see you.

25:33.404 --> 25:34.604
Just stay a little bit longer.

25:34.628 --> 25:36.416
Palmer, it's a long drive.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.351
Stay a little bit longer.

25:37.375 --> 25:38.118
I'm tired-

25:38.142 --> 25:39.186
I don't get to see you-

25:39.210 --> 25:40.643
Palmer, stop!

25:46.050 --> 25:48.370
Well, if y'all don't mind I'm
gonna go rest up on the couch

25:48.394 --> 25:48.929
a little bit.

25:48.953 --> 25:49.930
Ok sweetheart.

25:49.954 --> 25:50.731
That's ok?

25:50.755 --> 25:52.187
Yes, baby.

25:56.327 --> 26:00.374
Look, I was thinking about
what you said earlier.

26:00.398 --> 26:02.743
About the house and um...

26:02.767 --> 26:07.748
mama, I think you should come
stay here with Julie and I.

26:07.772 --> 26:08.482
What?

26:08.506 --> 26:09.416
Yeah.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.784
Why?

26:10.808 --> 26:13.120
Because I miss you.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.723
Do I need another reason?

26:15.747 --> 26:16.590
Besides, that old beach house?

26:16.614 --> 26:19.927
A little wind could
blow that place down.

26:19.951 --> 26:24.097
Primrose Cottage has survived
a number of hurricanes.

26:24.121 --> 26:26.634
I am fine right where I am.

26:26.658 --> 26:29.018
Yeah, mama, I just don't like
you out there all by yourself.

26:29.042 --> 26:30.437
I'm not by myself.

26:30.461 --> 26:33.440
Toy is with me.

26:33.464 --> 26:36.644
Well, that's something else
we need to talk about.

26:36.668 --> 26:40.180
She is a sweet girl.

26:40.204 --> 26:43.817
I'm sure she is, but best
be counting the silver.

26:43.841 --> 26:45.586
Palmer!

26:45.610 --> 26:46.520
<i>What?</i>

26:46.544 --> 26:48.656
What? That's what daddy
would always say.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.292
Trouble is, Palmer, all of
mama's silver is here with you.

26:52.316 --> 26:54.929
Along with the
rest of the house.

26:54.953 --> 26:57.631
You don't have a
horse in this race.

26:57.655 --> 26:59.700
You left us a long time ago.

26:59.724 --> 27:02.469
Besides, I haven't taken
anything from anyone.

27:02.493 --> 27:05.105
I'm simply managing
mama's affairs.

27:05.129 --> 27:07.129
You know she doesn't
have a mind for numbers.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.133
When did you become
just like daddy?

27:13.471 --> 27:15.482
Mama, tell him you're
perfectly capable of handling

27:15.506 --> 27:16.939
your own affairs.

27:20.344 --> 27:23.457
He's right, I-I'm not
particularly good

27:23.481 --> 27:25.659
at those sort of things.

27:25.683 --> 27:27.461
You see?

27:27.485 --> 27:29.997
And that's that.

27:30.021 --> 27:33.400
Sweetheart, will you please
cut me another slice of cake?

27:33.424 --> 27:34.784
I think we've all
had enough sugar-

27:34.808 --> 27:36.637
I asked for another
slice of cake.

27:36.661 --> 27:39.662
Will you please cut it for me?

27:49.043 --> 27:51.421
I didn't realize anyone was up.

27:51.445 --> 27:52.890
Sorry, I couldn't sleep.

27:52.914 --> 27:53.991
I'll get out of your way.

27:54.015 --> 27:55.447
Hang on, Toy.

27:58.229 --> 27:59.229
I'm sorry about Palmer,

27:59.253 --> 28:01.031
I don't know much you heard.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.366
I didn't belong there, anyway.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.868
Don't say that.

28:03.892 --> 28:06.203
He had no right to
talk like that.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.404
It's fine.

28:07.428 --> 28:09.006
It's not fine.

28:09.030 --> 28:11.475
And I haven't been
that nice, either.

28:11.499 --> 28:12.209
It's...

28:12.233 --> 28:14.411
Maybe I can make it up to you?

28:14.435 --> 28:17.214
I could take you to lunch
before I leave today?

28:17.238 --> 28:19.650
Before you leave?

28:19.674 --> 28:21.194
I... I thought you
were staying a week?

28:21.218 --> 28:25.422
Yeah, um... I- I gotta get back.

28:25.446 --> 28:27.858
Cara, honey.

28:27.882 --> 28:30.394
Why are you leaving?

28:30.418 --> 28:32.229
Is this about last night?

28:32.253 --> 28:34.231
Mama, I just don't fit in here.

28:34.255 --> 28:35.365
I never did.

28:35.389 --> 28:38.168
Oh honey, that's not true.

28:38.192 --> 28:40.704
Please don't mind Palmer.

28:40.728 --> 28:43.541
He means well underneath.

28:43.565 --> 28:45.275
He's a good boy.

28:45.299 --> 28:46.677
Go ahead and defend him.

28:46.701 --> 28:48.712
Just like you defended daddy.

28:48.736 --> 28:50.614
You know I don't
like confrontation.

28:50.638 --> 28:52.516
Why?

28:52.540 --> 28:55.218
Because it's not ladylike?

28:55.242 --> 28:58.055
We're supposed to just smile
and needlepoint our lives away

28:58.079 --> 28:59.890
and everything will
magically be alright?

28:59.914 --> 29:01.592
Honey, now you're
just being dramatic.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.226
No, I'm not.

29:03.250 --> 29:05.863
I grew up watching the
way daddy treated you.

29:05.887 --> 29:09.466
The perfect docile wife
that made daddy look good

29:09.490 --> 29:11.936
at the country club.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.160
Don't you ever wonder why I
ran away when I was younger?

29:14.184 --> 29:15.904
I know you had to get
away from your father,

29:15.928 --> 29:17.541
you two were like
fire and gasoline.

29:17.565 --> 29:18.275
No.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.076
Not because of him.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.010
Because of you.

29:20.034 --> 29:22.947
You couldn't stand
up to him, not once.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.415
And now you can't
stand up to Palmer.

29:25.439 --> 29:28.452
Cara.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.956
I'm not like you, mom.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.780
I'll never be.

30:18.893 --> 30:21.093
Mama.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.611
I'm sorry.

30:27.635 --> 30:28.411
I know.

30:28.435 --> 30:31.982
I didn't mean those
things I said.

30:32.006 --> 30:34.006
You're right.

30:36.010 --> 30:38.722
I've made a million mistakes.

30:38.746 --> 30:41.291
We all have.

30:41.315 --> 30:42.660
I didn't come here to fight.

30:42.684 --> 30:44.684
I know, sweetheart.

30:49.090 --> 30:52.736
Mama, what are all
those pills for?

30:52.760 --> 30:56.339
Oh, um... just this and that.

30:56.363 --> 30:57.207
Nothing.

30:57.231 --> 31:02.146
I'm um... vitamins.

31:02.170 --> 31:06.150
I've never known you to take
anything resembling a vitamin.

31:06.174 --> 31:10.988
Well, you haven't been
around that much.

31:11.012 --> 31:18.328
Oh, Toy's on a health regimen
and I thought why not?

31:18.352 --> 31:20.263
I'm glad you're not here alone.

31:20.287 --> 31:22.933
Oh, baby.

31:22.957 --> 31:25.569
I could never be alone here.

31:25.593 --> 31:30.273
There are way too many memories.

31:30.297 --> 31:34.444
Cara, I um...

31:34.468 --> 31:39.016
I'm sure you've got a lot of
work piling up in Chicago but...

31:39.040 --> 31:41.719
could you stay a little longer?

31:41.743 --> 31:44.688
You just got here.

31:44.712 --> 31:46.223
Ok.

31:46.247 --> 31:47.290
Ok.

31:47.314 --> 31:49.093
Mmmhmm.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.227
Just like that.

31:50.251 --> 31:51.228
No argument.

31:51.252 --> 31:52.252
Nope.

31:54.822 --> 31:56.533
<i>Lovie, are you ready to go?</i>

31:56.557 --> 32:01.038
Oh, I'm gonna take Toy
on her appointment.

32:01.062 --> 32:02.305
Mama, I can take her.

32:02.329 --> 32:06.076
No baby, you stay here
and let Brett in.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.277
Brett?

32:07.301 --> 32:09.479
He's coming over
to fix the sink.

32:09.503 --> 32:10.981
He just fixed it two days ago.

32:11.005 --> 32:13.650
Oh, it broke again.

32:13.674 --> 32:15.819
Mama, are you breaking things
just so he'll come by?

32:15.843 --> 32:18.277
Now would I do that?

32:21.348 --> 32:23.415
Yes, you would.

32:33.094 --> 32:34.805
Sink's fine.

32:34.829 --> 32:35.973
Of course it is.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.507
I'm sorry.

32:37.531 --> 32:38.575
That's ok.

32:38.599 --> 32:41.411
Guess what? Turns out I
have the afternoon off.

32:41.435 --> 32:42.479
Oh, that's ok.

32:42.503 --> 32:43.413
What're you talking about?

32:43.437 --> 32:45.315
Come on, we wouldn't
wanna let Lovie down.

32:45.339 --> 32:46.449
We wouldn't want
to disappoint her.

32:46.473 --> 32:47.713
She put so much work into this.

32:47.737 --> 32:49.119
I've disappointed her plenty.

32:49.143 --> 32:50.220
Nah.

32:50.244 --> 32:52.489
It's all she talks about,
how proud of you she is.

32:52.513 --> 32:53.991
Come on.

32:54.015 --> 32:57.427
You owe me a boat ride.

32:57.451 --> 33:05.451
♪

33:07.494 --> 33:15.494
♪

33:18.840 --> 33:21.685
It's been forever
since I've done this.

33:21.709 --> 33:24.121
Pretty sure you've got a
big-sized lake up there.

33:24.145 --> 33:25.622
Yeah.

33:25.646 --> 33:30.527
Yeah, I can see it from
my 30th story window.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.830
Sounds tall.

33:32.854 --> 33:33.997
Yeah.

33:34.021 --> 33:35.132
It is.

33:35.156 --> 33:39.169
Especially when the
elevators break.

33:39.193 --> 33:43.406
There's something to be said
about a ground floor, huh?

33:43.430 --> 33:44.463
Yeah.

34:02.616 --> 34:04.296
You're so lucky you get
to do what you love

34:04.320 --> 34:06.363
every day.

34:06.387 --> 34:08.331
Don't you?

34:08.356 --> 34:11.768
Well, I've spent
every waking moment

34:11.792 --> 34:15.239
for the last five
years in an office.

34:15.263 --> 34:17.841
That's a lot of moments.

34:17.864 --> 34:19.664
It's very competitive.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.074
I got fired a
couple of days ago.

34:32.646 --> 34:35.313
You're the first
person I've told.

34:37.985 --> 34:39.295
I'm sorry.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.130
It's ok.

34:41.155 --> 34:44.268
I do feel a little
blindsided though.

34:44.292 --> 34:45.724
Yeah.

34:47.261 --> 34:51.141
Richard, my co-worker -

34:51.165 --> 34:52.809
he was a little more
than my co-worker -

34:52.833 --> 34:55.833
he's the one who threw
me under the bus.

35:02.109 --> 35:03.742
Right there.

35:39.713 --> 35:41.146
Alright.

35:43.717 --> 35:45.150
There we go.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.427
Welcome home.

36:11.045 --> 36:14.557
I wish I had different news.

36:14.581 --> 36:18.996
I do think you should
continue the treatment.

36:19.020 --> 36:20.964
Will it cure me?

36:20.988 --> 36:25.369
Well, as I said,
there is no cure.

36:25.393 --> 36:27.337
And the tumor can't
be operated on,

36:27.361 --> 36:29.406
but radiation will
give us more time-

36:29.430 --> 36:33.377
Tell me, Dr. Pittman,

36:33.401 --> 36:38.181
if you had one summer left

36:38.205 --> 36:41.140
would you spend it
getting radiation?

36:45.046 --> 36:53.046
You know, summer has always
been my favorite season.

36:55.189 --> 36:56.933
One more is good enough for me.

36:56.957 --> 36:59.569
Please, mama Lovin, please just
listen to what the doctor says.

36:59.593 --> 37:03.373
Oh, Toy, honey, come on now,
don't you go getting upset.

37:03.397 --> 37:06.943
Your baby can feel your sadness.

37:06.967 --> 37:11.214
And we don't have time for
one single sad minute.

37:11.238 --> 37:13.216
No.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.618
You know what?

37:15.642 --> 37:18.588
I would really like a milkshake.

37:18.612 --> 37:19.889
And a real one.

37:19.913 --> 37:22.059
Not one of those green ones.

37:22.083 --> 37:23.860
Come on, let's go.

37:23.884 --> 37:26.318
Thank you, Dr. Pittman.

37:31.725 --> 37:34.737
You have to tell Cara.

37:34.761 --> 37:38.108
She is just so tightly wound.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.377
And I don't want her
telling me what to do.

37:40.401 --> 37:41.778
But she's family.

37:41.802 --> 37:45.048
Have you told your family
about your baby yet?

37:45.072 --> 37:47.717
That's different.

37:47.741 --> 37:50.753
The only reason they'd care
is to remind themselves

37:50.777 --> 37:55.692
of why they don't
want me around.

37:55.716 --> 37:59.062
If you don't tell
her and she leaves

37:59.086 --> 38:01.965
she might not ever
see you again.

38:04.091 --> 38:06.570
I know, sweetheart.

38:06.594 --> 38:08.494
You're right.

38:13.767 --> 38:17.447
It almost feels
like I never left.

38:17.471 --> 38:19.282
Almost.

38:19.306 --> 38:21.466
Didn't I just see you wearing
high heels at the marina?

38:21.490 --> 38:23.086
Yeah.

38:23.110 --> 38:24.588
Yeah, I guess you did.

38:24.612 --> 38:25.688
Sure.

38:25.712 --> 38:27.672
You're never gonna let me
live that down, are you?

38:27.696 --> 38:28.774
Nope.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.095
Fair enough.

38:32.119 --> 38:35.832
You know, I almost
left a few years back.

38:35.856 --> 38:36.733
Really?

38:36.757 --> 38:38.001
Mmmhmm.

38:38.025 --> 38:40.303
I had it all planned out.

38:40.327 --> 38:42.972
After dad retired I
fixed the place up.

38:42.996 --> 38:44.608
Put the whole
business up for sale.

38:44.632 --> 38:46.009
I got some good offers, too.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.178
I bet you did.

38:48.202 --> 38:51.348
I just couldn't do it.

38:51.372 --> 38:54.117
It kind of turns out
I love this place.

38:54.141 --> 38:55.752
It's me, I guess.

38:55.776 --> 38:58.622
It is you.

38:58.646 --> 39:00.423
It was you once, too.

39:00.447 --> 39:01.447
No.

39:03.684 --> 39:08.865
I mean, I guess, but
summer's not real life.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.300
Is it?

39:10.324 --> 39:12.935
I don't know, I'm not
sure I'd say that.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.838
Declaration of Independence
came about in summer.

39:15.862 --> 39:16.939
Ok.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.175
The moon landing.

39:18.199 --> 39:19.509
Mmmhmm.

39:19.533 --> 39:23.046
Most importantly
Babe Ruth's 500.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.214
Home run.

39:24.238 --> 39:26.318
Wow, you're just a wealth
of information, aren't you?

39:26.342 --> 39:28.485
Yeah, I read a lot.

39:28.509 --> 39:32.556
Yeah, but comic
books don't count.

39:48.095 --> 39:50.574
<i>I didn't catch your name.</i>

39:50.598 --> 39:51.708
Russell.

39:51.732 --> 39:53.210
Bennett.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.100
Russell Bennett.

40:03.244 --> 40:07.524
I was just about to go
look for some new nests,

40:07.548 --> 40:10.159
if you'd like to come with me?

40:10.183 --> 40:12.618
I'll teach you
everything I know.

40:41.882 --> 40:43.882
Earth to mama.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.567
Where were you just then?

40:50.591 --> 40:55.438
Oh, just thinking about how
much I love this place.

40:55.462 --> 40:56.495
Mmm.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.866
It is really beautiful.

41:08.074 --> 41:12.589
Did you have a good
time with Brett?

41:12.613 --> 41:14.591
I did.

41:14.615 --> 41:17.627
You were gone a long time.

41:17.651 --> 41:19.117
Were we?

41:31.665 --> 41:34.110
Mama, is that Palmer?

41:34.134 --> 41:36.112
What is he doing here?

41:36.136 --> 41:41.117
And wearing his street
shoes in the sand.

41:41.141 --> 41:44.788
Oh, I swear that boy didn't
get a single one of my genes.

41:44.812 --> 41:45.812
Nope.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.027
These two parcels here,

41:51.051 --> 41:53.029
they were deeded to the
Coastal Conservatory,

41:53.053 --> 41:55.965
but this one right
here in the middle.

41:55.989 --> 41:57.467
I can't find a
transfer of title.

41:57.491 --> 42:01.103
At one point they were all
owned by the same person.

42:01.127 --> 42:04.563
Have you ever heard of someone
by the name of Russell Bennett?

42:07.033 --> 42:09.212
Yes. A long time ago.

42:09.236 --> 42:10.613
I figured you would.

42:10.637 --> 42:12.515
He was some kind of
marine biologist.

42:12.539 --> 42:14.451
Turtles were his thing.

42:14.475 --> 42:16.553
Why don't we go in the
house and have some tea

42:16.577 --> 42:20.189
and talk about something more
civilized than real estate?

42:20.213 --> 42:24.694
Mama, that's some
view you've got.

42:24.718 --> 42:26.963
It's the same view
she's always had.

42:26.987 --> 42:29.532
That spot that you saw
me out on the beach.

42:29.556 --> 42:31.368
I wanna buy that.

42:31.392 --> 42:32.335
What?

42:32.359 --> 42:34.203
Do you know how much
that property is worth?

42:34.227 --> 42:35.438
Flanked by protected beach?

42:35.462 --> 42:38.341
There isn't any more land to
develop up and down the coast.

42:38.365 --> 42:40.309
If I could just find
out who owns it.

42:40.333 --> 42:43.312
You sound just like your father.

42:43.336 --> 42:45.882
Always looking for more.

42:45.906 --> 42:50.442
Why can't you be satisfied
with what you've got?

42:54.347 --> 42:57.827
Actually, mama, I
could use the money.

42:57.851 --> 42:59.396
I mean, with the kids
and everything...

42:59.420 --> 43:00.997
She gave you the
house in Charleston.

43:01.021 --> 43:04.434
There's no mortgage on it.

43:04.458 --> 43:06.436
There is now.

43:06.460 --> 43:09.839
You borrowed against her house?

43:09.863 --> 43:11.441
Mama, did you agree to that?

43:11.465 --> 43:12.776
I don't understand, Palmer.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.877
That's exactly it, mama.

43:13.901 --> 43:15.244
You don't need to understand.

43:15.268 --> 43:16.946
I have all your
finances under control.

43:16.970 --> 43:18.490
But you said that you
don't have money.

43:18.514 --> 43:20.034
How are you gonna buy
the house if you-

43:20.058 --> 43:21.885
We're gonna sell this old place.

43:21.909 --> 43:23.349
As soon as I find
that chain of title

43:23.373 --> 43:24.521
I'm gonna buy that title,

43:24.545 --> 43:27.624
we're gonna put up some condos-
we're gonna make a fortune.

43:27.648 --> 43:29.726
Palmer, she loves this house.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.528
Look, this doesn't concern you.

43:31.552 --> 43:33.596
You walked out on us years ago.

43:33.620 --> 43:34.864
Well, I'm here now.

43:34.888 --> 43:35.832
Yeah?

43:35.856 --> 43:37.536
And how long before you
run back to Chicago

43:37.560 --> 43:38.868
for another 15 years, sis?

43:38.892 --> 43:39.702
Another day or two?

43:39.726 --> 43:41.471
Long enough to speak
up for my mother.

43:41.495 --> 43:45.074
I can speak for myself.

43:45.098 --> 43:47.977
My parents left me this house,

43:48.001 --> 43:49.779
and your father resented
it the whole time

43:49.803 --> 43:54.451
we were married
because it was mine.

43:54.475 --> 43:56.986
And it's the only
thing that was.

43:57.010 --> 43:58.988
When I couldn't take it anymore,

43:59.012 --> 44:01.257
the country club or
the cocktail parties

44:01.281 --> 44:02.659
for his business partners,

44:02.683 --> 44:05.462
this is where I would come.

44:05.486 --> 44:10.633
It is the only place I have
ever felt like myself.

44:10.657 --> 44:13.636
It is my home.

44:13.660 --> 44:16.895
And nobody's selling it.

44:30.711 --> 44:33.757
So, Brett Beauchamps, huh?

44:35.249 --> 44:36.560
What'd you tell her, mama?

44:36.584 --> 44:37.661
Nothing.

44:37.685 --> 44:40.831
Flo knows everything about
everyone on the island.

44:40.855 --> 44:43.867
Honey, I am faster
than the internet.

44:43.891 --> 44:45.502
Now, where were we?

44:45.526 --> 44:47.203
Brett.

44:47.227 --> 44:48.572
There's nothing to tell, Flo.

44:48.596 --> 44:50.707
That blush does not say nothing.

44:50.731 --> 44:54.944
It's not blush, it's...
it's a sunburn.

44:57.405 --> 45:00.406
And there he is
now, right on time.

45:07.314 --> 45:10.126
Good morning.

45:10.150 --> 45:11.862
Flowers.

45:11.886 --> 45:13.096
Lovie will be so happy.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.163
They're beautiful.

45:14.187 --> 45:16.254
Actually, they're for you.

45:20.127 --> 45:21.159
And a card.

45:23.163 --> 45:24.741
That's very sweet.

45:24.765 --> 45:25.898
Awe.

45:28.135 --> 45:30.368
That's so sweet.

45:32.005 --> 45:33.450
Uh, do you wanna get outta here?

45:33.474 --> 45:34.840
Yes.

45:36.944 --> 45:39.723
Ooh, summer love.

45:39.747 --> 45:42.893
I don't know if she believes
in that concept anymore.

45:42.917 --> 45:45.662
Who doesn't believe in love?

45:45.686 --> 45:47.731
I wasn't the best role model.

45:47.755 --> 45:52.636
Oh, you did your best.

45:52.660 --> 45:58.007
You're gonna have to tell
her before she leaves.

45:58.031 --> 46:00.098
I know.

46:22.823 --> 46:25.301
My humble abode.

46:25.325 --> 46:26.325
Go on.

46:30.197 --> 46:34.811
Yep, come a long way since that
apartment above the bait shop.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.513
Plus, it doesn't
smell like bait.

46:37.505 --> 46:38.515
No, it doesn't.

46:38.539 --> 46:39.571
Come on.

46:42.476 --> 46:45.121
My mom had one of those.

46:45.145 --> 46:46.322
She gave it to me.

46:46.346 --> 46:47.123
Did she?

46:47.147 --> 46:49.659
Mmmhmm.

46:49.683 --> 46:52.161
Nah, she's been a
good friend to me.

46:52.185 --> 46:53.864
You know, after the
last hurricane

46:53.888 --> 46:55.499
I thought I was gonna
go out of business.

46:55.523 --> 46:56.766
I probably would have, too,

46:56.790 --> 47:01.705
if it wasn't for her talking me
up to everyone on the island.

47:01.729 --> 47:03.807
Not to mention she stopped me

47:03.831 --> 47:05.475
from making a
really big mistake.

47:05.499 --> 47:06.499
Oh yeah?

47:08.368 --> 47:10.313
Go on.

47:10.337 --> 47:14.518
She sat me down, made
me a nice dinner,

47:14.542 --> 47:18.054
and she told me on not so
uncertain terms that my fiancé

47:18.078 --> 47:20.390
was completely wrong for me.

47:20.414 --> 47:22.926
You broke up because
of my mother?

47:22.950 --> 47:24.616
She was right.

47:27.021 --> 47:28.999
I'm sorry.

47:29.023 --> 47:33.670
I like to say I was blindsided
but actually I was relieved.

47:33.694 --> 47:36.372
I'm sure you would have
figured it out without Lovie.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.274
She did teach me
one thing, though.

47:38.298 --> 47:40.376
What's that?

47:40.400 --> 47:42.378
You gotta wait for
the right one.

47:42.402 --> 47:44.247
Huh.

47:44.271 --> 47:46.431
Isn't it all you boatmen who
say there's plenty of fish

47:46.455 --> 47:47.216
in the sea?

47:47.240 --> 47:48.251
Not me.

47:48.275 --> 47:48.952
Mmm-mmm.

47:48.976 --> 47:49.886
Huh.

47:49.910 --> 47:50.587
Really?

47:50.611 --> 47:52.055
Mmm-mmm.

47:52.079 --> 47:53.959
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that was on your website.

47:53.983 --> 47:55.692
You looked up my website.

47:55.716 --> 47:59.529
I mean, I might have for,
like, professional reasons.

47:59.553 --> 48:00.229
Of course, of course.

48:00.253 --> 48:01.798
I didn't assume anything else.

48:01.822 --> 48:04.434
But... but what did you think?

48:04.458 --> 48:05.702
Professionally, of course.

48:05.726 --> 48:09.973
Professionally speaking, I think
that you could probably use a...

48:09.997 --> 48:11.374
I don't know, a catch phrase.

48:11.398 --> 48:12.075
A catch phrase.

48:12.099 --> 48:12.809
Mmmhmm.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.377
Like what?

48:14.401 --> 48:17.246
Like something... memorable.

48:17.270 --> 48:20.149
My... my smile isn't enough?

48:20.841 --> 48:23.086
No, sadly, I don't think so.

48:23.110 --> 48:25.221
Ouch.

48:25.245 --> 48:27.079
I think something like um...

48:30.317 --> 48:32.596
"good things come
to those who bait".

48:35.299 --> 48:36.299
I like that.

48:36.323 --> 48:37.166
Thank you.

48:37.190 --> 48:38.735
It's on the house.
You can have that.

48:38.759 --> 48:39.970
Thank you.

48:39.994 --> 48:40.670
Thank you.

48:40.694 --> 48:41.237
Yeah.

48:41.261 --> 48:41.838
Cheers.

48:41.862 --> 48:42.894
Cheers.

48:43.931 --> 48:45.108
Good grip.

48:45.132 --> 48:45.642
There you go.

48:45.666 --> 48:47.911
Take down and roll.

48:47.935 --> 48:49.345
Take it down and roll.

48:49.369 --> 48:51.737
Ok, ok, I can do it.

49:00.114 --> 49:02.814
Maybe we could talk
about us, hmm?

49:04.217 --> 49:07.998
Look, I'm sure I could fall
for you all over again

49:08.022 --> 49:13.003
with that annoying southern
charm and those big blue eyes.

49:13.027 --> 49:13.703
Keep going.

49:13.727 --> 49:14.671
No, I like where this is going.

49:14.695 --> 49:15.805
Keep going.

49:15.829 --> 49:16.840
Mmmhmm.

49:16.864 --> 49:21.277
I just think we'll end
up where we did before.

49:21.301 --> 49:22.145
So...

49:22.169 --> 49:23.847
You might be right.

49:23.871 --> 49:26.950
Maybe this is who we
are supposed to be.

49:26.974 --> 49:32.956
Two people who run into
each other every few years.

49:32.980 --> 49:34.858
Take a magical boat ride.

49:34.882 --> 49:36.192
You dropped your towel.

49:36.216 --> 49:37.861
I know.

49:37.885 --> 49:39.484
I'll get it.

49:41.922 --> 49:44.500
But we'll never know if
you keep running away.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.569
I'm not running away.

49:46.593 --> 49:49.505
Your life is here
and mine's not.

49:49.529 --> 49:50.774
Mmmhmm.

49:50.798 --> 49:54.477
All I'm sayin' is maybe you're
just afraid to feel something.

49:54.501 --> 49:57.502
Because if you do you might
have to stick around.

50:06.446 --> 50:08.892
You were named
after the turtles.

50:08.916 --> 50:16.666
I know they migrate, too,
but they always come home.

50:16.690 --> 50:20.770
This isn't my home.

50:20.794 --> 50:23.795
It's just a place I
spent a few summers.

50:27.935 --> 50:28.967
Sorry.

50:30.237 --> 50:31.502
It's ok.

50:56.329 --> 50:59.364
Have a safe trip back, alright?

51:10.144 --> 51:11.777
Can we talk?

51:13.446 --> 51:16.447
Tell Lovie I'll be back to fix
the shutters after you leave.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.138
Oh my!

52:14.162 --> 52:15.205
Oh!

52:15.229 --> 52:16.773
Cara?

52:16.797 --> 52:18.475
Cara?!

52:18.499 --> 52:20.377
Oh, Cara, honey?

52:20.401 --> 52:22.612
Get out of the shower,
get dressed quick.

52:22.636 --> 52:23.313
What?

52:23.337 --> 52:25.249
I have something to show you.

52:25.273 --> 52:25.982
Right now?

52:26.006 --> 52:26.517
Yes, Cara, honey!

52:26.541 --> 52:27.739
Come on, right now!

52:31.622 --> 52:32.622
Oh, mom.

52:32.646 --> 52:34.391
You brought me out
here to see a turtle?

52:34.415 --> 52:35.575
I thought something happened.

52:35.599 --> 52:36.793
Something did, honey.

52:36.817 --> 52:38.795
Come look.

52:38.819 --> 52:44.134
Oh, you won't believe how rare
it is to see a mama Loggerhead.

52:44.158 --> 52:46.292
Honey, come sit.

52:49.763 --> 52:51.808
She's diggin' her nest.

52:51.832 --> 52:56.146
I saw her come up right
out of the ocean.

52:56.170 --> 53:00.317
In all my years I've only
seen it a couple of times.

53:00.341 --> 53:03.320
Oh, look.

53:03.344 --> 53:05.211
She's starting to lay.

53:07.615 --> 53:11.328
Mama, is she... crying?

53:11.352 --> 53:13.263
The scientists have
an explanation for it

53:13.287 --> 53:15.599
but I think she's cryin'.

53:15.623 --> 53:17.201
After she lays her eggs

53:17.225 --> 53:21.138
she'll make her way back to
the ocean and swim away.

53:21.162 --> 53:24.341
She won't be able
to protect them.

53:24.365 --> 53:27.177
She won't know if any
of them made it.

53:27.201 --> 53:32.316
And there's so many predators,
and the worst are humans.

53:32.340 --> 53:34.618
I had no idea.

53:34.642 --> 53:35.802
That's why we're all so nuts.

53:35.826 --> 53:36.720
Yeah.

53:36.744 --> 53:37.744
Us crazy turtle people.

53:39.880 --> 53:43.249
We're all she's got
in her corner.

53:49.723 --> 53:54.070
I am so lucky I got to see
you grow into a wonderful,

53:54.094 --> 53:56.640
strong woman.

53:56.664 --> 53:59.743
Mama, I'll come visit.

54:01.035 --> 54:04.181
A lot.

54:04.205 --> 54:06.082
I promise.

54:06.106 --> 54:08.185
What?

54:08.209 --> 54:11.388
I have been trying to think of
a easy way to tell you this

54:11.412 --> 54:12.922
and there just isn't one.

54:12.946 --> 54:14.112
What?

54:16.717 --> 54:20.497
I have cancer.

54:20.521 --> 54:22.098
What?

54:22.122 --> 54:24.901
It's terminal.

54:24.925 --> 54:26.370
No, mom.

54:26.394 --> 54:28.338
I can get you the best
doctors in Chicago.

54:28.362 --> 54:29.206
We can fight this.

54:29.230 --> 54:30.707
You're not gonna die.

54:30.731 --> 54:31.875
I know, Cara.

54:31.899 --> 54:32.842
I've tried all that.

54:32.866 --> 54:37.614
Honey, I've done all
the work, I know, I...

54:37.638 --> 54:38.649
Mama.

54:38.673 --> 54:42.886
All I want is for you to
stay a little longer.

54:42.910 --> 54:44.710
That's all I want.

54:50.751 --> 54:52.685
Mama.

54:55.789 --> 54:57.389
My baby.

55:17.845 --> 55:24.261
I don't understand why she's
not willing to fight this.

55:24.285 --> 55:26.796
Well, the doctor said um...

55:26.820 --> 55:30.834
it'll just slow down what's
already gonna happen.

55:30.858 --> 55:34.771
Believe me, I tried.

55:34.795 --> 55:38.908
She wants this last summer
the way she wants it.

55:38.932 --> 55:41.778
Last summer?

55:41.802 --> 55:48.852
Well, the doctor said that's
how long she has left.

55:48.876 --> 55:56.876
I don't know what we're
gonna do without her.

55:58.118 --> 56:02.832
Thank you for being
here with her.

56:02.856 --> 56:06.002
Well, you're here now.

56:06.026 --> 56:08.059
We both are.

56:12.132 --> 56:14.944
Oh dear.

56:14.968 --> 56:19.048
You two look like someone's
dying around here.

56:19.072 --> 56:20.450
Come on, now.

56:20.474 --> 56:23.553
We're gonna have none of that.

56:23.577 --> 56:27.524
We're gonna make this
the best summer yet.

56:27.548 --> 56:31.082
It already is, honey.

56:34.254 --> 56:37.467
I just picked the first bunch
of limes from my tree.

56:37.491 --> 56:38.835
Woo-hoo!

56:38.859 --> 56:41.871
Lovie pretends
they're for limeade

56:41.895 --> 56:44.908
but she really likes them
for her evening margaritas.

56:48.035 --> 56:50.980
Well, guess who I just ran
into down at the boat dock?

56:51.004 --> 56:53.016
Oooh, I bet I can guess.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.086
He doesn't seem as happy
as he was a few days ago.

56:57.110 --> 56:59.756
We kinda decided to end things.

56:59.780 --> 57:00.924
End things?

57:00.948 --> 57:02.225
But you just started.

57:02.249 --> 57:05.862
It's just easier this way, mama.

57:05.886 --> 57:08.164
Well, who said that
love was easy?

57:08.188 --> 57:09.822
I don't know.

57:11.502 --> 57:12.502
It's not love.

57:12.526 --> 57:13.837
Well, then what is it?

57:13.861 --> 57:15.439
I don't know.

57:15.463 --> 57:17.103
Maybe it's something
like your hatchlings,

57:17.127 --> 57:19.075
some make it to the
water, some don't.

57:19.099 --> 57:23.246
Well, they try like the
dickens to get there.

57:23.270 --> 57:26.082
Oh, honey.

57:26.106 --> 57:28.685
I just want you to be able to
give your heart to someone

57:28.709 --> 57:31.888
without being afraid
to have it broken.

57:31.912 --> 57:35.592
That's not what I'm afraid of.

57:35.616 --> 57:37.126
I get it.

57:37.150 --> 57:40.930
You don't wanna end up like me.

57:40.954 --> 57:44.368
And I don't blame you.

57:44.392 --> 57:50.407
Your father and I were not
a match made in heaven.

57:50.431 --> 57:53.599
But I do know what true love is.

58:01.509 --> 58:03.253
I'm sorry, mama Lovie.

58:03.277 --> 58:05.889
Oh, don't you worry
about that, honey.

58:05.913 --> 58:08.091
I should have torn
it down years ago.

58:08.115 --> 58:11.461
But you love sitting
on that swing.

58:11.485 --> 58:12.562
We can fix it.

58:12.586 --> 58:13.586
What?

58:14.755 --> 58:17.834
Girl, I am old as the hills
and she's big as a house.

58:20.227 --> 58:23.607
No you're not, and
we can do this.

58:23.631 --> 58:23.907
Ok.

58:23.931 --> 58:24.908
Right?

58:24.932 --> 58:26.443
We can do it.

58:26.467 --> 58:27.277
Give it to me.

58:27.301 --> 58:28.734
We can do it.

58:35.543 --> 58:36.553
Ok.

58:36.577 --> 58:40.123
And then will you forward
the rest of my mail?

58:40.147 --> 58:41.825
Thank you.

58:41.849 --> 58:44.994
And I'll let you know
when I'll be home.

58:45.018 --> 58:49.499
Now, I don't know what
is more surprising.

58:49.523 --> 58:54.704
Seeing you here or what the
heck is in that shopping cart.

58:54.728 --> 58:58.942
Uh... the pergola broke.

58:58.966 --> 59:00.844
Mmmhmm.

59:00.868 --> 59:03.313
And you thought you'd just fix
it on your way out of town?

59:03.337 --> 59:05.715
No, I meant to come and
tell you I wasn't leaving

59:05.739 --> 59:10.219
but um... I just...

59:10.243 --> 59:16.292
Hey, you alright?

59:16.316 --> 59:18.083
Lovie's sick.

59:21.655 --> 59:22.655
What?

59:26.093 --> 59:30.095
Um... I think she's dying.

59:33.266 --> 59:35.411
Oh, jeez, come here.

59:35.435 --> 59:36.468
I'm sorry.

59:39.874 --> 59:42.819
I am so sorry.

59:42.843 --> 59:45.922
I had no idea.

59:45.946 --> 59:47.078
I'm sorry.

59:48.081 --> 59:52.562
I just feel like I wasted so
many years being mad at her.

59:52.586 --> 59:53.997
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

59:54.021 --> 59:56.933
No, stop that. Stop that.

59:56.957 --> 59:58.702
You're here now.

59:58.726 --> 01:00:00.770
And that's what matters.

01:00:00.794 --> 01:00:03.529
I just feel so helpless.

01:00:23.617 --> 01:00:25.228
Hmm.

01:00:25.252 --> 01:00:27.463
It doesn't look that easy to me.

01:00:27.487 --> 01:00:30.099
We're just gonna need
some more tools.

01:00:30.123 --> 01:00:30.967
It's ok.

01:00:30.991 --> 01:00:32.636
Stand by, ladies.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.638
Flo has arrived.

01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:37.495
What is that?

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:42.145
Maybe this was a bad idea?

01:00:42.169 --> 01:00:44.948
If the wind doesn't blow
too hard we'll be fine.

01:00:44.972 --> 01:00:47.005
So, what next, ladies?

01:00:49.843 --> 01:00:50.954
Where are you going?

01:00:50.978 --> 01:00:51.955
<i>You'll see!</i>

01:00:51.979 --> 01:00:52.889
Cara?!

01:00:52.913 --> 01:00:54.157
Where are you off to?

01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:55.659
I don't know.

01:00:58.285 --> 01:01:00.129
Awe, look at you?

01:01:00.153 --> 01:01:01.965
Do you like it?

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:03.600
Oh my gosh.

01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:05.569
Our newest turtle lady.

01:01:05.593 --> 01:01:06.593
Yes.

01:01:07.585 --> 01:01:09.305
<i>Look at them, making
their way to the ocean.</i>

01:01:09.329 --> 01:01:10.339
<i>Here they come.</i>

01:01:12.032 --> 01:01:13.032
Come on!

01:01:16.837 --> 01:01:17.869
Awe.

01:01:18.872 --> 01:01:21.851
He's so cute.

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:23.152
My turtle girl.

01:01:23.176 --> 01:01:25.210
You're my turtle girl now.

01:01:27.648 --> 01:01:29.025
Here's another one.

01:01:29.049 --> 01:01:30.426
<i>Two more.</i>

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:31.450
<i>Oh my goodness.</i>

01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:35.821
Sixty-seven hatchlings.

01:01:37.691 --> 01:01:38.991
Not bad.

01:01:47.467 --> 01:01:49.045
Are you ok?

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:54.951
Yeah, just uh... wondering
if you're still gonna leave.

01:01:54.975 --> 01:01:57.721
With mama Lovie
like this and all.

01:01:57.745 --> 01:02:00.624
No, of course not.

01:02:00.648 --> 01:02:06.229
What about um...
you know, after?

01:02:06.253 --> 01:02:12.235
Well, I'll go back to Chicago,

01:02:12.259 --> 01:02:17.240
and come visit you and the
baby as much as possible.

01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:19.464
That'd be nice.

01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:29.019
Uh, I was in the neighborhood,
figured I'd finish her up.

01:02:29.043 --> 01:02:30.486
I hope you don't mind.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:34.090
Of course we don't
mind, do we, Cara?

01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:36.192
It's still a little wet, so...

01:02:36.216 --> 01:02:38.995
Oh, my Lady Bank roses.

01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:40.096
How did you know?

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:40.964
Uh, I didn't.

01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:43.099
The uh, nursery just
dropped them off.

01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:46.602
I ordered them, mama.

01:02:46.626 --> 01:02:48.705
You remembered, Cara.

01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:50.729
Of course I did.

01:02:53.466 --> 01:02:57.380
Well, we'll have 'em climbing
the pillars in no time.

01:02:57.404 --> 01:02:59.382
That sounds just wonderful.

01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:02.218
Maybe Cara will help you.

01:03:02.242 --> 01:03:04.854
Well, um, I've got an
appointment in town

01:03:04.878 --> 01:03:06.556
and you ladies-

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.058
An appointment for what?

01:03:08.082 --> 01:03:12.584
Oh, it's not a doctor,
don't you worry about it.

01:03:31.112 --> 01:03:33.425
Toy looks so pretty
in her new dress.

01:03:33.449 --> 01:03:35.126
It was sweet of you
to take her shopping.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.796
Oh, it was nothing.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.698
She looks beautiful.

01:03:39.722 --> 01:03:42.600
You know, I have a ton of
baby stuff up in the attic,

01:03:42.624 --> 01:03:44.035
I'm gonna send it right over.

01:03:44.059 --> 01:03:45.069
Oh no, I couldn't.

01:03:45.093 --> 01:03:46.504
Of course you could.

01:03:46.528 --> 01:03:48.272
I should have thought
of it sooner.

01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:49.907
Silly me.

01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:57.931
♪

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.586
I'm gonna go have a
little talk with Palmer.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:02.942
Ok.

01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:08.893
Come on, Aunt Cara.

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:09.949
Ok.

01:04:17.259 --> 01:04:18.970
Is Brett your boyfriend?

01:04:18.994 --> 01:04:19.937
What?

01:04:19.961 --> 01:04:21.172
No.

01:04:21.196 --> 01:04:23.174
Toy says you really
like each other.

01:04:23.198 --> 01:04:25.599
Well yeah, he's my friend.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.185
You're burning the chicken.

01:04:35.944 --> 01:04:38.456
Chicken's fine.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.524
Go talk to her.

01:04:39.548 --> 01:04:41.826
She's going to leave and
then how will you feel?

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:44.929
She left before and
I was just fine.

01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:46.130
Really?

01:04:46.154 --> 01:04:49.834
'Cause I remember you being
pretty torn apart back then.

01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:50.869
We were kids.

01:04:50.893 --> 01:04:52.003
Come on.

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:53.505
And now you're not.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.008
You know, Flo, you bring
a whole new meaning

01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:58.209
to the term "grilling".

01:04:58.233 --> 01:04:59.343
Oh, please.

01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:01.212
Alright, who's hungry?

01:05:01.236 --> 01:05:04.282
Food is on.

01:05:04.306 --> 01:05:06.684
Linnea and Cooper are
having so much fun.

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:07.652
Yeah, they are.

01:05:07.676 --> 01:05:11.222
You should bring them
out here more often.

01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:13.157
Their sports and music.

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:15.560
Their schedules are
busier than mine.

01:05:15.584 --> 01:05:18.396
Besides, you'll be seeing
plenty of them in Charleston.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.699
Mom, the house looks great.

01:05:21.723 --> 01:05:23.401
I see you got your
roses back, too.

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:24.702
It's good curb appeal.

01:05:24.726 --> 01:05:26.404
Curb appeal.

01:05:26.428 --> 01:05:27.839
Yeah.

01:05:27.863 --> 01:05:30.341
To sell the house.

01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:31.765
Did you forget what
we talked about?

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:32.877
Apparently you did.

01:05:32.901 --> 01:05:35.012
Don't get your feathers ruffled.

01:05:35.036 --> 01:05:36.648
Besides, you have your
whole family all together,

01:05:36.672 --> 01:05:37.582
just the way you like us.

01:05:37.606 --> 01:05:39.584
I didn't wanna bring
this up at the party

01:05:39.608 --> 01:05:43.521
but I went down to the
bank to see Mr. Davis.

01:05:43.545 --> 01:05:45.590
Why would you bother doing that?

01:05:45.614 --> 01:05:49.026
I wanted to understand
my financial situation.

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:52.029
Mama, that's what
you have me for.

01:05:52.053 --> 01:05:56.523
Mr. Davis gave me all
the time I needed.

01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:06.210
What he couldn't explain is why
there are so many withdrawals

01:06:06.234 --> 01:06:10.949
from my account that
I never received.

01:06:10.973 --> 01:06:12.517
You're gonna get it all back.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:13.821
I can tell you
where every penny-

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:18.222
I don't want it back and you
don't even have to explain.

01:06:18.246 --> 01:06:20.959
But I did ask Mr. Davis to
transfer the rest of my funds

01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:23.561
into a new account
which I will tend to.

01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:24.662
What?

01:06:24.686 --> 01:06:27.398
You haven't written a check
yourself in 20 years.

01:06:27.422 --> 01:06:30.768
If I have any problems,
which I won't,

01:06:30.792 --> 01:06:33.872
Cara has always had a
fine head for numbers.

01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:36.608
I get it.

01:06:36.632 --> 01:06:39.577
She waltzes back down here after
umpteen years of being gone,

01:06:39.601 --> 01:06:41.613
figures out the price of
real estate down here-

01:06:41.637 --> 01:06:42.647
Palmer, stop.

01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:43.548
Dollars to doughnuts she
starts coming down here

01:06:43.572 --> 01:06:45.316
every summer to get
back to her roots-

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.951
That won't be happening!

01:06:46.975 --> 01:06:47.652
I'll put money on it.

01:06:47.676 --> 01:06:50.121
Because I am not gonna be here.

01:06:50.145 --> 01:06:52.323
What?

01:06:52.347 --> 01:06:54.280
Where are you gonna go?

01:06:58.253 --> 01:06:59.731
Son.

01:06:59.755 --> 01:07:00.999
Mama, what?

01:07:01.023 --> 01:07:03.523
I have cancer.

01:07:06.962 --> 01:07:08.172
What're you sayin'?

01:07:08.196 --> 01:07:11.475
I'm really sorry, Palmer.

01:07:11.499 --> 01:07:17.281
There aren't gonna
be anymore summers.

01:07:17.305 --> 01:07:18.917
I'm sorry, son.

01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:20.941
Mama, no.

01:07:32.821 --> 01:07:35.266
Linnea, Cooper, Julia, let's go.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:36.200
What? Babe?

01:07:36.224 --> 01:07:36.868
Palmer.

01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:37.924
Palmer?

01:07:42.497 --> 01:07:45.131
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.
In the car.

01:07:46.668 --> 01:07:49.669
Palmer, honey, are you ok?

01:07:56.511 --> 01:07:58.912
Mama, are you ok?

01:08:02.484 --> 01:08:04.862
Oh, uh... he is
such a fragile boy.

01:08:04.886 --> 01:08:05.763
You told him.

01:08:05.787 --> 01:08:07.665
Oh, I should have
done it right away.

01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:10.401
That's what you would have done.

01:08:10.425 --> 01:08:14.072
You've always been
upfront about things.

01:08:14.096 --> 01:08:15.128
Not always.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:22.680
My big life in Chicago?

01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:25.515
I kinda fell apart.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.218
Baby.

01:08:27.242 --> 01:08:29.020
I lost my job.

01:08:29.044 --> 01:08:32.724
Oh, but you are such a star.

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:36.493
Well, apparently I've
been out-shined.

01:08:36.518 --> 01:08:37.877
You know, all these
years I thought

01:08:37.902 --> 01:08:39.142
I was running towards something

01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:41.532
but I think I've
been running away.

01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:44.335
You've accomplished so much.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.772
Maybe on the outside.

01:08:47.796 --> 01:08:49.515
But on the inside I've
been keeping everyone

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.111
at arm's length.

01:08:53.135 --> 01:08:55.947
I thought I was
being independent.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.685
One day you'll look back at your
life and it'll all be clear.

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:05.145
The only problem is, sometimes
you realize it too late.

01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:21.604
Oh no, no, no.

01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:22.473
Go back!

01:09:22.497 --> 01:09:23.808
What's happening?

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:24.642
They're confused.

01:09:24.666 --> 01:09:26.106
They're going in the
wrong direction.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.975
They're supposed to go towards
the reflection of the moon

01:09:27.999 --> 01:09:28.912
on the ocean.

01:09:28.937 --> 01:09:30.017
It's that house back there.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:33.951
Somebody tell those fools
to cut their lights off!

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:36.386
Let's just block
the light for now.

01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:38.288
Just drop down.

01:09:38.313 --> 01:09:39.622
Get real close together.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:41.091
What do we do?

01:09:41.116 --> 01:09:41.959
Go back.

01:09:41.983 --> 01:09:43.460
Get closer so they
don't go through.

01:09:43.484 --> 01:09:45.429
Ok, where is he?

01:09:45.453 --> 01:09:46.430
Oh, there he is.

01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:46.997
How are we gonna-

01:09:47.022 --> 01:09:48.933
Come on, go, go, go, go.

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:50.167
There's your light.

01:09:50.192 --> 01:09:50.600
Who is that?

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:51.736
Uh, it's Brett.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.239
We called him when we first
noticed these hatchlings.

01:09:55.263 --> 01:09:56.674
See the light.

01:09:56.698 --> 01:09:58.309
They're turning around. Yes.

01:09:58.333 --> 01:09:59.143
Oh, it's working!

01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:00.678
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:10:00.702 --> 01:10:03.081
There you go.

01:10:03.105 --> 01:10:06.184
There you go.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:09.687
It worked.

01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:11.322
Just in the nick of time.

01:10:11.346 --> 01:10:12.523
Oh, he's taking off.

01:10:12.547 --> 01:10:14.525
Go! Go!

01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:15.982
Go, babies.

01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:34.078
To what do I owe the
honor of this visit?

01:10:34.102 --> 01:10:36.246
Come and see her.

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.215
At least call.

01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:41.185
I'm sure you've got
everything under control.

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:43.687
That's what you're
good at, right?

01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:45.322
Y'all don't need me.

01:10:45.346 --> 01:10:48.359
Mama made that clear as crystal.

01:10:48.383 --> 01:10:50.694
What's gotten into you?

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:51.661
She's sick-

01:10:51.685 --> 01:10:55.099
No. No, you don't get
to go there, Cara.

01:10:55.123 --> 01:10:56.867
Who do you think's been
here all those years

01:10:56.891 --> 01:10:57.734
when you just waltzed off, huh?

01:10:57.758 --> 01:10:59.703
I know.

01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:02.239
And I'm sorry.

01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:05.542
If I could change
the past I would.

01:11:05.566 --> 01:11:07.577
Really?

01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:10.614
Would you?

01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:12.849
What about leaving me here
to deal with him, huh?

01:11:12.873 --> 01:11:16.686
Would you do that again?

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.756
I used to be so proud of you.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.860
'Cause nobody could stand
up to him like you.

01:11:23.884 --> 01:11:26.363
God knows I couldn't.

01:11:26.387 --> 01:11:28.965
And if I couldn't then mama
definitely couldn't but you,

01:11:28.989 --> 01:11:31.657
you looked that old
man right in his eye.

01:11:34.728 --> 01:11:38.409
Ain't that right, daddy?

01:11:38.433 --> 01:11:39.713
She could tell you
all the things

01:11:39.737 --> 01:11:44.048
we were too scared to say.

01:11:44.072 --> 01:11:46.083
'Til one day you
just up and leave.

01:11:46.107 --> 01:11:48.740
Leave mom and I here
holding the bag.

01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:56.493
I don't wanna fight with you.

01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:58.184
She needs you.

01:12:23.043 --> 01:12:24.710
Well, hey there!

01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:28.459
Hey, Lovie.

01:12:28.483 --> 01:12:29.723
The rain's due in hard tonight.

01:12:29.747 --> 01:12:33.363
Figured I'd get these closed
up for you before it hits.

01:12:33.387 --> 01:12:36.633
What would we do without
you around here?

01:12:36.657 --> 01:12:39.369
Cara will be back soon in
case you're wondering.

01:12:39.393 --> 01:12:40.337
Yeah.

01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:42.041
The only thing I'm
thinkin' about right now

01:12:42.065 --> 01:12:45.041
is keeping you out of the
rain, keeping you dry.

01:12:45.065 --> 01:12:46.042
Hey, Toy.

01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:48.812
Oh, hey.

01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:50.947
Not another one of these.

01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:53.150
Come on, we have a deal.

01:12:53.174 --> 01:12:55.619
Do they get better?

01:12:55.643 --> 01:12:57.020
They don't.

01:12:57.044 --> 01:12:58.644
You have your doctor's
appointment today,

01:12:58.668 --> 01:13:00.690
I'll be happy to take you.

01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.692
I'm taking the bus today.

01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:04.328
Why?

01:13:04.352 --> 01:13:06.497
It's just a check-up.

01:13:06.521 --> 01:13:08.499
But there's that storm comin'.

01:13:08.523 --> 01:13:10.534
I've been through
a storm or two.

01:13:10.558 --> 01:13:13.003
Besides, if I can't take care
of myself for one afternoon

01:13:13.027 --> 01:13:15.339
how am I gonna take
care of a baby?

01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:16.373
Good point.

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:17.974
You just be careful.

01:13:17.998 --> 01:13:19.976
Hello ladies.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:20.910
Hey, Flo.

01:13:20.934 --> 01:13:21.745
Hey.

01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:23.813
Oh, not again.

01:13:23.837 --> 01:13:24.515
Want some?

01:13:24.539 --> 01:13:25.482
No.

01:13:25.506 --> 01:13:27.184
It gets in your teeth
a little bit, but...

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.485
I'll get you an iced tea.

01:13:28.509 --> 01:13:29.509
Thank you.

01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:44.768
Can I help you?

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:46.603
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm
in the right place.

01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:47.787
I'm looking for Cara Rudland.

01:13:47.811 --> 01:13:48.931
Uh, yeah, this is the place.

01:13:48.955 --> 01:13:49.739
She's out.

01:13:49.763 --> 01:13:50.674
Oh, man.

01:13:50.698 --> 01:13:52.298
Well, would you mind
if I waited for her?

01:13:52.322 --> 01:13:53.467
I'm a friend from Chicago.

01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:54.733
Richard Devries.

01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:57.113
Richard.

01:13:57.137 --> 01:13:58.282
Brett.

01:13:58.306 --> 01:14:02.386
Brett, are you the handyman
around here or something?

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:03.420
Or somethin'.

01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:04.354
Ok.

01:14:04.378 --> 01:14:06.290
Richard?

01:14:06.314 --> 01:14:07.257
What're you doing here?

01:14:07.281 --> 01:14:08.225
Hey.

01:14:08.249 --> 01:14:10.561
You didn't return my calls.

01:14:10.585 --> 01:14:12.596
I wanted to come in person.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.297
Brett, this is-

01:14:13.321 --> 01:14:15.965
Richard. We met.

01:14:15.989 --> 01:14:17.234
Yeah.

01:14:17.258 --> 01:14:19.736
Can we go somewhere
and talk, please?

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.271
Unless you got plans.

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:22.695
No plans here.

01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:31.315
Uh, tell Lovie I'm done
with the shutters.

01:14:31.339 --> 01:14:33.004
Thank you.

01:14:34.675 --> 01:14:37.053
You seem different.

01:14:37.077 --> 01:14:39.889
I am different.

01:14:39.913 --> 01:14:44.328
Well, whatever it is,
you look beautiful.

01:14:44.352 --> 01:14:47.464
You didn't come all the way
down here to flatter me.

01:14:47.488 --> 01:14:48.528
That's one of the reasons.

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:50.066
What's the other reason?

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.102
Look, I know you're mad.

01:14:52.126 --> 01:14:53.637
I should have told you I
was getting promoted.

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:54.971
You didn't just get promoted.

01:14:54.995 --> 01:14:56.005
You got my promotion-

01:14:56.029 --> 01:14:57.608
I'm sorry about that.

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.676
But look, that's
all in the past.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.245
We got the Barclay account.

01:15:01.269 --> 01:15:03.179
We got your baby.

01:15:03.203 --> 01:15:06.149
And I let the partners know
that it was all because of you.

01:15:06.173 --> 01:15:09.620
And they want you
back as a senior VP

01:15:09.644 --> 01:15:11.622
and group director
of the account.

01:15:11.646 --> 01:15:14.280
With a salary commensurate
with all of that.

01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:20.897
My mom is sick.

01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:23.833
I wouldn't be able to start
for a while, anyway. I can't.

01:15:23.857 --> 01:15:26.136
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.604
But look, we'll wait.

01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:30.874
Take all the time you need.

01:15:30.898 --> 01:15:34.043
But you know there's another
reason I'm here, too.

01:15:34.067 --> 01:15:35.812
It's because I miss you.

01:15:35.836 --> 01:15:37.947
I really do.

01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:41.351
I want it in writing.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.919
How much I miss you?

01:15:42.943 --> 01:15:44.343
The offer.

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:53.664
There's a storm coming in.

01:15:53.688 --> 01:15:55.688
You should leave now.

01:16:28.389 --> 01:16:32.391
<i>Sarah? Sarah, ok you're next.</i>

01:16:37.765 --> 01:16:40.009
Excuse me, hi.

01:16:40.033 --> 01:16:42.393
Um, do you know how much longer
until the doctor can see me?

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:44.047
When are you due?

01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:45.615
Uh, not for another three weeks.

01:16:45.639 --> 01:16:46.483
I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:16:46.507 --> 01:16:47.907
You'll have to wait
with the others.

01:16:47.931 --> 01:16:48.875
It's a crazy day.

01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:50.676
I need to get home.

01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:32.829
<i>Another hurricane has arrived in
the low country of South Carolina.</i>

01:17:32.853 --> 01:17:35.999
<i>Just in the last couple of
hour rain falling sideways</i>

01:17:36.023 --> 01:17:38.301
<i>and winds gusting over
40 miles an hour.</i>

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:41.170
<i>Today was the last day
to prep or get out.</i>

01:17:41.194 --> 01:17:43.106
<i>Tonight South Carolina
counting the hours</i>

01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:45.130
<i>until what could
be a direct hit.</i>

01:17:54.952 --> 01:17:55.952
Mama, what're you doing?

01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:56.820
Have you packed your bags?

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:57.721
We gotta go!

01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:59.155
Oh honey, I'm not leaving.

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:00.624
Mom, it's a full-on hurricane.

01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:02.292
We're the last ones here.

01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:03.393
Your father, your brother,

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:06.029
everyone is trying to get
me out of this beach house.

01:18:06.053 --> 01:18:09.165
Oh honey, I have been
through so many hurricanes.

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:11.902
And this is just a
little tropical storm.

01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:15.305
I'm not goin'.

01:18:15.329 --> 01:18:16.569
If you're staying, I'm staying.

01:18:16.593 --> 01:18:17.373
Cara.

01:18:17.397 --> 01:18:18.877
Mama, don't try and
talk me out of it,

01:18:18.901 --> 01:18:20.734
you know how stubborn I am.

01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:25.582
Toy Sooner?

01:18:25.606 --> 01:18:26.638
Toy Sooner?

01:18:35.715 --> 01:18:38.261
I mean, they're offering
to double my salary

01:18:38.285 --> 01:18:40.163
plus stock options.

01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:42.198
Wow.

01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:45.735
Pretty much everything
I ever wanted.

01:18:45.759 --> 01:18:48.204
Congratulations.

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.188
If this were a week ago I'd
be mentally decorating

01:18:50.212 --> 01:18:52.408
my office right now.

01:18:52.432 --> 01:18:54.578
Well, you can
decorate in person.

01:18:54.602 --> 01:18:55.602
Yeah.

01:18:58.138 --> 01:19:00.584
Mama, shouldn't Toy
be back by now?

01:19:00.608 --> 01:19:01.918
Maybe I should go look for her.

01:19:01.942 --> 01:19:03.286
You'll do no such thing.

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:04.521
She'll be fine.

01:19:04.545 --> 01:19:07.791
She's a smart girl, I'm sure
she just stayed at the clinic.

01:19:07.815 --> 01:19:10.549
No, no, no, no, no!

01:19:13.387 --> 01:19:15.098
Hey Lovie, it's me.

01:19:15.122 --> 01:19:16.099
I'm on my way.

01:19:16.123 --> 01:19:17.100
I'm just worried about you.

01:19:17.124 --> 01:19:18.423
See you soon.

01:19:28.301 --> 01:19:30.213
<i>Lovie!</i>

01:19:30.237 --> 01:19:31.280
<i>Lovie!</i>

01:19:31.304 --> 01:19:32.838
It's Flo!

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:40.524
Here let me help you.

01:19:40.548 --> 01:19:44.460
I broke the law but the
tide was washing them away.

01:19:44.484 --> 01:19:45.328
What're you talking about?

01:19:45.352 --> 01:19:47.664
Oh, she removed the
eggs from the nest.

01:19:47.688 --> 01:19:50.767
It's illegal, we'll put
them back afterwards.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:52.435
Let 'em arrest us, right Flo?

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:54.059
You got that right.

01:20:05.806 --> 01:20:07.238
Toy?

01:20:11.946 --> 01:20:14.580
Toy, you ok?

01:20:29.997 --> 01:20:32.208
Well, Caretta, this is
quite the adventure.

01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:33.877
That's one way of putting it.

01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:37.447
Oh, this old cottage has
been through worse.

01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:40.283
And so have we.

01:20:40.307 --> 01:20:42.819
I'm sorry for the way I
left back then, mama.

01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:44.821
Oh honey, don't be.

01:20:44.845 --> 01:20:48.291
I have always loved your
spirit and your backbone.

01:20:48.315 --> 01:20:51.495
Ever since you were
a little girl.

01:20:51.519 --> 01:20:56.833
I wanted to see you fly as
far, as high as you could.

01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:59.525
I wanted that for you
as much as you did.

01:21:09.202 --> 01:21:11.603
<i>Do you believe in soulmates?</i>

01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:17.587
I'm skeptical.

01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:21.491
I know it's silly, I used to not
believe in that stuff, either.

01:21:21.515 --> 01:21:24.594
Until I met Russell Bennett.

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:27.597
I thought there was
more to that story.

01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:33.403
Back then the dunes stretched
as far as the eye could see.

01:21:33.427 --> 01:21:35.672
There was no development.

01:21:35.696 --> 01:21:41.511
The ocean, the salt air, our
turtles and each other.

01:21:41.535 --> 01:21:44.013
It was only a summer but
we spent every minute

01:21:44.037 --> 01:21:49.352
we could together without
causin' people to talk.

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:51.354
Why would people talk?

01:21:51.378 --> 01:21:53.256
He had a fiancé.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.459
He had made a commitment
and I could see the agony

01:21:55.483 --> 01:22:00.764
that it caused him
so I stepped away.

01:22:00.788 --> 01:22:02.632
Did he marry her?

01:22:02.656 --> 01:22:03.800
I got a letter from him.

01:22:03.824 --> 01:22:06.870
He said that he was flying
to her house to break it off

01:22:06.894 --> 01:22:09.806
in person.

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:11.708
What happened?

01:22:11.732 --> 01:22:14.377
His plane went down
over the ocean.

01:22:14.401 --> 01:22:16.480
Engine failure.

01:22:16.504 --> 01:22:18.482
Ah, mama.

01:22:18.506 --> 01:22:23.286
When your father came along
I was still numb inside.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.511
A part of me had died.

01:22:42.329 --> 01:22:47.343
This is the deed to a parcel
of land that Russell left me.

01:22:47.367 --> 01:22:50.346
It was gonna be my
wedding present.

01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.649
It's the dunes in
front of the house

01:22:52.673 --> 01:22:55.819
where the turtles
lay their eggs.

01:22:55.843 --> 01:22:58.354
I want you to have
it, sweetheart.

01:22:58.378 --> 01:23:00.356
And this house, too.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.425
They're yours now.

01:23:02.449 --> 01:23:07.096
I just hope you come to
find that the beach house

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:13.124
is not so much a place
as a state of mind.

01:24:10.718 --> 01:24:12.528
Oh my goodness, Toy!

01:24:12.552 --> 01:24:14.698
We were just gonna come
look for you, honey.

01:24:14.722 --> 01:24:15.865
You had the baby!

01:24:15.889 --> 01:24:17.533
Are you alright?

01:24:17.557 --> 01:24:19.903
Yeah, we're ok.

01:24:19.927 --> 01:24:22.438
Brett took me to the hospital
and spent the entire night

01:24:22.462 --> 01:24:23.372
in a chair.

01:24:23.396 --> 01:24:25.075
Yeah, and she should
still be there, too.

01:24:25.099 --> 01:24:27.132
Practically fought her way out.

01:24:30.537 --> 01:24:32.097
Look, I'm gonna go
check out your place,

01:24:32.121 --> 01:24:33.754
see how she held up.

01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:36.519
Come on.

01:24:36.543 --> 01:24:37.621
Mama.

01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:38.554
Palmer.

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:40.211
I couldn't get through.

01:24:41.381 --> 01:24:42.692
I had to make sure you were ok.

01:24:42.716 --> 01:24:46.229
Oh, it was just a little
old tropical storm.

01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:47.196
You made it through another one.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.599
Of course I did.

01:24:49.623 --> 01:24:51.801
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:53.436
I'm sorry.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:53.937
I...

01:24:53.961 --> 01:24:55.605
Oh honey, it's ok.

01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:57.807
I should have been here for you.

01:24:57.831 --> 01:24:59.109
I love you.

01:24:59.133 --> 01:25:01.166
Oh, I love you.

01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:13.757
Well, I think I can
salvage most of it.

01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:18.561
You know, southern ladies do
need their pergola and roses.

01:25:18.585 --> 01:25:21.330
We do, don't we?

01:25:21.354 --> 01:25:22.398
We?

01:25:22.422 --> 01:25:23.422
Uh-huh.

01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:28.860
I'm not leaving.

01:25:31.965 --> 01:25:38.414
I'm sorry, I... you
mean like, today?

01:25:38.438 --> 01:25:41.317
I mean like ever.

01:25:41.341 --> 01:25:43.408
This is my home right here.

01:25:56.389 --> 01:25:58.001
Lovie always said I'd
look around one day

01:25:58.025 --> 01:26:00.036
and I would know what was right.

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.105
Mmmhmm.

01:26:02.129 --> 01:26:04.062
This is right.

01:27:08.896 --> 01:27:10.206
There you go, mama.

01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:12.864
Oh thank you, baby.

01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:27.290
It's been such a
nice summer, Cara.

01:27:27.314 --> 01:27:30.059
It's been the best.

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.917
You're a good mama.

01:27:34.721 --> 01:27:36.432
I love you.

01:27:36.456 --> 01:27:38.489
I love you, sweetheart.

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:49.112
You know, um... I
feel a little chilly.

01:27:49.136 --> 01:27:50.814
If you could just
get me a blanket.

01:27:50.838 --> 01:27:51.870
Of course.

01:29:30.003 --> 01:29:31.014
Hurry!

01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:33.149
You gonna let an old
lady go faster than you?

01:29:36.343 --> 01:29:37.343
<i>Look!</i>

01:29:43.216 --> 01:29:46.162
Woah, cool!

01:29:46.186 --> 01:29:47.496
Mama Lovie would
have loved this.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.520
Oh, wow.

01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:54.337
Do you guys remember the
scientific name for turtles?

01:29:54.361 --> 01:29:55.361
Caretta.

01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:59.943
Look, there's another one.

01:29:59.967 --> 01:30:02.000
There's gonna be
a bunch of them.

01:30:05.572 --> 01:30:08.406
Well, here's to a beautiful
summer together.

01:30:09.576 --> 01:30:12.021
A lot can happen in the summer.

01:30:12.045 --> 01:30:15.524
Births, loss...

01:30:15.548 --> 01:30:17.293
Hurricanes.

01:30:17.317 --> 01:30:20.063
Turtles.

01:30:20.087 --> 01:30:21.364
Love.

01:30:21.388 --> 01:30:22.365
What?

01:30:22.389 --> 01:30:23.599
You're in love?

01:30:23.623 --> 01:30:25.134
Anyone I know?

01:30:25.158 --> 01:30:28.371
Just some guy who
likes barbecue sauce.

01:30:28.395 --> 01:30:31.074
Sounds like quite a catch.

01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:32.098
He is.

01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:37.035
Comer here.

01:31:05.965 --> 01:31:08.233
