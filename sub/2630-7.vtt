00:05.463 --> 00:07.381
Are you looking
at naked tribeswomen?

00:07.882 --> 00:10.009
No, look.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.344
That's a pig.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.347
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

00:19.227 --> 00:20.894
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.063
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.523
- What?
- Why?

00:24.733 --> 00:27.359
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

00:27.569 --> 00:31.822
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.532
Didn't you sign a lease?

00:33.700 --> 00:36.201
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

00:37.620 --> 00:40.706
You can stay with us.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.332
Anything you need.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.419
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

00:45.628 --> 00:47.421
...so we can make fun of your hair.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.300
- You got it.
- Okay.

00:51.468 --> 00:56.221
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.933
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.105
- What?
- He thought you said gonad.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.579
Wow, Monica. If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.665
Ha, oh, Larry!

02:05.375 --> 02:07.751
Um, do health inspectors
work on commission?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.377
No, bribes.

02:09.586 --> 02:12.673
- Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
- I was just kidding.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.844
- I'll check the kitchen floor.
- Knock yourself out.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.389
Yummy! Heh.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.516
Larry?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.560
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.440
A 98.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.485
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.529
That is a Section 5 violation.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.699
Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.577
Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.371
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.249
- Where's your hat?
- In the kitchen. I'll get it.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.085
Ah, there's the two points!

02:51.796 --> 02:54.590
You should really read
that book you wrote.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.638
Wow.

03:01.848 --> 03:06.852
You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew
she'd go in hatless to get it, heh.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.480
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.025
Ah, I don't know about that.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.903
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda, heh.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.115
Maybe, uh, I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.367
She would love that...

03:22.702 --> 03:25.829
...since you know
all the clean places to eat, heh.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.415
I'll call you.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.209
Okay.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.632
He's so funny! Whoa, oh.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.015
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.894
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.563
He's not great.
But, um, he's dealing with it.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.232
- Oh.
- Wait, you're not...

03:53.399 --> 03:57.361
Oh, I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.155
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

04:00.365 --> 04:04.076
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.704
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.712
- Two pounds of mocha java.
- It's Danny.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.339
Are you going to go out again?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.300
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.594
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all...

04:24.722 --> 04:26.431
...and then nothing.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.850
- Hey.
- Hi, Danny.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.310
Wow, thirsty, huh?

04:30.520 --> 04:34.022
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.732
- Oh, fun.
- Oh, great!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.734
- Really looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.444
See you!

04:43.866 --> 04:46.827
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.162
Oh, ha, ha, okay.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.873
All right, I see what he's doing.

04:52.083 --> 04:56.169
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.504
And you won't do that.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.089
That's right!

04:59.340 --> 05:02.384
Because that would give him
the control.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.762
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

05:06.014 --> 05:08.640
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.767
Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.895
So there is no party?

05:14.063 --> 05:17.941
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.651
But the power?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.029
That is still up for grabs.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.239
You follow me?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.741
I think so.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.870
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

05:30.079 --> 05:31.288
Exactly!

05:40.673 --> 05:42.090
Ross?

05:42.633 --> 05:45.135
Hey, roomies!

05:46.512 --> 05:48.096
I love what you've done
with the place.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.682
Oh, I know it's a lot of boxes.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.853
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- Not a problem.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.147
Since you'll be here a while...

05:57.357 --> 06:00.359
...we, uh, could put your name
on the answering machine.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.486
Oh, I, uh, hope you don't mind...

06:02.695 --> 06:06.073
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.158
Check it out.

06:13.748 --> 06:18.335
We will
We will call you back

06:20.713 --> 06:22.214
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Oh, yes.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.386
- You're fake laughing too, right?
- The tears are real.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.762
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.518
- You look beautiful this evening.
- Heh.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.686
Show me the badge again.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.361
Shiny, ha, ha.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.615
Oh, you mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.951
You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!

07:01.838 --> 07:03.588
- We're out of here.
- Why?

07:03.798 --> 07:07.676
I saw ten violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

07:07.885 --> 07:11.513
- You have the power to do that?
- This does.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.099
Shut it down.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.903
Hey.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.865
What are you doing?

07:30.741 --> 07:32.033
Nothing.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.203
You built a fort, didn't you?

07:37.915 --> 07:39.416
Kind of, heh.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.170
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.380
All I heard for four years
through college was...

07:48.759 --> 07:50.760
You should have gone out
once in a while.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.181
- I hate this thing!
- Come on, Chandler.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.017
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.479
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

08:06.360 --> 08:07.903
- Oh, hi, Danny.
- Hey, guys.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.821
Uh, I wanted to invite you to the party.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.073
Oh, thanks, I'll try to stop by.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.869
Actually, I think, ahem,
I'm going to be busy.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.287
You are?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.663
Yeah.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.166
Remember? I've got that, uh, gala.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.628
What's the gala for?

08:24.795 --> 08:26.254
Uh, it's a, um...

08:26.422 --> 08:28.715
It's, uh, a regatta gala.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.675
Do you sail?

08:30.885 --> 08:33.720
No, but I support it.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.974
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.851
Okay.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.190
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

08:45.399 --> 08:46.650
What one?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.569
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.864
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

08:53.074 --> 08:56.868
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.411
But I said no...

08:58.621 --> 09:01.456
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.084
So the ball is in his court?

09:04.293 --> 09:05.377
Ball?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.462
No, there's no ball.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.849
Joey, please.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.810
Sorry.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.328
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.415
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.209
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.255
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes, ha, ha.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.132
Come on!

09:57.805 --> 09:59.639
I have one question.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.726
What is the deal with this?

10:03.352 --> 10:06.605
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.898
No, the quiet down thing.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.443
Oh. You mean this.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.403
Mm-hm.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.032
I don't know how much more
I can take.

10:17.241 --> 10:21.328
Did you know he taped over my
Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.623
My God!

10:24.790 --> 10:26.166
- What if that had been porn?
- Oh!

10:28.210 --> 10:30.086
All right, this may be tough...

10:30.296 --> 10:32.881
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.343
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.720
- Let's have a game.
- Okay.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.389
Don't be scored on. No, no, no.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.809
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.019
Uh, fellas?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.486
- So he's out of here.
- Mm-hm.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.868
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:02.036 --> 11:06.122
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

11:06.332 --> 11:10.877
Oh, I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.840
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.759
I don't know. Clean places?

11:17.968 --> 11:19.302
Mm, yum!

11:25.226 --> 11:26.267
It's Danny.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.770
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.315
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

11:33.109 --> 11:36.111
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

11:36.612 --> 11:37.904
The fake kind.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.745
- Um, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
- We have a ladle.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.082
See you at the party.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.291
Okay, great.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.921
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

12:00.302 --> 12:03.763
I'm done. You want anything?
Uh, sports? International?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.223
Apartment listings?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.058
I'll take sports.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.601
Mine!

12:10.312 --> 12:11.896
All right, uh, international.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.148
That's mine too.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.860
I'm Italian.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.824
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.493
Not even on page seven?

12:26.954 --> 12:27.996
Oh, yeah.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.915
You're right.
Oh, here's an affordable place.

12:31.125 --> 12:35.462
Two bedroom, close to work.
Ooh, it's available in five weeks.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.714
What about that circled one?

12:39.049 --> 12:42.343
Ooh, I don't know.
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.262
But it's available now.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.513
Isn't it?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.348
Yes, it is.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.434
Let's go look at it, heh!

12:50.227 --> 12:52.937
- Oh, okay. Let's go.
- There we go! Yay!

12:53.814 --> 13:00.278
Oh, oh, oh, guys, would you, uh, chip in
for some new air filters for the purifier?

13:00.488 --> 13:03.490
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.741
Let's go quicker!

13:04.950 --> 13:06.326
Yeah.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.298
- Oh, my God!
- Mm.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.594
Oh, look at this kitchen/bathroom.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.764
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.475
Somebody was using his head.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.145
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.324
I think this is it.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.911
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.705
But this place is available now.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.959
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.509
So you think I should
take this place?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.387
Oh, it's perfect!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.559
How about you?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.311
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.149
Ah, I see what you guys are saying.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.028
I'll, uh, go downstairs
and fill out an application.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.618
We are bad people.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.956
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.127
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.717
Ready for dinner?

14:45.926 --> 14:47.927
- Ooh, absolutely.
- Great.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.388
You wanted to go to
the Italian place on Bleecker St?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.265
Oh, I love that place, ha, ha.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.601
- So no.
- Oh.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.519
How about Mama Lozetti's?

14:56.729 --> 14:57.896
Yuck.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.856
Sure.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.318
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

15:03.944 --> 15:06.154
No, this place is totally healthy.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.948
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

15:09.158 --> 15:12.285
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.499
Okay, let's go.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.295
Hey, buddy.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.675
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.178
But then I have to go
all the way around.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.097
So you choose convenience
over health?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.850
Stop, Larry.

15:36.018 --> 15:41.606
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

15:41.815 --> 15:43.691
It was exciting at first.

15:43.943 --> 15:48.404
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

15:49.406 --> 15:52.325
I suppose I could give him a warning.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.160
Thank you.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.413
Go, go!

15:59.917 --> 16:03.586
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

16:03.796 --> 16:05.713
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.889
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.724
That was a nice place.

16:16.934 --> 16:22.188
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.360
What do we do?

16:27.861 --> 16:29.404
I don't know.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.322
Maybe pizza?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.450
- About Ross!
- Oh.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.958
Hello.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.543
Oh, yeah.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.422
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.842
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable...

16:51.093 --> 16:55.513
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that, uh, barks into the night.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.892
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

17:00.602 --> 17:02.937
Uh, he's a tap dancer.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.858
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.693
He's a pimp!

17:10.738 --> 17:12.864
There you go. He's a pimp.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.157
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

17:16.743 --> 17:18.536
Hello?

17:29.339 --> 17:30.506
Oh.

17:34.887 --> 17:41.017
Watching for a sound
To lead me to wherever...

17:41.643 --> 17:44.312
Shh, this is never going to work.
He's right there.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.688
Just go say hi.

17:45.856 --> 17:51.486
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.114
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.076
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.285
What's going on?

17:59.536 --> 18:02.830
This is a great party.
Great food, ha, ha.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.794
Oh, you know, most parties, it's, uh,
all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.089
So, um...

18:12.800 --> 18:13.841
What's this?

18:14.718 --> 18:15.760
Salad.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.512
Oh.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.098
And what's this?

18:21.308 --> 18:22.934
Bread.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.852
Aren't you a chef?

18:26.605 --> 18:27.647
Oh.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.024
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.194
Oh, right, tonight was your party.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.530
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

18:35.739 --> 18:39.492
Oh, well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.577
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.996
- Yeah, sure.
- All right?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.708
Whose court is the ball in now?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.919
I thought there wasn't a ball.

18:51.880 --> 18:56.342
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.469
Ball's flying all over the place.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.681
This is my friend, Tom.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.517
This is the girl I told you about.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.937
Oh, come on!
You telling people about me?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.648
I think you two
could really hit it off.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.859
I'm gonna go mingle.

19:14.820 --> 19:19.365
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."

19:25.122 --> 19:26.289
Yeah, okay.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.040
At ease, soldier, heh.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.877
I'm sorry?

19:31.044 --> 19:34.422
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.507
You're Danny's wingman, right?

19:36.675 --> 19:40.928
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.473
I'm going to go talk to, uh, a friend.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.643
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.770
Go tell him, "Nice try."

19:53.734 --> 19:55.902
He just keeps lobbing them up...

19:56.111 --> 19:59.447
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.617
I think I need a drink.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.285
Yeah.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.916
Ninety-eight...

20:10.083 --> 20:11.626
...ninety-nine...

20:11.793 --> 20:13.878
...one hundred!

20:14.046 --> 20:15.296
Okay. Go.

20:15.505 --> 20:18.090
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.346
Here we go, here we go.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.349
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:26.516 --> 20:31.229
So I, uh, didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.605
You're kidding?

20:32.856 --> 20:36.984
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

20:37.236 --> 20:40.696
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.699
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

20:43.909 --> 20:48.412
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.123
Please, just stay.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.667
Yeah.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.960
Are you sure?

20:54.169 --> 20:57.255
- Definitely.
- You have to stay.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.634
- All right.
- All right, buddy.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.762
So I'm a pimp, huh?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.267
It's okay.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.769
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.690
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

21:15.857 --> 21:22.238
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

21:37.587 --> 21:40.798
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.259
The cowboy hat's a little much.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.469
Come on, it's fun!

21:48.515 --> 21:49.557
All right.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.274
Isn't this a woman's hat?

21:59.401 --> 22:02.528
Dude, stop talking crazy,
and make us some tea!
