Did you take drugs, Dru?

02:45.081 --> 02:47.876
-Yeah, I did.
-You shouldn't do that. What did you take?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.920
-Speed.
-Shoot it up or snort it?

02:51.963 --> 02:53.965
[Dru panting]

02:55.758 --> 02:59.679
-Take a deep breath and answer me.
-I can't breathe. I'm fucking scared.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.307
I understand,
but it's your own fault, isn't it?

03:04.601 --> 03:08.188

03:08.271 --> 03:11.149

-Who is this?
-I just have some questions.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.295
-I asked who's calling.
-It's Katherine Harbor.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.297
Are you a journalist?

03:34.380 --> 03:37.091
I thought I said I was.
I'm with the Los Angeles Times.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.219
Is this a bad time? I can call back.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.472
Shouldn't you introduce yourself properly
before you ask questions?

03:42.555 --> 03:45.558
-I wanna get your side of the story.
-How'd you get this number?

03:45.642 --> 03:48.686
-I'm writing about your case--
-How'd you get this number?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.355
As I said, no comment.

03:50.438 --> 03:54.734
-You have my number…
-Baylor. No calls. I already told you.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.487

I've been robbed.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.986
Sir, I need to know where you are.
Last name, Matthew?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.030
-Fontenot. Matthew Fontenot.
-How do you spell that, sir?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.658
F-O-N-T-E-N-O-T.

04:44.158 --> 04:47.245
-Where are you?
-I'm in my car, man. Come quick!

04:47.787 --> 04:49.122
Are you in downtown Los Angeles?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.957
I… I… I think so. I'm here on business.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.628
-I understand, sir. Where are you?
-Bro, doesn't your computer show that?

04:55.712 --> 04:58.923
-No, unfortunately it's not exact.
-I need the fucking police!

04:59.007 --> 05:02.719
I need an address. Get out of your car.
Read a street sign or give me a landmark.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.222
[sighs] I just told you I just got robbed!
I'm not leaving my fucking car!

05:06.306 --> 05:08.683
-What happened, sir?
-What…

05:08.766 --> 05:12.020
A woman pulled a knife
and took my wallet and computer. Okay?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.229
It has all my work.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.106
-And did this just happen?
-Yes.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.275
[woman speaking Spanish over phone]

05:17.358 --> 05:19.277
-On the street?
-[Matthew] Yeah, no.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.488
-In my fucking car, man. I just told you.
-How'd she get in your car?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.823
[Matthew scoffs]

05:23.906 --> 05:25.992
I… Does it matter?

05:26.075 --> 05:28.578
Um… Excuse me? I…

05:28.661 --> 05:30.038
She just jumped in, okay?

05:30.663 --> 05:31.998
-Mm. "Jumped in."
-[woman arguing]

05:32.081 --> 05:34.667

-Uh, do you see the Wells Fargo building?
-I'm on the phone with the police.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.797
-Sir?
-Yes, I'm right below it.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.592
You are on Bunker Hill
in the Financial District.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.637

-I don't know it. It's a rental.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.015
-Is there a door?
-This is fucking crazy.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.975
On the car? Yes, there's a door.

05:51.059 --> 05:55.188
Okay. Open it, get out,
and give me your plate number.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.523
I told you,
I'm not getting out of the car.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.736
Then it should be on the registration.
That should be in your glove compartment.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.280
-Can you tell me how long it's gonna take?
-[objects shuffling]

06:04.364 --> 06:06.866
Aren't you supposed
to fucking protect me, man?

06:06.949 --> 06:09.994
-[Joe] Hmm.
-Jesus Christ. Where on the registration?

06:11.537 --> 06:12.705
Okay, I've got it.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.000
"2DTN35S."

06:17.126 --> 06:20.963
-Make and model of the car, sir?
-It's a blue 7 Series BMW.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.466
What does she look like?

06:23.549 --> 06:28.388
She was young, tall,
dark skin, pink hair, in heels.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.268
Um…

06:34.352 --> 06:37.980

-Mexican. Uh, Hispanic.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.191
Other details you can remember?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.236
She was, uh, voluptuous.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.279
I mean, you know, she was--

06:45.363 --> 06:47.990
Hold the line.
I'm gonna get you a dispatcher.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.451

This is Sergeant Miller.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.834
This is Officer Baylor.
I have a robbery on Bunker Hill.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.919
-Suspect is armed, and--
-Oh, Officer Baylor!

07:00.002 --> 07:03.131
-Are you kidding me? It's Bill.
-Wait, Sarge?

07:03.798 --> 07:05.800
Management rotation thing every week.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.677
-[chuckling] What? Sarge?
-Yeah.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.012
What in the fuck
are you doing at dispatch?

07:10.096 --> 07:14.142
Equal latitude initiative. Every sergeant
mans the phones twice a month.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.394
Oh. That's a good use of resources.

07:16.477 --> 07:21.983
Yeah, political geniuses with ideas
about how to do our fucking job.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.609
This phone duty is shit.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.404
You think so? I… I think it's fantastic.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.449
Tomorrow,
you're going to be back on the street.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.701
[sighs] Can't wait.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.748
We better get on with this.
What do you got?

07:37.832 --> 07:41.377
I got a, um, Matthew Fontenot
robbed by a prostitute on Bunker Hill.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.088
-Some Hispanic broad, pink hair.
-[chuckling] Lovely.

07:44.172 --> 07:48.968
Uh, plate number is California
two-David-Tom-Nora-three-five-Sam.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.180
All right, roger.
We'll get somebody out there.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.390
Uh, you can let him sit
and stew in it for a bit.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.933
[chuckling] Lovely.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.313
Hey, Sarge. I heard about
that pinch at Harbor Division last week.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.857
Yeah, it was wild. Like 13 kilos.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.859
-AK's stash?
-Yeah, we got him.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.153
-You bring Major Narcotics?
-Yeah, of course.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.989
Yeah, it was, uh, Chayney and Hunt.
They brought SWAT.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.032
Nice.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.993
Everything okay with Rick?

08:14.619 --> 08:15.453
Yeah.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.539
Why wouldn't it be?

08:20.541 --> 08:21.792
-No reason.
-Mm-hmm.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.130
-Yeah. He's good.
-Right.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.718
I'll get the unit en route.
Talk to you later.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.261
-Later, Sarge.
-Bye.

-I'm back, sir.
-[Matthew] Jesus, finally!

08:43.606 --> 08:45.191
Hey, I've got a wife, man.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.902
She's an angry woman.
She's very strong physically.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.946
She doesn't know. I'm just on business.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
-Officers are on their way, sir.
-And…

08:52.114 --> 08:54.116
[newscaster speaking indistinctly]

08:56.702 --> 08:58.871
[man 1] Try and settle down
until the officer arrives.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.208
No. A steak knife duct-taped
to a broom handle is not…

09:02.833 --> 09:04.752
Yes. In five minutes. Yes.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.964
[woman 1] Sir, you still there?

Okay, good. Is there a cross street?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.310
Cross street.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.606
Okay. Did you get a look at the car, sir?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.401
What color was the vehicle?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.821
Sir, did you see the direction
the car was moving?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.407
Okay, down Slauson. Okay, sir.

Please hold. Please… Please hold.

You know what to do. Leave a message.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.385
[line beeps]

10:36.969 --> 10:40.598
I know that I'm not supposed to, um…

10:42.308 --> 10:45.102
But if Paige is awake,
uh, could I say good night?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.896
It would mean a lot.

Okay.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.752
Emily, try and keep calm.
We need to figure out where you are.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.087
Right, I show that
you're outside city limits.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.384
Try and stay calm. Keep pretending

15:50.866 --> 15:52.534

She doesn't want to talk to you.
I'm sorry.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.381
I need the color of the car.
When I say the right one, say it's fine.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.454
-[officer] Any weapons?
-[man] No, man.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.372
[sighs]

18:46.166 --> 18:49.545
-[Rodriguez] What are you carrying?
-[man] Officer, what's the matter?

18:50.629 --> 18:53.674
[Rodriguez] Watch him.
Watch him, I got it.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.765
Wrong van, LAPD. No woman.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.058
What? [struggles]

19:03.142 --> 19:04.226
Are you sure?

19:05.519 --> 19:06.395
[Rodriguez] Yes.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.856
-Is it white?
-[Rodriguez clears throat]

-A white van.
-That's not enough.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.627
-I have six patrol cars up here.
-I know, I know. License plate.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.839
All I have is a driver's license
and address, but I keep looking.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.633
Look for a plate number,
then I'll inform the officers.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.846
All right, I'll keep looking.
What about closing the freeway?

19:41.346 --> 19:42.181
Hold.

-Yes.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.551
We're protectors.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.430
No.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.935
We protect people that need help.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.729
You hurt people. You took my daddy away.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.777
[Abby continues crying]

24:05.861 --> 24:07.237
Where's my mommy?

24:08.655 --> 24:10.282
I'm gonna find your mommy.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.617
I'm gonna bring her back
to you and your little brother.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.580
You want me to do that?

24:18.373 --> 24:21.042
-I want Mommy.
-I know.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.961
[Abby continues crying]

24:24.129 --> 24:26.047
I get scared of being alone too.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.719
You know what I do when I'm lonely?
I turn on the TV, and I have company.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.262
Why don't you go do that?

24:35.348 --> 24:36.475
It's broken.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.145
Why don't you go sit
with your little brother?

24:43.648 --> 24:46.568
-He's sleeping.
-It's okay. Just go in there.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.696
Dad said don't wake him up.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.282
You won't wake him up
if you're very, very quiet.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.617
In the meantime,

24:53.700 --> 24:57.412
I'm gonna send some officers over there
to look after you and Oliver, okay?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.957
I don't wanna talk anymore. I want Mommy.

25:01.041 --> 25:05.879
Someone's going to be with you soon.
If you need help, then call 911.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.881
Can you say that for me?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.552
911.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.514
You press those numbers,
just like you call your daddy.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.973
-911.
-That's right.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.184
And my name is Joe. Can you say that?

25:21.978 --> 25:23.980
911. Joe.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.942
Good. Good girl, Abby.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.401
Okay, bye-bye.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.912

25:44.459 --> 25:45.293

25:49.548 --> 25:51.633
Has anyone gotten a call
from Emily Lighton?

25:51.716 --> 25:53.552
What's going on, Baylor? What do you need?

25:53.635 --> 25:56.137
Just… have you gotten
a call from an Emily Lighton?

25:57.847 --> 25:59.516
-Well, how about you, Manny?
-No.

Two-Frank-Tom-David-twelve-King.
I'll pass it on.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.623
She's with her ex.
Henry Fisher. He took her.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.335
-10-4.
-The suspect has a knife.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.672
-I'll pass it on.
-And a history of assault.

26:31.464 --> 26:32.757
I'll relay the plate number.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.010
Is there a unit you can send to her house?

26:36.052 --> 26:39.431
-I have to relay the plate now.
-Right, but what's your plan?

26:40.140 --> 26:43.518
-To wait until they find the van?
-Yeah, but you need a plan.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.853
-Joe.
-There's a little girl--

26:44.936 --> 26:48.440
The quicker they get the plate number,
the faster we'll find them, right?

26:48.523 --> 26:49.899
No, no, no. Listen.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.485
-You have to make sure--
-Thanks for the plate number.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.280
Listen, I was thinking
that if you could send a car--

26:55.363 --> 26:56.698
No, you listen.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.118
[frustratedly] Listen!
I am up to my ass in calls.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.496
Wait for her to call back.
Do your job, and I'll do mine. Okay?

27:07.125 --> 27:07.959
Okay?

27:11.129 --> 27:11.963
Yeah.

to tell your side. It runs tomorrow.

-Who is this?
-I just have a few questions.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.223
Who is this?

28:03.306 --> 28:05.100

Hey, is it cold in here?

28:26.746 --> 28:28.248
Feels all right to me.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.128
-Manny?
-Yeah?

28:35.463 --> 28:36.715
I've been an asshole.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.511
-Not just today, but in general.
-Yes, you have.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.266
We should get a beer sometime.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.687

[Joe chuckling]

28:56.151 --> 28:58.987
Hey, I got a technical question.

28:59.070 --> 28:59.904
Sure.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.158
Uh, if I log out of my computer
and I log into another one,

29:03.241 --> 29:04.951
will I still get the same calls?

29:05.034 --> 29:07.078
Yes, they follow your login,
not your computer.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.164
So your system can go anywhere you go.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.669
Where you going? We're off in 15.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.254

Hey, Sarge. It's Joe.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.753
[chuckling] Hey. Christ!
Do you ever go home?

29:56.836 --> 29:58.129
Am I interrupting something?

29:58.213 --> 30:01.800
No, God, no.
This is more boring than taking a shit.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.218
Not if you're constipated.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.553
[laughs] Well, yeah, that's true.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.055
You got a sec?

30:08.348 --> 30:10.683
Sure, man, it's calm down here. What's up?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.144
I need you to do me a favor.

30:14.562 --> 30:15.730
Sure thing. What do you need?

30:15.814 --> 30:19.234
Could you send a car over
to 5800 Regis Street, Apartment 6?

30:19.317 --> 30:22.028
-It's urgent.
-All right. Yeah, you got it. Why?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.697
I'm working a convicted felon,
kidnapped his ex-wife,

30:24.781 --> 30:26.616
left two kids at the mother's house.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.535
I need someone to send a unit over there.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.330
Okay, uh, how do you know
the kids are in there?

30:32.413 --> 30:33.873
I spoke to a girl, Abby.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.960
All right, and are the parents home?

30:37.544 --> 30:40.255
No. He took her and they're mobile
somewhere east of the city.

30:40.338 --> 30:44.634
-And did you talk to CHP?
-Yes. But CHP is looking for the vehicle.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.719
Sarge, look… [sighs]

30:46.803 --> 30:47.929
…they don't live together

30:48.012 --> 30:50.181
and both of their residences
are in our jurisdiction,

30:50.265 --> 30:53.935
so I need you to send
a unit over to the mother's house.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.062
[clears throat] And I need you
to send another unit…

30:56.145 --> 30:57.814
[coughs] over to his house.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.150
Well, is there anyone at his house?

31:01.234 --> 31:04.737
I think he lives alone, but there might be
clues to where they're going over at his.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.908
-Mm-hmm. I don't know, Joe.
-We need to hurry.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.286
Get a unit to the mother's house
and one to his.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.288
Kick his fucking door in if you have to.

31:14.372 --> 31:18.001
-Hmm. What… What was that?
-Kick his fucking door in.

31:20.795 --> 31:21.838
Joe, excuse me?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.882
I talked to a terrified six-year-old girl,

31:23.965 --> 31:26.384
and I promised her
that her mother would come home.

31:26.467 --> 31:29.804
I'm assuming that
there's no warrant for his residence.

31:29.888 --> 31:34.100
So I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check on the kid.

31:34.183 --> 31:37.562
No. I need you
to send a unit over to his house,

31:37.645 --> 31:40.148
and I need you
to send a unit over to her house.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.610
-Joe, it's too much--
-No, God damn it, Bill!

31:43.693 --> 31:47.113
There is a scared little girl
whose mother has been abducted.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.574
That's enough! It's enough!
What are you trying to do?

31:50.533 --> 31:52.660
You are in enough trouble already.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.996
I will send a car to the mother's house,

31:55.079 --> 31:58.041
but I'm not gonna have
anyone kicking in any fucking doors.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.919
It's not your job.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.548
-I know that.
-Yeah, well, apparently you don't.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.303
Does this have
anything to do with tomorrow?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.598
-What? No. I'm just trying to…
-[high-pitched ringing]

32:13.681 --> 32:17.143
-You want to talk to a new psychologist?
-[coughing] I'm just trying to help.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.853
-Do you need to do that?
-No.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.814
I mean, I know
you didn't get along with the last one.

32:21.898 --> 32:22.815
No. I'm fine.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.275
-What's that?
-No, I'm fine.

32:24.984 --> 32:28.488
Okay. All right.
So then, when are you off?

32:29.197 --> 32:31.240
I don't know. Uh, ten minutes.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.662
Okay, good.
You're gonna go to court tomorrow.

32:36.371 --> 32:40.667
Afterwards, you'll be back on the street,
and you'll be off the phone.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.464

-Yeah.

-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

Uh, yeah, Vikki said that there were…

37:05.765 --> 37:09.518
federal officers over there the other day,
offering him something…

37:10.645 --> 37:13.731
Maybe. I mean, I don't know. Joe, please.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.736
Were they over at our house?

37:19.528 --> 37:22.406
Stop. I'm not… I'm not doing this, Joe.

Why did you just call me? Tell me that.

37:30.706 --> 37:35.378

37:36.712 --> 37:37.713
Okay?

37:39.257 --> 37:40.466
Are you coming tomorrow?

37:43.678 --> 37:46.013
I don't really think
that's such a good idea.

37:46.097 --> 37:50.268
'Cause you know it would look really good
to have the wife there, you know?

37:51.185 --> 37:53.396
Right. Yeah. Okay.

37:54.063 --> 37:57.316
-I'm gonna go, Joe.

My wife and I are separated.
We're separated.

supposed to talk in here either?

-They shouldn't be alone.
-All right, now just listen.

53:49.726 --> 53:52.938

54:17.212 --> 54:19.714
-I'm gonna die.
-Emily, take a deep breath.

54:20.298 --> 54:24.052
Now, I'm gonna get you back to Abby,
but I need your help. All right?

54:24.135 --> 54:28.348
I need you to find something in the van
to defend yourself with.

54:28.848 --> 54:31.434
-Is there anything back there?
-I can't see anything.

54:31.518 --> 54:34.562

Use the flashlight on your phone.

[Emily panting]

54:37.065 --> 54:40.735
There's a cardboard box. A heavy box.

-Bricks.
-Okay. Okay, good.

When he stops the van
and he opens those doors,

54:59.963 --> 55:03.883
I want you to hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.344

Then you take his knife
and then you tell me where you are,

55:15.061 --> 55:16.354
and I will send help.

55:16.438 --> 55:17.355
I can't.

I don't know if that's a… a food.

56:31.096 --> 56:32.806
Keep breathing with me, all right?

56:32.889 --> 56:35.642
-I like--
-What do you like to do in your free time?

56:38.520 --> 56:43.650
I like to be with Abby
and with Oliver, but Henry… [cries]

56:43.733 --> 56:44.776
Henry…

56:44.859 --> 56:48.571
What do you do with your kids, Emily?

Come on.

56:53.076 --> 56:55.078
[Emily sighs deeply]

56:57.122 --> 56:58.581
We like the aquarium.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.292
Where?

57:01.376 --> 57:03.378
[both breathe deeply]

57:05.171 --> 57:06.297
San Pedro.

57:07.799 --> 57:08.967
Have you been there?

57:10.093 --> 57:14.431
No, I've always meant to,
uh, take my daughter there,

57:14.514 --> 57:16.933
but we never had a chance to.

57:18.268 --> 57:21.771
Tell me about…
Tell me about the aquarium. Is it nice?

57:23.481 --> 57:28.486
Abby… Abby likes the turtles.

57:29.237 --> 57:32.198
She doesn't even look
at the sharks. [chuckles]

57:33.283 --> 57:35.660
What do…
What do you like? You like the sharks?

57:38.037 --> 57:40.874
[sighs] I like all of them.

57:42.625 --> 57:47.297
I usually walk behind Abby
with Oliver in the baby carriage,

57:49.466 --> 57:51.384
and then I just look

57:52.594 --> 57:53.845
and feel.

57:56.306 --> 57:57.182
Feel what?

57:57.265 --> 57:59.684
[Emily breathes deeply]

58:00.643 --> 58:02.812
Seems so peaceful.

58:06.816 --> 58:07.650
What does?

58:10.987 --> 58:12.989
Under the water. Like…

58:15.074 --> 58:16.534
Like quiet.

58:17.368 --> 58:19.037
Like being held.

58:21.372 --> 58:26.961
No distractions.
Just water flowing around you.

58:28.129 --> 58:29.839
Very quiet,

58:30.715 --> 58:31.966
like a big,

58:33.218 --> 58:35.637
blue silence.

58:38.473 --> 58:39.307
Yeah.

58:42.393 --> 58:44.020
[Emily sighs]

58:45.772 --> 58:47.190
I forgot your name.

58:49.442 --> 58:51.611
My name is Joe.

58:55.698 --> 58:56.991
I like you, Joe.

59:00.119 --> 59:01.371
I like you too, Emily.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.752
Would you like to come with us?

59:08.503 --> 59:09.587
I'd love to.

59:15.468 --> 59:16.928

59:28.273 --> 59:30.692
-Put your phone in your pocket.
-I'm scared.

59:30.775 --> 59:32.318
And when he opens those doors,

59:32.402 --> 59:35.446
you take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

59:35.530 --> 59:37.282
-He deserves it.
-Oh God.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.868
-He deserves it.
-That's right.

59:42.870 --> 59:44.330
Now put your phone away.

59:45.123 --> 59:48.459
-Put in your pocket.
-He was so angry.

59:48.543 --> 59:50.503
-I know.
-He was so angry.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.464
I know. I know. Emily, put the phone away.

-Oliver's fine. Oliver's fine.
-Just put the phone away when he opens--

59:58.011 --> 1:00:00.555
Oliver's fine. He isn't even crying now.

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:02.390
What was that?

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:05.435
[Emily continues crying]

1:00:06.853 --> 1:00:08.021
The snakes.

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:10.189
Snakes? What snakes?

1:00:12.066 --> 1:00:14.694
He was in so much pain.

1:00:14.777 --> 1:00:18.323
They were… in his stomach.

1:00:18.406 --> 1:00:21.659
He kept crying
because he had snakes in his stomach.

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:25.830
And I just took them out.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:28.374
[suspenseful music playing]

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:32.795
I just took them out.

1:00:38.134 --> 1:00:40.011
Was it… you?

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:47.727
He's… He's not crying anymore.
He's much, so much better.

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:54.025
He's fine, isn't he? Joe? [crying]

1:00:54.108 --> 1:00:57.528
Joe? Please tell me he's fine.

1:01:02.241 --> 1:01:03.826
[Emily] He's gonna lock me up.

1:01:04.577 --> 1:01:07.455
-Get away from me! Stop it!
-[objects knocking over phone]

1:01:07.538 --> 1:01:10.333
[Henry] Hey, hey, hey!

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.210
-[Emily] Stop it!
-[Henry yells]

1:01:12.293 --> 1:01:13.670
-[heavy thud]
-[line disconnects]

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:24.597
[cell phone buzzing]

1:01:30.895 --> 1:01:31.813
[Rick] Hello?

1:01:32.897 --> 1:01:34.232
Hello? Are you there, Joe?

1:01:35.733 --> 1:01:38.069
I think there's something wrong
with my phone. Hang on.

1:01:38.569 --> 1:01:40.363
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1:01:43.491 --> 1:01:44.826
I think I found something.

1:01:45.535 --> 1:01:47.161
They went to court over custody.

1:01:47.704 --> 1:01:50.915
Henry has letters from a lawyer.
Looks like he lost visitation rights.

1:01:50.998 --> 1:01:54.001
It's about his criminal record
and his sentences for assault.

1:01:54.085 --> 1:01:55.086
No fucking wonder.

1:01:57.630 --> 1:02:00.466
-Joe?
-[sighs]

1:02:02.051 --> 1:02:02.969
Joe?

1:02:04.262 --> 1:02:06.347
Yeah? Yeah?

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:09.809
Sorry, I'll get to the point.

1:02:10.476 --> 1:02:14.313
The only thing from San Bernardino are
unpaid bills from Patton State Hospital.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:15.982
Uh, she was a patient there.

1:02:21.154 --> 1:02:22.780
-[breathes shakily]
-Joe?

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:27.326
Patton State Psychiatric Treatment Center.
Does that help any?

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:30.246
She doesn't want to be locked up.

1:02:32.123 --> 1:02:32.957
What was that?

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:35.710
She doesn't want to be locked up.

1:02:36.711 --> 1:02:39.630
-[quietly] God. Shit.
-You lost me there, brother.

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:42.425
Joe?

1:02:42.508 --> 1:02:43.634
[cell phone beeps]

1:03:03.362 --> 1:03:05.031
[typing]

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:08.868
[line ringing]

1:03:09.911 --> 1:03:11.621
-Henry?
-[Henry softly] Hello?

1:03:12.663 --> 1:03:15.583
Joe from LAPD.
Are you at… Are you at Patton?

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:17.460
-The State Hospital?
-Oh. Yeah.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:19.337
Yeah. Yeah.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:22.548
[Henry groans softly]

1:03:23.132 --> 1:03:25.426
-Okay, uh, where is Emily?
-God.

1:03:28.262 --> 1:03:30.431
Uh, I don't know. I think she hit me.

1:03:31.057 --> 1:03:32.183
Okay, I'll send help.

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:35.228
-Do you need an ambulance?
-No, no, no.

1:03:35.311 --> 1:03:37.271
-No police.
-Henry, I have to.

1:03:37.355 --> 1:03:39.857
-I have to.
-God, I haven't done anything, man.

1:03:39.941 --> 1:03:40.858
No.

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:42.777
I know. I know.

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:45.112
[Henry crying]

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:47.365
Why didn't you tell me?

1:03:47.448 --> 1:03:51.494
You should have just called the police
and let us take care of Emily.

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:54.789
-Why?
-I wanna help her.

1:03:54.872 --> 1:03:55.706
Huh?

1:03:56.249 --> 1:03:59.001
-You wanna help her? Fuck.
-Yes, that is my job.

1:04:00.169 --> 1:04:02.213
Let me tell you something. Nobody helps.

1:04:02.296 --> 1:04:04.549
We get doctors, lawyers, social workers.

1:04:04.632 --> 1:04:07.510
Nobody helps, just fucking nobody.

1:04:07.593 --> 1:04:10.346
You trying to tell me
a cop's gonna help me? [sobs]

1:04:10.429 --> 1:04:11.681
I'm trying to help.

1:04:13.140 --> 1:04:17.395
-Oh yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you!
-[object thuds over phone]

1:04:18.396 --> 1:04:19.605
She killed my son.

1:04:20.606 --> 1:04:22.817
Killed my son. My son.

1:04:23.568 --> 1:04:25.903
My son is dead. [continues sobbing]

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:35.204
[Henry continues sobbing]

1:04:44.630 --> 1:04:47.008
[sobbing] Last November…

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:49.051
we, uh…

1:04:50.511 --> 1:04:52.263
Discount ran out, man.

1:04:54.098 --> 1:04:57.310
We said we'd try,
that we'd try to do it without her meds.

1:04:57.393 --> 1:04:58.936
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1:05:00.813 --> 1:05:05.526
I couldn't pay for them,
you know, like, because I…

1:05:05.610 --> 1:05:06.777
Oh my God.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:09.780
-[Henry sighs]
-[clattering over phone]

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:12.533
Henry? What are you doing?

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:14.243
[Henry crying]

1:05:15.077 --> 1:05:18.456
Oh my God, Abby.
I should never have left her.

1:05:18.539 --> 1:05:21.417
No, no. Henry,
the police are with her. Hen… Hen…

1:05:22.043 --> 1:05:27.506
Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
need you to try and calm down.

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.133
[Henry sobbing]

1:05:29.216 --> 1:05:31.844
She's just a little baby…
just a little baby girl.

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:35.890
I told her not to go in there.
Oh my God. I need to get Abby.

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:39.143
-[engine starts over phone]
-No, Henry. Henry, listen to me.

1:05:39.226 --> 1:05:43.022
Henry, the police have her.
The police. She is safe. She is safe.

1:05:43.105 --> 1:05:45.483
She is fine. She is fine.

1:05:45.566 --> 1:05:49.528
-Where is Emily? We have to find Emily.
-[Henry crying] I don't know.

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:51.781
-Henry?
-I don't know where she is.

1:05:52.823 --> 1:05:55.451
Henry, do you think
that she could harm herself?

1:05:55.952 --> 1:05:59.038
I don't know.
I don't know. Listen. Just listen.

1:05:59.997 --> 1:06:02.083
Listen to me. Okay? Listen.

1:06:02.750 --> 1:06:06.504
She has no idea what she's done.

1:06:06.587 --> 1:06:10.257
[sniffles] She… she thinks… Oh my God.

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:13.177
She thinks that she helped Oliver.

1:06:14.178 --> 1:06:16.681
I didn't have
the heart to tell her that she…

1:06:16.764 --> 1:06:19.600
Oh God, she wasn't always like this.

1:06:20.559 --> 1:06:22.186
She's just sick.

1:06:23.646 --> 1:06:27.566
And I just…
I needed to help her. She's just…

1:06:27.650 --> 1:06:29.402
-[Henry crying]
-[line disconnects]

[typing]

1:06:36.867 --> 1:06:38.869
[line ringing]

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:47.378
This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…

1:06:47.461 --> 1:06:48.713

1:07:10.401 --> 1:07:11.986
[breath trembling]

1:07:12.069 --> 1:07:14.196
We have a caller who wants to talk to you.

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:15.364
What?

1:07:15.448 --> 1:07:18.325
A caller wants to talk to you.
She says you talked before.

1:07:18.409 --> 1:07:20.703
-Her name is Emily--
-No. What? Where is she?

1:07:20.786 --> 1:07:23.039
Yes, now! Now, man!

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:43.893
Where are you?

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:47.229
I'm gonna go find Oliver and Abby.

1:07:48.105 --> 1:07:50.316
I'm gonna take them to the aquarium.

1:07:50.816 --> 1:07:54.195
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1:07:54.278 --> 1:07:55.905
We'll show you the turtles.

1:07:56.405 --> 1:07:57.281
[sighs]

1:07:58.032 --> 1:07:59.492
Oliver loves the turtles.

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:00.785
No, you're not…

1:08:02.244 --> 1:08:03.704
You're not gonna find Oliver.

1:08:05.289 --> 1:08:06.499
Oliver's not there.

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:08.626
Emily. Emily, I need you…

1:08:09.668 --> 1:08:12.421
-He's better now.
-Emily, I need you to look around you.

1:08:12.505 --> 1:08:15.424
Okay? Where are you?
Where are you? I hear cars.

1:08:15.508 --> 1:08:18.094
Uh… Uh… Can you see what's around you?

1:08:20.930 --> 1:08:21.764
I…

It's not yours. Okay. Just look up.

Okay? Look up and tell me where you are.
What can you see? I hear cars.

1:08:57.675 --> 1:08:58.843
Is that… Is that right?

Are there cars nearby?

1:09:29.748 --> 1:09:31.167
[Emily crying]

1:09:32.126 --> 1:09:33.627
No, Henry's okay.

1:09:35.963 --> 1:09:40.342
If this isn't my blood then,
Joe, whose blood is this?

1:09:40.426 --> 1:09:41.927
No, Emily…

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:45.764
-Whose blood is this? Whose blood is this?
-Emily. Emily.

We were all just trying to help you.
We're all just trying to help you. Just…

1:10:36.106 --> 1:10:38.484
You said that he deserved it, Joe.

1:10:45.115 --> 1:10:46.408
I was wrong.

1:10:48.452 --> 1:10:49.745
It's my… It's my fault.

1:10:50.496 --> 1:10:53.666
It's my fault, Emily.
It's my fault that you're on the overpass.

Okay? Just please,
please don't do anything stupid.

Okay? Abby is waiting
for you to come home.

Joe, I'm gonna go be with Oliver.

I don't know.
I don't know because I… I could.

I just wanted to punish him.

1:12:02.609 --> 1:12:05.279
I wanted to punish him
because I was angry.

1:12:05.362 --> 1:12:10.701
I'm just so, I'm so angry,
and I… I… I just…

1:12:10.784 --> 1:12:13.537
He… he… he did something
and he hurt someone.
