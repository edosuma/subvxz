00:02.118 --> 00:03.812
<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.987 --> 00:05.955
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike?

00:06.122 --> 00:08.613
You're a doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.

00:08.792 --> 00:10.657
- The sun and moon curse?
- Klaus is the real deal.

00:10.827 --> 00:15.423
- From the first generation of vampires.
- The oldest vampire is coming after me?

00:15.598 --> 00:17.463
- Elijah?
- One of the Originals. A legend.

00:17.634 --> 00:19.192
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

00:19.369 --> 00:23.100
You and I draw Klaus out, and I shall make
certain your friends remain unharmed.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.740
- Then what?
- Then I kill him.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.933
- Take me away.
- Where would you like to go?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.408
These must be
the Jonathan Gilbert journals.

00:29.579 --> 00:32.980
I come bearing gifts.
This is how you kill an Original.

00:33.149 --> 00:35.845
That ring Isobel gave you?
That's mine. I want that back.

00:36.019 --> 00:38.010
Did he tell you what happened
to his wife?

00:38.221 --> 00:39.779
- What are you saying?
- Ask Ric.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.424
- How will you kill Klaus?
- After the sacrifice.

00:42.592 --> 00:43.684
After the sacrifice?

00:43.860 --> 00:46.852
- Elena has to die.
- You knew you weren't gonna survive?

00:47.030 --> 00:51.296
If it comes down to people I love getting
killed or me, I know what my choice is.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.995
You're being a martyr.
That's not heroic. That's tragic.

01:01.044 --> 01:03.774
<i>With the dying embers</i>
<i>of the fire at Fell's Church...</i>

01:03.947 --> 01:06.973
<i>...the scourge of the vampires</i>
<i>had passed.</i>

01:07.150 --> 01:09.846
<i>And though war raged all around us...</i>

01:10.019 --> 01:12.613
<i>...our town was safe</i>
<i>from the demons of the night.</i>

01:15.792 --> 01:18.124
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

01:19.129 --> 01:22.997
<i>The monsters we drove to their</i>
<i>fiery deaths had begat new monsters.</i>

01:25.001 --> 01:26.628
Did you hear that?

01:35.912 --> 01:37.072
- Stay here.
- No, Thomas.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.180
It's all right. The vampires are dead.

01:39.349 --> 01:43.649
Yes, Honoria, they burned in the church.
We're safe now.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.920
Please, Jonathan. I'm worried.

01:55.098 --> 01:56.656
Very well. I shall go too.

02:03.339 --> 02:05.603
I can prove there are no vampires.

02:10.013 --> 02:11.310
See?

02:24.227 --> 02:26.024
Thomas?

02:26.529 --> 02:27.621
Thomas!

02:35.205 --> 02:37.799
- Thomas!
- No, stay inside. Get back in the house.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.710
<i>I knew I was about to die.</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:47.148
<i>You cannot run from a vampire.</i>

02:49.552 --> 02:53.886
<i>I saw the vampire who killed me.</i>
<i>I recognized him.</i>

02:54.057 --> 02:55.456
<i>It was Stefan Salvatore.</i>

03:25.255 --> 03:26.722
- What's going on?
- <i>I showered...</i>

03:26.890 --> 03:27.914
<i>...I shaved...</i>

03:28.958 --> 03:31.290
...had breakfast. I'm very relaxed.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.985
Makes one of us.

03:33.162 --> 03:35.255
<i>I did hear one piece</i>
<i>of good news, though.</i>

03:35.431 --> 03:38.594
Tyler Lockwood ran away from home
last night.

03:38.768 --> 03:39.894
- Hey.
- <i>How do you know?</i>

03:41.271 --> 03:45.765
Well, I heard it from Sheriff Forbes
who heard it from Carol Lockwood.

03:45.942 --> 03:47.603
Thus ending our werewolf chapter...

03:47.777 --> 03:50.405
...bringing us to...
- Killing Elijah.

03:51.347 --> 03:54.111
- Exactly.
- It's not gonna be easy. He's crafty.

03:54.284 --> 03:56.445
- I've got a crafty dagger.
- He's an Original.

03:56.619 --> 03:58.450
We don't know
what that encompasses.

03:58.621 --> 04:01.454
Trust me. I'm gonna dot my T's.
I don't want any surprises.

04:01.624 --> 04:04.388
Wow, Damon. You're actually
gonna be careful for once?

04:04.560 --> 04:08.360
Yes, Stefan, I've become you.
How tragic for both of us.

04:08.531 --> 04:11.694
Gotta run.
Have a murder to plan. Busy day.

04:21.978 --> 04:25.573
The old Fell property actually starts
just beyond that fence.

04:25.748 --> 04:28.911
Ah, the Fells.
One of the founding families.

04:29.085 --> 04:31.212
Why do you say it like that?

04:31.454 --> 04:34.480
My research showed me that this area
was actually settled...

04:34.657 --> 04:36.716
...almost two full centuries earlier.

04:36.893 --> 04:38.986
There was a migration of townsfolk
from the Northeast.

04:39.162 --> 04:41.926
Um, it was Salem, to be precise.

04:42.098 --> 04:45.090
Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?

04:45.268 --> 04:48.669
Which means the ever-lauded
founding families...

04:48.838 --> 04:51.272
...didn't actually found anything.

04:51.474 --> 04:53.772
Well, I bet it was the men
who made a big deal...

04:53.977 --> 04:56.207
...about being founders back in 1860.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.574
Men are very territorial.

04:58.748 --> 05:01.114
Yes, they are.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.410
Uh...

05:04.587 --> 05:07.750
Elijah, this is my friend
Alaric Saltzman.

05:07.924 --> 05:11.121
I got your, uh, message about
walking Elijah through the property lines.

05:11.294 --> 05:16.197
I thought I would, uh, tag along.
You know, being a history buff and all.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.860
Where to next?

05:19.635 --> 05:22.934
I'm pretty curious
about the freed slave property owners.

05:23.439 --> 05:27.739
Some say the descendents of the slaves
are the true keepers of American history.

05:27.910 --> 05:31.869
I only brought the surveys. I've got
that list in my car. Just give me a sec.

05:36.386 --> 05:38.718
Alaric Saltzman.

05:42.025 --> 05:45.290
You're one of those people
on Elena's list of loved ones to protect.

05:45.461 --> 05:46.758
Yeah, so is Jenna.

05:46.929 --> 05:52.026
You don't have to be jealous.
I rarely pursue younger women.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.540
- It's a joke, Ric. Lighten up.
- You're funny.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.483
Hey. What are you doing?

06:09.652 --> 06:10.914
Thinking about last night.

06:11.087 --> 06:12.782
Yeah, yeah, uh, me too.

06:12.955 --> 06:16.118
You know, it was a tough spell.
I could feel it draining me.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.784
- I need practice.
- Yeah, well, uh, maybe... I don't know.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.363
Maybe you should come over tonight.
We could practice, get stronger.

06:23.566 --> 06:25.295
Yeah. Sure.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.459
Thanks.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.334
Ah, incoming.

06:36.946 --> 06:39.107
Wanna tell me
what happened yesterday?

06:39.282 --> 06:42.115
- Sorry?
- Don't play dumb. You both were here...

06:42.285 --> 06:44.617
- And?
- And that's all I remember.

06:44.787 --> 06:48.279
One minute I'm playing pool, the next,
I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.949
Sorry, Luka, but everything
seemed normal yesterday.

06:51.127 --> 06:53.891
I mean, I brought you a coffee
and we played pool.

06:54.097 --> 06:58.591
- See, I think you're lying.
- And I think you need to back off.

07:26.562 --> 07:27.859
Are you still mad?

07:29.365 --> 07:31.993
- Yeah, I'm still mad.
- We have a difference of opinion.

07:32.168 --> 07:33.897
We're not gonna agree on everything.

07:34.070 --> 07:36.061
You agreed to sacrifice yourself
to Klaus.

07:36.239 --> 07:40.573
To say we have a difference of opinion
is the understatement of the century.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.504
You would know.

07:48.918 --> 07:51.148
What does Jonathan Gilbert
have to say?

07:54.524 --> 07:57.357
A lot. It's insane...

07:57.527 --> 07:59.392
...the things he wrote in his journal.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.054
What he kept from the founding families.
Stuff that nobody knows.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.723
Stuff that you've never told me.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.904
We were, um...

08:19.448 --> 08:23.612
We were angry at the founding families
for what they did to Katherine.

08:23.786 --> 08:25.447
We wanted revenge.

08:25.988 --> 08:29.685
I didn't know about Jonathan Gilbert's
ring yet. I didn't know he would...

08:32.227 --> 08:33.751
That he would survive.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.760
He described you as a monster.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.232
That's what I was.

08:40.970 --> 08:43.336
I want you to know the truth.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.438
But I want you to hear it from me.

08:49.779 --> 08:54.182
<i>In the weeks after I became a vampire,</i>
<i>I relished in it.</i>

08:54.350 --> 08:56.318
<i>I took it to the darkest place I could.</i>

09:02.358 --> 09:03.916
Ugh, who wants to die next?

09:04.093 --> 09:06.493
- Me. I'm next.
- Me. He promised me.

09:09.165 --> 09:12.157
What about you? You know,
if you don't pick up the tempo...

09:12.335 --> 09:15.793
...you're gonna lose your head.
Snap, snap.

09:23.512 --> 09:27.539
- Company, brother?
- I brought enough to share.

09:27.717 --> 09:30.481
Are you mad, bringing them here
when the town is hunting us?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.213
If you're worried
about the founding families, don't be.

09:33.389 --> 09:35.983
They're all dead or about to be.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.191
Yeah.

09:39.362 --> 09:43.298
Leave this place. Never think of it again.
Same for you.

09:43.466 --> 09:45.491
Leave this place.
Never think of it again.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.465
Don't be like this. I'm having fun.

09:47.637 --> 09:49.662
Staying alive is more fun, Stefan.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.966
We have to be more careful.
More clever.

09:52.141 --> 09:54.575
- Like Katherine was.
- Huh. Look where that got her.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.973
I'm done here.

10:00.283 --> 10:04.014
With you. I'm leaving town.

10:06.922 --> 10:08.719
You hate me, I know. I know.

10:08.891 --> 10:11.860
An eternity of misery and on and on.
You don't have to leave.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.862
- Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
- No. You will get us killed.

10:17.099 --> 10:19.863
I'd rather leave you
to do that to yourself.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.528
<i>I wasn't myself then.</i>
<i>I was full of guilt.</i>

10:23.706 --> 10:26.402
<i>What I did to my father,</i>
<i>to my brother.</i>

10:26.575 --> 10:28.873
<i>I had to turn it off.</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:31.343
<i>It was the only way I could survive.</i>

10:31.514 --> 10:33.106
It sounds like you were Damon.

10:36.352 --> 10:37.819
I was worse.

10:40.222 --> 10:43.680
Other than your lecture on Mystic Falls,
get anything out of Elijah?

10:43.859 --> 10:46.919
No, it was boring. Ugh.

10:47.596 --> 10:49.757
Of course, Jenna thinks he's charming.

10:50.766 --> 10:53.963
- You sound jealous. He sound jealous?
- Kind of do.

10:54.136 --> 10:56.536
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.805
Andie? She's been compelled
not to divulge my secrets, haven't you?

11:01.977 --> 11:03.706
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.107
My lips are sealed.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.238
This is too weird.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.412
I just need the right opportunity.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.214
Ah.

11:15.391 --> 11:17.757
There's Jenna with her new boyfriend.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.824
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

11:20.996 --> 11:22.429
- Hi.
- I hear you two had, uh...

11:22.598 --> 11:26.432
...quite a meeting of historical minds.
- Yeah. I guess you could say that.

11:26.602 --> 11:31.164
Well, as much as I'd like to continue
this, I, uh, I've got papers to grade.

11:32.508 --> 11:34.499
You know what?
We should continue this.

11:34.677 --> 11:36.668
Let's have a dinner party.

11:36.846 --> 11:40.976
Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas.
I'll be happy to host.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.249
- Say tonight, maybe?
- It's good for me. Jenna?

11:44.420 --> 11:47.116
- No, I don't know if tonight works...
- Yeah, I'm free.

11:48.691 --> 11:50.249
It would be a pleasure.

11:50.426 --> 11:52.155
Great.

12:03.839 --> 12:06.933
Drink up. Good girl.

12:08.177 --> 12:10.611
I come bearing gifts.

12:10.780 --> 12:14.307
I didn't have time to properly shop,
but I did get a couple things.

12:15.851 --> 12:17.045
Hmm?

12:22.625 --> 12:24.183
Wow, that blood did the trick.

12:25.861 --> 12:27.726
You're almost pretty again.

12:27.930 --> 12:29.557
What is it you want, Damon?

12:30.366 --> 12:31.663
Guess who's back in town.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.534
Your old friend John Gilbert.

12:35.037 --> 12:36.698
Really?
- Mm-hm.

12:36.872 --> 12:39.363
- Why?
- Said he loves his daughter.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.567
Wants to protect her
from Elijah and Klaus.

12:41.744 --> 12:43.712
- Touching.
- Yeah, right?

12:43.879 --> 12:46.905
Told me this old wives' tale
about how to kill an Original.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.312
And you wanna know if it's true.

12:49.485 --> 12:53.080
If it was, I wouldn't tell you.

12:53.255 --> 12:57.555
Now, why not? I mean, you want Elijah
and Klaus dead as much as I do.

12:57.726 --> 13:01.025
Klaus, yes. Elijah, no.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.724
He's compelled me to stay in here.
If he dies, I'm stuck forever.

13:04.900 --> 13:05.992
Sucks for you.

13:06.168 --> 13:10.867
Forget it, Damon. Killing Elijah would be
a suicide mission. You can't do it.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.372
- Can so.
- Can't.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.102
Even with the dagger
and a little white oak ash?

13:20.983 --> 13:23.110
No, Damon.

13:23.285 --> 13:27.187
If you kill Elijah,
then I'm stuck in here forever.

13:27.523 --> 13:29.047
You're really scared.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.591
Get me out of here first,
and then I'll help you.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.854
I'll help you kill Elijah or protect Elena,
whatever you want.

13:35.030 --> 13:38.022
I get you out and your ass
is sipping Klaus-free margaritas...

13:38.200 --> 13:41.192
...on some unknown island somewhere.
No way.

13:41.370 --> 13:44.806
That's not true. I'll stay.
Damon, please, just don't do it.

13:45.007 --> 13:46.269
Well, thank you.

13:46.442 --> 13:48.535
You've told me everything
I need to know.

13:48.711 --> 13:50.303
- I've told you nothing.
- You have.

13:50.513 --> 13:53.949
You have indeed confirmed
that it is possible to kill an Original.

13:54.116 --> 13:56.107
Which I will do tonight.

13:59.522 --> 14:01.046
Guess who's coming to dinner.

14:05.361 --> 14:09.263
For weeks, I kept spiraling. Completely
driven by the desire for blood.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.567
Hunt, prey, kill. That was all I knew.

14:14.737 --> 14:17.205
How come no one caught on
to what you were doing?

14:17.373 --> 14:18.465
Hmm.

14:19.575 --> 14:20.872
There was a war going on.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.706
<i>Thing about wartime?</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:28.140
<i>Endless anonymous blood supply.</i>

15:19.101 --> 15:21.160
What kind of an idiot are you?

15:23.072 --> 15:26.633
<i>Alexia Branson,</i>
<i>as she was known back then.</i>

15:26.809 --> 15:30.643
Lexi? Your best friend, Lexi?
That's how you met her?

15:32.114 --> 15:34.548
Well, what was she even doing
in Mystic Falls?

15:34.717 --> 15:37.515
She had heard it was a good place
for vampires to go.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.211
Had no idea
that they'd all been massacred.

15:40.389 --> 15:43.825
Needed a place to crash,
so I brought her home with me.

15:47.096 --> 15:50.497
I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in,
but you did try to eat me...

15:50.666 --> 15:53.897
...and, well, with dawn coming,
beggars can't be choosers.

15:57.406 --> 15:58.998
Or should they be?

15:59.174 --> 16:03.804
I, um... I meant to dispose of those.

16:03.979 --> 16:05.708
- My God, you're a ripper.
- A what?

16:05.881 --> 16:10.250
There are good parts of being a vampire
and there are bad parts.

16:10.419 --> 16:11.511
You're the bad parts.

16:13.822 --> 16:15.414
Well...

16:16.825 --> 16:19.123
...we're going to have to change that.

16:22.031 --> 16:23.055
You okay?

16:26.135 --> 16:30.037
Talking about her brings up things
that I'd, uh, rather forget.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.165
Like Damon killing her?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.409
So, what's going on
with you and Alaric?

16:42.951 --> 16:47.149
- I feel like there's some tension.
- I don't know.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.919
- I really like him.
- Mm-hm.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.418
It's more than like.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.587
And I want it to work...

16:56.765 --> 16:59.256
...but I can't help but feel
he's hiding something.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.461
And then I've got John whispering things
in my ear about him.

17:02.671 --> 17:06.367
- Like what?
- Things I don't wanna believe.

17:07.076 --> 17:10.375
Things I don't believe, not if they're
coming from John's mouth.

17:10.546 --> 17:14.107
Oh, well, there you go, then.
Trust is the key to any relationship.

17:14.282 --> 17:18.083
I mean, I am so grateful
that Damon tells me everything.

17:20.422 --> 17:24.483
- You know, this is a bad idea.
- There's no such thing as a bad idea...

17:24.693 --> 17:28.959
...just poorly executed awesome ones.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.827
- Here.
- No. I don't like the idea of Elijah...

17:32.000 --> 17:34.628
...being in the same house with Jenna.
- Jenna's safe.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.828
Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission.

17:37.005 --> 17:39.496
- It's totally harmless.
- Just a fact-finding mission?

17:39.708 --> 17:40.970
Yeah.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.735
Listen.

17:42.911 --> 17:46.244
No sneak attacks, no surprise plans.
Nothing that's gonna put Jenna...

17:46.415 --> 17:48.440
...in harm's way, okay?
- Scout's honor.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.977
Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.

17:55.858 --> 17:57.291
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.829
Okay.

18:08.737 --> 18:11.865
- What's that?
- Dessert.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.269
Elijah's stronger than me.

18:17.946 --> 18:20.847
He's faster than me.
It's all about the element of surprise.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.782
Well, that's too bad. I like him.
He's very old-school classy.

18:24.953 --> 18:27.353
Which is why you should encourage
the gentlemen...

18:27.523 --> 18:29.286
...to take their drinks in here...

18:29.458 --> 18:31.926
...while you do coffee in the kitchen
with the girls.

18:32.094 --> 18:33.118
Hmm...

18:33.295 --> 18:36.628
That is a little too sexist for me.

18:37.833 --> 18:38.993
Stop talking.

18:43.639 --> 18:48.702
- Who invited him?
- John. What a surprise. Leave.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.209
Jenna told me she was coming
to a party for Elijah.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
I decided I couldn't miss out
on the fun games.

18:53.682 --> 18:55.741
There are not gonna be
any games tonight.

18:55.918 --> 18:59.319
- It's just a friendly dinner party.
- Right.

19:00.589 --> 19:01.681
What he said.

19:02.825 --> 19:04.690
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:04.860 --> 19:06.725
- Thanks. Thing weighs a ton.
- Ha, ha.

19:06.895 --> 19:10.922
I'm starving.
Do you guys have any food?

19:12.301 --> 19:15.327
Oh, God, ha, ha. This is a date.

19:16.205 --> 19:18.696
No, no, it's not like a "date" date.

19:18.874 --> 19:24.073
It's more of a, "Hey, I kissed you
and I thought you liked it," um, hang thing.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.205
Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena's cool
with us before anything else happens.

19:29.384 --> 19:33.081
I didn't realize my sister
had approval over who I'm with.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.382
She's my best friend.
I tell her everything.

19:35.557 --> 19:39.425
And this whole hang thing
might freak her out.

19:41.063 --> 19:45.932
All right. All right. So we'II, um, hang out,
eat some food, uh, work on some spells.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.899
- It's not a big deal.
- Cool.

19:50.339 --> 19:52.068
But you did...?

19:52.641 --> 19:54.370
You did like it, right?

19:56.211 --> 19:58.873
Yeah. I liked it.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.584
- Good evening.
- Thank you for coming. Please, come in.

20:06.755 --> 20:08.222
Just one moment.

20:09.858 --> 20:13.589
Can I just say that if you have
less-than-honorable intentions...

20:13.762 --> 20:17.425
...about how this evening is going
to proceed, I suggest you reconsider.

20:17.599 --> 20:22.161
No, nothing dishonorable.
Just, uh, getting to know you.

20:22.337 --> 20:23.497
Hmm.

20:23.672 --> 20:25.640
- That's good.
- Yeah.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.470
Because, you know,
although Elena and I have this deal...

20:29.978 --> 20:32.105
...if you so much as make a move
to cross me...

20:32.281 --> 20:35.978
...I'll kill you and I'll kill everyone
in this house. Are we clear?

20:36.618 --> 20:37.676
Crystal.

20:38.921 --> 20:40.047
Jenna.

20:40.222 --> 20:42.656
- Wonderful to see you. How are you?
- Nice to see you.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.815
- You look incredible.
- Thank you.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.658
I hate to break it to you,
but according to Elijah...

20:50.832 --> 20:52.925
...your family is so not a founder
of this town.

20:53.101 --> 20:57.265
- Hmm, do tell.
- Well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier...

20:57.439 --> 21:01.375
...a faction of settlers migrated from
Salem after the witch trials in the 1690s.

21:01.543 --> 21:05.502
They developed this community where
they could feel safe from the persecution.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.205
Hmm, because they were witches.

21:07.416 --> 21:10.044
There's no tangible proof
there were witches in Salem.

21:10.218 --> 21:12.948
Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.

21:13.121 --> 21:17.785
Well, the lore says that there was
this wave of anti-witch hysteria.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.726
Broke out in the neighboring settlement.
So these witches were rounded up.

21:21.930 --> 21:26.060
They were tied to stakes
in a field together and, uh, burned.

21:26.234 --> 21:29.635
You could hear the screams for miles
as they were consumed by the fire.

21:29.805 --> 21:30.863
Could you pass the...?

21:31.039 --> 21:33.872
I, uh, wouldn't repeat this
to the historical society.

21:35.310 --> 21:38.245
It's starting to sound
a little like a ghost story to me.

21:40.816 --> 21:44.582
So why do you wanna know the location
of these alleged massacres?

21:46.855 --> 21:51.019
You know, healthy historian's curiosity,
of course.

21:51.593 --> 21:52.685
Of course.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.035
Jonathan Gilbert
got crazier and crazier.

22:01.203 --> 22:05.469
Guess that's what happens when you
spend your life obsessed with vampires.

22:12.781 --> 22:15.375
He researched the Originals.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.978
- You're kidding.
- Later in life. Look.

22:19.521 --> 22:24.982
Pages and pages of questions
and scribbles.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.123
What's that?

22:29.297 --> 22:33.597
"The wood from one tree and
one tree alone, an ancient white oak...

22:33.769 --> 22:36.135
...would bring death
to an Original vampire.

22:36.304 --> 22:38.898
When the tree burned,
all hope was thought lost."

22:42.044 --> 22:45.013
He was trying to figure out
how to kill an Original.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.050
"But the ash from the tree
was saved...

22:50.218 --> 22:53.278
...and witches forged a dagger
to which the ash could be bonded.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.117
This alchemic bond provides
the necessary poison..."

22:56.291 --> 22:57.383
Elena.

22:57.559 --> 23:01.256
I wonder if this is true. I mean,
do you think this dagger actually exists?

23:01.430 --> 23:03.261
I know it does.

23:03.899 --> 23:05.389
Because John gave it to Damon.

23:06.735 --> 23:11.900
John gave Damon the weapon
that's supposed to kill Elijah? This one?

23:14.976 --> 23:16.739
"It must be brandished by humans...

23:16.912 --> 23:19.642
...for it will bring death to all demons
who wield it."

23:21.149 --> 23:23.140
John's trying to get Damon killed.

23:25.587 --> 23:29.284
Would anyone care for some cognac?
I have a bottle I've been saving for ages.

23:29.458 --> 23:30.652
None for me, thanks.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.556
- Nine bottles of wine is my limit.
- Ha, ha.

23:33.728 --> 23:36.993
- Why is your phone off? Call me.
- What's going on, Stefan?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.963
Damon is planning on killing Elijah.

23:41.970 --> 23:43.062
Tonight.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.939
The gentlemen should take their drinks
in the study.

23:49.111 --> 23:52.638
I have to say the food was almost
as wonderful as the company.

23:52.814 --> 23:54.873
I like you.

23:57.486 --> 24:00.717
You're not a gentleman.
Make yourself useful. Hmm?

24:02.891 --> 24:06.088
- Here, here. Put me to work.
- Um, I got it.

24:07.195 --> 24:10.858
- Hey, Jenna. Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine, Ric.

24:15.036 --> 24:19.166
- I suspect this is my fault.
- What did you do now?

24:19.341 --> 24:22.799
I mentioned you haven't been
completely honest about your dead wife.

24:22.978 --> 24:24.411
You son of a bitch.

24:25.547 --> 24:29.608
I think I've been very clear with you, Ric.
I want my ring back.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.912
Hello?

24:35.123 --> 24:38.320
Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow... Stefan?

24:38.493 --> 24:40.051
So let me guess.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.696
In addition to the moonstone,
doppelganger...

24:42.864 --> 24:45.697
...the lion,
the witch and the wardrobe...

24:46.168 --> 24:48.329
...you need to find
this witch burial ground?

24:48.503 --> 24:53.031
Because I feel as though we've grown
so close, Damon, I'll tell you yes.

24:54.843 --> 24:57.437
- Do you know where it is?
- Maybe.

25:00.949 --> 25:03.543
- Tell me why it's so important.
- We're not that close.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.522
This is quite a collection
you have here.

25:08.690 --> 25:09.782
Hmm.

25:09.958 --> 25:13.018
Here's a funny thing about books.

25:13.395 --> 25:15.761
Before they existed,
people actually had memories.

25:20.068 --> 25:21.865
Gentlemen.

25:22.037 --> 25:23.971
We forgot about dessert.

25:25.473 --> 25:28.374
- Elijah.
- Ms. Star.

25:32.714 --> 25:34.113
Ah.

25:36.918 --> 25:38.385
What?

25:55.270 --> 25:57.761
Sorry, guys. Dessert is taking longer
than I thought.

25:57.939 --> 25:59.964
I usually just unwrap food.

26:04.079 --> 26:07.139
So I know this is a social thing...

26:07.315 --> 26:11.115
...but I'd really love to ask you some
questions about the work you're doing.

26:11.286 --> 26:14.084
- I'd love to answer.
- Great. Oh, that's so great.

26:14.256 --> 26:17.714
Ric, would you do me a favor
and grab the notebook out of my bag?

26:18.426 --> 26:22.328
Elijah, did John tell you
that he's Elena's uncle/father?

26:22.497 --> 26:25.295
- Yes, I'm well aware of that.
- Of course, she hates him.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.664
There's no need to keep him
on the endangered species list.

26:28.837 --> 26:32.967
Ric, it's in the front pocket, on the...
You know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.

26:33.141 --> 26:36.975
What I'd like to know, Elijah,
is how you intend on killing Klaus.

26:37.145 --> 26:41.241
Gentlemen, there's a few things
we should probably get clear right now.

26:42.751 --> 26:45.379
I allow you to live
solely to keep an eye on Elena.

26:45.553 --> 26:48.181
I allow Elena to remain in her house...

26:48.356 --> 26:51.291
...living her life with her friends
as she does as a courtesy.

26:51.459 --> 26:55.327
If you become a liability, I'll take her away
from you. You'll never see her again.

26:55.497 --> 27:00.901
Okay, my first question is,
when you got here to Mystic...

27:24.926 --> 27:28.054
Now get rid of him
before Jenna comes back with dessert.

27:29.030 --> 27:30.054
All right.

27:40.275 --> 27:41.674
We need to talk about this.

27:41.843 --> 27:45.973
What good is talking if you and Damon
are just gonna lie to me?

27:46.614 --> 27:48.514
If you don't like my decisions, fine.

27:48.717 --> 27:52.016
There's nothing I can do.
But if you ever go behind my back, I'Il...

27:52.220 --> 27:54.814
- What? Hmm? What are you gonna do?
- It's my life.

27:54.989 --> 27:58.789
Exactly. It's your life. I'm gonna
do everything I can to make sure you live it.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.487
So, what, this trip through the past,
you being honest...

28:02.664 --> 28:05.326
...was there any truth to that
or were you distracting me?

28:05.500 --> 28:08.663
I was telling you about a time
when I had given up.

28:08.837 --> 28:11.032
- That is what you're doing now.
- That is not...

28:11.206 --> 28:14.505
Yes, it is, even if you don't wanna admit it.
You are giving up.

28:14.676 --> 28:19.045
And Lexi, she wouldn't let me give up.
I'm not gonna let you.

28:22.183 --> 28:27.780
All of these men are dead or dying.
What does that make you feel?

28:28.890 --> 28:30.050
Nothing. I feel nothing.

28:30.258 --> 28:32.726
Because you shut off the part of you
that was human.

28:32.894 --> 28:35.385
- The part that lets you feel.
- Ha, ha, is that not the point?

28:35.563 --> 28:38.657
Well, there is a better way.
You simply have to want it.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.025
Is it better?

28:40.201 --> 28:42.829
Not at first.
You can't choose what you feel.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.199
You have to let it all back in.

28:45.373 --> 28:48.570
The pain. The look in their eyes
when you took their life.

28:48.777 --> 28:51.245
- The cries of their loved ones.
- Why would I do that? Hmm?

28:51.413 --> 28:54.041
Because once you can hurt,
you can love.

28:57.085 --> 29:00.486
Love, Stefan. That's the point.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.323
Everything is intensified
when you're a vampire.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.552
When we hurt, we really hurt.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.793
But when we love...

29:18.573 --> 29:21.701
Lexi showed me
that there was another way.

29:22.610 --> 29:25.579
And from that day forward,
I started fighting for it.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.873
For my own survival.

29:34.622 --> 29:38.251
That's all I want you to do.
I just want you to fight for it.

29:57.846 --> 30:00.576
You said there wasn't gonna be
any violence.

30:00.748 --> 30:03.546
- Says the guy that did all the killing.
- I took the shot...

30:03.718 --> 30:06.812
...because I saw an opening,
not because I planned this.

30:06.988 --> 30:10.480
Now, you can't lie to me like that.
Hey, I am your friend, damn it.

30:10.658 --> 30:15.152
And you don't have any friends.
So no more lying.

30:29.878 --> 30:30.936
Elijah's dead.

30:34.282 --> 30:36.147
Alaric did it.

30:42.457 --> 30:45.017
Originals believed in truth and honor.

30:45.193 --> 30:48.162
It was forbidden for a vampire
to kill another vampire.

30:48.329 --> 30:52.527
So the dagger would take both lives.

30:52.700 --> 30:56.966
And as long as the dagger
stays in place...

30:57.138 --> 31:00.005
...the Original is,
for all intents and purposes, dead.

31:10.919 --> 31:13.683
- What happened?
- I need you to find Elena.

31:15.924 --> 31:17.414
Now.

31:31.773 --> 31:33.968
Now, that is cool. How does it work?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.268
It's called channeling.

31:35.443 --> 31:37.070
Siphoning power from something.

31:37.245 --> 31:40.737
Another witch, the moon, an element.

31:40.915 --> 31:42.610
Technically, you could channel me.

31:43.451 --> 31:47.888
What? Well, I'm an element, sort of.
Isn't the human body mostly water?

31:49.991 --> 31:51.549
You're right.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.390
Let's see what happens.

32:12.146 --> 32:15.013
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Jeremy.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.812
What did my son tell you?
What did he tell you?

32:20.254 --> 32:23.417
Told me about your daughter.
I know Klaus has her.

32:23.591 --> 32:27.527
I wanna help you get her back.
I want us to work together. Please.

32:27.695 --> 32:30.323
This is for your own good.

32:32.266 --> 32:33.563
No. No.

32:46.114 --> 32:49.049
If any harm comes to my son
because of what you did...

32:49.217 --> 32:50.479
...you will answer to me.

33:01.929 --> 33:05.922
Hey. It's okay. All right. It's okay.

33:07.468 --> 33:08.935
What happened?

33:10.505 --> 33:12.735
He took my powers.

33:30.191 --> 33:32.022
Hey, hey.

33:38.966 --> 33:40.228
He's here.

33:54.482 --> 33:56.677
- Go. I need to talk to him alone.
- Elena.

33:56.851 --> 33:58.944
I'm okay. He can't come in the house.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.556
You know, I might not be able
to enter this house...

34:04.225 --> 34:06.523
...but I am a very patient man.

34:07.528 --> 34:09.188
I'll wait you out.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.771
- Shouldn't have done what they did.
- The deal is off.

34:28.949 --> 34:33.148
- I'm renegotiating.
- You have nothing left to negotiate with.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.764
I'd like to see you lure Klaus
into Mystic Falls...

34:45.933 --> 34:49.562
...after the doppelganger bleeds to death.
- Stefan won't let you die.

34:49.737 --> 34:53.297
No, he won't.
He'll feed me his blood to heal me.

34:53.474 --> 34:57.467
And then I'll kill myself and become
a vampire, just like Katherine did.

34:59.547 --> 35:02.812
Unless you want that to happen again,
promise me the same as before.

35:02.984 --> 35:07.250
Promise me that you won't harm
anyone that I love.

35:07.421 --> 35:09.184
Even if they've harmed you.

35:16.664 --> 35:18.598
I'm sorry, Elena.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.466
I'm going to have to call your bluff.

35:39.287 --> 35:40.379
No!

35:47.695 --> 35:50.027
Yes. Yes, you can have your deal.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.097
- Let me heal you.
- Give me your word.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.027
I give you my word.

36:21.395 --> 36:22.487
Little tip.

36:25.066 --> 36:26.829
Don't pull the dagger out.

36:36.210 --> 36:38.474
Where did John disappear to?

36:40.114 --> 36:44.073
Uh, maybe the same place
the rest of the dinner party ran off to.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.283
Look, Jenna, I'm, uh...

36:47.088 --> 36:49.215
- I'm so sorry tonight...
- What happened to Isobel?

36:50.958 --> 36:53.188
You know, John should've never
brought that up.

36:53.361 --> 36:56.159
- That's not an answer.
- He's trying to stir trouble.

36:56.330 --> 36:57.695
That's not an answer either.

36:57.865 --> 36:59.355
I can't talk about this, Jenna.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.228
I keep thinking that maybe it's me.

37:01.402 --> 37:03.768
Maybe I'm reading into things.

37:04.538 --> 37:08.372
I should trust you.
That's what a relationship is about, right?

37:10.044 --> 37:12.877
But then I think that maybe John is right
and maybe...

37:13.047 --> 37:16.881
...you're not being honest with me, so...

37:17.885 --> 37:19.580
...are you being honest?

37:30.564 --> 37:32.862
Right. Okay.

37:38.539 --> 37:39.801
That was an answer.

37:47.381 --> 37:48.507
Well, that was awkward.

37:56.891 --> 37:59.724
You know, I can clear this stuff up
about Isobel tomorrow.

37:59.894 --> 38:01.657
If you want.

38:01.829 --> 38:03.626
Or not.

38:15.276 --> 38:19.178
You want it? Take it. It's yours.

38:19.347 --> 38:21.975
And after what you did to Damon...

38:24.552 --> 38:26.315
...you're gonna need it more than me.

38:41.602 --> 38:43.661
What do we have here?

38:43.838 --> 38:45.965
Our little moonstone bar of soap.

38:47.008 --> 38:48.873
I'll hold on to this.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.202
So that's it?

38:50.378 --> 38:54.940
I mean, as long as we keep
the dagger in there, then he stays dead?

38:55.116 --> 38:58.347
- Pretty much.
- Okay, then.

38:59.387 --> 39:01.218
Good night.

39:01.956 --> 39:06.893
You know, you guys want me to fight,
fine, I'll fight.

39:07.094 --> 39:10.689
But if we're gonna do this, you can't
keep anything from me anymore.

39:11.465 --> 39:13.797
From this moment on,
we're doing it my way.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.663
Seems fair.

39:22.243 --> 39:23.835
Okay.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.670
Okay.

39:29.250 --> 39:31.343
Seems like
she's had a change of attitude.

39:31.519 --> 39:32.918
How'd you get through to her?

39:34.655 --> 39:36.555
Told her a little story...

39:36.724 --> 39:39.090
...about when I was making
the wrong decisions...

39:39.260 --> 39:41.888
...and somebody showed me
there was a better way.

39:42.396 --> 39:43.761
Lexi?

39:43.931 --> 39:45.262
Yeah.

39:46.734 --> 39:48.258
You remember her?

40:03.084 --> 40:05.075
Going somewhere?

40:08.722 --> 40:11.885
You must be the vampire
I hear my brother complaining about.

40:12.059 --> 40:13.549
That would be me.

40:13.727 --> 40:16.696
And you must be the brother
who hates him.

40:20.568 --> 40:23.162
We are at irreparable odds.

40:23.971 --> 40:27.429
You know the hate you're feeling
towards Stefan, towards everyone?

40:27.608 --> 40:30.702
You think you have it under control,
but you don't.

40:31.412 --> 40:32.936
It will get the best of you.

40:38.385 --> 40:40.250
Help him.

40:41.288 --> 40:42.380
He needs it.

40:44.225 --> 40:46.056
I'll help him.

40:53.834 --> 40:57.270
Andie? Thought you left.

41:08.282 --> 41:09.340
Hello, Damon.

41:11.652 --> 41:13.711
Hey, do you have a robe?

41:18.259 --> 41:19.487
How did you get out?

41:21.095 --> 41:25.259
I knew that if I begged you not to
kill Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do.

41:25.432 --> 41:27.093
Little known fact?

41:27.268 --> 41:29.259
Originals can compel vampires...

41:29.436 --> 41:34.135
...but soon as they die,
compulsion wears off.

41:34.308 --> 41:36.003
And you knew.

41:36.177 --> 41:38.543
And I'm still here.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.304
I didn't run.

41:40.481 --> 41:44.110
Meant what I said, Damon.
I'm going to help you.

41:48.355 --> 41:49.379
So...

41:51.192 --> 41:52.682
...how about that robe?

41:53.305 --> 41:59.945
