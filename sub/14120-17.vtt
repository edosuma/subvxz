00:09.777 --> 00:12.478
Everybody, come outside.
My new vanity plates are here.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.580
Didn't you just
get vanity plates?

00:14.582 --> 00:17.416
Yeah, now that I'm not
a vegetarian anymore,

00:17.418 --> 00:18.550
I need new ones.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.153
Oh, my God.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.821
Why does it say that?

Or for short, "Bisexual."

00:36.704 --> 00:39.371
Oh, damn! We can't put these
on a mystery mobile!

00:39.373 --> 00:40.939
It's false advertisement,

00:40.941 --> 00:42.775
unless one of you
are bisexual.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.676
-Yung?
-I'm not bisexual.

00:44.678 --> 00:47.780
Yung, why must you constantly
be disappointing us?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.518
Uh, okay. Who wants to hear
the new mystery, hmm?

he might be a bisexual.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.706
You can give him,
you can give him your plates.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.209
I mean, probably not.
Probably, just a gay guy.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.545
But there's a chance.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.681
MIKE: Welcome to Bennington,
everybody!

01:22.683 --> 01:25.751
Oh, we should all get coats
here at the coat factory.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.019
You mean Burlington?

01:27.021 --> 01:28.887
Right, Burlington
Coat Factory, yes.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.389
Mmm, this is Bennington.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.724
Yeah, that's what I said.
Bennington Coat Factory.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.427
No, one is Burlington
and one is Bennington.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.163
They got two coat factories?
Which one came first?

01:38.165 --> 01:39.631
Shit.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.301
I bet whoever it is,
is pissed at the second one.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.838
Man, I'm not a lawyer but
I bet they can sue
the shirts off of them.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.607
Then I bet the other one
would just be like,
"(BLEEP) that, man.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.509
"We sell different coats
than you do.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.211

01:55.649 --> 01:57.349
Unfortunately, yes.

most excited to do in Vermont?

02:00.187 --> 02:02.354

I would, but I put mine

Any idea why
I pulled you over today?

03:20.134 --> 03:21.700

has to do with anything,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.881
Does anyone want a souffle?
I need a souffle.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.783
Those do take
about 45 minutes.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.484
That's fine. We're in no rush.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.920
So what's going on?
What's the mystery?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.555
(SIGHS) Okay.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.957
What is the one thing you're
never supposed to do
in a theater?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.092
BOTH: Jack off.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.428
Yes but no.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.763
It's never speak the name,
"Macbeth."

07:11.765 --> 07:14.232
Otherwise,
you'll invite disaster.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.767
Didn't you just say Macbeth?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.170
Oh, (BLEEP)
I just said Macbeth.

07:18.172 --> 07:21.506
No, it's only if you say it
inside the theater.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.375
That's why I took you
to this restaurant.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.343
Well, and I've had
to eat today

07:25.345 --> 07:27.546
is a pack of gum
and a buttered lobster.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.780
(CHUCKLES) Don't tell my wife.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.949
-What? Your wife?
-Yes.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.952
So, you think someone
in the cast said, "Macbeth"?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.422
Well, we'd have nothing
but bad luck since
our first rehearsal.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.725
A stage light fell. On the way
home from the theater.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.361
Howard nearly got into
a fender-bender.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.497
The light in the women's
bathroom went out.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.998
Just totally out.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.634
So that's two lights that
we've had trouble with.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.303
So that's got to mean
something.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.571
So what do you want us to do?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.206
Find out who said it.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.641
And you just can't ask
the cast directly.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.043
They're actors.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.812
They're always playing a part.
They're lying.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.380
You'll never know it because

08:02.382 --> 08:06.351
we're taking about some of
the finest actors out there.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.953
Some true gems.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.693
It's not your fault, honey.

to be totally immersed in it.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.652
Brad doesn't get any
of the subtext,

08:40.654 --> 08:43.822
but that's why it's
called "rehearsal!"

08:43.824 --> 08:45.257
<i>Come, let me clutch thee!</i>

08:45.259 --> 08:47.526
<i>I have thee not,</i>
<i>and yet I see thee still.</i>

08:47.528 --> 08:50.729
<i>Stop, stop, stop, Brad.</i>
<i>Brad, stop.</i>

08:50.731 --> 08:53.064
<i>Who are you? Who is this?</i>

08:53.066 --> 08:56.268
<i>Because I sure as hell</i>
<i>am not seeing Macbeth.</i>

08:56.270 --> 08:58.904
<i>But I cast you as Macbeth,</i>
<i>in the play</i> Macbeth.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.574
<i>So for</i> (BLEEP) <i> sake,</i>
<i>give me Macbeth!</i>

09:02.576 --> 09:07.012
<i>How many</i> (BLEEPING) <i> times</i>
<i>do I have to say Macbeth</i>
<i>in this theater</i>

09:07.014 --> 09:10.448
<i>before you start acting</i>
<i>like Macbeth, Hmm?</i>

09:10.450 --> 09:12.751
<i>Macbeth. Huh?</i>
<i>Macbeth...</i>

09:12.753 --> 09:14.886
-(BLEEPING) <i> Mac...</i>
-(TURNS OFF RADIO)

09:14.888 --> 09:17.689
Hmm, I guess that solves that.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.726
PIGEON: (EXHALES)
Well, it wasn't a total waste.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.062
We had all those good salads.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.935
Hold on. First we have to
reverse the curse.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.305
Now this is an old theater
tradition. So, bear with me.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.642
(SING-SONGY)
Thrice around
the circle bound,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.111
evil sink into the ground.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.313
Oh, my God.

09:44.483 --> 09:45.917
There!

09:49.922 --> 09:52.924
Good news, everyone.
The curse has been lifted.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.060
Our nightmare is finally over.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.269
-MIKE: What the (BLEEP)
-(JULES GASPS)

10:04.271 --> 10:05.537
The Bard's curse.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.672
I didn't lift it in time.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.709
(SOBBING)

10:12.311 --> 10:14.679
(MARQUESS SOBBING)

10:20.219 --> 10:23.254
(SOFTLY) I killed them.
I killed all the demons.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.990
Just like the voices
told me to.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.559
(SNIGGERING)
You sure did, buddy.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.695
You got rid of all the demons.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.097
(MARQUESS SOBS)

10:40.740 --> 10:43.775
(MOANING)

10:43.777 --> 10:45.877
I feel like I slept
for ten hours.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.379
(SIGHS) Thank God!

10:47.381 --> 10:50.115
I think that stuff is finally
out of my system.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.685
Please tell me I didn't do
anything crazy while
I was on it.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.356
-No, uh-uh. No.
-MARQUESS: Ah, good.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.291
What about all the people
he killed?

11:01.727 --> 11:04.929
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING
AND WHISTLING)

11:09.602 --> 11:11.903
Me? Oh, this is so wondrous.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.806
Genevieve, you pulled it out.
I knew you would.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.175
I am sorry I yelled, but
it always turns around!

11:17.177 --> 11:20.478
Everyone, this is for you
and for me, more.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.414
But thank you. Thank me.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.815
Thank you.
