I was supposed to bethe guest speaker at mia's
school today, but I have togo out of town.

Yikes.

Do you know anythingabout wine?

01:30.700 --> 01:34.690
Wine is fine,but whiskey is quicker.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.690
Suicide is slowwith liquor.

Californication
Season 1 Episode 06

03:51.700 --> 03:53.990
I fucking love vinyl.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.990
Yeah, it just sounds better.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.190
It's warmer, right?It's just human.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.490
You're just an analog guy in
a digital world, aren't you?

04:05.500 --> 04:07.790
I might steal that.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.890
What is your name, by the way?

04:13.600 --> 04:17.490
Wouldn't you rather just
fuck me and never know?

04:17.500 --> 04:21.290
Oh, fuck.Who says romance is dead?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.990
Oh, shit.You again?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.490
Fuck me.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.090
- All right, sure.
- Stop it.I've been robbed.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.690
Save the dramafor your mama.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.190
She stole my guitar...and my records.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.590
My records!Oh, the humanity!

05:22.600 --> 05:25.590
- Who did this?
- I don't know.Some girl.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.990
She let you have access tothe
most intimate of her areas,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.490
and she didn't give youher name?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.890
Well, it seemed like a
prettyfair trade-off at the time.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.490
You should have seen
her.What do you want?

05:33.500 --> 05:39.090
Peace in the middle east,a two-hour
orgasm, a few pagesof your lesser work.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.390
That is not possible.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.690
There is no such thingas a
two-hour orgasm or my lesser work.

05:45.100 --> 05:45.600
- No.
- No?

05:45.610 --> 05:46.490
- Yes.
- Yes?

05:46.500 --> 05:50.490
Yes -- no,if you want lesser
work, just write somethingyourself.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.290
I can'T.I'm lazy.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.290
- I'll say.
- I'll cry rape.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.290
No, you won'T.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.190
How do you know?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.990
'Cause you enjoy torturing
meentirely too much.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.690
That's true.

06:00.700 --> 06:05.390
Okay, listen,you just write
something -- anything --

06:05.400 --> 06:07.890
okay,and I will help you with it.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.090
I'll give you notes.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.090
- Really?
- Yes.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.690
- You'd do thatfor me?
- Of course.Why wouldn't I?

06:13.700 --> 06:19.090
My own fatherhasn't even so much as
offered to help mewith my homework, so...

06:19.100 --> 06:23.190
you know,as much as I love to hear
about bill's failingsas a parent,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.590
I do notlike to be compared
to him in the same sentence.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.790
It kind of creeps me out.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.690
Given that you'vebeen
inside of me and all?

06:29.700 --> 06:32.990
Something like that,okay.Now,
you're a smartlittle sociopath.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.690
I'm sure you canput two
sentences together.Now scram.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.390
You wanted me?

06:42.400 --> 06:46.790
you know, I -- I dropped an advilon
the floor earlier and couldn't find it.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.890
I thoughtmaybe you could...

06:48.900 --> 06:51.490
crawl aroundand look for it.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.090
Whatever you say, boss.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.290
Go slowly.I don't want
youto miss anything.

07:00.300 --> 07:05.290
Yes, boss.Maybe I
shouldlook more closely.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.490
Poor you.Your head must be throbbing.

07:12.500 --> 07:17.190
It -- it --it is
actually, a bit.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.890
Anybody home?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.490

just -- - found it.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.690
Thank you, dani.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.590
That's an advil.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.290
Oh, I'll just eat somethingat my desk.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.690
It was nice to see you,mrs.Runkle.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.590
She's like your little slave,that one.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.590
Uh,you want to get lunch?

08:15.300 --> 08:17.790
I'd rather get laid.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.890
I wanted out of there.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.090
You weren't in trouble.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.890
Sure I was.I was in dangerof
being bored to death.

14:04.900 --> 14:09.790
- You cried wolf.
- So?Maybe I justwanted to see you.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.190
Did you ever think that
maybeI did not want to see you.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.790
Never entered my mind.You
enjoy the banter too much.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.990

wasspending time with my daughter.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.290

14:23.300 --> 14:25.390
- Don't enjoy it too much,pal.
- Why not?

14:25.400 --> 14:27.490
Because she's marryingmy father.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.890
You don't even like the guy.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.190
What do you care?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.190
Yeah, maybe he's not
muchof a parental figure.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.490
It doesn't meanI don't
want to see him happy.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.790
And she makes him happy,hank.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.490

15:52.800 --> 15:54.990
I apologize.Good night.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.890
Do you want to come infor a drink?

16:12.000 --> 16:18.390
So, uh, did danisay anything to you
about our littleafternoon session?

16:19.100 --> 16:23.290
- No.No.
- No?

16:23.300 --> 16:25.590
Well, I mean,even if she heard,

16:25.600 --> 16:28.690
it's not like I talk aboutmy
love life with my assistant.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.890
Okay.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.190
Although, I have to say,you know, when you
said that thingabout her being my slave,

16:38.200 --> 16:41.690
it -- it did get
mekind of thinking.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.390
Thinking about what?

16:43.400 --> 16:46.490
You know, um...role-playing.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.190
You know,master/slave,
dominance/submission,bondage.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.690
You know, we never
triedany of that stuff.

16:53.700 --> 16:58.390
I'm just trying to,you know, mix things
up a little bit,like you did today.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.090
Okay.Okay, I hear you.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.490
So, uh, do you want meto
beat the crap out of you?

17:10.300 --> 17:12.589
if you...if you want, I guess.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.490
Or, you know,I could beat
you up, whichever you prefer.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.990
Or nobody has tobeat anybody up.We
just -- there's a masterand a slave.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.089
And the slave does whateverthe
master tells her to.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.390
"Her" being me,your slave.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.490
In that example, yeah.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.590
Okay, so...

17:36.500 --> 17:38.790
What do you want meto do?

17:40.400 --> 17:43.390
you know,whatever
makes you happy, right?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.890
Maybe you want me to make you
wear a ball gagin your mouth.

17:46.900 --> 17:51.690
Or maybe you would want meto drip
hot candle wax on your nipples.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.090
Or maybe you liketo be teased, right?

17:54.100 --> 17:57.990
I could bring youto the brink of
orgasm without everletting you come.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.690
I feel likewe've done that.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.390
All right, maybe --maybe
you want me to pee on you.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.190
Why would I want youto pee on me?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.590
I don't know.I just -- I know
there's peoplethat do that.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.190
Okay, that's all.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.390
Look, baby, I'm in.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.490
Just start doingsome shit to me.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.290
We'll see how it goes,okay?

18:24.100 --> 18:26.490
You know what, we shouldprobably
have a safe word, right,

18:26.500 --> 18:28.890
you know,so I know what your limits are.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.590
How about,"don't pee on me"?

18:32.600 --> 18:36.190
Okay,that should work.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.990
- God damn it!
- Sorry.Sorry.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.190
Okay, okay,let me rub it.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.790
- Don't touch it!
- Okay.

18:56.500 --> 19:03.890
What would you doif our little spawn
actually became,like, a rock star?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.190
I would be really proudof her.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.190
You would?

19:06.200 --> 19:08.990
And I would be there to help
pump her stomachwhen she od'D.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.490
Oh, god.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.890
Do you think she's ever...

19:14.400 --> 19:17.790
do you thinkshe's ever smoked
pot?I mean,like, successfully.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.290
No, no, she told me that she
saw you and billget high once,

19:21.300 --> 19:26.890
and it so creeped her out that she
swore to meshe was never gonna try it.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.290
So,well done with that.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.690
- Bill
-- - yeah?

19:30.700 --> 19:34.790
Bill saw --he
saw a spider.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.990
A spider?

19:36.000 --> 19:41.190
That guy, he is the
biggestfucking pansy in captivity.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.990
You happy?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.390
- What?
- It's a simple question.Are you happy?

19:48.900 --> 19:50.590
I don't even knowwhat
that means anymore.

19:50.600 --> 19:56.090
All right, I'll --I'll make it
specific.Does billmake you happy?

19:56.100 --> 19:58.590
- Yes.
- Bullshit!No!

19:59.500 --> 20:02.090
- No, no!
- He does.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.190
- He makes me really happy.
- Like I made you happy?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.190
You made mefucking insane.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.790
Seriously,I never made you
happy?I made you insane?

20:08.800 --> 20:12.190
I mean, once upon a
time,you made me happy.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.290
But then you made me crazy, and
that was okay, too,for a while.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.390
But then I
--I evolved.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.890
You outgrew me.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.190
I understand.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.190
And I didn't?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.990
No, you stayed rightin the crazy zone.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.290
***

20:26.300 --> 20:29.890
Well,that is a hell of a way to
sum up a decade-longlove affair.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.090
Well, mr.Moody...

20:32.700 --> 20:34.590
how would you sum it up?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.290
I would saywe loved each other too much.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.590
Too much.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.090
And I thinkwe made the mistake
of getting it rightthe first time,

20:42.100 --> 20:47.090
and that put an insane amountof
pressure on us to keep it going.And...

20:47.100 --> 20:49.090
we buckled.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.490
You knowwhat I
miss most about --

20:52.500 --> 20:56.290
well, aside from becca,of course.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.590
I miss your smell.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.690
That's it?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.290
When you left,I couldn't wash the sheets

21:03.300 --> 21:06.990
because I didn't want tolose
that completely -- you.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.490
And it fucked me upfor a long time

21:09.500 --> 21:15.290
because I would wake upand I'd smell
you and I'd thinkyou were there.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.390
And that would -- my
heartwould break all over again.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.590
I think that's why I go
infor the kiss all the time.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.790
I know, yeah.I think I'm going for...

21:25.800 --> 21:27.790
another hit.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.790
Have you washedthose sheets yet?

21:31.100 --> 21:33.590
Oh, well, you know,I
had to throw them away.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.690
Oh, good.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.890
Yeah, this hotlittle starbucks
barista got her periodall over them.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.390
You're so fucking disgusting.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.490
You see?Look at that.You see?

21:43.500 --> 21:44.790
Why do youhave to say shit like that?

21:44.800 --> 21:48.490
If I can make youlaugh like
that, why can't we be together?

21:48.500 --> 21:49.990
That's whatI don't understand.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.890
You know what?You don't want to be with
me.You think --I know you think you do.

21:56.300 --> 22:00.290
But if I were togive myself to
you, you wouldrun for the hills,

22:00.300 --> 22:01.990
'cause you're notin love with me, hank.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.690
You're in love with the
idea --the idea of love.

22:07.700 --> 22:12.190
Now, on that brave,profound note,
I'm gonna goand get some coffee.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.790
How you can beso fucking
beautiful and so fucking wrong?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.690
- what?
- You're runningfor the hills.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.090
Yes, you are.

22:40.900 --> 22:45.590
Oh, my god!I'm sorry.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.690
Calm down, girly man.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.990
It's not like I blew youor anything.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.090
Get off of me.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.090
Hey, I'm taking you upon your offer.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.790
Read thisand give me notes.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.790
- Now?!
- Yeah.What else are you doing?

23:19.800 --> 23:21.490

23:21.500 --> 23:25.290
Too drunk to drive?Too limp to fuck?Does

Not so much...now.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.790
That's fine.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.690
I'm just a little raw.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.890
It's too soon for me.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.690

24:19.500 --> 24:21.690
Does my father have
anything to worry about?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.590
No more than usual.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.190
Oh, my god!You look so lame.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.690
Well, good,because that's exactly
the look that I'm going for.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.990
Have a seat.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.590
Don't mind if I do.

Pop-tarts?

25:11.700 --> 25:12.690

25:15.400 --> 25:21.490
I know.Yeah, we miss you, too.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.490
So much.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.490
When areyou coming back?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.490
Okay, uh-huh.Yeah.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.290
I've got to go.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.490
- I'll call you later.
- Bye.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.990
Bye-bye, mia.

25:38.300 --> 25:41.590
Yes, she's right here.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.190
What?

26:03.400 --> 26:07.590
"Rome is burning," he said, as
he poured himself another drink.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.690
"Yet here I am, knee-deep
in a river of pussy."

26:10.700 --> 26:13.090
"Here it comes," she thought,
"another self-indulgent,

26:13.100 --> 26:18.590
whiskey-soaked diatribe about how fucking
great everything was in the past...

26:18.600 --> 26:23.090
And how all us poor souls born too
late "to see the stones at wherever "

26:23.100 --> 26:26.390
or snort the good coke like
they had at studio 54, "

26:26.400 --> 26:31.090
well, we had all just missed out on
practically everything worth living for.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.190
" And the worst part
was, she agreed with him.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.890
I felt bad.

26:36.900 --> 26:40.990
You were so nice to me,and
I totally took advantage.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.490
So...

26:46.600 --> 26:49.990
do you want to get highand
listen to some records?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.690
by the way,my
name is --

26:59.200 --> 27:02.690
"here we are," she thought,
"at the edge of the world, "

27:02.700 --> 27:05.390
the very edge of western civilization,

27:05.400 --> 27:10.290
"and all of us are so desperate
to feel something, "anything,

27:10.300 --> 27:15.890
that we keep falling into each other and
fucking our way towards the end of days.
