00:14.687 --> 00:15.994
Oh, for the
love of...

00:16.585 --> 00:17.881
Huh?

00:20.877 --> 00:22.404
Ah, Halloween:

00:22.477 --> 00:25.689
the one night when we can walk
the streets undetected.

00:26.908 --> 00:28.094
Hey, lame-os.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.199
Turner Classic
Movies called.

00:30.302 --> 00:32.377
They want
their costumes back.

00:34.874 --> 00:37.080
We lame-os?

00:37.142 --> 00:38.925
I have a remedy
for our predicament.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.481
Into this costumery.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.135
Yeah?
Oh.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.906
Friends of Homer's?

00:58.007 --> 00:59.217
They're not my friends.

00:59.281 --> 01:00.990
We brought a bottle of booze.

01:01.113 --> 01:02.991
Boooooze!

01:03.113 --> 01:04.673
Come in! Come in!

01:11.159 --> 01:12.188
Mmm.

01:14.168 --> 01:15.447
Good!

01:15.516 --> 01:17.256
Beer good.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.433
You good.

01:28.604 --> 01:32.406
You said you were going out
to kill children tonight.

01:32.485 --> 01:33.485
We were,

01:33.541 --> 01:36.259
then we bumped into our old friend,
the-the-the--

01:36.308 --> 01:37.654
my man here!

01:37.718 --> 01:39.712
You'll be sucking
your own blood tonight.

01:39.788 --> 01:40.992
Let's get 'em, girls!

01:44.186 --> 01:45.149
Bad Wolf!

01:45.213 --> 01:46.208
Bad!

01:46.266 --> 01:47.727
Lighten up, ladies.

01:47.792 --> 01:50.001
It's not cheating
when you're wearing a costume!

01:50.086 --> 01:51.645
Not the face!

02:10.032 --> 02:12.692
It's time to announce my choice
to represent our class

02:12.809 --> 02:14.780
at the National Reading Roundup.

02:14.855 --> 02:16.710
<i>Here it comes.</i>

02:16.782 --> 02:19.519
My choice is....
Hubert Wong!

02:19.590 --> 02:20.615
Wha...?

02:20.727 --> 02:22.367
Hooray for Different-Face!

02:22.437 --> 02:24.386
Congratulations,
Hubert.

02:24.497 --> 02:26.556
Or should I congratulate
your tutor:

02:26.607 --> 02:28.874
Amelia,
at the Homework Factory!

02:28.951 --> 02:30.582
Your victory is tainted!

02:30.693 --> 02:32.831
Asterisk! Asterisk!
Lisa,

02:32.902 --> 02:34.112
don't take it personally.

02:34.177 --> 02:36.531
I barely spent any time
on this decision.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.189
Asterisk! Asterisk!

02:38.268 --> 02:39.287
Asterisk!

02:42.729 --> 02:44.574
Lisa Simpson
in detention?!

02:44.656 --> 02:47.332
My horoscope told me I'd see
something interesting today,

02:47.399 --> 02:49.278
but I thought that meant
the horoscope itself!

02:49.397 --> 02:51.515
Stupid Miss Hoover.

02:54.653 --> 02:56.093
I heard about your run-in
with Hoover.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.428
Aren't teachers
the worst?

02:57.466 --> 02:58.747
I don't want to
talk about it.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.737
Listen, you're
a smart kid.

03:00.799 --> 03:02.295
I bet you like ideas.

03:02.408 --> 03:03.429
I do.

03:03.523 --> 03:05.985
Well, I just had a whopper!

03:06.057 --> 03:08.608
What if you got revenge
on Krabappel for me,

03:08.685 --> 03:11.354
and I got revenge
on Hoover for you?

03:11.431 --> 03:12.573
Crisscross!

03:12.630 --> 03:13.600
Interesting.

03:13.656 --> 03:16.706
With no obvious motive,
no one would suspect us.

03:16.784 --> 03:18.470
Exactly! Crisscross!

03:18.528 --> 03:19.926
Do we have a deal?
Thanks,

03:20.021 --> 03:21.009
but I'll pass.

03:21.123 --> 03:22.373
If I say "crisscross"
one more time,

03:22.430 --> 03:23.515
will that change your mind?
Listen,

03:23.624 --> 03:24.976
you're a persistent
fellow, but I...

03:25.026 --> 03:26.169
Crisscross!
I'm in.

03:42.747 --> 03:44.757
Bart, have you established
your alibi?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.165
Yep. I'm at the tennis match.

03:46.234 --> 03:47.811
And people will remember
you were there?

03:47.881 --> 03:49.752
I'm pretty sure they will.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.154
Mm-hmm.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.947
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

03:59.220 --> 03:59.969
Hello?

04:00.034 --> 04:01.523
Hello? Oh!

04:01.584 --> 04:03.400
I've been ding-dong-ditched!

04:05.097 --> 04:05.984
Crisscross.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.836
You should've seen the look
on Krabappel's face!

04:12.896 --> 04:15.034
And you should've seen
the look on Hoover's face.

04:15.111 --> 04:16.059
In fact,

04:16.141 --> 04:16.930
here it is.

04:18.713 --> 04:20.100
You killed her?

04:20.156 --> 04:21.564
Right. Like we agreed.

04:21.635 --> 04:22.926
I never said "kill"!

04:22.981 --> 04:24.301
Yeah, 'cause you're smart.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.472
You don't say "kill,"
you say "prank."

04:26.523 --> 04:28.087
Like Mom and Dad
say "snuggle"

04:28.174 --> 04:29.182
when what they
really mean is

04:29.251 --> 04:30.914
"let's lock the
door and hug."

04:30.957 --> 04:33.377
Well, I didn't kill
Mrs. Krabappel!

04:33.490 --> 04:35.594
So, all you did was ring
her doorbell and run?

04:35.651 --> 04:37.604
Yeah, ding-dong-ditch!

04:37.673 --> 04:39.973
"Ding-dong-ditch"
means you kill her,

04:40.036 --> 04:42.191
then you throw that ding-dong
into a ditch.

04:42.252 --> 04:44.568
Geez, pick up a book.

04:44.636 --> 04:45.739
You're a monster!

04:45.815 --> 04:47.636
A deal's a deal,
little sister.

04:47.693 --> 04:50.166
Tomorrow after school,
go to her house and t.p. her.

04:50.211 --> 04:51.811
That's it?
Just t.p. her?

04:51.867 --> 04:53.474
Yeah, torture and pulverize her.

04:53.515 --> 04:55.461
Then ding-dong-ditch the body
and we're even.

04:55.547 --> 04:56.985
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

05:08.406 --> 05:09.666
Oh, Lisa!

05:09.727 --> 05:12.314
Come hold this blade so it
doesn't slice through my neck.

05:14.406 --> 05:15.617
Come on.

05:15.669 --> 05:16.944
I trust you completely.

05:24.228 --> 05:25.878
Slice her like a bagel!

05:25.939 --> 05:27.244
Ah, got it!

05:27.356 --> 05:28.146
Thanks, Lisa.

05:28.207 --> 05:29.753
Last thing I want is
to be sliced in two--

05:29.805 --> 05:31.261
you know, like a bagel.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.441
Bart?

05:41.507 --> 05:42.695
I've been waiting
for you...

05:43.408 --> 05:45.093
and trying to figure out
how girls pee.

05:47.770 --> 05:49.022
Sorry, Bart, I couldn't do it!

05:49.081 --> 05:50.405
There's got to be another way.

05:50.481 --> 05:52.476
What if I gave you
homework help?

05:52.549 --> 05:53.660
I won't give you
the answers,

05:53.717 --> 05:56.064
but I'll give you the tools
to find the answers yourself.

05:56.124 --> 05:57.354
No dice.

05:57.428 --> 05:58.893
Either take care of Krabappel,

05:58.924 --> 06:01.936
or Groundskeeper Willie will say
he saw you kill Miss Hoover.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.254
Why would Willie do that?

06:03.329 --> 06:04.490
Let's just say...

06:04.571 --> 06:06.096
he owes me a favor.

06:08.464 --> 06:09.490
Crisscross!

06:09.564 --> 06:11.338
Like the plaid
on me kilt!

06:11.395 --> 06:12.572
You're not wearing
a kilt.

06:12.645 --> 06:13.327
Uh-oh.

06:14.152 --> 06:14.932
All right, Bart.

06:15.003 --> 06:16.344
I guess I have
no choice.

06:16.445 --> 06:17.833
I have to kill...

06:18.397 --> 06:19.153
you!

07:09.882 --> 07:10.797
Go ahead, do it.

07:10.870 --> 07:11.984
You're no different from me.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.607
We're made from the same dinna.

07:13.636 --> 07:15.796
It's pronounced D-N-A,
you idiot.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.321
And we are not the same.

07:17.391 --> 07:19.805
I am not a murderer,
and I never will be!

07:25.402 --> 07:26.687
Well done, Lisa!

07:26.751 --> 07:28.786
It was an accident,
I swear!

07:28.859 --> 07:30.786
Sure. An accident.

07:30.898 --> 07:31.785
Ha!

07:31.876 --> 07:34.551
<i>Ay carumba, you
little snot.</i>

07:43.513 --> 07:44.865
I'm here at Krustyburger
for the launch

07:44.924 --> 07:46.864
of the highly anticipated
"Burger Squared."

07:46.940 --> 07:48.354
Krusty, what
can you tell us

07:48.401 --> 07:50.523
about this fantastic
new sandwich?

07:50.562 --> 07:52.250
I'm glad you
asked, Kent.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.076
We start

07:53.148 --> 07:55.593
with Grade A beef,
feed that to other cows,

07:55.652 --> 07:58.542
then kill them
and serve the unholy results

07:58.593 --> 08:00.324
on a seven-grain bun.

08:00.359 --> 08:01.902
Burger Squared!

08:03.120 --> 08:04.064
The math checks out!

08:04.120 --> 08:05.531
Cows eating cows?!

08:05.704 --> 08:07.259
That's an abomination!

08:07.310 --> 08:08.488
Now, Lisa,

08:08.559 --> 08:09.776
you're a vegetarian,

08:09.850 --> 08:12.051
but these cows have made
a different choice.

08:12.113 --> 08:14.829
And now, this lucky reporter
will be the first human

08:14.888 --> 08:18.088
to sample this delicious crime
against nature.

08:18.154 --> 08:19.381
Mmm.

08:19.451 --> 08:20.619
Juicy, flavorful,

08:20.669 --> 08:22.356
with just a hint of...

08:26.315 --> 08:26.928
Hey!

08:26.998 --> 08:28.641
That's my check-cashing
arm, you stupid...

08:43.724 --> 08:46.603
you might want
to wash me before you eat me.

08:46.663 --> 08:48.656
Thank you.

08:49.622 --> 08:51.178
The munchers got Moe!

08:51.269 --> 08:52.852
Well, we're not going
out to help him.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.974
We have no idea what hideous
creatures might be out there!

08:56.046 --> 08:57.799
Please, let me in!

08:58.933 --> 09:00.251
How do I know
you're not a muncher?

09:00.305 --> 09:02.984
I'm your father
and I need your help!

09:03.071 --> 09:05.313
I can't make sense
of that muncher talk!

09:10.260 --> 09:11.243
Hungry.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.815
So hungry.

09:12.872 --> 09:14.228
There's nothing to eat.

09:14.285 --> 09:16.221
Except this.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.101
There's gotta be something yummy
out there.

09:28.056 --> 09:29.665
A hamburger!

09:39.119 --> 09:41.038
Bart ate
a tainted burger!

09:41.130 --> 09:42.719
I'll bash him
with this book!

09:44.780 --> 09:45.485
Dad!

09:45.539 --> 09:47.350
No! That's the last book
in the world!

09:47.464 --> 09:48.598
Really?

09:48.682 --> 09:50.094
Yes! It's-- oh.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.252
Go ahead.

09:52.389 --> 09:53.308
Wait!

09:53.376 --> 09:55.111
The burger didn't change me!

09:55.232 --> 09:56.763
I'm not a muncher!

09:56.856 --> 09:58.257
Oh, my God.

09:58.309 --> 10:00.641
If Bart could eat the burger
and survive,

10:00.711 --> 10:04.625
then maybe he can yield the key
to an anti-muncher vaccine!

10:06.437 --> 10:08.827
Then we must keep this boy
safe from harm!

10:09.680 --> 10:10.697
Better call Dr. Hibbert.

10:14.434 --> 10:16.587
Well, I suppose
Bart could be immune--

10:16.669 --> 10:18.639
a genetic "chosen one,"
if you will.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.374
If so, secrets locked

10:21.473 --> 10:24.168
within his blood could
be the key to saving humanity.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.777
You must get him immediately

10:25.870 --> 10:27.602
to the safe zone,
just outside of town.

10:27.638 --> 10:30.698
If you see my wife,
tell her I love her.

10:30.784 --> 10:32.589
You mean tell her
I love her?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.834
Or I meaning you?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.649
Mm, I'll just
high-five her.

10:43.263 --> 10:46.049
Now remember, no loud noises.

10:48.754 --> 10:51.238
Oh, man, that
breeze feels good!

10:56.499 --> 10:57.797
To the panic room!

10:57.902 --> 10:59.370
We don't have
a panic room!

10:59.461 --> 11:00.949
To the panic room store!

11:07.564 --> 11:09.764
Come with me
if you want to live.

11:11.907 --> 11:15.155
Another politician
who can't keep his promises.

11:15.473 --> 11:16.325
Psst!

11:16.428 --> 11:17.223
This way.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.320
Well, this day can't
get any crazier.

11:33.699 --> 11:35.982
Apu, how did you survive?

11:36.089 --> 11:37.492
Well, as a vegetarian,

11:37.570 --> 11:39.745
I did not consume
any tainted burgers,

11:39.814 --> 11:42.757
and as a convenience store
owner, I am armed to the teeth.

11:46.156 --> 11:48.292
We need windows, too!

11:54.800 --> 11:55.848
Shoot her!

11:58.419 --> 11:59.713
I can't shoot her.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.153
She's Lisa's godmother.

12:01.228 --> 12:02.617
You can apologize in hell!

12:02.655 --> 12:03.738
I guess I could.

12:17.893 --> 12:19.310
Hmm?

12:19.366 --> 12:20.278
What the...?

12:21.072 --> 12:22.098
I will get
out and push.

12:22.162 --> 12:25.235
No matter what, Bart must
make it to the safe zone.

12:32.883 --> 12:35.970
That was so noble of Apu
to give his life for us.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.207
Where are you going?!

12:37.266 --> 12:39.579
You were supposed to stop
at the bottom and wait for me!

12:54.075 --> 12:55.633
I don't see the
safe zone anywhere.

12:55.723 --> 12:56.918
Let's play a game.

12:57.029 --> 12:59.110
Who gets to carry
the chosen one?

12:59.981 --> 13:00.703
Ow!

13:00.782 --> 13:04.542
Aw, did the chosen one hurt
his chosen little noggin?

13:04.613 --> 13:06.987
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

13:07.097 --> 13:09.363
Ow! Quit it. Ow!

13:09.451 --> 13:10.434
Quit it!

13:11.304 --> 13:12.302
Well, well, well.

13:12.366 --> 13:15.513
Who's an unproductive
worker now?

13:16.349 --> 13:17.750
Got your nose.

13:19.907 --> 13:20.577
Why you...

13:29.038 --> 13:30.605
Homie, where
have you been?

13:32.731 --> 13:35.105
Dad, are you becoming a muncher?

13:35.183 --> 13:38.645
I think the better brains is,
are you brains a brains?

13:40.657 --> 13:42.063
Where do you want it,
the mouth or the eyes?

13:42.151 --> 13:43.802
Ooh, mouth.
Eyes it is.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.180
No! When we get you
to the safe zone,

13:46.272 --> 13:47.923
we can cure your father!

13:48.006 --> 13:49.125
Safe zone?

13:49.239 --> 13:51.038
You really think
there's a safe zone?

13:52.932 --> 13:53.914
Well, you're right.
It's right over there.

13:56.227 --> 13:57.192
Let us in.

13:57.366 --> 14:00.072
We have the chosen one!

14:00.124 --> 14:02.580
Oh...!

14:02.649 --> 14:03.537
Welcome, son.

14:03.587 --> 14:06.586
To survive, all we must
do is eat your flesh.

14:06.684 --> 14:08.278
Hold it right there, bub.

14:08.351 --> 14:11.203
What kind of civilized people
eat the body

14:11.274 --> 14:13.532
and blood of their savior?

14:15.491 --> 14:16.852
There must be another way.

14:18.494 --> 14:20.141
Hmm...

14:22.142 --> 14:23.354
<i>Time has passed.</i>

14:23.430 --> 14:25.108
<i>Children play in the streets.</i>

14:25.185 --> 14:27.613
<i>At night,
there is music and laughter.</i>

14:27.681 --> 14:31.140
<i>And all we had to do was let
Bart take a bath in our food.</i>

14:31.202 --> 14:33.275
Hey, Lis,
want some soup?

14:38.433 --> 14:39.426
Mm-hmm.

14:49.191 --> 14:54.013
* Oh, why can't no girl love
a guy with this mug *

14:54.769 --> 14:59.172
* Whose mother declared
you're too ugly to hug? *

15:06.129 --> 15:08.287
How's about pouring
me a beer, ugly?

15:08.345 --> 15:10.376
How about some
of my new microbrew?

15:11.235 --> 15:12.925
Must be another mouse
in the pipe.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.919
Let's see
if this cobra solves it.

15:18.039 --> 15:19.206
Nothing.

15:19.281 --> 15:20.125
Huh.

15:20.232 --> 15:25.317
* Just once I wish cupid
would draw back his bow *

15:25.450 --> 15:29.989
* And shoot me a cutie
whose standards are low... *

15:31.410 --> 15:32.726
An unattended tap!

15:32.787 --> 15:34.480
Like taking beer
from a baby!

15:34.577 --> 15:39.022
* I'm unlucky in love,
I'm unlucky in luck... *

15:41.934 --> 15:42.808
Oh, my God, Homer!

15:42.929 --> 15:43.693
Just try to relax.

15:44.462 --> 15:46.084
Okay, don't relax!
Don't relax!

15:46.937 --> 15:48.861
Oh, Marge, the most
awful thing just happened!

15:48.923 --> 15:50.133
What is it, Moe?

15:50.197 --> 15:51.507
Um...

15:53.005 --> 15:55.983
She's so beautiful,
it makes my heart take wing!

15:56.059 --> 15:57.151
Look at me!

15:57.228 --> 15:59.575
I can fl... Ow! Ow! Aah!

16:05.482 --> 16:07.975
Um, Marge, Homer,
uh, just ran out

16:08.038 --> 16:10.265
saying he don't love you,
and he never did.

16:10.362 --> 16:11.336
He what?!

16:11.456 --> 16:13.987
Help me!

16:14.041 --> 16:15.246
That, uh... that's me.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.176
I've been taking
ventriloquism lessons.

16:18.683 --> 16:20.405
Help me or kill me!

16:20.510 --> 16:21.798
Huh? Huh!

16:21.869 --> 16:24.959
Now, let Dr. Moe cure
what ails you.

16:36.738 --> 16:38.811
There's something odd
about this beer.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.171
* It tastes
like cuddling *

16:42.226 --> 16:44.270
* It tastes like clean clothes *

16:44.339 --> 16:49.426
* It tastes like hot steaming
cocoa mixed with rainbows... *

16:49.508 --> 16:51.075
It does?
* Full-bodied *

16:51.133 --> 16:52.533
* Full-blooded *

16:52.615 --> 16:54.916
* It's such a lovely blend *

16:54.973 --> 16:59.967
* It's jolly, it's loyal, like
drinking your best friend! *

17:00.790 --> 17:02.418
* I stopped my crying *

17:03.247 --> 17:05.205
* Why, I don't know *

17:05.897 --> 17:11.377
* But this rosy, cozy,
bubbles-in-my-nose-y *

17:11.449 --> 17:16.762
* Makes me wanna have... Mo'! *

17:21.858 --> 17:24.683
This is the best
musical in light years.

17:24.776 --> 17:27.711
Light years measure
distance, not time.

17:27.779 --> 17:29.276
You know
what I meant.

17:33.655 --> 17:37.817
So, Marge, uh, Homer's been gone
a whole week, huh?

17:47.492 --> 17:49.323
Marge, I've got some
bad news to give you.

17:49.389 --> 17:51.520
It's a letter from Homer
on my stationery

17:51.606 --> 17:53.030
in my handwriting,

17:53.109 --> 17:55.117
using my idioms
and speech patterns.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.017
And it begins, "Dear Midge:

17:57.068 --> 17:58.662
"you probably hate me by now,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.699
"and if you don't,
what's wrong which youse?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.044
"But don't give up on men.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.368
Bart, Linda and the other one
there need a dad."

18:05.211 --> 18:06.846
That does sound like Homer.

18:06.906 --> 18:08.530
"The reason
I left you is simple."

18:09.299 --> 18:10.745
"I'm gay."?!

18:10.873 --> 18:12.273
Yeah, read on. It gets gayer.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.675
* While turning gay
the other day *

18:14.783 --> 18:16.891
* A thought occurred to me *

18:17.649 --> 18:22.791
* I'd like to try most every guy
from here to Timbuk-tee *

18:24.341 --> 18:26.651
* Oh, there's so many men
around the world *

18:26.956 --> 18:28.095
* Of every shape and size *

18:28.158 --> 18:31.804
* I want to nibble on Jamaican
jerks and teriyaki thighs *

18:31.876 --> 18:33.854
* I want
to French-kiss a Frenchman *

18:33.919 --> 18:35.684
* And spoon an English duke *

18:35.754 --> 18:36.954
* 'Cause frankly, dear *

18:36.996 --> 18:39.150
* To not be queer
just makes me want to puke *

18:39.882 --> 18:43.033
* So find yourself a man
who'll want you in the sack *

18:43.097 --> 18:45.119
* I recommend
our dear old friend *

18:46.176 --> 18:50.018
* Bartender Moe Szyslak! *

18:51.904 --> 18:54.986
* Letters don't lie! *

18:55.778 --> 18:57.007
So, what do think, Marge?

18:57.070 --> 18:58.562
Will you give Moe a throw?

18:58.626 --> 19:00.295
Hmm, well...

19:00.397 --> 19:02.790
Maybe you need a little more
milk of amnesia.

19:03.649 --> 19:05.436
Dang, I'm missing
the secret ingredient.

19:05.490 --> 19:08.800
Uh, let me squeeze some more out
of the secret ingredient bag.

19:08.889 --> 19:10.792
Uh-oh.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.512
Looks like I got to wing it
a little bit here.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.279
The other day,
I ran into an Irishman.

19:15.336 --> 19:16.438
Oh, really?

19:16.524 --> 19:17.596
No, O'Reilly.

19:19.135 --> 19:20.755
Oh, uh, I see we're,
uh, back in business.

19:20.899 --> 19:24.736
Now, a little more hemoglobin,
and your wife will be disrobin'.

19:28.415 --> 19:29.722
I can't talk now.

19:29.797 --> 19:30.870
I'm watching a play.

19:31.610 --> 19:33.939
You want how much
for a radiator?

19:34.019 --> 19:35.733
Is that new or rebuilt?

19:37.900 --> 19:38.876
There.

19:41.588 --> 19:44.562
Oh. Oh. Oh, my God,
I've never felt so...

19:44.674 --> 19:47.438
uncreeped-out by you!

19:47.548 --> 19:49.001
Marge, I loves youse.

19:49.083 --> 19:50.453
Will youse be mines?

19:50.567 --> 19:53.097
I guess it is time to move on.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.493
Before you do, I just
got to warn you, Marge.

20:01.581 --> 20:04.468
* My taste for romance
is kinda perverse *

20:04.558 --> 20:07.913
* I can only make love
in the back of a hearse *

20:08.026 --> 20:11.113
* Plus I gotta be dressed
as a Civil War nurse *

20:11.203 --> 20:14.157
* And then when I'm finished,
I'll go through your purse *

20:14.249 --> 20:15.675
* But you could do worse *

20:15.759 --> 20:17.398
* I could do worse *

20:18.502 --> 20:19.781
* We're proof that you *

20:19.871 --> 20:22.146
- * You could do worse *
- * I could do worse *

20:22.226 --> 20:25.940
* She couldn't possibly
do worse! *

20:30.474 --> 20:34.282
Homer, does this mean
you still love me?

20:34.405 --> 20:35.811
Of course I do, Marge.

20:35.905 --> 20:39.043
Can you still love a man
who's half-beer?

20:39.133 --> 20:40.971
I always have.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.550
To love!

20:48.977 --> 20:52.755
<i>* We hope you enjoyed
this year's Halloween show *</i>

20:53.505 --> 20:55.822
* Treehouse of Horror,
number XX! *

20:57.026 --> 20:57.716
Shh!
