WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:10.761
Ba-bum.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.222
[croaks]

00:14.598 --> 00:15.891
[panting]

00:17.017 --> 00:20.229
[Claudia]<i> Previously on</i>
The Dragon Prince...

00:20.312 --> 00:23.106
[Viren] <i>A party of our best </i>
<i>will be dispatched immediately </i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.650
<i>to find the princes.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.444
<i>I will task my own children, </i>
<i>Soren and Claudia,</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.863
<i>with leading the rescue expedition.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:33.367
I bound myself to end Prince Ezran's life.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.953
And this binding will never come off
while he's alive.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.331
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.041
-Just take it!
-[groans]

00:42.292 --> 00:43.627
[Ezran] We have to do something!

00:43.710 --> 00:44.586
[Callum] Ez, no!

00:46.463 --> 00:47.673
He's alive!

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
Oh, no.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.812
Something's wrong with the egg.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
[theme music playing]

01:20.330 --> 01:21.790
[roaring]

01:53.739 --> 01:54.990
Ez, you should really try to sleep.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.868
I'm... I'm...

01:58.869 --> 02:01.496
[sneezes] I'm fide.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.791
You're not "fide," you need rest.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.962
[sniffles] What are you drawing?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.006
Oh.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.760
When you were down there, under the ice,
I was so scared.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.971
I thought I was going to lose you
like we lost her.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.223
But somehow you made it.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.808
And now I can't stop thinking...

02:22.726 --> 02:24.561
maybe she was watching over us.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.025
If she knew what we were trying to do,
she'd be proud of us.

02:30.984 --> 02:35.739
And she would yell at you to go
sit closer to the fire and bundle up!

02:35.822 --> 02:37.991
[sniffles] I know.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.162
[Rayla] She's beautiful.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.580
She's your mother?

02:45.040 --> 02:45.874
[Callum] Yeah.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.419
Um, I found some moonberries.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.465
This should keep us full... for a day.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.094
And I found these for you.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.428
Bogeyberries!

02:58.512 --> 03:01.264
Ancient Xadian cure
for the common sniffles.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.683
Mmm... nope.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.811
They don't go in your mouth.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.813
Uh...

03:07.896 --> 03:11.858
To cure a stuffy nose,
you've got to stuff 'em up your nose.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.027
[Ezran] Oh. Seems doable.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.363
How's the egg doing?

03:17.489 --> 03:18.949
[Callum] I don't think
it's getting better.

03:19.032 --> 03:23.703
It was glowing so bright before,
but now it's dim and flickery.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.997
It's even darker than when I left.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.208
We gotta find help.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.504
[dogs barking]

03:54.776 --> 03:56.278
[Soren whistling]

03:57.654 --> 03:59.698
These are the best tracking hounds
in Katolis.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.243
One sniff, and they can follow
someone's scent for miles.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.578
[barking]

04:05.328 --> 04:06.997
The step-prince's training shirt.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.666
-It's so dirty.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.169
He spends most of his training
falling in the mud.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.963
More like the "mis-step" prince!
[laughing]

04:15.046 --> 04:16.465
Uh...

04:17.966 --> 04:20.886
You know, 'cause he trips and falls a lot?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.096
-[dog whimpers]
-Oh, no, the joke was clear.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.973
[sniffing]

04:26.683 --> 04:28.226
-[barking]
-They found the trail!

04:29.436 --> 04:32.105
-[horse whinnies]
-Yah!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.988
[sighs] And... they lost the trail.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.784
[dog whimpers]

04:46.453 --> 04:48.455
Aw, good try, doggies.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.756
[Rayla] There it is! A town!

05:01.259 --> 05:04.513
I knew I saw smoke.
Maybe we can find help.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.475
Okay, sure.
We might find a dragon egg expert.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.561
But we will definitely find
a bunch of elf-hating humans.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.146
[scoffs] No problem.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.611
Get ready to meet... human Rayla!

05:20.487 --> 05:22.322
Yeah, I'm not sure that's gonna cut it.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.032
Just wait.

05:24.115 --> 05:28.328
Once I pair my disguise
with my perfect human impression,

05:28.411 --> 05:30.038
the illusion will be complete.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.626
[with accent] Greetings, fellow humans!
Human fellows!

05:35.210 --> 05:37.921
I sure do like hanging out with
other humans,

05:38.004 --> 05:41.383
and talking about things like money...
and starting wars.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.261
That's pretty good, actually.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.931
Totally, my good human friend!
Bring it in.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.516
High four!

05:50.600 --> 05:53.103
Uh... can you impersonate a fifth finger?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.021
Right, right.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.525
I need some kind of a... hand disguise.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.778
Look, snow-elf!

06:01.861 --> 06:04.447
I'm pretty sure that's a snow-man.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.955
Hand disguise!

06:16.126 --> 06:18.128
Just don't shake hands with anyone.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.925
Snow-elf.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.981
[with accent] Just walking into town,
without a care in the world,

06:38.064 --> 06:40.567
despite my sub-century life expectancy.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.861
-Shh!
-That's the spirit!

06:45.739 --> 06:50.243
I defended the border against all manners
of horrors and monstrosities.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.413
Things you can't even imagine.
There's nothing I fear now.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.918
In fact, I wager I could defeat
any challenger here,

06:59.002 --> 07:01.087
with nothing but my dagger!

07:01.171 --> 07:03.048
[crowd gasps]

07:07.385 --> 07:08.595
What about you?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.388
[clears throat]

07:11.222 --> 07:12.432
[crowd applauds]

07:13.934 --> 07:16.603
Maybe... you!

07:20.273 --> 07:22.192
-[crowd gasps]
-[big guy chuckling]

07:24.027 --> 07:27.030
This isn't even my biggest sword.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.990
Ooh! I'll take that bet!

07:29.074 --> 07:32.118
-[man 1] My money on the big guy!
-[man 2] Mine, too!

07:36.706 --> 07:38.792
They're distracted. Let's go.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.252
Wait, you'll want to see this.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.342
[crowd exclaims]

07:54.474 --> 07:58.144
Well... I certainly hope
that wasn't your biggest sword.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.355
[crowd laughing]

08:02.524 --> 08:04.067
[big guy sobbing]

08:05.110 --> 08:07.696
Ha! Anyone else?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.864
What was that?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.825
It's a Sunforge blade!

08:11.908 --> 08:15.662
Wow! I can't believe
I just saw a real Sunforge blade!

08:15.745 --> 08:17.122
What's a Sunforge blade?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.208
In Xadia,
Sunfire elves can make magic weapons

08:20.291 --> 08:23.837
that stay as hot as the moment
they're forged for hundreds of years.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.088
See that?

08:25.171 --> 08:28.800
The sheath is inscribed with special runes
to protect him from the heat.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.928
-Otherwise, well...
-His pants would be on fire?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.597
Yeah. His legs, too.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.894
Rayla, if that blade can cut through
a steel sword like it was butter...

08:40.437 --> 08:42.939
would you say it can cut through
pretty much anything?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.860
Not just pretty much,
it can cut through anything.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.279
[gasps] My wrist binding!

08:50.363 --> 08:52.198
You have to go get that dagger.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.785
But what about the egg?

08:55.869 --> 08:59.039
We'll find help for the egg.
Just meet back here at the statue.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.373
How will you get that dagger?

09:00.457 --> 09:03.209
I'm going to ask nicely.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.466
[Soren] What are we gonna do?

09:09.549 --> 09:14.054
Can you just be quiet for a minute?
I'm trying to think.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.889
Every minute we sit here,

09:15.972 --> 09:19.726
the step-prince and the crown runt
get further and further away.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.062
[sighs] I know a tracking spell,

09:22.145 --> 09:23.813
but first I need
something from the princes.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.732
We have this?

09:25.815 --> 09:28.777
No, something more personal than a shirt.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.571
You mean like... underwear?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.490
No, gross!

09:34.157 --> 09:36.785
I mean like spit or toenails.

09:36.868 --> 09:41.331
We don't have time to search
the whole lodge for toenails, Claudia!

09:41.414 --> 09:43.416
Well, I don't see you doing
anything helpful!

09:43.500 --> 09:44.918
We have to do this!

09:45.001 --> 09:47.629
If I fail, I don't know what Dad
will do to me!

09:47.712 --> 09:50.048
And I'm already failing at step one,
never mind...

09:50.131 --> 09:52.133
"Never mind" what?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.266
You said,
"something like spit or toenails."

10:03.353 --> 10:04.979
What about elf hair?

10:05.563 --> 10:08.608
Yes! That's perfect!

10:08.691 --> 10:10.527
We'll find Callum and Ezran

10:10.610 --> 10:14.447
wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.950
Cute braid, though!

10:22.205 --> 10:26.084
Look! Do you think
this is some kind of animal doctor?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.293
I think so.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.921
Or... a dating service for pets?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.549
Probably an animal doctor.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.883
But that's a good idea!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.093
Right, Bait?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.761
[sighs heavily]

10:41.141 --> 10:42.183
[doctor] I'll be right with you!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.606
[whinnying]

10:54.320 --> 10:55.405
[grunts]

10:56.114 --> 10:57.657
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.827
There's nothing I can do
for that poor creature.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.328
-Mmm.
-What?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.582
Oh, no, no, no. He's fine.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.835
-We have, uh, a different problem.
-[horse whinnies]

11:10.336 --> 11:13.423
Oh, what happened to you, little sweetie?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.675
-[whinnies]
-Aww!

11:15.758 --> 11:18.177
You saw something really scary,
didn't you?

11:18.261 --> 11:19.512
[doctor] She sure did.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.432
This one ran away up the Cursed Caldera.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.268
Whatever she saw,
she's lucky it only scared her.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.604
Won't make that mistake again!

11:28.271 --> 11:30.148
So... what can I help you with?

11:34.652 --> 11:35.862
[coins clinking]

11:50.001 --> 11:50.960
[gasps]

11:56.883 --> 11:58.801
[panting]

12:08.478 --> 12:10.605
I won that money fair and square!

12:10.688 --> 12:13.566
-I don't want your money.
-Then what do you want from me?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.735
I want your help.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.534
[horse grunting]

12:24.327 --> 12:27.080
Tell me exactly what's going on.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.917
[Callum] Well, uh...

12:31.459 --> 12:34.420
-A friend of ours has a problem.
-Jofus.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.047
Your friend's name is Jofus?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.591
-It's a real name.
-Mmm-hmm. Yep.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.512
Real name. Our friend, Jofus, has an egg.

12:42.595 --> 12:47.016
[stammers] An animal egg.
He's been taking really good care of it.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.603
You know, keeping it warm, and safe...
wrapped in blankets.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.189
Except one time he dropped it
into an icy lake for several minutes.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.691
[clears throat] Anywho...

12:54.774 --> 12:56.109
Uh, sorry, what was that?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.986
He dropped it into an icy lake.

12:58.069 --> 13:02.657
Joseph. Uh, Jofus.
Jofus did. This was Jofus.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.661
Right, of course. That sounds bad.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.122
Yeah. We're worried it's hurt.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.625
The egg is colder,
and it doesn't glow like it used to.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.503
Wait, a glowing egg?

13:16.295 --> 13:18.172
Uh... yes?

13:19.841 --> 13:22.468
Look, I can tell you have a real problem.

13:22.552 --> 13:27.306
I want to help, but I won't be able to
unless you tell me what's really going on.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.186
I promise you,
I'm not going to get you in trouble.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.150
-You can't tell anyone.
-I won't, okay?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.235
But you need to trust me.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.071
[sighs]

13:48.161 --> 13:49.287
[gasps]

13:53.082 --> 13:54.083
[Rayla] Wait!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.585
I don't want to fight you.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.046
I just want to borrow your blade
to cut this.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.673
Oh, you just want to "borrow" it.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.426
-Do you know how valuable---
-Fine. You hold it.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.927
Just cut this thing off me.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.096
But it'll burn you.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.766
I don't care! Just do it, please.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.945
[yelps]

14:27.950 --> 14:30.453
[gasps] You're one of them!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.122
[with accent] Who, me?

14:33.206 --> 14:37.293
I'm just a simple human girl,
who likes the human things,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.921
like bread, and complaining all the time.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.799
No! You're an elf!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.509
[normal voice] Fine. I'm an elf.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.142
Calm down, this will only take a second.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.026
Ahh!

15:05.571 --> 15:09.992
No! Nothing can cut this stupid binding!
Ugh!

15:11.077 --> 15:13.996
Just take the dagger!
Don't hurt me, please!

15:15.331 --> 15:17.250
I'm not going to hurt you.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.585
And I'm not going to steal from you,
either.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.098
[Soren] So... what are we doing here?

15:32.181 --> 15:34.934
I just need one more thing
for the tracking spell.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.229
[Soren] Hmm. Special rocks? Magic twig?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.862
Ah, here it is!

15:48.030 --> 15:49.198
This way!

15:53.369 --> 15:55.037
You're kidding, right?

15:56.038 --> 16:00.418
[grunting] If only... I weren't...

16:00.501 --> 16:01.961
so muscular.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.176
That's a dragon egg, isn't it?

16:09.552 --> 16:13.306
I've never seen one before.
Only pictures in books.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.141
I'll do what I can.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.144
Hmm.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.566
-I do hear a heartbeat.
-That's good, right?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.610
It's faint, and slow.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.031
I'm afraid it's dying.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.077
I don't know what I can do to save it.
I'm so sorry.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.039
No! There has to be something you can do!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.957
Anything! Please...

16:42.168 --> 16:45.505
Come on, Ez, let's go.
We'll find another way.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.427
[doctor] Wait.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.681
I'm hesitant to tell you about this,
because it might be incredibly dangerous.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.101
There was a miracle
that happened a few years ago,

16:59.185 --> 17:02.438
but it happened... on the Cursed Caldera.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.775
There's someone you should meet.

17:09.695 --> 17:14.200
I'm Ellis.
And this is my sweetie wolf, Ava!

17:14.283 --> 17:15.576
-[Ava coos]
-[Ellis exclaims]

17:15.660 --> 17:19.956
[Ellis chuckles] The doctor's right,
there was a miracle.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.625
I still don't really understand
how it happened.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.128
But I do know this...
without it, Ava would be dead.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.925
[howling]

17:31.008 --> 17:33.094
[Ellis] <i>Two years ago, </i>
<i>I found her in the woods, </i>

17:33.177 --> 17:35.471
<i>when she was just a little cub.</i>

17:37.056 --> 17:39.642
<i>Somehow, she got herself caught</i>
<i>in a hunter's trap.</i>

17:39.725 --> 17:43.312
<i>Her front paw was crushed </i>
<i>in the rusty metal jaws.</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:44.647
<i>And she was scared.</i>

17:45.606 --> 17:47.358
<i>But she still had fight in her!</i>

17:47.441 --> 17:48.693
[Ava whimpers]

17:50.152 --> 17:54.282
I know you're hurting.
It's okay! I want to help you!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.325
[yips]

17:56.409 --> 17:58.911
<i>I got her free, </i>
<i>and took her back to the village. </i>

18:01.998 --> 18:03.291
<i>But things got worse.</i>

18:06.377 --> 18:07.503
[whimpers]

18:08.921 --> 18:12.925
[softly] Her leg is too badly hurt.
It'll have to be removed.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.022
[barking]

18:31.193 --> 18:33.696
[man] We have
too many mouths to feed already.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.864
[Ellis] Please!

18:34.947 --> 18:38.367
Just for a few weeks,
while she gets stronger!

18:38.451 --> 18:40.828
Then we can send her back to the forest.

18:40.911 --> 18:44.373
The pack won't accept her like this.
They'll let her die.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.337
[sighs] Ellis...

18:50.212 --> 18:51.797
I know it's hard to accept,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.967
but putting her down now
is an act of kindness.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.345
Otherwise, she'll only suffer.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.846
[barks]

19:00.473 --> 19:01.891
[sobbing] No!

19:05.561 --> 19:07.980
[Ellis] <i>I took her </i>
<i>where no one would follow us.</i>

19:08.064 --> 19:10.775
<i>Up the slope of the Cursed Caldera.</i>

19:14.028 --> 19:15.780
<i>It was like the legends said.</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:17.948
<i>The higher we climbed...</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:22.078
<i>the more terrifying creatures </i>
<i>lurked in the shadows. </i>

19:23.579 --> 19:25.081
<i>But we kept going. </i>

19:34.340 --> 19:36.592
I won't ever leave you.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.095
We're gonna make it through this!
[sniffles]

19:39.178 --> 19:40.304
[crying]

19:40.388 --> 19:42.556
[Ellis] <i>I was trying to make </i>
<i>Ava feel better,</i>

19:43.099 --> 19:46.519
<i>but inside, I knew all was lost.</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:48.813
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

19:53.150 --> 19:55.486
[woman] Oh, what a beautiful creature!

19:56.862 --> 19:59.490
[voice breaking] No... she's hurt.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.119
[woman] She's perfect.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.509
[barking]

20:28.477 --> 20:30.521
[pants and barks]

20:31.981 --> 20:34.233
We have to find this miracle healer.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.152
If she can save a cub's missing paw...

20:36.235 --> 20:37.778
Maybe she can save a dragon egg!

20:37.862 --> 20:39.488
Wait, a what?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.908
Uh, he said, maybe she can...

20:43.409 --> 20:45.035
shave a wagon leg!

20:45.119 --> 20:48.164
-But why would she... But--
-[Ezran] Sorry! Gotta go!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.623
[Callum] Thank you so much!

20:59.341 --> 21:01.260
[Soren] This is why I hate magic.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.971
It always involves something
really creepy.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.432
-[fungus squishing]
-Ugh! Gross!

21:18.194 --> 21:19.612
Oh, where is it?

21:19.695 --> 21:21.530
[gasps] Wait! I know how to find it.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.118
[Soren] What are you doing?
I can't see a thing!

21:26.202 --> 21:29.747
-[Claudia] Shh!
-Oh, can you see better if I'm quiet?

21:29.830 --> 21:33.793
[Claudia] Give it a moment.
Let your eyes adjust.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.926
[Claudia] Look! There!

21:47.306 --> 21:48.349
[Soren grunts]

21:56.273 --> 21:58.901
Still think magic is creepy and gross?

22:08.577 --> 22:11.413
All right, so what else
do we need for this spell?

22:11.497 --> 22:13.582
[chuckles] Nothing! We're all set.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.167
Really? Great!

22:15.251 --> 22:18.879
All we have to do now is climb to the top
of the tallest mountain in Katolis.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.590
It's a fun spell.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.180
[Ezran] Did you find the knife guy?
Did you get his knife?

22:30.182 --> 22:33.269
The bad news is that
the Sunforge blade didn't work.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.939
The good news is that the binding
will fall off naturally...

22:37.690 --> 22:39.108
when my hand does.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.694
[wincing] Ah, Rayla, I'm sorry.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.362
It's fine.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.781
Tell me something good happened
with the egg.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.907
Yes and no.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.867
[stammers] Well... Well, no.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.370
Not yet, but maybe!

22:51.453 --> 22:54.039
[chuckles nervously] So, yes? In a way?

22:54.665 --> 22:57.835
Okay, that's averaging out
to be around a maybe-minus.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.795
Yeah, that's about right.

22:59.878 --> 23:04.174
We learned about a miracle healer.
Someone who might be able to help the egg.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.759
And maybe your hand, too!

23:05.843 --> 23:07.136
Really?

23:07.219 --> 23:10.681
The only catch is,
the healer lives up there...

23:10.764 --> 23:12.266
the Cursed Caldera.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.561
Please tell me it's named that

23:15.644 --> 23:18.897
because it was discovered by
the great explorer, Sir Phineas Cursed.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.067
Well, actually, it's because it's infested
with horrible monsters--

23:22.151 --> 23:23.569
Yeah, no, I know.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.322
There she is! She's an elf!

23:26.405 --> 23:27.448
[mob clamoring]

23:27.531 --> 23:29.742
Oh, right.
I forgot about the other bad news.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.422
[laughs menacingly]

23:55.184 --> 23:56.602
[mob clamoring]

23:58.187 --> 24:01.023
Forget it.
No point following them up there.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.318
They'll never make it out alive.
