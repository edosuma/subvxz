WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:05.179
Hey, can you help me
put some of the food out?

00:05.180 --> 00:07.046
Yeah. Let me finish
packing this stuff up.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.315
You know how Sheldon is
if he sees Christmas stuff

00:09.317 --> 00:10.917
lying around after New Year's.

00:10.919 --> 00:13.319
Yeah, but he doesn't
live here anymore.

00:13.321 --> 00:15.054
Well, he doesn't live at
Walmart, but he still threw

00:15.056 --> 00:19.292
a tantrum when he saw
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

00:19.294 --> 00:20.960
And that's the same man
who complains

00:20.962 --> 00:24.397
you can't find Marshmallow Peeps
after Easter.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.234
Oh. It's Bernadette.
She says they're running late.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.669
"The baby threw up on Howard,

00:29.671 --> 00:32.604
and then Howard threw up
on Howard."

00:32.607 --> 00:35.741
Well, he didn't throw up
on the baby. That's a win.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.678
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.079
Hi! Welcome back. How was Texas?

00:40.081 --> 00:42.782
Oh, you know. The
Lone Star state. Hmm.

00:42.784 --> 00:44.517
That should be its Yelp rating.

00:44.519 --> 00:47.687
It was not a great trip.

00:47.689 --> 00:48.788
Well, you're home now.

00:48.790 --> 00:50.156
Yeah. It is good to be home.

00:50.158 --> 00:53.226
I... Oh, good Lord!
Is that mistletoe?

00:53.228 --> 00:55.995
Don't you maniacs
own a calendar?

00:55.997 --> 00:59.198
I told him to take it down.
He would not listen to me.

01:29.565 --> 01:31.799
Did you at least have
a good flight down there?

01:31.801 --> 01:33.100
It was fine.

01:33.102 --> 01:35.302
Other than the weird-tasting
juice Amy gave me.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.005
I slept the whole way.

01:38.007 --> 01:41.142
So, what happened in Texas
that was so bad?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.576
And before our next
drive to Comic-Con,

01:42.578 --> 01:44.712
I need the name of that juice.

01:44.714 --> 01:48.482
Well, we were on our way
to my mother's house...

01:50.653 --> 01:54.288
How did we get in the car?

01:54.290 --> 01:56.057
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:56.826 --> 01:58.526
How <i>did</i> you get him
in the car?

01:58.528 --> 02:00.161
I rented one of those carts,

02:00.163 --> 02:02.430
pushed him toward the open
door and just let inertia

02:02.432 --> 02:04.965
take care of the rest.

02:07.770 --> 02:09.603
So, while we're at
your mother's house,

02:09.604 --> 02:13.407
it might be a good time to tell
her that we're living together.

02:13.409 --> 02:14.942
Do we have to?

02:14.944 --> 02:18.179
I really don't want
to hear the religious lecture.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.347
Maybe there won't be one.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.683
There's always one.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.286
She gave it to my sister
about her boyfriend,

02:25.288 --> 02:27.188
my brother about his girlfriend,

02:27.190 --> 02:29.356
my father about his girlfriend.

02:30.359 --> 02:34.095
That one had some
un-Christian words in it.

02:34.097 --> 02:36.530
Well, she likes me.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.033
You know, there's a chance
she might be okay with it.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.068
Eh, I don't know.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.170
I am her precious little boy.

02:43.172 --> 02:46.874
And you <i>did</i> take my flower.

02:48.845 --> 02:51.746
Do boys have flowers?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.617
Who knows what he has
down there.

02:55.641 --> 02:56.752
Mm.

02:56.753 --> 02:58.252
Anyway...

02:58.254 --> 03:00.788
Thank you, God, for the food
we are about to receive

03:00.790 --> 03:02.857
and for the nourishment
of our bodies

03:02.859 --> 03:04.892
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.927
Amen.

03:06.929 --> 03:09.530
Given that your
hands prepared it,

03:09.532 --> 03:11.766
isn't that a little
self-serving?

03:11.768 --> 03:14.401
You start changing
the words to the prayers,

03:14.403 --> 03:18.572
next thing you know, you're
in a church with a guitar.

03:19.542 --> 03:22.910
Thank you for cooking,
it looks delicious.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.678
Oh, it's my pleasure. Mm.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.313
I'm so glad y'all could make it.

03:26.315 --> 03:27.748
So, tell me,
what's going on back home?

03:27.750 --> 03:31.318
Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette
had their baby.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.521
Oh, that's wonderful!

03:33.523 --> 03:38.692
Now, have they decided
to raise it Jewish or regular?

03:42.698 --> 03:44.965
Welcome to Texas.

03:44.967 --> 03:48.235
They haven't said.

03:49.338 --> 03:50.638
Anyway, we, uh, we also have

03:50.640 --> 03:52.373
some exciting news to share.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.875
Oh, wait, wait...
I... Shouldn't we just eat?

03:54.877 --> 03:57.678
You know, I mean, God did take
time out of his busy schedule

03:57.680 --> 03:59.947
to bless these Sloppy Joes.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.149
Come on, Shelly,
tell me your news.

04:02.151 --> 04:04.885
All right. This is on you.

04:04.887 --> 04:09.290
Amy and I are living together
in sin,

04:09.292 --> 04:12.560
like a couple of New Yorkers.

04:12.562 --> 04:16.230
Now, while you scold us, I'm
going to get a knife and a fork.

04:16.232 --> 04:18.265
Joe may be sloppy,
but Sheldon's not.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.570
Well, thank you
for letting me know,

04:22.572 --> 04:25.806
and I, for one, am thrilled.

04:27.343 --> 04:28.976
What?

04:28.978 --> 04:31.846
What... Where's the judgment?

04:31.848 --> 04:34.481
W-Where's the fire
and brimstone?

04:34.483 --> 04:36.617
Where's the part where you tell
us we're going to Hell

04:36.619 --> 04:38.118
and I say have you seen
the size of the bugs outside?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.286
We're already there!

04:40.590 --> 04:43.624
Obviously, I would prefer if you
weren't living out of wedlock,

04:43.626 --> 04:45.893
but given
your special circumstances,

04:45.895 --> 04:48.929
I'm very happy for you.

04:50.666 --> 04:55.102
And what "special circumstances"
are those?

04:55.104 --> 04:58.005
Oh, boy, I think it's
about to get bad.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.508
Shelly, how do I put this?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.144
By your third birthday,
you had memorized

05:04.146 --> 05:07.181
over a thousand different kinds
of trains,

05:07.183 --> 05:09.450
and I never imagined

05:09.452 --> 05:13.854
a woman getting aboard
any of them.

05:16.726 --> 05:19.927
What, so... You thought
I was going to be alone

05:19.929 --> 05:21.729
for the rest of my life?

05:21.731 --> 05:23.898
No! Just for the middle part.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.501
'Cause at the end
I assumed there'd be nurses.

05:29.038 --> 05:31.472
Well, this is highly insulting.

05:31.474 --> 05:33.207
Sheldon, don't overreact.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.276
I'm the child
she was worried about?

05:35.278 --> 05:36.610
I have a brother and sister

05:36.612 --> 05:38.345
whose combined
intellectual wattage

05:38.347 --> 05:40.581
couldn't power a potato clock,

05:40.583 --> 05:42.349
if I spotted them the potato.

05:45.821 --> 05:47.454
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:47.456 --> 05:50.658
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, <i>blah.</i>

05:50.660 --> 05:51.659
What?

05:51.661 --> 05:52.993
Well, I was in my room,

05:52.995 --> 05:54.895
I couldn't hear
what they were saying.

05:56.866 --> 05:59.199
I'll take over from here.

05:59.201 --> 06:02.303
He's been in there a long time.

06:02.305 --> 06:05.172
Should I go talk to him?

06:05.174 --> 06:07.808
He's upset with me. I should be
the one who talks to him.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.213
Are you going to?

06:13.215 --> 06:15.182
Oh, heck no.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:28.497 --> 06:32.266
Sheldon, what...
what are you doing?

06:32.268 --> 06:35.469
Just being
the un-socialized eccentric

06:35.471 --> 06:38.672
my mother
always thought I was.

06:39.809 --> 06:42.242
You startin' to see
why I didn't go in there?

06:43.546 --> 06:45.045
Sheldon, if you're trying
to prove me wrong,

06:45.047 --> 06:48.415
the tighty-whities on your head
ain't changing my mind.

06:49.385 --> 06:52.453
We're ignoring
the fins... Okay.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.189
Yeah. And I don't understand
why you're taking her side.

06:55.191 --> 06:58.192
By being my girlfriend, she's
saying you're a weirdo, too.

06:58.194 --> 07:00.361
I don't think that's
what she's saying.

07:00.363 --> 07:01.762
And...?

07:01.764 --> 07:04.531
That's exactly
what she was saying.

07:06.102 --> 07:08.202
Can you believe my mother
thinks we're both strange?

07:08.204 --> 07:09.870
Absolutely not!

07:09.872 --> 07:11.138
That's... too loud.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.674
Absolutely not.

07:14.857 --> 07:16.322
Well, after that,
Sheldon and I

07:16.323 --> 07:17.990
got out of the
house for a while.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.426
Well, first we buttered my feet
to get the swim fins off,

07:20.428 --> 07:21.760
and then we went out.

07:24.165 --> 07:26.231
You know, I'm sorry your
mother made you feel bad.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.734
But, you know, at the end
of the day, she was wrong,

07:28.736 --> 07:31.670
because you're not alone.

07:31.672 --> 07:33.372
You're right.

07:33.374 --> 07:35.474
I have Leonard
and Howard and Raj,

07:35.476 --> 07:38.277
Stuart, Penny,

07:38.279 --> 07:41.113
Leonard's mom, Bernadette,
Wil Wheaton...

07:41.115 --> 07:44.316
What about the woman who just
buttered your big flat feet?

07:45.152 --> 07:47.953
I was going chronologically.

07:47.955 --> 07:49.888
You're right between
Koothrappali's father

07:49.890 --> 07:52.925
and Omar, the one-eyed
Sparkletts guy.

07:52.927 --> 07:55.761
Well, let's try to not let it
ruin the rest of our trip.

07:55.763 --> 07:57.496
I knew we should've
never mentioned

07:57.498 --> 08:00.265
us living together
in the first place.

08:00.267 --> 08:01.900
She was gonna find out
eventually.

08:01.902 --> 08:03.135
Disagree.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.404
We've known about evolution
since 1859.

08:05.406 --> 08:09.341
She still believes in Noah
and his amazing zoo boat.

08:10.377 --> 08:11.710
This could have all been avoided

08:11.712 --> 08:13.378
if you'd only listened to me.

08:13.380 --> 08:16.048
Sheldon,

08:16.050 --> 08:18.196
I knew your mother was fine
with us living together

08:18.197 --> 08:20.130
because I already
told her we were.

08:22.319 --> 08:23.575
Why would you do that?

08:23.773 --> 08:25.473
This was a potential issue,

08:25.475 --> 08:27.208
so I got out ahead of it

08:27.210 --> 08:29.978
and I managed
the situation for you.

08:29.980 --> 08:33.548
You "managed the situation."

08:33.549 --> 08:34.749
That's right.

08:34.751 --> 08:37.684
So my mother thought I was
incapable of finding a mate,

08:37.687 --> 08:40.989
and my mate thinks I'm incapable
of running my own life.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.057
Not your whole life!

08:43.058 --> 08:44.892
I mean, science.
You got that.

08:44.894 --> 08:47.495
Organizing your sock drawer,
you're the king.

08:48.531 --> 08:51.332
But understanding
how other people are feeling,

08:51.334 --> 08:53.368
that's a weak spot for you.

08:53.370 --> 08:54.936
I have gotten
much better at that.

08:54.938 --> 08:58.373
Have you?
How am I feeling right now?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.541
What the... How should I know?

09:01.478 --> 09:04.846
Excited? Itchy?
Give me the first letter.

09:04.848 --> 09:07.915
You and I are in
a relationship.

09:07.917 --> 09:09.884
I help you with
your shortcomings,

09:09.886 --> 09:12.120
and you help me with mine.

09:12.122 --> 09:13.721
How would you feel
if I contacted

09:13.723 --> 09:15.390
your mother behind your back?

09:15.392 --> 09:19.260
Delighted that you showed any
interest in my family at all?

09:19.262 --> 09:20.695
"Delighted"?

09:20.697 --> 09:23.164
What... Not if I guessed
for a hundred years.

09:25.502 --> 09:27.802
Hi.
Hey, guys.

09:27.804 --> 09:29.971
Hey.
Hi. There's the little family!

09:29.973 --> 09:32.206
Hello.
Hello.

09:33.643 --> 09:35.443
And their Sherpas.
Mm-hmm.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.680
The baby's asleep,
can we put her in your room?

09:38.682 --> 09:40.315
Yeah. Go ahead.
Do you need help?

09:40.317 --> 09:42.183
No. I got it.

09:42.185 --> 09:44.452
Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.

09:47.190 --> 09:48.623
Sorry we're late.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.858
Oh, it's no problem, Amy and
Sheldon were just telling us

09:50.860 --> 09:52.126
about their trip to Texas.

09:52.128 --> 09:53.328
Yeah. Here.

09:53.330 --> 09:54.495
I'll catch you up.

09:54.497 --> 09:56.564
How did we get in the car?

09:56.566 --> 09:57.598
Stop.

09:59.035 --> 10:01.636
Okay. They told Mary
they were living together,

10:01.638 --> 10:03.805
there was a fight, he
got his feelings hurt,

10:03.807 --> 10:04.819
then he put underwear
on his head...

10:04.843 --> 10:05.774
On purpose,

10:05.775 --> 10:08.409
not the way it used to
happen in high school.

10:08.411 --> 10:12.747
I was acting odd
intentionally.

10:12.749 --> 10:15.216
Really? So you can control it?

10:17.787 --> 10:19.220
Okay. Then what happened?

10:19.222 --> 10:21.422
Well, there's really
not much left to tell.

10:21.424 --> 10:23.991
I decided that my mother
views me as a child

10:23.993 --> 10:26.027
because I never went through
a rebellious phase,

10:26.029 --> 10:28.463
so, I got an earring.

10:31.668 --> 10:34.202
My mother made me
take it out.

10:36.906 --> 10:39.574
Amy put alcohol on it.

10:42.278 --> 10:45.713
And here we are.

10:45.715 --> 10:47.048
What did we miss?

10:47.050 --> 10:49.784
I couldn't explain it
if I tried.

10:58.145 --> 11:01.713
So tell me, how did Sheldon
look with an earring?

11:01.715 --> 11:03.448
Like the pirate who helps
the other pirates

11:03.450 --> 11:07.052
connect to the Internet.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.154
So what did you
and Leonard do?

11:09.156 --> 11:11.623
Actually, we got in
a pretty nasty fight.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.425
It might've been
the worst one we've ever had.

11:13.427 --> 11:14.459
Oh, my God,
what happened?

11:14.461 --> 11:16.094
Well, we had started

11:16.096 --> 11:18.297
binge-watching
<i>Luke Cage</i> together,

11:18.299 --> 11:20.632
and it was kind of
our thing, and then,

11:20.634 --> 11:24.736
I find out that she watched
two episodes without me.

11:24.738 --> 11:29.508
It's like I was excited
for a present and got socks.

11:30.511 --> 11:32.144
I don't understand how
that turns into

11:32.146 --> 11:33.812
the worst fight of your life.

11:33.814 --> 11:36.114
I don't understand
what's wrong with socks.

11:36.116 --> 11:38.183
To be fair,
we may have been on edge

11:38.185 --> 11:39.918
because of the Christmas tree.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.054
What happened
with the tree?

11:47.661 --> 11:48.860
You do make a cute elf.

11:48.862 --> 11:50.195
Oh, yeah?

11:50.197 --> 11:54.333
And you thought Spock ears
were only good for Comic-Con.

11:54.335 --> 11:55.934
Hey, hey, I just found a farm

11:55.936 --> 11:57.936
where they let you chop down
your own tree.

11:57.938 --> 12:03.575
Oh cool, I'll be like
a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.

12:10.751 --> 12:13.318
Stupid idea.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.620
No, what's stupid is a physicist

12:15.622 --> 12:17.622
who doesn't understand
when you swing an axe,

12:17.624 --> 12:20.692
you don't let go.

12:20.694 --> 12:23.829
For the tenth time,
my mittens were slippery!

12:23.831 --> 12:25.130
Ugh.

12:25.132 --> 12:28.567
It's 70 degrees,
you didn't need mittens.

12:28.569 --> 12:31.870
You know how easily I blister.

12:31.872 --> 12:33.872
Yes, yes,
you bruise, you peel.

12:33.874 --> 12:37.776
It's like I'm married
to an old piece of fruit.

12:37.778 --> 12:40.212
Look, we could keep fighting
and let it ruin our night,

12:40.214 --> 12:43.081
or-or we can stop
and try to salvage the evening.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.217
Fine.
Thank you.

12:52.359 --> 12:53.358
Leonard?

12:53.360 --> 12:54.526
Yeah.

12:54.528 --> 12:58.864
There's something
on the windshield.

13:05.572 --> 13:07.239
You need a break?

13:07.241 --> 13:09.408
Do not need a break.

13:09.410 --> 13:10.909
There's no shame
in asking for a break.

13:10.911 --> 13:13.011
If I need a break,
I'll ask for a break!

13:13.013 --> 13:15.046
Ugh.

13:15.048 --> 13:16.114
Leonard?

13:16.116 --> 13:17.282
Yeah?

13:21.755 --> 13:23.588
There's a tree on you.

13:25.559 --> 13:28.093
Oh!

13:28.095 --> 13:29.261
Sh...

13:30.864 --> 13:31.997
Ooh.

13:31.999 --> 13:32.931
Ah.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.466
You want to
decorate it tonight?

13:34.468 --> 13:36.935
Yeah, with gasoline
and a match? Sure.

13:50.984 --> 13:54.753
I hope it kills us both.

13:54.755 --> 13:56.855
By the way,
if anyone asks,

13:56.857 --> 14:00.525
the elevator shaft
always had a tree in it.

14:00.527 --> 14:04.229
So Bernadette,
if I express

14:04.231 --> 14:07.899
interest in your baby will you
promise not to make me touch it?

14:07.901 --> 14:09.968
Sure.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.537
Hey, how's life
with your baby?

14:13.640 --> 14:15.707
Really? You're never
gonna touch their baby?

14:15.709 --> 14:18.577
To this day
I've never touched Stuart.

14:22.616 --> 14:26.451
It's been wonderful, Sheldon,
thanks for asking.

14:28.222 --> 14:31.022
Oh, please stop
crying, I'm begging you!

14:31.024 --> 14:32.924
I don't know what else to do!

14:32.926 --> 14:36.094
My boobs are empty.
Do you want lasagna?

14:39.700 --> 14:43.034
Shh, shh, shh,
it's okay, it's okay.

14:43.036 --> 14:44.769
Shh.

14:50.544 --> 14:52.744
What have we done?

14:53.947 --> 14:58.149
Hey, I found superhero
baby wipes,

14:58.151 --> 15:01.052
the perfect way
to clean up crime...

15:01.054 --> 15:02.487
and tushies.

15:03.924 --> 15:05.624
Ugh.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.726
It took me two hours
to get her down.

15:08.729 --> 15:12.464
Oh, you-you relax,
I'll take this shift.

15:12.466 --> 15:15.233
You know, in India when
my baby brother cried like that,

15:15.235 --> 15:17.002
the servants would
just take him far away

15:17.004 --> 15:19.404
so we couldn't hear it.

15:20.674 --> 15:24.409
Not always,
sometimes we'd leave.

15:27.347 --> 15:30.549
Hey, he got her to stop.

15:30.551 --> 15:32.050
That was so fast.

15:32.052 --> 15:33.218
Oh, he's really good with her.

15:33.220 --> 15:37.122
Yeah, he has a gift.

15:37.124 --> 15:39.691
What's the matter?

15:39.693 --> 15:42.761
Nothing,
these are happy tears.

15:42.763 --> 15:44.796
Oh, good.

15:44.798 --> 15:46.731
No they're not,
you bozo!

15:48.902 --> 15:53.438
How come Stuart can get her
to stop crying, but I can't?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.707
I mean, it's Stuart.

15:55.709 --> 16:00.579
Maybe she's playing possum
until he goes away.

16:00.581 --> 16:02.981
Not funny.

16:02.983 --> 16:06.084
She's tired, that was funny.

16:07.187 --> 16:10.322
Everyone's a better mom
than me.

16:10.324 --> 16:12.557
Oh, don't take it so personally,

16:12.559 --> 16:15.860
maybe your baby's just a jerk.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.701
Wait, so how does
the story end?

16:22.703 --> 16:26.137
Is the baby a jerk
or is Bernadette a bad mother?

16:27.341 --> 16:28.840
Sheldon!

16:28.842 --> 16:30.075
W-What?

16:30.077 --> 16:31.176
Is there
another twist coming?

16:31.178 --> 16:33.144
Is the baby
not theirs at all?

16:34.781 --> 16:35.880
Ignore him.

16:35.882 --> 16:37.749
How did you get
the baby to stop crying?

16:37.751 --> 16:41.119
Oh, I just talked to her.

16:41.121 --> 16:46.057
I've been told the sound of
my voice puts people to sleep.

16:49.630 --> 16:51.730
You poor things,
you must be exhausted.

16:51.732 --> 16:55.900
It has been hard to sleep
with all the crying.

17:01.808 --> 17:03.842
How can she hate me?

17:03.844 --> 17:06.944
I make her food
in my chest!

17:08.648 --> 17:13.318
It's like hating
a frozen yogurt machine.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.354
She doesn't hate you,
stop saying that.

17:16.356 --> 17:19.891
Now you hate me too!

17:19.893 --> 17:22.394
Shh, I don't hate you.

17:35.575 --> 17:39.277
It says here that
up to 80% of new mothers

17:39.279 --> 17:40.945
experience baby blues.

17:40.947 --> 17:42.580
And that
the best thing to do

17:42.582 --> 17:45.250
is reassure them that
they're doing a good job.

17:45.252 --> 17:46.217
Bernadette,

17:46.219 --> 17:50.522
you are doing
a good job.

17:50.524 --> 17:53.858
Thank you, Sheldon,
I'm feeling better now.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.460
Thank you, Internet.

17:55.462 --> 17:57.162
I'm telling you,
with the right YouTube video,

17:57.164 --> 17:59.831
I can give Howard
a vasectomy.

18:02.402 --> 18:04.436
So things started
to turn around?

18:04.438 --> 18:07.839
Yeah, eventually I figured out
how to get the baby to sleep.

18:07.841 --> 18:11.509
Please tell me you didn't use
Amy's magic juice.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.052
- Bernie?
- Shh.

18:21.054 --> 18:22.120
She's asleep.

18:22.122 --> 18:23.488
Great.

18:25.058 --> 18:28.426
And where are you?

18:28.428 --> 18:30.628
Down here.

18:40.874 --> 18:42.073
Oh.

18:42.075 --> 18:43.942
This is new.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.376
I didn't know
what else to do.

18:45.378 --> 18:47.645
It worked.

18:47.647 --> 18:50.682
Well, I'd say that's
thinking outside the box,

18:50.684 --> 18:52.917
but...
...come on.

18:55.422 --> 18:57.589
Don't make me laugh.

18:58.125 --> 19:01.126
Oh.

19:01.128 --> 19:02.994
Do you need help getting out?

19:02.996 --> 19:04.763
I think I live here now.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.100
It's fine.

19:09.102 --> 19:11.002
Is it okay if I get some sleep?

19:11.004 --> 19:12.837
Yeah, go ahead.

19:17.444 --> 19:18.710
Good job, Mommy.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.446
I'm proud of you.

19:21.448 --> 19:25.416
Don't make me cry, either.

19:25.418 --> 19:28.286
Good night.

19:28.288 --> 19:30.388
I love both my girls.

19:30.390 --> 19:32.557
We love you, too.

19:38.965 --> 19:40.498
I can't believe
you fit in the crib.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.434
I could take a bath
in the sink.

19:44.638 --> 19:47.071
I don't, but I can.

19:48.108 --> 19:49.941
So how were your holidays?

19:49.943 --> 19:51.843
Oh, thank you for asking.

19:51.845 --> 19:54.913
Uh, I, uh,
went to visit my grandmother.

19:54.915 --> 19:56.815
She's in Bakersfield.

19:56.817 --> 19:59.918
Uh, usually my brother
and sister go...

20:02.689 --> 20:04.889
Oh, come on!

20:14.011 --> 20:15.243
That was fun, thank you.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.578
Yeah, thanks.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.446
Our pleasure.
See you guys at work.

20:18.448 --> 20:19.648
Be there bright and early.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.149
Not me, paternity leave.
Oh!

20:21.151 --> 20:22.550
A small human

20:22.552 --> 20:24.152
wreaks havoc
on his wife's genitals

20:24.154 --> 20:26.755
and he gets time off.

20:26.757 --> 20:28.957
With pay, sucka!

20:33.030 --> 20:34.963
Forgot the baby,
still new to this.
