10:09.740 --> 10:11.332
RITUAL ASPECT WOULD KEEP
HIM AT THE SCENE LONGER,

10:11.370 --> 10:13.907
ESCALATE HIS RISK,
WHICH HE MAY GET OFF ON.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.976
AND GOING WITH LUKE'S THEORY,

10:16.010 --> 10:18.649
THE WOMAN HE PINES FOR
MAY WEAR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.671
UM, THEY'RE
PRETTY DATED.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.881
I'M NOT SURE WE SHOULD
LIMIT IT TO ROMANCE.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.686
THESE FEEL MORE LIKE
SOMETHING A MOTHER
OR A TEACHER WOULD WEAR.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.210
IT'S ALSO STRANGE
HOW PRIVATE HE MADE IT.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.784
I MEAN, THE PLACEMENT
OF THESE CLIPS

10:29.830 --> 10:31.821
MAKES IT REALLY
DIFFICULT TO SEE.

10:31.860 --> 10:35.091
EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS TO BE SEEN.

10:35.130 --> 10:39.089
SO WHY IS THE UNSUB
HIDING THIS?

10:39.130 --> 10:40.791
WELL, LET'S CHECK
WITH THE MANUFACTURER
OF THOSE CLIPS,

10:40.840 --> 10:42.398
SEE WHERE THEY'RE SOLD.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.532
THAT COULD BE A GOOD
STARTING POINT.

10:43.570 --> 10:46.778
MY GUESS IS ONLINE
AND IN EVERY DRUGSTORE
ACROSS MIAMI.

10:46.810 --> 10:49.335
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THEY'RE ONLY VISIBLE
IN OFFICIAL CSPs.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.177
THEY CAN'T BE SEEN ANYWHERE
IN MEDIA COVERAGE.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.916
GREAT.
THAT'LL BUY US SOME TIME

10:52.950 --> 10:55.874
BEFORE THE PUBLIC FINDS OUT.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.410
WHAT THE...

11:02.220 --> 11:04.780
HOW DOES
CHANNEL 3 KNOW?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.128
LET'S FIND OUT.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.393
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND
OF THING THAT WE NEEDED.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.135
GREAT WORK, KAL.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.398
MM-HMM.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.839
SO NOW
WE HAVE TO NAME HIM--

11:17.870 --> 11:20.304
SOMETHING EVOCATIVE,
LIKE SON OF SAM

11:20.340 --> 11:23.207
OR BTK OR ZODIAC.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.945
ANYONE?

11:24.980 --> 11:26.140

LION FROM THE ZOO?

11:36.860 --> 11:39.021

11:40.160 --> 11:42.219
THE NEON TERROR

11:42.260 --> 11:44.820
STRIKES AGAIN.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.497
NAMING THE UNSUB
IS A GRAVE MISTAKE.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.464
IT ROMANTICIZES HIM
IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND

11:48.500 --> 11:51.003
AND IN TURN GIVES HIM
A SENSE OF POWER AND CONTROL

11:51.040 --> 11:52.507
HE DESPERATELY CRAVES.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.907

I'M SANDRA MADSEN.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.373
I'M THE NEWS

FOR YOU?

11:59.410 --> 12:01.878

WE CAN TALK?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.410

EVERYONE.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.779
WE CAN TALK OVER HERE.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.983
I'VE NEVER HAD A VISIT
FROM THE FBI BEFORE.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.520
IT MUST BE
IMPORTANT.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.949
HOW CAN I HELP
YOU, AGENTS?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.764
WELL, WE SAW YOUR REPORT
ON THE MATCHING CLIPS

12:17.800 --> 12:19.290

VICTIMS' HAIR.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.968

JUST MADE

12:22.500 --> 12:24.331
THAT SAME
CONNECTION OURSELVES.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.531
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

12:26.570 --> 12:27.935
WELL,
WE HERE AT CHANNEL 3

12:27.980 --> 12:29.333
ARE ABLE
TO MAKE DEDUCTIONS

12:29.380 --> 12:32.372
BASED ON THE FOOTAGE,
SAME AS THE FBI.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.913
ROSSI: OF COURSE.
BUT THE THING IS,

12:34.950 --> 12:37.919
YOU CAN'T SEE THE CLIPS
IN THE MEDIA FOOTAGE,

12:37.950 --> 12:41.078
ONLY IN THE OFFICIAL
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.826
JJ: THE KILLER
MUST HAVE REACHED OUT

12:42.860 --> 12:44.259
TO ONE OF YOUR
REPORTERS?

12:44.290 --> 12:46.554
NO, IF HE DID,
I'D KNOW.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.559
WE GOT THOSE PHOTOS
FROM A PROTECTED SOURCE.

ON THE POLICE FORCE.

ANY MORE QUESTIONS

ON MY SIDE OF THE ROOM

TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

ME TO COMPROMISE

INTEGRITY,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.818
I HAVE TO DRAW
THE LINE.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.181
WELL, UM, IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND,

13:18.230 --> 13:20.027
WE'D REALLY
APPRECIATE A CALL.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.254

OF HER ON CAMERA.

COVERED EVERYTHING,

ON THE FRONT LINES.

THE AWARDS STOPPED COMING.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.890
THEN BECOMING
A NEWS DIRECTOR

13:52.930 --> 13:54.591
WOULD BE A DEMOTION
FOR SOMEONE LIKE HER.

13:54.630 --> 13:57.360

OK, THE FIRST PART,
THE PART HE'S PROBABLY
NOT AWARE OF,

17:58.340 --> 17:59.364
IS WHO HE'S KILLING.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.334
OK. WE BELIEVE THE VICTIMS
REPRESENT A PERSONAL LOSS.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.599
IT'S MOST LIKELY A MATERNAL
FIGURE OR A CAREGIVER.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.346
THE HAIR CLIP
IS HIS SYMBOLIC WAY

18:08.380 --> 18:11.144

INTO THAT WOMAN.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.512

THAT HE'S VERY AWARE OF...

18:14.560 --> 18:17.324

RESPOND TO WHAT HE'S DONE.

AND HE WILL RESPOND IN KIND.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.509
RIGHT NOW HE'S PLANNING FOR
THE BIGGEST BANG POSSIBLE.

18:46.550 --> 18:49.348
RATINGS, LIKES,
SHARES ON SOCIAL MEDIA

18:49.390 --> 18:50.652
PROBABLY ALL MATTER TO HIM,

18:50.690 --> 18:52.487
SO HE COULD BE
TRACKING THEM.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.828
PRENTISS: AND BECAUSE
HE'S NO LONGER FOCUSED
ON PUBLIC CRIME SCENES,

18:54.860 --> 18:58.398
WE ARE ASKING ALL OF YOU
TO COVER AS MUCH GROUND
AS POSSIBLE

18:58.430 --> 19:00.295
INSIDE HIS HUNTING ZONE.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.262
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT THE INFORMATION

19:02.300 --> 19:05.406
SHARED IN THIS PROFILE
IS NOT POSTED ONLINE

19:05.440 --> 19:06.839
OR LEAKED TO THE MEDIA.

19:06.870 --> 19:09.304
DOING SO COULD FURTHER
EMBOLDEN HIM

19:09.340 --> 19:10.671
AND CAUSE HIM
TO ESCALATE.

19:10.710 --> 19:12.678
THANK YOU, ALL.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.823
IT FEELS LIKE
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
EVERY MEDIA MEMBER

19:26.860 --> 19:28.350
IN THE CITY, AND WE
STILL GOT NOTHING.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.528
EVEN THOSE CHANNEL 3
JAG-OFFS CHECKED OUT.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.936
WELL, MAYBE HE'S NOT
A JOURNALIST.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.699
WHAT IS HE, THEN?

19:35.740 --> 19:38.459
HE COULD JUST BE
A DIGITAL LONER.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.375
YOU SEE LOTS OF GUYS
AND GIRLS LIKE THAT
THESE DAYS.

19:40.410 --> 19:43.277
THEY HAVE THE IMPULSE
TO CATALOG THEIR LIVES

19:43.310 --> 19:45.744
NO MATTER HOW MUNDANE IT IS
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

19:45.780 --> 19:49.318
HE COULD BE CATALOGING
THESE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
RIGHT NOW.

19:49.350 --> 19:50.510
THAT'S
AN INTERESTING IDEA,

19:50.550 --> 19:51.881
BUT HOW DOES HE
GET IN AND OUT

19:51.920 --> 19:53.456
OF THE CRIME SCENE
UNNOTICED?

19:53.490 --> 19:55.412
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF WHY
I'M HITTING THE WALL, TOO.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.950
I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT
HAVE A WAY AROUND IT.

19:56.990 --> 20:00.494
JJ: HEY, GUYS, LOOK AT THIS.

20:00.530 --> 20:05.467
OK, SO THIS WAS TAKEN FROM
JUST INSIDE LINDSEY'S GARAGE.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.968
WHAT'S MISSING?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.366
THE COPS.
THEY'RE NOT THERE YET.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.401
BUT THEY RESPONDED
WITHIN MINUTES.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.907
SO WHOEVER
FILMED THIS

20:13.940 --> 20:15.532
HAD TO BE THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.605
WELL, THIS WAS FILMED
BY A KAL MONTGOMERY

20:17.650 --> 20:19.447
AT CHANNEL 3.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.744
I CHECKED THEIR SITE.
HE'S ON THEIR I.T. STAFF.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.486
FIRST CHANNEL 3
BREAKS THE STORY

20:23.520 --> 20:25.442
ABOUT THE HAIR CLIPS,
AND NOW THIS.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.843
WELL, IF HE'S NOT
A CAMERAMAN OR A REPORTER,

20:26.890 --> 20:28.551
HE WOULDN'T SHOW UP
ON OUR SWEEP.

20:28.590 --> 20:29.852
OH, AND I DOUBLE-CHECKED.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.926
HIS NAME IS ON EVERY
NEON TERROR CRIME SCENE

20:31.960 --> 20:34.224
CHANNEL 3's PUT ON THE NEWS.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.859
SIMMONS: ALL RIGHT. I GOT HIM.
FOUND HIM ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.391
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S POSTED
MULTIPLE RANTS

20:43.810 --> 20:46.461
WHO LOOKS A LOT
LIKE OUR VICTIMS.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.899
ROSSI: SOUNDS LIKE
A DIGITAL LONER TO ME.

20:48.940 --> 20:52.501
LET'S GO HAVE
A CHAT WITH KAL.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.939
GREAT WORK, PEOPLE!

20:54.980 --> 20:56.914
OUR OVERNIGHT RATINGS ARE UP,

20:56.950 --> 20:58.941
AND TRAFFIC TO OUR SITE'S
QUADRUPLED

20:58.990 --> 21:00.480
SINCE THE STORY BROKE.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.683
WE NEED TO TALK
TO KAL MONTGOMERY.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.721
SANDRA: I DO HOPE
YOU HAVE THAT WARRANT.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.421
HE'S A PERSON
OF INTEREST

21:07.460 --> 21:09.394
IN A SERIAL MURDER
CASE.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.795
UH...

21:10.830 --> 21:12.661
KAL, YOU'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO ANYONE

21:12.700 --> 21:13.860
UNTIL THERE'S
A LAWYER PRESENT.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.494
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SANDRA.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.962
I'M FINE.

21:19.610 --> 21:21.498
LET'S GO TO MY OFFICE.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.545
ON THIS STORY, KAL.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.342
THANK YOU.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.519
YOUR VIDEO FROM
THE LAST CRIME SCENE

21:31.550 --> 21:33.859
WAS TAKEN BEFORE
THE POLICE ARRIVED?

21:33.890 --> 21:35.050
WHY IS THAT?

21:35.090 --> 21:36.512
I HEARD THE CALL
ON THE SCANNER.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.822
I WAS IN THE AREA,
SO I WENT.

21:37.860 --> 21:40.624
SANDRA LETS ME GO
IN THE FIELD AND SHOOT VIDEO.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.423
YOU'RE A REAL
JOHNNY ON THE SPOT.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.429
JJ: THEN HOW COME THE POLICE
NEVER TOOK YOUR STATEMENT?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.823
WELL, THAT WAS ON ME.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.997
WE HAD TO BREAK THE STORY
BEFORE WE GOT SCOOPED.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.598
ROSSI: YOU KNOW, KAL,
THERE'S MORE TO IT

21:50.640 --> 21:51.868
THAN JUST FLEEING THE SCENE.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.673
THERE'S THE QUESTION
ABOUT YOUR EX,

21:53.710 --> 21:56.008
THE ONE YOU'RE TRASHING
ON SOCIAL MEDIA,

21:56.040 --> 21:58.543
THE ONE THAT LOOKS
LIKE THE VICTIMS.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.878
YOU SEE HOW IT
ADDS UP, KAL?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.569
JJ: YEAH, IT LOOKS TO US

22:02.620 --> 22:04.383
LIKE YOU KILLED STEVEN

22:04.420 --> 22:07.389
AND ALL THOSE WOMEN.

22:07.420 --> 22:10.651
I...I--I LIED.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.089
I DIDN'T FILM ANY OF IT.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.595
SANDRA: WAIT. WHAT?

22:15.630 --> 22:18.360
KAL: ONE DAY, SOME STRANGER
SENDS ME A VIDEO

22:18.400 --> 22:19.958
OF THE FIRST CRIME SCENE,
TELLS ME IT'S A GIFT,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.561
THAT I SHOULD POST IT
AS MY OWN, SO I DID.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.703
WHO DID THIS
STRANGER SAY HE WAS?

22:25.740 --> 22:28.402
KAL: A MIAMI COP,
WHICH MADE EVEN MORE SENSE

22:28.440 --> 22:29.771
WHEN HE SENT CLOSE-UPS
OF THE HAIR CLIPS.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.698
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
OFFICIAL CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.809
OK, WE'RE GONNA NEED
ALL OF THAT RAW FOOTAGE.

22:33.850 --> 22:36.512
I DON'T HAVE IT.
HE ALWAYS SENDS
THE VIDEOS EDITED.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.017
I'LL SHOW YOU.
CAN I?

22:38.050 --> 22:39.711
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.765
JJ: WHO IS QUASAR 22?

22:58.810 --> 23:00.607
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.938
I CAN TELL YOU
WITH 100% CERTAINTY

23:02.980 --> 23:04.902
IT IS NOT KAL MONTGOMERY.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.599
HIS STORY COMPLETELY
CHECKS OUT.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.947
ASIDE FROM BEING SLIGHTLY
MORALLY REPUGNANT,

23:07.980 --> 23:09.447
HE'S CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.084
IF THAT WHISTLE WAS SLIGHTLY
MORALLY REPUGNANT.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.644
SIMMONS: SO THAT CLEARS HIM.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.658
BUT WHY DID THE UNSUB
TARGET KAL TO BEGIN WITH?

23:14.690 --> 23:15.679
KAL'S AMBITIOUS.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.723
HE MUST HAVE KNOWN IT
AND USED IT TO HIS BENEFIT.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.625
SO HE'S SMART ENOUGH
NOT TO EXPOSE HIMSELF,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.525
WHICH IS PROBABLY
NOT EASY FOR SOMEONE

23:22.560 --> 23:23.766
WHO'S DESPERATE
FOR ATTENTION.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.097
GARCIA: ALSO, I HAVE
TO SAY WHOEVER THIS IS

23:25.130 --> 23:26.722
IS, LIKE, A TECH WIZARD.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.658
BECAUSE I HAVE USED
ALL THE TOOLS

23:28.700 --> 23:31.066
IN MY FANTASTIC BOX,
AND HE'S, LIKE, PROTECTED

23:31.110 --> 23:33.635
FROM THE MOTHER ON HIGH
OF ALL ENCRYPTION PACKAGES

23:33.680 --> 23:35.079
AND A SECURE SERVER,

23:35.110 --> 23:36.338
PLUS AN IP SCRAMBLER,

23:36.380 --> 23:39.747
WHICH IS NOT LIKE
THE WARM, EGGY KIND
BUT THE COMPUTERY KIND.

23:39.780 --> 23:42.943
SO YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
ON THE UNSUB'S I.D.
AND LOCATION?

23:42.980 --> 23:44.982
NO. I MEAN,
ACCORDING TO MY SCREENS,

23:45.020 --> 23:46.612
IT'S ALL COMING
FROM JAMAICA.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.049

TO BE EXACT.

23:48.090 --> 23:49.614
IT DOES NOT TAKE
A PROFILER TO KNOW

23:49.660 --> 23:51.059
THAT'S COMPLETELY BOGUS.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.648
WELL, IF HE REACHED OUT
TO CHANNEL 3,

23:52.690 --> 23:53.952
THEN HE MIGHT HAVE TO
OTHER NEWS OUTLETS, TOO.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.922
GARCIA, DID HE SEND
THE VIDEOS TO ANYBODY ELSE?

23:55.960 --> 23:58.064
JUST--JUST KAL
AT CHANNEL 3. THAT'S IT.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.727
IF THE UNSUB
IS FOCUSED ON THEM,

23:59.770 --> 24:01.465
HE MUST HAVE A PERSONAL
CONNECTION THERE.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.730
GARCIA, LOOK INTO FORMER
CHANNEL 3 EMPLOYEES,

24:03.770 --> 24:05.658
SEE IF ANY OF THEM
FIT THE PROFILE.

ABOUT THIS GUY?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.702
IS IT THE FACT THAT KAL
MIGHT WIN A LOCAL NEWS
EMMY OFF HIM?

THE MURDER

24:17.020 --> 24:19.739

AND AT SOME POINT,

24:21.020 --> 24:22.681
THAT'S GONNA CONVERGE.

HE WAS GOING
FOR A BIGGER BANG.

24:27.190 --> 24:29.829

A SNUFF FILM.

WAS ASLEEP,
