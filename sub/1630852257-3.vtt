- Hello Bakers,
I'm your old pal, Maya Rudolph.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.266
- And I'm Andy Sandberg.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.185
And yes, we are going
to introduce ourselves

01:00.226 --> 01:02.020
by name every single day.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.065
- Here at "Baking It," we love
watching you work together.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.193
So, today we're going to have
you work even more together.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.361
- Together-er.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.571
- Together-est.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.449
<i>In our Short & Sweet
challenge,</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:15.784
we're combining your teams

01:15.825 --> 01:18.912
into two super teams
of six bakers each.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.246
- Cool.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.956
- That's awesome.
- A baker's half dozen.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.500
One super team will be naughty.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.794
The other, get this...

01:25.835 --> 01:27.045
nice.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.880
- Ooh.
- You're nice.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.840
- We've hung stockings
for all six teams

01:30.882 --> 01:32.509
above our fireplace.

01:32.550 --> 01:36.638
- Each stocking contains either
a candy cane or a lump of coal.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.640
<i>Coal means
you're on Team Naughty.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:40.642
<i>- A candy cane means
you're on Team Nice.</i>

01:40.684 --> 01:42.477
<i>- The two teams
will use items</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:44.854
<i>from our table of naughty
and nice ingredients</i>

01:44.896 --> 01:46.773
<i>to create
their group bakes.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.817
- You look naughty.
- Also, before you ask,

01:48.858 --> 01:50.485
we got you team uniforms.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.487
- Oh, my God.
- You're welcome.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.240
Team Nice, you get halos.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.410
And Team Naughty,
you're straight-up horny.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.414
We don't make the rules.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.665
- We actually do.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.667
Bakers, you will have
one hour to create

02:05.709 --> 02:07.877
your naughty and nice treats.
So...

02:09.796 --> 02:11.423
Let's get baking!

02:11.464 --> 02:13.341
- Whoo!
- Oh, wow.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.846
- Move it or lose it, suckers.
- I think this is us.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.848
- What did we get?
- Oh, candy cane.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.932
- Oh, we're nice!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.143
- We absolutely belong
on Team Nice.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.394
We're nice girls.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.353
- What do we got?
What do we got?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.813
Ahh!
-

02:26.855 --> 02:27.897
I've always wanted
to be naughty.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.190
- I know, me too.
- I've always wanted

02:29.232 --> 02:30.233
to be naughty.
- Who else has got coal?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.234
- It's a lump of coal.
- Yes.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.990
- We named the challenge
Naughty or Nice,

02:37.032 --> 02:38.116
but there's a million things

02:38.158 --> 02:39.075
that have been
called Naughty or Nice,

02:39.117 --> 02:40.326
right?
- Yeah.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.536
There's like
three movies from the '80s

02:41.578 --> 02:43.079
that are called
"Naughty or Nice."

02:43.121 --> 02:44.289
- Prince's backup dancers,

02:44.330 --> 02:45.540
I'm pretty sure
were called that.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.958
- Yeah.
- There was that website

02:47.000 --> 02:49.294
that I caught you
looking at called that.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.881
- I'm thinking lamb.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.632
That's easy to do.
That's quick.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.469
- I can't wait to be
with all the team

02:57.510 --> 02:59.554
because we have
some amazing teammates.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.847
<i>- You know,
Gerard and Shawn,</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:02.515
they bring a lot of spice
to the table.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.225
Biscuits.
- We have a bit of cream--

03:04.267 --> 03:05.435
We could do
cream cheese biscuits.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.187
- Sharon and Mike,
they'll obviously bring

03:07.228 --> 03:08.229
their level
of sophistication.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.898
- I'm thinking something spicy.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.941
Plus we have the horns now.
- Of course, you are.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.610
<i>- And we are all
about flavors too,</i>

03:13.651 --> 03:15.987
so I think
it'll be a great mix.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.739
- I gotta be honest.
It's hard to take you seriously

03:17.781 --> 03:20.033
with your horns.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.409
- I think we should do
something savory with like

03:21.451 --> 03:23.119
a sweeter element though.
- Okay.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.497
We are so excited
to be baking

03:25.538 --> 03:27.415
with Steve and Tom,
and Jonah--

03:27.457 --> 03:28.416
<i>- Jonah and Patrick.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:29.584
- What's the bake element?

03:29.626 --> 03:30.919
- How about a biscuit?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.462
- Biscuits are good.
I like a biscuit.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.589
- Their baking styles
are so different from ours.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.715
So I think we're going
to learn a lot

03:35.757 --> 03:37.050
from this challenge as well.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.635
- So, let's--so, let's
do a thinly-sliced

03:38.677 --> 03:40.095
piece of fried chicken.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.930
- Like chicken and waffles,
chicken and biscuits.

03:41.971 --> 03:42.847
Yeah.

03:42.889 --> 03:43.765
- That right now?
- We got it?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.766
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.352
Ready?
Team Nice!

03:55.026 --> 03:57.237

and roll 'em.

03:58.488 --> 04:02.617
<i>- * Friendship,

04:02.659 --> 04:03.618

a little bit

04:03.660 --> 04:04.619
of parmesan
in that right now?

04:04.661 --> 04:05.787
- Sure,
- Should we do that?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.622
- Absolutely.
How much do you want?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
- Hit it till you see it.
Give it like a little mix

04:09.249 --> 04:10.834

who knows?

04:10.875 --> 04:13.211
Do whatever feels
right in your heart.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.629

Hi.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.047
- Good, how are you?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.465
- Is this Team Nice?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.801
- We're so nice.
Can't you tell?

04:19.843 --> 04:22.303
- I had a feeling.
- Yeah.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.347
- Jessica, what are
you guys making?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.683
- We have a list of ingredients
that we can choose from

04:26.725 --> 04:28.852
<i>that are all nice foods.</i>

04:28.893 --> 04:30.812
<i>So we decide to use
the chicken breast</i>

04:30.854 --> 04:32.689
<i>and we're going to do
a fried chicken and biscuit</i>

04:32.731 --> 04:35.817
<i>with some herb butter
and a little bit of honey.</i>

04:35.859 --> 04:37.902
- Have you ever gotten coal
on Christmas?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.195
- I'm a good girl.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.238
- I had a feeling.
- Yeah.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.656
- Have you ever?

04:41.698 --> 04:42.907
- You know, two days
after Christmas, one time,

04:42.949 --> 04:44.284
my brother was, like,
"Steve, there's one more

04:44.325 --> 04:47.287
Christmas present under
the tree that you forgot."

04:47.328 --> 04:49.539
And I went and opened it up
and it was coal and he did it.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.583
- He really did it?
- Yeah, he did it.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.835
- Um, How do you think
this team is going so far?

04:53.877 --> 04:55.670
- Um, it's great.
- Really great.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.339
- We--I was so excited
when we found out

04:57.380 --> 04:58.340
we were working
with these guys.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.799
We just love them so much.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.053
And they bake a totally
different style than we do.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.013
They're much more, like, fly
by the seat of your pants.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.014
Figure it out as you go.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.307
We're like down to the gram,
so--

05:07.349 --> 05:08.433
- That's interesting.
So you're--

05:08.475 --> 05:09.476
you're baking out
of your comfort zone.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.019
- Yeah, for sure.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.480
- Let's go check on those dudes
breading that raw meat.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.859
- Well, hello.
Welcome to Team Chicken.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.486
- Oh.
What are you guys doing?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.529
- We are dredging chicken

05:21.571 --> 05:23.073
'cause we're going to
fry it later.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.115
- Ooh.
- Yes.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.117
- It's called dredging?
Yes.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.535
- I dredge that term.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.953
- I d--
Oh, dang it, you beat me.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.751
<i>The chicken is dredged
in buttermilk, flour,</i>

05:34.793 --> 05:36.544
<i>and a little bit
of powdered sugar, actually.</i>

05:36.586 --> 05:38.296
- It was a great trick
that Tom taught us.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.173
It will give it
some caramelization on the end.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.677
- Is there a team leader here?
- Yes, Steven.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.387
- Yes.
- Really? Did he--did he--

05:45.428 --> 05:46.721
- He just took it.
- He took it.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.722
- His generation, am I right?

05:47.764 --> 05:48.807
- Yeah, that's how it goes.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.974
- His generation
is very comfortable.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.185
- They just take
and they take--am I right?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.937
- ...we're doing right now.
Look at him.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.438
- Oh, boy.
- I'm just kidding.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.940
I heard my name.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.316
- How do you feel about
taking orders from your son?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.068
- I love it.
- Do you?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.070
- Oh yeah. I've been
giving them all my life.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.572
It's so nice
to be out of that role.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.824
- I see.
You're ready to receive.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.325
- Now, the grandkids,
whatever they want.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.994
- That's the grandparent role
is you ply them with sugar

06:10.036 --> 06:11.162
and then they melt down,

06:11.204 --> 06:12.163
and you take off.
- And then you go home.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.790
- I say, "See you.
Papa loves you!"

06:13.832 --> 06:15.500
- Whenever anybody's
melting down,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.794
I just go, "Papa loves you!"

06:17.836 --> 06:19.212
<i>- So, the butter
that we're gonna do</i>

06:19.254 --> 06:20.755
on top of the biscuits,
we're gonna do black pepper,

06:20.797 --> 06:22.632
a teeny, tiny bit of
cayenne,

06:22.674 --> 06:23.883
and we're thinking about
throwing

06:23.925 --> 06:26.428
one of those peppers in
just for flavor.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.762
- Oh, I love that.
I love that.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.099
- Mike!
- Hey.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.142
- G-Money.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.143
- Hey, what's going on?

06:33.184 --> 06:34.477
- Ooh!
- G-Money!

06:34.519 --> 06:36.021
- What's happening
over here?

06:37.355 --> 06:41.276
- Mmm, someone looks very good
in their horns.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.404
How do you guys feel about, uh,
being on Team Naughty?

06:45.155 --> 06:46.448
- I've always wanted
to be naughty.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.615
- Oh.
- Always.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.950
- Got it.
- Dream of mine.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.952
- Talk to me about
what you guys are making.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.620
- When I saw
those ingredients--

06:52.662 --> 06:54.789
- Ooh.
- I was like, "Let's go."

06:54.831 --> 06:56.124
<i>Team Naughty is about
to blow your mind.</i>

06:56.166 --> 06:57.792
<i>We're making
lamb lollipops</i>

06:57.834 --> 06:59.669
<i>with a spicy sauce</i>

06:59.711 --> 07:01.963
<i>and a cream cheese
pepper biscuit.</i>

07:02.005 --> 07:03.214
- What are you dripping
onto those chops?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.425
- Butter. Butter.
Butter makes it better.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.177
- He said butter.
- Yeah.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.639
- These are
cream cheese biscuits

07:11.681 --> 07:13.475
with black pepper and--

07:13.516 --> 07:15.643
- A little bit of Árbol...

07:15.685 --> 07:17.187
- Whoo-hoo.
- Peppers.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.439
- So they have
a little kick at the end.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.690
- The grannies
can take the heat.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.192
That's why I was asking that.
- I know.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.069
- Well, they're gonna get it,
I think.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.820
- Yeah, we're going to test
their threshold,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.489
I think.
- Hopefully, they like it.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.324
- It actually feels like
the holidays in here right now.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.658
- It does.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.659
- Feels like everyone's
getting together--

07:31.701 --> 07:33.244
- You can hear
the jingle bells.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.955
- That's Andy.
- We are inside a snow globe.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.541
You gonna try
that grain alcohol today?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.086
A little hit of
the grain alco-hool.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.087
- Yeah!

07:45.632 --> 07:47.050
- What is he doing,
tasting things?

07:47.092 --> 07:48.468
- He's tasting
the grain alcohol.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.844
- Oh, my gosh.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.970
It's a little early for that,
isn't it, Andy?

07:51.012 --> 07:51.930
- Is that where the grain
alcohol went?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.932
- Don't worry about it,
Patrick.

with this--with this...
- Southern-style--

08:08.697 --> 08:10.740
- Southern-style honey glaze.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.242
- Honey glaze.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.369
- In Indian culture
or Trinidadian culture,

08:14.411 --> 08:16.287
we love some curry.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.997
- Do you think it would pair
well with grain alcohol?

08:18.039 --> 08:19.332
'Cause I just had some of that.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.918
- This guy just did--
this guys just did a shot.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.503
- I mean it's 5:00 p.m.
somewhere.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.672
- Right.
- Exactly.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.549
- So both teams
are making biscuits,

08:27.590 --> 08:28.842
uh, because everyone knows

08:28.883 --> 08:31.052
that biscuits transcend
naughtiness or niceness.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.139
- Mm-hmm.
- Also, both are considered

08:34.180 --> 08:35.265
a compliment, like,

08:35.306 --> 08:37.726
"Naughty biscuits"
or "Nice biscuits.'

08:37.767 --> 08:39.978
-
Or like, "Oh, biscuits."

08:41.896 --> 08:43.189
- That's not naughty or nice.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.734
- No, it's just
disappointed and forlorn.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.777
-
Ohh, biscuits.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.326
<i>- I know we've had
a couple of little twists</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:56.953
<i>and surprises so far.
- Mm.</i>

08:56.995 --> 08:59.497
- But today, we're doing
a really big twist.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.665
- Really big twist.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.708
- Massive.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.543
- Huge.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.339
- It's two teams.
Not so much like a twist--

09:07.380 --> 09:09.215
- It's like a gentle curve.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.803
- Being naughty or nice does
not affect the flow of time.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.347
You have five minutes left.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.681
- You're scaring me.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.849
- G, watch your back.
- You got it.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.100
- Right here.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.352
- That is gorgeous.
Just like that.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.312
- Can I have the butter back?
Thanks.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.605
- I've got more peppers
right here for you,

09:23.646 --> 09:24.522
so you don't have
to turn around.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.690
- Thank you.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.733
- Yeah, that's--
that one's too pale.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.485
Want to try these?
- Oh, beautiful.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.652
- This is very naughty.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.862
- This is so naughty.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.030
- We can just go
down the middle

09:32.072 --> 09:33.531
of the herb like that.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.075
- Can you grab that?

09:35.116 --> 09:40.997
Five, four,
three, two, one.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.667
- Time's up.
Whoo.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.168

Don't you?

10:36.845 --> 10:39.055
- That fried chicken is tasty.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.766
Nicely spiced,
that hint of sweetness.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.685

Doesn't it?

10:44.769 --> 10:45.895
- What is your batter?

10:45.937 --> 10:49.983

10:51.443 --> 10:53.695
And then frozen for about
five minutes in the freezer.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.946
- Frozen?
- Put it in the freezer

10:54.988 --> 10:56.072
for five minutes.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.491
- So the freezer sets it.
- Yeah.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.784

10:59.826 --> 11:01.244
- I would've just liked
a little more

11:01.286 --> 11:03.204

- Yeah.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.290
- But what'd you use
for the, um, biscuit?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.499
Lard? Butter?

11:06.541 --> 11:07.959
- Both.
- Both?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.420
It's really good,

are some cream cheese

more onions 'cause they--

you must share.

- Oh, my.
Mmm-mm-mm.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.306
Those biscuits are so peppery--

12:03.348 --> 12:05.767
- And so light.
- They're so good.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.144
- The pepper comes through
so beau--

12:08.186 --> 12:09.854
I mean, it opened up
my sinuses,

12:09.896 --> 12:11.147
just taking a bite.
- Nice.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.565

It's delicious.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.279

your lamb chops.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.031
- Yes, I do.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.701
- Because I'm
a lamb chop connoisseur.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.868
- Okay.
- Probably would have

12:23.910 --> 12:26.746
took it out at 1...maybe 42.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.415
- 142 and let it keep--
- Yeah.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.875
'Cause I just like mine
just a little bit more rare.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.003
Other than that,
I'd eat them every day.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.504
- Thank you.
Thank you.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.215
- I'd like a little more sauce
because I'm a sauce girl.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.758
- There's sauce on the plate,
actually.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.843

12:51.062 --> 12:53.398
- Naughty.
- I love it.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.736
- You know, we try to stay
pretty non-denominational

12:57.777 --> 12:59.612
on the show, but, uh,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.156
on this one in particular,

13:01.197 --> 13:03.533
we're just going straight
biblical angels and demons.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.618
- Yeah, devils from hell.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.666
- Just like angelic angels
and then just demons.

13:11.708 --> 13:16.004
Just straight-up devils,
you know, from down below.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.881
- You did a good job
of contrasting

13:17.922 --> 13:19.466
that tempting lamb chop

13:19.507 --> 13:22.552
with that sweet
and tender fried chicken

13:22.594 --> 13:23.470
on his biscuit.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.347
So it's really
a nice contrast.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.307
You guys did a really good job.
- It's a very good contrast.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.185
- They were both
beautifully-executed biscuits.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.770
- But it's amazing
that they're so different.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.146
- They're so different.
- I mean, the biscuit--

13:33.188 --> 13:35.231
a good biscuit i--

13:35.273 --> 13:37.525
I could live in a good biscuit.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.778
I could go to sleep
in a good biscuit.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.073
- Truly naughty with
the pepper in it, you know.

13:43.114 --> 13:46.201
And of course, y'all angels...
good?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.535
What--what is it?
- Nice.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.580
- Nice. Nice.
Nice, Harriet, nice, nice!

13:50.622 --> 13:53.833
They're just floating away
just like a cloud.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.502

13:55.543 --> 13:57.879
but now we have to make
a decision.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.506
- This is gonna
be really hard.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.007
- Could have used
a little more fondant,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.593
but we'll talk
about that later.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.554
We're staring down the barrel
of biscuit versus biscuit.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.015
- And it's anyone's game.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.725
- I'm not a betting man,
but if I were,

14:10.767 --> 14:13.603
I'd put my money on biscuits.

35:14.656 --> 35:17.409
- Yeah, I mean the bond
which we've shared with them

35:17.450 --> 35:19.327
over the past few days,
it's been amazing.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.662
- You know, it just showed.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.455
- They're like family for life.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.374
- But thank you.
This was beautiful.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.542
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

35:25.583 --> 35:26.960
- Thank you.

35:27.002 --> 35:28.878
<i>- Look at that.
-</i>

35:28.920 --> 35:33.008
<i>- We made a very special treat</i>

35:33.049 --> 35:36.469
for our two new friends,
Tom and Steve.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.096
- Yeah.

35:38.138 --> 35:41.474
- We know that Steve's
specialty is French pastries.

35:41.516 --> 35:44.728
And so we decided
to do a choux pastry

35:44.769 --> 35:48.189
with a vanilla bean
cream patisserie.

35:48.231 --> 35:51.109
And then we also did pistachio

35:51.151 --> 35:54.696
because we think of pistachio
as kind of a treat.

35:54.738 --> 35:57.490
These are just
kind of our fun little homage

35:57.532 --> 35:59.242
to our new friends.

35:59.284 --> 36:01.036
- This is
a little hard here.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.954
- Didn't knock my socks off,
but it tastes good.

36:02.996 --> 36:05.040
Don't get me wrong.
- Thank you.

36:05.081 --> 36:09.210
- The puddings? Tch.
Terrific, terrific.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.129
So I'm enjoying it very much.

36:11.171 --> 36:12.714
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:12.756 --> 36:15.675
- The filling
is just wonderful.

36:15.717 --> 36:17.635
The only thing I'm going to
ask you about

36:17.677 --> 36:19.596
is your choux--
for me, it's a bit tough.

36:19.637 --> 36:21.973
The coloring is
a little bit too dark

36:22.015 --> 36:26.436
and it's just a bit bready
on the outside.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.229
- How's it tasting there,
Tom and Steve?

36:28.271 --> 36:29.564
- It's delicious.

36:29.606 --> 36:32.317
The pastry cream
on the inside's unbelievable.

36:32.359 --> 36:33.651
- Thank you so much.

36:33.693 --> 36:35.570
It was such a treat
to see it taste this.

36:36.654 --> 36:37.864
- Thank you.

36:37.906 --> 36:40.075
<i>-
- Hello, grandmas.</i>

36:40.116 --> 36:41.868
<i>Hello.</i>

36:41.910 --> 36:43.411
<i>- So, around Christmas time,</i>

36:43.453 --> 36:45.038
Shawn and I enjoy candle-making

36:45.080 --> 36:46.998
among all the other
crazy things that we do.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.667
So that's what we wanted
to give

36:48.708 --> 36:50.919
our Secret Santa,
Jonah and Patrick.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.170
- Jonah and Patrick.
- Yeah.

36:54.381 --> 36:55.590
- We just wanted them
to know

36:55.632 --> 36:57.592
that we really, really
appreciate them

36:57.634 --> 36:58.927
being who they are

36:58.968 --> 37:01.930
and being outward
and brave about who they are.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.598
- So those are colors of pride,

37:03.640 --> 37:05.183
and that's what we wanted
to share with them.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.726
- Exactly.

37:06.768 --> 37:09.688
<i>The cake is in fact,
a lemon-flavored cake.</i>

37:09.729 --> 37:12.607
<i>Inside are fresh strawberries
and walnuts.</i>

37:12.649 --> 37:15.068
On the outside, you're gonna
have a buttercream

37:15.110 --> 37:17.904
that has a little bit
of a peppermint flavor.

37:17.946 --> 37:22.033
Just to remind us
of the holidays a little bit.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.703
- The icing could have been
just a little bit cleaner.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.121
You know I'm nitpicky.

37:26.162 --> 37:28.164
The details
are really important.

37:28.206 --> 37:30.834
- Yeah, no, no, no.
- We appreciate it.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.961
- It's not too moist.
It's not too dry.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.587
And you get just a hint
of peppermint,

37:34.629 --> 37:35.797
which is perfect.

37:35.839 --> 37:39.634
- Jonah and Patrick,
how does it taste?

37:39.676 --> 37:40.927
- Made with love.

37:40.969 --> 37:42.554
-
It's perfect.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.183
- Good job, gentlemen.

37:49.686 --> 37:52.063
- You know, I'm actually
a very good gift receiver.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.023
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.064 --> 37:54.607
- Well, here.
There you go.

37:54.649 --> 37:58.528
- Maya!

37:58.570 --> 38:00.655
Ah!

38:00.697 --> 38:02.032
- It's nothing.

38:02.073 --> 38:04.492
- It <i>is</i> nothing!
- Mm-hmm.

38:04.534 --> 38:06.494
- I love it.

38:06.536 --> 38:09.080
- Thank you.
- Where did you get this?

38:09.122 --> 38:11.291
- Nowhere.
- Is there a receipt?

38:11.332 --> 38:13.710
- There is a gift receipt.
- Okay, cool.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.552
- What's the best gift
you've ever given?

38:22.594 --> 38:25.930
- Ooh, gosh.
Um, life?

38:26.931 --> 38:29.559
- That's real.
Think about it.

38:29.601 --> 38:31.770
- What about you?
- I don't know.

38:31.811 --> 38:34.314
Probably just cash.
- Mm.

38:34.356 --> 38:39.110
Jessica and Stephanie,
please bring us your bake.

38:39.152 --> 38:41.529
Aww.

38:41.571 --> 38:44.074
- Give me a break.
That is so cute.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.867
- Look at that.
- Isn't that adorable?

38:45.909 --> 38:47.285
- So we made these
Secret Santas

38:47.327 --> 38:50.038
for our Secret Santa,
Sharon and Mike,

38:50.080 --> 38:51.998
because when they made
their cake,

38:52.040 --> 38:54.709
<i>they had that cute little elf
out of fondant</i>

38:54.751 --> 38:56.252
and we thought
he might be missing Santa.

38:56.294 --> 38:57.295
- Aww.

38:57.337 --> 38:58.588
- Aww.
- Thank you.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.590
- So religieuse is
a double-decker cream puff.

39:00.632 --> 39:03.051
It has
an orange creme diplomat

39:03.093 --> 39:04.386
that's made with chocolate.

39:04.427 --> 39:06.846
And then the hat is made
out of freeze-dried

39:06.888 --> 39:09.265
strawberry powder, sugar,
and cocoa butter.

39:09.307 --> 39:11.267
- So this is
strawberry chocolate?

39:11.309 --> 39:13.269
- Yeah.
- Look.

39:13.311 --> 39:16.606
- I think perfect.
- It looks good on you.

39:17.315 --> 39:22.028
- I was surprised how soft
it is, how light it is.

39:22.070 --> 39:24.698
- Well, y'all know
I'm all about the details.

39:24.739 --> 39:25.865
- Yes.

39:25.907 --> 39:28.660
- The piping
on the Santa Claus.

39:28.702 --> 39:30.620
Maybe if you have used
a smaller tip,

39:30.662 --> 39:31.663
you could see the detail more.

39:31.705 --> 39:34.124
- Yeah.
- But overall, very good.

39:34.165 --> 39:35.834
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:35.875 --> 39:39.629
- Well, girls, you will not see
this very often,

39:39.671 --> 39:40.880
but you get two snaps up

39:40.922 --> 39:43.091
and a clap for more
on this one.

39:43.133 --> 39:46.219
And I save that
for very special recipes.

39:46.261 --> 39:48.638
This is so yummy.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.098
- Oh, thank you.
- Wow. Thank you.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.975
- Mike and Sharon,
how does it taste?

39:52.017 --> 39:54.602
- It's very good.
- It's very good.

39:54.644 --> 39:56.813
- Do you think
it should win?

40:00.233 --> 40:02.027
- Jonah and Patrick?
- Wow.

40:02.068 --> 40:04.029
<i>- So what we are putting
in front of you</i>

40:04.070 --> 40:05.780
<i>is Spanish lemon meringue
bites.</i>

40:05.822 --> 40:07.032
- Oh, wow.

40:07.073 --> 40:09.868
- Our Secret Santa
is Abhi and Niyati.

40:09.909 --> 40:12.829
- And we wanted to hopefully
give them something

40:12.871 --> 40:15.331
that pays respect
for their taste.

40:15.373 --> 40:19.002
Food historians think that
lemons originated from India.

40:19.044 --> 40:21.463
Also the candied peels
on the top,

40:21.504 --> 40:24.507
we cooked them
in wild blueberry sugar...

40:24.549 --> 40:26.801
- Wild blueberry sugar?

40:26.843 --> 40:29.971
- Because we wanted to give you
something somewhat familiar,

40:30.013 --> 40:31.765
but something
a little different.

40:31.806 --> 40:34.392
- Looking at it.
It's not the prettiest.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.895
- Yeah.
- Just some little details,

40:36.936 --> 40:39.189
but I'm telling you,
it's really tasty.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.774
- Thank you.
- I have to say

40:40.815 --> 40:42.609
it's very hard to do
lemon meringue pie

40:42.650 --> 40:45.945
because getting that balance
is really a difficult thing.

40:45.987 --> 40:47.739
<i>To make it sweet and yet get</i>

40:47.781 --> 40:50.367
<i>that little bit
of tartness as well.</i>

40:50.408 --> 40:54.329
And I think you guys did
a brilliant job of doing that.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.289
This is delicious.

40:56.331 --> 40:58.124
- It's great,
and I think it was

40:58.166 --> 40:59.709
a perfect thing that you made.

40:59.751 --> 41:00.794
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

41:00.835 --> 41:02.921

how does it taste?

41:02.962 --> 41:04.547
- Amazing.
- Amazing, very delish.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.424

the best gift?

of Secret Santa,
