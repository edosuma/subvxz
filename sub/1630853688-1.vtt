01:22.650 --> 01:23.818

02:09.296 --> 02:10.932
WOMAN:
Thank you, Barbara.

02:10.965 --> 02:15.536
So let's turn to our West Coast
expansion plans.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.270
The acquisition of...

02:17.304 --> 02:18.573
You've got a call.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.508
Okay, can you take a message?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.844
Apparently, it's urgent.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.613
You've got in front of you
a breakdown of the practices,

02:25.647 --> 02:27.180
practice areas and annual i--

02:27.214 --> 02:29.951
( people continue chattering
indistinctly )

02:29.984 --> 02:31.753
Thank you.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.789
Cole Baird.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.659
WOMAN:
Talk to us about their
environmental practice.

02:37.692 --> 02:40.628
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

03:04.986 --> 03:06.754
You're crazy.

03:06.788 --> 03:08.956
Have you talked to your dad
about your plans?

03:08.990 --> 03:11.258
No. I'm probably gonna do it
tonight.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.660
What do you think
he'll say?

03:12.694 --> 03:14.294
I dunno.
Same as he always says.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.396
Yeah.
What about you?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.231
Expectin' to hear
this week.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.701
I can't believe
they're lettin' you coach

03:19.734 --> 03:20.935
the girls' basketball team.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.538
Assistant coach.
And why not?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.940
Well, you were a lousy
point guard, for starters.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.775
And you nearly lost us
the championship.

03:27.809 --> 03:30.310
Okay, the way I see it,
I was the one

03:30.343 --> 03:31.713
who got us there
in the first place.

03:31.746 --> 03:33.681
And what exactly
did you contribute

03:33.715 --> 03:35.550
to Kent County High?

03:35.583 --> 03:36.984
Well, my good looks and charm,
of course.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.285
Yeah right.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.453
( chuckles )

03:41.488 --> 03:43.891
Hey, my dad said he was goin'
to the bank this afternoon.

03:43.925 --> 03:46.794
So maybe I'll just walk with you

03:46.828 --> 03:48.696
and I'll catch a ride
back later with him.

03:48.730 --> 03:51.799
Yeah. Uh, my dad's workin' late,
so it should be fine.

03:54.836 --> 03:56.738
Okay.

03:56.771 --> 03:58.539
I'll, uh--
I'll see you boys tomorrow.

03:58.573 --> 03:59.941
All right.
I'll call you.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.677
( mockingly ):
I'll call you. I'll call you.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.245
I'll call you.
I'll call--

04:07.915 --> 04:09.050
( bell dings )

04:09.083 --> 04:10.551
Order up.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.489
Señor Cabbage! What's up,
college boy? How are you?

04:15.523 --> 04:17.658
No mucho. And I'm not
a college boy just yet!

04:17.692 --> 04:19.694
Come on.
Where's your little brother at?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.596
That little shit is home sick.

04:21.629 --> 04:22.864
All right, tell him
I say get better.

04:22.897 --> 04:24.264
Oh, yeah.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.769
Why do they call you that?

04:27.802 --> 04:29.003
What?
Cabbage.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.907
"Cole" in Spanish
means "cabbage."

04:34.509 --> 04:35.710
Really?
Yup.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.310
( laughs )

04:37.344 --> 04:38.913
Something funny?

04:38.946 --> 04:42.583
Yeah, that's funny. That's--
I'm-- I'm keepin' that.

04:42.617 --> 04:43.751
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:43.785 --> 04:44.919
If you know what's good for you,

04:44.952 --> 04:46.319
you'll forget
you ever heard that.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.789
No, I don't think so.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.092
The usual?

04:51.125 --> 04:55.062
Oh, Florrie, I think
I'm in love with you.

04:55.096 --> 04:57.999
Ah, you say that
to all the pretty girls.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.734
( chuckles )

04:59.767 --> 05:03.604
You big shots ever gonna
order any food in here?

05:03.638 --> 05:05.506
Just sodas.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.841
Big spenders.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.409
( chuckles )
Thank you.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.377
Love you.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.751
Just give me another minute
for the asparagus.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.619
Can you stand--?
Hey! Don't you dare!

05:18.653 --> 05:19.821
Come on!
Really?

05:21.122 --> 05:22.557
( laughs )

05:22.590 --> 05:24.725
Hats off at the table, son.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.695
( clock chiming )

05:35.069 --> 05:36.938
Hey, I, uh--
I went with Jack and Elle

05:36.971 --> 05:39.106
down to the fairgrounds
to watch them set up.

05:39.140 --> 05:40.808
Mm-hm.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.480
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

05:47.515 --> 05:48.816
Uh, Mr. Miller was saying

05:48.850 --> 05:50.852
with the dry weather
in the Midwest this spring,

05:50.885 --> 05:52.887
he's gonna get top dollar
for his crop.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.523
Is that so?
Yeah.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, the next four years

05:58.693 --> 06:01.494
are gonna be an important time
in your life, Cole.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.001
College Park'll
expand your horizons.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.974
Jack and I were talking about
how weird it's gonna be

06:13.007 --> 06:14.809
to live in different towns.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.979
I think I've seen him
every day of my life.

06:18.012 --> 06:19.714
Yeah.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.550
It's all right.
I'll be back in no time.

06:24.719 --> 06:27.555
Hey, so I've been thinking more
about that Ag major...

06:27.588 --> 06:28.956
Cole, I don't wanna
discuss this again.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.892
If you want to take
a few courses, that's fine--

06:30.925 --> 06:32.860
But I think you need
to find a major

06:32.894 --> 06:34.962
that will give you
more options.

06:36.631 --> 06:38.833
There's nothing wrong
with a farmer's life.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.434
I mean, my family always had
food on the table,

06:41.468 --> 06:44.739
even if your grandpa
had to pick it himself.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.845
You've got promise, son.
I've seen it.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.048
Take your time.

06:57.184 --> 07:01.822
Well, you've got four years
to figure it out.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.128
Well, I guess I'm gonna need
a new kitchen assistant

07:07.161 --> 07:09.730
in the next couple of months.
( chuckles ) Yeah.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.632
Or maybe it's time
for you and dad

07:11.666 --> 07:13.601
to finally splurge
on a new dishwasher.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.003
Yeah, "splurge"
is not exactly a word

07:16.037 --> 07:17.705
I would associate
with your father.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.540
( chuckles )

07:19.573 --> 07:20.841
I guess it's gonna be
kinda tough

07:20.875 --> 07:22.209
for you and Elle this fall.

07:22.243 --> 07:26.180
Oh, my God, Mom.
It's all I'm thinking about.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.083
I just wish I could
take her with me.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.152
Maybe she could move
into my dorm.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.220
Oh. Nice try.

07:33.254 --> 07:35.256
( laughing ):
Really...

07:35.289 --> 07:36.791
Seriously, I just--

07:36.824 --> 07:40.061
I wanna get through college,
get back here...

07:40.094 --> 07:41.896
to Elle, to Galena,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.597
all of it...

07:50.137 --> 07:52.707
You all right, Mom?
You look kinda tired.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.910
Yeah, I feel a little tired.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.678
You know,
I don't have much energy.

07:57.712 --> 07:59.847
I probably just need to go
to bed a lot earlier.

08:15.963 --> 08:19.000
Let's build a house right here.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.668
Hmm.

08:20.701 --> 08:24.572
I think Stapleton might have
somethin' to say about that.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.207
Oh, that old bird.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.275
He doesn't need
this piece of dirt.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.581
Okay, done.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.016
Even better, when I get back,

08:35.049 --> 08:36.317
I'll just buy the old shit out

08:36.350 --> 08:38.552
and kick him off the farm
altogether.

08:43.691 --> 08:47.928
Elle, I know what I'm gonna do
tomorrow, and the next day...

08:47.962 --> 08:49.096
I'm gonna go to college.

08:49.130 --> 08:50.631
And I'm gonna see
what they know,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.166
then I'm gonna come back
and shake this place up.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.101
I'm gonna show them
how it's really done!

08:54.135 --> 08:58.239
I'll run Stapleton's place and
earn ten times what he makes.

08:58.272 --> 08:59.874
( chuckles softly )

08:59.907 --> 09:01.742
I love everything about you.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.749
You...are amazing.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.123
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

09:21.162 --> 09:22.696
JACK:
My mom wants to know

09:22.730 --> 09:24.999
if you wanna work for us again
this summer.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.668
Yeah, I'd love to.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.839
Yeah?
I need to check
with my dad, though.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.207
He wants me to work with him
at the bank

09:33.240 --> 09:34.942
until I leave for school.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.045
My dad's movin' slow.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.780
Thinks this'll be
his last season.

09:39.814 --> 09:42.383
He's just plain worn out, man.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.618
We're already behind.

09:51.192 --> 09:53.227
Yeah, you know what?
I'll help,

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
even if I have to work
at the bank.

09:55.296 --> 09:57.198
Yeah?

09:57.231 --> 09:58.966
Seriously, yeah.
Tell your mom I'll help out.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.901
Okay.
I'd rather be outside anyway.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.069
Thanks, man.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.639
All right,
I gotta pick up Elle at 8--

10:05.673 --> 10:07.141
We'll meet you
at the fairgrounds at 9.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.243
Yeah, sounds good.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.079
Hey! What'd your dad say
about Ag?

10:12.113 --> 10:14.315
Take a wild guess!

10:14.348 --> 10:16.117
Later, man.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.754
( carnival music playing )

10:24.258 --> 10:26.760
( chattering indistinctly )

10:29.363 --> 10:33.134
Well, well. The young lady
steps to the free-throw line.

10:33.167 --> 10:35.736
COLE:
All right.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
Thank you, sir.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.973
Let's see what you got.
And don't forget:

10:39.006 --> 10:41.342
Assistant coach.
( scoffs )

10:41.375 --> 10:44.145
Good enough to kick your sorry
ass, "Cabbage Boy."

10:45.446 --> 10:46.847
Don't get mad.

10:46.881 --> 10:48.816
( bell ringing )
Oh!

10:48.849 --> 10:50.651
We have a winner!
What?!

10:52.753 --> 10:54.054
Here you go, young lady.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.756
Thank you.
Oh, look at that.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.224
So cute.

10:57.258 --> 10:59.760
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

10:59.793 --> 11:02.663
( chattering indistinctly )

11:33.528 --> 11:35.896
Hey. You're leaving early.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.731
Yeah, I'm headed to Jack's.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.067
Um, I'm gonna be late tomorrow
too. The big tractor's down,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.002
so we've gotta prep the lower
field with the two Masseys.

11:42.036 --> 11:44.038
I know they need help,
with Tom winding down.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.774
But you've got
responsibilities here, Cole.

11:48.510 --> 11:51.946
Okay. Got it, Dad.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.847
Dinner at 6!

11:55.916 --> 11:58.285
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

13:03.050 --> 13:04.485
Hey.

13:04.519 --> 13:06.521
Good to go?
Yeah, uh, give me a sec.

13:06.554 --> 13:07.921
Yeah, yeah.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.861
Did you have that meeting
with your advisor yet?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.029
Yeah, I had it this morning.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.096
How'd it go?

13:16.130 --> 13:17.865
He said
I'm short four credits.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.199
I should've never
switched majors.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.434
I'm gonna have to take
two classes

13:20.467 --> 13:22.069
this summer
after graduation.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.571
You goin' to the game tonight?
Yeah, you?

13:23.605 --> 13:24.606
Yeah, I'm just gonna be late.

13:24.639 --> 13:26.073
I got class at 6:10.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.108
Will you grab me a ticket?
Will do.

13:30.044 --> 13:32.146
You know I'm hoping to get
that internship

13:32.179 --> 13:34.381
at the new Agricon research farm
in Easton this fall...

13:34.415 --> 13:36.050
so then I am back for good.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.852
I know.

13:38.886 --> 13:42.122
Hey, it'll go by in a flash.
You'll see.

13:42.156 --> 13:46.093
Um... Look, I gotta go.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.963
But um, I'll give you
a call next week.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.865
I love you.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.370
Hey.
Hey.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.205
Everything okay?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.575
Yeah, um...

14:00.608 --> 14:02.443
Hey, I need to use your car
this weekend.

14:02.476 --> 14:03.444
I need to go see Elle.

14:03.477 --> 14:04.878
Yeah, of course.

14:04.912 --> 14:05.979

Of course.

Thanks.

Hey.

No problem.

All right.

Um, also, as I was leaving,
they scheduled

14:39.046 --> 14:41.281
an athletic department meeting
tonight for 7.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.118
Wanna just go to Florrie's
and kill a few hours?

14:44.151 --> 14:46.420
Are you sure?
Yeah.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.322
I'm happy to help.
It's no problem.

Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.091
Cool. Okay.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.529
( starts engine )

15:00.267 --> 15:02.102
I'm proud of you, you know.

15:02.136 --> 15:04.639
So's your father.
Thanks, Mom.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.711
From the time you were born,

15:09.744 --> 15:12.212
he talked about turning
this farm over to you--

15:12.246 --> 15:14.014
Just like his father
did for him.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.251
Well, I hope I can pull it off.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.486
You're already doing it.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.692
Oh, uh, Elle called.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.961
She said to pick her up at 7.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.030
Got it.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.733
You two gettin' serious?

15:31.766 --> 15:34.602
Come on, Mom.
She's Cole's girlfriend.

15:34.636 --> 15:37.672
Cole's been gone a long time.

15:45.513 --> 15:48.315

( knocking )

16:02.296 --> 16:03.997
( doorbell rings )

16:04.031 --> 16:05.399
Coming!

16:09.436 --> 16:11.338
Surprise!

16:11.371 --> 16:14.141
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

16:14.174 --> 16:18.078
Well, I'm taking my girlfriend
out on a Saturday. What else?

16:27.054 --> 16:30.658
Jack! What's up, man?
What brings you by?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.261
Hey man, I didn't know
you were back in town.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.397
Yeah, it's just
a quick visit.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.333
Where are you headed
all dressed up?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.671
Oh, um...

16:43.705 --> 16:45.205
We were just checkin' out
a movie

16:45.239 --> 16:47.241
with some folks
this afternoon.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.209
Oh.

16:49.243 --> 16:52.412
I'm sorry, man,
she's all mine!

16:52.446 --> 16:54.147
I'm sorry, Jack.

16:56.584 --> 17:00.120
You guys have a great time.
It's good to see you, Cole.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.488
COLE:
See ya, Jack.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.659
Got you these.

17:04.692 --> 17:06.226
ELLE:
Thanks.

17:10.632 --> 17:12.165
Decided to surprise you.

17:23.678 --> 17:26.714
Hey, sorry to spoil
your plans with Jack.

17:26.748 --> 17:28.516
( scoffs )

17:28.550 --> 17:29.584
Don't be silly.

17:29.617 --> 17:32.185
We were just
going to the movies.

17:34.589 --> 17:35.790
You sure?

17:38.458 --> 17:41.295
Cole, don't do that.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.367
Jack.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.372
Jack!

18:02.416 --> 18:03.751
Hey man.

18:05.553 --> 18:06.688
You headin' back?

18:06.721 --> 18:08.756
Yeah,
I'm on my way back now.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.792
What brings you by?

18:10.825 --> 18:13.193
What movie were you
going to see last night?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.295
What?

18:15.329 --> 18:17.865
You said you were meetin' people
at the movies. What movie?

18:17.899 --> 18:20.334
I dunno. Whatever's playin'
at the Bellevue.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.736
Who else were you meeting?

18:21.769 --> 18:24.304
Just some folks.

18:24.338 --> 18:26.373
I'm coming back, Jack.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.342
Okay.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.711
What's your point?

18:30.912 --> 18:32.747
Just don't forget it.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.320
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

18:54.902 --> 18:56.938
How was the bank today?

18:56.971 --> 18:58.506
Fine.

19:07.749 --> 19:10.652
Oh, Cole--
Cole's comin' home

19:10.685 --> 19:12.587
for Christmas break Tuesday.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.921
( chuckles )

19:13.955 --> 19:15.590
Okay.

19:19.961 --> 19:22.530
Teresa, you have to tell him.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.236
No.

19:31.606 --> 19:33.875
I don't want him to worry.

19:33.908 --> 19:36.276
I'm not gonna do that
to him.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.246
Either way, he'll know
when you start chemo.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.882
Well...

19:42.717 --> 19:45.218
Maybe I won't do it.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.788
( silverware clatters )

19:46.821 --> 19:48.723
Well, that's a death sentence,
isn't it?

19:48.756 --> 19:49.757
Is that what you want?

19:49.791 --> 19:51.659
( silverware clatters )

20:07.441 --> 20:09.577
No, I don't.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.951
COLE:
Well, I figured it'll give me
a head start

20:16.984 --> 20:18.853
before Stapleton
finally sells his place--

20:18.886 --> 20:20.287
That's the one
I really want.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.289
Thought you were
going to law school?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.591
College boy.
Yeah, okay.

20:23.624 --> 20:24.759
You can laugh all you want,

20:24.792 --> 20:26.426
but I'm gonna be in the market.
Yeah.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.862
And as for money,
I think you forget

20:27.895 --> 20:29.496
I have an in
with a local banker.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.033
Not if it's the same
local banker I know.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.001
Do you two ever stop?

20:39.540 --> 20:42.442
Look, is there somethin'
goin' on I should know about?

20:45.613 --> 20:46.614
Jack?

20:51.986 --> 20:54.021
Stop it! Stop it!

20:54.055 --> 20:56.557
Guys, stop it!
( cars honking )

20:59.392 --> 21:01.028
Seriously?! Jack?
What?

21:01.062 --> 21:02.930
No, you, of all people?

21:02.964 --> 21:04.331
Really?

21:08.936 --> 21:10.571
You know what, Elle,

21:10.605 --> 21:12.540
I really thought
we were gonna be somethin'.

21:21.716 --> 21:23.483
Hey.
Hey.

21:24.786 --> 21:26.486
Everything okay?

21:26.521 --> 21:28.523
Yeah, it's fine.

21:29.924 --> 21:31.526
( sighs )

21:40.902 --> 21:42.003
Hey Cole...

21:44.939 --> 21:48.876
There's something, uh,
I need--

21:48.910 --> 21:51.045
I need to tell you.

21:53.147 --> 21:56.383
Okay. What is it?

21:58.385 --> 22:00.420
Um, heh...

22:07.061 --> 22:12.967
I-I haven't been,
uh, feelin' so great lately.

22:14.902 --> 22:15.970
What do you mean?

22:17.738 --> 22:19.406
I've been to see a doctor...

22:26.514 --> 22:28.749
and, uh...

22:28.783 --> 22:31.986
And I have some cancer.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.453
Mom. What?

22:33.486 --> 22:35.923
I-- Please don't worry. Okay?

22:35.957 --> 22:37.758
Okay. What-What kind of cancer?

22:37.792 --> 22:38.926
I--

22:38.960 --> 22:41.629
It's a lung cancer,
but it's slow.

22:41.662 --> 22:46.167
And we've known
a little while now.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.769
Mom, I--

22:48.803 --> 22:51.404
I'm seeing a really good doctor.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.542
He's got a plan.
Everything's going to be fine.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.743
Okay.

22:55.776 --> 22:57.178
What are the next steps?

22:57.211 --> 22:58.746
Are you gonna go
to the hospital?

22:58.779 --> 22:59.981
Are they gonna operate?

23:00.014 --> 23:03.084
I'm gonna get chemo.
We've been saving up.

23:03.117 --> 23:06.153
Saving up? Wait, how long have
you known about this?

23:06.187 --> 23:09.690
About a year.

23:09.724 --> 23:11.659
You've waited a year! What?

23:11.692 --> 23:13.895
Our insurance wasn't enough.

23:13.928 --> 23:15.529
And we didn't
have enough money then.

23:15.563 --> 23:17.698
But now we do now...
No, Mom, you had money.

23:17.732 --> 23:19.200
You paid my tuition.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.103
See, this is why
I didn't tell you.

23:22.136 --> 23:24.739
Okay? I just--
I don't want you to worry.

23:24.772 --> 23:26.473
You gotta focus
on your classes.

23:26.507 --> 23:28.776
Okay, so you're telling me
Dad spent all our money

23:28.809 --> 23:30.111
on the University of Maryland

23:30.144 --> 23:31.145
while you've been
getting sicker?

23:31.178 --> 23:32.813
What the hell was he thinking!

23:32.847 --> 23:34.447
No, listen to me.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.816
Honey...

23:35.850 --> 23:37.051
( sniffles )

23:40.721 --> 23:42.823
I'm gonna be okay.

23:42.857 --> 23:44.792
And so are you.

23:46.527 --> 23:48.029
Okay? Come on.

23:50.965 --> 23:53.500
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

Hey.

Quite the game, coach.
Thanks!

24:14.655 --> 24:16.991
Um, let's, uh-- Let's go out.

24:17.024 --> 24:18.993
Okay.
Where should we go?

24:19.026 --> 24:20.661
Uh, you name it.

24:21.896 --> 24:25.199
( <i>romantic theme playing</i> )

24:41.115 --> 24:44.484
Um...
You wanna go to the movies?

24:50.691 --> 24:52.693
Sure.

24:52.727 --> 24:53.894
Come on.

24:58.299 --> 25:00.735
So you got the word today?

25:00.768 --> 25:02.636
Yes, I'm so pumped!

25:02.670 --> 25:04.605
Sounds grim to me--

25:04.638 --> 25:06.907
Pushing a plow at Agricon

25:06.941 --> 25:09.577
in suburban Easton isn't exactly
what I'd call heaven.

25:09.610 --> 25:13.114
First of all, nobody's "pushed
a plow" in about 75 years.

25:13.147 --> 25:15.850
Second, you don't appreciate
the simple things in life.

25:15.883 --> 25:17.885
If mud-covered overalls
at 5 a.m.

25:17.918 --> 25:19.286
is one of the simpler things--

25:19.320 --> 25:21.789
You're right,
I don't appreciate them.

25:21.822 --> 25:23.124
But if you're happy,
I'm happy.

25:23.157 --> 25:24.959
Thank you.
Oh, I gotta go.

25:24.992 --> 25:28.095
I'm meeting Melissa
at the lounge.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.932
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
Who's Melissa?

25:31.966 --> 25:33.601
I thought you were dating
that girl from Cleveland.

25:33.634 --> 25:34.635
What was her name?
Maureen.

25:34.668 --> 25:35.903
No, that didn't work out.

25:35.936 --> 25:37.638
I don't think
she fully appreciated

25:37.671 --> 25:39.940
how lucky she was to have me.

25:39.974 --> 25:42.543
There it is. All right.
Get outta here.

<i>Congratulations!</i>

25:59.160 --> 26:01.796

from Georgetown.

Wow. Um...

26:16.911 --> 26:19.013
Your mother wants
to talk to you.

26:19.046 --> 26:21.315
He already heard.

to call you all day.

Did they call you, or...?

No, I...
Uh, I actually didn't know.

talking about something else.

Honey, are you okay?
You sound kinda funny.

26:40.367 --> 26:43.704
Yeah. I'm fine. Uh...

I'm just excited, that's all.

<i>honey.</i>

26:48.175 --> 26:51.045
All right,
I'll talk to you later, Mom.

It's okay. It's okay.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.342
Shoot, I just got water
everywhere.

27:55.376 --> 27:56.944
No, seriously--
It's on your shoes.

27:56.977 --> 27:59.480
No, please, please.
Really, it's fine.

27:59.514 --> 28:01.448
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's just water.

28:01.482 --> 28:04.018
Can I put, like,
a towel down...?

28:04.051 --> 28:06.253
No. I'm fine. I'm fine. Really.

Oh!

I know--

28:20.535 --> 28:23.370
I mean, I know who you are.

28:23.404 --> 28:26.508
I've been watching you around,
so...

28:26.541 --> 28:29.310
Not, um, watching you...

28:29.343 --> 28:31.245
because that's
incredibly creepy.

28:31.278 --> 28:32.246
Yeah.
Um...

28:32.279 --> 28:34.782
We-we've met before.

We were in Securities
Regulations together.

So Eastern Shore?

29:33.307 --> 29:34.908
I mean, isn't that redundant,

29:34.942 --> 29:36.511
considering the Atlantic Ocean?

29:36.544 --> 29:39.313
Seems unlikely that Maryland
would have a Western Shore.

29:39.346 --> 29:41.849
No, it's the Eastern Shore
of the Chesapeake Bay,

29:41.882 --> 29:43.284
not the Atlantic Ocean.

29:43.317 --> 29:45.520
It's the only place in the world
you can grow soybeans

29:45.553 --> 29:47.555
and pick blue crabs
at the same time.

29:47.589 --> 29:49.223
God, if you haven't seen

29:49.256 --> 29:51.058
the light hit off the wings
of snow geese in the winter,

29:51.091 --> 29:53.093
you haven't lived.

29:53.127 --> 29:54.562
Interesting.

29:54.596 --> 29:58.566
Um, and so do your parents
still live in Galena?

29:58.600 --> 30:00.367
They do. Yeah.

30:00.401 --> 30:02.570
My dad's been the manager of
Eastern Bank since I was a kid.

30:02.604 --> 30:04.506
Um, it's a small outfit,

30:04.539 --> 30:05.973
but they handle

30:06.006 --> 30:08.543
most of the local farmers'
business accounts.

30:08.576 --> 30:12.346
He must be the most
popular guy in town.
Yeah.

30:12.379 --> 30:15.149
When times are good,
and the weather holds,

30:15.182 --> 30:16.584
but when things get tough,

30:16.618 --> 30:18.185
whether it's drought, flood,

30:18.218 --> 30:20.321
anything that impacts
the harvest and cash flow,

30:20.354 --> 30:22.956
they tend to avoid
the local banker.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.559
So...

30:24.592 --> 30:28.362
My grandfather, my mom's dad,
he had a farm in Texas.

30:28.395 --> 30:30.164
He inherited it from his dad.

30:30.197 --> 30:32.099
He lost it in the '50s.

30:32.132 --> 30:34.068
There was a drought
that lasted seven years,

30:34.101 --> 30:36.136
if you can believe that.

30:36.170 --> 30:40.107
He finally found work in Galena,
farmed his own land on the side.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.142
Farming's been in my family
for a long time.

30:42.176 --> 30:44.211
You can tell.
( laughs )

30:44.244 --> 30:47.147
So I plan to go back to Galena
at some point.

30:47.181 --> 30:51.085
It's a hard time for my parents.
My mom's been sick.

30:51.118 --> 30:52.419
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:52.453 --> 30:54.556
That's okay. Thanks.

30:54.589 --> 30:58.092
She seems to be
battling through it.

30:58.125 --> 31:01.495
Um, so do you have friends
still out there?

31:01.529 --> 31:04.064
Yeah, my best friend
Jack Miller is there.

31:04.098 --> 31:06.166
He just took over
his dad's farm.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.570
And uh, just got engaged...

31:08.603 --> 31:11.472
to my old girlfriend.

31:11.506 --> 31:13.974
How about that? Yeah.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.176
Close friend, then, huh?

31:16.210 --> 31:19.113
Yeah, he is. It's--

31:19.146 --> 31:20.914
The three of us
grew up together.

31:20.948 --> 31:23.183
It's kinda complicated.

31:23.217 --> 31:25.986
But I get back there
as often as I can.

31:26.019 --> 31:29.289
So most everyone else
has moved on.

31:29.323 --> 31:30.692
Like you.
Hm.

31:30.725 --> 31:32.059
( both chuckle )

31:32.092 --> 31:34.261
Um...

31:34.294 --> 31:36.930
Hey, do you play tennis?

31:46.674 --> 31:48.710
So this is gonna be shocking,

31:48.743 --> 31:51.345
but I've never actually
played tennis before.

31:51.378 --> 31:53.414
Well, you look like a pro.

31:53.447 --> 31:55.015
Yes. Yeah, I thought
the same thing.

31:55.048 --> 31:56.350
Yeah. This is yours.

31:56.383 --> 31:57.418
This is mine?
Yup.

31:57.451 --> 31:58.686
Great. Thanks.
Ball.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.154
Yup.
Okay.

32:05.058 --> 32:06.460
Oh...

32:24.111 --> 32:26.413
Hey Florrie.
Hey honey.

32:29.751 --> 32:31.686
Just like old times.

32:31.719 --> 32:34.087
Don't tell me,
you're not hungry.

32:34.121 --> 32:36.524
No one pours Coca Cola
like you do, Florrie.

32:36.558 --> 32:38.593
You're still a charmer.

32:38.626 --> 32:40.695
( laughs )

32:42.095 --> 32:43.063
She looks great, huh?

32:43.096 --> 32:44.331
Yeah.

32:44.364 --> 32:46.266
How you doin'?

32:46.300 --> 32:48.603
It's good to see ya.
Yeah, what's up, Jack?

32:50.270 --> 32:53.106
Well, I was wondering
if you'd be my best man.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.309
You joking, right?

32:55.342 --> 32:57.177
You're my best friend, Cole.

32:57.211 --> 32:59.681
You're marrying my girlfriend.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.082
Look...

33:05.285 --> 33:09.557
I didn't set out to do this.
And neither did Elle.

33:09.591 --> 33:13.327
We didn't wanna--
We didn't wanna hurt you.

33:18.131 --> 33:20.768
I want to kill you right now.
You know that, right?

33:20.802 --> 33:22.402
I understand.

33:24.572 --> 33:27.107
You remember when we were kids,

33:27.140 --> 33:29.276
and you stole
my favorite matchbox car,

33:29.309 --> 33:30.745
that silver Mustang.

33:30.778 --> 33:33.313
You remember that?
Yeah.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.215
It took me a long time
to forgive you,

33:35.249 --> 33:37.652
and even then, I swore
I would never forget it.

33:37.685 --> 33:40.387
You had more than I did.

33:41.723 --> 33:43.457
Yeah, but that was the one
that I wanted.

33:48.696 --> 33:50.297
Fuck you, man.

34:06.648 --> 34:08.783
Yeah...

34:08.816 --> 34:11.318
Yeah, I'll be your best man.

34:17.892 --> 34:20.528
Bye.
Bye, honey.

34:29.537 --> 34:33.675
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

34:37.679 --> 34:39.313
Hey you!
Hi.

34:39.346 --> 34:41.415
What're you doing?
I thought we had class at noon.

34:41.448 --> 34:44.886
Lester canceled class because
of some conference he has.

34:44.919 --> 34:48.121
You made editor of law review--
It was just announced.

34:48.155 --> 34:50.223
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

34:50.257 --> 34:53.327
Uh, you have your interview
Jones McKinsey tomorrow, right?

34:53.360 --> 34:54.328
Yes, yeah.

34:54.361 --> 34:57.532
I do have something for you.

34:57.565 --> 34:59.834
Just a little luck tomorrow.

34:59.867 --> 35:02.302
What is this?

35:02.336 --> 35:05.506
Oh, my God. Sarah, this is--
This is way too much.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.774
You shouldn't have
got this.

35:06.808 --> 35:08.308
Oh, stop, it's my pleasure.

35:08.342 --> 35:09.777
Seriously.
This is way too nice.

35:09.811 --> 35:11.445
You deserve it.

35:11.478 --> 35:13.881
Thank you. Thank you.

35:13.915 --> 35:15.750
Great.
Now can we go celebrate?

35:15.783 --> 35:17.217
Yes.
Yes!

35:17.250 --> 35:18.720
Can you hold onto that for me?
Yeah.

35:26.928 --> 35:29.530
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

35:55.523 --> 35:56.724
( clears throat )

35:58.225 --> 35:59.894
Oh, Jack.

35:59.927 --> 36:01.663
Uh, have a seat, Jack.

36:01.696 --> 36:03.330
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Baird.

36:03.363 --> 36:04.732
Of course.

36:04.766 --> 36:07.535
Of course. Lookin' sharp.

36:07.568 --> 36:10.404
Thank you.
A little
surprised to get your call

36:10.437 --> 36:12.640
after the year you had
last year.

36:12.674 --> 36:14.642
Right. Yeah,
I know it's a bit of a stretch,

36:14.676 --> 36:16.644
but it's somethin'
Dad always wanted.

36:16.678 --> 36:18.946
I think it'll make
a fine investment.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.682
How is your father?

36:20.715 --> 36:22.617
Bored.
( chuckles )

36:23.751 --> 36:25.285
Mom likes Florida though.

36:25.318 --> 36:27.822
She's gettin' tan.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.289
She enjoys the beach.

36:29.322 --> 36:30.323
Jack...

36:32.760 --> 36:36.463
your father was very
conservative with his finances.

36:36.496 --> 36:38.398
Yes.

36:38.432 --> 36:42.269
So I ran the numbers
after we spoke.

36:42.302 --> 36:47.274
And while, yes, you do have
sufficient equity in your farm

36:47.307 --> 36:51.779
to raise a down payment
for the Marlin's land,

36:51.813 --> 36:54.481
um...

36:54.515 --> 36:57.250
you're taking on
a great deal of debt.

36:57.284 --> 36:59.587
Are you--
Are you ready to handle this?

36:59.620 --> 37:02.023
Yes, sir. I'm aware.
I can make it work.

37:02.056 --> 37:05.492
You understand
you're putting your home

37:05.526 --> 37:09.396
and your farm
on the line here?

37:09.429 --> 37:10.665
Yes, sir.

37:12.332 --> 37:16.303
Does Elle--?
My wife, sir.

37:19.741 --> 37:21.809
I'm doing this for my wife.

37:24.579 --> 37:25.747
For my kids,

37:25.780 --> 37:27.648
if I'm lucky enough to have 'em
one day.

37:27.682 --> 37:29.584
I-I-- You know, I--

37:31.085 --> 37:34.856
I want them to have
a better life than what I had.

37:37.592 --> 37:41.428
I think it's time for the men
in this family to step up.

37:41.461 --> 37:43.497
Do more than just hope.

37:50.538 --> 37:54.709
I'll have those loan documents
drawn up.

37:54.742 --> 37:57.879
You fill them out
and drop them off tomorrow.

37:57.912 --> 38:00.715
And we'll have an answer
for you next week.

38:00.748 --> 38:03.651
Yeah? Oh... All right.

38:03.684 --> 38:05.019
Yeah, I'll get 'em to ya.

38:07.688 --> 38:10.992
Thank you, Mr. Baird.
I'm not gonna let you down.

38:12.359 --> 38:15.062
Next time, wear a tie.
( chuckles )

38:15.096 --> 38:16.597
All right.

38:21.936 --> 38:24.872
( <i>pensive theme playing</i> )

38:35.516 --> 38:37.450
COLE:
Doctor of law.

38:37.484 --> 38:39.887
Doctor of-- Ha, ha.

38:39.921 --> 38:41.689
Oh, doc.

38:41.722 --> 38:43.490
We're so proud of you,
honey.

38:43.524 --> 38:44.625
Thanks, Mom.

38:46.093 --> 38:47.460
Hi.
Hi, Sarah!

38:47.494 --> 38:48.996
Hey, congratulations.

38:49.030 --> 38:52.633
Now there's a woman
who will take you places.

38:52.667 --> 38:55.036
So, what do you think
of your new attorney son?

38:55.069 --> 38:56.671
Oh, we couldn't be happier.

38:56.704 --> 38:59.607
A Georgetown Law degree,
a beautiful fiancée...

38:59.640 --> 39:01.642
What more could a man want?

39:01.676 --> 39:03.678
Such a shame your folks
couldn't be here.

39:03.711 --> 39:04.846
I know. It's okay.

39:04.879 --> 39:06.848
My father is in the midst
of a trial.

39:06.881 --> 39:09.951
I'll see them next week,
and we're gonna celebrate then.

39:09.984 --> 39:12.385
Oh, nice.
Are you gonna fly to California?

39:12.419 --> 39:15.556
She's gonna take a month off
on the West Coast

39:15.590 --> 39:18.059
and then we're gonna start
preparing for the Bar Exam.

39:18.092 --> 39:19.760
Are you gonna
go out with her?

39:19.794 --> 39:20.995
No. I'm gonna help Jack

39:21.028 --> 39:22.663
prep the new acreage
from Stapleton's.

39:22.697 --> 39:24.464
Don't waste your time
on that.

39:24.497 --> 39:26.868
Just focus on the exam.
( chuckles )

39:26.901 --> 39:29.570
Oh, John, it's okay.
Give the boy a break.

39:29.604 --> 39:30.905
I just need some time off.

39:30.938 --> 39:32.607
Life is gonna get
hectic this fall.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.543
And I was thinking
of driving with him to Jack's

39:35.576 --> 39:37.545
and then I'll fly out
on Monday morning.

39:37.578 --> 39:39.080
No, we can drive him.

39:39.113 --> 39:41.115
There's no need for you to take
him so far out of your way.

39:41.148 --> 39:42.650
Oh, it's okay.

39:42.683 --> 39:44.585
I wanna see
what all the fuss is about.

39:44.619 --> 39:46.621
All I ever hear
is about this farm.

39:46.654 --> 39:50.558
We can't drive past a
neighborhood vegetable garden

39:50.591 --> 39:51.959
without him giving me

39:51.993 --> 39:54.061
a 30-minute dissertation
on irrigation.

39:54.095 --> 39:56.030
COLE: That sounds about right.
SARAH: Yeah.

39:56.063 --> 39:58.966
Are you gonna join up with
father's firm when you get back?

39:59.000 --> 40:02.103
Eventually, but not at first,
it's too political.

40:02.136 --> 40:04.005
I want to earn
my position there.

40:04.038 --> 40:05.539
Well, lunch.

40:05.573 --> 40:06.574
Yeah, yeah.
Yes!

40:06.607 --> 40:08.509
We can do with a little lunch.

40:08.542 --> 40:09.911
That guy talked forever.

40:09.944 --> 40:11.112
( laughs )

40:16.918 --> 40:18.185
All right.

40:18.219 --> 40:19.987
Hold on. Stop. Stop. Wait.

40:29.196 --> 40:30.898
Shit.

40:30.932 --> 40:32.199
Wow.

40:32.233 --> 40:33.701
Looks like you blew a circuit.

40:33.734 --> 40:35.970
Uh-huh.
Nice.

40:40.041 --> 40:41.709
Careful.

40:41.742 --> 40:43.978
Thing's a hundred years old
at least.

40:44.011 --> 40:45.579
You're gonna wanna
get a heavy-up

40:45.613 --> 40:46.814
before somebody gets zapped.

40:46.847 --> 40:48.582
Yeah. It's on the list.

40:50.217 --> 40:53.154
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

40:55.289 --> 40:56.924
( faucet running )

41:12.139 --> 41:13.975
Oh, you're back early.

41:14.008 --> 41:15.609
I forgot to call the firm.

41:19.213 --> 41:20.881
Is that what I think it is?

41:20.915 --> 41:23.818
It's my favorite.
I know.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.754
( sighs )

41:33.294 --> 41:37.932
Um, so are things going well
for you guys?

41:37.965 --> 41:39.934
Why do you ask?

41:41.202 --> 41:42.837
I mean...

41:42.870 --> 41:45.172
I can't believe y'all
bought Stapleton's place.

41:45.206 --> 41:47.875
Ugh. He, um...

41:47.908 --> 41:49.710
He did it without telling me.

41:49.744 --> 41:53.714
I'm don't know what he was
thinking, actually.

41:55.082 --> 41:58.152
It's been a hard
couple of years.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.188
Things were already tight
after a few bad seasons.

42:09.096 --> 42:10.931
I'm worried.

42:10.965 --> 42:15.870
His behavior's becoming
a little...erratic.

42:15.903 --> 42:17.772
What do you mean?

42:17.805 --> 42:20.908
The business side
of running this place.

42:20.941 --> 42:22.143
It's hard for him.

42:22.176 --> 42:24.779
And he won't ask
for advice or help.

42:24.812 --> 42:26.614
He won't listen to me.

42:26.647 --> 42:28.015
He said with others selling out,

42:28.049 --> 42:29.884
it was time for us
to double down.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.952
( scoffs )
Yeah, well, that was a mistake.

42:31.986 --> 42:35.356
Of course it was mistake!
But what was I supposed to do?

42:35.389 --> 42:37.725
The whole thing
scares the crap out of me.

42:37.758 --> 42:40.294
I'm coaching five days a week,

42:40.327 --> 42:42.863
but there's no way
I can support us alone

42:42.897 --> 42:44.198
if this whole thing
goes to shit.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.734
Hey, I'm gonna help when I can.

42:46.767 --> 42:48.235
Okay?

42:48.269 --> 42:50.771
Hopefully, I can talk some sense
into him while I'm here.

42:50.805 --> 42:51.739
It's gonna be okay.

42:52.907 --> 42:54.909
While you're here.

42:54.942 --> 42:56.977
The story of your life.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.915
What is that supposed to mean?

43:04.018 --> 43:05.686
Look, I-I never planned

43:05.719 --> 43:08.722
for things to end up
the way that they did.

43:08.756 --> 43:10.991
Don't talk to me
about plans.

43:11.025 --> 43:12.359
You made your choices,

43:12.393 --> 43:13.994
which seemed to work out
pretty well.

43:14.028 --> 43:15.830
No, no. Hold on.

43:15.863 --> 43:18.332
Let's get something straight.
You're the one who ended it.

43:18.365 --> 43:21.068
I was busting my ass,
pulling a double major,

43:21.102 --> 43:22.736
and you snuggled up
with my best friend.

43:22.770 --> 43:24.071
So don't act like
it's my fault.

43:24.105 --> 43:25.673
You were never here!

43:25.706 --> 43:27.241
The campus was less
than two hours away.

43:27.274 --> 43:29.743
Highway goes both directions.
You always had excuses.

43:29.777 --> 43:32.379
You could have made
more of an effort yourself.

43:34.381 --> 43:36.283
Jesus Christ!

43:38.752 --> 43:40.221
I--

43:42.756 --> 43:44.658
Look, I--

43:46.093 --> 43:49.997
I've just got a lot
on my plate right now.

43:50.030 --> 43:51.999
I'm sorry.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.970
I know you're here to help,
and I appreciate it.

43:56.003 --> 43:57.071
( scoffs )

44:02.343 --> 44:04.145
You, um...

44:06.947 --> 44:09.350
You never told me anything
about the wedding plans.

44:11.485 --> 44:14.355
Sarah's in charge of all that,
so...

44:19.360 --> 44:22.029
All right, I need
to make this call.

44:22.062 --> 44:23.464
Can I use the phone?

44:23.497 --> 44:26.433
Of course.
Do you want me to leave?

44:26.467 --> 44:28.102
No, it should be quick.

44:28.135 --> 44:29.370
Um...

44:30.871 --> 44:32.273
By the way,
Jack's going into town

44:32.306 --> 44:33.841
to pick up a part
for the engine, so...

44:33.874 --> 44:35.309
He's not gonna be back
for lunch.

44:35.342 --> 44:37.011
He'll see you
after practice.

Hi, this is Cole Baird
calling for Margaret Kenney.

44:54.795 --> 44:55.729
Thank you.

45:05.806 --> 45:07.408
RECEPTIONIST:
Yes, thank you.

45:07.441 --> 45:09.476
Jones McKinsey,
can you hold, please?

45:09.511 --> 45:13.247
Jones McKinsey,
can you hold, please?

45:13.280 --> 45:15.816
Jones McKinsey,
may I help you?

45:15.849 --> 45:18.285
Yes. I have your number.

45:18.319 --> 45:20.321
No problem.

45:20.354 --> 45:22.524
I'll have him call you back.

45:22.557 --> 45:24.258
Thank you.

45:24.291 --> 45:25.759
Hi, may I help you?

45:25.793 --> 45:27.529
Hi, I'm Cole Baird,
the new associate.

45:27.562 --> 45:29.263
I've got an appointment with...
Ms. Kenney.

45:29.296 --> 45:30.532
Yes, she's expecting you.

45:30.565 --> 45:32.066
Have a seat.
She'll be with you momentarily.

45:32.099 --> 45:33.901
Thank you.
You're welcome.

45:33.934 --> 45:35.936
Jones McKinsey, may I help you?

45:37.371 --> 45:38.973
Yes.

Jones McKinsey.

45:43.177 --> 45:44.778
Cole?
Yes.

45:44.812 --> 45:47.248
Hi, I'm Sheila Cordell,
Margaret's assistant.

45:47.281 --> 45:49.116
Hi.
She's ready to see you.

45:50.451 --> 45:51.885
Thank you.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.365
Margaret?

46:04.398 --> 46:07.034
I have Cole Baird for you.

46:07.067 --> 46:08.335
Can I get you
something to drink?

46:08.369 --> 46:11.405
Coffee, or...?
Water would be great, thanks.

46:14.842 --> 46:16.277
So nice to see you again.

46:16.310 --> 46:18.279
Thank you so much for coming in
on short notice.

46:18.312 --> 46:21.282
I know you were hoping to get a
little break before joining us.

46:21.315 --> 46:24.318
We have taken on a case.

46:24.351 --> 46:28.922
I'm gonna need as many hands on
deck as I can possibly muster.

46:28.956 --> 46:32.259
But I'm not even scheduled
to take the Bar until November.

46:32.293 --> 46:33.894
Until you passed the Bar,

46:33.927 --> 46:35.829
you will be
in a supporting role.

46:35.863 --> 46:38.032
And we will make best efforts

46:38.065 --> 46:41.569
to give you the time you need
to prepare to take the exam.

46:41.603 --> 46:43.871
( knocking )
Oh, Brian.

46:43.904 --> 46:48.208
Good. I want
to introduce you to Cole Baird.

46:48.242 --> 46:50.210
He's the associate
I was speaking with you about.

46:50.244 --> 46:53.480
Brian, could you show Cole
to his office?

46:55.349 --> 46:57.051
Oh, wait. Right now?

46:57.084 --> 46:59.453
Sorry, weren't you
planning on staying?

46:59.486 --> 47:01.388
Well-- No.

47:01.422 --> 47:04.992
Actually, I--
I-I'm sorry, I can't stay.

47:05.025 --> 47:07.562
I'm committed through July.
We had discussed this.

47:10.197 --> 47:14.935
Your drive impressed
a great many people around here

47:14.968 --> 47:17.505
during your initial
interview process, Cole.

47:17.539 --> 47:19.239
I don't mind telling you
that you stood out

47:19.273 --> 47:22.510
among your class
of associates.

47:22.544 --> 47:24.945
I hope we didn't misread
your level of commitment.

47:28.115 --> 47:30.918
I know that this is
somewhat unexpected,

47:30.951 --> 47:33.655
but that is the nature
of this business.

47:33.688 --> 47:37.424
And I'm sorry if your vacation
plans have been interfered.

47:37.458 --> 47:39.259
Look, it's not
that I'm not committed,

47:39.293 --> 47:41.462
it's just I-I had
promised a friend...

47:41.495 --> 47:44.965
Let me be clear.
We need you here now, Cole.

47:52.607 --> 47:55.876
All right. Okay.

47:58.178 --> 48:02.149
Brian, take care
of this young man.

48:02.182 --> 48:03.917
We appreciate your
flexibility on this.

48:03.951 --> 48:05.319
Yeah.

that I could do.

56:17.545 --> 56:19.847
You saw him today.

56:19.881 --> 56:21.381
Yeah, I know.

56:22.650 --> 56:24.719
We haven't really talked
in a long time.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.589
Yeah, that's what I thought.

56:28.623 --> 56:31.058
Another beer?
Yes, please.

56:31.092 --> 56:33.426
For you. Sarah?

56:33.460 --> 56:34.595
More water. Okay.

56:47.808 --> 56:49.610
You want one?

56:49.644 --> 56:50.978
Uh, no.

56:51.012 --> 56:54.148
I'm gonna go for a run
before hitting the sack.

56:54.181 --> 56:55.883
( clears throat )

56:58.986 --> 57:02.757
So I got a call from Phil Marcum
this morning.

57:02.790 --> 57:04.158
Who's he?

57:04.191 --> 57:06.727
Partner in San Francisco.

57:06.761 --> 57:09.597
Uh, he's lead
on the Agricon account.

57:09.630 --> 57:12.133
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

57:12.166 --> 57:14.001
Um...

57:14.035 --> 57:18.806
It looks like I've been assigned
to help him with the pitch.

57:18.839 --> 57:20.841
Why you?
You're a trial lawyer.

57:20.875 --> 57:23.811
( clears throat )
Sarah?

57:23.844 --> 57:26.514
I called him.

57:26.547 --> 57:28.549
You know,
Agricon is a huge account,

57:28.582 --> 57:32.687
and the firm is pitching
for their M&A advisory business.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.990
And as I said,
you're a trial lawyer.

57:38.960 --> 57:43.631
I um... I-I told them
that I could help them

57:43.664 --> 57:45.498
with my knowledge
of the farming industry.

57:45.533 --> 57:47.702
Your knowledge
of the farming industry?

57:47.735 --> 57:50.538
Cole, look, I'm just trying
to work my angles here.

57:50.571 --> 57:52.139
That's how you win
at this game.

57:52.173 --> 57:54.742
Look, Agricon is killing
the family farm.

57:54.775 --> 57:56.043
You've heard the stories.

57:56.077 --> 57:57.812
Everybody I know
is being affected by them.

57:57.845 --> 58:01.115
Everybody you know
is not being affected by them.

58:01.148 --> 58:05.019
And some people are happy
for the opportunity to sell.

58:05.052 --> 58:07.788
No, I'm not comfortable
with this.

58:07.822 --> 58:09.256
( scoffs )

58:14.795 --> 58:16.097
All yours.

58:16.130 --> 58:17.598
Good job.

58:17.631 --> 58:19.066
Good news, Margaret.

58:19.100 --> 58:21.268
What's up?
We just got a call from Ottawa.

58:21.302 --> 58:22.737
Done deal.

58:22.770 --> 58:24.271
What?

58:24.305 --> 58:26.540
And our own Mr. Baird
is credited with saving the day.

58:26.574 --> 58:28.142
Well, this is a big win.

58:28.175 --> 58:31.912
There's just no stopping
our young partner these days.

58:31.946 --> 58:34.081
You have it?
I do.

58:34.115 --> 58:35.816
Show me. Thank you.
After you. Yep.

58:35.850 --> 58:37.218
It is a big deal.

58:37.251 --> 58:39.186
I have to say I definitely
got the attention

58:39.220 --> 58:40.955
of the management committee.

58:40.988 --> 58:43.657
JACK:
<i>That's great, buddy.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

58:43.691 --> 58:45.326
Thanks.

58:45.359 --> 58:48.062
Yeah, I've got a big event
at the Canadian Embassy tonight.

58:48.095 --> 58:50.598
So it'll be interesting
to see their reaction.

58:50.631 --> 58:53.167
I definitely thing they were
less excited with the outcome.

58:53.200 --> 58:57.671
Hey, uh, listen. Things have
been a little tight lately.

58:57.705 --> 58:59.273
And um...

58:59.306 --> 59:01.909
I could use
some unskilled labor.

59:01.942 --> 59:05.179
Think I could bribe you
with a few beers this weekend?

59:06.781 --> 59:08.282
Jack. I wish I could, man,

59:08.315 --> 59:12.019
but we've got a thing
at the Club on Saturday,

59:12.053 --> 59:14.789
and Sarah will kill me
if I miss it.

59:14.822 --> 59:17.792
No big deal. Don't sweat it.
I gotta run. Um...

59:17.825 --> 59:19.660
I'll catch you later. All right?

59:19.693 --> 59:21.929
Thanks. I'll talk to you later.

59:34.108 --> 59:36.077
( classical music playing )

59:36.110 --> 59:37.645
( people chattering
indistinctly )

59:53.828 --> 59:55.162
SARAH:
No, it, like--

59:55.196 --> 59:56.864
Oh, excuse me. Thank you.

59:56.897 --> 59:58.766
Thank you.
Cheers.

1:00:00.367 --> 1:00:01.869
I'll tell you what,
these events

1:00:01.902 --> 1:00:03.737
are starting to blur
one to the next.

1:00:03.771 --> 1:00:05.206
( Sarah chuckles )
COLE: I'll just be happy

1:00:05.239 --> 1:00:08.309
if they serve real coffee
instead of decaf in a thimble.

1:00:08.342 --> 1:00:10.644
Oh, stop.

1:00:10.678 --> 1:00:12.279
Representing the firm
at these events

1:00:12.313 --> 1:00:14.815
will go a long way
in advancing our agenda.

1:00:14.849 --> 1:00:16.217
You know what I mean.

1:00:16.250 --> 1:00:17.651
Yeah.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:21.222
Mm!

1:00:21.255 --> 1:00:22.389
Holly and Sean!

1:00:22.423 --> 1:00:23.858
Can I swap you?

1:00:23.891 --> 1:00:25.059
Thank you.

1:00:25.092 --> 1:00:26.994
SARAH:
It has been-- Good.

1:00:27.027 --> 1:00:29.763
We had-- Did you
just get back into town?

1:00:29.797 --> 1:00:31.832
HOLLY:
We were just talking
about staying.

1:00:31.866 --> 1:00:33.400
Oh, wow.

1:00:33.434 --> 1:00:35.769
So it's a wonderful trip.

1:00:35.803 --> 1:00:37.738
( conversation fading )

1:00:42.977 --> 1:00:44.745
SARAH:
It was a great event tonight.

1:00:44.778 --> 1:00:45.846
COLE:
Yeah.

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:47.414
It was a long one, anyway.

1:00:47.448 --> 1:00:48.849
( Sarah chuckles )

1:00:50.284 --> 1:00:54.788
Um...
So I got some news today.

1:00:54.822 --> 1:00:58.292
We won. Our pitch.
We blew them away.

1:00:58.325 --> 1:00:59.960
We got the account.

1:00:59.994 --> 1:01:02.396
Yeah, Meyers Tate will now be
representing Agricon

1:01:02.429 --> 1:01:05.666
in all land deals
east of the Mississippi.

1:01:07.735 --> 1:01:09.937
Wow. Sarah, congratulations.

1:01:09.970 --> 1:01:11.805
I'm so happy for you.

1:01:11.839 --> 1:01:15.743
Look, you worked hard.
And I'm happy you won.

1:01:15.776 --> 1:01:17.444
But you know how I feel
about that account.

1:01:17.478 --> 1:01:19.313
You know, look,
it's just business.

1:01:19.346 --> 1:01:22.082
And maybe it's a good thing.

1:01:22.116 --> 1:01:23.484
They're doing
a lot of innovation

1:01:23.518 --> 1:01:26.720
that'll help the farmers
and give them a chance.

1:01:26.754 --> 1:01:32.026
Yeah. Until the next purchase
and the next, I mean...

1:01:32.059 --> 1:01:35.095
You and I both know what this
looks like going forward.

1:01:35.129 --> 1:01:37.131
A way of life is disappearing.
( scoffs )

1:01:37.164 --> 1:01:38.966
Don't be so dramatic.

1:01:42.970 --> 1:01:44.305
It would really
mean a lot to me

1:01:44.338 --> 1:01:46.240
if you would recuse yourself
from this account.

1:01:48.842 --> 1:01:51.178
Cole...

1:01:51.212 --> 1:01:55.149
I'm not in a position
to make waves right now.

1:01:55.182 --> 1:02:00.087
This is my partner moment,
and I can't just pass it up.

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.957
It's just, these are
my people, Sarah.

1:02:02.990 --> 1:02:06.227
They are not your people.

1:02:06.260 --> 1:02:08.796
So please,
just don't make this

1:02:08.829 --> 1:02:11.265
a bigger deal
than it needs to be.

1:02:13.801 --> 1:02:16.971
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:02:18.072 --> 1:02:19.740
( phone ringing )

1:02:23.177 --> 1:02:25.112
Dad?

1:02:25.145 --> 1:02:26.847
What's up?

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.516
<i>Eastern is being bought.</i>

1:02:28.550 --> 1:02:30.552
Yeah, Dad, I've heard.

1:02:30.585 --> 1:02:32.520
<i>I don't ha--</i>

1:02:32.554 --> 1:02:35.289
<i>I'm supposed to sign something.</i>
<i>I think I--</i>

1:02:35.322 --> 1:02:37.891
<i>I have a few legal questions.</i>

1:02:37.925 --> 1:02:39.326
What are you referring to?

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:43.197
<i>They've sent me</i>
<i>some employment documents.</i>

1:02:43.230 --> 1:02:44.865
What kind of documents?

1:02:44.898 --> 1:02:48.536
<i>"At will" employment...</i>
<i>I'm supposed to sign...</i>

1:02:48.570 --> 1:02:51.972
Wait, wait.
Dad, don't sign anything.

1:02:52.006 --> 1:02:53.508
When do you need
to return these?

1:02:53.541 --> 1:02:55.943
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i> what some of these terms mean.</i>

1:02:55.976 --> 1:02:59.179
<i>There's a lot more</i>
<i>than we ever did at Eastern.</i>

1:02:59.213 --> 1:03:02.850
<i>Auditors were in today.</i>
<i>Reviewing the loan portfolio.</i>

1:03:02.883 --> 1:03:06.253
Dad. Listen to me. Don't sign
anything until I take a look.

1:03:06.287 --> 1:03:07.821
Can it wait a few weeks?

1:03:07.855 --> 1:03:09.189
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

1:03:09.223 --> 1:03:11.959
Okay. Good.
Can you scan them...?

1:03:11.992 --> 1:03:13.260
Actually, you know what,
forget it.

1:03:13.294 --> 1:03:15.195
Can you fax them to me?

1:03:15.229 --> 1:03:18.165
<i>Oh, it's-- It's a lot.</i>

1:03:18.198 --> 1:03:23.871
Okay. Just hold onto them
until I can get out there, okay?

1:03:23.904 --> 1:03:27.141
And don't sign anything.

1:03:27.174 --> 1:03:29.043
Dad, did you hear me?

1:03:29.076 --> 1:03:31.278
<i>I can do this.</i>
<i>I'm not an idiot.</i>

1:03:31.312 --> 1:03:33.515
<i>I just have</i>
<i>a few questions.</i>

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:36.250
I know you can.
Just let me take a look.

1:03:36.283 --> 1:03:38.152
People do hire lawyers
for this, you know.

1:03:38.185 --> 1:03:40.888
<i>Okay.</i>
Okay.

1:03:40.921 --> 1:03:43.490
Good, I'll call you
when I can come.

1:03:46.927 --> 1:03:49.564
O-one more thing. I was...

1:03:52.399 --> 1:03:56.103
I wondered
if you and Sarah would...

1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:00.841
<i>Would what?</i>

1:04:02.577 --> 1:04:08.282
I was wondering if you'd like
to come home for Thanksgiving.

1:04:09.383 --> 1:04:11.118
Um...

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.456
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if we've made plans.</i>

1:04:15.489 --> 1:04:17.891
<i>So let me check with Sarah.</i>

1:04:17.925 --> 1:04:23.364
Actually...why don't you
come to our place.

1:04:23.397 --> 1:04:26.066
I've got a meeting with
the management evening before,

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.435
and I gotta be at the office
early on Friday.

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:31.639
Your mother always used to--

1:04:31.673 --> 1:04:38.646
Always used to have Thanksgiving
at home. Here.

1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:41.683
Yeah. I know, Dad.

1:04:41.716 --> 1:04:44.051
But you haven't seen
our new house.

1:04:44.084 --> 1:04:47.388
It would be the best opportunity
for you to see it.

1:04:47.421 --> 1:04:50.357
All right. Okay.

1:04:52.259 --> 1:04:53.695
<i>Okay?</i>

1:04:53.728 --> 1:04:55.195
Hm.

1:04:55.229 --> 1:04:57.364
<i>All right. We'll plan on it.</i>

1:04:57.398 --> 1:04:59.333

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:14.314
( footsteps approaching )

1:05:20.688 --> 1:05:22.557
Let's get some sleep.

1:05:22.590 --> 1:05:24.191
I'll figure it out.

1:05:31.666 --> 1:05:34.368
Elle, I said I don't want you
to have to worry about it.

1:05:34.401 --> 1:05:36.203
Okay? I'll take care of it.

1:05:36.236 --> 1:05:38.372
Just let me take care of it.

1:05:41.175 --> 1:05:43.177
I get my paycheck next week.

1:05:43.210 --> 1:05:45.479
That'll help a little.

1:05:51.619 --> 1:05:53.287
( chair scrapes )

1:06:04.264 --> 1:06:05.667
I'm sorry.

1:06:09.102 --> 1:06:10.705
I'm sorry.

1:06:10.738 --> 1:06:12.406
I just--

1:06:12.439 --> 1:06:14.208
You know,
my grandfather and my father,

1:06:14.241 --> 1:06:17.110
they kept this place afloat
for 60 years.

1:06:17.144 --> 1:06:19.480
And now I've just got you and
the girls trapped out here.

1:06:19.514 --> 1:06:21.616
And I just feel like you just--

1:06:23.417 --> 1:06:26.086
I just feel like you could've
had so much more.

1:06:27.755 --> 1:06:30.324
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1:06:32.092 --> 1:06:33.761
We'll figure it out.

1:06:33.795 --> 1:06:36.731
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:06:46.841 --> 1:06:48.242
Yep.

1:06:51.613 --> 1:06:54.448
Just get some sleep,
okay, baby?

1:06:59.119 --> 1:07:00.354
Yeah.

1:07:24.177 --> 1:07:25.312
Hey.

1:07:26.648 --> 1:07:28.115
What're you doin' here
so late?

1:07:28.148 --> 1:07:29.817
( sighs )
Same as you.

1:07:31.553 --> 1:07:33.287
Hey, what do you know
about Agricon?

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.589
That's like saying:

1:07:34.622 --> 1:07:36.524
"What do you know
about General Dynamics?"

1:07:36.558 --> 1:07:39.226
I mean, they're huge, they're
everywhere, and they're hungry.

1:07:39.259 --> 1:07:40.494
Why?

1:07:42.396 --> 1:07:45.499
You think a small town has any
shot, if they come knocking?

1:07:45.533 --> 1:07:47.234
Not unless they hire
Cole Baird.

1:07:47.267 --> 1:07:49.571
But uh, I doubt
they can afford you.

1:07:50.905 --> 1:07:52.406
Go home, Cole.

1:07:56.778 --> 1:07:59.313
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:08:13.695 --> 1:08:16.363
Well, this is it.

1:08:16.396 --> 1:08:19.867
It's bigger than we need,
but Sarah wants it, so...

1:08:21.903 --> 1:08:24.404
The realtor left the door
unlocked for us.

1:08:24.438 --> 1:08:30.410
Looks like you have a little
water damage under the dormers.

1:08:34.314 --> 1:08:38.318
You've gotta
have that looked at.

1:08:38.352 --> 1:08:40.387
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:43.390
Everything looks delicious.

1:08:43.423 --> 1:08:46.460
Well, I had big shoes
to fill.

1:08:46.493 --> 1:08:51.231
That house is something else.

1:08:51.264 --> 1:08:54.401
Yeah, it was exactly
what we were looking for.

1:08:54.434 --> 1:08:56.303
A little expansion
of the in-law suite,

1:08:56.336 --> 1:08:57.572
and it will be
near perfect.

1:08:57.605 --> 1:08:59.306
( Sarah laughs )

1:08:59.339 --> 1:09:02.209
Well, there's always room
for you, Dad.

1:09:02.242 --> 1:09:05.880
Hopefully, this will be
the first of many holidays.

1:09:05.913 --> 1:09:09.182
Um, Cole told me about Union.

1:09:09.216 --> 1:09:11.786
I'm sure they're happy to have
someone with your expertise

1:09:11.819 --> 1:09:13.521
guiding the merger.

1:09:13.554 --> 1:09:14.956
Complicated, yes.

1:09:14.989 --> 1:09:16.390
Forces my hand on issues

1:09:16.423 --> 1:09:19.359
that would otherwise
work themselves out.

1:09:19.393 --> 1:09:22.530
Agricon came sniffing around
last week.

1:09:22.563 --> 1:09:24.832
These guys are a piece of work.

1:09:24.866 --> 1:09:27.568
I mean, do you believe
they had the gall

1:09:27.602 --> 1:09:30.705
to ask which properties
might be under stress?

1:09:30.738 --> 1:09:32.674
Unethical bastards.

1:09:32.707 --> 1:09:34.709
I told them to get the hell
out of my office.

1:09:34.742 --> 1:09:38.713
Do-- Do you want some
cranberry sauce? It's Teresa's.

1:09:38.746 --> 1:09:40.414
Oh.
Yeah.

1:09:40.447 --> 1:09:43.283
As if I would share
that information.

1:09:43.316 --> 1:09:45.318
They said they work closely

1:09:45.352 --> 1:09:48.790
with Union's real estate group
out of Houston.

1:09:48.823 --> 1:09:53.861
They that said Union had helped
to "move things on"

1:09:53.895 --> 1:09:57.699
in certain cases,
whatever the hell that means.

1:09:57.732 --> 1:09:59.232
( scoffs )

1:09:59.266 --> 1:10:01.969
Maybe they get away
with that nonsense in Texas,

1:10:02.003 --> 1:10:05.506
but we do things differently
on the Eastern Shore.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.511
And they asked about
the Stapleton place...

1:10:10.545 --> 1:10:15.883
I guess it's
the Miller place now.

1:10:15.917 --> 1:10:20.521
How they would even know these
parcels by name is beyond me.

1:10:20.555 --> 1:10:23.524
The properties aren't even
listed for sale.

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:28.462
So...

1:10:30.798 --> 1:10:33.400
how was the meeting yesterday?

1:10:33.433 --> 1:10:38.338
Um, here's to the youngest
managing partner

1:10:38.371 --> 1:10:40.641
in the history
of Jones McKinsey!

1:10:40.675 --> 1:10:42.275
Just because Margaret Kenney
is retiring

1:10:42.309 --> 1:10:43.678
doesn't mean
I'm in line for the job.

1:10:43.711 --> 1:10:46.279
Why not?
It's a big firm, Dad.

1:10:46.313 --> 1:10:48.381
There are a lot of people
interested in that position.

1:10:48.415 --> 1:10:49.784
Haven't you told them
you want it?

1:10:49.817 --> 1:10:51.351
First of all,
it doesn't work that way.

1:10:51.384 --> 1:10:52.787
And second of all,
maybe I don't.

1:10:52.820 --> 1:10:54.421
You'd be perfect for it,
Cole.

1:10:54.454 --> 1:10:55.656
Sarah, drop it.

1:10:55.690 --> 1:10:57.058
A little enthusiasm
wouldn't hurt.

1:10:57.091 --> 1:10:58.593
When I first came
to Eastern...

1:10:58.626 --> 1:10:59.927
Dad, please.
He's right.

1:10:59.961 --> 1:11:01.829
You should be on the offensive--
Enough!

1:11:17.645 --> 1:11:19.781
How did Agricon know
to ask about Jack's place?

1:11:23.551 --> 1:11:24.652
Right.

1:11:35.062 --> 1:11:37.098
( <i>auctioneer speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly</i> )

1:11:37.131 --> 1:11:39.000
I know a couple of ladies are
here for their husbands.

1:11:39.033 --> 1:11:41.936
One guy wants
to load hay with it.

1:11:41.969 --> 1:11:43.336
Let's start it off here.

1:11:43.370 --> 1:11:45.039
( speaking rapidly )

1:11:48.109 --> 1:11:49.844
Twenty-five, can I get 30,000?

1:11:49.877 --> 1:11:51.946
Thirty-five thousand.

1:11:53.413 --> 1:11:55.616
Thirty-five, let me get 750,
37,500.

1:11:55.650 --> 1:11:56.851
How about 40,000?

1:11:56.884 --> 1:11:59.086
The bids in.
The lady here, $40,000.

1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.889
Let me get 42,500.

1:12:01.923 --> 1:12:04.959
Forty-two thousand.
Let me get 42,500.

1:12:09.429 --> 1:12:11.065
You got it?
Oh, yeah.

1:12:11.098 --> 1:12:12.867
Don't want you
to get your hands dirty.

1:12:12.900 --> 1:12:14.936
Shut up.

1:12:16.537 --> 1:12:18.773
Dad said
you're starting a new job?

1:12:18.806 --> 1:12:21.542
Phew! Yeah, he's too much.

1:12:21.576 --> 1:12:24.846
You know, firms are all about
hours. It's just more hours.

1:12:24.879 --> 1:12:26.681
Watch your hands.

1:12:26.714 --> 1:12:28.950
More money too, I hope.

1:12:28.983 --> 1:12:30.852
No, the money's a trap.

1:12:30.885 --> 1:12:34.055
Oh, yeah? Well,
let me tell you somethin':

1:12:34.088 --> 1:12:36.123
No money is a tighter trap.

1:12:38.491 --> 1:12:40.528
I've got a change in mind
myself.

1:12:40.561 --> 1:12:42.997
Oh, yeah?
Goats.

1:12:43.030 --> 1:12:44.464
Goats?

1:12:44.497 --> 1:12:46.433
Goat cheese. Goat's milk.

1:12:46.466 --> 1:12:48.769
And there's a growing local
market for goat meat.

1:12:48.803 --> 1:12:51.105
I'm hopin' it'll help cover
the shortfall.

1:12:51.138 --> 1:12:53.641
And the additional acreage

1:12:53.674 --> 1:12:55.710
let me plant multiple crops
a season.

1:12:55.743 --> 1:13:00.447
Won't be stuck with a single
wipe out, like this year.

1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:03.416
Okay, so you're--

1:13:03.450 --> 1:13:06.053
You're what? You're just gonna
go out and buy a herd of goats?

1:13:06.087 --> 1:13:09.757
Bought 'em.
They delivered them last week.

1:13:09.790 --> 1:13:12.693
Jack, what the hell do you know
about farming goats?

1:13:12.727 --> 1:13:14.128
What's there to know.

1:13:14.161 --> 1:13:16.697
You feed 'em, milk 'em
and send 'em to slaughter.

1:13:16.731 --> 1:13:19.066
Jack, you need to get focused.
How are you affording this?

1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:20.635
My grandpa always said

1:13:20.668 --> 1:13:22.737
never underestimate
the power of a big idea.

1:13:22.770 --> 1:13:24.505
I don't know that I'd call
goats a big idea.

1:13:24.538 --> 1:13:26.874
What the hell is your problem?

1:13:26.908 --> 1:13:28.743
I appreciate you coming out
to help.

1:13:28.776 --> 1:13:31.579
I really-- I do.

1:13:31.612 --> 1:13:35.216
But none of this is
any of your business, now is it?

1:13:35.249 --> 1:13:37.685
You're right.
I'm just trying to be a friend.

1:13:37.718 --> 1:13:40.487
You have no idea
what it's like to be broke.

1:13:40.521 --> 1:13:42.156
I'm busting my ass
just to make it here.

1:13:42.189 --> 1:13:44.659
No, what you are doing,
Jack, is flailing.

1:13:44.692 --> 1:13:46.459
You're gonna end up
crawling to Agricon--

1:13:46.493 --> 1:13:48.763
Say what you really mean.
Elle deserves better.

1:13:48.796 --> 1:13:52.233
That's not what I said.
That's what you fucking meant.

1:13:52.266 --> 1:13:54.635
All I'm saying is
you're digging yourself a hole

1:13:54.669 --> 1:13:56.170
that you might not be able
to get out of.

1:13:56.203 --> 1:13:58.806
Big job. You got a fancy house.
Fancy car.

1:13:58.839 --> 1:14:00.641
You think that gives you the
right to tell me what to do?

1:14:00.675 --> 1:14:02.710
Oh, come on.

1:14:02.743 --> 1:14:04.845
What? Are you jealous?
Is that what this is?

1:14:04.879 --> 1:14:06.847
Jealous?

1:14:06.881 --> 1:14:10.017
What would I have
to be jealous of, Cole?

1:14:10.051 --> 1:14:12.586
I have Elle and the farm,

1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:14.487
the two things
you've always wanted.

1:14:16.157 --> 1:14:17.792
Fuck you.
Yeah.

1:14:19.827 --> 1:14:21.262
Look at yourself.

1:14:21.295 --> 1:14:22.663
Yeah, what is that
supposed to mean?

1:14:22.697 --> 1:14:24.632
Who are you?

1:14:40.915 --> 1:14:42.717
Good morning, chickens.

1:14:42.750 --> 1:14:44.285
Good morning!

1:14:44.318 --> 1:14:46.120
Good morning.
Good morning, Daddy.

1:14:46.153 --> 1:14:47.989
Baby, will you remind me,

1:14:48.022 --> 1:14:50.124
I'm expecting a bid
from Thompkins Fencing

1:14:50.157 --> 1:14:51.692
to replace that gap
in the fence.

1:14:51.726 --> 1:14:54.528
Yeah. Sure.
And that reminds me.

1:14:54.562 --> 1:14:56.664
You got a letter
from Eastern bank yesterday.

1:14:56.697 --> 1:14:57.865
I don't know
if it was important.

1:14:57.898 --> 1:14:59.900
But I left it on the hall table.

1:14:59.934 --> 1:15:02.203
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:15:19.186 --> 1:15:21.088
You girls ready for some bacon?

1:16:00.694 --> 1:16:02.129
Well, wait till you
taste the eggs

1:16:02.163 --> 1:16:04.765
your mama whipped up
this morning.

1:16:04.799 --> 1:16:08.002
I'd say you two are about
the luckiest girls in the world.

1:16:32.026 --> 1:16:33.894
Y'all be good.

1:16:33.928 --> 1:16:35.796
See ya later, Daddy.

1:16:35.830 --> 1:16:37.932
Have a good day, Daddy.

1:16:40.401 --> 1:16:42.002
Bye, babe.

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:43.370
JACK:
Bye, baby.

1:16:43.404 --> 1:16:44.839
( door closes )

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:13.555
( bang )

1:19:13.588 --> 1:19:15.155
( alarm beeping )
( gasps )

1:19:16.390 --> 1:19:18.259
( shower running )

1:19:18.292 --> 1:19:20.461
Who are you?

1:19:20.494 --> 1:19:22.363
SARAH:
What?

1:19:22.396 --> 1:19:24.431
Nothing. Just something...

1:19:24.465 --> 1:19:26.033
SARAH:
I can't hear you
when you mumble.

1:19:26.066 --> 1:19:27.201
Forget it.

1:19:28.936 --> 1:19:30.104
I need a towel.

1:19:30.137 --> 1:19:31.805
Come on.
I got it.

1:19:41.482 --> 1:19:44.218
Let's go to our expansion.
( knocking )

1:19:44.251 --> 1:19:45.553
West Coast and plans.

1:19:45.587 --> 1:19:47.254
The acquisition...

1:19:47.288 --> 1:19:48.422
( softly ):
You've got a call.

1:19:50.224 --> 1:19:52.860
Thank you. Cole Baird.

1:19:52.893 --> 1:19:56.263
WOMAN:
Talk to us about their
environmental practice.

1:19:56.297 --> 1:19:59.233
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:20:02.202 --> 1:20:04.305
Cole.

1:20:04.338 --> 1:20:06.340
What's going on?

1:20:47.582 --> 1:20:49.116
It's awful.

1:20:49.149 --> 1:20:52.219
Um, I can drive out.

1:20:52.252 --> 1:20:54.154
<i>No.</i>

1:20:54.188 --> 1:20:56.256
I'll help Elle
with the funeral plans.

1:20:56.290 --> 1:20:58.593
I'll call you
when I know the details.

1:20:58.626 --> 1:21:01.228
And how are you doing?

1:21:03.497 --> 1:21:06.166
Honestly, I don't--
I don't know.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.902
Try to get some sleep.

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:15.109
I love you.

1:21:18.078 --> 1:21:20.080
( sniffles )
I gotta go.

1:21:43.036 --> 1:21:44.905
( screams )

1:22:01.155 --> 1:22:02.590
( burps )

1:22:02.624 --> 1:22:03.991
Another one.

1:22:18.706 --> 1:22:21.241
Goddamn it, Jack.

1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:28.248
I'm at the end of my rope, man.

1:22:39.026 --> 1:22:42.029
Listen, man. Maybe you
should go home, huh?

1:22:42.062 --> 1:22:44.264
Listen. You hear me?
Don't push me! Okay?

1:22:44.298 --> 1:22:45.232
Whoa.

1:22:49.102 --> 1:22:50.638
I'm sorry.

1:23:12.426 --> 1:23:14.328
We're closed.

1:23:32.379 --> 1:23:34.549
Oh, honey.

1:23:41.823 --> 1:23:43.691
Hey Florrie.

1:23:45.092 --> 1:23:47.094
I know.

1:23:48.630 --> 1:23:51.198
How many times

1:23:51.231 --> 1:23:55.737
you and he sat
at these very stools.

1:23:55.770 --> 1:24:00.140
I can still see your young,
happy faces...

1:24:05.279 --> 1:24:07.582
I don't know. None of this
might've happened

1:24:07.615 --> 1:24:09.049
if I'd have just never left.

1:24:10.552 --> 1:24:14.254
I think you're bein' too hard
on yourself.

1:24:14.288 --> 1:24:18.292
Ain't nothing you can do
about the past but let it go.

1:24:20.728 --> 1:24:23.598
Jack had his own worries.

1:24:23.631 --> 1:24:29.169
He had his way of doin' things
that had nothin' to do with you.

1:24:31.171 --> 1:24:34.141
I just don't know
where I belong anymore, Florrie.

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.380
I mean...

1:24:42.182 --> 1:24:45.385
After Elle, I met Sarah,
and she was...

1:24:48.455 --> 1:24:50.692
I mean, she was...

1:24:50.725 --> 1:24:53.427
different, and she was...

1:24:54.929 --> 1:24:57.497
She was exciting, and...

1:25:00.267 --> 1:25:02.570
She helped me focus,
and she challenged me.

1:25:02.604 --> 1:25:03.838
But...

1:25:08.509 --> 1:25:11.244
when I'm here, I know...

1:25:11.278 --> 1:25:13.615
I know exactly who I am.

1:25:14.916 --> 1:25:18.653
A dream that doesn't go away,

1:25:18.686 --> 1:25:21.556
now that's a callin'.

1:25:21.589 --> 1:25:25.627
My mother used to say
that once you realize it,

1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:27.762
you can't help
but get out of its way.

1:25:29.931 --> 1:25:31.833
Maybe it's time
you start paddlin'

1:25:31.866 --> 1:25:35.603
instead of floatin' down
someone else's river.

1:25:35.637 --> 1:25:39.540
You might succeed,
you might fail,

1:25:39.574 --> 1:25:41.643
but you'll never regret it.

1:25:41.676 --> 1:25:44.277
Sure...failure is
a disappointment,

1:25:44.311 --> 1:25:46.446
which hurts a lot.

1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:50.384
But the sting goes away
pretty quickly.

1:25:51.619 --> 1:25:53.387
Now regret?

1:25:54.889 --> 1:25:59.326
That's somethin' that'll
stick with you a lifetime.

1:25:59.359 --> 1:26:01.129
Oh...

1:26:10.571 --> 1:26:14.474
Now let's get some coffee
in you.

1:26:14.509 --> 1:26:16.944
Some aspirin wouldn't hurt,
either.

1:26:16.978 --> 1:26:19.179
You'll thank me in the mornin'.

1:26:33.961 --> 1:26:37.230
The girls are resting.
I put on a movie for them.

1:26:37.264 --> 1:26:38.566
Thank you.

1:26:44.038 --> 1:26:45.707
( paper rustles )

1:26:49.043 --> 1:26:51.344
I found this in his drawer.

1:26:57.819 --> 1:27:01.622
I called them, but they said
they need to, uh...

1:27:01.656 --> 1:27:04.424
investigate the circumstances.

1:27:07.829 --> 1:27:10.898
If the insurance doesn't pay,
we'll have to sell.

1:27:16.037 --> 1:27:17.905
Cole, would you--

1:27:17.939 --> 1:27:20.942
Would you ever
consider buying the farm?

1:27:23.678 --> 1:27:26.246
I-I don't know
what I'm saying.

1:27:27.615 --> 1:27:29.416
Give me some time?

1:27:31.351 --> 1:27:33.286
You really don't have to.

1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.857
I want to...

1:27:35.890 --> 1:27:38.726
at least consider it
before giving you an option.

1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:39.894
Really.

1:27:41.662 --> 1:27:45.566
It'll take some time to sort
through Jack's things anyway.

1:27:47.467 --> 1:27:49.670
Yeah.

1:27:49.704 --> 1:27:52.707
Look, one way or the other,
I'll take some time off.

1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.776
I'll help you guys
get everything settled here.

1:28:01.115 --> 1:28:03.985
God, I'd love to, Elle.

1:28:04.018 --> 1:28:06.888
( goats bleat )

1:28:06.921 --> 1:28:09.090
I can't promise
I'll take the goats, though.

1:28:09.123 --> 1:28:10.792
( chuckles )

1:28:24.739 --> 1:28:26.439
We should go, um...

1:28:26.473 --> 1:28:27.775
Yeah.

1:28:43.490 --> 1:28:45.693
( clock chiming )

1:29:14.655 --> 1:29:16.924
You couldn't find time
to come to the funeral?

1:29:18.559 --> 1:29:20.460
Look, son. I know how you feel.

1:29:20.493 --> 1:29:22.063
No, you have no idea how I feel.

1:29:22.096 --> 1:29:23.931
Elle asked me to buy the farm.

1:29:23.965 --> 1:29:25.733
I know she needs the money.

1:29:25.766 --> 1:29:27.500
No, this isn't
about the money.

1:29:27.535 --> 1:29:30.104
Well, given the circumstances...

1:29:30.137 --> 1:29:33.140
I doubt she'll avoid
the foreclosure.

1:29:34.575 --> 1:29:35.743
What foreclosure?

1:29:35.776 --> 1:29:38.112
Union notified Jack
a few days ago.

1:29:38.145 --> 1:29:40.014
They were calling the loan.

1:29:40.047 --> 1:29:41.883
You were gonna shut him down?

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:44.752
( stammers )
It was out of my hands.

1:29:44.785 --> 1:29:46.921
You should have never
let him do this.

1:29:46.954 --> 1:29:49.156
You knew Jack couldn't afford
that property.

1:29:49.190 --> 1:29:51.058
I couldn't--
What is it about you

1:29:51.092 --> 1:29:53.961
that you think you can gamble
with other people's lives?

1:29:53.995 --> 1:29:55.730
It wasn't up to me.

1:29:55.763 --> 1:29:57.932
They wouldn't let me do it.

1:29:57.965 --> 1:30:00.635
Then you should have called me.
I could have helped.

1:30:00.668 --> 1:30:02.103
I can't discuss customer
accounts with anyone.

1:30:02.136 --> 1:30:04.705
For God's sake, Dad,
it was Jack!

1:30:04.739 --> 1:30:07.174
And Jack specifically told me

1:30:07.208 --> 1:30:11.612
not to mention anything to you
about their personal finances.

1:30:11.646 --> 1:30:13.714
You realize that is probably
what killed him?

1:30:13.748 --> 1:30:15.883
You don't know that.

1:30:15.917 --> 1:30:18.753
Elle is throwing me
a lifeline here.

1:30:18.786 --> 1:30:24.825
I have been waiting for this
moment for 30 fucking years.

1:30:24.859 --> 1:30:26.594
This is my last shot.

1:30:26.627 --> 1:30:29.196
Cole, you're 39 years old.

1:30:29.230 --> 1:30:31.666
This isn't your last shot
to do anything.

1:30:31.699 --> 1:30:34.001
Yesterday I was 16,
tomorrow I'll be 75,

1:30:34.035 --> 1:30:35.836
and I'll have missed it.

1:30:35.870 --> 1:30:39.140
I mean, look at me, Dad!
Look at me!

1:30:39.173 --> 1:30:41.609
I never signed up for this.

1:30:41.642 --> 1:30:44.178
Signed up for what?
An education? A career?

1:30:44.211 --> 1:30:48.649
All of it! The firm. The house.
The club. All of it.

1:30:48.683 --> 1:30:52.586
Good God, Dad,
it's suffocating me!

1:30:52.620 --> 1:30:54.188
This isn't what I wanted.

1:30:54.221 --> 1:30:57.224
You think life just serves up
what you want?

1:30:57.258 --> 1:31:00.928
Look around you. People in this
town are suffering while you...

1:31:00.962 --> 1:31:03.597
You should be thanking me,
for chrissake.

1:31:03.631 --> 1:31:04.932
I gave you options,

1:31:04.966 --> 1:31:07.835
which is more than I had.

1:31:07.868 --> 1:31:10.638
The options that I had
were doled up

1:31:10.671 --> 1:31:12.773
in the order of what you thought
was acceptable.

1:31:12.807 --> 1:31:16.010
You're being juvenile.
I never told you to do anything.

1:31:16.043 --> 1:31:18.846
What you never told me
was to do what I wanted.

1:31:18.879 --> 1:31:21.115
You think I spent my childhood

1:31:21.148 --> 1:31:25.586
dreaming of running a two-bit
bank in bum-fuck, Maryland?

1:31:25.619 --> 1:31:28.589
Open your eyes, son.

1:31:28.622 --> 1:31:30.691
You play the hand you're dealt.

1:31:30.725 --> 1:31:32.026
I took a job at Eastern

1:31:32.059 --> 1:31:33.928
because no one would give me
the time of day

1:31:33.961 --> 1:31:35.262
in Richmond or New York.

1:31:35.296 --> 1:31:37.164
I never planned to stay here
longer than it took

1:31:37.198 --> 1:31:39.200
to settle and put
a little cash aside.

1:31:39.233 --> 1:31:43.004
Then Teresa comes along
and got pregnan--

1:31:46.807 --> 1:31:49.210
Then we got married.

1:31:49.243 --> 1:31:52.713
We had you.

1:31:52.747 --> 1:31:56.183
So a baby comes along,
you get comfortable.

1:31:56.217 --> 1:32:00.955
Time passes and all of a sudden,
you realize.

1:32:00.988 --> 1:32:04.925
All of sudden...

1:32:04.959 --> 1:32:07.895
This is it.

1:32:10.731 --> 1:32:14.935
I wanted to be
a Wall Street banker.

1:32:14.969 --> 1:32:16.804
That's what I was dreaming of.

1:32:16.837 --> 1:32:19.173
A real banker, instead of...

1:32:19.206 --> 1:32:21.308
You wanted to be a farmer

1:32:21.342 --> 1:32:24.045
and instead became
a star attorney

1:32:24.078 --> 1:32:26.947
and a wealthy member
of Washington society.

1:32:26.981 --> 1:32:30.017
Doesn't sound to me
like a bad deal.

1:32:30.051 --> 1:32:33.120
But now you've got
responsibilities.

1:32:33.154 --> 1:32:36.757
Your mother would tell you
the same thing.

1:32:36.791 --> 1:32:40.227
Don't you dare bring mom
into this.

1:32:40.261 --> 1:32:42.630
If you had paid
for her early treatment

1:32:42.663 --> 1:32:44.865
rather than my tuition,
she would still be here.

1:32:44.899 --> 1:32:46.767
That was Teresa's decision,
not mine.

1:32:46.801 --> 1:32:48.035
That is such bullshit.

1:32:48.069 --> 1:32:50.638
You mother
paid for your tuition

1:32:50.671 --> 1:32:54.308
with the money
her father gave her.

1:32:54.341 --> 1:32:56.143
You can see it.

1:32:56.177 --> 1:33:00.347
Her signature
is on the document, Cole.

1:33:14.061 --> 1:33:17.665
So you're gonna
pack it all in

1:33:17.698 --> 1:33:20.101
and work the land?

1:33:24.772 --> 1:33:27.274
Is that it?

1:33:27.308 --> 1:33:29.276
What if it is?

1:33:31.212 --> 1:33:36.684
You've got a romantic notion
of a life that doesn't exist.

1:33:50.965 --> 1:33:52.666
Knock, knock.

1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:55.002
The Boeing team
is in the conference room.

1:33:55.035 --> 1:33:56.971
I'll be with them in a minute.

1:33:57.004 --> 1:34:00.107
Oh, Ms. Kenney asked to see you
after the meeting.

1:34:00.141 --> 1:34:02.243
Regarding?

1:34:02.276 --> 1:34:04.111
Did not say.

1:34:09.850 --> 1:34:11.318
You wanted to see me?

1:34:11.352 --> 1:34:16.690
Yes, Cole, come in. Have a seat.

1:34:16.724 --> 1:34:19.260
How are things going
with the Boeing deal?

1:34:19.293 --> 1:34:21.028
It's fine.

1:34:21.061 --> 1:34:24.899
We've reached an agreement on
all of the major points but one.

1:34:24.932 --> 1:34:27.067
I hope to have it wrapped up
by the end of the month.

1:34:27.101 --> 1:34:28.836
Good.

1:34:28.869 --> 1:34:33.340
Cole, I'm gonna let Carlin
take over the reins on that one.

1:34:33.374 --> 1:34:36.177
What?
He's very versed in the deal.

1:34:36.210 --> 1:34:38.846
He shouldn't have
any problem closing.

1:34:38.879 --> 1:34:41.415
I've been on this deal
for over a year and a half.

1:34:41.448 --> 1:34:43.184
I'd like to see it through
to the end.

1:34:43.217 --> 1:34:46.921
I understand that,
but we have other plans for you.

1:34:46.954 --> 1:34:49.290
Something that can't wait
three weeks?

1:34:49.323 --> 1:34:51.158
( laughs )

1:34:51.192 --> 1:34:54.295
It's gonna take longer than
three weeks, and you know that.

1:34:54.328 --> 1:34:58.065
Be lucky to close that out
by year end.

1:34:59.967 --> 1:35:03.938
I am stepping down
on the 31st.

1:35:03.971 --> 1:35:05.739
And you know that too.

1:35:05.773 --> 1:35:09.210
The Management Committee met
late into the evening last night

1:35:09.243 --> 1:35:11.045
and they have
come to the conclusion

1:35:11.078 --> 1:35:14.181
that you are the right person
to lead this firm.

1:35:17.218 --> 1:35:20.955
We would like you to take on
the role of Managing Partner.

1:35:20.988 --> 1:35:22.890
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

1:35:22.923 --> 1:35:25.159
Jones McKinsey
is at a turning point.

1:35:25.192 --> 1:35:28.362
We need new blood.
Young blood, Cole...

1:35:28.395 --> 1:35:30.231
( dialogue fades )

1:35:39.173 --> 1:35:44.478
At this point, it is traditional
for you to respond.

1:35:44.512 --> 1:35:50.184
Cole, we're handing you
the reins to Jones McKinsey.

1:35:54.021 --> 1:35:55.456
Um...

1:35:55.489 --> 1:35:57.525
( chuckles )

1:35:57.559 --> 1:36:00.427
I'm sorry.
I'm flattered, of course.

1:36:00.461 --> 1:36:02.963
No, we are not doing this
to be flattering.

1:36:02.997 --> 1:36:04.898
You have earned it.

1:36:04.932 --> 1:36:07.535
Surely-surely there must
be somebody else...

1:36:07.569 --> 1:36:12.106
Well, we did not reach this
conclusion easily nor quickly.

1:36:15.442 --> 1:36:17.579
I-I need time.

1:36:17.612 --> 1:36:19.346
Of course. Of course.

1:36:19.380 --> 1:36:22.883
You need time to discuss it.
We can do that tomorrow.

1:36:22.916 --> 1:36:25.152
Unfortunately,
I'm going off to a meeting.

1:36:25.185 --> 1:36:28.523
I'm late, so we will
discuss this tomorrow.

1:36:28.556 --> 1:36:30.858
Huh?
Yeah.

1:36:30.891 --> 1:36:33.227
Great. Good.
Congratulations.

1:36:40.367 --> 1:36:42.136
( chuckles )

1:36:49.143 --> 1:36:52.112
( upbeat jazzy music playing )

1:36:52.146 --> 1:36:53.480
COLE:
Thank you.

1:36:55.449 --> 1:36:58.586
I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, it's fine.

1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:02.056
Uh, gave me a chance
to catch up on e-mails.

1:37:02.089 --> 1:37:03.057
( clears throat )

1:37:05.125 --> 1:37:06.093
You okay?

1:37:06.126 --> 1:37:09.296
Elle offered me...

1:37:09.330 --> 1:37:10.565
Us...

1:37:10.598 --> 1:37:12.499
the opportunity to buy the farm.

1:37:14.602 --> 1:37:18.372
And I think I'd like to do it.

1:37:18.405 --> 1:37:21.141
Wow. What is she asking for it?

1:37:21.175 --> 1:37:24.311
I don't know.
We didn't really talk about it.

1:37:24.345 --> 1:37:28.315
Surely there are
other buyers that...

1:37:28.349 --> 1:37:31.285
It seems like a lot
to take on.

1:37:31.318 --> 1:37:35.923
I know you have an emotional
attachment to it...

1:37:37.391 --> 1:37:40.294
but I'm sure we could find
a weekend place that's

1:37:40.327 --> 1:37:42.096
less expensive and less work.

1:37:42.129 --> 1:37:44.131
I'm not thinking of this--
Although, it would be nice

1:37:44.164 --> 1:37:45.499
to have a place to stay at.

1:37:45.533 --> 1:37:47.167
I know you don't like to stay
with your dad...

1:37:47.201 --> 1:37:49.903
Sarah. Stop.

1:37:49.937 --> 1:37:54.041
I'm not talking about
a weekend place.

1:37:54.074 --> 1:37:56.644
I'm talking about
running the farm,

1:37:56.678 --> 1:37:59.614
and continuing it as a business.

1:37:59.647 --> 1:38:02.182
( scoffs )

1:38:02.216 --> 1:38:04.418
And how would you even do that?

1:38:04.451 --> 1:38:07.221
You barely have enough time
in the day as it is.

1:38:07.254 --> 1:38:10.190
How do you expect
to oversee a working farm?

1:38:10.224 --> 1:38:12.292
Sarah, I'm talking about--
Thank you.

1:38:12.326 --> 1:38:13.927
Thanks.

1:38:13.961 --> 1:38:16.497
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

1:38:16.531 --> 1:38:20.635
I'm thinking of a major change.

1:38:20.668 --> 1:38:23.003
What if I left the firm

1:38:23.036 --> 1:38:25.205
and continued
the operation myself?

1:38:25.239 --> 1:38:27.509
Cole, you're not serious.

1:38:27.542 --> 1:38:29.243
I am.
( scoffs )

1:38:29.276 --> 1:38:30.678
( sighs )

1:38:30.712 --> 1:38:35.015
I think you really should
think about taking a break.

1:38:35.048 --> 1:38:37.685
This thing with Jack...
I know you're still hurting.

1:38:37.719 --> 1:38:40.187
This isn't about Jack.

1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:42.356
This is about us.

1:38:42.389 --> 1:38:45.225
You and me. You know
I've always wanted to do this.

1:38:45.259 --> 1:38:48.262
Jack's death made me realize
how fleeting the opportunity is.

1:38:48.295 --> 1:38:50.197
Cole, get real.

1:38:50.230 --> 1:38:54.501
You are not going to quit
your job to become a farmer.

1:38:54.536 --> 1:38:57.304
Sarah, I want to do this.

1:38:57.337 --> 1:38:59.707
I mean, I really wanna do this.

1:39:01.341 --> 1:39:04.178
We're not having
this conversation right now.

1:39:06.346 --> 1:39:09.283
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:39:09.316 --> 1:39:13.187
Look, it's just--
No, Cole, this is stupid.

1:39:13.220 --> 1:39:16.323
We're not moving to Jack's farm.

1:39:16.356 --> 1:39:17.725
God, I don't know
what Elle was thinking,

1:39:17.759 --> 1:39:20.127
proposing something
like this to you.

1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:24.398
She has no comprehension
of our quality of life.

1:39:24.431 --> 1:39:26.133
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

1:39:26.166 --> 1:39:30.103
No. Everything looks delicious,
thank you.

1:39:30.137 --> 1:39:33.608
Seriously, sweetheart, I think
that you should consider

1:39:33.641 --> 1:39:35.342
taking somewhat of a break.

1:39:35.375 --> 1:39:37.712
I know you've been
so stressed at work...

1:39:37.745 --> 1:39:39.514
And this thing with Jack...

1:39:39.547 --> 1:39:42.416
Stop saying that.
This is not a "thing with Jack!"

1:39:42.449 --> 1:39:44.384
Jack is dead! He put a gun
to his head, remember?

1:39:44.418 --> 1:39:45.787
He did not.
Well, he may as well have.

1:39:45.820 --> 1:39:48.155
Will you lower your voice,
please.

1:39:52.627 --> 1:39:55.395
I just-- I think...

1:39:55.429 --> 1:39:57.464
that Jack's death...

1:39:57.498 --> 1:40:01.335
may have had more of an impact
on you than you may realize.

1:40:03.070 --> 1:40:04.271
I wanted to tell you

1:40:04.304 --> 1:40:06.039
what happened
at the courthouse today.

1:40:06.073 --> 1:40:08.242
I'm not done here.
Look.

1:40:08.275 --> 1:40:10.545
I'm not sure what
mid-life crisis you're having,

1:40:10.578 --> 1:40:12.614
but you need
to get your shit together.

1:40:12.647 --> 1:40:16.116
I have a lot going on and it's
about time you're a part of it.

1:40:16.149 --> 1:40:19.386
So grow the fuck up, Cole.
Okay.

1:40:19.419 --> 1:40:21.756
You can't just change the terms
of the deal mid-stream.

1:40:21.789 --> 1:40:24.258
What, so our marriage
is a deal now?
It kinda is.

1:40:24.291 --> 1:40:28.696
I have given you everything
that you've asked for.

1:40:28.730 --> 1:40:31.064
Okay, great. So I owe you
a great big thank you.

1:40:31.098 --> 1:40:32.534
Is that what
you're looking for?

1:40:32.567 --> 1:40:33.735
Okay, I'm done.

1:40:33.768 --> 1:40:36.470
If you wanna do this thing,
do it alone.

1:40:36.503 --> 1:40:40.140
You know, I'd be very careful
what you wish for.

1:40:41.876 --> 1:40:44.278
Oh, by the way...

1:40:44.311 --> 1:40:46.246
They offered me
managing partner today.

1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:49.751
So that should put a nice
big bow on it for you, right?

I shouldn't have
laid that on you.

1:41:21.281 --> 1:41:22.249
I can't do it.

1:41:22.282 --> 1:41:23.585
I know.

1:41:25.252 --> 1:41:29.156
Look, it's just...
Cole, I know.

1:41:29.189 --> 1:41:31.391
You don't have to make excuses.

1:41:32.727 --> 1:41:34.596
When I didn't hear from you...

1:41:36.664 --> 1:41:40.500
I told Agricon
I'd take their offer.

1:42:01.856 --> 1:42:04.358
Yeah.
Deal.

1:42:05.693 --> 1:42:06.828
Hey.

1:42:07.862 --> 1:42:09.396
Come on.

Stop me from kicking your butt.

1:42:10.497 --> 1:42:11.566
A lot of talk, huh?

1:42:11.599 --> 1:42:12.834
Yeah.
Oh!

1:42:13.534 --> 1:42:15.135
Oh...!

1:42:23.477 --> 1:42:25.312
Found one more.

1:42:25.345 --> 1:42:28.950
It's no problem. There's always
room for one more.

Cole.

There's been a lot of momentum
these last couple of months.

1:44:33.708 --> 1:44:35.442
Thanks, Brian.

1:44:35.475 --> 1:44:36.844
You know, I think success

1:44:36.878 --> 1:44:39.647
just has a way
of finding some people.

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:42.683
Well, it's given me a break
from my personal life.

1:44:42.717 --> 1:44:44.952
There's not much success
going on there, unfortunately.

Mm.

a small place in town.

Oh, man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:44:54.996 --> 1:44:58.099
It's been a long time coming.

1:44:58.132 --> 1:44:59.934
Well,
I know it's no consolation,

1:44:59.967 --> 1:45:02.103
but at least you have your
second love to fall back on.

before school starts.

in the season
