WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.133 --> 00:12.167
'The Geordies are back.'

00:12.233 --> 00:16.000
'Last time we tore the tits off
Australia's Gold Coast.'

00:19.233 --> 00:21.267
(screams)
Ooh, it's coming this way!

00:22.433 --> 00:24.767
Ew!
There's a poo in our room!

00:26.067 --> 00:28.067
(screams) Ow! My vagina!

00:28.133 --> 00:30.700
They taste just like peanuts.
(gags)

00:30.767 --> 00:33.233
'Sophie caught feelings
for Aussie Alex.'

00:33.300 --> 00:35.167
I actually genuinely fancy you!

00:36.067 --> 00:39.200
'Abbie reckons she calls the
shots
when it comes to boys.'

00:40.233 --> 00:41.700
(screaming)

00:43.467 --> 00:46.100
'Chloe and Sam left Oz
more loved up than ever.'

00:47.500 --> 00:49.967
I wanna put it in your arse.

00:50.033 --> 00:52.667
Let this motherfucking party
begin!

00:55.533 --> 00:57.867
This time we are back
where we belong.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.167
Newcastle!

01:01.467 --> 01:02.900
With our friends...

01:02.967 --> 01:04.433
...and family.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.200
Love you!
Yoo-hoo! Nana!

01:07.267 --> 01:09.833
Doing the things we love.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.800
There'll be some new faces.
Hello!

01:15.867 --> 01:17.833
Plenty of old faces.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.533
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

01:19.600 --> 01:22.733
And one big blast from the past!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.400
Long-time no fucking see!

01:25.467 --> 01:26.867
(screaming)

01:26.933 --> 01:28.600
But don't worry.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.467
We're still proper radge.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.633
Which means getting inebriated!

01:34.700 --> 01:36.000
You mean mortal.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.500
Lots of fornication!

01:40.733 --> 01:42.067
Shagging, you divvy!

01:43.567 --> 01:44.967
Hello!

01:45.033 --> 01:46.567
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.433
(shouts)

01:48.500 --> 01:51.633
(screaming)

01:51.700 --> 01:53.933
Fuck off! (roars)

02:00.567 --> 02:02.500
Shut your fucking mouth!

02:02.567 --> 02:05.433
(cheering)
It's gonna be a pure fucking
belter!

02:05.500 --> 02:07.967
(cheering)

02:09.800 --> 02:11.733
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.700
I'm preened to perfection.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.600
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.600
A lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:19.667 --> 02:22.400
I can talk
the back legs off a donkey.

02:22.467 --> 02:25.433
I'm happy-go-lucky, a Jack the
Lad.
That's me to a T.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.167
I'm fit, I'm flirty,
I've got double Fs.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.567
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:35.933 --> 02:38.067
That's the spot right there.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.400
Baby!

02:43.567 --> 02:46.467
Oh, yeah, that feels really
good.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.667
Keep going.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.533
Right in the spot.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.967
Craig, look at him.
He's so handsome.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.367
I love my boyfriend
and my dog, Buddy.

02:56.433 --> 02:59.867
But I haven't seen my Geordie
squad
in a long time and I miss them.

02:59.933 --> 03:02.833
Little baby!
Little baby boy, aren't you,
Buddy?

03:07.633 --> 03:10.900
Me and my boyfriend Jacob
both live very busy lives,

03:10.967 --> 03:14.033
so we've booked a holiday
to spend quality time together.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.767
Good work, keep pushing!
Are you all right, Nana?

03:16.833 --> 03:18.733
It's the best ride I've had,
Abbie!

03:18.800 --> 03:21.333
After all of this partying
my Nana's been doing

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
we need to get fit.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.500
Cos I don't know
any other 64-year-old

03:25.567 --> 03:28.067
that can down five Jagerbombs
on a night out.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.467
Ah! Bastard!

03:33.533 --> 03:36.767
Since Australia, me and Chloe
have bought our first home.

03:36.833 --> 03:40.233
We have come an awful long way
in a very short space of time.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.667
I think I'm actually wife
material!

03:42.733 --> 03:46.167
Since moving, I love to cook.
Our mams couldn't be prouder!

03:47.467 --> 03:48.933
Gorgeous.
Do you like that?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.033
Yes.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.500
So supportive!
I love it!

03:51.567 --> 03:55.067
I'm really enjoying showing my
mam
and not missing work one bit!

04:02.700 --> 04:04.333
(phone chimes)
Hold on.

04:05.533 --> 04:09.067
It's Anna. It's time for yous
to come back to work today.

04:10.067 --> 04:12.567
Also, I'm going to be really
busy
this summer,

04:12.633 --> 04:15.433
so I've got someone
to help me run things.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.899
What the hell is going on?

04:16.966 --> 04:20.333
I hope whoever's helping Anna
is a bloke and he's fit.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.967
Bring it on. I cannot wait
to catch up with the others.

04:29.433 --> 04:33.100
Work might suck, but I am
buzzing
to get back into that house.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.867
Oh, yeah, I like that one.
I look French.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.333
Chloe, howay, man!

04:39.667 --> 04:40.733
Chlo?

04:41.733 --> 04:43.400
Are you joking?

04:43.467 --> 04:47.167
Leaving my three-bed house
is going to be so depressing.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.200
But I'm so excited
to see the family,

04:49.267 --> 04:51.933
and I can't wait to see
what Anna has got in store.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I just don't understand
Anna's new business partner.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.967
She has definitely met a toy
boy.

04:58.033 --> 05:01.900
Who the fuck has Anna been
shagging
and give a job to, to help her
out?

05:01.967 --> 05:03.400
I hope it's not some idiot.

05:04.233 --> 05:05.467
Cheers!

05:07.700 --> 05:09.200
Ah!

05:09.267 --> 05:10.933
He's back.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.667
The only reason Anna
is even giving us this job

05:14.733 --> 05:16.200
is cos she fancies us.

05:16.267 --> 05:18.500
Always has and always fucking
will.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.100
I'm a role model, you know?

05:20.167 --> 05:23.400
(laughs) Stop making us laugh!

05:23.467 --> 05:25.467
I'm not allowed
to piss in the hot tub.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.567
You wouldn't dare!

05:28.500 --> 05:30.267
Bye-bye!

05:31.533 --> 05:33.667
Don't forget to tidy everything
up.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.100
I want the house spic and spam,
right?

05:36.167 --> 05:37.667
It's not spam, it's span!

05:38.967 --> 05:40.367
(grunts)

05:42.367 --> 05:44.167
We're like the three musketeers.

05:44.233 --> 05:46.933
We actually are!
Or the three Powerpuff Girls.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.733
(both laugh)

05:48.800 --> 05:52.033
This is a first for me.
Craig has never been to the
house.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.867
So it's quite sweet.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.833
Craig, slow down the brake!

05:59.800 --> 06:03.967
My Aussie romance with Alex
was exactly what I needed

06:04.033 --> 06:05.867
but meeting a lad in my hometown

06:05.933 --> 06:08.000
just feels a little bit
more serious.

06:08.067 --> 06:11.633
I want a relationship. I just
don't want to rush into
anything.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
(horn beeps)

06:17.900 --> 06:23.333
Oh, my dear God! Is that a van?
I thought it was a delivery!

06:23.400 --> 06:25.633
I understand
when there's a man in the van,

06:25.700 --> 06:28.100
but a nan in the van?
What the fuck's this?

06:28.167 --> 06:31.667
Jesus Christ,
what is my life came to?

06:32.667 --> 06:34.533
Ooh. Argh!
(gasps)

06:34.600 --> 06:37.100
Oh, my God! Nana!
(laughs)

06:37.167 --> 06:40.800
I'm sorry, Sophie.
You knocked some sense into us.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.167
Right, let's fucking do it!

06:44.233 --> 06:46.600
Whoo-hoo, baby!

06:46.667 --> 06:48.500
Fuck that, I'm not going to
work.

06:48.567 --> 06:51.467
There is absolutely no way
I can go back to work today.

06:51.533 --> 06:54.433
I've had a holiday booked
with my boyfriend.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.167
Anna's getting on.
Don't think she'll remember.

06:57.233 --> 06:58.867
I'll Voice Note now.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.700
(beeping)

07:00.767 --> 07:04.467
(Holly) "Hi, guys. I'm not going
to
be able to come back to work
today."

07:04.533 --> 07:07.067
"I'm going on holiday
with my boyfriend."

07:07.133 --> 07:09.267
"I did tell Anna
I was going part-time,

07:09.333 --> 07:12.067
but I'll be back as soon as I
can.
Love you!"

07:12.133 --> 07:15.700
But at least she's coming back
cos I didn't know if she was or
not.

07:15.767 --> 07:19.567
I can't believe that Holly
has managed to wangle part-time.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.300
I'm jealous.
I wish that I was part-time.

07:22.367 --> 07:25.467
# Back in the Toon, I want to
spoon #

07:25.533 --> 07:29.833
I'm sweating like a fat lass
outside a Greggs with no money.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.767
Is it open?
It's open, it's open.

07:38.733 --> 07:41.933
Wow, this is so trendy!
Oh, my God!

07:44.200 --> 07:48.400
Anna must be earning so much
money,
because the house looks amazing!

07:48.467 --> 07:49.833
But what the fuck is that?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.500
Is that a iced dick?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.233
Oh, my God!

07:57.100 --> 07:59.467
Being the first one
in the house is amazing,

07:59.533 --> 08:02.767
because that means you can be
the first one to claim your bed.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.300
Shut the front door!
I want this bed! Oh, my God!

08:09.900 --> 08:12.733
Oh, bloody hell,
what have you got in here?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.000
All my clothes.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.133
I'm going for a long time.
Give me a hug.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.233
There you go.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.767
Saying goodbye is never easy,
but it's something we've got to
do.

08:20.833 --> 08:25.167
But listen, have fun, be
careful,
don't do anything mad.

08:26.433 --> 08:28.933
I can't promise that.
I know. (chuckles)

08:29.000 --> 08:30.533
Enough of this mushy shit.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.332
Fuck off, take the dog,
I've gotta go see my friends.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.033
Hi, bitches!

08:35.100 --> 08:36.600
Hey!

08:36.667 --> 08:41.067
The party has arrived!
Hi, gorge, where art thou?

08:41.133 --> 08:43.667
Right, can I just say one thing?
Wow!

08:43.732 --> 08:45.800
The house is stunning!

08:45.867 --> 08:48.533
Let's just see how long
this actually lasts.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.400
The dick! Oh, fucking get away!

08:53.367 --> 08:54.467
Wet that!

08:54.533 --> 08:56.467
(laughter)

08:56.533 --> 08:57.633
Nathan!

08:57.700 --> 09:02.400
Nathan is proper going for it.
His dick skills are amazing.

09:02.467 --> 09:05.300
Oh, shit.
Look, he never spilt a drop!

09:06.900 --> 09:10.733
On the body to rock your body!
(laughter)

09:18.167 --> 09:20.633
I was only in Australia
a short amount of time,

09:20.700 --> 09:22.000
so I'm still the newbie.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.767
I need to prove to the others
that I'm crazy enough

09:24.833 --> 09:26.333
to be part of this family.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.767
(cheering)

09:29.833 --> 09:33.433
What the fuck are you wearing?
Is that the Deliveroo guy?

09:33.500 --> 09:36.833
I am so happy that Adam's back

09:36.900 --> 09:39.667
cos he's kind, he's caring
and a comfort blanket.

09:39.733 --> 09:41.733
Just a shame that I don't fancy
him.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.067
Right, first things first,
take that fucking helmet off!

09:45.133 --> 09:46.300
(laughs) Right.

09:46.367 --> 09:50.433
It's the first time I've seen
Abbie
since Australia. She's looking
well.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.967
I wouldn't mind picking up
where I've left off.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.167
I'm gonna have to go.
Oh, you off?

09:57.233 --> 10:00.500
Yeah, I've got to go.
Come here, give us a cuddle!

10:00.567 --> 10:04.533
Abbie's nana is like a bad STI.
You cannot get rid of her.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.767
And when you do, it fucking
flares back up again. Bless her.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.767
I've claimed my bed, by the way.
Whoa, whoa! Boys' bedroom! Wait!

10:14.833 --> 10:17.333
I haven't seen the boys' room!
I wanna see it!

10:19.167 --> 10:21.400
Which one's yours?
The middle one!

10:21.467 --> 10:24.233
When I entered this house
it was full of alpha males,

10:24.300 --> 10:26.267
like Gaz, Aaron and Scott.

10:26.333 --> 10:30.267
So I never thought I'd get
the double bed in the boys'
bedroom.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.700
He's going to be shagging,
so Sam in here.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.767
I tell you what you do,
you go shag in the phone box.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.833
This is my bed.

10:40.267 --> 10:42.800
(horn honks)
Chloe's he's here!

10:42.867 --> 10:44.933
Who's that?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.033
Oh, my God!

10:47.100 --> 10:49.600
(all) Hi!

10:49.667 --> 10:52.467
Chloe actually looks like
a full-on sex doll.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.500
Her tits are fucking huge.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.267
I want to see these new
bedrooms.
Go on, then.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.533
So now me and Chloe have moved
in,
we're both very adult like,

11:01.600 --> 11:04.967
so this time it should be a
breeze
living with everybody else.

11:05.033 --> 11:08.133
You should stay with the boys
and I stay with the girls.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.433
If we ever wanted hanky-panky,
we could stay with each other.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.000
I agree. This time round...
We're more mature.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.633
We've moved in together.
I'm domesticated.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.267
I wouldn't go as far as that.
I am.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.433
In Australia mine and Sam's
arguments caused tension,

11:22.500 --> 11:26.133
so this time round I want me and
the girls to be stronger than
ever.

11:32.867 --> 11:36.433
In Australia, Sam and Chloe
were always together.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.667
So this time round,
I don't think I have any faith.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.067
They live together now,
so it is different.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.733
Time will prove and tell.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.900
Sophie and Abbie are still
sceptical
on Chloe and Sam,

11:46.967 --> 11:51.167
but I think they're different
now.
They live together. That's
better.

11:51.233 --> 11:54.200
Everybody,
I'm staying with the girls.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.000
No celebrating.

11:56.067 --> 11:59.500
Chloe, I love you,
but let's just wait and see,
love.

11:59.567 --> 12:02.367
I'm staying with the boys!
(cheering)

12:02.433 --> 12:04.667
I'm glad to be back with these
lot

12:04.733 --> 12:07.867
and I can't wait for weeks and
weeks
of getting mortal

12:07.933 --> 12:10.600
and having kebabs for breakfast,
dinner and tea.

12:10.667 --> 12:13.467
But I can't help think,
what's Anna got up her sleeve?

12:13.533 --> 12:17.333
Nathan, can you catch? There's
a couple of balls coming your
way.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.967
I'm enjoying being back,

12:19.033 --> 12:21.633
but we've not got
the Aussies with us any more,

12:21.700 --> 12:25.667
which means we are going to have
to do more work and that is
shite.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.733
Hey! We are not animals!

12:29.800 --> 12:31.600
(knocks)

12:31.667 --> 12:34.300
Who the fuck is that at the
door?
I'll get it!

12:34.367 --> 12:35.900
This could be the new boss.

12:35.967 --> 12:39.067
I hope it's not cos I don't want
to go to fucking work.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.700
Hello!
(cheering)

12:41.767 --> 12:43.133
What the hell?

12:44.967 --> 12:46.067
Hello!

12:46.133 --> 12:47.733
Who the hell is she?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.500
(roars like a dinosaur)

12:49.567 --> 12:51.900
To everyone, cheers!

12:51.967 --> 12:54.200
She's picking out chunks of
food.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.433
Nathan!

12:58.500 --> 13:00.700
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:03.000 --> 13:03.200
.

13:05.700 --> 13:05.900
.

13:12.133 --> 13:15.100
Hello!
(all) Hi!

13:15.167 --> 13:18.067
Who the hell is she?
Who's that?

13:18.133 --> 13:20.233
Fuck me, she's orange!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.733
Hello, I'm Faith!
Hi, Faith.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.567
This new girl looks mint.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.367
(all exchange greetings)

13:27.433 --> 13:29.633
Hello! Oh, I love your outfit!

13:29.700 --> 13:33.133
She's a cute, small bundle
of absolute joy.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.267
I've got a question to ask you.
Are you our new boss or not?

13:36.333 --> 13:39.067
Yeah, I am. I'm coming to take
over.

13:39.133 --> 13:41.167
No, of course not!

13:41.233 --> 13:44.400
My name's Faith. Anna's gave us
a call to come join the team.

13:44.467 --> 13:48.833
I can't put words on it,
how excited I am. This is...

13:48.900 --> 13:51.033
(screams, laughs)

13:51.100 --> 13:53.133
Everyone, I think
we should do a shot.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.467
I'll drink yous all under the
table.
Go on, fucking do it!

13:56.533 --> 13:58.833
Show her how it's done!
Prove it.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.533
(all chant) Drink!

14:01.600 --> 14:03.700
I've only been here two minutes

14:03.767 --> 14:06.833
and I've got my mouth
round a giant willy. Sorry, Mam!

14:06.900 --> 14:08.467
Are you buzzing?
So excited.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.433
I think you are going to be
crazy.
I'm so fucking crazy!

14:11.500 --> 14:12.667
I'm absolutely mad.

14:12.733 --> 14:15.633
She has got so much energy
and I love energy,

14:15.700 --> 14:17.533
especially energy drinks.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.467
This girl has got confidence
for days.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.300
She is going to fit in
perfectly.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.167
God, you've got big fucking
tits!

14:32.233 --> 14:34.367
Big tits, totally natural.
Can I feel?

14:34.433 --> 14:36.967
Have a feel.
You did it before you asked!

14:37.033 --> 14:39.033
I'm not a lesbian!
Don't worry!

14:45.333 --> 14:49.300
Are you excited to be here?
Ooh, look at these lights!

14:49.367 --> 14:50.733
What's in here?

14:54.333 --> 14:55.933
Oh, shit.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.567
(shouts)

14:59.333 --> 15:02.367
Chloe, that's awful.
I love it. I fucking love that,
me.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.000
I love anything bejazzled.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.767
I'm so excited
to be unpacking with the girls.

15:06.833 --> 15:10.100
Especially Chloe. I really hope
we can become good friends.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.533
Honestly, we have so many
funny moments,

15:12.600 --> 15:14.133
all drunk, eating kebabs.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.967
Do you like kebab?
Vegetarian.

15:16.033 --> 15:17.600
What?
No, I'm serious!

15:17.667 --> 15:20.400
I love chicken nuggets.
I just don't eat them.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.500
What the fuck does she do with
them?

15:22.567 --> 15:24.833
I've never, ever
met a vegetarian before.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.067
It's nice to meet you.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.667
(roars like a dinosaur)

15:32.133 --> 15:34.300
The banter with the lads
is next level.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.067
It's like we're already in the
club,
but we're not even ready yet!

15:45.400 --> 15:47.533
I fucking love that new girl.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.133
It's the first time
I've ever seen a girl come in

15:50.200 --> 15:52.300
and the girls
take to her straight away.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.867
Normally there's a bit of...
is it animosity?

15:54.933 --> 15:56.600
That's a big word for you.

15:56.667 --> 16:01.467
I love upfront and confident
people
and that's why I like Faith.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.033
Make me a drink
while I put my setting spray on.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.000
What's a setting spray?
Makes your face stay on.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.600
(chuckles) Makes your face stay
on!

16:15.767 --> 16:19.367
Faith, you're looking very nice.
You're making me look pale.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.967
Oh, oh, there she is!

16:22.033 --> 16:23.767
Give me an iron, I'm creased.

16:23.833 --> 16:28.200
I cannot believe that Chloe
Ferry
is going to iron my shorts.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.700
Who would have thought it?

16:29.767 --> 16:33.467
Do you even know how to put it
up?
Yeah, I'm just struggling a bit.

16:33.533 --> 16:37.067
Chloe should not be allowed
anywhere near an iron.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.700
She thinks
she's this domesticated goddess,

16:39.767 --> 16:41.933
but she'll probably
burn the house down.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.933
Hey, hello?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.900
Faith, this is your first night
out.
I'm so excited.

16:46.967 --> 16:49.600
I can't wait for yous all to...
What do you expect?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.867
I don't think I've got
expectations.
It's going to be wild.

16:52.933 --> 16:56.767
When people first come in they
always make a tit out of
themselves.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.700
The first night.
Gonna make a tit out of
yourself?

16:59.767 --> 17:02.200
I make a tit out of myself
all the time.

17:02.267 --> 17:03.700
What's that I can smell?

17:03.767 --> 17:06.833
It smells like burned polyester.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.000
Is that my shorts?!

17:09.067 --> 17:11.367
Are you joking me?
You've burnt the cunt!

17:11.433 --> 17:12.767
Where?

17:12.833 --> 17:15.400
Oh, my God!
I didn't do that.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.099
They've actually melted!

17:17.166 --> 17:20.067
Howay, then. Let's go out!

17:21.500 --> 17:23.599
I am well up for tonight.

17:23.666 --> 17:26.032
Got a new girl.
We're back in Newcastle.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.200
It's going to be fucking mint.

17:28.267 --> 17:30.233
To the family night and Faith!

17:30.300 --> 17:31.667
To you.
To Faith!

17:31.733 --> 17:33.367
(all cheer) To Faith!

17:33.433 --> 17:34.833
To the family!

17:34.900 --> 17:36.967
Howay, let's get fucking mortal!

17:38.367 --> 17:40.867
Tonight is a big one.

17:40.933 --> 17:44.000
We need to start this off
with a fucking bang.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.800
(cheering)

17:57.733 --> 18:01.767
We have just got to Tup Tup
and this is our first night out.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.033
I am raring to go.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.167
So, let's have a family night.
To everyone, cheers!

18:20.800 --> 18:23.567
I can't describe how happy I am
that Adam's here.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.267
Chloe will get jealous!

18:53.433 --> 18:55.167
I've never had a relationship,

18:55.233 --> 18:58.100
but hanging around Chloe and Sam
makes us want one.

18:58.167 --> 18:59.800
It'd be a bonus if it was Abbie.

19:16.033 --> 19:20.200
It's my first night out with
this lot
and I am having a fucking great
time.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.900
Faith seams really fun and
bubbly

19:30.967 --> 19:32.833
and I cannot wait
to get to know her.

19:42.633 --> 19:45.633
I love being back at this house,
especially with Nathan.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.500
He's my best friend.
I wouldn't have it any other
way.

19:57.067 --> 20:00.633
I'm so glad that Chloe hasn't
been
clinging to Sam all night.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.733
I hope she ends up
in the girls' room.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.267
I'm so happy that Sophie and
Abbie
are feeling better about Chloe.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.633
Hopefully, everyone will stay
happy
and there will be peace.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.300
I've missed having a giggle
and a flirt with Adam on a
night.

20:41.367 --> 20:44.100
It's just fun and that works for
me.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.667
I am thick as fuck, but I know
when two people are flirting.

20:58.733 --> 21:00.900
Adam and Abbie
are all over each other.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.033
Faith is absolutely buzzing.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.167
I've not seen dancing like that
since Chloe had ten pints.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.367
She fits right in.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.000
I remember my first day in the
house

21:19.067 --> 21:21.633
and I was absolutely
cacking my pants.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.133
To be fair to Faith,
she's fucking smashed it!

21:28.567 --> 21:31.200
There's something
I need to tell them.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.167
I hope it doesn't change their
mind.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.467
I don't know about the liver
of a giant,

21:43.533 --> 21:47.033
but she's got the tits of one.
I just hope she can handle her
pee.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.800
Drinks, whoo!

21:56.933 --> 21:59.267
I'm trying to keep up,
but I take it all back.

21:59.333 --> 22:02.267
I'm really struggling.
These guys can drink.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.433
Faith looks like
she's had one too many.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.900
The girl looks like
she's about to be sick.

22:07.967 --> 22:09.867
(wretches)

22:11.133 --> 22:14.100
Poor Faith,
she's picking out chunks of
food,

22:14.167 --> 22:16.767
but to be fair, we've all done
it.

22:21.233 --> 22:24.400
Faith has just rustled up
a tomato soup in the club.

22:24.467 --> 22:27.233
I just wish I could rustle up
some chicken nuggets!

22:27.300 --> 22:29.233
We're going!
Come on, we're going!

22:29.300 --> 22:32.300
We are all getting
a little bit too drunk.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.500
We need to get home now
before we're thrown out of Tup
Tup.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.233
Nathan! Nathan!

22:55.167 --> 22:57.833
The spew in the club
has really sobered us up a bit.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.467
I can't believe I went too hard
on my first night.

23:01.633 --> 23:03.600
(laughter)

23:03.667 --> 23:06.033
Faith's gone to bed early
on her first night.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.667
She's more of a lightweight
than she thought.

23:10.933 --> 23:13.233
No! Nathan!

23:13.300 --> 23:16.800
Nathan!
Oh, Nathan!

23:16.867 --> 23:20.700
I can't believe Nathan's already
turned the kitchen into an ice
rink.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.900
On a serious note,
it's our first night back.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.400
I'm gonna go in the hot tub,
have a drink. Anyone joining me?

23:27.467 --> 23:30.533
Of course I'm getting
in the hot tub! I love this guy.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.033
What are you drinking?
I'm having a...

23:33.100 --> 23:35.267
What you drinking?
Noodles and chips.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.633
Bella-coo! Bella-la-la-coo!

23:40.133 --> 23:42.400
I love winding Nathan up
when he's drunk.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.867
He is like a piece of string
and I am the cat.

23:44.933 --> 23:46.533
I can't stop playing with him.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.067
(shouts)

23:49.133 --> 23:50.933
What's that noise?
Look, look.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.267
Nathan's the king of this house,
isn't he?

23:53.333 --> 23:54.633
Yeah.
Really?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.667
It's good being back with the
girls,

23:56.733 --> 24:00.100
but right now I've had enough
of them, so I'm going to bed.

24:03.667 --> 24:07.000
I am mortal. I don't know how
I'm going to get out of the hot
tub,

24:07.067 --> 24:09.667
let alone them stairs going to
bed.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.967
Where's fucking... chicken
nugget?

24:18.867 --> 24:21.933
Night one has been a success,
the new girl has fitted in,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.467
and I'm shitfaced,
getting fed noodles by Adam.

24:25.533 --> 24:27.933
I just wonder
what Anna's got in store for us.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.867
Goodnight, lads. Love yous.
Love you!

24:32.200 --> 24:34.567
(retches)
(laughter)

24:34.633 --> 24:36.500
Shall I do it?
If you want to, babe.

24:36.567 --> 24:37.900
I enjoyed that.
Yeah?

24:37.967 --> 24:40.167
Long time no fucking see!

24:40.233 --> 24:43.533
Oh, my God, it's Scott!

24:46.500 --> 24:48.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:51.467 --> 24:51.667
.

24:54.167 --> 24:54.367
.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.967
Good morning, girls.

25:12.033 --> 25:15.567
Rise and shine, bitches!

25:15.633 --> 25:18.367
I love having Chloe
back in the girls' room,

25:18.433 --> 25:21.567
but I cannot stand this racket
first thing in the morning.

25:21.633 --> 25:23.900
So, Faith, did you have
a good first night?

25:23.967 --> 25:26.600
It was fucking mint.
I can't believe I was sick.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.067
How embarrassing.

25:28.133 --> 25:31.700
So I've woke up this morning
and my head is absolutely
banging.

25:31.767 --> 25:34.267
I made a right tit of myself
last night.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.967
I did think that I would have
been able to keep up with yous

25:38.033 --> 25:39.133
better than I did.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.333
We've all been there. I mean,
I pissed myself and was sick,

25:42.400 --> 25:44.733
and Holly held my hair
on my first night.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.933
We've all been there.
Yeah, it's the fashion to be
sick.

25:50.033 --> 25:52.867
(yawns) My God.

25:52.933 --> 25:54.367
Last night was epic.

25:54.433 --> 25:58.300
The boys' bond in this house
hasn't
been this tight for a very long
time

25:58.367 --> 26:00.000
and I am fucking loving it.

26:00.067 --> 26:02.300
I'm the sausage
and yous are the sandwich.

26:02.367 --> 26:05.933
You're one bun and you're the
other.
Do you gently slip inside us?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I greasily slip inside, honey.
(laughter)

26:09.067 --> 26:13.200
Here she is. Here she comes,
Freddy fucking Krueger.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.300
Morning, bitch.

26:14.367 --> 26:18.967
Why are you wearing Christmas
pyjamas? I've got Christmas
spirit.

26:19.033 --> 26:22.767
Although it was absolutely
fantastic
sleeping in the girls' room,

26:22.833 --> 26:25.000
I still need cuddles with my
Sam.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.233
Watch this. Every morning I do
this.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.900
I go, "Good morning!"

26:29.967 --> 26:32.700
Why are you pulling that face?
I'm having an orgasm.

26:32.767 --> 26:35.700
Right, let's get up.
We'll go and make some
breakfast.

26:35.767 --> 26:38.867
Faith might be the newbie
but I'm pretty new as well,

26:38.933 --> 26:42.167
so I'm gonna make some breakfast
for everyone.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.633
Are you my best friend still?
You are my best mate.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.400
Do you think it's going to get
to where you and Adam,

26:49.467 --> 26:50.733
he's your best friend?

26:50.800 --> 26:54.467
This is what I'm saying.
Are you worried about that? Nah.

26:54.533 --> 26:57.233
Sam and Adam
are spending a lot of time
together.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.567
I'm happy he's making friends,
but he better not forget me.

27:00.633 --> 27:02.633
He can't give you
what I can give you.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.100
I've got a good-looking fanny.
He hasn't.

27:05.167 --> 27:08.300
He's got a bad hair receding
line.
He needs a transplant.

27:08.367 --> 27:09.767
(laughs)

27:14.433 --> 27:17.067
You deal with the bacon.
Adam, put the bacon in.

27:17.133 --> 27:19.900
How do you do that?
(both laugh)

27:23.433 --> 27:26.200
No, Adam, unravel it.
Hold on, then.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.933
How the fuck do I do that?
How are you this thick?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.667
I don't know how Adam has made
it
this far in life.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.300
The boy is thick as pig shit.

27:34.367 --> 27:36.400
What you doing with the knife?

27:36.467 --> 27:38.000
Adam!
What?

27:38.067 --> 27:40.733
Right.
I'm not a good cook. I cannot
cook.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.700
Do you cook at home or not?
Never.

27:42.767 --> 27:46.333
I can't even spell "breakfast",
never mind cook the fucker.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.867
Are you having a tea break?
You haven't done fuck all.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.767
Yous lot! Breakfast!

27:56.833 --> 27:58.600
I'm fucking starving.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.367
I am so happy
to be back with this lot.

28:01.433 --> 28:05.433
I've got a hangover from hell,
but
a family fry up will sort this
out.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.433
Nathan's been bossing me around
this morning,

28:12.500 --> 28:14.933
so we whack chilli powder
in his breakfast.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.733
Everyone's got a nice little
lovely
blackcurrant, to give yous...

28:18.800 --> 28:20.500
I want a fucking cup of tea!

28:20.567 --> 28:23.067
No, blackcurrant,
cos you need to hydrate.

28:23.133 --> 28:25.233
It's pretty surreal sitting here

28:25.300 --> 28:28.767
with a load of new people
in a strange house, but I like
it.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.533
(retches, coughs)

28:33.600 --> 28:35.600
(both laugh)

28:37.200 --> 28:39.300
Is that nice?
That nice?

28:39.367 --> 28:42.233
Fuck's sake,
those cheeky little bastards.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.167
(both laugh)

28:47.400 --> 28:49.667
(gasps) Who's that?
Ah!

28:49.733 --> 28:51.500
What you done?

28:51.567 --> 28:53.433
Oh...

28:56.467 --> 28:58.967
I'm gonna get my suitcase now
and fuck Anna off.

28:59.033 --> 29:02.300
I'm taking the watermelon
cushions.
I want the kiwi cushion.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.367
What else can I steal?

29:04.433 --> 29:07.000
Hi, welcome back.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.067
Anna's here!
Where is everyone?

29:09.133 --> 29:10.600
Fucking hell.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.367
You look you're in the navy.

29:12.433 --> 29:14.500
Anna looks like she owns a
yacht.

29:14.567 --> 29:16.733
Us lot are making her
far too much money.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.400
Looks like a sailor.
Welcome to the family, Faith.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.633
Thanks, Anna.
How was your first night?

29:22.700 --> 29:27.467
Absolutely amazing.
Looks like it was pretty
amazing.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.933
Howay, Anna. Cut to the chase
before we're all as old as you
are.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.800
Who is your new business
partner?

29:32.867 --> 29:35.567
(tapping)
Who? At the door?

29:35.633 --> 29:38.233
Who the fuck is
going to walk through that door?

29:38.300 --> 29:41.633
Long time no fucking see!
(cheering)

29:41.700 --> 29:45.167
Oh, my God, it's Scott!

29:45.233 --> 29:46.767
How you fucking feeling?

29:46.833 --> 29:49.400
Newcastle's biggest arsehole
is back in the mix

29:49.467 --> 29:51.167
and he's landed a promotion.

29:51.233 --> 29:52.867
Who are you and who are you?

29:52.933 --> 29:55.700
Scott has not been in this house
for a very long time.

29:55.767 --> 29:58.367
Last time he was here,
he was getting with Abbie.

29:58.433 --> 30:00.267
Scott, how are you?
Hello, kid.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.333
I'm absolutely splendid.
All right?

30:02.400 --> 30:05.333
All right, babes?
Shit, I nearly took your eyeball
out.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.967
When I was with Scott,
he broke my heart,

30:08.033 --> 30:10.533
but now I'm seeing him,
I don't feel anything.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.533
I am loving this stronger side
of me.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.933
So wait, wait, wait,
let us get this right.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.433
Scott is the new boss?

30:16.500 --> 30:18.667
Oh, yeah.
Scott's gonna be helping.

30:18.733 --> 30:22.267
I want you to treat him with the
utmost respect, like you do for
me.

30:22.333 --> 30:25.133
Scott must be putting
in a good shift or shaft in Anna

30:25.200 --> 30:27.867
to be getting a job.
What the fuck is going on?

30:27.933 --> 30:31.500
You do what you need to do.
Keep me happy, it keeps Anna
happy.

30:31.567 --> 30:32.733
Then we're all happy!

30:32.800 --> 30:35.300
I cannot wait to boss
these tatties about,

30:35.367 --> 30:37.333
Lucky for them, no work today,

30:37.400 --> 30:39.767
but Scotty T
has got a surprise up his
sleeve.

30:39.833 --> 30:42.767
I'm gonna introduce you
to some new family members.

30:42.833 --> 30:46.200
New housemates.
I can't wait to meet them.

30:46.267 --> 30:48.633
I think yous will get on just
well.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.800
Fish! It's a fish!

30:52.633 --> 30:55.367
(screaming)

30:55.433 --> 30:56.467
Hello!

30:56.533 --> 30:58.200
Urgh! That is disgusting.

30:58.267 --> 31:01.667
Getting these rats off Scott
is such a good present.

31:01.733 --> 31:04.867
This is perfect practice for
when me and Sam have kids.

31:04.933 --> 31:07.567
Chloe, don't get them out.
Don't touch them, man.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.300
They'll thrive in here.
It's a fucking shithole.

31:10.367 --> 31:12.133
I haven't seen these lot in ages

31:12.200 --> 31:15.333
and nothing brings family
together
better than a pet.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.433
(gasps) Chloe!
Urgh!

31:17.500 --> 31:18.833
I cannot stand rats!

31:18.900 --> 31:21.367
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, chop,
chop!

31:21.433 --> 31:24.167
Don't you fucking start now.

31:24.233 --> 31:25.800
Living with Scott was hell.

31:25.867 --> 31:28.433
But going to work for him
is even worse.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.633
Good luck, lads and lasses.
See you, you little mugs.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.067
Whey!
Bye, boss.

31:34.133 --> 31:36.533
Scott's fit
and he seems like a nice lad.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.033
I'm pretty excited.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.667
I quit!
I quit, I quit, I quit, I quit!

31:40.733 --> 31:44.200
Fuck Anna! Fuck Scott!
Fuck the fucking job!

31:44.267 --> 31:46.633
Take your fucking apple
and fuck off!

31:52.600 --> 31:55.467
Go on, rats. I mean yous rats!

31:55.533 --> 31:56.967
Get your rat out!

31:57.033 --> 31:58.267
Fanny rat.
Fanny rat.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.800
Chloe, this is your scene.

31:59.867 --> 32:02.467
I'll do it, I'm an animal lover.
I'll watch on by.

32:03.867 --> 32:05.933
Yous, what we going to call
them?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.900
We should call them
Donald Trump and Theresa May.

32:08.967 --> 32:11.467
Me and my mam
have got an obsession with
Trump.

32:11.533 --> 32:15.167
He's just got something about
him.
He's got lovely tanned skin,

32:15.233 --> 32:16.967
orange and tanned ginger hair.

32:17.033 --> 32:19.933
He's fucking lush.
I'd shag him if I wasn't with
Sam.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.900
Parliament house.
Political.

32:21.967 --> 32:25.833
Fuck knows how Chloe has came up
with political names for these
rats,

32:25.900 --> 32:29.133
she cannot even spell
"politics",
man, never mind...

32:29.200 --> 32:31.133
"Politics"? (laughs)

32:31.200 --> 32:32.233
That rat's a twat.

32:32.300 --> 32:34.700
I'm being serious,
these are our priority.

32:34.767 --> 32:37.633
We need to get the practice in
for the kids. What kids?

32:37.700 --> 32:39.400
We'll have kids one day
When?

32:39.467 --> 32:41.000
You need to make them first!

32:41.067 --> 32:42.833
This is going to be difficult.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.467
I'd love, look after
and probably bath our kids.

32:45.533 --> 32:46.833
I can't bath a rat.

32:46.900 --> 32:50.767
Come here, give them some scran.
Howay, fat bastards!

32:58.433 --> 33:01.933
Since I've been in this house,
I've had no time to myself to
reflect

33:02.000 --> 33:04.433
and it's something
I really like to do.

33:09.567 --> 33:10.900
What you doing?

33:10.967 --> 33:13.200
Just having a moment to myself.

33:13.267 --> 33:14.300
You all right?

33:14.367 --> 33:17.667
This is a bit awkward, but I'm
not
going to shy away from it.

33:17.733 --> 33:20.633
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.000
I like to take some time out
to talk to Jesus.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.467
Shut up, really?!

33:24.533 --> 33:27.367
Oh, my God, I wasn't expecting
that!

33:27.433 --> 33:29.433
What do you do
when you talk to Jesus?

33:29.500 --> 33:32.233
He's my little pal.
I talk to him throughout the
day.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.533
Just like, "Hey, Jesus, what's
up?"

33:34.600 --> 33:36.433
Does it work?
I think so.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.300
Don't know how I'd have
got through life without him.

33:39.367 --> 33:43.500
Do you actually sit and pray?
Yeah. I don't kneel down or
anything.

33:43.567 --> 33:44.700
Shall I do it?

33:44.767 --> 33:46.300
If you want to do it, babe.
OK.

33:46.367 --> 33:50.200
Should I close my eyes?
You do whatever feels
comfortable.

33:50.267 --> 33:52.633
This is something
really personal to me.

33:52.700 --> 33:56.867
Some people can be weirded out
by it,
but Nathan is really cool.

33:56.933 --> 33:59.567
Then at the end can I say amen?
Yeah, amen.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.367
It's just good, isn't it?
It's like having a friend to
talk to.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.433
I enjoyed that. It's different.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.867
It's nice and peaceful
just to take a moment

34:08.933 --> 34:10.867
and know there's someone there.

34:10.933 --> 34:13.766
I feel enlightened.
Amazing!

34:13.833 --> 34:16.632
I know what it's like to come in
and be different,

34:16.699 --> 34:19.033
so I'll always respect
Faith's beliefs.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.632
Go back inside? It's freezing.
I'm fucking freezing.

34:22.699 --> 34:25.533
I was like, "What you doing?"
"I'm talking to Jesus."

34:25.600 --> 34:26.667
What?

34:26.733 --> 34:28.500
A Christian living with us lot?

34:37.667 --> 34:39.667
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

34:41.933 --> 34:42.132
.

34:44.667 --> 34:44.867
.

34:52.867 --> 34:54.100
Argh!

34:58.900 --> 35:00.767
(laughter)

35:06.467 --> 35:09.600
What's that? Why have you
pushed them up so high?

35:09.667 --> 35:13.033
Cos it's how you wear pants
nowadays.
It's called vintage.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.133
Vintage? It's called squished.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.067
Me and the lads are getting
ready and
I need to tell the boys about
Faith.

35:19.133 --> 35:20.767
I need to get it off my chest.

35:20.833 --> 35:25.400
I was like, "What are you
doing?"
She was like, "I'm talking to
Jesus."

35:25.467 --> 35:27.800
She's very religious.
What?

35:27.867 --> 35:30.800
No, yous, come on,
I don't want to take the mick

35:30.867 --> 35:32.700
cos it's quite a sensitive
thing.

35:32.767 --> 35:35.500
A full-on Christian
living with us lot?

35:35.567 --> 35:38.700
Can't wait to tell Chloe!
Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys!

35:38.767 --> 35:40.467
For the lads!

35:41.600 --> 35:44.767
I've got to tell you something.
You know the rats outside?

35:44.833 --> 35:47.033
They're practice for our kids.
Right.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.167
Sam hates them.
Sam hates them.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.633
Who would call the kids
Donald and Theresa?

35:51.700 --> 35:53.167
That's a bit cruel, Chloe.

35:53.233 --> 35:57.033
I know Theresa May and Donald
Trump
are not really mine and Sam's
bairns,

35:57.100 --> 35:58.233
but it feels good.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.667
I've got a house, kids,
I'm all grown up!

36:00.733 --> 36:04.333
Are you going to go on the pull?
We'll go see what talent's out.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.167
If yous do get back here and you
don't pull, right, meet my
friend.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.567
Daryl the dildo.

36:10.833 --> 36:13.033
Girls?
Howay, then.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.233
Come on, girls!

36:14.300 --> 36:17.633
I know in my mind,
in my soul and in my vagina,

36:17.700 --> 36:20.433
tonight is going to be
brilliant.
Get me to the club!

36:20.500 --> 36:23.967
Cheers, howay, everyone!
All the fucking best! All the
best!

36:24.033 --> 36:25.267
Merry Christmas!

36:36.500 --> 36:40.533
Tonight, I am on a mission
to get fucking legless.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.967
Newcastle doesn't know
what's about to fucking hit it.

36:44.033 --> 36:45.200
Cheers!

36:46.667 --> 36:49.167
(shouting)

37:00.300 --> 37:03.367
I'm up for tonight. Know what
would make it more special?

37:03.433 --> 37:05.500
Getting a cheeky neck-on off
Abbie.

37:27.733 --> 37:29.600
Ah, Jesus!

37:29.667 --> 37:31.433
As in Jesus, Jesus!

37:31.500 --> 37:32.533
I get you.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.267
I can't believe
that Faith is religious.

37:44.333 --> 37:48.367
I have never had a religious
friend.
I cannot wait to know more about
it.

38:08.367 --> 38:12.500
I feel like I'm gonna learn a
lot,
maybe get a chemistry with God.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.233
I'm loving life at the minute.

38:38.300 --> 38:42.433
Chloe's hanging out with the
girls,
I'm with the boys. Life is mint.

38:46.567 --> 38:48.333
I have got an amazing idea.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.333
I am very proud of mine
and Sam's new house,

38:51.400 --> 38:54.300
so why don't we invite
the family around?

38:59.200 --> 39:00.633
For the first time,

39:00.700 --> 39:02.767
Chloe Ferry's come up
with a good idea.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.667
Show the family our home.

39:16.533 --> 39:18.533
(cheering)

39:20.333 --> 39:23.800
I'm having such a good time.
I'm feeling happy about being
single

39:23.867 --> 39:27.433
and I'm enjoying spending time
with this crazy family.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.100
Go faster!

39:32.167 --> 39:33.800
(laughs)

39:33.867 --> 39:38.300
I know I said I wanted to get
close
to Chloe, but sitting on her
face?

39:38.367 --> 39:40.133
I think that's taking it a bit
far.

39:48.867 --> 39:50.467
Abbie's looking well, mind.

39:50.533 --> 39:52.067
Adam, it's show time

39:59.933 --> 40:01.267
This is awkward.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.100
I have had a few boozy neck-ons,

40:03.167 --> 40:07.000
but I just want Adam as a friend
who
I can have a laugh with and
cuddle,

40:07.067 --> 40:08.067
nothing more.

40:14.633 --> 40:15.633
Adam!

40:15.700 --> 40:18.467
Adam just tried to kiss us.
This is weird.

40:22.767 --> 40:26.800
For fuck's sake, talk about
barking
up the wrong tree. I'm howling
up!

40:43.800 --> 40:45.867
This has been a classic
Geordie night.

40:45.933 --> 40:49.633
Fuck loads of drink, we're
all mortal. It's time to get
back.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.300
Hi, friend!

40:52.467 --> 40:54.067
He is not well.

40:54.133 --> 40:56.167
Nathan and Abbie
are as pissed as me.

40:56.233 --> 40:59.300
It's going to be interesting
when we get back to the house

41:05.000 --> 41:06.900
(cheering)

41:06.967 --> 41:08.633
(shouts)

41:08.700 --> 41:12.400
I feel like I've well and truly
let my hair down, you know, Sam.

41:12.467 --> 41:14.233
You don't really have much hair.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.533
Give me the fucking chicken!

41:16.600 --> 41:19.367
They're fucking good chips,
them!

41:19.433 --> 41:23.367
Thanks fuck for take-away
cos us pigs are going in.

41:23.433 --> 41:25.733
I'm going to make
the executive decision

41:25.800 --> 41:29.433
that I want all my family
members
around my house,

41:29.500 --> 41:31.300
for a nice dinner party.

41:31.367 --> 41:32.933
(cheering)

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm well excited to see
Sam and Chloe's new home.

41:36.067 --> 41:38.067
We just can't wreck it
like we do here.

41:40.033 --> 41:43.067
I can't believe how mortal Abbie
is.

41:43.133 --> 41:46.500
She has got that look on her
face
what spells trouble.

41:46.567 --> 41:49.333
(shouts)
This jacket's expensive!

41:49.400 --> 41:50.933
Stop that!
(screams)

41:51.000 --> 41:52.400
No, no!

41:55.100 --> 41:56.133
Stop it!

41:56.200 --> 41:59.700
Right, Abbie, if you want a war,
it's a war you will fucking get.

42:04.267 --> 42:06.533
(screams)

42:06.600 --> 42:07.867
Nathan!

42:09.267 --> 42:12.933
Abbie only threw one chip
and now Nathan has thrown Faith,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.633
food and the fucking whole house
in the air.

42:15.700 --> 42:19.567
I fucking hate food fights.
Straight to bed.

42:19.633 --> 42:22.900
I have spent way to long
on my curls and my contour

42:22.967 --> 42:26.400
to get it ruined tonight. Come
on,
you lot, get yourselves to bed.

42:30.867 --> 42:35.367
Everyone's getting ready for bed
and truth be told, I'm pretty
horny,

42:35.433 --> 42:37.233
so I'm going to use the dildo.

42:37.300 --> 42:40.267
What the fuck's going on in
here?

42:40.333 --> 42:43.133
Let me move in there.
Get the oil on you.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.667
(laughter)

42:44.733 --> 42:46.733
I don't mind greasing the
wheels,

42:46.800 --> 42:48.900
but that is not a train
I want to ride.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.967
It's time for me to get to bed.

42:52.233 --> 42:53.967
What the hell is going on?

42:54.033 --> 42:57.167
Come here, pal, let your best
mate
give you a hand.

42:57.233 --> 42:59.900
Oh, it's died!
Keep that cunt away from me!

43:04.000 --> 43:06.467
Where's Faith?

43:06.533 --> 43:08.433
Faith?
You all right, Faith?

43:11.667 --> 43:14.600
Faith, welcome to the family.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.600
I've don't think we've got any
food.

43:16.667 --> 43:19.733
Chloe might think she's grown
up,
but she needs her mam.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.767
This dinner party looks like a
Come Dine with Me for
four-year-olds.

43:24.833 --> 43:26.700
So good to catch up with James.

43:30.033 --> 43:33.367
Here she is, the love of my
life,
covered in mud.

43:33.433 --> 43:35.833
Have you finally had sex?
Faith, get lost!

43:35.900 --> 43:37.533
Are you hungover?
Yes. Great!

43:37.600 --> 43:41.167
This Geordie squad is about to
get
a belter of an education

43:41.233 --> 43:43.767
I dare you. Deep throat!

43:43.833 --> 43:46.900
I thought Chloe and I were
getting along. I'm not going to!
