00:56.880 --> 00:58.690
ELIZABETH: <i>All right, here's the plan.</i>

00:58.691 --> 01:01.125
I... am going to eat

01:01.126 --> 01:03.795
and hydrate like crazy

01:03.796 --> 01:06.464
until sunrise.

01:06.465 --> 01:10.235
Surf <i>that</i> wave till around 10:30,

01:10.236 --> 01:11.970
when I will become

01:11.971 --> 01:14.405
very hungry and thirsty.

01:14.406 --> 01:17.375
Not to mention edgy
from lack of caffeine.

01:17.376 --> 01:18.977
Thanks for that.

01:18.978 --> 01:22.247
Then, you know, I'll just
ride it out till sundown.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.749
My guests and I will...

01:24.750 --> 01:28.853
break the fast and commence
iftar dinner by eating

01:28.854 --> 01:31.322
the traditional three dates.

01:31.323 --> 01:35.226
At which point, informed by a
tiny bit of personal experience,

01:35.227 --> 01:38.396
I'll give a few remarks about Ramadan.

01:38.397 --> 01:41.399
You know, you could talk about the
mental and spiritual fortitude

01:41.400 --> 01:43.001
it requires, the...

01:43.002 --> 01:45.737
the solidarity it engenders
with the hungry and deprived

01:45.738 --> 01:47.872
- around the world.
- And then...

01:47.873 --> 01:50.141
I can stuff my face
with a bunch of kabobs.

01:50.142 --> 01:51.309
(CHUCKLES)

01:51.310 --> 01:53.076
Yeah, easy-peasy.

01:55.213 --> 01:57.448
You don't think I can make it.

01:57.449 --> 02:00.952
Dare I bring up the infamous
Florida road trip of aught-six?

02:00.953 --> 02:03.021
Not if you want to have
sex in the next month.

02:03.022 --> 02:06.457
H-Hey, hey, I...
if you want, go for it,

02:06.458 --> 02:08.359
but I'm just saying
if things get hairy,

02:08.360 --> 02:10.360
don't be a martyr... no pun intended.

02:10.362 --> 02:13.231
Do you know who held the
first iftar in Washington?

02:13.232 --> 02:14.565
Thomas Jefferson, 1805.

02:14.566 --> 02:15.833
That's right.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.770
- Do you know what Jefferson <i>didn't</i> do?
- Fast.

02:18.771 --> 02:19.971
That's right.

02:19.972 --> 02:23.047
Which means that I am about to outdo

02:23.048 --> 02:26.016
one of our Founding Fathers.

02:26.017 --> 02:29.285
Why don't you chew on that, Jefferson.

02:29.987 --> 02:31.622
What are you doing?

02:31.623 --> 02:33.724
Buddy system... we'll fast together.

02:33.725 --> 02:36.894
I really scared you with that
no-sex comment, didn't I?

02:36.895 --> 02:39.096
(CHUCKLES) Just eat your eggs.

02:39.097 --> 02:40.563
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

02:42.266 --> 02:43.601
No.

02:43.602 --> 02:45.770
- No, no, no.
- Okay, I-I know that you're fasting.

02:45.771 --> 02:49.106
- I just wanted to be sure...
- That I wasn't going to bail?

02:49.107 --> 02:52.476
(LAUGHS): You know, I'm starting
to think those closest to me

02:52.477 --> 02:54.412
really don't know me at all.

02:54.413 --> 02:57.348
It's just, you know I don't
like to be caught up short.

02:57.349 --> 03:00.451
I do. And I wanted to talk
to you about exactly that.

03:00.452 --> 03:02.620
But... first, to be clear,

03:02.621 --> 03:05.256
that's the last I want
to see of that today.

03:05.257 --> 03:06.757
No purse muffin?

03:06.758 --> 03:08.559
Oh. Enjoy it. Thanks.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.927
Okay, about the iftar.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.062
Uh, yes. Jay is into the final details

03:12.063 --> 03:13.831
with the Chief of Protocol's Office.

03:13.832 --> 03:15.900
I want you to take over.

03:15.901 --> 03:17.268
Oh.

03:17.269 --> 03:18.636
Okay, sure.

03:18.637 --> 03:19.804
Uh...

03:19.805 --> 03:21.238
is this because Jay thinks

03:21.239 --> 03:23.073
Cyril and his team are too uptight?

03:23.074 --> 03:25.209
Because I personally think
all they're trying to do

03:25.210 --> 03:27.945
is get critical details right
to better facilitate diplomacy.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.281
I mean, if that makes
them sniffy, then...

03:30.282 --> 03:32.683
- call me sniffy, too.
- Which is why

03:32.684 --> 03:35.686
I think that you would make
a great fit over there.

03:35.687 --> 03:38.155
You're still planning to
fire me in six months?

03:38.156 --> 03:40.224
I fire because I love.

03:40.225 --> 03:42.259
Move up or move out, Blake.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.694
- Ticktock.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:43.695 --> 03:47.164
I know how important this dinner is,

03:47.165 --> 03:49.366
- so I won't let you down.
- I know you won't.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.301
Sniffy.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.738
Mm-hmm.

03:54.739 --> 03:56.540
So, tonight's invitees
will include staffers

03:56.541 --> 03:58.476
of the Muslim faith,
local community leaders

03:58.477 --> 04:01.212
- and some special guests.
- Yeah, inspiring charity founder,

04:01.213 --> 04:03.147
hero cop, adorable science girl.

04:03.148 --> 04:04.215
And of course,

04:04.216 --> 04:05.783
our guest of honor,
Turkish foreign minister

04:05.784 --> 04:08.018
Hakan Uzun and his family.

04:08.019 --> 04:09.687
Obviously, U.S.-Turkish relations

04:09.688 --> 04:11.889
are at an all-time low.

04:11.890 --> 04:14.725
Whatever our personal feelings
are about Turkey's slide

04:14.726 --> 04:17.661
toward autocracy under
President Kozlu,

04:17.661 --> 04:19.596
they are a NATO ally

04:19.598 --> 04:21.832
and a critical strategic partner.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.836
Ma'am, again, if my actions
with the refugees from Abkhazia

04:24.837 --> 04:25.936
- Kat.
- contributed to our current issues

04:25.937 --> 04:28.072
with Turkey, I am truly sorry.

04:28.073 --> 04:29.173
Nevertheless...

04:29.174 --> 04:31.976
we need to get the
relationship back on track.

04:31.977 --> 04:34.411
JAY: Well, we're hoping that this
dinner will be a good start.

04:34.412 --> 04:36.447
I've been in communication
with the Office of Protocol

04:36.448 --> 04:39.083
to make sure that we get all
the details just right.

04:39.084 --> 04:41.919
I am handing the last-minute liaising

04:41.920 --> 04:44.021
with Protocol over to Blake.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.222
Really?

04:45.223 --> 04:46.357
Yes.

04:46.358 --> 04:49.293
I mean, you know,
I accept... your decision.

04:49.294 --> 04:51.695
Well, I for one am looking
forward to working with them.

04:51.696 --> 04:55.399
Great. Here's some changes
to the seating chart.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.134
- Buckle up.
- Excuse me, ma'am,

04:57.135 --> 04:59.469
you're needed in the
White House right away.

05:02.206 --> 05:05.541
Jay and Kat, walk with me, please.

05:09.413 --> 05:11.482
We're getting reports in from Iraq

05:11.483 --> 05:14.552
that a group of ISIL dead-enders
have seized control

05:14.553 --> 05:16.186
of Fakhiri Dam.

05:16.187 --> 05:18.155
They're threatening to blow it up.

05:18.156 --> 05:21.584
My God, millions of people depend
on that dam for water and power.

05:21.585 --> 05:23.193
Yeah, and most of them
will be in the path

05:23.194 --> 05:24.828
of the flood wave if it collapses.

05:24.829 --> 05:26.797
My God, we're talking
about massive levels

05:26.798 --> 05:28.599
of devastation from Mosul to Baghdad.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.601
Well, if they haven't
blown it up already,

05:30.602 --> 05:32.770
- they must have demands, right?
- I don't know. I'll know more

05:32.771 --> 05:34.672
when I get to the White House.
Thank you.

05:34.673 --> 05:35.839
Military options?

05:35.840 --> 05:37.708
Not great, I'm guessing.
We need ideas.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.743
I'll call you from the car. Excuse me.

05:39.744 --> 05:41.444
- KAT: Understood.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:43.247 --> 05:44.915
RUSSELL (SIGHS): <i>Oh, man.</i>

05:44.916 --> 05:46.587
The situation with the dam in Iraq

05:46.588 --> 05:49.657
is even worse than we thought.

05:49.658 --> 05:52.760
Well, you know what else is
even worse than we thought?

05:52.761 --> 05:54.896
(SIGHS): My blood pressure.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.833
The aptly named Dr. Stern
made that very clear.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.768
Because you're not doing
anything about it.

06:00.769 --> 06:02.270
I take beta-blockers,

06:02.271 --> 06:03.971
I don't eat anything I like...

06:03.972 --> 06:05.773
You heard her.

06:05.774 --> 06:08.776
You need to lower your
stress level dramatically.

06:08.777 --> 06:10.278
I golf. Sometimes.

06:10.279 --> 06:12.013
To arm-twist congressmen.

06:12.014 --> 06:13.681
That's hardly the relaxation practice

06:13.682 --> 06:15.016
she was talking about.

06:15.017 --> 06:16.184
'Course, you know what I think.

06:16.185 --> 06:17.618
- Oh, here we go.
- You want to live?

06:17.619 --> 06:18.986
- Quit.
- (SIGHS): Carol...

06:18.987 --> 06:20.688
Retire to a cabin by a lake

06:20.689 --> 06:23.124
- in Vermont like we always talk about...
- You know I can't do that right now.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.593
...while you still have
some good years left, Russ.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.795
Do you understand what's
happening in Iraq today? Do you?

06:27.796 --> 06:29.797
Don't you crisis-guilt me, okay?
I operate on children.

06:29.798 --> 06:31.999
If we don't handle this right,
hundreds of thousands of people

06:32.000 --> 06:34.434
- could die.
- And you could be one of them.

06:37.004 --> 06:39.741
CAROL: <i>I need to hear
a real plan here.</i>

06:39.742 --> 06:41.576
<i>Yoga, Pilates,</i>

06:41.577 --> 06:42.777
sensory deprivation tank...

06:42.778 --> 06:46.246
- That sounds awful.
- People say it's relaxing!

06:47.782 --> 06:51.119
(CHUCKLES) And here's your
apple-cheeked enabler.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.721
Honey, she saved my life.

06:53.722 --> 06:56.690
Why are you giving him coffee?

06:59.060 --> 07:01.496
RUSSELL: Look, I love you,

07:01.497 --> 07:04.865
I hear you, and I'm into it, okay?

07:06.434 --> 07:08.436
Hey.

07:08.437 --> 07:10.103
Okay?

07:13.541 --> 07:15.809
Tell Stevie I'm sorry.

07:19.881 --> 07:23.785
So, find you some kind of
relaxation activity. On it.

07:23.786 --> 07:26.053
That I'll stick with...
that's very important.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.022
Options by this afternoon
would be appreciated.

07:28.023 --> 07:30.024
- Absolutely.
- Keep this between us, will you?

07:30.025 --> 07:32.660
I don't want anyone getting the
idea there's blood in the water.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.128
- Of course.
- Thank you.

07:34.129 --> 07:35.296
Oh.

07:35.297 --> 07:37.865
I don't want to do anything, uh...

07:37.866 --> 07:41.636
touchy-feely or,
you know, weird, okay?

07:41.637 --> 07:44.238
Define "weird."

07:44.239 --> 07:46.507
Like the Supreme Court
said about pornography...

07:46.508 --> 07:48.808
you'll know it when you see it.

07:51.697 --> 07:54.000
BECKER: They chose to attack
at night under cloud cover

07:54.001 --> 07:56.269
so our drones weren't
operating at 100%.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.337
And lastly,
a small but well-armed force

07:58.338 --> 07:59.672
attacked the dam

07:59.673 --> 08:02.141
right as many Iraqis were
breaking their fast for Ramadan.

08:02.142 --> 08:03.776
Their own little Tet Offensive.

08:03.777 --> 08:06.336
Has CIA authenticated

08:06.337 --> 08:08.371
that ransom video?

08:08.372 --> 08:11.007
The IC's down and dirty
assessment is that it's real.

08:11.008 --> 08:13.143
They want their leader, Abu Kaebi,

08:13.144 --> 08:15.678
released from prison in Iraq,

08:15.679 --> 08:19.349
along with 2,000 of his
fighters, within 24 hours,

08:19.350 --> 08:22.052
or they'll... destroy the dam.

08:22.053 --> 08:24.888
And what does Prime
Minister Arif say to that?

08:24.889 --> 08:26.689
I spoke with him briefly.

08:26.690 --> 08:29.459
He feels that Iraq has
spilled too much blood

08:29.460 --> 08:31.194
fighting ISIL to give in

08:31.195 --> 08:32.227
to these demands.

08:32.229 --> 08:33.596
Can't argue with him there.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.798
Meanwhile, he's ordered

08:34.799 --> 08:38.368
the evacuation of the
potential flood zone, but...

08:38.369 --> 08:40.636
well, given that the area's so large,

08:40.638 --> 08:43.339
- the effort is...
- Pandemonium.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.574
Yeah.

08:44.575 --> 08:45.809
So...

08:45.810 --> 08:48.410
Iraq wants to stage a raid.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.114
What do the generals think, Gordon?

08:51.115 --> 08:53.316
The dam is not heavily defended, sir,

08:53.317 --> 08:55.718
but it's obviously a
huge installation.

08:55.719 --> 08:57.053
And we have very high confidence

08:57.054 --> 08:59.589
that the enemy has placed
large amounts of explosives

08:59.590 --> 09:01.991
down there, by the turbines.

09:01.992 --> 09:03.960
What odds do the planners
give that we can

09:03.961 --> 09:06.229
neutralize the bad guys before they...

09:06.230 --> 09:07.630
blow up the dam?

09:07.631 --> 09:08.798
BECKER: 20%, sir.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.167
Ten if we leave it to the Iraqis.

09:11.168 --> 09:12.969
And if we fail?

09:12.970 --> 09:15.138
We're talking about a
humanitarian catastrophe

09:15.139 --> 09:18.942
on an... almost unimaginable scale.

09:18.943 --> 09:20.710
So what do we do?

09:20.711 --> 09:24.146
♪

09:26.850 --> 09:28.284
You know,

09:28.285 --> 09:30.820
the Tigris is also dammed

09:30.821 --> 09:32.655
upstream near its source

09:32.656 --> 09:34.824
in Ozbek...

09:34.825 --> 09:37.460
Turkey.

09:37.461 --> 09:39.762
If we could prevail on the Turks

09:39.763 --> 09:41.764
to stop the flow,

09:41.765 --> 09:44.934
it would, at the very least,
lower the water level

09:44.935 --> 09:48.403
downstream... in Iraq.

09:49.606 --> 09:51.941
It would certainly lessen the
damage in the event of a flood.

09:51.942 --> 09:54.477
Do you think Kozlu would go for it?

09:54.478 --> 09:57.347
We're not exactly in a great
place with the Turks right now.

09:57.348 --> 09:58.448
It's hard to imagine

09:58.449 --> 10:00.450
he'd let millions of
his fellow Muslims

10:00.451 --> 10:03.019
die out of spite,
especially during Ramadan.

10:03.020 --> 10:06.322
- Is it? Have you met the man?
- (CHUCKLES)

10:06.323 --> 10:09.759
Maybe Foreign Minister Uzun

10:09.760 --> 10:11.828
could be helpful here.

10:11.829 --> 10:14.664
We could invite him in
for a conference call

10:14.665 --> 10:16.432
with President Kozlu.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.368
Worth a shot.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.003
Set it up.

10:20.004 --> 10:21.604
All right.

10:21.605 --> 10:23.106
Meanwhile...

10:23.107 --> 10:25.341
keep banging on military options.

10:25.342 --> 10:29.012
We get the odds up to 70-30...

10:29.013 --> 10:30.647
do it.

10:30.648 --> 10:32.781
BECKER: Understood, sir.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.985
Of course we can stop
the flow of the Tigris

10:35.986 --> 10:37.220
from Turkey into Iraq.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.454
Thank you, Mr. President.

10:38.455 --> 10:40.823
The people of Iraq will
owe you a great debt.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.158
They will owe me nothing.

10:42.159 --> 10:43.927
I would merely be doing my duty

10:43.928 --> 10:45.428
as a good neighbor and Muslim.

10:45.429 --> 10:46.963
ELIZABETH: I'm sorry, Mr. President,

10:46.964 --> 10:50.600
but to be clear... you <i>would</i>
stop the Tigris's flow,

10:50.601 --> 10:51.968
or you <i>will</i> stop it?

10:51.969 --> 10:54.571
The United States has
denigrated my government

10:54.572 --> 10:57.473
and our partnership for some time.

10:57.474 --> 10:59.976
I agree, Your Excellency, and I
intend to take these matters up

10:59.977 --> 11:01.477
with the secretary right away.

11:01.478 --> 11:04.046
However, at this moment, perhaps we...

11:09.118 --> 11:13.089
What is it the United States
could do at this moment

11:13.090 --> 11:16.626
that would alleviate some
of these bad feelings,

11:16.627 --> 11:19.062
Mr. President?
We have an election coming up.

11:19.063 --> 11:21.331
But the Council of Europe and the OSCE

11:21.332 --> 11:24.667
insist on having
monitors watch over us.

11:24.668 --> 11:27.904
This is an unacceptable
affront to our sovereignty.

11:27.905 --> 11:31.541
Mr. President, the United
States has no election monitors

11:31.542 --> 11:33.576
headed for Turkey, nor do we plan to.

11:33.577 --> 11:37.180
And we have no control over
what the Europeans do,

11:37.181 --> 11:40.383
and no more power to sway the OSCE

11:40.384 --> 11:43.353
than any other member state,
Turkey included.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.054
When properly motivated,

11:45.055 --> 11:47.857
the United States always has a say.

11:47.858 --> 11:49.859
And now, I must attend

11:49.860 --> 11:51.227
to other matters.

11:51.228 --> 11:53.930
Good day to you all.

11:53.931 --> 11:55.598
What other matters could he have?

11:55.599 --> 11:56.966
The man's on vacation.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.069
Minister Uzun, you must
understand that this...

12:00.070 --> 12:03.306
this demand is something
we literally can't meet.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.308
And he shouldn't be making
any demands at all.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.377
Is he gonna help, or not?

12:07.378 --> 12:10.013
His Excellency has been
agitated for quite some time,

12:10.014 --> 12:13.616
about foreign entities attacking
the legitimacy of our system.

12:13.617 --> 12:15.485
And rightly so.

12:15.486 --> 12:19.389
If you are not prepared to
engage with him on that subject,

12:19.390 --> 12:23.926
perhaps we can find something
of even greater value?

12:23.927 --> 12:26.696
And quickly.

12:26.697 --> 12:33.603
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

12:37.437 --> 12:39.139
Trying to get the election
monitors kicked out

12:39.140 --> 12:41.475
is obviously BS,
so what does he really want?

12:41.476 --> 12:43.510
Maybe we throw him an economic bone?

12:43.511 --> 12:46.193
A free trade agreement?

12:46.194 --> 12:48.896
No. Kozlu won't find that sexy enough.

12:48.897 --> 12:50.598
Surface-to-air missile batteries,

12:50.599 --> 12:52.199
so they'll cancel their
order with the Russians?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.903
No, the only thing
that he wants from us

12:55.904 --> 12:58.973
is a freer hand to attack
the Kurds in Syria.

12:58.974 --> 13:00.841
We're not gonna let him
bomb our own allies.

13:00.842 --> 13:02.376
He's got to know that.

13:02.377 --> 13:04.678
That's the box he's
trying to put us in.

13:04.679 --> 13:08.516
You know, I got to hand it to Kozlu.

13:08.517 --> 13:10.551
He never misses an opportunity

13:10.552 --> 13:14.522
to show what a singularly
awful person he is.

13:14.523 --> 13:15.990
JAY: And his own people know it.

13:15.991 --> 13:17.191
That's why he's trying to get

13:17.192 --> 13:18.592
these election monitors kicked out.

13:18.593 --> 13:20.528
If this election were
anything close to fair,

13:20.529 --> 13:22.596
he'd lose in a landslide.

13:22.597 --> 13:23.864
- (EXHALES) Yeah.
- All right.

13:23.865 --> 13:25.332
KAT: Ma'am?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.134
Oh, hey, did you connect with
the foreign minister's office?

13:27.135 --> 13:29.003
'Cause we sure could use some advice

13:29.004 --> 13:31.338
on how to move his horrendous boss.

13:31.339 --> 13:32.473
Yeah, they didn't pick up.

13:32.474 --> 13:33.774
What do you mean, they didn't pick up?

13:33.775 --> 13:36.277
Uzun is right over at
the Turkish embassy.

13:36.278 --> 13:37.812
Are you saying they
wouldn't take your call?

13:37.813 --> 13:39.580
I'm saying there was no answer.

13:39.581 --> 13:41.715
So then, I tried calling
the ministry in Ankara.

13:41.716 --> 13:43.918
Also, no answer. I even tried my
own contacts in the government,

13:43.919 --> 13:45.186
and no answer.

13:45.187 --> 13:46.921
So the Turkish government
has gone dark?

13:46.922 --> 13:48.422
What the hell does that mean?

13:48.423 --> 13:50.591
Nothing good.

13:50.592 --> 13:52.860
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:52.861 --> 13:54.495
Well, Blake,
to what do we owe the pleasure?

13:54.496 --> 13:56.297
BLAKE: Oh, Mr. Ambassador.

13:56.298 --> 13:57.998
Please, call me Cyril.

13:57.999 --> 14:00.801
- Oh...
- And you know Quentin and Sameera?

14:00.802 --> 14:02.002
Of course.

14:02.003 --> 14:03.437
Uh, Jay is busy with the secretary.

14:03.438 --> 14:04.939
I'll be doing my best
to fill his shoes.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.774
He sends his apologies.

14:06.775 --> 14:09.110
Well, I'll be expecting a nice
bottle of Scotch from him.

14:09.111 --> 14:10.778
But not too nice,
because it's the note

14:10.779 --> 14:12.012
- that matters.
- The note that matters.

14:12.013 --> 14:13.247
Indeed.

14:13.248 --> 14:15.216
- (CHUCKLES)
- Well.

14:15.217 --> 14:18.586
Uh, to the matter at hand.

14:18.587 --> 14:22.256
Obviously, we're cognizant
of the situation in Iraq,

14:22.257 --> 14:23.924
so we're prepared to scale back

14:23.925 --> 14:26.894
the evening's more festive
elements, should the need arise.

14:26.895 --> 14:28.195
SAMEERA: Wouldn't want the secretary

14:28.196 --> 14:31.132
whooping it up in the face
of a humanitarian crisis.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.167
We prepare for every contingency.

14:33.168 --> 14:34.702
You really do.

14:34.703 --> 14:36.737
CYRIL: Obviously, tonight's guest
of honor is Minister Uzun,

14:36.738 --> 14:39.740
so we're skewing the
meal a bit Turkish.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.108
QUENTIN: To break the fast,

14:41.109 --> 14:43.577
we are serving dates he
brought with him as a gift.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.112
At the same time, we're, of course,

14:45.113 --> 14:47.615
embracing the diversity of
America's Muslim community.

14:47.616 --> 14:49.817
CYRIL: The point being,
we're mending fences,

14:49.818 --> 14:52.086
but we're also very subtly,
and with great respect,

14:52.087 --> 14:53.521
saying to Turkey,

14:53.522 --> 14:57.725
"Here in America, we build bridges."

14:57.726 --> 14:59.860
Well, that is precisely the message

14:59.861 --> 15:01.996
the secretary wants to send.

15:01.997 --> 15:04.265
Uh, she did just have
a few small changes

15:04.266 --> 15:05.866
to the seating chart.

15:05.867 --> 15:08.736
CYRIL: Well, we've only been
working on the existing one

15:08.737 --> 15:10.371
for the past several weeks.

15:10.372 --> 15:13.908
But absolutely, let's throw
it out at the last minute.

15:13.909 --> 15:17.711
I thought you said you
anticipated every contingency.

15:17.712 --> 15:20.114
You can't plan...

15:20.115 --> 15:22.750
for a seating chart change
at a 200-person dinner.

15:22.751 --> 15:25.452
It's an intricately constructed web

15:25.453 --> 15:28.689
of rank, title, and compatibility.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.858
There are too many permutations.

15:30.859 --> 15:33.192
BOTH: It's mathematically unfeasible.

15:36.497 --> 15:39.099
Tell the secretary that,
of course, we'll find a way.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.834
Now, if you'll excuse us,

15:40.835 --> 15:44.470
we are... quite busy.

15:45.206 --> 15:46.774
Of course.

15:46.775 --> 15:49.176
(GASPS)

15:49.177 --> 15:51.312
Just... Sorry. Sorry.

15:51.313 --> 15:52.580
STEVIE: <i>Seriously, Dad, though,</i>

15:52.581 --> 15:55.616
what am I gonna do?
Uh, I've got yoga options,

15:55.617 --> 15:57.985
meditation, Gregorian chanting.

15:57.986 --> 15:59.920
- (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHING): It's serious.

15:59.921 --> 16:02.389
Can you imagine Russell chanting?

16:02.390 --> 16:04.825
Oh, it's funny 'cause I'm screwed.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.293
Well, look,

16:06.294 --> 16:08.729
all those practices are just
warm-ups for the real work,

16:08.730 --> 16:10.531
which is the spiritual journey, right?

16:10.532 --> 16:13.067
But Russell strikes
me as the kind of guy

16:13.068 --> 16:15.569
who's spent his entire life
running away from big questions,

16:15.570 --> 16:17.905
so either he'll
eventually confront them,

16:17.906 --> 16:19.640
or he'll drive himself

16:19.641 --> 16:21.342
to an early grave
trying to avoid them.

16:21.343 --> 16:24.711
(SIGHS) No, but thank you for,
like, hashing it out with me.

16:26.847 --> 16:28.716
Okay, I feel bad eating
in front of you.

16:28.717 --> 16:31.385
Are you hungry? Do you want some?

16:31.386 --> 16:32.920
No. I'm fine.

16:32.921 --> 16:34.054
Okay.

16:34.055 --> 16:36.156
But how is that sandwich?

16:36.157 --> 16:38.459
WARE: <i>Elements of the Turkish military</i>

16:38.460 --> 16:41.262
appear to have risen up
against the Kozlu regime.

16:41.263 --> 16:42.730
There are running gun battles

16:42.731 --> 16:44.932
on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul.

16:44.933 --> 16:47.468
Is this connected
with Iraq in some way

16:47.469 --> 16:50.404
or do we just have the
worst luck in the world?

16:50.405 --> 16:51.772
They appear to be unrelated.

16:51.773 --> 16:53.040
The coup plotters are broadcasting

16:53.041 --> 16:55.142
on the main television station
that they're fighting

16:55.143 --> 16:56.510
for the return of democracy

16:56.511 --> 16:58.579
and civil society in Turkey.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.347
Where's Kozlu?

17:00.348 --> 17:01.548
WARE: Off the grid, sir.

17:01.549 --> 17:02.783
The coup appears to have been timed

17:02.784 --> 17:04.018
to coincide with his vacation.

17:04.019 --> 17:06.119
Keep me posted.

17:06.121 --> 17:09.290
Sir, if there's no one
in charge in Turkey,

17:09.290 --> 17:12.092
we don't have anyone to negotiate with

17:12.093 --> 17:14.461
about stopping the
Tigris's flow into Iraq.

17:14.462 --> 17:17.829
Then it's all bad options
from here on out.

17:24.405 --> 17:26.628
Prime Minister Arif,
I'm sure you're aware

17:26.630 --> 17:28.131
of the situation in Turkey.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.166
We'd hoped they could help
by stopping the Tigris

17:30.167 --> 17:32.568
on their side of the border,
but now it's...

17:32.569 --> 17:34.137
unclear who's in charge there.

17:34.138 --> 17:35.768
ARIF: I never could have imagined

17:35.769 --> 17:38.253
the day when I would be
hoping for the Turks

17:38.254 --> 17:39.854
to turn off our water supply.

17:39.855 --> 17:42.690
How are the Iraqi people doing?

17:42.691 --> 17:45.260
ARIF: The evacuation is chaotic.

17:45.261 --> 17:48.430
And my cabinet remains
divided on how to proceed.

17:48.431 --> 17:50.765
Is there anything that the
United States can do to help?

17:50.766 --> 17:52.934
Well, we must retake the dam.

17:52.935 --> 17:55.136
BECKER: But Mr. Prime Minister,
the Pentagon has communicated

17:55.137 --> 17:56.571
to your commanders

17:56.572 --> 17:59.641
that such a strike has a
90% chance of failure.

17:59.642 --> 18:01.476
Omar, the United States' position

18:01.477 --> 18:03.111
is that you free the terrorists

18:03.112 --> 18:04.712
and Iraq lives to fight another day.

18:04.713 --> 18:06.748
ARIF: No! I will not release

18:06.749 --> 18:08.883
a genocidal maniac and 2,000

18:08.884 --> 18:11.052
of his most hardened
followers into my country.

18:11.053 --> 18:13.354
We are keeping Daesh talking

18:13.355 --> 18:16.057
while we position our
Special Forces units

18:16.058 --> 18:18.660
for a strike tonight.

18:18.661 --> 18:21.296
I agree that you're being
presented an awful choice

18:21.297 --> 18:22.997
between two catastrophes.

18:22.998 --> 18:26.468
But releasing Abu Kaebi and
his men is the lesser.

18:26.469 --> 18:28.536
They are equally bad.

18:28.537 --> 18:31.206
One will just unfold more slowly.

18:31.207 --> 18:33.141
Whatever the odds,

18:33.142 --> 18:36.244
with you or alone,
we are prepared to fight.

18:36.245 --> 18:39.414
And inshallah, we will prevail.

18:39.415 --> 18:41.014
Mr. Prime Minister...

18:43.518 --> 18:45.653
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

18:45.654 --> 18:47.854
Mr. President.

18:49.491 --> 18:52.093
Mr. President, the Joint
Chiefs will push back hard

18:52.094 --> 18:54.329
on sending our troops
on a suicide mission.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.965
I understand, Gordon,
but if we leave the Iraqis

18:56.966 --> 18:58.766
to do it, the mission
has no chance at all.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.168
RUSSELL: So maybe we lean on Arif.

19:00.169 --> 19:02.770
Threaten to cut off aid
unless he capitulates.

19:02.771 --> 19:04.973
He'll lose all legitimacy.

19:04.974 --> 19:07.242
The Shias and the Kurds
will be convinced

19:07.243 --> 19:09.344
this is all some kind of Sunni plot.

19:09.345 --> 19:11.146
And being a Sunni himself,
he'll be seen as complicit.

19:11.147 --> 19:13.581
Sectarian tensions will boil over,

19:13.582 --> 19:15.750
and the central government

19:15.751 --> 19:18.153
will lack the authority
to get it under control.

19:18.154 --> 19:20.221
We'll have no partner in Baghdad.

19:20.222 --> 19:22.524
Better that than the whole
place going underwater.

19:22.525 --> 19:26.694
Gordon, have JSOC coordinate on
planning with the Iraqi Army.

19:26.695 --> 19:30.031
We'll come back at Arif in
a few hours if need be.

19:30.032 --> 19:31.733
Meanwhile, it would be great

19:31.734 --> 19:34.469
if we could find out what the
hell is going on in Turkey.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.703
That'll be all.

19:41.976 --> 19:44.212
You have the eager look of someone

19:44.213 --> 19:47.214
about to sell me something
I am not gonna like.

19:48.149 --> 19:49.584
Is now a bad time?

19:49.585 --> 19:51.052
Well, there's a coup in a country

19:51.053 --> 19:53.955
that houses 50 American
nuclear warheads,

19:53.956 --> 19:57.792
Iraq is looking at a flood
of biblical proportions,

19:57.793 --> 20:01.563
so, sure, let's talk yoga.

20:01.564 --> 20:04.699
Okay. How do you feel about yoga?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.034
I don't like it.

20:06.035 --> 20:07.068
What else?

20:07.069 --> 20:10.939
Tai Chi, very meditative.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.473
Eh, seems fringy.

20:12.474 --> 20:14.609
Literally, hundreds of millions

20:14.610 --> 20:16.010
of Chinese people do it every day.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.512
Do I look Chinese?

20:17.513 --> 20:19.047
- What else?
- Well,

20:19.048 --> 20:20.782
mindful breathing, there's
nothing simpler than that.

20:20.783 --> 20:23.184
Makes me feel like I'm
forgetting how to breathe.

20:23.185 --> 20:24.552
Pass.

20:24.553 --> 20:27.322
Well, maybe that's the issue:

20:27.323 --> 20:30.891
that you can't just sit
still and be with yourself.

20:32.393 --> 20:33.595
What?

20:33.596 --> 20:35.096
I... well, I was talking to my dad

20:35.097 --> 20:36.831
- about this, he said...
- Your dad.

20:36.832 --> 20:39.334
Yeah. He suggested maybe

20:39.335 --> 20:42.370
what you should be doing is, um,
is asking the big questions.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.839
Okay. Well, here's one:

20:44.840 --> 20:47.675
why did you tell your
father about a conversation

20:47.676 --> 20:51.346
I specifically asked you
to keep between us?

20:51.347 --> 20:53.014
I'm sorry. I...

20:53.015 --> 20:55.650
I just... he... he
usually gives really...

20:55.651 --> 20:59.387
Look, it's fine.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.855
I'll take it from here.

21:00.856 --> 21:03.358
Just, um...

21:03.359 --> 21:05.625
close the door on your
way out, will you?

21:08.096 --> 21:10.263
Thank you.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.668
(DOOR CLOSES)

21:13.669 --> 21:16.671
A raid on the dam at this point

21:16.672 --> 21:20.008
is an almost guaranteed disaster.

21:20.009 --> 21:22.310
I continue to think our best hope

21:22.311 --> 21:23.845
is stopping the water in Turkey.

21:23.846 --> 21:25.146
The latest Intel

21:25.147 --> 21:26.581
is that the anti-Kozlu forces

21:26.582 --> 21:28.549
appear to be gaining
ground across the country.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.385
They're attempting to seize military

21:30.386 --> 21:31.386
and civilian infrastructure.

21:31.387 --> 21:32.787
Are they in control of the Ozbek Dam?

21:32.788 --> 21:34.055
Well, they're active in the east,

21:34.056 --> 21:35.423
so there's a decent chance they are.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.191
But the situation's still
chaotic, and we don't know

21:37.192 --> 21:39.260
- who to talk to.
- And President Kozlu?

21:39.261 --> 21:40.995
Still M.I.A. Minister Uzun's

21:40.996 --> 21:43.798
been holed up at the
Turkish embassy all day.

21:43.799 --> 21:46.234
I'm assuming he's not coming
to the iftar tonight,

21:46.235 --> 21:49.170
which cannot come fast enough...
so to speak.

21:49.171 --> 21:50.705
BLAKE: Actually, his
office said he'll be here,

21:50.706 --> 21:52.607
but only for a short while.

21:52.608 --> 21:54.175
Trying to project
stability to the world.

21:54.176 --> 21:55.843
Good. He seemed

21:55.844 --> 21:59.013
sympathetic to the Iraqis'
plight this morning.

21:59.014 --> 22:00.848
He'd know who to call.

22:00.849 --> 22:02.717
Maybe we can work on him at the iftar.

22:02.718 --> 22:04.886
BLAKE: His office specifically
said he won't discuss

22:04.887 --> 22:06.688
any policy or take
any private meetings

22:06.689 --> 22:09.390
with U.S. officials
without input from...

22:09.391 --> 22:11.993
- his president.
- KAT: Sounds like the security services

22:11.994 --> 22:14.529
loyal to Kozlu aren't taking any
chances about who's on his side.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.030
All right,
we're gonna have to find a way

22:16.031 --> 22:17.665
to get him alone tonight.

22:17.666 --> 22:21.269
Cyril, this place looks amazing.

22:21.270 --> 22:22.570
You've worked another miracle.

22:22.571 --> 22:24.372
That was nothing.

22:24.373 --> 22:27.175
But the seating chart?
Now, <i>that's</i> a miracle.

22:27.176 --> 22:29.310
(CHUCKLES) Well, the
secretary appreciates that.

22:29.311 --> 22:32.747
And she has another request.

22:32.748 --> 22:36.017
Blake, our guests are due to
arrive in less than an hour.

22:36.018 --> 22:37.919
(WHISPERING): I know. Could
I just see you one second?

22:37.920 --> 22:39.687
Over here. Excuse us.

22:39.688 --> 22:42.055
Thanks. (CLEARS THROAT)

22:44.292 --> 22:47.061
What does the secretary need now?

22:47.062 --> 22:50.665
A private pull aside with
Minister Uzun for a few minutes.

22:50.666 --> 22:53.267
You know Turkey's ground rules.

22:53.268 --> 22:54.502
Uzun's stopping by

22:54.503 --> 22:56.771
for a quick grip and grin
with the secretar...

22:56.772 --> 22:59.040
We've already moved the main table

22:59.041 --> 23:01.409
so he'll be able to
leave more discreetly.

23:01.410 --> 23:04.045
Then he's going directly
back to the Turkish embassy.

23:04.046 --> 23:07.181
To even attempt a one-on-one

23:07.182 --> 23:09.550
risks a major diplomatic crisis.

23:09.551 --> 23:12.420
Well, better that than a
major humanitarian crisis,

23:12.421 --> 23:15.390
which is what we're facing
if she doesn't at least try.

23:15.391 --> 23:18.259
Where would she even
have this conversation?

23:18.260 --> 23:19.527
We are still working that out.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.095
(SIGHS)

23:21.096 --> 23:22.757
Far be it from me to
second-guess her, but...

23:22.758 --> 23:24.028
Then don't.

23:24.465 --> 23:26.701
Cyril, she's going to do this.

23:26.702 --> 23:29.402
And we're going to help her, okay?

23:30.204 --> 23:31.572
Good.

23:31.573 --> 23:34.075
Now, Uzun's detail will
remain down in the lobby,

23:34.076 --> 23:37.412
but there's going to be a man
from the embassy with him,

23:37.413 --> 23:38.546
Ahmet Avci.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.548
Part-time attaché, full-time spy.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.511
I know him.

23:41.512 --> 23:44.352
Well, he's going to be
watching Uzun like a hawk.

23:44.353 --> 23:46.753
Somehow we have to separate them.

23:48.489 --> 23:52.860
IMAM (CHANTING):
<i>Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:52.861 --> 23:55.062
MEN: <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:55.063 --> 23:57.365
IMAM: <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:57.366 --> 23:59.667
MEN: <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

23:59.668 --> 24:02.869
KAT: There's Minister Uzun and Avci.

24:04.005 --> 24:05.940
Hey. Daisy Grant, Matt Mahoney.

24:05.941 --> 24:07.508
CYRIL: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

24:07.509 --> 24:08.643
and welcome.

24:08.644 --> 24:09.811
We're so pleased

24:09.812 --> 24:11.345
that you were all able
to attend this evening.

24:11.346 --> 24:12.380
If you could please

24:12.381 --> 24:14.215
begin to find your way to your seats,

24:14.216 --> 24:15.383
we'd be most appreciative.

24:15.384 --> 24:18.152
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of State

24:18.153 --> 24:21.721
of the United States of America,
Elizabeth McCord.

24:23.424 --> 24:26.227
ELIZABETH: Thank you.

24:26.228 --> 24:29.530
Ramadan Kareem, everyone.

24:29.531 --> 24:31.899
I know better than to
stand between a group

24:31.900 --> 24:34.469
of hungry fasters and
a delicious buffet,

24:34.470 --> 24:36.871
so I will keep this really brief.

24:36.872 --> 24:38.206
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)

24:38.207 --> 24:40.842
Ramadan is a holy month

24:40.843 --> 24:43.644
and a special time for
Muslims across the globe.

24:43.645 --> 24:46.047
It's a time for friends

24:46.048 --> 24:49.050
and families,
for prayer and reflection,

24:49.051 --> 24:51.486
for stepping out of usual routines

24:51.487 --> 24:54.055
to contemplate what's
truly important in life.

24:54.056 --> 24:57.825
Fasting not only facilitates this,

24:57.826 --> 25:00.862
but it also offers a chance
to reflect on the deprivation

25:00.863 --> 25:03.664
of others and to take
compassionate action

25:03.665 --> 25:05.800
to alleviate it, and that's what many

25:05.801 --> 25:08.703
of tonight's honorees have done.

25:08.704 --> 25:11.072
Like Adeela Zadari,

25:11.073 --> 25:13.674
who took our nation's
top science prize

25:13.675 --> 25:16.711
for high school students
home to Plano, Texas.

25:16.712 --> 25:19.580
Adeela says that she loves science

25:19.581 --> 25:22.850
because it offers so many
opportunities to help others.

25:22.851 --> 25:25.920
She and many others
here truly represent

25:25.921 --> 25:28.055
the best of America.

25:28.056 --> 25:29.123
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:29.124 --> 25:30.491
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge

25:30.492 --> 25:33.127
Foreign Minister Hakan Uzun of Turkey.

25:33.128 --> 25:35.129
Our two nations have been

25:35.130 --> 25:37.798
steadfast partners in
a challenging world

25:37.799 --> 25:40.067
for more than 50 years.

25:40.068 --> 25:42.703
May that partnership
continue to make the world

25:42.704 --> 25:45.439
safer and freer for years to come.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.744
Well, everyone, I know
that I have talked enough.

25:49.745 --> 25:51.546
I wish all of you and your families

25:51.547 --> 25:54.181
a happy and peaceful Ramadan.

25:54.182 --> 25:56.483
Now let's eat.

25:59.353 --> 26:01.322
Thank you for those wonderful
words, Madam Secretary.

26:01.323 --> 26:02.557
And for this lovely occasion.

26:02.558 --> 26:04.525
I truly regret that we cannot stay.

26:04.526 --> 26:06.027
Well, I completely understand.

26:06.028 --> 26:08.029
- PHOTOGRAPHER: Madam Secretary.
- Of course. Oh.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.197
Excuse me, ma'am.

26:10.198 --> 26:11.799
There's an important call for
you from the White House.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.501
Oh. As always, a pleasure, Hakan.

26:13.502 --> 26:15.835
- You as well, Elizabeth.
- I'm so sorry.

26:20.074 --> 26:22.810
Ahmet! Delightful to see you.

26:22.811 --> 26:25.179
You, as well, Ambassador,
but I really...

26:25.180 --> 26:27.982
If I could take just a
moment of your time.

26:27.983 --> 26:30.217
This is Miray.

26:30.218 --> 26:32.019
Like you, she hails from Antalya

26:32.020 --> 26:34.522
and would love to say hello.

26:34.523 --> 26:35.990
As-salaam alaikum. Salaam...

26:35.991 --> 26:38.426
Good evening, Minister.

26:38.427 --> 26:41.061
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

26:58.479 --> 27:01.182
We need to talk, Hakan.

27:01.183 --> 27:03.316
And we don't have much time.

27:08.476 --> 27:11.902
The Ozbek Dam has fallen into
the coup plotters' hands,

27:11.903 --> 27:13.437
and we need someone
to tell them to stop

27:13.438 --> 27:16.674
the Tigris' flow into Iraq.

27:16.675 --> 27:18.609
- You are the person to do that.
- They're traitors.

27:18.610 --> 27:20.211
And besides, I couldn't
legitimately order them

27:20.212 --> 27:23.423
- to do whatever I want. - Hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis could be killed.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.363
It is bad enough talking about

27:24.364 --> 27:25.480
- this with you, Elizabeth.
- Millions more

27:25.481 --> 27:27.885
will be displaced,
and they will come to Turkey.

27:27.886 --> 27:29.787
But to conspire with the enemy?

27:29.788 --> 27:31.489
I-I can't.

27:31.490 --> 27:32.857
When you were in the army,

27:32.858 --> 27:36.160
you, you received a
citation for valor, right?

27:36.161 --> 27:38.662
For, for saving a fellow
recruit from drowning.

27:38.663 --> 27:42.600
You are a decent, brave man.

27:42.601 --> 27:45.469
You can do this.

27:45.470 --> 27:49.306
You're asking me to defy my president.

27:49.307 --> 27:51.342
To stop a humanitarian catastrophe

27:51.343 --> 27:53.310
that could engulf the
entire region, yes.

27:53.311 --> 27:55.112
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

27:55.113 --> 27:57.947
We are running out of time. Please.

28:02.153 --> 28:04.288
Enjoying your dinner?

28:04.289 --> 28:06.290
Mmm. It's amazing,

28:06.291 --> 28:09.794
the appreciation you can
have for something so basic.

28:09.795 --> 28:11.996
What's that supposed to mean?

28:11.997 --> 28:13.297
What?

28:13.298 --> 28:14.465
Hmm?

28:14.466 --> 28:16.066
I know you know.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.536
No, I don't. I don't know.

28:18.537 --> 28:20.504
My numbers. My bad numbers.

28:20.505 --> 28:23.107
Relaxation.

28:23.108 --> 28:25.009
- "The big questions."
- Oh, look,

28:25.010 --> 28:26.443
Stevie and I were just spitballing.

28:26.444 --> 28:28.145
- I'm sorry that got back to you.
- (SIGHS)

28:28.146 --> 28:29.580
No, who knows?

28:29.581 --> 28:31.982
Maybe you're right.

28:31.983 --> 28:35.586
Clearly, I need some kind
of spiritual... something

28:35.587 --> 28:39.322
if I want to save, if not
my life, my marriage.

28:41.058 --> 28:43.060
So...

28:43.061 --> 28:46.397
you want to have coffee sometime?

28:46.398 --> 28:49.433
Talk about it?

28:49.434 --> 28:51.669
Sure, Russell.

28:51.670 --> 28:54.938
Great. Don't tell Carol I said coffee.

28:59.376 --> 29:00.911
Thank God.

29:00.912 --> 29:02.379
CYRIL: Fingers crossed.

29:02.380 --> 29:04.815
Yeah, indeed.

29:04.816 --> 29:07.351
Thanks again for your help.

29:07.352 --> 29:10.688
- Oh, and about earlier...
- Oh.

29:10.689 --> 29:14.191
You know, when I was a kid,
my dad worked as a dishwasher

29:14.192 --> 29:17.695
at a banquet hall in New Jersey.

29:17.696 --> 29:21.365
He came here from Ghana
with literally $20

29:21.366 --> 29:23.500
in his pocket.

29:23.501 --> 29:25.703
When my parents visit
me here at State,

29:36.982 --> 29:38.549
your message just doesn't get through.

29:38.550 --> 29:41.518
Wars have broken out over
simple misunderstandings

29:41.519 --> 29:43.420
or lack of respect.

29:43.421 --> 29:47.658

29:57.034 --> 29:59.737
All right. I'll see you at home.

29:59.738 --> 30:01.272
- All right.

- Hey.

30:02.674 --> 30:03.908
- What's up?
- The water level

30:03.909 --> 30:05.709
behind the Fakhiri Dam in
Iraq is starting to fall.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.244
Uzun came through.

30:07.245 --> 30:09.580
- Thank God.
- Which brings us to the second thing.

30:09.581 --> 30:12.349
President Kozlu of Turkey
appears to have resurfaced,

30:12.350 --> 30:15.019
encouraging the Turkish
people and military to resist

30:15.020 --> 30:17.254
the coup plotters and
threatening grave retribution

30:17.255 --> 30:18.622
to anyone who abets them.

30:18.623 --> 30:21.891
Just goes to show,
you can't keep a bad man down.

30:24.261 --> 30:27.131
Mr. President, forces loyal to Kozlu

30:27.132 --> 30:28.465
appear to be gaining ground

30:28.466 --> 30:30.000
across Turkey.

30:30.001 --> 30:32.569
Apparently, the coup plotters

30:32.570 --> 30:34.305
attacked his vacation
home and missed him

30:34.306 --> 30:35.673
by six minutes.

30:35.674 --> 30:39.710
Am I the only one wishing
they'd been six minutes faster?

30:39.711 --> 30:41.545
Well, at least we got the water
turned off on the Turkish side

the situation in Iraq?

30:45.817 --> 30:48.986
We have a surprising development, sir.

30:48.987 --> 30:50.287
The dropping water level

30:50.288 --> 30:52.323
behind the Fakhiri Dam has exposed

30:52.324 --> 30:54.858
a long-sealed maintenance entrance

30:54.859 --> 30:56.093
above the intake tunnels

30:56.094 --> 30:58.829
dating back to the dam's construction.

30:58.830 --> 31:00.998
The hostiles holding the dam
don't appear to be aware of it.

31:00.999 --> 31:03.133
JSOC has worked up new plans

31:03.134 --> 31:06.804
for a SEAL team to
approach the dam by water

31:06.805 --> 31:09.372

ELIZABETH: Mr. President,

31:11.810 --> 31:14.545

in Turkey, he's gonna want

31:14.546 --> 31:15.612
to settle scores.

31:15.613 --> 31:17.414
He could start allowing the Tigris

31:17.415 --> 31:19.283

41:24.436 --> 41:26.604
Well, I just don't
think I could keep up.

41:26.605 --> 41:28.038
(BOTH LAUGH)

41:28.039 --> 41:29.807
You've out-Blaked Blake, Cyril.

41:29.808 --> 41:33.510
Well, for what it's worth, I disagree.

41:33.511 --> 41:35.613
We'd have been honored to have you.

41:35.614 --> 41:37.748
Thank you.

41:37.749 --> 41:39.950
But I'm happy where I am.

41:39.951 --> 41:41.952
(SIGHS)

41:41.953 --> 41:43.787
(WHISPERING): Too bad you can't stay.

41:43.788 --> 41:46.055
Ticktock.

41:47.358 --> 41:49.400
(BLAKE AND ELIZABETH
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

41:49.401 --> 41:51.306
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

41:51.307 --> 41:52.407
Ma'am, there was an attack

41:52.408 --> 41:53.842
on our Kurdish partners
in Syria this morning.

41:53.843 --> 41:55.443
It came from the Turkish
side of the border.

41:55.444 --> 41:58.346
Well, honestly, I thought the
payback would be even worse.

41:58.347 --> 42:00.115
The attackers were
Russian mercenaries.

42:00.116 --> 42:02.050
Wait a minute. Are you telling me

42:02.051 --> 42:06.388
that Kozlu allowed Turkey to
be used as a staging ground

42:06.389 --> 42:09.591
for a military operation by the
Russians against a U.S. ally?

42:09.592 --> 42:11.159
Wow.

42:11.160 --> 42:14.061
He's going to come to
regret that pretty quickly.

42:14.829 --> 42:16.464
Ma'am, the Russians already do.

42:16.465 --> 42:18.500
We had trainers embedded
with the Kurds.

42:18.501 --> 42:20.735
When they came under attack,
they called in air strikes.

42:20.736 --> 42:24.672
How many Russians were killed?

42:24.673 --> 42:25.940
They're still counting the bodies,

42:25.941 --> 42:28.843
but it's in the hundreds.

42:28.844 --> 42:30.078
This isn't gonna end well.

42:30.079 --> 42:32.379
No, it isn't.

42:34.315 --> 42:36.418
This fight with Turkey could end up

42:36.419 --> 42:38.952
tanking our relationship
with Russia, too.
