00:00.096 --> 00:01.430
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:01.520 --> 00:03.719
Mike Ross is a fraud,
and I'm gonna make sure

00:03.730 --> 00:05.499
he never sees the inside
of a courtroom again

00:05.500 --> 00:07.329
unless he's wearing
an orange jumpsuit.

00:07.330 --> 00:08.429
That woman doesn't get
anything

00:08.430 --> 00:10.290
by prosecuting
a fraud like you,

00:10.300 --> 00:11.899
but she would love to get
Harvey Specter.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.130
I'm not turning
on Harvey.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.269
You gotta listen to me!

00:14.270 --> 00:15.809
I'm throwing you
a goddamn lifeline!

00:15.810 --> 00:17.839
I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.279
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.679
I just don't want to lie
to him anymore.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.779
Your whole story about how
Louis got his name on the door

00:23.780 --> 00:24.849
is bullshit!

00:24.850 --> 00:26.479
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.140
It's over.
We're done.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.310
Never even thought
for a second

00:29.320 --> 00:30.619
that you would even
consider

00:30.620 --> 00:33.219
an idea so disgusting
as turning on Harvey.

00:33.220 --> 00:34.780
The only reason
I thought about it

00:34.790 --> 00:38.289
is because I am scared to death
of you going to prison.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.620
I explicitly told you
to stay away from Mike's case.

00:40.630 --> 00:41.759
I don't care.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.560
Donna, I don't think
you get it.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.399
There is going to come a time
where you're gonna

00:45.400 --> 00:47.830
have to choose
between yourself and them.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.339
If they're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come for me.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.079
Are you saying you
coming back to me?

00:52.080 --> 00:53.710
Yes, I am.

00:53.711 --> 00:55.949
Then I'll see you
back in the office tomorrow.

01:00.180 --> 01:08.250
♪ ♪

01:10.030 --> 01:11.559
Dad, you know
I have to practice.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.890
I know you do,
sweetheart,

01:13.900 --> 01:16.629
but there's something
I have to tell you.

01:16.630 --> 01:17.830
What is it?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.500
We're moving
to Connecticut.

01:22.510 --> 01:25.369
What?
Why?

01:25.370 --> 01:27.039
Your mom and I think
it's best for you.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.739
And what if it's not
best for me?

01:28.740 --> 01:30.370
Honey, it is.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.349
And I found us a great apartment
just outside Hartford.

01:33.350 --> 01:36.289
Lot more kids.
You're gonna love it.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.389
An apartment.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.789
That's right.

01:38.790 --> 01:42.729
It's gonna be so much better
than this big, creaky--

01:42.730 --> 01:44.200
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:44.201 --> 01:46.090
No, there isn't.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.899
Yes, there is.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.599
How do you know that?

01:53.600 --> 01:55.800
I don't know,

01:55.810 --> 01:57.969
but I do.

01:57.970 --> 02:00.030
Oh, okay, Donna.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.919
My...business hasn't
worked out,

02:05.920 --> 02:11.819
and your uncle
offered me a job.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.650
I'm so sorry, honey.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.670
It's okay, Daddy.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.170
I'll let you practice.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.939
Dad?

02:32.940 --> 02:36.370
Will there be a room
for my piano?

02:36.380 --> 02:38.615
Honey, I'm afraid
there won't be.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.140
But your aunt teaches
musical theater

02:40.150 --> 02:41.319
just a few towns away.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.989
I've already signed you up.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.060

03:05.040 --> 03:06.730

long enough to finish it.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.170
Oh, you're gonna be here

03:09.180 --> 03:11.179
Which you're gonna tell me
sooner than you think,

03:11.180 --> 03:12.849
because I've don't have
anything to say.

03:12.850 --> 03:14.549
I get it.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.689
Harvey Specter was your boss
for a long time--

03:17.690 --> 03:20.189
maybe even more
than your boss--

03:20.190 --> 03:22.329
in which case,
there's no chance in hell

03:22.330 --> 03:25.400
you didn't know that he was
conspiring with Mike Ross

03:25.401 --> 03:27.659
to break the law.

03:27.660 --> 03:31.229
The only thing I know is...

03:31.230 --> 03:32.660
that unless you're gonna
arrest me,

03:32.670 --> 03:34.569
I'm walking out that door
right now.

03:34.570 --> 03:36.039
Good.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.839
You're as tough
as I expected you to be,

03:37.840 --> 03:40.679
so for now,
you are free to go.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.709
I told you
I wouldn't be here long.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.009
You're gonna get the door
for me?

03:44.010 --> 03:46.240
Oh, I'm not opening the door
to be polite.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.290
I'm opening the door so I can
see the look on your face

03:48.291 --> 03:51.150
when you see who's in that room
across the hall.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.159
Dad?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.459
What the hell did you do?

03:55.460 --> 03:57.229
I didn't do anything.

03:57.230 --> 03:59.629
Turns out your father
got himself involved

03:59.630 --> 04:01.929
in a shady real estate deal
several years ago.

04:01.930 --> 04:05.190
My father has never done
anything wrong in his life.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.130
Just like Mike Ross
and Harvey Specter

04:07.140 --> 04:09.309
have never done
anything wrong?

04:09.310 --> 04:12.579
Ms. Paulsen, maybe
you should reassess

04:12.580 --> 04:14.709
the quality of the men
in your life.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.048
Let me in that room.

04:16.050 --> 04:19.079
Sorry, not possible.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.179
But next time
you see your father,

04:22.180 --> 04:25.449
maybe you explain to him
you put his life on the line

04:25.450 --> 04:28.280
for the man you work for.

04:28.290 --> 04:33.450
You know, I never thought that
I'd say this to another woman,

04:33.460 --> 04:37.260
but you are
a cold, heartless bitch.

04:37.270 --> 04:42.909
I am,
and I've got a card.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.939
Why don't I just leave that
in your purse?

04:45.940 --> 04:47.070
In case you change your mind

04:47.080 --> 04:48.972
about helping me out
with Harvey Specter.

What are you working on?

05:25.250 --> 05:28.449
I'm just trying to figure out
what Gibbs is gonna do next,

05:28.450 --> 05:30.580
figure out
how to fight it.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.219
Is there anything
I can do to help?

05:32.220 --> 05:33.719
Yeah, you can tell me
what your father said

05:33.720 --> 05:36.189
you should do about me.

05:36.190 --> 05:38.190
How would that help?

05:38.200 --> 05:39.699
Because I can't
really focus on this

05:39.700 --> 05:42.299
while I'm worrying
about that.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.669
He told me to look
in the mirror.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.739
And?

05:47.740 --> 05:48.939
How do you expect him
to react, Mike?

05:48.940 --> 05:50.339
He's angry and he's hurt,
and--

05:50.340 --> 05:52.639
Rachel.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.500
He told me
to get rid of you.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.909
Good.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.210
Why good?

05:59.220 --> 06:00.819
Because you told me
that you would stay with me

06:00.820 --> 06:05.819
no matter what, and when you
keep things like that from me,

06:05.820 --> 06:08.680
it makes me wonder.

06:08.690 --> 06:13.490
But when you tell me and
I see that look in your eyes,

06:13.500 --> 06:14.570
I don't.

06:15.730 --> 06:18.060
Mr. Litt,
I'm all settled in.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.399
I just wanted to say

06:19.400 --> 06:20.899
that I'm so thrilled to be
a part of your te--

06:20.900 --> 06:21.960
Yeah, you're happy
as a clam.

06:21.970 --> 06:23.200
Let's get one thing
straight.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.079
You may have filled
Donna's shoes with Harvey,

06:25.080 --> 06:27.245
but it's not gonna be that easy
filling them with me.

06:27.246 --> 06:29.909
Well, if that's how
you want to play it.

06:29.910 --> 06:32.570
I already know that.
I heard all about you.

06:32.580 --> 06:33.940
Yeah?
From Donna?

06:33.950 --> 06:35.019
From Norma.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.419
What?

06:36.420 --> 06:37.420
You knew Norma?

06:37.421 --> 06:39.180
Damn Skippy.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.625
Played mah-jongg
with that woman

06:40.626 --> 06:43.189
every Tuesday night
for the last 30 years.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.750
Mrs. Fillstein's game
on 81st Street?

06:44.760 --> 06:45.990
The very one.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.370
I've been trying to get
into that game forever.

06:47.371 --> 06:49.660
You know she kept you out,
right?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.369
Ah--

06:51.370 --> 06:52.599
Norma did that to me?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.830
Well, I can't say
as I blame her.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.180
Said it was her only
peaceful night of the week.

06:57.181 --> 07:00.000
30 seconds in,
I can see what she means.

07:00.010 --> 07:02.179
But you could
turn this around.

07:02.180 --> 07:05.749
Play your tiles right with me,
I could put in a word for you.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.049
Oh, anything you could do
would be so appreciated.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.310
Yeah.
That's more like it.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.380
I can do even better.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.589
Please, make yourself at home.
Take the day.

07:15.590 --> 07:19.820
Well, in that case,
I'll see you tomorrow morning,

07:19.830 --> 07:21.230
bright and early.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.400
You're here.
I am.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.670
It's good to have you back,
Harvey.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.309
Good to be back,
Donna.

07:37.310 --> 07:38.740
All right,
enough sentimentality.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.979
I need you to--

07:39.980 --> 07:41.880
Clear your schedule for
the next two months? Done.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.289
I also gave half your business
to the partners that backed you

07:44.290 --> 07:45.959
and the rest
to Jessica and Louis.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.159
I didn't ask you
to do that.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.689
No, you asked me
to come back to your desk.

07:50.690 --> 07:53.420
I sure as hell did.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.699
What's next?

07:54.700 --> 07:57.029
What's next is,
get Mike into this office,

07:57.030 --> 07:58.490
and I don't want him wearing
casual clothes;

07:58.500 --> 08:00.330
I want him
with his Superman outfit on.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.569
He's gonna need
a hell of a lot more

08:01.570 --> 08:03.230
than a cape and some tights,
because I just got

08:03.240 --> 08:05.539
a special delivery
from the U.S. Attorney's office.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.370
Don't tell me;
she's issued subpoenas

08:07.380 --> 08:08.979
for every case
Mike's ever touched.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.620
She issued subpoenas
for anything

08:10.621 --> 08:13.410
anyone at this firm
has ever touched.

08:13.420 --> 08:14.619
What does that mean?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.389
It means they're not just
after Mike anymore.

08:17.390 --> 08:20.259
They're officially
coming after all of us.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.330
Mike's already here.
I'll get him.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.359
I'm telling you, Harvey,
this move is no joke.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.590
That woman gets in the door,
she will find something

08:28.600 --> 08:31.699
to pressure someone into saying
whatever she wants,

08:31.700 --> 08:33.899
and I'll be damned if I'll
let her rifle through my house.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.100
What exactly
are you saying?

08:35.110 --> 08:37.409
I'm saying we need
outside counsel.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.779
Absolutely not.
There's nobody we can trust.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.379
There is one person
we can trust,

08:41.380 --> 08:43.448
because you already told her
Mike's goddamn secret.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.749
Jessica, I am not bringing
Scottie into this thing.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.119
I'm telling you
I can handle this.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.089
You don't even have a strategy
to stop these subpoenas.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.619
Well, then I guess
it's a good thing I do.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.550
Well, then why don't you stop
patting yourself on the back

08:54.560 --> 08:55.929
and start telling me
what the hell it is?

08:55.930 --> 08:57.229
We go on offense.

08:57.230 --> 08:58.699
What exactly
does that mean?

08:58.700 --> 09:00.129
It means that
we don't have to prove

09:00.130 --> 09:01.729
that she can't subpoena
our records;

09:01.730 --> 09:03.629
she has to prove
that she can.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.190
And she doesn't have
a shred of evidence

09:05.200 --> 09:06.560
proving that you knew
about me.

09:06.570 --> 09:08.269
If she got those subpoenas
in the first place,

09:08.270 --> 09:09.530
she must have something.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.009
Wrong, I worked
in the D.A.'s office

09:11.010 --> 09:12.639
for five years.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.600
Judges give out subpoenas
like candy.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.740
Then I suggest the two of you
get the hell on down there

09:16.750 --> 09:18.920
and take
that woman's candy away.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.589
The fact is, Your Honor,
she has no grounds

09:23.590 --> 09:25.419
to even issue these things
in the first place.

09:25.420 --> 09:26.650
What is he even
doing here?

09:26.660 --> 09:27.730
I'm here
because I'm a lawyer

09:27.731 --> 09:29.280
and I'm innocent
until proven guilty.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.050
And those subpoenas aren't
about coming after me;

09:31.060 --> 09:32.520
they're about
coming after him.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.970
You're damn right they are,
because there's no way

09:33.971 --> 09:35.360
he didn't know
you're a fraud.

09:35.370 --> 09:37.999
Where exactly is your evidence
of either one of those things?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.599
I see. They're not trying
to fight these subpoenas.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.430
They're trying to get me to turn
over whatever evidence I have,

09:43.440 --> 09:45.879
which I don't have to do
for another three weeks.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.879
You'll do whatever I say
you have to do.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.279
Now, I want to know
what started this whole thing.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.349
We received an anonymous email
from a reputable source.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.389
Yeah, and a stranger
called me the other day

09:55.390 --> 09:56.789
saying you killed
six people.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.389
Can I subpoena her bank records?

09:58.390 --> 09:59.659
You think this is
a joke?

09:59.660 --> 10:01.130
You're damn right
this isn't a joke.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.220
I'm being accused of a crime
based on some bullshit email

10:03.230 --> 10:04.529
no one's even seen.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.629
I'd ask if you have that email
on you, Ms. Gibbs,

10:06.630 --> 10:08.929
but I wouldn't want to put you
in the position of lying to me,

10:08.930 --> 10:10.190
so let's have it.

10:13.200 --> 10:20.300
<i>♪
♪</i>

10:20.310 --> 10:23.115
This is from a general
Harvard faculty address.

10:23.116 --> 10:26.340
It is. We are working
on tracking down the sender.

10:26.350 --> 10:27.719
Well, you'd better
find them,

10:27.720 --> 10:29.789
because without
corroborating testimony,

10:29.790 --> 10:31.989
I'll not only quash
these subpoenas;

10:31.990 --> 10:33.789
I'll toss the entire case.

10:33.790 --> 10:38.799
<i>♪
♪</i>

10:38.800 --> 10:41.559
Son of a bitch.
It's Henry Gerard.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.390
Harvey, if Gerard was gonna
say something,

10:43.400 --> 10:44.699
why would he wait
until now?

10:44.700 --> 10:46.260
I don't know,
but it's the only goddamn person

10:46.270 --> 10:47.469
it could be.

10:47.470 --> 10:48.569
All right, then I'm gonna
go see him.

10:48.570 --> 10:49.800
And do what?

10:49.810 --> 10:51.139
I'm gonna get to him
before Gibbs does,

10:51.140 --> 10:52.130
get him to recant.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.400
This isn't testimony.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.179
It's a tip to a crime
you actually committed.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.249
I don't care.
We have leverage on Gerard.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.349
Were you in there?

10:58.350 --> 11:00.485
This woman has her sights
on both of us.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.340
You go up to Boston,
she's gonna have people

11:02.350 --> 11:03.780
crawling all over Harvard,

11:03.790 --> 11:05.419
and you're gonna be the one
who led her to Gerard.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.380
I can't just sit here and wait
for the sword to drop.

11:07.390 --> 11:08.489
Wait a second.

11:08.490 --> 11:12.650
You can't go there,
I can't go there,

11:12.660 --> 11:14.060
but I know someone
who can.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.060
Jessica.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.409
I was wondering when you were
gonna show up at my door.

11:22.410 --> 11:23.809
So you've heard
about Mike Ross.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.609
Oh, everybody's heard
about Mike Ross.

11:26.610 --> 11:29.979
Now I finally know what you were
hiding from me the whole time.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.609
But what I don't know
is how the hell

11:31.610 --> 11:33.810
you let something like this
happen in the first place.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.889
We'll talk about that
in a minute.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.989
But I'm not just here
to apologize

11:37.990 --> 11:39.889
for what happened between us.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.789
I'm here to ask for your help.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.720
You want me to represent
the firm.

11:44.730 --> 11:48.170
If it comes to it,
I want you to represent me.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.369
You got a lot of nerve
coming in here to ask me that.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.799
Jeff, please.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.500
I made the mistake
of not trusting you once.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.839
I don't want to make
that same mistake again.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.470
Then you're gonna have to tell
me the truth about everything

12:00.480 --> 12:03.120
right now, and it's not
gonna be protected

12:03.121 --> 12:05.140
by attorney-client privilege,

12:05.150 --> 12:07.790
and you're gonna have to trust
that I'm not gonna turn you in.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.380
I was never worried that
you were gonna turn me in.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.159
I was worried about
putting you in a position

12:13.160 --> 12:16.159
where you had to lie.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.029
But I was ready to tell you
that night anyway,

12:19.030 --> 12:22.100
so I might as well
tell you now.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.250
Rachel,
what's going on?

12:33.251 --> 12:34.600
I just got a call.

12:34.610 --> 12:36.670
They took Donna down to
the U.S. Attorney's office.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.120
We have to get down there
right now.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.010
No, we don't.
I'm gonna take care of her.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.989
You go ahead and do what
we were gonna do together.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.689
Harvey, Donna getting
taken in changes everything.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.559
It changes nothing,
so stop talking to me

12:45.560 --> 12:47.490
and do what you
have to do.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.169
- It was Henry Gerard.
- What?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.739
The person who handed me in
was Henry Gerard.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.139
It was an anonymous email.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.309
No way. How would he even know
that you're not a lawyer?

13:03.310 --> 13:05.709
That case we took last year,
he figured it out.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.549
Well, then why would he wait
to turn you in now?

13:07.550 --> 13:08.949
I don't know,
but what I do know is,

13:08.950 --> 13:10.979
you need to get up there and you
need to get him to take it back.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.440
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

13:12.450 --> 13:13.919
That's what you and I are
gonna figure out right now.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.919
Wait a second.
Where's Harvey?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.659
He's got an important
meeting that--

13:17.660 --> 13:18.830
What could be
more important than this?

13:18.820 --> 13:19.820
Louis,
it's a personal matter--

13:19.821 --> 13:22.789
Where is he?

13:22.790 --> 13:24.390
They brought Donna in
for questioning.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.999
Goddamn it, this is
what I was afraid of.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.229
I'm heading down there
right now.

13:27.230 --> 13:28.720
Louis--Louis,
listen to me.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.229
They're gonna try and put
pressure on Donna

13:30.230 --> 13:31.560
to turn on Harvey,
and the best way

13:31.570 --> 13:34.139
to make that pressure go away
is to make Gerard go away,

13:34.140 --> 13:37.239
which can make this whole case
go away.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.770
Give me the goddamn email.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.740
Now, before you go up there,
we're gonna--

13:45.750 --> 13:47.249
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.149
Why would someone who knows
you're guilty

13:49.150 --> 13:50.880
call you
a "potential" fraud?

13:50.890 --> 13:52.119
I-I don't know.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.419
He's trying
to cover his ass somehow.

13:53.420 --> 13:56.520
"A potential fraud besmirching
the sacrosanct name

13:56.530 --> 13:58.029
of hallowed
Harvard University"--

13:58.030 --> 14:01.100
Louis, we really don't
have time for this. Please.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.240
Mike, I know who wrote
this email.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.010
It's not Henry Gerard.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.270
Excuse me, miss.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.420
Are you alone, or can
an old man pull up a seat?

14:17.980 --> 14:20.040
Hi, Dad.
Oh.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.719
So have you
looked over the deal?

14:24.720 --> 14:25.880
I have.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.829
And you see the potential
I'm talking about?

14:27.830 --> 14:30.200
It's a great project.

14:30.201 --> 14:33.529
But?

14:33.530 --> 14:34.629
I'm not sure
how wise it is

14:34.630 --> 14:37.060
for you to get
back into development.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.539
I understand you would
feel that way

14:38.540 --> 14:39.810
after what it did to you,
but--

14:39.811 --> 14:41.700
I feel that way
because of what it did to you.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.009
Donna, I told you.

14:43.010 --> 14:45.779
The banks are crazy for
this kind of thing right now.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.609
All I need is $250,000.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.309
I can get a loan
five times the size.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.110
I don't know; that just
sounds really risky.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.949
Aren't you always telling me
that Harvey says

14:52.950 --> 14:55.789
if you want to get ahead,
you need to take risks?

14:55.790 --> 14:59.289
That's why
you came to me.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.729
You're not looking for my money;
you're looking for Harvey's.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.489
It would just be
to secure the loan.

15:03.490 --> 15:05.090
After the bank gives me
the money, he's free and clear.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.499
Harvey's never gonna
go for that.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.069
I mean, even I know
that's not legal.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.040
Donna, people do
this kind of thing all the time.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.060
It's a sleight of hand,
nothing more.

15:12.070 --> 15:16.069
Dad, you're doing fine.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.970
Do you really need to risk
everything again?

15:17.980 --> 15:21.379
Donna, I manage
a real estate office.

15:21.380 --> 15:26.249
Everybody there makes more.
Everybody there is doing better.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.449
I used to be better.

15:28.450 --> 15:29.980
I know I can do this.

15:29.990 --> 15:33.059
Please, all you have to do
is ask Harvey.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.090
If he says no,
he says no.

15:37.900 --> 15:41.169
Dad, I'm so sorry.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.099
Don't worry, sweetie.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.239
People have tried to rattle
my cage plenty of times.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.309
It's never worked before,
and it's not gonna work now.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.839
That's what I told her.
You're gonna be okay.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.270
Donna, can you
give us a minute?

15:55.480 --> 15:58.079
Harvey...

15:58.080 --> 15:59.540
Yeah?

15:59.550 --> 16:01.089
They're saying
this has to do with that deal

16:01.090 --> 16:02.519
I talked to you about
seven years ago.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.619
And?

16:03.620 --> 16:05.559
Is there something
you're not telling me?

16:05.560 --> 16:06.989
The only thing
I haven't told you

16:06.990 --> 16:09.120
is that I'm gonna get him
out of this, no matter what.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.705
What the hell did you do?

16:19.706 --> 16:21.130
What are you
talking about?

16:21.140 --> 16:22.880
They didn't bring you in here
if you didn't do something

16:22.870 --> 16:24.530
seven years ago, and if
I'm gonna get you out of this,

16:24.540 --> 16:25.970
I need to know
what you did.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.009
I did what
everybody else did.

16:28.010 --> 16:30.370
I inflated my collateral
because you shut me down,

16:30.380 --> 16:32.540
so don't come in here telling me
this is my fault.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.249
I shut you down
to protect Donna

16:34.250 --> 16:36.810
from getting involved
in exactly something like this.

16:36.820 --> 16:38.319
This is on you,
not on me.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.150
Well, aren't you
high and mighty,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.859
coming in here accusing me
of putting my daughter at risk

16:43.860 --> 16:46.190
when the whole reason
she's in the position she's in

16:46.200 --> 16:48.669
is because of
something you did?

16:48.670 --> 16:49.899
That's right.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.299
They told me this is
because they're trying

16:51.300 --> 16:53.460
to get Donna to testify
against you,

16:53.470 --> 16:55.639
and they want me to help them
get her to do it.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.239
Then why don't you?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.170
Because I know
it would kill her,

16:59.180 --> 17:01.549
and no matter what
you may think,

17:01.550 --> 17:04.050
I would never do anything
to hurt my daughter.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.589
Did you talk to Donna?

17:09.589 --> 17:11.759
I talked to Harvey, and
he said it's gonna be f--

17:11.760 --> 17:12.760
I don't care what he says.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
What are they
coming after her for?

17:13.761 --> 17:14.858
Mike, Harvey asked me
not to--

17:14.859 --> 17:16.628
Rachel, what are they
coming after her for?

17:16.630 --> 17:18.299
They're not coming after her
for anything.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.670
They're coming
after her father.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.060
What?

17:21.069 --> 17:22.569
Turns out he was involved
in some sort of real estate deal

17:22.569 --> 17:23.699
and they're saying it wasn't
on the up-and-up.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.769
Goddamn it!

17:24.770 --> 17:27.098
Mike, calm down.
It's nothing.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.630
Harvey's gonna get them
out of it.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.079
Look, it's really
just a minor violation,

17:31.080 --> 17:33.510
and no one would even care
if it weren't for--

17:34.850 --> 17:37.020
Me. You were just about to say
if it weren't for me.

17:37.021 --> 17:38.021
- Mike, I--
- That's it.

17:38.022 --> 17:39.149
I'm pleading guilty.

17:39.150 --> 17:40.319
I'm gonna take
the reduced sentence,

17:40.320 --> 17:41.320
I'm gonna do the time,
and all of this

17:41.321 --> 17:42.619
is gonna go away
once and for all.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.489
That's not an option,
and you know it.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.459
The only reason
they went after Donna's dad

17:46.460 --> 17:47.989
is to get to Harvey
and Jessica.

17:47.990 --> 17:50.550
If you plead guilty, all you're
gonna do is help them do that,

17:50.560 --> 17:52.620
so you're either gonna
turn on the two of them

17:52.630 --> 17:55.599
or you're gonna fight this thing
out till the end.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.069
We need to talk.

17:57.070 --> 17:58.099
About what?

17:58.100 --> 17:59.299
About what we're
going to do

17:59.300 --> 18:01.460
if that prosecutor
gets ahold of those subpoenas.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.869
You mean what we're gonna do
about the letter that Mike has

18:03.870 --> 18:05.470
that proves you knew
he was a fraud.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.009
Yes, that's what I mean.

18:08.010 --> 18:09.440
I'm assuming you were
smart enough

18:09.450 --> 18:11.249
to destroy that thing
the second they let you out.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.890
And I'm assuming you
destroyed the affidavit

18:12.891 --> 18:15.880
that you had Rachel sign saying
she knew the truth about me.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.689
I didn't,

18:17.690 --> 18:20.059
but I had the same conversation
with Louis, we worked it out,

18:20.060 --> 18:21.159
and I'm here to tell you

18:21.160 --> 18:23.330
I will get rid of mine
if you get rid of yours.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.799
I knew it;
you're actually considering

18:26.800 --> 18:28.499
turning your back
on me and Harvey.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.969
I'm not turning my back
on anyone,

18:29.970 --> 18:31.539
but we both know
you've done some things

18:31.540 --> 18:34.069
that make me question
whether or not I can trust you.

18:34.070 --> 18:36.600
Well, then,
the least you can do

18:36.610 --> 18:39.079
is find the time to speak
with my attorney

18:39.080 --> 18:40.750
before that ruling
comes down.

18:40.751 --> 18:41.840
Your attorney?

18:41.850 --> 18:43.849
I'm sure
you've heard of him.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.750
His name's Jeff Malone.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.550
You're even lower
than I thought you were,

18:51.560 --> 18:53.259
and I didn't even think
that was possible.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.729
Coming from someone
with your moral compass,

18:54.730 --> 18:55.959
I take that
as a compliment.

18:55.960 --> 18:56.995
What gives you the right

18:56.996 --> 18:58.590
to come after
my secretary's father?

18:58.600 --> 18:59.729
I'm not the one
prosecuting him.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.269
It just so happens that
one of my colleagues

19:01.270 --> 19:03.769
is going after him on
a completely unrelated matter.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.569
Bullshit, the only reason
you're doing this

19:05.570 --> 19:07.909
is to put pressure on Donna
to come after me.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.239
Well, now that you mention it,
the judge did say

19:10.240 --> 19:12.745
I needed something tying you
to Mike Ross's fraud

19:12.746 --> 19:14.139
in order to get
those subpoenas,

19:14.140 --> 19:16.070
and maybe that something
is Donna Paulsen.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
I should ask her.

19:17.081 --> 19:18.219
You already did ask her,

19:18.220 --> 19:19.449
and now you're
manufacturing

19:19.450 --> 19:21.549
a bullshit case
against an innocent man,

19:21.550 --> 19:23.449
and I'm gonna make sure
you pay for it.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.310
He's not in here
because of what I did.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.219
He's in here
because of what you did.

19:27.220 --> 19:29.750
So instead of blaming me,
take a look in the mirror,

19:29.760 --> 19:32.699
'cause all you have to do
is admit what you did,

19:32.700 --> 19:34.470
and all of this
goes away.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.530
I got a call
about an article

20:14.540 --> 20:17.675
on Mike Ross's meteoric rise
to junior partner.

20:17.676 --> 20:18.900
Problem is, I remember

20:18.910 --> 20:21.050
every student
that's ever gone here,

20:21.051 --> 20:23.509
and there is no Mike Ross,

20:23.510 --> 20:26.879
so I double-checked
my file room,

20:26.880 --> 20:28.140
and then I sent this.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.210
Sheila, you are
messing with my firm.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.959
Why didn't you
come to me first?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.689
Because it didn't occur to me
that I had to.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.529
That is bullshit!

20:36.530 --> 20:38.329
You reported it
anonymously

20:38.330 --> 20:39.599
because you didn't want
to look bad.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.170
You didn't trust me
to keep you out of it.

20:41.171 --> 20:42.729
No, I reported it
anonymously

20:42.730 --> 20:45.560
because I was ashamed that
it happened on my watch,

20:45.570 --> 20:48.169
but I'm not gonna stand by
while somebody besmirches

20:48.170 --> 20:50.169
the good name
of Harvard University.

20:50.170 --> 20:52.400
You have no proof that
Mike Ross besmirched anything.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.279
Why are you
defending this lowlife?

20:54.280 --> 20:55.579
Because if you'd
come to me first,

20:55.580 --> 20:58.179
I could have stopped
this whole thing from happening.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.240
Oh, my God.

21:02.290 --> 21:05.719
You knew.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.620
Sheila, please, you don't
know him like I know him.

21:08.630 --> 21:12.399
What exactly are you
doing here, Louis?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.470
I want you to retract
that email.

Tell 'em that you made
a mistake; you found the file.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.799
I can't do that.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.230
Sheila, please.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.079
When we broke up,
I forced myself to accept it,

21:26.080 --> 21:29.479
because ultimately I knew
we wanted different things,

21:29.480 --> 21:33.519
but it killed me, because I also
knew that we were soul mates.

21:33.520 --> 21:38.359
But the fact that you're
asking me to do this...

21:38.360 --> 21:41.430
We are not soul mates.

It's just, last year

and he told me that my worrying
about what would happen

more likely for him to lose.

but worry about it,

22:32.940 --> 22:34.000

Because if it
comes down to it,

you want Mike to consider

Are you sorry?

23:01.370 --> 23:02.360
Excuse me?

23:02.370 --> 23:03.569

that I don't know

23:03.570 --> 23:04.970
that all your problems
are solved

23:04.980 --> 23:06.479
if I tell them
that Harvey did this?

23:06.480 --> 23:09.415
No, Donna, all of my problems
are solved if Mike tells them.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.970
But, yes, my life gets
a whole lot better

23:11.980 --> 23:13.910
if Harvey takes responsibility
for what he did.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.089
What he did was
give Mike a chance

23:15.090 --> 23:16.389
to make something
of himself.

23:16.390 --> 23:19.689
Which is why Mike's never
gonna turn on him.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.059
But you know what?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.595
I would be lying if I said
it didn't cross my mind

23:23.596 --> 23:25.720
that maybe Mike should think
about making a deal.

23:25.730 --> 23:27.999
And you can't tell me that
since they picked up your father

23:28.000 --> 23:29.799
that the thought hasn't
crossed yours too.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.799
Well, thinking about it
and talking about it

23:31.800 --> 23:33.430
aren't the same thing,

23:33.440 --> 23:38.510

on having faith in Harvey.

I've been looking for you
all morning.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.279
What happened?
It was her.

23:48.690 --> 23:49.690
And?

23:49.691 --> 23:51.160
She's not gonna
retract the email.

23:51.161 --> 23:53.150

23:53.160 --> 23:55.289
Oh, what the hell
do you think she said?

23:55.290 --> 23:59.150
Said she knows you're a fraud,
she's not gonna take it back,

23:59.160 --> 24:01.020
and now that she's figured out
that I've been a part of it,

24:01.030 --> 24:02.460
she can't stand
the sight of me.

24:02.470 --> 24:03.940
All right, then we need

24:03.941 --> 24:05.790
Oh, did you just hear
what I just said?

24:05.800 --> 24:09.260
She can't stand
the sight of me.

24:09.270 --> 24:11.200
Louis, I know
you're feeling bad,

24:11.210 --> 24:13.009
but right now,
Donna is under the gun.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.479
What do you want me
to do about that?

24:14.480 --> 24:15.879
I don't know, but if she
doesn't retract that email

24:15.880 --> 24:16.880
and they find her--

24:16.881 --> 24:18.219
No, they're not gonna
find her,

24:18.220 --> 24:20.549
because she sent it
from a general faculty email

24:20.550 --> 24:23.489
because she's ashamed of herself
like she's ashamed of me.

24:23.490 --> 24:26.259

25:00.960 --> 25:03.059
It wasn't Gerard.
It was Sheila Sazs.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.689
You gotta be kidding me.

25:04.690 --> 25:06.150

about you?

25:06.160 --> 25:08.790
No, Harvey, you told
your girlfriend about me.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.469
Louis risked his neck
to get Sheila

25:10.470 --> 25:12.569

to save our asses.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.039
What are you
so bent out of shape for?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.939
I'm bent out of shape
because he couldn't do it,

25:15.940 --> 25:17.880
and on top of that, Donna's dad
is only in this mess

25:17.881 --> 25:20.300
because of what we did,
and you won't let me help.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.979
That's right, Mike;
I won't let you help,

25:21.980 --> 25:23.249
because you're
under investigation

25:23.250 --> 25:24.549
for being a fraud.

25:24.550 --> 25:25.949
You're under investigation
too, and if we're

25:25.950 --> 25:27.749
supposed to act like there's
nothing to be ashamed of,

25:27.750 --> 25:29.810
then let's act like there's
nothing to be ashamed of.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.519

26:46.330 --> 26:47.729
their whole case
gets dismissed.

26:47.730 --> 26:48.760
And what if it doesn't?

26:48.770 --> 26:50.269
Then I go to trial.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.439
This is reasonable doubt.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.210
I get acquitted,
they can never try me again.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.830
Or it's not reasonable doubt,
you don't get acquitted,

26:55.840 --> 26:57.239
and I go to jail
for perjury.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.039
I remember when you were
willing to commit perjury

26:59.040 --> 27:01.340
and we didn't just stop you;
we saved your ass.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.179
I don't care. I'm not
risking everything for you.

27:04.180 --> 27:06.679
This isn't just for me,
all right?

27:06.680 --> 27:09.780
They are coming after everyone
that I care about.

27:09.790 --> 27:12.019
I feel for you, Mike,

27:12.020 --> 27:14.050
which is why I never turned
you in in the first place,

27:14.060 --> 27:16.729
but I can't do
what you're asking.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.299
And what if I
anonymously told Harvard

27:18.300 --> 27:22.199
that you took a bribe
from a student for a grade?

27:22.200 --> 27:24.239
You willing to bet everything
that I won't do that?

27:24.240 --> 27:26.199
You do what you have to do,

27:26.200 --> 27:27.760
but I'm not putting
my life in jeopardy

27:27.770 --> 27:29.600
by signing
that goddamn thing.

27:31.510 --> 27:34.479
Wait a minute,
wait, wait.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.020
What if I had a way
that you could help me

27:36.021 --> 27:37.470
without having to
perjure yourself?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.440
And how exactly
would I do that?

27:39.450 --> 27:40.919
It's right
in your wheelhouse.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.460
We're playing poker too.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.050
I just--

27:45.060 --> 27:47.090
I just need you
to help me bluff.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.999
Harvey, I need to ask you
to do something.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.729
Of course, Donna.
I'd do anything for you.

27:54.730 --> 27:57.590
Well, it isn't for me.
It's for my father.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.760
He wanted to know
if you would consider

27:59.770 --> 28:03.269
investing
in his real estate project.

28:03.270 --> 28:04.430
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.970
You just said that you would
do anything for me.

28:05.980 --> 28:09.849
I meant I'd consider anything,
and I just did.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.379
You haven't even
looked at it.

28:11.380 --> 28:13.610
I don't need to.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.755
You're family to me,
he's family to you,

28:15.756 --> 28:17.980
and you don't invest money
with family.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.059
That's not what you said

28:19.060 --> 28:20.389
when Marcus needed money
for his restaurant.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.050
- That's different.
- Why?

28:22.060 --> 28:24.300
Because Marcus actually knew
what the hell he was doing.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.629
You know what, Harvey?

28:27.630 --> 28:29.229
If you don't want to invest,
don't invest,

28:29.230 --> 28:30.730
but I don't need
a lecture from you

28:30.740 --> 28:33.710
on what a bad businessman
my father is.

28:34.970 --> 28:36.069
Yes, you do.

28:36.070 --> 28:37.130
Oh, really?
Why's that?

28:37.140 --> 28:38.570
Because if I know you,

28:38.580 --> 28:40.809
you're thinking of giving him
access to your 401.

28:40.810 --> 28:42.140
So? What if I am?

28:42.150 --> 28:44.919
Donna, this man lost
your family's money once.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.549
You're gonna give him
the chance to do it again?

28:46.550 --> 28:48.819
Harvey,
this man is my father,

28:48.820 --> 28:50.859
and he has been there for me
my whole life.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.059
And I know what happened
between you and your mother,

28:53.060 --> 28:54.989
but don't you judge him
for what she did.

28:54.990 --> 28:57.450
How dare you? This has
nothing to do with that.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.220
You have a blind spot
when it comes to him.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.429
I'm trying to protect you.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.460
Well, you're not.
You're being an asshole.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.869
And for your information,
keeping me from being there

29:05.870 --> 29:07.769
for my father
isn't protecting me.

29:07.770 --> 29:10.170
It's pissing me
the hell off.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.519
Good, Donna, you're here.
Look, I need you to--

29:19.520 --> 29:22.549
The only thing I need is
for you to tell me what you did,

29:22.550 --> 29:23.780
because I just found out
that they're

29:23.790 --> 29:25.959
formally charging my father
with bank fraud tomorrow.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.859
Goddamn it.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.159
What did you do?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.229
All I did was
strong-arm a banker.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.399
And why the hell would you
need to strong-arm a banker?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.635
Because he had evidence
that needed to get lost.

29:35.636 --> 29:38.590
I knew there was something
you weren't telling me.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.599
What the hell happened
seven years ago?

29:40.600 --> 29:41.930
What happened is,
you came to me

29:41.940 --> 29:44.339
asking a favor for your father,
so I went to him

29:44.340 --> 29:45.800
asking a favor of my own.

29:45.810 --> 29:47.849
Bullshit.
You don't ask people for favors.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.479
You force them to do things!

29:49.480 --> 29:50.715
You're goddamn right I do.

29:50.716 --> 29:52.679
I told your father
if he took your money,

29:52.680 --> 29:55.240
I'd pull every string I have
to shut his deal down.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.119
You had no right
to do that.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.880
I don't care if I had
a right to do it or not.

30:00.890 --> 30:02.420
I wasn't gonna let you
lose everything

30:02.430 --> 30:04.100
just because you couldn't see
the truth about him.

30:04.101 --> 30:06.090
The truth is, you went
behind my back,

30:06.100 --> 30:07.529
and then he did
something illegal,

30:07.530 --> 30:09.929
and now I have to choose
between you and him

30:09.930 --> 30:11.160
because of what you did!

30:11.170 --> 30:12.469
What I did was keep you

30:12.470 --> 30:13.869
from being involved
in this mess.

30:13.870 --> 30:16.769
No, Harvey, what you did
was start this mess

30:16.770 --> 30:19.370
the day you went ahead
and hired a fraud.

30:28.150 --> 30:29.449
What happened?

30:29.450 --> 30:31.310
They're formally charging
Donna's father,

30:31.320 --> 30:33.619
and we need to figure out a way
to get his case thrown out.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.380
Well, then we have to get
my case thrown out,

30:35.390 --> 30:37.820
because then they won't care
about Donna's dad.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.199
And how the hell are we
gonna do that?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.559
I went to see Gerard.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.190
God damn it, didn't I
tell you not to do that?

30:42.200 --> 30:43.840
That was before we knew
he wasn't the one

30:43.841 --> 30:45.160
that tipped them off.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.405
If he wasn't the one
who tipped them off,

30:47.406 --> 30:49.730
what the hell
did you go to him for?

30:49.740 --> 30:51.440
I went to him for this.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.310
This is a vaguely worded
statement.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.589
It doesn't even specifically say
you went to Harvard.

31:01.590 --> 31:02.889
It doesn't have to.

31:02.890 --> 31:04.819
It says that he's known me
to be an amazing lawyer,

31:04.820 --> 31:07.180
that I've shown mastery
of the material that he teaches,

31:07.190 --> 31:08.520
and that as far
as he's concerned,

31:08.530 --> 31:10.129
I'm an outstanding student
of the law.

31:10.130 --> 31:11.299
It's total bullshit.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.759
It's not total bullshit,
all right?

31:12.760 --> 31:14.320
If they don't find Sheila
and we do this,

31:14.330 --> 31:15.660
we could get
the whole case thrown out.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.299
Gibbs'll see
right through this.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.460
She'll put Gerard on the stand,
and she'll ask him point blank

31:20.470 --> 31:22.869
if he knows for a fact
that you never went to Harvard,

31:22.870 --> 31:24.630
and we'll have signed
our own death warrant.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.100
She's not gonna do that,
because it violates

31:26.110 --> 31:28.509
the number one rule of being
a lawyer that you taught me:

31:28.510 --> 31:30.470
don't ask a question that
you don't have the answer to.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.610
It's too big a risk.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.285
Harvey, Donna's dad
is at risk,

31:33.286 --> 31:35.010
and he's at risk
because of me.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.089
The only way to get him out
is to have me to turn on you

31:37.090 --> 31:38.789
or for us to get
this whole thing thrown out,

31:38.790 --> 31:41.489
so are you on board
with this or not?

31:41.490 --> 31:43.389
We better pray
this bullshit works,

31:43.390 --> 31:45.150
because, if it doesn't,
at least one of us

31:45.160 --> 31:47.620
is gonna end up
in prison tomorrow.

31:47.630 --> 31:50.629
All right,
what are we doing here?

31:50.630 --> 31:54.330
Your Honor, we have a motion
to dismiss Mike Ross's case.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.439
On what grounds?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.009
On the grounds that
I have a letter here

31:57.010 --> 32:00.239
from Professor Henry Gerard
of Harvard Law

32:00.240 --> 32:02.170
saying that Mike Ross
was in his class.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.349
This is ridiculous.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.079
Even if Mr. Ross
were in that class,

32:05.080 --> 32:06.810
it doesn't mean
he was matriculated.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.355
You still haven't shown
any evidence that he wasn't,

32:09.356 --> 32:12.280
which is why that document
should get this case dismissed.

32:12.290 --> 32:13.759
This document is

32:13.760 --> 32:15.229
a cryptically worded
piece of shit,

32:15.230 --> 32:16.559
and you're a man
who has a reputation

32:16.560 --> 32:17.629
for crossing the line.

32:17.630 --> 32:20.429
Ms. Gibbs, language.
What are you implying?

32:20.430 --> 32:22.120
Your Honor,
there's a good chance

32:22.130 --> 32:25.760
he coerced this Professor Gerard
into signing this thing.

32:25.770 --> 32:28.139
So our exhibits are
all from blackmail,

32:28.140 --> 32:30.575
but yours are squeaky clean
because you're Mother Teresa?

32:30.576 --> 32:31.930
I may not be
Mother Teresa,

32:31.940 --> 32:33.970
but I don't resort to coercion
to get my evidence.

32:33.980 --> 32:35.079
Then what exactly
are you doing

32:35.080 --> 32:36.279
with Donna Paulsen's father?

32:36.280 --> 32:37.879
Care to tell me
what he's talking about?

32:37.880 --> 32:39.779
I'll tell you.
She fabricated a charge

32:39.780 --> 32:43.210
against an innocent businessman
to pressure my secretary

32:43.220 --> 32:45.489
into giving false testimony
against me.

32:45.490 --> 32:46.989
Your Honor,
it's standard practice

32:46.990 --> 32:49.289
to find leverage
against a vital witness.

32:49.290 --> 32:50.689
Oh, is it also standard
practice to have

32:50.690 --> 32:53.120
a federal marshal rough me up
in a holding cell?

32:53.130 --> 32:56.635
Ms. Gibbs, if I find out
there's an abuse of power here,

32:56.636 --> 32:58.660
I will be switching
my focus to you.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.905
Then before you rule
on their motion,

33:00.906 --> 33:02.060
the state has the right

33:02.070 --> 33:04.430
to question
this Professor Gerard.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.520
Your Honor, can Ms. Gibbs
and I have a minute alone?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.940
Please.

33:11.950 --> 33:14.849
You think I don't know this
letter is complete bullshit?

33:14.850 --> 33:16.310
I pull this clown
up on the stand,

33:16.320 --> 33:17.889
he's gonna tell me
the truth in a minute.

33:17.890 --> 33:19.459
Okay,
this clown is one of

33:19.460 --> 33:22.229
the most distinguished ethics
professors in the country.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.259
You put him up there,
this case is over for you

33:24.260 --> 33:25.520
before you even get started.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.129
Then why the hell
isn't he here right now

33:27.130 --> 33:28.290
verifying this thing?

33:28.300 --> 33:30.299
Because that kid cares
more about Donna Paulsen

33:30.300 --> 33:31.669
than he does about himself.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.039
What do you want?

33:33.040 --> 33:35.780
I want to make a deal--
that letter for Donna's father.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.770
This is too good for you.

33:38.780 --> 33:42.279
If you really had Gerard,
he'd be down here right now.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.779
If it were up to me,
he'd be down here right now,

33:44.780 --> 33:46.510
but this is Mike's call.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.319
This is a one-time offer,
and the clock's ticking.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.855
You still get to go
to trial,

33:50.856 --> 33:52.980
we get Donna and her father
off limits,

33:52.990 --> 33:54.989
and we both live
to fight another day.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.689
I want my subpoenas too.

33:56.690 --> 33:58.420
No way.
Judge said no.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.429
You try to pull this thing
out at trial,

34:02.430 --> 34:05.090
I will rip your professor friend
to shreds.

34:08.340 --> 34:12.179
Your Honor, Ms. Gibbs and I
have come to an agreement.

34:12.179 --> 34:14.809
She's dropping all charges
against James Paulsen,

34:14.810 --> 34:17.010
and we withdraw
our motion to dismiss.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.859
See you next week.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.989
Nice club.

34:24.989 --> 34:26.089
Are you new?

34:26.090 --> 34:27.920
Just visiting.
Not much of a golfer.

34:27.929 --> 34:30.259
Unfortunately,
neither am I.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.590
Harvey Specter.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.958
Jim Paulsen.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.520
I assume this is
about the opportunity

34:34.530 --> 34:35.960
Donna brought you.

34:35.969 --> 34:37.599
It'd be an opportunity
if the numbers added up, Jim,

34:37.600 --> 34:38.860
but they don't.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.639
I don't understand.

34:40.639 --> 34:41.880
I thought you were
the type of man

34:41.880 --> 34:43.230
that was willing
to take risks.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.539
I am--but not if it puts
people I care about in jeopardy,

34:46.540 --> 34:47.900
which is why I'm here
to tell you

34:47.909 --> 34:50.210
that when Donna
offers you her 401,

34:50.219 --> 34:51.790
you're gonna tell her
you don't need it anymore.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.480
No offense, Mr. Specter,
but what my daughter does

34:54.489 --> 34:56.319
with her money is
none of your business.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.580
Well, it became my business
when Donna put you

34:58.590 --> 35:00.859
so far up on a pedestal
that she couldn't smell

35:00.860 --> 35:02.359
the bullshit
you were dishing out.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.859
It's not bullshit.

35:03.860 --> 35:05.390
Yes, it is.
I looked at that deal.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.199
There's no way you're getting
the kind of money you need

35:07.200 --> 35:08.735
without doing
something shady.

35:08.736 --> 35:11.630
Inflating my assets
to get a loan isn't shady.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.069
Everybody does it.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.769
That's what everybody thinks
until the music stops,

35:15.770 --> 35:18.000
which is why if you involve
Donna in this deal,

35:18.010 --> 35:20.179
so help me God, I will pull
every string I have

35:20.180 --> 35:24.349
to tie your project up in court
for the next 20 years.

35:24.350 --> 35:26.119
I'm just trying
to make my way.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.989
All I'm telling you is,
you can make it without Donna.

35:29.990 --> 35:34.329
You act as if you think
I don't love my own daughter.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.589
People who love
other people

35:36.590 --> 35:39.660
don't put them in positions
to break the law.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.760
I just got off the phone
with my dad.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.169
He told me the good news.

35:49.170 --> 35:50.930
I told you
I'd take care of it.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.500
What did you do?

35:52.510 --> 35:53.749
It's not important.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.009
Harvey.

35:55.010 --> 35:57.610
We withdrew our motion
to dismiss Mike's case

35:57.620 --> 35:59.785
in exchange for her
leaving you alone.

35:59.786 --> 36:01.240
So I hurt Mike's case.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.480
No, you didn't.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.359
The whole thing was based
on a bluff

36:04.360 --> 36:06.659
that never would have
held up anyway.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.199
This way, we at least got
something for it.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.270
Thank you, Harvey.

36:15.100 --> 36:17.539
And I'm sorry
for what I said.

36:17.540 --> 36:19.069
No.

36:19.070 --> 36:21.609
You were right to say it.

36:21.610 --> 36:24.909
I never should have put you
in this position, Donna.

36:24.910 --> 36:27.449
If you want to go back to work
for Louis, I'll understand.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.349
No, you shouldn't have put me
in that position,

36:29.350 --> 36:31.179
but if I was gonna leave you
for hiring Mike,

36:31.180 --> 36:34.440
the time to do that
would have been years ago.

36:36.090 --> 36:38.859
I hope I'm not interrupting
your premature celebration.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.859
You better not be
reneging on our deal.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.229
Oh, no, I'm gonna honor it.

36:42.230 --> 36:45.599
I just dropped by
to serve you with these.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.240
You and your partners are
hereby subpoenaed

36:48.241 --> 36:52.230
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.240
No.

36:53.241 --> 36:54.669
No way the judge
granted that

36:54.670 --> 36:57.230
just because we withdrew
our motion to dismiss.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.470
She didn't.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.509
She granted it when
a Sheila Sazs from Harvard

37:01.510 --> 37:05.679
came forward and said she wrote
that anonymous email.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.879
That's right, Mr. Specter.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.580
Your chances of winning
this case just took

37:08.590 --> 37:11.660
a mighty big turn
for the worse.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.090
What are you doing here?

37:21.100 --> 37:22.140
You never came
to see me,

37:22.141 --> 37:23.830
so I thought I would
come to you

37:23.840 --> 37:25.169
and find out why
you're so willing

37:25.170 --> 37:26.605
to let all those
dangerous letters

37:26.606 --> 37:28.330
just keep floating around
out there.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.839
I think you mean letters that
are dangerous to your client.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.200
Well, I'm holding one
right here

37:32.210 --> 37:34.109
that puts your woman
in a world of trouble, Mike,

37:34.110 --> 37:36.509
so no, no, I don't.

37:36.510 --> 37:38.070
Oh, I get it.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.910
I didn't crumble to Jessica,
so now you're here

37:39.920 --> 37:42.260
to take a shot at
strong-arming me into a trade.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.350
No, see,
I came to see why,

37:44.360 --> 37:47.059
when the woman that's been
protecting you for so long

37:47.060 --> 37:49.989
asks you for a simple
gesture of trust,

37:49.990 --> 37:52.459
you seem to think that all she's
doing is protecting herself.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.020
Because she is
protecting herself.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.760
You're goddamn right
that's what she's doing,

37:55.770 --> 37:57.139
but that's not all
she's doing,

37:57.140 --> 37:59.310
because from the second
that she found out about you,

37:59.311 --> 38:01.100
she's had to lie for you,

38:01.110 --> 38:03.439
and she still treated you
like family,

38:03.440 --> 38:05.070
and it cost her
everything.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.549
Give me a break. Until now,
it didn't cost her anything.

38:07.550 --> 38:08.809
You better watch yourself.

38:08.810 --> 38:09.810
What the hell
are you doing?

38:09.811 --> 38:12.880
It cost her
her relationship with me!

38:18.120 --> 38:21.820
You didn't know about that,
did you?

38:21.830 --> 38:24.160
Well, now you do.

38:32.070 --> 38:35.169
So you'll destroy that
if I give you mine?

38:35.170 --> 38:38.600
I'm an attorney.
I can't destroy evidence.

38:38.610 --> 38:42.680
But you?
You can do whatever you want.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.140
You trust me to do that?

38:47.250 --> 38:50.010
No, Mike.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.920
Jessica does.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.669
Louis, I need you
to sit down.

39:08.670 --> 39:10.230
What is it?
What happened?

39:10.240 --> 39:11.839
Is your father okay?
I'll go down there right now.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.270
He's fine.
Harvey took care of it.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.849
Oh, well, then I don't need
to sit down.

39:14.850 --> 39:18.119
'Cause whatever it is,
if you're okay, I'll be okay.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.219
Sheila came forward.

39:20.220 --> 39:22.089
What?

39:22.090 --> 39:25.160
She admitted she was
the one to write the email.

39:27.230 --> 39:28.529
That's not possible.

39:28.530 --> 39:29.900
She promised me
she wouldn't do that.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.420
I'm sorry, Louis,
but she did.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.499
I need to be alone.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.300
Louis, I don't think
this is the time for you to--

39:41.310 --> 39:43.110
I said get out.

39:53.650 --> 39:54.640
He did it?

39:54.650 --> 39:55.710
He did.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.259
What did you say to him?

39:57.260 --> 39:59.919
I told him
how much it cost you,

39:59.920 --> 40:01.720
and then I did
what we talked about.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.999
Well, it's a good thing
you did,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
because those subpoenas
just came down.

40:11.470 --> 40:12.839
Jessica, I don't know
that I've ever been

40:12.840 --> 40:15.809
much of a spiritual person,

40:15.810 --> 40:17.839
but I would be lying
if I didn't admit

40:17.840 --> 40:20.900
that sometimes I think
God has a plan.

40:20.910 --> 40:22.309
What are you saying?

40:22.310 --> 40:24.270
I'm saying that maybe
he's trying to show you

40:24.280 --> 40:29.680
that there's more to life
than Pearson Specter Litt.

40:29.690 --> 40:31.459
I'm not gonna be
your attorney on this one.

40:31.460 --> 40:34.359
I think you can find
someone better.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.989
No.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.390
I trust you,
and there's no way

40:38.400 --> 40:40.729
I find someone
that I trust more.

40:40.730 --> 40:44.060
Then find me when
this is all over,

40:44.070 --> 40:47.310
and we'll see if we can put
that trust to better use.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.600
Gretchen, whatever it is,
it can wait till tomorrow.

40:54.610 --> 40:56.940
This can't wait.

40:56.950 --> 41:00.519
I want to apologize to you.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.119
For what?

41:02.120 --> 41:05.519
When Jack Soloff nominated
Mike Ross for partner,

41:05.520 --> 41:07.620
I know it hurt Harvey
a little,

41:07.630 --> 41:10.559
because he wanted to be
the one to do it,

41:10.560 --> 41:14.590
so I called the "ABA Journal"
to write an article about Mike.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.340
I wanted to surprise Harvey
with it.

41:20.040 --> 41:24.740
You're saying the article
that tipped Sheila off was you?

41:25.940 --> 41:28.470
Yes.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.279
Why are you
telling me this?

41:30.280 --> 41:34.310
Because I'm sorry.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.089
And if anyone ever asks,
I'll deny ever saying this,

41:37.090 --> 41:40.760
but...I know
you all knew.

41:43.190 --> 41:44.920
And I'm with you.

41:49.570 --> 41:51.640
Hey.
Hey.

41:54.510 --> 41:55.909
What's the matter?

41:55.910 --> 41:59.209
I know I said I don't want you
to keep things from me,

41:59.210 --> 42:00.679
but I don't want to keep things
from you either.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.149
What are you
keeping from me?

42:02.150 --> 42:04.819
It's actually
good and bad news.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.190
We had a chance to get this
whole case thrown out today,

42:07.191 --> 42:11.010
and it didn't work,
but we did get Donna off,

42:11.020 --> 42:14.350
and for the first time,
I actually started to believe

42:14.360 --> 42:16.629
we can get out of this thing.

42:16.630 --> 42:19.029
And why were you afraid
to admit that to me?

42:19.030 --> 42:23.029
Because I didn't want to
get your hopes up.

42:23.030 --> 42:25.230
And I didn't really
believe it before.

42:30.140 --> 42:31.170
Yeah, what's up?

42:31.180 --> 42:32.909
Sheila Sazs came forward,

42:32.910 --> 42:34.349
which means they're gonna
try and pit us all

42:34.350 --> 42:37.420
against each other
even more.
