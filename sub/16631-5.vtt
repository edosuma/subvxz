WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:06.866
- Look at this!

00:06.910 --> 00:08.434
- Archie, don't. Leave it!

00:08.480 --> 00:09.959
- I have 2 sons overseas.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.308
They're alive?
- Yeah.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.658
- Girls these days
haven't figured

00:14.710 --> 00:16.837
that beauty is in
what a woman hides.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.485
- Witham Foods has unparalleled
food-supply contacts.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.623
- Together,
we'll make millions.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.013
- Last night was
the best of my life.

00:25.060 --> 00:27.881
Marry me. The one I can cling
to when I'm over there.

00:27.940 --> 00:31.580
- Without a uniform, they don't
see a man, they see a coward.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.938
- An affair with Hazel
proves that you're not?

00:33.990 --> 00:37.244
What would you do if I strayed?
- Don't make me answer that.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.115
- I thought Lewis had
forgotten all about me,

00:42.170 --> 00:43.558
and look at this!

00:43.600 --> 00:45.204
Thirteen letters,
a baker's dozen!

00:45.260 --> 00:46.989
- Well, when a
soldier's mail comes,

00:47.040 --> 00:47.995
it comes in spurts.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.644
- Betty!

00:49.700 --> 00:51.782
- The censors are
so heavy-handed.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.788
- I thought you were
engaged to a rich American?

00:54.830 --> 00:56.821
- Well, now she's
engaged twice.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.484
- Is he romancing you?

00:58.530 --> 01:00.521
- Truth be told, it's
mostly about food.

01:00.580 --> 01:03.003
"There's not much beef
to be had in the market,

01:03.060 --> 01:04.482
"and eggs are
a dollar a dozen."

01:04.540 --> 01:06.440
- Boy, the guy oozes charm!

01:06.500 --> 01:09.230
- How can I write him back
if I wanna stay true to James?

01:09.280 --> 01:12.670
- Should've thought of that
before you gave him my address.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.676
- I dream of holding you
in my arms,

01:14.720 --> 01:16.893
to once again kiss your--

01:18.160 --> 01:19.593
Oh my!

01:19.640 --> 01:23.167
Soldiers don't write me
letters like that.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.427
[Clearing throat]

01:24.470 --> 01:26.256
- Mm-hmm.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.128
- It's your day off.
Have fun.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.513
- You can't be here.
I have neighbours, thin walls.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.470
- What will they say
about a poor paisano

01:34.520 --> 01:36.954
who brought fresh pomodoros
from his victory garden?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.651
- My husband could come home
from the legion any minute.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.395
- We'll make him
eggplant parmigiana.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.782
- We won't make
him anything.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.183
- You gotta take these.
They're from my best batch.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.188
- Marco, what happened the other
night, that was a mistake.

01:48.230 --> 01:49.538
I'm married.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.719
- If I thought I was
hurting anybody,

01:51.760 --> 01:53.011
I wouldn't be here.

01:55.020 --> 01:57.488
- Oh, you don't
make this easy.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.064
- Then I'm doing it right.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.987
[Moans]

02:05.340 --> 02:07.240
- [Whispering]: OK...

02:07.300 --> 02:08.904
[Knocking]

02:08.950 --> 02:10.679
Oh God!

02:10.730 --> 02:12.163
Stay here.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.391
Thank you
for the delivery.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.234
A military telegram.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.229
- Hey, don't
worry about it.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.158
There's plenty of reasons
for them to send a cable.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.895
- Yeah, it must
be about my boys.

02:42.940 --> 02:45.022
- Well, here.

02:45.070 --> 02:46.378
- No.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.763
I have to wait for Bob.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.720
This is for him and me.

02:54.650 --> 02:56.686
You need to go.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.698
- Well, you shouldn't
be alone, Lorna.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.389
- Please, Marco.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.692
This has nothing
to do with you.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.739
Please.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.675
[Breathing unevenly]

03:33.030 --> 03:35.294
- This family understands
soldiers, Major,

03:35.340 --> 03:38.901
Unlike another grocery firm,
which shall go unmentioned.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.508
- I'll mention it:
Steinham's!

03:40.560 --> 03:42.994
- Fighting in the Great War,
I learned firsthand...

03:43.040 --> 03:45.349
- Game face, Gladys!
The Army just sprung the news

03:45.390 --> 03:48.268
they're awarding the rations
contract in 48 hours.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.914
It's down to us
and the Steinhams.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.359
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.788
- Those are the rations

03:52.840 --> 03:55.001
James and Daddy
manufactured?

03:55.060 --> 03:56.266
-Indeed.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.924
- Swanlq.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.359
- Your father thinks the
product speaks for itself.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.362
- Give them a big
smile, Mrs. Witham.

04:05.410 --> 04:08.459
- I'd show them some leg
if I thought it would help.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.287
- Your father's playing up
his time in the Great War,

04:11.330 --> 04:12.729
for all it's worth.

04:12.770 --> 04:15.944
- I think he had a cushy
time of it, to tell the truth.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.720
- According to him, he defeated
the Huns single-handed.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.202
The nabobs are
lapping it up.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.205
- So he's paving
his way with lies?

04:22.260 --> 04:24.125
- Gladys, we need this win.

04:24.170 --> 04:26.081
This contract will
set us up for life.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.257
- Come, James.
The Colonel seems to think

04:28.310 --> 04:29.868
you're the brains
of the outfit.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.399
- Oh, he is, Father.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.919
- You too, Gladdy.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.224
I told him about
your war effort as well,

04:35.270 --> 04:37.875
even if it's only sorting
files in a munitions factory.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.093
- Only?
- Ah!

04:40.140 --> 04:42.142
Now, there's
the fire we need.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.361
[Both chuckling]

04:52.720 --> 04:54.244
- Ah!

04:54.290 --> 04:55.450
- Gin.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.206
I'll take those.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.377
- No need for coppers
where I'm going.

05:01.430 --> 05:05.207
- You're getting out of
here in a couple days.

05:05.260 --> 05:08.479
- I'm not gonna live
like this, Archie,

05:08.520 --> 05:11.080
not out there in
the big, bad world.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.784
Fancy a kiss?

05:19.230 --> 05:21.039
[Grunts]

05:21.100 --> 05:22.749
- Maybe I do.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.791
[Both chuckling]

05:24.840 --> 05:27.308
- With my luck, the scar
would travel to my eye.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.719
Tonight's pills make 39.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.580
Tomorrow's 40.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.972
Forty winks to follow.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.981
Forty winks forever.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.648
[Gladys chuckling]

05:51.690 --> 05:54.773
- What do you wanna do about
our 2-year anniversary?

05:54.830 --> 05:56.434
- Surprise me.
You always do.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.391
[Chuckling]

05:58.440 --> 06:00.829
- [Adele]: Just drop
that mess in the kitchen.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.177
We'll deal with it later.

06:15.110 --> 06:17.066
- Nearly caught
by the help.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.896
- These aren't
the rations we ate.

06:18.940 --> 06:19.975
They've gone off.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.895
- That's why we
couldn't serve them.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.283
There's still a few kinks
we have to iron out

06:24.340 --> 06:26.023
before we go into
full production.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.243
- You're conning the army
with tricked-out fakes?

06:29.300 --> 06:32.201
- They're enjoying French pt
mixed with boiled brisket.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.034
They're just rations.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.083
Who knows if the soldiers will
even need to eat this stuff?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.122
- James, I know that soldiers
are obsessed with food.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.434
Most times, a decent meal's the
only pleasure they see in a day.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.788
They're out there living
off a dog's breakfast,

06:45.840 --> 06:47.785
what kind of army
are we gonna have?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.445
- What kind of business
am I gonna have

06:50.490 --> 06:52.572
if we can't_
make a profit?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.974
- Oh yeah? Go on, then.
Eat it yourself.

06:57.020 --> 07:01.229
- We'll fix the rations once we
get Into production, I promise.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.709
[Door closing]

07:05.770 --> 07:09.467
- Bob, you back?

07:09.510 --> 07:13.685
Oh, damn it!
Where are you?

07:20.260 --> 07:21.386
[Sighing]

07:21.440 --> 07:23.385
[Clock ticking]

07:31.360 --> 07:34.830
You reek of drink.
You know that?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.053
This telegram
came last night.

07:37.100 --> 07:40.536
And where were you? Out getting
drunk with your buddies!

07:40.590 --> 07:42.012
- Is it the boys?

07:42.070 --> 07:44.277
- I don't know.
It won't be good, will it?

07:44.330 --> 07:47.549
Nobody ever delivers
good news in a telegram.

07:47.590 --> 07:50.889
I fell asleep waiting!

07:52.380 --> 07:54.336
I couldn't open it without you.

08:02.170 --> 08:03.694
- You gotta be kidding me.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.560
- What is it?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.828
- They're handing out
the tin already.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.259
Military Medal.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.279
- "For courage and utter
disregard for personal safety...

08:21.020 --> 08:22.840
Stanley risked his life?

08:22.890 --> 08:26.360
Saved someone else's?

08:26.410 --> 08:27.365
He's OK.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.490
[Sighing]

08:28.550 --> 08:30.154
He must be in...
North Africa.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.588
- Barely into this mess

08:31.640 --> 08:34.632
and already they're giving out
medals like gumdrops.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.988
- Stanley's a hero!

08:36.030 --> 08:37.247
[Laughing]

08:37.290 --> 08:38.507
Stanley!

08:38.560 --> 08:40.334
- It's a game, Lorna!

08:40.380 --> 08:44.259
It's like kids
swapping baseball cards.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.428
- Is your heart so dead,
you can't even take a moment

08:50.480 --> 08:53.608
to feel proud of the man
our son's become?

08:53.660 --> 08:55.002
- I'm relieved as hell,

08:55.050 --> 08:56.870
but it doesn't
make me blind

08:56.920 --> 09:00.356
to the war machine buying off
our boys with bits of brass.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.623
Since when do you get
dressed up for work?

09:08.930 --> 09:11.933
- Just showing a
little pride, Bob.

09:14.850 --> 09:17.239
- Leon!

09:17.290 --> 09:20.726
Your singing at the
canteen dance was amazing.

09:20.770 --> 09:23.421
- Ah, that's good
of you to say.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.074
- I wish I could
sing like that.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.815
- That would be
a novelty act,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.735
you looking
the way you do,

09:28.780 --> 09:30.475
sounding the way I do.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.169
- I wonder...

09:32.220 --> 09:36.338
Do you think I might ever be
good enough to sing with a band?

09:36.400 --> 09:39.619
- Mm-hmm, yeah. Let me
know when you find one.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.529
- [Woman]:
Oh, wait up, girls!

09:42.580 --> 09:43.797
[Buzzer sounding]

09:45.060 --> 09:46.402
- Hey, Kate!

09:46.450 --> 09:47.405
Hey.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.530
- Hi.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.529
- Lorna.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.546
Lorna, the telegram?
I'm worried.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.626
- It was good news.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.410
My boy, Stanley, got the
Military Medal for bravery.

09:59.460 --> 10:02.338
- Oh! Then you must be
relieved and proud.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.893
- I am. Very.

10:03.950 --> 10:06.111
- Maybe I was your
good-luck charm.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.817
[Sighing]

10:11.610 --> 10:13.475
- Be careful,
Mr. Moretti.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.862
- I always am.

10:14.910 --> 10:15.990
[Clears throat]

10:23.310 --> 10:25.221
- Letters mean
so much to soldiers.

10:25.270 --> 10:26.874
Even when they
don't know a girl,

10:26.930 --> 10:29.398
they like knowing
someone's thinking of them.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.008
- But I do know
this soldier.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.664
It makes writing
to him worse

10:32.710 --> 10:34.587
because I'd be
lying to 2 people.

10:34.630 --> 10:37.884
- You can't break his heart
before he goes into battle.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.192
- It does seem a
wretched thing to do.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.242
- Stop by tonight,
I'll show you letters

10:42.290 --> 10:44.633
the girls at the
rooming house write the boys.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.591
- That would be swell.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.246
I'll even nick a few bottles
of bubbly for your trouble.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.688
- Champagne?

10:51.730 --> 10:53.288
- Yeah.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.557
- Oh!

10:54.610 --> 10:56.293
[Both chuckling]

10:57.910 --> 10:59.434
- Another one pregnant.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.914
- Well, happy news
for the husband.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.746
- Her husband shipped out
a year ago.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.746
[Scoffing]

11:05.790 --> 11:08.520
- I--I don't know where
your girls find all these men!

11:08.580 --> 11:11.265
I sure would like a few
of 'em around here, though.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.187
- Perhaps love would be
a better recruitment tool.

11:14.230 --> 11:17.358
- What about you,
Mrs. Corbett?

11:17.410 --> 11:18.627
-Hmm?

11:18.670 --> 11:21.673
- How's your
heart these days?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.108
- Strong and able.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.890
- Not bursting with emotion?

11:25.940 --> 11:29.330
- I don't_ know what
you're insmuating.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.723
- Well, your son.
He's one of our first boys

11:31.770 --> 11:33.818
to receive
the Military Medal.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.681
- Ah, yes.
We're very proud.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.164
- Which makes you
the perfect speaker

11:39.220 --> 11:41.518
for the factory's
Armistice Day service.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.731
11:00 a.m.
on the 11th.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.475
The boss has approved
a work stoppage.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.612
- I'm hardly the type
to gives speeches, sir.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.708
- You're exactly
the kind of woman

11:50.750 --> 11:52.615
our workers need
to hear from.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.220
Oh, and families welcome.

11:55.270 --> 11:57.226
We're clearing the line

12:04.720 --> 12:06.199
[Bird chirping]

12:06.240 --> 12:07.548
[Knocking]

12:07.590 --> 12:10.058
- It's me.
- Come in!

12:10.120 --> 12:12.987
- Your mother said
I could come up.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.679
Our business won't take long.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.288
Sure you don't
wanna go out later?

12:16.340 --> 12:17.375
- Sorry, girl's night.

12:17.430 --> 12:18.727
- Are we still quarrelling?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.419
- That depends.
Are the rations still vile?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.472
- Well, "vile" is
a little strong.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.738
- So was the smell.

12:27.740 --> 12:31.437
- I spoke to a manager
at Tank's plant.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.483
He says the canning sealant
has a 3% spoilage rate.

12:34.530 --> 12:35.747
- And?

12:35.790 --> 12:37.963
- And increasing the
thickness of the seal

12:38.010 --> 12:40.092
would reduce the
risk substantially.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.186
- It's simple.
Increase the seal.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.358
- Except the process
is more costly.

12:45.410 --> 12:48.140
- But you know it's
the right thing to do.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.418
James, if you win
this contract--

12:50.460 --> 12:53.588
- There's no "if".
I'm here to sign it.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.803
Withams is now the
official supplier

12:56.860 --> 12:59.761
of quality rations
to our men overseas.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.816
- I want to congratulate you,

13:02.860 --> 13:05.511
but if those rations
aren't improved...

13:05.560 --> 13:07.516
- We won't poison
our troops, Gladys.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.609
As you say, they do
so much for us.

13:10.650 --> 13:11.821
[Chuckles]

13:16.360 --> 13:20.524
- We are all asked
to make sacrifices

13:20.580 --> 13:23.447
and while not every
sacrifice is rewarded--

13:23.490 --> 13:25.185
[Whispering]:
No, that's not it.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.801
It is our duty to do so...

13:30.850 --> 13:32.624
[Sighing]

13:32.680 --> 13:35.717
- I'll tell you how
Armistice Day should be marked.

13:35.770 --> 13:39.240
We should drag out the bodies
of about 200 teenage boys,

13:39.290 --> 13:40.939
scatter them
in the streets...

13:40.990 --> 13:42.469
- That's obscene!

13:42.510 --> 13:44.330
- ...and let the rats
have a go at them.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.519
That would be something
worth remembering.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.209
- It's been 25 years, Bob,

13:48.260 --> 13:50.865
25 years since you went
over that goddamned trench!

13:50.910 --> 13:53.378
We have raised 3 children,
buried our parents,

13:53.440 --> 13:55.567
and somehow managed to
keep food on the table

13:55.610 --> 13:56.918
and a roof over our heads!

13:56.960 --> 13:59.428
But it's like none of
that ever happened,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.833
because you see
everything through the lens

14:01.880 --> 14:04.269
of a few terrible months
you had 25 years ago!

14:04.320 --> 14:06.538
- You've no idea what
that war was like.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.400
- Because you never tell me!

14:08.450 --> 14:10.008
I asked, I hinted, I tried,

14:10.060 --> 14:11.755
and then finally,
I gave up.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.496
- You want me to drag you
into a muddy gash of earth,

14:14.540 --> 14:16.451
tell you how everything
bled out of me

14:16.500 --> 14:19.105
the day I did my duty
and jumped over that trench?

14:19.160 --> 14:21.628
Well, I won't do it!
No decent man would!

14:21.680 --> 14:24.114
- I think a decent father--
- Don't you start!

14:24.160 --> 14:27.459
- A decent father would
let go of his own pain

14:27.510 --> 14:31.037
when he's learned what a brave
and honourable son he raised.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.501
- Mmm! This soda
isn't half bad.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.940
- Careful, Bets. Champagne
has a terrible reputation

15:07.990 --> 15:10.550
for giving girls
terrible reputations.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.648
- Not to mention
terrible handwriting.

15:12.690 --> 15:15.682
I can barely read what I've
written these last 2 soldiers.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.129
Gladys, read us
what you've got.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.912
-Mmm!

15:20.960 --> 15:23.781
- "Dear Lewis, how lovely
to receive your letters.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.560
"Each time I read one
I feel closer to you--"

15:26.620 --> 15:28.485
- Though not as
close as we got

15:28.530 --> 15:30.964
when you mauled me
against a brick wall and--

15:31.010 --> 15:31.965
- Betty!

15:32.010 --> 15:32.965
[Giggling]

15:33.010 --> 15:34.272
- "...closer to you,

15:34.320 --> 15:36.220
"and proud of the sacrifice
you're making

15:36.280 --> 15:38.236
"for the safety
of our nation."

15:38.280 --> 15:41.499
- So poetic! You'll stoke
his heart, Gladys.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.498
- Especially if his heart slid
a little lower than it once was.

15:44.550 --> 15:47.064
- Oh! I think I'm walking
the line impeccably,

15:47.120 --> 15:49.327
cheering him up
without leading him on.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.678
- You should send him
some photos!

15:51.730 --> 15:53.425
- Now that would
give him false hope.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.938
- Oh! Give him a
kick where it counts!

15:55.990 --> 15:57.548
- You want a kick?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.511
Let's go see Leon
and his band play.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.028
- You know where Leon plays?

16:02.090 --> 16:03.512
- I got a rough idea, yeah.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.861
- Isn't it a bit late?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.309
- No one said
you had to come.

- James! Are_ we businessmen
or charity canners?

16:42.820 --> 16:46.472
- I'm all for healthy profits,
but it'll cost less to fix now

16:46.520 --> 16:48.340
than if we're forced
to do it later.

16:48.390 --> 16:49.789
James, you were
the one that

16:49.830 --> 16:51.786
had a problem with
the spoilage issue.

16:51.830 --> 16:54.139
- 97% of this product
is flawless.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.307
Good enough for any man,
especially a soldier.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.658

don't be a soldier.

38:51.020 --> 38:53.238
You had a full-fledged
sexual affair!

38:53.280 --> 38:55.009
- It's not the same thing!
- Why not?

38:55.070 --> 38:56.628
- Because I didn't
care about her.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.977
She meant
nothing to me.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.544
- Except you showed her
more of yourself

39:00.590 --> 39:01.932
than I have
ever seen.

39:03.990 --> 39:05.469
What are you
afraid of, James?

39:05.510 --> 39:06.727
- That this is me.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.943
That this is
all there is.

39:10.870 --> 39:14.169
- That's all
I've ever wanted.

39:16.090 --> 39:19.651
- If I did this all wrong,
I'm so sorry. I didn't--

39:19.700 --> 39:21.952
I'm so sorry.

39:24.490 --> 39:26.173
- Make it up to me.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.747
- Are you sure?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.358
- Yes.

39:40.370 --> 39:41.632
I love you.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.238
- I love you too.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.684
- James?

39:53.730 --> 39:55.903
- I told you I learned
a thing or two.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.558
- Was it worth
the wait?

40:02.610 --> 40:06.080
- Only if we make up
for lost time.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.437
[Giggles]

40:09.050 --> 40:11.871
- Your letter to that airman--
What was his name?

40:11.930 --> 40:14.444
- Lewis.

40:14.490 --> 40:15.798
- You can't send it.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.229
- I have to tell
him the truth.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.145
He needs to
know it's over.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.454
- Right now, he thinks he's
taking you into battle with him.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.809
We'll break his heart
when the war is over.

40:25.850 --> 40:28.375
- I'm sure he'll have
forgotten me by then.

40:28.420 --> 40:31.469
- I don't think
that's possible.

40:34.340 --> 40:36.683
- You're top drawer,
James Dunn.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.394
- You here to
see Vera?

40:54.450 --> 40:55.963
- Yes.

40:56.010 --> 40:57.966
I heard about
yourfnend.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.920
I'm so sorry.

41:03.850 --> 41:05.886
- There's people.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.192
- I'm merely
comforting a co-worker.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.458
Nothing more,
nothing less.

41:12.810 --> 41:14.983
- Yeah.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.729
- Were you close?

41:17.770 --> 41:19.374
- Not really,
but somehow,

41:19.430 --> 41:22.160
I'm the one they asked
to fetch his things.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.030
- What about
Archie's family?

41:25.830 --> 41:28.651
- He was alone, Lorna.
No family, no friends.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.691
That's how it
is in the end.

41:30.740 --> 41:33.789
- Well, we're lucky
we have our families.

41:33.830 --> 41:36.264
- Yeah. I saw your
husband yesterday.

41:36.310 --> 41:38.050
- Yes, you did.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.409
- Not what I was expecting.
- Bob's a good man.

41:40.450 --> 41:42.532
- Because he wheeled out
for one speech?

41:42.580 --> 41:44.445
- How dare you?

41:44.500 --> 41:46.661
- You're not happy
with him, Lorna.

41:46.720 --> 41:50.235
- I know what it cost him
to do that, to be there.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.064
You don't.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.546
- There isn't gonna be
a safe place for us, is there?

41:57.380 --> 41:59.336
- I wish there were.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.632
- It's so brief,
you know, Lorna,

42:03.210 --> 42:05.553
If you're gonna burn,
why not burn bright?

42:11.180 --> 42:15.822
- I rang Cook, requested
something special for lunch.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.838
- Not yet married and
already acting the hostess.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.576
- It seemed appropriate
to mark Armistice Day

42:21.620 --> 42:24.316
with an act of solidarity
with our soldiers.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.974
A day late,

42:28.020 --> 42:30.750
but not a dollar short,
not even a dime.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.586
- You think this is funny?

42:32.630 --> 42:34.018
- Of course,
if this comes

42:34.070 --> 42:36.584
from one of the 3% cans
that may be sp0iled,

42:36.640 --> 42:37.891
what do you think?

42:37.940 --> 42:39.669
10 minutes from
here to the hospital?

42:39.730 --> 42:40.936
- Sounds
about right.

42:40.990 --> 42:43.424
- Get this out
of my face.

42:43.470 --> 42:45.552
- Oh, all the more for me.

42:49.260 --> 42:52.036
Mmm! Ptomaine poison!
- Gladys!

42:52.090 --> 42:55.696
- You've no clue the compromises
that come with doing business.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.526
- I know all about
compromise, Father,

42:57.570 --> 43:00.004
doing the right thing for
as many people as possible.

43:00.050 --> 43:02.575
- If we increase the density
of the interior lacquer,

43:02.620 --> 43:04.611
the spoilage rate
decreases to almost nil,

43:04.660 --> 43:06.616
production costs
go up 2%.

43:06.670 --> 43:09.400
- Next thing you know, we'll
be doing this for nothing.

43:09.450 --> 43:11.315
- I have as much say
in this as you do.

43:11.370 --> 43:12.792
- Well...

43:13.850 --> 43:15.533
I've lost my appetite.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.631
- Where'd you dream up
this little antic?

43:21.680 --> 43:24.205
Last night's sleepover
with Carol?

43:24.250 --> 43:26.150
- Turns out I didn't
get much sleep.

43:26.210 --> 43:28.906
Oh my my

43:28.950 --> 43:30.986
Oh my my

43:31.040 --> 43:33.292
- You are lovesick
There ain't no cure

43:33.340 --> 43:34.898
- Oh my my...

43:34.960 --> 43:37.474
- I fear the devil's
knocking at your door

43:37.520 --> 43:39.306
[Chuckling]

43:39.350 --> 43:41.215
But it won't do
- Oh my my

43:41.270 --> 43:43.613
- 'Cause all I want
- Oh my my

43:43.660 --> 43:46.049
- All I need
- Oh my my

43:46.100 --> 43:48.398
- Is, darling, you
- Oh my my

43:48.450 --> 43:51.578
- Isaid please
don't let me go

43:51.620 --> 43:53.349
- Please don't let me go

43:53.410 --> 43:55.184
- I said

43:55.240 --> 43:57.583
- [Both]:
Please don't let me go

43:57.630 --> 44:01.669
- Isaid please
don't let me go

44:01.720 --> 44:06.726
I said please
don't let me go
