01:05.265 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:28.555 --> 01:32.389
Animation is so great.
It's way better than...

01:32.492 --> 01:34.392
whatever the alternative is.

01:34.494 --> 01:39.090
Seems like animated shows
are everywhere- or were, last year.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.963
Cool! Japanimation.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.875
Electro-web, deploy!

01:53.980 --> 01:57.006
Now I control the Roboverse!

01:58.184 --> 02:00.652
Your laugh is incorrect, Meganaut!

02:00.753 --> 02:03.654
Activate Prawn Power!

02:19.772 --> 02:23.538
Man, that Princess Tempura's
one heck of a Transformazoid.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.636
Wait. I'm confused. Why was
a wolf shooting a web?

02:27.747 --> 02:29.681
Cartoons don't have to make sense.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.773
He's right, you know.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.877
Daddy, are you sure it's okay
for us to watch cartoons?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.252
Mm-hmm. This one's
fine and dandy, Roddy.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.848
It's approved by a council
of Presby-Lutheran ministers.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.562
What you making there, Gravey?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.964
It's a pipe bomb, Jobriath...

02:49.068 --> 02:51.195
for to blow up Planned Parenthood.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.966
I don't know, Gravey.

02:54.073 --> 02:57.372
I'm sick of your lack of faith.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.445
Hmm?

02:59.546 --> 03:00.513
But, Gravey-

03:00.613 --> 03:02.410
Yea!

03:08.621 --> 03:11.590
And then I created the voice
of Yellow-bellied Yak.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.125
All I need is some courage.
Courage, I tell ya.

03:14.227 --> 03:17.390
Excuse me, but isn't that voice
very similar to the Cowardly Lion?

03:17.497 --> 03:21.866
Also, sir, your Loudmouth Leopard
is a rip-off ofJackie Gleason.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.434
Humina, humina,
humina, humina, humina.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.938
And Clutzy Cat sounds
exactly likeJerry Lewis...

03:28.041 --> 03:31.602
with the stealing and the lawsuit
and the " Oh, nice judge.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.077
Don't hurt a person with the thing."

03:48.228 --> 03:50.162
<i>And cut.</i>

03:50.263 --> 03:52.663
<i>After a tough day on the set...</i>

03:52.765 --> 03:55.359
<i>how do Itchy and Scratchy relax?</i>

03:55.468 --> 03:57.902
With Laramie Extra-Tar Cigarettes.

03:58.004 --> 04:01.098
- Here's your smokes, Mr. Itchy.
- Thank you, Louis.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.940
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.177
And now there's more nico-glycerol.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.813
I don't know what's in 'em.
I just know I can't stop smokin' 'em!

04:24.831 --> 04:28.323
Wait a minute. Was that cat
making out with that mouse?

04:28.434 --> 04:30.368
'Cause if they were-

04:33.106 --> 04:38.043
Folks, you're about to witness the exciting
new process of motion-capture animation.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.444
- Now, we'll need a vol-
- <i>Pick me! Pick me!</i>

04:44.517 --> 04:49.580
Now, when you move any part of your body,
our furry friend will copy you exactly.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.089
Hmm. Hmm!

04:52.191 --> 04:55.285
# I'm a little teapot, short and stout #

04:55.395 --> 04:58.796
<i># Here is my handle</i>
<i>Here is my spout ##</i>

05:03.670 --> 05:05.570
Uh, let me see.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.197
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.368
And that's the truth.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.782
That dog's a riot.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.283
Thank you.

05:19.385 --> 05:22.650
Don't spay or neuter
your pets. Good night!

05:26.526 --> 05:28.687
<i>Zipperoonie.</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:35.828
<i>Oh, yeah. Urinal cake eroding.</i>
<i>Eroding! Eroding!</i>

05:35.935 --> 05:38.062
<i>Gone!</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:46.505
That motion-capture suit
is just what this country needs.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.945
Just think of all the hilarious motions
that are going uncaptured.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.210
Like this.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.513
Hey.

05:54.620 --> 05:59.148
See? Now, wouldn't you love to see
that move performed by a cartoon possum?

05:59.258 --> 06:02.523
An opossum capering around
like that would be a smash hit.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.721
It would be the world's
funniest marsupial.

06:04.831 --> 06:08.494
Yeah, right. That suit gizmo
could be worth billions!

06:08.601 --> 06:10.569
And I'm gonna get
a piece of the action!

06:14.173 --> 06:17.802
So, does he still work here, or what?

06:19.545 --> 06:23.345
I'd like to withdraw my life savings,
please. And hurry!

06:23.449 --> 06:25.508
Uh, sir, this is a joint account.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.813
Uh, you'll need
your wife's signature too.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.354
Oh! Yes, of course.

06:30.456 --> 06:33.186
Yeah. Uh, she's behind that plant.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.025
Hello, Marge.
Hi, Homie.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.429
Sign this, please.
You're the boss.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.434
Daddy, ask the man for some candy.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.437
No, no.
No candy for you.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.303
Well, at least
get some candy for yourself.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.604
Kids.

06:51.711 --> 06:55.545
Here's your candy.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.809
- So long, sucker!
- Uh, sir.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.942
Your life savings.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.988
Uh, yes. I see that it's in bill form.
Excellent.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.453
I'd like to buy 500 shares
of Animotion, Incorporated.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.565
Okay.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.600
Uh, now, before
I execute this order...

07:15.701 --> 07:18.101
are you sure you understand
the risks of stock ownership?

07:18.204 --> 07:20.104
Absolutely.

07:20.206 --> 07:24.939
#We're in the money
We're in the money #

07:28.748 --> 07:30.875
You heard the monkey.
Make the trade.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.222
For automated stock prices,
please state the company name.

07:37.323 --> 07:41.020
- Animotion.
- Animotion, up one and one-half.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.654
- Yahoo!
- Yahoo, up six and a quarter.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.664
Huh? What is this crap?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.496
Fox Broadcasting, down eight.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.968
<i>Sleep tight, my beloved.</i>

07:52.071 --> 07:54.938
You're my ticket
out of this hellhole.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.941
- Homer!
- Sorry.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.443
<i>Our</i> ticket out of this hellhole.

08:02.515 --> 08:05.973
- Turning to the stock market,
Animotion is up an eighth-
- Yes!

08:06.085 --> 08:08.883
After plunging 75 points
this morning.

08:08.988 --> 08:13.516
Oh. I hope "plunging" means "up"
and "75" means "200."

08:13.626 --> 08:16.094
The firm declared
super-duper bankruptcy...

08:16.195 --> 08:18.663
which is terrible news for the company's
only stockholder, Homer Simpson.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.731
Oh!

08:25.938 --> 08:27.428
<i>Family meeting.</i>

08:27.540 --> 08:28.507
Family meeting.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.576
Okay, people. Let's keep this short.
We all want to get home to our families.

08:31.744 --> 08:35.441
All right. First item.
I lost our life savings in the stock market.

08:35.548 --> 08:39.917
Now let's move on to the real issue-
Lisa's hogging of the maple syrup.

08:40.019 --> 08:44.319
Well, maybe if Mom didn't make
such dry waffles. There, I said it.

08:44.423 --> 08:47.756
Well, maybe if you ate some meat,
you'd have a natural lubricant.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.055
You lost all our money?

08:50.162 --> 08:52.824
Point of order.
I didn't lose all the money.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.866
There was enough left
for this cowbell.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.571
Damn you, eBay!

09:05.945 --> 09:08.675
I have a great way
to solve our money woes.

09:08.781 --> 09:12.182
You rent your womb
to a rich childless couple.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.480
If you agree,
signify by getting indignant.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.454
Are you crazy?
I'm not gonna be a surrogate mother.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.492
Come on, Marge.
We're a team.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.892
It's "uter-us," not "uter-you."

09:23.996 --> 09:26.328
Forget it.

09:27.833 --> 09:31.462
You know, Homer,
I got a great way to make money.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.802
- I'm a human guinea pig.
- You mean like medical testing?

09:34.907 --> 09:37.899
Yeah. Medical, military,
chewin' stuff.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.910
- Chewin' stuff?
- Yeah.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.879
Like you chew on a telephone wire
till you get a shock.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.847
Oh. Oh, right. Okay.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.885
Yeah, but aren't those
experiments dangerous?

09:46.986 --> 09:49.011
Ah, you get a few side effects.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.579
- Are those ears?
- Ow! Not so loud!

09:52.692 --> 09:54.626
Hmm.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.162
First we'll test this
experimental perfume on you.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.997
It burns! It burns!

10:04.103 --> 10:06.469
Hmm. We'll call it Desert Breeze.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.472
Mm-hmm.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.438
That appetite
suppressant is amazing.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.914
Homer, you really have
no desire to eat that food?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.884
Food?
I'm blind!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.591
Who's gonna buy a pill
that makes you blind?

10:25.691 --> 10:28.182
We'll let marketing worry about that.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.127
D'oh.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.592
D'oh!

10:36.636 --> 10:38.763
D'oh!

10:38.871 --> 10:40.771
Where did that rat come from?

10:40.873 --> 10:43.671
- He must have brought it in with him.
- Hmm.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.869
Damn it!

10:45.978 --> 10:49.277
Man, is he dumb.
Where do they get these subjects?

10:49.382 --> 10:51.907
He's a little too well fed
to be a wino.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.509
- Hey. What's that?
- Zoom in on section eight.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.457
Rotate 20 degrees.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.531
Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you have
a crayon lodged in your brain.

11:12.638 --> 11:15.402
There's a crayon in my brain?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.034
But I've had thousands
of head X-rays.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.170
How come no one ever
noticed it before?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.180
Oh, I can answer that.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.479
You see, whenever I pick up an X-ray,
I always hold it like this.

11:26.585 --> 11:30.282
My thumb must have covered up
the crayon every time.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.552
I'll show myself out.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.684
Do you have any idea
how this might have happened?

11:35.795 --> 11:37.786
Well, I'm not sure...

11:37.897 --> 11:41.162
but it might have happened
when I was six.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.535
Fourteen.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.538
Fifteen.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.870
Sixteen!

11:50.976 --> 11:52.967
Whoo-hoo!

11:53.079 --> 11:55.809
Oh, I don't feel so good.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.516
Ah, I think that's all of them.

12:00.619 --> 12:04.783
Mr. Simpson, this could be responsible
for your subnormal intelligence.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.690
Hey, I came here to be drugged,
electrocuted and probed, not insulted.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.955
We could remove the crayon for you.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.726
It could vastly increase your brainpower-
or it could possibly kill you.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.793
Hmm. Increase my killing power, eh?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.872
Let's do it.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.639
Oh, Homer, where have you been?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.704
I just underwent a procedure
to increase my I. Q 50 points.

12:29.815 --> 12:34.548
- Really?
- And they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble too.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.587
Do you feel smarter?

12:36.689 --> 12:39.419
Is the capital
of North Dakota Bismarck?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.554
- It is.
- I don't believe it.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.631
- Say something else smart.
- Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well-known...

12:46.732 --> 12:49.792
but her psychological
credentials are highly suspect.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.336
It's true!

12:53.439 --> 12:56.499
Now, who's up for a trip
to the library tomorrow?

12:56.609 --> 13:00.477
Notice I no longer say
"libary" or "tomorry."

13:00.579 --> 13:04.379
- I'd love to go to the library with you.
- It's a date.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.849
Dad, did you read
all these books today?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.449
Everything from <i>Hop on Pop</i>
to <i>Death Be Not Proud.</i>

13:15.561 --> 13:18.462
It's so tragic
the way they hopped on Pop.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.965
- I always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
- Get out.

13:22.067 --> 13:26.231
No, really. I think books have an amazing power
to bring people together. Look.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.034
<i>Even Cletus is checking one out.</i>

13:29.141 --> 13:31.302
Now hold still.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.538
Nothing cracks a turtle
like Leon Uris.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.881
Ow! Dang it! Ow!

13:37.983 --> 13:41.976
That sonata may not be
a Glenn Gould performance...

13:42.087 --> 13:44.749
but I must say it's "good as Gould."

13:48.761 --> 13:50.661
Hey, Flanders.
Heading for church?

13:50.763 --> 13:52.754
Well, I thought I could
save you a little time.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.730
Ooh! Found a new shortcut.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.667
Better. I was working
on a flat tax proposal...

13:57.770 --> 14:00.933
and I accidentally proved
there's no God.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.600
We'll just see about tha-

14:03.709 --> 14:06.701
Uh-oh. Well,
maybe he made a mista-

14:06.812 --> 14:09.076
No. It's airtight.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.649
Can't let this little doozy get out.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.326
Welcome to the third lecture
in our series...

14:21.427 --> 14:23.622
on not putting things up your nose.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.857
Please welcome Homer Simpson.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.263
I am here to give hope
to the least of you...

14:30.369 --> 14:33.099
because we all have
a crayon up our nose.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.400
Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.101
Maybe it's a crayon
made of prejudice.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.110
- Question.
- Yes, Nelson.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.113
- A moron says what?
- Not being a moron, I wouldn't know.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.115
However-

14:45.217 --> 14:49.711
- What?
- Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your moron.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.847
Ha-ha!

14:51.957 --> 14:54.391
You see?
It's cool to be smart.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.592
So be like me and use your minds.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.723
Paint a painting,
sing a song and dance a dance.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.767
Thank you.
Unfortunately, due to budget cuts...

15:06.872 --> 15:09.102
we are canceling
art, music and dance.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.541
Please evacuate the auditorium
before it's bulldozed into a mini-mall.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.886
So, is that your usual coffee mug?

15:21.987 --> 15:24.455
- Yep.
- Hmm. Looks a little bigger.

15:24.556 --> 15:27.218
It's not.

15:28.961 --> 15:33.728
- What you mailing, Homer?
- I've compiled a thorough
safety report on this plant.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.697
How come you're not
giving it to Mr. Burns?

15:35.801 --> 15:38.599
I've decided to disintermediate
the local authorities...

15:38.704 --> 15:41.571
and send it straight
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.574
Yeah. And just in time.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.043
Every day there's
more skin on my pillow.

15:47.146 --> 15:50.638
Yeah, it's nice to have someone
with brains in this nuclear plant.

15:50.749 --> 15:54.116
Homer's the guy who rigged up my pants
with this special codpiece.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.244
- Comfy, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.552
It provides the freedom
and protection I so sorely need.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.125
Yeah!

16:07.566 --> 16:10.763
It seems the <i>federales</i> have been tipped off
by an anonymous whistle-blower.

16:10.869 --> 16:11.836
Mm-hmm.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.178
Now, while the plant
is brought up to code...

16:20.279 --> 16:22.247
there will be massive layoffs.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.316
That is to say, total layoffs.
Toodles!

16:26.685 --> 16:30.018
Hmm. Way to put us
out of work, genius.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.852
I can't feed my family
with a codpiece.

16:34.460 --> 16:38.487
Wait. You can't hate me.
I'm your better!

16:38.597 --> 16:40.565
Your better!

16:40.666 --> 16:44.762
Oh, you've really done it this time, dum-dum.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.842
<i>Burn, burn, burn!</i>
<i>Burn, burn, burn!</i>

16:52.945 --> 16:56.312
Effigy, eh?
Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.245
Hey! That's me!

16:59.351 --> 17:03.310
Stop that.
The fire inspector would be appalled.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.856
Don't tell me how to feel.

17:07.092 --> 17:10.492
- So you all hate me?
- That's right, brainiac.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.895
You cost us our jobs,
which we need for working!

17:13.999 --> 17:15.967
Not to mention driving to.

17:16.068 --> 17:20.936
And I was a lot happier before I knew
Dame Edna was a man. A lot happier.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.031
You ain't welcome here
no more, smart boy.

17:24.143 --> 17:27.271
Hmm. I'm detecting
a distinct strain...

17:27.378 --> 17:29.939
of anti-intellectualism
in this tavern.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.916
Power off, Einstein.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.049
Lisa, why didn't you warn me?

17:37.156 --> 17:40.614
Being a brain has alienated me
from all my friends.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.526
Dad, as intelligence goes up,
happiness often goes down.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.325
In fact, I made a graph.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.957
I make a lot of graphs.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.093
Well, what gets you through the day?

17:51.203 --> 17:54.639
Oh, many things.
Tai chi, chai tea...

17:54.740 --> 17:58.267
but I find when I can't keep the unhappy
thoughts from swirling in my brain...

17:58.377 --> 18:00.777
the best thing is
usually a nice long walk.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.076
A walk? That's a really good idea.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.848
Hmm? Hmm.

18:15.961 --> 18:19.226
Do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

18:19.331 --> 18:20.855
I do.

18:20.966 --> 18:24.458
One groom- <i>Two</i> grooms?

18:24.570 --> 18:27.266
But he-
But you can't-

18:27.372 --> 18:30.773
Oh, my medication!

18:30.876 --> 18:34.243
- Radical!
- Is that your final answer?

18:37.015 --> 18:40.178
I don't understand.
That wasn't funny.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.810
Wait a minute. Somebody's
not laughing here.

18:42.921 --> 18:47.187
- It's him.
- Hey. Don't blame me. This movie
is tired and predictable.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.853
You know she's gonna wind up
marrying Richard Gere.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.454
I thought she'd wind up
with that rich snob.

18:53.565 --> 18:56.090
Ably played by Bill Paxton.

18:56.201 --> 18:59.534
It's Bill Pullman, you fool!

18:59.638 --> 19:03.574
Point out your plot holes elsewhere.

19:04.877 --> 19:09.678
Is there no place for the man
with the 105 I. Q?

19:25.664 --> 19:29.293
I'm a Spalding Gray
in a Rick Dees world.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.926
Change me back to
the blissful boob I was!

19:32.037 --> 19:34.005
I'm sorry.
We don't play God here.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.166
That's ridiculous.
You do nothing <i>but</i> play God.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.767
And I think your "octo-parrot"
would agree.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.369
Polly shouldn't be.

19:42.481 --> 19:46.042
Look. What if we gave you the name
of an unlicensed surgeon?

19:46.151 --> 19:48.176
Oh, that would be heaven.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.312
Say- Moe Szyslak?

19:50.422 --> 19:52.287
<i>That's right. I'm a surgeon.</i>

19:56.328 --> 20:01.391
So what do you want here?
Uh, appendectomy, lipo or the sampler?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.731
- That's very popular.
- I want you to stick this crayon...

20:04.836 --> 20:07.964
- into my brain.
- No problem.

20:08.073 --> 20:11.600
The old "Crayola oblongata."

20:16.782 --> 20:20.047
Ah. Now for a little powder blue.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.481
Oh, no. He wouldn't!

20:24.590 --> 20:27.855
All right. Tell me when
I hit the sweet spot.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.520
Deeper, you pusillanimous
pilsner pusher!

20:30.629 --> 20:32.654
All right. All right.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.664
Defense!

20:34.766 --> 20:36.233
Defense!

20:36.335 --> 20:39.736
Uh, that's pretty dumb,
but, uh-

20:39.838 --> 20:44.002
- Extended warranty? How can I lose?
- Perfect.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.339
Sweetheart, a missing crayon
could be anywhere.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.349
Who wants lottery tickets?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.817
Okay. It's in his brain.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.822
Dad, how could you?
We were connecting in such a meaningful way.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.825
We were what-what in the what-what?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.225
Yeah. Which reminds me,
I need a sandwich.

21:06.798 --> 21:10.666
- Hey. What's this?
- I don't know. Must be something
I wrote before Moe fixed me.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.699
"Lisa, I'm taking
the coward's way out.

21:15.807 --> 21:18.571
"But before I do,
I just want you to know...

21:18.677 --> 21:22.443
being smart made me appreciate
how amazing you really are."

21:22.547 --> 21:23.514
Oh, Dad.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.889
Oh, you want a hug.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.958
Well, that I know how to do.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.027
Mmm.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.926
Mmm. Hug.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.377
Shh!
