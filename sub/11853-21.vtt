{\an3}Hi there.

{\an3}(Croaking)

01:38.932 --> 01:41.835
Look, a frog.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.604
{\an1}(Barking)

01:46.239 --> 01:47.874
GIL:
Where did he go?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.677
Gil, check it out.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.146
{\an8}Those are baby frogs.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.715
Frogs?
But they have tails.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
{\an3}Yeah.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.818
When frogs are babies,
they have tails.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.621
They're called
tadpoles.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.989
Whoa.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.158
{\an8}And when they get bigger,

02:05.225 --> 02:07.927
{\an8}they lose their tails
and they grow legs.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.163
Cool.
Let's show everybody.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.165
{\an3}Yeah!

02:12.232 --> 02:13.933
Come here,
little tadpole.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.874
I think I'll call him Fernando.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.709
Come on, Fernando.

02:22.775 --> 02:27.480
We want to show you
to our friends.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.383
Let's go.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.720
Come on.

02:42.529 --> 02:43.696
{\an1}Hello.

02:43.763 --> 02:44.197
{\an3}Hello.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.500
Hi there.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.638
Good morning,
Mr. Grouper.

02:51.704 --> 02:53.873
Well, good morning, everyone.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.942
Ribbit-ribbit.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.777
{\an3}(Giggling)

02:57.844 --> 02:59.746
What's that, Goby?

02:59.812 --> 03:00.880
It's a tadpole.

03:00.947 --> 03:04.651
Hey, look at that.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.753
He's just a baby.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.755
A baby what?

03:08.821 --> 03:10.356
{\an8}A baby frog.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.192
{\an8}It doesn't look like a frog.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.229
{\an8}When frogs are babies,
they have tails

03:16.296 --> 03:17.730
{\an8}so they can swim
in the water.

03:17.797 --> 03:22.235
{\an8}And later, they grow legs
so they can hop on land.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.370
{\an8}Frogs are amphibians.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.707
{\an8}That means they live
in water and on land.

03:27.774 --> 03:31.811
Fernando is
my favorite amphibian.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.246
I call him Fernando.

03:33.313 --> 03:36.749
Let's think about frogs.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.719
When frogs are babies,
they're called...

03:42.655 --> 03:43.990
{\an3}Tadpoles.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.658
{\an1}Tadpoles.
Yep.

03:45.725 --> 03:49.829
And as they grow up, tadpoles
lose their tails and grow...

03:52.065 --> 03:54.067
{\an3}Legs.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.202
That's right.
They grow legs.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.171
And when they're all
grown up into frogs,

03:58.237 --> 04:00.940
they'll use
their legs to...

04:03.009 --> 04:05.011
{\an3}Hop.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.046
That's right.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.016

If you're hoppy and you know it,
come with me.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.595
Hello, I'd like to see
some froggies, please.

06:02.662 --> 06:06.632
Well, you've certainly come
to the right place.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.837
Welcome to Frog City.
Right, guys?

06:10.903 --> 06:12.205
{\an3}(Croaking)

06:12.271 --> 06:15.274
Froggies!
Can I see them?

06:15.341 --> 06:18.044
Certainly.
Hop this way.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.482
Frogs live
in lots of different places.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.518
As you can see,
this tank has the kinds of trees

06:25.585 --> 06:27.687
that you'd find
in a rainforest.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.389
And the kind of frog that
lives in trees like these

06:30.456 --> 06:33.459
is called a tree frog.
Let's take a look.

06:33.526 --> 06:37.163
Hmm.
I don't see any tree frogs.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.532
Some frogs are
just hard to find

06:39.599 --> 06:41.801
because they have
the same colors

06:41.868 --> 06:43.603
as the places
they live.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.905
It's called
"camouflage."

06:45.972 --> 06:47.240
Well, that tree frog's
camouflage

06:47.306 --> 06:49.842
must work really well.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.210
(Croaking)

06:51.277 --> 06:55.314
There <i> is</i> a frog in there!
We need your help to find him.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.084
Do you see a green tree frog
in there?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.655
(Croaking)

07:02.722 --> 07:04.056
There he is.
He's right there.

07:04.123 --> 07:08.394
Yeah.
He's right on top of that leaf.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.228

07:09.295 --> 07:11.130
(Croaking)

07:11.197 --> 07:14.700
Hark!
Another frog.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.806
As you can see, this tank
looks like the desert.

07:19.872 --> 07:23.342
One kind of frog that lives in
the desert is called a toad.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.212
It's bumpy
and it has spots all over.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.548
{\an8}I need your help.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.517
{\an8}Can you find the toad hiding
in here?

07:33.986 --> 07:34.687
{\an8}(Croaking)

07:34.754 --> 07:37.290
{\an8}Right there.
In the sand.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.559
There he is.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.795
His bumpy skin blends in
with the sand.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.265
That toad was hard to find
because he was camouflaged.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.101
"Toad-ally."

07:49.168 --> 07:50.269

and some popcorn.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.732
What did you get,
Oona?

08:19.799 --> 08:23.402
I got a veggie sandwich

08:23.469 --> 08:26.172

08:36.349 --> 08:41.053
Hop-corn?
That's ridiculous.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.155
You can find frogs
all over the world.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.259
Some live in the trees,
some live in deserts,

08:46.325 --> 08:48.661
and some live in ponds.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.363
GIL:
Here, froggy-froggy.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.966

08:55.234 --> 08:56.168
Shh.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.271
I'm waiting for
a frog to come by.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.306
Frogs love ponds.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.608
I just have to be
really patient

09:02.675 --> 09:06.479
and really, really quiet.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.382
Molly, look.
It's a frog.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.151

09:17.490 --> 09:19.425
Hey, you guys,

09:48.454 --> 09:50.957
(Gasping)

09:52.358 --> 09:55.328
Hey, you guys,
come look.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.431
Whoa!
Fernando's got legs.

09:58.497 --> 10:01.701
{\an3}Wow!

09:58.497 --> 10:01.701
He's got legs.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.769
He's turning
into a frog.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.438
MR. GROUPER:
That's right, Molly.

10:05.504 --> 10:08.407
Tadpoles go through a lot of
changes to grow up into frogs.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.710
{\an1}Like what?

10:10.776 --> 10:14.146
Well, first,
the mommy frog lays eggs.

10:14.213 --> 10:18.284
Then the eggs hatch, and out of
each one comes a little tadpole.

10:18.351 --> 10:24.023
Tadpoles live in the water for a
while and then they grow legs.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.159
Hey, that's what Fernando
looks like right now.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.861
That's right, Goby.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.896
Then after they grow
all four legs,

10:30.963 --> 10:35.301
they lose their tails
and become frogs.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.470
They really change
a lot.

10:37.536 --> 10:41.007
When Fernando's a frog,
we'll take him back to his pond

10:41.073 --> 10:43.709
so he can be with
all the other frogs.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.678

I'm Dr. Frogenstein.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.475
And I'm her assistant,
Eggor.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.412
Once upon a time...

11:19.478 --> 11:21.914
(Thunder crashing)

11:21.981 --> 11:23.182
<i>It was a gloomy day</i>
<i>in Bubblevania.</i>

11:23.249 --> 11:27.553
<i>And so, Dr. Frogenstein</i>
<i>and her assistant</i>

11:27.620 --> 11:29.355
<i>decided to have a picnic.</i>

11:29.422 --> 11:32.458
Mmm, that was delicious, Eggor.
What's for dessert?

11:32.525 --> 11:37.596
Your favorite,
Dr. Frogenstein.

11:37.663 --> 11:41.000
It's a pie!

11:44.270 --> 11:48.274
{\an5}GIL:
<i>But just as they were about</i>
<i>to take a bite...</i>

11:48.340 --> 11:49.542
{\an3}(Babbling)

11:49.608 --> 11:53.212
What's that?

11:53.279 --> 11:55.448
Giant fly, master.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.517
{\an3}(Babbling)

11:58.584 --> 11:59.518
Yikes!
Let's get out of here.

11:59.585 --> 12:03.089
Yes, master.

12:06.425 --> 12:09.161
{\an8}<i>So, Dr. Frogenstein and Eggor</i>
<i>went somewhere else</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:13.332
{\an8}<i>to eat their pie,</i>
<i>but before they could...</i>

12:13.399 --> 12:16.168
{\an9}(Babbling)

12:16.235 --> 12:17.002
{\an8}(Screaming)

12:17.069 --> 12:20.139
{\an8}Eggor, get
the fly swatter!

12:20.206 --> 12:21.507
{\an8}Yes, master.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.413
Well, that was ineffective.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.583
{\an3}(Babbling)

12:30.649 --> 12:34.820
Yikes, master.

12:36.722 --> 12:41.694
We have to get rid of
that nasty giant fly, but how?

12:41.760 --> 12:46.265
Perhaps a giant frog,
Dr. Frogenstein.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.867
A giant frog?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.468
Frogs like
to eat flies.

12:49.535 --> 12:54.440
A giant frog!

12:54.507 --> 12:56.075
(Thunder crashing)

12:56.142 --> 12:57.743
{\an5}GIL:
<i>So, they went back</i>
<i>to Dr. Frogenstein's laboratory</i>

12:57.810 --> 13:01.447
<i>to create a giant frog.</i>

13:01.514 --> 13:02.548
What's that, Eggor?

13:02.615 --> 13:06.252
Giant frog egg,
master.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.586
Of course.

13:07.653 --> 13:11.223
We will create our giant frog
from this giant frog egg.

13:11.290 --> 13:16.395
Eggor, start the electric
frog-nosticator.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.132
Yes, Dr. Frogenstein.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.574
To create our giant frog,

13:28.641 --> 13:32.578
first we start with an egg
and end with a frog.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.580
(Machine beeping)

13:34.647 --> 13:36.849
{\an8}Eggor, what's wrong?

13:36.916 --> 13:40.452
{\an8}Some of these stages are
out of order.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.787
{\an9}Oh, no!

13:41.854 --> 13:44.123
{\an8}Our giant frog
will grow in four stages.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.892
{\an8}We need your help
to put them in order.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.895
We want to grow a giant frog.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.998
First we start with
a frog egg.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.968
The next stage is a tadpole.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.803
Which one of these
is a tadpole,

13:57.870 --> 14:00.573
this one or this one?

14:02.575 --> 14:05.277
That one!
The tadpole.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.278
That's right.

14:06.345 --> 14:10.849
So, that means
this one goes here.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.451
(Computer keys clacking)

14:15.621 --> 14:16.755
(Doorbell ringing)

14:16.822 --> 14:20.292
Someone's at the door.
Yes?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.160
<i>(Babbling)</i>

14:21.227 --> 14:23.796
Uh-oh.
That's the giant fly.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.532
Hurry, Eggor!
Throw the switch.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.768
(Electricity zapping)

14:29.835 --> 14:32.204
(Thunder crashing)

14:41.347 --> 14:43.349

14:43.415 --> 14:46.852
It's a frog!

14:59.331 --> 15:02.901
What did you
do that for?

15:02.968 --> 15:07.439
You were trying to get us.

15:07.506 --> 15:08.941
No, I wasn't.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.645
I just wanted some pie.

15:12.711 --> 15:13.979
{\an9}(Crying)

15:14.046 --> 15:15.781
{\an8}Is that all?
You should have just asked.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.950
{\an9}Oh.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.718
{\an8}May I have some pie,
please?

15:19.785 --> 15:23.555
{\an8}Of course you can.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.391
{\an9}Ooh!

15:25.457 --> 15:28.794
{\an8}GIL:
<i>And so,</i>
<i>Dr. Frogenstein and Eggor</i>

15:28.861 --> 15:30.663
{\an8}<i>shared their pie</i>
<i>with the fly.</i>

{\an8}DEEMA:
Ooh, I think the giant frog
is hungry, too.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.741
{\an8}Yeah.
Um, I should go.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.277
{\an8}(Giggling)

15:45.344 --> 15:49.682
And they all lived
"hoppily" ever after.

15:49.748 --> 15:53.085

15:53.152 --> 15:56.055
Come on, everybody!
It's time to dance.

15:58.657 --> 16:02.428

Get up and dance with us.

17:23.776 --> 17:27.679
and some just walk,
and others can even climb trees.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.748
GIL:
Eep-eep, eep-eep.

17:29.815 --> 17:33.018
Here, little tree frog.
Eep-eep, eep-eep.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.052
What are you doing, Gil?

17:34.119 --> 17:36.722
I'm trying to find
a tree frog.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.858
They have camouflage, so they're
really hard to see.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.059
{\an3}(Barking)

17:41.126 --> 17:41.860
(Screaming)
Oof.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.434
You guys, guess what?
Fernando's a frog now.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.637
We're going to take him home
to his pond.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.071
GUPPIES:
Field trip!

17:53.138 --> 17:56.909
{\an5}MOLLY:
Do you want to come with us
to take Fernando home?

17:59.678 --> 18:02.214
Great.
Come on.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.419
ANNOUNCER:
Buenos dias and hola.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.755
Welcome to the annual
running of the bullfrogs.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.257
(Cheering and applause,
fanfare sounding)

18:12.324 --> 18:14.860
I am your host, Señor Rana,

18:14.927 --> 18:16.628
and this is
my co-host--

18:16.695 --> 18:19.198
Señora Ribbitina.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.302
Today, our frogs
are all grown up,

18:23.368 --> 18:24.970
and with the help
of their runners

18:25.037 --> 18:26.805
they will hop all the way back

18:26.872 --> 18:29.708
to their home in the pond.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.010
Today's course follows
the different stages

18:32.077 --> 18:33.545
in a frog's life.

18:33.612 --> 18:38.584
All frogs and their runners will
begin here in the frog-egg area.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.787
Then, they will hop through town
to the tadpole area,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.689
then through
the new arms-and-legs area,

18:43.755 --> 18:48.627
and finally they will hop
their way down to the pond.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.395
It is so exciting.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.900
And let's begin the race.

18:54.967 --> 19:00.239
On your mark, get set, go!

19:02.708 --> 19:04.676
And there they go.

19:04.743 --> 19:08.881
The frogs and their runners
are leaving the frog-egg area.

19:08.947 --> 19:12.251
This way, Fernando.

19:19.091 --> 19:23.161
And they've made it
to Tadpole Plaza.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.731
{\an1}Woo!

19:25.797 --> 19:27.833
Come on, Fernando.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.801
Go, go, go.

19:32.938 --> 19:33.872
This way.

19:33.939 --> 19:39.645
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, all right.

19:43.749 --> 19:47.886
Come on, Fernando.
You're almost home.

19:48.854 --> 19:53.225
{\an5}RANA:
It looks like Fernando sees
something he wants to eat.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.862
RIBBITINA:
Uh-oh.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.830
That's the wrong way.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.767
Fernando, wait!

20:01.833 --> 20:03.201
RANA:
Oh, no.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.971
It looks like Fernando and his
runners are going the wrong way.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.441
Fernando, wait!

20:13.612 --> 20:15.747
Fernando, you're going
the wrong way.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.883
Don't you want to finish
the race?

20:17.950 --> 20:18.517
{\an1}(Croaking)

20:18.584 --> 20:20.919
Okay, let's go.

20:20.986 --> 20:22.654
{\an5}RANA:
Oh, thank goodness
they're back on track.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.858
But these streets
can be very confusing.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.060
Uh-oh, I think we're lost.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.829
We need to get to
the pond.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.864
We need your help.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.436
Which sign will show us the way
to Fernando's home?

20:37.502 --> 20:41.607
That one, that one,
or that one?

20:44.242 --> 20:46.845
That one.
It goes to the pond.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.780
{\an3}Right.

20:48.847 --> 20:52.651
Come on, Fernando.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.955
{\an5}RANA:
And it looks like all the frogs
have made it back

20:57.022 --> 21:00.692
to their home in the pond,
except Fernando.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.028
Oh, no.
Fernando didn't make it.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.764
(Audience gasping)

21:08.634 --> 21:10.636
(Bubble Puppy whining)

21:12.237 --> 21:14.172
MOLLY:
There they are.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.641
(Crowd cheering)

21:15.707 --> 21:18.243
{\an5}RANA:
Ladies and gentlemen,
here they come at last:

21:18.310 --> 21:20.078
Fernando and his runners.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.279
All right!

21:21.346 --> 21:23.915
{\an6}Come on,
Fernando.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.915
You can do it.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.184
Yeah, hooray!

21:26.251 --> 21:28.887
Bye, Fernando.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.822
We'll miss you.

21:33.892 --> 21:34.993
(Gulping)

21:35.060 --> 21:36.194
(Belching)

21:36.261 --> 21:38.964
(Crowd cheering)

21:41.233 --> 21:43.168
{\an1}Bye-bye.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.770
Bye.
So long.

21:44.836 --> 21:45.937
We'll miss you.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.143
I'm happy that Fernando
made it back home to his pond.

21:51.209 --> 21:54.012
Me, too.
Frogs are cool,

21:54.079 --> 21:57.282
and I'm going to
catch one.

21:57.349 --> 22:00.085
Here, froggy.
We're delicious flies.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.086
Buzz-buzz-buzz.

22:01.153 --> 22:05.157
