WEBVTT

00:21.089 --> 00:22.490
Hello.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.427
Oh, hello. Yes.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.696
Now? Uh, yes.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.431
Of course, of course. Absolutely.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.200
I'll be right there.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.343
Hello?

00:42.443 --> 00:43.977
What?

00:44.078 --> 00:45.613
Wait, are you serious?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.915
Uh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.420
Lionel?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.922
Ah. Oh, my gosh.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.424
Okay.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.892
And, uh,
you must be Imani.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.728
Are you okay?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.296
I-I don't know.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.364
Thank you so much

01:03.464 --> 01:04.432
for coming down at this hour.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.300
Lionel, for you,
at any hour.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.669
I owe your father a lot.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.139
Are these... This is
the police report?

01:11.139 --> 01:15.309
They had my daughter
in a holding cell.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.145
She's in handcuffs.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.612
I am so sorry, but,

01:18.712 --> 01:20.981
Lionel, the charge
is attempted murder.

01:21.782 --> 01:22.883
Next.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.218
Imani, do you feel
clear-headed enough

01:24.318 --> 01:25.386
to speak on your own behalf

01:25.486 --> 01:26.887
when we go
before the judge?

01:26.987 --> 01:28.489
I think so. I-I don't know.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.158
I don't remember
any of what happened.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.461
You don't remember anything?

01:33.561 --> 01:35.396
She's a vice principal at
a grade school, for God's sakes.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.964
Josephine
is my friend.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.532
I've worked
with her for years.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.168
We-we love each other.
I-I would never...

01:40.268 --> 01:41.402
You would
never hurt her.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.736
Next case.
I understand.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.773
We're pleading not guilty.
Your Honor.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.941
They can't possibly think
she meant to kill her.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.178
This is ridiculous. And...

01:50.278 --> 01:51.579
We plead not guilty.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.348
But first we need
to argue for her release.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.185
Next case.
Okay, this next part
should be quick.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.619
Good evening, Your Honor.

01:58.719 --> 02:02.190
It's late, so let's
make this quick.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.694
Todd.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.095
Over here.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.303
Here's your
credit card back.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.004
Thank you.
I need some gum.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.672
I'm just impressed
your credit limit

02:18.772 --> 02:20.874
is high enough to
cover bail at $27,000...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.476
I don't want to
talk about it.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.977
Okay, millionaire.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.216
Look, it's nothing.
It's stupid.

02:28.216 --> 02:32.220
It was this
hospital fundraiser

02:32.220 --> 02:33.354
function thing,

02:33.454 --> 02:35.623
and I went out
after for drinks

02:35.723 --> 02:38.792
with some work people,
and it got...

02:38.892 --> 02:40.494
It got out of hand.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.595
Yeah, drunk, disorderly,

02:41.695 --> 02:42.596
resisting arrest
out of hand.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.897
Did you call Chuck?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.133
No. He's at home,
in bed, asleep.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.868
You know, I was at
home, in bed, asleep.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.570
Okay, I just don't want
anyone in the family

02:49.670 --> 02:50.804
to know that
this happened.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.039
You know,
I'm in the family.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.707
I don't want Chuck
knowing that I was...

02:53.807 --> 02:55.042
Drunk, disorderly,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.510
resisting arrest?
Yeah, I wouldn't either.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.346
Mom. Mom.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
Get off... Todd.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.353
Mom. Hey.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.423
I mean...
Wait, what is...

03:09.523 --> 03:10.858
Wha... What is that?

03:10.958 --> 03:12.393
Is that...

03:12.493 --> 03:14.995
Oh, no. Oh, Todd. Oh, God.
Have you been arrested?

03:15.095 --> 03:16.297
No.
What for?

03:16.397 --> 03:19.267
No, no, this is a recipe.
I bake now.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.568
Allison?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.736
Mom, hey.
I, um...

03:22.836 --> 03:24.037
Wait.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.973
Wait, Todd,
did you pull

03:26.073 --> 03:27.641
your sister out
of her fundraiser

03:27.741 --> 03:29.577
so that she could
come down here

03:29.677 --> 03:30.878
and bail you
out of jail?

03:30.978 --> 03:34.114
I... am afraid so.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.950
On her one big
night out, off work,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.286
and you...

03:38.286 --> 03:40.120
You were arrested?
What were you doing?

03:40.288 --> 03:41.989
Actually, it was, um,

03:42.089 --> 03:45.293
public disorderly... urination.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.428
Public disorderly urination?

03:47.528 --> 03:50.564
What were you doing,
peeing in every direction?

03:50.664 --> 03:51.832
Yeah, kind of. Well, I was out

03:51.932 --> 03:53.166
for a couple beers
with friends...

03:53.301 --> 03:55.303
No, Todd, no... Allison,
I am so, so sorry.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.904
Look-look what
he's done to you,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.071
you are a wreck.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.407
Wait, wait. And
were you crying?

03:59.507 --> 04:00.608
Todd.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.942
I can't even... Wait.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.677
We will talk about this,
but I have to go.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.646
Maybe you should give me
my earrings back right now. Yeah.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.182
I hope he didn't ruin
your whole night, honey.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.586
Todd.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.656
You poor, poor thing.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.224
Disorderly urination?

04:17.325 --> 04:19.159
What? I was actually ticketed
for that once in college.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.662
Oh, so you're a serial
disorderly urinator?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.163
Don't talk about my urine, okay?

04:23.331 --> 04:24.565
I just bailed you
out of jail.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.099
Yeah, with my money.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.335
Okay, let's go.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.404
Oh, I don't know
where my coat is.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.205
Or my car.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.007
Oh, no.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.610
Wow. Who are you, me?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.515
Imani, try again.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.050
Try to jog your memory.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.786
See if you can recall anything.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.955
I don't...

04:48.055 --> 04:50.190
The cake.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.092
I opened the box.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.261
I think I put
a candle on it?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.430
Mm-hmm.
Maybe not.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.865
I remember...

04:57.965 --> 04:59.066
it was Josephine's birthday,

04:59.166 --> 05:01.134
and we were going to sing

05:01.234 --> 05:02.603
in the teacher's lounge,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.538
and then...

05:06.006 --> 05:07.741
And then...

05:07.841 --> 05:09.677
Nothing.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.945
Until...

05:12.045 --> 05:13.881
the screaming.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.383
The police
were there,

05:15.383 --> 05:19.019
and I had her blood...

05:19.119 --> 05:20.554
on my hand.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.123
I'm still not even sure
what really happened.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.093
Well, three eye-witnesses say

05:26.193 --> 05:27.628
that you took the cake knife

05:27.728 --> 05:30.664
and plunged it into
Josephine Velez's shoulder,

05:30.764 --> 05:33.467
and that if she hadn't
moved at the last second,

05:33.567 --> 05:35.769
it could have
gone into her heart.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.038
You're both
very lucky

05:38.138 --> 05:39.773
it wasn't much worse.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.009
That night,
after court,

05:42.109 --> 05:45.579
driving me home, my dad...

05:45.679 --> 05:46.947
he was scared of me.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.782
I could tell.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.317
It's so weird.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.454
We've always been so close, and

05:53.554 --> 05:56.323
now he's
afraid of me.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.726
And I'm afraid, too.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.231
What's wrong with me?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.834
I don't know,

06:06.934 --> 06:08.669
but we are going to find out.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.841
And, Imani, I'm not afraid.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.076
<i>You know, Todd,</i>

06:16.176 --> 06:17.645
I just don't
understand.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.580
You have been
doing so well.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.948
Uh, where are
the teachers?

06:21.048 --> 06:21.949
Why aren't they lounging?

06:22.049 --> 06:22.950
Because they
are teaching.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.251
We're early.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.886
Todd, you've been
putting in all those hours

06:25.986 --> 06:27.154
to get your license back,

06:27.254 --> 06:28.789
and then,
all of a sudden,

06:28.889 --> 06:31.191
you are talking to Veronica.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.126
And you got arrested. Again.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.097
I am a great disappointment,
and mystery, even to myself.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.467
Todd, you are backsliding.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.835
What do you think about therapy?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.537
Or a life coach?

06:43.637 --> 06:44.505
Teachers?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.106
Teachers, if you
can hear me,

06:46.206 --> 06:47.475
please show up. Please.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.610
Calling Allison
to bail you out.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.912
Did you really think that
I wouldn't find out?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.313
Sort of?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.148
Todd, I find
out everything.
I know that...

06:55.248 --> 06:57.250
Excuse me, can I help you two?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.521
Yes, apparently
I need a lot of it.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.222
I was standing right there.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.291
Yes...
I mean, I was
right there.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.727
I had the cake plates,
and she just...

07:06.827 --> 07:08.662
I understand, yes.
But did you know...

07:08.762 --> 07:11.298
She could have stabbed me.
I could have gotten stabbed.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.833
But she stabbed
the principal, Ms. Velez.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.969
Yes. Yes, well,
Imani was probably still upset.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.170
I mean, obviously.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.072
She stabbed her.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.708
Upset? About what?

07:20.808 --> 07:23.110
Well, Imani wanted
the principal job,

07:23.210 --> 07:24.311
but Josephine got it.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.914
They used to be real close.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.382
So they had a falling out?
Oh, I don't know.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.185
I mean, I didn't think
she was that upset.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.654
But she did stab her.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.388
Wait, so did she stab her or...

07:35.523 --> 07:36.657
Over a promotion?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.125
I mean, who wouldn't want
to be principal?

07:38.225 --> 07:41.529
I would, but I wouldn't
stab anyone to get it.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.263
And neither would Imani.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.766
And yet... she did.
She stabbed her.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.535
You know, I'm starting to think

07:47.635 --> 07:49.302
someone might have stabbed
someone in this situation.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.804
So she never said
anything to you

07:50.904 --> 07:53.340
about wanting to cause
real harm to Ms. Velez,

07:53.440 --> 07:54.775
or remove her from her job?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.443
Or the planet?

07:56.544 --> 07:57.845
Look, all I know is
we were singing

07:57.945 --> 07:59.947
"Happy Birthday" to
Josephine, and then...

08:00.047 --> 08:01.248
She stabbed her. Yeah.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.550
None of it
makes any sense.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.884
But the video doesn't lie.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.452
The video?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.556
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.459
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you. Thank you.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.863
This is actually
quite suspenseful.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.598
It's like a found footage
horror movie.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.833
It's like
<i>The Blair Wits Process.</i>

08:19.933 --> 08:20.868
Those poor kids.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.770
<i>Blair Witch Project,</i> Mom.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.237
And that movie wasn't real.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.439
I am talking about the children

08:26.574 --> 08:27.975
you made me drag
to see that movie

08:28.075 --> 08:29.176
for your eighth birthday.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.145
13 hysterical boys.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.346
Half wet their pants.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.182
And, uh, who was
actually filming this?

08:35.282 --> 08:38.151
This is Horatio Menendez,
the Spanish teacher.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.452
This is his phone.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.354
And there's Imani
with the cake.

08:41.454 --> 08:44.592
And that is the victim. Principal
Josephine Velez.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.327
Mm-hmm.
Mm. This is tricky.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.762
How do you build a defense

08:48.862 --> 08:50.263
when they have actual
footage of the crime?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.900
We do not
have legitimate motive.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.802
Imani has no
criminal history,

08:54.902 --> 08:57.237
and she is a dedicated teacher. Wait,
wait, wait.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.272
Look over there, by the table.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.610
She just
sort of slumped.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.612
Wait.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.346
Is her hand

09:06.446 --> 09:07.648
shaking slightly?

09:07.748 --> 09:08.949
Look at that.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.852
This is so amazingly scary.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.454
And her eyes look odd.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.725
Glassy. Yes.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.192
There is something
not right with her.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.694
Those are tremors.
I'm certain of it.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.295
No really. Imani, I'm fine.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.332
Oh, she's-she's got the knife.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.801
Oh, my God!

09:27.901 --> 09:30.037
We all need to show this
video to three other people

09:30.137 --> 09:32.072
so she doesn't climb
out here and kill us.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.142
We need to have Imani
examined by a doctor.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.110
And you as well.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.086
Thank you so much for
fitting Imani in today.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.321
Sure. I mean,
the ER lab is fast,

09:48.421 --> 09:49.522
but this is gonna be expensive.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.858
Oh, her father
can afford it.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.659
Oh.
He owns
Wieden Kennedy,

09:51.759 --> 09:53.927
the ad agency.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.462
He was the first
big client

09:55.562 --> 09:56.830
that I pulled in.
Mm-hmm.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.666
And Imani
is his prized

09:58.666 --> 09:59.833
and cherished daughter,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.703
just like
you are mine.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.138
Mom, I, um...

10:05.238 --> 10:07.741
Oh, I know. Todd.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.042
I cannot believe

10:09.142 --> 10:10.410
that you had to bail
him out last night.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.045
I am so sorry, Allison.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.814
And he ruined your
fun night out. You...

10:13.914 --> 10:16.283
I didn't bail him out,
he bailed me out.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.785
I was arrested

10:17.885 --> 10:19.753
for public disorderly conduct.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.655
Wha...
Dr. Grant?

10:21.755 --> 10:22.790
Hi.
The neuro consult

10:22.890 --> 10:24.191
says there's
nothing abnormal.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.494
So that rules out seizures
caused by brain tumors.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.596
I'm sorry, you were arrested?

10:29.697 --> 10:31.665
Okay. So, and also,
her bloodwork,

10:31.765 --> 10:34.367
EKG and angiogram all
confirm no heart issues.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.303
I did notice
she's been taking Orcholax,

10:36.403 --> 10:38.305
a cholesterol drug,
for about 6 months.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.807
Okay.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.609
And her bloodwork shows
drastically elevated CK

10:42.710 --> 10:44.477
between then and now.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.946
That could be
the Orcholax.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.347
There's no known listed
side effects online,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.349
but it might be worth
talking to a specialist.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.252
Wonderful. Do you know
of anyone in that field?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.621
Actually, yes.
Dr. Newton Featherstone.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.556
Okay.
Thanks.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.591
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Paging Dr. Grant
to trauma room four.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.328
Dr. Grant to trauma room four.
Sorry, Mom,
a trauma's come in, so...

11:01.428 --> 11:03.463
What? Wait, Allison,
you cannot just tell me

11:03.563 --> 11:06.066
that you were arrested,
and then flee like a criminal.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.134
I'm not fleeing like a criminal,

11:07.234 --> 11:08.535
I'm being called to save a life,

11:08.635 --> 11:10.070
like a doctor.
Okay, but

11:10.170 --> 11:12.039
we will deal with this. Yup.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.641
You lied to me.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.943
Uh, which lie are
we talking about?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.779
You weren't arrested.
Ah. Yes. Okay.

11:18.879 --> 11:19.980
But that's a good
thing, though, right?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.314
For me? I'm
the good one here.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.315
I was helping her.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.251
No. Good morning, Yu Jin.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.454
You lied about lying.
That's a double lie.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.655
Colluding with
your sister.

11:28.756 --> 11:29.923
Collu...
I wasn't collu...

11:30.023 --> 11:32.025
Again, me good,
her bad.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.594
Both of you.
Lying. To my face.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.963
Your mother.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.598
Oh, Allison.
Good God.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.768
What is going
on with her?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.035
Right, that's right,
she's the one

11:42.135 --> 11:43.536
in trouble here,
because I was just...

11:43.636 --> 11:45.005
Leading her down a path.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.874
I wasn't leading her
down any paths.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.241
This was her.
Believe me,

11:48.341 --> 11:50.443
I was just as shocked
as you. Shocked.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.645
What is happening with her?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.647
Is her life
falling apart?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.383
I don't expect
this kind of thing

11:56.483 --> 11:58.351
from Allison.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.486
What if she loses

11:59.586 --> 12:01.889
her medical license? Or her job?

12:01.989 --> 12:04.925
Wow... This is what it's like.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.359
To be the child complained to,

12:06.459 --> 12:08.028
and not the child
complained about.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
It's not
a competition, Todd.
No, no, no, no,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.498
I'm not competing,
I'm just saying,

12:11.598 --> 12:14.234
she's in trouble
and I'm giving you advice.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.303
It's like
I'm the responsible one.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.637
I like it.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.106
<i>Dr. Featherstone,</i>

12:19.206 --> 12:21.041
have you seen
this kind of thing before?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.443
Not this particular
reaction, no.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.446
But there's no doubt in
my mind this cholesterol drug

12:26.546 --> 12:28.982
caused a change
in her brain chemistry.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.818
How can you be sure?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.285
The "glassy" eye,
the-the tremors.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.021
It all indicates
she was suffering

12:34.121 --> 12:35.923
from a neuro ADR side effect.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.291
Or a dissociative blackout.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.193
Yes, brought on by new chemicals

12:40.293 --> 12:41.929
introduced into
her system.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.931
Orcholax,

12:44.031 --> 12:45.966
it's made by Volthrupp pharmaceuticals.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.835
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Those money-hungry

12:47.935 --> 12:50.103
sham scientists
hide and downplay

12:50.203 --> 12:51.538
those rare side effects

12:51.638 --> 12:53.706
when it should be
landing them all in jail.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.475
So, this blackout,

12:55.575 --> 12:57.644
she wouldn't remember
committing a crime?

12:57.744 --> 13:00.848
I'd go as far as to say she
would not be responsible for it.

13:01.849 --> 13:06.519
And would you be willing
to testify to that effect?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.655
I'd be delighted.

13:14.761 --> 13:15.662
Attorney Wright?

13:15.762 --> 13:17.597
Uh, Your Honor,

13:17.697 --> 13:20.400
my witness will
be here any moment.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.769
I promise you.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.373
But maybe a short recess?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.208
Five minutes,
no more.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.210
Thank you.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.279
I'll be right back.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.685
Hello?

13:38.785 --> 13:41.054
Todd. Where is Featherstone?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.290
I saw Featherstone drive
past the courthouse,

13:43.390 --> 13:45.893
and I followed him to Volthrupp.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.460
Oh, why? What is he...

13:47.560 --> 13:50.230
I am literally watching him
getting an employee badge

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
and a parking pass.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.901
Pretty sure he works here now.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.768
Oh, my God.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.304
They've hired him.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.973
To stop him
from testifying.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.742
They have bought our witness.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.948
Oh, no.
That seems older than me.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.349
Geez.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.385
Your mother called me in here.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.254
Uh, no, that was me,
but you bought it.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.288
Listen,

14:15.388 --> 14:17.090
I am trying to find

14:17.190 --> 14:19.159
somebody inside
Volthrupp to talk to.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.327
I don't want
any part of this.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.528
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.430
Remember when you
found that mole

14:23.530 --> 14:25.465
inside Portland General Electric
for the McDowell case?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.634
You set up that fake meeting
with that guy

14:27.734 --> 14:29.269
to commiserate,
but it actually ended up

14:29.369 --> 14:30.737
just being an info shakedown?

14:30.837 --> 14:32.605
Yes.
So, I did that,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.407
but I just copied and pasted
everything you did,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.009
and changed it all to Volthrupp,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.111
but I forgot
to change your fake email

14:38.211 --> 14:39.980
to my fake
email, so...

14:40.080 --> 14:41.949
has anybody reached out
to say they wanted to talk?

14:41.949 --> 14:44.617
Anyone willing to spill
the beans on Volthrupp?

14:44.717 --> 14:47.454
Wow, first forgery,
and now plagiarism.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.555
A new low.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.690
Huh, I got mail.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.959
Casey Manthine,

14:52.059 --> 14:53.526
former executive assistant,

14:53.626 --> 14:55.395
would love to
"catch a coffee" with you

14:55.495 --> 14:57.664
and "rip those jerks a new one."

14:57.764 --> 14:59.366
Wow, amazing.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.468
"Today, question mark,
At 4:00 p.m., question mark.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.536
Outside the Burlingame
Fred Meyers."

15:03.636 --> 15:04.804
Fantastic.
Can you forward me that?

15:04.972 --> 15:05.805
I actually got to go.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.040
Where is your mother?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.342
She's, uh,
handling a private matter.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.878
You shouldn't ask. It's private.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.882
I need to change my email.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.719
So, it all comes
down to sentencing.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.721
The goal is
to keep you out of jail.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.023
What?
Yeah...

15:23.123 --> 15:25.158
Well, it would be
brief, but yes, jail.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.593
And to make sure that

15:26.693 --> 15:29.029
your medical license
is not revoked.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.497
It was one night out.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.999
And that's
all it takes.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.300
So, Allison,
you need to

15:33.400 --> 15:35.068
write a letter
to the judge

15:35.168 --> 15:36.503
asking for leniency.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.305
You're making me
sound like I'm a murderer.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.173
Allison. Okay,

15:40.273 --> 15:41.541
so, in this letter,
you need to say

15:41.641 --> 15:44.011
that this was a very
unusual episode for you,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.345
and that you regret it.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.813
Oh, and that
you're a doctor.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.115
Write that right there,
that you're a doctor,

15:48.215 --> 15:49.216
and that you
spend day...

15:49.316 --> 15:51.051
all day
helping people,

15:51.151 --> 15:52.819
and that you've
never, ever

15:52.919 --> 15:55.422
done anything wrong,
et cetera, et cetera.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.290
Other than join
a dating app.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.496
Todd told you. I knew it.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.099
Have you told Chuck about...

16:07.367 --> 16:09.436
I haven't told Chuck

16:09.536 --> 16:12.372
anything about myself
in a very long time.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.640
Not about the dating app,

16:13.740 --> 16:15.175
even though
I didn't do anything,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.544
not about drinking too much
and getting arrested.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.312
And breaking a policeman's nose.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.881
Of course I broke his nose,
he grabbed me from behind.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.285
I was shocked,
and that was my first reaction.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.819
Good girl.
Thank you.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.788
But I'm also trained
for medical emergencies,

16:28.888 --> 16:31.091
and I reset it for him
in the back of the cop car.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.559
Very good girl.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.596
Allison, not telling Chuck

16:36.696 --> 16:38.698
is tantamount to lying to him.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.467
And you never lied
to your husband.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.070
I never lied to Harry, no.
I'm talking about Dad.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.339
Well, that was different.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.375
You were unhappy.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.477
I never cheated on your father.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.379
But maybe you should have.

16:53.946 --> 16:58.085
Are you unhappy, Allison?
That's the question.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.195
Casey? Manthine?

17:08.295 --> 17:09.962
Oh, hey. Hi.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.631
Lyle, right?
Yes, yeah, uh-huh.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.533
Lyle. Nice
to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.801
Another warrior

17:14.901 --> 17:16.469
against Volthrupp.
Oh, yeah.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.804
That place is the worst.
I can't even.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.673
Such hideous disregard
for human life. Hmm.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.142
So, why'd they fire you?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.111
Oh, I, uh, I just lost it

17:24.111 --> 17:25.812
and attacked
a co-worker one day.

17:25.912 --> 17:29.282
Wow, that's so extra.
Mm-hmm.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.751
I mean, they got me
for lying on my timecard.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.020
Why'd you do it?

17:34.121 --> 17:36.756
Oh, uh, as you said,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.825
hideous disregard
for human life. Mmm.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.127
And all those dangerous drugs,

17:40.227 --> 17:42.595
and experimenting
on people willy-nilly.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.197
You don't
know the half of it.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.134
I have seen things
people wouldn't believe.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.001
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.704
You know, I was thinking about
trying to sneak back in there

17:51.804 --> 17:54.474
and find some dirt. Expose them.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.809
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.910
Okay.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.246
Well, you didn't
hear this from me...

17:59.346 --> 18:01.148
...but if you
can get up to

18:01.148 --> 18:02.849
the second floor
archive data room,

18:02.949 --> 18:04.451
you'll find all
the company skeletons

18:04.551 --> 18:05.618
on the C-drive,

18:05.718 --> 18:07.220
password "Tannhäuser."

18:07.320 --> 18:11.591
That is great info. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.892
So are we getting
coffee and plotting

18:12.992 --> 18:14.261
the downfall
of Big Pharma or what?

18:14.361 --> 18:15.862
Uh, absolutely.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.630
Yeah, I could
use a coffee.
Yeah, let's do it.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.399
I haven't really plotted
yet today, though.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.733
Oh, we're gonna get right to it.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.235
Got all the dirt.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.505
You know, you do realize
that they could be

18:25.605 --> 18:26.873
giving you a drug
for anything.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.542
Alopecia, stuttering,
bladder control.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.778
No, it's just
a mild anxiety drug,

18:31.878 --> 18:33.480
and I'm fine for that.
Right?

18:33.580 --> 18:34.681
I shouldn't have
said yes to this.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.016
Look, it's fine, okay?

18:37.184 --> 18:40.187
I won't take the pills.
I'll fake it. Okay.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.589
And you owe me for taking the
heat with Mom for your arrest.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.656
Shh.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.658
How's that going, anyway?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.595
Is she prepping you
for your hearing or whatever?

18:48.695 --> 18:49.762
Yes, thank you.
And thank you,

18:49.862 --> 18:50.963
by the way,
for telling her

18:51.063 --> 18:52.199
that that was me
on the dating app.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.234
I did not tell her that,
she just knew.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.369
She figured it out.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.539
Also, she's just trying to help.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.040
You should really
listen to her, you know.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.975
She really has
your best interests at heart.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.412
You know,
that night I was arrested,

19:05.512 --> 19:09.015
I was wearing Mom's earrings
and a dress that she bought me,

19:09.115 --> 19:11.418
and they're passing
around champagne,

19:11.518 --> 19:12.652
which I don't even like.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.555
Mom likes champagne.
But I'm drinking it.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.357
And I'm thinking...

19:17.457 --> 19:19.025
who am I?

19:19.125 --> 19:21.694
Like, is this who I want to be?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.129
Mm.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.030
And I just

19:24.130 --> 19:26.032
was so ready to let loose

19:26.132 --> 19:27.867
and forget about everything,

19:27.967 --> 19:29.736
about who I am,

19:29.836 --> 19:31.738
whoever that is.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.005
And it just got...

19:33.105 --> 19:35.475
Out of hand.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.444
Yeah.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.745
Todd Wright?
Hmm?

19:38.845 --> 19:39.746
Oh, hello. Hi.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.080
It seems we don't have

19:41.248 --> 19:42.815
an authorization
from your physician.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.484
Oh, she's right here.
This is my physician.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.952
Yeah, she'll sign anything.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.287
Yeah, hey, what the hell?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.521
Who cares if I lose
my medical license

19:48.621 --> 19:49.522
or you destroy some brain cells?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.890
Where do I sign?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.325
Ha, ha, ha, she's so funny.
She's my doctor.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.960
She's always does this.
You guys should make

19:54.060 --> 19:55.995
a drug for snarkiness.
Okay, are we all signed?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.630
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.366
You lead the way.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.435
Okay.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.338
Hope you still have hair.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.707
So are there any, uh,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.642
adverse side effects
I should know about?

20:09.742 --> 20:11.511
Well, in very
rare instances,

20:11.611 --> 20:14.814
patients have experienced
numbing or tingling

20:14.914 --> 20:17.049
in their hands
and feet.
Hmm? Ow! Ow!

20:17.149 --> 20:18.418
Ow.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.620
You got me
right in the shoulder.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.556
I thought this was
going to be a pill.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.793
Okay, I'll be back
to check on you in ten minutes.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.429
Just stay on the table.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.997
Okay.
Hmm.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.187
Okay.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.424
Okay.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.991
If you can get to

20:59.091 --> 21:00.327
the second floor
archive data room,

21:00.427 --> 21:02.329
you'll find all
the company skeletons

21:02.329 --> 21:05.031
on the C-drive,
password "Tannhäuser."

21:05.131 --> 21:06.366
"Tannhäuser."

21:08.134 --> 21:09.902
Someone's a <i>Blade Runner</i> fan.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.805
Come on.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.641
Come on.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.042
Yes. Okay.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.210
All right. Okay.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.081
There he is.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.350
That's him.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.417
Hey, stop!
Uh, no.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.152
No!
Hey!

21:34.727 --> 21:36.463
No.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.667
Oh, my...

21:56.082 --> 21:57.550
The hell...

21:58.651 --> 22:00.152
Uh... Okay.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.656
Okay.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.958
No.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.960
Wait, uh...

22:08.060 --> 22:09.396
Okay.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.399
Okay.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.100
He is completely ridiculous.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.468
And by allowing
these antics,

22:15.568 --> 22:16.403
we enable him.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.505
He uses my techniques,

22:18.605 --> 22:21.508
my email, my...

22:22.308 --> 22:24.210
Uh-huh.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.612
It's you. It's him.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.881
Okay, Lyle.
Lyle, I'm sending you a file.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.583
I'm not trying to rhyme.
I just don't have time.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.752
To explain what I mean.
God, stop.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.522
Okay, I am uploading
a file to this laptop,

22:35.622 --> 22:38.458
and I am going to
send to yo...

22:39.792 --> 22:41.127
You dated this idiot?

22:41.227 --> 22:45.131
He was fun,
and now we're done.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.442
No.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.576
Damn it.

22:58.745 --> 23:02.214
Hey, Thomas? Thomas?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.316
Thomas, hey.
I'm not Thomas.
I'm Clyde.

23:04.451 --> 23:05.918
Right, Clyde. Yes, of course.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.654
Um, listen, I am Ezekiel

23:07.754 --> 23:09.456
here with corporate
finance licensing

23:09.556 --> 23:10.723
HR feedback loop, and...

23:10.823 --> 23:12.625
Are you the one here
to lead the demo?

23:17.029 --> 23:19.165
Yes.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.267
Yes, I am.

23:24.871 --> 23:25.772
Uh...

23:25.872 --> 23:27.474
Yes. Hello.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.576
Well, uh, what
a wonderful day

23:29.676 --> 23:32.278
to learn about, um...
To learn, uh...

23:32.378 --> 23:35.047
Email.
Email. Yes.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.483
And how to turn the damn thing

23:36.483 --> 23:38.150
on and off. Right.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.352
Right, yes, the basics.

23:40.487 --> 23:45.157
Okay, uh, well,
this here is the device,

23:45.257 --> 23:46.559
and it seems to still be
uploading a file.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.595
What does that even mean?
What is "uploading"?

23:48.695 --> 23:50.296
I don't know.
God, I hate computers.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.231
Yeah, don't we all?

23:52.331 --> 23:53.900
Okay, okay, the upload
is done, but, uh...

23:55.401 --> 23:56.736
I can't seem to... My hands...

23:56.836 --> 23:57.970
I'm just...

23:58.070 --> 23:59.972
Uh, these hands
are really giving me

24:00.072 --> 24:01.240
trouble today.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.509
Okay, you know what?
Uh...

24:02.509 --> 24:04.010
Why don't we have a volunteer

24:04.110 --> 24:05.812
come on up here and do
some up-close learning, huh?

24:05.912 --> 24:07.714
You, sir?
You're-you're quite vocal.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.415
You want me up there?
Yeah, yeah,
what's your name?

24:09.516 --> 24:10.416
I'm Gavin.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.784
Oh, Gavin, great.

24:11.884 --> 24:12.885
Let's everyone give
a round of applause

24:12.985 --> 24:14.420
for Gavin, and, uh,

24:14.521 --> 24:16.188
let's send an email, huh?
Why not?

24:16.288 --> 24:17.890
Um, so, now, you're gonna

24:17.990 --> 24:19.325
click there with
your working hands.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.027
No, I'm trying
to point to the...

24:21.127 --> 24:23.863
Um, no, no, just use
the touch pad right there

24:23.963 --> 24:26.298
and move those folders

24:26.398 --> 24:28.000
to-to that window. Yeah.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.102
No, no, you got to press down
with one finger... Oh.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.540
...and just hold and slide.
Hold and slide.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.744
Oh, um...
Whoops, whoops, big mistake.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.445
Uh, let's not
look at that, folks.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.180
Let's close that. Can you close?
'Cause I can't click it.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.549
Yeah, let's just close.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.750
Okay, now this is
attaching an attachment.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.084
You're gonna
want to learn this.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.118
There might be a quiz.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.386
You're talking nonsense.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.655
Okay, j-just now,
put all of that

24:48.755 --> 24:50.790
into an email
to "L dot Burton."

24:50.890 --> 24:53.560
Just type as I talk,
please. L dot Burton.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.828
"At." It's the
"at" symbol.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.463
Here, I'll hold
"shift" down for you.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.898
Okay, L. Burton

24:58.998 --> 25:01.167
at Crestfoldingsong.com.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.903
Oh, wow, you're actually
a very fast typist.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.972
I'm not an idiot,
I just prefer typewriters.

25:06.072 --> 25:06.973
Okay, and now

25:07.073 --> 25:08.240
we are going to,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.409
uh, send, send.
Send. Send it, please.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.644
Just click that
button right there.

25:11.744 --> 25:12.745
Click it. Great, sent.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.046
Wonderful.
We've done it.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.281
Okay, everybody,

25:15.381 --> 25:16.282
thank you all for attending,

25:16.382 --> 25:17.349
and let's give Gavin

25:17.449 --> 25:19.051
a big round of applause, okay?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.087
Oh! Oh!

25:22.254 --> 25:23.990
Hi.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.698
Your Honor, this video
conclusively proves

25:31.798 --> 25:33.600
that Imani's actions
were a direct result

25:33.600 --> 25:34.867
of the drug
she was on.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.869
She can't
introduce this.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.605
This research was
stolen yesterday

25:38.605 --> 25:39.772
by someone masquerading

25:39.872 --> 25:41.407
as a drug
trial patient.

25:41.507 --> 25:42.809
Someone who fits
the description

25:42.909 --> 25:46.245
of Ms. Wright's son
Todd precisely.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.814
Is this true?

25:47.914 --> 25:49.882
That seems totally out of
character for you, Ms. Wright.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.150
Your Honor,

25:51.250 --> 25:52.619
in <i>Van Buskirk
vs. Amon,</i> 2007,

25:52.719 --> 25:54.854
you ruled that
a private journal

25:54.954 --> 25:56.723
stolen by
a housekeeper

25:56.823 --> 25:57.957
could be used
as evidence

25:58.057 --> 25:59.258
in a murder trial.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.827
Your client stabbed Josephine...

26:00.927 --> 26:03.295
Because Volthrupp covered
up the side effects,

26:03.395 --> 26:04.997
the dangerous side
effects, of the drug.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.299
Your Honor, what
if other people

26:07.399 --> 26:08.801
out there have taken this,

26:08.901 --> 26:11.638
and they've hurt themselves,
or... or loved ones?

26:11.638 --> 26:13.505
For health and safety
of the public,

26:13.640 --> 26:16.075
we cannot allow
big drug companies

26:16.175 --> 26:18.645
to bury the results
of their research for profit.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.279
I'm sorry.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.782
Motion to suppress granted.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.825
Stop using
my email addresses.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.661
What are you talking about?

26:34.661 --> 26:35.728
You gave my email to some
"Netty Carbine"

26:35.828 --> 26:36.996
at the Portland Computer Source,

26:37.096 --> 26:38.530
and now she's reaching
out to connect with

26:38.665 --> 26:40.199
"the young man
with the floppy hands."

26:40.299 --> 26:41.500
What does that
even mean?

26:41.668 --> 26:43.102
Oh, she must have seen me
onstage at the...

26:43.202 --> 26:45.437
Wait, what did you say
her name was again?

26:45.537 --> 26:46.673
Netty Carbine.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.408
I saw your demo
at the computer shop.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.843
Your hands got better?

26:50.943 --> 26:53.412
Oh, yes, all better.
Uh, thank you.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.981
So, how can we help you?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.783
Well, when I saw
that video the other day,

26:56.883 --> 26:58.150
I couldn't believe it.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.952
I mean, those people
looked exactly like

27:00.052 --> 27:02.689
my sister LuAnn before she died.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.291
And, uh, how did she die?

27:05.391 --> 27:07.426
She drove off a cliff.

27:07.526 --> 27:10.797
My God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.833
But it was the tremors
and the glazed eyes.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.768
I mean, she had
that look exactly.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.071
I thought that
if you had that video,

27:19.171 --> 27:22.709
then maybe you might know
what really happened with her.

27:22.709 --> 27:25.011
And was your sister,
by any chance,

27:25.111 --> 27:27.246
taking a drug called Orcholax?

27:27.346 --> 27:28.848
I don't know.

27:28.948 --> 27:33.352
But I do have her papers
and her records in my garage.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.721
I-I could look at them,

27:34.721 --> 27:36.723
and, uh, maybe
tomorrow, I could...

27:36.723 --> 27:38.725
How-how about
tonight?

27:38.725 --> 27:39.859
We could
drive you home

27:39.959 --> 27:41.027
and we could
look together.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.796
Okay. I don't know what's there,

27:43.896 --> 27:45.898
but sure, why not?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.901
I live in a garage,
so we're good.

27:51.337 --> 27:55.074
Okay, I've got this in order,
and the condition of release.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.343
All right, uh, have you written
the letter to the judge?

27:57.443 --> 27:58.778
Yeah, I did.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.146
Okay, great. Do you want to, um,

28:00.246 --> 28:02.448
do you want to practice it?

28:06.585 --> 28:10.122
"Your Honor,
I've never done anything wrong.

28:10.222 --> 28:13.359
"Never acted out,
never broke curfew,

28:13.459 --> 28:14.794
"never did drugs,

28:14.894 --> 28:17.864
"never dated a boy
my parents didn't like. Never.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.799
"The other
night, I did

28:19.899 --> 28:21.567
"a few things
wrong in a row.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.236
"I am sorry I broke a window
and a policeman's nose.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.773
"But, otherwise,

28:26.773 --> 28:28.307
"I'm not really sorry.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.442
"I'm not sorry
I went a little crazy.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.111
"I'm not sorry
I broke the rules.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.013
"Because, after
a lifetime of doing

28:34.113 --> 28:35.681
"what everyone else
wanted me to do,

28:35.782 --> 28:37.049
"getting all
the way

28:37.149 --> 28:39.651
"to age 34 without
acting out,

28:39.786 --> 28:41.020
"maybe I should be

28:41.120 --> 28:42.989
"celebrated instead of punished.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.991
"Maybe we should have
a little party.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.793
"Sincerely,

28:46.793 --> 28:49.862
Dr. Allison
Eleanor Wright Grant."

28:51.697 --> 28:54.633
Great. You think the judge
will go for that?

28:54.801 --> 28:57.169
I hope so.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.073
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.875
Welcome to the club.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.511
I mean, how-how-how do you
expect me to help you, Allison?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.814
I actually didn't ask
for you to help me.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.715
Are you-- are you this unhappy,

29:09.816 --> 29:11.918
that you're just gonna
sabotage everything?

29:12.018 --> 29:14.653
Do you want to leave Chuck?
Do you want to lose your job?

29:14.821 --> 29:16.522
Do you want
to go to jail?

29:16.622 --> 29:17.656
No, and yes.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.191
I mean, it-it changes.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.893
It... No,
I'm happy.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.528
I'm happy like
you and Dad were happy.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.831
I don't want to talk about that,
that is very complicated...

29:24.831 --> 29:26.065
Like you and Harry were happy.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.167
Allison.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.969
You're conflating something.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.470
Harry was a weak man.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.205
He was a weak man
who did not know

29:33.305 --> 29:35.507
how to step up to the plate
and actually be a man.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.277
And-and you are
going to tell me,

29:38.377 --> 29:40.379
blame me, and tell me that

29:40.479 --> 29:42.148
that, somehow,
has something to do with,

29:42.248 --> 29:43.749
with this particular
life moment of yours?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.085
No, you're right, Mom,
because you're always right,

29:46.185 --> 29:48.720
and there's no point
in arguing with you, okay?

29:48.855 --> 29:50.522
This is on me. I did it.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.359
I snapped,
just like your client.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.760
Just like Harry,

29:54.861 --> 29:56.963
and maybe I'm the next one
to flee to Iceland.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.231
Allison, please,
you're not fleeing anywhere.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.867
Don't worry, Mom,
I will see you

30:00.867 --> 30:02.134
in court before then.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.170
Oh, wait. Wait, Allison, honey.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.437
Don't forget your letter.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.106
Don't forget this great,
wonderful letter.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.444
Ugh, voice mail.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.146
Hey, Susan, look,

30:14.246 --> 30:16.916
I know that the info
we scored at Netty's garage

30:17.016 --> 30:18.350
was a big win.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.586
I mean, her sister was
a part of the original

30:20.686 --> 30:22.088
Orcholax drug trials,

30:22.188 --> 30:24.623
but it was initially developed
by a Dr. Norman Smith.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.959
He just used his credit card
here, like, an hour ago.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.594
Only thing is, nobody looks like

30:28.694 --> 30:30.396
an important
doctor person, so...

30:30.496 --> 30:33.132
I will keep you posted,
okay? Bye.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.767
Um...

30:36.969 --> 30:38.370
Excuse me? Hi?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.505
Hi.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.309
That's on tap, right? Cool.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.977
Um...

30:45.077 --> 30:47.646
Hi, there. Can you just, um...

30:47.746 --> 30:49.148
Oop, selfie.

30:58.457 --> 30:59.225
Norman?

30:59.325 --> 31:01.160
Hmm?
Doctor?

31:01.994 --> 31:03.930
Ah.

31:03.930 --> 31:04.931
Hey.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.498
Get me

31:06.598 --> 31:10.736
a Harvey Wallbanger, will you?

31:11.837 --> 31:13.539
Coming right up.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.546
Hello.
Yeah, he'll be fine.

31:20.646 --> 31:21.948
Think something's
going around.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.082
You guys should
get out of here.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.750
Okay, stop.

31:24.850 --> 31:25.985
Turn around.
What?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.386
Coffee.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.755
We'll need
lots of coffee. Okay.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.191
Orcholax was my project.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.026
And what happened?

31:34.126 --> 31:36.295
All the early trials
were on target.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.763
Excitement in the company

31:37.863 --> 31:39.398
was through the roof,
and then...

31:39.498 --> 31:41.467
You turned up problems.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.535
A neuro ADR side effect

31:43.635 --> 31:46.805
that could cause
a dissociative blackout

31:46.973 --> 31:49.808
in a... in a rare

31:49.976 --> 31:51.377
subset of participants.

31:51.477 --> 31:54.981
The risk was tiny,
but it existed.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.548
I asked for
another trial

31:56.648 --> 31:59.151
before we took the drug
to FDA, but, uh...

31:59.251 --> 32:01.520
But Volthrupp didn't want
that to happen.

32:02.989 --> 32:06.192
They decided
the risks were "acceptable."

32:07.593 --> 32:11.463
Dr. Smith, my client is
one of that rare subset,

32:11.563 --> 32:14.333
and she is now on trial
for attempted murder.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.469
Would you consider
testifying tomorrow...

32:17.569 --> 32:19.205
I-I signed an NDA.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.540
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.376
A court cannot enforce an NDA
if it violates state law.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.845
If Volthrupp is
knowingly selling drugs

32:27.013 --> 32:28.547
with adverse effects

32:28.647 --> 32:31.083
without disclosing
them to the public,

32:31.183 --> 32:33.319
you're safe.

32:34.420 --> 32:38.224
Dr. Smith, please come
to court tomorrow,

32:38.324 --> 32:40.026
sober,

32:40.026 --> 32:42.461
and testify on our behalf.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.366
Okay.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.668
Excellent.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.571
Todd, period.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.075
Court starts
in three minutes, period.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.876
Where are you, question mark?

32:58.044 --> 32:59.478
This cannot be...

32:59.578 --> 33:01.047
Wait, what happened?

33:01.147 --> 33:03.082
I'm gonna say about a half
a fifth of vodka happened.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.550
Oh!
I ran him through a
shower, poured some coffee

33:04.650 --> 33:06.652
down his throat.
I mean, what do we do?

33:06.752 --> 33:07.886
Boatman.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.855
Margaret.

33:09.955 --> 33:12.358
We proceed.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.628
And you identified a set
of neuro ADR side effects,

33:16.728 --> 33:18.097
is that correct,
Dr. Smith?

33:18.197 --> 33:19.831
Yup.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.068
And-and what

33:22.168 --> 33:24.070
were the effects caused by these

33:24.170 --> 33:26.938
adverse drug reactions
in a subset of participants?

33:27.073 --> 33:28.507
They blacked out.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.442
Yes, blackout. Um, and-and

33:30.542 --> 33:32.911
did any of the participants

33:33.079 --> 33:36.182
have violent episodes
during their blackouts?

33:36.282 --> 33:37.883
Oh, yeah.
One of them

33:37.983 --> 33:39.085
came after me with a...

33:39.085 --> 33:42.488
What's... What's it,
when stab... mail...

33:42.588 --> 33:44.523
Uh, uh, a letter opener?

33:44.623 --> 33:46.992
That's the one. Ha, ha.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.097
So, one of your patients,

33:51.097 --> 33:53.332
in a dissociative blackout,

33:53.432 --> 33:55.234
took a letter opener--

33:55.334 --> 33:59.238
which is in the shape of a
knife-- and used it as a weapon

33:59.338 --> 34:01.107
to harm you, correct?

34:01.207 --> 34:04.343
But they were real sorry after.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.445
They didn't even know.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.514
Ah.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.816
They didn't even know.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.122
Your witness.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.126
Mr. Smith, you...
It's Dr. Smith.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.960
Noted.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.863
Dr. Smith, you were fired
from Volthrupp

34:24.963 --> 34:26.732
in the middle of Orcholax's
test phases, weren't you?

34:26.832 --> 34:30.136
Yup. Right in the middle.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.037
And you were fired
from lots of other jobs

34:32.138 --> 34:33.472
after that, weren't you?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.541
Objection.
Relevance.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.742
Well, this gentleman
is being offered

34:36.842 --> 34:39.010
as an expert
in his field, Your Honor.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.479
Overruled.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.715
Mostly, I was fired

34:43.815 --> 34:47.519
'cause the companies
wanted the big money,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.155
not the truth.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.956
Wouldn't you say you were
fired because you're a drunk?

34:51.056 --> 34:52.958
Objection.
Inflammatory.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.595
Would you submit to a blood
alcohol level test, right now?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.530
Dr. Smith is not
on trial here.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.432
The man, the doctor,

35:00.532 --> 35:02.368
is flat out drunk
on the witness stand.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.337
I submit that Dr. Smith
has been fully impeached,

35:05.437 --> 35:06.772
and as such, his testimony

35:06.872 --> 35:07.839
should be stricken
from the record.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.408
Well, just because

35:09.508 --> 35:11.777
he's a little
bit impaired...
A little bit?

35:12.711 --> 35:15.347
I'm inclined to side
with Mr. Boatman.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.848
Uh, uh, redirect, Your Honor,

35:16.948 --> 35:19.251
before you make that decision?

35:26.325 --> 35:28.727
Dr. Smith,

35:28.827 --> 35:30.296
when did you start drinking?

35:30.396 --> 35:32.264
6:30 this morning.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.235
No,

35:36.335 --> 35:38.937
I meant... in your life.

35:39.037 --> 35:42.040
When did you start
drinking in your life?

35:46.212 --> 35:47.913
When Volthrupp

35:48.013 --> 35:50.916
started suppressing my results.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.118
Uh-huh.

35:53.219 --> 35:57.956
And what did
Volthrupp do to you?

35:58.056 --> 35:59.625
Pushed me
to do the opposite

35:59.725 --> 36:02.594
of what a doctor's
supposed to do.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.396
Hide results,

36:04.496 --> 36:06.598
and hurt people.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.600
When I said, "No..."

36:10.236 --> 36:11.903
...they fired me.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.506
They fired you.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.075
And how did that make you feel?

36:17.243 --> 36:18.744
I'm, uh...

36:18.844 --> 36:21.079
I'm sad.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.251
I failed people.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.388
Bad things were gonna happen
'cause of my drug...

36:30.489 --> 36:34.360
...and they wouldn't
let me tell anybody.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.701
Dr. Smith's testimony stays in.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.973
The defense rests.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.109
<i>In the matter of the attempted</i>

36:51.277 --> 36:53.279
murder of
Josephine Velez...

36:54.613 --> 36:57.082
...how does
the jury find?

36:58.149 --> 37:01.487
We find
the defendant...

37:01.587 --> 37:02.821
not guilty.

37:07.859 --> 37:12.097
I... I can't thank you enough

37:12.197 --> 37:13.765
for believing in me

37:13.865 --> 37:15.867
and for convincing the jury

37:15.967 --> 37:17.936
that that isn't who I am.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.906
I always believed in you.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.108
Thank you.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.614
Ah, and Boatman,

37:28.714 --> 37:32.217
I'm happy to give you every
piece of evidence that I have,

37:32.318 --> 37:33.652
should you want
to build a case

37:33.752 --> 37:35.086
against Volthrupp.

37:35.186 --> 37:36.522
And once we convict,

37:36.622 --> 37:39.658
you'll start up a nice,
juicy class action?

37:39.758 --> 37:40.826
And the woman behind me

37:40.926 --> 37:42.694
will be the first
plaintiff in line.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.331
Send over the files.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.766
Who would have thought

37:47.866 --> 37:49.100
that this
little case that could

37:49.200 --> 37:51.637
would lead to taking
down Big Pharma?

37:51.737 --> 37:52.738
Not you.

37:54.072 --> 37:57.008
Ah. Beautiful.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.346
Oh.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.747
I'm here,
sorry I'm late.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.415
Are you ready?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.117
Yeah, um...

38:06.217 --> 38:07.653
Mom, listen, the letter...

38:07.753 --> 38:09.355
I just, um, I couldn't.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.357
I ju... I-I couldn't,

38:11.457 --> 38:13.158
so I just need you
to tell me what to say.

38:14.192 --> 38:17.128
Oh, so now you do need my help.

38:17.228 --> 38:19.365
Can you, please, just...
It's okay.

38:19.365 --> 38:23.068
I actually did write
a letter for you...

38:24.370 --> 38:26.805
...pointing out...

38:26.905 --> 38:29.074
...that you
are a doctor,

38:29.174 --> 38:31.076
and that you
help people,

38:31.176 --> 38:32.911
and that this event

38:33.011 --> 38:34.946
was a deviation
from the norm.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.115
And...

38:38.917 --> 38:40.386
...something about
how your parents

38:40.386 --> 38:42.421
had very high
expectations for you,

38:42.521 --> 38:44.022
and perhaps

38:44.122 --> 38:46.692
pushed you a bit too hard,

38:46.792 --> 38:49.695
and, in hindsight, regret it.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.664
This sounds like an apology.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.401
That's because it is.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.437
No, no, no. No.

38:58.537 --> 39:01.873
Allison, you
shouldn't go in there

39:01.973 --> 39:04.275
and read
what I wrote.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.311
Isn't that part of the problem?

39:06.412 --> 39:08.046
Isn't that what got us here

39:08.146 --> 39:09.214
in the first place?
What?

39:09.314 --> 39:11.617
Mom, don't rip up...
No, Allison.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.218
It will be fine.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.886
Sweetheart.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.255
You don't need my help.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.458
Allison.

39:19.558 --> 39:23.429
You should go in there
and speak for yourself.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.965
Be yourself.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.535
I'll be right there.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.437
Thank you.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.439
<i>Your Honor,</i>

39:33.539 --> 39:36.442
my client would like
to address the court first.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.878
Uh, thank you,
Your Honor.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.580
I don't quite know what to say.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.348
I, um...

39:43.449 --> 39:45.884
I'm a doctor...

39:45.984 --> 39:47.753
...not that that matters.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.455
But, um...

39:49.555 --> 39:51.723
Well, it kind of matters
because I think

39:51.823 --> 39:53.191
it speaks to my character

39:53.291 --> 39:56.327
that I've made it
my life's work to help people.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.197
But, uh, sorry.
I, um...

39:59.297 --> 40:02.601
I do regret,
very deeply, what happened.

40:02.701 --> 40:06.938
I've never done anything
like that... before.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.274
It was me coloring
outside the lines,

40:09.374 --> 40:12.210
and it went wrong.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.213
I, um...

40:16.515 --> 40:17.816
I don't ever act out.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.686
Not when I'm angry,
not when I'm sad,

40:20.786 --> 40:22.688
not even...

40:22.788 --> 40:24.756
when my dad died...

40:29.461 --> 40:30.762
...when I was 19,

40:30.862 --> 40:33.865
and, you know what,
maybe I should have.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.667
Um...

40:38.403 --> 40:40.839
But, in any event...

40:42.741 --> 40:45.911
I would like to express my...

40:46.011 --> 40:48.113
deep embarrassment and regret

40:48.213 --> 40:49.681
regarding my behavior
that night.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.317
It was a mistake,

40:52.417 --> 40:54.385
and I take responsibility

40:54.486 --> 40:57.255
for my actions.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.290
And...

41:00.291 --> 41:02.160
I would like for you to consider

41:02.260 --> 41:05.564
this honest plea for forgiveness

41:05.664 --> 41:07.332
when considering my sentence.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.101
I hope all of
this sounds like

41:10.201 --> 41:11.302
an apology, because...

41:11.402 --> 41:13.939
it is one.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.676
And how do you plead?

41:17.776 --> 41:21.547
Guilty, Your Honor.
I plead guilty.

41:21.547 --> 41:25.951
I hereby sentence you,
Dr. Allison Grant...

41:27.586 --> 41:30.021
...to 200 hours
community service.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.156
Thank you.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.605
Hi.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.607
Thanks for being here.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.112
This is weird.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.414
To be the responsible one,
to be the reliable one.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.249
Oh, well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.585
I'm just saying,
I'm the good child.

41:59.685 --> 42:00.886
This is what it's like.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.254
I'll give you 72 hours
till you screw it up.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.456
Oh, so Allison's allowed
a departure from the norm

42:05.591 --> 42:06.491
but I'm not?

42:06.592 --> 42:07.593
Well, for Allison,

42:07.693 --> 42:08.694
misbehaving is
the departure.

42:08.794 --> 42:10.829
For you,
it's the norm.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.099
I am sorry, however,
that I assumed

42:14.199 --> 42:16.602
you were
the one arrested.
Yeah, thank you.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.203
Trust me, I'm not getting
collared for some simple

42:18.303 --> 42:19.404
drunk and
disorderly charge.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.839
The next time
I get arrested,

42:20.939 --> 42:22.608
it's gonna be for
something legit... Oh.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.875
...like stealing a boat
or going full vigilante

42:23.975 --> 42:25.611
on some jewel thief.
Right, yes.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.779
Um, I am no longer
representing you in court.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.380
What? No, you can't
get out of it.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.649
You're my mom.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.050
I have you on
permanent retainer.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.451
Oh, you do?

42:33.619 --> 42:34.786
Well, about that,

42:34.886 --> 42:37.455
my price just went up
after this case,

42:37.623 --> 42:39.891
and you can
no longer afford me.

42:41.026 --> 42:44.763
Well, joke's on you.
I could never afford you.
