<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.790
I'm here to talk about Haley
and her music, not Haley and me.

00:05.880 --> 00:06.949
They're the same thing.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.350
I think you're just a lying junkie
who probably doesn't even have cancer.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.988
- Just get out, Ellie.
- Okay.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.071
You're gonna need a bigger sign.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.390
Here's how the Fantasy Boy Draft works.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.550
Once you pick a guy,
he is yours for the season

00:23.640 --> 00:26.871
which means he's off the market
and no one else can touch him.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.439
Got it, Bevin?

00:28.800 --> 00:31.553
P. Sawyer, you've got the first pick
and you are on the clock.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.789
Mouth McFadden.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.995
I pick Chris Keller.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.834
- Chris goes to Brooke.
- Bevin, you're next.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.478
- Actually...
- There's been a trade.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.357
- What?
- And I pick Lucas.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.112
- Lucas Scott to Rachel.
- But she can't...

00:42.200 --> 00:43.918
- I pick Nathan.
- Nathan Scott to Haley.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.115
- Wait!
- I get Skills.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.599
- Skills to Bevin.
- Wait!

00:46.680 --> 00:48.636
This is awesome.
We all got who we wanted.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.472
Great idea, Brooke.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.799
Good morning, babe.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.199
Morning, baby.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.519
Bad dream?

02:13.440 --> 02:16.512
I dreamt that Lucas was in bed
with Chris Keller.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.118
That's pretty bad.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.595
- So, you want to make out?
- Okay, sure.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.156
Oh, hey, what did Lucas say
about you not picking him for the draft?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.514
Not much.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.353
Mostly 'cause I haven't told him yet.
You didn't say anything, did you?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.759
- No, I haven't said a word.
- Okay, good.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.871
But did I mention that my designs
were a total hit

02:47.760 --> 02:49.671
with the corporate big stuffs
over at Suburban Filth?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.512
They might pick them up for a fashion line.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.436
Oh, my God, Brooke, that's incredible.
You must be so happy or not.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.319
What is she doing talking to that troll?

02:58.760 --> 03:00.955
By "troll," do you mean Peyton?

03:01.640 --> 03:04.518
Hi, backstabbing,
supposed-to-be best friend and all.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.228
Hi, forgot-to-say-good-morning,
sneery, grouch-a-lot.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.915
I am out of here,
over-possessive best friends

03:11.760 --> 03:14.433
with weird lesbian energy. And Haley.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.678
Play us or trade us.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.634
- What are you babbling about?
- The Boy Draft.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.991
We know all you girls got together
and drafted us to be your little love dolls,

03:21.520 --> 03:23.795
so, we just want to know the results.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.955
It was a fantasy draft, Dim.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.516
You know, like the fantasies
you have about Nathan, not real.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.069
- What'd you have in mind?
- Dates. Tonight. You pay.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.030
- Look...
- Okay, sounds good.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.589
- Sweet.
- I'm gonna go get Skills.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.117
So, who picked me?
Come on, who wants some Tim?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.118
Is it you, Brooke?

03:47.320 --> 03:51.757
You didn't even get drafted,
you little Tim.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.669
- Hey, are you okay with this?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

03:59.480 --> 04:03.439
- I mean, it's a group thing, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.272
- You wanna come by at like, 8:00?
- Okay.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.875
Okay.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.756
- Hey, Brooke.
- Hey, look who it is.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.789
So, what time should I be ready?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.560
You know, it's the craziest thing.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.878
- I sort of got mixed up and didn't pick you.
- What?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.516
It was all Rachel's fault. She tricked me.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.118
So, let me get this straight.
You could have picked me, but you didn't?

04:32.120 --> 04:34.190
It just sort of happened wrong.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.109
She picked Chris Keller and I picked you.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.233
Well, at least somebody wanted me.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.875
No.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.919
Hey, boyfriend.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.038
Looks like we're supposed to go out
on a date tonight.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.711
I know you were just doing me a favor
when you drafted me, Peyton.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.112
But there's something
I have to do tonight.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.194
You're a tough guy to ask out, Mouth.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.113
Well, you could come if you want.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.758
It's just kind of uncool.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.875
Okay, trust me, I've had enough
supposedly cool nights.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.154
- Uncool sounds great.
- Okay, uncool it is.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.993
I can't believe I didn't even get drafted.

05:28.520 --> 05:32.718
So, Dan put up another campaign billboard
over the highway just outside of town.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.751
Yeah, I know, I saw it.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.476
But if he's gonna buy the election,
there's really nothing I can do about it.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.196
Actually, there is.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.558
Have I ever told you
how ridiculous Dan looks

05:50.520 --> 05:52.158
with a mustache?

05:53.800 --> 05:54.869
What do you think?

06:02.840 --> 06:05.354
The same thing I thought 10 seconds ago.
You look great.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.752
Okay, well, I'm sorry if I'm a little nervous.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.319
I just have the perfect evening planned
for Nathan and me.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.635
I cannot believe you're not going
on your date, by the way.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.629
I don't know, you can pick between
this whole thing was your idea

06:13.520 --> 06:17.911
or because you physically threatened
every person that didn't follow the rules.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.799
Shoot, that's Nathan. I'm not ready.
Where are my shoes?

06:17.560 --> 06:18.993
On your feet.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.678
To finish our conversation,

06:24.840 --> 06:27.638
I would rather tongue kiss
a pus-infected sore

06:26.640 --> 06:29.552
than ever go out with Chris...

06:28.880 --> 06:32.429
Well, well, my date's already
dressed for bed.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.229
Looks like someone's a little horny
for some Chris Keller.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.268
- Hey, Rachel, come on in.
- Thanks. You ready?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.632
Actually, if it's cool with you
I was gonna go see Brooke.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.193
Luke, you know I was messing
with Brooke when I drafted you, right?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.272
And anyway, doesn't she have a date
with Chris Keller?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.234
- No, she wouldn't do that.
- I don't know.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.400
I've seen the guy. He's kind of fine.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.915
Yeah, he's kind of a jerk, too.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.235
Interesting. And definitely my type.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.154
Well, I was gonna say we could get
a workout in at the river court.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.589
But, instead, let's go to Brooke's house,
and I'll officially trade you.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.749
You'd do that? You'd trade me?

07:22.120 --> 07:25.112
Yeah, why not?
I can't torture Brooke forever.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.758
Well, I could, but where's the fun in that?

07:29.600 --> 07:30.828
Come on.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.999
Look, whatever you heard,
you heard wrong.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.471
- So, you're not into me?
- No.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.435
Wait, so you and Haley
aren't going on dates?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.395
No.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.391
Hey, Nate. Here for your date?

07:47.160 --> 07:48.752
Yeah. What's it to you?

07:49.600 --> 07:53.195
Haley, your boyfriends are here!

07:52.920 --> 07:53.955
Hi.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.519
- Wow, you look so...
- Overdressed.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.314
- So, you girls ready?
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.598
Fine by me. I'm good staying in.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.474
Well, we're going out.
Let me just get my purse.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.070
Actually, maybe Brooke's right.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.431
I mean, if she's not gonna
follow through with this,

08:15.320 --> 08:17.675
what are the odds anyone else is?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.958
Could you just... Just one second.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.037
- That hurts.
- Okay, listen, sister,

08:22.160 --> 08:24.151
I joined cheerleading
and I stayed in this stupid draft

08:25.600 --> 08:26.874
because of who? You.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.510
Now, I am this close to getting
an actual date with Nathan,

08:32.240 --> 08:34.515
so, if you don't suck it up
and go out with Chris Keller,

08:34.320 --> 08:37.198
I swear, the only pus-infected sores
you're gonna be licking are your own

08:35.679 --> 08:37.113
when I get through with you.
Do you get it?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.116
Okay, great. We're going.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.352
Yeah, Brooke's definitely
staying home tonight.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.276
That's Chris Keller, right?

08:44.840 --> 08:47.559
We could probably get some beer
before that workout, huh?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.990
Now you're talking. Let's go.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.833
- First-round draft pick reporting for duty.
- Hey, Skills, come on in.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.440
Oh, yeah. This'll do.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.079
My parents are out of town for the night.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.118
So, I was thinking we'd stay in
and watch a movie,

09:23.960 --> 09:26.713
maybe have a couple drinks. Is that okay?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.318
Okay? It's better than okay, ma.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.796
- This is perfect.
- Thanks.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.749
So, anyways, I was thinking
we could watch <i>The Notebook.</i>

09:36.240 --> 09:40.472
How about I just watch you
and you can watch whatever it's called.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.790
<i>The Notebook.</i>
Oh, my God, you haven't seen it?

09:42.280 --> 09:45.431
It's only, like, the best movie ever.
Trust me.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.390
- All right, whatever you say, Devin.
- Bevin.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.316
Yeah. Yeah, that, too.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.433
I've got to hand it to you, Mouth.
I've been on some kinky dates before,

09:57.760 --> 10:00.069
but no one has ever brought me
to an old folks' home.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.871
- You've been on kinky dates?
- Okay, not the point.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.633
- What are we doing here?
- This is the thing I had to do.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.952
- I come once a week and I read to Mel.
- Oh. Wait, who's Mel?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.588
<i>All right. I'll just...</i>

10:13.440 --> 10:15.670
<i>The first time I met Ron,</i>
<i>when he asked me to...</i>

10:16.360 --> 10:19.477
- Hey, Mel.
- Oh, hi, Joe.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.599
No, it's me, Marvin, Mouth.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.716
Oh, sure, Mouse. Come in, come in.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.990
I brought you the sports page.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.558
Well, what do we have here?

10:34.040 --> 10:36.793
We have a Peyton. Hi.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.553
- Peyton. That's a pretty name.
- Well, you're not so bad yourself.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.950
Come in. Sit down, sit down.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.752
Thank you.
You've got a really great place here.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.193
Not really. It smells like old people.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.678
Take a look at this.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.394
Did I ever tell you that I used to race cars?

11:00.480 --> 11:03.438
Well, you were a handsome devil.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.234
They called me Fireball.
I was kind of fast with the ladies.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.796
I've got some more pictures
around here somewhere.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.555
Okay.

11:14.960 --> 11:19.033
All right, I have an idea. Let's spring him.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.113
- What?
- Just for the night.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.440
- This place is depressing, Mouth.
- Peyton, we can't.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.679
Hey, Fireball.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.509
How would you like to do a little driving
with us tonight?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.995
Young lady, I'd rob a bank for you
if you asked me nicely.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.952
Come on, Mouth. It's just a couple hours.
What harm could it do?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.796
I don't know, Peyton. A lot.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.073
Joey, if you blow this for me,
I'm gonna beat you to death

11:43.320 --> 11:45.231
with this helmet, okay?

11:46.320 --> 11:49.392
Okay, let's go. Ladies first.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.155
Am I the only one that doesn't get
the whole beach thing?

11:51.640 --> 11:53.870
It's the beach. What is there to get?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.994
Yeah, but it's such a big tease.
I mean, think about it.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.313
Girls strip down. Sometimes they go
topless, but never nude.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.276
You can't touch them. It's like a strip club.
Hey, babe.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.675
- So, what are we doing here anyway?
- This is where we got married.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.116
- I thought we'd be alone.
- You guys got married here?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.914
It wasn't exactly here.
It was just over this ridge.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.832
It's so beautiful.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.955
I'm telling you, it is completely untouched.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.998
It's like paradise.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.438
It's gone.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.109
Paradise gone. Seems appropriate.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.437
There were all these little,
purple wildflowers and trees.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.199
It's okay.
Come on, let's just go to the mall.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.190
- Ready?
- Deb, I don't think we should.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.276
- What if we get caught?
- Karen, quit being so responsible.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.955
I can't help it. That's who I am.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.035
Well, not according to
Dan's campaign commercial.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.549
You know, the one that
makes you look psychotic?

13:25.520 --> 13:26.999
Besides, it's harmless fun.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.838
We'll paint a mustache on him,
some black teeth.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.754
- You said you wanted to do this.
- Yeah.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.157
That's when I was stuck in construction
traffic staring at his fat face.

13:34.280 --> 13:38.034
- Now I'm chicken.
- Fine, but I'm going up.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.719
And tomorrow
when you're stuck in traffic,

13:39.840 --> 13:41.876
you're gonna wish you'd joined me.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.394
Fine.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.310
I can't believe I'm doing this.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.995
I can't believe she's doing this.

13:52.840 --> 13:56.116
So, she's on a date with Chris.
It doesn't mean anything.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.278
No, it does.
This guy's caused a lot of trouble.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.398
Brooke knows that.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.796
Okay, so, what is the deal
with you and Brooke anyway?

14:06.720 --> 14:09.314
- She's just not ready to commit.
- Right.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.911
That's usually what I tell guys
I'm not really into.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.878
And she wants to make sure
I'm serious about her. You know, plus...

14:15.880 --> 14:18.838
- Plus what?
- She's the one.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.916
- Why?
- She just is.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.919
I feel it. You know, Pascal says that,
"The heart has reasons

14:25.080 --> 14:26.399
"that reason cannot know."

14:28.600 --> 14:31.194
What did Pascal say about Chris Keller?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.598
Sorry. Cheap shot.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.115
Okay, here's the game.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.390
You miss a shot and you drink.

14:43.480 --> 14:48.429
You make a shot, I drink.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.071
Okay, this was a bad idea.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.708
This was a bad idea.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.360
Oh, quit complaining and grow a pair.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.470
- You ready, Mel?
- That's Fireball to you, Trixie.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.355
Go!

15:01.640 --> 15:02.914
Here we go.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.157
You want some of this?

15:11.760 --> 15:13.398
<i>You remember me?</i>

15:12.880 --> 15:15.792
<i>Yeah, sure. Mr. Underwear, was it?</i>

15:26.400 --> 15:27.674
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>- How could I forget?</i>

15:31.040 --> 15:33.156
Are you gonna watch the movie?

15:38.280 --> 15:40.919
I would, but I can't stop watching you.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.353
Okay, here.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.798
There's more of that
if you watch the movie.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.475
Okay.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.994
Let's watch this damn movie, then.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.272
- Great.
- Go ahead. Hurry up.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.917
Go do it, and let's get out of here.
Go, go, go.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.435
Okay. Okay, you do it.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.920
- No, you said you would do it.
- Okay.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.748
Go ahead.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.715
You do the mustache. Go.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.151
Not exactly the magical night
you had planned?

16:18.920 --> 16:22.708
No, I wouldn't say that.
Crowded mall and Nathan ignoring me,

16:21.560 --> 16:24.711
Chris Keller stealing change
out of the fountain.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.710
My night with Nathan was supposed to be
a dream come true, not this nightmare.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.471
Keep the dream alive, sister.
I'll talk to Nathan.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.311
Okay, two-part question, Nate.
A: Why the hell haven't you beaten

17:07.359 --> 17:09.555
the stuffing out of Chris Keller yet,
so I can go home?

17:11.640 --> 17:15.838
And B: If you were just gonna ignore Haley
all night, why did you come?

17:17.160 --> 17:21.199
Haley still loves you.
All you have to do is take her back.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.479
Right. Kind of like with you and Lucas.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.116
You see, it's not so easy
getting back in the ring,

17:34.280 --> 17:37.989
especially with the one that
knocked you out in the first place.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.234
Well, well, Haley James.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.270
- What did you wish for?
- That Nathan would bludgeon you.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.313
Brooke and I were actually kind
of wondering why he hasn't already.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.716
Maybe he's afraid of me.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.552
Or maybe he doesn't care anymore.
Let's find out.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.755
Hey, stop it.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.318
Come on, either he gets jealous,
or me, you and Brooke have a threesome.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.477
- Either way, it's win-win for you.
- Chris, seriously, don't.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.117
What the hell is this?

18:17.720 --> 18:20.757
- Good news for you, bad news for me.
- I told him not to.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.309
You better back off, Keller.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.076
Hey, I just thought someone
should be nice to her tonight.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.275
Oh, yeah?

18:28.280 --> 18:30.555
Haley, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

18:31.400 --> 18:34.551
Nathan is vulnerable and you were
practically giving the enemy a lap dance.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.959
I didn't do anything.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.149
You mean, besides kiss Chris
and run away with him?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.199
You know what? I'm out of here.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.710
This whole thing has gotten
way beyond the point of bizarre.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.755
Oh, you mean bizarre,
like messing with Lucas

18:42.880 --> 18:44.632
and then hiding all those letters
under your bed?

18:45.360 --> 18:46.793
Wait. Check it out, catfight.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.513
What were you doing
snooping through my things?

18:50.320 --> 18:51.639
I wasn't snooping through your things.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.511
I bumped into them
when I was trying to maximize

18:54.520 --> 18:58.229
on the two feet of storage space that
you so generously offered to me.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.190
Oh, you know what? I'm done.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.313
Brooke, wait!

19:00.280 --> 19:02.669
There is no way that
you get to waltz out of here

19:02.200 --> 19:04.589
when this whole stupid night
was your idea.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.672
- Brooke, don't go.
- Come here, Keller.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.275
- I am not through with you.
- Yeah, well, I'm through with you.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.714
Come on, Brooke, the night's still young.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.877
And the night's gonna be over
if you touch Haley again.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.789
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.309
My clothes.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.830
Have you not spent enough rent money
for tonight, Brooke?

19:21.880 --> 19:24.838
No, these are my designs, my sketches.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.149
They told me to draw up some things.
They said they liked them,

19:26.520 --> 19:29.478
but I guess... I just never dreamed.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.875
You guys, I'm in the window.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.788
Okay, how cool is this?
Now we have to celebrate, right?

19:33.360 --> 19:35.032
No doubt about it.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.159
We're stuck.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.189
Well,

19:42.360 --> 19:46.319
he's probably gonna ground me,
but I'll call Lucas on the phone.

19:55.880 --> 20:00.510
- Which I left next to yours in the car.
- Oh, no.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.276
- Help! Help!
- Deb.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.914
- Deb, you cannot do that.
- Why not? We're stuck.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.517
Because we're gonna look like
a couple of jackholes

20:07.880 --> 20:10.394
and Dan will win the election for sure.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.715
Besides, they've closed
the highway at night

20:18.960 --> 20:22.111
because of the construction,
so no one's gonna hear you.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.357
I'm sorry, Karen.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.158
This is my fault.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.669
Now, look, I wanted to come.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.550
No, I mean all of it.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.240
I never should have agreed to stay
with Dan during this race.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.596
I just... I wanted so badly to believe that
he'd actually leave Nathan alone

20:38.880 --> 20:41.678
even though I know it's probably a lie.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.398
- Got to get out of that house, Deb.
- I know.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.951
I guess I'm just afraid to be on my own.
Always been that way.

20:48.120 --> 20:52.079
You're not gonna be alone, Deb.
You're gonna be independent.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.039
And although you might not see it
in yourself,

20:57.280 --> 20:59.953
I see that strength in you every day.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.988
Thanks.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.039
Stupid ladder.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.989
- Okay, I've got an idea.
- What?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.116
- We're getting down.
- How?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.677
Take off your clothes.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.669
Huh?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.833
You're a good guy, Mouth.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.116
It's really nice of you to spend time
with Mel.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.629
It says a lot about you.
I bet you're gonna have it all some day.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.153
Yeah, I'm thinking of running for senator.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.068
I got the idea from Brooke. Sort of.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.918
Old Fireball's on a tear.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.913
I bet this is a night he won't forget
for a while.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.599
Actually, he probably won't remember it.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.354
Mel has Alzheimer's disease, Peyton.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.600
He's forgotten huge parts of his life.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.276
He was married for 50 years,
but he doesn't remember it.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.434
His mind just opened up over time
and everything slipped away.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.352
The woman he loved,
the house he lived in...

22:10.920 --> 22:12.239
His youth.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.513
- We should probably take him back.
- Okay.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.070
<i>Something inside Noah snapped.</i>

22:22.400 --> 22:24.311
Wait, he's building that house
and he don't even know

22:25.560 --> 22:27.039
if she coming back?

22:34.800 --> 22:38.429
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.717
Yeah, you write those letters, dawg.
Write them.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.718
So, what about the letters to Lucas?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.671
Are we talking about me
or celebrating me?

22:51.600 --> 22:55.115
Oh, no, we are definitely celebrating you.
To your sketches.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.357
We already drank to that like 20 times.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.278
No, we drank to your designs
like 20 times.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.592
Then we drank to your clothes.
Now we're drinking to your sketches,

23:09.680 --> 23:11.875
in the window, totally yours.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.838
To my sketches.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.991
Any meteors up there?

23:18.640 --> 23:23.236
That was a great night. Remember that?
Watching the meteor shower together.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.518
- You look nice tonight, Haley.
- Thanks.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.477
I just wish we could have spent
some more time together without all this.

23:29.680 --> 23:33.559
- Chris and Brooke?
- I mean the beach, this balcony.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.395
I haven't forgotten about our past, Haley.
I know where we got married.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.034
I know this is where
we made love in the rain.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.514
I still feel our past just like you do.

23:46.120 --> 23:50.398
I just thought it might be nice
to hang out in the present for a night.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.957
What are you thinking?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.148
Nothing.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.591
Just praying for rain.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.709
Well, that's the last of it.
Nice shooting, Tex.

24:10.760 --> 24:14.070
- So, are we gonna call it a night?
- Or we could play a new game.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.872
How about strip basketball?

24:17.240 --> 24:19.117
You know,
I always figured if I met the devil

24:25.160 --> 24:27.754
that she'd be hot and holding a basketball.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.159
- But I'm gonna pass.
- Because of Brooke, who's on a date?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.830
Okay, take your shirt off.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.349
Rachel.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.595
I'm not gonna touch you,
you sissy virgin boy.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.237
I'm trying to make a point.
Take your shirt off.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.558
All right, you say Brooke's the one,
your soul mate.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.876
Well, if that's the case

24:50.000 --> 24:53.913
call upon destiny or providence

24:52.440 --> 24:55.671
or whatever forces are gonna
bring you two together

25:01.080 --> 25:04.356
and make the shot blindfolded.

25:06.680 --> 25:10.389
- This is ridiculous.
- Come on, it's your destiny.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.873
You can't miss.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.110
- Okay. Can you see me?
- No.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.477
Okay. I trust you.

25:27.480 --> 25:31.758
Now follow my voice.
If Brooke's the one, make the shot.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.750
- What happened?
- It went in.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.913
Nice shot.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.678
Make it, take it.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.916
Get yourself dressed, Rachel.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.995
Okay, that's the second time this month
you've said that to me.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.158
- You're gonna give me a complex.
- Come on.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.316
- Why sell yourself short like this, huh?
- You guys are unbelievable.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.832
We don't give it up, you pressure us.

26:25.120 --> 26:29.272
We do give it up and we have
self-image problems or we're sluts.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.599
You know, at my last school,
we had names for guys like you, Luke.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.509
"Gay."

26:34.040 --> 26:38.272
I mean, non-exclusive dating
is a dream come true for most boys,

26:35.880 --> 26:38.440
so what's with the dorks at Tree Hill?

26:41.160 --> 26:44.516
I mean, every guy is tragically hung up
on somebody.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.908
It makes it kind of hard for a girl.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.151
Not if she's "the girl."

26:52.840 --> 26:56.276
Lucas is the one for me.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.596
Actually, my name is Chris.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.668
No, don't be like that.
Come on, let's have another beer.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.919
- To your sketches.
- That's a nice try, but you can go now.

27:06.760 --> 27:10.355
Fair enough. It's late, I'm attractive.
It scares you.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.956
Let me use the restroom.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.630
You know, I envy you, Brooke.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.396
Having found someone
to trust and confide in like Lucas,

27:21.080 --> 27:25.437
someone that won't take advantage of it.
Sort of like Haley found Nathan.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.399
I'm sure it'll work out for them, too.

27:28.200 --> 27:32.193
I just wanted you to know that
I don't blame you for any of this.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.515
You didn't want to get married.

27:34.760 --> 27:39.038
Wait a second. Of course I did.
I was just scared.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.589
Yeah, and I promised you
everything would be okay.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.078
I shouldn't have.
I think about it a lot, you know,

27:51.680 --> 27:54.592
how this isn't the life you would have had
if I hadn't come along.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.271
- It's not the life you should have had.
- It's more.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.790
No, it's not. You'd still have your music.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.594
You'd be on tour.
You'd probably be a big star by now.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.671
Oh, come on. You're...

28:09.840 --> 28:10.955
Okay.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.639
You know the moment that I left the tour?

28:14.160 --> 28:17.152
We were playing this club in Illinois,
and Chris decides

28:16.680 --> 28:19.831
to do a cover of an '80s song
called <i>Missing You.</i>

28:21.200 --> 28:24.351
And everybody starts singing along.
The crowd's loving it

28:23.040 --> 28:25.429
and they turn the house lights up.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.276
And I could see every face out there

28:29.000 --> 28:31.560
and I fell apart.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.198
Onstage in front of 3,000 people, I lost it.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.790
I couldn't sing,
I couldn't hear the music, nothing.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.272
'Cause that was the moment that I knew

28:44.440 --> 28:47.591
that none of it could ever be enough
without you.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.311
All of the celebrity and all of the applause

28:51.440 --> 28:55.718
and all the pretty melodies
couldn't fill your void in my heart.

28:56.200 --> 29:00.557
So, yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not the life I would have had,

28:59.760 --> 29:03.196
'cause ever since I met you,
it has been so much more.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.870
There's no chance that you'd want to go

29:05.800 --> 29:08.314
to the last place I had planned for us,
is there?

29:12.840 --> 29:15.195
Well, let's see,
it's either take my chances with you

29:18.680 --> 29:21.956
- or hang out with Chris Keller.
- Thank you. Let's go.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.235
Did you like the movie, Skills?

29:28.120 --> 29:32.796
There's just so much love.
Just so much love.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.349
It's okay.
That's just the power of <i>The Notebook.</i>

29:33.160 --> 29:35.116
Do you want me to drive you home?

29:43.600 --> 29:47.388
Or we could go upstairs and make out.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.753
- Can we cuddle a little first?
- Sure.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.991
All right, here it goes.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.356
Shoot. We're just a little short.

29:58.360 --> 30:02.478
- Okay, we're gonna need more clothes.
- Yeah, well, forget it, Annie Oakley.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.908
I already gave you my jacket
and my shoes

30:12.960 --> 30:14.439
and I made a promise to myself that

30:18.080 --> 30:21.231
I would never be naked
in front of that man again.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.839
- The things I do for you.
- Keep your pants on.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.548
That's pretty cute. Where'd you get that?

30:27.640 --> 30:30.996
Didn't I tell you? There was a sale at...
Would you just tie it on?

30:29.200 --> 30:30.189
Oh, okay.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.752
Here we go. Come on.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.839
Come on. Come on. Come on.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.751
- Okay. Ready?
- Come on.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.509
And...

30:54.680 --> 30:55.874
We got it!

30:56.720 --> 30:59.757
Easy. Easy.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.395
Yeah!

31:00.480 --> 31:01.799
All right. Okay.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.875
Get dressed and I'll gather up
all the evidence.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.953
- Let's get the heck off this thing.
- Right.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.909
I don't want to leave it like this, Deb.

31:13.800 --> 31:18.351
We're better than this, Deb.
I don't want to sink to Dan's level.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.272
You could have said that
before we climbed up here.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.595
Yeah, well,

31:27.680 --> 31:29.875
what fun would that have been?

31:30.080 --> 31:31.957
Okay, Mel, you're home.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.153
Oh, hey, wait!

31:37.960 --> 31:40.349
Don't forget your helmet, Fireball.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.197
Thank you, sweetheart.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.436
What's your name, anyway?

31:59.560 --> 32:04.031
- It's Peyton.
- Peyton. That's a pretty name.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.713
Did I ever tell you I used to race cars?

32:06.760 --> 32:09.069
No, no, you never told me that.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.078
I bet you were great.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.597
Take your time, Joe.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.232
He deserves better.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.397
- How long have you known him?
- All my life.

32:27.360 --> 32:31.114
He's my grandpa.
He just doesn't remember.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.314
You know how he's always
calling me Joe?

32:46.760 --> 32:50.150
Well, Joe's my dad's name,
but they had a falling out,

32:53.400 --> 32:56.073
and so I come to see him instead.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.636
Anyway, I'll be back.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.558
Okay, here we are.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.517
You're probably tired,
so I'll see you next week.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.349
Joe,

33:11.840 --> 33:15.549
I know I made some mistakes with you,

33:16.680 --> 33:19.831
but one day you're gonna have
a boy of your own.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.116
Make sure he's a good man.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.028
I will.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.393
I love you.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.312
I love you too, Son.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.598
- You all set?
- Yeah.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.195
Hey, Mouth, can I ask you a question?

33:52.960 --> 33:56.236
Why do you keep coming to see him
if he's just not gonna remember?

33:58.480 --> 33:59.959
Because I will.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.350
Besides, he probably doesn't have
that much time left and...

34:21.679 --> 34:24.752
I don't know. Nobody should die alone.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.677
This bracelet, it's like my birth mother's.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.395
It's a cancer-survivor bracelet.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.712
But I told her I didn't want to see her
anymore and I sent her away.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.748
You know, I know Alzheimer's
is this terrible disease,

34:38.920 --> 34:41.434
but at least Mel doesn't have to live
with his regrets.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.830
You know, and all the mistakes he made
and stuff he wishes he could take back.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.958
Yeah, that's true.

34:52.560 --> 34:57.350
But I say give me regret as long as I can
keep the good memories, too.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.076
We all have regrets, Peyton,

35:04.400 --> 35:07.676
but some of us still have enough time
to erase them.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.309
I thought you were dragging me out here
to play miniature golf.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.675
- What happened?
- No, no, that's gone.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.595
Kind of like our wedding site.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.236
Yeah, look, I know tonight
wasn't what you wanted it to be, Haley.

35:29.880 --> 35:33.270
No. You were right. I had some
unrealistic notions about tonight

35:40.720 --> 35:45.191
and I think I just... I had a silly idea that
everything would work out perfectly

35:43.120 --> 35:46.795
and I would end up in your arms and...
I'm sorry.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.278
I guess I just wanted to hear you say that
everything was gonna be okay

35:48.200 --> 35:50.634
even if it was just for one night.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.350
I'm sorry. Anyway, every year Lucas and I
come up here

35:55.040 --> 35:58.077
and we make predictions
about what's gonna happen

35:59.600 --> 36:02.751
or what we wish would happen
during the next school year.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.911
- And I wanna show you my prediction.
- Don't.

36:06.640 --> 36:10.872
I mean, if you show me
then it won't come true. It's a wish, right?

36:09.520 --> 36:13.479
- Please, Nathan.
- Okay, give it to me.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.392
- You got a pen?
- Of course, I have a pen. I'm Tutor Girl.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.113
- Why?
- Turn around.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.829
- What are you...
- I need your back.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.994
Okay.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.158
What are you doing?

36:41.760 --> 36:44.593
I'm writing my own prediction
for this year.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.911
A year from now, we'll see.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.830
So, what's to keep me from sneaking
up here and reading what you wrote?

36:49.880 --> 36:52.394
I guess I'll just have to trust you.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.319
Brooke's house.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.793
Honestly, Lucas,
have I taught you nothing?

36:59.440 --> 37:02.989
The end-of-the-night, drunken booty call
is the last act of a desperate boy.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.353
It's not a booty call.
It's the opposite of that.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.196
Why? Because she's the one?

37:22.680 --> 37:25.069
Do you realize how screwed up
that logic is?

37:24.640 --> 37:27.473
- I made the shot.
- So you made a lucky shot.

37:27.480 --> 37:31.951
Do you really think there's only one person
in this entire planet that's right for you?

37:31.120 --> 37:33.953
- I do.
- Okay, what about Peyton?

37:33.960 --> 37:37.157
I hear you once had the same feelings
for her. Maybe she's the one.

37:36.080 --> 37:40.437
Or being that we're still in high school,
maybe you haven't met the one.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.837
But I have. And she's in that apartment.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.313
Hey, look who it is.
How was your date with Bevin?

37:46.120 --> 37:49.317
Hey, you guys ever see a movie
called <i>The Notebook?</i>

37:49.080 --> 37:50.798
She notebooked you?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.112
He was really sweet.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.791
I totally notebooked him.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.832
Thanks for tonight.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.434
I know it's a little out of the way.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.548
Actually, I promised Lucas that
I would meet him afterwards,

38:28.200 --> 38:31.510
so we could talk about
how the dates went and stuff.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.275
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just take off.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.909
Okay.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.550
Listen, Haley, don't be worried
about the beach,

38:56.920 --> 38:58.512
our wedding spot.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.516
I know, Nathan. I'm sorry.

39:02.920 --> 39:07.550
I just hate that it's all gone, you know,
the trees and those little purple flowers...

39:06.120 --> 39:07.189
Here.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.271
The roots are still there.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.718
It just takes time.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.474
Don't say I never gave you anything.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.274
Brooke.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.629
English.
