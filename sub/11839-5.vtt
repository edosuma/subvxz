WEBVTT

00:13.547 --> 00:14.947
>> CHARLIE: That's what's
good about a beer.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.215
>> FRANK: Yeah, it's good.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.649
>> It just keeps cycling
through you...

00:17.651 --> 00:19.018
>> MAC: Guys, guys, guys, guys!
We got news.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.886
We've got terrible news.
>> DENNIS: Yeah.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.654
>> What do you got?
>> Okay, you know that Chinese

00:22.656 --> 00:24.189
fish factory across the street?
The one with the horrible smell?

00:24.191 --> 00:25.457
>> Ugh.
>> Yeah.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.192
>> DEE: Yeah. Of course.
Disgusting.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.527
>> Been there forever?
>> They've installed security

00:28.529 --> 00:29.795
cameras pointed directly at
Paddy's.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.130
>> Yeah.
>> What?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.731
>> They're pointing them at us?
>> Yes.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.633
>> They can't do that.
>> That's bullshit!

00:34.635 --> 00:36.135
What, are they spying on us?
>> Yes, dude, I think they're

00:36.137 --> 00:37.403
spying on us, and you know what
else?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.837
They bought the building next

00:38.839 --> 00:39.972
door and they are expanding
like crazy.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.540
I'm telling you, it is only a

00:41.542 --> 00:43.409
matter of time before the
Chinese take us over.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.310
>> Oh, they've always been very
secretive for a fish factory.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.079
>> And do you ever feel like
maybe they're using that fish

00:47.081 --> 00:48.580
smell to cover up, like, maybe
some other mysterious smell?

00:48.582 --> 00:50.716
>> Mmm. >> It is an incredibly
strong smell.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.251
It's turned me off of fish.
>> Me, too!

00:52.253 --> 00:53.919
>> That's so bad.
>> Oh, I'm off of fish.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.088
>> And I used to eat so much
fish, guys, I mean...

00:56.090 --> 00:57.723
>> I love fish.
>> 'Cause fish has all the

00:57.725 --> 00:59.358
good fatty acids, right?
>> A good fish, a solid fish?

00:59.360 --> 01:00.759
>> Protein, omega numbers...

01:00.761 --> 01:01.827
>> So many omegas-- threes,
fours and fives.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.028
>> Melts in your mouth.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.863
>> You get to eat all your
scales.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.331
>> Don't eat the scales.
>> No, you don't eat the scales.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.733
>> You know, you don't get

01:07.735 --> 01:09.368
scales unless it's a fish or a
reptile.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.003
You got to get them...
>> Don't eat reptiles.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.604
>> Yeah, not eating all
reptiles, just the good ones.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.840
>> Okay, guys, we got a plan.
Dee, come with us.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.842
>> Yeah. >> You're gonna help us
gather intel.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.210
>> Okay.
>> Let's do it, come on.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.745
>> There she goes.
>> Let's go.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.513
>> All right, and then, uh, what
do Frank and I do?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.215
>> Well, you guys just hang
back, uh, do your thing.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.050
Don't eat reptiles and just hang
out.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.518
>> What? >> What, you're going
with Dee over us?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.387
>> Right.
>> Yeah.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.055
>> I-Is this 'cause you guys
have been living at her place

01:30.057 --> 01:31.924
ever since your fire?
You know what I mean?

01:31.926 --> 01:33.926
I feel like you burn your place
down, you move into Dee's, and

01:33.928 --> 01:35.594
now you're, like, getting all
buddy-buddy...

01:35.596 --> 01:37.596
>> Yeah. Yeah, chummy-chummy.
>> Yeah, I-I guess so.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.364
You know, if you need.
>> That's crazy!

01:39.366 --> 01:41.700
Dee over us?
I mean, you can't count on her.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.769
You're completely unreliable,
Dee, really.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.537
You're, like, all gangly and
uncoordinated.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.072
And she's constantly gonna
back-sass you.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.041
>> Oh, she'll argue with
everything you say.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.976
>> You know, it's bullshit.
>> No, you know what's bullshit?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.911
Me getting boxed out all the
time.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.813
And these guys have finally
realized, by living with me,

01:54.815 --> 01:56.081
that old Dee is pretty cool

01:56.083 --> 01:58.083
after all, and pretty funny,
too.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.818
So maybe I shouldn't be the butt
of everybody's jokes anymore.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.587
>> Let's... let's not get crazy,
Dee.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.155
>> Yeah, you're always gonna be
the butt of our jokes.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.890
>> Whatever, let's roll.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.458
>> Yeah, we're still gonna make
jokes at your expense.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.926
>> That's okay, let's go.
>> All right.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.428
>> Yeah, uh... just hang.
Uh, we're good.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.762
>> Huh?
>> What the hell was that?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.164
>> Something stinks here,

02:12.166 --> 02:13.432
Charlie, and it ain't just the
fish.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.766
>> Dude, the other day, I was

02:14.768 --> 02:16.168
trying to get in the back
office...

02:16.170 --> 02:17.669
>> Yeah?
>> Dennis had the door locked.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.405
>> Mac locked the door, too!
>> What is that?

02:20.407 --> 02:22.407
>> Who locks the office door?
>> I feel like they're always

02:22.409 --> 02:24.476
sneaking around now, and they're
all, like, nervous.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.677
>> Something big is definitely
going down.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.112
>> I got a plan. You know what?

02:27.114 --> 02:28.814
How about you and I spy on that
Chinese factory?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.482
>> Yeah, but, Charlie, I trust

02:30.484 --> 02:32.584
the Chinese as far as I could
throw their factory.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.520
>> Mm-hmm.
>> But the real threat isn't

02:34.522 --> 02:38.357
abroad, Charlie; it's right here
at home.

02:38.359 --> 02:42.327
We got to spy on Mac and Dennis.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.024
♪ ♪

03:19.633 --> 03:20.699
(Dennis gags)

03:20.701 --> 03:23.168
>> Oh, God, that smell!
>> Whew!

03:23.170 --> 03:24.736
>> The air quality in here is
terrible!

03:24.738 --> 03:26.305
How do these people survive in
this?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.173
>> Oof.
Well, you know the Chinese.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.642
It's like, business first,
breathing second, goddamn it!

03:30.644 --> 03:33.245
At least we know that it's a
real fish factory, not some sort

03:33.247 --> 03:35.047
of a front for something.
>> Well...

03:35.049 --> 03:36.715
>> Well, Dee, we don't know that
for sure, okay?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.550
And that's why you got to get a
job here.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.385
>> I got to get a job here?
What am I looking for?

03:40.387 --> 03:41.720
>> Shady practices, you know?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.189
Sketchy dealings. Schematics.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.191
>> Uh, human rights violations,
anything, Dee.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.659
Just-just, you know, gather
intel.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.261
>> Okay.
What are you guys gonna do?

03:49.263 --> 03:51.230
>> Dee, you're on a need-to-know
basis here, okay?

03:51.232 --> 03:52.931
There's a chain of command here,
okay?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.233
You're at the very bottom.
>> You're way down.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.834
>> Yeah.
>> Well, at least tell me what

03:55.836 --> 03:57.536
the whole plan is.
>> Dee, the one time we bring

03:57.538 --> 03:59.404
you in on a thing instead of
Charlie and all we get is

03:59.406 --> 04:00.872
back-sass and questions?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.841
Do you want to be on the team or
not? >> Yeah.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.543
Yeah, I want to be part of the
team, okay?

04:04.545 --> 04:07.512
Yes, sorry.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.281
So how do I gather the intel?

04:09.283 --> 04:11.350
>> Oh, Jesus Chri...
Talk to people.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.218
I don't know, flirt with the
manager.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.187
He'll love how "pretty" and
"blonde" you are.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.922
>> Don't do that. I'm blonde.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.790
>> Look, my mind goes to that
office up there, you know?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.259
What kind of shady shit's going
on in there?

04:20.261 --> 04:22.294
And now I'm doing your job for
you.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.296
You know what, let's just go get
Charlie, 'cause I don't want to

04:24.298 --> 04:26.131
hold her hand through the whole
process.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.766
>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No Charlie. No Charlie, okay?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.568
I got this, you guys, I got
this.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.103
Don't worry about me, I got
this.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.971
>> Okay, we need you, Dee. Go.
Go.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.040
>> Go.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.580
>> It sucks not having our own
apartment.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.048
We got to get back in there,
dude.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.449
>> I know. I hate Dee.
Dennis, I hate her.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.917
>> I know, I know, but at least

04:45.919 --> 04:47.552
we got her out of our hair for a
little while.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.087
>> Yeah.
>> We can finally do our plan.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.555
>> Yes, okay.
(knocking at door)

04:50.557 --> 04:51.957
Oh, goddamn it.
>> What is that?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.458
>> Goddamn it! All right, look.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.793
Let's just deal with it, and

04:54.795 --> 04:56.161
then we can get back to
business.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.796
>> Yeah, okay.
All right, all right.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.798
(knocking continues)
>> I'm coming!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.833
I'm coming, Jesus Christ... oh.
>> Hey, guys.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.602
>> What do you want, Charlie?
We're busy.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.972
>> I wanted to apologize about,
um, snapping earlier today with

05:06.974 --> 05:10.342
words at you guys, and then I
came here to make an apology...

05:10.344 --> 05:12.110
apology words.
>> What's he talking about?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.478
>> I-I don't know.
I don't remember.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.813
Okay, thank you.
>> Well, hang on!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.248
Hang on a second.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.116
I got you guys a flower
arrangement for you.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.585
>> Great. Thanks.
>> Give it to him.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.154
>> You can't just have it.
There's a plan.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.689
I have to come in and give it to
you.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.123
And put it down.
>> All right, fine.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.692
Come in, put them down and then
go.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.360
>> Okay, and I'm in.
>> He's in.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.095
>> Okay. Uh...

05:30.097 --> 05:32.597
>> Put the vase close to them,
so we can see them.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.199
>> Right. Okay... and good.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.134
And where are you guys spending
the most of your time?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.803
>> It's a very small apartment.
We're all over the place.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.304
Just put them anywhere.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.373
>> And I'll put them down right
here, then.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.342
>> No. No good, move them.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.711
>> Can't put them here, though.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.279
(quiet chatter over earpiece)

05:47.281 --> 05:48.847
Where can I put them?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.782
>> Dude, any... put them in the
trash, for all we care.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.285
I don't... >> Putting them a
little further back, so...

05:53.287 --> 05:54.386
>> Yeah, that's good.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.521
>> And right about here.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.156
>> Uh, great, we don't care.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.291
It's fine.

05:59.293 --> 06:00.692
>> No, to the left.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.827
>> To the left, you say?

06:01.829 --> 06:02.994
>> Didn't say that.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.863
>> Don't talk out loud to me.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.131
>> Roger that.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.400
>> Who's Roger?
>> Who's Roger?

06:08.402 --> 06:12.971
Just... thinking about legally
changing my name to Roger.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.973
>> What's wrong with your ear,
dude?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.743
>> S... spider crawled up in my
ear.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.744
It was living there.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.745
>> Right.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.980
>> Sends its thoughts to me.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.882
>> Is it telling you to leave?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.717
>> Spider, can I leave?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.687
>> To the left.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.489
Right there, that's good.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.590
Now get out of there.

06:31.592 --> 06:35.360
>> Okay.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.928
>> Oh, Jesus Chr...

06:36.930 --> 06:38.764
>> Let's get back to business,
please.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.833
>> Yeah, come on.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.335
I was doing a little research

06:43.337 --> 06:46.571
earlier, and I stumbled upon
something huge.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.106
>> Hey, man.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.741
Can you hear and see everything?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.076
>> They're talking about
research.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.778
>> Research, huh?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.579
>> It is everything that we've
been looking for.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.448
Dude, it's gonna save us so much
time.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.216
It is a game-changer.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.751
Check this out.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.553
>> Oh, my God.
>> Yeah.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.121
>> There's so much potential
here!

07:03.123 --> 07:04.423
>> What is it?
>> This is great!

07:04.425 --> 07:05.590
>> I can't see.
>> Yeah, shit.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.025
>> So, listen, do me a favor.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.527
Give me a little bit of time
with this, okay?

07:08.529 --> 07:09.895
Let me dig in to this a little

07:09.897 --> 07:11.530
bit, see what the potential
really is.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.532
>> Yeah, I'll give you some
space. Okay.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.534
>> Yeah. Oh, oh, wait, Mac.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.535
>> Yeah?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.536
>> One more thing.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.204
>> Mm-hmm.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.206
>> Throw those goddamn flowers
in the trash.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.141
>> Yeah. Right.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.711
Pieces of shit.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.713
>> Goddamn it!
>> Son of a bitch.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.116
>> We got to get our hands on
that laptop!

07:31.118 --> 07:33.185
>> Right.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.761
>> Name's Dee.
I'm new around here.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.263
So, what's the deal with these
masks, huh?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.466
Are they gonna protect you from
the fish or protect the fish

07:47.468 --> 07:49.501
from you-- am I right?

07:49.503 --> 07:51.403
(woman speaking Chinese)

07:51.405 --> 07:53.171
No. I didn't get that.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.106
>> You chop fish, pull gut!

07:55.108 --> 07:57.242
>> "Pull gut." Totally, yeah.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.011
Listen, I'm gonna pop this off
'cause it's not protecting me

08:00.013 --> 08:02.581
from the smell, so I'm not
really sure what the point is.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.748
Hey. (clears throat)

08:03.750 --> 08:04.850
Give me the skinny.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.418
Are you guys up to anything

08:06.420 --> 08:09.354
non-fish related around here
or...?

08:09.356 --> 08:11.156
(woman speaks Chinese)

08:11.158 --> 08:12.924
Seriously?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.659
All right, goddamn it.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.862
You are of no use to me.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.297
Oh, here we go.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.599
Uh, excuse me. Hello.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.601
Hi. Um...

08:22.603 --> 08:26.204
Uh, my name's Dee and I'm new
around here, and I just would

08:26.206 --> 08:28.974
love to chat with you sometime
in private, you know?

08:28.976 --> 08:32.544
Maybe up in your secret private
office up there?

08:32.546 --> 08:34.880
>> I need you to chop fish and
pull the gut.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.548
>> Yeah. No, I get it.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.617
I-I get that you're a chop fish,
pull gut factory.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.652
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't go anywhere. Hi.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.388
Um, uh, how about this, huh?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.891
Uh-oh. What do you see, huh?

08:45.893 --> 08:50.529
American girl, blue eyes, blonde
hair... (screams)

08:50.531 --> 08:52.130
(man shouting in Chinese)

08:52.132 --> 08:54.232
It got me! It got me good!

08:54.234 --> 08:55.734
(screaming)

08:55.736 --> 08:57.202
Aah! It got in my mouth!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.137
It's getting in...
(alarm blaring)

08:59.139 --> 09:01.206
(screams)

09:04.711 --> 09:06.711
>> Hi.
Hey, guys.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.713
>> What are you doing, dude?
You texted us 911.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.715
What's the emergency?
>> Yeah.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.184
>> Oh, yeah, uh, well, our
friendship's in danger, so...

09:13.186 --> 09:14.886
I stole Frank's credit card.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.888
You guys want to have lunch?
>> You got Frank's card?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.690
>> I got the card.
>> I'm annoyed, but I could eat.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.525
All right, let's go.
>> Yeah, to be honest with you,

09:20.527 --> 09:22.160
my taste for fish is returning.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.995
>> Yeah, I've been thinking
about it all day.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.830
>> My taste for fish is slowly
returning, too. Yeah.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.365
And Guigino's does have the best
fish. Very well!

09:27.367 --> 09:28.767
>> All right, you know, maybe,

09:28.769 --> 09:30.435
uh... maybe just order a couple
apps though.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.937
I think Frank would prefer that.
You know, that's...

09:31.939 --> 09:33.605
>> Who cares what Frank prefers?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.574
We're buying this food with his
stolen credit card.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.410
>> And I'm gonna pretend I
didn't hear that. (chuckles)

09:40.347 --> 09:41.880
Uh, welcome back, gentlemen.
>> I'm sorry.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.515
Do I know you, pal?

09:43.517 --> 09:45.350
>> I've never seen this man
before in my life.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.586
>> I waited on you before.
You tied my shoelaces together.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.087
I fell down.
>> I'm getting nothing.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.589
I'm drawing a blank on this guy.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.223
>> Yeah, yeah, that means
nothing to me.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.092
What are you saying?
A scalding hot plate of

09:54.094 --> 09:56.094
spaghetti fell into my face?
>> I'm to remember every man

09:56.096 --> 09:58.096
I've seen fall into a plate of
spaghetti?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.098
>> Never mind.
Uh, can I get your order?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.300
>> Get me the snapper, bozo.
>> Snapper fish for the man.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.736
>> Actually, our fish supplier
had an incident at their

10:04.738 --> 10:06.738
facility, so we are limited on
fish.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.740
Market price is quite high
today.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.742
>> Do you have the snapper
or not?

10:10.744 --> 10:12.577
>> Yeah, uh, we do.
But it's $44.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.379
>> Ooh. Oh, my God. All right.
Well, then, let's do some

10:14.381 --> 10:16.147
cheaper chicken or, uh...
>> Well, no. I'm in a fish mood

10:16.149 --> 10:17.549
now. Fish has been established.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.250
>> It was established,
wasn't it?

10:19.252 --> 10:21.086
>> Yeah, it was.
So three snappers.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.921
>> Yeah, why are we talking
about it so much?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.656
Get the goddamn snappers!
>> Okay... oh...

10:24.658 --> 10:26.291
>> Get the snapper!
>> Jesus Christ.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.892
>> Who is that guy?
>> Guigino's is slipping.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.127
It's slipping.
>> It is, they are slipping.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.629
They do have great fish, though.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.464
>> So, what's going on with our
friendship?

10:32.466 --> 10:33.465
>> Yeah.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.533
>> Okay.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.103
>> Ha!

10:38.105 --> 10:39.437
Charlie, I'm in.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.106
How you doing? You having lunch?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.674
Keeping them busy?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.343
>> Uh, yeah, but slight hitch,
though.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.278
The snapper is, uh, $44.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.747
>> What?!

10:48.749 --> 10:50.081
No, no, no, no $44!

10:50.083 --> 10:51.850
Get them appetizers.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.285
>> I know, but, like, they want
fish and I kind of want fish,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.521
too, and the waiter said it's
the market price, so...

10:56.523 --> 10:58.957
>> All right. Wait, I got the
laptop.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.426
Let me go to the search history.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.167
Holy shit!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.468
>> Damn it!

11:10.470 --> 11:12.504
Sweeping up fish guts with a
broom!

11:12.506 --> 11:14.506
Got to be some kind of workers'
rights violation.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.107
What are you...?! Aah!

11:16.109 --> 11:18.109
You idiot! What are you picking
it up with your hands?!

11:18.111 --> 11:20.011
(woman speaking Chinese)

11:20.013 --> 11:21.946
Uh, hell no, lady, no.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.649
Uh, look, I realize this might
all be moon talk to you, but I'm

11:24.651 --> 11:27.052
not touching fish guts with my
hands, okay?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.554
You know what we could do?
Yeah, let's just disperse it.

11:29.556 --> 11:30.822
You know what I mean?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.290
Just send it all over the place!

11:32.292 --> 11:34.292
Nobody will know.
Just kind of...

11:34.294 --> 11:36.361
(tires screeching)

11:41.334 --> 11:42.634
(alarm blaring)

11:42.636 --> 11:44.736
(workers clamoring)

11:44.738 --> 11:46.404
Oh...

11:46.406 --> 11:48.039
Yeah, it's so crazy.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.542
I saw that.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.817
>> Hey, Frank.
Sweet hat and jacket.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.819
>> Don't.. Charlie, don't
sit there.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.821
>> Huh?
>> Sit back there.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.589
We got to be smart about this.
>> Yeah, all right.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.424
Why didn't we just meet back at
the apartment then?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.892
That would've been better.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.828
>> Because you got me thinking
about fish.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.830
>> Oh, right, nice. Yeah.
Get the snapper. It's delicious.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.832
>> Mmm.
>> Hi. How can I help you?

12:13.834 --> 12:16.234
>> Oh, perfect.
You're here now, too.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.336
>> You're talking to me like you
know me.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.338
Have we ever met?
>> Let's just move past this

12:20.340 --> 12:22.607
part. What can I get you?
>> I'm gonna have the snapper.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.109
And I'm gonna buy one for the

12:24.111 --> 12:26.878
strange man behind me who I've
never met.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.280
>> Gentlemen, I hate to inform
you two... strangers here that

12:29.282 --> 12:31.015
we are out of snapper.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.685
We had some issues with our
local supplier, so we are

12:33.687 --> 12:34.919
completely out of fish today.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.354
>> How do you not have fish?!

12:36.356 --> 12:38.757
It says "Fresh fish daily" on
the menu.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.359
>> Well, I just explained it.
I went step by step.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.361
>> But how come you don't have
it? It's on the menu!

12:43.363 --> 12:45.363
>> For the reasons I said.
>> You have no snapper?!

12:45.365 --> 12:46.865
>> There's a sequence of
events...

12:46.867 --> 12:48.366
>> It says right here snapper...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.201
>> Do you have fish or do you
not have fish?

12:50.203 --> 12:52.203
>> Can I get you a non-fish
entree?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.038
>> You can get lost.
>> With pleasure.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.940
>> All right, so...
what did you find out?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.042
>> I think I know what those
guys are up to.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.111
>> Can I just sit over there?
'Cause I feel like the cover's

13:00.113 --> 13:02.113
blown now, and now I have to go
like...

13:02.115 --> 13:04.115
>> All right, sit over here.
>> You know what I mean?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.417
>> I think I know what they're
up to.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.153
>> Okay, what?
>> I think Mac and Dennis are

13:08.155 --> 13:10.221
going into business with the
Chinese guys across the street.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.923
>> What?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.958
>> They're gonna open up some
kind of pastry factory!

13:13.960 --> 13:16.060
>> What? What makes you think
that?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.496
>> I saw it on their search
history.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.431
Only two words came up.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.001
"Asians..."

13:23.003 --> 13:25.336
and "cream pies."

13:25.338 --> 13:26.638
>> Oh, shit.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.106
>> They're gonna turn Paddy's

13:28.108 --> 13:30.141
into some kind of Asian cream
pie factory!

13:30.143 --> 13:32.143
>> Those bastards!
>> Yeah!

13:32.145 --> 13:33.778
>> Oh, my God!
>> Sons of bitches!

13:33.780 --> 13:35.146
>> So, what are we gonna do?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.148
>> We got to beat them at their
own game.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.118
Okay, the Chinese want cream
pies, they'll get cream pies.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.620
But only, they're not gonna get
them from those bozos.

13:42.622 --> 13:47.525
They're gonna be getting their
cream pies from us.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.764
(Charlie laughs)

13:57.204 --> 13:59.137
>> MAC: Can I go now?
Because I feel like you had a

13:59.139 --> 14:01.139
really long session last time.
>> I did, yeah, I went on for a

14:01.141 --> 14:02.974
long, long time, but that's how
much it takes, all right?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.843
I'm trying to build up to
something, to-to a major

14:04.845 --> 14:06.678
finish, you know?
And-and I didn't get to because

14:06.680 --> 14:08.680
Charlie interrupted us with his
goddamn emergency lunch.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.782
What are you doing?
I really don't want to stumble

14:10.784 --> 14:12.550
across whatever it is that
you're stumbling across.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.052
Let me finish.
>> Wait, no, this... we got a

14:14.054 --> 14:15.453
problem here.
>> What?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.388
>> The Internet's not working.
>> What?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.558
No... No!

14:20.560 --> 14:21.659
(phone ringing)

14:21.661 --> 14:23.061
Come on!

14:23.063 --> 14:25.163
Oh, son of a bitch.
>> What is it, Charlie?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.831
We're in the middle of a crisis.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.733
>> Trouble getting online?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.635
>> Yeah, how did you know that?

14:30.637 --> 14:32.804
>> We need to talk.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.011
>> Hi, how can I help...
Oh, you're back.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.679
>> Why do you look familiar to
me?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.248
>> I'm the waiter you didn't tip
earlier.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.582
>> Yeah, well, you're not gonna

14:44.584 --> 14:45.884
get tipped again with that
attitude.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.352
(Dennis and Mac laugh)

14:47.354 --> 14:49.420
We'll take the snapper.
Uh, this guy, too.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.089
He's-he's with us.
>> Well, as I told this

14:51.091 --> 14:54.092
gentleman only moments ago, we
are out of fish today.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.261
>> We came to Guigino's for the
fish.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.496
It says "Fresh fish daily."
>> Uh, you know what, Dennis?

14:58.498 --> 15:01.065
I'll have a plate of piping hot
spaghetti instead.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.600
Extra sauce.
(Dennis sighs)

15:02.602 --> 15:04.269
>> All right. You know what?
That sounds good.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.070
I'll-I'll take spaghetti, too.
Nice and sloppy.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.605
>> So you do remember me.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.340
>> We're busy! Okay?
Can we get spaghetti?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.109
>> He wants spaghetti.
I want spaghetti, too, please.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.044
>> He's gonna get spaghetti.
Just get us the spaghetti.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.579
>> And some snapper fish, if you
have it.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.847
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you, thank you...

15:15.849 --> 15:17.348
>> What's that guy's attitude?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.783
>> I don't know what that guy's
deal is.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.184
Hey, you know what we should do?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.286
We should tie his shoelaces
together.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.720

cover; you're, uh, dressed

And honestly, guys, you should

15:44.644 --> 15:45.877
be ashamed of yourselves.
Really.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.645
>> What? I'm not ashamed.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.247

I think that's natural.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.548

be into that.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.795

That's bizarre.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.730

16:05.732 --> 16:07.398
