00:17.522 --> 00:19.589
No! No! No! No!

00:20.792 --> 00:22.525
Daddy, I want to go home!

00:25.464 --> 00:27.430
No! No!

00:28.533 --> 00:30.900
Here's Daddy. Here's Daddy.

00:30.902 --> 00:32.168
It's just a bad dream,
sweetheart.

00:32.170 --> 00:33.603
It's just a bad dream.

00:33.605 --> 00:35.738
I got you.

00:35.740 --> 00:38.241
I got you.

00:38.243 --> 00:40.777
I got you.
I got you, sweetie.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.446
It's gonna be all right.
It's all right.

01:01.099 --> 01:04.566
Been a few weeks now
since the last one.

01:04.569 --> 01:06.436
Beginning to think maybe
she's ready to get past it,

01:06.438 --> 01:09.239
but last night,
man, it just...

01:11.676 --> 01:13.877
It was awful.

01:13.879 --> 01:15.945
Another nightmare, huh?

01:15.947 --> 01:17.647
Yeah.

01:18.450 --> 01:21.518
The whole thing--
the abduction...

01:21.520 --> 01:24.521
and being locked
up in a cage...

01:24.523 --> 01:27.357
and watching
Ian die and...

01:27.359 --> 01:30.293
It just plays over and over
on a loop in her head.

01:30.295 --> 01:33.263
And she can't...
It just never ends.

01:33.265 --> 01:36.099
That son of a
bitch Ian, man.

01:36.101 --> 01:38.034
He really got
under my daughter's skin.

01:38.036 --> 01:39.903
She can't shake it.

01:39.905 --> 01:43.373
Yeah.

01:43.375 --> 01:47.176
We both know what it's like
not to want to close your eyes.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.918
Only cure for that though
is time.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.087
This is killing me.

02:00.292 --> 02:02.725
I feel utterly helpless.

02:02.727 --> 02:05.628
Every night, I pray to God
to take this thing off of her

02:05.630 --> 02:07.764
and put it on me
'cause I can handle it.

02:07.766 --> 02:09.164
This is my little girl.

02:14.039 --> 02:16.573
She shouldn't
have to carry this.

02:19.678 --> 02:21.210
You know what though, Lou?

02:21.212 --> 02:23.580
Let me tell you something.

02:23.582 --> 02:26.883
You're doing
the only thing you can do.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.685
You're being there
for Samantha.

02:28.687 --> 02:30.620
Knowing she's got
a father that loves her

02:30.622 --> 02:34.223
and will do whatever it takes
to keep her safe...

02:34.225 --> 02:35.391
that's exactly

02:35.393 --> 02:37.427
what she needs right now.

02:48.273 --> 02:49.806
<i>Fool!</i>

02:49.808 --> 02:51.841
<i>You've fallen</i>
<i>right into my trap!</i>

02:51.843 --> 02:53.009
<i>Without you to protect them,</i>

02:53.011 --> 02:55.678
the people of Earth
will perish!

02:55.680 --> 02:58.081
You better get in there
and help save Gotham.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.149
Carpool's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

03:00.151 --> 03:03.720
All right, you two warriors!
Let me see this!

03:04.923 --> 03:06.956
Let's go, Supermen.

03:08.026 --> 03:09.892
To school!

03:09.894 --> 03:11.828
Capes down,
brush your teeth,

03:11.830 --> 03:14.464
grab your backpacks.

03:14.466 --> 03:17.166
I really appreciate you
rearranging your day like this.

03:17.168 --> 03:19.035
I know it's a pain.
Hey.

03:19.037 --> 03:20.837
Comes with the territory
when you are married

03:20.839 --> 03:22.472
to a real superhero.

03:22.474 --> 03:24.707
I'll make it up to you tonight.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.175
Mm.
I promise.

03:26.177 --> 03:28.177
You always do.

03:28.179 --> 03:29.545
I...
Not negotiable.

03:29.547 --> 03:32.415
You have a long day
of surgery ahead.

03:32.417 --> 03:33.983
Love you.

03:33.985 --> 03:35.818
I love you, too.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.455
I wish you could babysit
me every day, Poppy.

03:39.457 --> 03:42.725
I wish I could, too, kiddo.

03:42.727 --> 03:44.327
Are you gonna be here
after school?

03:44.329 --> 03:46.829
Oh, you better
believe it.

03:46.831 --> 03:50.366
Um, your parents
get home

03:50.368 --> 03:53.236
around dinner time, eh?

03:53.238 --> 03:57.440
What do you say we take them
to J.J. Dolan's for some pizza?

03:57.442 --> 03:59.142
Cool.

03:59.144 --> 04:01.611
We're gonna
have fun, Poppy.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.379
We sure will.

04:03.381 --> 04:06.315
Be a good boy.

04:06.317 --> 04:09.085
You, too.

04:21.099 --> 04:23.433
- Is the patient prepped?
- Yes.

04:23.435 --> 04:25.635
Okay, go ahead and place
an A line and a central line

04:25.637 --> 04:27.770
before he goes into the O.R.
Do you want me to call a...?

04:27.772 --> 04:29.572
Yes, and then we can put
the ventricular drain

04:29.574 --> 04:30.973
to stabilize
the intracranial bleeding.

04:30.975 --> 04:32.208
How far out are you?

04:32.210 --> 04:33.242
I'll be up in a minute.

04:33.244 --> 04:34.811
I'm pulling into the garage now.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.456
Forget about last year.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.457
This year's gonna be different.

05:54.459 --> 05:56.893
Thanks for helping me,

Danno says

05:58.630 --> 05:59.896

Don't worry
about Danno.

06:01.132 --> 06:02.698
You know, it
scares me to think

06:02.700 --> 06:03.733
what that guy's gonna be like

06:03.735 --> 06:05.501
when he actually is
a grumpy old man.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.041
That looks just like your car,
Uncle Steve.

06:15.914 --> 06:18.681
Because it is my car.

06:21.319 --> 06:22.618
Listen to me, you don't...
you don't move from this spot.

06:22.620 --> 06:23.786
Okay? You don't talk
to anybody...

06:23.788 --> 06:25.388
Okay, I won't.

06:25.390 --> 06:26.722
Don't move, all right?
I won't, I won't. I promise.

06:26.724 --> 06:28.925
Go!

06:43.474 --> 06:45.474
Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:45.476 --> 06:47.243
Son of a bitch!

06:50.682 --> 06:52.014
Son of a bitch.

06:52.016 --> 06:53.850
McGarrett.

06:53.852 --> 06:55.852
All right, I'm on the way.

06:55.854 --> 06:57.520
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't hang up.

06:57.522 --> 06:59.255
I need to report a stolen car.

06:59.257 --> 07:00.923
It's mine.

07:13.071 --> 07:14.303
Yo.
Hey.

07:14.305 --> 07:15.705
Let me ask you a question.

07:15.707 --> 07:17.974
Okay? At what point

07:17.976 --> 07:20.009
did you think that it was
a good idea to leave

07:20.011 --> 07:21.677
my innocent
12-year-old daughter alone

07:21.679 --> 07:23.412
in a... in a deserted street
by herself?

07:23.414 --> 07:24.914
When did you think
that was okay?

07:24.916 --> 07:25.882
Good morning. I'm fine.

07:25.884 --> 07:27.016
How are you though?
No.

07:27.018 --> 07:28.351
No, no, no, no.
Don't do that, okay?

07:28.353 --> 07:29.685
Answer the question.
What?

07:29.687 --> 07:31.654
It's not like I left her
in the middle of Makaha.

07:31.656 --> 07:32.656
Oh, right, right.
Huh?

07:32.657 --> 07:34.190
Because deviants
and nutjobs

07:34.192 --> 07:35.424
and psychopaths,
they only hunt victims

07:35.426 --> 07:36.926
in-in high-crime neighborhoods.
Is that right?

07:36.928 --> 07:38.828
She was never in
any danger, Danny.

07:38.830 --> 07:40.763
I left for, like,
not even five minutes.

07:40.765 --> 07:42.331
Okay? I mean...

07:42.333 --> 07:43.733
you're overreacting
like usual.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.067
Excu... I'm overreacting?
Yeah, you're over...

07:45.069 --> 07:46.502
I'm sorry I don't
obsess over

07:46.504 --> 07:49.238
every possible worst-case
scenario in life.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.407
No, no. You obsess
over a death trap on wheels.

07:51.409 --> 07:53.242
You know what?
That car is a classic.

07:53.244 --> 07:54.777
Mind yourself.
Oh, please.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.712
With the sales pitch. It's a
classic piece of junk, that car.

07:56.714 --> 07:58.147
You know what that
car means to me.

07:58.149 --> 07:59.315
Uh-huh.
Do you not?

07:59.317 --> 08:00.283
All right, don't do that, okay?

08:00.285 --> 08:01.384
You do something wrong,
and then somehow

08:01.386 --> 08:02.585
you turn it around
and I'm the bad guy.

08:02.587 --> 08:03.619
You are the bad guy.
You can't see

08:03.621 --> 08:04.654
how you're the bad
guy in this?

08:04.656 --> 08:05.621
No, I don't.

08:05.623 --> 08:07.063
You guys still
seeing that therapist?

08:08.593 --> 08:10.626
All right, you need
a few more sessions.

08:10.628 --> 08:13.529
Our victim's name is
Dr. Christine DuPont.

08:13.531 --> 08:15.164
She's a chief neurosurgeon
on staff here.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.333
She was called in this
morning on her day off

08:17.335 --> 08:18.401
to perform an emergency surgery.

08:18.403 --> 08:19.669
Not only did the shooter

08:19.671 --> 08:21.370
know the doctor's schedule,

08:21.372 --> 08:24.507
he also knew the entire
hospital security system layout.

08:24.509 --> 08:26.509
He managed to get
in and out of here

08:26.511 --> 08:28.744
without once getting
his mug picked up on camera.

08:28.746 --> 08:29.879
Commander,
you might want to take

08:29.881 --> 08:31.047
a look at this.

08:31.049 --> 08:32.280
Fell out of
the doctor's clothing.

08:32.283 --> 08:33.416
It looks like
a through-and-through.

08:33.418 --> 08:35.284
Copper-jacketed.

08:35.285 --> 08:37.852
Probably nine-millimeter
semi-auto.

08:37.855 --> 08:39.522
No shell casings
found at the scene.

08:39.524 --> 08:41.557
Shooter must have policed
his own brass.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.292
This was a well-planned hit.

08:43.294 --> 08:45.628
Who puts a hit out
on a brain surgeon?

08:45.630 --> 08:46.862
This might explain it.

08:46.864 --> 08:50.967
Dr. DuPont was brought in
to operate on Paul Delano.

08:53.471 --> 08:54.904
Who in the hell is that?

08:54.906 --> 08:56.839
He's a, um,
organized crime guy

08:56.841 --> 08:58.240
that we have a bad
history with.

08:58.242 --> 09:00.343
He was brought in this morning
from Halawa Prison,

09:00.345 --> 09:02.545
and according to the warden,
he went to the infirmary

09:02.547 --> 09:04.146
last night complaining
of a severe headache.

09:04.148 --> 09:05.614
The CAT scan showed
a slow-leaking

09:05.616 --> 09:07.616
brain aneurysm, but because
of the delicate location

09:07.618 --> 09:08.718
of the hemorrhage,

09:08.720 --> 09:11.153
Dr. DuPont was the
best chance they had

09:11.155 --> 09:12.355
of saving Delano's life.

09:12.357 --> 09:14.690
Looks like somebody
didn't want that to happen.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.910
Gang Intel in Halawa
has an informant

09:25.910 --> 09:29.579
in general pop who says that
Delano has been bragging about

09:29.581 --> 09:32.014
running his O.C. operations
from inside the prison.

09:32.016 --> 09:34.884
Well, the easiest place to get
him would have been from inside,

09:34.886 --> 09:36.886
so that kind of rules
out other inmates.

09:36.888 --> 09:39.088
Mm-hmm. And the prison ward
here is well protected.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.123
Taking out a surgeon
from the parking garage

09:41.125 --> 09:43.659
was a much easier play.

09:43.661 --> 09:47.063
You know, could be a
rival crew on the outside

09:47.065 --> 09:49.498
looking to take out
some competition.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.901
Yeah, or it could've been
one of Delano's crew

09:51.903 --> 09:53.936
trying to move up
the chain of command.

09:53.938 --> 09:56.172
Anyway, this guy's got
no shortage of enemies.

09:56.174 --> 09:58.374
So that info on
our Vic coming in

09:58.376 --> 10:00.076
to perform a surgery
on her day off,

10:00.078 --> 10:02.545
that had to come from someone
on the hospital staff

10:02.547 --> 10:04.113
or someone inside
Delano's inner circle.

10:04.115 --> 10:05.481
Yep, I agree with you.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.750
That's the only way that hit
could have been pulled off

10:07.752 --> 10:08.818
as quickly as it was.

10:08.820 --> 10:11.387
Mm-hmm. I had HPD put
a protection detail

10:11.389 --> 10:14.757
on the surgeon who came in
to replace Dr. DuPont.

10:26.638 --> 10:28.137
Well, well, well.

10:28.139 --> 10:30.706
If it isn't Lieutenant
Chin Ho Kelly,

10:30.708 --> 10:32.808
as I live and breathe.

10:32.810 --> 10:35.278
Yeah, well, hopefully, that
won't be for too much longer.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.346
How's what's left of the family?

10:38.916 --> 10:40.249
Keep talking, all right?

10:40.251 --> 10:42.051
I'm gonna do these nice people
a favor and open up

10:42.053 --> 10:44.153
that big head of yours
before you get in the O.R.

10:44.155 --> 10:45.621
What's going on here?

10:45.623 --> 10:47.123
This man's about
to go into surgery.

10:47.125 --> 10:50.026
Doc, I'd like you to meet
two of my dearest of friends.

10:50.028 --> 10:53.262
This is Steve McGarrett
and Chin Ho Kelly.

10:53.264 --> 10:54.430
They're two of
Five-O's finest.

10:54.432 --> 10:56.766
My brother murdered Kelly's wife

10:56.768 --> 10:58.968
two years ago-- he's
still sore about it.

10:58.970 --> 11:01.304
Go figure.

11:01.306 --> 11:03.272
Hey, Doc, we're gonna need
another minute with this guy.

11:03.274 --> 11:04.507
He doesn't have another minute.

11:04.509 --> 11:06.676
This man needs an operation now
or he could die.

11:06.678 --> 11:08.844
In that case,
we need five more.

11:08.846 --> 11:10.913
If you delay him,
and he dies,

11:10.915 --> 11:11.981
that's murder.

11:11.983 --> 11:15.551
I think it's best
if you wait outside.

11:15.553 --> 11:16.852
Right now, let's go.

11:17.722 --> 11:19.622
I like your style, boys.

11:19.624 --> 11:21.157
As charming as ever.

11:21.159 --> 11:23.125
What'd I just
tell you before?

11:23.127 --> 11:24.794
I told you to shut up,
all right?

11:24.796 --> 11:26.529
Your surgeon

11:26.531 --> 11:28.331
was assassinated
in the parking lot this morning.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.533
We think it was to take you out
by proxy.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.175
Are you serious?

11:39.177 --> 11:42.411
Do you actually think we want
to be here talking to you?

11:42.413 --> 11:45.581
Wh-Who do you think
is behind it?

11:45.583 --> 11:47.283
Well, that was my next question
for you.

11:47.285 --> 11:48.484
I mean, you're the one
who's been

11:48.486 --> 11:49.819
shooting your mouth off
in Halawa,

11:49.821 --> 11:52.088
talking about running your shop
from the inside.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.056
Why don't we start
with the people

11:54.058 --> 11:56.859
who have more to gain
from seeing you dead than alive.

11:56.861 --> 11:58.728
Present company excluded.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.900
All right. All right.

12:08.206 --> 12:12.108
The only thing I've been running
in the joint is my mouth.

12:12.110 --> 12:14.377
I'm broke,

12:14.379 --> 12:15.811
and there's no
organization left.

12:15.813 --> 12:17.146
But as long as
those animals

12:17.148 --> 12:20.683
think that I got some kind
of juice on the outside,

12:20.685 --> 12:23.119
that's what keeps me alive
in that hellhole.

12:23.121 --> 12:24.653
Now, this lady doc,
I understand

12:24.655 --> 12:26.655
she was my best shot
at getting out of here alive.

12:26.657 --> 12:28.257
If I knew who was

12:28.259 --> 12:30.126
trying to whack me,
I would tell you,

12:30.128 --> 12:31.927
but not because I like you.

12:33.564 --> 12:35.564
Because if I have
to go back to Halawa,

12:35.566 --> 12:37.299
I'm not gonna be
that hard to find.

12:37.301 --> 12:39.435
Your minute's up.

12:39.437 --> 12:41.103
This is
absolutely outrageous.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.304
He's all yours, Doc.

12:42.306 --> 12:43.873
You know, Kelly,

12:43.875 --> 12:45.941
if I do happen
to make it out,

12:45.943 --> 12:48.644
I would be very, very interested

12:48.646 --> 12:51.647
in seeing you again
on the outside sometime.

12:51.649 --> 12:54.817
You know where to find me.

12:54.819 --> 12:57.386
Oh, you bet your ass I do.

12:59.223 --> 13:01.190
Uh, but, uh...

13:01.192 --> 13:03.926
should I not make it,

13:03.928 --> 13:07.396
I'll be sure to say hello
to your wife for you.

13:13.438 --> 13:15.871
Who would want
to kill Christine?

13:15.873 --> 13:17.840
Well, at first we believed
it was to prevent her

13:17.842 --> 13:20.476
from operating on a convict
who had a lot of enemies.

13:20.478 --> 13:22.545
But we've since found out
that's not the case.

13:22.547 --> 13:25.114
It just doesn't
make any sense.

13:25.116 --> 13:27.750
Did you notice
any unusual behavior

13:27.752 --> 13:29.485
from your wife recently?

13:29.487 --> 13:31.987
Uh, she stayed late
at the office

13:31.989 --> 13:34.590
a couple of
nights last week.

13:34.592 --> 13:36.325
She said she
had to check

13:36.327 --> 13:39.662
on some... something
personal for a patient.

13:39.664 --> 13:41.864
Did she happen to say
what that is?

13:44.402 --> 13:47.570
Mr. DuPont,
are you sure that

13:47.572 --> 13:49.638
your wife didn't mention
anything about this?

13:49.640 --> 13:52.007
Even the smallest thing
can be important.

13:52.009 --> 13:53.175
No.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.610
I-I'm sorry.

13:54.612 --> 13:57.947
W-With two kids and both
of us working full-time,

13:57.949 --> 13:59.882
we barely saw each other
during the week,

13:59.884 --> 14:01.650
and when we did, we-we really

14:01.652 --> 14:03.752
tried not to talk shop.

14:03.754 --> 14:06.789
She was gonna fill me in
this weekend.

14:06.791 --> 14:11.393
W-We had plans
to take the boys to the beach.

14:15.433 --> 14:18.501
What do I tell them?

14:37.221 --> 14:40.623
Recognize this theme?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.460
I didn't think so.

14:44.462 --> 14:45.761
It's "Merry Widow"

14:45.763 --> 14:47.897
from Alfred Hitchcock's
<i>Shadow of a Doubt,</i>

14:47.899 --> 14:50.633
written by
Dimitri Tiomkin, 1943.

14:50.635 --> 14:53.302
Considered one of the greatest
psychological thrillers

14:53.304 --> 14:55.204
of all time.

14:55.206 --> 14:56.906
Ah, very nice, very nice.

14:56.908 --> 14:59.074
Is that why were here, Max,
for movie trivia?

14:59.944 --> 15:02.177
Just setting the mood.

15:02.179 --> 15:04.246
Oh, that's nice.

15:04.248 --> 15:05.881
This man was brought in
from the ICU

15:05.883 --> 15:07.750
of the Kuakini Medical Center
last night

15:07.752 --> 15:09.785
for a routine clinical autopsy.

15:09.787 --> 15:12.988
He was recently diagnosed
with terminal brain cancer

15:12.990 --> 15:14.990
while incarcerated
in the Oahu Correctional.

15:14.992 --> 15:16.759
They deemed the tumor
to be inoperable,

15:16.761 --> 15:19.028
so they sent him
to the ICU last week

15:19.030 --> 15:20.529
for end-of-life care.

15:20.531 --> 15:21.997
Okay, that's a good story, Max.

15:21.999 --> 15:23.499
What does it have to do
with her murder?

15:23.501 --> 15:26.835
Ah, in usual form, Detective,
you've managed to trample

15:26.837 --> 15:28.170
on the punch line.

15:28.172 --> 15:30.573
As I was about to say, before
I was so rudely interrupted,

15:30.575 --> 15:34.543
was that Dr. DuPont
was also Mr. Tahni's surgeon.

15:34.545 --> 15:36.412
Okay, well, I'm sure, Max,

15:36.414 --> 15:37.880
that she operated
on many patients.

15:37.882 --> 15:39.315
Tahni had a brain tumor.

15:39.317 --> 15:41.417
She's a neurosurgeon.
That's what neurosurgeons do.

15:41.419 --> 15:43.085
Yes, that is correct.

15:43.087 --> 15:45.454
But what we have here is
more than just coincidence.

15:45.456 --> 15:47.590
In fact, Hitchcock himself
would have been amused

15:47.592 --> 15:50.025
at the strange confluence
of circumstances.

15:50.027 --> 15:51.560
Really? Why is that?

15:51.562 --> 15:53.929
Because cancer didn't kill
Mr. Tahni.

15:53.931 --> 15:55.397
It was murder.

15:56.367 --> 15:57.766
Behold.

15:58.836 --> 16:01.403
As you can see
by the ruptured blood vessel

16:01.405 --> 16:04.106
in the sclera, Mr. Tahni died
of asphyxiation.

16:04.108 --> 16:06.542
The cotton fibers
that I recovered

16:06.544 --> 16:08.577
from the trachea
and lungs tells me

16:08.579 --> 16:11.246
that he was most likely
smothered to death by a pillow.

16:11.248 --> 16:13.515
All right, so the night

16:13.517 --> 16:17.186
before Dr. DuPont gets taken out
in the parking lot,

16:17.188 --> 16:19.421
someone sneaks into the ICU

16:19.423 --> 16:20.889
and takes out
one of her patients.

16:20.891 --> 16:21.890
That can't be a coincidence.

16:21.892 --> 16:23.359
These murders
are connected, right?

16:23.361 --> 16:24.426
Okay, but why kill a man

16:24.428 --> 16:26.362
who has less than
a week to live?

16:57.019 --> 16:58.886
Son of a bitch.

16:58.888 --> 17:00.587
It's not that bad, McGarrett.

17:00.589 --> 17:01.788
It's not that bad?

17:01.790 --> 17:03.323
There's no wheels on my car.

17:03.325 --> 17:05.726
There's no physical damage
other than parts missing,

17:05.728 --> 17:07.060
and those are all replaceable.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.662
They're not replaceable.

17:08.664 --> 17:10.964
Everything on this car
except for the windshield

17:10.965 --> 17:12.733
is original from the factory,

17:12.734 --> 17:14.601
just like the day my dad
brought it home.

17:14.603 --> 17:16.970
There's a homeless encampment
on the beach not far from here.

17:16.972 --> 17:18.672
Maybe somebody
saw something.

17:18.674 --> 17:20.840
Listen, I want any spare units
canvassing the area

17:20.843 --> 17:23.877
for anybody who may have seen
somebody driving her, all right?

17:23.878 --> 17:26.280
I don't care what you got to do.
We got to find this guy.

17:26.281 --> 17:28.315
You may also want
to look at this.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.519
Whoever's been
stripping the car

17:32.521 --> 17:34.388
left their tools behind.

17:34.390 --> 17:36.857
I'm thinking they'll
probably be back for more.

17:36.859 --> 17:39.826
You know what?
Leave it just where it is.

17:39.828 --> 17:41.762
Duke, I want around-the-clock
surveillance on it.

17:41.764 --> 17:43.130
Contact Auto Crime.

17:43.132 --> 17:44.364
Have them canvass the area

17:44.366 --> 17:45.866
for all the body shops
around here,

17:45.868 --> 17:48.101
see if we can find the jackass
selling my parts.

17:48.103 --> 17:49.236
Will do.

17:49.238 --> 17:51.805
You want me to get CSU down here
to process first?

17:51.807 --> 17:53.140
No, it's just
gonna attract

17:53.142 --> 17:54.875
unnecessary attention.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.777
What is all that?

17:56.779 --> 17:59.680
This is a vintage automobile
survival kit.

18:14.296 --> 18:15.996
What is he doing?

18:15.998 --> 18:17.664
Not needing CSU.

18:29.712 --> 18:31.445
Bingo.

18:31.447 --> 18:35.082
Pua, run these prints
through AFIS.

18:35.084 --> 18:36.283
See if we get a hit.

18:36.285 --> 18:38.485
Right away.

18:41.690 --> 18:44.024
<i>Well, Tahni wasn't gonna win</i>

18:44.026 --> 18:45.325
any citizenship awards,
that's for sure.

18:45.327 --> 18:47.794
This guy spent 40
of his 55 years on this planet

18:47.796 --> 18:49.162
in some type
of correctional facility.

18:49.164 --> 18:50.464
At age 14,

18:50.466 --> 18:53.533
he spent two years at the
Wailea Reform School for Boys

18:53.535 --> 18:55.002
after committing
multiple burglaries.

18:55.004 --> 18:57.604
At age 16,
one month out of Wailea,

18:57.606 --> 18:59.773
he committed a home invasion
robbery and murdered

18:59.775 --> 19:01.141
the homeowner in the process.

19:01.143 --> 19:03.610
That earned him a life sentence
at Oahu Correctional.

19:03.612 --> 19:06.046
Prison records say that
he hasn't had contact

19:06.048 --> 19:08.215
with the outside world
in several years now.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.516
How'd he do inside?

19:09.518 --> 19:12.285
Model prisoner,
kept to himself.

19:12.287 --> 19:15.155
Doesn't sound like the kind of
guy who's had too many enemies.

19:15.157 --> 19:17.457
Yeah, well,
neither did Dr. DuPont,

19:17.459 --> 19:20.427
but we-we know they both had
at least one, right?

19:20.429 --> 19:21.695
Hey, so I did a data pull

19:21.697 --> 19:23.196
on Dr. DuPont's hospital
desktop computer

19:23.198 --> 19:26.800
to see what she was working on
after hours.

19:26.802 --> 19:28.201
So, she's doing
Internet searches

19:28.203 --> 19:29.469
on five different people.

19:29.471 --> 19:30.637
All she had to go on

19:30.639 --> 19:31.805
were their names.

19:31.807 --> 19:33.140
She could only find
information on one person.

19:33.142 --> 19:34.808
Walter Russell.

19:34.810 --> 19:36.243
So, he was never
convicted of a crime,

19:36.245 --> 19:38.145
but he was charged

19:38.147 --> 19:41.181
with felony official misconduct
back in '75 when he was a warden

19:41.183 --> 19:43.183
of the Wailea Reform School.

19:43.185 --> 19:44.251
Wait a minute, '75?

19:44.253 --> 19:46.119
Russell was a warden
while Tahni was there.

19:47.623 --> 19:50.257
Well, state investigators
were called in

19:50.259 --> 19:52.826
after complaints
of kids being abused

19:52.828 --> 19:54.327
and living under
horrible conditions.

19:54.329 --> 19:55.862
So, it wasn't enough
to Russell to trial,

19:55.864 --> 19:57.798
but he was forced to resign.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.367
And a year later, the school
was shut down for good.

20:00.369 --> 20:02.903
So, Tahni's on
his deathbed.

20:02.905 --> 20:04.805
He's got no one,
and Dr. DuPont

20:04.807 --> 20:08.108
is the first person to even
treat the guy like a human being

20:08.110 --> 20:10.077
in years, so he has
his come-to-Jesus moment

20:10.079 --> 20:11.745
before he finally
checks out for good.

20:11.747 --> 20:14.247
<i>He decides to spill the beans</i>
<i>about something that happened</i>

20:14.249 --> 20:15.816
<i>in reform school back</i>
<i>in the day.</i>

20:15.818 --> 20:17.918
<i> And the doctor</i>
<i>reaches out to Russell,</i>

20:17.920 --> 20:20.720
<i>not realizing he's involved,</i>
<i>and Russell clips them both.</i>

20:20.722 --> 20:22.823
- That's a theory.
- It's more than that, actually,

20:22.825 --> 20:25.392
'cause Dr. DuPont placed a call
from her cell phone

20:25.394 --> 20:26.493
to Russell's house
two days ago,

20:26.495 --> 20:28.061
and they talked
for a few minutes.

20:28.063 --> 20:30.363
Yeah, the cell phone that was
never found at the crime scene.

20:30.365 --> 20:32.232
Her husband said she kept it
with her all the time.

20:32.234 --> 20:33.400
Well, that means
whoever killed her

20:33.402 --> 20:34.901
took that cell phone
trying to cover their tracks.

20:34.903 --> 20:36.303
Fong pinged the phone.

20:36.305 --> 20:37.537
It's been turned off.

20:37.539 --> 20:38.972
Well, I have the carrier pulling

20:38.974 --> 20:41.007
files and records
from the cloud.

20:41.009 --> 20:42.909
All right, give me
a last known address on Russell.

20:42.911 --> 20:44.978
Let's dig a little deeper
into these other four names

20:44.980 --> 20:47.013
that Dr. DuPont
was researching.

20:47.015 --> 20:48.748
Maybe Russell
wasn't acting alone.

20:54.590 --> 20:56.790
How bad is your car?

20:56.792 --> 21:00.127
It's bad.

21:01.930 --> 21:04.197
Scale of one to ten?

21:04.199 --> 21:06.366
Don't do this.

21:06.368 --> 21:07.567
What am I doing?

21:07.569 --> 21:09.469
Don't trivialize my suffering.

21:09.471 --> 21:12.973
What? I'm gauging the damage of
that piece of junk car of yours.

21:12.975 --> 21:15.876
You just did it again.
You just did it again.

21:15.878 --> 21:17.444
All right.

21:17.446 --> 21:19.045
Talk about something else.

21:19.047 --> 21:21.815
Let's talk about something
that you are more familiar with.

21:21.817 --> 21:23.517
Like, uh, child endangerment,
let's talk about that.

21:23.519 --> 21:24.651
Okay.

21:24.653 --> 21:25.952
I wouldn't have left
your daughter

21:25.954 --> 21:27.787
if you'd have been doing
your job as a father.

21:27.789 --> 21:28.989
How about that?

21:28.991 --> 21:30.991
Wow, okay.
I don't like to run.

21:30.993 --> 21:32.459
All right?

21:32.461 --> 21:34.361
Who doesn't like to run?

21:34.363 --> 21:36.163
I said I don't like to run.

21:36.165 --> 21:38.064
It's a rhetorical
question.

21:47.376 --> 21:49.242
♪ ♪

22:12.968 --> 22:14.568
Whoa.

22:14.570 --> 22:16.336
What is that? I hate it when
you do that. What is that?

22:16.338 --> 22:18.505
You would have hated this more.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.113
Ah, I see.

22:27.115 --> 22:28.248
You're welcome.

22:28.250 --> 22:29.549
Lou,

22:29.551 --> 22:31.117
I got a booby trap.

22:31.119 --> 22:32.686
This guy doesn't like company.

22:32.688 --> 22:34.221
Copy that.

22:39.528 --> 22:40.860
You're not kidding.

22:46.635 --> 22:49.669
Drop the gun.

22:49.671 --> 22:51.938
My man, just relax.

22:51.940 --> 22:53.173
Shut up.
Relax.

22:53.175 --> 22:55.609
You are
trespassing, sir.

22:55.611 --> 22:57.310
Yes, technically,
you're right.

22:57.312 --> 22:58.645
But I'm a cop.

22:58.647 --> 23:01.314
So that cancels
your no visitors policy.

23:01.316 --> 23:02.682
What are you
doing here, cop?

23:02.684 --> 23:05.785
I just want to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Russell.

23:05.787 --> 23:07.387
Just some questions.

23:09.258 --> 23:11.324
Oh, it's the lady doctor.

23:11.326 --> 23:12.659
That's what this
is about, right?

23:12.661 --> 23:13.893
Hmm?

23:13.895 --> 23:15.762
She should have just
left it alone.

23:15.764 --> 23:19.633
It was none of her business.
It was none of her business!

23:19.635 --> 23:21.701
Did I tell you they
ruined my life, huh?

23:21.703 --> 23:22.902
They ruined it.

23:22.904 --> 23:24.504
But that wasn't
enough for her, no.

23:24.506 --> 23:25.438
Wasn't enough!

23:25.440 --> 23:27.574
Not for her.

23:27.576 --> 23:29.442
She couldn't
just let it sit.

23:29.444 --> 23:31.011
She had to
hurt me, huh?

23:31.013 --> 23:33.546
She loved to hurt.

23:33.548 --> 23:35.515
You didn't come
alone, did you?

23:35.517 --> 23:37.951
How many?

23:37.953 --> 23:40.120
Enough to make sure
that when this thing ends,

23:40.122 --> 23:42.789
you get dragged out of here
in a body bag.

23:45.961 --> 23:47.894
Make them go away.

23:47.896 --> 23:49.429
Gentlemen!

23:49.431 --> 23:50.664
Gentlemen,
let's just step back.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.699
Mr. Russell just
wants to talk.

23:52.701 --> 23:54.267
So everybody chill.

23:54.269 --> 23:57.103
Let's hear what
he's got to say.

23:57.105 --> 23:58.605
You make them go away.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.751
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

24:12.387 --> 24:14.187
What are you doing?

24:16.825 --> 24:20.327
You're welcome. Again.

24:27.642 --> 24:31.144
One, two, three. Lift.

24:31.146 --> 24:32.812
You know,
for some very strange reason--

24:32.814 --> 24:34.848
I don't know why--
this whole thing

24:34.850 --> 24:37.650
reminds me of an Easter egg hunt
that we had at Steve's.

24:37.652 --> 24:41.521
I could not find, uh, this egg
that I hid for Grace.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.290
Well, in this case,
the consequences

24:44.292 --> 24:46.192
seem slightly more dire.

25:02.944 --> 25:03.944
Hey.

25:03.945 --> 25:04.911
Yeah.

25:04.913 --> 25:06.779
"Chlorprozamine."

25:06.781 --> 25:08.481
So Russell was either bipolar,
schizophrenic or both.

25:08.483 --> 25:10.250
Either way, the guy
was off his meds.

25:10.252 --> 25:11.985
This bottle hasn't
been touched.

25:11.987 --> 25:14.020
Prescription was filled
a few months ago.

25:14.022 --> 25:16.222
Well, he seemed pretty sane
rambling about Dr. DuPont

25:16.224 --> 25:18.258
when he had that shotgun
leveled at your head.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.226
Well, he was ready for us.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.862
Whatever DuPont was digging
around for, he knew what it was.

25:22.864 --> 25:24.497
All right, look, these were
two well-planned murders.

25:24.499 --> 25:26.799
A guy in his mental state,
living the way he did,

25:26.801 --> 25:29.035
there's no way he had
the capacity to pull them off.

25:29.037 --> 25:30.370
Hey.

25:30.372 --> 25:33.540
So HPD just spoke to one
of the neighbors up the block.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.241
She went driving by
earlier this morning

25:35.243 --> 25:36.876
and saw Russell
working in the yard

25:36.878 --> 25:38.945
about the same time
that the doc was murdered.

25:38.947 --> 25:41.381
All right, look, we need to dig
deeper into Russell's life.

25:41.383 --> 25:43.550
But if he didn't pull
the trigger on Dr. DuPont,

25:43.552 --> 25:45.451
I bet he knew who did.

25:45.453 --> 25:46.786
Kono, what do you got?

25:46.788 --> 25:50.256
<i> Dr. DuPont used</i>
<i>a voice memo app on her phone</i>

25:50.258 --> 25:51.357
to record patient notes.

25:51.359 --> 25:52.859
I recovered those audio files
from the cloud.

25:52.861 --> 25:54.594
Most of it is
just doctor-patient

25:54.596 --> 25:55.895
related stuff,
but about a week ago,

25:55.897 --> 25:58.731
she recorded this conversation
between her and Tahni.

25:58.733 --> 26:01.668
I was born nothing,
and I'm gonna die nothing.

26:01.670 --> 26:03.870
That's not true, Mr. Tahni.

26:03.872 --> 26:06.339
You might have made
some bad choices in life,

26:06.341 --> 26:08.074
but everybody's life
has meaning.

26:08.076 --> 26:10.777
No.

26:10.779 --> 26:13.413
No, I'm a bad person, Doc.

26:13.415 --> 26:15.315
I done some horrible things.

26:15.317 --> 26:18.017
Most of my life,

26:18.019 --> 26:21.454
I didn't give a damn
about nobody.

26:21.456 --> 26:26.392
But I liked those four boys
I told you about.

26:26.394 --> 26:28.995
They looked out for me.

26:28.997 --> 26:32.999
They wasn't rotten
like most of us in there.

26:33.001 --> 26:36.069
They steal is all.

26:36.071 --> 26:38.638
Mostly 'cause
they didn't have nothing

26:38.640 --> 26:40.640
and no family
to keep them right.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.376
I'm sorry, Mr. Tahni,
but I don't understand

26:43.378 --> 26:45.111
why you're telling
me all this.

26:45.113 --> 26:48.314
Or why you want me to
record our conversation.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.150
For proof.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.519
Proof of what?

26:55.323 --> 26:57.323
I never had nobody
I could trust.

26:59.995 --> 27:03.129
You can trust me.

27:03.131 --> 27:05.565
Did something happen
to those boys?

27:05.567 --> 27:09.969
I'm pretty sure
they were murdered.

27:09.971 --> 27:12.472
<i> The four boys</i>
<i>that he's talking about</i>

27:12.474 --> 27:15.675
are the same four names
that Dr. DuPont was researching.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.176
Exactly.

27:17.178 --> 27:19.178
They were all juvenile offenders
locked up with Tahni

27:19.180 --> 27:22.682
in the Wailea Reform School
back in the '70s.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.852
According to the tapes, the four
boys escaped from the school

27:25.854 --> 27:28.254
back in June of 1974.

27:28.256 --> 27:29.589
They stole a car

27:29.591 --> 27:30.890
that was belonging
to one of the guards,

27:30.892 --> 27:32.458
and then they burglarized
a bunch of homes

27:32.460 --> 27:33.960
on the other side of the island.

27:33.962 --> 27:35.094
The car was recovered,

27:35.096 --> 27:37.030
but the boys were
supposedly never found.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.498
What do you mean,
"supposedly"?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
<i> Well, the night</i>
<i>after they escaped,</i>

27:40.502 --> 27:42.669
<i>Tahni woke up to some noise</i>
<i>outside his window.</i>

27:42.671 --> 27:44.070
Shut up and keep moving.

27:44.072 --> 27:47.040
<i>He saw the boys being led</i>
<i>across the yard, shackled,</i>

27:47.042 --> 27:49.108
<i>into a basement dungeon</i>
<i>that the guards used</i>

27:49.110 --> 27:50.410
<i>as solitary confinement.</i>

27:50.412 --> 27:52.412
<i>They were being led there</i>
<i>by a guard</i>

27:52.414 --> 27:53.813
that Tahni only knew
by his nickname:

27:53.815 --> 27:55.114
"Huhu."

27:55.116 --> 27:56.215
"Angry."

27:56.217 --> 27:57.583
Ah.

27:57.585 --> 28:00.319
A story about a prison guard
named "Angry" does not end well.

28:00.321 --> 28:01.421
It doesn't.

28:01.423 --> 28:02.588
At first,
Tahni didn't think much

28:02.590 --> 28:04.023
of the boys
being led to solitary.

28:04.025 --> 28:06.025
It was just
normal punishment.

28:06.027 --> 28:07.994
But then a few nights later,
he overheard an argument

28:07.996 --> 28:09.028
between Huhu and another man

28:09.030 --> 28:10.430
that he thought
could have been Russell.

28:10.432 --> 28:12.932
Well, what if someone
saw you bringing them back?

28:12.934 --> 28:14.434
Trust me, no one did.

28:14.436 --> 28:16.636
What do we say
if the family comes around

28:16.638 --> 28:17.970
asking about them?

28:17.972 --> 28:20.406
They won't.
And even they did, they escaped.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.908
Simple as that.

28:21.910 --> 28:25.011
You can't just make
four boys disappear.

28:25.013 --> 28:26.379
I already did.

28:26.381 --> 28:29.282
<i> Tahni never saw</i>
<i>those boys again.</i>

28:31.052 --> 28:32.452
This guy,

28:32.454 --> 28:35.788
Alex Mackey, was the one
that everyone called Huhu.

28:35.790 --> 28:38.124
He was the guard on duty
the night the boys escaped.

28:38.126 --> 28:40.093
It was his car that they stole.

28:40.095 --> 28:42.729
And he was the last one
to see those boys alive.

28:42.731 --> 28:45.598
Sounds like he was the first
one to see them dead, too.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.433
Yeah. It actually gets better.

28:48.369 --> 28:49.969
So, after the school shut down,

28:49.971 --> 28:52.472
Mackey went to work
at Kuakini Medical Center

28:52.474 --> 28:55.241
as a maintenance man for the
next 36 years until he retired

28:55.243 --> 28:57.076
in 2011.
Okay, that explains

28:57.078 --> 28:59.078
how he, uh, knew his way
around the hospital

28:59.080 --> 29:01.147
and had access
to Dr. DuPont's schedule.

29:01.149 --> 29:02.515
There's no
public record

29:02.517 --> 29:03.649
of any of those boys

29:03.651 --> 29:05.251
beyond the night
they escaped from the school.

29:05.253 --> 29:06.519
It's like they just dropped off

29:06.521 --> 29:08.054
the face of the earth
after that night.

29:08.056 --> 29:10.123
All right,
so Tahni heard Russell say,

29:10.125 --> 29:13.459
"You can't just make
four kids disappear."

29:13.461 --> 29:16.696
There's a chance their bodies
never left those grounds.

29:39.354 --> 29:40.787
Busy day.

29:40.789 --> 29:42.588
Murder in the morning,
school pickups

29:42.590 --> 29:44.857
- in the afternoon.
- Poppy!

29:44.859 --> 29:46.926
Hey, kiddo, how was school?

29:46.928 --> 29:49.162
Alex Mackey.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.230
Alex Mackey, come with me.
What are you doing?

29:51.232 --> 29:52.632
Take it easy.
Come on.

29:52.634 --> 29:54.400
Not in front of the kids.
That's my grandson.

29:54.402 --> 29:56.035
That's your grandson?
Hey, look at me.

29:56.037 --> 29:57.870
There's two kids up at
Diamond Head right now,

29:57.872 --> 29:59.639
and their mother's not coming home
for dinner, you son of a bitch.

29:59.641 --> 30:01.507
Now come on.
Come on, Huhu.

30:03.344 --> 30:08.848
So, you are a very special,
special tough guy, right?

30:08.850 --> 30:11.417
I mean, you go after,
uh, an innocent mother,

30:11.419 --> 30:13.753
a respected doctor,

30:13.755 --> 30:15.521
bunch of defenseless kids,

30:15.523 --> 30:17.757
guy with cancer
on his deathbed.

30:17.759 --> 30:19.158
You ever go after anybody
who actually

30:19.160 --> 30:20.126
could defend themselves?

30:20.128 --> 30:22.161
You would be my first.

30:22.163 --> 30:23.563
Okay.

30:28.603 --> 30:30.603
Why don't you do
yourself a favor, Alex,

30:30.605 --> 30:31.871
make it easy on yourself.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.806
We know what you did.
We know why you did it.

30:33.808 --> 30:36.309
We just want to know where,
that's all.

30:36.311 --> 30:39.245
It's over, you understand?
Where are the bodies?

30:39.247 --> 30:41.514
It's not over.
You got nothing on me.

30:41.516 --> 30:44.050
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

30:45.753 --> 30:47.520
You got no witnesses,

30:47.522 --> 30:49.388
no proof
that I killed the doctor,

30:49.390 --> 30:53.159
that-that punk murderer,
those kids-- nothing.

30:53.161 --> 30:55.127
Go ahead,
search my house,

30:55.129 --> 30:58.164
search my car,
search whatever you like.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.532
You won't find nothing.

30:59.534 --> 31:02.034
Look, I don't think
you understand something, okay?

31:02.036 --> 31:03.669
That woman
that you murdered,

31:03.671 --> 31:05.738
she's no different
than your daughter, okay?

31:05.740 --> 31:06.772
She's got a husband,

31:06.774 --> 31:09.709
she has kids the same age
as your grandson.

31:09.711 --> 31:12.912
That's a very sad story,
Detective.

31:14.682 --> 31:17.717
Sounds like she owed it
to those kids

31:17.719 --> 31:21.520
to mind her own damn business.

31:21.522 --> 31:24.357
Maybe she'd be alive
if she still did.

31:27.962 --> 31:30.363
Yeah, Kono,
what do you got?

31:32.500 --> 31:34.200
Is that right?

31:35.570 --> 31:37.570
No, that's great. Listen.

You should hang on to

pretty sure the next call I get

stupid smirk off your face

The prints from

Nahele.

33:38.735 --> 33:42.303
I have to call your parents,

Yes, Commander.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.542
I'm sorry.

34:21.543 --> 34:24.178

34:34.824 --> 34:37.690
How long you been
on the street?

34:37.693 --> 34:40.628
A few months.

34:40.630 --> 34:44.598
They tried to put me in one of
those homes after my mom died,

34:44.600 --> 34:46.500
but I couldn't
stay there.

34:46.502 --> 34:49.036

35:14.630 --> 35:16.964
Copy that.

35:16.966 --> 35:20.167
<i> Commander,</i>
<i>after a thorough examination,</i>

35:20.169 --> 35:22.169
I've determined that
each of our young victims

35:22.171 --> 35:24.705
were suffering from acute
dehydration and starvation

35:24.707 --> 35:26.207
in the days leading up to

35:26.209 --> 35:27.842
and at the time of their deaths.

35:27.844 --> 35:29.577
Take a look at this.

35:29.579 --> 35:30.744
The week they disappeared was

35:30.746 --> 35:32.213
one of the hottest
on record for Oahu.

35:32.215 --> 35:36.183
Daytime temps hovered in the
mid-90s for five straight days.

35:36.185 --> 35:38.118
And...

35:38.120 --> 35:39.820
this is the basement
that the school used

35:39.822 --> 35:40.822
as solitary confinement.

35:40.823 --> 35:41.755
The same one

35:41.757 --> 35:43.090
<i>that Tahni saw the boys being</i>

35:43.092 --> 35:44.792
<i>led into the night</i>
<i>they returned.</i>

35:44.794 --> 35:47.228
No windows, no ventilation.

35:47.230 --> 35:48.996
Must have been
unbearable down there.

35:48.998 --> 35:50.698
<i>In that kind of heat,</i>

35:50.700 --> 35:52.900
<i>left in a poorly ventilated</i>
<i>space, without food or water</i>

35:52.902 --> 35:54.935
<i>for a significant</i>
<i>amount of time would be</i>

35:54.937 --> 35:56.203
<i>equivalent to leaving an infant</i>

35:56.205 --> 35:57.972
<i>in a car</i>
<i>with a rolled-up window</i>

35:57.974 --> 35:59.006
in the middle of the summer.

35:59.008 --> 36:01.275
As a result
of all these findings,

36:01.277 --> 36:02.810
I'm listing
the official cause of death

36:02.812 --> 36:04.078
as homicide.

36:10.653 --> 36:13.420
Place sucks, huh?

36:13.422 --> 36:15.589
Enjoy it 'cause
it's, uh, the Ritz-Carlton

36:15.591 --> 36:17.424

where you're going.

36:17.426 --> 36:20.027
See, we found those boys
up at that school.

36:20.029 --> 36:22.363
We also found
enough evidence

36:22.365 --> 36:25.065
to throw your sorry ass
in Halawa

36:25.067 --> 36:28.269
for the rest
of your life.

36:28.271 --> 36:29.970
You didn't even have the decency
to take the shackles

36:29.972 --> 36:33.274
off those kids
before you buried them.

36:33.276 --> 36:34.808
Huhu?

36:36.679 --> 36:39.647
We're not bluffing.

36:42.485 --> 36:45.319
Nobody gave a rat's ass
about those kids.

36:45.321 --> 36:46.787
Nobody!

36:46.789 --> 36:49.056
But that nosy doctor
couldn't leave it alone.

36:49.058 --> 36:50.891
It was over.

36:50.893 --> 36:52.526
Forgotten about! Done!

36:52.528 --> 36:55.262
No, you're wrong, actually.

36:55.264 --> 36:57.231
You see, Tahni remembered,
and for the first time

36:57.233 --> 37:00.668
in his miserable life,
he decided to do something good.

37:00.670 --> 37:02.703
Piece of garbage.

37:02.705 --> 37:05.673
Useless, worthless punk.

37:08.978 --> 37:11.378
You know the world is a better
place without those kids.

37:11.380 --> 37:12.913
You know it is!

37:12.915 --> 37:16.317
I don't know... I don't know
about that, but what I do know

37:16.319 --> 37:19.486
is that you are
going to die in prison,

37:19.488 --> 37:21.889
a "useless,
worthless punk"

37:21.891 --> 37:24.625
that I'm pretty sure
nobody cares about.

37:24.627 --> 37:27.594
I'm done.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.917
Thanks, Pua.

37:55.958 --> 37:59.026

for felony grand larceny auto,

38:02.798 --> 38:05.799
charging you with
the theft of my car.

38:05.801 --> 38:07.901
I-I understand, sir. And...

38:07.903 --> 38:09.536
when I get out of jail,

38:09.538 --> 38:10.838
promise I'll pay you back...

38:10.840 --> 38:13.440
Hold on, hold on.
I'm not done.

38:15.211 --> 38:18.579
The only thing missing
from this is my signature.

38:26.589 --> 38:29.323

the deal of a lifetime.

38:30.793 --> 38:32.960
All right?

38:35.965 --> 38:38.032
This is what's gonna happen.

38:38.034 --> 38:40.434
First, we're gonna go
to all the body shops,

38:40.436 --> 38:42.503
get back all the parts
you sold off.

38:42.505 --> 38:44.104
And then you and me,

38:44.106 --> 38:46.306
we're gonna put my car back
together exactly the way it was

38:46.308 --> 38:47.274
before you took it.

38:47.276 --> 38:49.276
As long as you keep
your nose clean,

38:49.278 --> 38:52.513
this complaint stays
in my drawer, unsigned.
