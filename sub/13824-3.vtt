01:56.574 --> 02:00.036
Red hots. Get your red hots.
Red hots, here.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.677
Red hots. Huh?

02:16.010 --> 02:17.887
Hot diggity dog.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.348
A winning lotto ticket.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.853
This is my lucky day. Whoo-hoo!

03:12.317 --> 03:14.277
Thanks, chump.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.412
Don't spend it all in one place.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.900
You, my friend, are a musical genius.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.693
Break a leg, mousy boy.

04:19.050 --> 04:23.763
You wanna trade?
Boy, this is my lucky day.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.001
Hey, look.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.045
Oh, it's a street-performer cat.

04:56.045 --> 05:00.049
Oh, I've never seen
anything like it. Let's watch.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.653
Well, howdy there, nephew.

15:45.653 --> 15:50.449
It's your picking, singing,
guitar-slinging Uncle Pecos.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.535
Hope it ain't a bad time.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.302
Your Auntie Spinner
done throwed me out, son.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.806
You gotta put me up, that's all.

16:15.557 --> 16:19.978
My poor heart's all done and broke.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.177
You know, that there
was your auntie's favorite song.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.041
Hey, kitty-kitty.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.755
Give me some more
of them fingerpicks.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.343
Now, where'd he get to?

17:38.932 --> 17:43.437
Ha! There you are, you kitty-cat, you.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.408
Let go of my tail, nephew.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.267
Rise and shine, fellers.
Hoo-hoo!

18:22.267 --> 18:27.272
I call this tootin' tune
"Morning Nervous Breakdown."

18:34.029 --> 18:35.197
Hey.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.949
No.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.952
My guitar.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.621
Hey, you gotta let it go, see.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.290
Give it back, is what I'm saying.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.966
Hey, I'm warning you, pussycat.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.635
You don't know
who you're messing with.

19:18.740 --> 19:23.328
Take your paws off my property.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.498
I ain't gonna tell you twice, kitty.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.187
Oh, you're killing me, you galoot.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.690
Stop it.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.192
No.

19:54.192 --> 19:57.195
Don't do it, son.
You can't, that's all.

20:01.950 --> 20:07.039
What I ever done to you, kitty-cat?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.526
Let me at that septic tank.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.084
Now that's just good luck.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.462
It came out in better tune
than it went in.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.950
Pecos.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.286
Spinner, my darling.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.498
All is forgiven, sugar-dump.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.292
Why don't you come on home?

21:35.293 --> 21:38.463
Hey, let's give my nephew...

21:38.463 --> 21:41.925
...and his kitty a duet.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.157
Yee-haw!
