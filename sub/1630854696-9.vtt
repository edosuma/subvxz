That's the same NOPD

that swore up and down
that my client

16:28.500 --> 16:29.730
was a killer,

16:30.660 --> 16:33.270
and then swore up and down

16:33.510 --> 16:35.580
that they'd found his dead body.

16:36.940 --> 16:37.840
And just like that,

16:37.840 --> 16:40.570
the Baxter House shooting

24:30.400 --> 24:32.410
That's when I saw him
raise his gun.

24:33.510 --> 24:36.000
And he aimed for my son Carlo.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.020
And he aimed for my son Carlo.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.600
And then he fired.

24:41.390 --> 24:42.000
I thought for sure Carlo was

24:42.000 --> 24:43.490
I thought for sure Carlo was

24:43.490 --> 24:45.980
about to be murdered
right in front of me.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.850
But God spared him.

24:50.433 --> 24:52.352
[sighs]

24:52.530 --> 24:54.000
And then I realized that
Adam Desiato was hit.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.010
And then I realized that
Adam Desiato was hit.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.080
My daughter, Fia,

24:58.080 --> 25:00.000
tried desperately to save him.

25:00.000 --> 25:00.510
tried desperately to save him.

25:02.870 --> 25:05.150
[Jarek] Mrs. Baxter,
did you see anything else?

25:05.900 --> 25:06.000
I saw the shooter
drop his gun and run away.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.200
I saw the shooter
drop his gun and run away.

25:09.590 --> 25:12.000
And can you identify the shooter
that you saw that night?

25:12.000 --> 25:12.200
And can you identify the shooter
that you saw that night?

25:12.230 --> 25:13.190
Yes.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.110
[Jarek]
Is he in this courtroom today?

25:16.120 --> 25:17.770
It was the defendant,

25:18.130 --> 25:19.600
Eugene Jones.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.620
[Jarek]
Are you sure?

25:21.860 --> 25:22.940
I'm positive.

25:24.670 --> 25:27.010
Thank you, Mrs. Baxter.
No more questions.

25:33.050 --> 25:34.160
[Lee]
Mrs. Baxter,

25:34.190 --> 25:36.000
what did you do when you saw

25:36.000 --> 25:36.040
what did you do when you saw

25:36.140 --> 25:39.680
the, uh, the "dark figure"
with the gun?

25:40.100 --> 25:42.000
Did you, uh, did you call out
to your son, Carlo?

25:42.000 --> 25:42.590
Did you, uh, did you call out
to your son, Carlo?

25:42.620 --> 25:43.700
Did you warn him?

25:44.580 --> 25:47.010
I don't think there was time
to say anything.

25:49.170 --> 25:52.320
In which hand was the, uh,
"dark figure" holding the gun?

25:52.870 --> 25:53.970
I don't recall.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.380
[Lee]
Was it dimly lit?

25:57.090 --> 25:58.290
Not too dark to see.

25:59.470 --> 26:00.000
You said you were celebrating
your son's acquittal.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.080
You said you were celebrating
your son's acquittal.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.690
He'd been found not guilty?

26:04.810 --> 26:06.000
-That's correct.
-Of what crime?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.220
-That's correct.
-Of what crime?

26:07.240 --> 26:10.180
He had been falsely accused
of murder.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.000
Who was the deceased?

26:12.000 --> 26:12.430
Who was the deceased?

26:12.580 --> 26:14.110
[Gina]
He'd been charged with,

26:14.120 --> 26:17.110
uh, killing a convict
named Kofi Jones.

26:17.170 --> 26:18.000
-[Lee] "Falsely," though?
-Correct.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.300
-[Lee] "Falsely," though?
-Correct.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.180
So, your son didn't kill Kofi?

26:23.020 --> 26:24.000
He didn't murder him.
It was self-defense.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.840
He didn't murder him.
It was self-defense.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.130
I see. So, he did kill Kofi,

26:28.150 --> 26:30.000
the older brother
of Eugene Jones, and

26:30.000 --> 26:30.970
the older brother
of Eugene Jones, and

26:30.970 --> 26:33.040
this was a celebration because
he'd gotten away with it?

26:33.070 --> 26:35.530
-Objection. Argumentative.
-[Judge Doucet] Sustained.

26:36.550 --> 26:38.470
Where did Kofi's murder occur?

26:38.500 --> 26:41.080
-Objection. Argumentative.
-[Judge Doucet] Sustained.

26:41.190 --> 26:42.000
Counselor, choose your words

26:42.000 --> 26:43.840
Counselor, choose your words

26:43.840 --> 26:46.450
and your tone carefully.

26:51.370 --> 26:54.000
Where did this killing
in self-defense occur?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.030
Where did this killing
in self-defense occur?

26:55.420 --> 26:57.190
In Orleans Parish Prison.

26:57.670 --> 26:59.230
[Lee]
Why was Carlo in OPP?

26:59.410 --> 27:00.000
He'd been incarcerated because
of a physical altercation.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.480
He'd been incarcerated because
of a physical altercation.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.630
-[Lee] He'd gotten into a fight?
-That's right.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.000
-Was he hurt?
-[Gina] He survived.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.600
-Was he hurt?
-[Gina] He survived.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.050
And, uh, the other guy
that he fought?

27:11.540 --> 27:12.000
Uh, he sustained
some injuries as well.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.870
Uh, he sustained
some injuries as well.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.880
[Lee]
Isn't he permanently disabled?

27:15.880 --> 27:18.000
-So he says.
-[Lee] And for beating this man

27:18.000 --> 27:18.100
-So he says.
-[Lee] And for beating this man

27:18.100 --> 27:20.080
to the point
of permanent disability,

27:20.110 --> 27:22.990
Carlo was sentenced
to a Louisiana state prison?

27:22.990 --> 27:23.650
Yes.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.800
[Lee] So, why was he
in a New Orleans jail

27:26.830 --> 27:28.510
prior to his release?

27:33.080 --> 27:35.420
He was transferred so...

27:35.420 --> 27:36.000
he could attend
his little brother's funeral.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.470
he could attend
his little brother's funeral.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.710
How did your youngest son die?

27:46.730 --> 27:48.000
He was hit and killed by a car.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.650
He was hit and killed by a car.

27:50.510 --> 27:53.240
Was anyone charged
with a crime in his death?

27:53.270 --> 27:54.000
-Yes.
-[Lee] Who?

27:54.000 --> 27:54.950
-Yes.
-[Lee] Who?

27:54.980 --> 27:56.000
Kofi Jones.

27:56.450 --> 27:58.520
The young man Carlo killed?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.000
The young man who attacked
Carlo in Carlo's jail cell.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.750
The young man who attacked
Carlo in Carlo's jail cell.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.240
How did Carlo end up
in the same jail as Kofi?

28:05.270 --> 28:06.000
-I just told you that.
-No, you told me

28:06.000 --> 28:07.850
-I just told you that.
-No, you told me

28:07.850 --> 28:09.736
why Carlo was in OPP.

28:09.860 --> 28:12.000
I'm asking you how
he came to be there.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.080
I'm asking you how
he came to be there.

28:12.110 --> 28:14.930
He was granted a transfer
so he could attend

28:14.930 --> 28:16.490
his little brother's funeral.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.000
Who made the request
for that transfer?

28:18.000 --> 28:18.230
Who made the request
for that transfer?

28:18.260 --> 28:18.920
I did.

28:19.220 --> 28:21.230
-To whom?
-The warden.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.240
That's a pretty big request.

28:23.270 --> 28:24.000
You drove all the way out
to the state penitentiary

28:24.000 --> 28:25.850
You drove all the way out
to the state penitentiary

28:25.880 --> 28:29.010
to personally ask
the warden for a favor?

28:29.030 --> 28:30.000
I would do anything for my son.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.710
I would do anything for my son.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.340
Except take a bullet for him.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.290
Objection! Argumentative.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.000
-[Judge Doucet] Sustained.
-[Lee] Mrs. Baxter,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.120
-[Judge Doucet] Sustained.
-[Lee] Mrs. Baxter,

28:37.120 --> 28:40.450
if you saw a gun pointed
at Carlo, why didn't you react?

28:40.450 --> 28:42.000
React faster
than a speeding bullet?

28:42.000 --> 28:42.400
React faster
than a speeding bullet?

28:42.430 --> 28:44.620
You didn't even try
to get in between

28:44.620 --> 28:46.360
your child and the attacker?

28:46.390 --> 28:48.000
-I would die for my child.
-[Lee] I believe you.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.160
-I would die for my child.
-[Lee] I believe you.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.700
Which is why I'm having
a hard time understanding why,

28:51.700 --> 28:53.680
with a gun pointed at Carlo,

28:53.710 --> 28:54.000
you didn't react at all.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.750
you didn't react at all.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.200
Unless, you didn't see the gun

28:59.200 --> 29:00.000
because you didn't see
the shooter.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.810
because you didn't see
the shooter.

Members of the jury,

-Your Honor.
-[Judge Doucet] Yes, Mr. Rall?

29:38.580 --> 29:40.470
The State moves to amend

29:40.500 --> 29:42.000
the witness list.
I would like to add a name,

29:42.000 --> 29:43.050
the witness list.
I would like to add a name,

Th-This is ridiculous.

29:49.460 --> 29:52.310
We've had weeks
to change that list.

29:52.310 --> 29:53.390
To do so now,

29:53.390 --> 29:54.000
is a ploy on behalf
of the State.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.640

30:08.430 --> 30:10.890
Mr. Rall, tell me why
I should entertain

30:10.890 --> 30:12.000
your motion to amend
at this time?

30:12.000 --> 30:12.570
your motion to amend
at this time?

30:12.570 --> 30:15.050
Mr. Desiato is a unique witness.

30:15.060 --> 30:16.210
That's one way to put it.

30:16.230 --> 30:18.000
It had been my hope
to avoid calling him.

30:18.000 --> 30:18.360
It had been my hope

of my job is.

preview Mr. Desiato's
testimony for me.

He's the father of the victim,
he can speak to who Adam was,

30:45.270 --> 30:47.100
and he was at the hotel
that night.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.000
Potentially, he was
an eyewitness to the shooting.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.770
Potentially, he was
an eyewitness to the shooting.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.140
What do you mean "potentially"?

30:52.170 --> 30:54.000
Well, I tried to speak to him,
but he was reluctant to talk.

Well, I tried to speak to him,
but he was reluctant to talk.

30:55.260 --> 30:57.210
But I do believe
he saw the shooter.

He's the surviving father
of the victim.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.000
The jury has a right
to hear from him.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.960
The jury has a right

Yet, you didn't always want

31:18.000 --> 31:18.830
that testimony from a mobster's
friends and family

31:18.830 --> 31:21.770
might not come across
as particularly trustworthy.

And so, in a last act
of desperation,

31:24.000 --> 31:24.590
And so, in a last act
of desperation,
