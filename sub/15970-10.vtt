00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
(theme music playing)

01:10.160 --> 01:14.440
(Rayanne) Have you ever stopped to think
about, like, refrigerators?

01:15.520 --> 01:18.000
Refrigerators are so revealing.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.480
I can look in this refrigerator
and know everything about your family.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.400
Look at this. There's actual labels,
like, leftovers, in here.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.320
There's stuff in my fridge,
I never knew what it was.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.000
Could you close the fridge?

01:30.080 --> 01:33.640
My mother completely senses it
if the fridge rises over 47 degrees.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.280
-Who's into the mustard?
-Oh, my dad.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.720
Well, you know what that's about.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.800
(Angela)
<i>To Rayanne, everything is about...</i>

01:40.880 --> 01:41.960
Sex.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.240
I mean, all you really need
to survive is mild yellow.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.760
All this other stuff
is purely recreational.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.960
What? It's domestic.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.240
Even Patty has enough of a life,
she's not going to be counting beers.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.920
-Maybe we should eat in my room.
-Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.800
-Fine. Rickie, grab that for me.
-Sure.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.640
Think fast.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.360
In my refrigerator,
we got this mayonnaise jar

02:07.440 --> 02:10.160
that nobody wants to admit
is empty.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.200
I know. My mother does not throw
things away.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.120
-She's in denial about spoilage.
-You're drinking a beer? At 4:30.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.680
Danielle, go play outside.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.080
Mom, it's not fair.
My life is totally edited.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.800
-(Angela) Mom. Look...
-I'm really sorry.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.800
It... it won't happen again.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.560
(intense music playing)

02:37.640 --> 02:39.440
Look, I will not tolerate...

02:40.400 --> 02:42.600
under no circumstances...

02:44.240 --> 02:46.040
there are certain rules...

02:47.040 --> 02:50.160
(dramatic music playing)

02:51.240 --> 02:53.480
may I see you in the kitchen
for a moment, please?

02:53.560 --> 02:55.400
(dramatic music continues playing)

03:02.160 --> 03:03.480
Now she hates me.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.080
So? She never liked you much
to start off with.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.920
But now she really hates me.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.600
Look, do you think it's possible
to please that woman?

03:11.680 --> 03:13.840
Do you think she'd actually
give anyone a break?

03:15.240 --> 03:18.400
I mean, have you seen
her vegetable bin?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.080
I rest my case.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.480
Grandpa Chuck is back
in the hospital for tests.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.600
-(slams bottle)
-It's nothing to worry about.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.480
The doctors say he'll be out
by Saturday,

03:33.560 --> 03:36.680
so we won't have to call off the party.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.200
What party?

03:38.280 --> 03:40.920
Angela, I have mentioned this
at least a dozen times,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.160
grandma and grandpa's 45th
anniversary party

03:44.240 --> 03:48.440
-this Saturday at that Fondue restaurant.
-Oh, right.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.640
I hate fondue.
I'm always losing my bread.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.960
(Angela sighs)

03:55.040 --> 03:57.280
Don't let me catch you drinking
in this house again.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.120
-I wasn't drinking.
-You know what I mean.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
Okay.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.200
I know. Tomorrow I'll bring her
a beer to replace it.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.080
Tomorrow we're going to my house.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.240
(Angela) <i>I'd been friends with</i>
<i>Rayanne Graff for like half a year...</i>

04:15.240 --> 04:16.800
<i>but I'd never been to her house.</i>

04:19.520 --> 04:23.240
Mom, Rickie's here!
I hope you're at least wearing underwear.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.080
(Angela) <i>Walking into someone's</i>
<i>house for the first time...</i>

04:26.160 --> 04:29.400
-(bells jingling)
-(serene music playing)

04:29.480 --> 04:32.160
<i>is like entering another country.</i>

04:34.080 --> 04:36.000
<i>Not that I've ever been</i>
<i>to another country.</i>

04:36.080 --> 04:38.400
-(bells jingling)
-(serene music continues)

04:44.320 --> 04:46.200
(Rayanne's mother)
Raynnie... remember last week

04:46.280 --> 04:49.840
-when you got all those prosperity cards?
-Uh-huh.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.320
-Now, three guesses what I've got here.
-Oh, my God!

04:54.400 --> 04:59.360
-Money? From dad?
-I opened it. $270!

04:59.440 --> 05:01.240
-(bell rings)
-Oh, my!

05:01.320 --> 05:03.160
Oh! Oh!

05:04.800 --> 05:06.680
"Happy birthday
and maybe more. Dad."

05:06.760 --> 05:09.160
I know. I saw that.
He meant "many more."

05:09.240 --> 05:12.200
-He wrote, "and maybe more."
-Hi, sweetcakes.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.640
Hmm.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.400
-Oh, my God! Is that her?
-Yes.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.960
Aah! Angela... come to mama.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.600
(serene music playing)

05:33.120 --> 05:35.120
I've finally faced the truth.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.160
The only really great foods
are appetizers and desserts,

05:38.240 --> 05:39.880
so why bother eating anything else?

05:39.960 --> 05:42.920
Amber, you're so up, even though
you're surrounded by negativity.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.520
She's an x-ray technician.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.800
It's not as glamorous as it sounds.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.280
What can I tell you, sweetcakes?
Life was created to be lived.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.320
-(Rickie chuckles)
-Give me.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
So what, did you wear out
your welcome at Angela's house?

05:55.480 --> 06:00.600
-My mom's not that strict.
-You don't have to explain.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.920
See this card? That's the world.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.720
This is the daughter who hides
her feelings behind, like, a mask.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.600
That's her, big time.

06:09.680 --> 06:13.360
-But, I'm the daughter.
-Yeah, but so is she.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.160
See, my mom was adopted,
so she has, like, these...

06:19.960 --> 06:23.440
-abandonment issues.
-I've got those.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.600
Well, look right here.
See this card covering you?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.000
That's the moon.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.120
That's, like, the deadly mother...
like the wicked witch.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.080
-Well, should I be scared?
-That's nothing. Last time, I got death.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.920
That's one bitchin' card.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.920
But it doesn't have to mean death.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.080
-It means, one door opens, another closes.
-Yeah. In your face!

06:48.760 --> 06:50.280
You're having dinner with us,
right?

06:50.360 --> 06:53.000
-(telephone rings)
-Mother, just please relax.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.680
-I'll get it!
-I'll get it! Hello.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.760
-Hi! Where are you? It's Angela.
-Hi, honey!

06:58.840 --> 07:01.920
We were just visiting
grandpa at the hospital.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.920
No, sweetie, you can't have
dinner at Rayanne's.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.800
Because grandma's
having dinner here, and...

07:05.880 --> 07:09.280
-Let her stay at her friend's.
-Mom!

07:09.360 --> 07:11.560
(sighs) Okay. You can have
dinner at Rayanne's.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.200
Of course, I wouldn't mind if she chose
to come home. I never do see her.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.000
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.240
-What?
-Nothing.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.840
-I'm going to go pick her up.
-(sighs)

07:24.920 --> 07:27.320
What if I've made a terrible mistake?

07:27.400 --> 07:30.200
What if your father isn't well
enough by Saturday?

07:30.280 --> 07:35.400
That crowded, noisy restaurant.
All that fondue!

07:35.480 --> 07:38.720
What was I thinking?
The man is a diabetic!

07:38.800 --> 07:40.680
What if they prepare
one of the dishes incorrectly?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.560
I should call off the whole thing!
I should cancel the party!

07:43.640 --> 07:47.600
Maybe you should postpone
until he's feeling better.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.800
But everyone's looking forward.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.280
And the doctors predict he'll be out
by Friday. And you know daddy.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.000
If he hears I'm calling off the party,
it'll discourage him,

07:57.080 --> 07:59.000
and he's depressed enough as it is.

07:59.080 --> 08:04.720
But, mom, on the one hand, you're saying,
"how can we do this?"

08:04.800 --> 08:08.000
And on the other hand, you're saying,
"how can we not do this?"

08:08.080 --> 08:09.600
Exactly.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.840
If only we could
hold it someplace else,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.840
someplace where he would
feel more at home.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.760
A place like...

08:18.240 --> 08:19.400
here.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.480
Oh, but I couldn't do that. Oh, no.
Couldn't do that to you.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.200
Out of the question.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.600
(sighs)

08:30.280 --> 08:32.520
(Patty)
Yeah, mom! I'll be right down!

08:39.480 --> 08:41.720
Ahh. She's down there.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.400
She's rearranging
my candlesticks.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.400
Help me!

08:50.440 --> 08:51.840
-Look...
-(Patty sighs)

08:52.680 --> 08:55.040
this is what you do.
You say, "mom, I love you,

08:55.120 --> 08:57.360
but you're driving me to an early grave.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.240
Do not touch my candlesticks, ever."

09:04.120 --> 09:05.400
That's what you do.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.600
-You are so naive.
-What?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.000
Oh!

09:11.320 --> 09:13.720
-(Patty sighs)
-Hey!

09:16.880 --> 09:18.920
-What's all this?
-That's none of your business!

09:22.280 --> 09:23.960
Quit trying to read upside down.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.920
I was just making some lists.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.800
Possible jobs, possible people
I should possibly call.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.000
And, you know... some goals.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.000
-That's great!
-It's just something I'm doing.

09:39.080 --> 09:39.880
Okay.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.720
Don't get all enthusiastic
and ruin it for me.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.000
-Do I do that?
-Uh-huh.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.520
-Graham, would you...
-No.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.000
-How did you know?
-'Cause I know, 'cause she's down there

09:54.080 --> 09:55.560
fiddling with your candlesticks.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.240
Graham, please,
I'm asking very nicely.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.640
-Please just spend a little time...
-No. No way.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.080
-I would do it for you.
-My mother's dead!

10:03.160 --> 10:06.160
-If she weren't...
-You wouldn't have to do it for me.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.600
-I enjoyed my mother's company.
-Oh, please!

10:09.680 --> 10:12.280
I wouldn't go down there
now if you paid me!

10:12.360 --> 10:14.720
She's gonna hear you!

10:16.040 --> 10:19.160
Graham... please...

10:19.240 --> 10:22.240
I have to go pick Angela up
clear across town.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.360
Patty, Patty,
I'm not going down there.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.880
(Vivian)
Patricia! Are you up there?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.600
Patricia!

10:31.080 --> 10:35.520
Well, I'll just be
in the kitchen... poking around.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.480
Poking around?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.200
Vivian.
I didn't know you were here.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.920
-Here we have it.
-Wow. That...

10:48.000 --> 10:51.040
that was amazing.
How'd you learn how to do that?

10:51.120 --> 10:55.440
I learned it from a stupid book.
You can learn it for yourself.

10:55.520 --> 11:00.000
-(doorbell buzzes)
-Oh, God. My mother.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.320
I'll get it.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.280
-(door opens)
-(bells jingling)

11:07.360 --> 11:09.840
-Come in.
-Thank you.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.920
(crystals tinkle)

11:13.000 --> 11:17.200
-Mom, you could've just honked.
-Hi. Patty, right?

11:17.280 --> 11:18.880
Hi. Yes.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.400
-Amber. Well...
-Oh.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.720
I do tarot. It's just a hobby.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.480
-Would you like a drink?
-No. We should be getting right back.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.320
Before you go, Angela,
let me find you that book.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.480
-She's really good at them, the cards.
-I'm sure.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.600
(crystals tinkle)

11:41.400 --> 11:43.800
Angela is so cute,
you could smack her.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.600
But the mom is like from a commercial
for something really clean.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.000
(giggles)

11:50.920 --> 11:54.240
I might just send that money
back to dad.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.960
I kind of don't want it.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.560
Where is that book?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.280
Amber. We should go.
I've got errands to run.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.600
I'm giving this party
for my parents' anniversary

12:05.680 --> 12:08.360
-Saturday at our house.
-I found it. Yes!

12:08.440 --> 12:10.720
At our house? I thought it was
at some restaurant.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.600
I love parties... throwing them,
going to them, recovering from them.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.920
Listen, I think it's so great
that you're throwing them a party.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.400
I think it'll help you
work through it.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.480
Uh-huh. Work through what?

12:24.560 --> 12:29.280
-We should go.
-Your feelings about adoption.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.720
What a thing to deal with!

12:31.800 --> 12:35.520
-I saw a special... did you catch that?
-No.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.160
Ohh. It really got me.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.080
I mean, I was bawling.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.160
You know, I think I might've given up
a baby in a past life.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.560
Well, if there's anything
you need for the party...

12:48.640 --> 12:50.440
Thanks.
I think we have everything.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.040
Angela, here's the book.
Go ahead, take it.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.040
Here are the cards.
You can practice with these.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.920
Just be sure you treat them
with respect. Promise me.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.400
-I promise.
-(kisses)

13:03.480 --> 13:04.680
Mmm!

13:06.840 --> 13:08.160
Angel.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.760
-(Rayanne's mother sighs)
-(car approaching indistinctly)

13:21.240 --> 13:22.640
Okay, what's your question?

13:22.720 --> 13:25.240
Okay. Does Justin Connolly
like Caren Kligman?

13:25.320 --> 13:26.160
Come on.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.200
-What?
-That's not an important question.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.400
It is to Caren Kligman.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.120
You have to treat these cards
with respect.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.280
Angela, you know what I thought
we might do?

13:36.360 --> 13:38.600
Do you remember
those beautiful decorations

13:38.680 --> 13:41.760
that you did for Sharon's birthday
a few years ago, the streamers?

13:41.840 --> 13:45.040
-Mom, streamers?
-What's wrong with streamers?

13:45.840 --> 13:47.320
I need somebody to do streamers,

13:47.400 --> 13:50.200
and I need somebody to move
the furniture and clean behind it.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.240
You expect me to move furniture?

13:52.320 --> 13:56.120
Is grandma going to drive everyone crazy
like she did on thanksgiving?

13:56.720 --> 13:58.440
What on earth does that mean?

14:01.320 --> 14:03.320
It's a fairly straightforward
question.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Oh, I meant to tell you.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.760
I found this really interesting-sounding
recipe for no-fat chicken.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.000
-It's skinless...
-You cannot cook chicken without the skin.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.800
That's where all the flavor is.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.200
You can really tell she's been
spending time with grandma.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.360
Listen, can we just pitch in

14:24.440 --> 14:26.760
and all pull together

14:26.840 --> 14:29.600
because, you know, I think
this could be really fun.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.440
I really kind of do.

14:32.520 --> 14:36.000
Well, I hope so,
because life was created to be lived.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.080
Was that on a tarot card?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.440
Fine. I'll do the streamers.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.440
-(birds chirping)
-(children playing indistinctly)

14:47.360 --> 14:48.920
(bell rings)

14:49.000 --> 14:52.760
You said you were never again
going to hang in the girls' room.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.440
-Never say never.
-Hi.

14:57.160 --> 15:01.960
-What's wrong with your hair?
-Oh. Just... just never mind, okay?

15:02.040 --> 15:07.400
-I think you need some mousse.
-Hey, careful, Rayanne.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.600
You're dropping all of your money.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.960
It's crispy.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.400
It's like dead leaves.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.280
Rayanne, how much have you had
to drink today?

15:17.840 --> 15:19.120
She's been drinking?

15:19.200 --> 15:22.320
There's no drinking in school.
Don't you know that?

15:22.400 --> 15:26.200
-Here. Buy yourself a wig.
-Stop it.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.320
She needs a wig.
Oh, don't go. Don't go.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.280
(sighs)
Ingrate.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.920
-Here, I want you to have it.
-Don't be crazy, okay?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.600
Well, I don't deserve it.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.640
Rayanne, you should
buy yourself something.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.240
I mean, think. What do you really need?
You need new makeup.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.640
Makeup goes bad. It does.
It spoils.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.960
You need new CDs because
the ones you have suck.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.680
And you could definitely use
a leather jacket.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.800
Rickie, you're brilliant.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.280
A party!

16:03.720 --> 16:05.120
-(bell rings)
-Like an event.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.920
A memory
I'll have for the rest of my life.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.720
-Like Tino's party?
-Only endless.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.880
Like infininity, where so much
is going on every second

16:14.960 --> 16:19.280
that there's no possibility for,
uh, for... your mind to wander.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.440
And you become this prisoner
of, like... happiness!

16:23.520 --> 16:25.840
-(bell rings)
-Yeah! Ha-ha!

16:30.600 --> 16:31.800
Mom.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.240
Don't want to bother you.
Brought over a few extras.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.440
-I told you I have a meeting.
-Whatever.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.640
Just go about your normal routine.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.760
A few extras?

16:41.840 --> 16:44.400
Turkey is the easiest thing
in the world.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.200
-And a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.
-Mom...

16:47.280 --> 16:49.480
Go. Go to your meeting.
I'll put those things away.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.920
Mom, here's the thing.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.160
Graham is very emotional about food
when he's cooking it.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.880
-Emotional about food?
-Yes, he's got very strong,

17:00.960 --> 17:05.440
you know, feelings about meals
in terms of preparing them.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.240
-Patty, it's only a turkey.
-Mom, it's huge.

17:09.320 --> 17:13.800
-It'll need its own room.
-I wanted to contribute something.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.280
-(footsteps receding)
-Emotional about food?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.520
Never mind.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.960
So, yeah, tell everybody.
It's going to be a total blowout.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.320
No dorks and not too many
sophomores. Wait!

17:31.280 --> 17:36.160
(upbeat music playing)

17:36.240 --> 17:40.280
So, you know, if you want to acquire
certain pharmaceuticals for the party...

17:40.360 --> 17:44.200
-I definitely do. Yeah.
-(beeper beeps)

17:44.280 --> 17:50.160
(upbeat music continues)

17:57.320 --> 17:59.560
Should I get a party bowl
or a keg?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.640
Would every person...
take the address.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.360
(upbeat music continues)

18:31.440 --> 18:35.400
-I'm sorry. I tried to reason with her.
-(Graham sighs)

18:40.480 --> 18:43.960
Graham, please.
Please close the refrigerator.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.400
(birds chirping)

18:47.680 --> 18:49.280
(refrigerator door closes)

19:02.160 --> 19:03.360
Well, I'm not sure,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.880
but I have a feeling
if you want to tag with us,

19:05.960 --> 19:08.320
I could probably get you in.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.400
Angela, word of mouth is, like,
so huge on this thing.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.560
Some girl just invited me.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.480
She, like, invited me
to my own house.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.840
Saturday is going
to be historical.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.120
-Wait, this Saturday?
-Yeah. This Saturday.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.920
Tomorrow night.
I mentioned this at least a dozen times.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.680
Tomorrow night, I have
that stupid thing for my grandparents.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.720
Fine. Go hang with your grandparents.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.640
You can memorize all the state birds
or something.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.200
(indistinct chatter)

19:42.280 --> 19:45.920
Hey, Angela. I'm a bitch!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.760
Wait, if I can't come,
can I at least help you get ready?

19:48.840 --> 19:54.120
-Help how?
-Well, I could move furniture.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.360
Table there.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.920
(upbeat music playing)

20:01.000 --> 20:03.160
Okay, now, remember the rules.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.720
-Rayanne, are you listening to me?
-Yes.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.440
There is absolutely no eating on my bed,
is that clear?

20:09.520 --> 20:10.760
-Yes.
-Yes.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
And don't let things
get out of control.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.440
I realize there'll be some drinking,

20:16.520 --> 20:20.840
and I'd rather have it go on
under my roof. But don't get too loud.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.640
I don't want any lectures from
that tight-ass neighborhood watch.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.920
-Okay?
-Okay.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.920
-Yes?
-Yes.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.840
-Your mother is amazing.
-Ha-ha.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.560
-This party is driving me crazy.
-Look. Death.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.920
I should never have told her
she could have dinner at Rayanne's.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.760
She was supposed to help shine
this silver.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.160
Have Danielle do it.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.200
I can't.
I'm predicting the future.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.640
To put something that large in somebody's
refrigerator without permission.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.040
Mom, what's your question?

20:50.120 --> 20:53.440
-Why am I doing this?
-(telephone rings)

20:54.440 --> 20:58.080
Hello. Oh, Vivian.
Yeah, she's right here.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.400
Mom. Before you say anything,
I've been thinking.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.040
What? Oh! Okay.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.640
No. Fine. Never mind.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.880
Bye.

21:16.720 --> 21:21.600
Well, dad has been released from the
hospital. The tests came back negative.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.240
The doctors have given him
a clean bill of health,

21:24.320 --> 21:29.320
so, I guess there's no reason not
to go ahead with the party, right?

21:30.120 --> 21:33.600
So I guess that's really good news,
isn't it? Isn't it?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.800
Graham?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.800
Isn't it?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.480
Mom. What's your question?

21:42.840 --> 21:45.440
(chuckles) I love these.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.720
I'm never going
to take them down.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.920
I'm just going to spend the whole
rest of my life with your streamers.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.920
(chuckles) Oh, Angela. Mmm.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.320
You have to go to this other party.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.360
-Oh, well.
-(sighs) Yeah.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.160
Maybe there's a way
that you can go to both parties.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.320
(sirens blaring at distance)

22:13.000 --> 22:15.240
You have to go where
your karma takes you.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.720
I don't think my mother
really...

22:18.480 --> 22:20.200
knows much about karma.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.480
(sighs)

22:24.320 --> 22:25.240
(clicks tongue)

22:25.320 --> 22:26.960
Maybe you can teach her.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.840
-I said I would do it.
-Well, I'm doing it.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.040
-Leave it. I'll do it in the morning.
-(Patty scoffs)

22:41.120 --> 22:44.120
We have a lot of other things
to do in the morning.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.840
-About a million other things.
-All right.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.560
Didn't know
it was such a big deal.

22:52.480 --> 22:57.640
Mom, so, turns out there's
this thing tomorrow at Rayanne's,

22:57.720 --> 23:01.800
-like, this birthday party.
-Like this birthday party?

23:02.880 --> 23:04.040
Yeah.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.240
So, it's sort of happening tomorrow.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.360
So, you know, that's why I was
there so long, 'cause I was helping.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.120
Could I... maybe stay here for a while
and then go to Rayanne's?

23:18.720 --> 23:20.760
You were helping
with Rayanne's party?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.440
-Mom.
-Forget it.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.160
How could you tell that woman
I'm adopted?

23:28.760 --> 23:32.600
She's not just some woman.
I trust her.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.040
-I didn't know it was a secret.
-It's not.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.600
It's just not something
I want everybody to know.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.960
-Why can't I go to Rayanne's party?
-I need you here.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.920
You're having it here
'cause grandma talked you into it.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.560
That is not true.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.560
(sighs)

23:53.360 --> 23:57.640
You know, the karma in this house
is, like, ridiculous.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.560
-Really?
-Yeah. It's really low.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.440
Dark.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
Whatever it is that happens to karma.

24:06.280 --> 24:11.040
I'll bet the karma at Amber's house
is through the damn roof.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.560
Listen, you are not going to Rayanne's.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.920
You are going to attend
your grandparents' 45th anniversary party.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.680
Is that clear?

24:26.040 --> 24:31.480
-(footsteps receding)
-(Patty sighs)

24:40.080 --> 24:43.800
-(announcers) <i>Don't go away.</i>
<i>-ABC's </i>My so called Life <i>isn't over yet.</i>

24:48.760 --> 24:52.160
(theme music playing)

25:03.160 --> 25:04.840
(buzzer)

25:04.920 --> 25:06.960
Let the games begin.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.400
(buzzer)

25:09.360 --> 25:10.760
Rickster, throw on some music!

25:14.880 --> 25:16.200
Ah!

25:19.320 --> 25:22.320
-What?
-What do you mean, what? Where is daddy?

25:22.400 --> 25:24.480
Oh. Daddy.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.360
He didn't want to come.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.920
-What?
-You know how he hates parties.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.600
-Graham!
-Vivian.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.760
Happy 45th wedding anniversary.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.640
-Where's Chuck?
-He isn't coming.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.600
What? Are you kidding?

25:41.680 --> 25:45.600
-Well, he didn't feel like it.
-Really?

25:45.680 --> 25:49.120
-You know how he hates parties.
-You know something?

25:49.200 --> 25:50.840
I think we're better off.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.160
I can never really enjoy myself
when he's around.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.880
Let's look at it this way.
We can all relax.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.680
We don't have to worry about
all his crazy dietary restrictions.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.040
But it's already made.
I already worried.

26:04.120 --> 26:07.160
The entire meal is nonfat.
No sugar.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.400
-(Vivian sighs)
-I took the skin off the chicken.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.760
Hey, I thought Angela
was supposed to do this.

26:11.840 --> 26:16.480
Hay is for horses. Ah.
Let me see you. I love your outfit.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.560
I hate this outfit.
I wish I was dead.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.040
-No, you don't.
-Mother, just...

26:21.120 --> 26:24.440
How do you know whether I wish
I was dead or not? Are you me?

26:24.520 --> 26:27.920
Am I allowed feelings,
or is that just Angela?

26:28.440 --> 26:31.200
(footsteps receding)

26:32.040 --> 26:33.360
(doorbell rings, door opens)

26:33.440 --> 26:35.120
Happy 45th!

26:35.200 --> 26:38.160
-Hi!
-Oh! Aunt Libby!

26:38.240 --> 26:39.800
Oh, don't you look cute?

26:39.880 --> 26:41.840
-Hi, uncle Walter.
-You look gorgeous!

26:41.920 --> 26:44.640
-You weren't supposed to bring something!
-It's so sweet!

26:47.000 --> 26:49.360
(Angela) <i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>if my mother wasn't so good</i>

26:49.440 --> 26:51.160
<i>at pretending to be happy...</i>

26:55.200 --> 26:59.280
<i>she'd be better at actually...</i>
<i>being happy.</i>

27:00.120 --> 27:04.160
(indistinct conversation)

27:04.240 --> 27:07.480
-(loud music plays)
-(indistinct yelling, talking)

27:40.080 --> 27:41.720
Is this satanic, or what?

27:41.800 --> 27:44.520
-Uh, who are these people?
-Hey, Rickie!

27:44.600 --> 27:45.680
Hi.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.160
I have no idea.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.520
There's people here I've never seen!

27:50.600 --> 27:55.080
There's people in the bathroom,
I don't think they're from Pennsylvania.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.600
Have you seen Tino?

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
Rayanne, I'm lucky I found you.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.680
You did your hair in braids. You know
who you look like now, Danny?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.400
Who is that funny little Swedish
girl with the monkey...

28:12.480 --> 28:16.800
-Pippi Longstocking.
-That's it! Pippi Longstocking.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.000
(chuckles) Look, Libby. Doesn't
she look like that little Swedish girl?

28:20.080 --> 28:22.720
I need you to pass hors d'oeuvres.
Where are you going?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.080
To change.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.360
I thought you said
she destroyed her hair.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.920
No. That was the other one.
Where is Angela?

28:30.800 --> 28:32.320
Good question.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.160
Angela, I need you downstairs.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.160
(knocks on door)
Angela.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.440
That is what you choose to wear to
your grandparents' anniversary party?

28:47.520 --> 28:49.640
Mom, I think I'm going to Rayanne's.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.000
Mom, just for a little while.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.680
-(mellow music playing)
-(glasses clink)

29:00.760 --> 29:02.920
-Patty, how are you?
-Hi! Great.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Hors d'oeuvres are that way.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.760
(indistinct conversation)

29:08.840 --> 29:11.240
-(indistinct conversation)
-(loud music playing)

29:19.520 --> 29:21.440
-Rayanne!
-What?

29:22.160 --> 29:23.800
It's a party.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.040
Boy scout.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.920
(loud music playing)

29:32.200 --> 29:34.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do what you want to the turkey.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.000
The turkey means nothing to me.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.160
But this is my chicken, all right?

29:40.240 --> 29:43.720
-I was simply adjusting the seasoning.
-It is a curry sauce.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.040
-You do not put oregano is a curry sauce.
-What?

29:48.160 --> 29:50.240
You can't go wrong with oregano.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.960
-Oregano is the universal herb.
-Mom? Uh, hi, grandma.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.880
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Happy anniversary.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.840
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

29:59.320 --> 30:03.360
-Oh. That's quite a getup.
-I asked her to change.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.720
-No, you didn't.
-Well, it's fine.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.000
Let her just wear
what she wants.

30:07.080 --> 30:10.600
-Fine? It's not fine.
-Where's grandpa?

30:10.680 --> 30:13.280
-Tell her.
-I have to check the turkey.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.360
You want to know where grandpa is?
He's not coming.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.880
-That's where grandpa is.
-Is he back in the hospital?

30:18.960 --> 30:21.240
No. He's fine.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.640
Oh. So...

30:23.720 --> 30:27.000
grandpa is not coming,
but yet I have to be here?

30:27.080 --> 30:30.360
-That really makes sense.
-You don't have to be here.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.040
-Go do your thing, as they say.
-Mom!

30:33.120 --> 30:35.840
Why should she stick around
when she's got better plans?

30:35.920 --> 30:38.400
What about family,
doing what's right?

30:38.480 --> 30:40.400
-Fooey.
-Doing what's right?

30:40.480 --> 30:43.120
We're having a party for someone
who isn't here.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.960
-I'm missing Rayanne's party because...
-Who's Rayanne?

30:46.040 --> 30:47.360
My best friend.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.240
You're missing your best friend's party.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.480
-Hi.
-Lovely hors d'oeuvres.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.440
Rayanne is not your best friend.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.640
Mom, she is so my best friend.
I'm sorry you hate her.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.760
-You hate her?
-Mother, butt out.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.080
Another fun-filled
party at the Chases'.

31:05.160 --> 31:09.360
I apologize deeply that our house
cannot measure up to the joy

31:09.440 --> 31:12.400
of being at Rayanne's where
your friend Rickie can guzzle beer

31:12.480 --> 31:14.840
and that Amber woman
reads your tea leaves.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.560
Oh, just stop it!
Rickie doesn't even drink.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.120
-Who is Rickie?
-Stop being so hypocritical.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.640
You hated her on sight.
Just admit it.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.760
All right. I admit it.
I don't like her.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.480
I don't think she's the right
friend for you.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.840
(indistinct conversation)

31:37.440 --> 31:38.560
Ohh!

31:38.640 --> 31:42.120
(door opens, closes)

31:43.040 --> 31:45.920
-(indistinct conversation)
-(loud music playing)

32:36.680 --> 32:37.960
Angela!

32:39.280 --> 32:43.040
Ohh! To see you at this moment...

32:43.720 --> 32:45.920
something was missing, you know?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.760
And then I turned around...

32:50.720 --> 32:54.360
I just love you so much.
I've been doing good, my friend.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.520
-Hey, excuse me, man.
-Rayanne.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.160
Oh, my...

33:02.000 --> 33:08.040
(indistinct conversation)

33:10.560 --> 33:12.120
Rayanne.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.320
I didn't get my tattoo. I...

33:16.920 --> 33:20.280
I want it to look just like this.
I want it to look like this.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.680
She's always okay.
By the time it's over.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.080
What the hell?

33:30.160 --> 33:33.760
-Where is she? Rayanne!
-(shuts off music)

33:33.840 --> 33:36.160
The party's over. Let's go.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.720
What's the deal?

33:38.320 --> 33:41.200
-Get out of here.
-And you, find a Chevy to do that.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.200
Get out of my house!

33:43.280 --> 33:45.880
Go on. Get out of here!

33:45.960 --> 33:47.040
Hi, sweetheart.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.000
You have two minutes to get out
before I call the police.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.760
You got it?

33:55.400 --> 33:56.720
Rayanne!

34:00.400 --> 34:02.840
-Get off my daughter!
-Hi, mom.

34:02.920 --> 34:03.840
Get out of my house.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.280
Hey, I'm just an artist trying
to make a living.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.760
You were going to have
a few friends over?

34:08.840 --> 34:11.360
This place is a pigsty!

34:11.440 --> 34:14.560
I got 10 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet rusty,

34:14.640 --> 34:17.120
-and you're destroying the house.
-Sorry.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.040
No, I'm sorry.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.920
Tomorrow we're going to have
a long talk about your behavior.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.640
You are too drunk, young lady.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.080
What did I say about moderation,
huh?

34:29.160 --> 34:30.360
What did I say?

34:32.680 --> 34:36.000
I trusted you. Now look at you.
You look like an old drunk.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.040
(coughing)

34:38.920 --> 34:41.000
You pull yourself together,
Rayanne Marie.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.000
I want this whole place cleaned
up by the time I get back.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.600
(door slams)

34:51.680 --> 34:52.960
Rickie.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.120
I love you.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.480
You know that... don't you?

35:03.560 --> 35:05.360
-I'm so cold.
-It's okay.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.400
What's wrong? Is she okay?

35:08.040 --> 35:11.920
-Just take it easy, okay?
-Why is it so cold?

35:18.400 --> 35:20.320
(mellow music playing)

35:22.320 --> 35:24.920
-Have to sleep a little bit.
-Get water.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.640
I have to sleep.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.680
Throw it on her face.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.240
Rayanne, wake up.
You can't sleep!

35:33.320 --> 35:36.600
-Stop. God.
-Rickie, wh...

35:36.680 --> 35:40.400
Never seen her like this.
I don't know what to do, Angela.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.760
I know what to do.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.360
-That's a big one.
-Yeah.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.240
-Whoa! Another big one.
-I turned to the waiter,

35:50.320 --> 35:54.400
and by this time,
the entire restaurant is listening.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.400
And I turned to the waiter
and I put down my chopsticks and I said,

35:58.480 --> 36:02.400
"well, I'm sorry,
but if it smells like MSG,

36:02.480 --> 36:04.640
-and it tastes like MSG..."
-(telephone rings)

36:07.600 --> 36:09.680
(rings)

36:13.280 --> 36:14.920
(telephone ringing)

36:29.840 --> 36:32.760
(suspenseful music playing)

36:37.200 --> 36:40.480
-Angela?
-Mommy, I really need you.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.840
-Mom.
-It's all right. Go.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.800
-Tell Graham.
-Go.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.160
(knocks on door and door opens)

36:53.680 --> 36:56.200
-Mommy.
-It's okay. I've called an ambulance.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.120
How long has she been like this?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.760
-You mean, how long...
-This slow breathing.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.600
-A while. 15 minutes.
-Rayanne!

37:07.680 --> 37:10.240
-What did she take?
-I don't know. She just kept on drinking.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.280
Okay. A lot of alcohol.
What about drugs?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.600
-She took ecstasy.
-How much?

37:15.680 --> 37:19.840
I don't know! I think just like two hits.
She was saving one.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.120
Can you find me
the one she was saving?

37:22.200 --> 37:24.680
Rickie, find me the one
she was saving.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.080
Get me a blanket.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.640
She's waking up.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.440
Rayanne!

37:33.520 --> 37:35.240
-Rayanne.
-I don't like you!

37:35.320 --> 37:36.880
Here.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.160
(siren approaches)

37:43.920 --> 37:46.160
She's had a lot of alcohol
and some ecstasy.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.160
Two hits or whatever you call them.
Here's the third one.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.080
Go on. Ride with her.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.000
(woman speaking over PA)

38:02.920 --> 38:04.080
All they had was barbecue.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.320
-I hope that's okay.
-It's fine.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.480
-Where's Angela?
-Ladies room.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.360
Mrs. Chase, I really appreciate
what you did tonight.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.760
It's okay.

38:15.840 --> 38:20.160
-(elevator dings)
-(woman speaking over PA)

38:20.240 --> 38:22.360
Has there ever been someone...

38:27.880 --> 38:28.920
What?

38:32.840 --> 38:34.920
Did you ever try to protect someone...

38:36.680 --> 38:37.880
so much...

38:39.560 --> 38:41.120
that it, like, hurt?

38:41.960 --> 38:44.840
-(elevator dings)
-(woman speaking over PA)

38:48.400 --> 38:51.320
That wasn't your beer
the other day, was it?

38:54.480 --> 38:56.840
You can see her now,
if you'd like.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.080
You go on.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.360
I'm going to wait here for Angela.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.000
Okay.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.400
(mellow music playing)

39:23.800 --> 39:24.880
Raynnie!

39:24.960 --> 39:26.800
-Shh, shh, shh.
-Oh, God!

39:26.880 --> 39:29.800
-Oh, oh, oh, God.
-She's going to be okay.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.360
-She's going to be okay.
-Oh, God, what a night!

39:33.640 --> 39:36.520
A cop called me and told me
they pumped her stomach?

39:36.600 --> 39:39.680
Well, Rayanne had a really close call.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.440
These kids can scare
the hell out of you.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.200
Amber,
the doctor was very concerned,

39:45.280 --> 39:47.920
-she needs sleep, Amber.
-Raynnie!

39:48.000 --> 39:49.760
Okay. Mama.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.840
-(sobbing)
-Uh, Ms. Vallone.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.200
-Ms. Vallone?
-What?

39:57.280 --> 39:59.560
A policeman needs to speak with you.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.160
-Are you kidding me? Again?
-Yes, ma'am.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.880
-Mom, why...
-Don't be scared.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.680
They're just filling out reports.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.360
(machine beeping)

40:15.320 --> 40:18.680
How would you like to attend
a very dull party?

40:43.040 --> 40:46.400
Would you go inside and tell them
we'll be there in a minute?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.080
Sure.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.160
(Patty sighs)

40:57.240 --> 41:00.040
I guess I kind of screwed everything up
for you today...

41:00.920 --> 41:01.920
with the party.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.080
Nope. You did the right thing.
You called me.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.200
I mean it.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.760
Promise you you'll always do that,
you'll always...

41:09.840 --> 41:10.880
Okay!

41:13.640 --> 41:15.600
Okay, I promise.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.120
How did you know all that stuff,
like what to do?

41:21.800 --> 41:22.880
Mmm.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.600
I had this roommate in college who...

41:28.360 --> 41:31.640
actually was a lot like Rayanne,
now that I'm remembering.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.120
You're kidding.
So what happened?

41:36.120 --> 41:39.040
Well, pretty much
what happened tonight.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.560
Except she died.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.400
-So did you like her?
-A lot.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.560
-Mom, was she...
-Angela, I fee...

41:57.520 --> 42:00.160
what I'm seeing
in your future is so...

42:00.880 --> 42:03.800
frightening,
it scares the hell out of me.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.760
I mean, what do I do?

42:05.840 --> 42:10.040
Do I just not let you see her anymore?
I mean, would that even work?

42:11.160 --> 42:12.200
No.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.000
Mom, I can't...

42:18.120 --> 42:19.680
she's my friend.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.560
Please, just trust me.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.720
Actually, I do.

42:39.600 --> 42:44.160
Oh, God. Poor Rickie.
He's surrounded by our relatives.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.800
Go on in.
I'll be there in a sec.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.040
-(car door closes)
-(footsteps receding)

42:58.040 --> 42:59.880
(indistinct conversation)

43:03.560 --> 43:05.360
-Oh, hello.
-Angela!

43:05.440 --> 43:07.920
Hi, sweetheart. We missed you.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh, I love your hair.
That's wonderful hair!

43:10.080 --> 43:11.280
Thank you.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.160
Don't be shy. Have some more.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.120
You know, it tastes
really amazing. It's kind of...

43:18.920 --> 43:20.480
Italian.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.960
-That's the oregano.
-Oh!

43:24.040 --> 43:26.520
-(Patty sobbing)
-(serene music playing)

43:43.440 --> 43:45.320
What the heck is going on?

43:45.400 --> 43:47.360
We're having a party.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.920
-Angela!
-How are you?

43:50.680 --> 43:52.280
Patty, there you are.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.920
(indistinct conversation)

43:58.360 --> 44:04.360
(mellow music playing)

44:06.600 --> 44:08.200
(Angela)<i> Each card has a name.</i>

44:09.560 --> 44:11.000
<i>The magician...</i>

44:14.000 --> 44:15.680
<i>the empress...</i>

44:17.080 --> 44:18.480
<i>the fool...</i>

44:21.480 --> 44:23.680
<i>the wheel of fortune...</i>

44:29.000 --> 44:30.400
<i>strength.</i>

44:35.680 --> 44:40.880
<i>They represent challenges</i>
<i>and tests, twists of fate.</i>

44:45.920 --> 44:48.560
<i>No card is all good or all bad.</i>

44:48.640 --> 44:52.760
<i>Cards can be positive or negative,</i>
<i>depending on where they fall.</i>

44:58.680 --> 45:00.800
<i>When you read someone's future,</i>

45:00.880 --> 45:05.200
<i>they must think of a question.</i>
<i>They must hold it in their mind.</i>

45:05.280 --> 45:10.320
<i>The cards are read in sequence.</i>
<i>Each card leads to the next.</i>

45:10.400 --> 45:15.880
<i>We move from terror and loss</i>
<i>to unexpected good fortune,</i>

45:15.960 --> 45:20.240
<i>and out of darkness, hope is born.</i>
