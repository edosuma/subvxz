00:50.884 --> 00:53.136
- Well, shit.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.763
Can I get a drink?

00:54.846 --> 00:57.057
- Yeah.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.392
- I got it.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.488
- Thanks, Pete.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.367
- Sylvi, anything?

01:15.450 --> 01:16.868
- Yeah, I'll have a beer.

01:16.952 --> 01:20.581
- Mom, you shouldn't.
- Shut up, Brenda!

01:31.925 --> 01:36.847
- So how many more, uh,
treatments do you need to get?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.640
- I don't know.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.143
- She goes every week for the-
- Brenda, I said I didn't know.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.519
I didn't say I want to know.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.105
- Sorry!
(crying)

01:47.608 --> 01:49.443
(Marsha chuckles)

01:50.736 --> 01:52.154
- Why are you laughing?

01:55.741 --> 02:01.246
- She's crying at a wake,
but not because of who died.

02:01.330 --> 02:06.251
She's crying because of what
a cunt her mother is!

02:06.335 --> 02:08.502
- Jesus Christ.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.007
I thought Uncle Pete was
the mean one.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.760
- Hey, don't speak ill
of the dead.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.263
- I'm speaking ill
of the still left alive.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
- All right, come on,
can we all just have...

02:23.226 --> 02:26.146
a drink now
in honor of my dad?

02:26.229 --> 02:28.607
- Your dad, that's a laugh.

02:30.776 --> 02:31.069
- All the same,

02:32.152 --> 02:36.657
he was here every day
in our lives.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.621
And now he's gone.

02:51.797 --> 02:56.343
And we survive him, so...

02:56.426 --> 02:58.054
can we just have a drink
for him, huh?

02:58.137 --> 03:00.305
Can we do that?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.559
To Uncle Pete.

03:04.643 --> 03:08.563
May he, uh...

03:08.647 --> 03:13.034
live on in... you know...

03:13.069 --> 03:17.698
- Yeah, Uncle Pete was, uh,
he was really something.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.784
And he always said what he felt.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.203
- Oh, please, those are exactly
the kinds of things

03:23.286 --> 03:25.247
I'd have said
at every asshole's wake.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.958
- Okay, well, this is that
particular asshole's wake,

03:27.993 --> 03:30.502
so I'm saying it.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.338
- Uncle Pete.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.187
I don't understand.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.314
Horace: What?

03:51.398 --> 03:52.024
- Why- why did he do it?

03:52.108 --> 03:55.402
Why did he kill himself?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.195
- I don't know, I...

03:59.281 --> 04:00.949
I mean, maybe he was lonely.

04:00.984 --> 04:02.367
(Marsha chuckles)

04:02.451 --> 04:04.578
- What is so fucking funny
to you now?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.289
- Lonely people,
"Ooh, I'm so lonely. "

04:07.372 --> 04:09.083
- You were never lonely?
- Never.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.501
- Yeah, 'cause you're drunk
all the time.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.128
- That's right.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.297
- So if you didn't drink,
you'd- you'd be lonely?

04:15.380 --> 04:15.972
- I don't know.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.176
I've never stopped long enough
to find out.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.017
- What, you mean...

04:21.053 --> 04:23.680
There must've been some time
in your life

04:23.764 --> 04:24.890
where you just, you know-

04:25.432 --> 04:27.392
You didn't drink when you were
a baby, right? So...

04:27.476 --> 04:29.644
How old were you
when you started drinking?

04:32.106 --> 04:35.026
- 13.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.070
I mean, I developed early,
you know, tits and everything,

04:38.154 --> 04:41.364
so I used to go out
with the high school boys.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.909
- High school boys at 13?

04:43.992 --> 04:49.915
- Hey, I knew girls back
in high school

04:49.998 --> 04:52.959
that were 16 or 17
when they got married.

04:52.994 --> 04:54.628
I mean, that's what girls did.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.630
You were a child,
you were a teenager,

04:56.713 --> 04:58.924
then you looked for somebody
who wanted you,

04:58.959 --> 05:00.884
and you married them, that's it.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.888
- So you drank with high school boys
when you were 13 years old.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.306
- Sure.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.391
Yeah.

05:08.475 --> 05:13.688
We used to jump in cars
and drive out to Rockaway Beach,

05:13.772 --> 05:16.983
build a great big fire
and drink gin

05:17.018 --> 05:19.361
or whatever anybody had.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.946
I was, uh...

05:22.989 --> 05:24.574
I was 13.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.014
I mean,
the other girls were older,

05:27.049 --> 05:29.371
but I looked just as good
as they did.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.456
Better than most.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.124
(chuckles)

05:32.208 --> 05:34.876
Yeah.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.879
And I liked boys...

05:37.963 --> 05:39.756
a lot.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.969
So, you know,
we'd laugh and we'd drink

05:44.004 --> 05:48.099
and we'd lie in the sand
and... kiss.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.559
It was fun.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.315
It was really, really...

05:57.399 --> 05:59.033
It was really fun.

05:59.068 --> 06:03.989
Some of those girls, they, um,
married some of those guys

06:04.024 --> 06:07.409
when they turned 18
and got a job.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.412
But me?
(scoffs)

06:10.495 --> 06:12.372
I got knocked up.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.752
(sighs)

06:17.836 --> 06:19.629
And in those days,
you didn't have a choice.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.631
I mean, you just had the baby.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.260
I was young and stupid.

06:24.343 --> 06:28.347
I went through my eighth grade
pregnant.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.184
Then I had the baby
and I gave it away.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.986
So...

06:35.021 --> 06:38.815
pretty soon after that,
I- I- I don't know,

06:38.899 --> 06:41.422
I quit school.

06:41.457 --> 06:42.994
I started working.

06:43.029 --> 06:48.909
But I'd learned how to drink,
so I just kept doing that.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.662
And, uh...

06:54.915 --> 06:58.501
I don't know,
then I started drinking here.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.713
And your father liked me,
so I moved in with him...

07:01.796 --> 07:03.673
- And then he died.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.343
And since then,
Pete has been supporting you

07:06.426 --> 07:08.346
out of the cash register,
and you drank here free.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.021
- Yeah, that's right.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.184
- And- and then Pete died.
- Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

07:13.267 --> 07:17.437
- So there is less and less reason for
anybody here

07:17.520 --> 07:18.022
to give a shit
what happens to you.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.066
- Jesus Christ, Sylvia.
- Right?

07:20.149 --> 07:23.693
Well, if she's just another one
of Dad's bad choices,

07:23.777 --> 07:25.654
is she supposed
to be his fucking legacy?

07:25.737 --> 07:27.781
Really, Horace, wha- wha-

07:27.864 --> 07:29.783
When can we let go
of all this shit?

07:29.866 --> 07:31.534
- You want me to kick-
kick her out?

07:31.618 --> 07:32.744
You want me to cut her off?
What do you want me to do?

07:32.827 --> 07:33.412
- I don't know, Horace.
I'm tired!

07:34.496 --> 07:35.039
I can't fight for you anymore.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.666
- How are you fighting
for me?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.668
- Yeah, you should kick me out,
Horace, go ahead.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.045
You don't owe me anything.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.714
You can turn this place
into a Starbucks,

07:44.798 --> 07:48.094
and you can all move
to fuckin' Connecticut.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.887
- I can't close this place.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.681
- Why not?!

07:52.764 --> 07:54.683
- Because then
his retarded brother

07:54.766 --> 07:56.685
would end up on the streets.

07:56.768 --> 07:57.228
- I'm not retarded.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.729
- Jesus Christ,
nobody is retarded.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.357
God, I fucking hate Brooklyn
so much.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.402
- Hey, I don't need
this place to live.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.028
- Well, she is right.

08:06.112 --> 08:08.530
Pete, this is the only place
you've ever lived

08:08.613 --> 08:09.281
outside the hospital.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.575
- I'm capable of a lot more
than any of you think.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.244
- Yeah, like what?

08:13.327 --> 08:17.289
Someday you'll walk into a mall
and shoot everyone?

08:17.373 --> 08:19.291
- Never mind me.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.460
I'm saying this isn't about me.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.130
I'm saying I'm not the reason
to keep this place open

08:24.213 --> 08:26.756
and neither is Marsha.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.550
If you want to kick her out,
kick her out.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.468
She's had her run here.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.846
She was your dad's
pleasure chest,

08:32.929 --> 08:35.682
and then my dad honored him
by keeping her here.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.144
But, yeah, I mean,
we don't have to do anything.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.854
Yeah, we don't owe you
anything, Marsha.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.063
Nobody does.

08:42.148 --> 08:45.900
And you don't owe me
anything, Horace...

08:45.984 --> 08:47.736
or Sylvi.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.447
I'm not your brother,
I never was.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.741
I'm your cousin.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.618
You want to shut
this place down, go ahead.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.663
- I'm not shutting it down.
- Why not?

08:58.747 --> 09:02.751
- Because that just feels harder
than keeping it open right now.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.211
- Look, I met this guy last week who
said,

09:04.295 --> 09:07.589
"You could walk out
of this building right now

09:07.672 --> 09:10.217
and sell this place for upwards
of $6 million. "

09:10.301 --> 09:14.430
We could split that
$3 million each.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.308
- What about Pete?
- What about Pete?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.477
You just said, right?
- Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.270
I'm just your cousin.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.938
She's right, you should do it.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.650
- What for?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.943
I mean, give me a reason to do
that, why would I-

09:28.978 --> 09:30.862
- $3 million.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.489
- Then what? I mean, that's-

09:32.572 --> 09:34.032
You get that kind of money
when you're young

09:34.067 --> 09:35.493
and you use something
to build it with, right?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.119
I'm gonna tear this down

09:37.203 --> 09:39.121
and then get the money
and live, what-

09:39.205 --> 09:41.623
I'm 50 years old.
- Give it to your kid.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.793
- I won't take a penny of that.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.753
But you should do it
if you want to.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.714
- My mom needs that money.
She has cancer.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.050
- Brenda, get out.
I mean it, get out right now

09:51.133 --> 09:52.510
and go home.
- Mom.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.512
- Get out. Oh, stand up
and walk out that door.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.889
I do not want you in here.
- Mom!

09:57.972 --> 09:59.517
I have been here for-
- Get out!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
(Brenda crying)

10:16.075 --> 10:18.077
- Okay, well,

10:18.160 --> 10:22.414
um, you guys have a great day.
Bye.

10:22.498 --> 10:26.043
And when one of you dies,
I'll see the rest of you.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.336
So...

10:27.419 --> 10:29.588
- Honey...
- Bye.

10:32.091 --> 10:35.386
- Hey, let me have one more,
Pete, huh?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.304
The last one.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.615
Well, so long.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.880
(light knocking on door)

11:41.118 --> 11:43.786
- Yeah, yeah.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.664
Hey, are you guys open?

11:46.748 --> 11:48.042
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they're open.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.504
Uh-huh. No, they're all here.
Please come save me.

11:52.588 --> 11:56.841
- Horace, I don't know
if I can go anywhere.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.093
- Why don't you come upstairs
and take a lie-down, okay?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.388
Come on, I'll get you a cab
or something, but just-

12:01.472 --> 12:03.682
You need to rest, okay?

12:04.766 --> 12:05.434
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:05.517 --> 12:09.063
- Can I get a Corona
and two vodka martinis?

12:09.146 --> 12:11.232
- No mixed drinks, no Corona.

12:11.315 --> 12:15.277
Budweiser, Scotch, bourbon,
straight vodka, straight gin.

12:15.361 --> 12:18.656
- Serious? How the fuck
do you expect to stay open?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.158
- Hey, this bar's been here
for a hundred years.

12:21.242 --> 12:23.868
- Serious?
- Yeah.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.871
- Why is it called
Horace and Pete's?

12:26.955 --> 12:27.456
- 'Cause it's our place.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.708
That's Horace and I'm Pete.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.044
- So you guys are like
a hundred years old, too?

12:32.127 --> 12:36.298
- No, you see, this place was
opened in 1916

12:36.382 --> 12:38.300
by two brothers named
Horace and Pete,

12:38.384 --> 12:39.975
and each of them had a son.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.388
Horace had a son Horace,
Pete had a son Pete-

12:42.471 --> 12:47.309
- Look, man, I would just really love a
fucking beer right now.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.561
Do I have to listen to this?

12:49.645 --> 12:53.065
You want to tell me the origin story of
this stool here?

12:53.148 --> 12:55.150
Yawn, I mean, please don't.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.071
I'm sorry, my family's in town,
it's stressing me out.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.572
- It's all right.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.589
(sighs)

13:17.673 --> 13:20.634
- God, Horace,
I fucking hate this.

13:20.718 --> 13:22.344
- It's bad, huh?

13:22.428 --> 13:25.972
- God, you have no idea.

13:26.007 --> 13:27.224
I sure didn't.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.934
You know, I've seen people
go through this,

13:29.969 --> 13:30.561
and it looks awful.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.354
When you see them
with the kerchief on their head,

13:32.438 --> 13:36.233
you're like, oh, God,
that looks bad.

13:36.317 --> 13:39.028
But you really can't know,
you can't climb inside somebody

13:39.111 --> 13:43.741
and know what it feels like
to have your blood

13:44.824 --> 13:47.036
replaced by battery acid.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.788
- Fuck. Sorry.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.416
- Horace, can I stay here tonight?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.418
- Yeah, stay in your room.
- Thanks.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.629
Oh, God, no please.
That's not what I want.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.673
I'll just sleep here
on the couch, is that okay?

13:59.757 --> 14:02.842
- Sure.
- Thanks.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.514
- You kinda pushed Brenda
away there.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.767
I mean, she was-
she was taking care of you,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.935
and you literally told her,
"Go fuck off. "

14:12.970 --> 14:14.271
- And I don't regret it.

14:14.355 --> 14:17.775
Believe it or not, much as
I need her, I would rather die.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.651
- That's a little fucked up, Sylvia.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.612
She's taking care of you.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.239
- You don't know that one, Horace.

14:24.323 --> 14:29.411
She's got this way of leveraging
my needs against me.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.831
Just honestly,
I'd rather fend for myself.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.626
- All right, well,
it's your choice.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.836
- So, look,
I'll just stay here tonight,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.882
and, uh, in the morning,
I'll get an Uber to Sloan.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.260
And I'll just- I'll go home.
I'll be out of your hair

14:45.344 --> 14:50.057
and, uh, out of mind
soon thereafter, I'm sure.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.185
Fuck.

14:56.188 --> 14:59.031
- How are you, um...?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.318
I mean, are you still working?
Did you go back to work?

15:01.402 --> 15:03.445
- No, Horace,
I got laid off in April.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.072
- You did?
- Yeah.

15:05.155 --> 15:09.410
Yeah, I saved enough money
for maybe six months.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.662
This cancer's just ripping through it.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.123
- What about insurance?

15:14.206 --> 15:16.834
- Insurance, uh, covers
medical costs,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.253
but I didn't know is you just start
throwing money

15:19.336 --> 15:21.046
up all over the place.

15:21.130 --> 15:24.591
You know, life gets fucking expensive
when you start dying.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.843
You know,
it's a fucking nightmare.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.137
- You're not dying.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.055
You're not dying.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.476
- What- what happened
to Rachel anyway?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.478
(Horace chuckles)

15:36.562 --> 15:38.028
- I kicked her out.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.315
- You did?
Jesus Christ, why?

15:40.399 --> 15:42.651
She was- I mean, she was okay.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.654
I didn't love her,
but she was crazy about you.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.157
- Yeah, well...

15:48.240 --> 15:49.867
(clicks tongue)
You know, the only thing worse

15:50.950 --> 15:51.743
than living with somebody
who doesn't love you...

15:51.827 --> 15:54.580
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

15:54.663 --> 16:00.544
...is living with somebody
who really loves you a lot.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.358
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:02.393 --> 16:04.089
- Oh, oh, man.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.258
Well, what are you gonna do?

16:06.341 --> 16:07.759
- I mean, I'm all right.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.553
She's the one
who got kicked out.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.889
She's living with her brother.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.309
So her whole family
hates me now.

16:15.392 --> 16:19.313
- Yeah, you got to get jaded
to people hating you, Horace.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.190
Anybody who gets to their 40s

16:21.273 --> 16:25.944
without at least 10 people hating them
is just an asshole.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.780
- How do you figure that?

16:28.864 --> 16:30.782
- Well, if people hate you,

16:30.866 --> 16:32.784
you're probably taking care
of yourself, right?

16:32.868 --> 16:35.204
If nobody hates you,

16:35.287 --> 16:36.914
you're probably just
some asshole

16:37.997 --> 16:40.918
who's a burden
on everybody around you, right?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.462
- Yeah.
(chuckles)

16:47.174 --> 16:48.342
I'm gonna go to bed.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.551
- All right.

16:49.635 --> 16:52.054
(Horace sighs)

16:52.137 --> 16:55.057
- You need anything?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.559
- Yeah, a bucket.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.728
- Bucket.
- Yeah.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.730
- Bucket.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.190
- Or whatever.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.816
- Are you gonna puke right now?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.361
- At some point, uh...

17:09.695 --> 17:11.615
- Here you go.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.242
- That's pretty, thank you.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.579
- Hey, it's nice, uh,
nice to have you here.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.957
- Good night, honey.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.666
- Good night.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.339
♪♪

17:32.761 --> 17:35.764
(man humming)

17:44.773 --> 17:47.776
(man vocalizing)

17:58.453 --> 18:00.998
- ♪ Horace and Pete ♪

18:01.081 --> 18:02.541
- You know, I can't in my head

18:02.624 --> 18:03.001
climb into
another person's life.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.211
You know, like-
like I was dating this guy,

18:06.295 --> 18:07.713
and he used to take me
to the symphony,

18:07.796 --> 18:09.506
the, uh, New York Philharmonic,

18:09.590 --> 18:12.676
and I hated it so much.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.138
I mean, the music just droning
on and on and...

18:16.221 --> 18:19.182
And everyone's sitting there
like in their seats

18:19.266 --> 18:21.768
like dressed up,
looking down like...

18:23.270 --> 18:25.897
You know, like they're fucking
appreciating it.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.692
And it's like- it made me
so mad 'cause I'm like,

18:28.775 --> 18:30.402
you're all fucking faking it.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.195
I don't believe you like this
for a second.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.037
This is a con job.

18:33.072 --> 18:35.033
And you look down on the stage
and there's this orchestra.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.744
And it's like 50 guys
in their little tuxedos,

18:38.827 --> 18:40.495
and they're playing
their hearts out.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.372
And I see this trombone player.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.047
But he's not like
the trombone player.

18:43.082 --> 18:47.336
He's like second in a line
of 10 trombone players.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.921
You know how hard that guy
had to work?

18:49.956 --> 18:51.798
Like since he was fuckin' five.

18:51.882 --> 18:52.974
You know, so if by the time
you're five,

18:53.009 --> 18:56.678
you haven't decided you want
to be the second trombone player

18:56.762 --> 18:59.139
of the New York Philharmonic,
you're too late.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.351
Like if that's your goal
at eight, you're a loser.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.019
You know, so like
who's that guy?

19:03.102 --> 19:06.229
Who's the guy the age of five knows he
wants to spend

19:06.313 --> 19:10.692
his whole life playing the trombone for
the Philharmonic?

19:10.776 --> 19:13.195
- David Finlayson.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.572
- What?

19:15.656 --> 19:17.324
- David Finlayson,

19:17.407 --> 19:19.368
he's the second trombone
for the New York Philharmonic.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.370
- How the fuck do you know that?

19:21.453 --> 19:23.830
- It's- it's public information.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.708
- So... I wasn't talking
to you anyway.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.210
- Maybe you shouldn't
ask questions

19:28.293 --> 19:29.878
unless you want
to hear the answers.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.630
- Wow, you know what I wish?

19:31.713 --> 19:34.675
I wish it could be
Trump and Bernie Sanders

19:34.883 --> 19:36.468
as co-presidents.

19:36.551 --> 19:36.976
- Jesus, why?

19:37.011 --> 19:39.554
- Because they're the only ones

19:39.638 --> 19:41.306
that tell the truth
about anything, you know?

19:41.390 --> 19:43.308
Bernie's the only Democrat
that's willing to admit

19:43.392 --> 19:44.976
he's gonna hold a gun
to rich people's heads

19:45.011 --> 19:46.645
and make 'em pay for everything.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.772
And Trump's the only Republican
who's willing to admit

19:48.855 --> 19:51.733
that he doesn't give a shit
or know anything about anything

19:51.817 --> 19:54.361
and it's all a crooked game that
just he knows how to play.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.780
So then you'd have
this amazing system where like

19:56.863 --> 19:58.657
Bernie takes all the rich people's money

19:58.740 --> 20:00.951
and Trump just keeps giving it
back to 'em in bribes

20:00.986 --> 20:02.577
that keep the economy running.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.045
- What kind of a way is that
to run a country?

20:04.080 --> 20:07.207
- Well, it's not, it's gonna be
a fuckin' disaster.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.876
But it'll reveal
the true nature of our system

20:09.960 --> 20:11.545
and they'll just tear it
all down,

20:11.628 --> 20:12.011
just leave a fuckin' mess,

20:12.046 --> 20:14.464
so rich people
still have everything,

20:14.548 --> 20:16.466
but a dollar won't be
worth a dime,

20:16.550 --> 20:18.218
so who cares if you're rich?

20:18.301 --> 20:19.845
- All right, so you're saying

20:19.928 --> 20:22.848
just tear down what's there
and- and rebuild.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.183
Like build a better system.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.025
We can go back
to the barter system.

20:26.060 --> 20:29.604
You know, trade goods
and services amongst each other.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.356
Form local militias.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.400
Just build it back up,
start from scratch.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.068
But get it right.

20:34.152 --> 20:37.529
- No, I'm saying fuck all this.
Just like let it burn.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.698
We deserve it.
Fuck this country.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.575
- Hey, watch it.
- Why?!

20:41.658 --> 20:43.994
- I don't know,
you're supposed to say that

20:44.029 --> 20:45.871
when someone says the thing
you said.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.083
- Hello, excuse me, can I get
another fuckin' beer, please?

20:49.167 --> 20:52.211
Maybe make it taste more
like piss this time.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.048
And super warm, really super-
Oh, whoa!

20:56.132 --> 20:58.592
Oh, are we pushing?

20:58.675 --> 21:01.012
Does your little elbow
need more room?

21:01.095 --> 21:03.764
Oh, now you're standing.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.686
Oh, I am not scared of you, man,
just because you're tall.

21:09.770 --> 21:10.812
My fuckin' dad was taller
than you.

21:10.896 --> 21:11.230
Punch me in the face.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.815
I have been pummeled by men
bigger than you.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.442
- Guys...
- I will fuckin' kill you.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.444
I will rip your throat open!
- Jesus.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.821
- Okay.
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.698
Tom, sit down.
It's all right.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.742
- Yeah, Tom, sit down.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.410
- You gotta go.
- I gotta go?

21:25.494 --> 21:27.412
- Yeah, you gotta go.
- Tom should fuckin' go.

21:27.496 --> 21:28.206
- Well, it's gotta be
one of you.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.875
- I live down the block, so...
- Today it's- yeah, okay.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.377
- Fuck you.
I will see you tomorrow.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.551
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.722
- Hey, Sylvi.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.058
You okay? I heard you were
feeling lousy last night.

21:47.141 --> 21:49.664
- Yes, Pete, I have cancer.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.188
- I know.
I know that.

21:52.271 --> 21:55.191
- Hey, guys, can we... talk?

21:55.274 --> 21:58.527
Can we have a minute?
Let's talk through this.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.529
- I- I have a minute.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.697
- Let me have it, please.

22:02.781 --> 22:03.907
- Well, I got to watch the bar.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.826
- Buy them a round.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.829
- Yeah, good idea.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.167
All right, folks,
this one is on the house.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.435
So... is everything okay?

22:32.519 --> 22:35.029
- Yeah, look, um...

22:35.064 --> 22:37.108
Listen, okay,
so we just lost Uncle Pete,

22:37.191 --> 22:40.777
and part of me says
let's respect that.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.571
(piano playing)

22:42.654 --> 22:45.866
But part of me thinks,
listen, we got a lot of-

22:45.949 --> 22:47.659
we have a few decisions,
big decisions to make

22:47.742 --> 22:49.411
that affect all of us.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.746
So maybe we just get on with it
and start talking about...

22:51.830 --> 22:53.790
- Okay, Horace, Sylvi,

22:53.874 --> 22:56.793
I think I should...
lay it on the line.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.837
All right, I said some stuff yesterday,

22:58.920 --> 23:01.548
you know,
trying to be a tough guy

23:01.631 --> 23:03.717
when I said...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.552
"I don't care
if you sell this place,

23:05.635 --> 23:07.929
I don't need this, I'll be okay
without this. "

23:07.964 --> 23:10.557
Well, I won't.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.520
I just won't, so please,
please don't sell it, Horace.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.814
Please.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.566
And Sylvi, don't make him.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.693
I know he doesn't like
to say no to you.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.778
I mean, yeah, I'm in my 50s

23:23.862 --> 23:25.906
and I've never lived
anywhere else.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.367
I've never worked
anyplace else, I...

23:29.451 --> 23:32.371
I mean, this place
and our family

23:33.455 --> 23:34.873
is my life.

23:34.956 --> 23:38.835
So, I mean,
Uncle Pete was my dad

23:38.919 --> 23:40.795
and I- I never even knew it.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.799
So you guys are all I have.

23:44.883 --> 23:48.054
And I don't know what I'll do.

23:48.137 --> 23:51.848
And I know it sounds like
I'm begging,

23:51.932 --> 23:53.267
and I guess I am, but...

23:53.351 --> 23:56.103
And I'm ashamed.

23:56.187 --> 23:58.189
But I don't have a choice.

23:58.272 --> 24:01.816
- Pete, Sylvia is very sick.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.819
- I know that, don't you think
I've taken that into account?

24:04.903 --> 24:06.696
I know that.
- She's also broke.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.698
- Horace...
- And she doesn't have

24:08.782 --> 24:09.408
enough money to pay her bills
or her rent.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.868
- Thanks, Horace,
stop please.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.662
- Yeah, well,
that's what's going on!

24:13.745 --> 24:14.288
You're here trying
to close the place

24:14.372 --> 24:16.706
'cause you need the money.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.751
Okay? And yes...

24:19.834 --> 24:22.671
Pete won't have any place to work or
live without this place

24:22.754 --> 24:23.422
or anywhere to get his pills.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.840
- Right, so you're pitting
his needs against mine.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.509
- Yeah, and yours against his,

24:27.592 --> 24:30.470
because that's what
this is... guys.

24:30.553 --> 24:31.097
And there's no good answer.

24:31.180 --> 24:33.307
- Well, then why don't we sell
this fucking place?

24:33.391 --> 24:37.477
If you want, we'll split it three ways,
I don't care.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.854
- But what about this place?

24:41.273 --> 24:44.943
What about it? I mean, this-
this place has been here

24:44.978 --> 24:45.236
for a hundred years.

24:45.319 --> 24:48.114
Do you know
what that means, Sylvia?

24:48.197 --> 24:50.032
- When World War II ended,

24:50.116 --> 24:52.909
people came in here
to celebrate.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.954
All right, during Prohibition,
the first Horace and Pete

24:55.989 --> 24:58.082
sold near-beer
and corned beef sandwiches

24:58.165 --> 25:00.709
just to keep it open.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.669
You know how many bad times
this place got through,

25:02.752 --> 25:04.671
and we're just gonna sell it?

25:04.754 --> 25:07.841
What about all those traditions?
- Fuck all of that, Pete.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.885
They're all dead, all of them.
They're gone.

25:10.969 --> 25:11.303
We don't have to hang on

25:11.387 --> 25:13.097
to any of that fucking
bullshit for them.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.391
They are gone.
We are here.

25:15.474 --> 25:18.643
We have need.

25:18.727 --> 25:21.855
- Okay, so we sell the place
and then it's gone.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.315
And then we have a little bit of money
and then- and then what?

25:23.399 --> 25:26.693
- Horace...
- I got another idea.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.696
(chuckling)
Okay.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.282
What if we split it three ways,
like she's saying,

25:31.365 --> 25:33.867
but we keep it open?

25:33.950 --> 25:35.202
- Oh, fuck.

25:35.286 --> 25:38.330
- Yeah, like come in with us
is what I'm saying, Sylvi.

25:38.414 --> 25:40.915
Help us run it.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.293
Live upstairs and I'll take care of you
while you're sick

25:42.376 --> 25:44.010
and you'll get better,

25:44.045 --> 25:46.963
and then you help us turn
this place into something.

25:46.998 --> 25:48.715
- That's never gonna...

25:48.798 --> 25:50.468
It's always been just
the two guys, Horace and Pete.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.303
- Yeah, well, fuck that,
like she said.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.346
They're dead, they're all gone,
and it's just us.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.140
It's just the three of us, okay?

25:56.223 --> 25:59.185
So I'm saying, bring her in.
Turn it into something new.

25:59.268 --> 26:02.021
- Horace, I don't want that.
I don't wanna run a fucking bar.

26:02.104 --> 26:06.733
- Well, it's an option, Sylvia,
and you don't have a lot, okay?

26:06.816 --> 26:08.152
And I don't care if he's
our cousin or he's our brother,

26:08.235 --> 26:10.154
but I'm not- I'm not throwing him out
on the street for you.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.114
Or for myself.
- To live in Brooklyn again?

26:12.198 --> 26:15.451
- Yeah, Brooklyn's coming up,
remember?

26:15.534 --> 26:18.828
Sylvia, I don't care what
we turn it into,

26:18.912 --> 26:19.455
but this one we could do together.

26:19.538 --> 26:22.458
I mean, fuck the Horace and Pete shit
right now.

26:22.541 --> 26:25.710
Take the pictures down
and let's change the name

26:25.794 --> 26:26.504
and let's just- let's-
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:27.587 --> 26:28.339
Leave it just-
leave it the way it is.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.216
Keep everything exactly
the way it is.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.343
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to start a new business?

26:32.426 --> 26:35.845
Just leave it-
leave it like it is.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.140
- Okay.

26:38.224 --> 26:42.228
- Um, just for the record, Sylvia,

26:42.311 --> 26:44.396
I would-
I would really love that.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.066
To have you here, I mean.

26:47.149 --> 26:49.360
Maybe it means something
and maybe it doesn't,

26:49.443 --> 26:53.030
but I- I miss, you know...

26:53.114 --> 26:55.698
- What good am I gonna be
to anybody here?

26:55.782 --> 26:57.034
I'm a mess,
I'm, you know, I have cancer.

26:57.118 --> 26:59.370
- Sylv- not for long.
I mean, come on.

26:59.453 --> 27:01.372
Come on, Sylvi,
you're gonna be fine.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.748
I feel bad for the cancer.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.792
Fuck that.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.961
- I don't know, Horace,
I don't know if I can do it.

27:07.996 --> 27:08.420
I don't know
if I'd want to do it.

27:08.504 --> 27:10.755
I don't know if I can do it.

27:10.839 --> 27:13.967
I got to go.

27:14.002 --> 27:14.301
Yeah.

27:16.803 --> 27:17.304
(Marsha sighs)

27:19.722 --> 27:20.141
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.478
See you later.
- Yeah.

27:24.562 --> 27:26.272
- You're gonna be okay.
- Thanks.

27:39.535 --> 27:41.495
- You just came up with that.

27:41.579 --> 27:44.873
And you sprung it on me.
- Mm-hmm.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.916
- I mean, you didn't consult me
before- bef...

27:46.951 --> 27:47.501
- No, I didn't.

27:50.004 --> 27:52.797
She probably won't do it anyway.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.175
- And if she doesn't, then what?

27:54.258 --> 27:57.719
- Then I'll- I'll have to sell
the place, Pete.

28:07.146 --> 28:10.149
- I mean, the fucking Internet is the
worst thing in the world.

28:10.232 --> 28:12.817
It's ruining everything,
you know.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.153
I- I hate the Internet.

28:14.236 --> 28:17.906
- So turn it off.

28:17.989 --> 28:20.950
You can turn the Internet off,
you know that, right?

28:20.985 --> 28:22.328
- Yeah, the Internet's got
an on/off switch.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.704
Not like life.

28:24.787 --> 28:25.497
Life just has an off switch.

28:25.581 --> 28:27.541
Which is still pretty cool.

28:27.625 --> 28:30.009
You can punch out
whenever you want, you know.

28:30.044 --> 28:33.214
And the interesting thing is,
no matter how bad life gets,

28:33.297 --> 28:36.175
most people will not flick
that switch, you know?

28:36.258 --> 28:38.885
Even in the most-

28:38.968 --> 28:41.013
actually, especially in the most
miserable time and place,

28:41.096 --> 28:43.015
most people choose
to participate

28:43.098 --> 28:45.412
when they do not have to.

28:45.447 --> 28:47.727
- Just like the Internet.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.730
- Or look at it like Syria,
that ain't gonna get no better.

28:50.813 --> 28:51.190
Those people got no future.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.193
It's ISIS and poison gas
for the lot of 'em.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.862
But you don't hear
about any mass suicides there.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.906
Why don't they all just
kill themselves?

28:59.989 --> 29:00.998
- Imagine if one night,

29:01.033 --> 29:03.993
everyone in the world
killed themselves.

29:05.162 --> 29:07.956
Even babies.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.961
Imagine a baby killing himself.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.716
- I saw a baby
kill himself once.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.511
- Well, good for the baby,
you know.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.137
At least he didn't
stick around complaining

29:22.221 --> 29:25.391
about how bad his baby life was,
like some people.

29:25.474 --> 29:27.601
Holy shit, that annoys me.

29:27.685 --> 29:30.229
Every time someone complains
about their shitty life,

29:30.312 --> 29:32.606
I'm like, "Hey, why don't you
just get the fuck out?

29:32.690 --> 29:35.192
"No one's keeping you here, okay?

29:35.276 --> 29:37.860
Just go. "

29:37.944 --> 29:38.696
I will never understand that,

29:39.779 --> 29:42.616
why more people with bad lives
don't just peace the fuck out.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.495
- Because maybe
it'll get better.
