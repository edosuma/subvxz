37:21.127 --> 37:23.162
Yeah. Well, Bruce's body
isn't on the ship, so...

37:23.163 --> 37:25.930
MONITOR: No, but you are.

37:32.171 --> 37:36.108
I said the path to Earth-99
would lead you to the Paragon,

37:36.109 --> 37:39.011
and that has come to pass.

37:39.012 --> 37:42.448
You are the Bat of
the future, Kate Kane.

37:42.449 --> 37:45.650
You are the Paragon of Courage.

38:09.508 --> 38:11.643
- Huh.
- What?!

38:11.644 --> 38:13.881
It's, uh... something's wrong.

38:13.882 --> 38:16.749
This has, uh... this has
never happened before.

38:16.750 --> 38:20.586
With all the anti-matter in the system,

38:20.587 --> 38:23.322
I've lost my magical mojo.

BARRY: If we can't get Oliver's
soul back, he's gonna be

38:25.659 --> 38:27.593
a... monster forever.

38:27.594 --> 38:29.027
Yeah.

38:40.572 --> 38:42.541
Do these things even work on you?

38:42.542 --> 38:44.710
Not really,

38:44.711 --> 38:47.513
but you looked like you
could use a drinking buddy.

38:47.514 --> 38:48.746
Yeah.

38:53.719 --> 38:56.922
Time travelers, Aliens.

38:56.923 --> 39:01.193
I've barely even started
this whole vigilante thing.

39:01.194 --> 39:03.062
How am I a Paragon?

39:03.063 --> 39:05.364
I've seen you in action.

39:05.365 --> 39:07.466
You saved me,

39:07.467 --> 39:09.502
and last year, you saved

39:09.503 --> 39:10.993
Oliver and Barry's asses,

39:10.994 --> 39:12.571
thank you very much.

39:12.572 --> 39:14.238
- Accurate.
- Heh.

39:16.642 --> 39:20.279
How much you care, how hard you try,

39:20.280 --> 39:22.748
those are the things that make you hero,

39:22.749 --> 39:26.251
not powers or time travel,

39:26.252 --> 39:29.324
and you may not feel like
you have the experience now,

39:29.325 --> 39:31.557
but you have the heart.

39:31.558 --> 39:33.258
You're one of the bravest people I know.

39:33.259 --> 39:35.127
That Bruce was brave once, too,

39:35.128 --> 39:37.963
and he had heart.

39:37.964 --> 39:40.132
What if I end up like him?

39:40.133 --> 39:41.732
You won't.

39:44.069 --> 39:45.670
You'll make your own destiny.

39:48.974 --> 39:52.510
I found this in his library.

39:56.415 --> 39:58.083
That's Beth and me.

39:58.084 --> 40:00.518
From Earth-99.

40:03.522 --> 40:06.125
I wish I knew her like this.

40:06.126 --> 40:07.291
Maybe you still can.

40:09.928 --> 40:12.392
Sounds like the Paragon of
Hope just got her hope back.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.226
Ohh.

40:17.136 --> 40:20.539
Hope, help, and compassion for all.

40:20.540 --> 40:24.143
That's what I'm gonna do for Earth-38.

40:24.144 --> 40:26.047
But Earth-38 is gone.

40:26.048 --> 40:28.046
I know,

40:28.047 --> 40:33.385
but maybe I can use the Book
of Destiny to bring it back.

40:33.386 --> 40:36.013
The Monitor said that would
be really dangerous, Kara.

40:36.014 --> 40:38.147
I know what he said...

40:39.725 --> 40:41.663
But what good is being
the Paragon of Hope

40:41.664 --> 40:43.297
if I don't have any?

With every death, I steal
my mirror's strength,
