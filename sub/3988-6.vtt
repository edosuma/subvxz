(music playing )

01:34.220 --> 01:37.053
J‘ In my hands J‘

01:37.223 --> 01:41.512
J‘ I hold the ashes J‘

01:41.686 --> 01:44.678
J‘ In my veins J‘

01:44.855 --> 01:47.517
J‘ Black pitch runs J‘

01:49.193 --> 01:52.026
J‘ In my chest J‘

01:52.196 --> 01:55.313
J‘ Fire catches J‘

01:56.742 --> 02:00.075
J‘ In my wayJ‘

02:00.246 --> 02:02.828
J‘ The setting sun J‘

J‘ Dark clouds J‘

J‘ Gather around me J‘

02:11.674 --> 02:14.711
J‘ To the west J‘

02:14.885 --> 02:17.718
J‘ My soul is bound J‘

02:19.348 --> 02:22.385
J‘ But I will go J‘

02:22.560 --> 02:25.723
J‘ On ahead free J‘

02:27.023 --> 02:29.560
J‘ There's a light J‘

02:30.776 --> 02:34.735
J‘ Yet to be found J‘

02:34.905 --> 02:40.616
J‘ The last pale light

02:40.786 --> 02:44.574
Governor: I've been on the road
for a couple of months.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.865
Woman #1:
By yourself?

02:47.043 --> 02:48.749
Governor:
Yeah.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.496
Woman #2:
Where did you live before that?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.756
Governor:
l was in a town.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.383
Woman #1:
Were the monsters there?

02:58.554 --> 03:01.170
Governor:
No.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.305
It was safe.

03:03.476 --> 03:06.218
Full of good people.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.809
Woman #1:
What happened?

03:10.983 --> 03:13.941
Governor:
He just lost it.

03:15.488 --> 03:17.444
Woman #2:
Who?

03:19.283 --> 03:21.615
Governor:
The man in charge.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.656
I barely got out alive.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.791
J‘And | ask J‘

03:30.961 --> 03:33.623
J‘ For no redemption J‘

03:35.466 --> 03:38.458
J‘ In this cold J‘

03:38.636 --> 03:41.469
J‘ And barren place J‘

03:43.057 --> 03:46.220
J‘ Still I see J‘

03:46.394 --> 03:49.010
J‘ A faint reflection J‘

03:50.898 --> 03:52.889
J‘And so by it J‘

03:54.527 --> 03:56.768
J‘ Guide my way J‘

03:58.656 --> 04:01.989
J‘ The last pale light J‘

04:02.159 --> 04:03.990
J‘ In the west J‘

04:06.288 --> 04:09.416
J‘ The last pale light J‘

04:09.583 --> 04:11.539
J‘ In the west. J‘

( gun hammer clicks)

05:19.403 --> 05:22.691
(theme music playing )

05:57.358 --> 05:59.269
Woman #2: You look like
you barely got out alive.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.944
- Woman: Tara.
- Tara: I mean...

06:01.111 --> 06:02.772
Woman:
We're a little on edge.

06:02.947 --> 06:05.609
We've been holed up in here
waiting for the National Guard since--

06:05.783 --> 06:07.364
- The shit hit the fan.
-Language.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.322
Since the crap hit the fan.

06:10.496 --> 06:14.614
Which it did, right before it got flung
all over the damn place.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.458
Are you planning
on staying in the building?

06:25.386 --> 06:28.093
Are you planning on staying or not?

06:29.932 --> 06:32.218
- Holy shit, with the no talking.
- Tara.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.305
My sister asked you a question.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.310
Just for the night.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.393
You see this?

06:40.568 --> 06:44.607
This here is a fully loaded,
standard issue Smith & Wesson.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.362
l'm Atlanta City Police and l have
enough artillery in here

06:47.533 --> 06:50.616
to kill you every day
for the next 10 years.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.320
You mess with me or my family,

06:54.498 --> 06:56.659
and I swear to Christ,
I will put you down.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.826
Got it?

07:00.004 --> 07:02.040
Got it.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.080
Then we're cool.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.499
Poundit

07:12.099 --> 07:13.600
Here, bro.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.559
We'll hold onto this until you go.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.096
Yeah.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.149
You got a name?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.948
Brian.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.160
Brian Heriot.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.967
( knocks )

08:09.198 --> 08:11.439
You got to be hungry.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.194
You're not gonna find
anything better in there.

08:16.372 --> 08:20.240
Tara ransacked the place
after Miss Wilhelm took off for Florida.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.748
Big fan of butter beans,
Miss Wilhelm.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.009
Thank you.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.376
...four, five.

09:14.555 --> 09:18.468
Come on, kiddo.
Show me what you got here.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.438
Woman:
Everything okay?

09:33.157 --> 09:35.569
She didn't eat again.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.155
She likes the corned beef.
Try that.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.829
I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.828
She's not picky, she's terrified.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.990
- ( floorboards creak )
- Shh.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.834
- ( floorboards creak )
- ( gun hammer clicks)

09:54.344 --> 09:56.050
Why don't you slow down,
buddy, all right?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.472
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.300
Bucket on the left is for washing,

09:59.475 --> 10:01.511
right is for rinsing.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.676
Tara.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.811
Oh.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.692
Sorry.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.035
You get enough to eat?

10:22.206 --> 10:24.037
(man coughing)

10:26.001 --> 10:27.866
I'll get you some coffee.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.707
Sit down.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.667
Right there. Go on.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.929
Man:
Go ahead, roll again.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.762
Hey, come here.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.023
You got a cigarette?

10:51.193 --> 10:52.774
Woman:
Dad, your oxygen tank.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.357
Do you not see that red sticker?

10:55.531 --> 10:58.898
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra Menthol
is gonna blow this place up

10:59.076 --> 11:01.488
after all the work we've done
to stay alive up here. Okay?

11:01.662 --> 11:03.493
It's all the same, Lily.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.825
You can stop that talk right there.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.206
It's just a cigarette.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.876
Help yourself.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.288
We got roni sticks for days.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.422
Years, probably.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.925
You see that big truck parked outside?

11:19.096 --> 11:22.213
Come on, dude,
the Gorbelli food truck.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.179
Ray Charles could have seen it.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.684
Yeah.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.564
Dad drove for them.
Even with the tank.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.269
The day they closed down the 75--

11:33.443 --> 11:35.820
When the S-H-l-T
hit the fan.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.071
He grabbed Megan from school,
picked me up at the hospital--

11:39.241 --> 11:41.857
She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks
from that dump.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.946
Then the three of us
rushed over to get Tara.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.079
l was at the station working, booking.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.826
With everything going on,

11:53.005 --> 11:56.964
the attacks,
the Army going into Atlanta,

11:57.134 --> 11:59.466
he wasn't about to let us
out of his sight.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.796
Tara:
Lucky for us, the old man's truck

12:00.971 --> 12:03.633
was pretty much stocked floor to ceiling
with sketti rings,

12:03.807 --> 12:07.425
turkey chili, and these little suckers.

12:07.603 --> 12:11.596
Man:
Meg, Granddad needs a break, okay?

12:11.773 --> 12:14.264
- Lily.
- Sure, Daddy.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.779
On three.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.610
A little help here, big guy.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.068
Lily:
Here.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.157
Oh, right.
No, not you.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.993
The other big guy in the room.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.909
Lily:
Tara.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.077
- ( groaning)
- Lily: Okay.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.665
On three.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.331
Okay, one, two--

12:50.187 --> 12:52.303
Here. Here.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.849
( footsteps )

12:57.027 --> 12:59.985
- ( floorboards creak )
- Hey. You hear them?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.736
Yeah.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.193
Yeah.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.201
Get my legs, friend?

13:09.623 --> 13:14.287
Tara's been up there a bunch of times
blasting them bastards to pieces.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.204
She says they just
keep getting back up.

13:18.382 --> 13:21.419
I told her no more.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.209
Can't afford to waste her bullets.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.640
(coughs)

13:29.309 --> 13:30.810
You got kids?

13:31.937 --> 13:34.178
No.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.472
When my girls were born,

13:36.650 --> 13:39.858
that's when I finally figured out
what it was to be a man.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.110
You know, a real man.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.861
(coughs)

13:44.032 --> 13:46.239
You protect them,
you keep them safe.

13:46.410 --> 13:50.574
You just try to make them stronger
until they can look out for themselves.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.238
But this here,

13:53.417 --> 13:56.534
|-- I never counted on this.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.246
Hey, I got a buddy.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.507
Bill Jenkins,
he lives up in 303.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.919
He's got a real nice
backgammon set up there.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.258
He won't mind and he keeps it
under his bed there.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.721
Just... please.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.475
You've been out there in the world

14:14.646 --> 14:18.013
and you know how to handle
yourself around those things.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.056
Look, I know you might
not understand it

14:20.235 --> 14:22.100
'cause you don't got
a baby girl of your own,

14:22.279 --> 14:24.110
but...
(coughs)

14:25.490 --> 14:28.482
it might be something that might make
my Megan talk again.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.860
Please.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.832
( rustling )

15:57.207 --> 15:59.949
(snarling )

16:47.465 --> 16:49.922
( door opens)

17:05.275 --> 17:06.856
Thank you.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.321
You're welcome.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.089
Couple things for the road.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.516
I'm okay.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.769
You helped us.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.895
We're saying thank you.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.852
Deal with it.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.529
I guess you'll be needing this back.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.536
Keep it.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.078
Don't...

18:44.249 --> 18:46.365
throw that at me.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.378
It's your gun.
You can have it back.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.164
You need another one.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.878
l have this.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.681
Tara was right.
We should have frisked you.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.558
I found it upstairs.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.229
You keep that.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.984
You have to kill the brain.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.568
What?

19:19.743 --> 19:22.405
Your sister,
she shot 'em in the body,

19:22.579 --> 19:25.070
but you have to hit 'em here.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.534
That's what kills them.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.040
Why?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.423
I need to ask you something.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.755
My dad's got stage four lung cancer.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.264
I worked oncology for a few years.

19:45.435 --> 19:48.222
He's nearing the end.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.770
He's got about two days of oxygen.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.444
Maybe less.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.646
We never thought
he'd make it this long.

19:59.824 --> 20:03.362
You've already done
so much for us, but...

20:05.080 --> 20:09.119
There's an old folks home
a couple of blocks from here.

20:09.292 --> 20:13.285
Even one tank
would mean everything.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.375
He's the only one who can
put a smile on Megan's face...

20:18.051 --> 20:20.042
...even for a second.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.706
(snarling )

21:48.892 --> 21:50.883
(snarling )

22:25.011 --> 22:28.048
(snarling )

22:31.059 --> 22:32.799
(snarling )

22:35.647 --> 22:37.308
(scratching )

22:37.482 --> 22:40.064
(snarling )

22:42.111 --> 22:44.102
(walkers snarling )

22:56.960 --> 22:59.451
(snarling grows louder)

23:06.469 --> 23:08.755
(walkers snarling )

23:12.809 --> 23:14.094
(grunts)

23:16.938 --> 23:18.678
(gunshot)

23:36.082 --> 23:37.697
( knocks )

23:40.753 --> 23:43.495
- They're both full.
- Are you okay?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.163
Yeah.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.797
(pills rattling)

23:56.269 --> 23:59.511
( door creaks open )

24:05.028 --> 24:06.859
You didn't let me say thank you.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.066
Yeah, I'm okay.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.946
Sit.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.828
Let me be a nurse again.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.883
Good news is it doesn't look like
you need any stitches.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.806
Bad news...

24:39.604 --> 24:42.095
this is gonna sting like
a couple of angry bees.

24:51.074 --> 24:53.531
Feels good to have something to do.

24:53.701 --> 24:57.444
Nobody ever mentioned just how boring
the end of the world was gonna be.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.664
( blowing )

25:21.354 --> 25:24.846
She thought you were her dad.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.525
Megan.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.435
When she saw you
out there on the street.

25:32.657 --> 25:35.774
He went out one night about
three and a half years ago

25:35.952 --> 25:38.238
to get a couple beers
and a Powerball ticket.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.404
Said he'd be right back.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.453
Megan thought you were him,

25:45.628 --> 25:48.961
finally coming right back.

25:52.844 --> 25:55.005
- Megan: Mama.
- ln here, honey.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.975
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

26:01.936 --> 26:05.303
Brian just got a boo-boo
that needs a little cleaning up.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.437
Same as when you get a cut.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.450
I don't have the ointment.

26:20.997 --> 26:23.864
Why don't you watch
my patient until I get back?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.702
Okay.

26:38.306 --> 26:41.844
- What happened to your eye?
- It's gone.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.262
Something happen to you
or were you just born like that?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.271
Something happened to me.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.735
Was that bad to ask?

26:59.994 --> 27:01.700
No.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.707
I'll tell you what happened to my eye,

27:08.878 --> 27:11.085
but you have to promise
to keep it secret.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.005
I promise.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.173
What's that?

27:19.347 --> 27:20.837
Pinkie swear.

27:28.731 --> 27:32.019
Plus cross my heart
and hope to die.

27:35.530 --> 27:37.395
Well...

27:39.075 --> 27:40.736
I'm a pirate.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.650
No way.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.241
(laughing)

27:49.502 --> 27:51.288
Yeah, you caught me.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.920
What really happened was
I was trying to help someone.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.586
Someone I loved very much.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.096
How were you trying
to help them?

28:05.768 --> 28:08.805
l was trying to protect them,
you know?

28:08.980 --> 28:11.642
Stop them getting hurt.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.522
But you got hurt instead.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.524
Yeah.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.987
Did they get hurt, too?

28:20.157 --> 28:22.148
Uh...

28:22.326 --> 28:24.282
yeah, yeah, they did.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.280
I'm sorry.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.368
Me, too.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.136
Megan:
What is it?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.797
Chess.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.636
Looks hard.

28:47.810 --> 28:52.053
Well, maybe for some folks,
but you're smart.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.607
You'll catch on quick.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.389
What's this one called?

28:55.568 --> 28:57.604
That's a pawn.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.110
They're your soldiers.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.697
Do they die?

29:03.868 --> 29:05.904
Sometimes.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.330
Do you lose if they die?

29:08.497 --> 29:10.658
No, not necessarily.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.831
You can lose a lot of soldiers,
but still win the game.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.049
That's the king.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.970
That's the guy you want to capture.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.360
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.991
Looks like you.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.034
Yeah.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.245
( chuckles )

30:00.925 --> 30:02.881
Come on, let's play.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.254
So these ones are pawns.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.397
Lily:
He's gone.

31:04.572 --> 31:07.939
I think he's been gone a while.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.284
(crying)

31:12.455 --> 31:14.411
Y'all should go now.

31:14.582 --> 31:16.823
Just give us a minute.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.119
I love you, Daddy.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.881
(growling)

31:27.261 --> 31:29.092
- ( gasps )
- Lily: Tara!

31:31.474 --> 31:33.465
- Tara: Stop! What are you doing?
- It's not Dad!

31:33.642 --> 31:34.893
- Stop!
- It's not Dad!

31:35.061 --> 31:36.392
( Megan screams )

32:55.891 --> 32:59.258
I know, okay?

32:59.436 --> 33:02.143
It happens no matter what?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.020
Yeah.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.565
I'm sorry.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.400
He could have got me.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.074
He almost got me.

33:19.582 --> 33:22.244
lwas thinking

33:22.418 --> 33:25.330
he would have been grateful or whatever

33:25.504 --> 33:28.246
that you stopped him, from him--

33:28.424 --> 33:30.710
you know what I mean?

33:38.267 --> 33:40.258
So, yeah, we're cool.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.638
( shatters )

35:11.277 --> 35:12.858
( knocks )

35:15.656 --> 35:17.192
Good-bye.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.197
No.

35:19.368 --> 35:20.983
- We're coming with you.
- No.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.994
There has to be someplace better
and you're gonna help us find it.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.870
- Lily.
- I saw the picture, Brian.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.782
You had a family, I know that.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.327
And I know we're not them.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.336
But for now, you're stuck with us.

35:33.507 --> 35:36.214
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.
- I can't.

35:36.385 --> 35:38.876
You already have.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.605
Tara:
Where should we go?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.766
Governor:
No use making a plan.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.650
We'll go where they let us.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.777
Who's they?

35:57.948 --> 36:00.030
The roads.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.065
The biters.

36:04.413 --> 36:07.200
I'm not really a cop.

36:07.374 --> 36:11.743
I mean, it's not a total lie.
I was in the academy.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.672
I'm sorry I lied to you.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.586
You don't have to be sorry.

36:21.764 --> 36:23.800
Well, lam.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.308
Do you think we can make it?

36:31.565 --> 36:33.601
We'll make it.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.601
Are you lying to me?

36:40.824 --> 36:42.780
No.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.721
Lily:
You can comejoin us, Megan.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.640
It's just gonna take some time.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.896
It's okay.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.890
(engine grinding)

38:55.542 --> 38:56.873
Governor:
We'll find another car soon.

38:57.044 --> 38:58.750
Tara:
I hope you're right.

38:58.921 --> 39:01.583
This whole country backdrop
is reminding me of Sam.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.590
- Lily: Here we go.
- I thought she was the one.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.342
Then you went camping,
ate mushrooms, game over.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.049
You're forgetting the part where Sam
broke down

39:09.223 --> 39:12.260
and told me she had a boyfriend,
that she wasn't really into chicks.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.925
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.435
- ( crow caws )
- Tara.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.392
Oh, man. Damn it!

39:19.566 --> 39:21.648
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.434
- Tara, stop. Let me look at it.
- I'm fine!

39:24.613 --> 39:27.400
Just hand me my backpack.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:27.574 --> 39:30.156
( groans )

39:32.454 --> 39:35.446
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:35.624 --> 39:39.287
( metal squeaking )

39:39.461 --> 39:40.962
I'm fine. Let's go.

39:41.129 --> 39:44.166
- ( metal squeaking )
- ( walkers growling )

39:48.595 --> 39:52.053
Drop your bags.
Let's go. Come on.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.761
- Tara: Megan.
- Megan, come on.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.471
Megan, right now.
Come on.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.727
- Megan!
- Come on, Megan.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.683
Megan, come on.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.813
Megan, right now.
Come on.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.148
Come on, Megan.
Come on.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.191
Lily:
Megan!

40:17.457 --> 40:18.867
Governor:
Here.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.907
Come on.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.840
Go.

40:26.008 --> 40:27.873
Move.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.615
- Ah!
- ( Megan screams )

40:57.789 --> 41:00.622
- Brian!
- I'm here.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.994
( distant machine gunfire)

41:08.717 --> 41:10.048
( screams )

41:12.304 --> 41:14.295
( screams )

41:21.188 --> 41:23.053
( distant machine gunfire)

41:25.233 --> 41:26.518
(whimpers)

41:26.693 --> 41:28.900
( distant machine gunfire)

41:30.572 --> 41:31.732
( screams )

41:32.741 --> 41:34.527
(grunting)

41:40.999 --> 41:42.239
( panting )

41:46.755 --> 41:49.087
I'm sorry. You okay?

41:49.257 --> 41:51.919
You all right?

41:52.094 --> 41:54.210
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

41:54.388 --> 41:56.424
Okay?

42:02.604 --> 42:05.937
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.772
Holy shit.

42:15.659 --> 42:17.650
Cross my heart.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.910
(theme music playing )
