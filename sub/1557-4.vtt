Turn that bathtub
into a swim-up bar.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.878
I'm just saying
we could have been.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.546
In two hotel rooms
this entire time.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.881
Okay.
Wait.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.083
[ door closes ]
so, dad put us through hell
for nothing?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.351
Do you guys hear that?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.854
The sound of my hero
falling off his pedestal?

15:22.856 --> 15:23.855
Uh, no.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.923
The sound of your hero.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.958
Playing with the nigerians
in the pool.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.562
Okay, so,
when I say "Marco"...

15:31.564 --> 15:32.931
Hi, Marco.
No, no, I'm phil.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.632
I'm gonna say "Marco"
and then...

15:34.634 --> 15:35.767
Hi, phil.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.135
Let's take it
from the top.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.403
I'm gonna close my eyes.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.038
No, no, not...
not you, ayoola.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.205
You keep your eyes open.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.607
Can you open...
Marco!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.375
No, uh, iyapo,
can you stay in the pool?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.411
That way,
when I say "Marco"...
hi, Marco.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.779
Come on.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.048
He has a room to himself,
and that's what he's doing?

15:50.050 --> 15:52.383
I mean, he's basically
a hyperactive toddler.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.751
That just wants
to play all the time.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.286
[ chuckles ] yeah.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.556
Although it's really
more about wanting to
spend time with us.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.458
It's kind of all dad
ever wants.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.060
That's true.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.662
He's, like,
obsessed with us.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.397
Do you think he lied
about the hotel being booked.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.966
Just so we'd all
have to spend time together?

16:07.968 --> 16:10.601
And we
totally ditched him.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.805
Even after he jumped
on that sex grenade for us.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.974
[ door opens ]
oops.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.744
[ chuckles ] butterfingers.
I spilled my wine in the tub.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.579
Would you mind,
sweetie?

16:23.282 --> 16:24.649
What?

Cameron: 40 short yards,
6 long seconds.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.155
We've got this.
On three, "go, dolphins."

16:31.157 --> 16:33.925
Two, three...
Together: Go, dolphins!

16:33.927 --> 16:35.960
All right, Manny,
this is a real hail mary.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.262
Win or lose, I still have
a hot girlfriend.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.497
Huh?

Boom!
<i>Touchdown, dolphins!</i>

16:48.108 --> 16:50.641
[ cheers and applause ]
we won! Mitchell, we won!

16:50.643 --> 16:53.444
Oh!

16:53.446 --> 16:56.347
Oh, no!

16:57.950 --> 16:59.951
Mitchell: Hello?
Mitchell, we won!

16:59.953 --> 17:01.019
And I looked back,
and you weren't there!

17:01.021 --> 17:02.720
Please don't be
mad at me.

17:02.722 --> 17:03.955
I'm on the fence.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.323
I don't blame you.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.159
I feel stupid for making you
think this was all your fault.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.061
No! I'm on the fence.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.696
Look to your right.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.065
Huh?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.867
Oh!

17:15.868 --> 17:17.801
Hi.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.137
I was trying to leave,

17:19.138 --> 17:20.872
And then I got stuck
on this fence.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.205
With... my...
my pant leg is...

17:22.208 --> 17:23.674
What were you thinking?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.009
We both know
you're not a good climber.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.176
Well, I know that.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.244
There's a parking lot
right over there.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.813
I'm parked over here.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.715
Sit right... sit right...
sit right there.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.383
Sit right there.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.818
Okay, okay, put me down.
Two, three.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.486
[ exhales sharply ]
you don't have
to throw me.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.554
[ exhales sharply ]

17:36.556 --> 17:38.489
Look, I... I get why
you don't want me here.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.324
I-I know there's
no such thing as bad luck,

17:40.326 --> 17:41.993
But there...
there is bad energy,

17:41.995 --> 17:44.429
And I bring a lot of that
to your whole sports world.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.998
And that's... that's because
of my own history with it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.433
And [sighs]
you deserve better.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.934
I couldn't do better.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.169
You know what?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.938
Why can't we look at sports
like one of those friends.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.107
That one of us likes
and the other doesn't?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.341
Sports can be
like your mom.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.743
Oh.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.877
[ chuckles ]

17:59.879 --> 18:01.579
You know,
actually, I-I didn't hate this.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.347
Oh, shut up.
No, I didn't.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.383
I-I was kind of getting
into the whole football culture.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.851
There is an elegance
that this has...

18:06.853 --> 18:09.253
Aah!
No!

18:09.255 --> 18:11.255
[ laughter ]
no! This is vicuna!

Hey. Great game, champ.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.230
Thanks.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.264
You okay?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.200
Yeah,
just a little tired.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.068
It was a big day.
Good night.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.703
Night, kid.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.905
Hey, wait a second.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.074
Your team
just won six straight.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.476
Let's celebrate
with a little scotch.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.111
You're old enough
for your first sip.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.912
She dumped me, jay.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.081
Okay,
we're gonna do this.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.550
She was just using me to make
her old boyfriend jealous.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.285
Now they're back together.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.787
Don't tell mom, okay?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.156
I had a sense
she didn't like sam.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.290
Really?
She didn't say anything.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.726
[ exhales sharply ]
my first girlfriend.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.161
She was perfect.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.329
Eh, a little wide
in the can.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.331
Jay.
I'm sorry. Just...

18:53.333 --> 18:54.398
You ask me,
you're lucky.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.500
She dumped me by text.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.602
While making out
with her old boyfriend.

18:57.604 --> 19:01.405
I broke down crying.
My charcoal ran like mascara.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.742
I had to be comforted
by the other team's mascot.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.344
Lucky?
Think about it.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.147
How many guys your age
would kill.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.149
To be used
by a girl like sam?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.416
She picked you.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.684
She used you.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.120
I was a body, jay.
Come on.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.289
If she had picked
an average guy,

19:18.291 --> 19:21.259
That boyfriend
never would have got jealous.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.828
She had to pick a guy
on his level.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.530
Yeah. Maybe.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.298
Oh, I'm not gonna
lie to you.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.135
It sucks, and sometimes
it's got to suck for a while.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.671
I just wish I could say
some magic words.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.274
Or give you a hug...
make it all go away.

of that scotch like you said?

Okay,
I just opened a bottle,

A beautiful 18-year-old,

It is the creepiest thing.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.126
I'm sure it's just,
I don't know,

21:02.128 --> 21:03.561
Some guy's car broke down
and he wants to use our phone.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.563

seen a movie?

how sad I was.

left the hotel room?

Phil, what is on
the other side of that door?

21:12.138 --> 21:13.704
Hi, Marco.
Hey, guys.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.239
It's possible
they misunderstood me.

"you guys should stop by."
