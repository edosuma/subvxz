01:34.108 --> 01:38.137
How can you call it a ski weekend
if we're going home at dawn on Sunday?

01:38.305 --> 01:40.196
Got to leave early
to beat the traffic.

01:40.321 --> 01:42.297
Now, to get on route 205,

01:42.422 --> 01:44.359
and it's a straight shot home.

01:46.544 --> 01:48.188
For crying out...!

01:49.884 --> 01:53.243
I hate traffic:
the band and the phenomenon.

01:53.528 --> 01:55.655
There's only one game
we can play in the car

01:55.780 --> 01:58.336
over and over
and over again: Bonk it.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.718
I'm sorry, kids.

02:00.843 --> 02:03.037
We lost the batteries for that.

02:05.591 --> 02:08.864
No problem. A couple just rolled out
from behind your seat.

02:10.191 --> 02:12.046
Bonk it. Twist it.
Smack it. Thwack it.

02:12.214 --> 02:14.048
Whack it. Bonk it. Bop it.

02:28.695 --> 02:30.426
I can't take it anymore!

02:34.347 --> 02:36.085
I can't take it anymore!

02:46.088 --> 02:49.016
Oh, darn.
The batteries are dead.

02:49.141 --> 02:51.760
Not to worry:
it plugs into the cigarette lighter.

02:55.064 --> 02:56.667
Kids, it's daddy's turn.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.594
Stomp it! Crush it! Kill it!

03:04.469 --> 03:07.029
Finally, some peace and quiet.

03:10.397 --> 03:13.065
Why do my actions have consequences?

03:33.683 --> 03:36.873
Now, kids,
we're about to get really cold,

03:37.168 --> 03:40.151
then really warm.

03:49.084 --> 03:51.119
Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.

03:58.403 --> 03:59.636
Drink up, sweetie.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.477
Let the possum work its magic.

04:02.558 --> 04:03.657
Possum?!

04:03.825 --> 04:06.326
Don't worry, we don't kill it.
We just dip it.

04:08.804 --> 04:11.081
- What happened?
- What happened is,

04:11.249 --> 04:12.516
I saved your life.

04:12.641 --> 04:14.656
Now, you's had a rough day.

04:14.781 --> 04:17.113
Why don't you have a pull on this?

04:18.779 --> 04:22.110
- Where's the hooch?
- Excuse my <i>faux pas</i>.

04:22.288 --> 04:24.053
That jug was fo' pa.

04:26.973 --> 04:28.065
Come on, now.

04:28.190 --> 04:30.124
We'll go on back to the still.

04:30.477 --> 04:32.608
And in case we run into trouble...

04:33.830 --> 04:36.217
Brandine! Where is the bazook?

04:38.476 --> 04:40.933
He's gonna shoot
those google earth folks

04:41.058 --> 04:43.858
what caught me
with my breeches down.

04:44.404 --> 04:47.824
This here's my pride and joy:
'ol betsy.

04:48.210 --> 04:51.132
A female that gives
birth to alcohol.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.920
Now, gentlemen, let us toast

04:54.045 --> 04:56.640
our new friend's escape
from death's icy grip

04:56.920 --> 04:59.375
with my latest
batch of whoopee water.

05:02.801 --> 05:04.804
So, what y'all think?

05:05.407 --> 05:07.061
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good.

05:08.823 --> 05:10.708
It angrys up my fists!

05:10.833 --> 05:13.741
I just remembered
my feud with this here tree!

05:13.866 --> 05:16.899
Get her done. Get her done.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.299
What's your take, city boy?

05:22.246 --> 05:26.468
It's got a rich mash base
and a sense of danger.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.163
And I detect notes
of elderberry, tobacco, oak...

05:30.331 --> 05:32.006
No, poison oak...

05:32.131 --> 05:33.941
and hints of game.

05:36.193 --> 05:37.712
That is amazing!

05:37.879 --> 05:40.296
You have the eloquence and urgency

05:40.421 --> 05:43.446
of a census worker caught
in a bear trap.

05:43.571 --> 05:46.162
We's gonna invite you
to all our soirees,

05:46.287 --> 05:47.801
"mixers and drink-'em-ups."

05:49.683 --> 05:52.124
Now let's enjoy
the bluegrass stylings

05:52.249 --> 05:54.353
of the country bear jamboree.

06:06.308 --> 06:08.801
So, you guys have any video games?

06:08.926 --> 06:10.556
Nope, but my mama brought some

06:10.681 --> 06:13.680
of these boom potatoes
back from Iraq.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.334
Set 'em up again.

06:28.681 --> 06:31.857
So, I'll hide, and you guys
count to 100.

06:33.488 --> 06:34.509
- One.
- Two.

06:34.634 --> 06:36.746
- Backwards "e".
- One-legged triangle.

06:36.871 --> 06:39.223
- Banana hot dog.
- Double banana hot dog.

06:39.348 --> 06:40.983
60 corncob two.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.662
This is the best hiding place.

06:45.787 --> 06:47.704
They'll never find me.

06:51.029 --> 06:51.938
I'm here.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.123
Come find me.

06:53.291 --> 06:55.036
Olly olly oxen free.

06:55.161 --> 06:57.255
Olly olly oxen free!

07:00.531 --> 07:03.049
Why did I do poetry club
instead of girl scouts?

07:03.174 --> 07:06.050
Why did I do poetry club instead
of girl scouts?

07:06.175 --> 07:08.672
Dark is she, but brilliant.

07:08.973 --> 07:10.565
Black are her wings...

07:10.690 --> 07:12.134
black on black.

07:13.749 --> 07:15.330
She is Lilith,

07:15.646 --> 07:19.149
Who leadeth forth the hordes
of the abyss.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.537
You are going to be so embarrassed.

07:30.662 --> 07:34.142
There are two other people
at this party dressed just like you.

07:38.073 --> 07:39.416
State thy business.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.138
My name's Lisa, and I was playing
hide-and-seek when I met you ladies.

07:43.577 --> 07:45.918
- Please don't hurt me.
- We're not going to hurt you.

07:46.043 --> 07:48.435
But we don't like outsiders
observing our esbat.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.094
What's an Esbat?

07:50.219 --> 07:53.072
An ancient ritual
in celebration of the full moon.

07:53.197 --> 07:55.640
- We're wiccans.
- You mean witches?

07:55.808 --> 07:56.770
Technically...

07:56.895 --> 07:58.528
but we're not into broomsticks

07:58.653 --> 08:00.204
or pointy hats.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.548
Well, I'm glad you're not witches.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.734
Wouldn't want you
to cast a spell on me.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.446
Oh, we cast spells.

08:07.674 --> 08:08.936
And they work.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.815
Sure, they do.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.280
If magic was real,
I'd use it to get out

08:13.405 --> 08:16.036
of my pipe cleaner art project
that's due tomorrow.

08:17.241 --> 08:19.697
You should keep an open mind.

08:19.822 --> 08:23.069
Things said in the circle have
a surprising way of coming true.

08:23.194 --> 08:24.003
Lisa.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.816
Lisa!

08:26.080 --> 08:27.526
Dad, over here!

08:28.090 --> 08:29.594
Come, sisters of the elements.

08:29.719 --> 08:32.408
Let us leave this place
in a manner most wiccan.

08:32.533 --> 08:35.245
- What are you talking about?
- Text your mom to pick us up.

08:37.841 --> 08:39.788
Oh, sweetie, I found you.

08:40.101 --> 08:41.652
Now, who's going to find us?

08:41.777 --> 08:43.554
Help!

08:54.617 --> 08:57.968
I have one minute to avoid
my first late assignment ever.

08:59.069 --> 09:02.497
The pipe cleaner fur
is coming off on my hands.

09:05.886 --> 09:09.005
Class, miss hoover
will not be in today,

09:09.173 --> 09:12.670
so you all get a's
on your pipe cleaner sculptures.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.390
What happened to miss Hoover?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.767
Came down with a spell
of stomach flu.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.479
Spell? Those girls couldn't have made
her sick... or could they?

09:24.647 --> 09:27.656
Maybe we'll pass the time
with another craft project.

09:27.781 --> 09:29.442
I'll let one of you pick.

09:30.409 --> 09:32.128
Lisa.
Which craft?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.753
Which craft?

09:36.492 --> 09:38.608
Which craft?!

09:41.473 --> 09:42.984
This here country is home

09:43.109 --> 09:45.709
to over 300 family-owned stills.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.356
None of them big
corporate moonshiners,

09:48.481 --> 09:50.492
like crazy-think white lightning

09:50.617 --> 09:53.643
or Dwayne Saggery's demento juice.

09:53.768 --> 09:56.778
So, let's go taste some
independent hooch!

10:24.726 --> 10:26.652
Thanks for bringing us down here.

10:26.777 --> 10:30.231
Yeah. There's something wonderful
about being drunk outdoors.

10:30.356 --> 10:33.506
- I wonder if Moe misses us.
- No, I don't miss you.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.043
Now, get back to my bar
for happy hour,

10:36.168 --> 10:39.109
or I'll paint the snow pink
with your brains.

10:42.486 --> 10:45.348
Drop your fire sticks, man possum.

10:45.473 --> 10:49.564
So I guess this means you hillbillies
are going to have your way with me?

10:49.732 --> 10:50.866
For god's sake.

10:50.991 --> 10:53.114
You know, one hillbilly has his way

10:53.239 --> 10:54.980
with one fat guy in deliverance,

10:55.105 --> 10:58.095
and suddenly, people think
that's all hillbillies do.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.836
I suppose you think all space
is Star Wars.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.169
No, I thought we had
a connection here,

11:04.294 --> 11:06.230
and we're out in the woods and...

11:06.355 --> 11:09.162
Hey, forget it!
I... I ain't gonna beg for it.

11:10.031 --> 11:12.087
You'll never know
what you missed out on.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.917
Did you girls make miss Hoover sick?

11:22.082 --> 11:26.061
Oh, no, we would never ask
the goddess to harm a teacher.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.249
But if the goddess chose to help you

11:28.374 --> 11:31.718
by giving miss Hoover
the hershey squirts,

11:31.843 --> 11:33.483
such is her divine Wisdom.

11:34.362 --> 11:37.436
Listen, not that
I've lost my skepticism,

11:37.561 --> 11:39.957
but I am interested
in learning more about wiccans.

11:40.082 --> 11:42.903
Are you a minority group
as defined by Ivy league admissions?

11:43.028 --> 11:45.470
- Cornell and Dartmouth.
- What else ya got?

11:45.595 --> 11:46.913
We worship nature.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.540
I worship nature!

11:48.708 --> 11:49.875
Want to join us?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.544
Well, it is an honor to be asked.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.580
But I never make a final decision
in the middle of a forest at night.

11:55.705 --> 11:58.785
- That's smart thinkin'!
- Shut up and dig your own grave.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.937
What if I don't dig it?
What are you gonna do then?

12:01.062 --> 12:03.005
Guess I'll have to dig it for ya.

12:03.130 --> 12:05.659
With your bad back?
Forget about it!

12:15.966 --> 12:17.646
Is that a pentagram?

12:18.455 --> 12:21.118
Lis! You've finally come
over to the dark side!

12:21.243 --> 12:23.074
Um, it's the wiccan home page.

12:23.979 --> 12:26.287
I'm thinking of joining.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.630
No, no, no.

12:27.755 --> 12:29.662
You're too young to be a witch.

12:29.787 --> 12:32.577
Savor the steps leading up to it.

12:32.702 --> 12:35.211
College anorexic,
string of bad marriages,

12:35.379 --> 12:38.006
career disappointments,
failed pottery shop.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.968
And then when you're old and alone,
you can hit the witch thing hard.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.402
Hey, every witch needs a familiar.

12:49.527 --> 12:52.925
I'm gonna put a spell on you!
Yes, I am,

12:53.050 --> 12:54.773
My tuna-breath familiar.

12:55.754 --> 12:56.858
Zap! Zap! Zap!

12:58.288 --> 13:00.292
I curse you, hell's kitten!

13:00.488 --> 13:01.892
Just as I feared.

13:02.017 --> 13:04.649
Her buddhism has led
directly to witchcraft.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.849
And she's teleconferencing the devil

13:09.974 --> 13:11.534
using that computer from hell!

13:11.659 --> 13:13.410
I think it says "Dell."

13:13.535 --> 13:15.502
We'll let the authorities
sort that out.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.314
Mmm, not bad.

13:30.872 --> 13:32.628
What's that twirly ruckus?

13:33.190 --> 13:34.561
The government!

13:45.562 --> 13:48.743
Initiate, how does one
enter the circle?

13:48.911 --> 13:51.746
With perfect faith and perfect love.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.582
Join us, join us.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.966
- GRAPE
- Join us.

13:58.956 --> 14:01.331
Do not sanctify that witch!

14:04.875 --> 14:08.012
I kinda feel sorry for them,
crammed in that back seat.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.263
Toss them a Judy Blume novel, Lou.

14:10.587 --> 14:12.365
<i>Uh, all we've got is Wifey, chief.</i>

14:12.490 --> 14:13.854
Nothing with kids in it?

14:14.590 --> 14:16.198
Damn budget cuts.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.776
Burn!

14:21.695 --> 14:24.347
Double bubble boil and trouble?

14:24.472 --> 14:28.048
Today, Springfield will see
its first witch trials in 12 years.

14:28.173 --> 14:30.471
Oh, I think I see the witches now.

14:30.596 --> 14:33.903
This reporter has never encountered
such disfigured crones.

14:34.032 --> 14:35.627
We're not the witches!

14:35.752 --> 14:38.738
Oh, well then you must be victims
of the witches' hideous curse.

14:38.863 --> 14:41.864
You didn't think I was so
hideous that night we made out

14:41.989 --> 14:43.989
in the back booth
at the seafood hut.

14:44.114 --> 14:46.193
We all did crazy things on 9/11.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.696
Ah, here come the witches.

14:47.821 --> 14:50.160
Do you have a statement
for us mortals?

14:50.328 --> 14:53.270
Goddess lilith, who knows
our hearts are pure...

14:53.395 --> 14:55.002
Oh, Queen of magic,

14:55.127 --> 14:58.118
show our persecutors
that they are blind.

14:58.243 --> 15:00.170
They are blind!

15:02.239 --> 15:04.049
I'm blind! I'm blind!

15:04.466 --> 15:06.405
What goes around, comes around.

15:11.139 --> 15:13.163
Dear, god, I've gone blind.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.438
Nurse, you'll have to be my eyes.

15:15.804 --> 15:17.279
I'm blind, too!

15:17.404 --> 15:19.731
Then I guess it's up to me.

15:26.986 --> 15:28.740
Gwendolyn nightshadow,

15:28.908 --> 15:31.632
did you use your supernatural powers

15:31.757 --> 15:33.766
to blind half this town?

15:33.934 --> 15:35.192
We're just kids.

15:35.317 --> 15:37.608
My real name isn't even
Gwendolyn Nightshadow.

15:37.733 --> 15:40.168
It's Stacey, Stacey Deathsatan.

15:43.841 --> 15:44.714
So...

15:44.882 --> 15:46.697
the defendants recruited you,

15:46.822 --> 15:50.053
a young innocent,
into their evil coven.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.515
They're not evil! They believe in
friendship and respecting the earth.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.757
And they made me feel
like I belonged.

15:55.882 --> 15:58.290
Your honor, I'd like to enter
something into the record.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.405
- Strangely, I'll allow it.
- Everybody,

16:00.530 --> 16:02.415
I am a big dummy with a stupid job.

16:02.540 --> 16:06.003
I write down what other people say,
just like a big dummy would.

16:06.128 --> 16:08.036
Could the court reporter
read that back?

16:08.161 --> 16:11.094
"I am a big dummy
with a stupid job"?!

16:15.121 --> 16:16.704
In all my years of being a judge,

16:16.829 --> 16:18.706
I've never seen such a flimsy case.

16:18.874 --> 16:21.945
Are you sure? 'cause we've
brought you a lot of flimsy cases.

16:22.070 --> 16:24.655
Like that goat we accused
of income tax evasion.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.214
I still think he was guilty.

16:28.902 --> 16:30.738
I'm not wasting
another minute on this.

16:30.863 --> 16:31.886
Case dismissed!

16:34.216 --> 16:35.585
There's no justice here.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.296
They made me blind!

16:37.421 --> 16:39.573
And now I can really
hear how I bomb!

16:39.698 --> 16:41.938
Well, I say we take them out
and have our own trial!

16:45.952 --> 16:47.193
Don't mind me.

16:47.318 --> 16:49.507
I'm just trying to get
a fly on the ceiling.

16:52.543 --> 16:54.055
I got you now.

16:56.162 --> 16:58.906
Burn the witch!

17:00.629 --> 17:01.833
Not so fast!

17:02.001 --> 17:05.086
As citizens, we are still
bound by the rule of law.

17:06.422 --> 17:08.140
17th-century law!

17:09.457 --> 17:12.352
I have reconstructed
the ultimate instrument

17:12.477 --> 17:14.095
of colonial justice:

17:14.262 --> 17:15.722
The dunking stool.

17:15.847 --> 17:18.183
If the alleged witches
survive the dunking,

17:18.351 --> 17:20.143
They clearly were witches!

17:20.268 --> 17:23.674
If they drown, then they
were clearly innocent.

17:23.925 --> 17:27.477
After this, it will be featured
in the fifth-grade play, the crucible.

17:27.602 --> 17:29.124
Good seats still available.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.422
By which I mean, seats in the
back where you can fall asleep.

17:39.747 --> 17:41.602
Don't dip those wiccans!

17:42.708 --> 17:45.096
They didn't blind anyone.
I have proof!

17:45.628 --> 17:48.008
- Proof?
- When my father was attending

17:48.133 --> 17:50.089
the moonshine competition
last Saturday...

17:50.257 --> 17:52.697
You said you were
at a parenting class!

17:52.822 --> 17:55.799
Marge, please. You're embarrassing
me in front of the mob.

17:55.924 --> 17:59.208
You heard sirens, which you thought
were police coming to arrest you.

17:59.437 --> 18:00.975
To ditch their stills,

18:01.143 --> 18:03.443
<i>the moonshiners
pushed them down a hill.</i>

18:03.568 --> 18:05.310
<i>The moonshine landed in a river,</i>

18:05.435 --> 18:09.122
<i>temporarily blinding anyone
or anything that drank it.</i>

18:17.243 --> 18:19.233
<i>That river led to the reservoir</i>

18:19.358 --> 18:21.822
<i>which made anyone who drank
the town's tap water</i>

18:21.947 --> 18:23.998
<i>also go temporarily blind.</i>

18:25.084 --> 18:27.244
Moonshine in the water?

18:27.369 --> 18:29.212
I'll be the judge of that.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.897
Hillbilly moonshine!

18:38.022 --> 18:39.597
The little witch is right!

18:45.646 --> 18:48.104
Wait, wait, wait, don't unform!
You're a great mob!

18:48.229 --> 18:50.365
We'll think of something else
to get upset about!

18:50.490 --> 18:52.979
How about all that construction
on route one, huh?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.254
Oh, you ain't no mob.

18:57.379 --> 18:59.492
You're just a bunch
of spineless weasels.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.412
Hey, t's just a figure of speech.

19:02.580 --> 19:03.955
Kill the weasel hater!

19:05.716 --> 19:07.579
Now this is what I'm talking about!

19:08.335 --> 19:10.938
Sister Lisa, thank you
for saving us.

19:11.063 --> 19:13.580
- You were awesome.
- No, thank you.

19:13.705 --> 19:16.415
I've been rational
but nerdy my whole life.

19:16.540 --> 19:19.922
But these past few weeks,
you girls made me feel cool.

19:20.306 --> 19:21.290
Cool!

19:21.415 --> 19:23.807
Me, Lisa Simpson!

19:24.178 --> 19:27.723
Well, I think you're
very interesting girls,

19:27.848 --> 19:29.147
but from now on,

19:29.315 --> 19:31.264
The only "witch" in lisa's life

19:31.389 --> 19:33.613
is which boy will marry her.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.453
Right, Homer? Homer?

19:35.863 --> 19:37.155
Start the ride!

19:42.688 --> 19:43.700
Again!
