00:31.464 --> 00:35.025
Somewhere in the vaults
of a bank in London...

00:35.068 --> 00:38.765
is a tin dispatch box
with my name on it.

00:38.805 --> 00:43.868
lt is not to be opened
until 50 years after my death.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.435
lt contains certain mementos...

00:46.479 --> 00:48.572
of my long association
with a man...

00:48.615 --> 00:52.642
who elevated the science
of deduction to an art--

00:52.685 --> 00:55.586
the world's first,
and, undeniably...

00:55.622 --> 00:59.922
most famous consulting
detective.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.601
To my heirs--

03:22.635 --> 03:24.262
ln my lifetime...

03:24.304 --> 03:26.397
l have recorded
some sixty cases...

03:26.439 --> 03:29.169
demonstrating the singular gift
of my friend...

03:29.209 --> 03:30.733
Sherlock Holmes...

03:30.777 --> 03:32.039
dealing with everything...

03:32.078 --> 03:34.512
from ''The Hound
of the Baskervilles''...

03:34.547 --> 03:36.310
to his mysterious
brother Mycroft...

03:36.349 --> 03:39.785
and the devilish
Professor Moriarty.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.719
But there were
other adventures which...

03:41.754 --> 03:43.688
for reasons of discretion...

03:43.723 --> 03:45.987
l have decided to withhold
from the public...

03:46.025 --> 03:48.289
until this much later date.

03:48.328 --> 03:52.230
They involve matters of
a delicate and, sometimes...

03:52.265 --> 03:53.994
scandalous nature...

03:54.033 --> 03:55.864
as will shortly
become apparent.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.773
lt was August of 1887...

04:01.808 --> 04:04.072
and we were returning
from Yorkshire...

04:04.110 --> 04:06.874
where Holmes had solved
the baffling murder...

04:06.913 --> 04:09.473
of Admiral Abernetti.

04:09.515 --> 04:12.609
You may recall that he broke
the murderer's alibi...

04:12.652 --> 04:15.018
by measuring the depth
to which the parsley...

04:15.054 --> 04:18.956
had sunk in the butter
on a hot day.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.435
l wish you'd give me
a bit more warning...

04:40.480 --> 04:42.380
when you come home unexpected.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.714
l'd have roasted a goose,
had a few flowers for you.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.117
My dear Mrs. Hudson...

04:47.153 --> 04:50.054
criminals are as
unpredictable as head colds.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.989
You never quite know when
you're going to catch one.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.890
l'll unpack your bags.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.520
Here's an advance copy
of ''Strand Magazine.''

04:56.562 --> 04:58.826
They've printed
''The Red-headed League.''

04:58.865 --> 05:00.162
Very impressive.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.632
Would you like to see
how l've treated it?

05:01.668 --> 05:03.727
l can hardly wait.
l'm sure l shall find out...

05:03.770 --> 05:05.567
all sorts
of fascinating things...

05:05.605 --> 05:07.232
about the case
that l never knew before.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.104
Just what do you mean by that?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.234
Oh, come now, Watson.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.904
You must admit you have
a tendency to overromanticize.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.914
You've taken my simple
exercises in logic...

05:15.948 --> 05:18.075
and embellished them,
embroidered them...

05:18.117 --> 05:19.084
exaggerated them.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.415
l deny the accusation.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.943
You've described me as 6'4''...

05:21.988 --> 05:24.582
whereas l am barely 6'1''.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.989
A bit of poetic license.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.925
You've saddled me with
this improbable costume...

05:27.960 --> 05:29.552
which the public
now expects me to wear.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.586
That is not my doing.
Blame it on the illustrator.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.259
Made me out to be
a violin virtuoso.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.289
There's an invitation...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.326
from the Liverpool Symphony
to appear as soloist...

05:37.370 --> 05:38.803
in ''The Mendelssohn Concerto.''

05:38.838 --> 05:39.805
Really?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.431
The fact is, l could
barely hold my own...

05:41.474 --> 05:43.999
in the pit orchestra
of a second-rate music hall.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.170
You're much too modest.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.146
You have given the reader
the distinct impression...

05:48.181 --> 05:50.706
that l'm a misogynist.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.809
Actually,
l don't dislike women.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.184
l merely distrust them.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.088
The twinkle in the eye
and the arsenic in the soup.

05:58.124 --> 06:01.389
lt's those little touches
that make you colorful.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.361
Lurid is more like it.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.830
You've painted me
as a hopeless dope addict...

06:05.865 --> 06:09.301
just because l occasionally
take a 5%% solution of cocaine.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.632
A seven percent solution.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.570
Five percent.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.300
Don't you think l'm aware
you've been diluting it...

06:14.340 --> 06:16.501
behind my back?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.136
As a doctor,
as well as your friend...

06:19.178 --> 06:20.577
l strongly disapprove...

06:20.613 --> 06:23.446
of this insidious habit
of yours.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.145
My dear friend,
as well as my dear doctor...

06:26.185 --> 06:27.812
l only resort to narcotics...

06:27.854 --> 06:30.379
when l'm suffering
from acute boredom...

06:30.423 --> 06:31.515
when there are
no interesting cases...

06:31.557 --> 06:32.854
to engage my mind.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.154
Look at this.

06:34.193 --> 06:36.821
An urgent appeal to find
some missing midgets.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.330
Did you say midgets?

06:38.364 --> 06:41.060
Mmm, six of them.
The Tumbling Piccolos...

06:41.100 --> 06:43.125
an acrobatic act
with some circus.

06:43.169 --> 06:46.297
Disappeared between
London and Bristol.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.931
Well, don't you
find that intriguing?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.635
Extremely so.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.472
You see, they're
not only midgets...

06:51.511 --> 06:53.138
but also anarchists.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.203
Anarchists?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.078
By now they have been
smuggled to Vienna...

06:56.115 --> 06:58.948
dressed as little girls
in organdy pinafores.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.010
They are to greet
the czar of all the Russias...

07:01.053 --> 07:02.987
when he arrives
at the railway station.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.354
They will be carrying
bouquets of flowers...

07:05.391 --> 07:07.222
and concealed
in each bouquet...

07:07.260 --> 07:09.353
will be a bomb
with a lit fuse.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.961
You really think so?

07:11.998 --> 07:13.522
Not at all.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.899
The circus owner offers me
five pounds for my services.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.597
That's not even
a pound a midget.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.299
So, obviously,
he's a stingy blighter...

07:20.339 --> 07:21.397
and the little chaps
simply ran off...

07:21.441 --> 07:22.703
to join another circus.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.700
lt sounded so promising.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.442
There are no great crimes
anymore, Watson.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.541
The criminal class
has lost all enterprise...

07:31.584 --> 07:32.744
and originality.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.515
At best, they commit
some bungling villainy...

07:35.555 --> 07:37.250
with a motive so transparent...

07:37.290 --> 07:39.918
that even a Scotland Yard
official could see through it.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.986
Mrs. Hudson!

07:46.199 --> 07:47.962
Yes? What is it?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.797
What have l done now?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.997
There is something missing
from my desk.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.005
Missing?

07:53.039 --> 07:54.006
Something very crucial.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.007
What?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.167
Dust!

07:56.209 --> 07:59.440
You've been tidying up
against my explicit orders.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.607
Oh, look, l made sure
l hadn't disturbed anything.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.946
Dust, Mrs. Hudson,
is an essential part...

08:04.984 --> 08:06.451
of my filing system.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.544
By the thickness of it...

08:07.587 --> 08:09.077
l can date any document
immediately.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.988
Well, some of the dust
was this thick.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.892
That would be...

08:14.927 --> 08:16.656
March 1883.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.986
Oh! How can you stand this?

08:44.023 --> 08:46.821
Why don't you let me
air the room out?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.986
Please, Mrs. Hudson,
he's working on...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.019
a definitive study
of tobacco ash.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.725
Oh, l'm sure there's
a crying need for that.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.234
ln our endeavors,
it is sometimes vital...

08:56.269 --> 08:58.362
to distinguish
between, say, the ashes...

08:58.404 --> 09:01.635
of a Macedonian cigarette
and a Jamaican cigar.

09:01.674 --> 09:05.633
So far he has classified
140 different kinds of ashes.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.772
All of which will
wind up on my rug.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.180
That will be enough,
Mrs. Hudson.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.114
All right...

09:14.153 --> 09:17.281
if you gentlemen want
to stay and suffocate.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.657
She's right. l am suffocating.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.667
Oh, let me open the window.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.932
Not from lack of air.
From lack of activity.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.439
Sitting here, week after week,
blowing smoke rings...

09:34.473 --> 09:37.704
staring through a microscope--
there's no challenge in that.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.075
Personally, l consider it
a major contribution...

09:40.112 --> 09:42.046
to scientific criminology.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.379
How l envy you
your mind, Watson.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.384
You do?

09:45.418 --> 09:48.910
lt's placid,
imperturbable, prosaic.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.856
But my mind rebels
against stagnation.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.451
lt's like a racing engine
tearing itself to pieces...

09:54.493 --> 09:56.051
because it's not connected up...

09:56.095 --> 09:57.619
with the work
for which it was built.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.442
Holmes.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.221
Holmes...where's
your self-control?

11:04.263 --> 11:05.423
Fair question.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.425
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

11:09.468 --> 11:11.595
Thoroughly...

11:11.637 --> 11:13.127
but this will
take care of it.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.679
There was nothing l could do...

11:29.722 --> 11:31.747
when he went on one of
his cocaine binges...

11:31.791 --> 11:34.726
except hope and pray that
some interesting case...

11:34.760 --> 11:36.819
would come along
to snap him out of it.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.557
Why are you being
so stubborn, Holmes?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.033
Why won't you go?

11:44.170 --> 11:49.164
lt's the final performance of
the lmperial Russian Ballet.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.005
The house has been
sold out for months.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.637
Tickets are going
at a guinea apiece.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.670
That's precisely it.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.149
Why should someone
send us two free tickets?

11:58.184 --> 11:59.310
Anonymously, at that.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.148
Well, whoever sent them
must be in great distress.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.484
The note says...

12:02.521 --> 12:06.252
''Please, you are the only man
in the world who can help me.''

12:06.292 --> 12:08.385
l suspect
it's some sort of plot.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.327
You mean, somebody wants
to lure us into a trap?

12:10.362 --> 12:11.852
Somebody wants to kill me.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.886
Kill you?

12:12.932 --> 12:13.990
That's right.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.159
lt's a plot
to bore me to death.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.532
l detest ballet.

12:17.536 --> 12:21.199
But this isn't just
any ballet.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.140
lt's ''Swan Lake.''

12:43.896 --> 12:45.955
You know, of course, Holmes...

12:45.998 --> 12:48.330
that swan isn't really a swan.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.097
lt's an enchanted princess.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.331
Mmm.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.067
Fabulous woman.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.571
Don't you think so, Holmes?

13:26.605 --> 13:27.572
Who?

13:27.606 --> 13:29.096
The great Petrova.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.286
Very strong arches,
l must admit.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.988
They say twelve men
have died for her.

13:49.028 --> 13:49.995
Really?

13:50.029 --> 13:51.894
Six committed suicide...

13:51.931 --> 13:53.398
four were killed in duels...

13:53.432 --> 13:54.831
and one fell out
of the gallery...

13:54.867 --> 13:56.960
of the Vienna Opera House.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.492
That's only eleven.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.767
The man who fell
from the gallery...

14:00.806 --> 14:03.832
landed on top of another man
in the orchestra.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.310
That makes an even dozen...

14:06.345 --> 14:08.313
in a messy sort of way.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.159
Mr. Holmes.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.599
Yes?

14:29.635 --> 14:31.432
l am Nikolai Rogozhin...

14:31.470 --> 14:34.268
Director General of
the lmperial Russian Ballet.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.607
So glad you accept invitation.

14:39.645 --> 14:40.737
This is Dr. Watson.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.440
Nice to meet you.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.618
You're enjoying?

14:46.652 --> 14:47.880
lmmensely.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.617
Tell me, Mr. Holmes...

14:53.659 --> 14:55.456
how is your health?

14:55.494 --> 14:56.791
My health?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.490
Better consult my doctor.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.191
Oh, he's in excellent shape.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.896
Any insanity in your family?
Diabetes? Asthma?

15:05.938 --> 15:08.406
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

15:08.440 --> 15:09.839
Certainly.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.202
Madame Petrova...

15:14.213 --> 15:16.306
she has problem.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.009
Can you be more specific?

15:18.050 --> 15:20.245
Certainly not.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.254
Liaison with a crowned head?

15:22.288 --> 15:24.483
Compromising letters? Blackmail?

15:36.135 --> 15:37.193
After performance...

15:37.236 --> 15:40.399
there will be little
celebration backstage...

15:40.439 --> 15:42.430
and Madame requests
your presence.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.271
We'd be delighted.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.437
You are invited, also.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.516
Hey!

16:14.306 --> 16:17.332
Ah, Mr. Holmes...

16:17.376 --> 16:19.310
Madame is expecting you
in her dressing room.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.646
Dr. Watson, you will
amuse yourself meanwhile.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.048
We have vodka, caviar, girls.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.109
Oh, no, thank you.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.141
No girls?

16:28.187 --> 16:30.678
No caviar.
lt makes me break out in hives.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.029
...Doctor Watson.

16:43.102 --> 16:46.037
Any of your girls
understand English?

16:46.071 --> 16:48.039
Nyet!

16:48.073 --> 16:49.267
Well, now, not one single word?

16:49.308 --> 16:50.673
Nyet!

16:51.510 --> 16:53.774
ln that case,
l don't mind telling you...

16:53.812 --> 16:57.248
that you all have
lovely pooh-poohs.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.954
Mr. Holmes,
l must prepare you.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.184
This is not ordinary case.

17:06.224 --> 17:09.455
lt's only the extraordinary
that interests me.

17:09.494 --> 17:10.587
Good.

17:10.628 --> 17:15.656
Because you'll find this
extra-extraordinary.

17:19.104 --> 17:20.502
Madame Petrova...

17:26.779 --> 17:28.804
...Mr. Sherlock Holmes...

17:28.847 --> 17:32.647
may l present Madame Petrova.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.589
Ochen priatna.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.730
Madame.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.837
Madame says you are
shorter than she thought.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.170
Oh, l didn't mean to be.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.710
Short, tall, who cares?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.477
lt is the brains that count.

18:04.516 --> 18:05.847
Well, thank you.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.078
Thank you.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.452
...Baskervilles.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.585
Madame is great
admirer of yours.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.288
She has read every story.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.320
Her favorite is...

18:19.364 --> 18:22.458
''Big Dog from Baskervilles.''

18:22.501 --> 18:25.163
l'm afraid it loses
something in translation.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.296
Nikolai...

18:29.341 --> 18:32.367
Mr. Holmes,
you know about fiddles?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.576
What is your opinion of this?

18:43.622 --> 18:48.889
''Antonius Stradivarius,
Cremonensis...

18:48.927 --> 18:51.361
''Anno 1709.''

18:52.364 --> 18:54.195
Well, the label is authentic.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.470
Judging from the shape,
the color of the varnish...

19:00.506 --> 19:03.202
and the tone, l would say
it is a genuine Stradivarius...

19:03.242 --> 19:04.402
of the best period.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.105
You like?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.408
Oh, it's magnificent.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.436
Nikolai...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.481
Here. Take it.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.921
Madame says it is yours.

19:18.957 --> 19:19.924
Mine?

19:19.958 --> 19:22.483
For services you will render.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.258
My fees as a detective
are not exactly trifling...

19:25.297 --> 19:27.390
but a Stradivarius--
you're not serious.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.492
l am not, but Madame is.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.271
All right...

19:42.314 --> 19:44.305
l will pour vodka
and explain.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.177
Mr. Holmes...

19:48.220 --> 19:51.656
what you have seen
tonight is last...

19:51.690 --> 19:53.681
and positively
final performance...

19:53.725 --> 19:55.556
of Madame Petrova.

19:55.594 --> 19:56.561
She is retiring.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.256
What a shame.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.094
She's been dancing since
she was three years old...

20:00.132 --> 20:02.464
and after all,
she is now thirty-eight.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.594
l must say,
she doesn't look thirty-eight.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.037
That is because
she is forty-nine.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.599
So Madame has decided
to leave ballet...

20:11.643 --> 20:13.634
and spend life
bringing up her child.

20:13.679 --> 20:14.873
How admirable.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.881
Problem is how to find father.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.212
Oh, is he missing?

20:18.250 --> 20:19.217
Correct.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.582
And that's why
you've called me in.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.052
Also correct.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.054
We must have father.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.955
Because without father,
how could there be child?

20:25.991 --> 20:27.288
Oh, l see.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.319
The whole thing is still
in the planning stage.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.330
Correct again.

20:32.364 --> 20:33.729
Madame would like child...

20:33.765 --> 20:36.290
to be brilliant
and beautiful.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.429
Since she is beautiful,
she needs man who is brilliant.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.405
Zo sdarovya!

20:48.447 --> 20:49.641
What's in it?

20:49.681 --> 20:50.648
What does it taste like?

20:50.682 --> 20:51.671
Red pepper.

20:51.717 --> 20:52.877
That's what's in it.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.512
l beg your pardon?

20:56.555 --> 20:58.420
Madame would like to know
when you can be ready.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.084
-Ready?
-To leave for Venice.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.422
All the arrangements
have been made.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.360
You will spend
one week there with Madame--

21:03.395 --> 21:04.362
This is all
very flattering...

21:04.396 --> 21:05.886
but surely
there are other men...

21:05.931 --> 21:06.898
better men.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.899
To tell truth...

21:07.933 --> 21:09.560
you were not
the first choice.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.933
We considered
Russian writer...Tolstoy.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.995
Oh, that's more like it.
The man's a genius.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.165
Too old.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.040
Then we considered
philosopher...Nietzsche.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.543
Well, absolutely
first-rate mind.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.840
Uh-uh, too German.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.279
Then we considered
Tchaikovsky.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.283
Oh, you couldn't go
wrong with Tchaikovsky.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.945
We could, and we did.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.546
lt was catastrophe.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.556
Why?

21:31.590 --> 21:33.558
We don't know.

21:33.592 --> 21:36.561
Because Tchaikovsky--

21:36.595 --> 21:37.755
how shall l put it?

21:39.865 --> 21:43.130
Women...not his glass of tea.

21:44.403 --> 21:45.870
Oh, pity, that.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.570
Madame is very happy
with her final choice.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.341
Madame must not be too hasty.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.314
She must remember
that l am an Englishman.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.316
So?

21:58.350 --> 21:59.317
You know what
they say about us.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.613
lf there's one thing
more deplorable...

22:00.652 --> 22:02.586
than our cooking,
it's our lovemaking.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.215
We are not the most
romantic of people.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.224
Perfect.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.192
We don't want
sentimental idiots...

22:08.226 --> 22:11.957
falling in love,
committing suicide.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.794
One week in Venice
with Madame...

22:13.832 --> 22:15.857
she goes back to
St. Petersburg with baby...

22:15.901 --> 22:18.961
you go back to London
with fiddle.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.934
An equitable arrangement.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.572
About my medical history...

22:25.610 --> 22:27.237
when you asked me,
l neglected to mention...

22:27.279 --> 22:28.906
one small detail.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.938
There is hemophilia
in my family.

22:30.982 --> 22:31.949
Huh?

22:31.983 --> 22:34.008
We're all bleeders.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.224
Madame says not to worry,
she will not scratch you.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.163
Well, that's reassuring
to know, but there--

22:50.635 --> 22:52.432
Madame says you talk too much.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.838
You find her attractive
or no?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.842
Well, l...

22:57.876 --> 22:58.843
Oh, excuse me.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.471
What does ''prokyzhynik''
mean?

23:01.513 --> 23:04.448
lt means you little devil.

23:04.483 --> 23:07.247
lt does? l am? Thank you.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.547
l repeat question.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.949
You find Madame
attractive or no?

23:14.960 --> 23:17.895
Oh, l find her
most attractive...

23:18.964 --> 23:20.591
for a woman, that is.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.099
Then no problem.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.261
Maybe a slight one.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.202
You see, l am not a free man.

23:27.005 --> 23:28.597
Not free?

23:28.640 --> 23:29.868
But you are bachelor.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.139
A bachelor living
with another bachelor...

23:33.178 --> 23:35.078
for the last five years.

23:36.882 --> 23:39.316
Five very happy years.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.414
What is it you are
trying to tell us?

23:44.456 --> 23:46.515
Well, l hoped l could
avoid the subject...

23:46.558 --> 23:50.187
but some of us,
through a cruel...

23:50.228 --> 23:51.593
caprice of Mother Nature--

23:51.630 --> 23:53.222
Get to point.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.096
The point is
that Tchaikovsky...

23:55.133 --> 23:57.294
is not an isolated case.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.065
You mean you
and Dr. Watson...

24:02.207 --> 24:05.973
He...is your glass of tea?

24:06.011 --> 24:08.070
lf you want to be
picturesque about it.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.714
...Tchaikovsky?

24:34.673 --> 24:37.699
Believe me, Madame,
the loss is all mine.

24:38.543 --> 24:40.534
But l would rather
disappoint you now...

24:40.579 --> 24:43.139
than disappoint you
in a gondola in Venice.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.942
lt would have been...
catastrophe!

25:08.607 --> 25:09.574
Watson.

25:09.608 --> 25:10.575
Watson, are you coming?

25:10.609 --> 25:11.576
What is it, old boy?

25:11.610 --> 25:12.577
We're going home.

25:12.611 --> 25:16.206
Home? Not a chance.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.217
Not the slightest,
not the remotest chance.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.411
Toodle-oo!

25:30.695 --> 25:31.957
Hey!

27:42.293 --> 27:43.521
Good luck.

27:45.630 --> 27:47.825
Just one moment.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.765
What's going on?

27:57.308 --> 27:58.832
What happened to the girls?

27:58.877 --> 28:01.243
Why, do you not
prefer it this way?

28:01.279 --> 28:02.405
What way?

28:02.447 --> 28:04.415
Oh, you don't
have to pretend.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.679
Mr. Holmes
told us everything...

28:06.718 --> 28:08.345
about you and him.

28:08.386 --> 28:10.479
About me and him?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.786
Come on.
No need to be bashful.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.951
We are not bourgeois.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.860
Maybe between doctors
and detectives...

28:17.896 --> 28:19.864
is unusual, but...

28:19.898 --> 28:22.867
in ballet, is very usual.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.926
What is?

28:24.969 --> 28:28.735
Caprice of Mother Nature.

28:28.773 --> 28:32.265
Look, Cahvel and Misha...

28:32.310 --> 28:37.475
Boris and Demitri,
and llya and Sergei.

28:37.515 --> 28:41.042
Sergei...half and half.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.749
Holmes!

29:26.264 --> 29:27.595
Holmes!

29:31.603 --> 29:33.230
There you are.

29:33.271 --> 29:37.435
You wretch! You rotter!

29:37.475 --> 29:39.033
You blackguard!

29:39.077 --> 29:42.569
Of all the vile,
unspeakable fabrications!

29:42.614 --> 29:46.015
What do you have to say
for yourself?

29:46.050 --> 29:48.348
Well, don't just sit there!

29:48.386 --> 29:49.546
Speak up, man!

29:58.096 --> 29:59.688
Holmes?

30:03.635 --> 30:04.932
Are you all right, Holmes?

30:06.905 --> 30:08.133
Holmes?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.254
From the sound
of your footsteps...

30:24.289 --> 30:27.554
l gathered that you were not
in a particularly amiable mood.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.994
How--how could you...

30:33.031 --> 30:35.795
invent such a dastardly lie?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.200
What the deuce
were you thinking of?

30:42.407 --> 30:46.468
Watson, you have
my most abject apologies.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.071
But have you ever been
cornered by a madwoman?

30:49.113 --> 30:50.978
lt seemed like the only
way to get out of it...

30:51.015 --> 30:53.176
without hurting her feelings.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.981
And what about my feelings...

30:55.019 --> 30:56.646
and my reputation?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.156
You realize the gravity
of what you've done...

30:59.190 --> 31:00.384
the possible repercussions?

31:00.425 --> 31:01.824
So there'll be a little
gossip about you...

31:01.860 --> 31:02.918
in St. Petersburg.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.088
These things spread
like wildfire.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.757
l can just hear
those malicious whispers...

31:07.799 --> 31:09.096
behind my back.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.761
l'll never be able to show
my face in polite society.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.601
And if it ever got back
to my old regiment...

31:14.639 --> 31:18.075
you don't know the Fifth
Northumberland Fusioneers.

31:18.109 --> 31:20.339
They'll strike me
off the rolls.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.039
They'll cut off my pension!

31:22.080 --> 31:24.048
Watson, you're running amuck.

31:24.082 --> 31:27.483
Dishonored, disgraced,
ostracized...

31:29.654 --> 31:30.916
What am l to do?

31:31.789 --> 31:34.314
Well, for one thing,
l'd get rid of that flower.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.794
Oh, you may think
this is funny...

31:40.832 --> 31:42.629
but we're both
in the same boat.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.862
We must take
desperate measures.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.030
We must stop this talk!

31:48.706 --> 31:50.640
Maybe if we got married.

31:50.675 --> 31:52.905
Then they'd really talk.

31:55.513 --> 31:57.310
Obviously,
we cannot continue...

31:57.348 --> 31:59.316
to live under the same roof.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.079
We must move apart.

32:01.119 --> 32:02.416
Of course...

32:02.453 --> 32:04.580
we can still see each
other clandestinely...

32:04.622 --> 32:06.590
on remote benches
in Hyde Park...

32:06.624 --> 32:08.455
and in the waiting rooms...

32:08.493 --> 32:10.961
of suburban railway stations.

32:10.995 --> 32:13.122
This whole thing's ridiculous.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.428
We have nothing to hide.

32:15.466 --> 32:16.933
That's what l've been
trying to tell you.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.630
Let somebody start a rumor,
just one ugly word.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.104
We'll sue them for slander.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.436
No one would dare.

32:22.473 --> 32:25.101
After all, you have an enviable
record with the fair sex.

32:25.143 --> 32:26.110
Damn right.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.271
l can get women
from three continents...

32:28.313 --> 32:29.439
to testify for me...

32:29.480 --> 32:31.038
and you can get women
to vouch for you, too...

32:31.082 --> 32:32.447
can't you, Holmes?

32:39.824 --> 32:41.416
Can you, Holmes?

32:43.328 --> 32:44.556
Good night, Watson.

32:46.664 --> 32:47.824
Holmes.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.562
Let me ask you a question.

32:51.602 --> 32:54.298
l hope l'm not
being presumptuous...

32:54.339 --> 32:57.035
but there have been
women in your life?

32:57.075 --> 32:59.771
The answer is yes...

33:02.046 --> 33:04.776
you're being presumptuous.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.148
Good night.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.289
Holmes.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.362
What indeed was
his attitude towards women?

33:29.407 --> 33:32.467
Was there some secret
he was holding back...

33:32.510 --> 33:35.070
or was he just
a thinking machine...

33:35.113 --> 33:37.377
incapable of any emotion?

33:37.415 --> 33:39.315
l was not to get the answer...

33:39.350 --> 33:41.978
until we became involved
in what l considered to be...

33:42.020 --> 33:46.013
the most outrageous case
in all our years together.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.646
Were you expecting someone?

34:15.686 --> 34:16.880
Not at this hour.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.656
Maybe Mrs. Hudson
is entertaining.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.524
l never found her so.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.793
l don't know nothing about it.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.068
Then l'd like
to speak to the master.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.266
Well, l think he's in bed.

34:37.308 --> 34:38.605
lt's important.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.042
What is it, Mrs. Hudson?

34:40.078 --> 34:43.138
There's a cabby here,
says you owe him two and six.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.478
For what?

34:44.514 --> 34:46.141
For the fare, governor.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.243
The young lady
don't have no money.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.547
What young lady?

34:49.587 --> 34:50.952
This one.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.658
Well, what have we here?

35:04.202 --> 35:05.533
Who are you, miss?

35:07.672 --> 35:09.230
What happened to you?

35:19.851 --> 35:21.341
l don't know.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.215
That's all she keeps saying:

35:24.255 --> 35:26.189
''l don't know. l don't know.''

35:30.161 --> 35:31.355
Where did she come from?

35:31.395 --> 35:32.657
From the river.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.164
l was driving down
the embankment...

35:34.198 --> 35:35.825
just below
Westminster Bridge...

35:35.867 --> 35:39.098
and there she was
in the water, drowning.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.934
Wasn't easy, governor...

35:40.972 --> 35:44.999
what with the cold water
and her fighting me.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.976
Why did you bring her here?

35:47.011 --> 35:51.948
Because l found
this in her hand.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.508
''221-B Baker Street.''

35:54.552 --> 35:56.042
That's right, isn't it?

35:56.087 --> 35:58.783
Young lady, what did
you want at this address?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.559
l do not remember.

36:05.296 --> 36:07.389
Rather perplexing,
wouldn't you say?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.557
Rather.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.624
Well, gentlemen...

36:10.668 --> 36:13.296
you want her,
it's two and six.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.805
Or shall l throw her
back in the river?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.570
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
you can't let him do that.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.304
Watson, you better
accept delivery.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.871
Keep the change.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.314
Thank you, governor.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.947
No extra charge for the use
of the horse blanket.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.925
You're shivering, my dear.

36:35.960 --> 36:36.927
Come along...

36:36.961 --> 36:37.950
let me get you out
of those wet clothes.

37:11.829 --> 37:13.262
Sit here, my dear.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.634
She's suffering from
shock and exposure.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.522
There was some printing
on the back of this...

37:39.557 --> 37:41.548
but it seems to have
come off in the water.

37:43.661 --> 37:44.685
Look at this.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.993
She's had a nasty
blow on the head.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.124
Could she have hit
her head when she fell...

37:49.166 --> 37:50.155
or jumped into the river?

37:51.902 --> 37:54.496
No. The blood had
already coagulated.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.529
So, it would appear
that she was the victim...

37:56.574 --> 37:58.337
of a deliberate attack.

37:58.376 --> 37:59.866
Get my bag, will you?

38:05.149 --> 38:06.844
Who are you?

38:06.884 --> 38:09.114
l'm Dr. Watson...

38:09.153 --> 38:10.984
and this is Sherlock Holmes.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.819
Oh.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.291
Do the names mean
anything to you?

38:15.326 --> 38:17.123
No.

38:17.161 --> 38:18.560
Think.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.293
l'm trying.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.062
Can you think
of your own name?

38:26.504 --> 38:27.971
No.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.098
She's obviously
had a concussion...

38:30.141 --> 38:32.302
which often leads
to temporary amnesia.

38:32.343 --> 38:33.310
So, all we know...

38:33.344 --> 38:34.811
is that she was
coshed on the head...

38:34.845 --> 38:35.834
dumped into the Thames...

38:35.880 --> 38:38.348
and subsequently
dumped into our laps.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.077
We know a lot
more than that.

38:40.117 --> 38:42.176
From her accent,
we know she's foreign.

38:42.219 --> 38:43.982
From her ring,
we know she's married.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.818
There's one
other clue we have.

38:45.856 --> 38:46.823
Namely?

38:46.857 --> 38:47.915
Something l deduced...

38:47.958 --> 38:49.550
when l was helping
her up the stairs.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.156
No corset.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.162
Good work.

39:00.104 --> 39:03.005
''La Femme Elegant.''

39:04.642 --> 39:06.769
Are you French?

39:06.811 --> 39:08.972
Vous etes francaise?

39:10.815 --> 39:12.305
Non.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.443
Je ne suis pas francaise.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.046
How can she say
she's not French...

39:17.088 --> 39:18.112
in French?

39:18.155 --> 39:19.986
Vous etes suisse?

39:21.092 --> 39:22.286
Non.

39:22.326 --> 39:24.658
Alors, vous etes belge?

39:27.064 --> 39:29.032
Je ne suis pas sur.

39:35.973 --> 39:39.067
Vous etes belge, de Bruxelles?

39:40.845 --> 39:42.005
Bruxelles.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.474
Oui.

39:44.515 --> 39:46.483
Je pense que oui.

39:47.451 --> 39:49.180
Oh, dash!

39:49.220 --> 39:52.656
Will someone remove
this violin, please?

39:52.690 --> 39:54.487
We just found out
she's Belgian.

39:54.525 --> 39:55.617
Poor thing.

39:55.659 --> 39:56.819
From Brussels.

39:58.362 --> 39:59.795
lf you don't mind.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.261
ls your name Gabrielle?

40:08.506 --> 40:09.666
Gabrielle?

40:10.341 --> 40:12.172
l don't know.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.877
And your husband's
name is Emile?

40:17.214 --> 40:18.340
Emile.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.440
Where is he?

40:19.483 --> 40:21.508
What are you doing in London?

40:21.552 --> 40:23.349
l don't know.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.287
When did you arrive
from Brussels?

40:25.322 --> 40:26.949
Where are you staying?

40:26.991 --> 40:28.754
l don't know!

40:28.793 --> 40:30.727
What happened at the river?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.285
Think!

40:32.329 --> 40:33.921
Pensez!

40:35.833 --> 40:36.800
That's enough, Holmes.

40:36.834 --> 40:37.858
l will not permit you...

40:37.902 --> 40:39.369
to question her
in this condition.

40:41.238 --> 40:42.569
Here, Mrs. Hudson.

40:43.908 --> 40:46.103
Put her to bed, my bed.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.044
l'll sleep on the couch.

40:49.079 --> 40:50.444
Come on.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.242
l better give her
a sleeping draught.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.309
Watson, l think
we should arrange...

40:55.352 --> 40:57.183
to have her removed
to a hospital.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.210
Under no circumstances.

40:58.255 --> 40:59.722
She should have
medical attention.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.156
She can get that from me...

41:01.192 --> 41:03.558
but more important,
she must be protected.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.391
There's already been
one attempt on her life.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.920
This temporary amnesia,
how temporary is it?

41:07.965 --> 41:09.830
lt depends on the extent
of her injury.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.563
lt's like veils
shrouding her memory.

41:12.603 --> 41:13.968
lt could clear up
in a few days...

41:14.004 --> 41:15.164
or a few weeks.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.265
Watson, this is
a very small flat.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.003
We don't want to
clutter it up with women.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.204
Holmes, we've never
had a case like this.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.042
A woman comes to us
with a problem.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.172
We don't know
who the woman is.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.842
We don't know
what the problem is.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.009
Don't you find
that challenging?

41:27.051 --> 41:28.177
Quite...

41:28.219 --> 41:30.881
but we can't afford to wait
for these veils to lift.

41:30.921 --> 41:33.355
We must break through them
as quickly as possible.

41:33.390 --> 41:35.085
You really feel
it's that urgent?

41:35.125 --> 41:36.285
l do.

41:38.562 --> 41:40.257
The sooner
we solve the case...

41:40.297 --> 41:42.094
the sooner we can
get rid of her.

41:44.401 --> 41:45.732
Oh.

43:18.195 --> 43:19.526
Emile?

43:25.836 --> 43:27.428
Emile.

43:31.675 --> 43:33.074
Emile.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.505
ls that you, Emile?

43:41.385 --> 43:43.250
Yes, Gabrielle.

43:45.055 --> 43:46.920
Oh, Emile.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.926
l thought l would
never find you.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.794
Oh. Oh, Emile.
Hold me tight.

43:53.831 --> 43:57.358
lt's been
such a long time...

43:57.401 --> 43:59.266
so many nights.

44:00.604 --> 44:03.471
Do you know what l did
before l left Brussels?

44:03.507 --> 44:04.633
What?

44:04.675 --> 44:07.439
l hope you're not going
to be angry with me.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.140
l bought myself
an expensive negligee.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.704
Did you?

44:11.749 --> 44:17.517
A pink negligee
with marabou feathers.

44:18.789 --> 44:20.916
Don't you think it's
a little bit foolish...

44:20.958 --> 44:22.323
for a married woman?

44:23.961 --> 44:25.326
Come on.

44:28.198 --> 44:29.961
Where is the negligee?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.560
ln my luggage. Come here.

44:34.071 --> 44:36.539
And where is your luggage?

44:36.573 --> 44:39.133
Oh, l don't know.

44:40.344 --> 44:43.871
Come, Emile.
Come, come here.

44:43.914 --> 44:47.680
Please. Oh, please.
Come here.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.419
What is it, Emile?

44:59.463 --> 45:01.226
What are you doing?

45:15.679 --> 45:17.169
Dr. Watson.

45:20.017 --> 45:21.985
Porridge is getting lumpy.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.316
Hadn't you better get up?

45:24.621 --> 45:27.886
l would like to
very much, but--

45:27.925 --> 45:29.825
Mrs. Hudson, would you mind...

45:29.860 --> 45:32.158
planting your knee
in the small of my back?

45:32.196 --> 45:33.254
Yes, l would.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.731
Please. l'm in
excruciating pain.

45:37.367 --> 45:38.391
A bit higher...

45:38.435 --> 45:40.266
just below
my seventh vertebra.

45:40.304 --> 45:42.272
That's good.
Put your arms under mine.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.171
Now fold them behind my neck.

45:44.208 --> 45:45.869
Now give it a good snap.

45:46.543 --> 45:49.205
No. No. Show no mercy.
Bear down on me.

45:52.950 --> 45:54.508
Bless you.

45:54.551 --> 45:55.882
That darn couch.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.722
Oh, you better see
if our patient is awake.

46:06.997 --> 46:08.123
Dr. Watson...

46:08.165 --> 46:10.793
she's gone.

46:10.834 --> 46:12.062
Gone?

46:16.173 --> 46:18.539
Holmes! Holmes!

46:18.575 --> 46:20.338
She's gone!

46:24.348 --> 46:26.578
Well, l never.

46:30.254 --> 46:31.846
Mmm, l smell porridge.

46:31.889 --> 46:33.652
Lumpy as usual, l suppose.

46:33.690 --> 46:34.679
Ah, there you are, Holmes.

46:34.725 --> 46:36.317
We were just
wondering how, uh...

46:36.360 --> 46:38.191
We certainly were.

46:38.228 --> 46:39.820
Mrs. Hudson,
why don't you...

46:39.863 --> 46:42.491
go down to the kitchen,
get a towel, and wipe...

46:42.533 --> 46:44.626
that look of disapproval
off your face.

46:46.703 --> 46:49.171
Liberties in my house.

46:49.206 --> 46:51.003
You can't
really blame her.

46:51.041 --> 46:52.440
l mean, the way it looks.

46:52.476 --> 46:53.841
lf l didn't know you better...

46:53.877 --> 46:56.368
l might suspect you'd taken
advantage of the young lady.

46:56.413 --> 46:58.506
As a matter of fact,
l did take advantage of her.

46:58.549 --> 47:00.016
Would you hand me
the butter knife, please?

47:00.050 --> 47:01.278
Of course.

47:03.787 --> 47:05.277
You did what?

47:05.322 --> 47:06.619
Thank you.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.625
Holmes, this is reprehensible.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.718
Where are your
professional ethics?

47:10.761 --> 47:12.695
Have you no sense
of decency, no shame?

47:12.729 --> 47:14.788
None whatsoever.
lf you must know...

47:14.832 --> 47:17.426
l found her body
quite rewarding.

47:18.435 --> 47:19.697
You cad!

47:19.736 --> 47:23.001
Especially the palm
of her right hand.

47:24.975 --> 47:26.772
l'd rather not hear about it.

47:26.810 --> 47:28.243
Very well.
Then l won't bother...

47:28.278 --> 47:30.212
to tell you how
l traced her suitcase.

47:32.516 --> 47:33.813
That's her suitcase?

47:33.851 --> 47:35.614
Remember that piece
of soggy cardboard...

47:35.652 --> 47:37.142
with our address on it?

47:37.187 --> 47:38.654
lt was a luggage ticket.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.657
The number had
rubbed off on her hand.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.659
And since she must've
arrived from Brussels...

47:42.693 --> 47:44.558
by the boat train,
l concluded that she had...

47:44.595 --> 47:47.086
checked her belongings
at Victoria Station.

47:47.130 --> 47:48.495
By Jove, if you're right...

47:48.532 --> 47:50.500
we should find a clue
to her identity.

47:50.534 --> 47:53.697
Or at least a pink negligee
with marabou feathers.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.528
Voila.

47:56.573 --> 47:58.598
Well, let's see.
What else is in here?

48:04.982 --> 48:07.951
Now we're getting somewhere.

48:07.985 --> 48:11.113
Oh. Who do you
suppose this is?

48:19.997 --> 48:22.192
Good morning, Madame Valladon.

48:22.232 --> 48:24.700
You are Gabrielle Valladon?

48:24.735 --> 48:25.963
Yes.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.301
And this is your husband
Emile Valladon.

48:28.338 --> 48:30.329
Yes.

48:30.374 --> 48:32.308
Sorry to have
ransacked your valise...

48:32.342 --> 48:34.572
but since you
came to us for help...

48:35.679 --> 48:37.306
Where am l?

48:37.347 --> 48:40.805
221-B Baker Street.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.045
Oh, yes.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.653
Which one of you
is Sherlock Holmes...

48:45.689 --> 48:47.020
and which is Dr. Watson?

48:47.057 --> 48:48.820
Dr. Watson
is the handsome one.

48:51.161 --> 48:53.561
That's the way
he affects most women.

48:55.365 --> 48:57.333
Coffee. You want
some strong coffee.

48:57.367 --> 48:59.927
lt's all so confusing.

48:59.970 --> 49:01.904
Well, let's try to sort it out.

49:03.173 --> 49:06.438
You came to London
looking for your husband, right?

49:06.476 --> 49:08.774
Yes.

49:08.812 --> 49:10.780
He's a mining engineer.

49:10.814 --> 49:13.783
We were married
five years ago in the Congo.

49:13.817 --> 49:16.285
Where your husband was
working in a copper mine.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.344
How did you know?

49:17.387 --> 49:19.150
Your wedding ring--
it's made of copper.

49:22.626 --> 49:26.756
Last year, he invented
a new kind of air pump...

49:26.797 --> 49:30.733
and was hired by an English
company--Jonah, Limited.

49:30.767 --> 49:31.961
Here we are.

49:33.337 --> 49:35.032
Jonah, Limited. Go on.

49:37.007 --> 49:39.032
We've been writing
to each other regularly...

49:39.076 --> 49:41.010
then suddenly...

49:41.044 --> 49:44.480
three weeks ago,
his letters stopped.

49:44.514 --> 49:47.642
l kept on writing,
but no answer.

49:47.684 --> 49:52.018
So, finally l decided
to go to that address.

49:53.123 --> 49:55.091
''32 Ashdown Street.''

49:56.360 --> 50:00.490
Yes. lt's just
an empty store...

50:00.530 --> 50:02.691
nobody there.

50:02.733 --> 50:06.464
So, l tried to find
Jonah, Limited.

50:06.503 --> 50:09.404
No such company exists.

50:09.439 --> 50:11.430
How decidedly odd.

50:11.475 --> 50:13.568
Madame Valladon, can
you think of any reason...

50:13.610 --> 50:15.544
why your husband
should've lied to you...

50:15.579 --> 50:17.604
about these things?

50:17.647 --> 50:19.842
Emile? Never.

50:19.883 --> 50:22.283
He loves me, and l love him.

50:22.319 --> 50:24.116
l gathered that much.

50:26.089 --> 50:28.057
l went to the police.

50:28.091 --> 50:29.058
They said they would...

50:29.092 --> 50:31.526
send out a missing
persons report...

50:31.561 --> 50:34.359
but they didn't
sound too encouraging.

50:34.398 --> 50:36.366
Then l went to
the Belgian embassy.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.369
They suggested
l should consult you.

50:39.403 --> 50:41.371
You could've done worse.

50:41.405 --> 50:43.032
l was on my way here.

50:43.073 --> 50:47.009
Then suddenly there were
footsteps behind me...

50:47.044 --> 50:49.410
and a hand over my mouth...

50:49.446 --> 50:53.348
and a smell of chloroform,
and the next thing l knew...

50:53.383 --> 50:55.374
l was in the water.

50:55.419 --> 50:58.513
And then a man was
wrapping me in a blanket.

50:58.555 --> 50:59.522
Madame Valladon...

50:59.556 --> 51:01.490
somebody tried to
kill you last night.

51:01.525 --> 51:03.288
Do you have any idea
who could've done it?

51:03.326 --> 51:06.318
l don't understand any of it.

51:06.363 --> 51:09.332
Oh, what does it all
mean, Mr. Holmes?

51:09.366 --> 51:10.833
Where is my husband?

51:10.867 --> 51:12.664
You must help me find him.

51:12.702 --> 51:14.693
We'll do our best,
l assure you.

51:17.874 --> 51:21.002
Madame Valladon,
l want you to send...

51:21.044 --> 51:23.535
one more letter
to your husband.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.880
To Emile Valladon...

51:28.418 --> 51:30.852
Ashdown Street--
what was that number?

51:30.887 --> 51:32.218
Thirty-two.

51:33.256 --> 51:35.588
What do you want me
to say in the letter?

51:35.625 --> 51:36.853
Nothing.

51:36.893 --> 51:37.860
Nothing?

51:37.894 --> 51:39.691
Holmes...

51:39.729 --> 51:42.493
you're sending
an empty sheet of paper...

51:42.532 --> 51:43.692
to an empty shop?

51:43.733 --> 51:45.394
That empty shop is
obviously being used...

51:45.435 --> 51:48.029
as an accommodation
address or letter drop.

51:48.071 --> 51:50.869
But what gets dropped
must be picked up.

51:50.907 --> 51:54.570
The question is how
and by whom...

51:54.611 --> 51:55.908
and why?

52:30.180 --> 52:31.340
Hammer.

52:32.182 --> 52:33.444
Chisel.

53:13.990 --> 53:15.287
Here.

53:18.595 --> 53:19.994
lt's so strange to think...

53:20.030 --> 53:24.194
l've been writing to a place
like this all these months.

53:31.575 --> 53:34.271
Look. Canaries.

53:35.779 --> 53:37.440
Suppose this could've
been a pet shop?

53:37.481 --> 53:39.244
Maybe.

53:39.282 --> 53:40.442
Shh.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.582
Here comes our letter.

53:53.630 --> 53:55.598
Well, now we are faced with...

53:55.632 --> 53:58.328
the most nerve-racking part
of a detective's job--

53:58.368 --> 54:01.599
doing nothing...just waiting.

54:01.638 --> 54:03.299
-Mr. Holmes?
-Mm-hmm.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.604
l don't know how l'm
going to pay for all this.

54:05.642 --> 54:07.371
The purse with my money in it...

54:07.410 --> 54:09.105
is somewhere at
the bottom of the Thames.

54:09.146 --> 54:10.170
lt could be worse.

54:10.213 --> 54:11.544
You could be
at the bottom of the Thames...

54:11.581 --> 54:15.108
much to your discomfort
and much to my chagrin.

54:15.886 --> 54:18.411
l don't understand how anybody
picks up letters here.

54:19.589 --> 54:22.080
There's no footprints,
just tracks.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.393
What does it mean?

54:25.428 --> 54:28.397
l would surmise somebody
was using ice skates...

54:28.431 --> 54:31.423
if it weren't for
a conspicuous absence of ice.

54:37.541 --> 54:38.872
What do we do now?

54:38.909 --> 54:41.104
This way.

54:48.185 --> 54:49.846
Oh.

54:55.125 --> 54:58.424
Good morning, my pretties.

54:58.461 --> 55:01.430
Here's Mum with your breakfast.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.489
You think l'd forgotten you?

55:05.902 --> 55:10.430
Some of you will be going
on a little trip soon.

55:10.473 --> 55:12.373
l hate to lose you...

55:12.409 --> 55:15.503
but even an old woman's
got to live.

55:15.545 --> 55:18.139
Though you might well ask why.

55:18.181 --> 55:20.240
Oh. Oh!

55:20.283 --> 55:25.016
You never told me.
We have a letter.

55:36.933 --> 55:38.093
Ooh!

55:49.512 --> 55:51.343
-Got it?
-Yeah. All right.

55:51.381 --> 55:54.714
Come on, you old body.

55:54.751 --> 55:56.218
Right. l'll be taking them.

55:56.253 --> 55:58.585
Morning, duchess.

55:58.622 --> 55:59.646
Good morning.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.418
What have you been
doing with yourself?

56:01.458 --> 56:02.584
What do you think?

56:02.626 --> 56:05.390
Taking dancing lessons.

56:07.297 --> 56:09.765
How many do you
want this time?

56:09.799 --> 56:10.891
Two dozen.

56:12.335 --> 56:15.361
What are you doing
with all those canaries?

56:15.405 --> 56:16.997
What's going on up there?

56:17.040 --> 56:20.373
Now, duchess, we don't know,
and we don't want to know.

56:20.410 --> 56:21.672
When you work for Jonah...

56:21.711 --> 56:24.179
it's better not
to ask questions.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.203
Come on.

56:25.248 --> 56:27.614
Six, eight, ten--get in there.

56:27.651 --> 56:31.348
Fourteen, seventeen--in you go.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.948
Twenty, twenty-four.

56:33.990 --> 56:36.083
How about that letter?
Does that go, too?

56:36.126 --> 56:39.994
No. This is going to be
picked up in person.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.430
Go on.

56:43.466 --> 56:44.728
Right, you got it?

56:44.768 --> 56:45.928
Wait.

56:46.836 --> 56:47.996
All right. Up.

56:48.939 --> 56:51.635
All right, my pretties.

56:51.675 --> 56:54.371
Back to sleep you go.

56:58.615 --> 57:00.344
Ooh!

57:21.571 --> 57:23.869
l really thought
we were done for.

57:23.907 --> 57:26.535
The art of concealment,
my dear Watson...

57:26.576 --> 57:28.874
is merely a matter of
being in the right place...

57:28.912 --> 57:30.379
at the right time.

57:33.416 --> 57:35.543
Did you hear what she said?

57:35.585 --> 57:37.883
You really think Emile
is going to pick up...

57:37.921 --> 57:38.888
the letter himself?

57:38.922 --> 57:41.982
lt certainly would
simplify things, wouldn't it?

57:42.025 --> 57:45.426
Letter drops,
wheelchairs, canaries?

57:46.963 --> 57:49.227
And what was
all that about Jonah?

57:49.265 --> 57:51.495
And what do you suppose
they're doing up there?

57:51.534 --> 57:52.558
And where is up there?

57:52.602 --> 57:56.732
My guess would be Scotland...
lnverness, to be more precise.

57:56.773 --> 57:57.740
lnverness?

57:57.774 --> 58:01.107
Didn't you notice the paper
at the bottom of their cage?

58:01.144 --> 58:03.135
''The lnverness Courier.''

58:04.614 --> 58:07.412
Mr. Holmes, this letter.

58:07.450 --> 58:08.542
What about it?

58:09.819 --> 58:12.344
lt is addressed to you.

58:12.389 --> 58:13.617
To me?

58:15.725 --> 58:18.193
But that's impossible.
We sent it ourselves.

58:18.228 --> 58:19.456
Nevertheless.

58:23.733 --> 58:25.291
''My dear Sherlock...

58:25.335 --> 58:27.997
''l expect you and Dr. Watson
to join me at the club...

58:28.038 --> 58:30.006
''immediately upon
receipt of this note.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.974
''According to my calculations...

58:32.008 --> 58:34.806
''that should be at 11 :40 A.M.

58:34.844 --> 58:37.369
''Your brother Mycroft.''

58:37.414 --> 58:39.814
What time do you
make it, Watson?

58:42.085 --> 58:43.211
11 :43.

58:43.253 --> 58:46.381
Either your watch is wrong
or Mycroft has miscalculated...

58:46.423 --> 58:49.688
and knowing Mycroft,
l suggest you reset your watch.

58:49.726 --> 58:51.125
Right.

59:03.773 --> 59:05.263
Holmes...

59:05.308 --> 59:06.741
l don't mind telling you...

59:06.776 --> 59:08.573
l'm a bit apprehensive
about this.

59:08.611 --> 59:10.670
l'm rather curious myself
to know what's going on...

59:10.713 --> 59:12.340
in that Machiavellian
mind of his.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.350
No. l don't mean Mycroft.
l mean Madame Valladon.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.510
Oh, don't worry.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.179
She'll be perfectly safe
with Mrs. Hudson.

59:20.356 --> 59:21.789
To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

59:21.825 --> 59:22.849
Right you are, sir.

59:22.892 --> 59:25.190
He's expecting you
in the upstairs study.

59:25.228 --> 59:26.889
Now, if you gentlemen
will sign in.

59:26.930 --> 59:30.161
Surname, Christian name,
address, nature of business.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.095
Gentlemen!

59:59.929 --> 01:00:02.898
Hmm. Jamaican, no doubt.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:08.768
Either Tropical or Golacina.
l'm not quite sure.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:19.014
Come in.

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.743
Come in, Sherlock, Dr. Watson.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.216
Sit down.

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:24.880
You're looking very fit,
both of you.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.445
Thank you.

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.184
How are you, Mycroft?
How's your gout?

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:31.625
Under control, except for
an occasional twinge.

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:35.688
l've got a treat for you--
very old Madeira, 1814.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.700
There are only six bottles
left in the world.

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:38.860
l've got two of them...

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.369
and l'm negotiating
for a third.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.836
lf you don't mind
my saying so...

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.499
anybody who's susceptible
to gout shouldn't be...

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:45.940
The last doctor who
warned me about that...

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.943
was crossing Picadilly,
slipped on an orange peel...

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.410
and was run over
by a delivery van...

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:50.878
from Fortnum and Mason.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.211
To your very good health.

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.876
Why are you wasting
this precious stuff on us?

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:57.716
l see you so rarely.
How long has it been?

01:00:57.754 --> 01:01:00.723
Not since the, uh, case of
the Greek interpreter.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.054
lsn't it ridiculous?

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:04.059
Two brothers,
living in the same town.

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.618
Same town, perhaps,
but not in the same world.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:09.762
This is superb.

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.061
How old did you say it was?

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.433
1814. One year before Waterloo.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:17.564
One year before Waterloo!

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.835
Think of that!

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:22.174
You do know where Waterloo is,
don't you, Doctor?

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.306
Why, it's...

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.679
lt's in Belgium, isn't it?

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.351
Quite.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.012
And speaking of Belgium...

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.681
it has come to my attention...

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.189
that you are interested
in the whereabouts...

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:35.691
of a certain engineer.

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.022
Yes, l am.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.187
Well, l can save you
a lot of trouble.

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.356
l'd be grateful
for any suggestion.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:44.025
My suggestion is that
you pursue it no further.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.035
For any particular reason?

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.367
Because it involves
the national security.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.201
We are handling
the matter ourselves.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.707
We? Who's we?

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.368
The Diogenes Club, of course.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.376
l didn't say that.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.502
l've always suspected...

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.206
there was some kind of
underground connection...

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.373
between this stodgy...

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.712
and seemingly calcified
establishment...

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.217
and the Foreign Office
in Whitehall.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:03.719
That is neither here nor there.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:06.517
lt seems to me the Diogenes Club
is here, there, and everywhere.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.649
When there are rumblings
of revolt in the Sudan...

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.989
an expedition
subsidized by your club...

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:13.518
conveniently shows up to study
the source of the Nile.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.724
When there's trouble along
the lndian frontier...

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.926
some of your fellow members
pop up in the Himalayas...

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:20.492
allegedly looking for
the Abominable Snowman.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.534
What a vivid imagination
my brother has.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.907
At the age of five...

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.536
by carefully observing
a neighbor's house...

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.910
he deduced that babies
were brought...

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.915
not by the stork
but by the midwife--

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.246
in her satchel.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.445
As good an explanation as any.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.249
Yes, Wiggins?

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.918
An immediate answer
is requested, sir.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.119
Oh, yes.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.936
Tell them that the three boxes
go to Glennahurich...

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.767
and the red runner
goes to the castle.

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.067
The three boxes to Glennahurich.

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.597
The red runner to the castle.
Very good, sir.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.379
Why don't you crumple it up
and swallow it...

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:12.513
just to make sure?

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:15.046
My dear Sherlock,
there are certain affairs...

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.991
that do not come
within the province...

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.051
of the private detective.

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:20.892
They have to be dealt with...

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.955
on an altogether
different level.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.227
ln other words...

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.292
you want me to stay
within my limits.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:27.462
l do, indeed.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:28.595
And speaking of limits...

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.163
what, exactly,
is ''Jonah, Limited''?

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.466
Sherlock, when l said
drop this case...

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.840
it was not merely a suggestion.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.242
lt was an order.

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.405
By whose authority?

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.074
By the authority of
Her Majesty's government.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.242
l hope l have made myself clear.

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.250
Perfectly.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.779
And now if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen...

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.259
Good-bye, sir.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:51.783
A pleasure, as always.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.365
Just a minute.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:02.635
You forgot your...''tool kit.''

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:16.282
You will be gentle, won't you...

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.718
when you tell her
you're dropping the case?

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:19.244
Watson, what does
the word Glennahurich...

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.516
suggest to you?

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:21.523
Absolutely nothing.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.683
-lt's Scottish.
-ls it?

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:25.387
And like all Scottish names,
it's really a word picture.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:28.727
Glen means ''valley,''
na means ''of the''...

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:31.063
and hurich,
if memory serves me...

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.533
means ''yew tree.''

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.729
You're just
trying to impress me.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.798
So, the three boxes go to
the valley of the yew tree.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:54.381
And l'll be in Scotland before--

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:56.085
You are dropping the case,
aren't you, Holmes?

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.285
Open that door.

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.361
Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.768
You're liable to lose
two excellent tenants.

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:10.568
Oh, at last.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:13.370
lt's been a ghastly experience.

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:14.706
Why? What's happened?

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.211
Did you ever try
doing embroidery...

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.712
with a gun in your hand?

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.181
You'll be relieved to know
it was not loaded.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:26.522
Holmes, are you planning
to disobey Mycroft's orders?

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:28.387
He's not just
your brother, you know.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.086
You'll be defying
Her Majesty's government.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.757
Any news?
Did you find out anything?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.459
Let's just say l know
what the next step will be.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:41.470
Yes?

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:42.528
l want you to pack your things.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.903
Where are we going?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.237
Holmes, let me caution you--

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.265
At 7:30 this evening,
Dr. Watson and l...

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.210
are going to take you
to Victoria Station...

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.906
and put you on the boat train.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.073
The boat train?

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.240
Oh, that's better.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.216
You're sending me
back to Brussels...

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.240
is that it?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.547
Madame Valladon,
you must understand--

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:59.077
l came here to find my husband.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.554
You were going to help me.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.922
Yes, my dear,
but circumstances have changed.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.052
The great detective.

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:08.356
Maybe this case is
too small for you.

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:09.364
On the contrary...

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.888
it's being handled
on a much higher--

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.400
l won't go back to Brussels!

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:14.426
Maybe you're giving up,
but l am not.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.438
l'm going to go on
looking for him...

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.030
and nobody's going to stop me!

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.735
Even if they try to kill me!

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.709
Are you quite finished?

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:23.968
lf you recall,
what l said was that...

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.776
we were going to put
you on the boat train.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.908
l didn't say you were
going to stay on it.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:28.917
She's not?

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.919
At 7:30, Mr. Holmes
and Dr. Watson...

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:33.251
will be seen waving good-bye
to Madame Valladon...

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:34.415
at Victoria Station.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.858
At 8:1 2, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown...

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:40.488
accompanied by
their valet John...

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.088
will appear at Euston Station...

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.656
and board the Highland Express
to lnverness.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.692
Mister and missis.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:48.897
Thank you.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.934
l'm sorry for what l said.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.571
That's not necessary.

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.012
l'll go and pack.

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:01.078
Maybe l should do it,
since l'm the valet.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.744
Holmes, exactly what
are you up to?

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.083
As you like to put it
in your chronicles...

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.418
the game is afoot!

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:07.547
But what game?

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.252
Are you really that interested
in the Belgian engineer?

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:13.262
Or is it the wife of
the Belgian engineer?

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:21.195
You don't like me
very much, do you?

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.865
Nothing of the sort.
Quite the opposite...

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:26.739
but there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.139
Looking for something?

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.377
Yes. My other glove.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.377
Let me help you.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.693
Here it is.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.398
Thank you.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.068
All right. You can look now.

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:34.868
Am l embarrassing you,
Mr. Holmes?

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.707
Not at all.
Would it surprise you...

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:40.113
if l told you l once
spent a night with 1 21 women?

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.116
Oh?

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.586
A very interesting case--
in a harem in Constantinople.

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:56.398
Oh! l'm...sorry, Father.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:59.765
l mean, Friar. Or is it Abbot?

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:11.011
Going to Scotland,
you gentlemen?

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.207
So are we.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:21.019
l'm a valet.

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:25.015
My master and mistress and l
are on our way to lnverness.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.791
Ever been there?
Beautiful country.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:30.999
Oh, forgive me.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.332
You must be one of those orders
that's taken the vow of silence?

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.099
Trappists,
l think you're called.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.408
l see you're reading
''The Book of Jonah.''

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.316
Funny. We were just talking
about Jonah this morning.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.147
Never mind.

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:07.591
Hmm...''Women are never
to be entirely trusted...

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:09.797
''not the best of them.''

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:10.897
What did you say?

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.134
l didn't say it.

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.734
You did,
according to Dr. Watson.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:18.110
He gave me some old copies
of ''Strand Magazine.''

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:21.913
The good doctor is constantly
putting words into my mouth.

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.748
Then you deny it.

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.754
Not at all.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.916
l am not a wholehearted
admirer of womankind.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.557
l'm not very fond
of them myself.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:40.629
The most affectionate woman
l ever knew was a murderess.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:41.931
Oh?

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.939
lt was one of those
passionate affairs...

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:46.771
at odd hours
right in my laboratory.

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.436
And all the time,
behind my back...

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.944
she was stealing cyanide...

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:52.812
to sprinkle on her husband's
steak and kidney pie.

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.679
You mustn't judge all women by--

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.945
Of course not.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.953
Only the ones l
was involved with...

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.852
and l don't just
mean professionally.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:05.225
Kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs,
pyromaniacs...

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.989
Take my fiancee, for instance.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.588
Your...fiancee?

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:13.261
She was the daughter
of my violin teacher.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:16.931
We were engaged to be married,
the invitations were out...

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:19.236
l was being fitted
for a tailcoat...

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.243
and twenty-four hours
before the wedding...

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.245
she died of influenza.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.541
l'm sorry.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:28.539
lt just proves my contention
that women are unreliable...

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:31.246
and not to be trusted.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.955
Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.995
Good night, Mr. Ashdown.

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.780
Sie sputen mach lnverness.
Doch steigen die aus.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.309
Dort mussen wir
finden den Valladon.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.135
l will take that.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.603
Let's see now.
One, two, three, four, five.

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.799
How do you get to Glennahurich?

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.966
How far is it?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.305
Glennahurich...

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.470
You know, a valley
with a yew tree.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.479
lt's about a mile
out of the town.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.310
Why do you want to go there?

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.146
Well, it sounds like
a nice, peaceful place...

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.151
for a picnic.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.447
lt's a peaceful place,
right enough...

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:39.249
but it's no place for a picnic.

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.255
Why not?

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:41.551
Because it's a cemetery.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.819
The three boxes!
ls that it, Holmes?

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.660
l would think so.

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:27.431
The two small ones--
they must be children's coffins.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:49.818
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.621
ln sure and certain hope...

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.992
of the Resurrection
to eternal life...

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:56.520
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.692
The grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.168
and the love of God...

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.501
and the Communion
of the Holy Spirit...

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.268
be with us all.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.467
Amen.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.356
lt's so sad.

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.694
Sad and rather odd.

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:33.190
There were no flowers
and no mourners.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.973
Good morning.

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.177
Morning.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.617
Working you hard, dad?

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.519
No, not really.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:55.955
You see,
this is healthy country.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:59.119
Sometimes, you sit around
for weeks with nothing to do.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.753
Then you get three in one day.

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:01.854
What happened?

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.626
An accident, aye.

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.826
A father and two sons,
they say.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.927
They were found floating
in the loch.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.028
Local people?

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:11.505
No, no. No one
around here knows 'em.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.100
The story is their boat
capsized in a swell...

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.111
but l don't believe it.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:17.772
What do you believe?

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.781
Well, you may think
l'm an old fool...

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.783
an old drunk, but...

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:25.344
l've been living around
Loch Ness all me life.

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:29.455
Are you trying to tell us
it was the monster?

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.856
Damn right.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.485
MacLaren saw the kids' faces...

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.120
when they were pulled
out of the water.

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:36.063
Looked just like old men.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.963
They must've died of fright.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.967
That's incredible.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.434
ls it?

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.300
Last Easter Sunday,
the wife and me...

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:45.534
on our way to services,
when suddenly...

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:48.338
Ah, what's the use?

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:50.839
Here you are, dad.

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:54.909
Thank you. Thank you.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.417
You seem like nice people.

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:58.352
lf you're wanting a holiday
in Scotland...

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.617
go to Loch Lomond,
go to Holy Loch...

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:03.648
but stay away from Loch Ness.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.628
To think that people
still believe in that nonsense.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.191
l mean, here we are, living
in the nineteenth century.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.066
l'm ashamed to admit it,
but l was relieved...

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:17.231
when he mentioned
a father and two boys.

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:19.797
lt couldn't have anything
to do with Emile.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:20.968
lt would appear not.

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:23.671
However, there still remains
the clue of the castle...

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.771
and the red runner,
whoever he may be.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.680
lf they're
unidentified graves...

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.546
why are those boys
bringing flowers?

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.778
Because it's their brothers
who have just been buried.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:04.808
Their brothers?

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:06.150
And they're not boys.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.315
They're as tall
as they'll ever grow.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.619
Hand me some pebbles.

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.750
Pebbles?

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.424
Take a look at their faces.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:36.273
They are...how do you
call them in English?

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.751
Midgets.

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.553
Boys with the faces of old men.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.057
l still don't see--

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:45.992
Would it help if l told you
they were acrobats?

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:47.896
Not at all.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.557
Do you remember a tumbling act--

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:51.964
six brothers missing
from the circus?

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:55.102
That case you turned down.

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.434
l completely forgot.

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:59.599
Some of us are cursed with
memories like flypaper...

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:01.438
and stuck there is
a staggering amount...

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:05.469
of miscellaneous data,
mostly useless.

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:26.757
Mr. Holmes...if those
are not children, then--

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:27.962
Quite.

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.304
The question now is,
who's in the third grave?

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:09.934
Holmes! She's fainted!

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.678
Hand me that lantern.

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:18.211
lt is Valladon, isn't it?

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:23.018
Obviously...but what
is not so obvious...

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:26.687
is why his wedding ring
has turned green...

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:30.357
and why there are three
dead canaries in the coffin.

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:34.298
White canaries.

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.900
You've a lovely view
of the loch from here...

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.241
as soon as the morning mist
rolls away.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:19.907
lf you have a mind to do
any sightseeing...

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:23.384
here's a guide to all
the local points of interest.

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:24.646
Thank you.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.145
This way, please.
l'll show you to your room.

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:33.357
l suppose you're putting
me in the basement.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.693
No, your room's in the attic.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:36.789
Good.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.459
lt's the privy that's
in the basement.

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:40.628
Oh.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.909
May l have your
wedding ring, please?

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:20.399
Just as l thought--

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:22.740
there is a distinct
difference in color...

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:25.076
between your ring
and your husband's...

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:27.240
which leads me to believe
that the cause of death...

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.750
was not drowning.

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:31.776
l wish you would stop that.

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.284
Stop it!

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:41.095
lf we are to continue,
if we are to find out...

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.323
what really happened
to your husband...

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.559
you cannot act
the grief-stricken widow.

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:47.932
l'm--l'm...sorry.

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.572
l know it's not easy,
but you must remember...

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.665
we're that nice couple
from London...

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.369
on holiday in the Highlands.

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:58.874
l'll try.

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:03.944
That's much better.

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:04.974
Thank you.

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:11.152
Now, if l may proceed without
further interruptions.

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:12.592
Mr. Ashdown!

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.662
Holmes, l saw it.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.794
l saw it from the attic window.
lt's out there in the lake!

01:22:21.837 --> 01:22:23.361
-You saw what?
-Telescope!

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:24.633
Where's the telescope?

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.133
What did you see?

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:32.779
The monster.

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:33.974
The monster?

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:43.222
There--there it is!

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.437
Look for yourself.

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:57.904
There it is there.
There, there.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:58.963
See it?

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.205
There. See it?

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:04.337
l see nothing.

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:05.539
Nothing?

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:09.016
lt's gone.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.642
Gone? Maybe it was never there.

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:13.119
Holmes, l swear to you,
l saw it as clear as anything!

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:15.122
Watson, as you
so succinctly put it...

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.714
we are living in
the nineteenth century.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.726
Maybe that grave digger
was right--

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.591
the swell
and the boat overturning.

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.756
Monsieur Valladon may have
been found in the lake...

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.025
but he did not drown.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.828
He died of asphyxiation.

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:29.934
Asphyxiation?

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.131
There's only one substance...

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.867
that can turn
a copper ring green...

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:35.308
and bleach the color
out of canaries--

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.332
chlorine gas.

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.608
Well, that may be,
but the fact remains...

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:41.616
that l saw something out there!

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.845
A figment of your imagination.

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:46.115
Now let us be logical.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:50.147
The only concrete lead we have
is the reference to the castle.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:54.150
The question is...which castle?

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.628
You call yourself logical?

01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:59.259
You're the least
logical man l know.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:00.632
Am l?

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:04.161
How can you say it's a figment
of my imagination...

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:06.173
when for years
you've been saying...

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:10.576
l have no imagination
whatsoever?

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:08.985
We have so far investigated
eight drafty castles...

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.225
had our bicycles
attacked by sheep...

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:13.427
and our ears assaulted
by bagpipes...

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:15.436
and we are exactly
where we started.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.438
Would you like some more
cranberry sauce, dear?

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.769
Yes, dear.

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:20.775
Would you pass
the cranberry sauce, John?

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:21.798
Yes, dear.

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:28.408
l say there!

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:31.146
Good afternoon! Remember me?

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.621
There's some chaps
l met on the train.

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.681
We had a long conversation,
or rather...

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:37.953
l had a long conversation...

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:40.187
because they are
not allowed to talk.

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.958
Trappists, you know?
Just study their bibles.

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:43.964
Oh, you'll never guess...

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:45.625
what the one next
to me was reading--

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.465
''The Book of Jonah.''
lsn't that odd?

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:50.631
Quite.

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.981
What is it, dear?
What's the matter?

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:02.175
Oh, a bee!

01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:30.202
Well, l don't think
we have to bother...

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:31.212
with this castle.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.873
lt's just a pile of rubble.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:36.975
Then why are they taking
all these precautions?

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.248
Why, indeed?

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:42.949
-Let's go.
-Go where?

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.788
When rebuffed
at the front door...

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:47.659
one's only choice is to try
the tradesman's entrance.

01:28:09.551 --> 01:28:12.679
Sorry. No visitors allowed.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.914
Are you the guide here?

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:16.253
Yes, but the castle
is closed to the public...

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.553
while work is going on.

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.991
Oh, what are they doing?

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.551
lt's being restored
by the Society...

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:22.756
for the Preservation
of Scottish Monuments.

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:23.764
Oh, that's too bad.

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.232
l particularly wanted my wife
to see Urquhart Castle.

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:28.292
The tower is one of
the most interesting examples...

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.769
of medieval architecture.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.567
About 1400, wasn't it?

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:32.766
That's right.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:36.800
Let me see, was it built
by James ll or James lll?

01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:39.575
The lll, but if you'd like
to come back next year...

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.603
we'll be finished then...

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.910
and l'll be glad
to show you around.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.144
Thank you.

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:04.794
Pleasant sort, isn't he?

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.306
Pleasant, but ignorant.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.139
He was off one hundred years
and one James.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:12.203
lt's actually 1500 and James lV.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:17.910
lf he's an official guide,
shouldn't he know?

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.579
lf he's an official guide.

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.121
Listen, do you hear
anything, Watson?

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:30.090
No. Those birds are making
too much of a racket.

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.826
They're not just birds.

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:34.662
They're our old friends.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.449
Sulfuric acid.

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:54.114
The more we find out,
the less sense it makes.

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:57.386
To a graduate chemist,
it makes a great deal of sense.

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:59.791
Sulfuric acid when
exposed to salt water...

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.658
produces chlorine gas.

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.967
John, would you mind
clasping your hands, please?

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.298
Like that?

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.463
No, like that. Lower.

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:12.869
Thank you.

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:36.263
That tower may be more
interesting than l thought...

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:39.731
and not just architecturally.

01:30:47.342 --> 01:30:50.869
Holmes...l have a feeling
we're redundant here.

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:15.461
We have now
observed the castle...

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:16.970
from the front, from the back...

01:31:17.005 --> 01:31:19.098
from the side,
from land, from water.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.233
What now? Planning to spend
the night out here?

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.435
lf necessary.

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:26.440
You're gonna catch
your death of cold, you know.

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:30.342
Wouldn't it be ironic
if Holmes' last case...

01:31:30.385 --> 01:31:31.750
were a case of pneumonia?

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.315
Sorry.

01:31:40.395 --> 01:31:41.885
What's that?

01:31:48.369 --> 01:31:49.461
Holmes!

01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:53.206
There's--a--

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.266
Quick, Watson! After it!

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.571
Holmes, what are we doing?

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.573
We should be going away from it!

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.507
Keep rowing, damn it!

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.094
We've lost it.

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:55.931
At least you admit
there is an it...

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.097
not just a figment
of my imagination!

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.299
Quiet!

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.736
Do you have your
stethoscope with you?

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.304
Never without it.

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.520
What is it?

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:19.253
l can hear something.

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:24.431
lt's getting closer...

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:27.631
and closer...

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:43.810
Holmes!

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.648
Get back! Get back!

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.954
Get back--you beast--

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:04.604
Are you all right?

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:07.199
l lost my parasol.

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.738
Where's Watson?

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:18.215
Watson!

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.230
Thank you.

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:44.138
l...have come face to face
with man-eating tigers.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:46.203
l was once caught
in a stampede...

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:48.681
of wild elephants--
lndia, you know--

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:50.616
but l wasn't half as frightened.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:53.586
This beast seems to have
a personal grudge against us!

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:56.317
Well, l just hope
it doesn't come back!

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.824
l don't think it will.

01:34:59.327 --> 01:35:00.658
Look.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.735
What strange goings-on!

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.706
Not really.

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:17.643
l would say that the monster,
after a hard day's work...

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:19.873
has returned home
for his supper.

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:55.579
Yes, l know.

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:57.584
But would you believe
you can't borrow...

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.176
a decent pair of trousers
in this place?

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:13.525
All right, Holmes.
Want to confide in us?

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.535
Whenever he starts whistling...

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.537
l know he's getting close
to a solution.

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:19.038
lt's nothing new, actually.

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.541
We've come across
this situation before.

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:23.372
We have? Where?

01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:24.378
At the ballet.

01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:25.379
Ballet?

01:36:25.413 --> 01:36:27.040
There's a lake,
and there's a castle...

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:29.845
and there's a swan that
isn't really a swan...

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:30.851
or in this case...

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.614
a monster that
isn't really a monster.

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.312
Then what is it?

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:37.984
What is it, indeed,
that feeds on canary birds...

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:41.222
and sulfuric acid
and has an engine for a heart?

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.388
An engine?

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:44.125
The stethoscope is a very
sensitive instrument...

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:46.565
and water is an excellent
conductor of sound.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.568
There is no doubt
that we are dealing with...

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.126
a mechanical monster.

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:51.195
Oh!

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:53.297
Not only is it equipped
with an artificial heart...

01:36:53.341 --> 01:36:55.309
it also has artificial lungs.

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:58.210
Judging from the bubbles
on the surface of the lake...

01:36:58.245 --> 01:37:00.873
it uses some form of air pump.

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:04.077
You think my husband was
involved in all this?

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:07.087
Yes, Madame Valladon,
l'm sure of it.

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:10.420
But why would anybody want to
build a mechanical monster?

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:11.823
Just to scare people?

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:14.157
Not very likely.

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:16.755
Why did they try to keep me
from finding my husband?

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:20.062
And why was he
buried anonymously?

01:37:20.101 --> 01:37:22.661
l think l have
a pretty good notion...

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:23.795
of what they're up to...

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:27.205
the Society for the Preservation
of Scottish Monuments--

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.869
better known
as the Diogenes Club!

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.741
Diogenes Club?

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:33.806
Come in!

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.214
Mr. Ashdown, l have a bottle
of champagne for you.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.977
A bottle of champagne!

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:43.384
l didn't order it.

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.392
No, indeed.
You are to deliver it.

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.791
Those are my instructions.

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:49.318
lnstructions from whom?
Deliver it where?

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:50.387
l wouldn't know, sir...

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:53.093
but there's a carriage
waiting for you downstairs.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:57.564
Are you sure you've got
the right Mr. Ashdown?

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.630
Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:13.518
Well, Watson...

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:17.320
l would say the curtain
is going up on the last act.

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:19.849
l don't like the sound of it.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.486
Please be careful.

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:27.730
Holmes, you'd better
take this with you.

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:38.037
Well...who's minding
the castle?

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:40.137
You'd better get on.
lt's getting late.

01:38:40.181 --> 01:38:43.207
Where are we going?
Some sort of party?

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.548
You won't be disappointed
in the guest list.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.388
Who's the host?

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:49.787
Jonah.

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.953
Mr. Ashdown, l presume?

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:06.058
The red runner, l presume.

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.536
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble just for me.

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.504
lt's not for you. McKennah?

01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:13.803
May l have
the champagne, please?

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.502
1886.

01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:17.511
Not a very good vintage,
is it?

01:40:17.545 --> 01:40:19.843
Mediocre, but then again,
it's not for drinking.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.939
Tie it up, will you?

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:23.244
ln here.

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:32.023
lnteresting...and educational.

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:33.526
Despite my most
emphatic warning...

01:40:33.561 --> 01:40:35.028
you persisted in meddling.

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:37.223
lt would have served you right
if you had all drowned.

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:38.925
Sorry to be so unobliging.

01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:42.201
''E. Valladon.''

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.362
Hmm...

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:46.271
l imagine that this belongs
to the pretty lady...

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:48.605
and this belongs
to your...valet.

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:50.542
We found them floating
in the lake.

01:40:50.578 --> 01:40:52.546
Speaking about things
floating in the lake--

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:55.048
how much do you know?
Or...think you know?

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:58.074
l think you're testing
some sort of underwater craft...

01:40:58.118 --> 01:41:00.586
camouflaged
to mislead the gullible.

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:02.589
l think it's
an experimental model...

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.523
operated by a crew of midgets.

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.924
l think it is powered by
sulfuric acid batteries...

01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:09.987
and uses canaries
to detect escaping gas.

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.990
Altogether, a unique
contraption.

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:15.001
Not quite that unique.

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:17.469
Right now, four countries
are trying to develop...

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.495
what we call a submersible...

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.338
but none of them could
solve the critical problem--

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:25.072
how to stay submerged long
enough to make it effective.

01:41:25.613 --> 01:41:27.274
What does the good book say?

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:30.680
''And Jonah lived in
the belly of that fish...

01:41:30.718 --> 01:41:33.152
''for three days
and three nights.''

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.677
That was our goal...

01:41:34.722 --> 01:41:36.189
and thanks to
Valladon's air pump...

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:38.054
we got a jump
on the rest of them.

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:39.889
lt's a highly complex
system of filtration...

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:41.417
so we had a series of trials--

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.430
And at least one error.

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:44.931
During a test run
in the Moray Firth...

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.523
pressure caused
a leak in the hull...

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.432
sea water mixed with
the acid in the batteries...

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:50.027
to produce chlorine gas.

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.264
Before they could reach
the surface...

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.704
Valladon and two of
the crew were dead.

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.731
So you had them buried
in unmarked graves...

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:56.037
to preserve your secret.

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:57.168
lt was essential...

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.042
to keep the information
from your client!

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:00.603
You went to all those lengths...

01:42:00.648 --> 01:42:03.139
to prevent Madame Valladon
from finding her husband?

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:05.947
Your client isn't
Madame Valladon!

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:09.422
lt's the lmperial
German Government.

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.321
They were after
the Belgian engineer...

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.723
or rather his invention.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.728
They knew he was
employed by us...

01:42:14.762 --> 01:42:15.888
but they couldn't
find out where.

01:42:15.929 --> 01:42:20.389
So they enlisted the best
brain in England to help them.

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.095
You, my dear brother,

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:24.161
have been working for
the Wilhelm Strasse.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:33.245
And Madame Valladon...

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.248
what part did she play
in all of this?

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.273
Madame Valladon is dead.

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:38.409
Dead?

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:41.546
The Germans disposed of her
three weeks ago in Brussels.

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.217
This is Gabrielle Valladon.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.867
The woman who was
brought to your house...

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:01.272
in the middle of the night...

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.469
apparently fished out
of the Thames...

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.671
and apparently suffering
from amnesia...

01:43:05.713 --> 01:43:07.681
is in fact
llsa von Hoffmanstal...

01:43:07.715 --> 01:43:09.774
one of their most
skillful agents.

01:43:09.817 --> 01:43:12.718
Am l going too fast for
the best brain in England?

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:17.216
Go on.

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:20.055
They planted her on you
quite neatly, l must admit...

01:43:20.094 --> 01:43:21.061
so that you could lead them...

01:43:21.095 --> 01:43:23.290
to their objective,
the air pump...

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:27.164
very much like using a hog
to find truffles.

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:29.567
And now perhaps
you'd care to join me.

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:33.972
l'm expecting a certain
royal personage from Balmoral.

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:11.107
Your Majesty.

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:17.147
l trust you had
a pleasant journey, ma'am.

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:20.176
lt was long,
and it was tedious...

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:22.688
and it had better be
worth our while, Mr. Holmes.

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.691
l can assure you, ma'am,
it will be.

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:28.684
Now, what is this curious ship
we are supposed to christen?

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:31.664
We call it a submersible, ma'am.
lt travels under water.

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:35.190
Under water?
What a fantastic idea!

01:44:35.235 --> 01:44:37.931
Ma'am, may l present
some of the scientists...

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.268
responsible
for this achievement?

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:42.104
J.W. Ferguson, naval architect.

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:43.370
Your Majesty.

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:46.140
Professor Simson, our leading
expert in hydraulics.

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:47.305
Your Majesty.

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:50.646
W.W. Prescott, co-inventor
of the revolving periscope.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.810
Your Majesty.

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:53.820
And this is my brother
Sherlock, ma'am.

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:57.381
Ah, yes! Sherlock Holmes.

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:59.324
We have been following
your exploits...

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:00.986
with great interest!

01:45:01.027 --> 01:45:02.153
Thank you, ma'am.

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:04.959
Are you engaged in one of
your fascinating cases...

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:05.965
at the moment?

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:07.364
ln a manner of speaking, ma'am.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.526
When can we expect to read...

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.035
Dr. Watson's account
of the case?

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.128
l hope never, ma'am.

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:14.004
lt has not been one of
my more successful endeavors.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.200
Oh.

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:50.175
There she is, ma'am--
Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:04.623
And what, may we ask...

01:46:04.658 --> 01:46:07.183
is the purpose of that
hideous gargoyle?

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:08.854
Merely a decoy, ma'am.

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:12.626
Oh! To frighten away
the sharks, we imagine.

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:13.894
Something of the sort.

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:22.570
The crew will now demonstrate
the workings of the submersible.

01:46:24.344 --> 01:46:25.368
Stand to!

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:32.647
Aren't they rather small
for sailors?

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:35.154
They are, ma'am, but because of
the size of the craft...

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:36.450
the Navy made an exception.

01:46:36.489 --> 01:46:38.184
They should make it a rule.

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:41.126
lt is quite fatiguing
to pin on all those medals...

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:43.322
while standing on our toes.

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:01.611
This is the main engine
which propels us under water...

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.616
at the rate of two knots.

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.982
The reciprocating
stabilizer mechanism...

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:09.386
the high-voltage
acid batteries...

01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:13.449
the multi-stage compressor...
ballast tank trimmer...

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:16.257
the air pump which filters
and recirculates the air.

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:18.621
How charming!

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:20.292
The air pump, ma'am?

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:23.632
Canaries!
Must make the crew feel at home.

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.137
Yes, ma'am.

01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:27.139
These are for firing
the torpedoes...

01:47:27.173 --> 01:47:29.937
which are accurate
up to as much as 1 20 feet...

01:47:29.976 --> 01:47:32.467
the telescope for scanning
the surface of the water...

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.810
But where is the glass bottom?

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.372
The what, ma'am?

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.749
The glass bottom!

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:41.219
You know...to observe the fish.

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:43.586
And the plants and the cockles.

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.420
That's not quite
the idea, ma'am.

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:48.256
H.M.S. Jonah has been
commissioned as a warship.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.694
A warship?

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:58.837
Stop that noise!

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.703
Stop it!

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.435
Ma'am, if l may explain--

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:03.635
You had better!

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.144
The admiralty
regards this craft...

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:07.146
as the ultimate weapon
in naval warfare.

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.442
lt can seek out enemy ships...

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:09.914
and destroy them
with those torpedoes...

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.441
while remaining
completely invisible.

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:15.113
You mean it can fire
at other vessels...

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.452
while under water?

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:17.456
Yes, ma'am.

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.457
Without any warning?

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:19.458
That is correct, ma'am.

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.084
Without showing her colors?

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:22.355
lndeed, ma'am.

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:25.193
Mr. Holmes, we are not amused.

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:30.696
lt is unsportsmanlike,
it is un-English...

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:33.228
and it is in very poor taste!

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:36.208
We will have none of it!

01:48:36.242 --> 01:48:38.107
l beg your pardon, ma'am.

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:43.976
Sometimes we despair
at the state of the world.

01:48:44.017 --> 01:48:47.544
What will scientists
think of next?

01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:49.350
That's precisely it, ma'am.

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.413
At this very moment...

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:52.152
the Germans,
under Count von Zeppelin...

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:54.626
are experimenting
with a dirigible.

01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:57.858
A dirigible?
And what, pray, is that?

01:48:57.897 --> 01:48:59.592
A rigid balloon
which could fly over London...

01:48:59.632 --> 01:49:01.998
and drop a bomb
on Buckingham Palace.

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.900
lt is being developed
at the express orders...

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:06.132
of Kaiser Wilhelm ll.

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:10.632
Nonsense! We refuse to believe
that our grandson Willie...

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.110
would do a thing like that!

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:13.612
We have conclusive proof, ma'am.

01:49:13.646 --> 01:49:16.114
Our agent in Friedrichshafen,
a man named lbidson...

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:18.617
actually saw the dirigible
and made a drawing of it.

01:49:18.651 --> 01:49:20.118
Unfortunately,
he was apprehended...

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:22.121
before he could
cross the border.

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:26.615
Nevertheless, we want no part
of this beastly invention.

01:49:26.659 --> 01:49:29.253
Get rid of it! Scuttle it!

01:49:29.295 --> 01:49:31.195
The sooner the better!

01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.425
May l point out, ma'am--

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:33.796
And do not concern yourself...

01:49:33.833 --> 01:49:37.325
about that dirigible
dropping bombs on us.

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:41.534
We shall write a very sharp note
to the kaiser!

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:45.735
Now...we wish to return
to Balmoral.

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:08.691
Well, Mycroft...

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:11.602
it seems we have both
been undone by a woman.

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:14.607
What a shame...
all that superb engineering...

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:18.270
and all that cunning
espionage for naught.

01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:20.108
Not necessarily.

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:23.172
lf the Germans want that
submersible so badly...

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:25.548
why don't we give it to them?

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:26.950
Give it to them?

01:50:26.986 --> 01:50:29.546
lnvite them aboard
for the final journey...

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:32.023
700 feet straight down.

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:36.220
And how are you
going to arrange that?

01:50:36.262 --> 01:50:38.389
l'm rather counting
on you to do it...

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:40.558
since you're on such
intimate terms...

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.329
with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:47.196
Shall we say good-bye
to Her Majesty?

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.878
Sorry about that,
but as long as you're up...

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:40.012
what is the German word
for castle?

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:41.213
Schlos, isn't it?

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:44.317
l think so.

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:47.588
And how would you say
''under the castle''?

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:50.653
Unten das schlos...
or die schlos?

01:52:52.865 --> 01:52:55.527
l don't know.
My German is not that good.

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:58.671
Your Trappist friends...

01:52:58.705 --> 01:53:00.468
are waiting outside
to hear from you.

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.208
lt's a chilly morning.

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:03.209
We don't want to keep them...

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.710
standing around too long,
do we...

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:09.175
Fraulein Hoffmanstal?

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:17.382
Come now, it's too late
to play cat and mouse.

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:26.060
Unten dem schlos.

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:28.226
Thank you.

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:31.534
Here is your signaling device.

01:53:32.538 --> 01:53:34.062
lt's rather bent, l'm afraid.

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:36.367
Would you care to tell them...

01:53:36.409 --> 01:53:38.502
where they can find
the submersible?

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:43.575
No?

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.212
Then l shall just have
to do it myself.

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:55.385
l only hope my Morse code
is adequate to the occasion.

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:46.069
Well...it's up to
the good monks now.

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:49.013
You can consider your part
of the mission accomplished...

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.538
Fraulein Hoffmanstal.

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:56.113
You're all wrong about me.
My name is not Hoffmanstal.

01:54:56.155 --> 01:54:57.144
lt isn't?

01:54:57.190 --> 01:54:59.715
lt's von Hoffmanstal.

01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:01.954
l stand corrected.

01:55:01.994 --> 01:55:04.485
l suppose once they
are in the castle...

01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:09.827
Must amuse you, Mr. Holmes,
Trappists walking into a trap?

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.097
lt's more amusing than that.

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:13.128
Once in the castle,
they will encounter...

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.969
surprisingly little resistance.

01:55:15.007 --> 01:55:17.202
lt will take but a small
bottle of chloroform...

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.801
to overcome the guards.

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:20.779
You mean you're going to
let them have the air pump?

01:55:20.813 --> 01:55:21.780
Better than that.

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.645
We're going to let them
have the submersible.

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:27.115
They will find it with its
engines running all set to go.

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:29.178
l assume they're all
expert sailors.

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.190
And since there's
a German battleship...

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:32.748
cruising off the coast
of Scotland...

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.885
l expect they'll try to
sail it out of the loch...

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:35.859
and rendezvous at sea.

01:55:37.029 --> 01:55:38.519
Did you say try to?

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.726
l would suggest you get
your things together.

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:46.500
Mycroft will be here to
take you into custody.

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:52.707
l never had you fooled
for a moment, did l?

01:55:52.745 --> 01:55:55.270
You knew right from
the beginning...

01:55:56.416 --> 01:55:59.180
when the cabby brought me
to Baker Street.

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:02.386
Let me see.

01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:06.950
Not quite that soon.

01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:09.086
lt's so funny.

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:11.722
l asked for this
assignment, you know.

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:15.360
l was scheduled
to go to Japan...

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:17.028
but l couldn't resist
the challenge...

01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:19.401
of coming up against the best.

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:23.202
l'm sorry l didn't give you
a closer game.

01:56:25.344 --> 01:56:27.005
Close enough.

01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:30.649
You're just being kind.

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:32.583
l failed miserably.

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:36.521
We all have occasional failures.

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:40.888
Fortunately, Dr. Watson
never writes about mine.

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:46.489
Holmes!

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:58.066
Holmes! l saw it again!

01:56:58.110 --> 01:56:59.509
That thing!
lt came from the castle!

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.069
lt's out there!

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:13.124
lt was out there. Now it's gone.

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.126
-lt's gone?
-Forever.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.593
Look for yourself.

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:21.490
A bottle of champagne?

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.460
And a Bible?

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:31.239
That's all that's left
of H.M.S. Jonah.

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:33.312
Holmes!

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:36.611
For once, would you mind
being a little less cryptic?

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:38.344
lt would seem that someone
carelessly loosened...

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:40.545
the bolts of the submersible.

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:44.081
What a fitting end
for Trappists.

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:46.421
Now they are resting
in eternal silence...

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:47.983
at the bottom of the lake.

01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:53.025
Do you know what
he's talking about?

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.031
Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.

01:57:59.071 --> 01:58:01.665
Yes, Mr. Holmes. l'm all ready.

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:04.368
lf there's one thing l like
about the Prussians...

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:05.468
it's their punctuality.

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:08.537
lf there's one thing
l dislike about the British...

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:10.139
it's their climate.

01:58:10.182 --> 01:58:12.514
l understand your jails
are very damp...

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:15.988
and your heating facilities
totally inadequate.

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:17.922
They are, but you're
not going to jail.

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.015
You're going back to Germany.

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:21.521
Germany?

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:23.620
You will be conducted
to the Swiss/German border...

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:25.528
and be exchanged for one
of our agents...

01:58:25.565 --> 01:58:26.725
a man named lbidson.

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:29.535
Thank you.

01:58:29.569 --> 01:58:31.469
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank my brother.

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:32.801
lt was his idea.

01:58:37.843 --> 01:58:40.368
Frankly, l think we're
making a very poor deal.

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:41.812
You're much better
than most operatives...

01:58:41.847 --> 01:58:43.610
working for
British intelligence.

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:45.850
Don't you agree, Sherlock?

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:50.049
And better than some
consulting detectives.

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:11.336
Shall we?

01:59:19.952 --> 01:59:21.112
l'll take that.

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:30.655
Gentlemen.

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:40.772
All right, Holmes.

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:41.830
You don't have to
explain anything to me...

01:59:41.874 --> 01:59:42.841
if you don't want to.

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:43.842
l appreciate that, Watson.

01:59:43.876 --> 01:59:46.242
After all, l'm only
your official biographer!

01:59:46.278 --> 01:59:47.711
Anyway, l don't think
she would care to have...

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:50.443
this story spread all over
the ''Strand Magazine.''

01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:53.582
The public has a right
to know these things!

01:59:53.619 --> 01:59:55.610
lf she's a German spy...

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:58.146
why should we concern ourselves
about her feelings?

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.169
Giddyup.

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:26.618
Holmes, if l promise
not to write a word about it...

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:29.621
would you enlighten me,
as your friend, as your valet?

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.815
Quiet.

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.621
l'm trying to read
a personal message.

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:35.126
Message?

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:52.237
What's she saying?

02:00:54.113 --> 02:00:58.209
Auf...wiedersehen.

02:00:58.984 --> 02:01:01.782
Auf wieder--the nerve!

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:37.615
A letter from
the Diogenes Club.

02:01:37.656 --> 02:01:39.715
Maybe Mycroft is putting
you up for membership!

02:01:39.759 --> 02:01:41.556
lf only to have
the distinct pleasure...

02:01:41.594 --> 02:01:43.186
of blackballing his brother.

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:04.438
Aren't you going
to finish your breakfast?

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:01.666
Holmes, l'm terribly
sorry about this.

02:03:05.277 --> 02:03:06.471
Where is it, Watson?

02:03:09.114 --> 02:03:13.312
ln the files. May to July, 1885.

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.360
You're getting better.
