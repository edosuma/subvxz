00:08.299 --> 00:10.552
Previously on
<i>Top Chef Family Style...</i>

00:10.593 --> 00:12.762
You must create an elevated
frozen meal.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.140
Dinner is going
to be a surprise!

00:16.099 --> 00:17.559
We really need to win
this challenge.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.728
You're taking too long
on the kebabs.

00:19.769 --> 00:23.189
Let's fire up the microwave.
Yeah.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.441
I can't believe this was frozen.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.067
I'm so happy for Kaj and Liz.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.320
Kiran and Moid's beef kebab
is a little dry, right?

00:29.362 --> 00:32.240
The winning chefs
are Kaj and Liz.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.742
[applause]

00:33.783 --> 00:35.368
Congratulations!

00:35.410 --> 00:37.454
Kiran and Moid, I'm sorry.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.414
You must pack your knives
and go.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.335
Nine duos remain.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.961
I can't reach!

00:45.003 --> 00:46.046
Voila.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.714
We killed that.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.966
At stake, $50,000

00:50.008 --> 00:52.927
and the chance to be crowned
the champions

00:52.969 --> 00:54.888
of <i>Top Chef Family Style.</i>

00:54.929 --> 00:59.976
***

01:00.018 --> 01:06.441
***

01:06.483 --> 01:08.735
Finally feel like
there's less people.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.945
So you guys think you're
going home tomorrow?

01:10.987 --> 01:12.822
The real roller coaster?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.866
No, we're not going home.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.620
This is impossible.
Like how do you solve this?

01:18.661 --> 01:21.748
I definitely feel like we're the
underdogs in this competition.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.500
Since I'm a vegan,
it's a lot

01:23.541 --> 01:25.794
on Anika's shoulder
to taste everything,

01:25.835 --> 01:27.796
but I know
that she can pull it off.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.298
I'm actually really
impressed by Anika.

01:30.340 --> 01:35.637
***

01:35.679 --> 01:37.472
- Hello, chefs.
- Hello.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.308
Good morning, everyone.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.644
I hope you're feeling
very creative today.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.521
Some of you may have
been influenced

01:44.562 --> 01:46.439
by today's guest judge.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.693
Give it up for social
media sensation, foodie,

01:49.734 --> 01:52.737
and mom of three, Jessica Woo.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.199
Yay!

01:57.450 --> 01:59.994
Jessica is a very
successful content creator

02:00.036 --> 02:03.790
with over five million
social media followers.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.501
- I love you.
- Right? I'm freaking out.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.962
I watch her videos all the time.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.505
I love her style.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.632
Let's make some lunch
for my kids.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.635
She inspires me to push
out content every day

02:15.677 --> 02:18.138
to every other day trying
to grow my platform.

02:18.179 --> 02:23.560
I don't think I'm famous, but
I have about 65,000 followers.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.187
Eva has an amazing following.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.856
She's a little
too proud sometimes.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.483
I don't think I could
ever be too proud.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.737
Chefs, I rely on a lot
of tools in my kitchen,

02:33.778 --> 02:38.867
but under your cloche is
one tool I cannot live without.

02:38.908 --> 02:43.204
***

02:43.246 --> 02:47.876
On the count of three, everyone
grab your cloche and lift it up.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.337
One, two, three.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.755
Lift it up!

02:51.796 --> 02:54.758
[laughter]

03:00.597 --> 03:03.767
Many of the most respected
chefs in the world

03:03.808 --> 03:06.561
are using social media to get
people excited about their food.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.064
In my experience,
the dishes that go viral

03:09.105 --> 03:13.068
are quick, easy,
aesthetically pleasing, and fun.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.362
For today's quickfire challenge,
we want you to create

03:15.403 --> 03:19.616
an original dish that you think
can go viral, and we want you

03:19.657 --> 03:22.410
to have a little fun and
create a video to go with it.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.371
- This is our challenge!
- We do this!

03:24.412 --> 03:25.872
You're confident!

03:26.623 --> 03:29.084
When I'm cooking,
I cannot talk to the camera.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.544
I don't like the camera
being in my face when I cook.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.338
- That's just--
- You know, you're on

03:33.380 --> 03:35.507
- a TV show, right?
- I know.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.509
It's so bad.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
The quickfire winner
will get immunity

03:39.344 --> 03:41.346
in the next
elimination challenge.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.640
And also,
I'm going to be posting

03:43.682 --> 03:46.351
about the winner
on my social media.

03:46.393 --> 03:50.188
[applause]

03:50.230 --> 03:53.066
Five million followers.
That's a lot of eyes.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.944
You have one hour to
create your dish and a video.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.447
Use your time wisely
and don't forget to have fun.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.949
Your time starts...

04:00.990 --> 04:02.701
now.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.371
We're going viral!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.789
We're going to do
a peanut butter

04:07.831 --> 04:09.207
and jelly sandwich, right?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.625
- What?
- Listen.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.669
Lava cake,
so I'm going to go start

04:12.711 --> 04:13.962
getting the ingredients
for that.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.797
- Chicken tikka masala.
- Pizza?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.466
Yes. Best pizza in the world.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.927
We're going to make
a microwave lava cake.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.972
To make a dish go viral,
it needs to be simple.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.726
We're going to make five
ingredient microwave lava cake.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.145
- What are you making?
- Lava cake.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.813
Oh, okay.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.149
Ocean and Jaydene are huge
competitors in this competition.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.361
However, Eva and I are far more
diversified as a competitor.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.072
They tend to stay
in the Hawaiian lane

04:41.114 --> 04:42.824
and what they know best.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.410
I thought I can make caramel and
then put it in a squeeze bottle.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.162
You could do that.

04:47.203 --> 04:51.499
I've got us some sugar,
graham crackers, marshmallow,

04:51.541 --> 04:53.626
so we're going to
make a s'mores bomb.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.962
I'm pretty big on
social media for cooking.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.131
I posted
this beef wellington I made,

04:58.173 --> 05:01.593
and it went semi-viral,
two and a half million views.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.178
What I want to do,
really when I'm older

05:03.219 --> 05:05.221
is I'd love to be like
Anthony Bourdain style.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.391
I want to travel the world
and eat delicious food.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.268
- Chocolate, chocolate!
- 'Course we need chocolate!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.729
S'mores, I think will
do well on social media.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.148
It's a fun activity,
something that I think

05:15.190 --> 05:16.274
everyone will wanna eat.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.859
Very important scientific taste.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.862
It's good. We're good..

05:20.904 --> 05:24.866
I hope this works.
We've never done this before.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.451
Everyone loves onion rings.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.036
Everyone
loves mozzarella sticks.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.205
So I'm gonna combine
two forces that are amazing.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.873
Mozzarella stuffed onion rings.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.792
- [chopping sounds]
- It's breaking apart.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.752
- You got to have it tighter.
- Yeah.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.462
Having the more cheese in there

05:37.504 --> 05:39.047
makes it a little harder
to work with.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.466
Try this one.
Don't get stressed out.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.551
The Danish-inspired hot dog.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.553
Made out of a carrot.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.555
I just think
carrot for some reason.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.599
And you can make a carrot
look like a hot dog.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.975
We're going to marionette it,

05:51.017 --> 05:52.560
and then we're going
to grill it.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.104
I think the
carrot dog is brilliant.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.106
We're can do
crispy red onion, too.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.899
- You want to deep fry it?
- Yeah.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.694
We're kind of learning how
to work together better.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654
At the end of the day,
we're getting kind of

06:02.696 --> 06:04.406
better ideas
as a result of that.

06:04.447 --> 06:08.034
We go to Denmark every summer
and we get hot dogs there.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.537
My mom is from Denmark
and I have dual citizenship.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.789
I can travel freely
anywhere in the EU

06:12.831 --> 06:15.792
or to the U.K, Norway, Sweden.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.836
It does kind of play
into my cooking style.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.421
That's a better size, huh?

06:19.462 --> 06:22.090
- It's looking more hot doggy.
- 30 minutes left!

06:22.132 --> 06:24.384
Peanut butter and jelly
sandwich in a cereal.

06:24.426 --> 06:29.389
If pancake cereal can go viral,
my cereal can go viral too.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.974
I'm not going to lie.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.018
I'm completely out of my
comfort zone with this one.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.602
I don't make
cooking videos at home.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.229
I'm an old school guy.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.106
This is so, so strange.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.774
I'm leaning on you, kid.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.693
We're going to do peanut
butter and jelly cereal.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.361
Little peanut butter
cookie as your cereal

06:43.403 --> 06:46.906
and strawberry milk
as the jelly component.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.826
So how long these need to sit in
the oven before they get crispy?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.495
- Ten minutes.
- This better work.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.205
It looks like
it worked, bud.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.832
So I'm going
to get started on these.

06:55.874 --> 07:00.045
Those look good! Celebrate!

07:00.670 --> 07:02.339
Have you seen
Jessica Woo's videos before?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.216
I have. I actually
watched her videos a lot.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.636
If she posts a video of us,
that'd be amazing.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.265
15 minutes! Don't forget
your videos, people.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.600
Hello.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.979
Okay. You don't want
to taste it once?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.398
- Really?
- I'm very confident.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.401
Let me check my hair real quick.
Can you move your arm?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.987
I don't usually like doing
videos, but if you're going

07:26.029 --> 07:28.073
to give me a challenge and
you're going to challenge me

07:28.114 --> 07:29.783
to make a video,
I'm going to give you

07:29.824 --> 07:31.368
the best video that I can.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.577
What's up, guys?
It's Ocean here.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.162
And Jaydene.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.789
We are making some
tropical lava cakes

07:35.830 --> 07:38.333
in the <i>Top Chef Family Style</i>
kitchen.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.211
He's like so full of
personality right now

07:41.252 --> 07:43.672
that I don't
even know who he is.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.840
Let me show the camera how we--

07:45.882 --> 07:47.425
Just push me out of the way.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.928
- Hi, my name is Delilah.
- Hi, and I'm Danny.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.931
- And today we're making--
- [both] Some cereal churros.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.100
So first we're going
to put in the apple cereal.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.227
Okay, Mom,
we have to do a video now.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.855
Other teams have a lot
of social media but I don't.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.191
Probably until she's 13.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.277
Hi, guys, this is Anika
and Anika--

08:07.696 --> 08:09.823
So you gotta help me out.
I can't do this.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.200
This is the least
of your worries.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.369
What makes a good video
is like the person

08:14.411 --> 08:16.538
who's in it is like outgoing.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.874
I've been home schooled almost
my whole life, so I'm more shy.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.711
Like, just look at the food,
don't look at me.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.879
So I'm back,
hey, hey, guys, what?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.090
“Hey, it's Kennedy and Rosie!”

08:27.132 --> 08:30.176
Being a radio DJ,
videos don't bother me,

08:30.218 --> 08:32.012
so I'm excited
about this challenge,

08:32.053 --> 08:33.638
I'm like, we totally got this.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.141
- One, two, three.
- Help me out.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.351
I don't think my video
is going to be very good.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.895
Ten minutes!

08:40.937 --> 08:44.774
Oh, no! The top one burned.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.735
What can we do, Dad?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.236
I don't know.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.447
We're going to have to
figure something out.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.990
What are you doing?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.951
We might not even get
anything on the plate.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.003
Hot churros!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.963
- What can we do, Dad?
- I don't know.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.215
So I put the peanut butter
cereal in the oven

09:09.257 --> 09:11.426
and they come out burnt.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.471
What are we supposed to do?
How do we change our whole idea?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.890
- What are you doing?
- We're going to have to pivot.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.185
- I think a no bake cheesecake.
- So what are you doing now?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.771
Get a ramekin, please.
I grab Mascarpone cheese.

09:22.812 --> 09:27.317
I add vanilla and sugar, whisk,
whisk, whisk. We got this.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.569
Make a video about
a dish going wrong.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.489
All right,
I have all the toppings ready.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.699
Alright, chefs,
you have one minute left!

09:34.741 --> 09:36.618
The chaos will be viral.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.620
- Looking good.
- I've got to get the sauce on.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.289
- Looks like a hot dog.
- Why'd you make these so big?

09:41.956 --> 09:46.002
Eight, seven, six, five,

09:46.044 --> 09:49.756
four, three, two, one.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.424
Time's up, hands up.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.886
We got something on the plate.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.262
I don't
want to do that one again.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.972
- Ever again.
- No.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.934
Hi!

10:00.975 --> 10:02.727
Jack. Can you tell us
about your dish?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.312
So we did a mozza-ring.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.272
It's two pieces of onion
and then you stuff it

10:06.314 --> 10:08.191
with the mozzarella stick.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.360
So cool.
Perfect combo, right?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.487
- Can we see your video?
- Yeah.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.572
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>so it's done frying.</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:18.118
<i>I got my mozzarella stick</i>
<i>onion ring here looking good.</i>

10:18.910 --> 10:21.121
- I tried.
- Amazing!

10:21.162 --> 10:22.997
- Great job.
- Thank you, Jack and Bobbie.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.793
- Khalil and Willie, what's up?
- We made what we call

10:26.835 --> 10:28.795
"The 22 Second
No-Bake Cheesecake,"

10:28.837 --> 10:31.297
because we kind of
had a big hiccup

10:31.339 --> 10:33.883
and we didn't have anything
to put on the plate.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.343
So we rushed.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.470
<i>- 30 seconds.</i>
<i>- 30 seconds.</i>

10:39.097 --> 10:40.849
That's the stuff
that goes viral, by the way.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.017
That last minute stuff.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.309
Ingenuity at its finest.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.520
Right.
Great job.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.939
Delilah and Danny.
This looks pretty viral.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.233
We decided to make
some cereal churros,

10:50.275 --> 10:52.152
but three different kinds
because we wanted

10:52.193 --> 10:54.612
to tell everyone that you
could do it with any cereal.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.948
We also drizzled
some white chocolate,

10:56.990 --> 10:59.159
so it would
kind of look like milk.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.869
<i>- Hi, I'm Danny.</i>
<i>- And I'm Delilah.</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:05.373
<i>- We made cereal churros.</i>
- So cute. Love it!

11:05.415 --> 11:08.251
I love that you provided
three different options too.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
- It's so good.
- Milan and Chandrani.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.132
Today we've got s'mores in
the oven that anyone can make,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.468
- including you, Meghan.
- Okay, amazing.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.722
<i>Graham cracker,</i>
<i>butter, sugar, mix.</i>

11:20.764 --> 11:24.851
<i>Chocolate, marshmallow,</i>
<i>bake and enjoy.</i>

11:24.893 --> 11:27.687
And you got chocolate
chips and marshmallows in yours.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.314
They're in there as well.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.275
- This is just the process.
-That's the process.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.444
As you guys know we're
the kids from Hawaii.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.863
So inspiration of that
we made for you guys today,

11:36.905 --> 11:38.365
some lava cakes.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.367
You think I can make this?

11:40.408 --> 11:43.745
This is just a few ingredients
and 14 minutes in the oven.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.497
<i>Are we talking already?</i>

11:45.538 --> 11:47.916
<i>We can walk them through</i>
<i>what we're doing with this.</i>

11:47.957 --> 11:49.626
<i>Just like back home.</i>

11:49.668 --> 11:51.795
There's some berry
compote on the side.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.798
And we did a passion
fruit whipped cream with it.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.549
Great job.
Thank you so much.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.177
- Can we watch your video?
- Oh yeah, I guess.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.096
<i>We made our take on</i>
<i>elevated grilled cheese</i>

12:01.137 --> 12:02.889
<i>with bacon and green apples.</i>

12:02.931 --> 12:05.975
<i>Raspberry, horseradish</i>
<i>and the cheese we used was...</i>

12:06.017 --> 12:08.770
<i>- Pepper Jack cheese.</i>
<i>- Pepper Jack cheese.</i>

12:08.812 --> 12:10.855
Oh my God, so cute.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.775
I've never had apples
in a grilled cheese.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.820
My dad introduced me
to it a few years ago.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.904
- It's good.
- Thank you.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.322
Thank you so much.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.741
Hi Kaj and Liz, what's up,
what's up?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.618
This is our "hot dog."

12:23.660 --> 12:25.745
<i>This is our quick and easy hack</i>
<i>to make a hot dog.</i>

12:25.787 --> 12:27.706
<i>All you need is a plastic</i>
<i>bag and microwave.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:29.749
<i>And a carrot, you need a carrot.</i>

12:29.791 --> 12:31.334
Look at you.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.712
So it's a
carrot dog is what it is.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.589
We topped it with some
crispy onions, pickle.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.259
- It's so good.
- Yes, carrot dogs.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.136
- That's so clever.
- Yeah.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.805
A five ingredient
microwave lava cake

12:43.847 --> 12:45.640
with homemade chocolate ganache

12:45.682 --> 12:47.767
and garnished with a strawberry,
chocolate straw,

12:47.809 --> 12:49.436
and powdered sugar.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.271
- Okay, let's watch your video.
- It's embarrassing.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.107
<i>So we're making a</i>
<i>microwave lava cake.</i>

12:54.149 --> 12:57.944
<i>- Slapping, slapping.</i>
-Love it!

12:57.986 --> 13:00.780
- Love this. Great video.
- Thank you.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.450
Anika, can you tell us
what you made for us?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.161
We made chicken tikka
masala pizza.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.787
We really thought it'd go viral.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.664
So smart.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.625
<i>It's a really great pizza.</i>
<i>We hope you like it and--</i>

13:14.419 --> 13:16.838
I love the video,
the vulnerability.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.174
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.719
Before we announce
our favorites,

13:22.761 --> 13:24.304
do you have any advice
for the dishes

13:24.346 --> 13:25.930
that didn't grab our attention?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.432
Milan and Chandrani.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.643
The idea of the s'mores
bomb was exciting,

13:30.685 --> 13:34.064
but the execution
was not as exciting.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.815
Eva and Jenn, I'm so sorry.

13:35.857 --> 13:40.195
We loved the lava cake,
but it just wasn't as creative.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.239
Ocean and Jaydene,
it tasted amazing,

13:43.281 --> 13:45.867
but I think it was just
a little bit too fancy

13:45.909 --> 13:48.912
- for someone at home to make--
- It was intimidating.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.748
Jessica, who made our
favourite dishes today?

13:51.790 --> 13:54.959
Delilah and Danny,
we loved those churros.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.171
Anyone could make them,
and they're fun and exciting.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.422
Thank you.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.383
Kaj and Liz. The carrot dog.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.552
It was so creative,
and it was also simple to make.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.389
Jack and Bobbie.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.102
We just love that it was
two simple things put together,

14:12.143 --> 14:13.687
but it's,
you know, innovative.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.815
I've never seen an onion
ring in a mozzarella stick form.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.026
Who won
this quickfire challenge?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.528
The winner of this challenge

14:21.569 --> 14:25.240
made it easy to execute
and really unique.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.037
Kaj and Liz.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.206
Yeah! Sweet!

14:33.873 --> 14:35.792
Yay Kaj and Liz!

14:35.834 --> 14:37.293
Back to back wins.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.295
- Feels pretty good.
- Immunity is awesome.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.506
Now that we're learning
more about each other

14:41.548 --> 14:43.633
and how we cook,
I feel like we can really

14:43.675 --> 14:45.885
be contenders
for this competition.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.556
You now have immunity
in the elimination challenge.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.183
And Jessica's going to
post about your recipe,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.727
so get ready to blow up.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.228
Awesome!

14:55.270 --> 14:57.564
A round of
applause for Jessica Woo!

14:57.605 --> 15:00.608
[applause]

15:01.401 --> 15:04.362
Another quick fire challenge
down.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.867
***

15:08.908 --> 15:11.786
Please welcome back our head
judge Marcus Samuelsson

15:11.828 --> 15:14.831
and guest judge
Michael Cimarusti.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.541
[applause]

15:16.583 --> 15:18.626
- Hey, guys.
- Howdy.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.129
- Are you so excited?
- I see a fish.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.676
Michael is a James Beard
award winner and his restaurant,

15:26.718 --> 15:30.263
"Providence" here in L.A.
has two Michelin stars.

15:30.305 --> 15:34.142
Michael is also a leader in the
Sustainable Seafood Movement.

15:35.143 --> 15:38.438
On this table, we have all
sorts of sustainable seafood,

15:38.480 --> 15:41.066
grassy bar oysters,
mussels, spot prawn.

15:41.107 --> 15:44.361
And then we have what
you might call trash fish.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.281
They're not the salmon
and the tuna of the world.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.116
I don't consider them trash.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.785
I consider
them underappreciated.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.371
As chefs, it's important
for us to utilize everything

15:54.412 --> 15:56.790
we can from the water,
but also everything

15:56.831 --> 16:00.168
on the fish
to be part of the solution.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.462
For this elimination challenge,

16:02.504 --> 16:05.215
you'll be splitting
into three teams.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.969
Team challenge. Finally.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.429
A team challenge!

16:11.471 --> 16:13.098
I'm feeling really
excited working in a team

16:13.139 --> 16:14.641
other than my mom.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.142
Sorry, Mom.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.727
It's a team challenge.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.146
Someone can go home for
someone else's fault,

16:20.188 --> 16:21.690
and I don't like that.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.777
Each team must serve
three courses

16:25.819 --> 16:28.363
highlighting
sustainable seafood.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.825
Mollusks, crustacean,
and trash fish.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.662
You'll serve your dishes
at a special tribute dinner

16:35.704 --> 16:39.124
honoring 15
chefs and volunteers

16:39.165 --> 16:42.043
on the frontlines of the
Sustainable Seafood Movement.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.671
So tonight you'll menu plan
with your teams,

16:44.713 --> 16:46.631
and tomorrow
you'll have one hour

16:46.673 --> 16:48.842
to prep and cook
before service begins.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.887
Each chef pair will be
responsible for one course,

16:52.929 --> 16:57.017
but you must work as a team
in order to get your dishes out,

16:57.058 --> 16:59.686
and the winning team
will be safe from going home.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.021
Ooh!

17:01.062 --> 17:03.773
Okay, chefs,
please pull a fish spatula

17:03.815 --> 17:06.234
to determine
who your teammates will be.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.611
Green, okay.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.863
Blue.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.865
Coral.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.908
Nice. Three different teams
so far!

17:14.909 --> 17:16.077
Green!

17:16.953 --> 17:19.914
- Blue.
- Team blue for Ocean.

17:19.956 --> 17:22.042
- Blue.
- Yay!

17:22.083 --> 17:23.460
I'm really happy with our team.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.045
We're from Houston.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.881
You got the ocean there.
You got Ocean by the ocean.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.383
Kennedy and Rosie in Alaska.
This is perfect.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.010
Dream team.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.471
Team Green. Okay.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.640
Yeah, coral.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.018
Another coral.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.439
I'm excited
about Danny and Delilah.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.942
Anika and Anu haven't
risen to the top yet.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.071
So I might have a
little bit of a concern.

17:51.112 --> 17:54.407
Chefs, it's time
to sink or swim.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.743
Your menu planning starts now.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.578
- 15 minutes.
- Run!

17:58.620 --> 18:01.414
You're not competing
against each other now.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.375
I honestly want to
call dibs on the clams.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.503
- I kind of want to do a clam--
- But we want to do clams.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.755
- I'm not confident in shrimp.
- Neither am I.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.049
We're not doing shrimp.
We've already done shrimp.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.842
I think we're really
comfortable with fish.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.469
So that's what we want to do.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.137
Well, we're
comfortable with fish too.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.598
- I really want to do shrimp.
- Okay, cool.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.642
- You want to do shrimp?
- We'll do fish.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.061
That is exactly what
I work with at home.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.646
I was invited to be on

18:24.688 --> 18:26.189
the Hawaii Sustainable
Seafood Council,

18:26.231 --> 18:28.942
so my job is to take
these lesser known fish

18:28.983 --> 18:30.860
and give them
a name for themselves.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.821
This is, like, his one thing.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.614
If you guys want fish,
I'm good with that.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.784
- I like mussels.
- Good with you guys doing that.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.911
We're thinking
blue shrimp dumplings.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.081
New Orleans stayer
charbroiled oyster.

18:43.832 --> 18:48.128
Banana leaf wrapped fish
is one of the big ones we had.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.464
Maybe you guys can figure
something out with shrimp.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.843
We can't do it again. Feeling
a bit irritated at this moment.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.220
This is a team challenge,
but in the end,

18:57.262 --> 18:59.222
only one duo is being sent home.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.266
I don't want it to be
turning into a fight.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.893
Let's just take shrimp
if that's what it is.

19:03.935 --> 19:08.064
But no. This
is something that I can do.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.275
I am always
the one who compromises.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.986
I'm really impressed
Anika is standing her ground.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.821
We can do the fish.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.740
But they're looking
for teamwork too.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.950
Can you guys do that then?

19:18.992 --> 19:20.994
It's fine. You know what,
we'll do the shrimp.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.414
We’ll do the shrimp.
We'll do the shrimp.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.834
Because we're chefs and
we will rise to the occasion.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.920
Have to think about what
we're going to do. We need time.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.882
- We'll, move out of our lane.
- Oh my God.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.886
we'll do whatever
we have to do to make it work.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.014
***

19:49.606 --> 19:51.649
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.651
Cute aprons.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.362
All right.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.322
All right, guys, so we
thought about it overnight.

19:57.364 --> 20:01.534
We're going to be doing
a Louisiana Creole shrimp

20:01.576 --> 20:03.495
over creamy polenta.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.999
Us being open minded chefs,
we take the shrimp

20:08.041 --> 20:11.670
because we're good teammates and
we haven't used shrimp before

20:11.711 --> 20:13.672
- in this competition.
- Okay, let's go!

20:15.215 --> 20:17.884
I'm just
on oyster shucking detail.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.678
If you could grab me
quarter sheet trays

20:19.719 --> 20:21.554
- and the ice cream salts.
- Yeah, of course.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.223
For today's
elimination challenge,

20:23.264 --> 20:24.933
Kaj and Liz are going
to take the mollusks.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.976
They're going to make
oysters two ways.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.270
Jack and Bobbie are going
to make shrimp three ways,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.189
and we're going
to use banana leaf

20:31.231 --> 20:33.983
to wrap a mustard fish
so that it steams really nicely

20:34.025 --> 20:36.152
and also has
some very unique flavors

20:36.194 --> 20:38.488
that I don't think the judges
will be used to at all.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.657
***

20:41.282 --> 20:42.742
Oh, my gosh,
they have green ones.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.744
We have blue ones. That's cool.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.621
My day job back home
is a creative director

20:46.663 --> 20:48.206
- and brand manager.
- We have a plan.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.667
Need something?
Just yell, we'll knock it out.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.918
My job and a competition
actually have

20:51.960 --> 20:53.378
a lot of things
in common.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.046
You know,
within my job leading a team,

20:55.088 --> 20:56.881
I have to be able
to delegate things.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.883
And in this challenge,
I got to do the same thing.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.011
When I say Blue team,
you say cook.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.637
- Blue team.
- Cook!

21:02.679 --> 21:03.972
- Blue team.
- Cook!

21:04.014 --> 21:05.932
That was like so awesome.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.101
Menu planning actually,
is going really good right now.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.228
Khalil and Willie
are making mussel

21:10.270 --> 21:12.230
and Kennedy and Rosie
are doing chowder,

21:12.272 --> 21:14.482
and we're making
a crispy skin rockfish

21:14.524 --> 21:15.942
with a rockfish dumpling.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.861
And shiitake mushroom dashi.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.363
I got to get
this thing fully scaled

21:20.405 --> 21:23.199
before you take off the head,
take out the guts.

21:23.241 --> 21:26.077
You don't want any of the scales
or anything to touch the meat.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.246
It's going to make it a
little bit fishier.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.582
Whenever I catch a fish,
I'm in charge of cleaning it.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.959
I'm really excited because
I love filleting fish.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.753
It's like-- it's almost
like a hobby for me,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.379
something that's calming.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.883
- That's not a normal hobby.
- I know it's weird.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.676
- You're already done?
- I'm done.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.762
Oh my gosh.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.138
I think that Ocean
and Jaydene

21:45.180 --> 21:46.973
are going to win this
competition.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.767
Whenever they get critiqued,
it's like,

21:48.808 --> 21:50.393
“Oh, your dish was too fancy."

21:50.435 --> 21:52.312
And I was like,
that's not really a critique.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.147
Like, their dishes
are always so good.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.191
It's gonna turn a little
bit melty for the fish heads.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.984
But, I think it's
gonna give more flavor.

21:58.026 --> 22:01.237
- Oh my god, that's so gross.
- Umami!

22:02.155 --> 22:06.785
We usually kind of do
like Mexican kind of food,

22:06.826 --> 22:09.120
so we wanted to kind
of go out of our box.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.165
We are all out of our comfort
zones working with other people,

22:12.207 --> 22:15.085
but I think we have
a solid menu for today.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.253
Bloody stuff coming through.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.215
Anika and Anu are making
a seared black cod

22:20.256 --> 22:22.967
with asparagus and a
Jerusalem artichoke puree.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.928
Give me the shrimp.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.306
Eva and Jenn are working
on a Cajun shrimp polenta.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.643
And we decided we're
making a clam miso soup

22:31.685 --> 22:33.353
with our own little twist on it.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.690
Like always, we still
want to get that Latin flair.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.108
I mean...

22:38.149 --> 22:39.776
I mean,
that's the day in the life.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.236
That's what we do.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.987
Did you guys taste
this on the chili oil?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.906
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.827
I can't feel any more pin bones

22:48.868 --> 22:50.286
but I might be wrong.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.372
I've taken a couple
of classes before

22:52.414 --> 22:54.916
in filleting fish so I
really know how to do it.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.836
A lot of people think
that because my mom

22:57.877 --> 22:59.921
is plant based,
they think that everyone

22:59.963 --> 23:02.007
in my family doesn't
know how to cook meat.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.842
That's totally not true.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.428
Everyone,
except my mom is carnivorous.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.180
Mom, I need a plate,
can you please get me a plate?

23:09.222 --> 23:12.225
- Okay, sorry.
- 30 minutes!

23:13.560 --> 23:15.311
How are y'all doing on time?

23:15.353 --> 23:17.939
We're doing well, if you guys
need help, know that we're here.

23:17.981 --> 23:21.067
I love our team.
It's so happy and helpful.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.028
I feel like Green Team
is a strong team.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.988
- Okay, I can help.
- It's amazing because--

23:25.905 --> 23:27.699
- Tell me what I should do.
-Devein.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.200
Make things go faster.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.202
We still gotta wrap these.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.705
I'm doing shrimp three ways and
I'm going to Jackify the shrimp.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.248
Obviously, it's me.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.876
So this is going
to be interesting.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.627
It's a big risk doing this dish.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.422
We have to execute all three
of our components perfectly.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.591
It wouldn't be Jack
if it wasn't a risk.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.552
I never thought
I'd be in a <i>Top Chef</i>kitchen

23:47.594 --> 23:50.096
- ripping off shrimp heads.
- That's true.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.266
What's that?

23:53.308 --> 23:56.561
Thai green chiles
with some mustard powder.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.229
The inspiration for this dish

23:58.271 --> 24:00.273
is the classic Bengali
mustard fish.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.108
We've had it
in Calcutta before.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.695
I really feel this pride
in bringing this dish

24:05.737 --> 24:07.072
to a wider audience.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.615
Should we cut
the skin off these?

24:08.656 --> 24:10.283
Uh, no.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.870
Once the miso's in there,
it's going to give it a salty--

24:13.912 --> 24:15.246
We're going to add that
towards the end

24:15.288 --> 24:16.915
so the miso doesn't overcook.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.792
Yeah, we're just waiting
for this to reduce.

24:19.918 --> 24:22.379
I have a very fine
palette and know

24:22.420 --> 24:25.423
what things generally need
to taste like.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.967
Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.844
So if someone's weak
at something and someone

24:29.886 --> 24:32.681
on your team is strong at that,
they can always just help out.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.266
Some more clam sauce, I think,
in that juice.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.477
Do you want me to
add the miso right now?

24:40.355 --> 24:42.065
Hi, everyone.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.859
- Hi.
- So pretty.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.112
Oh, I look perfect for this.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.655
Look how gorgeous this is.

24:49.572 --> 24:52.283
Claudette and Michael, thank
you so much for joining us.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.993
You can teach me a lot today.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.162
We'll take the first bite
and then you can follow.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.455
Yes.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.290
It's going to be
a three course meal.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.126
It's all about sustainability

25:01.167 --> 25:03.128
and underappreciated seafood,
which I know

25:03.169 --> 25:04.629
that's something that you're
very passionate about.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.548
Absolutely. For me,
that's really important

25:06.589 --> 25:08.341
to pass on to the next
generation.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.677
Take care of the water
and the animals in it.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.804
And full utilization
of a product. Always.

25:12.846 --> 25:16.141
- One minute. Come on, Dad.
- Some of the yellow ones.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.934
Yeah. It's a lot to do.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.602
I need a big spoon.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.688
We have like a minute left,

25:21.730 --> 25:24.566
and Jenn decides to add a little
bit of the broth

25:24.607 --> 25:27.986
from the steaming liquid
to the top of the soup.

25:28.028 --> 25:31.948
It's a little bit too late
to discuss it with everybody.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.324
Don't put too much.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.952
Teamwork makes the dream work.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.371
She just added it in
without telling us,

25:38.413 --> 25:41.041
so I hope it doesn't
ruin the flavors.

25:41.082 --> 25:44.377
Three, two, one.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.545
Hands up!

25:45.587 --> 25:46.921
Let's go. Let's go.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.132
Woo.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.389
- Nice!
- Wow. Look at that.

25:56.431 --> 25:59.351
Oh my goodness,
we're in the ocean.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.561
- Kaj and Liz.
- We have oysters two ways.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.480
A fresh oyster
with a lemongrass

26:03.521 --> 26:05.440
and green apple mignonette.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.525
And New Orleans style
charbroiled oysters

26:07.567 --> 26:10.570
with hot sauce,
Parmesan, and garlic butter.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.573
That's amazing.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.950
Khalil and Willie.

26:15.992 --> 26:19.287
We made steamed mussels
with a spicy Aji Amarillo

26:19.329 --> 26:21.581
and oyster mushroom broth.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.166
Mm. Wow.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.709
Delilah and Danny.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.212
So we made kind of
like a clam miso soup.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.422
But we wanted to put
our own little twist

26:29.464 --> 26:32.008
and put some of
our Latin flair on it.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.260
- Oh my God.
- That's amazing.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.262
- So good.
- All right.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.181
- Thank you all so much, chefs.
- Great job.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.225
- Thank you, chefs.
- Thank you.

26:42.227 --> 26:45.355
I think Kaj and Liz's
oyster is amazing.

26:45.397 --> 26:47.899
It's always a challenge,
serving two different things

26:47.941 --> 26:49.526
because you're just naturally
going to lean

26:49.567 --> 26:51.444
to liking one
more than the other.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.863
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

26:53.905 --> 26:56.533
I'm very impressed with Willie
and Khalil on this.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.868
I can see their personalities
are spicy, they're funky.

26:58.910 --> 27:02.914
It's got the love
and the passion. The story.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.207
Went pretty good.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.583
They liked it apparently.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.586
What Delilah and Danny did is,
you know,

27:08.628 --> 27:10.922
- pretty near perfect I think.
- This is one of those broths

27:10.964 --> 27:12.924
that tastes like it'll bring
you back to life.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.217
Agree with that.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.677
<i>Levante muertos.</i>
"Raise the dead."

27:15.719 --> 27:17.178
Wow.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.888
I wanted
to take a bath in the broth.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.306
Just kidding.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.351
- How's the shrimp going?
- Amazing.

27:23.393 --> 27:26.354
Awesome. This polenta
is almost done.

27:26.396 --> 27:27.897
We got five minutes, guys.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.108
The polenta is done?
Move it off.

27:30.150 --> 27:33.111
The sauce, the sauce.
You need to put the sauce on.

27:33.153 --> 27:34.779
Holy crap, that's good.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.281
Kaj, reduction.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.824
Kind of sick, you know?

27:37.866 --> 27:40.035
Well, we were just going
to dot it like across.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.494
Let's do that.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.329
Want me to
put the shrimp on there?

27:43.371 --> 27:44.956
Can you hold this? Hold it!

27:44.998 --> 27:47.792
It's pretty intense
standing up to Eva and Jenn.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.712
The way they communicate
is by yelling.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.213
Hold it straight!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.591
I don't think it's an
effective way of communicating.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.552
I am deeply
concerned with the sauce.

27:57.594 --> 28:01.765
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.684
Great dish, guys.

28:05.143 --> 28:07.896
- Wow.
- Thank you.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.731
Oh, it's cut in half.
Isn't that cute?

28:09.773 --> 28:10.899
What is?

28:10.940 --> 28:13.193
There's the head
and there's the butt.

28:14.194 --> 28:15.779
Jack and Bobbie.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.989
We did shrimp three ways,
so we have a shrimp head

28:18.031 --> 28:20.075
fried in cornstarch
and a soy reduction

28:20.116 --> 28:23.370
with a shrimp dumpling
and then grilled shrimp

28:23.411 --> 28:25.372
with ginger, some garlic.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.166
You just ate that head
like that?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.501
Oh yeah.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.211
Kennedy and Rosie.

28:31.252 --> 28:35.048
We made a crab chowder and
we also add purple potatoes

28:35.090 --> 28:37.342
into our chowder just
because that's what we use

28:37.384 --> 28:39.219
at home because we
grow our own garden.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.513
Eva and Jenn.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.015
We made
a Louisiana shrimp creole

28:44.057 --> 28:45.934
over a bed of creamy polenta.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.353
And I assume
just to be consistent,

28:48.395 --> 28:50.146
it was loud and it was
a little screaming?

28:50.188 --> 28:52.190
- Oh 100%.
- Okay, good.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.566
Always and forever.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.735
Thank you so much, chefs.

28:58.655 --> 29:00.865
Jack and Bobbie,
the sweet soy,

29:00.907 --> 29:04.869
they reduced the complex,
caramelized and to present

29:04.911 --> 29:08.415
the head, the shrimp,
and the dumplings.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.875
So many details that
it's hard to execute.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.712
The one bite that I really
enjoyed on that was the head,

29:13.753 --> 29:15.797
so good.
I think Meghan would love it.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.257
Ugh, okay.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.552
It's just like a shrimp
flavored French fry.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.013
Bit crunchy. You got it.

29:23.054 --> 29:26.808
- There you go. See? Right?
- Oh! Oh!

29:26.850 --> 29:29.019
I like the head
better than the butt.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.396
Do you guys need anything
chopped or anything?

29:31.438 --> 29:33.940
Kennedy and Rosie, I think they
made the most of the product.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.859
The soup tastes of crab.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.069
It's delicious.
Perfect consistency for me.

29:38.111 --> 29:41.239
Not a super progressive dish,
but they know what they know

29:41.281 --> 29:42.657
and they executed well.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.784
You cook with a lot
of fish back home?

29:44.826 --> 29:46.453
A lot of salmon.

29:46.494 --> 29:47.996
Eva and Jenn.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.664
They always make this
fancy food for me,

29:49.706 --> 29:51.916
but they make it taste
like comfort food.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.752
I think they executed really,
really well.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.378
The polenta is beautiful,
creamy.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.880
They could have a little
bit more acid

29:56.921 --> 29:58.757
to make the dish a tad lighter.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.759
This was beautiful.
Simple.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.927
I could have licked the plate,
but I didn't do it

30:02.969 --> 30:05.430
because he might get mad.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.807
- Oh, my God.
- One dish left.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.477
How are you
guys feeling about time?

30:10.518 --> 30:12.354
Not great.
Enough to wrap them.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.773
These banana leaves
are really stiff.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.609
We have to really work
on making them pliable

30:17.650 --> 30:19.903
so that they
actually bend and wrap.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.238
Don't forget the lemon.
Don't forget the lemon.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.948
I'm a little stressed.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.951
We have to put the paste on,
add the rice, wrap the fish,

30:26.993 --> 30:30.580
cook the fish, but we've got
everyone working on it together.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.956
Okay, so that
one's going 330.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.750
That one's
coming out in one minute.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.252
This is looking very thick.
I'm happy with it.

30:36.294 --> 30:40.632
My white wine pan sauce that
goes on the black cod is great.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.884
Okay, taste this.
It's very buttery.

30:43.927 --> 30:45.428
We need spoons.

30:46.012 --> 30:49.849
- This is too thick.
- Turn on the heat.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.726
You wanna baste these
or what do you think?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.645
- Sure. Let's do that.
- For one minute.

30:53.687 --> 30:56.773
I'm sorry, but-- going in.

30:56.815 --> 31:00.527
Anika's sauce needs some help.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.279
So I take
matters into my own hands.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.824
I think it will go--
oh, hey, what'd you do?

31:05.865 --> 31:08.827
- Nothing.
- My sauce. It's more liquid-y,

31:08.868 --> 31:11.121
and it's not as emulsified
as it was before.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.498
Oh no. It melted--
the butter melted.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.001
I think it may be because
I turned the heat on

31:16.042 --> 31:17.877
and maybe the butter melted
or something.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.754
I'm not exactly sure
what happened.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.798
I'm feeling panicked.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.050
Oh, my God, it's way too sour.

31:30.181 --> 31:31.891
I just got
to make sure it's crispy.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.519
I need a little sauce.
Bring me sauce.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.564
Oh no, it split now.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.190
I added some wine.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.859
We didn't want wine.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.237
We already emulsified it
with butter. So now it's split.

31:44.279 --> 31:48.033
I'm really disappointed
because it's my sauce

31:48.074 --> 31:50.577
and Jenn put in
something without asking.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.495
I'm really not
feeling good about this.

31:52.537 --> 31:55.040
I am a bit nervous that
my sauce will be too liquid-y

31:55.081 --> 31:57.792
and it's broken and it
won't come together in the end.

31:59.336 --> 32:02.505
I'm going to put cream and
I'm going to put cornstarch in.

32:02.547 --> 32:04.341
No, you don't need cornstarch.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.925
You don't want it that thick.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.844
It was too thick
before I added wine.

32:07.886 --> 32:09.471
I mean, you need
a little more wine.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.930
No, no, no, no.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.682
We're going to do
the squish on the side

32:12.724 --> 32:14.851
so we need it to be thick.

32:18.521 --> 32:19.898
Two minutes.

32:24.402 --> 32:25.779
Hit it with some finishing salt.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.655
No, trust me,
that's salty enough.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.532
We're missing a piece of fish.

32:29.574 --> 32:30.867
No, that's 11 plates.

32:30.909 --> 32:35.872
Five, four, three, two, one.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.044
That was too intense.

32:44.714 --> 32:46.758
Oh, my goodness, look at that.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.301
That's gorgeous.

32:48.343 --> 32:50.261
Look at that.
That looks like an art piece.

32:50.303 --> 32:53.181
Third course, we're like
going out with a bang.

32:53.223 --> 32:55.266
Hello, chefs.
Milan and Chandrani.

32:55.308 --> 32:56.976
What did you make for us?

32:57.018 --> 32:59.688
Today, we have made for you
an iconic Bengali dish

32:59.729 --> 33:01.856
but we're presenting it
to you as a gift,

33:01.898 --> 33:03.525
a present from us to you.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.486
Our Bengali mustard fish
wrapped in banana leaf.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.321
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

33:08.363 --> 33:09.864
Ocean and Jaydene.

33:09.906 --> 33:12.242
Step up and tell us
what you made, Ocean.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.953
So today we got for you
guys a crispy skin rockfish

33:14.994 --> 33:16.788
with a rockfish dumpling.

33:16.830 --> 33:18.748
And a shiitake mushroom dashi.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.667
- Okay, thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

33:20.709 --> 33:23.878
Anika and Anu, will you
tell us what you made for us?

33:23.920 --> 33:26.297
So we made for you
crispy black cod

33:26.339 --> 33:29.175
with a Jerusalem artichoke,
or sunchoke, purée,

33:29.217 --> 33:32.721
white wine lemon caper butter
sauce and grilled asparagus.

33:32.762 --> 33:34.597
Okay, thank you so much, chefs.

33:34.639 --> 33:36.516
Thank you.

33:36.558 --> 33:39.185
The thing about Milan
and Chandrani's dish

33:39.227 --> 33:41.479
that I really love is that
that mustard chutney.

33:41.521 --> 33:43.440
Unfortunately, the fish
is a little undercooked.

33:43.481 --> 33:45.442
To cook something
like that in a parcel,

33:45.483 --> 33:48.111
you run that risk of maybe not
cooking it all the way.

33:48.153 --> 33:50.405
We did a great job working
as a team, I think.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.073
Great job, guys.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.867
Ocean and Jaydene's dish.

33:53.908 --> 33:56.202
I'm impressed that he can
put a crispy piece of fish

33:56.244 --> 33:59.247
right next to soup and
dumplings, and it stays crispy.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.666
This is incredible,
but I think actually

34:01.708 --> 34:05.754
the broth is a little bit,
you know, one noted for me.

34:05.795 --> 34:07.213
Fingers crossed.

34:07.255 --> 34:09.841
That by far
was my favorite challenge.

34:11.259 --> 34:14.220
I never saw this dish coming
from Anika and Anu.

34:14.262 --> 34:17.974
Almost a very French
traditional style of plate.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.351
The acid is
where it needs to be.

34:19.392 --> 34:21.478
The creaminess is
where it needs to be.

34:21.519 --> 34:24.022
This dish would be
a successful dish on <i>Top Chef,</i>

34:24.064 --> 34:26.441
but to see it coming
from a 14-year-old

34:26.483 --> 34:28.026
or a 13-year-old is insane.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.778
I'm gonna need
a birth certificate.

34:29.819 --> 34:31.404
I'm gonna need
a birth certificate.

34:31.446 --> 34:33.323
She might be a ringer.

34:33.365 --> 34:35.367
It was definitely
a little bit stressful.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.161
This is going
to be really tough.

34:38.203 --> 34:39.954
Some teams were better
than others, clearly,

34:39.996 --> 34:42.248
but everybody put together
a respectable menu,

34:42.290 --> 34:44.834
so that makes it really
difficult to choose someone

34:44.876 --> 34:46.586
to go home.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.339
It's different working
with one another

34:49.381 --> 34:52.008
because usually you're trying
to work against each other.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.927
Anika, you're a little
quiet over there.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.428
How was
the team challenge for you?

34:55.470 --> 34:57.972
It was good.
It was really tiring,

34:58.014 --> 35:01.184
but that's how
all challenges are, so...

35:01.226 --> 35:03.478
- Hello, chefs.
- Hello!

35:05.480 --> 35:08.191
We would like to see
all of you at judges table.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.694
Okay, everyone gets some
feedback.

35:10.735 --> 35:13.238
Thanks. Bye.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.282
All righty tighty.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.659
Let's go.

35:17.701 --> 35:21.162
***

35:30.547 --> 35:34.300
Today we saw some of the best
cooking that we've ever seen.

35:34.342 --> 35:38.054
You really took the challenge on
in terms of teamwork,

35:38.096 --> 35:40.849
but also you kept
your own personality,

35:40.890 --> 35:43.560
your own voice as a chef.

35:43.601 --> 35:48.732
Eva and Jenn, Anika and Anu,
Delilah and Danny.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.483
Can your team stay here

35:50.525 --> 35:52.777
and the rest of you may move
to the side.

35:55.530 --> 36:00.243
You chefs are standing
here because your team...

36:01.286 --> 36:03.288
made our favorite
dishes of the night.

36:03.621 --> 36:07.250
[applause]

36:07.292 --> 36:09.919
Team Coral! Woo!

36:09.961 --> 36:14.424
Eva and Jenn, the polenta was
really smooth in its texture.

36:14.466 --> 36:18.136
But then also the Creole sauce
folded in was super delicious.

36:18.178 --> 36:20.805
It's very aesthetically
pleasing to see a dish

36:20.847 --> 36:22.432
with those--
in that color palette.

36:22.474 --> 36:24.267
It was really beautiful
to look at and taste.

36:24.309 --> 36:25.894
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:25.935 --> 36:29.439
Anika and Anu,
subtle, beautiful choices

36:29.481 --> 36:32.692
like bringing the sunshine, but
also grilling that asparagus.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.987
It was not just a great
dish for a kid to create,

36:36.029 --> 36:38.156
but it was a great dish, period.

36:38.907 --> 36:40.617
Thank you.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.660
Delilah and Danny, how
did you come up with this idea?

36:42.702 --> 36:45.038
There's a traditional
Japanese clam miso soup,

36:45.080 --> 36:46.956
but we wanted to add our twist.

36:46.998 --> 36:48.458
You transported us.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.460
That's the cheapest
trip to Japan ever.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.629
- It was delicious.
- And the best one.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.881
And girlfriend, I see you.

36:54.923 --> 36:56.466
Yes, earrings!

36:56.508 --> 36:59.427
- Love the lobsters.
- Thank you.

36:59.469 --> 37:02.806
So the chefs that created
our favorite dish today

37:02.847 --> 37:05.892
took a humble piece of seafood

37:05.934 --> 37:09.104
and created
really world class food.

37:09.145 --> 37:11.106
And the winning chefs are...

37:11.147 --> 37:17.445
***

37:17.487 --> 37:19.572
Anika and Anu.

37:19.614 --> 37:23.284
[cheering]

37:23.326 --> 37:25.161
It feels great to
finally win a challenge.

37:25.203 --> 37:27.163
Yes Anika and Anu!

37:27.205 --> 37:29.165
It gives
not only us the validation,

37:29.207 --> 37:31.418
but everyone else that
we're not just the underdogs,

37:31.459 --> 37:33.336
we can do well
in this competition.

37:33.378 --> 37:35.505
It really has been a
rollercoaster for you two.

37:35.547 --> 37:37.007
How do you feel?

37:37.048 --> 37:38.717
This boosted up my confidence,

37:38.758 --> 37:43.638
but I just need to keep on going
and ride the rollercoaster.

37:44.556 --> 37:46.558
She's really,
really a great chef.

37:46.599 --> 37:50.020
I'm seeing that
if she's the leader, we're up.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.896
If I'm the leader,
then we are down.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.775
Congratulations
to the Coral Team.

37:55.817 --> 37:58.361
You may all step aside.

37:58.403 --> 38:01.448
Please, will the Blue Team
and the Green Team step forward.

38:05.201 --> 38:08.079
So your teams did not
win the challenge today,

38:08.788 --> 38:12.542
which means that one chef
pair here will be going home.

38:12.584 --> 38:17.422
***

38:21.551 --> 38:24.220
Green Team, tell us how it went
for you today.

38:24.262 --> 38:26.389
I think we worked well
as a team together.

38:26.431 --> 38:28.183
We all collaborated
on everyone's dishes

38:28.224 --> 38:29.893
and had some pretty
darn tasty ones too.

38:29.934 --> 38:32.896
Jack and Bobbie,
tell me about the shrimp dish.

38:32.937 --> 38:35.482
We did shrimp three ways,
pan seared shrimp,

38:35.523 --> 38:38.443
the dumplings, and then
deep fried shrimp head.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.570
The dumpling
was a little bit wet,

38:40.612 --> 38:42.697
but the shrimp head was amazing.

38:42.739 --> 38:45.116
Anyone who can get
Meghan Trainor

38:45.158 --> 38:47.786
to eat shrimp head
is a good chef.

38:47.827 --> 38:50.038
And I liked it.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.707
Kaj and Liz,
one of those oysters

38:52.749 --> 38:55.627
will go on any
restaurant in Los Angeles.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.796
- Charbroiled oysters.
- Charbroiled. Absolutely.

38:57.837 --> 38:59.464
Just butter, garlic,
cheese, and hot sauce.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.257
- That was so good.
- Can't go wrong.

39:01.299 --> 39:03.176
And remember,
Kaj and Liz have immunity

39:03.218 --> 39:05.220
so they can't go home today.

39:05.261 --> 39:06.930
Milan and Chandrani,
your presentation

39:06.971 --> 39:08.723
was actually my favorite today.

39:08.765 --> 39:10.642
How did
you think of that concept?

39:10.684 --> 39:12.644
This mustard fish
with a mustard paste

39:12.686 --> 39:14.688
is a very traditional
Bengali dish.

39:14.729 --> 39:18.400
It was super exciting to open
that parcel and get this thing.

39:18.441 --> 39:22.112
However, maybe sear
the fish skin side on

39:22.153 --> 39:23.988
and then
put it in the package.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.950
But that mustard sauce,
I would like to say

39:26.991 --> 39:30.745
that I'm going to steal it, but
Claudette has already stolen it.

39:30.787 --> 39:33.415
It's already going to be
sold tonight in her restaurant,

39:33.456 --> 39:35.792
- so it was that good.
- Please do.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.377
That sauce was beautiful.

39:37.419 --> 39:41.589
Kennedy and Rosie,
your chowder was fantastic.

39:41.631 --> 39:44.092
The crab was beautifully cooked.

39:44.134 --> 39:47.012
- So well executed.
- Thank you.

39:47.053 --> 39:50.682
Ocean and Jaydene. How did you
come up with the combination?

39:50.724 --> 39:53.685
We really wanted to highlight
using all parts of the fish.

39:53.727 --> 39:56.146
There were so many
good things about it.

39:56.187 --> 39:59.983
The crispness of the fish.
The dumplings were delicious.

40:00.025 --> 40:03.486
That broth was watery,
and I know that you would

40:03.528 --> 40:05.405
put so much
labor into the broth.

40:05.447 --> 40:08.033
You have to taste, taste, taste.

40:08.867 --> 40:12.537
Khalil and Willie,
that amazing mussel dish.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.080
Absolutely fantastic.

40:14.122 --> 40:16.416
The first spoonful I was like,
that is spicy.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.960
But then you realize
that it's not just spice.

40:19.002 --> 40:22.088
There's a lot of nuance,
and it kept evolving.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.631
Thank you, chef.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.467
This challenge was so tough.

40:25.508 --> 40:27.385
You guys
did an amazing job with it.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.887
Please head back
to the rec room

40:28.928 --> 40:30.722
and we'll call you
when we're ready.

40:34.559 --> 40:36.811
This is really, really hard.

40:36.853 --> 40:38.688
Like, how are we going
to decide who goes home?

40:38.730 --> 40:40.440
They did something that
was more important

40:40.482 --> 40:41.816
than just cook today.

40:41.858 --> 40:43.651
They proved that you can use,
you know,

40:43.693 --> 40:45.362
sustainable seafood
and trash fish

40:45.403 --> 40:46.780
and create really great food.

40:46.821 --> 40:48.531
I think we can
take Khalil and Willie

40:48.573 --> 40:50.533
and Kennedy and Rosie
off the table

40:50.575 --> 40:52.535
- because love their dishes.
- For sure.

40:52.577 --> 40:54.454
- So much fun.
- You're going to go home

40:54.496 --> 40:56.247
- and make more?
- Yeah.

40:56.289 --> 40:58.500
And Kaj and Liz have immunity.

41:00.669 --> 41:05.423
So, Jack and Bobbie, Milan and
Chandrani, Ocean and Jaydene.

41:05.465 --> 41:07.467
How do they stack up
against each other?

41:07.509 --> 41:10.178
I mean, to me,
Ocean made use of every piece

41:10.220 --> 41:13.056
of that so-called trash
fish and created a dish

41:13.098 --> 41:14.808
that was
delicious and memorable.

41:14.849 --> 41:18.186
But obviously needed a
little bit more legs to develop.

41:18.228 --> 41:19.729
Did you fry it with something?

41:19.771 --> 41:21.815
No, it's just hard
sear on top of the skin.

41:21.856 --> 41:23.566
On the Green Team,
Jack and Bobbie

41:23.608 --> 41:25.318
tried to make shrimp
three different ways.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.362
Didn't land perfect.

41:27.404 --> 41:29.072
But the dumpling
is a very tricky thing,

41:29.114 --> 41:31.282
and that comes down to like,
you got to do it

41:31.324 --> 41:33.034
a bunch of times to know that.

41:33.076 --> 41:37.414
To create that trio of shrimp
in an hour is nearly impossible.

41:37.455 --> 41:39.874
We're thinking this
might be our time.

41:39.916 --> 41:42.043
They did say a lot of
good things too, right?

41:42.085 --> 41:43.795
Yeah.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.381
To me, Milan and Chandrani's
dish was the most fun dish.

41:46.423 --> 41:49.134
It was like, it's a party.

41:49.175 --> 41:50.927
That mustard sauce.

41:50.969 --> 41:53.471
I keep going back to
that mustard sauce.

41:53.513 --> 41:55.557
The fish
wasn't perfectly cooked,

41:55.598 --> 41:58.226
but it was clearly like
the most unique dish of the day.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.853
How do you send them home?

41:59.894 --> 42:01.521
My mom really likes the flavor.

42:01.563 --> 42:03.023
It's a very classic
Bengali thing to do

42:03.064 --> 42:04.858
to keep the skin on the fish.
That's something

42:04.899 --> 42:06.860
I think the judges picked up
on a little bit.

42:06.901 --> 42:09.195
So far, this is the toughest
decision we've ever had to make.

42:09.237 --> 42:11.698
It's just tough when
what mistakes they did make

42:11.740 --> 42:13.742
were not like grave enough
to send them home.

42:14.951 --> 42:16.995
I think we need to bring
them all back in.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.955
Yeah.

42:18.997 --> 42:22.792
***

42:29.883 --> 42:32.969
It was an incredible,
difficult challenge

42:33.011 --> 42:35.764
around such
an important issue.

42:35.805 --> 42:40.101
We were all blown away
how well each one of you did.

42:40.810 --> 42:44.022
Chefs, you made this
incredibly difficult for us...

42:51.446 --> 42:53.490
No one will be
going home tonight.

42:56.826 --> 42:58.036
You had me, bro.

42:58.078 --> 43:00.622
I don't know what to say.
I'm shocked.

43:00.663 --> 43:02.791
I just spent all this
time preparing myself

43:02.832 --> 43:06.878
that we're going home or that
somebody we really care about

43:06.920 --> 43:09.923
is going home today,
and we're all safe.

43:09.964 --> 43:12.467
You succeeded in the mission
to make it impossible

43:12.509 --> 43:14.427
for us to send anyone home.

43:14.469 --> 43:16.179
Great job.

43:16.221 --> 43:19.974
You proved that you can
take very humble ingredients,

43:20.016 --> 43:23.311
very underappreciated fish
and make them special.

43:23.353 --> 43:25.730
You're safe.
Go enjoy it.

43:26.439 --> 43:28.358
Great job, guys. Good job.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.402
Bye guys! So proud of you.

43:31.528 --> 43:33.738
Next on <i>Top Chef Family Style.</i>

43:33.780 --> 43:35.323
- Who's ready for dessert?
- I am.

43:35.365 --> 43:36.866
Dessert is the only thing
that I eat.

43:36.908 --> 43:39.828
You can mess
desserts up super easy.

43:39.869 --> 43:42.580
Oh, my God, this ice cream
has totally melted.

43:42.622 --> 43:45.333
Oh no.
The cakes are totally messed up.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.919
Eva has now completely lost it.

43:47.961 --> 43:49.546
Mom, it's over!

43:51.589 --> 43:53.008
Oh, they got the fire.

43:53.717 --> 43:55.385
I can flambé things!

43:57.220 --> 43:58.430
Whoa.

43:58.471 --> 44:00.390
- Eat it quickly.
- Oh my...

44:00.432 --> 44:02.600
Oh my God, that's the most
delicious thing I've ever had.

44:02.642 --> 44:03.727
- 100%
- So good!

44:03.768 --> 44:05.353
That was so stressful.

44:06.146 --> 44:09.691
If you ever ate that
astronaut food, like chalk.

44:09.733 --> 44:13.528
We pivoted so hard.
