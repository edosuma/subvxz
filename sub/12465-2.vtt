WEBVTT

00:05.271 --> 00:07.406
Eww.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.808
Why is there a car door
in our kitchen?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.711
Lemme guess:
Parker's hanging out
with reggie today.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.248
Good guess, mom.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.685
Afternoon,
mr. And mrs. Roon-dog.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.888
Parker, reggie,
answers, go.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.325
Well, reggie realized
we only have six years
till we can drive

00:26.327 --> 00:29.328
So we decided to start
building our car now.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.967
( chuckles )
reggie days are
always interesting.

00:34.969 --> 00:38.203
I guarantee you
this is not about the car.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.606
Hey, reggie, I need
a second with my folks.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.609
Sure thing, dr. P.
I'll keep the engine running.

00:45.945 --> 00:50.883
Mom, dad, when reggie and I
were digging this door
out of the ditch,

00:50.885 --> 00:54.853
A family of raccoons
kept hissing at us and it
reminded me of something.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.856
That you shouldn't play
in raccoon-infested ditches?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.926
No, looking at their
cute little faces

01:00.928 --> 01:02.961
Reminded me of how badly
I want a dog.

01:02.963 --> 01:06.398
Look, can I please please
get a dog?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.801
Son, I'm going to tell you
the same thing I told maddie

01:08.803 --> 01:12.004
When she wanted a dog
and joey when he wanted
an ostrich.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.809
No dogs or flightless birds
until you prove

01:16.811 --> 01:20.546
- You can take care of one.
- And stop leaving your
underwear on the floor.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.781
It's not relevant,
but it needs to be said.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.784
But I can't prove
I can take care of a dog

01:25.786 --> 01:27.386
Unless I have a dog.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.756
Oh.  Have I created
an impossible scenario

01:30.758 --> 01:34.593
That has kept this house
pet-free for 16 years?

01:35.728 --> 01:37.729
I guess I have.

01:38.898 --> 01:41.834
Proving you can take care
of a dog before you have one

01:41.836 --> 01:43.368
Is your challenge, buddy.

01:44.504 --> 01:45.971
Challenge accepted!

01:47.974 --> 01:49.041
Hey, reggie.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.645
- What up?
- We gotta go upstairs.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.514
Sure thing, dr. P.

01:56.749 --> 01:59.384
Oh, and hit
the car alarm.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.587
( loud whisper )
I don't like the looks
of these two.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.656
( mimics alarm chirp )

02:06.626 --> 02:09.294

- Hey, mom.
- Oh, hey, liv.

03:04.018 --> 03:07.819
I'm glad you're here.
So now that I'm vice principal

03:07.821 --> 03:09.821
- I want to change up my look.
- Okay.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.890
- What do you think?
- Hmm, okay,

03:11.892 --> 03:16.461
Well, I think that
if you are trying to say,

03:16.463 --> 03:19.565
"I am old and I do not care
about your generation,"

03:19.567 --> 03:21.433
Then you have succeeded.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.467
- What?!
- Yeah.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.069
No.  What did I do wrong?

03:24.071 --> 03:26.872
Oh well, you know,
it's just mostly the color

03:26.874 --> 03:29.041
And sort of the silhouette
and-- ( gasps )

03:29.043 --> 03:31.877
- Are those shoulder pads?
- No.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.547
They're parker's socks.
Ew, okay.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.983
Look, I-- I just want
to look cool.

03:37.985 --> 03:41.720
- What do I do?
- Um, just do what
everyone else does--

03:41.722 --> 03:44.723
Go online and find
someone who inspires you
and then copy them.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.927
Is wearing a pantsuit
and shoulder socks,
then find someone else.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.964
You got this,
come on!

03:51.966 --> 03:54.032
- ( all cheer )
- that was beautiful!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.735
- What?
- Are you guys psyched
for your first practice?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.770
- Out of my skin, man.
- Yeah.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.075
What do you mean,
"your first practice"?
Aren't you coming?

04:03.077 --> 04:05.010
No.  I mean,
my leg is healing,

04:05.012 --> 04:06.745
But I've still
got this thing.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.083
( laughs, hisses )
I'm cool.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.986
Besides, I mean
there's plenty of other
things for me to do, so.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.788
Mads, are you really gonna
pretend it's not tough for you

04:16.790 --> 04:19.491
Being all injured,
watching us play the game
that you love,

04:19.493 --> 04:21.426
While diggie,
the guy you like-like,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.195
Is thousands of miles away
in tundrabania?

04:23.197 --> 04:24.930
I mean...

04:24.932 --> 04:27.899
Jeez, willow,
tread lightly.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.870
She's just a hollow shell
of her former self, man.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.941
I'm gonna make a basket
in your honor.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.476
Okay.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.483
In honor of maddie.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.721
Making it for maddie.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.094
Don't take it personally.
I just stink.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.865
Guys, it's okay.
I'm totally fine.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.301
I mean the universe is
just obviously telling me

05:02.303 --> 05:04.636
To explore the things that
I love that are not basketball.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.872
- That's the maddie we know.
- Yeah.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.175
- What are those things?
- Well, you know.

05:10.177 --> 05:13.845
There's all the stuff
that I li-- that I-- um...

05:13.847 --> 05:17.983
Uh, I do the thing that
you all have seen me do.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.954
Oh, on sundays
I always meet with...

05:25.024 --> 05:26.892
Wow.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.829
Hollow shell.
I called it, man.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.708
Okay, space werewolves,
everybody howl.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.043
( howls )

05:45.045 --> 05:47.913
( giggles )
okay, thank you guys so much.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.147
See you in geometry.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.052
Hey, look at you, mads,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.788
Walking around
without your crutches.
You go, girl.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.593
Yeah, I'm still sidelined
from basketball, though,

06:01.595 --> 06:04.296
So I'm just having a little
trouble figuring out what else
it is that I like to do.

06:04.298 --> 06:07.032
What?!
No, you have like
a million hobbies.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.034
You know, there's all
the things that you--

06:11.037 --> 06:13.839
And you know,
there's all the--
when you have-- you used to--

06:14.941 --> 06:17.809
Oh, you know what?
On sundays, you like t...

06:20.580 --> 06:21.980
Wow.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.682
Yeah, wow.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.917
Hey, you know what?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.986
Actually if you are
looking for a hobby,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.955
I have been looking
for the perfect jean jacket

06:29.957 --> 06:32.324
And that could keep us
busy for at least
a couple months.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.160
I'm not that desperate.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.231
- I'll let you know
when I figure it out.
- M'kay, maddie.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.967
That's the spirit.
You're a work
in progress, okay?

06:41.969 --> 06:43.702
( laughs )

06:44.637 --> 06:46.204
( both gasp )

06:52.779 --> 06:54.146
- ( giggles )
- oh.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.922
- What are you doing?
- What you told me to do.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.159
I found someone who inspires me
and tried to dress like her.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.194
- And you picked me?!
- Well, who else?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.963
I browsed your search history
to copy your style,

07:11.965 --> 07:16.067
But I had no idea that I would
land on the exact same outfit
on the exact same day.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.636
- Huh!
- But b.T.Dubs,

07:17.638 --> 07:19.871
♪ I am a-rockin' these
purple panty hose. ♪

07:20.773 --> 07:22.007
Anybody?
Could you help me--

07:22.009 --> 07:23.875
Okay, mom, mom.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.814
No one has said
the word "panty hose"
in at least 50 years, okay?

07:28.816 --> 07:31.016
Second,
b.B.T.T.Dub-dubs,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.984
I forbid you
to dress like me.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.720
Forbid?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.088
Did you just say...

07:37.090 --> 07:39.224
"forbid"?

07:39.226 --> 07:41.259
Okay, so I did,
but I really didn't mean to.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.028
I'm just-- I'm really
upset right now, mom.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.030
No no no no.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.699
You don't forbid me
from doing anything.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.302
I might dress
like you tomorrow just
to teach you a lesson.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.037
( gasps )
you wouldn't dare.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.739
Did you just say "dare"?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.977
Oh, it is on.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.813
From now on,
I'm your twin.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.049
( scoffs )
okay.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.252
- Good luck guessing
tomorrow's outfit.
- Oh no no.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.055
Mama don't need luck.
Mama's got intuition.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.025
Whatcha thinking?
Slacks or a blouse
or a little tie?

08:16.896 --> 08:18.230
I-- snip--

08:18.232 --> 08:19.965
Love-- snip--

08:19.967 --> 08:21.233
Trimming-- snip--

08:21.235 --> 08:23.134
Bonsai.  Snip.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.671
Yeah, perfect.
Bonsai!

08:26.673 --> 08:27.806
( cracks )

08:31.911 --> 08:33.445
Bye-bye, bonsai.

08:35.314 --> 08:36.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.417
I heard you were totally
depressed about basketball

08:39.419 --> 08:43.255
And searching for something
to do with your miserable
miserable life.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.957
Okay, people need
to stop saying that,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.692
Because I am
in no way depressed.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.928
I am simply excited
and looking for a new hobby.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.831
Nice tree.
How many of these
have you killed?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.699
Six.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.003
Lucky for you
I'm a man who's gone through
a lot of hobbies.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.772
Maybe one of my old hobbies

09:00.774 --> 09:02.807
Can be your new hobby.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.877
For example,

09:05.879 --> 09:08.146
The accordion.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.116
( playing tune )

09:17.924 --> 09:19.991
Okay okay okay okay!
Stop.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.063
Fair enough.
The squeezebox is not
for everyone.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.135
Might I suggest
the adrenaline rush
that is...

09:30.137 --> 09:32.037
Taxidermy?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.975
It is an adorable rabbit,
blended with a pheasant

09:36.977 --> 09:38.743
And cool antlers.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.347
I call it
a horned pheas-bit.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.751
Yeah, I call it
proof that you are
deeply disturbed.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.989
What about pottery?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.924
I've made some excellent
pieces in my youth.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.026
Actually yeah.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.028
I remember being
pretty good at that
when I was in grade school.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.030
- ( blows )
- you were good.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.166
I was great.

10:03.102 --> 10:07.105
When I was six,
I had the hands of a god!

10:09.308 --> 10:12.010
It's good to know
you peaked at six, joe.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.481
<i>( dog barking )</i>

10:17.416 --> 10:19.351
Did I hear a dog?

10:20.319 --> 10:22.420
I said no dog.

10:22.422 --> 10:26.925
Technically you said no dog
until I could prove I could
take care of a dog--

10:26.927 --> 10:30.295
An unbeatable logic puzzle
that I have destroyed!

10:33.265 --> 10:36.468
Say hello to my newest
invention clunker.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.004
( whirring, barking )

10:41.007 --> 10:43.141
Oh, chase your tail, boy.
Chase your tail.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.448
He's a realistic
robot dog

10:50.450 --> 10:52.050
Who can be walked, fed

10:52.052 --> 10:54.586
And used to change
parental minds.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.521
-  <i>( barks )</i>
<i>- he even fetches.</i>

10:56.523 --> 10:58.056
Come on, boy.
Go go go go.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.525
Go, go get it, boy.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.964
And he'll prove
I'm responsible enough

11:05.966 --> 11:08.033
To have a dog.
You see, if clunker doesn't get

11:08.035 --> 11:11.002
Regularly played with,
he's programmed to explode.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.075
Impressive,
but this proves nothing.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.444
There's more to taking care
of a dog than playing.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.247
There's feeding,
grooming, bathing.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.883
I can't do
any of those things.
He's a robot.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.886
Just out of curiosity

11:27.888 --> 11:30.422
How long can you
leave clunker alone

11:30.424 --> 11:32.223
Before he explodes?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.459
<i>( explosion )</i>

11:38.097 --> 11:40.899
About that long.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.876
I pet the dog
and he blew up.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.285
<i>( accordion playing )</i>

12:10.996 --> 12:13.164
Why did I desert you,
old friend?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.366
Because we all
begged you to stop.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.268
Check it out!

12:19.004 --> 12:22.040
Apparently these hands aren't
just great for sinking shots.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.109
They're also great
for making pots.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.546
Well, I guess rapping
is another hobby you
won't be doing.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.348
( both laughs )

12:30.350 --> 12:31.950
Yeah, I just--
I really wanted you

12:31.952 --> 12:35.386
'cause after all, I never
would have rediscovered it
without you.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.155
You are so welcome.

12:37.157 --> 12:41.092
I find joy
by encouraging young people
to be their very best self.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.029
- What do you think?
- Oh, me?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.431
- Yeah.
- I don't like to judge,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.233
But here, let's see.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.302
The handle's
out of proportion, the bowl
isn't shaped quite right--

12:51.304 --> 12:53.138
Too much slip.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.341
How do I say this nicely?
It's-- ahem--

12:56.343 --> 12:58.276
It's-- it's awful.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.013
"awful"?
Okay, no.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.382
Mad dog rooney is not
awful at anything.

13:04.384 --> 13:08.186
I'm gonna show him that
I can become the greatest
potter of all time.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.188
Bam!  Pot!

13:12.124 --> 13:14.425
Yeah, I really need to come up
with a new pottery catchphrase.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.435
Uh, what's going on, buddy?

13:24.437 --> 13:26.971
You've been bested
again, father.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.507
I rebuilt clunker
and removed all his circuitry

13:29.509 --> 13:30.742
So I could give him a bath.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.511
Boom!
Squeaky clean canine!

13:36.715 --> 13:39.150
( gasps )

13:39.152 --> 13:41.519
Underbelly's clean, dr. P.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.089
Now can I get a dog?

13:45.091 --> 13:48.459
Well, you see, you haven't faced
the one truly nasty job

13:48.461 --> 13:50.328
Every real dog owner dreads.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.597
Scooping up poop.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.000
He's a robot.
There's no poop to scoop.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.770
No poop, no pooch.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.172
I won!

14:01.174 --> 14:02.607
I can't believe it.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.143
The dad never wins.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.412
I need a dog who poops?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.314
Then say goodbye to clunker

14:09.316 --> 14:12.217
And say hello to dumper.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.024
Hello, liv.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.462
Well enough to know
there is no possible way

14:24.464 --> 14:26.598
That you could know what's
underneath this blanket.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.605
- Nicely done, but you've
underestimated your mother.
-    <i>( gasps )</i>

14:34.773 --> 14:37.075
- Boom!
- But how?

14:37.077 --> 14:40.245
Mother's instinct.
I made your brains
in this womb.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.047
- Hmph!
-  <i>( accordion playing )</i>

14:58.097 --> 14:59.631
Seriously, dad,

14:59.633 --> 15:02.267
I think a dog will make
this family a little
more normal.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.204
I stayed up literally
all night

15:06.206 --> 15:09.173
Making every single thing
that we are going to eat
off of this morning

15:09.175 --> 15:11.809
- And I call it maddieware.
- ( chuckling )

15:13.345 --> 15:15.313
So how does everybody
want their eggs?

15:15.315 --> 15:19.484
A crab and asparagus omelet
with apricot marmalade.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.354
Scrambled.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.824
- Uh, coffee?
- Thank you.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.093
- The mugs are
in the cabinet.
- Okay.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.196
Wow, maddie, that is
a lot of pottery.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.198
And it's got
some heft to it.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.801
( maddie hisses )
yeah, I know.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.403
I'm getting good, huh?

15:38.405 --> 15:42.106
Basketball is out
and pottery is in.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.709
So don't hate it,
plate it.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.378
- ( laughs )
- good for you, mad dog.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.348
- To maddieware.
- To maddieware.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.850
Yeah-- oh.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.887
- ( clinks )
- oh!  Uh, maddie,
we've got a leaker.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.122
- Uh-- uh...
- Um, okay.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.857
You know what?
Don't even worry about it

15:59.859 --> 16:02.760
- Because there's plenty more
where that came from.
- Oh.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.386
Hey.
Check out my new hobby:

16:28.388 --> 16:30.521
Smashing things.
( chuckles )

16:30.523 --> 16:32.590
I'm actually
pretty good at it.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.396
You're having a tough time,
aren't you?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.231
No...

16:42.701 --> 16:44.569
Yeah.
( laughs )

16:46.205 --> 16:48.406
Yeah, it's actually
pretty awful, dad.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.942
( sighs )
I mean, I--

16:50.944 --> 16:52.844
I have no idea
what to do.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.447
I love basketball
and now I can't play it.

16:57.916 --> 17:01.319
I mean what happens
if I just never recover
from this injury?

17:02.254 --> 17:03.988
It's a long hard road,

17:03.990 --> 17:06.791
But you're a fighter
and you're gonna
get back on top.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.460
- You think so?
- I know so.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.566
And until then, remember:
Just because you can't
do something you love,

17:15.568 --> 17:18.236
Doesn't mean you have
to stop loving it.

17:18.238 --> 17:22.340
Consider yourself lucky
that you found something
you love so much.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.578
Thanks, dad.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.882
In the meantime
I, for one, am glad

17:30.884 --> 17:33.251
You stink at pottery.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.688
This is fun!

17:38.590 --> 17:40.925
- Oh--
- in there!

17:42.761 --> 17:45.463
Yeah, dad, that was mom's
favorite garden gnome.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.568
Ooo-kay.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.704
Can you go back to pottery
to make one last thing?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.606
Yeah, you know it!

17:56.809 --> 17:58.810
Bam!  Pot!

18:00.746 --> 18:02.780
Okay, I know
it's not good, okay?
I'm working on it.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.018
<i>( western showdown theme</i>
<i>playing )</i>

18:14.326 --> 18:15.893
You weren't
at breakfast.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.463
I left early so that we could
do this on my turf.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.631
How is this your turf?
I'm vice principal.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.933
Okay, fine.
I had spin class.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.004
Are we gonna
do this or not?
Behold!

18:29.675 --> 18:31.843
Thanks.
Ahem!

18:31.845 --> 18:33.778
Check and mate,
mother.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.347
This is my custom-made

18:36.349 --> 18:39.717
$10,000 one-of-a-kind
tristan lycanth costume

18:39.719 --> 18:43.855
And there is no way
that you could have
copied all of this.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.656
( chuckles )

18:45.658 --> 18:46.958
You're right.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.993
There is no way
I could.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.462
But if the home-ec class
decided to stay up all night

18:51.464 --> 18:54.899
Because the vice principal
promised them extra credit,
they could!

18:54.901 --> 18:56.767
Okay.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.740
Have you lost
your mind?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.343
Am I crazy
or am I a genius?

19:06.512 --> 19:07.912
You look pretty crazy
to me, man.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.715
Off the rails,
mrs. Rooney.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.388
- Oh.
- ( nervous laughter )

19:17.390 --> 19:19.690
- Oh.
- Mom, what are we doing?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.559
I can't remember
anymore.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.030
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
forbidden you.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.866
I should have just
helped you when you said
you wanted to look cool.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.401
- Oh.
- So let me help you now.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.970
- You would help me?
- Of course!

19:32.972 --> 19:34.972
I mean, mom,
when I put on this suit,

19:34.974 --> 19:38.009
I am under an oath to protect
the lost and downtrodden.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.547
Thank you, sweetie.
Okay, I am going
to go change.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.982
Mom, just really quickly
before you do.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.355
( gasps )

19:51.357 --> 19:54.525
The galactic orb
from "space werewolves"?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.494
- Come on, you know
you want to.
- Oh!

19:57.429 --> 19:59.664
Mess with the wolf,
you get the howl.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.099
( howling )

20:04.870 --> 20:07.371
Really?!
You two have to do this

20:07.373 --> 20:10.741
On the day that I premiere
my kitten-in-a-burrito shirt?

20:10.743 --> 20:13.711
When does it get to be
about joey, huh?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.580
Huh?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.917
Willow:
Come on, lady porcupines!
Nice nice!

20:19.919 --> 20:22.620
-    <i>Put it up!</i>
<i>- Pete: That's what</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

20:22.622 --> 20:24.155
- Good job.
- Nicely done.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.923
( whistle blares )

20:29.761 --> 20:31.762
Where have I seen
that shirt before?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.598
Joey gave it to me!

20:35.867 --> 20:38.002
Look alive,
lady porcupines!

20:38.004 --> 20:40.037
- ( gasps ) maddie!
- Hey.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.673
Okay!
Uh, willow,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.610
What are you doing?
I literally just saw you
in history class.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.179
I'm just so happy
to see you here.

20:48.181 --> 20:51.182
Put her down, willow.
That's it.

20:51.184 --> 20:53.784
Put her down.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.021
- ( exhales )
- something's different
about you.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.993
You found
yourself, man.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.929
Yeah well,
a smart man told me

21:04.931 --> 21:07.832
That even though you can't
do something you love anymore

21:07.834 --> 21:09.667
It doesn't mean
you can't still love it.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.970
She's talking about me.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.540
I'm the smart man.

21:17.810 --> 21:22.146
I was wondering if
it would be okay if I just
hung around a little bit?

21:22.148 --> 21:24.015
Just even until I can
start playing again?

21:24.017 --> 21:27.151
- You're still captain.
- Oh yes, maddie's back!

21:27.153 --> 21:28.886
Yay.
( blows whistle )

21:28.888 --> 21:31.489
All right, losers!
Break time's over.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.859
30 wind sprints.
We stop when someone pukes.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.694
Bam!  What?

21:36.696 --> 21:38.863
You don't mess
with a classic.

21:43.735 --> 21:47.004
Okay, dumper's
now fully loaded
with chocolate pudding.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.240
When my dad comes out,
dumper will do his thing,

21:49.242 --> 21:51.842
I'll clean it up and he'll have
to let me get a real dog.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.211
And if he doesn't listen,
we'll drag him back
to the ditch

21:54.213 --> 21:58.115
Cover him in peanut butter
and feed him to the raccoons.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.551
It's nice having a friend
who can out-weird me.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.522
All right, boys,
show me what you got.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.924
Okay, dumper,
do your thing.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.760
- Here comes the money!
- ( whirs )

22:11.663 --> 22:13.898
( whirring dies )

22:13.900 --> 22:15.966
( huffs )
it's not working.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.236
Challenge failed.

22:20.205 --> 22:24.775
Buddy, don't be
so hard on yourself.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.945
The way you've taken care
of this robot--
it's impressive.

22:27.947 --> 22:31.615
- You proved you're ready
for a dog.
- Oh yes!

22:45.030 --> 22:45.930
No dog.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.874
Ahh!  I have been having
the best time with mom,

22:56.876 --> 22:58.876
- Helping her pick out
a new look.
- Uh-huh.

22:58.878 --> 23:03.047
Her clothes now say
"I'm the vice principal,
but I'm still hip."

23:03.049 --> 23:05.015
Uh-huh.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.618
And I also got her
a box of red ants

23:07.620 --> 23:09.620
That can crawl up her leg
whenever they want.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.322
Oh, liv, that's perfect.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.594
- Are you listening
to anything I am saying?
- No, I am not.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.796
I'm gonna go talk
to the new girl.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.066
( exhales )

23:22.068 --> 23:24.168
Hey, girl!

23:24.170 --> 23:25.903
Hmm?

23:25.905 --> 23:28.706
( shrieks )
gouge my eyes out!

23:28.708 --> 23:31.308
Gouge them out now!
