06:57.602 --> 06:59.338
<i>Yeah, look.

<i>Jesus, Bunny, will you

07:04.609 --> 07:06.912
Look Bunny, they're not gonna

07:06.912 --> 07:08.313
Okay?

07:08.313 --> 07:09.848

07:09.848 --> 07:12.617
<i>It's probably a reaction to

07:12.617 --> 07:13.885

Alright? You seen any of

07:16.521 --> 07:18.256
- No, not yet.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

07:18.256 --> 07:20.258

Capitol Hill!

07:20.258 --> 07:22.094

He's just swingin' a dick.

07:22.094 --> 07:23.695
<i>I'll take care of it!
You hear me?</i>

07:24.029 --> 07:26.665
Now, Mike.
Deal with this shit now.

07:27.399 --> 07:28.734
'Cause I don't like this
feelin'.

07:28.734 --> 07:31.136
The only place I'm supposed to
be gettin' transferred to

07:31.136 --> 07:33.105
is my fuckin' bed, Mike.

07:33.105 --> 07:34.373
You hear that?

07:34.373 --> 07:36.575
<i>I got it!
Don't worry, all right?</i>

07:38.977 --> 07:41.446

07:42.881 --> 07:44.616
Good fucking morning to me.

07:46.084 --> 07:47.486
Motherfucker.

08:08.101 --> 08:09.269
Hey, Mike.
You got a second?

08:09.269 --> 08:10.670
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Mike.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.138
No, you're not talkin' to
anybody, you understand me?

08:12.138 --> 08:13.339
Every time you open your mouth,

08:13.339 --> 08:14.874
you add another year to
your sentence.

08:14.874 --> 08:16.709
- You seen Evelyn?
- In her office.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.044
She's elbow deep in it.

08:18.044 --> 08:19.245
They're sharpening their knives
after that riot.

08:19.245 --> 08:20.914
The massacre on 23rd?

08:20.914 --> 08:22.248
Not a good look
for the home team.

08:22.248 --> 08:23.683
They bounce the DA,
I don't think they're playin'

08:23.683 --> 08:24.717
next man up.

08:24.717 --> 08:25.985
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.

08:25.985 --> 08:27.320
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah?

08:27.320 --> 08:29.556
This guy goes in,
you got any swing at Anchor Bay?

08:31.457 --> 08:33.126
Yeah, let me know
where he lands,

08:33.126 --> 08:34.260
I'll see what I can do.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.528
- You got it.
- Thanks, Mike!

08:35.528 --> 08:37.163
- Yeah.
- What did I say to you?

08:39.332 --> 08:41.668
- She inside?
- Yes.

08:44.571 --> 08:45.538
Hey.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.174
So...

08:49.943 --> 08:51.578
Did you know about
this shit show?

08:52.245 --> 08:53.379
What happened to your face?

08:53.379 --> 08:55.081
Clearin' out Tent City.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.283
Yeah.

08:58.084 --> 09:00.153
Mike, how long did you think
that this was gonna keep goin'?

09:00.153 --> 09:01.521
Well, I don't know, Evelyn!

09:01.521 --> 09:04.023
Maybe long enough for us
to finish what we started.

09:04.023 --> 09:05.391
Right?

09:05.391 --> 09:06.926
I mean, why put the fuckin'
leaders inside

09:06.926 --> 09:08.261
if they have no chance to lead?

09:08.261 --> 09:11.397
I don't have control over
the moves the DOC makes!

09:11.397 --> 09:13.833
Or the moves that you and
your associates make.

09:13.833 --> 09:17.170
Honestly, Mike, I have so much
shit on my plate right now,

09:17.170 --> 09:18.771
I do not have room for gravy.

09:19.739 --> 09:20.807
Gravy?

09:21.140 --> 09:22.942
You made deals, Evelyn.

09:23.810 --> 09:26.145
Deals with my name in
your fuckin' mouth.

09:29.248 --> 09:31.517
Like I said.
Bigger problems.

09:32.552 --> 09:35.321
The ACLU is lookin' for
someone to take the fall

09:35.321 --> 09:36.856
for the deaths in the prison.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.158
I have DOJ fuckin' pressure.

09:39.926 --> 09:42.161
They're lookin' to burn
this whole fuckin' house down.

09:42.161 --> 09:43.596
Including me.

09:43.596 --> 09:45.531
And this house might fall on
your SWAT friend, too,

09:45.531 --> 09:47.600
so forgive me if
I don't give a shit

09:47.600 --> 09:49.902
if a couple of street criminals
are inconvenienced.

09:49.902 --> 09:51.671
We made a deal with
Bunny Washington

09:51.671 --> 09:52.839
and the other generals.

09:52.839 --> 09:54.440
Do you understand that?

09:56.342 --> 09:59.812
The DA is working on
release papers, but this is...

10:01.114 --> 10:02.215
complicated.

10:02.215 --> 10:03.616
For all of us.

10:03.616 --> 10:04.651
And once he signs,

10:04.651 --> 10:06.386
the judge still has to
sign off, too.

10:06.386 --> 10:08.421
You're so full of shit, Evelyn!

10:08.421 --> 10:10.289
You know what?
Just fuckin' leave, Mike.

10:10.289 --> 10:12.291
I don't have the time or
the fuckin' bandwidth for this.

10:12.291 --> 10:15.528
This guy's fucking using the bus
that I fucking gave him

10:15.528 --> 10:17.196
for his own fuckin' benefit!

10:17.196 --> 10:19.032
To make him look like less of
a limp dick

10:19.032 --> 10:20.400
than he already fuckin' is.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.135
He's gonna fuck it up, Evelyn!

10:22.602 --> 10:25.038
More bodies.
More fuckin' chaos.

10:25.038 --> 10:26.172
You want that?

10:26.172 --> 10:27.340
Fuckin' prick.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.375
He doesn't know these people...

10:30.176 --> 10:31.644
I do...

10:33.079 --> 10:36.049
And when shit goes south
on the inside,

10:36.482 --> 10:38.618
it's gonna find him
on the outside.

10:39.619 --> 10:42.655
Did you just fucking threaten
the District Attorney, Mike?

10:42.655 --> 10:44.857
Just get him to sign
the fuckin' papers, would ya?!

10:47.060 --> 10:50.363
Evelyn, I need my guy the fuck out.

11:02.608 --> 11:04.844
I don't really have a job
right now.

11:06.245 --> 11:08.181
Although Mike, he says...

11:08.181 --> 11:10.283
he needs my help,
I can help out,

11:10.283 --> 11:11.751
some shit like that, but...

11:13.820 --> 11:14.821
I don't know.

11:17.957 --> 11:19.425
Havin' a kid.

11:23.496 --> 11:25.465
Namin' him after you.

11:32.939 --> 11:34.373
I just don't...

11:34.373 --> 11:36.242
I don't know what to do, Mitch.

11:36.242 --> 11:38.845
I, I feel like I'm really
fuckin' this up.

11:42.682 --> 11:46.119
You know, I just need some
fuckin' help, man.

11:46.119 --> 11:47.320
I just...

11:47.320 --> 11:48.554
If you could fuckin'
help me out,

11:48.554 --> 11:50.022
I'd really appreciate it.

11:50.923 --> 11:51.891
Fuck.

12:32.865 --> 12:34.767
<i>I don't control shit
in here, Mike, you know?</i>

12:34.767 --> 12:36.335
<i>I mean, I can tell you when
somebody gets</i>

12:36.335 --> 12:37.837
<i>transferred or moved,</i>

12:37.837 --> 12:39.806
<i>but other than that,
my hands are tied right now.</i>

12:40.106 --> 12:41.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I get it.

12:41.207 --> 12:42.942
Just be my eyes and ears,
all right?

12:42.942 --> 12:44.076
If anything moves out there.

12:44.076 --> 12:46.312
- <i>No shit.</i>
- Okay? Thank you.

12:47.146 --> 12:48.548
Good morning.
What's up?

12:49.515 --> 12:50.950
Oh, just...

12:53.186 --> 12:54.854
It's fuckin' weird bein' here.

12:54.854 --> 12:56.122
This...

12:56.122 --> 12:57.957
place looks just like
the old one.

13:00.126 --> 13:01.127
Yeah.

13:01.527 --> 13:02.829
You want some?

13:03.229 --> 13:04.964
Yeah, please.

13:06.098 --> 13:07.400
Where the fuck's Rebecca?

13:08.167 --> 13:12.238
She's a Post-It note.
"Back in five" it said.

13:12.238 --> 13:13.673
What's up, Brother?

13:16.309 --> 13:17.810
Oh, Jesus.

13:17.810 --> 13:20.613
I need a job, Mike.
Not a chore.

13:21.347 --> 13:22.682
Like a fuckin' job, job.

13:23.082 --> 13:24.417
And I can help, man.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.985
I'm good at shit.

13:26.652 --> 13:28.054
You know?
I can...

13:28.287 --> 13:29.889
I'm a fuckin' worker, man.

13:30.489 --> 13:31.958
You know that.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.926
Yeah, that's why I sent you
to the train station, the buses,

13:33.926 --> 13:35.127
to find Iris, you know?

13:35.127 --> 13:36.329
And I did that.

13:36.329 --> 13:38.998
But I can't keep posting up, just...

13:39.365 --> 13:41.067
waitin' for her to appear, Mike.

13:41.968 --> 13:43.769
I can do shit here.

13:43.769 --> 13:45.471
I, I can free up time for you.

13:45.471 --> 13:47.340
Because you've got a full house, Mike.

13:47.340 --> 13:49.075
Been that way ever since
the riot.

13:50.543 --> 13:52.612
You need hands, Brother.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.648
I got idle ones.

13:56.282 --> 13:58.084
I need to contribute, Mike.

13:58.885 --> 14:00.620
You know, a man's gotta...

14:00.620 --> 14:02.655
you know, feel like he's worth
somethin'.

14:02.655 --> 14:03.689
You know?

14:19.438 --> 14:21.474
Okay, here's the deal...

14:24.310 --> 14:26.445
This stuff is as good as money.

14:28.281 --> 14:29.715
Technically, they don't exist

14:29.715 --> 14:32.118
because they were used with
a bunch of criminal stuff.

14:32.451 --> 14:35.087
But, and this is a big but...

14:37.556 --> 14:39.125
Technically...

14:39.659 --> 14:41.794
Though they aren't issuing them anymore,

14:42.361 --> 14:44.397
if the issuer is still active,

14:44.830 --> 14:47.800
the value of the bonds
can be recovered.

14:51.671 --> 14:55.308
So, even if we get back
a tenth of what they're worth,

14:55.841 --> 14:57.810
we're still fuckin'
millionaires.

15:11.791 --> 15:15.695
<i>Inmate Mann</i> . <i>617178.</i>

15:15.695 --> 15:18.564
<i>Report to exit checkpoint.</i>

15:20.666 --> 15:21.901
I get a word?

15:23.836 --> 15:24.870
Speak.

15:27.173 --> 15:28.741
Me and you.

15:46.258 --> 15:49.829
This is some fucked-up shit,
you know what I'm sayin'?

15:50.329 --> 15:51.263
Uh-huh.

15:51.263 --> 15:53.432
Your boy screwed us.

15:53.432 --> 15:55.634
He ain't my boy 'til
he make this shit right.

15:56.135 --> 15:58.604
Mike's supposed to know
how this shit goes,

15:58.604 --> 16:00.172
supposed to be one of us.

16:00.172 --> 16:01.340
What the hell that mean?

16:01.340 --> 16:03.609
You think he played us.

16:03.609 --> 16:06.345
- He ain't like that.
- You sure?

16:06.979 --> 16:10.349
I don't see that motherfucker
rattlin' no cages.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.251
All I see is him outside,

16:12.251 --> 16:15.755
and you stuck in this cage
waitin' to be shipped out

16:15.755 --> 16:17.490
like some fucking cattle
to the slaughterhouse.

16:17.490 --> 16:18.724
You best be careful,

16:18.724 --> 16:20.793
you got that damn name in
your mouth, Casper.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.595
I'm just sayin'.

16:23.596 --> 16:25.364
We don't get outta here soon,

16:25.364 --> 16:27.199
don't know when
we'll ever get out.

16:27.199 --> 16:28.567
Way I see it,

16:28.567 --> 16:30.636
you did some assault and shit in
here already.

16:30.636 --> 16:31.937
You fucked a brother up good.

16:31.937 --> 16:33.873
Wrong dude gets eyes on that,

16:33.873 --> 16:37.043
you're lookin' at another ten
before you even start.

16:38.778 --> 16:41.547
Tell your boy to do
his fuckin' job.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.363
You been in my lockbox?

17:04.298 --> 17:06.833
You do not want none of
this smoke, Shortcake.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.335
I ain't fuckin' around!

17:08.869 --> 17:11.338
I had cash, and I had pills.

17:11.338 --> 17:12.839
Okay, so you wanna do this?

17:12.839 --> 17:14.942
I just wanna know where
my shit is.

17:14.942 --> 17:15.776
You're new.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.878
So I'mma save that pretty face.

17:18.178 --> 17:20.681
The cash you had
is probably upstairs.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.450
And those pills you keep
in that little baggie?

17:23.784 --> 17:25.385
Probably just went
in your mouth.

17:25.953 --> 17:27.020
Okay?

17:27.688 --> 17:29.022
Let's go, ladies!

17:31.191 --> 17:32.259
We got money to make!

17:32.259 --> 17:33.393
Fuckin' bitch.

17:41.969 --> 17:44.304
The matriarch hyena
does the hunting.

17:44.805 --> 17:46.273
They're not like most animals.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.641
They band together

17:47.641 --> 17:49.309
to stop fights.

17:49.643 --> 17:51.945
And deal with the problems
inside the clan.

17:55.182 --> 17:56.216
Are you...

17:56.216 --> 17:59.119
going to be a problem in
our clan, Iris?

18:20.674 --> 18:22.209
Give me ten.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.056
Got news for me?

18:36.056 --> 18:38.792
This fuckin' DA.
This prick.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.363
He's takin' a victory lap
for this bust.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.465
Give him a minute,

18:45.799 --> 18:47.668
then he's gonna
sign the fuckin' papers,

18:47.668 --> 18:49.002
he's gonna get the
judge to stamp it,

18:49.002 --> 18:50.804
and then you're out
in the free world, okay?

18:50.804 --> 18:52.072
Then we're done here.

18:52.072 --> 18:53.907
They're shippin' people out
every day, Mike.

18:54.574 --> 18:55.909
A week from now,

18:55.909 --> 18:57.344
they gonna be tearin'
this whole place down.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.012
I know.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.847
Look man, I ain't fuckin' with
gettin' back on this ride, Mike.

19:00.847 --> 19:02.249
This was supposed to be
a temporary deal.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.684
It is.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.052
It ain't feelin'
like it, Mike.

19:05.052 --> 19:06.787
I ain't here for settin' up
the game all over again,

19:06.787 --> 19:09.089
in some Anchor Bay
bullshit-style pen, Mike!

19:09.089 --> 19:11.625
I'm not!
I set the order here!

19:11.625 --> 19:14.327
I did my shit.
It's your fuckin' turn, man!

19:14.327 --> 19:15.562
Yes, you did.

19:15.562 --> 19:17.464
And I'm getting my side done, okay?

19:18.465 --> 19:19.733
Just relax.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.004
I'm pissin' in
a fuckin' trough, man.

19:24.738 --> 19:26.440
I'm the king of Mudville
up in this bitch.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.509
Now you, you tellin' me
to be cool and shit?

19:29.910 --> 19:31.978
Wait for you to get
the order goin' on the outside,

19:31.978 --> 19:34.648
while I get shipped over to
who the fuck knows where?

19:34.648 --> 19:36.416
I'm gonna get you
the fuck outta here.

19:36.416 --> 19:38.752
Okay?
You have my word.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.321
Just...

19:42.189 --> 19:44.324
Put Rafael on point, right?
Set him up, and...

19:44.324 --> 19:48.128
No, man, he can't run shit
in my shadow, all right?

19:48.128 --> 19:50.397
As long as I'm here, I'm point.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.665
You know how this work.

19:51.665 --> 19:54.000
I need you to continue
trusting me.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.202
Man, it's startin' to feel like

19:55.202 --> 19:57.037
trusting you is bad
for business, Mike.

19:57.037 --> 19:58.605
You got motherfuckers
in this bitch

19:58.605 --> 19:59.606
lookin' at you sideways.

19:59.606 --> 20:00.941
And I can't blame 'em.

20:02.008 --> 20:03.744
You don't get this shit right
right fuckin' fast,

20:03.744 --> 20:05.178
I cannot stop shit from doin'

20:05.178 --> 20:07.414
what the fuck
it's gonna do, baby.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.615
People gon' take their own.

20:08.982 --> 20:11.918
And right now, you got some...

20:11.918 --> 20:15.555
angry-ass motherfuckers
lookin' right at you.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.394
Who?

20:24.197 --> 20:26.266
It's hard to say who's gonna
come knockin'.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.101
I'll handle it.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.836
Man, you ain't bulletproof
any more than Mitch was, man.

20:29.836 --> 20:31.104
And that shit was some
random-ass shit.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.640
This shit right here,
it's not gon' be that.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.509
This shit gon' be some payback.

20:37.177 --> 20:38.345
Thanks for the warning.

20:38.345 --> 20:39.813
You on the clock now, Mike.

20:39.813 --> 20:42.182
Every second.
Every minute.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.251
We're all on the clock, Bunny.

20:44.251 --> 20:46.052
Since the day
we're fuckin' born.

20:46.052 --> 20:48.288
Okay?
This is all just borrowed time.

20:48.288 --> 20:53.860
Mike, get your shit in order,
or they comin' for your ass.

20:54.761 --> 20:56.129
And soon.

20:57.697 --> 20:59.332
Reachin' a point of no return.

21:21.388 --> 21:22.422
Wait in the car.

21:23.990 --> 21:25.325
We gonna be late, Dad.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.426
Just be a minute.

21:28.695 --> 21:29.830
Makin' this a habit.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.464
Yeah, I needed to get you
first thing.

21:31.765 --> 21:33.266
Well, use the phone.

21:33.266 --> 21:35.035
- I'm takin' my kid to school.
- Well, I would.

21:35.035 --> 21:37.003
Just give me a minute, though.
I know, I get it.

21:37.771 --> 21:39.139
Do you...

21:39.139 --> 21:41.241
Did you get heads up on
these fuckin' transfers?

21:42.242 --> 21:43.710
I get a heads up, yeah.

21:44.277 --> 21:45.679
You didn't wanna share that?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.380
Like you shared that smackdown?

21:48.849 --> 21:50.383
Trying to insulate you
in that shit.

21:50.383 --> 21:51.618
Come on, now.

21:51.885 --> 21:52.953
Jesus fuck.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.755
- Can you slow roll this shit?
- It's not my call.

21:55.755 --> 21:58.058
All I do is sign off
on the transfers,

21:58.058 --> 21:59.659
then track deliveries.

21:59.659 --> 22:01.161
Like, like FedEx.

22:01.161 --> 22:03.663
All right, keep Bunny and
all the other leaders

22:03.663 --> 22:05.031
inside Tent City.

22:05.031 --> 22:06.666
All right, if they get
fuckin' moved...

22:07.167 --> 22:08.268
before they're supposed to be released,

22:08.268 --> 22:09.769
this whole thing is gonna
fuckin' fall apart.

22:09.769 --> 22:11.037
You askin' or tellin'?

22:11.037 --> 22:12.405
Come on.
Just fuckin' do it.

22:12.405 --> 22:13.907
Who do you think you're
talking to?

22:14.374 --> 22:15.842
You're not the mayor
to me, Mike.

22:15.842 --> 22:17.244
I don't work for you.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.446
I'm supposed to kid glove
these guys,

22:19.446 --> 22:21.615
because it helps some "plan"
you think you got?

22:21.615 --> 22:23.116
You know the sayin',

22:23.116 --> 22:24.818
"Everybody got a plan 'til they
get punched in the face."

22:24.818 --> 22:26.119
Well, I've been punched
in the face,

22:26.119 --> 22:27.654
so I'm makin' my own plans, now.

22:27.654 --> 22:29.456
Come on!
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

22:30.056 --> 22:31.124
We lose Bunny...

22:31.625 --> 22:33.126
...and you lose all
the other generals...

22:33.126 --> 22:34.794
you lose
the fuckin' prison.

22:34.794 --> 22:36.329
And then we lose
fuckin' Kingstown.

22:36.963 --> 22:38.465
It's fuckin' Gomorrah
all over again.

22:38.465 --> 22:41.268
And there's nowhere safe
for your kid to go.

22:43.103 --> 22:45.472
I'm not asking you
to fuckin' help me.

22:45.472 --> 22:46.573
I get nothing outta this.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.209
I'm tellin' you to fuckin'
help yourself.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.580
You have the power, Kareem.
So use it.

22:53.813 --> 22:54.681
All right?

23:10.057 --> 23:11.659
What's goin' on there,
Horace?

23:11.859 --> 23:13.094
Hey, Colton.

23:14.862 --> 23:16.431
I thought you
and the lady kicked.

23:17.165 --> 23:18.466
I just...

23:19.967 --> 23:21.169
I got a question.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.239
I need some help,
and I didn't know who to ask.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.741
Look man, you got
somethin' to pawn?

23:26.741 --> 23:28.776
If you wanna buy some shit or
score some shit, I got you.

23:28.776 --> 23:31.779
Otherwise I ain't got time for
your "Dear Abby" shit right now.

23:43.257 --> 23:45.159
What the fuck am I supposed to
do with this shit?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.762
I can give you 50 grand worth
of these things.

23:48.029 --> 23:49.697
You give me 10 grand,
we're solid.

23:50.498 --> 23:52.333
You got me on camera
right now?

23:52.934 --> 23:54.602
What?
No.

23:54.602 --> 23:57.605
'Cause I figure this gotta be
some <i>Candid Camera</i> bullshit.

23:58.739 --> 24:01.476
I looked it up, man.
This shit's worth real money.

24:01.476 --> 24:03.644
Look man, if you wanna buy
some shit, I got you.

24:03.644 --> 24:05.413
Otherwise, get your skinny ass
out of my store.

24:05.413 --> 24:06.681
And take your old-timey
bank notes with you.

24:06.681 --> 24:09.750
It's as real as cash, man,
I swear, like...

24:10.318 --> 24:11.719
fuckin' traveler's checks.

24:11.719 --> 24:14.355
Go take a trip, take your girl,
go to Paris, have fun.

24:14.355 --> 24:16.090
Get the fuck outta my store.

24:21.395 --> 24:23.164
I don't know how to move 'em.

24:24.298 --> 24:26.067
I just thought, you know...

24:28.102 --> 24:29.770
I thought you might know someone.

24:32.206 --> 24:34.041
There's someone I know,
you don't wanna know.

24:35.009 --> 24:37.211
But I'm gonna tell you a truth
you already know, Horace.

24:37.211 --> 24:39.280
Trying to mess around with shit
like this paper will

24:39.280 --> 24:40.748
take you to a bad place.

24:40.748 --> 24:42.216
A place you don't wanna be at.

24:42.950 --> 24:45.786
So build a fire, have a party.
Burn all this shit up.

24:46.254 --> 24:48.489
Forget the hopes and dreams
you placed on that shit.

24:49.790 --> 24:50.825
You hear me?

24:56.264 --> 24:58.299
Who do you know?
Please.

25:06.073 --> 25:07.608
What is that book?

25:07.608 --> 25:08.743
Like you care.

25:08.743 --> 25:09.977
No, I do.

25:09.977 --> 25:11.913
It's about slaves in
ancient Rome.

25:11.913 --> 25:14.148
I care about slaves
in ancient Rome.

25:14.148 --> 25:15.716
Give me a break.

25:15.716 --> 25:16.951
Ian!

25:16.951 --> 25:18.252
Give me one second, one second.

25:18.252 --> 25:20.154
Danny, what's up?

25:21.689 --> 25:24.091
Man, it's gonna get
freakin' hairy.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.360
Anchor Bay is dumpin'
'em by the thousands.

25:27.328 --> 25:28.329
What are you talkin' about?

25:28.329 --> 25:30.197
All of the prisons are doin' it.

25:30.598 --> 25:32.533
They're kickin' the non-violents
back out on the streets,

25:32.533 --> 25:34.435
and makin' room for
the tent dwellers.

25:35.169 --> 25:38.406
Let's see how long it takes for
the non-violent to get violent.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.541
- All right, thank you.
- All right.

25:45.179 --> 25:46.414
Did you hear that?

25:46.747 --> 25:47.682
I did.

25:47.682 --> 25:48.883
Jesus Christ,
it's gonna be

25:48.883 --> 25:50.151
a goddamn mess out there, Mariam.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.986
This kid is part of the problem.

25:51.986 --> 25:53.521
We let him off last week.

25:53.921 --> 25:54.889
And what'd he do?

25:55.489 --> 25:57.725
Went out and did it again,
only used a goddamn gun.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.161
I, I, I just wanna talk to him.

26:00.161 --> 26:01.495
Yeah, well,
you'll talk to him.

26:01.495 --> 26:03.397
You'll talk to a whole group
of them, like you do.

26:03.397 --> 26:05.166
Well, I wanna
talk to Marco.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.301
Mariam, it's not gonna work
like that.

26:07.301 --> 26:09.737
I pulled strings to
get you in here.

26:09.737 --> 26:11.472
And besides, this kid's
not gonna wanna talk to

26:11.472 --> 26:13.874
the lady that he jumped
last week, all right?

26:14.208 --> 26:16.644
Mariam, I know it sounds shitty.

26:16.944 --> 26:18.346
But honestly, I mean,

26:18.346 --> 26:20.247
he's not even gonna remember
what you look like.

26:23.017 --> 26:25.152
Yeah.
Okay.

26:41.202 --> 26:42.737
Hello.

26:46.173 --> 26:48.376
Um...

26:49.710 --> 26:54.715
I thought maybe we could just
talk between ourselves.

26:55.082 --> 26:57.985
If anybody has anything to say...

27:02.156 --> 27:03.424
No, no.
Of course not.

27:03.424 --> 27:04.625
Well, I'll go first.

27:04.625 --> 27:07.094
Okay, so...
I'm Mariam McLusky.

27:07.728 --> 27:11.232
I moved to Kingstown when
I married,

27:11.232 --> 27:13.300
and my husband had a job here.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.969
And we had three sons.

27:15.636 --> 27:19.774
I've been working in prisons,
oh, for almost 50 years now.

27:19.774 --> 27:22.576
But I've never worked in
juvenile before.

27:22.977 --> 27:24.378
So, this is a first.

27:26.681 --> 27:29.316
When my boys were
about your age,

27:29.316 --> 27:31.986
their father was shot and killed
in a drive-by.

27:33.020 --> 27:35.489
Then, last year,
my oldest son...

27:36.457 --> 27:38.793
was shot and killed in
a robbery.

27:38.793 --> 27:40.661
And I just sort of...

27:41.395 --> 27:43.064
filled up with rage.

27:43.664 --> 27:45.933
I took it out a lot on
my middle boy.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.869
But really, I was just angry...

27:50.271 --> 27:51.539
with the world.

27:52.840 --> 27:57.378
And I wonder if any of you can...

27:58.279 --> 28:00.448
My pop was killed on
our front porch

28:00.448 --> 28:02.850
outside of our house while
I was doing homework.

28:02.850 --> 28:04.318
- She say talk?
- Oh, yes.

28:04.318 --> 28:06.887
Oh, I want them to talk.
Thank you.

28:07.288 --> 28:10.558
But they can talk.
Please, go on.

28:11.726 --> 28:13.394
That's all I've got to say.

28:15.029 --> 28:16.330
What's your name?

28:17.631 --> 28:18.632
Jacob.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.367
Fuckin' killed my baby sister

28:20.367 --> 28:22.002
right outside
her goddamn school.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.938
Caught up in some bullshit.

28:25.439 --> 28:27.842
No trial, no protests,
no nothin'.

28:29.610 --> 28:31.879
Why you here, anyway?
I know who you are.

28:32.179 --> 28:33.514
I know who your son is.

28:36.784 --> 28:37.685
Well...

28:37.685 --> 28:39.720
Last month, in the prison riot,

28:40.020 --> 28:42.356
both my boys were trapped inside
the prison

28:42.356 --> 28:43.791
when it was on fire,

28:43.791 --> 28:47.361
and I didn't think that I would
ever see them again.

28:48.529 --> 28:50.331
And when they walked out...

28:52.666 --> 28:56.370
something inside of me
just cracked wide open.

28:57.338 --> 29:01.275
And it's like all the...

29:01.275 --> 29:03.577
rage leaked out.

29:04.478 --> 29:09.517
And what was left was thankfulness.

29:10.251 --> 29:11.719
Then last week, I was mugged,

29:11.719 --> 29:14.555
and the boy punched me and
he threw me down,

29:14.555 --> 29:16.390
but he didn't break anything.

29:17.191 --> 29:18.759
And...

29:19.226 --> 29:20.661
He just took my cash.

29:21.595 --> 29:25.099
He left me my photos,
and my wallet, my bag.

29:27.835 --> 29:30.805
And I don't know,
I guess I'm just still...

29:32.807 --> 29:33.841
thankful.

32:55.484 --> 32:57.052
Hey, shit is poppin' off

No, I can't.

I...

33:26.214 --> 33:28.650
Yeah, I got somethin' that
you wanna see, man.

33:29.885 --> 33:32.321
We gotta figure out a play
before Chief gets wind of it.

33:33.155 --> 33:34.690
All right, I'll come in tomorrow.

33:34.690 --> 33:36.325

33:39.394 --> 33:41.563

What have you got?

34:08.090 --> 34:09.391
Look.

34:10.492 --> 34:13.328
Lady said her husband dug up
a box of these at his work site.

34:13.996 --> 34:15.230
Where is this box?

34:15.230 --> 34:16.198
Lock up.

34:16.198 --> 34:17.566
She threw 'em in
a fuckin' gym bag.

34:17.566 --> 34:18.834
Jesus Christ.

34:18.834 --> 34:19.901
I couldn't just
fuckin' leave 'em

34:19.901 --> 34:21.136
sittin' out there, man.

34:21.703 --> 34:23.405
Well, how many of these
does she have?

34:23.405 --> 34:24.706
I don't know.
A lot.

34:24.706 --> 34:26.775
Like, probably fuckin'
all of 'em.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.078
Fuck.

34:30.078 --> 34:32.047
Mike, I gotta know how deep
we're gonna go here with this.

34:32.047 --> 34:34.249
Look, we gotta keep 'em
out of the fuckin' system,

34:34.249 --> 34:35.150
first of all.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.551
Okay?
Can you buy me a minute?

34:36.551 --> 34:37.853
That's what I'm doin'.

34:38.854 --> 34:40.288
Anybody else know you got these?

34:40.656 --> 34:41.990
Just dropped in.

34:44.059 --> 34:45.761
So, what's up with this lady?

34:45.761 --> 34:47.362
She don't give a shit about
the bonds, man.

34:47.362 --> 34:49.197
She's just tryin' to protect
her husband.

34:49.197 --> 34:50.165
Where is he?

34:50.532 --> 34:51.533
Not sure, man.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.602
Okay, all right, look.

34:53.602 --> 34:55.370
Tell her that we're gonna
take care of the bonds, okay?

34:55.370 --> 34:57.939
And that she should go home
and wait for her husband.

34:57.939 --> 34:59.174
If he doesn't come back,

34:59.174 --> 35:01.043
she should find
a new fuckin' zip code.

35:01.843 --> 35:03.011
All right?
I gotta go.

35:03.011 --> 35:04.312

what's his.

35:06.381 --> 35:07.582

35:07.582 --> 35:09.117
Don't talk to anybody
about this shit.

35:11.486 --> 35:14.623
