00:10.477 --> 00:12.445
<i>the one thing</i>
<i>that could really affect it</i>

00:12.479 --> 00:14.280

00:19.719 --> 00:21.554
I got one!

00:21.588 --> 00:22.789
Ladies, ladies, please.

00:22.822 --> 00:24.290
I'm signing as fast as I can.

<i>When you took a bad picture, it</i>

yearbook pictures.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.532
Five by sevens,

Wallet size.
Hey, I'll frame it up for you.

<i>was find the right outfit.</i>

00:43.309 --> 00:45.178
<i>I really wanted to look good.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:48.448
<i>The problem was, my mother</i>
<i>wanted me to look good too.</i>

00:48.481 --> 00:49.582
Chris,

00:49.616 --> 00:52.652
I got your outfit
for picture day.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.622

Oh, Chris, you look sharp.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.296
I look stupid.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.431
How come I have to wear
Drew's old stuff?

01:38.465 --> 01:40.633
Oh, baby, I had to buy
Drew a new pair of pants

01:40.667 --> 01:43.470
and Tonya a new pair of shoes
for their school pictures.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.605
What's wrong?
You look fine.

01:45.638 --> 01:48.408
NARRATOR:
<i>My father thought</i>
<i>any clothes were good clothes</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:50.477
<i>Well, that's 'cause</i>
<i>he didn't have matching socks</i>

01:50.510 --> 01:52.612
<i>till he was 29.</i>
I look like an idiot.

01:52.645 --> 01:55.315
Baby, you do not look
like an idiot to me.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.618
NARRATOR:
<i>That'd be great if I was two.</i>

01:58.651 --> 02:00.587
Well, can I please
wear something else?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.389
Long as I don't
have to pay for it.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.623
Just find
something to wear

02:03.656 --> 02:05.358
and I'll take
a look at it, okay?

02:05.392 --> 02:06.760
I don't have
anything special.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.362
When I was a kid,
we didn't need special clothes.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.398
Just having clothes was special.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.834
NARRATOR:
<i>The only way I was gonna get</i>
<i>my mother to spend money on me</i>

02:14.868 --> 02:17.237
<i>was if not doing it</i>
<i>would embarrass her.</i>

02:17.270 --> 02:19.572
Mom, I'm the only black kid
in the whole school.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.508
They already think
I'm a crack baby.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.477
Wearing this sweater, they'll
probably think I'm on welfare.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.579
Who said we were on welfare?

02:26.613 --> 02:28.915
Be home from school
on time tomorrow.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.517
We're gonna
go shopping.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.719
I thought you said
we didn't have the money.

02:32.752 --> 02:33.987
Oh, I'll get it.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.789
Or they'll think
that we on welfare.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.757
NARRATOR:
<i>If people thought</i>
<i>we were homeless,</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:39.726
<i>I could've got</i>
<i>some leather socks.</i>

02:39.759 --> 02:41.795
<i>When my mother couldn't get</i>
<i>any business to hire her,</i>

02:41.828 --> 02:43.863
<i>she would start</i>
<i>her own business from home.</i>

02:43.897 --> 02:47.701
The secret to success
in selling Yvonne cosmetics

02:47.734 --> 02:49.235
is in attitude.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.837
Now, when I started
selling Yvonne,

02:50.870 --> 02:52.572
I was like
a lot of you.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.475
I was raising my kids,
doing housework

02:55.508 --> 02:59.012
and wondering
where I went wrong. But since,

02:59.045 --> 03:02.449
I've divorced my husband,
my kids moved in with my mother,

03:02.482 --> 03:05.018
and just last month
I won an award:

03:05.051 --> 03:08.555
the Yvonne yellow
Buick Riviera.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.524
Wait. So how can
we make money again?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.859
Well, you do like me.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.428
You sell your products
to women like yourself,

03:15.462 --> 03:17.764
then they sell them
to women like them.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.966
Now, isn't that
the pyramid scheme?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.968
Oh, no. Of course not.

03:22.002 --> 03:25.739
We use the triangulated
vertical integration model,

03:25.772 --> 03:27.907
or TVI for short.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.543
TVIs work from
the bottom up.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.046
This is your business, ladies.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.281
There is no one
below you.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.916
So that means
we're at the top.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.952
No, you're at the bottom.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.921
But that's as high
as you can go.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.890
Count me in.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.425
Me too.
Yeah, girl.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.293
We're gonna make some money.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.562
NARRATOR:
<i>While my mother</i>
<i>was keeping it together,</i>

03:49.596 --> 03:51.297
<i>Tonya was tearing things apart.</i>

03:51.331 --> 03:53.667
You broke my car?
It fell.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.734
It didn't just fall.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.469
What were you doing
in here anyway?

03:56.503 --> 03:58.872
I was trying to see if my doll
could ride in it.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.006
It's a model car.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.675
Nobody's supposed to fit in it.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.877
It's just a stupid car,
Drew.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.780
Say you're sorry.
I ain't saying nothing.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.783
NARRATOR:
<i>Drew was a pretty nice guy,</i>
<i>but if you crossed him,</i>

04:09.816 --> 04:12.585

It's all right.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.854
NARRATOR:
<i>Translation:</i>
<i>You done messed up.</i>

04:18.892 --> 04:20.427
What's all this?

04:20.460 --> 04:22.028
Yvonne cosmetics.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.596
I'm gonna be a sales rep.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.765
You're not working
from home again, are you?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.734
NARRATOR:
<i>My father hated</i>
<i>when my mother</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:29.636
<i>went into business</i>
<i>for herself.</i>

04:29.669 --> 04:31.604
I know it's January, sir,

04:31.638 --> 04:34.407
but candy corn is not just
for Halloween anymore.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.376
NARRATOR:
<i>She ran up the phone bill.</i>

04:36.409 --> 04:37.777
<i>She put my father to work.</i>

04:37.811 --> 04:40.413
What you mean you got to
put it together yourself?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.916
Shh! What size
shoe you wear?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.784
NARRATOR:
<i>And she was always eating.</i>

04:44.818 --> 04:47.354
Well, Supperware
is just like Tupperware,

04:47.387 --> 04:48.822
except it's for us.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.890
How much does
all of this cost?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.959
$75.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.661
Where'd you get $75?

04:54.694 --> 04:56.563
From our savings account.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.599
How are we supposed to save
if you keep taking money out?

04:59.632 --> 05:02.502
I need money to buy a new outfit
for Chris's picture day.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.938
But if you don't think
that I can do it, then fine.

NARRATOR:
<i>Translation: How come</i>

05:08.174 --> 05:09.776
It's not that. I--

05:09.809 --> 05:12.579
I just don't want all these
women hanging out over here,

05:12.612 --> 05:15.548
running their mouth, eating
our food and wasting your time.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.684
It's not gonna be
a waste of time.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.119
All right.

NARRATOR:
<i>Meanwhile, Drew</i>
<i>was getting revenge,</i>

05:21.654 --> 05:23.156
<i>and Tonya couldn't tell how.</i>

05:23.189 --> 05:24.824
What are you
doing in my room?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.460
Are you gonna say sorry? Okay.
No.

something new for picture day.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.438
Man, you should try again.

Come on, man,
it's like Billy Idol.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.975
It's just hair gel.
Yeah, but on picture day,

05:42.008 --> 05:43.943
aren't you supposed
to look like...

05:43.977 --> 05:45.478
I don't know... You?

05:45.512 --> 05:46.980
It was either this
or Boy George.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.816
Boy George? Man, the girls
would have been all over you.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.585
What about for your picture?
You do anything special?

05:52.619 --> 05:54.788
My mom's taking me shopping
for a new outfit.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.990
Get out. What are you gonna get?
I don't know.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.959
Anything that does not have
a big red fire truck on it.

Nice hair. You waiting

Thank you. Uh, we're
looking for an outfit.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.618
With the right outfit,
you can beat any charge.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.020
I'm not charged with anything.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.690

It's so cool. I have
a suede-front shirt.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.697
You got Chris a suede shirt?

07:43.730 --> 07:44.998
I don't even
have suede shoes.

a suede shirt cost?

Huh?

Your shoes. Your brand-new

08:06.619 --> 08:08.321
One is missing.
Where's the other one?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.290
Wish I could afford
to lose a shoe.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.126
Drew took it.

No, I didn't.

NARRATOR:
<i>The only way Tonya</i>
<i>could tell on Drew</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:19.265
<i>was if she told on herself.</i>

08:19.299 --> 08:20.900
<i>So she had a choice to make,</i>

08:20.934 --> 08:23.803
<i>and it kinda made her</i>
<i>feel like this...</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:26.306

<i>Three hours later, Tonya set</i>
<i>his Voltron robot on fire.</i>

18:31.678 --> 18:35.515
Oh, Julius!
look at your baby girl.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.485
She's so...
JULIUS: She looks so good!

18:38.518 --> 18:39.753
[GASPS]

18:39.786 --> 18:42.455
Look at my handsome man!

18:42.489 --> 18:44.758
Oh, you are just too fine
for words.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.459
Look at him, Julius.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.962
Look at that, how cute he is.
Aw, man, so handsome.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.897
Chris, where's
your pictures?

18:50.930 --> 18:53.767
NARRATOR:
<i>I hadn't told my mother</i>
<i>about the school picture.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:56.636
<i>But when they arrived,</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

18:56.670 --> 18:59.939
Now, before you look
at the picture,

18:59.973 --> 19:01.574
I have to tell you
something.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.842
What?

19:02.876 --> 19:05.412
Somebody stole my clothes.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.213
Somebody stole your clothes?

19:07.247 --> 19:10.283
Why in the world would somebody
steal your clothes, boy?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.353
I got one!

19:13.386 --> 19:15.889
Ladies, ladies, please,
I'm signing as fast as I can.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.357
Doyle only has one hand.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.360
I don't think
you're gonna like them.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.929
Chris, even if I don't
like the pictures,

19:22.962 --> 19:24.931
it's not the end
of the world.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.334
You are a handsome
young man,

19:27.367 --> 19:29.369
and I love you
either way, baby, okay?

19:29.402 --> 19:31.604
It cannot be
that bad.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.341
NARRATOR:
<i>Every now and again,</i>
<i>my mother made me feel</i>

19:34.374 --> 19:36.576
<i>like I wasn't the biggest nerd</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

19:36.609 --> 19:38.445
<i>And for a moment,</i>
<i>I actually felt</i>

19:38.478 --> 19:40.947
<i>like the picture didn't matter.</i>

19:41.781 --> 19:43.583
A lawn jockey?

19:43.616 --> 19:46.786
You took your pictures
dressed as a lawn jockey?

19:46.820 --> 19:49.356
What, they've run out
of monkey suits?

19:49.389 --> 19:54.627
<i>* Everybody hates Chris </i>

19:56.563 --> 19:59.632
