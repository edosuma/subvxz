WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.268
(man on TV)
'Thank you, Spiro.'

00:03.270 --> 00:04.803
'So come and share
in the splendor'

00:04.805 --> 00:07.172
'of Navajo Meadows timeshares.'

00:07.174 --> 00:09.174
'Just 30 minutes
from Broken Hole'

00:09.176 --> 00:11.844
'but a world away
from your cares.'

00:13.781 --> 00:15.614
[applauding]

00:15.616 --> 00:19.718
How about that Spiro Agnew?
Isn't he great?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.154
Yes. And so versatile.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.590
So, what do you say now,
Willie, Kate?

00:24.592 --> 00:30.095
Are you committed to the concept
of timeshare condominium living?

00:30.097 --> 00:32.431
(both)
No.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.833
Maybe if we took one more
look at the video.

00:34.835 --> 00:38.070
No. No, please, no more.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.738
Excuse me, would you?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.242
- Harry.
- Mm-hmm?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.877
Put the pen away.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.749
Imagine that.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.685
We could be neighbors
with Spiro Agnew!

00:55.790 --> 00:59.324
Think about it. Don't you have
a lot of questions?

01:00.628 --> 01:03.962
The only thing I have
is an overwhelming desire

01:03.964 --> 01:07.733
to get the people
you invited out of this house.

01:07.735 --> 01:12.838
Okay, okay. But don't let them
leave before you get the prize.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.573
I feel it this time.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.376
You're gonna win us
that Chevy Blazer.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.814
Nobody wins the Chevy Blazer.

01:21.816 --> 01:26.552
That's what R. L. Smith
of South Carolina used to think.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.289
[theme music]

01:57.918 --> 02:00.519
[music continues]

02:28.983 --> 02:30.983
[instrumental music]

02:33.554 --> 02:36.722
Yes, I'm canceling
that appointment.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.258
Well, I don't feel
that I have any use

02:39.260 --> 02:43.061
for a home flotation tank.

02:43.063 --> 02:47.766
I suppose I do sound like
I could use one. Goodbye.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.869
ALF, are you sure that's all
the appointments you set up?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.204
Yeah, yeah.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.340
You know you just blew our shot
at winning the round trip

02:55.342 --> 02:57.876
on the Fun Bus to Vegas?

02:59.146 --> 03:02.414
If I told you once,
I told you a thousand times.

03:02.416 --> 03:06.018
You're not to invite salesmen
into the house!

03:06.020 --> 03:09.388
Well, it is funny
how that hasn't sunk in yet.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.191
Why do you suppose that is?

03:12.193 --> 03:15.027
Because you don't listen.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.029
No, that's not it.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.265
I have to punish you.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.468
Should I assume the position?

03:23.470 --> 03:26.538
Go to the attic until we decide
what to do with you.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.975
- No.
- No? What do you mean, no?

03:29.977 --> 03:34.079
I mean I'm not going.
What do you think about that?

03:34.081 --> 03:36.715
Ooh. Your turn, dad.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.684
As long as
you're living under this roof

03:38.686 --> 03:40.552
you'll do
what we tell you to do.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.888
Well, in that case,
I'm out of here.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.592
I'm hitting the bricks.
I'm history, I'm vapor.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.761
Yeah, sure.
We've heard that before.

03:49.763 --> 03:53.198
Yeah. Well, not another day
under tyranny's heavy thumb.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.934
Goodbye, Willie.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.704
Goodbye, Kate.
Goodbye, children.

03:58.706 --> 04:02.374
I think I shall miss you
most of all.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.143
Yeah. Okay, go.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.814
We'll warn you just before
the automatic sprinklers go on.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.084
Don't bother.
This time I mean it.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.756
If there's one thing that alien
has learned in his time on Earth

04:17.758 --> 04:20.659
it's how to make an exit.

04:20.661 --> 04:26.064
(ALF)
'Oh, lordy, lordy,
I'm free at last!'

04:26.066 --> 04:27.199
[door closes]

04:27.201 --> 04:28.600
See?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.604
[instrumental music]

04:34.441 --> 04:36.108
There he is. I can see him.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.643
Where? I don't see anything.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.645
See that shadow
right by the garage?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.446
If he thinks
I'm gonna give in to him again

04:41.448 --> 04:43.982
he's got another thing coming.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.753
Well, no matter what,
the sprinklers come on at 9:30.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.856
And you know how musty
he smells when he's wet.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.993
I'll get my jacket.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.697
[instrumental music]

05:05.372 --> 05:07.973
Oh. Well, that settles it.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.842
I am my own worst enemy.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.577
I could be watching
"Beauty And The Beast"

05:12.579 --> 05:14.579
right now.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.281
What I wouldn't give to
have a great setup

05:16.283 --> 05:17.983
in a sewer like that.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.486
Wait a minute.

05:21.488 --> 05:26.158
If I go back now,
they'll never take me seriously.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.194
But they never did take me
seriously.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.929
Why, I ought to..

05:32.266 --> 05:34.399
I'm out of here.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.634
(Willie)
ALF?

05:37.237 --> 05:38.670
ALF?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.107
Hey, ALF?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.943
[sprinklers sputtering]

05:44.945 --> 05:47.179
Oh, no.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.052
[instrumental music]

05:57.991 --> 06:00.759
- Oh, honey. You're soaked.
- No kidding.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.796
Where's ALF?
Wasn't he out there?

06:04.798 --> 06:09.434
No, no, the, uh, the shadow
turned out to be a lawn chair.

06:09.436 --> 06:14.906
And that's the last time a lawn
chair is going to disobey me.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.944
Well, you know,
he's never carried it

06:18.946 --> 06:22.214
to this extreme before.
I hope he's okay.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.849
He'll be okay, he'll be fine.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.719
As long as he stays quiet,
maintains a low profile

06:27.721 --> 06:29.955
stays out of trouble..

06:29.957 --> 06:31.022
[sighs]

06:31.024 --> 06:32.057
He's dead.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.563
[instrumental music]

06:40.334 --> 06:43.735
And this was my grandmother's
snowstorm paperweight.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.939
See, when you shake it,
it snows.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.141
Whoa.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.344
So she left you
the bulk of her estate, huh?

06:52.346 --> 06:54.012
[glass shatters]

06:55.949 --> 06:59.184
- Oh.
- That was an accident. I swear.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.786
I was nowhere near it.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.922
Um....that's okay, ALF.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.591
I still have the box it came in.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.560
These things happen.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.362
Really?

07:10.364 --> 07:12.631
What else you got?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.400
Willie sounded awfully mad
on the phone.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.803
What did you two fight about?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.371
What's it always about?

07:19.373 --> 07:21.907
I just invited
some people over to talk about

07:21.909 --> 07:25.410
timeshare living in New Mexico.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.212
Ooh, timeshares.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.282
- Did they bring pamphlets?
- Yeah.

07:30.284 --> 07:35.554
They were like Jehovah's
Witnesses, only with prizes.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.689
ALF, I'm awfully glad
you're here.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.491
I was hoping
I'd get a chance to talk to you

07:39.493 --> 07:41.626
about your amazing life.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.862
Well, what do you wanna know?

07:43.864 --> 07:47.566
Well, how far away was Melmac?

07:47.568 --> 07:50.869
Well, that's a toughie.
In feet?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.505
Pretty far, I guess.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.408
Well, what solar system
is it in?

07:56.410 --> 07:58.677
I don't know.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.146
This may be a good time
to tell you

08:01.148 --> 08:03.114
I was a P.E. major.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.550
[doorbell rings]

08:05.552 --> 08:07.686
- 'It's me, Willie.'
- Oh, great.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.188
The fun police have arrived.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.995
Hey, Willie. You didn't
have to come rushing over.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.632
I can't believe
you'd run off like that.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.068
You know how worried we were?

08:23.070 --> 08:27.873
Neal, I'm sorry to burden you
with our burden.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.975
Well, that's alright.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.576
Actually,
we were having a good time.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.645
He's a pretty fun guy.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.914
Then you should see me
in a dress.

08:35.916 --> 08:40.285
In a white wig I look
exactly like Estelle Getty.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.989
I guess that's pretty obvious,
though, huh?

08:43.991 --> 08:47.993
Come on, ALF, let's go.
You're still not off the hook.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.662
Oh, yeah, the beating.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.164
Willie!

08:53.166 --> 08:55.700
Well, that's ridiculous.
I never touched him.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.636
But you want to, don't you?

08:57.638 --> 08:59.404
Huh? Huh? Huh?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.941
Come on. Let's go.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.380
Willie, he's shaking.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.883
It's a ploy. Stop it.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.558
You know, Willie,
it might not be so bad

09:19.560 --> 09:21.860
if you let ALF stay with me
for a while.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.029
Give us a chance
to get to know each other

09:24.031 --> 09:26.765
and Lord knows you two can use
some time apart.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.368
I don't think you really know
what spending time

09:30.370 --> 09:33.405
with ALF can mean.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.374
Willie, hey, don't make him beg.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.209
He's already agreed.

09:39.846 --> 09:43.381
I guess I could talk
Kate into it.

09:43.383 --> 09:47.686
But, uh, you're gonna need
a reliable fire extinguisher

09:47.688 --> 09:50.989
and fresh batteries
for your smoke detector.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.059
You gotta put 9-1-1
on speed dialing.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.795
Trust me,
you'll need the time.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.496
Make out your will

09:58.498 --> 10:02.734
and other than that,
hey, have fun.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.302
Thanks, Willie.

10:04.304 --> 10:08.273
Lordy, lordy,
I'm free at last.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.443
Don't hate me.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.417
[instrumental music]

10:19.419 --> 10:24.522
(woman on phone)
'So, Thor, I never heard you
on the party line before.'

10:24.524 --> 10:26.491
'Tell me about yourself.'

10:26.493 --> 10:28.860
Well, I'm pretty average.

10:28.862 --> 10:33.331
I'm 6'5 with rippling abs.

10:33.333 --> 10:37.335
But enough about me.
What are your stats, babe?

10:37.337 --> 10:42.741
(woman on phone)
'Well, I'm 5'8, have dimples,
azure-blue eyes'

10:42.743 --> 10:45.977
'long, blond hair,
and perfectly shaped--'

10:45.979 --> 10:49.814
Oh, come on.
I was honest with you.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.784
Hello?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.419
Hello?

10:54.421 --> 10:55.854
Touchy.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.591
- Hi, ALF.
- 'Hi.'

10:59.593 --> 11:02.160
Oh, ALF..

11:03.797 --> 11:06.064
I thought
you were gonna clean up.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.633
I did.
Nice of you to notice.

11:08.635 --> 11:12.003
That beer-can pyramid?
Gone.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.908
Oh, ALF, what happened
to the window?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.877
It's been broken for days.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.979
You could just see it now.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.449
[Neal sighs]

11:24.451 --> 11:27.519
Did you call the electrician
about Apartment 16?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.789
You were serious about that?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.391
I thought you were kidding.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.528
Why would I be kidding
about an electrician?

11:36.530 --> 11:40.832
I don't know. It didn't seem
very funny to me, either.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.134
I'll do it tomorrow.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.371
Look, ALF, I don't wanna
sound insensitive

11:46.373 --> 11:49.307
but it has been a week
and I thought we agreed that

11:49.309 --> 11:51.443
while you were here
you'd help out.

11:51.445 --> 11:54.813
Well, I'm following
the spirit of that agreement.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.981
[yawns]
Now I need a nap.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.850
[doorbell rings]

11:58.852 --> 12:00.051
Oh, uh..

12:00.053 --> 12:03.655
Quick, uh, go to the bathroom.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.290
Okay.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.527
Now what?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.862
Oh..

12:10.864 --> 12:14.999
Oh, chill out.
I knew what you meant. Ha!

12:20.874 --> 12:23.208
[gasps]
Mrs. Watson.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.043
How are you today?
How's every little thing?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.746
Hello, Mr. Tanner.
May I come in?

12:27.748 --> 12:31.049
Oh, gee, do you have to?

12:31.051 --> 12:35.053
I guess I could reprimand you
in the hall.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.989
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.459
Look at this place.

12:43.864 --> 12:48.566
Um, I don't have an answer
for that. I-I wish I did.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.971
We've had a lot of complaints
about you

12:52.973 --> 12:54.906
from the other tenants.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.241
You have?

12:59.546 --> 13:01.012
I'm afraid so.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.215
But I told them, he's new,
he's down on his luck

13:04.217 --> 13:07.652
his wife threw him out,
and he's a little pathetic.

13:07.654 --> 13:11.456
Well, thank you.
I appreciate your kind words.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.292
I hired you
because I felt sorry for you.

13:14.294 --> 13:19.998
But even so, sinks have to flow,
toilets have to flush.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.833
That's the way the world works.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.601
Well, uh, there's a lovely

13:23.603 --> 13:25.670
simple wisdom in that,
Mrs. Watson.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.206
And I promise I'll do better.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.210
Please, just remember why you
hired me in the first place.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.712
Don't test me, Mr. Tanner.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.349
Being pathetic will only get you
so far in life.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.224
Don't worry about her.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.760
We're gonna
get through this together.

13:48.762 --> 13:51.863
What, do you think you can get
to some of those phone calls?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.965
Don't test me, Mr. Tanner.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.237
Oh, lighten up, Neal. Ha, ha!

13:59.840 --> 14:01.339
Ha..

14:05.812 --> 14:07.912
[scatting]

14:07.914 --> 14:10.315
¶ Tutti frutti oh Rudy ¶

14:10.317 --> 14:12.717
¶ Tutti frutti oh Rudy ¶

14:12.719 --> 14:14.953
¶ Tutti frutti oh Rudy ¶

14:14.955 --> 14:17.288
¶ Tutti frutti oh Rudy ¶

14:17.290 --> 14:18.823
¶ Tutti frutti oh Rudy ¶

14:18.825 --> 14:20.358
ALF!

14:20.360 --> 14:21.993
[scatting]

14:21.995 --> 14:24.128
- ALF!
- Hey, Neal.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.165
Come on, let's party
till the cows come home.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.634
By the way,
when do they come home?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.536
I don't mind
that they're out late

14:31.538 --> 14:35.206
what bothers me is
they don't call.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.708
¶ Yeah what you do to me ¶

14:36.710 --> 14:38.142
¶ Tutti frutti ¶¶

14:38.144 --> 14:40.411
[banging on wall]

14:41.781 --> 14:43.214
Oh, no.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.850
How long have the neighbors been
banging on the walls?

14:45.852 --> 14:48.052
Well, my guess would be
all night.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.422
And frankly, I find it annoying.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.591
ALF, about this roommate
situation, I just don't--

14:53.593 --> 14:58.096
I know, I know,
I'm a little out of control

14:58.098 --> 15:01.766
but that's because
I'm young and foolhardy.

15:01.768 --> 15:06.671
I've always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.241
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.777
I don't hate you!

15:12.779 --> 15:16.214
But you do have to
learn a little consideration

15:16.216 --> 15:18.082
for other people.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.918
[knocking on door]

15:19.920 --> 15:21.252
(male #1)
'Police officers.'

15:21.254 --> 15:23.354
'Would you open the door,
please?'

15:23.356 --> 15:26.090
And you have the nerve
to lecture me.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.597
[instrumental music]

15:35.101 --> 15:37.969
I'm sure I heard something.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.671
Honey, what if it's a burglar?

15:39.673 --> 15:43.007
Don't worry, honey.
I've got the lamp.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.609
[screams]

15:46.379 --> 15:49.914
Oh. Hi, Willie. Hi, Kate.

15:49.916 --> 15:53.184
Oh. Neal, what are
you doing here?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.920
I couldn't sleep at my house.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.089
- ALF?
- Where?

15:59.993 --> 16:03.461
It's okay. It's-it's okay.
You're with friends now.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.097
Willie, I tried.
I tried reasoning.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.699
I asked nicely.

16:07.701 --> 16:11.936
How do you handle him?
How do you afford him?

16:11.938 --> 16:16.274
Well, Kate's working now
and we're on our third mortgage.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.177
We're desperately hoping
that Lynn'll marry well.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.780
Hi, Uncle Neal. Are you okay?

16:22.782 --> 16:25.350
He will be.
Just take deep breaths, Neal.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.086
That's-that's what
we always did at first.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.254
Oh, does this mean
ALF is coming home?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.457
No. No.
Now, don't get you hopes up.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.891
Maybe they're not done
bonding yet.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.095
Have you tried, Neal?
I mean really, really.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.563
We're done.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.897
I mean, don't get me wrong.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.066
He's a nice little guy.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.069
We've actually had
some nice conversations.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.739
But I want him out of my house!

16:49.909 --> 16:52.110
I'm sorry.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.146
I haven't slept in four days.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.482
Or was it nine?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.484
Neal, calm down.
Just relax.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.653
Can I get you some coffee,
uh, decaf?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.356
- Maybe a glass of warm milk?
- Okay.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.727
- With a flex straw?
- I'll see if we have any.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.928
[sighs]

17:10.930 --> 17:12.964
Willie, it's awful.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.833
I don't know if he does
these things on purpose or what.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.702
Oh.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.670
He does.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.707
We just haven't been
able to prove it.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.378
Neal, why don't you
do something about it?

17:27.380 --> 17:31.015
I'll be right behind you
when you tell him.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.217
Why should I tell him?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.820
Because you know
how I hate confrontation.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.623
Neal, it's time you started
to assert yourself.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.125
Stop letting people
walk all over you.

17:41.127 --> 17:44.762
You know, sometimes true bonding
comes after great crisis.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.833
- Maybe--
- Kate, give it up. It's over.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.435
[sighs]

17:50.437 --> 17:52.870
Just when I started to dream
in color again.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.810
[instrumental music]

18:13.126 --> 18:14.826
[gasps]

18:14.828 --> 18:17.562
Oh, good Lord, he's dead.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.666
No, he's just full.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.503
ALF.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.106
ALF, it's Willie.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.442
Willie. Willie Aames?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.011
How's it going, bro?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.415
Charles.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.017
Shouldn't you be
watching the girls?

18:40.019 --> 18:43.754
He's delirious.
We've gotta get him on his feet.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.189
It won't be pretty.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.859
Say, you don't have a couple of
rain slickers around, do you?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.829
I'm afraid not.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.632
Hey, ALF,
you've gotta get up, ALF.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.766
Huh? Yeah.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.668
- Listen, can you hear me?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.839
ALF, Neal has something
that he wants to say to you.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.241
Sure.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.009
N-Neal.

19:05.011 --> 19:09.981
ALF, it's, uh, it's about
our living arrangement, ALF.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.383
Ah..

19:12.385 --> 19:15.219
[burping]

19:15.221 --> 19:16.854
Whew.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.090
[burping]

19:19.092 --> 19:23.594
You know, he has eight stomachs.
This-this could take some time.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.096
[sighs]

19:25.098 --> 19:26.998
You were saying?

19:27.000 --> 19:31.602
[sighs]
ALF, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to, uh..

19:32.872 --> 19:34.238
...to leave, ALF.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.506
Now, don't take this
as a rejection.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.509
I-I just couldn't handle that.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.745
You're throwing me out?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.446
<i> Moi?</i>

19:42.448 --> 19:45.650
I'm aghast.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.119
You. You're behind all this!

19:48.121 --> 19:50.988
You poisoned him against me.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.492
I didn't have to do a thing.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.595
I'm sorry, ALF.
It's just not working out.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.964
Oh.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.901
Well, in that case,
thanks for my wonderful time.

20:03.903 --> 20:08.005
[Neal sighs]
Aw, ALF, you don't have to leave
right this second.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.708
Why don't you take your time
and you can..

20:14.180 --> 20:15.780
Get out.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.617
Okay, okay.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.954
Warm up the wagon, Willie.
We're heading home.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.156
I think
that's the right decision.

20:25.158 --> 20:28.492
I'll bring the car around front.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.761
I hope you're not mad at me.

20:30.763 --> 20:34.765
No. It couldn't have been
an easy thing for you to do.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.102
We can still be friends, right?

20:38.104 --> 20:41.806
Sure.
We'll always have Paris.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.977
Well..

20:45.979 --> 20:47.445
...bye, ALF.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.914
Aw, come over here, you lug.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.849
Oh.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.284
[burps]

20:53.286 --> 20:55.653
Thanks.
You moved the bubble.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.789
Catch you around town, bro.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.458
[laughs]

21:00.460 --> 21:03.728
[burps]
Oh, yeah, thanks. Wonderful.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.000
[instrumental music]

21:10.536 --> 21:13.104
I know you all missed me.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.505
Most of you.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.441
But please, no speeches.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.911
Katy.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.580
ALF-y.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.317
- Did you miss me?
- Need you even ask?

21:26.319 --> 21:28.586
Ah, me too.

21:28.588 --> 21:32.023
Come on, guys, I'm back.
Let's party.

21:32.025 --> 21:35.626
Hey, you, legs.
Get me a brewski.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.094
It's Lynn, ALF, and sorry

21:37.096 --> 21:39.330
you're not at
Uncle Neal's anymore.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.732
Oh, yeah. I'm home.

21:41.734 --> 21:46.570
Or as I affectionately
refer to it, the gulag.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.072
Speaking of which

21:48.074 --> 21:51.008
I believe you still have
a punishment to work out.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.679
- Oh, you're not still on that.
- Attic. Now.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.014
- But, Willie--
- Now!

21:57.016 --> 22:00.718
But I've always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.621
- Don't hate me because I'm--
- Attic!

22:04.857 --> 22:06.190
Tough house.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.599
[instrumental music]

22:41.994 --> 22:43.027
[laughs]
