00:01.560 --> 00:03.323
*

00:17.550 --> 00:19.575
CARY:
And does this abandoned pool

00:19.620 --> 00:20.769
belong to one
of your foreclosed properties?

00:20.820 --> 00:22.640
MAN:
It belongs to one
of the properties

00:22.690 --> 00:24.783
where the householder
could not repay his loan.

00:24.820 --> 00:27.357
And therefore,
we exercised our prerogative

00:27.390 --> 00:29.756
as the bank holding
the lease to foreclose.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.122
And this pool
at 233 Graham Court...

00:32.160 --> 00:33.252
WOMAN:
Can I interrupt here?

00:33.300 --> 00:36.167
It would saye us all a lot
of time to Just stipulate

00:36.200 --> 00:37.519
that the five swimming pools
are part

00:37.570 --> 00:38.696
of the foreclosure package
exercised

00:38.730 --> 00:40.163
by the Atlantic
Commerce Bank.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.337
Good. If you stipulate to that,

00:41.370 --> 00:42.701
it will save us time.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.708
I'll be right back.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.298
You okay, Kaley?

00:46.340 --> 00:48.171
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Gardner.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.677
How's it going?

00:49.710 --> 00:50.847
Pulling teeth.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.211
What's that?

00:52.250 --> 00:53.649
Notice of mediation.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.715
For?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.638
Both of us.
Wednesday.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.146
Why?

00:58.190 --> 00:59.657
The bankruptcy.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.385
We have another five weeks.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.559
I know.
We need 60 million
by February.

01:03.590 --> 01:04.852
And yet, one of
our creditors

01:04.890 --> 01:06.596
wants a mediation
on our progress.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.154
Which one?
I don't know.

01:11.770 --> 01:12.794
Check with Clarke.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.661
If we're being called
on the carpet, he is, too.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.305
Hmm. Wouldn't hurt to go in
with the 15 million

01:18.340 --> 01:20.137
from Atlantic Commerce.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.148
We went down to 13.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.204
It would be nice

01:23.250 --> 01:25.138
to keep that settlement
above ten.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.772
I'm doing my best.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.572
Counsel, please tell your client
to stop evading and answer.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.587
WOMAN:
Yes, after
you rephrase.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.508
Very simply, sir,
you foreclosed on these...

01:31.550 --> 01:33.313
The homeowners
neglected to pay.
You left these homes

01:33.360 --> 01:34.782
abandoned,
you left these pools...

01:34.820 --> 01:37.129
We did nothing.
These pools?
No, sir.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.229
After you kicked
the homeowners out,

01:38.260 --> 01:39.488
you did nothing
with the swimming pools.

01:39.530 --> 01:40.497
You let the water stagnate.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.521
The water was stagnant already.
And that water

01:42.570 --> 01:44.663
drew mosquitoes.
These mosquitoes, to be exact.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.895
And those mosquitoes carried
West Nile virus to my client,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.589
Kaley Spence.
WOMAN:
Oh, come on.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.766
Palsgraf v. Long
Island Railroad.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.368
There is no way that
Mr. Millam and his bank

01:51.410 --> 01:52.479
could_ know of this
prOXImate cause.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.307
WILL:
Good, then let your client
testify to that.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.503
_Because what I have here
IS a warning from the CDC

01:57.550 --> 01:58.608
mentioning your pools
as the culprit.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.311
We were not aware of that.
"We"?

02:00.350 --> 02:01.715
Are we speaking
for the whole bank here?

02:01.750 --> 02:03.718
I was not aware of that.
Well, were you aware

02:03.750 --> 02:05.240
of this_ letter_ of
complaint written

02:05.290 --> 02:07.258
by the neighbors,
including Mrs. Spence,

02:07.290 --> 02:10.418
about the declining conditions
of the foreclosed homes,

02:10.460 --> 02:11.688
including the pools?

02:11.730 --> 02:14.449
No. I was not aware of it.
You can see

02:14.500 --> 02:15.592
it was not addressed to me.
Yes.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.894
It was addressed to your
bank president, Wilkes Ingersol.

02:17.930 --> 02:22.139
Luckily,
that's who we're deposing next.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.472
* I love mountains,
I love rolling hills *

02:28.510 --> 02:32.913
* I love the flowers,
I love the daffodils *

02:32.950 --> 02:36.943
* I love_the fireside
when the lights are low *

02:36.990 --> 02:40.653
* Boom-dee-a-da, boom-dee—a-da,
boom-dee-a-da, boom...*

02:40.690 --> 02:42.555
WILL: _ _
It's up to you now, AIICIa.

02:42.590 --> 02:43.852
They sent it up the line

02:43.890 --> 02:45.221
to the bank president.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.727
I'm supposed to depose him
in ten minutes.

02:46.760 --> 02:47.749
How's Minnesota?

02:47.800 --> 02:48.926
Quiet.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.428
WILL:
Ask the president
if he ever saw the letter

02:51.470 --> 02:53.495
from the homeowners.
If he lies, we got them.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.290
They don't know
we have the notes

02:55.300 --> 02:57.439
Get his backtracking on record,
and we win.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.609
Okay. I'll call you back
in a few hours.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.937
* I love the ocean...

03:00.980 --> 03:03.244
Wow, look who's here.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.770
Everywhere I turn.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.813
Alicia. What _a
pleasant surprise.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.818
How's bankruptcy going?

03:09.850 --> 03:11.909
That which doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.259
Yeah, well, then you're
gonna be pretty strong.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.416
So, where are we?

03:15.460 --> 03:16.552
Uh, the business center.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.252
They got a business center here?

03:19.300 --> 03:22.428
For the record, I want
to restate our agreement.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.461
Mr. Ingersol's a busy man,
and he can only offer you

03:24.500 --> 03:26.297
three hours _for
your depOSItlon.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.490
After that, he has to
get back to his ranch.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.529
For his vacation?

03:29.570 --> 03:30.434
His working vacation.

03:30.470 --> 03:32.006
Chopping wood?
Milking cows?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.132
It's hard work.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.899
So, we're in agreement, Mrs.
Florrick, about three hours?

03:35.940 --> 03:37.703
If it's a true three hours, yes.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.638
And if you're in agreement
to have the judge

03:39.680 --> 03:41.545
on call
so that she can immediately

03:41.580 --> 03:43.548
settle any and all objections.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.217
Yes, of course.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.018
Are you getting cell
phone coverage here?

03:48.060 --> 03:49.527
IfI stand on my bed

03:49.560 --> 03:52.393
and put my arms
over my head.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.250
Okay, we're ready.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.562
So, the clock will start

03:56.600 --> 03:58.625
as soon as he walks
through that door.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.490
As soon as he sits
in that chair.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.303
Oh, let's not quibble.

04:02.340 --> 04:03.932
Good. Then the chair.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.978
MAN:
Wilkes Ingersol.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.046
I'm the president
of the Atlantic Commerce Bank,

04:11.080 --> 04:12.809
and a trustee
of the Mercantile Exchange.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.818
Well, it's nice to finally
meet you, Mr. Ingersol.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.488
You're a hard man to find.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.589
Really? Well...

04:17.620 --> 04:20.009
that's not
what my accountant says.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.948
(laughter)

04:21.990 --> 04:24.720
We've been trying to depose you
for 14 months now.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.523
CANNING:
Mrs. Florrick,
if you wanted

04:26.560 --> 04:27.629
to read that into the record,

04:27.660 --> 04:28.729
you could have done so
before Mr. Ingersol arrived.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.524
INGERSOL:
It's all right, Louis.
My apologies, ma'am.

04:31.570 --> 04:32.662
I don't mean to be flippant.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.066
Thank you for arranging
this deposition near my ranch.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.704
I hope you weren't
inconvenienced.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.832
I'm fine.

04:37.870 --> 04:41.772
Now, sir, if we could turn
to these foreclosed homes

04:41.810 --> 04:43.539
and their swimming pools...

04:43.580 --> 04:46.640
Yes. Um, could I say
something first?
Certainly, sir.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.477
I understand there are
a lot of homeowners

04:48.520 --> 04:49.885
who are underwater.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.549
I understand many homebuyers
were enticed into taking on

04:53.590 --> 04:55.979
adjustable mortgages that
eventually bankrupt them.

04:56.020 --> 04:58.488
But what I often think
is that banks

04:58.530 --> 05:00.589
are made the bad guys
in these equations,

05:00.630 --> 05:02.427
and that is unwarranted.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.495
Thank you, sir.
But what I
wholly condemn

05:04.530 --> 05:06.737
are any efforts to advance
political causes

05:06.770 --> 05:08.067
through legal means.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.601
I mean,
for example,

05:09.640 --> 05:11.062
uh, communities using
eminent domain

05:11.110 --> 05:12.771
to address bank foreclosures.

05:12.810 --> 05:17.577
Or here, using this painful
circumstance of a young child

05:17.610 --> 05:18.645
with West Nile virus

05:18.680 --> 05:20.739
to force us to change
our methods on foreclosures.

05:20.780 --> 05:24.011
I think you've been misinformed,
Mr. Ingersol.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.110
Kaley Spence is suing you
for $15 million.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.149
13 million.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.589
She's suing you because
she had a promising career

05:29.630 --> 05:31.086
as a ballet dancer,

05:31.130 --> 05:33.598
and now she needs
full-time care.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.621
We don't need the photos.
I think we do.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.797
INGERSOL:
Please leave them.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.798
She's a lovely girl.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.832
I have a 15-year-old daughter
myself.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.030
ALI_CIA:
SIr,

05:42.070 --> 05:44.459
did you see this letter,

05:44.510 --> 05:46.375
written by the residents
of the community complaining

05:46.410 --> 05:47.672
about the state
of these foreclosed homes?

05:47.710 --> 05:48.972
CANNING:
Objection.
We have no foundation

05:49.010 --> 05:50.409
for this letter.
ALICIA:
Mr. Canning, this is

05:50.450 --> 05:51.678
a deposition.
There's no need for foundation.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.644
That's not true, Mrs. Florrick,
and I won't have

05:53.680 --> 05:55.511
Mr. Ingersol
sandbagged”.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.642
Then let's call the judge.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.113
She made you sit down
for this deposition.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.583
She will make you
address my question.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.655
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Florrick.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.622
We're gonna have
to leave it there.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.457
No. Wha... wait a minute.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.320
INGERSOL:
I just received

06:05.360 --> 06:07.726
an emergency text
I have to address.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.591
Sir, you have barely been here
for three minutes.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.063
I have only asked you
one question.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.658
Two.
No,one.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.588
The judge was explicit
in her ruling.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.766
If we made the effort
to be near your ranch,

06:15.800 --> 06:16.937
you must sit down with us

06:16.970 --> 06:18.506
for at least
three hours.
And I will.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.679
But, again, this is
an emergency.
No, sir!

06:20.710 --> 06:22.849
I'll be back
this afternoon at 2:00.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.040
Please be patient.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.445
You will get your time.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.640
I promise you.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.786
Well, that is unfortunate.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.117
FRANK:
No, I think

06:32.150 --> 06:33.481
you're doing well.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.782
We expected a bump
in Maddie's polling.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.481
She's the fresh
new thing.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.349
Yes, we expected that, too.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.927
We're still beating her
47 to 42.5.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.154
That's _outside
the margin of error.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.168
I know.
We're not worried.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.760
And yet you're here.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.067
It's a visit.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.601
The Democratic Committee

06:49.640 --> 06:51.437
_ has a lot invested
In your boy FlorrIck.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.028
We want to _make sure
he wms.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.638
And you're worried he won't?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.671
I'm worried the sun _
won't me tomorrow, Ell.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.007
It's a visit.
That's all.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.642
Thank you.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.739
Come again sometime.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.613
I heard something.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.689
Something that
worried me.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.688
I heard your offices
were raided.

07:10.730 --> 07:11.822
It's nothing, Frank.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.849
It's not nothing.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.721
No raid is nothing.
A raid is something.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.567
It's not about the candidate.
I know it's not

07:16.600 --> 07:18.192
about the candidate.
It's about you.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.737
(closing door):
I'm not hiding anything
from you.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.204
There are forces

07:25.240 --> 07:26.207
within the Justice Department

07:26.240 --> 07:28.538
that_ do not want Peter
to wrn the governorshlp.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.639
Now, they don't have the facts
to come after him,

07:30.680 --> 07:33.069
so they're coming after me
as a steppingstone to Peter.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.611
And they have the facts
to come after you?
N-No.

07:35.650 --> 07:38.517
I'm just saying, they know

07:38.550 --> 07:40.609
that Peter without me
would be limping.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.480
So, they want this.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.522
They want you coming
to me suggesting...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.597
What are you suggesting?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.620
Not that you resign.

07:51.670 --> 07:52.694
You're not
an Issue yet.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.230
But you need
a strong second

07:54.270 --> 07:56.033
in case you do
become an issue.

07:56.070 --> 07:58.561
I know you don't like it, Eli.
(laughs quietly)

07:58.610 --> 08:00.032
But you need a second.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.139
*

08:12.920 --> 08:14.581
So, 2:00 pm, huh?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.724
Yes. I'm not sure
what happened.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.819
The judge won't be happy.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.691
Mr. Ingersol
is a very...

08:20.730 --> 08:23.699
If I hear one more time
how busy Mr. Ingersol is,

08:23.730 --> 08:24.867
I will strangle you.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.891
(phone rings)

08:27.940 --> 08:29.532
Hello?

08:29.570 --> 08:32.573
Yeah, yeah.
I understand.

08:32.610 --> 08:35.078
No, uh, she's here.
I'll tell her.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.839
Okay, thank you. Bye.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.848
Mr. Ingersol would
like to apologize...

08:38.880 --> 08:41.144
Let's get the judge on the line.
It's an emergency.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.580
He said he just has to delay
until tomorrow morning.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.814
He set aside three hours
starting at 10:00.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.681
He won't count today's
ten minutes against it.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.688
He wanted me to apologize
to you personally.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.086
He said he really enjoyed
his time with you this morning.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.552
Let the record reflect

08:52.600 --> 08:55.319
that Mr. Ingersol has refused
to attend...

08:55.360 --> 08:57.169
He didn't refuse
to attend.
...failed to appear

08:57.200 --> 09:00.692
in a court-mandated deposition,
despite promising to attend

09:00.740 --> 09:03.709
between the hours
of 2:00 and 5:00 pm. today.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.731
Alicia, you might want
to look at this tonight.

09:05.770 --> 09:06.907
The CDC has revised
their report.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.170
It seems there's another
possible cause for the outbreak

09:09.210 --> 09:11.599
of West Nile virus besides
just our SWImmIng pools.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.675
WILL:
A koi pond?!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.779
ALICIA:
Yes, from a house
that wasn't foreclosed.

09:15.820 --> 09:16.787
Damn it.

09:16.820 --> 09:18.185
The CDC report isn't saying

09:18.220 --> 09:20.688
it's definitely
from the koi pond

09:20.720 --> 09:22.051
or from the swimming pools.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.786
But the koi pond
also had stagnant water.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.956
The bank just got
its wiggle room.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.594
Yup.
Okay, Alicia,

09:27.630 --> 09:28.528
we'll handle this on our end.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.721
You just get
the bank president on record

09:30.770 --> 09:31.794
about the neighbors' letter.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.229
When is he supposed to arrive?

09:33.270 --> 09:34.794
10:00 a.m. tomorrow, but I think
I'm getting the runaround.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.967
Yeah. They'll probably wait
until you're out getting

09:37.010 --> 09:38.830
breakfast or something,
then they'll tell the judge

09:38.870 --> 09:40.599
the witness was available,
but they couldn't find you.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.200
Mm. Unfortunately,
you'll have to outwait them.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.810
Stay close to your room
so they can't say you were out.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.819
Oh. Yeah, okay. But I was only
planning to stay for one night.

09:48.850 --> 09:49.942
We'll get clothes
and incidentals

09:49.990 --> 09:51.981
out to you.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.780
Mr. Hayden.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.298
Hello. I've been trying
to get to you all day.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.866
Yes. I've been in meetings.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.128
Do you have a minute?

10:04.170 --> 10:06.195
No, actually, I don't.

10:10.840 --> 10:15.038
Have you, uh, received
a notice of mediation?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.877
No.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.741
But you...

10:18.780 --> 10:20.941
Mr. Hayden, is-is there
something I should know?

10:20.980 --> 10:21.947
(elevator bell dings)

10:21.980 --> 10:24.312
(door opens,
Clarke sighs)

10:24.350 --> 10:27.888
I requested the mediation.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.080
You?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.883
Why?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.728
You need to be removed
from your pOSItlons.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.955
The firm can't be merged
with you in control.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.820
Mr. Hayden, this is...

10:37.870 --> 10:38.928
We've been nothing but cordial.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.790
This is not
about cordial.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.660
I had a firm ready to merge,

10:42.710 --> 10:44.860
to pay off your creditors,
and you sabotaged it.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.036
It was a bad deal.
They wanted to break us up.
Yes, they did.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.276
That's exactly the point,
Ms. Lockhart.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.073
You have creditors,
you owe them money.

10:49.110 --> 10:52.147
They are not interested
in your self-fulfillment.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.841
They are interested
in their money.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.279
Then let_us make them
theIr money.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.788
Well, you'll have a chance
to argue that in mediation.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.913
(elevator bell dings, buzzing)

10:59.960 --> 11:02.087
If we merge the firm,
the creditors will receive

11:02.120 --> 11:04.850
70 cents on the dollar
right now.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.757
Or they can trust that you
will bring this firm back.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.190
Either way,
I'll see you in mediation.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.252
No, no, take it.
No, no.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.860
I'm fine. You.
I probably have
more in my room.

11:43.900 --> 11:44.924
Are you sure?
I can split it with you.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.234
No, that'd be messy.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.068
Thanks. I think the next
store is 50 miles away.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.862
Are you here
for the air show?
No.

11:51.910 --> 11:54.834
There's an air show?
Yeah, I think so.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.075
The hotel clerk kept talking
about it. It was...

11:57.110 --> 11:58.839
Oh. Excuse me.
I have to run.

12:00.450 --> 12:04.409
Mr. Canning! Hi. I'm here.
I'm here. What's up?

12:04.450 --> 12:07.510
Oh, yeah, Alicia, I was... I was
just about to leave you a note.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.926
Mr. Ingersol can come in
earlier this morning.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.757
Right now, as a matter of fact.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.189
Uh, we thought we'd missed you.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.790
I'm ready. I will meet you
at the business center.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.128
Right.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.333
(clock ticking)

12:21.370 --> 12:23.258
Must have been delayed.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.301
That seems to happen a lot.

12:28.510 --> 12:31.274
I have a friend who...
who's dying.

12:31.310 --> 12:34.473
Wants me to give the eulogy
at-at his funeral.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.943
He just e-mailed me.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.912
He's dying,
and he sent you an e-mail?

12:38.950 --> 12:40.850
His wife did.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.779
I hate that people my age
are starting to die.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.219
It's really horrible.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.898
It is.

12:47.930 --> 12:49.454
He was my roommate
in college.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.092
Ian Keyes.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.496
Smartest guy
I ever met.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.032
Ever give a eulogy?

12:58.870 --> 13:01.134
Yes.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.172
To someone close?

13:04.210 --> 13:06.917
Yes.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.474
VVho?

13:09.890 --> 13:12.381
My father.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.457
I'm sorry.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.458
How old was he when he died?

13:17.490 --> 13:19.481
60.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.191
That's young.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.198
It is.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.221
(clock ticking)

13:25.270 --> 13:26.862
Am I upsetting you?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.903
No. Um, why don't you call
Mr. Ingersol,

13:29.940 --> 13:31.999
and see what time
he's gonna be here?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.405
I'm not playing you, Alicia.
He's coming.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.271
I know.

13:35.310 --> 13:38.143
Yeah. We're here.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.977
No?

13:41.020 --> 13:42.271
Okay, wh-when?

13:42.320 --> 13:44.288
All right, well,
just keep me in touch.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.880
2:00 this afternoon.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.888
Let the record reflect

13:48.920 --> 13:53.357
that Mr. Ingersol has refused
to appear

13:53.400 --> 13:56.551
at a court-mandated
depOSItlon...

13:56.600 --> 13:58.864
again.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.959
DIANE:
You sure you want
to do this?

14:01.000 --> 14:01.967
What's the downside?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.262
You're a low
priority.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.938
Provoking them with
a harassment suit

14:05.970 --> 14:08.131
could make you
a high priority.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.047
I don't think
I have any option.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.173
WENDY:
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.313
I'm brand-new on this case,
and there was a disagreement

14:15.350 --> 14:18.513
about who should
take this meeting.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.017
Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Gold,
good to see you again.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.186
Oh, come on!

14:21.220 --> 14:22.653
This is a conflict of interest.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.021
What's that, Mr. Gold?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.379
You ran against
my boss. You lost.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.352
I beat you.
Yes, that's true.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.129
Two years ago.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.991
You asked for a proffer

14:31.030 --> 14:33.134
against Mr. Florrick.
That is a conflict of interest.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.239
No, that was
my investigator,

14:34.270 --> 14:36.591
Mr. LaGuardia. I have since
rescinded that offer.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.973
Discounts for donations is
a serious busmess, Mr. Gold.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.978
The Do] takes it
very seriously.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.069
God. No one disappears.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.044
They all come back,
like zombies.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.275
Eli. This is a complaint,
Ms. Scott-Carr,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.345
against the Do]
and your department.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.449
We are charging you
with harassment.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.412
Please read it.
I will.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.189
And I'll have my secretary
contact you

14:56.220 --> 14:57.448
about a time to interview.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.627
ELI:
You want

14:58.660 --> 15:00.525
to beat Peter,
do it at the ballot box.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.448
Don't use this petty ploy.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.127
This is not
about beating Peter.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.364
So you're angry at me now?

15:05.400 --> 15:06.560
(laughs)

15:06.600 --> 15:07.999
Do I look angry?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.291
My directive here
is simple:

15:09.340 --> 15:11.308
Clean up
political corruption.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.706
That's all.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.708
You underestimate me

15:15.740 --> 15:17.970
if you think
I'm working from bias.

15:18.010 --> 15:18.999
I'll be in touch.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.017
And you'll read our complaint?

15:20.050 --> 15:22.075
Oh, yes. I have it right here.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.509
Sorry, I have to get
to my next meeting.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.381
ALICIA:
Hello?

15:26.420 --> 15:27.956
Oh, hi.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.322
I just saw
you had to run off, so, I...

15:30.360 --> 15:31.987
Oh, my gosh.

15:32.030 --> 15:33.349
You didn't have
to do that.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.027
I know. It
was nothing.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.698
Well, thank you.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.425
Uh... what do I owe you?

15:38.470 --> 15:40.529
No, no, no, nothing.
Well, I have
to pay you something.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.130
No, you don't. No.
Next time. I'm Simone.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.262
Oh, um, Alicia.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.006
There aren't many
people around here.
Yes, I know.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.679
It's so strange that they built
this big hotel up here.

15:49.710 --> 15:52.008
So, are you here
for vacation or something?

15:52.050 --> 15:54.018
Oh, no. Work. You?
Uh.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.415
Oh, my husband's here for work.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.281
You are probably the lavwer
that he's here to meet.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.981
Are you Mrs. Canning?

16:02.020 --> 16:03.021
Yes. Are you
Mrs. Florrick?

16:03.060 --> 16:04.584
Yes.
My husband

16:04.630 --> 16:06.154
speaks so highly of you.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.124
He does?
Yes.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.650
He does.
He thinks you're fantastic.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.997
(laughs)
I'm joking.

16:15.040 --> 16:15.995
But we should have breakfast
sometime.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.032
You know, if we're going
to be here for a while.

16:19.070 --> 16:21.630
Are we going to be here
for a while?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.773
I don't know.
You tell me.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.199
(laughs)
(laughs)

16:26.250 --> 16:27.774
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.378
So, I'll call you for breakfast?

16:29.420 --> 16:31.240
Good. Yeah.
Okay.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.216
Simone?

16:35.260 --> 16:36.318
Yes?

16:36.360 --> 16:40.592
I was so sorry to hear
about your husband's friend.

16:40.630 --> 16:43.064
The one who's dying?

16:43.100 --> 16:44.362
Who's that?

16:46.430 --> 16:48.694
Oh, never mind.
It was my mistake.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.061
It was lovely
to meet you, Simone.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.271
You, as well, Alicia.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.375
Good job, Kalinda.
He's sure?

16:58.410 --> 17:01.140
Yeah. Look,
as far as I can tell,

17:01.180 --> 17:03.819
the Aedus...
Eedus...? Aed...?

17:03.850 --> 17:06.080
Aedes albopictus.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.678
The...

17:07.720 --> 17:10.655
This kind of mosquito breed
doesn't transmit West Nile,

17:10.690 --> 17:13.090
so it couldn't have come
from the koi pond.

17:13.130 --> 17:16.827
That virus is transmitted
by the ae-aed...

17:16.860 --> 17:19.567
The other one?
Aedes aegypti.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.795
Aedes aegypti.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.229
By a different
type of mosquito.

17:24.270 --> 17:25.407
Excellent. Very good.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.203
Just get him on the record.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.798
Ah, that'll be fun.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.799
We'll call you
back, Kalinda.

17:33.850 --> 17:36.148
What's going on
out there?

17:37.450 --> 17:39.816
He's getting Cary in line
to testify against us.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.455
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.551
Good. Thank you, Cary.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.623
Cary?

17:52.670 --> 17:54.467
Yes?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.263
What was Clarke discussing
with you?

17:56.300 --> 17:57.608
Uh, nothing.
He just wanted to know

17:57.640 --> 17:59.164
about the clients
who left last week.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.234
And what did you say?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.508
I said nothing.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.405
I just listened.
We're just a little

18:03.450 --> 18:06.374
worried he's trying to line
up a case against us, Cary.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.742
And that he
might use you.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.213
Do you think
that's a possibility?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.389
He didn't say anything
about that.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.181
Can we, um, talk to you, Cary,

18:17.230 --> 18:20.119
about possibly
testifying for us?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.297
(crows cawing)

18:21.330 --> 18:24.766
2:30. And here we are again.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.394
Why don't you go for a walk?
I'll get you when he comes.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.431
(laughs)

18:31.440 --> 18:33.579
How's your friend who's dying?

18:33.610 --> 18:35.407
Have you heard any more
from him?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.647
No. Why?

18:37.680 --> 18:40.877
Maybe you should call him.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.718
Maybe he's dead.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.638
Excuse me?

18:46.690 --> 18:48.658
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.385
Am I being insensitive?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.489
How's the eulogy coming? I mean,

18:52.530 --> 18:54.589
maybe you could ask Simone
to help you on that.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.848
You met my wife.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.424
Yes, I did.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.335
She's wonderful.

19:00.370 --> 19:03.407
Yes, she's...
my better half.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.668
She's your only half.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.302
Funny, she'd never

19:06.340 --> 19:08.535
heard of Ian Keyes,
your roommate.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.741
Yeah, well...

19:10.780 --> 19:12.748
I don't share everything
with her.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.372
Your lies, for example.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.478
You don't share your lies?

19:15.520 --> 19:17.340
No.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.187
Those I save for you.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.357
(laughs)

19:20.390 --> 19:22.210
What was even the point

19:22.260 --> 19:24.751
of lying
about a dying friend?

19:24.790 --> 19:26.621
I don't know. _
It was a way of connecting.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.355
Didn't you feel
we were connected?

19:28.400 --> 19:32.291
How does a bastard like you end
up with such a wonderful wife?

19:32.330 --> 19:33.763
Women like bastards.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.438
Didn't you notice that?
It's like a challenge.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.630
Beauty and the Beast.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.707
It fits in with all the fairy
tales you grew up consuming.

19:39.740 --> 19:40.877
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.275
(phone ringing)
Oh, there's Godot.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.301
Hello.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.847
All right. Really?

19:48.880 --> 19:52.316
Let the record show
that Mr. Ingersol has refused

19:52.350 --> 19:55.808
to attend a court-mandated
deposition for the fourth time.

19:55.860 --> 19:56.986
He was literally

19:57.020 --> 19:59.329
a minute away
when he had another call.
Oh, really?

19:59.360 --> 20:00.395
Just a minute away? Wow.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.898
He says he can reschedule
for tomorrow at 10:00.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.694
Okay, sure.
Um, it'll just...

20:05.730 --> 20:08.858
It'll give you some time
to read this.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.802
It's saying that the CDC
is updating their report again.

20:12.840 --> 20:13.977
The mosquito carrying

20:14.010 --> 20:17.002
the West Nile virus could not
have come from the koi pond.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.302
That's the wrong kind
of mosquito.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.444
The right kind of mosquito
could only

20:21.480 --> 20:23.243
have_ come
from the swnmmlng pools.

20:23.290 --> 20:27.317
So, nice try, Mr. Canning,
but you lost.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.487
And every day
that this deposition is delayed,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.579
the judge is getting angrier,
so...

20:31.630 --> 20:32.927
(clicks tongue)

20:32.960 --> 20:34.393
...might want
to rethink your strategy.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.428
(dialing touch tones)

20:39.470 --> 20:42.030
Yeah, it's me.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.436
Yeah, I need you
to look into something.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.837
So, Kaley, hi.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.699
Hi.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.775
I just want to ask you
a few questions,

20:49.810 --> 20:52.677
and I know they might seem odd
to you, but please

20:52.710 --> 20:54.519
bear with me.
Have you ever

20:54.550 --> 20:56.745
heard of Aedes aegypti?

20:56.780 --> 20:58.589
No.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.554
Well, I can understand why.

21:00.590 --> 21:04.026
That's a very long word
for a very small mosquito.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.654
You don't have to patronize her.
She's not eight years old.

21:06.690 --> 21:08.920
Thank you, Mr. Agos.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.892
This is

21:09.930 --> 21:11.921
an Aedes aegypti, Kaley.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.028
This is the breed of mosquito

21:13.070 --> 21:15.061
that carries the
West Nile virus.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.068
We didn't know_that until
your attorneys pomted It out,

21:17.100 --> 21:18.431
so thank you, Mr. Gardner,

21:18.470 --> 21:19.903
Mr. Agos.
What do you have?

21:19.940 --> 21:21.578
Now here are

21:21.610 --> 21:24.670
diagrams of the five
abandoned swimming pools

21:24.710 --> 21:26.041
that bred
the moquItoes.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.014
WILL:
Seems you've dropped
the "supposedly."

21:28.050 --> 21:29.813
Are we in agreement, the
pools bred these mosquitoes?

21:29.850 --> 21:31.681
Yes, we are.
Hallelujah.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.450
Now, here are five diagrams
of the five

21:34.490 --> 21:37.482
backyards, and
do you see here?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.919
Here are the distances
between the pools

21:39.960 --> 21:40.995
and the perimeter fences.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.827
30 yards, 40 yards.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.690
And so on.
Do you see?

21:43.730 --> 21:44.822
Yes.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.360
The thing about Aedes aegypti:

21:46.400 --> 21:47.537
they are peridomestic

21:47.570 --> 21:49.367
mosquitoes.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.958
That means they exhibit
short flight ranges

21:51.010 --> 21:52.830
of less than 50 feet.

21:52.870 --> 21:55.009
That means there is no way
they could have flown beyond

21:55.040 --> 21:56.439
their respective yards.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.071
Are you testifying here, Martha?

21:57.110 --> 21:58.771
All preamble.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.072
Here's my question.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.670
Kaley, did you climb the fence

22:02.720 --> 22:04.517
into one of these
abandoned yards?

22:08.590 --> 22:09.989
Sorry to ask you
again, Kaley,

22:10.020 --> 22:11.783
but you must
tell the truth here.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.889
Did you climb the fence
into one or more

22:13.930 --> 22:16.091
of the yards of these
abandoned houses?

22:16.130 --> 22:17.563
(sniffles)

22:17.600 --> 22:19.522
One.

22:19.570 --> 22:20.992
With my friends.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.702
Then, I'm sorry,
but the plaintiff

22:23.740 --> 22:25.105
trespassed onto
our property,

22:25.140 --> 22:28.769
and we cannot be held liable
for that trespass.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.471
This suit is over.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.420
My name is Serafina Norvey,
and before we get started,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.553
I'd like to set the ground rules
for this mediation.

22:45.590 --> 22:49.094
Granted, we're in your offices,
and outside those doors,

22:49.130 --> 22:52.520
you may all be bosses,
but in here, I am the empress.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.936
Now, I understand,

22:54.970 --> 22:55.994
as the court-appointed trustee,

22:56.040 --> 22:56.995
you'd like to have

22:57.040 --> 22:59.099
the two principals removed
as managing partners?

22:59.140 --> 22:59.936
CLARKE:
Yes.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.835
They blocked a merger
of the firm

23:01.880 --> 23:03.029
that I'd arranged
with Burl Preston.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.004
That merger would have met
all the financial obligations

23:08.020 --> 23:12.138
A merger was never part
of the original arrangement.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.987
Mr. Hayden overstepped
his authority

23:14.020 --> 23:15.885
when he tried
to arrange that deal

23:15.920 --> 23:18.150
before the full term
of the five-month deadline.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.122
My job was

23:19.160 --> 23:21.025
to satisfy the terms
set down by the court.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.698
Actually, it was against
the terms of the court,

23:22.730 --> 23:26.029
in that it did not honor
the original timeframe.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.890
Also, it worked
to undermine our progress.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.895
What progress?

23:28.940 --> 23:32.103
We've managed to raise
a great deal of money

23:32.140 --> 23:33.437
in a short amount of time.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.629
How much?

23:34.680 --> 23:35.635
Excuse me?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.669
How much money?

23:36.710 --> 23:37.677
$20 million.

23:37.710 --> 23:38.972
Which is 40
million short

23:39.010 --> 23:39.977
of what they need.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.170
WILL:
And we are very close

23:41.220 --> 23:42.517
to finalizing
a $13 million settlement

23:42.550 --> 23:44.188
with Atlantic
Commerce Bank.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.118
They are not "very close."

23:45.150 --> 23:46.185
They are in deposition.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.085
Which is how it works,
Mr. Hayden.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.109
You negotiate
in depositions.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.025
You try to stay out of court.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.028
Ma'am, if we had a trustee
who understood the law...

23:53.060 --> 23:55.551
Excuse me.
I know as much as anyone...!

23:55.600 --> 23:57.192
All right,
all right.

23:57.230 --> 23:58.697
This is not marriage court.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.062
I'm not here to make you
like each other.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.795
But, Ms. Lockhart,

24:02.840 --> 24:04.068
Mr. Gardner,
I think you're losing sight

24:04.110 --> 24:05.463
of the big picture here.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.728
This isn't about you.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.906
This is about
your creditors.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.601
Yes, Your Honor.
"Ma'am."

24:10.650 --> 24:12.003
I'm not a judge.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.974
Excuse me, ma'am.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.944
Our creditors are voting
with their pocketbook

24:17.990 --> 24:19.218
by buying up our debt.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.081
They are?
WILL:
Yes.

24:21.120 --> 24:21.950
We recently got in touch

24:21.990 --> 24:23.958
with our creditors
about this mediation,

24:23.990 --> 24:26.857
and they informed us that they
no longer are our creditors.

24:26.890 --> 24:29.723
A consortium of financiers
called Encinal Equity

24:29.760 --> 24:31.068
has purchased their debt.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.091
And people don't buy bad debt.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.597
Yes, but by
that logic,

24:34.640 --> 24:37.666
your creditors are fleeing
your debt by selling it.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.200
People don't sell good debt.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.003
DIANE:
Ma'am, all we ask is

24:41.040 --> 24:43.508
for enough time
to present our arguments.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.847
This mediation has come

24:44.880 --> 24:45.949
as quite a surprise to us.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.516
How long will you need?

24:47.550 --> 24:48.676
We should be prepared
to present

24:48.720 --> 24:49.846
witnesses and evidence
by next week.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.041
Tomorrow.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.910
CARY: Let's talk about
the swimming pool

24:53.960 --> 24:55.780
at 233 Graham Court.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.117
This one here.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.025
This pool had several
water features, correct?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.186
I'm not sure
what you mean.

25:00.230 --> 25:01.254
In addition to having

25:01.300 --> 25:02.449
a deep end and a shallow end,

25:02.500 --> 25:05.219
there was also a diving board,
a waterfall, and a grotto?

25:05.270 --> 25:06.567
Okay.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.794
I agree.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.229
Was the grotto boarded up
after the bank took possession?

25:10.270 --> 25:12.033
No.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.974
Did you receive reports
from neighbors

25:16.010 --> 25:18.899
that the waterfall feature
was being used by skateboarders?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.178
Where's this going,
gentlemen?

25:20.210 --> 25:22.019
Mr. Millam, would you admit

25:22.050 --> 25:23.688
the pool was
an attractive nuisance?

25:23.720 --> 25:24.789
Objection.

25:24.820 --> 25:25.980
That does not apply here.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.159
Kaley climbed a fence
to reach the pool.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.988
Which makes it a textbook case
of attractive nuisance.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.021
It's the responsibility
of the homeowner--

25:33.060 --> 25:34.857
mmswm,
Atlantic Commerce Bank--

25:34.900 --> 25:35.958
to secure the swimming pool

25:36.000 --> 25:38.025
and make sure it did not
become a danger to children.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.129
Once again, there was a fence,
and your client is not a child.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.229
WILL: Kaley Spence was
12 years old at the time.

25:42.270 --> 25:44.329
A very young, sheltered 12.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.304
So you were sheltered?
Is that it, Kaley?

25:46.340 --> 25:49.571
You want to question
our client, depose her.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.148
Oh, you sure are well-dressed.

25:55.180 --> 25:58.149
Thanks.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.658
And you are in my office.

26:00.690 --> 26:01.315
FRANK: Oh, I see
you two have met.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.683
Eli Gold, Jordan Karahalios.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.595
Oh!

26:07.630 --> 26:08.426
The boy wonder.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.621
(chuckles):
God, I hate that name.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.626
The ever-quotable Rahm Emanuel.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.069
Never gonna
live that down.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.692
We were headed out to see Peter.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.264
I figured you two
should meet first.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.201
Because...?

26:20.240 --> 26:22.208
FRANK: That thing
we discussed before,

26:22.240 --> 26:24.208
about how you
needed a second.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.603
I like Peter.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.118
He's not one of those
processed sales jobs.

26:28.150 --> 26:29.071
He's got grit.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.145
Jordan wants to offer
you guys some time.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.009
He's had lots
of offers.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.756
Even Maddie Hayward,
isn't that right?

26:33.790 --> 26:34.950
Yeah, she's great.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.116
A little green, maybe.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.718
So, you think you two
can work together?

26:37.760 --> 26:41.252
I heard you like
to work alone, Jordan.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.892
I do.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.364
But I also like to learn
from my elders.

26:47.370 --> 26:48.769
I just want
to get an idea

26:48.800 --> 26:50.028
how you might handle
certain situations, okay?

26:50.070 --> 26:51.105
Okay.

26:51.140 --> 26:54.303
Would you ever go into a store
and take something

26:54.340 --> 26:55.375
without paying
for it?

26:55.410 --> 26:56.570
KALEY:
No.

26:56.610 --> 26:59.408
MARTHA: If you got lost in
an airport, what would you do?

26:59.450 --> 27:01.918
Find a policeman
and ask him to help.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.987
Were you ever allowed to stay
home alone without a babysitter?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.942
Sometimes.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.309
Well, I used to.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.726
Not now,
because of what happened to me.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.022
Thank you, Kaley.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.254
That's all.

27:13.290 --> 27:15.758
Your client is mature enough
to understand right and wrong.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.290
Attractive nuisance
does not apply here.

27:17.330 --> 27:18.763
That's not for you
to decide.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.324
That's right.
It's for a jury.

27:20.370 --> 27:21.860
Which means court.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.390
Which means we're not
negotiating a settlement.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.907
Damn it.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.237
Still in a holding pattern.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.009
He's supposed to be here
in an hour,

27:31.050 --> 27:32.369
but I'm not holding my breath.

27:32.410 --> 27:34.014
We really need Ingersol.

27:34.050 --> 27:35.415
The case is
going down the drain.

27:35.450 --> 27:37.008
I think it's about this merger

27:37.050 --> 27:38.312
with Corsica Pacific.
What do you mean?

27:38.350 --> 27:41.251
Alicia, they're stalling

27:41.290 --> 27:43.679
because they don't want
a $13 million settlement

27:43.730 --> 27:45.379
to mess up
this merger.
Well, we can't wait.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.853
Alicia, is there any way you can
get proof they're stalling?

27:53.330 --> 27:55.036
Bad news, unfortunately.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.389
Really? What a surprise.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.237
Yeah, it'll have to be pushed
till this afternoon.

27:58.270 --> 27:59.362
Something came up
at the last minute.

27:59.410 --> 28:04.746
I say, it's pushed
till this afternoon.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.944
I thought we would use this time
to depose someone else.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.379
What, for practice?
Rita!

28:10.420 --> 28:12.183
What's going on here, Alicia?

28:12.220 --> 28:14.780
Please have a seat,
Ms. Neves.

28:14.820 --> 28:18.449
Would you state your name and
your occupation for the record?

28:18.490 --> 28:19.650
Rita Neves.

28:19.690 --> 28:23.251
I am a housekeeper here at
the Janesville Mountain Retreat.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.426
What, are we playing games here?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.290
And this morning,
were you near enough

28:26.330 --> 28:28.867
to Mr. Canning to overhear
his telephone conversation?

28:28.900 --> 28:30.333
_ RITA: Yes. I was
in his room cleaning

28:30.370 --> 28:32.930
while he was talking
on the phone.

28:32.970 --> 28:34.176
Objection. That's hearsay.

28:34.210 --> 28:35.279
Can you describe what you heard?

28:35.310 --> 28:37.778
He say, "No, don't come now.

28:37.810 --> 28:39.346
I call when Florrick steps out."

28:39.380 --> 28:40.347
Objection.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.439
That had nothing to do
with Wilkes Ingersol.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.448
Is that statement
for the record?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.310
This conversation is
totally taken out of context.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.386
It had nothing to do
with Wilkes Ingersol.

28:48.420 --> 28:52.823
It was to my...
partners in Chicago.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.327
Ed, you can come in now!

28:54.360 --> 28:55.258
What now, Mrs. Florrick?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.029
You got some farmers
you want to depose?

28:57.060 --> 28:59.062
Can you state your name
and occupation?

28:59.100 --> 29:01.239
Ed Jeffries.
I work at the front desk.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.761
And, um, can you tell me
how many calls were made

29:03.810 --> 29:05.038
from Mr. Canning's hotel room?

29:05.070 --> 29:06.059
Objection.

29:06.110 --> 29:07.065
Your objection has been

29:07.110 --> 29:08.179
preserved for the record.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.404
Please tell me
how many calls

29:09.440 --> 29:12.409
were placed from
Mr. Canning's room?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.270
Four.
That is private information.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.311
And were all those calls
placed to the same number?

29:16.350 --> 29:18.386
Three to the Ingersol Ranch,
one to another local number.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.308
So no calls were placed

29:20.350 --> 29:22.113
to Mr. Canning's partners
in Chicago?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.355
Well, there were no calls
to Chicago.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.221
Thank you, Ed.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.829
Oh.

29:37.870 --> 29:41.237
Don't you want to stay
for my call to the judge?

29:41.280 --> 29:44.272
Or do you want to be held
in contempt in absentia?

29:45.580 --> 29:47.775
(dialing)

29:50.150 --> 29:52.311
JUDGE:
Given this evidence,
Mr. Canning,

29:52.350 --> 29:53.886
I rule for the plaintiff.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.081
Present the witness
or be held in contempt.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.929
When is the earliest
he can be deposed?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.154
Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.420
Your Honor, Mr. Canning has been
saying that for two days now.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.599
Mr. Ingersol is dealing
with an ongoing emergency.

30:03.630 --> 30:05.495
Mr. Canning,
have your client there

30:05.530 --> 30:07.521
at 10:00 a.m.
or be held in contempt.

30:07.570 --> 30:08.969
Do you understand?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.137
I do.

30:10.170 --> 30:12.434
(line clicks)

30:12.470 --> 30:14.472
I'll see you
at 10:00.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.578
I don't need a lawyer.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.942
Yes, but you never know
about the future, Mr. Ellstrom.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.218
Tobin.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.252
I'm not in politics
anymore, Ms. Lockhart.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.451
The Department of Justice
is making moves

30:30.490 --> 30:33.027
against past and current
campaign managers,

30:33.060 --> 30:36.120
so I think that you should
review your past campaigns.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.457
"Making moves"?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.024
On what issue?

30:39.070 --> 30:40.389
Discounts for donations.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.297
Campaign managers offering
discounted legal services

30:43.340 --> 30:45.535
in exchange
for campaign contributions.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.936
That's just Chicago politics.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.369
And since you were a lawyer
prior to your work

30:50.410 --> 30:53.277
as Wendy Scott-Carr's
campaign strategist,

30:53.310 --> 30:55.073
I thought there might be
some issue there.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.348
This is about
Wendy Scott-Carr?

30:56.380 --> 30:58.439
No.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.344
It's about
all your campaign work.

31:00.390 --> 31:02.654
But Wendy Scott-Carr
especially?

31:02.690 --> 31:04.351
Okay.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.051
I'll think about it.

31:06.090 --> 31:07.899
Certainly. Here's my card.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.921
Don't forget.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.367
(cell phone ringtone playing)

31:16.400 --> 31:18.038
Hello, Tobin.

31:18.070 --> 31:19.367
How nice to hear from you.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.004
TOBIN: Do you know a lavwer
named Diane Lockhart?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.439
Yes, I do. Why?

31:23.480 --> 31:26.301
She just approached me
about my past work with you.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.375
She did?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.172
Yeah, she said the Department
of Justice is investigating

31:30.220 --> 31:31.983
discounts for donations,
and that I might be implicated.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.988
(sighs)

31:34.020 --> 31:35.988
She wanted you to call me.

31:36.020 --> 31:36.987
What?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.521
She wanted you to call me

31:38.560 --> 31:40.528
so I would know
that if I pursue them

31:40.560 --> 31:43.552
on discounts for donations,
they'll pull you in.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.067
No, she just wanted me
to hire her.

31:45.100 --> 31:45.919
No, Tobin, she didn't.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.530
This was a warning shot
across my bow.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.595
So what are you gonna do?

31:50.640 --> 31:52.562
We ran a clean campaign, Tobin,
didn't we?

31:52.610 --> 31:55.670
Well, yes, but nothing's 100%.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.029
No, we ran

31:57.080 --> 31:59.640
a clean campaign.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.978
Just don't talk to her again.

32:04.650 --> 32:06.641
(knocking)

32:21.740 --> 32:24.163
Kalinda.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.507
And clothes.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.303
And incidentals.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.376
Ah.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.975
(sighs):
God, it's quiet.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.678
Yeah.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.415
You've had two days of this?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.428
And two nights.

32:44.460 --> 32:45.722
It's not that bad, actually.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.387
(sighs)

32:47.430 --> 32:48.454
Really?

32:48.500 --> 32:49.728
I'd kill someone.

32:52.730 --> 32:55.267
You know what I miss
about my old life?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.768
Before the glamour of the law?

32:57.800 --> 32:59.734
What?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.977
The quiet.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.144
At home, in the afternoons,

33:05.180 --> 33:08.274
I would drink every day at 3:00.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.289
A glass of red wine.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.016
Waiting for the kids
to come home.

33:16.220 --> 33:20.179
I miss the silence
in the house at 3:00.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.221
Just...

33:23.730 --> 33:25.721
...nothing going on.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.431
I miss this.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.436
Yeah.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.744
(chuckles softly)

33:39.780 --> 33:41.645
I'm sorry.

33:45.850 --> 33:48.114
I know.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.722
(chuckles softly)

33:54.800 --> 33:56.620
You know, I don't think

33:56.660 --> 33:59.060
Ingersol's gonna show up
tomorrow at 10:00.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.624
I know.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.638
Cary thinks that
they're trying to avoid

34:02.670 --> 34:04.661
a road bump
in their merger.

34:05.770 --> 34:09.069
Do you have that other number
Canning was calling?

34:09.110 --> 34:13.069
There were three to the ranch
and one to a local number.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.418
Yeah.

34:14.450 --> 34:15.610
What's your thinking?

34:16.650 --> 34:18.345
(sighs):
I don't know.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.381
Maybe there's a real emergency.

34:22.860 --> 34:26.421
Cary Agos. A fourth-year
associate at Lockhart/Gardner.

34:26.460 --> 34:30.499
DIANE:
And were you asked by Mr. Hayden
for your assistance

34:30.530 --> 34:32.691
over the last three months?
Yes.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.563
And for how many hours a week
were you asked to help him?

34:35.600 --> 34:36.737
Roughly...

34:36.770 --> 34:37.839
ten hours a week.

34:37.870 --> 34:39.735
And this was done
on your time?

34:39.770 --> 34:41.533
CARY:
As a fourth-year
associate,

34:41.580 --> 34:43.832
very few hours in a day
actually constitute my time.

34:43.880 --> 34:44.869
But you managed?

34:44.910 --> 34:47.105
Yes. Yes, I did manage.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.778
DIANE:
And what did Mr. Hayden
ask of you?

34:50.820 --> 34:53.448
He asked me
to be his tutor.

34:53.490 --> 34:54.787
DIANE:
His tutor?

34:54.820 --> 34:56.458
Yes.

34:56.490 --> 34:59.527
He asked me to help him study
for the upcoming bar exam.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.755
DIANE:
And what prompted
that arrangement?

35:01.800 --> 35:04.769
Mr. Hayden had attended
law school years earlier,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.462
but never attempted
to pass the bar.

35:07.500 --> 35:11.209
Now working at Lockhart/Gardner
had reinvigorated him.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.209
DIANE:
And did you feel you had
any choice in the matter

35:14.240 --> 35:15.468
but to help him?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.878
No.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.219
Thank you, Mr. Agos.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.480
Anything, Mr. Hayden?

35:28.490 --> 35:30.754
Uh, yes.

35:30.790 --> 35:34.419
Uh, you stated
that fourth-year associates

35:34.460 --> 35:36.758
rarely have time of their own.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.824
Yes.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.590
But you found the time
to help me?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.603
I didn't feel
as if I had a choice.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.438
You held sway
over the entire firm.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.846
Isn't it true that I offered
to pay you for your a55istance?

35:53.880 --> 35:55.518
Yes, you did.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.848
And did you
refuse my offer?
Yes.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.314
Did I ever state or imply
that you would be afforded

36:00.350 --> 36:01.817
preferential treatment
for your help?

36:01.860 --> 36:04.658
No, you did not.
Did I ever state or imply

36:04.690 --> 36:08.194
that you would be penalized
if you refused to help me?

36:09.230 --> 36:12.199
No, you did not.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.892
Your Honor...
"Ma'am."

36:14.940 --> 36:17.534
Ma'am.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.834
Lockhart/Gardner...

36:19.870 --> 36:21.838
has no shame

36:21.880 --> 36:25.304
in trying to besmirch my name
for their own personal gain.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.647
It goes to their...

36:26.680 --> 36:30.673
illogical passion for
winning at all costs.

36:32.950 --> 36:36.556
Once again, I ask that
Diane Lockhart and Will Gardner

36:36.590 --> 36:39.582
be removed from their managerial
positions at the firm.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.929
I'll take your words
under advisement, Mr. Hayden.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.468
Ingersol's not dodging
the depositions

37:02.520 --> 37:03.646
because of the merger.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.908
WILL:
Why then?

37:04.950 --> 37:08.613
He's been seeking treatment at
an experimental cancer center.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.525
He's... Since when?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.528
A few months ago.
The number Canning

37:13.560 --> 37:16.654
dialed from here was a center
run by Vivek Assadullah,

37:16.700 --> 37:18.520
a cancer specialist.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.959
Ingersol's battling
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.763
That's not public knowledge.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.892
No, it's not.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.464
Thanks, Kalinda.
Is Alicia there?

37:25.510 --> 37:27.501
Sure. Alicia.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.007
Yeah?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.974
Use it. They don't want it
to come out before the merger.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.671
I know. I'm on it.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.312
(indistinct chattering)

37:36.350 --> 37:38.989
What the hell?

37:39.020 --> 37:41.853
Oh, no. Ms. Scott-Carr,
do you have an appointment?

37:41.890 --> 37:44.654
No. We're here to confiscate
Eli Gold's files.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.749
He operated
his crisis management ﬁrm

37:46.790 --> 37:49.054
out of these offices,
which makes Lockhart/Gardner

37:49.100 --> 37:50.727
open to investigation as well.

37:50.760 --> 37:51.988
That is bizarrely tenuous.

37:52.030 --> 37:55.329
And yet, supported by the judge.

37:55.970 --> 37:57.369
Thank you...

37:57.400 --> 37:59.561
for the warning shot.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.578
It gave me time
to acquire the warrant.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.908
This investigation
is so hypocritical.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.647
Okay, the files in here first.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.451
(clock ticking)

38:19.090 --> 38:20.626
Don't worry.
He's coming.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.457
He's just... a
few minutes late.

38:26.630 --> 38:28.632
(car approaching)

38:31.440 --> 38:33.431
O ye of little faith.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.573
(car doors shut)

38:36.610 --> 38:37.702
ALICIA:
Good afternoon,
Mr. Ingersol,

38:37.740 --> 38:39.002
and welcome back.
Thank you.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.302
How are you feeling today?

38:42.150 --> 38:43.777
Good. Why?

38:43.820 --> 38:45.742
Just a pleasantry.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.781
Well... thank you.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.788
I'm good.
(chuckles)

38:50.820 --> 38:53.687
Good. Why don't we pick up
where we left off.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.425
Did you see this letter

38:55.460 --> 38:57.655
that was written by the
residents of the community,

38:57.700 --> 38:59.964
complaining about the state
of the five foreclosed homes

39:00.000 --> 39:01.126
and their swimming pools?

39:01.170 --> 39:02.694
I, uh, did not.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.934
You see it's addressed to you?

39:03.970 --> 39:05.107
I do.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.062
IfI read every letter
addressed to me,

39:07.110 --> 39:09.578
I wouldn't have time
to... shave or sleep.

39:09.610 --> 39:11.840
(chuckling)

39:13.080 --> 39:14.718
So that answers that, Alicia.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.638
Any other questions?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.648
Mr. Ingersol, are you aware

39:18.690 --> 39:21.113
that it is an SEC violation
to withhold an illness

39:21.150 --> 39:22.811
from shareholders?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.725
Objection. Relevance.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.022
Your objection
has been noted.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.722
Are you aware
that it is an SEC violation?

39:30.630 --> 39:33.827
Yes, but I'm not sure what this
has to do with your lawsuit.

39:33.870 --> 39:34.768
It has to do

39:34.800 --> 39:37.769
with your intent to delay,
Mr. Ingersol.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.007
Atlantic Commerce is
a publicly held company.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.873
The shareholders have a right
to know if the leader

39:42.910 --> 39:45.970
is facing
a critical illness.

39:46.010 --> 39:48.444
And according to his profile,

39:48.480 --> 39:50.778
Dr. Vivek Assadullah
is a specialist

39:50.820 --> 39:52.617
who conducts
experimental treatments

39:52.650 --> 39:54.379
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
CANNING:
Objection.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.188
This is beneath you, Alicia.
No,

39:57.220 --> 39:58.824
unfortunately, it's not.

40:03.830 --> 40:07.823
The emergency you were dealing
with, Mr. Ingersol, was...

40:09.100 --> 40:10.761
Uh, Ms. Court Reporter,

40:10.800 --> 40:12.802
do you mind stepping out
for a moment, please?

40:12.840 --> 40:14.728
My name is Mika.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.078
So sorry. Mika. Of course.

40:20.780 --> 40:23.544
(door opens)
You were being treated
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma,

40:23.580 --> 40:25.548
and you didn't want
this knowledge made public

40:25.590 --> 40:27.615
before your merger
with Corsica Pacific.

40:29.890 --> 40:33.781
This does not have to go
on the record, Mr. Ingersol.

40:33.830 --> 40:35.889
We have been trying
for weeks now

40:35.930 --> 40:37.727
to negotiate with Mr. Canning.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.491
And if you approve
this settlement of $15 million,

40:41.540 --> 40:43.929
the questioning
can end right here.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.042
(door opens)

40:52.080 --> 40:53.775
DIANE:
Uh,

40:53.810 --> 40:54.913
one second, Eli.

40:54.950 --> 40:55.939
(quietly):
Alicia?

40:55.980 --> 40:57.675
Yes. $12 million.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.846
$3 million to us.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.517
Uh, good.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.017
I'll be right
there. Yeah.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.824
As I was saying, Eli,
unfortunately,

41:04.860 --> 41:07.829
this changes everything.
Wendy's doing this
so you can't be my lawyer.

41:07.860 --> 41:10.499
I know. But now
that we're part of this...

41:10.530 --> 41:12.088
probe into your practices,

41:12.130 --> 41:13.893
we are precluded
from representing you.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.761
We have a list
of potential attorneys.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.732
I've called the top three.

41:16.770 --> 41:19.830
All are ready for your call.
And so it goes,

41:19.870 --> 41:23.078
the endless cycle
of Chicago investigations.

41:23.110 --> 41:26.238
JORDAN:
Hey, guys. Do you know when
the old man is coming back?

41:26.280 --> 41:28.714
Eli. There you are.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.047
Let's talk
about debate prep.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.889
Let's.
Maddie Hayward is

41:31.920 --> 41:32.909
putting all her time into prep.

41:32.950 --> 41:34.611
That's when she really wants
to make her mark.

41:34.660 --> 41:35.911
And I looked at
the schedule, and you...

41:35.960 --> 41:37.916
you barely have
Peter down.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.086
WILL:
We received

41:39.130 --> 41:41.553
a settlement offer today
for $12 million.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.090
DIANE:
And just today,
Encinal Equity

41:43.130 --> 41:45.860
completed their purchase
of Lockhart/Gardner debt.

41:45.900 --> 41:48.892
They are invested
in our financial health,

41:48.940 --> 41:50.134
and we intend to honor
that commitment.

41:50.170 --> 41:51.432
Mr. Hayden,

41:51.470 --> 41:56.078
I understand your disappointment
in losing a merger opportunity,

41:56.110 --> 41:59.841
but I do believe
this purchase of debt suggests

41:59.880 --> 42:02.815
the financial community
has faith in management.

42:02.850 --> 42:04.886
Therefore, I
have determined

42:04.920 --> 42:07.309
Ms. Lockhart and Mr. Gardner not

42:07.350 --> 42:08.954
be removed
as managing partners

42:08.990 --> 42:11.652
and that they continue

42:11.690 --> 42:12.987
to work, with
your guidance,

42:13.030 --> 42:15.828
toward financial health.
After the deadline,

42:15.860 --> 42:17.555
five weeks from now,

42:17.600 --> 42:20.319
Mr. Hayden, then you might find
a merger partner.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.998
That's my ruling.

42:25.870 --> 42:28.304
(door shuts)
Escaped the executioner.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.898
WILL:
For now.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.942
We can never meet
a five-week deadline.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.242
I know.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.578
We talk to the new creditor.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.076
Get an extension?

42:37.120 --> 42:38.439
(thunder rumbles)

42:42.320 --> 42:43.856
SIMONE:
Alicia.

42:43.890 --> 42:46.222
I'm so sorry we didn't get
to have that breakfast.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.659
Oh, me, too.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.896
You heading out?

42:48.930 --> 42:50.989
Yeah, Louis has
business, so...

42:51.030 --> 42:52.190
no rest.

42:52.230 --> 42:53.720
Be seeing you soon.

42:53.770 --> 42:55.169
And why's that?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.031
Oh, you didn't hear?

42:58.100 --> 43:00.967
I purchased
the Lockhart/Gardner debt.

43:01.010 --> 43:03.137
I'm your new creditor.

43:04.180 --> 43:05.807
You two will be working
together?

43:05.850 --> 43:06.908
That's fantastic.
