00:20.145 --> 00:23.649
In the Old Testament,
it's called the "Akedah."

00:24.274 --> 00:29.696
God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son,
Isaac, to prove his faith.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.283
And Abraham does it without a peep.

00:34.076 --> 00:39.206
That is,
until an angel of the Lord stays his hand.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.544
Abraham has passed his test,
and he is rewarded,

00:43.627 --> 00:46.255
becoming the father of a nation.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.299
Owen Cave faced his own Akedah,

00:49.883 --> 00:54.096
proving his faith in the law
by sacrificing his son.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.765
Which member
of the Menlo Park Police Department

00:56.849 --> 00:59.810
first identified your son
as the main suspect?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.397
I did.

01:03.897 --> 01:09.361
And, like Abraham,
Owen passed his test and was rewarded.

01:09.695 --> 01:14.533
In his case, rising to the highest office
to lead his department.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.290
Eighteen years, ten months, 24 days.

01:21.373 --> 01:25.752
That's how long Warren Cave has sat
in prison for the murder of Chuck Buhrman.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.173
But has the right Cave
been serving that time?

01:30.132 --> 01:32.467
Did Warren Cave come to believe

01:32.551 --> 01:36.180
that maybe his father's Akedah
wasn't just a test?

01:36.722 --> 01:40.684
Was he a sacrifice
for the sins of his father?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.641
That's not Niecey, is it? Your grandbaby?

03:03.058 --> 03:06.395
You've seen her more than her father.
Ain't that a bitch?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.647
You listen to your grandmother, okay?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.732
Don't wanna end up in here
like your daddy.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.609
All right now.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.152
Next.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.822
Poppy Parnell. To see Warren Cave.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.492
You don't have clearance.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.290
-Check again, please. P-A-R-N--
-It's plain as day, ma'am.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.417
You no longer have authorization
to visit this inmate

03:28.500 --> 03:30.460
or any other inmate in this facility.

03:30.794 --> 03:31.795
What?

03:32.254 --> 03:34.339
-On whose authority?
-Not my department.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.133
-Next.
-Can I leave a message?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.301
No.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.552
Look, I'm just trying to--

03:38.635 --> 03:42.222
I know what you're trying to do.
I don't give a shit.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.058
And your white boy got shanked.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.771
Step aside, please. Next.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.749
Where's Officer Hill?

04:08.832 --> 04:09.875
Somewhere else.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.587
The warden doesn't want you trying
to stay here longer than you have to.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.714
You're out on Saturday.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.970
I'm obligated to tell you we can release
you into protective custody or gen pop.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.347
Gen pop.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.391
You wouldn't last a day.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.977
That podcast
made you the homecoming queen.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.813
Gen pop.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.149
Sooner the better.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.989
Got it. It's your death warrant.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.956
Heard some reporter's crusading for you.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.127
Do you really think
you getting out of here?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.798
I used to think that.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.802
Pine box, my next home.

05:03.262 --> 05:07.933
I'm getting out,
but I'm never leaving these grounds.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.145
You ain't either.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.569
-Hey, Ingram, I need your help.
-What do you need?

05:22.364 --> 05:23.407
Thank you.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.245
-Good afternoon.
-Coffee?

05:29.413 --> 05:33.250
I was denied access to Warren Cave
at Quentin this morning.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.252
I need advice
on how to get back in to see him.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.379
Did they give you a reason why?

05:37.462 --> 05:40.424
-No. He was in the infirmary, but--
-Why?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.011
He was shanked by another prisoner.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.470
-"Shanked"?
-Stabbed.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.515
But that wasn't the reason for the denial
as far as I can tell.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.476
Do I have any legal recourse?

05:53.562 --> 05:54.563
No.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.359
Does the inmate's defense attorney
have any objection

05:59.443 --> 06:01.612
to you continuing to see the defendant?

06:02.196 --> 06:03.405
He doesn't have one.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.950
Well, his attorney could designate you
as an investigator for the defense team,

06:07.034 --> 06:09.369
therefore allowing you
continued access to the client.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.454
Would that work?

06:15.542 --> 06:16.752
We can look into it.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.840
It's not like Ingram
to stonewall me like that.

06:21.924 --> 06:25.052
At least that pretty young thing of his
had some good ideas.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.471
Her little slipup is useless though.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.308
It would take days to get to Warren like
that, and he's already been attacked once.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.520
Is there anyone you can check with
to at least find out if he's safe?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.146
Not at Quentin.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.025
I'm pretty sure Owen Cave
took away my clearance.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.362
What are you gonna do?

06:44.488 --> 06:48.575
There are zero degrees of separation
between the streets and prison.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.453
Drugs, phones, information.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.580
Penitentiary walls stop nothing.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.875
What?

06:58.544 --> 07:00.254
I always forget this side of you.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.382
It's always there just below the surface.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.093
Would your father help you with this?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.887
Not in a million and one years.

07:12.099 --> 07:16.270
There's a guy he used to trade
favors with. A biker named Jerbic.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.273
Daddy did a ton of business with him
back in the day.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.378
Hey.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.005
Let me ask you something.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.299
What the hell are you doing?

07:46.008 --> 07:47.885
Is that how you start conversations?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.095
Where you at, Pop?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.890
Heading over the bridge
to handle some business.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.977
Yeah. On Foothill Boulevard.
And don't lie. 'Cause Noa called me.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.021
I've been in worse places before.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.939
I'll be fine, Markus.

08:01.356 --> 08:05.027
Why are you playing death wish over
something you don't even know is true?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.278
I know.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.906
Only two people know,
and one of them is dead.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.116
-Listen.
-No, you listen.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.410
All this you're doing
tells me you ain't telling me the truth

08:13.493 --> 08:14.912
about a whole lot of shit.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.371
You know how I know?

08:16.955 --> 08:20.626
Because I used to be a cop,
and I used to be your man.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.078
I need to see Jerbic.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.081
I'm Shreve's daughter.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.668
Desiree?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.838
Poppy. His oldest.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.134
Let her in.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.315
Thank you.

09:26.441 --> 09:31.697
So you came in here alone
to parley on a hunch?

09:32.114 --> 09:35.826
I gambled that the history between
you and my father would mean something.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.244
Based on what?

09:38.453 --> 09:41.623
Well, you're one and the same. Outlaws.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.877
Different color though.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.465
Remember when you
got out of Quentin in '84?

09:51.383 --> 09:55.095
My father rode by your side
with all of the Capstones.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.891
Oakland remembers that shit.
The world remembers that shit.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.603
Two hundred motorcycles
clogging the highway.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.772
Black motorcycle captain riding with you.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.319
Remember you waved to me
at the back of that Monte Carlo

10:10.402 --> 10:12.321
when you gunned it
to the front of the line.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
Oh, shit.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.915
Why didn't Shreve hook this up?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.962
Because the man I'm trying to help
is Brotherhood.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.133
Journalism makes strange bedfellows.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.639
I'm trying to help someone whose life
may be in danger because of me.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.810
I need to get a message to him...
with your help.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.621
-Hey, Herbie.
-Hey, Poppy. You drinking?

11:03.789 --> 11:05.791
We keep this bottle here
especially for you.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.751
-I don't remember that kid.
-God.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.420
You remember.
The boy was slim as a whisper.

11:10.504 --> 11:14.258
Anyway, he's up on the roof when
he hears the gunshots, pow, pow, pow.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.969
So he starts shimmying up
to the drainpipe, right?

11:17.052 --> 11:18.804
By the time the shit had stopped,

11:18.887 --> 11:22.349
he had wedged himself so far up
under the thing he couldn't get out.

11:24.142 --> 11:28.856
We could not find his ass.
He was afraid to holler.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.941
His old lady was the one who found him.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.442
Then waltzed him in here talkin' about

11:32.526 --> 11:35.195
we need to break him off
a little more of the take.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.239
You know what? We did too.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.074
Keep her ass quiet.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.617
Hey, Daddy.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.328
Hey, sweetheart.
Did you come to see your sisters?

11:43.412 --> 11:45.289
Nope, I thought I'd come to see you.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.207
Coming to mass this Sunday?

11:47.291 --> 11:48.500
-Yup.
-Ingram?

11:50.878 --> 11:52.212
-Hey, Daddy.
-Oh, look at you.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.340
Hey! Lookit here.
I don't drop nothing but pretty babies.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.677
-What y'all talking about?
-Glory days.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.305
Oh, "Story of a Rebel" number 596?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.849
You don't believe people used to quake
when they heard my name?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.559
-They still do.
-There.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.269
See? That's what's up.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.521
So what happened to the fool on the roof?

12:09.605 --> 12:12.399
He got killed in a shoot-out
with the police about a year later.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.027
Whole club drove out to the funeral.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.988
Had East 14th shut down for ten miles.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.406
Who's that?

12:20.032 --> 12:21.033
Here we go.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.160
-Hello?
-Jerbic told me to call you.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.244
Excuse me, Daddy.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.290
I tried to visit you today,
and they told me you were attacked.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.958
Look, I don't have much time.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.460
I only have one question.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.968
Did you know about your mother's affair
with Chuck Buhrman?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.602
That's enough.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.069
Yes.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.279
How?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.750
I saw them together.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.461
I love you.

13:15.629 --> 13:16.630
Melanie.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.133
Did anyone else know about it?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.345
My father.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.182
Owen knew? Are you sure?

13:28.934 --> 13:30.352
He knew for months.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.021
Before the murder?

13:35.065 --> 13:36.066
Yeah.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.235
How do you know?

13:40.654 --> 13:41.655
I told him.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.334
What are you doing here?

13:54.418 --> 13:55.460
Why did you lie?

13:56.795 --> 13:59.840
-What are you talking about?
-Your affair with Chuck Buhrman.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.723
Did Owen know about the affair?

14:07.806 --> 14:09.474
Of course not.

14:09.558 --> 14:12.769
Isn't that the whole point?
Keeping it from your spouses.

14:14.479 --> 14:18.692
Owen had a rock-solid alibi,
if that's where you're headed.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.111
Did anyone else know?

14:24.156 --> 14:28.827
Erin suspected, but she suspected
any woman that came into Chuck's orbit.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.955
You believed Erin's alibi?

14:34.917 --> 14:38.295
Anyone who knew Erin
believed Erin's alibi.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.088
What would have been more unbelievable

14:40.172 --> 14:43.300
would be if she hadn't passed out drunk
for a night.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.583
Mom?

15:27.469 --> 15:28.470
What?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.056
Hey, you got a minute?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.391
Hell no.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.560
-What if I apologize?
-That's not good enough.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.687
-That was some foul shit you pulled.
-Markus.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.605
No. Going to that club,
hanging up on me like that.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.816
You think you got the right to act
any old kind of way with me?

15:40.899 --> 15:44.486
-Look, Owen knew about the affair.
-Hey, I don't give a shit.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.446
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, sir.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.032
Well, that's motive.
No matter what you think.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.450
Apologize.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.746
-Bye, Poppy.
-I'm sorry.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.000
Oh, yeah? What for?

15:59.501 --> 16:01.837
For hanging up
when you were just trying to help out.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.797
And?

16:03.881 --> 16:06.175
Well, I'm not gonna apologize
for pursuing a lead,

16:06.258 --> 16:07.342
so you can just let that go.

16:07.426 --> 16:11.430
I've been doing this for 20 years
and in worse places than I was last night.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.932
Warren confirmed that Owen knew
about the affair.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.477
Yeah, but you're still ignoring the fact
that he has an alibi, a rock-solid one.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.605
He was on duty that night.
He couldn't have done it.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.815
-Could someone have covered for him?
-Listen to me.

16:21.899 --> 16:26.069
First rule of investigation is you do not
get emotionally attached to the outcome.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.238
That's what turns cops into sloppy cops.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.202
Well, just because he was on duty
doesn't mean he couldn't have done it.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.369
Let me tell you something.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.372
You cannot will him to be a suspect,
Poppy.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.082
You understand that?

16:39.583 --> 16:43.545
This is your golden opportunity to say
"I told you so."

16:43.629 --> 16:46.173
How many of those do you think
you're gonna get in this lifetime?

16:48.926 --> 16:51.261
All right. All right, I'm on it.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.555
But the next time you hang up on me,
we're gonna have--

16:54.056 --> 16:55.057
Hello?

17:01.563 --> 17:02.773
So who told you?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.900
All that matters is it wasn't you.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.194
Why would I call you?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.445
Because my sister died.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.867
Because you were in the car, apparently.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.207
Because of that bullshit podcast about us.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.333
So you know about that.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.295
About the podcast about my dead husband?
Yeah, someone thought to mention it to me.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.006
So is that why you're here?

17:28.423 --> 17:29.508
Because I haven't seen you

17:29.591 --> 17:33.011
since you showed up shit-faced
at the hospital when my daughter was born,

17:33.095 --> 17:34.930
so I know you're not here to pay respects.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.682
All right, you got me, baby.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.977
I'm not here for the podcast,
I'm not here for the funeral,

17:40.060 --> 17:41.645
I'm here for what's mine.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.273
Susan took the house we grew up in.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.943
She took my daughter, she took my life,
and I want it all back.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.736
Yeah, you want me back?

17:52.990 --> 17:54.616
Let's just start with the house.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.578
You're such a bitch.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.746
Yeah, well,
where do you think you got it from?

17:59.830 --> 18:03.166
Believe me,
I know exactly where I got it from.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.545
Yup, that's why your sister left you.

18:07.129 --> 18:10.591
Just took off.
Couldn't stand one more day of you.

18:17.556 --> 18:18.557
Hey, Armand.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.684
What's up, man?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.936
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Hold on, man.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.153
I see you're still hitting up
the two for two.

18:31.987 --> 18:33.655
Guess we're all creatures of habit, right?

18:33.739 --> 18:35.115
It was one drink.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.783
You know it's a slippery slope, man.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.870
What do you need, Markus?

18:40.370 --> 18:43.165
Look, I'm still trying to get my hands
on those call logs.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.541
I can't help you.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.502
Cave is the chief of police.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.755
-All I need you to do--
-You're not a cop anymore, remember?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.882
Stop trying to trade off it.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.902
You were asleep
when I got home last night.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.279
And gone before you woke up this morning.

19:18.367 --> 19:21.245
-You wanna do this now or later?
-Why did you lie yesterday?

19:22.538 --> 19:25.916
I was managing your expectations.
All I could do-- Where are you going?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.209
You were trying to cut me off.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.545
-Step carefully.
-Oh. "Step--"

19:39.388 --> 19:41.765
Daddy, Lil, is everything okay?

19:41.849 --> 19:43.600
What'd you need the Red Saints for?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.188
For a story I'm doing.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.815
For that silly-ass radio show?

19:49.898 --> 19:50.899
What story?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.694
I needed to get to someone on the inside.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.988
So you traded on my name?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.031
There's no hiding from me.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.617
-I wasn't trying to hide--
-Jerbic is a piece of shit.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.202
I haven't dealt with him in over a decade.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.954
-I didn't know that.
-Of course you didn't.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.914
'Cause this ain't your world anymore.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.041
-What's going on?
-You know what Jerbic did?

20:08.709 --> 20:11.086
He called me, happy as shit.
You know what he said?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.839
"Your daughter cashed in
one of your chips."

20:13.922 --> 20:16.258
I don't like owing motherfuckers. Hear me?

20:17.259 --> 20:19.469
What you do out here costs me.

20:20.179 --> 20:24.433
Whatever your last name is now,
when you in the Bay, you a Scoville.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.643
You need to act like you know that.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.771
-That's enough. She hears you.
-Now it's enough. Where you been?

20:29.855 --> 20:32.149
Letting your wife run around
like she ain't got no sense.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.442
Old man, this is my house.

20:33.525 --> 20:36.153
I didn't realize
that I overstepped my bounds.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.071
Why didn't you ask me?

20:42.409 --> 20:43.952
White boy then?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.333
AB.

20:57.174 --> 21:00.844
You are stepping in some shit
you got no business being around.

21:07.184 --> 21:09.061
And I never heard, "I'm sorry."

21:26.411 --> 21:28.622
I made an appointment
with a Realtor for tomorrow.

21:28.705 --> 21:32.376
But realistically, when can we sell
this place? We just have to clean it out.

21:33.794 --> 21:34.962
That's not possible.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.422
What do you mean?

21:38.590 --> 21:40.384
Have either of you spoken to Josie?

21:41.718 --> 21:42.719
No.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.429
Josie's the executor.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.557
The title can only be transferred to her.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.102
What if she's dead?

21:51.937 --> 21:54.314
Then there are steps we would take
with the state.

21:54.398 --> 21:57.317
But that would obviously require proof.

21:57.401 --> 21:58.735
Have you spoken to her?

21:58.819 --> 22:01.613
-Excuse me?
-Have you talked to Josie?

22:02.614 --> 22:04.867
I represent Susan Carver's estate.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.828
That's all I'm at liberty
to disclose to you at this time.

22:29.725 --> 22:32.102
I couldn't get a single thing done today.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.813
All I could think about was Shreve and Lil

22:34.897 --> 22:36.815
rolling into my house
like Bonnie and Clyde.

22:36.899 --> 22:37.900
I'm praying.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.613
I'm sorry about Daddy and Lil,
but this is not the place.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.998
Why are you sorry? Tell me.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.001
Are you sorry because you were caught?

22:56.084 --> 22:59.671
Are you sorry because you're trying
to free a man who is Aryan Brotherhood?

22:59.755 --> 23:01.757
Are you sorry
because you're just telling me about it?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.051
Do you wanna listen or do you wanna fight?

23:04.134 --> 23:05.344
Fight! I wanna fight!

23:05.427 --> 23:08.430
From what I've seen, fighting is the thing
that works in your family!

23:08.514 --> 23:10.724
Okay, we should talk
when we both have calmed down.

23:10.807 --> 23:14.645
-Whoa, whoa. Both? Are you serious?
-Yes, dead serious.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.481
Did you lie to me
in front of your colleagues?

23:18.357 --> 23:22.402
You know what? Yes. I did.
The man was shanked.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.988
So sue me for trying to protect
my wife from a situation--

23:25.072 --> 23:28.200
I wasn't in danger.
I grew up in and out of places like that.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.077
This fancy shit's what's new to me.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.454
Okay. Okay.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.416
Even your father told you to stop.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.419
Suddenly you and Daddy
are on the same page?

23:39.503 --> 23:43.048
-I understand where he's coming from.
-Where exactly is that?

23:43.131 --> 23:46.510
Because this is what I've always done!
This is who I have always been!

23:46.844 --> 23:47.845
This is my job!

23:47.928 --> 23:51.098
And nobody understands that more than me!

23:54.393 --> 23:55.394
Look.

23:55.853 --> 24:00.065
There is out there and there is in here.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.194
They need to be worlds apart.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.074
You're right.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.245
I hear what you're saying, okay?
I'm sorry.

24:14.830 --> 24:15.873
I'm sorry.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.878
But that is my "in here."

24:20.961 --> 24:23.672
And we can fight anywhere else
in this house but there.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.593
If we can agree on that, then cool.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.721
Cool.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.311
Come on, pass it around.
Come on, what you doing?

24:37.394 --> 24:40.439
All right, J. We got a mouse in the house,
J. Mouse in the house.

24:40.522 --> 24:44.067
That's what I'm talking about.
Been waiting for him to do that all day.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.152
Let's go.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.240
Creatures of habit.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.953
I listened to that podcast.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.917
I don't wanna be on the wrong side
of history when all this shakes down.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.591
-And what I said before about--
-Hey, hey, hey.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.885
Forget about that. All right?

25:10.928 --> 25:11.929
We good.

25:14.306 --> 25:15.307
My man.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.154
Hey.

25:30.739 --> 25:31.823
You good?

25:33.075 --> 25:34.201
Yeah, fine.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.162
Question for you.

25:37.621 --> 25:39.873
Should I ask for an advance
on the book deal now

25:39.957 --> 25:41.458
or lobby for points on the back end?

25:41.542 --> 25:42.668
What did you find?

25:42.751 --> 25:46.046
'Cause, you know, the job is all right,
but it's not that all right.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.673
Stop. What did you find?

25:48.215 --> 25:50.968
All right, all right.
Owen's alibi is fishy.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.136
He wasn't on duty.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.597
Oh, no, no, no. He was. All night.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.891
-But...
-You motherfucker.

25:59.101 --> 26:01.854
One of his calls
was a disturbing the peace call.

26:02.938 --> 26:03.939
And?

26:04.606 --> 26:08.151
Look, he took the call at 3:30 a.m.

26:08.861 --> 26:12.531
And he didn't show up
to his next call until 4:44.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.118
That was in the window
of when Chuck was murdered.

26:16.535 --> 26:19.913
If you were to ask a humble man,
such as myself, he would tell you

26:19.997 --> 26:23.333
there's no way in hell a disturbing
the peace call should take 74 minutes.

26:23.417 --> 26:24.668
Something's off.

26:25.085 --> 26:28.046
I knew it. I knew it. Thank you.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.756
You're welcome, Poppy.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.926
I knew it.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.646
Hi.

26:45.439 --> 26:47.566
I know that you are in contact with Josie,

26:47.649 --> 26:50.319
and I was just wondering
if you would give this to her.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.321
Please.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.991
I'm not asking you
to betray attorney-client privilege.

27:01.371 --> 27:02.372
Please.

27:09.171 --> 27:10.422
Thank you.

27:12.466 --> 27:16.261
This is me leaving.
Not asking for anything else.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.888
Boundaries.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.836
Oh, my God.

28:33.881 --> 28:35.007
How did you find me?

28:36.383 --> 28:37.384
Josie.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.887
Josie, Josie.

28:41.305 --> 28:42.306
Josie.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.147
Basketball fantasy camp?

28:51.106 --> 28:53.650
Missing two days
at a Palo Alto private school

28:53.734 --> 28:56.486
is like missing a month anywhere else.

28:56.570 --> 28:58.238
I promise I won't fall behind.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.574
Come on, Alana.

29:00.991 --> 29:04.244
Give the kid a special memory
with his old man.

29:06.455 --> 29:08.749
Hey, you speak to your teachers.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.959
And you get every assignment
ahead of time.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.461
-Yes.
-I can't believe this.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.840
Come on, baby. Yeah!

29:19.760 --> 29:22.262
-Chief Cave.
-What the hell are you doing here?

29:22.846 --> 29:25.557
You came to my house,
so I thought I'd pay you a visit.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.392
Dad, breakfast.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.103
I'll be right there, son.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.606
Son? A spare.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.401
What are you doing here?

29:40.614 --> 29:42.115
I saw them together.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.576
Did anyone else know about it?

29:44.660 --> 29:45.661
My father.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.913
Owen knew? Are you sure?

29:48.330 --> 29:49.790
He knew for months.

29:49.873 --> 29:51.458
Before the murder?

29:51.542 --> 29:52.626
Yeah.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.002
How do you know?

29:54.419 --> 29:55.629
I told him.

29:58.632 --> 30:01.468
-What do you want?
-You on my podcast.

30:01.552 --> 30:03.011
-You don't need me.
-Oh, but I want you.

30:03.095 --> 30:04.847
You have the trial transcripts,
the police record--

30:04.930 --> 30:06.515
You had motive, you had opportunity.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.809
Now I'm giving you the opportunity
to explain yourself--

30:08.892 --> 30:11.228
You cannot play that,
and you cannot use my name.

30:11.311 --> 30:12.855
Oh, you watch.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.776
-You're on a very hazardous road.
-For who?

30:17.860 --> 30:19.611
You. And let's be clear about that.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.781
-This is dangerous for you.
-Are you threatening me?

30:22.865 --> 30:25.617
No. I'm telling you.
You've crossed a line, and you'll pay.

30:26.243 --> 30:27.536
That's a promise.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.676
-Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
-I'll take another fugazi.

30:42.759 --> 30:45.804
Come on, that's what I'm saying.
It was the same Blue

30:45.888 --> 30:48.515
that came up from LA
before he went to 'Nam.

30:48.599 --> 30:49.892
No, that's a different Blue.

30:49.975 --> 30:52.352
I'm talking about the Blue
from Arkansas who had that Lincoln.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.314
Lincoln? It was a Coupe de Ville.
Come on, brother.

30:55.397 --> 30:56.690
Oh, hell no.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.901
Hey, what is going on?

30:58.984 --> 31:01.904
This is a summons for Shreve Scoville
to appear in 30 days.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.447
We've included a list of violations.

31:03.530 --> 31:06.116
Hey, whoa, whoa. I'm taking care of this.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.993
Didn't you talk to Lance
before you came in here?

31:08.076 --> 31:09.870
This isn't Lance's jurisdiction.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.497
Complaints were made. We pulled paperwork.

31:12.915 --> 31:16.126
You got a litany of violations from
faulty wiring to derelict liquor license.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.962
-You know you didn't have to run in here.
-Don't step toward him.

31:19.463 --> 31:22.841
-Hey. Hey! That's my wife.
-What the fuck?

31:22.925 --> 31:26.178
The Whisper Lounge and that kale factory
down the street never comply with--

31:26.261 --> 31:28.180
Ma'am, if you continue to be aggressive,
I will cite you--

31:28.263 --> 31:30.349
"Aggressive" is you coming in here
acting like it's a raid

31:30.432 --> 31:32.142
when you need to hand over some paperwork.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.270
Cydie Scoville?

31:36.021 --> 31:37.022
Yeah?

31:38.982 --> 31:40.484
Cydie Scoville, you're under arrest.

31:40.567 --> 31:43.111
What? For what?

31:43.195 --> 31:45.447
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

31:45.531 --> 31:46.907
-Take it easy.
-Daddy.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.952
-Let's go.
-Cydie, we'll fix this. Just stay calm.

31:50.035 --> 31:52.496
-Can we know what's going on?
-She has an outstanding warrant.

31:52.579 --> 31:55.999
For traffic tickets. OPD don't even
respond to grand theft auto anymore.

31:56.083 --> 31:58.293
Since when are you enforcing
misdemeanor warrants?

31:58.377 --> 32:00.254
Where's your other daughter, the reporter?

32:00.879 --> 32:02.631
'Cause we were hoping she would be here.

32:03.799 --> 32:05.801
Tell her Owen Cave sends his best.

32:07.845 --> 32:08.846
Let's go.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.868
Put your feet on the red line.
I'm gonna pat you down.

32:32.703 --> 32:33.871
Spread your legs.

32:35.706 --> 32:38.000
And stick your left hand
on the wall for me.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.087
Put your right hand on the wall.

32:57.394 --> 32:58.854
Take a seat on the bench, please.

33:07.529 --> 33:08.780
Six rings?

33:13.076 --> 33:14.453
Please remove your lashes.

33:19.708 --> 33:20.834
And your makeup.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.099
We need another bag for the wig.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.397
I'm gonna have you
wipe your hands together for me.

33:46.401 --> 33:49.446
Go ahead and take a step up.
Let me see your right thumb.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.662
Do me a favor. Take a step to the left.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.122
And fingers together just like this.

34:09.049 --> 34:12.052
Yo, Officer, it's a bail hearing.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.179
Yeah. Don't cry, muffin!

34:44.793 --> 34:47.754
Take this form.
Have a seat and we'll process her out.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.227
Did you pay?

35:02.853 --> 35:03.854
We did.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.190
She should be out in a minute.

35:08.483 --> 35:11.987
-You should've called me.
-Why? Ingram's the lawyer.

35:14.364 --> 35:17.201
And we called who we meant to call.

35:21.747 --> 35:22.998
Oh, my God.

35:29.588 --> 35:30.589
Cydie.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.133
Daddy, my hair.

35:34.092 --> 35:35.260
Come here, baby.

35:44.228 --> 35:46.355
What the fuck did you do?

35:46.897 --> 35:47.898
Nothing, Daddy.

35:47.981 --> 35:50.984
You ain't been back but a minute
and already going to Jerbic.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.778
They raided my bar.

35:53.362 --> 35:54.655
And your sister...

35:56.031 --> 35:57.032
Come here.

36:03.205 --> 36:05.165
-That cop did this.
-What?

36:05.249 --> 36:07.793
That cop, Cave.
He did this because of you.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.629
-You don't know that, Daddy.
-The one who arrested Cydie told me so.

36:11.713 --> 36:12.881
I don't know why he would--

36:13.799 --> 36:16.218
-What are you doing?
-Everything you leave out is a lie.

36:16.301 --> 36:18.929
-Get your goddamn hands off my wife.
-Don't talk to him like that.

36:19.012 --> 36:20.931
-Babe.
-What is wrong with you?

36:21.014 --> 36:22.641
-Come on, babe.
-What is wrong with you?

36:22.724 --> 36:24.852
-Come on, babe. Come on, baby.
-All of you!

36:56.425 --> 37:01.597
In the time since I initially recorded
the opening of this episode,

37:02.222 --> 37:03.849
things have changed.

37:05.267 --> 37:06.685
If I'm honest...

37:07.853 --> 37:12.858
the pursuit of this podcast
is not fueled solely

37:12.941 --> 37:18.113
by the guilt that I may have helped
put Warren Cave in prison unjustly.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.115
It ain't nothing, baby. She'll be--

37:20.199 --> 37:24.745
I realize now that I identify with Warren.

37:24.828 --> 37:25.829
Yo, Shreve!

37:25.913 --> 37:28.540
Because I've been sacrificed myself.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.586
Don't cry. You hear me?

37:33.337 --> 37:35.881
Nobody cares about
a little black girl's tears.

37:36.673 --> 37:39.468
I know what it feels like
to lie on that altar

37:39.551 --> 37:41.803
and see that knife raised up

37:42.262 --> 37:46.558
and wonder if you're being sacrificed
for some higher good

37:46.642 --> 37:50.145
or if you're just a casualty
of someone else's ambition.

37:51.021 --> 37:52.439
I survived.

37:52.898 --> 37:54.441
Warren survived.

37:56.068 --> 37:57.611
But even if you survive,

37:57.694 --> 38:00.489
even if you get down
off that altar alive...

38:01.990 --> 38:04.910
you are never the same again.

38:07.829 --> 38:09.039
Hey, buddy.

38:09.873 --> 38:12.918
Wondered if you'd be back
now that you're famous.

38:13.001 --> 38:15.712
I thought they'd have your ass protected.

38:16.588 --> 38:17.798
I ain't a pussy.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.345
Man, you should see this shit.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.937
You're gonna give that shit back, right?

38:32.813 --> 38:34.565
People need to see you step up.

38:39.236 --> 38:41.154
The people will get their show.
