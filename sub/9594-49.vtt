WEBVTT

00:22.156 --> 00:24.325
I call this
H.I.V.E meeting to order.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.328
Now, it's no secret that
we've had a rough time.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.063
The Titans
are everywhere we turn,

00:29.097 --> 00:31.699
thwarting our schemes,
ruining our lives.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.201
But not for much longer,

00:33.234 --> 00:34.602
because my latest plan...

00:35.803 --> 00:37.105
One sec. Hello?

00:37.138 --> 00:40.108
Hello, is Fred there?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.176
Sorry, you got
the wrong number.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.746
As I was saying,
we will no longer
be at the mercy of the Titans.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.680
Thanks to my latest plan...

00:46.714 --> 00:49.083
Hello?

00:49.117 --> 00:53.221
Hi, I am calling for the Fred.
Is he in?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.255
Wrong number!

00:54.288 --> 00:56.624
The era of the Teen Titans
will come to an end,

00:56.657 --> 00:58.792
-thanks to my latest plan...

00:58.826 --> 01:00.694
Who is it?

01:00.728 --> 01:04.265
Good afternoon, sir.
Can I talk to Fred?

01:04.298 --> 01:06.667
There's no Fred here!

01:07.635 --> 01:09.437
-My latest plan...

01:09.470 --> 01:12.206
-Yo, yo, yo! This be Fred.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.174
Anyone call for me?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.150
The Titans?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.254
I hate those guys!

01:26.287 --> 01:28.422
So let's hear your latest plan
to crush 'em.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.124
You know what? Forget it.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.160
I can't deal with
those jerks today.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.261
I have a new plan.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.196
Let's take the day off.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.132
How about instead, we launch
a swarm of jerk-seeking
murder missiles?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.900
No.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.803
Could retrain and release
a vicious pack of
jerk

01:42.836 --> 01:44.272
No.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.274
Spray the city with
jerk

01:46.307 --> 01:50.844
No! What we need
is a quiet day
of rest and relaxation.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.746
I get it.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.783
Rest, relax, let the Titans
think we've gone soft
and then, boom!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.918
We hit them with
the murder missiles!

01:59.187 --> 02:00.120
Yes, sir, jim-dandy!

02:00.154 --> 02:01.455
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, yeah!

02:01.489 --> 02:02.823
No murder missiles.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.193
It's a day off.
No chaos, no crime.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.462
Just enjoy yourselves,
and if you see the Titans
do not engage.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.930
What if they see us?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
Do not engage.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.701
What if we see each other
at the same time?

02:13.734 --> 02:16.204
I said, "Do not engage."

02:16.237 --> 02:18.339
We can't let them upset us!

02:22.543 --> 02:24.245
Hello!

02:24.278 --> 02:26.180
Oh, yes, hello.
Do you have any olive oil
in the house?

02:26.214 --> 02:30.184
-Well, you better let her go
before Popeye gets mad.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.386
-Boom!

02:32.420 --> 02:34.255
Olives are the funny.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.925
Rest. Relax. Day off.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.260
No Titans.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.194
Meeting adjourned.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.203
Hey, See-More!

02:49.237 --> 02:51.972
I didn't know you were
an artiste.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.208
All right! Not bad.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.214
Hmm, you made this weirdo
look good.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.215
-Now, draw me.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.387
But can you do me a solid
and give me a discount?

03:07.288 --> 03:08.622
Just kidding, dude.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.393
No, but really,
I only have five bucks on me.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.528
What is that

03:14.562 --> 03:16.697
That's easy,
anyone can draw a circle.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.967
How about like this?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.338
Ahh!

03:24.372 --> 03:27.341
So, what you got now?
Hmm... Mmm.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.644
Not bad, but how about
one of those funny,
tiny bodies?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.414
Yeah.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.249
Ooh. Tinier.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.284
Funnier.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.587
Give me more muscle.
Oh! Make me holding Jinx.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.489
Yeah, yeah,
but give me more muscles.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.457
Yeah.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.826
Ah! Make me surfing.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.396
But, like, on a shark.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.398
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Make the shark Beastie!

03:52.366 --> 03:54.435
Hair! Give me cool hair!

03:54.468 --> 03:56.304
Give me more muscle.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.771
A shark. Beastie. Jinx.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.876
What?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.647
That doesn't look
anything like me.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.749
Mmm-mmm.
This guy's a terrible artist.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.320
-Move it along.
Don't waste your money.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.255
Curse you, Cyborg!

04:21.629 --> 04:23.764
-Ahhh!

04:30.971 --> 04:33.541
-You and I
have a lot in common.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.443
-We're sleek, we're cuddly.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.511
And best of all,
we're bad luck.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.880
-Come on.
Let's have some fun.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.505
Jinx, are you
currently engaging
in the criminal misdeeds?

05:04.538 --> 05:05.539
Are you planning the heist?

05:05.573 --> 05:07.074
Are you walking the jay?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.342
Answer me.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.477
Do not engage.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.645
Ooh, kitty!

05:11.679 --> 05:13.381
-Ooh.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.516
Hey! That's not your cat!

05:15.549 --> 05:17.585
Oh, is she the yours?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.653
She's an alley cat.
No one owns her.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.589
I see. In that case,

05:21.622 --> 05:23.824
we will act in accordance
with the Law of Felines

05:23.857 --> 05:26.794
and let the kitty decide
who she will play with.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.497
-BOTH: Here, kitty!

05:29.530 --> 05:31.599
-Kitty, here. Come here!
-Come to Starfire, kitty.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.634
-Come Here! Come here!
-Come to Starfire, Kitty.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.503
-Come here! Come here!
-Kitty!

05:35.536 --> 05:36.570
Joy!

05:36.604 --> 05:38.572
* Oh, kitty, kitty, kitty
time, time

05:38.606 --> 05:41.409
* Oh, the kitty, kitty time
Meow, meow, meow *

05:41.442 --> 05:43.544
Oh, how I love the kitties!

05:43.577 --> 05:45.979
Well, I hate you,
and I hate the Titans.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.548
Meow!

06:06.366 --> 06:09.470
You call that dancing, bro?
Watch this!

06:09.503 --> 06:11.839
MAN: * One, two, three,
hit me! *

06:15.743 --> 06:17.778
-CROWD: Whoa!

07:01.054 --> 07:02.122
Beast Boy.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.162
Anyone up for a little game?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.599
ALL: Yes, sir. I could play.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.600
Let's pick teams.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.768
Only if I can pick first.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.870
Ooh, this is tough.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.573
-I'll take Billy.
-Yee-haw!

07:19.607 --> 07:21.174
Hey, I was gonna pick Billy.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.811
-I'll take Billy.
-Whoo!

07:23.844 --> 07:25.078
-I'll take Billy.
-I'll take Billy.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.179
-I'll take Billy.
-I'll take Billy.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.148
I'll take Billy.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.784
Man, why am I
always picked last?

07:33.220 --> 07:37.257
Looks like it's gonna be
a bea-utiful day
for a ball game.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.627
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

07:39.660 --> 07:41.762
Hot dogs! Hot dogs here!

07:44.598 --> 07:46.900
Stee-rike three! You're out!

07:46.934 --> 07:50.070
Out
He missed by a mile.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.171
Are you blind?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.573
I've had enough.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.575
You are out of here!

07:54.608 --> 07:56.844
ALL: Boo!

07:56.877 --> 07:59.880
BILLY:
Here's the wind up
and the pitch.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.550
Back, back, back, back, back.
And it's gone!

08:02.583 --> 08:03.884
Home run!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.052
ALL: Whoo!

08:06.119 --> 08:07.154
Ow!

08:14.227 --> 08:17.197
You have disturbed
my afternoon reading,

08:17.230 --> 08:19.667
and now you shall pay!

08:37.050 --> 08:39.820
Man, the Titans
ruin everything.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.762
Today, Gizmo, we walk tall.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.670
* Let's do it again

09:38.712 --> 09:40.781
Gizmo, I know it's you.

09:40.814 --> 09:44.051
Ah, no, man.
I don't know any Gizmos.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.687
You can't fool me,
you little miscreant.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.988
It's not what you think.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.891
Ow!

09:53.226 --> 09:54.662
It's my day off!

09:54.695 --> 09:56.830
Ow! I just wanted to
have a good time.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.866
And be tall!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.969
Oh. Very well.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.739
Titans!

10:05.773 --> 10:08.141
GIZMO: So, is everyone
rested and relaxed?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.012
Good, because I have
a new plan.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.648
-One sec.

10:14.682 --> 10:18.251
Yes, hello. Is Cole there?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.253
Yeah, uh, Cole.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.789
Last name...

10:21.822 --> 10:23.256
Last name, Cuts.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.358
Cold cuts!

10:25.392 --> 10:27.795
Like lunch meat!
