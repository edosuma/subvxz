00:02.800 --> 00:04.131
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.280 --> 00:07.284
Does Elena enjoy having
both of you worship at her altar?

00:07.480 --> 00:11.929
I've heard about you. The crazy, impulsive
vampire, in love with his brother's girl.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.641
- I wanted you to have this.
- Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.610
- I can't give up on you, Stefan.
- It's done.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.286
I don't wanna see you.
I don't wanna be with you.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.561
- Daddy?
- I'm conditioning you...

00:24.720 --> 00:28.645
- ...to associate vampirism with pain.
- Hello, Bill.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.525
- Hybrid out to make more hybrids?
- What am I doing wrong?

00:31.680 --> 00:35.401
- Contact the witch who created it.
- That would be the Original Witch.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.130
Bring me Rebekah. She has what I need.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.009
Time to wake up, little sister.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.722
It's beautiful.
- A witch gave it to me.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.601
- What do you have that Gloria needs?
- Where's my necklace?

00:46.760 --> 00:49.411
Tell me that's not what she needs!

00:59.240 --> 01:01.481
<i>If you wanna do it
We can do it right</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:06.451
<i>I can see you coming home
'Cause you're ready to go</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:09.365
<i>'Cause I'm ready to go</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:13.130
<i>I'm ready to go, if you say so</i>

01:13.280 --> 01:15.089
There has to be more to this dress.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.969
There's not.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.250
<i>I'm ready to go</i>

01:19.400 --> 01:22.961
So women in the 21st century
dress like prostitutes, then?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.361
I got dirty looks for wearing trousers.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.131
You wore trousers so women today
could wear nothing.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.442
This music sounds like
a cable car accident.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.489
It's dance music.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.608
- People dance to this?
- Hm.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.444
Are we done?

01:36.600 --> 01:38.568
And why are you so grumpy?

01:38.720 --> 01:42.566
I needed one thing from you for my witch
to find out why my hybrids were dying.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.530
Your necklace.
And you lost it.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.767
I didn't lose it.
It's just been missing for 90 years.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.445
So, what do you think?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.370
I like it.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.490
- What? I said I like it.
- I can always tell when you're lying.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.850
- Nice one. Good work.
- You pulled the dagger out of her.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.162
I heard that.
- Ugh.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.449
All right.
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.931
I don't know why you wanna
bring chili to a potluck.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.684
Everybody brings chili.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.126
- Hey, Ric.
- What's up?

02:42.280 --> 02:44.601
What time do you wanna
go to the Lockwood party?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.410
Founder's parties aren't my thing.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.251
There are gonna be
nine other people that brought chili.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.084
It's an old family recipe, okay?

02:51.240 --> 02:55.131
Yeah, I know. I knew your old family.
They made sucky chili.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.247
- Why are you here, exactly?
- She knows.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.768
He thinks I'm gonna break.
I'm not going to break.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.367
I'm gonna keep making chili,
pretend like I didn't spend the summer...

03:08.520 --> 03:11.000
looking for someone
who didn't wanna be found.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.401
- She's in denial.
- I'm not in denial.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.641
No?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.289
You're still wearing this necklace.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.483
Isn't this a reminder of your
unbreakable bond with Stefan?

03:33.040 --> 03:35.088
What the hell are you doing here?

03:35.240 --> 03:36.401
You two look chummy.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.050
Klaus your new bestie?

03:38.480 --> 03:40.721
If he finds out you're in Chicago,
you're dead.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.769
Happy to know that you still care.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.686
Rebekah's
necklace that Klaus is looking for...

03:46.840 --> 03:49.411
that's the necklace you gave Elena.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.727
- Bye, Katherine.
- Hey, hey. Wait.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.407
You're up to something. Tell me.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.644
They don't know where the necklace is.
I have to keep them from figuring it out.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.081
I have it all under control.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.562
Please tell me you have a better plan
than that. You do.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.529
Come on, Stefan,
you're not the diabolical type.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.842
Whatever you're planning,
it's not gonna work.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.163
If the most diabolical woman
I know can't seem to figure it out...

04:16.320 --> 04:18.447
then I must be doing
something right.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.442
Uh-huh. I forgot. You're bad now.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.205
Don't get too cocky.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.364
Klaus is smarter than you.
He's smarter than everyone.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.047
And I've heard about that sister.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.601
Be careful. She'll ruin you.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.240
Happy to know you still care.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.241
Jeremy.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.565
Anna?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.370
- You heard me?
- What are you doing?

04:55.560 --> 04:57.050
"Heard me" heard me, or did it...?

04:57.240 --> 04:59.402
- Where have you been?
- I need to know you can hear me.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.847
You tell me not to trust Vicki,
then disappear.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.527
- Jeremy, tell me you can hear me.
- Yeah, I can hear you, all right?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.330
What the hell?

05:09.480 --> 05:13.246
- What is it?
- I've been trying to get you to hear me.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.051
- Yelling your name, screaming.
- You have?

05:18.160 --> 05:21.403
What changed?
I've been trying to get through to you.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.281
- Why now?
- I was dreaming about you.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.286
<i>L...</i>

05:31.800 --> 05:33.325
You were dreaming about me?

05:41.360 --> 05:45.922
I can't believe this is actually happening,
you're actually here.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.450
I'm here.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.325
I come bearing gifts.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.887
Please say that's not chili.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.923
- Bonnie.
- I'm back!

06:08.600 --> 06:12.446
I leave town for the summer and
everything goes to hell for both of you'?

06:14.560 --> 06:15.846
Bonnie.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.246
Jeremy.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.122
So Mayor Lockwood
called your gay ex-husband...

06:36.280 --> 06:38.567
to torture your vampire daughter?

06:38.720 --> 06:40.563
Yes. I've been keeping him detained...

06:40.720 --> 06:45.123
to make sure the vervain's out of
his system, so you can, you know...

06:45.440 --> 06:47.442
- Can't we just kill him?
- No, Damon.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.080
- He's Caroline's father.
- Sounds like a douche bag.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.288
Just because you and I
are on okay terms...

06:52.440 --> 06:56.650
doesn't mean I'm suddenly
a big advocate for your lifestyle.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.531
Is that what you told him
when you two got divorced?

07:04.920 --> 07:08.003
Double-check him for vervain
before you compel him.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.687
Ah!

07:23.960 --> 07:27.043
- Brought another vampire in?
- It's the best thing for all of us.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.046
So, Bill, I hear you're into the whole
daddy-daughter, vampire-torture thing.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.929
I was trying to help her.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.966
Well, if there's anyone
who doesn't need help...

07:37.120 --> 07:39.805
it's your annoying control-freak
of a daughter.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.041
Hm.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.202
- Yep. He's vervain free.
- Just erase his memory, Damon.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.644
Bill, I have a question.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.247
What makes you think that you can
change the basic nature of a vampire?

07:58.480 --> 08:00.244
The mind's a powerful tool.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.926
It can be trained and retrained.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.243
- You just have to be strong enough.
Mm-hm.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.764
I completely agree.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.487
I actually happen
to love mind-control myself.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.601
You'll leave town immediately.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.084
All you'll remember is you came to bring
your daughter back-to-school shopping.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.921
- You left us.
- Yeah, sorry.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.367
Retail therapy was making
my head explode.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.760
Tell me about it.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.445
- What's she doing?
- Failing.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.284
Hard to find something
without anything to go on.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.126
So use me.
I only wore it for 1000 years.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.760
See? Now this one offers a solution.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.361
All right, give me your hand,
sweetheart.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.965
She's, uh...
She's looking for the necklace, huh?

08:51.120 --> 08:53.691
The problem with my dad's
normal side of the family...

08:53.880 --> 08:56.042
is normal made for
a really boring summer.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.809
After the last few days,
I would kill for a normal family.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.651
- When did you learn to cook?
- Damon helped a little.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.765
- Damon's helping you cook?
- Both of you, stop judging.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.491
He's just trying to be a good... Ah!

09:10.120 --> 09:13.044
- Did I splash you?
- No. No, my necklace.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.004
I can sense something.

09:20.640 --> 09:21.801
It burned me.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.481
- A sign you shouldn't be wearing it.
- Caroline.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.167
What? I'm just saying. If you're
gonna be cooking without Stefan...

09:35.600 --> 09:37.807
Let me see it.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.331
I found it.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.207
- So where is it?
- It doesn't work like that, doll.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.603
I get images.
There's a girl with her friends.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.525
A dead girl with dead friends,
if I don't get my necklace.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.762
I have to dive back in
and get the details.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.207
- So dive.
- I need more time.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.202
And space.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.249
- You're harshing my juju.
- We can wait.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.408
I'm sure you can.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.723
But that's not what I asked.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.281
Hey. Hey, you know,
why don't we just come back later.

10:40.440 --> 10:45.082
I'm hungry anyway.
I'll let you pick who we eat.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.849
<i>I really want to go out</i>

11:05.840 --> 11:07.763
<i>I really want to go outside</i>

11:07.920 --> 11:10.400
Hey-Okay, got it.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.170
I have an identification spell...

11:12.320 --> 11:15.767
that might be able to tell me
what magic affected the necklace.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.127
It's gonna take a while,
so tell me if anyone's coming, okay?

11:21.440 --> 11:24.649
So you're not, like,
switching Salvatores, are you?

11:24.800 --> 11:25.926
- What?
- Caroline.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.442
Stay focused. As your friend,
who worries for you daily...

11:29.600 --> 11:33.491
- ...what is the deal with you and Damon?
- There is no deal.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.768
He's been just as focused
on finding Stefan.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.440
That doesn't make him
any less Damon.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.685
If my own father, who I love dearly,
can't change me...

11:42.840 --> 11:45.002
no one's changing Damon,
not even you.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.322
Why are we even talking about this?

11:47.480 --> 11:49.244
Hey. guys.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.406
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.685
It has its own magic.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.330
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.326
Founder's parties are just an excuse
for the Council to gather in back rooms...

12:20.480 --> 12:21.891
and plot against vampires.

12:22.520 --> 12:27.048
Hey, uh, I think you need to
take a beat with Elena.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.242
- Excuse me?
- Whatever you two have going on...

12:31.400 --> 12:34.449
- ...I think it's a bad idea.
- I don't think it's your problem.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.605
It is my problem. I'm supposed to look
after her, and this is me doing that.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.369
What do you think I'm doing?

12:41.800 --> 12:45.361
What I think is you need to take a beat.

12:48.360 --> 12:53.685
Damon, sorry, the mayor just called
for the Council meeting.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.928
My girl's dead. I'm bored.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.885
You weren't kidding
about being hungry.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.406
- It's been a long day.
- Try being related to her.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.207
You're being mean. Why are you
being mean? You used to love me.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.721
It's been 90 years, Rebekah,
give him a minute.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.087
- Why are you taking his side?
- Because, sister...

13:24.280 --> 13:27.124
I feel pity for any man
who doesn't give you what you want.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.727
Stop making me out to be a brat.
I'm not a brat.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.884
A thousand years of life experience
says otherwise.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.721
Ha, ha. You're no picnic, either.
I've only spent one summer with you...

13:36.880 --> 13:39.451
and I feel like I want
to blow my head off.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.889
Fantastic.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.164
I need to go.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.925
- Where's he going?
- To write a name on a wall.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.445
It's a long story.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.884
Anna?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.851
Where are you?
We don't have much time.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.923
We've got all the time in the world.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.807
I'm sorry about before.
I just got, um, distracted.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.966
It's fine. I get it.
Why haven't you told her?

14:22.760 --> 14:25.889
- She's been gone all summer.
- Yeah, I know that.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.327
Now, why haven't you told her really?

14:29.120 --> 14:32.647
You know, I don't even understand
how any of this is possible.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.326
Well, it's kind of a push and pull.

14:35.480 --> 14:39.280
I'm pushing from the other side,
trying to contact you...

14:39.480 --> 14:43.166
and sometimes, like just now,
if you pull...

14:43.360 --> 14:48.685
- "The other side"? Is that what it's called?
- That's what I call it.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.968
I'm all by myself here.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.005
It's like I'm part of your world,
only no one can see me.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.521
I'm just on the other side.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.250
Wait a minute. What about Vicki?

14:58.440 --> 15:01.523
Whenever you say you see her,
I feel something.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.480
A darkness. When I try to tell you not
to let her in, something crazy happens.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.642
Like she's trying to push me out.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.650
Like the windows breaking.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.687
Just be careful. Try not to let her in.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.047
She can't get through
if you're not open to it.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.171
You don't understand how amazing it is
to finally be able to talk to you.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.530
I'm all by myself here.
I don't have anyone.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.850
I'm sorry.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.681
I know you can't feel anything.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.600
Do it again.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.888
There you are.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.969
- Thought you were resting.
- Well, now we both have a secret.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.804
What did you see?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.327
It's what I heard that's interesting.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.089
You know, the girls with the necklace,
they were talking about you.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.084
Yet you didn't tell Klaus.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.965
Why?

16:25.400 --> 16:29.246
I wouldn't help that hybrid
half-breed with anything.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.405
The necklace is a talisman
from the Original Witch herself.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.243
- I want it.
- Well, I'm sorry, I can't help you.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.607
Don't be difficult.

16:40.920 --> 16:45.926
I'd hate to have to tell Klaus
what a liar his sidekick is.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.286
Guess I gotta get it out of you
the hard way, huh?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.130
Argh!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.767
What is this? Why can't I move?

17:09.960 --> 17:13.760
Relax. It's just a little paralysis spell.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.046
Nothing major.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.288
Argh! Unh!

17:17.440 --> 17:18.441
Argh!

17:19.160 --> 17:21.970
Gotta get that information
out of your pretty little head.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.442
You know, witches nowadays,
they're into that New Age stuff.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.726
Ugh!

17:30.600 --> 17:32.489
But I'm a little more
old-school voodoo.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.206
Ah. To stop that pesky healing.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.084
I won't tell you anything.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.169
You don't have to.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.689
Feel that? That's your essence.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.605
Your spirit.
It lets me make a connection.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.005
Herbs help too.

18:08.240 --> 18:12.006
Diviner's sage. Witch hazel.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.086
But my personal favorite...

18:18.000 --> 18:19.126
vervain.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.365
There have been no incidents
of question since spring.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.846
It's been quiet.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.962
Anyone else have anything to add
to the minutes? Damon?

18:36.120 --> 18:40.603
Oh, no, I think the sheriff covered it,
Mayor Lockwood.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.882
Looks like we've made it
through the worst.

18:43.040 --> 18:47.011
Well, I have nothing new to add,
so thank you all for coming.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.529
Good to see you.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.842
Carol.
- Damon.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.891
I have a question.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.891
Bill.

19:00.720 --> 19:06.170
Do you three think that everybody on
the Council is clueless or just stupid?

19:09.080 --> 19:12.801
Hey, tell me if you see anything
in these grimoires that involves...

19:13.000 --> 19:16.322
precious metals or a symbol
that resembles a necklace.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.165
Can't you just ask the dead witches
you were channeling?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.322
I don't have access to them anymore.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.165
- Since when?
- Since I brought you back to life.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.605
I messed with the balance of nature,
and there were consequences.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.606
Hey, I'm sorry,
I know I should have told you.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.082
I told Elena when it happened.
I didn't want you to feel weird about it.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.843
Hey, no, no. Look, you don't
have to apologize for anything.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.606
You didn't do anything wrong.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.930
Elena said you've been
having a hard time since then.

19:50.800 --> 19:55.124
No, I'm fine, you know'?
Just been a little out of it lately.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.804
So should I concentrate
on the older books, or...?

19:58.960 --> 20:01.088
- I mean, how old is this necklace?
- Old.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.601
Yeah.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.888
Jeremy. The darkness...

20:12.040 --> 20:13.485
it's here.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.846
Jeremy!

20:26.240 --> 20:27.366
Are you okay?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.611
- What the hell just happened?
- I have no idea.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.929
I'm impressed.
You've got discipline, Stefan.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.162
It's not gonna
do you much good, but...

20:40.800 --> 20:42.564
Just let go, honey.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.003
- There we go. There we go.
- Ah!

20:48.920 --> 20:50.968
<i>There's the girl with the necklace.
- Ah!</i>

20:51.520 --> 20:53.249
You love her.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.683
- You'd do anything for her, and you have.
- Argh! Ugh!

20:59.760 --> 21:02.923
- A lot of darkness. A lot of guilt.
- Ugh!

21:03.080 --> 21:06.641
All to keep her away from Klaus.
Why would he be interested in one girl?

21:06.800 --> 21:09.167
Don't do this. Don't do this.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.207
She's the doppelganger.

21:17.360 --> 21:22.890
She's supposed to be dead, and that's
why Klaus can't make hybrids, isn't it?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.850
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Well, this is creepy.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.125
Maybe you do need my help after all.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.001
Did Stefan tell you
where he got the necklace?

21:40.160 --> 21:43.050
No, and I never asked.
Hopefully Bonnie will figure it out.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.363
- Please tell me it's time to go.
- Beyond. Where's Damon?

21:46.520 --> 21:49.569
Probably off somewhere
doing bad things to good people.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.371
Consider me the honesty police.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.806
What is it?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.048
- What's the matter?
- It's my dad.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.562
- Why would he show up here?
- I don't know.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.246
- But I can't...
- I get it.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.568
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.206
Okay, what was that all about?

22:10.360 --> 22:13.091
Speaking of doing bad things
to good people...

22:18.440 --> 22:20.442
Wait, Houston, we have a problem.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.887
- Where have you been?
- Managing Bill Forbes.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.202
- He's impervious to compulsion.
- How?

22:25.400 --> 22:29.405
I have no idea. But he threatened to out
me. Don't get me started on the irony.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.245
What'd you do? How do you know
compulsion doesn't work?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.926
That's not the most important piece
of information.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.088
- What does he want?
- To control the Council.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.288
- Says it's been compromised.
- It has.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.966
- Wants to put vervain in the water.
- Not a bad idea.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.122
It will help you
keep yourself in control...

22:44.280 --> 22:46.123
- ...now that Stefan's not here to...
- To what?

22:46.280 --> 22:48.442
To keep me in check?
Make me behave?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.280
- Should have killed him.
- He's Caroline's dad, Damon.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.767
She'll have one more parent
than we do.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.410
Oh, come on, Damon.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.649
You're repeatedly killing my
buzz today, Ric. Step aside.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.245
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.525
Your temporary funeral.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.200
Damon, no!

23:08.320 --> 23:10.641
What is wrong with you?

23:20.880 --> 23:23.565
I've been thinking about
your diabolical plan.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.131
Oh, do tell.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.807
You must know that Klaus
is too paranoid to ever fully trust you.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.209
But the sister, she loves you
like it was yesterday.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.328
She's the easier mark.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.121
But you can't just pretend to care,
because Klaus will know better.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.726
So you do the opposite,
you bond with him.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.851
Make her feel left out.
That'll only make her want you more.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.643
Oh, so you mean I'm taking a page
out of the Katherine Pierce playbook.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.406
The only question is why, Stefan?

23:53.560 --> 23:56.564
I mean, I get it. You wanna
keep Klaus away from Mystic Falls...

23:56.720 --> 23:59.610
but what else do you expect
to get from it?

24:00.520 --> 24:01.851
You know what's funny?

24:02.040 --> 24:05.931
You keep talking to me like I trust you
enough to tell you anything.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.208
Oh, come on, Stefan.
We're beyond that.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.883
I saved you from Hilda
the high-voodoo priestess.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.645
Okay.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.088
I knew them, back in the '20s.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.049
They were running from someone,
someone who scared them.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.921
A hunter.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.608
I heard stories
about him centuries ago.

24:28.760 --> 24:33.288
Don't you wanna know why
an Original vampire who can't be killed...

24:33.440 --> 24:35.602
is afraid of a vampire hunter?

24:36.360 --> 24:39.330
If you're planning on making a move
against Klaus...

24:39.480 --> 24:41.209
I want in.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.089
That's good.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.641
It's good to want things, Katherine.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.211
- Stefan.
- Katherine.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.205
I'm in this alone.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.807
If you're looking
for a diabolical partner in crime...

24:54.960 --> 24:57.850
I suggest you look elsewhere.

25:11.480 --> 25:15.087
- How was football practice?
- What are you doing here?

25:15.800 --> 25:19.327
Hiding out from my dad. He's here.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.608
Are you okay?

25:25.640 --> 25:28.530
- Do you want me to kick his ass?
- Heh, heh, heh.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.728
Yes. No.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.890
I bought him the shirt he's wearing.
It is really expensive.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.485
Hm.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.687
And through everything...

25:41.440 --> 25:43.761
he's still my dad.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.850
You know?

25:52.640 --> 25:54.210
- God, you reek.
- What?

25:54.400 --> 25:57.529
- Yeah, it's bad.
- This? This is sexy.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.648
- No. It's really bad.
- No.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.364
- Hang on. My phone.
- God, come on.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.844
I'm only answering in case
it's a friend emergency.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.162
It's an emergency.

26:40.280 --> 26:44.490
Whoa. Is that Scotch?
I figured you for an abstainer.

26:44.680 --> 26:49.481
Everything in moderation.
Keeps the mind clear from influence.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.251
- Like vampire compulsion?
- I tried to tell you...

26:52.400 --> 26:55.085
Yeah, yeah. Powerful tool. Got it.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.562
I'm impressed.
Can't say I've ever seen that before.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.161
It takes a certain human focus.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.847
It's a skill that I've been honing
for decades.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.322
Plus, your technique is a little lazy.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.089
Duly noted.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.203
I'm curious.
Why not just expose us to the Council?

27:15.400 --> 27:19.485
You think I'm the bad guy, but I'd never
expose my daughter to those morons.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.928
It's a pretty risky move taking me on,
don't you think?

27:23.880 --> 27:27.726
I knew what I was risking when I didn't
leave town. But I figured...

27:28.080 --> 27:31.482
you're not self-destructive enough
to kill the sheriff's ex-husband.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.164
Makes you the third person
to underestimate me today.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.840
Hoo.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.204
You know, with all this
behavioral modification going on...

27:51.360 --> 27:55.046
I almost forgot how good
blood tastes when it's fresh.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.090
What, are you gonna kill everybody
who discovers your secret?

27:58.240 --> 28:01.005
No, I'm not gonna kill you, Bill.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.921
I'm just gonna find pleasure
in perfect little moments like this.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.360
Argh!

28:09.920 --> 28:11.126
Unh!

28:14.720 --> 28:16.563
- Daddy. You okay?
- I'll be fine.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.045
Here. It'll heal you.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.884
- I said I'm okay.
- Grow up.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.044
Let me teach this ass-wheel
a life lesson.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.770
- Just get out of here.
- Or what?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.248
Ugh! Unh!

28:34.800 --> 28:37.280
I'm stronger than you, little girl.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.164
I'm angrier. Ugh!

28:44.960 --> 28:46.644
Bummer.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.770
- I love a good girl-fight.
- You can't do this anymore, Damon.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.288
- Not in this town, not around me.
- Why not?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.010
Nothing I haven't done before.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.164
Why is it so important for everyone
to keep me in check?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.766
I don't want you to be
what other people think.

29:01.920 --> 29:06.562
What, a monster? Sorry to disappoint,
but last I checked, I was still a vampire.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.489
I wish you didn't have to act like one!

29:08.680 --> 29:11.809
I'm not Stefan. How about you stop
trying to turn me into him.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.763
Hey, Jeremy.
There's ashes everywhere.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.321
- I'll go grab the vacuum.
- No, I got it.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.442
Are you okay?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.451
- Don't.
- What?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.048
Bonnie's here, okay? You gotta stop.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.971
I was just trying to warn you.
I felt something bad.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.770
Dangerous.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.763
You just can't pop up
every time she and I are together.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.727
It's a two-way street, Jeremy.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.531
I only pop up
when you're thinking about me.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.726
That's why you haven't told her,
isn't it?

30:04.800 --> 30:07.406
You don't want her to know
you still care.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.888
I can't do this right now.
I can't, this is just too much.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.890
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
- Goodbye, Anna.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.403
Don't. Jeremy, please.
Don't shut me out.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.924
What's wrong?

30:32.760 --> 30:35.604
You asked me before if something
was wrong, and I said no.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.564
Yeah?

30:45.440 --> 30:47.442
That was a lie.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.401
I was lying to you.

30:51.560 --> 30:56.930
- When you brought me back to life...
- Say you can you hear me, Jeremy.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.602
- Please!
- ...something happened.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.764
I am all alone.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.609
You're back.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.970
Finally.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.881
Nik went to check on the witch.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.765
Dreary, isn't it?

31:34.280 --> 31:36.567
- Family cargo.
- Hm.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.651
Why don't you un-dagger them?

31:39.800 --> 31:41.802
Because he would hunt me down
and kill me.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.924
He's a vindictive little bastard,
my brother.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.402
But you still care about him. Why?

31:48.560 --> 31:53.361
Well, I hated him for a long time.
It was exhausting.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.967
You know, when I met you two...

31:57.480 --> 31:59.881
you were both on the run.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.000
Also exhausting.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.491
- Who were you running from?
- What do you mean?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.688
Last night I saw you...

32:08.840 --> 32:10.842
there was a man looking for you.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.968
You both seemed afraid.

32:13.120 --> 32:17.921
I just... I wouldn't think Klaus
would be afraid of anybody.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.128
No one in this world is truly fearless,
Stefan. Not even Niklaus.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.601
Who was that man?

32:25.760 --> 32:28.047
I can't. Please.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.362
If Nik knew we were
talking about this, he...

32:30.520 --> 32:32.966
No, no, no. I'm sorry. Just...

32:33.120 --> 32:34.610
forget I asked.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.401
Okay?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.883
Nik told me about the girl you loved.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.881
The one that died.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.567
He also told me that you're only with
him because he saved your brother.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.490
That's true.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.480
I think he secretly
admires that about you.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.490
That you would sacrifice anything
for family.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.561
Don't tell him I told you that.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.167
Your secret is safe with me.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.527
Do you think you'll ever love anyone
like you loved that girl?

33:24.680 --> 33:26.603
One day, maybe.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.921
I can always tell when you're lying,
Stefan.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.851
What? I'm not...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.844
Don't bother. Your kiss
already gave you away.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.005
Gloria's gone, she has cleared out.
We need to find a new witch immediately.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.248
What's going on?

33:46.760 --> 33:49.411
Something's wrong.
He was asking about Mikael.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.129
- He's not with us, Nik. I can sense it.
- She's wrong.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.449
Klaus.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.091
Wake up.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.126
Wow.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.331
Took a bit longer than usual, huh?

34:39.719 --> 34:42.690
Might wanna get that ring checked.
Hope it's not going bad.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.810
- You killed me.
- You pissed me off.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.406
You killed me!

34:47.920 --> 34:50.525
Ric, no hard feelings.
I was on a bit of a tear.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.001
Everyone was trying to tell me
how to behave.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.367
Maybe they finally realized
you're a dick.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.250
<i>I'm not gonna say I told you so.</i>

34:58.440 --> 35:01.842
- Thank you.
- But I did tell you. $0...

35:02.000 --> 35:05.561
Okay, you and Damon were both right.
I was trying to change him.

35:05.720 --> 35:09.611
- But if he wants to be in my life...
- No, wait. I...

35:09.760 --> 35:12.081
It's been a long week,
so I'm gonna be blunt.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.244
It doesn't matter what he does.
Damon's gotten under your skin.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.845
That's not true.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.968
God, just admit it, Elena. Okay?

35:19.120 --> 35:22.727
You are attracted to him,
in all of his bad-brother glory.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.928
- No.
- No you're not attracted to him...

35:25.080 --> 35:27.606
- ...or no you won't admit it?
- I can't, Caroline.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.288
If I admit it...

35:32.400 --> 35:35.609
If I even let the thought in
for just a second...

35:36.400 --> 35:38.767
what does that say about me?

35:41.520 --> 35:45.366
It says you're human, Elena.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.920
- Do you want me to...?
- No. I got it.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.090
Hey.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.966
Hey.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.127
Don't worry. I'm gonna go back home
before somebody kills me.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.567
- How's your...?
- Oh, healed. See?

36:18.760 --> 36:20.364
Thank you...

36:20.880 --> 36:22.848
for coming to my rescue.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.289
You're welcome.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.322
Bye, Caroline.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.290
Daddy?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.009
I'm gonna be okay.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.368
You're a vampire, sweetheart.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.170
I don't think you'll ever be okay again.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.608
I understand
where you're coming from, but...

37:13.760 --> 37:17.651
The Gilbert family is a founding family.
They deserve a voice on the Council.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.121
I take care of them,
I should be that voice.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.601
- That's not the way it works.
- Oh, really?

37:22.800 --> 37:27.203
Then tell me how it does. The Council's
job is to protect the people of this town.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.842
Now, your daughter's a vampire
and your son's a werewolf.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.926
So who's looking after
the actual people?

37:34.720 --> 37:38.247
Some of them may be family or friends,
but they are still supernatural.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.171
They don't follow our rules.
They look after themselves.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.806
And that's what we need to do.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.243
I'll see you at the next meeting.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.482
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.642
I saw Jeremy.
He said you have my necklace.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.127
I haven't figured out
what's going on with it.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.886
I know, but I feel weird without it.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.089
- The whole Stefan of it all.
- Okay.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.929
Did Jeremy also tell you...

38:15.080 --> 38:19.244
that he's been seeing ghosts
of his dead girlfriends all summer?

38:19.440 --> 38:20.930
- What?
- Vicki and Anna.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.162
- He's been talking to them.
- You're kidding.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.840
I wish. It's because
I brought him back to life.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.322
Witches said
there would be consequences.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.642
I guess they were right.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.441
What am I supposed to...?

38:47.320 --> 38:49.607
I will accept written apologies only.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.970
Are you two lovebirds fighting already?

38:58.120 --> 38:59.770
Katherine.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.569
Wonderful. What do you want?

39:02.720 --> 39:06.202
I'm just a girl looking for
a partner in crime.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.049
Feel like hitting the road?
Getting the hell out of Dodge?

39:13.640 --> 39:15.529
You have impeccable timing.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.204
I was told I need to take a beat.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.888
Is that a yes? I'll drive.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.006
Why not?

39:27.160 --> 39:30.050
Walls are starting to close in on me
around here.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.085
- Where we going?
- Away from here.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.483
That's all I'm gonna give you
for right now. But believe me...

39:37.760 --> 39:39.524
it's good.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.606
Hm.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.847
Just give me a chance
to explain myself, okay?

40:07.000 --> 40:10.209
No need. I'm not mad. I'm just curious.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.489
Rebekah seems to think
you're holding on to something:

40:13.680 --> 40:15.125
A piece of your old life.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.602
The thing is, she's got flawless instincts.
Borderline supernatural.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.560
So I thought I would check it out.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.203
See for myself what it is
you've been hiding.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.884
Welcome back to Mystic Falls, Stefan.
