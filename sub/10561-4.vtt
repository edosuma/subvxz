01:03.363 --> 01:05.397
You ready?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.803
Let's go!

01:09.870 --> 01:11.670
Hands on your head!

01:11.737 --> 01:13.939
The key! Where's the key?!

01:14.007 --> 01:16.074
I don't have it.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.610
Let's get out of here.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.946
Don't move.

01:32.224 --> 01:34.892
- Please.
- Get out.

01:38.563 --> 01:42.333
I remember this blaze.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.335
How are you, old girl?

01:45.402 --> 01:47.337
Move off, you louse!

01:50.574 --> 01:53.643
For your missus?

01:53.711 --> 01:56.947
Go away, kid.

02:01.117 --> 02:03.385
I said move off!

02:03.453 --> 02:06.421
Hey, no need to get persnickety.

02:10.193 --> 02:13.896
- Police!
- Police! How did they know?!

02:13.964 --> 02:15.897
- Police!
- Leave the rest.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.802
Go, go, go!

02:24.306 --> 02:26.607
What in damnation?!

02:26.675 --> 02:29.210
Just take what we need.

02:29.278 --> 02:31.778
Let's go! Go! All right? Go!

02:43.091 --> 02:44.791
There was a drunk.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.926
He must have unhitched the horse.

02:46.994 --> 02:49.061
Why would he do that?

02:49.129 --> 02:50.796
Maybe he was a cop.

02:50.864 --> 02:52.865
How would a cop know where you'd be?

02:52.933 --> 02:54.367
I don't know.

02:54.434 --> 02:57.904
Maybe the boss has got loose lips.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.908
I'm the boss.

03:12.518 --> 03:14.953
Are you sure this is the
chap driving the carriage?

03:15.021 --> 03:18.056
Yes. His horse took off and
he ran away with another man.

03:18.124 --> 03:19.656
Thank you.

03:23.161 --> 03:27.331
No real loss. He wasn't
long for this world anyway.

03:27.399 --> 03:29.666
- I'm sorry?
- He was cirrhotic.

03:29.734 --> 03:32.669
- Oh, you knew him?
- I observed him.

03:32.737 --> 03:35.238
Detective Murdoch.

03:35.306 --> 03:36.839
We have a suspect, sir.

03:36.907 --> 03:38.975
He was in possession of
a mask and a bank box.

03:39.043 --> 03:41.377
Very good, Henry. Bring him
down to the stationhouse.

03:41.445 --> 03:44.814
- Yes, sir.
- No, that's not your man.

03:44.881 --> 03:47.050
Note his hands. The left hand is clean;

03:47.117 --> 03:49.018
the right hand is soiled and scratched.

03:49.086 --> 03:51.086
The bridge of his nose
and temples are reddened

03:51.154 --> 03:52.587
as if he wears glasses,

03:52.655 --> 03:54.789
but he's not wearing any now.

03:54.857 --> 03:57.625
Clearly he's a left-handed machinist.

03:57.693 --> 03:59.995
There's a machine shop just down on Durand,

04:00.063 --> 04:02.931
but the shift ended at 6am.

04:02.999 --> 04:06.435
The robbery occurred at 5:30am.

04:06.502 --> 04:09.403
So that is not your man.

04:09.471 --> 04:11.105
I'm sorry,

04:11.173 --> 04:13.407
who are you?

04:19.947 --> 04:22.616
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

04:26.888 --> 04:29.823
- Bloody hell. Where did he come from?
- Dr. Grace has acquired

04:29.890 --> 04:32.358
a new skeleton. She gave that one to me.

04:32.426 --> 04:36.429
No doubt a day of great joy and
celebration. So, any news on the robbery?

04:36.497 --> 04:40.199
By all accounts it was a
well-orchestrated heist.

04:40.267 --> 04:42.235
- Foiled by an anonymous tip.
- Yes,

04:42.302 --> 04:45.403
the call came from a front st.
exchange. We're looking into it now.

04:45.471 --> 04:47.405
They killed one of their own. Any leads?

04:47.473 --> 04:50.175
We have a suspect awaiting interview.

04:50.243 --> 04:52.978
Who's the bloke dressed as Sherlock Holmes?

04:53.046 --> 04:55.848
Well, sir, he claims to be Sherlock Holmes.

04:55.915 --> 05:00.685
A detective who is a man of
science. About time, I'd say.

05:00.753 --> 05:03.621
Scotland Yard could learn a thing or two.

05:03.689 --> 05:06.457
Detective, we have matters to discuss.

05:08.426 --> 05:10.361
Have a seat in the waiting area,

05:10.428 --> 05:12.897
and I will be with you shortly.

05:17.168 --> 05:20.704
When you were detained, you were in possession
of a bank safe deposit box and a mask...

05:20.772 --> 05:23.173
both items directly
related to a bank robbery.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.777
I found them. In the
laneway behind the shop.

05:26.844 --> 05:29.646
What is it you do?

05:29.714 --> 05:32.948
I'm a drill-press operator. I work
the night shift. I got off at six.

05:33.016 --> 05:36.285
Plenty of witnesses to that, sir.

05:36.352 --> 05:38.287
Do you ever wear glasses?

05:38.354 --> 05:41.623
At work, to preserve my eyes.

05:41.692 --> 05:45.327
Which hand do you use?

05:45.395 --> 05:49.597
My left. Is that important?

05:49.665 --> 05:52.100
- What is it?
- Sir, he knew everything

05:52.168 --> 05:54.368
- about our suspect.
- Who?

05:54.436 --> 05:57.138
The man who claims he's Sherlock Holmes.

05:57.206 --> 05:59.307
Do you think he could have been involved?

06:01.476 --> 06:05.245
- What's your name?
- Sherlock Holmes...
- Your real name!

06:05.313 --> 06:07.047
That is my real name.

06:07.115 --> 06:10.050
What were you doing at
the scene of the robbery?

06:10.118 --> 06:11.651
I deciphered the codes.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.855
- What codes?
- The coded messages, of course.

06:14.923 --> 06:16.857
Moriarty puts them in the newspaper.

06:16.925 --> 06:19.860
That's how he communicates
with his agents of evil.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.532
Well, he's a complete crackpot.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.667
I'll have Dr. Ogden provide an assessment.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.336
So, what now?

06:30.403 --> 06:33.339
Well, I think we can safely
assume that the routes and times

06:33.406 --> 06:36.175
of armoured carriage transfers
are not public knowledge.

06:36.243 --> 06:39.044
An inside job, then.

06:39.112 --> 06:42.313
I've been doing this for two years.
Until today it seemed like a good job.

06:42.381 --> 06:46.017
- Were you carrying anything unusual?
- No, sir.

06:46.085 --> 06:48.686
Um, paper money and bank boxes.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.123
This is the cargo list.

06:54.259 --> 06:57.561
- And who else gets a copy of this?
- Just me.

06:57.629 --> 07:00.264
The driver receives the protocol.

07:00.331 --> 07:03.167
The protocol lays out
the route and destination.

07:03.235 --> 07:06.336
- When did you receive this?
- Just prior to our departure.

07:06.404 --> 07:10.774
- It's all part of the security arrangement.
- And who sets the protocol?

07:10.841 --> 07:12.675
The bank manager.

07:12.743 --> 07:15.011
Our branch on Spadina is closing

07:15.079 --> 07:17.280
and all assets were being
transferred downtown.

07:17.347 --> 07:20.349
The content of the cargo, time of shipment,

07:20.417 --> 07:22.618
and routes are set the day before.

07:22.686 --> 07:25.220
- And who sets them?
- I do.

07:25.288 --> 07:27.355
And who else is privy to that information?

07:27.423 --> 07:29.892
No one.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.360
Then how did the thieves
know the carriage route?

07:32.428 --> 07:34.763
I don't know.

07:38.168 --> 07:41.102
Cause of death was a single gunshot
to the head at point-blank range.

07:41.170 --> 07:46.373
I extracted the bullet... .38 calibre.

07:46.441 --> 07:49.576
Hm. Dr. Grace, did the victim have

07:49.644 --> 07:51.645
cirrhosis of the liver, by chance?

07:51.713 --> 07:54.182
As a matter of fact he
did. How did you know that?

07:54.249 --> 07:57.350
A suspect speculated on it.

07:57.418 --> 08:00.153
Well, he must be a very observant fellow.

08:00.221 --> 08:02.956
That he is.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.225
Julia. Thank you for coming in.

08:05.293 --> 08:08.161
How could I not? A man
claiming to be Sherlock Holmes.

08:08.229 --> 08:10.063
He's in my office.

08:12.099 --> 08:13.966
Mr. Holmes, I'd like you to meet

08:14.034 --> 08:16.302
a colleague of mine. This is...

08:18.404 --> 08:19.939
Wonderful.

08:20.006 --> 08:23.943
George, have you seen the man
claiming to be Sherlock Holmes?

08:24.010 --> 08:27.046
Sir, he's right there in your... Oh.

08:27.113 --> 08:29.180
He was to remain in my office.

08:29.248 --> 08:31.316
That's very cheeky.

08:31.383 --> 08:34.485
I'm sorry, sir. I was distracted. I did
find some interesting information, though.

08:34.553 --> 08:38.289
Both our victim and one of the carriage
guards live in the same rooming house.

08:38.357 --> 08:40.624
Now, either that's a strange coincidence...

08:40.692 --> 08:43.094
Or they knew each other.

08:51.936 --> 08:56.039
Detective. I was wondering
when you'd finally get here.

08:56.107 --> 08:58.775
Moriarty has struck again.

09:06.052 --> 09:09.487
You've now been found at
the scene of two crimes.

09:09.555 --> 09:12.524
- How do you explain that?
- I've made myself clear.

09:12.591 --> 09:15.993
- I'm in pursuit of Moriarty.
- Bugger Moriarty.

09:16.062 --> 09:19.296
How did you come to find yourself
in the room of a dead bank guard?

09:19.364 --> 09:22.366
I found his address on
your constable's desk.

09:22.434 --> 09:24.701
Are you being deliberately obtuse?

09:24.769 --> 09:26.870
If you're asking why I was there,

09:26.938 --> 09:29.373
I should have thought that was obvious.

09:29.441 --> 09:32.709
It is my belief that the guard
was working with Moriarty.

09:32.777 --> 09:34.710
All right,

09:34.778 --> 09:37.613
and how did you come to that conclusion?

09:37.681 --> 09:40.249
Did you notice that the
guard sat for an hour

09:40.317 --> 09:43.586
with blood crusting on his face rather
than avail himself of a wash basin?

09:43.653 --> 09:45.854
I did think that was a bit odd.

09:45.922 --> 09:48.023
And no doubt you also observed that

09:48.092 --> 09:51.326
the two cuts were straight and
fine, suggesting that they were made

09:51.394 --> 09:53.761
with a razor blade.

09:53.829 --> 09:56.264
This razor blade.

09:58.934 --> 10:01.269
I found it in his pocket.

10:04.273 --> 10:06.740
What about the robbery itself?

10:06.808 --> 10:08.875
How did you know it was going to happen?

10:08.943 --> 10:11.345
- I deciphered the codes.
- Which codes?

10:11.413 --> 10:14.014
The codes I informed you of earlier!

10:21.590 --> 10:25.125
I thought Professor Moriarty was dead.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.659
As did I.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.162
Then what makes you think
he's behind these crimes?

10:29.230 --> 10:31.164
I recognized one of his henchmen.

10:31.232 --> 10:32.999
Recognized?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.335
I saw him at The Reichenbach Falls.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.902
Reichenbach Falls.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.672
Where you and Moriarty had
your final confrontation.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.008
Not as final as I'd hoped.

10:45.011 --> 10:48.213
And when did you see
this henchman in Toronto?

10:48.281 --> 10:51.850
Yesterday. I was travelling
on the Queen St. car,

10:51.917 --> 10:54.485
and by the time I disembarked, he was gone.

10:54.553 --> 10:58.523
But I found the paper he
was reading and recognized

10:58.590 --> 11:01.792
a section of the page was
missing. I purchased another copy,

11:01.860 --> 11:05.163
and on the missing page was a coded
message specifying a time and a place.

11:05.230 --> 11:08.899
Suspecting a robbery, I
set about to thwart it.

11:08.967 --> 11:12.469
- By disguising yourself and unhitching the horses.
- I informed the police,

11:12.537 --> 11:16.039
but they were even slower than I expected.

11:18.778 --> 11:22.014
Sirs, the dead guard had a sweetheart who
worked in Accounts at the Spadina branch.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.050
- He used to visit her.
- That's likely how

11:24.117 --> 11:26.552
- he found out about the cargo.
- What's curious is that

11:26.619 --> 11:29.688
almost all the money was left in the
getaway carriage. The only thing taken

11:29.756 --> 11:31.891
from the scene was two safe deposit boxes,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.559
one of which we retrieved.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.626
Maybe the thieves weren't after the money.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.929
They were after the contents
of the safe deposit boxes.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.497
Right. George, bring in
the bank manager. We need

11:39.565 --> 11:41.867
- to know what was inside of them.
- Sir.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.869
Oh, and George, if you
could please pick up a copy

11:43.936 --> 11:45.803
- of yesterday's Gazette.
- Will do.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.805
So, you're telling me

11:47.874 --> 11:50.507
you believe "Sherlock's"
story about the codes?

11:50.575 --> 11:53.510
Well, sir, a coded message in
a newspaper article would be

11:53.578 --> 11:56.513
an effective way to convey
information about routes, cargo...

11:56.581 --> 11:59.549
Murdoch, I'll leave you to it.

11:59.617 --> 12:02.119
I trust he hasn't managed
to give you the slip again.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.621
He's in the interview room.

12:16.267 --> 12:18.701
You don't look much like an alienist.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.536
What makes you think...

12:20.604 --> 12:22.871
You've been brought in to assess my sanity.

12:22.939 --> 12:25.540
Detective Murdoch, for all
his scientific pretence,

12:25.608 --> 12:28.210
is no more imaginative
than Inspector Lestrade.

12:37.253 --> 12:39.253
Why don't you tell me about yourself?

12:39.321 --> 12:42.290
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
I'm a consulting detective.

12:42.357 --> 12:45.526
Until five years ago, I
resided at 221B Baker St.

12:45.593 --> 12:49.997
With my friend Dr. Watson. Since then
I have become somewhat peripatetic.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.700
When were you born?

12:53.768 --> 12:55.969
The 6th of January, 1860.

12:56.037 --> 12:57.904
You don't look 40.

12:57.972 --> 13:00.873
A fact I attribute to a stringent diet.

13:00.942 --> 13:03.543
Tell me more.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.478
I don't wish to be a bore.

13:05.546 --> 13:07.213
It won't bore me.

13:07.281 --> 13:08.881
It bores me!

13:08.950 --> 13:12.418
Moriarty is out there, and I'm in here!

13:12.485 --> 13:14.853
Please, Doctor,

13:14.921 --> 13:19.524
make the detective see sense.
You're obviously very close to him.

13:21.995 --> 13:24.830
- Why makes you think that?
- When I called his competence

13:24.897 --> 13:26.864
into question, you stiffened.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.000
If he were just a colleague,
you might have defended him;

13:29.068 --> 13:31.202
instead you chose to remain silent,

13:31.270 --> 13:33.537
fearing your response
might betray your feelings.

13:37.042 --> 13:40.345
And with only that he was able to
deduce that I have feelings for you.

13:40.412 --> 13:42.679
Well, he's quite perceptive, isn't he?

13:42.746 --> 13:46.149
He's not psychotic,
though. His logic is clear.

13:46.217 --> 13:49.552
Julia, the man genuinely believes
that he's Sherlock Holmes.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.922
He's suffering from a delusion
of identity. It's not uncommon.

13:52.991 --> 13:55.758
There's a woman at the asylum
who believes she's the Queen.

13:55.826 --> 13:58.995
As long as their delusion is not
challenged, they're quite harmless.

13:59.062 --> 14:01.330
What are the chances of something like this

14:01.398 --> 14:04.033
springing fully formed in adulthood?

14:04.101 --> 14:06.469
This delusion is usually
a compensatory response

14:06.536 --> 14:08.837
to emotional trauma in childhood.

14:08.905 --> 14:11.340
He likely has some psychiatric history.

14:11.408 --> 14:13.309
I'll see what I can find.

14:13.377 --> 14:14.909
Thank you, Julia.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.151
Dr. Grace. What have you?

14:23.219 --> 14:26.153
The bank guard was killed by a bullet
wound to the heart... left ventricle.

14:26.154 --> 14:28.223
- Have you retrieved...
- Thirty-eight calibre,

14:28.290 --> 14:29.957
same as the first murder.

14:30.025 --> 14:32.792
Hm.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.961
Sirs!

14:35.030 --> 14:37.064
I think I've found the code.

14:37.132 --> 14:40.100
Have a look at the funeral
listings, third one down on the left.

14:40.168 --> 14:43.470
The time and location of the funeral
correspond to that of the robbery.

14:43.538 --> 14:47.573
The coded message is real. Our
Mr. Holmes was telling the truth.

14:47.641 --> 14:50.510
- Or he placed it there himself.
- For what purpose?

14:50.577 --> 14:52.545
I don't know, but I don't trust him.

14:52.612 --> 14:55.548
Gentlemen, I've found the
identity of your Sherlock.

14:55.615 --> 14:59.352
His name is David Kingsley. He
was a patient of Dr. Roberts.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.754
- He was institutionalized?
- For a number of years.

15:02.821 --> 15:05.924
- Does he have any family?
- He has an uncle.

15:11.197 --> 15:13.898
His father died when David was an infant,

15:13.966 --> 15:17.669
his mother when he was 12.
Care for the boy fell to me.

15:17.736 --> 15:20.438
That must have been traumatic for the boy.

15:20.505 --> 15:23.507
He, uh, he withdrew into a fantasy world.

15:23.575 --> 15:26.177
The obsessive reading was one thing,

15:26.244 --> 15:28.645
but when he started thinking
he was Sherlock Holmes,

15:28.713 --> 15:30.581
my wife couldn't cope.

15:30.648 --> 15:32.683
We had him committed.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.818
When was he released?

15:35.886 --> 15:37.320
Six months ago.

15:37.388 --> 15:40.690
The doctor said he was
cured; obviously he was wrong.

15:40.757 --> 15:42.692
Is he in trouble?

15:42.759 --> 15:46.496
We believe he may have been
involved in an armed robbery.

15:46.564 --> 15:50.732
- Oh, dear Lord. How?
- That's what we're attempting

15:50.800 --> 15:54.303
- to find out.
- May I see him?

16:09.818 --> 16:11.319
Hello, David.

16:11.386 --> 16:14.088
I'm sorry, you're mistaking
me for someone else.

16:14.156 --> 16:17.358
David, it's me, your Uncle Oscar...

16:17.426 --> 16:20.961
I have no uncle. Detective, you must
release me. Let me help you solve this case.

16:21.029 --> 16:23.263
David, please.

16:23.331 --> 16:25.999
My name's Sherlock Holmes!

16:28.902 --> 16:30.903
I'm sorry, Mr. Kingsley.

16:46.219 --> 16:48.220
That's it?

16:48.288 --> 16:51.157
Hardly worth knocking
off an armoured car for.

16:51.224 --> 16:53.325
Who owns this box?

16:53.393 --> 16:57.094
Let's see. It belongs
to a Mr. Joshua Grady,

16:57.163 --> 16:59.330
a provincial court judge, I believe.

16:59.398 --> 17:01.466
And who owns the missing box?

17:01.534 --> 17:05.270
It's owned by Mr. Edward
Hopkins on Eglinton Ave.

17:05.337 --> 17:08.105
Sir, I had a thought
about our Sherlock fellow.

17:08.174 --> 17:09.607
What's that, George?

17:09.675 --> 17:12.276
Well, quite by chance,
Mr. Arthur Conan Doyle is

17:12.343 --> 17:14.478
attending a conference in New York.

17:14.546 --> 17:17.214
Really? Have you informed
him of our little problem?

17:17.281 --> 17:18.882
I did. I thought, you know,

17:18.949 --> 17:21.285
if our man met his creator...

17:21.352 --> 17:23.819
That's an excellent idea, George.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.902
Whoever Edward Hopkins is,

17:39.969 --> 17:42.571
he doesn't live here anymore.

17:42.638 --> 17:45.139
Yes, but someone has been here.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.676
Probably youngsters, sir.
They're prone to this kind

17:47.743 --> 17:50.312
of thing at that age. I know I was.

17:50.379 --> 17:52.880
George, have a look at
the lathe and plaster...

17:52.948 --> 17:55.617
it's been pulled off at
the bottom of the walls.

17:57.886 --> 18:00.421
Someone was looking for something.

18:10.532 --> 18:13.634
Sir, some of this mail goes back 10 years.

18:13.702 --> 18:16.202
Yes, most of it's been opened.

18:18.205 --> 18:20.707
Look at this postmark. It's quite recent.

18:22.743 --> 18:25.278
Right, let's round up all of this mail,

18:25.346 --> 18:28.514
- and see if we can find out what's going on here.
- Yes, sir.

18:34.554 --> 18:36.488
Sir, you're releasing him?

18:36.556 --> 18:38.657
We've had him for 24
hours. We can't hold him

18:38.725 --> 18:40.992
- unless we charge him.
- Detective.

18:41.060 --> 18:45.264
Professor Moriarty has left
us another coded message.

18:45.331 --> 18:48.932
According to this, he's meeting
his men at 398 Simcoe St.,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.168
- nine o'clock.
- I don't know about you,

18:51.236 --> 18:53.571
Detective, but this is one
meeting I plan to attend.

18:58.143 --> 19:00.077
They're late.

19:00.145 --> 19:03.413
Perhaps we deciphered the code incorrectly.

19:03.481 --> 19:04.914
No.

19:04.982 --> 19:08.585
We're at the right place at the right time.

19:08.653 --> 19:10.687
Unless...

19:10.755 --> 19:13.856
- Detective, we must leave immediately.
- Why?

19:13.924 --> 19:18.094
The coded messages were meant for
me. He knows I'm getting too close.

19:18.162 --> 19:21.664
What? 

19:21.731 --> 19:23.198
Mr. Holmes!

19:33.586 --> 19:36.455
- Is that cocaine?
- You'll feel some localized numbing.

19:36.522 --> 19:39.590
It's been a while since I've had cocaine.

19:42.261 --> 19:44.528
Ah!

19:44.596 --> 19:46.197
I was a fool, Detective,

19:46.265 --> 19:50.568
to have underestimated
Moriarty like that. It would...

19:50.636 --> 19:52.603
it would have been obvious
to him that I had cracked

19:52.671 --> 19:54.906
his code. How else could
I have foiled his robbery?

20:00.044 --> 20:02.146
Thirty-eight calibre.

20:02.213 --> 20:05.549
- The same weapon was used in all three shootings.
- Of course it was.

20:05.617 --> 20:08.552
It was Moriarty's gun.

20:08.620 --> 20:12.374
You wouldn't by chance have a little
more of that cocaine, would you?

20:13.946 --> 20:16.859
- Bollocks. There is no Moriarty.
- Of course not.

20:16.927 --> 20:20.163
But the same gun that was used to
shoot the getaway carriage driver

20:20.230 --> 20:23.266
and the bank guard was also
used to shoot Mr. Kingsley.

20:23.334 --> 20:26.135
- I'm still convinced that he's trying to pull a fast one.
- I hardly think he would

20:26.203 --> 20:28.036
orchestrate his own shooting.

20:28.104 --> 20:31.307
Maybe he was once a part of this gang.

20:31.374 --> 20:34.876
Maybe there was bad blood.
That would explain his presence

20:34.944 --> 20:37.212
at the crime scene and how
he could decipher their code.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.215
He knows what they've
stolen and he wants it.

20:40.283 --> 20:41.717
And he's going to get it

20:41.785 --> 20:44.119
by dressing up as Sherlock Holmes?

20:44.187 --> 20:47.755
Oh, I don't know, Murdoch, but until we
figure it out, I want him back in custody.

20:47.824 --> 20:51.893
Actually, sir, he may be
more valuable working with us.

20:51.961 --> 20:56.231
I have to admit he's picking up
on things that I've overlooked.

20:56.299 --> 20:59.667
You know, you won't find
Moriarty in the mail.

20:59.735 --> 21:02.769
I'm not looking for Moriarty right now.

21:05.874 --> 21:08.475
This mail goes back 10 years.

21:08.543 --> 21:10.077
Yes.

21:12.047 --> 21:14.381
Was the house ransacked?

21:16.350 --> 21:18.117
How did you know?

21:18.185 --> 21:20.286
It's elementary, Constable Crabtree.

21:20.354 --> 21:23.723
He hasn't lived in the house for 10
years, yet the property taxes were paid

21:23.790 --> 21:25.725
in full and someone has
been opening his mail,

21:25.792 --> 21:27.961
and that someone is looking for something.

21:28.028 --> 21:29.462
But what?

21:29.529 --> 21:32.064
Match the discarded mail to the envelopes.

21:32.131 --> 21:35.600
Whatever's missing contained
something of interest to the killer.

21:37.603 --> 21:39.938
- Sir.
- What have you, George?

21:40.006 --> 21:42.474
This was the last piece of
mail Edward Hopkins received.

21:42.541 --> 21:45.410
Whoever's opening his mail
kept the contents of this one.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.746
Bank of Toronto.

21:47.813 --> 21:48.818
Yes, I've asked the manager to come down.

21:48.819 --> 21:50.479
Perhaps he can shed some
light on its contents.

21:50.682 --> 21:52.316
Very good idea, George.

21:52.384 --> 21:54.986
Actually, sir, it was Mr. Holmes' idea.

21:57.689 --> 21:59.723
Of course it was.

22:06.097 --> 22:08.365
Thank you for coming in.

22:08.432 --> 22:11.634
Moriarty! Congratulations, Detective.

22:11.702 --> 22:14.004
You've just captured the Napoleon of crime.

22:14.071 --> 22:17.173
- I'm just a bank manager.
- Of course it was your ruse.

22:17.241 --> 22:19.542
What were you after? Was
it the Star of Tarsus?

22:19.610 --> 22:21.176
The Star of Tarsus?

22:21.244 --> 22:23.279
- That's it. Lock him up!
- How did you survive

22:23.346 --> 22:26.215
the Reichenbach Falls? I
saw you go over the edge!

22:31.889 --> 22:34.356
A letter was sent to all bank customers

22:34.425 --> 22:36.658
letting them know their
accounts were being transferred.

22:36.726 --> 22:39.294
- Along with a list of assets?
- Of course.

22:39.361 --> 22:41.396
And what were Mr. Hopkins assets?

22:41.464 --> 22:46.301
Um, a savings account
in the amount of $479.

22:46.368 --> 22:49.037
And, of course, the safe deposit box.

22:49.104 --> 22:52.873
When was the safe deposit box rented?

22:52.941 --> 22:55.676
Um, July 7, 1890.

22:55.744 --> 22:58.178
And the last activity on that account?

23:01.215 --> 23:04.852
July 7, 1890.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.154
I can see leaving a house behind,

23:07.221 --> 23:09.823
even a safe deposit box,
but money in the bank?

23:09.890 --> 23:13.426
Sirs, Mr. Holmes has deduced
that Mr. Hopkins was murdered.

23:13.494 --> 23:16.128
- Deduced, has he?
- Yes, sir.

23:16.196 --> 23:18.565
When one eliminates the
impossible, then what remains...

23:18.632 --> 23:21.501
The problem with deductive
reasoning, George, is that

23:21.569 --> 23:24.403
one must first conceive
of every possibility.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.772
Now, Mr. Hopkins may
be dead, but he may also

23:26.840 --> 23:31.009
be unable to retrieve his money.
So before we deduce that he's dead,

23:31.077 --> 23:33.679
perhaps we should check
to see if he's in prison.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.849
Fair enough. On another note,

23:36.916 --> 23:40.352
I think I know why Mr. Holmes
thought the bank manager was Moriarty.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.888
This is Moriarty. Bloody hell.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.790
Looks just like him.

23:45.858 --> 23:50.094
Poor bugger. Perhaps he is just a crackpot.

23:50.161 --> 23:52.096
I was wrong, Detective.

23:52.163 --> 23:55.132
That man was not Moriarty.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.635
Moriarty's eyes burn with intelligence.

23:58.703 --> 24:02.739
The man I locked eyes with
back there was not him.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.079
Is this Moriarty?

24:10.147 --> 24:12.315
My god.

24:12.383 --> 24:15.050
Whoever drew this...

24:15.118 --> 24:17.352
has captured him perfectly.

24:20.757 --> 24:22.725
He's still out there, Detective.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.927
We must bring him down.

24:30.733 --> 24:32.433
Sir, no prison

24:32.501 --> 24:35.269
in Ontario currently has an
Edward Hopkins serving time.

24:35.337 --> 24:38.540
There was, however, an inmate by
that name who served about six months

24:38.607 --> 24:41.475
- in the Central Prison back in 1885.
- What was his crime?

24:41.544 --> 24:44.878
- Robbery.
- Right, George, find out who else was in Central Prison

24:44.946 --> 24:47.681
- at the same time as Mr. Hopkins.
- Good thinking, Detective.

24:47.749 --> 24:50.417
When one is in jail, one's
associates are the type

24:50.484 --> 24:53.420
likely to rob an armoured carriage.

24:53.487 --> 24:55.121
That's not him.

24:55.189 --> 24:59.893
Oh, we won't find Moriarty
this way, Crabtree!

24:59.961 --> 25:02.995
He's far too clever to be caught
using conventional tactics.

25:03.063 --> 25:06.599
Detective Murdoch is anything
but a conventional sleuth.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.668
You know, I've read all of
your stories, and I believe

25:08.735 --> 25:11.871
- he is your equal in every regard.
- My stories?

25:11.939 --> 25:14.774
Oh! That Watson.

25:14.841 --> 25:19.010
Always scribbling down our little
adventures. I do miss him sometimes.

25:19.078 --> 25:21.079
- Mm.
- That's him!

25:21.146 --> 25:24.482
- That's the man I saw.
- Moriarty?

25:24.550 --> 25:27.786
No, his henchman.

25:27.853 --> 25:30.822
His name is Sebastian Moran. He's an expert

25:30.890 --> 25:33.057
on using nitroglycerin to blow open safes.

25:33.124 --> 25:34.792
Or armoured carriages.

25:34.859 --> 25:37.661
Do we have a last-known address?

25:37.729 --> 25:39.730
There are two that we know of.

25:39.798 --> 25:41.699
Right. Crabtree and I will
go to Shuter St.

25:42.145 --> 25:45.102
You take Sherlock here and go to Spadina.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.071
And remember, this fellow's dangerous,

25:47.138 --> 25:50.006
so stop by the armoury on your way out.

26:08.357 --> 26:10.458
This cigar was stubbed recently.

26:10.526 --> 26:12.560
Very good, Detective.

26:20.369 --> 26:22.569
Must have left by the fire escape.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.073
Detective.

26:31.579 --> 26:33.180
"Aurora."

26:35.784 --> 26:38.652
It appears you were mistaken
about the fire escape, Detective.

26:38.719 --> 26:41.955
So, Moran, we meet again.

26:42.023 --> 26:44.557
Do you remember me?

26:48.029 --> 26:50.730
- Don't! Don't!
- I won't.

26:50.798 --> 26:52.365
Not yet.

26:52.432 --> 26:54.533
But very soon you'll lose consciousness

26:54.600 --> 26:57.402
and my friend here will have
to support your entire weight.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.204
Then I'll shoot.

27:07.947 --> 27:09.446
Give me that!

27:13.318 --> 27:16.020
- What does it mean?
- Perhaps it's a reference

27:16.088 --> 27:18.956
to the town of Aurora, north
of the city, along Yonge St.

27:19.024 --> 27:21.592
You know, in one of my
cases, "The Sign of the Four",

27:21.660 --> 27:25.562
a treasure was being conveyed
on a steamship called the Aurora.

27:25.629 --> 27:28.531
- This isn't about "The Sign of the Four".
- Well, no. These circumstances

27:28.599 --> 27:31.868
- recall "The Case of the Vanished Star".
- I don't remember that one.

27:31.936 --> 27:34.137
It was one of my most troubling cases.

27:34.205 --> 27:37.540
A valuable diamond called the Star
of Tarsus was stolen by Moriarty

27:37.608 --> 27:39.542
and one of his henchmen, but they...

27:39.610 --> 27:41.643
This isn't about any work of fiction!

27:41.712 --> 27:44.446
Real men are dead! And I
don't want to hear any more

27:44.514 --> 27:46.716
Sherlock-bloody-Holmes stories!

27:46.783 --> 27:50.920
Sir, Arthur Conan Doyle is here.

27:50.987 --> 27:52.822
Ah.

27:52.889 --> 27:55.455
Mr. Doyle! Arthur!

27:55.706 --> 27:59.460
- Pleasure to see you again.
- Inspector. Detective Murdoch.

27:59.528 --> 28:01.996
Mr. Doyle. Thank you for
coming on such short notice.

28:02.064 --> 28:04.498
Oh, how could I possibly
resist? It's not often

28:04.566 --> 28:07.801
that a writer gets to
meet his own creation.

28:07.869 --> 28:12.005
Arthur Conan Doyle, meet Sherlock Holmes.

28:14.075 --> 28:16.777
What you're suggesting,

28:16.845 --> 28:18.946
after I strip away the condescension,

28:19.013 --> 28:22.749
- is that I don't exist.
- You exist as a man, sir,

28:22.816 --> 28:27.587
but Sherlock Holmes is an
artistic invention. I created him.

28:27.655 --> 28:29.322
Um, look.

28:29.390 --> 28:32.759
This book was written
by Arthur Conan Doyle,

28:32.826 --> 28:35.694
yes? I am Arthur Conan Doyle.

28:35.762 --> 28:37.763
I'm familiar with these scribblings.

28:37.830 --> 28:41.166
I always assumed you were a
pseudonym for my dear friend

28:41.234 --> 28:45.337
Dr. Watson. It appears you
have put your name on his work.

28:45.405 --> 28:47.839
Given that you seem to
have earned your reputation

28:47.907 --> 28:51.009
on the basis of my adventures,
I submit to you, Mr. Doyle,

28:51.077 --> 28:53.010
that I created you.

28:53.078 --> 28:56.281
Alright then, um... Mr. Holmes,

28:56.348 --> 28:59.250
I suppose you're familiar with the story

28:59.318 --> 29:01.619
- "The Final Problem"?
- I am.

29:01.687 --> 29:04.855
Well, you died in that story, did you not?

29:04.923 --> 29:06.891
No. I shamefully led
Watson to that conclusion.

29:06.958 --> 29:09.025
Moriarty's agents were
determined to kill me.

29:09.093 --> 29:11.328
I had to make them
think I was already dead.

29:11.396 --> 29:14.765
There were two sets of footprints leading

29:14.832 --> 29:18.034
to the edge of the falls;
there were none coming back.

29:18.102 --> 29:20.604
- How did you survive?
- I retraced

29:20.672 --> 29:23.872
my own footsteps backwards to where I
could scale the cliff face and escape.

29:23.940 --> 29:27.209
Actually, that's not bad.

29:27.277 --> 29:29.612
What did you do after that?

29:29.680 --> 29:32.948
I set out to see the world.
I met the Dali Lama in Tibet,

29:33.016 --> 29:36.018
Caliphate in Sudan. Eventually I
came here and caught sight of Moran.

29:36.085 --> 29:38.375
- Moran?
- Sebastian Moran, one of...

29:38.376 --> 29:39.376
One of Moriarty's henchmen.

29:40.356 --> 29:43.525
Or do you not know his name?
Gentlemen, this conversation is

29:43.592 --> 29:46.127
bringing us no closer to Moriarty.

29:49.064 --> 29:52.033
Sebastian Moran. Rather
like the sound of that.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.635
Oh, no, no, no, he's insane.

29:53.703 --> 29:55.436
He's insane. Floridly so.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.438
But he has some damn good ideas.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.341
Mr. Doyle, what can you tell us

30:00.408 --> 30:02.843
about "The Case of the Vanished Star"?

30:02.910 --> 30:05.579
- The what?
- It's one of your stories.

30:05.647 --> 30:07.648
Yes, about the diamond...

30:07.716 --> 30:10.617
the Star of Tarsus. It features
Moriarty, his henchman...

30:10.685 --> 30:15.788
Detective, I have never written a story
called "The Case of the Vanished Star".

30:15.856 --> 30:17.790
It was 10 years ago.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.326
I'd just solved "The
Case of the Sign of Four"

30:20.394 --> 30:23.128
and was about to conduct
chemical experiments with gypsum

30:23.196 --> 30:25.130
when a young lad appeared at my door.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.899
In Toronto?

30:26.967 --> 30:28.867
No, London. Baker St.

30:28.934 --> 30:31.202
I only came to Canada
after Reichenbach Falls.

30:31.270 --> 30:34.072
- We've been over this.
- Yes, carry on.

30:34.139 --> 30:36.140
He was about 13,

30:36.208 --> 30:38.710
although the sorrow in his
eyes made him look older.

30:38.778 --> 30:40.311
I knew from his countenance...

30:40.380 --> 30:43.114
I don't care about his bloody countenance.

30:43.182 --> 30:46.116
Get to the facts.

30:46.184 --> 30:49.453
What did the boy want you to do?

30:49.521 --> 30:52.823
Solve the murder of his father
and retrieve the Star of Tarsus.

30:52.891 --> 30:55.125
- The diamond.
- The boy's father had

30:55.193 --> 30:58.362
joined with a couple of thieves
to steal a precious diamond.

30:58.430 --> 31:02.164
They replaced it with a glass replica
so no one would know it was gone.

31:02.232 --> 31:04.133
And what happened to the father?

31:04.201 --> 31:05.769
He was double-crossed.

31:05.836 --> 31:09.038
The henchman, Moran, shot
him on the orders of Moriarty,

31:09.106 --> 31:10.775
but not before he hid the diamond

31:10.776 --> 31:12.633
where only his son
would know where to look.

31:12.743 --> 31:14.210
And where was that?

31:14.278 --> 31:16.578
I don't know. He promised his son

31:16.646 --> 31:18.814
a clue would come to
him, but none ever did.

31:18.882 --> 31:21.316
And what was this boy's name?

31:21.384 --> 31:26.922
If memory serves me correctly,
his name was David Kingsley.

31:31.609 --> 31:34.410
- Isn't David Kingsley Sherlock's real name?
- It is.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.446
So you're thinking he's remembering details

31:36.513 --> 31:38.781
of an actual crime committed
when he was a 13-year-old boy?

31:38.849 --> 31:41.618
That's right. Sir, perhaps Aurora is

31:41.685 --> 31:44.887
- the clue that David Kingsley never received.
- Bloody hell.

31:44.955 --> 31:47.156
Maybe it was a reference
to The Sign of Four.

31:47.224 --> 31:49.258
His father must have known

31:49.325 --> 31:51.293
that he liked Sherlock Holmes.

31:51.361 --> 31:53.462
Perhaps. But, sir, what puzzles me is

31:53.529 --> 31:56.831
that David Kingsley's father died in 1878.

31:56.899 --> 31:59.234
David would have only been an infant.

31:59.302 --> 32:02.771
So, who's the father in this story?

32:05.340 --> 32:08.776
The man you're talking
about is, uh, Ted Hopkins.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.078
- As in Edward Hopkins?
- He's a no-good

32:11.146 --> 32:13.481
who took up with David's
mother after his father died.

32:13.548 --> 32:17.351
Would David have considered Mr.
Hopkins his father, by chance?

32:17.419 --> 32:20.587
Yes, which made what he did so despicable.

32:20.655 --> 32:22.889
What did he do?

32:22.956 --> 32:25.958
The bastard bolted when
the going got tough;

32:26.026 --> 32:30.096
left David to nurse his
dying mother all by himself.

32:30.164 --> 32:32.899
Actually, we suspect that
Mr. Hopkins was killed

32:32.966 --> 32:35.201
in a criminal double-cross some years ago.

32:35.269 --> 32:37.202
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

32:37.270 --> 32:39.204
He consorted with that type.

32:39.272 --> 32:43.208
Mr. Kingsley, does the word
"Aurora" mean anything to you?

32:43.276 --> 32:44.910
Aurora?

32:44.977 --> 32:47.112
No. Why do you ask?

32:47.180 --> 32:49.932
It was a message left in a safe deposit box

32:49.933 --> 32:50.933
that belonged to Mr. Hopkins.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.918
We suspect it has something to do

32:53.985 --> 32:57.188
with the name of a boat
from a Sherlock Holmes story.

32:57.255 --> 33:00.157
Sunrise.

33:00.225 --> 33:03.260
- I'm sorry?
- Aurora means sunrise.

33:10.768 --> 33:14.404
Detective. I could find no
reference to the Star of Tarsus,

33:14.472 --> 33:17.140
but there is a diamond
called the Star of Tehran,

33:17.208 --> 33:18.323
and it's here in Toronto.

33:18.324 --> 33:20.605
It's currently being housed
at the Persian consulate.

33:20.678 --> 33:23.879
- How big is it?
- Forty-three carats.

33:23.947 --> 33:28.317
- That'd be worth a bob or two.
- That's $100,000 exactly.

33:28.385 --> 33:30.720
Well, we'll need the consulate
to verify if it's genuine.

33:30.787 --> 33:32.755
Sir, it's being done as we speak.

33:32.823 --> 33:34.289
So, what now?

33:34.358 --> 33:37.493
We need to speak with David Kingsley.

33:45.801 --> 33:49.237
You're weightless, free
from all constraint.

33:49.304 --> 33:52.039
You have no body.

33:52.107 --> 33:54.542
Can you feel the chair beneath you?

33:54.610 --> 33:56.477
No.

33:59.248 --> 34:01.015
Who are you?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.217
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

34:05.854 --> 34:07.788
Who is David Kingsley?

34:07.856 --> 34:10.491
He was a client of mine.

34:13.327 --> 34:15.695
Let's go back to your 13th birthday.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.730
Where are you?

34:19.699 --> 34:21.301
I'm at home in Knightsbridge.

34:21.369 --> 34:26.273
My brother Mycroft is visiting from Oxford.

34:26.340 --> 34:28.340
I've never seen anything like this.

34:28.408 --> 34:31.043
He's created a complete
history for himself.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.212
Can you break him out of that?

34:33.280 --> 34:35.214
I don't know.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.949
Um...

34:37.016 --> 34:39.118
bring him out.

34:39.185 --> 34:43.277
At the count of three, you
will be fully awake.

34:44.036 --> 34:48.492
One, two, three.

34:53.132 --> 34:57.068
Dr. Ogden, may I have a
few moments with Mr. Holmes?

34:57.136 --> 34:58.769
Of course.

35:03.007 --> 35:06.509
Mr. Holmes,

35:06.577 --> 35:11.013
how did you deduce that it was the
henchman that killed David's father?

35:11.081 --> 35:13.082
I didn't. David, saw it.

35:13.150 --> 35:16.719
He was hiding in a closet when
Moran came in and shot his father.

35:20.925 --> 35:23.359
When did you first see Moran?

35:23.427 --> 35:25.861
In Switzerland.

35:25.929 --> 35:29.765
Then how did you know it was
the same man that David saw?

35:32.368 --> 35:36.672
Hmm? Think, Mr. Holmes.

35:36.739 --> 35:40.976
Switzerland could not have been
the first time you saw Moran.

35:44.146 --> 35:46.547
Why are you badgering
me with these trifles?

35:46.615 --> 35:48.483
Not trifles.

35:48.550 --> 35:52.053
You claim to have recognized
a man that you've never seen.

35:52.121 --> 35:54.456
Think, Mr. Holmes.

35:54.523 --> 35:57.458
When did you first see him?

36:07.602 --> 36:10.537
Was it you hiding behind that door?

36:12.506 --> 36:15.041
No, that was David.

36:17.111 --> 36:19.678
Then how do you remember him?

36:19.746 --> 36:21.680
It must be your memory.

36:21.748 --> 36:24.517
You saw Moran walk in

36:24.584 --> 36:27.020
- and shoot your father.
- No, David did!

36:31.124 --> 36:33.725
Did David see Moriarty?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.693
No.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.163
He was in the shadows.

36:38.231 --> 36:40.265
That's why your only
remembrance of Moriarty is

36:40.333 --> 36:42.367
from the illustration from a book.

36:42.435 --> 36:47.038
You've never seen Moriarty because
David has never seen Moriarty.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.740
- You stop this!
- You are not Sherlock Holmes!

36:49.807 --> 36:51.542
You are David Kingsley!

36:51.609 --> 36:54.245
You were the young boy
who saw his father killed

36:54.312 --> 36:57.314
- in front of him.
- This is impossible.

36:57.382 --> 37:01.051
Recognizing the face of a man
you have never seen is impossible,

37:01.085 --> 37:03.486
and if you eliminate the
impossible, what remains,

37:03.554 --> 37:05.788
however improbable, must be the truth!

37:05.856 --> 37:08.425
- Stop this, please!
- Tell me who you are!

37:08.492 --> 37:12.128
I'm David Kingsley! Now will
you just leave me alone?!

37:23.639 --> 37:25.674
I'm sorry, David.

37:27.643 --> 37:32.480
How long have I been pretending
to be Sherlock this time?

37:32.548 --> 37:33.981
I don't know.

37:34.049 --> 37:36.284
As long as I've known you.

37:38.253 --> 37:40.688
I thought it was over.

37:40.755 --> 37:43.124
I thought I was better.

37:45.094 --> 37:47.528
I always thought

37:47.596 --> 37:53.200
of Ted as my father, and
in every sense he was.

37:53.267 --> 37:55.502
We both loved Sherlock Holmes.

37:55.570 --> 37:58.671
He used to read the stories to me.

37:58.739 --> 38:01.874
What about "The Case of the Vanished Star"?

38:01.942 --> 38:05.777
He told that story to me
the night before he died.

38:05.845 --> 38:08.280
I think he suspected they
were going to kill him.

38:08.348 --> 38:12.084
But he wasn't certain, so
he told you what happened

38:12.152 --> 38:14.120
in the form of a Sherlock Holmes story.

38:14.187 --> 38:17.022
Knowing that if he was killed,

38:17.090 --> 38:19.057
you would understand
that the story was true...

38:19.126 --> 38:22.393
that the diamond actually existed.

38:22.461 --> 38:25.430
And that's why he put the
clue in a safe deposit box.

38:25.498 --> 38:27.332
He assumed it would be bequeathed to you.

38:27.399 --> 38:28.967
But his body was never found,

38:29.035 --> 38:31.169
so the will was never executed.

38:31.237 --> 38:33.005
Sirs.

38:33.072 --> 38:35.240
May I present...

38:35.307 --> 38:36.807
the Star of Tehran.

38:36.875 --> 38:39.143
Cut glass. Completely phoney.

38:39.260 --> 38:41.428
So the real one was stolen,

38:41.496 --> 38:43.297
exactly like the story.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.299
David, I have one more question.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.768
What does Aurora mean to you?

38:47.836 --> 38:50.437
It was the name of the toy
steamboat I used to sail

38:50.505 --> 38:53.106
on the creek on my father's property.

38:53.174 --> 38:55.108
It was called Sunrise,

38:55.176 --> 38:59.412
but after we read The Sign of
the Four, we called it the Aurora.

39:09.589 --> 39:13.258
Sir, come with me. Stay here.

39:29.307 --> 39:32.176
- Is it in there?
- Agh!

39:32.244 --> 39:34.678
It's not in there.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.081
I don't know if it ever was.

39:37.149 --> 39:40.351
We've been looking for
the stone for 10 years!

39:40.418 --> 39:43.253
- Where is it?
- I honestly have no idea.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.088
Drop the knife.

39:47.591 --> 39:50.526
Sebastian Moran, Oscar
Kingsley, you're both

39:50.594 --> 39:54.030
under arrest for robbery and murder.

39:54.098 --> 39:56.866
- Bloody hell.
- It was you,

39:56.933 --> 39:59.168
Uncle.

39:59.236 --> 40:02.037
All this time, you were Moriarty.

40:02.105 --> 40:05.307
- David, put that down.
- You killed my father!

40:05.375 --> 40:07.009
He was not your father.

40:07.077 --> 40:11.713
He was to me! And you had him killed.

40:11.782 --> 40:14.949
And for what? This?

40:21.356 --> 40:24.859
Squeeze it hard, Uncle. Clasp it lovingly

40:24.927 --> 40:28.429
to your chest, 'cause
you're about to die for it.

40:28.497 --> 40:31.865
- Don't be a fool, son.
- Don't do this, David.

40:31.933 --> 40:34.727
- Sherlock wouldn't do this.
- I'm not Sherlock anymore.

40:35.715 --> 40:36.617
Be him again.

40:37.638 --> 40:40.240
Be the man you were destined to be.

40:40.308 --> 40:42.276
Holmes believed in logic,

40:42.343 --> 40:44.811
deduction, intellect, and
above all, the rule of law.

40:44.878 --> 40:46.712
He killed my father.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.916
Yes, but we've caught him. We've caught him

40:49.983 --> 40:53.319
using the skills that you learned.

40:53.386 --> 40:55.487
If you kill this man,

40:55.555 --> 40:59.558
you will turn your back on everything
that has ever mattered to you.

40:59.626 --> 41:02.894
That isn't who you are.

41:02.962 --> 41:05.630
That isn't the man you want to be.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.143
Gentlemen, shall we?

41:24.842 --> 41:26.442
Sign of the Four.

41:26.510 --> 41:29.345
One of mine, I believe.
I hope you're enjoying it.

41:29.413 --> 41:32.514
Of course. You're off, Mr. Doyle?

41:32.582 --> 41:35.091
Yes. Returning to New York, then
catching a steamship back to England.

41:35.253 --> 41:37.351
I was rather hoping that I could have a

41:37.352 --> 41:40.208
chat with our young Sherlock before I go.

41:40.256 --> 41:41.723
Is he about, perchance?

41:41.791 --> 41:44.026
Oh, he's under observation at the asylum.

41:44.093 --> 41:46.094
No longer, I'm afraid. I
just came from there. In fact,

41:46.162 --> 41:48.429
I have a message from your Dr. Ogden:

41:48.496 --> 41:51.365
"The skeleton trick is
now the coat-rack trick."

41:51.433 --> 41:53.733
She said you'd understand.

41:53.801 --> 41:55.769
- Of course.
- Damn my luck.

41:55.836 --> 41:59.005
I thought I'd milk him
for some more new ideas.

41:59.073 --> 42:01.041
Are you thinking of bringing Holmes back,

42:01.108 --> 42:03.109
- by any chance, Arthur?
- Indeed I am.

42:03.177 --> 42:06.479
I thought I'd written myself into a
corner, but he's given me a way out.

42:06.547 --> 42:07.981
Have a pleasant voyage.

42:08.049 --> 42:09.982
Well, it's always a
pleasure to see you both.

42:10.050 --> 42:12.250
- Arthur.
- Right. Cheerio.

42:15.555 --> 42:17.556
So, it's all wrapped up, then.

42:17.624 --> 42:21.460
Except for the diamond, of course.
I'm guessing that's lost forever.

42:21.527 --> 42:24.029
You know, I'm not so sure.

42:24.097 --> 42:25.423
According to The Sign of the Four,

42:26.522 --> 42:29.376
the treasure was thrown
overboard the steamship, Aurora,

42:29.380 --> 42:32.070
to prevent it from falling
into the wrong hands.

42:32.137 --> 42:35.206
Bloody hell. David said
he sailed his toy boat

42:35.273 --> 42:38.009
on a creek on his father's property.

42:42.647 --> 42:45.949
I was wondering when you'd
figure it out, Detective.

42:46.017 --> 42:48.585
Please returned this to its rightful owner.

42:50.955 --> 42:53.356
The Persian consulate has
offered a substantial reward

42:53.424 --> 42:56.292
for its return. Who shall I say found it?

42:58.261 --> 43:00.362
Sherlock Holmes, of course.

43:00.430 --> 43:02.098
Detective.

43:02.165 --> 43:04.133
Good luck, Mr. Holmes.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.235
- Inspector.
- Mr. Holmes.

43:08.404 --> 43:11.373
He's back to being Sherlock, then.

43:18.481 --> 43:22.784
For him I suspect the fiction in his
life is less painful than the fact.

43:22.852 --> 43:24.386
Hm.

43:25.721 --> 43:27.356
Are you sure we'll be able to see?

43:27.423 --> 43:28.190
Everything!

43:29.959 --> 43:31.792
Next Monday, on an all-new
Murdoch Mysteries...

43:31.860 --> 43:33.694
You, there! You're not
a Peeping Tom, are you?

43:33.762 --> 43:35.396
I suppose this would be a good place

43:35.464 --> 43:36.264
to hide one's secrets.

43:36.331 --> 43:38.132
An all-new Murdoch Mysteries,

43:38.200 --> 43:40.368
next Monday at 9:00 on CBC.
