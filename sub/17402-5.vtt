00:06.838 --> 00:09.518
Tonight... Richard drives
a new Lamborghini.

00:10.114 --> 00:12.354
James and I go on a caravan holiday.

00:13.009 --> 00:16.489
And a rock god
is in our Reasonably Priced Car.

00:16.514 --> 00:21.575

00:24.304 --> 00:29.423
Thank you, everybody! Hello! Hello
and welcome. Thank you, everybody.

00:29.424 --> 00:33.024
Thank you, thanks. Now...

00:35.435 --> 00:41.434
1963 saw the birth of two things
I'm not very interested in.

00:41.435 --> 00:45.075
The Porsche 911 and James May.

00:46.715 --> 00:50.354
Apparently, however, there is
now a new 911, which won't be new

00:50.355 --> 00:54.115
in any way at all,
and James has been driving it.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:04.315 --> 01:06.714
Here it is. And I agree.

01:06.715 --> 01:08.234
In terms of appearance,

01:08.235 --> 01:12.275
it's changed rather less
over the last 50 years than I have.

01:14.555 --> 01:18.194
The interior may be more ordered,

01:18.195 --> 01:21.514
and Porsche nerds will spot
that it's a couple of inches longer.

01:21.515 --> 01:25.555
But to normal people,
it looks just like another 911.

01:33.915 --> 01:36.914
In truth, though, this is all new.

01:36.915 --> 01:40.194
The body, for example,
is now made from aluminium,

01:40.195 --> 01:43.715
which means it is much lighter -
and lighter is good.

01:45.515 --> 01:49.955
The 3.8 litre flat-six engine
has been upgraded.

01:54.835 --> 01:57.954
There's a new seven-speed
manual gearbox.

01:57.955 --> 02:00.034
Which is fantastic.

02:00.035 --> 02:03.955
And all new suspension,
which does its job impeccably.

02:09.555 --> 02:13.114
For 50 years, Porsche have
bloody-mindedly stuck with

02:13.115 --> 02:17.075
this daft idea of building a car
with the engine at the back, but...

02:19.635 --> 02:23.114
half a century of
consistent fiddling around

02:23.115 --> 02:26.034
and they've made it work
brilliantly.

02:26.035 --> 02:30.395
It's so good that it brought on
a temporary attack of yobbishness.

02:34.915 --> 02:37.595
Turn in, give it
a little squeeze of power.

02:39.635 --> 02:41.235
Feel it all tighten up.

02:42.755 --> 02:44.755
How could you not like a 911?

02:47.635 --> 02:50.914
And that question brings me
on to an important point.

02:50.915 --> 02:54.915
Strange to say it,
but this car has a big problem.

02:57.235 --> 03:00.874
And that problem is
classic 911 enthusiasts.

03:00.875 --> 03:04.514
To them,
this car is the work of Satan,

03:04.515 --> 03:09.754
and simply because it isn't an old
911. I'll give you a good example.

03:09.755 --> 03:13.154
This car has electric
power steering,

03:13.155 --> 03:15.714
and, to be honest,
I'm perfectly happy with it.

03:15.715 --> 03:17.154
So would you be, I'm sure.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.154
And if you put
electric power steering

03:19.155 --> 03:23.194
on a Lamborghini or a Maserati,
nobody would bat an eyelid.

03:23.195 --> 03:27.354
But on a 911, this simple
technical development has turned

03:27.355 --> 03:30.114
the faithful into an angry,
roaring mob,

03:30.115 --> 03:34.234
storming up from the village with
pitchforks and blazing effigies,

03:34.235 --> 03:35.715
shouting, "Witchcraft!"

03:37.755 --> 03:42.554
What they actually want in
a new 911 is a 911 that's new

03:42.555 --> 03:44.554
and yet not new.

03:44.555 --> 03:46.515
What they want is this...

03:51.715 --> 03:55.075
the work of a small Californian
company called Singer.

03:57.155 --> 03:59.874
This looks like an old 911,

03:59.875 --> 04:04.315
and some of its parts are indeed
cherry-picked from past 911s.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.115
But the whole car is custom-built.

04:12.835 --> 04:16.675
And, where necessary,
it's peppered with modern touches.

04:29.115 --> 04:33.475
The engine is another classic 911
3.8 litre flat-six.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.594
But this one has been fettled
by Cosworth in California,

04:38.595 --> 04:41.995
and develops 360 horsepower.

04:43.035 --> 04:44.355
And a lovely buzz.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.874
Gets you in there.

04:49.875 --> 04:54.274
And although the body may look like
it's come from a 1960s Porsche,

04:54.275 --> 04:57.595
almost all of it has been
remodelled in carbon fibre.

05:00.155 --> 05:05.514
The result of that is that this
911 weighs 200 kilograms less

05:05.515 --> 05:06.875
than a new one.

05:10.555 --> 05:14.114
That's like taking a Harley Davidson
out of the luggage compartment.

05:14.115 --> 05:18.435
So, yes, it is a tribute band,
but it can rock like the original.

05:19.635 --> 05:21.195
No, better, actually.

05:24.915 --> 05:28.194
The precision on the steering -
you didn't feel that,

05:28.195 --> 05:31.875
obviously, because you're not in
here, but it's utterly intuitive.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.074
Look, it's an old 911,
it feels old,

05:35.075 --> 05:38.595
and then I get to the hammerhead,
and the brakes are tremendous.

05:43.195 --> 05:48.754
0-60 takes 4.5 seconds, and the
top speed is 175 miles an hour.

05:48.755 --> 05:52.595
But, actually, in this car,
those figures are irrelevant.

05:56.795 --> 06:00.034
The interesting thing is,
they could've overdone this.

06:00.035 --> 06:03.514
I mean, it would be possible to
put the turbo engine in this car,

06:03.515 --> 06:06.674
they could have made it ludicrously
powerful, but they haven't.

06:06.675 --> 06:10.274
They've concentrated on
the sensation of performance,

06:10.275 --> 06:13.034
the noise, the vibration,
the feel of the steering.

06:13.035 --> 06:14.755
That's what actually matters.

06:18.355 --> 06:20.194
Before we go any further,

06:20.195 --> 06:23.314
you're probably wondering
what all this excellence costs.

06:23.315 --> 06:29.915
Well, the bottom line is, it's a
lot. Around £280,000, in fact.

06:33.115 --> 06:36.034
Now, that is a lot of money
for a car, I know.

06:36.035 --> 06:39.434
But, then again, £50,000 is a lot
of money for one of those Dior

06:39.435 --> 06:42.474
couture dresses,
until I learned that

06:42.475 --> 06:47.754
over 2,000 hours of immaculate
handiwork goes into making it.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.794
It's the same with the car.

06:49.795 --> 06:54.154
The monks of this monastery of
the 911 have prostrated themselves

06:54.155 --> 06:58.155
before their icon and anointed it
with exquisite gifts.

07:05.595 --> 07:09.434
Each of these cars
takes 4,000 man-hours to make.

07:09.435 --> 07:13.754
And each one features unique
touches - like the rev counter

07:13.755 --> 07:17.795
in this one, that goes up to 11
as a tribute to Spinal Tap.

07:19.435 --> 07:20.954
What this is, in truth,

07:20.955 --> 07:25.675
is more than just the perfect bauble
for the devoted 911 enthusiast.

07:27.835 --> 07:32.234
What this is... Well, it's a
bit like the Eagle E-Type that

07:32.235 --> 07:38.595
Jeremy drove a few series back.
It's a love letter to a car.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.074
Can I just say... Hold on a minute.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.394
That steering - what do you
mean you're perfectly happy

07:58.395 --> 08:02.674
with the electric steering on the
new 911? I don't think it matters.

08:02.675 --> 08:05.954
But the steering was the defining
characteristic of any

08:05.955 --> 08:09.074
of the generations of 911.
It's about how it feels.

08:09.075 --> 08:11.554
You said how the steering feels.
I know, you're right.

08:11.555 --> 08:13.874
You're talking about
the little patter thing inside.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.394
Well, I know what you mean.
But it's better.

08:16.395 --> 08:20.234
But that means they've changed it.
Shut up!

08:20.235 --> 08:23.714
All 911s are exactly the same.

08:23.715 --> 08:29.634
That's like saying all babies are the
same. They are! They are identical.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.234
And that one that Singer
has modified, that is

08:32.235 --> 08:35.313
completely different.
Oh, he's still going on about it.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.474
It's like a sort of 911
greatest hits.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.794
That's like a Showaddywaddy
greatest hits!

08:41.315 --> 08:44.554
Can we please stop
talking about the 911?

08:44.555 --> 08:47.194
Please, let's do the news,
let's do the news. OK.

08:47.195 --> 08:49.594
And now, it's time for the news.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.994
Porsche has announced a new 911.

08:51.995 --> 08:56.554
Oh, for crying out loud. I'm going.
Oh, this is going to be good!

08:56.555 --> 09:01.154
It revs to 9,000rpm. Shut up
about your glorified Beetle!

09:01.155 --> 09:03.274
It's not a Beetle,
it's a magnificent thing.

09:03.275 --> 09:05.754
That is going to be about £100,000,
the end of this year,

09:05.755 --> 09:08.674
it'll be here. It's going to be
wonderful. All right, all right.

09:08.675 --> 09:09.954
We'll move it on.

09:09.955 --> 09:11.955
Now, there is a new Porsche 911.

09:13.075 --> 09:16.314
This is the Turbo and the Turbo S.

09:16.315 --> 09:18.514
Clues to identification
begin with that...

09:18.515 --> 09:21.514
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Didn't Porsche say a while back

09:21.515 --> 09:24.954
they were never going to make
another 911 Turbo?

09:24.955 --> 09:28.114
Actually, they did in the '90s,
they did say that. Exactly.

09:28.115 --> 09:30.795
So, not only are they
crap engineers, they're liars.

09:32.275 --> 09:36.114
You cannot level crap engineers
at Porsche. Yes, I can. Yes, I can.

09:36.115 --> 09:37.514
They haven't evolved.

09:37.515 --> 09:39.794
They had one idea and
they just produced it

09:39.795 --> 09:41.714
year after year after year.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.835
You've got to move on.
Look at this show...

09:52.315 --> 09:55.674
Maybe we can edit that out.
We'll edit that out.

09:55.675 --> 09:57.314
So, that's interesting.

09:57.315 --> 10:01.594
So, what you're saying is, Porsche
had an idea and stuck with it,

10:01.595 --> 10:04.035
and I respect them for that.

10:09.635 --> 10:14.474
Right, let's move onto proper news.
Oh, now, yes. Bad news.

10:14.475 --> 10:19.194
Mr Cameron has decided there should
be a ban on internet pornography.

10:19.195 --> 10:20.835
What are you going to do?

10:22.035 --> 10:25.474
That means we will no longer be
able to look at pictures like this.

10:25.475 --> 10:27.195
Wait a minute, is this wise?!

10:28.435 --> 10:32.674
He hasn't banned it yet. Have a look
at this. Oh, I see what you mean.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.154
Oooh.

10:34.155 --> 10:39.154
That is strong pornography. It is.
It's actually a one-off Lamborghini.

10:39.155 --> 10:42.234
It's called the Selfish.
It's not called the Selfish.

10:42.235 --> 10:44.794
It is. It's called the Egoista.
It's Italian for "selfish".

10:44.795 --> 10:46.834
Anyway,
you won't be able to see that.

10:46.835 --> 10:48.914
And nor will you be
able to see this.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.515
In what way is that pornography?
Well, it's orange.

10:54.355 --> 10:56.074
The thing is -
this is a true story, OK?

10:56.075 --> 10:59.394
A friend of mine has a website,
and it has an orange backdrop.

10:59.395 --> 11:03.314
Now, in various offices and work
places that have this porn filter

11:03.315 --> 11:06.914
on the internet, OK, orange
is picked up as a skin tone -

11:06.915 --> 11:09.634
which, of course,
it is in Cheshire, yeah?

11:09.635 --> 11:13.394
It's picked up, so it will just
see that as a naked lady with

11:13.395 --> 11:16.434
a sort of vajazzle in the shape
of a Renault badge.

11:16.435 --> 11:18.194
And then it won't let anyone see it.

11:18.195 --> 11:21.754
So Mr Cameron's porn filter
is just going to stop us

11:21.755 --> 11:23.594
looking at things that are orange?

11:23.595 --> 11:26.194
Yeah, David Dickinson's had it.
He's gone!

11:26.195 --> 11:29.394
I think it's a bit more
sophisticated than that.

11:29.395 --> 11:32.594
I think it looks for words and
things as well. On search engines.

11:32.595 --> 11:35.514
Certain words? Obviously.

11:35.515 --> 11:37.194
Volvo. They've had it.

11:37.195 --> 11:38.314
Why?

11:38.315 --> 11:41.195
Well, it's a bit close to...
Oh, I see!

11:42.835 --> 11:44.794
What about Fuchs alloys?

11:44.795 --> 11:47.554
You're never going to be able
to see a Fuchs alloy.

11:47.555 --> 11:49.195
Bell helmets. No.

11:50.355 --> 11:52.314
You can't look at them.

11:52.315 --> 11:54.554
You know we were doing
the Africa special last year,

11:54.555 --> 11:58.634
and I got my BMW stuck on that
termite mound thing, and I said,

11:58.635 --> 12:01.714
"Right, James, you reverse onto me,

12:01.715 --> 12:03.795
"and Hammond tug me
off from behind."

12:06.355 --> 12:10.634
I said that. That won't be
showing up on iPlayer.

12:10.635 --> 12:12.595
No, Mr Cameron, don't ban it.

12:13.715 --> 12:17.114
Now, Ford has obviously decided
the problem with modern cars

12:17.115 --> 12:19.434
is they don't have enough
radiator grilles,

12:19.435 --> 12:21.794
so this is their new one,
this is the EcoSport.

12:21.795 --> 12:24.834
It has one, two, three, four,
five radiator grilles.

12:24.835 --> 12:26.994
It's only got a one-litre
engine under there -

12:26.995 --> 12:29.274
it's going to need a blanket,
it'll be draughty.

12:29.275 --> 12:32.114
It'll be shivering in a corner,
"I'm cold!"

12:32.115 --> 12:35.514
That massive car hasn't got
a one-litre engine. No, it's not
massive.

12:35.515 --> 12:39.794
It looks it, but it's basically a
Fiesta on stilts, it's a small car.

12:39.795 --> 12:43.114
Can I just say,
the thing that baffles me most

12:43.115 --> 12:46.194
about this car - I'm going
to quote for you here, OK?

12:46.195 --> 12:50.794
It says, "As a first in Europe,
the Ford's SYNC App Link system

12:50.795 --> 12:54.954
"will offer drivers voice control
of mobile apps on the move,

12:54.955 --> 12:57.954
"including the music streaming
service Spotify."

12:57.955 --> 13:01.395
Does anyone here have the first
idea what any of that means?

13:02.795 --> 13:06.514
Does anyone really know? What is it?
Spotify? What is Spotify?

13:06.515 --> 13:08.194
It's a music streaming service,

13:08.195 --> 13:12.154
so you can listen to music over
the internet. Any music? Any music.

13:12.155 --> 13:15.994
So, if I were just driving along
and I said "Roxanne", it would

13:15.995 --> 13:20.674
play Roxanne? Maybe. Well,
hang on, that's not going to work.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.714
Because we know the voice
recognition in cars is rubbish -

13:23.715 --> 13:26.274
it never works, does it?
So, if you just say, "The Police",

13:26.275 --> 13:28.435
it will probably actually
ring the police.

13:29.795 --> 13:31.394
No, it will! It will, it will!

13:31.395 --> 13:34.754
Because this car's got a feature
on it that if you have an accident

13:34.755 --> 13:38.234
or get into problems, it calls
the emergency services for you.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.554
Well, that's just
a recipe for disaster.

13:40.555 --> 13:43.274
You'll be sitting there going,
"Right, get the fire brigade,"

13:43.275 --> 13:44.794
and it would play The Move!

13:44.795 --> 13:47.394
♪ Get the fire brigade
get the fire brigade! ♪

13:47.395 --> 13:50.874
"I'm in trouble, help!"
♪ I need somebody, help! ♪

13:50.875 --> 13:53.834
What a terrible way to die,
trapped in your car,

13:53.835 --> 13:56.995
listening to all the embarrassing
rubbish on your iPod.

13:58.155 --> 14:00.634
Anyway, so that won't work.
Let's move on.

14:00.635 --> 14:03.034
Good news, ladies and gentlemen.

14:03.035 --> 14:05.514
Dacia has announced a special,

14:05.515 --> 14:09.594
limited-edition,
black version of the Duster.

14:09.595 --> 14:12.314
Oooh.

14:12.315 --> 14:13.714
No, hang on a minute.

14:13.715 --> 14:16.594
I mean, I normally go,
"brilliant" and move on,

14:16.595 --> 14:19.314
but that's black
like a Mercedes 6.2 V8?

14:19.315 --> 14:21.955
No. It's literally black.

14:23.275 --> 14:26.194
I was going to say they've
painted it black - actually,

14:26.195 --> 14:29.114
they haven't painted it. They've
done a wrap in like a bin liner.

14:29.115 --> 14:31.834
So there's a blue edition and
a yellow edition and a white one.

14:31.835 --> 14:36.194
It's just a black car. That's a bit
daft. Now, can I just say something?

14:36.195 --> 14:40.554
As we know, the heatwave ended
spectacularly in Britain on Tuesday.

14:40.555 --> 14:43.194
Many storms, we've got some
pictures of the aftermath here.

14:43.195 --> 14:45.755
I'm not gloating, but call me Noah.

14:46.995 --> 14:49.714
I mean, this guy, with his BMW,
very proud of it,

14:49.715 --> 14:52.835
but at that moment he's thinking,
"I wish I had that hover van."

14:54.115 --> 14:55.874
I told you!

14:55.875 --> 14:57.554
Now, a couple of weeks ago,

14:57.555 --> 15:00.754
we drove across Spain
in three budget supercars.

15:00.755 --> 15:04.634
Lamborghini then got in touch
and said they'd built one too.

15:04.635 --> 15:07.915
Better still, they invited me
over to Italy to drive it.

15:20.995 --> 15:23.755
So, here we are.

15:25.915 --> 15:31.595
Budget car, Lamborghini style.
The Aventador Roadster.

15:33.795 --> 15:35.674
As you'd expect from Lamborghini,

15:35.675 --> 15:40.954
it's basically a roofless wedge
of ginormous numbers.

15:40.955 --> 15:43.315
700 horsepower.

15:44.555 --> 15:48.834
217 miles an hour, 6.5 litre V12.

15:48.835 --> 15:52.674
£289,000. The only small number?

15:52.675 --> 15:56.915
0-60 - three seconds.
You get where I'm going.

16:00.195 --> 16:04.715
It also handles beautifully,
easily as sharp as the hardtop.

16:06.075 --> 16:09.074
But I'm not going to spend
my time today doing a big,

16:09.075 --> 16:12.234
technical assessment of this car's
driving dynamics and such,

16:12.235 --> 16:16.554
because what I'm interested in
is why this car perfectly sums up

16:16.555 --> 16:19.995
what's so special about Lamborghini.

16:29.435 --> 16:31.314
You see, most sports car companies,

16:31.315 --> 16:34.394
a lot of their appeal
comes down to their heritage.

16:34.395 --> 16:39.114
Cars named after famous race tracks,
famous races -

16:39.115 --> 16:41.794
Mille Miglia, Lamont, and the like.

16:41.795 --> 16:44.754
But Lamborghini has never
bothered with any of that.

16:44.755 --> 16:48.914
Their mission has always been to make
the best bedroom wall poster

16:48.915 --> 16:52.595
subjects in the world -
always looking forward.

16:53.635 --> 16:55.274
Never back.

16:55.275 --> 16:58.914
Look at this thing.
It's just pure theatre.

16:58.915 --> 17:01.074
Everything is dialled up to 11.

17:01.075 --> 17:05.434
It brings out the nine-year-old
inside every 40-year-old.

17:05.435 --> 17:07.394
43... 38.

17:07.395 --> 17:10.515
Middle-aged. Early middle-aged man.

17:13.234 --> 17:16.874
What's really astonishing is
they've been pulling off this trick

17:16.875 --> 17:19.513
for 50 years now.

17:19.515 --> 17:24.874
That's five decades of unleashing
unique, flamboyant machines,

17:24.875 --> 17:28.955
each more outrageous than the last.

17:32.475 --> 17:35.834
The thing is, that's kind of a
high risk strategy, cos how do

17:35.835 --> 17:41.834
you keep doing extreme, year after
year after year, for 50 years?

17:41.835 --> 17:43.794
What do you come up with next?

17:43.795 --> 17:46.114
Well, let's find out what, shall we?

17:46.115 --> 17:50.314
Because, in truth, this isn't
the car they rang us about.

17:50.315 --> 17:54.875
The car they rang us about
makes this look dull.

18:16.275 --> 18:21.354
It's called the Sesto Elemento,
Italian for "sixth element".

18:21.355 --> 18:26.794
And in the periodic table, that
sixth element is carbon, which is

18:26.795 --> 18:30.754
no coincidence, because this thing
is made from little else.

18:30.755 --> 18:32.954
The prop shaft, the suspension -

18:32.955 --> 18:36.955
even the wheel rims are
all forged from carbon.

18:39.235 --> 18:42.754
And the body is made from
a revolutionary blend of plastic

18:42.755 --> 18:46.555
and carbon, jointly developed
by Lamborghini and Boeing.

18:49.875 --> 18:54.034
Such an extreme car
deserves an extreme location.

18:54.035 --> 18:57.955
Which is why we've returned
to the fearsome Imola racetrack.

19:04.115 --> 19:08.034
Right. Last time I was here,
I was in a Noble M600,

19:08.035 --> 19:11.315
which, as we know, is no slouch.

19:13.315 --> 19:16.954
Let's give it a shot. Three...

19:16.955 --> 19:19.035
Let's just do it.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.715
It's different! That's what it is!

19:40.275 --> 19:42.755
It's super fast.

19:44.155 --> 19:45.755
God, it nearly wheelies.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.594
The reason it's so fast is not only

19:51.595 --> 19:55.354
because it's powered by
a 570 horsepower V10,

19:55.355 --> 19:58.354
but also because,
despite that massive engine,

19:58.355 --> 20:00.914
and a full four-wheel-drive system,

20:00.915 --> 20:03.555
it weighs less than a Ford Fiesta.

20:04.715 --> 20:08.795
That means 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds.

20:10.795 --> 20:14.114
The same as a Veyron.

20:14.115 --> 20:15.915
Holy moly!

20:17.555 --> 20:22.635
Now, there are other supercars
that are fast because they're light.

20:24.435 --> 20:29.395
But no car is as extreme as this
in the pursuit of shedding weight.

20:31.235 --> 20:34.674
The Sesto Elemento doesn't even have
paint.

20:34.675 --> 20:39.275
Instead, its colour comes from flecks
of crystal embedded in the bodywork.

20:40.395 --> 20:43.154
And there's more.

20:43.155 --> 20:47.194
These seats, they're not actually
seats, they've just made these pads

20:47.195 --> 20:50.474
in a seat shape and stuck them
directly onto the chassis.

20:50.475 --> 20:53.114
And the dashboard, there isn't one.

20:53.115 --> 20:56.754
Instead you get this exposed
carbon plastic composite

20:56.755 --> 21:01.114
but what I love is the way they've
done all this brutal simplicity

21:01.115 --> 21:04.114
and weight-saving in an Italian way.

21:04.115 --> 21:05.754
It's beautiful.

21:05.755 --> 21:08.795
This central spar looks like it
belongs in a modern art gallery.

21:16.795 --> 21:19.674
Yet despite its many unique
qualities,

21:19.675 --> 21:24.434
the Sesto Elemento does share one
thing with other high-end
sports cars.

21:24.435 --> 21:27.115
Its ability to empty
your bank account.

21:28.195 --> 21:34.234
I think Lamborghini has learned
from Porsche the art of charging
more for less.

21:34.235 --> 21:37.434
So this thing, with its missing
dashboard and seats, is,

21:37.435 --> 21:39.554
wait for it,

21:39.555 --> 21:42.075
£1.95 million.

21:45.555 --> 21:48.474
However,
there's no time to be shocked by that

21:48.475 --> 21:54.515
because right now I'm in a £2 million
hyper car and I've got it all
to myself.

22:00.355 --> 22:05.355
That moment when it turns in,
it changes direction,
it turns like a swallow.

22:07.155 --> 22:09.514
Because it's light,
you can break so late

22:09.515 --> 22:15.194
and because it's light it can turn so
hard without tearing its own tyres
off.

22:15.195 --> 22:17.834
And because it's light,
when you get out of the turn

22:17.835 --> 22:21.955
the 570-brake horsepower V10
just catapults it.

22:34.115 --> 22:36.715
People talk about being at one
with the car.

22:37.715 --> 22:40.315
I've grown a car out of my hands
and feet.

22:42.035 --> 22:46.155
Operating the steering is just
a joyous experience!

22:49.955 --> 22:53.155
It's the most alive thing I've ever
driven. It's beautiful.

22:58.435 --> 23:00.955
Absolutely dazzling.

23:04.315 --> 23:08.234
And when you've finished, you can
get out and remind yourself you've

23:08.235 --> 23:11.195
been driving something
that looks like this.

23:13.275 --> 23:18.514
I've said for some time that
Pagani have been stealing
Lamborghini's crown

23:18.515 --> 23:22.314
when it comes to making
the best bedroom wall poster car

23:22.315 --> 23:27.075
but I think the new boys have just
been slapped down.

23:41.515 --> 23:43.594
It's amazing.

23:43.595 --> 23:47.075
When you say it's light.
Have you seen the windscreen?

23:48.195 --> 23:51.674
That is how light this thing is.
That's not even glass.

23:51.675 --> 23:54.674
It was electrifying to drive
because if you think,

23:54.675 --> 23:57.474
most supercars are broadly the same.

23:57.475 --> 24:00.674
This just felt different.
It feels like the future.

24:00.675 --> 24:03.314
I took it for a spin this morning,
as, you know...

24:03.315 --> 24:08.194
And what I loved about it is
because it's just a Gallardo
underneath it's not intimidating.

24:08.195 --> 24:11.634
It's just fantastically fast
without being terrifying.

24:11.635 --> 24:13.954
It nimble and sharp, it's beautiful.

24:13.955 --> 24:17.314
Anyway, we must now find out how
fast it goes around our track

24:17.315 --> 24:21.594
and that means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

24:21.595 --> 24:25.275
Some say he's married to
one of Princess Anne's hats.

24:26.715 --> 24:30.994
And that he spent all week standing
outside a hospital in London

24:30.995 --> 24:34.314
pretending to be Nicholas Witchell.

24:34.315 --> 24:36.955
All we know he is he's
called The Stig.

24:38.435 --> 24:43.914
And away he goes. No weight so it
takes off like a housefly.

24:43.915 --> 24:47.834
Coming up to the first corner,
shunting power backwards here

24:47.835 --> 24:52.235
to drive it through maintaining
grip. That's controlled.

24:54.115 --> 24:56.715
No stereo
so no TV theme tunes mercifully.

24:58.635 --> 25:00.874
A wiggle through Chicago.

25:00.875 --> 25:04.314
Listen to that noise,
it's spectacular.

25:04.315 --> 25:09.154
Will it understeer or oversteer?
No, it won't do either of them.

25:09.155 --> 25:13.075
A bit of a bounce.
Stig is really on it today.

25:16.555 --> 25:20.914
Right, follow-through.
All 570-horsepower unleashed here.

25:20.915 --> 25:25.994
A bit of a drift. Steady on, Stig.
Wait, he's gone!

25:25.995 --> 25:32.634
He's gone, he's lost it. And he's
on the grass. Oh, my giddy aunt!

25:32.635 --> 25:35.114
Ooh, now that is a surprise.

25:35.115 --> 25:38.994
That's only the second time
he's ever spun off here.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.834
But he did eventually complete a lap
and I have the time here.

25:42.835 --> 25:46.354
This is where
the normal Gallardo got.

25:46.355 --> 25:49.395
But because this is a little bit
lighter, it's quick.

25:51.955 --> 25:54.714
Faster than that.

25:54.715 --> 25:58.194
Is it faster than
the Bugatti Veyron?

25:58.195 --> 26:01.435
Yes, it is. No way! You're not...

26:05.155 --> 26:08.355
Wow! That is amazing!

26:10.755 --> 26:13.155
That's what happens
when you lose weight.

26:14.515 --> 26:15.995
So, that...

26:18.195 --> 26:23.594
That is where it goes on our board
and now it goes on the floor.

26:23.595 --> 26:26.914
No, it must. Sorry because you can't
drive that on the road.

26:26.915 --> 26:29.474
The board is for road cars only.
Those are the rules.

26:29.475 --> 26:33.794
Absolutely and now we must
move on to the film Armageddon.

26:33.795 --> 26:37.274
Ever since I saw that
I've wanted to get the actress

26:37.275 --> 26:40.434
Liv Tyler to appear
in the Reasonably Priced Car.

26:40.435 --> 26:42.194
I have nagged and nagged

26:42.195 --> 26:46.395
and finally last week she agreed...
to send her dad.

26:47.995 --> 26:51.154
Apparently he's a singer in a band
called Aerosmith.

26:51.155 --> 26:54.755
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Liv Tyler's dad.

27:10.675 --> 27:14.954
I would have preferred your daughter
but you'll do. Have a seat.

27:14.955 --> 27:18.554
You'll do. I love you too!

27:18.555 --> 27:20.954
They're happy.

27:20.955 --> 27:24.314
Now, yesterday
we were trying to get hold of you

27:24.315 --> 27:28.754
and we were told by your people that
you were walking round Stonehenge

27:28.755 --> 27:32.435
with the son of God, or, as
we sometimes call him, David Icke.

27:33.595 --> 27:36.154
No, David Icke is quite
the character

27:36.155 --> 27:39.594
and I wanted to find out what it was
all about so I called him up

27:39.595 --> 27:43.034
and said, "Will you take me
around Stonehenge and show me around

27:43.035 --> 27:45.074
"so I can feel the energy
of the place?"

27:45.075 --> 27:48.354
I would have taken you around
Silverstone - it would have
been more fun.

27:48.355 --> 27:52.314
I'd have to check into rehab
again with you! Yeah, you would.

27:52.315 --> 27:57.354
Are you ever in the UK often? Not as
much as I wish I was. Not as much.

27:57.355 --> 27:59.554
The band plays here
and then we are on tour

27:59.555 --> 28:01.354
and we take off and go other places.

28:01.355 --> 28:05.234
In the early days, you went
around pretending to be Mick Jagger,
as I understand.

28:05.235 --> 28:07.635
Oh, jeez, that was 1967.

28:08.675 --> 28:10.874
Actually I pretended
to be his brother

28:10.875 --> 28:13.914
because someone said, "Are you
Mick Jagger?" and I said, "No,

28:13.915 --> 28:17.754
"I'm his brother."
And they believed me.

28:17.755 --> 28:19.794
They chased me down the beach

28:19.795 --> 28:25.394
and I got my first hit of what
it must be like to be a rock star.
And I loved it.

28:25.395 --> 28:30.154
Now, from what I understand,
unusually, you're not here

28:30.155 --> 28:32.874
because you're promoting
something or a new album,

28:32.875 --> 28:36.634
you came over because you wanted to
drive our Vauxhall Astra. I did.

28:36.635 --> 28:41.314
On Top Gear. I did.
My Hennessy venom was very jealous.

28:41.315 --> 28:45.315
You have a Hennessey Venom.
Does anyone here know what that is?

28:46.635 --> 28:50.754
There's nodding going on.
In essence it is a Lotus Exige.

28:50.755 --> 28:54.634
It is, stretched out and it's the
fastest road car there is right now.

28:54.635 --> 29:00.274
I thought it hadn't quite beaten
the Bugatti Veyron
for the ultimate top speed.

29:00.275 --> 29:03.714
It was 265 miles an hour,
did the Venom reach?

29:03.715 --> 29:08.034
I think it beat all
the records in two miles.
Oh, in two miles...

29:08.035 --> 29:11.754
We've got some footage here of
this car doing this record.

29:11.755 --> 29:14.355
You really need to see this.
Here we go.

29:20.475 --> 29:22.435
That's me on Sunset Strip!

29:24.195 --> 29:26.634
To be brutally honest,
from that, which is impressive,

29:26.635 --> 29:28.874
we don't get much of an idea
of what the car looks like

29:28.875 --> 29:32.874
so we've got a still of it so we can
have a look. Are they sandals?

29:32.875 --> 29:36.235
They are. With socks.
With socks. That's right.

29:38.555 --> 29:43.794
There's a motorcycle you've got
called a Confederate Hellcat.

29:43.795 --> 29:49.674
I mean... Phenomenal looking thing.
Have you ridden it? Oh, yeah.

29:49.675 --> 29:53.754
You've got to hold onto
the handlebars for dear life.

29:53.755 --> 29:56.595
Anything worth doing is worth
overdoing.

29:57.715 --> 29:59.434
The Spinal Tap mentality.

29:59.435 --> 30:02.154
And you have a Lotus Seven as well,
don't you? I have a Super Seven.

30:02.155 --> 30:03.514
One of the first things I got.

30:03.515 --> 30:07.674
That I get in every spring
with my son and crank Brian...

30:07.675 --> 30:09.554
has the top speed, does he?

30:09.555 --> 30:12.114
From AC/DC? Brian Johnson? Yeah.

30:12.115 --> 30:17.474
Every spring I get in the car
with my son, bom, dun, un, un...

30:17.475 --> 30:19.634
Dun, un, unt...

30:19.635 --> 30:24.154
So, if you're driving around in that
with AC/DC blaring out,

30:24.155 --> 30:27.515
don't people go, "I'm sure that's
the guy from Aerosmith."

30:28.595 --> 30:31.755
It's like me drumming along
watching Fifth Gear.

30:33.115 --> 30:37.195
Presumably you can't remember what
you were driving in the '80s?

30:39.555 --> 30:44.434
A Porsche. You think? No, I know.
Were you able to drive it ever?

30:44.435 --> 30:47.115
Hell, yeah. I just held one eye.

30:48.155 --> 30:50.634
Because you did
a lot of spells in rehab.

30:50.635 --> 30:55.354
Yeah, when you are in a band
that still working it's

30:55.355 --> 30:58.434
kind of like living on the tail
of a comet and when you

30:58.435 --> 31:03.074
are used to the curtain falling
at Madison Square Garden there is

31:03.075 --> 31:08.234
a certain energy that you don't get
playing ping-pong after the show.

31:08.235 --> 31:10.594
You want to go back with the twins

31:10.595 --> 31:13.594
and drink yourself under the table.

31:13.595 --> 31:16.674
We're not at the watershed yet!

31:16.675 --> 31:19.874
With some twins
and play table tennis with them.

31:19.875 --> 31:23.034
And is Aerosmith coming back,
will we be seeing Aerosmith?

31:23.035 --> 31:26.434
We're on tour right now.
We just did Singapore
for the first time

31:26.435 --> 31:30.834
and we are off to Japan, China and
South America so we are out. Really?

31:30.835 --> 31:34.994
Yeah, yeah. Where'd you think I got
the whatwithal to drive that

31:34.995 --> 31:39.674
thing around the track? This is it.
We are coming onto your lap now.
How was it?

31:39.675 --> 31:44.394
You know what, my mum used to say
don't ever be afraid,

31:44.395 --> 31:50.474
she said amateurs built the Ark
and pros built the Titanic.

31:50.475 --> 31:54.874
Meanwhile, I got in this car
and I was scared to death.

31:54.875 --> 31:59.274
I've never been on a racetrack
before ever. Really? Ever. Ever.

31:59.275 --> 32:01.114
And I didn't know where I was going.

32:01.115 --> 32:05.194
The thing is though I was
actually... Had one ear on the track

32:05.195 --> 32:08.514
and I heard a noise
that sounded biblical.

32:08.515 --> 32:13.715
It sounded like you changed first,
second, third, fourth, first.

32:15.355 --> 32:16.714
That's what it was.

32:16.715 --> 32:20.435
And there was a noise of tremendous
strain and breakage. Yeah.

32:21.595 --> 32:25.955
Was it badly damaged?
We had to change cars. You did.

32:27.475 --> 32:30.874
Presumably it's because you are used
to driving on the wrong
side of the road.

32:30.875 --> 32:35.155
The wrong side... First of all,
I'm listening to The Stig talking
to me like this...

32:37.595 --> 32:39.515
I went, "Right on!"

32:41.155 --> 32:44.554
And I got ears in as if I can hear
anyway with the rock'n'roll

32:44.555 --> 32:47.154
all these years and I'm on that side
of the car

32:47.155 --> 32:51.034
and I'm shifting with this hand.
So I had to pull all that together.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.235
Who would like to see Steven's lap?

32:55.915 --> 32:58.754
In the spare car,
let's have a look.

32:58.755 --> 33:03.634
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith
in the Vauxhall.

33:03.635 --> 33:06.194
Come on, Steve McQueen.

33:06.195 --> 33:09.114
Coming to me, baby. Come on.

33:09.115 --> 33:13.315
Looking good there.
Oh, but not fast.

33:16.515 --> 33:19.915
And around the first corner.
No accidents there.

33:22.075 --> 33:25.274
Did it again.
You don't want to miss a thing.

33:25.275 --> 33:27.395
But you missed third.

33:28.635 --> 33:32.355
And you missed the apex.
But here we go. Tragic!

33:34.275 --> 33:36.595
But it sure is fun.

33:38.435 --> 33:41.274
Here we go, hammerhead.

33:41.275 --> 33:45.514
Understeer, oversteer.
Any speed at all? I'm in the lines.

33:45.515 --> 33:48.354
You were between the lines.
That was very tidy.

33:48.355 --> 33:52.714
And you've used nearly all the road
apart from these three metres.

33:52.715 --> 33:56.434
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.195
Yeah.

33:59.955 --> 34:05.074
Did you keep your foot hard down
through there? You did. Good man.

34:05.075 --> 34:09.594
And through there? Yeah.
Stig did that earlier and crashed.

34:09.594 --> 34:11.994
Bet he didn't mention that.

34:11.995 --> 34:16.034
Right, another apex not quite here
and what about Gambon?

34:16.034 --> 34:18.274
Oh, yes it's wide
but there we are,

34:18.275 --> 34:20.795
ladies and gentlemen,
across the line.

34:26.235 --> 34:28.514
Well done. Damage report.

34:30.114 --> 34:33.914
Damage report. Damage reports.

34:33.915 --> 34:40.034
Well, in fact we're bookended
by Mike Rutherford out of Genesis,

34:40.034 --> 34:41.994
1.51.5 at the bottom

34:41.995 --> 34:44.674
and then Brian at the top
and other people in the middle.

34:44.675 --> 34:47.074
I've got the time here.
Let's have a look.

34:52.275 --> 34:53.995
It was a one.

34:57.074 --> 35:01.274
Then I'm afraid it was five.

35:01.275 --> 35:02.634
Oooh!

35:02.635 --> 35:04.954
Then there was another one.

35:04.955 --> 35:07.314
But happily for you it was a nought.

35:07.315 --> 35:10.995
So, you are not actually
the slowest we've ever had.

35:20.195 --> 35:24.674
No wonder The Stig kept saying would
you like to go round one more time?

35:24.675 --> 35:30.034
I'm looking for something I can give
you that's a crumb of comfort.

35:30.035 --> 35:34.315
You're not the fastest American
because that would be Ron Howard.

35:35.835 --> 35:41.274
Not the fastest... You're 65 now,
aren't you? Cor blimey.

35:41.275 --> 35:44.234
You're not the fastest pensioner
because that's Brian Johnson,

35:44.235 --> 35:45.674
you're not the fastest...

35:45.675 --> 35:49.754
You're just not very good at driving
a Vauxhall Astra. That's all.

35:49.755 --> 35:52.874
You should have sent Liv.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.794
I should have sent my son, Taj.
Is he good? Oh, he's great.

35:55.795 --> 35:57.555
No, you still should have sent Liv.

35:59.275 --> 36:02.795
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been
a huge pleasure. Steven Tyler.

36:14.595 --> 36:19.114
Now, on this show
we like to test cars for everybody -

36:19.115 --> 36:22.954
rock stars,
billionaires, Arab oil sheiks.

36:22.955 --> 36:26.594
We like to think we're more
inclusive than the BBC

36:26.595 --> 36:28.115
regional news programme.

36:29.475 --> 36:34.194
But there's one group of motorists
that we always ignore. caravannists.

36:34.195 --> 36:38.594
Yes, and because there are
half a million caravans in Britain,

36:38.595 --> 36:41.594
we buy more caravans
than any other European nation,

36:41.595 --> 36:45.354
the producer said that Jeremy
and I should address this issue.

36:45.355 --> 36:48.794
Yes, they told us
to do a proper comparison test

36:48.795 --> 36:53.315
like they do in Which? magazine
and they told us not to muck about.

36:58.475 --> 37:01.554
These are the cars caravannists
like.

37:01.555 --> 37:04.794
Jacked-up diesel hatchbacks
with part-time four-wheel-drive

37:04.795 --> 37:08.035
so we can deal with muddy campsite.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.034
They're all terrible.

37:13.035 --> 37:16.754
I know they're all terrible
but they're very popular.

37:16.755 --> 37:19.674
The Nissan Kumquat is the sixth
bestselling car in Britain.

37:19.675 --> 37:23.834
We have to decide which one of these
is best. You mean the least worst.

37:23.835 --> 37:25.794
All right, the least worst.

37:25.795 --> 37:29.155
Right, you pick a key and we'll
start with that. Here we go.

37:31.035 --> 37:34.234
I think this is how most caravanners
end up with their cars.

37:34.235 --> 37:38.875
They just get the keys from
a bowl at a party. Toyota RAV4.

37:45.195 --> 37:47.714
Here it is,
it has a 2.2 litre engine,

37:47.715 --> 37:53.794
prices start at £22,000. However,
it does sit in a rather high

37:53.795 --> 37:55.434
insurance group and for that reason,

37:55.435 --> 37:58.914
because we have to be ruthless,
we must eliminate it straightaway.

37:58.915 --> 38:02.074
Good work, James.
Crisp delivery, full of facts.

38:02.075 --> 38:07.834
However, this is a Mitsubishi
Outlander. Is it? It's not a RAV4.

38:07.835 --> 38:10.555
They all look exactly the same.

38:12.395 --> 38:15.714
To try and find some differences,
we took them all for a spin

38:15.715 --> 38:19.195
and very soon
we came to a startling conclusion.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.554
They're all exactly the same
to drive as well -

38:23.555 --> 38:25.995
they are all very dreary.

38:27.155 --> 38:31.554
Let me explain my problem
with cars of this type.

38:31.555 --> 38:33.834
This is a Honda Civic,
this is a Honda CRV.

38:33.835 --> 38:38.114
They have exactly the same engine,
they seat the same number of

38:38.115 --> 38:42.714
people and they have the same level
of crash protection and safety.

38:42.715 --> 38:46.834
But caravanners choose the CRV,
which is more expensive to buy,

38:46.835 --> 38:50.154
more expensive to run
and nowhere near as nice to drive

38:50.155 --> 38:53.714
because it suits their annual
holiday requirement.

38:53.715 --> 38:56.994
And that's like clomping
around in ski boots all year

38:56.995 --> 38:59.194
because every February you
go to the Alps.

38:59.195 --> 39:02.394
I mean, I like snorkelling
but I don't go shopping

39:02.395 --> 39:06.194
every day in a face mask because it
saves me the bother of...

39:06.195 --> 39:11.074
As Jeremy ranted on, I drew up a big
chart showing all the facts

39:11.075 --> 39:13.554
that caravannists care about.

39:13.555 --> 39:19.154
Insurance, CO2 emissions,
maximum towing weights and so on.

39:19.155 --> 39:22.995
And with this,
we could start to see what's what.

39:24.475 --> 39:28.194
This is the chart our researchers
have drawn up.

39:28.195 --> 39:30.474
And straightaway
we can see there's a problem with

39:30.475 --> 39:35.914
the Peugeot 3008
which is the... blue one.

39:35.915 --> 39:40.154
It's the brown one.
Well, whatever. Look here.

39:40.155 --> 39:43.554
The maximum towing weight
on average is two tonnes,

39:43.555 --> 39:48.274
the Chevrolet two tonnes, the Ford
is 2.1, two tonnes, two tonnes.

39:48.275 --> 39:49.474
But the Peugeot,

39:49.475 --> 39:53.714
because it's a hybrid, it can only
pull half a tonne.

39:53.715 --> 39:55.674
It couldn't even pull me.

39:55.675 --> 39:57.714
It's a good point, it's significant

39:57.715 --> 40:01.794
and the Nissan Kumquat may be
the sixth bestselling car in Britain

40:01.795 --> 40:05.434
but look, 1.4 tonnes
against generally two tonnes.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.194
We'll eliminate both those...

40:07.195 --> 40:09.634
This is very professional work
we're doing here!

40:09.635 --> 40:12.274
And I think we must turn now
to price, because I'm just

40:12.275 --> 40:16.474
looking here at the Chevrolet
Captiva, it's over £28,000.

40:16.475 --> 40:18.354
And look at its insurance group!

40:18.355 --> 40:21.594
Yes, and the road tax because
it's not that good on emissions.

40:21.595 --> 40:24.674
So you'd eliminate the Captiva
for being too expensive?

40:24.675 --> 40:27.274
Yes, and I would like to
draw your attention to this,

40:27.275 --> 40:28.914
the SsangYong Korando.

40:28.915 --> 40:31.874
Under £19,000, can you see
anything wrong with that?

40:31.875 --> 40:33.475
Yes, I'd rather have warts.

40:35.075 --> 40:38.834
'We spent several hours
going through all the numbers

40:38.835 --> 40:41.914
'in a professional,
caravan club-type way,

40:41.915 --> 40:45.874
'until we were left
with just two cars.

40:45.875 --> 40:51.395
'The Mazda CX-5 and the
top-selling Volkswagen Tiguan.

40:53.035 --> 40:56.634
'On paper, both are well priced
and both have low emissions

40:56.635 --> 41:01.954
'and frugal diesel engines,
but which is the least worst?'

41:01.955 --> 41:06.034
To find out, we've devised a
series of caravan-relevant tests,

41:06.035 --> 41:07.234
starting with,

41:07.235 --> 41:10.434
"Which one can do the best J-turn?"

41:10.435 --> 41:12.394
'The Mazda went first.'

41:12.395 --> 41:13.995
OK, here we go.

41:16.595 --> 41:21.074
Ready, brake and spin it
round into first, and away.

41:21.075 --> 41:22.394
Not bad.

41:22.395 --> 41:24.834
Not bad at all.

41:24.835 --> 41:28.354
'But before I tried the VW,
there was a problem.'

41:28.355 --> 41:30.794
What does he want?

41:30.795 --> 41:32.674
James! He says it's not...

41:32.675 --> 41:37.114
What does he want? He says it's
not very relevant to caravanning.

41:37.115 --> 41:39.955
What isn't? J-turns.

41:41.035 --> 41:45.394
Don't caravanners do J-turns?
He says no.

41:45.395 --> 41:49.794
Well, there we are, so that's not
a relevant test, as it turns out.

41:49.795 --> 41:53.074
'To get a better idea of
what tests we should be doing,

41:53.075 --> 41:57.955
'we were told to spend a day with
our cars living like caravannists.'

41:59.075 --> 42:02.554
Er, right, James is
in the wrong car.

42:02.555 --> 42:04.275
Cock!

42:06.195 --> 42:10.994
'First of all, we decided to
go to something called the tip,

42:10.995 --> 42:15.595
'which we'd been told is
something caravannists do a lot.'

42:17.435 --> 42:19.714
There's one there that
you can throw your bra in.

42:19.715 --> 42:23.074
Why would you throw your
bras away? Or your clothes?

42:23.075 --> 42:26.394
Or your mobile phone, why would you
throw your mobile phone away? Look!

42:26.395 --> 42:29.154
Washing machines! "What shall
we throw away today, darling?"

42:29.155 --> 42:31.874
"The spin dryer, shall we throw
that away? "What's for supper?"

42:31.875 --> 42:34.554
"I've thrown the cooker away."
Cos that's what they've done.

42:34.555 --> 42:36.675
They've just come and
thrown their cookers away.

42:38.755 --> 42:39.995
It's brand new!

42:42.555 --> 42:47.474
That man just pulled up in his
Mercedes and threw this away.

42:47.475 --> 42:52.994
It's dirty but it even...
Look, barcode!

42:52.995 --> 42:58.235
He's just bought this from a shop,
come down here and thrown it away.

42:59.315 --> 43:01.634
She's got something else.
Is it massive?

43:01.635 --> 43:02.874
It's the wardrobe door.

43:02.875 --> 43:05.714
She's just taken the door off
the wardrobe and thrown it away.

43:05.715 --> 43:07.874
'Before leaving this strange place

43:07.875 --> 43:10.434
'we did something else
caravanners enjoy.

43:10.435 --> 43:12.155
'We washed our cars.'

43:16.675 --> 43:20.035
'And then we went to
caravannist heaven.'

43:23.075 --> 43:25.555
Is this any good?
Well, there's some chain.

43:33.195 --> 43:35.354
Plastic sheeting.

43:35.355 --> 43:37.914
"Suitable for domestic use."
We need a bit more heavy duty.

43:37.915 --> 43:39.674
Wait a minute.

43:39.675 --> 43:42.074
'Soon our trolley was
full of many things

43:42.075 --> 43:44.754
'we thought caravanners might buy.'

43:44.755 --> 43:46.674
Quick lines, shovels...

43:46.675 --> 43:48.754
Zinc tub, axes...

43:48.755 --> 43:51.675
Duct tape, saws, rope.

43:53.115 --> 43:56.594
'We then took all our
new stuff to the tip

43:56.595 --> 43:58.195
'and threw it away.'

44:01.595 --> 44:03.275
'Having washed our cars again...'

44:07.315 --> 44:11.114
'..we set off for the
garden centre, and on the way,

44:11.115 --> 44:15.194
'I tried to solve a knotty problem.'

44:15.195 --> 44:21.034
Last year, in Britain, 10,500
people bought a Volkswagen Tiguan.

44:21.035 --> 44:24.394
3,000 bought a Mazda CX-5.

44:24.395 --> 44:27.034
Even though the Mazda is
less expensive to buy,

44:27.035 --> 44:29.994
it uses less fuel,
it's cheaper to insure,

44:29.995 --> 44:34.234
it's kinder to Johnny Polar Bear,
so the road tax is cheaper.

44:34.235 --> 44:35.754
So why? What's wrong with it?

44:35.755 --> 44:39.075
What is it that puts a
caravanner off this car?

44:40.355 --> 44:44.515
'At the garden centre,
I thought I'd found the answer.'

44:46.555 --> 44:48.115
What was that?!

44:50.315 --> 44:51.435
What did I just hit?

44:53.435 --> 44:55.755
It's got automatic brakes!

44:58.035 --> 45:00.234
It stopped without me asking it to,

45:00.235 --> 45:02.954
cos it thought I was
going to hit the hedge.

45:02.955 --> 45:04.794
Get in.

45:04.795 --> 45:06.834
Right. Try and run me down.

45:06.835 --> 45:09.355
Oh, all right.

45:12.035 --> 45:16.275
Now, if this doesn't work, you all
heard him say, "Try to run me down."

45:17.915 --> 45:19.035
Urgh!

45:20.635 --> 45:25.635
'In order to be even more thorough,
I decided to test it on James' car.'

45:26.675 --> 45:28.155
Here we go, ready.

45:33.195 --> 45:34.315
'You fooled it.'

45:36.235 --> 45:37.634
'A bit baffled,

45:37.635 --> 45:42.075
'we went back to the job of getting
into a caravanning state of mind.'

45:46.075 --> 45:48.915
Pansies, there we go!
Are those petunias?

46:06.155 --> 46:08.874
Look at that.
That is a duck. That is a duck.

46:08.875 --> 46:10.635
Put it in the book.

46:16.995 --> 46:20.194
'Things were going well,
but as night fell,

46:20.195 --> 46:24.994
'I realised the earlier crash
had broken my Mazda's intercooler.'

46:24.995 --> 46:28.074
Engine inspection required,
there's an engine warning light,

46:28.075 --> 46:29.514
every warning light there is.

46:29.515 --> 46:32.034
Right, this is not going
much further, so I'm going to

46:32.035 --> 46:36.195
shove it in that car park over there
and we'll just wait for a tow truck.

46:38.275 --> 46:40.874
'Weirdly, this remote
woodland car park

46:40.875 --> 46:43.755
'was full of other cars
just like mine.'

46:46.195 --> 46:47.994
Look at this.

46:47.995 --> 46:50.234
This is really clever.

46:50.235 --> 46:54.234
You can have one
interior light on, or two, or...

46:54.235 --> 46:55.554
all four.

46:55.555 --> 46:58.954
Dim, bright, dim, bright.

46:58.955 --> 47:01.275
Dim, bright.

47:09.355 --> 47:11.315
This is so dirty.

47:14.955 --> 47:17.195
That's got it. There you go.

47:19.595 --> 47:22.354
Is that Stan Collymore over there?

47:22.355 --> 47:24.475
Flash your lights.

47:27.075 --> 47:28.754
Yeah.

47:28.755 --> 47:31.355
No! No, it's Phil Mitchell.

47:32.635 --> 47:35.715
'We were waiting in the
car park for quite some time.

47:37.355 --> 47:40.875
'And the following morning,
the memories were still with us.'

47:45.835 --> 47:48.434
'But having spent
the day as caravanners,

47:48.435 --> 47:52.195
'we did at least know how we
SHOULD be testing our cars.'

47:53.475 --> 47:55.634
'So, we put the Stig into the VW,

47:55.635 --> 47:57.554
'hitched it up to a caravan

47:57.555 --> 47:59.914
'and asked him to set a lap time.'

47:59.915 --> 48:02.435
Three, two, one, go!

48:06.955 --> 48:09.475
What just fell over in there?
Scrabble.

48:11.955 --> 48:13.154
We should explain,

48:13.155 --> 48:16.634
the Volkswagen has a part-time
four-wheel drive system

48:16.635 --> 48:20.955
which will cut in should sensors
detect he's about to lose control.

48:22.835 --> 48:24.034
He probably is there.

48:24.035 --> 48:27.074
Now there can be feeding power to
the back end as well. He's through.

48:27.075 --> 48:29.594
He's through, he's looking
good there, looking good.

48:29.595 --> 48:31.875
Coming up to Chicago.

48:34.035 --> 48:35.674
Bit wobbly! He's very wobbly there!

48:35.675 --> 48:37.434
Look at that, he's
completely sideways.

48:37.435 --> 48:39.314
He's gathered it up
with an armful of oppo,

48:39.315 --> 48:41.155
which is what you
should do if that happens.

48:43.235 --> 48:45.275
That's a five-wheel drift!

48:49.515 --> 48:55.554
Top speed of the Tiguan with the
caravan attached is just 70mph.

48:55.555 --> 48:58.634
Whoa! But look at that.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.994
This, I think, is an
object lesson for caravanners.

49:00.995 --> 49:03.834
There's no need to dawdle,
you really can get your foot down.

49:03.835 --> 49:07.435
The wheel! No! It's come off!

49:10.435 --> 49:13.675
He's still going. I know he is!
We should move back.

49:15.835 --> 49:19.675
He's coming in a shower of sparks
towards the line.

49:22.155 --> 49:24.274
And across the line!

49:24.275 --> 49:28.995
Two minutes, 15.82. So there we are.

49:30.195 --> 49:32.235
'Next, it was the
turn of the Mazda.'

49:33.355 --> 49:35.874
Three, two, one...

49:35.875 --> 49:38.155
Oh-h-h-h!

49:41.195 --> 49:44.194
Right, now, we should bear in mind

49:44.195 --> 49:47.914
the Mazda has ten more
horse powers than the Volkswagen.

49:47.915 --> 49:50.315
It has 30 or 40 more torques.

49:53.875 --> 49:56.594
'In theory, then,
it should be faster.

49:56.595 --> 49:58.074
'However...'

49:58.075 --> 50:01.795
Smoke coming off the brakes.
Smoke pouring off the brakes! Whoa!

50:08.995 --> 50:11.914
'Having declared the Tiguan
the victor by default,

50:11.915 --> 50:13.794
we took the Stig to the tip

50:13.795 --> 50:15.915
and threw him away.

50:18.475 --> 50:21.474
'Then, as we were leaving,
the producers ambushed us

50:21.475 --> 50:22.835
'with a challenge.'

50:25.035 --> 50:26.994
"You are stupid idiots."

50:26.995 --> 50:29.514
Er, hello! Ooh!

50:29.515 --> 50:32.954
"J-turns and high-speed laps
with the Stig are not relevant.

50:32.955 --> 50:35.834
"In order to determine which
of your cars is actually best,

50:35.835 --> 50:39.914
"YOU will now do some caravanning."

50:39.915 --> 50:42.154
Really?
I knew it would come to this. Go on.

50:42.155 --> 50:46.234
"We have booked one luxury space
at an exclusive caravan site

50:46.235 --> 50:48.634
"in the prestigious New Forest.

50:48.635 --> 50:51.755
"The one who arrives last
sleeps the night."

50:54.875 --> 50:58.794
'The start point was
several miles away from the site.

50:58.795 --> 51:02.954
'So, while James applied some
comedy stickers to his Hurricane XL

51:02.955 --> 51:07.395
'and my Hurricane GTX,
I studied the map.'

51:08.635 --> 51:10.634
So, there's the caravan site.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.554
Now, I could drive to it
on the roads,

51:13.555 --> 51:16.554
but that would be anti-social,
I would hold people up,

51:16.555 --> 51:19.954
people who are going about
their lawful business.

51:19.955 --> 51:23.755
Er, so why don't I just drive
cross-country? I mean, it's...

51:25.315 --> 51:27.835
It's not exactly
the Himalayas, is it?

51:29.195 --> 51:30.955
'With our vans loaded...

51:32.155 --> 51:33.675
'we were ready to go.'

51:41.395 --> 51:42.435
Hey!

51:43.675 --> 51:44.954
No, no, no, no.

51:44.955 --> 51:49.234
Ah-ha-ha! Yes, the mighty...!

51:49.235 --> 51:52.595
No! No, no, how's he done that?!

51:54.075 --> 51:56.874
'Annoyingly, James had
not only taken the lead

51:56.875 --> 52:00.755
'but he'd also had the same
idea as me about going off-road.'

52:01.755 --> 52:03.915
That's tracking straight and true.

52:06.275 --> 52:08.874
No way Jeremy can get past here.

52:08.875 --> 52:11.354
Trying for an overtake.

52:11.355 --> 52:12.515
Not happening.

52:17.475 --> 52:19.035
Come on, May!

52:20.515 --> 52:23.554
'Soon, we had different
ideas about which way to go.'

52:23.555 --> 52:24.835
Urgh!

52:26.995 --> 52:29.395
It's a bit choppy
but I think it's shorter.

52:30.515 --> 52:32.754
'And with Mr Slowly out of the way,

52:32.755 --> 52:36.035
'I could unleash the
more powerful Mazda.'

52:37.355 --> 52:38.635
Come on!

52:40.555 --> 52:43.235
Ye-e-e-es!

52:47.675 --> 52:48.835
Agh!

52:51.515 --> 52:52.835
Up we go.

52:56.555 --> 53:01.675
It's amazing the ease with which the
CX-5 is pulling the Hurricane GTX.

53:04.395 --> 53:07.675
This is what this car
was designed to do.

53:09.995 --> 53:13.314
Get you the best
plot on the campsite.

53:13.315 --> 53:15.675
Oh, no! No!

53:17.275 --> 53:20.835
'Meanwhile, my shortcut
had got a bit boggy.'

53:25.955 --> 53:27.674
So nearly out.

53:27.675 --> 53:31.195
If I could just get it to climb up
onto that other ratty bit...

53:33.955 --> 53:36.794
That's coming, here we go.

53:36.795 --> 53:39.354
Yes! Ha-ha!

53:39.355 --> 53:42.555
If you've got one of these,
you can do that!

53:44.315 --> 53:48.434
'I, meanwhile, had found a track
where I could go even faster.'

53:48.435 --> 53:52.314
Yeah, that is very quick now.
It's good, looking good.

53:52.315 --> 53:53.435
'However...'

54:01.155 --> 54:02.834
Oh, look at this.

54:02.835 --> 54:06.434
The sheer torque of the
2.2 litre turbo-diesel engine

54:06.435 --> 54:08.755
has ripped the front
from the Hurricane.

54:12.595 --> 54:18.394
'And I couldn't back off because
suddenly James was right behind me.'

54:18.395 --> 54:20.195
Hee-hee!

54:21.315 --> 54:24.194
Coming up on me, he's gaining!

54:24.195 --> 54:25.635
'And then...'

54:27.235 --> 54:30.235
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, no.

54:35.755 --> 54:39.914
This is disastrous, I'm actually
driving through Jeremy's caravan!

54:39.915 --> 54:44.234
James, are things as bad back
there as I suspect they are?

54:44.235 --> 54:47.074
Well, let me put it this way,
I've run over your left hand wall.

54:47.075 --> 54:49.355
Oh, and your portable lavatory!

54:53.915 --> 54:56.674
'Then, things got even worse.'

54:56.675 --> 54:58.355
Now we're on somebody's lawn!

55:00.115 --> 55:04.475
Come on, come on,
mighty 2.2 litre diesel!

55:06.955 --> 55:08.355
Oh, no!

55:11.435 --> 55:14.515
A very big catastrophe
has befallen me!

55:16.915 --> 55:19.234
I could actually overtake now
but this is too amusing.

55:19.235 --> 55:21.395
I've got to...!

55:27.195 --> 55:29.634
'Sadly, I was laughing so much,

55:29.635 --> 55:32.314
'I crashed...into myself.'

55:32.315 --> 55:33.875
I've spun!

55:36.195 --> 55:39.194
'This, combined with
Jeremy's drastic weight loss,

55:39.195 --> 55:41.755
'meant he could scamper away.'

55:48.035 --> 55:52.515
60mph, this is
caravanning at its best.

55:54.555 --> 55:59.394
'And by my reckoning, the site was
now just a couple of miles away.'

55:59.395 --> 56:05.155
Victory now is mine, I will not be
sleeping in what remains of the van.

56:08.395 --> 56:10.795
Whoa, it's a biggie!

56:13.795 --> 56:16.475
'Worried that I might be
sleeping in my van...

56:18.875 --> 56:21.115
'I kept my foot hard down.'

56:24.195 --> 56:26.315
Hurricane XL holding up well.

56:32.755 --> 56:33.915
Ooh, bloody hell!

56:35.595 --> 56:38.955
Ha-ha! The XL refuses to die!

56:43.435 --> 56:45.754
'I, meanwhile, had
arrived at the site

56:45.755 --> 56:49.235
'and was looking for the
prestigious Plot 200.'

56:50.835 --> 56:52.675
Where's Plot 200, Plot 200?

56:57.595 --> 57:01.555
Yes, in here, by this stagnant pond.

57:05.355 --> 57:09.314
202...201...

57:09.315 --> 57:12.834
Plot 200 is vacant,

57:12.835 --> 57:17.315
which means
I don't have to stay in it. Yes!

57:22.035 --> 57:23.114
So, there we are.

57:23.115 --> 57:26.834
After the most exhaustive
caravan test in all of history,

57:26.835 --> 57:31.354
we have established that
10,500 people are just plain wrong.

57:31.355 --> 57:35.195
The Volkswagen Tiguan
is NOT the best tow car.

57:36.795 --> 57:38.035
Oh, is that James?

57:48.275 --> 57:50.714
No way!

57:50.715 --> 57:54.275
Plot 200, James, it's all yours!

57:57.395 --> 58:00.674
Where's the...?! I claim the
moral victory. Why a moral victory?

58:00.675 --> 58:02.954
I've still got a caravan.
Well, not really!

58:02.955 --> 58:06.554
You haven't got a wheel, where's
the wheel gone? Well, what's that?!

58:06.555 --> 58:10.595
Anybody like a cup of tea?
Yes? Jolly good.

58:19.915 --> 58:22.595
Excellent. Really thorough.

58:23.995 --> 58:26.794
A proper grown-up test.

58:26.795 --> 58:28.754
Guys, I must say,

58:28.755 --> 58:32.234
it was great to see you two
actually being sensible for once.

58:32.235 --> 58:35.314
But, if I might have a word,
your conclusion,

58:35.315 --> 58:37.674
you said the Mazda was best.

58:37.675 --> 58:41.314
But, let's be honest, a 3mph
impact destroyed its intercooler.

58:41.315 --> 58:43.474
That is true. That did happen, yes.

58:43.475 --> 58:45.474
And in fairness, it was so powerful

58:45.475 --> 58:49.434
it actually tore a caravan
to pieces. It did, it did.

58:49.435 --> 58:52.754
And so, on that basis,
I would have the VW Tiguan.

58:52.755 --> 58:55.074
Well, no, you see,
the thing is, I wouldn't,

58:55.075 --> 59:00.074
because a Volkswagen Golf is
£4,000 less expensive than a Tiguan,

59:00.075 --> 59:01.474
so I'd buy one of those.

59:01.475 --> 59:05.755
Then I'd take the £4,000 that I'd
saved to the tip and throw it away.

59:07.075 --> 59:10.194
No, what I'd do, actually,
I'd spend the £4,000

59:10.195 --> 59:14.795
on a fortnight's holiday in
the south of France in a HOTEL.

59:15.795 --> 59:18.594
Have we just done some
actual consumer advice there?

59:18.595 --> 59:20.234
Yes, I think we have. Yeah, we have.

59:20.235 --> 59:23.314
We have also managed to
go through a whole show
