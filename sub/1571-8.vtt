ANNOUNCER (over TV):
We now return to <i>Home Alone</i>
<i>with Competent Robbers.</i>

00:44.010 --> 00:45.978
Hey, be careful. There's
cars on the floor here.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.679
Thanks.
That's weird, huh?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.148
Yeah. The doorknob
was really hot,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.683
but I just let go instead
of holding onto it.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.019
And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

00:54.021 --> 00:56.488
so I guess just
don't go down there.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.791
Just so you guys know,
I have a tarantula.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.028
Well, now there
are no witnesses.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.664
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the mall.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.699
It's time for the
Christmas Carnival.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.035
It's Stewie's
first Christmas.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.036
Again?

01:11.038 --> 01:14.073
I love the
Christmas Carnival!

01:14.075 --> 01:15.340
Chris, calm down.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.875
You're giving
yourself a nosebleed.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.011
You know, the best thing
about the Quahog Mall

01:19.013 --> 01:21.513
is going into Tiffany's
and doing everything possible

01:21.515 --> 01:23.849
to make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.051
Oh, this is lovely.
Just lovely.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.252
How much is this?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.854
$1,200.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.854
Great, great.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.357
That's all? A-And how late
are you open this evening?

01:32.359 --> 01:33.358
Until 7:00.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.393
Perfect, perfect.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.695
And you accept
credit cards and cash?
Yes.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.896
And what's your name?

01:37.898 --> 01:40.032
I want to make sure you
get credit for this sale.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.201
Evan.
Oh, that's a great name.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.735
Oh, and these watches here,

01:43.737 --> 01:46.071
if I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

01:46.073 --> 01:48.941
could they each get
engraved individually?
Yes.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.609
And you do that on site?
Yes.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.713
Fantastic. Now, the groomsmen's
names are Blake, Hayden, Edgar,

01:54.715 --> 01:57.883
Blake D., Elliott,
Milo, Cooper...

01:57.885 --> 01:59.718
Why aren't you writing
any of these down?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.321
You're wearing Sbarro
wrappers for shoes, sir.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.158
There <i>may</i> have been
a trade.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.767
Hey, nice outfit.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.103
Fancy pair of shoes, too.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.906
Do you, do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

02:20.908 --> 02:24.076
Great question,
smart guy.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.911
What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.079
And the big Christmas tree?

02:27.081 --> 02:28.113
Oh, look, there's Santa.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.281
Peter, no.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.916
That's a Hells Angel.

02:30.918 --> 02:31.917
What do you want?

02:31.919 --> 02:32.784
Meth?

02:32.786 --> 02:33.819
Okay.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.088
There's no
Christmas Carnival, Dad.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.422
You seem to know
a lot about this, Meg.

02:37.424 --> 02:38.423
What did you do?

02:38.425 --> 02:40.159
No Christmas Carnival?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.760
Whoever is responsible
for this

02:41.762 --> 02:43.262
shall suffer
my eternal wrath.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.930
(chuckles)
Who's this guy?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.498
Tough don't sell
in curly-toed shoes.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.933
Leave me alone.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.003
Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at Macy's?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.638
I want something I
can wear on the street

02:52.640 --> 02:55.307
that a broad can smell
on a fire escape.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.676
There's gotta be
an explanation for this.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.111
Let's ask that security guard

02:59.113 --> 03:01.113
who has everything on
his belt except a gun.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.115
E-Excuse me, sir?

03:03.117 --> 03:03.949
It's "officer."

03:03.951 --> 03:06.285
No, it's not.
It's barely "sir."

03:06.287 --> 03:07.486
Yeah, I know.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.521
Where is
the Christmas Carnival?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.123
Canceled.
I don't know why.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.458
I'm just a small cog
in this operation.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.826
You hear that, Dad?

03:14.828 --> 03:17.362
You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.165
PETER and LOIS:
I told you that
in confidence, Chris.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.134
Daddy, where's Santa?

03:22.136 --> 03:24.002
Was he killed by Muslims?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.971
Oh, my God,
poor Stewie.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.973
He's so
disappointed.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.975
Of course he is, Lois.
I feel the same way.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.977
How come every time
I'm feelin' happy,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.779
somebody's gotta
come along and ruin it?

03:34.981 --> 03:36.381
Are you enjoying
your coffee, sir?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.317
Yeah, it's very
smooth. Good flavor.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.553
What if we told you that
we secretly replaced your coffee

03:41.555 --> 03:42.988
with Folgers Crystals?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.356
Wouldn't you
feel like a dumbass?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.491
'Cause of how you just
raved about it just now?

03:46.493 --> 03:48.560
You stupid
son of a bitch.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.069
Boy, Stewie was
really upset

03:57.071 --> 03:59.504
about the Christmas
Carnival being canceled.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.872
He's been acting
out all week.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.008
Ah, I'm sure he'll
be over it in no time.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.577
Besides, how much trouble
can he cause? He's a baby.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.116
(hisses)

04:16.022 --> 04:19.858
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
We now return to
<i>Miracle on 134th Street.</i>

04:19.860 --> 04:22.694
Oh, my God, I left
my phone in my car.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.163
Wow, it's still there.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.939
Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.041
Turns out I know a guy
who knows a guy

04:36.043 --> 04:37.943
who knows another guy
who knows a girl,

04:37.945 --> 04:40.279
which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

04:40.281 --> 04:42.914
who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

04:42.916 --> 04:44.449
some guy named
Carter Pewterschmidt.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.951
Oh, my God.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.887
So I got another guy workin'
on findin' out who that is.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.921
It's my father.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.891
Oh! This is a twist
I did not expect.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.228
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "Oh" this out

04:56.230 --> 04:58.230
until I'm not
surprised anymore.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.899
Oh! Oh! Oh.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.069
Oh... Oh. Oh.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.071
Lois, before I get mad
at your dad,

05:06.073 --> 05:07.773
h-he isn't the Little
Caesars guy, is he?

05:07.775 --> 05:08.974
No, Peter,
we've been through this.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.976
Good. I could never
be mad at that guy.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.944
He says my favorite word
twice in a row.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.813
Now, I'm gonna go
talk to your father

05:14.815 --> 05:16.748
and get him to bring back
the Christmas Carnival.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.250
Peter, I don't think
that's gonna work.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.785
Sure, it will.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.920
The nerve of your dad, takin'
the fun out of Christmas,

05:21.922 --> 05:24.156
like some kind of
gluten-free Santa.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.658
Hey. Hey,
what's in these?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.926
Huh?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.095
I'm okay if it's,
like, coconut flour.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.597
But anything with actual
grains, I can't do.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.932
I'm not sure.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.168
Well, who <i>is</i> sure?

05:40.473 --> 05:42.174
(squeaking)

05:46.946 --> 05:48.313
WOMAN:
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
there's a man here

05:48.315 --> 05:50.949
who says he's the guy whose
picture is on all the money.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.584
Holy cow. Send him in.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.287
Griffin.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.989
That's right, and this is my
own <i>People</i> magazine from home

05:57.991 --> 05:59.624
and not from your
waiting room just now,

05:59.626 --> 06:01.526
and why did you cancel
the Christmas Carnival?

06:01.528 --> 06:02.861
Because I hate Christmas.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.297
You know what it's like being
rich at Christmas, Griffin?

06:05.299 --> 06:08.867
Everyone expects an expensive
present, and I get nothing.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.636
Did you... did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

06:11.638 --> 06:12.971
No.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.972
Sheesh, Carter,
you know what?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.141
I am gonna help you find
the Christmas spirit

06:16.143 --> 06:17.542
so you bring back
the carnival.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.810
Look, are we done here?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.178
Um, yeah, uh, just
one more thing.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.981
Can I choose one
thing in your office
to take home with me?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.316
No.

06:24.318 --> 06:28.153
Aw, too bad. 'Cause I
was gonna choose you.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.422
You're weird.
You're a weird guy.

06:36.996 --> 06:39.197
No. No-no, no.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.465
I want to zip it.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.902
(grunts)

06:43.904 --> 06:46.571
It's okay, Peter,
you're good at other stuff.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.006
So you're gonna
help your old man

06:48.008 --> 06:50.075
find his Christmas
spirit again, huh?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.843
Oh, yeah, that
sounds real bad,

06:51.845 --> 06:53.745
her father don't
like Christmas.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.014
My father was drowned
to death in a birdbath

06:56.016 --> 06:57.682
by an officer
of the law.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.850
His will just said,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.086
"Kick Jimmy in the sack
for me. Go, Eagles."

07:01.088 --> 07:02.687
My sympathies, Vinny.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.923
Don't worry about it,
he was a scumbag.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.525
Are you sure
about this, Peter?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.560
I mean, I know
Stewie was disappointed

07:08.562 --> 07:10.429
about the carnival,
but he'll get over it.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.063
He's a happy,
resilient baby.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.398
I don't know, Lois.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.933
I feel like if we
don't do something,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.368
Stewie's first
words are gonna be,

07:16.370 --> 07:17.869
"Why did you
kill Christmas?"

07:17.871 --> 07:19.271
And I want the
carnival back, too.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.873
You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

07:21.875 --> 07:24.075
you know what the thing
is that keeps me going

07:24.077 --> 07:24.876
more than
anything else?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.244
Wonder.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.213
A sense of wonder.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.549
Well, you have your work
cut out for you, Peter.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.385
My father's always
hated Christmas.

07:33.387 --> 07:35.587
Hey, happy June 16.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.722
Thought I'd see how
you like it when someone

07:37.724 --> 07:40.225
breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.793
Hey. Knock it off.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.728
I'm touching this.
And this over here.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.831
You're a creep,
is my point.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.402
All right, Carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

07:50.404 --> 07:51.903
to put you
in the holiday mood?

07:51.905 --> 07:52.971
Write a Christmas letter

07:52.973 --> 07:54.573
to all your friends
and relatives.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.741
And keep in mind,
it's traditional to embellish

07:56.743 --> 07:58.443
a little bit to make
yourself look better.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.078
"Peter had a
great year,

08:00.080 --> 08:01.746
"and is now starting
quarterback

08:01.748 --> 08:03.748
for the Jacksonville
Jaguars."

08:03.750 --> 08:06.084
What? People can easily
fact-check this.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.786
Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.955
"Chris refurbished a
vintage motorcycle,

08:09.957 --> 08:11.756
"and Stewie can
slam-dunk a basketball

08:11.758 --> 08:13.325
from a standing
start..."

08:13.327 --> 08:14.759
Peter, that's
impossible.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.094
Read what it says
about you.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.963
"Lois's father,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

08:17.965 --> 08:19.965
bought a small stool
for his balls."

08:19.967 --> 08:21.266
Damn it, I'm not
proud of that.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.168
Well, you have to
throw in some real facts.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.704
That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.941
Now, everyone knows
the best way to get
the Christmas spirit

08:29.943 --> 08:33.111
is to drink a whole lot
of thick, frothy eggnog.

08:33.113 --> 08:33.945
So get going.

08:33.947 --> 08:34.946
I don't like eggnog.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.014
Drink the nog, Carter.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.349
I don't... I don't want to.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.851
Take it, Carter.
Take all the nog.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.320
(coughs)

08:42.322 --> 08:43.522
No.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.990
Yeah, you like that nog.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.157
Don't spit
the nog out.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.293
Now look at the
camera for a POV shot.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.495
Say thank you with
the nog in your mouth.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.630
Thank you.
Louder.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.964
Thank you.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.367
Good, now go down
to the hotel lobby
and check out

08:55.369 --> 08:56.701
with nog all
over your face.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.802
All right.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.804
You know, I still
don't like Christmas,

08:59.806 --> 09:02.040
but I kind of like
what we just did.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.711
Okay, Carter, a big part
of Christmas is masturbating

09:06.713 --> 09:08.880
like you would any other day
but feeling guilty about it

09:08.882 --> 09:10.749
because it's Christmas.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.823
(sighs) What's
wrong with me?

09:18.825 --> 09:19.824
Griffin,
this isn't working.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.059
What? What do you mean?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.527
I-I'm not getting
the holiday spirit,

09:22.529 --> 09:23.728
so you can stop trying.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.163
But Carter, it's
not just for me.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.565
Think about Stewie.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.366
He's all upset 'cause
there's no carnival.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.868
Heh.
Different dog.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.836
Yeah, this one's, like,
Italian or something.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.038
Anyway, I think
we're done here.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.673
No Christmas Carnival.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.008
Wow, Carter. I had no
idea you were Jewish.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.244
What? Is... is that
how this is coming off?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.579
Yeah, kind of.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.080
I mean, that's what
everyone's saying.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.748
People think I'm Jewish?

09:55.061 --> 09:58.363
Oh, this Christmas Carnival
has everything. Games, food.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.099
Oh, my God, it's the carolers
from <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:04.903
♪ Deck the harrs
with boughs of horry ♪

10:04.905 --> 10:08.540
♪ Fa ra ra ra ra
ra ra ra ra ♪

10:08.542 --> 10:10.241
That's right, America,
don't forget.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.211
Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.246
And flom
not that rong ago.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.048
What's wrong with you,
Stews?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.950
You're next up
to see the big guy himself

10:18.952 --> 10:21.252
and you look like a piece
of spaghetti on the street.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.254
I don't know. I thought
having the carnival back

10:23.256 --> 10:24.556
would make me happy,

10:24.558 --> 10:26.725
but it still feels like
something's missing.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.426
Yeah, it's always somethin'.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.795
Like when I finally got
to sleep with Mary Lou Gallo.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.931
She had a look,
but when you got up close,

10:32.933 --> 10:35.066
she also had a smell.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.068
Oh, Stewie, you're next.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.070
Ho ho ho.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.438
Mall Santa is
brought to you

10:40.440 --> 10:42.641
in part this season
by Chipotle.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.477
Between good and
garbage, it's Chipotle.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.412
So, what do you want
for Christmas?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.314
Oh, what do I want
for Christmas?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.716
What <i>do</i> I want
for Christmas?

10:58.624 --> 11:00.492
You know what I want
for Christmas?

11:00.494 --> 11:02.427
I want my friend back.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.762
Your friend?

11:03.764 --> 11:04.996
Yes. My best friend.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.098
My dog, Brian.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.600
He's dead.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.802
It's our first Christmas
without him

11:10.804 --> 11:13.505
and no one's even
mentioned his name.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.143
I don't care about this stupid
carnival or Christmas.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.945
I don't care about
anything except Brian.

11:20.947 --> 11:24.049
I want Brian.
(sobs)

11:25.985 --> 11:28.953
You want me to put a
dead dog under your tree?

11:28.955 --> 11:30.855
Yes.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.860
(sniffles) And, uh,

11:35.862 --> 11:37.696
I-I'd like
a bike, too.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.639
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>The Year</i>
<i>Without a Santa Claus or Sex.</i>

11:47.641 --> 11:48.873
Daddy, where's
Santa Clau...

11:48.875 --> 11:50.041
I don't know, okay?!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.209
Should I ask Mom?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.713
(laughs) I don't know,
she's so busy with her job.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.981
VINNY:
Hello there, Stewart.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.983
What's this?
What are you doing, Vinny?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.652
Vinny? Who's Vinny?

12:00.654 --> 12:04.222
My name is Brian,
aka your favorite dog.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.057
Hey, whose leg do
you gotta gagoosh

12:06.059 --> 12:08.827
to get an Amaretto Di
Saronno around here?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.662
Oh, forget it, Vinny.
You're not Brian.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.564
Come on, I went through
a lot of trouble.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.667
For example, I know Brian
was rather into politics,

12:15.669 --> 12:17.001
so I read the newspaper.

12:17.003 --> 12:20.171
What is goin' on with
all these politics, huh?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.907
Well, that is about Brian's
level of political awareness.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.342
Yeah, and you know
how Brian wrote

12:24.344 --> 12:25.577
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It?</i>

12:25.579 --> 12:26.911
Well, I wrote
a book, too.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.046
A little
something called

12:28.048 --> 12:29.581
<i>Wish It, Want It,</i>
<i>You Blew It.</i>

12:29.583 --> 12:30.849
Really?

12:30.851 --> 12:33.685
Yup. Let me read
you an expert.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.353
"You wish you
were a millionaire.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.589
"You want more money.
Guess what.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.757
"You blew it.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.525
"You wish you could
change the neighborhood.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.527
"You want to be
a selectman.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.762
"You blew it.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.597
"You wish you could
open up a restaurant.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.599
"You did not want to
pay protection money.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.867
"Knock, knock.
Who's there?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.034
You blew it."

12:50.036 --> 12:50.902
You blew it who?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.070
You blew it bad.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.372
You know what the last
page of the book is?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.941
A mirror. So you can see
exactly who blew it.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.876
Being you.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.911
Look, I appreciate
all this, Vinny,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.046
but there's only one Brian,

13:02.048 --> 13:04.783
and it's tough for me
that he's gone,

13:04.785 --> 13:07.452
especially around the holidays.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.888
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you up.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.223
How about you open up one
of those Christmas presents?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.424
It's from me.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.460
Merry Christmas.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.796
What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.931
That was supposed to
go to somebody else.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.099
I'm very sorry.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.433
Well, my friends,

13:22.435 --> 13:25.069
I think Johnny "The Foot"
Giatelli is dead.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.237
Oh no.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.973
They killed Frankie
"Choo-Choo" Chinelli instead.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.076
You sure that's
what this means?

13:32.078 --> 13:34.412
Could be they killed
Davey "The Box" Frateli.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.647
Ooh.
Ooh.
Ooh.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.248
Hold on, it
could also be

13:37.250 --> 13:39.784
they killed Jimmy
"Tissue Paper" Scungili.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.587
I just saw Jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.088
So maybe
it wasn't Jimmy.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.290
Maybe this
means they killed

13:45.292 --> 13:47.091
Anthony "The Air
Around the Box" Minetti.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.493
(gunshot)

13:48.495 --> 13:49.928
Oh, no, they killed

13:49.930 --> 13:51.796
Sal "Holding The Box
That We Can't Figure Out

13:51.798 --> 13:53.998
What The Box Means" Casella.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.167
Here, I got this
for you, too.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.269
A bowling shirt?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.637
You can wear
it anywhere.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.639
To the beach,
a wedding on the beach,

14:01.641 --> 14:04.108
beach graduation,
beach funeral,

14:04.110 --> 14:06.644
business conference
which could be at a beach,

14:06.646 --> 14:07.812
a stroll
through the park,

14:07.814 --> 14:10.014
should that park be
adjacent to a beach.

14:10.016 --> 14:10.982
Thanks.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.617
What, you
don't like it?

14:12.619 --> 14:13.952
How's about we
go to the mall

14:13.954 --> 14:15.620
and pick out something
you do like?

14:15.622 --> 14:18.122
Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.858
Possibly pick up
a new action figure.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.292
That's the spirit.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.461
All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

14:23.463 --> 14:25.530
before I kick
my own ass.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.537
Okay, Stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.340
I don't know. I hate the toy
store this close to Christmas.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.141
It's always
been picked clean.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.676
There's plenty of
good stuff here.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.679
Look at this, heavy
bronze sheep bookends.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.982
What kid wouldn't want
to play with these?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.850
"Baa. What are
you lookin' at?"

14:45.852 --> 14:47.986
"Not much, that's
what I'm lookin' at."

14:47.988 --> 14:49.020
"You want to have a go?"

14:49.022 --> 14:50.188
"I'd watch what I say

14:50.190 --> 14:52.290
with that other sheep
right behind you."

14:53.158 --> 14:54.726
I played this as a kid.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.828
Course, I had to do
it with ashtrays,

14:56.830 --> 14:58.396
but I think the
sheep is better.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.966
Wait a minute.
Who is that?

15:07.006 --> 15:09.240
I think... I think
I know that boy.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.523
Vinny,
that stocking cap.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.791
It's mine.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.395
That boy is me.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.064
Of course.
It's me from the past.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.033
Several months ago,
I time-traveled ahead

15:35.035 --> 15:36.701
to purchase
that Christmas toy.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.903
I don't understand, so
I'm angry and hungry.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.772
I'm gonna go
punch a sandwich.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.875
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.243
This just
came out today.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.912
(chuckling):
Yeah, I kind of
knew that already.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.548
The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

15:50.550 --> 15:52.050
that other Stewie is wearing.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.885
I must get
my hands on it, Vinny.

15:53.887 --> 15:54.919
Vinny?

15:54.921 --> 15:57.055
That was a
tough sandwich.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.589
As tough as your
mom's fat face.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.891
Hey, leave my mother
out of this.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.393
That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.429
I heard she was
good with her hands.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.730
Nice.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.099
Hey, everybody, we got
a funny sandwich here.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.434
(bleep) (bleep).

16:09.436 --> 16:11.402
Vinny, I need you
to get that Stewie

16:11.404 --> 16:12.770
to take off
his backpack.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.405
Listen, Stewie,
I'm not following.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.740
I don't have time
to explain.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.975
I've got to
steal something...

16:16.977 --> 16:18.776
That's it. You've
already explained.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.578
You got to steal
something. Got it.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.080
Wait-Wait a sec,
what's your plan?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.115
Trust me, I think
I know you well enough

16:24.117 --> 16:25.817
to know how to distract
the other you.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.756
Hey, how you doing?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.992
This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

16:33.994 --> 16:36.294
but, uh, you ever
do any modeling?

16:36.296 --> 16:37.595
Well, not
professionally,

16:37.597 --> 16:39.163
but I-I-I have
thought about it.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.431
You ought to.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.001
What are you, like,
six-three? Six-four?

16:43.003 --> 16:45.103
Y-Y-You're in...
you're in the ballpark.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.437
I-I-I carry
myself taller.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.006
Good posture,
very important.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.640
Oh, I agree.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.209
Let me see, let me see.

16:53.779 --> 16:54.812
That's good.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.147
But I feel like that backpack

16:56.149 --> 16:57.949
might be hiding
some figure flaws.

16:57.951 --> 17:02.353
(laughs) Well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

17:07.626 --> 17:08.993
You know, my friends ask me,

17:08.995 --> 17:11.295
"Stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

17:11.297 --> 17:12.797
This.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.198
This is why.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.870
All right, whatever
you gotta do, do it quick.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.304
The other you
is in the back

17:20.306 --> 17:22.807
changing into a pair of
tap shoes, for some reason.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.876
OTHER STEWIE:
♪ Animal crackers
in my soup... ♪

17:24.878 --> 17:26.377
Hey, where did
that guy go?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.147
Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

17:29.149 --> 17:30.815
to the moment before
Brian got killed

17:30.817 --> 17:31.983
and I can save him.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.052
Oh, yeah, Scott Bakula
and all that.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.887
Yes, Vinny.
Scott Bakula.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.989
Well, thank you
for everything.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.223
You bet.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.160
You realize if I save Brian,

17:42.162 --> 17:43.995
my family won't
get another dog,

17:43.997 --> 17:46.564
which means we
will never have met.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.333
I'll probably
never see you again.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.702
Oh.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.039
So, I think this is good-bye.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.208
Hey, I'm man's best friend,

17:57.210 --> 17:59.811
not some stupid baby's
best friend, right?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.023
Good dog, Vinny.
Good dog.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.859
Georgette,
I'm coming home.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.594
Who the hell is Georgette?

18:19.865 --> 18:21.866
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

18:21.868 --> 18:25.036
but I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.537
God, look at
this day, huh?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.573
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

18:28.575 --> 18:30.541
you'd be working on
one of your machines.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.076
But here we are
enjoying it.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.878
Yes, it is a nice
change of pace.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.947
Oh, wait, I gotta
go grab my knee pads.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.716
I was using them for...
for, for this other thing.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.151
Anyway, I-I'll be
right back.

18:47.726 --> 18:48.993
Brian, look out!

18:51.263 --> 18:52.430
What the hell?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.966
You're alive,
my friend.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.067
What?
Course I'm alive.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.401
What the hell's
going on here?

18:57.403 --> 18:59.070
Brian, that car
killed you.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.573
And when it did, a little
part of me died as well.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.908
I couldn't live without you.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.144
So I came back from the future
to save your life.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.645
Whoa. Wait,
wait a minute.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.913
What are you
talking about?

19:08.915 --> 19:10.248
I saw you destroy
your time machine.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.583
Yes, but luckily, I ran into
another me from the past,

19:12.585 --> 19:14.752
so I stole his return pad
and came back here.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.087
Oh, that reminds me.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.156
I've gotta send this back
where it came from.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.929
Hmm. I'm starting to think
that guy

19:24.931 --> 19:26.430
wasn't a real modeling agent.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.099
And I'm starting to think
that other guy

19:28.101 --> 19:30.434
wasn't a real
penis-butt inspector.

19:30.436 --> 19:34.005
Wow, Stewie, thank you
for saving my life.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.773
You know, a whole
lot of other families

19:35.775 --> 19:37.775
would've just gotten a
different dog and moved on.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.011
Oh, oh, we could,
we could never

19:40.013 --> 19:42.113
do something
like that, Brian.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.115
Stewie, what's
happening to you?

19:44.117 --> 19:46.984
I think... My time line
is being erased.

19:46.986 --> 19:50.188
The time line where
you died no longer exists.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.057
Merry Christmas, Brian.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.993
Hey, who were you
talking to out here?

19:55.995 --> 19:58.963
A pretty awesome guy.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.031
Oh, "pretty awesome guy."

20:00.033 --> 20:01.365
Why don't you
marry him, huh?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.466
All right, game on.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.468
Aah!
(imitates crowd cheering)

20:04.470 --> 20:07.438
Stew-S-A.
Stew-S-A. Stew-S-A.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.048
Oven mitts.
Wow, thanks, Mom.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.649
Now you don't
have to ask me

20:18.651 --> 20:21.319
if everything is hot
before you touch it.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.355
Are... are
the oven mitts hot?

20:24.357 --> 20:27.225
Here you go, Stewie.
Merry Christmas.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.532
Brian, it's-it's...
wonderful. Thank you.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.834
Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.402
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.670
Brian.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.172
Are we pregnant?

20:41.174 --> 20:42.840
What? No, Stewie,
it's nothing like that.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.342
Okay, well, I
have to tell you,

20:44.344 --> 20:45.509
I'm a little
bit relieved.

20:45.511 --> 20:49.080
Look, just, just, thanks
for everything, Stewie.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.883
You're my best friend
and I love you.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.552
All I can say, Brian,
is you've been making
really creepy eye contact

20:54.554 --> 20:57.355
with me all morning
and I want it to
stop right now.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.623
