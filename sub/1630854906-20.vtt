WEBVTT

00:02.128 --> 00:04.255
[Stromberg] Yeah,
we're on day eight of the fallout.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.257
For an incident no one's
supposed to be talking about,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.634
it seems to be all anyone
is talking about with me.

00:08.718 --> 00:12.179
Mmm-hmm.
I have an 8:00 a.m. at the White House.

00:12.263 --> 00:14.390
POTUS and his damn progress reports.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.058
You know what, Walter,

00:16.142 --> 00:18.102
I already have an appointment
in my office,

00:18.185 --> 00:19.437
even this early.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.063
Their hackles seemed raised.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.399
I'd better see to 'em.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.068
Congressman Hudson, Agent Nixon,

00:26.152 --> 00:27.570
I wasn't kidding about that meeting

00:27.653 --> 00:29.238
with the President this morning.

00:29.321 --> 00:32.073
The pair of you have 90 seconds
of my time. Go.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.701
Well, sir, we're here about
an investigation

00:33.784 --> 00:36.579
I've been conducting into
a clandestine bureau task force.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.164
What began as my initial look into

00:38.247 --> 00:40.291
what I thought was
a misallocation of funds

00:40.374 --> 00:43.043
became a full-on scrutinization
of what I presumed

00:43.127 --> 00:44.545
was rogue leadership--

00:44.628 --> 00:48.632
Hudson, anyone ever tell you
not to use four words when two will do?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.635
Arthur brought to me what
looked like a rogue task force.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.679
It's gone deeper than that now.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.640
Task force 836. I'm aware of it.

00:57.183 --> 00:59.268
Something thrown together
by one of my predecessors.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.312
Showed decent results over the years.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.607
Frankly, the whole thing seems
generated above my pay grade.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.066
You're the Attorney General.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.027
[Stromberg] Gentlemen, it isn't rogue.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.862
It's sanctioned by good ol' Uncle Sam.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.947
Are we done here?

01:12.031 --> 01:14.200
Um...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.912
Did you know the criminal informant
supplying intelligence

01:17.995 --> 01:21.373
to that task force is Raymond Reddington?

01:21.457 --> 01:23.417
That's classified information.

01:24.126 --> 01:28.005
You seem to know more than
a congressman should, Mr. Hudson.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.425
Let me further educate you.
The US government works

01:31.509 --> 01:33.886
with criminal informants all the time.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.430
Sometimes life is
a little less Frank Capra

01:36.514 --> 01:38.223
than you seem to realize.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.683
How about we educate each other.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.935
That meeting you have with the President,

01:41.018 --> 01:42.603
would it have anything to do

01:42.686 --> 01:44.646
with the surveillance breach
at the Capitol Building last week

01:44.729 --> 01:47.358
that the entire intelligence community
is keeping under wraps?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.277
Jesus, Hudson.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.326
Okay, go on...

01:57.493 --> 02:00.830
That's a transcript of an authorized
Justice Department wiretap

02:00.913 --> 02:04.208
of an agent on Task Force 836.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.377
I have the full recordings
to back up all my findings.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.127
-I've heard them. They're legit.
-[Hudson] Mmm-hmm.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.631
Right now CIA, NSA, pick your initials,

02:10.714 --> 02:12.842
all think we only found out
about the breach at the Capitol

02:12.925 --> 02:15.261
because of 836 and their informant.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.763
But no one knows the whole story.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.974
General Stromberg, trust me,

02:20.057 --> 02:22.268
you really want to read this.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.645
Go on.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.146
What about your meeting
with the President?

02:26.230 --> 02:28.858
The President can wait.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.293
[Hawkins] Ah.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.338
Oh! [chuckles]

02:51.422 --> 02:53.716
Raymond, you scared me to death!

02:53.799 --> 02:55.009
Spring cleaning?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.760
I've been meaning to air out this place

02:56.844 --> 02:58.596
and declutter it for years.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.222
I know the feeling,

03:00.306 --> 03:02.224
airing out and decluttering.

03:02.308 --> 03:03.893
[Hawkins] So what are you doing here?

03:03.976 --> 03:06.437
I mean, you haven't tapped me
for much lately?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.106
You have something new for me?

03:09.189 --> 03:13.068
Heddie, it is still just
the two birds you own, right?

03:13.152 --> 03:14.320
Oh, these?

03:14.403 --> 03:15.738
I... I collect them.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.574
They're just for show, not for function.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.244
I've known a few people
in my life you could say that about.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.204
So you didn't answer my question.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.040
-Why the visit?
-Well, funny enough,

03:26.123 --> 03:29.627
I was going through
some boxes myself recently,

03:29.793 --> 03:33.172
seems spring is in the air for all of us,

03:33.255 --> 03:38.010
and I found something
I've had for you for quite awhile.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.513
[gasps] The bird sanctuary
in Costa Rica!

03:41.597 --> 03:43.849
I was the one who told you
to go down there, remember?

03:43.933 --> 03:48.603
I do. I finally swung by
during my time down in Guatemala

03:48.687 --> 03:52.608
and just loved the place,
and I knew you did, too.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.778
And, so, I went ahead and I bought it.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.322
Okay, you did what now?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.574
[Reddington] Well,
here's the pickle though.

04:00.658 --> 04:05.037
I make it down there
so rarely that, yesterday,

04:05.120 --> 04:08.082
I called an attorney
I know in San Jose

04:08.165 --> 04:11.251
and had the deed
transferred to your name.

04:11.335 --> 04:15.339
Congratulations.
I think you'll do wonders with it.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.341
Raymond...

04:18.425 --> 04:20.260
My God.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.847
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.641
Raymond, thank you.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.143
Thank you, Heddie. For everything.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.561
You know what?

04:29.645 --> 04:31.939
I'll give you a chance to repay me.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.357
[Hawkins] How could I ever?

04:33.440 --> 04:34.858
Buy me breakfast.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.737
There's a place up the street
that has the very best migas.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.572
And I love migas.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.951
I know that you do. [chuckles]

04:45.452 --> 04:47.913
So just what the hell do
we think Reddington's up to.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.456
[Siya] Let's step back.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.667
What's the actual extent
of what he's given up?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.711
Well, so far, a shipping empire

04:53.794 --> 04:55.671
and most of his intelligence network.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.340
-You know him best, Dembe.
-No one knows Raymond.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.633
Not really.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.093
I spent over 20 years by his side

05:01.176 --> 05:03.387
and never saw the full scope
of his operation.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.848
He was always the central
clearing house of it all,

05:05.931 --> 05:08.559
and the rest of us
were compartmentalized.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.060
[Ressler] Well, he's up to something.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.687
Reddington always has
a card up his sleeve,

05:11.770 --> 05:13.313
and we can't underestimate him.

05:13.397 --> 05:17.067
He's so streamlined now,
who knows what he's capable of?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.444
This is a fun game, you guys.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.987
It's like throwing darts, in the dark,

05:20.070 --> 05:21.447
on a train going off a cliff.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.949
But I have a question,
what does this mean for us?

05:24.033 --> 05:25.576
What do you mean?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.202
Well, for instance,
is there still a Blacklist?

05:27.369 --> 05:29.163
And if not, is there still a task force?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.123
I mean, I just got here, you know?

05:31.206 --> 05:33.417
And I finally got my desk
set up the way I like.

05:36.378 --> 05:40.090
Sadly, my status within the Bureau
was just provisional,

05:40.174 --> 05:42.342
so I need to report back to MI6

05:42.426 --> 05:44.344
if there's nothing more for me to do here.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.847
Now Siya has to go how?
This truly sucks.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.640
[Ressler] I'm telling you,
we need to be on high alert.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.268
-[cell phone chimes]
-This thing isn't over yet. Not for us.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.688
Definitely not for Reddington.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.194
Maybe we can find a way
to keep the band together?

06:00.277 --> 06:02.404
What do you suggest?
Rent a van?

06:02.488 --> 06:04.198
Drive around solving crimes?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.366
I'll be Fred if you'll be Velma.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.703
Raymond told me never
to repeat this,

06:09.787 --> 06:12.831
but what if I happen to know
where Jimmy Hoffa is buried?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.958
What?

06:18.587 --> 06:20.130
[woman] Agent Ressler, uh, hello.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.882
You and I haven't met,
but my name is Jill.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.550
I'm Jonathan Pritchard's wife.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.344
I got this number from Jon
a few months ago.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.888
He told me to reach out to you
in case of emergencies.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.765
I think this classifies as that.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.392
I haven't seen or heard
from him in over two days.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.311
I checked all our credit card statements,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.896
three ATM withdrawals and tabs

06:35.979 --> 06:37.981
at two different bars along K Street.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.567
All recent.
I think this is really bad.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.320
Please, call me back at this number
as soon as you can.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.740
[line rings]

06:46.824 --> 06:49.118
Right there, if you please.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.495
I'm amazed you have
the county clerk records

06:51.578 --> 06:53.247
going back to 1910.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.792
Yes, and I discovered
the building was briefly used

06:56.875 --> 07:02.047
as an infirmary during
the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.382
It's riveting stuff.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.300
The Conservation League
of New York State

07:05.384 --> 07:06.593
thanks you, Mr. Homan.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.513
And just a reminder,
we take ownership at the end of the month.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.099
Please make sure you treat her well,
Mr. Tine.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.309
She's a great piece of history.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.186
Can you find your way out?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.688
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.277
What was that all about?

07:23.360 --> 07:26.947
I wasn't expecting you for another hour.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.951
I was securing a qualified custodian

07:31.034 --> 07:33.871
for this little gem of a building.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.455
Raymond,

07:35.539 --> 07:39.918
if you give this place up,
where would you sleep?

07:40.002 --> 07:42.379
Oh, you know me.

07:42.462 --> 07:47.467
I can sleep anywhere,
in a hammock, under a tree,

07:47.551 --> 07:51.889
in a cave that I'd share
with a colony of bats.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.558
I'm off to chase the moon
across the world.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.519
That's why I asked you here.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.939
I want you to come with me,

08:01.023 --> 08:03.108
into the moonlight.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.736
Raymond, what are you doing?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.863
What is this all about?

08:07.946 --> 08:12.993
I guess it's about life being
a series of chapters,

08:13.076 --> 08:16.371
and this most recent one of mine

08:16.455 --> 08:21.084
maybe lasted a little longer
than it ever should have.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.966
Raymond,

08:28.050 --> 08:30.010
let's say I go with you.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.845
How would we make that work?

08:31.929 --> 08:33.263
Hmm?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.140
We're cut from the same cloth.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.602
We both understand each other.
We both love each other.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.770
But we're not going to change.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
We'd miss that pump of adrenaline,

08:46.109 --> 08:48.987
that feeling of peril.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.992
How many days before one of us
gets restless and moves on?

08:56.495 --> 08:59.373
I don't...
I don't have an answer to that.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.541
Maybe you should.

09:01.792 --> 09:07.631
Maybe it's time we both entered
a quieter, safer period in our lives.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.301
I have a job, working for Adolfo Santoro.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.971
-Remember?
-It's dangerous by his side.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.390
It's just as dangerous by yours.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.977
Then I'll make you a proposition.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.353
Raymond...

09:21.436 --> 09:23.480
I'm going to be at the jet later today.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.941
Meet me there.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.569
Edward and I will be
wheels up at 4:00 p.m.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.658
You don't have to make up
your mind right now.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.703
But if you're not there by 4:00,

09:37.786 --> 09:40.330
I'll know your decision.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.842
[knocking on door]

09:52.301 --> 09:54.303
Cynthia, I didn't know
you were stopping by today.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.388
Neither did I.
We've both been summoned

09:56.513 --> 09:58.432
to the office of the Attorney General.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.434
Stromberg? When?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.019
Now. This morning.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.687
I have a car out front for us.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.356
All right, let me, uh,
tell the team I'll be out for awhile.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.318
Harold, I've learned to dread
this question more than anything

10:09.401 --> 10:12.070
when I'm asking it to you.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.698
You have any idea what this is about?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.783
What are we walking into?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.702
Please close the door
and sit down, Cynthia.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.287
We need to talk.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.543
Mr. Pritchard's room is just down here.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.089
Hey, if you're here,

10:31.173 --> 10:33.050
and the FBI is looking for this dude...

10:33.133 --> 10:34.468
I should let my boss know, right?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.763
No, you should go back to doing
your job and let me do mine.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.390
[lock beeps and door unlocks]

10:44.186 --> 10:45.520
Jon?

10:45.604 --> 10:47.564
[sportscaster speaking
indistinctly on TV]

10:47.647 --> 10:48.648
[door closes]

11:17.344 --> 11:19.346
Hey. Rough morning, Pritch?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.765
I can't get the bubbles to work.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.226
Yeah, it's a damn shame.
Come on.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.775
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.820
Harold, this is insanity.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.196
The Capitol?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.240
I mean, I'd heard whispers around town

11:38.323 --> 11:39.908
like everyone else had this past week,

11:39.991 --> 11:42.911
some kind of data leak
they were keeping under wraps.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.330
It's a bit more complicated
than that, I'm afraid.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.915
And it wasn't just our government.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.918
I cringe to ask. Who else?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.795
We have evidence of surveillance programs,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.965
wiretapping, bugging ops
in major cities across Europe,

11:55.048 --> 11:57.092
Russia, Asia, the southern hemisphere.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.761
I could go on.
And it was Reddington?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.179
All of it?

12:01.263 --> 12:03.348
I could answer that question
for you Cynthia,

12:03.432 --> 12:05.892
but you don't really need me to,
now do you?

12:05.976 --> 12:09.396
Do you have any idea
what the fallout would be

12:09.479 --> 12:11.690
if anyone knew that
your CI was responsible

12:11.773 --> 12:14.901
for the greatest intelligence
breach in US history?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.903
In world history?

12:16.987 --> 12:18.989
I'm not sure that's ever going to happen.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.449
There's more.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.534
I don't know if I can handle more, Harold.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.619
I should check my systolic pressure first.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.955
[Cooper] It was Reddington himself
who directed us

12:27.038 --> 12:28.582
to the bugging operation at the Capitol

12:28.665 --> 12:31.209
that then led
to the dismantling of his entire network.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.669
Why would he do that?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.629
[Cooper] In all my years
with this task force

12:34.713 --> 12:36.089
and all my time with Reddington,

12:36.173 --> 12:38.300
I've never seen anything like this.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.051
It would seem that he's divesting

12:40.135 --> 12:41.887
or maybe he's just downsizing.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.847
But I don't know what that means
for the Blacklist.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.725
None of us are entirely sure
why he's doing what he's doing.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.643
But he's handing us
a lot of different keys

12:48.727 --> 12:51.354
to a lot of different locks,
and there's no playbook here.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.939
Has there ever been a playbook?

12:54.065 --> 12:56.943
I used to think that was part
of what made us successful.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.737
I'm not sure what to think anymore.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.448
But I can tell you with certainty
that room 417

13:01.531 --> 13:03.575
at the US Capitol,
along with rooms just like it

13:03.658 --> 13:06.870
across the world,
are no more and no longer.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.830
He shut them all down, Cynthia.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.917
Maybe there's a way
to keep this under control.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.710
We'll head to the AG's office,

13:13.793 --> 13:15.879
answer whatever questions he has,

13:15.962 --> 13:19.758
but as far as the United States
and any future grand jury is concerned,

13:19.841 --> 13:22.135
no one needs to know
that Raymond Reddington

13:22.219 --> 13:24.846
was responsible
for this intelligence breach.

13:24.930 --> 13:28.016
The two of us can take
that information with us to the grave.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.437
As long as we keep
Reddington's involvement quiet,

13:32.521 --> 13:34.523
I don't think anyone's grave
gets dug today.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.652
Mmm!

13:38.735 --> 13:40.570
I didn't think
you'd make ice cream day this week.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.364
Why ever would you think that?

13:42.447 --> 13:43.990
Because of work.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.660
I know you've been really busy.
Pops, too.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.372
Nothing is more important than you,
sweetheart, to me and Pops.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.415
Well, maybe one thing...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.335
No, Pinky! You picked peppermint stick.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.795
You're stuck with peppermint stick!

13:56.878 --> 13:58.547
Mmm! Wow!

13:58.630 --> 13:59.798
[laughs]

13:59.881 --> 14:02.592
I'm glad you got it.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.636
Actually, there is a reason that today

14:04.719 --> 14:08.932
is a special ice cream day.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.685
I have something for you.

14:11.768 --> 14:16.940
When she was about your age,
your mother made a promise to herself

14:17.023 --> 14:20.110
to achieve something important,

14:20.193 --> 14:24.155
something special in her life.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.908
And she grew up, and she did it.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.622
She carried this with pride,

14:32.706 --> 14:35.667
and now I want you to have it.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.961
Whatever you end up doing in your life,

14:38.044 --> 14:40.130
however high you reach,

14:40.213 --> 14:45.260
that will remind you of her effort
and determination.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.931
You have all the best parts
of her inside you.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.393
But maybe reach for something

14:53.476 --> 14:56.855
-a little more fun than law enforcement.
-[laughs]

14:59.816 --> 15:02.986
Pinky, are you going somewhere?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.946
I'd miss you.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.368
Well, I'm always traveling, sweetheart.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.829
But I'll never be too far.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.542
I'll always be right there.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.377
And right in here.

15:25.884 --> 15:29.220
[sportscaster speaking indistinctly on TV]

15:31.389 --> 15:32.807
[Ressler] This is what we're gonna do.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.352
We'll wait for you to sober up.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.146
Then, we're gonna get your ass to
the first meeting we can find, all right?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.191
I'm not going anywhere...
You don't tell me...

15:41.274 --> 15:42.567
It's all right.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.319
I know that's not you talking, Jon.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.279
That's the junk in your bloodstream.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.989
What did you take? Huh?

15:48.073 --> 15:49.949
Did you mix? Do you remember?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.743
He made me... He made me do it...

15:51.826 --> 15:53.912
We'll figure it out, pal, all right?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.372
...wrong about Don...

15:55.455 --> 15:57.374
He's... He's salt of the earth...

15:57.457 --> 16:00.585
Salt of the earth...
It's you phone... Your phone...

16:00.669 --> 16:02.754
My phone? What about my phone?

16:02.837 --> 16:05.173
They were listening...
I... I... They made me do it...

16:05.256 --> 16:07.133
Who made you do what?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.261
Hudson...

16:10.345 --> 16:12.222
Your phone...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.391
He's... He's listening, Don...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.559
I'm sorry.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.687
What are the odds we still have jobs

16:18.770 --> 16:20.355
on the other side of this meeting?

16:20.438 --> 16:22.982
If I get cornered,
I'm blaming everything on you.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.193
-[cell phone ringing]
-I'm going to take this.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.529
Head inside. I'll be right there.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.031
Who is this?

16:30.115 --> 16:31.908
It's Ressler. I can't talk long.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.160
-What number are you calling me from?
-A motel.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.371
I can't use my own phone.
But where are you right now?

16:36.454 --> 16:38.081
About to take a meeting
with the Attorney General.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.125
Listen to me.
That congressman, Hudson?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.209
What about him?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.002
I have reason to believe
that he's tapped my phone.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.754
That he's been listening to my calls.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.840
Maybe for awhile now.
But I can't be sure.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.091
He did what?

16:48.174 --> 16:49.217
How do you know this?

16:49.718 --> 16:53.096
Well, let's just call it a semi-reliable
source, but if it's true...

16:53.179 --> 16:54.931
There's no way Hudson
received authorization for that.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.891
Yeah, but if it is, sir,
just think about all the things

16:56.975 --> 16:59.477
that we've been talking about
over the phone in the last few weeks.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.230
If you're at the
Attorney General's office right now,

17:02.313 --> 17:03.982
you could be walking into a buzz saw.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.527
[Cooper on recording]
We stood by and offered him protection

17:07.609 --> 17:09.028
while he built out and strengthened

17:09.154 --> 17:10.363
a vast criminal network.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.281
We've protected him

17:12.365 --> 17:14.075
while he hardwired the US Capitol

17:14.159 --> 17:16.618
and intercepted
a decade's worth of state secrets.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.080
In a way, we've been
his partners in treason.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.753
Director Cooper, will you have a seat?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.761
[Siya] Well, it's some
seriously invasive software.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.804
We have no way of knowing
how long it's been there.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.639
But we used to use stuff
like this all the time

17:36.723 --> 17:38.349
when I was with MI6.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.393
Whatever it is, it treated
the encryption on your phone

17:40.477 --> 17:41.811
like a flimsy screen door.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.980
It's definitely government.
Maybe NSA?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.649
If they're right about this
and it is NSA equipment

17:46.733 --> 17:49.319
or something like that,
then Hudson had help.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.737
[Ressler] And it means he had a warrant.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.238
If he has a warrant,
he's been listening,

17:52.322 --> 17:55.283
he's heard us talk about the
Capitol Building and about Reddington.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.162
[Reddington] She can
be a little hard to read sometimes.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.247
She says we're alike, but am I like that?

18:01.331 --> 18:02.624
Am I hard to read?

18:02.707 --> 18:05.794
I just want her to at least
show up at the jet.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.046
You know?
Even if she doesn't want to come along,

18:08.129 --> 18:10.590
I just want to hear it from her.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.343
You know what I mean?
What do you think, Teddy?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.845
I barely know this woman.
But I gotta tell ya,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.889
I've been married to my wife for 42 years.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.183
I love her with all my heart.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.477
And if it was my plane,
I'd take off early.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.312
Oh, my God. Fine.
You know what?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.898
Romance clearly is not your area
of expertise.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.817
[Brimley] Doesn't sound
like yours either.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.527
So, you're going traveling.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.779
-When do you think you'll be back?
-[Reddington] I don't know.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.656
I haven't really
given it much thought, actually.

18:34.739 --> 18:35.907
Know what I think?

18:35.990 --> 18:37.659
I think I need to find a new job.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.828
You don't need a job.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.081
You've saved every dollar,
millions of them.

18:43.164 --> 18:47.085
You've got your lake here,
the rods and the reels.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.587
-You have your family.
-Exactly.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.714
I gotta get out of the house, move around,

18:51.798 --> 18:53.466
attach jumper cables to someone.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.094
That is all behind us, Teddy.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.097
Find a new hobby, a new passion.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.809
I don't know, something that involves
less screaming, at least.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.230
You remember Smokey
and that dog grooming business we had?

19:07.313 --> 19:11.067
He did such a crackerjack job
of promoting that place.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.236
What about something like that for you?

19:13.319 --> 19:16.531
Animals? What the hell
do I know about animals?

19:16.614 --> 19:17.699
Oh, you're right.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.367
Wherever would I have gotten that idea?

19:20.076 --> 19:23.746
All I'm saying, Teddy,
animals shed their fur,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.832
reptiles shed their skin.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.335
Don't be afraid to become
something new. I'm not.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.212
You didn't use to be this much
of a fortune cookie,

19:31.296 --> 19:32.380
-you know?
-[cell phone rings]

19:32.463 --> 19:37.093
Or was I always,
and now I'm just a sweeter kind of cookie?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.803
Dembe, what a nice surprise.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.263
Hey, send my regards.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.890
[Reddington] Teddy sends his best.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.350
Donald's phone was bugged
the last week or two.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.977
There's no telling what was heard.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.395
Bugged? By whom?

19:47.478 --> 19:48.646
That congressman...

19:48.730 --> 19:50.398
Ah, Mr. Hudson.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.734
He's like a dog with a squeaky toy.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.652
Drives you crazy, and he won't give it up.

19:54.736 --> 19:55.945
Cooper was called

19:56.029 --> 19:57.572
to a meeting with
the Attorney General today.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.990
He's there now.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.326
-We think--
-Hudson's leading the charge?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.161
Yes, I do, too.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.121
Thank you, Dembe.
Keep me posted.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.040
-Raym--
-[beeps]

20:09.042 --> 20:12.503
That is your voice on
the recording Director Cooper?

20:12.587 --> 20:13.671
Yes, it is, sir.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.758
A scandal like this would stain

20:16.841 --> 20:19.218
the very foundation of our country.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.720
So how do we proceed?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.263
[Hudson] I'll ask the first question.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.849
Director Cooper, uh,
at what point did you know

20:24.933 --> 20:26.935
for certain you were
collaborating high treason

20:27.018 --> 20:28.144
against the United States?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.562
Hold on one minute!

20:29.646 --> 20:31.147
I'm sitting here listening to you all

20:31.230 --> 20:33.900
make accusations
against Harold Cooper,

20:33.983 --> 20:37.737
my friend and colleague
who is a patriot to his core.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.490
What you are choosing
to conveniently omit,

20:40.573 --> 20:42.784
Mr. Hudson, are all the accomplishments

20:42.867 --> 20:45.036
this task force has made
due to actionable intel

20:45.119 --> 20:46.704
provided by Raymond Reddington.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.040
As much as one might want to sit here

20:49.123 --> 20:51.709
and believe the defense
of a sitting senator

20:51.793 --> 20:53.127
and an FBI director,

20:53.211 --> 20:56.381
it is my finding that Task Force 836

20:56.464 --> 20:58.257
has reached a point
where they are no longer

20:58.341 --> 21:02.428
working with Raymond Reddington,
but rather for Reddington.

21:02.512 --> 21:06.724
I truly believe you don't know
which way is up anymore.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.441
You know,
I've sat in so many of these rooms,

21:15.525 --> 21:18.528
answered so many of these questions.

21:18.861 --> 21:22.156
The revolving door of people asking,

21:22.240 --> 21:24.701
people wagging fingers, pointing fingers,

21:25.410 --> 21:27.954
the people change,
but the questions stay the same.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.916
The carpet stays the same.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.128
I stay the same.
And you know what?

21:35.211 --> 21:39.132
I... I don't have an excuse left in me.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.842
I'm tired.

21:41.676 --> 21:44.762
I was a caretaker, a night watchman,

21:44.846 --> 21:48.224
to a cause that kept
this world a little safer.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.853
It was in danger yesterday.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.646
It'll be in danger tomorrow.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.734
The best I could do
was look after it with the bit of time

21:57.817 --> 21:59.736
I was given.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.448
I can't justify the actions
of my team any longer

22:03.531 --> 22:06.534
to the very people
who sanctioned that team to begin with.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.413
We did our best to look after
the charter we were given.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.540
And I can sleep at night.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.460
If you want my badge,

22:15.585 --> 22:18.212
take my badge.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.506
I'm done apologizing.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.053
[static buzzes]

22:25.136 --> 22:27.430
[Reddington] Hello? Hello?

22:27.513 --> 22:28.931
Is it working?

22:30.099 --> 22:32.310
Y... Okay. [chuckles]

22:32.393 --> 22:34.145
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.606
I hate to barge in like this.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.649
But may I speak for just a moment?

22:38.733 --> 22:42.945
Because there's a perspective
you may not have considered.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.906
-Mine.
-[Hudson] I don't believe this.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.699
This is exactly
what I've been talking about.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.534
This man has pirated himself

22:48.618 --> 22:50.328
into a closed-door meeting
with the Attorney General.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.080
-He's out of control.
-[Reddington] Forgive me.

22:52.163 --> 22:55.374
You all can see me, but I can't see you.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.210
Wh-Who is speaking?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.961
Arthur Hudson,
Mr. Reddington.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.505
And it's clear to me by this intrusion

23:00.588 --> 23:03.299
that you have more power than
any confidential informant ever should.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.675
It's funny.

23:04.759 --> 23:08.179
It seems you have more power
than a congressman should.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.516
How is it exactly
that you've anointed yourself

23:11.599 --> 23:16.521
the Inspector General of
a clandestine FBI task force?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.356
Someone has to stand in your way.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.066
[chuckles]

23:20.149 --> 23:23.736
Congressman, your conflict is with me,
not the FBI.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.947
Everything we're discussing here,

23:26.030 --> 23:28.574
the ongoing criminal enterprise,

23:28.658 --> 23:32.578
the invasive tactics
taken at the Capitol, it's all me.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.497
You need to redirect your fight.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.040
I need to put you behind bars.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.292
I've been, several times.
It didn't take.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.877
Gentlemen, enough!

23:39.961 --> 23:41.921
I would like to see the results

23:42.004 --> 23:44.006
836 has provided
over the years.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.883
Let's review the case files.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.468
About that.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.220
In the spirit of full-disclosure,

23:49.303 --> 23:51.347
I had every mention of my name deleted

23:51.430 --> 23:54.350
from those files several months ago, so...

23:54.433 --> 23:56.352
Otherwise, they're an exciting read.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.896
Do you see? Do you see
the mockery he's made of all this?

23:58.980 --> 24:00.731
I honestly can't believe what I'm hearing.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.316
I have to agree with Hudson here.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.610
Unless someone can convince me otherwise,

24:04.694 --> 24:06.487
I see this informant relationship

24:06.571 --> 24:07.947
as a bureaucratic failure.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.949
That's a bit myopic, don't you think?

24:10.032 --> 24:13.077
How else am I supposed
to see your actions

24:13.161 --> 24:14.745
in regards to the Capitol

24:14.829 --> 24:16.914
as anything other than high treason?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.834
You call it whatever the hell you want.
That's fine by me.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.587
But leave Harold Cooper
and his people out of it.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.839
They don't know the breadth
of my operation.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.924
Not a tenth of it, not a hundredth.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.676
Even what we've touched on today

24:28.759 --> 24:32.555
is nominal to what I have
set up around the world.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.267
I have more bugs in more rooms
than your prosaic little mind

24:36.350 --> 24:37.643
could possibly imagine.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.604
I've forgotten more about

24:39.687 --> 24:41.606
surveillance and black bag ops

24:41.689 --> 24:44.525
than you could ever teach
in every classroom

24:44.609 --> 24:46.694
in Langley and Quantico.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.572
But you know what's truly inarguable?

24:49.655 --> 24:52.950
Harold Cooper and his team have lost

24:53.034 --> 24:57.079
and sacrificed, given their lives,

24:57.163 --> 25:01.209
and still delivered to you
time and time again.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.794
You want to blame someone, blame yourself

25:03.878 --> 25:05.546
and the others who proceeded you.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.423
Because you want your information

25:07.506 --> 25:08.799
from Raymond Reddington.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.593
You want to solve cases.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.178
You want to save lives.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.138
You want to have an effect.

25:14.222 --> 25:16.891
But you don't want to be guilty
of doing business with me,

25:16.974 --> 25:18.559
not in the harsh light of day.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.102
Well, shame on you.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.396
I am what I am.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.065
You made a devil's bargain.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.735
Did you really expect me
to stop being the devil?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.697
You know what?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.912
-You know what I think?
-Nor do I care.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.873
May I have a moment to think,

25:40.957 --> 25:42.625
please?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.016
What's going on, boss?

26:03.729 --> 26:07.942
As of this moment,
Task Force 836 has been shut down.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.987
It no longer exists.

26:13.114 --> 26:16.409
We always wondered
when this day might come.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.911
When we would be
held to account for everything

26:18.995 --> 26:21.455
we've done with Reddington.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.708
That day is today.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.251
[sighs]

26:25.334 --> 26:27.503
From this moment on,
I encourage all of you

26:27.586 --> 26:30.047
to be candid and forthright
in your answers.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.590
What answers?

26:31.799 --> 26:32.883
To what? To whom?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.888
Everyone, I need all personnel
to step aside,

26:37.972 --> 26:39.557
relinquish your cell phones

26:39.640 --> 26:41.559
and your computers
for a full audit of this site.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.810
What the hell is this?

26:42.893 --> 26:44.520
What he means is don't touch anything.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.771
And keep your hands
where we can see them.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.150
We're in charge here.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.776
[Nixon] None of you
are under arrest... yet.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.195
But I expect your full cooperation
from here on out.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.323
So what, we're being punished
for spending a decade doing our jobs?

27:37.948 --> 27:40.284
-What is he doing here?
-[Siya] My question exactly.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.328
This is a classified installation.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.373
The AG asked Congressman Hudson
to observe this investigation.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.375
Why? So he doesn't blab to the press.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.251
Ooh, the government keeps secrets.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.087
Let me collect my jaw
off the floor for that one.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.630
Cool it with the mouth, Hambright.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.924
The Congressman is here just to monitor.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.510
I'm the authority on this site
until we complete our objective.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.928
And what is your objective?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.930
We're here to locate
and arrest the criminal,

28:01.013 --> 28:02.306
Raymond Reddington.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.808
What my team needs from all of you

28:03.891 --> 28:05.518
is a list of known
Reddington safe houses,

28:05.601 --> 28:08.771
modes of transportation,
resources, aliases,

28:08.854 --> 28:10.481
associates, anything and everything.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.901
You think we have even
a fraction of that information?

28:13.984 --> 28:15.486
Then give us what you do have.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.155
[Nixon] Look, I'm not here
to butt heads with anyone.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.490
I just want to get my job done.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.242
And your support is the best chance

28:21.325 --> 28:22.952
we have of intercepting Reddington

28:23.035 --> 28:24.703
before he leaves the country,

28:24.787 --> 28:27.915
and bringing him to justice
safely and without incident.

28:27.998 --> 28:31.877
Raymond Reddington doesn't
do anything without incident.

28:31.961 --> 28:35.172
What is your operational status
with this task force?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.883
It was meant to be temporary.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.553
I sort of hung round.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.638
Was that to continue
your work with Reddington?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.140
It was to continue my work

28:44.223 --> 28:46.434
with all these people
you're interrogating.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.060
[Nixon] You worked for Reddington.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.645
For years.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.814
How did you even get a job
at the Bureau?

28:51.897 --> 28:54.483
I applied for it. I had an interview.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.901
And they hired me.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.361
Have you ever knowingly witnessed

28:57.445 --> 28:59.447
Raymond Reddington commit a crime?

28:59.864 --> 29:01.323
Are you for real?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.160
[cell phone buzzing]

29:11.834 --> 29:14.670
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but I really need to leave by 4:00.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.507
Do you have any idea
the kind of mess you're in?

29:18.591 --> 29:21.343
Do you have any idea
the mess I'll be in if I lose the sitter?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.763
Any other questions?

29:24.847 --> 29:26.557
Yeah, one. If you'd known what

29:26.640 --> 29:28.601
Reddington was up to
at the Capitol Building

29:28.684 --> 29:31.353
before he led you there,
would you have stopped him?

29:31.854 --> 29:34.607
My oath is to this country,
not to Raymond Reddington.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.443
So, that's a yes?
You would have stopped it?

29:37.526 --> 29:39.111
If I had to rip out every camera

29:39.195 --> 29:40.988
and microphone by hand myself.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.202
Mind explaining this?

29:46.285 --> 29:49.747
Can you tell me what you were
doing on this private plane?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.999
Eating snacks and watching movies.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.335
Enough games.
Whose plane was it?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.308
I heard from headquarters.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.018
The signal Reddington used
to remote access

30:11.101 --> 30:12.645
Stromberg's office earlier was traced

30:12.728 --> 30:15.564
to a 20-square-mile radius near
Deep Creek Lake in Maryland.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.358
They couldn't narrow it down
any further for us.

30:17.441 --> 30:18.692
[Hudson] We can work with that.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.319
I had your man here enhance this photo.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.446
We got a clear view of the tail number.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.240
I think that's Reddington's plane

30:24.323 --> 30:25.574
and I want its transponder beacon.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.243
We know he was in Maryland, right?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.036
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Hudson] Can't be that far.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.038
If he goes anywhere near that plane,
I want him.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.082
He cannot leave US airspace.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.751
Excuse me, Agent...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.044
It's Ishwood, sir.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.547
Agent Ishwood,
I have to use the restroom.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.131
I'm sure I need an escort.

30:42.091 --> 30:44.885
Yeah, sure. I'll take you.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.433
Strange day, huh?
Babysitting other Feds?

30:51.517 --> 30:53.852
Between you and me?
Not what I thought

30:53.936 --> 30:56.855
I'd be doing
when I woke up this morning.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.482
No hard feelings.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.234
You all seem like good agents.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.361
You're just doing your job.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.372
[line rings and clicks]

31:13.455 --> 31:15.374
They are onto the plane.
They are onto you.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.210
If you're not already gone,
please, get out now.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.649
[Nixon] We located that
transponder you were after.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.319
The plane is sitting on a runway
at Brawer County Airfield.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.322
It's a private, rural airstrip
between DC and Deep Creek Lake

31:46.405 --> 31:48.282
where we triangulated
Reddington's video signal.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.409
I've got the airfield administrator
on hold right now.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.286
The jet matches the tail number
you found,

31:52.369 --> 31:53.871
and it just finished fueling up.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.331
That jet could be wheels up at any minute.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.082
-We need to be there now.
-Yeah, way ahead of you.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.959
-Brawer, you still with me?
-[man] I'm here.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.170
I've just grounded all outbound
air traffic on our runway.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.047
Excellent.
Continue to refuse clearance

32:03.130 --> 32:04.590
to anyone requesting to take off,

32:04.673 --> 32:07.009
but do not approach
the aircraft yourself.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.762
We have HRT en route to you now.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.347
-Ishwood?
-Yes, sir.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.307
You stay behind, keep an eye
on all our friends here.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.100
-Don't let them touch anything.
-[Ishwood] Yes, sir.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.061
-What about me?
-You stay, too.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.271
You're not a field agent,
no matter how much you want to be.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.898
We'll keep you apprised
of anything that happens.

32:20.981 --> 32:21.982
Yeah.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.406
[Edward] Sir, I'm being told
by the tower here

32:29.490 --> 32:31.825
that we're grounded.
I believe something is going on.

32:31.909 --> 32:34.787
Then they found the beacon.
That was to be expected.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.705
Should we take off anyway?

32:36.789 --> 32:38.624
[sighs]

32:38.707 --> 32:40.501
Let's just wait a few more minutes.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.711
[Edward] Sir,
it's my advice that we take off.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.839
It's too risky to continue
sitting here exposed.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.343
I guess she's not coming.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.178
All right, Edward, you know what to do.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.763
Let's go.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.643
[sirens wailing]

33:09.988 --> 33:12.533
Hudson, the plane's already in the air.
We missed him.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.785
We're not out of the game.
We've got the transponder.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.579
We can track it.
That plane can't fly forever.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.540
It has to land somewhere for fuel.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.418
[Nixon] I'll put our airports within
a 3,000 mile radius on alert.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.253
And we'll scramble up a couple of jets.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.797
-Is that something we can do?
-You bet your ass we can.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.341
The minute Reddington touches
the ground, we'll have him.

33:29.425 --> 33:32.511
[exploding]

33:32.594 --> 33:35.305
Oh, my God.

33:35.389 --> 33:38.267
It's Reddington's jet.
There's been an explosion.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.185
The jet's going down.

33:40.269 --> 33:43.272
It's going to crash
in the wooded area behind the runway.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.274
No. No. No way.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.109
Y-You've got to get
over there and see.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.153
Over there? It's an active crash site.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.612
I can see smoke, Hudson.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.656
And I want to see a body.
Do you hear me?

33:52.740 --> 33:55.117
I want to know
Raymond Reddington's dead.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.077
Have some respect.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.495
Reddington wasn't alone.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.497
There was a pilot on that plane.

34:00.581 --> 34:02.374
These are human beings
we're talking about.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.502
[scoffs]

34:15.721 --> 34:17.681
I love the fact that you kept me waiting.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.058
I do. You never want to show
your hand too early.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.101
But 20 minutes late, Weecha?

34:22.186 --> 34:25.731
I had to know you'd stick around
and wait for me.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.192
What would you have done
had I not shown up to rescue you?

34:28.275 --> 34:31.027
The same thing.
I've had that jet rigged for years.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.489
You're telling me,
every time I road on that thing,

34:34.572 --> 34:36.033
there were explosives planted onboard?

34:36.116 --> 34:37.367
Every time.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.995
Fortunately, Edward's an excellent pilot.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.206
-Speaking of...
-[rock music playing]

34:42.289 --> 34:44.958
Oh, yeah

34:45.042 --> 34:47.335
You may want to pop the trunk.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.513
There's a party

34:57.596 --> 34:59.681
Edward! Unscathed!

34:59.765 --> 35:01.475
-Well done.
-Thank you, sir.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.852
That was quite exhilarating.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.564
They've got rhythm
A little blues

35:43.851 --> 35:47.187
[Stromberg] How much
have you been told since the plane crash?

35:47.271 --> 35:48.397
Very little.

35:49.231 --> 35:51.358
The crash site was located.

35:51.608 --> 35:52.943
But there were no bodies found.

35:53.694 --> 35:57.281
Which means Reddington
was not on board.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.366
Which means he's still out there.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.712
You wouldn't have anything to drink
in here, would you, Harold?

36:17.718 --> 36:20.387
Pour me a finger, and I'm going to
tell you what the deal is.

36:30.439 --> 36:31.773
[inhaling]

36:31.857 --> 36:34.526
Yes, sir, that's the medicine.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.242
I'm not here to break balls.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.744
We're two old men.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.495
We don't have the time
or the patience.

36:45.579 --> 36:49.791
And forget about the pageant
in my office earlier today.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.002
[clears throat]

36:53.462 --> 36:57.799
I am putting Task Force 836
back on the case.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.427
You'll help track down Reddington.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.054
No one knows him like you do.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.848
I believe you and your team
are good agents

37:04.932 --> 37:07.726
who found themselves
in an impossible situation.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.062
But good agents nonetheless.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.189
Now I want you to prove that to me.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.441
What about the Congressman?

37:14.524 --> 37:17.694
[sighs] Hudson is a Boy Scout.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.988
He doesn't have the discretion
or the caution

37:20.072 --> 37:21.156
for something like this.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.033
And besides, I gave Hudson
and Nixon their chance

37:23.116 --> 37:24.743
and now we've got plane wreckage

37:24.826 --> 37:28.121
scattered across a field in Maryland.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.540
I want this done quietly.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.877
And your people specialize in quiet.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.379
What do you say?

37:35.837 --> 37:38.090
I'm not sure I'm being given
a choice in the matter.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.633
I didn't set up this task force.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.636
I don't particularly care
about this task force.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.137
But I won't have a scandal.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.348
Someone's gonna take the fall for it.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.808
It won't be me.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.685
It can either be you and your team,

37:49.768 --> 37:51.353
or it can be Reddington.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.692
You care about your team, don't you?

37:59.403 --> 38:00.487
They're family.

38:07.869 --> 38:12.040
I'm gonna go give Hudson some decaf

38:12.124 --> 38:13.625
and buy you an inch of latitude.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.962
You go out there,
find your man, and bring him in.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.215
Or I will recommend full prosecutions

38:20.298 --> 38:22.968
for every member of your team.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.095
I don't want to.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.888
But my hands are tied.

38:28.515 --> 38:32.686
[man singing] Rising from the shadows

38:35.439 --> 38:36.857
Deep within...

38:36.940 --> 38:39.735
I can't believe Stromberg
is putting these people

38:39.818 --> 38:41.903
back in their posts.
What is he thinking?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.321
About results.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.781
You know what you do
when you're fighting

38:44.865 --> 38:46.366
an out-of-control wildfire?

38:46.450 --> 38:49.453
You set smaller fires.
Suck away its oxygen.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.246
You let mayhem deal with mayhem.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.498
These people are thick as thieves.

38:53.582 --> 38:54.833
Someone warned Reddington.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.460
They should all be in Federal custody.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.004
Well, Stromberg has the last word
and you heard him.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.589
We stand down.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.216
I'm not gonna rest until I know
who tipped that bastard off.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.261
Yeah. I don't trust them either.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.473
So we stand down and let them
bring in Reddington.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.558
Or they try to help him,

39:11.641 --> 39:13.101
and we bring them all in.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.857
This could be the end of days

39:21.651 --> 39:23.779
[Pritchard] Hey, Don, it's me.
I need your help.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.363
Please, Don. I'm sorry.

39:25.447 --> 39:26.990
I don't know if I can hold on alone.

39:28.325 --> 39:33.038
The darkness will rise

39:34.915 --> 39:36.833
So hold back the night

39:36.917 --> 39:38.210
Jon?

39:42.506 --> 39:49.054
The darkness will rise

39:49.137 --> 39:52.641
So hold back the night

39:52.766 --> 39:55.560
Hold back the night with me

39:55.644 --> 39:57.229
[over phone] Harold, it's Cynthia.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.106
I don't know when you'll
get this message.

39:59.189 --> 40:01.441
I'm not sure what the status
of your team will be

40:01.525 --> 40:03.944
when you finally do. [sighs]

40:04.027 --> 40:06.404
I meant every word of what I said today.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.740
Working with you,
working with your people,

40:08.824 --> 40:10.784
accomplishing what we have
these last years,

40:10.867 --> 40:12.869
has been the honor of my life.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.122
You're more than just a night watchman.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.916
You're a good man.
And this might seem small,

40:17.999 --> 40:20.377
but it always made me feel safer

40:20.460 --> 40:22.045
knowing you were out there,

40:22.129 --> 40:24.089
looking out for all of us.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.549
Talk soon.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.926
[Reddington] It's late, Harold.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.762
Almost first light out there.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.599
I thought you'd be long gone.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.561
You're my last stop of the day.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.902
Let me guess, they told you
to find me and bring me in,

40:45.986 --> 40:47.320
or else.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.322
[Cooper] They were slightly
more specific than that.

40:49.406 --> 40:52.492
The word "prosecution"
came up quite a few times.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.202
Technically, an agent named Nixon
is in charge,

40:54.286 --> 40:56.121
but it's all hands on deck.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.956
Whose head is on the block?

40:58.039 --> 40:59.958
All of ours.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.793
Or just yours.

41:02.544 --> 41:05.297
It was when I called
the Attorney General prosaic, wasn't it?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.631
I got a little carried away.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.095
Don't look so glum.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.431
It's just cops and robbers, Harold.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.892
Always has been all these years.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.602
I'm just glad you're the cop.

41:19.644 --> 41:23.190
I hope Donald's still on the chase,
for old times' sake.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.151
Let's have a little fun on the way out.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.694
What would you have me do?

41:28.695 --> 41:30.197
Catch me if you can.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.659
Vaya con dios, my friend.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.494
[light switch clicks]

41:36.578 --> 41:38.747
[Agnes] Pops? Is that you?

41:38.830 --> 41:41.082
Just a minute.
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.214
[door creaks]
