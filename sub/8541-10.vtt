[sighs]

10:37.549 --> 10:39.551
HE SHOULD BE UP HERE, NOT ME.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.815
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST ALL TRYING
TO MOVE AHEAD HERE.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.513
IT'S WHAT HE'D WANT.WERE YOU CLOSE WITH THE VICTIM?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.863
YES, I WAS. UM, WE ALL WERE--

10:46.863 --> 10:49.431
LIAR!

10:49.431 --> 10:51.389
YOU HATED BENJAMIN.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.566
YOU WERE TRYING
TO KICK HIM OUT OF OFFICE.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.395
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.AND YOU ARE?

10:57.395 --> 10:59.615
TONY.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.573
AND THAT MAN HAD A VENDETTA
AGAINST BENJAMIN

11:01.573 --> 11:03.575
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO OPEN OUR DOORS

11:03.575 --> 11:05.795
TO SANTAS OF ALL RACES,
CREEDS, AND COLORS.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.710
WHICHWILL NEVER HAPPEN.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.495
[murmuring]

11:10.495 --> 11:13.281
LOOK, IF SANTA ISN'T WHITE,
MALE, AND CHRISTIAN,

11:13.281 --> 11:17.328
THEN WHAT THE HECK IS HE?HE'S EVERYONE. HE'S THE SPIRIT
OF GENEROSITY IN ALL OF US.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.417
HE'S THE--OH, WOULD YOU BE QUIET,
YOU DUMB HIPPIE?

11:19.417 --> 11:22.159
[object clatters]HEY! HEY! OKAY, LET'S JUST--

11:22.159 --> 11:24.248
LET'S JUST GO FOR
A LITTLE DRIVE, SHALL WE?

11:24.248 --> 11:27.599
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
JUST... CARRY ON.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.994
[instrumental "Santa Claus

11:30.994 --> 11:33.083
HAPPY HANUKKAH. [sighs]

11:33.083 --> 11:34.476
FELIZ NAVIDAD.

11:44.442 --> 11:48.795
WHERE'S PATRICK JANE?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.405
IN THE FIELD.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.800
[sighs] THAT'S INCONVENIENT.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.501
I'M SORRY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.068
YES.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.766
JANE IS THE LEAD SUSPECT
IN MY INVESTIGATION,

12:03.766 --> 12:06.160
AND I CAN'T FIND HIM.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.162
JANE'S YOUR LEAD SUSPECT?

12:08.162 --> 12:12.079
YOU SMILE.

12:12.079 --> 12:15.386
YOU THINK HE'S NOT
CAPABLE OF MURDER?

12:15.386 --> 12:18.563
HE'S CAPABLE.
I'M SMILING BECAUSE

12:18.563 --> 12:21.131
IT'S AN ABSURD IDEA,
JANE KILLING JOHNSON.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.264
HE CAUGHT HIM.
HE PUT HIM IN THAT CELL.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.136
HE WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HIM ALIVE IN THAT CELL.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.225
AND I WAS NEXT TO LAST.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.706
LOOK, JOHNSON ASKED
TO SPEAK WITH JANE.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.448
HE SAID HE HAD A SECRET
HE WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE ELSE.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.364
[pen clicks]JANE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM.
I MADE HIM GO.

12:36.364 --> 12:39.236
THE GUY WAS ON FIRE
WHEN HE OPENED THE CELL DOOR.

12:39.236 --> 12:42.544
WHY WOULD JANE KILL HIM?

12:42.544 --> 12:45.068
THAT'S WHAT I SHALL ASK HIM...[pen clicks]

12:45.068 --> 12:46.417
WHEN I FIND HIM.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.245
[cell phone rings]

12:48.245 --> 12:50.813
HEY, LISBON.Uh, LaRoche is looking
for you.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.903
OH. WISH HIM LUCK.JANE, YOU DON'T
WANT TO RILE THIS ONE UP.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.644
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
COME IN.

12:55.644 --> 12:59.169
Uh, did you track down Ripple's
alcohol recovery group?

12:59.169 --> 13:01.519
WELL, I THINK I FOUND
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.999
GOTTA GO!

13:02.999 --> 13:05.001
[cell phone snaps shut]

13:05.001 --> 13:08.483
[waves splash]

13:08.483 --> 13:09.745
[clicking]

13:09.745 --> 13:11.791
HEY, VIRGIL.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.141
PATRICK.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.099
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:16.099 --> 13:19.102
YOUR OLD ASSISTANT
TOLD ME WHERE TO FIND YOU.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.191
I NEED YOUR HELP.WELL, THAT'S A TWIST.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.976
YOU NEVER NEEDED MY HELP
WHEN I WAS YOUR BOSS.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.456
WHAT HELP COULD I BE NOW?

13:25.456 --> 13:28.677
A COP-KILLER BURNED ALIVE
IN CBI CUSTODY.I HEARD.

13:28.677 --> 13:32.028
LISTEN, IF IT'S ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THAT, I DON'T WANT TO--

13:32.028 --> 13:35.162
WHOEVER SET THE FIRE
WORKS FOR RED JOHN.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.554
JANE...

13:36.554 --> 13:39.906
HE WAS A MEMBER
OF RED JOHN'S NETWORK.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.343
AND ANOTHER MEMBER
OF HIS NETWORK

13:42.343 --> 13:44.388
KILLED HIM TO STOP HIM
FROM TALKING.

13:44.388 --> 13:48.915
BUT HERE'S THE THING--RED JOHN
DOESN'T KNOW I KNOW THAT.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.004
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.962
YOU SOUND NUTS,
MY FRIEND. [laughs]

13:52.962 --> 13:56.487
NO, TH-THIS IS REAL.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.185
IF I CAN FIND WHO KILLED
TODD JOHNSON,

13:58.185 --> 14:00.187
I CAN TRACE THEM BACK
TO RED JOHN.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.450
I NEED
LaROCHE'S SUSPECT LIST,

14:02.450 --> 14:05.714
WHICH YOU, WITH ALL
YOUR BACK-CHANNEL CONTACTS,

14:05.714 --> 14:07.759
CAN GET ME.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.980
WHAT DOES LISBON
THINK OF YOUR THEORY?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.374
I CAN'T TELL HER.
THAT'D PUT HER AT RISK.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.897
OF COURSE.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.420
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.641
YOU'RE A BRAVE OLD MAN
WITH NOTHING TO LOSE.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.556
NOT SO BRAVE.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.514
NOT SO OLD.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.430
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WILL YOU HELP ME?

14:26.430 --> 14:29.564
[sighs] YOU NEED
A DIFFERENT KIND OF HELP.

14:29.564 --> 14:33.437
RED JOHN HAS TURNED YOU INTO
A PARANOID CONSPIRACY FREAK.

14:33.437 --> 14:37.354
THIS FROM A GUY ON A PIER WITH 2
40s UNDER HIS CHAIR

14:37.354 --> 14:39.139
AND NO FISH IN HIS BUCKET?

14:39.139 --> 14:41.968
YOU'RE NOT EVEN USING
THE RIGHT BAIT.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.404
AM SO.[clicking]

14:43.404 --> 14:45.406
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU CATCH ONE?

14:45.406 --> 14:48.017
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND
OF FISH IT IS.NO.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.541
WHEN YOU CATCH ONE,
NO MATTER WHAT KIND IT IS,

14:50.541 --> 14:52.848
YOU WILL STOP
AND YOU WILL LOOK AT IT,

14:52.848 --> 14:55.982
AT THIS PIECE OF LIFE
THAT YOU DESTROYED,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.984
AND YOU WILL THINK
TO YOURSELF,

14:57.984 --> 15:00.551
"WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE,
A DRUNKEN FISH-KILLER,

15:00.551 --> 15:02.814
WHEN I COULD BE DOING
SOMETHING USEFUL?"

15:02.814 --> 15:05.339
AND THEN YOU'LL CALL ME.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.224
YOU, WITH THE GRUDGE,
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

15:21.224 --> 15:23.400
[sighs] HAVING SOME DRINKS
WITH THE GUYS.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.752
THEY WERE PLOTTING WAYS TO
REPLACE BENJAMIN AS PRESIDENT.HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.363
IS IT TRUE?

15:29.363 --> 15:32.105
LOOK, I'M HEAD
OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.282
BENJAMIN WAS USING
OUR SOCIETY AS A PLATFORM

15:35.282 --> 15:37.197
TO PROMOTE
HIS ONLINE BUSINESS.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.417
AND HOW'D YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

15:40.417 --> 15:43.290
I WAS SITTING TWO STOOLS AWAY
AT THE HOTEL BAR.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.336
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS
WITHOUT THE BEARD.OH, GEE, A SPY!

15:46.336 --> 15:48.904
A CONCERNED MEMBER
OF THE N.S.A.S.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.863
THEY WERE TRYING TO TAKE OVER
HIS POSITION.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.779
AND THEY WERE DROOLING
OVER HIS DATE.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.913
THE VICTIM HAD A DATE
AT THE BAR?NO, AT THE OPENING NIGHT MIXER.

15:57.913 --> 16:01.830
AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN.YOU CALLED HER
HIS HO-HO-HO.

16:01.830 --> 16:05.051
OH, COME ON. YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THAT BENJAMIN DIDN'T PAY FOR HER

16:05.051 --> 16:07.444
WITH THE PROCEEDS
FROM THAT ONLINE SUPERSTORE

16:07.444 --> 16:10.752
THAT HE BUILT ON OUR BACKS!EITHER OF YOU HAPPEN TO CATCH
THE NAME OF THIS WOMAN?

16:10.752 --> 16:13.581
ROXY.ROXY.

16:13.581 --> 16:19.717
SO, WE WERE ALL
CLOSE TO BENJAMIN.

16:19.717 --> 16:23.069
[sighs]

16:23.069 --> 16:26.202
I WAS HIS SPONSOR
FOR TEN YEARS.

16:26.202 --> 16:31.120
BUT REALLY,
HE HELPED MEUP.

16:34.341 --> 16:39.650
IT'S OKAY, I'M OKAY.

BUT I-I C--I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT. I...

18:25.930 --> 18:27.758
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.206
BUT YOU SEEM IMMUNE, SO I MAY
HAVE TO STEP UP MY EFFORTS.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.166

WE GET A CALL FROM A NEIGHBOR,

21:29.375 --> 21:32.900
SAYS SHE HEARS A LOT OF CRASHING
INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.902

LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.991
[sighs]
ANY SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY?

21:36.991 --> 21:39.298
NONE. WE THINK SOMEBODY
HAD THE KEY.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.213
MUST HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THE ELVES. [chuckles]

21:44.912 --> 21:46.914
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

21:46.914 --> 21:49.873
SURE. BENJAMIN.
WE HUNG OUT.

21:49.873 --> 21:53.137
HE WAS MURDERED TWO DAYS AGO.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.922
OKAY.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.968
YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY BROKEN UP OVER THIS.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.666
WHY SHOULD I BE?
I DON'T MARRY THEM.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.495
JUST PROVIDE
A STANDARD G.F.E.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.846
G.F.E.?GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.718
I'M PAID TO SHOW UP
AND ACT LIKE I LIKE THEM,

22:08.718 --> 22:11.025
BUT I DON'T GET EMOTIONALLY
INVOLVED WITH CLIENTS.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.462
THAT WAY MADNESS LIES,
YOU KNOW?

22:13.462 --> 22:16.117
AND RIPPLE WAS A CLIENT.NO...

22:16.117 --> 22:19.990
BUT YOU WERE HIS DATE
AT THE SANTA CONVENTION?I WAS PAID BY SOMEONE ELSE.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.688
AND HOW DOES THAT WORK?

22:21.688 --> 22:25.082
I'M PAID TO ATTEND A.A. MEETINGS
AND RECOVERY GROUPS

22:25.082 --> 22:26.519
AND RECRUIT PATIENTS.

22:26.519 --> 22:30.000
PATIENTS FOR WHAT?THIS MAN, JACK WILDER.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.874
HE OWNS A TREATMENT FACILITY
FOR ALCOHOL ADDICTION.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.266
VERY EXCLUSIVE.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.878
ONLY THE FINANCIALLY SECURE
CAN AFFORD IT.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.228
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--
WILDER HIRES YOU

22:40.228 --> 22:42.535
TO CRUISE A.A. MEETINGS
LOOKING FOR RICH DRUNKS?

22:42.535 --> 22:44.537
I MEET 'EM, CHAT 'EM UP,
AND TELL THEM

22:44.537 --> 22:47.496
ABOUT THIS MIRACULOUS TREATMENT
FACILITY THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

22:47.496 --> 22:50.020
SO YOU UNDERWENT THE TREATMENT?

22:50.020 --> 22:53.589
NO. [chuckles]
TEQUILA IS MY DEAR FRIEND.

22:53.589 --> 22:56.549
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CENTER
DIDN'T CHANGE MY LIFE.

22:56.549 --> 22:59.639
YOU SHOULD SEE MY NEW JAGUAR.

22:59.639 --> 23:00.988
NO DOUBT.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.990
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS
FOR WILDER?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.122
YOU WERE VERY BRAVE
YESTERDAY,

23:05.122 --> 23:06.776
SHARING LIKE THAT.

23:06.776 --> 23:10.737
NAH. YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH BENJAMIN, WEREN'T YOU?

23:10.737 --> 23:15.089
IT'S WHY THE PROGRAM DOESN'T
ENCOURAGE OPPOSITE-SEX SPONSORS.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.874
BUT HE DIDN'T RETURN
THE FEELINGS.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.876
I THINK HE DID...

23:19.876 --> 23:22.531
IN HIS OWN WAY.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.665
BUT BENJAMIN HAD
HIS PRIORITIES.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.318
THE RED SUIT.

23:27.318 --> 23:30.800
I IMAGINE THAT LEFT YOU
FEELING IGNORED? ALONE? ANGRY?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.193
GOT THAT RIGHT.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.977
ANGRY ENOUGH
TO DESTROY HIS HOME?

23:35.979 --> 23:37.198
WHO ARE YOU?

23:37.198 --> 23:39.505
I'M A CONSULTANT FOR THE CBI.

23:39.505 --> 23:42.769
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
BENJAMIN'S MURDER.YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR ADDICTION?

23:42.769 --> 23:45.554
NO. THAT'S REAL ENOUGH,
I SUPPOSE.

23:45.554 --> 23:48.252
WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT
BENJAMIN WAS KILLED?

23:48.252 --> 23:50.298
ALONE IN MY APARTMENT.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.909
MAY, THEY'RE GONNA TREAT YOU
LIKE A SUSPECT.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.998
YOU DESTROYED
THEIR CRIME SCENE.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.087
I WENT THERE
TO FIND SOMETHING.

23:57.087 --> 24:01.091
YOU KNOW, TO--TO REMEMBER
BENJAMIN BY?

24:01.091 --> 24:04.312
WHEN I SAW THE DECORATIONS,
I-I GOT MAD.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.315
SANTA WAS...

24:07.315 --> 24:10.492
WAS ANOTHER FORM OF ADDICTION
FOR BENJAMIN.

24:10.492 --> 24:14.061
ANY TIME ANYTHING CUTS YOU OFF
FROM EXPERIENCING YOUR LIFE,

24:14.061 --> 24:15.671
I-IT'S UNHEALTHY, RIGHT?

24:15.671 --> 24:17.020
WOULDN'T KNOW.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.369
LAST WEEK,

24:18.369 --> 24:20.850
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN TEN YEARS,

24:20.850 --> 24:23.418
HE TOOK A SHOT OF VODKA.

24:23.418 --> 24:26.682
IT CRUSHED BOTH OF US.

24:29.293 --> 24:32.949
IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR IN BENJAMIN'S APARTMENT?

24:32.949 --> 24:36.649
[gasps]

24:38.389 --> 24:41.871
BEST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.705
[pen scribbles]

24:51.490 --> 24:53.448
JACK WILDER,
BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.929
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.497
AGENT LISBON, VAN PELT.
WE'RE WITH THE CBI.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.673
WE CAME TO SEE IF

25:00.673 --> 25:02.675
BENJAMIN RIPPLE
WAS A PATIENT HERE.

25:02.675 --> 25:06.896
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS IN MY OFFICE.

25:06.896 --> 25:10.900
THIS IS A LICENSED
MEDICAL FACILITY, LADIES.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.946
MY CLIENT LIST IS PRIVILEGED.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.251
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.950
TECHNICALLY, NO,
BUT I DO HAVE A LICENSE--

25:16.950 --> 25:19.300
WELL, THIS IS A HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION. YOU'RE A SUSPECT.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.171
THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE HERE.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.696
HOMICIDE? BENJAMIN'S DEAD?

25:23.696 --> 25:25.872
WITH ENOUGH ALCOHOL IN
HIS SYSTEM TO KILL AN ELEPHANT.

25:25.872 --> 25:28.265
A GIRL FROM AN ESCORT SERVICE
SAYS THAT YOU PAID HER

25:28.265 --> 25:30.746
TO STEER BENJAMIN TO
YOUR CLINIC. IS THAT CORRECT?

25:30.746 --> 25:33.314
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. MY CLIENTS
WOULD NEVER TAKE A DRINK

25:33.314 --> 25:35.098
SO SOON AFTER TREATMENT.
WHEN DID HE DIE?

25:35.098 --> 25:36.709
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.841
WHEN DID YOU TREAT HIM?

25:38.841 --> 25:41.975
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

25:43.846 --> 25:47.197
AVERSION THERAPY CAN BE USED
TO TREAT ANY BAD HABIT--

25:47.197 --> 25:50.853
UH, SMOKING, ALCOHOLISM,
GAMBLING, VIOLENCE...

25:50.853 --> 25:52.289
SEXUAL DEVIANCY.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.422
MY METHODS ARE BASED

25:54.422 --> 25:56.555
ON CLASSICAL CONDITIONING
TECHNIQUES.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.340
PLEASE.[door squeaks]

25:59.340 --> 26:01.951
I CAN TURN THE PLEASURABLE
ACTIVITY OF DRINKING

26:01.951 --> 26:03.562
INTO A REPULSIVE ONE

26:03.562 --> 26:05.520
BY PAIRING IT
WITH NOXIOUS SMELLS,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.609
NAUSEA-INDUCING MEDICATION,

26:07.609 --> 26:10.003
LOW-GRADE ELECTRIC SHOCK.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.832
OF COURSE, I RECORD ALL
MY SESSIONS ON A HARD DRIVE

26:12.832 --> 26:16.226
FOR INSURANCE REASONS, SO...[click]

26:16.226 --> 26:18.315
UH... AH, HERE WE GO.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.622
HE'S BLOWING .20.

26:20.622 --> 26:24.017
150 OVER 90.
WE SHOULD STOP NOW. HE'S OKAY.

26:24.017 --> 26:27.673
WHO IS THAT NURSE THERE?UH, LAILAH BLOOM.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.936
REGISTERED NURSE. TEN YEARS
E.R. EXPERIENCE BEHIND HER.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.547
SHE MONITORS MY PATIENTS
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.897
WE HAVE VERY STRICT
SAFETY PROTOCOLS.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.464
HOW YOU FEELING, BENJAMIN?

26:36.464 --> 26:37.813
BEAUTIFUL. [chuckles]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.859
UH, SLEEPY.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.949
I LOVE THIS GUY. [chuckles]

26:42.949 --> 26:45.865
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN TURN THE CAMERA OFF NOW.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.737
LET'S GET YOU HOME. [Velcro rips]

26:48.737 --> 26:50.043
[click]

26:50.043 --> 26:52.654
AS YOU CAN SEE,
HE WAS PERFECTLY FINE.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.048
AFTER TREATMENT, I DROVE
BENJAMIN BACK TO HIS APARTMENT.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.224
YOU WERE INSIDE HIS HOME
THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED.

26:57.224 --> 27:01.010
I MAKE SURE ALL MY PATIENTS
GET HOME SAFELY.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.664
[sighs][clatter]

27:02.664 --> 27:05.667
WHAT I OFFER HERE IS A VERY
PERSONAL, HANDS-ON THERAPY.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.017
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
EFFECTIVE CHANGE

27:08.017 --> 27:10.106
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.THAT AND CALL GIRLS.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.500
IT'S AN INTERESTING WAY
TO DRUM UP BUSINESS.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.895
WHAT YOU SEE AS A CALL GIRL,
I SEE AS A MARKETING EXPERT

27:15.895 --> 27:18.593
WITH KEEN INSIGHTS
INTO THE NEEDS AND DESIRES

27:18.593 --> 27:22.423
OF MY CLIENTELE. I FOCUS ON
HIGHLY DRIVEN PROFESSIONALS.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.212
GIVE US A FEW MINUTES?SORRY.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.824
MEN LIKE BENJAMIN
HAVE MORE TO LOSE

27:31.824 --> 27:34.391
IF THEY CAN'T CONTROL
THEIR URGES.

27:34.391 --> 27:38.004
BEFORE YOU TRASH MY METHODS,
TALK TO MY PATIENTS.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.833
MY SUCCESS RATE IS HIGHER THAN
ANY ALCOHOL TREATMENT CENTER

27:40.833 --> 27:42.095
IN THE STATE.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.924
EXCUSE ME.
I NEED TO MAKE A CALL.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.361
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT ENTIRE VIDEO.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.233
[paper shuffling]

27:52.627 --> 27:56.239
LAILAH, RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?

27:56.239 --> 27:58.285
FINE.

27:58.285 --> 28:01.462
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.204
TALK TO ME.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.773
[sighs] DID MR. WILDER
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED

28:07.773 --> 28:09.775
AFTER I TURNED OFF THE CAMERA?

28:12.299 --> 28:15.563
BENJAMIN PASSED OUT.

28:15.563 --> 28:18.087
HIS BREATHING WAS SHALLOW,
HIS TEMPERATURE WAS DROPPING.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.132
ALCOHOL POISONING?

28:19.132 --> 28:20.916
YES.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.137
I TOLD MR. WILDER WE SHOULD
GET BENJAMIN TO A DOCTOR--

28:24.137 --> 28:26.269
A MEDICALDOCTOR.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.358
BUT HE SAID HE HAD IT
UNDER CONTROL,

28:28.358 --> 28:29.969
AND THEY LEFT.

28:29.969 --> 28:34.713
HAS ANYTHING LIKE THAT EVER
HAPPENED HERE BEFORE?

28:34.713 --> 28:38.542
LOOK, I THINK MR. WILDER
IS A GREAT MAN, OKAY?

28:38.542 --> 28:40.544
I GREW UP
WITH ALCOHOLIC PARENTS,

28:40.544 --> 28:44.200
SO I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN
PUSHING LIMITS TO FIND A CURE.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.420
BUT NOW...

28:46.420 --> 28:48.814
I DON'T KNOW.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.338
THANKS FOR TALKING TO ME.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.427
[sighs]

28:53.427 --> 28:55.864
LAILAH SAID RIPPLE WAS SHOWING
SIGNS OF ALCOHOL POISONING.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.084
THE CORONER TOLD ME
THAT'S CONSISTENT

28:58.084 --> 29:01.522
WITH WHAT HE FOUND
AT AUTOPSY.OKAY, SO JACK WILDER DRIVES
RIPPLE HOME.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.916
MAYBE RIPPLE PASSES OUT,
WILDER CAN'T REVIVE HIM,

29:03.916 --> 29:06.962
SO HE STAGES A SUICIDE
RATHER THAN RISK LOSING IT ALL.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.355
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.357
THE EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.ALL OF IT.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.838
I DON'T EVEN THINK WE HAVE
ENOUGH FOR A SEARCH WARRANT.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.927
WHAT KIND
OF CHARACTER WITNESS

29:14.927 --> 29:19.018
DO YOU THINK LAILAH
WOULD MAKE IN COURT?SHE DOES
FEEL LOYALTY FOR WILDER.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.063
I CHECKED
HER EMPLOYMENT HISTORY.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.413
SHE LEFT A $70,000 JOB
AT SACRAMENTO GENERAL

29:23.413 --> 29:25.981
TWO MONTHS AGO TO WORK FOR HIM.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.027
ON THE OTHER HAND,
BOTH HER PARENTS WERE ALCOHOLIC.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.724
I THINK THAT'S WHERE
HER REAL SYMPATHY LIES.

29:29.724 --> 29:33.554
PARENTS WEREALCOHOLIC?

29:33.554 --> 29:35.861
HER MOM DIED IN A CAR CRASH.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.340
SHE WAS DRUNK.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.081
CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER
TOOK HER DAD.

29:39.081 --> 29:41.257
ALSO ALCOHOL-RELATED.

29:41.257 --> 29:45.958
CHANCE HAS THRUST OUR WAY A VERY
SORDID AND VEXING PROBLEM.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.612
BUT HAVE NO FEAR.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.571
WE DON'T.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.922
I DO. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

29:59.623 --> 30:02.539
THANK YOU FOR, UH,
FITTING ME IN.

30:02.539 --> 30:06.805
OUR CORPORATE RETREAT
IS IN TWO DAYS.THAT'S WHY IT'S CRUCIAL
TO GET STARTED NOW.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.503
[clears throat] YOU'RE SURE
YOU'VE HAD NOTHING TO EAT TODAY?NO, NO, NO.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.505
TO STRESSED TO EAT.

30:11.505 --> 30:14.334
THEY SAY IT'S A RAFTING TRIP.
IT'S REALLY JUST AN EXCUSE

30:14.334 --> 30:17.554
TO DRINK LIKE GERMANS
FOR A WEEKEND.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.906
[sighs] I CAN'T AFFORD TO SLIP.
I'M UP FOR C.E.O.

30:20.906 --> 30:24.126
DON'T WORRY, PATRICK.
ALL BEHAVIOR IS LEARNED.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.302
AND WITH MY HELP, SOON,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.478
YOUR UNWANTED BEHAVIOR
WILL BE UNLEARNED.

30:28.478 --> 30:31.133
NOW I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DIAL.MM-HMM.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.266
AND SELECT A LEVEL OF CURRENT

30:33.266 --> 30:35.268
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT NOT PAINFUL.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.403
[electric humming][chuckles]

30:40.403 --> 30:41.883
TICKLES.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.319
OOH. OKAY.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.147
TOUCHY.

30:45.147 --> 30:48.194
TONIGHT, WE ARE GONNA TAKE
THE FUN OUT OF DRINKING FOR YOU.

30:50.370 --> 30:53.503
LAILAH, POUR THE MAN
SOME WHISKEY.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.027
AH.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.379
BOTTOMS UP.

31:07.039 --> 31:11.217
[electric thrumming]MM! OOH. I FELT THAT.
[chuckles]

31:11.217 --> 31:13.219
I DID FEEL THAT.

31:13.219 --> 31:16.178
OUR GOAL IS TO ASSOCIATE ALCOHOL
AND ALL OF ITS SOCIAL RITUALS

31:16.178 --> 31:17.701
WITH THE UNPLEASANT SENSATION

31:17.701 --> 31:20.356
OF ELECTRICITY
RUNNING THROUGH YOUR BODY.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.010
OKAY.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.628
[electric thrumming][laughing]

31:33.065 --> 31:35.850
[electric thrumming]MM. MM! [laughs]

31:35.850 --> 31:38.026
[hissing]

31:38.026 --> 31:41.073
[clatter][Wilder] GOOD.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.030
GOOD, GOOD.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.336
TAXI.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.338
HOW YOU FEELING, PATRICK?

31:45.338 --> 31:47.470
WELL, LAILAH, I'M PROBABLY
NOT GOING TO REMEMBER MUCH

31:47.470 --> 31:50.125
ABOUT TONIGHT,
SO LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT

31:50.125 --> 31:53.128
TO REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT FOREVER TOGETHER.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.523
YOU HAVE BROWN EYES
AND YOU'RE WEARING EARRINGS.

31:56.523 --> 31:59.656
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.TIME TO RAISE THE CURRENT.

31:59.656 --> 32:02.094
REALLY?[beep]

32:02.094 --> 32:04.531
THESE RESTRAINTS WILL MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY

32:04.531 --> 32:06.272
DISLODGE YOUR ELECTRODES.

32:06.272 --> 32:10.145
