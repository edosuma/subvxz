02:03.027 --> 02:06.431
You expect me to believe a man done this?

02:08.967 --> 02:09.835
One man?

02:11.770 --> 02:15.274
An unarmed man did all this?

02:17.675 --> 02:18.543
That's what we're told.

02:20.544 --> 02:21.679
By whom, exactly?

02:54.045 --> 02:55.246
What happened here?

02:57.481 --> 02:58.850
He was waiting for them.

03:00.485 --> 03:01.976
And he began to ask questions.

03:01.986 --> 03:04.578
How about?

03:04.588 --> 03:06.224
About you.

03:07.558 --> 03:08.561
What about me?

03:09.662 --> 03:12.521
I do not know, but they began to argue.

03:12.531 --> 03:13.399
What happened?

03:15.567 --> 03:16.735
All hell broke loose.

03:33.518 --> 03:35.476
Keep working, you.

03:35.486 --> 03:38.257
We need to get this railroad built.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.885
I know it's not much, though.

04:09.554 --> 04:10.622
That's perfect.

04:17.396 --> 04:18.264
You are perfect.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.634
And one day we will have land for our own

04:23.769 --> 04:24.970
and a house for all.

04:26.704 --> 04:28.339
I'm happy where we are, Jing.

04:30.007 --> 04:30.875
I know but.

04:33.812 --> 04:35.547
I do not need much.

04:37.581 --> 04:38.850
I just need you.

04:42.620 --> 04:47.625
I just need us.

04:57.836 --> 04:58.704
Forever.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.040
Forever.

06:50.314 --> 06:51.149
Take it up.

07:06.031 --> 07:06.865
Take it up.

07:13.004 --> 07:15.941
You pick either up or I'll shoot you dead.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.117
Take it up.

07:27.351 --> 07:28.219
Take it up.

07:45.637 --> 07:46.637
I'm sorry.

07:52.377 --> 07:54.012
You just drew on a law man.

08:16.634 --> 08:17.800
Get up boy.

08:27.812 --> 08:29.770
You've got to be out of your mind.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.082
Get away from my bars.

08:33.317 --> 08:34.885
I have not done anything wrong.

08:38.956 --> 08:41.592
Well it is a matter of perspective now, is not it?

08:42.693 --> 08:44.295
When the marshal comes back to town,

08:45.397 --> 08:46.921
he will decide what to do with you.

08:46.931 --> 08:48.188
When the marshal comes back to town,

08:48.198 --> 08:49.734
He sees that I am innocent.

08:51.235 --> 08:55.106
You are many things, but innocent is not one of them, boy.

08:57.676 --> 09:00.802
Jesus Christ, really, he smells like a fucking animal.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.315
You may want sick hose on him, Frank.

09:10.955 --> 09:12.212
Ask me where I was going.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.682
Where you heading to, Deputy?

09:13.692 --> 09:15.283
I'm glad you asked, you see

09:15.293 --> 09:17.696
I got a date with a friend,

09:19.063 --> 09:22.856
and I think our Mr. Chinese know exactly who she is,

09:22.866 --> 09:25.836
In fact, I know you know who she is.

09:28.239 --> 09:30.398
Now you've got to be out of your damn mind,

09:30.408 --> 09:32.978
I'm going to paint these walls with your brains.

09:39.049 --> 09:41.241
I am a man got a problem with.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.120
Let her be.

09:43.254 --> 09:44.122
Problem?

09:52.764 --> 09:54.855
I do not have a problem with you.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.258
I see you as nothing, except one

09:57.268 --> 10:00.729
Perhaps there is between the dirt and the cockroaches,

10:00.739 --> 10:02.908
but nothing of importance in my world.

10:04.808 --> 10:08.736
Your woman, but I have a problem with her.

10:08.746 --> 10:12.373
You see, I have yellow fever, and I hope

10:12.383 --> 10:13.619
she is the cure.

11:22.553 --> 11:25.013
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you

11:25.023 --> 11:28.125
at such wicked hour, Miss ...

11:31.596 --> 11:33.230
Phang, Phang froken.

11:34.365 --> 11:35.466
Is everything okay?

11:38.235 --> 11:41.428
I'm not going to lie to you, it's about your husband.

11:41.438 --> 11:43.841
I'm afraid he's in a lot of trouble.

11:45.442 --> 11:50.081
But I assure you, I am here to help you in any way I can.

11:55.419 --> 11:56.288
Where is he?

11:58.155 --> 12:00.480
There was an incident in the town.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.216
I saw it, it was not Jing wrong.

12:02.226 --> 12:04.518
Now, now, I'm not here to discuss the law

12:04.528 --> 12:06.798
or who did or did not do something.

12:08.166 --> 12:12.304
I'm just here to help you, you and your husband, to do this,

12:14.371 --> 12:15.372
fred-like.

12:22.547 --> 12:23.481
Hi Frank.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.447
Now, son, I had patience, I've been kind,

12:33.457 --> 12:35.416
but you made burnt my patience

12:35.426 --> 12:38.318
down to the fucking ground.

12:38.328 --> 12:40.555
You yellow-skinned shit,

12:40.565 --> 12:42.934
keep your hands off of ...

14:00.445 --> 14:04.216
You said he was, I must go and find my husband.

14:05.682 --> 14:09.888
I think you misunderstood my intentions.

14:26.703 --> 14:29.529
I'm sorry for the confusion.

14:29.539 --> 14:32.343
Your husband is clearly not here.

14:34.479 --> 14:37.038
I brought you here for personal reasons.

14:37.048 --> 14:41.620
Now I can help reunite you with him, and I would like to.

14:43.553 --> 14:46.323
But you will need to do one small thing for me.

14:48.058 --> 14:50.160
To get some, you have to give a little.

14:53.464 --> 14:55.500
Now you want to go and see your husband?

15:01.706 --> 15:02.908
Take my hand.

15:09.813 --> 15:10.682
Oh.

15:12.115 --> 15:13.918
This place brings back memories.

15:16.053 --> 15:20.125
See, when I was a kid, this place used to be

15:22.225 --> 15:23.394
a slaughterhouse.

15:25.429 --> 15:29.600
Still actually see blood stains on the animals.

15:31.701 --> 15:32.570
No.

15:36.474 --> 15:39.200
There will be over real soon, okay?

15:39.210 --> 15:41.079
And then you see your husband.

15:44.548 --> 15:47.682
You see him real soon, just be ...

15:58.729 --> 15:59.597
It is okay.

16:01.532 --> 16:02.533
It is okay.

16:05.735 --> 16:06.604
Shh.

16:08.105 --> 16:08.974
Shh.

16:14.144 --> 16:15.145
It is okay.

16:55.785 --> 16:56.653
Woo!

17:02.359 --> 17:03.227
Hey now.

17:25.781 --> 17:26.650
Ã…h of.

17:35.792 --> 17:36.660
Fuck.

17:42.232 --> 17:43.100
Ã…h of.

18:23.473 --> 18:24.608
Oh no no no.

18:26.544 --> 18:27.412
Oh no.

18:46.998 --> 18:47.865
Oh no.

18:51.535 --> 18:52.403
No.

19:19.663 --> 19:20.531
Hello!

19:21.565 --> 19:22.567
I need help!

19:26.604 --> 19:27.961
Hello!

19:27.971 --> 19:28.839
Hello!

19:33.009 --> 19:33.877
Hello!

19:39.416 --> 19:44.422
Hello!

20:31.801 --> 20:33.461
Hello.

20:33.471 --> 20:35.363
Do not turn your back on me.

20:35.373 --> 20:36.374
All I need is a name.

20:43.012 --> 20:44.014
Crack.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.017
It is best to start where you came from.

21:00.964 --> 21:02.930
I just need his name.

21:47.678 --> 21:49.737
I just need his name.

21:49.747 --> 21:51.316
You can kill me.

21:52.115 --> 21:54.519
What do you think I'll go do?

22:19.042 --> 22:20.610
He gave him what he wanted.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.772
What are you talking about?

22:25.782 --> 22:27.484
So you would be looking for him.

22:30.054 --> 22:32.557
Said to give this to Marshal Walker.

22:56.313 --> 22:57.548
Get some men together.

23:00.084 --> 23:01.719
And give me a tracker.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.622
What is it, Danny?

23:07.758 --> 23:08.692
Jake Sanders.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.561
He then?

23:12.262 --> 23:14.054
Jake was our tracker.

23:14.064 --> 23:15.600
Then find me another!

23:16.666 --> 23:17.534
Get!

23:23.807 --> 23:27.412
Make sure they get a fittin 'funeral.

23:31.214 --> 23:32.649
What a fucking mess.

23:37.654 --> 23:38.522
Jesus.

24:18.295 --> 24:19.230
He had not paid.

24:21.731 --> 24:23.733
Stick it on his tab, he's good for it.

24:42.318 --> 24:43.185
Go up!

24:54.964 --> 24:56.289
The gentlemen have me at a disadvantage,

24:56.299 --> 25:01.672
You seem to know who I am, I do not know who you are.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.575
Got a job for you.

25:09.913 --> 25:10.636
I'm retired.

25:10.646 --> 25:11.948
Not today you do not.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.918
So I guess I have no choice.

25:24.928 --> 25:25.997
No you do not.

25:30.334 --> 25:31.959
Vem grace '?

25:31.969 --> 25:33.701
Marshal Walker.

25:34.771 --> 25:35.705
What's the job?

25:37.106 --> 25:38.209
It is somewhat easy.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.011
You must track down a man.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.074
It's easy, huh?

25:47.084 --> 25:48.885
Why you need me?

25:50.921 --> 25:52.590
We need this done quickly.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.326
One thing I learned about trackin 'men.

25:56.693 --> 25:58.685
It is never easy and you damn sure never in a hurry.

25:58.695 --> 26:01.063
Well, there are two things.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.268
That one's a keeper.

26:06.836 --> 26:08.105
Where are my fucking britches?

26:10.039 --> 26:11.075
Crap.

26:20.851 --> 26:22.875
We will be looking Waitin.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.711
Come on, Danny.

26:24.721 --> 26:26.891
The second riders'll meet ya tomorrow.

27:03.093 --> 27:03.961
Marshal.

27:04.894 --> 27:05.762
Gallery.

27:20.844 --> 27:22.647
That should cover it.

27:26.182 --> 27:28.919
I take really good care of them.

27:31.521 --> 27:33.223
Just get them out on the street.

27:34.423 --> 27:36.257
Folks do not need to see this.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.224
He takes a wee, you hold it for him,

28:18.234 --> 28:20.560
he takes a shit, wiping up to him.

28:20.570 --> 28:22.105
But you keep him safe.

28:24.974 --> 28:28.234
Even Frank would really enjoy it,

28:28.244 --> 28:32.239
I am quite capable of taking care of myself.

28:32.249 --> 28:37.254
Which begs the question, why do not I join them?

28:47.196 --> 28:48.431
Give us a minute, Frank.

28:52.536 --> 28:57.508
Because to be your father, it's my job

28:58.275 --> 28:59.844
To protect yourself, James.

29:01.478 --> 29:02.513
Read this.

29:11.255 --> 29:15.147
Now you know why you can not go and why we need to finish this,

29:15.157 --> 29:17.250
be done with it.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.152
Let me clean up my own mess.

29:19.162 --> 29:22.098
Best you remember who made this mess in the first place.

29:23.232 --> 29:26.393
Makes me sick to think about what you've done.

29:26.403 --> 29:28.204
Do not take your eyes off me, boy.

29:32.276 --> 29:35.446
Best we get this dealt with quickly and let people forget

29:36.445 --> 29:39.605
if the Chinese and his wife.

29:39.615 --> 29:40.473
They will not ...

29:40.483 --> 29:41.351
Hello.

29:43.053 --> 29:44.577
You are my son and I love you, James,

29:44.587 --> 29:49.159
but this is the last time, the last fucking time.

29:54.564 --> 29:57.368
I made your mother a promise God rest his soul,

29:59.269 --> 30:01.438
I would keep you outta trouble.

30:06.410 --> 30:08.512
Trouble just seems to find you, right?

30:10.380 --> 30:13.250
And right now, I ask for forgiveness,

30:14.451 --> 30:15.952
and you oughta go with me.

30:23.093 --> 30:25.496
God turned his back on us long ago.

30:27.663 --> 30:28.566
You old fool.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.118
Mister,

33:05.588 --> 33:06.723
as far as the boy

33:09.392 --> 33:12.028
I've tried hard to forgive him.

33:16.133 --> 33:19.759
But it's just no good in him.

33:19.769 --> 33:20.636
It has never been.

33:23.140 --> 33:27.534
But fuck me, I made a promise to his mother on her deathbed

33:27.544 --> 33:30.314
I would make sure that no harm would come to him,

33:31.213 --> 33:32.582
even though I know it should.

33:34.451 --> 33:35.786
Forgive me for it.

33:39.288 --> 33:40.557
Forgive me for it.

34:08.318 --> 34:09.186
Whoa.

34:13.722 --> 34:15.281
You see something?

34:15.291 --> 34:16.549
And.

34:16.559 --> 34:17.917
City.

34:17.927 --> 34:21.786
You know, Senor, we're gettin 'real tired of your jokes.

34:21.797 --> 34:23.632
I buried only four of my men.

34:24.601 --> 34:26.824
We paid for results.

34:26.835 --> 34:28.092
Paid.

34:28.103 --> 34:30.429
First of all, no one spoke to me about money.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.565
Second of all, this guy killed four of your men.

34:32.576 --> 34:33.667
He did.

34:33.677 --> 34:34.545
Perhaps.

34:35.746 --> 34:37.837
But I see the badges attached to you and your friends.

34:37.847 --> 34:40.684
We are not planning to bring him in alive, tendons.

34:42.251 --> 34:44.387
Well, I'm a tracker, not a hunter.

34:46.289 --> 34:47.880
Do we have a problem, Senor?

34:47.891 --> 34:48.759
I do not.

34:49.860 --> 34:50.583
But maybe you do not put that steel

34:50.594 --> 34:52.128
back where it belongs.

34:53.230 --> 34:54.231
Now, about my fee.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.668
Eh.

34:59.635 --> 35:00.503
Senor.

35:02.606 --> 35:05.509
When we discover that the Chinese, and we do not need you anymore,

35:06.976 --> 35:09.579
We'll come back to this conversation, huh?

35:10.579 --> 35:11.447
Can not wait.

35:12.514 --> 35:14.941
And just for the record, I like women.

35:14.951 --> 35:17.521
Ya baby.

35:20.856 --> 35:24.258
And he says that fella's lucky in the short as well.

35:25.394 --> 35:26.252
Hey, she said.

35:26.262 --> 35:27.695
Hello Darling.

35:58.695 --> 36:00.364
Go up.

36:04.434 --> 36:06.370
Excuse me, gentlemen.

36:11.507 --> 36:14.366
Well, you are not angry enough to fight

36:14.376 --> 36:16.502
a bear with a hickory switch?

36:16.512 --> 36:19.071
There are four good men layin 'in pine boxes

36:19.081 --> 36:22.575
out on the street right there because of what you did.

36:22.585 --> 36:24.487
You have blood on your hands, boy.

36:25.422 --> 36:26.757
I said I'm sorry.

36:27.757 --> 36:28.692
You are sad.

36:29.925 --> 36:31.527
Sorry is not good enough.

36:32.862 --> 36:35.721
I come in here and catch you laughin 'and drinkin'.

36:35.731 --> 36:38.024
Might as well be pissin 'on their bodies.

36:38.034 --> 36:40.459
And what should I do?

36:40.469 --> 36:41.861
I'm not allowed to hunt the bastard,

36:41.871 --> 36:47.277
I'm not allowed to drink, what I may do, Father?

36:48.610 --> 36:49.636
You will go home and you'll stay there

36:49.646 --> 36:50.581
until this happens.

36:51.715 --> 36:54.006
Maybe if we're lucky, we cook it quickly

36:54.016 --> 36:56.385
you are still alive, but I promise you,

36:57.686 --> 37:00.346
I catch you in town again drinkin 'or whorin'

37:00.356 --> 37:04.760
Before you get caught, you get me to contend with.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.240
You better be ready to go all-in.

37:19.876 --> 37:22.312
You are not worth the bullet, old man.

37:51.775 --> 37:55.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:55.177 --> 37:56.045
Whoa.

38:45.894 --> 38:46.762
Hyah.

38:56.139 --> 38:57.863
It is the horse he stole from us.

38:57.873 --> 38:58.974
He is walking now.

39:00.610 --> 39:01.868
Well I guess that says something about the man

39:01.878 --> 39:02.868
you are in when not?

39:02.878 --> 39:04.014
The man we hunt.

39:05.581 --> 39:06.839
And.

39:06.849 --> 39:08.050
Yes, that's what I said.

39:09.552 --> 39:11.054
And he is not a man.

39:12.188 --> 39:13.090
Horse is lame.

39:14.490 --> 39:16.883
Figure that is why he does not want to ride it in the dirt.

39:16.893 --> 39:18.484
Hyah.

39:18.494 --> 39:22.689
Hyah.

39:22.699 --> 39:24.401
That horse does not look lame.

39:25.702 --> 39:27.637
Oh, you know a lot about horses, then do ya?

39:28.972 --> 39:31.029
I know that the horse belongs to us.

39:31.039 --> 39:32.909
Well why do not you go chase it, then?

39:34.943 --> 39:39.949
You know, gringo, you become a real pain in the ass.

39:41.284 --> 39:42.609
You may want to have controlled by Dr. Wade

39:42.619 --> 39:43.787
when you get back there.

39:44.887 --> 39:46.155
Could be anything serious.

39:47.523 --> 39:50.883
There will be serious when we discover that the Chinese, right?

39:50.893 --> 39:51.761
To you.

39:54.264 --> 39:57.032
I thought that's why you have not discussed my fee yet.

40:02.038 --> 40:03.072
Not too dark.

40:04.206 --> 40:05.297
Let's make camp.

40:05.307 --> 40:06.633
Camp?

40:06.643 --> 40:07.799
We just found his groove!

40:07.809 --> 40:09.903
Hey, we're going to follow him now.

40:09.913 --> 40:12.772
Maybe you missed the part about it is dark.

40:12.782 --> 40:14.684
I can not save what I can not see.

40:15.952 --> 40:16.820
Camp.

40:32.068 --> 40:32.969
Get away.

40:35.304 --> 40:36.138
Also in '.

40:40.309 --> 40:43.303
Do I look as if we are running late.

40:43.313 --> 40:44.571
What do you expect?

40:44.581 --> 40:45.705
Chinese do all the work.

40:45.715 --> 40:48.140
I expect when I pay good money for a job

40:48.150 --> 40:50.519
it oughta be done when I need it done.

40:51.353 --> 40:52.788
Speakin 'salary.

40:54.023 --> 40:56.214
You owe me on my drawing.

40:56.224 --> 40:57.760
I got mouths to feed, too.

41:08.871 --> 41:10.773
You are lucky needs these tracks.

41:13.742 --> 41:15.578
Pleasure doing business with you.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.791
Did you hear that?

41:33.795 --> 41:34.663
Where?

41:37.266 --> 41:38.768
Spread out, spread out, dammit.

43:00.248 --> 43:01.350
Are you hungry?

43:05.188 --> 43:06.056
Well.

43:12.128 --> 43:14.197
What is your plan, son?

43:23.039 --> 43:24.841
Who said I had one?

43:27.876 --> 43:30.770
Well, you'll just keep killin men

43:30.780 --> 43:32.349
until you get what you are looking for?

43:33.882 --> 43:34.750
Mm-hmm.

43:36.085 --> 43:40.023
I hoped that I was looking for was with you.

43:42.224 --> 43:45.161
You know Walker's son, too lazy pig pen.

43:46.528 --> 43:48.764
Do you really think that he can come out here lookin 'for you?

43:49.931 --> 43:52.201
Now his father, his father's men.

43:53.802 --> 43:57.106
It's a Whole Lotta weapon to go up against a single man.

44:02.545 --> 44:05.782
Man you after it's quite the man hiding behind other men.

44:08.083 --> 44:09.985
They're not stoppin 'until you are dead.

44:13.356 --> 44:14.324
I'm already dead.

44:45.822 --> 44:47.190
What will you do with it?

44:48.824 --> 44:50.693
I have not really decided yet.

44:52.094 --> 44:53.697
But I need to resign.

44:58.900 --> 44:59.768
Do it.

45:01.903 --> 45:03.106
Send me to my family.

45:07.409 --> 45:09.478
Why not walk away from this, son.

45:21.489 --> 45:23.492
There is nothing in it.

45:29.197 --> 45:32.735
The bastard never the right place when I need it.

45:38.541 --> 45:43.747
Why do not you help me?

45:49.018 --> 45:51.420
What do you want me to do, son?

45:54.489 --> 45:56.091
Just send a message to him.

46:01.097 --> 46:02.065
I can do it.

46:04.300 --> 46:05.168
Whoa.

46:07.637 --> 46:08.505
Ho.

46:09.938 --> 46:12.397
What the hell happened here?

46:12.407 --> 46:14.500
Damn you think happened?

46:14.510 --> 46:15.445
When the marshal?

46:22.284 --> 46:24.286
Should be in his house on the hill.

46:32.128 --> 46:32.996
Shoot.

46:34.297 --> 46:35.331
You stay here.

46:47.643 --> 46:48.976
Give me the gun, Ben.

47:13.001 --> 47:15.270
You never listen to me, James?

47:22.644 --> 47:23.847
Chinese.

47:27.048 --> 47:29.885
Well he did to us like a hot knife in butter, did not he?

47:31.086 --> 47:32.121
Did you lose one?

47:34.090 --> 47:36.259
Could not find a body when the sun comes up.

47:37.425 --> 47:39.352
I Wolves were clearly '.

47:39.362 --> 47:41.865
Well you're tracker, it was wolves or not?

47:45.067 --> 47:46.125
Long after Seein what I saw,

47:46.135 --> 47:48.137
was not going to stick around to find out.

47:50.405 --> 47:52.275
How is it that you're still alive?

47:53.541 --> 47:56.112
Well, he wanted me to deliver a message.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.282
Which is?

48:02.451 --> 48:04.420
I think you're lookin 'at it.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.279
If you'd just listened to me

48:08.289 --> 48:11.149
and let me take Danny and Frank to hunt this man down

48:11.159 --> 48:13.018
We would not be having this conversation

48:13.028 --> 48:15.028
with a half-wit tracker.

48:16.199 --> 48:19.024
Well, you are certainly right about that, boy.

48:19.034 --> 48:21.003
You would not be having this conversation,

48:21.704 --> 48:23.039
because you'd be dead.

48:23.739 --> 48:24.673
Did you talk to him?

48:26.541 --> 48:28.478
Well, more accurately, he spoke to me,

48:30.179 --> 48:34.483
and he told me to stop him.

48:40.255 --> 48:42.356
Then I think that your services

48:43.092 --> 48:44.559
no longer needed.

48:48.463 --> 48:49.364
Add it away.

48:50.331 --> 48:51.199
Not.

48:58.239 --> 48:59.942
You will join us for supper.

49:01.443 --> 49:03.701
We need to talk about the details of what you saw.

49:03.711 --> 49:07.684
The more I know about this man, the better.

49:09.385 --> 49:11.020
Well, I appreciate that, sir.

49:12.221 --> 49:13.523
But you know, I've done my job.

49:14.556 --> 49:15.613
In getting the best.

49:15.623 --> 49:16.549
No.

49:16.559 --> 49:17.226
I insist.

49:20.362 --> 49:21.697
Kinda figured you would.

49:48.123 --> 49:49.424
To your health.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.536
You seem a little nervous, tracker.

50:06.407 --> 50:07.275
Well.

50:12.547 --> 50:14.149
A bit tired I guess.

50:17.418 --> 50:19.321
What can you tell us about this man?

50:25.393 --> 50:26.819
Where you want me to start?

50:26.829 --> 50:30.666
Start with something that will help us find him and kill him.

50:33.302 --> 50:36.162
Well I can tell from what I've seen,

50:36.172 --> 50:37.206
that will not be easy.

50:39.742 --> 50:41.477
But I guess you already know that.

50:42.878 --> 50:44.213
That's why I'm here.

50:50.585 --> 50:52.354
Do you think he will ever stop?

50:58.360 --> 50:59.695
When he is dead.

51:03.532 --> 51:04.467
Sit down.

51:05.733 --> 51:06.400
Sit down.

51:07.902 --> 51:09.371
We will listen to him.

51:14.577 --> 51:15.645
Will you stop, boy?

51:18.213 --> 51:19.081
Do you want to quit?

51:22.985 --> 51:25.778
Would you if they tried to rape your wife pregnant?

51:25.788 --> 51:27.346
Would you?

51:27.356 --> 51:28.147
How about they beat her to death

51:28.157 --> 51:29.848
with their bare hands, boy?

51:29.858 --> 51:31.249
Huh?

51:31.259 --> 51:33.986
How about they took away your future, you would, would you?

51:33.996 --> 51:36.298
Someone tried to rape your wife pregnant?

51:37.465 --> 51:38.300
Would ya?

51:42.637 --> 51:43.672
Excuse us.

51:48.510 --> 51:49.679
Little pussy.

51:51.646 --> 51:54.240
Go in there.

51:54.250 --> 51:55.341
I did not know!

51:55.351 --> 51:57.642
What do you mean you do not know?

51:57.652 --> 51:59.920
Difference it would make if you had known?

52:05.793 --> 52:07.886
I told you before.

52:07.896 --> 52:09.632
It's best to be ready to go all-in.

52:17.706 --> 52:18.841
You is not got the guts.

52:28.449 --> 52:30.418
There's blood on my hands, too.

52:34.422 --> 52:35.290
Forgive me.

52:38.427 --> 52:41.264
You still keep your god!

52:46.735 --> 52:48.403
You think he can save me?

52:53.708 --> 52:54.943
You are more than saving.

53:01.483 --> 53:03.586
But it is my Failin ', not his.

53:08.690 --> 53:09.858
I'm finished with you.

53:48.664 --> 53:50.700
Boy has always been concerned.

53:57.905 --> 54:00.308
Need some God in their lives.

54:02.643 --> 54:03.511
He resists.

54:10.952 --> 54:15.724
After today, and given that I do not trust you,

54:18.594 --> 54:20.396
I think it would be best you left town.

54:25.934 --> 54:28.638
Well I best get a head start on leavin 'time.

54:31.672 --> 54:35.944
I'll go with ya, so you do not change your mind.

55:02.170 --> 55:03.038
Whoa.

55:07.675 --> 55:11.537
It does not look like you brought enough men.

55:11.547 --> 55:13.138
Do not worry about it.

55:13.148 --> 55:14.550
I can get more.

57:23.612 --> 57:24.480
Shh.

57:27.014 --> 57:28.983
I got ya now China boy.

57:31.853 --> 57:34.887
Shoulda picked up the gun the day on the street.

57:45.067 --> 57:48.003
It's a shame that you did so much and accomplished so little.

57:59.146 --> 58:02.107
Come on, let's get out of here.

58:02.117 --> 58:03.952
Run run run run!

58:19.668 --> 58:21.993
Is not safe here, son.

58:22.003 --> 58:23.639
They will be back.

58:24.306 --> 58:25.173
More guns.

58:26.041 --> 58:27.876
And they will keep comin 'back.

58:28.844 --> 58:30.636
I'm counting on it.

58:30.646 --> 58:31.514
You can go.

58:33.914 --> 58:35.985
Oh, I can, I can?

58:39.420 --> 58:42.524
It seems like I've done too much of that already.

58:43.891 --> 58:47.195
And while I appreciate that I had no other place to be.

58:49.931 --> 58:51.534
I do not even know your name.

58:53.434 --> 58:56.271
My dad gave me Christopher King.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.175
But my friends call me Chris.

59:05.947 --> 59:09.018
You know that it is customary that you provide your name back.

59:11.018 --> 59:13.779
Jing Phang.

59:13.789 --> 59:16.222
Well it's a pleasure to meet ya, Jing Phang.

59:18.159 --> 59:19.894
Son of a bitch, son.

59:22.697 --> 59:25.057
Let's get you fixed up.

59:25.067 --> 59:25.934
Come on now.

59:51.726 --> 59:54.252
I think I will like this place.

59:54.262 --> 59:56.888
Your woman as beautiful as this shit hole?

59:56.898 --> 59:59.457
Let me make something clear to you boys.

59:59.467 --> 01:00:00.668
This is my town.

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.029
As long as you're in my town, you will treat my people

01:00:04.039 --> 01:00:06.131
with respect, or you will end up in jail

01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:08.210
or Swingin 'at the end of a rope.

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:17.752
Yes sir, Marshal sir.

01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:20.655
M gonna I regret hirin 'you?

01:00:22.423 --> 01:00:23.826
We will get the job done.

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.128
Okay.

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:30.632
You see something?

01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:39.141
Why only one?

01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:41.143
And.

01:00:42.543 --> 01:00:45.246
It is all you need if there is only one man you want to kill.

01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:47.882
Who you tryin to kill?

01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:51.787
You ask a lot of questions, do not ya?

01:00:58.326 --> 01:01:00.061
I apologize about that, son.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:07.926
How about you, you got family back in China?

01:01:07.936 --> 01:01:10.105
Brothers, sisters?

01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:14.366
No.

01:01:14.376 --> 01:01:15.244
Of?

01:01:17.445 --> 01:01:18.947
Little brother named Porter.

01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:26.387
Mom and Dad died young, so he is more like a son, but

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.759
that the boy's special.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.295
Where is he now?

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:40.134
In a hole, next to her mother and her father.

01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:51.446
This Colt here last bit of him I got.

01:01:54.148 --> 01:01:57.042
And I tell you something, this son of bitch

01:01:57.052 --> 01:01:58.854
woulda shot when it's supposed to,

01:02:01.489 --> 01:02:03.348
Perhaps it would be him Sittin 'on the stage

01:02:03.358 --> 01:02:04.760
with this call.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:13.302
The ball is meant for you, is not it?

01:02:15.871 --> 01:02:18.474
Well I tried to convince this for a while, but

01:02:20.141 --> 01:02:21.876
seems like the bullet had other plans.

01:02:24.246 --> 01:02:25.213
It does not matter, though.

01:02:26.414 --> 01:02:28.050
You can not hide it forever.

01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:32.121
It comes home when it is completed.

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.030
They are all dead.

01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:45.067
He came at us like a wild bobcat.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.436
Took out three of our men.

01:02:50.905 --> 01:02:52.206
I did not sign up for this.

01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:55.176
You say you want to take down one guy.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.370
You're gettin 'paid to do a job.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.315
You do not pay us enough for this.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:04.918
We had an agreement.

01:03:11.992 --> 01:03:13.929
If you do not want to be a fool, Marshal,

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:18.132
I would be to put the gun away and deal with your own problems.

01:03:22.603 --> 01:03:25.296
Well hold on, gentlemen, I will double your ticket.

01:03:25.306 --> 01:03:26.598
Boy.

01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:29.344
I'm Feelin generous, gentlemen, I'll triple it.

01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.117
Now you're talking my kind of language.

01:03:37.452 --> 01:03:38.320
Let's go, boys.

01:03:46.293 --> 01:03:48.986
Where you think you're goin '?

01:03:48.996 --> 01:03:49.864
James?

01:03:57.505 --> 01:04:01.376
I'll end whatyou could not stop.

01:04:03.577 --> 01:04:04.445
No you are not.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.770
You come back to town with me,

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.473
and you come to the church, where you will be safe,

01:04:09.483 --> 01:04:13.243
and where you can ask forgiveness for what you have done.

01:04:13.253 --> 01:04:14.255
Forgiveness?

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.459
From whom God?

01:04:20.128 --> 01:04:22.898
I shoulda stopped yourself, years ago.

01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:28.237
Take your hands off me, man.

01:04:30.237 --> 01:04:34.131
What would your mother think of what you've become?

01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:35.576
You may not talk about her.

01:04:41.215 --> 01:04:45.042
I know what you did when I was a child,

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:46.355
I saw you beat her.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:49.557
You never thought I saw it, huh?

01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:56.530
Every evening after you drank her blood

01:04:57.565 --> 01:04:59.668
stained hands.

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:08.242
Now you can talk about the man I have become.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.946
Well, the apple does not fall far from the tree, right?

01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:18.343
I used to look up to you.

01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:20.322
Damn, I had to, all my life.

01:05:22.356 --> 01:05:25.683
I wanted to be you, I wanted

01:05:25.693 --> 01:05:28.130
Take control as you do.

01:05:29.731 --> 01:05:33.502
But you found God and became

01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:38.572
shell of a man I once worshiped.

01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:44.346
You were weak.

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.000
He will wipe every tear from their eyes.

01:06:39.367 --> 01:06:43.694
There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,

01:06:43.704 --> 01:06:48.210
for the old order of things has passed away.

01:06:49.643 --> 01:06:51.445
Revelation 21: 4th

01:06:57.385 --> 01:06:58.553
Go be with God.

01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:02.724
You've always loved him more than me.

01:07:21.775 --> 01:07:22.643
Let's go.

01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:41.319
No one is here.

01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:42.195
Where the hell are they?

01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:46.661
Let's go, boy.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:01.376
That's perfect.

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:12.542
You are perfect.

01:09:12.551 --> 01:09:13.421
Forever.

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:15.689
Forever.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:40.879
Wake!

01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:48.746
Hmm.

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:50.947
That's it, keep him awake.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.594
I want him to see everything coming.

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:02.571
Nice of you to join us.

01:10:08.576 --> 01:10:12.402
When I say I'm sorry for what happened to your wife,

01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:16.217
know I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

01:10:20.054 --> 01:10:25.260
It's a shame to think of all the fun we could have had

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:30.632
every night she had of been less weak.

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:46.036
My father would have approved of this,

01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:47.948
it is a pity he is not around to see it.

01:10:49.649 --> 01:10:51.943
He would have wanted me though

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:53.588
our little quarrels all by myself.

01:10:57.725 --> 01:11:01.896
But I want you to watch your friend die

01:11:03.597 --> 01:11:05.300
before returning to the dust.

01:11:10.637 --> 01:11:11.939
So let's get right to it.

01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:25.586
There's an old friend.

01:11:27.688 --> 01:11:28.789
I bet you miss.

01:11:29.756 --> 01:11:31.648
Always a joker.

01:11:31.658 --> 01:11:33.394
I admire it, tracker.

01:11:37.097 --> 01:11:37.966
Do it.

01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:19.472
Shoot him!

01:12:22.676 --> 01:12:23.877
Jesus Christ.

01:13:44.824 --> 01:13:46.692
You put the steel back where it belongs.

01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:48.595
Do it.

01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:52.500
Hyah.

01:14:33.873 --> 01:14:34.742
Go up!

01:14:37.944 --> 01:14:38.813
Go up.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.548
Go up!

01:14:57.297 --> 01:14:58.699
Forever.
