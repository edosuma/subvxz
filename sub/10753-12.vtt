00:09.134 --> 00:13.013
I wish you all
the very best of holidays.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.339
Like many, I'll spend the time
in the loving embrace of my family,

00:17.684 --> 00:21.154
which should give us
plenty to talk about in the new year.

00:21.479 --> 00:27.349
Meantime, this is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 talk radio.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.721
Come on. There's a gin and tonic
out there with my name on it.

00:32.031 --> 00:36.787
Father Mike's trying to get everyone
to re-enact the Nativity scene.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.813
We know who can play the ass.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.543
(Barks)

00:43.793 --> 00:47.468
- I'm wearing her down. Who's that for?
- It's for Roz.

00:47.797 --> 00:51.392
"Amazing trick microphone.
Squirts water." Nice.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.027
It's a gag. We don't exchange gifts.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.013
I'm scheduled to do
the noon-to-four slot at Christmas.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.306
Nope.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.677
But my family is getting together
after five years.

01:03.980 --> 01:08.496
- I don't care.
- But my sister and her new baby...

01:08.860 --> 01:13.251
Bulldog, my son Frederick is flying in
to spend the holidays with me.

01:13.615 --> 01:18.211
I have never looked so forward
to a Christmas since I was your size.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.590
- (Shouts) Did you tell him?
- Don't yell.

01:22.874 --> 01:26.310
- You're not giving a traffic report.
- I yelled?

01:26.628 --> 01:29.062
Hey, Doc, you know Bonnie Weems?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.933
I don't, but she does the auto show,
right?

01:32.217 --> 01:36.051
Bonnie drinks more
than she should at these parties,

01:36.388 --> 01:39.346
so the newest
on-air personality drives her home.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.350
- That's you.
- I'd be delighted to drive her home.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.279
She'll be delighted.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.194
(Both laugh)

01:49.984 --> 01:52.054
Merry Christmas.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.330
- Merry Christmas, Dr Crane.
- Oh, merry Christmas, Elizabeth.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.650
I baked you sugar cookies.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.379
Oh, sweets from the sweet.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.452
Do you know who's driving
Bonnie Weems home tonight?

02:06.793 --> 02:09.227
Yes, I am. Can you tell me why...?

02:09.503 --> 02:12.018
Hey, everybody, it's the doc!

02:17.387 --> 02:20.584
Roz, why does everyone
break into hysterics

02:20.890 --> 02:23.404
when I say
I'm driving Bonnie Weems home?

02:23.685 --> 02:25.880
What is that?

02:26.146 --> 02:29.422
Bonnie Weems
is kind of an office legend.

02:29.733 --> 02:34.602
After a few drinks, she gets amorous
and won't take no for an answer.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.944
Is that all? I'm a big boy.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.758
- I can take care of myself.
- OK!

02:40.035 --> 02:43.584
I know we promised not to,
but I was out shopping...

02:43.913 --> 02:47.110
Oh, no. Don't worry.
I couldn't help myself, either.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.851
Oh, no, really? Great.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.120
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, Roz, you shouldn't have.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.414
- Open yours.
- This is just...

02:57.886 --> 03:01.117
Oh, Roz, you really shouldn't have.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.046
- Now it's my turn.
- Oh, don't.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.113
Maybe you should keep it
under the tree.

03:13.401 --> 03:17.838
Me wait to open a Christmas present?
Yeah, right.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.316
Oh, my God, it's great!

03:24.162 --> 03:26.551
It's great because I'm in radio.

03:26.831 --> 03:31.268
- That's what I was going for.
- Thanks a million, Frasier.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.904
Have a happy holiday
and I'll see you next week.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.604
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.048
Dr Crane? I'm Bonnie Weems.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.738
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'll drive you home tonight.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.528
- I'm sorry to put you out.
- No problem.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.771
Enjoy the party.
Tell me when you're ready to go.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.138
I'm ready now, baby!

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:22.804 --> 04:25.762
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles. Merry Christmas.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.491
To what do I owe this occasion?

04:28.768 --> 04:33.000
Nothing. I just stopped by
to get an opinion on a gift for Maris.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.472
It pinches a bit under the arms,

04:35.734 --> 04:38.453
but you be the judge.
Oh, hello, Dr Crane.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.402
Daphne.

04:41.656 --> 04:46.491
Shall I put the little red one back on
so you can make your choice?

04:49.164 --> 04:53.442
- Niles has all the information he needs.
- Fair enough.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.431
Maris and Daphne
are roughly the same size.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.079
Give or take a foot.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.714
Frasier, where you been?

05:13.980 --> 05:18.337
After the Christmas party,
I poured a colleague into a cab,

05:18.693 --> 05:23.847
said a quick prayer for the driver,
dislodged the wedgie of a lifetime...

05:25.408 --> 05:28.047
...then I did some shopping.
Niles, sherry?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.367
- Thank you.
- Santa's going to be good to Frederick.

05:32.707 --> 05:36.461
Bulldog called. He wants you
to take his slot on Christmas.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.504
I've already told him no.
How long will that man nag me?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.769
- What are you doing?
- I'll hang it on the door.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.931
- It's plastic!
- Of course it is.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.693
You think a real one
would have lasted since 1967?

05:54.979 --> 05:58.130
Here you go.
I'm glad to be out of that black one.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.955
I had to take me undies off to zip it up.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.466
Oh, let me get that.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.501
(Phone rings)

06:13.623 --> 06:15.579
Hello? Oh, hi.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.873
- Frasier, for you. It's the nag.
- Oh, Lord.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.329
Bulldog, I already told you that...

06:22.590 --> 06:25.309
Oh... Oh, hello, Lilith.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.664
No, maybe I should, uh...
I'll take this in the bedroom.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.501
Everything set for tomorrow?

06:35.770 --> 06:38.045
Yes, Maris and l
drive to the cabin tonight.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.908
We'll expect you
tomorrow around noon.

06:41.192 --> 06:45.231
- I wish I was coming with you.
- So do I.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.487
(Yelling on the phone)

06:48.742 --> 06:51.210
Oh, shut the hell up, will you?

06:52.370 --> 06:56.409
Daphne, you should come.
We have a traditional Christmas.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.902
It's an actual log cabin
with actual deer grazing in our yard.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.246
Maris fires her gun
to scare them away

07:04.549 --> 07:06.699
from our garbage,
but still it's enchanting.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.038
You can't come?

07:09.304 --> 07:12.694
No, I'll be in San Francisco
with my uncle.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.452
I guess you should be with your family.
It's more traditional.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.728
Except that Jackie is a transvestite.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.876
Getting a bit long in the tooth for it, too,
if you ask me.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.265
Thanksgiving,
he ate too much turkey,

07:27.530 --> 07:31.000
and I had to cut him
out of his pantyhose.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.601
Merry Christmas, everybody?!

07:33.870 --> 07:35.906
- Lilith isn't sending Frederick.
- Why not?

07:36.164 --> 07:40.601
He has this "unique" opportunity
for an "incredible" Christmas.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.838
Her friend has rented
a home in Austria.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.328
- Why not the USA?
- They filmed "The Sound Of Music"

07:48.677 --> 07:51.669
in the house, Freddie's favourite movie.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.884
Julie Andrews is singing there. They're
having dinner with her afterwards.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.296
There's some nonsense

07:58.561 --> 08:02.713
about a horse-driven sleigh ride
and a balloon trip.

08:03.066 --> 08:08.265
Oh, and they're going to spend
an entire day at Euro Disneyland.

08:10.323 --> 08:15.158
At the cabin, there's an old stump
that the local children enjoy kicking.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.563
- You have to let him go.
- Of course I have to let him go.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.028
- Thank God you know what's right.
- I was just making sure you did.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.218
- How would I live without you?
- Now, now. That's enough.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.782
You're being a good father
letting him go.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.203
It need not ruin your Christmas.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.703
Come on,
let's finish decorating the tree.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.967
I got the lights from the storeroom.

08:40.227 --> 08:44.301
Dad, I don't want to use those this year.
I picked up these yesterday.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.993
Chilli peppers?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.315
- They're very fashionable.
- But chilli peppers aren't Christmas!

08:51.614 --> 08:53.969
Neither are Scotch pines
or snow ornaments.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.598
If you want to be technical -
Bethlehem was in the desert.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.871
- Why don't we decorate a palm tree?
- No need for sarcasm!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.961
- I always use those lights!
- Dad...

09:05.253 --> 09:08.928
This is my house!
Can I have one thing the way I want it?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.817
You're upset,
but don't take it out on me.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.483
- Fine. Now you're the psychiatrist?
- I give up.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.797
- Use your chillies!
- Oh, I don't want them any more!

09:19.100 --> 09:23.457
No, go ahead. We could hang radishes!
Put a nice broccoli on top!

09:26.066 --> 09:30.264
- Don't behave this way at the cabin.
- We won't. I'm not going to the cabin!

09:30.612 --> 09:33.922
- Where are you going?
- I'm staying.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.879
- You can't.
- I'll fill in for Bulldog.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.116
- Well, merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

09:39.371 --> 09:41.805
(Both shout)
Merry Christmas!

09:47.253 --> 09:52.202
I didn't realise that working
on Christmas would ruin your plans.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.504
- Please don't be mad.
- What for?

09:55.804 --> 09:58.876
My mother flew in
from Wisconsin to be with me today.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.857
Instead, I'm in this stinking hellhole
on Christmas day,

10:03.186 --> 10:06.337
when only the loneliest
most depressed people would call in!

10:06.648 --> 10:09.367
But look how nice you look for me?!

10:10.610 --> 10:16.401
Try to see it from my position. I couldn't
see my son. I had a fight with my father.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.374
Then I thought,
helping others through their troubles,

10:20.704 --> 10:23.218
may get me through mine.

10:23.498 --> 10:28.572
If we try hard, we can maybe have
the best Christmas we've ever had.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.274
- What do you say?
- OK, I'm not mad. Get ready.

10:33.633 --> 10:38.149
- I need a hug to prove we're friends.
- I am not hugging you, you're grungy.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.823
- Come to Papa. Hug, hug, hug, hug!
- All right!

10:42.142 --> 10:45.737
Yuck, we're friends.
Now, get ready, you're on.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.775
Merry Christmas, Seattle!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.903
This is Dr Crane
coming to you on Christmas Day.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.235
Christmas, that very magical
time of the year

11:00.535 --> 11:04.926
when each moment is as unique
as a snowflake never to be recreated.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.168
Sorry. The news went over.
Do that again.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.479
Merry Christmas, Seattle!

11:12.756 --> 11:18.114
As we head into our second hour,
I'd like to lighten things up a bit.

11:18.511 --> 11:24.347
Ned's told us how he got mugged on
his way home from the soup kitchen.

11:24.768 --> 11:28.727
- Who's next?
- Don wants to tell us about a time

11:29.064 --> 11:31.055
when he was filled with Christmas spirit.

11:31.316 --> 11:35.753
- It's about time. Hello, Don!
- (Don) 'Hello.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.900
'l learned yesterday why this is called
"the season of giving."'

11:40.241 --> 11:45.793
- Then swaddle me in Christmas cheer.
- 'OK. I was driving home.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.484
'l realised, I'd left my favourite
pair of sneakers on the roof of the car.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.588
'l looked back
and saw this homeless guy.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.950
He was already putting them on.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.811
'So I just thought, "What the hell?"
And I kept driving.'

12:05.475 --> 12:08.433
So your experience
of the Christmas spirit would be

12:08.728 --> 12:12.437
that you didn't slam
the car into reverse, speed back there,

12:12.774 --> 12:16.562
and rip your smelly old sneakers
out of a homeless man's hands.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.339
Well, Roz, I think we got
Santa Claus himself on the line?!

12:21.783 --> 12:26.220
(Man) 'I'm sorry. That was the last time.
I'm OK now, I'm really OK.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.298
(Man sobs) 'No, I'm not!'

12:30.333 --> 12:33.086
Barry, I've got to put you on hold

12:33.378 --> 12:38.168
while you pull yourself together.
But stay on the line, I'd like to help you.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.542
'It's all right.
I think I've got a hold of myself.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.394
(Sobs) 'No, I don't!'

12:45.724 --> 12:50.161
(Woman)
'I've fallen in the shower so many times,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.875
'they can't fit any more pins in my hip.'

12:56.985 --> 13:00.102
Gladys, listen,
can I put you on hold for a second?

13:00.405 --> 13:04.364
I have to check on somebody.
How's it going there, Barry?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.100
(Barry sobs)

13:08.371 --> 13:11.443
My sentiments exactly.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.548
(Man)
'It still traumatises me, Dr. Crane.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.306
'l wake up, and I remember
that Christmas morning.

13:18.631 --> 13:23.500
'l walked into my mother's
bedroom crying, and I said, "Mommy!"

13:23.887 --> 13:27.084
"'The puppy Santa gave me
won't wake up."'

13:31.394 --> 13:33.908
OK, Tom. You win the prize

13:34.189 --> 13:38.307
for the saddest
Christmas story we've heard.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.687
Happy holidays.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.064
Roz!

13:46.618 --> 13:48.051
Roz!

13:48.286 --> 13:49.241
(Sobs)

13:49.454 --> 13:51.729
Oh, have you been crying?

13:51.998 --> 13:54.193
Just for the last hour.

13:54.459 --> 13:58.737
Oh, why don't you go home?
I can take over for the next two hours.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.638
- You can't do this.
- Just go home, be with your mom.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.435
Won't it be sadder here all by yourself?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.711
I don't think that's possible.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.964
Well, if you really mean it, I'll go.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.258
I mean it.

14:14.229 --> 14:18.507
But promise me one thing.
Don't sit here and get more depressed.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.975
- You'll see your boy again soon.
- I know.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.031
OK. Hug, hug, hug?

14:27.158 --> 14:30.036
Merry Christmas!

14:30.328 --> 14:32.637
Hi, we're back.

14:32.914 --> 14:37.226
I realise it has been
a pretty tough day for most of you.

14:37.585 --> 14:41.658
I'd like to hear from someone
who's having a good Christmas.

14:42.007 --> 14:46.239
Someone who has maybe learned
a way to beat the holiday blues.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.870
How about it?
Let's take our first call here.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.217
Hello, you're on the air.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.114
(Man)
'Hello, Dr Crane. This is Jeff.'

14:55.395 --> 14:57.989
- Merry Christmas!
- 'Same to you.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.664
'l used to get depressed on Christmas.
Then I found a way to beat it.

15:03.028 --> 15:08.102
'l pop my favourite movie,
"The Sound Of Music", in the VCR.

15:08.491 --> 15:13.645
'Watching Julie Andrews lead those
adorable little tykes through Salzburg,

15:14.039 --> 15:18.191
'nobody could be depressed.
I mean nobody!'

15:19.961 --> 15:22.714
Jeff, are you a betting man?

15:23.465 --> 15:28.220
We're just about out of time.
My, my, this day has flown by.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.508
I wish all of you happy revellers
out there a merry Christmas,

15:32.849 --> 15:36.967
and the others: go out
and treat yourself to something special.

15:37.312 --> 15:42.511
Personally, I'll get myself a meal
at one of Seattle's fine eateries.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.938
I don't know where,
but I promise you one thing...

15:46.237 --> 15:48.512
it'll have a liquor licence.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.241
Just kidding. Don't drink and drive.

15:53.536 --> 15:59.611
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 talk radio.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.645
Thank you.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.668
Merry Christmas. Welcome to "Lou's".

16:39.207 --> 16:41.198
Thank you.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.895
I'm glad you're open. All other places
are closed or booked up.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.124
That makes us so special.

16:49.092 --> 16:53.802
Almost everybody's having
the Christmas platter.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.253
That's a turkey log with mashed
potatoes then Yule log for dessert.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.640
How much more appetising food
becomes when you add the word "log".

17:04.482 --> 17:07.713
I'll just have the Christmas platter.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.939
(Shouts) Platter!

17:11.781 --> 17:14.739
- How you doing?
- OK.

17:15.035 --> 17:18.914
- You having a merry Christmas?
- Now that you ask, no, I'm not.

17:20.290 --> 17:26.205
Can't be with my son, had an argument
over something stupid with my father.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.665
- That's why I'm alone.
- Oh.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.436
And you?

17:30.675 --> 17:34.509
Pretty good. Just yesterday,
I was crossing the street,

17:34.846 --> 17:40.603
and this beautiful pair of sneakers
flew off a car and landed on my feet.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.261
Merry Christmas!

17:45.857 --> 17:47.654
Here you go.

17:47.901 --> 17:52.452
The chef didn't exactly
dally over the remoulade, did he?

17:57.077 --> 17:59.386
Hey, Tim, merry Christmas!

17:59.663 --> 18:02.257
Hey, Bill, glad you could make it.

18:02.540 --> 18:06.658
Hey, how's that turkey platter?
Good as last year's?

18:07.003 --> 18:09.437
I'm not sure this isn't last year's.

18:10.882 --> 18:15.000
- Huh?
- I'm done. Please take this seat.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.303
- Oh, jeez, thanks, pal.
- You bet.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.978
Excuse me.
Something embarrassing happened.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.264
I seem to have lost my wallet.

18:29.526 --> 18:33.280
- You can't pay?
- Oh, no. I can pay.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.208
I must have left it at the office.
I can just go and get it.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.002
- Mm-hm.
- It's all right. This one's on me.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.720
You don't understand, I...

18:42.998 --> 18:47.594
- It's OK, we've all been there.
- But I really did misplace my wallet.

18:47.961 --> 18:52.637
I know you did and Bill here
misplaced his Wall Street portfolio.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.802
- Here, Bill, help me out.
- Oh, no, no.

18:59.139 --> 19:04.930
Hey, everybody, let's help a poor man
get a nice Christmas dinner. Come on.

19:05.353 --> 19:09.266
- No, please. You don't understand.
- It doesn't matter, even pennies.

19:09.607 --> 19:14.556
I make a very decent living, I really do.
This is not necessary.

19:14.946 --> 19:18.985
Well, I...I must say
I've never been so touched in my life.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.318
To think that you would give up
your money which you can ill afford

19:22.620 --> 19:25.657
to help out a fellow human being.

19:25.957 --> 19:30.155
- There you go.
- Gee, I'm so embarrassed.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.563
Look at it this way.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.149
The rest of the year belongs to the rich

19:36.426 --> 19:39.941
with their fancy houses,
expensive foreign cars.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.929
But Christmas...

19:44.184 --> 19:49.816
- Christmas belongs to guys like us.
- Right.

19:50.231 --> 19:55.066
I never will forget this Christmas.
Thank you. Thank you all. Thanks.

20:22.305 --> 20:26.184
Hey!
Somebody lose a set of car keys?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.605
Hey, we're not buying you dessert.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.537
No, you see, I forgot, uh...

21:04.806 --> 21:07.366
- What?
- Uh...

21:08.601 --> 21:10.512
To wish you a merry Christmas.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.249
(All)
Merry Christmas.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.278
- Thanks.
- Hey, bud!

21:17.569 --> 21:21.562
Since you're here,
go call your old man.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.374
Thank you. I think I will.

21:42.761 --> 21:46.834
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:48.433 --> 21:49.661
# Quite stylish

21:49.893 --> 21:55.570
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

21:57.108 --> 22:00.783
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:02.989 --> 22:05.264
# They're calling again #

22:05.533 --> 22:07.285
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
