Iris died,

20:20.960 --> 20:24.931

22:18.920 --> 22:21.241
Why start now?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.085

Please!

23:03.560 --> 23:04.641

23:06.320 --> 23:09.642
You promised her
that you would be there for Joe.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.806
You don't understand.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.407
I don't understand what,
that you abandoned him?

23:15.080 --> 23:17.651
That you abandoned him and everybody else?
You made a promise!

23:17.880 --> 23:18.927
That I couldn't keep!

23:19.800 --> 23:22.724
Not after everything I'd lost.
I was just as broken as Joe was!

23:22.960 --> 23:24.291
- I don't care.
-You will!

23:24.720 --> 23:25.721
(SCOFFING) You...

23:26.480 --> 23:27.481
You Will.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.764
You want answers, Barry?

23:32.640 --> 23:33.766
How's this?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.411
You will go back.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.161
You will do everything
that you can think of to save her.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.164
You're even gonna create time
remnants of yourself,

23:40.400 --> 23:41.811
but he's gonna kill them all, mostly.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.243
And then on the night of May 23rd,

23:46.440 --> 23:48.522
Iris West will die in your arms.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.290
- No.
-And in that moment,

23:50.480 --> 23:52.369
when she takes her last breath,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.764
it'll feel like an eternity.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.205
And it will break you.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.849
She's the love of your life, Barry.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.807
She was the love of my life.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.044
There'll be nothing left at all
but stopping Savitar.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.564
So, no, you won't be there for Joe.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.846
<i>You won't be there
when Caitlin becomes Killer Frost,</i>

24:29.040 --> 24:32.044
<i>when Savitar destroys Wally.</i>

24:33.000 --> 24:34.843
<i>You won't be there for any of them.</i>

24:35.680 --> 24:37.409
But then, one day, you'll stop him.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.881
You'll lock him
in the Speed Force forever.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.205
But at that point,

24:45.320 --> 24:46.651
he already won.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.561
Because everything that you've ever loved
is gone,

24:51.520 --> 24:52.760
<i>including you.</i>

24:56.840 --> 24:58.410

25:17.600 --> 25:19.887

25:23.760 --> 25:25.250

25:25.440 --> 25:26.965
He's not gonna help me, man. He's broken.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.931
And if Caitlin's working with Savitar,
I need to get back. I need...

25:30.600 --> 25:31.931
Before she's lost to us forever.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.202
But what about everyone else?
Don't you wanna help them?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.606
I can't help them!

25:37.640 --> 25:38.801

25:39.600 --> 25:40.965
No matter what I do,

25:41.800 --> 25:43.609
you're gonna abandon

25:45.040 --> 25:47.964

I can't stay here.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.971

Yeah.

I may not be able to use my powers,
but I still know something about tech.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.889
Baby, you're a rock star.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.650
Just like to shine for my man.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.681
Yeah, I don't know.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.680
<i>It looks a little tacky from over here,</i>

31:16.040 --> 31:18.805
but I am old-fashioned.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.649
We told you to stay away, Flash.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.845
Yeah, well, I try not to listen
to criminals, or stupid people.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.971
You guys hearing me all right?

31:34.280 --> 31:35.884
Yeah, Barr, I can hear you loud and clear.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.531
Man, it's good to be back.

31:43.160 --> 31:46.164
Well, that's... What the...
This is not...

31:46.440 --> 31:48.329
- What... What are you doing?
-I just...

31:48.920 --> 31:50.206
- I had a...
-What are you looking for?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.925
I just... I found... Oh.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.961
Now I'm ready.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.011
Should've done as you were told, Flash.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.330
It's two versus one.
Odds aren't in your favor.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.801
I'll take that bet.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.287
Give him a little ride, hon.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.481
With pleasure.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.321
(CHUCKLES)

32:33.080 --> 32:34.411
Okay, that's new.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.526
- He can't move.
-They're using their powers

32:45.720 --> 32:47.165
-at the same time.
-What are we gonna do?

32:47.400 --> 32:48.401
Can't he phase or something?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.204
- That doesn't work on these guys.
-Well, what will?

32:50.440 --> 32:51.521
Give me that thing in your hands.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.446
The other thing.

32:53.720 --> 32:54.926
That makes more sense.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.129
I can rejigger this
to mimic the resonance fields

32:57.320 --> 32:59.561
from Scudder's portals, make it
so Barry can manipulate the mirrors.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.091
- But what about Top?
-This will also restore

33:01.280 --> 33:02.611
whatever rarefaction affect she's causing.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.847
JULIAN: Yes, Cisco, that's brilliant.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.806
But without opening another breach,

33:06.040 --> 33:07.769
how could we possibly get it
into his hands in time?

33:10.360 --> 33:11.600
<i>FUTURE BARRY: I'll take it t0 him.</i>

33:14.160 --> 33:16.208
I saw what you were doing
from the time vault.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.529
You need help. Give it to me.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.921
Go.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.606
(GRUNTS)

33:41.800 --> 33:43.928
I thought it was about time
I did something.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.969
Cisco made it.
Now her powers won't affect us,

33:54.720 --> 33:56.085
and we can go anywhere he does.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.766
(CHUCKLES)

34:00.200 --> 34:02.407
Well, the odds seem pretty even now, huh?

34:03.840 --> 34:05.729
Go. Go.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.001
You mind?

34:11.600 --> 34:12.647
Be my guest.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.880
(GROANING)

34:37.320 --> 34:38.367
Got you.

<i>In a bizarre twist and the first sighting

34:56.560 --> 35:00.087

35:18.520 --> 35:21.091
- Team Flash, back at it again.
-(LAUGHING) Yeah!

35:21.960 --> 35:24.042
I think this was a good first step, Cisco,

35:24.240 --> 35:26.049
but, yeah, we have a ways to go.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.847
Especially me.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.086
I heard what you said.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.767
And you were right,

35:32.320 --> 35:33.560
Iris wouldn't have wanted this.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.202
<i>She would've wanted us to stay</i> a <i>family.</i>

35:38.440 --> 35:39.805
<i>I broke that promise to her,</i>

35:40.480 --> 35:41.527
to all of you.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.331
You made me realize,
even though Savitar is gone,

35:45.760 --> 35:47.205
I've still been letting him win.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.686
<i>I was wrong to do that.</i>

35:50.760 --> 35:52.250
And if you're all willing

35:53.880 --> 35:55.325
to try to be a family again,

35:56.800 --> 35:57.926
I think I can, too.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.401
I don't know which...

36:04.760 --> 36:06.205
Which one of you to hug first.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.287
Him.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.845
(CHUCKLES)

36:16.440 --> 36:19.410
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm in.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.370
H.R., what do you say?

36:21.560 --> 36:23.722
Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings
and some book readings.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.241
Lot of women left to charm, but I'm in.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.487
You know what?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.848
Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters!

36:30.080 --> 36:32.208
Maybe 10% off. On me, let's go!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.961
Thank you.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.926
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

36:52.920 --> 36:53.887
Thank you.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.491
I know how hard this must be.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.449
No, you don't. Not yet.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.087
That's the problem.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.921
And neither of us can change
what's gonna happen.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.968
I wish I could help you. Believe me, I do.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.489
<i>But you trapped Samar

37:09.680 --> 37:10.841
Just tell me how you did it.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.730
- I had help.
-Help from who?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.440
A physicist. Her name is Tracy Brand.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.844
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.491
Why wouldn't you tell me this before?

37:22.680 --> 37:26.127
Because she didn't figure out
the technology until four years ago.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.170
Four years after Iris died.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.481
Mmm-hmm.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.770
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

37:38.360 --> 37:39.361
Hang on.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.808
- I don't know where she is...
-(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

37:55.040 --> 37:56.849
...and I don't understand anything
that's on here.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.329
But that's got all her information on it.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.486
Maybe when you go back,
you can find her, and...

38:03.400 --> 38:05.402
I don't know,
she could decipher it for you.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.569
- I hope so.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:08.040 --> 38:09.121
But if not...

38:13.120 --> 38:15.202
Just make some good memories with Iris.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.002
Hold onto them as tight as you can.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.447
Good luck.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.971
CISCO: Weird.
Feels just like <i>Back</i> to the Future,

38:37.040 --> 38:38.246
No, I will not.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.410

38:48.560 --> 38:50.847
You're too good of a superhero
to lose those powers.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.321

-(SIGHS)

39:11.280 --> 39:12.327
Wait. Did you...

39:12.600 --> 39:16.286
- Did it not work? Do we need to try again?
-No, lwent. I'm back.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.280
You're back?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.691
I went to the future.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.086
How far?

39:23.280 --> 39:24.486
Eight years from now.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.804
I needed to talk to myself
and find out who Savitar was.

39:28.920 --> 39:29.967
Did you?

39:30.280 --> 39:31.247
No.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.965
But I got a lead, something we can use.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.491
Something that'll help us stop him.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.688
Right.
Did you learn anything about Caitlin?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.210
She aligned herself with Savitar.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.446
Why would she do that?

39:44.960 --> 39:45.927
I don't know,

39:46.120 --> 39:48.771
but we need to find her
before she's lost to us forever.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.691
All right, I'll get 110 CCPD.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.009
Yeah. And we'll...
We'll dive in here, right?

Turn me back into Caitlin Snow?

41:25.080 --> 41:26.127
No.
