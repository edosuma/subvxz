00:02.806 --> 00:04.509
In the high-end editorial
world,boxing is so trendy.

00:04.509 --> 00:07.081
And I'm so excited

00:07.081 --> 00:08.349
because I will be
shooting with you today.

00:08.349 --> 00:10.588
You all have
to out-supermodel

00:10.588 --> 00:13.260
the supermodel.

00:13.260 --> 00:14.295
- Make yourself tall.
- Great. Great. Great.

00:14.295 --> 00:17.368
Get ugly.nPowerful face.

00:17.368 --> 00:20.140
This is like so terrible.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.677
Kyle:
Marissa is really hot
and really attractive.

00:21.677 --> 00:23.781
<i>I see something
in Marissa</i>

00:23.781 --> 00:25.451
that I don't see
in myself.

00:25.451 --> 00:27.121
( murmurs )

00:27.121 --> 00:29.560
Congratulations...

00:29.560 --> 00:31.462
<i>Kyle.</i>

00:31.462 --> 00:32.632
I'm sorry, Krislian.

01:22.999 --> 01:26.172
<i>Aw, Kris.</i>

01:26.172 --> 01:26.873
I'm gonna miss
my bunk buddy.

01:29.780 --> 01:31.516
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:33.554 --> 01:35.257
Being in the bottom three
was embarrassing.

01:35.257 --> 01:37.696
<i>If I keep
riding through
the middle,</i>

01:37.696 --> 01:38.932
<i>they're gonna get bored,
and I'm gonna go home.</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:40.902
You guys
better watch out.

01:40.902 --> 01:41.838
I'm never gonna be
in the bottom three

01:41.838 --> 01:43.708
ever again in my life.

01:43.708 --> 01:45.443
I plan for this week
to be quite lit.

01:45.443 --> 01:48.016
- You're the comeback kid,
boo. - Comeback kid.

01:48.016 --> 01:50.387
It's just time
to get model serious.

01:50.387 --> 01:52.893
Last week
I was in the bottom two,
and that sucks.

01:52.893 --> 01:57.235
<i>I don't wanna be
distracted by</i>

01:57.235 --> 01:58.537
<i>a situation between
Marissa and I.</i>

01:58.537 --> 02:00.708
I'm trying to win.

02:00.708 --> 02:02.244
- Everyone was rooting for
you! - We were rooting for you.

02:02.244 --> 02:05.450
Together:
We were all rooting for you!

02:05.450 --> 02:08.122
<i>I had a huge space
in the closet</i>

02:08.122 --> 02:10.260
that I shared with Paige,
and it's a nice area.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.265
And I would say
take that before Binta does.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.268
- Enough said.
- Kyle: <i>Enough said.</i>

02:14.268 --> 02:17.809
I've worked my ass off
to have some space,

02:17.809 --> 02:19.747
<i>and wiggle room in this
house, so ended up moving</i>

02:19.747 --> 02:21.884
<i>just a bunch of stuff.</i>

02:21.884 --> 02:23.654
This is totally
my claimed half of the--

02:23.654 --> 02:26.459
of the ( bleep ) closet.

02:26.459 --> 02:27.829
No, I am.
I just put my ( bleep ).

02:31.102 --> 02:32.906
I just put
my ( bleep ) in there.

02:32.906 --> 02:34.342
- I just moved.
- Okay.

02:34.342 --> 02:35.945
I know you have
all kinds of...

02:35.945 --> 02:38.182
No, I just put
my ( bleep ) in there,

02:38.182 --> 02:39.919
- and you're not moving it. -
<i>Well, I was looking at
that...</i>

02:39.919 --> 02:41.524
Okay, you were looking
at it before I put
my ( bleep ) in it.

02:41.524 --> 02:43.193
It doesn't matter.
I put my ( bleep ) in it.

02:43.193 --> 02:44.596
<i>Okay, I can have
a attitude,</i>

02:44.596 --> 02:45.932
and you're not
gonna do nothing about it.

02:45.932 --> 02:46.265
And that is where
it will stay.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.111
Marissa is like
the annoying little sister
that I never wanted.

02:52.111 --> 02:54.649
<i>She's super confident.</i>

02:54.649 --> 02:56.285
<i>She gives off
this aggressive attitude,</i>

02:56.285 --> 02:57.622
<i>and she does
exactly what she wants.</i>

02:57.622 --> 03:00.628
Ugh!
Stop ( bleep ) talking!

03:00.628 --> 03:02.464
I about
to leave with this
big-ass fat-ass baby.

03:04.168 --> 03:06.172
<i>Guys, Rita alert.</i>

03:08.778 --> 03:11.650
<i>Get your booty down here.</i>

03:11.650 --> 03:12.384
Hi, ladies.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.392
So, since coming here,
you've improved your walks

03:16.392 --> 03:18.363
and learned how to look
gorgeous in motion.

03:18.363 --> 03:22.204
Can you keep a beat?
Good luck.

03:22.204 --> 03:24.475
- Oh, ho! Dancing.
- Dancing.

03:24.475 --> 03:27.649
<i>Girls...</i>

03:27.649 --> 03:28.550
The single dance move.

03:31.388 --> 03:33.026
( all laughing )

03:33.026 --> 03:35.230
I was a competitive dancer
for 12 years.

03:35.230 --> 03:37.301
<i>I did everything
from jazz, tap, lyrical,</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:39.238
<i>hip-hop--
you name it--
I did it.</i>

03:39.238 --> 03:41.376
<i>Never had a day off.</i>

03:41.376 --> 03:42.746
<i>It was like training
for the Olympics.</i>

03:42.746 --> 03:44.649
So I'm feeling
super confident.

03:44.649 --> 03:44.983
Do you know what I
thinknthe bag of tricks is?

03:47.855 --> 03:49.024
Alternating the arms
going this way.

03:49.024 --> 03:50.528
( all laughing )

03:56.907 --> 04:01.315
- Hi, ladies.
- All: Stacey!

04:01.315 --> 04:03.988
Come on in.
Come on in.

04:03.988 --> 04:06.359
Great to see you
all again,

04:06.359 --> 04:07.929
and congratulations on
still being here.

04:07.929 --> 04:09.699
It's pretty common
for models

04:09.699 --> 04:11.402
to stiffen up on posing
or walking the runway.

04:11.402 --> 04:13.541
I want you to meet someonewhose
business is movement.

04:13.541 --> 04:16.345
Chris Grant,

04:16.345 --> 04:18.016
Beyoncé's personal
choreographer...

04:18.016 --> 04:20.722
- Oh.
- ...an amazing
dancer himself,

04:20.722 --> 04:23.059
<i>he took a quick break from
Beyoncé's Formation tour</i>

04:23.059 --> 04:24.763
to come and
help us out today.

04:24.763 --> 04:27.535
Coryanne:
This is a legend,
obviously.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.204
Queen B, she learns her
dances that she performs
onstage,

04:29.204 --> 04:31.042
you know, from him,
so I'm excited.

04:31.042 --> 04:33.412
I love dancing, I love music.
I'm ready.

04:33.412 --> 04:35.216
Hey, ladies.
Dance is modeling
with movement, basically.

04:35.216 --> 04:38.557
<i>If you break down
each move a dancer does,</i>

04:38.557 --> 04:41.295
<i>each one can be translated
as a model pose.</i>

04:41.295 --> 04:44.268
So Stacey and I is here
to teach you

04:44.268 --> 04:46.238
how to loosen up,
but still keeping the model.

04:46.238 --> 04:48.142
I'm gonna
teach you guys a routine,
first I'm gonna show it.

04:48.142 --> 04:49.144
All right,
so here we go.

05:07.582 --> 05:12.224
( all cheering )

05:12.224 --> 05:15.330
All right, ladies,
are you ready to learn

05:15.330 --> 05:17.000
- a routine, yes?
- ( all cheering )

05:17.000 --> 05:19.305
India:
I'm not the best
freestyle dancer,

05:19.305 --> 05:20.340
but I think
if I'm given choreography,
I can handle it.

05:20.340 --> 05:22.912
I'm an athlete.

05:22.912 --> 05:24.849
All right,
so here we go.

05:24.849 --> 05:25.818
So the first move
I want to start with
is, five, six,

05:25.818 --> 05:29.526
seven, eight.

05:29.526 --> 05:31.429
Tatiana:
So today we have to basically
remain modelesque

05:31.429 --> 05:33.801
- while being in motion.
- Two, three, click, click.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.174
So that's a pose.
Treat this as a pose.

05:37.174 --> 05:39.345
Tatiana:
I immediately looked over
at Paige because,

05:39.345 --> 05:40.749
<i>I mean, she is the
competitive dancer,</i>

05:40.749 --> 05:42.953
but she screams
more like musical theater,

05:42.953 --> 05:44.990
<i>like Broadway.</i>

05:44.990 --> 05:46.593
I don't think that
she screams "model" to me.

05:46.593 --> 05:48.765
One, two, three, four.
Good but don't rush.

05:48.765 --> 05:53.106
Stacey:
Now remember, you're a model
first and foremost.

05:53.106 --> 05:55.945
<i>So watch your face,
watch your posture,
watch your body.</i>

05:55.945 --> 05:58.817
Paige:
<i>I definitely feel like
I have a leg up,</i>

05:58.817 --> 06:00.454
<i>and I'm dancing with
Beyoncé's choreographer.</i>

06:00.454 --> 06:03.193
Like, this is just such
a dream come true.

06:03.193 --> 06:05.163
What I love about you
is that you're adding

06:05.163 --> 06:05.998
a lot of your own "isms"
because you were a dancer,

06:05.998 --> 06:08.937
- right?
- Yeah.

06:08.937 --> 06:09.973
<i>I'm thinking
I have this in the bag.</i>

06:09.973 --> 06:12.211
Seven and eight
and pose.

06:12.211 --> 06:14.181
Great.

06:14.181 --> 06:15.150
It's time
for your challenge.

06:15.150 --> 06:18.323
I feel sorry for you guys.

06:18.323 --> 06:20.995
( laughing )
No, no, no.

06:20.995 --> 06:23.333
You guys all have
ten minutes

06:23.333 --> 06:26.072
to each come up with
your own signature moves

06:26.072 --> 06:28.877
- to end the routine.
- There's like four counts.

06:28.877 --> 06:30.515
Marissa:
I don't have any experience
coming up with dance moves.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.153
I have experience with
ass shaking

06:33.153 --> 06:36.025
<i>at parties in clubs
or whatever,</i>

06:36.025 --> 06:37.494
but I don't have any type
of professional lessons.

06:37.494 --> 06:39.733
Think model.
Your ten minutes
starts now.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.574
Good luck.

06:43.574 --> 06:46.680
<i>Being second or third
in a challenge</i>

06:46.680 --> 06:48.483
literally means
nothing.

06:48.483 --> 06:50.588
Chris:
Make it good.
Make it hot.

06:50.588 --> 06:52.424
It wasn't easy choreography,
and I'm not a dancer,

06:52.424 --> 06:54.896
<i>but I'm paying attention
and just putting</i>

06:54.896 --> 06:57.067
<i>my best effort in.</i>

06:57.067 --> 06:58.771
<i>I hope I can
stand out this week.</i>

06:58.771 --> 07:01.242
Chris:
<i>Don't think you have
to step so much.</i>

07:01.242 --> 07:04.582
It's literally
like right here.

07:04.582 --> 07:06.252
Paige:
I feel like I have
the dance down pat,

07:06.252 --> 07:08.524
but looking around
at the other girls,

07:08.524 --> 07:09.559
they're definitely making
me a little bit nervous.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.732
Nice. Nice.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.867
Paige:
<i>Because somebody can pull out
some good moves</i>

07:13.867 --> 07:16.038
<i>out of nowhere,</i>

07:16.038 --> 07:17.408
so we'll have to see
how it goes.

07:17.408 --> 07:20.714
Okay, ladies,
your ten minutes are up.

07:20.714 --> 07:23.353
- Chris: Great job.
Great job.
- Great job, ladies.

07:23.353 --> 07:26.125
Each of you
will perform the choreography
Chris taught you

07:26.125 --> 07:28.564
<i>and finish it with your own
signature move.</i>

07:28.564 --> 07:30.602
First up is Tatiana.
Show us what you got.

07:30.602 --> 07:33.239
<i>( music playing )</i>

07:33.239 --> 07:36.913
It's there.
It's there.

07:36.913 --> 07:38.917
Cody:
Tatiana is doing
really well.

07:38.917 --> 07:39.786
It seems like
she's kinda in her element.

07:39.786 --> 07:42.592
Six.
There you go.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.127
Stacey:
<i>Tatiana, she walked like
a model.</i>

07:44.127 --> 07:46.265
<i>She moved her body
like a model.</i>

07:46.265 --> 07:47.100
What we wanted them to do,
she did exactly that.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.570
<i>( song ends )</i>

07:48.570 --> 07:50.575
Marissa.

07:50.575 --> 07:52.077
Okay.

07:54.281 --> 07:56.452
Seven, eight.

07:56.452 --> 07:59.391
A little more powerful.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.163
<i>I just felt that she didn't
take it seriously.</i>

08:02.163 --> 08:05.002
Now's the time
to give your best.

08:05.002 --> 08:06.840
<i>And don't laugh
and don't take it as a joke</i>

08:06.840 --> 08:08.744
because you're only
hurting yourself.

08:08.744 --> 08:09.344
Think about
what you're doing.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.621
- Don't rush.
- Oh, man.

08:13.621 --> 08:17.027
I'm sorry.

08:17.027 --> 08:19.131
I think the thing is
a lot of the girls

08:19.131 --> 08:20.601
they were thinking too
much about the actual moves

08:20.601 --> 08:23.139
<i>as a dancer,
but the challenge</i>

08:23.139 --> 08:24.909
<i>wasn't for them
to be a dancer.</i>

08:24.909 --> 08:26.613
It was for them
to be a model.

08:26.613 --> 08:29.519
Next up,
Kyle.

08:29.519 --> 08:32.123
Kyle:
<i>I don't know if I'm the most
balanced person</i>

08:32.123 --> 08:34.261
in or out of heels,
but I'm just gonna do Kyle

08:34.261 --> 08:37.702
and see if that
outshines the pack.

08:37.702 --> 08:41.442
There we go.
Twist, step, step.

08:41.442 --> 08:44.015
Let your bodynaturally
go to the side.

08:44.015 --> 08:46.486
Marissa:
<i>Oh, my God.
Kyle is a mess.</i>

08:46.486 --> 08:48.824
Her body doesn't really
move like a hip-hop dancer.

08:48.824 --> 08:50.828
<i>She can't keep a beat,</i>

08:50.828 --> 08:51.696
and she's just
absolutely terrible.

08:51.696 --> 08:53.734
Oh, dear God.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.506
<i>Choreography
is really hard.</i>

08:56.506 --> 08:59.645
<i>I'm always
one beat behind,</i>

08:59.645 --> 09:00.480
which is very frustrating,
but I'm also not a quitter.

09:02.619 --> 09:03.787
There's a lot
of dip-it-low aspects
to this routine.

09:07.695 --> 09:11.836
Chris:
Make sure your back still
looks good on six.

09:11.836 --> 09:14.408
Courtney:
<i>And because of scoliosis</i>

09:14.408 --> 09:15.911
I am stiff-backed
and can't really dip it low.

09:15.911 --> 09:19.018
<i>But I did my best.</i>

09:19.018 --> 09:22.023
Chris:
Go, one, two, three, four.

09:22.023 --> 09:26.065
Stay connected.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.869
- Stacey: Yeah, much
better. - Chris: Much better.

09:27.869 --> 09:29.706
Tatiana:
<i>India, she's not a dancer
at all,</i>

09:29.706 --> 09:31.810
<i>and for her to grow so much
in a short period of time,</i>

09:31.810 --> 09:33.847
I feel like
she's definitely good
competition to watch.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.984
Stacey:
<i>Looking good.</i>

09:35.984 --> 09:37.755
Last but not least,
Paige.

09:37.755 --> 09:40.360
<i>Show us what
you got, girl.</i>

09:40.360 --> 09:42.665
I'm feeling still pretty
confident in myself...

09:42.665 --> 09:45.170
Pop, pop--
nice-- one, two.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.240
Paige:
I won the challenge
last week

09:47.240 --> 09:49.044
so I'm keeping fingers crossed
that I could win again.

09:49.044 --> 09:50.881
Chris:
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom. Nice.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.720
Stacey:
Paige has a dance background
and it's obvious,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.089
<i>but Paige
just needs to stop doing this
thing with her face,</i>

09:55.089 --> 09:56.391
this lip thing--
this duck face.

09:57.962 --> 09:59.397
- ( song ends )
- Chris: <i>Great job.</i>

10:02.337 --> 10:04.074
Stacey:
<i>What? What?</i>

10:04.074 --> 10:07.180
All right, ladies,
so some of you struggled

10:07.180 --> 10:08.684
<i>and some of you
had some pretty good moves.</i>

10:08.684 --> 10:11.590
I think a lot of you got

10:11.590 --> 10:13.459
like kind of lost
in the dance moves

10:13.459 --> 10:15.230
and let me just do the dance
and let me just get through it.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.601
<i>Kyle, you're not
a dancer clearly.</i>

10:17.601 --> 10:19.772
You kind of was looking
a little awkward here and there,

10:19.772 --> 10:21.710
but you stayed
true to you.

10:21.710 --> 10:22.878
It sounds like a
compliment, but I promise you,

10:22.878 --> 10:25.250
that is not a compliment.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.418
It is telling you
that you are a bad dancer

10:26.418 --> 10:28.455
in a nice way.

10:28.455 --> 10:30.426
But, obviously,
there was one person

10:30.426 --> 10:32.599
that stood out
and took our notes.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.267
That person is...

10:34.267 --> 10:37.942
Tatiana.

10:37.942 --> 10:40.648
India:
<i>I don't like to lose over
and over and over again,</i>

10:40.648 --> 10:42.785
<i>but I get it.</i>

10:42.785 --> 10:44.054
Tatiana is the
full package,

10:44.054 --> 10:46.258
business woman,
model, dancer.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.429
What's not to love
about that?

10:48.429 --> 10:49.999
Stacey:
<i>Congratulations, Tatiana.</i>

10:49.999 --> 10:51.937
Your prize is
you're gonna be the new face

10:51.937 --> 10:55.176
of our upcoming campaign
for Gypsy Sport--

10:55.176 --> 10:57.949
<i>a unique line
of luxurious street wear</i>

10:57.949 --> 11:00.019
<i>inspired by and made right
here in New York City.</i>

11:00.019 --> 11:03.594
Thank you so much.
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

11:03.594 --> 11:07.300
I'm so excited.
I mean, their clothes are super,
like, crazy eclectic.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.172
<i>I've never worked with a
brand or company like them,</i>

11:10.172 --> 11:12.812
and I'm just happy
that I won another challenge.

11:12.812 --> 11:14.816
Make sure
you guys practice tonight,
because there's more.

11:14.816 --> 11:17.922
<i>You guys are gonna be using
those same moves</i>

11:17.922 --> 11:20.259
in a Gypsy Sport
fashion video tomorrow.

11:21.596 --> 11:23.032
Today we're gonna be
creating a music video.

11:26.372 --> 11:29.277
Do something on camera.
Do something.

11:29.277 --> 11:30.380
Come on, work with it.
Work with it.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.150
Hit that mark.
Hit that mark.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.654
You're just doing
pretty much the same
thing over and over.

11:33.654 --> 11:35.390
Yeah, 'cause that's what
I plan on doing out there.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.327
He doesn't want
the same thing over and over.

11:37.327 --> 11:38.864
- Of course.
- You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.168
- You're not
showing me anything.
- I'm trying to help you.

11:41.168 --> 11:41.468
You're as good as your
last job. Do not forget that.

11:52.491 --> 11:56.967
Do you want me to help you
with the dance later?

11:56.967 --> 11:59.872
- Please.
- I can, yeah.

11:59.872 --> 12:01.510
I'm just gonna
do it 1,000 times.
Then I'll know it.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.647
Kyle:
<i>Today, the choreography</i>

12:03.647 --> 12:05.049
<i>was something
that I struggled with,</i>

12:05.049 --> 12:06.152
but we still have a chance
to redeem ourselves

12:06.152 --> 12:08.255
tomorrow in a video.

12:08.255 --> 12:09.725
So I've got
some work to do.

12:12.731 --> 12:16.807
Should I do itmore like a step?

12:16.807 --> 12:18.811
- Yeah.
- Like a...

12:18.811 --> 12:21.850
- So no.
- Do whatever
you're comfortable with.

12:21.850 --> 12:24.321
I definitely do need space
as a human being--

12:24.321 --> 12:27.093
as any human being would.

12:27.093 --> 12:29.030
<i>I've made it
very clear to Kyle</i>

12:29.030 --> 12:30.901
<i>that it is light
and it is nothing serious.</i>

12:30.901 --> 12:32.337
<i>'Cause at the end of the day,
it is a competition.</i>

12:32.337 --> 12:34.709
<i>This is about me.</i>

12:34.709 --> 12:35.176
- That's nice.
- I'm just gonna sell it.

12:38.182 --> 12:41.021
- In my eyes.
- Cool.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.459
Paige:
Kyle really seems fixated
on Marissa,

12:43.459 --> 12:46.599
<i>but Marissa doesn't seem like
she's that into it.</i>

12:46.599 --> 12:48.737
<i>She seems like
she's definitely here
for the competition.</i>

12:48.737 --> 12:50.273
<i>And I think that she
just wants to flirt</i>

12:50.273 --> 12:52.210
and have a little fun.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.547
You're trying
to make me laugh
right now.

12:53.547 --> 12:55.016
I was trying
to seduce you,
but fine.

12:55.016 --> 12:55.717
Aye, yai, yai.

12:58.857 --> 13:03.700
Tatiana: <i>I won the
challenge yesterday,</i>

13:03.700 --> 13:05.103
<i>so I feel really good
going into this shoot.</i>

13:05.103 --> 13:06.640
I feel like this
is kind of just proving

13:06.640 --> 13:08.610
how much of a boss I am.

13:08.610 --> 13:09.444
- Hi, how are you today?
- I'm good.

13:12.483 --> 13:14.320
- How are you?
- I'm great.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.957
Coryanne:
So today, we get
to perform again,

13:15.957 --> 13:17.795
<i>and it's like
a video shoot.</i>

13:17.795 --> 13:19.465
I'm so excited,
'cause I want to show them

13:19.465 --> 13:20.934
I did know the moves,
I genuinely did,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.705
and I'm not
gonna mess up again.

13:25.409 --> 13:30.286
- Hi.
- Hello.

13:30.286 --> 13:32.123
- Welcome.
We are in Harlem.
- ( all cheering )

13:32.123 --> 13:35.396
<i>This city is infamous
for its soulful music,</i>

13:35.396 --> 13:38.737
<i>art, and dance.</i>

13:38.737 --> 13:39.806
I really hope you guys
remember everything you learned

13:39.806 --> 13:42.311
from Chris and Stacey

13:42.311 --> 13:43.680
<i>because today
we're gonna be creating</i>

13:43.680 --> 13:45.350
a scene from
a music video,

13:45.350 --> 13:47.253
and the set
is the runway

13:47.253 --> 13:49.124
on this city street.

13:49.124 --> 13:52.263
To guide you through
today's shoot,

13:52.263 --> 13:53.834
we brought the man behind
some of these sickest videos

13:53.834 --> 13:57.006
for Drake, Rihanna,
Iggy, and even me.

13:57.006 --> 14:00.079
- Director X.
- ( all cheering )

14:00.079 --> 14:02.785
Director X:
<i>What's up, y'all?</i>

14:02.785 --> 14:04.087
We got a lot to do today
and not a lot of time,

14:04.087 --> 14:06.827
so the game is gonna be
really real.

14:06.827 --> 14:08.930
He can be a little scary,
but he means well.

14:08.930 --> 14:12.003
But if he needs something,
you better deliver.

14:12.003 --> 14:13.607
<i>I'm very
intimidated by Director X</i>

14:13.607 --> 14:16.612
because I know his work.

14:16.612 --> 14:18.349
He is very, very big
in the music video world.

14:18.349 --> 14:22.124
<i>So a little scary.</i>

14:22.124 --> 14:24.494
For this shoot,
you'll start down the runway

14:24.494 --> 14:26.165
at three interactive
Harlem stories,

14:26.165 --> 14:28.469
posing at each one.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.273
<i>You'll then
end your walk</i>

14:30.273 --> 14:31.943
<i>by doing the dances
that you learned yesterday</i>

14:31.943 --> 14:34.214
followed by your own
individual personality move.

14:34.214 --> 14:36.652
All of your looks,
they're done by my friend,
Rio from Gypsy Sport,

14:36.652 --> 14:39.859
<i>and, Tatiana,
congratulations on becoming</i>

14:39.859 --> 14:42.698
the upcoming face
of the brand.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.636
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

14:44.636 --> 14:45.571
And not to put
anymore pressure on y'all,

14:45.571 --> 14:47.742
but one take, one shot.

14:47.742 --> 14:48.810
For this shoot
we only get one shot,

14:50.982 --> 14:53.252
which is kind of crazy,
especially since

14:53.252 --> 14:56.324
<i>we have to interact</i>

14:56.324 --> 14:57.828
<i>with all of
the different elements.</i>

14:57.828 --> 14:59.666
So I'm feeling
a little nervous.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.036
- Are you guys ready?
- All: Yes.

15:02.036 --> 15:02.971
All right,
back to hair and makeup.

15:04.474 --> 15:05.009
- Hi.
- All: Hello.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.987
- How're you doing?
- All: Good. How are you?

15:10.987 --> 15:12.892
<i>Your outfits are killing it.
How're you feeling?</i>

15:12.892 --> 15:15.096
Music videos
are literally like
your own world.

15:15.096 --> 15:17.935
The director works well

15:17.935 --> 15:19.004
when he like
has something
to work with.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.907
<i>He wants energy.</i>

15:20.907 --> 15:23.111
It's about like
owning that moment.

15:23.111 --> 15:24.749
<i>and it's all about
that connection you have
with the camera.</i>

15:24.749 --> 15:27.854
You know what I mean?

15:27.854 --> 15:29.090
It's like
this is a music video,

15:29.090 --> 15:30.259
you're looking at me,
you know?

15:30.259 --> 15:31.963
And it's all about

15:31.963 --> 15:33.867
just having that
kind of confidence.

15:33.867 --> 15:37.340
<i>All right, I'm heading off
to a photo shoot,</i>

15:37.340 --> 15:38.209
<i>but Stacey McKenzie
will be here shortly
to help you out.</i>

15:38.209 --> 15:41.549
Bye.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.085
India:
Rita gave us some really great
tips on doing video shoots.

15:43.085 --> 15:45.924
She's sharing
her knowledge with us,

15:45.924 --> 15:47.226
<i>and I love
talking to her.</i>

15:47.226 --> 15:49.031
Stacey:
<i>Hi, girls.</i>

15:49.031 --> 15:51.301
<i>Guys, be in front
of a mirror</i>

15:51.301 --> 15:53.272
and, like,
work on your angles

15:53.272 --> 15:55.711
so you see what works
for your face, for your body.

15:55.711 --> 15:57.748
- <i>All right?</i>
- Stacey is, once again,

15:57.748 --> 16:00.920
<i>here to help us.</i>

16:00.920 --> 16:02.891
Remember, I don't want you
to focus too much on a dance

16:02.891 --> 16:04.461
to where you get lost
and it's all about the dance.

16:04.461 --> 16:06.432
The fact
that we have one take

16:06.432 --> 16:08.402
definitely is a little
frightening,

16:08.402 --> 16:10.307
<i>but I'm prepared
to wing it.</i>

16:10.307 --> 16:12.076
How hard can it be?

16:12.076 --> 16:13.479
Marissa,
walk and when you
get to here

16:13.479 --> 16:15.083
show me some poses
that you're gonna do.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.418
Okay.

16:17.220 --> 16:17.654
<i>( Marissa laughs )</i>

16:21.896 --> 16:24.067
You still need
to like practice
so that like--

16:24.067 --> 16:25.136
- Okay, I'll do it.
- No, no, no, get back.

16:25.136 --> 16:27.073
Oh, my gosh.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.077
<i>Stacey, she can be
very overbearing at times.</i>

16:29.077 --> 16:31.082
- She does
just kind of annoy me.
- You want to win this, right?

16:31.082 --> 16:33.285
- <i>Of course, but I feel
like--</i> - You want to win
this?

16:33.285 --> 16:35.089
I feel like this is what
complicates things more for me.

16:35.089 --> 16:37.494
Kyle:
Marissa has a little bit
of a temper,

16:37.494 --> 16:40.433
and she is really
unapologetic about it.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.270
<i>You know, she's
obviously a great model,
but just modeling</i>

16:42.270 --> 16:45.075
<i>is not the only thing
the judges are looking for.</i>

16:45.075 --> 16:46.913
I don't know
what you want me
to do right now,

16:46.913 --> 16:48.449
- to be honest.
-No, right now
I just want you to walk,

16:48.449 --> 16:49.918
get here,
and do some poses.

16:49.918 --> 16:51.488
Simple.
Stop overthinking
so much.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.426
Then recommend
some poses to me please.

16:53.426 --> 16:54.696
No, you're gonna
show me what you got first.

16:54.696 --> 16:56.766
- Okay.
- Paige: <i>Stacey McKenzie.</i>

16:56.766 --> 16:58.035
<i>She's a legend
in this industry,</i>

16:58.035 --> 17:00.139
and anything
that she has to say to me

17:00.139 --> 17:01.943
in terms of advice
I am going to do take

17:01.943 --> 17:05.350
with the utmost seriousness.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.053
You're just doing
pretty much the same thing
over and over.

17:07.053 --> 17:09.792
Yeah, 'cause that's what
I plan on doing out there.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.629
He doesn't want
the same thing
over and over.

17:11.629 --> 17:12.798
- So you have to like--
- Uh-huh, when I start...

17:12.798 --> 17:14.368
No, no, no, no,
listen to me.

17:14.368 --> 17:16.071
Stop telling me
uh-huh, mm-hmm.

17:16.071 --> 17:18.109
- Uh-huh.
- You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

17:18.109 --> 17:20.046
- You're not
showing me anything.
- I'm trying to help you.

17:20.046 --> 17:21.783
Marissa's-- I think
her mouth is gonna

17:21.783 --> 17:22.952
really get her in trouble
in this competition.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.856
Especially in
the real world,

17:24.856 --> 17:26.124
people are not gonna
put up with her barking at them

17:26.124 --> 17:28.295
and saying rude things
for no reason.

17:28.295 --> 17:29.965
That's gonna be her downfall,
and I know it.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.368
You're not giving me
any, like, notes.

17:31.368 --> 17:33.305
You're just making me do
the same thing over and over.

17:33.305 --> 17:34.642
I'm not making you do
the same thing over and over.

17:34.642 --> 17:36.145
You're doing the same
thing over and over.

17:36.145 --> 17:37.881
I know.
That's why I want you
to help me.

17:37.881 --> 17:39.719
But I'm trying to help
you, but you're not listening.

17:39.719 --> 17:41.322
- I'm trying to listen.
- Keep the pretty lips shut,

17:41.322 --> 17:42.558
listen to me,
and let me tell you
exactly what it is

17:42.558 --> 17:45.396
- you need to do.
- Okay.

17:45.396 --> 17:46.566
I don't want to come across
as some bitchy model,

17:46.566 --> 17:49.004
but she was annoying me.

17:49.004 --> 17:51.075
Don't do the hat thing.
I don't want to see it.

17:51.075 --> 17:52.911
Her critiques
were just confusing me
more than anything.

17:52.911 --> 17:56.252
- I don't need to help you, eh?
- <i>I want your help.</i>

17:56.252 --> 17:58.356
- <i>You sure you want my
help?</i> - I promise.

17:58.356 --> 17:59.559
Stacey:
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

17:59.559 --> 18:01.729
I need to talk to you.

18:01.729 --> 18:03.499
If she doesn't make
itnto the next round,

18:03.499 --> 18:05.069
if she doesn't win
this competition...

18:05.069 --> 18:06.338
<i>Not on me,
it's on you, baby.</i>

18:06.338 --> 18:08.342
Oh, God,
that was so bad.

18:08.342 --> 18:08.776
You look bat-(
bleep ) crazy.

18:19.064 --> 18:23.506
Director X: <i>All right,
here we go, guys!</i>

18:23.506 --> 18:27.046
The double Dutch
is happening behind there.

18:27.046 --> 18:29.284
<i>What really
makes a good take</i>

18:29.284 --> 18:31.288
is someone
that hits those marks,
brings good energy.

18:31.288 --> 18:33.191
I like people
that walk into a scenario
and make it theirs.

18:33.191 --> 18:35.797
- Tatiana, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

18:35.797 --> 18:37.066
- You, too.
- I'm good.

18:37.066 --> 18:38.402
Director X
is an amazing director.

18:38.402 --> 18:39.939
Camera comes down and go.
You're walking down.

18:39.939 --> 18:43.111
There is the mark
you're going to.

18:43.111 --> 18:45.083
Tatiana:
It's insane like that we get
to work with such

18:45.083 --> 18:47.319
<i>high caliber directors
and photographers.</i>

18:47.319 --> 18:49.224
I'm so excited
to get to work with
him one-on-one.

18:49.224 --> 18:52.631
See that mark?
The biker comes by...

18:52.631 --> 18:55.135
I'm actually excited that
we have just one take to do it

18:55.135 --> 18:58.242
<i>because I feel like
with this video</i>

18:58.242 --> 18:59.946
<i>you're doing a lot of
spur-of-the-moment activity</i>

18:59.946 --> 19:00.914
so to redo it over and over
it's kind of inorganic.

19:00.914 --> 19:03.485
<i>Action.</i>

19:03.485 --> 19:07.728
Mark. Mark.
Good job.

19:07.728 --> 19:09.264
<i>Tatiana just has it.</i>

19:09.264 --> 19:11.301
Hit it!

19:11.301 --> 19:12.504
Really good energy,
good sense of timing.

19:12.504 --> 19:14.273
<i>There's no real missteps.</i>

19:14.273 --> 19:16.111
And... closer.

19:16.111 --> 19:19.151
- Great job.
- Thank you.

19:19.151 --> 19:20.754
Paige:
<i>So even though I didn't win
the challenge yesterday,</i>

19:20.754 --> 19:24.294
being the dancer
in the group,

19:24.294 --> 19:25.964
I feel super,
super confident.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.466
Director X:
<i>Hit that mark.</i>

19:27.466 --> 19:28.803
Terrific.
Ready to go to the end.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.005
<i>Closer.
Good.</i>

19:35.149 --> 19:39.959
Courtney: <i>When I was
in hair and makeup,</i>

19:39.959 --> 19:42.130
my lips started getting,
like, burny and itchy.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.800
<i>I should've let the
makeup artist know, like,</i>

19:46.673 --> 19:48.609
hey, I'm allergic to nuts,
because she mixed the lipstick

19:48.609 --> 19:51.148
when she went to retouch it
with ChapStick.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.121
Can I just take it off more?

19:54.121 --> 19:55.857
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

19:55.857 --> 19:57.359
- You're allergic to soybean?
- There's almond oil in it.

19:57.359 --> 20:00.834
Courtney was just
cracking me up.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.439
I don't see almond oil
on it anywhere.

20:03.439 --> 20:05.176
<i>She always is doing
something to be dramatic</i>

20:05.176 --> 20:07.446
or the center of attention
or the victim,

20:07.446 --> 20:09.351
<i>and it's just so annoying
and like overwhelming</i>

20:09.351 --> 20:12.056
to even work
with someone like that.

20:12.056 --> 20:13.626
Okay, amazingly
this one doesn't.

20:13.626 --> 20:15.964
Well, usually products
do have almond oil.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.036
- That's like a known
fact. - ( mouths words )

20:19.036 --> 20:21.709
Stacey:
Oh, you're ready, Binta,
'cause you're next.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.746
Keep that energy up
throughout until when you're
finished.

20:23.746 --> 20:26.418
Binta:
<i>I know how to do videos.</i>

20:26.418 --> 20:28.188
I am... very playful
and very energetic person.

20:28.188 --> 20:32.196
Um...

20:32.196 --> 20:35.402
That's what they say,
I'm not,

20:35.402 --> 20:36.673
but that's actually
one of my biggest qualities.

20:36.673 --> 20:40.079
One and two and walk.

20:40.079 --> 20:40.212
<i>There is the moment
that we take this walk.</i>

20:44.220 --> 20:46.391
- Big energy.
- Director X:Do something
on camera.

20:46.391 --> 20:48.028
Do something.
Come on, work with it.
Work with it.

20:48.028 --> 20:50.199
Binta, she was just
totally a mess.

20:50.199 --> 20:53.372
<i>And how she's walking--</i>

20:53.372 --> 20:55.443
<i>she was being safe
with the poses.</i>

20:55.443 --> 20:58.048
<i>And it was so like,
well, bottom two.</i>

20:58.048 --> 20:59.852
Director X:
Zoom out. Zoom out.
Give something to the camera.

20:59.852 --> 21:01.387
And this is where
you dance.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.960
<i>Cut.</i>

21:03.960 --> 21:05.964
<i>Action!</i>

21:05.964 --> 21:07.768
<i>Hit that mark,
and live in that moment.</i>

21:07.768 --> 21:09.939
<i>Nope, that's not the mark.
That's an arrow to the mark.</i>

21:09.939 --> 21:11.441
As a model,
you're gonna live that life
of hitting marks.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.513
You're gonna have cameras.

21:13.513 --> 21:15.416
Mark, mark, mark, mark!

21:15.416 --> 21:17.220
<i>Courtney, she was walking
right through marks</i>

21:17.220 --> 21:18.055
or forgetting
where certain ones were
and never really

21:18.055 --> 21:20.459
lived in moments.

21:20.459 --> 21:21.730
Give something to the
camera.Give something to the
camera.

21:21.730 --> 21:23.933
<i>Camera's always there.</i>

21:23.933 --> 21:26.404
This is where
the dance happens.

21:26.404 --> 21:28.075
Drew:
You could see it
on her face

21:28.075 --> 21:29.477
<i>from the beginning
to the end.</i>

21:29.477 --> 21:30.780
It's like everything
was a complete panic.

21:30.780 --> 21:31.916
Cut it.

21:35.122 --> 21:39.799
I did a horrible job.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.435
And I got
fangirl intimidated

21:41.435 --> 21:43.439
<i>because I do know
who X is,</i>

21:43.439 --> 21:45.142
and I respect his work.

21:46.478 --> 21:47.246
<i>How was it?</i>

21:52.891 --> 21:57.434
Paige:
<i>Courtney comes back
after her take,</i>

21:57.434 --> 21:59.739
and it's obvious
that she's really upset

21:59.739 --> 22:01.108
and nobody seems to be
rushing over to console her,

22:01.108 --> 22:04.247
ask her what's going on.

22:04.247 --> 22:05.449
It's okay.

22:08.455 --> 22:09.992
Not everybody
has a perfect day
all the time.

22:09.992 --> 22:12.130
Cody: <i>Courtney
just cries a lot.</i>

22:12.130 --> 22:13.833
<i>It's pathetic, and I
don't think that a boss</i>

22:13.833 --> 22:15.837
would try to get
sympathy from people

22:15.837 --> 22:17.808
the way that she does.

22:17.808 --> 22:19.778
Don't beat
yourself up, okay?

22:19.778 --> 22:22.083
Courtney:
<i>I was bummed when I got
off set,</i>

22:22.083 --> 22:24.321
because I did horribly.

22:24.321 --> 22:28.195
I'm just so nervous.

22:28.195 --> 22:31.636
In this business, if you
were to act the way
you act with me

22:31.636 --> 22:34.140
with other people,
you'll be blacklisted
so quickly.

22:34.140 --> 22:37.012
I just loved that moment
at the end,

22:37.012 --> 22:39.183
but the rest of the video

22:39.183 --> 22:40.018
I never want to see again.

22:48.636 --> 22:53.345
- How're you doin'?
- Good. How are you?

22:53.345 --> 22:55.283
- This is India.
- India, good to meet you.

22:55.283 --> 22:56.786
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'm gonna walk you
through this.

22:56.786 --> 22:58.288
I was in the bottom three
last week,

22:58.288 --> 22:59.959
which is a huge
wakeup call.

22:59.959 --> 23:01.629
Take a moment
to have a pose,

23:01.629 --> 23:03.365
<i>and then we walk.</i>

23:03.365 --> 23:05.168
I'm like,
"I cannot be there again."

23:05.168 --> 23:06.639
<i>So I had a lot of motivation
coming into the shoot.</i>

23:06.639 --> 23:09.177
That's gonna be
your mark and land.

23:09.177 --> 23:10.647
<i>I really think this could
be my chance to kill it</i>

23:10.647 --> 23:13.185
and come out number one.

23:13.185 --> 23:14.387
Let's do it.

23:17.528 --> 23:22.369
India, she just turned it up
ten notches.

23:22.369 --> 23:25.008
Director X:
<i>Dance, dance, dance.</i>

23:26.679 --> 23:27.012
Good job, my dear.
Good Job.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.323
And land.

23:38.536 --> 23:43.178
<i>You're working
with Director X.</i>

23:43.178 --> 23:44.347
I'm just like, "Oh, my God,
way more pressure."

23:44.347 --> 23:47.186
Yes, and land.

23:47.186 --> 23:50.025
Cut. Cut. Cut.

23:50.025 --> 23:52.262
You're in New York City.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.200
It's a vibe,
it's not a still shoot.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.737
- Right.
- It's always in motion.

23:55.737 --> 23:57.674
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

23:57.674 --> 23:59.344
Kyle:
I'm a little nervous
because Director X

23:59.344 --> 24:00.847
<i>seems like
a very serious dude,</i>

24:00.847 --> 24:02.250
and if you don't deliver,
he's not gonna be happy.

24:02.250 --> 24:05.456
Director X:
<i>Hit it.</i>

24:05.456 --> 24:06.357
Hit that mark.
Hit that mark.

24:10.065 --> 24:10.132
There.
Let's go.

24:14.641 --> 24:15.375
I think Kyle really,
really had a hard time.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.922
Director X:
<i>And let's go, next.</i>

24:21.922 --> 24:23.927
Drew:
<i>She just looked nervous,</i>

24:23.927 --> 24:25.262
<i>and she looked likeshe was
trying to hit the poses</i>

24:25.262 --> 24:27.901
as opposed to
being in one music video.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.439
Director X:
<i>Dance.</i>

24:30.439 --> 24:33.646
<i>Hit it.</i>

24:33.646 --> 24:34.581
<i>That moment.
Don't go too far.</i>

24:38.422 --> 24:39.423
- <i>Don't go too far.</i>
- ( music slows, stops )

24:39.423 --> 24:41.228
<i>Too early.</i>

24:41.228 --> 24:43.131
Stacey:
Miss Marissa, because
she didn't listen,

24:43.131 --> 24:44.802
she goes on the set and
she did what she wanted to do.

24:44.802 --> 24:46.772
Director X:
<i>Mark and hit it.</i>

24:46.772 --> 24:48.576
<i>You're wrapping around
too early.</i>

24:48.576 --> 24:50.346
And is like flicking hat
and doing that same dumb pose.

24:50.346 --> 24:52.917
<i>I wonder why. She gave
me all this attitude,</i>

24:52.917 --> 24:54.253
<i>and then, of course,
she goes and she messes up.</i>

24:54.253 --> 24:57.026
Listen next time.

24:57.026 --> 24:58.863
Director X:
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

24:58.863 --> 25:01.535
Marissa:
On set, I definitely
was feeling really good.

25:01.535 --> 25:03.573
I couldn't tell you
what poses I was doing,

25:03.573 --> 25:06.445
<i>but I was definitely
having fun.</i>

25:06.445 --> 25:07.246
- <i>Cut. Cut.</i>
- I killed it.

25:07.246 --> 25:09.651
That is a wrap.

25:09.651 --> 25:10.787
- Good job. Good job.
- Thank you, Stacey.

25:10.787 --> 25:12.089
Girl, I need
to talk to you.

25:12.089 --> 25:13.358
<i>Yep.</i>

25:15.764 --> 25:17.701
Whenever you come across
somebody like me or whomever

25:17.701 --> 25:19.638
that's helping you
along your journey,

25:19.638 --> 25:21.709
like you cannot
be like lippy at all.

25:21.709 --> 25:23.946
- You can't do that.
- Absolutely.

25:23.946 --> 25:25.282
Keep your mouth shut,
listen to what they're saying.

25:25.282 --> 25:27.888
Let me tell you,
this business,

25:27.888 --> 25:29.456
if you were to act
the way you act with me
with other people,

25:29.456 --> 25:30.994
you'll be
blacklisted so quickly.

25:30.994 --> 25:33.733
<i>Miss Marissa,</i>

25:33.733 --> 25:35.202
if she doesn't
make it to the next round,

25:35.202 --> 25:36.371
if she doesn't
win this competition,

25:36.371 --> 25:38.776
not on me,
it's on you, baby.

25:38.776 --> 25:40.980
23 years in the business
and still counting.

25:40.980 --> 25:43.118
We're here to help you,
to mentor you and guide you.

25:43.118 --> 25:45.022
- Absolutely.
- 'Cause I want to see you
looking fabulous.

25:45.022 --> 25:45.623
I don't want to be rude,
but I already am fabulous.

25:51.167 --> 25:55.844
Honestly, the pressure
of the dancing part

25:55.844 --> 25:57.581
made me overthink
the whole thing.

25:57.581 --> 25:59.484
You got the dance--
everything, huh?

25:59.484 --> 26:01.087
Binta:
They just said I need
to bring a lot of energy,

26:01.087 --> 26:02.657
- <i>and that's what I did.</i>
- Good.

26:02.657 --> 26:04.595
I just get a vibe
from him, like,

26:04.595 --> 26:07.166
"Get off my set, Kyle."

26:07.166 --> 26:09.505
I am somewhat nervous.

26:09.505 --> 26:10.974
I was in last place
at the last panel,

26:10.974 --> 26:14.381
and I would really like
to move out of that position

26:14.381 --> 26:17.152
<i>because I totally believe
I can win this competition.</i>

26:17.152 --> 26:19.658
He just wants to see
how you're gonna take

26:19.658 --> 26:21.896
- the feedback.
- Yeah.

26:21.896 --> 26:24.167
Not everyone's
gonna like you.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.169
I'm not getting attached
to anyone, any friendship,

26:25.169 --> 26:27.607
any bond.

26:27.607 --> 26:29.077
<i>If it is Kyle
that goes home this week,</i>

26:29.077 --> 26:32.349
personally, I wouldn't be,
like, depressed over it

26:32.349 --> 26:34.788
because I just know
that I'm one step closer
to what I want to do.

26:34.788 --> 26:39.196
<i>RitAlert.</i>

26:39.196 --> 26:39.898
Hi, ladies.
Congratulations on making it
this far.

26:44.575 --> 26:46.612
<i>I know you've been
working really hard
to stay in the game,</i>

26:46.612 --> 26:48.916
but to find a winner,

26:48.916 --> 26:50.954
that means
sending someone home.

26:50.954 --> 26:53.693
Good luck.

26:53.693 --> 26:56.632
India:
Even though I think I did
super well,

26:56.632 --> 26:58.435
I am still nervous,
and I will always be
nervous for a panel,

26:58.435 --> 27:01.576
because I've been in
the bottom three.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.278
So putting me in the bottom two
and sending me home

27:03.278 --> 27:05.382
would make sense.

27:05.382 --> 27:06.953
I'm definitely nervous

27:06.953 --> 27:08.155
about getting my ass
chewed tomorrow.

27:08.155 --> 27:10.727
I know it's coming.

27:10.727 --> 27:12.062
At least you know
it's coming.

27:12.062 --> 27:13.398
I totally don't
want to go home at all.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.504
<i>That would just be crazy,</i>

27:15.504 --> 27:16.471
<i>but I'm just hoping
that the judges know</i>

27:16.471 --> 27:18.910
I'm not a bad person.

27:18.910 --> 27:20.947
- <i>I'm not a bad model.</i>
- Well, did my best.

27:20.947 --> 27:21.815
Good luck, be brilliant,
and may the force be with you.

27:40.921 --> 27:45.597
Rita:
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

27:45.597 --> 27:47.934
Let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.939
We have
a special guest today.

27:49.939 --> 27:51.509
The man who helped guide you
through your video shoot

27:51.509 --> 27:53.411
<i>and our first
guest judge</i>

27:53.411 --> 27:55.683

27:55.683 --> 27:59.324
and gorgeous
supermodel and body activist

creative consultant

28:03.431 --> 28:05.302
and chief creative officer
at "Paper" magazine...

28:05.302 --> 28:06.203

and get an exclusive
one-year talent deal with VH1.

28:25.844 --> 28:30.821
Now, this week
was all about movement,

28:30.821 --> 28:33.291
<i>using dance
to help you loosen up</i>

28:33.291 --> 28:36.163
and perfect your poses.

28:36.163 --> 28:37.667
<i>And now
we will take a look</i>

28:37.667 --> 28:39.236
<i>at the best three moments
of your video.</i>

28:39.236 --> 28:41.407
I can't wait to see
how you did.

28:41.407 --> 28:43.913
<i>First up, Paige.</i>

28:43.913 --> 28:46.852
I've heard
some great things,

28:46.852 --> 28:47.319
but let's talk
after we watch the video.

28:58.643 --> 29:02.751
- Oh, yeah.
- I just got shivers.

29:02.751 --> 29:05.990
I love the ending.

29:05.990 --> 29:07.761
Rita:
<i>This is a great example</i>

29:07.761 --> 29:09.063
of somebody really being
in their comfort zone

29:09.063 --> 29:12.937
<i>and not overdoing it.</i>

29:12.937 --> 29:14.039
You just came out there,
and you were hitting the marks.

29:14.039 --> 29:17.079
It was very professional.

29:17.079 --> 29:18.615
Good job.
I was very happy with that.

29:18.615 --> 29:19.951
And I feel like
you play to your brand
and your business,

29:19.951 --> 29:24.060
you did something
younger and fun,

29:24.060 --> 29:24.762
and I think you did
a good job with selling that.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.068
Thank you.

29:28.068 --> 29:29.705
Director X:
<i>You're actually my favorite
out of the lot.</i>

29:29.705 --> 29:31.207
Every mark you hit,
you made it yours.

29:31.207 --> 29:32.242
You knew what you were gonna do.
I enjoyed it a lot.

29:32.242 --> 29:34.213
Thank you so much.

29:34.213 --> 29:35.950
Coryanne.

29:41.628 --> 29:46.137
Ashley:
<i>I can't even dance
that good, girl.</i>

29:46.137 --> 29:48.609
- Wow! - Coryanne: <i>Oh, thank
you.</i>

29:48.609 --> 29:50.646
I loved that you were
comfortable,

29:50.646 --> 29:52.249
you acknowledged
your surroundings.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.552
Some people
forget to acknowledge,
like, the things

29:53.552 --> 29:54.988
that they have
around them.

29:54.988 --> 29:56.491
What I like
about this challenge

29:56.491 --> 29:57.894
is I was looking for
someone to interact in the
moment

29:57.894 --> 29:59.396
and, like,
you were cool--

29:59.396 --> 30:01.267
- You were solid.
- Thank you so much.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.371
Um, I hate
to be the...

30:03.371 --> 30:06.579
Oh, no,
here he goes.

30:06.579 --> 30:08.047
- <i>...the Debbie downer
in this situation.</i>
- Here he goes.

30:08.047 --> 30:09.952
I didn't really feel
dancer-model-music-video.

30:09.952 --> 30:12.991
For me,
I felt like
it was more like

30:12.991 --> 30:15.563
back-to-school commercial.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.999
- More fierce?
- <i>Yes.</i>

30:16.999 --> 30:18.168
- Less smiling?
- <i>Yes.</i>

30:18.168 --> 30:19.938
<i>Gotcha.</i>

30:19.938 --> 30:21.441
Rita:
<i>Marissa, first of all,</i>

30:21.441 --> 30:23.244
let's just get the elephant
out of the room.

30:23.244 --> 30:25.014
<i>Tell us what happened
between you and Stacey.</i>

30:25.014 --> 30:26.919
I felt very on the spot,
and I kept having to redo it,

30:26.919 --> 30:28.623
and she was not happy.

30:28.623 --> 30:30.593
So I just asked her,

30:30.593 --> 30:32.664
"Can you please tell me
what you would like to see?"

30:32.664 --> 30:34.500
- Did you say it like that? -
<i>That is exactly how I said
it.</i>

30:34.500 --> 30:36.838
- <i>Like that
with that tone of voice...</i>
- And she was like--

30:36.838 --> 30:38.509
- ...with that kind of calmness?
- <i>she said, "I am helping
you."</i>

30:38.509 --> 30:40.345
And I was like,
I'm sor-- I-- I said,
"Okay, I'll do it again."

30:40.345 --> 30:42.149
Marissa,
there's an attitude
that just walked up

30:42.149 --> 30:45.021
to this set right here,
and it screamed,

30:45.021 --> 30:46.959
"I'm better than all of this,
and I don't need to learn."

30:46.959 --> 30:49.831
I'm disappointed in you.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.869
I want you to succeed,

30:51.869 --> 30:53.939
but that attitude
is not going to succeed.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.211
You're as good
as your last job.

30:56.211 --> 30:59.450
Do not forget that.

30:59.450 --> 31:00.686
The bigger warning
for all y'all in this business--

31:02.791 --> 31:05.730
the higher-ups talk.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.232
<i>I've been in rooms
where people have been
denied jobs</i>

31:07.232 --> 31:09.336
<i>regardless of
a better performance</i>

31:09.336 --> 31:10.840
and a better audition
because, "Oh, no, no,
he's difficult."

31:10.840 --> 31:13.679
<i>That's the real
of the game.</i>

31:13.679 --> 31:14.347
Never be comfortable
in this competition.

31:14.347 --> 31:18.556
Ever.

31:18.556 --> 31:20.058
Okay.
Shall we take a look?

31:27.205 --> 31:32.917
Usually what happens
when you do movement,

31:32.917 --> 31:34.086
<i>you have a go-to move,
you know what I'm saying,
that you always repeat.</i>

31:34.086 --> 31:37.059
Your go-to move
is your hat.

31:37.059 --> 31:39.732
<i>It wasn't your best.</i>

31:39.732 --> 31:42.035
I just wish
that you were living in
the environment more.

31:42.035 --> 31:44.974
Where it all just seems very
walk and stop and pose.

31:44.974 --> 31:46.912
Drew:
Being the youngest
in the competition,

31:46.912 --> 31:49.316
it's showing now,
I think, more and more,

31:49.316 --> 31:50.753
because it's getting
really cutthroat.

31:50.753 --> 31:53.725
Up next, Cody.

31:59.604 --> 32:04.013
I kinda like it.
I'm not mad at it.

32:04.013 --> 32:06.752
I am a little
mad at it.

32:06.752 --> 32:08.221
- Oh, no.
- I mean, well,
my issue was--

32:08.221 --> 32:10.459
and a couple other girls
had this as well--

32:10.459 --> 32:11.962
<i>I'm doing a still shoot.</i>

32:11.962 --> 32:12.964
I'm just walking
to my still shoot.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.402
- Right.
- <i>Right,</i>

32:15.402 --> 32:16.905
<i>whereas the performance
that works with this...</i>

32:16.905 --> 32:18.074
This is moving cameras.
It's always gotta be in motion.

32:18.074 --> 32:20.946
Next up, Binta.

32:27.426 --> 32:32.303
Oh, God.
That was so bad, Binta.

32:32.303 --> 32:35.375
- Really?
- You looked
bat-( bleep ) crazy.

32:35.375 --> 32:37.647
Director X:
<i>It's not as simple
as a still shoot</i>

32:37.647 --> 32:39.416
where one moment
would be all we need.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.888
<i>24 frames</i>

32:41.888 --> 32:43.458
of perfection every second
is what we're looking for.

32:43.458 --> 32:46.766
That's not what
I want to produce, you know?

32:46.766 --> 32:48.803
I don't want
to produce that,
you know.

32:48.803 --> 32:52.075
Rita:
<i>Thanks, Binta.</i>

32:52.075 --> 32:52.910
Next up, Kyle.

33:02.496 --> 33:07.273
Ashley:
I could tell you were nervous,
but you owned it.

33:07.273 --> 33:10.580
It was a little
too fashion girl for me,

33:10.580 --> 33:12.683
- a little too, like...
- <i>For me,</i>

33:12.683 --> 33:14.353
<i>you are
the Gypsy Sport Girl.</i>

33:14.353 --> 33:15.489
Like, you have the look
that they use all the time.

33:15.489 --> 33:17.527
<i>I'm surprised.</i>

33:17.527 --> 33:18.529
Like, I thought
it was really cool.

33:18.529 --> 33:19.965
- Cool.
- Kyle...

33:19.965 --> 33:22.136
<i>( exhales deeply )</i>

33:22.136 --> 33:23.706
I hate it.

33:23.706 --> 33:26.444
I just loved
that moment at the end,

33:26.444 --> 33:29.751
but the rest of the video
I never want to see it again.

33:29.751 --> 33:33.760
<i>Every single challenge, am
I gonna just wait for that</i>

33:33.760 --> 33:36.798
little bit of hope?

33:36.798 --> 33:38.334
Or is she gonna come
and just be like, "Boom!

33:38.334 --> 33:40.371
I am a boss,
a brand, a business,
a superstar.

33:40.371 --> 33:43.344
<i>I'm Kyle."</i>

33:43.344 --> 33:44.648
I didn't see that at all.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.183
- So thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

33:48.723 --> 33:51.662
Rita:
Courtney.
What's that face?

33:51.662 --> 33:54.400
- Are you nervous?
- I'm not gonna lie.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.837
I'm a little nervous
'cause, you know,

33:55.837 --> 33:58.308
I'm not really a dancer.

33:58.308 --> 33:59.944
- <i>So...</i>
- Hey, let us be the judge.

34:05.322 --> 34:09.797
You and Cody
have the exact same problem.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.369
You are"Italian Vogue" girls,

34:12.369 --> 34:13.873
<i>but you needto know how to
bea "Teen Vogue" girl, too.</i>

34:13.873 --> 34:17.045
That wasn't
an "Italian Vogue" video.

34:17.045 --> 34:18.481
That was "Teen Vogue,"
and you shoulda played to that

34:18.481 --> 34:20.987
and made it more fun
and smiled a little bit more.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.425
And just hada different type

34:23.425 --> 34:24.326
of persona
walking into it.

34:24.326 --> 34:26.998
Let me tell you,

34:26.998 --> 34:28.268
when we were on set,
you were like, "I blew it."

34:28.268 --> 34:30.673
<i>And I said,
"Yes, you did."</i>

34:30.673 --> 34:33.077
And for some reason

34:33.077 --> 34:33.645
every camera
that we've used here
loves you.

34:34.747 --> 34:39.223
Rita:
<i>Do you know what?</i>

34:39.223 --> 34:41.060
Thank goodness
for your face.

34:41.060 --> 34:42.596
That's where
this side of the game
is different.

34:42.596 --> 34:43.599
<i>I don't hire
still-shot look.</i>

34:43.599 --> 34:45.369
I go, look, performance,

34:45.369 --> 34:47.406
and performance
edges out look.

34:47.406 --> 34:48.576
<i>I'd rather take a girl
with a lesser look</i>

34:48.576 --> 34:50.613
that's gonna
give me energy

34:50.613 --> 34:52.248
<i>than the girl
who looks great</i>

34:52.248 --> 34:54.419
but the performance
isn't right.

34:54.419 --> 34:55.589
So always go with
performance. Do you know what I
mean?

34:55.589 --> 34:57.058
Thanks, Courtney.

34:57.058 --> 34:58.361
Tatiana.

35:04.941 --> 35:09.951
I mean,
you did have that
little bounce

35:09.951 --> 35:11.588
in your movement
which I had to give you,
but that's it.

35:11.588 --> 35:14.727
I think you're
a real professional.

35:14.727 --> 35:16.230
I think the attitude,
everything about it.

35:16.230 --> 35:17.800
I think if you would've gotten
four or five more takes,

35:17.800 --> 35:20.740
it would've been
crème de la crème.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.743
You're one of my faves.
I'm proud of you.

35:22.743 --> 35:25.048
- So keep going.
- Thank you.

35:25.048 --> 35:27.052
Rita:
<i>Thank you, Tatiana.</i>

35:27.052 --> 35:29.089
And last but not least,
India.

35:29.089 --> 35:32.563
- How're you doin'?
- I'm good.

35:32.563 --> 35:33.665
- I'm really excited
to see this video.
- Well, let's have a look.

35:40.478 --> 35:45.055
<i>You made me smile.</i>

35:45.055 --> 35:47.058
It didn't stop moving,
it wasn't stop and start.

35:47.058 --> 35:49.230
<i>Just moving. The braids
helped you a lot.</i>

35:49.230 --> 35:51.167
And you wore the clothes
really well.

35:51.167 --> 35:53.170
I'm just happy,
'cause you were just doing you.

35:53.170 --> 35:55.107
- Yep.
- Director X: That's motion.
You hit the mark.

35:55.107 --> 35:56.912
You were always moving.
You're always doing something.

35:56.912 --> 35:59.317
You're always happy,
and you made things interesting.

35:59.317 --> 36:01.187
- <i>It was good.</i>
- My favorite video
of the whole night.

36:01.187 --> 36:03.592
- Thank you, guys.
- Rita: <i>Thanks, India.</i>

36:03.592 --> 36:05.128
Good job.

36:05.128 --> 36:06.932
Models,
now we'll be having

36:06.932 --> 36:08.602
a chat to decide
who will be getting best video

36:08.602 --> 36:10.004
and who will be
going home tonight.

36:22.663 --> 36:27.707
Okay, guys.
Let's talk about who did
the best this week.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.546
<i>- For me, India.
- I thought India.</i>

36:30.546 --> 36:32.216
- Yeah, India did
really good.- Not Paige?

36:32.216 --> 36:34.320
<i>If the spot
was back-to-school,</i>

36:34.320 --> 36:35.823
<i>we're selling
backpacks and pencils,</i>

36:35.823 --> 36:38.127
she's Ms. Congeniality.

36:38.127 --> 36:40.032
But the thing is
she's owning that.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.002
Till I walked in here
and saw India's piece,

36:42.002 --> 36:43.806
I thought Paige was hands
down, this is the one who did
it.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.545
India, I didn't
remember it being great,

36:46.545 --> 36:48.682
but seeing it
I'm like, "Oh, okay."

36:48.682 --> 36:50.485
India in this competition,
I would never have said,

36:50.485 --> 36:52.389
- "Oh, that's a
Gypsy Sport girl."
- <i>Exactly.</i>

36:52.389 --> 36:54.026
And look what
she's been able
to transform into

36:54.026 --> 36:56.732
- which has been
really exciting.
- Yeah.

36:56.732 --> 36:59.871
Now let's talk about
who didn't do so well this week.

36:59.871 --> 37:02.577
Courtney.
She was stiff.
There was no motion.

37:02.577 --> 37:04.881
There's the maybe pile.
The no pile.

37:04.881 --> 37:06.718
She's in the no pile for me.

37:06.718 --> 37:07.687
The thing that has saved
Courtney every single week

37:07.687 --> 37:09.524
is her pretty face.

37:09.524 --> 37:11.260
We need more.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.097
What about poor Kyle.

37:13.097 --> 37:15.335
Director X:
<i>Kyle was stiff as a board</i>

37:15.335 --> 37:18.308
<i>until the final moment</i>

37:18.308 --> 37:19.711
<i>where she showed a bit
of herself.</i>

37:19.711 --> 37:20.713
The problem is
every single week we say,

37:20.713 --> 37:24.052
What else can you bring?

37:24.052 --> 37:25.022
We got a little glimmer.
What else is there?

37:25.022 --> 37:26.558
<i>We got a little glimmer.</i>

37:26.558 --> 37:27.894
It's not satisfying
just to see glimmers anymore.

37:27.894 --> 37:29.229
- No.
- Rita: <i>Marissa.</i>

37:29.229 --> 37:31.568
She got me heated tonight.

37:31.568 --> 37:33.037
She came in to panel
ready to fight.

37:33.037 --> 37:35.609
But to her defense,
she's young.

37:35.609 --> 37:38.348
I look at Marissa
and I feel like

37:38.348 --> 37:39.584
<i>every day's a day
of how beautiful you are.</i>

37:39.584 --> 37:41.186
She don't get criticized.

37:41.186 --> 37:42.590
People don't tell Marissa
she's doing it wrong.

37:42.590 --> 37:43.892
Where I'm from
is the old saying,

37:43.892 --> 37:45.095
she think her ( bleep )
don't stink.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.432
I just want to say
to everyone...

37:47.432 --> 37:51.741
<i>Stop it.</i>

37:51.741 --> 37:52.041
- No, wait.
- No, babe, come on.

37:57.720 --> 38:02.095
I know like I bumped heads
with quite a few of you,

38:02.095 --> 38:04.300
but, whatever,
and so thanks.

38:04.300 --> 38:07.439
Marissa, they know
that you can do better.

38:07.439 --> 38:09.142
They know.

38:14.286 --> 38:18.762
Models,
welcome back.

38:18.762 --> 38:20.566
The judges
have deliberated,

38:20.566 --> 38:22.604
<i>and if I call your name</i>

38:22.604 --> 38:24.073
<i>you will be staying
another week</i>

38:24.073 --> 38:24.908
<i>to prove you have
what it takes</i>

38:24.908 --> 38:26.945
to be "next top model."

38:26.945 --> 38:29.551
<i>The first name
I'm gonna call</i>

38:29.551 --> 38:30.953
gets best video
this week.

38:30.953 --> 38:35.328
India.

38:35.328 --> 38:36.999
For weeks I have been
waiting for you to pop.

38:36.999 --> 38:40.238
This was your week.
Congratulations.

38:40.238 --> 38:42.677
Next name
I'm gonna call is...

38:42.677 --> 38:45.782
<i>Paige.</i>

38:45.782 --> 38:47.820
<i>Good work.</i>

38:47.820 --> 38:49.591
Next name
I'm gonna call is...

38:49.591 --> 38:52.496
- Coryanne.
- Thank you.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.667
Tatiana.
Good work.

38:54.667 --> 38:57.272
Cody.

38:57.272 --> 39:00.746
Binta.

39:00.746 --> 39:02.784
Only two of you
still have a chance to become

39:02.784 --> 39:05.355
the "next top model."

39:05.355 --> 39:06.156
Courtney.

39:09.964 --> 39:10.799
Will Marissa and Kyle
please step forward?

39:20.686 --> 39:25.362
Kyle, we keep waiting to see
that confidence,

39:25.362 --> 39:28.569
for you to fully own it
and just really live up

39:28.569 --> 39:32.375
to that potential
that we all see.

39:32.375 --> 39:33.210
Marissa,
you're here because your
performance was mediocre

39:35.882 --> 39:39.189
but your attitude
was terrible.

39:39.189 --> 39:40.993
You are a gorgeous girl,

39:40.993 --> 39:43.665
but that attitude
needs an adjustment

39:43.665 --> 39:45.669
<i>if you want to be on top.</i>

39:46.738 --> 39:46.838
So which one of you
is gonna stay?

39:53.552 --> 39:58.227
<i>Marissa.</i>

39:58.227 --> 40:00.064
<i>Go join
the rest of the girls.</i>

40:03.070 --> 40:07.814
<i>Kyle,
I am so sorry.</i>

40:07.814 --> 40:10.251
- You've done a great job.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

40:10.251 --> 40:12.222
Thank you for being a part
of "Next Top Model."

40:12.222 --> 40:15.663
Yeah, gave it
my best shot, guys.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.065
<i>Thanks for believing in me
for as long as you did.</i>

40:17.065 --> 40:19.737
- Love you, Kyle.
- Love you guys, too.

40:19.737 --> 40:21.608
<i>I was definitely
out of my element</i>

40:21.608 --> 40:23.779
in most of the
competition,

40:23.779 --> 40:27.285
<i>but I gave it my all.</i>

40:27.285 --> 40:28.756
<i>I learned a lot,
and I surprised myself
week after week.</i>

40:28.756 --> 40:30.926
<i>This industry
is really tough,</i>

40:30.926 --> 40:33.130
<i>but there are people</i>

40:33.130 --> 40:34.734
that will help you
along the way,

40:34.734 --> 40:35.970
and they want to see
you do well.

40:35.970 --> 40:39.611
<i>Marissa and I definitely</i>

40:39.611 --> 40:41.446
forged a very close
and strong bond,

40:41.446 --> 40:42.883
<i>and I think
she's gonna kill it
in the competition.</i>

40:58.281 --> 41:03.224
Welcome to my mansion.

41:03.224 --> 41:05.127
The party of the town
and we're invited.

41:05.127 --> 41:09.436
<i>He's looking
for Jason Derulo.</i>

41:09.436 --> 41:10.939
Oh, ( bleep ).
Jason Derulo's here?

41:10.939 --> 41:13.477
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

41:13.477 --> 41:15.048
You're gonna be
photographed living the Lux life

41:15.048 --> 41:18.054
in this private jet.

41:18.054 --> 41:21.627
<i>I just want you to
understand for future
reference</i>

41:21.627 --> 41:23.064
that if I don't like the
way that you're treating
someone,

41:23.064 --> 41:25.301
I will say something.

41:25.301 --> 41:26.069
This house
is wearing on me.

41:31.748 --> 41:35.321
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
