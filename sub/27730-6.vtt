00:08.356 --> 00:10.401
Previously
onStar Trek: Discovery...

00:10.445 --> 00:12.838
Section 31?She's tracking
a suspected murderer.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.144
Mr. Spock is one of mine.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.493
I think there may be
a connection between Spock

00:15.537 --> 00:17.539
and the signals
around the universe.

00:17.582 --> 00:20.498
AMANDA:
Spock drew those images.What is it?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.239
AMANDA:
He called it the Red Angel.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.154
That vision changed him
forever.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.590
I've seen this angel, too.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.070
STAMETS:
I watched Tyler kill you.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.680
I held your body.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.160
BURNHAM:
He is alive.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.641
STAMETS:
We're getting you out of here.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.168
DETMER:
Something has grabbed us
out of warp, sir.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.561
We're locked into place.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.867
Some kind of a life-form?It must need something.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.347
It's trying to send
us a message.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.610
Because it wants
to be remembered, preserve

00:45.654 --> 00:47.482
its history using Discovery.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.442
Its final act was to save us.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.053
We have recorded
everything

00:53.096 --> 00:54.880
it has seen and experienced.

00:54.924 --> 00:57.057
SARU:
The Sphere is triggering
the Kelpien biological

00:57.100 --> 00:59.102
process known asVahar'ai.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.756
Signals when Kelpiens are

01:00.799 --> 01:02.714
ready for slaughter
by the Ba'ul,

01:02.758 --> 01:04.063
the predator species

01:04.107 --> 01:05.543
on my homeworld of Kaminar.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.242
You are the only one
who knows me.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.331
You replaced the sister I had
on Kaminar.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.159
POLLARD:
Your vital signs
have returned to normal.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.813
I have never felt
this way before.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.120
Fear is gone.

01:17.164 --> 01:22.256
What my people have accepted
as the truth is a lie?

01:31.917 --> 01:35.530
SARU:
We all come from somewhere.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.409
We carry that place with us
wherever we go.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.861
That never leaves our hearts.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.907
Not entirely.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.439
How's it going in here?

02:15.483 --> 02:16.962
TILLY:
Oh, my-- well,

02:17.006 --> 02:18.747
without Airiam, we
would have spent months

02:18.790 --> 02:20.314
trying to sort through
the Sphere's data.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.793
SARU:
But none of us can predict...

02:21.837 --> 02:23.186
Okay, look at this.
This is incredible.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.622
...where our voyage will lead.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.320
The data collection of
the Sphere isn't random.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.973
Oh, no,
it's not random at all.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.281
It's actually an impossibly
sophisticated repository

02:31.325 --> 02:35.807
of... like, a slice
of the galaxy's history.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.245
It's like this delicious slice
of galaxy pie.

02:38.288 --> 02:42.118
SARU:
We may suffer losses
along the way,

02:42.162 --> 02:46.166
but we can hope to learn and
grow from those experiences.

02:48.864 --> 02:53.216
And from those who accompany us on our journey.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.147
It is almost inconceivable

03:11.191 --> 03:15.238
to have you back
with us, Dr. Culber.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.589
Inconceivable, yeah.

03:18.633 --> 03:23.203
There isn't a test or a, a scan
Dr. Pollard hasn't run on me.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.595
Well, you appear yourself.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.641
Well, I don't feel
like myself.

03:30.514 --> 03:34.518
Enduring something no
one thought possible

03:34.562 --> 03:39.741
can be transformative.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.352
Perhaps,

03:42.396 --> 03:47.009
perhaps, in feeling
less like you were,

03:47.052 --> 03:52.623
you are more like who
you were meant to become.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.756
Commander Saru?

03:54.799 --> 03:57.759
Your results.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.936
The most evident anatomical
change from the Kelpien advent

04:00.979 --> 04:02.329
of your Vahar...

04:02.372 --> 04:03.721
Vahar'ai. Thank you.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.419
With the loss of
your threat ganglia,

04:05.462 --> 04:08.509
the cartilage that housed it
is reorganizing to accommodate

04:08.552 --> 04:10.685
a new type of
keratin-based tissue.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.861
It looks like spikes
growing in like teeth.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.906
Does that sound right?

04:16.125 --> 04:18.257
I would not know.

04:19.954 --> 04:24.568
Did you discover anything that
might affect me psychologically?

04:24.612 --> 04:27.484
These are your neurotransmitter
expression patterns,

04:27.528 --> 04:29.007
last year versus today.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.096
With you as
my only Kelpien specimen--

04:31.140 --> 04:33.577
forgive the term--
it's difficult to say

04:33.621 --> 04:35.057
with certainty
what these changes mean.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.667
But if I had to guess,

04:36.711 --> 04:39.148
I'd say your fear responses
are being repressed.

04:46.982 --> 04:50.768
SARU: What is a Kelpien without fear?

04:50.812 --> 04:54.250
I am losing the very thing
that defines me.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.776
I am stumbling in the dark.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.952
And yet I cannot help but feel

05:00.996 --> 05:03.955
that somewhere
within the unknown,

05:03.999 --> 05:07.611
there is purpose.

05:07.655 --> 05:11.702
And that we are being
guided toward it.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.704
TYLER:
It's Section 31's position

05:13.748 --> 05:16.054
that if the entity
we're calling the Red Angel

05:16.098 --> 05:17.621
is in fact generating
these signals,

05:17.665 --> 05:20.798
it's also capable
of time incursions.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.627
And should be
considered dangerous.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.542
So far, these signals
have led the Discovery

05:25.586 --> 05:27.152
on two rescue missions.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.980
Or two catastrophic events.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.852
Does the Angel merely appear
at these crisis points,

05:30.895 --> 05:32.984
or is it creating them?

05:33.028 --> 05:34.856
We have to consider
both options.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.466
So let's consider.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.251
The Red Angel appeared on Earth
and transported people

05:39.295 --> 05:41.689
to Terralysium
only moments before

05:41.732 --> 05:44.039
they would have died
in a nuclear blast.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.693
It also guided Spock
to rescue me when I was

05:45.736 --> 05:47.477
a child on Vulcan.TYLER:
I've seen the drawings

05:47.521 --> 05:50.350
from Spock's time
in the psychiatric unit.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.917
Look, can either of you
say for sure

05:52.961 --> 05:55.006
this thing didn't cause
his nervous breakdown?

05:55.050 --> 05:56.704
Spock made no mention
of the Red Angel

05:56.747 --> 05:58.662
when he asked for leave
from the Enterprise.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.012
But Agent Tyler's
correct, Captain.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.666
With so few data points,
it is impossible

06:02.710 --> 06:06.496
to draw conclusions based
on its nature and motivations.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.932
We need more
information.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.456
What we need is Spock.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.545
TYLER:
Captain Leland
has devoted significant

06:11.588 --> 06:13.721
Section 31 resources
to finding him.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.767
But we're coming up
empty-handed.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.595
As his sister,
can you think of anywhere

06:18.639 --> 06:20.118
Spock might have gone?

06:20.162 --> 06:21.946
Someplace we might not
have thought to look?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.557
SARU :
Captain,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.385
you are needed on the bridge.What is it?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.387
We have detected a new signal.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.524
Where is it this time?

06:34.568 --> 06:37.266
Outside of Federation space.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.445
Ah.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.622
OWOSEKUN:
Acquiring coordinates.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.407
On screen.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.234
We have a lock, sir.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.541
The signal is over
an M-class planet.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.109
It's listed in the
Federation database as...Kaminar.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.417
Commander Saru, that's...Yes.

06:57.460 --> 07:01.072
Kaminar is my homeworld.

08:56.579 --> 09:00.496
Kaminar is populated
by two sentient species:

09:00.540 --> 09:03.673
my people-- the Kelpiens--
and the Ba'ul.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.719
The Ba'ul are your predators.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.592
The Ba'ul achieved warp
capability 20 years ago.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.421
The USS Archimedesmade
first contact with them

09:12.464 --> 09:14.423
after receiving
a transmission from Kaminar.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.338
But once communication
was established,

09:16.381 --> 09:17.774
the Ba'ul High Council
proved hostile.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.297
TYLER:
So why did the Ba'ul send

09:19.341 --> 09:21.082
a transmission
in the first place?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.300
They...

09:22.344 --> 09:24.302
did not.

09:24.346 --> 09:28.002
That transmission was from me.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.526
I coopted
the Ba'ul's technology

09:30.570 --> 09:33.747
in order to send a message,
with the hope

09:33.790 --> 09:36.619
that someone, somewhere,
would receive it.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.882
And that someone
was Captain Georgiou.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.189
SARU:
She was a lieutenant then,

09:41.232 --> 09:44.018
serving on theArchimedes.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.846
Were it not for her,
I would have been unable

09:45.889 --> 09:49.153
to flee Kaminar
or be granted asylum.

09:50.198 --> 09:53.549
I promised never to return.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.552
That was the price of knowledge.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.510
PIKE:
And now,
of the billions of planets

09:58.554 --> 10:00.512
in our galaxy, the
signal just happens

10:00.556 --> 10:04.299
to show up above the homeworld
of my first officer.

10:04.342 --> 10:07.476
What are the odds?It certainly isn't random.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.479
Discovery'staken a serious
interest in the Red Angel.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.872
Could be
it's returning the favor.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.787
TYLER:
That's a leap.
Commander Saru,

10:13.830 --> 10:16.180
are there angels
of any sort in Kelpien culture?

10:16.224 --> 10:19.488
Kelpiens believe only
in the Great Balance,

10:19.531 --> 10:21.403
which, if upset, would devastate

10:21.446 --> 10:24.188
the fragile ecosystem
of our planet.

10:24.232 --> 10:29.541
And we are taught that the Ba'ul
are the keepers of this balance.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.327
Do the Kelpiens worship
the Ba'ul?

10:32.370 --> 10:35.330
It is their superior technology,
of which Kelpiens live in awe,

10:35.373 --> 10:38.115
that allows the Ba'ul mastery
over my people.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.204
They hide behind it.

10:40.248 --> 10:43.164
No Kelpien has even seen
a Ba'ul in living memory.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.992
BURNHAM:
It is the same technology

10:45.035 --> 10:47.168
they use to keep
Starfleet at arm's length.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.387
So we shouldn't expect
a warm welcome.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.215
The Ba'ul are, by nature,
isolationist.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.043
And they're committed
to preserving

10:53.087 --> 10:55.524
the status quo on Kaminar.TYLER:
Well, they must have seen

10:55.567 --> 10:58.483
the signal, too.Maybe they wouldn't mind an
offer to share information.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.094
Depending on
how they're approached.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.574
Well, let's knock on the front
door and see if they answer.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.403
And then what? Just ask nicely?

11:05.447 --> 11:09.190
Well, as unexpected guests,
it never hurts to be polite.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.242
MAN:
Prepare to disengage
warp power.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.767
DETMER:
Sir, stopping out of
warp above Kaminar.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.905
The signal disappeared

11:28.949 --> 11:30.515
before we arrived.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.952
What else is new?

11:31.995 --> 11:34.432
Mr. Bryce, hail the Ba'ul
on all channels.

11:34.476 --> 11:37.435
Commander Burnham, run planetary
and full-spectrum scans

11:37.479 --> 11:39.263
on anything resembling
our elusive angel.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.439
And any power source capable
of generating these signals.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.137
The Ba'ul are not
responding, sir.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.269
That's not entirely true, sir.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.707
They're scanning
our weapons systems.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.926
Just our weapons systems.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.842
So much for knocking
on the front door.PIKE: Maybe the Ba'ul just

11:52.886 --> 11:54.670
haven't learned the importance
of a good first impression.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.107
Burnham?I see no indication
the Red Angel was here.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.284
Or any immediate danger
to the planet.Then why are we here? Anybody?

12:00.328 --> 12:02.286
You're assuming the signals
only appear for a reason.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.288
Yes, Mr. Tyler, that's
exactly what I'm assuming.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.813
Why won't the Ba'ul respond?SARU:
Perhaps,

12:06.856 --> 12:09.946
as I have said, it is
because they are oppressors.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.383
And even had the Ba'ul
answered our hails,

12:12.427 --> 12:14.777
why would you trust those
who have enslaved my people

12:14.821 --> 12:16.561
for centuries
with fear and lies?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.174
PIKE:
Your insights
are invaluable,

12:20.217 --> 12:21.784
Mr. Saru.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.568
But the signal appeared here.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.483
And maybe the Red Angel, too.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.529
If you have any idea how I could
make inquiries without...

12:27.572 --> 12:29.531
There is a Kelpien priest
in every village.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.751
Priests not only serve
as intermediaries

12:31.794 --> 12:34.536
between us and the Ba'ul,
but they also connect

12:34.579 --> 12:37.365
all of our extended
communities together.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.932
So if the Red Angel
appeared on Kaminar,

12:38.975 --> 12:41.238
then a priest might be able
to tell us about it.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.327
Wouldn't that be a violation
of General Order 1?BURNHAM: Though the Kelpiens

12:43.371 --> 12:45.286
aren't warp capable, they've
seen warp-capable technology

12:45.329 --> 12:46.504
through the Ba'ul,

12:46.548 --> 12:48.811
and they know about spaceflight.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.118
First contact with the Kelpiens
by Starfleet

12:51.161 --> 12:52.772
is a judgment call,

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
but our mission
to investigate these signals

12:54.817 --> 12:56.123
would seem to require it.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.515
We can stretch
General Order 1,

12:57.559 --> 12:58.908
but let's try not to break it
in the process.

12:58.952 --> 12:59.909
Burnham,

12:59.953 --> 13:01.171
as a xenoanthropologist,

13:01.215 --> 13:02.477
I think you're
uniquely qualified

13:02.520 --> 13:04.131
to talk
to a village priest.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.610
SARU:
Sir,

13:05.654 --> 13:07.656
I am the logical choice.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.266
I offer my experience.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
To disregard it
is to disregard the suffering

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
of generations of Kelpiens.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.706
PIKE:
Given all that suffering,

13:14.750 --> 13:16.708
you're the most
complicated choice.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.494
Do you doubt my ability
to carry out the mission?

13:19.537 --> 13:20.756
PIKE:
Of course not.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.062
But at present, we lack
a full understanding

13:22.105 --> 13:23.846
of the biological...

13:23.890 --> 13:26.544
and behavioral changes
you're undergoing.

13:26.588 --> 13:30.374
I can assure you, Captain,
I am still very much myself.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.159
I can only imagine the pressure
you might feel to share

13:32.202 --> 13:34.378
the truth with your people
about Vahar'ai.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.771
Are you suggesting
that I might be incapable

13:35.815 --> 13:37.207
of following Starfleet
regulations?

13:37.251 --> 13:39.557
Or that I would
disobey your orders?

13:44.084 --> 13:45.433
Captain.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.611
Kelpiens have no knowledge
of Starfleet

13:49.654 --> 13:52.222
or any other
inhabited worlds.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.920
Even though General Order 1
allows contact,

13:53.963 --> 13:57.053
my arrival could come as
a complete shock to them.

13:57.097 --> 14:01.362
Commander Saru would be
invaluable to have by my side.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.799
All right.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.063
But I'll remind you both, we're
here to gather information

14:07.107 --> 14:08.891
about the signals
and the Red Angel,

14:08.935 --> 14:12.503
not start a war between
the Kelpiens and the Ba'ul.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.378
Mr. Saru?

14:17.421 --> 14:21.861
My duty, first and foremost,
is to Discovery'smission, sir.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.558
I never doubt that.

14:25.516 --> 14:26.909
Start in your
own village.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.432
Maybe they'll be
glad to see you.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.788
CULBER:
So, uh,

14:36.832 --> 14:39.922
what did the scan say?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.664
Read 'em yourself.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.278
All normal.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.627
You're you.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.412
POLLARD:
Yes and no.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.849
Brain patterns and neural
impulses are identical,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.024
but this body

14:55.068 --> 14:57.635
was entirely reconstituted
from your DNA.

14:57.679 --> 15:01.813
It's brand-new down to the
last molecule. You are,

15:01.857 --> 15:04.904
for lack of a better word,
pristine.

15:09.604 --> 15:13.042
My scar, it's gone.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.304
STAMETS:
It is?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.654
I hadn't noticed that.What scar?

15:16.698 --> 15:18.830
Oh, the scar
he chose to keep.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.223
You never told her
the story?

15:20.267 --> 15:24.836
He was hiking the cliffs
of Cabo Rojo, alone.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.273
I was 16...

15:26.316 --> 15:28.623
STAMETS:
And apparently indestructible.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.059
The path he
was on gave way,

15:30.103 --> 15:31.887
and he fell 30 meters.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.976
15, actually.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.586
Well, enough to puncture
your shoulder.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.240
He would've bled out, too,

15:37.284 --> 15:39.155
if it weren't for a
certain Dr. Kashkooli,

15:39.199 --> 15:40.983
who was half a
kilometer behind him.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.768
She risked her own life
to climb down and help him.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.770
She stitched his wound up
with a fishing line.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.468
Gave him a very

15:47.511 --> 15:49.470
sexy scar

15:49.513 --> 15:51.515
and inspired him to go
to medical school

15:51.559 --> 15:54.649
and become the man he is today.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.827
It is weird not
seeing it on you.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.569
So, um...

16:03.397 --> 16:05.529
...i-if my senses feel
a little off, it's...

16:05.573 --> 16:07.792
It's because your new nervous
system is still adjusting.

16:07.836 --> 16:11.144
I'd like to continue
monitoring you, but I believe

16:11.187 --> 16:14.060
you're ready to resume
your normal life soon.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.866
That pylon.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.521
It isn't Kelpien,
is it?

16:41.522 --> 16:43.219
No.

16:43.263 --> 16:47.832
The Ba'ul have erected one
in each village to observe us.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.661
It has earned them a fitting
name among my people:

16:50.705 --> 16:53.534
the Watchful Eye.

16:53.577 --> 16:57.059
This pylon is connected
to an incredibly vast network.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.931
Must have taken
the Ba'ul generations

16:59.975 --> 17:02.151
to integrate their
technology and ideology

17:02.195 --> 17:04.066
into Kelpien society.

17:04.109 --> 17:07.069
Our two species have become
so intertwined that,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.070
outside their
technology,

17:09.115 --> 17:11.638
it is difficult to
discern what is purely us

17:11.682 --> 17:14.207
and what is distinctly them.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.861
Where is everyone?

17:16.905 --> 17:19.603
The day's work is done.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.910
It will soon be nightfall.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.955
Kelpiens rarely venture
out in the dark.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.397
I led this life once.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.400
If I didn't know
your people were oppressed,

17:33.443 --> 17:35.793
I'd think Kaminar
was a paradise.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.621
Well, in many ways, it is.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.276
We live in harmony
with each other,

17:40.320 --> 17:42.496
in a world without
hunger or poverty.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.629
The only violence we
know is the culling,

17:45.673 --> 17:48.371
which Kelpiens have
been misled to accept

17:48.415 --> 17:51.461
as a mercy
by the Ba'ul.

17:51.505 --> 17:56.423
And our priests
sustain that belief.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.121
Didn't you say
your father was a priest?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.645
Yes, he was
a collaborator,

18:01.689 --> 18:05.127
albeit an
unwitting one,

18:05.171 --> 18:08.348
enforcing the grip
the Ba'ul had on my people.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.443
Saru...

18:17.444 --> 18:21.709
For 18 years,

18:21.752 --> 18:24.625
I dreamt of returning
to my village.

18:24.668 --> 18:28.281
It has not changed at all.

18:28.324 --> 18:31.414
But I see it...

18:31.458 --> 18:33.460
quite differently now.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.960
These are the same flowers
from your quarters.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.919
Fredalia, yes.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.443
They do not grow quite
so well on a starship.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.649
Brother?

19:32.693 --> 19:34.173
Siranna!

19:35.957 --> 19:38.089
Saru!

19:38.133 --> 19:40.614
You're alive.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.182
Oh, but how?

19:43.225 --> 19:44.661
We thought
you were dead.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.315
Taken by the Watchful Eye
for questions

19:46.359 --> 19:47.534
you should not
have asked.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.753
Oh...

19:49.797 --> 19:52.887
Where have you been
all this time?

19:52.930 --> 19:57.848
Siranna, 18 years ago,

19:57.892 --> 20:00.373
I thought I could find
my future in the stars,

20:00.416 --> 20:04.246
and I did. Uh...

20:08.076 --> 20:12.036
I was welcomed

20:12.080 --> 20:14.561
by an interstellar service
called Starfleet,

20:14.604 --> 20:19.000
committed to peace and the
exploration of our galaxy.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.481
An organization far more
powerful than the Ba'ul.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.311
I found a new life.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.537
What are you?

20:34.581 --> 20:38.454
I'm human. My name is Michael.

20:38.498 --> 20:41.718
I come from a planet
called Earth,

20:41.762 --> 20:44.982
and I work with your brother
on the starship Discovery.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.857
How is it that we can
understand one another?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.163
This device.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.340
It's able to translate
over a thousand languages.

20:54.383 --> 20:57.952
You mean to say there are
a thousand life-forms out there?

20:57.995 --> 21:01.651
Oh, not just a thousand--
hundreds of thousands.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.984
So different and yet...

21:36.077 --> 21:38.862
The galaxy?

21:38.906 --> 21:40.473
Space travel?

21:45.956 --> 21:48.872
Do humans from Earth drink tea?

22:01.929 --> 22:05.454
Oh, how I have missed
the fredalia tea of home.

22:05.498 --> 22:09.153
We were blessed with
a bountiful harvest this year.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.417
Oh, you sound
just like Father.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.290
Where is he?

22:15.334 --> 22:19.642
Father reached his Vahar'ai
and joined the Great Balance

22:19.686 --> 22:24.212
not long after you... left us.

22:25.735 --> 22:29.348
How could you?

22:29.391 --> 22:32.394
And never even let us know
that you were still alive?

22:32.438 --> 22:35.005
I thought it would be safer
for you to believe I was dead.

22:35.049 --> 22:38.052
Safer?

22:38.095 --> 22:40.837
We believed you had outraged
the Watchful Eye.

22:40.881 --> 22:44.014
We spent years in agony,
fearing retribution.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.582
I dreamed of our
reunion, brother.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.280
I could not be
more sorry, Siranna.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.500
This is a longer conversation.

22:51.544 --> 22:56.070
But I sense that is not
the reason you are here.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.726
I...

23:08.604 --> 23:11.520
We're looking for an entity

23:11.564 --> 23:14.697
that we call
the Red Angel.

23:16.873 --> 23:21.356
We have reason to believe that
it appeared here on Kaminar.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.359
Is it another life-form?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.231
We do not yet know what it is,
only that it appears

23:27.275 --> 23:29.843
in conjunction with a red burst
of light in the sky

23:29.886 --> 23:33.020
and in places
of crisis.

23:33.063 --> 23:36.502
The fiery sign... I saw it.

23:38.068 --> 23:41.594
Have you seen or heard anything
that might be this Red Angel?

23:41.637 --> 23:43.378
Maybe from
the priests

23:43.422 --> 23:45.815
in the other
villages?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.777
This is why you have returned?

23:53.867 --> 23:56.043
I should have known
you did not come back for me.

23:56.086 --> 23:59.002
Siranna,
I ask you to...

23:59.046 --> 24:01.004
You ran away because you were

24:01.048 --> 24:04.094
not brave enough to face the
Balance as the rest of us do.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.238
What's happening?

24:17.281 --> 24:18.587
The Ba'ul.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.589
They must have observed
your return.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.809
Once again you disturb
the Great Balance

24:22.852 --> 24:24.724
and put our village in danger.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.117
You must leave now!

24:27.161 --> 24:28.467
We won't be safe
until you're gone.

24:31.034 --> 24:34.429
Siranna, this might be the last
time we ever see each other.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.301
Return to the stars, Saru.
There is no place for you here.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.012
SARU:
They're coming.

24:53.056 --> 24:56.016
Discovery,beam us back.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.083
COMPUTER:
Yellow alert.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.868
Commander Saru,
Commander Burnham,

25:21.911 --> 25:23.826
please report to the bridge.

25:29.658 --> 25:33.619
Whatever you did,
the Ba'ul are hailing us now.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.491
I'm going to guess it's not
to invite us to a welcome party.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.624
BRYCE:
Communication channel
established.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.147
It's audio-only.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.192
Mr. Saru, I think
it would be best

25:42.236 --> 25:43.846
if you stay out
of this conversation.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.762
This is Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS Discovery...

25:46.806 --> 25:50.592
BA'UL:
You have taken
what belongs to us.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.029
What have we taken, exactly?

25:53.073 --> 25:55.336
A Kelpien.

25:55.379 --> 25:58.339
Starfleet promised

25:58.382 --> 26:02.778
that it would not meddle in the
internal affairs of our planet.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.912
We're investigating the signal
that appeared over your planet,

26:05.955 --> 26:07.783
which I'm sure
you noticed.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.829
These signals are typically
followed by the arrival

26:09.872 --> 26:12.179
of an entity we call
the Red Angel.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.702
Are you familiar
with it?

26:17.488 --> 26:21.101
The Red Angel may pose a threat
to Kaminar's Great Balance.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.016
Our mutual interest
lies only

26:23.059 --> 26:24.452
in keeping the peace,
which we all...

26:24.495 --> 26:28.761
No one is safer
than under the Watchful Eye.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.371
Return the Kelpien to us,

26:30.414 --> 26:33.679
and we will allow you
to leave without harm.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.245
I am not yours to be returned!

26:35.289 --> 26:36.116
Mr. Saru.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.639
I am brother

26:37.683 --> 26:40.424
to Siranna, who lives
a life of oppression.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.948
I am son of Aradar,

26:41.991 --> 26:44.777
who died needlessly
at your hands.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.779
The Kelpien speaks.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.563
I am Commander Saru,

26:48.607 --> 26:50.565
the first and only Kelpien
to join Starfleet,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.741
and I know the truth
about Vahar'ai.

26:52.785 --> 26:55.048
The Great Balance is
the only truth,

26:55.091 --> 26:57.093
and it must not be disturbed.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.096
Your lies no longer work on me.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.968
I survived
my Vahar'ai

27:02.011 --> 27:03.752
and I know that
it means not death

27:03.796 --> 27:07.669
but evolution, an evolution you
murder my people to suppress.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.888
Commander...

27:08.931 --> 27:12.587
You think you know everything,
Kelpien,

27:12.631 --> 27:16.243
but you do not even know
what you are.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.679
DETMER:
Captain, I detect

27:17.723 --> 27:19.899
ten Ba'ul sentry ships
on an intercept course.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.814
Shields up. Red alert.
Show me what we're dealing with.

27:35.479 --> 27:36.829
Ba'ul ships are powering up
their weapons.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.700
Warm up the phasers.
RHYS:
Aye, Captain.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.049
PIKE:
Whoever is listening
to my voice,

27:40.093 --> 27:41.529
I advise that you consider

27:41.572 --> 27:42.878
your next move very carefully.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.924
Give us the Kelpien.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.926
PIKE:
Commander Saru is a
political asylum seeker

27:46.969 --> 27:48.188
and a Starfleet officer,

27:48.231 --> 27:50.538
protected by the Federation.

27:50.581 --> 27:52.714
You would risk the lives
of your own people

27:52.758 --> 27:54.455
for one Kelpien?

27:54.498 --> 27:55.456
This Kelpien

27:55.499 --> 27:57.458
isour people.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.200
And to defend him, I will do
whatever I deem necessary.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.115
As will we.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.638
The Ba'ul are activating
the pylon

28:03.682 --> 28:04.639
in Commander
Saru's village.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.641
You have interfered

28:06.685 --> 28:09.078
in the affairs of this village.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.080
If you do not return
the Kelpien,

28:11.124 --> 28:12.516
there'll be blood on your hands.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.605
The pylons are weaponized.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.520
They mean to destroy my village.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.348
We have to...Mr. Saru!

28:18.392 --> 28:20.046
You will remove yourself
from the bridge.

28:20.089 --> 28:22.222
But, Captain...That's an order.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.857
COMPUTER:
Red alert.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.468
All crew
to their assigned stations.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.834
You are relieved from duty.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.096
Sir?
Get out.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.457
Saru, I know what you're doing.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.589
Move off the transporter pad
now.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.905
Or what, Michael?

29:36.949 --> 29:39.473
I don't want to use this.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.170
But you're not
thinking clearly, Saru.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.086
I have never felt more clarity
than in this moment.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.958
This is the only way.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.832
Would you not do the same
for your own brother?

30:07.370 --> 30:10.852
Sir, someone is beaming down
to planet surface.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.941
What? Who is it?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.943
BURNHAM:
Burnham to the bridge.
It's Commander Saru.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.466
He's surrendering himself.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.990
Damn it.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.079
Captain, the sentry ships are
powering down their weapons.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.615
Ops, track Saru's signal.

30:37.009 --> 30:39.359
A Ba'ul ship has taken him.

30:39.402 --> 30:42.014
They're traveling toward...
I've lost the signal, sir.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.755
He's gone.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.467
Well, with 100,000 years' worth
of data,

31:00.510 --> 31:02.512
there has to be some information
about Kaminar

31:02.556 --> 31:04.819
in the Sphere's archive.Well, what precisely
are we looking for?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.299
When the Ba'ul
learned that Saru

31:06.342 --> 31:07.648
had survived his Vahar'ai,

31:07.691 --> 31:09.302
their determination
to capture him increased.

31:09.345 --> 31:12.696
It was as if his continued
existence threatened them.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.263
You think the Ba'ul
are hiding something?

31:14.307 --> 31:16.048
I think they know
more about the changes

31:16.091 --> 31:18.050
brought on by Vahar'ai
than the Kelpiens do.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.268
And I think
they're willing to do

31:19.312 --> 31:20.269
almost anything
to keep that secret.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.228
Will they kill Saru?

31:22.271 --> 31:24.447
Not if we can find out
what they're hiding in time.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.928
And there has to be something
in the Sphere's archive.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.234
There has to be.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.976
Well, that's what
Airiam and I are here for.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.194
We will find it.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.369
There it is.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.328
When I said "we,"
I just meant Airiam.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.069
The Sphere did collect
readings from Kaminar.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.506
Thousands of years' worth
of statistical measurements.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.160
Transfer it over
to this station, please.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.560
And when Saru challenged
the Ba'ul, they said,

31:50.604 --> 31:53.302
"You do not even know
what you are."

31:53.346 --> 31:56.392
So, what is Saru?

32:28.642 --> 32:30.731
Siranna?!

32:30.774 --> 32:32.689
Brother?

32:32.733 --> 32:34.343
Oh, why did
the Watchful Eye take me?

32:34.387 --> 32:36.693
It is not yet my time.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.695
My sister has nothing
to do with this!

32:38.739 --> 32:40.741
I am the one you wanted.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.442
Why did you have to return?

32:46.486 --> 32:48.923
Everyone else
thought you were dead.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.229
But the night you disappeared,

32:50.272 --> 32:52.231
I saw the light
rising into the sky.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.586
I became a priest
to seek that light.

32:59.629 --> 33:00.891
To seek you.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.981
Your face is beautiful to me,

33:03.024 --> 33:05.592
but part of me hoped
I would never see it again.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.336
Because it might mean
you were free.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.455
No! No.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.113
Stop!

34:37.161 --> 34:39.206
Fascinating.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.208
Airiam, can you identify

34:41.253 --> 34:43.385
historical biological records
from Kaminar's surface?

34:43.429 --> 34:44.690
Searching...

34:46.649 --> 34:50.130
Yes, bio-signs were archived
by the Sphere.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.786
Um, actually, I can use those
current readings of the Ba'ul

34:52.829 --> 34:54.701
to distinguish their bio-signs
from the Kelpiens'.

34:54.744 --> 34:55.831
Right, and we can
cross-reference

34:55.876 --> 34:57.530
Saru's medical records

34:57.573 --> 35:00.098
to isolate
the post-Vahar'aiKelpiens'

35:00.141 --> 35:02.230
historic bio-signs
from the rest of their species.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.840
The Ba'ul could
only know about

35:03.884 --> 35:05.973
the evolutionary
consequences of Vahar'ai

35:06.016 --> 35:08.149
if, at one time, they
experienced them.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.108
Otherwise, why does it
threaten them?

35:10.151 --> 35:14.590
Well, if we, uh,
go back 2,300 years, uh,

35:14.634 --> 35:16.723
there's a significant portion
of the Kelpiens were like Saru.

35:16.766 --> 35:19.117
They survived Vahar'ai?

35:19.160 --> 35:20.770
The blue represents
evolved Kelpiens,

35:20.814 --> 35:23.643
green unevolved, red Ba'ul.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.906
Sorry, that...

35:25.949 --> 35:27.647
that doesn't look right.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.823
The Ba'ul narrowly escaped
extinction.

35:29.866 --> 35:33.174
Then they turned around

35:33.218 --> 35:34.958
and wiped out the
evolved Kelpiens.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.960
Leaving only unevolved Kelpiens,
but...

35:37.004 --> 35:38.962
Wait, so all this
would mean that...

35:39.006 --> 35:40.964
The Ba'ul were originally
the prey species.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.141
So they would think
of Saru as a...

35:43.184 --> 35:45.186
Predator.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.168
BA'UL:
The first Kelpien

36:10.211 --> 36:12.082
to pass its Vahar'ai

36:12.126 --> 36:14.128
in over 2,000 years,

36:14.172 --> 36:17.175
and your primal, feral responses

36:17.218 --> 36:20.221
are the same as centuries ago.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.877
Your kind can never govern
itself.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.227
The Federation has no idea

36:26.271 --> 36:30.405
what they have welcomed
into their ranks.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.103
They gave me the chance
stolen by the Ba'ul.

36:33.147 --> 36:37.499
Your species does not deserve
a second chance.

36:37.543 --> 36:41.024
The Great Balance
is the only way to ensure

36:41.068 --> 36:44.593
you do not destroy
everything in your path.

36:44.637 --> 36:48.075
The Great Balance is a lie

36:48.118 --> 36:51.557
you created
to defend yourselves from us,

36:51.600 --> 36:53.820
and to absolve yourselves
of murder.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.431
In truth, you are frail.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.259
You would be helpless
without your technology.

36:58.303 --> 37:03.003
We will never allow
the past to be repeated.

37:03.046 --> 37:07.529
No threat to the Great Balance
will go unanswered.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.183
You cannot maintain
what you think of as peace

37:09.227 --> 37:10.793
by continuing to cull us.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.492
Kelpiens are more
than our instincts.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.190
You are the only two Kelpiens
to know the truth.

37:16.234 --> 37:20.673
You will undergo analysis
and be neutralized.

37:20.716 --> 37:23.850
The truth will be contained.

37:24.894 --> 37:25.895
Wait!

37:39.648 --> 37:41.084
No, please, stop!

37:48.918 --> 37:49.876
Siranna!

38:23.039 --> 38:25.128
It is true, then.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.566
You have survived Vahar'ai?

38:27.609 --> 38:28.784
Yes.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.265
I am what we
used to become.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.485
The form we were meant to take.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.138
The Great Balance...

38:35.182 --> 38:37.140
our sacrifice
to the Watchful Eye...

38:37.184 --> 38:38.359
It was all a lie.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.318
Forced upon us by the Ba'ul.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.972
That stole our mother and father
from us.

38:43.016 --> 38:46.149
And generations of Kelpiens,
beyond reckoning.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.891
And it must end.

39:08.998 --> 39:12.001
The Ba'ul used their
technological advantage

39:12.045 --> 39:14.830
to lock the Kelpiens
into subservience,

39:14.874 --> 39:16.266
allowing them to live

39:16.310 --> 39:17.616
while eliminating the threat
they posed.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.531
And that's why
the Ba'ul are afraid.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.359
Well, if we can
help them understand

39:21.402 --> 39:22.838
that Saru is not a threat,

39:22.882 --> 39:24.623
that his people
need not be a threat...

39:24.666 --> 39:26.407
BRYCE:
Sir, we're receiving a hail...

39:26.451 --> 39:28.409
from the Ba'ul.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.240
We should accept it.

39:40.290 --> 39:43.511
Discovery,
this is Commander Saru.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.383
It's good to hear your voice,
Commander.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.560
I am with Siranna,
inside a Ba'ul structure.

39:48.603 --> 39:49.648
But we have no
other indicators

39:49.691 --> 39:51.824
of our position.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.956
We can't seem to get a lock
on your coordinates either.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.089
Your location must be shielded
from our sensors.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.525
Have you come in contact
with the Ba'ul?

39:57.569 --> 39:59.440
Yes. It was...

39:59.484 --> 40:01.486
enlightening.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.878
BURNHAM:
Commander Saru,

40:02.922 --> 40:04.619
we used the
Sphere's archives

40:04.663 --> 40:06.186
to analyze your
planet's history,

40:06.229 --> 40:08.144
and it's far more complex
than we thought.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.408
All evidence indicates that

40:10.451 --> 40:13.367
Kelpiens, in post-Vahar'aiform,

40:13.411 --> 40:15.935
were once the Ba'ul's predators.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.111
That confirms
my suspicions.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.939
And the Ba'ul's
belief that,

40:19.982 --> 40:21.375
after passing Vahar'ai,

40:21.419 --> 40:23.029
my people can
only be predators.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.814
They will do anything
to continue the culling.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.469
And to keep more Kelpiens
from learning the truth.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.819
It will not be easy
to convince my people

40:30.863 --> 40:33.213
the Great Balance
is a deception,

40:33.256 --> 40:35.389
but we must find
a way to save them.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.869
Thousands of years
of conditioning

40:36.912 --> 40:38.436
will take time to undo.

40:38.479 --> 40:39.959
SARU:
But Siranna is right.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.048
We must demonstrate to Kelpiens

40:42.091 --> 40:43.484
and Ba'ul alike
what we could become.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.877
The same way I was shown.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.227
TILLY:
The Sphere.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.794
The Sphere triggered
your Vahar'ai.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.143
Yes, but we need to
accelerate the process.

40:50.186 --> 40:52.145
We cannot allow the Ba'ul

40:52.188 --> 40:55.496
to take action before Vahar'ai
is complete for all Kelpiens.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.760
If we isolate
the active frequencies

40:58.804 --> 41:01.850
in the Sphere's transmission,
the corresponding sound wave

41:01.894 --> 41:03.504
should speed up
the biological response, right?I got it.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.375
SARU:
And the Ba'ul
will have no choice

41:05.419 --> 41:07.552
but to face our evolved race.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.684
What if history repeats itself?

41:09.728 --> 41:12.731
We can't be responsible for the
extinction of the Ba'ul species.

41:12.774 --> 41:15.473
But the Ba'ul are still vastly
technologically superior.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.387
It would take the
Kelpiens generations

41:17.431 --> 41:19.433
to become a serious threat.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.435
Generations during which
the Ba'ul could face

41:21.479 --> 41:23.437
the thing they fear
most about us.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.440
Not our so-called
baser instincts.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.050
Our rage.

41:28.094 --> 41:32.881
But we will prove to them
that we can move beyond it.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.448
We will not perpetuate
the cycle.

41:34.492 --> 41:35.710
We will create

41:35.754 --> 41:37.146
a new balance.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.759
Captain, I cannot prove it,

41:40.802 --> 41:44.502
but I believe this is what the
signal brought us here to do.

41:44.545 --> 41:45.894
Very well, Commander.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.767
Discoverywill help you
amplify the signal.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.812
BURNHAM:
How will we broadcast
the Sphere's transmission

41:50.856 --> 41:52.248
to all the Kelpiens at once?

41:52.292 --> 41:53.728
The same way I made
first contact

41:53.772 --> 41:55.121
with Captain Georgiou.

41:55.164 --> 41:58.777
By using the Ba'ul's own
technology against them.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.605
That should do the trick.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.476
Commander Saru,
I'm sending you the modified

42:02.520 --> 42:04.826
Sphere transmissions now.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.581
Once I do this,

42:20.625 --> 42:23.845
all Kelpiens, including
you, will begin Vahar'ai.

42:23.889 --> 42:26.152
Everything will change.

42:26.195 --> 42:31.244
I'm afraid it'll be
much more painful,

42:31.287 --> 42:33.768
like being torn
apart from within.

42:33.812 --> 42:35.291
Just promise me, brother,

42:35.335 --> 42:37.598
that this will not be
the end of our people.

42:37.642 --> 42:41.602
No. It will be a new beginning.

42:46.259 --> 42:48.348
Then let it begin.

43:14.983 --> 43:16.942
Bio-sign readings
indicate that Vahar'ai

43:16.985 --> 43:19.466
has initiated in 63%
of Kelpiens and rising.

43:28.344 --> 43:31.130
I'm sorry.
It will be over soon.

43:39.094 --> 43:41.314
Sir, I'm detecting
massive activity

43:41.357 --> 43:42.663
beneath the surface of the lake.

43:42.707 --> 43:44.099
On screen.

43:44.143 --> 43:46.624
There's a structure
rising above the water.

43:46.667 --> 43:48.321
At least 50 kilometers
in diameter.

44:24.226 --> 44:26.751
A Ba'ul stronghold.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.187
Protected by a powerful
force field.

44:28.230 --> 44:29.231
That might be where
they're holding

44:29.275 --> 44:30.624
Commander Saru and Siranna
captive.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.844
Red alert. Rhys, target
that structure's shields.

44:32.887 --> 44:34.846
If we destroy them,
maybe we can get a lock on Saru

44:34.889 --> 44:36.151
and his sister's location.

44:44.464 --> 44:46.509
You have survived.

44:57.172 --> 44:58.957
We have angered the Ba'ul.

45:06.529 --> 45:09.619
Owosekun, tell me
what I'm looking at.

45:09.663 --> 45:11.099
That Ba'ul structure is
activating pylons

45:11.143 --> 45:12.448
across the planet,

45:12.492 --> 45:14.320
with an energy buildup
capable of destroying

45:14.363 --> 45:15.843
every Kelpien village.

45:15.887 --> 45:17.715
Rather than let
them evolve,

45:17.758 --> 45:19.020
the Ba'ul are
committing genocide?

45:19.064 --> 45:21.631
Bryce, hail these bastards.

45:21.675 --> 45:23.416
Rhys, forget the stronghold.
Get a target lock

45:23.459 --> 45:24.765
on those pylons.

45:24.809 --> 45:26.636
They're not responding, sir.Open a channel.

45:28.334 --> 45:30.902
This is Captain Pike.
I will not allow you

45:30.945 --> 45:33.426
to wipe out an entire race.

45:33.469 --> 45:35.602
Your fear of the Kelpiens
has blinded you

45:35.645 --> 45:37.778
to a peaceful solution.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.040
Starfleet can help you
negotiate a new balance

45:39.084 --> 45:40.607
between your two species,

45:40.650 --> 45:42.652
protecting everyone
on your world.

45:42.696 --> 45:44.829
However, if you choose

45:44.872 --> 45:47.092
to murder the entire
Kelpien population...

45:48.571 --> 45:51.792
...you will become our enemies.

45:51.836 --> 45:53.838
Choose wisely.

45:56.623 --> 46:00.932
Sir, they've activated
all 4,056 pylons

46:00.975 --> 46:03.151
in every Kelpien village.Lieutenant Rhys?

46:03.195 --> 46:04.892
There are too many pylons
to target at once, sir.

46:04.936 --> 46:06.633
Let's get started.

46:06.676 --> 46:07.765
Arm photon torpedoes.

46:10.506 --> 46:11.725
On my order.

46:16.643 --> 46:18.819
The Ba'ul mean to kill us all!

46:18.863 --> 46:20.342
Discoverywill stop them.

46:23.171 --> 46:24.172
No, no!

46:58.424 --> 47:00.339
Sir, sensor readings
indicate

47:00.382 --> 47:01.731
a massive spike in
electromagnetic radiation

47:01.775 --> 47:03.516
in the Ba'ul structure.

47:03.559 --> 47:05.997
The pulse has deactivated
all the pylons across Kaminar.

47:06.040 --> 47:06.998
Rhys, hold your fire.

47:07.041 --> 47:08.477
What the hell
is happening?

47:08.521 --> 47:10.175
The Ba'ul weapons and shields
have all been disabled,

47:10.218 --> 47:11.872
but I can't get a reading
on what caused it.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.874
DETMER:
The technology required
to generate

47:13.918 --> 47:15.136
electric and magnetic fields
that wide...

47:15.180 --> 47:17.617
This should be impossible.

47:42.990 --> 47:45.645
That is what you came to find.

47:48.126 --> 47:50.476
A savior.

48:26.077 --> 48:28.731
Siranna, what has happened?

48:28.775 --> 48:31.952
How have we
survived Vahar'ai?

48:31.996 --> 48:35.434
The truth has survived.

48:35.477 --> 48:38.480
It is time for a true balance
to be restored.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.929
You do not have to
be afraid anymore.

49:06.421 --> 49:08.119
MAN :
Attention, all personnel...

49:22.046 --> 49:23.569
What's this?

49:23.612 --> 49:25.832
Commander Saru's report,

49:25.875 --> 49:27.529
shared in the spirit
of cooperation.

49:27.573 --> 49:30.315
Thanks to Commander Saru's
enhanced eyesight,

49:30.358 --> 49:33.840
he was able to get a better look
at the Red Angel.

49:33.883 --> 49:37.017
"The entity appears
to be a humanoid

49:37.061 --> 49:40.020
"wearing a
mechanized suit,

49:40.064 --> 49:41.935
"exhibiting technology
far beyond

49:41.979 --> 49:44.024
present Federation
capabilities."

49:44.068 --> 49:48.028
So, it's someone.

49:48.072 --> 49:50.857
And whether human
or alien,

49:50.900 --> 49:52.946
it has extremely
advanced technology.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.036
Someone who is manipulating
the fates of entire species.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.604
Control,

49:58.647 --> 50:00.040
which models Section 31's
threat assessments,

50:00.084 --> 50:02.521
is probably rightfully
alarmed by...

50:02.564 --> 50:04.218
what is it? A...

50:04.262 --> 50:08.048
a time-traveling being
pursuing its own agenda?

50:11.573 --> 50:14.098
When we forced the Ba'ul
to decentralize their power

50:14.141 --> 50:16.448
across the entire planet,

50:16.491 --> 50:19.407
the Red Angel took advantage
of their temporary exposure

50:19.451 --> 50:22.236
and used its advanced technology

50:22.280 --> 50:24.064
to save the Kelpiens
from genocide.

50:24.108 --> 50:25.544
And what happens
when that technology

50:25.587 --> 50:27.024
is turned against us?

50:28.112 --> 50:31.941
Section 31...

50:31.985 --> 50:35.075
and Control's
threat-assessment models...

50:35.119 --> 50:36.598
seem a bit paranoid.

50:38.948 --> 50:40.907
You're aware we're
no longer at war?

50:40.950 --> 50:43.910
And we don't want to
end up in one again.

50:43.953 --> 50:46.652
This last war, sir, took a toll

50:46.695 --> 50:49.089
on those who fought it.

50:49.133 --> 50:52.092
Some of us are still torn apart.

51:13.157 --> 51:14.984
SARU:
I felt the same way

51:15.028 --> 51:17.030
the first time I saw it,

51:17.074 --> 51:21.426
looking down on our
planet, our home.

51:21.469 --> 51:23.602
Well, you took home
with you.

51:23.645 --> 51:26.039
Well, seeds of it, yes.

51:26.083 --> 51:31.566
This little garden was
all I had for so many years.

51:31.610 --> 51:33.699
But I realized

51:33.742 --> 51:37.398
there was so much
more out there.

51:40.619 --> 51:43.752
You could come with me, Siranna,

51:43.796 --> 51:45.145
if you wanted to see it.

51:45.189 --> 51:48.061
Just for a while.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.282
No.

51:51.325 --> 51:54.198
I must stay for my people.

51:54.241 --> 51:56.548
There is a long road ahead,

51:56.591 --> 51:58.854
Our minds must truly be free

51:58.898 --> 52:01.335
before Kelpien and Ba'ul
accept each other.

52:03.859 --> 52:06.079
But I am happy, brother.

52:06.123 --> 52:10.214
I know you did not
leave Kaminar in fear,

52:10.257 --> 52:13.173
but in hope.

52:13.217 --> 52:15.480
And you brought that hope
back with you.

52:15.523 --> 52:17.873
You and your Red Angel.

52:45.118 --> 52:47.076
You are welcome
to return home

52:47.120 --> 52:48.687
whenever you would like,
brother.

52:49.688 --> 52:52.865
I will, sister.

53:24.331 --> 53:27.160
Thank you, Michael.

53:29.162 --> 53:31.991
I'm reminded.
Do you know Aeschylus?

53:32.034 --> 53:33.645
An ancient Greek tragedian,

53:33.688 --> 53:36.169
born circa 525 BC.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.954
"He who learns must suffer.

53:38.998 --> 53:41.914
And even in our sleep..."

53:41.957 --> 53:44.917
"Pain that cannot forget

53:44.960 --> 53:48.573
falls drop by drop
upon the heart."

53:55.319 --> 54:01.194
Knowing that my sister
has a chance to evolve,

54:01.238 --> 54:04.110
to live a full life,

54:04.153 --> 54:07.244
it makes me feel I
can endure anything.

54:09.246 --> 54:12.292
I am sure, given
the opportunity,

54:12.336 --> 54:15.469
you would do the same
for your own brother.

54:18.385 --> 54:20.169
If I could find him.

54:26.393 --> 54:27.742
But seeing you with Siranna

54:27.786 --> 54:29.962
has made one thing
very clear to me.

54:30.005 --> 54:32.878
And that is?

54:32.921 --> 54:35.620
I need to go home as well.

54:35.663 --> 54:37.274
To Vulcan.
