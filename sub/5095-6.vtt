Hey.

Move your car!

00:41.682 --> 00:43.432
You move.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.935
Are you kidding me?
I've got deliveries to make.

00:45.937 --> 00:48.854
Bro, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

00:48.856 --> 00:51.740
You're pissing me off.

00:52.910 --> 00:54.860
You want to swallow

(grunting)

01:23.608 --> 01:25.107
Police! Stop!
Hey.

01:25.109 --> 01:26.408
Got a minute?

01:26.410 --> 01:28.077
Yeah.

01:28.079 --> 01:29.378
I need a favor.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.397
You mean you need
to give me an order?

01:31.399 --> 01:34.116
How'd you know how
to find me out here?

01:34.118 --> 01:35.951
I'm the police commissioner;
I know everything.

01:35.953 --> 01:37.686
What's the favor?

01:37.688 --> 01:40.623
Well, Battle of the Shields
is coming up fast,

01:40.625 --> 01:42.224
and Ramirez, our welterweight...

01:42.226 --> 01:44.043
Yeah?
...hurt his ankle.

01:44.045 --> 01:45.794
He needs to be replaced.

01:45.796 --> 01:47.429
I was thinking of you.

01:47.431 --> 01:49.164
When is it?

01:49.166 --> 01:50.699
Six days.

01:50.701 --> 01:51.917
(chuckles):
Six days?

01:51.919 --> 01:53.769
I haven't been in a
ring in five years.

01:53.771 --> 01:55.588
Oh, hell, you're already
doing the roadwork.

01:55.590 --> 01:57.590
No, that's different
than boxing shape.

01:57.592 --> 02:00.009
Come on, we can't let
those smoke-eaters

02:00.011 --> 02:01.226
have bragging rights.

02:01.228 --> 02:03.512
And, frankly...

02:03.514 --> 02:06.315
I need you to commit
before your brother gets wind.

02:06.317 --> 02:08.901
Why? He won in
that class twice.

02:08.902 --> 02:11.604
Yeah, back in '05 and '06.

02:11.606 --> 02:15.741
Anyway, Halloween's coming up,
his boys love Halloween--

02:15.743 --> 02:18.777
he misses enough
of them as it is.

02:18.779 --> 02:20.863
We never had this conversation.

02:20.865 --> 02:22.448
Thank you.

02:23.951 --> 02:26.201
BAEZ: Two dudes
fought over a parking spot.

02:26.203 --> 02:28.954
One of them beat the other down
with a tire iron.

02:28.956 --> 02:30.339
He live?

02:30.341 --> 02:32.091
Bus is taking him
to St. Benjamin's

02:32.093 --> 02:33.626
with multiple
facial fractures.

02:33.628 --> 02:34.910
He's not likely,

02:34.912 --> 02:36.462
but he is gonna need surgery.

02:36.464 --> 02:38.347
Sounds like a street fight. What
the hell they need us here for?

02:38.349 --> 02:39.615
Well, when the unis ran

02:39.617 --> 02:41.884
the suspect's name,
they got more hits than Beyoncé.

02:41.886 --> 02:43.819
He's on the FBI's
terrorist watch list,

02:43.821 --> 02:46.605
and Interpol has
a Red Notice out on him.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.857
This guy is wanted
by everybody.

02:48.859 --> 02:50.976
DANNY:
Son of a bitch.

02:50.978 --> 02:53.462
Zoran Brasha.
Right.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.197
How did you know that?

02:55.199 --> 02:56.482
It was before your time
in the squad;

02:56.484 --> 02:58.701
this guy had a real
reign of terror going.

02:58.703 --> 03:00.653
Drug dealing,
executing witnesses--

03:00.655 --> 03:02.154
he even put out
a $400,000 hit

03:02.156 --> 03:04.073
on the U.S. Attorney
prosecuting him.

03:04.075 --> 03:05.791
Why is he still
on the streets?

03:05.793 --> 03:07.076
He's Teflon.

03:07.078 --> 03:08.744
He's, like,
the Albanian John Gotti--

03:08.746 --> 03:10.879
nothing sticks.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.665
He say anything?

03:12.667 --> 03:15.167
He seemed to only know
one word in English.

03:15.169 --> 03:16.719
“Lawyer”?
Yeah.

03:16.721 --> 03:18.637
Of course.
Look, Reagan,

03:18.639 --> 03:20.255
he was covered
in the vic's blood,

03:20.257 --> 03:22.508
and he still had the tire iron
in his hand

03:22.510 --> 03:23.809
when they rolled up on him.

03:23.811 --> 03:25.177
He's not getting
out of this one.

03:25.179 --> 03:27.980
Well, from your lips
to God's ears.

Let me guess--
Sergeant Gormley's replacement.

04:10.639 --> 04:13.473
This is Lieutenant Carver.

04:13.475 --> 04:15.024
Something funny here, ladies?

04:15.026 --> 04:19.144
Detective Baez will be writing
up your reports from now on.

04:19.147 --> 04:21.481
Your crimes against grammar
are the first ones

04:21.483 --> 04:23.399
I'm gonna fight
in this unit.

04:23.401 --> 04:25.285
That's fine by me.

04:25.287 --> 04:28.121
Let's talk
in my office.

04:31.877 --> 04:34.577
You've led the squad in
civilian complaints every year.

04:34.579 --> 04:36.830
And you've got
a hook, Detective.

04:36.832 --> 04:39.332
That makes you very
hard to control.

04:39.334 --> 04:41.718
I also led all of
Manhattan South in collars.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.720
And for the record,
I have never used

04:43.722 --> 04:45.388
my old man's name
for any favors.

04:45.390 --> 04:46.923
That's what I heard.

04:46.925 --> 04:49.142
Well, you heard right.

04:49.144 --> 04:50.560
So let's understand
each other.

04:50.562 --> 04:52.312
I don't look the other way

04:52.314 --> 04:54.397
where stepping on the
line is concerned.

04:54.399 --> 04:56.349
And I'm always watching.

04:56.351 --> 04:57.734
Okay.

04:57.736 --> 04:58.935
When you're
productive,

04:58.937 --> 05:01.070
you look good
and I look good.

05:01.072 --> 05:02.772
But when you're
out of line,

05:02.774 --> 05:05.525
it's my ass on the
hot seat at One PP,

05:05.527 --> 05:07.026
and that's not good.

05:08.413 --> 05:10.580
Okay.

05:10.582 --> 05:13.016
If you're feeling nostalgic
for your former C.O., don't.

05:13.018 --> 05:13.867
Don't?

05:13.869 --> 05:15.084
No, don't.

05:15.086 --> 05:17.287
I took Sergeant
Gormley to breakfast.

05:17.289 --> 05:19.672
He filled me in
on this squad,

05:19.674 --> 05:22.625
and said if I got any guff,
especially from you,

05:22.627 --> 05:25.044
he was my hook at One PP.

05:25.046 --> 05:28.181
Well, then I guess
we both have one.

05:28.183 --> 05:31.551
Except you can't
use yours, right?

05:33.521 --> 05:35.521
Welcome to the 5-4, Lieutenant.

05:38.643 --> 05:42.145
Interpol wants Brasha extradited
to stand trial in Serbia.

05:42.147 --> 05:44.230
“Wants” is
putting it lightly.

05:44.232 --> 05:46.366
On what charges?
The greatest hits--

05:46.368 --> 05:49.202
arms and heroin trafficking,
money laundering, murder.

05:49.204 --> 05:52.372
His crew's at the top of their
list, and he's the top guy.

05:52.374 --> 05:54.457
They're also the most difficult
to prosecute.

05:54.459 --> 05:55.742
Why?

05:55.744 --> 05:57.260
Because it's all family,

05:57.262 --> 05:59.295
either by blood
or by the economy

05:59.297 --> 06:01.748
that Brasha and his
businesses provide.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.132
Sergeant Gormley's here, sir.

06:03.134 --> 06:04.584
Thank you, Baker.

06:04.586 --> 06:06.836
What do we got?
As you can see,

06:06.838 --> 06:09.305
the size and angle
of the soda truck

06:09.307 --> 06:10.723
blocked the view
from the street.

06:10.725 --> 06:12.976
So we have no witnesses
to the actual attack.

06:12.978 --> 06:15.261
At least none that
have come forward.

06:15.263 --> 06:17.764
So the case will hinge
on the testimony of the victim.

06:17.766 --> 06:20.600
Who is currently being operated
on at St. Benjamin's Hospital.

06:20.602 --> 06:22.819
Boss, I think
we should let

06:22.821 --> 06:24.354
the extradition process begin.

06:24.356 --> 06:26.022
If Brasha slips past us again,

06:26.024 --> 06:28.524
the publicity for the department
is gonna be terrible.

06:29.611 --> 06:31.411
Rich Duncan.

06:31.413 --> 06:34.280
His kids are growing up
without a father.

06:34.282 --> 06:35.915
What does that mean?

06:35.917 --> 06:37.367
This isn't the first time

06:37.369 --> 06:39.786
Zoran Brasha lost his temper
on the street.

06:39.788 --> 06:42.171
Six years ago,
he got into a fight

06:42.173 --> 06:43.673
with an off-duty cop--

06:43.675 --> 06:46.960
Richard Duncan--
over a spilled drink.

06:46.962 --> 06:50.346
Brasha split the bar,
came back with a knife,

06:50.348 --> 06:53.182
and slit Duncan's throat
in the men's room.

06:53.184 --> 06:54.384
Geez.

06:54.386 --> 06:57.136
One of his crew
confessed to the crime.

06:57.138 --> 07:00.606
Still, why go against the odds
when Interpol says

07:00.608 --> 07:02.892
they can bring him to justice
over there?

07:02.894 --> 07:06.479
Because we own the arrest
and conviction of Zoran Brasha,

07:06.481 --> 07:08.114
not Interpol.

07:09.901 --> 07:12.652
You can tell them I said so.

07:17.242 --> 07:19.158
DANNY:
How's it going with Nicky?

07:19.160 --> 07:20.827
Nicky got into two more schools.
Wow.

07:20.829 --> 07:22.827
Looks like we got another genius
in the Reagan family.

07:22.851 --> 07:23.547
Mm-hmm.

07:23.548 --> 07:26.215
This one is not going to be
a cop, that's for sure.

07:26.217 --> 07:27.717
That's what we said
about Jamie, remember?

07:27.719 --> 07:28.835
(chuckles)

07:28.837 --> 07:30.219
What's college running
these days, anyway?

07:30.221 --> 07:33.723
(sighs) Housing and meals--
about $60,000 a year.

07:33.725 --> 07:35.892
A year?
Yep.

07:35.894 --> 07:37.777
You think I'm too old
to sell my body?

07:37.779 --> 07:39.829
No, not to science, anyway.

07:40.899 --> 07:43.066
Here he comes.
ERIN: Where's his counsel?

07:43.068 --> 07:46.019
It's time to start.

07:48.973 --> 07:50.206
Oh, no, not her.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.824
What do you mean, not her?

07:54.195 --> 07:56.913
Tori Parsons for the defense,
Your Honor. Sorry I'm late.

07:56.915 --> 07:58.414
BAILIFF:
This is a bail hearing.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.533
<i>The People of the</i>
<i>State of New York v.</i>

08:00.535 --> 08:03.286
<i>Zoran Brasha.</i>

08:03.288 --> 08:06.039
What's the People's application?

08:06.041 --> 08:08.674
With Mr. Brasha's
international network

08:08.676 --> 08:10.626
and vast financial resources,

08:10.628 --> 08:13.179
he is the very definition
of a flight risk, Your Honor.

08:13.181 --> 08:14.881
Coupled with the brutality
of the crime,

08:14.883 --> 08:17.433
we're asking the defendant
be held without bail

08:17.435 --> 08:18.935
until his trial.

08:20.271 --> 08:22.889
Your Honor, my client
has very deep ties

08:22.891 --> 08:25.391
with the ethnic Albanian
community in the Bronx,

08:25.393 --> 08:28.061
both personally
and professionally.

08:28.063 --> 08:29.228
He's not going anywhere.

08:29.230 --> 08:31.030
In fact, he's eager
for his day in court,

08:31.032 --> 08:33.566
so that he can prove his
innocence and clear his name.

08:33.568 --> 08:35.400
If he has to be remanded,
the defense feels

08:35.403 --> 08:37.070
that house arrest
is the most appropriate option.

08:37.072 --> 08:39.455
At the taxpayers' expense?

08:39.457 --> 08:40.490
Uh, no, Mr. Brasha's.

08:40.491 --> 08:41.741
Why should
the defendant

08:41.743 --> 08:44.310
be able to purchase
preferential treatment?

08:44.312 --> 08:46.496
And who's going
to vet Mr. Brasha's

08:46.498 --> 08:47.396
personal security?

08:47.398 --> 08:48.898
With his
criminal record

08:48.900 --> 08:50.416
and his long history
of violence,

08:50.418 --> 08:52.969
his freedom is a threat
to the community.

08:52.971 --> 08:55.888
I have to side
with the People in this matter.

08:55.890 --> 08:59.776
The defendant will be held
without bail at Rikers Island.

09:04.816 --> 09:06.816
Round one to you, Erin.

09:06.818 --> 09:08.935
But that's the last one
you'll win.

09:08.937 --> 09:10.186
Still keeping score, Tori?

09:10.188 --> 09:12.271
I thought you would have
given that up after law school.

09:12.273 --> 09:14.824
Oh, you know I never give up
on anything.

09:14.826 --> 09:16.275
Tori, this is my
brother Danny.

09:16.277 --> 09:18.411
Danny's actually
working the case.

09:18.413 --> 09:21.697
Danny, this is Tori Parsons;
graduated Columbia together.

09:21.699 --> 09:24.117
Your sister beat me out
for valedictorian,

09:24.119 --> 09:25.668
by percentage points.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.170
I wanted a recount.

09:27.172 --> 09:28.504
She's a smart girl.

09:28.506 --> 09:29.755
(chuckles)

09:29.757 --> 09:32.241
Is graduation really the
last time we saw each other?

09:32.243 --> 09:33.626
That's incredible.
I know.

09:33.628 --> 09:35.094
You back in New York now?

09:35.096 --> 09:37.130
My firm represents Mr. Brasha,
but his attorney's

09:37.132 --> 09:39.966
out of the country,
so they flew me in from Chicago.

09:39.968 --> 09:41.968
Well, you look fantastic.

09:41.970 --> 09:44.637
Thank you.
Hey, you want to grab lunch?

09:44.639 --> 09:46.606
You can pick the place.

09:46.608 --> 09:48.057
Don't worry, I'm buying.

09:48.059 --> 09:50.276
Well, with those shoes,
you better be.

09:52.981 --> 09:55.598
How is life,
besides work?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.784
The last time I saw you,
you were dating that drummer.

09:58.786 --> 10:01.704
Remember, he was always high,
he never wore a shirt?

10:01.706 --> 10:03.656
Yeah. That's Mark.

10:03.658 --> 10:05.491
I married him.

10:05.493 --> 10:06.792
You married him?

10:06.794 --> 10:07.827
Mm-hmm.

10:07.829 --> 10:09.745
(laughs)
That's my guy.

10:09.747 --> 10:12.748
I work high-profile cases
all over the world,

10:12.750 --> 10:14.483
and he takes care
of the kids.

10:14.485 --> 10:16.502
He's great.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.554
How's, um...

10:18.556 --> 10:20.506
Oh, what was his name again?

10:20.508 --> 10:22.842
Jack. Now, that is
a good-looking man.

10:24.395 --> 10:25.845
Oh. Sorry.

10:25.847 --> 10:27.897
Did you guys...
That's okay. Things happen.

10:27.899 --> 10:29.565
Our daughter's
fantastic though.

10:29.567 --> 10:30.850
Every college wants her.

10:30.852 --> 10:33.686
College--
it's pricey these days.

10:33.688 --> 10:36.989
You might have to come over
to the dark side with me.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.991
(chuckles) I have seen
your client list.

10:38.993 --> 10:41.027
I don't have the stomach for it.
(chuckles)

10:41.029 --> 10:43.362
You'll never change, Erin.
I know that.

10:43.364 --> 10:45.031
Your father's the commissioner.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.582
Your brothers
are on the job.

10:46.584 --> 10:47.867
I bet you still have

10:47.869 --> 10:50.036
those Sunday dinners
after church.

10:50.038 --> 10:52.755
It's a good, solid life.

10:54.926 --> 10:56.842
Let's talk Zoran Brasha.

10:56.844 --> 10:59.879
Just to be clear, we won't
accept any plea bargains.

10:59.881 --> 11:02.048
Your client has had
a nice long run of it,

11:02.050 --> 11:04.050
but he's not gonna wiggle
out of it this time.

11:04.052 --> 11:07.386
Zoran has “wiggled out” because
he's an innocent businessman

11:07.388 --> 11:10.389
who's been continually harassed
by law enforcement.

11:10.391 --> 11:12.725
Save it for the press, Tori.
Do you know how much

11:12.727 --> 11:14.560
he's done
for the Albanian community?

11:14.562 --> 11:16.479
He's hired them
in his businesses,

11:16.481 --> 11:19.565
given them resources,
affordable housing.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.701
I mean, he is a good man, Erin.

11:21.703 --> 11:24.870
John Coogan would disagree,
and so would the evidence.

11:24.872 --> 11:26.656
You mean the blood
on Zoran's shirt?

11:26.658 --> 11:29.875
He tried to help Coogan
after another man assaulted him.

11:29.877 --> 11:31.911
Is that really the story
you're going with? (phone ringing)

11:31.913 --> 11:32.745
It's the truth.

11:32.747 --> 11:34.880
(scoffs) Reagan.

11:38.052 --> 11:40.386
Okay, thank you.

11:40.388 --> 11:43.639
John Coogan is out of surgery
and ready to talk.

11:43.641 --> 11:46.559
I guess we'll see
what the truth is.

11:51.599 --> 11:53.666
How you feeling, John?

11:53.668 --> 11:55.935
I'm...

11:55.937 --> 11:59.939
drinking my lunch
through a straw.

11:59.941 --> 12:01.857
How do you think?

12:01.859 --> 12:04.243
Sorry, Detective.
John's just upset.

12:04.245 --> 12:07.330
He hasn't lost a fight
since the fifth grade.

12:07.332 --> 12:09.165
Is that how long
you've known him?

12:09.167 --> 12:11.667
Since before that.

12:11.669 --> 12:13.703
DANNY: I know it's been
quite an ordeal for you, John.

12:13.705 --> 12:16.289
Can you tell me what happened?

12:16.291 --> 12:18.791
We...

12:18.793 --> 12:22.545
argued over... a parking spot.

12:24.632 --> 12:26.632
And then he bashed me
in the back

12:26.634 --> 12:30.136
of the head with a tire iron.

12:30.138 --> 12:31.304
Okay.

12:31.306 --> 12:34.023
Would you be willing
to testify in court?

12:34.025 --> 12:36.859
You bet.

12:38.363 --> 12:39.895
Look,

12:39.897 --> 12:43.983
I know he's supposed to be...

12:43.985 --> 12:47.670
some kind of scary mobster...

12:50.491 --> 12:54.660
...but only a punk
would hit a man from behind.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.751
He's going to jail.

13:01.753 --> 13:03.486
Reagan, you're
gonna want

13:03.488 --> 13:04.670
to see this.

13:11.095 --> 13:13.346
Where the hell
did this come from?

13:13.348 --> 13:16.766
A young guy just left it.
He was just here.

13:27.028 --> 13:28.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:28.496 --> 13:30.780
Police. Come here.
Whoa. Hey, man!

13:30.782 --> 13:32.415
Come here. Who sent you?
(grunts)

13:32.417 --> 13:34.417
Parkview Florists.

13:34.419 --> 13:38.204
You work there?
Yeah, it's my parents' store.

13:38.206 --> 13:40.289
This message--
where'd it come from?

13:40.291 --> 13:43.359
Uh, it was dropped off
by a messenger. Why?

13:44.212 --> 13:46.379
Get the hell out of here.

13:47.882 --> 13:49.882
Just a delivery guy.

13:49.884 --> 13:51.884
We need more unis
on this floor.

13:51.886 --> 13:53.219
Scour the floor with them.

13:53.221 --> 13:55.855
And we need RMPs outside
his house when he's released.

13:55.857 --> 13:57.523
Brasha's coming for him.

14:09.957 --> 14:12.090
Come on. You got to stop
running. Come on, Jamie.

14:12.092 --> 14:14.209
There we go. Yeah.

14:14.211 --> 14:17.295
Wallop. Wallop. Hit, hit.

14:17.297 --> 14:19.297
Got to get in the pocket.

14:19.299 --> 14:21.717
Watch the jab.
Watch the jab.

14:21.719 --> 14:23.018
Watch the jab. You got
to protect your chin.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.219
Come right over the top.

14:24.221 --> 14:26.888
Work! Come on, Jamie, work!

14:26.890 --> 14:29.558
Come on. Show me that pit bull!
(barking)

14:29.560 --> 14:31.193
(bell dings)

14:31.195 --> 14:32.894
That was good. That was good.

14:32.896 --> 14:34.229
Good round, good round.

14:34.231 --> 14:35.197
Hey.

14:35.199 --> 14:36.865
What's with
all the dancing?

14:36.867 --> 14:38.233
This ain't no disco.
What are you doing here?

14:38.235 --> 14:39.718
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

14:39.720 --> 14:41.737
I came to watch. Hey!

14:41.739 --> 14:43.872
Rico Ramirez.
I am, yeah.

14:43.874 --> 14:44.906
I saw you in the Golden Gloves.

14:44.908 --> 14:46.241
Yeah, you're a hell
of a fighter.

14:46.243 --> 14:47.542
Not with this boot
I'm not, right?

14:47.544 --> 14:48.660
Yeah, tough break.

14:48.662 --> 14:50.162
I was actually gonna try

14:50.164 --> 14:52.831
and restart my career
off of this fight. So yeah.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.249
Well, lucky for us,

14:54.251 --> 14:56.218
we got you helping out
with the kid.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.469
Hey, I'm gonna do whatever
I can for the cause.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.171
Well, as you can see,
the cause needs a lot of help.

14:59.173 --> 15:01.006
What are you doing here?
You trying to fox-trot this guy

15:01.008 --> 15:01.646
into a decision?

15:01.670 --> 15:03.427
Hit and don't be hit, Danny--
that's boxing.

15:03.427 --> 15:05.093
Yeah, but you can't win
that way.

15:05.095 --> 15:07.929
He's not gonna
win no way.

15:07.931 --> 15:10.599
Hey! Jimmy Wallace.

15:10.601 --> 15:11.983
What's wrong?

15:11.985 --> 15:13.685
No cats stuck up
in a tree today?

15:13.687 --> 15:15.604
Is your brother gonna fight
with ballet slippers?

15:15.606 --> 15:16.988
'Cause I think my
eight-year-old daughter's

15:16.990 --> 15:18.523
got a pair he could borrow.

15:18.525 --> 15:20.942
Is that your daughter?
No offense, she's even uglier

15:20.944 --> 15:22.027
than you.

15:22.029 --> 15:23.278
No, that's my cousin Emmett,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.430
and he's gonna kick
your brother's ass.

15:25.432 --> 15:27.199
(chuckling)

15:27.201 --> 15:28.784
Let me tell you something,
if he even dreams

15:28.786 --> 15:31.169
about beating a Reagan,
he better wake up and apologize.

15:31.171 --> 15:32.047
Want to bet on that?

15:32.071 --> 15:34.071
As long as it's not
for his medical bills.

15:34.124 --> 15:36.091
All right,
how 'bout, uh,

15:36.093 --> 15:38.126
dinner at Peter Luger's
for our whole units?

15:38.128 --> 15:39.344
Loser buys.

15:39.346 --> 15:42.380
Oh, I like steak
just as much as the next guy.

15:42.382 --> 15:43.799
You got a bet.

15:43.801 --> 15:45.383
All right, but this fight's
gonna be fair, Danny,

15:45.385 --> 15:48.687
'cause I'm not gonna let your
daddy fix the judges this time.

15:48.689 --> 15:51.523
You know, I kicked your ass
fair and square, Jimmy.

15:51.525 --> 15:53.358
And I don't appreciate
you impugning

15:53.360 --> 15:55.627
my old man's stellar reputation
with your...

15:55.629 --> 15:58.480
inflammatory remarks
and accusations.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.482
Don't hurt yourself
with those SAT words.

16:00.484 --> 16:03.368
Beat it.
Take your daughter with you.

16:04.621 --> 16:07.155
You better knock him out.
We got a bet now.

16:07.157 --> 16:10.041
Hey, dinner for the whole unit?
That's, like, a $2,000 bet.

16:10.043 --> 16:12.210
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one that made the bet.

16:12.212 --> 16:13.879
Besides, you got me
in your corner. You can't lose.

16:13.881 --> 16:14.830
I got faith in you, kid.

16:14.832 --> 16:16.665
No, Rico's training me.
Good.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.667
The more the merrier.
Right, Rico?

16:18.669 --> 16:20.218
There we go.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.721
What's Jack going as
for Halloween?

16:22.723 --> 16:25.056
What?
Sean?

16:25.058 --> 16:26.925
What are you getting at?
Well, you got extra time

16:26.927 --> 16:28.977
on your hands, there's
other places you should be.

16:28.979 --> 16:29.928
Come on.

16:29.930 --> 16:31.313
I smell Dad.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.765
No, this is me telling you
I got this covered.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.150
No, it's Dad.

16:35.152 --> 16:37.936
I can smell the bay rum and
cigars coming out of your pores.

16:37.938 --> 16:39.521
Stop with all the dancing, okay?

16:39.523 --> 16:41.940
Teach him how to fight
like a man, Rico.

16:44.695 --> 16:47.028
DANNY: If you recognize anyone,
let me know their number

16:47.030 --> 16:48.496
and where you
recognize them from.

16:48.498 --> 16:49.865
If you want a closer look

16:49.867 --> 16:51.917
or a different angle,
you let me know.

16:51.919 --> 16:53.168
I'll have them step forward.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.536
Okay, John?

16:57.641 --> 16:58.924
Two.

16:58.926 --> 17:01.042
Not him.
Doing great, John.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.128
Take your time.

17:03.130 --> 17:04.896
Mm.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.048
Number four.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.307
John?

17:17.060 --> 17:18.310
You sure?
Why don't you take

17:18.311 --> 17:20.228
a little bit
of a closer look, okay?

17:20.230 --> 17:20.896
Detective,

17:20.897 --> 17:21.897
he already responded.

17:21.898 --> 17:23.231
You know better than that.

17:23.233 --> 17:24.616
ERIN: And you know
better than to speak

17:24.617 --> 17:25.733
in front of my witness.

17:25.736 --> 17:27.068
Maybe him.

17:27.069 --> 17:28.954
Number five.

17:28.956 --> 17:31.072
Number five?

17:31.074 --> 17:32.691
No, wait.

17:32.693 --> 17:34.793
I think it might be number two.

17:34.795 --> 17:36.578
Number two?

17:36.580 --> 17:38.046
You heard him, number two.
I didn't hear him

17:38.048 --> 17:39.414
say “number two.”
I heard him say

17:39.416 --> 17:43.084
“maybe number two”
or “maybe number five.” John?

17:50.594 --> 17:52.560
Hold on. John.

17:52.562 --> 17:54.596
John.

17:54.598 --> 17:56.097
What are you doing?

17:56.099 --> 17:58.099
We're getting you round-
the-clock protection, okay?

17:58.101 --> 17:59.601
What the hell happened in there?

17:59.603 --> 18:02.437
Can you...

18:02.439 --> 18:05.190
protect us... from this?

18:05.192 --> 18:07.626
That's my niece.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.944
They followed her

18:08.946 --> 18:10.946
on her way to school
this morning.

18:10.948 --> 18:13.448
I got this
just before I got here.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.866
You didn't mention
a niece, okay?

18:14.868 --> 18:16.368
She wasn't on any list.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.669
Because she lives in Delaware.

18:17.671 --> 18:19.404
I didn't even

18:19.406 --> 18:20.839
think about it.

18:20.841 --> 18:22.791
All right. I'll take the phone.

18:22.793 --> 18:24.292
We'll trace the number,
we'll get her

18:24.294 --> 18:26.845
protection, too.
No. No. No.

18:26.847 --> 18:29.764
Look, if it was just me,
I wouldn't care.

18:29.766 --> 18:31.132
But...

18:31.134 --> 18:33.385
They said they'd mail her
back to us in pieces

18:33.387 --> 18:35.520
if John didn't do
what they wanted.

18:36.390 --> 18:40.025
Look, I'm not
some freedom fighter.

18:41.345 --> 18:43.695
I'm just an ordinary guy.

18:43.697 --> 18:45.814
I'm sorry.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.487
Your client intimidated
my witness.

18:52.489 --> 18:54.072
My client's innocent.

18:54.074 --> 18:55.907
He didn't have
to do anything.

18:55.909 --> 18:58.493
No victim I.D.,
no witnesses,

18:58.495 --> 19:00.495
just circumstantial
evidence.

19:00.497 --> 19:02.380
I'll petition the judge
for house arrest,

19:02.382 --> 19:03.748
and this time I'll get it.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.835
Zoran Brasha will be with
his family having dinner,

19:06.837 --> 19:08.470
where he belongs.

19:08.472 --> 19:11.172
If you still want to empanel
a grand jury, go ahead.

19:11.174 --> 19:12.724
It's the
People's money.

19:12.726 --> 19:15.560
I see my share
of sleazy defense lawyers,

19:15.562 --> 19:17.579
but you have overachieved
once again.

19:17.581 --> 19:18.847
Wait, I'm sleazy?

19:18.849 --> 19:20.849
An innocent man
is getting railroaded

19:20.851 --> 19:22.684
by a police commissioner
with a grudge.

19:22.686 --> 19:25.153
Innocent man?
Have you looked at his record?

19:25.155 --> 19:27.739
Do you even know
what he did in Serbia?

19:27.741 --> 19:28.990
He's a monster.

19:28.992 --> 19:30.825
And you protect him,
you are no better.

19:30.827 --> 19:33.661
And no pair of shoes
is worth that.

19:33.663 --> 19:37.699
We are both playing
the same game, Erin.

19:37.701 --> 19:40.435
Don't you dare judge me.

19:42.039 --> 19:44.089
I offered him every protection
under the sun.

19:44.091 --> 19:45.957
He still wouldn't cooperate.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.876
Well, find another way.

19:47.878 --> 19:50.211
Shake down the neighborhood
where Brasha attacked him.

19:50.213 --> 19:52.547
Somebody must have
seen something.

19:52.549 --> 19:55.050
Whatever it takes.

19:55.886 --> 19:57.001
What?

19:57.003 --> 19:58.053
I'll come back.

19:58.055 --> 20:01.723
(sighs)
Brasha got to Coogan.

20:01.725 --> 20:04.642
He wouldn't I.D. him
in a lineup.

20:04.644 --> 20:07.896
This was a risk, Frank.

20:07.898 --> 20:10.065
Brasha doesn't play fair.

20:11.985 --> 20:14.702
Just because he strong-armed
the victim

20:14.704 --> 20:17.072
doesn't mean we're gonna fold.

20:17.074 --> 20:19.674
No, but it makes it harder,
especially if he wants to run.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.326
(sighs)

20:21.328 --> 20:22.811
What'd you want?

20:22.813 --> 20:24.479
It can wait.

20:24.481 --> 20:27.082
No. Come on.

20:28.835 --> 20:32.303
I got a call from a reporter
at <i> The Washington Post</i>

20:32.305 --> 20:35.140
with a source saying that State

20:35.142 --> 20:37.258
is stepping in
on behalf of Interpol

20:37.260 --> 20:39.210
in extraditing
Zoran Brasha.

20:39.212 --> 20:41.513
(sighs)

20:41.515 --> 20:43.932
And they want my reaction?

20:43.934 --> 20:45.266
No.

20:45.268 --> 20:46.568
It's a friend.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.987
Off the record.
Just information.

20:50.774 --> 20:54.609
Our nation's capital votes--
no confidence.

20:54.611 --> 20:56.344
It's not like that.

20:56.346 --> 20:59.080
Yes, it is.

20:59.082 --> 21:02.534
Just... do me
one favor, Garrett?

21:02.536 --> 21:04.953
I would never say
“I told you so.”

21:04.955 --> 21:08.006
Thank you.

21:11.294 --> 21:14.429
Go home and see
your kids, Detective.

21:14.431 --> 21:16.381
My old man get to you, too?

21:16.383 --> 21:18.766
What? No.

21:18.768 --> 21:20.969
Come on, now.
It's quitting time.

21:20.971 --> 21:23.521
Richie Duncan
can't go home tonight.

21:23.523 --> 21:24.939
Neither can I.

21:24.941 --> 21:28.560
Burning yourself out is not
gonna bring Duncan back.

21:28.562 --> 21:31.146
Now, come on and
get some rest.

21:31.148 --> 21:33.565
This case will still be
here in the morning.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.233
I don't need the Vic
to crack the case.

21:35.235 --> 21:36.534
I'll find something.

21:36.536 --> 21:38.987
What you got there?

21:38.989 --> 21:41.156
Worker's statements from
the bodega across the street.

21:41.158 --> 21:43.992
They were on the east side,
nothing was blocking their view,

21:43.994 --> 21:46.744
so I'm looking
for inconsistencies or holes.

21:46.746 --> 21:47.912
You find anything yet?

21:47.914 --> 21:48.997
I'm just getting started,

21:48.999 --> 21:50.832
but somebody must have
seen something.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.383
You have a good night, boss.

21:52.385 --> 21:54.586
(sighs)

21:58.725 --> 22:00.642
I knew him.

22:00.644 --> 22:02.844
Richie Duncan.
Worked with him

22:02.846 --> 22:05.346
at the 3-6.

22:05.348 --> 22:09.267
He was a good guy, great cop.

22:11.071 --> 22:14.189
But you keep something
like that to yourself?

22:14.191 --> 22:18.443
I always try
to keep my emotions in check.

22:48.459 --> 22:49.899
I already told
the other detective.

22:51.008 --> 22:52.924
I was in my office in the back

22:52.926 --> 22:55.510
when I heard some horns honking,
then yelling.

22:55.512 --> 22:57.929
I went out to see
what was going on,

22:57.931 --> 23:00.682
and I saw the man
standing over the delivery guy

23:00.684 --> 23:02.100
with the tire iron.

23:02.102 --> 23:04.436
But you didn't see a
single blow thrown, huh?

23:04.438 --> 23:05.604
No, it was over.

23:05.606 --> 23:07.839
How about the video cameras?
They catch anything?

23:07.841 --> 23:12.194
No. Tapes automatically
wipes out every 24 hours.

23:12.196 --> 23:13.695
Uh-huh. Well,
it was 9:00 a.m.

23:13.697 --> 23:16.031
Maybe it was the beginning
of a 24-hour cycle.

23:16.033 --> 23:18.450
I don't know.
The camera never works right.

23:18.452 --> 23:20.202
So the camera's broken?

23:20.204 --> 23:22.170
Yes.

23:22.172 --> 23:24.256
Okay. See, you got me
a little confused now,

23:24.258 --> 23:26.041
because first you said
the tape was wiped,

23:26.043 --> 23:27.709
now you're saying
the camera was broken.

23:27.711 --> 23:28.960
Which one was it?

23:28.962 --> 23:30.545
Look, we don't have the tape.

23:30.547 --> 23:32.714
That's what matters, right?

23:32.716 --> 23:34.683
Wrong. You know
what I think?

23:34.685 --> 23:36.802
I think Brasha might
have gotten to you.

23:36.804 --> 23:38.720
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:38.722 --> 23:40.605
No, I think you
do. Who's he?

23:40.607 --> 23:44.392
That's Rey Santiago.
He's the manager.

23:44.394 --> 23:46.895
He runs the place,
he opens the store,

23:46.897 --> 23:48.897
handles the delivery guy.
So he would have

23:48.899 --> 23:50.816
been the guy to sign
for the delivery

23:50.818 --> 23:52.701
from Coogan on
Tuesday when he came?

23:52.703 --> 23:54.653
Oh, yes,
he's the one who signs.

23:54.655 --> 23:55.904
Santiago,

23:55.906 --> 23:57.706
Detective Reagan.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.292
You, uh, tell me what happened,
what you saw?

24:04.665 --> 24:07.582
DANNY: Rey Santiago was waiting
on John Coogan's delivery.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.835
Saw the whole thing.
He's willing to testify.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.254
Won't hold up.

24:12.256 --> 24:14.005
DANNY: What do you mean,
it won't hold up?

24:14.007 --> 24:15.974
Eyewitness testimony?
Since when?

24:15.976 --> 24:17.392
If we're lucky enough
to go to trial,

24:17.394 --> 24:18.593
the defense is going to argue

24:18.595 --> 24:19.928
that Rey Santiago
would be willing

24:19.930 --> 24:22.647
to say anything we wanted
to avoid deportation.

24:22.649 --> 24:24.482
His testimony
will be tainted.

24:24.484 --> 24:25.934
Even if it's true?

24:25.936 --> 24:27.235
You need more.

24:27.237 --> 24:29.187
You want to weigh in
on this, Dad?

24:31.275 --> 24:33.491
Dinner's ready.

24:36.439 --> 24:38.851
So what's the deal with
you two guys and Jimmy Wallace?

24:38.852 --> 24:39.885
It was like the Hatfields

24:39.886 --> 24:40.952
and McCoys today at the gym.

24:40.953 --> 24:41.486
(laughs)

24:41.487 --> 24:42.902
Danny fought Jimmy in '06.

24:42.904 --> 24:45.238
Yeah, while you were
away at college.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.340
It was a hell of a fight.

24:47.342 --> 24:49.709
The Dentist versus The Cobbler--

24:49.711 --> 24:51.211
Tooth and Nail.

24:51.213 --> 24:52.662
Danny won by a...

24:52.664 --> 24:55.715
mm, a pretty close margin,
and there was almost

24:55.717 --> 24:57.667
a riot in the crowd.

24:57.669 --> 24:59.640
The fight actually
wasn't that close.

24:59.641 --> 25:00.641
Well...

25:00.642 --> 25:01.858
Hell of a fight.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.226
HENRY:
And later on,

25:03.228 --> 25:04.394
we were all having
a drink together,

25:04.396 --> 25:06.312
and one of the judges
from the fight

25:06.314 --> 25:08.314
was sitting on a stool
next to your father.

25:08.316 --> 25:10.316
And the Wallaces--

25:10.318 --> 25:12.151
Jimmy's dad was
an FDNY captain--

25:12.153 --> 25:14.153
he got it
through his head

25:14.155 --> 25:16.990
that this was proof positive
that Francis

25:16.992 --> 25:19.659
had fixed the bout.
(chuckles)

25:19.661 --> 25:21.744
It became a feud.
LINDA: Especially since

25:21.746 --> 25:23.546
Danny wouldn't fight Jimmy
again the next year.

25:23.548 --> 25:26.215
Well, why would I fight him
again? I already beat the guy.

25:26.217 --> 25:29.118
Oh, that's right.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.254
Because you actually
thought he beat me instead.

25:31.256 --> 25:32.722
What?

25:32.724 --> 25:34.390
Well, it's supposed to be
effective aggressiveness, Danny.

25:34.392 --> 25:36.843
I just think he outboxed you
fair and square.

25:36.845 --> 25:37.894
(laughter, groaning)

25:37.896 --> 25:39.896
ERIN:
Honesty is

25:39.898 --> 25:41.014
the key to a good marriage.

25:41.016 --> 25:42.181
Well, don't worry.

25:42.183 --> 25:43.683
You'll love
Jamie's fighting style.

25:43.685 --> 25:45.518
I learned to fight
in the Marines,

25:45.520 --> 25:47.687
he learned himself at Harvard.
Give me a break, Danny.

25:47.689 --> 25:49.188
If you wanted to go
to a better school,

25:49.190 --> 25:50.907
you should've paid attention to
something other than shop class.

25:50.909 --> 25:52.108
Keep it civil.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.359
That's okay.
We're gonna need

25:53.361 --> 25:55.511
that kind of fire from him
when he gets in the ring.

25:55.513 --> 25:56.529
True.

25:56.531 --> 25:57.697
What are you two guys

25:57.699 --> 25:58.865
going as for Halloween, huh?

25:58.867 --> 26:00.199
SpongeBob.

26:00.201 --> 26:01.584
I'm not really
dressing up anymore.

26:01.586 --> 26:02.952
JAMIE:
No?

26:02.954 --> 26:04.871
I have personally
carved out time

26:04.873 --> 26:06.539
to take both of them
to some of

26:06.541 --> 26:07.707
New York's
scariest neighborhoods.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.592
To trick-or-treat.

26:09.594 --> 26:10.877
(Linda laughs)

26:10.879 --> 26:11.928
Nicky, what are you going as?

26:11.930 --> 26:14.097
I am going as Miss Anxious

26:14.099 --> 26:15.498
College Applicant.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.716
What's that costume?

26:16.718 --> 26:18.217
You're looking at it.

26:18.219 --> 26:19.886
ERIN: What do you have
to be anxious about?

26:19.888 --> 26:22.305
You got into seven out of the
ten schools you applied to.

26:22.307 --> 26:23.523
Mom, I'm a Reagan.

26:23.525 --> 26:25.108
Something good happens,
that just means

26:25.110 --> 26:26.809
something bad is
right around the corner.

26:26.811 --> 26:28.227
(Henry laughs)

26:28.229 --> 26:29.529
Good motto.

26:29.531 --> 26:30.730
Served me well.

26:30.732 --> 26:33.483
Smart kid.

26:33.485 --> 26:34.984
Of course I'm excited.

26:34.986 --> 26:35.986
I'm thrilled.

26:35.987 --> 26:37.687
I'm just worried
about money.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.373
I don't want her graduating
with a $100,000 debt.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.908
It's no way to start a life.

26:41.910 --> 26:44.210
And where is your ex-husband
in all this?

26:44.212 --> 26:46.546
I have spoken to Jack,
and, of course,

26:46.548 --> 26:48.164
he's gonna do what he can,

26:48.166 --> 26:50.550
but he just bought
a new home, and

26:50.552 --> 26:53.136
his money is vested in the
new firm, and it's not liquid,

26:53.138 --> 26:54.138
and...

26:54.139 --> 26:56.155
I don't like the guy.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.907
Okay, can we not
get into that right now?

26:57.909 --> 27:01.511
You know...

27:01.513 --> 27:03.513
I shouldn't have to remind you

27:03.515 --> 27:07.233
that everyone I know named
Reagan worked at college,

27:07.235 --> 27:08.601
helped pull their weight.

27:08.603 --> 27:10.186
I know, and Nicky will, too,

27:10.188 --> 27:12.522
but it's ten times
more expensive now, Dad.

27:12.524 --> 27:15.224
I know that.

27:15.226 --> 27:17.977
I'm thinking about going
into private practice.

27:20.115 --> 27:23.783
There are advantages,
not just financial.

27:23.785 --> 27:26.786
With Nicky leaving,
it'd be a good opportunity

27:26.788 --> 27:29.489
for me to spread my wings,
have new challenges.

27:29.491 --> 27:32.625
Outside your old man's purview?

27:32.627 --> 27:34.794
Actually, I go back and forth,

27:34.796 --> 27:37.380
putting that in the plus
or minus column.

27:38.767 --> 27:42.051
Look... I know money's an issue.

27:43.054 --> 27:45.021
If I can help,
you only need to ask.

27:45.023 --> 27:46.706
I'm not.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.891
Okay. I...

27:50.695 --> 27:53.062
(sighs)

27:53.064 --> 27:56.449
But please consider this.

27:56.451 --> 27:58.401
The brass ring in a career

27:58.403 --> 28:02.538
isn't the number
of zeros on your paycheck.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.742
It's when
you become indispensable.

28:08.079 --> 28:10.680
And you are.

28:11.516 --> 28:13.966
Thank you, Dad.

28:16.087 --> 28:18.337
I'm just not sure
I have the luxury

28:18.339 --> 28:20.590
to think that way right now.

28:22.744 --> 28:26.395
Nicky deserves
the best... chance.

28:30.518 --> 28:33.569
A number of firms have tried
to recruit me over the years,

28:33.571 --> 28:37.190
so I'm just taking a look
at what's out there.

28:39.077 --> 28:41.110
She's lucky to have you.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.267
So, you called them
in here, didn't you?

29:04.269 --> 29:06.886
Nope. You serve food,
you get inspected.

29:06.888 --> 29:08.137
That's the law.

29:08.139 --> 29:10.723
Cuchifritos look damn good,
by the way.

29:10.725 --> 29:12.058
What about <i> La Migra,</i> huh?

29:12.060 --> 29:13.559
They're investigating
all of my workers.

29:13.561 --> 29:15.278
Is that just a coincidence, too?

29:15.280 --> 29:17.446
I don't know.
And you're gonna

29:17.448 --> 29:18.815
get me closed down, man.

29:18.817 --> 29:21.818
Everything I own is right here
in this place!

29:21.820 --> 29:23.152
Maybe you help us find

29:23.154 --> 29:26.405
that video and, uh, we can put
the brakes on this for you.

29:26.407 --> 29:27.874
You're a gangster, too,

29:27.876 --> 29:30.076
just like
Zoran Brasha.

29:30.078 --> 29:31.911
Same tactics.

29:31.913 --> 29:33.412
Suit yourself.

29:33.414 --> 29:36.632
Uh, Mr. Ortiz,
I'm Lieutenant Carver.

29:36.634 --> 29:39.335
I want to assure you
that protection can be

29:39.337 --> 29:40.837
provided around the clock.

29:40.839 --> 29:43.089
We can even relocate you
and your family

29:43.091 --> 29:45.091
until after the trial is over.

29:45.093 --> 29:47.927
Yeah, then after you get
what you want,

29:47.929 --> 29:50.346
who is gonna protect me then?

29:50.348 --> 29:53.599
You'll just have to trust us.

30:06.668 --> 30:08.735
WOMAN:
This is a big tent firm, Erin.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.987
Yes, we handle hard-core
crime cases,

30:10.989 --> 30:12.155
but we also have attorneys

30:12.157 --> 30:15.642
on everything
from the Keystone Pipeline

30:15.644 --> 30:17.961
to defending the civil liberties
of the Guantanamo Three.

30:17.963 --> 30:20.580
We also do incredible
pro Bono work

30:20.582 --> 30:22.048
with the Innocence Project.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.584
Our offices are
in New York, Chicago, L.A.,

30:24.586 --> 30:25.969
Mexico City and London.

30:25.971 --> 30:28.671
You can not only choose
your cases, but your location.

30:28.673 --> 30:30.640
It's a very unique shop.

30:30.642 --> 30:32.558
And despite what
you may have heard,

30:32.560 --> 30:35.094
we really are on the
side of the angels.

30:35.096 --> 30:37.180
You sure I can't
pour you a glass?

30:37.182 --> 30:39.565
Tempting, but I am
working today.

30:39.567 --> 30:41.067
We're not above
getting you drunk, you know.

30:41.069 --> 30:42.069
(laughter)

30:42.070 --> 30:43.353
Or stalking you, apparently.

30:43.355 --> 30:45.905
Well, I'm glad
you've been persistent.

30:45.907 --> 30:48.992
It's, um... it's a big move.

30:48.994 --> 30:52.278
We know.
And we don't take it lightly.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.197
With your pedigree,

30:54.199 --> 30:57.033
we're prepared to bring you in
at the partner level

30:57.035 --> 30:59.035
and compensate you
accordingly.

31:00.789 --> 31:04.157
Let me put you
in the neighborhood.

31:04.159 --> 31:06.542
Next sound you hear

31:06.544 --> 31:09.712
will be your jaw
hitting the ground.

31:14.269 --> 31:16.219
Wow.

31:16.221 --> 31:18.805
We don't want you to meet
with anyone else.

31:18.807 --> 31:20.973
(phone vibrating)

31:20.975 --> 31:23.443
Excuse me.
I am working on a case.

31:23.445 --> 31:25.061
Of course.

31:25.063 --> 31:27.397
WOMAN:
Good news?

31:27.399 --> 31:28.715
MAN:
Not for the defendant.

31:28.717 --> 31:29.882
Am I right?

31:29.884 --> 31:31.367
(laughter)

31:31.369 --> 31:33.403
I hope that's the last man
you put away.

31:34.823 --> 31:38.658
Your offer is overwhelming.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.743
Can I have 24 hours to consider?

31:42.297 --> 31:45.581
Been waiting for you this long;
what's another day?

31:45.583 --> 31:47.300
Thank you.

31:47.302 --> 31:48.501
Thank you.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.737
(officers shouting)
Move, move, move!

32:07.739 --> 32:09.021
Go! Go!

32:09.023 --> 32:10.690
Police!

32:10.692 --> 32:12.191
Everybody on the ground!
Move!

32:12.193 --> 32:14.360
Move it, move it!

32:15.947 --> 32:17.330
Police!

32:17.332 --> 32:19.499
Go! Go!

32:32.797 --> 32:35.014
OFFICER:
Clear!

32:36.184 --> 32:38.050
Clear!

32:38.853 --> 32:40.686
Clear!

32:42.524 --> 32:43.773
House is clear.

32:43.775 --> 32:45.775
What do you mean? What do you
mean, the house is clear?

32:45.777 --> 32:47.310
Supposed to be watching him
around the clock.

32:47.312 --> 32:50.446
We were. We got units
in front and in the back.

32:50.448 --> 32:52.482
Reagan, I got something.

33:03.912 --> 33:05.962
DANNY: Son of a bitch
must have shimmied through.

33:05.964 --> 33:08.247
Goes all the way through
to another house.

33:08.249 --> 33:10.483
He must own
both properties.

33:12.487 --> 33:15.388
Teflon.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.823
Damn it.

33:19.994 --> 33:23.296
I haven't been able to get
in touch with Mr. Brasha either.

33:23.298 --> 33:25.031
My guess is
he's left the country.

33:25.033 --> 33:28.234
Your guess? You tipped him off
that he was being arrested.

33:28.236 --> 33:29.969
You probably
arranged for his travel.

33:29.971 --> 33:31.304
That's hindering prosecution--
a felony.

33:31.306 --> 33:32.538
I could have you...

33:32.540 --> 33:35.408
That won't stick,
and you know it.

33:35.410 --> 33:38.377
Hasn't this office
been embarrassed enough?

33:38.379 --> 33:40.613
I didn't hear you deny it.

33:42.484 --> 33:45.001
I didn't come here to negotiate.

33:45.003 --> 33:47.203
I came to say good-bye.

33:47.205 --> 33:50.373
Who knows--
could be another 15 years

33:50.375 --> 33:52.091
until we see each other again.

33:53.495 --> 33:54.877
Take care, Erin.

33:54.879 --> 33:56.445
The tape.

33:56.447 --> 33:59.131
You haven't
seen it, have you?

34:01.853 --> 34:04.020
It's pretty interesting.

34:23.257 --> 34:26.125
There's no question
of your client's guilt, Tori.

34:26.127 --> 34:27.409
That's what happened.

34:27.411 --> 34:30.079
He's done it before, and if
we leave him on the street,

34:30.081 --> 34:31.414
he's gonna do it again.

34:33.668 --> 34:36.002
A good defense attorney

34:36.004 --> 34:39.922
gets their client off
any way they can.

34:39.924 --> 34:42.308
I don't even think about it.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.592
(chuckles softly)

34:43.594 --> 34:46.245
You can't do the job
any other way.

34:46.246 --> 34:49.181
That is the job, isn't it?

34:51.786 --> 34:53.436
All those victims.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.338
That blood is on you, too.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.907
You're a brilliant
lawyer, Tori,

34:57.909 --> 35:00.243
tough as nails.

35:00.245 --> 35:03.980
But isn't there a line
somewhere?

35:03.982 --> 35:06.616
The name on Brasha's

35:06.618 --> 35:09.051
new passport--
that's all I need.

35:09.888 --> 35:11.854
You know I can't give you that.

35:11.856 --> 35:13.289
No one will know.

35:13.291 --> 35:15.625
I'll know.

35:15.627 --> 35:19.495
And that's the best thing
about it.

35:21.215 --> 35:24.550
For once, let's not
make this a game.

35:31.476 --> 35:33.309
I want to make you an
offer, and I'd like you

35:33.311 --> 35:34.977
to take it seriously.
Okay.

35:34.979 --> 35:36.646
Turn around and go back
into your office

35:36.648 --> 35:38.564
and let me handle
the press conference.

35:38.566 --> 35:40.650
Look, I know this
is tough on you.

35:40.652 --> 35:42.868
Let me take some
of the weight off.

35:45.156 --> 35:46.872
I'll take that as a no.

35:46.874 --> 35:49.041
But thank you, Garrett.
All right, then.

35:49.043 --> 35:51.994
The key phrases are:
“in cooperation with”"

35:51.996 --> 35:54.780
“joint effort,” and
“the good guys won”"

35:54.782 --> 35:57.500
No, the good guys did not win,

35:57.502 --> 35:59.919
and I'm not gonna try
and put lipstick on it.

35:59.921 --> 36:03.339
It is what it is.
We did not close Zoran Brasha.

36:04.559 --> 36:08.144
“In cooperation with”"
“joint effort”"

36:08.146 --> 36:09.679
and “the good guys won”"

36:09.681 --> 36:10.681
(door opens)

36:10.682 --> 36:12.148
(reporters murmuring)

36:12.150 --> 36:13.349
Morning.

36:13.351 --> 36:15.568
ALL:
Morning.

36:18.022 --> 36:21.607
Zoran Brasha was arrested
without incident

36:21.609 --> 36:23.859
this morning by Interpol agents

36:23.861 --> 36:27.229
at the Tivat
International Airport

36:27.231 --> 36:29.031
in Montenegro.

36:29.033 --> 36:32.918
He will be extradited to Serbia,

36:32.920 --> 36:36.372
where he will stand trial
on racketeering charges.

36:36.374 --> 36:37.673
Questions.

36:37.675 --> 36:38.874
Commissioner!
(reporters clamoring)

36:38.876 --> 36:40.593
Helen.
Thank you.

36:40.595 --> 36:42.928
Commissioner, how was
Mr. Brasha able to avoid

36:42.930 --> 36:44.880
prosecution in New York again?

36:44.882 --> 36:47.049
Do you feel
your department failed?

36:48.886 --> 36:52.104
Well, obviously, it's not
the outcome we wanted,

36:52.106 --> 36:55.941
but Zoran Brasha has managed
to avoid prosecution everywhere

36:55.943 --> 36:59.028
until now, and it was
our intelligence

36:59.030 --> 37:01.697
that helped lead to his capture.

37:01.699 --> 37:04.367
Commissioner!
(reporters clamor)

37:04.369 --> 37:06.986
And I think...

37:06.988 --> 37:09.555
what's important
to John Coogan--

37:09.557 --> 37:13.325
and his other victims

37:13.327 --> 37:14.910
and their families--

37:14.912 --> 37:18.497
is that Zoran Brasha
is now behind bars

37:18.499 --> 37:25.054
where he and his organization
can no longer prey on anyone.

37:25.056 --> 37:27.006
And...

37:28.593 --> 37:30.076
Whether those bars are

37:30.078 --> 37:33.729
here or in Eastern Europe

37:33.731 --> 37:37.316
is ultimately immaterial.

37:41.656 --> 37:43.856
The good guys won.

37:45.109 --> 37:46.842
(reporters clamoring)

37:54.118 --> 37:56.035
(knocking)

37:57.338 --> 37:59.538
What's up?

38:03.094 --> 38:04.794
I've made my choice.

38:04.796 --> 38:06.145
I want to go to Columbia.

38:06.147 --> 38:08.547
Okay.

38:08.549 --> 38:10.349
Why?

38:10.351 --> 38:12.051
It's a great school.

38:12.053 --> 38:14.970
It's my mom's Alma mater.

38:14.972 --> 38:16.972
And my friend Melissa
got in, too,

38:16.974 --> 38:18.974
and her family has
an apartment right off campus,

38:18.976 --> 38:21.360
so she says I can
live with her, and that way

38:21.362 --> 38:23.028
you won't have to worry
about paying for

38:23.030 --> 38:26.232
housing or a meal plan
or anything.

38:26.234 --> 38:28.868
Well, you're talking
pretty fast there, kiddo.

38:28.870 --> 38:31.153
Something else
driving your decision?

38:31.155 --> 38:33.322
No.

38:33.324 --> 38:34.824
Just feels right.

38:34.826 --> 38:37.827
Well, I want you
to broaden your horizons--

38:37.829 --> 38:39.829
including geographically--

38:39.831 --> 38:42.548
and we discussed this,
we agreed on this.

38:42.550 --> 38:45.184
You went to school
in New York, and you did great.

38:45.186 --> 38:47.503
Uh-huh.

38:47.505 --> 38:48.721
Honest answer?

38:48.723 --> 38:49.922
Mm-hmm.

38:49.924 --> 38:51.407
You didn't happen to overhear

38:51.409 --> 38:53.943
Grandpa and I talking
the other night after dinner?

38:53.945 --> 38:55.511
No. Why?

38:55.513 --> 38:57.346
The money-saving angle
to your decision.

38:57.348 --> 38:58.747
Mom,

38:58.749 --> 39:01.467
I can look up what these schools
cost and what you make in, like,

39:01.469 --> 39:03.803
two Google seconds.

39:03.805 --> 39:06.222
I'm just trying to help.

39:06.224 --> 39:08.741
Well, I appreciate that.

39:10.912 --> 39:13.078
But no decision
needs to be made tonight,

39:13.080 --> 39:15.214
so why don't we both
sleep on it?

39:18.452 --> 39:20.503
Love you.

39:20.505 --> 39:22.671
I love you, too.

39:33.968 --> 39:36.218
DANNY:
All right, one more thing.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.720
JAMIE:
That's five more things already.

39:37.722 --> 39:40.890
Listen, use your opponent's
momentum against him, all right?

39:40.892 --> 39:43.392
If he comes forward,
don't go back, slip to the side.

39:43.394 --> 39:45.144
Yeah, Rico drilled me
on that, too. I'm ready.

39:45.146 --> 39:46.612
All right, now
I'll shut up.

39:46.614 --> 39:49.532
Tonight, you got one job:
make your family proud.

39:51.235 --> 39:53.319
Rico.

39:53.321 --> 39:54.904
Yeah, it's your
trainer. So what?

39:57.742 --> 39:58.908
Hey, Rico.

39:58.910 --> 40:01.076
Oh, hey, hey, champ.

40:01.078 --> 40:02.745
Dude, you ready to fight?

40:02.747 --> 40:04.463
Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah?

40:04.465 --> 40:06.215
Yeah, I'm ready,
but so are you.

40:06.217 --> 40:08.384
Uh, what-what are you
talking about?

40:08.386 --> 40:10.419
That's a late '70s Triumph
you just rode in on, right?

40:10.421 --> 40:12.504
So?

40:12.506 --> 40:14.006
So shifting that thing's like

40:14.008 --> 40:15.507
lifting a refrigerator
with your right foot.

40:15.509 --> 40:18.177
You're all healed up.
Since when?

40:18.179 --> 40:21.597
It just healed, like, you know,
quicker than I thought.

40:21.599 --> 40:24.266
Yeah, so why'd you keep
training me, then?

40:24.268 --> 40:26.518
Reagans got a
legacy in this event

40:26.520 --> 40:28.103
that goes back years, right?
Yeah.

40:28.105 --> 40:30.155
I didn't want
to be that guy,

40:30.157 --> 40:33.359
you know, that-that breaks it up
when it gets another chance.

40:33.361 --> 40:35.277
No, man. Come on.

40:35.279 --> 40:36.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

40:36.614 --> 40:38.063
Look, you're ready to fight.

40:38.065 --> 40:40.115
Yeah, but so's he. This is
supposed to be his night, Danny.

40:40.117 --> 40:41.784
He got picked for it
months ago,

40:41.786 --> 40:43.953
he trained for it,
he counted on it.

40:43.955 --> 40:45.504
Yeah, and then he hurt his ankle
and he couldn't fight.

40:45.506 --> 40:47.172
Yeah, but now he can.

40:48.292 --> 40:50.292
And Reagans got another legacy
goes back a lot longer

40:50.294 --> 40:53.379
than this fight, which is
giving each man his due.

40:54.215 --> 40:56.215
So are you ready to box?

40:57.551 --> 40:59.852
Uh... I guess.

40:59.854 --> 41:02.805
Yeah? Well, you ready to fight?

41:02.807 --> 41:03.939
Hell, yeah.

41:03.941 --> 41:06.809
Yeah?
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

41:06.811 --> 41:08.477
All right, then, listen,
go suit up, all right?

41:08.479 --> 41:10.479
Me and my brother are gonna
work your corner, right, Danny?

41:10.481 --> 41:11.563
For real?

41:12.900 --> 41:15.150
Hey, you know,
we're the fighting finest.

41:15.152 --> 41:18.537
See that? I'm gonna take it off,
and I'm gonna win this.

41:18.539 --> 41:20.823
All right? (whoops)

41:20.825 --> 41:22.992
Yeah! Yeah.

41:26.831 --> 41:28.998
Make our family proud?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.165
Yeah.

41:30.167 --> 41:32.251
You made the family proud,
all right.

41:32.253 --> 41:34.803
The bleeding heart,
pay it forward,

41:34.805 --> 41:36.505
peace, love and happiness
side of the family--

41:36.507 --> 41:37.840
they're real proud of you.

41:37.842 --> 41:39.008
Oh, so not your side.

41:39.010 --> 41:41.260
Well, my side
makes your side possible.

41:41.262 --> 41:42.728
(laughs):
You're such a jerk.

41:42.730 --> 41:43.846
You did good, kid.

41:43.848 --> 41:46.181
Come on. Let's go
help him win this.
