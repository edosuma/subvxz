WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:04.254
Previously on 90210...

00:04.296 --> 00:07.424
Don't ever
do that again.

00:07.466 --> 00:08.383
Admit you felt something.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.803
I felt something...
but now I don't.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.304
Just so
you know,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.430
you can't un-feel something.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.098
DIXON:
Close to walking

00:15.140 --> 00:16.684
isn't really walking, is it?

00:16.725 --> 00:17.852
Dixon, the only person
that's keeping you

00:17.893 --> 00:19.979
in this chair
right now is you.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.647
This contract links you
and Vanessa for three years.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.940
You either have to
wait out the terms

00:22.982 --> 00:24.316
or hope she gets
hit by a bus.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.610
Your fiancée and business
partner doesn't even exist.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.487
I'd be surprised if any of us
saw her again.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.864
SILVER:
I decided to have a baby

00:29.905 --> 00:31.657
before the BRCA gene surgeries.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.993
First the pregnancy,
then the surgeries--

00:34.034 --> 00:35.577
your entire body's
about to change.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.954
Most people don't use

00:36.996 --> 00:38.831
these pregnancy gift cards
till they're showing.

00:38.873 --> 00:39.790
I know,

00:39.832 --> 00:40.833
but I kind of want

00:40.875 --> 00:42.167
to remember my body like this.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.044
NAOMI:
Alec kissed me!
My relationship with Max is

00:45.086 --> 00:46.213
the most important thing
in the world to me.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.339
My marriage to
Max is the most

00:47.381 --> 00:48.423
important thing in
the world to me.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.925
If I don't tell him,

00:49.967 --> 00:51.719
he'll never be able
to trust me.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.764
Just give me time to do it
in the right way.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.019
NAOMI:
Well, eat up, girls.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.397
Max gets back from his
business trip in two hours,

01:03.438 --> 01:06.483
and I still have to get
a pedicure and a Brazilian.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.695
Uh, have you told Max
about Alec kissing you,

01:09.737 --> 01:11.030
or is that the reason
for the Brazilian?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.990
Well, that's not something
you just blurt out.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.366
It's all about timing.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.450
Which is why,

01:15.492 --> 01:16.994
as soon as Max gets home,

01:17.036 --> 01:19.454
I am whisking him away for
the perfect romantic weekend.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.832
That way, when I tell
him about the kiss,

01:21.874 --> 01:24.083
he'll say, "Who cares, baby?
Look how happy we are."

01:24.125 --> 01:26.127
(laughs) Oh,
speaking of which.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.006
Annie, can you babysit
the mansion while I'm
gone for the weekend?

01:29.048 --> 01:30.507
Well, Dixon's
out of his wheelchair

01:30.549 --> 01:32.091
and told me
to stop babysitting him,

01:32.133 --> 01:33.802
so I am completely
free, yeah.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.512
So, Dixon's
feeling better?

01:35.554 --> 01:36.889
Yep. That's why we're
gonna start focusing

01:36.931 --> 01:38.139
on our careers again.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.683
I'm working on
a new song and a video,

01:39.725 --> 01:41.018
and he's working
with this

01:41.060 --> 01:42.477
huge promoter
for a comeback performance.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.813
(gasps) Hey!
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.941
It's just, I recognized
you by your neck tattoo.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.316
Your pictures
are incredible.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.526
Here.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.986
Uh... more bread?

01:51.028 --> 01:51.987
Yeah.
All right.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.948
What the hell was that?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.866
Oh, he probably recognized
you from your nude photos.

01:55.908 --> 01:56.825
ANNIE:
Your what?

01:56.867 --> 01:57.952
You took nude photos?

01:57.993 --> 01:59.787
And you didn't tell us?
I didn't tell you,

01:59.828 --> 02:01.162
because they were
supposed to be private.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.414
How do you know
about them?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.416
More importantly,
how does he know about them?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.668
Well, I can't speak
for the entire service industry,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.461
but the photographer called me
and thanked me

02:08.502 --> 02:09.922
for buying the shoot as a gift.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.757
She put the pictures up
on her Web site.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.342
She put my pictures online?!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.177
Mm. Don't worry, honey.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.513
They were gorgeous.
Very tasteful.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.390
I'm actually thinking of
getting a set done myself

02:20.432 --> 02:21.725
just to put up around the house.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.769
ADRIANNA:
Oh, my God, here they are.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.979
(gasping)

02:25.020 --> 02:27.564
Look at this.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.024
Oh, you look hot!

02:29.066 --> 02:30.943
WAITER:
From the gentleman.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.903
(Naomi growls sexily)

02:32.945 --> 02:35.196
He's gorgeous.
Apparently,

02:35.238 --> 02:37.282
the busboy's not
your only fan, honey.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.617
"To four beautiful ladies,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.285
from a guy who hates
to drink alone."

02:40.327 --> 02:42.537
Mm.
(laughs) I think
that's for all of us.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.706
Annie, go talk to him.
But... why me?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.041
Because I am married,
and Adrianna

02:46.083 --> 02:48.251
has Dixon, and Silver's
trying to get pregnant.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.336
It kind of

02:49.377 --> 02:50.504
knocks you out of the running.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.506
You're right.
My life's a little complicated

02:52.547 --> 02:53.799
for most guys right now--

02:53.841 --> 02:56.301
not to mention I am butt-naked
on the Internet.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.387
And meanwhile, Annie
is so, so alone.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.556
Now, are you going to walk
over there like a big girl,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.266
or am I going to have
to make a scene?

03:03.308 --> 03:05.310
No, no, no.
I will go

03:05.352 --> 03:07.646
and have a drink with him,
that's it.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.065
Champagne, ladies?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.400
Yeah.
Can we get some
flutes? Yoo-hoo.

Hey.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.867
I have with me the
top secret blueprints

03:19.908 --> 03:21.910

Please.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.454
Okay, it's gonna be sweet.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.790
We're gonna enclose the
patio, put up some walls...

Wait. You taking
a business class?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.422
Wait, isn't your movie
about to start shooting?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.425
Yeah. Just all this craziness
with Vanessa made me realize

03:37.467 --> 03:39.720
I got to take more control
of my life,

03:39.761 --> 03:42.014
so I'm looking into
franchising the Offshore.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.682
Hey, that's brilliant.
Hey, when the club opens,

03:43.724 --> 03:45.142
people are going to be
dying to invest.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.393
We're gonna make tons of cash.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.311
Yeah. Unfortunately, the
banks won't give me a loan

03:48.353 --> 03:51.272
until they see that I've
written up a business plan,
so that's why I'm taking

03:51.314 --> 03:54.860
a class-- so I don't look
like an idiot.
Okay, so let me
show you the deck.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.486
Give me a second. I got
to talk to the teacher.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.613
Hey, Professor Beckwith.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.490
Hey, uh, I just wanted
to say thanks again

04:00.532 --> 04:02.159
for taking a look
at my contract.

I-I need to take more
control of my life,

late in the semester, but
I think I'm all caught up.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.793
Yes, Mr. Court.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.504
I believe I have
your first paper here.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.675
An "F"? Are you serious?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.761
I spent, like, three hours
researching this.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.512
Let me guess-- Wikipedia?

pretending to be a student,

you're not serious
about your education.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.023
That's not fair.
I'm very serious about this.

Nothing exciting.

we haven't been able
to have our honeymoon yet,

important that we have

some quality time together,
just the two of us.

the exact same thing.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.818
posted them online.
How could you do that?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.695
I mean, they're of me
naked-- I wasn't gonna
show them to anyone!

08:07.737 --> 08:10.698
You signed a release saying
that I could use them for
promotional purposes.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.825
I signed what?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.076
It's in my standard paperwork.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.286
All my clients sign it.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.370
(exhales)

08:15.412 --> 08:17.414
I am proud of
these photos.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.957
You should be, too.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.668
Okay, look, I'm...
I think you did a great job.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.838
It's just, there are naked
photos of me on the Internet,

08:24.879 --> 08:27.090
and... I can't
have them popping up

08:27.132 --> 08:29.050
whenever I go in
for job interviews.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.593
I'll take them down right away.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.720
Okay. Thank you.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.474
Sorry if I was...
freaking out.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.933
Unfortunately, I can't guarantee
that they're not gonna pop up

08:37.976 --> 08:39.186
on some other Web site.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.312
Once something

08:40.354 --> 08:41.480
this popular hits the Web,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.523
it's kind of hard
to make it disappear.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.068
♪ ♪

08:48.987 --> 08:53.241
Hey. You going on some
kind of fashion safari?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.327
Max wants to go camping,

08:55.369 --> 08:57.371
and I decided to give
him what he wants.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.746
Trust me, after a
weekend of jungle sex,

08:58.788 --> 09:02.876
he won't bat an eye
when I tell him about Alec.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.504
You look nice.
Did you go on a date

09:05.545 --> 09:07.005
with that guy
from the restaurant?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.757
His name is Colin,
and no, we did not go on a date.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.968
He just moved here,
so I was showing him around.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.594
Mm-hmm.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.055
Okay, fine, he's great.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.848
And he has all
these amazing stories

09:16.890 --> 09:18.517
about traveling
to foreign countries.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.977
Oh, and get this-- he's
a computer geek just like Max.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.937
Oh, my gosh.
Computer geeks are awesome!

09:22.979 --> 09:25.732
You'd be amazed at what other
special talents they possess.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.193
(laughs)
Still, I don't think
I'm gonna see him again.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.944
The thought
of dating someone right now

09:29.986 --> 09:31.821
just totally stresses me out.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.324
ANNIE:
Speaking of stress...

09:34.366 --> 09:36.117
Are you okay?

09:36.159 --> 09:39.329
Well, Katie took my pictures
off her site-- unfortunately,

09:39.371 --> 09:42.916
they're so "popular"
that they're now plastered
all over the Web.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.210
Mm.
Does Max know some way

09:45.252 --> 09:47.379
to, like, scrub them
off the Internet?

09:47.421 --> 09:48.963
He's at work right now.
And frankly,

09:49.005 --> 09:51.425
I want him focusing on me,
not your naked pictures.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.093
Right.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.554
Hey, what are you
doing with my phone?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.223
Hello, Colin.
This is Naomi Clark-Miller,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.141
Annie's best friend
in the whole world.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.435
We're having

10:01.476 --> 10:03.270
a little bit
of a computer crisis,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.522
and Annie was wondering
if you could drop by.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.149
I was not.
That is fantastic.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.026
I'll text you
the address.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.404
Pleasure talking to you, too.
Ta ta.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.073
I can't believe you.
Is Colin the guy
from the restaurant?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.117
Yes, and he's the perfect
person to help you

10:17.158 --> 10:18.618
with your problem.
Meanwhile, Annie

10:18.659 --> 10:19.911
gets to hang out
with him

10:19.953 --> 10:22.414
without the pressure
of another actual date.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.623
Win-win.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.459
(departing footsteps)

10:27.294 --> 10:31.005
DIXON:
Dude...

10:31.047 --> 10:33.758
28 steps up
from the parking lot.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.136
I never bothered to count
before, but damn.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.513
Hey, why didn't you call me?
I could've met you down there.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.639
Hey, have a seat.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.349
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.017
I just wanted to see
how this place

10:43.059 --> 10:44.603
was shaping up.
Yeah.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.438
It looks good, man.
Thanks.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.523
Yeah, I've been killing
myself with this opening.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.151
Still can't decide whether
I'm doing trance or techno.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Taylor didn't tell you?

10:52.693 --> 10:54.154
No.
It's all covered, man.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.281
I'm your opening act.
(laughs)

10:56.323 --> 10:57.949
Wait, what?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talked
about it all day yesterday.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.119
I mean, it's cool with you,
right?

11:01.161 --> 11:04.038
No, no, I just, uh, I wasn't
sure if you were up for it.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.124
I mean, you can barely make it
up the steps.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.585
Dude, I'm not performing
on a treadmill.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.171
Look, don't worry. I'm fine,
okay? Besides, I wanted to

11:11.212 --> 11:12.797
talk to you about
equipment and a playlist.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.341
See what you like,
you know?
Yeah.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.301
Hey, Navid, did you move the
stuff out of my storage room?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.885
Max and Naomi are going
camping this weekend

11:17.927 --> 11:19.471
and they want to
borrow a sleeping bag.
No.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.015
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Naomi's going camping?

11:22.056 --> 11:24.683
(laughs)
Okay, this is something
I got to see.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.727
Man, camping sounds
fantastic right now.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.563
I would kill for some time away.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.149
Time away from what?
You're a movie star.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.318
Uh, how about my co-star
is texting me every 15 minutes.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.236
I literally
can't get away from her.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.864
Like, her standing
in your doorway half-naked?

11:37.905 --> 11:41.117
Liam, I have been waiting
forever for you to get home.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.494
What the hell are you
doing here?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.538
I thought we could let
the paparazzi "catch" us

11:44.579 --> 11:45.664
hanging out together.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.041
You know, give them
something to write about.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.418
Like how we spent the day
sunbathing topless.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.885
Dude, I would kill to have your
life for, like, five minutes.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.720
Okay, that's it.
I'm going camping.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.023
Isn't this amazing?
Who knew the wilderness
could be so...

12:12.065 --> 12:13.858
(swats a bug)
wild.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.235
Hey.
Hi.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.405
You know, honestly,
I was a little surprised

12:18.446 --> 12:19.531
you were okay with this.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.781
Oh, you know me.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.326
I'm up for anything
that brings us closer.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.286
Oh.
Ooh. Watch your step.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.497
I think the campsite's
up around the corner.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.790
All right.
Okay.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.627
NAOMI:
Ta-da!

12:32.669 --> 12:34.295
MAN:
Your bag, ma'am?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.381
NAOMI:
Can you believe
I found this place?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.925
MAN:
May I help you, sir?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.843
This is gonna be
so much better

12:40.885 --> 12:42.095
than sleeping in the dirt.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.472
We have...
MAN:
This way.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.808
...a masseuse,
a personal chef,

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
a full time waitstaff.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.605
Which means...

12:51.646 --> 12:53.772
we get to spend

12:53.814 --> 12:55.734
the entire weekend...

12:55.774 --> 12:57.818
enjoying each
other's company.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.196
Yeah, it's just, uh...

13:00.238 --> 13:01.780
It's very different

13:01.822 --> 13:03.491
from what I expected.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.825
NAOMI:
Baby...

13:04.867 --> 13:07.537
we are going to have the
most romantic weekend ever,

13:07.579 --> 13:09.163
I promise.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.919
All right, so I'm setting up
a computer program to crawl

13:14.961 --> 13:16.254
the Web and remove any trace

13:16.296 --> 13:18.339
of your photos.
It's kind of like a virus,

13:18.381 --> 13:19.798
but for good instead of evil.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.342
Thanks so much, Colin.
You're a lifesaver.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.510
Yeah, thank you.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.095
This is way more interesting
than the programming

13:24.137 --> 13:26.097
I usually do.
It's very James Bond.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.265
If we get attacked
by double agents,

13:27.307 --> 13:28.767
I'm expecting you girls
to protect me.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.644
If that's what it takes to
get my pictures off the Web,

13:30.685 --> 13:32.103
I will seriously
kick some ass.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.480
Hey, look at the bright side.
Look at some

13:33.521 --> 13:35.356
of these comments...
"Gorgeous body."

13:35.398 --> 13:37.692
"This is the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen."

13:37.734 --> 13:40.278
Not to mention how many people
retweeted your photos.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.280
Really? How many?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.365
Uh, I'd say around
20,000 hits.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.200
Oh.
You're borderline viral.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.577
ANNIE:
Okay,

13:47.619 --> 13:49.120
it does not suck
to be called beautiful.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.622
Yeah, I guess.
COLIN:
Look, everyone

13:50.664 --> 13:52.415
has an online presence
these days-- it's like

13:52.457 --> 13:54.459
your past is an open book. You
meet someone, you Google them.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.252
That's how I found out
about you and that priest.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.505
What?
Yeah, you guys did some

13:58.546 --> 14:00.340
kind of charity together?
Sounds fantastic.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.926
(sighs)
That, yeah,
that, uh, was great.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.595
It was great.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.265
Well, looks like
my job here is done.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.393
I also fix plumbing, repair
roofs, and change tires.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.270
If you guys have any more
problems, just, uh,

14:14.312 --> 14:15.563
give me a call.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.649
Thank you so much.
No, it was a pleasure,
meeting you.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.526
You, too.
And, uh, Annie,

14:19.567 --> 14:21.361
thank you so much for showing me
around town yesterday.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.445
I'd love to repay

14:22.487 --> 14:24.905
the favor by
taking you to dinner.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.074
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.160
I'm actually seeing somebody.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.286
It's kind of new,
which is probably why

14:30.328 --> 14:31.954
it's not online yet.
Of course.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.499
I should've known.
You're too pretty to be single.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.378
Well, if anything changes,
you have my number.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.883
Why did you lie
to that amazing looking man?

14:43.924 --> 14:46.386
I don't want to
talk about it.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.722
Um, hey, has Taylor
stopped by?

14:48.763 --> 14:50.640
He said he wanted
to go over a few things

14:50.682 --> 14:51.932
for my music video.

14:51.974 --> 14:52.975
Backyard.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.269
Cool. Thanks.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.067
Uh, okay,
why are there stripper poles?

15:01.108 --> 15:03.403
They are for
your new music video.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.613
Thanks.
ADRIANNA:
Are you kidding me?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.866
I know exactly
what you're doing.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.617
I told you I slept with you
in Vegas

15:09.659 --> 15:11.578
because I though Dixon
and I weren't together.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.662
It's not gonna
happen again.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.664
No matter how hard you try
to worm your way

15:14.706 --> 15:16.583
back into my life
and seduce me.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.834
I'm not trying to seduce you.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.461
I want you to seduce me.
Professionally, I mean.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.129
What are you talking about?
It's my job

15:22.171 --> 15:23.381
to sell you to the public.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.965
If you want to further
your career,

15:25.007 --> 15:26.092
you have to sex up your image.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.011
So this is about work?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.555
Yeah.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.890
I have a pole
dancing instructor

15:31.931 --> 15:33.349
coming to whip you into shape.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.934
Now trust me,
I have no problem

15:34.975 --> 15:36.936
keeping our relationship
professional, do you?

15:36.977 --> 15:38.145
Of course not.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
I can totally keep
this professional.
Great.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.316
Great.
I'll be back for
a dress rehearsal

15:42.358 --> 15:44.652
and then we'll see
where we stand.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.531
Oh, and by the way,
if I wanted to seduce you,

15:48.573 --> 15:52.118
you would've been naked
in that pool five minutes ago.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.919
Can't believe you made it
on this trip.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.295
Sure you're not
pushing yourself too hard?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.337
Yeah.
I got it.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.422
No, I'm good.
No...

16:04.464 --> 16:05.799
Dude.
Let go. I got it.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.093
This is exactly why I came.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.887
I'm tired of this
whole accident

16:10.929 --> 16:13.180
holding me back,
you know?
Yeah.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.557
Besides, we can
use this weekend

16:14.599 --> 16:17.226
to talk about how we gonna
shut the club down.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.645
(laughs)
Yeah.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.315
Oh, finally...

16:22.356 --> 16:23.983
some peace and quiet.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.903
I'll figure out what to do
about the class I'm taking.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.697
You know, my life is incredibly
complicated right now.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.199
You'd think the teacher
would just cut me some slack.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.160
Yeah, dude, you are doing
as much as you can, right?

16:34.201 --> 16:35.995
She should just
help a brother out.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.580
Exactly.
NAVID:
Or on the other hand,

16:37.622 --> 16:38.832
she can't give you special
treatment just because

16:38.873 --> 16:40.124
you're a celebrity.
I mean,

16:40.166 --> 16:41.918
that would be unfair
to the real students.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.711
No, I meant "other."

16:43.753 --> 16:45.379
Other students.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.798
I'm just saying
special treatment

16:46.840 --> 16:48.048
causes a lot of problems.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.427
Well, he has a point.
(Liam sighs)

16:53.763 --> 16:57.558
Okay, apparently all we have
is six cans of chili.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.393
Anybody got a pot?

16:59.435 --> 17:00.603
Or a can opener?
Wait.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.729
You said you're
bringing everything.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.940
No worries.
I'll just call my, uh,

17:03.982 --> 17:05.858
agent's assistant to run us up
a few things.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.401
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.819
What? You're calling your agent
for a delivery?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.029
What?
So that's what you meant

17:10.069 --> 17:11.990
by roughing it.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.200
I actually think I
like this new Liam.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.202
It used to be he wouldn't
take help from anyone.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.411
Now he's all, uh,

17:17.453 --> 17:20.039
I have to call my people
to have 'em deliver

17:20.079 --> 17:21.875
some slippers
and a pizza.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.291
I get it. I get it.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.169
Apparently no one takes me
seriously anymore.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.547
You know what? That's fine.
I don't need to call for help.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.216
I'll just open these cans
with a knife.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
Or a rock.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.138
Hey...

17:36.180 --> 17:38.098
you two fine outdoorsman
want to set up the tent

17:38.140 --> 17:39.809
while I look for firewood?

17:43.396 --> 17:46.065
Let's go.
No, I got this.
No, no, no.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.443
Mmm. Isn't this fantastic?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.278
Just the two of us

17:51.320 --> 17:54.365
enjoying each other's company.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.075
Are you sure

17:56.116 --> 17:58.452
you don't want
a massage, honey?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.664
There's just something about
lying naked next to my wife

18:01.706 --> 18:04.667
while two strangers touch us
that kind of creeps me out.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.712
Maybe you'd like the
hot mud bath better.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.338
Or we could do
a wine tasting.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.590
Deeper, please.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.967
Hey, uh, did you know
this place has a ropes course?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.719
Max...

18:14.761 --> 18:16.930
if you want to get kinky
with some ropes, I'm all in.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.348
No, it's a, it's like
an obstacle course

18:19.390 --> 18:22.101
with rope ladders
and bridges, and...

18:22.142 --> 18:25.897
It says, "promotes cooperation,
team work and trust."

18:25.939 --> 18:26.940
Hmm.

18:26.981 --> 18:27.941
That sound fun?

18:27.982 --> 18:30.359
Not as fun as what
I was suggesting.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.403
But fine.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.114
If that's what it takes to give
you the perfect weekend then...

18:35.155 --> 18:36.991
we'll do a ropes course.
All right.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.284
Thank you.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.748
Hey, guys,
sorry it took me so long.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.709
I had to go all the way
to the creek bed to find...

18:48.377 --> 18:49.963
Navid?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.634
Dixon?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.428
So, yeah, man, I was like,
this isn't background music.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.722
Dixon Wilson is back.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.891
Sorry.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.893
Yeah, let's definitely
spend the money

19:03.935 --> 19:05.394
on the speakers.
Like, I want to

19:05.436 --> 19:07.897
shake the whole place
down to the ground, you know?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.566
(grunts)

19:10.608 --> 19:12.777
My bad.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.654
Hey, I can handle this.
Oh, no, it's cool.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.405
I got...
I got this.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.574
Dawg, I'm fine. Relax.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.284
Dude, you're not fine, okay?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.535
You're getting better,

19:21.577 --> 19:22.870
but you're not 100%.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.288
Dude, you can't even
put up a tent.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.748
Which means you're not ready.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.417
You're not ready
to open my club.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.669
I'm not r...

19:29.710 --> 19:32.797
I'm a DJ, I'm not trying
to earn a merit badge.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.548
Do you have any idea how much
I have riding on this?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.009
I've got one shot
to make a name

19:36.050 --> 19:38.136
for myself and I have
to knock it out of the park.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.097
A guy in a leg brace does not
scream kick-ass opening act.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.057
So that's it? I'm out?

19:43.099 --> 19:44.558
Look, I'm sorry.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.894
I'm sorry it has to be this way,
but maybe in a couple months...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.980
Maybe in a couple months?

19:49.022 --> 19:49.939
You know what?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.565
Maybe since I'm so disabled,

19:51.607 --> 19:53.109
I should just go home, huh?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.276
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.778
I'm not saying
that you have to leave...

19:55.820 --> 19:58.072
Think I want to walk
in these stupid things?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.239
Huh?

19:59.281 --> 20:02.493
Have my whole life
turned upside down?

20:02.535 --> 20:03.661
You know what, man?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.998
I thought you were my friend.
My bad.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.292
Dixon...

20:10.334 --> 20:12.170
what are you doing?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.212
(engine starts)

20:13.253 --> 20:15.089
Dixon, if you take the car,

20:15.131 --> 20:16.966
how are Liam and I supposed
to get home?

20:17.008 --> 20:19.719
Well, uh, unlike me,
you guys can walk.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.304
Dixon, get out the car.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.263
Enjoy the woods.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.849
Dixon, hey, hey.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.601
Stop playing, man.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.562
Dixon, hey!

20:34.859 --> 20:38.696
Come on, come on, come on,
work, work, work, work, work.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.822
Oh, come on, come on.

20:39.864 --> 20:40.948
(phone rings)

20:41.908 --> 20:43.868
Hello, hello.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.911
Liam, it's Carrie.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.286
I have been looking
all over for you.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.371
There's this huge party
up on Melrose...

20:47.413 --> 20:49.415
Yeah, yeah, Liam's not here.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.917
Where is he?
(over phone): Uh, I don't know.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.459
Look, I have been trying
for the past half hour

20:52.501 --> 20:53.753
to get cell phone reception.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.171
We were camping
near Bodhi Mountain Resort,

20:55.213 --> 20:56.172
and our so-called friend

20:56.214 --> 20:58.216
stole our car, and, and I had...

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
(phone beeping)
Hello?

20:59.299 --> 21:01.719
Hello? What?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.638
(sighs)

21:06.099 --> 21:08.308
Is that Naomi's glamp-site?

21:08.350 --> 21:10.436
Oh, thank God.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.438
(laughs)

21:12.479 --> 21:15.024
(sighs)

21:17.026 --> 21:18.861
♪ ♪

21:18.903 --> 21:19.862
NAOMI:
Holy crap.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.240
Oh, don't worry,
you'll be fine.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.117
The ropes course is
a piece of cake.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.451
The rope course?

21:25.492 --> 21:26.827
You're Ryan Lochte.

21:26.869 --> 21:30.039
You're standing in front of me,
shimmering like a gold medal.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.125
And that's scary, yeah.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.752
Yeah, seriously, I would
love to race Phelps on that.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.669
(laughter)

21:35.711 --> 21:36.837
Let's go, babe.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.380
I thought your mom said
you didn't have time

21:38.422 --> 21:41.467
for a girlfriend.
I don't, but does
she look unhappy?

21:41.508 --> 21:42.927
I'm so happy.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.428
(both laugh)

21:44.470 --> 21:45.471
Okay, Naomi.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.472
I love you.
Yeah,

21:46.513 --> 21:47.681
he's a god,
all right,

21:47.723 --> 21:50.309
so let's quit stalling
and let's do this.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.228
(groans)

21:52.270 --> 21:55.397
FYI, wearing a blindfold
does not inspire

21:55.439 --> 21:57.524
trust or
confidence.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.901
Just follow my voice.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.194
Come on.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.237
Stick your foot out,
come on.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.114
(groans)
You got it.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.573
It's r-- put...

22:04.615 --> 22:06.951
Oh.
There you are, there you are,
there you are.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.744
One foot in front
of the other.
Okay, okay.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.037
Yeah, uh-huh.

22:10.079 --> 22:10.997
You see?

22:11.038 --> 22:11.998
Okay.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.415
We can get through
anything together.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.374
Uh-huh.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.584
You got it,
there you go.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.710
Oh, okay, oh, oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.670
Naomi, don't grab that.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.130
You're gonna throw us
off balance.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.339
In case you haven't
noticed, I am

22:20.380 --> 22:21.841
a little off
balance already.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.343
No, no, no, honey,
you have to let...
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

22:24.384 --> 22:27.054
(both screaming)

22:30.057 --> 22:31.934
That sucked!

22:31.976 --> 22:33.311
Honey, it wouldn't
have happened

22:33.351 --> 22:34.436
if you'd just
trusted me.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.813
No, it wouldn't
have happened

22:35.855 --> 22:38.774
if you hadn't had us do
this stupid rope course!

22:38.816 --> 22:40.901
I wanted to have
a calm, happy,

22:40.943 --> 22:42.611
perfect, relaxed weekend

22:42.653 --> 22:46.240
so that we could get closer as
a couple, not play boot camp.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.620
(sighs)

22:51.662 --> 22:54.040
Thanks.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.501
You're seriously
going to do this?

22:57.543 --> 23:00.420
Yeah, it's for work
and I'm professional.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.380
I'm gonna dance the hell
out of that pole.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.842
You mean like this?

23:04.884 --> 23:08.554
Oh, yeah, baby,
like it like this.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.806
No.
WOMAN:
Just so we're clear,

23:10.848 --> 23:13.726
that's not even close
to what we're doing.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.311
(laughs)
Sorry.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.938
They're subbing
as my backup dancers.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.773
Pole dancing doesn't have
to be sleazy.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.317
You know, people use it
for exercise

23:21.359 --> 23:22.235
or to build self-esteem.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.361
SILVER:
How does one

23:23.401 --> 23:26.864
build self-esteem
pole dancing exactly?

23:26.906 --> 23:27.948
Do you want to feel sexy?

23:27.990 --> 23:29.909
Try dancing in front
of a live audience.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.161
Trust me, there is
nothing like it.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.662
You girls ready
to get going?

23:33.704 --> 23:35.706
20,000 people
have already seen me naked.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.041
Why the hell not?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.792
Ha.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.127
Come on, Annie,

23:40.169 --> 23:41.461
don't you want to learn
some new moves

23:41.503 --> 23:43.130
for your pretend boyfriend?

23:43.172 --> 23:44.382
Wait, you have
a pretend boyfriend?

23:44.422 --> 23:46.967
Well, the cute guy from
the restaurant asked me out,

23:47.009 --> 23:49.262
and so I said
I was in a relationship.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.596
Okay, well,
that's not going to stop him

23:50.637 --> 23:52.514
'cause guys don't care
if you're in a relationship.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.557
To them it's just
this big game,

23:53.599 --> 23:55.559
and that's why it's up to us

23:55.601 --> 23:57.144
to show them who's in control.

23:57.186 --> 24:00.064
ANNIE:
W-Whoa,

24:00.106 --> 24:02.149
where did that come from?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.318
No idea.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.987
(all laugh)

24:07.029 --> 24:09.407
MAN (over TV):
Forecast-- plenty of sunshine
through today with...

24:09.447 --> 24:12.659
Navid, what are
you doing here?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.494
Short version?

24:14.536 --> 24:17.081
Liam took us camping,
then disappeared into the woods,

24:17.123 --> 24:19.583
and Dixon took off
with our car.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.626
How's your day going?

24:20.667 --> 24:22.878
(chuckles)
Not great.

24:22.920 --> 24:23.921
(sighs)

24:23.963 --> 24:25.923
Has Max been here?
Haven't seen him.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.050
Oh, I-I left Liam a note
so he can meet me here,

24:28.092 --> 24:29.760
we can take a cab
back into town.

24:29.802 --> 24:33.055
He should be here any minute so
we don't... ruin your weekend.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.556
Trust me, it's already ruined.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.474
I have to tell Max
something horrible,

24:36.516 --> 24:38.060
and I tried to create
the perfect moment

24:38.102 --> 24:39.812
so that he doesn't get
angry at me,

24:39.853 --> 24:41.563
but instead
I just made it so much worse.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.191
Yeah, there's no perfect time
to give bad news.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.735
Today I had to tell Dixon
that he couldn't open my club,

24:46.777 --> 24:48.779
and, and maybe
I could have been nicer,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.906
but it still would have ruined
our weekend.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.074
I know people say

24:52.116 --> 24:54.534
honesty is the best policy,
but most of the time

24:54.576 --> 24:56.912
you just end up wishing
you kept your mouth shut.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.499
Like now.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.377
And I was
just named...

25:03.419 --> 25:04.337
Is that my tent?

25:04.378 --> 25:05.754
Yes.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.756
I cannot believe

25:07.798 --> 25:10.259
that Liam Court, my costar

25:10.301 --> 25:11.718
from Corporate Invaders 2,

25:11.760 --> 25:14.930
is lost in the woods,
which is why I am here

25:14.972 --> 25:18.767
to oversee every stage
of the rescue effort.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.774
I can get a copy of that
for my reel, right?

25:25.816 --> 25:26.984
Thank you.
Excuse me.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.986
(chuckling):
Uh, what are you doing here?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.238
I am so glad Liam finally
jumped on the publicity train.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.281
Where is he,
at a bar somewhere?

25:32.323 --> 25:34.033
No, Liam is not at
a bar and he's not

25:34.074 --> 25:35.034
lost in the
woods, okay?

25:35.075 --> 25:36.785
H-He went to
get firewood.

25:36.827 --> 25:37.786
How long ago was that?

25:37.828 --> 25:39.830
I don't know, like,
three hours ago?

25:41.832 --> 25:43.750
Oh, my God, he
probably is lost.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.877
Why are actors
so freaking flaky?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.462
Where did you
last see him?
At our campsite

25:46.504 --> 25:48.881
a couple miles down the road.
Where are you going?

25:48.922 --> 25:50.508
I'm going to find
your stupid little boyfriend

25:50.548 --> 25:52.259
before he gets eaten
by a bear.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.178
Good idea.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.558
TAYLOR:
You made it.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.602
Ready for dress rehearsal?

26:02.644 --> 26:05.772
I can't wait to get
your professional opinion.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.650
Oh, hey, do you mind
sitting in the chair

26:08.692 --> 26:10.194
so that I can mark
my performance?

26:10.236 --> 26:12.154
Okay, I believe
the story is,

26:12.196 --> 26:15.032
I meet a stranger in a bar,

26:15.074 --> 26:18.244
he comes back
to my place,

26:18.285 --> 26:23.374
I change into something
a little bit more comfortable.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.294
And then I put on some music.

Of course,
I already knew that.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.258
I wanted to prove
you felt the same way.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.348
I have to go.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.022
ANNIE:
So,

28:10.063 --> 28:13.192
we erased your nude photos,
did a little pole dance,

28:13.233 --> 28:14.443
dinner and a movie.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.278
I think we've had
a pretty full day.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.279
Am I missing anything?

28:17.321 --> 28:19.615
Hmm, how about,
why you lied to Colin

28:19.657 --> 28:21.241
about having a boyfriend?

28:21.283 --> 28:22.326
Look,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.786
Colin is great,
but if we started dating,

28:24.828 --> 28:27.998
eventually I would have to
tell him that I dated a priest,

28:28.040 --> 28:29.166
and before that

28:29.208 --> 28:31.168
I was essentially a prostitute.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.961
Who wants to be
with someone like that?

28:33.003 --> 28:34.296
I'm damaged goods.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.506
Are you kidding me?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.299
How's this
for damaged goods?

28:37.341 --> 28:38.467
I took those photos

28:38.509 --> 28:40.760
because I'm about to have
a baby with a gay guy

28:40.802 --> 28:41.845
and then have my breasts
surgically removed.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.096
That's like

28:43.138 --> 28:44.598
a 100% chance no one's gonna

28:44.640 --> 28:45.974
ever find me attractive again.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.893
No, it is not.
Whose online dating profile

28:47.934 --> 28:50.937
would get more hits--
ex-hooker or a single teen mom?

28:50.979 --> 28:52.565
Hmm.
Part of me wishes

28:52.606 --> 28:54.400
I would have left
those nude photos online.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.817
(chuckles)

28:55.859 --> 28:56.902
I mean, you were right,

28:56.943 --> 28:58.654
being called beautiful
didn't totally suck.

28:58.696 --> 29:01.532
Yeah, neither did
being asked out by a cute guy.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.991
So maybe you say yes,

29:03.033 --> 29:03.992
and then

29:04.034 --> 29:06.036
if things go well and he happens

29:06.078 --> 29:08.205
to find out
about your past later,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.540
then hopefully he can deal.

29:09.582 --> 29:13.252
But for now why don't
we just enjoy ourselves?

29:13.293 --> 29:14.753
You're right.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.005
I mean, if I'm too pretty
to be single

29:17.047 --> 29:18.882
and your body is a work of art,

29:18.924 --> 29:21.427
then who are we to tell
people that they're wrong?

29:21.468 --> 29:24.346
(both laughing)

29:24.388 --> 29:26.473
(clacking)

29:28.308 --> 29:31.853
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.272
CARRIE:
Need a hand with that?

29:34.565 --> 29:36.400
What are you doing here?

29:36.442 --> 29:37.859
How did you find me?

29:37.901 --> 29:39.986
I grew up hunting
and fishing in Montana.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.530
I know how
to take care of myself.

29:41.572 --> 29:42.989
But let's go.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.617
I got a flock of reporters
waiting to hear how

29:44.658 --> 29:46.034
I rescued you
from certain death.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.537
I would rather die in the woods.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.457
I came out here to get away from
all your crazy publicity stunts,

29:51.498 --> 29:52.458
and what happens?

29:52.499 --> 29:55.127
I get lost like some
overprivileged jerk.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.004
You know what your problem is?

29:58.046 --> 29:59.590
Your movie career

29:59.632 --> 30:01.675
just fell into your lap.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.344
I have busted my ass
for six years

30:04.386 --> 30:06.346
to get to where I am,
and these publicity stunts

30:06.388 --> 30:09.057
are going to make our movie
more successful

30:09.099 --> 30:10.934
and land us
our next acting jobs.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.894
Unlike you, I don't sit around

30:12.936 --> 30:15.230
expecting life
to hand me things.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.899
Wait.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.569
(sighs)

30:20.611 --> 30:23.447
You're right. I...

30:23.489 --> 30:26.950
practically had to be dragged
into being a model and an actor.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.996
And maybe I got a little lazy.

30:31.037 --> 30:34.082
Started taking things
for granted.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.084
But I didn't used
to be like this.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.170
I-I know how
to get things done.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.174
Just not campfires.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.304
About this publicity thing...

30:47.346 --> 30:49.181
if I... if I play along,

30:49.222 --> 30:51.350
can we just
take it down a notch?

30:51.391 --> 30:53.977
I-I got to have
a little sanity in my life.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.938
Maybe. Depends on how good
your acting is.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.528
(sighs)

31:02.569 --> 31:05.489
(sighs)

31:05.531 --> 31:07.700
It'll look better
for the cameras.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.790
(sighs)

31:14.832 --> 31:16.916
(crickets chirping)

31:21.380 --> 31:23.256
Max.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.342
I've been looking
all over for you.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.260
I wanted to apologize.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.638
I was trying to make
this whole weekend perfect,

31:29.680 --> 31:31.097
and then, I almost ruined it.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.017
Look, I know
that you think

31:34.059 --> 31:36.269
that this ropes
course is silly.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.771
I just

31:37.813 --> 31:39.939
think that it's important
for you

31:39.981 --> 31:42.942
to be able to trust me.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.572
To know that I'm gonna be there
for you, no matter what.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.408
Come on up here.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.410
Ah.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.329
There we go.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.998
Oh. Well, what
are you doing?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.669
I want you to fall
backwards into my arms.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.003
Oh.
(laughs)

32:02.045 --> 32:03.963
From up here? No.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.466
Come on.
No. Are you crazy?!

32:06.508 --> 32:08.510
You don't have to worry.
I'm gonna catch you.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.387
(sighs)
Okay.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.097
Turn around.
It's okay.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.265
Take it easy.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.683
Okay, okay, okay.
This is terrifying.

32:14.725 --> 32:15.934
I know. Honey,

32:15.975 --> 32:18.061
look at me.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.646
Just trust me.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.482
I'm ready
when you're ready.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.692
Okay.

32:23.734 --> 32:24.943
(panting)
Okay?

32:24.984 --> 32:27.320
Uh-huh. Okay.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.699
(sighs)

32:30.741 --> 32:32.367
(screams)

32:32.409 --> 32:34.244
Oh.
I got you.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.412
Oh, my God.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.872
Oh, my God, you did it!

32:36.914 --> 32:38.290
Yeah.
We did it!

32:38.331 --> 32:40.751
Yeah. I'm not gonna
let you fall.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.335
Oh!

32:42.377 --> 32:44.129
Mmm.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.380
This is it.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.632
This is my perfect moment.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.468
This is what I wanted
this whole weekend for.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.511
(sighs)

32:51.553 --> 32:55.515
Now I know nothing
can ever come between us.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.351
(sighs)
What is it?

32:58.393 --> 33:00.854
Is there something
you want to tell me?

33:03.106 --> 33:07.486
Why would I ruin
a perfect moment by talking?

33:12.950 --> 33:15.160
Naomi...

33:15.201 --> 33:17.329
I know about the kiss.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.498
You what?

33:22.417 --> 33:25.086
What are you doing?

33:30.300 --> 33:33.762
Alec trusted me enough
to tell me the truth.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.390
And you didn't.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.897
(sighs)

34:03.667 --> 34:05.585
You're back!

34:05.627 --> 34:07.504
Hey.
(laughing):
Hi.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.797
Mmm.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.799
Mmm.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.717
Uh, hey.
Hi.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.012
Uh, what-what
brought this on?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.138
Oh, I just missed you so much.

34:19.683 --> 34:22.768
Mmm.
Okay, so I-I'm guessing
the video shoot went well.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.022
It was just a dress rehearsal.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.024
(laughs)

34:27.106 --> 34:31.110
Well, whatever it was-- I mean,
the outfit, the attitude--

34:31.152 --> 34:32.654
it's working
for you.
Mm-hmm.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.489
And it's working
for me, too.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.659
Yeah. (laughs)

34:37.701 --> 34:39.578
Remind me to thank
Taylor later.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.833
You know what?
It's, um, getting late.

34:45.542 --> 34:46.626
We should go to sleep.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.212
We can talk more
in the morning.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.297
Wait...

34:54.592 --> 34:56.762
(crickets chirping)

34:58.638 --> 35:01.516
The camp people told me
you got a ride back into town.

35:01.558 --> 35:06.396
I was afraid
I wouldn't find you here.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.941
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth, Naomi?

35:08.982 --> 35:10.149
Max, Alec set me up.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.110
He kissed me, and had someone
take photos of us.

35:12.151 --> 35:13.070
I know that.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.697
He-he was
trying to prove

35:15.739 --> 35:19.200
that you had cheated on me once,
and that you would do it again.

35:19.242 --> 35:22.203
He said that you would
never tell me about the kiss.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.581
I said he was wrong.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.541
I was going to tell you,
I swear to God.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.960
I was waiting
for the perfect moment,

35:28.001 --> 35:29.252
and it never came.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.923
I spent the entire weekend
trying to get you to trust me.

35:32.965 --> 35:35.425
What are you so afraid of?

35:37.343 --> 35:40.097
Well, why should you believe me,
Max?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.222
You know, Alec is right.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.935
I mean, I've done horrible,
horrible things.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.604
So, why should you ever
trust me again?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.817
Well, 'cause
I kind of thought

35:51.858 --> 35:54.402
that that's what
love was all about.

35:59.783 --> 36:03.369
Max, I am sorry.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.290
I'm so sorry.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.253
I promise
I will try to do better.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.798
Will you please forgive me
just one more time?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.467
I can't lose you.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.055
I can't.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.474
You really hurt me, Naomi.

36:26.225 --> 36:29.813
I don't...

36:29.855 --> 36:32.983
I don't know if we can go
back to the way we were before.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.500
(crowd chatter)

36:53.003 --> 36:54.337
I rewrote my paper.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.672
No Wikipedia.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.798
Stayed up all night.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.508
Really?

36:58.550 --> 37:02.679
I thought you spent your weekend
being rescued by your costar.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.930
(sighs)

37:03.972 --> 37:06.058
All right, look,
I know you don't think

37:06.099 --> 37:07.475
I'm serious about your class,

37:07.517 --> 37:08.476
or anything, really,

37:08.518 --> 37:09.811
but succeeding here
is important to me,

37:09.853 --> 37:11.771
and I'm going to work hard
to make sure that happens.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.107
I have students in my class
that work full-time

37:14.149 --> 37:15.734
to put themselves
through school,

37:15.775 --> 37:18.319
yet they managed to turn in
fully-researched papers on time.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.613
Still, here you are,
asking for special treatment.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.865
I just want a chance.

37:21.907 --> 37:22.908
I already gave you a chance.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.659
And I gave you an
"F" on this report.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.285
Hey!
What did you think?

37:26.327 --> 37:27.954
That you were just
gonna flash that smile,

37:27.996 --> 37:29.414
and I'd swoon like
some moon-eyed groupie?

37:29.455 --> 37:31.791
As of right now, you're
failing my class.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.293
Feel free to drop
out at any point.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.756
NAVID:
Just finish this side,

37:37.797 --> 37:39.257
and we need one more coat, and

37:39.298 --> 37:40.800
you're good to do.

37:40.842 --> 37:42.427
Appreciate it.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.470
Hey.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.556
You made it.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.017
Uh... Dixon I wanted
to talk to you.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.103
I'm just
dropping off the keys, man.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.563
Dixon, about yesterday.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.690
When that actress showed up,
I realized that sometimes

37:55.732 --> 37:58.484
I don't think before I speak,
and I just... I ruin everything.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.570
And, hey, I don't want you
to think

38:00.612 --> 38:01.821
that this was anything personal.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.448
It was just a business decision.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.491
Yeah.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.077
Yeah, no sweat.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.162
Really? 'Cause, dude,
you have no idea...

38:09.204 --> 38:11.248
I spoke to Liam this morning.
Seems he'd love

38:11.289 --> 38:13.291
for me to open this club.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.044
Liam owns this bar, not you,

38:16.086 --> 38:17.879
which means you lose.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.674
It was just a business decision.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.760
I hope we can still be friends.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.696
(phone rings)

38:45.949 --> 38:47.784
Hey, sweetie.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.911
I was just thinking about you.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.505
♪ ♪

39:08.387 --> 39:10.640
Excuse me?

39:10.682 --> 39:12.433
Do you know
where I can sign up?

39:29.284 --> 39:32.871
I cannot believe
I got to feed a baby tiger!

39:32.912 --> 39:36.499
He was so cute.
And all those baby crocodiles.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.544
How did you know all those
people at the animal reserve?

39:39.585 --> 39:42.297
Oh, I used to volunteer at a
game reserve in Kenya, and plus,

39:42.339 --> 39:43.381
I helped one of those guys

39:43.422 --> 39:44.757
get his nude photos
down off the Web.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.343
Mm. You are such a liar.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.095
Well, um, that was

39:49.137 --> 39:51.556
maybe the best date ever.

39:51.597 --> 39:52.807
Yeah?

39:52.849 --> 39:55.310
I'm glad things didn't work out
with that other guy.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.395
Me, too.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.030
Good night.

40:09.615 --> 40:13.328
Oh, you're back.

40:13.370 --> 40:16.081
Ah, did you have an actual date
with Colin?

40:16.122 --> 40:18.333
Well, looks like you and Max
might have a cool couple

40:18.375 --> 40:19.542
to hang out with after all.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.544
How was your fantasy weekend?

40:21.586 --> 40:24.089
Uh, Max and I...

40:24.130 --> 40:27.050
hit a bit of a speed bump.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.719
But... that's all right.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.139
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.
