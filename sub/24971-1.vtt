01:48.964 --> 01:51.932
<i>The kingdom, Niklaus,
the kingdom.</i>

01:51.934 --> 01:54.371
<i>You must defend the kingdom.</i>

02:54.797 --> 02:57.333
<i>These pieces,
these soldiers,</i>

02:57.933 --> 03:01.870
<i>they're your only defense
of the kingdom.</i>

03:01.872 --> 03:04.075
<i>The kingdom.</i>

03:47.150 --> 03:48.252
The kingdom.

04:12.275 --> 04:14.408
- Welcome, Jane.
- It's good to be here.

04:14.410 --> 04:16.312
Well, this time around.

04:17.046 --> 04:19.882
I completely understand,
Jane, and it's good to see you too.

04:21.183 --> 04:24.154
Amy is very excited
to be going home.

04:25.087 --> 04:27.825
So, tell me, are you still
at the same address?

04:28.190 --> 04:28.958
I am.

04:30.292 --> 04:32.594
And that's
the same address where...

04:32.596 --> 04:35.063
Well, we're not going
straight home, Doctor.

04:35.065 --> 04:36.431
We're actually
visiting relatives

04:36.433 --> 04:38.868
at a really nice
bed-and-breakfast, Anders Manor.

04:39.436 --> 04:40.404
I thought...

04:41.438 --> 04:44.508
neutral territory,
familiar faces, her cousins.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.943
She was really close with them
when she was little.

04:48.144 --> 04:49.213
Jane...

04:50.246 --> 04:52.849
I'm worried about her
flashing back to the...

04:53.416 --> 04:54.351
accident.

04:55.351 --> 04:57.121
Well, we're going.

05:38.395 --> 05:39.563
What is this, Father?

05:41.130 --> 05:44.364
This... it's a game, Niklaus.

05:44.366 --> 05:45.602
Like checkers?

05:46.101 --> 05:49.272
No, checkers
is for the simpletons.

05:49.505 --> 05:51.642
For the babies,
like tic-tac-toe.

05:52.075 --> 05:54.542
This, this is chess.

05:54.544 --> 05:56.012
The game of kings.

06:00.349 --> 06:02.018
The game of kings.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.330
So, happy birthday.

06:14.229 --> 06:15.530
Are you excited
to see the family?

06:15.532 --> 06:16.467
A little bit.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.236
I remember
Uncle Ethan was funny.

06:21.371 --> 06:23.974
Aunt Eva was weird, but caring.

06:25.976 --> 06:27.378
Trevor was always nice.

06:28.445 --> 06:30.712
I don't know. It seems like
such a long time ago.

06:30.714 --> 06:32.049
Everything's kind of a blur.

06:34.351 --> 06:36.583
I just can't believe you're 18.

06:36.585 --> 06:39.152
I can't either.

06:39.154 --> 06:42.155
It's like I woke up with tits all of a sudden
and they let me out of the loony bin for it.

06:42.157 --> 06:42.992
Hey.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.428
Well...

06:48.164 --> 06:49.162
Are you sure you're ready
for this?

06:49.164 --> 06:51.498
Because you and I can go
to a hotel by ourselves.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.503
I want this.

06:54.236 --> 06:56.205
We both deserve a vacation
at this point.

06:59.174 --> 07:00.109
Well...

07:01.443 --> 07:02.512
let's go have some fun.

07:11.587 --> 07:14.388
Ladies.
A gracious new day to you both.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.189
- Come in, come in. Please.
- Thank you.

07:16.191 --> 07:17.493
Welcome to Anders Manor.

07:22.032 --> 07:24.532
- I am Niklaus Anders.
- I am Jane.

07:24.534 --> 07:27.438
- And this is my daughter, Amy.
- Amy, nice to meet you.

07:28.070 --> 07:31.506
We're Jane and Amy Hunter. My sister, Eva
Clark, made the reservations for us.

07:31.508 --> 07:33.674
- Is she here yet?
- She's not here at the moment.

07:33.676 --> 07:35.710
They're on an outing,
but they'll be back

07:35.712 --> 07:38.015
and they've instructed me
to remind you...

07:39.715 --> 07:42.118
- Let me take your bags, please.
- Thank you.

07:42.385 --> 07:43.454
And let's get you all...

07:44.721 --> 07:46.390
nestled in snugly here.

07:46.722 --> 07:47.390
Thank you.

07:49.258 --> 07:51.659
This place is lovely.
How long have you been here?

07:51.661 --> 07:53.564
Sometimes it seems like forever.

07:54.563 --> 07:56.165
This was my father's place.

07:57.534 --> 07:59.370
<i>His father built it by hand
over a hundred years ago...</i>

08:01.404 --> 08:02.706
Am I a king, Father?

08:03.205 --> 08:04.440
Well...

08:04.840 --> 08:06.509
you may be a prince.

08:07.409 --> 08:08.645
And I the king.

08:09.378 --> 08:12.679
The king of Anders Manor.

08:12.681 --> 08:15.849
So, we've set aside
a particularly lovely room

08:15.851 --> 08:19.222
that I think will be perfectly
suitable to the young lady.

08:19.556 --> 08:22.592
It's just down here.
Your first door on the left.

08:23.659 --> 08:25.294
So, if you would.

08:26.628 --> 08:28.198
You know what, I'll take
mine as well. -Sure.

08:52.554 --> 08:53.790
- Amy.
- No.

08:54.491 --> 08:57.226
Um... I think someone's
already staying in there.

08:58.127 --> 09:01.564
No, not possible.
It's a room I rarely rent out.

09:01.831 --> 09:03.433
It belonged
to a dear cousin of mine.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.200
Amy, see? There's nobody
in that room, sweetie.

09:07.202 --> 09:10.904
No. No, it's fine. It's fine. There's
nothing in there, right, Mom?

09:10.906 --> 09:12.442
- Right. There's nothing in that room.
- Nothing there.

09:13.143 --> 09:14.678
Okay. She's fine.

09:22.784 --> 09:24.551
So, your daughter...

09:24.553 --> 09:26.553
She has a mental illness,
I'm afraid.

09:26.555 --> 09:29.190
Well, I am so sorry.
She's such a lovely girl.

09:29.192 --> 09:31.825
She is a very sweet girl.

09:31.827 --> 09:35.665
It's just, sometimes she sees
things that aren't actually there.

09:36.399 --> 09:38.798
Well, I can assure you that, for as
long as she's here at the manor,

09:38.800 --> 09:41.404
she'll have all the peace
and tranquility that she needs.

09:42.704 --> 09:43.773
Thank you so much.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.344
That's why we're here, you know,
we just want a fresh start.

09:47.776 --> 09:49.879
Well, toward that point,

09:50.380 --> 09:53.150
we will be having additional guests
here this evening, some hunters.

09:53.415 --> 09:55.550
They'll be joining us for dinner
at 4:00 p.m.,

09:55.552 --> 09:58.455
after which, we'll be having
a cotton candy social,

09:58.688 --> 10:00.323
and a bonfire on the grounds.

10:00.789 --> 10:03.657
I think I'll catch up with my
sister tonight, but thank you.

10:03.659 --> 10:04.627
As you wish.

10:10.433 --> 10:11.335
<i>Teach me to play, Father.</i>

10:14.871 --> 10:15.905
Well...

10:18.741 --> 10:19.809
This is the king.

10:20.809 --> 10:22.545
The most powerful piece
on the board.

10:23.313 --> 10:24.847
And yet, the weakest,

10:25.414 --> 10:26.516
the most vulnerable.

10:29.552 --> 10:32.322
The outcome of the game
depends on his survival.

10:33.990 --> 10:37.260
Like a father,
he leads and loves.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.629
He loves and leads.

10:42.231 --> 10:43.266
And when he dies...

10:45.400 --> 10:46.335
that's it.

10:47.236 --> 10:48.171
The game is over.

10:54.810 --> 10:56.009
Jane.

10:57.981 --> 11:00.715
Oh. Christ, Jane,
it's been so long.

11:00.717 --> 11:01.585
I know.

11:01.918 --> 11:03.984
You look great.

11:03.986 --> 11:05.920
Please, I've been driving all day.
You look great, as always.

11:07.756 --> 11:08.891
Hello, Janie. Who doesn't lie
about things of beauty?

11:09.759 --> 11:11.428
You look just like you did
at the wedding.

11:11.861 --> 11:13.330
That was 20 years ago, Ethan.

11:14.529 --> 11:15.665
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

11:17.266 --> 11:18.267
- Let's go catch up.
- Okay.

12:26.903 --> 12:28.636
Sweetie, it's time for dinner.

12:28.638 --> 12:30.641
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

12:39.549 --> 12:40.951
Oh, happy birthday, Amy.

12:42.818 --> 12:43.919
Thanks.

12:44.419 --> 12:46.289
You remember
your Uncle Ethan, right?

12:46.621 --> 12:48.891
We haven't seen you since you were
ass-high to a grasshopper, but...

12:49.858 --> 12:51.694
you used to play with Trevor
and Blair in the backyard.

12:52.861 --> 12:53.896
I remember.

12:54.364 --> 12:55.632
Well, it's good
to see you again, honey.

12:57.533 --> 12:58.502
Hi, Aunt Eva.

12:58.701 --> 12:59.635
Hi, sweetie.

13:00.770 --> 13:03.406
Hi, Blair. Hi, Trevor.

13:03.872 --> 13:07.343
Hi, Amy. It's nice to see you
again, too, and you look great.

13:07.909 --> 13:09.445
Well, it has been awhile.

13:13.382 --> 13:17.084
So, how were things
at the funny farm, coz?

13:17.086 --> 13:18.652
Damn it, Blair, come on.

13:18.654 --> 13:20.888
Highly inappropriate,
young lady.

13:20.890 --> 13:24.157
And Blair, is your ass jealous from all the
shit that just came out of your mouth?

13:24.159 --> 13:25.395
Damn it, Trevor.

13:25.827 --> 13:27.430
You know, Trevor,

13:28.832 --> 13:30.467
I really would like to see things
from your point of view, but...

13:30.766 --> 13:33.002
I can't get my head
that far up my own ass.

13:33.502 --> 13:36.439
Wow, your children really have
grown up so much, haven't they?

13:37.506 --> 13:39.540
Blair and Trevor,
I love you both very much,

13:39.542 --> 13:41.044
but if you don't stop,

13:41.510 --> 13:43.347
you won't believe what happens next.

13:45.648 --> 13:47.451
Excuse me, please.

13:49.619 --> 13:50.454
I'm not hungry.

13:52.521 --> 13:54.724
Welcome to the fun.

13:59.161 --> 14:00.363
If you'll excuse me.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.468
The huntsmen have arrived!

14:07.470 --> 14:10.140
Gentlemen, welcome, welcome.
Come in, come in, come in.

14:10.539 --> 14:12.605
- Welcome to Anders Manor.
- Thank you, sir.

14:12.607 --> 14:15.611
I trust that your travels were without
undue difficulty? -All good, sir.

14:15.845 --> 14:18.612
You would be Brett, I presume,
and these your compatriots.

14:18.614 --> 14:19.549
Yes, sir.

14:20.549 --> 14:21.916
My brother, Darsaw.

14:21.918 --> 14:23.653
- Very nice to meet you.
- Much obliged, Mr. Anders.

14:25.121 --> 14:27.754
And I cannot thank you enough for
opening up your fine grounds to us,

14:27.756 --> 14:30.056
so we may kill and eat
some indigenous wildlife.

14:30.058 --> 14:31.825
Yes. And this would be?

14:31.827 --> 14:34.029
- And Ole.
- Ole, pleasure to meet you, sir.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.500
Pleasure, sir. My name's Ole.

14:36.765 --> 14:38.467
Outstanding, Ole.

14:39.534 --> 14:40.569
And may I say,

14:41.536 --> 14:44.171
you have a lovely looking
establishment here.

14:44.173 --> 14:45.475
Well,
thank you very much.

14:47.543 --> 14:50.414
Dinner's being served presently.
Put your bags down, please, relax.

14:50.679 --> 14:52.680
The Reverend Thomas
will be joining us presently.

14:52.682 --> 14:54.614
He's on his way.

14:54.616 --> 14:57.953
He'll be presiding later this evening
over a cotton candy social and bonfire.

14:58.888 --> 15:01.425
Thank you, sir. In reference
to our arrangement for our rate,

15:02.191 --> 15:04.557
my brother Darsaw here, will be
willing to cut your firewood up.

15:04.559 --> 15:05.529
- Very good.
- I will?

15:06.161 --> 15:06.996
Yes, you will.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.967
Well, I'm assuming
you're all hungry, correct?

15:11.534 --> 15:12.736
- Very.
- Please, come with me.

15:22.044 --> 15:23.212
"Very."

15:32.154 --> 15:34.924
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to present to you,

15:35.257 --> 15:38.993
Darsaw, Ole, and Brett,
the Bayton boys.

15:38.995 --> 15:41.498
They're here to do some
buck hunting this weekend.

15:41.731 --> 15:42.765
Hey, y'all.

15:52.708 --> 15:53.676
Damn, Darsaw, you sure
know how to clear out a room.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.654
Back at the manor.

16:05.888 --> 16:08.122
Our annual
fall prison sentence.

16:08.124 --> 16:09.159
Mm, I love it.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.161
- Mm-hm.
- I fucking hate this place.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.731
You know what I did love...

16:14.996 --> 16:16.663
...was the meal that
Charlie Manson served.

16:16.665 --> 16:17.931
Oh! The gray matter?

16:17.933 --> 16:19.700
- The gray matter. It was very nice.
- Delicious.

16:19.702 --> 16:20.703
Did you see the eyeball
in the teeth?

16:21.736 --> 16:22.905
The guy scares me.

16:23.606 --> 16:24.805
He's the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

16:24.807 --> 16:25.675
Mm.

16:26.308 --> 16:28.975
Oh, speaking of the which, um...

16:28.977 --> 16:31.180
Did you see those three hunters
that showed up?

16:31.914 --> 16:33.850
- Maybe.
- They were cute, weren't they?

16:35.284 --> 16:36.886
Maybe.

16:38.355 --> 16:39.623
It's been about an hour and a half.
You haven't fucked anybody yet?

16:44.092 --> 16:46.695
You mean, like you fucking your
cousin the last time we were here?

16:48.831 --> 16:49.666
Hm.

16:50.299 --> 16:51.300
That happened.

16:53.302 --> 16:55.205
You're adorable.

16:55.638 --> 16:58.074
You are adorable. Hm.

17:01.776 --> 17:02.845
<i>Hey, lady.</i>

17:05.781 --> 17:07.717
Come on, are you serious?

17:09.251 --> 17:12.055
No, I'm not in town
this weekend. I'm...

17:12.988 --> 17:16.823
with my family at this place
we go a couple times a year

17:16.825 --> 17:18.727
and desperately try
to act normal.

17:20.161 --> 17:23.967
Yeah,
it's called Anders Manor.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.035
It's so lame.

17:27.836 --> 17:29.104
No.

17:29.371 --> 17:31.173
Look, do you remember, um...

17:31.873 --> 17:34.877
that cousin that I told you
about, the super crazy one?

17:36.812 --> 17:40.046
<i>Yeah, well, she checked out of
the loony bin today,</i>

17:40.048 --> 17:43.752
<i>so we're all here to throw her a
"Welcome Back to the Family" party.</i>

18:04.140 --> 18:09.810
Amy, do you understand that even
though you may feel a shock,

18:09.812 --> 18:11.982
it will not break the hypnosis?

18:12.313 --> 18:14.982
You will relax immediately,

18:14.984 --> 18:18.053
noting only the pain,
and its lesson.

18:18.787 --> 18:20.957
You will remain in a trance.

18:21.724 --> 18:23.293
Do you understand that, Amy?

18:24.959 --> 18:25.661
Yes.

18:26.227 --> 18:27.363
Very good.

18:28.163 --> 18:32.735
Now, Amy,
you are a tiny caterpillar,

18:33.002 --> 18:34.871
crawling across a leaf.

18:35.838 --> 18:36.940
What are you, Amy?

18:38.006 --> 18:39.409
I'm a tiny caterpillar.

18:44.479 --> 18:46.248
Very good, Amy.

18:47.082 --> 18:50.117
Now, we're gonna
spin you a cocoon of good drugs

18:50.119 --> 18:51.484
and helpful therapy.

18:51.486 --> 18:55.225
And while you're in that cocoon,
you won't feel any pain.

18:55.791 --> 18:58.227
And when you emerge
from the cocoon...

18:58.794 --> 19:01.864
you will be
a beautiful butterfly.

19:39.034 --> 19:42.304
I'm sorry. I was a complete and
total asshole to you at dinner.

19:44.105 --> 19:46.439
I didn't want to come this
weekend and my parents made me

19:46.441 --> 19:47.943
and I'm pissed at them,
not at you.

19:49.879 --> 19:50.714
Still cousins?

19:54.449 --> 19:56.218
Look, I feel really bad, okay?

19:58.888 --> 19:59.723
Friends?

20:03.793 --> 20:05.794
Well, boys, you like?

20:06.262 --> 20:07.263
I like.

20:08.030 --> 20:09.866
That MILF,
you see those titties?

20:11.332 --> 20:13.433
Man, wait until you see them
True Believers.

20:13.435 --> 20:14.838
The what?

20:16.072 --> 20:18.073
The True Believers, man. They're
a church group or something.

20:18.373 --> 20:20.876
Man, church girls
don't put out no poon.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.045
Yeah, well, these ones do.

20:24.045 --> 20:25.849
Universalists, or some shit.

20:26.815 --> 20:28.418
What about that retarded girl?

20:29.051 --> 20:30.086
Kind of cute.

20:30.451 --> 20:31.353
"Butterface" cute.

20:33.221 --> 20:35.424
Ole, man, listen to me
right now, all right?

20:36.324 --> 20:38.827
That girl broke in the head.
You stay away from her.

20:42.331 --> 20:44.967
I remember playing superheroes
with you and...

20:45.967 --> 20:47.504
pushing you on the swing
when we were six.

20:49.205 --> 20:50.173
You were totally normal.

20:53.508 --> 20:54.810
What happened, Amy?

20:56.378 --> 20:57.413
I got sick.

20:58.913 --> 20:59.815
That's all.

21:01.283 --> 21:02.552
I'm taking meds for it now.

21:03.518 --> 21:05.188
Yeah, but, like,
crazy sick though, right?

21:08.056 --> 21:09.458
Sometimes I don't know
what's real.

21:10.559 --> 21:11.928
And it seems real to me.

21:13.361 --> 21:14.229
Like...

21:14.964 --> 21:15.932
Playing superheroes, but...

21:17.166 --> 21:19.131
But thinking that you're
actually a superhero.

21:19.133 --> 21:21.103
Like an acid trip.

21:22.371 --> 21:24.407
People know they're
hallucinating on an acid trip.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.184
Is there anything I can do to make
up for what I said at dinner?

21:36.418 --> 21:37.286
Yeah.

21:39.287 --> 21:40.489
Do you know how to do makeup?

21:45.561 --> 21:48.063
Step into my office.

21:49.063 --> 21:50.496
I'm gonna make you look
so expensive.

22:33.242 --> 22:34.944
Mm-mm-mm!

22:35.576 --> 22:38.480
Like a ripe, juicy fruit.

22:39.081 --> 22:39.881
You're going to get pregnant.

22:41.015 --> 22:42.951
Actually,
I'm on the pill, shithead.

22:43.718 --> 22:44.553
Syphilis then.

22:46.522 --> 22:48.057
Why are you guys
so mean to each other?

22:49.658 --> 22:50.493
- Love.
- Love.

22:52.061 --> 22:53.961
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

22:53.963 --> 22:55.696
The curlers hurt my head.

22:55.698 --> 22:57.600
Beauty is pain, Cousin.

22:58.566 --> 23:00.535
Anyone who tells you otherwise
is selling some bullshit.

23:28.197 --> 23:29.198
This is it,
True Believers.

23:36.104 --> 23:36.939
Let's set it up.

23:37.706 --> 23:38.975
Come on, True Believers.

23:42.710 --> 23:43.645
Set it up.

23:49.150 --> 23:50.486
Let's party with the Lord!

23:52.254 --> 23:53.156
Who is it?

23:54.090 --> 23:54.655
It's the Wicked Witch
of the West.

23:54.657 --> 23:55.789
Open the goddamn door.

23:57.659 --> 23:59.158
Come on in, Eva.

23:59.160 --> 24:00.964
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

24:04.132 --> 24:07.002
Come over here and have
a drink with me by the window.

24:07.468 --> 24:09.639
And let's watch boys
carry heavy things.

24:10.538 --> 24:12.374
What are we, 16 and 18 again?

24:12.673 --> 24:16.044
Well, let's just pretend
we are, okay?

24:17.379 --> 24:19.716
I mean, I haven't seen you
since the funeral.

24:22.418 --> 24:23.252
That's true.

24:24.218 --> 24:25.087
Oh.

24:28.724 --> 24:29.622
- Yay!
- Mm.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.128
Oh.

24:33.094 --> 24:34.496
- Look, I've gotta tell you...
- Oh my gosh.

24:34.696 --> 24:36.796
...I've got dibs on the one
with the fur hat.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.577
Well... boys, I'll leave you two
to get settled.

24:48.544 --> 24:49.277
Darsaw...

24:50.379 --> 24:52.381
Thanks for chopping
that firewood there, Pumpkin.

24:53.815 --> 24:55.351
Brett don't chop no wood.

24:56.418 --> 24:58.318
Relax, you big babies.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.024
I'll be back,
and I'll have beer.

25:49.838 --> 25:51.541
We all come together,

25:52.807 --> 25:54.509
and we all go apart.

25:55.811 --> 25:59.082
I said we all come together!

25:59.747 --> 26:01.583
And we all go apart.

26:02.650 --> 26:03.753
Like atoms...

26:05.387 --> 26:06.389
like stars.

26:07.890 --> 26:09.725
Did you get cotton candy?

26:10.592 --> 26:11.660
Ice cream?

26:13.227 --> 26:15.264
So nice to know
your bodies are nourished.

26:16.665 --> 26:18.501
Now, it's time
to nourish our souls.

26:19.301 --> 26:20.403
If you would...

26:21.536 --> 26:22.572
breathe in with me!

26:24.640 --> 26:25.574
And breathe out.

26:28.744 --> 26:30.246
Breathe in with me!

26:33.548 --> 26:34.783
And breathe out.

26:38.954 --> 26:40.223
Welcome...

26:41.390 --> 26:42.888
my True Believers.

26:47.862 --> 26:48.831
You, stay.

26:55.403 --> 26:57.140
So, how do you think
she's adjusting?

26:59.207 --> 27:00.743
Well, Ethan,
I already see a difference.

27:05.214 --> 27:06.515
Well, Niklaus did it again.

27:06.814 --> 27:08.683
Everything is wonderful,
as always.

27:21.796 --> 27:23.165
Good. It's good.

27:24.832 --> 27:25.700
Thank you.

27:29.403 --> 27:30.172
Thank you.

27:31.005 --> 27:32.606
God loves you.

27:32.608 --> 27:33.876
Jesus loves you.

27:34.610 --> 27:37.346
Muhammad loves you.
Shiva loves you.

27:37.778 --> 27:39.448
And the Goddess love you.

27:40.349 --> 27:41.884
It doesn't matter
if you believe.

27:43.451 --> 27:45.621
It doesn't matter at all,
love doesn't care.

27:46.388 --> 27:48.757
Brothers and sisters,
love doesn't care.

27:49.957 --> 27:51.861
So, let's crank up the tunes.

27:53.961 --> 27:55.263
Fire up the pit.

27:56.598 --> 27:58.201
And let's rejoice.

27:58.734 --> 28:01.533
Let's rejoice,
in the name of love.

28:15.383 --> 28:17.252
Hello, brothers and sisters.

28:18.986 --> 28:21.524
- What can we do for you, um...
- Darsaw.

28:22.291 --> 28:23.592
Darsaw Bayton.

28:23.859 --> 28:25.794
You see,
I was just feeling the spirit,

28:26.294 --> 28:28.727
and I figured I'd come over and
lend a friendly hand to you all.

28:32.668 --> 28:34.570
Uh, Trevor. Trevor Clark.

28:35.403 --> 28:36.771
Genuine pleasure, Trevor.

28:37.005 --> 28:38.241
I'm Blair.

28:39.573 --> 28:41.310
- Blair Clark.
- Ma'am.

28:43.778 --> 28:44.980
And you are?

28:48.582 --> 28:51.583
Actually, my business is with you, Trevor.
Can I borrow you for a minute?

28:51.585 --> 28:52.819
- Me?
- Of course I can.

28:52.821 --> 28:53.656
Seriously?

28:55.690 --> 28:58.992
My brother, Ole... He pulled
his back out stacking firewood.

28:58.994 --> 29:01.994
You know, he's as useless
as tits on a bull, that one.

29:01.996 --> 29:05.935
And, well, I got a ton of gear in my
truck and it's a two-person lift.

29:06.935 --> 29:09.371
Help a brother out, would you?
Say yes.

29:09.905 --> 29:12.571
I mean, I love that girl
with all of my breaking heart,

29:12.573 --> 29:14.009
but we didn't know
what we were getting into.

29:15.444 --> 29:19.415
I know. I've heard so many stories
of heartbreak when people adopt.

29:20.349 --> 29:22.851
I mean, you just never know what
family history you're gonna get.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.753
- Nice and easy, okay?
- Okay.

29:27.755 --> 29:29.089
- Nice and easy, okay?
- Careful, my hand...

29:29.091 --> 29:30.359
It's slipping.

29:30.859 --> 29:32.328
Nice and easy.

29:36.031 --> 29:37.366
There's precious cargo in here.

29:39.735 --> 29:40.569
What the hell.

29:44.438 --> 29:45.041
So...

29:46.707 --> 29:47.642
I gotta ask you...

29:49.945 --> 29:51.514
What's up with you
and old "Barbie?"

29:52.848 --> 29:55.651
- Who, Amy?
- Yeah. She's hot as hell, man.

29:56.016 --> 29:56.919
Oh...

29:57.518 --> 29:58.753
Dude, she's my cousin.

30:00.822 --> 30:02.757
Big deal.
What, you've probably seen her

30:03.091 --> 30:05.727
three, four, maybe five times
in your life?

30:06.061 --> 30:07.463
Cousin, schmousin.

30:08.463 --> 30:09.665
It's fair game, in my book.

30:19.940 --> 30:20.976
What the hell...

30:24.412 --> 30:25.347
Her and I...

30:26.515 --> 30:27.550
we had a thing.

30:28.048 --> 30:28.849
- You and her?
- Yeah.

30:29.684 --> 30:32.388
Me and Amy,
last trip to the manor.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.757
Yeah, I... I was...

30:35.791 --> 30:38.060
16, and she was 14.

30:40.061 --> 30:42.698
- I knew that I liked you.
- Well, I... It was weird.

30:43.698 --> 30:45.567
I mean, I... It was weird. It...

30:47.201 --> 30:48.636
Weird now even being back here.

30:49.771 --> 30:50.840
I'll bet it is.

30:51.072 --> 30:51.806
Look, we were...

30:52.774 --> 30:55.044
young, you know?

30:55.877 --> 30:56.912
Exploring.

30:57.144 --> 30:58.913
Nothing-better-to-do kind
of stuff.

31:01.149 --> 31:05.053
I could be way off base, but I
think you still kind of like her.

31:08.290 --> 31:12.428
Well, maybe, tonight you guys
can rekindle some of that

31:12.994 --> 31:13.926
"manor magic."

31:17.466 --> 31:19.001
No, I don't think so.

31:20.735 --> 31:23.903
But I... I will take
another beer.

31:23.905 --> 31:24.870
[clears throat

31:24.872 --> 31:25.506
All right.

31:27.476 --> 31:28.843
Now you're speaking my language.

31:31.246 --> 31:32.747
You like taking pictures?

31:34.048 --> 31:35.517
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

31:36.184 --> 31:37.486
Uh, yeah.

31:42.556 --> 31:43.726
Don't be scared.

31:44.726 --> 31:46.562
I like taking pictures, too.

31:47.963 --> 31:49.532
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:50.265 --> 31:51.766
But I like being in them better.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.036
Hey, come on,
take a picture of me.

31:56.004 --> 31:57.773
- What?
- Yeah, that's right.

31:58.206 --> 32:00.208
I'll even pose
right nice for you.

32:01.976 --> 32:02.945
Hmm.

32:03.978 --> 32:05.014
Okay.

32:07.849 --> 32:09.115
Okay, got it.

32:09.117 --> 32:10.686
Okay, okay, let's shoot.

32:11.186 --> 32:13.456
I'll pose again for you.
I'll give you another pose.

32:17.158 --> 32:18.159
We're good.

32:18.826 --> 32:19.627
Let me see.

32:19.995 --> 32:21.530
Excuse me?

32:21.963 --> 32:24.731
Can't you show me
on that little screen of yours?

32:24.733 --> 32:26.666
Uh, I really should get going
back to the party.

32:26.668 --> 32:28.067
You ain't going nowhere.

32:37.611 --> 32:39.081
It's a good shot.

32:39.813 --> 32:42.016
You sure can take
a good picture.

32:44.052 --> 32:47.555
Thanks. Uh, I really should
get back to the party.

32:49.157 --> 32:50.192
You have a nice night.

32:51.860 --> 32:52.828
Yeah. You, too.

33:04.139 --> 33:06.805
- Your hair looks so good like this.
- Thanks.

33:06.807 --> 33:07.775
I'll teach you how to do it.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.015
Hey. I'm Ole.

33:14.849 --> 33:15.918
Ole Bayton.

33:18.687 --> 33:20.622
You sure are purtier
than when I saw you earlier.

33:24.626 --> 33:25.294
Don't go.

33:25.994 --> 33:26.996
Stay.

33:27.661 --> 33:29.161
Just wanna be friends.

33:29.163 --> 33:30.565
Excuse me, sister, uh...

33:31.699 --> 33:33.966
You mind if I rap to you
for a minute at the gazebo?

33:33.968 --> 33:34.803
Um-hm.

33:36.271 --> 33:38.140
Brother, you don't mind
if I talk to the sister?

33:38.872 --> 33:40.543
Let me rap for a minute.
Are you all right with that?

34:15.976 --> 34:17.947
If you can forgive
my bluntness, but sister...

34:19.079 --> 34:21.949
Your aura right now
is screaming, like, whoa!

34:23.985 --> 34:24.753
Um...

34:25.820 --> 34:26.621
I'm sick.

34:28.054 --> 34:28.922
In my brain.

34:30.123 --> 34:31.193
Bummer.

34:35.896 --> 34:38.666
- You're funny.
- No, sister, it's called charm.

34:39.099 --> 34:40.268
True love.

34:41.135 --> 34:42.704
Compassion.

34:43.704 --> 34:44.938
What makes you sick, sister?

34:46.940 --> 34:50.079
Acute paranoid schizophrenia
with mild hallucinations.

34:51.978 --> 34:54.949
Sometimes, my imagination is real
to my brain, and I can't tell.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.018
And sometimes...

34:57.818 --> 35:00.788
my imagination's
really fucked up.

35:03.090 --> 35:03.925
Bummer.

35:09.097 --> 35:10.966
Are you on any
kind of treatment right now?

35:12.867 --> 35:15.269
Um, I just got out of in-patient
for four years.

35:17.072 --> 35:18.006
Today?

35:18.706 --> 35:20.909
Yeah... today.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.748
Intense.

35:29.983 --> 35:33.889
Five, four, three, two, one.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.392
Are you relaxed?

35:40.294 --> 35:42.831
Can you hear
the sound of my voice, Amy?

35:45.099 --> 35:46.934
- Yes.
- Good.

35:48.269 --> 35:50.205
Now, let's talk about the night
of the accident.

35:52.273 --> 35:53.108
I don't want to.

35:55.008 --> 35:57.079
Okay.
Let's talk about something else.

35:58.747 --> 36:00.315
Tell me about your dad.

36:01.182 --> 36:02.851
Tell me about David Hunter.

36:04.485 --> 36:05.887
I did a bad thing.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.459
What bad thing, Amy?

36:14.428 --> 36:15.164
I hurt my dad.

36:19.233 --> 36:20.168
He was bleeding.

36:21.503 --> 36:22.438
He stopped moving.

36:24.872 --> 36:26.407
Why did you hurt your dad?

36:30.544 --> 36:32.715
Bastard demon,
Aka Manah, tricked me.

36:35.416 --> 36:36.385
Still.

36:38.218 --> 36:39.421
He's still tricking me.

36:41.122 --> 36:41.957
Aka Manah.

36:43.858 --> 36:45.894
It's a demon that tries
to tell me what to do.

36:47.861 --> 36:49.465
Amy, did you say, "Aka Manah"?

36:50.298 --> 36:51.800
Yeah.

36:53.001 --> 36:54.403
<i>It's a demon.
It's part of my psychosis.</i>

36:55.403 --> 36:56.939
<i>But it's... It's made-up.</i>

36:57.305 --> 36:58.140
<i>The doctors told me.</i>

37:00.842 --> 37:03.845
Well, Amy, I don't mean to give
you hallucinations, but...

37:07.916 --> 37:09.818
<i>Aka Manah
is not a made-up demon.</i>

37:12.019 --> 37:12.755
He isn't?

37:14.289 --> 37:16.992
Tell me about Aka Manah,
the demon.

37:20.928 --> 37:21.863
He scares me.

37:26.568 --> 37:28.102
He tells me bad things.

37:30.037 --> 37:32.206
What kind of bad things?

37:38.912 --> 37:39.847
It's okay.

37:40.481 --> 37:41.483
You can tell me.

37:42.082 --> 37:44.318
You're safe under the trance.

37:45.954 --> 37:47.222
He said,
"Kill him, or die, Amy,"

37:48.423 --> 37:49.323
and I did.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.162
He tricked me...

37:56.331 --> 37:58.467
like he's still tricking me,
because I'm his...

38:01.535 --> 38:04.072
I'm his fucking puppet.

38:06.474 --> 38:07.976
Very good, Amy.

38:10.144 --> 38:13.982
Aka Manah literally means,
"evil mind."

38:16.017 --> 38:16.885
Listen...

38:18.218 --> 38:19.421
I'm gonna give you my card.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.025
You give me a call...

38:24.425 --> 38:25.894
when you need to hear
a friendly voice.

38:28.028 --> 38:30.431
Or if you just need somebody
to remind you...

38:31.365 --> 38:32.300
what's real.

38:35.068 --> 38:36.304
Rap at you later, sister.

38:45.546 --> 38:46.515
You know what?

38:47.548 --> 38:48.550
You're all right.

38:49.249 --> 38:51.085
You are all right.

38:52.552 --> 38:53.521
Not so bad yourself.

38:57.157 --> 38:58.326
You know, I was thinking...

38:59.528 --> 39:03.497
'cause you're a cool cat,
and I'm obviously a cool cat,

39:04.164 --> 39:07.235
maybe we could get
your purty lady,

39:08.035 --> 39:10.635
and I could find
a purty lady of my own.

39:10.637 --> 39:14.642
And we could explore
this here manor.

39:15.443 --> 39:20.015
And, I don't know, just happen
to stumble into my room,

39:21.282 --> 39:24.019
and polish off
these beers, and...

39:26.186 --> 39:28.055
get to know each other
a little better.

39:33.227 --> 39:35.998
So, sister,
how are things with Amy?

39:36.463 --> 39:39.467
She killed her damn husband because she
thought he was some sort of sex demon.

39:44.372 --> 39:46.909
Well, apparently,
I need to get some fresh air.

40:00.454 --> 40:03.455
Ma'am, when I first saw you,

40:03.457 --> 40:06.325
you reminded me
of a beautiful spring day.

40:08.729 --> 40:11.597
And I have been trying to get you alone for just
one moment, from the minute we locked eyes.

40:11.599 --> 40:13.499
Oh, my goodness.

40:13.501 --> 40:16.939
Well, Darsaw, I do declare,

40:17.472 --> 40:20.342
you... flatter.

40:21.175 --> 40:25.176
Well, if you are a kind woman,
you'd put me out of my misery,

40:25.178 --> 40:28.115
by allowing me
your fair company, ma'am.

40:35.655 --> 40:38.492
<i>I would just completely
stay away from that guy, Ole.</i>

40:40.260 --> 40:42.063
Thank you
for looking out for me.

40:43.597 --> 40:44.465
It's sweet.

40:46.467 --> 40:47.302
Yeah.

40:52.106 --> 40:53.175
And I like you a lot.

41:01.615 --> 41:02.985
And I want you.

41:03.818 --> 41:05.586
You... You're my cousin.

41:07.287 --> 41:10.191
Yeah... I'm adopted.

41:20.568 --> 41:21.370
Want some?

41:27.374 --> 41:29.276
This is the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

41:29.811 --> 41:31.113
I know.

41:32.146 --> 41:33.414
I love sunsets.

41:35.383 --> 41:36.752
I wasn't talking about
the sunset.

41:38.119 --> 41:39.318
I was looking at you.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.555
Oh...

41:41.756 --> 41:42.857
Thank you.

41:43.590 --> 41:47.395
I knew there was a sweetie
underneath all that flannel.

41:49.296 --> 41:50.765
Well, that's very nice
of you to say,

41:51.698 --> 41:52.800
but now that I think of it,

41:54.068 --> 41:57.139
it really is a very beautiful
place they got here, ain't it?

41:57.738 --> 42:01.539
It's funny, because I just really, really
didn't want to come here this time.

42:01.541 --> 42:05.046
But now that I'm here,
I kind of like it.

42:06.380 --> 42:07.381
You know, it's nice.

42:08.782 --> 42:09.650
Quiet.

42:12.119 --> 42:15.387
And, I haven't had the urge
to check my phone

42:15.389 --> 42:18.827
ever since somebody
walked through the door.

42:21.662 --> 42:26.134
Well, you know, it's kind of
like the great scholars say,

42:27.200 --> 42:30.338
"Less is, in fact, more."

42:31.838 --> 42:33.775
I like that.

42:34.307 --> 42:38.209
Well, you know, the manor does kind
of have its own unique charm to it.

42:38.211 --> 42:39.814
Yeah.

42:41.383 --> 42:44.186
Yeah, I like wandering around and looking
at all the weird little trinkets.

42:44.519 --> 42:45.553
Yep...

42:45.919 --> 42:47.688
the accommodations
ain't bad, either.

42:48.256 --> 42:50.725
- The rooms are kind of nice.
- Yeah.

42:51.758 --> 42:53.195
Mine's pretty cozy.

42:53.860 --> 42:54.728
Oh yeah?

42:55.930 --> 42:57.562
Mine ain't too shabby, either.

42:57.564 --> 42:58.867
Oh, is that right?

42:59.599 --> 43:04.202
I wonder if the, uh, layouts
are the same?

43:04.204 --> 43:06.238
- The couch is in the same spots...
- Yeah.

43:06.240 --> 43:07.705
...and the lamps.

43:07.707 --> 43:09.874
I wonder. I'm so curious.

43:09.876 --> 43:12.313
Say, I'll tell you what...

43:12.847 --> 43:16.218
if you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

43:18.619 --> 43:19.454
I can roll with that.

44:13.941 --> 44:14.943
Oh my God!

44:20.247 --> 44:21.182
What the fuck?

44:59.452 --> 45:02.389
When I first saw you,
it was like a spring day.

45:03.356 --> 45:07.361
I'd appreciate the pleasure
of your company.

45:08.329 --> 45:09.628
No!

45:09.630 --> 45:12.865
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Stop! Stop it!

45:12.867 --> 45:15.066
No! No! No!

45:15.068 --> 45:16.871
Quiet! Quiet!

45:37.957 --> 45:39.593
- Amy?
- What is that?

45:40.394 --> 45:42.061
Amy, honey, what's going...?

45:44.597 --> 45:46.999
Amy? Amy? Amy, it's Mom.

45:47.001 --> 45:48.470
Amy, it's Mom. It's Mom.

46:30.711 --> 46:31.646
Hey, Mom...

46:33.012 --> 46:34.512
Mom, I need my meds.

46:34.514 --> 46:35.849
Okay, okay. We'll get you them.

46:37.751 --> 46:39.952
Okay. It's okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

46:39.954 --> 46:41.452
Come on, it's just you and me.

46:41.454 --> 46:43.488
It's just you and me. Come on.

46:43.490 --> 46:45.860
We'll go to bed.
Remember, it's just you and me.

46:51.831 --> 46:53.034
<i>Am I like a king, Father?</i>

46:54.735 --> 46:57.738
You are but a lonely pawn,
my son.

46:58.439 --> 47:00.775
A pawn? I don't understand.

47:02.510 --> 47:03.378
Well...

47:05.780 --> 47:07.048
each piece is different.

47:08.481 --> 47:09.983
Each one has
a different role to play.

47:11.117 --> 47:12.653
They're unique.

47:13.988 --> 47:16.524
Some people say that one piece may
be more powerful than another...

47:17.425 --> 47:19.794
or have a higher rank,
but I disagree.

47:21.461 --> 47:24.498
Each piece is as powerful,
or as weak,

47:25.432 --> 47:27.468
as the circumstance
it finds itself in.

47:27.901 --> 47:30.836
At the beginning of the game,
they are all equal

47:30.838 --> 47:33.408
and depending on
the strategy used,

47:33.840 --> 47:36.377
the positioning,
the circumstances of the play,

47:36.977 --> 47:39.748
any piece could be the weakest.

47:40.713 --> 47:43.617
Or any piece
could be the most powerful.

48:25.025 --> 48:26.126
I like your hat.

48:27.093 --> 48:28.128
Really?

48:29.829 --> 48:30.664
Give it to me.

48:31.898 --> 48:32.865
You want it?

48:32.867 --> 48:33.568
Mm-hm.

48:36.169 --> 48:37.169
All right.

48:42.242 --> 48:43.809
- You know what?
- Hm?

48:43.811 --> 48:45.077
It looks better on you.

48:45.079 --> 48:46.613
It really does.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.715
You know, um...

48:49.916 --> 48:51.084
I have a surprise for you.

48:53.119 --> 48:54.586
Turn around.

48:56.122 --> 48:57.525
Close your eyes.

48:57.858 --> 48:58.959
I won't look.

48:59.994 --> 49:01.996
Maybe get started
on that belt buckle for me, huh?

49:03.030 --> 49:04.698
Don't gotta tell me twice.

50:07.894 --> 50:08.829
<i>Doctor, I have Amy for you.</i>

50:09.195 --> 50:10.130
Thank you.

50:11.197 --> 50:12.299
Hello, Amy.

50:15.235 --> 50:17.104
Well,
it's your last day with us.

50:18.005 --> 50:18.706
Yeah.

50:19.372 --> 50:20.575
How do you feel about that?

50:21.874 --> 50:23.610
Um, a little scared.

50:25.178 --> 50:26.046
Four years is...

50:27.715 --> 50:29.918
a long time
to be away from everyone.

50:31.651 --> 50:32.954
I feel like I've changed a lot.

50:33.921 --> 50:35.256
I'm hoping outside
has changed, too.

50:36.023 --> 50:38.191
You have. It has.

50:39.059 --> 50:41.996
We've all come a very long way,
you especially.

50:42.229 --> 50:43.131
Thank you.

50:43.764 --> 50:45.265
We've made fantastic progress.

50:46.032 --> 50:49.303
Although, there have been
some incidents.

50:50.738 --> 50:51.973
And the nightmares.

50:53.706 --> 50:54.875
Are you still having
the nightmares?

50:55.776 --> 50:57.211
- Um...
- The demon?

50:58.845 --> 50:59.680
Aka Manah.

53:02.468 --> 53:03.403
What is it?

53:04.271 --> 53:05.336
Doctor, Mrs. Hunter is here.

53:05.338 --> 53:07.905
Could you tell her
we'll be with her in a moment?

53:07.907 --> 53:08.939
Yes, Doctor.

53:08.941 --> 53:10.343
Amy...

53:11.878 --> 53:15.079
I'd like for you to consider remaining
in some programs here at Fairview.

53:15.081 --> 53:16.416
I have to be frank with you,

53:17.284 --> 53:21.186
I am worried that your episodes
may turn dangerous

53:21.188 --> 53:23.925
if you are not
in a controlled environment.

53:24.457 --> 53:26.026
I have to stay here?

53:26.425 --> 53:28.126
No. No, no.

53:28.128 --> 53:30.262
No one is trying
to force you to stay here.

53:30.264 --> 53:33.097
I am simply talking about
a day treatment program.

53:33.099 --> 53:33.800
No.

53:34.834 --> 53:36.470
God, if I don't have to...

53:37.403 --> 53:39.072
and I mean, have to stay here...

53:40.474 --> 53:42.043
I'd really like to go back.

53:42.543 --> 53:43.811
Oh my God.

53:46.380 --> 53:48.782
I had no idea
it had gotten so bad.

53:49.383 --> 53:52.419
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Do you not
remember about Dave's funeral?

53:53.320 --> 53:55.086
What a horrible thing to say,
Ethan.

53:55.088 --> 53:56.323
Yeah,
it's the concussion talking.

53:58.291 --> 53:59.159
Oh.

54:00.193 --> 54:01.262
Oh, are we okay?

54:02.262 --> 54:03.562
The pills should put her out
for the night..

54:03.564 --> 54:05.133
Janie, it's a heartbreak.

54:05.898 --> 54:07.899
I don't think I could do it.

54:07.901 --> 54:10.238
Jane, you've got
the patience of a saint.

54:11.537 --> 54:13.905
So, the girl...

54:13.907 --> 54:15.510
She'll be asleep soon.

54:16.209 --> 54:18.876
Good, good. Sleep is good.

54:18.878 --> 54:23.048
To wit, if there's nothing else,
I would like to retire.

54:23.050 --> 54:24.416
Thank you so much
for everything, Nik.

54:24.418 --> 54:25.883
You're a prince.

54:25.885 --> 54:27.218
And you're a very nice lady.

54:27.220 --> 54:29.890
So, breakfast in the morning,
seven to nine?

54:30.523 --> 54:31.892
Goodnight, everybody.

54:39.465 --> 54:42.836
Here... is just a white pawn,
right?

54:45.005 --> 54:45.872
No.

54:47.441 --> 54:48.943
Just a white pawn

54:49.642 --> 54:52.345
until he becomes,

54:52.945 --> 54:53.980
the white pawn.

54:54.914 --> 54:56.481
And he clashes.

54:56.483 --> 54:58.617
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

54:58.619 --> 55:00.854
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:01.255 --> 55:02.921
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:02.923 --> 55:04.455
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:04.457 --> 55:06.925
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:06.927 --> 55:08.095
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:08.427 --> 55:10.495
<i>I shall raise my sword</i>

55:10.497 --> 55:12.963
<i>In defense of my queen
Clash, clash</i>

55:12.965 --> 55:14.932
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:14.934 --> 55:16.267
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:16.269 --> 55:18.269
<i>I shall raise my shield</i>

55:18.271 --> 55:20.638
<i>To protect my king
Clash, clash</i>

55:20.640 --> 55:22.606
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:22.608 --> 55:24.110
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:24.343 --> 55:27.178
<i>I shall die honorably in battle</i>

55:27.180 --> 55:28.178
<i>I will, clash, clash</i>

55:28.180 --> 55:30.381
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:30.383 --> 55:31.749
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:31.751 --> 55:36.287
<i>I'll be the first to die
If to die I must, clash, clash</i>

55:36.289 --> 55:38.555
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

55:38.557 --> 55:40.961
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

55:43.229 --> 55:44.865
I am the white pawn,
clash, clash.

55:53.139 --> 55:55.606
That chess set has
always creeped me out, Ethan.

55:55.608 --> 55:57.477
Well, maybe that's
what I like about it, Jane.

55:58.110 --> 55:59.579
I'm going out to the gazebo.

56:00.280 --> 56:01.445
To get stoned.

56:01.447 --> 56:03.113
Yeah, to get stoned.
What the hell?

56:03.115 --> 56:04.918
Why don't you have
another fucking drink, Eva?

56:06.052 --> 56:07.188
I'll be right back.

56:08.488 --> 56:10.124
I thought he'd never leave.

56:10.456 --> 56:13.191
Hey, be happy that you have
someone to annoy you.

56:13.193 --> 56:15.296
Like I need a hole in the head.

56:19.633 --> 56:20.668
All right.

56:23.269 --> 56:25.538
No, I shouldn't. Amy's a mess.

56:26.539 --> 56:28.942
That's an argument for,
not against.

56:29.443 --> 56:30.311
Go on.

56:40.086 --> 56:41.454
My God, Eva, keep drinking.

56:42.488 --> 56:44.257
Just drink yourself
to death, please.

56:55.135 --> 56:56.070
Yeah.

56:57.403 --> 56:58.072
Oh.

57:04.443 --> 57:05.679
Fucking animals.

57:06.613 --> 57:07.948
God, I hate this place.

57:08.615 --> 57:09.684
I need to piss.

57:12.019 --> 57:14.084
Eva...

57:14.086 --> 57:15.222
Come here.

57:15.488 --> 57:16.691
I got something for you.

57:30.403 --> 57:32.070
I think I'll join you, son.

57:36.610 --> 57:37.244
Who are you?

57:41.381 --> 57:42.383
Ah.

58:13.079 --> 58:14.314
Have a good night, son.

58:19.251 --> 58:21.087
<i>I've been waiting for so long</i>

58:21.655 --> 58:23.153
<i>Time again</i>

58:23.155 --> 58:27.093
<i>Time and time again</i>

58:38.505 --> 58:42.276
<i>It's when I want you so bad</i>

58:45.345 --> 58:47.879
I mean, especially at my age,
I mean...

58:47.881 --> 58:50.217
Who the hell is that
at this time of night?

58:50.749 --> 58:51.816
- What?
- What?

58:51.818 --> 58:53.117
Ladies.

58:54.488 --> 58:56.756
I'm sorry,
I hope I didn't startle you.

58:57.756 --> 58:59.657
Evening, ma'am.

58:59.659 --> 59:02.827
I got a car downstairs that's
full of buckshot and water,

59:02.829 --> 59:05.262
and some deer piss.

59:05.264 --> 59:09.803
And, well, I need my brothers to help
me unload it into the pickup truck,

59:10.369 --> 59:13.239
but, uh, they don't seem
to be answering their god...

59:14.240 --> 59:16.409
Their phones. Um...

59:16.642 --> 59:19.345
So, without sounding rude, um...

59:19.778 --> 59:22.349
have y'all seen my dumbass
brothers anywhere?

59:22.615 --> 59:25.285
We haven't seen them
since dinner with you.

59:25.918 --> 59:27.484
Would you like some wine?

59:27.486 --> 59:28.222
Hm.

59:29.756 --> 59:30.791
Yes.

59:33.526 --> 59:35.693
Nah, I'd better not.

59:35.695 --> 59:37.495
Uh, I... I'm gonna go upstairs

59:37.497 --> 59:40.765
and check to see where Tweedledee
and Tweedledumbass are,

59:40.767 --> 59:42.535
but y'all ladies
have a good evening,

59:43.637 --> 59:47.475
and maybe a raincheck,
or something like that.

59:48.207 --> 59:49.274
I'll wait. It's all right.

59:50.910 --> 59:53.347
Yes, thank you very much.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.550
<i>I used to spend my nights out
In the barroom</i>

59:59.251 --> 01:00:02.187
<i>Brought me back</i>

01:00:02.189 --> 01:00:06.127
<i>From being too far gone</i>

01:00:15.235 --> 01:00:16.871
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:00:17.604 --> 01:00:18.739
Where the fuck is Blair?

01:00:19.706 --> 01:00:22.709
Shit. Shit, that fucking hick.

01:00:26.746 --> 01:00:28.182
Darsaw!

01:00:29.682 --> 01:00:31.349
Goddamn numbhead.

01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:33.253
Fucking stupid asses.

01:00:34.887 --> 01:00:36.156
Darsaw!

01:00:39.892 --> 01:00:41.161
Ole!

01:00:41.927 --> 01:00:43.163
The fuck you at, man?

01:00:43.863 --> 01:00:44.899
Goobers!

01:00:52.372 --> 01:00:54.675
You guys better stop...
fucking around.

01:01:01.381 --> 01:01:02.683
She didn't even unpack.

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:04.251
That's not like her.

01:01:05.418 --> 01:01:08.586
Okay, then he put his hand
up my skirt and he yelled...

01:01:08.588 --> 01:01:09.490
Here, come here.

01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:16.861
What the fuck
does that even mean?

01:01:16.863 --> 01:01:18.365
I have no fucking idea,

01:01:18.664 --> 01:01:20.934
but whenever he did it,
I just nearly came.

01:01:22.269 --> 01:01:24.334
- Our baby!
- Hey.

01:01:24.336 --> 01:01:26.303
- Hey, so beautiful and grown.
- Hey.

01:01:26.305 --> 01:01:27.905
Why are you out of bed?
You feeling better?

01:01:27.907 --> 01:01:30.707
Yeah, Mom, have you seen Blair
come through here at all?

01:01:30.709 --> 01:01:32.644
- No, not since dinner, why?
- Yeah, why?

01:01:32.646 --> 01:01:33.546
Um...

01:01:34.447 --> 01:01:36.416
Because she has
my cell phone charger,

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:38.850
and, uh, my-my battery's dead.

01:01:38.852 --> 01:01:41.686
There's no network out here,
and I'm dying, so...

01:01:41.688 --> 01:01:43.553
- Well, I would check upstairs...
- Yes.

01:01:43.555 --> 01:01:45.892
- ...or the local nightclubs.
- Definitely.

01:01:46.593 --> 01:01:48.593
- Did you see your dad out there?
- Nope. No, Ma.

01:01:48.595 --> 01:01:50.564
Come on, Amy. Gotta go. Okay.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.664
Mmm, it's just like
when we were kids.

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.302
Um-hm.

01:01:55.535 --> 01:01:57.271
- Do you have any more wine?
- Um-hm.

01:02:33.372 --> 01:02:34.307
Blair!

01:02:35.407 --> 01:02:37.443
Blair, what the fuck?

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:41.748
Blair!

01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:43.784
Blair!

01:02:53.593 --> 01:02:55.629
This is, this is...

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:05.005
She-she's not answering
her phone.

01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:09.009
Well, shit...

01:03:09.976 --> 01:03:12.510
I thought we would have caught
her bawling her brains out

01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:15.015
in some redneck threesome
free-for-all.

01:03:15.548 --> 01:03:17.584
- No such luck, huh?
- No. No luck.

01:03:17.816 --> 01:03:19.652
I-I think we better get
the 'rents involved.

01:03:20.653 --> 01:03:23.086
One... One of those cult freaks
could've made off with her,

01:03:23.088 --> 01:03:25.823
or she could've hitched a ride
with that cotton candy vendor.

01:03:25.825 --> 01:03:28.126
I think he... was cute.

01:03:28.128 --> 01:03:29.727
I think the True Believers
were good.

01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:31.765
I mean, they were nice people.

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:33.865
Yeah, oh, they're nice.

01:03:33.867 --> 01:03:35.767
Yeah, that's how they get you
to join their cult.

01:03:35.769 --> 01:03:37.869
Next thing you know,
you're shaving your head

01:03:37.871 --> 01:03:39.706
and your selling flowers
at a fucking airport. Come on.

01:03:58.157 --> 01:03:59.892
Amy, take your time.

01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:02.428
And don't be in a hurry to take
your finger off of the piece.

01:04:02.729 --> 01:04:05.765
Okay,
I think I got it this time.

01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:08.702
So, make your move.

01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:14.807
Bishop to queen's bishop three.

01:04:15.941 --> 01:04:18.044
- Check.
- Very good.

01:04:19.546 --> 01:04:22.549
You know, I can still take
your bishop with my rook.

01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:25.386
Maybe.

01:04:27.486 --> 01:04:28.555
Okay then...

01:04:29.488 --> 01:04:30.624
rook takes bishop.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.095
Queen to queen's knight five.

01:04:38.097 --> 01:04:40.231
Checkmate.

01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:41.901
Oh, son of a bitch, Amy.

01:04:42.101 --> 01:04:43.470
I finally got you.

01:04:44.236 --> 01:04:45.405
Three moves ahead.

01:04:46.539 --> 01:04:47.573
Nicely done.

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:50.240
Thanks.

01:05:12.197 --> 01:05:13.466
Sorry.

01:05:14.733 --> 01:05:16.666
I didn't mean to startle you,
just looking for my brothers.

01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:18.001
- Have you seen them?
- Um-mm.

01:05:18.003 --> 01:05:20.039
I'm sorry.
I just took a nap and woke up.

01:05:20.807 --> 01:05:23.577
And these two here got
stone fucking drunk. -Mom?

01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:24.844
God...

01:05:25.544 --> 01:05:26.780
We need to find Trevor.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.615
All right, I'll come with you.
I've got a flashlight in the car.

01:05:37.155 --> 01:05:38.224
Ole!

01:05:39.258 --> 01:05:40.059
God damn it.

01:05:42.061 --> 01:05:43.095
Darsaw!

01:05:45.999 --> 01:05:47.067
Oh my God.

01:05:49.769 --> 01:05:50.671
Is that real?

01:05:51.938 --> 01:05:53.140
Man, that's fucking real.

01:06:03.782 --> 01:06:06.249
- <i>We're sorry...</i>
- What the fuck?

01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:08.488
<i>...you have reached a number that has
been disconnected...</i> -You kidding me?

01:06:08.988 --> 01:06:09.656
Fuck!

01:06:13.959 --> 01:06:15.928
I remember seeing
a landline inside, all right?

01:06:16.162 --> 01:06:17.497
Come on,
let's go see if that one works.

01:06:22.334 --> 01:06:23.269
Come on.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.510
God damn it, Darsaw.

01:06:32.044 --> 01:06:34.014
Come on, we need to go find
"Thelma and Louise."

01:06:36.648 --> 01:06:38.249
Go see if you can find the
phone somewhere. -Okay.

01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:39.919
I think I see it over there
near the window.

01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:43.590
Ma'am? Ma'am, wake up.
Ma'am, please.

01:06:43.822 --> 01:06:44.690
Ma'am?

01:06:46.224 --> 01:06:47.727
Ma'am?

01:06:48.227 --> 01:06:50.193
Call 911, Amy!

01:06:50.195 --> 01:06:51.028
Call the police!

01:06:54.733 --> 01:06:56.267
The phone, is it working or not?

01:06:58.303 --> 01:06:59.539
Fuck!

01:07:13.119 --> 01:07:14.887
Stop! Stop!

01:08:08.675 --> 01:08:09.843
Ah.

01:08:10.809 --> 01:08:14.014
The omnipotent, noble knight.

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:23.988
I shall mount
my mighty barbed steed

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.727
and take great lengths
upon this land,

01:08:27.225 --> 01:08:30.225
paired with my bishop
in defense.

01:08:30.228 --> 01:08:33.698
Serve upon this war, its end.

01:09:05.397 --> 01:09:06.666
Happy birthday.

01:09:34.861 --> 01:09:35.961
Make a wish.

01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:43.370
I wish this would end.

01:09:51.477 --> 01:09:52.446
Where's my mom?

01:09:53.845 --> 01:09:55.482
Why, right there, of course.

01:09:57.215 --> 01:09:59.186
Who's that?
Where's my mom? Where's she?

01:10:00.318 --> 01:10:01.921
Follow the bread crumbs.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.335
Now, the bishop...

01:10:49.402 --> 01:10:51.138
a wily soldier,

01:10:51.469 --> 01:10:53.173
but an honorable man.

01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:58.445
And I shall preach
the good word, sire,

01:10:59.178 --> 01:11:01.448
and bring our enemies
to God's fire.

01:11:01.914 --> 01:11:04.550
Pray for their souls
upon the hour

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.954
as death's dragon doth devour.

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:48.260
The kingdom, Niklaus,
the kingdom.

01:11:48.527 --> 01:11:51.127
You must defend the kingdom.

01:11:51.129 --> 01:11:52.832
- The kingdom?
- The kingdom.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.003
These pieces, these soldiers...

01:11:58.237 --> 01:12:01.541
They're your only defense
of the kingdom.

01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:04.077
- The kingdom.
- The kingdom.

01:12:05.978 --> 01:12:07.881
- The kingdom.
- The kingdom.

01:12:08.414 --> 01:12:09.448
The kingdom.

01:12:16.088 --> 01:12:16.923
The kingdom.

01:13:28.728 --> 01:13:30.727
Mama! Oh, my God!

01:13:30.729 --> 01:13:33.633
I'm so sorry. Okay, Mom.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:48.078
- Hello, Amy.
- No!

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.346
- Did you like my gift?
- Let my mom go!

01:13:50.348 --> 01:13:51.748
Yeah, about that...

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:54.618
Jane, we're not going
to be needing you anymore.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.488
No, I'm sorry,
the king has sacrificed you

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.323
so that we could put
our queen back on the board.

01:13:59.325 --> 01:14:00.391
No.

01:14:00.393 --> 01:14:03.063
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:14:03.329 --> 01:14:06.032
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:14:06.799 --> 01:14:11.101
<i>Happy birthday, dear daughter</i>

01:14:11.103 --> 01:14:12.138
Stop!

01:14:12.504 --> 01:14:14.673
Oh, Amy, you're being silly.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.074
Yes, yes. Do you not understand?

01:14:18.076 --> 01:14:20.347
I'm your daddy. It's true.

01:14:21.112 --> 01:14:23.983
Your mother was my cousin,
the beautiful Elizabeth Rosen.

01:14:25.116 --> 01:14:26.583
- No!
- Listen to me,

01:14:26.585 --> 01:14:31.524
I knew the moment I saw you,
that you were my Amy Anders.

01:14:32.058 --> 01:14:33.593
My father made us give you up.

01:14:34.093 --> 01:14:36.496
But now you're back.
Now we can win.

01:14:41.599 --> 01:14:42.602
You're Aka Manah.

01:14:44.737 --> 01:14:46.306
- You killed them all.
- Amy...

01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:48.739
They were just game pieces.

01:14:48.741 --> 01:14:53.113
This is the game of kings.
Do you not understand?

01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:06.222
<i>I am the white pawn
Clash, clash</i>

01:15:06.224 --> 01:15:08.061
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

01:15:08.527 --> 01:15:10.360

01:15:18.838 --> 01:15:20.471
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

01:15:20.473 --> 01:15:22.573
<i>I shall raise my sword</i>

01:15:22.575 --> 01:15:24.874
<i>In defense of my queen

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.885
<i>Clash, clash I am the

01:15:34.887 --> 01:15:36.453
<i>I am the white pawn</i>

01:15:36.455 --> 01:15:39.489
<i>I shall die honorably in battle</i>

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.391
<i>I will, clash, clash</i>

01:15:41.393 --> 01:15:43.127

01:15:43.129 --> 01:15:44.494

<i>I'll be the first to die

01:15:49.902 --> 01:15:52.572
<i>I am the white pawn

01:15:54.272 --> 01:15:55.571
You killed Trevor.

01:15:55.573 --> 01:15:57.343
No, not true.

01:15:57.742 --> 01:15:59.079
That was your demon.

01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:01.680
He made me.

01:16:03.115 --> 01:16:05.518
I was just his puppet, and you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

01:16:05.817 --> 01:16:07.820
And you know what else?
He's gonna make you do it, too.

01:16:11.357 --> 01:16:12.258
No.

01:16:12.525 --> 01:16:15.094
Amy, Amy, Amy...

01:16:16.362 --> 01:16:19.296
Listen to me very carefully...

01:16:19.298 --> 01:16:21.201
You're not my father!

01:16:21.467 --> 01:16:24.737
You are a beautiful
monarch butterfly...

01:16:28.339 --> 01:16:30.476
...emerging from the cocoon.

01:16:33.245 --> 01:16:34.680
Preparing to take flight...

01:16:35.813 --> 01:16:36.682
<i>and be free.</i>

01:16:44.356 --> 01:16:46.893
Queen to queen's knight three.

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:50.829
Remove now, the black queen
from the board.

01:17:08.479 --> 01:17:10.482
Good daughter.

01:17:11.482 --> 01:17:13.352
Now, come here...

01:17:13.952 --> 01:17:16.388
and give Papa a big hug.

01:21:03.816 --> 01:21:05.684
Hello, Reverend Thomas.
It's Amy Anders.

01:21:07.518 --> 01:21:08.754
It's actually Anders now.

01:21:10.356 --> 01:21:12.756
My mom left me here to recover, and Nik
had to leave town for a little while

01:21:12.758 --> 01:21:14.490
and take care of family
down south.

01:21:14.492 --> 01:21:15.527
And he left me in charge, and...

01:21:21.098 --> 01:21:23.800
I thought, you know, we could
use a lot of help around here,

01:21:23.802 --> 01:21:25.571
and maybe we could
work something out?

01:21:37.014 --> 01:21:37.883
Great.

01:21:39.183 --> 01:21:40.519
I look forward to it.
