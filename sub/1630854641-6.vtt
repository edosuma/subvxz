WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.567
Previously on
Bering Sea Gold.

00:06.166 --> 00:08.467
Been out here almost
half of my life,

00:08.467 --> 00:11.100
working to get where I'm at.

00:12.567 --> 00:16.133
Not to have Kris Kelly
come and [bleep] it up.

00:16.133 --> 00:19.967
But he's got to come and sit
on top of us every trip out.

00:19.967 --> 00:22.233
I've had it up to here
with Kris Kelly.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.934
We're not leaving this spot.

00:25.934 --> 00:27.533
We're gonna have
to fight for it.

00:28.967 --> 00:30.700
They think
this is their ocean.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.734
I don't think so.
I'm here to stay.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.634
We will not be stopped.

00:35.634 --> 00:37.867
Make that gold.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.533
Kris Kelly is about ready
to get his ass kicked.

00:40.533 --> 00:42.934
I'm gonna go wait
for him at the dock tonight.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.634
Get the [bleep] away from me.

00:48.634 --> 00:50.467
Go.

00:52.767 --> 00:54.266
Yeah! Come on.

00:54.266 --> 00:55.500
Coward.

00:55.500 --> 01:02.900
Come on, Andy.
Get in there and rush him.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.934
Now you better get
the [bleep] away.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.333
911,
what's your emergency?

01:27.333 --> 01:29.634
Andy Kelly just punched me.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.800
Hello.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.300
My brother was just attacked
at the harbor.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.333
We need a police officer.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.700
Yep.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.800
My name is Kristopher Kelly.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.333
Thank you very much.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.500
He came down here
to cause problems.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.066
Start [bleep] violence.

01:49.066 --> 01:52.166
You know, like, all he did
was he's been on that
ocean plaguing me.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.066
Everywhere I go,
he comes in--

01:54.066 --> 01:55.634
Dude, I was coming down.

01:55.634 --> 01:58.667
He looked at me, he goes,
"Andy, if you do that again,
I'm going to call it.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.266
You're gonna go to jail."

02:00.266 --> 02:02.467
And I was just like,
"Man, [bleep] off, dude.
I have nothing to say to you."

02:02.467 --> 02:04.333
That's all he keeps
threatening me
with the police.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.000
He came down here
to start some trouble.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.233
Well, he got some trouble.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.934
I know it looks like
I'm calling the cops on him,

02:10.934 --> 02:12.834
but this is how it works
in business.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.967
You got to be the first
to call just in case

02:14.967 --> 02:17.367
the other guy is trying
to press charges on you.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.767
I don't need the police.
I'm doing fine right now.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.166
But I'm not going to let
myself be pushed around.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.133
Did a great job.
You did everything good.

02:24.133 --> 02:26.800
I love you, buddy. I love you.
Give me some love, buddy.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.900
Love my brother, baby.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.600
Dude, I dropped him
with my left hand.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.834
- I know, man.
- You looked good doing it to.

02:37.834 --> 02:40.800
I was waiting at the dock,
I was gonna talk to Kris.

02:41.834 --> 02:44.200
And Andy come down
got in my face.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.400
So I pushed him back.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.967
And the he [bleep] punched me.

02:48.066 --> 02:49.600
He did?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.300
Then he sucker punched me.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.467
No way.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.700
Bleed [bleep].

02:55.700 --> 02:56.800
You did?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.634
Yeah, his nose is [bleep].

03:01.166 --> 03:03.400
I just wanted to talk
to that whiny little [bleep].

03:03.400 --> 03:06.734
His fat ass brother shows up
and starts throwing
his weight around.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.800
I'm gonna call the cops.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.200
But if they're not going
to press charges,
we'll handle it our own way.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.400
I'm about to go meet the cops
at the house

03:17.400 --> 03:19.634
because I know
if I didn't call them,

03:19.634 --> 03:23.066
they would [bleep] story
would be 100% different.

03:29.233 --> 03:32.333
Well, I'll [bleep] that
one of these days.

03:56.934 --> 04:01.333
If Kris has all these idiots
over here doing nothing,
then I want two of them.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.500
Two idiots.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.100
Everybody here
should have two idiots.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.033
After the previous
day's fireworks,

04:07.033 --> 04:11.233
the Kelly clan looks
to get back to the business
of getting gold.

04:11.233 --> 04:13.367
Dude, why don't you ever
go up and around?

04:17.300 --> 04:20.467
I don't think
Shawn's gonna be
messing with us for a while.

04:20.467 --> 04:21.600
We got to keep mining.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.700
We owe a ton of money
in just less than a few weeks.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.634
So now we're gonna launch
the new Reaper.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.433
It still needs new pontoons
under the boat
to help it float better.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.500
Now we need a trailer
to pull my boat out

04:32.500 --> 04:34.667
so we can do the installations
of the pontoon.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.700
So we're gonna hit up
our old buddy Vernon,
see if we can borrow his.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.233
Hey.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.634
My man, Brad.

04:43.634 --> 04:44.834
Hey, Vernon.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.333
What's up there?

04:58.967 --> 05:03.266
In gold mining, the credo
is you always help out
a fellow miner.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.600
It's a karma thing.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.433
You'd want them
to help you out too
if you needed it one day.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.400
And I believe in that.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.233
But when it comes
to the Kellys,

05:11.233 --> 05:15.533
it gives me pause
because it's unlikely
they'll ever pay it forward.

05:15.533 --> 05:18.266
And you usually end up
taking it in the shorts.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.066
You want to use it?

05:20.066 --> 05:22.100
Yeah. Like, 40 minutes.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.000
Just we're not even
taking it past this dock.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.967
We're just going
to pull it here,
pull the boat on,

05:25.967 --> 05:27.467
put the pontoons underneath,
drop it back.

05:27.467 --> 05:28.767
All right. Okay. All right.

05:28.767 --> 05:32.433
Out of my place,
there's a double axle
pontoon boat trailer.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.133
- Okay.
- You can use that one.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.033
- Bring it back in one piece.
- I will.

05:36.033 --> 05:40.300
It's a $3,500 trailer,

05:40.300 --> 05:42.600
It's over there by my crawler.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.333
Man,
you got a lot of junk.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.600
That junk? I mean,
now you're calling it junk.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.500
Not that... not that,
but I'm saying that crawler,
that crawler thing is [bleep].

05:50.500 --> 05:52.000
I mean, when you want
to borrow

05:52.000 --> 05:54.033
all of a sudden
it ain't junk.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.767
All right, well,
we got to roll.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.433
- Get out of here.
- Hey, don't work too hard.

05:57.433 --> 05:58.867
Anyway, have a good day, Vernon.

05:58.867 --> 06:00.166
Thanks.

06:01.967 --> 06:04.433
I'll be lucky if I ever see
that trailer again.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.934
I may live to regret this,
but honestly,

06:12.934 --> 06:15.767
it's pretty hard
to break a trailer.

06:15.767 --> 06:19.266
I mean, they'd have
to put in some serious
effort to pull that off?

06:20.967 --> 06:22.533
Okay. Come on down.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.533
You want to go left,
come back.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.166
Straight back.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.400
Come on.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.400
Okay. Here we go.

06:56.066 --> 06:57.333
Back it a little.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.166
- How we looking?
- Right there.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.367
Bring it forward.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.734
We've got to pull the boat
out of the water,

07:12.734 --> 07:14.934
put the new pontoons up
underneath the front end,

07:14.934 --> 07:17.066
get it back in the water
as soon as possible.

07:17.066 --> 07:18.567
Really pretty simple.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.333
Pull it straight up.

07:38.934 --> 07:41.533
The [bleep] tires,
dude, are under.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.033
Yeah, both tires on this side.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.300
And then the one
on the back on that side.

07:50.634 --> 07:54.133
Poor Vernon
gonna be pissed again.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.400
The Kelly's [bleep] up
my trailer.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.967
I can just hear him
screaming already.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.600
He possibly could have
a heart attack, you know?

08:15.667 --> 08:17.333
Oh, here's Vernon. Oh, no.

08:34.467 --> 08:37.900
Well, I thought it was
pretty much impossible
to [bleep] up that trailer.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.333
I guess I was wrong.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.433
All we did was pull it out
of the water.

08:43.533 --> 08:45.333
That's all we did.

08:49.233 --> 08:52.533
It's not... it's not centered
on the trailer.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.367
All the weight is back here
on the axle end of the trail.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.634
Oh, I know.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.667
That's a $3,500 trailer.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.233
I mean...

09:12.233 --> 09:13.734
I mean, come on, you don't...

09:13.734 --> 09:17.100
look at that, it's tail heavy
like a son of a bitch.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.767
A dead giveaway at the way
that damn red truck

09:19.767 --> 09:21.066
is jerked up in the air.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.667
I couldn't see
the front, Vernon.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.000
The way
they were pulling me up,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.500
I couldn't see the front,
you know?

09:26.500 --> 09:27.734
Then they drove--

09:27.734 --> 09:31.533
Who in the [bleep] damn hell
loads up a trailer like this?

09:33.066 --> 09:35.834
Get that boat off my trailer.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.467
Don't move it another inch.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.967
I don't propose

09:40.967 --> 09:43.533
That's up to you.
Just get it off my trailer.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.934
You know, I tried
to do you a favor, Brad.

09:52.667 --> 09:57.667
Well, you can tell the damn
truck over there is jacked up
in the back end.

09:57.667 --> 10:00.800
That tells you that
that thing is ass heavy.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.867
All right.

10:05.867 --> 10:09.400
Anybody with a lick
of sense knows not to load

10:09.400 --> 10:11.934
a trailer tail heavy
like that.

10:11.934 --> 10:15.233
You're supposed to center
the damn boat on the trailer.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.767
This is [bleep] idiotic.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.734
But since the trailer
doesn't belong to them,

10:23.734 --> 10:25.967
do they really give a [bleep]?

10:25.967 --> 10:28.200
I don't know
why I even keep falling

10:28.200 --> 10:30.667
into the trap of trying
to help them out.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.967
But that's it. That's it.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.433
I'm never gonna help those
sons of bitches out again.

10:35.433 --> 10:37.500
Total disrespect
for my equipment

10:37.500 --> 10:40.400
and total disrespect for me.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.333
That's what you call
sorry ass people.

10:57.133 --> 11:00.233
Well, yesterday
was a very interesting day.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.266
This is not over by far.

11:02.266 --> 11:05.934
Andy Kelly, you're gonna
get your ass kicked

11:05.934 --> 11:07.600
really good this time.

11:09.900 --> 11:14.533
Sucker punch, sucker,
weasel ass, can't fight fair.

11:14.533 --> 11:17.967
I'm gonna make sure
you don't ever
with me again.

11:17.967 --> 11:20.567
The day
after the fights heard
around Nome,

11:20.567 --> 11:24.200
Shawn Pomrenke
still has Kellys on the brain.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.800
with the wrong guy.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.166
The guys think they can come
in here and [bleep] around

11:33.166 --> 11:35.033
and do whatever they want?

11:35.033 --> 11:37.367
No, it's not how it works.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.634
You're in my [bleep] town.

11:39.634 --> 11:41.767
Better respect the people
and respect

11:41.767 --> 11:44.233
what everybody does
and how hard they've worked

11:44.233 --> 11:46.000
to get where they're at.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.100
That's their problem.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.367
They don't have no respect
for anybody,

11:49.367 --> 11:51.233
but they're gonna
start respecting.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.867
There's been a lot of people
in town wanting somebody

11:56.867 --> 11:59.033
to punch Andy Kelly
in the face.

11:59.033 --> 12:01.967
You know you're welcome.
I'm here for you people.

12:05.567 --> 12:09.033
I think I showed the Kellys
I'm not about to back down
in a fight.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.834
But the truth is,
it's throwing me off my game.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.066
I'm aiming for 3,000 ounces,
and I'm way behind.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.667
Bad weather,
equipment problems,
The Mistress.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.000
There's so many things
been slowing me down.

12:31.266 --> 12:34.800
I just have to regroup
and remember
what it's really all about.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.700
There's an area back here
that I've been wanting to work
for a long time.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.367
Haven't got in there.

12:40.367 --> 12:43.934
There's a bunch of sand,
but I believe under that sand,
there's a bunch of gold.

12:43.934 --> 12:47.934
So we're gonna go ahead,
spot up,
fly back in over there.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.800
And just start moving
some dirt.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.967
While Shawn
gets cracking...

13:26.000 --> 13:27.634
Good morning, everybody.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.767
Kris Kelly's
raring to go.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.300
I was like, "Yeah!"

13:41.333 --> 13:44.700
But The Mistress,
not so much.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.634
Don, do you think
this is going to be

13:48.634 --> 13:51.333
the last time we have
to [bleep] the injectors?

13:55.934 --> 13:57.800
So the excavator's
messed up again.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.166
Surprise, surprise.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.433
I swear we finally
had a big step forward

14:01.433 --> 14:03.734
yesterday on gold,
everything going great.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.667
And now here we are again.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.667
Today, it's the fuel injector.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.333
What [bleep] is going on?

14:22.867 --> 14:24.600
Things could be better.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.533
Seems like it's been
a huge struggle
all [bleep] season.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.033
And I struggle every season.

14:30.033 --> 14:34.233
But this season
has been just a nightmare.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.700
I knew we were gonna
have to fight
for everything this year.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.033
Just that I didn't think
we were gonna have
to fight so much.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.567
You know, not every
day anyways.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.767
When I took on an excavation
barge this summer,

14:45.767 --> 14:47.133
I thought it would be
just like Shawn.

14:47.133 --> 14:50.700
Huge gold, lots of hours,
no problems.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.500
Everything would be great.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.900
This thing's been
a huge pain in my ass,

14:54.900 --> 14:56.934
and we've only gotten
20 ounces so far.

14:56.934 --> 15:01.166
We need another 50 ounces
by the end of the month
or this all goes bye-bye.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.700
This is a lot tougher
than I ever imagined.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.834
Start it again.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.133
Okay, ready?

15:12.367 --> 15:14.200
So far, not good.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.900
She hasn't fired up yet,
but any minute now.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.700
Just going to talk
nice to her.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.767
Stupid excavator.

15:21.767 --> 15:22.934
- Don.
- What?

15:22.934 --> 15:24.533
Another crank.

15:24.533 --> 15:25.900
Yeah, try one more time.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.600
Okay. I'm gonna crank.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.700
Well, I thought
it was going to go there.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.934
So now The Mistress
is dead in the water.

15:40.934 --> 15:43.100
The new Reaper
hasn't even mined yet.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.467
And most of all, I have
a big problem with Shawn

15:45.467 --> 15:48.467
that's hanging over my head
that just won't go away.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.433
Yeah, we got some
good licks in last night,

15:50.433 --> 15:52.900
but this problem
is not going away easy.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.700
I don't know what's up
with Shawn this year

15:54.700 --> 15:57.333
'cause I'm shocked
Shawn's been doing
this all year, you know?

15:57.333 --> 15:58.467
Yeah.

15:58.467 --> 16:02.266
You know, like, dude,
leave us alone in our misery.

16:02.266 --> 16:04.367
We're like the kitten trying
to get out of a

16:04.367 --> 16:06.367
plastic bag
before they strangle.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.934
We don't need any help.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.200
We don't need
to be thrown in the river.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.166
- Creating conflict--
- I'm just glad nobody
went to jail.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.133
No dumb
about it, man.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.300
- That's what I'm happy about.
- Yeah.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.400
Well, he's going...

16:17.400 --> 16:19.100
Shawn's going around
right now telling everybody

16:19.100 --> 16:20.800
that Andy sucker
punched him and...

16:20.800 --> 16:22.467
- Yeah.
- ...started the whole thing.

16:22.467 --> 16:24.400
And, you know,
I'm like [bleep] him.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.000
Shawn hit Andy first twice.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.667
- He gave him a throat chop.
- Oh, wow.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.033
You know, and Andy's neck
is so huge,
good luck getting that...

16:32.033 --> 16:33.166
Chop him down.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.300
Where's the jugular?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.266
Good luck trying
to find that thing.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.600
You got to go through
four inches of padding.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.100
He's like a walrus
with the blubber
all over that [bleep].

16:42.100 --> 16:44.767
He doesn't even fit
in his dive suit anymore.

16:44.767 --> 16:47.033
You think you're going
to punch that guy's jugular?

16:48.700 --> 16:50.300
You know what?
I really didn't...

16:50.300 --> 16:52.867
I'm going to get
a lot of problems in town

16:52.867 --> 16:55.033
because of this
as time goes on.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.533
Watch. Yeah.

16:56.533 --> 16:59.100
This is too small of a town
to do [bleep] like that.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.667
Nobody wants
to be involved

17:00.667 --> 17:03.500
in this Shawn Pomrenke conflict.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.900
We live in this town.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.700
I don't even want
to be involved in it.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.400
And I didn't even do [bleep].

17:10.967 --> 17:12.400
Things are not good.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.300
Right now I've got Shawn
basically wanting to kill me
and my operation.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.533
And I've got a high priced,
barely used

17:18.533 --> 17:21.100
piece of [bleep] excavator
I just brought in.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.400
And all it's done is caused me
more expensive problems,

17:24.400 --> 17:26.367
and we're still not mining.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.734
So, Don, what's the diagnosis?

17:28.734 --> 17:30.500
I'm gonna name
this [bleep] Medusa.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.767
It's a [bleep] witch
to work on this thing.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.033
So what do you think
we should do?

17:53.667 --> 17:56.600
... I thought
this machine was going
to save my season.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.133
Should we bring
the boat back in?

17:59.133 --> 18:00.967
Or do you think
it'll be a big fix?

18:00.967 --> 18:03.967
Like, you know, like--

18:09.467 --> 18:10.934
Man!

18:10.934 --> 18:13.166
This [bleep] bad day
is turning worse.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.100
I just can't win right now.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.066
I don't know
why Shawn's all pissed off.

18:18.066 --> 18:20.767
All he has to do is let us
alone and we'll burn

18:20.767 --> 18:22.467
our own operation
to the ground.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.066
Back at the Myrtle.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.867
We're in the spot here.

18:41.533 --> 18:42.967
Here we go.

18:46.367 --> 18:47.900
It's time to make gold.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
This stuff looks amazing.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.233
Oh, yeah.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.500
Looking good.

19:02.233 --> 19:03.767
Make some damn money.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.433
Kris Kelly.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.100
I just got a text message

19:19.100 --> 19:23.533
from Kris Kelly saying
he's sorry.

19:25.967 --> 19:29.967
Being sorry and being an idiot
are two totally
different things.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.200
I tried to talk sense
into him for the last week

19:39.200 --> 19:41.066
and he wouldn't
listen.

19:41.066 --> 19:43.100
And then he thinks
his little brother Andy

19:43.100 --> 19:45.000
is going to protect him
from me.

19:46.400 --> 19:50.834
Well, I think he figured out
now that I ain't
scared of Andy.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.934
He's a big fat [bleep].

19:52.934 --> 19:55.200
I just wish
it didn't come to that.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.734
Doesn't need to be like that.

19:56.734 --> 20:00.066
But Kris and Andy Kelly's been
picking on people around

20:00.066 --> 20:02.000
this town
for the last ten years.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.667
I've had about enough of it.

20:05.667 --> 20:09.233
It's hard for me to hear Kris
say sorry and believe it.

20:09.233 --> 20:12.400
But truthfully, I need
this conflict behind me.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.266
It's messing with my season
and the bottom line.

20:17.266 --> 20:21.133
And if Kris is smart,
he needs this behind him too.

20:21.133 --> 20:24.066
Maybe it's time to find
a solution one way or another.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.634
One bucket after another.

20:30.634 --> 20:32.033
That's all that counts.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.967
Look at that
beautiful material.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.266
We're making gold.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.200
Shut it down! Shut it down!

20:59.834 --> 21:01.734
We got ourselves a problem.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.433
Slamming pretty hard.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.133
I know that evil sound.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.266
That's a problem
with the shaker.

21:10.266 --> 21:12.667
It's been giving us issues
all season long.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.100
This can't be good.

21:17.634 --> 21:20.934
We got a gap in between
our crown and our deck,

21:20.934 --> 21:25.500
and we need to get that down
to where it's gonna not flop around.

21:26.934 --> 21:30.233
As soon as we get in a groove,
something happens.

21:33.300 --> 21:36.166
Break it, fix it,
Break it, fix it.

21:38.734 --> 21:40.066
We're gonna
have to bring it in,

21:40.066 --> 21:42.900
get that crown
on the shaker dealt with.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.500
It shouldn't take long,
but we're done for now.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.300
Maybe while we're down,
it's time to meet with Kris
face to face.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.400
Now it's time
to fix some [bleep].

21:55.066 --> 21:56.734
Do not need this [bleep].

22:05.634 --> 22:06.967
It's like Groundhog Day.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.200
Time to make the donuts.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.200
Emily Riedel's
newest recruit is ready

22:13.200 --> 22:15.133
for her biggest
assignment yet.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.567
- More gold.
- More gold.

22:18.166 --> 22:22.233
You know, Jane's getting
more comfortable being
on the boat so.

22:22.233 --> 22:23.934
Get down there and get busy.

22:26.133 --> 22:29.900
I brought Jane up to meet
our goal of 250 ounces
this summer.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.567
And so far, so good.
We're making awesome headway.

22:32.567 --> 22:36.266
Last time we were out,
Jane took over Eroica
for a few hours on her own.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.567
And this time, it's going
to be the whole shift.

22:38.567 --> 22:43.533
My morning sickness is really
starting to kick in here,
so boat time is kind of off.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.934
So this is the...
this is the test.

22:45.934 --> 22:48.066
This is the final exam.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.200
Coming in hot.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.266
What the--

22:55.667 --> 22:57.233
I'm here for another day
of pending.

22:58.533 --> 22:59.800
I've been here a couple
of times now,

22:59.800 --> 23:02.066
if I'm more confident,
but still, like,
still learning.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.767
Really likes
to make a splash.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.100
- Do you copy?
- Yeah, I got you.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.867
How's it looking
down there, Rick?

23:41.367 --> 23:42.533
Copy that.

23:43.634 --> 23:45.567
Here we go. Whoa!

23:50.233 --> 23:52.066
Yum-yums!

23:56.567 --> 23:58.734
I'm just waiting right here
with bated breath.

24:09.367 --> 24:10.867
When he grunts,
it's because he's like

24:10.867 --> 24:14.333
throwing rocks over
and he, like, finds gold
underneath the rocks.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.934
It's like
his favorite thing to do.

24:15.934 --> 24:17.834
Sometimes he sounds like
Superman down there. Like...

24:20.066 --> 24:21.734
He says the rocks
are like this big.

24:21.734 --> 24:23.166
He's moving like boulders.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.300
Whoo!

24:31.300 --> 24:32.634
I'm really good at my whoos.

24:42.667 --> 24:43.767
Ooh.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.667
Oh, yeah.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.767
Roger that.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.567
Whoo! Oh, my God.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.066
The biggest one I've seen.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.900
So this is really cool to see.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.100
That's why we're here.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.200
I understand the gold fever.

25:25.734 --> 25:26.900
he just said, "Where was I?"

25:29.066 --> 25:30.600
Rick, you're underwater.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.867
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, baby.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.166
On the outskirts
of town.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.400
When people come up here,
I end up having
to take care of them.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.700
I don't like that.

25:55.133 --> 25:58.500
Vernon Adkison's
helping hand continues
to shine,

25:58.500 --> 26:01.967
but this time
with a new diving prospect.

26:01.967 --> 26:04.200
I've got Bryson up
at my camp out here.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.533
He wants to dive with us.

26:05.533 --> 26:07.100
I don't know
how that's gonna work out.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.233
He's never done
any ocean diving.

26:09.233 --> 26:13.400
Supposedly, he's done
some dredging
in the rivers and creeks.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.400
The Kellys have me
in a foul mood.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.667
And if that's not enough,
we're doing some fixes
on the gold ship,

26:18.667 --> 26:21.500
so we're going
to need to up production
when it's ready.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.900
So I'm bringing
in an extra diver, Bryson.

26:24.900 --> 26:28.066
I don't know much about him,
except he's from out of town,

26:28.066 --> 26:30.233
and he's broke,
so I'm letting him

26:30.233 --> 26:32.433
stay in a trailer
that I've got for now.

26:33.734 --> 26:35.467
I'm not up here
to take care of people.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.867
People need to take care
of themselves.

26:37.867 --> 26:39.667
Dammit, you got
to feed yourself.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.667
You got to buy your own
frigging toilet paper.

26:42.667 --> 26:46.634
I stood in your cabin
with a plastic bag

26:46.634 --> 26:49.634
underneath my ass
taking a [bleep].

26:49.634 --> 26:52.066
And the only reason
that I had toilet paper

26:52.066 --> 26:54.233
was because you left
a roll there.

26:54.233 --> 26:56.400
That's not my responsibility.

26:56.400 --> 27:00.200
But invariably,
it seems like I do.

27:00.200 --> 27:05.367
So it's kind of how
I'm feeling about
the situation with Bryson.

27:05.367 --> 27:08.066
I give the guy a helping hand,
the next thing you know,

27:08.066 --> 27:11.600
every time he needs money
for food, he calls me.

27:11.600 --> 27:15.233
What kind of deal is that?

27:15.233 --> 27:19.834
I told this kid to organize
everything in my yard,
make himself useful.

27:19.834 --> 27:22.467
So hopefully he's doing
something other than

27:22.467 --> 27:24.600
living rent free
and mooching off me.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.400
There's no lack of stuff
around here.

27:36.433 --> 27:38.266
A lot of stuff.

27:38.266 --> 27:40.233
So now it's a matter
of getting all this stuff

27:40.233 --> 27:42.300
organized so that it's useful.

27:44.967 --> 27:48.734
So how are you doing
for heat and all that?

27:48.734 --> 27:50.767
That electric heater
definitely isn't enough

27:50.767 --> 27:52.033
to keep you dry in there.

27:52.033 --> 27:53.567
It is damp.

27:53.567 --> 27:56.900
So what...
what about the propane?

27:56.900 --> 27:58.266
I haven't got
that hooked up.

27:59.567 --> 28:01.767
It produces
carbon monoxide, doesn't it?

28:01.767 --> 28:03.300
No.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.033
If you're cold, it your fault.

28:07.367 --> 28:10.367
Go and figure out
how to hook up
a heater and make it warm.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.867
Okay.

28:12.867 --> 28:13.967
Yeah, well, I...

28:13.967 --> 28:15.900
That last bit of cash
you gave me,

28:15.900 --> 28:18.400
that went the first day
for gas for the jeep.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.266
I got a jerry can of gas
and I bought groceries.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.000
So, I mean...

28:23.000 --> 28:25.333
Yeah, I got to...

28:25.333 --> 28:26.900
I got to get mining
or something.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.367
You could go down there,
do the beach mining thing,
get yours.

28:30.367 --> 28:31.467
Well, yeah.

28:31.467 --> 28:33.667
Even if I could get 20,
40 bucks a day,

28:33.667 --> 28:34.900
that would help out
because you know

28:34.900 --> 28:36.100
how expensive things
are, in Nome?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.634
It's pretty bad.

28:37.634 --> 28:40.233
If you get down there,
you'll be doing better
than that.

28:41.433 --> 28:44.467
I've given this guy a place
to stay and money to live on.

28:44.467 --> 28:46.367
And what's his response?

28:46.367 --> 28:48.834
Thank you, Vernon.
So gracious of you, Vernon.

28:48.834 --> 28:51.066
Look at the work I've done
for you, Vernon.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.634
No, I need money,
money, money.

28:53.634 --> 28:56.200
Like, go do some beach mining,
for God's sakes.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.500
I mean, come on, man.

29:00.333 --> 29:03.634
Well, I don't know. Like I...

29:03.634 --> 29:08.367
like I said, I'm not an ATM,
but I'll spot you
a couple more bucks.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.066
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

29:11.066 --> 29:12.233
And then you make it
your business

29:12.233 --> 29:15.033
to get your heater set up,
do the beach minding thing.

29:15.033 --> 29:17.567
Get your own separate
operation going.

29:17.567 --> 29:19.400
All right. Well, we got to go.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.700
Well, thank you
very much, Vernon.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.800
- Mm-hmm.
- I appreciate what you do.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.900
Thank you.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.433
- Yep.
- You're welcome.

29:30.133 --> 29:31.400
Working out the money.

29:34.133 --> 29:36.033
Sick and tired
of this [bleep].

29:38.000 --> 29:41.166
If it turns out that
he's a screw up of some type,

29:41.166 --> 29:43.533
then I've lost all that money.

29:44.834 --> 29:47.066
And I'm not up here
to lose money.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.900
Back in the harbor.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.266
Always excites me
when I beat the boss.

30:04.266 --> 30:06.233
I'm 11 minutes late.

30:06.233 --> 30:08.967
But Nome time, I'm...

30:10.133 --> 30:11.400
I'm on time.

30:12.734 --> 30:14.266
The early bird...

30:14.266 --> 30:17.200
Well, the earlier bird
catches the skiff.

30:23.133 --> 30:25.567
Here he comes.

30:25.567 --> 30:28.400
Officially,
Zeke is 44 minutes late.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.900
Nome time,
he's only 15 minutes later.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.900
You are in slow motion today?

30:32.900 --> 30:34.266
Yeah. Kind of.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.700
I just got to get
my blood going.

30:36.700 --> 30:37.934
Are we forgetting anything?

30:37.934 --> 30:39.500
I don't think
I'm forgetting anything.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.734
Good to go.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.867
Just gonna go on
a little boat ride.

30:46.867 --> 30:48.533
This summer,
I made a deal with Shawn

30:48.533 --> 30:50.800
to work on Tomcod
for a percentage if me

30:50.800 --> 30:52.834
and my brother
fixed up the Havilah.

30:52.834 --> 30:56.266
Gabe's close to launch,
but I'm already mining
with my little dredge,

30:56.266 --> 30:58.300
and I want to hit
50 ounces with that.

30:58.300 --> 31:02.166
And so far, all I've managed
to get is just under 3.5.

31:02.166 --> 31:05.200
The good news is,
last time out,
we hit a good pay streak.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.333
So I'm going to go back out
there and try to ride it out.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.000
The gold's going this way
right under the boat.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.500
So I'm gonna
start right there.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.667
I'm gonna work back.

31:20.667 --> 31:23.400
So probably at some point,
have you let out anchor line

31:23.400 --> 31:24.567
and drift me back this way.

31:24.567 --> 31:25.800
Oh, okay.

31:46.934 --> 31:49.100
How's the vis down there?

31:49.100 --> 31:51.634
- It's pretty cloudy.
- Oh, man.

31:51.634 --> 31:53.634
I'm going to do
my best to work with it.

31:53.634 --> 31:55.834
It's what I got.

31:55.834 --> 31:58.433
Okay. Pretty cloudy
but go for it.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.934
Looking aorund for that marker
that I left.

32:02.934 --> 32:07.533
The buoy is right off
the port side bow right here
about ten feet away.

32:07.533 --> 32:08.867
I don't know
where the heck I am.

32:08.867 --> 32:11.033
I thought I was right on top
of the buoy.

32:11.033 --> 32:13.200
Okay. Well, let me look
at your bubbles here.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.300
Oh, oh, oh.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.200
Okay. Now.

32:21.233 --> 32:24.967
Okay, you are about
25 feet off

32:24.967 --> 32:28.100
the starboard side amidship.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.400
Okay. I'm trying to go over
into the port now.

32:37.033 --> 32:38.333
Oh, there it is.

32:39.934 --> 32:41.400
Okeydokey, Smoky.

32:42.934 --> 32:44.900
See, there's some
good stuff right here.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.300
Gonna get further up
in these rocks.

32:52.834 --> 32:53.934
It's weird.

32:53.934 --> 32:55.467
Okay, what about this stuff?

33:00.700 --> 33:04.333
This clay just kind of
comes up out of the sand here.

33:04.333 --> 33:08.233
And there's some
really, really hot gold in it.

33:09.433 --> 33:11.467
There it is.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.834
A lot of it is just right
on the surface.

33:13.834 --> 33:15.266
Looking good.

33:16.367 --> 33:18.166
Yeah, the gold's pretty good
all through here.

33:18.166 --> 33:20.634
But there's spots
where it gets humid
and really hot.

33:20.634 --> 33:24.066
And I want to try
to stay in the places
where it gets really hot.

33:24.066 --> 33:26.767
Divining rods, these are

33:26.767 --> 33:30.867
the gold getting boogeyman.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.867
Yeah.

33:32.867 --> 33:34.967
There's just gold
all through this stuff.

33:36.834 --> 33:39.367
See? Oh, gee,
there's gold right there.

33:39.367 --> 33:41.700
Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.767
Definitely the best stuff
I've found all year.

33:44.767 --> 33:47.333
They say they'll come
right together
whenever there's gold.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.033
There's all manner
of gold out here.

33:49.033 --> 33:50.600
These things are going crazy.

33:51.867 --> 33:53.634
Yeah. It's really, really hot.

33:53.634 --> 33:55.667
Damn.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.800
Boom.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.100
They cross powerfully
right away.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.967
Can't leave this gold behind.

34:00.967 --> 34:02.700
Zeke's done the homework.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.300
This is gold country.

34:17.834 --> 34:19.100
Put it up on the trailer.

34:20.467 --> 34:21.533
You got it.

34:21.533 --> 34:22.667
Yeah, I'm pushing it up.

34:22.667 --> 34:23.800
A little more.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.133
Good.

34:25.133 --> 34:27.467
Vernon told
the Kellys to stop using

34:27.467 --> 34:30.233
his trailer that
they've already damaged.

34:30.233 --> 34:33.000
Hook that side the same way
that side's hooked.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.900
Well,
this is going to shock you.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.500
We're gonna use
this trailer anyway.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.066
We're gonna put it
in the water with

34:39.066 --> 34:40.567
or without
Vernon's permission.

34:40.567 --> 34:41.667
him and yeah.

34:41.667 --> 34:44.634
- to the rubber hose.
- Right here.

34:46.934 --> 34:49.500
So we've got to put
the new pontoons
under the boat.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.033
And then we need the trailer
to put it back in the water.

34:52.033 --> 34:55.367
Vernon said don't use
the trailer again,
but he's not here.

34:55.367 --> 34:58.033
So what he doesn't see
doesn't hurt him.

34:58.033 --> 34:59.433
Squeeze that in there.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.734
Let's do it before Vernon
comes back.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.233
Come on, you guys
want me to drive it?

35:06.233 --> 35:08.400
- Want to?
- Are you afraid?

35:08.400 --> 35:09.800
No.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.900
Cause Vernon won't yell at me.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.233
He won't yell anyways.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.367
He won't know.

35:15.367 --> 35:17.834
He'll just think the wheels
fell off in the end.

35:17.834 --> 35:19.166
Ready?

35:19.166 --> 35:20.400
Come on, let's go.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.200
Hurry, Andy.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.967
Hurry.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.900
I told y'all not to do that.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.166
Well,
I called the forklift.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.367
Said it's going to be
a couple hours.
I thought 3,500.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.100
Let's go to the bank.
I'll buy it right now.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.400
Let's go.

36:15.233 --> 36:16.834
Let's go. Drive it in.
Full blast.

36:16.834 --> 36:17.934
Beat this [bleep] up.

36:17.934 --> 36:19.033
Let's go drive it...

36:19.033 --> 36:20.533
Not until I get
my [bleep] damn money.

36:20.533 --> 36:21.800
You want to fight?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.667
Hey, you want
to fight, [bleep]?

36:23.667 --> 36:25.100
I don't want to hurt you.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.400
- Throw.
- I'm not chicken.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.367
I ain't gonna fight
with my fist.

36:28.367 --> 36:30.333
I'm a dirty [bleep], Vernon.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.567
I tell you, drive me over.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.734
Shut up.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.567
Drive me over. I'll pay you.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.367
You said 35. Let's go.

36:37.367 --> 36:38.467
- I got it.
- Let's go.

36:38.467 --> 36:39.900
Peanuts.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.166
Let's go.

36:43.333 --> 36:45.533
Come on. I don't want
to give you a heart attack.

36:45.533 --> 36:47.900
Don't worry about my heart.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.266
Hey, Andy.

36:49.266 --> 36:51.200
Don't move it until I get back
with my money.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.233
I'm waiting.
I'm waiting, Vernon.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.800
Haul ass. Let's go.

37:09.033 --> 37:10.734
Breathe in, Vernon. Breathe.

37:10.734 --> 37:13.233
It's all right.
I'll pay you 3,500.

37:15.200 --> 37:20.000
You know, I could use the word
pond scum to describe Brad.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.166
But honestly, that would be
doing a disservice
to pond scum.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.300
I was doing the guy a favor,
for God's sakes.

37:26.300 --> 37:28.033
And look at the thanks I get.

37:28.033 --> 37:32.300
He better give me that 3,500
without any monkey business
or there'll be trouble.

37:34.033 --> 37:35.500
There's your check.

37:36.667 --> 37:37.734
Let's go.

37:37.734 --> 37:39.634
I'm in a hurry. Time's money.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
There you go. See?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.367
Just like that.

37:46.367 --> 37:49.900
I told you. You want to smoke
a joint now in celebration?

37:49.900 --> 37:52.533
- I think I'll pass.
- I think you better.

37:52.533 --> 37:54.100
You getting all tense, man.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.834
It ain't that big of a deal.

37:57.266 --> 37:59.000
It's not that big of a deal
now I got money.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.166
Oh, calm down.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.834
So now I know how to shake
some money out of you.

38:04.834 --> 38:05.934
Yeah.

38:05.934 --> 38:07.567
Somebody break your

38:07.567 --> 38:09.266
Can I borrow your truck now?

38:09.266 --> 38:10.767
This is for my old truck.

38:15.767 --> 38:17.033
See you, Vernon.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.400
Went good.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.300
We own a new trailer.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.967
Is it a win-win, Vernon.

38:24.967 --> 38:27.200
Yeah. I paid 1,200
for the trailer.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.066
Yeah, that's a win-win.

38:31.066 --> 38:33.033
Now I can do whatever
the hell he wants
to it.

38:33.033 --> 38:34.400
He can run it till
the wheels fall off.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.166
Well, actually,
he already did that.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.100
Let me go cash this.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.467
Rush me to the bank.

38:44.467 --> 38:46.433
I got to put a stop payment
on that check.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.433
On the other side
of the harbor.

38:57.433 --> 38:59.100
I'm in a bad mood today.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.567
I got to turn this around.

39:01.567 --> 39:03.033
I don't know, dude.
You know what?

39:03.033 --> 39:06.133
I'm seeing gold stack up
in a lot of different places.

39:06.133 --> 39:09.200
But no matter what,
I need 100 ounces.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.900
I don't need 20.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.667
I got to turn this around.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.500
It's all because
of my excavators.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.433
All [bleep] season long,
it's because of excavators.

39:18.433 --> 39:21.767
Yesterday's fight
preempted a Kelly weigh out.

39:21.767 --> 39:25.634
So with The Mistress down,
it's time to scrape the box

39:25.634 --> 39:28.934
and see if anything came
from the precious few hours

39:28.934 --> 39:31.066
before the excavator
went kaput.

39:32.533 --> 39:34.867
10 ounces of gold
right now will at least

39:34.867 --> 39:37.800
take care of how much
it's going to cost to fix
the excavator.

39:39.166 --> 39:42.800
I see some color,
but I don't see ten ounces.

39:45.433 --> 39:47.867
Whatever we have,
we worked really hard for it.

39:47.867 --> 39:50.900
We went through
a lot of problems for it.

39:50.900 --> 39:54.333
, dude, we just need
the excavator
to run, you know?

39:54.333 --> 39:57.567
Nobody knows
how to fix it, and it's...

39:57.567 --> 39:59.734
It's stopping me
from making money.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.367
Yeah.

40:03.367 --> 40:05.500
Look, the excitement
from the fight kind of

40:05.500 --> 40:07.800
took away the great part
that we were on good gold

40:07.800 --> 40:10.233
yesterday and the night
crew came in, too,

40:10.233 --> 40:11.834
before the Mistress
broke down.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.367
So maybe we got lucky,
and we squeezed out

40:16.367 --> 40:19.600
some ounces of gold before
the excavator took the crap.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.834
Throw that in the back
of the truck.

40:21.834 --> 40:23.967
We need it with this
big payment due.

40:23.967 --> 40:26.233
And now even more repairs
are needed.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.767
Okay, let's go.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.400
Andy, come in here and start
scooping this [bleep].

40:37.567 --> 40:40.300
Okay, at least we're seeing
gold in every scoop, you know?

40:40.300 --> 40:41.734
So at least
that's the only thing

40:41.734 --> 40:43.266
going for me right now.

40:44.934 --> 40:47.800
Hey, that looks okay, huh?

40:47.800 --> 40:50.200
Without even seeing it
in the pan right now.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.767
It looks damn good.

40:51.767 --> 40:53.233
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

40:53.233 --> 40:56.533
We have $125,000 payment
to make in two weeks,

40:56.533 --> 40:58.266
and we're not even close.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.100
Right now,
I need a decent clean out,

41:00.100 --> 41:01.734
which is at least ten ounces.

41:01.734 --> 41:03.367
So I know that
we're getting gold

41:03.367 --> 41:05.567
and we can get out there back
on the pay streak

41:05.567 --> 41:08.100
for whatever the hell
we can actually mine again.

41:10.233 --> 41:11.900
Okay. Here we go.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.233
Come on, baby.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.500
That's what I'm
talking about.

41:23.133 --> 41:24.200
Okay, here we go.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.667
All right. Moment of truth.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.066
6.2 ounces.

41:33.066 --> 41:34.266
Looked like 10.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.900
Not that great,
but it is what we have.

41:40.900 --> 41:44.867
6.2 ounces
is worth over $11,000.

41:44.867 --> 41:48.266
Not within striking distance
of the funds Kris needs

41:48.266 --> 41:50.700
to keep
the Reaper Nation alive.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.133
So that's what we got.

41:52.133 --> 41:55.033
6.2 ounces for 16 hours
of bull [bleep].

41:55.033 --> 41:57.967
And it was bull [bleep].

41:57.967 --> 42:01.200
I was really hoping
we were going to get
a little bit more.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.900
Okay. Well, whatever.
That's it.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.300
The scale doesn't lie.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.233
So it's better than
a kick in the nuts.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.533
I'm under an extreme amount
of stress right now.

42:28.533 --> 42:31.400
I'm on edge of losing
all of this operation.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.166
If I can't prove I can make
money with this operation,

42:34.166 --> 42:36.500
Kevin will just sell it.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.700
With Reaper Nation
near the brink,

42:38.700 --> 42:40.700
Captain Kris Kelly
marches toward

42:40.700 --> 42:43.367
a pivotal meeting
with Mr. Gold.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.133
I'm gonna meet up
with Shawn Pomrenke right now.

42:47.133 --> 42:48.900
We're going to see
if we can talk through

42:48.900 --> 42:51.934
our differences
and work out our problems.

42:51.934 --> 42:56.734
Hopefully, we can because
I don't know what else
to do right now.

42:56.734 --> 42:59.400
I don't need to make
Shawn Pomrenke my enemy.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.000
You know, I just need
to work hard

43:02.000 --> 43:04.433
and mind my own business
is what I need to do.

43:04.433 --> 43:07.900
And I need Shawn to let me
co-exist in this town.

43:07.900 --> 43:09.133
We're gonna have
to get along.

43:09.133 --> 43:10.834
You know, I don't know
what else to say.

43:12.634 --> 43:14.834
Shawn reached out
and said he wants to meet.

43:14.834 --> 43:16.900
And honestly,
I'm jumping at the chance.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.567
I'm in a bad spot right now
and Shawn can make my life

43:19.567 --> 43:21.700
really difficult
if he tries to.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.200
Shawn knows everyone in town.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.667
It can cause me a lot
of headaches, and basically,

43:25.667 --> 43:28.166
my little empire
can collapse right before me.

43:28.166 --> 43:30.133
And I don't need
these [bleep] problems.

43:30.133 --> 43:31.700
I'm just trying to get gold.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.867
I just want to go mining.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.166
I don't want any more problems.

43:42.166 --> 43:43.867
I'm creating enough problems.

43:45.634 --> 43:46.967
I will be humble.

43:46.967 --> 43:48.667
I will make this work.

43:48.667 --> 43:51.800
I'm gonna give it
150% right now.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.033
I need to live
in this [bleep] town, too.

43:54.033 --> 43:56.567
You know, I'm buying a house.
We just had a baby.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.800
You know, I'm trying
to plan out a future here.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.000
I can't burn [bleep].

44:01.000 --> 44:03.467
Can't burn my bridges.

44:03.467 --> 44:06.233
I just need to start showing
Shawn the proper respect

44:06.233 --> 44:07.867
that he thinks he deserves.

44:09.967 --> 44:11.867
This is such [bleep] [bleep].

44:18.333 --> 44:20.967
Kris, if he's gonna play
with the big boys,

44:20.967 --> 44:24.133
he's got to [bleep] follow
the same rules.

44:24.133 --> 44:26.433
18 years I've been
on this ocean doing this.

44:27.634 --> 44:30.066
I know the rules.
I know the regulations.

44:30.066 --> 44:33.834
And Kris, he's just like,
"Oh, I don't give a [bleep]."

44:33.834 --> 44:38.600
Then he goes and jumps
on our spot and [bleep] up
my whole mining plan.

44:38.600 --> 44:43.467
And I'm not going
to let Kris Kelly
this up.

44:43.467 --> 44:46.000
But the problem is,
he never wants to listen.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.467
He just wants to run his mouth

44:48.467 --> 44:49.934
and keep talking
and keep talking.

44:49.934 --> 44:52.433
And it's like he needs
to just listen.

44:52.433 --> 44:55.033
And if I can't reason
with him and talk to him,

44:55.033 --> 44:58.500
then it's gonna come down
to somebody's gonna get
their ass kicked,

44:58.500 --> 45:01.000
and I'd rather not do that.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.667
Gold mining is my life.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.000
It's how I make my living.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.266
I care about
the integrity of it.

45:06.266 --> 45:07.734
Kris, he doesn't get it.

45:07.734 --> 45:10.734
But I was once in his shoes
many, many years ago.

45:10.734 --> 45:14.433
He's trying to reach
the same dreams
I've been able to realize.

45:14.433 --> 45:16.500
He's just got
to do it the right way.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.467
And despite everything
that's happened,
I want to hear him out.

45:22.834 --> 45:24.400
Oh, man.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.533
I hope this all goes good.
I really do.

45:27.533 --> 45:31.100
I don't need to
in my life anymore, you know.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.467
We're gonna squash
this [bleep].

45:55.100 --> 45:57.533
'Cause the way it's going
right now, it's got to end.

45:57.533 --> 45:59.100
- Yeah.
- get it.

45:59.100 --> 46:05.033
I don't want to see you fail,
but if you keep stepping
on my toes, then I...

46:05.033 --> 46:08.333
then... then I'm gonna be
forced to do things that
I don't want to do.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.433
And it's like you keep
with me

46:10.433 --> 46:12.967
and a lot of people
are gonna [bleep] hate you.

46:12.967 --> 46:14.367
Yeah.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.433
I want to live in this town.
I really do.

46:18.433 --> 46:19.867
You know,
and I'm buying a house.

46:19.867 --> 46:21.767
I just started a family.
I'm sorry.

46:21.767 --> 46:24.867
You know, like, um,
whatever I got to do
to make this work, okay?

46:24.867 --> 46:26.667
Well, you know, we...

46:26.667 --> 46:28.667
You not on a six inch
dredge anymore.

46:28.667 --> 46:29.767
- No, right.
- Yeah.

46:29.767 --> 46:32.133
Yeah, and there's a lot
of different rules, and...

46:32.133 --> 46:34.867
and if we keep playing
this [bleep] game,

46:34.867 --> 46:36.734
we're gonna [bleep] it up
for everybody.

46:36.734 --> 46:38.600
- And I don't want that.
- And then... then what?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.433
Then we don't have [bleep].

46:40.433 --> 46:42.800
Look, buddy, I'm...
I'm stressing right now.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.700
I'm barely hanging on
to everything.

46:44.700 --> 46:47.033
My gold cleanups
are [bleep] joke.

46:47.033 --> 46:48.800
I'm doing my best
to make all this work.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.533
I don't want...

46:50.533 --> 46:53.433
You know, I want to work
with you and get along
with you and everything.

46:53.433 --> 46:54.600
- Be cool.
- Yeah.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.867
- I really do.
- There's plenty
of ground out there.

46:56.867 --> 46:59.867
You know what, I don't
that you're out there.

46:59.867 --> 47:01.967
Let's just keep
the fair distance.

47:01.967 --> 47:03.967
- I will.
- And 'cause y'all, we...

47:03.967 --> 47:06.567
we come up with a mining plan
and we're taking our cuts,

47:06.567 --> 47:08.967
and then you come and park,
and it's like [bleep].

47:08.967 --> 47:11.333
Even on the boat that day,
to be honest with you, man,

47:11.333 --> 47:13.967
I'm running around doing
other [bleep] and...

47:13.967 --> 47:18.367
Um, but I take responsibility
for everything my crew does.

47:18.367 --> 47:19.667
- Yeah.
- You know, and I...

47:19.667 --> 47:21.300
I will take care
of everything.

47:21.300 --> 47:26.133
And you know what? I...
I'm not 100% innocent
and all this either, but I...

47:26.133 --> 47:28.467
I... I said,
I'm thinking too smart.

47:28.467 --> 47:30.133
And it was like
we got [bleep] stop.

47:30.133 --> 47:31.333
This is strictly like
a [bleep].

47:31.333 --> 47:33.100
Yeah. Yeah.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.333
Like, I don't... I don't...
We don't need this, dude.

47:35.333 --> 47:37.266
- Yeah.
- We're trying
to make it in this world.

47:37.266 --> 47:40.500
I'm... I'm telling you, man,
I'm gonna start being
more courteous,

47:40.500 --> 47:43.834
and I just want
to work together
and make this work.

47:43.834 --> 47:45.767
- Yeah, we'll start it over.
- Okay. Thanks, buddy.

47:45.767 --> 47:47.033
- Yeah.
- You know, really.

47:47.033 --> 47:49.000
Any problems, you call me
and I'll take care of it.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.266
All right.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.567
I think everything went great.
I had to move forward.

48:00.567 --> 48:06.000
I don't have the time
or resources to fight
a... a millionaire.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.266
You know,
like I'm barely scraping by.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.400
So maybe my problem
is I just don't show

48:11.400 --> 48:16.233
Shawn the proper respect
and I'm probably gonna
have to from now on.

48:16.233 --> 48:18.066
All I did was bend the knee.

48:19.433 --> 48:21.667
Or, you know,
saying sorry is free.

48:21.667 --> 48:23.066
So, who gets to [bleep].

48:25.367 --> 48:26.867
He seems sincere.

48:26.867 --> 48:28.467
So hopefully he is.

48:28.467 --> 48:31.867
But I'll keep him
at a safe distance.

48:31.867 --> 48:35.467
But if he does,
'cause if he does
get too close to me,

48:35.467 --> 48:37.266
and it's not gonna end well.

48:38.867 --> 48:42.000
And hopefully
we can just all play nice.

48:48.700 --> 48:49.767
Yo.

48:49.767 --> 48:51.033
Hi.

48:51.033 --> 48:52.200
How you doing?

48:56.400 --> 48:58.700
Zeke Tenhoff
is on his longest dive

48:58.700 --> 49:01.867
of the season,
trying to make up
for lost time.

49:16.567 --> 49:19.133
You just keep mining
until you want to stop.

49:23.166 --> 49:25.000
There's no chance of that.

49:26.533 --> 49:27.934
He's pretty burnt out.

49:27.934 --> 49:29.867
I can really empathize
with him.

49:29.867 --> 49:31.700
He's been in the water.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.266
7 hours, 20 minutes.

50:00.467 --> 50:01.967
That you will.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.233
The gold doctor.

50:05.233 --> 50:07.533
So, Zeke, did you decide
to come up?

50:09.133 --> 50:11.166
Okey-dokey smoky.

50:11.166 --> 50:12.700
There it is.

50:25.734 --> 50:28.200
It's been a while
since I've done a dive
that was that long.

50:28.200 --> 50:31.100
But we needed it
because these pockets
are pretty much empty.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.066
And the good news
is that it was easily

50:33.066 --> 50:35.500
the best gold that
I've seen all summer.

50:35.500 --> 50:38.433
I was so excited I couldn't
suck it up fast enough.

50:38.433 --> 50:40.500
And now, for the first time
in quite a while,

50:40.500 --> 50:41.667
I'm excited about a cleanup.

50:41.667 --> 50:43.367
I think it's gonna be
a good one.

50:43.367 --> 50:45.300
Get all the suffering
out of the way.

50:45.300 --> 50:47.367
- If you find something good.
- Nice.

50:47.367 --> 50:49.100
I like to end things
on a high note.

50:49.100 --> 50:50.967
Yeah.

50:50.967 --> 50:53.867
I mean, people do
a lot worse thing
for a lot less money.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.934
On the Nome coast...

51:03.934 --> 51:05.734
Well, the thing
with Bryson,

51:05.734 --> 51:07.767
it's becoming very clear
that this guy

51:07.767 --> 51:10.634
is about 98% bull [bleep].

51:10.634 --> 51:13.433
Once again,
Vernon's soft side

51:13.433 --> 51:15.800
may be coming back
to bite him.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.166
Right now I'm going out here
and lay down the law to him.

51:18.166 --> 51:20.500
I'm already into him.
Put several hundred dollars.

51:21.634 --> 51:23.834
Putting him up,
giving him a place to stay.

51:23.834 --> 51:28.066
I told him how to go down
on the beach and make money.

51:28.066 --> 51:30.634
Well, he chose to ignore me.

51:30.634 --> 51:33.500
And then every time I see him,
he's got his hand out.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.367
Think I'm his own
personal damn ATM.

51:37.634 --> 51:40.066
So now I've got
this dependent [bleep],

51:40.066 --> 51:42.834
thinking I'm his daddy
or his caretaker,

51:42.834 --> 51:44.767
and that ain't gonna float.

51:44.767 --> 51:47.066
I'm cutting him off
at the knees.

51:47.066 --> 51:48.533
He wants to make it up here.

51:48.533 --> 51:50.066
You got to do it like
everybody else does.

51:50.066 --> 51:51.734
And that's hard scrabble.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.867
You've got to get your ass out
there with a shovel

51:53.867 --> 51:57.333
in your hand and turn over
some material on that beach.

51:57.333 --> 52:01.066
If nothing else is going on,
you can always make enough

52:01.066 --> 52:04.333
to keep body and soul together
on that beach.

52:04.333 --> 52:07.000
And I let him stay
in this RV out here

52:07.000 --> 52:09.900
with the understanding
that he was gonna clean
the property.

52:09.900 --> 52:12.233
And so far,
he hasn't done anything.

52:12.233 --> 52:14.734
No more. I'm not giving him
another damn dime.

52:14.734 --> 52:17.266
And if he wants to stay there
where he's at right now,

52:17.266 --> 52:20.300
he's gonna work off the money
I've already given him.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.600
I'm not running
a damn clown show here.

52:30.367 --> 52:32.767
A lot of trash
around this place.

52:32.767 --> 52:35.500
They're a little bit
down here in the last
couple of weeks.

52:36.533 --> 52:38.934
Frustrating is [bleep].

52:38.934 --> 52:40.934
Sick of this crap.

52:40.934 --> 52:42.600
I'm just trying
to help.

52:42.600 --> 52:46.033
You know, like, I didn't come
up here to bottom out

52:46.033 --> 52:47.934
the way that I am and get
treated like dog [bleep].

52:52.467 --> 52:53.767
Dog [bleep]?

52:53.767 --> 52:56.000
I'm treating him
like dog [bleep].

52:56.000 --> 52:57.867
I'm putting money
into his manicured

52:57.867 --> 52:59.767
little hands
while he's doing nothing.

52:59.767 --> 53:02.967
And this jerk thinks
that's the crime
of the century.

53:02.967 --> 53:05.333
Okay, how much money
did I give you?

53:05.333 --> 53:07.200
And a place to live
and a car to drive

53:07.200 --> 53:08.767
and I treat you like [bleep]?

53:08.767 --> 53:09.867
- You're yelling at me.
- No.

53:09.867 --> 53:12.100
Yeah. And look, [bleep].
Ass [bleep].

53:12.100 --> 53:15.066
I've told you ten different
ways how to get
gold on the beach.

53:15.066 --> 53:16.266
You know what I'm not

53:16.266 --> 53:18.000
Get out of that trailer

53:18.000 --> 53:19.166
- now!
- I'm going in right now.

53:19.166 --> 53:20.533
I'm not dealing
with your abuse, buddy.

53:20.533 --> 53:23.533
I put the last $40
in his hand yesterday.

53:23.533 --> 53:25.900
400 [bleep] dollars
and a wet place to stay

53:25.900 --> 53:27.000
ain't worth being yelled at.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.433
you.

53:28.433 --> 53:31.100
You get your ass...
Get your ragged ass
out of there.

53:32.834 --> 53:35.066
You'll have a heart attack.
You [bleep].

53:36.200 --> 53:38.700
You can't
just yelling at people.

53:38.700 --> 53:40.433
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

53:40.433 --> 53:42.333
You little [bleep].

53:42.333 --> 53:45.934
[bleep] snowflake.

53:45.934 --> 53:48.834
Has no appreciation
for the money and the fact

53:48.834 --> 53:51.333
that I put him up
in that motorhome over there.

53:51.333 --> 53:55.266
A 40 foot motor coach,
provided him with a generator,

53:55.266 --> 53:57.333
a tank of propane.

53:57.333 --> 54:02.700
Gasoline for the generator,
gasoline for the car
and money for food.

54:03.734 --> 54:05.900
And does he have appreciation?

54:05.900 --> 54:08.367
No. So, [bleep] him.

54:08.367 --> 54:13.400
Maybe, just maybe, after this,
jack wad and Brad Kelly,

54:13.400 --> 54:17.333
I finally learned my lesson
about giving worthless people
a break.

54:17.333 --> 54:20.967
Because all they do
is take advantage of you
and screw you in the end.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.800
So, I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.166
Everyone can just
kiss my ass.

54:25.166 --> 54:26.900
I was actually
not gonna fire him.

54:26.900 --> 54:28.800
I was just gonna chew
his ass out.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.100
But he's a snowflake.

54:30.100 --> 54:33.233
He can't take an action
because it hurts
his little [bleep].

54:33.233 --> 54:35.066
if he gets yelled at.

54:40.767 --> 54:42.433
Two miles east...

54:49.467 --> 54:50.867
Ooh.

54:50.867 --> 54:52.233
Wow.

54:52.233 --> 54:54.133
That's him moving
a big boulder.

54:54.133 --> 54:55.934
hoping
there's gold underneath.

54:57.166 --> 54:58.700
How's it looking down there?

55:04.033 --> 55:05.233
Copy that.

55:05.233 --> 55:07.033
Awesome. Good times.

55:08.166 --> 55:09.600
Time for gold.

55:09.600 --> 55:12.166
With Jane
at the helm for the day,

55:12.166 --> 55:15.033
the Eroica is on the gold.

55:15.033 --> 55:18.634
Emily went to town, so,
I'm here on my second time
by myself.

55:18.634 --> 55:21.333
I'm doing pretty okay.
We got this guy.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.200
Oh.

55:35.467 --> 55:37.700
Yeah, that's swell
definitely just came in.

56:02.133 --> 56:04.033
Okay, roger that.
all your levels look great.

56:04.033 --> 56:05.200
Good times.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.033
Phew, phew. Ow.

56:07.033 --> 56:09.133
He's really vocal
down there.

56:11.834 --> 56:15.500
I have a feeling I know
what he's like in bed,
in the sack.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.467
That sound like
when he finds gold.

56:17.467 --> 56:19.767
Not that I need to.

56:19.767 --> 56:21.634
Just he's very vocal.

56:27.734 --> 56:29.000
Sorry.

56:34.066 --> 56:35.700
Jane, how's it going?

56:35.700 --> 56:36.967
Oh, it's going good.

56:36.967 --> 56:39.166
I came back, because
the boat is tonight...

56:39.166 --> 56:42.266
after the dive,
I don't want to leave

56:42.266 --> 56:43.767
the boat out overnight.

56:47.467 --> 56:50.166
Hey, what's...
what's up, Rick?

56:53.033 --> 56:57.000
Yeah, the... the swell
actually is definitely getting
a lot worse.

57:03.400 --> 57:06.400
Ah, sounds like Rick's
really struggling down there

57:06.400 --> 57:08.900
to have a swell winds
kind of coming up.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.667
Ooh.

57:16.667 --> 57:18.600
All right, Rick.
You want to wrap it up?

57:30.200 --> 57:31.934
Yo, Jane, he's up.

57:32.967 --> 57:34.400
He's up?

57:36.700 --> 57:37.900
Ooh.

57:41.934 --> 57:45.266
It's a bummer,
the waves kind of
pushed us off. 14.

57:45.266 --> 57:48.033
But how about Jane?
Jane is rocking it.

57:48.033 --> 57:49.467
Even though
the waves kicked us off,

57:49.467 --> 57:52.233
Jane handled the situation,
Rick got on some gold,

57:52.233 --> 57:55.000
and her first day out
by herself was awesome.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.767
Okay don't...
Don't strain your back.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.467
Good job.

58:00.467 --> 58:02.433
She wasn't sure about
this gold mining business

58:02.433 --> 58:04.266
at first,
but she's super adaptable

58:04.266 --> 58:05.867
and she's really getting
the hang of things.

58:05.867 --> 58:07.133
Pull back, pull back.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.000
Ah...

58:11.000 --> 58:13.033
Done.

58:13.033 --> 58:15.634
With me being pregnant
and kind of out of play.

58:15.634 --> 58:18.266
She's pretty much exactly
what the doctor ordered.

58:18.266 --> 58:19.734
Literally.

58:20.767 --> 58:22.066
I look at the box.

58:22.066 --> 58:23.800
Yeah, nice.
It's nice and golden.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.100
That is...

58:26.133 --> 58:27.266
Nugget.

58:27.266 --> 58:29.266
Big baddy nugget on board.

58:29.266 --> 58:31.033
Oh, yeah.
That's a good nugget.

58:31.033 --> 58:32.700
Oh, damn. Look at that.

58:32.700 --> 58:34.700
Lots of nuggets
coming my way, baby.

58:34.700 --> 58:36.300
That's what I call a good day.

58:36.300 --> 58:38.233
Holy, whack a moly.
It's so pretty.

58:38.233 --> 58:39.800
Yeah. Isn't it?

58:42.233 --> 58:43.834
You got
the Midas touch.

58:57.233 --> 58:59.634
Let me drive it in.
Get her on [bleep].

58:59.634 --> 59:01.333
Go ahead.

59:01.333 --> 59:05.033
Now, the Kellys
are the proud owners
of Vernon's trailer.

59:05.033 --> 59:08.834
It's time to get the new
and improved Reaper back
in the water.

59:08.834 --> 59:11.133
Vernon almost had
a heart attack, bro.

59:12.166 --> 59:13.500
Poor old bastard.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.233
And there she rolls.

59:23.367 --> 59:24.734
Slow down, Dad.

59:24.734 --> 59:26.533
- You lost the tire.
- Yeah.

59:26.533 --> 59:28.066
Well, we lost some tire.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.333
Well, the trailer
cost us 3500 more.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.400
We didn't really have,
but we got it.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.934
So now we can get
the boat back in the water

59:38.934 --> 59:40.533
and tie her to the docks.

59:40.533 --> 59:42.400
We'll head out with her
in the morning.

59:47.233 --> 59:48.467
Okay, go ahead.

1:00:13.467 --> 1:00:15.767
They better not have pull me
out here with no gas.

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:21.900
They probably did.

1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:31.934
Yeah, my dad's,
something else, you know.

1:00:31.934 --> 1:00:34.467
puts me on a boat
with no gas.

1:00:37.934 --> 1:00:39.967
He breaks the trailer
and no gas.

1:00:39.967 --> 1:00:42.200
Really, Dad? Unbelievable.

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.300
Come on, baby.

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.667
You know, [bleep] God.

1:00:54.634 --> 1:00:57.900
He says it's current.

1:00:59.867 --> 1:01:02.967
So, I'm about 200 feet away
from the dock and I'm using

1:01:02.967 --> 1:01:05.233
the wind to blow me
in where I need to go.

1:01:10.066 --> 1:01:11.667
This is [bleep] stupid.

1:01:14.066 --> 1:01:15.333
Hey, what's up?

1:01:15.333 --> 1:01:18.467
Hey, man. Saving fuel.
I like that. Let the wind
do the work.

1:01:18.467 --> 1:01:20.967
Yeah, it's coming around
right now.

1:01:20.967 --> 1:01:22.333
And I love this.

1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:24.867
Pull me in.

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:30.800
Couldn't have asked
for a better parking job
than that.

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:32.400
That was good piloting.

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:35.667
Yeah, that's just
too [bleep] funny, dude.

1:01:35.667 --> 1:01:38.667
Next time on the water,
this thing will make
the waves better.

1:01:38.667 --> 1:01:40.667
We can go faster.

1:01:40.667 --> 1:01:43.500
It could take the weight
of the water in my hose.

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:45.867
Yeah, a few hiccups,
right [bleep].

1:01:45.867 --> 1:01:48.233
But it's done.
Who give the [bleep]?

1:01:49.300 --> 1:01:50.900
Got a new trailer
out of the deal.

1:01:59.767 --> 1:02:01.900
I'll pick up
the spuds and go.

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:07.834
Oh, yeah.

1:02:07.834 --> 1:02:10.100
With repairs made
to the Myrtle Irene's

1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:14.367
shaker box and the war
with Kris Kelly hopefully
behind him.

1:02:14.367 --> 1:02:18.767
Shawn Pomrenke wastes no time
getting back to the Tomcod.

1:02:18.767 --> 1:02:22.667
Myrtle Irene leaving
the inner harbor,
headed for sea.

1:02:23.934 --> 1:02:25.900
Right now, we're right
where we want to be.

1:02:25.900 --> 1:02:30.000
The shaker plants fix,
the Myrtle Irene's
running great.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.600
And hopefully this dust up
with Kris is squashed for now.

1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:35.934
And I can get back to doing
what I need to do.

1:02:35.934 --> 1:02:38.467
Get gold. God knows I need it.

1:02:47.934 --> 1:02:49.700
We need to make some gold.

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:56.667
Oh, yeah.

1:02:57.867 --> 1:03:00.300
This stuff looks really good.

1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:09.934
Put a plane on the shaker.

1:03:09.934 --> 1:03:11.700
Seem to be working well.

1:03:14.634 --> 1:03:16.400
Everything brought in.

1:03:17.567 --> 1:03:19.500
Hopefully we can keep
it running.

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.800
We got the inland mine.

1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:32.567
Christine Rose, Myrtle.

1:03:32.567 --> 1:03:34.567
I need to keep them running.

1:03:36.367 --> 1:03:40.333
See dirt moving
as many hours that we can.

1:03:40.333 --> 1:03:43.500
The more hours
we put on the box,
the more gold we'll get.

1:03:51.934 --> 1:03:54.900
Ooh. That feels like
it's a problem.

1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:58.867
Hopefully the Bering Sea
is being kind.

1:04:03.133 --> 1:04:05.533
Just giving us a big old pile
of gold.

1:04:08.066 --> 1:04:10.400
They got to keep on putting
dirt in this box.

1:04:12.967 --> 1:04:14.734
There it is.

1:04:14.734 --> 1:04:17.400
There should be
some gold in the box.

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:18.734
I'm gonna find out.

1:04:37.266 --> 1:04:39.166
Yeah, there's gold down here.

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:43.900
It's looking good,
looking good.

1:04:45.634 --> 1:04:47.166
Oh, look at that.

1:04:47.166 --> 1:04:49.333
Oh, yeah.

1:04:49.333 --> 1:04:50.967
All right.

1:04:50.967 --> 1:04:52.266
Diggy, diggy.

1:04:53.834 --> 1:04:55.700
Time to pile up some gold.

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:06.900
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1:05:10.867 --> 1:05:12.767
If we keep
everything running.

1:05:12.767 --> 1:05:15.367
It'd be close
to 100 plus ounces.

1:05:17.066 --> 1:05:19.233
This pay streak
is the real deal.

1:05:19.233 --> 1:05:22.200
I'm gonna reposition
the Myrtle to get
into deeper water.

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:24.400
Get to that good gold.

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:27.734
We're gonna get triple digits
in the box this time for sure.

1:05:27.734 --> 1:05:28.900
I can feel it.

1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:31.400
All right.

1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:33.367
Let's get these spuds
jacked up and I'll pull us out

1:05:33.367 --> 1:05:35.333
into some deeper water.

1:05:52.667 --> 1:05:54.867
The spud's not
going up or down.

1:06:05.467 --> 1:06:07.100
Yeah. It's not moving.

1:06:15.734 --> 1:06:18.567
Oh, [bleep] [bleep] [bleep].

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.967
Dammit.

1:06:23.967 --> 1:06:26.567
I mean, we get out there
and check it out.

1:06:26.567 --> 1:06:27.800
Frustrated.

1:06:28.934 --> 1:06:31.700
First, the shaker.
Now the spud.

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:33.767
Man, it never stops.

1:06:33.767 --> 1:06:35.100
But this is a big deal.

1:06:37.033 --> 1:06:40.300
If we can't move the spud,
we can't move the Myrtle.

1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:41.634
Then we're screwed.

1:06:42.834 --> 1:06:44.300
Always something.

1:06:46.767 --> 1:06:50.166
We just got this thing
dialed in and now
it might be broke.

1:06:50.166 --> 1:06:51.500
Can't catch a break.

1:07:00.967 --> 1:07:04.367
We just got this thing
dialed in and now
it might be broke.

1:07:05.767 --> 1:07:07.066
Can't catch a break.

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:10.233
The good news
for Shawn Pomrenke,

1:07:10.233 --> 1:07:12.066
he's on the best gold
of the season.

1:07:13.834 --> 1:07:17.266
The bad news,
a stuck spud may force

1:07:17.266 --> 1:07:19.500
the Myrtle to shut down again.

1:07:29.934 --> 1:07:31.300
Damn it.

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.533
It's not moving.

1:07:39.033 --> 1:07:41.133
This spud is stuck.

1:07:41.133 --> 1:07:42.467
If we can't move the spud.

1:07:42.467 --> 1:07:44.400
We can't move the Myrtle.

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:48.233
If we can't move the Myrtle,
our season
is effectively over.

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:04.533
Come on.

1:08:14.567 --> 1:08:16.000
There it goes.

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.734
Thank God. The beast is free.

1:08:27.734 --> 1:08:29.367
Long live the Myrtle.

1:08:29.367 --> 1:08:30.834
Now we can get back to mining.

1:08:32.033 --> 1:08:33.934
Seems like
everything's working.

1:08:34.967 --> 1:08:36.200
All right.

1:08:42.567 --> 1:08:44.066
Something going on.

1:08:48.367 --> 1:08:49.800
You got bigger problems.

1:08:53.734 --> 1:08:55.767
Well the spud's up.

1:08:55.767 --> 1:09:00.200
But as we're inspecting it,
there's a huge crack.

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:03.133
This situation has taken on
a whole different dimension.

1:09:04.166 --> 1:09:06.667
Hard to see
how far down the well is.

1:09:06.667 --> 1:09:09.100
Yeah, it could be
a lot further.

1:09:11.867 --> 1:09:14.367
There's a crack
in the spud well.

1:09:14.367 --> 1:09:17.467
Well, it's the part
of the barge that holds
the spud in place.

1:09:17.467 --> 1:09:20.000
If the crack is big enough
in a big swell,

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.233
it could cause the spud well,
to break open.

1:09:23.233 --> 1:09:27.200
And if that happens,
water will gush into the hull
and sink the Myrtle.

1:09:32.567 --> 1:09:34.600
We are screwed for sure.

1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:37.133
Maybe best to be safe
than sorry.

1:09:40.166 --> 1:09:41.967
Yeah well, let's head in.

1:09:41.967 --> 1:09:43.834
I'll have
to pull the spud.

1:09:43.834 --> 1:09:45.834
See if we can weld it up.

1:09:48.333 --> 1:09:51.700
Hopefully the crack is small
and we'll get it
welded up quick.

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:54.634
But if it's big, we're gonna
have to replace the spud well,

1:09:54.634 --> 1:09:57.033
and that's a major project.

1:09:57.033 --> 1:09:59.100
And if that's the case,
I don't think we'll be able

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:01.700
to get back out
and mine this summer.

1:10:01.700 --> 1:10:05.834
Oh, go back to the harbor
to do repairs.

1:10:11.767 --> 1:10:15.166
There's some pretty big swells
and they're far apart.

1:10:15.166 --> 1:10:19.000
So, if I keep running it,
it'll just rip it apart more.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000
So, we're gonna go ahead
and repair.

1:10:22.033 --> 1:10:23.767
We got this thing
dialed in now,

1:10:23.767 --> 1:10:26.266
but we're over halfway
through the season.

1:10:27.333 --> 1:10:29.433
Breakdowns like this,
we don't need.

1:10:30.634 --> 1:10:32.300
We're gonna lose a full day.

1:10:32.300 --> 1:10:35.300
That could be 60, $70,000.

1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:37.767
But we push it.

1:10:37.767 --> 1:10:40.266
We'd lose the rest
of the season,

1:10:40.266 --> 1:10:42.000
and we're not gonna do that.

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:47.767
I'd end up sitting like
Kris Kelly in the harbor

1:10:47.767 --> 1:10:48.934
when the weather is good.

1:10:50.467 --> 1:10:51.634
This sucks.

1:10:51.634 --> 1:10:54.333
Just when we were getting hot,
hopefully we got

1:10:54.333 --> 1:10:55.767
some good gold
when we were out there.

1:10:55.767 --> 1:10:57.433
And this doesn't put us out
for too long.

1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:01.300
I hate bringing the dredge in,

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:05.266
but it's got
to keep her afloat
and hold her together.

1:11:06.934 --> 1:11:09.834
I do not feel like putting
this thing in a bad position

1:11:09.834 --> 1:11:11.233
that we can't get out of...

1:11:19.233 --> 1:11:21.400
Back in town...

1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:22.967
Kris man,
so what do you think?

1:11:22.967 --> 1:11:24.400
I think we're doing terrible.

1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:26.767
I hate to admit it, but,
you know, the amount

1:11:26.767 --> 1:11:28.567
of gold we got
right now is [bleep].

1:11:28.567 --> 1:11:30.100
It is.

1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:32.000
We're really not getting
a lot of time.

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.333
Yeah.

1:11:33.333 --> 1:11:37.133
Reaper Nations'
chief investor Kevin Adaimy

1:11:37.133 --> 1:11:40.066
is back in town
and cracking the whip

1:11:40.066 --> 1:11:42.433
on his beleaguered captain.

1:11:42.433 --> 1:11:44.333
We need... obviously,
we need a lot more gold.

1:11:44.333 --> 1:11:45.767
I mean, we got this
payment coming up,

1:11:45.767 --> 1:11:47.800
and we really got to make
that payment happen.

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:50.233
You know, we need
to see some results.

1:11:50.233 --> 1:11:53.266
We can't continue to just
put out money
and just get nothing for gold.

1:11:53.266 --> 1:11:54.734
You will see results.

1:11:54.734 --> 1:11:57.100
We just need a week
of running and we'll...

1:11:57.100 --> 1:11:58.500
we'll get a lot of gold.

1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:00.667
I'm trusting this operation
in your hands, buddy.

1:12:00.667 --> 1:12:02.300
Buddy,
this is all gonna work out.

1:12:02.300 --> 1:12:04.367
- You know, um...
- You know, the new excavator,
30% more.

1:12:04.367 --> 1:12:05.467
Yeah.

1:12:05.467 --> 1:12:07.000
You know, it'd be
a night crew we can trust.

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.600
Yeah. We just...
You know, it's just nervous.

1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:11.634
I'm nervous that, you know,
we have a big $125,000

1:12:11.634 --> 1:12:13.900
payment due, and we got
to hit that number.

1:12:13.900 --> 1:12:15.066
- I mean, we can't...
- Oh, I know.

1:12:15.066 --> 1:12:16.467
We can't...
maybe hit that number.

1:12:16.467 --> 1:12:18.934
It's a really serious deal.
We've got to get that going.

1:12:18.934 --> 1:12:20.300
No, I know it's gonna happen.

1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.367
I have never seen Kevin
this fired up.

1:12:23.367 --> 1:12:25.467
But that's a difference
of being Kevin's friend

1:12:25.467 --> 1:12:27.233
or Kevin's business partner.

1:12:27.233 --> 1:12:29.900
I promised him
this whole thing
would be a moneymaker.

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.000
But this thing's
barely staying afloat.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.934
And now, with the excavator
breaking down,

1:12:33.934 --> 1:12:36.834
it seems almost impossible
for us to make this payment.

1:12:36.834 --> 1:12:40.600
But I have to keep
a positive face
and calm him down.

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.066
You know, you're the captain
of the ship.

1:12:42.066 --> 1:12:43.734
You're the guy that
makes the decisions.

1:12:43.734 --> 1:12:46.333
Just make wise decisions
and call me and, you know,

1:12:46.333 --> 1:12:49.066
together, you know,
we can come up
with really good decisions.

1:12:49.066 --> 1:12:51.634
We can't make
any more mistakes,
is what I'm saying.

1:12:51.634 --> 1:12:53.233
All my decisions
have been cheap

1:12:53.233 --> 1:12:54.567
and they've been
the right decisions.

1:12:54.567 --> 1:12:55.934
Yes.

1:12:55.934 --> 1:12:58.367
Every little problem
that we've had has been
out of my control.

1:12:58.367 --> 1:13:01.834
To me, all I've seen
is a million excuses.

1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:04.533
This next month
is really important to me.

1:13:04.533 --> 1:13:06.867
I mean, at the end of the day,
if we don't get 100 ounces,

1:13:06.867 --> 1:13:08.433
we might have to start
selling stuff off

1:13:08.433 --> 1:13:10.033
to be able to make ends meet.

1:13:12.033 --> 1:13:14.533
If we just put in
24 hours a day

1:13:14.533 --> 1:13:16.166
and get out there
every opportunity,

1:13:16.166 --> 1:13:18.333
we're gonna make
a lot of gold.

1:13:18.333 --> 1:13:20.333
I know in my heart
that we can do this.

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:24.133
It's just that everything that
could go wrong has gone wrong.

1:13:24.133 --> 1:13:26.133
But the Mistress
is dialed in.

1:13:26.133 --> 1:13:28.900
The only real problem
that I have is an excavator.

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:32.900
All I need to do is get
the excavator running
every single day,

1:13:32.900 --> 1:13:36.000
24 hours a day,
and we are gonna
make tons of money.

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.100
If not, I might not only lose
this whole business,

1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:41.867
I might also lose
Kevin's friendship.

1:13:41.867 --> 1:13:43.900
Look, Kevin,
I really have this.

1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:46.266
I know Nome. I know the ocean.
I know gold.

1:13:46.266 --> 1:13:47.667
I know
this is gonna make money.

1:13:47.667 --> 1:13:49.500
We put together
this whole operation.

1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:51.100
Just trust me
a little while longer,

1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:52.667
and you're gonna be
real happy.

1:13:52.667 --> 1:13:54.533
I'm ready for that.
Let's go, man.

1:13:54.533 --> 1:13:56.433
- Take part in it.
- Let's make it happen.

1:13:56.433 --> 1:13:57.700
Let's do it.

1:14:05.533 --> 1:14:07.000
I'm gonna go
get some water.

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:10.600
I don't have a well.

1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.700
So, I've always
just hauled water.

1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:14.600
It's... it's convenient to buy
bottle of water,

1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:16.233
if you don't care about money.

1:14:16.233 --> 1:14:18.834
But it's not how the way
you should do it.

1:14:18.834 --> 1:14:20.400
Water should always be free.

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:22.834
And so, I'm gonna go
fill up my water jugs.

1:14:22.834 --> 1:14:26.700
Tonight,
on surviving Alaska
with Zeke Tenhoff.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.767
Everybody
has this idea that, like,

1:14:28.767 --> 1:14:30.600
if you drink water out
of like a little stream,

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:34.033
like it's gonna, like,
make you sick
because it's both [bleep].

1:14:34.033 --> 1:14:36.634
Learn Zeke's
three step plan for staying

1:14:36.634 --> 1:14:39.800
hydrated when you're living
off the land.

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:42.066
That whole mountainside
is really porous.

1:14:42.066 --> 1:14:44.767
So, like, all the water
is just flowing out of it.

1:14:44.767 --> 1:14:46.367
Just coming out of the ground.

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.533
I'm not gonna drink
right out of the river

1:14:51.533 --> 1:14:53.467
because there's a lot
of beavers.

1:14:55.767 --> 1:14:58.200
Likely you will get some
kind of like, parasite thing.

1:14:59.266 --> 1:15:00.700
After you're drinking
this water,

1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:03.300
you taste like city water,
tap water.

1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:04.433
It's awful.

1:15:04.433 --> 1:15:06.767
I mean, the water
that you get in town,

1:15:06.767 --> 1:15:10.033
it's like pumped full
of chemicals
and it spends its whole life

1:15:10.033 --> 1:15:12.533
like just getting
blasted through
all these plastic tubes.

1:15:12.533 --> 1:15:15.233
And like, in... No way.
No, it's not good.

1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:18.634
Like, I'm not a big
conspiracy guy, but, like,

1:15:18.634 --> 1:15:20.567
the explanation
for why they pump fluoride

1:15:20.567 --> 1:15:22.300
in your drinking water

1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:25.000
is to say that like,
it helps your teeth.

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.834
Like, why do they care
so much about your teeth?

1:15:27.834 --> 1:15:31.233
That's a conspiracy.
It's a grand conspiracy.

1:15:31.233 --> 1:15:32.667
There's something
going on there.

1:15:41.634 --> 1:15:42.767
Wait for it.

1:15:42.767 --> 1:15:44.333
Oh, hold on.

1:15:44.333 --> 1:15:46.100
Whoa!

1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:47.533
Down, girl. Down, girl.

1:15:49.533 --> 1:15:50.834
Um... All right.

1:15:50.834 --> 1:15:52.500
I get excited. I'm always...

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:53.734
- I'm always on it, like...
- Oh.

1:15:53.734 --> 1:15:55.333
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Gold.

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:56.500
Oh, boy.

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:58.800
Time to see
if the Eroica's new tender.

1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:01.500
Jane made it rain.

1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:02.567
Look at these guns.

1:16:02.567 --> 1:16:05.533
She was pulling up
that nozzle by herself.

1:16:05.533 --> 1:16:09.133
And I'm like, "Holy crap,
dude, she's got this."

1:16:09.133 --> 1:16:10.800
You barely got it up.

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:12.634
It builds muscle
and character.

1:16:12.634 --> 1:16:14.634
It's very important.

1:16:14.634 --> 1:16:16.934
Jane and Rick
are a power duo right now.

1:16:16.934 --> 1:16:19.300
They're just raking
in the gold,
and I'm digging it.

1:16:20.567 --> 1:16:21.967
All right,
let's see how we did.

1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:29.233
3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

1:16:29.233 --> 1:16:34.800
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:36.667
Break and turn, guys.

1:16:36.667 --> 1:16:41.233
14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

1:16:41.233 --> 1:16:42.900
Yes. Look at this.
Look at... look at...

1:16:42.900 --> 1:16:46.300
24, 25, 6,

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:49.467
7, 28.

1:16:49.467 --> 1:16:51.367
That's good.

1:16:51.367 --> 1:16:52.867
Nice. 28, man.

1:16:52.867 --> 1:16:54.300
Yes.

1:16:54.300 --> 1:16:55.834
0.6.

1:16:55.834 --> 1:16:58.200
28.6 ounces.

1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:00.634
That's worth over $50,000.

1:17:00.634 --> 1:17:06.500
And there has been nothing
plain about Jane's addition
to the Eroica crew.

1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:08.533
It's... Yeah,
it's great to have you.

1:17:08.533 --> 1:17:11.500
Have you here. While I do.
You know, pregnancy stuff.

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.333
- Bam.
- Nice.

1:17:13.333 --> 1:17:14.533
Good job.

1:17:14.533 --> 1:17:17.967
Nice. I'm so happy like
we're killing it right now.

1:17:17.967 --> 1:17:21.433
And 250 ounces
is right around the corner.

1:17:21.433 --> 1:17:23.600
Yeah, we're in awesome shape.

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:25.767
Wasn't much drama.
Yeah, it's a lot of gold.

1:17:27.133 --> 1:17:28.600
Let's get back
out there.

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:33.433
On the outskirts
of town...

1:17:36.233 --> 1:17:38.834
Got lots of gold
to pan.

1:17:38.834 --> 1:17:40.667
Yeah,
you got the hang of it?

1:17:40.667 --> 1:17:42.900
Oh, yeah. Look at that one.
Look at this.

1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.367
The gold is on top like that.

1:17:44.367 --> 1:17:46.200
Yeah.

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:48.000
Oh, yeah.

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:49.734
You're getting it cleaner
than me.

1:17:49.734 --> 1:17:52.834
The mad scientist
of Nome is ready to see

1:17:52.834 --> 1:17:56.266
if the new pay streak
is really paying.

1:17:56.266 --> 1:17:57.967
The new place
that I've been dredging.

1:17:57.967 --> 1:18:01.567
It's really good. Real hot.
I'm stoked about this cleanup.

1:18:01.567 --> 1:18:04.400
I think it's gonna be
a nice cleanup for sure.

1:18:06.834 --> 1:18:08.567
You know,
it's been a long, long time

1:18:08.567 --> 1:18:10.767
since I've had
a killer clean up.

1:18:10.767 --> 1:18:14.233
If ever there was a time
for one, it's right now.

1:18:14.233 --> 1:18:16.667
And without a heavy weigh out,
I'm not gonna have enough

1:18:16.667 --> 1:18:18.567
money to keep
the operation going.

1:18:18.567 --> 1:18:21.033
Despite Shawn putting us
out here on Tomcod.

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:24.166
That looks nice and clean.

1:18:35.634 --> 1:18:37.133
All right, here we go.

1:18:41.467 --> 1:18:42.900
One ounce.

1:18:44.367 --> 1:18:46.600
Four and a half.

1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:48.266
8.6.

1:18:48.266 --> 1:18:51.166
we broke 10. 11. 12.

1:18:51.166 --> 1:18:53.567
13, 14.

1:18:56.767 --> 1:19:00.634
Grand total.
Right there is 16.9 ounce.

1:19:00.634 --> 1:19:04.934
16.9 ounces
is worth over 30,000 bucks.

1:19:04.934 --> 1:19:09.200
The largest cleanout for Zeke
since his return
to the Bering Sea.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:14.734
A lot of work
goes into that pile
of gold right there.

1:19:14.734 --> 1:19:16.934
Oh, wow. I'm all of a sudden
now real successful.

1:19:16.934 --> 1:19:18.700
Whoa, whoa.
How'd that happen?

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:19.867
I really need this.

1:19:19.867 --> 1:19:22.967
Not just for my pocketbook,
but for morale.

1:19:24.166 --> 1:19:25.767
It hasn't been an easy year.

1:19:25.767 --> 1:19:28.333
And I mean, at times,
I question all of this

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:30.500
and whether I should be
mining at all.

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:32.533
But this is huge for me,
'cause it proves

1:19:32.533 --> 1:19:35.533
that being out on Tomcod
is really gonna pay.

1:19:35.533 --> 1:19:40.066
Cool. 10% of that
is 1.69 ounces for Steve.

1:19:41.100 --> 1:19:42.734
- There you go. Cool.
- Thanks, Zeke.

1:19:42.734 --> 1:19:44.066
Yeah.

1:19:44.066 --> 1:19:45.433
It was hard won, man.

1:19:45.433 --> 1:19:47.767
I even made enough
to get Steve paid something.

1:19:47.767 --> 1:19:49.367
And that feels good
because he hasn't made

1:19:49.367 --> 1:19:50.834
any money this summer at all.

1:19:50.834 --> 1:19:53.367
It was really nice to see him
get a little bit of gold.

1:19:56.533 --> 1:19:58.467
Finally filling up
this bottle.

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:02.867
It's an actually little pile
of gold right there.

1:20:06.266 --> 1:20:08.100
On the other side
of town...

1:20:17.634 --> 1:20:20.300
That stuff
looks really good.

1:20:20.300 --> 1:20:23.400
Mr. Gold is hoping
to score a direct hit.

1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:25.000
There it is.

1:20:26.333 --> 1:20:29.300
Gold mining has lots of highs
and lots of lows.

1:20:29.300 --> 1:20:31.200
Fist fights with the Kellys
one minute,

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:34.500
making peace the next,
great gold, one minute.

1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:36.567
Broken spud well the next.

1:20:36.567 --> 1:20:39.200
But the bottom line is,
we might be

1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:41.533
on the best pay streak
of the season.

1:20:41.533 --> 1:20:43.600
And ultimately,
that's all it matters.

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:47.367
Let's weigh up this,
Myrtle gold.

1:20:48.734 --> 1:20:50.533
Here we go. Here we go.

1:20:53.533 --> 1:20:57.700
There's 20, 40, 50.

1:20:59.033 --> 1:21:00.400
70.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.000
Come on,
let's hit triple digits.

1:21:05.734 --> 1:21:07.433
Cool. Hundred.

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.700
148.

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:16.867
We got good gold,
but this spud well
took us off the water.

1:21:16.867 --> 1:21:19.767
Hopefully we can get back
out there.

1:21:19.767 --> 1:21:25.734
148.3 ounces
is worth over 266 grand.

1:21:25.734 --> 1:21:29.834
And Mr. Gold is once again
living up to his name.

1:21:29.834 --> 1:21:33.300
Kelly's definitely
cost us time, cost us money.

1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:34.433
Piss you off.

1:21:34.433 --> 1:21:36.500
Every minute,
you're not digging.

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:39.433
And I'm dealing
with those idiots.

1:21:39.433 --> 1:21:42.600
It's costing me money.
It's costing my guys money.

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.133
It's costing everybody money.

1:21:44.133 --> 1:21:45.867
Other than that,
we're doing well.

1:21:45.867 --> 1:21:47.734
Look at it.
We got a pile of gold.

1:21:48.967 --> 1:21:50.800
Even though the Myrtle
hasn't been out there

1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:52.934
every minute
that I'd hope for.

1:21:52.934 --> 1:21:54.934
When it is, it's money
in the bank.

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:59.700
We just need to keep
the Myrtle healthy
for the rest of the season.

1:21:59.700 --> 1:22:04.634
And if we do with the Myrtle,
the Inland mine
and the Christine Rose,

1:22:04.634 --> 1:22:07.166
we're gonna hit
our 3,000 ounces gold.

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:09.800
We're on hot ground right now.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:12.800
You got to get down there
and pile up the gold.

1:22:14.166 --> 1:22:17.166
That's all we need.
We need days on the water.

1:22:17.166 --> 1:22:19.000
Happy. Happy.

1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:26.066
Sean makes
a giant move,

1:22:26.066 --> 1:22:29.333
while Emily and Zeke
make some noise of their own.

1:22:30.967 --> 1:22:33.800
Next time
on Bering Sea gold...

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:35.200
Starting to get cold.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:36.700
We're gonna have
to fight through it.

1:22:36.700 --> 1:22:39.100
We don't have a whole lot
of mining days left.

1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:43.066
You need to get as much gold
as we can
in little time we got.

1:22:43.066 --> 1:22:45.567
Myrtle's back up
and running, baby.

1:22:45.567 --> 1:22:48.066
Now if I can just keep
this thing digging.

1:22:48.066 --> 1:22:50.500
She's gonna give out
a good bounty.

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:52.967
Kris is back,
just like the good old days.

1:22:56.567 --> 1:22:58.533
The back anchor
is not catching
on anything.

1:22:58.533 --> 1:23:00.400
, yeah.

1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:02.166
This weather
is not joking around.

1:23:02.166 --> 1:23:03.367
Oh.

1:23:03.367 --> 1:23:04.767
Ah.

1:23:04.767 --> 1:23:06.033
We got to get out of here.

1:23:06.033 --> 1:23:08.300
Today is the first day
without Vernon.

1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:12.867
Oh, no, no.

1:23:12.867 --> 1:23:14.200
Let her rip!

1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:15.433
You see some gold there?

1:23:19.233 --> 1:23:20.667
We have white gold
in the box.

1:23:20.667 --> 1:23:21.934
We're on gold.

1:23:21.934 --> 1:23:23.066
Looks really good.

1:23:23.066 --> 1:23:25.000
Dead presidents
you know what I talking about?

1:23:26.166 --> 1:23:27.533
Money.
