01:34.797 --> 01:36.265
- Don't move!
- Aah!

01:37.717 --> 01:39.560
- Gee!
- Charlie!

01:39.635 --> 01:41.228
What the hell are you doing?

01:41.429 --> 01:42.406
What the hell am I doing?

01:42.430 --> 01:44.565
What the hell are you doing
sneaking around the house?

01:45.683 --> 01:47.359
I forgot my keys, okay?

01:47.685 --> 01:49.361
Put down the knife, you idiot.

01:50.479 --> 01:51.623
It's three o'clock
in the morning.

01:51.647 --> 01:53.115
What the hell's going on?

01:53.482 --> 01:54.700
Nothing.

01:55.818 --> 01:57.453
Well, where have you been?

01:57.945 --> 01:59.747
- Out.
- Out where?

02:01.323 --> 02:02.300
Come on, Charlie.

02:02.324 --> 02:03.552
For the last, like, two weeks,

02:03.576 --> 02:04.928
I've been hearing you
come home every night

02:04.952 --> 02:06.263
at God knows what hour.

02:06.287 --> 02:07.973
You know, that's funny, 'cause
the last time I checked,

02:07.997 --> 02:09.340
I didn't have a curfew.

02:09.372 --> 02:10.475
Well, what... What
are you doing?

02:10.499 --> 02:13.552
You hanging out with a
group of guys after work?

02:14.754 --> 02:16.273
Are you seeing some new girl?

02:16.297 --> 02:17.556
You know what?

02:17.715 --> 02:18.942
I'm a whole lot older
than you are, Bay.

02:18.966 --> 02:20.225
I don't have to answer to you.

02:21.052 --> 02:23.354
You want to check on bedtimes,
check on Claudia's.

02:23.679 --> 02:24.980
Now go to bed.

02:25.556 --> 02:27.274
Something going on
with you, Charlie?

02:27.475 --> 02:28.650
Go to bed.

Claud, get off the phone.

03:19.652 --> 03:21.578
You're really
screwing me up here.

03:21.612 --> 03:23.247
There's a pay phone
on the corner.

03:23.572 --> 03:25.374
Hi, Artie. Guess who this is.

03:25.449 --> 03:27.135
Listen, that new
diaper rash ointment

03:27.159 --> 03:28.887
you got, it doesn't work great,

03:28.911 --> 03:30.055
so just stick with
the old stuff.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.380
Okay.

03:31.705 --> 03:34.842
So, uh, how long do you
think this is gonna take?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.895
Well, they say the chances of
actually getting on a jury

03:36.919 --> 03:38.355
are really small.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.981
I hear if you don't get
picked in the first few days,

03:40.005 --> 03:41.348
they just dismiss you.

03:41.841 --> 03:43.142
Look, I'll be in touch.

03:45.261 --> 03:46.238
What's going on?

03:46.262 --> 03:48.740
Claudia's in the middle of some
fourth grade gang initiation.

03:48.764 --> 03:49.699
Fifth grade.

03:49.723 --> 03:51.942
So, Artie-chokes,
three for a dollar...

03:52.434 --> 03:54.236
- Sorry, Donna.
- Dana.

03:54.395 --> 03:56.405
Aren't you supposed to be
at a lesson right now?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.031
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

03:58.399 --> 03:59.459
Homework?

03:59.483 --> 04:01.336
Two days off for a
teacher conference.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.828
Don't you listen to anything?

04:02.945 --> 04:04.047
Really...

04:04.071 --> 04:05.966
Claudia will have to call
you right back, Marty.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.259
Artie.

04:07.283 --> 04:08.625
Come on.

04:08.659 --> 04:09.719
Kate is waiting for my call.

04:09.743 --> 04:11.253
There's a pay phone
on the corner.

04:13.789 --> 04:16.425
The guy was there all night.
Left me $2.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.010
- You're kidding.
- Loren.

04:18.377 --> 04:20.095
Owner alert, nine o'clock.

04:22.173 --> 04:23.608
He got a haircut.

04:23.632 --> 04:25.017
That's a new jacket.

04:25.968 --> 04:28.270
You keeping tabs on him or what?

04:28.304 --> 04:29.480
No.

04:30.472 --> 04:31.899
- Maybe.
- Yes.

04:32.016 --> 04:33.192
Julia...

04:33.726 --> 04:35.287
Forget it. He doesn't
know I'm alive.

04:35.311 --> 04:37.029
I bet he doesn't
even know my name.

04:37.730 --> 04:38.947
Hey, Julia,

04:39.190 --> 04:41.116
can I get a glass
of Perrier, please?

04:43.527 --> 04:44.661
Pay up.

04:50.117 --> 04:51.543
On the house.

04:51.619 --> 04:53.587
I don't know if the
house can afford it.

04:54.663 --> 04:55.599
Really?

04:55.623 --> 04:58.383
We're not exactly packing
them in these days, are we?

04:59.210 --> 05:00.636
You want my advice?

05:01.420 --> 05:02.846
Okay.

05:05.382 --> 05:09.070
Well, the same 15 local bands
go from club to club, right?

05:09.094 --> 05:10.030
Right.

05:10.054 --> 05:12.157
Well, maybe if you
paid travel expenses,

05:12.181 --> 05:13.783
rented an apartment
for out-of-town acts,

05:13.807 --> 05:16.985
you could get a reputation for
introducing new groups to the area.

05:17.645 --> 05:19.831
See, the thing is, I
need a consistent draw.

05:19.855 --> 05:23.158
I need a reason for people to come here
every week, no matter who's playing.

05:23.442 --> 05:26.036
Something in the order
of a, I don't know...

05:26.695 --> 05:28.121
wet t-shirt contest.

05:30.241 --> 05:31.676
- You're kidding, right?
- No, no, I'm not.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.553
I got every penny I ever made
tied up into this place.

05:33.577 --> 05:35.170
I'm up to my eyes in debt.

05:35.537 --> 05:37.381
You gotta to have a cash
register for a heart.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.770
Well, uh, in that case, I guess you
want me back on the job, right?

05:41.794 --> 05:44.388
You know, Loren tells
me that you're good.

05:46.006 --> 05:46.983
You've asked?

05:47.007 --> 05:49.559
Well, he just says that you
may be the best we have.

05:51.428 --> 05:52.980
Wait a second.

05:53.472 --> 05:55.857
How come nobody here has
got your phone number?

05:56.475 --> 05:58.110
How come you looked?

06:05.275 --> 06:07.411
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

06:08.237 --> 06:10.131

06:10.155 --> 06:12.332

06:15.619 --> 06:16.962
Pizza?

06:17.162 --> 06:19.432
No. Mrs. Gideon.

06:19.456 --> 06:20.632
Who?

06:20.666 --> 06:23.468
From the Department
of Social Services.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.073
Uh, I'm coming.

06:35.097 --> 06:36.648
I'll be there in a second.

06:47.401 --> 06:48.952
Mrs. Gideon. Hi.

06:49.153 --> 06:50.213
Bailey.

06:50.237 --> 06:52.039
May I come in?

06:54.199 --> 06:57.252
Don't think too long. It's
a rhetorical question.

07:12.801 --> 07:15.020
I, uh, I forgot we
had an appointment.

07:15.846 --> 07:18.774
You know how we work.
No appointments.

07:20.184 --> 07:21.661
I'm sorry for the
late hour, though,

07:21.685 --> 07:24.164
but I figured with
your brother working

07:24.188 --> 07:26.156
and you kids in school...

07:27.066 --> 07:29.002
well, the evening seemed
like the best time

07:29.026 --> 07:30.827
to catch you all together.

07:30.903 --> 07:33.330
Oh, well, we're never out
of each other's sight...

07:35.616 --> 07:37.042
except for tonight.

07:39.036 --> 07:40.253
Any guess?

07:40.662 --> 07:43.173
My bet is it ain't a raise.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.134
Oh.

07:46.835 --> 07:50.440
Jeez, I didn't mean to keep
everybody in suspense.

07:50.464 --> 07:52.474
I got stuck in the bathroom.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.028
Loren, you want to do something
about that door, please?

07:55.052 --> 07:56.529
Oh, yeah, I'm working
on that, boss.

07:56.553 --> 07:58.114
Thank you. Thank you.

07:58.138 --> 07:59.481
Uh, listen, uh...

07:59.681 --> 08:00.992
I know we haven't been exactly

08:01.016 --> 08:02.619
packing them in here
the past few weeks,

08:02.643 --> 08:04.528
so this is what I was thinking.

08:05.229 --> 08:06.498
We'll let the customers know

08:06.522 --> 08:09.032
that, uh, the music's
not the only draw.

08:09.483 --> 08:10.742
You guys are.

08:11.485 --> 08:14.246
So, starting tomorrow, there's
going to be a new dress code.

08:14.780 --> 08:16.206
What, wet t-shirts?

08:16.740 --> 08:18.500
Let's just say that it, uh...

08:18.700 --> 08:20.544
it's a figure-flattering
uniform.

08:20.577 --> 08:22.055
I think we show a little
more skin around here,

08:22.079 --> 08:23.306
we'll show a little more profit.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.557
Uh-huh. You know, like I say,

08:24.581 --> 08:27.217
when in doubt, capitalize
on your asses.

08:28.877 --> 08:30.345
Is that what you're doing?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.899
Anyway, I've got a whole
crate coming in later,

08:32.923 --> 08:35.558
so, uh, you know, pick out
your sizes, try them on,

08:35.717 --> 08:38.602
and, uh, that's it.

08:39.011 --> 08:40.313
End of announcement.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.065
Wasn't so bad, was it?

08:44.309 --> 08:46.236
How's Mrs. Kelleher doing?

08:47.271 --> 08:48.822
The, uh... The nanny.

08:49.523 --> 08:52.075
She... She had to leave.

08:53.068 --> 08:54.494
She left.

08:57.114 --> 08:59.583
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

09:00.242 --> 09:01.886
I have that noted right here.

09:01.910 --> 09:03.170
You hired...

09:03.579 --> 09:05.464
Kirsten Bennett is her name?

09:10.002 --> 09:11.428
Julia!

09:12.045 --> 09:14.181
You, uh, you remember...

09:15.507 --> 09:17.434
Mrs. Gideon, what
are you doing here?

09:18.635 --> 09:20.113
It's all right. It's
our regular visit.

09:20.137 --> 09:22.731
That's great. Nice to see you.

09:22.848 --> 09:24.534
Same here. Look, I'd like to...

09:24.558 --> 09:25.785
I got to go to the bathroom.

09:25.809 --> 09:28.111
- Julia!
- I'm going to explode.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.115
She got her mom's bladder.

09:33.358 --> 09:35.295
You know, why don't I call
Charlie at the restaurant

09:35.319 --> 09:37.037
and see what time he'll
be home from work?

09:46.830 --> 09:48.173
Oh, God!

09:54.880 --> 09:56.649
Joe. Hey. Hey. Can I, uh...

09:56.673 --> 09:58.391
Can I talk to Charlie
for a second?

10:00.511 --> 10:01.728
What?

10:02.137 --> 10:03.730
No, no, no. I thought he said...

10:05.807 --> 10:08.161
Okay, well, all right.
Well, thanks, Joe. Just...

10:08.185 --> 10:10.111
Just, uh, let him know I called.

10:10.354 --> 10:11.655
All right, thanks.

10:12.981 --> 10:15.700
He, uh, just stepped
out on a break.

10:16.902 --> 10:18.286
It happens.

10:19.071 --> 10:20.705
It is such a weird night.

10:20.906 --> 10:23.551
Usually, we're all gathered
around the living room together,

10:23.575 --> 10:25.877
you know, studying and talking.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.548
Why don't I see how
Julia's doing?

10:32.626 --> 10:33.844
Julia!

10:34.336 --> 10:35.762
Just a minute!

10:36.129 --> 10:37.848
For God's sakes. Julia...

10:38.423 --> 10:39.400
Hi.

10:39.424 --> 10:41.852
Hi, there... again. Um...

10:42.302 --> 10:44.145
I was just changing.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.283
We were doing a production
of <i>Marat/Sade</i> at the school.

10:47.307 --> 10:48.733
Church.

10:49.142 --> 10:50.203
Church school.

10:50.227 --> 10:51.913
It's a benefit,
actually, for hunger...

10:51.937 --> 10:53.081
Disease.

10:53.105 --> 10:54.040
And diseases.

10:54.064 --> 10:56.000
Hunger and diseases.
It's very optimistic.

10:56.024 --> 10:57.617
Let me get a sweater.

11:00.612 --> 11:01.923
You know what?

11:01.947 --> 11:03.415
I bet you'd like to see Claudia.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.083
I would, yes.

11:05.117 --> 11:06.970
You know, she, uh...
She recently performed

11:06.994 --> 11:08.721
with the Bay Area
Chamber Ensemble.

11:08.745 --> 11:10.557
- It was in the paper.
- I saw that.

11:10.581 --> 11:13.550
Yeah, she's, she's a credit to
us all and to your department.

11:16.837 --> 11:18.314
She, uh, she might be sleeping.

11:18.338 --> 11:20.348
You know, all that
practicing and studying.

11:21.174 --> 11:22.559
Claudia?

11:23.885 --> 11:25.353
Claudia?

11:26.847 --> 11:28.315
Claudia?

11:29.016 --> 11:30.483
Claudia?

11:31.018 --> 11:32.861
It's 10 o'clock at night.

11:33.603 --> 11:36.448
You know what? She's
out with Charlie.

11:36.606 --> 11:38.251
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.535
The two of them are spending
some time together.

11:42.362 --> 11:44.748
So is there anything
else you want to see?

11:45.490 --> 11:47.167
I think I've seen enough.

11:54.666 --> 11:56.019
She's got to be with friends.

11:56.043 --> 11:57.510
At 10:30 at night?

12:00.547 --> 12:01.806
What are you guys doing?

12:01.965 --> 12:04.392
And what are you wearing
underneath that sweater, Jule?

12:04.593 --> 12:07.238
- Claudia's missing.
- What?

12:07.262 --> 12:08.781
She's gone. We can't find her.

12:08.805 --> 12:09.991
Where have you been?

12:10.015 --> 12:12.067
- I was at work.
- Oh, really?

12:12.642 --> 12:13.703
There must be a note somewhere.

12:13.727 --> 12:14.787
Well, we can't find one

12:14.811 --> 12:16.581
and no one has seen her
since this afternoon.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.990
Yeah, it was, like,
eight hours ago.

12:19.524 --> 12:21.242
Did she tell you
she was going out?

12:21.526 --> 12:24.329
No. I don't know.
I don't think so.

12:26.198 --> 12:28.249
Well, she's got to be
with friends, right?

12:28.575 --> 12:31.169
I mean, she's got to be. It's the
only thing that makes sense.

12:34.289 --> 12:35.924
We have no idea, do we?

12:47.177 --> 12:48.571
She comes up to about here.

12:48.595 --> 12:50.397
What's this, like four feet?

12:50.764 --> 12:51.940
Her weight?

12:53.934 --> 12:55.328
What do 11-year-olds weigh?

12:55.352 --> 12:56.861
She's pretty average.

12:57.187 --> 12:59.082
- What was she wearing the last
time you saw her? -A dress.

12:59.106 --> 13:00.365
- Jeans.
- Overalls.

13:02.317 --> 13:03.993
You're not exactly sure
what she was wearing?

13:04.653 --> 13:05.870
I guess not.

13:06.071 --> 13:08.216
You wouldn't happen to have a
recent picture of her, would you?

13:08.240 --> 13:09.416
Um...

13:14.371 --> 13:16.256
This is from last year...

13:17.249 --> 13:18.925
or maybe the year before.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.635
Her bangs are longer.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.273
I'm going to put out a
missing juvenile broadcast.

13:24.297 --> 13:26.901
What should we do? Drive
around looking for her?

13:26.925 --> 13:28.986
No, really, the best
thing for you to do

13:29.010 --> 13:30.988
is to rack your brains
as to where she might be

13:31.012 --> 13:33.231
and wait by the phone.

13:33.306 --> 13:35.233
Just need a signature here.

13:39.855 --> 13:42.240
What's this? Why would you need
to know the name of her dentist?

13:43.233 --> 13:45.744
It's for purposes
of identification.

13:46.278 --> 13:48.747
Hopefully, we'll never
have to deal with that.

13:53.785 --> 13:55.003
Anything?

13:55.078 --> 13:56.264
Sheet music,

13:56.288 --> 13:58.506
art project of sea shells,

13:59.499 --> 14:01.602
list of what she wants
for her birthday.

14:01.626 --> 14:04.647
Doesn't she have, like, a
little phone book or something?

14:04.671 --> 14:05.648
Phone number!

14:05.672 --> 14:06.890
Phone number.

14:06.923 --> 14:08.975
It's my handwriting.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.988
What did you take $400
out of the bank for?

14:12.012 --> 14:13.114
What?

14:13.138 --> 14:15.825
It's an ATM slip from,
from three days ago.

14:15.849 --> 14:16.993
Yeah, great.

14:17.017 --> 14:18.744
I just don't remember
it in the checkbook.

14:18.768 --> 14:20.945
For God's sake, Bay, do we have
to deal with this right now?

14:24.357 --> 14:25.418
I don't know, Bay.

14:25.442 --> 14:28.161
Maybe he's got a girlfriend he
doesn't want us to know about.

14:32.199 --> 14:33.583
"Dear Diary."

14:35.452 --> 14:37.003
Kind of a trust issue here, huh?

14:37.913 --> 14:39.589
It could have friends'
phone numbers in it.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.509
Use a bobby pin or something.
She'll never know.

14:44.628 --> 14:47.722
The thing is, Jule, he's
tired all the time.

14:47.923 --> 14:49.192
His eyes are always red.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.777
What are you saying?

14:50.801 --> 14:52.361
Charlie's got a drug
problem or something?

14:52.385 --> 14:53.812
Give me a break.

14:54.805 --> 14:56.064
Got it.

15:00.977 --> 15:03.196
"I kind of like our new nanny.

15:03.563 --> 15:06.334
"Owen almost took a step today
without even holding on."

15:06.358 --> 15:07.992
Wow. Did you know that?

15:08.026 --> 15:09.536
No.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.715
"Julia's weird. Today I saw
her..." Never mind. Um...

15:12.739 --> 15:15.125
"Bart likes Jamie.
Karen likes Jimmy S.

15:15.617 --> 15:17.836
Question mark likes Claudia."

15:18.537 --> 15:20.380
And that's it.

15:20.747 --> 15:23.726
Great. We've got nothing.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.354
Maybe one of us needs some rest.

15:26.378 --> 15:29.690
Wait a second. What about this
whole thing with Charlie?

15:29.714 --> 15:30.775
Bailey, come on.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.068
No, I'm telling you,

15:32.092 --> 15:33.560
it's like he's got
this secret life.

15:34.219 --> 15:36.072
- Leave it alone, Bay.
- What?

15:36.096 --> 15:38.690
People are allowed their
privacy, you know.

15:40.225 --> 15:42.245
That's a great answer, Jule.
That's great.

15:42.269 --> 15:45.039
You know... You know, I think
we've gone a little overboard

15:45.063 --> 15:46.040
with the privacy thing here.

15:46.064 --> 15:47.458
I mean, one of us is missing,

15:47.482 --> 15:48.751
and none of us has any idea

15:48.775 --> 15:50.577
what anyone else in
this family is doing.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.298
Claudia.

15:54.322 --> 15:55.665
Claudia.

16:04.332 --> 16:06.551
What? What? Claudia!

16:09.337 --> 16:11.014
Something going
on with you guys?

16:11.548 --> 16:13.526
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

16:13.550 --> 16:14.527
I'm fine.

16:14.551 --> 16:16.227
Where have you been all night?

16:16.261 --> 16:18.313
I was at a sleep-over
at Dana's...

16:19.264 --> 16:20.533
and I met this boy.

16:20.557 --> 16:21.868
You what?

16:21.892 --> 16:23.286
I know. Isn't it great?

16:23.310 --> 16:25.361
You were at a sleep-over
and you didn't call?

16:25.937 --> 16:27.540
What? Why should I call?

16:27.564 --> 16:29.041
Because we all nearly
had heart attacks

16:29.065 --> 16:30.293
when you didn't come
home, that's why.

16:30.317 --> 16:32.378
We were up all night. We thought
you were missing or dead.

16:32.402 --> 16:33.786
We called the police.

16:34.195 --> 16:35.955
Well, that was pretty stupid.

16:35.989 --> 16:37.248
Stupid?

16:37.574 --> 16:39.876
Don't you ever do
that to us again.

16:40.035 --> 16:42.305
Hey, I told you
where I was going.

16:42.329 --> 16:43.472
You told who?

16:43.496 --> 16:46.142
I yelled through the bathroom
door when you wouldn't open it.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.518
You said okay.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.396
I know you didn't hear me, because
you had those stupid headphones on,

16:50.420 --> 16:52.356
so I went to you while you
were in the living room.

16:52.380 --> 16:53.723
You nodded.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.101
I was asleep.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.406
If you were all so
worried about me,

17:00.430 --> 17:02.607
why didn't you just look
up Dana's parents' number?

17:02.891 --> 17:04.733
It's in the phone book...

17:05.352 --> 17:08.570
unless it's because you have
no idea what Dana's name is,

17:08.688 --> 17:10.665
which wouldn't
surprise me at all,

17:10.690 --> 17:12.501
because none of you care
about any of my friends

17:12.525 --> 17:14.577
or have the slightest clue
what's going on in my life.

17:14.944 --> 17:17.423
You want to blame someone for this?
Blame yourselves.

17:17.446 --> 17:20.415
I'm growing up, and
I'm becoming a woman,

17:20.617 --> 17:21.792
and you're all missing it.

17:25.955 --> 17:29.050
So what do you think? Should
we hug her or kill her?

17:30.543 --> 17:31.844
Kind of a toss-up.

17:33.588 --> 17:35.390
<i>We'll be back in 20,
so stick around.</i>

17:35.966 --> 17:38.486
- I feel like a hooker.
- I feel like a sausage casing.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.529
It took me 45 minutes
to get dressed.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.021
Put that on your time card.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.525
Here we go again.

17:50.105 --> 17:51.666
What are you having?

17:51.690 --> 17:52.865
A fantasy.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.086
What can I get you?

17:55.110 --> 17:56.587
How about your phone number?

17:56.611 --> 17:58.997
What would you like
beverage-wise?

17:59.698 --> 18:01.666
Why don't you use
your imagination?

18:02.075 --> 18:04.002
Because mine's working overtime.

18:11.751 --> 18:12.853
This is bull.

18:12.877 --> 18:14.929
All right, Julia. Go, girl.

18:16.089 --> 18:18.609
Okay, so what have we got here?
Four pinched butts...

18:18.633 --> 18:19.652
Five.

18:19.676 --> 18:20.653
Five. Sorry, Molly.

18:20.677 --> 18:23.072
Three lewd comments and
two sexual propositions?

18:23.096 --> 18:25.315
And a partridge in a pear tree.

18:25.598 --> 18:27.692
We didn't get shut down by
the fire marshal, did we?

18:27.976 --> 18:29.527
What the hell's going on?

18:30.228 --> 18:32.081
Look, we're not trying
to be difficult,

18:32.105 --> 18:34.741
but, uh, these uniforms...

18:35.191 --> 18:36.909
we kind of don't
want to wear them.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.786
- No?
- No.

18:39.529 --> 18:41.882
I know you're trying to find
a way to reel in customers,

18:41.906 --> 18:43.175
and we all understand that,

18:43.199 --> 18:45.084
but I don't think we're
comfortable being the bait.

18:45.201 --> 18:46.679
Ah. So to speak.

18:46.703 --> 18:49.598
So, maybe we can come up
with a different solution,

18:49.622 --> 18:51.100
because this one
isn't gonna work.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.843
I see, I see, and you're
all agreed on this?

18:54.002 --> 18:54.979
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.304
It's unanimous.

18:56.546 --> 19:00.266
Okay, okay, well, then,
uh, you're all fired.

19:02.177 --> 19:03.320
What?

19:03.344 --> 19:05.396
Are you kidding me? I
can't believe this.

19:26.451 --> 19:28.429
Bailey...

19:28.453 --> 19:30.213
I don't believe this.
You followed me.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.058
What are you doing in Berkeley?

19:32.082 --> 19:33.559
You have lost your mind.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.519
Look, I want to know what is
going on with you, Charlie.

19:35.543 --> 19:36.729
I want to know where
you go at night.

19:36.753 --> 19:38.481
It's none of your damn business.

19:38.505 --> 19:39.607
Yes, it is my business.

19:39.631 --> 19:41.849
It's my business when you
lie about being at work

19:41.883 --> 19:43.652
and you come home at three
o'clock in the morning

19:43.676 --> 19:45.686
and you can't explain what
you did with 400 bucks.

19:46.262 --> 19:48.523
Now, what is going on
with you, Charlie?

19:48.556 --> 19:50.316
Are you in some kind of trouble?

19:51.935 --> 19:53.694
It's drugs, isn't it?

19:54.312 --> 19:57.323
- What? -I know they sell
the stuff around campus.

19:57.524 --> 19:59.585
Yeah, that's it, Bailey.
You caught me.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.087
When I'm not at home
changing diapers,

20:01.111 --> 20:02.713
I'm out on Telegraph
Avenue dealing dope.

20:02.737 --> 20:04.256
All right, well, if it's
not that, then what?

20:04.280 --> 20:06.457
Get the hell out
of here, Bailey!

20:07.742 --> 20:09.335
Charlie...

20:12.956 --> 20:14.350
<i>Hey, you've reached
the Salingers.</i>

20:14.374 --> 20:15.883
<i>We're not around. You
know what to do.</i>

20:16.709 --> 20:18.938
<i>Yes, this is Jane Gideon.</i>

20:18.962 --> 20:21.065
<i>I've scheduled a
follow-up visit with you</i>

20:21.089 --> 20:23.567
<i>for tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.</i>

20:23.591 --> 20:25.653
<i>Unless I hear to the contrary,</i>

20:25.677 --> 20:27.571
<i>I'll expect to see
all of you there.</i>

20:27.595 --> 20:28.697
<i>All of you.</i>

20:28.721 --> 20:30.064
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:53.079 --> 20:55.015
There was a message
on the machine.

20:55.039 --> 20:56.725
She's coming back. Mrs. Gideon.

20:56.749 --> 20:57.967
And she wants to see us.

20:58.168 --> 20:59.302
All of us.

20:59.335 --> 21:02.221
Probably because she thinks things
are falling apart around here,

21:03.089 --> 21:04.441
and she's right.

21:04.465 --> 21:06.017
What, now you've
got her involved?

21:06.134 --> 21:09.520
Look, I didn't want to, but with a
social worker breathing down our necks,

21:10.305 --> 21:12.523
you're just gonna have to
level with us here, Charlie.

21:15.435 --> 21:17.153
I'm going to school, okay?

21:18.813 --> 21:20.708
I'm taking an architecture
class at Berkeley.

21:20.732 --> 21:22.533
I've been at the
library every night.

21:23.651 --> 21:25.578
Right. Tell me another one.

21:27.322 --> 21:28.591
Architecture 134,

21:28.615 --> 21:31.292
Professor Eric Dwight,
Seaton Hall, Room 306.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.469
You're serious.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.387
Yeah.

21:45.006 --> 21:46.233
So the 400 bucks...

21:46.257 --> 21:48.601
Tuition, course fees, textbooks.

21:49.719 --> 21:51.896
God, Charlie, that's great.

21:52.513 --> 21:55.024
I mean, it's great that
you're trying this again.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.953
Well, it's not for a
grade or anything.

21:57.977 --> 21:59.121
It's just pass/fail.

21:59.145 --> 22:00.372
So what?

22:00.396 --> 22:02.406
It's a start, right? It's great.

22:03.358 --> 22:05.076
So why was this
such a big secret?

22:06.319 --> 22:08.079
I just didn't want
anyone to know.

22:08.613 --> 22:09.747
Why?

22:11.699 --> 22:13.751
I just didn't, okay?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.920
You don't need to
know everything.

22:19.707 --> 22:21.092
Best friend?

22:21.376 --> 22:22.686
Dana Shepherd.

22:22.710 --> 22:23.928
That's E-R-D.

22:24.003 --> 22:25.397
Used to be Jill Thorton

22:25.421 --> 22:27.390
until she cheated off me
during a spelling test.

22:27.507 --> 22:28.651
Favorite teacher?

22:28.675 --> 22:31.737
I can't believe Mrs. Gideon's
gonna want to know this stuff.

22:31.761 --> 22:33.864
It's not just for her.
We want to know.

22:33.888 --> 22:34.907
Favorite teacher?

22:34.931 --> 22:36.148
Mrs. Carver.

22:36.432 --> 22:37.326
Wears Reeboks,

22:37.350 --> 22:39.036
cries when she reads
us Johnny Tremain,

22:39.060 --> 22:41.028
puts on too much blush.

22:42.105 --> 22:43.489
Favorite scotch?

22:47.068 --> 22:48.286
Main squeeze?

22:49.028 --> 22:50.714
Come on, Claud. Who's the kid
you were on the phone with

22:50.738 --> 22:52.549
the other day, acting
like a total idiot?

22:52.573 --> 22:54.542
Yeah. Arnie someone.

22:54.742 --> 22:56.085
Artie.

22:56.744 --> 22:57.920
Artie.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.265
Spill the beans, Claudia.
We want to know everything.

23:00.289 --> 23:01.632
Everything.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.175
Well, he's...

23:04.252 --> 23:05.761
He's very tall.

23:05.878 --> 23:07.096
Six feet?

23:08.089 --> 23:09.473
Taller than me.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.986
Hobbies? Special skills?

23:12.010 --> 23:13.561
He plays the cymbals...

23:13.594 --> 23:14.655
Cymbals.

23:14.679 --> 23:16.949
And he can wiggle his
ears one at a time.

23:16.973 --> 23:18.742
I don't know anybody
else who can do that.

23:18.766 --> 23:20.568
One at a time.

23:21.644 --> 23:22.663
Hmm.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.155
You can see for yourself.

23:24.772 --> 23:25.990
Today.

23:26.065 --> 23:27.533
We have a date.

23:29.110 --> 23:30.453
Date?

23:33.239 --> 23:34.133
Okay,

23:34.157 --> 23:36.218
so our ever eloquent Mr. Ponti

23:36.242 --> 23:38.762
thinks that the architect's
use of materials...

23:38.786 --> 23:40.180
How did you phrase that?

23:40.204 --> 23:41.464
"Blows"?

23:42.665 --> 23:45.634
Well, is there anything
else we can say about this?

23:47.003 --> 23:48.346
Huh? Anyone?

23:50.965 --> 23:52.224
Yes.

23:53.051 --> 23:54.643
The proportions are totally off.

23:54.886 --> 23:57.438
I mean, the scale totally
overpowers the site.

23:57.555 --> 23:59.199
It's like the architect
designed a building

23:59.223 --> 24:01.442
without giving thought to where
the building was going to go.

24:01.476 --> 24:04.653
Can everyone see that?
Excellent.

24:04.937 --> 24:05.914
A good architect

24:05.938 --> 24:09.626
must live, sleep,
eat, breathe his site

24:09.650 --> 24:12.286
before he ever puts
drafting pencil to paper,

24:12.737 --> 24:16.216
which is why we're going to
have an all-day site visit

24:16.240 --> 24:17.500
this Friday.

24:17.617 --> 24:19.219
Now, I'm gonna be giving
instruction there,

24:19.243 --> 24:20.596
so attendance is required,

24:20.620 --> 24:22.973
and, at the conclusion
of our field trip,

24:22.997 --> 24:24.600
I'm gonna be assigning you

24:24.624 --> 24:26.185
a 48-hour sketch problem,

24:26.209 --> 24:28.020
so clear your calendars
for the weekend.

24:28.044 --> 24:29.480
You're going to need
every single second.

24:29.504 --> 24:31.180
No extensions on that.

24:31.380 --> 24:34.183
I want to see how you folks
work with deadlines, okay?

24:34.383 --> 24:36.185
So let's move on
to the next one.

24:37.470 --> 24:39.021
Think she'll look in the fridge?

24:39.055 --> 24:40.564
She might. Good thinking.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.901
Yuck!

24:44.977 --> 24:46.654
Better make a shopping list.

24:46.729 --> 24:47.915
Lots of, uh...

24:47.939 --> 24:48.999
fresh fruit.

24:49.023 --> 24:50.741
Maybe a chicken or something,

24:50.817 --> 24:52.878
and we've got to lose
all the sugar cereals.

24:52.902 --> 24:54.505
Oh, man, Bill, you're back.

24:54.529 --> 24:57.164
Ah, thank God. We're kind of in
social service hell right now.

24:57.323 --> 24:58.958
We're short one nanny.

24:59.158 --> 25:01.553
...Boy, we really need your help.

25:01.577 --> 25:04.088
Actually, uh, guys...

25:04.997 --> 25:06.132
I got picked.

25:06.958 --> 25:08.384
You know, to serve.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.761
You've been drafted?

25:11.087 --> 25:12.314
On a jury.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.525
- Oh. -You're kidding.
What's the case?

25:14.549 --> 25:16.777
Like, burglary or
assault or something?

25:16.801 --> 25:19.645
Uh, it's, uh, murder...

25:20.221 --> 25:21.480
one.

25:23.432 --> 25:24.952
So I don't suppose
it's very likely

25:24.976 --> 25:28.487
that you'll be back in the
next day or two, then.

25:28.855 --> 25:32.032
I think when they sequester
you, it's a pretty bad sign.

25:35.319 --> 25:38.581
So, you know, the point is, I...

25:40.074 --> 25:42.168
I kind of won't be
keeping in touch.

25:42.910 --> 25:44.253
Bill...

25:44.829 --> 25:46.589
Oh, Bill...

25:47.582 --> 25:48.799
Kirsten!

25:49.458 --> 25:50.686
Bailey?

25:50.710 --> 25:52.261
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:52.336 --> 25:53.772
What are you doing here?

25:53.796 --> 25:56.525
I was just, uh, kind of
in the neighborhood,

25:56.549 --> 25:57.568
so...

25:57.592 --> 25:59.236
Is everyone okay? Owen?

25:59.260 --> 26:01.479
Yeah, he's great. Owen's great.

26:01.596 --> 26:02.948
- Oh! -He's going to
walk any day now.

26:02.972 --> 26:04.440
You should see him.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.734
Yeah, we're all...
we're all okay.

26:07.185 --> 26:08.360
Charlie too.

26:09.478 --> 26:10.998
That's great. That's great.

26:11.022 --> 26:12.791
I've got to get to a seminar,
or I'm gonna be late.

26:12.815 --> 26:14.783
Wait. Kirsten. Hold on a second.
Look...

26:15.943 --> 26:18.245
Look, I know you don't
owe us anything.

26:18.362 --> 26:19.631
I mean, you were great,

26:19.655 --> 26:21.373
and Charlie kind of blew it,

26:21.449 --> 26:22.426
and I can understand

26:22.450 --> 26:24.219
if you just want to forget the
whole thing ever happened,

26:24.243 --> 26:26.180
just pretend like you
never knew our names.

26:26.204 --> 26:29.173
No. It's not like that at all.

26:29.916 --> 26:31.175
It isn't?

26:31.626 --> 26:33.385
Good. Good...

26:33.836 --> 26:36.013
because the thing is, we
really, really need your help.

26:42.595 --> 26:44.480
Well, surprise, surprise.

26:45.097 --> 26:47.024
I'm here for my last check.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.817
Right.

26:48.851 --> 26:50.319
Of course.

26:52.855 --> 26:54.458
You know, a bunch
of the other girls

26:54.482 --> 26:55.834
are coming back to work.

26:55.858 --> 26:57.117
Uniforms and all.

26:57.485 --> 26:58.378
Good for them.

26:58.402 --> 26:59.912
I don't need your
money that bad.

27:00.446 --> 27:01.673
Well, can't you give
me another chance?

27:01.697 --> 27:02.873
To do what?

27:02.990 --> 27:04.426
Come up with some
other great ideas?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.961
Mud wrestling? I don't think so.

27:08.204 --> 27:10.172
Like you said, "Cash
register for a heart."

27:11.457 --> 27:13.810
I don't know where you come
off being so judgmental.

27:13.834 --> 27:15.979
I mean, you really don't
know a damn thing about me.

27:16.003 --> 27:18.440
I know you fired a room full
of women who stood up to you.

27:18.464 --> 27:20.432
That's because I had no choice.

27:20.591 --> 27:22.986
...Listen, this is
a business, okay?

27:23.010 --> 27:24.029
I am two weeks away

27:24.053 --> 27:25.280
from being on the
street with nothing.

27:25.304 --> 27:27.074
No, excuse me, not nothing.

27:27.098 --> 27:29.493
A $10,000 loan and a bankruptcy,

27:29.517 --> 27:32.037
so yeah, I may be looking
at the bottom line,

27:32.061 --> 27:35.040
and I'm sorry if somehow
I disappointed you.

27:35.064 --> 27:37.668
Disappointed me? What do I care?

27:37.692 --> 27:39.326
Like you said, I don't
know you at all.

27:39.694 --> 27:42.913
So run your business however you want.
It's got nothing to do with me.

27:42.947 --> 27:44.415
Ah, Jesus.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.052
Okay.

27:47.076 --> 27:48.335
Okay.

27:50.288 --> 27:51.630
You win.

27:53.040 --> 27:53.934
What?

27:53.958 --> 27:56.093
No more uniforms,

27:56.544 --> 27:57.604
no more mud wrestling,

27:57.628 --> 28:00.514
no more Topless Tuesdays.

28:01.424 --> 28:02.891
Was that an option?

28:04.093 --> 28:07.021
I guess I'll just have to find
another way to keep us in the black.

28:08.764 --> 28:10.024
Why?

28:12.601 --> 28:14.361
Because I don't want you to go.

28:18.858 --> 28:22.337
Kirsten? Really? Just like that
she said she'd help us out?

28:22.361 --> 28:25.132
I mean, did you have to talk her
into it, or did she just...

28:25.156 --> 28:28.042
you know, when you told her about what was
going on with us, did she kind of volunteer?

28:32.330 --> 28:33.505
What?

28:35.207 --> 28:37.176
Why don't you ask what
you really want to know?

28:38.627 --> 28:39.730
And what's that?

28:39.754 --> 28:41.180
Is she still pissed?

28:43.132 --> 28:44.350
Well?

28:46.052 --> 28:47.353
Is she?

28:48.554 --> 28:50.365
I don't know. It's hard to say.

28:50.389 --> 28:51.617
She played it kind of cool,

28:51.641 --> 28:52.868
although she did seem interested

28:52.892 --> 28:54.568
when I told her you were
going back to school.

28:54.685 --> 28:56.362
Wait a sec. You told her?

28:56.854 --> 28:58.280
Yeah. What's the big deal?

28:59.357 --> 29:01.168
I told you I didn't
want anyone to know.

29:01.192 --> 29:02.294
Oh, for God's sake, Charlie,

29:02.318 --> 29:04.338
you're not working
for the KGB here.

29:04.362 --> 29:05.881
I mean, this is a great
thing you're doing.

29:05.905 --> 29:07.456
- You should be proud...
- I'm dropping out.

29:08.616 --> 29:09.792
What?

29:11.077 --> 29:12.294
You are? Why?

29:12.703 --> 29:13.639
Just forget it.

29:13.663 --> 29:15.641
No, I don't want to forget it.
I want you to tell me why.

29:15.665 --> 29:18.092
Because I've got other things
I've got to take care of, okay?

29:19.543 --> 29:21.229
Because I don't have
an entire afternoon

29:21.253 --> 29:23.357
to walk around a construction
site in Union Square.

29:23.381 --> 29:25.567
Because I don't have
48 consecutive hours

29:25.591 --> 29:27.226
to devote to a sketch problem.

29:29.929 --> 29:32.106
Because I've got other
responsibilities.

29:32.890 --> 29:34.701
Well, have you talked to Joe about this?
Because I'm sure...

29:34.725 --> 29:35.859
Forget it.

29:39.397 --> 29:40.781
So that's it, huh?

29:41.732 --> 29:42.992
It's too much work.

29:43.234 --> 29:44.169
It's too hard...

29:44.193 --> 29:46.537
I don't need to hear this
from you, Bay, okay?

29:47.488 --> 29:48.590
See, if you hadn't gone

29:48.614 --> 29:49.758
and stuck your nose
in my business,

29:49.782 --> 29:51.760
if you hadn't opened
your big, damn mouth,

29:51.784 --> 29:53.127
no one would've known.

29:55.079 --> 29:57.099
I could've just quit without
it being one more thing

29:57.123 --> 29:59.550
on the list of things that
I have never finished.

30:05.965 --> 30:08.100
I could've just bagged it.

30:09.218 --> 30:11.645
I wouldn't have owed
anyone any explanation.

30:25.985 --> 30:27.244
Hi, Artie.

30:27.445 --> 30:28.912
Hey, Claudia.

30:30.614 --> 30:32.416
So you ready to go?

30:33.451 --> 30:34.835
Well...

30:38.080 --> 30:39.590
Nice to meet you, Arthur.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.936
We thought we'd take a few
minutes to get introduced

30:42.960 --> 30:44.428
before you kids head out.

30:47.381 --> 30:48.807
I'm sorry.

30:51.969 --> 30:54.480
None of this would have
happened badly for me.

30:56.182 --> 30:57.868
The first 10 minutes of
this movie are no big deal.

30:57.892 --> 30:59.359
You didn't miss much.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.070
Whopper?

31:02.062 --> 31:03.739
Don't mind if I do.

31:03.939 --> 31:05.167
So you're sure we'll be back

31:05.191 --> 31:06.710
in time for Mrs. Gideon?

31:06.734 --> 31:07.878
I checked the schedule.

31:07.902 --> 31:09.912
We just can't stay for
the double feature.

31:10.321 --> 31:11.538
Soda?

31:12.281 --> 31:13.624
Fun, huh?

31:17.828 --> 31:19.254
Excuse me.

31:19.663 --> 31:21.048
Bathroom.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.552
Me too.

31:28.214 --> 31:29.515
Soda?

31:32.885 --> 31:34.311
Sorry about this.

31:35.054 --> 31:36.605
It's just kind of annoying.

31:37.181 --> 31:39.858
I mean, why all the
questions about my parents?

31:40.518 --> 31:42.236
And long-term goals?

31:42.478 --> 31:44.238
What does that have
to do with anything?

31:44.647 --> 31:46.365
And political affiliations?

31:46.857 --> 31:48.659
Come on. Give me a break.

31:49.902 --> 31:51.245
You know what else?

31:51.904 --> 31:54.498
The first 10 minutes of this
movie is the best part.

31:54.907 --> 31:56.667
Maybe I can convince
them to leave.

31:57.701 --> 31:59.002
It's okay.

32:00.037 --> 32:02.005
I kind of think I'm going
to go home anyway.

32:02.498 --> 32:03.799
This is no fun.

32:05.668 --> 32:06.969
See you in school.

32:20.182 --> 32:21.567
You look great.

32:24.520 --> 32:25.539
Hi.

32:25.563 --> 32:28.824
He must've gained five pounds.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.670
Oh, yes. Hi.

32:31.694 --> 32:33.328
I missed you.

32:36.156 --> 32:37.457
I missed you.

32:38.534 --> 32:40.210
It's just a favor, Charlie.

32:40.953 --> 32:42.296
Okay?

32:44.456 --> 32:46.434
I am really sorry about
the other evening.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.520
Things were a little hectic.

32:48.544 --> 32:50.512
What with my play rehearsal.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.984
And with me having to leave the
restaurant to make this delivery.

32:54.008 --> 32:55.318
And with me forgetting
that Claudia was

32:55.342 --> 32:56.611
spending time with Charlie

32:56.635 --> 32:57.696
as a special treat.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.189
I told him. Twice.

33:00.347 --> 33:01.867
She did. She told me.

33:01.891 --> 33:03.650
We're just happy you
could come back.

33:03.934 --> 33:05.777
He just wanted to say
good night to everybody.

33:06.937 --> 33:08.530
- Good night, Owen.
- Night, Owen.

33:09.106 --> 33:11.251
Boy, something sure smells good.

33:11.275 --> 33:13.202
Well, then it's not Owen.

33:14.403 --> 33:16.330
I think my muffins are done.

33:16.405 --> 33:19.124
Hold on a second. Just wait.

33:21.410 --> 33:24.222
I came here to talk about what's
going on with this family,

33:24.246 --> 33:27.841
and what I'm getting is a
very bad piece of theater.

33:29.251 --> 33:31.062
After the fiasco of
the other night,

33:31.086 --> 33:33.263
I spent some time
with your files

33:33.297 --> 33:35.140
because I was worried about you,

33:35.299 --> 33:38.644
worried particularly
about Owen and Claudia.

33:39.303 --> 33:42.731
What I found was a
little unsettling.

33:43.182 --> 33:44.775
I don't know what that could be.

33:44.808 --> 33:45.827
Really?

33:45.851 --> 33:50.530
Well, first of all, you've had four
nannies in the past nine months.

33:51.065 --> 33:53.367
That's not a lot of
stability for a baby.

33:53.651 --> 33:56.212
What's more, your latest nanny
doesn't seem to be here,

33:56.236 --> 33:58.956
but your second one is here.

33:59.073 --> 34:00.008
I can explain.

34:00.032 --> 34:01.291
We can explain.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.169
Julia...

34:04.328 --> 34:05.430
your file says

34:05.454 --> 34:06.973
that you have a job,

34:06.997 --> 34:09.141
that you work at
Backstreet Burger

34:09.166 --> 34:10.592
two nights a week,

34:11.251 --> 34:12.594
but I checked,

34:12.920 --> 34:14.513
and you don't.

34:14.797 --> 34:16.264
You never have.

34:17.841 --> 34:19.393
Claudia...

34:19.885 --> 34:21.321
a police report was filed

34:21.344 --> 34:22.947
less than 48 hours ago

34:22.972 --> 34:25.023
that listed you as
a missing person.

34:26.058 --> 34:28.360
I was at a friend's house.

34:28.393 --> 34:29.704
We kind of overreacted.

34:29.728 --> 34:32.822
No, you didn't. You
thought she was missing.

34:33.148 --> 34:34.626
Look, Mrs. Gideon,

34:34.650 --> 34:36.503
I can explain all of this stuff.

34:36.527 --> 34:38.004
I can explain what's
going on with Claudia

34:38.027 --> 34:39.380
and the nanny situation.

34:39.405 --> 34:40.674
I promise you that everything

34:40.697 --> 34:42.175
is under control around here.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.458
I'm on top of things.

34:43.492 --> 34:44.793
Are you really?

34:44.994 --> 34:46.295
Yes, I am.

34:47.036 --> 34:49.130
I'm not so sure
about that, Bailey.

34:49.915 --> 34:53.010
Your records show that you're
nearly failing out of school.

34:54.168 --> 34:56.679
Two courses. Math and Chemistry.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.349
You're close to
academic probation.

35:01.385 --> 35:02.570
That doesn't sound to me

35:02.594 --> 35:04.813
like someone who's
on top of things.

35:06.390 --> 35:08.576
I think we need to
take a serious look

35:08.600 --> 35:11.361
at how well this family works.

35:17.568 --> 35:19.161
Where do you work, huh?

35:19.236 --> 35:21.330
Where does your money come from?
What is it, that club?

35:23.323 --> 35:24.541
Right...

35:25.159 --> 35:26.460
And you?

35:26.493 --> 35:27.929
You think you were gonna
fail out of school

35:27.953 --> 35:29.546
and no one was gonna notice?

35:30.539 --> 35:32.017
You think they weren't
gonna come back to me

35:32.041 --> 35:33.925
and say, "What the hell's
going on in this family?"

35:35.085 --> 35:36.604
Things do not work around here!

35:36.628 --> 35:38.138
They don't work!

35:39.048 --> 35:40.400
No one tells the truth.

35:40.424 --> 35:42.027
No one trusts anybody else.

35:42.051 --> 35:43.352
Like you're one to talk.

35:43.510 --> 35:44.738
I know I'm guilty too.

35:44.762 --> 35:45.864
You're damn right, you are.

35:45.888 --> 35:47.564
Would you all just stop?

35:52.061 --> 35:53.320
What does this mean?

35:56.231 --> 35:58.575
Does this mean we shouldn't
stay together like this?

35:58.984 --> 36:00.128
- No.
- No.

36:00.152 --> 36:01.536
Of course not.

36:03.739 --> 36:05.165
What can they do to us?

36:06.283 --> 36:07.918
Watch us all the time.

36:08.118 --> 36:09.669
Watch everything we do.

36:10.871 --> 36:12.881
They can just show up
any time they want?

36:13.415 --> 36:14.601
They can just knock on the door

36:14.625 --> 36:16.385
and say, "That's it, it's over"?

36:17.044 --> 36:18.303
No.

36:20.172 --> 36:21.640
I don't know, Claud.

36:25.177 --> 36:26.812
I don't know.

36:30.766 --> 36:32.067
Oh.

36:32.893 --> 36:34.528
Now you show up.

36:35.395 --> 36:37.114
Your shift started
at eight o'clock.

36:37.397 --> 36:38.615
Where were you?

36:39.733 --> 36:42.661
Morgan, I can't come
back to work here.

36:43.362 --> 36:44.955
Come on.

36:45.447 --> 36:46.549
Why not?

36:46.573 --> 36:47.958
Because...

36:48.617 --> 36:50.544
Well, it's complicated.

36:50.744 --> 36:51.971
No, it's not.

36:51.995 --> 36:53.380
What, you, uh...

36:53.705 --> 36:54.724
You won't forgive me?

36:54.748 --> 36:56.633
No, that's not it.

36:57.334 --> 36:59.219
I can't explain, really.

36:59.795 --> 37:01.481
Working here, it
just wouldn't be

37:01.505 --> 37:03.557
the right thing for
me to do right now.

37:03.757 --> 37:05.267
It'd cause problems.

37:06.844 --> 37:10.355
One slightly offensive
judgment call...

37:12.307 --> 37:13.692
and you're gonna write me off?

37:14.184 --> 37:15.485
No.

37:15.811 --> 37:17.737
All I'm saying is, uh...

37:18.981 --> 37:20.991
That I can't be your employee.

37:21.441 --> 37:22.659
Oh.

37:23.443 --> 37:24.786
That's all?

37:26.572 --> 37:28.123
I think I can live with that.

37:29.241 --> 37:30.500
Good.

37:33.287 --> 37:34.713
So I didn't blow it?

37:36.081 --> 37:37.507
Not entirely.

37:39.626 --> 37:40.927
Not yet.

37:44.464 --> 37:45.849
There you are.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.559
I was looking for you.

37:47.676 --> 37:50.061
Look, I don't need you to
give me a hard time, okay?

37:50.387 --> 37:51.771
Not after tonight.

37:54.183 --> 37:55.775
Just tell me, Bay.

37:57.352 --> 37:58.820
How bad is this school stuff?

38:00.939 --> 38:02.365
I don't know.

38:02.691 --> 38:04.284
Pretty bad, I guess.

38:06.695 --> 38:09.090
Mr. Coveny keeps letting
me do extra credit work,

38:09.114 --> 38:11.124
but I'm still
hovering around a D.

38:11.992 --> 38:14.053
I have Miss Traugott
for Science.

38:14.077 --> 38:15.555
Miss Traugott.

38:15.579 --> 38:16.723
Yeah.

38:16.747 --> 38:18.715
She never cuts anyone any slack.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.551
I'm trying.

38:21.835 --> 38:23.438
You know, it's not like
I'm just blowing it off.

38:23.462 --> 38:24.596
I'm trying.

38:26.882 --> 38:28.892
Why didn't you say
anything before?

38:29.801 --> 38:31.853
I mean, why did you
keep this a secret?

38:33.805 --> 38:36.399
That's kind of a funny question
coming from you, don't you think?

38:42.773 --> 38:45.408
Where did we get this idea that
we've got to fail in private?

38:45.609 --> 38:48.286
I mean, where did
that come from?

38:48.570 --> 38:49.996
I don't know, man.

38:52.366 --> 38:53.625
You know,

38:55.327 --> 38:58.088
we could probably spring for a
tutor a couple hours a week.

38:59.164 --> 39:02.050
I mean, cut back on the takeout,

39:02.209 --> 39:03.593
eat in more.

39:03.961 --> 39:05.679
That's got to save
some money, right?

39:09.341 --> 39:11.226
You've got to keep up in school.

39:13.011 --> 39:15.949
I know you've got a lot of
responsibilities around here.

39:15.973 --> 39:19.484
I mean, I know there's a
lot you take care of,

39:20.310 --> 39:21.528
but...

39:22.229 --> 39:23.738
it's just not an excuse.

39:28.819 --> 39:29.953
What?

39:30.445 --> 39:31.913
Same goes for you, Charlie.

39:35.409 --> 39:36.751
Same goes for you.

39:45.335 --> 39:47.429
What are you doing
here, Claudia?

39:48.880 --> 39:50.108
It's eight o'clock
in the morning.

39:50.132 --> 39:51.683
Where are your
brothers and sisters?

39:53.760 --> 39:55.895
Are you thinking of
splitting us up?

39:56.054 --> 39:57.355
What?

39:58.015 --> 39:59.242
No.

39:59.266 --> 40:02.078
Listen, all I'm thinking about

40:02.102 --> 40:04.988
is making sure you kids
are taken care of.

40:06.064 --> 40:07.532
Maybe by splitting us up?

40:07.983 --> 40:10.744
I am not the enemy, Claudia.

40:11.820 --> 40:13.413
Yes, you are.

40:14.781 --> 40:18.335
You may not want to
be, but you are.

40:18.827 --> 40:20.045
No, sweetie.

40:20.078 --> 40:21.379
To me you are.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.259
I mean, I don't get it.

40:26.835 --> 40:29.471
You make it sound like you're
doing this all for me.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.222
I am.

40:31.715 --> 40:33.808
Then why don't you just
ask me what I want?

40:34.760 --> 40:36.478
Please, just ask me.

40:37.137 --> 40:39.449
Claudia, I have to make sure

40:39.473 --> 40:41.993
that you and your brother
are taken care of.

40:42.017 --> 40:43.735
We are taken care of.

40:46.396 --> 40:47.457
Two days ago,

40:47.481 --> 40:49.584
your brothers and sister
had to go to the police

40:49.608 --> 40:52.086
because they had no idea
where you were, Claudia.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.546
That worries me.

40:53.570 --> 40:56.049
That's because you only look
at the stuff we do wrong.

40:56.073 --> 40:57.425
I don't think so, sweetheart.

40:57.449 --> 40:59.042
What about all the
stuff we do right?

40:59.743 --> 41:00.762
Come on. Like...

41:00.786 --> 41:03.014
Like the fact that Bailey gets
up in the middle of the night

41:03.038 --> 41:04.631
every night for Owen.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.685
I mean, he's 16, and on
Friday nights, he babysits.

41:07.709 --> 41:09.395
- Claudia...
- Julia trims my bangs

41:09.419 --> 41:11.689
and she doesn't let me
watch movies on cable,

41:11.713 --> 41:12.732
and Charlie has this rule

41:12.756 --> 41:14.724
about eating
vegetables for dinner,

41:14.841 --> 41:17.028
and Bailey went with my
class to the planetarium

41:17.052 --> 41:18.687
with, like, three other mothers,

41:18.845 --> 41:21.532
and they make me get my teeth get
cleaned twice a year, and...

41:21.556 --> 41:23.368
and we all take turns
reading to Owen,

41:23.392 --> 41:25.578
and I'm trying to think
of everything else...

41:25.602 --> 41:26.579
Claudia, you...

41:26.603 --> 41:28.238
What else do you want from us?

41:28.563 --> 41:29.823
Tell me.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.001
What more are we supposed to do?

41:32.025 --> 41:33.368
Are we supposed to be perfect?

41:33.860 --> 41:35.245
Of course not.

41:36.988 --> 41:39.582
Are there that many families
who do that much better?

41:46.957 --> 41:49.175
We made it through the
last nine months.

41:51.795 --> 41:54.139
I don't think it can get
much harder than that.

41:55.841 --> 41:56.975
Do you?

42:00.178 --> 42:02.355
The only thing that's going
to ruin this for us,

42:04.766 --> 42:07.152
and that's going to stop
us from being a family,

42:09.396 --> 42:10.905
is you.

42:12.649 --> 42:14.325
Okay, Claud. Breakfast.

42:14.443 --> 42:16.671
What do you think would impress Mrs.
Gideon more...

42:16.695 --> 42:17.588
Come and get it!

42:17.612 --> 42:19.048
Scooping ice cream
at the Udder Delight

42:19.072 --> 42:20.591
or working at Polk
Street Library?

42:20.615 --> 42:22.125
Do you get to bring
home free ice cream?

42:22.659 --> 42:24.043
Probably not.

42:24.202 --> 42:25.430
Library.

42:25.454 --> 42:27.046
Library.

42:27.247 --> 42:30.258
I could probably give you a lift in a couple
of days a week on my way into Berkeley.

42:32.210 --> 42:33.386
Thanks.

42:37.632 --> 42:38.975
Claudia!

42:40.051 --> 42:41.436
Where the hell is she?

42:43.555 --> 42:44.773
Claudia!

42:48.643 --> 42:49.996
- I don't believe this.
- Not again.

42:50.020 --> 42:51.821
I'm gonna kill her.

42:53.190 --> 42:55.001
God, Claud, what happened
to you leaving a note, huh?

42:55.025 --> 42:56.002
After what we've been through,

42:56.026 --> 42:57.336
can't you show us a
little consideration?

42:57.360 --> 42:58.912
You want to tell
us where you were?

42:59.029 --> 43:00.663
I went to see Mrs. Gideon...

43:01.239 --> 43:02.749
to talk to her about us.

43:03.575 --> 43:04.876
What did you say?

43:05.118 --> 43:06.095
Wait a second.

43:06.119 --> 43:07.879
- Claudia...
- What did she say?

43:08.246 --> 43:09.265
She said

43:09.289 --> 43:12.258
she expects to see you pulling
in at least a C average,

43:12.709 --> 43:16.022
and she wants a letter from
any future employer of yours,

43:16.046 --> 43:17.931
verifying your employment,

43:18.089 --> 43:19.525
and she strongly recommends

43:19.549 --> 43:21.643
we get a message board
to keep by the phone.

43:23.553 --> 43:24.896
And?

43:25.180 --> 43:27.774
And she'll see us in six months.

43:27.807 --> 43:29.526
- You're kidding.
- What?

43:29.976 --> 43:31.496
Claud, what'd you say to her?

43:31.520 --> 43:33.196
How'd you convince her
to change her mind?

43:37.984 --> 43:38.961
Claudia.

43:38.985 --> 43:40.203
Look.

43:42.489 --> 43:43.706
Oh, my God.

43:44.157 --> 43:45.176
He's standing!

43:45.200 --> 43:46.177
He's walking!

43:46.201 --> 43:48.044
Oh, look at him!

43:52.916 --> 43:54.769
He's definitely walking!

43:54.793 --> 43:56.479
Strutted right across the room.

43:56.503 --> 43:57.688
Yay, Owen!

43:57.712 --> 43:58.731
You see him walk?

43:58.755 --> 44:00.932
Do it again, Owen. Come on.

44:02.509 --> 44:03.736
Come on. Try it again.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.144
Come on, Owen.
