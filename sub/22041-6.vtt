WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:01.796
- [Gordon] Tonight on "Hotel Hell",

00:01.796 --> 00:02.665
(playful music)

00:02.665 --> 00:04.075
I'll be investigating a murder mystery

00:04.075 --> 00:06.545
in the Idaho Town Coeur d'Alene.

00:06.545 --> 00:07.413
(woman screams)

00:07.413 --> 00:08.613
But the victim isn't a person...

00:08.613 --> 00:10.260
(dramatic music)

00:10.260 --> 00:11.643
It's the Roosevelt Inn.

00:12.815 --> 00:13.900
(decoration crackling)

00:13.900 --> 00:15.036
(Gordon coughing)

00:15.036 --> 00:17.256
There are plenty of clues
as I dust for fingerprints.

00:17.256 --> 00:19.133
It's like someone's ashes in an urn.

00:20.457 --> 00:22.918
And uncover...
(suspenseful music)

00:22.918 --> 00:24.524
horrific stains.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.099
Oh God!

00:26.099 --> 00:27.143
- Brilliant.

00:27.143 --> 00:29.039
- [Gordon] The prime suspect is the owner,

00:29.039 --> 00:30.509
a Sherlock Holmes wannabe,

00:30.509 --> 00:32.253
who disguises himself as a chef.

00:33.147 --> 00:35.431
- We must cook the fabulous food.

00:35.431 --> 00:37.214
- [Gordon] But can't even boil an egg.

00:37.214 --> 00:38.571
Oh, it's raw.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.716
(Gordon's head bashing)

00:40.716 --> 00:42.323
You're a fucking joke.

00:42.323 --> 00:43.192
- I'm gonna kill him.

00:43.192 --> 00:44.440
Just talk to my hand.
(Gordon's hand banging)

00:44.440 --> 00:45.764
- [Gordon] I've got to solve the case

00:45.764 --> 00:47.067
before there's another victim,

00:47.067 --> 00:48.162
the owners' marriage.

00:48.162 --> 00:52.065
- I just feel like I'm gonna suffocate.

00:57.192 --> 00:59.885
(upbeat music)

01:03.042 --> 01:05.660
(spider's legs tapping)

01:05.660 --> 01:08.353
(fire roaring)

01:15.138 --> 01:17.919
(tiger roaring)

01:20.905 --> 01:22.624
(electrics hissing)

01:22.624 --> 01:23.492
(upbeat music)

01:23.492 --> 01:24.668
- [Gordon] Surrounded by stunning lakes,

01:24.668 --> 01:26.732
and close to two major ski resorts,

01:26.732 --> 01:28.765
Coeur d'Alene is one of Idaho's premier

01:28.765 --> 01:30.632
vacation destinations.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.614
It's also home to The Roosevelt Inn.

01:33.614 --> 01:35.940
The Inn is a 16-bedroom
converted schoolhouse

01:35.940 --> 01:40.173
owned and run by one of its
former students, John Hough.

01:40.173 --> 01:43.228
- The Roosevelt Inn is the first hotel

01:43.228 --> 01:44.750
I've ever actually owned.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.502
I was up here signing the papers,

01:46.502 --> 01:47.899
and I called my wife, Tina.

01:47.899 --> 01:52.414
And I say, "We now own the Roosevelt Inn".

01:52.414 --> 01:54.114
And all of a sudden I hear this...

01:54.114 --> 01:56.627
(John mock sobs)

01:56.627 --> 01:58.295
She started crying.

01:58.295 --> 02:00.339
- I did not want to buy the hotel,

02:00.339 --> 02:01.934
but John really did.

02:01.934 --> 02:04.061
I have told John many times that

02:04.061 --> 02:05.750
he won't be cold in the ground

02:05.750 --> 02:07.877
and I'm on my way home to Kentucky.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.371
No, I'm not going to cry anymore.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.089
I'm so tried of crying, stop, stop, stop.

02:11.089 --> 02:11.957
(Tina's hand slaps)

02:11.957 --> 02:13.737
- [Gordon] The Roosevelt Inn
is not just hell for Tina,

02:13.737 --> 02:15.354
it's hell for the guests
who have to put up

02:15.354 --> 02:18.284
with the consequences of
John's eccentric behaviour.

02:18.284 --> 02:20.160
- [Guest] Sorry, we're
not trying to be a pain.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.287
- Yes, you are

02:21.287 --> 02:23.236
- I would say that the hotel's struggling

02:23.236 --> 02:25.929
because it's dated, it's old.

02:25.929 --> 02:26.930
- [Female Guest] It kinda
smells funny in here.

02:26.930 --> 02:27.960
It smells old.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.962
- [Male Guest] Probably because it is old.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.620
- [Gordon] And the food
coming out of the Inn's

02:31.620 --> 02:33.361
shoebox size kitchen,

02:33.361 --> 02:34.657
is as bad as the decor.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.824
- Oh, that's disgusting.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.693
- Ohh!

02:38.693 --> 02:40.472
- [Gordon] Oblivious to the problems,

02:40.472 --> 02:42.360
John's performance never stops.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.925
- I'll ask you questions,
you'll give me questions.

02:44.925 --> 02:46.979
I'll ask questions, you'll give answers.

02:46.979 --> 02:49.648
I'll ask you questions,
you'll give me answers.

02:49.648 --> 02:52.057
- [Gordon] As John is more
focused on playing dress up.

02:52.057 --> 02:53.131
- How was that, Watson?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.747
- [Gordon] Than on being an Innkeeper.

02:54.747 --> 02:57.166
- John refuses to grow old gracefully.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.960
It's Halloween for John every day.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.992
He loves to dress up.

02:59.992 --> 03:01.952
- [Man] It's the curse,
it's the bloody curse.

03:01.952 --> 03:03.204
- Once a month at the Roosevelt,

03:03.204 --> 03:06.248
we put on a murder mystery and dinner.

03:06.248 --> 03:07.291
How's everything going in here for you?

03:07.291 --> 03:08.626
- Fine.

03:08.626 --> 03:10.701
I basically do everything.

03:10.701 --> 03:11.848
You wanna finish making up this bed,

03:11.848 --> 03:12.716
and I'll do the bathroom.

03:12.716 --> 03:13.599
- Okay, great.

03:13.599 --> 03:15.466
- I feel my dad doesn't appreciate my mom.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.906
My mom works three times
harder than my dad does.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.657
There are times that I'll come in,

03:19.657 --> 03:22.066
and she's out busy doing something,

03:22.066 --> 03:23.995
and he's sitting on the
couch reading a book.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.549
- [Gordon] As the business has suffered,

03:25.549 --> 03:27.895
so has John and Tina's relationship.

03:27.895 --> 03:30.001
- We actually had to go
through marriage counselling,

03:30.001 --> 03:32.785
I don't think John understands
the sacrifice I've made.

03:32.785 --> 03:33.776
- [Gordon] Unless I can get this place

03:33.776 --> 03:35.121
on the road to recovery,

03:35.121 --> 03:37.811
John and Tina will lose everything.

03:37.811 --> 03:40.679
- If I lose the Roosevelt,
I don't just lose my job,

03:40.679 --> 03:43.963
I lose my home, I become unemployed,

03:43.963 --> 03:46.475
and homeless in one fell swoop.

03:46.475 --> 03:50.306
- I don't think we're
gonna pull out of this one.

03:52.544 --> 03:53.702
(whooshing)

03:53.702 --> 03:55.767
- I'm here in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.800
I seriously hope this place is better

03:57.800 --> 03:59.541
than the other shit holes I've stayed in.

03:59.541 --> 04:00.729
Oh my God!

04:00.729 --> 04:03.177
(playful music)

04:03.177 --> 04:04.046
Look at that!

04:04.046 --> 04:06.527
They say all publicity is good publicity.

04:06.527 --> 04:08.289
With a billboard that old-fashioned,

04:08.289 --> 04:09.332
(glass crashing)

04:09.332 --> 04:10.709
I'm not so sure.

04:10.709 --> 04:11.741
You're fucking joking, aren't you?

04:11.741 --> 04:12.609
Come on!

04:14.556 --> 04:17.089
The Roosevelt Inn Bed and Breakfast.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.009
It's like something out
of the Adams Family.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.234
Roosevelt School, place
looks grim from the outside.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.423
Hello!

04:24.423 --> 04:26.057
- Welcome to the Roosevelt.
- Good to see you.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.892
- I recognise that voice,
you're Gordon Ramsay.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.810
- Well, good to see you.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.801
My God, look at those chairs there.

04:29.801 --> 04:30.739
Are they from the school?

04:30.739 --> 04:33.732
- They are, those came out
of the first grade classroom.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.077
Look, you almost fit.

04:35.077 --> 04:36.534
- A reception for dwarfs, or just...

04:36.534 --> 04:38.069
(John laughs)

04:38.069 --> 04:39.185
First impression from the outside,

04:39.185 --> 04:41.667
it's almost like walking
into a funeral parlour.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.104
- Oh!

04:43.104 --> 04:45.274
(bouncy music)

04:45.274 --> 04:46.838
- It smells like shit
as well, what is that?

04:46.838 --> 04:48.062
Is that the dog?

04:49.789 --> 04:51.061
- [John] Oh boy, I sure hope not.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.532
Oh, Rohan, Jesus Christ!

04:54.252 --> 04:55.827
- [Gordon] Jesus!

04:55.827 --> 04:56.932
- This is our dining room.

04:56.932 --> 04:58.058
- Who's the chef here?

04:58.058 --> 05:00.978
I saw a billboard of a guy
with the most hideous hat on,

05:00.978 --> 05:01.846
(John laughs)

05:01.846 --> 05:04.065
covered in trees, and this six-foot hat.

05:04.065 --> 05:05.108
- That's me.

05:06.063 --> 05:09.090
It's kind of grown into Jean Pierre,

05:09.090 --> 05:10.964
the mad French chef of the Roosevelt,

05:10.964 --> 05:11.832
because you're in Coeur d'Alene,

05:11.832 --> 05:13.146
it's a French-named town, you know,

05:13.146 --> 05:16.840
so we must cook the fabulous
food, wear this outfit.

05:18.169 --> 05:20.070
(John laughs)

05:20.070 --> 05:22.311
Now you'll see school photos.

05:22.311 --> 05:23.180
- Yes.

05:23.180 --> 05:24.142
- Down the hallway here,

05:24.142 --> 05:25.898
and these are of kids
that went to school here

05:25.898 --> 05:26.767
at the Roosevelt.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.140
And the ones with the arrows pointing

05:28.140 --> 05:29.892
at the really cute adorable little boy,

05:29.892 --> 05:32.551
that's me of course, because
I went to school here.

05:32.551 --> 05:33.419
- [Gordon] Oh, you went to school here?

05:33.419 --> 05:34.292
- My elementary school.

05:35.741 --> 05:37.598
- [Gordon] Who wants to
live in their old school.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.725
It's like getting a
detention that never ends.

05:39.725 --> 05:42.300
- [John] The guests get to hang
out down here with the dogs,

05:42.300 --> 05:43.489
and watch TV.

05:43.489 --> 05:44.629
- You are kidding me.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.587
You can't smell those dogs?

05:47.587 --> 05:48.827
- Oh, yes, I can.

05:48.827 --> 05:51.716
The dogs, actually
believe it or not, Gordon,

05:51.716 --> 05:54.029
are one of the highlights here.

05:54.029 --> 05:55.522
(playful music)

05:55.522 --> 05:57.430
- Now you're sounding deluded.

05:58.546 --> 05:59.630
What's next?

05:59.630 --> 06:02.560
- Our little ballroom or
our multi-purpose room.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.429
- [Gordon] Oh come on!

06:03.429 --> 06:05.511
- Rohan, you're not
supposed to be in this room.

06:05.511 --> 06:06.379
- [Gordon] Don't you think this place

06:06.379 --> 06:08.410
could at least have some sort of makeover?

06:08.410 --> 06:09.869
- Well, sadly, Gordon,

06:09.869 --> 06:12.000
we renovated this room four years ago.

06:13.112 --> 06:15.291
This is new.
- Stop!

06:15.291 --> 06:16.160
- No.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.439
- [Gordon] This room looks
like it was last decorated

06:17.439 --> 06:19.921
in 1908, not 2008.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.815
How much did you spend on this?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.149
- $54,000.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.623
- $54,000?

06:23.623 --> 06:25.106
- Five four, yeah.

06:26.688 --> 06:28.909
- Not 54 hundred, 54 thousand?

06:28.909 --> 06:30.505
- I know, lovely, eh?

06:30.505 --> 06:31.558
- Christ almighty.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.632
And does it generate money?

06:32.632 --> 06:33.612
- No.

06:33.612 --> 06:34.665
- [Gordon] I can't believe anyone

06:34.665 --> 06:37.491
would want to rent that
space, it's hideous.

06:37.491 --> 06:39.366
I'm dying to have a look upstairs.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.234
It can't get any worse.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.255
- [John] It could get worse.

06:41.255 --> 06:43.747
- [Gordon] And what's your
occupancy across the year?

06:43.747 --> 06:45.269
- Probably around mid-20s.

06:45.269 --> 06:48.283
- 20% across the board, ouch.
(John laughs)

06:48.283 --> 06:49.941
I'm amazed you find it so funny.

06:49.941 --> 06:50.983
- This is your room.

06:51.943 --> 06:53.204
- [Gordon] Okay, what's with all the pink?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.060
It's like someone threw
up strawberry milkshake

06:55.060 --> 06:56.312
all over the place.

06:56.312 --> 06:58.314
My room has two levels,

06:58.314 --> 06:59.857
each as bad as the other.

06:59.857 --> 07:04.257
Oh, everything looks like
we're in a time warp.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.946
It's so dated.

07:05.946 --> 07:07.959
So my room, how much do
you pay to stay in here?

07:07.959 --> 07:09.603
- Ah, 319.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.566
- $319?

07:11.566 --> 07:13.872
Bloody hell, I'm speechless.

07:13.872 --> 07:15.737
(John laughs)

07:15.737 --> 07:17.794
13-year-old decor, $319 a night.

07:17.794 --> 07:18.662
(John laughs)

07:18.662 --> 07:19.543
Can I ask you something?

07:19.543 --> 07:20.412
- [John] Fire away.

07:20.412 --> 07:22.640
- Why do you think
everything's a big joke?

07:24.204 --> 07:27.009
- Because you're very critical.

07:27.009 --> 07:29.293
- I'm here to get this place right,

07:29.293 --> 07:32.306
but what I don't understand
is how blase you are

07:32.306 --> 07:34.204
to the situation.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.705
I'm gonna give you the truth,

07:35.705 --> 07:37.968
and if you don't like
that, then I'm out of here.

07:37.968 --> 07:38.844
- [John] What do you want me to do,

07:38.844 --> 07:40.551
get angry and punch you?

07:40.551 --> 07:42.516
- No, you wanna punch me?

07:42.516 --> 07:43.579
You go first.

07:43.579 --> 07:45.903
- Well, maybe I do wanna
punch you a little bit.

07:45.903 --> 07:49.125
I can become physically
very, very violent,

07:49.125 --> 07:51.735
and have in the past, people get hurt.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.810
Here's your keys.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.081
(dramatic music)

07:57.081 --> 07:59.159
- [Gordon] John, John!

08:00.189 --> 08:02.044
You can't just walk away.

08:02.044 --> 08:02.965
Where you going?

08:06.415 --> 08:07.697
(crashing)

08:07.697 --> 08:08.698
(rain tapping)

08:08.698 --> 08:09.566
(upbeat music)

08:09.566 --> 08:11.762
Since I checked into
Idaho's Roosevelt Inn,

08:11.762 --> 08:14.025
I've been unimpressed
by the horrible decor.

08:14.025 --> 08:14.893
What's with the all the pink,

08:14.893 --> 08:16.892
it's like someone's vomited everywhere.

08:16.892 --> 08:19.822
And the dated event space
that smells like wet dog.

08:19.822 --> 08:22.259
- The dogs actually are
one of the highlights here.

08:22.259 --> 08:25.140
- [Gordon] But the biggest
problem here is the owner John,

08:25.140 --> 08:28.289
who seems to think it's funny
that his Inn is a disgrace.

08:28.289 --> 08:29.582
The only time he stopped laughing

08:29.582 --> 08:30.541
was when I confronted him

08:30.541 --> 08:32.356
with how bad things really are here.

08:32.356 --> 08:35.244
What I don't understand
is how blase you are

08:35.244 --> 08:36.529
to the situation.

08:36.529 --> 08:37.655
- Here's your keys.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.503
- John, you can't just walk away.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.941
While John hides on the truth downstairs,

08:44.941 --> 08:47.186
I'm gonna have a closer look in my room.

08:48.279 --> 08:50.082
It's like someone's ashes in an urn.

08:50.082 --> 08:51.168
(bedpost squeaking)

08:51.168 --> 08:52.054
An absolute mess.

08:55.003 --> 08:56.442
That's what the rug's on the floor for,

08:56.442 --> 08:57.311
just gross.

08:58.423 --> 08:59.841
Look at the dust on there.

08:59.841 --> 09:01.291
Most disgusting of all...

09:01.291 --> 09:02.282
Shit!

09:02.282 --> 09:04.128
...is the dust magnet
hanging over my pillows.

09:04.128 --> 09:06.912
(decoration rattling)

09:06.912 --> 09:09.866
(Gordon coughing)

09:11.438 --> 09:13.304
(hands brushing)

09:13.304 --> 09:14.433
Jesus Christ!

09:15.473 --> 09:17.164
How long's that thing been up there?

09:17.164 --> 09:19.132
Help!
(fist thudding)

09:19.132 --> 09:20.000
Let me out.

09:22.864 --> 09:24.773
I hope I'll get a sense of
what's really going on here

09:24.773 --> 09:26.566
from John's wife, Tina.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.078
- [John] Gordon, this is my lovely wife.

09:28.078 --> 09:28.996
- [Gordon] How are you?

09:28.996 --> 09:30.695
- I'm stressed out.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.311
- What hotel were you running before this?

09:32.311 --> 09:33.490
- I was running a dental office,

09:33.490 --> 09:34.637
I worked in a dental office,

09:34.637 --> 09:36.785
I wasn't running anything except my home.

09:36.785 --> 09:40.017
- So why would you go
from teeth to a hotel?

09:40.017 --> 09:41.789
- Because he bought a hotel.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.657
(John laughs)

09:42.657 --> 09:44.647
- So you bought the hotel?

09:44.647 --> 09:47.504
- It was my negotiation.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.714
- You negotiated, you both bought it?

09:49.714 --> 09:50.642
- Yes.

09:50.642 --> 09:52.415
- Willingly or unwillingly?

09:52.415 --> 09:53.283
- Unwillingly.

09:53.283 --> 09:54.187
(dramatic blast)

09:54.187 --> 09:57.055
I was very happy and content
with the life that we had.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.401
So when John told me that we
were buying the Roosevelt,

09:59.401 --> 10:00.319
I burst into tears.

10:00.319 --> 10:02.384
- [Gordon] How much did you buy it for?

10:02.384 --> 10:03.365
- 700,000.

10:03.365 --> 10:04.635
- 700,000, how much have you spent on it?

10:04.635 --> 10:06.994
- We owe 1,100,000.

10:06.994 --> 10:08.598
- Oh, so you haven't
paid back the debt yet?

10:08.598 --> 10:09.533
- To the bank, no.

10:09.533 --> 10:10.665
No, the bank owns this.
- [Gordon] God!

10:10.665 --> 10:12.612
- We sold our house we had here.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.094
- Cashed in our 401K, everything we had.

10:15.094 --> 10:16.314
- Oh my word!

10:16.314 --> 10:18.339
Where's your house now that you live in?

10:18.339 --> 10:19.207
- Up in the attic.

10:19.207 --> 10:20.255
- [John] We live up top of the building.

10:20.255 --> 10:21.819
- This is my hell.

10:21.819 --> 10:24.732
I have had terrible experiences here.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.618
Business experience, financial hardship,

10:28.618 --> 10:30.897
everything's just falling
apart here for me.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.331
(John laughs)

10:33.331 --> 10:35.500
- You seem serious, you seem joking.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.845
It's almost like you're playing at it.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.714
- It is kind of an entertainment though.

10:38.714 --> 10:39.858
(Tina grunts)

10:39.858 --> 10:41.057
To a certain degree.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.382
- At $1.1 million, that's
an expensive entertainment.

10:43.382 --> 10:44.540
- Well, yeah.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.239
- I didn't realise it was this bad.

10:46.239 --> 10:47.553
How's the relationship?

10:47.553 --> 10:48.857
- We're in a rough place.

10:50.535 --> 10:51.821
- We went through marriage counselling,

10:51.821 --> 10:54.564
when was that, four or five years ago?

10:54.564 --> 10:55.520
- Because of this business?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.614
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.283
- [Gordon] And still working
together seven days a week?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.469
- Yes, 24/7, sleeping in the same bed.

11:00.469 --> 11:01.338
- [Gordon] You're a brave lady.

11:01.338 --> 11:02.944
- I'm ready for something to change.

11:02.944 --> 11:05.387
I'm ready for anything at this point.

11:05.387 --> 11:10.232
I just feel like I'm gonna suffocate.

11:10.232 --> 11:12.370
- I'm gonna get my bag unpacked,

11:12.370 --> 11:15.467
and I'll catch up with
you later, thank you.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.062
Tina looks ready to bail out,

11:17.062 --> 11:18.762
and all John can do is laugh.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.624
He thinks being over $1 million in debt

11:20.624 --> 11:22.349
is entertainment.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.685
I think this marriage is in
as much trouble as the Inn.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.160
Clearly in denial, but more importantly,

11:29.595 --> 11:32.098
a man that won't man up
and take responsibility.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.288
(enlightening music)

11:36.288 --> 11:37.384
I've been told that tonight,

11:37.384 --> 11:40.252
the Roosevelt Inn is holding
a murder mystery dinner.

11:40.252 --> 11:41.993
It's an event they host once a month.

11:41.993 --> 11:45.080
I have a feeling it's
gonna be hard to forget.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.508
- And if you'll head on into there,

11:46.508 --> 11:47.655
I'll get you all checked in ready to go,

11:47.655 --> 11:49.052
you look fabulous.

11:49.052 --> 11:51.002
We usually always have
a lot of fun with this.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.359
We're going to continue
to have fun with this.

11:53.359 --> 11:54.839
- You're dressed in that for this evening?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.519
- I play the part of
Sherlock Holmes, old man.

11:57.519 --> 11:58.770
- You're playing an Englishman.

11:58.770 --> 12:00.251
- I am playing an Englishman,

12:00.251 --> 12:02.482
and I even have the pipe to go with it.

12:02.482 --> 12:04.422
I've studied this accent long and hard,

12:04.422 --> 12:08.030
in fact mine is better
than your British accent.

12:08.030 --> 12:10.188
I actually don't know where
Gordon got his accent,

12:10.188 --> 12:11.940
he obviously doesn't
practise it very much.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.123
Mine is far more authentic
than his is, absolutely.

12:16.184 --> 12:17.522
- Wow!

12:17.522 --> 12:18.391
(mellow music)

12:18.391 --> 12:20.886
While John prances around
as Sherlock Holmes,

12:20.886 --> 12:23.570
I wonder what Tina does
during these events.

12:23.570 --> 12:24.439
- [Tina] Hello.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.474
- Oh my God!

12:25.474 --> 12:26.976
What have you got on?

12:27.878 --> 12:29.318
This is crazy.

12:29.318 --> 12:30.490
What happened to you?

12:30.490 --> 12:31.814
- It's murder mystery night, sir.

12:31.814 --> 12:33.093
- It's gone from an Inn to

12:33.093 --> 12:34.191
"Little House on the Prairie".
(Tina laughs)

12:34.191 --> 12:36.464
I mean, honestly.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.226
- It'll be my job this evening

12:38.226 --> 12:39.665
to cook your dinner.

12:39.665 --> 12:41.793
- [Gordon] So while John
gets to play Sherlock Holmes,

12:41.793 --> 12:43.471
his wife is stuck in the kitchen.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.974
Wake up, John, this is
not the 1800s anymore.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.277
- John definitely likes dressing up

12:47.277 --> 12:48.341
more for the murder mysteries,

12:48.341 --> 12:49.988
because he's not in the hot kitchen,

12:49.988 --> 12:52.063
he's out there hamming
it up with the guests,

12:52.063 --> 12:53.450
playing Sherlock Holmes.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.319
- Okay.

12:55.655 --> 12:58.559
Right, um, I'm not too sure
what to make of all this,

12:58.559 --> 13:00.353
it's a little bit bizarre.

13:00.353 --> 13:01.750
Slightly weird.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.263
I wonder if this event
even makes any money.

13:04.263 --> 13:05.754
Is this profitable?

13:05.754 --> 13:08.341
- It is profitable, yeah.

13:08.341 --> 13:09.330
It's a lot of work.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.465
We made $200 tonight.

13:11.465 --> 13:13.063
- $200, for all this work?

13:13.063 --> 13:15.128
And are they all staying over?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.567
- Oh, no, most are locals.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.787
When they come for a murder mystery,

13:17.787 --> 13:19.716
they usually don't do an overnight.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.707
- [Gordon] Clearly tonight's
about feeding John's ego,

13:21.707 --> 13:23.324
not filling his bank account.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.067
- Oh, well, that could explain it.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.515
Oh, here now, here now.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.840
Oh, my word!

13:30.738 --> 13:33.031
- [Gordon] Oh my fucking god.

13:33.031 --> 13:35.072
- [Actor] Here, come to, sir.

13:35.072 --> 13:38.255
- Ladies and gentleman, it
appears the game is afoot.

13:38.255 --> 13:39.434
- The goal with the murder mysteries

13:39.434 --> 13:41.373
has always been to get people in,

13:41.373 --> 13:44.752
but if I'm not filling the
rooms, what's the point?

13:44.752 --> 13:47.108
(Tina sighs)

13:47.108 --> 13:47.976
- And I would have gotten away with it too

13:47.976 --> 13:50.246
if it wasn't for you and
your meddling guests.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.706
I'll be back, Sherlock Holmes.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.166
- Well, there you have it.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.449
Brilliant to all of you.

13:54.449 --> 13:57.274
(all clapping)

13:57.274 --> 13:58.672
- Thank goodness that's over.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.142
It's time to find out from John

14:00.142 --> 14:02.352
what on earth he thinks he's doing.

14:02.352 --> 14:04.271
Sit down, you must be shattered.

14:04.271 --> 14:05.209
- [Tina] I'm tired.

14:05.209 --> 14:06.262
- I bet you are.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.587
- [Tina] Stick a fork in me.

14:07.587 --> 14:08.455
- [Gordon] That was mad.

14:08.455 --> 14:09.324
- Was it mad?

14:09.324 --> 14:10.392
- Yeah.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.686
You're in the kitchen busting your ass off

14:12.686 --> 14:15.303
working hard to serve all those people.

14:15.303 --> 14:17.638
And, John, you were out prancing around

14:17.638 --> 14:18.870
like a sort of actor.

14:18.870 --> 14:20.506
- It's the thespian thing.

14:20.506 --> 14:22.696
- It's an inn, it's not a theatre.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.915
But you seem to enjoy it.

14:23.915 --> 14:27.648
- You have to force
yourself to like doing it.

14:27.648 --> 14:30.571
It's on stage for three hours, being...

14:32.716 --> 14:34.906
- The problems at the
Roosevelt are elementary.

14:34.906 --> 14:36.335
Can I just have a word
with you on your own.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.204
- Certainly.

14:37.204 --> 14:38.858
- [John] Oh, sure.

14:38.858 --> 14:40.828
- This place is sinking
because John refuses

14:40.828 --> 14:42.914
to take anything seriously.

14:42.914 --> 14:45.792
You love being an entertainer,

14:45.792 --> 14:48.783
don't you dare tell me
that that is hard work.

14:48.783 --> 14:49.652
- I don't hate it.

14:49.652 --> 14:52.381
- This whole fucking
thing was put together

14:52.381 --> 14:53.779
for your fantasy.

14:53.779 --> 14:56.365
- Well, that's kind of what this night is.

14:56.365 --> 14:57.501
It is entertainment.

14:57.501 --> 14:58.693
We put on a show.

15:00.869 --> 15:03.205
- You're pretending to be Sherlock Holmes,

15:03.205 --> 15:05.645
and upstairs we're empty.

15:05.645 --> 15:08.523
You're in the shit
financially, we're in ruins.

15:08.523 --> 15:10.358
And if you put the same amount of effort

15:10.358 --> 15:11.828
into filling this place,

15:11.828 --> 15:16.134
just one room booked tonight
would have made more profit

15:16.134 --> 15:17.375
than the whole murder mystery,

15:17.375 --> 15:19.492
and all that work that went into it.

15:19.492 --> 15:21.233
This is insane.

15:21.233 --> 15:23.885
And you prance around
like some fucking idiot,

15:24.777 --> 15:26.980
while your wife is slaving
away in the kitchen.

15:26.980 --> 15:29.849
Do you have any care in the
world, apart from yourself?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.276
- When you get a psychology degree...

15:32.276 --> 15:33.144
- Oh, when I get one.

15:33.144 --> 15:34.799
- ...you come and tell
me what's wrong with me.

15:34.799 --> 15:35.667
- Here we go.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.437
- You obviously think
you're a psychologist.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.001
- Big denial again.

15:39.001 --> 15:40.179
- No, I'm not in denial,

15:40.179 --> 15:41.910
I just don't know what you want.

15:41.910 --> 15:44.152
- It's only your own fucking stupidity

15:44.152 --> 15:46.217
to why we're in the shit this far.

15:46.217 --> 15:48.344
- Well, that is probably true.

15:48.344 --> 15:52.048
- So then man up, and act responsible.

15:53.401 --> 15:54.968
- Okay, I'm done with that.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.032
I'm done with that and you.

15:57.032 --> 15:58.038
- Oh, Sherlock!

15:58.916 --> 16:00.512
Does that massage your ego a bit more?

16:00.512 --> 16:02.598
- No, just talk to my hand.

16:02.598 --> 16:04.465
- Talk to my hand, what a fucking idiot.

16:04.465 --> 16:05.334
- [John] Have a good night.

16:05.334 --> 16:06.539
- [Gordon] You're not 10 years old,

16:06.539 --> 16:08.729
you need to grow up and stop
running away from the truth.

16:08.729 --> 16:09.597
(door bangs)

16:09.597 --> 16:11.189
(Gordon's hand slams)

16:11.189 --> 16:12.712
Fucking joke.

16:12.712 --> 16:15.026
(crashing)
(rain tapping)

16:15.026 --> 16:15.894
(upbeat music)

16:15.894 --> 16:18.176
It was a rough first day
at Idaho's Roosevelt Inn.

16:18.176 --> 16:19.044
(Gordon's fist thudding)

16:19.044 --> 16:19.913
Let me out!

16:19.913 --> 16:21.064
And last night proved to me

16:21.064 --> 16:23.087
that owner, John, needs
to stop dressing up.

16:23.087 --> 16:24.348
- Wait 'til I get going.

16:24.348 --> 16:25.610
- [Gordon] And start growing up.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.165
You prance around like some fucking idiot.

16:28.165 --> 16:30.532
And take some responsibility
for the problems at the Inn.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.763
It's only your own fucking stupidity

16:32.763 --> 16:34.452
to why we're in this shit.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.321
- I'm done with that.

16:35.321 --> 16:36.548
- [Gordon] But John didn't want to listen.

16:36.548 --> 16:37.417
- Just talk to my hand.

16:37.417 --> 16:40.698
- Oh, talk to my hand,
oh what a fucking idiot.

16:40.698 --> 16:42.837
(door bangs)
(Gordon's hand slams)

16:42.837 --> 16:45.234
(upbeat music)

16:45.234 --> 16:48.310
Today, I'm gonna have another
go at getting through to him

16:48.310 --> 16:51.014
before he heads into the
kitchen to prepare lunch.

16:52.085 --> 16:53.284
You're losing money,

16:53.284 --> 16:56.871
you're on this treadmill
of mistake after mistake.

16:56.871 --> 16:59.811
We may be in a elementary school,

16:59.811 --> 17:01.177
but you're not a child.

17:01.177 --> 17:02.397
And I would really wish

17:02.397 --> 17:05.486
if you stop acting like one
quickly, is that possible?

17:07.152 --> 17:08.246
- Sure.

17:08.246 --> 17:10.114
- Show me what you've got.

17:10.114 --> 17:10.983
- In the kitchen.

17:10.983 --> 17:12.146
I don't wanna cook for Gordon.

17:12.146 --> 17:14.430
First of all, he's got
a huge ego of his own,

17:14.430 --> 17:18.173
so nothing anybody else
does is gonna be any good.

17:18.173 --> 17:20.394
I don't even want to cook him a thing.

17:20.394 --> 17:22.094
- [Mariah] How we doing over here?

17:22.094 --> 17:23.521
- [Gordon] Word has
spread that I'm in town,

17:23.521 --> 17:24.877
and the dining room is full.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.921
We're all having the same
five-course set menu,

17:26.921 --> 17:29.330
cooked in the Inn's tiny kitchen.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.917
- Here's the shrimp
cocktail to start you off.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.114
- Thank you.

17:33.114 --> 17:34.678
That's gnarly, that's ghastly.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.797
The watery bits, what's that bit there?

17:37.797 --> 17:39.392
- [Mariah] That's
probably the tomato juice,

17:39.392 --> 17:42.208
unless it's condensation from the shrimp.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.418
- Condensation, was it frozen?

17:44.418 --> 17:45.524
- Yes.
(plates clanking)

17:45.524 --> 17:46.393
- Shit!

17:48.182 --> 17:50.789
Yes, warm, that's a sad looking shrimp.

17:50.789 --> 17:52.224
That's not a good start.

17:52.224 --> 17:54.063
- [Guest] That doesn't really
taste fresh, the shrimp

17:54.063 --> 17:56.826
- [Mariah] Okay, I will take that for you.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.517
- [Gordon] And everyone else,
seems to be hating it too.

17:59.517 --> 18:01.696
How can you fuck up a shrimp cocktail?

18:01.696 --> 18:02.707
(dramatic music)

18:02.707 --> 18:03.917
- Hey, here's Gordon's.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.533
- [Mariah] Pecan crusted salmon.

18:05.533 --> 18:06.617
- Is it fresh salmon?

18:06.617 --> 18:07.486
- [Mariah] Frozen.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.422
- Frozen, that has to be the
saddest looking plate of salmon

18:10.422 --> 18:13.148
anywhere in North America tonight.

18:16.449 --> 18:18.629
No seasoning, it's dreadful.

18:18.629 --> 18:19.846
It's bone dry.

18:20.737 --> 18:21.643
- [Mariah] Would you like
me to take it for you?

18:21.643 --> 18:22.811
- [Gordon] Yes, please.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.003
- [Mariah] I'm sorry,
I'll take care of it.

18:28.661 --> 18:31.256
- Tastes great to me.

18:31.256 --> 18:32.174
I'm gonna kill him.

18:32.174 --> 18:35.615
I just want Gordon to take a
long walk off a short pier.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.933
I want him to fall in to a very deep pit,

18:39.338 --> 18:40.873
so he can't get out.

18:42.424 --> 18:43.926
- [Gordon] This is pathetic.

18:43.926 --> 18:45.595
Can John cook anything?

18:45.595 --> 18:46.836
Can he cook an egg?

18:46.836 --> 18:48.242
- [Tina] He can cook an egg.

18:48.242 --> 18:50.170
- [Gordon] Could you ask
him just to boil me an egg?

18:50.170 --> 18:51.907
- Sure thing.
- [Gordon] A soft boiled egg.

18:51.907 --> 18:54.384
He can't possibly mess up
a soft boiled egg, can he?

18:54.384 --> 18:55.594
- [Tina] Soft boiled egg for Gordon.

18:55.594 --> 18:56.480
(pans clanking)

18:56.480 --> 18:57.348
- [John] Okay, what egg?

18:57.348 --> 18:58.722
- [Tina] Soft boiled egg.

18:58.722 --> 18:59.590
- What?

19:01.202 --> 19:03.584
I'm just going, wow.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.162
- No egg cup?

19:09.162 --> 19:10.031
- No.

19:10.031 --> 19:12.339
- I'll make my own egg
cup, fucking hells bells.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.042
(egg shell crunching)

19:17.042 --> 19:18.387
Oh, it's raw.

19:18.387 --> 19:19.732
Is this really happening?
(knife clanks)

19:19.732 --> 19:22.205
He can't even boil a fucking egg.

19:22.205 --> 19:23.402
(fist thudding)

19:23.402 --> 19:25.207
Fucking thing's still got feathers on it.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.794
(guests laughing)

19:27.794 --> 19:28.663
- [John] Could have probably cooked that

19:28.663 --> 19:30.247
another two minutes.

19:30.247 --> 19:32.291
(Gordon's head banging)

19:32.291 --> 19:35.769
- I am absolutely ready to boot
Gordon Ramsay out of my Inn.

19:38.657 --> 19:40.263
Fire away, buddy.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.588
- Are you having a laugh
at your family's expense?

19:42.588 --> 19:44.038
- No.

19:44.038 --> 19:46.373
- Big tall hat, big jacket,

19:46.373 --> 19:48.511
and you can't boil a fucking egg.

19:48.511 --> 19:50.443
- Do you want a fried egg?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.631
You want french toast too?

19:53.631 --> 19:55.059
How about some pancakes?

19:55.059 --> 19:56.623
- What the fuck are you doing?

19:58.073 --> 20:00.116
You don't care, do you?

20:00.116 --> 20:00.985
- I do care.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.171
- You're a fucking joke.

20:04.339 --> 20:07.791
- Those are what we refer
to as fighting words,

20:07.791 --> 20:08.739
gutsy thing to do,

20:08.739 --> 20:11.138
especially in a kitchen
full of sharp knives.

20:11.138 --> 20:12.973
It has never been a joke for me, ever.

20:12.973 --> 20:16.164
- Come play at my school,
I'm the headmaster.

20:16.164 --> 20:18.113
You're acting like an absolute idiot.

20:18.113 --> 20:20.397
- No, but you're in my house.

20:20.397 --> 20:23.056
- That's right, and I'm
disgusted at your performance.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.787
Your big problem is you
can't handle the truth.

20:24.787 --> 20:26.966
You don't like hearing it.

20:26.966 --> 20:28.269
- You don't even know me.

20:29.681 --> 20:30.838
What?
- It's just a joke.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.346
Think about your wife.

20:32.346 --> 20:36.111
You're in to $1.1 million of debt.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.883
You're forcing her to live in hell.

20:37.883 --> 20:39.875
She's telling me that.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.878
Just think over the last 13 years

20:42.878 --> 20:46.600
of what you've fucking
done, and not to you,

20:46.600 --> 20:48.738
to everyone else standing behind you.

20:48.738 --> 20:51.316
- I'm tired to hearing that,
I don't need it anymore.

20:52.815 --> 20:54.191
Screw it!

20:54.191 --> 20:57.152
I really don't care if he leaves.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.557
- Fuck me!
(door clicking)

21:00.557 --> 21:02.735
(musical blast)

21:02.735 --> 21:03.740
(electrics hissing)
(rain tapping)

21:05.300 --> 21:07.068
(upbeat music)

21:07.068 --> 21:08.820
I had a horrible night's
sleep on the couch,

21:08.820 --> 21:10.577
because I couldn't sleep in my bed.

21:10.577 --> 21:11.446
(curtain squeaking)

21:11.446 --> 21:12.887
I really needed a hot shower.

21:14.795 --> 21:18.173
Ah, shit, fucking hell,
this water's freezing.

21:18.173 --> 21:19.748
I need to open John's eyes.

21:19.748 --> 21:22.125
But he walks out every
time things get difficult.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.637
So I've got another plan.

21:23.637 --> 21:24.857
Have you got two minutes?

21:24.857 --> 21:25.725
- [Tina] We do.

21:25.725 --> 21:28.037
- There's something I'd like to show you

21:28.037 --> 21:29.559
both in my room.

21:29.559 --> 21:31.030
- [John] Oh crap!

21:31.030 --> 21:36.003
What now, what's wrong now?

21:36.003 --> 21:36.872
- Please come through.

21:36.872 --> 21:38.001
- Oh!

21:38.001 --> 21:40.925
(dramatic musical blast)

21:40.925 --> 21:44.314
There's the jury, and
they're going to hang us.

21:44.314 --> 21:45.245
- Clearly you recognise
some of your guests

21:45.245 --> 21:46.931
from the past six months..

21:46.931 --> 21:47.800
- We do.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.091
- I think feedback is critical.

21:51.091 --> 21:52.794
First impressions
walking through the door?

21:52.794 --> 21:53.719
- There's a lot of decorations.

21:53.719 --> 21:54.783
- [Guest] It's kind of outdated.

21:54.783 --> 21:55.651
- Outdated.

21:55.651 --> 21:58.171
- Too much, a lot going on at once.

21:58.171 --> 22:00.069
- I'd like to go onto the food.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.237
The general consensus?

22:01.237 --> 22:02.499
- Disappointing.
- Yes.

22:02.499 --> 22:05.755
- It was, it wasn't the
value that we paid honestly.

22:07.024 --> 22:09.151
- Show of hands, how many of you

22:09.151 --> 22:11.237
would return and stay here again please?

22:14.052 --> 22:15.720
None of our guests would return.

22:18.108 --> 22:21.601
- I'm speechless, I didn't expect this.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.718
I thought we were better than that.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.584
- That's the most valuable information

22:25.584 --> 22:27.180
you've had in 13 years.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.150
- I thought we were a
lot better than this,

22:29.150 --> 22:32.164
that is a view that is changing.

22:32.164 --> 22:35.024
- You've got to put yourself
in the guest's position.

22:37.012 --> 22:38.892
You've given me feedback
on everything you've seen

22:38.892 --> 22:39.761
and experienced.

22:39.761 --> 22:40.630
But there's something
I'd like to point out

22:40.630 --> 22:43.032
that none of you have seen, please.

22:45.032 --> 22:48.221
(case clicking)

22:48.221 --> 22:51.089
Would you be so kind to put
a pair of these on, please.

22:52.048 --> 22:56.177
- Oh my gosh, can this
just get any more terrible,

22:56.177 --> 22:57.275
I don't think so.

22:58.179 --> 22:59.913
- [Gordon] Glasses on.

22:59.913 --> 23:02.308
(suspenseful music)

23:02.308 --> 23:04.738
Okay, this black light is gonna show up

23:04.738 --> 23:06.107
any bodily fluids.

23:08.878 --> 23:11.414
Let's start with the pillow, shall we?

23:13.931 --> 23:15.614
(all gasping)

23:15.614 --> 23:16.657
- Oh my God!

23:18.397 --> 23:19.871
Like someone urinated on it.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.641
- [Gordon] Absolutely disgusting.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.227
If you think that's bad.

23:27.169 --> 23:28.811
(all gasping)

23:28.811 --> 23:31.537
This kind of stuff hasn't been weeks,

23:31.537 --> 23:32.446
that's years.

23:33.561 --> 23:36.791
(all gasping)

23:36.791 --> 23:39.356
- Absolutely hideous, horrified,

23:39.356 --> 23:44.163
disgusted, grossed out,
kinda want to go vomit.

23:44.163 --> 23:46.467
- [Guest] You kind of trust
that things are gonna be...

23:46.467 --> 23:47.739
- You have the right to expect that.

23:47.739 --> 23:48.608
- You have that.

23:48.608 --> 23:50.523
- This is just as bad
as it can possibly be.

23:50.523 --> 23:51.767
I mean, I'm disgusted.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.678
- [Gordon] How does that make you feel?

23:56.678 --> 23:59.053
- It makes me actually
feel sick to my stomach

23:59.053 --> 23:59.921
that I slept in that.

23:59.921 --> 24:00.790
- Glad I took a shower,

24:00.790 --> 24:02.754
but now I'm wondering about the shower.

24:03.641 --> 24:05.123
- I'll let you go, thank you.

24:05.123 --> 24:06.146
- Thank you.

24:06.146 --> 24:07.937
- Thank you all very much, thank you.

24:07.937 --> 24:11.110
This is me, I've put my
heart and soul into this.

24:12.172 --> 24:13.518
It's just so embarrassing.

24:14.881 --> 24:16.424
(Tina sniffing)

24:16.424 --> 24:18.750
- I had to do this, because
you weren't listening to me.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.929
And John just laughs at every problem.

24:20.929 --> 24:22.235
- I understand.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.237
I understand now.

24:26.175 --> 24:28.563
(door squeaking)

24:28.563 --> 24:29.606
(door banging)

24:29.606 --> 24:33.483
(melancholy music)

24:33.483 --> 24:35.037
- I'm worried about Tina.

24:35.037 --> 24:37.424
Hearing from the guests
and seeing those stains

24:37.424 --> 24:39.343
seemed to hit her pretty hard.

24:39.343 --> 24:40.212
- [Gordon] Tina?

24:40.212 --> 24:41.080
- [Tina] Yes.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.856
- Have you got two secs?

24:42.856 --> 24:45.797
Come on, I'm not here to hurt
you, I'm here to help you.

24:45.797 --> 24:48.727
I'm just banging my head
against the wall with John.

24:48.727 --> 24:51.001
- [Tina] I know what we do is not perfect,

24:51.001 --> 24:53.764
but I thought what we
did was better than that.

24:53.764 --> 24:56.464
- John's gotta get out of his bubble.

24:56.464 --> 24:59.728
He's an innkeeper, but
he's constantly joking

24:59.728 --> 25:02.105
and shrugging responsibility.

25:02.105 --> 25:05.247
And now he has to start
looking at himself.

25:07.329 --> 25:09.613
- The thing that probably
bothers me the most

25:09.613 --> 25:12.376
is John just refuses to understand my need

25:12.376 --> 25:14.649
to have my part of the dream.

25:14.649 --> 25:16.808
I don't like living and eating

25:16.808 --> 25:18.653
and breathing my work 24/7,

25:18.653 --> 25:23.119
and never ever having a place
to go that I can get away.

25:25.421 --> 25:26.839
- You're not happy?

25:26.839 --> 25:27.708
- No,

25:30.895 --> 25:33.407
I'm not.
(Tina sniffing)

25:33.407 --> 25:35.284
At the end of the day I
usually lay down in the bed

25:35.284 --> 25:37.714
and I know this isn't what I wanted.

25:39.486 --> 25:42.729
And I'd leave here tomorrow if
I could leave here tomorrow.

25:42.729 --> 25:45.338
I'm ready to just walk away
from this and just forget it.

25:45.338 --> 25:48.475
I wanna leave, I wanna get
out of here, and go away.

25:48.475 --> 25:51.832
- You can't give up 13
years of being unhappy,

25:51.832 --> 25:53.688
it's no a molehill, it's a mountain.

25:53.688 --> 25:56.222
You have a voice, you've got to stand up.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.060
You absolutely have the right to be happy.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.810
I mean that.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.142
- I guess maybe I needed somebody to say,

26:03.142 --> 26:07.786
"You have a right to be
happy", so that was good.

26:07.786 --> 26:10.299
- Thank you.
- [Tina] You're welcome.

26:10.299 --> 26:11.522
- [Gordon] I'll see you later.

26:11.522 --> 26:14.939
I promise you I'll make a
difference, and I mean that.

26:17.965 --> 26:21.605
(whooshing)
(rain tapping)

26:21.605 --> 26:23.885
(upbeat music)

26:23.885 --> 26:27.232
Last night, John's wife Tina
was at a breaking point.

26:27.232 --> 26:29.028
So you're not happy?

26:29.028 --> 26:30.631
- No,

26:30.631 --> 26:33.217
and I'd leave here tomorrow if
I could leave here tomorrow.

26:33.217 --> 26:37.148
- After talking, I realised
how bad things really are here,

26:37.148 --> 26:38.650
and I promised to make things better,

26:38.650 --> 26:41.642
because Tina truly deserves to be happy.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.511
Good morning, darling.

26:42.511 --> 26:43.380
- Good morning.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.248
- [Gordon] How are you?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.849
- I'm here.

26:46.849 --> 26:47.717
- [Gordon] You're here.

26:47.717 --> 26:49.244
(Tina laughing)

26:49.244 --> 26:50.311
Let's catch up, shall we,

26:50.311 --> 26:51.748
let's get out of this little cubby hole.

26:51.748 --> 26:53.237
- Okay.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.010
- Maybe downstairs.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.762
I can't believe that John and Tina

26:56.762 --> 27:00.234
have spent $60,000 on a
ballroom that they never use,

27:00.234 --> 27:02.100
and smells like dog.

27:02.100 --> 27:07.314
Looking at this inn, there's
a huge missed opportunity.

27:07.773 --> 27:10.640
The potential of this
room is extraordinary.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.730
And this has to be used
as a way to get people

27:13.730 --> 27:16.523
into the bedrooms
upstairs, and make money.

27:16.523 --> 27:17.918
- Exactly.

27:17.918 --> 27:19.736
- How often do you use this room?

27:21.317 --> 27:22.423
- Twice a month.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.166
- [Gordon] That's crazy.
- [Tina] It is.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.104
- Have you ever thought about
employing a wedding planner

27:26.104 --> 27:28.064
to actually book this place out?

27:28.064 --> 27:29.628
- I have one I'm working with,

27:30.954 --> 27:33.382
been working with her for
just about a year now.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.300
I don't pay her a salary,

27:35.300 --> 27:38.136
it's her wedding, if it's for
a wedding, we both get paid.

27:38.136 --> 27:40.910
So she's motivated to sell it.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.693
- For me it's a big missed opportunity.

27:42.693 --> 27:45.029
Once you've held an amazing wedding,

27:45.029 --> 27:47.667
and you've got such great feedback,

27:47.667 --> 27:48.754
it just spreads.

27:49.888 --> 27:52.442
Okay, there's more I wanna
see, I'll see you later.

27:52.442 --> 27:54.208
- [Tina] Okay, all right, thank you.

27:55.748 --> 27:57.138
- This does not stack up.

27:58.323 --> 27:59.595
I'm going to go and meet
the wedding planner,

27:59.595 --> 28:01.152
because there must be something

28:01.152 --> 28:03.278
that John and Tina aren't tell me.

28:03.278 --> 28:05.625
(upbeat music)

28:05.625 --> 28:07.249
(car door bangs)

28:07.249 --> 28:08.117
Hello, how are you?

28:08.117 --> 28:09.157
- Hi, nice to meet you.

28:09.157 --> 28:10.815
- [Gordon] Likewise, where shall we start?

28:10.815 --> 28:12.400
- You wanna come on over
and we'll have a seat?

28:12.400 --> 28:13.268
- Shall we?

28:13.268 --> 28:14.196
- Yes, come on over.

28:15.486 --> 28:19.553
- The Roosevelt, what would
you say the key problems are?

28:19.553 --> 28:23.226
- It's dated, it's hard
to sell 10 day old bread.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.007
Brides are young, they're sophisticated,

28:26.007 --> 28:27.165
they're on their phones,

28:27.165 --> 28:30.407
they're seeing what the
rest of the world is doing.

28:30.407 --> 28:31.700
A big thing with selling the ballroom

28:31.700 --> 28:35.402
is the colours, that only
matches a tiny percentage.

28:35.402 --> 28:38.217
You can either go burgundy,
ivory or navy blue.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.063
And those colours are so dated anyway.

28:40.063 --> 28:40.931
- Darn.

28:40.931 --> 28:42.242
- It's terrible.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.995
And then you walk
downstairs and the smell.

28:44.995 --> 28:47.463
I had one girl literally
say, "I've gotta go upstairs,

28:47.463 --> 28:49.708
"the smell is gonna make me sick."

28:49.708 --> 28:52.002
- John doesn't strike me as someone

28:52.002 --> 28:54.004
that I'd want to put my
wedding in his hands.

28:54.004 --> 28:55.777
As a host, how is he?

28:55.777 --> 28:58.467
- We have had some issues last summer

28:58.467 --> 29:00.075
with him coming out and dancing.

29:00.075 --> 29:01.261
(waltz music)

29:01.261 --> 29:02.752
- At the guest's wedding?

29:02.752 --> 29:04.608
- Yes.
- Like ballroom dancing, or?

29:04.608 --> 29:05.716
- It was more like
(record scratching)

29:05.716 --> 29:06.584
(pop music)

29:06.584 --> 29:08.737
Macarena type line dancing style.

29:08.737 --> 29:10.458
- Oh my God.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.334
How awkward was that?

29:11.334 --> 29:12.807
- It was mortifying.

29:15.056 --> 29:18.674
- If you just bear with me
whilst I make some changes,

29:18.674 --> 29:22.731
because you are the key to
their success going forwards.

29:22.731 --> 29:24.607
Would you give them one more chance?

29:28.140 --> 29:30.356
- Okay, I'm in.

29:30.356 --> 29:31.798
- Thank you, good to see you too.

29:31.798 --> 29:33.048
- Good to see you.
(lips smacking)

29:33.048 --> 29:34.873
- Thank you, darling.

29:35.963 --> 29:38.179
Now that Misty's on board
to help the Roosevelt,

29:38.179 --> 29:39.949
I'm gonna make one last attempt

29:39.949 --> 29:41.920
to see if John is ready to change.

29:43.632 --> 29:45.323
How you feeling?

29:45.323 --> 29:46.452
(John puffs)

29:46.452 --> 29:49.252
I'm not here to hurt your feelings, John.

29:49.252 --> 29:53.365
But you have a huge defence mechanism.

29:53.365 --> 29:54.846
- I have an attitude.

29:54.846 --> 29:55.715
- I want to help,

29:55.715 --> 30:00.675
but you are a very tough,
stubborn, selfish individual

30:00.675 --> 30:01.655
to get through to.

30:01.655 --> 30:03.553
- Yeah, truth hurts.

30:03.553 --> 30:04.700
- It's not a sign of weakness

30:04.700 --> 30:06.667
to put your hand up and ask for help.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.792
And I don't wanna butt heads.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.565
- I don't wanna butt heads either.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.360
Gordon, I've got two options here,

30:19.360 --> 30:22.071
I can close up the
business, walk away from it,

30:22.071 --> 30:23.948
give it to the bank.

30:23.948 --> 30:28.077
The other option is I know
I've done this to myself,

30:28.077 --> 30:29.433
I've done this to my wife,

30:30.528 --> 30:32.373
I've gotta find a way to get out of it.

30:32.373 --> 30:34.198
- This has been your dream, your ambition,

30:34.198 --> 30:36.471
and she just followed suit.

30:36.471 --> 30:37.503
- You're correct.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.974
- You have one amazing loyal lady there.

30:39.974 --> 30:41.539
- I don't deserve her (puffs).

30:43.874 --> 30:46.585
I'm a pig sometimes, there's
just no doubt about it.

30:49.327 --> 30:50.923
I'm trying to change that.

30:50.923 --> 30:52.633
She's not the one that should be suffering

30:52.633 --> 30:54.301
because of what I did.

30:54.301 --> 30:57.307
And I haven't even
considered that in years.

30:58.430 --> 31:01.569
- Let's start making this place better.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.800
I need you committed.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.573
- I want the help, I
want to make this work.

31:07.573 --> 31:10.244
(dramatic music)

31:10.244 --> 31:13.623
- [Gordon] Coming up, has
John's change come too late?

31:13.623 --> 31:15.763
- I've quit dreaming.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.931
(doors banging)
(rain tapping)

31:20.931 --> 31:23.778
(upbeat music)

31:23.778 --> 31:26.031
- [Gordon] Now that John's
finally turned the corner.

31:26.031 --> 31:28.148
- I'm a pig sometimes,
I'm trying to change that.

31:28.148 --> 31:29.733
- [Gordon] It's time to sit down with Tina

31:29.733 --> 31:31.484
and get to the heart
of their relationship.

31:31.484 --> 31:32.447
- I'm so pleased that
we've got to the place

31:32.447 --> 31:35.843
that we can start making
steps in the right direction.

31:35.843 --> 31:37.980
This is a family run inn,

31:37.980 --> 31:40.326
and you need your time out,

31:40.326 --> 31:43.413
you need to cut your dear lady slack.

31:43.413 --> 31:45.811
You need to learn the importance
of being a happy couple.

31:45.811 --> 31:48.178
What have you got to say now?

31:48.178 --> 31:50.701
- We've been so wrapped up in this,

31:50.701 --> 31:52.151
and everything we do, that

31:55.987 --> 32:00.420
I just don't even know where
to go with romance anymore.

32:01.349 --> 32:05.448
I'm so self-consumed with all of this.

32:07.315 --> 32:12.306
- Just the ability to just
have a conversation with you

32:12.306 --> 32:14.965
understanding my feelings.

32:14.965 --> 32:17.416
I have wishes, ambitions,
there are things that

32:18.761 --> 32:20.328
are important to me,

32:21.993 --> 32:24.026
they're vitally important to me.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.164
You have to support that.

32:26.164 --> 32:28.062
- If you're not prepared
to support each other,

32:28.062 --> 32:29.469
in each other's roles,

32:29.469 --> 32:31.106
then it's never ever going to work.

32:31.106 --> 32:32.827
You need to be happy together.

32:32.827 --> 32:35.976
- I want to know what
your dreams are again.

32:35.976 --> 32:40.406
I haven't heard a dream from you in years,

32:40.406 --> 32:42.263
I don't even know what
your dreams are anymore.

32:42.263 --> 32:44.070
- I don't know what my dreams are anymore.

32:45.350 --> 32:47.748
I've quit dreaming.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.303
- I want you to start dreaming again,

32:50.303 --> 32:52.496
and then I want you to
share those dreams with me.

32:53.615 --> 32:54.606
Because I love you.

32:55.704 --> 32:57.268
- I know you do.

32:57.268 --> 33:00.188
- Told all my girls they were princesses,

33:00.188 --> 33:01.473
and you are too.

33:02.542 --> 33:05.420
I haven't treated you much like royalty.

33:05.420 --> 33:06.288
(lips smacking)

33:06.288 --> 33:08.832
- I do feel like Gordon has helped John

33:08.832 --> 33:14.045
appreciate me more, and see
what's going in inside of here

33:14.108 --> 33:15.685
should matter to him.

33:17.883 --> 33:18.752
(upbeat music)

33:18.752 --> 33:19.621
- [Gordon] Now that they're talking again,

33:19.621 --> 33:21.511
I want to give Tina and John
a lesson in something else

33:21.511 --> 33:23.982
they've not done well for a long time,

33:23.982 --> 33:24.851
cooking.

33:25.859 --> 33:30.520
- In any inn, country hotel,
it's all about comfort.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.887
And what I learned immediately from you

33:32.887 --> 33:36.286
is that you're trying way too hard.

33:36.286 --> 33:38.288
You've got a shoebox
(fist knocking)

33:38.288 --> 33:40.634
of a kitchen that you
can't swing a cat in.

33:40.634 --> 33:43.888
You shouldn't be cooking
five course meals in there.

33:43.888 --> 33:44.920
You're not a chef.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.788
- No, I'm not.

33:45.788 --> 33:46.734
- [Gordon] You shouldn't
be on a billboard.

33:46.734 --> 33:47.603
- I shouldn't be.

33:47.603 --> 33:48.840
- A delicious home cooked meal,

33:48.840 --> 33:50.216
that's all I'd expect to see,

33:50.216 --> 33:51.084
that's all I expect to smell

33:51.084 --> 33:52.417
when you come through that door.

33:52.417 --> 33:57.630
So I've put together a list
of dishes for the whole week,

33:57.693 --> 33:59.642
something you can cook in one pot.

33:59.642 --> 34:00.633
- Fabulous.

34:00.633 --> 34:02.062
- Let it cook itself.

34:02.062 --> 34:03.188
- Really fabulous.

34:03.188 --> 34:05.159
- These are my recipes, I'm proud of them.

34:05.159 --> 34:07.703
Don't start improvising,
changing, just follow them,

34:07.703 --> 34:08.975
they will work.

34:08.975 --> 34:11.134
Half an hour to get the chilli on, yeah.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.208
- Fabulous.
- Sweet!

34:12.208 --> 34:14.522
- Nobody comes here, John, Tina,

34:14.522 --> 34:16.054
expecting a five course meal.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.984
- The food was an amazing discovery

34:17.984 --> 34:21.686
that it could be so simple,
so easy, so delicious.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.688
I'm glad that Gordon is in my kitchen.

34:23.688 --> 34:25.324
- [Gordon] Tomorrow's a
new dawn for the Roosevelt,

34:25.324 --> 34:27.878
and my goodness, are
we gonna turn the page.

34:27.878 --> 34:29.205
(enchanted music)

34:29.205 --> 34:31.143
My team worked all
night to bring the hotel

34:31.143 --> 34:33.260
into the 21st century.

34:33.260 --> 34:36.221
Now it's time to reveal
the new Roosevelt Inn.

34:36.221 --> 34:37.090
Good morning.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.264
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Gordon.

34:39.264 --> 34:41.476
- You've got a spring in your step, John.

34:41.476 --> 34:42.518
How you feeling?

34:42.518 --> 34:43.388
- Wonderful.

34:43.388 --> 34:44.688
- [Gordon] Good, let's go.

34:44.688 --> 34:46.074
Come in, come in, please.

34:46.074 --> 34:51.286
Okay, 16 rooms, 32 guests,
this hotel should be full.

34:51.288 --> 34:52.779
Welcome to your new honeymoon suite.

34:52.779 --> 34:54.774
- Oh wow!

34:56.012 --> 34:57.534
- [Tina] Oh my goodness.

34:57.534 --> 34:59.510
- John, how do you feel?

34:59.510 --> 35:00.965
(John laughs)

35:00.965 --> 35:02.477
- It's incredible, Gordon.

35:02.477 --> 35:07.304
- A honeymoon suite,
decluttered, bright, elegant.

35:07.304 --> 35:10.662
- We were literally two
centuries back in time

35:10.662 --> 35:12.361
with what we were doing in these rooms.

35:12.361 --> 35:15.573
And we are suddenly into now, today.

35:15.573 --> 35:16.929
It's amazing.

35:18.107 --> 35:20.714
- John and Tina, I'd like
you both to go upstairs.

35:23.973 --> 35:26.355
- Oh my, this is just classy.

35:26.355 --> 35:29.222
- [Gordon] A room that will
be great for room service,

35:29.222 --> 35:30.849
to have a bit of romance.

35:30.849 --> 35:32.848
- Oh, this is just truly beautiful.

35:32.848 --> 35:35.322
- Now, coupled with selling those rooms,

35:35.322 --> 35:40.066
the big asset that was
underused in many ways

35:40.066 --> 35:41.380
was downstairs.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.319
- [Tina] Truly, that's been
a huge disappointment for me.

35:43.319 --> 35:44.602
- Come with me now, and let me show you

35:44.602 --> 35:48.614
the new stunning Roosevelt wedding space.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.483
- [Tina] Yay!

35:49.483 --> 35:52.235
I thought we had something
that would be viable

35:52.235 --> 35:53.319
to help build our business.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.927
And it wasn't, it was dragging it down.

35:55.927 --> 35:57.990
- Oh, good grief, oh!

35:57.990 --> 35:59.505
- [Tina] Oh, my word.

35:59.505 --> 36:00.944
Look at this.

36:02.276 --> 36:03.916
Okay, this is stunning.

36:03.916 --> 36:06.563
- [John] This is amazing.

36:06.563 --> 36:08.213
Absolutely amazing.

36:09.138 --> 36:10.970
I love the colour scheme.

36:10.970 --> 36:13.433
- [Tina] This is stunning, oh my gosh.

36:13.433 --> 36:16.081
- This is the direction
we need to be going in.

36:16.081 --> 36:18.104
This is the next step up,

36:18.104 --> 36:20.148
and I am extremely grateful.

36:20.148 --> 36:23.194
- And I don't wanna see
a dog, a dog's hair,

36:23.194 --> 36:25.090
a dog's chew anywhere in this space.

36:25.090 --> 36:25.959
- Understood.

36:25.959 --> 36:27.291
- Now this room should propel

36:27.291 --> 36:28.959
this business to greater heights.

36:28.959 --> 36:31.368
It has to be your biggest marketing tool,

36:31.368 --> 36:33.224
because when you've
got the wedding booked,

36:33.224 --> 36:36.049
the guests should book
every room upstairs.

36:36.049 --> 36:38.249
- This space and the revenue it can bring

36:38.249 --> 36:39.668
into the Roosevelt,

36:39.668 --> 36:41.388
can definitely be the game changer

36:41.388 --> 36:42.869
that we've been looking for.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.735
- I'd like to point your attention

36:44.735 --> 36:46.153
to those wonderful plates,

36:46.153 --> 36:48.030
and all the glassware on the tables.

36:49.438 --> 36:52.673
That's a special gift
to you worth $50,000.

36:54.411 --> 36:55.280
- [Tina] No way!

36:55.280 --> 36:56.149
- [John] Really?

36:57.352 --> 37:00.543
- You've now got a solid foundation

37:00.543 --> 37:02.941
to host the most amazing wedding.

37:02.941 --> 37:03.809
- Beautiful, beautiful.

37:03.809 --> 37:06.017
- Now, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.200
You may recognise this lady.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.712
- [Tina] Yay (claps).

37:12.712 --> 37:15.133
- [John] Misty, look at our new space.

37:17.069 --> 37:19.165
I hope Misty's gonna
give us a second chance.

37:19.165 --> 37:20.782
- What strikes you now
walking through that room,

37:20.782 --> 37:22.536
what's the first thing that hits you?

37:22.536 --> 37:25.140
- It's natural, it's modern,

37:25.140 --> 37:26.892
it's what the brides are looking for.

37:26.892 --> 37:28.883
They're sophisticated, they're young.

37:28.883 --> 37:29.752
This is what they want.

37:29.752 --> 37:32.053
- And does it show versatility,

37:32.053 --> 37:34.462
the way that it can be adapted
to suit different colours?

37:34.462 --> 37:37.048
- Absolutely, we can put
any colour in this room

37:37.048 --> 37:38.613
and it'll be wonderful.

37:38.613 --> 37:39.481
- Yay!

37:39.481 --> 37:41.417
- This is gonna sell itself.

37:41.417 --> 37:42.285
- How does it smell?

37:42.285 --> 37:43.910
- It smells wonderful.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.827
(all laughing)

37:45.827 --> 37:47.287
- Now, here's the good news,

37:47.287 --> 37:51.458
she is prepared to give
you one more chance

37:51.458 --> 37:54.440
to become Coeur d'Alene's number one venue

37:54.440 --> 37:56.077
for hosting weddings.

37:56.077 --> 37:58.830
One more surprise, John and Tina.

37:58.830 --> 38:01.155
Misty's not just here to visit,

38:01.155 --> 38:03.887
the Roosevelt is hosting
a wedding tonight.

38:03.887 --> 38:05.671
- Tonight!

38:05.671 --> 38:08.539
(dramatic music)

38:09.989 --> 38:11.931
(rain tapping)

38:13.364 --> 38:14.815
(upbeat music)

38:14.815 --> 38:16.639
- [Gordon] Owners of the
Roosevelt Inn, John and Tina,

38:16.639 --> 38:18.610
have come a long way from
when I first met them.

38:18.610 --> 38:19.579
Personally...

38:19.579 --> 38:20.448
- [John] Because I love you.

38:20.448 --> 38:21.456
- [Gordon] ... and professionally.

38:21.456 --> 38:23.372
- I want to make this work.

38:23.372 --> 38:24.793
- [Gordon] And I've just surprised them

38:24.793 --> 38:26.805
with a true test to their business.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.249
The Roosevelt is hosting
a wedding tonight.

38:31.508 --> 38:32.377
- Wow!

38:33.458 --> 38:34.480
- Tonight!

38:34.480 --> 38:36.806
- When Gordon said we
had a wedding tonight,

38:36.806 --> 38:39.891
instant gut clenching terror.

38:39.891 --> 38:41.581
- You're gonna be cooking, serving,

38:41.581 --> 38:43.440
just simple elegant food.

38:44.688 --> 38:46.397
Good luck.

38:46.397 --> 38:49.360
(dramatic music)

38:49.360 --> 38:52.550
(wheels crunching)

38:52.550 --> 38:53.607
- [Tina] Are you my bride?

38:53.607 --> 38:54.476
- I'm the bride.

38:54.476 --> 38:56.742
- [Tina] Hello, welcome,
let me just take you ladies

38:56.742 --> 38:57.653
up to the rooms.

38:57.653 --> 38:59.454
All right, go on in, ladies.

38:59.454 --> 39:02.308
- [Woman] Oh, I like that bed.

39:02.308 --> 39:03.781
- Oh, my dress.

39:03.781 --> 39:04.854
- The guests are just starting to arrive.

39:04.854 --> 39:05.723
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.837
- [Gordon] I gave John and
Tiny a couple of simple

39:08.837 --> 39:10.328
but delicious wedding recipes,

39:10.328 --> 39:11.962
that they could cook
in their tiny kitchen.

39:11.962 --> 39:14.530
And that I knew the guests would love.

39:14.530 --> 39:17.033
- This evening is going to be huge for us,

39:17.033 --> 39:20.860
You're feeling that really
wound up sense inside yourself,

39:20.860 --> 39:22.538
it's like, holy cow!

39:22.538 --> 39:23.531
(harp notes)

39:23.531 --> 39:26.312
(elegant music)

39:33.351 --> 39:35.384
- Donald, Nicole...

39:35.384 --> 39:38.064
- [Gordon] As the couple
exchange their vows downstairs,

39:38.064 --> 39:39.297
upstairs in the kitchen,

39:39.297 --> 39:42.433
John and Tina are proving
they are there for each other

39:42.433 --> 39:44.122
when it matters.

39:44.122 --> 39:45.572
- [Official] I give you all that I am.

39:45.572 --> 39:46.990
- I give you all that I am.

39:46.990 --> 39:48.345
- You may kiss your bride.

39:49.479 --> 39:50.952
(guests clapping)

39:50.952 --> 39:53.559
- You're that side, I'm
this side, and we go bang.

39:54.444 --> 39:55.477
And then we go bang.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.678
- [Misty] Okay, I need
plates and hands, guys,

39:57.678 --> 39:58.546
they're downstairs.
- Yeah, coming now.

39:58.546 --> 39:59.857
- [Misty] Plates and hands, serve it up.

39:59.857 --> 40:01.181
- [Gordon] Okay, ladies, let's go.

40:01.181 --> 40:02.589
- [Misty] Grab them and go.

40:03.976 --> 40:05.216
- [Gordon] For the first time ever,

40:05.216 --> 40:07.104
the food at the Roosevelt
was putting a smile

40:07.104 --> 40:08.928
on people's faces.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.420
Try and bunch them up a little bit.

40:10.420 --> 40:11.785
Just make it look so much neater.

40:11.785 --> 40:12.912
Including Tina's.

40:12.912 --> 40:15.748
- Breathe and talk, and
okay, I've got this.

40:15.748 --> 40:17.103
- [John] Awesome.

40:17.103 --> 40:18.511
We're a nice rotation here.

40:20.909 --> 40:22.411
- [Gordon] John and Tina are a great team

40:22.411 --> 40:24.027
when they communicate properly.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.384
And I think the buzz they get from tonight

40:27.384 --> 40:29.949
will encourage them to keep
working on their relationship.

40:29.949 --> 40:30.818
- How you doing?

40:30.818 --> 40:32.733
- [John] We're rocking along here.

40:32.733 --> 40:35.458
- [Misty] I love it, plates
are going away steaming.

40:35.458 --> 40:37.082
- It's the best thing I've ever had.

40:37.082 --> 40:37.950
- [Gordon] Well done.

40:37.950 --> 40:38.967
- Okay!

40:38.967 --> 40:39.886
- [Gordon] How do you feel?
(Tina laughs)

40:39.886 --> 40:40.783
Where's John?

40:40.783 --> 40:42.160
Well done.
- [John] Thank you.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.130
- First time you've actually cooked...

40:44.130 --> 40:44.999
- Yes.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.038
- ...from scratch.
- From scratch.

40:46.038 --> 40:47.979
- For an amazing wedding,
well done, both of you.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.450
- [Tina] Thank you.

40:49.450 --> 40:50.319
- [Gordon] It's been a great night

40:50.319 --> 40:52.868
thanks to John and Tina's teamwork.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.809
- You guys did it, even ahead of schedule.

40:55.809 --> 40:56.677
You can do this.

40:56.677 --> 40:58.895
- I'm really hoping that
our future with Misty

40:58.895 --> 41:02.586
and our wedding business
just goes through the roof.

41:02.586 --> 41:06.173
- Time to go, I'm gonna be a
bit sad to leave this place.

41:06.173 --> 41:10.229
I think John and Tina have
done a bloody good job tonight.

41:10.229 --> 41:13.274
And more importantly, I
think the whole wedding

41:13.274 --> 41:14.670
has opened their eyes

41:14.670 --> 41:16.614
to the huge potential they've got here.

41:17.612 --> 41:20.761
(case clicking)

41:20.761 --> 41:22.627
Tonight the Roosevelt is fully booked

41:22.627 --> 41:24.056
for the first time in years.

41:24.056 --> 41:27.069
And the Inn is back on course for success.

41:27.069 --> 41:28.279
It's been a hell of a week, yeah?

41:28.279 --> 41:29.566
- [John] Yes.

41:29.566 --> 41:31.980
- And tonight proved that
you both can pull this off.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.837
- Once we got the system
going, it went very well.

41:34.837 --> 41:36.255
- Stick together.

41:36.255 --> 41:38.216
- All right, we'll do it, like glue.

41:38.216 --> 41:39.759
- You've got ever chance now.

41:39.759 --> 41:43.356
Good luck, you can have a happy
ever after, let me tell you.

41:43.356 --> 41:44.506
- Thank you so much.

41:46.662 --> 41:48.008
- Take care of yourself.

41:48.008 --> 41:48.876
- Thank you, again.

41:48.876 --> 41:51.072
- Do not sneak downstairs
to that dance floor.

41:51.072 --> 41:52.688
- Not even heading in that direction.

41:52.688 --> 41:54.148
- [Gordon] Yes, night night.

42:02.501 --> 42:03.370
- Oh, man,

42:05.138 --> 42:07.860
so gorgeous.

42:07.860 --> 42:09.632
Oh, there's an upstairs.

42:09.632 --> 42:10.894
- Thank you, Gordon Ramsay,

42:10.894 --> 42:12.688
for giving us this opportunity.

42:12.688 --> 42:16.462
- This experience obviously
is not meant to be easy,

42:16.462 --> 42:18.913
but in the end, we're there.

42:18.913 --> 42:19.809
So thank you very much,

42:19.809 --> 42:22.625
it was nice to say goodbye to him tonight.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.932
And I look forward to
seeing him again, actually.

42:56.590 --> 42:57.966
â™ª One potato two potato â™ª

42:57.966 --> 43:00.486
(lion roars)
