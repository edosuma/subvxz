Yes, I know, Mr. Endicott
owns the paper

01:29.533 --> 01:31.366
that's‐that's why
I'm calling him.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.800
Yeah, well, well,
I rather not tell you

uh, I work in the basement.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.766
And I just wanted..
Hello? Hello!

01:50.200 --> 01:51.666
That's amazing.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.066
You was dynamic on the phone
as you are in person.

01:56.066 --> 01:59.033
I can't believe it,
I have this great idea

for an investigative
reporting team

02:00.633 --> 02:02.566

with Mr. Endicott

past his secretary.

the invitations

to Mr. Endicott's party.

Oh. Boy, would I love to
go to that party.

Well, cousin,
I'm glad to hear that

03:00.566 --> 03:02.666
because I need the ride.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.033
You got invited to the party?

But you‐you don't even know
the Endicotts.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.066
Oh, cousin,
that's not entirely true.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.533
Last week, while I was
delivering the mail

03:12.566 --> 03:15.766
I meet Mrs. Endicott,
and we had a very nice chat.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.400
Um, I told her I was an heir
to the throne of Mypos and..

03:19.433 --> 03:20.466
[clears throat]

03:22.200 --> 03:23.600
...told a few jokes
and like that

03:23.633 --> 03:25.300
she invited me to the party.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.766
W‐w‐wait a minute!
What did you tell her?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.266
I told her the one
about the rabbi

03:29.300 --> 03:31.200
and the kangaroo, you know..

03:31.233 --> 03:33.266
No, no.
Not, not the joke.

03:35.333 --> 03:38.266
The part about being an heir
to the throne of Mypos

03:38.300 --> 03:40.366
you never told me,
you were an heir to the throne.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.300
‐ I didn't?
‐ No! You didn't.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.133
Well, slap me stupid.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.533
Balki, this‐this is incredible.

03:49.566 --> 03:51.333
Well, what are you,
first in line?

03:51.366 --> 03:52.766
Second? Third?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.766
Nine hundred and eighty‐sixth.

03:59.366 --> 04:02.333
Is everyone on Mypos,
an heir to the throne?

04:02.366 --> 04:06.133
Well, of course, no.
Don't be ridiculous.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.433
Only the men and a few of
the older women with moustaches.

04:14.100 --> 04:17.200
I don't suppose you got around
to telling Mrs. Endicott

04:17.233 --> 04:20.065
that there were 985 heirs
ahead of you.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.400
Cousin, that's common knowledge.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.433
Right.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.266
Right.

04:30.666 --> 04:34.633
So we can go to
the Endicotts for the weekend.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.466
And I'll finally get a chance
to tell Mr. Endicott

04:37.500 --> 04:40.766
my idea for the paper,
and that will kick my career

04:40.800 --> 04:44.566

I got a new sport coat,
a new pair of pants.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.400
When I walk in to that party,
people are going to turn

05:13.433 --> 05:15.500
and say..
What's that smell?

05:20.366 --> 05:22.733
Are you cooking pig snout?

05:24.733 --> 05:26.466
You bet your baby babkas.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.566
Cousin, I've got
thirty gallons of pig snout

05:32.600 --> 05:34.566
that I need to take
to the Endicotts' shindig.

05:37.466 --> 05:40.133
Listen, when it's my turn
to pick the party game

05:40.166 --> 05:42.033
I'm going to suggest
barbing for snout.

05:49.366 --> 05:51.300
It happens to be
a great ice‐breaker.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.766
I'm sure it is.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.100
Balki!

05:58.666 --> 06:02.266
[clears throat]
These people
don't barb for pig parts.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.800
The Endicotts are rich

06:06.833 --> 06:09.466
and the rich
are not like you and me.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.466
Oh, come on, cousin,
they're just like everyone else

06:12.500 --> 06:15.100
they put their pantyhose on,
one leg at a time.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.233
One leg at a time,
you think so?

06:19.266 --> 06:20.500
‐ 'I know so.'
‐ You do?

06:20.533 --> 06:22.166
‐ Yes, I do.
‐ Balki, tell me.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.466
How many rich people
do you know?

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
‐ Ah.
‐ How many?

06:24.533 --> 06:25.600
‐ Ah.
‐ How many?

06:25.633 --> 06:29.533
How many rich people? How many
rich people do you know?

06:29.566 --> 06:31.800
None.

06:31.833 --> 06:35.166
None? As in zero, as in
no rich people do you know?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.300
That is correct.

06:37.333 --> 06:41.200
Well, it just
so happens that I..

06:41.233 --> 06:43.433
...have envied rich people
all my life.

06:45.466 --> 06:48.366
And I am very familiar
with their customs.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.766
When they invite you
into their homes

06:51.800 --> 06:56.033
you have to behave the way
they expect you to behave.

06:56.066 --> 06:59.433
What the Endicotts expect
to see is Prince Balki.

06:59.466 --> 07:02.600
So you have to act
like royalty.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.500
Cousin, I don't know
how do that.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.233
Luckily, I do know
how do that.

07:10.066 --> 07:12.233
I knew you would.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.200
Now. First of all.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.633
Royalty always refer
to themselves

07:18.666 --> 07:20.066
in the first person plural

07:20.100 --> 07:21.433
never in
the first person singular

07:21.466 --> 07:22.600
always in
the first person plural.

07:22.633 --> 07:23.533
So..

07:25.166 --> 07:28.400
...if someone asks you
what you think of the party

07:28.433 --> 07:31.200
you would say..

07:31.233 --> 07:32.300
‐ I think‐‐
‐ Wrong.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.466
‐ You think..
‐ No.

We think.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.133
‐ We do?
‐ That's right.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.166
‐ What's right?
‐ "We" is right.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.333
I know we is,
but what is we right about?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.400
"We" is the correct word.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.333
‐ We is.
‐ Now you've got it.

08:03.366 --> 08:05.500
‐ I do.
‐ We do.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.366
We do? We do what?
What are we talking about?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.766
I don't know
what we're talking about.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.100

I was cooking up some snout!

Balki, Balki, Balki,
Shh, shh, shh.

08:18.466 --> 08:21.033
Let me make this
very simple for you.

08:21.066 --> 08:23.800
Just use the word, "we"

08:23.833 --> 08:26.466
instead of the word, "I."

08:27.800 --> 08:31.166
Wait a minute, you mean,
I simply substitute

08:31.200 --> 08:34.033
the plural person of pronoun
for the singular in all cases?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.000
Why you didn't say so?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.200

08:47.066 --> 08:49.533
Okay, let's try it.

08:49.566 --> 08:52.133

and someone says to you

"Oh, welcome,
Prince Bartokomous

08:54.133 --> 08:56.333

"We are very happy to be here.

"And we would appreciate it

would give us a hand

13:40.800 --> 13:43.500
We could play a little golf.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.666
We love little golf.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.100
We're especially good
at the windmill hole.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.200
[laughing]
Prince! Stop!

13:52.233 --> 13:54.133
Tell me, Your Highness.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.333
What do you think
of American women?

13:57.366 --> 14:01.133
Well, we think they spend
a little too much time

14:01.166 --> 14:03.300
trying to remove
excess facial hair.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.766
A trap we're glad to say
you didn't fall into.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.033
[laughing]

14:18.233 --> 14:20.500
You know it's a pity
the Mypiot humor

14:20.533 --> 14:23.433
doesn't translate into English.

14:23.466 --> 14:25.100
Or any other language.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.400
Your Highness,
I‐I've been wondering.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.066
Why in the world would
a prince be working

14:32.100 --> 14:34.333
in the mail room
of my husband's newspaper?

14:34.366 --> 14:35.233
Well‐‐

14:35.266 --> 14:38.066
Could I field this one
for you, prince?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.500
Oh, well..

14:39.533 --> 14:41.800
Uh, His Highness doesn't want
anyone at The Chronicle

14:41.833 --> 14:44.066
to know he's heir to the throne.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.266
He came to this country
to find a wife

14:47.300 --> 14:50.266
but he wants her to
love him for himself.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.300
(Larry)
'Not for his wealth
and power and place in history.'

14:54.666 --> 14:57.666
That sounds like
that Eddie Mumphry movie

14:57.700 --> 14:59.433
"Coming To America."

15:01.066 --> 15:04.000
Would you, um, excuse us?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.266
And them.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.633
Cousin, are you aware that
you just told a big, fat lie?

15:17.566 --> 15:19.300
I'm‐I'm sorry, Balki.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.666
I guess I'm just so frustrated
at not being able to get to

15:21.700 --> 15:24.366
Mr. Endicott that I‐I forgot

15:24.400 --> 15:26.133
that lying was a bad thing.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.166
If the lying doesn't stop,
I'm outta here!

15:32.200 --> 15:34.233
Okay! It's alright,
I'm better now.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.600
‐ You are?
‐ Yes, I am.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.733
‐ No more lying?
‐ No more lying.

15:37.766 --> 15:40.166
Attention, attention.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.066
We need two more for polo.
Does anyone play?

15:43.100 --> 15:44.333
We do.

15:46.233 --> 15:47.766
[instrumental music]

16:14.800 --> 16:17.533
I didn't know
polo would be so hard.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.533
Cousin, think about it.

16:26.233 --> 16:30.066
Hitting a tiny ball
with a stick..

16:30.100 --> 16:33.533
...while riding
a galloping horse at full speed

16:33.566 --> 16:36.033
is not a skill you can fake.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.000
I thought
the horse would do more.

16:45.366 --> 16:47.266
[sighs]

16:47.300 --> 16:49.333
Alright, cousin.

16:49.366 --> 16:51.433
The time has come for me to tell

16:51.466 --> 16:53.466
Muffy and Bobo the truth.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.566
If you tell the Endicotts
you are not a Prince

16:58.600 --> 17:01.100
they will throw us out
and I will never get a chance

17:01.133 --> 17:02.500
to talk to Mr. Endicott.

17:02.533 --> 17:05.700
Nevertheless.
The truth must be served.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.500
Can't you serve it later?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.599
No. It's getting cold.

17:17.665 --> 17:19.733
You realize I'll have to go now?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.700
Yes. I know.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.233
You know I'll have to stop you.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.233
Yes. I know.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.033
[grunting]

17:40.100 --> 17:42.600
No. No. No.

17:42.633 --> 17:44.733
Not the nose!
Not the nose!

17:46.666 --> 17:48.400
It's the pride of Mypos.

17:48.433 --> 17:49.400
‐ Oh.
‐ Ah.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.133
[grunting]

17:54.733 --> 17:56.666
[shattering]

18:09.333 --> 18:10.400
(both)
Hi.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.300
Uh, Bobo, I‐I..

18:19.166 --> 18:21.366
Mister.
Mr. Endicott.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.333
Bobo.

18:23.366 --> 18:25.366
I‐I‐I'm so glad I ran into you.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.766
I'd like to tell you about
a terrific idea

18:26.800 --> 18:28.166
I had for the paper.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.266
We set up an investigative
reporting unit

18:30.300 --> 18:32.166
you know, along the lines
of Woodward and Bernstein.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.033
I'd be happy
to head up the team.

18:34.066 --> 18:36.400
Statistics show that papers
who have these teams

18:36.433 --> 18:38.800
win more Pulitzers
and increase their circulation

18:38.833 --> 18:41.066
on an average of 4.63 percent.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.333
I think it's just the thing
The Chronicle needs.

18:43.366 --> 18:45.366
A bad idea.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.233
I had an investigative reporting
team on the last paper I owned.

18:49.266 --> 18:51.400
They got me sued
for 38 million dollars.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.466
Hmm?

18:54.066 --> 18:56.333
‐ What was your name again?
‐ McGregor.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.633
Joe McGregor.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.766
[Balki mumbling]

19:10.533 --> 19:11.600
That's better.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.333
Buffy, Momo.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.200
I'm sorry about the mess.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.633
Oh, please.
Don't concern yourself.

19:25.666 --> 19:29.566
It's nothing.
A Persian rug.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.333
A gift from the Aga Khan.

19:33.366 --> 19:35.133
A small price to pay

19:35.166 --> 19:37.766
for the honor of
Your Highness' company.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.533
Well, we gotta talk about that.

19:39.566 --> 19:42.733
Do we really?
Do we really?

19:42.766 --> 19:45.033
I mean, I've said everything
I have to say, and‐and‐‐

19:45.066 --> 19:46.466
Let it go, Joe.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.066
Uh..

19:53.266 --> 19:56.400
I'm not the kind of royalty
you think I am.

19:56.433 --> 19:59.166
I am an heir
to the throne of Mypos but..

20:00.500 --> 20:03.366
...so are all
the other men on Mypos

20:03.400 --> 20:06.466
and a few of the older women
with moustaches.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.733
Oh, dear, look at the time.

20:13.766 --> 20:15.766
Why don't we all
go in to dinner?

20:17.566 --> 20:19.300
[indistinct murmuring]

20:20.433 --> 20:22.166
Well, you see, cousin?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.500
I‐I told the Endicott's
the truth about myself

20:24.533 --> 20:26.600
and‐and they didn't
throw us out.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.033
Uh..

20:35.066 --> 20:36.633
‐ Bobo?
‐ Balki.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.300
‐ Muffy?
‐ Balki.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.766
Muff! It‐it's Balki.

20:40.800 --> 20:44.400
[chuckles]
You‐you‐you
accidentally locked us out.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.666
It was no accident, Balki.
They meant to lock us out.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.766
Cousin..

20:51.633 --> 20:54.233
You mean that‐that the Endicotts

20:54.266 --> 20:57.400
pretended to be my friends
but they were not?

20:58.666 --> 21:01.566
I'm sorry we ever came.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.433
Forget about
the Endicotts, Balki.

21:04.466 --> 21:06.066
If they don't want
you as a friend.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.733
Well, they're the ones
who are missing out.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.433
You‐you have more class
in your little finger

21:10.466 --> 21:12.366
than all of them put together.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.300
[sighs]

21:14.333 --> 21:16.333
Thank you, cousin.

21:16.366 --> 21:18.633
All rich people
are snobs anyway.

21:18.666 --> 21:21.100
Horse apples!

21:21.133 --> 21:23.533
Not all rich people are snobs,
just those jerks.

21:23.566 --> 21:24.766
And what do they know?

21:24.800 --> 21:28.069
They never worked
a day in their lives.

21:28.102 --> 21:30.769
Wow! Imagine what
they'd have if they worked?

21:34.502 --> 21:35.902
I've been watching you
all evening.

21:35.936 --> 21:37.636
You seem like a nice kid.

21:37.669 --> 21:40.469
But 86, the royalty act.

21:40.502 --> 21:42.802
And you, I like the idea
you had for the paper.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.569
Well, I appreciate that, but..

21:46.602 --> 21:48.802
Bobo, the clown hates it.

21:48.836 --> 21:50.136
What does it matter
what we think?

21:50.169 --> 21:51.836
Oh, it doesn't matter
what you think.

21:51.869 --> 21:54.869
It matters what I think.
I'm Bobo Sr.

21:57.936 --> 22:00.836
You're Bobo‐Bobo‐Bobo?

22:00.869 --> 22:02.702
You're Bobo‐Bobo‐Bobo..

22:02.736 --> 22:04.436
Bobo‐Bobo‐Bobo..

22:04.469 --> 22:07.369
Cousin, this really is no time

22:07.402 --> 22:08.936
for your Bing Crosby imitation.

22:12.636 --> 22:15.869
I still own controlling
interest in the paper.

22:15.902 --> 22:19.569
And I think that your idea about
the investigative reporting team

22:19.602 --> 22:21.969
isn't half bad.

22:22.002 --> 22:24.069
You like it?
Did you hear that, Balki?

22:24.102 --> 22:26.802
He likes it!
You mean I can head up the team?

22:26.836 --> 22:28.436
No, that's the half
that was bad.

22:29.969 --> 22:32.736
We need somebody
that's more experienced.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.902
'But don't worry, you'll get
your chance to be on the team.'

22:35.936 --> 22:39.569
I never forget
a name, Joe McGregor.

22:41.569 --> 22:42.669
Uh‐ah, Appleton.

22:42.702 --> 22:45.802
Uh, my name is
actually Larry Appleton.

22:45.836 --> 22:48.569
Joe McGregor is just a nickname.

22:48.602 --> 22:49.802
It's a stupid nickname.

22:51.602 --> 22:53.969
Almost as stupid as Bobo.

22:54.002 --> 22:55.869
Skippy! Now, that's a nickname!

22:58.536 --> 23:00.669
Open up! It's Big Bobo!

23:06.102 --> 23:08.569
Well, there you go, cousin.

23:08.602 --> 23:10.602
All rich people are not snobs.

23:10.636 --> 23:12.969
Big Bobo was very nice to us.

23:13.002 --> 23:14.769
He didn't invite us
in to dinner.

23:14.802 --> 23:16.936
Well, don't you
worry about that.

23:16.969 --> 23:19.369
I've got 30 gallons
of pig snout at home

23:19.402 --> 23:21.069
with your name on it.

23:21.102 --> 23:22.836
[instrumental music]

23:30.802 --> 23:31.936
[theme music]
