  Come on, get 'em... get 'em!

01:21.781 --> 01:24.182
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

01:24.249 --> 01:25.183
Hey, hey, hey.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.618
What happened
                to "Ho, ho, ho"?

01:26.686 --> 01:28.486
Christmas ain't what
it used to be, Alex.

01:28.554 --> 01:30.488
It's the worst bowl game
I've ever seen.

01:30.556 --> 01:31.956
Both teams stink.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.693
This ain't a bowl game;
it's a tapestry.

01:35.795 --> 01:36.827
Tapestry?

01:36.895 --> 01:38.462
Yeah, you know, a tapestry.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.432
It's ridiculous. It's a joke.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.633
It's not a tapestry;
        it's a travesty.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.036
Well, I admit there was

01:45.104 --> 01:46.704
some good action
     in the first quarter.

01:46.772 --> 01:48.539
(knock at door)

01:48.607 --> 01:49.974
You expecting somebody?

01:50.042 --> 01:51.876
No.
               The Easter Bunny?

01:51.944 --> 01:53.744
Baby New Year?

01:53.812 --> 01:54.913
The Great Pumpkin?

01:54.981 --> 01:56.114
Ho, ho, ho.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.849
(laughing)

01:58.917 --> 02:00.519
Phyllis.

02:00.586 --> 02:01.652
Hi, Alex.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.753
Hi.

02:02.821 --> 02:04.089
Oh, excuse me.

02:04.156 --> 02:07.025
You know, I once had
  a maternity suit like that.

02:07.092 --> 02:09.259
Oh, no, no, I'm dressed
           like this 'cause, uh,

02:09.328 --> 02:10.895
I'm going down
to the youth center

02:10.963 --> 02:13.231
to give out presents
to the juvenile delinquents.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.231
Really?
Yeah.

02:14.299 --> 02:16.200
Oh, what a
                 wonderful idea.

02:16.268 --> 02:19.337
Certainly a novel way
        to escape the loneliness

02:19.405 --> 02:21.939
and depression that
            haunts so many of us

02:22.007 --> 02:23.708
on Christmas Eve.

02:23.775 --> 02:25.376
Oh, yeah. Phyllis.

02:25.444 --> 02:26.578
Your ex-wife.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.846
Well, I got to go.

02:27.913 --> 02:29.647
They're expecting me
down at the center.

02:29.715 --> 02:31.482
If I'm late
with the presents,

02:31.550 --> 02:33.585
they'll start opening up
each other.

02:33.652 --> 02:34.986
Merry Christmas.

02:35.053 --> 02:36.187
Merry Christmas.
Bye-bye.

02:36.254 --> 02:37.756
Tony.
  Bye.
              Bye.

02:39.725 --> 02:41.559
Well, Phyllis,

02:41.627 --> 02:43.128
what brings you here
       on Christmas Eve?

02:43.195 --> 02:44.161
Alex,

02:44.229 --> 02:46.431
a crazy thing happened,

02:46.499 --> 02:49.133
and I think it may have been
      God speaking to me.

02:49.201 --> 02:52.437
At 3:15 this afternoon,
                    it struck me

02:52.505 --> 02:54.472
that I really
              wanted to see you.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.608
At that same moment,
I knew

02:57.676 --> 03:00.644
that you were thinking
that you wanted to see me.

03:00.712 --> 03:02.313
Now, was I right, Alex?

03:02.380 --> 03:03.548
Is there a God?

03:04.817 --> 03:06.751
Well, I think a lot of things
         all the time.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.119
I mean, uh,
     it's possible I might

03:08.187 --> 03:09.254
have been thinking
       about you, but...

03:09.321 --> 03:10.488
Really?

03:10.556 --> 03:12.457
Oh, I thought I was making
      the whole thing up.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.025
Phyllis,

03:14.092 --> 03:15.426
what are you
                     doing here?

03:15.494 --> 03:17.862
Get me through
the holidays, Alex.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.464
Please.
                    Oh, Phyllis!

03:19.531 --> 03:20.898
That's right.

03:20.966 --> 03:22.766
"Oh, Phyllis."

03:22.834 --> 03:25.803
Alex, you know
   I don't have any friends,

03:25.871 --> 03:27.872
our daughter is
             out of the country,

03:27.940 --> 03:31.342
and my other ex-husband
      recently won a court order

03:31.410 --> 03:34.746
that forbids me to get
        within 400 yards of him.

03:34.813 --> 03:35.913
Oh, no.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.184
Please, Alex, please.

03:39.251 --> 03:40.919
I just don't want
this Christmas

03:40.986 --> 03:42.654
to be like
last Christmas.

03:42.721 --> 03:44.122
Anything but that.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.424
I just can't go
through that again.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.193
Not that.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.627
Phyllis, I'm not
                going to ask you

03:49.695 --> 03:50.662
what happened
                 last Christmas.

03:50.729 --> 03:51.663
You're not?

03:51.730 --> 03:53.498
I swear to
                    God I'm not.

03:53.565 --> 03:55.767
Well, good, because I'm not
      about to tear open a wound

03:55.835 --> 03:57.636
that healed
                  after a year.
               Good.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.203
Okay, good.

04:01.107 --> 04:04.709
Alex, I'm really not
asking for much.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.411
You know, we could make
a little eggnog.

04:06.478 --> 04:07.411
Oh, no, please.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.513
We could start a fire.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.881
Phyllis, please.
We'll roast a goose.

04:09.948 --> 04:10.915
No.

04:10.983 --> 04:12.584
Alex, we can invite
your friends over.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.919
We can have a
little party.
                 I don't want to
            invite my friends...

04:14.987 --> 04:17.154
I think I could scrape up
a band at the last minute.

04:17.221 --> 04:20.224
No, I really...
        I really don't think so.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.560
Look, Phyllis, I-I'd really like
          to help you,

04:22.627 --> 04:24.161
but I-I got to go to work.

04:24.229 --> 04:26.397
In fact, I got to go leave
           right now.

04:26.465 --> 04:27.932
You're working?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.334
Christmas Eve?

04:29.402 --> 04:30.501
Yeah, that's right.

04:32.104 --> 04:34.105
Oh, God, how pathetic.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.373
Oh, don't feel sorry
for me.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.241
No, I'm talking
                       about me.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.445
I mean, you've
                    got it made.

04:40.513 --> 04:44.315
Good tips, not much traffic,
      interesting people.

04:44.383 --> 04:46.184
Can I come along with you?

04:46.251 --> 04:47.952
No.

04:48.019 --> 04:49.254
Alex, I won't
              bother your fares.

04:49.321 --> 04:50.387
I'll lie on
                      the floor.

04:50.455 --> 04:51.723
They won't even
                 know I'm there.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.057
No!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.191
In the trunk, then.

04:54.259 --> 04:56.060
Just leave it open a
         crack so I can breathe.

04:56.128 --> 04:57.128
Phyllis!

04:57.196 --> 04:58.429
Please, Alex.

04:58.497 --> 04:59.764
Okay, but just a crack.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.231
No, what am I talking about?

05:01.299 --> 05:02.667
You can't come with me.

05:02.735 --> 05:03.801
I'm sorry.

05:03.869 --> 05:05.569
Alex, don't kick me out!

05:07.473 --> 05:10.275
Let me at least stay here
         until midnight

05:10.342 --> 05:14.278
so my doorman will think
  that I had someplace to go.

05:14.346 --> 05:16.280
Give me that, Alex.

05:16.348 --> 05:19.417
Let me impress my doorman.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.254
Okay, you can stay here.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.889
(sighs)
(stammering)

05:24.957 --> 05:26.290
There's some
leftover Jiffy Pop.

05:26.358 --> 05:28.159
And, uh, there's a...
there's a rerun

05:28.227 --> 05:29.827
of <i>Frosty the Snowman</i>
on television.

05:29.895 --> 05:32.063
You're a saint, Alex.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.965
I-I know.
                      Thank you.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.668
(loudly):
      Thank you... saint.

05:46.411 --> 05:48.112
(humming)

05:48.180 --> 05:49.813
Jeff.

05:49.881 --> 05:53.851
I know you got your family
at home waiting for you.

05:53.919 --> 05:55.686
It's Christmas Eve.
What the hell?

05:55.754 --> 05:57.321
I'm going to let you
go home early.

05:57.389 --> 05:58.556
Go on.
Get out of here.

05:58.624 --> 05:59.991
Merry Christmas.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.260
Louie, I get off
in six minutes.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.964
Well, go, enjoy them.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.802
Merry Christmas, Jim.

06:10.869 --> 06:12.136
Merry Christmas, Alex.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.304
(mumbling)

06:13.372 --> 06:14.672
(crying)

06:14.740 --> 06:15.839
Merry Christmas,
Elaine.

06:15.907 --> 06:17.408
Merry Christmas.

06:17.475 --> 06:18.576
(sobbing)

06:18.644 --> 06:20.445
Aw.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.484
Drop the kids off
    at the airport, did you?

06:26.552 --> 06:27.518
(sobbing):
              Yes.

06:27.586 --> 06:28.553
Aw.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.587
Why, Alex, why?

06:30.655 --> 06:33.090
This is the second year in a row
      I've let them choose

06:33.158 --> 06:36.093
where to spend Christmas
 and they picked their father.

06:36.161 --> 06:39.197
Now I'm wondering if they
love him more than they love me.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.867
Why? Why, Alex?

06:42.935 --> 06:46.637
Well, doesn't he have that
great, uh, ski chalet in Aspen?

06:46.705 --> 06:50.141
No, I mean,
   why do I let them choose?

06:50.209 --> 06:51.208
Listen,
I'll get you coffee.

06:51.276 --> 06:52.210
You all right?
              Yes.

06:52.277 --> 06:53.210
Cheer up.

I loved it.

than spreading a little joy
         to my friends?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.171
ALEX:
Yeah.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.406
Right, Alex?

07:55.474 --> 07:57.241
Hey, now, wait a second.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.509
Now, wait a minute.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.010
I hope that little wink
          doesn't mean

08:00.078 --> 08:01.879
you're going to do something
       like that for me.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.480
Why?
Why?

08:03.548 --> 08:04.749
Because I would feel
very embarrassed

08:04.817 --> 08:06.951
at everybody staring at me
while some Phillip Morris boy

08:07.019 --> 08:09.486
came in here and tap-danced
and sang at me.

08:09.554 --> 08:12.490
You've got nothing
           to worry about, Alex.

08:12.558 --> 08:15.893
I would never send a
              Phillip Morris boy

08:15.961 --> 08:17.128
for a guy like you.

08:17.195 --> 08:18.196

Merry Christmas.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.676
You don't have
to say anything, Alex.

09:05.744 --> 09:08.846
The look in your eyes
is thanks enough.

09:08.913 --> 09:12.116
Okay, drivers, listen up here.

09:12.183 --> 09:14.618
On behalf of myself

09:14.686 --> 09:19.257
and the Sunshine Cab Company,
     on this Christmas Eve,

09:19.324 --> 09:21.925
I just want to say...

09:21.993 --> 09:24.862
watch out for drunk drivers

09:24.930 --> 09:29.834
and don't pick up anybody
  who might puke in your cab.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.769
Noel, Noel, joy to the world.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.972
And get your butts out of here.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.507
Donald, 218.

09:36.574 --> 09:39.710
Uh, Q.K., cab 387.

09:46.551 --> 09:48.686
Hi!

09:48.754 --> 09:49.987
Latka told me that you

09:50.055 --> 09:51.889
are making the cabbies
         work tonight,

09:51.957 --> 09:54.158
and I think that's terrible.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.461
I didn't say they had to work.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.896
I just said,
      if they didn't work,

09:58.964 --> 10:01.933
they might not get cabs
       with the luxuries

10:02.001 --> 10:04.401
that they've grown
        accustomed to...

10:04.469 --> 10:06.537
like reverse.

10:09.508 --> 10:13.677
Well, Latka and I are having
 a party tonight, Mr. Scrooge,

10:13.745 --> 10:15.512
and I want to
                get on the radio

10:15.580 --> 10:17.881
and invite all
                    our friends.

10:17.949 --> 10:19.249
(grunts)

10:19.317 --> 10:21.019
Well, what would it take for you

10:21.086 --> 10:23.254
to... to let us invite
        all our friends?

10:23.321 --> 10:25.356
$500.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.490
Okay.

10:26.557 --> 10:28.692
Will you take a check?

10:28.760 --> 10:31.062
But, Simka,
     how are we going to--

10:31.129 --> 10:33.397
Shut up, my darling!
           (smooches)

10:34.566 --> 10:35.733
SIMKA:
                          There.

10:38.570 --> 10:41.672
I don't think I'll be able
        to cash a check

10:41.739 --> 10:44.575
made out to
   "The Bloodsucking Jackal."

10:46.679 --> 10:47.811
Really?

10:47.879 --> 10:48.879
Why?

10:48.947 --> 10:50.214
Who would question it?

10:52.150 --> 10:54.952
Simka, I do work for this man.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.822
And I didn't hear
       my name mentioned

10:57.890 --> 11:00.324
in regard to the party, either.

11:00.391 --> 11:01.526
Louie...

11:01.593 --> 11:06.130
Louie, you poor, pathetic thing.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.065
You only wanted money

11:08.133 --> 11:11.468
because you thought you
    weren't going to be invited.

11:11.536 --> 11:13.737
Oh, Louie.

11:13.805 --> 11:16.940
Oh, Louie,
                   Louie, Louie.

11:17.008 --> 11:20.011
Poor Louie.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.913
Does this mean
I'm invited?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.981
If we have to.

11:25.450 --> 11:26.717
I accept.

11:26.785 --> 11:27.951
Yes!
I'll go spruce up.

11:28.019 --> 11:29.086
You can use the radio.

11:29.154 --> 11:30.988
Thank you, boss!

11:35.927 --> 11:38.195
Reiger, Reiger.

11:38.263 --> 11:40.364
Come in, Reiger.

11:40.432 --> 11:41.932
(over radio):
      Yeah, this is Alex.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.200
Go ahead.

11:43.268 --> 11:45.970
Uh, Louie said you don't
           have to work tonight,

11:46.038 --> 11:49.507
so come on over and spend
          Christmas Eve tonight.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.943
I-I have to go now.

11:52.010 --> 11:55.313
Uh, that's a big ten-four,
          good buddy.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.181
Now, Simka, Simka,

11:57.249 --> 11:59.816
I'm afraid I'm going
       to have to say no,

11:59.884 --> 12:02.153
but, uh, thank you anyway.

12:03.254 --> 12:05.389
Should I bring something
         to the party?

12:05.456 --> 12:07.391
Oh, uh,

12:07.459 --> 12:09.760
Simka has made everything
            we need.

12:09.828 --> 12:12.230
Do you like Christmas ham

12:12.297 --> 12:15.166
with, uh, honey glaze
     and pineapples on it?

12:15.233 --> 12:16.299
Yeah.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.302
Good.
   Then you better bring one.

12:21.506 --> 12:23.207
Hi, Phyllis.
I was just dropping by.

12:23.275 --> 12:26.110
I thought I'd just stop in
and see how you were doing.

12:26.177 --> 12:27.511
Did you eat all that?

12:27.578 --> 12:28.980
Mm.

12:29.047 --> 12:32.683
Alex, I just want to thank you

12:32.751 --> 12:34.685
for not kicking me out.

12:34.752 --> 12:38.655
This Christmas is so much better

12:38.723 --> 12:40.657
than last year.

12:42.226 --> 12:43.795
You really did
                  eat all that?!

12:43.862 --> 12:47.298
You know, I eat
when I'm depressed.

12:48.399 --> 12:50.968
I ate everything
      in the refrigerator.

12:52.437 --> 12:53.737
Well, anyway, I just, uh,

12:53.805 --> 12:56.407
just want to see
      how you were doing.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.042
Did you know

12:58.110 --> 13:01.311
that Frosty the Snowman melted
          in the end?

13:02.613 --> 13:03.914
Phyllis, I'm missing fares.

13:03.982 --> 13:05.182
I have to go.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.483
I'll, uh...

13:06.551 --> 13:10.054
Alex, you know, sometimes,
             when you look back,

13:10.122 --> 13:12.189
things seem much better

13:12.256 --> 13:14.892
than they actually
             were, you know, but

13:14.960 --> 13:17.061
I remember

13:17.129 --> 13:20.898
we used to have some
wonderful Christmases together.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.232
Yeah, you're right.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.401
When you look back,
     things do seem better.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.770
No, no, no, no,
hey, no, no.

13:26.838 --> 13:29.273
I mean, we had some wonderful
Christmases, we really did.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.909
Look, I'll, um....

13:31.977 --> 13:33.577
I'll check in
      on you later, okay?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.915
Can I get you anything?

13:37.983 --> 13:41.618
A gallon of Rocky Road
         and cable TV.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.522
(laughs)

13:44.589 --> 13:45.689
(laughs)

13:45.757 --> 13:46.924
(laughs)

13:46.992 --> 13:48.225
(laughs)

13:48.293 --> 13:50.327
(both laughing)

13:51.396 --> 13:53.497
Oh.

13:53.565 --> 13:54.898
Rocky Road

13:54.966 --> 13:56.767
and cable TV.

14:00.872 --> 14:02.806
You want to go to a party?

14:02.874 --> 14:05.942
Did you invite me to a party?

14:06.010 --> 14:09.813
Or did I just have
      a hypoglycemic rush?

14:09.881 --> 14:12.416
No... come on.
                  I'll take you.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.485
Really?
             Yeah, come on.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.797
Watching you

14:26.865 --> 14:28.999
brings back old memories.

14:31.603 --> 14:34.105
Every Christmas

14:34.172 --> 14:37.909
my family would get a-a big,

14:37.976 --> 14:41.645
beautiful, Scotch pine tree.

14:41.713 --> 14:43.647
We'd gather around

14:43.714 --> 14:46.083
and watch the servants
          decorate it.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.793
May I, for old times' sake?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.795
Yeah, go ahead, Jim.

14:58.963 --> 15:01.198
Not there, you fool!

15:04.303 --> 15:06.236
Higher and to the left!

15:09.207 --> 15:12.409
Boy, this is one
of the best Christmases

15:12.477 --> 15:14.411
I've ever had.

15:14.479 --> 15:16.413
Oh, the best!

15:16.481 --> 15:18.616
(knocking on door)

15:22.687 --> 15:24.288
Hi. Merry Christmas,
everybody!

15:24.356 --> 15:25.556
Elaine!
    (shrieks)

15:25.624 --> 15:27.558
Look what my last fare
gave me!
                    What?

15:27.625 --> 15:28.725
A manicure.

15:28.793 --> 15:30.094
No, no, no, no.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.428
This...
                            JIM:
                            Huh?

15:31.496 --> 15:32.863
This gift. See?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.832
Well, I picked this guy
            up from the airport,

15:34.899 --> 15:37.001
and he's coming back early
    from a business trip, right?

15:37.068 --> 15:39.070
So he's telling me
how great his wife is,

15:39.137 --> 15:40.471
what a precious
                   jewel she is,

15:40.538 --> 15:43.007
and how no present in the
  world is worthy of her, right?

15:43.075 --> 15:45.976
So we get to their house,
and she's out in the front

15:46.044 --> 15:47.143
kissing some other guy.

15:47.211 --> 15:48.479
SIMKA:
                            Wow!

15:48.547 --> 15:50.581
So the guy leaves the cab,
      and I say, "Wait a minute.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.849
You forgot your gift," and he
 says, "No, no, no, you keep it.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.118
You deserve it more
                 than she does."

15:54.186 --> 15:56.020
Well, open it!
ELAINE:
I know.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.688
I wanted to wait.
I wonder
what it is.

15:57.756 --> 15:58.956
I'll bet it's a watch.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.359
No, no, not a watch,
             but jewelry, I bet.

16:02.427 --> 16:04.361
A pair of panties.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.967
They say,
  "Property of Hell's Angels."

16:11.435 --> 16:12.936
Big spender.

16:13.004 --> 16:14.004
A four-dollar item.

16:14.072 --> 16:16.674
Six-fifty.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.942
(knocking on door)
                      Oh, well.
                Merry Christmas.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.543
SIMKA:
                Merry Christmas.

16:20.611 --> 16:22.113
Oh.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.314
Alex!

16:23.381 --> 16:25.149
Oh, we're so glad
        you could come.

16:25.216 --> 16:26.383
Oh, hello, everybody.

16:26.451 --> 16:27.951
You all remember
             my ex-wife Phyllis?

16:28.019 --> 16:30.320
Alex, do you have
to call me your ex-wife?

16:30.388 --> 16:31.489
Oh, excuse me.

16:31.556 --> 16:33.490
You remember Phyllis,
                  my podiatrist?

16:36.928 --> 16:39.997
Welcome
to the party.

16:40.064 --> 16:42.700
Oh, thank you very much.

16:42.768 --> 16:46.503
Holidays are a time for
        family, friends and joy.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.340
And since I have none of those,
      I'm glad to be here.

16:49.407 --> 16:51.041
Phyllis, Phyllis,
                      Phyllis...

16:51.109 --> 16:55.245
I see the life of the
              party has arrived.

16:55.313 --> 16:58.215
I got a great idea.

16:58.282 --> 16:59.482
What?

16:59.550 --> 17:01.852
Why don't we all tell
what we did last Christmas?

17:01.920 --> 17:03.020
ELAINE:
                            Ooh.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.555
Last Christmas?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.656
Oh, no, that's a bad idea.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.025
That's a terrible idea.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.425
Just awful.
No, it'll be fun.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.194
SIMKA:
                           Yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.230
Who would like
        to go first?
                        PHYLLIS:
                 No, no, no, no.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.633
Last Christmas...

17:16.701 --> 17:19.868
I was alone again,

17:19.936 --> 17:22.105
so I decided,

17:22.173 --> 17:24.141
uh, to go to a restaurant

17:24.208 --> 17:26.577
where at least
  I would be with some people.

17:26.645 --> 17:29.546
So, um, sure enough...

17:29.614 --> 17:31.982
I mean,
 there must have been 50 people

17:32.050 --> 17:34.151
at this restaurant--

17:34.219 --> 17:36.387
a party of 49 and me.

17:38.456 --> 17:42.926
Not one of those 49 people
     asked me to join them.

17:42.994 --> 17:44.127
Yeah.

17:44.195 --> 17:45.762
Phyllis...
                      So I left.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.398
I left, and I started
                   walking home.

17:48.466 --> 17:51.835
And I kept bumping into
         all sorts of happiness.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.605
I mean, people
                with loved ones,

17:54.672 --> 17:58.575
just bustling to buy their
    Christmas last-minute gifts.

17:58.643 --> 18:01.478
And music
and laughter coming from

18:01.546 --> 18:04.214
parties I wasn't
                even invited to.

18:04.282 --> 18:07.618
And suddenly,
                 I was struck...

18:07.685 --> 18:10.420
By a bus, I hope.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.126
No such luck, cutie.

18:16.194 --> 18:18.195
I was struck

18:18.263 --> 18:22.432
by a deeply
depressing revelation.

18:22.500 --> 18:27.471
I am a lonely,
middle-aged woman

18:27.538 --> 18:31.074
unable to deal
with Christmas.

18:31.142 --> 18:33.644
(quiet moan)

18:40.117 --> 18:42.419
Who invited
   Alex's podiatrist?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.189
(Alex speaks quietly,
         indistinctly)

18:45.257 --> 18:47.758
(knocking on door)

18:47.825 --> 18:48.993
I...

18:49.060 --> 18:50.728
Merry Christmas,
everybody.
             (all talking)

18:50.795 --> 18:52.229
Hey, listen, I hope
you don't mind, Simka,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.265
but I brought some of the kids
from the youth center.

18:54.332 --> 18:55.432
No, the more the merrier.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.599
Come on.
                          LOUIE:
                            Hey.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.036
TONY:
All right, all right,
listen, everybody,

18:59.103 --> 19:01.839
this is Philly Fingers, Big Al
and Joey Mook over here.

19:01.906 --> 19:03.173
Hello.
                           ALEX:
                             Hi.

19:03.241 --> 19:05.175
Now, you guys steal anything,
I break your heads.

19:05.243 --> 19:06.410
Say Merry Christmas.

19:06.477 --> 19:08.211
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:08.279 --> 19:10.080
I said say
    Merry Christmas. Say it!

19:10.147 --> 19:11.615
And God bless you. Say it!

19:11.682 --> 19:12.783
BOYS (mumbling):
        Merry Christmas.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.218
All right, get over there
         and sit down.

19:14.285 --> 19:16.286
Latka, hide the silver.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.727
In our country is tradition
      that, at this time,

19:23.795 --> 19:27.030
someone says the traditional
       Christmas prayer.

19:27.098 --> 19:30.600
Oh, yeah, and in our country,
it is a tradition

19:30.668 --> 19:33.304
that the oldest woman
leads it.

19:33.371 --> 19:34.805
Oh, no.

19:34.872 --> 19:37.208
Oh, great; just great.

19:37.275 --> 19:38.876
When were you born?

19:38.944 --> 19:42.846
Uh, February, 1952.

19:42.913 --> 19:44.515
February what?

19:44.583 --> 19:46.850
Fourth.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.085
Dear Lord...

19:48.153 --> 19:49.720
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.588
Oh, we all have
to get ready.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.223
Kneel for the prayer.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.591
I said kneel
        for the prayer.

19:54.659 --> 19:57.327
Kneel. Come on, Al,
kneel, I said.

19:57.395 --> 19:59.763
Good boys.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.432
Okay, is everybody ready?

20:01.499 --> 20:03.700
Yeah, let the good times roll.

20:06.237 --> 20:09.572
Dear Lord, no offense,

20:09.640 --> 20:11.575
but, uh,

20:11.642 --> 20:13.644
could you spend less time

20:13.711 --> 20:15.913
with the people
             that don't need it?

20:15.980 --> 20:19.850
I mean, like the women
            from the Ice Capades

20:19.918 --> 20:22.185
and ballplayers.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.220
I mean, Lord,
                what do you care

20:24.288 --> 20:26.757
if a guy's stranded
                 on second base?

20:26.824 --> 20:28.692
You got better
things to do.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.995
Phyllis,
you're nudging God.

20:32.063 --> 20:37.233
Also, for me, Lord,
               stop short skirts

20:37.301 --> 20:39.803
and bring back
                     two refills

20:39.871 --> 20:42.573
per prescription
                      on Valium.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.607
Oh.

20:44.675 --> 20:47.010
And peace on earth

20:47.078 --> 20:49.780
and goodwill
          toward men.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.881
Nice of you
to throw that in, Phyllis.

20:53.985 --> 20:56.219
Yeah, great prayer, Phyllis.

20:56.287 --> 20:59.556
If I could die now,
I'd be a happy man.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.392
Oh, really, uh,
     I shouldn't have come here.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.495
I mean, I feel like I-I
   ruined everybody's Christmas.

21:04.562 --> 21:06.563
No, no, no, no, no.
                         ELAINE:
                             No.
       (knocking at door)

21:06.630 --> 21:08.165
No, that-that's all right.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.332
SIMKA:
Okay.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.835
You can be as depressing
          as you want.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.471
It won't hurt,
    because I've got money.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.107
ALEX:
              Well, what's money
              got to do with it?

21:18.175 --> 21:19.209
(chuckles)

21:19.277 --> 21:21.278
This.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.414
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
      jingle all the way ¶

21:24.482 --> 21:28.819
(all continue singing,
         indistinctly)

21:28.887 --> 21:30.421
JIM: I didn't know
what to pick,

21:30.488 --> 21:33.657
so I told 'em
to send everything.

21:41.499 --> 21:44.668
Alex, about New Year's Eve.

21:44.736 --> 21:45.835
What?

21:45.903 --> 21:48.205
You don't have to see me.

21:48.272 --> 21:52.275
I'm gonna be on an airplane
far, far away.

21:52.343 --> 21:55.345
Oh.

21:55.412 --> 21:57.814
It's my Christmas gift to you.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.950
Uh-huh.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.153
So, how do you like
your present?

22:03.220 --> 22:04.654
Like it? L-Like it? I love it.

22:04.722 --> 22:06.556
It's perfect.
     How-How did you know?

22:06.624 --> 22:08.992
Well, it was either that,
          or a shirt.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.193
(laughs)

22:10.261 --> 22:11.595
(laughs)

22:11.662 --> 22:16.199
Well, anyway, um...

22:16.267 --> 22:17.600
so long as, you know,

22:17.668 --> 22:21.404
I'm not gonna be here
   New Year's Eve, uh, um...

22:21.472 --> 22:23.974
could I have my kiss now?

22:24.041 --> 22:25.141
Hm?

22:25.209 --> 22:26.744
Oh, come on, Phyllis,
       please, will you?

22:26.811 --> 22:27.911
Come on, Alex.

22:27.979 --> 22:29.112
No. Come on,
                        let's...
            Come on.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.714
Just give me
    a little kiss. Come on.
                        Phyllis.

22:30.781 --> 22:31.882
Phyllis,
                       please...
Alex, come on.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.717
Come on, let's just pretend,
you know...

22:33.785 --> 22:35.752
I don't want...
              I don't want to...

22:35.820 --> 22:38.254
Alex, come on, we'll just
pretend it's New Year's Eve.

22:38.322 --> 22:40.423
Okay? Right here.
               No, we don't have

22:40.491 --> 22:41.591
to do this.
          Four...

22:41.659 --> 22:42.759
Phyllis...
          Three...

22:42.827 --> 22:43.960
Oh, come on, Phyllis.

22:44.028 --> 22:45.361
Two...
          Please, please.

22:45.429 --> 22:46.530
One.
              Why don't you just

22:46.597 --> 22:47.731
make it a nice...

22:47.798 --> 22:49.132
¶ Should auld
acquaintance ¶

22:49.199 --> 22:50.800
Phyllis, Phyllis,
                      stop that.

22:50.868 --> 22:52.770
¶ Be forgot
                        Phyllis,
             Phyllis, stop that.

22:52.837 --> 22:54.304
I'm not gonna
                 do it, Phyllis.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.273
¶ And never
brought to mind...¶

22:56.340 --> 22:58.041
Phyllis!

23:24.401 --> 23:26.636
Happy New Year, Phyllis.

23:26.704 --> 23:29.239
Happy New Year, Alex.

23:38.449 --> 23:42.085
(theme song playing)

24:02.940 --> 24:04.408
WOMAN:
  <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:04.475 --> 24:05.775
