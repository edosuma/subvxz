WEBVTT

00:03.815 --> 00:04.814
Richard.

00:05.887 --> 00:07.667
Okay, I'll carry your pack
all day long

00:07.767 --> 00:08.946
if you give me ten more minutes.

00:09.698 --> 00:11.198
Are you all right?

00:11.622 --> 00:12.922
Have a heart, Zedd.

00:15.353 --> 00:17.153
Richard, it's me, Michael.

00:23.076 --> 00:24.176
Michael.

00:25.087 --> 00:26.587
How did you--?

00:28.260 --> 00:29.560
How did I get here?

00:30.575 --> 00:33.275
Some guards found you at the bottom
of the cliff and carried you home.

00:33.422 --> 00:35.222
You've been out for two days.

00:35.715 --> 00:37.115
That's not true.

00:37.534 --> 00:38.734
Where's Zedd?

00:38.860 --> 00:40.846
Where's Kahlan?
How did I get through the boundary?

00:40.946 --> 00:42.725
You're not making sense,
you should be lying down.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.018
You had quite a fall.

00:44.939 --> 00:46.323
This is some
kind of trick, isn't it?

00:46.423 --> 00:47.223
Richard...

00:47.289 --> 00:48.570
Well, it's not going to work.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.566
I know it wasn't
Kahlan who killed Dad.

00:50.673 --> 00:52.497
I know it was Fane,
and you helped him!

00:52.597 --> 00:54.172
Richard,
what are you talking about?

00:54.718 --> 00:56.718
I'm talking about Dad dying

00:56.863 --> 00:58.163
right outside that door!

01:00.380 --> 01:02.280
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but it was too late.

01:04.215 --> 01:05.015
Dad...

01:08.032 --> 01:09.832
I felt the life go out of him.

01:12.211 --> 01:13.011
Richard!

01:14.688 --> 01:16.088
We saw the smoke.

01:17.031 --> 01:18.231
What happened?

01:19.457 --> 01:20.757
He's dead.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.329 --> 01:33.929
You accused me, your own brother.

01:35.015 --> 01:37.115
Did the witch make you do this?

01:37.451 --> 01:39.131
Michael, you can't
possibly believe--

01:39.231 --> 01:40.811
I don't know what to believe!

01:41.858 --> 01:43.642
- It was Ransyn Fane.
- No.

01:43.742 --> 01:45.926
He is with Chase, looking for you.

01:46.702 --> 01:48.102
You're not going anywhere.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.008
Take him.

01:53.336 --> 01:54.436
Stay back!

01:57.249 --> 01:58.249
Witchcraft...

01:59.023 --> 02:00.423
Fane was right.

02:07.223 --> 02:09.023
You would've had me arrested

02:09.124 --> 02:10.906
and who knows what else,
if I hadn't gotten away.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.788
I'm calling a healer,
you must've hit your head--

02:12.929 --> 02:14.716
Tell me what you did to Zedd and Kahlan

02:14.816 --> 02:16.602
or I swear I'll beat it outta you!

02:16.872 --> 02:17.872
Richard.

02:18.999 --> 02:21.099
Son,
you're up and about.

02:22.381 --> 02:23.181
Dad?

02:23.289 --> 02:25.089
Oh, thank the Spirits.

02:29.112 --> 02:31.412
Legend of the Seeker S01E12:
"Home"

02:32.140 --> 02:34.240
subtitle by rogard

02:35.142 --> 02:36.342
It wasn't a dream.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.857
I've been gone for months.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.033
I fought battles. I--

02:42.243 --> 02:43.743
I've killed people.

02:48.317 --> 02:51.117
I fell asleep in the forest
with Zedd and Kahlan, and then--

02:53.518 --> 02:55.118
I know what happened.

02:55.559 --> 02:57.151
Darken Rahl used some kind of magic

02:57.251 --> 02:59.062
to wind the clock back to the
day I met Kahlan,

02:59.212 --> 03:00.593
to right before it all began.

03:00.693 --> 03:01.973
Who's "Kahlan"?

03:02.123 --> 03:03.423
She's a confessor.

03:04.047 --> 03:05.847
She came through the Boundary
with the Book of Counted Shadows,

03:05.954 --> 03:07.154
looking for me.

03:10.330 --> 03:11.830
The D'Harans were after her.

03:12.845 --> 03:14.445
They were hunting her like an animal.

03:15.039 --> 03:17.039
They chased her all the
way across the Midlands,

03:17.166 --> 03:18.366
and through the boundary,

03:18.961 --> 03:20.261
trying to kill her.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.760
I had to help her.

03:34.662 --> 03:37.452
They cornered her at the edge of
Dead Man's Cliff.

03:37.552 --> 03:38.642
Stay back.

03:38.779 --> 03:39.979
Shoot her.

03:43.593 --> 03:45.093
Leave her alone!

03:46.154 --> 03:47.954
You're making a mistake, boy.

03:48.818 --> 03:50.218
This girl is dangerous.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.419
Four men against one woman?

03:54.547 --> 03:56.347
I think she's the one in danger.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.705
...and go home.

03:59.020 --> 04:00.520
I'm not going anywhere.

04:05.074 --> 04:05.874
Easy.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.450
Do not let her grasp you.

04:10.949 --> 04:13.114
They were scared of her.

04:13.214 --> 04:15.749
She used magic against them.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.536
Using her power made her weak.

04:44.855 --> 04:47.432
It's over for you, Confessor.

05:05.321 --> 05:06.510
We were at the edge of the cliff.

05:08.874 --> 05:10.102
The fall should've killed him...

05:10.714 --> 05:13.718
but when I looked over,
he was gone.

05:15.135 --> 05:16.871
He fell a 100 feet
and walked away.

05:23.356 --> 05:27.011
Whoever would've thought my son
would have such a vivid imagination?

05:27.416 --> 05:30.499
Richard, not so much as a
mosquito has ever crossed the Boundary.

05:30.947 --> 05:32.484
Everybody knows it's impenetrable.

05:32.584 --> 05:34.088
Well, then everybody is wrong.

05:35.806 --> 05:37.093
I need to talk to Zedd.

05:37.775 --> 05:40.235
What, the crazy old man
who talks to his chickens?

05:41.918 --> 05:43.274
Why would you wanna talk to him?

05:44.402 --> 05:45.768
Don't try to stop me.

06:02.378 --> 06:03.369
Zedd.

06:04.370 --> 06:05.928
Something terrible's happened.

06:06.386 --> 06:07.695
Darken Rahl did some kind of spell

06:07.794 --> 06:09.807
that sent me bck to the day
I first came here.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.721
But I know everything.
I know I'm the seeker--

06:11.821 --> 06:14.168
Slow dows, slow down.

06:15.355 --> 06:18.090
You're Richard Cypher, aren't you?
George's Boy.

06:18.317 --> 06:21.246
Grown up to be a fine figure
of a young man, don't you think, Clara?

06:22.722 --> 06:24.445
Zedd, I know who you are.

06:25.095 --> 06:26.606
I know you brought me here
from the Midlands,

06:26.705 --> 06:28.580
I know you've been watching
over me my whole life.

06:30.386 --> 06:32.559
He fell off Dead Man's Bluff
and hit his head.

06:32.823 --> 06:34.045
He's gotten them all miced up.

06:34.574 --> 06:37.908
Zedd, tell 'em it's true.
Tell 'em you're a wizard.

06:38.683 --> 06:44.326
Wow, that's a new one. Imagine,
someone taking me for a wizard.

06:46.523 --> 06:49.901
He's pretending, because he doesn't
trust you, but it's true.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.648
I got bit by some kind of vine that Kahlan
brought through the Boundary.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.711
It made me sick,
I fell off my horse,

06:56.399 --> 06:59.093
and when I came to,
I was right there, on that bed.

07:00.835 --> 07:02.242
You healed me with magic.

07:20.369 --> 07:21.714
His fever's broken.

07:22.889 --> 07:24.299
Now take me to the Seeker.

07:25.606 --> 07:27.040
He's here.

07:27.288 --> 07:30.083
It turned out I was the person
she came all this way looking for.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.504
Him?

07:32.759 --> 07:35.276
- But-- But he's--
- Waht? Not good enough?

07:35.603 --> 07:37.013
YOu wanted the Seeker, there he is.

07:38.007 --> 07:40.770
If he's not up to your standard,
well, that's fine by me.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.314
You find yourself another.

07:42.476 --> 07:44.760
Seeker? What are you talking about?

07:50.183 --> 07:51.264
You never told him?

07:53.652 --> 07:55.828
You were supposed to train him.

07:56.378 --> 07:57.799
Prepare him.

07:57.979 --> 08:00.257
What have you been doing
for the last 20 years?

08:01.179 --> 08:02.710
Letting him catch worms,

08:03.605 --> 08:05.711
steal apples, skin his knees,

08:06.103 --> 08:08.739
Find out what makes
his heart beat faster.

08:08.839 --> 08:11.184
My sister gave her life
to make sure that I got here,

08:12.242 --> 08:14.716
to make sure that I put the book
in the Seeker's hands,

08:14.816 --> 08:16.192
and he's catching worms?

08:16.291 --> 08:18.679
Never knew a great man who didn't
have a little dirt under his nails.

08:18.779 --> 08:20.482
And while he's getting his nails dirty,

08:20.883 --> 08:23.489
did it ever occur to you
to give him the slightest inkling

08:23.588 --> 08:27.296
that he is the first true Seeker
in a thousand years?

08:27.952 --> 08:29.431
He has a destiny.

08:30.119 --> 08:32.296
Who are you to decide
a man's destiny?

08:32.775 --> 08:36.527
- It's not me, it's the Prophecy.
- Prophecy be damned.

08:36.626 --> 08:37.703
Stop!

08:39.148 --> 08:42.025
Who are you talking about?
And what's a "Seeker"?

08:42.924 --> 08:45.617
And then you told me that it was
my destiny to kill Darken Rahl,

08:45.716 --> 08:47.104
the leader of the D'Harans.

08:47.203 --> 08:48.736
And then you gave me
the Sword of Truth.

08:49.814 --> 08:51.182
"Sword of Truth"?

08:52.141 --> 08:53.654
Just right over there.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.151
It was invisible.
You pulled it out of the air.

09:00.111 --> 09:01.760
We'd give all our toes and feathers

09:01.859 --> 09:05.029
if our lives only could be so
exciting, wouldn't we, Clara?

09:10.227 --> 09:11.810
I can't believe I
could've dreamed all that.

09:13.057 --> 09:15.036
I'm not dead, Richard.

09:15.136 --> 09:16.562
I'm right here,

09:17.092 --> 09:18.744
and I'm not going anywhere.

09:36.933 --> 09:38.119
If all of this is real,

09:39.400 --> 09:40.908
and everything that happened
was a dream,

09:43.330 --> 09:44.733
then there's no Kahlan.

09:47.779 --> 09:48.997
She doesn't exist.

09:49.217 --> 09:50.995
Yes, I do. Richard, I'm right here.

09:52.652 --> 09:54.291
She's just something I dreamed.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.135
No, Richard. You're dreaming now.

09:57.885 --> 09:58.991
Wake up!

10:00.400 --> 10:03.128
- What is it?
- He's talking in his sleep.

10:04.047 --> 10:05.922
How could all of that just had been a dream?

10:06.720 --> 10:07.838
I can't wake him.

10:11.824 --> 10:14.215
- You won't be able to.
- What do you mean?

10:14.574 --> 10:18.044
The three stars of Amberlis appear
within the circle of the crescent moon

10:18.144 --> 10:19.795
once every 119 years.

10:20.892 --> 10:21.996
And when they do,

10:22.401 --> 10:25.643
it becomes possible to cast
the spell of a Lying Moon.

10:26.065 --> 10:28.811
- What kind of spell is that?
- Powerful magic.

10:28.981 --> 10:31.394
It causes the victim to fall
into a sleep where he believes

10:31.494 --> 10:33.873
that he is among friends
when he is among enemies.

10:35.183 --> 10:38.684
And in that dream,
a man will reveal secrets

10:38.798 --> 10:42.930
that in his waking life he would
only share with those he trusts most.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.817
Who would have done this to Richard?
And why?

10:46.514 --> 10:49.981
Only one wizard in the world besides
me is capable of working this magic,

10:50.610 --> 10:53.717
and that wizard works for Darken Rahl.

10:55.082 --> 10:56.295
Well, we have to get him out
of the moonlight.

10:56.395 --> 10:58.731
It's too late. The spell has
already taken hold.

10:58.831 --> 11:00.061
Well, can't you undo it?

11:00.481 --> 11:02.382
I can try.

11:04.079 --> 11:05.609
What's going to happen to him?

11:08.969 --> 11:12.166
Do you see how one star is beginning
to disappear behind the moon?

11:12.830 --> 11:15.652
If we can't get him out
before all three stars have gone,

11:16.657 --> 11:17.998
we may never gett him out.

11:23.722 --> 11:26.082
Richard, there's nobody called Kahlan.

11:26.623 --> 11:28.504
And Zedd isn't a wizard.

11:29.028 --> 11:30.640
We need to get him to a healer.

11:30.740 --> 11:33.473
The boy doesn't need a healer.

11:33.573 --> 11:35.171
He just needs a little time.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.905
I only wished I had the powers
you dreamed up for me,

11:39.594 --> 11:41.969
but I do know a few
little healing tricks.

11:43.106 --> 11:46.641
and one of them is that there's no cure
for the frightening grip of a nightmare

11:46.741 --> 11:49.423
like telling it to
a friendly listener.

11:50.186 --> 11:52.029
And there's no-one friendlier than Clara.

11:53.376 --> 11:54.769
So tell us,

11:54.956 --> 11:56.848
did you take up this sword?

11:56.948 --> 11:59.991
Did you defeat this dastardly Rannsyn Fane?

12:02.811 --> 12:06.343
Come, Richard. At the very least,
it'll make a good story.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.653
It doesn't feel like a story.

12:09.753 --> 12:11.364
I know, but tell it anyway.

12:11.922 --> 12:13.954
I promise you, it'll do you good.

12:17.123 --> 12:18.495
Go on, son.

12:22.344 --> 12:27.421
And after I rode home,
after Dad died in the burning house,

12:30.141 --> 12:31.505
I came after Fane,

12:32.500 --> 12:33.781
but he got away.

12:34.732 --> 12:36.502
He was heading for the Boundary.

12:38.359 --> 12:40.064
We raced after him,

12:41.595 --> 12:42.968
I fought him.

12:48.205 --> 12:49.226
We had to stop him.

12:49.326 --> 12:51.248
He had the Book of Counted Shadows.

12:51.844 --> 12:54.484
If Rahl got the book,
it would've given him the serets of power.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.956
I didn't know how
I was able to fight like that.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.563
It was like I was getting some kind
of power from the sword.

13:38.803 --> 13:42.904
I felt rage, anger,
like I've never felt before.

13:45.769 --> 13:47.189
I was the bringer of death.

14:07.501 --> 14:09.515
It was the first time
I ever killed anybody,

14:11.274 --> 14:12.423
but not the last.

14:18.398 --> 14:19.655
You did it.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.702
You are the Seeker.

14:25.815 --> 14:28.330
Fascinating! Incomparable!

14:29.052 --> 14:31.378
Magical swords, magical vines.

14:32.252 --> 14:35.282
I admit I always had a fondness
for this sort of tale.

14:36.103 --> 14:39.332
What other wondrous objects
did you come upon?

14:39.861 --> 14:41.255
This isn't funny to me.

14:42.151 --> 14:43.652
Forgive me, forgive me.

14:43.753 --> 14:46.222
I've just gotten so
caught up in the story.

14:46.876 --> 14:48.563
Please, keep going.

14:48.913 --> 14:51.711
A little pleasure to a lonely old man.

14:53.178 --> 14:55.221
Well, there were a lot of magical objects,

14:56.681 --> 14:59.909
but nothing as amazing
as the magical people.

15:00.791 --> 15:03.377
I met a boy who could see
what people are thinking,

15:03.477 --> 15:04.708
like he was reading a book.

15:04.807 --> 15:07.727
Now there is a trick I'd like
to have up my sleeve.

15:08.489 --> 15:10.033
Tell us about him.

15:12.306 --> 15:14.426
Well, we had to save him from the D'Harans,

15:15.152 --> 15:17.659
so Darken Rahl couldn't
get control of his powers.

15:20.176 --> 15:21.930
It's okay. We're friends.

15:22.030 --> 15:24.288
We just wanna take you home.

15:27.315 --> 15:29.274
But he didn't ecactly
wanted to be saved.

15:31.065 --> 15:32.925
He was used to getting his own way.

15:34.159 --> 15:36.275
I want pheasant with blackberry sauce.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.526
Well, the first pheasant I see is all yours.

15:39.816 --> 15:41.831
I saw a nest of pheasants a mile back,

15:42.128 --> 15:43.834
and there were blackberries growing all over.

15:43.934 --> 15:45.488
No, we don't have time.

15:45.728 --> 15:47.789
If you're in a hurry,
I'm not stopping you.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.349
I'll just wait right here
for the D'Harans to find me.

15:51.591 --> 15:56.180
Listen, we're not stopping
to pick blackberries and hunt pheasant.

15:58.505 --> 16:02.455
Then I guess I'll have to tell her about
the secret you've been keeping from her.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.550
I don't have any secrets with Kahlan.

16:08.650 --> 16:09.806
I'm a Listener.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.322
Do you think there is anything
you can hide from me?

16:12.646 --> 16:16.128
How would you like her to know
what you think about when you look at her?

16:17.271 --> 16:20.789
I blush to think of what thoughts
the little monster may have glimpsed.

16:21.818 --> 16:23.113
Well, he wasn't so bad.

16:23.632 --> 16:26.257
Once the D'Harans attacked us and
he saw what they are really about,

16:26.887 --> 16:28.455
he started to trust us.

16:29.815 --> 16:34.457
It's okay. It's just an owl,
complaining about something.

16:36.383 --> 16:37.829
The way owls do.

16:39.175 --> 16:40.539
Does it still hurt?

16:42.038 --> 16:45.024
I would say no, but you'd know
I'd be lying.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.376
Why haven't you told
what you feel about her?

16:58.065 --> 16:59.399
It's complicated.

17:01.662 --> 17:03.451
You'll understand when you get older.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.141
It's not that complicated.

17:06.846 --> 17:09.387
You're just scared
she doesn't feel the same way.

17:11.961 --> 17:13.459
But you don't have to be scared.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.886
She feels the same way you do.

17:28.463 --> 17:30.141
I don't wanna talk about this any more.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.293
Richard, come back!

17:38.393 --> 17:41.428
You need to rest yourself and stay calm.

17:42.552 --> 17:44.881
A blow to the head
can be a dangerous thing.

17:48.349 --> 17:49.868
Be careful, Lord Rahl.

17:50.273 --> 17:53.708
If you push him too hard,
you could shatter the spell.

17:54.496 --> 17:56.568
I will push him as hard as I have to,

17:58.646 --> 18:03.101
until he tells me where
he's hidden the third Box of Orden.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.645
The deeper the spell takes him,
the more the fever will rage.

18:30.605 --> 18:34.867
Richard, your father and your brother
are worried sick about you.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.729
Come back.

18:41.636 --> 18:44.356
What is it, boy?
You can talk to me.

18:49.325 --> 18:50.983
I can't believe
Kahlan is not real.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.687
How could I just imagine
feeling that way about somebody?

18:57.711 --> 19:00.020
We all have our little fantasies.

19:01.730 --> 19:03.292
I'd like to be alone right now.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.262
I'm not getting anywhere.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.740
The idiot's gone and fallen
in love with this confessor.

19:17.999 --> 19:19.604
She's all he can think about.

19:20.888 --> 19:23.295
Now, why can't I just reach into his mind

19:23.496 --> 19:25.566
and see where he hid the box?

19:26.359 --> 19:28.848
Childhood memories are easy, Lord Rahl.

19:29.622 --> 19:31.168
But a secret as important
to the seeker

19:31.269 --> 19:32.712
as where he has hidden the box

19:33.338 --> 19:35.731
is sure to be locked away
where even the magic of Amberlis

19:35.831 --> 19:37.764
has to work hard to find it.

19:39.241 --> 19:42.984
As for his love of his confessor,
he's a young man like any other.

19:43.468 --> 19:45.479
Surely there's a girl he left behind,

19:45.579 --> 19:48.579
some fresh-faced maiden of the forest

19:48.714 --> 19:51.806
who can draw his thoughts
away from Kahlan Amnell.

20:03.014 --> 20:04.118
Richard.

20:06.367 --> 20:07.245
Anna.

20:08.149 --> 20:09.488
What are you doing here?
How did you get--?

20:09.625 --> 20:12.650
I came as soon as I heard.
South Haven to Hartland two days.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.081
Let somebody try and beat that.

20:19.361 --> 20:23.026
Do you hate me? For moving away,
for never writing?

20:26.327 --> 20:28.618
I was angry for a long time, but...

20:29.276 --> 20:31.179
I could never hate you, Anna.

20:35.336 --> 20:37.657
Only Richard Cypher would be crazy enough

20:37.757 --> 20:40.405
to go running around
the edge of Dead Man's Cliff.

20:40.954 --> 20:42.267
What were you thinking?

20:42.368 --> 20:43.981
I was helping somebody.

20:44.851 --> 20:47.051
- The woman in the white dress?
- You saw her too?

20:47.197 --> 20:49.180
No. I went to your house,

20:49.667 --> 20:52.193
and your brother and your father
told me about your dream.

21:00.057 --> 21:02.504
Tell me what happened
in this other place.

21:03.265 --> 21:06.394
For a dream to be that real,
there must be something important in it.

21:07.043 --> 21:08.779
Somwthing you can learn from it.

21:12.869 --> 21:15.538
Richard, do you remember
that little black dog you had,

21:15.672 --> 21:17.897
that got swept away in the big flood?

21:18.875 --> 21:19.861
Arrow.

21:21.718 --> 21:24.510
We were, what, seven years old?

21:24.610 --> 21:26.829
You ran away and nobody could find you.

21:26.929 --> 21:28.354
I was hiding in the cellar.

21:28.910 --> 21:31.108
'Cause you didn't want anyone
to see you crying.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.059
You stayed there all day,

21:34.194 --> 21:37.236
and you told me all about
Arrow's great heroic deeds.

21:37.751 --> 21:40.641
And then you went home
and nobody ever saw a tear on your face.

21:41.846 --> 21:43.176
Except me.

21:46.487 --> 21:49.518
Talk to me Richard. Get it out.
Tell me everything.

21:49.751 --> 21:52.534
Tell me the worst, scariest
thing that happened.

21:54.366 --> 21:56.144
It was one scary thing after another.

21:56.594 --> 21:57.950
Like what?

21:58.531 --> 21:59.450
Well...

22:00.700 --> 22:02.841
nothing was scarier than the Mord-Sith.

22:14.174 --> 22:15.840
No-one's going to train me.

22:16.590 --> 22:18.484
Did you not feel my Agiel?

22:21.761 --> 22:26.344
The harder you fight, the more
painful its magic will become.

22:29.798 --> 22:32.632
And after I've finished training you with it,

22:33.440 --> 22:35.641
you'll do anything to please me.

22:36.831 --> 22:38.146
Anything.

22:40.344 --> 22:44.445
And nothing would please me more
than to see the Seeker...

22:46.191 --> 22:48.492
...stand at the gates of the People's Palace,

22:48.985 --> 22:51.096
and there before the multitudes

22:51.813 --> 22:54.777
take the hand of Lord Rahl

22:54.878 --> 22:58.522
and pledge his undying love
and fealty to him.

23:00.565 --> 23:01.476
No.

23:02.925 --> 23:04.739
I'm going to take that sword,

23:05.971 --> 23:08.005
and I'm going to kill him with it...

23:10.256 --> 23:12.030
after I killed you.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.489
I do enjoy a challenge.

23:17.739 --> 23:19.510
Shall we begin?

23:22.035 --> 23:24.261
Nothing in a dream could hurt like that.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.227
Nothing in a dream could leave a...
scar.

23:28.221 --> 23:30.679
Anna, it left a scar, right here.

23:42.336 --> 23:45.128
Just keep telling it, Richard.
Keep getting it out.

23:45.775 --> 23:47.950
How did you escape from that horrible place?

23:48.634 --> 23:50.953
- Kahlan triewd to save me.
- Who's Kahlan?

23:51.400 --> 23:52.724
The woman in white.

23:54.940 --> 23:57.361
I don't even know how long
I'd been in that dungeon.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.609
I was completely under Denna's power.

24:00.846 --> 24:02.960
Do it now.

24:04.286 --> 24:05.781
Kill her.

24:06.831 --> 24:08.099
I can't.

24:08.207 --> 24:10.725
Then watch her suffer.

24:13.978 --> 24:15.625
End her pain, Richard.

24:22.551 --> 24:23.866
She wouldn't give up.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.876
She was testing me,
tormenting me.

24:35.635 --> 24:38.253
But something stopped me.

24:47.648 --> 24:48.993
I was so close.

24:53.037 --> 24:54.555
I can't explain it.

25:39.531 --> 25:44.111
Any magic you use against a Mord-Sith
comes back at you ten times stronger.

25:45.039 --> 25:47.306
With more pain than you
could possibly imagine.

26:03.742 --> 26:05.024
How did you...?

26:07.974 --> 26:10.379
You taught me how to withstand pain.

26:22.052 --> 26:23.949
That's quite a dream.

26:25.087 --> 26:27.861
You almost died for this Kahlan.

26:28.467 --> 26:30.365
Not as many times as
she almost died for me.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.604
Does she look like me?

26:35.396 --> 26:36.432
No.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.194
Richard, going with my parents
when they moved to South Haven

26:41.414 --> 26:43.591
was the stupidest thing I ever did.

26:44.093 --> 26:47.160
You were 19, you could've stayed.
Why didn't you?

26:48.369 --> 26:50.774
All our lives,
from when we were five years old,

26:50.909 --> 26:53.704
it was always
"Richard and Anna were born for each other."

26:53.804 --> 26:55.898
"What are you gonna wear to the wedding?"

26:56.648 --> 26:58.676
You were the only man I'd ever kissed.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.982
Took hearing that you'd fallen off
that cliff and almost died

27:03.082 --> 27:04.551
for me to realize that...

27:06.689 --> 27:08.928
you're the only man I ever wanna kiss.

27:11.529 --> 27:14.412
Sorry that I don't have magical powers

27:16.265 --> 27:18.702
and I'm not much ggod in a knife fight,

27:20.049 --> 27:21.689
but I love you, Richard.

27:23.922 --> 27:25.485
Am I too late?

27:26.660 --> 27:29.462
- Do you still care for me?
- Yes, I care for you, Anna.

27:30.103 --> 27:31.131
Anna?

27:32.606 --> 27:33.903
Who's Anna?

27:34.597 --> 27:36.293
I will always care for you, but--

27:47.196 --> 27:50.483
You're home, Richard.
You're home with me.

27:52.602 --> 27:54.771
And I'm never leaving you again.

28:02.544 --> 28:04.193
He's in my hands.

28:06.323 --> 28:09.370
- Now to find the box.
- Not yet, Lord Rahl.

28:10.103 --> 28:13.236
If you move too fast,
if he suspects the truth,

28:14.044 --> 28:18.306
and he is the Seeker of Truth after all,
the spell will shatter.

28:20.119 --> 28:21.569
Keep pulling him in.

28:30.183 --> 28:31.061
So,

28:32.411 --> 28:34.316
what happened with this woman in white?

28:34.591 --> 28:36.715
- Did you marry her?
- No.

28:37.747 --> 28:39.302
Well, that's good.

28:39.402 --> 28:43.387
I wouldn't want you marrying somebody else,
not even in a dream.

28:43.862 --> 28:45.833
Actually, I did marry somebody else.

28:45.983 --> 28:46.783
Oh.

28:47.785 --> 28:49.554
Well, not really.

28:50.504 --> 28:51.973
It's complicated.

28:52.858 --> 28:54.274
A powerful witch put a spell on me

28:54.375 --> 28:57.095
that made everybody who looked at me
think I was somebody else.

28:58.466 --> 28:59.807
Even Kahlan.

29:00.376 --> 29:01.669
What are you doing?

29:03.093 --> 29:04.944
Put down Richard's sword, Gryff.

29:08.459 --> 29:10.513
The Sword of Truth is not a toy.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.480
What's going on?

29:12.706 --> 29:14.809
How did Gryff get his hands
on your sword, Richard?

29:16.172 --> 29:17.439
No harm done.

29:17.648 --> 29:19.951
The Sword of Truth belongs
in the hands of the Seeker.

29:20.201 --> 29:22.291
This is insane. It's me, Richard.

29:22.841 --> 29:25.924
Bronwyn is a very lucky girl.
You'll make a fine husband.

29:26.614 --> 29:28.095
I think we should get moving.

29:32.151 --> 29:33.668
To Lord Rahl.

29:33.934 --> 29:37.069
They all thought I was Gryff,
the son of a wealthy merchant,

29:37.207 --> 29:39.417
betrothed to a girl named Bronwyn.

29:40.755 --> 29:43.254
If these things are uncomfortable,
we can take them off.

29:43.771 --> 29:45.039
What's wrong with you?

29:45.311 --> 29:48.419
You know tradition doesn't allow it.
It stays on until morning.

29:49.946 --> 29:53.052
After we've spent our first night together
as man and wife.

29:54.903 --> 29:56.656
There are a lot of things I want to say.

29:56.853 --> 30:00.242
First, let me start by
wishing my little sister

30:00.592 --> 30:02.314
and her new husband

30:02.725 --> 30:05.375
many, many children. And--

30:05.476 --> 30:07.754
I wish we'd get started on that right away.

30:08.949 --> 30:11.861
So, in your dream, did you actually...?

30:12.275 --> 30:13.875
No, no, no.

30:14.005 --> 30:15.419
I had to get out of there.

30:16.005 --> 30:19.474
Zedd and Kahlan were on their way
to the ancient ruin city of Kelabra,

30:19.724 --> 30:21.790
where Darken Rahl was
massing hundreds of men.

30:22.708 --> 30:24.943
What was Rahl looking for in the ruins?

30:25.599 --> 30:27.102
Did you ever find out?

30:27.214 --> 30:31.350
Yes. And it turned out to something more
important than we could've ever imagined.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.522
- It was the second Box of Orden.
- Richard.

30:34.623 --> 30:38.180
Just as I feared. Rahl is trying to
find out where the box is.

30:38.427 --> 30:40.287
Richard, don't say any more.

30:41.350 --> 30:42.497
You see,

30:42.978 --> 30:47.010
each one of these boxes contained
unbelievably powerful magic.

30:47.380 --> 30:50.185
Rahl had the first box.
He found the second in Kelabra.

30:50.902 --> 30:52.757
All through the dream, Zedd and
Kahlan kept telling me,

30:52.857 --> 30:57.082
if he got all three, he would have
the power to enslave the world.

30:57.448 --> 30:59.732
We had to get the third box
before Rahl did.

31:00.060 --> 31:00.908
Richard!

31:01.009 --> 31:02.410
What did I tell you, Lord Rahl?

31:02.531 --> 31:04.171
Your patience has been rewarded.

31:07.539 --> 31:08.957
Where was it, Richard?

31:10.006 --> 31:11.798
Where was the third Box of Orden?

31:12.148 --> 31:14.904
The box was in the treasure room
at Tamarang,

31:15.355 --> 31:17.240
the most heavily guarded castle
in the Midlands.

31:20.836 --> 31:23.347
The only way to get in was for Zedd
to enter a competition

31:23.447 --> 31:26.150
to be an entertainer at
Princess Violet's birthday party.

31:26.515 --> 31:28.606
Greetings, Your Highness.

31:29.310 --> 31:32.183
But apparently Princess Violet
was very hard to please.

31:34.572 --> 31:36.242
Hello, Princess Violet.

31:36.492 --> 31:39.910
I'm Mr. Stocking. Happy Birthday.

31:42.508 --> 31:43.461
Guards!

31:43.562 --> 31:47.014
Throw this idiot off the grounds
before I chop off his head.

31:47.114 --> 31:50.660
Forgive me, Your Magnificence,
for disappointing you.

31:51.718 --> 31:53.415
Hey! Where are you going without me?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.231
What do you mean,
where am I going without you?

31:56.331 --> 31:59.277
I've lost the job because of you,
you worthless stinking rag.

31:59.477 --> 32:01.244
First you blame me for losing the job,

32:01.344 --> 32:03.161
now you blame me for being stinky!

32:03.637 --> 32:07.287
Somthing sure smells around here,
but it isn't me.

32:10.193 --> 32:11.550
You're hired.

32:13.682 --> 32:17.427
Ruben Rybnik, Grand Puppeteer.

32:17.528 --> 32:21.072
At Her Majesty's service.

32:22.881 --> 32:24.327
Once Zedd was inside the castle,

32:25.419 --> 32:27.784
he managed to steal the key
to the treasure room.

32:33.195 --> 32:36.290
He used his magic to turn
an ordinary spice box

32:36.696 --> 32:39.709
into a perfect copy of the
third Box of Orden.

32:40.787 --> 32:42.481
But that wasn't the end of the story.

32:43.913 --> 32:46.655
What are you doing in here?

32:47.866 --> 32:51.603
Forgive me, Princess.
My-- my curiosity overcame me.

32:51.932 --> 32:53.990
How stupid to you think I am?

32:54.131 --> 32:56.701
You have two seconds
to tell me what's going on

32:56.975 --> 32:59.977
before I scream my head off
and wake up the whole casstle.

33:03.883 --> 33:05.416
You may want to turn
and look in the mirror

33:05.516 --> 33:07.207
before you make good on that threat.

33:11.621 --> 33:13.570
My face! My beautiful face!

33:13.993 --> 33:15.049
What have you done to me?

33:15.150 --> 33:18.195
Change me back right now,
or I'll chop your head off!

33:18.804 --> 33:22.076
How would you get rid of the warts
if you chopped my head off?

33:24.228 --> 33:27.961
It's called a Tattletale curse,
Your Celestial Highness.

33:28.751 --> 33:29.710
I could take it away,

33:29.811 --> 33:32.376
but if you ever even think of telling on me,

33:32.526 --> 33:33.906
the warts will reappear.

33:34.118 --> 33:35.308
Forever.

33:41.918 --> 33:45.123
Zedd gave the box to
Violet's poor servant girl Rachel.

33:45.595 --> 33:48.173
You're now the most important
person in the world.

33:48.634 --> 33:49.434
Where is it?

33:49.534 --> 33:51.134
But she had to hide
the box from Violet.

33:51.272 --> 33:52.249
What are you doing in here?

33:52.349 --> 33:53.982
Violet had very sharp eyes.

33:54.379 --> 33:56.064
Do you have something behind your back?

34:11.440 --> 34:15.704
If they'd cought Rachel, they would've
boiled her alive in molten lead.

34:16.326 --> 34:17.739
Even though she was a little girl,

34:17.840 --> 34:19.753
she was one of the bravest
people I've ever met.

34:22.324 --> 34:25.251
I finally had the
third Box of Orden in my hands.

34:25.370 --> 34:28.264
What did you do with the box,
once you had it?

34:28.888 --> 34:31.949
We were heading for a place where
Zedd thought we could hide it away safe,

34:32.050 --> 34:35.606
when we passed through a
forest crawling with D'Haran soldiers.

34:37.228 --> 34:40.168
I broke away from the others
and found a place to bury the box.

34:40.712 --> 34:44.009
Just for a little while,
until things quieted down.

34:44.275 --> 34:46.239
He's going to tell them where it is.

34:46.389 --> 34:46.927
Richard!

34:47.027 --> 34:48.560
Where could you possible bury it

34:48.659 --> 34:51.092
that would be safe enough for
something so precious?

34:51.559 --> 34:53.821
I hid it under a tree,

34:53.920 --> 34:57.549
a few leagues west of Trollsbridge.

34:57.652 --> 34:58.793
No...

35:01.324 --> 35:03.656
Send the Dragon Corps to Trollsbridge.

35:07.837 --> 35:08.976
Under a tree?

35:10.326 --> 35:12.346
Doesn't sound terribly safe to me.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.415
What kind of tree was it?

35:19.090 --> 35:21.065
What does it matter, what kind of tree?

35:21.746 --> 35:22.991
I was just wondering...

35:23.136 --> 35:26.492
if they have the same kind of trees in
dreamland as they do here.

35:27.718 --> 35:30.485
They have wayward pine,

35:31.486 --> 35:34.386
algarves, wondrous elm...

35:34.705 --> 35:36.531
How do you know about algarves?

35:37.619 --> 35:39.576
They only grow on the Midlands, not here.

35:43.806 --> 35:46.873
There were algarves in the
story books my mother used to read me.

35:47.278 --> 35:49.316
Your mother must have
read them to you too.

35:49.766 --> 35:52.005
Maybe that's how they
got into your dream.

35:54.090 --> 35:55.889
So it was an algarve?

36:00.965 --> 36:05.539
I know this is crazy, but that there
in my dream or whatever it was,

36:06.604 --> 36:11.057
the fate of the world depended on
nobody knowing where that box is, and...

36:11.888 --> 36:16.047
I don't know, it just feels wrong
to tell anyone where it is.

36:16.859 --> 36:18.631
Richard, I love you.

36:20.277 --> 36:21.619
I've always loved you.

36:21.719 --> 36:23.954
I want to make a life with you,
I know that now,

36:24.377 --> 36:26.142
now that I almost lost you.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.112
But if you don't trust me enough
to tell me something

36:30.212 --> 36:31.653
that happened to you in a dream,

36:33.558 --> 36:35.230
then what did it all mean?

36:36.839 --> 36:40.843
All those years we were together,
all the times we talked about out future.

36:40.943 --> 36:42.780
We even got names for our children.

36:44.231 --> 36:45.594
Was that all a lie?

36:46.444 --> 36:48.410
No, Anna, it wasn't a lie.

36:53.371 --> 36:56.642
These memories, these phantoms
you think are so real,

36:56.742 --> 36:59.018
they're not.
Just something from a dream.

36:59.496 --> 37:01.809
They're bad spirits trying to
drag you into the dark.

37:02.106 --> 37:04.195
and they won't let go of you
unless you show them

37:04.345 --> 37:05.870
that you don't believe their lies.

37:06.259 --> 37:07.759
Say the word.

37:09.059 --> 37:11.882
Say the name of the tree
the box was buried under.

37:12.310 --> 37:14.038
Break the chains, Richard.

37:14.138 --> 37:15.250
Break the chains!

37:15.453 --> 37:18.346
Send the bad spirits back
where they came from.

37:20.950 --> 37:23.378
I'm here, Richard. I'm right here.

37:24.637 --> 37:26.656
- Come back to me
- It's no use.

37:27.563 --> 37:29.703
The Spell of the Lying Moon
is impenetrable.

37:30.406 --> 37:32.282
No. No.

37:32.432 --> 37:33.692
I can get through.

37:34.176 --> 37:35.663
I know that I can.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.411
Richard, it's me, Kahlan.

37:39.353 --> 37:40.968
Don't listen to what they're telling you.

37:41.795 --> 37:44.131
Remember all the things
we've been through.

37:45.185 --> 37:46.758
Think of me, Richard.

37:48.702 --> 37:50.189
I'm right here.

37:51.499 --> 37:52.947
I need you, Richard.

37:53.497 --> 37:55.399
I need you here with me.

38:00.342 --> 38:02.286
That night, in the forest,

38:05.095 --> 38:07.231
I never wanted that kiss to end.

38:12.406 --> 38:15.277
And the next day,
when you stopped me on the path,

38:17.298 --> 38:19.905
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have the same feelings for me

38:20.187 --> 38:21.725
that I have for you.

38:23.641 --> 38:25.533
I don't have any feelings for you,

38:26.782 --> 38:28.496
and I never will.

38:29.470 --> 38:32.724
But that was a lie.
This is the truth.

38:34.568 --> 38:36.136
I love you, Richard.

38:36.786 --> 38:38.436
I love you, Richard,

38:38.536 --> 38:39.587
I love you, Richard.

38:39.687 --> 38:41.876
I love you and I never
want to lose you again.

38:45.159 --> 38:46.505
Tell me.

38:48.346 --> 38:49.924
Break the chains.

38:50.301 --> 38:52.106
Richard, come back.

38:56.908 --> 38:59.183
It's a kind of tree
that doesn't grow near here.

38:59.283 --> 39:00.083
No!

39:00.811 --> 39:02.650
Please come back to me.

39:05.318 --> 39:07.021
I love you, Richard.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.376
I love you, Richard.

39:10.556 --> 39:13.441
- You'd like it. With blossoms in the spring.
- With blssoms in the spring...?

39:21.891 --> 39:23.559
You are the Seeker.

39:24.556 --> 39:26.068
That were lies they're telling you.

39:27.037 --> 39:28.895
Use your inner power.

39:29.975 --> 39:31.789
The power to see the truth.

39:32.347 --> 39:34.026
What is it?
What's wrong?

39:36.018 --> 39:39.016
See it. See the truth.

39:39.485 --> 39:41.417
You're scaring me, Richard.

39:45.056 --> 39:47.320
Why are you looking at me like that?

39:47.457 --> 39:48.583
No!

39:52.340 --> 39:54.222
Zedd. Kahlan.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.024
We need to get the box. Fast!

40:01.779 --> 40:05.064
Cast the spell again.
I'm not finished.

40:05.410 --> 40:07.146
I'm afraid you are, my Lord.

40:07.790 --> 40:09.231
It's too late.

40:34.531 --> 40:36.144
You've been awfully quiet.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.385
Ah, I was just thinking.

40:39.587 --> 40:43.104
If you really exist,
then Zedd's really a wizard

40:43.204 --> 40:45.678
and not that chicken man
of Blackthorn Hill...

40:47.292 --> 40:49.086
...and my dad really is dead.

40:54.417 --> 40:57.070
So, how did you know it was a trick?

40:58.572 --> 41:00.232
What brought you out of it?

41:02.484 --> 41:04.770
As real as it was in every way,

41:06.527 --> 41:08.958
nothing in my life
has been more real than you.

41:10.077 --> 41:13.062
And right when I was about
to tell Anna where the box was,

41:13.447 --> 41:15.834
I suddenly absolutely knew you existed.

41:17.168 --> 41:18.740
I knew because I felt...

41:22.076 --> 41:23.803
I felt your love for me.
