WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.168
- Lieutenant Casey.
- Alderman.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.503
I got word
the shelter was closing.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.206
My understanding was we
raised more than $50,000.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.108
- Look, I don't want
to bore you with the details.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.642
- Where's the money?

00:10.644 --> 00:13.212
- That is two strikes,
Chili.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.080
- I know that I have
to get my act together,

00:15.082 --> 00:16.782
and I know that I've got
to sober up.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.250
- Well, we're here for you.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.618
[indistinct chatter]

00:19.620 --> 00:22.054
- Well, only so much
we can do.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.756
- What we busted in on today,

00:23.758 --> 00:25.491
<i>you mind telling me</i>
<i>about what we found?</i>

00:25.493 --> 00:27.393
- Don't worry.
I got it covered.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.665
- This is why I like
the fashion show.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.800
It's like every time--

00:34.802 --> 00:37.069
- If I could have
your attention.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.538
I would like to announce
next week

00:39.540 --> 00:42.107
Antonio's Boxing Gym,

00:42.109 --> 00:45.344
Trudy and I are hosting
an old-fashioned

00:45.346 --> 00:46.678
battle of the badges...

00:46.680 --> 00:50.416
- Between the heroes of 51...
- Oh-oh!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.818
- And those blockheads down at
the 21st police district...

00:52.820 --> 00:55.087
all: Boo!
- For beer and bragging rights.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.356
- I love it. That's the
best news I heard all week.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.690
- 50 bucks a head
for a good cause.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.159
- What's the cause?

01:00.161 --> 01:02.694
- Ah, it's to be determined
at this time.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.163
- All right,
let's not get bogged down

01:04.165 --> 01:05.597
with the whys and what-fors,
all right?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.534
All I care about is
who's fighting for 51.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.135
Capp, are you in?

01:10.137 --> 01:12.838
- Can't. My mom says
I have a deviated septum.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.706
- Actually,
I already volunteered.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.275
Antonio sorted it out.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.478
- My brother set it up?
Do you even know how to box?

01:19.480 --> 01:23.615
Danny and I used to go to this
MMA gym down on Diversity.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.085
- [laughs]

01:26.087 --> 01:28.587
Dude, MMA is not boxing.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.855
- Enough with the nay-saying.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.191
All this kid needs
is the right trainer,

01:32.193 --> 01:34.293
and he's gonna be ready
to bust that cop open

01:34.295 --> 01:36.128
like a donut-filled piñata.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.530
Fortunately...

01:38.532 --> 01:40.566
I'm the man for the job.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.534
[claps]
All right, come on, Candidate!

01:42.536 --> 01:45.471
We are gonna start
with some combos.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.106
I'm gonna go grab
the steaks.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.674
- Steak?
- Yeah.

01:48.676 --> 01:52.344
- <i>Engine 15, Truck 81,</i>
<i>Squad 3, Ambulance 61,</i>

01:52.346 --> 01:54.446
<i>structure fire,</i>
<i>1410 Museum Campus Drive.</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:57.116
- That's Soldier Field.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.285
[sirens blaring]

02:01.721 --> 02:04.823
- Hey, is that smoke purple?

02:09.529 --> 02:11.630
[sirens blaring]

02:17.804 --> 02:19.905
- Battalion 25 to Main,

02:19.907 --> 02:22.174
start a Level One Haz-Mat
at this location.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.642
<i>- Copy that, Battalion 25.</i>

02:23.644 --> 02:25.777
- You can get assistance
and aid down there.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.479
Walk away from the smoke.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.715
- Capp, Tony, Level A suits!
- Copy that!

02:29.717 --> 02:31.450
- Hey, Chief,
it's gonna take them

02:31.452 --> 02:35.287
Cruz and I can mask up.
We'll get a jump on evacuations.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.889
- Truck will go with
and take readings.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.291
- Okay, take one man each.
No more.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.226
You get a bad reading,
you pull out.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.628
Still don't know
what we're dealing with yet.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.563
- Cruz, let's mask up.
- Right away.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.632
- All right, Herrmann, with me.
Bring the gas meter.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.700
Let's go to work.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.739
- Let's go!
- All right.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.842
- Come on.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.720
- [coughing]

03:08.722 --> 03:10.622
- Go with the medics.
- All right, we got you.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.723
Come on.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.327
A lot of smoke in there.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.429
No heat.
No visible fire.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.298
Readings are all normal.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.934
- I need a paramedic!
- Yeah, come on.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.371
- What's your name?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.406
- Remy.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.242
- Have you had
asthma before, Remy?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.510
- Got the nebulizer prepped?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.579
- Yep, right here.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.914
Think we need
to give an epi.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.951
- No, just give it a minute.
He's good.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.893
Brett, I said no epi.

03:47.895 --> 03:48.961
- Look, he really needs it.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.696
- Who's the PIC?

03:55.635 --> 03:57.269
Remy, relax, man.
Take a deep breath.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.348
- Anybody hurt?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.749
- Gas inhalation,
asthma,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.017
A few people injured
in rout.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.552
- Hey, Chief!

04:13.554 --> 04:14.786
Smoke grenade.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.821
Military-grade.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.022
There's a bunch
of them in there.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.858
- Can I see that?

04:23.029 --> 04:24.796
Photos of everything.
Bag and tag it all.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.298
Have it to the lab
within the hour.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.533
- You mind telling us
what we're looking at?

04:28.535 --> 04:32.804
- Look, if there's anything
we need to be made aware of...

04:32.806 --> 04:35.340
- We'll be in touch, Chief.

04:49.856 --> 04:52.391
- Long night last night?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.593
What happened to drying out?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.395
- Brett, why don't you just
do me a favor

04:56.397 --> 04:57.763
and get the Albuterol
replacement

04:57.765 --> 05:00.332
and meet me
in the ambulance.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.674
- Ambo 61, right?

05:10.410 --> 05:11.943
House 51?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.512
- Yeah, Sylvie Brett.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.315
- Jen Brenner, Ambo 98.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.950
My partner, Chili,
used to be assigned there.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.419
- She was first shift.
I'm second.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.055
But she was known.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.489
Burned through
three partners

05:24.491 --> 05:26.625
before the chief
finally scraped her off.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.060
- I--I'm sorry.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.762
Scraped her off?
I thought the houses merged.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.532
- Yeah, the houses merged,
but the ambo details didn't.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.736
- [sighs]

05:37.738 --> 05:40.072
- Anyway, gotta run.
It was nice meeting you.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.107
Good luck with that one.

05:48.981 --> 05:52.084
[sirens blaring]

05:58.424 --> 05:59.925
- What's that all about?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.026
- Another bomb threat.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.928
This time in Logan Square.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.863
- Another one.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.032
- Two other hoaxes
already today.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.735
Suitcases filled
with phone books.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.079
- Hey, what's going on
out there today?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.615
- Nothing good, I'm sure.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.084
- Thinking about donating?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.853
- How could Becks not know
he was partnering

06:27.855 --> 06:29.554
with a charity-for-profit
scheme?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.690
- You said yourself,
it's for the PR.

06:31.692 --> 06:35.160
- Or he was getting a cut.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.529
And you think Antonio
would be willing to--

06:37.531 --> 06:39.064
- Investigate
a sitting alderman?

06:39.066 --> 06:42.734
- Who's skimming money
off a charity?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.936
- Matt...

06:44.938 --> 06:46.972
let's say you poke this guy
and come up empty-handed.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.907
How will you feel
when Becks retaliates?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.142
- I can handle it.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.877
- Against the house.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.783
- Chief.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.418
- Yeah?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.986
- I need to run an errand.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.954
- 30 minutes, tops.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.689
Feels like
one of those days.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.758
- I hear you.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.199
- Chili, hey.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.102
We need to talk.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.105
- Brett, I really don't want
to get into it again.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.808
It was a judgment call, okay?
We disagreed.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.075
I forgive you.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.478
- I ran into somebody
from your old house.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.147
Jen Brenner,
second shift on 98.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.850
I saw her at the ER.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.151
- Okay.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.755
- Were you forced
out of your last house

07:36.757 --> 07:39.524
because of
a drinking problem?

07:41.894 --> 07:43.462
- Well, I wouldn't say
I was forced out

07:43.464 --> 07:45.564
as much as I was
asked to leave.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.900
- Why didn't you
say anything?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.702
- Because it's embarrassing.
Why do you think?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.803
Besides, it's in the past.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.071
Why are you even
bringing this up?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.241
- Is it?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.009
Look, if drinking was
an issue before,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.811
you really have
to take it seriously now.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.146
- Okay.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.048
I can handle this myself.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.521
- Chili.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.089
[knock at door]

08:11.091 --> 08:13.191
- Come on in.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.629
- Chief.
- What's going on, Chili?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.898
- Oh, not much.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.769
Other than I need
a new partner.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.979
- What exactly is the reason?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.547
- Personality clash.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.948
- A personality clash.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.684
- It bubbled over
when we were on a call today.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.919
We were treating a patient,

08:40.921 --> 08:43.922
and Brett contradicted
a direct order.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.757
Can't have that.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.629
- Doesn't sound like
Sylvie Brett.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.768
Listen,
if there is an issue,

08:56.770 --> 08:58.904
we can all sit down together
and discuss it.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.305
- All due respect, Chief,

09:00.307 --> 09:02.741
I don't really care to hear
how we're all a family.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.711
Brett is not my family.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.813
She's a subordinate.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.084
I would really appreciate
your support.

09:16.122 --> 09:19.658
I'm just letting you know
before I call Chief Hatcher.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.033
- Uh...

09:28.901 --> 09:31.903
Headquarters is on line one.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.275
- This discussion
is not over.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.649
[door slams]

09:46.285 --> 09:47.852
- And thank you
for your donation too.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.854
It's been really good
to see you.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.022
Hey, and thanks
for coming again.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.223
I really appreciate it.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.858
- Alderman Becks.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.995
You haven't
returned my calls.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.597
- Uh, Gary, it's fine.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.131
We're fine.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.067
Uh, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

10:04.737 --> 10:06.938
Lieutenant, I, uh,
owe you an apology.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.873
- I called your charity
partners this morning.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.242
Century Philanthropy
International.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.912
Ring any bells?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.848
- Let me guess,
the line's disconnected.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.986
- You had no involvement
in their actions?

10:20.988 --> 10:22.787
- Why?
What are you suggesting?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.723
- I'm suggesting you come up
with a better answer

10:24.725 --> 10:26.324
while it's still me
asking the questions

10:26.326 --> 10:29.828
and not the press.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.396
- Let's be careful
what we say here.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.099
- You made a promise
to those victims.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.102
You make good on that,
we're square.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.270
If not, well...

10:41.073 --> 10:44.109
one thing I learned
from my speech last week,

10:44.111 --> 10:45.744
it's the power
of a firefighter

10:45.746 --> 10:47.946
standing in front
of the cameras.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.119
Just a little something
to keep in mind.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.397
- You needed me?

11:05.399 --> 11:08.433
- Sylvie, come on in.
Shut the door.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.169
Um...

11:11.171 --> 11:13.271
Complaint has been made.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.941
- [sighs]
By Chili.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.977
- She's claiming
insubordination.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.212
Said you contradicted
a direct order this morning.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.982
No, we had a disagreement
about a treatment.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.885
- Be that as it may,
she wants you detailed out.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.221
- What?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.726
You know what this
is really about, right?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.428
I just found out
that her last house

11:36.430 --> 11:38.396
handed her a pink slip
for the same sort of behavior

11:38.398 --> 11:39.931
that she's exhibited here,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.966
the drinking,
the arguing.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.807
I pushed her to get help,
and now she wants me gone.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.759
- Lieutenant.

12:07.761 --> 12:11.229
We need to convene
all the officers in the house.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.497
- Sure.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.365
Follow me.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.136
Head of Intelligence and
Analysis at Homeland Security.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.504
- Chief,
we're tracking a situation

12:19.506 --> 12:21.439
and wanted to brief
a few key firehouses.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.974
- In the last 24 hours,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.076
we're seen a dramatic increase
in terror threats,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.978
like the ones
you witnessed this morning.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.180
All hoaxes.
It's not a coincidence.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.283
- We believe that someone
is intentionally dividing

12:32.285 --> 12:35.520
the city's resources
in preparation for an attack.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.090
- What are we talking about,
a bomb?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.494
- Well, we feel like we dented
this group's resources

12:42.496 --> 12:44.462
when we found their lab,
thanks to you, Lieutenant.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.765
Ultimately,
it's impossible to know

12:46.767 --> 12:48.199
what their plan
might be now.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.969
We've prepared a few
tactical scenarios.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.938
Unfortunately,
there are too many targets.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.775
So we're asking for local
first responders to help us out.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.409
Eyes and ears kinda thing.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.082
- All right, come on.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.785
Feel that dead meat!
Come on, hit it!

13:06.787 --> 13:08.019
Go! Oh!

13:08.021 --> 13:09.354
Jab, jab, right cross.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.922
There you go.
Left cross.

13:10.924 --> 13:11.956
Hit it!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.291
Break those ribs,
break those ribs.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.926
[laughter]

13:14.928 --> 13:17.162
- Uh, there's no ribs
in sirloin, Herrmann.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.364
- Body shot, go.
Uppercut.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.366
- You talk to Chief yet?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.867
- Speed bag.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.269
Come on, we're gonna lose.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.537
Come on, come on,
hit that meat.

13:25.539 --> 13:26.571
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

13:26.573 --> 13:29.107
- Who the hell
do you think you are?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.408
After everything I've done,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.177
all the times
I've stood up for you.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.312
- Brett, relax.
Just take a deep breath.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.446
- What, you have
the balls to pretend

13:35.448 --> 13:37.048
you haven't just
stabbed me in the back?

13:37.050 --> 13:39.918
Who's going around
gossiping about who here?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.386
- It has nothing to do
with talking about stuff!

13:41.388 --> 13:42.554
You bring it to work!
- Hey! Hey!

13:42.556 --> 13:45.523
- It affects me!
- Hey! What's going on?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.467
- She's the one
you're protecting?

14:08.614 --> 14:10.548
- What's up?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.250
- Message from
the alderman's office.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.118
He wants to grab dinner
to talk about options

14:14.120 --> 14:15.920
for the tornado victims.

14:15.922 --> 14:19.157
- Higher ground worked.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.859
- We'll see.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.027
[knocking on door]

14:23.029 --> 14:24.562
- Wallace.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.130
I'm sure you're here
about Jessica Chilton.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.233
- Yes, I am.

14:30.402 --> 14:31.870
- That young woman's business

14:31.872 --> 14:33.872
has monopolized
my afternoon on a day

14:33.874 --> 14:35.306
when no one has time.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.075
- Is it true?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.977
Was she removed
from Ambo 98?

14:40.479 --> 14:42.947
- There were accusations
made on both sides,

14:42.949 --> 14:45.416
so we chose to resolve
the matter quietly.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.051
- What made you think
it was okay to use my house

14:47.053 --> 14:48.052
as a dumping ground?

14:48.054 --> 14:51.422
I made the move
because 51 has a reputation

14:51.424 --> 14:54.926
and I figured that was
exactly what Jessica needed.

14:54.928 --> 15:00.632
so I could get ahead of it
before it got to this point.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.935
in a three-strike system
of your own design.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.503
Am I correct?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.438
Did you report
any of this to IAD?

15:07.440 --> 15:11.442
Or did you give her a clear
directive for staying on track?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.645
- How'd you know
about all this?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.483
- The union emailed me a list
of grievances against you.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.619
They're garbage, of course,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.589
but the union's compelled
to fight this and you,

15:24.591 --> 15:27.659
and it will be ugly.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.061
Want my advice?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.063
Give her what she wants.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.932
You need to decide
whether this other paramedic

15:33.934 --> 15:36.467
is worth
the ramifications here.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.572
- Let's go!
Work off the jab!

15:41.574 --> 15:44.442
Set up with the jab!

15:48.180 --> 15:49.213
- [groans]

15:49.215 --> 15:50.481
- You see?

15:50.483 --> 15:53.051
We gotta work on your speed!

15:53.053 --> 15:55.553
Hey, Cruz, you know
where we could get

15:55.555 --> 15:58.389
a live chicken
this time of night?

15:58.391 --> 16:01.059
- Why would you think
I would know that?

16:01.061 --> 16:04.162
[both groaning]

16:04.164 --> 16:05.697
- Did you know
he couldn't box?

16:05.699 --> 16:07.565
- Ha, it's all
in good fun, Sis.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.067
How come you're not
in his corner?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.468
- Eh, I tried to volunteer,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.471
but apparently
boxing's a man's sport.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.375
[speaking Spanish]

16:21.680 --> 16:23.414
- [speaking Spanish]

16:25.617 --> 16:27.552
[laughter]

16:27.554 --> 16:29.020
- Did I hear that right?

16:29.022 --> 16:30.521
He say you were
a Silver Gloves?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.590
- Silver, yeah.
High school.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.592
Undefeated, by the way.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.597
- What do you say?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.599
- All right, first thing is
you gotta open up, man.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.700
You're too rigid.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.701
- No, no, no, no.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.036
Hey, if he stands like that,

16:45.038 --> 16:46.537
he's gonna open himself up
to abuse.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.207
Come on, I'll show you.
Stand over here, Jimmy.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.042
All right, come on,
Powder Puff.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.610
All right, see,
you stand like this,

16:52.612 --> 16:55.246
you're less exposed, right?

16:57.149 --> 16:58.149
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh!

16:58.151 --> 17:01.319
- I'm sorry.
Herrmann, you okay?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.421
You--
- Yeah.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.623
Yeah, yeah.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.625
- You still want me
to get that chicken?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.027
[laughter]

17:09.029 --> 17:10.061
- Shut up.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.797
[laughter]

17:18.570 --> 17:21.239
- Lieutenant.

17:21.241 --> 17:25.209
Oh, thank you so much,
Mateo.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.079
Have you ever had
Dingles Bay Oysters?

17:28.081 --> 17:30.581
Tastes like the ocean.

17:30.583 --> 17:35.053
- I'm here to talk about
the tornado victims.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.487
- I know you are.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.824
Fortunately, I was able
to pull some strings,

17:39.826 --> 17:42.727
and those friends of yours,
Dawn and Lucas Hicks,

17:42.729 --> 17:46.631
we managed to get them
a handsome FEMA settlement.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.600
They're set.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.837
- That's a good start.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.806
What about the rest
of the victims?

17:57.242 --> 18:01.813
- That's a work in progress.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.082
But here's
what I'm thinking.

18:04.084 --> 18:08.319
Am I right that you have
three weeks' furlough saved up?

18:08.321 --> 18:11.756
- My wife and I are members
of the Saginaw Resort

18:11.758 --> 18:13.157
on Lake Geneva.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.260
It's a beautiful place.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.763
Take my car.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.498
Bring your girl.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.202
We'll hash it out.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.105
- Hash--

18:27.107 --> 18:28.239
- Ah, damn.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.475
- Hash what out exactly?

18:30.477 --> 18:31.509
- Sorry.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.412
Uh, they sprung
this vote on me.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.481
Uh, please, continue.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.582
Dinner's on me.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.716
- We're not done.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.118
- Absolutely not.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.820
My aid will handle
all the details.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.522
Enjoy the lake.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.133
- You okay
to be seen with me?

18:55.135 --> 18:58.636
Maybe your boss is hiding
out there in the bushes.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.508
- I'm sorry for
the cold shoulder.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.377
You can imagine the pressure
we're all under.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.446
- Of course,
I understand.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.885
- We, uh, traced the smoke
grenades and the suitcases

19:13.887 --> 19:16.654
back to a motel room
in Bronzeville.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.658
- And all we found there
were empty fast food containers

19:20.660 --> 19:24.228
and a rambling anarchist
manifesto.

19:25.797 --> 19:29.300
They're one step ahead of us,
and they're ready to act.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.402
It's just a matter of when.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.380
- What the hell is this?

19:42.382 --> 19:43.514
- A conversation.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.850
- Yeah? Well, I want
my union rep here.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.619
- Right here.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.892
- I don't know
what kinda stories

19:54.894 --> 19:58.763
- Let's get one thing straight,
no one is telling any stories,

19:58.765 --> 20:03.301
and no one is being
detailed out.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.436
Now, that's not you,

20:05.438 --> 20:07.438
and that is not Brett either.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.242
- Chief Boden and I
are unified on this.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.245
- This right here,

20:14.247 --> 20:16.714
this is where
your road splits, Chili.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.382
Now you can either
see me as the enemy

20:18.384 --> 20:20.718
or as an ally.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.453
One who's making
every effort he can

20:22.455 --> 20:26.290
to offer you
one last chance.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.361
I'm ready either way.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.847
- Mouch!

20:49.849 --> 20:52.883
Just talked to Burgess
over the 21st.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.486
What's this I hear
about the boxing match

20:55.488 --> 20:57.488
being for yours
and Platt's wedding?

20:57.490 --> 21:00.024
- Technically,
the reception's been paid for.

21:00.026 --> 21:03.394
It's more about
recouping the costs.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.629
- Uh-uh.
No way.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.930
I am not gonna
throw away 50 bucks

21:05.932 --> 21:07.498
so that you and Platt
can have your dream wedding.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.001
- Hey, nothing doing,
all right?

21:10.003 --> 21:11.402
We still need you
in the corner.

21:11.404 --> 21:15.506
- Hey, guys, there's something
going down near The Loop.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.542
- We're looking at
a lot of law enforcement

21:18.544 --> 21:20.478
on the western edge
of The Loop right now,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.314
<i>in response to reports of</i>
<i>at least four abandoned vans</i>

21:23.316 --> 21:24.982
<i>parked around</i>
<i>the Willis Tower</i>

21:24.984 --> 21:27.051
<i>that police are calling</i>
<i>suspicious.</i>

21:27.053 --> 21:29.420
<i>There's a massive evacuation</i>
<i>effort underway</i>

21:29.422 --> 21:32.056
<i>as the bomb squad begins</i>
<i>its work on those vehicles,</i>

21:32.058 --> 21:34.992
<i>which we can only assume</i>
<i>means that police suspect</i>

21:34.994 --> 21:37.762
<i>those vans are loaded with</i>
<i>some sort of explosive agents.</i>

21:37.764 --> 21:39.697
- <i>And both CPD</i>
<i>and the Fire Department</i>

21:39.699 --> 21:42.466
<i>have sent a massive amount</i>
<i>of manpower to the area</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:44.035
<i>to help with the evacuation</i>

21:44.037 --> 21:47.405
<i>of the over</i>
<i>10,000 workers and tourists</i>

21:47.407 --> 21:48.939
<i>who are in the tower.</i>

21:48.941 --> 21:50.708
- My God.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.045
<i>Box Alarm,</i>
<i>2050 Kinzie Avenue.</i>

21:54.047 --> 21:55.780
- Wait, that's not Willis Tower.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.416
- Got a whole city to serve.
Let's move it, Candidate.

22:00.085 --> 22:01.619
- Chief, 81 is in the building,

22:01.621 --> 22:03.354
<i>and we're not seeing anything.</i>

22:03.356 --> 22:04.789
<i>- No smoke. Let's go.</i>

22:04.791 --> 22:07.391
<i>- Take no chances today, 81.</i>

22:07.393 --> 22:09.960
<i>Ambo's on the way in.</i>

22:09.962 --> 22:11.395
<i>- Copy, Chief.</i>

22:11.397 --> 22:13.731
<i>Otis, Dawson, now.</i>
<i>Fan out.</i>

22:19.571 --> 22:21.439
- Casey, report.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.508
- Chief, still no sign of smoke
<i>in the building.</i>

22:24.510 --> 22:27.712
<i>Checking to see if it was</i>
<i>a faulty sensor.</i>

22:27.714 --> 22:30.448
- Have the paramedics look for
a wall-mounted defibrillator.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.949
That could have set it off.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.951
Rescue Squad,

22:33.953 --> 22:35.753
hang tight, stand by.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.722
<i>- Chief, there's</i>
<i>a security guard here.</i>
