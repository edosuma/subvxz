and that's when

17:10.030 --> 17:11.281
people say the souls switch.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.991
- Yes.
- And your soul came into me

17:13.033 --> 17:14.993
and made me, like,
a degenerate drug addict.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.703
Yeah, everyone thinks
we "Freaky Friday'd."

17:16.745 --> 17:18.371
- We "Freaky Friday'd."
- We "Freaky Friday'd."

17:18.413 --> 17:19.706
It makes a lot of sense.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.332
I don't personally believe
in the theory,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.209

and footnoted.

It doesn't even bother me
that much.

17:26.046 --> 17:30.508

you never--you never shared.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.094
You never shared the drugs.
