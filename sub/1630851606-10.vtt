[seagulls cawing]

00:15.598 --> 00:17.600
[menacing music playing]

00:18.810 --> 00:19.686
Hey, sweetie.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.646
[metal clatters to ground]

00:22.230 --> 00:23.106
It's me.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.819
I know this is impossible to you,
and I'm gonna explain--

00:29.195 --> 00:32.699
You're right. I'm sorry.
I deserve that. I do. I know I do.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.243
You have been through hell,
and that is my fault.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.953
And I'm sorry. I'm so--

00:38.538 --> 00:39.748
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.001
I can promise you
that I didn't have any other choice.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.795
I didn't.
I don't expect you to understand that now.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.382
All I can do is tell you what happened,
and I'll answer your questions.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.552
Maybe you'll see it was the only way.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.306
I know you don't believe that,
and I know it's hard to hear. But I--

00:56.389 --> 00:59.851
It was my only choice.
It was the only way to make sure that

01:01.269 --> 01:04.814
we were all safe and we were all together.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.985
[crying softly, sniffles]

01:09.069 --> 01:11.446
It was the only way to be a family again.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.365
[dramatic music playing]

01:19.079 --> 01:22.207
All I'm saying is that
there was an explosion in the shipyards.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.750
Where'd that come from, huh?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.169
I wouldn't put it past
these assholes, man.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.421
You don't know them.
They could've gotten on the ship.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.552
Listen, why not make sure?

01:34.636 --> 01:35.804
What's it gonna hurt?

01:42.560 --> 01:43.561
Hey, Mack.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.438
[on radio] Yeah?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.066
[man] I want you and the crew
to search the ship for stowaways.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.735
-Thank you.
-[Mack] Uh, okay, but why?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.613
You never know, man.
Just… just give it a once-over, will you?

01:54.155 --> 01:54.989
Copy that.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.283
[sighs] Yup.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.203
Nice work, John B. You know
these things lock from the outside, right?

02:00.286 --> 02:02.539
Okay, I was just trying
to get us on the boat, JJ.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.915
I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.917
-[JJ] We're stuck in here like rats.
-It's hot.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.295
-In this death cage!
-[Pope] Okay, JJ, you're not helping.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.172
You don't have a lot of room
to talk right now.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.092
You said you had a plan,
but what happened to thinking ahead?

02:14.175 --> 02:16.928
I find
your lack of self-knowledge disturbing.

02:17.011 --> 02:20.140
[laughs] Last I checked, you literally
shot an oil container with the gat.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.809
-Remember that?
-Oh my God! Shut up. Shut up!

02:24.060 --> 02:25.645
-Pull it together.
-[JJ and Pope sigh]

02:31.192 --> 02:33.403
-Okay.
-Let's try to find a way out of here.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.159
[Rafe grunting]

02:39.242 --> 02:40.285
Lemme see.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.498
I got this.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.002
[gasps] Wow.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.796
The family was in trouble.
We thought Dad was dead.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.673
I'm the one who stepped up, okay?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.884
-I took care of business, right?
-Mm-hmm.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.595
This thing is worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.221
Do you understand that?

03:00.305 --> 03:03.391
Honestly, I… I don't care about this.
I don't care about the money.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.309
I care about Sarah.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.187
-Is she okay? No one will tell me.
-[Rafe] We talked about-- Wheezie!

03:07.270 --> 03:10.648
Listen,
this is the Cross of Santo Domingo, okay?

03:10.732 --> 03:13.818
They say this is worth more than the gold
we got from the Royal Merchant.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.572
I got this for all of us, for our family.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.616
And don't forget that.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.496
[Ward] I used
the scuba gear on the Druthers.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.166
I had it all set up in advance,

03:29.250 --> 03:30.376
timed to the second.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.502
[explosion rumbles]

03:33.046 --> 03:34.714
It was touch and go getting off.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.175
I almost didn't make it. [chuckles]

03:42.972 --> 03:45.642
Sweetie, what I need you
to understand more than anything

03:45.725 --> 03:48.561
is that I never imagined
that you would be there.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.398
I wanted to call you immediately
to tell you that I was okay,

03:52.482 --> 03:55.068
to explain it all.
It broke my heart that I couldn't.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.153
But I had to make sure Rafe got away.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.405
[Rafe] Thank you, Dad.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.991
At least one of us is grateful.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.244
That's psychopathic, both of you.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.121
I promised Rafe that he wouldn't go
to prison for helping me.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.499
-I had to make good on that promise.
-Not that you care.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.835
Did it look like I didn't care
when I thought Dad was dead?

04:12.919 --> 04:15.421
It looked like you cared
about running off with some asshole.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.174
It looked like all you cared about
was the inheritance.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.385
Yes, you cared!
You cared! That's the point!

04:21.386 --> 04:24.889
Anybody on that dock could see
how much you cared, sweetheart.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.977
And I know you're angry right now
and rightfully so.

04:29.060 --> 04:34.190
The important thing is
that it's all behind us now. It is.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.278
We're gonna live a new life,
all of us together.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.824
Sarah, where I'm taking you,
it's paradise.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.617
It's off this place called Guadeloupe.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.912
And oh, by the way, all those A's
you got in French are about to pay off,

04:47.996 --> 04:50.039
'cause they speak French there.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.380
I want to call my friends,
and I want to call my boyfriend.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.049
Can I at least just tell them
that I'm okay?

05:00.675 --> 05:03.469
Yes, of course you can. As soon as
we get there, you can call John B.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.513
-He knows you're here, right?
-No, he doesn't.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.723
Yeah, he does.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.141
What are you talking about?

05:08.224 --> 05:10.143
When you were getting ready,
he came by the house,

05:10.226 --> 05:11.477
and Rose talked to him.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.896
You know the cross
you've all been looking for?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.606
Rafe was able to get it.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.150
[Sarah sighs]

05:17.233 --> 05:20.194
Turns out that, I guess,
historically, it belongs to the Heywards.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.529
Yeah, I know.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.158
It also turns out that
the most important thing to me is you,

05:25.241 --> 05:26.993
so I gave John B the cross

05:28.161 --> 05:28.995
for you.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.165
And John B was okay with that?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.042
[Ward] Well, um,

05:34.125 --> 05:37.003
I had just given him
a half-billion-dollar artifact,

05:37.086 --> 05:37.920
so,

05:39.380 --> 05:41.966
yeah, he seemed pretty okay.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.511
I don't know what to tell you.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.681
He's a Pogue.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.435
Rose, Wheezie, come on in.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.521
Hey.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.106
[Wheezie] Sarah. Sarah, hey.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.193
We are going
to our very own private island.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.362
Isn't that awesome?

06:03.988 --> 06:06.449
She's not feeling real well
right now, sweetheart.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.326
But she will be.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.537
We're all gonna be feeling
pretty good soon, huh?

06:20.838 --> 06:23.216
Hey, Pope, how do you kill a snake?

06:24.342 --> 06:25.385
You go for the head.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.971
Exactly. But the head,
in this instance, is the bridge.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.432
To take the bridge,
we need maximum firepower.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.060
And I happen to know
that there's an armory on this ship

06:34.143 --> 06:36.020
in case of pirate attacks.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.688
-"Pirate attacks."
-[JJ] If we take that--

06:37.772 --> 06:39.440
-I'm not just talking pistols.
-You lost me.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.235
-I'm talking knives.
-Killing everybody here is not a plan.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.903
Ah, we lost her.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.905
I'm serious. If we get to the armory,

06:45.988 --> 06:49.158
I'm talking AKs, pistols,
knives, double-barrels--

06:49.242 --> 06:50.451
-[John B] JJ!
-[JJ] What?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.953
[John B] We gotta get out of here.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.789
We can't do anything
if we're still stuck in here.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.458
[JJ] If I get enough pressure,
I can Spartan kick that thing open.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.128
-[John B] You're not kicking shit.
-[boys speaking indistinctly]

07:00.211 --> 07:01.671
[Pope] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

07:01.754 --> 07:02.630
Guys.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.799
-[JJ] Then what do you got, Einstein?
-[Kie] Guys!

07:04.882 --> 07:06.676
-Just relax.
-Hey.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.761
She's got something. Quiet.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.555
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Just move with her.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.979
-Can we fit though that, yeah?
-Hell yeah. Nice one, Kie.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.856
What was that about a Swiss Army knife
not coming in handy?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.108
-Just stop it.
-[Pope] Go.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.945
[Cleo] Ah, shit!

07:26.028 --> 07:28.072
-Ah, piece of shit thing, man!
-[Mack whistles]

07:28.156 --> 07:30.032
-Hey!
-[Cleo] What, man?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.453
-You haven't seen any stowaways, have you?
-[Cleo] Stowaways? Ha!

07:33.536 --> 07:37.165
I got a cracked oil pan
on a piece of shit engine.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.960
If I don't keep feeding this thing
like a baby, she's gonna blow.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.713
-All right, keep an eye out for me!
-[Cleo] Whatever!

07:43.796 --> 07:46.048
Shit! Raashole thing, man!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.054
Do you guys wanna play War?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.557
-You brought cards?
-[Wheezie] Mm-hmm.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.477
-Yeah.
-I'll go grab them.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.028
[dramatic music playing]

08:14.744 --> 08:15.745
[Sarah] Oh God.

08:20.791 --> 08:21.626
[gasps]

08:21.709 --> 08:24.670
[Rose] Oh, Sarah.
Hey. Hey, what's wrong, sweetie?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.964
[sighs] I just think I'm gonna be seasick.

08:27.048 --> 08:27.882
Oh.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.800
Here.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.553
I have just the thing.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.055
Meds?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.141
Sarah, seriously,
that was for your own good,

08:37.225 --> 08:38.809
and you know it killed me to do that.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
I was just gonna ask for nondrowsy.

08:40.853 --> 08:46.150
[scoffs] We're all together.
Just chill, Sarah. This is a good thing.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.362
Where was it?
I know it's in here somewhere.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.907
Ugh. I have just the thing. I just saw it.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.581
[man speaking indistinctly]

09:20.101 --> 09:23.396
[jarring music plays]

09:31.571 --> 09:32.405
Shit.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.538
[man] This one.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.582
No, no, no. We're on track.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.166
Yeah.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.796
Well, they just put in brand-new gauges.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.762
[continues speaking indistinctly]

10:08.733 --> 10:11.611
-Oh, okay, sure. Yeah, I got it.
-[metal clanging]

10:13.112 --> 10:13.946
What the hell?

10:17.366 --> 10:18.242
Hold on a second.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.953
What kinda shit is this?

10:21.912 --> 10:24.457
[suspenseful music playing]

10:35.843 --> 10:36.969
[dialing]

10:38.137 --> 10:39.972
-[woman on radio] Dispatch 60290.
-Hello?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.183
-[woman] What is your emergency?
-Hello?

10:42.266 --> 10:45.561
Hello? My name… my name is Sarah.
I'm on a boat called the Coastal Venture.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.480
-I… I've been kidnapped. I need--
-[shushes]

10:47.563 --> 10:49.607
-[woman] Can you repeat that, please?
-Hey! [shushes]

10:50.149 --> 10:51.317
[woman] What is your location?

10:51.400 --> 10:55.404
Yeah, that's just my teenage daughter
playing pranks again. Yeah. Sorry.

10:56.155 --> 10:56.989
[grunts]

10:57.865 --> 10:58.991
You're in deep shit, kid.

11:01.827 --> 11:02.662
[grunts]

11:02.745 --> 11:07.249
Okay, we raid the armory, get weapons,
roll back here, and plot the next move.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.003
The armory is on the third deck,
aft, near the laundry room. Let's roll.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.297
[Pope] Hold up. I don't think
we should all go out there.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.465
-It's too risky.
-[JJ] Why?

11:14.548 --> 11:16.717
-I think you should stay here.
-[JJ] What?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.512
I have Sarah that I'm gonna go after.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.013
-And Pope has…
-The cross.

11:21.097 --> 11:21.972
Yeah. Let's go get it.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.474
[John B] Also, if you go out there,

11:23.557 --> 11:26.268
there's 100% probability
that you're gonna do something stupid.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.106
Okay, first of all, I think the correct
terminology is "ballsy." That is it.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.274
-[Pope] Okay, get down here.
-No. Get off!

11:32.358 --> 11:33.609
I'm a field player.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.529
[shushes] If we go out there,
and we get in a bind,

11:36.612 --> 11:39.156
we need somebody to look out for us.
That's what we need.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.535
Okay. I get it.
I get it. I get it. I'll be on the B team.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.329
-I never said "B team."
-Sorry. Are you calling me "B team"?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.206
-[Pope] Hey, JJ--
-Didn't mean to offend you.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.751
Did B team not just find our way out,
or am I totally tripping?

11:50.835 --> 11:54.338
-[Pope] Hang back. Hold down the fort.
-Great. Looking forward to it. Mm-hmm.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.256
I'll babysit.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.843
[JJ] You guys have fun. It's your funeral,
your game. I'll be in here, on the bench…

11:58.926 --> 12:00.219
-Hey.
-…chilling.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.557
Don't get shot.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.977
-That's all I got.
-[John B] Um, "Don't get shot."

12:08.060 --> 12:10.479
Well, that's disheartening and scary.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.607
-[John B] Positive affirmations, Kie.
-Yep. No problem.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.567
[John B] Three.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.777
[suspenseful music playing]

12:22.366 --> 12:23.367
Okay, let's go.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.702
Pope, grab my feet.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.871
-Pope, grab my feet!
-Oh! Jesus!

12:30.082 --> 12:30.916
[grunts]

12:31.041 --> 12:34.754
[man 1] All right, that's good.
Section B. All right.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.424
[man 2] The other side. Perfect!

12:40.301 --> 12:41.218
[man 1] One more!

12:42.303 --> 12:43.512
Hey, come on.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.766
[man 2] All right, all right.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.980
[sighs]

12:54.148 --> 12:55.524
It's just me and you.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.570
This is getting to be
a lot more than I signed up for.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.031
[sighs] I'm gonna need double

13:02.114 --> 13:04.158
if you want my men
to put themselves at risk.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.161
You want me-- Look, I'll pay you triple
if you get us there safe.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.704
All right? Are we done here?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.289
What the hell you got in that hull?

13:10.372 --> 13:13.334
It's nothing. I told you it's an antique,
a relic, just a religious--

13:13.417 --> 13:16.253
Whatever the hell it is,
it seems to attract a lot of attention.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.630
I don't like attention.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.715
My men are scared. They think it's cursed.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.217
[Ward] It's junk from a church!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.427
And you need
to control your damn daughter.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.264
-You need to not talk about my daughter.
-Relax.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.558
Out on shore,
I don't give a shit what happens,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.936
but on here, I don't want any trouble.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.730
I'll take care of my daughter.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.731
Hmm.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.654
[suspenseful music playing]

13:42.571 --> 13:44.240
[John B] Come on, Pope. Let's go.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.918
[John B] Hey, this way.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.379
Watch my six.

13:59.046 --> 13:59.880
You're good.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.885
[men speaking indistinctly]

14:04.969 --> 14:06.929
[man 1] Hey, we dealing you in?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.014
Let's go.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.602
[man 2] Yeah, it's all good.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.981
[whispers] Hey, no. No.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.567
Can't. They'll see me.

14:21.777 --> 14:25.030
[man 2] Yo, man, I gotta hit the head.
Might be a while.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.532
[man 1] Have fun with that!

14:39.920 --> 14:40.838
[man 2] Yo!

14:42.172 --> 14:45.801
-Uh, some… someone's in here.
-Well, hurry up, man. I gotta go.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.773
-[man 2] Yo! Hurry up, bro!
-Uh…

14:59.857 --> 15:03.694
Hey, I wouldn't come in here right now.
I mean, it's bad. I blew it up, man.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.614
You're not doing anything
that I'm not about to do. Just hurry up.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.531
All right! All right!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.950
Hey, all yours, bro. All yours.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.828
Lucky I gotta take a shit.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.413
[pistons pumping]

15:21.420 --> 15:23.213
[whispers] John B, are you in here?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.467
[Cleo grunts] This damn ship is too old.

15:26.550 --> 15:30.387
[pants] Hey. Can you pass me that wrench?

15:31.430 --> 15:34.141
-It's right next to you.
-Uh, sure. No… no problem.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.643
There you go.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.311
Thanks, man.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.981
This thing, I don't know
how much longer I can keep her stable.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.691
I should go talk to the captain.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.277
Can you stay here
and just keep feeding this thing?

15:45.361 --> 15:50.157
Uh… uh, actually, I got a project upstairs
I'm working on, so I can't do that now.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.742
It's only gonna take a minute.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.329
I can't do it. Sorry.
You gonna have to find someone else.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.039
Wait a second.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.125
Who are you?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.836
I'm a worker on the ship just like you.
I work here.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.381
What's your name?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.009
Uh… Pipe.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.262
Gray Pipe. Pipe Gray. They call me Pipe.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.974
Mm-hmm. What are you doing down here?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.352
Uh… I don't tell you how to do your job.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.895
-[grunting]
-[Cleo] Macias!

16:19.979 --> 16:22.398
I got one. I got a stowaway.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.566
-[Pope] Hey. Could you-- Drop it!
-[Cleo] No!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.694
-[Pope] Drop it!
-[Cleo] Screw you!

16:26.777 --> 16:29.113
Drop it. Drop it.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.156
-[Cleo screams]
-Now. Let go.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.826
Okay. Stop it. Ah!

16:35.577 --> 16:36.537
[Cleo groans]

16:39.581 --> 16:43.877
You almost broke it, man.
That hurt. Look at it, man.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.088
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna do that,
but you left me--

16:46.171 --> 16:49.842
-[grunts] Oh!
-[Cleo] Macias! A stowaway! I got one!

16:49.925 --> 16:53.721
-[men speaking indistinctly]
-[reggae music playing on radio]

17:17.911 --> 17:19.413
[alarm blaring]

17:20.372 --> 17:21.498
[man 1] Yo!

17:23.959 --> 17:24.793
Again?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.545
Aw, man!

17:27.129 --> 17:28.505
Shitty-ass cooks.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.676
Shit, man!

17:33.135 --> 17:34.553
[man 2] That was like the second--

17:34.636 --> 17:37.264
[man 1] Yo!
Why is nobody watching this food?

17:37.347 --> 17:38.640
[man 2] I'm watching my drink.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.977
-[man 1] You don't hear the fire alarm?
-[man 2] Why don't you deal with it?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.813
Drinking, not worrying
about the food that's on the stove?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.983
[man 2] You're standing right there.
You deal with it. Shut that thing up.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.569
[man 3] All right. Go on with your work.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.329
Holy shit!

18:06.210 --> 18:07.669
Pistols. Even better.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.379
[man 1] Hey! [grunting]

18:10.172 --> 18:12.299
[John B] Whoa! What? [grunting]

18:13.258 --> 18:14.218
[panting]

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
Shit.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.312
[John B screams, panting]

18:25.395 --> 18:26.814
[man 1 coughing]

18:27.606 --> 18:31.652
-Somebody! We got stowaways down here!
-[Pope] Hey, could you please stop? Hey!

18:31.735 --> 18:33.445
[Cleo grunting]

18:34.696 --> 18:37.574
-[Pope grunting]
-I'm done playing games, man.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.328
-Talk.
-Okay. Okay.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.997
-I am a stowaway on this ship, but--
-[Cleo grunts]

18:44.957 --> 18:47.835
I'm here because they took something
that belongs to me,

18:47.918 --> 18:49.002
and I'm here to get it back.

18:49.086 --> 18:49.920
What?

18:52.506 --> 18:55.884
It's an eight-foot gold cross,
and it's mine. It's my family's.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.847
And… and my best friend's girlfriend
is being held hostage on this ship.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.015
-We're here to save her.
-I don't believe you.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.727
Her name is Sarah Cameron,
Sarah Cameron, and his name is John B.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.063
Who?

19:09.523 --> 19:10.357
John B.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.446
If I find out you're lying,

19:17.406 --> 19:18.240
I kill you.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.535
[alarm blaring]

19:21.618 --> 19:23.954
-[coughs]
-[reggae music playing on radio]

19:25.455 --> 19:29.543
[scoffs] You're supposed
to turn the nozzle away from you.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.711
[laughing]

19:31.420 --> 19:32.754
Yo, there's someone on the boat.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.215
Caught him in the armory
trying to steal weapons.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.968
Search every inch of the boat
till we find him.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.720
[man 1] All right, let's do this.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.476
[man 2] Yeah, TJ said he saw somebody.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.563
[man 1] All right, let's get this place
searched. Start on the port side.

19:49.646 --> 19:50.606
[man 2] You got it.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.691
-[Ward] Come back!
-[Sarah] No!

19:52.774 --> 19:55.485
-[Ward] You want them to take you?
-[Sarah] I didn't ask to be here.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.280
[Ward] You're here, and you're
staying here. You're my daughter!

19:58.363 --> 20:00.866
-[Sarah] Don't touch me!
-You want me to carry you?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.367
[suspenseful music playing]

20:06.538 --> 20:08.248
-Hey. [shushes]
-Christ. What are you doing?

20:08.332 --> 20:10.250
-It's me.
-Jesus, you scared me.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.046
-I brought a friend.
-Cheese on bread.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.424
-Cleo?
-[Cleo] So it is you.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.134
What the hell? What are you doing here?

20:19.218 --> 20:22.304
What are you doing here?
I work here. This is my boat.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.265
It got too hot in Nassau
because of you and Sarah. I had to run.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.226
-It's not safe out here. We gotta go.
-Come on.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.394
[JJ] I've been thinking.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.439
When all this is over,
and we're just rolling in the dough,

20:33.565 --> 20:36.068
I'm gonna get a new board.
I'm gonna deck it out,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.111
and I'm gonna go on a surf trip.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.198
I don't know where,
but, like, the world's calling.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.743
-I don't know. Name a place.
-[sighs] Spain.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.996
Then after Spain,
South America or South Africa.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.332
-[Kie] You'll go to South Africa?
-One of the South places.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.085
Then Micronesia maybe,
and then… and just ride.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.130
Wherever the wave takes you, you know?

20:57.214 --> 21:00.300
So that's the plan
if we were to get a ton of cash?

21:01.802 --> 21:04.221
That's the dream? Surf trip?

21:04.304 --> 21:05.889
[JJ] Ripping jungle break all day long.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.268
Bamboo hut, cooking a fish on a fire,

21:09.351 --> 21:13.772
and after that, you go back out
and just hit the waves again.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.859
-That's the dream.
-Sounds perfect.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.486
Yeah.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.405
Got room for one more?

21:21.488 --> 21:22.364
[laughs]

21:24.616 --> 21:26.576
-You got your passport?
-You don't have a passport.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.288
Hell no, I don't got a passport.
Kookiest thing ever.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.082
-You don't need--
-[Pope whispering] Hey. Hey. Open it.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.583
Okay.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.005
-Here.
-[Pope] Thank God.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.923
-[Kie] You need help?
-I'm good.

21:40.007 --> 21:44.303
-I thought Rafe got you guys for sure.
-No. We're chill. [pants]

21:44.886 --> 21:47.389
[Kie] All right.
Okay, let's put the grate back on.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.641
-No, wait. Hold it.
-What? No. Put it back.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.397
Jesus Christ! I kill you, John B!

21:55.480 --> 21:56.815
Who is this?

21:56.898 --> 21:59.526
Just relax. Just relax, okay?
I told you I had a surprise.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.612
-Who is she? What's going on? John B!
-[John B] Hey, hey. Kie, relax. Relax.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.574
Remember I told you about the girl
we met in the Bahamas that saved us?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.576
Uh… Cleo, yeah?

22:08.744 --> 22:09.578
Cleo.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.497
-She's gonna help us, all right?
-Next time, ask me.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.962
We searched below three times,
stem to stern. Nothing.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.844
Search the containers.
That's where they'll be.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.055
Yes, sir.

22:29.598 --> 22:34.102
[scoffs] You seriously didn't grab
nothing, not one single gun?

22:34.186 --> 22:38.106
-We tr… we tried, okay? I got attacked.
-This is why I should've gone with.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.110
Let me get this straight.
You four, with no weapons,

22:42.194 --> 22:46.406
decided you were gonna hijack
this tramp steamer on your own?

22:46.490 --> 22:48.617
Do you have any idea who these people are?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.453
Eberhimi, if he catch you,
he's gonna kill you.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.454
Dead.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.499
Cut off your fingers.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.417
Okay.
What about waiting until we get to port?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.920
At least then, if something goes wrong,
we have a place to run.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.880
-No. No, we can't do that.
-Why?

23:01.963 --> 23:05.092
Because I've run the scenario
over 1,000 times in my head,

23:05.175 --> 23:08.637
and our best chances are on this ship.
There's 15 crew members and five of us.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.055
-[Kie] Exactly.
-Three-to-one odds.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.474
Best it'll get. We wait
till we get there, they'll trap us.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.143
-[Kie] We have no chance.
-[John B] No, Kie, there's something else.

23:16.895 --> 23:17.729
Ward's alive.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.400
He's alive, and he's on this boat.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.651
-What?
-[John B] Yeah.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.736
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Are you serious?

23:24.820 --> 23:28.907
It was all a setup, blowing up the boat,
the confession to Shoupe.

23:28.990 --> 23:29.950
Think about it.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.160
That was to clear Rafe's name.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.705
And he does what? Goes to the Druthers.
And what's on the Druthers?

23:35.789 --> 23:37.541
-Scuba.
-[John B] Bingo.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.042
[JJ] So, Ward's alive, huh?

23:39.126 --> 23:40.335
And he has the gold

23:41.294 --> 23:42.421
and the cross

23:43.630 --> 23:44.464
and Sarah.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.715
Thanks for rubbing that in.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.385
[JJ] So he's just gonna get away
with everything again, huh?

23:49.177 --> 23:50.053
Not happening.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.931
We're not watching this movie again,
right, Pope?

23:53.014 --> 23:54.933
You said we need the win.

23:55.517 --> 23:59.438
And with her, we're going to the bridge,
and we're gonna take it right now.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.273
-You with me?
-Let's do it.

24:01.356 --> 24:04.067
I'm with you, and I wanna be
the one to take that bridge.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.611
-[JJ] That's what I'm talking about.
-[Cleo chuckling]

24:06.695 --> 24:08.613
-He's gonna take the bridge?
-Yeah.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.865
He couldn't even take me.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.950
-First of all, I was going easy on you.
-Seriously?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.161
-I went easy on you.
-[shushes]

24:14.244 --> 24:15.745
-Shut up.
-She didn't even--

24:15.829 --> 24:17.706
[John B] Relax, all of you.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.042
If you're really with us, if we use
that knife, we can go up into the bridge,

24:21.126 --> 24:23.837
hold it up against the captain's neck,
then we go on the intercom

24:23.920 --> 24:27.007
and make him tell the rest of the crew
to meet up in the forward hull.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.967
Once they're in the same place,

24:29.050 --> 24:32.637
bam, we lock them in there,
and we take back what's ours.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.432
I like it. It could work.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.641
Are you with us, then?

24:37.976 --> 24:38.810
No.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.645
This is stupid.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.481
[man] All right,
let's open these things up!

24:43.482 --> 24:45.817
-[Kie] They're checking the containers.
-[Pope] Uh-oh.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.862
-Wait. No. Cleo.
-[Kie] What are you doing?

24:48.945 --> 24:50.322
[shushes]

24:51.740 --> 24:54.034
[suspenseful music playing]

24:55.076 --> 24:56.661
[Macias] Piece of shit's stuck.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.663
Macias!

24:59.164 --> 25:00.874
She's gonna tell them. Shit!

25:00.957 --> 25:01.958
[Cleo] Hold up!

25:02.542 --> 25:04.002
This one's clear, sir.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.757
-Are you sure?
-[Cleo] Went through it inch by inch.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.009
Nothing but tubing and plastics in there.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.680
-What if the stowaway had been in there?
-Well, he wasn't, so…

25:16.515 --> 25:18.183
Come on, man. We have work to do.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.809
Move your bumper, man.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.526
Okay, she's on our side. That's good.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.529
[JJ] Pope, you're up.
We'll wait for your signal, okay?

25:30.612 --> 25:31.446
[Cleo whistles]

25:33.448 --> 25:34.616
Come on.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.118
-Thanks for that, by the way.
-Yeah.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.040
Look, I don't know why you did that,
but I'm not gonna argue.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.751
-Why'd you do that?
-Not for charity.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.504
Just figure I'm better off
with you guys than with Eberhimi.

25:47.587 --> 25:48.547
Right.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.049
And now you guys owe me
a cut of that treasure.

25:51.132 --> 25:51.967
That's fair.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.678
All right.
How we take over this fort, chief?

25:54.761 --> 25:56.263
-[men yelling indistinctly]
-[Pope] Um…

25:57.722 --> 25:58.890
Can I borrow your knife?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.811
I got a better idea. Come on.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.187
[dramatic music playing]

26:11.027 --> 26:13.154
Hey. Put your hands behind your back.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.155
Follow my lead.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.033
-Okay.
-Trust me?

26:18.285 --> 26:19.119
Okay.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.832
Hey, Eberhimi, I got one.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.125
I got a stowaway.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.836
You picked the wrong boat.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.631
I wanna talk about
what you're doing here

26:32.966 --> 26:34.593
before I throw you overboard.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.303
-Go.
-[Pope grunts]

26:36.386 --> 26:37.596
[both grunting]

26:41.683 --> 26:42.851
[man] The hell is going on?

26:42.934 --> 26:44.644
[all grunting]

26:46.187 --> 26:48.398
-[Cleo] Stop!
-Come on. Let's tie them up.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.649
[Cleo] On the ground.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.986
-Stop it!
-[Sarah] Get off of me!

26:53.069 --> 26:55.864
-[Ward] Damn it, Sarah!
-[Sarah] Can you at least take these off?

26:55.947 --> 26:57.157
No. I wanted to trust you,

26:57.240 --> 26:59.284
but I can't trust you,
so now I gotta do this.

26:59.367 --> 27:02.120
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not. I didn't wanna put them on you.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.039
You think I wanted any of this to happen?

27:04.122 --> 27:07.000
I did not. Okay?
I wanted to be able to trust my daughter.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.711
Clearly, I can't.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.130
You are such a liar.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.632
-All right.
-I saw the cross.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.468
The whole speech you gave me
about trading it.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.095
I knew you never traded it.
Do you ever tell the truth?

27:19.179 --> 27:21.765
You never lie, is that it?
How's that seasickness? Feeling better?

27:21.848 --> 27:24.059
-[Sarah] I'm being kidnapped.
-You're not being kidnapped!

27:24.142 --> 27:26.728
I'm your father! You're 16 years old!

27:26.811 --> 27:29.064
I can take you
anywhere in the world I want to,

27:29.147 --> 27:30.357
and that is what I am doing!

27:30.440 --> 27:32.567
-Because you can't make good decisions…
-Don't touch me.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.027
…I will make them for you.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.239
Decision one,
you will not see John B again ever.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.369
You are coming to stay with us for good.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.622
And one day, you will see.
One day, you will grow up,

27:45.705 --> 27:47.832
and you'll see
that I'm doing this for you.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.252
No, you're not.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.840
Everything you do is for yourself.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.300
You are greedy.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.428
-Watch your mouth.
-You are selfish. You are manipulative.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.971
-You are a liar.
-I am your father.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.598
And you are a murderer.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.517
[Ward grunts, panting]

28:08.061 --> 28:10.855
-I'm sorry. Sweetie, I'm sorry.
-Get off of me.

28:12.774 --> 28:13.608
Goddamn it!

28:13.692 --> 28:14.818
No! No! No!

28:15.902 --> 28:16.736
[groaning]

28:21.116 --> 28:25.829
-[yells] Sarah! Sarah! No!
-[Sarah grunting]

28:27.914 --> 28:30.291
-[Ward] Sarah! Honey, please!
-[banging on door]

28:30.959 --> 28:31.918
Honey!

28:33.461 --> 28:35.588
Sarah!

28:37.841 --> 28:39.092
Open the door!

28:40.009 --> 28:43.471
-She's never gonna be on our side, Rose!
-[Rose] Rafe.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.181
She's…

28:46.391 --> 28:47.225
[grunts]

28:48.935 --> 28:51.438
[sighs] She thinks
she's a Pogue now, right?

28:51.521 --> 28:54.399
Just… transformation is complete, okay?

28:54.482 --> 28:58.278
So as long as she knows where we are,
we are never gonna be safe.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.450
When you think logically
about what we need to do to contain her--

29:03.533 --> 29:05.910
[Eberhimi over PA]
Attention, all passengers and crew.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.163
Report to the tween forward hull.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.665
-[Eberhimi grunts]
-"It's an order." Order them.

29:12.625 --> 29:17.756
Attention, all passengers, all crew,
report to the tween forward hull.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.466
That's an order.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.218
Repeat. All hands
and all passengers report

29:22.302 --> 29:24.512
to the tween forward hull immediately.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.307
-[John B] They took the bridge.
-That's our boy.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.602
Once they're all in the hull,
Kie and I will lock them inside.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.687
-Come on. You too. Let's go.
-[man] What's going on?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.689
[John B] I'll find Sarah
and get the lifeboat.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.900
[Kie] We'll meet you,
load the cross and get outta here.

29:36.983 --> 29:37.817
[JJ] Let's roll.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.613
[suspenseful music playing]

29:48.453 --> 29:49.412
[Kie grunts]

29:51.790 --> 29:54.042
[man 1] Hey,
what the hell is this all about?

29:54.125 --> 29:56.961
[man 2] This doesn't have anything to do
with that stowaway, does it?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.129
Guess we'll find out.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.173
Psst. How many?

30:00.256 --> 30:02.258
[man 1] It's got something
to do with that cross.

30:02.342 --> 30:05.011
I'm telling you, it's cursed.
We're making God angry.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.599
-Where's cap? Didn't he call us down here?
-Yeah.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.810
-What's going on?
-Waiting for the captain.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.645
[man 1] He's supposed to be down here.

30:14.687 --> 30:17.899
-Where are we going, and where's Dad?
-[Rose] I don't know, Wheezie.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.110
[men speaking indistinctly]

30:22.779 --> 30:24.155
[jarring music playing]

30:30.912 --> 30:32.497
[Wheezie] What's happening? Where's Rafe?

30:32.580 --> 30:34.290
-I don't know.
-[man 1] What's going on?

30:37.502 --> 30:38.878
[men speaking indistinctly]

30:45.468 --> 30:46.719
[man 2] Hurry it up!

30:46.845 --> 30:47.887
[metal clanging]

30:55.603 --> 30:58.314
[Cleo] Tell them to stay there
until further notice.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.235
[Eberhimi and Pope grunting]

31:11.703 --> 31:12.579
Let's go.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.874
Tie his legs. [panting] You don't move.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.586
I'm going to the crane. Meet me there.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.090
That's all of the crew.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.885
Except Ward. We need Ward.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.219
We can't wait.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.766
[suspenseful music playing]

31:35.393 --> 31:37.353
-[man] Hey! Shit!
-[men grunting]

31:37.437 --> 31:40.231

31:40.815 --> 31:41.774
Oh my God! Oh my God!

31:41.858 --> 31:43.151
[JJ] Close it! Close it!

31:43.818 --> 31:44.903
[man] I'm trying!

31:45.528 --> 31:47.322
Lock it. [grunts]

31:48.156 --> 31:49.782
Check the other door!

31:49.866 --> 31:51.743
-What's going on?
-[man] Go! Move!

31:52.327 --> 31:54.203
There's another door!
There's another door!

31:54.287 --> 31:55.622
Come on! Go! Go!

31:59.918 --> 32:01.836
-[JJ groaning]
-[men grunting]

32:08.676 --> 32:10.261
[man 1] Hey! We're in here!

32:10.762 --> 32:13.306
-[man 2] Yo! Hey!
-[man 3] Hey! Let us out!

32:16.851 --> 32:18.102
-[groans]
-[Cleo] Bastard.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.856
I should've known never to hire you.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.360
Yeah, well, no refunds.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.029
[suspenseful music playing]

32:28.112 --> 32:30.073
[engine whirring off]

32:32.784 --> 32:33.785
Sarah!

32:37.622 --> 32:40.541
Open up! Sarah! Sarah.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.671
Sarah! [grunts]

32:47.215 --> 32:49.258
-Come and get this one.
-[Kie] Yep.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.638
Here she is.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.061
Surf trip. [chuckles]

33:01.187 --> 33:02.689
[locks clicking]

33:07.068 --> 33:08.069
[laughs]

33:08.987 --> 33:10.947
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

33:11.030 --> 33:13.992
-That's what I'm talking about! Let's go!
-[Kie laughs]

33:14.617 --> 33:18.913
The time where people do shit to us
and we just sit back and take it is over.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.415
[JJ] Whoo! That's my boy!

33:20.498 --> 33:22.500
-Let's get this done, baby!
-Hell yeah!

33:22.583 --> 33:23.459
[JJ] Whoo!

33:25.336 --> 33:26.796
[dramatic music playing]

33:26.879 --> 33:28.297
[Kie] Here, just tie it up.

33:35.596 --> 33:36.639
[pistons pumping]

33:36.723 --> 33:37.849
Sarah!

33:49.318 --> 33:51.654
-[jarring music plays]
-[gasps] Rafe.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.822
Watch your head, man.

33:52.905 --> 33:56.743
-What the hell are you doing here, John B?
-Just put that thing down, all right?

33:56.826 --> 33:57.994
Why would I do that? Huh?

33:58.077 --> 33:59.954
This isn't about you, all right?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.956
-It's not about me?
-[John B] No.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.417
This is about Sarah, okay?

34:05.084 --> 34:06.377
I don't know. I think it is.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.464
[both grunting]

34:16.345 --> 34:17.722
All right, let's go home.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.682
I'm coming, John B.

34:25.354 --> 34:27.106
[grunting]

34:40.119 --> 34:42.538
-[Rafe] Same old shit.
-You don't have to do this, all right?

34:42.622 --> 34:45.124
Pogues stealing from us.
You know, I can't…

34:46.709 --> 34:48.252
I'm not gonna let that happen.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.254

[Rafe] Hey! Come here!

[steam hissing]

34:58.846 --> 35:00.139
Where are you going, huh?

35:03.392 --> 35:04.644
[Rafe groaning]

35:24.122 --> 35:27.834
[Pope] Okay. On? No. On. On.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.671
-[power whirring on]
-It's on! It's on! Okay. [exhales deeply]

35:38.386 --> 35:40.805
-[Ward] Hello! Open the door!
-[banging on door]

35:40.888 --> 35:42.181
Somebody!

35:52.108 --> 35:54.193
-Take her up, Pope.
-Okay.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.196
Okay, okay. And up we go.

-Wait right here. I'll be right back.
-Mm-hmm.

48:43.670 --> 48:44.504
[Rafe] Let me…

48:45.839 --> 48:46.798
Let me talk to him.

49:02.814 --> 49:03.649
Hey, Dad.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.776
Hey.

49:06.902 --> 49:07.736
[Ward groans]

49:08.236 --> 49:10.864
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be good, all right?

49:11.990 --> 49:12.866
We did it.

49:13.825 --> 49:15.202
All this, it's over.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.412
All right? It all worked out.

49:19.164 --> 49:21.583
I got the cross. We got the gold.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.252
We got everything.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.591
We're done. We're done. I got everything.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.053
[somber music playing]

49:48.819 --> 49:49.778
We'll find her.

49:51.279 --> 49:53.615
I'll bring her back for this family.
I promise.

49:57.244 --> 49:58.829
For our family, Dad.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.665
It'll be just like you wanted.

50:03.583 --> 50:05.669
But listen, while you're down,
I'm gonna step up.

50:07.796 --> 50:08.630
Okay? I'm…

50:11.383 --> 50:12.801
I'm gonna be a better man…

50:16.596 --> 50:17.764
just like you.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.480
-[sighs]
-[Rafe] Okay? Just like you.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.067
[JJ] Come on.

50:31.737 --> 50:32.696
[John B] Come on, boys.

50:32.779 --> 50:35.407
-[grunts] That's good.
-[Sarah] Good job, guys.

50:35.490 --> 50:36.783
-[Kie] Good job.
-[JJ] Whoa.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.328
-[John B] JJ, you all right there, buddy?
-Yeah. Still a little dizzy.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.915
Okay, anybody know where we're at?

50:43.999 --> 50:45.876
Deserted beach. Unknown island.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.503
All right, I'll take that as a no.

50:50.922 --> 50:52.340
Plan A, huh, Pope?

50:52.424 --> 50:53.633
That went well.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.427
This is the lowest we can go.

50:58.430 --> 51:01.600
We literally have nothing else to lose.
The cross, gone.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.560
The gold, gone.

51:04.186 --> 51:07.147
[JJ] Seriously, if we had a nickel
for every time we got beat up,

51:07.230 --> 51:08.940
I'd say we're at a dollar fifty.

51:09.566 --> 51:10.984
[Kie] That's more than I got on me.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.195
[Sarah] That somehow
doesn't make me feel better.

51:13.278 --> 51:15.238
[John B] Yeah, you're right.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.282
But, I mean, we've…

51:19.159 --> 51:22.579
-We've had some good stuff happen, right?
-[Pope] Name something.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.122
[John B] Um…

51:25.665 --> 51:26.833
Uh, the boiler room.

51:29.127 --> 51:32.172
What? If the boiler didn't explode,
I wouldn't have gotten away from Rafe.

51:32.255 --> 51:34.549
I couldn't have gotten the Zodiac
and gotten us out of here.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.134
That wasn't luck.

51:36.218 --> 51:39.221
That thing was gonna blow
the second I stopped feeding it.

51:39.304 --> 51:41.681
-[John B] Stealing my thunder, Cleo. Um…
-[Cleo] Sorry.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.016
Okay. Pope,

51:44.267 --> 51:45.894
you're related to Denmark Tanny.

51:46.728 --> 51:49.356
-That's crazy.
-And I lost all his inheritance.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.608
[John B] You know what?

51:52.984 --> 51:55.570
Guys, this is it. This is the Pogue life.

51:55.654 --> 51:58.949
We are in the Caribbean.
It's our own little slice of paradise.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.701
With my best friends, with my family.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.998
I don't know.
I wouldn't wanna do it with anyone else.

52:09.501 --> 52:13.797
Look, and while you guys were complaining
about every little thing…

52:14.881 --> 52:16.424
-JJ?
-Hmm?

52:17.968 --> 52:20.011
I was looking at those burly lefts.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.681
["Legalize"
by Black River Assembly playing]

52:23.306 --> 52:25.517
-There's some slabs out there.
-Just a few.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.979
[John B] Kie, see that?
I know you wanna get out.

52:29.062 --> 52:29.896
No boards.

52:29.980 --> 52:33.483
Well, we can bodysurf
till we make some boards.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.861
-[Kie] Lame.
-Pope? Come on, man.

52:36.403 --> 52:38.613
-They do look pretty tasty.
-[John B] Oh, yes, they do.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.867
[Pope] There's nobody around.
We could squat here for a bit.

52:42.701 --> 52:45.620
-Kind of belongs to us now, huh?
-You got a point.

52:45.704 --> 52:46.705
Six-way split?

52:47.205 --> 52:49.124
-[JJ in posh accent] Poguelandia.
-Oh boy.

52:49.207 --> 52:52.377
I claim thee Poguelandia.
[in normal voice] I like the ring of it.

52:52.460 --> 52:55.213
I'm gonna make a flag.
It's gonna have a chicken on it.

52:55.297 --> 52:58.091
-With a coconut bra, smoking a J…
-[Sarah and Kie laugh]

52:58.175 --> 52:59.843
-…in Crocs.
-[laughs]

52:59.926 --> 53:01.720
-[Kie] I could use a J.
-[Sarah] Can we vote?

53:01.803 --> 53:03.680
-Shall we get to work?
-Let's get to work.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.473
Let's start working on provisions.

53:05.557 --> 53:06.391
Set up shop.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.187
Sarah.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.398
Till death do us part?

53:14.441 --> 53:15.692
Till death do us part.

53:16.860 --> 53:19.237
-Welcome back to the Pogue life.
-Full Pogue.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.114
Full Pogue. Ooh.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.618
-Welcome to the Pogues.
-Thanks.

53:24.701 --> 53:27.204
-Going full Pogue.
-[Cleo] What is a Pogue, anyway?

53:27.287 --> 53:30.373
-What is that handshake you do?
-Going full Pogue. Okay, I think I--

53:30.457 --> 53:33.168
-[Cleo] Slap, slap. Hey!
-[Pope] Slap, slap. Hey!

53:33.251 --> 53:34.586
[John B] We should talk about it.

53:34.669 --> 53:37.172
-[JJ] I just want water.
-[group speaking indistinctly]

53:37.255 --> 53:39.925
[John B] My dad had
this quote from Euripides.

53:41.927 --> 53:45.639
"The ocean washes away
all the evil men do."

53:45.722 --> 53:47.724
[somber music playing]

53:51.436 --> 53:53.021
But I'm not sure that's true.

53:53.563 --> 53:57.234
[Shoupe] The missing teens were last seen
on the night of September 27th

53:57.317 --> 54:01.279
on the road leading out to the point.
No foul play is expected at this time.

54:01.363 --> 54:02.989
We've set up a hotline.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.742
If you have any information
leading to their whereabouts,

54:05.825 --> 54:06.868
please give us a call.

54:06.952 --> 54:09.621
[John B] I don't think
the ocean washes away anything.

54:25.971 --> 54:29.849
If anything, the ocean makes you remember.

55:34.456 --> 55:35.498
How is he?

55:36.666 --> 55:39.044
Half dead for a long time.

55:41.212 --> 55:42.172
Out here.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.344
You wrote to me

56:30.720 --> 56:31.721
about the shroud.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.641
I know where it is.

56:35.975 --> 56:36.851
I can help you.

56:40.313 --> 56:41.272
But you

56:41.981 --> 56:43.983
have to help my son.
