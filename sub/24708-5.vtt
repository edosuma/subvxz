I had found some drugs
in my building.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.962
They were hidden
in a boom box
under the landing,

14:39.962 --> 14:44.425
-and I called it
to the police attention.
-When was this?

14:44.425 --> 14:48.888
Four nights,
which later I found out
was cocaine.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.391
And I left a note to tell 'em
where to find it.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.227
This was at the 27
you left the note?

14:55.227 --> 14:59.189
I couldn't--I couldn't look
to see what happened after,
'cause I'm downstairs.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.984
But next day it was gone.

15:01.984 --> 15:06.030
Then here come the drug dealer
looking for me,

15:06.030 --> 15:11.493
say he gonna kill me
either if I don't give him
his drugs or money, $37,000.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.496
Say he knew it was me
'cause of the storage area.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.332
-What was his name?
-He didn't say.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.876
-He's the guy that was in the
car with you and Kwasi?
-Yeah.

15:18.876 --> 15:24.798
-How'd Kwasi get into it?
-I had went to him,
'cause I was afraid.

15:24.798 --> 15:28.260
I was supposed to meet him
today at Fourth and "B."

15:28.260 --> 15:31.722
Wait a minute.
This is Prince, the guy
who wanted his drugs back?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.600
Or either he was
gonna kill me.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.562
I been afraid to tell him
that I had told the police,

15:38.562 --> 15:40.940
and I didn't know
what to do.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.360
-And I called Kwasi.
-Did he know Prince?

15:44.360 --> 15:49.281
Uh-uh. I just wanted Kwasi
to tell what happened.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.369
-And he did it for me.
-The other guy met you?

15:53.369 --> 15:58.415
He got out of his car
at Fourth and "B,"
got in Kwasi's backseat.

15:58.415 --> 16:04.046
Kwasi said that I called 911
to take the drugs away, and that
that was the right thing to do.

16:04.046 --> 16:08.425
And that if he harmed me
over it, Kwasi would call
the police himself.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.928
Then he said that
he had been fronted...

16:10.928 --> 16:14.181
for half those drugs,
and that who he owed
was after him.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.559
Kwasi's saying,
"Well, that's between y'all."

16:17.559 --> 16:19.728
Then hell broke loose.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.815
A car drove up
doing weird stuff
with their doors--

16:22.815 --> 16:25.067
closing 'em,
opening 'em weird.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.196
Then the shooting started.

16:29.196 --> 16:33.367
Kwasi drove off,
but he just drove into
the front of the building.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.161
He must've
already been shot.

16:36.161 --> 16:41.417
Then they came over
and shot the guy
in the backseat from close,

16:41.417 --> 16:45.045
-then drove off.
-But they didn't try
and shoot you.

16:45.045 --> 16:49.049
(snorts)
Kwasi fell over me in the seat.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.218
I don't know
if they even saw me.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.513
Seemed like they was
after the other one.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.808
-Did you get any kind
of look at them?
-Not much.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.853
-Jerome, what does that mean?
-I don't know how much
a look I got.

17:00.853 --> 17:05.524
I got a look at 'em,
but I don't know how much
in terms of recognizing.

17:05.524 --> 17:10.654
I'm not trying to lie to you.
I'll help you if I can.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.449
-You know someone
named Fat Cat?
-No.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.826
But he said something
about him--the Prince.

17:15.826 --> 17:20.497
Said his name about the drugs.
Fat Cat was who fronted him.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.421
-Could I get a soda?
-Yeah.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.383
(on speaker)
<i>Yeah, we'll get you something.</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:38.015
-You buy that?
-Do you?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.144
Sounds pretty good.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.188
Take him home, Josh.
Let him know
we'll need him back...

17:44.188 --> 17:47.191
to try to make I.D.'s
if we come up
with Fat Cat's button guys.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.359
-All right.
-Says he wants
a can of soda.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.445
I'll get it on the way out.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.573
-So we're gonna run it
for the mother?
-Yeah. Get her to go home.

17:54.573 --> 17:59.369

MAN: (chattering)

18:02.748 --> 18:06.502
Yeah, thanks for calling back.
I just wanted to ask you
a few questions.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.009
What did my brother say?
Was he involved?

18:14.676 --> 18:17.763
-(door closes)
-It's all right.

18:17.763 --> 18:23.352
Your brother turned in
some drugs to the police that
he had found in his building.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.146
When the dealer who had stashed
the drugs figured out it was
Jerome who'd found them,

18:26.146 --> 18:28.440
he started
threatening Jerome.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.901
Then Jerome asked Kwasi
to talk to the dealer.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.904
Kwasi--He, uh, stood up
for your brother.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.324
He told the dealer to leave
Jerome alone, and while
this all was happening...

18:37.324 --> 18:41.495
it looks like the people who
the dealer had gotten the drugs
from came and they shot 'em.

18:41.495 --> 18:46.125
-And they shot Kwasi too.
-That's what it looks like.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.877
So my dad was being
a good person.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.213
That's right, Hanna.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.552
All right. All right.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.971
Well, I know you probably
want to get home now.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.932
I want to know my husband's
killers are gonna be arrested.

19:01.932 --> 19:06.436
We got a good idea who to look
for, and we're gonna notify
you when anything happens.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.357
Do you have someone
to be with you, Margaret?

19:10.357 --> 19:14.403
I don't want you all
arranging my grieving any more
than my husband would.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.293
Bye.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.426
Sure hope we get
this Fat Cat's places
from the boss.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.429
Probably no use looking
till midnight.

19:40.429 --> 19:45.017
Yeah, they don't like
being out early if they're
not doing murders.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.687

sleeping blankets? I don't

about what happened.
-Come on. Sit over here.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.165
Lisa, a guy who hangs on
the street outside a bodega says
that right after the murder,

20:08.165 --> 20:10.375
you came running out,
right after the shots
were fired.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.545
Well, if you want
to believe a cough-syrup junkie
and a juicehead--

20:13.545 --> 20:15.839
You're saying you weren't
in the bodega?

20:15.839 --> 20:18.008
No, I'm just telling you
what Lonny is.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.053
And I happened to have
been in the bodega
to get a female product.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.597
Lonny says you were
doing some guys in there.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.975
Yeah, well,
Lonny wouldn't know sex
from an uptown bus.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.561
You don't make yourself
a witness, Lisa, we're gonna
make you an accomplice.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.105
So stop bum-rapping Lonny
and tell us what went on.

20:32.105 --> 20:35.525
I was in the bodega
to get a female product.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.071
Two gentlemen asked
to ask me something
in the basement.

20:39.071 --> 20:44.534
So I go down there with one
after the other one, and the
other one yells, "It's him."

20:44.534 --> 20:48.497
-Which was Oswaldo Mendoza.
-Not Oswaldo, the first
gentleman in the basement.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.874
Lisa, the guy you were
down there with that
went back upstairs--

20:50.874 --> 20:53.460
-I'm asking you:
Who was he talking about?
-Not Oswaldo.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.796
They were waiting
for someone to come in.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.674
The well-dressed guys
were waiting for the guy
who got murdered?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.927
-That's what I would gather.
-And what did Oswaldo
have to do with it?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.263
Oswaldo said I should
party with them.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.683
So now you're done
partying with the guy,
who already went back upstairs,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.893
and he shouts out,
"It's him."

21:09.893 --> 21:13.730
-What's the other guy
you're still doing do?
-He's straightenin' himself out.

21:13.730 --> 21:18.110
Then there is shots
and cryin' and moanin'.

21:18.110 --> 21:23.323
And he runs upstairs,
and I gather that they both
run out the alley door.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.493
-And where's Oswaldo?
-Oswaldo's gone.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.996
And the two well-dressed guys
Oswaldo had you party with--

21:28.996 --> 21:32.207
They were gone.
It's just the guy
that's whacked that's left.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.584
Yeah, bleedin' and cryin'
"<i>madre</i>" in Spanish.

21:34.584 --> 21:38.088
-And you book?
-Yeah, and that turd Lonny
gives me up.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.343
I cooperated fully.
I want to go.

21:43.343 --> 21:46.096
You're staying here
till we find Oswaldo.

21:46.096 --> 21:50.559
Oh, brother.
Can I at least get some stuff
from my girlfriend's?

Who're you kidding, Lisa?
Forget about
your crack pipe...

Oswaldo in here.
-(sighs)

Tell him he's a scumbag,
and he gets the neighborhood
he deserves.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.059
-Good day.
-Good day.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.269
-Hey, how's it going?
-Good.
How's yourself?

39:15.269 --> 39:16.729
All right.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.316
I guess we gotta
go kick this guy.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.942
(hand thuds)

39:30.743 --> 39:34.705
Did you hear her
tell that little girl
to hate me?

39:34.705 --> 39:36.290
Yeah.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.507
Come back from Vietnam,

39:44.507 --> 39:47.510
I go right on the job.

39:47.510 --> 39:51.180
Job don't send me
to the academy or nothing.

39:51.180 --> 39:55.851
Puts me undercover right away,
'cause--cause I'm who
they're looking for.

39:55.851 --> 39:59.313
Just out of the service,
working-class guy--

39:59.313 --> 40:04.276
all the credentials for being
some disillusioned asshole who
wants to piss on everything...

40:04.276 --> 40:08.406
I just spent
two and a half years
getting shot at about.

40:08.406 --> 40:12.451
I don't even get
to be with cops
when I'm debriefed.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.287
Some guy in the bottom
of the post office building...

40:15.287 --> 40:18.541
takes my information
and tells me what to do.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.253
Jerk in a suit--
He don't even tell me his name.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.338
He has me join
the Young Patriots.

40:24.338 --> 40:29.093
It's--It's like
the women's auxiliary
for the Black Panthers.

40:29.093 --> 40:34.473
I get to bring
the Panthers coffee
and lead cheers.

40:34.473 --> 40:37.977
"Right on," you know.
"Oh, you said a mouthful,
brother."

40:37.977 --> 40:41.230
"Let's definitely take
that bank off."

40:43.274 --> 40:45.734
Then I go work my cover job
unloading furniture.

40:45.734 --> 40:50.656
And then I go home and I drink
myself stupid so as not to run
my head into the wall,

40:50.656 --> 40:52.908
thinking how much I hate
what I'm doing.

40:52.908 --> 40:57.329
I sat in rice paddies the night
so dark you didn't know
which way was up,

40:57.329 --> 41:01.709
wanting to scream and shoot
your gun off for light and you'd
know where the hell you were,

41:01.709 --> 41:06.338
so I could come home and do
chores and hear my country get
pissed on by a bunch of spades!

41:06.338 --> 41:10.676
Hey, Andy!
Don't start talking like that,
all right?

41:12.720 --> 41:15.014
I'm trying to explain
something to you.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.017
And I'm telling you
that when you use
that kind of language,

41:18.017 --> 41:21.187
I can't get to
what you're saying.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.898
You don't have
to call 'em spades
to tell what happened.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.276
-Spades is how I feel.
-You call that
little girl a spade?

41:27.276 --> 41:29.069
She's not who
I was talking about.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.448
Well, that's who I see
when you're talking.
You follow my problem?

41:32.448 --> 41:35.576
Hey, forget about it.
You have a nice night.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.496
I was trying to explain
something to you.
Excuse me for--

41:38.496 --> 41:40.748
for trying to talk
to my partner.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.416
(scoffs)

41:46.462 --> 41:48.130
Go ahead, partner.

41:48.130 --> 41:52.051
(sniffs)
It was hard for me.
You understand that, huh?

41:52.051 --> 41:55.930
Come back to the world--
Least I--I thought I could
talk to somebody,

41:55.930 --> 41:59.183
and maybe somebody, uh,
respects what I did.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.560
I dreamt of being a cop.

42:01.560 --> 42:05.564
Now a cop sees me
on the street he spits--
he spits on the ground.

42:05.564 --> 42:09.026
And I know he's supposed to,
'cause I'm kissing
bastards' asses...

42:09.026 --> 42:13.072
want to blow up the bank
that my mother pays
her house loans at.

42:13.072 --> 42:16.951
And I'm telling these bastards
how brave and great
I think they are.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.412
How I loved it when my dad--
He-He finally saved enough...

42:20.412 --> 42:23.582
after he's in the service
to move us from the Quonsets.

42:23.582 --> 42:26.669
And we're finally
in a decent neighborhood
until they move in.

42:26.669 --> 42:30.673
I gotta fight to keep
my lunch money, and the project
turns into a sty.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.842
And he gets his eye put out
by one of 'em drunk
with a hammer...

42:33.842 --> 42:36.637
who don't want
his gas meter read.

42:39.890 --> 42:44.019
To have her tell
that little girl to hate me--

42:45.604 --> 42:47.523
I try to do my job.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.443
Put your own feelings aside
unless they show you
they're wrong.

42:51.443 --> 42:55.447
And that sweet little girl
is told to hate me.

42:55.447 --> 43:00.786
But what is she supposed to do,
Andy? She supposed to feel
sorry for you?

43:00.786 --> 43:03.289
She's supposed to think
it's okay you call
her father a nigger...

43:03.289 --> 43:05.624
because you had
bad times growing up?

43:05.624 --> 43:09.461
I had bad times from them people
my whole life.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.007
Hey, my dad got his ass kicked
at shape-ups...

43:13.007 --> 43:16.176
by white longshoremen
for being dark-skinned.

43:16.176 --> 43:21.181
I don't hate them people,
and I don't hate you.

43:21.181 --> 43:25.519
But I'm supposed to care
what happened to her people
300 years ago.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.149
There you go.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.528
At least she shook my hand.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.448
Yeah.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.410
I don't think
she hated me that much.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.296
(door closes)

44:04.224 --> 44:07.227
