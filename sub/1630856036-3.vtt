00:14.640 --> 00:18.018
<i>An English duke
A handsome man</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.604
<i>Who's gonna be his duchess?</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:21.897
Nan!

00:22.814 --> 00:25.275
<i>Oh, Duchess Nan, Duchess Nan</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:27.778
<i>"Oh, I could never marry
Oh, wait, he's a duke?"</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:30.531
- Conchie, stop it.
- <i>"Yes, I can"</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:33.742
It doesn't even scan.
You know I didn't know he was a duke.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.369
She didn't know he was a duke.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.912
She thought he was an artist.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.081
- Well, why didn't you just say?
- Stop it. Seriously.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.792
How can I marry him? I've met him twice.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.002
He barely knows me.
He knows nothing about me at all.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.130
Oh, darling. After the wedding
is when the knowing starts.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.799
Marriage is...

00:51.009 --> 00:52.010
Don't underestimate it.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.554
If anything, I've overestimated it.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.473
I've been estimating it
every single moment since he's asked.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.935
I can't possibly be a duchess.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.312
Give me one good reason
why you couldn't be a duchess.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.313
What actually is a duchess?

01:07.276 --> 01:09.903
It's just that Theo-- He appeared, and...

01:11.989 --> 01:13.282
he just made me feel--

01:13.282 --> 01:16.159
- He made you feel!
- Stop. Stop it.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.539
Like I could escape somehow
and when I'm with him,

01:20.539 --> 01:23.333
I could just--
I can almost just forget who I am.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.710
I'll tell you who you are.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.172
You're a person
whose crazy engagement got us invited

01:28.172 --> 01:31.633
to the Duchess of Tintagel's private ball.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.970
- Can you imagine?
- Wouldn't Lizzy just love this?

01:34.970 --> 01:36.221
Still no letter?

01:37.556 --> 01:40.017
I can't believe she didn't tell anyone
why she was going home.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.603
She looked so pale
when she set off for the ship.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.605
It's just not like Lizzy.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.232
Well, we'll be back home with her
in just a few weeks.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.068
Poor Jinny thinks we're going to New York
for her enormous wedding,

01:50.068 --> 01:52.696
but I intend on spending
the entire trip cuddling Lizzy

01:52.696 --> 01:56.950
and the poodle and pretending
England doesn't exist.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.494
Girls! Girls.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.792
Girls, say goodbye to Conchita.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.838
I'm back in character.
Obedient and demure.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.633
Conchie, are you--

03:36.633 --> 03:39.344
Of course. I'm the perfect wife.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.190
Miss St. George?

03:51.190 --> 03:54.568
The duchess invites you to meet her
in the drawing room this afternoon.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.197
Also, from the duke.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.453
Conchita!

04:07.039 --> 04:10.250
You're here. Come and see inside.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.425
I can't stand to see Conchita--

04:21.136 --> 04:22.137
Nan?

04:46.578 --> 04:47.579
Hello.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.252
Hello.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.345
So you're not painting, then?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.474
I fear I may have ambushed you
at Runnymede.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.059
By being a secret duke?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.646
I am a duke.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.816
So I gathered, eventually.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.901
And I wanted to say...

05:21.071 --> 05:26.243
when I asked you to be my wife,
I wanted it to be a pure question,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.997
unburdened by context.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.131
This is who I am.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.718
Though, I'm afraid I come with a price.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.014
We must survive tonight's ball,

05:47.598 --> 05:50.684
the whole performance of the thing.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.898
And after that, if you feel it--
it's not the life for you...

05:59.151 --> 06:00.527
then you must call it off.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.531
You mean that?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.742
With no reflection on your reputation.

06:07.910 --> 06:12.831
I'm afraid my context is inescapable.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.794
But I would like to show you,
if I may, the full picture.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.339
So that you can make a real choice.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.135
To be a duchess.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.972
To be with me.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.519
The actual me.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.032
All this way
to drink tea in someone else's house.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.244
Balls.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.164
Endless unnecessary expense
leading to inevitable disappointment.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.041
Like marriage, then?

06:57.209 --> 06:58.627
Or parenthood.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.550
Only two hours late.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.302
What was it, ribbon shopping
or dancing with the footmen?

07:16.478 --> 07:18.647
A relief, Richard, to have some peace.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.816
You finally got her to behave.

07:21.817 --> 07:22.860
Well done, you.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.950
Are all of your friends coming
this evening?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.661
One of them
scuttled off to New York with the mothers.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.456
The pretty one. Nothing useful to say.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.624
Could be any of them.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.418
Lizzy went back home to New York,

07:40.169 --> 07:44.047
but the rest are all invited.
So, yes. Of course.

07:45.424 --> 07:50.554
Conchita, she's here!
It's Jinny! Jinny's here!

07:53.974 --> 07:57.144
How the duchess tolerates
this barbarian invasion.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.228
How any of us do?

07:58.228 --> 08:01.940
Well, let's hope
Seadown's girl is a little more docile.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.235
We must just grit our teeth
and think of the money she'll bring.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.988
If it gets that far.
He may just be toying with her.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.102
May I present Lady Seadown.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.733
- We eloped. Can you believe it?
- No.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.318
I'm afraid we simply couldn't wait.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.903
But what about New York
and the wedding plans?

08:47.903 --> 08:50.531
Your mother's measured every cathedral
in Manhattan.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.158
I know. But when you've absolutely decided
what you want--

08:53.158 --> 08:56.995
Love isn't about the display and the fuss.
That's what we realized, isn't it?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.039
- Love is about the two of us.
- The romance.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.501
Lord and Lady Seadown.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.004
- Congratulations!
- Oh, my goodness. Congratulations!

09:06.672 --> 09:07.881
- Congratulations.
- So happy for you.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.091
Thanks, Conchita.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.010
Congratulations.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.931
They eloped? Pure theater.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.398
<i>She looked happy.</i>

09:24.398 --> 09:27.734
Well, everyone's happy for about
three seconds after their wedding.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.028
Dick and I
were either looking at each other

09:30.028 --> 09:31.947
or touching each other,
or both, for weeks.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.448
But if Jinny wants to--

09:33.448 --> 09:36.368
It's not about what we want, darling.
Trust me.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.703
If we all got what we wanted,

09:37.703 --> 09:39.872
I'd be in New York
with a house full of men

09:39.872 --> 09:42.332
and cream cakes and poodles--

09:42.332 --> 09:45.752
But eloping. If there's one thing
that I'd pick out that Jinny wouldn't--

09:46.753 --> 09:48.589
I've prepared her bottle, Lady Marable.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.048
Thank you so much.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.467
- Do you need anything else?
- No, that's all.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.844
You're an angel. Thank you.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.393
You know, I thought at least they'd
approve of me hiring Miss Testvalley,

10:01.393 --> 10:03.103
seeing as they used her themselves,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.813
but of course,
they just hate everything I do.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.065
But do you think that
Jinny is actually ha--

10:07.065 --> 10:09.193
In that family, the best hope is survival.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.153
But I've worked out the secret.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.946
Silence.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.991
No voice, no opinions.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.120
It's better to be lonely and approved of
than lonely and glowered at.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.207
It is like
the lights have gone out in you.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.128
Yes, but when the lights are out,

10:29.171 --> 10:30.714
and it's quite dark,

10:32.508 --> 10:34.593
there's no need for apologizing.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.138
And besides, I'm not alone.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.725
I have a baby. And now
Jinny's my sister-in-law.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.687
But it's her whole life,
and she barely knows him.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.856
Are we still talking about Jinny?

10:48.440 --> 10:49.608
Let's get you a bottle.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.747
Sorry. Is Jinny here?

11:03.747 --> 11:07.125
We're rather unprepared for visitors.

11:09.628 --> 11:13.257
I-- There's just the tour of the castle,

11:13.257 --> 11:15.926
and I just wanted to see that--
if Jinny wanted to--

11:20.556 --> 11:22.224
She's looking forward to seeing you
at the ball.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.852
Okay. Thank you.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.187
I'll see you tonight!

11:41.785 --> 11:43.328
You know, your parents, they seem so--

11:43.328 --> 11:46.039
My parents have very high standards,
but you'll more than meet them,

11:47.624 --> 11:48.917
Lady Seadown.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.378
What's it like to be so perfect?

11:53.005 --> 11:56.341
I never thought that I was
until you started telling me.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.637
I mean, I do my best, of course.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.808
Your trying is one of the things
I love the most about you.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.977
Your perfect concentration.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.355
Let others concern themselves
with being peacocks.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.028
Such magnificent beauty here.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.616
It's entirely matched by
what's inside here.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.996
And pretty world-class
on the outside, that bit too, of course.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.709
James, can you imagine if we'd never met?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.337
No.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.345
All those years we spent
not knowing each other...

12:43.805 --> 12:44.932
and now I've got you.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.434
My Jinny.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.668
Nice view.

13:14.378 --> 13:17.506
I just thought I'd sit for a while.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.175
What are you reading?

13:20.926 --> 13:21.927
A book.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.181
Yeah, I think I heard of that.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.940
So, Jinny and Seadown. Did you hear?

13:36.775 --> 13:38.485
Your mother, is she--

13:38.485 --> 13:41.530
Appalled, naturally, at the speed.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.532
Though, when the bills must be paid...

13:45.492 --> 13:49.997
Wow. Your family are desperate
to make my friends feel worthless

13:49.997 --> 13:52.040
when they lower themselves
to marry your brothers.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.711
Let's try and be happy for them, shall we?

14:11.018 --> 14:12.019
Come in.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.532
- Annabel.
- I am glad to be here, Your Grace.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.951
Are you? Or are you terrified?

14:29.411 --> 14:31.413
Might I be half-glad and half-terrified?

14:32.331 --> 14:33.832
Exactly as it should be.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.386
I've never visited America.
Ought I to bother?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.681
- Yes, it's a very fine country--
- I'm going to stop you.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.018
I'm extremely busy, it's a long way away
and it's best to be realistic.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.897
What do you love about my son?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.319
- I--
- Quite right. You barely know him.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.739
Marriage is alarming enough.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.076
If young people understood
how terrified of it they ought to be,

15:09.076 --> 15:10.577
the clergy would go out of business.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.081
My son barely knows you, of course,

15:14.081 --> 15:16.041
but I'm afraid
he's impossibly in love with you.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.045
Did he say that?

15:20.045 --> 15:21.505
He spent the last ten years

15:21.505 --> 15:24.216
being chased around every gathering
and every drawing room

15:24.216 --> 15:26.802
by every half-eligible girl in England.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.179
And in all the years we've held
the end-of-season ball,

15:29.179 --> 15:30.931
he's never once brought a guest.

15:30.931 --> 15:34.601
His face has never once softened the way
it softens when he mentions your name.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.856
What will you wear tonight?

15:42.401 --> 15:44.820
It's perfectly possible
to care about the state of the world

15:44.820 --> 15:46.947
whilst also being frivolous about dresses.

15:47.531 --> 15:48.532
I quite agree.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.953
I'm wearing a blue dress, cornflower blue.

15:53.453 --> 15:58.792
It has this beautiful thing
from here to there.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.710
Charming.

15:59.710 --> 16:03.589
I wore a dress in the same blue
to the Dorchester Ball when I was 19.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.342
Theodore's father said
I looked like a bluebell.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.887
If I wore it now, of course,
I'd look like a sea creature,

16:09.887 --> 16:11.471
- but you'll get away with it.
- I bet you--

16:11.471 --> 16:14.224
With age and wisdom
come many advantages and adventures

16:14.224 --> 16:18.562
which far outweigh a small waist
and soft complexion. I promise you.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.859
All this, the title...

16:26.069 --> 16:27.821
is not easy for everyone.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.199
It's not easy for Theo, of course.

16:30.908 --> 16:33.702
He loathes it, only wants to paint.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.831
I've asked him to paint me
with a glint in my eye, and he won't.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.419
But Annabel,
I believe he'll put a glint in yours.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.297
Now off you go. I have my drink to finish.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.139
Your Grace, if you'll permit me,

16:55.307 --> 16:59.853
I do see a glint in your eye,
entirely of your own making, not man-made.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.898
And I do think that
if you wore that blue dress

17:03.398 --> 17:04.858
you would still look like a bluebell.

17:06.984 --> 17:07.986
You're quite wrong.

17:08.779 --> 17:11.490
Bluebells hang their heads.
They're famous for it.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.160
I may have hung my head
at the Dorchester Ball when I was 19,

17:15.160 --> 17:18.789
but I'm a duchess now,
and my head is always absolutely upright.

17:19.957 --> 17:20.999
As yours must be.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.502
At least in public.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.971
So, the portraits
are of the Tintagel family members

17:33.971 --> 17:36.306
who well--

17:36.890 --> 17:38.600
How many times have you visited?

17:39.685 --> 17:41.103
- Every year.
- Oh, God.

17:42.145 --> 17:46.108
Next, we will see the dining room
where the family--

17:46.108 --> 17:48.777
Dines? Slides down the table?

17:50.362 --> 17:53.115
We do have castles in New York, you know.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.159
They built one in Central Park
a few years ago.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.786
When was this one built?

17:58.537 --> 18:01.748
1342. Originally.

18:04.626 --> 18:05.627
Okay.

18:08.213 --> 18:12.176
After that, we'll see the staterooms
for when the dignitaries visit.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.434
The rest of the castle exists, of course.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.855
But out here,
I can at least pretend it doesn't.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.678
It's a sanctuary, I suppose.

18:58.764 --> 19:00.182
A place to consider.

19:02.768 --> 19:03.769
Or to feel...

19:05.938 --> 19:06.939
nothing at all.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.650
Which is sometimes equally appealing.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.668
I don't paint people, generally.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.381
It's almost like it moves.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.633
They're only colors on a canvas.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.637
If I tried to put colors on a canvas...

19:40.722 --> 19:41.849
it would be...

19:44.393 --> 19:45.394
Be my guest.

20:34.234 --> 20:38.238
I don't know what it is, but it could be...

20:40.407 --> 20:41.783
a snake.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.871
Or a worm. I don't know.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.710
I thought you didn't paint people.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.715
You're not people.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.870
The landscapes here are really beautiful.

22:08.579 --> 22:12.875
You know, when I stayed nearby,
I went and walked, and I walked and I--

22:12.875 --> 22:15.294
But I barely began to...

22:17.337 --> 22:19.965
I guess the best way to see it all
would be on a horse.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.385
Is there much riding in New York City?

22:23.886 --> 22:24.887
No.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.433
But there is in Saratoga.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.484
It's okay.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.906
It's okay.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.955
Wha-- Why are you--

23:34.039 --> 23:36.416
Whoa. Hey.
Right, if you could just grab the bridle--

23:36.416 --> 23:37.709
I know how to catch a horse.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.919
I saw you were in trouble, so I--

23:38.919 --> 23:40.295
- I'm not one of those girls...
- Nan?

23:40.295 --> 23:42.047
...who gets in trouble
and needs helping down from horses.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.465
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.967
I'm-- I am completely fine.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.469
I thought you were going to be late.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.971
And miss a chance to be shouted at?

23:49.638 --> 23:52.474
Nan, this is Guy Thwarte,
my oldest friend.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.102
How are you?

23:55.602 --> 23:58.689
You're all Mother's talked about.
Well, you and Nan.

23:59.273 --> 24:03.527
Yes,
I imagine she wants to hear all about Nan.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.199
You know, Jinny's in for a rude awakening.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.701
That family doesn't like anyone.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.244
They don't even like each other.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.580
Nan, do you think Dick will like my hair
like this?

24:14.580 --> 24:18.458
I can still be beautiful yet dutiful, right?

24:22.588 --> 24:25.215
For Miss St. George? From the duchess.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.813
This thing must be
five million years old. Wow.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.358
Let's see.

24:45.319 --> 24:48.071
So, little Nan,
how's the calling-it-off going?

24:49.072 --> 24:52.284
This might be the first time
you're more dressed up than me.

24:52.284 --> 24:55.746
Did you imagine this day would ever come?
It's gonna be so--

25:01.710 --> 25:05.672
My parents are asking if we'd join them
for a drink on the terrace.

25:06.507 --> 25:07.549
They asked for me?

25:08.133 --> 25:11.136
Of course, Lady Marable.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.730
Oh, my gosh. It's working.
I'm no longer their worst daughter-in-law.

25:22.814 --> 25:23.815
Good luck.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.995
Nan? Where's my emerald bracelet?

25:36.995 --> 25:39.331
Oh, my God. There you are.
Here, come on in.

25:39.331 --> 25:42.376
- Finally. Jinny.
- I asked you to return it--

25:42.918 --> 25:45.045
Are you happy? Truly?

25:45.045 --> 25:47.965
What? Of course, darling. I'm married.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.843
- Oh, Jinny, I just wanted to--
- Mother will be furious, of course,

25:50.843 --> 25:53.345
but at least you won't have to wear
the coral bridesmaid dress.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.304
It was orange,

25:54.304 --> 25:56.098
and I would have looked like an onion
for certain,

25:56.098 --> 25:59.017
but I would have gladly worn it because
I knew that's something you wanted.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.102
Oh, darling.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.271
I know you've got this sweet thing
going with the duke,

26:02.271 --> 26:04.982
but when you really, truly love someone--

26:04.982 --> 26:06.149
I love you.

26:06.942 --> 26:09.486
I love you, I do.

26:10.571 --> 26:11.905
But this is what I want.

26:12.906 --> 26:16.535
And you? Are you and Theo...

26:17.578 --> 26:19.538
How can I even think about marrying him...

26:21.623 --> 26:22.624
when I'm...

26:25.043 --> 26:28.130
I don't even know who my mother is?

26:28.130 --> 26:31.091
Yes, well, nobody knows,
so how would he ever find out?

26:32.050 --> 26:33.051
Virginia?

26:35.137 --> 26:36.847
I will talk to you tomorrow, okay?

26:36.847 --> 26:40.267
I promise. Or later.
I promise, okay? We'll talk later.

27:18.639 --> 27:20.349
They've given you the yellow room then.

27:23.185 --> 27:24.520
Quite right, of course.

27:25.062 --> 27:27.022
You're far more important than me now.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.526
Though, much less dressed.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.029
God, sorry, I'll just-- I'll--

27:34.029 --> 27:37.324
So will you tell him?

27:38.951 --> 27:40.494
Will you tell Theo about my mother?

27:43.163 --> 27:46.583
He's a duke, you may have noticed.

27:47.376 --> 27:50.796
And he resents it, of course, every day.
But Nan, he absolutely lives by it.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.798
And for a duke to marry--

27:53.507 --> 27:54.508
Someone like me.

27:56.677 --> 27:57.886
He couldn't possibly.

27:57.886 --> 27:59.429
He'd be a laughingstock.

27:59.429 --> 28:03.517
He'd lose any shred of credibility
or authority.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.478
- You haven't told him yourself?
- No.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.231
No, it just makes people run away.

28:11.650 --> 28:14.361
I've never lied to him our whole lives.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.446
And tonight?

28:26.206 --> 28:27.749
Mr. Thwarte was just...

28:27.749 --> 28:30.085
And if there's anything else you need
to know about the yellow room,

28:30.085 --> 28:31.378
feel free to ask.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.213
Just down the hall.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.217
Good decision to get her a dress.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.344
Yeah. Good decision.

28:54.026 --> 28:55.819
Shoulders back, old girl. Shoulders back.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.614
Back to the summer of 1879, ideally.

28:58.614 --> 29:01.074
When we still held hope
of finding you a husband.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.748
Which version of American
will this one be, one wonders?

29:07.748 --> 29:10.417
Stormy seas enough to make one
almost fearful.

29:10.918 --> 29:13.879
Or wind subsided, waters entirely shallow?

29:14.838 --> 29:17.132
Sisters now, yes? Good luck.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.349
It's customary, I understand,

29:25.349 --> 29:29.561
when one's son elopes,
to feel disappointment.

29:29.561 --> 29:31.813
Were you looking forward
to a big bash, Mother?

29:32.648 --> 29:34.316
A large public celebration of love?

29:34.316 --> 29:39.112
- Weddings exhaust me, as you know.
- Lengthy, expensive, loud.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.948
The disappointment, in this case,

29:41.782 --> 29:47.621
is that we believed Virginia
might be different from her friends.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.461
Our only goal, Lady Brightlingsea,

29:54.461 --> 29:56.755
was to save you the fuss
of a garish wedding.

29:57.256 --> 30:00.884
I assure you an elopement drama
is entirely unlike me.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.263
As a wife, my chief aim will always be
to avoid a show

30:04.930 --> 30:06.598
and to meet your expectations,

30:06.598 --> 30:08.684
as well as those of my husband.

30:09.184 --> 30:12.980
So I believe that I am different,
quite different.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.482
Less of a peacock.

30:20.696 --> 30:22.281
Calmer seas, ahoy.

30:32.958 --> 30:34.877
They're saying we're already late.

30:35.919 --> 30:37.337
Better crack on, then.

30:48.390 --> 30:49.224
Don't.

30:49.224 --> 30:52.686
- I did. I told you.
- I said in England.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.605
In all of England,
no girl would ever be of interest.

30:54.605 --> 30:57.441
Absolutely not. I said, one day,
someone was gonna change your mind.

30:57.441 --> 30:59.943
We didn't specify continent.

30:59.943 --> 31:04.823
Well, in that case,
thank you for knowing I was an idiot.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.325
A given.

31:10.078 --> 31:13.832
And also for sampling so very many
of the available options on my behalf.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.337
Though, how you manage such success
when you still can't tie your own tie.

31:23.967 --> 31:27.471
That weekend at Runnymede,

31:29.431 --> 31:32.476
Nan and I talked a little.

31:32.476 --> 31:33.727
And isn't she extraordinary?

31:35.270 --> 31:38.315
She moves in such an unexpected way.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.068
- Have you noticed?
- I mean...

31:41.693 --> 31:44.112
- I don't mean gracefully.
- ...yes.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.405
Because actually,

31:45.405 --> 31:48.951
- she isn't always graceful.
- God, no. She's--

31:48.951 --> 31:50.410
I mean, she's all over the place.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.412
- Yeah.
- But did you see her on a horse?

31:52.996 --> 31:58.794
She's wherever I turn, somehow,
laughing, thinking, surprising me.

32:00.254 --> 32:01.630
Making me catch my breath.

32:03.632 --> 32:07.010
I mean, she's entirely remarkable.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.347
Well, you've met her.

32:11.056 --> 32:12.057
Barely.

32:13.517 --> 32:16.103
Though, I heard you proposed
after about three minutes.

32:16.103 --> 32:17.855
And it could easily have been two.

32:21.191 --> 32:22.192
I just...

32:27.406 --> 32:28.407
Marriage.

32:30.868 --> 32:33.745
Just be sure you know
all there is to know.

32:56.310 --> 33:00.063
- My dress is so tight.
- You look absolutely beautiful.

33:01.106 --> 33:03.609
- So do you.
- I know. But nobody's looking at me.

33:07.112 --> 33:08.530
- What am I doing?
- What?

33:10.115 --> 33:11.533
I am pretending to everyone.

33:12.117 --> 33:13.744
Who cares about everyone?

33:14.494 --> 33:17.414
Nan, do you like him?

33:19.833 --> 33:21.001
I think so.

33:23.170 --> 33:24.171
Yes.

33:25.088 --> 33:26.590
- Nan.
- Where's Jinny?

33:26.590 --> 33:28.967
Nan, listen. Nan.

33:29.510 --> 33:30.511
Annabel!

33:31.929 --> 33:34.306
Tonight's not about Jinny or Conchita.

33:34.932 --> 33:35.933
It's about you.

33:35.933 --> 33:38.018
And you know what?

33:38.018 --> 33:41.813
It's absolutely fine
to decide you completely love it.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.900
You're allowed to feel special.

33:46.401 --> 33:47.861
Maybe you were born for this.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.074
Okay?

34:02.835 --> 34:05.045
Miss Annabel St. George.

34:50.132 --> 34:51.800
- American.
- Yes.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.178
But just lovely despite that.

34:55.179 --> 34:56.638
The perfect duchess.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.183
And my goodness, we've waited long enough.

35:00.767 --> 35:03.854
You're beautiful. Do you loathe it?

35:04.438 --> 35:05.647
Being beautiful?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.108
But I expect that feels old hat.

35:08.859 --> 35:10.819
No. Do you loathe all this?

35:11.904 --> 35:14.448
I don't know yet. Do you?

35:15.324 --> 35:17.826
Not tonight. Which is a novelty.

35:18.827 --> 35:21.747
Everything, it seems,
is immeasurably improved by you.

36:22.307 --> 36:24.643
Thank heavens, someone I don't despise.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.105
- Not dancing?
- I was waiting for you.

36:28.605 --> 36:29.982
So like your mother.

36:29.982 --> 36:32.693
- She would've danced tonight.
- Wouldn't she?

36:33.527 --> 36:36.530
Well, what's the verdict?

36:42.536 --> 36:44.705
I believe Nan will surprise us all.

36:55.966 --> 36:57.593
Everything's changing, isn't it?

37:00.304 --> 37:02.556
Yes. It is.

37:04.308 --> 37:06.310
For God's sake, let's have a drink.

37:14.735 --> 37:16.320
Strangest night of your life?

37:16.320 --> 37:19.740
Easily. And only partly
because you're being so well-behaved.

37:19.740 --> 37:23.744
I'm the most tedious person here.
It's a stiff competition.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.372
I mean, I said to the girl, "Tea?"

37:27.372 --> 37:31.043
I'm not interested in
these newfangled intermediate meals.

37:31.043 --> 37:34.004
Why can't people eat enough at luncheon
to last them until dinner?

37:35.047 --> 37:36.089
It's ridiculous.

37:36.089 --> 37:38.759
God, everything is so easy for Jinny.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.677
For both of you.

37:41.178 --> 37:44.139
Nan, is it actually gonna turn out
you get the dream?

37:44.139 --> 37:46.141
'Cause that would be just like you.

37:49.061 --> 37:52.564
Is your mother laughing?
She's actually laughing.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.942
Next minute they're gonna be
braiding each other's hair.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.026
Don't torture yourself.

37:56.026 --> 37:59.029
- Jinny's different, that's all.
- Yes. Different from a peacock, sure.

37:59.738 --> 38:03.075
Is there a bird
that's called a backstabber?

38:03.075 --> 38:04.785
If there is, they don't live in England.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.286
How very fortunate for them.

38:07.538 --> 38:09.498
Well, I just mean she's different fro--

38:09.498 --> 38:10.707
- from--
- Me?

38:14.837 --> 38:16.505
You worked it out, haven't you?

38:17.422 --> 38:18.632
Anyone can see that.

38:20.259 --> 38:22.302
Of course,
Jinny's just the same as all of you.

38:22.302 --> 38:23.887
But-- No, I didn't mean...

38:31.228 --> 38:32.479
There you have the breakfast.

38:32.479 --> 38:35.065
And dinner, then there's no elevenses,
no, no.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.484
- And then at dinner...
- Excuse me.

38:37.484 --> 38:38.777
...about seven-seven--

38:41.113 --> 38:42.489
Will I ever be good enough?

38:43.907 --> 38:47.327
I've tried being me,
and I've tried being someone else.

38:48.453 --> 38:50.581
Is there any point in me trying at all?

38:50.581 --> 38:54.084
- Conchita, don't raise your voice. Please.
- My voice isn't raised.

38:54.668 --> 38:55.961
That's a first.

38:58.255 --> 38:59.548
What is it about Jinny?

39:01.300 --> 39:05.179
What, with her blonde hair
and pale skin you've accepted so quickly?

39:06.138 --> 39:07.181
All of you.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.267
That would be very easy, I'm sure.

39:10.267 --> 39:12.644
No, thank you.
We're not accepting those accusations.

39:12.644 --> 39:16.481
- Perhaps you might think in those terms...
- Every day.

39:16.481 --> 39:20.277
I'm afraid we simply don't.
We're oblivious.

39:22.654 --> 39:23.655
Lucky you.

39:26.950 --> 39:32.497
Conchita, if you're asking who to be here,
your role is clear.

39:33.373 --> 39:36.168
Mother to a child who's healthy,

39:36.752 --> 39:39.171
daughter to a man who's wealthy.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.685
Stormy seas are back, then?

39:54.770 --> 39:56.563
Ought we to--
No.

39:57.814 --> 40:00.067
When we reward bad behavior in children,

40:00.609 --> 40:03.612
we remove any incentive
for them to grow up.

40:21.463 --> 40:22.464
Conchita!

40:47.114 --> 40:48.615
Looks awful, doesn't it?

40:50.617 --> 40:51.618
Hideous.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.386
You've been on the fringes all night.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.054
- I want you to have fun.
- No.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.139
Come on.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.037
Why did you leave?

42:18.372 --> 42:19.623
At Runnymede.

42:26.421 --> 42:28.048
Well, I can understand why, but I...

42:30.717 --> 42:31.844
but how could you?

42:34.471 --> 42:37.015
After I told you something
that was so important to me.

42:38.642 --> 42:40.269
Something that was so essential.

42:42.145 --> 42:44.356
I thought that you were a person
I could talk to.

42:47.442 --> 42:53.407
In fact, I was a scared person.

42:53.991 --> 42:58.704
Well, if it was so shocking,
and you couldn't endure my shame...

43:02.040 --> 43:03.083
save Theo.

43:04.710 --> 43:05.961
You must, of course.

43:08.630 --> 43:09.631
Tell him.

43:13.427 --> 43:14.469
Why wouldn't you?

43:20.392 --> 43:23.145
Where's Richard? It's Conchita.

43:29.902 --> 43:31.320
Conchita!

43:31.320 --> 43:34.072
This is just what she wants.
Conchita doesn't get lost.

43:35.073 --> 43:37.201
- Conchita!
- Was she heading for the cliffs?

43:37.201 --> 43:40.454
- She's just doing it for attention.
- But, Nan, I'm her husband.

43:42.164 --> 43:43.874
So it's my job to give it to her.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.376
Conchita!

43:46.376 --> 43:47.711
Just let him be.

43:47.711 --> 43:51.757
She's always fine.
This is just what she does.

43:56.678 --> 43:57.679
Conchita!

44:01.308 --> 44:03.977
I could have just gone to bed. I--

44:05.479 --> 44:07.189
I almost did, in fact.

44:07.189 --> 44:09.149
But I expect if I had, I--

44:11.026 --> 44:14.696
I probably would have just
got back up again.

44:44.560 --> 44:45.978
Conchita!

44:49.940 --> 44:51.316
Conchita.

44:51.316 --> 44:55.320
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.407
Why would you possibly be sorry?

44:59.992 --> 45:00.993
I'm sorry.

45:02.244 --> 45:03.245
You're right.

45:03.245 --> 45:06.081
About my family.
About the way they treat you.

45:06.748 --> 45:07.875
I love you.

45:10.419 --> 45:12.880
I heard you at Runnymede.

45:13.547 --> 45:17.009
You said that there are women,
and then there are wives.

45:18.385 --> 45:19.386
Conchita.

45:20.220 --> 45:24.183
I want you to be both.
But I want you to be you.

45:26.685 --> 45:27.811
Let's go to New York.

45:29.021 --> 45:31.315
- We work there, don't we?
- Yes.

45:31.315 --> 45:33.317
Let's escape for a while.

45:33.317 --> 45:34.902
- Just the three of us.
- Okay.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.695
And let's remember who we are.

45:46.121 --> 45:48.373
Okay.
Well, now I'm actually getting worried.

45:50.459 --> 45:52.127
How long has it been?
Maybe we should have--

45:52.628 --> 45:54.004
We should have definitely gone--

45:54.505 --> 45:55.631
Conchita, are you all right?

45:55.631 --> 45:56.715
She lives.

45:57.674 --> 46:00.761
- She's fine.
- Oh, darling, aren't I always?

46:01.386 --> 46:03.055
I'll tell the others she's safe.

46:03.722 --> 46:04.932
Thank you, sir.

46:08.435 --> 46:10.145
I'll have them draw you a nice hot bath.

46:11.563 --> 46:13.440
More water? I shall drown.

46:16.818 --> 46:18.946
Oh, darling. I hope you weren't
too worried about me.

46:20.239 --> 46:21.573
Are you asking about me?

46:21.573 --> 46:23.659
Dick came running after me and found me.

46:23.659 --> 46:25.744
Of course, we're still talking about you.

46:25.744 --> 46:29.414
How are you not exhausted by the fact
that everyone's constantly looking for you

46:29.414 --> 46:32.376
- or looking at you?
- Gosh. Can I help it if they look?

46:32.376 --> 46:34.419
You can try not running out
into the middle of the night,

46:34.419 --> 46:36.505
making everyone think
you've fallen off a cliff.

46:38.215 --> 46:40.300
One night was supposed to be about me.

46:40.968 --> 46:43.679
If you even break a nail,
I immediately jump to the rescue.

46:43.679 --> 46:44.888
But if I have any problems,

46:44.888 --> 46:47.182
- big or small--
- What problems do you have?

46:47.683 --> 46:49.768
What, with your duke
and his necklace-giving mother?

46:49.768 --> 46:52.855
How would you possibly know?
There's no space,

46:52.855 --> 46:54.898
- there's no time to talk about me...
- I cannot--

46:54.898 --> 46:56.859
- ...when every sentence is about you.
- I can't keep up with

46:56.859 --> 46:58.527
what you want and don't want.

46:58.527 --> 47:02.281
You don't want to be a duchess,
and then you get mad if I get in the way?

47:02.781 --> 47:03.991
At least I know who I am.

47:03.991 --> 47:06.368
Well,
congratulations you've worked that out.

47:06.368 --> 47:09.037
Although, how awful it is
for you to have done all of that work

47:09.037 --> 47:12.082
to only realize
that you are an attention-seeking mess!

47:56.752 --> 47:57.753
I miss home.

47:59.588 --> 48:00.589
I'm sorry.

48:04.885 --> 48:06.345
I'm going home, actually.

48:08.931 --> 48:10.849
For a wedding that's already happened.

48:13.936 --> 48:15.354
I have to see my mother.

48:20.526 --> 48:22.945
Yet, not get to say a single thing
that I wanna say,

48:22.945 --> 48:25.656
because I have to tell her
that I'm not marrying a duke

48:27.115 --> 48:29.409
just because I couldn't keep a secret.

48:43.257 --> 48:44.883
You'll make a wonderful duchess.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.517
So you won't say anything?

48:55.602 --> 48:57.813
No. Why would I?

48:58.355 --> 49:00.482
Because he's your oldest friend.

49:02.192 --> 49:03.443
And you're my newest.

49:18.917 --> 49:20.544
I mean, it's hardly even late.

49:22.796 --> 49:25.424
We could just grab a bottle or something.

49:29.928 --> 49:31.972
You still left at Runnymede.

49:33.932 --> 49:34.933
You still left.

50:14.389 --> 50:16.683
I haven't even had a chance
to say goodbye to anyone.

50:16.683 --> 50:18.769
- Nan will think that I've--
- You will write to them.

50:33.450 --> 50:35.244
- There you are.
- Hi.

50:35.827 --> 50:37.287
Even my mother's gone to bed.

50:38.664 --> 50:40.040
Well, I'm not sleepy.

51:11.989 --> 51:12.906
Yes, please.

51:16.410 --> 51:17.995
I would very much like to marry you.

51:18.579 --> 51:19.580
Are you certain?

51:20.497 --> 51:25.169
When we first met, I didn't know
the whole truth about your context.

51:27.546 --> 51:29.548
But I always felt
that I knew the truth about you.

51:31.258 --> 51:33.260
And actually, you don't know
the full truth about my context,

51:33.260 --> 51:35.929
but love shouldn't be about all of that.
It shouldn't be about the extra stuff.

51:35.929 --> 51:37.014
It should just...

51:39.266 --> 51:40.767
It should just be about us.

51:43.854 --> 51:46.690
And we'll have all of this, won't we?
And the paintings.

51:46.690 --> 51:48.942
Well, maybe not mine,
but maybe I'll improve, right?

51:50.360 --> 51:52.237
But the most important thing is that...

51:54.364 --> 51:55.532
I'll have you.

51:56.700 --> 51:57.910
Yes, you will.

52:20.182 --> 52:24.811
But before any of the marrying,
or any of that,

52:24.811 --> 52:29.024
I need to go back to New York,
because my mother and I will need to talk.

52:31.026 --> 52:34.238
- But when I come back, then we can--
- May I come?

52:34.821 --> 52:38.033
Well, I'd like to see the skyscrapers
and walk in Central Park.

52:40.494 --> 52:43.622
But also, I should like to meet
your mother and your father.

52:44.206 --> 52:49.628
I shan't intrude.
I'd like to just... be nearby.

52:53.048 --> 52:54.716
To know who you really are.

53:19.908 --> 53:20.909
Nan,

53:22.452 --> 53:26.748
you know, we didn't all dance together,
but I shall still dance.

53:27.541 --> 53:29.293
On my own, if I must.

53:29.793 --> 53:31.920
I wish our whole lives
could be like Runnymede.

53:33.297 --> 53:34.298
I don't.

53:34.882 --> 53:38.010
I spent the whole night on the rooftop
with Guy Thwarte.

53:38.010 --> 53:39.761
Scared him till he ran away.

53:40.512 --> 53:41.889
You didn't scare him too much.

53:43.515 --> 53:47.436
He came back the next morning on a horse.

53:51.857 --> 53:52.858
Guy did?

53:54.234 --> 53:55.360
Yeah.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.905
You and Jinny were too busy
being proposed to

53:57.905 --> 54:00.115
and running around
not understanding about dukes,

54:00.115 --> 54:02.326
but yes, Guy Thwarte was absolutely there.

54:05.162 --> 54:08.165
I wish every night
could be like Runnymede for always.

54:09.249 --> 54:10.751
Good night, Duchess Nan.
