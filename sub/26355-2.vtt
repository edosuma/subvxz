Maybe I deserve to be
with someone who let me die.

19:34.928 --> 19:38.149
Maybe we deserve each other.

19:38.193 --> 19:40.586
It does seem like we're meant
for each other.

19:40.630 --> 19:44.242
I mean, gosh, maybe that's what
true marriage is...

19:44.286 --> 19:46.331
two people who want
each other to die.

19:46.375 --> 19:47.898
PETER [choking]:
Now you're getting it.

19:47.941 --> 19:50.466
So much beauty.

19:55.732 --> 19:57.690
Well, Brian,
I'm sorry that Jess died

19:57.734 --> 19:59.126
during the commercial break,

19:59.170 --> 20:01.390
but it was a very nice
funeral service.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.305
Yeah, it's sad.

20:03.348 --> 20:06.612
She was the love of my life,
my heart, my...

20:06.656 --> 20:07.700
ALPUCCINO MAKER:
Hoo-ah!

20:07.744 --> 20:10.834
I took that from her apartment.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.489
So, Chris, I hear
you been doing some vaping.

20:13.532 --> 20:14.751
So douchey.

20:14.794 --> 20:16.448
Mom, you told him?

20:16.492 --> 20:17.449
We had a deal.

20:17.493 --> 20:18.711
Thanks a lot, Peter.

20:18.755 --> 20:20.409
You promised
you wouldn't say anything.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.193
Oh, I'm supposed to keep
your secret

20:22.237 --> 20:24.195
after you lied to me
about sneaking cigarettes?

20:24.239 --> 20:26.545
What the hell, Chris?
You told him, too?

20:26.589 --> 20:28.721
-No, I didn't.
-Brian told me.

20:28.765 --> 20:31.376
Are you serious, Peter? You said
you wouldn't say anything.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.856
I promised Meg
I wouldn't tell anyone.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.075
Oh, good job with that, dick.

20:35.119 --> 20:36.860
Chris, the only reason
I told him

20:36.903 --> 20:38.514
was he promised he'd keep
his mouth shut.

20:38.557 --> 20:40.211
Oh, nice job, Chris.

20:40.255 --> 20:41.473
I should've known
not to trust someone

20:41.517 --> 20:43.083
who kisses his own brother.

20:43.127 --> 20:44.955
What? Wh-Who told you that?

20:44.998 --> 20:46.957
-Don't look at me.
-Meg told me.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.960
How does it feel, Meg,
you friggin' town crier?

20:50.003 --> 20:52.136
-MEG: You're such a bitch.
-PETER: She's a bitch?

20:52.179 --> 20:54.356
Meg, you said you
wouldn't tell Stewie's secret.

20:54.399 --> 20:55.661
CHRIS:
Stewie, you told Dad?

20:55.705 --> 20:57.315
STEWIE:
I had to get it off my chest.

20:57.359 --> 20:58.447
I didn't think
he'd understand me.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.145
PETER: I understand pieces
now and then.
