00:25.258 --> 00:26.793
You don't have to hold just on me,

00:26.794 --> 00:28.261
you know.
I'm not even in character.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.663
Just catch the atmosphere,
get the feeling.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.533
Feel the place. God, Mary.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.535
Get that tree, that's good.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.337
MARY: That?
Yeah, just get the tree.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.538
Why?
You got it?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.173
Because we have to film everything.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.741
I need atmosphere, all right?
I gotta get the setting.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.743
It's a desert.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.412
For God's sake.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.948
Feels hot.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.485
Wait until you see it.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.889
You are going to be amazed.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.696
<i>♪ We're gonna have a little party</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:10.469
<i>♪ And we got some
special people comin' ♪</i>

01:12.138 --> 01:14.539
Ready? Behold the gates.

01:16.142 --> 01:19.079
MARY:
Oh, my God, it's a dump.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.414
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.616
It's a hell of a lot
better than last time.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.057
Look, it's isolated, we got room
for everybody, it is perfect.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.955
Welcome home.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.065
FATHER SIMON: Mary?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.068
Mary?

01:47.207 --> 01:50.075
(GUNSHOTS)

02:29.516 --> 02:31.317
(GUNSHOT)

02:31.318 --> 02:33.078
FATHER SIMON: <i>What did
we do wrong last time?</i>

02:37.790 --> 02:39.759
If you'll recall,

02:39.760 --> 02:43.628
somebody got a little
antsy and lost control.

02:45.798 --> 02:46.865
(SHOOTS GUN)

02:51.337 --> 02:52.504
So this time

02:53.773 --> 02:55.907
let's streamline the plot.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.810
(SHOOTS GUN)

03:02.482 --> 03:04.383
FATHER SIMON:
No fuckin' around,

03:05.385 --> 03:07.787
no losing control.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.721
Let's keep it simple.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.625
Nobody gets antsy

03:17.263 --> 03:19.131
(SHOOTS GUN)

03:19.899 --> 03:21.700
and nobody gets away.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.577
FATHER SIMON: <i>Here, one box,
then we'll be ready to start.</i>

03:30.578 --> 03:32.077
Okay, get the camera ready.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.517
All right.

03:37.518 --> 03:41.287
Okay, you ready?
All right, frame me up. Okay.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.724
So, this is our church set.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.859
Crude, but simplistic.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.528
I've always been an admirer
of the Spartan approach.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.833
Clothes make the man.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.369
No seams on the sides,
bigger shoulder line.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.538
Short sleeves make
me look taller, right?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.007
Nice? Beautiful? Yeah.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.942
Uh...

04:02.943 --> 04:06.913
A few quasi-religious props.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.984
You need a central focus.
Pull their eyes here.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.786
Humans are so easily distracted.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.355
Keep your eye on the birdie,
right?

04:15.356 --> 04:19.024
(SHOUTS)

04:19.026 --> 04:20.326
(CHUCKLES)

04:20.327 --> 04:21.928
Didn't see that comin', did you?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.463
You can't just
dress like Superman

04:23.464 --> 04:25.265
and expect to
fuckin' fly, can you, huh?

04:25.266 --> 04:28.935
No, you can't.
You must have movement,
dynamic movement.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.670
Spread your arms wide. Kneel.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.973
Eyes straight ahead.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.977
Dynamic finger movement,
always slightly curled.
You see?

04:37.978 --> 04:41.948
The voice that I'm using right
now is clearly designed

04:41.949 --> 04:46.386
to make you, against all of
your better judgment like me.

04:46.387 --> 04:51.189
But you drop down the tone,
just ever so slightly.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.527
We face you.

04:54.528 --> 04:58.731
We speak to you with a
slightly halting cadence.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.668
Questioning, searching eyes.

05:01.669 --> 05:06.004
A quietly discomforting, although
caring, effect can be achieved.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.875
Do you see?

05:08.876 --> 05:14.580
Well then we get deep down in
fuck-you-in-the-ass territory.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.882
And that's a place
I like to be, baby.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.718
So here it is.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.088
This is our playroom.

05:25.725 --> 05:26.858
Let's play.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.732
Looks like I'm
heading to Mexico.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.004
I wanna share
something with you.

05:41.407 --> 05:45.143
This is the last thing I got from
my sister before she disappeared.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.616
"Dear El,

05:50.617 --> 05:53.419
"I wish you could
be here with me.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.856
"Every day is
a perfect experience.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.258
"Father Simon has shown me what
a beautiful person I really am.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.065
"I know you won't understand
this, but it's what I needed.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.133
"I feel like I am finally home.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.869
"Love, Janet."

06:13.039 --> 06:14.906
That is not my sister.

06:19.846 --> 06:24.751
I'm now about 200 Ks
south of the U.S. border.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.952
They said they'd
meet me here at noon.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.821
(VAN APPROACHING)

06:31.424 --> 06:32.691
ELLEN: Hey.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.126
MARY: Are you Ellen?

06:35.695 --> 06:36.761
Yeah.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.296
I'm Mary.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.599
Hop in.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.735
Guys, this is Ellen.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.003
Hey.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.604
Hey.
Hi.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.672
Hey.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.809
It's hot out there.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.144
Where are you from?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.150
London.
Oh.

06:57.151 --> 07:00.019
Like fish and chips
and stuff? (CHUCKLES)

07:00.020 --> 07:03.089
I've never left
the state before.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.690
Well, you're a long
way from home now.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.560
Yeah. Long way from home.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.228
Bye, home.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

08:00.112 --> 08:01.746
You must be Ellen.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.283
Welcome.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.153
It's good to be here.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.562
<i>Hi, my name is Simon Leach.</i>

08:16.563 --> 08:18.898
I'm 42 years old.
I'm from Alabama.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.166
And I love my new
life in his service.

08:23.903 --> 08:27.240
<i>My life was a mess</i>
<i>when he found me.</i>

08:27.241 --> 08:30.909
<i>I was just another lost soul looking
for meaning in the emptiness.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:33.712
<i>I drank and I drugged.</i>

08:33.714 --> 08:36.515
Slept with wayward women,

08:36.517 --> 08:39.116
lost myself in all kinds of
sinful distractions.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.788
<i>And then one day,</i>

08:42.789 --> 08:46.191
<i>in a moment of deep personal
darkness, he found me.</i>

08:47.627 --> 08:51.163
<i>I had blood on my hands,</i>
<i>hate in my heart,</i>

08:51.164 --> 08:52.497
<i>but he didn't judge me.</i>

08:53.966 --> 08:56.836
<i>He set my spirit free that day.</i>

08:56.837 --> 09:00.105
I promised him I'd do anything
I could to repay him.

09:15.955 --> 09:19.891
ELLEN: <i> Well, I finally</i>
<i>arrived at the compound.</i>

09:21.961 --> 09:23.928
Looks like this is
gonna be my new room.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.768
Not quite sure
who my roommate is yet though.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.783
FATHER SIMON: Hey, Mary.
Give me a little smile.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.988
That's my sunshine girl.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.912
Shit!
FATHER SIMON: Hey.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.846
Sorry.
What's with the camera?

10:19.051 --> 10:20.853
You settling in okay?

10:20.854 --> 10:21.988
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.122
FATHER SIMON: Need anything?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.856
No, I'm good.

10:32.264 --> 10:33.932
You have a really pretty face.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.600
You look good on camera.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.203
Thanks.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.447
FATHER SIMON:
Hey, we're glad you're here.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.211
Thanks.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.464
They've locked me up in this
room so I have time to reflect.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.567
Hold on.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.870
What is that?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.944
(FAINT SCREAMING)

11:20.780 --> 11:21.881
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

11:21.882 --> 11:23.014
Shit.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.690
Let me give you a little lesson

11:30.691 --> 11:31.991
in costume design.
Do you mind?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.994
MARY: Okay, go. Yeah.
Is it okay? Yeah?

11:34.995 --> 11:39.065
Earth tones, they
calm the brain. Neutrals.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.867
You'll always find priests and religious
figures wearing neutral tones.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.936
Whites.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.806
Look at altars, you'll
find soft neutral tones.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.009
Bright colors excite the mind
and we don't want that.

11:50.010 --> 11:54.480
So we've got an array of neutral
tones, of sands and whites.

11:54.481 --> 11:58.217
What do you think? Hold on.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.087
What do you think?
Wait, this is kind of
a western vibe here.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.354
It's very friendly.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.156
Hi, I'm Father Simon.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.025
I'm glad you're here.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.493
Tell me a little about yourself.
What do you think?

12:09.795 --> 12:10.863
MARY: No.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.064
No?
No.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.899
Fine. Okay.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.600
What do you think?
What do you think?

12:17.903 --> 12:19.939
Nice? Yeah?
Yeah.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.941
Hey, welcome.
Where are you from?
Tell me about your family.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.142
Who gives a fuck?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.745
(LAUGHS)

12:25.746 --> 12:27.679
No, but seriously,
tell me about yourself.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.249
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.884
MARY: Yeah.

12:31.885 --> 12:32.985
Yeah? Button-down?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.220
MARY: Try the last one.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.421
I don't like that color.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.123
Damn, woman.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.891
All right, what do you see?
What do you like?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.760
Yeah, I like that one.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.894
FATHER SIMON: Hi.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.961
Welcome.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.099
I wanna tell you
that I care about you.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.500
Don't tell any of
the other children this, but

12:50.503 --> 12:52.236
you're probably my favorite.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.506
I love you.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.878
I love you.

12:58.879 --> 13:04.150
FATHER SIMON: This is the next in a series
of entrance interviews with Sister Tracy.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.117
Entrance interview
with Brother Alan.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.554
Brother Ben.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.990
Robin.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.959
Entrance interview,
Brother Brian.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
Entrance interview,
Brother Frank.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.497
Entrance interview,
Sister Grace.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.569
Veronica.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.106
Welcome, Sister.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.340
Thank you, Father.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.375
We're glad you're here.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.976
I'm really glad to be here.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.113
The purpose of the interview is

13:34.114 --> 13:37.016
for you to let people
know why you're here,

13:37.017 --> 13:40.151
how you came to be here, and
how you feel about being here.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.686
Okay.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.091
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

13:46.092 --> 13:48.093
<i>Are you willing to be completely
and totally honest with me?</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:49.228
About everything?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.362
Yeah.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.331
'Cause like, I didn't have...

13:52.332 --> 13:57.002
Because I didn't have anywhere
else to go, I guess and I...

13:57.003 --> 13:58.504
Um...

13:58.505 --> 14:03.976
<i>'Cause everything else</i>
<i>was really bad and I...</i>

14:03.977 --> 14:05.578
Hey, Alan, what...
What was bad?

14:05.579 --> 14:07.613
You say things were bad,
everything was bad.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.647
What was bad?
I don't know.

14:10.449 --> 14:11.816
You'd run away, hadn't you?

14:14.453 --> 14:16.154
You'd run away from home?

14:19.158 --> 14:20.691
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

14:25.497 --> 14:29.500
I couldn't live there anymore.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.872
Um... More physically...

14:32.873 --> 14:34.705
Did you have sex with him?

14:35.975 --> 14:37.243
I did.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.443
How old were you?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.212
Seventeen.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.914
How old was he?

14:41.915 --> 14:44.083
Forty-four.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.751
FATHER SIMON: <i> What is a man?</i>
<i>What's a man to you?</i>

14:52.491 --> 14:56.662
A man's strong and he's able to

14:56.663 --> 14:59.130
take care of himself and

15:01.367 --> 15:04.503
he's not
a failure in life and...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.972
You think you're a failure?

15:06.973 --> 15:10.109
BEN:
<i>But as I got older, the</i>

15:10.110 --> 15:12.643
<i>drinking got worse and</i>

15:16.048 --> 15:17.782
it became drinking and

15:19.051 --> 15:20.651
beating and

15:21.587 --> 15:23.989
fucking and

15:23.990 --> 15:25.958
drinking and
beating and fucking,

15:25.959 --> 15:27.326
and drinking and
beating and fucking,

15:27.327 --> 15:28.627
and drinking and
beating and fucking.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.396
I didn't leave a family.

15:30.397 --> 15:34.066
I left a woman and a man

15:56.622 --> 15:57.688
I...

16:00.259 --> 16:02.660
I lost someone really close
to me a while ago.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.329
FATHER SIMON: I'm sorry.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.533
And I...

16:11.270 --> 16:13.204
I kind of pushed everyone away.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.142
FATHER SIMON: As you can see,
we don't have much.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.179
But I'll tell you what,
we make do.

16:20.180 --> 16:24.383
And here's some of our
children doing their laundry.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.518
Hey, Brother Ben. How are you?
What do you got there?

16:29.121 --> 16:30.521
Got your laundry there?

16:33.192 --> 16:34.792
Looks good, nice and clean.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.196
All right, carry on, Brother.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.335
We have Sister Grace,
Sister Ellen.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.336
Hi, Father Simon.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.542
Better be careful in there,
you might get a tidal wave.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.596
It's really not what I expected.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.798

17:52.205 --> 17:54.573
Hi, Father Simon.
Father Simon.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.141
So we're gonna
have a camera chat

17:56.142 --> 17:58.444
and we're gonna find out
about what you're doing

17:58.445 --> 18:03.248
and tell everybody what we
do here, Sister Veronica.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.784
With your sweet smile.
And your nice dancing eyes.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.320
Are you Irish?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.855
Yeah, I am.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.324
You look like you got
some Irish in you there.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.425
Why don't you tell the people
what you're doing?

18:15.327 --> 18:18.462
We're sewing our caftans.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.700
To be ready for our transition.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.769
And each of
the children got to choose

18:23.770 --> 18:25.671
their own
pattern for the caftan.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.406
Right? Yeah?
That's right. Yes.

18:27.407 --> 18:31.443
So I'm guessing
yours is stylish?

18:31.444 --> 18:34.513
I don't know what it's gonna turn out like.
It's not that good.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.381
It's gonna be great, yeah.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.450
Thank you, Father Simon.

18:38.451 --> 18:42.421
It's really great being here

18:42.422 --> 18:45.457
because everyone is
really nice to me.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.793
Father Simon is...

18:47.794 --> 18:50.262
Just makes me feel at home

18:50.263 --> 18:54.666
and everyone else makes me feel
like I'm part of a family.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.401
FATHER SIMON: You are at home
and you are part of the family.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.806

Seamstress Robin.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.775

19:03.776 --> 19:08.780
She probably knows
the size of needles to use.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.617
If I had a sewing
machine for you, I bet you

19:11.618 --> 19:12.918
could just crank out
all kinds of things.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.319
I wish.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.221
This is good, though.

19:16.222 --> 19:19.591
These needles are good for
getting through the fabric.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.727
You probably wouldn't mind
sewing everyone's caftan.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.462
(LAUGHING)

19:23.463 --> 19:25.397
Well, but then they wouldn't
each be different.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.932
They'd all be the same.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.402
And that's just
a little part of the lesson,

19:30.403 --> 19:34.640
preparing your own caftans
because I prepared my own.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.944
We're family and each family
member has a responsibility

19:38.945 --> 19:42.414
and we work together
all for the common good.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.350
I am an idealist at heart

19:45.351 --> 19:49.221

enough even at this age to

believe that it's possible to
work together for something good.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.964
FATHER SIMON:
All right, Grace.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.170
It always sticks.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.875
GRACE: Okay.

29:36.876 --> 29:37.741
(CHUCKLING)

29:48.486 --> 29:50.421
FATHER SIMON:
Who loves chore wheel day?

29:50.422 --> 29:54.559
(GROUP CHEERS FEEBLY)

29:54.560 --> 29:57.228
FATHER SIMON: All right, guys, on the
count of three, we're all gonna get up

29:57.229 --> 30:01.099
we're gonna go do our chores and
work hard because we're a family.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.367
Who loves you?

30:02.368 --> 30:03.968
GROUP: Father Simon.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.570
FATHER SIMON:
I love my children.

30:05.571 --> 30:09.473
Do what the chore
wheel told you! Let's go!

30:10.842 --> 30:12.709
Yeah. All right, let's go.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.985
MAN:
Come on, hustle, hustle.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.021
Tracy, I can catch.
MAN: There we go.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.742
It's okay. I got it.
MAN: Good job there, T.

30:31.863 --> 30:32.964
WOMAN: Go get it.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.665
MAN:
Keep going. Keep going. Run.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.800
FATHER SIMON: I just wanna know
your thoughts and impressions.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.498
Um...

31:09.567 --> 31:13.570
I guess everyone
seems really nice.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.506
<i>It's peaceful.</i>

31:19.444 --> 31:22.145
<i>It seems like you have a nice</i>
<i>group of people around you.</i>

31:26.384 --> 31:27.651
<i>That's my first impression.</i>

31:30.521 --> 31:32.589
Where's that picture from?

31:33.658 --> 31:34.791
The waterfall.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.095
Have you been out
to the desert before?

31:38.263 --> 31:39.530
Yes.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.598
Yeah. Pretty out here.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.235
FATHER SIMON:
<i>I love what I do.</i>

31:47.639 --> 31:51.910
<i>And I hope maybe in some small
way it can be of some help,</i>

31:51.911 --> 31:53.877
<i>help you find whatever it is</i>
<i>you're searching for.</i>

31:57.048 --> 31:59.450
Anything you'd like to tell
people who might be watching this

31:59.451 --> 32:03.121
about our little
piece of paradise?

32:03.122 --> 32:04.788
Who's gonna be watching it?

32:32.083 --> 32:33.783
FATHER SIMON:
I think that's yours.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.723
How's it work?

32:44.696 --> 32:45.762
Um...

32:48.666 --> 32:49.968
You turn it on.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.234
Yeah?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.684
Can you zoom?

33:06.685 --> 33:08.218
Yeah, it's zoomed in.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.588
How's the mike on that thing?

33:12.256 --> 33:13.591
It's all right.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.325
I haven't used one before.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.564
Good memory?
Record a lot of stuff?

33:23.101 --> 33:24.435
Not bad.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.702
That's handy. That's good.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.774
FATHER SIMON: I need one.

33:37.115 --> 33:37.981
Here.

33:40.284 --> 33:41.685
No, that's yours.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.659
That's a thing that gives
the lie to all the trust

33:48.660 --> 33:50.061
that we've been
trying to build up here.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.328
Simon.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.568
Have I done anything
to indicate or show you

33:57.569 --> 33:59.170
that I was trying to hurt you?

33:59.171 --> 34:02.373
Have I done anything
to earn the distrust?

34:02.374 --> 34:05.242
I need to know... I need to
know what happened to Janet.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.946
I need to know.
I need to know why she died.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.724
You weren't truthful with me,
but I'll be truthful with you.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.791
She died because of you.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.029
That's not true.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.538
We shared
everything with each other.

34:33.539 --> 34:36.672
Did you?
Did you know she
tried to kill herself?

34:37.608 --> 34:40.143
You're lying.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.646
Right after her husband left
and took the kids.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.815
No, she was depressed
and we talked about it.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.484
She stopped drinking
and she went to therapy.

34:46.485 --> 34:50.621
Now that I did know.
That helped for a while.

34:50.621 --> 34:51.688
For a while.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.362
She was so lonely.

35:00.298 --> 35:01.831
Poor Janet.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.536
But that all changed
the day she found our website.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.541
She told me that was the day

35:10.542 --> 35:13.877
she felt she was finally able to
connect with someone, really connect.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.885
She confessed her sins.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.691
The next day she
moved into our church.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.829
Would you like to
know how she died?

35:34.165 --> 35:35.832
What happened?

35:37.168 --> 35:39.437
We were fine.

35:39.438 --> 35:42.840
Everything was fine until stories
began to appear in the...

35:42.841 --> 35:44.441
Stories that were true.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.679
Lies.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.581
The same thing that always happens
when people come across something

35:50.582 --> 35:52.683
they don't
understand and they need

35:52.684 --> 35:54.517
an easy answer to
explain it away.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.290
And when the lies came,
the police came.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.691
That's what brought
the police to our door.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.627
So why did you shoot at them?

36:02.628 --> 36:06.497
We didn't.
They came in shooting.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.366
We tried to hide in the main room.
They burned us out.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.903
She saved my life.

36:18.709 --> 36:19.911
She was proud of you.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.779
No, she wasn't.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.848
She always talked about you.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.582
Her beautiful sister.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.451
She was so proud of you.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.322
She was happy, Ellen.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.789
She was happy.

36:38.796 --> 36:40.698
Look, I'm sorry I made you
cry, but now you understand

36:40.699 --> 36:43.367
why we tape
everything around here.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.236
Because people don't understand,

36:45.237 --> 36:46.870
because people
get the wrong ideas.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.376
And I'll be damned if I will
let any one of my followers

36:52.377 --> 36:55.913
ever be hurt by anybody.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.915
I want people to know
that we weren't monsters.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.798
I'm sorry I lied to you.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.611
In my hand

37:26.612 --> 37:28.144
I hold a recipe.

37:29.547 --> 37:31.748
It's a recipe for distrust.

37:32.383 --> 37:35.185
It's a recipe for fear.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.723
It's a recipe for hatred.
You know what it is?

37:38.724 --> 37:39.824
ALAN: What is it?

37:39.825 --> 37:41.859
It's love.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.328
"Simon,
there's no love on the plate.

37:44.329 --> 37:47.798
"There's nothing but pens and papers.
There's no love there."

37:47.799 --> 37:50.635
There will be.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.637
'Cause we're each gonna
take a slip of this paper

37:52.638 --> 37:54.998
and we're gonna write something
about the person next to us.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.644
All right.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.712
Can everybody write?
'Cause I didn't ask that.

38:01.713 --> 38:05.983
You never know.
Just wanna make sure, right?

38:05.984 --> 38:08.986
Which way do we go?
This way or this way?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.656
I haven't decided that.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.526
Evan, if we will just wait for
instructions, then we will find out

38:15.527 --> 38:17.361
the way things are done
instead of jumping ahead.

38:17.362 --> 38:19.530
That's good, Father Simon.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.899
Here we are.
I know it's good because I said it.

38:21.900 --> 38:26.003
All right. Everybody write
something loving and affirming.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.938
I'm gonna join in, too.
I will write about

38:29.740 --> 38:31.876
Brother Brian.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.477
You will write
about Brother Frank.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.779
Who will write
about Sister Tracy.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.414
Who'll write
about Sister Veronica

38:36.415 --> 38:37.682
who will write
about Brother Ben,

38:37.683 --> 38:38.916
who will write
about Sister Ellen

38:38.917 --> 38:40.250
who will write
about Brother Alan.

38:44.555 --> 38:46.022
Time's almost up.

38:48.392 --> 38:49.659
All right.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.227
Let's begin.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.765
Brother.

38:56.967 --> 38:58.836
Read.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.803
Stand and read
for us, would you?

39:03.574 --> 39:06.776
"Brother Brian sings like a bird.
He also has nice eyes."

39:07.712 --> 39:08.879
It's true.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.947
MAN: Yes.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.016
BRIAN: Thank you,
Father Simon.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.752
"Brother Frank is the most
amazing kickball player."

39:18.389 --> 39:19.722
Stand up.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.961
(GIGGLES)

39:23.962 --> 39:27.898
"Sister Tracy has the sweetest smile.
It lights up the whole place."

39:27.899 --> 39:29.900
FATHER SIMON: How nice!

39:29.901 --> 39:33.637
"You are helpful and handy.
I love your birdhouse."

39:33.638 --> 39:35.305
TRACY: It's really pretty.

39:38.642 --> 39:43.147
"Brother Ben, you are so loving
and kind, so considerate.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.814
"I love you."

39:45.049 --> 39:46.716
I love you, too.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.789
"You are so warm
that when you finally came,

39:51.790 --> 39:54.057
"our family felt complete."

39:55.393 --> 39:57.528
Thank you.

39:57.529 --> 40:01.165
"Brother Alan has
a beautiful smile."

40:01.166 --> 40:03.199
And there's a smiley face.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.641
"Brother Evan has nice eyes
and doesn't judge me."

40:17.848 --> 40:18.983
EVAN: There it is.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.917
Sister?

40:22.119 --> 40:23.653
Father Simon.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.660
"Father Simon,

40:29.661 --> 40:32.829
"the most powerful man who
gives us strength and love."

40:34.064 --> 40:37.201
I wish it were true,
but I'm not powerful at all.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.202
I'm a very weak man.

40:41.071 --> 40:42.405
But with love,

40:43.140 --> 40:44.708
all things are possible.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.445
And with love, we are strong.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.046
And with love, we are family.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.554
FATHER SIMON: <i>You know, when you
came in, you didn't smile much</i>

40:56.555 --> 40:58.821
and now you smile a lot.

40:59.557 --> 41:00.991
I know.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.560
I'm glad to see it.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.627
It's because of you,
Father Simon.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.162
Thank you.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.829
No. Thank you.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.067
FATHER SIMON: Have you ever
thought about what you would say

41:10.068 --> 41:13.471
if you could say something to

41:13.472 --> 41:15.573
those who might be left behind
when you leave the earth?

41:15.574 --> 41:17.208
Have you thought about it?
Yes, Father.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.010
I guess everybody has.
I guess it's just human.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.213
I know I have.

41:22.214 --> 41:24.248
And I think the great
thing about our family

41:24.249 --> 41:26.750
is we have
the opportunity to do it.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.818
Because we're going
to a better place.

41:31.755 --> 41:32.822
(SOBS)

41:33.791 --> 41:36.260
It's hard.

41:36.261 --> 41:40.329
Because I've always been taught
to keep my feelings in check.

41:42.666 --> 41:46.069
But I feel free with you.

41:47.605 --> 41:50.140
I've never been more welcomed

41:50.141 --> 41:54.678
into a group of
strangers in my entire life.

41:54.679 --> 41:59.683
<i>I was around people for over
20 years in my hometown that</i>

41:59.684 --> 42:02.753
didn't give a damn
whether I lived or died.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.822
I don't know that I've
done right by this world

42:07.224 --> 42:09.826
and I think I could
do better in the next.

42:11.662 --> 42:14.464
But I wanna please you.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.102
I'm scared, nervous.

42:18.103 --> 42:21.037
It's good,
it's a good scared-nervous.

42:24.742 --> 42:27.477
It's not that hard, you just
gotta have the balls to do it.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.683
I mean,
if you think you're happy

42:32.684 --> 42:35.119
like with, with your family
and like, working your job

42:35.120 --> 42:37.121
and like, going to school,
you're wrong.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.290
You guys, you're all wrong.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.224
And this is the best ever.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.630
This family, this group,

42:46.631 --> 42:49.098
has taken me in and
become my new family.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.071
ELLEN: <i>I guess I don't really
know what I'm looking for,</i>

42:54.072 --> 42:56.305
but I hope I find it here.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.008
FATHER SIMON:
I hope so, too.

43:06.951 --> 43:08.285
And when I

43:08.286 --> 43:10.119
see my father

43:11.288 --> 43:13.523
and show him who I've become,

43:16.126 --> 43:17.794
I'm good now.

43:24.068 --> 43:25.935
I don't know what else to say.

43:27.638 --> 43:30.040
FATHER SIMON:
<i>It's a surprise for someone.</i>

43:30.041 --> 43:32.109
It's a surprise for someone.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.744
What's going on?

43:33.745 --> 43:35.079
It's a surprise for someone.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.915
What's going on?
What's going on?

43:37.916 --> 43:41.384
GROUP: Happy birthday!

43:45.089 --> 43:46.556
Yes!

43:49.960 --> 43:51.729
FATHER SIMON:
Each one of these candles

43:51.730 --> 43:54.564
represents someone in
your life who's hurt you,

43:55.366 --> 43:57.368
someone who's let you down,

43:57.369 --> 43:59.336
someone who's been mean to you,

43:59.337 --> 44:01.938
someone outside of the family.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.106
With all of your might

44:05.309 --> 44:06.909
blow their lives away.

44:11.682 --> 44:13.082
All dead!

44:51.755 --> 44:52.923
MARY: Simon.

44:52.924 --> 44:55.426
Not now, Mary.

44:55.427 --> 44:57.159
FATHER SIMON:
So what's going on with you?

44:59.229 --> 45:00.464
ALAN: Nothin'.

45:00.465 --> 45:04.000
No, everything's good.

45:06.970 --> 45:10.907
Now, just between you and me and the
camera, is anything bothering you?

45:13.243 --> 45:14.278
You like being here?

45:14.279 --> 45:17.147
Yeah. Yeah, I love it.

45:17.148 --> 45:18.982
It's great.

45:18.983 --> 45:22.119
Yeah, I really...
I really like it.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.986
You making friends?
Yeah.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.255
All the kids?
Yeah.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.125
Yeah.

45:28.126 --> 45:30.260
Friends with Grace and...

45:30.261 --> 45:31.627
Ellen?
Yeah.

45:32.463 --> 45:33.797
Evan?

45:33.798 --> 45:35.097
Yeah.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.068
Yeah.
Yeah.

45:41.171 --> 45:43.440
<i>And then, I just went for it.</i>

45:43.441 --> 45:44.875
You know, I just...

45:44.876 --> 45:46.110
FATHER SIMON: What do you mean?
What'd you do?

45:46.111 --> 45:48.045
Well, I kissed him.
Yeah.

45:48.046 --> 45:49.379
And then I just
leaned in and kissed him.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.181
Did he kiss you back?
Hmm?

45:51.182 --> 45:52.648
Did he kiss you back?

46:11.401 --> 46:12.503
Now.

46:12.504 --> 46:14.403
(SOBBING)

46:16.140 --> 46:17.474
I'm sorry!

46:17.475 --> 46:21.010
I'm sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!

46:38.128 --> 46:40.429
(INAUDIBLE)

47:09.993 --> 47:11.727
EVAN:
Do we have to film this?

47:14.131 --> 47:15.566
Would it make you
more comfortable

47:15.567 --> 47:18.001
if we turned
the camera to the wall?

47:18.002 --> 47:20.102
If you wouldn't mind, Father?

47:38.155 --> 47:40.823
(WOMEN CHATTING)

47:46.063 --> 47:49.132
FATHER SIMON: <i>Now wait a minute.
I find this hard to believe.</i>

47:49.133 --> 47:50.666
You never had a boyfriend?

47:53.937 --> 47:54.804
(STAMMERS)

47:57.007 --> 47:59.675
I mean,
I could be your boyfriend.

48:01.411 --> 48:03.279
That'd be creepy.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.747
Why?

48:06.450 --> 48:10.119
Because you're my father.
You can't be both.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.690
What if I told you
that I can do anything I want?

48:20.564 --> 48:23.866
FATHER SIMON: Here we have two of
my children in an intimate moment.

48:30.007 --> 48:31.607
What do you see in front of you?

48:36.947 --> 48:38.348
ALAN: A girl.

48:38.349 --> 48:39.616
FATHER SIMON: What's her name?

48:39.617 --> 48:40.883
ALAN: Robin.

48:42.552 --> 48:43.886
FATHER SIMON:
What's her purpose?

48:45.689 --> 48:48.225
ALAN: I don't know.

48:48.226 --> 48:51.094
FATHER SIMON: Her purpose is to serve
you, son, because you're a man.

48:51.095 --> 48:52.362
Do you hear me?
Do you understand?

48:52.363 --> 48:54.164
ALAN: Okay.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.966
FATHER SIMON:
And at this moment,

48:55.967 --> 48:58.568
you're looking at your
property and your playground.

48:58.569 --> 49:02.039
A thing of beauty and delicacy.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.473
Put your hands on
your property, son.

49:04.942 --> 49:05.808
Do it.

49:06.576 --> 49:07.644
Do it. Do it now.

49:07.645 --> 49:08.712
ALAN: I don't know how.

49:08.713 --> 49:09.778
Okay.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.051
FATHER SIMON:
Is that the way you handle property?

49:14.052 --> 49:15.252
I don't know.

49:15.253 --> 49:16.353
Touch her.

49:16.354 --> 49:17.620
Higher.

49:17.721 --> 49:19.623
Higher.

49:19.624 --> 49:22.025
You know where to go.
Do it. Touch 'em.

49:22.026 --> 49:23.193
Put your hand on the other one.

49:23.194 --> 49:24.460
ALAN: Okay.

49:25.362 --> 49:26.430
I'm sorry.

49:26.431 --> 49:27.763
FATHER SIMON: Good. Just feel.

49:29.499 --> 49:31.233
Robin, how does it feel?

49:32.302 --> 49:33.936
Don't lie.

49:35.038 --> 49:36.406
How does it feel?

49:36.407 --> 49:37.907
It doesn't feel like anything.

49:38.442 --> 49:39.977
I'm sorry.

49:39.978 --> 49:44.715
Because Alan doesn't yet know
how to appreciate a woman.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.183
But he will.

49:46.184 --> 49:47.449
Kiss her.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.486
Kiss her, Alan.

49:54.257 --> 49:56.192
The other way, I can't see you.

49:57.494 --> 49:58.894
Kiss her.

50:01.031 --> 50:03.151
You're not kissing your goddamn
grandmother, kiss her.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.514
ELLEN:
<i>Something's changed</i>

50:17.515 --> 50:19.782
<i>and everyone's acting scared,</i>

50:20.784 --> 50:23.653
<i>but they won't</i>
<i>tell me what's what.</i>

50:23.654 --> 50:25.722
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe they don't even know.</i>

50:25.723 --> 50:28.657
<i>Things just...</i>
<i>They feel heavier.</i>

50:30.293 --> 50:32.329
<i>Simon and Mary keep disappearing
for long hours at a time</i>

50:32.330 --> 50:35.431
<i>and when they get back, they run
us through even crazier drills.</i>

50:35.632 --> 50:38.300
(SHOUTING)

50:41.738 --> 50:44.508
It's getting harder to focus.

50:44.509 --> 50:46.709
<i>They're not</i>
<i>letting us sleep anymore.</i>

50:55.318 --> 50:57.320
FATHER SIMON:
<i>I wanna talk now.</i>

50:57.321 --> 51:00.824
<i>I'd like to talk about music.</i>

51:00.825 --> 51:03.292
<i>And the power that music
has to change people.</i>

51:05.362 --> 51:06.895
Some people.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.801
<i>The song</i> Amazing Grace,
<i>I've heard a million times.</i>

51:14.671 --> 51:16.805
<i>I heard it growing up in church.</i>

51:19.276 --> 51:21.778
I was a pretty bad kid.

51:21.779 --> 51:23.779
I didn't listen to
that stuff, you know?

51:26.316 --> 51:28.384
<i>Then one day that song came up</i>
<i>and it hit me</i>

51:29.453 --> 51:31.520
square in the face.

51:34.257 --> 51:36.693
I was in County, again,

51:36.694 --> 51:39.663
<i>trying to lower my points,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

51:39.664 --> 51:45.567
<i>Bullshit motherfucking
say-no-to-drugs meetings they had.</i>

51:47.437 --> 51:49.406
God.

51:49.407 --> 51:51.807
Sweet Jesus, it was boring.

51:52.776 --> 51:55.112
You know the routine.

51:55.113 --> 51:57.180
Some fat motherfucker gets up

51:57.181 --> 51:59.549
starts talking about how doing
blow made him suck dick.

51:59.550 --> 52:02.017
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

52:13.463 --> 52:17.567
<i>Then he starts</i>
<i>talkin' about that song.</i>

52:17.568 --> 52:20.537
About how it changed him, you know.
He was blind but now he sees.

52:20.538 --> 52:23.072
You know, blah, blah, blah,
I'm about half-listening.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.510
<i>Then he starts to sing.</i>

52:29.613 --> 52:31.680
<i>♪ Amazing Grace</i>

52:33.483 --> 52:35.951
<i>♪ How sweet the sound ♪</i>

52:43.460 --> 52:45.395
<i>He sung like an angel.</i>

52:45.396 --> 52:46.895
<i>Just like an angel.</i>

52:48.932 --> 52:51.801
So I figured

52:51.802 --> 52:54.204
"Hell,

52:54.205 --> 52:56.872
"if <i> Amazing Grace</i> could make
that fat fuck beautiful,

53:00.277 --> 53:03.078
"maybe it can do something
for the likes of me."

53:32.809 --> 53:33.876
(INAUDIBLE)

54:29.032 --> 54:30.499
(EXCLAIMS)

55:02.365 --> 55:04.766
BRIAN:
<i>We were six when we first met.</i>

55:08.004 --> 55:09.605
She was my best friend.

55:14.344 --> 55:17.079
I think we knew even back then
we were gonna get married.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.488
She got pregnant.

55:25.489 --> 55:27.222
We were only 17.

55:27.924 --> 55:28.991
But...

55:31.328 --> 55:32.861
we weren't worried.

55:33.930 --> 55:35.898
We knew we'd make it work.

55:38.535 --> 55:40.670
She died.

55:40.671 --> 55:43.073
FATHER SIMON:
What happened?

55:43.074 --> 55:45.574
The baby cut off
her blood supply.

55:46.409 --> 55:47.976
What about the baby?

55:53.083 --> 55:56.086
Why would anyone blame you?

55:56.087 --> 55:58.220
It's my fault she got pregnant.

55:59.723 --> 56:02.858
And were they right?
Was it your fault?

56:07.097 --> 56:09.097
You think it was lust or love?

56:11.601 --> 56:13.136
It was love.

56:13.137 --> 56:14.937
You sure you
know the difference?

56:17.941 --> 56:19.641
Yes, Father.

56:20.410 --> 56:22.678
What are you afraid of? Most?

56:24.080 --> 56:25.847
Most of all?

56:26.483 --> 56:27.983
Don't lie.

56:31.154 --> 56:33.021
That I won't get
to see her again.

56:44.501 --> 56:45.834
Good.

56:52.041 --> 56:53.308
(EXCLAIMS)

56:56.479 --> 56:58.080
Let's talk about Mama.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.752
Mama didn't give
a shit about me.

57:04.621 --> 57:07.891
Or what happened to me.

57:07.892 --> 57:11.094
So I got in trouble real early
and real often, you know.

57:11.095 --> 57:14.497
<i>Petty theft, stole</i>
<i>some cars, shit like that.</i>

57:14.498 --> 57:16.632
<i>And I got caught a lot.</i>

57:18.768 --> 57:21.069
<i>She didn't do shit</i>
<i>to get me outta there.</i>

57:22.439 --> 57:24.174
<i>So I stayed.</i>

57:24.175 --> 57:25.909
And I didn't care.

57:25.910 --> 57:27.544
At least in there
the hot water worked.

57:27.545 --> 57:29.311
You know,
I got something to eat.

57:30.847 --> 57:33.149
God,
you see some things, though.

57:33.150 --> 57:36.553
Back up, baby,
let me show you something.

57:36.554 --> 57:39.688
The first time I saw a man
take another man's life,

57:41.491 --> 57:44.960
he stabbed him in
the eyeball for an orange.

57:45.829 --> 57:47.963
<i>A fuckin' orange.</i>

57:49.466 --> 57:50.899
I mean, fuck!

57:58.041 --> 57:59.576
FATHER SIMON:
<i>You don't getnothing for free in life.</i>

57:59.577 --> 58:04.813
<i>There's always somebody who wants
to get fucked or fuck you.</i>

58:09.052 --> 58:12.254
That's the only thing she ever
did say that made any sense.

58:15.692 --> 58:17.993
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>she'd think of me now.</i>

58:30.640 --> 58:32.509
Fuck you, Mama!

58:32.510 --> 58:33.842
Fuck you!

58:36.112 --> 58:37.379
Turn it off.

58:39.782 --> 58:41.751
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Just being in this world?</i>

58:41.752 --> 58:44.254
<i>I'm here to tell you it
doesn't have to be that way.</i>

58:44.255 --> 58:47.155
You can call it what you will,
I call it a transition.

58:48.258 --> 58:50.927
But it's a change,
brothers and sisters.

58:50.928 --> 58:52.461
It's a change.

58:53.596 --> 58:55.363
And it's a hard way

58:56.699 --> 58:59.569
and I can't make you choose it.

58:59.570 --> 59:01.971
And if there's anyone
in this room right now

59:01.972 --> 59:04.173
if there's anyone
under the sound of my voice

59:04.174 --> 59:07.176
who feels that this
way is not for them,

59:07.177 --> 59:09.779
I wish, I beg,

59:09.780 --> 59:13.982
I plead for them to stand up
and walk out that door.

59:15.184 --> 59:17.854
And I swear to you
upon my honor as a man

59:17.855 --> 59:19.955
that you will not be stopped.

59:21.190 --> 59:24.459
I will turn my
back and I will wait.

59:26.195 --> 59:28.396
If you must leave, leave.

59:34.137 --> 59:35.470
Very well.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.875
Who's ready to feel that moment?

59:38.876 --> 59:40.176
I am ready, Father.
I'm ready.

59:40.177 --> 59:41.678
Who's ready to feel that power?

59:41.679 --> 59:43.311
I'm ready, Father.

59:45.181 --> 59:46.783
Brother Evan.
Yes?

59:46.784 --> 59:48.784
He tells me it is your time.

59:50.186 --> 59:51.887
Oh, my God.

59:59.729 --> 01:00:00.929
Thank you, Father.

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.465
Celebrate with your brother.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.604
I love you! I love you!

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:10.273
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Exit interview, Brother Evan.</i>

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.208
EVAN: <i> Hi.</i>
<i>Hi, Brother.</i>

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.611
FATHER SIMON: This is a great
opportunity for you

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:18.781
to tell those who may
watch this in the future

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.117
what you're feeling,
what you'd like them to know.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.995
This is it.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:36.331
<i>This is the only</i>
<i>holy place on earth.</i>

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:40.937
<i>I feel sad for you</i>

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:44.005
<i>because you will never experience
what we are experiencing.</i>

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.610
We only live once.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.346
We only have one shot.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.616
And this is it.

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.422
GROUP: <i> Yes, Father.</i>

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:01.257
FATHER SIMON:
<i>This is a moment of joy</i>

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.193
for all of the family.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.862
We will soon be
reunited in our new home.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.104
Give me the camera.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:20.609
Now, now.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.453

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.182
FATHER SIMON: Perfect.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:05.954
Absolutely perfect.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:13.556
FATHER SIMON: Yesterday you saw
Brother Evan transition.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:14.622
Yeah.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.227
What was that like?

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:19.427
I don't know.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.765
Yesterday,

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.237
I got to witness

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:32.707
the most beautiful thing I have
ever seen in my entire life.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:37.145
I was really happy.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:42.517
I knew that Brother Evan was

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.789
in a better place,
a place I wanted to be in.

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.328
Who's this guy?

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.501
The truck?
Yeah.

01:03:58.502 --> 01:03:59.768
Yeah.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.505
You like trucks?
Yeah, I do.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.473
I've always liked trucks.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.574
Yeah. Yeah, they're strong.

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:11.212
Do you want to talk about
Brother Evan's transition?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.782
(GRUNTS)

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:18.319
Why don't you just
tell us what it was like?

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:24.559
I don't know why,
I felt confused.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.661
Confused about what?

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.266
I didn't want him to be in pain.

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.638
Don't you find
that hard to watch?

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.511
If it troubles you,
why didn't you stop it?

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.418
I've asked myself that
and I don't know why.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.589
Should I have stopped it?

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.349
ELLEN: <i> I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm doing here anymore.</i>

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.768
<i>He was right.</i>

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.141
She was alone.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.413
And I was too busy all the time.

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.216
(SOBS)

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.488
<i>I didn't listen to her.</i>

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:31.227
<i>Not at all.</i>

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.428
<i>She would try and tell me things</i>

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.801
and I know it's too
late for her, but...

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.775
<i>I decided to</i>
<i>stay and help Leach.</i>

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.815
If he made her feel better,
maybe he'll do the same for me.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:01.689

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.771
I'm ready.

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:19.607
You sure?

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.776
Yes, Father.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.181
I wanna feel what she felt.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:29.851
You're unhappy, aren't you?

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.298

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:51.507
has expelled the fear in her
heart and she shall join us.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:52.707
GROUP: Yes, Father.

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.849
Are you ready to join us?

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:04.819
Yes, Father.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.561
(SCREAMING)

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.715
FATHER SIMON:
<i>Can I share a story with you?</i>

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.774
So I'm 18 years old, right?

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.377
And I get a girl pregnant.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.784
And it's complicated by the
fact that we're in love.

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:37.386
And her mama didn't like it,
and my mama didn't like it

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:41.323
so we were cast out
on our own, you know.

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.794
I took a job at the burger joint,
mowed lawns on the weekends.

01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:49.397
A few months go by, she goes into
labor and she loses the baby.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.734
And I lose her.

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.673
They had to cut her open
and bled too much.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:59.341
There was nothing
they could do, you know.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:00.775
It was over real quick.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:05.381
So what do you do

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:07.516
when the worst thing,

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:11.587
the worst thing you can possibly
imagine, actually happens?

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:12.987
What do you do?

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:51.493
We're always going through life
and we're just getting by.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:56.731
<i>And doing what they're told to do,
but you don't have to do that.</i>

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.770
You can do what you want
and you can be happy.

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:16.152

our next transition?

FATHER SIMON: You've done all
that you can so far.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:40.809
You've purged
the poison from your soul.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.377
He knows that
you're here to serve him.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.915
He doesn't want to lose you
to the other side.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:53.354
He knows the pain
that you've suffered.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.890
It's time to take the first
step toward forgiveness.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.962
Are you ready
for your moment of revelation?

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:01.662
Yes, Father.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.922
My brother,

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:30.892
go in peace.

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:33.094
I love you, Father.

I'm sorry.

I believed in you.

And all that
I've asked in return

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.822
is that you have
a little faith in me.

Sister Robin has
pierced my soul.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.668

wasn't studying no puppy that day.

months, but I couldn't get it.

01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:52.140
Just like you're sayin', baby,
not too many, not too few.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.975
'Cause they gotta be able to be

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:55.543
close enough to
smell each other's fear

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:57.445
and feel each other come.

01:21:57.446 --> 01:21:59.014
I love it when you say that.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:00.682
FATHER SIMON: <i> We got Frank.</i>

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:02.550
Now, he's a lamb to the slaughter.
Nobody knows what's happenin'.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:04.585
Audience don't
know what to trust. Bam!

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.255
<i>Brian.</i>

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.857

<i>♪ Amen! ♪</i>

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:15.297
I mean, they're nice enough

01:22:15.298 --> 01:22:17.579
but nobody really gives a shit
if they live or die, right?

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.141
Then we get to the real meat.

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:32.180
<i>Alan and Evan,</i>
<i>my star-crossed lovers.</i>

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:33.247
(GUNSHOT)

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:40.221
We have Grace, my space cadet,
looking for the moon.

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:43.224
(GRACE SCREAMING)

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:44.192
FATHER SIMON: Get in here.
Shoot it, shoot it.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:45.727
(SCREAMING)

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:49.664
FATHER SIMON:
Ready? Ready? You ready?

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.067
Let's go. Let's go,
huh? I'm gonna go again.

01:22:52.068 --> 01:22:54.234
Hold that, hold that, hold that.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.274
We have Robin, my wallflower,

01:22:59.275 --> 01:23:00.841
<i>waiting for Prince Charming.</i>

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:07.082
We have Veronica, my redhead.

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:08.782
<i>She's thrown in just</i>
<i>to spice things up.</i>

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.555
(VERONICA SCREAMING)

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:17.758
<i>We have Ellen.</i>

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:23.797
That Ellen may be
the girl of my dreams.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.005
FATHER SIMON:
Are you ready to transition?

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:31.206
Yes, Father.

01:23:31.207 --> 01:23:32.439
Are you afraid?

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.609
No, Father.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:35.943
Let her have the gun.

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:39.214
What?
Give it to her.

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:40.749
Why?

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.416
Let her do it herself.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:44.751
FATHER SIMON: Mary!

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.257
FATHER SIMON:
Now do as we said.

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:50.991

FATHER SIMON: Good girl.

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:57.764
Good girl.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.803
What now?

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:04.938
FATHER SIMON: Just like Janet.

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:37.437
I love you, Father.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.508
(MATCH STRIKES)

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:41.775
(ELLEN SCREAMS)

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.519
Look, it's real simple.
Here's the zoom.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.521
In. Zoom out is right there.

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:30.558
Here's your focus. You see?

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:33.695
Just keep it on auto focus.
A lot easier.

01:25:33.696 --> 01:25:36.564
Frame me up here.
Don't get my profile, okay?

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:39.300
Just always three-quarters.
Right, don't zoom in unless I tell you to.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.902
No profiles,
you keep that in mind,

01:25:40.903 --> 01:25:43.371
we're gonna be fine, all right?

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:45.573
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:46.773
I trust you.
