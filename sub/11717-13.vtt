01:27.029 --> 01:28.142
Turn around.

01:28.143 --> 01:28.892
Slowly.

01:29.454 --> 01:30.241
Get up.

01:34.916 --> 01:36.066
What are you doing with that?

01:36.224 --> 01:37.049
Huh?

02:52.780 --> 02:55.294
I'll get HPD down here,
process the place.

02:55.555 --> 02:56.393
No.

02:56.749 --> 02:57.738
Don't bother.

02:58.686 --> 02:59.763
They're not going
to find anything.

02:59.764 --> 03:00.898
The guys wore gloves.

03:02.463 --> 03:03.400
What are you eating?

03:03.430 --> 03:05.521
Nothing. Ice, for your head.

03:05.522 --> 03:07.323
I'm fine. Don't be
a tough guy, okay?

03:07.324 --> 03:08.686
I've been popped with
a stun gun before,

03:08.687 --> 03:09.724
it's no fun. Ice helps.

03:09.725 --> 03:10.641
You've been stun gunned?

03:10.642 --> 03:12.716
Yes, I've been stunned.
Hoboken, Halloween '02.

03:12.717 --> 03:14.311
It's a long story I don't
want to tell you right now.

03:14.312 --> 03:15.806
How many guys were there? Three.

03:15.807 --> 03:17.796
Three. Okay, good,
'cause I was wondering how

03:17.797 --> 03:20.081
one little burglar comes
in and takes advantage

03:20.082 --> 03:22.072
of a Navy SEAL.
They weren't burglars, okay?

03:22.073 --> 03:24.337
They were professionals,
they were organized and precise.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.062
Yeah, the stun guns,
gloves, they knew exactly

03:26.063 --> 03:27.648
what they were after. There's
no doubt you were targeted.

03:27.649 --> 03:28.976
Yeah, targeted I understand.

03:28.977 --> 03:30.533
But how'd they get you?
Did you not put

03:30.534 --> 03:32.207
an alarm system in here
after the General Pak thing?

03:32.208 --> 03:33.721
I told you to do that.
I don't want to be a nag,

03:33.722 --> 03:36.144
but I did say you should do that.
I put it in, okay?

03:36.145 --> 03:37.166
They made a clean entry.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.083
They didn't trip the sensors,
I don't understand.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.649
Nothing was tripped because
they hacked your system

03:40.650 --> 03:42.030
using the alarm company's servers.

03:42.031 --> 03:44.142
They disarmed it as if
you did it yourself.

03:44.717 --> 03:46.331
Did you find out
where they came in?

03:46.332 --> 03:47.695
Yeah. There are boot
prints leading up to

03:47.696 --> 03:48.602
and away from the back door,

03:48.603 --> 03:50.393
but there are no signs
of forced entry.

03:50.394 --> 03:51.984
All the windows are secure, too.

03:51.985 --> 03:53.810
If they broke in,
I can't tell where.

03:55.546 --> 03:57.855
They take anything other
than your father's tool box?

03:57.856 --> 03:58.345
No.

03:58.346 --> 04:00.010
But my father's
entire investigation

04:00.011 --> 04:01.749
into my mother's
murder was in that box.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.775
All right, I'm not a rocket
scientist, but that is

04:03.776 --> 04:05.979
the reason the jackers were in here,
they wanted that evidence.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.197
How did they know
about the evidence?

04:07.198 --> 04:08.818
I didn't mention it to anyone.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.558
When I called HPD Archives
to get the accident report,

04:11.559 --> 04:12.997
I just asked for a file number.

04:12.998 --> 04:14.315
Did you guys mention the Champ box

04:14.316 --> 04:15.632
to anybody at all? Anybody?

04:15.633 --> 04:16.741
No. No.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.832
And you never talked about
it with anyone else?

04:19.833 --> 04:22.201
I talked to the
people in this room.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.238
And my sister.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.188
I talked to my sister.

04:31.194 --> 04:33.410
Hi, it's Mary.
Leave me a message.

04:34.793 --> 04:35.432
Something's wrong.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.212
Do me a favor, please.
Will you not go there?

04:37.213 --> 04:39.385
Okay? You don't know anything.
Maybe she went out last night.

04:39.386 --> 04:41.210
Maybe she got a little goofy,
she's sleeping it off.

04:41.211 --> 04:42.527
And let me be honest
about something,

04:42.528 --> 04:45.898
if, first thing in the morning,
I see your face pop on my phone,

04:45.899 --> 04:46.833
I might not answer it either.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.684
They didn't break
into the house, Danny.

04:49.046 --> 04:50.070
And the only other person

04:50.071 --> 04:52.046
who has a key to
the house is Mary.

05:10.204 --> 05:11.680
Mary, you in there?

05:15.300 --> 05:16.512
Mary, it's Steve.

05:28.545 --> 05:29.395
Mary.

05:57.946 --> 05:59.110
Whole house is clear.

06:02.497 --> 06:04.822
Maybe Mary was never here. Huh?

06:05.497 --> 06:07.372
Maybe they just
ransacked the place.

06:09.534 --> 06:10.471
She was here.

06:11.484 --> 06:12.459
I got blood.

06:16.612 --> 06:17.524
What the hell is that?

06:21.770 --> 06:22.645
It's a tooth.

06:24.107 --> 06:24.882
Mary's.

06:25.795 --> 06:26.645
I hope not.

06:28.095 --> 06:29.995
Whoever took the box took Mary.

06:37.350 --> 06:38.312
Any word from HPD?

06:38.313 --> 06:40.714
Nothing yet.
There's an APB out on Mary,

06:40.715 --> 06:41.967
and Kono's canvassing
the neighbors

06:41.968 --> 06:43.999
just in case anyone
heard or saw anything.

06:44.124 --> 06:45.774
All right.
This from the crime lab?

06:45.775 --> 06:47.762
Yeah. I had them rush the
blood and tooth analysis.

06:47.763 --> 06:49.562
Now, these results
are just preliminary,

06:49.563 --> 06:50.513
but the good news is,

06:50.514 --> 06:53.475
they look like they came
from the same person: male.

06:54.475 --> 06:55.341
Okay.

06:55.342 --> 06:56.399
No hits in the system, though.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.379
What about her cell phone?
We didn't find it at the scene.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.110
Yeah, I pulled her records

07:00.111 --> 07:01.971
looking for any anomalies
in the call history.

07:01.972 --> 07:03.732
There's only one that
looked out of place.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.766
That was to a surf
rental stand in Waikiki.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.132
Owner's name is Mamo Kahike.

07:12.078 --> 07:13.390
She called Mamo?

07:15.050 --> 07:16.025
You know this guy?

07:17.637 --> 07:18.500
Yeah, I did.

07:20.158 --> 07:22.048
Mamo lived in our old neighborhood

07:22.049 --> 07:23.471
when Mary and I were just kids.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.858
He's the one who
taught us how to surf.

07:25.985 --> 07:28.953
Guy's been a beach boy since
the days of Duke Kahanamoku.

07:28.954 --> 07:30.003
Beach Boy, huh?

07:30.004 --> 07:32.793
You know, I've heard of, um,
Mike Love, Brian Wilson,

07:32.794 --> 07:34.272
but I've never heard
of Mamo the Beach Boy.

07:34.273 --> 07:35.698
Yeah, different beach boys, Danny.

07:35.699 --> 07:38.025
They were locals who
set up shop in Waikiki

07:38.026 --> 07:39.162
to teach people how to surf.

07:39.163 --> 07:41.530
All right. Why would
Mary go and see this guy

07:41.531 --> 07:42.486
before she gets kidnapped?

07:42.487 --> 07:44.730
I don't know, but I'm guessing
it's not for surf lessons.

07:44.731 --> 07:45.599
There he is.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.542
Mamo!

07:51.292 --> 07:52.117
Stevie!

07:53.029 --> 07:54.518
Howzit, bruddah.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.745
You look great.

07:57.746 --> 07:59.661
You haven't changed in 18 years.

07:59.662 --> 08:02.175
Eh, da hair gone white and no
more get nothing in the biceps.

08:02.176 --> 08:04.872
Come on. You look great.
This is Detective Danny Williams.

08:04.873 --> 08:05.839
Detective?

08:05.840 --> 08:07.870
How you doing?
What bring you here?

08:07.871 --> 08:08.715
My sister.

08:10.077 --> 08:11.315
Did she come see you, Mamo?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.408
Yeah, she come around
couple days ago.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.045
Ask me questions
about your mother.

08:20.946 --> 08:21.857
What did you tell her?

08:22.220 --> 08:23.095
The truth.

08:23.957 --> 08:24.515
The truth being

08:24.516 --> 08:26.436
that my mother didn't
die in a car accident,

08:26.437 --> 08:27.925
that it was a car
bomb that killed her?

08:29.112 --> 08:29.849
Yes.

08:30.104 --> 08:31.567
How did you know, Mamo?

08:32.542 --> 08:33.712
Before your mom died

08:33.712 --> 08:36.133
in that car, I saw a
cop hanging around it,

08:36.145 --> 08:37.282
looking under it.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.633
I know it was a long time ago.

08:38.634 --> 08:39.683
You get a good look at him?

08:39.683 --> 08:41.732
Asian. Maybe six feet?

08:41.995 --> 08:44.732
I tell your father.
He told me not to report it.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.145
Not to trust any other cop.

08:47.518 --> 08:50.130
I would have kept my
promise to your father,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.305
but when Mary come to me,

08:52.930 --> 08:54.705
I felt an obligation to her...

08:56.479 --> 08:57.704
...and now to you.

09:01.229 --> 09:02.279
All this time...

09:02.484 --> 09:03.960
Why you come to me now?

09:04.030 --> 09:06.207
Because I think the questions
that Mary's been asking

09:06.208 --> 09:08.605
about our mother have
just got her kidnapped.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.532
Oh, no. No.

09:21.438 --> 09:23.088
I should've seen this coming.

09:23.492 --> 09:24.667
You should have seen what coming,
a kidnapping?

09:24.668 --> 09:27.166
No. Mary digging around the box.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.111
I mean, she's my sister.
I know what she's like.

09:29.112 --> 09:30.044
The minute she found out

09:30.045 --> 09:31.705
that Dad was looking
into our mother's murder,

09:31.706 --> 09:33.311
she would never have let that go.

09:33.312 --> 09:35.436
And now it's my
fault she's missing.

09:35.696 --> 09:36.587
I don't know where she is.

09:36.588 --> 09:38.762
For all I know...
You don't know anything.

09:38.763 --> 09:41.711
All right? Your sister
Mary is a very smart girl.

09:41.712 --> 09:43.089
Can we just think
positive a little bit?

09:43.090 --> 09:43.549
Can we do that?

09:43.550 --> 09:45.862
Danny, they took her.
She saw their faces.

09:45.863 --> 09:48.094
They took her because
she is valuable to them.

09:48.095 --> 09:50.121
You understand that?
She is valuable.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.535
She knows what's inside that box.

09:51.536 --> 09:52.742
They want to know what she knows.

09:52.743 --> 09:53.539
All right, this is a good thing.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.938
This keeps her alive,
you understand?

09:54.939 --> 09:55.935
All right. We're gonna find her.

09:55.936 --> 09:57.842
We're gonna find her.
And after that,

09:57.843 --> 09:59.849
we're gonna find that
cop that Mamo saw.

10:00.035 --> 10:01.327
I need a list of all the officers

10:01.328 --> 10:03.398
on the force at the
time of my mom's murder.

10:03.399 --> 10:04.721
Do you not think that your father

10:04.722 --> 10:06.173
didn't already
investigate these guys?

10:06.174 --> 10:07.475
Yeah, I'm sure he did,
but don't you think

10:07.476 --> 10:09.046
there's a reason he
didn't make an arrest?

10:09.047 --> 10:10.810
Absolutely. Evidence.
He didn't have any.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.856
All right? You go after a cop,

10:11.857 --> 10:12.722
you better make sure

10:12.723 --> 10:14.341
you know what you are doing,
or you will have

10:14.342 --> 10:16.118
an entire department
coming after you.

10:17.305 --> 10:18.043
It's Mary.

10:18.412 --> 10:20.052
Mary? Mary? Where are you?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.386
Steve. Oh, my God, Steve.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.236
I'm so sorry!

10:24.341 --> 10:26.253
Calm down. Calm down.
Listen to me.

10:26.254 --> 10:27.316
Where are you, Mary?

10:27.317 --> 10:28.490
Tell me where you are.

10:28.491 --> 10:30.979
I'm in a trunk of a car!

10:31.368 --> 10:32.920
We need to triangulate her signal.

10:32.921 --> 10:34.152
Okay. Listen to me, Mary.

10:34.153 --> 10:36.263
You got to trust me on this one.
I'm going to find you,

10:36.264 --> 10:37.186
I can promise you that,

10:37.187 --> 10:38.501
but you go to do what I say,
all right? Chin.

10:38.502 --> 10:41.358
We got Mary up on her cell.
We need a location right now.

10:41.359 --> 10:42.256
You got to run a trace.

10:42.257 --> 10:44.598
Okay, Mary. Listen. Can you
see the taillight housing?

10:44.599 --> 10:46.248
They should be on
either side of you.

10:46.848 --> 10:48.402
Yeah, yeah, I see them.

10:48.403 --> 10:50.028
Kick them out, Mary.
You got to kick them out.

10:50.029 --> 10:51.020
Kick them as hard as you can.

10:51.021 --> 10:51.894
All right. All right.

10:58.370 --> 10:59.309
I got it, I got it out.

10:59.310 --> 10:59.983
Look outside,

10:59.984 --> 11:01.220
tell me what you see.

11:01.266 --> 11:02.807
Tell me if you're passing
anything familiar.

11:02.808 --> 11:04.206
Something to help me find you.

11:06.218 --> 11:07.647
No. I don't see anything.

11:07.648 --> 11:10.348
We're just... It's a dirt
road and we're climbing.

11:10.349 --> 11:11.457
All right, you're climbing, okay.

11:11.458 --> 11:12.708
What do you see, Mary?

11:12.709 --> 11:14.358
Look out. Can you
look left or right?

11:14.359 --> 11:15.589
Can you see town?
Can you see Kailua?

11:15.590 --> 11:17.770
What part of the Island are you on?
Yeah, yeah, I see

11:17.771 --> 11:19.123
the...

11:20.522 --> 11:21.272
Mary?!

11:22.369 --> 11:24.192
Chin, did you get a location?

11:24.193 --> 11:26.195
I couldn't get a lock,
but the last signal that came

11:26.196 --> 11:28.956
from her cell phone bounced off
a transponder near Punchbowl.

11:28.957 --> 11:29.552
All right, Chin, listen,

11:29.553 --> 11:30.815
it's coming from
the trunk of a car,

11:30.816 --> 11:32.082
climbing upwards, all right?

11:32.083 --> 11:33.652
That's got to be the Pali Highway.

11:33.685 --> 11:35.541
There are dirt roads that
lead to the forest reserves

11:35.542 --> 11:37.353
right before Maunawili. Yeah.

11:40.808 --> 11:41.954
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:41.955 --> 11:43.555
Pali Highway's that way. Yeah.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.231
Yeah, what? Why are
you going this way?

11:45.232 --> 11:46.983
Because we can't get
there fast enough by car.

12:03.691 --> 12:05.290
Be safe, bro.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.751
All right, I've got HPD and
DLNR units setting up roadblocks

12:33.752 --> 12:34.869
on either side of the Pali,

12:34.870 --> 12:36.453
checking trunks now.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.015
Danny, Danny, heading
up the east ridgeline.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.823
Check out the taillight.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.111
Yep. It's out.

13:02.877 --> 13:03.765
Hold on.

13:17.742 --> 13:19.154
Hey! Hey! Hey! Gun!

13:29.159 --> 13:31.233
- Mary!
- Help!

13:33.381 --> 13:34.194
Come here.
Oh, my God!

14:00.983 --> 14:01.882
Hey, kiddo.

14:03.507 --> 14:04.270
Thanks.

14:04.995 --> 14:05.894
Show me that.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.880
Hey, I'm really sorry

14:16.881 --> 14:18.841
that I went snooping
through the box, okay?

14:18.842 --> 14:19.780
You can rub it in later.

14:19.781 --> 14:21.220
I wasn't going to run it in.

14:21.656 --> 14:24.168
You know it's the only
link that I had to Dad.

14:25.953 --> 14:28.141
I just wanted to know what
it all meant, you know,

14:28.142 --> 14:31.012
between Mom's accident and...

14:31.799 --> 14:34.072
finding out it wasn't an accident.

14:34.073 --> 14:34.849
I understand, okay?

14:34.850 --> 14:37.074
I mean, I was just piecing
it together myself.

14:39.341 --> 14:40.666
Why did you go to Mamo?

14:41.149 --> 14:42.497
Because there was a postcard

14:42.498 --> 14:43.929
from his surf shop with a bunch

14:43.930 --> 14:46.324
of Dad's chicken scratch
all over it. I remember.

14:46.325 --> 14:48.009
It said something like "Maglite,"

14:48.010 --> 14:49.429
but there was no
Maglite in the box.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.767
No, but it's not a Maglite.

14:52.254 --> 14:54.324
See the "G" Is actually a six.

14:54.325 --> 14:57.854
So it's M-A-six-L-T.

14:58.954 --> 15:00.479
It's cop shorthand.

15:00.758 --> 15:02.295
How do you know cop shorthand?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.523
Um, because I had this
incident once in L.A.

15:04.524 --> 15:06.411
What incident?
It doesn't matter, all right?

15:06.412 --> 15:07.737
But the cop was writing down

15:07.738 --> 15:10.202
all the information
in the same shorthand.

15:10.203 --> 15:11.719
So I figured that's what it was.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.735
And since the postcard
came from Mamo's,

15:13.736 --> 15:16.361
I thought, well,
maybe he's a witness.

15:17.894 --> 15:19.931
And it turns out I was right.

15:21.143 --> 15:23.554
So the M-A-six-L-T
is a description

15:23.555 --> 15:24.743
that he gave Dad.

15:25.654 --> 15:29.929
M-A-six... male, Asian,
six feet tall, light complexion.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.916
The cop that was lurking
around Dad's car.

15:34.791 --> 15:35.602
Wait a minute.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.609
Where did you go after
Mamo told you all this?

15:38.257 --> 15:39.746
I-I didn't go anywhere.

15:40.245 --> 15:43.207
I've been calling
the HPD for months

15:43.208 --> 15:44.789
trying to get a police report.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.644
And they claim it's lost.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.819
So I asked them for a list of
all the officers that were there

15:50.820 --> 15:53.819
the day of Mom's death,
and they shut me down again.

15:54.369 --> 15:57.332
I mean, I was being a complete
pain in the ass, but...

15:58.931 --> 16:01.956
I was doing it for Mom, okay?

16:02.882 --> 16:04.443
Who did you talk to at the HPD?

16:06.168 --> 16:08.127
Everybody. Why?

16:08.128 --> 16:09.445
Because we busted a mole in there

16:09.446 --> 16:10.757
a while back, and if he found out

16:10.758 --> 16:12.266
you were there asking questions,
he could have

16:12.267 --> 16:14.119
passed it on to all
the wrong people.

16:14.494 --> 16:17.106
I mean, I can't believe
you did all this, Mary.

16:17.662 --> 16:21.981
Well, I mean, Dad's a cop,
you're like a freakin' ninja.

16:24.394 --> 16:27.131
The least I could
do was dial a phone.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.583
You're something else.

16:41.137 --> 16:41.974
Hey.

16:45.072 --> 16:45.758
I love you.

16:45.759 --> 16:48.052
And I'm really sorry about
what happened to you today.

16:52.883 --> 16:55.032
You know why Dad
shipped us away now.

16:57.461 --> 16:59.121
It's 'cause Mom was killed.

17:00.658 --> 17:02.308
He was trying to protect us.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.031
How are you going to
find these guys, Steve?

17:13.926 --> 17:14.740
I don't know.

17:15.528 --> 17:17.011
But the only other
evidence that was had

17:17.012 --> 17:18.874
about Mom's murder
was in that toolbox

17:18.875 --> 17:19.848
and now it's gone.

17:21.342 --> 17:22.179
Wait.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.454
Not exactly.

17:31.940 --> 17:34.827
I can't believe you took photos
of everything in the box.

17:35.766 --> 17:37.451
I'm sorry I went behind your back.

17:37.452 --> 17:38.623
I think I'll get over it.

17:38.624 --> 17:39.650
I think you have a future

17:39.651 --> 17:41.513
in the family business.
Okay, wait a minute.

17:41.514 --> 17:42.753
Why the two folders?

17:43.553 --> 17:45.639
Well, after I went
through the stuff,

17:45.640 --> 17:48.253
I figured that anything that
had to do with Mom's case,

17:48.254 --> 17:49.540
I'd put over here.

17:49.983 --> 17:51.254
And then that stuff...
I have no clue.

17:51.255 --> 17:53.817
Like the postcards from Japan.

17:56.174 --> 17:57.830
I don't know what the
stick figures mean.

17:57.831 --> 17:58.623
I think they're from

17:58.624 --> 18:02.288
a Sherlock Holmes story...
Adventure of the Dancing Men.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.409
Sherlock Holmes?
What are you talking about?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.242
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

18:06.243 --> 18:08.605
Dad used to read me those
books all the time. Okay.

18:08.606 --> 18:10.737
He said you never had the patience.
Does that mean

18:10.738 --> 18:13.169
you know what these stick figures mean,
Mary? I don't know, bro.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.220
I mean, you're the
naval intelligence guy.

18:15.732 --> 18:19.292
I think Holmes cracked some
code or something in the story.

18:19.293 --> 18:21.486
Hey, Danny just called
from the M.E.'s office.

18:21.487 --> 18:23.287
No hits on our two
kidnappers' prints,

18:23.288 --> 18:26.062
no IDs, no DNA matches
in our system.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.236
These guys are ghosts.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.032
Plus, they both had
all their teeth.

18:30.033 --> 18:32.235
No, but there was a third
guy calling the shots,

18:32.236 --> 18:35.122
and that's whose tooth I knocked out.
Nice work there, by the way.

18:35.313 --> 18:37.910
Did Max get anything?
Check this out.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.115
Whoa, that is some
top-tier craftsmanship.

18:47.116 --> 18:47.945
That's not any style either.

18:47.946 --> 18:50.535
That's old school irezumi. Yakuza.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.505
Yeah. But judging by the work,

18:52.506 --> 18:54.955
no full-on sleeves, these
guys are low-level enforcers.

18:54.956 --> 18:56.300
Mm-hmm, Bosozoku.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.211
Bozo-zu... What is that?

18:58.212 --> 19:00.563
It's a younger,
flashier offshoot of the Yakuza.

19:00.564 --> 19:01.299
They're punks.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.913
But they're armed
and dangerous punks.

19:02.914 --> 19:04.525
All right, we know
where they hang out?

19:04.526 --> 19:06.799
Every cop in Oahu knows
where they hang out.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.584
Everyone just treats them
like they're not here.

19:08.585 --> 19:09.917
It's like they're Untouchables.

19:23.834 --> 19:24.805
This is the place.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.441
If our third attacker
isn't in here,

19:29.442 --> 19:30.234
they'll know where to find him.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.509
Whoo. They got nice rides.

19:34.351 --> 19:37.225
You know something? I've always
wanted to ride one of these.

19:53.462 --> 19:54.762
Hey!

19:55.950 --> 19:57.157
All right, up. Up, up, up, up, up.

19:57.158 --> 19:58.890
Come on. Get up. Face the wall.

19:58.891 --> 20:00.004
Let's see hands.

20:00.816 --> 20:01.666
Turn around.

20:01.922 --> 20:02.654
That means you.

20:02.655 --> 20:03.328
Come on.

20:03.609 --> 20:04.872
Get in there. Danny.

20:07.797 --> 20:10.571
I have a number of a therapist

20:10.572 --> 20:11.778
I want to give you, okay?

20:11.779 --> 20:14.649
Walk up steps like a human.

20:19.023 --> 20:21.510
Ooh. What's up with this?

20:29.794 --> 20:30.656
Clear.

20:31.356 --> 20:31.892
Clear.

20:31.893 --> 20:34.493
All right. Turn around.

20:41.522 --> 20:42.485
These friends of yours?

20:43.426 --> 20:44.240
Huh?

20:47.038 --> 20:48.000
They friends of yours?

20:49.239 --> 20:51.125
'Cause right now,
they're dead, okay?

20:51.613 --> 20:53.213
And I want to know
who they worked for.

20:53.814 --> 20:55.180
So the first one to talk

20:55.181 --> 20:56.134
walks.

20:57.093 --> 20:58.984
How about you?
You know these guys?

21:03.189 --> 21:04.239
What do you got there?

21:07.114 --> 21:08.452
Say, "Aah."

21:14.609 --> 21:16.080
All right.
Everybody, hit the road,

21:16.081 --> 21:17.444
except for our friend here.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.638
Come on, let's go. Out, get out.

21:20.527 --> 21:22.114
Right this way, gentlemen.

21:23.492 --> 21:24.693
Danny?

21:25.505 --> 21:26.730
Yes, Steven?

21:26.927 --> 21:28.984
Theoretically, if you wanted
to open this guy's mouth,

21:28.985 --> 21:29.876
how would you do it?

21:29.877 --> 21:33.386
Oh. Uh, well, there's the,
uh, the punch in the gut.

21:33.387 --> 21:35.984
That's good. There's the
knee to the... joint.

21:35.985 --> 21:37.546
And then I, of course have

21:37.547 --> 21:39.067
the Williams family favorite.

21:39.068 --> 21:40.123
What's that?

21:44.566 --> 21:45.469
Aah. Aah, aah,

21:45.470 --> 21:46.890
aah, aah, aah. All right.

21:47.026 --> 21:49.213
Aah. Nice and still.

21:49.677 --> 21:50.942
Yeah. Look at that.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.281
Missing a tooth.

21:52.282 --> 21:54.845
Looks recent, too. Stay there.

21:57.571 --> 21:58.296
All right.

21:58.544 --> 22:00.725
Chin, Kono, take him in.

22:00.726 --> 22:02.401
Get the tooth from the M.E.

22:03.095 --> 22:05.170
Let's see if the slipper fits,
Cinderella.

22:09.093 --> 22:10.255
Excuse me? Um...

22:10.286 --> 22:12.247
You don't want to just try
asking him a question?

22:12.248 --> 22:13.222
He was never gonna talk.

22:13.223 --> 22:14.422
No, of course he
wasn't gonna talk.

22:14.423 --> 22:15.436
You didn't throw him
into a shark tank.

22:15.437 --> 22:17.416
Danny, these guys are
Yakuza middlemen.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.816
Okay? They don't talk, ever.

22:18.817 --> 22:19.550
They know if they do,

22:19.551 --> 22:20.790
their families will get wiped out.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.018
We need to go higher
up the food chain

22:22.019 --> 22:23.483
to find out who's
behind this kidnapping

22:23.484 --> 22:24.352
and my mother's murder.

22:24.353 --> 22:26.149
Okay, but without the tooth fairy,

22:26.150 --> 22:27.373
how are we going to do that?

22:28.435 --> 22:29.473
This may help.

22:31.963 --> 22:33.870
So, it took me a while to
crack the phone's encryption,

22:33.871 --> 22:35.974
but I pulled up several calls
from our kidnapper's phone

22:35.975 --> 22:37.112
to this man.

22:37.675 --> 22:38.962
Hiro Noshimuri.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.724
And the last one being
an outgoing call

22:40.725 --> 22:42.223
right around the time
Mary said she was taken.

22:42.224 --> 22:44.353
Oh, hold on. Steve needs to hear this.
What is he doing?

22:46.216 --> 22:47.017
Hey.

22:47.473 --> 22:48.848
Come on. We got something.

22:57.225 --> 22:57.828
All right.

22:57.829 --> 23:00.012
What did you find?
Prominent venture capitalist,

23:00.013 --> 23:00.978
originally from Japan.

23:00.979 --> 23:03.461
He has residences there,
Dubai, Malibu,

23:03.462 --> 23:04.503
three here in Hawaii.

23:04.504 --> 23:05.561
He's really well-connected.

23:05.562 --> 23:07.428
From everything I
could gather, he seems

23:07.429 --> 23:10.363
like a very well-respected,
very wealthy entrepreneur.

23:10.364 --> 23:12.641
But that does not mean
he's not with the Yakuza.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.853
Right? In Jan,
the mob has been known to work

23:14.854 --> 23:17.229
out in the open with
major corporations.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.067
What's his name?

23:18.068 --> 23:19.681
Hiro Noshimuri.

23:26.255 --> 23:27.155
Did I say something?

23:32.510 --> 23:33.535
What did you say?

23:34.122 --> 23:35.334
Hiro Noshimuri.

23:36.159 --> 23:36.985
That's it.

23:37.947 --> 23:39.216
That's the cipher.

23:39.217 --> 23:40.517
Hiro Noshimuri.

23:42.104 --> 23:43.489
The cipher. What does that mean?

23:43.490 --> 23:45.179
In 1992, my dad was the head

23:45.180 --> 23:46.712
of the HPD's organized crime unit.

23:46.713 --> 23:48.082
He was investigating the expansion

23:48.083 --> 23:49.416
of the Yakuza here in Hawaii.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.403
And he was corresponding
with somebody in Japan,

23:51.404 --> 23:54.240
somebody who gave him
the name Hiro Noshimuri,

23:54.241 --> 23:55.667
in code, right here.

23:56.153 --> 23:58.452
You-you got a name
from a stick figure?

23:58.453 --> 23:59.924
The stick figures are the code.

23:59.925 --> 24:02.143
I used Frequency
Analysis to crack it.

24:02.144 --> 24:02.977
"Frequency" What?

24:02.978 --> 24:05.140
Frequency Analysis.
It's a study the frequency

24:05.141 --> 24:06.458
of letters or groups of letters

24:06.459 --> 24:07.296
in a cypher text.

24:07.297 --> 24:08.425
What, are you guys dating now?

24:08.426 --> 24:10.235
This is it.
My dad was getting closer.

24:10.236 --> 24:11.708
He wanted to uncover the identity

24:11.709 --> 24:13.820
of the local oyabun, the boss.

24:14.008 --> 24:15.329
That's why they targeted him.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.570
The Yakuza wanted him dead,

24:16.571 --> 24:18.594
so they planted a
bomb under his car,

24:18.595 --> 24:21.794
only they didn't bet on my
mother driving the car that day.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.792
And that's why my dad wanted
me to find that toolbox.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.477
To finish this investigation
that he started.

24:30.439 --> 24:32.467
I need to know where
this guy is right now.

24:46.468 --> 24:47.342
There he is.

24:48.514 --> 24:49.890
No, no. Guys, please.

24:49.891 --> 24:50.902
Sit down. Relax.

24:50.903 --> 24:52.310
We're just gonna have
a nice conversation.

24:52.311 --> 24:53.951
Go back to your, um...

24:54.938 --> 24:55.723
Spam...

24:55.724 --> 24:56.512
salad.

24:58.421 --> 25:00.295
Please. Have a seat.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.239
You know, unless you're my date,

25:06.240 --> 25:07.677
that seat's taken.

25:08.428 --> 25:11.303
You're really gonna sit here and
pretend you don't know who I am?

25:13.490 --> 25:14.632
Now that you mention it,

25:14.633 --> 25:17.137
there's something quite
familiar about your face.

25:19.746 --> 25:21.184
Let me jog your memory.

25:23.348 --> 25:24.436
See this phone?

25:25.086 --> 25:27.560
This phone belonged to the
man who kidnapped my sister.

25:28.774 --> 25:31.872
Kidnapper? Serious.

25:32.079 --> 25:33.867
The last person he called was you.

25:39.453 --> 25:40.529
Wrong number.

25:41.205 --> 25:44.027
I can assure you that I don't
know anything about this.

25:44.526 --> 25:46.501
I'm just here for my lunch date.

25:46.789 --> 25:48.451
Let me tell you something.

25:51.082 --> 25:52.357
I know who you are.

25:53.357 --> 25:56.141
I know what you've done
to me and to my family.

25:56.142 --> 25:57.437
And I'm here to tell you

25:57.438 --> 26:01.294
that no amount of money or
manpower is going to save you.

26:02.594 --> 26:03.982
Save me?

26:05.818 --> 26:07.207
From what?

26:08.618 --> 26:09.593
From me.

26:11.055 --> 26:12.291
What did you say your name was?

26:13.992 --> 26:14.878
McGarrett?

26:16.103 --> 26:17.740
Governor Jameson.

26:18.052 --> 26:19.471
So nice to see you again.

26:20.658 --> 26:21.722
Nice to see you.

26:26.371 --> 26:27.283
My date.

26:27.968 --> 26:29.343
You know this man?

26:29.709 --> 26:30.434
I certainly do.

26:30.435 --> 26:32.346
We've been friends for years.

26:33.376 --> 26:36.979
Mr. Noshimuri is a most
generous benefactor of Hawaii.

26:38.276 --> 26:39.288
Is that right?

26:39.460 --> 26:40.585
Yes, it is.

26:41.848 --> 26:43.198
What is it you're doing here?

26:43.885 --> 26:45.060
Enjoy your lunch.

27:18.755 --> 27:19.973
I just spent the last two hours

27:19.974 --> 27:21.061
and a hefty drink tab

27:21.062 --> 27:23.461
trying to talk down Mr. Noshimuri.

27:24.023 --> 27:24.973
What were you thinking?

27:26.748 --> 27:27.816
You're drinking with a criminal.

27:27.817 --> 27:29.567
Just stop right there.

27:29.602 --> 27:31.663
That man is responsible
for over 1,200 jobs

27:31.664 --> 27:33.620
in the Hawaii shipping
industry alone.

27:33.621 --> 27:35.162
Not to mention the
other nine companies

27:35.163 --> 27:36.133
he has established here.

27:36.134 --> 27:38.973
Let me guess. He's a major
contributor to your campaign?

27:40.682 --> 27:42.294
Let me tell you something.

27:42.682 --> 27:45.779
I set up this task force,
I gave you immunity

27:45.780 --> 27:47.275
and the means to
pursue major felons,

27:47.276 --> 27:50.544
not to harass major
supporters of Hawaii.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.221
If Mr. Noshimuri decides
to pull up stakes and move

27:53.222 --> 27:55.263
his considerable business
ventures elsewhere,

27:55.264 --> 27:57.769
do you have any idea what would
happen to the local economy?

27:57.770 --> 28:00.095
Well, on the brighter side,
the crime rate's gonna drop.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.740
What the hell are
you talking about?

28:01.741 --> 28:04.553
Hiro is head of the
Yakuza here in Hawaii.

28:06.081 --> 28:06.690
That is ridiculous.

28:06.691 --> 28:09.201
18 years ago, my father
was investigating a case

28:09.202 --> 28:10.453
against the Yakuza.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.953
He started closing in on Hiro.

28:12.990 --> 28:16.027
Okay? So they rigged
his car to explode.

28:16.057 --> 28:18.620
Except my father was not
driving his car that day.

28:18.636 --> 28:20.961
My mother was.
Steve, that was an accident.

28:20.962 --> 28:22.629
It was not an accident, Governor!

28:22.630 --> 28:24.036
Damn it! Listen to me!

28:24.448 --> 28:26.010
It was not an accident!

28:26.073 --> 28:27.831
And my father knew it
was not an accident,

28:27.832 --> 28:28.476
but he pulled back

28:28.477 --> 28:30.729
because of Mary and me,
because we were just kids.

28:30.730 --> 28:33.208
I knew your father. If that was true,
he would have told me.

28:33.209 --> 28:34.478
That's just the thing.

28:35.007 --> 28:36.558
He didn't tell anybody.

28:37.070 --> 28:38.672
And when he died, I found

28:38.673 --> 28:40.506
this evidence that he left for me.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.094
The evidence that led me to Hiro.

28:43.694 --> 28:45.505
And Mary got her hands on it.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.105
And she started
making phone calls,

28:47.106 --> 28:47.991
looking into Mom's death.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.976
And yesterday,
Hiro had her kidnapped.

28:49.977 --> 28:50.799
What?

28:51.616 --> 28:53.090
Oh, my God. Where is she?
Is she all right?

28:53.091 --> 28:55.041
She's fine. She's fine for now.

28:55.519 --> 28:56.719
Oh, thank God.

29:05.538 --> 29:06.750
I'm sorry, Steve.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.438
Yeah.

29:11.727 --> 29:13.652
Is there any beer in this office?

29:14.827 --> 29:15.651
What?

29:16.339 --> 29:20.001
I have never known a Navy man
who couldn't find a lady a beer.

29:21.139 --> 29:22.177
Uh, yeah.

29:22.626 --> 29:23.551
Of course.

29:25.909 --> 29:27.509
I'll, uh... scrounge up a glass.

29:27.510 --> 29:28.375
Eh...

29:30.779 --> 29:31.670
Thank you.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.107
Steve...

29:43.171 --> 29:45.244
I trust your instincts...

29:46.407 --> 29:47.294
But?

29:50.900 --> 29:52.525
If what you say is true,

29:53.702 --> 29:57.000
and you're going to go after someone
as powerful and as connected

29:57.650 --> 29:59.477
as Hiro Noshimuri,

30:00.654 --> 30:03.278
you better be damn certain
you've got rock solid evidence,

30:03.279 --> 30:06.422
and proceed with extreme caution.

30:07.634 --> 30:08.584
Duly noted.

30:08.601 --> 30:10.064
Because if you don't,

30:10.820 --> 30:13.255
I don't think I'm going
to be able to protect you.

30:19.366 --> 30:20.679
Well, that, uh, looked
like it went really well.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.720
Should I pack now

30:21.721 --> 30:23.399
for Jersey, or... You're
not getting off that easy.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.667
I want to know everything
there is to know

30:24.668 --> 30:26.229
about Hiro Noshimuri, okay?

30:26.230 --> 30:28.104
I want to know every
business he runs,

30:28.254 --> 30:29.902
who all his employees are,

30:29.903 --> 30:32.185
All his family members,
every friend he has.

30:32.186 --> 30:33.069
I want to know where he eats.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.396
I want to know where he sleeps.
I want it all, okay?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.933
We're gonna tear
into this guy's life,

30:38.196 --> 30:39.758
and we're gonna rip it all apart.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.510
I have never liked you more
than in this moment right now.

30:44.511 --> 30:45.498
It's beautiful.

30:50.837 --> 30:52.198
Keep talking, smart-ass.

30:52.199 --> 30:53.352
You think those
zip-cuffs are tight now?

30:53.353 --> 30:54.298
They can get a lot tighter.

30:54.299 --> 30:57.636
Kono, I want this place
strip-searched, top to bottom.

30:57.637 --> 30:59.650
I need something... anything...
that connects to Hiro.

30:59.651 --> 31:00.638
Yeah, you got it.

31:01.195 --> 31:04.381
Hey. I just got off the
phone with HPD Archives.

31:04.382 --> 31:06.250
Remember how you asked me for
the names of all the cops

31:06.251 --> 31:07.450
on the roster back in '92?

31:07.451 --> 31:09.016
Yeah? Well, it turns out

31:09.017 --> 31:10.840
there was a cop who worked
in your father's district

31:10.841 --> 31:12.854
by the name of Koji Noshimuri.

31:12.981 --> 31:14.454
Now, if that name sounds familiar,

31:14.455 --> 31:16.844
it's because he's the
brother of Hiro Noshimuri.

31:19.933 --> 31:21.869
All right, that-that
cannot be a coincidence.

31:21.870 --> 31:23.235
He's got to be the cop
that planted the bomb

31:23.236 --> 31:24.486
on my dad's car. Mm-hmm.

31:24.487 --> 31:25.496
I'm going to head back to HQ,

31:25.497 --> 31:26.434
pull everything I can on him.

31:26.435 --> 31:28.767
Listen, we get a photo,
bring it to your boy Mamo,

31:28.768 --> 31:30.157
maybe he can put an ID him,

31:30.158 --> 31:32.346
put him at the crime scene.
Maybe, but people look different

31:32.347 --> 31:34.383
after 18 years. We're gonna
need a photo from back then.

31:34.384 --> 31:36.405
Yeah. No. I think I
know where to get one.

31:36.981 --> 31:38.906
My dad was a total pack rat.

31:39.181 --> 31:41.109
Kept everything from
his days as a cop.

31:41.110 --> 31:42.949
If he's got a copy of
his district picture,

31:42.950 --> 31:43.745
it's gonna be here.

31:43.746 --> 31:45.557
They make every officer take one.

31:45.558 --> 31:47.388
I blinked during mine.
I look like I'm sleeping.

31:47.389 --> 31:49.171
Grace thinks it's hysterical.

31:53.614 --> 31:55.103
Koji Noshimuri.

31:55.677 --> 31:57.285
That's him. That's the guy.

32:00.078 --> 32:02.165
Let's hope your boy
Mamo's got a good memory.

32:05.771 --> 32:07.713
Chin. Tell me you got Koji.

32:07.714 --> 32:11.493
He's alive and well, and working
for his brother as... get this...

32:11.494 --> 32:12.516
a consultant.

32:12.517 --> 32:14.742
He's got a place downtown,
but he travels back and forth

32:14.743 --> 32:16.281
to Japan a lot for Hiro.

32:16.433 --> 32:18.269
Let me ask you a question.
How does a consultant

32:18.270 --> 32:20.226
working for the Yakuza
earn a paycheck?

32:20.227 --> 32:22.219
Cleaning up his brother's messes.

32:22.655 --> 32:25.104
Hey, find out if Koji's
in the country, okay?

32:25.105 --> 32:26.367
If so, I want to know where.

32:26.368 --> 32:27.367
Roger that.

32:30.436 --> 32:31.305
What? What are you looking at?

32:31.306 --> 32:32.979
What's with you? Nothing, nothing.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.737
I thought we had a tail.
Blue sedan

32:34.738 --> 32:36.764
made the last two turns with us.
But it peeled off now.

32:41.614 --> 32:42.741
So, what do you think?

32:43.052 --> 32:44.327
The guy by the car that day?

32:44.452 --> 32:46.158
It looks like da kine, but...

32:46.159 --> 32:47.987
Mamo, Listen.
Take your time, okay?

32:47.988 --> 32:49.020
This is important.

32:50.148 --> 32:52.958
I think your father showed
me this picture once, too.

32:53.446 --> 32:54.808
I can't be sure.

33:04.257 --> 33:06.231
Danny. Danny, Danny.

33:07.107 --> 33:07.945
Black hat.

33:08.656 --> 33:10.444
That's one of the guys
that broke into my house.

33:11.837 --> 33:13.536
Gun! Gun! Gun! Down!

33:37.382 --> 33:38.991
Who paid you to break
into McGarrett's house?

33:38.992 --> 33:40.336
Who you working for? Hiro?

33:40.705 --> 33:41.983
You working for Hiro?

33:42.445 --> 33:44.520
Is that who sent you, was it Hiro?

33:58.878 --> 34:01.279
Shonin, is he dead?

34:01.765 --> 34:04.540
No. But when I find you,
you will be.

34:12.212 --> 34:15.001
So, uh, were those bullets
for you or for your boy?

34:15.002 --> 34:17.297
I don't know, but we got
to put a security detail

34:17.299 --> 34:19.024
on him. I got HPD on it now.

34:19.025 --> 34:20.860
You get anything off
the shooter? No.

34:20.862 --> 34:23.292
Chin trace that phone? Yeah,
it's a disposable.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.134
We got no name,
we got no location.

34:25.135 --> 34:26.109
It was Hiro.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.389
Okay. You spoke to the guy once...

34:29.614 --> 34:30.940
Already recognize his voice?

34:30.940 --> 34:32.943
Yeah, well, some things in
life you don't forget. Okay,

34:32.944 --> 34:35.664
so you know, I have an amazing,
amazing amount

34:35.665 --> 34:37.596
of respect for your memory,
all right?

34:37.597 --> 34:38.850
But without hard evidence...

34:38.851 --> 34:40.753
hello... without hard evidence,

34:40.754 --> 34:44.041
we cannot... not go after
Hiro or his brother,

34:44.042 --> 34:45.875
and I am sure your father
was in the same position

34:45.876 --> 34:48.146
18 years ago. Hey, listen to me,
I'm not father, okay?

34:48.147 --> 34:49.882
I don't have a wife
and kids to protect.

34:49.884 --> 34:50.873
That doesn't give you license

34:50.875 --> 34:52.282
to go out and do something stupid.

34:52.283 --> 34:54.870
Like what, put bullets
in Koji and Hiro's heads?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.621
Yeah, that would qualify.

35:05.936 --> 35:08.317
All right, you heard the boss...
We'll take whatever we can get.

35:08.318 --> 35:10.257
Drugs, guns, cash, paperwork.

35:10.258 --> 35:12.311
Bag it and tag it and
get it back to HQ.

35:15.173 --> 35:17.188
Hey, you two, come on,
come with me.

35:17.189 --> 35:17.971
Let's go.

35:20.249 --> 35:20.858
Five-O!

35:20.859 --> 35:22.609
We're seizing all
this as evidence!

35:22.626 --> 35:24.124
We need to get all
this out of here.

35:24.975 --> 35:26.005
Go through these bags.

35:26.006 --> 35:27.643
This garbage is from the club.

35:41.899 --> 35:43.974
You know, I never
would've left the Island,

35:44.329 --> 35:45.871
I never would've joined the Navy

35:46.022 --> 35:47.977
or missed every holiday,
every birthday,

35:47.978 --> 35:49.270
half of Mary's life.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.595
The day that car exploded,
it made me who I am.

35:54.596 --> 35:55.692
Danny, I can't just

35:55.693 --> 35:57.577
let it go. I'm not
asking you to let it go.

35:57.578 --> 35:59.653
I want to get these
guys as bad as you do.

36:00.054 --> 36:03.000
And we will, we will,
'cause Hiro is getting sloppy.

36:03.001 --> 36:05.498
Waikiki, broad daylight,
a shootout on the beach?

36:05.499 --> 36:06.970
Come on. Yeah, I know,
he's desperate.

36:06.971 --> 36:08.293
He's desperate and stupid.

36:08.656 --> 36:11.179
All right? We will catch these
guys slipping, I promise you.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.596
We just got to wait and
keep grinding on 'em.

36:12.597 --> 36:14.570
They will make a mistake.
Yeah, and

36:14.571 --> 36:16.978
when they do we're gonna
be there for them.

36:18.945 --> 36:20.757
Kono, tell me you got something.

36:20.758 --> 36:23.614
You won't believe this...
I found your dad's toolbox

36:23.615 --> 36:24.885
in the dumpster out back.

36:24.886 --> 36:26.189
The only thing is, it's empty.

36:26.190 --> 36:28.195
All the evidence that was inside gone.

36:28.495 --> 36:31.856
Okay, listen to me,
print it inside and out.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.837
This may be the piece
evidence that connects Hiro

36:33.838 --> 36:35.629
to the break-in and
to Mary's abduction.

36:35.630 --> 36:36.600
Yeah, you got it.

36:54.763 --> 36:55.701
Aw...

36:59.283 --> 37:02.115
Guess there must be a
hole in the security, Koji.

37:02.502 --> 37:05.002
Security's good; it's the
members we got to worry about.

37:12.174 --> 37:13.308
You Koji?

37:16.454 --> 37:19.278
McGarrett, the governor
know you're here?

37:20.469 --> 37:21.857
Yeah, she knows.

37:22.632 --> 37:23.831
She knows everything.

37:26.502 --> 37:27.815
Tell me something.

37:29.183 --> 37:31.409
My father was the
intended target, right?

37:33.646 --> 37:35.350
You didn't mean to
kill my mother, right?

37:35.351 --> 37:36.792
You screwed up, tell me that.

37:36.915 --> 37:38.366
Nice fantasy.

37:39.927 --> 37:41.690
But you don't have any proof.

37:43.007 --> 37:44.344
No evidence at all.

37:45.703 --> 37:47.078
No, I got no proof.

37:48.094 --> 37:49.628
No proof of my mother's murder.

37:54.403 --> 37:55.978
But Mary's kidnapping...

37:56.828 --> 37:58.140
that's where we got you.

37:58.929 --> 38:00.140
You like that glove?

38:01.572 --> 38:03.802
Hmm? That glove, it fit good?

38:03.803 --> 38:04.960
I mean, I think it looks nice.

38:04.961 --> 38:06.423
I think you should
just use it more often,

38:06.424 --> 38:08.187
like when you're
handling stolen property.

38:08.188 --> 38:09.162
You know what I mean?

38:10.449 --> 38:12.369
You touched it.
You opened the box,

38:12.370 --> 38:13.137
you got rid of the evidence,

38:13.138 --> 38:16.094
but you just had to see what my
father had on you, didn't you?

38:18.431 --> 38:19.908
What are you looking at him for?

38:21.408 --> 38:22.675
Don't look at him...
It's not his fault.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.143
It's not your fault, Koji.

38:24.144 --> 38:27.139
Huh? I mean, he did a terrible
job of ditching the evidence,

38:27.140 --> 38:29.234
but you, you are the idiot

38:29.498 --> 38:31.637
that left your prints
all over the lid.

38:31.638 --> 38:32.891
You're under arrest.

38:37.268 --> 38:39.115
Play through for me, McGarrett.

38:39.116 --> 38:41.687
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
A lot can happen

38:41.688 --> 38:43.382
in a couple of hours,
you know what I mean?

38:43.395 --> 38:44.654
It's jail, it ain't the Ritz.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.555
Come on.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.723
I know you rigged that car; I
don't have any proof, but I will.

38:54.724 --> 38:55.911
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

38:55.912 --> 38:57.627
I'm gonna be on you 24/7.

38:58.802 --> 39:02.039
I'm gonna dig up every
skeleton in every closet,

39:02.805 --> 39:04.380
and then I'm coming after you.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.536
You, what's your name?

39:13.811 --> 39:14.786
Wo Fat.

39:15.069 --> 39:16.644
The game's over; go home.

39:16.648 --> 39:17.723
Yes, sir.

39:53.592 --> 39:58.429
WOMAN: Now boarding,
Flight 7013 to Los Angeles,

39:58.430 --> 39:59.427
gate number six.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.297
This is so stupid.

40:06.909 --> 40:08.971
I didn't even want to be here.

40:09.459 --> 40:10.971
Now I don't want to go.

40:12.774 --> 40:15.071
It was kind of starting
to feel like home again.

40:15.383 --> 40:16.078
What are you talking about?

40:16.079 --> 40:17.833
This is always gonna be your home.

40:18.771 --> 40:21.692
But while Koji's a free man,
and until this is over

40:21.693 --> 40:23.757
and I know it's safe
for you to be here...

40:28.519 --> 40:30.335
I'm having a deja vu moment.

40:33.707 --> 40:35.006
It's just like before,

40:35.147 --> 40:36.626
when Dad brought both of us here,

40:36.627 --> 40:39.414
put us on different planes
back to the mainland.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.109
I haven't talked to
you in ten years.

40:47.884 --> 40:49.301
And I never saw Dad again.

40:49.302 --> 40:50.164
Hey.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.528
Hey.

40:53.178 --> 40:55.597
We're gonna see each
other again, okay?

40:55.598 --> 40:56.463
Hey.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.638
We will.

40:58.793 --> 41:00.961
You promise? Yes, I promise.

41:00.962 --> 41:01.875
Come here.

41:09.175 --> 41:13.474
WOMAN : Final boarding call for
Flight 7013 to Los Angeles.

41:13.475 --> 41:15.698
All passengers must be on board

41:15.699 --> 41:18.649
at this time. Call me when you
land in L.A., all right?

41:18.649 --> 41:19.586
I will.

41:19.698 --> 41:20.622
Bye.

41:29.259 --> 41:31.150
Thank you. Have a good flight.

41:40.502 --> 41:41.363
Bye.

42:21.816 --> 42:22.678
Hey.

42:23.810 --> 42:25.585
Where you been?
I called you on your cell.

42:27.697 --> 42:30.635
I had to drop Mary off,
and then I lost track of time.

42:31.298 --> 42:32.685
I'm sorry about that, man.

42:33.922 --> 42:35.572
You got to give her credit.

42:36.385 --> 42:37.904
I mean, she was on to something.

42:37.905 --> 42:39.427
All this stuff in my
father's toolbox...

42:39.428 --> 42:41.102
It's not just about my mom's case.

42:41.103 --> 42:43.256
There's a bunch of other stuff
that's much more current,

42:43.257 --> 42:46.469
like the investigation he was
involved in before Hesse killed him.

42:47.191 --> 42:49.347
We've got a bunch of leads
to follow up on here.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.502
Yeah, well, there's
something we don't have

42:52.503 --> 42:54.807
to follow up on now. What?

42:55.544 --> 42:57.781
Hiro's brother Koji was
found dead an hour ago.

42:58.756 --> 42:59.593
How?

43:00.281 --> 43:01.481
Car accident.

43:01.890 --> 43:02.852
You believe that?

43:05.766 --> 43:06.614
No.
