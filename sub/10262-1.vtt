03:48.880 --> 03:53.192
Get the hell out of my house!

04:09.600 --> 04:11.192
Put that down.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.151
What the hell‘s wrong with you?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.395
Don‘t! Please!

04:15.440 --> 04:17.431
No! For heaven‘s...

04:18.640 --> 04:20.119
No. God. No! Please!

06:04.880 --> 06:06.393
I‘m gonna miss you.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.516
I think you should cancel
your trip to LA.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.834
I really do.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.713
|wi|| if you‘ll
cancel your trial.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.594
lfl do, Mr Murphy goes
to jail for 30 years.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.108
He deserves it.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.835
How could you defend
that son of a bitch, anyway?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.711
Ever hear
of the Sixth Amendment?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.558
He‘s entitled to the best
counsel he can buy...

06:39.600 --> 06:40.828
I mean get.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.554
You got it right
the ﬁrst time, honey.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.676
You have to
understand something.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.871
Mr Murphy doesn‘t see himself
as a son of a bitch.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.797
He gives to charities.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.673
He reads bedtime stories
to his kids.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.875
You‘re breaking my heart, Matt.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.678
Getting slow
in your old age, Gavin?

07:07.600 --> 07:09.591
Thank you for inviting me.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.517
It was Matt‘s idea.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.993
It was?

07:13.040 --> 07:17.079
He couldn‘t believe you never
went to a black-and-white ball.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.031
I had other priorities.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.718
Really?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.591
Is everything Matt‘s idea?

07:24.640 --> 07:26.039
You look beautiful.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.833
Thanks.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.990
lt‘s past your bedtime, David.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.957
I love you, Trina.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.150
Telephone call
for Mr Corelli.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.715
Mr Corelli, there‘s a phone call
for you in the lounge.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.268
Where‘s your phone?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.479
What?

08:09.520 --> 08:10.669
How?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.551
OK. I‘ll be right there.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.955
David, was it something I said?

08:25.160 --> 08:26.559
Kyle Medford‘s dead.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.397
What?!

08:29.400 --> 08:32.392
Oh, my God.
| just saw him today.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.759
You did?

08:33.800 --> 08:36.917
Yes. We talked about the new
Matisse for the museum.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.393
What happened?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.590
He was murdered.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.789
- It‘s a freak show.
- I‘m not here.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.798
- Who‘s in charge?
- Hargrove and Vasko.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.035
- You on call?
- Yep.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.389
You just hit the jackpot.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.956
We guess time of death
about four hours ago.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.433
Want to look upstairs?

09:28.240 --> 09:30.196
Get these people out.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.231
They‘re stepping on evidence.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.354
Black tie, Mr Prosecutor?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.914
Four separate cuts.
Two to the jugular.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.871
Take a look
at this little goody.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.037
Some kind of an African hatchet.

09:45.080 --> 09:49.835
It‘s a fertility mask.
The maid says he collected them.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.075
He was wearing it
when she found him.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.112
The maid came back about eight
after seeing a movie.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.752
She found him like this.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.597
The weapon belongs to him.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.270
It‘ll be tough
to show premeditation.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.151
This is rage.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.990
Make sure we get
some random blood samples.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.759
Let‘s print the toilet.
Maybe he took a leak.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.789
Or she.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.993
Get anything in here?

10:27.040 --> 10:30.032
I got some prints
off the tea set.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.557
We‘ll wrap it.
It won‘t be a problem.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.388
I‘ll send the ID tech guy
the prints.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.078
The lab clear this room?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.235
Yeah, they‘re done.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.353
See if we can get
a hit this time.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.549
That bothers me.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.592
See where he is with his work.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.034
Karen?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.196
Let‘s get these to the lab.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.832
What are they?

11:45.880 --> 11:48.474
Well, either he
collected pubic hair,

11:48.520 --> 11:52.308
or he‘s auditioning
for a Clairol ad.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.400
We‘re all done.
Paramedics are ﬁnishing up.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.237
- We‘re heading out.
- Right.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.635
Don‘t log this until I say, OK?

12:39.680 --> 12:42.513
- What is it?
- I‘ll tell you later.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.959
Prints on the hatchet.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.399
Perfect 14-pointers.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.635
Do | get a warrant
on phone records?

12:47.680 --> 12:48.829
His privacy‘s gone.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.474
The media will make it
into a gangbang.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.397
Everything goes through me.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.158
You gotta be loving this shit.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.349
I‘m sorry?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.755
Next year‘s an election year.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.791
Good to see you.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.511
Good to see you, too, Corelli.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.149
Better bring Clifford
up to speed.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.873
- What are you laughing at?
- I‘m not.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.388
Next year is an election year,
isn‘t it?

13:13.440 --> 13:16.238
Is it? We‘ll talk later.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.157
Yeah. See you.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.708
David, Mr Wong.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.238
Ask Mr Wong
if he recognises this.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.238
It was bought at his store.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.669
It‘s good silver
from Chiang-Su in China.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.631
Did he do the engraving?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.795
No. It was done in Hong Kong.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.875
For who?

14:34.600 --> 14:36.989
It was made for a rich man here.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.793
A gift from a beautiful woman.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.917
Ask him what this means.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.271
It means jade.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.319
Jade.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.637
- Morning, Hal.
- Morning, Mr Gavin.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.432
Thank you.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.910
See you in a couple of days.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.952
OK. I‘ll call you.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.115
Be good.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.310
Always. You be careful.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.237
- Morning, Mrs Gavin.
- Morning.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.669
Would you care for breakfast?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.153
Just some coffee.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.516
We‘re ready, Mrs Gavin.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.835
Father, you are holy, indeed,

15:38.880 --> 15:42.350
and all Creation
rightly gives you praise.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.551
All life, all holiness
comes from you,

15:45.600 --> 15:48.398
through your son Jesus Christ,
our Lord,

15:48.440 --> 15:50.476
by the working of
the Holy Spirit.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.995
From age to age, you gather
people to yourself

15:55.040 --> 15:57.110
so that from east to west,

15:57.160 --> 16:01.199
an offering may be made
to the glory of your name.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.839
And so, Father,
we bring you these gifts.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.714
We ask you to make them holy
by the power of your spirit,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.990
that they may become for us

16:11.040 --> 16:16.114
the body and blood of your son
our Lord Jesus Christ...

16:16.160 --> 16:17.752
What are you doing here?

16:17.800 --> 16:21.190
I took Trina to the airport.
Free for lunch?

16:21.240 --> 16:23.117
You see the papers?

16:23.160 --> 16:25.276
It‘s the case you‘ve been
dreaming about.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.596
It will put your ambitious ass
into the big ofﬁce.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.076
You‘ll be the next DA
of San Francisco.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.599
Where did she go?

16:33.640 --> 16:37.553
- LA for a few days.
- Think she‘s coming back?

16:37.600 --> 16:40.910
Maybe when we get a divorce,
you can marry her.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.871
Cool.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.718
She said you were
a terrible lover.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.433
She lies to protect
your frail ego.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.675
She said that‘s why
she chose me.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.994
Everybody makes mistakes.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.032
You ﬁnally admit that.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.355
- You still playing?
- Sure.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.960
- See you at 1:00?
- Take your best shot.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.398
Medford had money problems.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.318
Last year he lost $8 million
on the yen.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.318
That‘s what he gets
for betting the yen.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.115
And there‘s something else.
We‘ve got a problem.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.549
Only if we make it a problem.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.229
We found a roll of ﬁlm
in Medford‘s safe.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.234
- This a gag?
- No gag.

17:57.280 --> 18:01.558
Those pictures are not relevant
to this investigation.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.318
Who‘s the girl?

18:03.360 --> 18:06.397
Now, that
is a relevant question.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.435
Let‘s ﬁnd her.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.516
We don‘t know anything
about her.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.357
It‘s a waste of time.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.277
We know one thing...

18:14.320 --> 18:16.231
she‘s not a nun.

18:18.280 --> 18:22.398
What about the, um... gentleman?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.954
You want to bring him in?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.230
I‘m not making that call.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.670
I‘ll take care of it, OK?

18:40.600 --> 18:44.070
You‘ve got pictures of the
governor with some hooker?

18:44.120 --> 18:45.712
Keep that to yourself.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.510
- What will you do?
- I‘m seeing him tomorrow.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.551
He could turn you
into road-kill.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.749
No shit.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.870
Why don‘t you come downtown?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.194
As a partner?

18:57.240 --> 18:58.753
Eventually.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.954
What for?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.991
Money. Real money.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.679
I‘m having fun doing what! do.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.315
There‘s only three fun things
in life - money, sex and power.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.316
Two out of three‘s not bad.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.557
Be careful your dream case
don‘t blow your brains out.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.236
What‘s this divorce stuff?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.235
Oh, that.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.669
l was just yanking your chain.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.751
You guys 0K?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.199
Yeah.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.629
Don‘t look so disappointed,
David.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.314
You‘re a cynical
son of a bitch, man.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.351
Yeah, that‘s why we‘re friends.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.637
Governor, Mr Corelli.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.231
Morning, sir.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.636
David. Good to see you.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.830
Always good
to see our rising stars,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.758
even if they‘re plotting
headaches for my friends.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.677
I like your boss.

20:09.720 --> 20:14.032
Word is that you were thinking
about opposing him.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.311
None of us ever run
for anything, do we?

20:17.360 --> 20:20.079
We just allow the party faithful
to draft us.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.076
You know my AA, Bill Barrett?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.758
- Sit down.
- Thanks

20:23.800 --> 20:27.429
I don‘t know how! can help
with Kyle. I liked him.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.596
I‘ve got a meeting
in 10 minutes.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.596
I hoped to see you alone.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.710
l have no secrets from Bill.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.877
He knows where all
the bodies are buried.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.309
There‘s something
I need to show you.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.669
Show me, but quickly.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.113
Push the fucking meeting back
a half-hour.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.434
Yes, sir.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.040
I‘d like to be alone
with David...

21:05.080 --> 21:06.877
with the distinguished
Mr Corelli.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.472
Where did you get these?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.272
Kyle Medford‘s safe.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.633
Son of a bitch.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.076
The miserable cock-sucking
son of a bitch.

22:02.880 --> 22:03.995
Who knows about them?

22:04.040 --> 22:06.554
The investigating ofﬁcers.
My people.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.872
And you, of course.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.399
And me.

22:14.440 --> 22:18.274
If you drag me into this, David,

22:18.320 --> 22:22.632
if my name even shows up
on the periphery of this,

22:22.680 --> 22:25.194
you better get the fuck
out of California

22:25.240 --> 22:27.800
because you‘ll have as much
future as Jerry Brown.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.635
Who‘s Jerry Brown?

22:34.480 --> 22:36.869
Wouldn‘t it be an awful shame

22:36.920 --> 22:40.913
if one little pussy
and a thimbleful of sperm

22:40.960 --> 22:43.599
were to affect the future
of this state?

22:43.640 --> 22:45.995
Was Medford blackmailing you?

22:47.320 --> 22:50.756
I don‘t get blackmailed,
Mr Corelli.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.951
I do the fucking.
I never get fucked.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.276
l have my answer, then.
Thank you for your help.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.959
Any time.
I enjoy dispensing advice

23:01.000 --> 23:03.195
to those who care to listen.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.475
You have other copies,
I presume?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.112
That‘s correct.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.628
Then I‘ll just hold on to these.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.753
Fine. Good to see you again.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.635
Dr Gavin is a psychologist

23:21.680 --> 23:23.989
who specialises
in the causes and treatment

23:24.040 --> 23:26.190
of violence in the workplace.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.028
Herwork‘s been published in the
National Review of Psychiatry

23:30.080 --> 23:33.356
and in hertwo best-selling
works of non-ﬁction.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.392
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr Katrina Gavin.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.154
Good afternoon.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.829
Today l‘ll examine situations
common to your company

23:48.880 --> 23:50.996
and others
in the changing workplace.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.678
It‘s important to distinguish

23:52.720 --> 23:56.395
between someone having a bad day
that ends in a tantrum

23:56.440 --> 23:59.318
and someone whose failure
to resist aggressive impulses

23:59.360 --> 24:02.477
results in serious
destructive acts.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.798
These people are in many ways
no different from you and me,

24:06.840 --> 24:09.718
but they can no longer
control their urges.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.274
They disassociate themselves
from their actions,

24:12.320 --> 24:15.232
often experiencing
an hysterical blindness.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.158
They‘re blind to the darkness
within themselves.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.275
You have reached the law ofﬁces

24:43.320 --> 24:45.356
of Gavin, Terry, and Klorinda.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.073
Ofﬁce hours are 9am to 6pm.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.351
After the beep,
please leave a message.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.038
Hey, it‘s me.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.955
I thought maybe you were working
late, but! guess not.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.719
I‘m so tired
of these things, honey.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.116
lfeel like I‘m disassociating
myself from my own actions.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.192
Maybe I‘m reaching
hysterical blindness.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.755
Hey, be careful. I might give in
to an uncontrollable urge.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.349
Anyway...

25:17.400 --> 25:19.072
I miss you.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.953
How does that make you feel?

25:26.040 --> 25:27.314
Be nice.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.670
You don‘t give a shit
about anyone, do you?

25:31.720 --> 25:34.359
That‘s none of your business.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.989
Governor Edwards called me.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.157
Oh, yeah?

25:47.680 --> 25:50.319
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

25:52.160 --> 25:55.516
The next time you go there,
check with me ﬁrst.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.079
I want you off this case.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.076
Cliff, I am onto something here.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.111
I need a little more time.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.357
I want you off the case.

26:11.320 --> 26:15.029
You take me off this,
and I will go public.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.878
I don‘t think the governor
would appreciate that.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.392
Why don‘t you work it out
and try it yourself?

26:24.440 --> 26:26.317
Maybe I will.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.670
You haven‘t tried a case
in 10 years, Cliff.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.958
Will there be anything else?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.995
Here‘s the governor‘s
lady friend.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.877
She‘s 17 here.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.718
Had to get
into juvenile ﬁles for this.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.910
Patrice Jacinto, 21.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.428
Works for a beauty parlour
in Chinatown.

26:49.480 --> 26:54.508
One arrest for solicitation
when she was a juvenile.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.189
- You talk to her yet?
- No, not yet.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.356
Her bank account shows
two $10,000 deposits

27:00.400 --> 27:01.389
in the last six months.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.518
Medford‘s had this place
a couple of years.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.358
His investment company
leases it.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.557
- Hi, John.
- Vasko.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.070
I bet you can‘t wait
to see the bedroom.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.111
- Corelli.
- Morning.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.070
Deep-seated massage oil.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.830
And over here we have
a harmony pillow.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.110
“This pillow allows
deeper penetration

28:10.160 --> 28:13.391
“by positioning both partners
most advantageously.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.557
“It raises the female hips,
facilitating male entry.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.357
“You can inﬂate the pillow

28:19.400 --> 28:22.233
“to varying degrees
of hardness or softness

28:22.280 --> 28:26.114
“while enjoying the thrill
of ﬂoating action.“

28:28.800 --> 28:30.119
Here in the nightstand,

28:30.160 --> 28:32.594
we got about
three grams of coke...

28:32.640 --> 28:35.473
Some poppers, some assorted
children‘s vitamins...

28:35.520 --> 28:38.239
My best guess is ecstasy.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.352
This is the room the governor
was photographed in.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.153
Maybe it‘s his bridal suite.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.758
You look in here?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.916
Yeah. It‘s been photographed.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.839
Cristalle, Beluga,
Wolfgang Puck...

28:51.880 --> 28:55.270
- It‘s a fuck-house.
- Notjust a fuck-house.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.754
He‘s got a nice
little camera over here...

28:57.800 --> 28:59.950
and there‘s another one
up here...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.230
low-light, high-density.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.317
Neighbour saw
a lot of women come here.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.318
Did you check out these jammin‘
jellies and cliterriﬁcs?

29:08.360 --> 29:10.032
l was thinking about you.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.390
Honey, l‘d rip off
some of those butt plugs.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.510
They‘re designed for
the perfect asshole.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.679
Inspector Vasko.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.670
Take a look at this.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.915
You think the lab can do
anything with that?

29:29.960 --> 29:33.077
- They can try recycling it.
- Great.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.556
What about this neighbour?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.751
Name‘s Guy Henderson. Claims
he never saw Medford here,

29:39.800 --> 29:41.631
but saw women at the house.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.999
Can he identify anybody?

29:43.040 --> 29:45.315
I think he saw more
than he says.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.432
His bedroom faces the house
and he‘s got a scope.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.517
I didn‘t spy on them
or anything.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.915
I‘m sure you didn‘t,
Mr Henderson.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.520
A lot of women came up.
Men, too.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.552
How many different women
you see over there?

29:59.600 --> 30:02.319
I don‘t know.
Five or six, maybe.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.955
Did you ever see any
of these women over there?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.633
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

30:12.680 --> 30:13.874
I think I saw her.

30:16.360 --> 30:16.872
Patrice Jacinto.

30:16.920 --> 30:20.515
She‘s been working in this
beauty parlour for six months.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.870
Fifteen jobs in two years.
Waitress, actress...

30:23.920 --> 30:27.595
You wonder how she put so much
dough in her account.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.439
Ms Jacinto?

30:33.480 --> 30:34.595
Yes?

30:34.640 --> 30:35.675
Could we talk to you?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.597
Yeah. Just a second.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.312
An, shit!

30:45.000 --> 30:46.274
Patrice!

31:00.200 --> 31:02.111
Watch it!

31:38.840 --> 31:39.829
Watch out!

32:02.080 --> 32:03.559
Patrice! Stop!

32:03.600 --> 32:05.352
Patrice! God damn it!

32:05.400 --> 32:07.436
God damn it, hold still!

32:07.480 --> 32:09.914
God damn it!

32:10.960 --> 32:12.473
Here. Here.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.875
Shut up, sweetheart.
You‘re going downtown.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.550
- Fuck!
- Come on, damn it!

32:39.560 --> 32:40.754
My name is David Corelli.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.633
I‘m the assistant DA
in charge of homicide here.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.749
Congratulations.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.994
Thank you.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.355
Something to drink or smoke?

32:49.400 --> 32:52.153
No. They said I couldn‘t
smoke in here.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.792
They were wrong.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.909
Let me tell you how this works.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.396
I know, damn it!
I‘m fucking calling my lawyer!

33:04.440 --> 33:07.079
I can‘t believe
you did this shit!

33:07.120 --> 33:09.634
Look at this!
Look at my face!

33:09.680 --> 33:12.194
Sit down, Patrice.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.595
Now, sit down.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.756
You‘re right. Call your attorney
and say l have a witness

33:25.800 --> 33:29.793
who‘ll identify you visiting
Kyle Medford‘s Paciﬁca house.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.709
Sound familiar? l have pictures
of you fucking the governor

33:34.760 --> 33:38.469
and those pictures will ruin
the governor‘s career.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.398
And you know what‘s going to
happen then, Patrice?

33:41.440 --> 33:46.639
Your attorney will tell you
to go fuck yourself and hang up.

33:54.320 --> 33:58.472
The pay phone is
right out there in the hall.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.871
Wait a minute.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.669
Wait a minute.

34:09.720 --> 34:14.475
I met Kyle at a party
and he knew! was broke,

34:14.520 --> 34:17.910
so he offered me 500 a pop.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.669
I mean, I fuck guys for less.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.631
I‘d go to the Paciﬁca house,

34:23.680 --> 34:26.478
a guy would come
and we‘d spend the night.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.398
They wouldn‘t know me.
I didn‘t know them.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.750
A couple of creeps
didn‘t even want me.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.439
They wanted this other girl
they‘d fucked before.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.879
They called her Jade.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.313
One of those guys
was the governor.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.033
Jade must have rocked his world,

34:45.080 --> 34:48.709
because he wanted me to
bend over and turn around,

34:48.760 --> 34:51.513
but I don‘t take it that way.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.028
He told me that Jade
took it any way.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.719
She couldn‘t get enough.
She loved it.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.639
I saw her once
leaving Kyle‘s house.

35:00.680 --> 35:07.279
She had long, beautiful hair
and great legs.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.390
I think it was her.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.119
I never met her.
I‘d like to, though.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.071
I‘m into women, mostly.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.314
Somebody sawed
through your brake line.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.113
There was no ﬂuid
in your wheel cylinders.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.718
His blood count‘s low.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.399
He‘s lost consciousness,
could have a concussion.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.431
We‘ll have to run some tests.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.153
Somebody up there
loves you, Corelli.

37:18.880 --> 37:21.075
They want to subpoena
my records.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.076
They talked to my CEO.

37:23.120 --> 37:26.556
He‘s pleading to two felony
counts and telling everything.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.154
- What does he know?
- Everything.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.832
You know Vince. He‘s my closest
friend - 20 years.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.108
Who‘s representing him?

37:37.160 --> 37:38.115
Lawton.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.230
- Harry Lawton?
- Yeah.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.390
Has he signed a plea agreement?

37:43.440 --> 37:44.759
I don‘t know.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.677
I know Harry.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.312
Don‘t worry about it.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.191
What do you mean?

37:50.240 --> 37:51.639
He‘s a bullshit artist.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.956
If it wasn‘t for me,
he would have been disbarred.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.195
What am I going to do, Matt?

37:57.240 --> 37:59.231
I‘ve got four kids.

38:00.440 --> 38:04.592
- A trial will kill Sara.
- You will not go to trial.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.393
You will not do one day in jail.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.953
You have my word.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.513
Listen to me.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.199
When they ﬁnd out
I‘m representing you,

38:13.240 --> 38:15.708
this will all go away -
everything, OK?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.349
We made the prints
on the hatchet handle.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.355
Patrice?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.879
No, but we got lucky.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.876
An arrest in Palo Alto in 1980.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.990
Some animal rights protest
at Stanford.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.268
No charges ever ﬁled,

38:27.320 --> 38:29.151
but the Sacramento computer
held prints.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.475
Anna Katrina Maxwell.

38:32.520 --> 38:36.195
We‘re trying to locate her
through the admissions ofﬁce.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.708
- You OK?
- Yeah. I‘m ﬁne.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.557
Nice work.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.159
I appreciate you doing this,
Mr Henderson.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.556
I want to show you
one more set of pictures.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.510
OK. Anybody look familiar?

39:11.560 --> 39:13.357
None of these are familiar.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.277
Nobody from that set. OK.

39:16.320 --> 39:20.199
One more group.
One, two One more.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.469
Yeah. I‘ve seen her.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.637
- The one in the middle?
- Yeah.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.917
Paisan, get in here.

39:33.960 --> 39:34.995
It‘s about time.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.679
Tell Judge Licaldi
l‘ll ring him later.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.199
Come on.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.993
She told you
she saw Medford that day.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.076
They were looking at a Matisse.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.759
Matt, her prints
are on the hatchet.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.109
I got to start at the beginning.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.516
She probably looked at his
collection while she was there.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.754
What are you saying?

39:55.800 --> 39:58.519
To eliminate her,
I need to speak to her.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.949
Fine. She‘ll be back
from LA tomorrow.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.037
- Talk to her.
- Ofﬁcially.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.597
Come on, David... You know her.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.758
You know her as well as I do.
You loved her.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.233
- Still do.
- Cheap shot.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.477
You think she‘d take
a fucking hatchet to somebody?

40:17.520 --> 40:20.990
No, I don‘t, which is why
I need to talk to her.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.874
Fine. Come to the house,
have lunch, then talk to her.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.477
Yes? Can I help you?

41:10.520 --> 41:12.670
Inspector Vas ko,
San Francisco Police Department.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.395
- In the living room, please.
- Thank you.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.149
- Hi, Maria.
- Mr Corelli. Nice to see you.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.355
Cosy little pad.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.233
Yeah. Kind of like
Candlestick Park.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.517
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Hello.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.471
- Inspector Vasko.
- Trina Gavin.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.830
- Hi, Bob Hargrove.
- Hi.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.519
- Matt said you had an accident.
- I‘m ﬁne.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.834
Let‘s get something straight.

41:51.880 --> 41:56.351
Mrs Gavin is only talking to you
because she is not a suspect.

41:56.400 --> 42:00.075
The investigation does not focus
on her at this time.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.588
I think we can live with that.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.518
What‘s your relationship
with Kyle Medford?

42:05.560 --> 42:09.348
I‘m on the board of the Paciﬁc
Museum. Kyle was chairman.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.791
He felt we were too conservative
in our acquisitions program.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.479
I supported his efforts
to be more active.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.317
Did you see him socially?

42:18.360 --> 42:19.918
No, not really.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.872
My husband and I saw him
at various functions.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.911
Did you ever meet alone?

42:26.440 --> 42:29.352
Yes. One time. The day he died.

42:29.400 --> 42:35.316
He called me to talk about
acquiring a new Matisse.

42:35.360 --> 42:41.469
I was leaving town, so I agreed
to meet him at his house.

42:41.520 --> 42:42.953
That was last Saturday?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.513
Yes.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.074
What time did you get there?

42:47.120 --> 42:49.190
I got there around 4:00.

42:49.240 --> 42:51.117
We talked about the Matisse.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.833
He gave me some tea.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.916
He showed me his collection.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.359
Was he alone?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.799
Yes.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.876
Did anyone see you there?

43:00.920 --> 43:02.911
No. I don‘t think so.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.878
What sort of things
did he show you?

43:06.920 --> 43:10.879
He showed me this God-awful mask
from the Cameroon -

43:10.920 --> 43:15.948
I think it was a fertility mask
- and a hatchet.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.753
He said it was over
100 years old.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.597
Did you touch anything?

43:21.680 --> 43:23.477
I touched the hatchet.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.637
The mask, he held it up.

43:26.680 --> 43:31.117
I can‘t remember
whether I touched it or not.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.594
What did you do
after you left?

43:33.640 --> 43:35.278
I went home.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.719
Was your husband here?

43:37.880 --> 43:40.474
- No.
- Was anyone here? Staff?

43:40.520 --> 43:42.715
- No.
- Did you use the phone?

43:42.760 --> 43:46.514
I had the machine on.
I was preparing a speech.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.595
Look, I have no alibi
until 9:00,

43:50.640 --> 43:53.029
when we went to the ball.

43:53.080 --> 43:57.153
- Is that what you‘re asking?
- What else do you need?

43:57.200 --> 44:00.112
Have you ever been
to Medford‘s beach house?

44:01.160 --> 44:05.711
Only his house in the city.
I didn‘t know he had another.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.399
Ever give Medford
a silverjewellery box?

44:08.440 --> 44:10.112
I never gave any gift.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.355
You never had sex with him?

44:12.400 --> 44:13.958
What kind of question is that?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.149
That‘s why they‘re here.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.839
You don‘t have to answer that.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.710
I said I had no social contact
with him.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.753
I do consider sex
to be a social contact, David.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.995
As you know, I‘m married.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.114
lthink she did it.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.513
Why?

44:35.560 --> 44:37.551
No alibi. Prints on the hatchet.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.830
- And she lied.
- Typical shrink.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.677
They pull your strings.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.712
She was pulling your strings
pretty good.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.518
The guy almost
had them convinced...

47:05.560 --> 47:07.391
Morning, Corelli.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.318
Hey, Dave, how you doing?

47:10.360 --> 47:12.954
Got something to show you.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.355
How we doing?

47:15.400 --> 47:19.075
Now this...is what you gave us.

47:19.120 --> 47:22.669
We were able to enhance it
using software algorithms.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.557
Let‘s see...

47:27.880 --> 47:29.757
This is how it looked
when we got it.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.234
Medford‘s beach house.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.558
At least it‘s not
the governor again.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.318
Or the president.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.271
Thank God.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.675
I can still believe in hope.

47:44.720 --> 47:48.110
There‘s some jump cuts,
but we saved a few minutes.

47:52.440 --> 47:55.238
You ever take it
like that, Corelli?

47:55.280 --> 47:57.236
Is that an offer, Inspector?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.679
You wish.

47:58.720 --> 48:02.235
We cleaned it up
a lot more from here on.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.396
Right. Keep working on this,

48:04.440 --> 48:06.431
you‘ll have a PG rating.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.198
Boy, it‘s a wonderful
country, isn‘t it?

48:16.720 --> 48:18.631
Freeze it right there.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.072
Magnify it.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.192
Jesus.

49:04.560 --> 49:05.754
Got a minute?

49:05.800 --> 49:06.755
Yeah.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.509
Miss Jacinto called. She wants
to meet you at 5:00 today.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.710
Tell her Fior d‘ltalia,
Washington Square.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.035
OK. She said it‘s about Jade.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.592
Hey, you asshole!

51:25.800 --> 51:27.791
Get away from her!

51:29.200 --> 51:32.237
Call an ambulance.
Call 911. Code three. Do it!

52:38.760 --> 52:40.637
Hey, you asshole!

53:14.880 --> 53:17.792
Fuck! Fuck!

58:38.960 --> 58:39.949
Shit!

59:04.440 --> 59:08.115
Man, you fucked up!

59:13.440 --> 59:16.034
Medical examiner‘s
case number 3209.

59:16.080 --> 59:18.514
March 16, 1995.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.755
Patrice Jacinto.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.189
There are abrasions
to the chin.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.037
The abrasions
are minimally haemorrhagic

59:25.080 --> 59:27.719
and red to purple in colour.

59:27.760 --> 59:32.038
The neck wound is
of a “y“ conﬁguration -

59:32.080 --> 59:36.153
the horizontal line
being ﬁve inches long

59:36.200 --> 59:37.952
and half an inch in width.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.673
We don‘t have
a talking head any more.

59:40.720 --> 59:43.314
Somebody knew
she was talking to us.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.669
I didn‘t know
you knew the governor.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.314
I don‘t.
I know Bill Barrett. Why?

59:48.360 --> 59:51.909
- Want me to introduce you?
- Go fuck yourself.

59:51.960 --> 59:56.192
- Glad you made her talk?
- What did you say?

59:56.240 --> 59:57.753
You heard it.

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:03.790
I am onto you! I am onto you!

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:06.512
Get off me, Petey!

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.790
I am onto you.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:13.510
You want to tell me about that?

1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:16.312
I can‘t yet.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.638
What is it?

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:24.798
- It‘s a cuff link.
- Don‘t play with me.

1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:27.149
I want to know what it means.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.792
I don‘t know.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.958
What if this comes
up in trial, David?

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.513
There‘ll be questions asked...

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:38.836
Iwould never put
you up for grabs.

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:42.998
You are taking
a huge chance here.

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.749
- So are you.
- Yeah. No shit.

1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:50.920
There was something between
you and Mrs Gavin...

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:52.598
Along time ago.

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:54.631
And you‘re OK with that now?

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:58.877
I hope so.

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:04.552
People who commit these acts are
no different from you and me,

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:07.319
but they can no longer
control their urges.

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:09.715
They disassociate themselves
from their actions,

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:13.469
often experiencing
an hysterical blindness.

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:15.909
They‘re blind to
the darkness within themselves.

1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.629
This is from a speech she made
in LAjust a week ago.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:24.910
We have her prints
on the hatchet.

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:27.793
We have her lying to us
in her statement.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:31.958
She was in Medford‘s house
just before he was killed.

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.039
- She‘s got no alibi.
- We don‘t have a motive.

1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:37.479
What about blackmail?

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.751
The murder weapon wasn‘t hers.
No premeditation.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:44.315
Matt Gavin‘s wife -
he‘ll eat us for breakfast.

1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:47.477
It was her. She did it.

1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:51.229
What make of car killed Patrice?

1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:53.396
Black Thunderbird.

1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:55.510
You didn‘t ID the plates?

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:56.913
No. No plates.

1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.678
What does Mrs Gavin drive?

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:03.351
They‘ve got three cars.
A Jag, a Range Rover...

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:06.119
And a black Thunderbird, right?

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.268
All right, bring her in.

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.596
Just who I wanted to see.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:39.393
Those photographs
you left in Sacramento,

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:42.398
I thought maybe now
that you won‘t need them,

1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:44.908
you could help me
ﬁnd the negatives.

1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:48.428
Why don‘t you help him, Pat?

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:51.278
- Yeah, right.
- Excuse me.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:55.552
Are you putting me on?
What do you need them for?

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.114
They‘re not relevant any more.

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:00.149
Beat it.

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:06.878
Aren‘t you going
to read me my rights?

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.115
You can leave any time.

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:12.869
I‘ve told you about Kyle.
What else is there?

1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:15.195
This is about Jade.

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:27.951
A couple of creeps
didn‘t even want me.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.275
They wanted this girl
they‘d fucked before.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:32.436
They called her Jade.

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:35.233
One of those guys
was the governor.

1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:37.669
Jade must have rocked
his world.

1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:40.757
He wanted me to bend over
and turn around,

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.995
but I don‘t take it that way.

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:47.033
He said Jade took it any way.
She couldn‘t get enough of it.

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.674
What does this have
to do with Katrina?

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:52.837
Could I have
that other tape, please?

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:51.920
Mrs Gavin, is that you?

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.552
That‘s not her!

1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:57.916
- Mrs Gavin?
- You don‘t have to answer.

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.275
I‘m sorry, Matt.

1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:03.117
Fuck you, David!

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:07.275
All right,

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.595
let‘s get on with it.

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:15.552
I met Jim at the museum.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:21.070
I‘d never cheated
on my husband before.

1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:25.989
He took me to a house.
I spent the night with him.

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:27.792
Where?

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:30.070
Paciﬁca.
Some place on the beach.

1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:32.270
Did you have sex with other men?

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:33.309
No.

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:38.914
I cheated on my husband.
I didn‘t know I‘d be arrested.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.393
You‘re not under arrest.

1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:44.149
You never called yourself Jade
or used Medford‘s house?

1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:46.509
Look, bring that girl in here.

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.630
She‘ll tell you
I‘m not that person.

1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:50.318
The girl is dead.

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:57.113
Excuse me.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.036
Would it surprise you to know

1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:04.674
that Medford owned
the Paciﬁca house?

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:05.755
Yes, it would.

1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:09.837
What if a witness
saw you several times?

1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:12.030
I‘d say your witness
was mistaken.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:13.195
Would you?

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:16.789
Where were you yesterday
between ﬁve and six pm?

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:20.719
In the city. I met Matt
for a drink around 5:00.

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.830
Then I went to my ofﬁce.

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:27.271
I returned a few calls
and I got home around 7:45.

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:30.039
- What about Medford?
- What were you driving?

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:33.311
- I asked a question.
- I‘ll do the questions.

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:35.078
- What were you driving?
- My car.

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:39.716
- Black Thunderbird?
- Yes. Anything else?

1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:42.354
Can you be
in a line-up tomorrow?

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:43.515
That‘s enough!

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:46.074
If you‘re charging her,
do it right now!

1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:02.038
Well, I think she had
an uncontrollable urge,

1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:04.799
coupled with
hysterical blindness.

1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:14.312
It‘s time you took yourself
out of this.

1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:23.476
I don‘t understand something.

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:26.398
How could you do this to me?

1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:28.874
How could I do this to you?

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:31.593
- What did you expect?
- Expect?

1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:33.870
I didn‘t expect to go downtown

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:38.391
and sit and watch a tape
of my wife fucking somebody!

1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:41.398
You think I don‘t know
about you?

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.555
Know what?

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:43.874
I know everything.

1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:45.717
I know their names.

1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:49.878
I know about the Fairmont
Towers, sometimes your ofﬁce.

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.911
I‘m not stupid, Matt.

1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.835
Is that why you did it?

1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:14.076
We‘ll check if that‘s blood
on the tyres.

1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:16.076
You‘ll get a comparison
with Patrice‘s?

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:17.109
Yeah, right.

1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:20.236
What about this?
This looks like blood.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.874
Could be paint transfer
from an impact.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:24.831
This is the car, Petey.

1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:27.872
This car was reported stolen
about a week ago.

1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:30.514
Belongs to some
computer company executive.

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.074
Not Mrs Gavin‘s car.

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:35.588
Maybe somebody wants us
to think it was.

1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:40.835
This is the car, Petey.

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:42.791
This is the car.

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:39.116
What, did the tape
turn you on?

1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:50.479
Don‘t ever talk
to me like that again!

1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:52.511
Do you understand me?

1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:30.677
What are you doing here?

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.836
I need to talk to you.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:34.632
I can‘t. You know that.

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:36.955
I need your help, David.
I‘m afraid.

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.592
Afraid of what?

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:41.671
Who am I speaking to?

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.597
Can I come in?

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.553
Come on in.

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:00.596
I didn‘t know Kyle
was taping any of it.

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:05.555
I knew they were powerful, but
I had no idea he was using them.

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:08.797
He told me they were
friends of his.

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:10.831
How many were there?

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:15.756
A lot. I don‘t know.
I lost track.

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:18.268
How could you let them do that?

1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:20.038
They didn‘t do anything.

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:22.196
It was my choice. I liked it.

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:25.198
- And Matt?
- I don‘t fuck him that way.

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.835
That‘s not what! mean.
What did you tell him?

1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.632
Nothing.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.355
He only knows
about the man on the tape.

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.596
Who were the others?

1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:47.756
Men with money...

1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:49.074
reputations.

1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:54.114
I didn‘t have to fall in love
with them, David.

1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:57.355
It was safe.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:59.391
At least, I thought it was.

1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:04.599
David, I know too much.

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:08.748
One of them killed Kyle
and Patrice.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:11.473
- I could be next.
- You should go.

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:15.308
I know too much!
I know you love me.

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:18.397
Don‘t do this. Don‘t do this.

1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:10.029
Nothing‘s changed.

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.911
Everything‘s changed.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.598
What?

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.437
You killed Medford.

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:25.111
Where are you going?

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:51.754
San Francisco DA.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:52.949
All right.

1:14:57.720 --> 1:14:59.119
No.

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.390
There‘s our last link to Jade.

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.998
Anyone who‘s ever
seen her is dead

1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:06.235
or suffering
from penile amnesia.

1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:07.998
Jade doesn‘t exist any more.

1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:10.759
Careful. You nearly stood
on the murder weapon.

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:13.109
He was obviously
killed with that.

1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:15.594
There doesn‘t appear
to be forced entry.

1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:19.269
His brother came for dinner,
found the body...

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.311
The brother has a key.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:23.595
He‘s still warm.

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:25.551
He‘s only been dead an hour.

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:27.431
- How long?
- An hour.

1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:30.950
- Where‘s the phone?
- It‘s right up there.

1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.837
Your friend Trina
sure gets around.

1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:35.552
She couldn‘t have done this.

1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:39.036
- Why not?
- She was with me.

1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:41.389
Maria! Maria, it‘s Mr Corelli.

1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:44.079
Yes. Is Mrs Gavin home?

1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:47.556
No. OK. How about Mr Gavin?

1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:52.754
OK, would you tell Mr Gavin
that I will be at my apartment?

1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:54.358
Right. Thanks. Maria.

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:56.391
Where are you going?

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.630
Stop! Stop!

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.752
Stop!

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:23.438
Hello? Hello? Hell...

1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:27.111
You fucked her, didn‘t you?

1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:29.151
Matt, where is she?

1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:31.509
Matt, where is she?
She‘s in trouble.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:14.035
Maria, are you in your room?

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:25.591
Anybody here?

1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:27.916
This is Katrina Gavin,
1100 Hillsborough.

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.359
No. Hillsborough.

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:32.789
Talking to one
of your boyfriends?

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:38.234
David, watch it!

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:01.598
You like it like this,
don‘t you?

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:04.951
Let her go!

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:40.795
Who‘s there?

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.069
It‘s a tragedy for justice when
law enforcement people go bad.

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:24.078
They were cleaning up your shit.

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:29.228
They were just
two loyal supporters...

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.993
Two supporters
who got carried away.

1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:37.431
They wanted to see if she had
more pictures of the governor.

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:40.392
They acted on their own
out of misguided loyalty.

1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:44.638
Kyle Medford was shaking
you down and was killed for it.

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:47.148
Patrice was in those pictures.
She was next,

1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:49.236
then Henderson,
who could ID everybody.

1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:51.271
That left Trina Gavin.

1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:53.595
Why are you wasting
the governor‘s time?

1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:56.198
Anything happens to Trina Gavin,

1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:59.073
I have ﬁlm
of you and a dead hooker.

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:07.829
And what if something
happens to you?

1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:15.554
Leave her alone.

1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.915
Get the fuck out of here.

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:25.313
Ready, darling?

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.237
We‘re going to be late.

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:31.435
Where did you get these?

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.836
Kyle Medford showed me
the day before I killed him.

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:37.952
You knew, and you killed him?

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.672
He was a scumbag.

1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:42.518
He would have taken us
both down.

1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.915
I told you...

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:48.758
I will never let
anyone hurt you.

1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:54.553
But I don‘t remember any of it.

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:56.955
You know what I think it is?

1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.389
Hysterical blindness.

1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:05.595
Do me a favour, Trina.

1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:08.871
Next time we make love,

1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:12.151
you introduce me to Jade.
