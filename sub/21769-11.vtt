WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.970
I LOVE THESE CINNAMON
CHEDDAR BAGEL CHIPS,

00:03.036 --> 00:06.240
EVEN THOUGH EVERY COLOR
AND FLAVOR IN THEM
IS ARTIFICIAL.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.711
YOU LOVE THEM
BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:11.111 --> 00:14.214
CHEMICALS FIX WHAT
NATURE DIDN'T DO RIGHT.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.552
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST THING TO SAY

00:18.619 --> 00:20.821
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A COMMUNITY GARDEN.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.156
OKAY, FINE,
ORGANIC PEOPLE,

00:23.223 --> 00:24.892
YOU WIN.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.896
- I'M THROWING THEM OUT.
- NO NO NO!

00:28.962 --> 00:32.699
THE CHEESY CHEMICAL DUST
AT THE BOTTOM IS MY
FAVORITE PART.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.003
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET THESE EGGS

00:36.069 --> 00:39.239
FOR AUNT HONEY AND GO BACK
TO WHERE PEOPLE SHOWER.
( SNIFFS )

00:39.306 --> 00:42.209
AUNT HONEY NEEDS EGGS?
WHAT DRINK HAS
AN EGG IN IT?

00:42.276 --> 00:44.211
YEAH, I ASKED HER
THE SAME QUESTION

00:44.278 --> 00:46.046
AND SHE SAID IT WAS
ONE PART VODKA,

00:46.113 --> 00:48.749
TWO PARTS JUST-BUY-
ME-SOME-DAMN-EGGS.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.853
- HELLO.
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.054
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN DO FOR ME?

00:54.121 --> 00:58.525
YOU CAN TELL ME HOW THIS
DUSTY OVERPRICED TOMATO

00:58.592 --> 01:00.460
IS BETTER THAN THE ONE
IN MY DELI.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.030
THAT THING AT THE DELI
ISN'T A TOMATO.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.032
IT WAS GROWN
ON A FACTORY FARM
1,000 MILES FROM HERE,

01:05.098 --> 01:07.034
PICKED BY A MACHINE
BEFORE IT WAS RIPE.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.638
THIS ONE I GREW
WITH MY OWN HANDS
RIGHT OVER THERE.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.107
I HAVE A CONNECTION
WITH THIS TOMATO.

01:14.174 --> 01:15.042
AND WHEN YOU BITE
INTO IT,

01:15.108 --> 01:18.445
WHICH I ENCOURAGE
YOU TO DO...

01:20.547 --> 01:22.950
I'LL HAVE A CONNECTION
WITH YOU.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.291
( SLURPING )

01:34.895 --> 01:37.130
WHOO!

01:37.197 --> 01:39.433
I FEEL ALL TINGLY.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.337
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU
ARE ALLERGIC TO TOMATOES.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.906
SHH,
IT'S WORTH IT.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.842
- IT IS WORTH IT.
- THAT'LL BE $7.
OR--

01:48.909 --> 01:51.044
IT WOULD BE IF WE WERE
CHARGING BEAUTIFUL
LADIES TODAY,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.881
WHICH WE ARE NOT.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.684
IS IT REALLY WORTH IT,
I MEAN, $7?

01:57.751 --> 02:00.020
WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR
IS THE NUTRIENT-RICH SOIL

02:00.087 --> 02:03.056
WITH A PERFECT BALANCE
OF NITROGEN AND FATTY OILS.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.427
I SHOULD KNOW.
I SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS
IN THE LAB PERFECTING IT.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.331
IN THE LAB?
GIMME THAT.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.106
- NOW I FEEL ALL TINGLY.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

02:21.208 --> 02:22.910
I'M JEB.
THIS IS AMOS.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.712
I'M GEORGIA. THIS IS JO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.484
BOTH:
OKAY, I LIKE THIS GUY.
I NEED YOU TO PLAY ALONG.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.319
PERFECT! WAIT.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.721
WHICH GUY DO YOU LIKE?
THE CUTE ONE.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.023
OKAY, STOP.
I LIKE JEB.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.592
OH, PERFECT,
'CAUSE I LIKE AMOS.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.960
PERFECT.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.695
BOTH: WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO OUT SOMETIME?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.964
( LAUGHS )
LIKE A DOUBLE-DATE?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.899
THAT'S FUNNY,
BUT WE WEREN'T

02:45.966 --> 02:49.069
TALKING ABOUT THAT
IN OUR HUDDLE AT ALL.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.738
- WAIT, I THOUGHT
WE JUST SAID-- OH.
- JO, JO.

02:51.805 --> 02:55.042
YEAH, WE COULD ALL
GO OUT IF YOU WANT.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.343

<i>YEAH.</i>

YOU GUYS LIKE TO--

WE'RE DOWN.
WE'RE DOWN.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.085
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

03:16.129 --> 03:19.299
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE
DATE BEFORE.N A DOUBLE

03:19.366 --> 03:21.935
THE GUYS THAT I DATE,
AREN'T INTO SCIENCEY

03:22.002 --> 03:24.037
AND THEN THE GUYS
( CLEARS THROAT )LL...

03:24.104 --> 03:26.306
THERE'S OUR PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.843
STINGS, BUT TRUE.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.514
WELL, IT IS EXCITING
WE'RE INTERESTED IN.YS

03:33.580 --> 03:34.047
IF THIS WORKS OUT,

03:34.114 --> 03:36.517
WE COULD HAVE
A DOUBLE WEDDING.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.018
BEFORE WE RENT THE CHURCH,
BEST FRIEND DOUBLE-DATING

03:38.085 --> 03:40.687
IS VERY TRICKY, ALL RIGHT?

03:40.754 --> 03:43.257
WE HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE
THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.460
OKAY, RIGHT, SAME PAGE.
WHEN DO WE KISS THEM?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.529
Y-YOU DIDN'T
DO THAT ALREADY?

03:48.595 --> 03:51.131
AW MAN, NO.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.034
SEE, THIS IS WHAT
IT'S VERY VERY TRICKY.

03:54.101 --> 03:58.338
OUR RELATIONSHIPS HAVE
THE SAME PACE. EXACTLY

03:58.405 --> 04:00.807
LIKE, WHAT IF I STOP
LIKING MY GUY, RIGHT?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.176
BUT YOU STILL LIKE YOURS.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.043
THEN YOUR GUY
WILL STOP LIKING ME.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.445
AND THEN IT GETS
REALLY WEIRD

04:05.512 --> 04:07.981
AND THEN SUDDENLY
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.184
- WAIT, WHAT?
- I KNOW, I KNOW.PPEN?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.818
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
TO MY WORDS--

04:11.885 --> 04:13.353
"VERY VERY TRICKY,"
ALL RIGHT?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.189
WE ARE DATING
AS A UNIT NOW.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.158
IF WE GO IN TOGETHER,
AND IF NEED BE,

04:18.225 --> 04:20.827
- WE GET OUT TOGETHER.

TRUST ME,
UNTIL YOU'VE SIPPED IT

04:27.100 --> 04:30.537
FROM AN ACTUAL
OSTRICH EGG.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.408
MARTHA TAUGHT ME THIS
DURING OUR TIME
IN THE BIG HOUSE.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.343
YOU WENT TO JAIL
WITH MARTHA STEWART?

04:36.410 --> 04:39.980
NO, MY BIG HOUSE
IN THE HAMPTONS.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.115
WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS
DOING TONIGHT?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.051
WELL, I KNOW IT'S
HARD TO BELIEVE,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.186
BUT THERE IS A DOUBLE
DATE HAPPENING.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.789
OH, A LADY
AND TWO GENTLEMEN.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.259
OH, THAT TAKES ME BACK.

YOU KNOW, THE FRENCH
HAVE A TERM FOR THAT.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.131
NO NO NO.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.235
TWO GIRLS AND TWO GUYS.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.103
OH! THE FRENCH HAVE
A TERM FOR THAT TOO.

05:10.511 --> 05:14.615
HMM, I UNDERSTAND NOW
WHY YOU GUYS ONLY
EAT ORGANIC.

05:14.681 --> 05:18.218
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
ARTICHOKE HAD A TASTE.
TASTE.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.888
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A HARDER WAY
TO DRINK BUTTER.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.890
WAIT TILL YOU TRY
OUR SAFFRON.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.892
NO ONE ELSE IN
THE CITY'S GROWING IT.

OH, I JUST LOVE
HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE
ABOUT YOUR WORK

05:29.530 --> 05:32.032
AND ABOUT WORKING OUT,
I'M GUESSING.

05:32.099 --> 05:36.470
WE DIG HOW MUCH
YOU GUYS ARE INTO THE WHOLE
SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.907
PSSH, WHY WOULDN'T WE BE?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.542
THE WAY YOU ASKED
ABOUT THE TOMATO,

05:41.608 --> 05:44.144
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
A COUPLE OF JUNK-FOOD-EATING
MANHATTAN GIRLS

05:44.211 --> 05:45.112
WHO CAME DOWN TO LAUGH
AT THE FARMERS.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.318
THAT IS JUST WAY OFF
THE MARK, REALLY.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.922
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON
WE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE TOMATO

05:54.988 --> 05:57.958
WAS BECAUSE, UH--

05:58.025 --> 06:01.128
- TO SEE--
- IF YOU GUYS WERE...

06:03.564 --> 06:06.099

- REAL...

06:06.166 --> 06:09.169
THING.
THE REAL THING.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.037
TO SEE IF YOU GUYS
WERE THE REAL THING.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.906
IT'S AS SIMPLE
AS THAT, REALLY,

06:12.973 --> 06:14.708
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
EVEN FROM MANHATTAN.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.778
WE'RE FROM GEORGIA.
SOIL IS IN OUR BLOOD.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.516
YEAH, OUR BLOOD
IS ALL OVER THAT SOIL.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.719
NO NO NO.
WHAT SHE MEANS
IS THAT WE GROW THINGS.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.487
SO WHAT DO YOU GROW?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.556
WHAT DO WE GROW?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.759
WHAT DON'T WE GROW,
REALLY?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.061
YOU KNOW, JO, WE HAVE LIKE
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.730
- LIKE--
- CARROTS.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.066
YEAH, AND LETTUCE
TO GO WITH THE CARROTS.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.903
AND A LITTLE BIT OF--

06:42.970 --> 06:44.972
- A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE.
- CHEESE?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.708
CHEESE?

06:47.774 --> 06:49.042
COOL.
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOAT?

06:49.109 --> 06:52.813
APPARENTLY WE DO.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.483
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING
SMALLER THAT MAKES CHEESE.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.753
WOW, SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE
A WHOLE URBAN FARM GOING ON.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.756
- YEAH, SURE DOES.
- YES.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.325
WE'D LOVE TO CHECK
IT OUT SOMETIME.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.194
ARE YOU GUYS FREE SATURDAY?

07:07.261 --> 07:09.496
TO COME OVER
TO OUR APARTMENT FARM?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.066
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE'RE BUSY
THAT DAY, RIGHT, JO?

07:13.133 --> 07:16.036
- RIGHT RIGHT.
- YEAH.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.105
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY?

07:20.207 --> 07:21.608
- SOUNDS GREAT.
- SURE.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.378
YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.
IT REALLY DOES.

07:24.444 --> 07:29.116
A DAY SOONER TO SEE
OUR FULLY FUNCTIONING
URBAN FARM.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.658
GEORGIA, WHERE SHOULD
I PLANT THE KALE?

07:37.724 --> 07:40.127
TWO DAYS AGO I WOULD HAVE SAID
"WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE."

07:42.196 --> 07:44.932
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
REALLY ENJOYING THIS.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.335
AND I THINK YOU ACTUALLY
DO PLANT IT WHERE THE SUN
DON'T SHINE.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.438
I KNOW THAT WE DID THIS
JUST TO IMPRESS THE GUYS,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.040
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M REALLY INTO IT.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.809
DO YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS

07:55.876 --> 07:57.945
SINCE I'VE HAD A CINNAMON
CHEDDAR BAGEL CHIP?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.046
OH MY GOODNESS, ME TOO!

07:59.112 --> 08:02.916
I DON'T EVEN THINK MY BODY
WOULD LIKE THAT PROCESSED
STUFF ANYMORE ACTUALLY.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.052
I FEEL SO CONNECTED
TO THE EARTH.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.223
THIS IS THE WAY NATURE
INTENDED US TO LIVE.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.060
I KNOW, RIGHT?
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS
A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.128
URBAN FARMING
OR DOUBLE-DATING?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.031
- BOTH.
- YEAH.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.235
LADIES, LADIES,
SOMEONE WANNA TELL ME

08:21.301 --> 08:24.137
WHAT THIS WEIRD DOG
WAS DOING IN MY WIG ROOM?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.038
IT ATE MY PATTI LABELLE

08:25.105 --> 08:28.542
AND IS TRYING TO MATE
WITH MY TINA TURNER.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.158
JO, THE BOYS
WILL BE HERE SOON.
LET'S FINISH THE SALAD.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.196
- I'VE GOT CARROTS.
- OH.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.565
I MEAN CARROT.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.169
JO, WHAT HAPPENED?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.838
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT CARROTS

08:57.905 --> 09:01.909
NEED MORE THAN
THREE DAYS TO GROW.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.045
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT GROWING CARROTS.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.815
WELL, THE SALAD WILL
BE SMALL, ALL RIGHT?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.885
BUT AT LEAST WE
WILL MAKE IT UP WITH
THE HOMEMADE GOAT CHEESE.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.859
- ABOUT THAT--
- JO, COME ON NOW.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.694
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA MILK THE GOAT

09:20.761 --> 09:23.864
AND THEN SOMEHOW
TURN THAT INTO CHEESE.

09:25.199 --> 09:28.735
WELL, AFTER A LOT
OF HANDS-ON RESEARCH,

09:28.802 --> 09:31.438
I'VE DETERMINED THAT

09:31.505 --> 09:33.740
WE DID NOT BUY
A GIRL GOAT.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.678
WELL, I SAW A NIPPLE.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.747
THAT'S RIGHT,
ONE NIPPLE.

09:43.317 --> 09:46.486
WELL, IF LIVING SUSTAINABLY
WAS EASY, THEN EVERYBODY
WOULD DO IT.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.689
AND THAT REMINDS ME,

09:48.755 --> 09:51.458
CAN YOU CHECK
AND MAKE SURE NONE
OF THAT GROSS FOOD

09:51.525 --> 09:53.527
WE USED TO EAT
IS STILL IN THE KITCHEN?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.463
YOU MEAN THAT ARTIFICIALLY
FLAVORED PACKAGED STUFF

09:56.530 --> 09:58.298
THAT WE USED
TO THINK WE LIKED?

09:58.365 --> 10:01.368
- I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S ALL BEEN THROWN OUT.
-<i>OKAY, GOOD.</i>

10:01.435 --> 10:04.404
- I'LL GO DOUBLE-CHECK.
- OKAY, COOL. I'M GONNA
START MY MAKEUP.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.906
AREN'T YOU GONNA GO
WITH THE NATURAL LOOK?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.208
MAKING IT LOOK LIKE
I'M NOT WEARING MAKEUP

10:08.275 --> 10:09.776
TAKES LIKE TWICE AS LONG.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.779
OH, SHOULD I DO MINE?

10:12.846 --> 10:15.582
MM, NO, I THINK
YOU GOT IT DOWN.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.367
JOSEPHINA PYE!

10:33.433 --> 10:35.969
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT BAG OF CHIPS?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.038
WHAT CHIPS?
WHO AM I?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.107
HOW DID I GET
IN THIS CLOSET? WHAT?

10:41.575 --> 10:44.611
- JO.
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.280
I LIKE THESE THINGS.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.248
THEY'RE BETTER THAN
ANYTHING--<i>ANYTHING</i>

10:48.315 --> 10:50.050
THAT'S EVER GROWN
FROM THE EARTH.

10:51.552 --> 10:53.654
- YOU WANT SOME?
- NO.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.023
YOU DISGUST ME.

10:56.089 --> 11:00.827
I JUST-- I CAN'T EVEN BE
IN THE SAME ROOM

11:00.894 --> 11:02.763
- AS YOU RIGHT NOW.
- UH EH!

11:02.829 --> 11:05.132
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING
BACK THERE?

11:05.199 --> 11:06.934
GEORGIAFINA CHAMBERLAIN!

11:09.336 --> 11:12.806
HELP ME!
I MISS THEM SO MUCH.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.641
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT,
REALLY.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.678
- IT'S NOT?
- MM-MM. WE GREW UP
ON PROCESSED FOOD.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.680
YOU COULD SAY THAT
WE NEED IT TO SURVIVE.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.315
YEAH YEAH,
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED

11:21.381 --> 11:24.017
TO LIVE LIKE
OUR ANCESTORS.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.786
IT'S EVOLUTION.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.756
WELL, NOT REALLY,
BUT OKAY.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.093
SO I GUESS OUR
SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE IS--

11:33.160 --> 11:35.629
UNSUSTAINABLE.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.764
WE CAN'T KEEP
LIVING LIKE THIS.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.867
THE COMPOST HEAP SMELLS.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.669
I CRY AT FROZEN
PIZZA COMMERCIALS.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.405
MY PEE HAS CHANGED COLORS.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.276
WE HAVE TO BREAK UP
WITH JEB AND AMOS.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.278
WE'RE NOT THE GIRLS
THAT THEY THINK WE ARE.

11:51.345 --> 11:53.280
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:53.347 --> 11:55.749
IN TOGETHER,
OUT TOGETHER.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.652
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
GO DOWN TO THE GARDEN
AND BREAK UP WITH THEM

11:58.719 --> 12:01.221
AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD
GO GET LIKE A BURGER

12:01.288 --> 12:02.890
WITH A HOT DOG ON TOP?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.259
CAN I EAT THE CHEESY
CHEMICAL DUST PART FIRST?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.261
I WAS SORT OF LOOKING
FORWARD TO THAT.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.696
- NO JUDGMENT HERE.
- ( CRUNCHING )

12:09.763 --> 12:12.065
OH MY GOODNESS!
NO, YOU DID NOT!

12:12.132 --> 12:14.801
THIS IS A CLOSET,
NOT A PETTING ZOO!

12:14.868 --> 12:17.804
OH, BRING IT ON!
BRING IT-- BRING IT ON!

12:23.911 --> 12:28.048
OKAY, YOU SAW HOW EASY
IT WAS, THE DOUBLE-DATING
WHEN WE STAYED IN SYNC.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.818
SAME THING GOES
FOR DOUBLE-DATE
BREAKUP, ALL RIGHT?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.755
NOBODY FREESTYLES
OR EVERYTHING JUST
FALLS APART.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.823
I KNOW. I'M READY.
I'M READY.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.459
AMOS, YOU'RE
A REALLY GREAT GUY.

12:39.526 --> 12:44.264
- BUT?
- BUT I DON'T THINK I'M READY
TO GET SERIOUS RIGHT NOW.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.835
OH YES!
JUST STICK TO THE SCRIPT
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.907
- HEY.
- HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.877
WE WERE JUST PACKING UP
AND GETTING READY TO HEAD
TO YOUR PLACE.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.213
YOU LOOK GREAT, JO.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.983
I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE
WOULD SAY THAT THE OVERALLS
MAKE YOU LOOK ANDROGYNOUS,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.752
BUT I THINK ANDROGYNOUS
IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.323
OKAY, LET'S GET
THIS STARTED.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.927
WHY DON'T YOU ROLL OVER
WITH ME TO THE ROLLS?

13:15.329 --> 13:16.763
I AM SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.700
MARIO BATALI CAME BY
TO LOOK AT OUR SAFFRON.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.802
HE WANTS TO USE IT
IN ALL OF HIS RESTAURANTS.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.638
THIS IS AN URBAN
FARMER'S DREAM.

13:24.705 --> 13:27.708
THAT'S AMAZING.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.477
SOME PART OF ME THINKS
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING

13:30.544 --> 13:32.112
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN MY LIFE.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.616
THAT'S STATISTICALLY
UNLIKELY.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.820
- BUT, AMOS...
- JEB...

13:39.887 --> 13:41.922
GEORGIA AND JO:
I THINK YOU'RE A REALLY
GREAT GUY, BUT--

13:41.989 --> 13:43.690
- AMOS: I LOVE YOU.
- WHAT?!

13:43.757 --> 13:45.526
I LOVE YOU TOO.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.728
- GEORGIA: OH, MAN!
- JEB: WHAT?

13:47.794 --> 13:49.363
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.765
UH, I'LL SEE YOU
AT DINNER? OKAY.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.145
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR DINNER, GUYS.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.514
THOSE WHEATGRASS, KALE
AND SPINACH SHAKES
WERE AWESOME.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.683
YEAH YEAH,
I WASN'T THINKING

14:09.750 --> 14:11.518
ABOUT A REAL SHAKE
AT ALL.

14:11.585 --> 14:17.324
YOU KNOW, JUST SIPPING
ON MY LAWN.

14:17.391 --> 14:20.961
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU ABOUT
YOUR INDOOR COMPOST HEAP.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.064
MOST PEOPLE
PUT IT OUTSIDE,

14:24.131 --> 14:26.667
OR AT LEAST HAVE A LID.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.104
WELL, WE'RE NOT
MOST PEOPLE.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.775
ALTHOUGH WE WOULD BE
IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE DONE
A LITTLE BIT MORE RESEARCH.

14:36.677 --> 14:39.713
SO WE'LL SEE
YOU GUYS SOON?

14:39.780 --> 14:42.716
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE PROBABLY SO BUSY

14:42.783 --> 14:46.854
- WITH ALL YOUR SAFFRON
STUFF AND STUFF.
- YEAH.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.256
AND IF YOU NEED JUST
SOME TIME TO YOURSELVES,

14:49.323 --> 14:51.225
WE ARE SO LOW MAINTENANCE.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.828
WE COULD ACTUALLY BE
LIKE NO MAINTENANCE.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.930
WE COULD GO WEEKS
WITHOUT SEEING YOU.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.800
WE'RE LIKE
RELATIONSHIP CAMELS.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.937
CRAZY.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.507
OKAY.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.010
OOH!

15:10.077 --> 15:12.546
LOVE YOU.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.916
LOVE YOU TOO.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.187
THANK YOU. OH!
STOP SAYING THAT!

15:20.254 --> 15:22.222
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T WANNA BE RUDE.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.025
YOU CAN'T JUST LET
AN "I LOVE YOU" HANG
THERE LIKE THAT.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.395
OH, BUT YOU CAN.
LET'S PRACTICE, OKAY?
I LOVE YOU.

15:28.462 --> 15:30.898
- I LOVE YOU TOO.
- NO!

15:30.964 --> 15:35.169
GIRLS, WHATEVER YOU'RE
DOING IN THIS APARTMENT
HAS GOT TO STOP.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.539
IF A FOOT HAD AN ARMPIT
AND AN ARMPIT HAD AN ASS,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.507
IT WOULD SMELL BETTER
THAN IT DOES IN HERE.

15:43.844 --> 15:45.812
NOW HOW LONG
ARE YOU GIRLS PLANNING

15:45.879 --> 15:48.615
ON KEEPING UP
THIS HILLBILLY ROUTINE?

15:48.682 --> 15:51.318
WELL, I THINK THAT
THE APPROPRIATE
AMOUNT OF TIME

15:51.385 --> 15:53.720
THAT NEEDS TO PASS
AFTER "I LOVE YOUS"
HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED

15:53.787 --> 15:56.590
IS LIKE THREE
TO FOUR MONTHS.

15:56.657 --> 15:58.392
NO. NO NO NO NO.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.095
SEE, I DON'T EVEN
DATE A GUY I LIKE FOR
THREE TO FOUR MONTHS.

16:02.162 --> 16:06.133
SORRY, BUT IN TOGETHER,
OUT TOGETHER, REMEMBER?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.403
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO LET AMOS DOWN GENTLY.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.906
LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY
OF LETTING A MAN DOWN GENTLY.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.043
NOW YOU PICTURE
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN HER PRIME.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.012
SHE MEETS A MAN.
HE FALLS FOR HER, OF COURSE.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.548
AND WHEN HE SAYS
HE LOVES HER,

16:21.615 --> 16:24.918
SHE'S TOO POLITE
TO SHUT IT DOWN.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.487
SHE THINKS THE LUGHEAD
IS JUST GONNA GO AWAY,
BUT HE DOESN'T.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.489
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW
THEY'RE MARRIED.

16:29.556 --> 16:33.527
SHE'S STUCK WASTING
THE BEST YEARS OF HER LIFE.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.598
SO WHICH ONE OF YOUR
HUSBANDS WAS THIS ONE?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.400
OH, IT WASN'T ME.
I HANDLE MY BUSINESS.

16:40.467 --> 16:44.605
IT WAS MY POOR FRIEND
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.779
AW, MAN,
THEY'RE NOT HERE YET.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.549
YOU'RE BETTER AT THIS
THAN I AM. CAN'T WE
JUST SEND THEM A TEXT?

16:55.616 --> 16:59.052
NO NO, SEE,
THE SINGLE BREAKUP
TEXT-- SIMPLE.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.256
BUT THE DOUBLE-DATING
BREAKUP TEXT-- WORD
GETS AROUND.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.426
OH MY GOODNESS!

17:06.493 --> 17:08.462
OH, LOOK,
THEY'RE GROWING FLOWERS.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.597
THEY MUST BE GROWING
THEM FOR US.

17:10.664 --> 17:13.634
DAMN, THAT MEANS WE NEED
TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.603
HUH-UH. NO NO NO.
I AM NOT WAITING A WEEK,

17:16.670 --> 17:19.239
EVEN IF THEY WERE GROWING
GUCCI GIFT CARDS.

17:19.306 --> 17:23.010
ALL RIGHT?
BESIDES, THAT SOIL
IS REAL DRY.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.512
ONE WEEK OF FARMING

17:25.579 --> 17:28.115
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE AN EXPERT?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.519
DUDE, I KNOW WHAT
DRY SOIL LOOKS LIKE.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.555
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT
A GOAT NIPPLE LOOKS LIKE.

17:36.924 --> 17:40.027
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT IS VERY DRY.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.596
THEY WERE PROBABLY SO BUSY
WITH ALL THEIR FANCY VEGETABLES

17:42.663 --> 17:44.932
AND THEIR SAFFRON
THAT THEY FORGOT ABOUT
THESE FLOWERS.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.867
YEAH.
WHY DON'T YOU HAND ME
THAT HOSE OVER THERE

17:46.934 --> 17:49.670
SO THEY DON'T LOSE
THEIR GIRLFRIENDS AND
THEIR GARDEN IN ONE DAY.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.140
I'M NERVOUS.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.042
LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,
JUST WALK UP TO THEM

17:55.108 --> 17:58.545
AND BE LIKE, "HEY,
WE'RE BREAKING UP WITH YOU"?

17:58.612 --> 18:01.582
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
LET'S PRACTICE AGAIN.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.484
I LOVE YOU.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.253
I DON'T SHARE
THAT FEELING.

18:07.988 --> 18:09.857
RIGHT. MARRY ME.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.059
- OKAY.
- NO!

18:12.125 --> 18:14.361
IT'S MY FIRST TIME
BEING ASKED.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.297
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE ARE NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.667
I AM STANDING RIGHT
NEXT TO YOU WHEN THIS
GOES DOWN, OKAY?

18:20.734 --> 18:22.803
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

18:22.870 --> 18:24.438
I WISH WE KNEW
YOU WERE COMING DOWN.

18:24.505 --> 18:25.939
WE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT WE WERE RUNNING LATE.

18:26.006 --> 18:27.708
WE JUST SIGNED
A CONTRACT WITH BATALI.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.510
HE'S TAKING OUR ENTIRE
YIELD OF SAFFRON.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.747
WOW, THAT IS REALLY
AMAZING NEWS YOU SHOULD
KEEP IN YOUR POCKET

18:33.814 --> 18:36.517
FOR THE NEXT
FIVE MINUTES. JO.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.620
UH, YOU'RE A REALLY
GREAT GUY, BUT--

18:39.686 --> 18:43.156
- THE HOSE!
- WHAT DID YOU
JUST CALL US?

18:43.223 --> 18:45.225
IS IT OKAY?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.628
IT'S RUINED.
IT'S ALL RUINED.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.230
THAT'S YOUR FAULT, SWEETIE.
YOU LET ALL THAT SOIL GET DRY.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.132
- YEAH, WE TRIED
TO HELP YOU. SEE?
- MM-HMM.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.735
YOU DID THIS?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.738
CALM IT DOWN, AMOS.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.307
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S JUST A FLOWER.

19:00.374 --> 19:02.943
YEAH, SAFFRON FLOWERS.

19:03.010 --> 19:04.678
WHAT IS SAFFRON?

19:04.745 --> 19:06.980
YEAH, I ALWAYS WONDERED THAT.
IS IT LIKE A CAPER?

19:07.047 --> 19:10.484
YEAH, LIKE CAPERS--
LIKE IS THAT A SMALL SPICE
OR LIKE A LITTLE BEAN?

19:10.551 --> 19:12.386
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT SAFFRON,

19:12.452 --> 19:14.421
THE MOST EXPENSIVE SPICE
IN THE WORLD.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.523
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO GROW IN NEW YORK.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.059
THE MOISTURE LEVEL
HAS TO BE JUST RIGHT.

19:19.126 --> 19:21.895
WE SPENT YEARS PERFECTING
THIS MICROCLIMATE,

19:21.962 --> 19:25.699
AND NOW IT'S GONE,
ALL GONE!

19:25.766 --> 19:27.734
( MOANS )

19:29.670 --> 19:32.105
WE LOVE YOU?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.473
WHAT?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.142
I MEAN, I FEEL
SORRY FOR THEM.

19:35.209 --> 19:37.144
THEY WANTED TO SHARE
THEIR BOUNTY WITH
THE WORLD.

19:37.211 --> 19:38.545
SCREW OUR BOUNTY.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.615
THIS 4X8 PLOT WAS
GONNA BE WORTH $10,000.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.150
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT MONEY.

19:43.217 --> 19:45.619
WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONEY?
IT'S AWESOME!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.222
ONCE WE HAD BATALI,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.023
EVERY CHEF IN TOWN
WAS GONNA BE COMING TO US.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.959
WE WERE GONNA BE
THE SAFFRON KINGS OF NEW YORK.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.162
WE WERE GONNA BUY
LEATHER PANTS AND
GET SO MUCH ACTION.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.667
YOU ARE NOT THE MAN
THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

20:00.734 --> 20:04.404
- I'M SORRY, STEVE.
- WE WERE THIS CLOSE, RICK.

20:04.471 --> 20:08.175
WHOA, HOLD UP NOW.
RICK AND STEVE?

20:08.242 --> 20:09.977
Y'ALL NAMES
ARE FAKE TOO?

20:10.043 --> 20:14.014
WHO'S GONNA BUY A $7 TOMATO
FROM RICK AND STEVE?

20:18.552 --> 20:20.988
GOOD THING ALL WE DID
WAS KISS THEM.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.542
FOR THE NEXT WEEK,
NOTHING COMES IN
THIS APARTMENT

20:41.608 --> 20:44.378
THAT'S GREEN UNLESS
IT'S ON A POPSICLE STICK.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.047
I AM FINALLY STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN.

20:47.114 --> 20:51.051
A LITTLE MORE HIGH FRUCTOSE
CORN SYRUP AND I'LL BE
BACK TO NORMAL.

20:51.118 --> 20:53.987
I'M JUST GLAD
WE GOT RID OF THAT COMPOST
AND FRUIT FLIES,

20:54.054 --> 20:57.024
AND I'M GLAD WE GOT RID
OF THAT GOAT.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.026
YEAH, THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF THAT.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.328
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
RETURN THE GOAT.

21:01.395 --> 21:03.130
I THOUGHT YOU
RETURNED THE GOAT.

21:03.197 --> 21:05.465
- WHO WANTS SOME STEW?
- ( GEORGIA GASPS )

21:05.532 --> 21:07.401
AUNT HONEY, NO.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.403
HE WAS JUST
AN INNOCENT GOAT.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.005
WHAT?
IT'S VEGETABLE STEW.

21:12.072 --> 21:15.275
LEFTOVERS FROM MY DINNER 
WITH THE RODHAM CLINTONS.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.778
YOU KNOW,
I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT HIM.

21:17.845 --> 21:19.780
THEY LOOKED HAPPIER
THAN EVER.

21:19.847 --> 21:23.116
THAT'S GOOD.
AUNT HONEY, DID YOU
GET RID OF THE GOAT?

21:23.183 --> 21:24.985
NOW WHY WOULD I GET RID
OF THE GOAT?

21:25.052 --> 21:27.321
KEEPS MY LLAMA CALM.

21:30.257 --> 21:32.259
