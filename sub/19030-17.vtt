WEBVTT

00:04.571 --> 00:06.505
The park was such a blast.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.632
But I had no idea
he was so scared of puppies.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.506
Oh, he usually loves them.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.238
Oh, I wasn't talking about Sam.

00:13.313 --> 00:16.077
That was not a puppy.
It was a full-grown Dachshund,

00:16.116 --> 00:18.482
and it came at me like a rabid missile!

00:18.518 --> 00:21.146
I heard when you're being attacked
by a tiny gay dog,

00:21.187 --> 00:24.645
you're supposed to pull its sweater
over its head and hockey-fight it.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.022
Hmm.

00:26.059 --> 00:29.085
Sam was so happy this morning,
I decided I'm definitely moving here.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.927
You know, it's only 37 minutes
from work, and it just...

00:31.965 --> 00:34.900
It makes it so much easier for me
to see more of him, you know?

00:34.934 --> 00:37.095
I think that's great, J.D.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.729
<i>J.D.: This feels right.</i>

00:38.772 --> 00:40.831
<i>Still, sometimes</i>
<i>when you make big decisions,</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:44.537
<i>life starts going so fast that it seems</i>
<i>like you're not even moving through it.</i>

00:44.577 --> 00:46.704
<i>It just happens to you.</i>

00:46.746 --> 00:49.237
<i>Like that, I found a new place,</i>

00:50.316 --> 00:51.806
<i>furnished it,</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:57.986
<i>and after work, I got in my car</i>

00:58.024 --> 01:01.289
<i>and made the 37-minute drive</i>
<i>to my new home.</i>

01:02.762 --> 01:06.755
Hey, baby, check out my new badge.
Christopher Turk, Chief of Surgery.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.268
I am so proud of you!

01:11.771 --> 01:13.500
- No.
- Yes.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.633
Guys, check out
the on-call room walk of shame.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.873
What were you two doing in there?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.107
- Nothing. I was taking a nap.
- Nothing at all.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.479
- I don't know what he was doing.
- Just preparing for the day, really.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.110
Derek, you can't do that
before a full day of surgery.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.883
Booty weakens the core muscles.
You know, these get sore.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.720
Think I'm pretty good.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.686
Let's go get you some coffee.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.929
Nice pull, Denise.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.162
That kid is so fine, he's actually made

01:41.201 --> 01:43.396
a couple of guest appearances
up in here.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.494
Me, too.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.700
I've got this one scenario where
he and I are walking down a dark alley

01:47.740 --> 01:49.901
and J.D. Is a mugger
who jumps out with a knife.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.967
Derek used to be the mugger,

01:51.010 --> 01:53.205
but then I thought that
was a little racially insensitive.

01:53.246 --> 01:56.113
Anyway, there's a scuffle.
I wind up with the knife,

01:56.149 --> 01:58.549
so at first I force them both
to pleasure me,

01:58.585 --> 02:01.986
but then it takes a left turn,
and I go on a killing spree.

02:02.021 --> 02:05.684
I know it's a little weird, but we all have
our little tricks to help us climax, right?

02:05.725 --> 02:08.387
Elliot Reid. Two years therapy-free.

02:08.428 --> 02:09.952
I don't need it anymore.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.691
I don't know
why I keep jumping into bed with him.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.165
My confidence is shot from screwing up
that spinal tap last week,

02:14.200 --> 02:17.328
and then yesterday,
I misdiagnosed an ectopic pregnancy.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.736
I don't know. Maybe I wanted to do
something I knew I could do right,

02:19.772 --> 02:23.173
like banging a dude. I'm a giant ho-bag.

02:23.209 --> 02:27.669
No. No, you are not.
So is Derek a good guy?

02:27.714 --> 02:29.443
Derek? I thought it was Eric.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.080
Hey, you coming up
to the third floor today?

02:33.119 --> 02:36.111
No. I'm not cleaning the third floor
this month.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.386
I'm sending a message.
You steal a man's sandwich off his cart,

02:38.424 --> 02:40.119
you stew in your own filth.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.991
Sweetie, I took that sandwich.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.496
Well, I can't change my mind now.
I'll look like a flip-flopper.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.500
Listen, my sister Amy's son
is having a tough time at school,

02:47.534 --> 02:49.024
and since his dad is out of the picture,

02:49.068 --> 02:51.059
I thought maybe you could sit down
and talk to him.

02:51.104 --> 02:54.369
Amy, who gave us a doily
for our wedding,

02:54.407 --> 02:55.999
wants me to save her boy?

02:56.042 --> 02:57.475
Please?

02:57.510 --> 02:58.602
That seems fair.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.770
- So, lan...
- It's Ethan.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.577
Whatever. Your mom says
you're having a rough time in school.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.016
Liam stole my backpack.
I wanna hit him.

03:06.052 --> 03:07.917
No, no, we don't hit. Never.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.945
You hit somebody
and the anger's gone,

03:09.989 --> 03:11.354
and it's all over.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.292
No, the goal should be
to keep that anger inside you,

03:14.327 --> 03:17.125
growing like an anger baby.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.955
You got to
get inside Liam's head, right?

03:19.999 --> 03:21.967
You got to find out Liam's weaknesses.

03:22.001 --> 03:26.267
Like, is he afraid of the dark?
Does he have any food allergies?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.741
How does he do
if he's left out on open water?

03:28.775 --> 03:32.040
Does he have a pet? Could that pet
be convinced to betray him?

03:32.078 --> 03:33.443
Would you be willing
to get plastic surgery

03:33.479 --> 03:34.503
to further your goals?

03:34.547 --> 03:38.347
Would you change
the location of your eyes to here?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.414
That's the level of commitment
I'm looking for.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.445
Or maybe I'm just wasting my time.

03:43.489 --> 03:44.979
Are you on drugs?

03:45.024 --> 03:46.286
Are you?

03:47.026 --> 03:49.824
<i>J.D.: Now that I lived here, when Kim</i>
<i>and I had to make a Sam exchange,</i>

03:49.862 --> 03:52.023
<i>I just zipped over to St. Vincent's.</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:55.228
Hey, J.D., since you're coming around
my hospital a lot more often now,

03:55.268 --> 03:57.930
I was hoping maybe
you could dress a little nicer,

03:57.971 --> 04:01.407
and maybe say "smell you later"
a little less often,

04:01.441 --> 04:02.669
or just stop completely.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.768
- Are you sure? It's hilarious.
- It's not.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.812
Hey, calm down, gramps!

04:07.847 --> 04:10.077
And now you're screaming
at my chief of medicine.

04:10.116 --> 04:11.845
Sorry, Dr. Mantoots.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.211
Don't laugh.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.451
- His name is Mantoots?
- Yes. Stop laughing.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.626
Tell them.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.653
<i>J.D.: This was gonna be hard.</i>

04:25.832 --> 04:28.062
I got a job at St. Vincent's.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.065
I'm leaving Sacred Heart
at the end of the month.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.095
What? How?

04:33.139 --> 04:37.098
Well, I was apologizing to Kim's
chief of medicine, Dr. Mantoots...

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:48.254 --> 04:50.154
Mantoots.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.419
Anyway, Mantoots and I
ended up hitting it off

04:52.458 --> 04:55.621
and he actually offered me
their residency-director job.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.789
It pays a little bit more money,

04:57.830 --> 05:02.199
and I'm really liking
being closer to Sam, so I took it.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.530
<i>J.D.: As I scanned across their faces,</i>

05:04.570 --> 05:08.165
<i>it felt amazing to see</i>
<i>how everyone truly felt about me.</i>

05:11.711 --> 05:12.769
Why are you stretching?

05:12.812 --> 05:16.179
Because, Barbie, I'm just so very happy

05:16.215 --> 05:20.652
that I'm gonna try something
I haven't done since high school.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.177
Back flip!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.882
- Oh.
- Oh, oh.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.654
- Did I stick it, you guys?
- No.

05:27.694 --> 05:28.752
- You're crazy.
- Not really.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.023
No, you did not.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.553
It was worth it.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.032
<i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

05:36.102 --> 05:37.763
<i>No, I know</i>

05:37.804 --> 05:39.635
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

05:42.909 --> 05:44.672
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

05:47.480 --> 05:48.606
So with the new job,

05:48.648 --> 05:51.276
do you think you'll be able
to keep the romance going?

05:51.317 --> 05:52.841
I don't think it should be that hard.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.352
I was talking to them.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.322
Hilarious.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.623
You mean to tell me you're interested
in Newbie that way, too?

06:01.661 --> 06:03.891
Seriously, are you two gonna be okay?

06:03.930 --> 06:07.696
I mean, you lived together in college,
in med school, out here.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.793
I mean, you guys are inseparable.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.133
It's not a big deal.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.637
Sure, it's gonna suck
not working together,

06:12.672 --> 06:15.402
but we'll see each other all the time.
We're only 37 minutes away.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.671
Thirty-five if I don't stop
at the blueberry stand.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.473
Yeah, but if I'm with you,
we're stopping for blueberries.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.877
- Hell, yeah, we are.
- Okay.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.108
I'm just saying, the only time
you two haven't been together

06:23.149 --> 06:24.912
was our honeymoon.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.279
What?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.787
- It's time.
- No.

06:28.821 --> 06:29.981
Yes.

06:30.289 --> 06:31.813
Fine. Honey, um,

06:32.458 --> 06:35.427
J.D. And I were together
during our honeymoon.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.725
He flew in and stayed in the bungalow
by the pool.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.392
He forgot his favorite lotion.
Am I supposed to let him get ashy?

06:40.433 --> 06:42.094
We only hung out together
when you were sleeping

06:42.135 --> 06:43.727
or when I said
I was going to get a massage.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.738
Well, sometimes you were.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.165
Smell you later.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.300
That is hilarious!

06:52.345 --> 06:54.472
I know.
You know some people don't think so?

06:54.514 --> 06:55.538
Hmm.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.151
So how's Mrs. Gallin doing
after her surgery?

07:00.186 --> 07:03.781
Incision's clean, she's afebrile,
and her vital signs are stable.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.724
Time to put on
my cheery patient face. Hi.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.125
Hi.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.289
Hi. There it is.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.455
Hi. I'm Dr. Reid.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.592
Hello.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.931
I've never actually had a chance
to work with you before.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.404
Are you enjoying it here?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.702
God, no. Are you?

07:21.741 --> 07:25.040
Not ever. I like you. I like her.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.409
Something's wrong here.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.515
So anyway, I start at St. Vincent's
at the end of the month.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.884
What are you doing with Vincent?
I wasn't listening.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.389
- Never mind.
- Vincent's my hairdresser.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.652
Well, it's good to be near your son.

07:39.692 --> 07:42.525
I still toy with the idea of
moving up to Seattle

07:42.562 --> 07:45.463
to be closer to Harrison's bordello.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.434
Harrison has dropped all pretense.
He's a man-whore now.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.802
Oh, there's good money in that,
especially if you do the naughty stuff.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.330
- Give my love to Vincent.
- Oh, I will.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.109
- Hey, weirdo.
- Yeah?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.704
You must be excited
that your little nemesis is going.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.738
No, I'm not.
I finally have my life in order.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.717
I've got my wife, I've got my Brain Trust,

08:05.751 --> 08:07.412
and I finally tricked Johann
in the gift shop

08:07.453 --> 08:09.353
into accepting my new fake currency.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.652
Then Dorian comes along
and upsets the status quo.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.819
I will bet you five bendels
that other people follow suit.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.954
Change begets change
begets change.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.590
- You just gave me a great idea.
- Hit me.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.066
From now on,
any time someone's really boring me,

08:22.101 --> 08:24.399
- I'm just gonna get up and leave.
- I don't like it.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.302
Well, Jordan, I think...

08:27.139 --> 08:28.504
Well played.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.676
I think she's bleeding internally.
You two, stay with the patient.

08:33.712 --> 08:36.648
Barbie and I are going to figure out
what the hell happened.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.743
Derek, I need you to do a head-to-toe
CT scan on Mrs. Gallin, stat.

08:40.785 --> 08:41.844
I'm on it.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.722
Stat? You don't talk like that.
Is that a new Chief of Surgery word?

08:45.758 --> 08:47.919
- J.D., stop it.
- Should I stop it, stat?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.757
- Seriously.
- Seriously, stat?

08:49.795 --> 08:51.490
- J.D.
- Everything is stat.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.021
- Stat, stat, stat. Stat.
- You done?

08:53.065 --> 08:54.657
I'm done. Stat.

08:56.002 --> 09:00.166
Your young Denise gave Mrs. Gallin
a full post-op dose of heparin.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.107
That's why she's bleeding.
Time to play "Crush the Intern."

09:03.142 --> 09:04.666
Let's give Denise a break on this one.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.201
She's having a bit of
a self-confidence crisis.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.113
Oh, will you do me a personal favor
and cover my patients?

09:10.149 --> 09:12.174
Because I'm gonna go bake her
some cookies.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.015
Just let me handle Denise, okay?

09:14.053 --> 09:17.284
Think of all the time you'll have to go
be a jackass to other people.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.518
Fair enough,
but she doesn't get to skate.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.617
A mistake was made.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.128
Someone has to go face the patient
and take the blame.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.322
Fine.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.160
Okay, since we're both
going the same way,

09:28.200 --> 09:29.462
would you mind dropping back
a few steps

09:29.502 --> 09:30.696
so we don't have to walk together?

09:30.736 --> 09:31.964
Glad to.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.003
Thanks for having us over
for dinner last night.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.102
Oh, hey, next time you guys
do a couples thing, I'll tag in.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.442
Are you seeing someone, Todd?

09:40.479 --> 09:43.539
Actually, I'm getting pretty serious
with the Hendersons.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.949
Oh, good. They're nice.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.616
Yeah, they are.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.681
We should go, Gooch.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.091
The men have
their Brain Club meeting.

09:55.127 --> 09:58.528
Brain Trust, hon. Trust.
Told her 20 times.

09:59.966 --> 10:00.990
Whatever.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.566
Let's call this meeting to order.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.935
Since I didn't like the way
that Doug said "here"

10:05.972 --> 10:07.303
during roll-call yesterday,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.935
he has been replaced by Jimmy,
the overly touchy orderly.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.980
Can I make a motion that we have to
keep our hands to ourselves?

10:16.015 --> 10:19.473
All in favor of hands to yourself?
All opposed?

10:20.186 --> 10:22.450
And since we all know that these votes
are largely ceremonial,

10:22.488 --> 10:25.252
the motion passes.
Jimmy, hands to yourself.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.652
Okay, any announcements?

10:29.695 --> 10:33.187
Uh, the Gooch and I
are having a great time,

10:33.232 --> 10:37.498
and I know it's quick,
but we're moving in together.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.231
The answer's no.

10:39.271 --> 10:41.262
That wasn't really a question.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.104
I feel like my hands are gonna explode.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.167
Motion to help out a friend?

10:45.745 --> 10:46.803
Oh.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.973
No. Jimmy, use the table.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.280
- It's firm.
- It's a table.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.218
You can't make a life decision
like this, okay?

10:54.253 --> 10:56.881
It hasn't even gone
through subcommittee.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.584
Look, Ted...
Personal sidebar.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.126
Look, Ted,
Stephanie is great,

11:05.164 --> 11:09.225
and I know the idea of change
is very exciting for some people,

11:09.268 --> 11:12.567
but just slow it down.
No moving in together, okay?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.436
- All right.
- Okay.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.875
Should we end
the personal sidebar?

11:19.679 --> 11:23.547
You know, sometimes you think,
"I'm kind of a strange dude,"

11:23.582 --> 11:26.176
and then you come across
something like this.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.855
I think we should open her up
and locate the bleeding.

11:31.891 --> 11:32.915
Typical surgeon.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.825
I think we should reverse
the anti-coagulates and monitor her.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.294
Well, as Chief, I think it's very...

11:37.329 --> 11:40.298
Did you just start a sentence
with "as Chief"?

11:40.332 --> 11:41.731
Dude, don't do that with me.

11:41.767 --> 11:45.635
As Chief, I can start anything
with "as Chief." Check it.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.504
As Chief,
I'm way more handsome than you.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.769
Actually, that's not a perfect example,

11:49.809 --> 11:53.404
because it was true before I was Chief,
so as Chief, I'm sorry.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.038
You know what?
The decision does not need to be made

11:55.081 --> 11:57.777
until tomorrow morning,
so can we agree to talk about it then?

11:57.817 --> 11:59.284
- Fine.
- Okay.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.287
Besides, didn't Carla say
you could come see my new place?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.913
Dude, you said this place
was 37 minutes away.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.288
We've been driving for an hour.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.657
What do you want? There was traffic.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.254
Hey, how do you think Farmer Hewitt

12:11.297 --> 12:12.787
gets these blueberries
to taste so sweet?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.027
I don't know. He says he uses
a special manure

12:15.067 --> 12:17.160
that his son helps him make.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.795
I didn't really wanna know more.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.107
<i>J.D.: They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

12:24.143 --> 12:26.134
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>it's only a matter of time</i>

12:26.178 --> 12:28.908
<i>before the smile gets wiped off</i>
<i>your face.</i>

12:29.949 --> 12:33.009
<i>Sometimes because the wrong person</i>
<i>is taking the blame.</i>

12:33.052 --> 12:35.543
Mrs. Gallin,
it's my fault that this happened,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.283
and I'm very sorry.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.791
It's okay.

12:40.526 --> 12:41.720
Okay.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.554
<i>Sometimes because</i>
<i>your friend ignored you.</i>

12:44.597 --> 12:47.498
Oh, my God!
I can't believe we're moving in together.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.057
Believe it, Gooch.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.506
<i>Still, not even the three hours</i>
<i>I spent last night vomiting blueberries</i>

12:54.540 --> 12:56.064
<i>could take my smile away.</i>

12:58.077 --> 12:59.772
Where's Mrs. Gallin?

12:59.812 --> 13:01.177
In surgery.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.909
What the hell?
I thought we agreed to talk about it.

13:03.949 --> 13:08.648
We did, but then I made the call.
You know, as Chief.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.761
When I walk by in a huff,
you better look.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.168
- I ain't looking!
- You will look at my huff walk!

13:25.204 --> 13:26.330
No!

13:26.372 --> 13:28.169
<i>I am happy, you are happy</i>

13:28.207 --> 13:30.573
<i>Let us be happy together</i>

13:30.609 --> 13:32.440
<i>Whether the weather is rainy or sunny</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:36.175
I said the other blonde stick
had to take the blame for Mrs. Gallin.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.776
No, you said someone had to.
Someone did.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.186
And Mrs. Gallin accepted my apology,
so we are coolio.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.190
<i>I am smiling, you are smiling</i>

13:46.225 --> 13:48.557
<i>Let us smile together</i>

13:48.594 --> 13:50.994
<i>Whether the weather is</i>
<i>cloudy or stormy</i>

13:51.030 --> 13:52.861
Oh, man, is that your betrayal stare?

13:52.898 --> 13:53.990
<i>I am happy, you are happy</i>

13:54.033 --> 13:55.193
Let it burn.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.065
<i>Let us be happy together</i>

13:57.102 --> 13:58.262
Oh, it's burning.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.896
<i>I'll be right by your side in the morning</i>

13:59.939 --> 14:02.339
<i>I'll make you breakfast in the morning</i>

14:02.374 --> 14:04.342
<i>I hope that you like cereal</i>

14:05.311 --> 14:07.074
You know, you're making this difficult.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.415
Seriously?

14:10.449 --> 14:12.440
It says I'm ready for anything.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.245
Look, I don't know if it's
the pregnancy hormones or whatever,

14:15.287 --> 14:17.118
but I need you right now.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.418
Need me for what?

14:18.457 --> 14:19.924
Need you, need you.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.391
Whoa, whoa, yeah, okay.
Yeah, that'll work.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.629
Lose the pants.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.832
Done.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.728
Occupied.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.672
No. This was the plan.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.268
- You need to talk.
- Oh, man!

14:38.310 --> 14:39.834
Why did you tell me
to take my pants off, then?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.006
Sorry, I got caught up in it.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.006
You got caught up in it, too, right?

14:44.049 --> 14:47.382
Oh, you need me to say yes, don't you?
I got so caught up in it.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.047
- I know. I know you did.
- Now talk.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.194
- Man, put your pants back on.
- I'm not ready yet.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.926
- It happens to everybody.
- Hey.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.366
Did Dr. Reid get a chance to talk to you
about Mrs. Gallin?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.562
Yeah. She explained my mistake,

15:04.603 --> 15:06.070
and she told me
it was a pretty common one.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.572
Did she also get a chance to tell you

15:07.606 --> 15:09.733
that we're passing out
the World's Worst Doctor Awards,

15:09.775 --> 15:11.367
and that you're a finalist?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.275
You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.041
Thanks. Your tiny surgeon brain

15:15.080 --> 15:17.139
may now go back to
its regularly scheduled programming.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.774
Uh, duh.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.749
He's not gonna stop until you go.

15:22.521 --> 15:23.920
Ah.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.281
Look, I know I messed up.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.054
Dr. Reid just told me
not to sweat it too much,

15:28.093 --> 15:29.720
since I'm so hard on myself.

15:29.762 --> 15:34.062
Seeing as you almost killed someone,
if you do feel the urge to "sweat it,"

15:34.099 --> 15:37.398
you go ahead and jump on that.
You damn sure earned it.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.070
I just bought this yogurt,
and for change,

15:42.107 --> 15:44.905
they gave me this thing that said
"three bendels" on it.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.138
That's worth about 40 cents.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.405
Hey, sweat stain,

15:48.447 --> 15:51.245
how's it going with your girlfriend
now that you guys are roomies?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.751
We're having sex, like, all the time.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.344
- Oh, God.
- Why?

15:55.387 --> 15:59.050
Why do people react like that
when they picture me having sex?

15:59.091 --> 16:00.820
You try it.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.349
Oh, God!

16:02.394 --> 16:04.328
Not a pretty sight, is it?

16:05.264 --> 16:07.061
Still, Ted made me think.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.192
I mean, maybe J.D. And I
should just go for it

16:09.234 --> 16:11.099
and move in together, you know?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.036
And change begets more change.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.562
I've been missing
being a doctor so much,

16:14.606 --> 16:17.268
I've been thinking
about working locum tenens.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.539
You know,
temporary family practice stuff.

16:19.578 --> 16:20.636
More change.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.374
You're going back to work?

16:22.414 --> 16:25.440
With a second baby,
I don't think I can be a nurse full-time.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.678
More change.

16:26.719 --> 16:30.951
Do you think it would drive Perry crazy
if I adopted a couple of Asian kids?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.618
Okay, that's it. Nobody move.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.956
Excuse me.

16:35.761 --> 16:36.921
Okay, yes, she can move,

16:36.962 --> 16:38.930
but that's 'cause
she asked permission earlier.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.022
When?

16:40.065 --> 16:41.430
It was before you all got here.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.435
She... I said, "I might say,
'Nobody move,'

16:43.469 --> 16:45.835
"and if so you better not move."
And she said, "Yeah, but I gotta move.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.031
"Just over there. I'm still listening."

16:47.072 --> 16:48.437
And I said, "That's cool,
'cause we're good friends.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.941
"I'll see you later."
She said, "Yeah, definitely.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.840
- "Let's do something fun."
- What do you want?

16:51.877 --> 16:54.675
I want you to stop changing
your lives, okay?

16:54.713 --> 16:56.908
We've been conditioned to think
that change is good and exciting.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.576
Well, what if it's not?
What if it's actually bad

16:58.617 --> 17:01.279
and very, very dangerous
in a way that I don't...

17:01.320 --> 17:03.618
Hey, nobody move! Nobody...

17:04.890 --> 17:07.085
Yeah, you can move.
No one cares about you.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.424
Honey, how would you feel
about my sister and her son

17:09.461 --> 17:11.452
living with us for a while?

17:11.497 --> 17:12.896
Outstanding.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.598
- Why are we fighting?
- I don't know.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.105
I can't believe you're leaving.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.266
I know.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.898
I'm the new Chief of Surgery,
you know?

17:23.942 --> 17:25.704
And you're Dr. Cox's number-two guy.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.212
I thought, eventually,
we'd be running this place together.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.215
<i>J.D.: How cool would that be?</i>

17:34.486 --> 17:37.353
I love how you two have kept
everything in the hospital the same.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.823
You know, except for the free pudding.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.728
Sorry, baby,
but the free pudding's for us.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.760
Turk, you made a mess. Let him out!

17:58.610 --> 18:00.475
Janitor eat?

18:00.512 --> 18:04.175
Janitor clean. Janitor only clean.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.215
- Eat?
- No.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.744
- Clean?
- No!

18:11.957 --> 18:13.618
- Pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.820
- What is your problem?
- I'm glad you asked,

18:17.863 --> 18:19.797
because it seems like
no matter where I go in this dump,

18:19.832 --> 18:22.426
this unbelievably annoying doctor,
Elliot somebody,

18:22.468 --> 18:25.835
keeps coming up to me
and talking to me... Oh.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.901
Why would you torch Denise?
You know her confidence is shot.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.568
Plus, the other day,
you even said you liked her,

18:30.609 --> 18:32.474
and I know that
you're just kidding around,

18:32.511 --> 18:35.173
but you never said you liked me,
even as a joke.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.511
- I like you.
- Really?

18:36.548 --> 18:37.708
- No.
- Nicely done.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.239
Thank you.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.946
You know what I don't get?
You've always protected the interns.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.012
I mean, you've always been
their teacher first.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.183
And why in God's name
should I waste my time and energy

18:46.225 --> 18:48.523
whipping some intern into shape
when I know damn sure that

18:48.560 --> 18:50.027
as soon as he gets the first opportunity,

18:50.062 --> 18:52.030
he's just gonna blow
right out of this dump?

18:52.064 --> 18:54.396
Oh. "He." Oh, okay. Now I get it.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.263
Why don't you just tell him that
you're sad that he's leaving,

18:57.302 --> 18:59.133
like a normal human being?

18:59.171 --> 19:00.433
What are you talking about?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.939
Come on, Perry.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.874
We both know
who you're really mad at.

19:05.377 --> 19:08.403
So I'll work somewhere else.
We'll still hang.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.815
J.D., that's not a 37-minute drive.

19:11.850 --> 19:15.149
It's an hour-and-15-minute drive,
round trip,

19:15.187 --> 19:20.557
and I got a wife, I got a kid,
I got a kid on the way, I got a new job.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.219
I'm in the same boat.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.592
It's a good boat to be in, though, right?

19:24.630 --> 19:25.790
Yeah.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.856
So we'll see each other when we can.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.860
How about tonight? We'll act sulky
so the girls think we need to talk more.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.167
I'm in.

19:35.374 --> 19:38.036
I'm gonna miss your skinny white butt.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.607
I'm gonna miss your perfect brown one.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.273
You wanna pull your pants up first?

19:45.317 --> 19:46.978
I'm still not ready.

19:47.653 --> 19:52.454
<i>This is my winter song to you</i>

19:52.491 --> 19:53.583
Guys,
you know the rules.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.991
If you're gonna hook up in here,
put a sock on the door.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.053
Come on. I know a secret place.

20:00.799 --> 20:04.064
<i>J.D.: Remember when you were a kid</i>
<i>and your family moved,</i>

20:04.102 --> 20:07.697
<i>and how you always wanted someone</i>
<i>to blame for all those big changes?</i>

20:07.739 --> 20:09.673
You're still working here
for a few more weeks, right?

20:09.708 --> 20:10.834
Yep.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.707
I'm gonna make them special!

20:14.079 --> 20:15.944
<i>J.D.: Luckily, most of us</i>
<i>find the courage</i>

20:15.981 --> 20:18.142
<i>to tell friends that we'll miss them.</i>

20:18.183 --> 20:20.014
Good night, Dr. Cox.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.646
<i>I still believe in summer days</i>

20:22.688 --> 20:24.019
<i>J.D.: Or not.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:26.957
<i>The seasons always change</i>

20:29.194 --> 20:30.252
Hello?

20:30.295 --> 20:33.696
<i>Still, what I remember most is that</i>
<i>leaving parts of my life behind</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:35.962
<i>always ended up hurting</i>
<i>more than I thought.</i>

20:36.001 --> 20:38.401
No, Turk, don't sweat it, man.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.735
If Izzy's alone, you can't leave her.

20:40.772 --> 20:44.367
I'm pretty sure that's illegal. Yeah.

20:44.409 --> 20:48.937
We'll just hang out another time.
All right, man. Bye.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.607
He can't make it?

20:52.651 --> 20:53.811
No.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.544
<i>Is love alive?</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:59.486
<i>Is love alive?</i>

20:59.891 --> 21:01.882
<i>Is love alive?</i>

21:03.729 --> 21:06.129
<i>I am happy, you are happy</i>

21:06.164 --> 21:08.462
<i>Let us be happy together</i>

21:08.500 --> 21:10.730
<i>Whether the weather is rainy or sunny</i>

21:10.769 --> 21:13.101
<i>I will always be</i>
<i>your funny honey bunny</i>

21:13.138 --> 21:15.368
<i>I am lucky, you are lucky</i>

21:15.407 --> 21:17.602
<i>Let us get lucky together</i>

21:17.643 --> 21:19.804
<i>Whether the weather</i>
<i>is cloudy or breezy</i>

21:19.845 --> 21:21.039
Ukulele makes me horny.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.410
<i>I'll be there to say</i>

21:22.447 --> 21:23.505
<i>Hey, come on, let's take it easy</i>

21:23.548 --> 21:25.880
<i>And isn't it nice to say I love you?</i>

21:26.305 --> 21:32.201
