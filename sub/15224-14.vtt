01:19.901 --> 01:22.934
Who did you bet on
in the fourth race?

01:22.968 --> 01:23.934
That stiff...

01:23.968 --> 01:26.000
Hey, where have you guys been?

01:26.033 --> 01:27.701
Aw, you don't want
to know, Elaine.

01:27.734 --> 01:29.534
This is kind of
a sore point with you,

01:29.567 --> 01:31.200
and I think
the less said about it

01:31.234 --> 01:32.534
in front of you,
the better.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.801
Last time we went to
the track, you went nuts.

01:34.834 --> 01:35.801
I told her.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.267
Maybe she missed it.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.968
You mean that you guys
cannot think

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
of a better way
to throw away your money?

01:41.033 --> 01:42.501
Nope. She got it.

01:42.534 --> 01:43.667
Not everybody lost.

01:43.701 --> 01:45.100
Latka won a few races.

01:45.133 --> 01:46.434
He's got a system.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.434
Oh, yeah?

01:47.467 --> 01:48.934
Latka, what's your system?

01:48.968 --> 01:54.400
Oh, uh, uh, my system
is based on the temperature.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.167
You mean the temperature
of the air

01:56.200 --> 01:58.100
has something to do
with how you bet?

01:58.133 --> 02:01.434
Oh, no, no--
the temperature of the horse.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.267
And you actually won money?

02:03.300 --> 02:05.267
Yes. I won $12.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.767
Uh-huh. How much did you lose?

02:06.801 --> 02:08.133
$36.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.234
I did that well
without a system.

02:11.267 --> 02:14.133
Yeah, but can you
do it every time?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.767
Guys, this
gambling thing
has got to stop.

02:16.801 --> 02:18.267
Don't lecture, Nardo.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.601
I suppose you don't have
any vices of your own.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.033
Sure, I have vices.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.434
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.267
Okay, forget it,
forget it.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.868
I'm not going
to let this thing
upset me, all right?

02:30.901 --> 02:34.434
Hey, I want to thank you
guys for taking me along.

02:34.467 --> 02:36.434
You mean you took Jim with you?!

02:36.467 --> 02:39.033
This man is just getting
his head beneath water,

02:39.067 --> 02:42.100
and you have to go
and turn him on to
something gambling?

02:42.133 --> 02:43.434
Nardo, would you...?

02:43.467 --> 02:44.434
Forget it.

02:44.467 --> 02:45.934
Okay, okay, okay.

02:45.968 --> 02:49.100
I wish I'd started gambling
a long time ago.

02:49.133 --> 02:53.067
I've been looking for something
to take the place in my life

02:53.100 --> 02:55.567
of, uh, uh, what do you call it?

02:55.601 --> 02:56.734
Uh... drugs?

02:56.767 --> 02:59.234
No, thanks.

03:01.234 --> 03:04.167
Well, what I mean is,
I never...

03:04.200 --> 03:07.834
I never got into
the real kick of betting.

03:07.868 --> 03:11.200
It makes life
so much more interesting.

03:11.234 --> 03:15.267
Right now, that guy's
over there getting
something to drink.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.467
Ordinarily, that wouldn't
mean a thing to me

03:17.501 --> 03:20.801
but, if I were to bet
on what drink he'd choose,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.133
the next few seconds
would be thrilling.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.801
I got a buck that
says it's coffee.

03:25.834 --> 03:28.534
Hey, hey, hey, Bob.

03:28.567 --> 03:29.701
Vodka gimlet.

03:29.734 --> 03:30.901
Jim!

03:30.934 --> 03:33.701
Jim, there's only coffee
and hot chocolate

03:33.734 --> 03:35.033
in that machine.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.701
Well, so, give me odds.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.534
BOBBY:
No, no, no.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.200
ALEX:
Give him odds.

03:40.234 --> 03:41.467
A hundred to one.

03:41.501 --> 03:42.734
I can't pass that by.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.234
Oh, for crying out loud.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.234
Hey, uh, how's the gimlet?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.300
It's coffee.

03:47.334 --> 03:48.968
I told you so, man.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.467
Thanks, Bobby.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.734
You're welcome.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.734
For giving
me that thrill.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.734
My last thrill
for a while.

03:56.767 --> 03:59.934
Hey, Jim, I didn't mean
to take your last dollar.

03:59.968 --> 04:01.934
Then give it back.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.167
Okay.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.000
Thanks.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.167
You're welcome.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.033
Pooky... Juanina...

04:11.067 --> 04:13.767
Alex, I really hope
that you're satisfied,

04:13.801 --> 04:16.767
because you just turned Jim
into a gambling junkie.

04:16.801 --> 04:18.834
Hey, come on, Elaine.
It's his money, you know?

04:18.868 --> 04:20.166
It's his business.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.367
It's his life.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.868
And it's your fault.

04:22.901 --> 04:26.100
Look, Elaine, just because
your ex-husband was a gambler...

04:26.133 --> 04:29.100
Oh... do <i>not</i> bring
my ex-husband into this.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.100
He has nothing
to do with this
whatsoever.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.434
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:32.467 --> 04:35.434
Do you know that my ex-husband
was a gambler?

04:35.467 --> 04:38.501
It was rumored
to that effect, yes. Why?

04:38.534 --> 04:40.200
Alex, I know
about gambling.

04:40.234 --> 04:42.067
I mean, I'm
worried about Jim.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.400
Excuse me.

04:43.434 --> 04:47.033
Uh, are you fighting over me?

04:47.067 --> 04:49.100
Well, perhaps we are, yeah.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.601
Well, don't worry, Elaine,

04:50.634 --> 04:55.067
because I don't have any more
money to gamble with anyhow.

04:55.100 --> 04:59.033
Oh, Ignatowski,
can I see you a second?

05:02.067 --> 05:04.033
How's it going, Pally?

05:04.067 --> 05:06.067
Oh, average.

05:08.067 --> 05:10.033
Sit down?

05:10.067 --> 05:12.067
Sure.

05:15.334 --> 05:18.334
Uh, Iggy, you want
to spin over here?

05:18.367 --> 05:21.167
Oh.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.601
Uh...

05:23.634 --> 05:24.968
By any chance,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.467
would you be interested
in borrowing a few bucks

05:28.501 --> 05:31.634
to, say, gamble
on the horses?

05:31.667 --> 05:33.000
Would you
lend that to me?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.801
Sure.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.300
You're a good risk.

05:36.334 --> 05:40.300
I know you'd work real hard
to pay me back the loan

05:40.334 --> 05:44.300
plus the interest,
which is the usual, uh, 85%.

05:44.334 --> 05:45.801
Sounds like a good deal.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.801
Is a handshake
good enough for you?

05:47.834 --> 05:48.801
Sure.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.434
Well, it ain't for me.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.901
Just, uh,
sign it right there

05:53.934 --> 05:55.734
on the dotted line.

05:55.767 --> 05:58.334
Okeydoke.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.601
Excuse me, boss.

06:01.634 --> 06:04.868
What does this say
in the little tiny letters?

06:04.901 --> 06:08.067
Oh, uh, that's just a,
you know, a formality.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.067
That says, in the event

06:10.100 --> 06:12.667
that you're unable
to pay me back,

06:12.701 --> 06:14.167
I have the right

06:14.200 --> 06:17.167
to sell your body for
medical experiments.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.667
Oh, oh.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.667
You mean after I'm dead.

06:20.701 --> 06:23.267
No.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.334
Right there.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.501
Hi, everybody.

06:45.534 --> 06:46.667
Hey, Alex.

06:46.701 --> 06:48.000
Oh, hi, Alex.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.667
Hey, have you seen Jim?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.300
No, I haven't. Why?

06:51.334 --> 06:53.801
'Cause none of us have
seen him lately, either.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.200
He's been at the track
every day this week.

06:56.234 --> 06:59.767
Am I really going to get
another anti-gambling sermon

06:59.801 --> 07:03.334
from a woman holding a handful
of little pasteboards

07:03.367 --> 07:06.834
with little pictures
of kings and queens on them?

07:06.868 --> 07:09.234
She's got kings and queens?

07:09.267 --> 07:10.567
I fold.

07:10.601 --> 07:12.734
This is a game, Alex.
There's no money involved.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.234
Oh, yeah.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.834
I'm back in.

07:15.868 --> 07:16.834
Hi, everybody.

07:16.868 --> 07:17.834
Hi, Jim.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.234
BOBBY:
Hi, Jim.

07:19.267 --> 07:20.400
How you doing?

07:20.434 --> 07:21.901
ALEX:
Jim, come here.

07:21.934 --> 07:23.200
I want to talk to you.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.501
Okeydoke.

07:25.534 --> 07:27.000
Over here, Jim.

07:27.033 --> 07:29.767
Look, Jim, I know
you've been at the track

07:29.801 --> 07:31.801
very often now--
almost every day--

07:31.834 --> 07:33.067
and maybe you're
enjoying yourself

07:33.100 --> 07:34.934
but, Jim, look, there's
another side to gambling,

07:34.968 --> 07:36.133
and I want
to tell you about it.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.801
Look, Jim, first,
you borrow from Louie.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.801
Then, when he
runs out of money,

07:39.834 --> 07:42.033
you'll have to go
to a loan shark.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.801
Fine.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.267
Fine? No, no, no.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.534
Jim, the next thing you know,

07:46.567 --> 07:48.834
you're going to get a visit
from some guy with no neck

07:48.868 --> 07:51.367
carrying a baseball bat, and
he wants his money back, Jim!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.701
I'll, uh...
give him the money.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.400
But you won't
have the money, Jim!

07:55.434 --> 07:57.400
I'll ask him
to wait a while.

07:57.434 --> 07:58.934
Yeah. He'll say,

07:58.968 --> 08:01.434
( <i>deep voice</i> ):
Ignatowski,
I waited long enough.

08:01.467 --> 08:04.501
Well, um, I need
a little time.

08:04.534 --> 08:06.467
Ignatowski,
you got two choices:

08:06.501 --> 08:08.467
You either pay me
the money now,

08:08.501 --> 08:10.467
or you pay me the money now.

08:10.501 --> 08:14.400
Yeah, he pulls that,
and I'll call the cops.

08:14.434 --> 08:18.234
Jim, what are the police
going to do for you?

08:18.267 --> 08:20.100
They'll protect me.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.133
I'll tell them there's a man
trying to kill me.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.334
( <i>nasal voice</i> ):
Oh, yeah? Ignatowski?
You say your name is Ignatowski?

08:25.367 --> 08:27.868
Oh, that name rings a bell.
Are you the same Ignatowski

08:27.901 --> 08:29.501
who was smoking
an illegal substance

08:29.534 --> 08:31.100
on the 24th of May, 1968,

08:31.133 --> 08:33.234
and then you ran
six red lights...

08:33.267 --> 08:34.701
Five! Five lights!

08:36.100 --> 08:37.567
Huh?

08:37.601 --> 08:38.933
Huh?

08:38.967 --> 08:40.933
I got to
get out of town.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.933
I'll hide
in my folks' house.

08:42.967 --> 08:47.667
( <i>accent</i> ):
Jim, Jim, it's so good
to have you back home.

08:47.701 --> 08:48.667
My son.

08:48.701 --> 08:50.100
There were
some strange men

08:50.133 --> 08:53.501
came here today,
say you owe
them some money.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.300
They took
away your mama.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.467
Mom!

08:56.501 --> 08:59.534
So, now, what are
you going to do, Jim?

08:59.567 --> 09:01.434
I'll go see a priest!

09:01.467 --> 09:03.367
I don't do priests.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.801
You got to.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.300
It's my only hope.

09:06.334 --> 09:08.501
Look, Jim, you've got
to control yourself.

09:08.534 --> 09:11.434
You got to get
some kind of control
about this gambling.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.400
You're right. I quit.
I quit forever.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.667
Good, Jim.
You're going to quit,

09:14.701 --> 09:16.634
and you're going
to pay back all of your losses.

09:16.667 --> 09:17.767
What losses?

09:17.801 --> 09:20.033
All the money that
you lost gambling.

09:20.067 --> 09:22.834
I haven't lost money
gambling. I won $10,000.

09:22.868 --> 09:24.467
You won $10,000?

09:24.501 --> 09:26.467
You see that? He won.

09:26.501 --> 09:29.801
Jim, just don't forget
who got you started.

09:29.834 --> 09:34.133
I bet $35 on a
300-to-one long shot

09:34.167 --> 09:36.701
named "On Dasher."

09:36.734 --> 09:39.701
BOBBY:
You bet on a
300-to-one shot?

09:39.734 --> 09:42.267
Yeah, well, I identify
with the long shots.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.767
Here you are, Louie--

09:43.801 --> 09:46.601
every penny of your money,
plus interest,

09:46.634 --> 09:49.467
plus a couple of bucks
for your troubles.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.367
You see that?

09:52.400 --> 09:54.701
All your complaining,
all your lecturing--

09:54.734 --> 09:57.167
the guy walks in here
richer than all of us.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.501
He can now change his life
if he wants to.

09:59.534 --> 10:02.734
So what are you going
to do with the rest
of the money, Jim?

10:02.767 --> 10:04.067
Nothing. I've
already spent it.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.400
What?!
What?!

10:05.434 --> 10:06.567
What were you saying?

10:06.601 --> 10:08.334
He spent all his...?
You spent all
your money?

10:08.367 --> 10:10.934
You spent the rest
of all that money?!

10:10.968 --> 10:13.968
How many bars
are between
the track and here?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.801
Uh, 84... but I didn't
go into any of them.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.033
How could you win $10,000
on a horse race,

10:20.067 --> 10:21.801
and then blow
it all immediately?

10:21.834 --> 10:24.901
What did you spend
the money on, Jim?

10:24.934 --> 10:27.567
Ignatowski!

10:27.601 --> 10:29.467
Yo?

10:31.467 --> 10:33.734
Thanks.

10:33.767 --> 10:37.701
They, uh,
threw in the saddle.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.701
He bought
a racehorse.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.167
I know he bought
a racehorse.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.334
I can see a racehorse.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.534
He bought a racehorse!

10:43.567 --> 10:46.033
He <i>used</i> to be a racehorse.

10:46.067 --> 10:49.534
But, after the race,
I took one look at him--

10:49.567 --> 10:53.400
all sweaty and foamy
and favoring one leg

10:53.434 --> 10:56.801
and limping
on the other three.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.534
It broke my heart.

10:59.567 --> 11:03.033
It seemed to me
he won that money for me,

11:03.067 --> 11:05.667
so I felt I should
return the favor.

11:05.701 --> 11:08.300
So I went up
to the owner

11:08.334 --> 11:09.634
and I asked him

11:09.667 --> 11:12.067
how much would it cost me
to buy that horse.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.234
And he said,
"How much you got?"

11:14.267 --> 11:17.267
And, would you believe it?
It was the same.

11:18.501 --> 11:20.133
Huh?

11:20.167 --> 11:21.300
Bobby.

11:21.334 --> 11:22.634
Yeah?

11:22.667 --> 11:25.467
You want to give me a hand
with the saddle here?

11:25.501 --> 11:26.467
Yeah, sure.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.801
Ask him what
he's going to do

11:28.834 --> 11:30.467
with a racehorse.

11:30.501 --> 11:33.467
What are you going to do
with a racehorse, Jim?!

11:33.501 --> 11:35.501
I'm, uh, giving him his freedom.

11:35.534 --> 11:37.434
He's giving him
his... What?

11:37.467 --> 11:39.067
ALEX:
Hey! Hey!

11:39.100 --> 11:41.901
Hey, come on, everybody,
let's get that horse!

11:41.934 --> 11:44.667
How are we going
to catch a horse?

11:44.701 --> 11:46.667
He's a 300-to-one shot.

11:46.701 --> 11:48.200
We can outrun him.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.234
ALEX:
Oh, boy.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.100
Let him go,
everybody.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.200
I want him to be free.

12:01.234 --> 12:03.033
Jim, you can't just
let a horse run free

12:03.067 --> 12:04.567
on the streets of New York.

12:04.601 --> 12:06.200
Jim, this is not
the frontier.

12:06.234 --> 12:08.167
There's no place
for On Dasher to go

12:08.200 --> 12:09.667
on the streets
of New York.

12:09.701 --> 12:11.701
Alex, don't call him On Dasher.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.300
That was his slave name.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.434
Oh.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.000
Well, what's
his new name?

12:16.033 --> 12:17.467
Uh...

12:18.801 --> 12:20.868
uh... Gary.

12:20.901 --> 12:24.501
Gary. That's
a nice name. Gary.

12:24.534 --> 12:27.667
Get that ugly, smelly,

12:27.701 --> 12:30.534
dirty creature
out of my garage,

12:30.567 --> 12:33.801
and tell him
to take his horse with him.

12:35.868 --> 12:37.467
Now, Louie, would
you just calm down?

12:37.501 --> 12:38.501
We got a problem here.

12:38.534 --> 12:39.634
We're trying
to figure out

12:39.667 --> 12:40.901
what to do
with Jim's horse.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.067
Does the word glue
ring a bell with anybody?

12:44.100 --> 12:47.234
Hey, Louie,
that ain't nice, Louie.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.200
You want me to make it nice?

12:49.234 --> 12:52.067
We'll use the glue
to paste Easter seals.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.834
( <i>knock at door</i> )

13:07.400 --> 13:08.534
Hey.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.934
Hi. Hey, how you doing?

13:09.968 --> 13:11.701
Glad you guys
could come over.

13:11.734 --> 13:12.767
Hi, Jim.

13:12.801 --> 13:13.868
Hi.

13:15.901 --> 13:19.634
I, uh... like
your place, uh, Jim.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.200
It's...
it's you, Jim.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.267
When I first got it,
it was a fixer-upper.

13:29.968 --> 13:31.534
Nice kitchen.

13:31.567 --> 13:32.801
Thanks.

13:34.634 --> 13:38.300
You get all your
electricity off that?

13:38.334 --> 13:39.901
Yeah, I have to.

13:39.934 --> 13:42.501
It's a condemned
building.

13:42.534 --> 13:44.834
No kidding.

13:44.868 --> 13:47.267
Yeah. The other
end's plugged in

13:47.300 --> 13:49.701
to the apartment
across the way.

13:49.734 --> 13:51.901
I hang my laundry
on the cord

13:51.934 --> 13:53.534
so they don't notice.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.300
Hey, Jim, you know,
now that you got

13:55.334 --> 13:56.667
some steady money
coming in,

13:56.701 --> 13:58.701
don't you think you
could afford to move?

13:58.734 --> 14:00.901
Nah. I kind of
like living here.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.767
The great thing
about living

14:02.801 --> 14:04.400
in a condemned
building

14:04.434 --> 14:06.701
is that nothing
can happen to it.

14:06.734 --> 14:09.534
I mean,
what are they going to do--

14:09.567 --> 14:11.534
come along and save it?

14:16.501 --> 14:18.601
Hey, Jim, uh...
where's Gary?

14:18.634 --> 14:19.934
Shh!

14:19.968 --> 14:22.667
He's asleep
in the bedroom.

14:24.734 --> 14:26.501
Ah! Well, how's
he been doing

14:26.534 --> 14:28.334
the past couple
of weeks?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.434
Oh, fine.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.434
I got him some hay
and a horse blanket

14:33.467 --> 14:36.667
and lots of good food,
and I got a heater

14:36.701 --> 14:38.467
to keep the room warm.

14:38.501 --> 14:40.400
Every horse
in the world

14:40.434 --> 14:42.701
should be
treated that good.

14:42.734 --> 14:46.968
Yeah. I take him out for
walks in the park every day.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.300
Oh, yeah?

14:48.334 --> 14:50.434
I imagine you must get
some funny looks, huh?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.133
Yeah...

14:52.167 --> 14:54.767
but those poodle people
have stopped acting

14:54.801 --> 14:56.968
like they own the place.

15:01.634 --> 15:05.200
Say, uh, why don't you guys
make yourself comfortable

15:05.234 --> 15:07.400
and tell me what you found out.

15:07.434 --> 15:10.300
Well, mainly
that there's
less of a demand

15:10.334 --> 15:12.767
for used horses
in midtown Manhattan

15:12.801 --> 15:14.634
than you might
think, Jim.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.400
I checked the Police Academy,

15:16.434 --> 15:18.133
but they only use
young, healthy horses.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.734
We still didn't get an answer
on that ad in the paper.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.801
There's dude ranches,
if you want

15:22.834 --> 15:25.167
to take him someplace--
like Arizona.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.033
Oh... it might do him good.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.234
He's got a bad cough.

15:30.267 --> 15:33.634
He's had it
ever since I got him.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.033
Can't seem to kick it.

15:42.968 --> 15:45.467
Jim, you know,
if he has a cough,

15:45.501 --> 15:48.634
maybe you should have
a vet look at him.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.968
I did.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.767
He said I might have to, uh,
bring him in next week

15:53.801 --> 15:54.901
for some tests.

15:54.934 --> 15:57.501
Said he'd like
to take a look at me

15:57.534 --> 15:58.834
while he's at it.

16:02.868 --> 16:05.567
Walnuts?

16:05.601 --> 16:08.000
Right on, Jim,
right on.

16:11.968 --> 16:14.501
TONY:
So that means we're no better
off than when we started.

16:14.534 --> 16:15.667
Nobody wants this horse.

16:15.701 --> 16:16.801
That's right.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.534
Well, you know,
I'm kind of glad

16:19.567 --> 16:21.033
no one wants him.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.400
I've been alone
a long time,

16:23.434 --> 16:27.667
and I'm kind of
getting used to
having him around.

16:27.701 --> 16:31.534
It's great
having someone
to have dinner with,

16:31.567 --> 16:34.734
you know, watch TV
with, uh, talk to.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.534
Hey, Jim, you got
a nutcracker?

16:36.567 --> 16:37.934
Right in front
of you.

16:39.367 --> 16:40.934
You mean the table?

16:40.968 --> 16:44.934
By golly, I guess
that could be used
as a table.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.934
Uh, you're not doing it right.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.501
( <i>cracking</i> )

17:14.032 --> 17:16.666
Well, thanks a lot, Jim.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.133
Want another?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.733
I think I'll just
save mine for later.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.166
You guys.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.701
( <i>cracking</i> )

17:29.267 --> 17:30.501
Hey, Jim?

17:30.534 --> 17:32.634
You think he's going
to wake up soon,

17:32.667 --> 17:33.968
so we could say hello?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.267
He's got to be.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.968
He's been asleep quite a while.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.334
Oh?

17:39.367 --> 17:41.701
Incidentally, you know,
it's not true

17:41.734 --> 17:44.834
what they say about horses
sleeping standing up.

17:44.868 --> 17:47.367
Really? How does he sleep?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.033
Uh... like this.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.601
Uh, Jim, I, uh...

18:03.634 --> 18:04.868
Jim, uh, tell me, uh,

18:04.901 --> 18:07.467
how long has he been
sleeping like that?

18:07.501 --> 18:10.501
Uh, since the day
before yesterday.

18:10.534 --> 18:11.934
The day
before yesterday.

18:11.968 --> 18:13.334
I guess winning that race

18:13.367 --> 18:15.133
took a lot out of him.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.300
Quite a bit.

18:16.334 --> 18:17.634
Jim, uh, you mind

18:17.667 --> 18:19.968
if I go and
take a look at him?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.200
Sure, go ahead.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.434
Hey, Bobby,
don't wake him up.

18:33.601 --> 18:34.968
Which one?

18:41.968 --> 18:43.834
Which is the guest room?

18:43.868 --> 18:45.367
I'm not sure.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.968
Jim, uh...

19:02.400 --> 19:03.968
I-I'm afraid that...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.033
that Gary
isn't going to go

19:06.067 --> 19:08.667
for any more walks
with you, Jim.

19:10.267 --> 19:11.801
Oh, no.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.968
Gary?

19:19.767 --> 19:23.100
Hey, Bobby,
what are you talking about?

19:25.501 --> 19:27.400
The horse
hung himself?

19:28.567 --> 19:31.100
Tony, he died.

19:39.267 --> 19:42.434
He's taking it harder
than I thought he would.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.801
Yeah. I wish we
could do something

19:44.834 --> 19:47.534
to pick him up
a little bit,
you know?

19:49.734 --> 19:51.234
Hey, Jim?

19:52.534 --> 19:54.834
How you doing, Jim?

19:55.934 --> 19:58.133
That apartment
seems real empty

19:58.167 --> 19:59.634
without that horse.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.501
You know, I'm really
surprised at you, Jim.

20:05.534 --> 20:07.701
Here, Gary's been gone
a couple of days,

20:07.734 --> 20:09.801
and we haven't had
a service for him.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.634
A service?

20:11.667 --> 20:14.267
Yeah. You know,
you may not have noticed,

20:14.300 --> 20:16.334
but a lot of guys
in the garage

20:16.367 --> 20:18.534
are really feeling
down about him.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.167
Well, I'm not surprised.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.234
That horse didn't have
an enemy in the world.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.868
Well, you're a man
of the cloth, Jim.

20:28.901 --> 20:32.167
You mean, like
a memorial service?

20:32.200 --> 20:33.534
Yeah.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.634
You know, like
a simple eulogy.

20:35.667 --> 20:39.000
I mean, you must have
done it before, huh?

20:39.033 --> 20:40.534
Uh... I must have.

20:43.601 --> 20:46.400
Okay, uh... everybody?

20:46.434 --> 20:49.767
You want to gather around?

20:49.801 --> 20:54.868
Yeah, uh... we're going to have
a little service here for Gary.

20:54.901 --> 20:57.133
Uh... the horse,
uh... died.

20:57.167 --> 20:58.601
Bring a pew.

21:14.234 --> 21:15.968
Nice, Bob.

21:21.801 --> 21:23.834
Uh...

21:25.067 --> 21:27.167
Please be seated.

21:33.067 --> 21:37.467
I'll make this as brief
and simple as... possible,

21:37.501 --> 21:40.133
because I think that's the way

21:40.167 --> 21:42.400
he would have wanted it.

21:43.767 --> 21:51.734
Now, uh, I don't know
what faith Gary was raised in,

21:51.767 --> 21:55.067
but I know he was bred
and raised to run.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.367
When he was young,
he was fast,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.901
and I bet
it felt good.

22:00.934 --> 22:04.534
He put everything he had
into going as fast

22:04.567 --> 22:05.834
as he was able.

22:05.868 --> 22:09.901
But, as he got older,
something began to happen.

22:09.934 --> 22:14.501
He was running just as hard,
but all the other horses

22:14.534 --> 22:16.300
were passing him by.

22:16.334 --> 22:20.100
I don't know how much
animals understand,

22:20.133 --> 22:22.767
but Gary
must have wondered

22:22.801 --> 22:26.100
what the hell
was happening to him.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.400
Right up to the last,
you could see

22:28.434 --> 22:31.567
he thought that maybe,
if he could get out there

22:31.601 --> 22:35.033
on a fast track
on a warm day,

22:35.067 --> 22:36.801
it would all come back to him,

22:36.834 --> 22:39.834
because, in his heart,
he was still a two-year-old.

22:41.701 --> 22:45.567
I think, uh,
when your legs give out,

22:45.601 --> 22:49.067
it's nice to have people around

22:49.100 --> 22:53.000
who understand
what's in your heart.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.434
( <i>sobbing softly</i> )

22:58.467 --> 23:02.300
Well, I can't think
of anything else.

23:02.334 --> 23:04.634
Is that enough, Alex?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.300
Yes, that's
quite enough, Jim.

23:06.334 --> 23:07.901
Thank you.

23:07.934 --> 23:09.868
Don't worry about it.

23:09.901 --> 23:11.067
Yeah, I know.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.334
Take it easy.

23:22.067 --> 23:26.133
Hey, Ignatowski? Ignatowski?

23:32.501 --> 23:36.167
I'm, I... I really liked
what you said here.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.100
Thanks, boss.

23:42.501 --> 23:43.834
When the time comes,

23:43.868 --> 23:46.334
you think you could
do that for my ma?

23:46.367 --> 23:49.501
I mean, you
wouldn't even need

23:49.534 --> 23:51.267
to change
the words much.

23:53.601 --> 23:54.968
Anytime.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.234
Thanks, Iggy.
