00:00.666 --> 00:01.874
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:01.874 --> 00:03.416
GROOT: I am Groot!

00:03.416 --> 00:04.790
Well, how was I
supposed to know

00:04.790 --> 00:06.124
that rock monster was a lady?

00:06.124 --> 00:07.582
I am Groot.

00:07.582 --> 00:09.874
You're hungry?
I'm starving to death.

00:09.874 --> 00:10.666
I could eat my own fur!

00:11.208 --> 00:12.208
Ugh!

00:13.416 --> 00:16.166
Groot. Grocery shopping
is not our strong suit.

00:17.457 --> 00:19.000
I am Groot.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.041
Wait. The burgers
at this restaurant
are how thick?

00:22.333 --> 00:24.041
I am Groot!

00:24.041 --> 00:26.416
Okay. I think I can
figure out how to
get there. Let's go.

00:26.416 --> 00:27.291
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Destination set.</i>

00:27.291 --> 00:28.666
I am Groot.

00:28.666 --> 00:31.749
Who needs a GPS
when Rocket's at the controls?

00:31.749 --> 00:33.957
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Please return</i>
<i>to the highlighted route.</i>

00:33.957 --> 00:36.416
ROCKET: Hey, don't worry,
this black hole's
a shortcut I know.

00:36.416 --> 00:37.582
<i>Recalculating.</i>

00:37.582 --> 00:39.208
I told you,
shut that thing off.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.291
I'll get us there
any minute.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.541
<i>Make a legal U-turn.</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:43.333
ROCKET: What? Hey,
these weren't here before.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.333
Who left their asteroids
lying around?

00:45.333 --> 00:46.874
<i>Severe temperature warning.</i>

00:46.874 --> 00:49.291
GROOT: I am Groot.
ROCKET: Too close to that sun?

00:49.291 --> 00:52.874
Ridiculous. (CHUCKLES)
This is just the
normal temperatures.

00:52.874 --> 00:54.249
It's all in your head.

00:54.249 --> 00:56.249
<i>Returning to previous route.</i>

00:56.249 --> 01:00.291
ROCKET: No, it's not.
That's a completely
different black hole.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.416
Groot, I'm telling ya,
this is all part
of the shortcut.

01:02.416 --> 01:04.499
It's just a really
long shortcut.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.541
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Turn right.</i>

01:05.541 --> 01:06.499
Told ya.
I am Groot!

01:09.124 --> 01:11.124
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

01:11.124 --> 01:12.582
This is all your fault.

01:12.582 --> 01:14.749
Why didn't you tell me
it closed so early?

01:14.749 --> 01:17.333
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have
taken the shortcut!

01:19.166 --> 01:20.249
(FLIES BUZZING)

01:24.915 --> 01:26.374
I am Groot.

01:26.374 --> 01:27.666
Sure, why not?
