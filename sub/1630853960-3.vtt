00:12.804 --> 00:15.932
God bless your hands,
Grandma. Tastiest <i>Kunafa </i>in the world.

00:16.016 --> 00:20.353
I'm glad to see you again, <i>habibi.</i>
I missed you so much, dear.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.105
God bless you, Grandma.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.233
I wish we could visit
the family more often?

00:25.316 --> 00:26.359
I wish that too.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.405
<i>Habibi</i>, your cousin Rima says
you have a relationship with Beyoncé.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.324
She has an idea for a song.
It's very good.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.743
I don't know Beyoncé.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.704
She's from Houston.
How could you not know her?

00:37.787 --> 00:42.250
<i>Habibi</i>, I gave your grandmother
a box of sneakers from your trunk.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.334
What are you saying?

00:43.418 --> 00:46.629
Why do you have over 20 pairs
of sunglasses? For what?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.299
Can I keep these?

00:51.634 --> 00:55.847
-Grandma, where did you get those?
-Mohammed has a tattoo.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.726
-No.
-May God forgive you.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.396
Why are you creating a scandal?
What are you doing? No, no…

01:03.480 --> 01:05.231
-Here it is.
-What?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.152
What the fuck?

01:09.235 --> 01:13.907
Relax, <i>habibi</i>. Take a drink.
It will calm your nerves.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.494
-What are you doing, Auntie?
-This drink will calm your nerves.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.954
-No, Grandma, no.
-It's so tasty.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.831
This is nonsense, I swear!

01:21.915 --> 01:23.458
-It'll calm you down.
-Why?

01:23.541 --> 01:25.376
This drink is so tasty.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
To your health, <i>habibi</i>.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.219
<i>Thank you for calling</i>
<i>DS White Law.</i>

02:16.302 --> 02:17.595
<i>If you've reached us after hours,</i>

02:17.679 --> 02:22.308
<i>please leave a message, and we will return</i>
<i>your call as soon as we possibly can.</i>

02:23.852 --> 02:26.146
-Bro, I coulda be peeing!
-Mama wants you.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.107
-You couldn't tell me through the door?
-Eye contact.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.316
<i>Message sent.</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:34.988
Damn it! Well, can't call them again.
We don't have time for this. Let's go.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.157
God forgive me.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.080
-Why do you play the diamond?
-You threw in diamonds.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.375
-I thought you were leading me in.
-No table talk during <i>Tarneeb</i>.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.711
How I can shut up
when this asshole plays like this?

02:49.794 --> 02:50.712
Just play.

02:50.795 --> 02:55.300
<i>Yalla</i>, it's mine anyway. <i>Aywa! Batizek.</i>
That's what you get for firing me.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.677
Did you find a lawyer?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.097
Not yet. It's hard to settle on one.
I don't want another Modad situation.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.309
I got a good lawyer.
Lizzie Horowitz, a good Jewish lawyer.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.103
Hey, man, I'm not looking
for a <i>My Cousin Vinny</i> thing.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.480
-It's how I got in this mess.
-Somebody play.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.276
You should pray for that type of lawyer,
a fast-talking genius who works for free.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.236
Mm. Fair point.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.031
I think Horowitz
is a good lawyer, actually.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.202
-What?
-What? Wait, you're agreeing with Aba?

03:22.285 --> 03:25.246
-A victory for the Jews.
-Hell is freezing over!

03:25.330 --> 03:27.999
-Come on, guys, I didn't mean it this way.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.669
I never agree with this guy, but she got
Ziyad his status, did you know that?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.922
-No, I didn't.
-That's why, but I don't agree--

03:34.005 --> 03:37.217
This woman's a very good lawyer.
She's my lawyer also. Lizzie.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.720
-Holy shit. You have a lawyer?
-Yeah. Shee foo. Crazy, man.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.765
Will you get us
another round of tea, please?

03:43.848 --> 03:45.266
I never have a clue of what he says.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
-Yeah, tea, okay.
-Okay, thank you.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.897
-Shee foo.
-<i>Yalla.</i> Play. You have to play, not the…

04:04.160 --> 04:06.412
All right. Fled Kuwait in '91.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.333
Applied for asylum,
fear of political persecution. Of course.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.837
-Delay. Delay. Delay.
-That doesn't bother you?

04:16.339 --> 04:20.176
Oh, no, actually,
it helps me find my zen, you know?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.428
-Sounds like someone peeing.

04:23.012 --> 04:26.599
If your bladder gets triggered,
there's a bathroom right down the hall.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.476
All right, denial of work permit,

04:28.559 --> 04:32.438
re-issued a date, court rescheduled,
reissued another date,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.276
court rescheduled again.
Your 2017 date was--

04:36.359 --> 04:38.027
Yeah, Hurricane Harvey.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.907
Yeah. Our court date
was reassigned 36 months later.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.202
This is like a depressing
<i>Groundhog's Day.</i> I'm so sorry.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.414
How's your file much bigger than Modad's?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.624
It's a lot, I know,
but it's really helpful.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.503
I get the initial petition, the supporting
documents regarding the torture.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.340
-The psych evaluation to get your father--
-Hold on. The what?

05:00.967 --> 05:03.678
The asylum claim is based
on your father's torture.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.473
Having the supporting documents
really brings it all into focus.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.770
Oh, I'm sorry. Mo, I… Uh…

05:14.564 --> 05:16.983
-I thought that you knew about--
-Can I see that?

05:17.567 --> 05:18.484
Um…

05:19.444 --> 05:23.156
-There's some sensitive stuff in here.
-It's okay. Can I see it, please?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.491
Thank you.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.638
They put cigarettes out on his body.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.144
My mom signed this. She knew about it.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.856
How about we take a minute, and just, uh…

05:58.066 --> 06:01.069
No, I'm fine. I'm just, uh…
I'm just absorbing it. It's fine.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.242
Have… Have you ever spoken
to someone professionally?

06:08.910 --> 06:10.328
Well, you're a professional.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.206
I meant like a therapist, because…

06:13.706 --> 06:17.043
-I see a lot of trauma in my practice--
-I'm here for legal advice.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.797
All right. Let's get to work.
Do the legal thing.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.423
Please.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.220
Okay.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.880
Try some for me, <i>mama</i>. Open.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.591
Want some?

07:05.675 --> 07:06.801
No, bless you.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.678
I don't want any.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.555
What is the matter?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.141
I'm just not hungry.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.310
-You have diarrhea again?
-No, man. I don't diarrhea.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.521
-What do you mean "again"?
-Dunno.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.444
-Let's go to Funplex like old times.
-Okay.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.613
It's a weekday.
It'll be quiet. Come with me.

07:27.697 --> 07:31.159
You're a grown man, Hamoodi.
You wanna play games? What is that?

07:31.242 --> 07:34.245
-I have my shift in two hours.
-Well, call in sick.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.874
I can't. I'm perfectly healthy, Hamoodi.
You're the one with diarrhea.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.252
I don't have diarrhea, man.
Why do you keep saying… I don't…

07:42.170 --> 07:43.963
Whatever. To your health.

07:44.046 --> 07:44.922
Enjoy.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.351
Yes!

07:57.935 --> 07:58.895
Hi, baby.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.397
Missed you so much. Come here.

08:02.940 --> 08:06.652
Can you believe they got all these games
and no <i>Mortal Kombat</i> or <i>Street Fighter?</i>

08:10.114 --> 08:12.450
-Why are you looking at us like that?
-What's wrong?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.327
Because I love you guys.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.871
-I love you, babe, so much.
-I love you too.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.290
I love you all, so… I love you, babe.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.333
I love you, bro.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.001
All right.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.296
-No, for real. I love you.
-Okay, I love you too.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.881
-No, for real.
-No, I love you too.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.633
-Why are you pointing?
-For real--

08:28.716 --> 08:29.592
Get the hell off me.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.720
-We've known each other since 6th grade?
-Yeah.

08:32.803 --> 08:36.182
Remember we stole all the bathroom soaps,
put them in the fountain outside.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.310
And it all foamed over?
Then Doug was pissed off.

08:39.393 --> 08:43.189
He went, "It's slippery out here!
Who are the sonufabitches doing that?"

08:43.272 --> 08:45.149
-All right, Let's go play.
-All right.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.611
-Let's play. You're playing games!
-I'm not playing no games.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.571
-All right, bye, Mama.
-Bye, <i>habibi</i>.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.037
Afternoon, Curtis.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.045
All right.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.161
Congratulations,
here's the garlic Parmesan. Enjoy.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.101
Hey, Yusra.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.061
-<i>Habibti</i>, Linda.
-Mm-hm.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.896
How much for these bottles?

10:06.897 --> 10:09.275
Well, all together, uh, 50.

10:10.151 --> 10:10.985
Twenty.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.030
-Fifty.
-Twenty-five.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.781
Forty-five.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.409
Never mind, Linda.
I'll come another day.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.785
Forty, final offer.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.704
Forty?

10:23.164 --> 10:26.917
I can't find my wallet.
Linda, I have only this.

10:27.001 --> 10:31.380
-What am I supposed to do with that?
-Wait, my friend. Be patient.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.633
A small piece from this,

10:33.716 --> 10:36.218
you dip it with this, and now try.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.807
Mm!

10:41.891 --> 10:42.850
You like it?

10:42.933 --> 10:46.854
I like it. Yusra, this is the oil
we should have invaded Iraq for.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.816
You should be selling this stuff,
not haggling with it.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.868
Let's see how many tickets we get.
Go, baby, get it. Get it.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.788
Like throwing rocks.
Palestinians should be the best at this.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.623
Just gotta let it skip,
like… ba-ba-ba-bap.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.376
-Oh, that was--
-Shoot it, honey.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.129
-Let's call this what it is.
-What is it?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.840
-A slot machine for kids.
-Five tickets?

11:14.924 --> 11:18.761
See? It's very obvious this is grooming
kids to be degenerate gamblers.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.764
Another kiss. All right.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.479
Space Invaders. What do they know
about invaders? Die, bitch! Die!

11:28.562 --> 11:30.981
Where do you see a ring toss
at casinos? Look.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.316
I want more tickets.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.070
-Did you break it?
-No.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.531
Feels like a lot of murder,
is all I'm saying.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.866
It's a perfect location too.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.160
Half my customers
come from the north side anyway,

11:43.244 --> 11:45.496
so I'm thinking of starting
with some swangas.

11:45.579 --> 11:49.125
Hold on, you finna have a second shop
purely dedicated to slabs?

11:49.208 --> 11:53.587
That's the plan. Once the loan's approved,
then I can move forward with the lease.

11:53.671 --> 11:57.758
Hell yeah. About to have your boy
poking out here one time for the wheels.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.968
Any time.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.803
Mo,
why didn't you tell me about this?

12:02.012 --> 12:02.847
Shit!

12:03.639 --> 12:05.766
-Oh, he ain't listening.
-No, I was listening.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.812
Slabs, swangas, new location.
It's gonna be amazing, baby.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.151
Fuck Skee-Ball.
Probably has racist origins.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.071
Yo. What the hell's wrong with him?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.328
-You okay?
-Yeah, babe. Just having fun at Funplex.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.249
-Shut up!

12:30.332 --> 12:32.752
-Why is he heckling kids?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.380
Shut up, SpongeBob!

12:36.464 --> 12:37.923
Calm down, <i>habibi.</i>

12:38.007 --> 12:41.510
I'm fine.
This asshole keeps laughing at me.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.223
What?

12:51.061 --> 12:54.273
What the hell is wrong with him?
Let me give it a try.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.692
-Oh!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.360
Hold on. Okay.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.060
Mo!

13:31.811 --> 13:32.645
Shit.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.940
Let's go eat!

13:36.023 --> 13:37.817
Yeah. Okay, baby. I'm coming.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.655
-What's up with that new lawyer?
-She's on that vibe shit.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.449
-You know, yoga, "Om." You know.

13:45.533 --> 13:49.245
I went in there for legal advice,
and it turned into a therapy session.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.539
-You could use a session.
-Hell yeah.

13:51.622 --> 13:56.460
-Talk about what happened with SpongeBob.
-I don't believe in therapy. It's a scam.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.045
How's therapy a scam?

13:58.128 --> 14:01.006
Because you pay some Ph.D. $200 an hour

14:01.090 --> 14:03.259
when you could talk
to God for free anytime.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.927
I don't ever see you get on a prayer mat.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.680
Yeah, I don't walk around
with a prayer rug all the time.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.266
What am I, Aladdin?
This isn't Disney, okay?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.811
Islam is real practical.
I can just pray right here if I wanted to.

14:13.894 --> 14:17.398
Just take a tissue, put it on the ground.
Bam. Done. All right?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.442
Why don't you just talk to someone?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.279
Well, because…

14:24.405 --> 14:26.782
I'm not traumatized,
which is what she said.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
Oh. Because of the shooting?

14:29.910 --> 14:30.786
No, uh…

14:31.412 --> 14:32.371
I'm fine.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.666
Mo, you can't bring in the new
until you process the old.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.585
Niggas everywhere are figuring that out.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.045
You weighing in now?
You don't talk to anybody.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.591
Yes, I do. Every Wednesday at eight.
I holler at Dr. Mehta.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.802
You pay somebody $200 an hour?
I don't believe that shit.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.471
Hell no. I cut him a deal at the shop.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.266
He cuts me a deal with the sessions.
The barter system.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.435
That's the most Nigerian shit
I heard you say.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.563
All I know is
two haircuts equals 50 minutes

14:57.646 --> 15:00.816
of sweet and tantalizing
conversation with Dr. Mehta.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.152
Very simple thing. You should try it.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.612
I'm not gonna do that.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.327
Hey, Damon?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.749
-Hi.
-Hey, Sameer.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.709
I… Um…

15:18.792 --> 15:20.836
Could you… Do you have a minute to talk?

15:21.712 --> 15:22.880
Uh-huh.

15:23.964 --> 15:24.924
Chicken tahini.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.888
The newest flavor in the Chick'n Kong…
Chic'n Kong… I'm just nervous.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.432
-Chick'n Cone.
-Chick'n Cone's sauce lineup.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.351
-Uh-huh.
-My mom makes it.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.227
And it's really delicious.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.228
-Great.
-Yeah.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.147
But, oh no, I forgot.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.691
There's already one big idea here,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
and that's chicken in…

15:44.944 --> 15:47.488
-Waffles.
-Waffle cones.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.282
-Yeah.
-So you know what I mean, right?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.117
Yeah, yeah, I know, but, uh…

15:52.868 --> 15:55.287
because that's the sun
that our sauces orbit.

15:55.871 --> 15:59.291
I think we could attract more customers
if we bring my mom's sauce.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.962
-Because I think they'd like--
-Yeah. I'll think about that.

16:03.045 --> 16:07.007
I'll think about the "chicken-hini"
and your mom and the sauces.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.551
I'll think about that. Great initiative.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.096
-Chicken tahini.
-What's nine plus seven?

16:12.179 --> 16:13.806
-16.
-Okay, thank you very much.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.307
That's what I got too.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.977
Back to work, guys. Time is money.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.148
Miguel, you out of your mind?
This car will never sustain those tires.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.317
Take it back.
Take it to the warehouse.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.824
Hello?

16:31.907 --> 16:32.950
Uh, speaking.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.246
Um…

16:37.871 --> 16:42.668
I didn't apply for the cards, my dad did.
I didn't know of them until years later.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.256
Well, I haven't…
I haven't spoken to him in years.

16:48.549 --> 16:53.762
No, you're not understanding.
I didn't max out those cards. My dad did.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.932
No, no, no, but this loan is not personal.
It's for my LLC.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.684
Like, what… Fuck!

16:58.767 --> 17:01.520
<i>What are you saying?</i>
<i>I can never get a loan from a bank?</i>

17:02.646 --> 17:03.939
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:35.596
You fellas having a great time out there?

17:35.679 --> 17:38.766
Just remember, no smoking
that close to the stage, please.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.606
Hey, man, you with the hat.
Please put out your cigarette.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.113
Wrong fucking day.
I don't have time for this shit.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.867
Country-ass motherfucker.
Think you're tough, huh?

17:56.950 --> 17:59.745
All right. Let's see how tough you are.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.625
-Big guy, put that fucking cigarette out.
-What's up, Osama-bin-Pumpkin?

18:05.209 --> 18:09.755
-You got jokes? Put the cigarette out.
-Relax, man. It's a fucking strip club.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
Put it out, Amber's got asthma.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.470
Oh, shit. Well, I don't want to have
Amber having an asthma attack, so…

18:17.888 --> 18:20.432
Don't make me ask again,
put the fucking cigarette out.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.728
-Hey, man, it's out.
-No, it's not.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.231
-Stop doing that. It's out, man!
-It's not out.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.651
Now it's out.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.868
-Don't do it. Don't do it.
-Don't do this?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.121
-Don't do it.
-Hm? Don't do this?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.498
You know exactly
what the fuck I'm talking about. Don't.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.917
I said don't fucking do it, I said!

18:48.961 --> 18:52.881
-You motherfucker, don't--
-Do it, bitch! You like that?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.676
-I said put it out, fucking put it out!
-Mo!

18:56.176 --> 18:58.846
-What?
-I told you about the ninja shit.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.597
He was smoking inside.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.682
So?

19:01.765 --> 19:03.142
And it's illegal.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.478
It's a titty club.
Nobody gives a fuck about lungs here.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.522
Lungs are one of the most vital organs.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.315
But, motherfucker, you were smoking.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.942
By myself outside.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.155
Take your ass back outside
because you're fired.

19:16.238 --> 19:20.742
-No, I got a lot going on. Please don't.
-No, no, no. Don't "Rich" me, bitch.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.704
You argue with my customers,
and now you argue with me?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.583
No, I knew you weren't Dreams material.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.585
Get his ass the fuck outta here.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.298
This the Samoan you were talking about?

19:36.049 --> 19:40.137
-Dreams, more like a damn nightmare.
-Everybody get back to business.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.598
Get the asses dropping, titties popping.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.226
Shouldn't be working here
in the first fucking place. Get off me.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.981
This is Dreams, where all
your motherfucking dreams come true!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.251
How was work?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.465
I think
I need to talk to somebody.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.179
Okay.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.932
I got you.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.895
-Is this a good idea?
-Yes, trust me.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.481
This is the best way to unburden yourself.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.034
-What are you doing?
-It's what we do at the mosque.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.619
It's disrespectful here.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.415
Disrespectful to walk in with all kinds
of dog sh-- stuff that's out there.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.459
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
It's a place of worship.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.712
Okay. Someone might trip, though.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.675
Okay, fine, fine. One step at a time.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.886
-You have Zamzam water here?
-Here.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.764
Jeez, I told you, baby,
I'm not comfortable with that.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.101
Okay, I'll do it.
God forgive me.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.478
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.340
It's the OG hijab.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.058
You just go in there?

22:40.025 --> 22:41.777
This is just like my bedroom.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.243
Amen.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.456
How long since your last confession,
my son?

22:56.166 --> 22:59.503
Mind just sticking with "Mo"?
We just met, you know?

23:01.463 --> 23:03.423
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.802
I'm Muslim.
We usually confess straight to God.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.554
What's on your mind, Mo?

23:12.182 --> 23:13.934
Can we start with the cross?

23:14.684 --> 23:18.355
You always have Jesus on there
with nails in his hands and his feet.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.400
Thorns on his head
and blood's coming down.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.569
Why do you have to eat
the body and drink the blood?

23:24.653 --> 23:28.198
It's just a little much, don't you think?
You bring your kids here?

23:28.281 --> 23:30.742
I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
Just trying to understand.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.703
I love Jesus. I believe in Jesus.
Jesus was Palestinian.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.249
Isn't it a torture device?
I mean, why glorify it?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.669
Well, there's no glory in suffering,

23:40.752 --> 23:42.379
but there is in sacrifice.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.552
I'm sorry.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.848
My father was tortured.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.392
It happened years ago, but…

23:56.643 --> 23:57.686
I just found out.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.938
It pains me to hear that, Mo.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.942
How's that make you feel?

24:05.694 --> 24:06.611
Just angry.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.865
I'm angry at myself.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.033
Yourself?

24:16.955 --> 24:19.624
My father sent us to Houston,
two years ahead.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.964
Two years. I didn't see him.
I had to be the man of the house.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.842
I couldn't live up to that.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.054
I didn't know what he was doing there.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.140
And I resented him.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.060
I was just kept in the dark.

24:40.812 --> 24:41.813
But now I know.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.610
He sacrificed so much.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.656
They put cigarettes out on his body.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.917
But he held it together.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.589
I get grazed by a bullet,
and I'm addicted to lean.

25:08.089 --> 25:08.924
It's a joke.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.553
My father came from nothing and…

25:14.971 --> 25:17.057
became a telecommunications engineer.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.435
What am I?
Can't even hold a job at a strip club.

25:21.269 --> 25:24.439
You know, we lost a lot of Houston legends
from sipping lean,

25:25.023 --> 25:27.734
but everyone processes
their pain differently.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.072
And it doesn't matter
what you do for a living.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.490
Jesus was a carpenter.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.493
Let me ask you this, Mo,

25:37.160 --> 25:40.413
you think your father would want you
to beat yourself up over this

25:40.497 --> 25:42.791
or would he want you to find happiness?

26:07.816 --> 26:08.733
Thank you.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.405
-Hey, Buddy.
-Hey!

26:13.488 --> 26:15.115
-Do you remember me?

26:15.198 --> 26:17.909
-Mo, right?
-Yes, sir.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.829
-I bought those trackers you mentioned.
-Oh, yeah?

26:20.912 --> 26:22.455
Yeah. What's going on?

26:22.539 --> 26:25.584
I… I was wondering if you need
an extra pair of hands.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.043
Well…

26:28.336 --> 26:30.463
I need somebody
to help me set up the trackers.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.384
I don't have the sense God gave an ant
when it comes to technology.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.887
Might as well be you.
You start Monday morning,00 a.m.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.347
-Yes, sir.
-All right.
