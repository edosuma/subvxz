- Nothin'.

00:07.539 --> 00:08.603
Everything.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.935
Rayna, I want you to meet Juliette Barnes.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.359
My mama was one of your biggest fans.

00:14.387 --> 00:17.055
She said she'd listen to you
while I was still in her belly.

00:17.090 --> 00:18.874
I wish the new record
was performing better.

00:18.908 --> 00:20.475
You've gotta find your place
in the new market.

00:20.510 --> 00:22.344
(Rayna) You are not
seriously suggesting

00:22.395 --> 00:25.063
that I open
for Juliette Barnes.

00:25.098 --> 00:26.598
I need to know your decision.

00:26.632 --> 00:28.100
Well, you can kiss my decision
as it's walking out the door.

00:28.134 --> 00:29.434

00:29.468 --> 00:31.403
Why don't you come take over
for buddy as my bandleader?

00:31.437 --> 00:32.686
I can't do that to Rayna.

00:32.738 --> 00:34.439
You and I could have
a lot of fun on the road.

(Rayna) Okay, Bucky,

for suggesting you tour
with Juliette Barnes

03:10.613 --> 03:11.813
pretty much guarantees

03:11.847 --> 03:13.014
they'll be no further support
for the record.

03:13.065 --> 03:14.366
All right.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.269
Where's the good news?
Where's the idea?

03:17.303 --> 03:18.203
Okay, I saw
these two kids singing

03:18.237 --> 03:19.955
at the bluebird
the other night.

03:19.989 --> 03:21.640
I haven't seen
that kind of chemistry

03:21.674 --> 03:23.892
since you and Deacon
in the beginning.

03:23.926 --> 03:26.244
So I'm thinking
you should get back

03:26.278 --> 03:28.730
to what made you want to do this
in the first place.

03:28.781 --> 03:30.915
You and Deacon should go out
on the road together...

03:30.950 --> 03:33.151
just the two of you.

03:33.185 --> 03:35.119
No.

03:35.137 --> 03:37.522
Watty, that's a crazy idea. Mm.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.357
Not really, no.
If you can't afford a big tour

03:39.392 --> 03:41.576
and you are dead set against
opening for Juliette Barnes...

03:41.610 --> 03:42.911
Yes, I am.

03:42.945 --> 03:44.195
Then this is a great solution.

03:44.229 --> 03:47.315
Instead of half-filled areas,
we book smaller venues.

03:47.350 --> 03:50.001
Now you have a sold-out tour
that actually makes money.

03:50.019 --> 03:52.771
And you get to do
something intimate, personal,

03:52.805 --> 03:54.856
music you actually
care about again.

03:54.890 --> 03:57.075
Remember those love songs
you guys used to write?

03:57.109 --> 03:58.860
That's 'cause we were in love.

03:58.894 --> 04:00.462
That was a long time ago, Watty.

04:00.496 --> 04:02.647
We'd just go on stage and pour
our hearts out to each other.

04:02.682 --> 04:04.349
I don't think we could
pull that off now.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.085
I can't imagine what Deacon would
think of the idea. (Door closes)

04:07.119 --> 04:08.653
Hey, you beat me.

04:08.688 --> 04:09.971

04:13.759 --> 04:15.043
What'd I miss?

04:15.077 --> 04:18.529
You and Deacon
on the road together...

04:18.564 --> 04:20.515
Sleeping on the same tour bus?

04:20.548 --> 04:22.417
<i>That's</i> the idea?

04:22.451 --> 04:23.785
Well, you know,

04:23.819 --> 04:25.804
it's that tour we did together
for years.

04:25.838 --> 04:27.522
Mm-hmm, when you were dating.

04:27.556 --> 04:28.890
(Chuckles)

04:28.941 --> 04:31.126
Well, obviously,
that part would be different.

04:33.579 --> 04:34.713
Come on, babe.

04:34.747 --> 04:37.499
This is important to me.
I really need this.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.384
You want me to say
I'm comfortable when I'm not?

04:39.402 --> 04:41.119
I didn't think it was about
being comfortable.

04:41.153 --> 04:42.420
I mean, I wasn't comfortable

04:42.454 --> 04:44.689
when you decided
to run for mayor.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.792
I wasn't comfortable when daddy
stabbed Coleman in the back.

04:50.379 --> 04:52.747
At least I'm coming to you
to talk about it

04:52.782 --> 04:54.282
before I make the decision.

04:54.316 --> 04:56.468
Baby, I'm up to my eyeballs.

04:56.502 --> 04:58.119
I've got a debate with Coleman
to prepare for.

04:58.154 --> 05:00.571
There's a "meet the candidate"
cocktail party on Wednesday.

05:00.589 --> 05:01.973
I'd love it
if you'd come with me.

05:02.007 --> 05:04.025
Then there's
this vulnerability study

05:04.060 --> 05:05.777
that our campaign consultants
want both of us to do.

05:05.811 --> 05:07.078
What's that?

05:07.113 --> 05:08.830
They're just looking
for anything past or present

05:08.864 --> 05:10.498
that Coleman can use
to hurt the campaign.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.267
Well, you know,
I spent my entire career

05:12.301 --> 05:14.386
keeping my personal life
private.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.037
Look, it's standard
operating procedure.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.490
All candidates go through it.
It's not that big of a deal.

05:18.557 --> 05:21.076
I'm not a candidate.
But it's important to me.

05:21.110 --> 05:22.510
Can that just be enough?

05:25.230 --> 05:27.082

another album.

14:45.499 --> 14:47.951

I've got to go.

15:06.670 --> 15:07.587
(Clears throat) Hello, daddy.

15:07.621 --> 15:09.172
So why would you ever go

15:09.206 --> 15:12.492
to the home
of your husband's opponent?

15:12.526 --> 15:16.512
Oh, you mean the home of the man
who basically grew up with us?

15:16.546 --> 15:18.915
'Cause I was trying to do
the decent thing,

15:18.949 --> 15:20.683
'cause our family owes Coleman
an apology.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.735
You owe Coleman an apology.

15:22.770 --> 15:24.938
This whole thing you've gotten
our family involved with

15:24.989 --> 15:26.706
is just ridiculous.

15:26.757 --> 15:28.291
(Scoffs)

15:28.309 --> 15:31.077
And what is
this vulnerability study?

15:31.111 --> 15:33.129
It's insurance

15:33.163 --> 15:37.317
that our past transgressions
won't become our undoing.

15:38.669 --> 15:40.386
I'm sorry you feel
so threatened by it.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.005
Maybe...

15:42.039 --> 15:43.956
Maybe if you felt
you had nothing to hide...

15:43.974 --> 15:45.792
oh, keep it up, daddy,

15:45.826 --> 15:48.344
'cause, you know,
I'm just gonna stop showing up.

15:48.395 --> 15:49.779
Okay? I guess we'll
just have to find a way

15:49.813 --> 15:51.748
to muddle through without you.

15:51.799 --> 15:55.235
There must be somebody

18:05.810 --> 18:07.311
You...

18:07.329 --> 18:10.247

18:23.369 --> 18:26.771
Yeah. Yeah, it, uh, it gets
lonely for me and the girls.

18:26.789 --> 18:28.190
Ever have a girlfriend?

18:28.224 --> 18:29.474
What? No.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.193
Have you ever paid anyone to...

18:31.227 --> 18:32.577
wait. Are... are you kidding me?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.995
Of course not.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.698
Mr. Conrad, the more we know,
the more we can protect you.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.766
Let's talk about

18:37.800 --> 18:38.967
your real estate business.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.118
That's an area where
Coleman Carlisle

18:40.153 --> 18:41.370
is certainly gonna target.

18:41.404 --> 18:43.138
In 2007, your investment group

18:43.172 --> 18:46.091
purchased a $75-million tract of
land along the cumberland river.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.225
That's correct.

18:47.243 --> 18:48.960
Cumberland Plaza development.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.128
And you served two terms

18:50.163 --> 18:51.463
on the board
of the music city credit union,

18:51.497 --> 18:53.382
which had a substantial
investment in that project.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.866
Mm-hmm. It's not unusual.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.335
But you resigned right before
your cumberland deal fell apart.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.137
My resignation from
the credit union had nothing

18:59.172 --> 19:01.005

30:24.525 --> 30:25.508
Hey.

30:25.542 --> 30:27.760
(Whispers) Hi.

30:27.778 --> 30:33.383
I don't know too many guys
who can pull off fringe.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.151
You're really not one of 'em.

30:35.185 --> 30:36.853
(Chuckles)

30:36.904 --> 30:40.657
I have a feeling you didn't come
here just to mock my outfit.

30:42.159 --> 30:43.626
No, I want to talk to you.

30:43.661 --> 30:46.262
Um...

30:46.296 --> 30:47.947
I can't do this...

30:47.982 --> 30:49.098
this Watty thing.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.884
I-I want to.

30:51.919 --> 30:53.720
Believe me, there is a huge part
of me that wants to,

30:53.754 --> 30:55.388
but I can't.

30:55.422 --> 30:58.191
Because of Avery?

30:58.225 --> 30:59.692
Because of me.

31:00.878 --> 31:03.146
I moved out here
to be with him,

31:03.180 --> 31:04.830
and I want my life with him,

31:04.848 --> 31:08.334
and I don't want to do anything
that's gonna mess that up.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.305
If doing something
you're clearly born to do

31:12.339 --> 31:13.672
messes that up,

31:13.691 --> 31:16.109
then what kind of life is that
anyway?

31:16.143 --> 31:19.195
This is Watty White. He...

31:19.246 --> 31:21.514
You think he drives around

31:21.548 --> 31:25.501
offering to produce
people's demos every day?

31:25.536 --> 31:30.106
He discovered Rayna Jaymes,
and he wants to work with us.

31:30.140 --> 31:34.074
There is no us without... you.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.129
Look, forget me, all right,

31:39.180 --> 31:41.715
forget Avery.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.517
What do <i>you</i> want?

31:43.551 --> 31:45.803
I want to be more than a guy
who runs the soundboard

31:45.837 --> 31:49.289
and plays
at some two-bit motel.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.824
You want to be more
than a waitress

31:50.842 --> 31:53.243
and somebody's girlfriend,
right?

31:54.979 --> 31:56.430
And you really want to be
with somebody

31:56.464 --> 31:59.750
who won't let you be
who you are?

31:59.784 --> 32:01.835
No, Avery will support me,
whatever I do.

32:01.870 --> 32:04.204
Well, then what's the problem?

32:09.027 --> 32:10.928
There. I did it.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.145
Thank you.

32:15.416 --> 32:17.467
Thank you.

32:21.222 --> 32:24.057
It's your career.
I couldn't very well say no.

32:24.092 --> 32:26.360
Well, you're right.

32:26.394 --> 32:28.428
You're 100% right.

32:28.463 --> 32:29.829
I didn't ask you
about any of this,

32:29.847 --> 32:32.182
and I know that
you're not on board, so...

32:32.216 --> 32:34.935
with your campaign, no.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.120
With you being happy again?

32:39.424 --> 32:40.874
Yeah.

32:40.909 --> 32:42.342
Of course I am.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.144
I know.

32:44.178 --> 32:46.246
And it should be
a two-way street.

32:46.281 --> 32:48.732
Rayna, you've shown up,
you've stood by me,

32:48.766 --> 32:50.684
and you've supported me
through something

32:50.718 --> 32:53.520
I know that you are really
not all that happy about.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.672
And I want to do
the same for you.

33:01.810 --> 33:04.779
(Birds chirping)

33:16.107 --> 33:17.925
I swear, I'm not stalking you.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.293
(Laughs)

33:19.344 --> 33:21.295
I finished the song.

33:21.346 --> 33:22.730
Oh, yeah?

33:22.764 --> 33:24.482
Yeah. It's just a little demo
I made at my house,

33:24.516 --> 33:25.917
so don't let anybody hear it.

33:25.951 --> 33:28.069
If you like it,
I'd like to record it.

33:28.103 --> 33:29.570
That's great.

33:32.407 --> 33:34.742
How do you like that guitar?

33:34.793 --> 33:36.961
I love that guitar.

33:36.995 --> 33:38.145
But I can't keep it.

33:38.180 --> 33:40.181
I want you to,

33:40.232 --> 33:42.700
'cause I want you to play it
on that track.

33:42.718 --> 33:45.620
Look, you listen to it
and tell me what you think.

33:45.671 --> 33:47.188
What do <i>you</i> think?

33:49.608 --> 33:53.544
I think...

33:53.579 --> 33:56.664
I think something about you
makes me want to grow up.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.487
(Car door opens and closes)

34:03.522 --> 34:04.889
(Engine starts)

34:12.501 --> 34:15.286
So how far back
did you gentlemen go?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.804
We went all the day back
to his kindergarten teacher,

34:17.822 --> 34:20.675
his college buddies,
fraternity brothers.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.243
The only area
of real concern is

34:22.261 --> 34:24.043
around
that cumberland Plaza deal.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.179
He didn't seem
100% forthcoming on that.

34:26.214 --> 34:27.614
(Tandy) That deal
wiped him out.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.766
I don't wonder why he doesn't
like talking about it.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.985
It did more than wipe him out.

34:31.018 --> 34:32.620
It bankrupted
a lot of good people.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.505
So you think he's lying
about something?

34:34.556 --> 34:36.474
If I had to lay odds,
I'd bet 5 to 1

34:36.507 --> 34:38.458
there's something fishy
in that whole mess.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.027
If it's there, we'll catch it.

34:40.062 --> 34:42.230
At least he had the good sense
not to tell us.

34:42.264 --> 34:43.815
That gives me hope for the boy.

34:43.849 --> 34:44.899
Daddy.

34:44.933 --> 34:46.300
I'm just saying,

34:46.335 --> 34:50.188
a mayor with secrets is
easier to control.
