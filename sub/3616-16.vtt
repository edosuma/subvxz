BUT A LITTLE "SHUSH"
WITH SOME SYRUP ON IT

A HEAVENLY HANDYMAN.

HOW WE MET.

01:42.697 --> 01:44.599

THE ELDERS WANT ME
TO CHECK OUT

01:45.700 --> 01:47.615
A POTENTIAL WHITELIGHTER.
SHE'S A SCHOOLTEACHER
ABOUT TO FALL OFF THE PATH.

01:47.625 --> 01:50.439
SHE NEEDS
SOME INSPIRATION.

01:50.539 --> 01:51.565
SPEAKING
OF INSPIRATION,

01:51.665 --> 01:53.690
IT'S
THE 60th ANNIVERSARY

01:53.791 --> 01:55.360
OF THE BATTLE
OF GUADALCANAL,

01:55.460 --> 01:56.902
AND THEY'RE
HAVING A REUNION

01:57.002 --> 01:59.196
FOR LOCAL VETERANS,
SO I RSVP'D FOR IT.

01:59.296 --> 02:01.613

I CAN'T BE SEEN THERE.

02:01.713 --> 02:03.158
WELL, NO, IT'S OK.

02:03.258 --> 02:04.616
I TOLD THEM THAT YOU
WERE YOUR GRANDSON.

02:04.716 --> 02:07.161
WELL, THAT'S NOT IT.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.454
I--I DON'T WANT TO GO,

02:08.554 --> 02:10.330

IF YOU WOULD'VE ASKED ME
OR TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT

02:11.727 --> 02:13.684
INSTEAD OF JUST
MAKING DECISIONS FOR ME.

02:22.233 --> 02:25.634
I'LL BET
SHE SCARES EASILY.

02:25.734 --> 02:28.472
CAN I SCARE HER?

02:28.572 --> 02:29.764
NO.

02:29.864 --> 02:30.807
COME ON, RICK.

02:30.907 --> 02:32.058

02:36.161 --> 02:37.437
COULD BE THE WIND,
COULD BE A GHOST.

02:37.537 --> 02:39.646

I SWEAR,
SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHY I STAY HERE WITH YOU.

02:49.755 --> 02:53.285
BECAUSE I STAYED
WITH YOU, BRO.

02:53.385 --> 02:54.910
I PROMISED TO PROTECT YOU
WHEN WE ENLISTED,
AND I FAILED.

02:55.011 --> 02:57.788
I'M NOT GONNA FAIL AGAIN.

02:57.888 --> 02:59.390

05:37.276 --> 05:38.428

WANT TO TALK TO HIM

05:38.528 --> 05:40.887

WHY HE'S SO MAD AT ME.

05:40.987 --> 05:42.889
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE

05:42.989 --> 05:44.433
IT'S JUST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO TO THE REUNION.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.727
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE,
I DON'T KNOW,

05:46.827 --> 05:48.687
HE DIED AT GUADALCANAL.

05:48.787 --> 05:50.271
YEAH, BUT HE DIED A HERO.

05:50.371 --> 05:52.982

COME TO THINK OF IT,

TALK ABOUT IT VERY MUCH.

THAT I CAME IN HERE

TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL THE CHATTER, OK?

AND WHAT WE DO, PROBABLY NOT.

A LITTLE MORE DISCREET.

UNFORTUNATELY.

TO MAKE PHOEBE'S HOME
FEEL CRAMPED AND UNLIVABLE.

OF A BETTER LIFE.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.482

TO COVER ME AT WORK,

I SUSPENDED HIM,

11:00.431 --> 11:02.292

TO BE A TEACHER,

11:14.318 --> 11:16.094

AT THE COST OF MY LIFE.

11:16.195 --> 11:18.889

I'VE DECIDED TO QUIT.

11:18.989 --> 11:20.515

THE COURAGE TO STAY.

11:34.585 --> 11:37.697

COURAGE THAT MATTERS

11:37.797 --> 11:40.408
IS THE KIND
THAT GETS YOU FROM
ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT.

11:40.508 --> 11:42.702
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST FOCUS ON THAT.

11:42.802 --> 11:46.119
YOU BILL AS A PLUMBER
OR A THERAPIST?

11:46.220 --> 11:49.540
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO STOP THE LEAK,

11:49.641 --> 11:52.585
WHICH, UH, BY THE WAY,
IS HEALED.

11:52.685 --> 11:56.047
I MEAN, SEALED.

11:56.147 --> 11:57.547
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

11:57.647 --> 11:59.649
THIS ONE'S ON THE HOUSE.

12:02.610 --> 12:06.680
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S
A POTION IN HERE
TO VANQUISH GHOSTS?

12:06.780 --> 12:10.140
YEAH. YOU POUR IT
OVER THEIR BONES.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.560
WE USED IT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.979
THAT'S WEIRD. LOOK AT THIS.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.147
WHAT IS IT?

12:18.247 --> 12:19.148
LEO'S MEDAL OF HONOR,

12:19.248 --> 12:21.610
AND IT'S JUST STUFFED
IN HIS OLD ARMY FILE

12:21.710 --> 12:24.613
LIKE IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

12:24.713 --> 12:25.864
AW, MAYBE
HE'S JUST BEING HUMBLE.

12:25.964 --> 12:27.949
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

12:28.049 --> 12:30.993
I KNOW IT. I KNOW HIM.

12:31.093 --> 12:33.453
THERE'S ALSO A SPELL
TO VANQUISH GHOSTS.

12:33.554 --> 12:36.163
IT SHOULD BE IN
THE BOOK SOMEWHERE.

12:36.263 --> 12:37.666
OH, YEAH.
IT'S IN HERE,
ALL RIGHT.

12:37.766 --> 12:38.917
THE ONLY
PROBLEM IS

12:39.017 --> 12:40.166
IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO BE
A GHOST YOURSELF

12:40.266 --> 12:41.267
TO SAY IT,
WHICH IS
FAIRLY LAME.

12:43.269 --> 12:43.687
UGH, NOT AGAIN.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.173
AH, NO.
NO. NO. NO.

12:48.273 --> 12:50.886
I DIDN'T SAVE...
ANY OF IT.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.970
I JUST LOST HALF
MY DOCUMENT.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.806
ALL RIGHT,
RELAX. I'LL CHECK
THE CIRCUIT BREAKER.

12:54.906 --> 12:57.224
[Phoebe] I REALLY NEED
TO GET MY OWN PLACE.

12:57.324 --> 12:59.283
SORRY?

13:00.284 --> 13:01.285
NOTHING.

13:05.372 --> 13:08.484
[RING]

13:08.584 --> 13:11.112
COLE TURNER'S OFFICE.

13:11.212 --> 13:12.822
HI. WHO'S THIS?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.031
I'M JULIE,
MR. TURNER'S NEW ASSISTANT.

13:14.131 --> 13:16.197
WHO'S THIS?

13:16.298 --> 13:17.241
I'M PHOEBE,
MR. TURNER'S NEW WIFE.

13:17.341 --> 13:21.095
OH, REALLY? I DIDN'T
REALIZE HE WAS MARRIED.

13:21.887 --> 13:25.666
YEAH, HE IS,
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

13:25.766 --> 13:27.709
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

13:27.810 --> 13:29.044
I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT IN HIS OFFICE.

13:29.144 --> 13:30.586
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

13:30.686 --> 13:31.796
NO. I'M SORRY,
YOU CAN'T.

13:31.896 --> 13:33.881
LOOK, HE SAID HE'D BE
IN THE OFFICE ALL DAY,

13:33.981 --> 13:35.632
AND I REALLY, REALLY
NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.801
RIGHT AWAY.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.736
HI, BABY.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.930
WHAT, DID YOU HIRE
YOUR NEW ASSISTANT

13:42.030 --> 13:44.057
ON THE SPOT?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.574
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
AT LEAST TOLD HER
YOU WERE MARRIED.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.519
LOOK, I HATE TO
BOTHER YOU, BUT, UM,

13:49.619 --> 13:53.122
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
THAT YOU COULD HELP ME.

13:53.623 --> 13:56.943
POWER'S BACK ON!

13:57.043 --> 13:58.627
[Phoebe]
WELL, I JUST CAN'T
GET ANY WORK DONE HERE,

14:00.796 --> 14:03.238
AND I AM <i>SO
</i> PUSHING MY DEADLINE.

14:03.338 --> 14:05.909
[IN COLE'S VOICE]
WHAT CAN I DO?

14:06.009 --> 14:07.493
I CAN'T GO TO
THE OFFICE, RIGHT?

14:07.593 --> 14:09.036
BECAUSE
THEY'RE PAINTING IT,
SO I WAS WONDERING IF--

14:09.136 --> 14:10.454
IF I KNEW OF A PLACE
YOU COULD WORK?

14:10.555 --> 14:12.246
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

14:12.346 --> 14:13.932
WHY DON'T
YOU MEET ME

14:15.642 --> 14:16.626
AT THE TOWERS
IN 20 MINUTES?

14:16.726 --> 14:18.461
UM, THE TOWERS WHERE
THE PARTY IS TONIGHT?

14:18.561 --> 14:21.254
YEAH, BUT
THAT'S TONIGHT.

14:21.354 --> 14:22.465
NOBODY'S
USING 'EM TODAY.

14:22.565 --> 14:23.841
OK.

14:23.941 --> 14:24.842
WHY NOT?
SOUNDS GOOD.

14:24.942 --> 14:26.426
[WHISPERING]
You're hired.

14:26.526 --> 14:27.694
[Phoebe] I'LL SEE YOU
THERE. THANKS.

14:27.903 --> 14:30.362
UH, CALL ME ON MY CELL
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

14:31.698 --> 14:33.364
OK? I GOTTA GO.

14:35.366 --> 14:38.812
NICE JOB WITH
THE LIGHTS, SIS.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.271
CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT KEEPS TRIPPING
THE BREAKER.

14:41.371 --> 14:43.608
MAYBE IT'S A GHOST.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.194
FOUND THIS IN THE FILE.

14:46.295 --> 14:47.456
THE GUY TO THE LEFT OF LEO,
DOES HE LOOK FAMILIAR?

14:47.466 --> 14:50.279
THAT'S OUR GHOST.
KILLED IN ACTION.

14:50.379 --> 14:53.033
HIS BROTHER'S
ON THE RIGHT.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.283
HE DIED
THE SAME DAY AS LEO.

14:55.383 --> 14:57.285
COULD BE A REUNION
HE WANTS TO AVOID HAVING.

14:57.385 --> 15:00.472
LEO!

15:01.432 --> 15:02.308
LEO?! I MEAN IT
THIS TIME.

15:05.185 --> 15:08.146
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

15:13.151 --> 15:16.301
NATHAN.

15:16.402 --> 15:18.303
YEAH, WE JUST MET HIM.
HE LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

15:18.403 --> 15:20.305
A LITTLE TRANSPARENT,

15:20.405 --> 15:21.401
BUT OTHERWISE
HE LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

15:21.411 --> 15:22.850
FOR A DEAD GUY.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.409
TALK TO ME.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.038
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

15:28.412 --> 15:30.081
HEY, WYATT!

15:30.414 --> 15:31.291
YOU'RE RIGHT,
LITTLE BROTHER.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.361
HE IS
THE SPITTING IMAGE
OF HIS GRANDFATHER.

15:35.461 --> 15:37.963
RICK, DON'T!

15:39.423 --> 15:43.218
RICK? HOW DID
HE KNOW YOUR NAME?

15:51.017 --> 15:54.186
LEO.

15:55.312 --> 15:56.063
I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:58.439 --> 15:59.757
RICK, LET'S GO.

15:59.857 --> 16:02.068
RICK, COME ON!
LET'S GO! COME ON!

16:08.447 --> 16:12.350
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'VE BEEN
HOLDING ON THIS LONG

16:12.450 --> 16:13.978
JUST TO HURT ME.

16:14.079 --> 16:15.353
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

16:15.453 --> 16:16.533
IS WHY THEY'RE NOT
TRANSPARENT ANYMORE.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.899
I MEAN, OTHER
THAN THE WALKING
THROUGH WALLS THING,

16:18.999 --> 16:21.358
THEY KIND OF SEEMED
NORMAL TO ME.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.360
THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING
CORPOREALIZING SO
THEY CAN MOVE THINGS.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.362
YEAH, LIKE
BUTCHER KNIVES.

16:26.462 --> 16:28.324
WELL, THEY'RE HOLDING ON
TO THEIR PAIN.

16:28.424 --> 16:30.243
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM
FROM MOVING ON.

16:30.343 --> 16:31.869
THEIR PAIN?

16:31.969 --> 16:33.661
LEO, THEY JUST
TRIED TO KILL YOU.

16:33.762 --> 16:35.538
YEAH. LUCKY
THEY'RE NOT DARKLIGHTERS,

16:35.638 --> 16:37.999
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN KILLED. AGAIN.

16:38.099 --> 16:41.375
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE WERE FRIENDS.

16:41.475 --> 16:43.477
WE GREW UP TOGETHER
DOWN IN BURLINGAME.

16:43.687 --> 16:47.299
I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH NATHAN.

16:47.399 --> 16:49.382
WHEN THE WAR CAME,
WE MADE A DEAL

16:49.482 --> 16:51.635
WITH OUR
RECRUITMENT OFFICER
THAT WE WOULD ENLIST

16:51.735 --> 16:54.805
AS LONG AS THEY KEPT US
IN THE SAME UNIT.

16:54.905 --> 16:57.099
YOU WERE CLOSE.

16:57.199 --> 16:59.391
YEAH.

16:59.491 --> 17:00.492
SO, UM, WHAT DO THEY
THINK YOU DID?

17:05.496 --> 17:09.500
WE'D JUST
GOT TRANSFERRED
ON TO THE ISLAND.

17:10.419 --> 17:12.502
WE GOT AMBUSHED
OUTSIDE THE AIRFIELD.

17:14.172 --> 17:17.590
HEAVY ARTILLERY.
MORTAR FIRE.

17:21.053 --> 17:22.430
THEY COULDN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE INJURIES,

17:24.763 --> 17:27.166
THE BODIES.

17:27.267 --> 17:30.518
THEN I HEARD
RICK'S VOICE.

17:30.644 --> 17:32.896
LEO! LEO!

17:35.690 --> 17:37.524
LEO! GET
OVER HERE QUICK!

17:39.318 --> 17:41.427
GET OVER HERE!
NATHAN'S BEEN HIT!

17:41.527 --> 17:44.407
STABILIZE HIS LEG!
GET HIM ON THE JEEP!
GO! GO! GO!

17:46.158 --> 17:47.367
IT'S BAD,
ISN'T IT?

17:49.534 --> 17:50.478
WHAT HIT HIM?

17:50.578 --> 17:51.854
MORTAR FRAG.
THEY HIT US WITH
HEAVY ARTILLERY.

17:51.954 --> 17:53.981
OUT OF NOWHERE.
THE WHOLE
BATTALION'S DOWN.

17:54.081 --> 17:55.523
[EXPLOSION]

17:55.623 --> 17:58.335
WE GOTTA GET HIM INSIDE.

18:02.545 --> 18:05.699
MEDICAL TENT!

18:05.799 --> 18:06.992
GET SOME SULFA POWDER!

18:07.092 --> 18:09.451
WE GOTTA
STOP THE BLEEDING.
HE'S GOING INTO SHOCK.

18:09.552 --> 18:11.872
HOW MANY SOLDIERS
DOWN OUT THERE?

18:11.972 --> 18:13.748
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY HIT US SO HARD.

18:13.848 --> 18:15.166
MAYBE 15 OR 20.
I DON'T KNOW.

18:15.266 --> 18:16.668
I NEED A MORPHINE KIT.

18:16.768 --> 18:18.378
YOU GOTTA HELP HIM.
LEO, HE NEEDS YOU.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.461
WE BOTH NEED YOU.

18:20.561 --> 18:21.462
IS THERE A MEDIC
OUT IN THE FIELD?

18:21.562 --> 18:22.547
I DON'T KNOW!
I DON'T KNOW!

18:22.647 --> 18:24.800
WILKINSON,
TRY AND STABILIZE HIM.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.235
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:28.195 --> 18:29.262
I'M GONNA HELP
THOSE MEN IN THE FIELD.

18:29.362 --> 18:30.470
WHAT?
WILKINSON WILL
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

18:30.570 --> 18:31.889
NO! NO! YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIM.

18:31.989 --> 18:33.349
THAT'S NATHAN
ON THAT BED!

18:33.449 --> 18:34.473
WELL, THERE'S MEN
DYING IN THAT FIELD

18:34.573 --> 18:35.474
AND NOBODY
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

18:35.574 --> 18:36.476
YOU'RE GONNA
CHOOSE THEM OVER US?!

18:36.576 --> 18:37.827
I'M SORRY.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.246
WYATT!

18:41.998 --> 18:43.732
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS!

18:43.832 --> 18:45.209
NATHAN'S GONNA DIE!
DON'T LET HIM DIE!
WYATT!

19:09.105 --> 19:12.549
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED.

19:12.649 --> 19:14.067
I SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO SAVE NATHAN AND
GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

19:18.611 --> 19:19.613
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
ALL DIED IN THE TENT.

19:22.950 --> 19:25.494
AND ALL THE GUYS
IN THE FIELD
THAT YOU DID SAVE

19:26.828 --> 19:29.914
WOULD HAVE DIED, TOO.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

19:31.415 --> 19:33.167
AND LEO...
FOR GOD'S SAKES,

19:34.835 --> 19:37.070
YOU WERE AWARDED
THE MEDAL OF HONOR.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.529
POSTHUMOUSLY,
I MIGHT ADD.

19:38.629 --> 19:40.323
I DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

19:40.423 --> 19:41.882
RIGHT. SO, I SUPPOSE

19:43.634 --> 19:47.413
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE
TO BE A WHITELIGHTER

19:47.513 --> 19:49.538
FOR SACRIFICING
YOUR LIFE
TO SAVE OTHERS.

19:49.638 --> 19:52.625
WERE THOSE LIVES
ANY MORE IMPORTANT...

19:52.725 --> 19:55.669
THAN NATHAN'S OR RICK'S?

19:55.770 --> 19:58.546
OR ANYONE ELSE IN THAT TENT?

19:58.646 --> 20:01.300
YOU KNOW, A GOOD FRIEND

20:01.400 --> 20:02.649
PUT HIS LIFE IN MY HANDS...

20:03.110 --> 20:06.553
AND I LEFT HIM TO DIE.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.447
ALL THE GOOD THAT
I'VE DONE SINCE THEN
CAN'T ERASE THAT FACT.

20:09.699 --> 20:13.559
MAYBE I DIDN'T DESERVE
TO BECOME A WHITELIGHTER.

20:13.659 --> 20:16.396
HEY, NEWS FLASH.
FRIENDS DON'T
KILL EACH OTHER, OK?

20:16.496 --> 20:18.857
I SAY WE DOUSE
THEIR DUSTY BONES

20:18.957 --> 20:21.566
WITH
OUR MAGIC POTION

20:21.666 --> 20:22.567
AND VANQUISH
THEIR SORRY ASSES.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.320
NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.570
THEY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

20:26.670 --> 20:27.697
OK, SO WHAT
DO YOU SUGGEST?

20:27.797 --> 20:30.283
IF I COULD TALK TO THEM,

20:30.383 --> 20:32.093
MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
WHY I DID WHAT I DID...

20:32.675 --> 20:35.180
THEN MAYBE
THEY COULD MOVE ON.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.581
MAYBE YOU ALL CAN.

20:38.681 --> 20:39.933
WE NEED
TO FIND WHERE
THEY WERE BURIED

20:41.683 --> 20:43.128
SO WE CAN
SUMMON THEM

20:43.228 --> 20:45.213
BEFORE THEY TRY TO
HURT ANYBODY ELSE.

20:45.313 --> 20:47.588
YEAH. LIKE US.

20:47.688 --> 20:49.483
A WHITELIGHTER. I
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

20:51.277 --> 20:53.513
THEY MADE HIM
A FRICKIN' ANGEL.

20:53.613 --> 20:55.222
I MEAN, HOW CAN
THEY REWARD HIM

20:55.322 --> 20:56.348
FOR TURNING HIS BACK
ON HIS FRIENDS?

20:56.448 --> 20:57.865
YEAH. BUT DID YOU SEE
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE
WHEN HE SAW US?

20:59.116 --> 21:02.228
GUILT.

21:02.328 --> 21:03.395
TOTAL GUILT.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.231
AT LEAST HE KNOWS
HE'S LIVING A LIE
BUILT ON OUR CORPSES.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.707
SO WHAT? WHO CARES?
I STILL WANT HIM DEAD.

21:12.794 --> 21:16.448
WE CAN'T KILL
A WHITELIGHTER.

21:16.548 --> 21:18.675
MAYBE NOT,
BUT WE CAN HURT HIM

21:20.636 --> 21:24.096
BY TAKING
THE THINGS THAT...

21:24.721 --> 21:26.848
HE HOLDS DEAR.

21:29.142 --> 21:29.726
MAKE HIM DREAD
HIS ETERNAL LIFE.

21:33.021 --> 21:36.383
WE CAN PUNISH HIM.

21:36.483 --> 21:38.134
MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE
THE FRAUD HE IS,

21:38.234 --> 21:39.844
BY KILLING
THOSE HE LOVES.

21:39.944 --> 21:42.196
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE THEN WE WILL
BE ABLE TO KILL HIM.

21:48.952 --> 21:52.455
PAYBACK IS A WITCH.

22:01.837 --> 22:05.591
WHOA! ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

22:07.426 --> 22:09.302
THE FIRM
LEASES IT FOR
PARTIES, RETREATS,

22:11.179 --> 22:13.873
SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
I THINK YOU QUALIFY.

22:13.973 --> 22:16.141
IT'S SO BIG
AND BEAUTIFUL.

22:16.766 --> 22:19.711
AND BIG.

22:19.811 --> 22:21.397
WAIT. LISTEN.

22:22.731 --> 22:25.383
I DON'T
HEAR ANYTHING.

22:25.483 --> 22:27.218
EXACTLY.

22:27.318 --> 22:30.345
THE CATERERS
AREN'T COMING TILL 4:00,
SO YOU CAN USE IT TILL THEN.

22:30.445 --> 22:33.098
AND YOU'RE SURE
YOU WON'T GET
IN TROUBLE?

22:33.198 --> 22:35.575
I'M ALREADY IN TROUBLE.
I'M IN LOVE.

22:38.035 --> 22:38.911
UM, I HAVE TO
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

22:41.787 --> 22:45.150
WERE YOU SERIOUS
THIS MORNING

22:45.250 --> 22:47.110
WHEN YOU SUGGESTED
THAT WE GET A PLACE
OF OUR OWN TOGETHER?

22:47.210 --> 22:49.571
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:49.671 --> 22:50.572
I DON'T KNOW.

22:50.672 --> 22:51.947
WRENCHING A HALLIWELL
AWAY FROM THE MANOR,

22:52.047 --> 22:53.866
IT'S NEVER
BEEN DONE BEFORE.

22:53.966 --> 22:55.699
I LIKE A CHALLENGE.

22:55.799 --> 22:57.244
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T WANT TO.

22:57.344 --> 22:59.829
IT'S JUST...

22:59.929 --> 23:03.641
HOW DO I BREAK UP
THE POWER OF THREE?

23:06.059 --> 23:09.229
[CLEARS THROAT]

23:10.439 --> 23:14.050
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP LIVING TOGETHER
TO BE CHARMED.

23:14.150 --> 23:16.594
NOT ANYMORE.
THE SOURCE IS DEAD.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.388
LEO CAN ORB YOU BACK
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

23:19.488 --> 23:21.641
SO COULD PAIGE
FOR THAT MATTER.

23:21.741 --> 23:24.659
IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW,
THEN WHEN?

23:26.826 --> 23:27.287
PIPER'LL KILL ME.

23:30.205 --> 23:31.915
THE MANOR'S TOO CROWDED.

23:33.584 --> 23:36.194
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM.
HELL, THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH ELECTRICITY.

23:36.294 --> 23:39.197
OR PRIVACY.

23:39.297 --> 23:41.049
YOU JUST ENJOY
YOUR PEACE HERE TODAY.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.159
WE'LL TALK MORE
TONIGHT AT THE PARTY.

23:44.259 --> 23:46.912
OH, NO! THE PARTY.
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

23:47.012 --> 23:49.289
I DIDN'T BRING
ANYTHING TO WEAR.

23:49.389 --> 23:50.842
DON'T WORRY.
YOU JUST CONCENTRATE
ON YOUR ADVICE COLUMN.

23:50.852 --> 23:53.309
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.
I PROMISE.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.885
GOING DOWN?

24:04.985 --> 24:06.363
MY WIFE NEEDS A DRESS
FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.935
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.370
CLASSY, BUT TOO SAFE.
I WANT PHOEBE NOTICED.

24:19.872 --> 24:23.168
NOT THAT NOTICED.

24:25.045 --> 24:28.197
PERFECT.

24:28.298 --> 24:29.781
THANK YOU.

24:29.881 --> 24:31.242
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANNA SEE THAT
RED NUMBER AGAIN?

24:31.342 --> 24:33.260
JUST SAVE IT, OK?

24:34.345 --> 24:36.096
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
I'M A ONE-WOMAN DEMON.

24:36.555 --> 24:38.598
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

24:39.890 --> 24:42.435
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

24:50.024 --> 24:53.721
FOUND 'EM!
RICK AND NATHAN LANG.

24:53.821 --> 24:56.347
BURIED SEPTEMBER 22,
1942, AT THE LOCAL V.A.

24:56.447 --> 25:00.309
OK. WHERE'S THE BOOK?
WE NEED THE SUMMONING SPELL.

25:00.409 --> 25:02.352
ALREADY AHEAD OF YOU.
WHO YA GONNA CALL?

25:02.452 --> 25:05.021
CUTE. LET'S GO.

25:05.121 --> 25:06.956
WAIT. SOMETHING'S WRONG.

25:07.914 --> 25:09.815
IT'S MARIA, THE TEACHER.
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

25:09.916 --> 25:12.486
I HAVE TO GO TO HER.

25:12.586 --> 25:13.654
BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE GHOSTS?

25:13.754 --> 25:14.820
I THOUGHT
WE HAD TO FIND THEM

25:14.920 --> 25:15.821
BEFORE THEY HURT
SOMEONE ELSE.

25:15.921 --> 25:17.127
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO ONE OF MY CHARGES--

25:17.137 --> 25:18.616
NO. NO.
IT'S OK. UM, GO,

25:18.716 --> 25:20.618
AND JUST MEET US THERE
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

25:20.718 --> 25:22.887
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OK.

25:23.637 --> 25:24.555
LET'S GO.

25:27.931 --> 25:31.377
SHOULD WE WAIT
FOR THE SISTERS
TO SEPARATE?

25:31.477 --> 25:33.879
NO. WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEM LATER.

25:33.979 --> 25:35.838
WE'RE FOLLOWING WYATT.

25:35.938 --> 25:37.759
WYATT? WHY?

25:37.859 --> 25:39.902
BECAUSE NOTHING
PUSHES A WHITELIGHTER
OVER THE EDGE FASTER

25:41.111 --> 25:43.845
THAN LOSING A CHARGE.

25:43.945 --> 25:46.849
LET'S GO.

25:46.949 --> 25:48.325
I TOLD YOU, LADY.
I TOLD YOU.
DON'T SWEAT ME!

25:50.453 --> 25:51.952
EASY.
LEO.

25:53.789 --> 25:54.854
WHO ARE YOU?
THE BOYFRIEND?

25:54.955 --> 25:57.066
WELL, YOU COME
JUST IN TIME
TO SEE THE SHOW.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.109
SIT DOWN,
CLOWN, THERE'S
A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.861
LISTEN, JUST
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN,

26:01.961 --> 26:03.530
AND WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THIS.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.963
YOU WANNA TALK, CHUMP?

26:05.964 --> 26:06.865
GREG, DON'T.

26:06.965 --> 26:07.866
YOU DISSED ME, TEACH.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.535
GOT ME IN A WHOLE LOT
OF TROUBLE HERE.

26:09.635 --> 26:10.620
NOW SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA PAY.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.663
DON'T BE AFRAID...

26:12.763 --> 26:14.373
TEACH.

26:14.473 --> 26:15.873
SHUT UP. SHUT UP.
YOU'RE THE ONE

26:15.973 --> 26:17.751
WHO SHOULD BE AFRAID
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

26:17.851 --> 26:18.876
STOP IT, GREG.
DON'T BE STUPID.

26:18.976 --> 26:20.504
STUPID?
IS THAT WHAT I AM?

26:20.604 --> 26:22.254
IF YOU HURT HIM,
YOU WILL BE.

26:22.354 --> 26:23.923
IT'LL BE THE STUPIDEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE,

26:24.023 --> 26:25.508
AND THERE WON'T BE
ANY COMING BACK FROM IT.

26:25.608 --> 26:27.385
YOUR LIFE WILL BE OVER.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.135
MY LIFE'S ALREADY OVER!

26:29.235 --> 26:30.679
NO, IT'S NOT. NOT YET.

26:30.779 --> 26:32.025
IT TAKES MORE COURAGE
TO PUT DOWN THAT KNIFE

26:32.035 --> 26:34.824
THAN TO USE IT.
BELIEVE ME.

26:38.076 --> 26:41.663
GIVE ME THE KNIFE, GREG.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.666
YOU'LL CALL THE POLICE.

26:45.666 --> 26:47.293
NO, I WON'T.

26:54.883 --> 26:57.993
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:58.093 --> 26:59.911
YEAH, I THINK SO.

27:00.011 --> 27:01.914
YOU DID A GOOD JOB
TEACHING HIM
A LESSON.

27:02.014 --> 27:04.014
THANKS TO YOU.

27:05.141 --> 27:06.376
WHAT DID I DO?

27:06.477 --> 27:08.018
HELPED ME REMEMBER WHY
I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER.

27:09.646 --> 27:10.772
NO! MARIA!

27:18.529 --> 27:22.181
YOU WATCH HER DIE
LIKE YOU WATCHED US DIE.

27:22.281 --> 27:25.017
NO!

27:25.117 --> 27:26.827
MARIA!
NO!

27:28.035 --> 27:31.581
LET GO!
DON'T!
FIGHT IT!

27:32.582 --> 27:36.210
[Nathan]
HER BLOOD IS
ON YOUR HANDS.

27:37.796 --> 27:41.046
MARIA.

27:44.384 --> 27:47.454
WHY?

27:47.554 --> 27:49.539
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
SHE WAS INNOCENT!

27:49.639 --> 27:52.016
SO WERE WE!

27:59.606 --> 28:03.134
OK, YOU GO GET THE
VANQUISHING SPELL,

28:03.234 --> 28:05.595
AND I'LL GET--LEO!

28:05.695 --> 28:07.345
UH, DON'T YOU
MEAN POTION?

28:07.445 --> 28:09.306
REMEMBER, THE SPELL
ONLY WORKS IF YOU'RE DEAD.

28:09.406 --> 28:11.973
RIGHT. SPELL,
POTION, WHATEVER.

28:12.073 --> 28:14.059
LEO?!

28:14.159 --> 28:16.187
SO, DOES THAT MEAN
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED

28:16.287 --> 28:18.522
IN HELPING THEM
MOVE ON?

28:18.622 --> 28:19.773
TO HELL, MAYBE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DESERVE.

28:19.873 --> 28:21.983
WE WENT TO THE V.A.
TO HELP MISGUIDED GHOSTS,
NOT KILLER GHOSTS.

28:22.083 --> 28:25.295
WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE THAT THEY
KILLED THAT GUARD.

28:26.045 --> 28:28.130
VANQUISHING POTION.
I'M ALL OVER IT.

28:29.674 --> 28:31.408
[CLEARS THROAT]

28:31.508 --> 28:33.092
PHOEBE.

28:34.092 --> 28:35.214
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DON'T YOU
RECOGNIZE ME?

28:35.224 --> 28:37.706
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:37.806 --> 28:38.874
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

28:38.974 --> 28:40.041
OH, THANK YOU.

28:40.141 --> 28:41.999
WOW. COLE IS KIND OF
SPLURGING LATELY, HUH?

28:42.099 --> 28:44.879
YEAH. AND I AM
NOT COMPLAINING.

28:44.979 --> 28:46.796
I ENJOY
BEING THE BELLE
OF THE BALL.

28:46.896 --> 28:49.299
WELL, SORRY, CINDERELLA,
BUT THE BALL'S BEEN CANCELED.

28:49.399 --> 28:52.861
WE HAVE KILLER GHOSTS.

28:53.109 --> 28:54.194
YOU'RE KIDDING.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.073
YOU ARE NOT KIDDING.

28:59.157 --> 29:00.533
OK. WELL, IS IT
POSSIBLE THAT YOU
GUYS COULD MAYBE...

29:02.577 --> 29:06.020
HANDLE THIS
WITHOUT ME?

29:06.120 --> 29:07.857
PHOEBE, THEY TRIED
TO KILL LEO.

29:07.957 --> 29:09.066
WHAT?

29:09.166 --> 29:10.626
GRUDGE FROM THE PAST.
I'LL GO DO THE POTION.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.487
OK.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.029
AND I WILL CALL COLE
AND TELL HIM "NO"
TO THE PARTY.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.575
GUESS I COULD
TELL HIM NO
FOR EVERYTHING.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.828
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:22.928 --> 29:25.388
NOTHING. NOTHING.

29:30.559 --> 29:34.087
COLE WANTS US
TO GET OUR OWN PLACE.

29:34.187 --> 29:36.297
WHAT, YOU MEAN
MOVE OUT?

29:36.397 --> 29:38.148
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
LIKE NORMAL
MARRIED COUPLES DO.

29:38.816 --> 29:42.011
WE DIDN'T.

29:42.111 --> 29:43.052
YEAH, BUT
YOU'RE NOT NORMAL.

29:43.152 --> 29:45.114
NEITHER ARE YOU.

29:46.323 --> 29:50.058
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT ABOUT THIS,

29:50.158 --> 29:51.770
BUT I JUST DON'T
LIKE THE FEELING
THAT SOMETIMES

29:51.870 --> 29:54.022
I HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN MY SISTERS
AND MY HUSBAND.

29:54.122 --> 29:56.147
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

29:56.248 --> 29:58.500
HOW LONG ARE WE
ALL GONNA STAY HERE?

29:59.752 --> 30:01.945
YOU KNOW,
ANOTHER YEAR?

30:02.046 --> 30:03.196
ANOTHER 5 YEARS?
ANOTHER 50 YEARS?

30:03.296 --> 30:06.407
AT WHAT POINT
DO WE MOVE ON
WITH OUR LIVES

30:06.507 --> 30:08.425
AND NOT LET
EVIL DICTATE THEM?

30:09.094 --> 30:10.302
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.179
GO TO YOUR PARTY.
WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE GHOSTS.

30:15.431 --> 30:16.683
YOU HATE ME
RIGHT NOW.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.084
NO, I DON'T.

30:20.184 --> 30:21.587
YES, SHE DOES.

30:21.688 --> 30:23.047
LOOK, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

30:23.147 --> 30:25.966
RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED TO GO
TAKE CARE OF YOUR MAN,

30:26.066 --> 30:28.191
AND I NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF MINE.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.904
WE DON'T NEED THE POWER
OF THREE TO DO THIS.

30:37.118 --> 30:40.770
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU,

30:40.870 --> 30:43.372
SEEING AS HOW YOU
PRACTICALLY FORCED ME
TO MOVE IN HERE.

30:46.207 --> 30:46.959
WHERE'S LEO?

30:49.461 --> 30:50.921
I ALREADY CALLED
FOR HIM TWICE.

30:51.922 --> 30:54.198
LEO!

30:54.298 --> 30:55.383
YOU'RE
HALF-WHITELIGHTER.

30:56.968 --> 30:58.117
SEE IF
YOU CAN SENSE HIM.

30:58.217 --> 30:59.213
SENSE HIM? I'VE
NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.

30:59.223 --> 31:01.888
WELL, TRY NOW.

31:06.517 --> 31:10.087
I THINK HE'S IN TROUBLE.

31:10.188 --> 31:11.564
WELL, GO FIND HIM. NOW!

31:28.036 --> 31:31.106
LEO.

31:31.206 --> 31:32.331
I TRIED TO STOP THEM,
BUT I COULDN'T.

31:34.291 --> 31:36.418
OH.

31:37.461 --> 31:39.153
OK, COME ON.

31:39.253 --> 31:40.489
COME ON. LET'S
GET UP. LET'S
GO OVER HERE.

31:40.589 --> 31:43.299
THAT'S IT.

31:48.261 --> 31:51.373
OK, WHAT HAPPENED?

31:51.473 --> 31:53.265
THEY'RE
GETTING EVEN WITH ME.

31:55.267 --> 31:57.461
THEY KILLED HER
BECAUSE OF ME.

31:57.562 --> 31:59.588
WHO?

31:59.688 --> 32:01.173
RICK AND NATHAN?

32:01.273 --> 32:06.360
BECAUSE I LEFT THEM TO DIE,
THEY'RE MAKING ME PAY.

32:09.239 --> 32:12.700
COME ON,
LET'S GET YOU HOME.

32:15.284 --> 32:18.997
I DON'T HAVE
MY POWERS ANYMORE.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.289
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:22.708 --> 32:23.834
I CAN'T ORB OR HEAL.

32:24.585 --> 32:26.253
BUT HOW?

32:27.838 --> 32:29.196
DOESN'T MATTER.

32:29.296 --> 32:30.757
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
GIVEN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.201
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.931
YOUR POWERS
MUST BE TIED TO
YOUR EMOTIONS LIKE OURS.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.792
THAT MEANS
YOU CAN GET THEM BACK.

32:41.892 --> 32:44.837
YOU JUST HAVE
TO PICK YOURSELF UP.

32:44.937 --> 32:48.047
DON'T LET THEM
DEFEAT YOU.

32:48.147 --> 32:49.482
YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

32:49.649 --> 32:52.944
AREN'T I?

32:53.360 --> 32:54.318
THEY'RE GHOSTS
BECAUSE OF ME.

32:58.321 --> 32:59.908
THEIR RAGE COMES
FROM SOMETHING THAT I DID.

33:03.619 --> 33:05.327
IF I CAN JUST
GIVE MYSELF TO THEM--

33:07.329 --> 33:09.150
THEY'D KILL YOU.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.332
BECAUSE
WITHOUT YOUR POWERS,
YOU'RE DEFENSELESS,

33:12.043 --> 33:15.336
LIKE A...MORTAL.

33:20.092 --> 33:23.411
OK, WE GOTTA
GET YOU HOME.

33:23.511 --> 33:25.621
NO!

33:25.721 --> 33:28.099
NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA DIE
BECAUSE OF ME!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

33:30.184 --> 33:32.102
THESE ARE MY DEMONS!
NOT YOURS!

33:36.857 --> 33:40.301
OK. JUST--JUST
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

33:40.401 --> 33:44.345
I'M GONNA GO,
AND I'M GONNA GET
PHOEBE AND PIPER.

33:44.445 --> 33:47.891
I WILL BE
RIGHT BACK.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.492
I PROMISE.
DON'T LEAVE.

33:59.001 --> 34:02.403
DEFENSELESS
AS A MORTAL, HUH?

34:02.503 --> 34:05.279
WE GOT HIM
RIGHT WHERE WE WANT HIM.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.033
I DON'T KNOW, RICK.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.659
YOU DON'T KNOW?

34:09.759 --> 34:11.379
AFTER WAITING ALL THIS TIME,
YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?

34:11.389 --> 34:13.163
NO.
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

34:13.263 --> 34:15.331
DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE IT'S ENOUGH
JUST KILLING HIM.

34:15.431 --> 34:17.917
I WANT HIM
TO SUFFER FIRST.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.518
FOLLOW ME.

34:26.815 --> 34:30.302
PENNY FOR YOUR
THOUGHTS, COUNSELOR?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.905
JUST THAT I HOPE
