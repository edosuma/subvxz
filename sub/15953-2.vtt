00:37.294 --> 00:39.494
- You guys ready for this?

00:45.969 --> 00:47.769
I wanna introduce you
to Sergeant Furry,

00:47.838 --> 00:48.970
she's gonna be helping us,

00:49.073 --> 00:51.606
she's gonna be the one
taking you into jail today.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.642
I bet you know the
Sheriff's office,

00:53.744 --> 00:56.178
and we trust her
on this project.

00:56.246 --> 00:58.880
- In phase one we brought
participants in individually.

00:58.982 --> 01:01.716
It's hard to sneak
people into jail,

01:01.819 --> 01:03.351
so we've learned in Phase Two,

01:03.454 --> 01:05.654
we're gonna bring
people in in groups.

01:05.789 --> 01:08.156
- Remember, after you pull out
of this car and go to jail,

01:08.258 --> 01:10.192
I don't know you,
you don't know me.

01:10.294 --> 01:10.992
- Thank you.

01:11.128 --> 01:13.795
- Here's your stuff and yours.

01:13.931 --> 01:15.697
- We'll get you guys
changes up back here

01:15.799 --> 01:19.034
and when you come out
you'll be inmates.

01:28.745 --> 01:30.045
Alright you have any jewellery
on you or anything?

01:30.147 --> 01:30.879
- No.

01:30.981 --> 01:32.013
- Watches or nothing like that?

01:32.116 --> 01:34.116
Alright, you guys ready?

01:47.464 --> 01:48.964
- We're bringing them
in under the assumption

01:49.099 --> 01:51.566
that from another county
transfer to mix the cover

01:51.702 --> 01:55.036
stories up and it just helps us
get them in easier.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.082
- Alright.

02:21.732 --> 02:23.899
(shouting)

02:26.103 --> 02:28.270
(buzzing)

02:37.614 --> 02:39.381
- I'm gonna (beep) 'em.

02:39.483 --> 02:41.683
I ain't the one, (beep)
him, (beep) trying to

02:41.785 --> 02:45.921
talk to me like that, I'm
gonna flood this (beep).

02:52.829 --> 02:56.064
- I'm Sheri, I'm 39,
I'm from the northwest.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.100
I'm a mom of three, and I
was a correction officer

02:59.269 --> 03:02.737
in a maximum prison, and
I had to step away from it

03:02.873 --> 03:06.508
when Dustin got deployed
for almost 13 months.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.944
Now my husband's back
from Afghanistan,

03:09.046 --> 03:11.246
and I'm ready to go
back to work, it's time,

03:11.348 --> 03:12.881
it's my time now.

03:12.983 --> 03:15.584
But once you've left
corrections, and it's been more

03:15.686 --> 03:18.253
than a year, you're no
longer just allowed to apply

03:18.355 --> 03:20.722
and get in, so I'm hoping
being in this program,

03:20.824 --> 03:24.159
being a part of it will
get me back into the field,

03:24.294 --> 03:26.695
it'll show myself that I'm
ready to do this again

03:26.797 --> 03:29.764
and no one else in America
is gonna be able to

03:29.866 --> 03:33.235
they're a correction
officer and was an inmate.

03:33.337 --> 03:36.438
(shouting, screaming)

03:50.187 --> 03:52.687
- If you could just
sign in right here.

03:52.789 --> 03:56.424
Sir would you step
right here with me.

03:56.526 --> 03:58.393
Stand right here.

03:58.495 --> 04:00.161
What's your last name?

04:00.297 --> 04:01.529
- Ryan.

04:02.332 --> 04:05.033
- My name is Ryan, I'm 27 years
old, and I'm from Kentucky.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.335
I joined the US army
specifically the army reserves

04:07.437 --> 04:09.871
at 19 as a active duty.

04:10.007 --> 04:13.475
Got good training, learned
a lot about being a medic.

04:13.577 --> 04:17.646
Overall I'm a very logical,
rational, systematic person.

04:17.748 --> 04:20.015
I'm always thinking about
things that most people

04:20.117 --> 04:22.217
couldn't wrap their minds
around even if they tried to,

04:22.319 --> 04:23.918
studied for years.

04:24.054 --> 04:25.320
- First name.

04:25.455 --> 04:26.288
- Kyle.

04:26.456 --> 04:27.489
- How tall are you?

04:27.658 --> 04:28.723
- Five seven.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.360
(shouting)

04:40.337 --> 04:41.503
- Alright man, follow me.

04:41.605 --> 04:43.238
This way, right over there.

04:43.373 --> 04:46.141
- I'm feeling, there's a
little bit of anticipation,

04:46.310 --> 04:49.010
mostly for what
I don't know yet.

04:52.649 --> 04:55.317
There are people weaker than
me, mentally and physically

04:55.452 --> 04:58.853
who've made it and I
will I will prevail as well.

05:04.728 --> 05:06.294
(shouting)

05:06.430 --> 05:09.397
- I think I'm in shock of
how this whole process is,

05:09.566 --> 05:11.800
the only way I can describe
it is like you watch

05:11.968 --> 05:15.036
horror movies where
people, they're possessed.

05:15.205 --> 05:17.405
(shouting)

05:20.210 --> 05:21.743
And I just freaked out.

05:21.878 --> 05:23.945
It became so sad so quick.

05:28.685 --> 05:29.751
- Right here.

05:31.221 --> 05:35.023
- I feel very weak and like
just out of my element.

05:39.930 --> 05:42.197
(screaming)

05:43.400 --> 05:47.068
- Stand right there
where it's open okay?

05:47.137 --> 05:50.105
- I'm most concerned
about giving up control.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.840
I've never had to
do that before.

05:51.975 --> 05:54.542
I'm the officer, I'm the
mom, I run the show at home.

05:54.644 --> 05:56.444
There was always that
question in my mind

05:56.546 --> 06:00.782
as a corrections officer
of, what's it like for them?

06:00.917 --> 06:04.085
I literally have
become just an inmate.

06:14.698 --> 06:17.432
- They don't know that there's
any other participants so,

06:17.567 --> 06:18.967
as far as they're
concerned, they're the only

06:19.102 --> 06:21.269
two people going in, so,
we gotta maintain that

06:21.438 --> 06:23.405
throughout this process.

06:27.144 --> 06:29.778
- Chief Deputy Brad Jones has
been here for about 15 years

06:29.946 --> 06:32.280
in his role as a
number two person

06:32.416 --> 06:33.882
here at the Sheriff's office.

06:34.017 --> 06:35.950
- Chief Jones' gonna bring
in Monalisa and Quintin

06:36.052 --> 06:38.119
under the assumption they
were stopped on the interstate

06:38.288 --> 06:40.522
for out-of-state crimes.

06:40.624 --> 06:41.523
- [Jones] Are you guys ready?

06:41.658 --> 06:42.791
- Ready.

06:43.627 --> 06:46.461
- My name is Quintin, I'm
a retired state policeman,

06:46.630 --> 06:48.830
bounty hunter,
private investigator.

06:48.965 --> 06:50.932
It's extremely important
for me to do this,

06:51.067 --> 06:54.135
because I'm curious to learn
what it's for all the people

06:54.271 --> 06:56.905
that I've brought into
the system, I've arrested.

06:57.007 --> 07:01.476
Probably about a thousand
people in my career.

07:01.578 --> 07:02.911
It's a long career.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.078
- [Jones] How're you feeling?

07:04.147 --> 07:07.849
- I don't have any words
right now, I just, whoa.

07:07.984 --> 07:09.350
I'm ready.

07:09.486 --> 07:12.020
I'm Monalisa and I am
about to go to jail

07:12.122 --> 07:16.191
and quite frankly
I'm scared as (beep).

07:17.294 --> 07:18.660
- [Jones] You ever think
you'd sign up to go to jail?

07:18.829 --> 07:20.228
- No, not at all.

07:22.032 --> 07:23.865
And when I see those
lights and I see you two,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.069
I get creeped out, okay, this
doesn't even feel good at all.

07:28.905 --> 07:30.572
I know you got a smile on
your face and you're nice,

07:30.707 --> 07:31.973
but I kind of feel
creepy, you know?

07:32.108 --> 07:32.974
- Why's that?

07:33.076 --> 07:34.008
- I don't know,

07:34.110 --> 07:34.809
cops make me creepy.
- Some people don't

07:34.978 --> 07:35.977
like the police.

07:36.079 --> 07:37.712
- They make me feel creeped out.

07:37.781 --> 07:40.281
I used to believe
in law enforcement,

07:40.383 --> 07:44.118
I used to really think
that they did their jobs,

07:44.221 --> 07:47.555
but after my daughter went
through her experience

07:47.657 --> 07:51.693
I don't really have the respect
I used to have for them.

07:59.669 --> 08:01.469
She was on the dean's
list when she got arrested

08:01.605 --> 08:05.139
for God's sake, and now
she's a caged animal.

08:05.242 --> 08:09.811
They don't think of her as
anything else but a criminal.

08:09.980 --> 08:12.947
It's like it's like your breath
has been taken away,

08:13.049 --> 08:14.949
it's like you can't
breathe anymore, you can't

08:15.085 --> 08:18.419
think, you can't
focus, you can't

08:18.522 --> 08:19.988
you just can't be.

08:20.123 --> 08:22.891
I feel like this is a personal
journey that I have to take

08:23.026 --> 08:27.061
because my life depends on
it, I am so broken emotionally

08:30.734 --> 08:33.902
from losing my
daughter, I just wanna,

08:34.804 --> 08:37.572
I just need to
understand, it's too much,

08:37.707 --> 08:41.743
that goes on in my head, that
I want to bring to closure.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.044
- We got two pair of
handcuffs for you so--

08:43.179 --> 08:44.612
- Oh, (beep) it's time.

08:44.748 --> 08:46.047
- Yeah it's time.

08:46.182 --> 08:48.216
- Alright put this hand right
here.

08:49.553 --> 08:50.919
- The thing about what
people feel about police

08:51.054 --> 08:53.521
is very circumstance-related.

08:53.623 --> 08:56.224
If their house is broken
into, they love us.

08:56.359 --> 09:00.061
If their children are
arrested, they hate us.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.437
(car starting)

09:09.539 --> 09:12.574
- When I think about her,
I got my fingers crossed

09:12.709 --> 09:15.677
and I'm praying that
nothing happens to her while

09:15.812 --> 09:20.348
I'm in here, because
ultimately this is for her.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.250
And this is for the
people who need to see

09:22.385 --> 09:24.285
a change in the system.

09:32.128 --> 09:34.028
- Trespass,
theft, theft, glove six

09:34.130 --> 09:36.331
validate your bonds,

09:36.466 --> 09:38.566
is not bond, Judge Nuever.

09:39.469 --> 09:40.168
- Pregnant?

09:40.270 --> 09:41.336
- No.

09:41.371 --> 09:42.403
- Feeling suicidal or
thinking of hurting yourself

09:42.539 --> 09:43.237
or anyone else?

09:43.340 --> 09:44.539
- No, just nervous.

09:44.608 --> 09:45.974
- Okay, it's okay, you have
any scars, marks or tattoos?

09:46.142 --> 09:46.808
- No.

09:46.977 --> 09:47.942
- That's it.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.426
- When inmates first come in,
after the booking process,

10:05.528 --> 10:09.297
the first place they go
is the classification.

10:20.276 --> 10:22.377
After meeting Ryan, I'm
a little worried for him.

10:22.545 --> 10:24.178
He's obviously
highly intelligent,

10:24.314 --> 10:26.848
but he's gonna come off
as kind of condescending

10:26.950 --> 10:29.784
to other inmates, maybe
a little arrogant.

10:29.919 --> 10:32.120
I hope Ryan listens to the
training that we provided for

10:32.222 --> 10:34.956
him goes in, does what he's
told and comes back out

10:35.091 --> 10:36.991
and gives us
valuable information.

10:37.093 --> 10:39.427
(chuckling)

10:52.342 --> 10:54.909
- I thought it would be good
to have my last name be Ryan

10:55.045 --> 10:58.212
so I would answer to it,
so then Kyle Ryan sounded

10:58.381 --> 11:00.882
very simple and I'll
just tell people that my

11:01.017 --> 11:03.251
friends call me Ryan.

11:03.353 --> 11:05.319
It will be interesting
to see how much of myself

11:05.422 --> 11:09.557
truly changes rather than the
image that I'm putting on.

11:14.164 --> 11:16.564
(slow music)

11:29.212 --> 11:31.446
(chatting)

11:50.166 --> 11:52.567
- When I went up there to
the classification pod,

11:52.736 --> 11:56.337
I sit underneath the stairs
because you see people

11:56.439 --> 11:58.840
coming from in front of
you and to the left of you

11:58.942 --> 12:02.210
and you're less likely
to get ambushed.

12:04.881 --> 12:08.883
The real strategy is to
become one of the crowd.

12:13.690 --> 12:16.023
The strange thing about
jail is that it is stranger

12:16.159 --> 12:17.725
than I though it was gonna be.

12:17.827 --> 12:20.394
It's like an odd summer camp
for people who don't fit into

12:20.497 --> 12:23.064
society, they are somebody here.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.633
(chatting)

12:25.735 --> 12:27.635
And out there they are not.

12:27.771 --> 12:30.204
(shouting)

12:30.340 --> 12:32.507
(beeping)

12:48.691 --> 12:51.826
(shouting, chatting)

13:12.782 --> 13:14.649
- As we're walking
towards classification,

13:14.784 --> 13:17.885
like it hits me that
I'm really in here.

13:17.987 --> 13:20.955
I didn't realize how
real it was gonna be.

13:21.090 --> 13:24.759
My mind was racing, I felt
like I was gonna throw up.

13:24.861 --> 13:25.693
- Name?

13:26.996 --> 13:29.197
Go ahead, what's your name?

13:50.820 --> 13:52.520
- When we get in there
and they close the door

13:52.622 --> 13:54.522
and we look around,
there's no guard and you're

13:54.657 --> 13:56.691
all by yourself with
all these people.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.860
Every training I've ever had
in my life went out the door.

13:58.995 --> 13:59.794
Excuse me.

14:01.631 --> 14:02.630
- Need help hon?

14:02.699 --> 14:06.500
- Yeah, this is my bed,
it's all jacked up girl.

14:07.871 --> 14:11.072
- This is not my sleep
number, grab your (beep)

14:11.241 --> 14:15.243
- It is the most wretched,
foul, dirty, disease-infested

14:16.846 --> 14:20.882
and it was not what I think
I expected it to be like.

14:22.952 --> 14:26.687
And it like hit me, you know I
don't think I can handle this.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.331
- Staples, I see you moving.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.533
(chatting)

15:01.124 --> 15:04.692
- I'm not scared, nervous
or worried at all.

15:08.197 --> 15:09.997
- Step up here please.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.974
- I understand where I'm putting
the people I incarcerate.

15:20.076 --> 15:22.643
What the lack of understanding
is is more how they

15:22.779 --> 15:25.913
feel about things,
is that I'm lacking.

15:28.084 --> 15:30.751
- Go have a seat,
DT1 over there.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.293
- It's a rare opportunity
to spend time in jail

15:39.395 --> 15:41.162
without being charged.

15:41.230 --> 15:44.398
Basically I'm a student of
corrections and I hope to learn

15:44.500 --> 15:48.703
the inner workings of the
facility from the inside.

15:48.838 --> 15:51.072
(shouting)

15:56.646 --> 15:58.612
- Have you ever been
in jail before mam?

15:58.681 --> 15:59.880
- No.

15:59.949 --> 16:01.315
- No so you've never been patted
down or anything like that?

16:01.451 --> 16:02.183
- No.

16:02.318 --> 16:04.785
- This is the worst part, okay?

16:04.887 --> 16:07.188
- This is a place where
I have no control.

16:07.323 --> 16:09.357
I can't understand anything.

16:09.492 --> 16:10.758
- Were gonna put you in
here, and what they'll do

16:10.860 --> 16:13.527
they're gonna call you out
fingerprint you, book you in.

16:13.629 --> 16:16.097
- CO's, they've been given
dominion over human life,

16:16.199 --> 16:18.332
and they do things
to these inmates that you know

16:18.468 --> 16:20.835
are just absolutely inhumane.

16:25.074 --> 16:29.110
- Mam, we don't do anything
in a hurry here, okay?

16:31.214 --> 16:33.447
- I'm very concerned
about what my experience

16:33.583 --> 16:35.983
is gonna be like with the CO's.

16:36.919 --> 16:39.687
I don't have any
respect for CO's.

16:39.822 --> 16:42.123
- I don't give a (beep) about
nothing of this (beep),

16:42.258 --> 16:43.657
you (beep) nothing to me.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.859
You ain't nothing to me.

16:44.961 --> 16:46.660
I don't give a (beep)
about none of it.

16:46.829 --> 16:49.163
- I don't even have no
respect for the system.

16:49.298 --> 16:51.432
(shouting)

16:53.202 --> 16:55.669
But I do know that's my enemy.

17:05.848 --> 17:07.448
- As a corrections
officer, I've had training

17:07.550 --> 17:10.251
on how to keep
people in, and now

17:10.353 --> 17:14.021
I'm on the other side and I
don't know how you prepare

17:14.123 --> 17:16.123
for something like that.

17:17.827 --> 17:21.862
I feel very weak and like just
exhausted and out of my element.

17:44.754 --> 17:48.923
- In Phase One F-Pod was made
up mostly of older inmates.

17:49.058 --> 17:52.793
This time around, F-Pod
is completely different.

17:52.929 --> 17:55.629
They're a younger, volatile
and a more unpredictable group.

17:55.765 --> 17:57.098
(laughing)

17:57.233 --> 18:01.869
- This is my home-away-from-home
I guess you can say now.

18:01.971 --> 18:03.337
- We got all these new
girls and they're all young

18:03.439 --> 18:07.274
and loud and rude. (laughing)

18:09.078 --> 18:10.144
- Right here.

18:12.215 --> 18:13.514
- I don't know.

18:15.051 --> 18:16.517
- Sarah, hurry up.

18:46.282 --> 18:48.382
- Raymond, Sheri, Raymond.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.951
- Sharia Raymond.

18:51.921 --> 18:56.490
- Walking into F-Pod and all
you can see is just girls,

18:56.592 --> 18:58.125
and it seems like there's
a hundred of them,

18:58.227 --> 18:59.727
and they're just staring at you.

18:59.795 --> 19:03.864
You can tell that they're
watching every move you make.

19:10.573 --> 19:13.841
- When you go in, try to at
all cost, get a bottom cell.

19:13.943 --> 19:15.943
We've got a lot better
coverage on you.

19:16.012 --> 19:18.112
Do whatever you can without
drawing too much attention

19:18.247 --> 19:20.848
on you, to get in a bottom tier.

19:26.389 --> 19:28.322
- In the back of my head I can
remember getting my training

19:28.457 --> 19:31.091
and the Captain's like, "You
need to be on the bottom floor"

19:31.227 --> 19:33.994
Okay, well you're not in
there and I've got women

19:34.096 --> 19:38.232
that are twice my size telling
me you are going upstairs.

19:40.870 --> 19:43.571
- We've never had a participant
take a cell on the top tier.

19:43.706 --> 19:45.472
The inmates on the top
tier are more veteran,

19:45.641 --> 19:47.341
and seem to be
the troublemakers.

19:47.476 --> 19:48.542
They know how the system works,

19:48.678 --> 19:52.513
and they can be a real
threat to first-timers.

19:53.649 --> 19:56.217
Having a participant go to the
top tier is really dangerous.

19:56.319 --> 19:58.586
(shouting)

20:13.369 --> 20:15.502
(arguing)

20:20.243 --> 20:22.810
- I went upstairs and there
was only one area for me to go

20:22.945 --> 20:26.714
and it was with a
girl named Mackenzie.

20:26.816 --> 20:29.316
- And now I'm up here
and I'm just saying.

20:29.418 --> 20:33.454
- She's pretty outgoing,
kind of a little spacey.

20:34.924 --> 20:37.725
(aggressive music)

20:54.110 --> 20:57.544
I was glad to have a bunkie
after being in classification,

20:57.680 --> 21:01.215
not having anybody talk to
me, however I could tell

21:01.384 --> 21:04.184
she's all just a
ball of just craziness.

21:14.597 --> 21:18.165
It's clear that this
girl has a drug problem.

21:29.478 --> 21:32.079
I knew right away that I
didn't trust this girl.

21:32.214 --> 21:35.816
I'm keeping my guard
completely up with her.

22:11.153 --> 22:13.354
(laughing)

22:20.663 --> 22:23.530
- When I first came in it
was the most eerie feeling

22:23.666 --> 22:25.165
that I've ever had.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.970
It was awful over there.

22:30.106 --> 22:32.306
That was so bad, and I
just kinda felt disgusted,

22:32.441 --> 22:34.375
you know because
it was so nasty.

22:47.056 --> 22:49.857
This is so disgusting, I have
never seen anything like that,

22:49.992 --> 22:52.092
that was like some
stuff that you would see

22:52.194 --> 22:54.695
in a foreign country, I
would have never expected

22:54.797 --> 22:58.565
American jails to look
like that on the inside.

22:59.635 --> 23:00.701
Say it again?

23:03.606 --> 23:07.341
Oh my first few moments in
jail have been a stone-cold gas

23:07.476 --> 23:11.879
honey, if that's what they
say on soul train but,

23:12.047 --> 23:16.116
it's disgusting, that if nothing
else, I'll say disgusting.

23:19.422 --> 23:21.121
You know, I started to
think about my daughter,

23:21.257 --> 23:22.923
and what it felt like
when she walked in

23:23.058 --> 23:24.625
and how was she acting.

23:24.727 --> 23:28.128
I feel like, you know, I can
sense her pain a little bit,

23:28.264 --> 23:31.632
I can sense her fear, I can
sense the feelings that she had.

23:31.734 --> 23:34.768
And it's overwhelming
me a little bit.

23:36.372 --> 23:38.505
(shouting)

23:58.961 --> 24:00.761
- In classification
pod, when I watch people

24:00.863 --> 24:02.463
then the more I thought that
they were just people trying

24:02.565 --> 24:04.231
to fit into a demographic.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.834
(beeping)

24:06.902 --> 24:09.002
And they want to be big,
badass, the alpha male

24:09.104 --> 24:11.305
and the silverback gorilla.

24:20.115 --> 24:23.617
And it's a lot of this
puffery, this chest
chest-pounding

24:23.752 --> 24:25.152
peacocking stuff.

24:27.456 --> 24:29.723
- This is a different world in
here, it's not like out there

24:29.825 --> 24:31.925
this is a different world.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.675
- [Captain] D-Pod's one of
the most active sections.

24:48.811 --> 24:50.611
Usually if we have a
problem in the jail,

24:50.713 --> 24:52.212
it's gonna come from D-Pod.

24:52.348 --> 24:54.414
- Animal came to the herd,

24:55.417 --> 24:57.718
it's almost kill or
be killed for real.

24:57.820 --> 24:58.919
- [Captain] We had a
lot of issues in there

24:58.988 --> 25:01.321
during Phase One, that's
why we need Ryan in there,

25:01.423 --> 25:02.689
but he needs to be careful

25:02.825 --> 25:06.360
'cause a lot of guys
in D-Pod are dangerous.

25:13.669 --> 25:16.637
(chatting, laughing)

25:40.529 --> 25:41.862
- It takes a lot to survive
in a place where you have to

25:42.031 --> 25:45.032
always be on watch,
be paranoid.

25:49.171 --> 25:51.171
Any of the typical
rules of society,

25:51.340 --> 25:53.707
none of those exist in
there, they're all gone,

25:53.842 --> 25:56.677
and you live by the new rules.

25:56.845 --> 25:58.745
And those are the rules
that I have no idea about

25:58.847 --> 26:01.014
and that I'm gonna
have to learn.

26:01.150 --> 26:03.417
(laughing)

26:35.584 --> 26:37.384
At the point where I was
underneath the stairs,

26:37.519 --> 26:42.089
I was literally just listening
and watching everybody.

26:42.191 --> 26:44.458
If you look around, there
is an archetype in there.

26:44.593 --> 26:48.228
Everybody has tattoos,
everybody has a look and a feel

26:48.330 --> 26:52.332
to them when they walk around
and I don't fit that at all.

27:18.127 --> 27:20.961
The average IQ in there
is lower that I'm used to

27:21.063 --> 27:22.329
in say college.

27:39.982 --> 27:42.115
They questioned me rapidly, like

27:42.217 --> 27:42.949
"Who's this?

27:43.052 --> 27:43.717
"Where's that?

27:43.819 --> 27:44.885
"Where's this other thing?

27:44.987 --> 27:45.986
"I've kind of been
there, so prove to me."

27:46.021 --> 27:49.656
I was just having to fire
off a bunch of stuff.

28:41.009 --> 28:43.977
(shouting, beeping)

29:20.682 --> 29:21.782
- So how does it feel
for your first time

29:21.884 --> 29:23.550
in Clark County Jail?

29:25.120 --> 29:26.052
No comment?

29:28.490 --> 29:29.923
- You've got all your
stuff and you go in

29:30.025 --> 29:32.259
and it's like a zoo.

29:32.394 --> 29:34.361
(laughing)

29:34.463 --> 29:37.097
You see like the
cages and the animals.

29:37.232 --> 29:40.333
And you say where
is my place here?

29:40.469 --> 29:44.137
And you try to adjust
to how this works.

29:44.239 --> 29:47.073
Who goes where and what is what.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.309
(chatting)

29:53.749 --> 29:56.750
It's just a learning
process, I'm gonna sit back

29:56.852 --> 29:59.519
and I'm gonna see
how this works.

30:21.877 --> 30:23.610
- Coming from being a
correction officer,

30:23.745 --> 30:26.112
I have to let go of my pride.

30:26.982 --> 30:28.615
On top of being
lost in environment,

30:28.717 --> 30:30.250
I'm lost of who I am right now.

30:30.385 --> 30:32.385
It's hard, I'm used to being
the one calling the shots

30:32.521 --> 30:35.255
and now I'm being
told what to do.

30:39.194 --> 30:40.694
Right now I'm kind
of just holding back,

30:40.796 --> 30:42.963
trying to figure out
what's my next step,

30:43.098 --> 30:46.266
because my whole goal is
just to be able to blend in

30:46.335 --> 30:48.869
and be able to walk
freely through this place

30:48.971 --> 30:52.138
so I've gotta figure
this out and quick.

31:26.341 --> 31:28.541
I've been given my pin
number and inside jail

31:28.677 --> 31:31.011
it's how we call home, you
know, most people memorize it,

31:31.146 --> 31:33.680
I'm old, I'm not memorizing
this number right now,

31:33.815 --> 31:37.350
so I'm keeping it right
down here in my bra.

32:41.850 --> 32:42.983
- Zubit.

32:43.051 --> 32:45.018
- The phone does not work
and I have not made a call

32:45.120 --> 32:47.053
since I got in,
can you let me know

32:47.122 --> 32:49.322
what they can do about that?

32:52.494 --> 32:53.326
Thank you.

32:57.232 --> 32:59.733
The answer is real simple.

32:59.835 --> 33:01.701
We get to it when we get to it.

33:01.803 --> 33:03.970
I mean like, you want
us to respect you,

33:04.106 --> 33:07.907
but you don't respect us,
I just don't get that.

33:34.736 --> 33:37.170
That's for medical emergencies?

33:37.272 --> 33:39.139
How was I supposed to know that?

33:39.207 --> 33:40.407
Why don't they have
a sign that says

33:40.542 --> 33:42.609
"For medical emergencies"?

33:44.112 --> 33:47.547
I mean, I don't have a (beep).

33:47.716 --> 33:49.649
I've never been in jail.

33:51.253 --> 33:52.519
- Monalisa has to be
careful how she acts

33:52.621 --> 33:54.287
around other inmates.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.622
She's already talking too much

33:55.757 --> 33:59.059
and bringing a lot of
attention to herself.

33:59.161 --> 34:00.360
She needs to keep
a lower profile

34:00.495 --> 34:02.729
or she could blow her cover.

34:47.676 --> 34:50.677
- Keeping things in my bra
clearly causes some controversy

34:50.779 --> 34:53.213
'cause people were
portraying that maybe I had

34:53.348 --> 34:55.181
contraband down there.

35:08.396 --> 35:10.196
They make a little short talk
and then it comes right out.

35:10.298 --> 35:11.965
"What do you have in there?

35:12.100 --> 35:14.134
"I know you got something, we
know you're in here for drugs,

35:14.236 --> 35:15.668
"what do you got?"

35:37.859 --> 35:39.692
They've convinced themselves
that I've got heroin

35:39.828 --> 35:43.296
of all things on me,
I am just so in shock.

35:52.307 --> 35:54.474
My mind's like going over and
I can hear them walking around

35:54.609 --> 35:58.244
and I'm like oh my gosh, they
wanna fight me, this is it.

36:57.806 --> 36:59.472
- I have very little
emotional intelligence, and so

36:59.608 --> 37:03.776
I can't tell you know when
people are you know standoffish
about things

37:10.218 --> 37:12.852
I don't look like or
seem like I fit in there,

37:12.954 --> 37:15.922
and I'm also new
so I'm very visible

37:16.024 --> 37:19.559
and it's understandable
they pretty much

37:19.661 --> 37:22.028
think I'm a plant at this point.

37:22.163 --> 37:26.366
So I've got an uphill battle
to convince them otherwise.

37:32.107 --> 37:35.008
- I'm worried about
Ryan blowing his cover.

37:35.110 --> 37:36.776
Once inmates suspect
you as a plant,

37:36.878 --> 37:40.313
it's almost impossible
to check that suspicion.

37:40.448 --> 37:44.083
They're gonna be watching
you all the time.

38:02.404 --> 38:05.505
(shouting, laughing)

38:16.451 --> 38:18.451
- I'm being threatened,
I can hear them saying

38:18.553 --> 38:22.722
what they're gonna do, they're
taunting me and I'm scared.

38:30.832 --> 38:32.231
- If it came down to a fighting,

38:32.367 --> 38:33.800
you though you got
them in a fight,

38:33.968 --> 38:35.935
if I were you I'd much
rather fight in the day room

38:36.071 --> 38:38.338
'cause we have cameras
all over that place.

38:38.473 --> 38:40.606
Whereas in a cell, I can't
tell you're fighting or not.

38:40.742 --> 38:43.076
You know if I got eyes on you or
not.

38:59.994 --> 39:01.527
- What is going on?

39:01.663 --> 39:04.230
- Ashley, Ashley, in the merge.

39:10.438 --> 39:14.340
I'm about to squash you,
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley,

39:14.476 --> 39:15.808
April, let's go.

39:29.290 --> 39:33.326
- The really big girl
Brenda and then like five of the

39:33.428 --> 39:35.928
girls that stay in her pod
were all out there,

39:36.064 --> 39:39.365
They were literally there was no
escaping.

39:39.567 --> 39:43.736
I don't know what's coming,
I don't know what to do.

39:49.110 --> 39:51.778
I'm panicked because
you've got a bunch of girls

39:51.880 --> 39:54.280
who are addicted to drugs,
and think I have drugs on me
