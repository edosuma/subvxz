TRIED TO FIND OUT, AFTER A
FRESHMAN DIED FROM ALCOHOL
POISONING AT A FRATERNITY HOUSE
AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY.

WANT TO DRINK," I'M CONFIDENT
THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO
HAVE TO DRINK.

00:37.537 --> 00:42.041

ACTUALLY IT'S CALLED "BLACK-OUT

THEY ARE GORILLAS IN THE SUN,

>> Anderson Cooper: WE'VE ALL
HEARD THE STORY: A HEALTHY YOUNG
MAN IS HOSPITALIZED OR DIES
AFTER BEING HAZED PLEDGING A

02:07.393 --> 02:15.034
COLLEGE FRATERNITY.
DESPITE YEARS OF EDUCATION
CAMPAIGNS AND ATTEMPTS TO STOP
UNDERAGE DRINKING, THE HAZING

02:15.101 --> 02:20.373
CONTINUES.
SOME VICTIMS' PARENTS ARE
WORKING WITH LEADERS OF NATIONAL
FRATERNITIES, PUSHING FOR

02:20.440 --> 02:26.946
TOUGHER LAWS AGAINST HAZING,
WHILE OTHER PARENTS CHARGE THE
NATIONAL FRATERNITIES THAT
OVERSEE THE LOCAL CHAPTERS, ARE,

02:27.013 --> 02:34.621
THEMSELVES, PART OF THE PROBLEM.
WHEN A FRESHMAN NAMED SAM
MARTINEZ DIED PLEDGING ALPHA TAU
OMEGA AT WASHINGTON STATE

02:34.687 --> 02:41.728
UNIVERSITY IN 2019, HIS PARENTS
SAID THE NATIONAL FRATERNITY HID
THE LOCAL CHAPTER'S HISTORY OF
HAZING, AND HINDERED THE

02:41.794 --> 02:49.202
INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR SON'S
DEATH.
>> Jolayne Houtz: IF WE HAD
KNOWN EVEN A FRACTION OF WHAT WE

02:49.269 --> 02:54.941
KNOW NOW, SAM NEVER WOULD'VE
WANTED TO JOIN THAT FRATERNITY.
WE FEEL DUPED.
>> Cooper: BY WHOM?

02:55.008 --> 03:01.981
>> Houtz: BY ALPHA TAU OMEGA,
THE NATIONAL FRATERNITY, THE
CHAPTER ON THAT CAMPUS, AND BY
WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY.

03:02.048 --> 03:09.255
>> Cooper: JOLAYNE HOUTZ AND
HECTOR MARTINEZ SAID THEY KNEW
THEIR SON, SAM, HAD BEEN
PLEDGING ALPHA TAU OMEGA FOR

03:09.322 --> 03:15.161
MORE THAN TWO MONTHS, BUT WERE
UNAWARE THAT, ACCORDING TO THE
POLICE REPORT, SOME WITNESSES
SAID HE'D ALREADY ENDURED BEING

03:15.228 --> 03:22.769
HIT, TACKLED, AND ASKED TO
CONSUME LARGE QUANTITIES OF
ALCOHOL BY A.T.O. MEMBERS.
THEY LAST SPOKE WITH SAM AROUND

03:22.835 --> 03:29.742
5:00 P.M. ON NOVEMBER 11, 2019.
>> Houtz: WE TOLD HIM THAT WE
LOVED HIM.
AND HE SAID, "I LOVE YOU TOO."

03:29.809 --> 03:35.348
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT
WE GOT TO TALK TO HIM.
>> Hector Martinez: I REMEMBER
WE, WE S-- WE SAY, "TAKE CARE OF

03:35.415 --> 03:40.620
YOURSELF."
AND HE SAY, "DON'T WORRY, I GOT
IT."
>> Cooper: AROUND 9:00 P.M., SAM

03:40.687 --> 03:46.859
WAS SUMMONED BY FRATERNITY
MEMBERS TO "BIG LITTLE NIGHT,"
WHEN EACH PLEDGE LEARNED WHO
THEIR "BIG BROTHER" WAS, AND,

03:46.926 --> 03:54.934
ACCORDING TO POLICE, GOT
INTRODUCED TO THE SO-CALLED
"FAMILY DRINK."
A.T.O. RULES FORBID HAZING AND

03:55.001 --> 04:02.842
ALCOHOL AT THE FRATERNITY HOUSE,
BUT SAM RECORDED THIS VIDEO
SHORTLY AFTER HE AND ANOTHER
PLEDGE WERE GIVEN NEARLY HALF A

04:02.909 --> 04:07.046
GALLON OF RUM BY THEIR "BIG
BROTHER"- THE EQUIVALENT OF
ABOUT 40 SHOTS.
>> Gary Jenkins: AND BASICALLY

04:07.113 --> 04:10.750
TOLD, "GO AHEAD AND START
DRINKING."
>> Cooper: TWO PEOPLE DRINKING
ALMOST HALF A GALLON OF RUM?

04:10.817 --> 04:17.023
>> Jenkins: CORRECT.
>> Cooper: GARY JENKINS IS CHIEF
OF POLICE IN PULLMAN,
WASHINGTON, WHERE WASHINGTON

04:17.090 --> 04:25.999
STATE UNIVERSITY IS LOCATED.
HE OVERSAW THE INVESTIGATION
INTO SAM MARTINEZ' DEATH.
>> Jenkins: IT WAS ABOUT A HALF

04:26.065 --> 04:29.836
AN HOUR LATER, THAT, WITNESSES
WERE TELLING US, THERE WAS ONLY
ABOUT 2.5 INCHES LEFT IN THAT--
>> Cooper: WOW.

04:29.902 --> 04:34.607
>> Jenkins: --HALF-GALLON
BOTTLE.
>> Cooper: IT WASN'T THE FIRST
VIOLATION OF A.T.O.'S

04:34.674 --> 04:42.949
DRY POLICY THAT SEMESTER.
SAM SHOT THIS VIDEO IN THE
FRATERNITY BASEMENT IN AUGUST.
ONE YOUNG MAN IS LEANING OVER A

04:43.016 --> 04:48.454
GARBAGE CAN.
TWO OTHERS APPEAR PASSED OUT.
THIS ONE IS PROPPED UP WITH A
BACKPACK.

04:48.521 --> 04:55.028
>> Jenkins: THEY WOULD PUT A
BACKPACK ON SOMEONE SO THEY
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STAY ON
THEIR BACK AND POTENTIALLY

04:55.094 --> 05:01.567
INHALE THEIR OWN VOMIT WHILE
THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS.
>> Cooper: ACCORDING TO THE
POLICE REPORT, WHEN SAM PASSED

05:01.634 --> 05:06.939
OUT, HE TOO WAS LEFT ON A SOFA
IN THE BASEMENT.
HE DIED OF ACUTE ALCOHOL
POISONING HOURS LATER.

05:07.006 --> 05:14.781
>> Jenkins: IT WAS STRICTLY FROM
TOO MUCH ALCOHOL IN HIS SYSTEM,
THAT SHUT DOWN HIS-- HIS ORGANS.
>> Cooper: I ASSUME IT WOULD'VE

05:14.847 --> 05:18.985
MADE A DIFFERENCE IF, WHEN HE
HAD FIRST PASSED OUT, SOMEBODY
HAD CALLED 911?
>> Jenkins: ABSOLUTELY.

05:19.052 --> 05:23.222
>> Cooper: OR TAKEN HIM TO AN
EMERGENCY ROOM?
>> Jenkins: SURE.
I MEAN, HE WAS-- HE WAS ALIVE

05:23.289 --> 05:28.628
TILL AROUND 4:00 OR 4:30 IN THE
MORNING.
ANY TIME BEFORE THEN, MORE THAN
LIKELY, HIS LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN

05:28.695 --> 05:38.771
SAVED.
>> Cooper: A FRATERNITY MEMBER
DID FINALLY CALL 911, AT 8:30
A.M.

05:38.838 --> 05:44.444
POLICE AND E.M.T.s FOUND SAM'S
BODY ON THE BASEMENT FLOOR.
HIS BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS
NEARLY FIVE TIMES THE LEGAL

05:44.510 --> 05:48.881
LIMIT.
>> YO, GET OUT OF THE ROOM, YOU
GUYS.
>> Coper: LATER, ACCORDING TO

05:48.948 --> 05:54.921
POLICE, THE FRATERNITY'S STUDENT
PRESIDENT TOLD THEM HE GOT
ADVICE FROM A.T.O.'S NATIONAL
HEADQUARTERS THAT CHIEF JENKINS

05:54.987 --> 06:00.993
SAID HAMPERED THE INVESTIGATION.
>> Jenkins: THE STUDENT
PRESIDENT OF THE FRATERNITY TOLD
US THAT THEY GOT WORD FROM

06:01.060 --> 06:09.669
NATIONAL TO-- TO INSTRUCT ALL OF
THEIR MEMBERS TO DELETE ALL
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA.
AND SO, THAT TELLS ME A LOT

06:09.736 --> 06:13.906
ABOUT-- ABOUT THE NATIONAL
ORGANIZATION, WHETHER THEY'RE
REALLY INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH.
>> Cooper: DID THEY PREVENT

06:13.973 --> 06:19.412
JUSTICE?
>> Jenkins: I THINK SO.
I THINK THERE WAS VERY LIKELY
INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE VERY

06:19.479 --> 06:26.819
RELEVANT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF
SAM'S DEATH THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
IN SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT NOW WE'LL
NEVER KNOW.

06:26.886 --> 06:31.424
>> Cooper: EIGHT MONTHS AFTER
SAM'S DEATH, HIS PARENTS FILED
SUIT AGAINST A.T.O., ITS
MEMBERS, AND WASHINGTON STATE

06:31.491 --> 06:37.330
UNIVERSITY.
DOUG FIERBERG, THEIR ATTORNEY,
HAS LITIGATED MORE THAN 40
HAZING CASES DURING THE LAST TWO

06:37.396 --> 06:42.101
DECADES.
>> Doug Fierberg: THIS IS AN
INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN
THIS SORT OF MISCONDUCT FOR

06:42.168 --> 06:46.739
DECADES.
>> Cooper: I DON'T THINK A LOT
OF PEOPLE THINK OF FRATERNITIES
AS AN INDUSTRY.

06:46.806 --> 06:52.645
>> Fierberg: IT'S A NETWORK OF
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THERE
TRYING TO SOLICIT MEMBERSHIP
FROM YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE AWAY

06:52.712 --> 06:58.584
FROM HOME, OFTEN FOR THE FIRST
TIME, AND IT'S CLEARLY DESIGNED
TO MAKE MONEY, LIKE ANY OTHER
INDUSTRY.

06:58.651 --> 07:04.624
>> Cooper: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF
FRATERNITY LEADERSHIP?
>> Fierberg: THEY HAVE COMPLETE
CONTROL, BUT ALSO PAIR THAT WITH

07:04.690 --> 07:10.997
DENIABILITY.
BECAUSE, PRINCIPAL TO THEM IS
THIS IDEA THAT WHEN SOMEBODY
DIES-- AND THAT'S GOING TO

07:11.063 --> 07:18.404
HAPPEN-- OR WHEN SOMEBODY IS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED-- AND THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN-- THAT THEY HAVE
SOME BLOCKADE BETWEEN THEM AND

07:18.471 --> 07:27.079
THE VICTIM, IN TERMS OF
LIABILITY.
>> Wynn Smiley: MY PRIMARY GOAL,
WHEN SAM DIED, WAS TO FIND OUT

07:27.146 --> 07:34.620
WHAT HAPPENED.
LIABILITY WAS THE LAST THING ON
MY MIND.
>> Cooper: WYNN SMILEY HAS BEEN

07:34.687 --> 07:42.595
C.E.O. OF ALPHA TAU OMEGA'S
NATIONAL FRATERNITY ORGANIZATION
FOR 25 YEARS AND REPORTS TO A
BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT HAS

07:42.662 --> 07:50.536
AUTHORITY OVER ITS MULTIMILLION
DOLLAR BUDGET.
HE SAID THEY SET THE RULES FOR
A.T.O.'S 137 LOCAL CHAPTERS

07:50.603 --> 07:55.241
NATIONWIDE, EDUCATE MEMBERS
AGGRESSIVELY ON THEIR POLICIES
BANNING HAZING AND UNDERAGE
DRINKING, AND HAVE THE POWER TO

07:55.308 --> 08:02.715
SHUT LOCAL CHAPTERS DOWN.
AFTER SAM'S DEATH, WYNN SMILEY
FLEW TO WASHINGTON STATE
UNIVERSITY THE NEXT DAY.

08:02.782 --> 08:10.623
>> Smiley: WE WANTED TO FIND OUT
WHO BROKE A.T.O. POLICY.
THEY KNOWINGLY DECIDED TO
PROVIDE ALCOHOL TO SAM, WHICH IS

08:10.690 --> 08:18.130
A VIOLATION NOT ON-- ONLY OF OUR
ALCOHOL POLICY, BUT ALSO OF OUR
HAZING POLICY.
>> Cooper: WE UNDERSTAND YOU

08:18.197 --> 08:25.004
CAME WITH AN "INSURANCE
ADJUSTER."
>> Smiley: I CAME WITH LINDA,
WHO IS A GREAT INVESTIGATOR.

08:25.071 --> 08:28.507
SHE ACTS LIKE A MOTHER, AS IT
RELATES TO THEM FEELING--
FEELING COMFORTABLE WITH HER.
>> Cooper: IS SHE AN INSURANCE

08:28.574 --> 08:33.346
ADJUSTER?
>> Smiley: SHE IS.
>> Cooper: DO YOU TURN OVER THE
RESULTS OF ANY INTERVIEWS YOU'VE

08:33.412 --> 08:37.884
DONE WITH MEMBERS TO THE POLICE?
>> Smiley: DEPENDS ON THE
SITUATION.
>> Cooper: IN SAM'S DEATH, DID

08:37.950 --> 08:42.755
YOU?
>> Smiley: I HA-- I-- I DON'T--
I DON'T RECALL, FRANKLY.
>> Cooper: IF YOU WANT TO BE

08:42.822 --> 08:46.492
TRANSPARENT, YOU WOULD TURN OVER
THE RESULTS OF THOSE INTERVIEWS
TO THE POLICE, NO?
>> Smiley: WE WOULD HAVE

08:46.559 --> 08:52.431
CERTAINLY PROVIDED THAT
INFORMATION, HAD WE-- HAD THE
POLICE ASKED.
>> Cooper: CHIEF JENKINS TOLD US

08:52.498 --> 08:58.738
HIS OFFICERS WERE UNAWARE WYNN
SMILEY AND ALPHA TAU OMEGA'S
INSURANCE ADJUSTER WERE
CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION, AND

08:58.804 --> 09:04.644
RECEIVED NO INFORMATION FROM
A.T.O. ABOUT WHAT MEMBERS TOLD
THEM.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRATERNITY

09:04.710 --> 09:14.120
TOLD THE POLICE THAT, AND I'M
QUOTING, "NATIONAL'S A.T.O. HAD
TOLD THEM TO DELETE ALL THEIR
SOCIAL MEDIA."

09:14.186 --> 09:22.461
>> Smiley: ANY TIME THE CHAPTER
IS IN A SITUATION WHERE IT HAS
KNOWINGLY VIOLATED A.T.O.
POLICY, AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

09:22.528 --> 09:26.832
GOING TO BE NEWS COVERAGE, WE
ADVISE CHAPTERS TO TAKE DOWN
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA.
WE DID NOT TELL THEM TO

09:26.899 --> 09:32.505
"DELETE."
WE NEVER TELL ANYBODY DELETE--
DELETE ANYBODY'S SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> Cooper: DID YOU TELL MEMBERS

09:32.571 --> 09:37.710
TO SAVE ALL OF THEIR
COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT, IN ORDER TO
GIVE IT TO POLICE?

09:37.777 --> 09:44.650
>> Smiley: WE TOLD MEMBERS TO
COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE POLICE.
>> SO, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

09:44.717 --> 09:50.089
>> Cooper: BUT ACCORDING TO
CHIEF JENKINS, FRATERNITY
MEMBERS WERE NOT PARTICULARLY
COOPERATIVE.

09:50.156 --> 09:54.927
>> Jenkins: WE DEFINITELY FOUND
THAT, WHEN INTERVIEWING
FRATERNITY MEMBERS, THAT THEY
WERE LESS THAN FORTHCOMING.

09:54.994 --> 10:01.968
AND-- AND WE FOUND A LOT OF
CONFLICTS BETWEEN WHAT THEY TOLD
US AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TOLD
US, WHO KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

10:02.034 --> 10:06.939
>> Cooper: SAM'S PARENTS SAY IT
WAS ONLY AFTER HIS DEATH THEY
LEARNED A.T.O. HAD A TROUBLED
PAST AT WASHINGTON STATE

10:07.006 --> 10:14.380
UNIVERSITY.
IN 2013, W.S.U. PUT THE
FRATERNITY ON PROBATION FOR NINE
MONTHS BECAUSE OF ALCOHOL-

10:14.447 --> 10:20.820
RELATED HAZING.
>> Houtz: PARENTS NEED TO SEE
THE TRACK RECORD, THE
DISCIPLINARY HISTORY OF THESE

10:20.886 --> 10:26.392
FRATERNITIES, SO THAT, YOU KNOW,
WE CAN BE INFORMED.
>> Cooper: THEY COULD EASILY DO
THAT.

10:26.459 --> 10:33.966
>> Houtz: I THINK SO.
>> Cooper: IN 2018, AFTER
ANOTHER COMPLAINT OF HAZING,
A.T.O.'S NATIONAL OFFICE STEPPED

10:34.033 --> 10:38.938
IN AND REMOVED NEARLY HALF THE
CHAPTER'S MEMBERS-- SOME 30
STUDENTS-- THOUGH A.T.O. NEVER
DISCLOSED WHY.

10:39.005 --> 10:46.645
DID YOU MAKE THAT INFORMATION
PUBLIC ANYWHERE?
>> Smiley: WE HAD THAT
CONVERSATION WITH THE MEMBERS,

10:46.712 --> 10:51.050
IN TERMS OF WHY THEY'RE BEING
EXPELLED, AND THEY CAN CERTAINLY
SHARE THAT WITH WHOMEVER THEY
WANT.

10:51.117 --> 10:58.624
>> Cooper: BUT YOU DON'T PUBLISH
INFORMATION ON YOUR WEBSITE
ABOUT WHAT YOU FIND.
WHY NOT BE UP-FRONT ABOUT WHAT

10:58.691 --> 11:04.397
YOU ACTUALLY FOUND?
>> Smiley: WE'RE MOVING FORWARD
WITH THE MEN WHO ARE IN THE
CHAPTER, WHO WE BELIEVE--

11:04.463 --> 11:10.636
>> Cooper: YOU PUT A LOT OF VERY
POSITIVE STUFF ABOUT A.T.O.
ON YOUR WEBSITE.
DON'T YOU ALSO OWE IT TO

11:10.703 --> 11:14.874
POTENTIAL PLEDGES AND THEIR
PARENTS TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOUR
FRATERNITY?

11:14.940 --> 11:18.044
>> Smiley: IF WE THOUGHT THAT
WOULD HELP, BUT WE DON'T
CONSIDER IT--
>> Cooper: WHY DON'T YOU THINK

11:18.110 --> 11:21.480
THAT WOULD HELP?
>> Smiley: BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT-- I DON'T THINK
UNDERGRADUATES LOOK AT WEBSITES.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.117
AND I DON'T THINK--
>> Cooper: WAIT!
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.888
YOU-- YOU "DON'T THINK
UNDERGRADUATES LOOK AT
WEBSITES"?
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT ALL

11:28.954 --> 11:34.627
THIS INFORMATION ON YOUR
WEBSITE, IT MIGHT DISSUADE
PEOPLE FROM CHOOSING TO PLEDGE
YOUR FRATERNITY.

11:34.693 --> 11:39.265
>> Smiley: THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT
WHY WE WOULDN'T PUT IT ON.
WE'RE CONSIDERING-- WE'RE
LOOKING AT THAT.

11:39.331 --> 11:46.639
>> Cooper: WYNN SMILEY TOLD US
HE SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO INCREASE
CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR HAZING,
BUT DOESN'T BELIEVE HIS NATIONAL

11:46.705 --> 11:52.278
ORGANIZATION HAS A DUTY TO
SUPERVISE ITS LOCAL CHAPTERS.
>> Smiley: THESE ARE SELF-
GOVERNING, INDEPENDENT

11:52.344 --> 11:56.148
ORGANIZATIONS FOR A REASON.
>> Cooper: RIGHT.
BUT YOU-- YOU WANT THEM TO BE.
YOU ARE MAKING MONEY FROM THEM.

11:56.215 --> 12:00.719
OU CAN SHUT THEM DOWN.
YOU CAN GO IN AND TELL THEM THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DRUG-TEST.
YOU<i> DO</i> HAVE A SUPERVISORY

12:00.786 --> 12:06.592
FUNCTION; YOU JUST ARE NOT
WANTING TO EMBRACE IT.
>> Smiley: AND IF WE THOUGHT
THAT THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE, WE

12:06.659 --> 12:10.629
MAY CONSIDER THAT.
>> Cooper: YOU DON'T WANT ANY
ADULT SUPERVISION THAT'S
DIRECTLY LINKED TO YOU.

12:10.696 --> 12:14.934
YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL.
>> Smiley: WE'RE NOT CONVINCED
THAT THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE

12:15.000 --> 12:20.506
BENEFICIAL.
>> Jenkins: I DON'T THINK THEY
COULD BE MORE WRONG.
I THINK HAVING AN ADULT THERE,

12:20.573 --> 12:25.377
TO OVERSEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND
ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING
WITH THEIR OWN HANDBOOK--
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON WAS

12:25.444 --> 12:30.950
IN VIOLATION OF WHAT THEIR
HANDBOOK SAYS.
>> Houtz: THEY SET THEMSELVES UP
TO ENSURE THAT IF SOMETHING GOES

12:31.016 --> 12:38.924
WRONG, THAT THEY CAN'T BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
AND THEY'LL POINT TO THE ROGUE
FRATERNITY MEMBERS OR THEY'LL

12:38.991 --> 12:44.330
POINT TO THE UNIVERSITY OR
THEY'LL POINT AT THE YOUNG DEAD
PLEDGE AND BLAME THEM, BUT IT'S
NEVER THEIR FAULT.

12:44.396 --> 12:49.935
>> Cooper: DID THEY TRY TO BLAME
SAM?
>> Houtz: OH YEAH.
WHY WAS HE DRINKING THAT NIGHT?

12:50.002 --> 12:56.809
IT'S-- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO
HERE.
>> Cooper: WYNN SMILEY SAYS SAM
MARTINEZ WASN'T BULLIED OR

12:56.876 --> 13:03.082
PRESSURED INTO DRINKING THE
NIGHT HE DIED.
>> Smiley: WHEN PUSH COMES TO
SHOVE, THE PLEDGES CAN STAND UP

13:03.149 --> 13:06.485
AND SAY, "NO."
>> Cooper: WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A
MINUTE, COME ON.
>> Smiley: AND I DON'T WANT TO

13:06.552 --> 13:10.623
PUT-- I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT
ON THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT ON
THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT FAIR.

13:10.689 --> 13:14.927
I'M JUST SAYING THAT-
>> Cooper: BUT-- BUT COME ON.
YOU KNOW IF A PLEDGE SAYS, "THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

13:14.994 --> 13:23.402
I'M NOT GOING TO DRINK HOT
SAUCE, I'M NOT GOING TO DO, YOU
KNOW, SQUATS AGAINST THE WALL,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO 20 SHOTS

13:23.469 --> 13:28.641
OF RUM," THEY WOULDN'T GET INTO
THE FRATERNITY.
>> Smiley: NO, AND I'M TELLING
YOU THEY WOULD.

13:28.707 --> 13:34.413
>> Cooper: THIS IS THE SECOND-
BIGGEST NIGHT IN THE ENTIRE
PLEDGE PROCESS THAT SAM HAS
UNDERTAKEN.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.817
>> Smiley: HE WAS PROVIDED THE
ALCOHOL, SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
PROVIDED THE ALCOHOL--
>> Cooper: HE WASN'T "PROVIDED

13:38.884 --> 13:44.857
THE ALCOHOL," LIKE SOMEBODY JUST
GOES AND GETS BEER FOR SOME KIDS
HANGING OUTSIDE A 7-ELEVEN.
HE WAS HANDED A-- NEARLY HALF A

13:44.924 --> 13:48.494
GALLON OF RUM.
YOU'RE SAYING H-- IF HE HAD JUST
SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, THIS IS RIDICULOUS," THEY

13:48.561 --> 13:52.264
WOULD'VE SAID, "GREAT.
YOU-- YOU CAN BE A MEMBER OF OUR
FRATERNITY.
THAT'S GREAT.

13:52.331 --> 13:58.637
THAT SHOWS SPUNK ON YOUR PART."
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED?
>> Smiley: HAD HE SAID, "NO, I

13:58.704 --> 14:02.942
DON'T WANT TO DRINK," I'M
CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE
HAD TO HAVE DRINKED.
>> Cooper: HE'D ALREADY HAD DATE

14:03.008 --> 14:07.413
NIGHT.
ACTUALLY IT'S CALLED "BLACK-OUT
DATE NIGHT," I BELIEVE.
WHAT HAPPENS ON BLACK-OUT DATE

14:07.479 --> 14:14.453
NIGHT?
>> Smiley: SO, WHOEVER ORGANIZED
THAT EVENT, FOR THE FRATERNITY,
AGAIN, DID SO OUTSIDE OF A.T.O.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.623
POLICY.
AND PEOPLE WERE-- WERE CONNECTED
WITH DATES, OR THEY BROUGHT A
DATE--

14:17.690 --> 14:21.794
>> Cooper: THEY WERE HANDCUFFED
TO DATES.
>> Smiley: SOME WERE.
AND--

14:21.860 --> 14:25.798
>> Cooper: YEAH, WELL, HE WAS
HANDCUFFED TO A WOMAN, AND TOLD
TO DRINK-- I THINK IT WAS A
HALF-BOTTLE OF VODKA.

14:25.864 --> 14:33.706
>> Smiley: AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER
BEEN PUT IN THAT POSITION.
>> Cooper: IN JULY, ALPHA TAU
OMEGA SETTLED THE LAWSUIT

14:33.772 --> 14:39.278
BROUGHT BY SAM MARTINEZ' PARENTS
WITHOUT ADMITTING WRONGDOING.
WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
REMOVED ITS RECOGNITION OF THE

14:39.345 --> 14:46.652
CHAPTER, AND THEN A.T.O.
REVOKED ITS CHARTER.
THE CHAPTER CAN SEEK
REINSTATEMENT IN 2026.

14:46.719 --> 14:54.927
SEVEN FRATERNITY MEMBERS HAVE
BEEN SENTENCED TO BETWEEN ONE
AND 19 DAYS IN JAIL FOR SERVING
ALCOHOL TO MINORS.

14:54.994 --> 15:02.935
SAM'S PARENTS ARE NOW WORKING
WITH STATE LEGISLATORS TO TRY TO
MAKE HAZING A FELONY.
>> Houtz: HE WAS THE BEAUTIFUL,

15:03.002 --> 15:10.976
QUIRKY, FUNNY CENTER OF OUR
WORLD.
AND IT FELT LIKE THE EARTH JUST
FELL AWAY THE DAY THAT WE

15:11.043 --> 15:20.019
LEARNED THE NEWS.
>> Cooper: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
SEE HAPPEN?
>> Houtz: I DON'T WANT TO SEE

15:20.085 --> 15:22.688
ANY MORE YOUNG MEN DIE.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:31.630 --> 15:39.538
>> Lesley Stahl: WITH CLOSE TO A
MILLION SPECIES NOW THREATENED
WITH EXTINCTION, IT'S NOT OFTEN
YOU HEAR ABOUT A CONSERVATION

15:39.605 --> 15:47.646
SUCCESS STORY, BUT THE MOUNTAIN
GORILLAS OF THE EAST AFRICAN
NATION OF RWANDA ARE JUST THAT.
WHEN AMERICAN NATURALIST DIAN

15:47.713 --> 15:55.754
FOSSEY MOVED TO RWANDA HALF A
CENTURY AGO TO STUDY MOUNTAIN
GORILLAS, THEIR NUMBERS WERE
DWINDLING, DOWN TO JUST 254

15:55.821 --> 16:04.330
INDIVIDUALS.
BUT TODAY THEY'RE UP TO OVER
600, WITH ANOTHER 400 IN
NEIGHBORING UGANDA-- THE ONLY

16:04.396 --> 16:12.037
GREAT APE WHOSE NUMBERS ARE
ACTUALLY ON THE RISE.
HOW THEY'VE DONE IT?
A JOINT EFFORT BY SCIENTISTS AND

16:12.104 --> 16:23.782
GOVERNMENT TO SAVE GORILLAS AND
HELP THE HUMAN COMMUNITIES
AROUND THEM, WITH A KEY ROLE
PLAYED... BY TOURISTS.

16:23.849 --> 16:31.757
THESE ARE THE VIRUNGA VOLCANOES,
HOME TO MOST OF THE WORLD'S
MOUNTAIN GORILLAS.
DIAN FOSSEY APTLY CALLED THEM

16:31.824 --> 16:43.736
GORILLAS IN THE MIST.
BUT WHEN THE MIST LIFTS...
THEY ARE GORILLAS IN THE SUN,
DOING WHAT MOUNTAIN GORILLAS

16:43.802 --> 16:54.012
DO... EAT... REST... EAT SOME
MORE... AND SNUGGLE.
>> Tara Stoinski: WHEN YOU LOOK
IN THE EYES OF A GORILLA, YOU

16:54.079 --> 17:00.052
SEE A KINDRED SPIRIT LOOKING
BACK AT YOU.
THEY ARE SO MUCH LIKE US.
THEY HAVE FRIENDS, THEY HAVE

17:00.119 --> 17:05.124
ENEMIES.
THEY LOVE TO PLAY.
THEY LOVE TO EAT.
THEY LOVE TO NAP.

17:05.190 --> 17:10.896
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE MOMS AND
INCREDIBLE DADS.
>> Stoinski: SO, WE'RE GOING TO
PULL THIS ONE OUT.

17:10.963 --> 17:17.269
>> Stahl: PRIMATOLOGIST TARA
STOINSKI HEADS THE DIAN FOSSEY
GORILLA FUND, A NON-PROFIT
RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION

17:17.336 --> 17:22.875
ORGANIZATION THAT GREW OUT OF
FOSSEY'S WORK.
HOW MANY YEARS DID SHE LIVE UP
HERE ALONE?

17:22.941 --> 17:31.750
>> Stoinski: SHE WAS IN THE
FOREST FOR 18 YEARS.
>> Stahl: FOSSEY WAS SENT TO
RWANDA IN 1967 BY FAMED

17:31.817 --> 17:39.258
ANTHROPOLOGIST LOUIS LEAKEY, WHO
HAD ALSO SENT JANE GOODALL TO
TANZANIA TO STUDY CHIMPS.
>> Stoinski: THE PEOPLE IN THE

17:39.324 --> 17:43.395
REGION, THEY GAVE HER A
NICKNAME: NYIRAMACIBIRI, WHICH
MEANT "WOMAN THAT LIVES ALONE IN
THE FOREST."

17:43.462 --> 17:46.665
I'M SURE THEY WONDERED, LIKE,
WHAT WAS SHE DOING UP THERE?
>> Stahl: STRANGE WOMAN LIVING
UP--

17:46.732 --> 17:49.768
>> Stoinski: STRANGE WOMAN.
>> Stahl: --IN THE MOUNT--
>> Stoinski: AND VERY TALL.
SHE WAS 6'.

17:49.835 --> 17:56.442
THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM 1969.
>> Stahl: WHAT SHE WAS DOING, AS
STOINSKI SHOWED US, WAS
OBSERVING GORILLAS FOR HOURS A

17:56.508 --> 18:04.049
DAY.
>> Stoinski: WHAT SHE WOULD DO
EACH NIGHT IS COME BACK AND TYPE
UP ALL OF HER NOTES.

18:04.116 --> 18:09.521
>> Stahl: "THERE IS SOME SOFT
PIG GRUNTING HEARD FROM THE
SILVERBACK, AND GAS IS
RELEASED."

18:09.588 --> 18:13.859
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AND THIS JUST GOES ON AND--
>> Stoinski: ON AND ON, YEAH.
>> Stahl: ON AND ON?

18:13.926 --> 18:22.801
FOSSEY'S RESEARCH-- AND HER
APPEARANCES IN "NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC"-- HELPED CHANGE THE
PERCEPTION OF GORILLAS FROM

18:22.868 --> 18:28.474
AGGRESSIVE, KING KONG BRUTES, TO
THE GENTLE VEGETARIAN GIANTS
THEY ACTUALLY ARE.
BUT GORILLAS BACK THEN WERE

18:28.540 --> 18:36.448
UNDER ASSAULT.
WHY WERE THERE POACHERS?
WHY WERE PEOPLE INTERESTED?
>> Stoinski: WELL, AT THE TIME,

18:36.515 --> 18:43.255
PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY WANTED
PARTS OF GORILLAS AS TROPHIES.
SO THEY WANTED A GORILLA HEAD
FOR THEIR MANTELPIECE, OR A-- A

18:43.322 --> 18:49.761
GORILLA HAND.
>> Stahl: THE GORILLAS' HABITAT
WAS ALSO BEING EATEN AWAY, AS
THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FOREST

18:49.828 --> 19:00.038
WERE CUT DOWN SO FARMERS COULD
PLANT CASH CROPS UP THE
MOUNTAINSIDE.
THE DEMARCATION LINE BETWEEN

19:00.105 --> 19:06.211
FARMLAND AND FOREST STANDS OUT
LIKE A BAD HAIRCUT, SHOWING HOW
LITTLE LAND GORILLAS HAVE LEFT.
WE CUT DOWN THEIR HOMES.

19:06.278 --> 19:12.050
>> Stoinski: YEAH, I MEAN,
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S THE STORY
FOR WILDLIFE AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Stahl: BUT HERE, THAT STORY

19:12.117 --> 19:20.392
IS GETTING A REWRITE, AND THE
NEW VERSION STARTS AT VOLCANOES
NATIONAL PARK HEADQUARTERS EVERY
MORNING, WHERE TOURISTS GATHER

19:20.459 --> 19:28.066
TO TREK TO SEE GORILLAS, LED BY
EXPERT GUIDES.
>> THEY CAN LIVE UP TO 45 YEARS.
>> Stahl: THE RWANDAN GOVERNMENT

19:28.133 --> 19:36.174
REGULATES THE VISITS-- NO MORE
THAN EIGHT PEOPLE PER GROUP, FOR
JUST ONE HOUR WITH THE GORILLAS,
WITH PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO

19:36.241 --> 19:48.053
PROTECT THEM FROM HUMAN ILLNESS.
THE PRICE TAG IS STEEP-- $1,500
PER PERSON-- TURNING RWANDA, A
COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS HORRIFIC

19:48.120 --> 19:55.093
1994 GENOCIDE, NOT SO MUCH FOR
ITS BEAUTIFUL SCENERY, INTO A
PRIME DESTINATION FOR THE
WEALTHY.

19:55.160 --> 20:01.767
SOME OF THE MOST LUXURIOUS
HOTELS IN THE WORLD HAVE OPENED
HERE, GENERATING TENS OF
MILLIONS IN TOURISM REVENUE.

20:01.833 --> 20:07.906
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DIAMONDS,
OIL.
WOULD YOU SAY THAT GORILLAS ARE
THE MOST IMPORTANT NATURAL

20:07.973 --> 20:11.810
RESOURCE OF THIS WHOLE COUNTRY?
>> Stoinski: DEFINITELY.
DEFINITELY--
>> Stahl: DEFINITELY?

20:11.877 --> 20:16.148
>> Stoinski: YEAH.
IT'S ONE OF IF NOT THE TOP
SOURCE OF FOREIGN REVENUE, IS
TOURISM TO SEE THE GORILLAS.

20:16.214 --> 20:20.485
>> Stahl: FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY?
>> Stoinski: FOR THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.
>> Stahl: THE GOVERNMENT GIVES

20:20.552 --> 20:28.060
10% OF THE MONEY FROM THOSE
GORILLA TREKS TO DISTRICTS THAT
BORDER NATIONAL PARKS, IN A
PROGRAM CALLED TOURISM REVENUE

20:28.126 --> 20:33.632
SHARING.
>> Prosper Uwingeli: AS YOU SEE
THIS SCHOOL BEHIND, THAT WAS
BEFORE.

20:33.699 --> 20:39.938
>> Stahl: CHIEF PARK WARDEN
PROSPER UWINGELI MET US AT A
LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL.
BEHIND HIM WAS THE OLD SCHOOL.

20:40.005 --> 20:45.277
BEHIND ME...
>> Uwingeli: LOOK AT THE
WINDOWS.
>> Stahl: NEW CLASSROOMS PAID

20:45.344 --> 20:48.880
FOR BY TOURISM REVENUE SHARING
FUNDS.
IT COSTS $1,500
>> Uwingeli: YES.

20:48.947 --> 20:55.787
>> Stahl: TO GO SEE THE GORILLAS
FOR ONE HOUR.
>> Uwingeli: FOR ONE HOUR.
SPECIAL EXPERIENCE.

20:55.854 --> 21:01.660
>> Stahl: HE ADMITS IT'S A LOT,
BUT SAYS IT'S MADE A TREMENDOUS
DIFFERENCE IN HIS MEETINGS WITH
LOCAL LEADERS.

21:01.727 --> 21:05.831
>> Uwingeli: WE GO THERE AND WE
LISTEN WHAT COMMUNITIES WANT THE
TOURISM REVENUE SHARING TO-- TO
SUPPORT.

21:05.897 --> 21:11.870
>> Stahl: THEY DECIDE?
>> Uwingeli: YEAH, THEY DECIDE.
>> Stahl: THIS VILLAGE BUILT A
HEALTH CENTER.

21:11.937 --> 21:20.512
THIS ONE NEW HOUSING WITH WATER
TANKS AND ELECTRICITY.
HERE, A NEW MARKETPLACE.
THE 10% GIVES COMMUNITIES UP TO

21:20.579 --> 21:31.790
650,000 U.S. DOLLARS A YEAR.
>> GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.
>> Stahl: UWINGELI DIVIDES HIS
TIME BETWEEN GREETING TOURISTS,

21:31.857 --> 21:37.763
MANAGING HIS RANGERS, AND
TRAVELING AROUND THESE VILLAGES,
TALKING, CAJOLING, AND
CELEBRATING WHAT TOURISM REVENUE

21:37.829 --> 21:47.472
HAS ACHIEVED.
(<i> CLAPPING</i> )
A FEW YEARS BACK, THIS COMMUNITY
CHOSE TO GET MILKING COWS, WHICH

21:47.539 --> 21:52.978
HAVE SINCE HAD CALVES.
SO, THE COWS ARE NOW BEING GIVEN
TO NEW NEEDY FAMILIES.
♪ ♪ ♪

21:53.045 --> 22:00.052
AND THOSE COLORFUL STRIPED
SWEATERS?
THEY'RE A PRODUCT OF TOURISM
REVENUE SHARING, TOO.

22:00.118 --> 22:06.158
ONE YEAR THIS COMMUNITY USED ITS
FUNDS TO BUY KNITTING MACHINES.
A LOT OF THE GUIDES, PORTERS
COME FROM THESE COMMUNITIES--

22:06.224 --> 22:09.227
>> Stoinski: --FROM THESE
COMMUNITIES.
AND SOME OF THEM ARE FORMER
POACHERS THEMSELVES.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.064
>> Stahl: NO?
>> Stoinski: YEAH.
>> Stahl: SOME OF THE PORTERS
AND GUIDES?

22:12.130 --> 22:15.967
>> Stoinski: YEAH.
>> Stahl: WERE POACHERS?
>> Stoinski: OR COME FROM
POACHER FAMILIES.

22:16.034 --> 22:19.905
>> Stahl: SO, HAS ALL POACHING
OF GORILLAS STOPPED?
>> Uwingeli: YEAH.
IN RWANDA, YES.

22:19.971 --> 22:31.349
CONFIDENTLY, YES.
>> Stahl: BUT GORILLAS CAN STILL
GET CAUGHT IN SNARES SET FOR
SMALLER ANIMALS LIKE ANTELOPES,

22:31.416 --> 22:37.789
SO THE FOSSEY FUND DISPATCHES A
SMALL ARMY OF TRACKERS EVERY
MORNING, 365 DAYS A YEAR.
>> Stoinski: WE GO OUT INTO THE

22:37.856 --> 22:42.427
FOREST.
WE KNOW EVERY GORILLA IN ALL OF
THE FAMILIES THAT WE MONITOR.
WE CHECK AND MAKE SURE EVERY ONE

22:42.494 --> 22:48.066
OF THEM IS OKAY.
IF ONE LOOKS ILL, WE'LL NOTIFY
THE VETERINARIANS.
AND WE CALL THIS EXTREME

22:48.133 --> 22:55.073
CONSERVATION.
>> Stahl: IT COULD ALSO BE
CALLED AN EXTREME WORKOUT.
OH, BOY.

22:55.140 --> 23:01.780
WE SET OFF ON A GORILLA TREK
WITH STOINSKI, UWINGELI AND A
TEAM OF PORTERS.
VISITING MOUNTAIN GORILLAS IS NO

23:01.847 --> 23:11.890
WALK IN THE PARK.
IT'S AN UPHILL HIKE FOR MORE
TAN AN HOUR AT AN ALTITUDE OF
8,000 FEET, THROUGH THAT

23:11.957 --> 23:16.561
FARMLAND THAT ONCE BELONGED TO
THE GORILLAS.
CAN WE STOP HERE?
JUST TO GET TO THE PARK.

23:16.628 --> 23:20.232
ARE YOU OUT OF BREATH?
>> Stoinski: YES.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: OR IS IT JUST ME?

23:20.298 --> 23:25.771
THEN, JUST AS WE REACHED THE
PARK BORDER...
(<i> GASP</i> )
OH, MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS, I

23:25.837 --> 23:32.144
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
A SILVERBACK, USED TO SEEING
TOURISTS, SAT CALMLY EATING.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

23:32.210 --> 23:40.051
>> YEAH, COME, COME.
>> Stahl: UNFAZED BY OUR GAWKING
AND POINTING.
UWINGELI TOLD US HE'S AN ADULT

23:40.118 --> 23:49.761
MALE NAMED LISANGA.
FOSSEY FUND COUNTRY DIRECTOR
FELIX NDAGIJIMANA TAUGHT US HOW
TO SIGNAL THAT WE COME IN PEACE.

>> Ndagijimana: OH, THAT'S VERY
GOOD.

23:55.567 --> 24:00.038
>> Stahl: INSIDE THE PARK, AFTER
MORE CLIMBING.
>> Stoinski: LOOK, LESLEY, LOOK.
LESLEY--

24:00.105 --> 24:07.779
>> Stahl: OH, LOOK AT THE BABY.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WE FOUND THE REST OF LISANGA'S
GROUP.

24:07.846 --> 24:13.785
>> Uwingeli: LET'S FOLLOW THEM.
>> Stahl: UWINGELI TOLD US THE
DOMINANT SILVERBACK WAS HEADING
HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN, SO THE

24:13.852 --> 24:24.029
WHOLE GROUP WAS FOLLOWING.
AND SO WERE WE.
IN A SIGN OF THE POPULATION'S
HEALTH, THIS GROUP HAS FIVE

24:24.095 --> 24:28.066
INFANTS, AND SEVERAL JUVENILES.
OH, MY GOODNESS, THEY'RE--
>> Stoinski: YEAH, THEY'RE
HAVING A BALL.

24:28.133 --> 24:32.170
>> Stahl: THAT'S SERIOUS.
>> Stoinski: THEY'RE HAVING A
BALL.
>> Stahl: SHE TOLD US THEY PLAY

24:32.237 --> 24:43.849
FOR FUN-- AND TO PRACTICE
FIGHTING.
OR PERHAPS, JUST TO SHOW US
WHO'S BOSS.

24:46.918 --> 24:54.159
NEAR US IN THE FOREST, IT
SOUNDED LIKE A SILVERBACK PHOTO
SHOOT WAS GOING ON.
BUT FOSSEY FUND RESEARCH

24:54.226 --> 25:03.969
ASSISTANT NADIA NIYONIZEYE
WASN'T SNAPPING ORDINARY
PICTURES.
SHE WAS USING A TECHNIQUE CALLED

25:04.035 --> 25:11.209
PHOTOGRAMMETRY TO GET BETTER
MEASUREMENTS OF GORILLA SIZE.
>> Nadia Niyonizeye: THERE ARE
FOUR CENTIMETER IN BETWEEN EACH.

25:11.276 --> 25:18.617
>> Stahl: BY BEAMING LASERS ONTO
THE GORILLA'S BODY AND HEAD,
WHICH IT DOESN'T FEEL.
>> Stahl: OH, I SEE IT.

25:18.683 --> 25:24.322
BACK AT THE OFFICE, SHE USES THE
DOTS TO MAKE PRECISE
CALCULATIONS OF THEIR SIZE.
SCIENCE REMAINS THE HEART OF THE

25:24.389 --> 25:31.763
FOSSEY FUND'S MISSION.
THEY HAVE THE LARGEST COLLECTION
ANYWHERE OF GORILLA SKELETONS,
WHERE SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE

25:31.830 --> 25:37.435
WORLD COME TO DO RESEARCH.
>> Stoinski: JUST SORT OF TAKING
PIECES OUT AND PULLING IT LIKE
THAT.

25:37.502 --> 25:42.707
>> Stahl: AND A GORILLA POOP
LAB.
YOU GATHER THEIR POOP?
>> Stoinski: IT'S LIKE A

25:42.774 --> 25:46.878
TREASURE TROVE OF INFORMATION
FOR US.
>> Stahl: TO STUDY STRESS
HORMONES AND DO D.N.A. AND

25:46.945 --> 25:54.519
PATERNITY TESTING.
BUT STOINSKI SAYS THEY'RE
RUNNING OUT OF SPACE, SO THEY'RE
CONSTRUCTING A NEW, MULTI-

25:54.586 --> 26:01.960
BUILDING GREEN CAMPUS WITH
INITIAL FUNDING FROM ELLEN
DEGENERES.
SET TO OPEN NEXT YEAR, IT'LL

26:02.027 --> 26:11.503
CELEBRATE THE PROGRESS MADE IN
SAVING MOUNTAIN GORILLAS-- WITH
PLENTY OF SPACE FOR RESEARCHERS,
EXHIBITS FOR TOURISTS AND PEOPLE

26:11.569 --> 26:16.541
FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES-- AND
VIEWS OF THE VOLCANOES.
AND YOU CAN SEE THE MIST.
>> Stoinski: IT REALLY ROLLS IN.

26:16.608 --> 26:24.049
>> Stahl: THE BUILDING PROCESS
ITSELF REINFORCES THE FUND'S
MOTTO: "HELPING PEOPLE SAVING
GORILLAS."

26:24.115 --> 26:32.524
IT'S EMPLOYING MORE THAN 1,500
LOCAL WORKERS, MORE THAN 20% OF
THEM WOMEN.
ONE EXHIBIT ON DISPLAY HERE WILL

26:32.590 --> 26:36.294
TEACH VISITORS TO SPEAK LIKE A
GORILLA.
>> Stoinski: WE CAN PLAY IT.
>> WELCOME TO GORILLA CHAT.

26:36.361 --> 26:42.467
>> Stoinski: YOU CAN HEAR.
>> WE'RE HAPPY THAT YOU WANT TO
LEARN TO SPEAK LIKE A GORILLA.
>> Stahl: IT PLAYS GORILLA

26:42.534 --> 26:48.606
VOCALIZATIONS SOMEWHAT
COMPARABLE TO HUMAN ONES.
(<i> GORILLA LAUGHING SOUND</i> )
>> Stahl: YES, GORILLAS LAUGH.

26:48.673 --> 26:55.480
>> Stoinski: ISN'T THAT GREAT?
SO, THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE TO
TRY AND MIMIC IT.
>> Stahl: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

26:55.547 --> 26:59.551
SHE GAVE ME ONE SHE SAID WAS
SIMPLE.
(<i> GORILLA NOISE</i> )
>> Stoinski: SO, THIS IS THE PIG

26:59.617 --> 27:02.954
GRUNT.
>> Stahl: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
>> Stoinski: IT'S KIND OF LIKE A
MILD WARNING.

27:03.021 --> 27:06.524
THE SORT OF HUMAN VERSION IS,
"UNH-UNH-UNH."
>> Stahl: YOU'RE ON THIN ICE.
>> Stoinski: YOU WANT TO TRY IT

27:06.591 --> 27:10.362
WITH ME RECORDING AND SEE?
>> Stahl: YEAH.
>> Stoinski: OKAY.
(<i> BEEPS</i> )

27:10.428 --> 27:19.204

>> Stoinski: AGAIN.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.173
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: I DID SUCH A BAD JOB.
>> Stoinski: IT'S HARD.
>> Stahl: SO FUN.

27:22.240 --> 27:28.046
>> Stoinski: WON'T IT BE FUN,
THOUGH?
>> Stahl: STOINSKI WANTS SCHOOL
KIDS TO COME, AND BE INSPIRED TO

27:28.113 --> 27:34.819
SOLVE THE NEXT SET OF PROBLEMS--
INCREASING NUMBERS OF GORILLAS
INHABITING A FIXED AMOUNT OF
SPACE.

27:34.886 --> 27:40.425
>> Stoinski: AS THE POPULATION
HAS INCREASED, BUT THE HABITAT
HASN'T, IT IS PUTTING MORE
PRESSURE ON THE GORILLAS.

27:40.492 --> 27:46.931
AND SO THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING
TO TRY AND EXPAND THE PARK SO
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE SPACE SO
THAT POPULATION CAN CONTINUE TO

27:46.998 --> 27:55.774
GROW.
>> Stahl: THERE ARE PLANS TO
EXPAND THE PARK BY 23%, AND
RELOCATE COMMUNITIES TO WHAT THE

27:55.840 --> 28:01.780
GOVERNMENT CALLS MODEL VILLAGES
LIKE THIS ONE, WITH ELECTRICITY
AND BRAND-NEW SCHOOLS, TRYING TO
MAKE PARK EXPANSION ANOTHER WIN-

28:01.846 --> 28:08.453
WIN FOR GORILLAS AND THEIR HUMAN
NEIGHBORS.
IT'S A SUCCESS STORY.
>> Stoinski: IT IS A SUCCESS

28:08.520 --> 28:13.858
STORY, DEFINITELY, BUT WE SAY
IT'S A FRAGILE SUCCESS BECAUSE
THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM LEFT
AND THERE ARE STILL SO MANY

28:13.925 --> 28:21.766
THREATS.
>> Stahl: BUT FOR NOW, THE NEWS
IS GOOD.
SO FAR THIS YEAR, 24 NEW BABY

28:21.833 --> 28:27.338
GORILLAS HAVE BEEN BORN HERE.
>> Uwingeli: WOW, I MEAN, YOU
CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF TELLING
THOSE STORIES OF GORILLAS-- WHEN

28:27.405 --> 28:34.412
YOU LOOK AT THE MOMS CARRYING
THE BABIES--
>> Stahl: DO YOU KNOW THAT WHEN
YOU TALK ABOUT GORILLAS, YOUR

28:34.479 --> 28:40.051
FACE COMPLETELY LIGHTS UP?
>> Uwingeli: I KNOW ABOUT IT,
BUT MUCH OF THE SMILE COMES FROM
WHAT THEY'RE HELPING US TO

28:40.118 --> 28:47.392
ACHIEVE.
THAT'S REALLY THE BEST WAY WE
CAN SERVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF
KIDS, GORILLAS.

28:47.459 --> 28:52.130
>> Stahl: OH, MY GOODNESS!
>> Uwingeli: ...AND-- AND-- AND
PEOPLE.
