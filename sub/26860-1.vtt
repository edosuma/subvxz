WEBVTT

01:32.437 --> 01:34.715
- Are you
crazy, this is spring,

01:34.749 --> 01:37.131
it's not the season
for pine cones.

01:38.305 --> 01:39.547
- Hocus
pocus, egg of toad,

01:39.582 --> 01:42.240
to me white cloud
now quickly float.

01:42.274 --> 01:46.313
Draw together open up,
hunus, punus, fill our cup.

02:07.334 --> 02:09.957
Clothespins, eh, okay.

02:09.991 --> 02:11.890
Not what I meant.

02:11.924 --> 02:16.481
- Why not make it rain something
yummy instead, breadcrumbs?

02:16.515 --> 02:18.241
Oh, raisins.

02:18.276 --> 02:20.968
- I just don't get it,
an ordinary rain spell

02:21.002 --> 02:22.970
shouldn't be this tricky.

02:23.833 --> 02:25.145
All right, I'll try again.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.906
- And I shall take cover.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.323
- Hocus pocus large in
size, to me white cloud

02:31.358 --> 02:35.085
now quickly rise, draw
together I shall offer,

02:36.225 --> 02:41.195
uh, legal-a-loggoly,
make the ground softer.

02:53.759 --> 02:55.934
- What
are you, a magpie?

02:58.212 --> 03:00.525
Shiny spoons, woo-hoo-hoo.

03:01.905 --> 03:05.633
Oh dear, help me.

03:05.668 --> 03:07.566
- At least a ladle's
kind of practical.

03:07.601 --> 03:09.913
- I'd much prefer a
woolen cap, thank you.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.989
- I wanna go inside now.

03:19.475 --> 03:20.717
- What's the matter?

03:20.752 --> 03:22.029
- Nothing.

03:23.444 --> 03:26.240
- You're upset about tonight's
Walpurgis dance, aren't you?

03:57.582 --> 03:59.480
You weren't invited
to Brocken Mountain

03:59.515 --> 04:01.862
again this year and
your feelings are hurt.

04:04.209 --> 04:07.626
Well you do realize that
they have very strict rules.

04:07.661 --> 04:11.112
Walpurgis night is only
for the big witches.

04:11.147 --> 04:15.047
At 127, you're still
considered a little witch.

04:15.082 --> 04:18.154
- 127 years, two
months, and 22 days.

04:19.569 --> 04:23.849
It's just not fair, I wanna
dance on Brocken Mountain too.

04:23.884 --> 04:28.647
- They'll invite you some day
I'm sure of it, be patient.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.341
- What if I just flew
up there in secret?

04:33.514 --> 04:34.653
If they've already
started dancing

04:34.688 --> 04:36.206
they wouldn't even notice me.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.004
- That's a horrible idea,
what if they catch you?

04:42.385 --> 04:45.526
They may ban you, and you'll
never go, and then what?

04:47.356 --> 04:48.667
- Do you think they would?

04:56.503 --> 04:58.884
- Walpurgis night sounds
like a lot of fun,

04:58.919 --> 05:01.093
if you have an
invitation, that is.

05:01.128 --> 05:03.993
I don't
advise taking the risk.

05:16.454 --> 05:19.836
Please be patient, there's
always the possibility

05:19.871 --> 05:22.287
that you'll be invited
to join next year,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.565
or the year after that.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.225
- Be patient,
but for how long?

05:41.237 --> 05:42.480
- Move
it you.

05:42.514 --> 05:43.895
- Thomas, wait up.

05:54.561 --> 05:57.115
- It's Walpurgis night you know.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.807
- Let the witches dance,
they don't scare me.

06:03.052 --> 06:05.503
How can you tell if
someone's a witch?

06:05.537 --> 06:09.265
- Well, they're
really old and really ugly,

06:09.299 --> 06:11.060
and they just look wicked.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.649
- Have you ever seen a witch?

06:14.822 --> 06:17.238
- Of course not,
and if I'm lucky,

06:17.273 --> 06:18.930
I'll never see one either.

07:19.093 --> 07:23.512
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.520
- Rock candy.

09:02.818 --> 09:04.578
- We celebrate
Walpurgis night,

09:04.613 --> 09:06.580
every witch's pure delight,

09:06.615 --> 09:08.582
many here shall be inspired,

09:08.617 --> 09:10.584
to spin around
the witches' fire.

09:10.619 --> 09:12.517
Sing and dance
and act all right,

09:12.552 --> 09:15.071
this is our Walpurgis night.

10:55.551 --> 10:57.139
- Hello, Aunt Rumpumpel.

10:57.173 --> 10:59.313
- So you want to dance
here with us, do you?

10:59.348 --> 11:00.142
- I'd love to.

11:02.523 --> 11:05.319
- You know, little witches
like you are forbidden

11:05.354 --> 11:08.944
from coming here tonight
under any circumstances.

11:08.978 --> 11:10.877
- Yes, I know, but
if you don't tell,

11:10.911 --> 11:12.292
it can just be our secret.

11:17.021 --> 11:18.988
- It seems we have a visitor.

11:19.023 --> 11:22.336
- Whoa.

11:22.371 --> 11:24.097
- Who?
- Who is that?

11:24.131 --> 11:26.202
- It's my little niece.

11:27.410 --> 11:30.172
287 times removed, that is.

11:30.206 --> 11:31.691
- I've never seen her.

11:39.595 --> 11:44.013
- How
old is she, anyway?

11:44.048 --> 11:46.844
- 127 years, two
months, and 22 days.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.674
- So young!

11:49.709 --> 11:52.125
- 127 years, you say?

11:56.439 --> 11:59.822
How dare you show your
face here tonight.

12:01.306 --> 12:03.861
A witch of your young age
is explicitly forbidden

12:03.895 --> 12:06.346
from dancing on Walpurgis night.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.038
- I'm sorry but, I was
so curious, I just had to

12:09.073 --> 12:10.660
jump on my broom and fly over.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.317
- She just had too.

12:12.352 --> 12:13.802
- Is she serious?

12:13.836 --> 12:15.458
- Hop on your broom and
fly back home Little Witch

12:15.493 --> 12:17.150
before I get mean.

12:17.184 --> 12:18.427
- But I--

12:18.461 --> 12:21.188
- No buts, and don't let
me catch you here again.

12:31.474 --> 12:34.374
- And, what about next
year, can I come back then?

12:34.408 --> 12:35.237
- What?

12:37.826 --> 12:41.622
- Hm, well if you work hard
and become a good witch,

12:41.657 --> 12:43.314
then I'll consider it.

12:43.348 --> 12:44.142
- Really?

12:44.177 --> 12:45.385
- Perhaps.

12:45.419 --> 12:47.594
- Then I shall become a
good witch, I promise.

12:47.628 --> 12:51.011
- It will never work,
just take one look at her.

12:51.046 --> 12:55.326
- She's far too thin, she
smells far too good, uh?

12:55.360 --> 12:57.777
- How small she
is, way too small.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.330
- And she's stupid as well.

12:59.364 --> 13:00.607
- I'm not stupid,

13:00.641 --> 13:02.816
I'll be as good a
witch as any of you.

13:02.851 --> 13:06.061
- Whoa!
- We shall see about that!

13:06.095 --> 13:09.340
In one year, on the
night before Walpurgis,

13:09.374 --> 13:11.514
I shall assemble a
council of witches,

13:11.549 --> 13:14.000
and we will put you to the test.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.518
- Um.
- Um-hm.

13:15.553 --> 13:17.417
- We will then find out
if you have what it takes

13:17.451 --> 13:19.799
to be a truly great
witch, you agree?

13:19.833 --> 13:20.661
- Mm-hm.

13:22.111 --> 13:27.116
- And if you should fail,
well, you'll be banned

13:28.186 --> 13:30.119
from celebrating
Walpurgis night forever.

13:30.154 --> 13:30.982
- Yes, yes.

13:32.363 --> 13:34.365
- The book.

13:49.276 --> 13:50.830
- What's this?

13:50.864 --> 13:55.835
- Hm, in this book, all the
things good witches know awaits.

13:56.490 --> 13:57.975
- Mm-hm.

13:58.009 --> 14:02.255
- One year from now, you
must show flawless mastery

14:02.289 --> 14:06.224
of every last spell therein,
if you wish to pass.

14:06.259 --> 14:08.330
Do you understand?

14:09.503 --> 14:14.129
- Yeah, sure do, I'll
start studying tomorrow.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.822
I'll be a good
witch, I know I will.

14:18.685 --> 14:19.582
I'll show you.

14:19.617 --> 14:22.723
- Not so fast, a moment please.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.106
Will she not be punished
for this violation?

14:26.141 --> 14:29.523
- We all know the
rules, anyone who comes

14:29.558 --> 14:32.561
to the witches' dance
without an invitation

14:32.595 --> 14:35.736
must be punished, that is true.

14:35.771 --> 14:38.981
- Give her to me, I'll bury
her up to her neck in mud.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.053
- Let's make her lie
in a bed of coals

14:42.088 --> 14:45.022
for three days and three nights.

14:45.056 --> 14:45.885
- Quiet!

14:46.886 --> 14:49.371
Such venom and ire.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.996
So, what should we say?

14:54.031 --> 14:59.036
- Yes, I would suggest that we
take away her witches broom.

15:00.761 --> 15:05.490
That means she'll be forced
to walk three days and nights

15:05.525 --> 15:10.530
step by step by torturous
step just to get home.

15:14.258 --> 15:16.777
- Very good, that's
what we'll say.

15:18.331 --> 15:19.953
- Give
me your broom.

15:19.988 --> 15:20.850
- But.

15:30.481 --> 15:32.759
- Be gone, boo!

15:39.835 --> 15:42.148
- I'd keep an eye
on her through this,

15:42.182 --> 15:44.564
she still has much to learn.

16:55.462 --> 16:58.948
- Oh, can't forget
the book, come on.

17:25.699 --> 17:28.012
- Come on,
where have you been?

17:28.047 --> 17:31.119
What happened to you,
where's your broom?

17:31.153 --> 17:34.398
- The sparks were flying, and
the drums were banging so loud

17:34.432 --> 17:36.607
and the witches were
dancing like crazy.

17:36.641 --> 17:38.781
The bonfire was giant, Abraxas,

17:38.816 --> 17:40.093
oh I wish you could've seen it.

17:40.128 --> 17:40.990
- Mm-hm.

17:42.199 --> 17:43.821
- I think I could've
danced all night.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.374
- But they caught you instead.

17:45.409 --> 17:47.342
- Unfortunately,
now I have to learn

17:47.376 --> 17:49.068
that whole book as punishment.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.724
- That's
not a punishment,

17:50.759 --> 17:53.520
it's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

17:53.555 --> 17:55.108
- How is it an opportunity?

17:56.868 --> 18:00.458
7,892 spells of
memorization is good how?

18:00.493 --> 18:03.530
- It'll be hard work that's
true, but if you want to be

18:03.565 --> 18:06.119
a great witch, it'll
take sacrifice.

18:07.293 --> 18:11.435
- Yeah, so I'll work,
every day for seven,

18:11.469 --> 18:12.850
eight hours at least.

18:14.403 --> 18:17.199
But first I'll get
revenge, on Rumpumpel,

18:17.234 --> 18:18.407
that ugly old thing.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.411
- So, what's your plan?

18:28.107 --> 18:31.524
- I'm gonna give her
a big fat pig snout.

18:31.558 --> 18:34.837
Some horns.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.811
And a nice flowing
goat's beard on her chin.

18:46.711 --> 18:50.646
And on her gigantic
behind, a big horses tail.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.718
- None of this is true revenge.

18:53.753 --> 18:55.168
- Oh?

18:55.203 --> 18:56.825
- Since Rumpumpel is an
older witch, she can dispel

18:56.859 --> 19:00.622
all these small charms
without even batting her eye.

19:00.656 --> 19:04.384
If you really want to take
revenge on old Rumpumpel,

19:04.419 --> 19:06.352
you must become a
better witch than she.

19:06.386 --> 19:08.802
And you should begin right now.

19:08.837 --> 19:09.976
- Like right now?

19:10.010 --> 19:11.219
- Immediately.

19:19.848 --> 19:21.953
- Fundamentals of
black witchcraft.

19:28.305 --> 19:31.963
First, the elements.

19:34.966 --> 19:38.556
The spells on conjuring wind,
I think I can handle that.

19:43.872 --> 19:47.047
Ventalas ventalas vantalus
voontalus verivox,

19:47.082 --> 19:49.222
verifoox voorufex hexorex.

19:52.743 --> 19:57.610
Ventalas ventalas
vantalus

19:57.644 --> 19:59.163
voontul, vontafex?

20:00.889 --> 20:04.824
And then it's something
like veritvex, verihex.

20:10.519 --> 20:11.486
Ought-oh.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.349
- What's wrong?

20:14.627 --> 20:16.422
- Must've been the wrong spell.

20:16.456 --> 20:18.596
- Wrong spell, what do you mean?

20:20.011 --> 20:23.429
Take them
away, get rid of them now.

20:24.602 --> 20:26.880
- That spell is way too
complex, and the wind

20:26.915 --> 20:28.951
doesn't need my
help to blow anyhow.

20:28.986 --> 20:32.196
Invoke ball lightning,
cause avalanches,

20:32.231 --> 20:36.027
release a firestorm, but
what about dirty dishes?

20:36.062 --> 20:38.858
Or mending socks,
something useful.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.205
- Can you please just
get rid of these ears?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.450
- They look good
on you.

20:44.484 --> 20:48.143
Ears, ears, ah, ears,
rabbits, counter-spell,

20:50.318 --> 20:52.630
conversio, that's it, mm-hm.

20:54.114 --> 20:55.392
Vari verihex.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.019
Why are you laughing?

21:03.848 --> 21:04.677
Oh dear.

21:05.816 --> 21:09.509
- I think they look
good on you.

21:21.521 --> 21:24.766
- Ventavus ventavus
ventavus voontavos,

21:26.699 --> 21:29.149
uh, that's not right.

21:29.184 --> 21:34.189
Varibooks varivox.

21:35.777 --> 21:39.470
These spells are too complicated
and that book is too big.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.508
How am I suppose
to get through it?

21:47.961 --> 21:51.655
What are you looking for,
did you lose something?

21:51.689 --> 21:54.278
- We're looking for
firewood, but there's nothing

21:54.313 --> 21:58.731
on the ground, no branches,
no twigs, nothing.

21:58.765 --> 22:00.422
- What do you mean, nothing?

22:00.457 --> 22:02.735
- There's
been no wind, and no wind

22:02.769 --> 22:05.703
means nothing's been
falling from the trees.

22:07.291 --> 22:09.431
- I'd love
to know magic right now.

22:09.466 --> 22:10.984
- Well
you don't, and why,

22:11.019 --> 22:13.159
it won't help anything.

22:13.193 --> 22:16.024
- Ventavus ventavus
vantuvus voontavus

22:16.058 --> 22:18.716
verivox verivoox ruafex hexarex.

22:34.594 --> 22:36.216
- Take cover.

22:36.251 --> 22:38.805
- Your
handkerchief, I'll get it.

23:00.689 --> 23:03.382
- That's enough,
stop it, enough.

23:19.984 --> 23:20.882
- Ah, look.

23:20.916 --> 23:23.367
- Huh, I guess I can conjure.

23:25.507 --> 23:27.026
Wind's a good start.
- Blunderbust,

23:27.060 --> 23:30.650
thunder tindrums, lead and
hail, what are you doing?

23:30.685 --> 23:33.446
You know you can't
collect firewood here.

23:33.481 --> 23:35.655
- How else are we suppose
to heat our stoves?

23:35.690 --> 23:38.417
- That's not my problem,
empty your baskets right now.

23:39.521 --> 23:40.626
Come on, let's go.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.597
- Please, Mr. Forester,
show some mercy.

23:46.632 --> 23:47.909
We're not hurting anyone.

23:47.943 --> 23:50.429
- That is not the
issue, there are rules.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.258
Now empty that basket.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.020
- You should stay away from me.

23:57.953 --> 24:02.026
- So, you wanna resist,
I oughta lock you up

24:02.061 --> 24:06.928
for obstructing an officer
and, and, and I would be

24:06.962 --> 24:10.034
happy to let you keep
however much wood you need.

24:10.069 --> 24:12.243
Did I
really just say that?

24:12.278 --> 24:13.762
- Thank you for
being so agreeable,

24:13.797 --> 24:16.213
I just wish these
baskets weren't so heavy.

24:17.386 --> 24:19.734
- Oh for goodness sake,
I should take you in

24:19.768 --> 24:21.805
for whatever nonsense
you're trying to pull here.

24:21.839 --> 24:25.912
But, first I should carry that
heavy basket home for you.

24:25.947 --> 24:27.569
Why would I wanna do that?

24:27.604 --> 24:28.881
- You really mean it?

24:28.915 --> 24:31.366
- No, I mean, oh sure.

24:33.713 --> 24:35.335
- Here you go.

24:35.370 --> 24:40.375
- Blunderbus,
thunder tindrums, lead and hail,

24:45.104 --> 24:48.314
and if you want, I can
carry you if it's easier.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.902
Really?

24:49.936 --> 24:52.629
- Definitely not, I mean, yeah.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.017
- Giddy up bye!

25:11.026 --> 25:16.031
Let's go little donkey,
move it.

25:18.102 --> 25:21.071
Come on little
donkey, hurry, yah!

25:23.383 --> 25:27.042
- Bluderbust, thunder
tindrums, lead and hail--

25:27.077 --> 25:30.149
- Whoa, you can set
me back down now.

25:32.220 --> 25:37.225
Hep!

25:38.433 --> 25:41.056
Well that was nice,
now run along home.

25:42.368 --> 25:44.232
You must be the nicest
forester in the world.

25:44.266 --> 25:45.923
- Uh-huh.

25:45.958 --> 25:48.650
- And you'll let the women gather
wood in peace from now on?

25:48.685 --> 25:49.548
- Yes.

25:51.446 --> 25:56.451
- Hm, he's
not gonna forget that.

26:08.187 --> 26:10.534
- You
should've seen him,

26:10.569 --> 26:12.260
all swearing and sweating.

26:13.468 --> 26:15.539
- It was good of you to
help those poor women,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.715
but was it necessary to torture
the forester like that, hm?

26:19.716 --> 26:21.131
- Yeah, of course.

26:21.165 --> 26:22.339
- But why?

26:22.373 --> 26:24.790
- Because it was fun,
I help good people

26:24.824 --> 26:25.756
by punishing bad ones.

26:25.791 --> 26:27.309
- Is that so?

26:27.344 --> 26:29.380
Do you really think that's
how a good witch behaves?

26:29.415 --> 26:32.798
Couldn't you do good without
all the tricks and shenanigans?

26:32.832 --> 26:34.489
- That sounds boring.

26:34.523 --> 26:38.424
- Boring, well it
doesn't have to be.

26:59.445 --> 27:02.206
You know what, sometimes
I get the feeling

27:02.241 --> 27:04.692
that you don't want
to be a good witch.

27:04.726 --> 27:06.590
- Well, that's how I get to
dance on Brocken Mountain,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.040
so of course I want that.

27:08.074 --> 27:10.076
- Then I think it's about
time that you started

27:10.111 --> 27:13.183
acting like that's what
you want, don't you agree?

27:17.946 --> 27:20.328
- How am I suppose to know
what's good and what's not?

27:20.362 --> 27:22.330
- It's not something
that you know,

27:22.364 --> 27:24.159
it's something that you feel.

27:26.058 --> 27:29.302
You have to listen to the
voice deep inside yourself,

27:29.337 --> 27:30.165
you'll feel it.

27:59.229 --> 28:00.575
- Run, and take your girl

28:00.609 --> 28:01.783
drums with you.
- Go play with your dolls.

28:01.818 --> 28:03.336
- We don't want
you little sissies.

28:03.371 --> 28:05.304
- Thanks for our new cart.

28:07.651 --> 28:08.825
Yeah!

28:08.859 --> 28:10.067
- Let's break it.

28:11.103 --> 28:12.345
- Why are you doing that?

28:12.380 --> 28:13.830
- Because it's fun.

28:13.864 --> 28:15.659
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.595
Stop staring, and stop
asking stupid questions.

28:23.771 --> 28:25.393
Cut it out, let's go.

28:41.616 --> 28:45.137
- Thank you kindly,
No-frills Jacob, now open.

28:45.171 --> 28:49.382
I've got fantastic

28:49.417 --> 28:51.660
exquisite supplies
for the gentlemen,

28:51.695 --> 28:56.700
and great, great lotions.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.188
I'm feeling generous today
folks, almost giving it away.

29:02.223 --> 29:05.433
Suspenders, razor
blades, this big bottle

29:05.467 --> 29:07.676
of healthy garlic
juice for dirt cheap.

29:07.711 --> 29:11.059
Step right up, I've got
bargains you can't beat.

29:11.094 --> 29:14.097
That'll be five sir, thank you,
you got yourself a bargain.

29:14.131 --> 29:17.410
The finest goods from No-frills
Jacob, whatever you need.

29:17.445 --> 29:18.826
- How much for these?

29:18.860 --> 29:21.725
- For you my dear, just
three, no, make it two, okay.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.900
Step right up people,
you'll be glad you did.

29:23.934 --> 29:26.247
I've got flags, yarn, and ink.

29:27.731 --> 29:29.595
- Thank you.

29:29.629 --> 29:31.424
- I hope they serve
you well, ma'am.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.429
No-frills Jacob,
open for business.

29:36.464 --> 29:38.811
I've got just what you
need at the price you need.

29:52.652 --> 29:54.275
- Hello there.

29:54.309 --> 29:55.138
- Hello.

29:59.867 --> 30:00.695
Mm!

30:02.283 --> 30:03.836
Anything else, ma'am?

30:03.871 --> 30:05.010
- No thank you.

30:05.044 --> 30:06.701
- Mama, will you
buy us a candy cane,

30:06.735 --> 30:09.704
or a rock candy
please, just one?

30:09.738 --> 30:11.948
- Not today Vroni,
some other time dear.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.847
- That will be 8.70
please, thank you.

30:19.714 --> 30:21.198
- Let me
help you with that.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.995
- I need a broom, please.

30:25.030 --> 30:28.585
- A hand broom, a kitchen
broom, or perhaps a birch broom?

30:28.619 --> 30:30.242
Maybe a scrubbing brush.

30:30.276 --> 30:32.969
I also have many feather
dusters to choose from.

30:33.003 --> 30:35.074
- Just a simple birch broom.

30:35.109 --> 30:37.801
- Ah, with or
without a broomstick.

30:39.182 --> 30:42.150
- With, I mean, the stick's
the most crucial part.

30:42.185 --> 30:45.913
- Here you go, my
finest quality broom.

30:56.993 --> 31:00.789
- Very nice, oh, and a large
bag of rock candy, please.

31:09.729 --> 31:10.558
A little more.

31:13.630 --> 31:14.803
Oh, and a candy cane.

31:15.874 --> 31:20.671
- Ah, mm, okay, that'll
be 9.80, please.

31:26.091 --> 31:28.472
- Oh, keep the
change, thank you.

31:29.335 --> 31:30.578
- Thank you.

31:30.612 --> 31:31.441
- Mm-hm.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.574
- Miss, handmade paper flower?

32:02.990 --> 32:07.477
Flowers, handmade
paper flowers, flowers.

32:08.892 --> 32:12.068
- You have so many lovely
flowers, I like them.

32:12.102 --> 32:16.658
- Yeah, I made them all
myself but no one wants one.

32:19.178 --> 32:20.007
- May I?

32:28.877 --> 32:31.087
But their fragrance
smells so good.

32:31.121 --> 32:32.019
Their fragrance?

32:32.053 --> 32:32.951
- It smells sweet.

32:36.678 --> 32:37.956
- You're right.

32:42.719 --> 32:44.445
- What is that smell?

32:47.034 --> 32:49.933
- It smells magical.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.350
- Over there, I think
it's those paper flowers.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.460
- One flower, please.

32:59.494 --> 33:01.013
- I want one too.

33:01.048 --> 33:02.773
- Two please, one for
me and one for my sister.

33:02.808 --> 33:04.741
- I'll buy a couple!

33:14.061 --> 33:15.752
- Notice something weird?

33:15.786 --> 33:18.375
- Yeah, she's not
running out of flowers.

33:21.896 --> 33:25.417
- Hey, hey, excuse me,
can you save me a flower?

33:28.592 --> 33:31.112
Your, your flowers
are quite beautiful.

33:43.090 --> 33:46.679
- Now, you're going to be
my witch's broom, okay.

33:59.623 --> 34:01.073
See, being good can be fun.

34:01.108 --> 34:03.144
Eh, why are you acting up?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.771
That was close.

34:09.806 --> 34:12.083
I'm guessing that
one flips up over and

34:12.119 --> 34:15.190
I wonder what'll
happen if I do this!

34:19.540 --> 34:20.610
Woo-hoo, woo!

34:58.165 --> 35:01.720
Woo, now that's cold.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.601
- Oh, I'm
roasting out here.

35:20.635 --> 35:24.018
- Ah,
this is so boring.

35:24.052 --> 35:25.640
Should I cast some spells?

35:25.675 --> 35:29.023
- On a Friday,
on Friday, spells are--

35:29.057 --> 35:30.335
- Forbidden, I know.

35:34.304 --> 35:36.203
Well what about an
itty, bitty spell?

35:36.237 --> 35:38.205
- If you're willing to risk
getting caught, then go

35:38.239 --> 35:41.725
right ahead, but we'll see if
you dance on Brocken Mountain.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.626
- It's such a stupid
rule, no magic on Fridays.

35:45.660 --> 35:48.870
I don't understand it, why
not cast spells on a Friday?

36:12.273 --> 36:15.034
- I think we've
been here before.

36:16.139 --> 36:17.554
- Okay, that way?

36:42.924 --> 36:43.787
- Hm?

36:44.995 --> 36:47.653
- Oh, hey.

36:47.688 --> 36:49.068
Oh dear.

36:49.103 --> 36:50.311
- No one's home.

36:51.795 --> 36:52.624
- Hello.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.801
Are you kids lost?

36:57.836 --> 36:58.664
- No.
- Yeah.

37:02.116 --> 37:03.704
- Come on, I won't bite.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.919
How 'bout a bite to eat,
I'll go see what I have.

37:11.953 --> 37:14.887
- It's her, that
lady from the market.

37:49.197 --> 37:50.647
- What's that?

37:50.682 --> 37:52.787
- It's a snouted, horned,
horse-tailed goat witch.

37:52.822 --> 37:53.685
Whatda you think?

37:55.307 --> 37:57.136
- I don't know.

37:57.171 --> 37:58.310
- I kinda like it.

37:59.587 --> 38:01.382
- How about some cocoa and cake?

38:08.941 --> 38:10.184
Good?

38:10.218 --> 38:11.012
- Mm-hm.

38:11.047 --> 38:11.875
- Yeah.

38:14.809 --> 38:16.259
- Can I ask you something?

38:17.433 --> 38:18.606
- You can ask anything.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.092
- Are you a witch?

38:22.127 --> 38:22.955
- Vroni.

38:24.716 --> 38:26.234
- So, are you or not?

38:26.269 --> 38:30.169
- Uh, I'm sorry about that,
she's not trying to be rude.

38:30.204 --> 38:32.517
Of course you're not a witch.

38:32.551 --> 38:33.380
- Oh no?

38:34.519 --> 38:37.384
- Obviously, you're not
mean or ugly or old.

38:37.418 --> 38:39.178
And you can't cast
spells either.

38:43.666 --> 38:44.874
Hey, I want down.

38:44.908 --> 38:45.875
- So you really
are a witch then.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.463
- Will you please put me down?

38:47.497 --> 38:48.947
- What else can you do?

38:48.981 --> 38:50.362
What would you like?

38:50.397 --> 38:53.779
- Are you mad, have you
forgotten what day it is, well?

38:53.814 --> 38:55.540
- The bird can talk?

38:55.574 --> 38:57.265
- Is he an enchanted prince?

38:57.300 --> 38:59.406
- He's no prince, Abraxas
is an old know it all

38:59.440 --> 39:01.511
who's scared to leave the house.

39:01.546 --> 39:02.719
- What's his deal?

39:02.754 --> 39:04.134
- Probably nothing, but
don't you think it'd

39:04.169 --> 39:05.722
be nice if he
closed the curtains.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.314
- Can I come down already?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.419
- Sure, sorry about that.

39:13.730 --> 39:14.938
- Ohh.

39:16.008 --> 39:17.044
- Any requests?

39:18.114 --> 39:19.805
- Put the table on the ceiling.

39:31.472 --> 39:32.680
- Don't mind that.

39:32.715 --> 39:34.751
- Fill the bathtub
with milk and honey.

39:57.187 --> 39:58.844
- And what about you,
is there something

39:58.879 --> 40:00.259
that you'd like to see?

40:07.059 --> 40:08.647
- Make the stove play a song.

40:08.682 --> 40:10.408
- I see, playtime.

41:20.547 --> 41:21.409
Hello?

41:28.451 --> 41:29.452
Who are you?

41:40.083 --> 41:43.052
Rumpumpel, what a nice surprise.

41:43.086 --> 41:46.883
- I was nearby, so I
thought I'd pop in.

41:46.918 --> 41:49.748
- That's nice, I'm kind
of right in the middle of

41:49.783 --> 41:51.336
cleaning at the moment, so--

41:51.370 --> 41:55.271
- I don't mind, just checking
on how your studies are going.

41:55.305 --> 41:58.757
- Good, very good, actually.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.034
- Good, good,

42:06.972 --> 42:10.424
very good indeed.

42:18.052 --> 42:20.227
What's with the curtain
and those shutters

42:20.261 --> 42:22.505
over there being drawn?

42:22.540 --> 42:26.095
- Oh it's because
it's hot outside.

42:27.510 --> 42:29.236
- I see, the heat.

42:40.247 --> 42:41.697
Eh!

42:41.731 --> 42:44.734
- Uh, well that makes
it easier to clean.

42:48.220 --> 42:50.533
- Were you casting spells?

42:50.568 --> 42:53.122
- I'd never do such
a thing on a Friday.

42:53.156 --> 42:55.538
You know spells are
forbidden today, don't you?

42:55.573 --> 42:57.057
- Don't get cute with me.

42:58.645 --> 42:59.473
- Sorry.

43:03.650 --> 43:05.962
- Do you
have visitors right now?

43:05.997 --> 43:07.239
- No.

43:07.274 --> 43:10.380
- You wouldn't happen to
be entertaining humans?

43:14.592 --> 43:17.733
We witches are to
keep away from humans,

43:17.767 --> 43:20.908
you know that's
forbidden too, don't you?

43:20.943 --> 43:22.772
- Of course,
that's common knowledge.

43:22.807 --> 43:24.429
What's that?

43:25.568 --> 43:29.261
- Um, I like to
draw, it's relaxing.

43:30.504 --> 43:32.817
- Well, uh-uh, it's not bad.

43:37.891 --> 43:38.892
You have talent, hm.

43:48.626 --> 43:49.834
Honey?

43:51.870 --> 43:55.287
- Yep, it's good for the skin,
you should try it sometime.

43:55.322 --> 43:58.325
- Why, is something
wrong with my skin?

43:59.257 --> 44:02.570
Oh, you mean warts.

44:02.605 --> 44:03.986
- Achoo!

44:05.608 --> 44:06.644
- Is someone here?

44:06.678 --> 44:09.439
- No, that was, achoo, me.

44:09.474 --> 44:11.890
This time of year
always gives me, achoo,

44:11.925 --> 44:15.514
terrible hay fever, it gets
worse, achoo, each year.

44:15.549 --> 44:19.277
I just can't see to, achoo,
shake it off.

44:24.696 --> 44:26.491
- Get that away,
you'd better count

44:26.525 --> 44:29.632
your lucky stars it's
Friday, or else I'd--

44:29.667 --> 44:30.909
- Cut it out, Abraxas.

44:34.223 --> 44:39.055
- What did you call him, that
charbroiled chicken there?

44:39.090 --> 44:41.230
- He's Abraxas, he's my raven.

44:41.264 --> 44:43.232
He gets in the way
when I'm cleaning

44:43.266 --> 44:44.854
so I put him in the cupboard.

44:44.889 --> 44:49.756
- You know, that we true witches,
our pets tend to be cats.

44:54.588 --> 44:55.485
- Uh, cats?

44:55.520 --> 44:59.662
- Yeah, meow, not caw, caw, caw.

45:02.078 --> 45:04.425
You should think about that.

45:04.460 --> 45:05.288
- Achoo!

45:07.566 --> 45:12.571
- Try some nettle tea with some
boiled raven's feet perhaps.

45:13.020 --> 45:14.228
- No!

45:14.263 --> 45:15.436
- That
always works for me.

45:15.471 --> 45:17.680
- Thank you for the tip,
I'll have to try it.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.996
- You should be sure to
clean behind the sofa.

45:23.030 --> 45:26.275
There's so much dirt,
you'd be surprised.

45:26.309 --> 45:31.314
- Yeah, okay, goodbye, Rumpumpel,
it was nice to see you.

45:32.177 --> 45:33.075
- I'll keep an eye on you.

45:37.182 --> 45:38.770
Meow, kitty, kitty.

45:47.814 --> 45:48.711
- Who was that?

45:54.199 --> 45:55.511
- Okay,
it's time for you

45:55.545 --> 45:57.513
to go home, it's getting late.

45:59.515 --> 46:00.688
- Did you do that?

46:00.723 --> 46:01.517
- Yes.

46:01.551 --> 46:02.449
- Thank you.

46:02.483 --> 46:03.415
- Yep, that's our secret.

46:07.281 --> 46:09.283
All right, off with you.

46:11.699 --> 46:13.253
Is something wrong?

46:13.287 --> 46:14.772
- We don't know the way.

46:14.806 --> 46:17.844
- Now don't worry about
that, you two just follow

46:17.878 --> 46:19.742
your noses and
it'll be just fine.

46:25.023 --> 46:27.577
- A real witch,
and she's not wicked.

46:27.612 --> 46:29.579
- But the
other one sure was.

46:29.614 --> 46:31.719
- Yeah, and so ugly.

46:31.754 --> 46:32.582
- Hello,

46:35.585 --> 46:40.452
are you lost, do you
need me to take you home?

46:48.460 --> 46:52.810
- Oh, spells on Friday, even
worse, in front of humans.

46:52.844 --> 46:55.157
What if you had
been caught, huh?

46:55.191 --> 46:58.643
Imagine what Rumpumpel could've
done to those children.

46:58.677 --> 47:01.611
Even you know it's extremely
forbidden to cast spells

47:01.646 --> 47:04.028
in front of humans.
- Those children.

47:04.062 --> 47:05.546
I didn't think about them.

47:05.581 --> 47:06.685
- Because you
only think about yourself.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.549
- Because you know what's best.

47:08.584 --> 47:10.241
- You should
be thankful, without me,

47:10.275 --> 47:11.483
everything would fall apart.

47:11.518 --> 47:13.244
- Oh yeah, well you
should know that witches

47:13.278 --> 47:15.763
keep cats around,
not bossy old ravens.

47:22.460 --> 47:23.288
I'm sorry.

47:26.774 --> 47:28.017
- What are you trying to say?

47:28.052 --> 47:30.364
- Nothing, I have no
idea what I'm saying.

47:30.399 --> 47:33.816
- And I'm
a homebody, is that it?

47:33.851 --> 47:35.404
- A brilliant homebody.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.344
- It's true, I may be a
wee bit out of practice,

47:44.378 --> 47:46.656
but I could fly if I wanted to.

47:46.691 --> 47:48.796
- If you wanted, you could fly.

47:51.144 --> 47:54.630
- Hm-hm, somebody does
need to keep an eye

47:54.664 --> 47:56.908
on the house when you go out.

47:56.943 --> 47:57.771
- Of course.

48:02.258 --> 48:06.262
- Just a household tip,
always clean behind the sofa.

48:06.297 --> 48:09.921
There's just so much dirt
there, you'd be surprised.

48:09.956 --> 48:13.821
- And some nettle tea will work
wonders for your hay fever,

48:13.856 --> 48:15.754
with boiled raven feet.

48:15.789 --> 48:18.896
But not with mine.

48:18.930 --> 48:19.827
- It's a deal.

49:00.903 --> 49:01.731
Oh!

49:03.664 --> 49:05.218
- And up.

49:07.082 --> 49:11.949
Now give it a spin,
yes, nice.

49:18.196 --> 49:19.957
- Stretch 'em nice
simply to keep up

49:19.991 --> 49:22.028
going to the
clouds, three times.

49:40.529 --> 49:42.876
Fly like a horse
and stay the course.

49:42.910 --> 49:44.809
Forest and pluck
into the right box.

49:44.843 --> 49:46.293
What does that mean?

49:46.328 --> 49:49.572
Rabbit's foot, apple tree,
spider, rat, and hazel tea.

49:49.607 --> 49:51.816
Three, two--
Pocus hocus,

49:51.850 --> 49:53.818
the branch is
dropping oh so fine.

49:55.268 --> 49:57.960
Hocus pocus, hot cross buns,
all and everything is done.

49:57.995 --> 50:01.929
Oh, hot cross buns, all
and everything is done.

50:08.867 --> 50:13.872
- Wake up, wake up,
yes you're going to love this!

50:20.534 --> 50:21.535
- It's snow!

50:23.572 --> 50:26.161
Abraxas, it's snowing!

50:46.146 --> 50:46.974
- Achoo!

50:52.359 --> 50:53.153
Achoo!

51:03.681 --> 51:07.443
I think you should take a little
break, you look exhausted.

51:08.479 --> 51:09.756
- No time.

51:11.068 --> 51:14.174
- Well, a little fresh
air never hurt anybody.

51:15.244 --> 51:17.695
- Look who's talking,
I'm freezing.

51:27.014 --> 51:31.605
Let's see if I remember,
ignes agnes igoonamite,

51:31.640 --> 51:33.400
fire set yourself alight.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.646
Well, that worked great.

51:47.587 --> 51:51.315
I think you're right,
a little fresh air

51:51.349 --> 51:52.730
is just what I need.

51:52.764 --> 51:53.834
- You've earned it.

51:55.974 --> 51:57.148
- Are you coming?

51:57.183 --> 52:00.117
- In this cold, I'm not
a penguin, you know.

52:00.151 --> 52:01.118
- Hm, coward.

52:02.947 --> 52:06.226
- I am not being a coward,
the world is quite a dangerous

52:06.261 --> 52:08.746
place for an old
raven such as myself.

52:08.780 --> 52:12.301
I mean, birds of prey
out there, and foxes.

52:12.336 --> 52:13.578
Not to mention the rain, wind,

52:13.613 --> 52:16.167
and snow.
- Goodbye, see you later.

52:16.202 --> 52:20.965
- But I could still fly
along, if I wanted to.

55:15.450 --> 55:17.452

55:17.486 --> 55:18.660
- No, I swear.

55:18.694 --> 55:20.731
- So where'd it
go, there's a bunch

55:20.765 --> 55:23.320
missing from my wallet, uh?

55:23.354 --> 55:26.219
- I don't know, maybe you lost
it playing nine pins again.

55:26.253 --> 55:28.773
- Ah, you talk to
me with respect.

55:31.086 --> 55:31.914
Snotty brat.

55:51.382 --> 55:53.073
Was that your dad?

55:53.108 --> 55:55.179
- It's none of your
business so just go away.

55:55.213 --> 55:56.214
- He pushed you.

55:56.249 --> 55:57.871
- Yeah, so?

55:57.906 --> 56:01.668
- That's not right, why
does he treat you like that?

56:09.400 --> 56:12.230
You can tell me, I
promise I won't tattle.

56:25.416 --> 56:27.522
You didn't really steal
his money, did you?

56:29.109 --> 56:32.319
- No, I didn't, but for
the last year he's been

56:32.354 --> 56:34.839
playing nine pins at the
tavern almost every night,

56:34.874 --> 56:39.499
and losing his money,
and he always get mad

56:39.534 --> 56:41.674
and starts making up
stuff that isn't true.

56:43.158 --> 56:44.573
- Like you stealing from him?

56:47.334 --> 56:48.750
Ever talk to him about it?

56:48.784 --> 56:51.511
- He gets mad every time
you even try to talk to him.

56:54.549 --> 56:56.413
- Sounds like you
both have a temper.

57:03.696 --> 57:05.905
You know, if
talking doesn't help

57:05.939 --> 57:07.527
maybe we can try something else.

57:31.758 --> 57:34.278
- Putting up a wager, Walinger?

57:34.312 --> 57:38.282
- You just can't
wait to lose tonight, huh?

57:38.316 --> 57:40.284
- We'll see who ends
up paying the tab.

57:42.320 --> 57:44.737
- Well, you wanna see
what a penniless man looks like?

57:44.771 --> 57:47.015
- Oh, don't
you start with me.

57:47.049 --> 57:50.950
- All right, I'll knock all
of 'em down on the first roll.

57:50.984 --> 57:52.261
- Hocus pocus ball so--
- Watch the magic.

57:52.296 --> 57:55.023
I pray to saint
thee gently lean.

58:01.270 --> 58:02.513
- Whoa-oh.

58:02.548 --> 58:03.480
- What was that?

58:08.208 --> 58:10.417
- Hey, what'd you do that for?

58:10.452 --> 58:12.868
You trying to break
my nine pins alley?

58:12.903 --> 58:15.112
- Somethin' must be
wrong with the ball.

58:19.634 --> 58:22.740
- All right, I'm ready now.
- And now.

58:22.775 --> 58:24.431
- Over there.

58:40.862 --> 58:42.519
- What in the world?

58:44.279 --> 58:47.454
- Listen friend, either you
stop rollin' the ball so blasted

58:47.489 --> 58:49.560
hard or we're never gonna
let you play here again.

58:49.595 --> 58:50.699
- Yeah.
- Um-um.

58:50.734 --> 58:52.183
- Wouldn't that be great?

58:52.218 --> 58:53.184
- Just watch.

58:56.912 --> 58:57.741
- Yeah.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.000
- You see,
there you go, I know how

59:16.035 --> 59:17.830
to handle a ball, right fellas?

59:23.974 --> 59:25.147
- It's all broken now.

59:25.182 --> 59:27.149
- How does
this keep happening?

59:41.336 --> 59:42.544
- Out with you.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.615
- We told
you what would happen.

59:44.650 --> 59:48.136
- Come on guys, I swear I
didn't do it on purpose.

59:48.170 --> 59:49.413
- Yeah.

59:49.447 --> 59:50.863
- It's like there
was a curse on me.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:24.068
- Dad, your cap.

01:00:25.242 --> 01:00:26.484
- What're you doing here?

01:00:33.457 --> 01:00:35.632
- Here's your
jacket and your scarf.

01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:51.613
- I'm sorry, Konrad, I'm
sorry that I pushed you.

01:00:54.305 --> 01:00:55.790
- Come on, let's go home.

01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:09.010
- What is it?

01:01:09.044 --> 01:01:10.045
- You forgot your ball.

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:14.360
- I don't need it anymore.

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.019
- No more?

01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:29.824
- Hey son,
what do think about

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:33.172
going sledding, like we used to?

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.691
- Yeah, or fishing?

01:01:36.106 --> 01:01:37.245
- Sounds like fun.

01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:48.463
- And she wants to dance
on Brocken Mountain.

01:02:13.384 --> 01:02:14.213
- Abraxas?

- My birthday, I
completely forgot about it.

01:02:58.429 --> 01:03:00.915
- You've been
wrapped up in your studies.

01:03:02.399 --> 01:03:04.711
- And there's 128 candles.

01:03:09.924 --> 01:03:10.821
- Now you'll have to

01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:13.548
blow them out and make a wish.

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:15.274
- Do I have to?

01:03:15.308 --> 01:03:17.172
It's just so
beautiful like this.

01:03:18.553 --> 01:03:22.281
- Yeah, you're right,
it is quite lovely.

01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:28.908
Uh, I almost forgot.

01:03:43.095 --> 01:03:44.613
- For me?

01:03:44.648 --> 01:03:49.273
- To keep you warm and cozy
better, perfect.

01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:13.159
Tomorrow's Walpurgis
and I haven't

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:15.196
heard from any of
the big witches.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:16.162
- Well,
did you really learn

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:17.439
every single spell in the book?

01:04:17.474 --> 01:04:19.614
- All 7,892.

01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:26.517
Hello.

01:04:34.422 --> 01:04:37.701
- I scare you?

01:04:37.735 --> 01:04:40.704
I am here by order
of the head witch.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.886
Your test will take place
tonight at midnight.

01:04:51.404 --> 01:04:53.751
Come to the witches'
rock past the cave,

01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:56.375
you know where
that is, don't you?

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:59.274
- Yes, so tell the head witch
I'll certainly be there.

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:02.174
- You don't have to come
if you'd rather not.

01:05:04.348 --> 01:05:07.696
Sometimes it's wiser to
simply remain at home.

01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:10.423
- But I really wanna
dance on Brocken Mountain.

01:05:13.254 --> 01:05:15.014
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.970
- Nine, 10, 11, 12.

01:05:51.533 --> 01:05:52.949
Hello?

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.192
- Yes, who's there?

01:05:57.884 --> 01:05:59.886
- Me!

01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.578
- Who is me?

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:07.377
- Me, I've come here to take
my witch's test tonight.

01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:15.557
- Now!

01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:30.848
- She's still skin and bones.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.437
- And she hasn't grown
an inch all year.

01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:35.267
- Excuse me.
- So, you've decided

01:06:35.301 --> 01:06:36.578
to take the test, huh?

01:06:37.855 --> 01:06:41.342
To show us that you've
become a capable witch.

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:42.860
Ready for your first task?

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:44.448
- Yes, I am.

01:06:44.483 --> 01:06:48.211
- Here we go,
conjure a whirlwind.

01:06:48.245 --> 01:06:50.144
- Whirlwind, whirlwind.

01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:55.873
Ventavus ventalus
vantulas voontalus

01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:59.360
verifex verifoox
vurufex hexerex.

01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:14.858
- I said stop.

01:07:14.892 --> 01:07:18.241
- Stop!

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:21.002
- Was that necessary,
why's it always my fire.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.868
- And not bad.
- That was good.

01:07:24.902 --> 01:07:27.457
Do thunderclaps, three of them.

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.805
- Thunderous thanerous thoreous,

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:34.533
thornarix thinarix thanorum,

01:07:34.567 --> 01:07:37.225
thunder thaner thinerboom.

01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:45.820
- Oh, sorry.

01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:52.689
- Make the throne of the head
witch fly up into the air.

01:07:52.723 --> 01:07:54.415
And make her hair burn.

01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:57.107
Make thick smoke
pour out of her ears,

01:07:57.142 --> 01:08:00.041
and lightning shoot
right out of her nose!

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:01.629
- No, no, calm down, calm down.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.841
No fire or smoke, hear, I'm
perfectly fine without it.

01:08:09.326 --> 01:08:10.845
Anyone else have a task for her?

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:15.746
- Now cast the
spell on page 3,574

01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:24.272
from the Book of Witchcraft.

01:08:33.038 --> 01:08:38.044
- Uh, 3,574, that was
uh, it says, that one is,

01:08:41.772 --> 01:08:45.569
I can see it, uh, ball
lightning, ball lightning.

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:48.434
- She's correct.

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:53.474
- Ballight booloo spenaloose,

01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:57.270
Ballight bowloose lightaboose.

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:20.121
- Very good.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.124
- So does that mean I can
join the dance this year?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.884
- The dance?

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:28.129
Yes, you may.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.822
- Thank you, wonderful witches!

01:09:31.857 --> 01:09:33.928
- Unless somebody
has an objection

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.586
to you joining our celebration.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.621
- Yes!
- Hm?

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:44.180
- I have an objection,
and I can prove

01:09:45.077 --> 01:09:46.906
that she's not a decent witch.

01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:50.323
Notwithstanding this
tomfoolery here,

01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:54.569
she's nothing but a
farce, a very bad witch.

01:09:54.604 --> 01:09:58.055
I've been watching
her for the last year,

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:01.127
and I have a list of her crimes.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:08.100
First, she casts
spells on Friday, tons.

01:10:10.482 --> 01:10:11.897
- Ohh.

01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:13.623
- Is this true?

01:10:13.657 --> 01:10:15.383
- Yes, but it was
only on one Friday.

01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:22.148
- And secondly, she did so
in front of human children.

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:24.979
- Oh.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:31.675
And these children, tell
me, they no longer fear you?

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.264
- Why would they fear me?

01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:36.128
- Don't you know people
everywhere need to be

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:39.269
afraid of us, it's
very important.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:40.822
- Hm-mm.

01:10:40.857 --> 01:10:43.584
- And thirdly, this wretch
chose to punish a naughty

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:48.589
little boy by bewitching a snowman
and bringing him to life.

01:10:49.106 --> 01:10:50.591
- Oh!

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:55.181
- What's worse, she did
it to help other children.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:57.667
- And I also helped the
wood women, and I helped

01:10:57.701 --> 01:10:59.151
the girl at the market
sell her paper flowers

01:10:59.185 --> 01:11:01.326
by giving them an
irresistibly sweet smell,

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.156
and Konrad wasn't really a
naughty boy, he was just sad.

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.019
- Oh-oh!

01:11:07.711 --> 01:11:11.301
- Disgusting, why would
you tell us all about

01:11:11.336 --> 01:11:12.992
what a bad witch you are?

01:11:14.891 --> 01:11:17.583
- Bad, but I only cast
spells to do good things?

01:11:18.895 --> 01:11:19.758
- Yes, exactly.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.316
Witches that cast wicked spells,
they're the good witches.

01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:30.458
But you, on the other
hand, are a bad witch,

01:11:30.493 --> 01:11:34.151
because you only see
fit to cast good spells.

01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:41.331
- Well, I didn't know.

01:11:41.366 --> 01:11:43.402
- Unbelievable, you didn't know?

01:11:43.437 --> 01:11:44.714
- No.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:47.613
- A proper witch
doesn't know this,

01:11:47.648 --> 01:11:49.374
she feels it deep
within her bones.

01:11:50.685 --> 01:11:51.721
- But I did feel it in my bones.

01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:54.758
- You also feel like you deserve

01:11:54.793 --> 01:11:56.519
to dance on Brocken Mountain.

01:11:59.798 --> 01:12:02.283
- I know what she deserves,
we should make her

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:06.391
collect the wood for the
bonfire, all by herself.

01:12:06.425 --> 01:12:08.876
- And after dancing a
few rounds, we can snatch

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:12.431
this pretender up, and
pull out all her hair,

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.088
one strand at a time.

01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:17.229
- Kind witches.

01:12:17.263 --> 01:12:19.300
- We are not kind witches.

01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:22.441
- I mean you wicked witches,
I can make up for it

01:12:22.476 --> 01:12:24.409
by being really,
really wicked as well.

01:12:26.997 --> 01:12:30.656
- Oh yeah, then prove it to us.

01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:32.658
- Sure, so what do you
want me to do first?

01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:33.866
- Oh, oh, mm, hm.

01:12:38.492 --> 01:12:43.497
- Have her turn those two
human children into stone.

01:12:50.607 --> 01:12:54.404
- You have until midnight
tomorrow to make it so.

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:56.958
Either you do exactly
as you're told

01:12:56.993 --> 01:13:01.894
or your magic power
will be forever gone.

01:13:01.929 --> 01:13:06.347
- And once that happens, you
will be banned for all time.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:09.454
- And you'll have to live
like an ordinary girl,

01:13:09.488 --> 01:13:11.179
all by yourself.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.950
- It's time to decide.

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.791
- Is that really
the only option?

01:13:36.826 --> 01:13:38.586
I'll collect all the
firewood that you want,

01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:42.383
I'll gladly take the test next
year, or the year after that.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.695
I'll juggle my broom.

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:54.706
Where did you go?

01:13:57.087 --> 01:13:59.918
- They're really
forcing you to do that?

01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:01.851
These poor children
are innocent,

01:14:01.885 --> 01:14:03.715
you know you can't
turn them to stone.

01:14:03.749 --> 01:14:07.339
- I can't, if I refuse
they'll take away my magic.

01:14:07.373 --> 01:14:12.378
- Yes, it's just so unfair,
I'll bet none of these

01:14:13.518 --> 01:14:14.760
stupid witches know
the Book of Witchcraft

01:14:14.795 --> 01:14:17.107
as well as you do.

01:14:17.142 --> 01:14:20.904
They should be punished, by
taking away their magic powers.

01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:24.218
My blood is just boiling
over this, I'm so furious.

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.461
- This is all your fault.

01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:27.255
- Excuse me?

01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:28.498
- You're the one who told me

01:14:28.533 --> 01:14:29.810
that I should be
doing good deeds.

01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:32.157
- Now hold it right
there, those good deeds

01:14:32.191 --> 01:14:33.710
were entirely your
idea, were they not?

01:14:33.745 --> 01:14:35.401
- You always know what's best.

01:14:37.403 --> 01:14:39.026
- And you are a
good witch who would

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.510
never dream of doing bad things.

01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:42.512
- And what if
I don't wanna be a good witch.

01:14:42.547 --> 01:14:46.136
- Nonsense, you
shouldn't say such things.

01:14:46.171 --> 01:14:48.725
- Oh yeah, then tell me
what you think I should do.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.765
- Uh, I've no idea.

01:14:57.665 --> 01:14:58.494
- Really?

01:15:01.773 --> 01:15:05.017
Rumpumpel was right,
what good's a raven?

01:15:06.053 --> 01:15:06.985
- What did you say?

01:15:14.855 --> 01:15:15.718
Do you mean that?

01:15:23.588 --> 01:15:24.554
As you wish.

01:15:32.113 --> 01:15:33.080
This isn't you.

01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:39.249
- Love
your neighbors,

01:16:39.284 --> 01:16:43.633
you are one, keep your
loved ones by your side.

01:16:43.668 --> 01:16:45.670
Witches' dance we need the moon,

01:16:45.704 --> 01:16:48.914
one more will be worried soon.

01:16:50.226 --> 01:16:51.676
Have been waiting for the rain.

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.782
for Walpurgis night.

01:16:54.817 --> 01:16:57.026
Gather neighbors far and wide,

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.443
keep your loved
ones by your side.

01:17:00.477 --> 01:17:05.413
Witches,.

01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:09.797
- So you've come to
turn those children

01:17:09.832 --> 01:17:12.006
into stone after all, eh?

01:17:13.698 --> 01:17:17.218
That's good, because
if you don't, I will.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.224
I promise you.

01:17:33.338 --> 01:17:38.343
- You scared
me to death, you okay?

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:45.626
- Something wrong?

01:18:03.023 --> 01:18:06.647
- Veerum varum, veerum
varum, veerum, vowum

01:18:11.652 --> 01:18:13.723
varum vixor, varum vixor.

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:33.639
I can't.

01:18:35.883 --> 01:18:37.057
- You can't do what?

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:40.716
- The big witches want
me to do wicked things.

01:18:43.684 --> 01:18:44.616
But I just can't.

01:18:50.622 --> 01:18:52.520
- That sounds like a good thing.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.764
- No, it's not good.

01:18:57.905 --> 01:18:59.251
- Can you cast a spell?

01:19:03.048 --> 01:19:04.809
- After tonight I
can't use magic.

01:19:08.226 --> 01:19:09.745
- Do you not have a spell book?

01:19:31.836 --> 01:19:32.837
- What're you doing?

01:19:36.702 --> 01:19:38.118
- I'm
drawing a circle around you

01:19:38.152 --> 01:19:41.535
to protect you from evil
until Walpurgis is over, mm.

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:52.270
- Seems you've
made your decision.

01:19:56.688 --> 01:19:58.724
You will regret this.

01:20:00.105 --> 01:20:01.693
- What's your problem
with the children?

01:20:01.727 --> 01:20:04.385
They didn't do anything to
you so why should I hurt them?

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.939
- Because you're
desperate to prove

01:20:05.973 --> 01:20:07.664
that you're a proper witch.

01:20:07.699 --> 01:20:10.012
- But it's so wrong and evil.

01:20:10.046 --> 01:20:13.636
- It is, that's
true, we're witches.

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:19.987
- Well I'm a witch too.

01:20:20.022 --> 01:20:21.955
- Not for long.

01:20:21.989 --> 01:20:23.197
- We'll see about that.

01:20:24.923 --> 01:20:29.617
- Yes, your broom will
burn nicely you'll see.

01:20:31.309 --> 01:20:33.138
At the big dance.

01:20:39.144 --> 01:20:41.629
- I am a proper witch, and
I'm not gonna let anyone

01:20:41.664 --> 01:20:43.873
tell me that I'm not,
you hear me old goat?

01:20:45.081 --> 01:20:47.463
Nobody else knows
that book by heart.

01:20:47.497 --> 01:20:49.637
You'd all be powerless
without your books.

01:20:55.022 --> 01:20:56.541
Without your books.

01:21:11.314 --> 01:21:13.523
He said, I hope that
they'll serve you well.

01:21:31.472 --> 01:21:35.062
Quiet, I'm trying
to concentrate here.

01:21:49.939 --> 01:21:51.147
Yes, that's it.

01:22:23.214 --> 01:22:24.042
Abraxsus.

01:22:30.497 --> 01:22:33.534
Abraxas, I put out
some raisins for you.

01:22:38.022 --> 01:22:40.093
I'm really sorry about
what I said to you.

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.856
I was confused and scared.

01:22:49.826 --> 01:22:51.621
But I'm not confused anymore.

01:22:55.142 --> 01:22:56.626
- Hm.

01:22:56.661 --> 01:22:58.387
- Please, watch the house
while I'm gone, okay?

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.255
I'm gonna go up to the mountain.

01:23:05.118 --> 01:23:06.050
Wish me luck.

01:23:06.084 --> 01:23:07.016
- Brocken Mountain?

01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:12.918
Don't go yet, I can
help, wait for me.

01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:18.131
There's the raisins.

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:27.899
What did you say,
she left the matches?

01:23:29.832 --> 01:23:32.800
Yes, I'm aware that she never
gets the fire spell right.

01:23:37.564 --> 01:23:39.980
To Brocken Mountain, me?

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:43.259
Well, I'm suppose to watch
the house, so I can't,

01:23:43.294 --> 01:23:44.743
no, there's no way.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.749
Oh dear.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.106
- Something is missing here.

01:24:42.594 --> 01:24:44.596
- Where is the firewood?

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:54.572
This cannot be possible.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.989
- Wrong, it is very possible.

01:25:01.475 --> 01:25:03.512
- You foul fate,
you dare to defy

01:25:03.546 --> 01:25:05.721
the order that we gave you.

01:25:06.929 --> 01:25:08.551
- Just how am I defying you?

01:25:08.586 --> 01:25:11.382
- You were suppose to turn
the children into stone

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:12.624
and you didn't do it.

01:25:12.659 --> 01:25:15.110
- Yes, yes.
- And what about the firewood,

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:18.182
the bonfire can't take place
without firewood, remember.

01:25:18.216 --> 01:25:19.700
- But
the wood's there.

01:25:19.735 --> 01:25:24.360
- Is that some kind of joke,
I see no wood around, nothing.

01:25:25.223 --> 01:25:26.742
- I think you should look again.

01:25:26.776 --> 01:25:28.123
Hocus pocus one, two, three,

01:25:28.157 --> 01:25:30.055
witches brooms come fly to me.

01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:32.437
Therum arum flip and flap,
on this lofty mountain drop,

01:25:32.472 --> 01:25:35.475
fall upon this spooky place,
build a roaring fire base.

01:25:42.792 --> 01:25:44.069
- My broom, no.

01:25:54.287 --> 01:25:55.150
- What're you doing,
are you a fool?

01:25:57.704 --> 01:26:00.948
- Hocus pocus hear me say,
witches books be on your way.

01:26:00.983 --> 01:26:02.743
High past the
roofs on my behest,

01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:05.194
please join me on
this magic quest.

01:26:12.443 --> 01:26:13.271
- Oh!

01:26:20.796 --> 01:26:21.935
- My book!

01:26:38.607 --> 01:26:41.368
- All right then,
this is happening.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.855
Well I will fly there,
you just wait and see.

01:26:47.512 --> 01:26:50.515
I can do it, I can
do it, here I go!

01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:57.764
That kinda hurt.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:02.976
- What's going on?

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:06.048
- What on Earth does she
want with our spell books?

01:27:06.082 --> 01:27:09.362
- Oh, that tiny girl
must've gone crazy.

01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:10.501
- You wretch.

01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:17.232
I'm gonna make
you pay dearly for this.

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:23.099
- Hocus pocus now hear as I say,

01:27:23.134 --> 01:27:24.687
take their witchcraft all away.

01:27:24.722 --> 01:27:26.275
Witches will bewitch no longer,

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.863
none is weaker,
none is stronger.

01:27:27.897 --> 01:27:30.831
Hocus pocus, blood and bone,
witchcraft is for me alone.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:51.369
- Oh, hump pump,
I can't remember.

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:55.925
- Outta the way, neither can I.

01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:11.424
- My power!

01:28:13.115 --> 01:28:13.943
- Oh, oh.

01:28:15.117 --> 01:28:18.154
- So
what do we do next?

01:28:21.882 --> 01:28:25.645
- You will reverse
the spell, right now.

01:28:27.232 --> 01:28:28.233
- Sorry, I can't.

01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:30.995
- Why can't you?

01:28:31.029 --> 01:28:35.862
- Because I forgot it, I
think it's on page 3,786.

01:28:37.381 --> 01:28:38.865
- She forgot the spell?

01:28:38.899 --> 01:28:42.662
- So, I think it's time
to start the bonfire now.

01:28:42.696 --> 01:28:44.422
- Oh no!
- What?

01:28:44.457 --> 01:28:46.010
- No, stop right there.

01:28:48.599 --> 01:28:50.117
- I really need those matches.

01:28:57.573 --> 01:29:01.715
Ignus agnus igatrite,
fire set yourself alight.

01:29:04.856 --> 01:29:05.685
- Huh?

01:29:06.927 --> 01:29:10.345
- Ignus agnus igatrite,
or was it iganun?

01:29:12.795 --> 01:29:14.659
- She forgot
the bloody spell.

01:29:15.729 --> 01:29:17.179
- Now what was that spell?

01:29:17.213 --> 01:29:20.182
- Well a spell book would
come in pretty handy now, eh?

01:29:21.804 --> 01:29:22.633
- I gotta think.

01:29:25.256 --> 01:29:28.017
- No, snuff out the torches.

01:29:40.409 --> 01:29:44.448
We'll get you, you miserable,
stupid little toad.

01:29:46.277 --> 01:29:48.037
- Uh yes, the toad, I remember.

01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:51.489
Bufo, bafo don't remain.

01:29:53.215 --> 01:29:54.423
- What are you doing?

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:56.632
- But settle in
the toad's domain.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:17.929
Bufo bafo all of thee, now
let your inner toad be free.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.323
Sorry, careful, pardon.

01:30:32.357 --> 01:30:36.465
All right, time to
light the fire, but how?

01:30:40.262 --> 01:30:44.542
- I'm here,
I made it, I made it.

01:30:44.577 --> 01:30:47.752
- Abraxas?
- Look at me, ought-oh.

01:30:47.787 --> 01:30:48.581
- Abraxas?

01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:53.137
Abraxas, are you all right?

01:30:55.553 --> 01:30:59.281
Oh no.

01:30:59.315 --> 01:31:02.836
- You completely
forgot the matches.

01:31:02.871 --> 01:31:05.356
You forgot to bring the
matches, you've never

01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:07.738
had any luck starting
a fire without them.

01:31:10.085 --> 01:31:13.502
- But it's been over a hundred
years since you've flown.

01:31:13.537 --> 01:31:16.609
- I might be a homebody,
I can't pretend I'm not.

01:31:18.162 --> 01:31:20.060
But this was the right occasion.

01:31:23.063 --> 01:31:25.687
- Oh Abraxas, my
dear, sweet Abraxas.

01:31:25.721 --> 01:31:28.241
Will you please forgive
me for what I said?

01:31:28.275 --> 01:31:30.830
- Yes, of course I will,
but I can't forgive you

01:31:30.864 --> 01:31:33.833
if I can't breathe,
please let me go.

01:31:35.317 --> 01:31:37.422
I'm not joking, need air.

01:31:37.457 --> 01:31:38.285
- I'm sorry.

01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:46.466
- What is she up to?

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.123
- Rumpumpel,
what are you doing?

01:31:48.157 --> 01:31:50.953
- Oh, who me, nothing.

01:31:53.853 --> 01:31:57.719
Please don't do
anything rash, you and I

01:31:57.753 --> 01:32:00.031
could be friends,
don't you think?

01:32:00.066 --> 01:32:02.724
I mean, I've never
actually had a girlfriend,

01:32:02.758 --> 01:32:07.660
but I don't know why you
and I couldn't start that.

01:32:07.694 --> 01:32:10.559
I always liked you, you know,
and just because someone

01:32:10.594 --> 01:32:13.044
accidentally casts a
couple of good spells

01:32:13.079 --> 01:32:15.806
doesn't mean she has to
lose her magic, does it?

01:32:19.844 --> 01:32:21.432
- What're we gonna do here?

01:32:21.466 --> 01:32:24.884
- I believe we've had this
discussion before.

01:32:24.918 --> 01:32:26.402
- You mean?

01:32:26.437 --> 01:32:30.683
- I do, pig snout, horns,
and horses' tails go witch.

01:32:33.306 --> 01:32:37.621
- Pebble scum, bubble gum, an
exotic beast you will become.

01:33:05.821 --> 01:33:07.236
Boo!

01:33:48.692 --> 01:33:51.039
- It's quite lovely.

01:33:51.073 --> 01:33:52.247
- All we need is music.

01:33:53.213 --> 01:33:54.145
- Music?

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.734
- Yeah, it's time we dance now.

01:33:56.769 --> 01:33:58.322
- What do you mean, we?

01:33:58.356 --> 01:34:00.738
- Well, the two of us.

01:34:00.773 --> 01:34:02.395
- Oh goodness.

01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:04.915
- Bullyton bullyton, donkey's
ear, all you instruments

01:34:04.949 --> 01:34:07.538
will appear to lend a hand
in this wonderful night,

01:34:07.572 --> 01:34:09.644
to dance a splendid
dance tonight.

01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:33.460

you've gotta see this.

- Walpurgis.

01:35:30.483 --> 01:35:32.036
Say it, Walpurgis.

01:35:32.071 --> 01:35:34.798
- Say
it again, Walpurgis.

01:35:39.837 --> 01:35:42.633
Woo, my first Walpurgis!

01:36:11.696 --> 01:36:14.113
- Woo-woo!

01:36:14.147 --> 01:36:15.597
- Hey, Walpurgis!

01:36:35.479 --> 01:36:37.136
- I'm at Walpurgis!

01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:39.000
- Walpurgis!

01:36:42.831 --> 01:36:43.659
Walpurgis.

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:13.172
- You're
taking up knitting?

01:37:13.206 --> 01:37:16.106
- I don't understand
it, I'm just trying

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.868
to conjure some rain, it
shouldn't be this hard.

01:37:21.352 --> 01:37:23.699
Hocus pocus, egg of
toad, to me white cloud

01:37:23.734 --> 01:37:26.392
now quickly float,
draw together, open up.

01:37:28.497 --> 01:37:31.466
Possum, pussum, fill our cup.

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:43.478
- Of course, you
don't mind raisins.

01:37:43.512 --> 01:37:47.240
- Well, I might've
made a small mistake.

01:37:50.381 --> 01:37:51.210
- How
'bout if we leave

01:37:51.244 --> 01:37:52.521
the spell casting to me?

01:37:53.971 --> 01:37:55.490
- You are the witch.

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:58.458
- And you are my
dear sweet Abraxas.

01:38:14.336 --> 01:38:15.165
- Thunder?
