she's a little under the weather, but...

08:04.706 --> 08:06.272
Haley, what's this about?

08:06.374 --> 08:09.242
Mr. Lawrence has a theory
he'd like to share with us.

08:09.344 --> 08:12.912
It's... it's more than a... a theory, sir.

08:12.981 --> 08:16.049
When Drill connects with a child,

08:16.151 --> 08:18.551
he apparently leaves something inside them

08:18.620 --> 08:21.621
like a... Genetic-tracking device.

08:21.723 --> 08:25.458
I believe it allows him
to connect with the child.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.595
It gives him some sort of
a... a... a symbiotic link.

08:28.697 --> 08:30.663
Do you have proof of this? We
know that Drill is losing energy.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.164
It's dissipating.

08:32.267 --> 08:34.167
I mean, do we really believe

08:34.269 --> 08:35.501
that this is some sort of coincidence

08:35.570 --> 08:38.104
that just as Drill is becoming weaker,

08:38.173 --> 08:39.102
- our kids are, too?
- Well, what exactly

08:39.126 --> 08:39.929
do you propose we do about it?

08:40.008 --> 08:41.741
We treat it like an epidemic.

08:41.842 --> 08:42.842
If... if we isolate the kids...

08:42.943 --> 08:44.177
isolate them?

08:44.246 --> 08:45.912
We give them the best possible care.

08:46.014 --> 08:49.582
We allow them to recover.
We continue our tests.

08:49.684 --> 08:51.918
But the key goal here is
to protect them from Drill.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.120

08:54.189 --> 08:55.522
people are gonna ask why.

If they start dying

08:56.758 --> 08:59.559

08:59.661 --> 09:00.860
they are gonna do a whole lot more

09:00.962 --> 09:02.262

13:51.108 --> 13:52.341
Henry! Sean: What the hell are you doing?!

Let me go! Hey, get away from my son!

13:53.744 --> 13:54.810
[Grunts] Mom! Dad!

- Henry?!

13:58.849 --> 14:00.749
Stop.

14:00.851 --> 14:02.317
It isn't supposed to go this way.

14:02.419 --> 14:04.453
Back away. Back away.

14:04.555 --> 14:05.988
[Breathing heavily] Henry, Henry.

14:06.891 --> 14:09.158
Restrain him.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.626
Wes, Wes, please.

14:10.728 --> 14:11.927
Please.

14:13.531 --> 14:14.963
You're taking children out of their homes.

14:15.065 --> 14:17.432
I am trying to <i> save</i> their homes, Claire.

14:18.836 --> 14:21.336
Take him. Wes!

14:21.438 --> 14:22.638
Sorry it had to go this way. Wes!

14:22.740 --> 14:23.772
- No, let me go!
- Come on!

14:23.874 --> 14:26.575
- No! Let me go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

14:26.677 --> 14:28.777
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

14:28.879 --> 14:30.412
It's gonna be okay, Henry.

14:30.514 --> 14:32.848
If anything happens to him,
I'm coming for you.

14:35.419 --> 14:38.687

14:44.290 --> 14:49.660
Where are they taking us?
We've been driving forever.

14:49.729 --> 14:53.764
Maybe a hospital. They think we're sick.

14:53.866 --> 14:57.335
I was, but my head doesn't hurt anymore.

14:57.384 --> 14:59.417
Mine, either.

14:59.519 --> 15:01.086
What about Drill?

15:01.154 --> 15:04.890
How is he gonna be able to
find us all the way out here?

15:04.958 --> 15:07.692
I think that's the point.

15:07.761 --> 15:11.229
They don't want him to find us.

15:28.315 --> 15:31.449
How do you know Drill can't get in?

15:31.485 --> 15:34.352
This place is surrounded
by an electricity-free zone.

15:34.421 --> 15:35.487
He can't get in here.

15:35.555 --> 15:36.955
Like a moat around a castle?

15:37.024 --> 15:38.156
Exactly.

15:43.830 --> 15:45.864
There's Henry. Can I go say hi?

15:45.966 --> 15:47.832
Yeah, of course.

[Indistinct conversations]

Henry, it's gonna be on lockdown.

I know it won't be easy
to find, Alex, but pl...

16:17.764 --> 16:19.631
- Yeah.
- Anything that you can tell us.

16:19.733 --> 16:22.300
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate this, major. Thank you.

16:22.369 --> 16:24.436
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:24.538 --> 16:25.570
Anything?

16:25.639 --> 16:27.706
Well, he... he... he said he was gonna try,

16:27.774 --> 16:29.007
but he didn't sound too optimistic.

16:29.109 --> 16:32.310
I hate this. I hate this...

16:32.412 --> 16:34.145
Not knowing where he is, the helplessness.

16:34.214 --> 16:36.781
- I fe...
- I know.

16:36.883 --> 16:38.183
I feel like I'm...

16:38.285 --> 16:41.753
Hey.

16:43.857 --> 16:46.725
I know.

16:46.827 --> 16:49.661
I made it home, though.

16:49.763 --> 16:54.132
Henry's gonna make it home, too.

16:54.234 --> 16:56.167
After your crash, he slept with that

16:56.236 --> 16:59.771
every single night.

16:59.873 --> 17:02.007
I wish he had it right now.

17:06.946 --> 17:08.279
What is it?

17:11.651 --> 17:13.852
Nothing, just... this star.

17:17.190 --> 17:20.724
At the hospital, Drill told the children

17:20.827 --> 17:24.029
that he was looking for orion and that...

17:24.131 --> 17:26.464
They'd get better once he found it.

17:28.702 --> 17:29.934
Maybe we should help him.

17:30.037 --> 17:31.903
Help Drill?

17:31.972 --> 17:34.606
If it makes the kids better, then they
get released. Henry gets to come home.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.574
Or maybe that's what he wants us to think.

17:36.643 --> 17:38.543
He doesn't have the kids
helping him anymore,

17:38.645 --> 17:41.012
so he wants <i> us</i> to.

17:41.114 --> 17:44.015
Either way... [Sighs]

Isn't it better to know what he's up to?

Wes: Dr. Benavidez, thank you for coming.

17:51.191 --> 17:53.758

I'm doing here, Mr. Lawrence.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.560
I'm not a pediatric specialist.

17:55.662 --> 17:57.562
Well, we have plenty of those.
What we don't have

17:57.664 --> 18:00.298
is someone who understands
what we're dealing with,

18:00.400 --> 18:01.533

18:01.602 --> 18:02.834

18:02.903 --> 18:04.803
when people are rounded
up by the government...

18:04.905 --> 18:07.906
this isn't like that.

18:08.008 --> 18:09.641
Are you sure?

We should get started.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.286
There's so many.

18:21.388 --> 18:23.555

18:25.759 --> 18:28.260
We have a lot of work to do.

18:39.006 --> 18:40.539
Hey, guys. Want to know a secret?

18:40.641 --> 18:41.907
Sure.

18:41.976 --> 18:43.008
See that girl over there?

18:43.077 --> 18:45.277
What about her?

18:45.379 --> 18:47.112
Her dad's running this whole thing.

18:47.214 --> 18:48.213
So?

18:48.282 --> 18:51.083
So, I bet she doesn't even know Drill.

18:51.185 --> 18:53.151
I bet she's some kind of spy for her dad.

18:57.825 --> 18:59.558
Now, are you sure
all the symptoms are gone?

19:12.740 --> 19:14.639
You and the other kids who didn't talk

19:14.708 --> 19:17.275
maybe agreed to lie and say
that you were feeling better?

19:37.064 --> 19:38.964
The thought of Silas at some facility

19:39.066 --> 19:40.499
with kids he doesn't even know...

19:40.567 --> 19:42.234
Claire: Which is why we're trying
to find a way to get him out...

19:42.336 --> 19:44.903
To get all of them out.

19:45.005 --> 19:47.072
We were hoping one of your kids
might have mentioned

19:47.174 --> 19:50.042
Drill's interest in orion at some point.

19:50.144 --> 19:53.045
This is probably a reach,

19:53.147 --> 19:55.981
but Kelly goes to school
with an Oliver Ryan.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.783
Mr. Brewster: Look, we shouldn't
even be talking about this.

19:57.885 --> 19:59.618
Claire: What do you mean?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.788
Well, when they took our kids,
we had to sign those, uh...

20:02.890 --> 20:04.189
Nondisclosure agreements, so...

20:04.291 --> 20:06.792
But that doesn't mean
we can't talk to each other.

20:06.860 --> 20:11.163
Anyone else feel like
they were followed here?

20:11.265 --> 20:12.998
Followed by who?

20:13.100 --> 20:17.169
I don't know. May... may...
maybe I'm just being paranoid.

20:17.237 --> 20:20.972
Claire: Right now
we can't worry about ourselves.

20:21.075 --> 20:24.643
We're not the ones
who are the most vulnerable.

20:24.711 --> 20:28.613
Our children are alone, defenseless,

20:28.715 --> 20:33.985
and we need to help them
while we still can.

20:36.056 --> 20:38.623
It doesn't make any sense.

20:38.725 --> 20:39.958

but the abnormality
in their brains is still there.

explain it right now.

from a child's hand,

Wait. A-are you saying...?

22:26.548 --> 22:28.448
He's possessed one of the children.

22:28.550 --> 22:29.783
You stood here and told

22:29.852 --> 22:31.718
the damn president of the United States

22:31.820 --> 22:33.720
that you were gonna keep these kids safe.

22:33.822 --> 22:35.388
I know what I said, sir.

22:35.491 --> 22:36.857
He's not gonna allow his daughter

22:36.959 --> 22:38.692
to stay in that place another minute.

22:38.794 --> 22:40.460
He's not gonna have a choice.

22:40.529 --> 22:41.761
If Drill is in one of these kids,

22:41.864 --> 22:43.096
it could be any one of them,

22:43.198 --> 22:45.332
which means no one can
leave here until we know who.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.466
All I can figure is,

22:46.568 --> 22:48.468
he must have done it before they got here.

22:48.537 --> 22:49.936
That would explain
why their symptoms are gone...

22:50.038 --> 22:51.204
Drill was dying.

22:51.306 --> 22:52.706
The only way to save himself
was to take a body.

acting strange or start...

to let you in here.

the information secret.

24:59.868 --> 25:01.401
I think we should isolate them
in separate rooms.

25:01.503 --> 25:02.602

he's able to do inside a body,

he won't make it easy.

Not yet, sweetheart.

26:32.727 --> 26:35.953
- Signs of emotional authenticity.
- A-and you gauge that how?

26:36.252 --> 26:38.819
Children this age, they're spontaneous.

26:38.921 --> 26:40.654
They can be blunt and inappropriate.

they let you know.

26:43.392 --> 26:44.524
How?

26:44.627 --> 26:47.694
They have tells, I mean, just like us,

26:47.796 --> 26:50.097
but with even less control
over the whole mechanism.

26:50.165 --> 26:51.331
They... they fidget. Their eyes wander.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.533
And that's how we
differentiate them from Drill.

26:53.602 --> 26:56.503
Exactly. Drill is not a child.

26:56.605 --> 26:58.438
He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt

26:58.540 --> 26:59.473
and fool the parents,

but they didn't know what to look for.

What's your system of interrogation?

27:08.617 --> 27:11.818
It's not an interrogation.
It's a conversation.

27:11.887 --> 27:13.287
I have a list of questions.

27:13.389 --> 27:16.423
They're... they're simple but revealing.

What do you fear?

27:27.436 --> 27:32.072

are gonna have a big fight.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.032
I'm asking you so many questions.

27:59.134 --> 28:01.568
It's because we are trying
to find something out

28:01.637 --> 28:02.869
that's very important.

28:02.971 --> 28:04.705
I don't like this place.

Well, I agree with you.

Like we don't even know each other.

30:02.124 --> 30:04.691
It's kind of like that poem
we wrote at school,

30:04.793 --> 30:06.993
the "all about me" poem.

30:07.029 --> 30:11.331
We had to write our name and

Yeah. Like in that part that said "I hear."
