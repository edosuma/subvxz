WEBVTT

00:25.943 --> 00:27.528
Sir?

00:28.362 --> 00:31.574
The telephone recordings you requested.
From La Picota.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.285
Excuse me.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.677
'He killed the DEA rat.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.929
'He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.389
'What do you want me to say?

00:55.514 --> 00:58.392
- 'Miguel's surprised us, brother.'
- 'Look, Pacho...

00:58.517 --> 01:02.688
'I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone,

01:02.813 --> 01:04.774
'but we all have limitations.

01:04.899 --> 01:09.236
'I led our organisation for 20 years
always taking care of all of you.'

01:09.361 --> 01:12.323
'I know, but the thing is,

01:12.448 --> 01:14.784
'I don't think I'm ready to surrender,
Gilberto.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.953
'Besides, I still have to find the Salazars
and resolve the situation.'

01:18.079 --> 01:22.500
'I understand, Pacho.
But you need to keep a cool head.

01:22.625 --> 01:26.796
'For now, we need
to focus on the surrender plans.'

01:44.939 --> 01:46.774
'A fucking fridge?'

01:47.441 --> 01:49.819
A message from
Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.696
Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

01:54.198 --> 01:56.826
The surveillance team
we sent to Cali.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.009
CALL ME

03:49.188 --> 03:50.731
It's a fucking leak.

03:50.856 --> 03:54.777
Someone in the Colombian government
is telling them everything.

03:55.361 --> 03:58.864
- Your CI told you this?
- Yeah. I mean, it adds up.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.826
Our most important witness gets killed
right before I get him to talk.

04:02.952 --> 04:06.330
Sir, Botero knew that
Franklin Jurado was my only play.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.082
The Minister of Defence?

04:09.208 --> 04:12.044
- Your CI said that he was the leak?
- That we had one.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.879
- Then I'd keep that to yourself.
- Sir...

04:14.004 --> 04:17.258
The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got
nothing outside of scorched earth.

04:17.383 --> 04:22.179
A dead witness, a cartel war, and
whatever the fuck that was in the jungle.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.308
We have to turn this over
to the Colombian authorities.

04:26.433 --> 04:30.354
I told Botero that he will have
your case files by 5:00pm today.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.899
Sir, what if Botero is the leak?

04:34.024 --> 04:37.736
Then we're handing it over to the guy
who works for the cartel.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.323
Ambassador, our CI, he's done
everything we've asked him to do. He's...

04:41.448 --> 04:43.075
He's risked his life, his family.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.287
- We'd be hanging him out to dry.
- So get him out now.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.291
I'll authorise the paperwork. I can have
the Marines at his doorstep in 20 minutes.

04:50.416 --> 04:54.712
No. We do that...
Miguel disappears and then we're done.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.466
You're already done.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.723
I thought you said I had until 5:00pm.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.767
What's more important,
Agent Peña?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.314
Getting Miguel Rodríguez...
or your CI's life?

05:16.734 --> 05:19.153
Crosby's handing it over
to the Colombians today.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.613
Any move we make,
we risk the leak finding out.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.365
Fucking us and Salcedo.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.367
What did Salcedo say
about the new location?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.954
David stepped up security. It would
take a battalion of cops to get Miguel.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.914
He says our best bet's to wait
for Miguel to move.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.916
Which we don't have time for.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.627
So we don't wait.

05:35.753 --> 05:39.256
Sir, maybe we should cut our losses,
get Salcedo out now.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.842
Crosby won't go for it. I asked.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.803
Guy's risked his life for us.
His wife and kids, for fuck's sake.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.432
So it's up to us to help them.
We get Miguel, we get them out.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.938
Call Salcedo again.
We take Miguel today.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.359
General,
Miguel Rodríguez is on the 7th floor.

05:58.484 --> 06:02.696
His son, David, doubled security
after the raid,

06:02.821 --> 06:06.658
and, well, there's no way to get inside
that building without attracting attention.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.620
We have to get Miguel to move.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.623
- And we capture him while they're moving.
- Exactly.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.917
How?

06:15.793 --> 06:17.169
Leave that to me.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.298
I'll stay here in Bogotá.
You coordinate the operation in Cali.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.386
But it has to be today.
There's no time.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.763
Today...

06:33.435 --> 06:39.149
Agent Peña, after our last operation,
my superior came to see me.

06:39.274 --> 06:43.612
He was very diplomatic, but he made sure
to remind me of all I've achieved.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.033
And that it could all be taken away.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.871
I worry that the only people who could do
more damage to the country than the cartel

06:52.996 --> 06:55.290
are the sons of bitches they've bought.

06:55.416 --> 06:59.586
And I don't want to risk bringing Miguel
Rodríguez to jail through the front door

06:59.711 --> 07:02.714
so they can let him out the back,
you understand?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.341
General...

07:05.426 --> 07:10.180
You put him in jail
and I'll make sure he stays there.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.728
All right. Let's do it.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.274
Let's hope the bastard enjoys
his last day of freedom.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.487
'In law enforcement,
your only real power

07:25.612 --> 07:28.115
'comes from the strength
of the system that you represent.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.826
'You gotta believe it has your back.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.662
'But sometimes...
sometimes it doesn't.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.500
'Sometimes it's so compromised,
so corrupt, that you can't trust it.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.336
'What do you do then,
when it tries to play you?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.006
'You look for a way
to play it right back.'

07:44.131 --> 07:47.885
All right, gentlemen,
Miguel's here in his apartment.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.095
Protected by a small army.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.765
Once I get the signal, I'll organise
a convoy and come down this way.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.726
Carrera 15, until we get here.

07:55.851 --> 08:00.022
There we will turn and go down
25th street until Santa Rita.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.899
How many cars?

08:02.024 --> 08:05.819
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.530
We set up roadblocks, close him in.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.033
I think that gives him
an opportunity to escape.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.410
I've got something
far more aggressive in mind.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.830
I don't want to give that son of a bitch
the opportunity to end up anywhere

08:16.955 --> 08:19.124
other than the back of my truck.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.503
You flush him out of the apartment,
and I'll take him down.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.632
'Sir, please believe me!

08:26.757 --> 08:29.176
'I swear it on my family, sir.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.803
'No! No, sir! Please wait!

08:31.929 --> 08:34.598
'I already told you the truth, sir!'

08:38.101 --> 08:40.479
Play it again. From the beginning.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.564
But what for?

08:42.689 --> 08:46.777
All you're going to hear is a man yelling
because he's being tortured, nothing more.

08:46.902 --> 08:50.072
I told you, maybe he said something
that will help us nail the motherfucker.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.699
But didn't we already catch the mole?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.827
I'll tell you something.

08:55.953 --> 08:59.206
I hate that motherfucker Salcedo
with all of my heart.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.708
But what's your problem with him?
He may be clean.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.796
The problem I have with him is
that he's a fucking lying son of a bitch.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.464
And I know it.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.259
Now start it from the fucking beginning.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.719
You hear?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.684
Chris, for this to work,
I have to leave my family again.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.812
- Okay, we'll get them out. Don't worry.
- They're watching my house.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.856
All right, so we wait,
we stay clear until we have Miguel,

09:24.982 --> 09:27.401
and then we go in
for your wife and kids.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.445
Are you gonna keep your word?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.656
We'll keep our word.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.868
Hey, what happened, Jorge?

09:38.870 --> 09:42.874
Hey, listen...
just use this to reach us.

09:48.046 --> 09:51.258
My oldest daughter, she has
her first soccer practice tomorrow.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.804
She's afraid they're gonna
make her play goalie.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.144
I don't know what to tell her.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.109
Hey, we're gonna get him, Jorge.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.667
Put all the clothes
you want to take on the bed.

10:25.792 --> 10:29.046
Put any jewellery and valuables
under the clothes.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.219
Anyone comes in,
it will look like you just did the wash.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.848
When it's time, put everything
in the suitcases, okay?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.643
Good. One more thing.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.771
Come with me, please.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.612
Paola, don't freak out.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.948
- Wait, Jorge, wait.
- It's only a precaution, Paola.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.621
- Wow.
- My love.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.831
- Eh...
- Take it, Paola.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.879
Like this. Hold on tight.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.048
Here's the safety. Now it's ready...

11:13.173 --> 11:14.675
...now it's not.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.344
That's the only thing you need to do.

11:18.053 --> 11:22.099
If anyone you don't know
comes through that door, use it.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.017
- Okay?
- Yes.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.896
My love, you can do this.
You can do this.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.863
I'll leave it here.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.746
I can do this.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.541
It's my only choice.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.919
As soon as the DEA gets here,
you go with them. You can't wait for me.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.297
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.010
Don't worry.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.934
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.733
What I'm about to tell you
is a little delicate,

12:12.858 --> 12:14.860
but it concerns all of our futures.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.279
I've been concerned
about my brother, Gilberto.

12:17.404 --> 12:23.201
The thing is, he's been speaking to some
of our partners without telling me.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.120
Undermining me.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.706
Making it very difficult
to run this business.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.709
So...

12:34.212 --> 12:37.632
...I decided to have
my brother's phone tapped.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.888
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

12:43.013 --> 12:45.515
We don't tap each other's phones.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.102
I know.
But in this case, it was necessary.

12:50.479 --> 12:54.149
I heard you two talking to him
about the surrender.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.863
And you heard something
I wasn't supposed to say or what?

12:59.988 --> 13:03.909
What is this shit, Miguel?
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

13:04.576 --> 13:05.994
Of course you can.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.871
You're not going to make
a fucking speech now.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.501
No, I'm not going to make a speech,
but I'll tell you one important thing.

13:13.835 --> 13:18.256
The surrender was Gilberto's dream.
It was never ours.

13:19.049 --> 13:23.678
Besides, we all know how good
Gilberto is at promising things

13:23.804 --> 13:26.181
when he wants something from us.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.225
What did he promise you?

13:29.059 --> 13:33.814
New York.
But did he tell you when? How?

13:34.564 --> 13:36.566
You have shit.

13:39.152 --> 13:45.826
Chepe... here you have a passport,
a new social security number,

13:45.951 --> 13:49.871
and the addresses
of two labs in New York

13:49.996 --> 13:52.499
so you can rebuild what's ours.

13:54.709 --> 13:58.255
And what did he promise you?
The Salazars?

14:00.799 --> 14:04.386
Here's the location
where the Salazars are hiding.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.930
So you can avenge your brother.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.486
Henao gave it to me.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.281
So the North Valley war is over or what?

14:25.740 --> 14:28.201
That's right. In our favour.

14:29.744 --> 14:33.915
Of course, first I had to send
that motherfucker a little gift.

14:41.882 --> 14:46.469
Look, Miguel...
I think you need to tell us the truth.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.639
No fucking lies.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.561
What the fuck have you done
with the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?

14:58.732 --> 15:01.026
Surrender's for pussies.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.797
Shh, shh, shh!

15:23.715 --> 15:27.177
Listen up... Mr. Wiretap.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.848
Never ever touch my phone.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.477
Understood?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.289
Don Miguel.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.794
Sir.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.672
- What?
- Excuse me.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.257
I just heard DEA agents are back in Cali.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.138
Any update on the accountant?

16:12.263 --> 16:16.977
Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.453
Motherfucker.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.167
This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

16:46.381 --> 16:50.176
Look there. See if you can find
anything about Salcedo.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.726
Motherfuckers.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.187
I know this isn't the ideal
situation for you and your team,

17:01.312 --> 17:03.148
but I appreciate your cooperation
with the transition.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.274
Of course.

17:04.399 --> 17:07.986
I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.529
I'll give you the phone number.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.667
And they'll stop by for the files
this afternoon.

17:23.251 --> 17:27.172
Thank you. One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.882
What's that?

17:29.007 --> 17:32.594
I received some information
regarding Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.766
It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.144
Well done, Agent. Well done.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.105
I'll get this information
to my men right away.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.440
No, that won't be necessary.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.526
I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.111
Excuse me?

17:51.112 --> 17:54.532
We can't waste any time.
You want to catch him, don't you?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.451
Of course I do.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.870
This is the best option.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.457
If we do get him, you get the credit.
I promise.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.502
Thank you, sir.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.973
Jorge?
Don Miguel wants to see you right away.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.558
Coming.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.729
Sir.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.817
Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotá.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.653
Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.615
He says they're planning a raid.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.078
We can take you to Santa Rita.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.125
- Do it.
- Of course, sir.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.220
We got some news.
Get the cars ready.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.190
Peña.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.069
'Your message went through.
Botero's the leak. Miguel's on the move.'

19:13.194 --> 19:16.281
Good. Keep me posted on stage two.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.824
Copy that.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.167
- Good morning.
- Hello.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.007
You seem happy.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.971
Defence Minister Fernando Botero...

19:40.096 --> 19:41.139
Mm-hmm.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.767
...is working with the Cali cartel.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.522
- What makes you so sure?
- Played a little "telephone".

19:49.647 --> 19:53.651
Something I said to him that only I know
was repeated in Cali.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.281
Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

19:59.449 --> 20:01.367
I'm going to show you something.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.417
- Those Curaçao bank files you gave me.
- Yes.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.128
I had a bank source help me
dig through them.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.463
And?

20:13.588 --> 20:17.050
What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

20:17.175 --> 20:18.968
on this account.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.679
Santiago Medina. Who's he?

20:21.804 --> 20:24.015
He's an art collector.

20:24.140 --> 20:28.186
But rumour is he does some money
laundering for upper-class Colombians.

20:28.311 --> 20:31.231
Cleans their cash through fancy
charities, dummy corporations,

20:31.356 --> 20:33.608
campaign contributions.

20:34.984 --> 20:40.198
Guess who Santiago Medina worked with
on the last presidential campaign?

20:42.784 --> 20:44.202
Fernando Botero.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.581
There's nothing.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.584
Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

20:51.709 --> 20:54.337
Just because you don't like him doesn't
mean everything he says is bullshit.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.172
That's got nothing to do with it.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.759
There's plenty of people I don't like
but still trust. Like you.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.520
Dario. You see that camera?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.024
Maybe it caught something. Huh?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.527
Come on.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.491
I found this one from last week.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.414
Play it.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.878
Fast forward.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.171
Faster.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.427
Hit play.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.971
And stop... stop it there.

21:47.265 --> 21:50.059
See? These motherfuckers
must be the DEA, right?

21:50.184 --> 21:53.146
- Mm-hmm.
- Keep going.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.953
His transport arrived.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.044
We're in position.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.796
I'll let you know when they come out.

22:23.968 --> 22:27.138
Where are we?

22:27.263 --> 22:30.725
'Serrano's in position.
Just waiting for Miguel to come down.'

22:36.481 --> 22:39.442
Despite how difficult
this week has been,

22:39.567 --> 22:41.944
we're making it out of the storm.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.696
It would seem so, sir.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.117
I've been thinking
about the promise I made to you.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.664
Six months until you open
your security business.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.795
That's right, sir.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.716
It's even possible that
I'll invest in your business.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.052
What do you think about that?

23:06.177 --> 23:08.221
It would be an honour
to have your support.

23:10.932 --> 23:14.727
- Can I help you with your bag?
- No, this is almost ready.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.522
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.857
Of course, sir.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.904
Keep going.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.284
Stop it there.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.376
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.840
Open it.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.886
Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.596
'Copy that.'

23:53.641 --> 23:55.768
Stop. Go back.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.771
Go back. More.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.107
There.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.114
- Isn't that Enrique again?
- Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

24:24.755 --> 24:26.174
Man...

24:27.091 --> 24:28.759
Man, you were right.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.596
You were right, man.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.056
I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.102
Take this.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.482
Careful with this.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.670
Fuck, he's not answering.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.943
Here.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.112
Thank you.

25:33.324 --> 25:36.244
- Hello.
- Dad. It's him.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.329
It's that bastard, Salcedo.

25:38.454 --> 25:41.123
David, again with this bullshit?
When will you stop?

25:41.249 --> 25:43.376
Listen to me.
I found the DEA hideout.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.211
The one Enrique told us
Salcedo knew about.

25:45.336 --> 25:49.674
'On the same street, there's a hotel with
a camera pointed towards the street.'

25:49.799 --> 25:53.636
We checked the video with Dario,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

25:53.761 --> 25:56.097
and that motherfucker Salcedo, Dad.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.392
Are you sure about that?

25:59.517 --> 26:02.270
One hundred percent.
I checked the plates.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.689
Dad, think about it.

26:04.814 --> 26:08.776
He's trying to take you out of a safe place
so they can catch you in the open.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.612
It's a trap, Dad.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.407
'Dad...'

26:15.783 --> 26:17.660
I'll call you back.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.840
Jorge, Don Miguel asked me
to tell you

26:30.965 --> 26:34.760
that he needs your help with something
before we leave.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.557
Jorge?

26:41.434 --> 26:42.643
Yes.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.900
Fuck.
They just called him back inside.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.165
Shit.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.716
David Rodríguez just showed up
at the Salcedo's.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.807
NO SERVICE

27:25.519 --> 27:27.480
- They know.
- 'Are you sure?'

27:27.605 --> 27:30.107
Has to be. They called him back inside.
David's at the Salcedos'...

27:30.232 --> 27:33.527
- Wait, wait, wait.
- 'We have to go in and get him.'

27:34.111 --> 27:36.155
'We stick to the plan.
When Miguel moves, we get him.'

27:36.280 --> 27:39.200
- They're gonna kill him.
- Yeah, well, he might already be dead.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.661
All due respect, sir,
we have to go in.

27:44.705 --> 27:45.873
All right, go.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.959
Tell Serrano we're going in.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.337
- Let's go.
- General! General!

27:51.462 --> 27:53.506
'We have to go in now! Out!'

28:04.016 --> 28:05.976
You need me, Don Miguel?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.021
Take a seat.

28:13.776 --> 28:16.404
All right, but we should be going.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.868
I think we're going to be
a little safer here.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.834
You fucking son of a bitch!

28:29.959 --> 28:32.253
What is this?
What's going on, Don Miguel?

28:35.965 --> 28:37.091
Don Miguel!

28:37.216 --> 28:40.553
Look how diligent!

28:41.387 --> 28:44.223
Girls, whatever happens,
you don't leave the room, all right?

28:44.348 --> 28:46.767
- All right.
- Don't come out for any reason.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.322
- Cover his mouth.
- Don Miguel!

29:01.198 --> 29:03.659
Please!
Ah! Don Miguel!

29:14.378 --> 29:16.297
Go to your room.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.598
Mrs. Salcedo!
We're DEA! Open up, please!

29:27.558 --> 29:29.518
Mrs. Salcedo! DEA!

29:30.352 --> 29:31.937
- DEA?
- Yes!

29:33.439 --> 29:35.232
Daniel Van Ness.
There's two men out front.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.443
They're here for you. Stay close.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.823
Let's go through the back.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.339
I believed you over my own son.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.259
You took my money.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.554
I let you protect my family.

30:07.598 --> 30:11.936
You listened to our private conversations,
you son of a bitch.

30:20.653 --> 30:25.908
I gave you all my trust.
And what did it mean to you? Shit.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.493
Nothing.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.412
You're an animal.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.917
You're a little wharf rat.

30:35.042 --> 30:38.587
Not even that.
A rat has more dignity than you.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.923
Do you know what I've just done,
motherfucker?

30:41.048 --> 30:44.218
I told David to go to your house...

30:45.427 --> 30:50.349
...and kill your wife and daughters,
you motherfucker!

30:51.433 --> 30:54.687
Mrs. Salcedo?

30:55.813 --> 31:00.025
- My kids.
- Get to their room. Stay there. Go.

31:02.111 --> 31:04.655
Ma'am, please open up.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.742
Girls, stop folding, please.
Back here. Go back here.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.661
Back! Here.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.956
I want to talk, Mrs. Salcedo.
Open up.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.189
Keep shooting!

31:42.192 --> 31:44.528
I know you're in there, Mrs. Salcedo.

31:52.745 --> 31:55.456
Don Miguel! The DEA is in the building.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.541
Get María and the boy
into a car.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.669
- Sir, you should come as well.
- Get the fuck out of here!

32:36.330 --> 32:39.625
Give me that shit. Get out. Motherfucker!

32:47.800 --> 32:49.969
Fucking rat, die!

33:17.371 --> 33:18.372
Go!

33:42.187 --> 33:45.065
Don Miguel, we have to leave right now!

33:45.190 --> 33:47.860
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

33:56.160 --> 33:58.620
- Don Miguel, we have to go!
- Kill him!

34:25.314 --> 34:27.066
You're okay.

34:28.192 --> 34:29.443
Where's Miguel?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.238
Where's Miguel?

34:52.800 --> 34:55.302
Go out the other door.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.180
Hurry up, damn it!

35:51.817 --> 35:53.485
Miguel Rodríguez...

35:54.862 --> 35:56.822
...you're under arrest.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.340
- General.
- Agent Peña...

36:15.465 --> 36:18.468
I've got Miguel Rodríguez,
handcuffed, at my side.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.518
And Salcedo?

36:33.567 --> 36:36.445
- I've got them. They're safe.
- Get in.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.281
- Let me talk to my wife.
- Jorge...

36:39.406 --> 36:41.742
Jorge? Hello, my love.
Are you all right?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.702
- 'Yes, and you? The girls?'
- Yes.

36:43.827 --> 36:47.998
Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

36:48.123 --> 36:52.794
- 'We did it, Paola.'
- Yes. Yes, we did it.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.255
'I'll be with you soon, my love.'

37:09.478 --> 37:12.022
Got a minute?

37:14.983 --> 37:17.069
- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

37:17.194 --> 37:20.822
Yes, I checked
the Samper campaign financials,

37:20.948 --> 37:24.201
and I found that in July of last year,
they had serious losses.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.871
They needed money
for travel, ads, etc.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.623
And they got $6 million.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.668
Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.838
So...
he wasn't laundering the money.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.507
No.

37:38.632 --> 37:41.009
That money stayed in the campaign.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.553
It was a contribution.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.815
I need a word. Right away.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.956
- Have a seat.
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.250
- What's going on?
- We got Miguel Rodríguez.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.543
You got him?

38:14.668 --> 38:17.129
He's on a plane back to Bogotá
right now.

38:17.254 --> 38:21.425
- It'll be all over the news in an hour.
- You couldn't let it go, could you?

38:21.550 --> 38:26.680
Sir, there's another piece of this
that you need to know.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.728
These are bank accounts opened
in Curaçao by a guy named Medina.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.604
Yeah, I know him.

38:34.730 --> 38:38.191
Good, because he was working
with Fernando Botero.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.777
They received over six million dollars
from the Cali cartel,

38:40.902 --> 38:43.780
which went into the Samper
presidential campaign.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.034
- And you know this how?
- I did some digging.

38:47.617 --> 38:52.205
Ambassador, I am certain
that the Minister of Defence is corrupt

38:52.331 --> 38:54.374
and that it doesn't stop there.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.960
You ask the president and he's gonna say
he didn't have a fucking clue,

38:57.085 --> 39:00.005
but that money won him the election.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.967
Gilberto, Miguel,
they walk right out of prison

39:04.092 --> 39:06.928
unless these fucking politicians
are in there with them.

39:17.356 --> 39:21.735
The voice you're about to hear
is the voice of the man you just mentioned,

39:21.860 --> 39:25.989
Santiago Medina,
talking to Gilberto Rodríguez.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.325
On the phone.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.869
'We've been talking, Mr. Rodríguez.

39:30.994 --> 39:34.915
'There's a lot of interest on our part.
If there's interest on your end...

39:35.040 --> 39:37.876
'Yes. Of course there is.

39:38.001 --> 39:43.340
'We would need to know what
we would be getting for our contribution.'

39:43.465 --> 39:45.425
'Of course.

39:45.550 --> 39:51.098
'As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.

39:51.223 --> 39:55.644
'The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.'

39:55.769 --> 39:58.480
'Then you have our support.

39:58.605 --> 40:03.693
- 'How would we organise the payments?'
- 'We should get together and discuss it.'

40:04.319 --> 40:06.321
How long have you known?

40:07.572 --> 40:08.990
It's complicated.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.912
The point, Agent Peña, is you're right.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.498
But in this case...

40:17.791 --> 40:19.751
...it doesn't matter.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.003
You're not gonna do anything.

40:23.797 --> 40:27.509
Samper is... a good friend to us.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.182
So that's it.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.644
They bought...

40:40.564 --> 40:41.982
...the president.

40:43.733 --> 40:45.318
And for now...

40:46.820 --> 40:49.072
...they get to keep him.

41:00.167 --> 41:02.294
We never had a chance.

41:37.913 --> 41:40.165
I know it's difficult.

41:41.917 --> 41:44.586
But you get used to being here.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.382
You bastard.

41:51.676 --> 41:56.515
Look, brother...
let's put the past behind us.

41:58.225 --> 42:01.311
I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

42:01.436 --> 42:04.523
but, regardless, we are winning.

42:05.690 --> 42:09.152
I don't know what the fuck
we're winning, Gilberto.

42:09.277 --> 42:12.572
By catching you, brother,
they did us a favour.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.242
Now Pacho and Chepe
have to turn themselves in.

42:15.367 --> 42:19.412
That's the only way
we'll be able to negotiate the terms.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.709
Well, you better be right,
because I'm not staying in this shithole.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.139
I heard about Miguel.

42:50.485 --> 42:52.821
I'm going to surrender.

42:52.946 --> 42:54.573
And Chepe too.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.077
But before that,
I have one last thing I have to finish.

43:23.518 --> 43:24.936
Gentlemen.

43:25.854 --> 43:29.524
Mr. Santacruz,
we have to ask you to come with us.

43:29.649 --> 43:31.610
You're under arrest.

43:32.402 --> 43:36.364
There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

43:39.868 --> 43:43.830
Please, Mr. Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

43:45.415 --> 43:48.126
Who do you think called the police?

43:49.461 --> 43:52.130
Here's how this is gonna go.

43:52.255 --> 43:55.717
When I'm done,
when I'm fucking ready...

43:57.010 --> 43:59.596
...then you can give me a ride to jail.

43:59.721 --> 44:01.640
Take a seat.

44:01.765 --> 44:04.976
Eat this. Come on.
Order whatever you want.

44:05.101 --> 44:06.144
Come on.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.774
Ah!

44:28.333 --> 44:30.126
This your celebration?

44:30.877 --> 44:34.506
Kind of a downer.
I was hoping for some alcohol.

44:36.716 --> 44:39.177
How long have you had them?

44:40.387 --> 44:43.640
The tapes Crosby played for me.

44:45.475 --> 44:47.310
Let me guess. It's, er...

44:48.353 --> 44:49.813
It's complicated.

44:49.938 --> 44:53.608
How about... I tried to warn you?

44:57.737 --> 45:01.324
Like you've never cut a corner
to get to the front of the line?

45:02.534 --> 45:06.830
Question is...
what you do when you get there.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.459
There's always gonna be
new bad guys to fight, Agent Peña.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.503
We make new ones every day.

45:13.628 --> 45:17.132
But... any way you slice it...

45:18.633 --> 45:22.637
...you're the agent that put cuffs
on two Cali godfathers.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.808
No small feat.

45:31.438 --> 45:32.939
Go on.

45:36.443 --> 45:38.278
You earned it.
