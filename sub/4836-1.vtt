02:52.755 --> 02:55.507
[Chattering]

02:58.011 --> 02:59.928
[Man]
Charles. That's not being chivalrous.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.848
[Woman] Don't worry, Mr. Wilcox.
There's no place in this game for chivalry.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.642
It tends to bring out
the animal in all of us.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.021
[Chattering Continues]

03:09.105 --> 03:11.773
Evie, not fair!

03:11.858 --> 03:15.068
[Chattering Continues]

04:38.403 --> 04:40.904
[Woman] "Dearest Meg,
I'm having a glorious time.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.656
"I like them all.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.867
"They are the very happiest,
jolliest family that you could imagine.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.412
"The fun of it is that
they think me a noodle...

04:48.496 --> 04:50.414
[Chuckling]
"And say so...

04:50.498 --> 04:52.666
"at least Miss Wilcox does.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.752
"Oh, Meg. Shall we ever
learn to talk less?

04:55.837 --> 04:59.172
"Oh. But, Meg. Meg,
dearest, dearest Meg...

04:59.257 --> 05:02.592
"I don't know what to say.
Or what you will say.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.886
"Paul Wilcox and I are in love.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.930
We are engaged."

05:09.100 --> 05:12.436
- Annie.
- Well! You Schlegel girls.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.273
- Tibby, look.
- Margaret, if I may interfere.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.276
- What on earth is going on?
- I —

05:19.360 --> 05:23.697
I can tell you nothing. Aunt Juley.
I know no more than you do. I —

05:23.781 --> 05:28.035
We only met the Wilcoxes last spring
while we were hiking in Germany.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.037
Oh, dear.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.248
Obviously. Someone must go down to
this Howards House and make inquiries.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.501
- Howards End.
- No, Margaret, inquiries are necessary.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.212
What do we know about these Wilcoxes?
Are they our sort?

05:39.297 --> 05:42.299
- Are they likely people?
- But. Aunt Juley...

05:42.383 --> 05:44.551
what does it matter?

05:44.635 --> 05:48.180
Helen's in love.
That's all I need to know.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.976
Would you please get me
a train timetable, dear?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.497
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.211
Paul?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.467
[Man]
I'm afraid Crane has reported sick again.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.220
But he was to take me
to the Warringtons today for tennis.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.765
- I told him.
- He's shamming. Of course.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.226
You should get rid of him, Father.
Hire a new chauffeur.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.812
[Motor Running]

06:36.896 --> 06:38.814
Mother, we're off. Good-bye.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.400
Charlie, Charlie. Wait. Wait!

06:41.484 --> 06:43.402
- What?
- Is Papa there?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.822
Wait a minute.
We've got some cherries.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.702
[Chattering, Indistinct]

06:54.414 --> 06:56.373
Dad?

06:58.793 --> 07:00.794
Evie.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.796
All right. We're off.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.006
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.888
- About last night —
- Nothing happened.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.935
- I'm afraid I lost my head, rather.
- Yes, we both did.

07:17.019 --> 07:20.856
It must have been the moonlight.
Except there was no moon.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.233
Well, that's quite all right.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.904
- Do you mind?
- No.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.999
You see. I've no money of my own,
and I still have to make my way in Nigeria.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.377
It's beastly out there for
a white woman, what with the climate...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.754
and the natives and all that.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.551
- I say, I do think you're a ripping girl.
- It's quite all right.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.595
No one knows about it.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.016
- Meg! I wrote to my sister.
- Oh. No. You didn't.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.435
Yes. I'm sorry.
Look. She's sure to come down.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.396
- We must stop her.
- We'll have to send a telegram.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.982
- Oh, Crane's off sick.
- Isn't there a bicycle?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.984
Oh, yes. There is, somewhere.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.413
That will be one
and threepence, halfpenny. Sir.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.834
[Helen] M.J. Schlegel,
Six Wickham Place, London, West.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.546
Dear Meg, all over.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.465
Wish I'd never written.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.218
Tell no one. Helen.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.496
Excuse me. I'm looking for
somewhere called Howards House.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.082
- My parcel?
- The porter has it.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.168
Mr. Wilcox.
This lady wants Howards End.

09:06.504 --> 09:10.549
Forgive my asking. Are you
the younger Mr. Wilcox, or the elder?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.510
The younger. Ah.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.972
This station's abominably organized.
If I had my way. The whole lot of them
should get the sack.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.558
- Thank you. Bernard.
- Thank you. Sir.

09:19.642 --> 09:23.228
Perhaps I should introduce myself.
I am Miss Schlegel's aunt.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.730
Oh. Rather. Yes.
Miss Schlegel's stopping with us.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.275
- Do you want to see her?
- Well. That would be very nice. Yes.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.360
I could run you up in the motor.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.328
All the Schlegels are exceptional.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.125
They are. Of course, British to the
backbone but their father was German...

09:45.209 --> 09:48.336
and that is why they care
for literature and art.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.088
Uh, just one minute.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.636
Wilcox, Howards End.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.265
I'd like you to know that
I come in no spirit of interference.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.934
I'm here to represent the family...

10:03.019 --> 10:06.479
and to talk to you
about Helen. Mr. Wilcox.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.815
My niece and you.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.985
Miss Schlegel and, uh, and myself?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.070
[Aunt Juley] I trust there's been
no misunderstanding.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.406
Well. It is true that
I am engaged to be married...

10:16.490 --> 10:18.992
but to another young lady.
Not to Miss Schlegel.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.662
Helen wrote to us, Mr. Wilcox.
She has told us everything.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.124
Good God. It's some foolery of Paul's.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.003
- But you are Paul.
- No. I'm not.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.464
- Then why did you say so at the station?
- I said nothing of the sort.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.591
- I beg your pardon. You did.
- I beg your pardon, I did not.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.468
My name is Charles.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.512
Do you mean to tell me that
Paul and your niece have —

10:39.597 --> 10:41.514
The idiot!

10:41.599 --> 10:43.558
Damn fool!

10:43.643 --> 10:46.269
Look. Uh, I warn you.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.897
It's useless.
Uh, Paul hasn't a penny.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.275
No need to warn us.
The warning is all the other way.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.529
But he hasn't told us, whereas your niece
has lost no time in publishing the news.

10:56.614 --> 11:00.241
If I were a man. Mr. Wilcox,
for that last remark, I'd box your ears.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.410
You're not fit to sit
in the same room as my niece...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.913
- All I know is she spread the news —
- Or to clean her boots.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.665
- Might I finish my sentence, please?
- No!

11:06.749 --> 11:08.708
I decline to argue with such a person.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.670
- Let me out of this car this instant!
- Don't try and stand up!

11:11.754 --> 11:13.713
- Stop! Stop!
- Sit down. Sit down!

11:13.798 --> 11:15.507
- Stop!
- Just sit down!

11:15.591 --> 11:17.509
For goodness sakes!

11:17.593 --> 11:19.803
Just —

11:27.937 --> 11:29.979
[Bicycle Bell Ringing]

11:43.285 --> 11:45.203
Push it down.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.335
Oh, Helen.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.672
It's all right.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.683
[Classical On Piano]

12:23.868 --> 12:26.035
[Continues]

12:33.544 --> 12:35.879
It will, I think.
Be generally admitted...

12:35.963 --> 12:41.342
that Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
is the most sublime noise...

12:41.427 --> 12:45.388
ever to have penetrated the ear of man.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.390
What does it mean?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.560
We can hardly fail
to recognize in this music...

12:50.644 --> 12:52.979
a mighty drama:

12:53.063 --> 12:56.816
The struggle of a hero
beset by perils...

12:56.901 --> 13:01.196
riding to magnificent victory
and ultimate triumph...

13:01.280 --> 13:05.909
as described in the development
section of the first movement.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.036
What I want to draw
your attention to now...

13:08.120 --> 13:10.997
is the third movement.

13:11.081 --> 13:15.585
We no longer hear
the hero, but a goblin.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.712
Thank you, Mother.

13:19.256 --> 13:23.843
- [Mid-Tempo]
- A single. Solitary goblin...

13:23.928 --> 13:27.847
walking across the universe...

13:27.932 --> 13:30.308
from beginning to end.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.317
- Why a goblin?
- [Stops]

13:39.401 --> 13:42.445
- I begyour pardon?
- Why a goblin?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.447
Well, it's obvious.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.325
The goblin signifies
the spirit of negation.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.870
But why specifically a goblin?

13:50.955 --> 13:55.875
Panic and emptiness.
That is what the goblin signifies.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.919
Minor, spelling panic.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.048
Major, magnificent.

14:02.132 --> 14:06.135
- [Resumes]
- A hero, triumphant.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.516
Miss.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.643
Excuse me. Miss. My umbrella.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.609
Miss.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.665
[Thunder Rumbling]

14:40.504 --> 14:43.715
Miss! Miss!

14:47.928 --> 14:49.846
[Church Bells Ringing]

14:49.930 --> 14:52.849
Mrs. Wilcox, I haven't got
her wedding dress wet.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.395
[Man]
Hurry up, Charles.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.981
[Woman]
Charles. It's bucketing down!

15:00.065 --> 15:03.776
- [Charles] Go on. In you go.
- [Man] Good-bye.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.362
- Darling, the flowers.
- Good luck.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.451
- Paul, my hat's in your hand.
- Good-bye.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.536
See you there.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.691
What astonishing bad luck...

15:43.776 --> 15:47.111
that in the whole of London
they could find no flat to rent...

15:47.196 --> 15:49.822
except the one bottled right up
against our library window.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.075
Who could find no flat?

15:52.159 --> 15:55.495
Tibby, the Wilcoxes.

15:55.579 --> 16:00.333
Surely even you remember that business
last summer with Helen and Paul Wilcox.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.335
Paul Wilcox.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.129
The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.591
Oh, miss!

16:28.320 --> 16:30.697
What is it? Is Tibby ill?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.615
Tibby's making tea.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.368
Oh, well.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.830
- If it's nothing worse than that.
- Now. Helen —

16:38.914 --> 16:42.458
Oh, dear.
Something odd has happened.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.877
Promise me you won't mind.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.339
It's the Wilcoxes.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.635
They've taken the flat opposite
for the wedding of their son.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.971
The other son.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.977
You do mind.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.153
Will Paul Wilcox point
at our house and say...

17:10.237 --> 17:11.945
"There lives the girl
who tried to catch me"?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.073
Ridiculous.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.161
They've only taken the flat
for a few weeks, the porter said.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.500
Do we bow,
or do we cut them dead?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.753
Darling...

17:27.838 --> 17:29.797
why don't you take up
Cousin Frieda's invitation...

17:29.882 --> 17:32.300
and go to Hamburg
for those few weeks?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.219
Yes. I think I shall.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.597
Not that it matters. But...

17:37.681 --> 17:40.349
one wouldn't want to keep
bumping into Wilcoxes.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.065
Don't hog all
those scones. Tibby.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.031
Is that young man for us.
Do you suppose?

17:56.992 --> 17:59.327
He is for us.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.878
Uh, if you'll pardon me, miss.
You took my umbrella.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.464
Quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

18:11.548 --> 18:15.218
At the Ethical Hall.
"Music and meaning."

18:16.303 --> 18:19.680
I'm so sorry. I do nothing
but steal umbrellas.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.724
Do come in and choose one.
It's all right. Annie.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.561
Let's see, is yours
a hooky or a knobbly?

18:25.646 --> 18:29.398
Mine's a knobbly. At least I think it is.
That's Tibby's. How about this one?

18:29.483 --> 18:32.652
I suppose you really oughtn't
open these indoors. Never mind.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.822
No. It's all gone along the seams.
It's an appalling umbrella.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.865
It must be mine.

18:39.743 --> 18:44.122
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Has my sister stolen your umbrella?

18:44.206 --> 18:47.875
Oh, not again. Helen. She is
an incorrigible thief. I am so sorry.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.337
- I say, do stay for tea. Mr. —
- Bast.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.674
- Mr. Bast. Won't you stay for tea?
- Yes, do stay, Mr. Bast.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.884
It's the least we can do
having made you all wet.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.886
Our brother's upstairs.
So you'll have a chaperon.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.640
- Look, he's soaked. Meg. Please come up.
- Helen. Put him upstairs.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.603
What did you think of the lecture?
I don't agree about the goblins.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.689
But I do about
the heroes and shipwreck.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.317
You see, I'd always imagined a trio
of elephants dancing at that point.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.527
Well, he obviously didn't.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.737
- "Music and Meaning," Margaret.
- Oh. "Music and Meaning."

19:16.822 --> 19:19.532
Does music have meaning?
Of the literary kind. I mean.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.868
- That's pure slush.
- A guest.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.121
- Mr. Bast. Won't you take off your coat?
- And trust us with your umbrella?

19:25.205 --> 19:27.748
- And sit down.
- Have some tea, won't you?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.917
How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.502
- China tea?
- Do you take sugar?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.379
"Only the score"?
What an insidious "only."

19:33.463 --> 19:35.381
We do have the other
kind of tea. If you prefer.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.383
- Thank you, but. Uh —
- Don't you want that?

19:37.467 --> 19:40.636
Here are some scones that
Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.605
We are so very sorry to have
put you to this inconvenience.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.107
I hope you will
come another day.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.151
Would you?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.197
We should be so glad.
Do take our card.

19:59.281 --> 20:03.242
Thank you. If you'll excuse me.
I really must be going.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.418
I'll see you out. Are you sure you
don't want a scone for the journey?

20:12.502 --> 20:17.340
No. No, thankyou.
I must be going. Good-bye.

20:39.404 --> 20:44.575
Why didn't you make that
young man welcome, Tibby? Hmm?

20:44.660 --> 20:47.328
You must do the host
a little, you know.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.456
You could've coaxed him
into stopping...

20:50.540 --> 20:53.709
instead of letting him
be swamped by screaming women.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.802
[Chattering]

21:02.886 --> 21:05.179
[Whistling]

21:11.520 --> 21:15.439
Get your hot soup here.
Hot soup. lovely and warm.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.234
[Continues Whistling]

21:20.529 --> 21:22.446
[Train Rumbling]

21:23.490 --> 21:26.200
[Woman]
That you, Len?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.369
Where have you been?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.789
- I'm off my head with worrying.
- About what?

21:31.873 --> 21:34.458
- About you.
- Let go, Jacky.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.545
Every ti me I 'm five mi n utes late,
you see me lyi n g dead i n the road...

21:37.629 --> 21:39.547
crushed a nd ki I led
in a gruesome accident.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.883
Wel I, people do get kil led i n accidents
a nd don't come home no more.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.303
Anymore, Jacky.

21:45.387 --> 21:49.432
I told you I was goi ng
to a lectu re on "M usic a nd Mea n i ng."

21:50.726 --> 21:52.643
I lost my u m brel la.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.271
It's a I I right. I got it back.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.697
Have you had your tea?
I've kept you a bit of tongue in jelly.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.782
- No.
- Sure?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.787
I'll have it. Then.
Funny, isn't it?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.458
Every time I worry,
I get starving hungry.

22:17.669 --> 22:22.256
The thoughts that go through
my head. You'd laugh.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.967
You listening. Len?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.053
Not only accidents.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.305
That you'll get wet in the rain.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.766
- Didyou?
- No.

22:31.850 --> 22:36.187
You said you lost your umbrella.
I'll think, "Lord, he'll catch cold.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.189
"It'll go to his chest.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.232
"And where's the money
to come from for the doctor?

22:40.317 --> 22:42.651
"And what if he is
in an accident...

22:42.736 --> 22:45.321
"and they take him to the hospital
in the ambulance?

22:45.405 --> 22:47.073
And him with holes in his socks."

22:47.157 --> 22:49.075
- Hey, Jacky.
- I want to see.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.826
- What?
- If there's holes in you r socks.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.912
Stop it, Jacky.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.667
Len.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.639
- Come to bed.
- I'I I just finish this chapter.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.434
Len.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.527
- You love you rJacky, do you. Len?
- Let me read.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.661
Len.

23:34.996 --> 23:38.999
- Are you gon na ma ke it al I right?
- You're not starting on that again.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.001
I've told you a hund red times
if I've told you once...

23:41.086 --> 23:43.712
we'I I get married the day I'm 21.

23:43.797 --> 23:47.341
I'd do it before if it weren't for my
brother would come and put a stop to it.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.431
What's it to him?
What's he ever done for me?

23:53.515 --> 23:56.725
That's right.
What's a nyone ever done?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.477
It's just you and me.

23:58.562 --> 24:02.898
And if you was to go a nd leave me,
I don't know what I'd do. I truly don't.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.821
Now go to bed.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.909
You come too. Come on.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.833
- Book ma rker.
- "Ma rga ret Sch legel."

24:20.917 --> 24:23.586
And who is Margaret Schlegel?

24:23.670 --> 24:28.090
- Just a lady I met.
- Oh, a lady. La-di-da.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.217
Come off it, Jacky.
She's a hundred years old.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.970
Says you.
So that's where you had your tea.

24:33.054 --> 24:37.266
Nice cucu mber sandwiches
cut ever so thin.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.077
[Leonard] "Ankle-deep,
he waded through the bluebells.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.205
"His spirit rose and exulted...

24:59.289 --> 25:02.750
"as he breathed in
the sun-drenched air.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.712
"The glorious day
was in its last decline.

25:06.796 --> 25:10.883
"Long shadows lay on the sward,
and from above...

25:10.967 --> 25:14.386
"the leaves dripped their shimmering
drops ofgold-green light.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.599
"Moths and butterflies
swarmed in merry hosts...

25:18.683 --> 25:21.685
"flittering here,
glimmering there.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.939
But hush.
Could that be a deer?"

25:41.289 --> 25:43.666
[Train Passing]

26:15.198 --> 26:18.659
[Mrs. Wilcox]
Oh, please show her in.

26:26.376 --> 26:30.796
Hello. I'm so sorry.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.507
Why, Miss Schlegel.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.676
How kind of you to call.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.262
I've wanted to
for ever so long.

26:38.346 --> 26:43.058
But we haven't been here
for ever so long.

26:43.143 --> 26:47.104
Mrs. Wilcox. Uh, may I?

26:47.188 --> 26:51.567
You see, all that business
last summer at Howards End —

26:51.651 --> 26:53.652
No. It goes further than that.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.447
Since we met at Speyer.
Do you remember?

26:56.531 --> 26:59.158
That restored cathedral
we all hated so.

26:59.242 --> 27:03.078
What I remember
principally about Speyer...

27:03.163 --> 27:06.582
was the great pleasure
of meeting you. Miss Schlegel.

27:08.668 --> 27:14.048
- Helen's gone to Germany.
- And Paul's gone to Nigeria.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.216
[Chuckling]
So...

27:16.301 --> 27:19.553
you see, now we can meet.
Because they can't.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.640
It's no use beating about the bush.
What happened in the summer...

27:22.724 --> 27:25.476
was unfortunate
for both of them, don't you feel?

27:25.560 --> 27:27.853
Because —
I'm sure you think the same way.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.106
- Because they should not meet.
- Yes. I feel that.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.693
They belong to types that can
fall in love. But can't live together.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.113
I'm afraid that
in nine cases out of ten...

27:38.198 --> 27:40.616
nature pulls one way
and human nature the other.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.581
I do rattle on. I'm afraid
I shall tire you out in no time.

27:47.666 --> 27:52.336
It is true I am not
particularly well just today.

27:54.130 --> 27:58.634
But I'm so grateful for your visit.
Miss Schlegel. You see. I'm quite alone.

27:58.718 --> 28:02.930
My husband and daughter have gone off
on a motoring tour in Yorkshire...

28:03.014 --> 28:05.933
and the young couple
are on their honeymoon.

28:06.017 --> 28:10.270
- Charles and Dolly.
- Oh. May I see? How lovely.

28:10.355 --> 28:15.484
They've gone to Naples. I can hardly
imagine my Charles in Naples.

28:15.568 --> 28:19.405
- Doesn't he like traveling?
- Oh. Yes. He likes travel.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.074
But he does see through
foreigners so.

28:22.158 --> 28:27.204
What he would enjoy most
is a motor tour through England.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.249
Charles takes after me,
Miss Schlegel.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.085
He truly loves England.

28:35.171 --> 28:39.842
Not. Of course, London.
None of us love London.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.681
It's so —

28:46.683 --> 28:50.978
It makes one feel so unstable.
Impermanent...

28:51.980 --> 28:55.149
with houses being torn down
on all sides.

28:56.568 --> 29:01.280
Including,
in the foreseeable future, ours.

29:01.364 --> 29:04.742
- Are you having to leave Wickham Place?
- Yes.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.119
In 18 months or so
when the lease expires.

29:07.203 --> 29:10.205
- Have you been there long?
- All our lives. We were born there.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.958
Oh, the —

29:13.042 --> 29:15.294
That is monstrous.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.463
Oh, I do pity you,
from the bottom of my heart.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.716
I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.802
- How dreadful.
- Oh, well —

29:23.887 --> 29:27.139
- Oh. You poor, poor girls.
- Well, of course...

29:27.223 --> 29:31.477
we are fond of the house.
But it is an ordinary London house.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.730
- We shall easily find another.
- No.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.399
Not in this world.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.737
Not the house
that you were born in.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.323
You'll never find that again.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.408
Poor, poor girls.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.745
[Sighs]

29:49.829 --> 29:52.206
Howards End was almost
pulled down once.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.709
It would have killed me.
It's my house. You know.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.546
It was left to me by my brother
who died out in India.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.465
I love it so.

30:01.549 --> 30:05.219
I even resisted when Henry —
my husband —

30:05.303 --> 30:08.388
wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

30:08.473 --> 30:12.267
He knew best. Of course.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.019
[Chuckles]

30:14.103 --> 30:16.563
We even have a garage.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.196
To the west of the house...

30:24.280 --> 30:27.241
just beyond the chestnut tree...

30:28.243 --> 30:31.912
in the paddock where
the pony used to be.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.791
Where's the pony gone?

30:37.377 --> 30:41.505
The pony?
Oh, dead, ever so long ago.

30:42.632 --> 30:47.469
The vice of the pan-German mind is that
it only cares for what it can use.

30:47.554 --> 30:51.056
- That is the vice of the imperial mind.
- No, that is the vice of the vulgar mind.

30:51.140 --> 30:55.310
But, and this is the tremendous part.
They take poetry seriously.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.105
- They do take poetry seriously.
- But is anything gained by that?

30:58.189 --> 31:01.608
Yes, the Germans
are always striving for beauty.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.863
Oh, but. Mrs. Wilcox, my father
was a German of the old school...

31:05.947 --> 31:07.906
a philosopher. An idealist...

31:07.991 --> 31:09.867
the countryman of Hegel and Kant.

31:09.993 --> 31:13.412
- But isn't that your father's sword
you have upstairs in the drawing room?
- Oh, yes.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.414
He was a soldier too when he had to be.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.000
But he was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side...

31:18.084 --> 31:20.794
that he just hung up his sword
and never used it again.

31:22.338 --> 31:26.174
- My idea has always been that...
- [Chatter Dies Down]

31:28.636 --> 31:33.265
If we could bring the mothers...

31:33.349 --> 31:38.020
of the various nations together...

31:39.355 --> 31:41.481
then there would be no more war.

31:42.483 --> 31:45.110
- Oh. Indeed. Yes.
- Absolutely.

31:45.194 --> 31:48.780
If the mothers went to war.
There'd be no one left to defend.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.533
- Mrs. Wilcox. Will you have another jelly?
- Thank you.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.870
You are fortunate in your cook.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.540
We have found it difficult to get
reliable servants in London.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.960
- It is difficult.
- Servants have become as unreliable as we.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.130
We can hardly expect them to listen to
radical discussions at the luncheon table.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.174
Annie does very well.
Don't you. Annie?

32:07.258 --> 32:08.967
You're very patient with us.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.638
We never discuss at Howards End...

32:12.722 --> 32:14.640
except perhaps sport.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.101
Oh, but you should.
Discussion keeps a house alive.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.646
You will laugh
at my old-fashioned ideas.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.231
[Chuckles]
I will not.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.401
I sometimes think...

32:29.072 --> 32:32.532
it would be wiser to leave
action and discussion to men.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.744
But. Then where would
we be with the suffrage?

32:37.538 --> 32:41.750
I am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.758
Shall we go up for coffee?

32:50.760 --> 32:54.429
Duncan. Will you lead the way?
Thank you.

32:54.514 --> 32:58.558
[Chattering, Indistinct]

33:09.612 --> 33:14.116
- What interesting lives you all lead.
- No. We don't.

33:15.201 --> 33:18.120
It's no use pretending
you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.039
But I hope you will forgive me...

33:21.124 --> 33:24.084
by coming again. Alone.
Or by asking me to you.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.713
I enjoyed my lunch very much.
Miss Schlegel, truly I did.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.798
I only wish I could've joined in more.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.259
You're —

33:32.343 --> 33:36.722
You're so clever,
and yet, so good.

33:36.806 --> 33:40.517
No, that's very kind of you,
but I am neither, I'm afraid.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.645
You've been very good to me.
You've kept me from brooding.

33:43.730 --> 33:47.858
- I'm too apt to brood.
- About what?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.903
Well, I don't know.
I really don't know.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.408
I think about my house a great deal.

33:56.492 --> 33:59.786
You've never seen Howards End.
I want to show it to you.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.606
[Margaret] Now. This is the scientific
approach to Christmas shopping: A list.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.150
[Mrs. Wilcox]
A list. What a good idea.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.112
Why don't you put your own name
at the top of the list?

34:34.197 --> 34:38.366
Hurray. How very kind of you
to start with me.

34:39.368 --> 34:43.371
"Schlegel." Now, next.
Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

35:03.476 --> 35:07.312
- Quite out of the ordinary, you know?
- I know. It's these.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.815
Now. What do you think of that?
And a pretty box.

35:09.899 --> 35:13.235
Oh. Yes.
Oh, thank you very much.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.946
- Good. I'm glad.
- You are wonderfully efficient.

35:16.030 --> 35:19.324
- Thank you. Could we
wrap that with a nice bow, please?
- Certainly, madam.

35:19.408 --> 35:23.286
- But your name still remains
at the top of the list.
- [Chuckles] Yes.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.288
So, Dolly. There she goes.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.543
I would like to give you
something worth your friendship.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.005
Couldn't you get it renewed?

35:34.090 --> 35:37.425
- I beg your pardon?
- The lease of your house?

35:37.510 --> 35:40.011
Oh, have you been thinking of that?
How very kind of you.

35:40.096 --> 35:43.640
- Surely something could be done.
- No. Values have risen too enormously.

35:43.724 --> 35:46.017
They mean to pull down Wickham Place
and build flats like yours.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.020
- But how horrible.
- Landlords are horrible.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.606
And so are the flats they build.

35:51.691 --> 35:57.237
I fail to understand how people
can actually choose to live in them.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.159
There we are.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.412
Oh, dear. There, there we are.
Thank you.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.706
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.383
Thank you.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.472
[Groans]

36:24.557 --> 36:27.225
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We shouldn't have done this today.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.436
No. No, we had to do it before.

36:30.479 --> 36:34.482
- Before?
- Before my operation.

36:34.567 --> 36:38.695
I still haven't told my family yet,
Miss Schlegel. Everyone hates illnesses.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.823
Ah, it's as it should be.

36:42.825 --> 36:47.037
There's a chestnut tree
at Howards End...

36:47.121 --> 36:50.081
that has pigs' teeth
stuck into the trunk...

36:50.166 --> 36:53.376
about four feet from the ground.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.962
Yes. The teeth of a pig.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.424
The country people
put them there long ago...

36:59.508 --> 37:03.511
and they think that if they chew
a piece of the bark...

37:04.889 --> 37:07.807
it will cure the toothache.

37:09.518 --> 37:14.147
I love folklore
and the old superstitions.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.608
Isn't it is curious though.
That unlike Greece...

37:16.692 --> 37:18.735
England has no true mythology.

37:18.819 --> 37:21.279
All we have are
witches and fairies.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.323
[Sighs]

37:24.325 --> 37:26.660
Will you come with me to Howards End?

37:28.371 --> 37:32.082
- Oh. I would so much like to.
- Come with me now, now.

37:32.166 --> 37:36.294
- Now? But it is too late.
- There is a train from St. Pancras
at 5:00 if we hurry.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.672
- I want you to see it.
- And I want to see it.

37:38.756 --> 37:42.092
It sounds such a glorious place.
So redolent and —

37:42.176 --> 37:45.804
Yes, yes. I lived there long,
long before I was married.

37:45.888 --> 37:48.390
I was born there.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.850
Well, might I come some other day?

37:52.687 --> 37:54.604
Yes.

37:56.023 --> 37:58.692
Some other day.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.783
Well. A thousands thanks.
Miss Schlegel. For your help.

38:06.867 --> 38:10.161
It is a comfort to have
the presents off my mind...

38:10.246 --> 38:12.789
the Christmas cards especially.

38:12.873 --> 38:16.042
- I do admire your choice.
- [Clock Chimes]

38:19.088 --> 38:22.090
[Train Whistle]

38:29.432 --> 38:31.433
Whoa.

38:46.532 --> 38:48.450
Mrs. Wilcox.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.494
- Miss Schlegel.
- I will come if I still may.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.080
Return to Hilton. Please.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.876
- We'll stop the night, my dear.
- Yes.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.628
It's in the morning my house
looks most beautiful.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.298
Two returns, please.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.300
Thank you.

39:06.635 --> 39:11.014
- This is yours?
- I can't show you my meadow
properly except in the sunrise.

39:11.098 --> 39:14.726
- It was so romantic. It was in Italy.
- In Italy?

39:14.810 --> 39:17.312
Yes. And the two trains
stopped on either side. You see...

39:17.396 --> 39:20.231
and I opened the window...

39:20.316 --> 39:22.275
and this man just
handed a rose across.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.527
I don't know where he got it.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.738
- Was he Italian?
- Yes, I think so. Italian.

39:26.822 --> 39:28.823
Ah. He'd have to be
Italian, wouldn't he?

39:28.908 --> 39:32.202
- Mother!
- Evie. My dearest girl.

39:32.286 --> 39:35.580
- The motor's smashed.
- Ruth, what on earth are you doing here?

39:35.664 --> 39:37.582
- We crashed the car.
- What?

39:37.666 --> 39:40.335
- Are you going to Howards End? Why?
- Yes.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.337
- How are you?
- It's such a lovely surprise.

39:42.421 --> 39:44.923
I'm fit as a fiddle.
You remember Miss Schlegel?

39:45.007 --> 39:47.300
Miss Schlegel?
Oh, yes. Helen's sister. Hello.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.221
- Evie crashed the car in Yorkshire.
- How do you do?

39:51.305 --> 39:54.766
We must go home. We can't go
to Howards End. It's ten to 5:00.

39:54.850 --> 39:59.187
Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our little outing
is going to have to be another day.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.313
- Before I forget.
- Thank you.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.067
- There's a German expression for that.
- Aufgeschoben ist nicht aufgehoben.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.611
- Yes. Not canceled, but postponed.
- Postponed.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.780
- Come home with us.
- No, no.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.824
- You sure?
- Please. Good-bye.

40:11.867 --> 40:15.203
- Till later.
- [Henry] How lovely to see you.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.178
I've been thinking of you.

40:35.307 --> 40:38.143
And ofour meadow.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.228
Here.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.568
The day you are strong enough...

40:46.652 --> 40:49.362
I shall hold you
to your promise.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.456
Oh, Miss Schlegel.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.205
So, to repeat, we have here...

43:05.207 --> 43:08.459
forwarded by the matron
of that nursing home...

43:08.544 --> 43:10.545
sealed and addressed to me...

43:11.880 --> 43:15.091
a note purporting to be
in your mother's handwriting.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.135
And it says...

43:17.219 --> 43:20.179
"I would like Miss Schlegel.
Margaret...

43:20.264 --> 43:22.765
to have Howards End."

43:22.850 --> 43:24.934
Mother never wrote that.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.606
No date.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.442
- No signature.
- Of course.

43:32.526 --> 43:35.028
It's a forgery.

43:36.655 --> 43:39.741
Not now. Please. Later.
Thank you.

43:41.619 --> 43:45.079
The house was of course your mother's
to leave to whom she wished.

43:46.248 --> 43:48.166
Let me see it.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.631
Why, it's only in pencil.
Pencil never counts.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.550
Yes. We know that it is not
legally binding, Dolly.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.761
We are aware of that.

44:00.888 --> 44:03.890
Of course, my dear,
we consideryou as one of the family.

44:03.974 --> 44:07.268
But it will be better if you don't
interfere with what you don't understand.

44:08.604 --> 44:11.522
The question is whether...

44:11.607 --> 44:14.484
during the time that this Miss Schlegel
managed to befriend my mother —

44:14.568 --> 44:16.861
I don't think it's a case
of undue influence.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.822
To my mind the question is...

44:19.907 --> 44:22.283
the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

44:22.368 --> 44:25.286
My dear father,
consult an expert if you wish...

44:25.371 --> 44:27.955
but I don't admit that it is
my mother's handwriting.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.957
You just said it was.

44:30.042 --> 44:32.502
Never mind if I did.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.216
So we are all agreed then that
legally I would be quite justified...

44:38.300 --> 44:40.301
in tearing this up and
throwing it into the fire.

44:41.303 --> 44:46.224
All else aside, how is this gift
to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel?

44:46.308 --> 44:49.143
Is she to have a life interest in it
or is she to own it absolutely?

44:49.228 --> 44:52.605
She may be on her way down
this very minute to turn us all out.

44:54.108 --> 44:57.568
I don't believe Miss Schlegel
knows anything about this. Uh...

44:57.653 --> 44:59.320
this whim of your mother's.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.573
Mother believed so in ancestors.

45:02.658 --> 45:05.660
She would never have left
anything to an outsider.

45:06.662 --> 45:10.206
If Miss Schlegel had been poor.
If she had wanted a house —

45:11.208 --> 45:14.335
But she has a house.
Why should she want another?

45:17.923 --> 45:20.675
She wouldn't have wanted us
to even see this thing.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.261
No.

45:23.345 --> 45:26.389
Your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

46:05.304 --> 46:09.557
- Len, you coming in?
- In a minute.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.559
Yeah, all right.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.401
What are you looking at?

46:20.486 --> 46:24.614
See that big one up there?
It's Ursa Major. The great bear.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.284
You follow those two down
about four times...

46:28.368 --> 46:30.286
and that one there
is the polestar.

46:30.370 --> 46:33.998
- I'm fairly certain that's it.
And they all go round that one.
- They're just stars.

46:34.082 --> 46:36.417
Jacky. Stop it.
It's important.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.378
You'll catch your death.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.470
[Chattering, Indistinct]

47:04.947 --> 47:06.864
Yes. Sir.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.784
When can I expect
to receive that?

47:09.868 --> 47:12.495
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Purefour's policy.

47:12.579 --> 47:14.497
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.

47:14.581 --> 47:17.708
That's all signed.
It seems fine with me. Thank you.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.336
So may I expect
to receive that?

47:20.420 --> 47:22.338
Oh, yes.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.176
All right, Mr. Jackson.
You're all done.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.564
Could you. Uh,
complete that?

47:39.648 --> 47:41.566
Yes. Of course. Sir.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.966
[Leonard] "The trees
reared in mighty columns...

48:07.050 --> 48:10.428
"their tops still radiant
in sunlight which...

48:10.512 --> 48:13.931
"spilling downward
through the wealth of leaves...

48:14.016 --> 48:15.933
"dissolved at last...

48:16.018 --> 48:18.227
"in the darkness
of the mossy earth.

48:19.730 --> 48:23.441
"Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers...

48:23.525 --> 48:28.029
but their scent lingered
to honey the air he breathed."

49:01.813 --> 49:03.856
There's a woman
to see you. Ma'am.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.275
A woman and not a lady, Annie?

49:06.360 --> 49:09.362
- She won't give her name.
- Well. Ask her to come up.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.322
She says she won't come up.

49:11.406 --> 49:14.408
Well, then we shall
have to go down.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.960
- Good afternoon.
- I'm looking for my husband.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.796
Here? Thankyou, Annie.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.966
I have my reasons to believe
that he is here.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.343
[Exhales] Well, you're
welcome to search for him.

49:32.427 --> 49:34.762
I'm so sorry.
Your husband's name?

49:34.846 --> 49:37.473
Leonard Bast.
As I'm sure you're aware of.

49:37.557 --> 49:40.434
Margaret. Are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard Bast?

49:42.980 --> 49:44.897
There appears to have been
some mistake. Mrs. Bast.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.650
I do not think we are acquainted
with your husband.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.860
Oh, no. There's no mistake.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.154
I know for a fact
that he has visited in this house.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.658
- He had his tea here.
- That is a grave allegation.

49:55.742 --> 49:58.536
Yes. To have corrupted
a married man with giving him tea.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.287
I wish we could help you. Mrs. Bast.

50:00.372 --> 50:02.456
It seems you can't...

50:02.541 --> 50:04.208
or won't...

50:04.292 --> 50:06.711
except to have a laugh at my expense.

50:06.795 --> 50:08.838
So I'm very sorry
to have troubled you...

50:08.922 --> 50:11.007
and wish you
a very good afternoon.

50:16.388 --> 50:19.348
You do what you can for the house.
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.434
If you start smoking too,
the house might be even more musty.

50:21.518 --> 50:23.644
I doubt it.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.396
This is lovely. Annie.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.106
There's a Mr. Leonard Bast.

50:27.190 --> 50:30.192
- Oh, no! I don't believe it.
- [Laughing] The missing husband.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.820
- He must be brought in immediately.
- The one you corrupted with tea?

50:32.904 --> 50:35.364
- I'll do the host.
- Thank you.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.908
Mr. Bast, come this way.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.745
Do come in, Mr. Bast.
Good evening.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.997
Good evening. Do come in
and have some pudding with us.

50:43.081 --> 50:46.083
- Yes. Or would you prefer some dinner?
- I've had my tea. Thank you.

50:46.168 --> 50:48.794
- Have a chair. A glass of wine?
- No.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.629
- Port?
- No, thank you.

50:50.714 --> 50:52.923
Well. Do take a seat
in any case. Mr. Bast...

50:53.008 --> 50:55.301
and let us know
how we can help you.

51:00.724 --> 51:03.059
You wouldn't remember
giving me this?

51:04.061 --> 51:07.188
- Not as such.
- Well. That was how it happened. You see.

51:07.272 --> 51:09.940
- Uh. What?
- Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

51:10.025 --> 51:11.567
For the moment.
I don't remember.

51:11.651 --> 51:15.863
It was more than a year ago.
At the Ethical Society.

51:15.947 --> 51:17.698
The lecture was
on "Music and Meaning."

51:17.783 --> 51:20.451
Oh, I see. So the mistake arose
out of my card. Did it?

51:20.535 --> 51:24.497
The lady who called here yesterday
thought you were calling as well
and that she would find you here.

51:25.832 --> 51:29.293
In the afternoon. I said to my wife —
I said to Mrs. Bast —

51:29.377 --> 51:33.172
"I have to pay a call on some friends."
And Mrs. Bast said to me. "Do go."

51:33.256 --> 51:37.468
But while I was gone, she wanted me
on important business...

51:37.552 --> 51:40.387
and thought I had come here.
Owing to the card.

51:40.472 --> 51:42.640
And I beg to tender
my apologies. And hers too...

51:42.724 --> 51:44.850
for any inconvenience
we may have caused you.

51:44.935 --> 51:47.937
- None at all, truly.
- I still don't understand.

51:48.021 --> 51:50.940
When did you say you paid this call.
This afternoon call?

51:51.024 --> 51:53.317
In the afternoon, of course.

51:53.401 --> 51:55.361
Saturday afternoon or Sunday?

51:56.446 --> 51:57.947
- Saturday.
- Really?

51:58.031 --> 52:02.993
And you were still calling on Sunday
when your wife came here? A long visit.

52:03.078 --> 52:05.246
[Margaret] It was very good of you
to come explain, Mr. Bast.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.748
The rest is naturally
no concern of ours.

52:07.833 --> 52:11.210
We are going to go upstairs for coffee.
I do hope that you will join us.

52:12.879 --> 52:15.422
- Annie. Pour the coffee. Please.
- It's not what you think.

52:17.467 --> 52:19.135
I was —

52:20.345 --> 52:23.222
I left my office and walked...

52:23.306 --> 52:25.349
right out of London.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.518
I was walking
all Saturday night.

52:27.602 --> 52:30.646
All night? In the dark?

52:30.730 --> 52:32.523
It got so dark
I couldn't see my own hand.

52:32.607 --> 52:36.610
Mr. Bast,
you must be a born explorer.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.197
I tried to steer by the polestar.
But once out of doors...

52:40.282 --> 52:41.907
everything gets so mixed
and I lost it.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.034
Don't tell me about the polestar.
I know its little ways.

52:44.119 --> 52:46.954
It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.964
[Helen] Yes, but why?

52:57.048 --> 52:59.800
Why didyou do it?

52:59.885 --> 53:01.552
I wanted to...

53:01.636 --> 53:03.554
just walk...

53:03.638 --> 53:05.931
just get out.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.766
I've been reading
The Ordeal ofRichard Feverel.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.811
Yes, I remember. There's that chapter
where Richard walks all night.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.480
- In a forest by moonlight.
- Yes. Margaret. What's that wonderful —

53:13.565 --> 53:16.483
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.

53:16.568 --> 53:20.279
[Both]
"The forest drooped glimmeringly."

53:20.363 --> 53:22.364
Wait, I'll get it.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.450
The chapter's called "Nature Speaks."

53:24.534 --> 53:28.204
- Where do your people come from?
- London.

53:28.288 --> 53:30.372
Yes. I know, but I mean before that.

53:30.457 --> 53:33.667
They didn't always
live in a town.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.920
No. They came
from around Shropshire.

53:36.004 --> 53:38.297
They worked on the land.

53:38.381 --> 53:40.049
They were agricultural laborers.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.218
There. You see?

53:42.302 --> 53:44.511
It was ancestral voices calling you.

53:47.015 --> 53:48.933
Yes. Here it is.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.352
"Richard was walking hurriedly.

53:51.436 --> 53:55.231
"A pale gray light on the skirts of
the flying tempest displayed the dawn."

53:55.315 --> 53:57.775
- Did you see the dawn?
- Yes, suddenly it got light.

53:57.859 --> 54:00.486
- And was it wonderful?
- No.

54:00.570 --> 54:03.405
- [Laughing]
- It was only gray.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.658
And anyway, by that time
I was so tired and so hungry.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.409
I didn't know when you're walking...

54:07.494 --> 54:10.246
you want a breakfast and lunch and tea
during the night as well...

54:10.330 --> 54:14.041
- and all I had was a packet ofWoodbines.
- [All Chuckling]

54:16.002 --> 54:18.128
[Woman]
No. Money. Give Mr. Bast money.

54:18.213 --> 54:21.548
- We really must go. Meg. Come on.
- Don't bother about his ideals.

54:21.633 --> 54:25.135
Your Leonard Bast wouldn't know
what to do if you just gave him money.

54:25.220 --> 54:28.847
Nonsense. Money is very educational.
Much more so than the things it buys.

54:28.932 --> 54:31.267
Such crass materialism
out of your mouth, Margaret.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.477
Give them money.
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

54:33.561 --> 54:35.688
[All Chattering, Indistinct]

54:35.772 --> 54:38.816
What if he gained the whole world.
But lost his own soul?

54:38.900 --> 54:42.278
But he won't gain his soul until
he has enough money to do it with.

54:42.362 --> 54:43.821
Give Mr. Bast money.

54:43.905 --> 54:47.283
[All Chattering, Indistinct]

54:47.367 --> 54:49.660
Good night.
Yes. Well. You worry about the first.

54:49.744 --> 54:52.496
Good-bye. Good-bye.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.999
Thank you.

54:55.083 --> 54:57.001
- Good night.
- Good night.

55:00.547 --> 55:03.882
[Tango]

55:09.139 --> 55:12.975
So what do you think is the most
important thing in the world, then?

55:13.059 --> 55:15.686
Well, I suppose...

55:15.770 --> 55:19.356
- it is whatever matters to you most.
- What, like love, for instance?

55:19.441 --> 55:22.818
- Yes, like love for instance
or Oxford if you're Tibby.
- Miss Schlegel?

55:22.902 --> 55:24.820
- Henry Wilcox.
- Oh, hello.

55:24.904 --> 55:27.364
- Hello. Good evening.
- How nice to see you.

55:27.449 --> 55:30.117
What a wonderful surprise.
I heard two ladies talking of love.

55:30.201 --> 55:33.871
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.
- No. We were continuing
a serious discussion.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.623
- Yes?
- Yes. We belong to a sort of club...

55:36.708 --> 55:39.543
which meets once a week
to discuss various subjects.

55:39.627 --> 55:43.547
How are you? I would've thought
you would be down at Howards End.

55:43.631 --> 55:46.258
Howards End is let.
We've bought a house in Mayfair.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.594
Yes. Mr. Wilcox, supposing
you were a millionaire.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.180
Oh, but I expect you are one.
[Chuckles]

55:51.264 --> 55:55.559
We have met a young man who is very poor
and we think sensitive and intelligent...

55:55.643 --> 55:58.979
and we wondered if one was a millionaire
how one could help him.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.815
- What's his profession?
- He's a clerk in — What was it. Margaret?

56:01.900 --> 56:04.693
- The Porphyrion Fire I nsurance Company.
- I nsurance.

56:04.778 --> 56:07.404
- Porphyrion?
- Yes.

56:07.489 --> 56:10.157
Ah, then Miss Schlegel...

56:10.241 --> 56:12.242
if I were to help
your young clerk...

56:12.327 --> 56:15.204
I'd advise him to clear out of
the Porphyrion with all possible speed.

56:15.288 --> 56:17.206
- Why?
- Now, this is between friends...

56:17.290 --> 56:20.209
but the Porphyrion is
insufficiently reinsured.

56:20.293 --> 56:22.419
It'll be in the receivers' hands
before Christmas.

56:22.504 --> 56:24.338
In other words. It will smash.

56:24.422 --> 56:27.091
Do you hear? Helen.
The Porphyrion will smash.

56:27.175 --> 56:29.301
We'll have to warn Mr. Bast.
He'll have to get another place.

56:29.386 --> 56:32.888
- I hope he'll get one very quickly.
- But rather than wait to make sure?

56:32.972 --> 56:35.933
Yes. Decidedly. You understand.
The man who is already in a situation...

56:36.017 --> 56:37.935
when he applies for work...

56:38.019 --> 56:39.937
stands a much better chance. Naturally.

56:40.021 --> 56:42.022
This is letting you
into state secrets, of course...

56:42.107 --> 56:45.567
but, uh. It does affect
an employer greatly.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.277
Human nature, I'm afraid.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.696
Well. Our human nature appears
to be quite the other way around.

56:49.781 --> 56:52.449
We employ people
because they're unemployed —

56:52.534 --> 56:54.660
- The bootman, for instance.
- How does he clean the boots?

56:54.744 --> 56:56.662
- Not well.
- There you are.

56:56.746 --> 57:00.416
Mr. Wilcox, is it very difficult nowadays
for a clerk to get a situation?

57:00.500 --> 57:03.293
- Yes. Extremely.
- I'm so sorry about Howards End.

57:03.378 --> 57:06.046
- Hmm?
- I mean that you're not living there.

57:06.131 --> 57:11.135
I think I have some idea of how much
her house meant to Mrs. Wilcox.

57:11.219 --> 57:14.096
Yes. But to us. The family.
It has certain drawbacks.

57:14.180 --> 57:18.475
Would you be able to help?
Our friend. Help him to a new situation?

57:18.560 --> 57:22.479
Well, unfortunately. We have very few
positions and vacancies.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.606
And when there is one. Of course...

57:24.691 --> 57:27.901
- always hundreds of applicants.
- Of course.

57:27.986 --> 57:29.903
- It has been a pleasure. Miss Schlegel.
- Yes, indeed.

57:29.988 --> 57:33.490
Miss Schlegel. I hope
your young clerk finds success.

57:33.575 --> 57:36.869
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

57:36.953 --> 57:39.538
Well, he was in a hurry
to get away. Wasn't he?

57:43.126 --> 57:46.628
- Ah. Wilcox.
- What was all that about?

57:49.757 --> 57:51.675
Mr. Bast...

57:51.759 --> 57:54.845
I fear you may have thought
our letter a little odd.

57:54.929 --> 57:57.723
We're not odd. Really.
We're just over-expressive. That's all.

57:57.807 --> 58:01.018
The more a lady has to say, the better.
Ladies brighten every conversation.

58:01.102 --> 58:05.272
Yes. I know. The darlings are regular
sunbeams. Let me give you a plate.

58:05.356 --> 58:11.028
Your company is the Porphyrion. Isn't it?
Would you call it a solid concern?

58:11.112 --> 58:14.573
Cake? This big one
or one of these little deadlies?

58:14.657 --> 58:17.159
It depends what you mean by solid.

58:17.243 --> 58:19.745
We were told the Porphyrion's a no-go.

58:19.829 --> 58:22.623
A friend of ours did think...

58:22.707 --> 58:26.710
- that it's insufficiently reinsured.
- And advised you to clear out.

58:26.794 --> 58:30.881
- You can tell your friend that he's wrong.
- Oh. Good! [Chuckling]

58:30.965 --> 58:33.300
Wrong. So to speak.

58:33.384 --> 58:36.053
How, so to speak?

58:36.137 --> 58:38.138
I mean, I wouldn't say
he was right altogether.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.307
Then he is right partly?

58:41.476 --> 58:44.603
Tell your friend to mind
his own business.

58:44.687 --> 58:46.980
- [Knocking, Door Opens]
- Annie.

58:47.065 --> 58:49.816
Mr. Wilcox, Miss Wilcox.

58:49.901 --> 58:51.860
Oh.

58:51.945 --> 58:54.905
- What a surprise!
- [Helen Laughing]

58:54.989 --> 58:57.950
Oh, they're beautiful.

58:58.034 --> 59:02.246
- Mr. Wilcox. Do come in.
- Miss Schlegel, pray forgive us
for calling so unexpectedly.

59:02.330 --> 59:07.501
- Mr. Bast. Come play with puppies.
- Mr. Wilcox. This is Mr. Bast.

59:07.585 --> 59:09.670
- Aren't they beautiful?
- I must be going.

59:09.754 --> 59:11.672
Oh, must you really?

59:11.756 --> 59:12.881
Oh, come again.

59:12.966 --> 59:15.175
No. I shan't. I shan't come again.

59:17.011 --> 59:20.973
I call that a very rude remark. What do
you want to turn on me like that for?

59:21.057 --> 59:24.434
I thought you invited me here as —
for a friendly chat.

59:24.519 --> 59:27.187
Instead it turns out you want to pick
my brains about my place of business.

59:27.272 --> 59:29.773
Oh. Yes. "Send for him.
Cross-question him. Pick his brains."

59:29.857 --> 59:32.859
- No. No!
- Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel?
Shall we go?

59:32.944 --> 59:35.195
No. No. Thank you.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.698
Helen, go after him. Explain.

59:44.247 --> 59:47.749
- What was all that about?
- I knew I shouldn't have come.

59:47.834 --> 59:50.294
It was all right last time,
but things like that always get spoiled.

59:50.378 --> 59:52.879
Things do. But people don't.

59:52.964 --> 59:54.464
Don't you understand?

59:54.549 --> 59:56.842
We really did want to warn you
about the Porphyrion.

59:56.926 --> 59:59.219
We were worried about you.

59:59.304 --> 01:00:02.973
- Why should you worry about me?
- Because we like you.

01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:06.518
That's why...

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.478
you noodle.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:13.859
- There's no cause to call a person names.
- Yes. There is when a person is being
tremendously stupid.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.154
[Sighs]
Oh, listen. This is serious.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:20.157
Our friend said you should be
looking around for another post now...

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.867
before anything happens.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.119
- Will you?
- I'll think about it.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:26.330
No. You must do more than think.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:30.250
You must search for another place
while you still have one.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:34.671
Now, promise you will
do that at least. Please.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:38.091
All right. Thank you.
Miss Schlegel.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.638
Come and tell us when you've found
another place, or just come anyway.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.891
And don't say no.
Don't dare to say no.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:50.729
And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.572
You ought to be more careful. Miss Schlegel.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.824
Your servants ought to have orders
not to let such people in.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.910
Oh, but we invited him in.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:08.664
Yes. We wanted to see him again,
and talk to him and maybe help him...

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:11.875
- not only in a practical way.
- You're too kind.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:15.045
You behave too well to people
and then they impose on you.

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:17.089
I know the world and that type of man.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.174
Oh, but he is not a type. Mr. Wilcox.

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:22.719
- [Chuckles]
- No. I think he is a quite
unusualyoung man.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:25.138
And he has something in him.
I don't know what it is.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:28.558
Except that he wants
something better than he's got.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.019
- Oh.
- Yes.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.188
He has a sort of romantic ambition.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.984
It is your view of him
that is romantic. Miss Schlegel.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:43.782
Evie.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.535
We wish you to have something
to remember Mrs. Wilcox by...

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:48.704
in return for your kindness
to her in those days.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.957
Oh, thank you so much.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.875
What a lovely thought.
Thank you.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.461
She would want you to have it.
She spoke very fondly of you.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.840
It's beautiful.
Are you sure?

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.634
Is it 18th century?
It must be crystal.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.803
Thank you. Thank you. Evie.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.934
- So what does she look like?
- A sort of an old-maid type.

01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:12.936
Goodness knows why Father
wanted me to ask her.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.730
She talks and talks —
Here she is.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:17.774
- Miss Schlegel.
- Hello. Miss Wilcox.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.235
How do you do?
This is my fiance, Percy Cahill.

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.987
How do you do?

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:28.034
- Ah, good afternoon.
- Hello. I didn't expect to see you.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.121
Well. Evie told me of her little plot,
so I just slipped in and secured a table.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.622
Always secure a table first.
Evie, sit there.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.625
- Miss Schlegel. If you please. Here.
- Thank you very much.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:38.503
Mr. Cahill, there.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:42.549
Well, are you still worrying around
after your young clerks?

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.968
- I hope you're hungry.
- Famished. I want to eat heaps.

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:47.095
Good. What will you have?

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.973
- Fish pie.
- Ah. Fish pie.

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:53.560
Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.
It's not a good thing to go for here.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:56.563
- Go for something for me then.
- Right. Uh...

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.026
roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding and...

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.778
- What will you have?
- Cider to drink.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.613
- That's the type of thing to go for.
- I'll have trout.

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:06.615
I like this place for a joke
once in a while.

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.742
It's so thoroughly old English.
Don't you agree?

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.914
I began an inventory
of our possessions.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:16.041
There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone —

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.793
Oh, thank you. Lovely.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:21.254
And that's not counting the books.
Whatever shall I do?

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:24.341
- You see, modern ownership ofmoveables...
- [Whispering] I told you.

01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:26.551
- Is reducing us again to a nomadic hoard.
- How awful.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.596
We are reverting to a civilization
of luggage, Mr. Wilcox.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.516
- [Chuckling]
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Sir.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.727
Always tip the carver.
Tip everywhere is my motto.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.397
- Perhaps it does make life more human.
- Then these fellows remember one again.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.983
Especially in the East.
If you tip. They remember you
from year's end to year's end.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.945
- Have you been in the East?
- Yes, Greece and the Levant.

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:47.864
I used to go for sport
and business to Cyprus.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.951
A few piastres properly distributed
help to keep one's memory green.

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:54.371
- [Margaret] How shockingly cynical.
- Not a bit. Simply realistic.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:55.997
Excuse me. Sir.
How would you like your beef done?

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:57.749
- Well done.
- Well done.

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:02.629
You don't like cheese.
You never take cheese.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:04.631
- Percy, I adore cheese.
- You said you didn't like it.

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:08.218
That's the most despicable lie. Percy.
You've gone quite pink.

01:04:08.302 --> 01:04:11.179
- I haven't gone pink.
- Your ears have gone pink about the tips.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.889
- I have not.
- [Henry] Evie, I like that.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.600
Miss Schlegel expects me to act
as house agent for her.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.688
[Chuckling]
I want a new home in September.
And someone must find it. I can't.

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:21.648
Do you know of anything, Percy?

01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:23.400
Can't say I do.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:25.819
I wish you would give us Howards End.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.701
- Howards End, I'm afraid, is let.
- Can't you turn out your tenant
and let it to us?

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:34.286
No.

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.790
[Sighs]
We're nearly demented.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.710
Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.883
One bit of advice: Fix your district.
Fix your price, then don't budge.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.969
That's how I got Ducie Street
and Oniton.

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.598
Well, I shall, uh —

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.142
I shall look around a bit for you.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.895
- Would you?
- Yes.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.856
- Wouldyou really? How kind.
- Yes.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.650
But I warn you.
The house has not been built...

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.903
that would suit the Schlegel family.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.614
- It's no fun trying to help us.
- Fun?

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.616
No. But it's a pleasure
and a privilege...

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.035
to do whatever I can
for Miss Margaret Schlegel.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:19.664
Thank you very much.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.083
[Henry]
Dear Miss Schlegel...

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.294
dare I intrude
on your holiday in Devon...

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:26.296
and request you
to come up to London...

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.924
where, I may add,
you are greatly missed?

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.926
Matter is ofsome urgency.

01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:35.138
But to interrupt your holiday.
Dear Margaret...

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:37.766
and before we have
undertaken our excursions.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.477
You haven't been
to Nine Barrows Downs.

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:43.438
I know. Aunt Juley,
But I shall be back before long.

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.607
Let me go up to town today...

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.734
and take the house
if it's the least bit possible.

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.736
I don't understand.
Whose house is this?

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.155
Mr. Wilcox's, Tibby.
You are being remarkably obtuse.

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:54.157
Are you doing it on purpose?

01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:56.201
Look. "Owing to
changed circumstances" —

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.703
He means that Evie's getting married.
That's his daughter.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.957
"I no longer have need
for a London house of this size...

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.167
and am willing to let it
on a yearly tenancy."

01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:07.087
- That's perfect.
- Out of all our hotel acquaintances...

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:11.299
Mr. Wilcox is the only one who's stuck,
yet we've met far more interesting people.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.010
Interesting people
don't get one houses.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.554
I shall never forget
that dreadful motor driver...

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.556
that perfectly dreadful Charles.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.769
My one consolation is that for once
I was able to be useful to you girls.

01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:25.271
Thank you. Aunt Juley.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:29.317
And now it is
my turn to be useful.

01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:06.604
This is the ballroom.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.024
Goodness. Oh.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.736
- Like it?
- Rather!

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.322
Even I know a good thing
when I see it.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:23.705
Yes. But nowadays, with. Uh,
Evie always out with her fiance...

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:26.583
when I get home in the evenings.
I tell you I can't stand the place.

01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:29.836
- It would be very lonely for you.
- Yes.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.673
Do you ever get lonely, Miss Schlegel?

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.675
I soon shall, horribly.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.679
It's heartbreaking
to leave one's old home.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:44.184
Goodness. How high
this ceiling must be.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:47.437
H mm?
Yes. It must be over 30 feet.

01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:50.356
No. Maybe 40, I should think.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.609
Perhaps even more.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.865
Miss Schlegel. Uh...

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:01.493
I've had you here
on false pretenses.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.579
I want to speak on a much more
serious matter than the house.

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:08.208
Uh...

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:15.048
do you think you could
be induced to share?

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:17.509
I mean, is it at all
probable that —

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.886
Oh, yes. I see.

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:28.645
Miss Schlegel.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.814
Margaret.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:34.399
- I don't think you quite understand.
- Oh, yes. I ndeed. Yes.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:40.031
- I'm asking you to be my wife.
- Yes. I know. I know.

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:43.076
- Are you offended?
- How could I be?

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.161
Well, perhaps I should've written first.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:49.082
No. No. Rather, you will
receive a letter from me.

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.084
- Thankyou.
- Not at all.

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:52.794
And it's you I thank.

01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:57.256
Uh...

01:08:58.425 --> 01:09:00.926
should I order
the motor round now?

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.055
That would be most kind.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.420
[Charles] Warning you, Evie,
she will never set foot in this house!

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.923
- [Evie] It's not my fault!
- Of course it's your fault.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.466
Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.886
- Girls? They're hardly girls.
- [Thunder Rumbling]

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.890
I never dreamt of such a thing.
Dad took me to call...

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.852
and then made me
ask her to Simpson's, that's all.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:52.645
Well, I'm altogether off Dad.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:56.065
- [Baby Crying]
- You've woken didums. I knew you would.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.612
Well. Miss Schlegel's
fairly got us on toast.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.865
You know. She always meant
to get hold of Howards End.

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:06.910
Now. Thanks to you. She's got it.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:10.580
- I call that most unfair.
- Oh. Evie.

01:10:10.664 --> 01:10:12.582
Why don't you pretend
to break off your engagement?

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:16.127
Then perhaps your father will
also quarrel with Miss Schlegel.

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:20.298
- Stop talking nonsense, darling.
- I'm jolly well going to get married
as soon as possible.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:24.344
- And Dad can do what he likes.
- She's taking Mother's place.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:30.183
- The idea!
- I could simply scratch
that woman's eyes out.

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:33.436
- Toto. Toto, play.
- Come on, Dolly.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.272
I'll have a try.
Come on.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.691
Well, it's no use talking.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.861
We're in a bad hole
and must make the best of it.

01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:46.616
But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.243
And if I find them putting on airs...

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:52.497
- with their artistic beastliness...
- [Baby Continues Crying]

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.499
I intend to put my foot down.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:58.252
- Yes, firmly.
- [Thunderclap]

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.812
[Henry]
I've had a letter too. Not a nice one.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.814
I want to talk it over with you.

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:21.609
My letter is about Howards End.
The tenants have decamped.

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.446
And what is worse, he's trying
to sublet the house, Margaret.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.157
Here, he's trying to sublet the house.
What are you laughing at?

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:30.159
Henry...

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.412
you haven't had a chance
for a talk with Helen yet, have you?

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:35.331
- What do you mean, a talk with her?
- Well, do before you go.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.208
- Why? What's the matter?
- Oh. Nothing.

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:41.129
- I'm just anxious you two should be friends.
- We've always hit it off together.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:43.172
- [Margaret] Shh.
- Well, we do.

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.550
There's no clause in the agreement
to allow subletting.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:48.136
There you are. Read it yourself.
That's awfully jolly.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.431
- Thank you.
- Yes. Especially that. Foxgloves.

01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:53.433
Yes. Dear old digitalis.

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:57.103
- Digitalis, sounds like a sneeze.
- [Chuckling]

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:02.525
- Margaret! Such nice news from Mr. Bast.
- Really? Good.

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.069
Here we all are then.

01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:08.698
- Mr. Bast is now with Dempster's Bank.
That's his news.
- Good.

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:11.868
Thanks to your hint,
he cleared out of the Porphyrion.

01:12:11.952 --> 01:12:14.412
Not a bad business, the Porphyrion.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.831
Margaret. I shall have to go
to Howards End and take charge.

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:19.542
- And I would like you to come with me.
- Not a bad business?

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:22.336
- Yes, I would like that very much.
- Good. What about tomorrow?

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:25.214
- Tomorrow? Oh. No. I couldn't well do that.
- Why not?

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.383
You told us the Porphyrion
would smash before Christmas.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:29.093
Did I? Yes.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.554
Well. It was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

01:12:31.638 --> 01:12:33.556
Took some rather bad policies.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.809
But, uh. Lately, it came in.
Safe as houses now.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.561
What's wrong with tomorrow?

01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:40.730
Aunt Juley would be
so disappointed if I left now.

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:45.318
- Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us
that the Porphyrion would —
- Yes, let's talk about it later, shall we?

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:49.405
- Henry, Aunt Juley regards
this visit as a high solemnity —
- It turns out that it's safe as houses.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.574
And Mr. Bast need never have left
and taken another post...

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:54.827
- at a greatly reduced salary.
- My dear Helen.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.413
I grieve for your clerk, I really do.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.499
But it is all part
of the battle of life.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.084
- Battle of life?
- Yes.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.211
A man who had little money
has less. Owing to us.

01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:06.172
Oh, come, come. You're not to blame.
No one is to blame.

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:09.592
- No one? Is no one to blame for anything?
- I didn't say that.

01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:12.512
- You take things far too seriously.
- [AuntJuley] Margaret.

01:13:12.596 --> 01:13:13.805
There's your aunt.
I'll go and have a word with her.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:16.349
- [AuntJuley] Margaret!
- Helen.

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:19.018
Helen, a word of advice.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.853
I require no more advice.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:24.273
Don't take up a sentimental
attitude over the poor.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.025
See that she doesn't, Margaret.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:30.488
The poor are poor.
One is sorry for them, but there it is.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.199
I'll talk to Aunt Juley about tomorrow.
Don't you bother.

01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:35.701
[Aunt Juley]
Girls, aren't you cold?

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:41.833
Helen, I am very sorry about Mr. Bast.
But you must be civil to Henry.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:46.295
- You yourself are a witness.
- Yes, I know there may be another side
to this question.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:50.633
But Henry is my future husband...

01:13:50.717 --> 01:13:52.885
and I must be on his side.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:58.182
Why are you so bitter, dearie?

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:01.435
- Hmm?
- Because I'm an old maid.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.188
Oh, Helen.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.232
No. Darling.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.362
Helen!

01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:16.325
- Margaret will explain.
- Margaret. Magsy.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.828
If it isn't true surely
what Mr. Wilcox is saying...

01:14:18.912 --> 01:14:21.914
- that you want to go away tomorrow?
- Yes, we must leave tomorrow.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.584
[Henry]
I have business at Howards End...

01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:27.420
and my business is now also,
unfortunately, my Margaret's.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:30.298
[Margaret] So we'll go
for our walk now. See you at tea time.

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:33.176
Unless it rains. In which case.
We'll see you a great deal sooner. Bye.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.469
Have a good walk.

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:50.860
- Yes. That's him.
- [Margaret] So this is the famous office?

01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:53.237
- What?
- I'd expected something more African.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.239
Oh, heavens. No.
[Laughs]

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:59.744
Spears, animal skins and that sort of thing.
But I suppose this is the imperial part...

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.163
of the Imperial and West African
Rubber Company.

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:04.874
Yes. We haven't settled the question
of the London house, have we?

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:07.126
- Well. It all depends, doesn't it?
- On what?

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.545
- When do you want to marry me?
- [Chuckles] How you do fly around.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:13.299
- My head's in a whirl. Let's dance!
- [Both Laughing]

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:16.010
- [Margaret] Be careful!
- [Henry Vocalizing]

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.265
- Oh, Charles.
- I hope that my wife —

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.559
How do you do —
will give you a decent lunch...

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:25.811
after you've had a good look
at Howards End.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.731
I can hardly wait to see it,
although I almost feel I have.

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:30.942
I don't know
in what state you'll find it.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:35.863
The tenant decamped without even arranging
for a charwoman to clear up after him.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.659
- Oh, dear.
- Yes. I've more than a little bone
to pick with that tenant.

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:43.287
- Margaret, here's an idea.
- Yes?

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:46.958
Why don't we use Howards End to store
your furniture from Wickham Place...

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.043
tillyou decide what to do with it?

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.504
- Oh, wouldyou? Wouldyou really?
- Good idea?

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.506
Oh, how kind.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.133
Only until Helen and Tibby
are settled of course, Charles.

01:15:58.011 --> 01:16:02.515
I hope you won't be disappointed.
It's quite a measly little place.

01:16:02.599 --> 01:16:06.644
- Never really suited us.
- Heavens, no.

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:31.794
[Dolly Coughs]

01:16:31.878 --> 01:16:33.796
- Oh. It's lovely.
- Margaret.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.548
- Oh. Dear.
- What?

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:37.550
- I seem to have forgotten the keys.
- What?

01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:39.802
- I've lost the keys.
- Crane. We'll have to go back.

01:16:39.886 --> 01:16:41.512
- Won't you leave me here?
- You sure?

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:45.099
Yes, yes. I'll wait for you. Dolly.
Have a nice glass of milk at the farm.

01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:49.729
Henry. See that she gets a nice glass
of milk. I'll walk around in the garden.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.608
[Margaret] Good-bye.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:56.861
- Why did you forget the key?
- I'm sorry. I don't know.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:17:00.656
- Where did you leave it?
- Well. It could be with didums.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.658
[Indistinct]

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:23.489
[Thumping]

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.997
Hello?

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.710
I took you for Ruth Wilcox.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.380
I, like Mrs. Wilcox?

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:43.384
You have her way of walking...

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.554
round the house.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.394
[Chuckles]

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:41.984
Henry!

01:19:42.068 --> 01:19:43.986
Henry, I've found the teeth.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.988
- Yes, what?
- The pigs' teeth.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:49.033
- Teeth? Where?
- The pigs' teeth in the bark.

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.285
Yes. look. Just here.

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:53.704
You see? Four feet up.

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.789
- How extraordinary.
- Yes, and you chew the bark...

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:58.501
- to cure the toothache.
- What a rum notion.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.294
Surely, you knew that.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:03.631
Did that silly old Miss Avery
give you a fright. Margaret?

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:06.342
None of you girls has any nerve.
[Laughing]

01:20:06.426 --> 01:20:08.761
Did you take her for a spook?
She's very odd.

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:11.222
She carries on as if
she owned Howards End.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.224
Miss Avery has always
lived on the place?

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:16.185
Yes. She grew up there
on the farm like Mrs. Wilcox.

01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:19.897
Weren't she and Mrs. Wilcox friends
when Howards End too was a farm?

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.484
They do say that Mrs. Wilcox
had a brother, or was it an uncle?

01:20:23.568 --> 01:20:27.530
Anyhow, he popped the question.
And Miss Avery. She said no.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:31.450
Just imagine if she'd said yes.
She'd have been Charles's aunt.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:34.578
Oh, I say, that's rather good.
Charlie's aunt.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.622
I must chaff him about that.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.835
[Dolly]
She's so mad about Howards End.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.297
Goodness knows what she'll do when
your furniture gets there, Margaret.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.716
She might fling it all out.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:50.469
Or she might simply adopt it
for Howards End.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.350
Excuse me. Sir. Where would I go
to inquire about a position?

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.519
What position
would that be, sir?

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:42.563
I heard there was one.

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:44.565
Not at this time.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.842
I thought it was you.
How do you do?

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:15.304
Why did you never come
to see us again? You promised.

01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:17.681
But this isn't your bank.
You took a situation with Dempster's.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.684
- I lost it.
- Sorry?

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.187
I lost the situation.

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.773
They cut back on their staff and
the last to join, like me...

01:22:25.857 --> 01:22:27.900
were the first to be let go.

01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:30.819
I've been inquiring
for another place here.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:33.364
The way they look at you
when you come to ask.

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:37.159
They're sure you've stolen something or why else
would any decent person be out of work?

01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:39.078
- It's our fault.
- No.

01:22:39.162 --> 01:22:42.373
No. We made you leave the Porphyrion.
I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox...

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:45.459
who is at this very moment
celebrating his daughter's wedding...

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.002
at his castle in Shropshire...

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:49.129
with the maximum expense
and ostentation. Of course.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.131
I could murder him!

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:55.469
"Murder will out, it is most foul."

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.389
How have you been, Miss Schlegel?
Any interesting lectures?

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:02.351
You know. He jolly well
owes you a situation.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:08.607
[Margaret] What nice houses you have
all over the place. I like this one too.

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:11.694
[Henry] Oniton Grange.
Waiting to get it offmy hands.

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:13.696
- Why?
- Well, what is one to do?

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.948
The shooting is bad
and the fishing is even worse.

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:18.450
Anyway, it's in the wrong
part ofShropshire.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:21.036
Henry, are these all Wilcoxes?

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.746
Heavens, no.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.748
I bought the place
lock, stock and barrel.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.293
The fellow just took the money
and cleared off to Italy, I think.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:30.713
I'm told some of these are rather good.
What do you think?

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.756
- I think they're lovely.
- Rather good, isn't it?

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.758
- Which one?
- Top one.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.594
- Yes, very grand. It's rather like you.
- [Chuckles]

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.598
So, I'll show you the cellar.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.937
- It's very damp. Isn't it?
- [Chattering, Laughing]

01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:54.737
- Uh. Do you have enough ice now?
- Yes. Sir.

01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:56.447
- Second orders?
- Yes. Sir.

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.574
- Good. All right.
- Good afternoon.

01:23:58.658 --> 01:24:01.118
- It's this way.
- Right.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.162
Thank you.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:07.958
It is difficult to decide what to do
about the children. Yes. Here we are.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.587
Charles, as the eldest.
Will someday have Howards End.

01:24:11.671 --> 01:24:13.672
I'm just anxious not to be
unjust to the others.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:15.841
Of course not.
You mean money?

01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:18.260
- Yes, money. Since you put it so frankly.
- Goodness.

01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:20.679
We'll never get through all this wine.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:23.098
- How much have you got?
- What?

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.309
How much have you got
a year? I have 600.

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:27.311
My income?

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:29.730
- Don't you know your income? [Laughing]
- Of course I do.

01:24:29.814 --> 01:24:32.399
Don't you want to tell it me?

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.110
Do it this way. If you were to
divide your income into 10 parts...

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:38.530
how many parts would you give
to Charles. To Evie and to Paul?

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:41.617
Go ahead. Give away
all you can. Be generous.

01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:43.619
You don't beat
about the bush, do you?

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:46.163
- [Chuckles]
- No.

01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:02.221
[Charles] I suppose she'll get her hands
on this place as well as Howards End.

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:05.307
It's only her furniture
that's gone there.

01:25:05.391 --> 01:25:07.893
That's the thin edge
of the wedge.

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:14.858
I don't know what's to happen to us, Dolly.
Two children to bring up.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.529
Charles, you are pleased
about the baby. Aren't you?

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:22.324
What?
Oh, pleased as punch.

01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:25.994
Pleased as punch.

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:32.835
Though it's not
going to be easy.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:36.797
The pater wants to be fair.
But money isn't elastic.

01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:39.508
What if Evie has a family?

01:25:39.592 --> 01:25:41.635
- Or the pater himself?
- [Chuckles]

01:25:41.719 --> 01:25:43.637
- What?
- Shh.

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:50.102
Who's there?

01:25:52.063 --> 01:25:54.982
Saxon or Celt?

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.282
[All Chattering]

01:26:10.456 --> 01:26:13.584
Evie! Good-bye!

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.838
Good-bye!

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:20.382
It went like clockwork.

01:26:21.634 --> 01:26:23.552
"Quite like a Durbar."
Lady Edser said.

01:26:23.636 --> 01:26:26.972
Ah. You did awfully well.

01:26:27.056 --> 01:26:30.350
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:32.644
It was very successful.

01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.730
- [Henry] Who are those people?
- [Margaret] Well...

01:26:34.814 --> 01:26:37.649
perhaps they're townspeople
come to see the wedding presents.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:41.069
If you'll gracefully vanish,
I'll deal with them.

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:52.414
What is it?
What's wrong? Is Tibby ill?

01:26:52.498 --> 01:26:54.333
They're starving!
I found them starving!

01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:56.335
- Who's starving?
- The Basts.

01:26:56.419 --> 01:26:58.670
He's lost his place because he's been
turned out of Dempster's bank.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:01.882
They reduced their staff,
and he was the first to go.

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:03.842
Yes. Thanks to us, he's done for.

01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:05.761
- We've ruined him.
- Are you mad?

01:27:05.845 --> 01:27:08.180
If you like. I'm mad.
But I'll stand for this no longer!

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:11.600
Two people starving.
And meanwhile all this vulgar show!

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:19.066
Helen. Have you actually
brought two starving people...

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:23.362
- from London to Shropshire?
- There was a restaurant car on the train.

01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:26.573
Don't be absurd. I won't have
theatrical nonsense. How dare you?

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:29.409
Yes, how dare you! Bursting
into Evie's wedding in this way.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.788
My goodness. But you've
a perverted notion of philanthropy.

01:27:32.872 --> 01:27:35.791
Look at them.
They think it's some vulgar scandal...

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:39.211
and I must explain, "Oh, no.
It's only my sister screaming...

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:42.381
and only two hangers-on of ours whom she has
brought here for no conceivable reason."

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:45.550
We want to see Mr. Wilcox.

01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:51.556
Mr. Bast, this is an odd business.
What view do you take of it?

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:53.809
- There is Mrs. Bast too.
- Yes. How do you do?

01:27:53.893 --> 01:27:55.978
- How do you do?
- She's not well.

01:27:56.062 --> 01:27:58.730
- She fainted on the train.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.483
- Won't you sit down for a minute?
- I'm sure we don't wish to intrude.

01:28:01.567 --> 01:28:03.819
But you have been so kind
in the past, you and your sister.

01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:07.406
- My sister has put you in a false position, I'm afraid.
- Jacky. Let's go.

01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.408
Please. Helen. Offer them something.

01:28:09.492 --> 01:28:13.328
Mrs. Bast. Please.
Won't you have something to eat, please?

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:23.213
Now, Helen. I would like
to do something for them.

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:26.133
- Because I agree, we are in some way responsible.
- Via Mr. Wilcox.

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:30.721
Let me tell you once and for all. If you take up
that attitude, I'll do nothing. So choose.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:37.519
If you promise to take them
to the hotel quietly as my guests...

01:28:37.603 --> 01:28:40.272
then I will speak to Henry
about finding work for Mr. Bast.

01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:45.527
In my own way. Mind. There is to be
no more of this absurd screaming.

01:28:45.611 --> 01:28:49.239
- Well?
- All right. I promise.

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:51.825
Very well. Take them off
to the George. Then, and I'll try.

01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:53.827
But, Helen...

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.497
you have been
most self-indulgent.

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.875
You have less restraint,
rather than more. As you get older.

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:02.252
Think it over. Helen...

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:04.254
and alter yourself...

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:06.965
or we shan't have happy lives.

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:13.472
[Chattering]

01:29:13.556 --> 01:29:16.308
Let's eat some cake, shall we?

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:18.769
[Band]

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:27.778
[Helen] Mr. Wilcox has provided
all sorts of delicious things.

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:33.784
How about
some strawberries?

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.917
[Leonard]
Sorry. Excuse me.

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:44.836
- Now I must see to getting some rooms.
- No. We don't want to be any trouble.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.922
- We should come with you.
- Len —

01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:49.925
- Perhaps you'd like to stay.
- Look. There's all this pudding.

01:29:50.009 --> 01:29:53.720
- Mrs. Bast is extremely tired.
- I'm hungry.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.847
Perhaps you should
come back for her.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:58.934
- Will you be all right?
- I'll be all right.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:07.734
Ah.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:32.551
Charles. Charles. look!

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:38.056
- Whoever's that?
- [Charles] Where?
- Pink scarf.

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:53.155
Charles Wilcox.
How do you do?

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.490
Bride or groom?

01:30:59.912 --> 01:31:03.039
Very pleased to have
made your acquaintance.

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:07.752
Champagne, madam?

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:13.592
Helen? Here?

01:31:13.676 --> 01:31:18.346
But, uh. She refused the invitation.
I thought she despised weddings.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.473
- Where is she now?
- She's gone now.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:22.475
I've bundled her off
to the George.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.936
George Hotel?
You shouldn't have done that.

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:29.941
Well. She has two
of her proteges with her.

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:34.112
Ah, yes. Her proteges.
Well, let them all come.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:40.160
No. But, um. Later on...

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:42.537
I would like to talk
to you about them.

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:45.207
Well. Why not now?
No time like the present.

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:49.878
- Shall I?
- Mm, yes. If it isn't too long a story.

01:31:49.962 --> 01:31:52.505
- It's not five minutes.
- Yes.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:56.593
But there's a sting
at the end of it.

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:58.762
Hmm?

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:04.100
For I want you
to find the man some work in your office.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.311
[Laughing]

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:12.484
Well, what are
his qualifications?

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:16.112
- [Margaret] He's a clerk, I think.
- [Henry] Yes. Where was he before?

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.198
[Margaret]
Dempster's Bank.

01:32:18.282 --> 01:32:21.201
[Henry]
Dempster's. Why did he leave?

01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:24.579
- [Margaret] They reduced their staff.
- Oh.

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:30.543
Yes. Um, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:32.921
- [Margaret] Thankyou.
- Margaret.

01:32:33.005 --> 01:32:35.131
This cannot be taken
as a precedent, you know.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:38.551
I can't fit in your proteges
or Helen's proteges every day.

01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:42.305
- You do understand?
- Of course. Of course not.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:46.434
But he's —
he's rather a special case.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:50.146
Yes. Well. Proteges always are.
Aren't they, hmm?

01:32:52.358 --> 01:32:55.026
[Chattering]

01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:12.127
[Woman] Well, good-bye.
Thank you so much.

01:33:12.211 --> 01:33:15.964
- Good-bye.
- [Jacky] Why, if it isn't Henry.

01:33:16.048 --> 01:33:18.758
[Laughing]

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:24.264
Hello. Henry.
Fancy seeing you here.

01:33:24.348 --> 01:33:27.726
Uh. This is Mrs. Bast.
Sorry. She's a little overtired.

01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:31.187
- She's drunk.
- Don't you rememberJacky?

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.066
Henry, aren't you
gonna say hello?

01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:38.653
- Do you know — know Mrs. Bast?
- No, I don't!

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:40.822
[Jacky]
Know Henry?

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:42.824
- Who doesn't know Henry?
- Henry?

01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:46.328
- We've had some gay old times, haven't we. Hen?
- You're drunk.

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:48.455
[Margaret]
Henry?

01:33:49.832 --> 01:33:53.501
- Henry? Henry.
- Are you satisfied now. Margaret?

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:55.670
I can now understand
your keen interest in the Basts.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:58.256
I must say I congratulate you
on your little plan to trap me.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.258
- Trap you?
- I release you from your engagement.

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:02.886
Henry! Henry! Henry!

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:13.021
- Here we are.
- Oh. Please don't bother, my dear.

01:34:13.105 --> 01:34:15.231
I'm sure I can manage.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.567
[Henry]
That's all right. I'll do that. I'll do it.

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.778
Ah.

01:34:19.862 --> 01:34:22.739
- So that's it.
- That is what?

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.867
Thank you, dear chap.
You were saying?

01:34:25.951 --> 01:34:30.163
No. Henry and I were just having the fiercest
argument. But I think he has forgiven me.

01:34:30.247 --> 01:34:33.958
Oh, I don't expect
there's much to forgive.

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:37.253
Well, I really must be going.
Or we shall be late.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:39.422
Thank you so much
for a lovely time.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.716
And hasn't the weather
been kind to us?

01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:43.885
- Glorious.
- A lovely day.

01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:46.805
- Thank you. My dear. Very much.
- Safe journey.

01:34:46.889 --> 01:34:49.140
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Dolly. Bless you.
- Bye-bye, Albert.

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:51.184
- You take care of yourself.
- I shall.

01:34:51.268 --> 01:34:53.395
- Bye-bye.
- I've forgotten my hat.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:57.065
- It's here, Father.
- Oh. Ah. Thank you, Albert.

01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:59.150
Ah, are the womenfolk
all right then?

01:34:59.235 --> 01:35:02.320
- Yes.
- Shut the doors and we're all ready.

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:05.240
- Thank you. Uh, uh —
- [Engine Starts]

01:35:05.324 --> 01:35:07.492
Oh. Oh. Drive on then.

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:24.426
[Crying. Whimpering]

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.850
[Sobbing]

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:51.786
- What's the matter. Jacky?
- [Crying]

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:55.707
It was a shock, seeing him.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:36:00.670
- Him? Seeing who?
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:04.132
- [Staff Giggling]
- What do you think you're looking at?

01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:06.301
Len.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:19.564
Henry.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:24.903
Henry, look at me.

01:36:29.408 --> 01:36:32.535
So you were
that woman's lover.

01:36:33.579 --> 01:36:36.206
Since you put it
with your usual delicacy, yes. I was.

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.541
When?

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:41.127
- When, please?
- Ten years ago!

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.590
[Sighs]
I'm sorry. Ten years ago.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:55.600
Henry, dear,
it's not going to trouble us.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:06.528
Ah. Yes. We fellows all fall
from grace once in our time.

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.364
- Do you believe that. Margaret?
- Yes. I do believe it.

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:12.325
You with your refined pursuits
and your books.

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:14.786
What can you guess
of any man's life?

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.871
The temptations.

01:37:17.873 --> 01:37:19.874
Temptations.

01:37:20.876 --> 01:37:23.962
Well, that's enough.
I've spoken too much already.

01:37:24.046 --> 01:37:27.465
- Yes, that's enough, dear.
- [Clock Ticking]

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.677
It was in Cyprus.
It was very lonely.

01:37:30.761 --> 01:37:33.972
- You can never forgive me, can you?
- I have forgiven you. Henry.

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:38.268
Well, I, uh —

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.314
I could find an excuse.
But I won't.

01:37:44.775 --> 01:37:48.987
Let us speak no more
about it, dear. It is all behind us.

01:37:49.071 --> 01:37:54.033
Really? You can really bring yourself
to forgive me?

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:05.837
[Kissing] You've learned that
I'm far from a saint. In fact. The reverse.

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:08.089
- Shh.
- No, no. No, no. No.

01:38:08.173 --> 01:38:11.050
The reverse.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:14.387
- Where are those people now?
- Helen has taken them to the George.

01:38:14.471 --> 01:38:17.432
Oh. Then let them leave
first thing in the morning...

01:38:17.516 --> 01:38:20.560
because there must be no gossip
at the George.

01:38:20.644 --> 01:38:23.062
And anyway,
Helen should be here with us...

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:26.899
not stopping at a hotel
with some ragtags.

01:38:30.487 --> 01:38:33.281
Tell you what. Margaret. Why don't you
kindly write a note to that effect...

01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:37.535
and I'll have Burton send it out
to Helen straight away.

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:41.497
Burton!

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:45.793
- Burton!
- [Burton] Yes, sir.

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:49.505
I want you to take a note
over to the George Hotel straight away.

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:54.093
- Yes, sir.
- There's far too much noise out there.

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:02.644
[Margaret] I'm sorry to tellyou
that Henry can do nothing for Mr. Bast.

01:39:02.728 --> 01:39:05.146
He feels the Basts are not at all...

01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:07.899
the type we should trouble about.

01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:12.904
We found the woman drunk
on the lawn.

01:39:12.988 --> 01:39:15.531
Please see that they leave
first thing in the morning...

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.825
and come here yourself.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.453
He made her write it.
This isn't Margaret.

01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:23.289
Would you put it in the fire?

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.594
Better let us be, Miss Schlegel.
You don't want to get mixed up in this.

01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:40.056
Mixed up in what?

01:39:42.017 --> 01:39:46.229
What is it? You must
trust me that far. At least.

01:39:50.275 --> 01:39:55.613
Mr. Wilcox met Jacky before,
out in Cyprus. When she was 16.

01:39:58.409 --> 01:40:01.661
I told you you didn't want
to hear about it.

01:40:01.745 --> 01:40:05.289
Go on.
Why was she in Cyprus?

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:07.500
Her father was a clerk
in an export business.

01:40:07.584 --> 01:40:09.836
So after her mother died,
she'd gone out to be with him.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.380
Then he died.

01:40:12.464 --> 01:40:15.925
Accidentally drowned
because he couldn't swim.

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:19.053
Jacky was left having
to fend for herself...

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:21.806
till she managed
to get back home.

01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:59.677
I didn't have to marry her.
But I did.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.679
My family wouldn't
have anything to do with us.

01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:05.558
They tried to stop me.
But I married her all the same.

01:41:05.642 --> 01:41:09.353
Because I promised. If I hadn't.
Where would she be today...

01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:11.939
after the Mr. Wilcoxes
of this world had finished with her?

01:41:12.024 --> 01:41:14.859
It would never. Never.
Not in a thousand years...

01:41:14.943 --> 01:41:18.321
enter that man's mind
that he'd done anything wrong.

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:22.200
Because there's nothing here
and nothing here.

01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:25.912
And you're the opposite. You believe
in personal responsibility...

01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:27.914
and personal everything.

01:41:27.998 --> 01:41:32.168
Very nice. What good am I
to myself or to Jacky —

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:35.338
marrying her only to pull her down
with me so we can starve together?

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:37.965
You'll find another position.
Surely.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:39.967
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:43.930
If rich people fail at one profession.
They can try another.

01:41:44.014 --> 01:41:49.769
But with us, once a man over 20
loses his own particular job. He's done for.

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:55.399
I'd do anything in the world
to help you.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:01.113
Well, help me row then.
I'm tired.

01:42:21.927 --> 01:42:25.179
You're the one person
who ever has helped me.

01:42:25.264 --> 01:42:29.559
You mean by passing on false information
to make you give up your job?

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:33.062
I mean by being
the sort of person you are.

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:38.526
I didn't think people like you existed
except in books. And books aren't real.

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:40.903
Oh, no. They're more real
than anything.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:44.574
When people fail you,
there's still music and meaning.

01:42:46.618 --> 01:42:50.288
That's for rich people. To make them
feel good after their dinner.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.545
Everything's got spoiled
for you. Hasn't it?

01:43:30.829 --> 01:43:32.955
[Bells Chiming]

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:38.085
Don't know what's
to be done, Tibby.

01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:40.588
Or what to say to Meg.

01:43:40.672 --> 01:43:43.382
Don't want to face her
or even to go back to Wickham Place.

01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:48.512
You mean because of Mr. Wilcox
and the woman you say he seduced...

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:51.223
in between growing currants
in Cyprus?

01:43:53.518 --> 01:43:56.103
I want you to give Meg my love
and tell her —

01:43:56.188 --> 01:44:01.150
tell her I'm going away
to Germany... to Munich or else Bonn.

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:04.070
Such a message is easily given.

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:07.698
[Sighs] God. I wish I could escape
from Meg's wedding too.

01:44:07.783 --> 01:44:12.203
Is she going through with it? How
is it possible for our Meg to be a Wilcox?

01:44:12.287 --> 01:44:15.790
- And now, after all this?
- You'd much better go away to Germany.

01:44:15.874 --> 01:44:18.125
- [Knocking]
- There's Martlett with the Apple Charlotte.

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:20.878
Do you mind if I take it from him?
It spoils with waiting.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.383
Ah, Martlett.

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:29.470
- Shall I clear now?
- Not now. Um, later.

01:44:29.554 --> 01:44:32.264
Thank you very much.

01:44:34.559 --> 01:44:38.896
I feel — no, I know —
we owe the Basts some compensation.

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:41.816
- Those people again?
- Yes, those people again.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.027
Don't see who is to pay if I don't.
I'm placing what I consider...

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.029
is a minimum amount
to your account...

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:50.491
and when I'm in Germany.
You'll pay it to the Basts.

01:44:50.575 --> 01:44:53.828
I shall never forget your kindness.
Tibbikins. If you do this.

01:44:53.912 --> 01:44:56.622
- What's the sum?
- 5.000.

01:44:56.707 --> 01:45:00.167
- Good God!
- It's useless giving out driblets of charity...

01:45:00.252 --> 01:45:02.753
just shillings and blankets.

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:05.089
No doubt people
will think me mad.

01:45:05.173 --> 01:45:07.717
I don't give a damn
what people think...

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:12.346
but I do mind if you ruin yourself
for some quixotic reason of your own.

01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:14.724
I don't expect you
to understand me.

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:18.227
- I understand nobody.
- But you'll do it?

01:45:19.271 --> 01:45:21.397
Apparently.

01:45:32.951 --> 01:45:35.995
Are you writing to your brother?
He could send us another 10.

01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:37.997
Yes. And a long lecture
to go with it.

01:45:38.081 --> 01:45:41.042
- Your sister could afford a fiver.
- Leave me alone!

01:45:46.048 --> 01:45:49.050
Why are you taking it out on me?

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:52.344
You can see I'm busy.
Can't you?

01:46:02.981 --> 01:46:05.691
[Bells Chiming]

01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:10.780
[Leonard] Dear Mr. Schlegel,
I acknowledge receipt...

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:12.782
of your letter
dated second ofOctober...

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:15.576
enclosing a check
for £5,000.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.746
I am very grateful foryour concern,
but having no immediate necessity...

01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:21.582
I have the honor
to return your check herewith.

01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:25.586
Yours sincerely, Leonard Bast.

01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:28.172
[Low Chattering]

01:46:29.174 --> 01:46:32.802
[Leonard] Excuse me, sir.
Um, sorry to botheryou.

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:35.638
I worked in this office
for four years.

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.973
I was wondering if there were
any vacancies at the moment?

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.559
No. No, I'm sorry.
I've nothing.

01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:42.728
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at this time.

01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:45.189
Thank you for your time.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:35.573
[Henry] All right.
The servants will have the benefit...

01:47:35.657 --> 01:47:39.827
of the central heating if we
keep them here instead of at the back.

01:47:39.911 --> 01:47:43.998
- That's what the architect prefers.
- If only it would hurry up and get itself built.

01:47:44.082 --> 01:47:46.167
All in good time.

01:47:46.251 --> 01:47:48.377
- I'm getting tired of living in London.
- Are you?

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:51.005
- I can't be as young as I was.
- Yeah?

01:47:51.089 --> 01:47:55.634
I'm perfectly happy to do without all
the new plays and discussion societies and —

01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:59.096
Mr. Shaw. Mr. Wells
and all your utopias.

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:02.850
What I miss are trees
and mountains and meadows.

01:48:02.934 --> 01:48:04.852
Yes.

01:48:04.936 --> 01:48:09.607
- I also miss my own things.
- They're safe enough at Howards End.

01:48:09.691 --> 01:48:12.193
And of course I'm very grateful
to have them there.

01:48:12.277 --> 01:48:15.404
I would so like to see everything
in our own home.

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:20.367
My share at least. Goodness only knows
what Tibby intends to do with his.

01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:22.536
Or Helen.

01:48:24.372 --> 01:48:26.916
There's been another postcard
from her.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.377
Still the same poste restante address
in Bavaria.

01:48:30.462 --> 01:48:34.840
- But now she speaks of going to Italy.
- Is she never coming back to England?

01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:38.385
She's been away now —
How long has it been?

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:41.430
It will be four months
and three weeks on Tuesday.

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:43.891
Yes.

01:48:43.975 --> 01:48:46.644
Your sister is odd.
She always has been.

01:48:46.728 --> 01:48:49.104
There's no getting away from it.

01:48:50.315 --> 01:48:54.777
What is this?
What you been reading now?

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.737
- Theo —
- Theosophy.

01:48:56.821 --> 01:48:58.822
Oh, yes.
[Laughing]

01:49:00.158 --> 01:49:05.412
Madame Blavatsky.
Now. What a clever little woman it is.

01:49:05.497 --> 01:49:07.831
You see, that's
what I mean about Helen.

01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:10.417
She reads these things,
and her mind gets addled.

01:49:10.502 --> 01:49:14.672
My Margaret,
she keeps her facts straight.

01:49:14.756 --> 01:49:17.299
- What facts are those. Dear?
- Hmm?

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.593
About men and women
and all that sort of thing.

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:24.348
Who is who and what is what.
Yes. Now, what is that?

01:49:24.432 --> 01:49:27.643
Mr. Schlegel, sir,
you've forgotten these.

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.895
- Ah. Thank you, Martlett.
- Thank you. Sir.

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:42.324
Ah.

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:46.287
Oh. Dear. Annie.
Look. It's another one.

01:49:49.332 --> 01:49:51.750
And no letter.

01:50:00.343 --> 01:50:05.222
[Margaret] See, I just can't feel
that Helen's really alive.

01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:07.808
These postcards and telegrams
don't seem to have come from her.

01:50:07.892 --> 01:50:10.311
They're — That's not her.

01:50:10.395 --> 01:50:12.563
I know what you mean.

01:50:12.647 --> 01:50:14.815
You'll break that
if you keep fiddling with it.

01:50:14.899 --> 01:50:16.650
- [Margaret] Well, put it on.
- Oh!

01:50:16.735 --> 01:50:18.736
[Margaret]
Give me my card.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.991
[Helen] M.J. Schlegel, The Rise,
Straight Fleming, Devon.

01:50:24.075 --> 01:50:27.369
Dearest Meg,
arriving London Thursday.

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:30.581
Please telegraph, care my bank,
whetherAuntJuley is better...

01:50:30.665 --> 01:50:33.000
or likely to become worse.

01:50:33.084 --> 01:50:37.588
Give my love to the invalid
and keep some foryourselves. Helen.

01:50:37.672 --> 01:50:41.175
If only you had a companion
to take your walks with.

01:50:41.259 --> 01:50:44.303
I have Tibby. Dear Aunt Juley.

01:50:46.264 --> 01:50:49.016
And it won't be long —
Thank you, Maggie —

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.726
before you'll be up and about.

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:53.979
When is Helen coming?

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:57.649
Very soon. Dear. She will already
have reached London.

01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:08.494
[Whispering]
She's got to London all right.

01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:12.706
- Yes, but —
- She says to telegraph ifAunt Juley is better.

01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:16.251
Obviously, if you want to see her.
You must telegraph she's not better.

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:19.004
We can't start lying
to each other. Helen wouldn't —

01:51:19.089 --> 01:51:21.924
- Shh!
- She couldn't stay away at such a time.

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:30.849
[Margaret]
Dearest Helen, AuntJuley better...

01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:33.102
and eagerly expectingyou,
as am I.

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:35.187
Your Meg.

01:51:35.271 --> 01:51:37.189
[Helen]
Must return Germany at once.

01:51:37.273 --> 01:51:41.068
Telegraph to bank whereabouts
our books and furniture. Helen.

01:51:41.152 --> 01:51:44.029
Why did she have
to go back to Germany?

01:51:44.114 --> 01:51:46.782
I'll explain it all to you
after your nap.

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:49.868
She might have come to see her old aunt.
I haven't been well.

01:51:49.953 --> 01:51:53.414
Is cook doing the mackerel
the way Tibby likes them?

01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:57.292
I know his whole day is spoiled
if his breakfast isn't right.

01:51:57.377 --> 01:52:01.422
The mackerel were perfect. In fact. Tibby
particularly mentioned them this morning.

01:52:01.506 --> 01:52:04.091
Don't tell me. Tibby,
that it is still that business...

01:52:04.175 --> 01:52:06.635
over Henry and that woman.
Mrs. Bast.

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:11.515
Goodness me. How morbid.
His wife forgives him...

01:52:11.599 --> 01:52:15.394
and his sister-in-law cannot bear
to look upon his face.

01:52:15.478 --> 01:52:19.189
I don't believe it.
Not even of Helen.

01:52:19.274 --> 01:52:22.192
[Tibby]
We know to what extremes Helen goes.

01:52:22.277 --> 01:52:23.944
We've all suffered
under her temperament.

01:52:24.028 --> 01:52:29.450
But this is different. This is
not temperament, but a kind of madness —

01:52:29.534 --> 01:52:31.910
as if she were mad.

01:52:49.846 --> 01:52:53.807
Margaret. You've got black marks
again under your eyes.

01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:56.393
You know that's strictly forbidden.
Don't you?

01:52:56.478 --> 01:52:59.146
I'll not have my girl
looking as old as her husband.

01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:02.483
- You haven't quite seen our point.
- I don't suppose I ever shall.

01:53:02.567 --> 01:53:05.444
Our point is this:
Our sister may be mad.

01:53:07.822 --> 01:53:11.742
Oh, Charles, do come in.
We are again in trouble.

01:53:11.826 --> 01:53:15.829
- Can you help us at all?
- No, I'm afraid I cannot.

01:53:15.914 --> 01:53:19.333
What were the facts? We're all mad.
More or less. These days.

01:53:19.417 --> 01:53:23.587
The facts are that our sister has been
in England three days and won't see us.

01:53:23.671 --> 01:53:26.340
She's forbidden the bankers
to give us her address.

01:53:26.424 --> 01:53:30.719
She refuses to answer any questions.
All we have are these telegrams.

01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:34.765
And you want to get hold of her.
Is that it?

01:53:34.849 --> 01:53:38.936
- Well... yes.
- [Henry] Perfectly easy, Margaret.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.938
She wants her books, yes?

01:53:41.022 --> 01:53:45.108
Send her after them to Howards End.
When she's there. You just stroll in.

01:53:45.193 --> 01:53:47.152
If there's nothing wrong
with her, so much the better.

01:53:47.237 --> 01:53:50.155
But remember —
the motor will be around the corner.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.075
We quite simply run her
up to London to a specialist.

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:57.704
- That's impossible.
- Why is it impossible?

01:53:57.789 --> 01:54:00.040
Because Helen and I, we...

01:54:01.042 --> 01:54:03.877
don't speak that particular language...

01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:06.380
if you see my meaning.

01:54:06.464 --> 01:54:10.634
Yes. Because you have scruples.
And I understand perfectly.

01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:13.554
I'm as scrupulous
as any man alive, I hope.

01:54:13.638 --> 01:54:17.224
But when it is a case like this —
When it is a question of madness —

01:54:17.308 --> 01:54:20.185
- I deny it's madness.
- You said yourself.

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:22.437
It's madness when I say it.
But not when you say it.

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:27.526
Pater. You may as well
keep Howards End out of it.

01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:29.987
Why, Charles?

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:36.201
Well, the whole house is at sixes
and sevens. We don't want any more mess.

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:38.287
And who is "we"?

01:54:40.331 --> 01:54:44.918
- Pray, Charles. Who is "we"?
- Beg your pardon, I'm sure.

01:54:45.003 --> 01:54:48.005
Ah, I seem always
to be intruding.

01:54:49.173 --> 01:54:52.009
No. Charles. Charles!

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.761
[Door Opens And Closes]

01:54:54.846 --> 01:54:57.014
Let's send a telegram.

01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:00.684
Come along. Let's do it.

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:08.358
I can't have this sort
of behavior, Charles.

01:55:08.443 --> 01:55:10.861
- What?
- Margaret.

01:55:10.945 --> 01:55:15.532
She's far too sweet-natured
to mind, but I mind for her.

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:24.625
[Margaret]
Allyour books now at Howards End.

01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:27.336
Miss Avery will
let you in 3:00 p.m. Monday.

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.755
Meg.

01:55:29.839 --> 01:55:34.468
Our main object is not to
frighten Miss Schlegel, you understand?

01:55:34.552 --> 01:55:37.971
Trouble seems to be nervous.
Wouldn't you say so. Margaret?

01:55:38.056 --> 01:55:40.432
Would you say
she was normal?

01:55:40.516 --> 01:55:42.768
Well. She's always
been highly strung —

01:55:42.852 --> 01:55:46.313
musical. Literary, artistic —
but quite normal.

01:55:46.397 --> 01:55:48.607
Quite a charming girl. Really.

01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:51.276
Would you say
there was anything congenital?

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:53.570
- No, no.
- Or anything hereditary?

01:55:53.655 --> 01:55:54.863
No.

01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:15.967
- Margaret?
- Yes, Henry. Just wait here for a second.

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:21.890
Oh. My darling. Quickly —
Quickly just get inside please.

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:23.975
Just quickly.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:29.481
Miss Schlegel is managing.
You can go back to the motor. Margaret?

01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:33.944
Henry, I shall need your advice later.
But now I must be alone with Helen.

01:56:34.028 --> 01:56:36.613
- Certainly.
- Please, my dear, kind Henry.

01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:39.199
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:56:57.677 --> 01:57:01.847
- Where are all our furniture?
- Ah, there's been a mistake.

01:57:03.808 --> 01:57:06.226
How well the carpet fits.

01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:09.730
I'll be sending some milk round.
And we should be ordering coals.

01:57:09.814 --> 01:57:12.107
There's been a mistake.
Miss Avery. You've been very kind.

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:15.026
But we are not going to live
at Howards End. This is not our house.

01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:24.244
I think she may be
a little... touched.

01:57:25.455 --> 01:57:29.082
I'm sorry. Helen.
I ought not to have —

01:57:29.167 --> 01:57:31.835
No, you ought not
to have tricked me this way.

01:57:31.919 --> 01:57:34.796
- We thought you were ill.
- As you see, I'm not ill...

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:37.674
but I'm expecting a child in June.

01:57:37.759 --> 01:57:40.302
Is the coast clear?
I must leave.

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:42.637
I'm going back to Germany
in the morning.

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.639
Give my love to Aunt Juley
and to Tibby.

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:46.975
- Let me get that.
- Don't.

01:57:47.059 --> 01:57:49.770
It's curious, isn't it.
That our carpet fits?

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.607
Yes. The sword
looks right too.

01:57:54.609 --> 01:57:56.818
Yes. Doesn't it?

01:58:01.699 --> 01:58:05.202
- Someone's polished it.
- Yes.

01:58:07.038 --> 01:58:09.372
I'll carry this.

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:15.921
[Margaret] Even if you didn't want
to tell me, I understand that.

01:58:16.005 --> 01:58:20.258
I thought I had to be by myself.
That's why I hid away in Germany.

01:58:20.343 --> 01:58:22.636
- What about Tibby?
- You know, Meg. Really...

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:26.890
I alone must be responsible
for myself and this child.

01:58:26.974 --> 01:58:29.351
And I want to be.

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:31.394
Of course.
Leonard doesn't know.

01:58:31.479 --> 01:58:34.147
Leonard?

01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:37.943
- Leonard Bast?
- Yes.

01:58:38.027 --> 01:58:40.403
- [Gasps]
- Oh, Meg...

01:58:40.488 --> 01:58:43.907
did you ever hear
from him again?

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:49.996
[Sighs]
I have no idea what he's doing now...

01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:52.791
or what's happened
to either of them.

01:58:57.839 --> 01:58:59.798
[Henry]
Dolly.

01:58:59.882 --> 01:59:02.759
- Hello.
- [Dolly] Hello.

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:06.471
My dear. I must ask you.

01:59:06.556 --> 01:59:10.058
- Was your sister wearing a wedding ring?
- No.

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:12.060
- What?
- No.

01:59:13.062 --> 01:59:16.481
Henry, I really camejust
to ask a favor about Howards End.

01:59:16.566 --> 01:59:19.276
Yes. One point at a time.
Please. Sit down.

01:59:21.779 --> 01:59:24.030
Margaret...

01:59:24.115 --> 01:59:28.410
I must now ask you
the name of her seducer.

01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:31.580
You may have some inkling.
And the slightest hint would help us.

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:34.374
- "Us"? Who is "us"?
- Hmm?

01:59:34.458 --> 01:59:37.752
Well, I thought it best
to ring Charles.

01:59:37.837 --> 01:59:39.754
That was unnecessary.

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:42.173
My dear. Listen to me.

01:59:42.258 --> 01:59:45.927
Charles and I wish to act
in your sister's best interests.

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:48.889
It's still not too late
to clear her name.

01:59:48.973 --> 01:59:52.434
What are we —
to make her seducer marry her?

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.895
But Henry. Suppose he turned out
to be married already?

01:59:54.979 --> 01:59:57.939
- One has heard of such cases.
- Margaret.

02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:05.655
Then he must pay heavily
for his misconduct. Mustn't he?

02:00:07.283 --> 02:00:09.784
Now. Stay calm.

02:00:11.996 --> 02:00:14.164
I want to talk to you.

02:00:14.248 --> 02:00:16.833
Listen to me. Margaret.

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:19.836
Come here.

02:00:19.921 --> 02:00:21.922
Look at me.

02:00:22.006 --> 02:00:24.007
What's the matter?

02:00:26.594 --> 02:00:29.387
- Hmm?
- May I ask you my question now?

02:00:29.472 --> 02:00:32.766
- Certainly.
- Tomorrow Helen goes to Germany.

02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:34.768
- Yes.
- I'm fine.

02:00:34.852 --> 02:00:37.604
- Tonight. With your permission...
- Yes?

02:00:37.688 --> 02:00:40.106
She would like to sleep
at Howards End.

02:00:40.191 --> 02:00:42.359
Heav —

02:00:42.443 --> 02:00:44.903
But why at Howards End?
I don't understand.

02:00:44.987 --> 02:00:48.782
It is an odd request, but you know
what women in her state are.

02:00:48.866 --> 02:00:52.535
I could understand if it were
her own home — associations and so on.

02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:54.955
But Helen has no associations
with Howards End.

02:00:55.039 --> 02:00:58.291
I don't see why she wants to stay there.
She'll only catch cold anyway.

02:00:58.376 --> 02:01:02.170
- Call it fancy. But she wants to.
- I don't understand.

02:01:02.296 --> 02:01:05.215
- If she wants to sleep there one night.
She'll want to sleep there two.
- No, no. Just —

02:01:05.299 --> 02:01:07.550
- And she'll never get out of the house.
- That matters so very much?

02:01:07.635 --> 02:01:09.594
- Of course it would. It's Charles's —
- No, no.

02:01:09.679 --> 02:01:12.180
We will only trouble
Howards End for this one night.

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:15.058
- I shall stay with her —
- No. That's quite impossible.

02:01:15.142 --> 02:01:17.686
- I want you here to meet Charles.
- What has Charles to do with this?

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:20.939
As the future owner of Howards End.
It has everything to do with Charles.

02:01:21.065 --> 02:01:25.944
- In what way? Please answer me. Henry.
- [Henry] You're forgetting yourself.
There's Dolly and the servants.

02:01:26.028 --> 02:01:28.655
In what way? Would Helen's condition
depreciate the property?

02:01:28.739 --> 02:01:30.782
Margaret!

02:01:30.866 --> 02:01:33.785
[Baby Cooing]

02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:37.998
- [Panting]
- Margaret.

02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:43.586
I shall do what I can
for your sister...

02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:46.006
but I cannot treat it
as if nothing has happened.

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:48.383
I should be forced
from my position in society if I did.

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:52.887
Tomorrow she will go to Germany
and trouble society no longer.

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:58.643
Tonight, she asks to sleep
in your empty house.

02:01:58.728 --> 02:02:02.022
May she?
Will you give my sister leave?

02:02:02.106 --> 02:02:04.607
Will you forgive her...

02:02:06.193 --> 02:02:09.029
as you yourself
have been forgiven?

02:02:10.072 --> 02:02:13.283
- As I myself have been —
- Please answer my question. Henry.

02:02:15.202 --> 02:02:17.912
Your sister can sleep at the hotel.
I have my children...

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:20.999
and the memory
of my dear wife to consider.

02:02:21.083 --> 02:02:24.044
You have mentioned
Mrs. Wilcox.

02:02:24.128 --> 02:02:27.672
In reply,
may I mention Mrs. Bast?

02:02:29.925 --> 02:02:32.302
- You have not been yourself all day.
- Henry, listen.

02:02:32.386 --> 02:02:34.304
You have had a mistress.
I forgave you.

02:02:34.388 --> 02:02:37.974
My sister has a lover.
You drive her from the house!

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:40.852
Why can you not be honest
and say to yourself...

02:02:40.936 --> 02:02:44.189
"What Helen has done.
I have done"?

02:02:49.445 --> 02:02:51.863
I repeat what I said before.

02:02:51.947 --> 02:02:54.532
I do not give your sister leave
to sleep at Howards End.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:59.079
Now, do you understand?

02:03:06.337 --> 02:03:08.421
[Bells Chiming]

02:03:08.506 --> 02:03:12.258
[Charles] lfa man played about with
my sister, I'd send a bullet through him.

02:03:12.343 --> 02:03:16.971
But I suppose you're sunk too deep
in books and rubbish.

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:19.265
Do you mind what happens
to your sister?

02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:23.812
As a matter of fact, I mind very much
what happens to my sister.

02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:26.898
But I have a different way
of expressing it from yours.

02:03:26.982 --> 02:03:31.152
- Not to speak of different manners.
- By Jove. I'm glad of my way!

02:03:32.947 --> 02:03:36.199
I'm glad my father never sent me to
the varsity if this is what they teach you.

02:03:37.868 --> 02:03:42.330
Look. You must know something
of your sister's life.

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:46.376
- Do you know of anyone?
- No.

02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:49.170
Whom do you suspect?

02:03:51.006 --> 02:03:54.050
Did she mention anyone
by name?

02:03:54.135 --> 02:03:56.886
Come on. Yes or no.
You're hiding something. Man. Speak up.

02:03:56.971 --> 02:03:59.389
She did mention some friend
called Leonard Bast.

02:03:59.473 --> 02:04:01.683
Leonard Bast, eh?

02:04:02.685 --> 02:04:04.811
Leonard Bast.

02:04:04.895 --> 02:04:07.272
Do you know him?

02:04:07.356 --> 02:04:10.316
Have you had
any dealings with him?

02:04:10.401 --> 02:04:13.027
Oh, what a family.

02:04:13.112 --> 02:04:15.822
What a family!
God help the poor pater.

02:04:15.906 --> 02:04:18.116
I'd say God help my poor sisters.

- [Man] But they were ordered on approval.

02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:28.877
- [Woman] We do not accept things on approval.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:32.380
- [Woman] Wait.
- [Man] Ma'am.

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:34.883
Excuse me. I was looking
for Miss Schlegel.

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:37.594
- It's —
- Leonard Bast. I used to call at Wickham Place.

02:04:37.678 --> 02:04:40.221
Is Miss Schlegel in?
Or Mrs. Wilcox?

02:04:40.306 --> 02:04:44.517
- They're all down at Howards End.
- Where would that be now? Howards End?

02:04:44.602 --> 02:04:47.395
It's at Hilton,
near Hilton Junction.

02:04:49.106 --> 02:04:52.859
Are you all right?
Let me get you a drink ofwater.

02:04:52.943 --> 02:04:55.445
No. Thank you.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:01.326
- Please take them. Ma'am. This is —
- Come on. Off you go.

02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:10.043
I don't want you to conclude
that my wife and I...

02:05:10.127 --> 02:05:12.879
have had anything like a quarrel.

02:05:12.963 --> 02:05:15.506
She is overwrought,
as who would not be. Naturally.

02:05:15.591 --> 02:05:17.550
Naturally.

02:05:17.635 --> 02:05:20.720
The question in my mind
is connected to something far greater —

02:05:20.804 --> 02:05:22.847
the rights of property itself.

02:05:22.932 --> 02:05:27.560
- Absolutely.
- The house is mine and will be yours.

02:05:27.645 --> 02:05:30.939
When I say I don't want anyone living
at Howards End...

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:33.816
I mean no one
is to live at Howards End.

02:05:33.901 --> 02:05:36.569
Then I take it tomorrow morning
I may go up in the motor?

02:05:36.654 --> 02:05:38.613
Mm.

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:41.950
Yes. Say that you're acting
as my representative...

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:45.036
and that they must
clear out at once.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.122
You must go to bed now.
I've kept you up far too late.

02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:55.838
- Can I do anything for you, sir?
- H mm? No. Nothing.

02:05:55.923 --> 02:05:57.924
Thank you, my boy.

02:05:58.008 --> 02:06:00.677

- You're all dressed!
- I'm just going out for a bit.

02:07:18.505 --> 02:07:21.549
- What ho, Len.
- What ho, Jacky.

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:23.926
See you again later.

02:07:24.011 --> 02:07:27.180
[Train Passes, Whistle Blows]

02:07:42.571 --> 02:07:45.031
[Dogs Barking]

02:07:49.119 --> 02:07:51.954
[Wheels Rattling]

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:10.556
[Children Laughing, Chattering]

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:27.156
[Whistle Blows]

02:08:30.494 --> 02:08:34.497
- [Leonard] Excuse me. Howards End?
- U p the gate, turn left...

02:08:34.581 --> 02:08:37.333
and through the high street
and straight on through for a mile.

02:08:49.096 --> 02:08:52.306
[Horn Honking]

02:09:05.654 --> 02:09:08.364
[Helen]
Didyou see the dawn?

02:09:08.449 --> 02:09:10.491
- And was it wonderful?
- [Leonard] No.

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:13.619
- [Helen And Margaret Laughing]
- [Leonard] It was only gray.

02:09:31.889 --> 02:09:34.140
[Leonard] Excuse me. Could you
direct me to Howards End?

02:09:34.224 --> 02:09:37.226
[Boy]
This is Howards End.

02:09:46.904 --> 02:09:49.113
Yes. Thank you very much.
Charles.

02:09:49.198 --> 02:09:51.908
There are two boxes of books in the —

02:09:58.749 --> 02:10:02.919
Miss Schlegel — Mrs. Wilcox.
You'll have forgotten me.

02:10:03.003 --> 02:10:05.296
No. Mr. Bast,
I have not forgotten you.

02:10:07.424 --> 02:10:11.052
I only want to know
where your sister is, where Helen is.

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:14.764
- [Charles] Who is it?
- Helen?

02:10:14.848 --> 02:10:17.350
Leonard!

02:10:17.434 --> 02:10:19.560
So this is Leonard Bast.

02:10:21.772 --> 02:10:24.315
- This is for insulting the name of woman.
- [Margaret Screams] No!

02:10:24.399 --> 02:10:26.025
- Get me a stick. Margaret. A stick.
- Will you please stop?

02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:28.903
Charles. We are perfectly capable
of dealing with this.

02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:32.114
- No!
- Get back!

02:10:32.199 --> 02:10:34.825
- Stand up, man!
- [Women Screaming] Charles!

02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:36.953
- Stand up!
- Stop it. Charles!

02:10:58.392 --> 02:11:01.852
[Henry] So it is your opinion that he
was in the last stages of heart disease?

02:11:01.937 --> 02:11:05.231
It would not be professional
to say so before an autopsy...

02:11:05.315 --> 02:11:10.528
but in private.
That could well be my diagnosis.

02:11:10.612 --> 02:11:12.572
Obviously he was in the last stage...

02:11:12.656 --> 02:11:16.617
because the moment I touched him
with the sword, he simply crumpled up.

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:19.662
Excuse me. Sir.
What sword would that have been?

02:11:19.746 --> 02:11:24.000
U m, well. It's inside.
You'd better follow me.

02:11:33.343 --> 02:11:36.345
It's their father's
old German sword.

02:11:37.347 --> 02:11:40.224
Course. I only touched him
with the flat of it.

02:11:40.309 --> 02:11:44.812
- Just once?
- Yes, once, perhaps twice.

02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:50.901
I presume you will be staying
in Hilton, Mr. Wilcox. Sir?

02:11:50.986 --> 02:11:54.905
Ah, yes. Yes. I'll be available
as long as is necessary.

02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:59.285
And, Mr. Charles Wilcox.
We shall be requesting your presence...

02:11:59.369 --> 02:12:02.079
at the inquest, sir.

02:12:02.164 --> 02:12:06.709
Yes. Well. I did expect that. I shall
naturally be the most important witness.

02:12:47.125 --> 02:12:49.543
Margaret?

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:56.884
Good. Henry, I was going to come up
to Hilton to give you these.

02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:59.095
Yes. I have something
to tell you. Margaret.

02:12:59.179 --> 02:13:02.264
Never mind. Henry. I don't need
to hear it. I'm leaving you.

02:13:02.349 --> 02:13:05.685
- My life is with Helen now.
- Yes.

02:13:05.769 --> 02:13:10.940
I'm extremely tired.
Come and sit down for a moment.

02:13:12.567 --> 02:13:14.819
Yes. For a moment. We'll have
to sit here on the grass then.

02:13:14.903 --> 02:13:17.029
Yes.

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:26.664
Here are your keys. We shall be staying
with Miss Avery at the farm till we can leave.

02:13:26.748 --> 02:13:29.917
Yes. Where are you going?

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:32.044
To Germany.

02:13:32.129 --> 02:13:34.463
We'll start as soon as possible
after the inquest.

02:13:34.548 --> 02:13:37.925
- After the inquest.
- If Helen is well enough.

02:13:38.009 --> 02:13:41.554
You realize what
the verdict will be, don't you?

02:13:41.638 --> 02:13:44.557
Yes. Heart disease.

02:13:44.641 --> 02:13:48.686
No. Manslaughter.
If not worse.

02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:52.815
Charles may go to prison.
I dare not tell him.

02:13:52.899 --> 02:13:55.651
I don't know what to do.

02:13:57.738 --> 02:14:00.740
[Crying]
I don't know what to do.

02:14:02.242 --> 02:14:04.660
[Sniffling]

02:14:05.871 --> 02:14:08.456
I'm sorry.

02:15:42.551 --> 02:15:44.885
[Henry] Now, is this going
to suit everyone?

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.012
Because I don't want you all
coming here later on...

02:15:47.097 --> 02:15:49.265
and complaining
that I've been unfair.

02:15:49.349 --> 02:15:51.225
- Paul?
- Apparently, it's got to suit us.

02:15:51.309 --> 02:15:56.397
You've only to speak. My boy,
and I'll leave the house to you entirely.

02:15:56.481 --> 02:16:01.068
Since I have to be at the business all week.
I'll find something that suits me better.

02:16:01.152 --> 02:16:06.824
This place is not really the country.
And, well, it's certainly not the town.

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.578
Does my arrangement
suit you, Evie?

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:13.080
- Of course, Father.
- Good. You, Dolly?

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:17.001
I thought Charles wanted it
for the boys...

02:16:17.085 --> 02:16:20.004
but last time I saw him.
He said no...

02:16:20.088 --> 02:16:22.673
because we can't possibly live
in this part of England again.

02:16:23.758 --> 02:16:25.885
Charles even says
we ought to change our name...

02:16:25.969 --> 02:16:28.095
but I can't think what to.

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:30.890
Wilcox just suits Charles and me.

02:16:30.974 --> 02:16:33.976
I can't think of any other name.

02:16:35.061 --> 02:16:37.062
Yes.

02:16:38.147 --> 02:16:40.983
Then I leave Howards End
to my wife absolutely.

02:16:41.066 --> 02:16:43.818
Let everyone understand that.
And after I'm dead...

02:16:43.904 --> 02:16:47.239
let there be no jealousy
and no surprise.

02:16:47.324 --> 02:16:50.034
In consequence,
I leave my wife no money —

02:16:50.118 --> 02:16:54.120
that is her own wish — and all
my other assets are to be divided among you.

02:16:55.915 --> 02:17:00.169
This house, Howards End, she intends,
at her death, to leave to her nephew.

02:17:05.799 --> 02:17:09.011
- Whoop!
- [Baby Coos]

02:17:10.513 --> 02:17:14.099
It does seem curious. Mrs. Wilcox
wanted Margaret to have Howards —

02:17:14.183 --> 02:17:17.602
- Shh!
- And now she gets it after all.

02:17:17.687 --> 02:17:20.731
- Dolly.
- Did I put my foot in it?

02:17:28.698 --> 02:17:33.243
Hmm? Yeah. Yeah.

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:41.584
[Helen] Come on.
Let's get out of the way. Come on.

02:17:42.963 --> 02:17:45.172
Take baby's hand.

02:17:49.052 --> 02:17:51.887
Oh, look. What's over there?

02:17:53.223 --> 02:17:55.849
I wonder what it is.

02:17:55.933 --> 02:18:00.187
Oh, it's a sweet child. Rather
like didums was at that age.

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:02.647
Come along, Dolly.

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:06.402
- [Margaret] Safe journey.
- Good-bye.

02:18:06.486 --> 02:18:09.112
Trapped.

02:18:09.197 --> 02:18:12.156
Come on. It's time
away we came from the jungle.

02:18:12.242 --> 02:18:15.411
Look.
Look who's there. Look.

02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:22.166
What did Dolly mean
about Howards End?

02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:24.253
Hmm?

02:18:24.337 --> 02:18:27.630
My poor Ruth.
During her last days...

02:18:27.716 --> 02:18:30.759
scribbled your name
on a piece of paper.

02:18:30.843 --> 02:18:34.471
Knowing her not to be herself.
I set it aside.

02:18:35.598 --> 02:18:37.599
Didn't do wrong. Did I?

02:18:37.683 --> 02:18:39.809
- There. They're off.
- [Auto Passing]

02:18:39.894 --> 02:18:41.978
There they go. Bye.

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:45.441
Bye.
