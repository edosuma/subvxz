00:12.205 --> 00:15.284
Tonight,
I find a bicycle in a river...

00:15.285 --> 00:18.124
James annoys a dog...

00:18.125 --> 00:21.045
and Richard jumps over a dyke.

00:26.085 --> 00:28.284
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:28.285 --> 00:29.684
Hello!

00:29.685 --> 00:32.484
Hello, good evening!
Hello, everybody.

00:32.485 --> 00:34.644
Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:34.645 --> 00:36.204
Now...

00:36.205 --> 00:38.924
we start tonight on our track.

00:38.925 --> 00:44.044
This is a place of screaming
engines and tyre smoke.

00:44.045 --> 00:49.164
It is a cathedral to the god of
thunder and the mistress of power.

00:49.165 --> 00:51.805
The natural home, then,
for James May.

00:56.805 --> 01:00.685
That is a selection
of sporty Astons.

01:09.565 --> 01:16.205
All of them neatly demonstrating
exactly what's wrong with
modern sports cars - handling.

01:18.805 --> 01:24.644
The people who make sports cars are
absolutely obsessed with it, to
the exclusion of everything else,

01:24.645 --> 01:29.324
like comfort, refinement.
They just give you a racket,
a load of smoke and a bad back.

01:29.325 --> 01:31.924
ENGINE ROARS

01:31.925 --> 01:35.884
That is the noise made by idiots -
full of sound and fury

01:35.885 --> 01:37.485
and signifying nothing.

01:39.085 --> 01:43.044
The reason these Astons
are so unnecessarily hard core

01:43.045 --> 01:47.964
is this because of this place -
the Nurburgring.

01:47.965 --> 01:52.084
As soon as a car company comes here
to develop a new model,

01:52.085 --> 01:54.844
they forget about everything else
except lap times,

01:54.845 --> 01:59.005
and that is the ruination of a car.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.844
Of course, those of you who know
your Astons will be saying,

02:04.845 --> 02:10.644
"But there is a model for you -
the DB9, the most grown-up
and least sporty Aston of them all."

02:10.645 --> 02:16.004
The trouble with this, though, is,
it isn't shaking my teeth out

02:16.005 --> 02:19.724
and it's not sending me into
a boiling rage about handling,

02:19.725 --> 02:22.084
but it isn't really giving me
the fizz, either.

02:22.085 --> 02:25.764
I think this has now gone
a bit too far the other way.

02:25.765 --> 02:29.204
There's a slight
whiff of old fart about it.

02:29.205 --> 02:34.524
So, what I need is
the comfort of the DB9

02:34.525 --> 02:37.965
infused with some of the power
of the red-hot DBS.

02:39.045 --> 02:42.725
And it looks like my prayers
may have been answered...

02:43.925 --> 02:46.165
with this, the new Virage.

02:47.165 --> 02:51.204
At first glance, it looks the same
as any of the current Astons.

02:51.205 --> 02:56.644
But take a second look
and you'll see that nearly all
the body panels are new,

02:56.645 --> 03:01.324
as are the front grille
and the streamlined headlights.

03:01.325 --> 03:06.565
But does it fill the gap
between the DB9 and the DBS?

03:08.925 --> 03:13.844
Now, the DBS has 510 horsepower,

03:13.845 --> 03:21.484
the DB9 over there has 470,
and the Virage, that has 490.

03:21.485 --> 03:24.724
Logically, then, the Virage should
be the second fastest.

03:24.725 --> 03:27.444
I wonder how we can find that out.

03:27.445 --> 03:30.405
ENGINES ROAR

03:31.645 --> 03:36.644
Well, come on, we've got a runway
and three Astons.
What do you expect us to do?

03:36.645 --> 03:38.565
Go!

03:43.805 --> 03:45.725
Taking the DB9...

03:48.325 --> 03:51.285
Only just. It's very close.

03:52.685 --> 03:55.605
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

03:58.045 --> 03:59.444
Yes!

03:59.445 --> 04:02.764
The car in the middle
of the power range

04:02.765 --> 04:05.484
came in the middle of the race.
How about that?

04:05.485 --> 04:12.044
The Virage uses the same 6-litre V12
you'll find in the DB9 and the DBS,

04:12.045 --> 04:15.525
but, again, it's a sort of
in-the-middle version.

04:18.084 --> 04:21.245
It's tuned differently
from the DBS engine.

04:22.245 --> 04:25.964
Now it gives 85%
of maximum torque...

04:25.965 --> 04:29.204
it does 1,500 RPM...

04:29.205 --> 04:34.845
and it will go on
to 186 miles an hour!

04:36.165 --> 04:41.124
And when all this gets a bit much,
you have ceramic brakes as standard.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.564
So...

04:42.565 --> 04:44.445
Phwoar.

04:45.525 --> 04:47.565
Nice.

04:49.085 --> 04:53.844
As for the handling - surprise,
surprise - it's sharper than the DB9

04:53.845 --> 04:57.404
but not as aggressive as a DBS.

04:57.405 --> 05:00.564
So let's move on to the price.

05:00.565 --> 05:02.924
The DBS is £170,000.

05:02.925 --> 05:06.724
The DB9 is £125,000.

05:06.725 --> 05:11.925
The new Virage is £150,000.
You see - in the middle.

05:14.365 --> 05:18.964
So far, then, it's shaping up well,
and it gets better.

05:18.965 --> 05:21.804
This is probably the
best-looking of all the Astons

05:21.805 --> 05:24.444
and it has the nicest interior.

05:24.445 --> 05:28.525
The stitching is all done
by one seamstress
to keep the weave constant.

05:29.805 --> 05:34.644
And, joy of joys, the useless Volvo
sat nav of other Astons

05:34.645 --> 05:36.964
has been ditched for one that works.

05:36.965 --> 05:40.604
However, before I can give this car
a clean bill of health,

05:40.605 --> 05:44.924
I have to address
the elephant in the room.

05:44.925 --> 05:49.004
The worry is, they've made another
track monster.

05:49.005 --> 05:53.204
They've fallen for the same
old trick - it's got to go
round the Nurburgring, etc, etc.

05:53.205 --> 05:56.364
So I've decided to
do something radical...

05:56.365 --> 06:01.244
leave the track and go for
a potter round our airfield.

06:01.245 --> 06:08.324
My idea here is to go on something
a bit like a real road and
see what the ride is actually like,

06:08.325 --> 06:14.964
and it will allow me to show you all
the bits of the Top Gear test track
that you never normally see.

06:14.965 --> 06:18.084
That's actually our studio.
This is Nigel's garage.

06:18.085 --> 06:20.124
He's a lovely chap.

06:20.125 --> 06:24.204
Unfortunately, viewers, I then
had to cancel the rest of the tour

06:24.205 --> 06:28.324
because, after just a few hundred
yards, I was too cross to carry on.

06:28.325 --> 06:31.604
My God, I don't believe it.
They've done it.

06:31.605 --> 06:37.604
I've got everything turned off, I've
got sport off, the firm suspension
off, but it's still too jiggly.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.604
HE SIGHS

06:39.605 --> 06:42.964
It's been ruined by the ride.
Listen.

06:42.965 --> 06:47.005
Rattle, rattle, bang, bang.
That is not necessary.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.404
The Virage, then,
is a missed opportunity.

06:53.405 --> 06:57.724
It could, and should, have been
a comfortable gentleman's express.

06:57.725 --> 07:02.365
Instead, it's just another pointless
bone-shaking racing car.

07:15.885 --> 07:18.885
What? Right!

07:20.005 --> 07:24.204
Is this going to be a
five-minute argument,
or do you want the full half-hour?

07:24.205 --> 07:27.164
No, cos I actually agree with you.
No... Oh, for God's sake!

07:27.165 --> 07:31.844
Look, the point is, Aston already
make the DBS and the Vantage S

07:31.845 --> 07:34.284
for enthusiasts of the Nurburgring,

07:34.285 --> 07:37.444
but there might be somebody who
wants a faster Aston

07:37.445 --> 07:41.964
but maybe has, I don't know,
backache, for example!
Yes, I agree with that.

07:41.965 --> 07:46.484
Oh, shut up, man! Do you not realise
this could have been that car,

07:46.485 --> 07:49.244
and it isn't,
and that's a tragedy? I know.

07:49.245 --> 07:52.084
You are such an idiot! Honestly!

07:52.085 --> 07:56.004
Anyway, we must now find out
how fast it goes round our track.

07:56.005 --> 07:57.164
Why?!

07:57.165 --> 07:59.244
LAUGHTER

07:59.245 --> 08:04.844
Because that enables me to
say some ludicrous things about
our tame racing driver.

08:04.845 --> 08:09.804
Some say that he can't eat mashed
potato for religious reasons...

08:09.805 --> 08:11.724
LAUGHTER

08:11.725 --> 08:16.564
and that he recently received
47,000 tickets, Olympic tickets,

08:16.565 --> 08:20.725
all of them for the final
of the women's wrestling.

08:22.485 --> 08:24.405
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

08:24.406 --> 08:26.524
And he's off.

08:26.525 --> 08:29.525
A nice controlled start there.
And listen to that V12.

08:31.525 --> 08:34.484
OK, coming up to the first corner.

08:34.485 --> 08:38.044
It's a heavy car, this, but it
manages to corner surprisingly flat.

08:41.164 --> 08:44.005
MUSIC PLAYS

08:45.525 --> 08:48.764
Stig listening to the Bangles
there, but in German.

08:48.765 --> 08:50.124
Very off.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.124
One lot of tyre smoke
coming out of Chicago.

08:53.125 --> 08:57.964
Coming up to Hammerhead.
Will the big engine upfront
drag the nose wide?

08:57.965 --> 09:00.324
No, it is clinging on,

09:00.325 --> 09:04.804
and it is in fact... Yep! It's
the back that's letting go first.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.645
Very neat on the way out, though.

09:10.605 --> 09:14.164
OK, into Follow Through.
Really opening up the taps now.

09:14.165 --> 09:15.804
You can hear him shift up.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.804
Lifting it, actually,
into the approach to the tyres.

09:18.805 --> 09:22.484
That is impressive.
Just two corners left now.

09:22.485 --> 09:25.604
Hard on those ceramic brakes.
Fat Pirelli squealing.

09:25.605 --> 09:28.004
Just Gambon left.

09:28.005 --> 09:31.084
Sliding it through there
and across the line!

09:31.085 --> 09:33.565
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:35.885 --> 09:41.764
He did it... He did it in 1.24.4,

09:41.765 --> 09:46.364
so it's only half a second slower
than the DBS. Yeah.

09:46.365 --> 09:50.524
And it would've been
a much better car if it had been
five seconds slower. I agree.

09:50.525 --> 09:52.724
Ah, you're insufferable!

09:52.725 --> 09:54.685
LAUGHTER

09:56.845 --> 10:02.484
And now we must do the news,
and we start off with news
that since James drove that Virage,

10:02.485 --> 10:06.084
Aston Martin have launched
a new car, and here it is.

10:06.085 --> 10:08.804
It's called the V12 Zagato.
There it is.

10:08.805 --> 10:12.204
James will be particularly
interested in this, I think. Will I?

10:12.205 --> 10:17.364
You will. Because the boss
of the company was quoted this week

10:17.365 --> 10:20.924
as saying, "The Nurburgring is
where we sign off every new model

10:20.925 --> 10:26.244
"and there could be NO better place
for the new V12 Zagato
to be finally tested,"

10:26.245 --> 10:29.924
said the BOSS of Aston Martin.
For crying out loud!

10:29.925 --> 10:32.644
If I'd been in Bomber Command
in 1943,

10:32.645 --> 10:37.324
I would have bombed the Nurburgring
every night until it was gone!

10:37.325 --> 10:42.404
Am I the only person who thinks
like this? This bad back of yours -
does it make you a bit crabby?

10:42.405 --> 10:47.644
It's nothing to do with my bad back.
He's got a bad back as well,
but he won't agree... OK! OK!

10:47.645 --> 10:51.884
Ride is important.
All right, all right! Bomb it!

10:51.885 --> 10:56.364
It was a bad policy.
Look where we are now.
We no longer have Dresden Cathedral

10:56.365 --> 10:59.404
or all that lovely pottery,
but we do have the Nurburgring,

10:59.405 --> 11:02.284
and under my bombing policy, we
wouldn't have cars that rode badly

11:02.285 --> 11:05.725
and you'd have a nice cathedral
to look at, and better saucers!

11:06.565 --> 11:10.924
Now, have you noticed how
some of the best-looking cars
you can buy these days

11:10.925 --> 11:15.964
are, like, ordinary family saloons
or hatchbacks or estates?
I know what you mean. Yeah.

11:15.965 --> 11:18.604
Citroen have sent us
a picture of their new DS5.

11:18.605 --> 11:21.164
That is a good-looking
ordinary, mid-size car.

11:21.165 --> 11:26.364
It's not alone. What's that Kia
called, from a while back?
The Rooney. Not the Rooney.

11:26.365 --> 11:27.804
Rio. Rio.

11:27.805 --> 11:30.564
That was an awful-looking car,
but they've launched this,

11:30.565 --> 11:34.004
which is called the
something-or-other. The Optic.

11:34.005 --> 11:39.444
Optical... Optima. Doesn't matter.
Nobody who watches Top Gear is going
to buy a Kia, but if they did...

11:39.445 --> 11:42.364
All Kia drivers are watching
Countryfile going,

11:42.365 --> 11:48.204
"It's Adam's farm in a minute.
We're looking forward to that.
Oh, look at the little baa-lamb."

11:48.205 --> 11:52.284
Make a trail for what's
on the other side!
Countryfile's a brilliant show.

11:52.285 --> 11:56.964
Particularly when it's cold, and
Julie Bradbury's out in a T-shirt.
Leave it! Leave it!

11:56.965 --> 12:00.204
The Peugeot 508 is a good-looking
car. It is. We've got a picture.

12:00.205 --> 12:06.524
What makes that particularly good is
that Peugeots in recent years have
had the big guppy mouths on them.

12:06.525 --> 12:10.924
Yes, that. That is a very good
impersonation of a Peugeot.

12:10.925 --> 12:12.284
HE MUMBLES

12:12.285 --> 12:14.445
I can only impersonate a Morgan.

12:17.685 --> 12:19.165
Can you do any other car?

12:19.166 --> 12:22.404
No, I can only do Peugeots, but I
can do any Peugeot you name. 308.

12:22.405 --> 12:26.404
207. What's the people-carrier?
Can you do that one?

12:26.405 --> 12:28.765
Yeah, hang on, that's...

12:30.045 --> 12:31.364
I'll stump him.

12:31.365 --> 12:34.804
You know the tiny one, the 1007
with electric sliding doors?

12:34.805 --> 12:40.404
Ah... ahh... ahh...
It's exactly like that.

12:40.405 --> 12:45.124
And the Vauxhall Insignia.
I was following one the other day.
That's basically a Vectra.

12:45.125 --> 12:50.644
Yeah, fabulous. And the great thing
is, it's got positive camber
on its back wheels.

12:50.645 --> 12:54.244
You've got positive camber
and you look ridiculous. He's right.

12:54.245 --> 12:55.965
You have, you have.
We've followed you round
every airport in the world

12:55.966 --> 13:03.844
and you lumber along
with your stupid legs
bending out at the knee, like that.

13:03.845 --> 13:07.004
And it's like positive camber,
and you look TERRIBLE.

13:07.005 --> 13:13.364
It looks good, positive camber.
You look like a knackered Spitfire.
Yeah. Spitfires are cool.

13:13.365 --> 13:17.124
No, a leaky Triumph Spitfire.
That's assuming that's
oil that's leaking out of you.

13:17.125 --> 13:21.204
It's cos I'm set up for angling.
You're set up for?!

13:21.205 --> 13:23.645
If you could find a 100-metre track
that did that,

13:23.646 --> 13:26.764
I could beat Usain Bolt,
cos I could run round corners.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.604
You've been set up for cornering?

13:28.605 --> 13:34.724
You can shut up. You look like a
car that's had its wheels nicked.
Well... Now, last week,

13:34.725 --> 13:38.564
we looked at a modern-day
interpretation of the E-Type,
which was fantastic.

13:38.565 --> 13:41.164
Well, now there's another one.
Here it is.

13:41.165 --> 13:44.164
I just think that looks
spectacularly good.

13:44.165 --> 13:47.364
It starts out in life as
a Jaguar XK, our modern-day car,

13:47.365 --> 13:51.884
and then a Swiss company
ups the V8 engine by 100 horsepower

13:51.885 --> 13:57.244
and then they fit a - I have
to say - brilliant-looking
carbon fibre and aluminium body,

13:57.245 --> 14:00.244
so it's 200 kilograms lighter.
That's gorgeous. I know.

14:00.245 --> 14:03.484
I'm not sure I really like it.
That's cos you're odd.

14:03.485 --> 14:09.204
But... but I think there is
a problem with this car...

14:09.205 --> 14:12.164
because they've called it
the Growler.

14:12.165 --> 14:13.924
LAUGHTER

14:13.925 --> 14:15.164
Yeah.

14:15.165 --> 14:21.205
Now... now, we... we...
we Googled "growler"...

14:23.605 --> 14:26.484
and we were quite surprised
and a bit shocked

14:26.485 --> 14:28.444
by what it turns out to mean.

14:28.445 --> 14:32.124
And do you know, Richard,
I've forgotten what it is.
What does it mean?

14:32.125 --> 14:34.564
Can you tell
the ladies and gentlemen?

14:34.565 --> 14:39.684
Well, you know those big welcome mats
you might see on a girl in the '70s?

14:39.685 --> 14:41.285
That's what it is!

14:43.165 --> 14:47.764
Yeah. Why would you name your car
after THAT? Honestly,
James, I don't think they knew.

14:47.765 --> 14:50.564
I think they're sitting in Zurich,
or wherever...

14:50.565 --> 14:55.204
This is the first time
they've realised that "growler"
means THAT in England.

14:55.205 --> 14:57.924
And they'll be sitting going,
"Gott in Himmel!

14:57.925 --> 15:03.045
"Ve have accidentally named
ze car after ein Fraugarten!"

15:05.605 --> 15:07.165
The car, the Growler...

15:08.525 --> 15:12.084
is it based on an XK?
Has it got four seats?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.644
No, you can't get in the back.

15:13.645 --> 15:16.525
RICHARD GIGGLES

15:20.365 --> 15:22.204
What? What?!

15:22.205 --> 15:24.924
Everybody's turned over
to Countryfile.

15:24.925 --> 15:29.364
I'm not... I'm not sure they're
going to sell very many of those.

15:29.365 --> 15:31.964
No, neither do I.
There's another reason why.

15:31.965 --> 15:36.084
It costs £670,000. Ouch!

15:36.085 --> 15:39.924
There probably will be
a trimmed-down version later,
but I bet you...

15:39.925 --> 15:42.284
just for the Brazilian market.

15:42.285 --> 15:43.684
I'm sorry.

15:43.685 --> 15:46.284
It's called a Growler.

15:46.285 --> 15:51.045
There's a bloke at some point
going to say, "I'm just going
outside to wax the Growler."

15:55.845 --> 15:57.565
Oh, you dirty bugger!

16:02.245 --> 16:04.244
Anyway, that is the end of the news.

16:04.245 --> 16:07.804
Yes. Now, on Top Gear,
we love hot hatchbacks.

16:07.805 --> 16:13.324
The idea of a sporty car and a
practical car all rolled into one
easy-to-park box is hugely appealing.

16:13.325 --> 16:17.604
Yes, it is, but while we all agree
that hot hatchbacks are brilliant,

16:17.605 --> 16:20.404
we cannot agree on
which one is best.

16:20.405 --> 16:24.484
So the producers decided
we should sort this out on
a European road trip,

16:24.485 --> 16:29.164
beginning in the Italian town
of Lucca, which is in Italy.

16:29.165 --> 16:32.045
WOMAN SINGS ARIA IN ITALIAN

16:39.285 --> 16:45.485
I was the first to arrive and, as
you can see, my choice was superb.

16:46.685 --> 16:53.004
This is the Citroen DS3 Racing,
and it does
everything a hot hatchback should.

16:53.005 --> 16:59.364
It is bonkers to look at and, with
204 horsepower under the bonnet,
is bonkers to drive as well.

16:59.365 --> 17:03.684
But it still has back seats
that fold down. It's still small.

17:03.685 --> 17:06.364
It's still relatively inexpensive.
It's...

17:06.365 --> 17:11.845
Ah, it seems Mr May has arrived in
a driving instructor's car!

17:13.885 --> 17:19.365
This is a Renault Clio,
but it's the Cup version.

17:23.204 --> 17:27.844
And it is, pound for pound,
the most exciting car on sale.

17:27.845 --> 17:32.884
Not my words. Not my words.
The words of Autocar magazine.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.404
Autocar? Yes.
The magazine that sacked you?

17:35.405 --> 17:36.724
Yes.

17:36.725 --> 17:41.244
And I could point out that it's
£16,000 and yours is, what, 23?

17:41.245 --> 17:46.324
Where's your air-con,
cruise control, sat nav? You haven't
got anything. It's got air-con.

17:46.325 --> 17:51.324
It's an optional extra. It's
an option that's been selected.
What have you got, 197 horsepower?

17:51.325 --> 17:53.004
Yeah. 204.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.444
That's very nearly
as much power as yours.

17:55.445 --> 18:00.604
In the same way that the Egyptian
army is very nearly as
powerful as the American army.

18:00.605 --> 18:04.045
197... 'Mercifully, at this point,
Hammond arrived...

18:05.685 --> 18:08.604
'in a car from the 1950s.'

18:08.605 --> 18:14.884
Ha-ha! Gentlemen, behold
the Fiat 500 Abarth convertible.

18:14.885 --> 18:19.604
Best hot hatch ever. Well,
apart from a couple of things.
One is, it's not very hot,

18:19.605 --> 18:25.524
and two, it's not a hatchback. It
is hot. This has got the SS kit on.

18:25.525 --> 18:28.004
It says 158 brake horsepower
in there. Wow!

18:28.005 --> 18:30.764
Just a couple of things. Small.

18:30.765 --> 18:35.084
Yes, it is. This is enormous.
This is the Clio. Cup. Yes.

18:35.085 --> 18:39.004
You've brought one of those
ridiculously gaudy training shoes

18:39.005 --> 18:42.284
with springs at the back that go,
"Look at me, robot shoe."

18:42.285 --> 18:47.684
Look at it. This would look
good on the deck of
a Nimitz-class aircraft-carrier.

18:47.685 --> 18:51.884
We're not on the deck
of a Nimitz-class...

18:51.885 --> 18:57.324
We're in a beautiful Italian plaza.
You know what this is? What?
Juvenile.

18:57.325 --> 19:02.604
Juvenile? James, one thing...
This is just a small French car.

19:02.605 --> 19:06.764
It also has an optional extra
on it. It has air conditioning, yes.

19:06.765 --> 19:08.924
Yes, it has something else.
Ah, yes...

19:08.925 --> 19:13.604
But I didn't... What this actually
means in Italian is "bell end".

19:13.605 --> 19:17.284
James, just a headline
to sum up the cars.

19:17.285 --> 19:20.844
Magnificent, ridiculous...
It's a bit boring, bland.

19:20.845 --> 19:26.044
It might look boring...
It isn't boring because...
What are these cars about?

19:26.045 --> 19:30.844
They are about the sensation of
driving, and this will give it to me
because it's a small Renault

19:30.845 --> 19:36.004
and they're the best in the world at
that. It's about fun and experience.
It looks magnificent. Looks?!

19:36.005 --> 19:39.404
You can put the roof back...
But it isn't a hatchback.

19:39.405 --> 19:43.644
It's like turning up to do the
Grand National on a cow or a hen.

19:43.645 --> 19:45.324
It's not!

19:45.325 --> 19:50.644
'Seeing that this was going nowhere,
the producer stepped in
with a challenge.'

19:50.645 --> 19:53.564
This is a no-brainer.
A man with a thing...

19:53.565 --> 19:57.484
"To see which of your cars works
best in the urban environment,

19:57.485 --> 20:00.005
"you will now
leave the city of Lucca."

20:02.605 --> 20:04.964
Is that it?

20:04.965 --> 20:06.284
Yep.

20:06.285 --> 20:10.765
What, just drive out of a town?
How hard can that be?

20:12.965 --> 20:15.164
As it turned out, very hard,

20:15.165 --> 20:21.044
because in this medieval
walled city,
the streets were complete maze.

20:21.045 --> 20:25.885
Now, I think a left here.
Oh, I can't go down there.

20:27.245 --> 20:28.405
I can't go left.

20:28.406 --> 20:31.564
Right, but it doesn't
matter too much.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.644
I'll just go along here
and then turn right.

20:33.645 --> 20:37.164
Ah, no, there isn't a right.
It's just somebody's drive.

20:37.165 --> 20:38.765
I HAVE to go left.

20:39.885 --> 20:42.764
One way. Really?! You don't say!

20:42.765 --> 20:45.245
JEREMY LAUGHS

20:46.165 --> 20:51.684
Every single turn you make puts you
in exactly the same road
as the one you've just left.

20:51.685 --> 20:57.604
Also, in any other city, the Renault
and the Citroen
would be considered quite small.

20:57.605 --> 20:59.484
Cock.

20:59.485 --> 21:02.164
But here, they were huge.

21:02.165 --> 21:06.044
And... breathe in...

21:06.045 --> 21:07.844
Bloody hell.

21:07.845 --> 21:10.324
That's a squeeze.

21:10.325 --> 21:14.444
No, it's not going to fit. Sorry.

21:14.445 --> 21:20.084
Since when did the Renault Clio
become an enormous car
with a huge turning circle?

21:20.085 --> 21:23.924
Happily, the Fiat was small enough,
but I had another problem.

21:23.925 --> 21:26.284
This just isn't working.

21:26.285 --> 21:31.564
The visibility in the
C version with the sliding roof,

21:31.565 --> 21:35.684
with the roof back, is, you know,
it's good compared to, say,

21:35.685 --> 21:38.244
having a bag on your head
or being blind.

21:38.245 --> 21:43.204
Eventually, I decided the best thing
was to abandon ship.

21:43.205 --> 21:47.764
Right, I'm leaving the car here.
I'm going to go ahead on foot.

21:47.765 --> 21:52.364
I know I can make it on foot,
find the way out, come back,
pick up the car, drive out and win.

21:52.365 --> 21:56.884
This... this must be James's
idea of hell.

21:56.885 --> 21:59.404
He gets lost in a hotel.

21:59.405 --> 22:03.044
That was a curve in that road
which was essentially a right,

22:03.045 --> 22:06.365
but now I've gone to a left, so I
must still be going the right way.

22:08.205 --> 22:10.005
Driving through
somebody's restaurant.

22:10.006 --> 22:12.525
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

22:16.645 --> 22:19.404
Hang on a minute...

22:19.405 --> 22:23.484
Is this...
Is this the square where I started?

22:23.485 --> 22:25.684
Yes, it is.

22:25.685 --> 22:28.404
Hang on.

22:28.405 --> 22:30.884
That... That's the wall.

22:30.885 --> 22:33.204
That's the city wall.

22:33.205 --> 22:36.165
I've found it! There it is!

22:37.845 --> 22:41.484
A bit of a hill.
Wasn't expecting that. Never mind.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.845
Er...

22:47.245 --> 22:49.284
No, it's that way.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.964
Gearbox works.

22:50.965 --> 22:53.964
Reverse, first, both good.

22:53.965 --> 22:56.004
Meanwhile...

22:56.005 --> 22:59.044
I think that ramp may have
been a bit of a mistake,

22:59.045 --> 23:04.284
because the view from here and the
view over that way of trees

23:04.285 --> 23:08.165
suggests I am actually
on top of the wall.
Still, could be worse.

23:12.245 --> 23:13.924
Hi.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.404
I recognise you! Yeah!

23:16.405 --> 23:22.445
Have you seen a Fiat,
a small black and white Fiat...
on your travels?

23:27.245 --> 23:28.924
Nothing to see here.

23:28.925 --> 23:33.684
Just a man driving
on top of a historic monument.

23:33.685 --> 23:39.005
Eventually, I found my car
and the way back to the city wall.

23:40.285 --> 23:46.044
That's the first time since I left
that I've gone fast enough
to activate the central locking.

23:46.045 --> 23:50.565
But outside the city gates,
Professor Smug was already there.

23:51.405 --> 23:53.924
Yes, there's no missing it, is there?

23:53.925 --> 23:56.804
A man standing next
to a child's training shoe.

23:56.805 --> 23:58.884
Did you see Lord Lucan?

23:58.885 --> 24:01.084
No. Oh, he's there. Shergar.

24:01.085 --> 24:02.844
They're all in there.

24:02.845 --> 24:07.604
'Even though James wasn't with us,
another challenge then turned up.'

24:07.605 --> 24:09.844
RICHARD CLEARS HIS THROAT
Right.

24:09.845 --> 24:13.524
"You will now drive
to the town of Canelli,

24:13.525 --> 24:16.764
"which is 170 miles away, near Alba.

24:16.765 --> 24:21.164
"En route, you must collect
the following items.

24:21.165 --> 24:27.444
"A branch of a cedar tree, ice-cubes,
a photo of as many people
as you can getting into your car,

24:27.445 --> 24:33.924
"a CD from a service station -
but you may not get
out of your car to get it...

24:33.925 --> 24:36.844
"a bicycle, a vine and a dog."

24:36.845 --> 24:39.324
A dog?!

24:39.325 --> 24:40.924
A vine? A bicycle?

24:40.925 --> 24:45.244
Whereabouts on the Riviera
are you going to find...?
And a branch of a cedar tree...

24:45.245 --> 24:47.564
Oi! May!

24:47.565 --> 24:49.244
Yeah?

24:49.245 --> 24:53.164
What are you doing up there?
I can't find the way down.

24:53.165 --> 24:57.964
After the idiot explained
his predicament, we filled him in
on our new challenge.

24:57.965 --> 25:00.084
Dog?!

25:00.085 --> 25:02.964
That's what I said, "A dog"!
What's the point of that?

25:02.965 --> 25:05.484
It's to see how
practical the car is.

25:05.485 --> 25:07.044
Well, off you go, then.

25:07.045 --> 25:09.245
So we did.

25:12.885 --> 25:16.125
Autostrada, here we go.

25:18.365 --> 25:22.565
And as we headed north, we fell
even more in love with our cars.

25:24.965 --> 25:29.284
If you have a big BMW or Mercedes,
it's like an expensive suit,

25:29.285 --> 25:33.684
so it has to be a sober colour -
silver, black, grey.

25:33.685 --> 25:36.924
But if you have a hot hatch,
it's like a T-shirt.

25:36.925 --> 25:42.484
It can be anything you want -
have writing on it,
it can be orange, anything.

25:42.485 --> 25:45.804
That's why the DS3 Racing
is so brilliant,

25:45.805 --> 25:49.525
cos they've just taken the
idea of fun and gone mad with it.

25:51.565 --> 25:54.564
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Fizzy little car.

25:54.565 --> 25:56.724
RICHARD CHUCKLES

25:56.725 --> 25:59.964
Just setting the cruise control,
Hammond. Are you able to do that?

25:59.965 --> 26:03.684
Sorry, it's a bit windy in here.
I'm just going to close my roof.

26:03.685 --> 26:08.044
Have you closed yours already?
Oh, you can't open it!

26:08.045 --> 26:12.684
In all fairness, the Fiat and the
Citroen are very similarly equipped.

26:12.685 --> 26:16.164
There are more things on the Citroen,
but this has everything you need.

26:16.165 --> 26:21.285
Operate the stereo from the
steering wheel, electric windows,
electric roof that opens. Ha-ha!

26:22.725 --> 26:27.004
Meanwhile, very far behind,
Captain Sense Of Direction

26:27.005 --> 26:29.484
had finally found a way out of Lucca.

26:29.485 --> 26:33.205
Bursting out
into the sunlight... now.

26:36.405 --> 26:40.364
I don't doubt that the others
will be bleating on

26:40.365 --> 26:44.964
about how they have sat nav
or leather upholstery, or whatever.
But that's not the point.

26:44.965 --> 26:50.724
Renault has concentrated on the
things that make this a hot hatch
rather than just a hatchback.

26:50.725 --> 26:55.644
They know your money goes on the
engine, this lovely steering wheel,
this fabulous gear change.

26:55.645 --> 26:58.884
You get a dull interior.
It is very boring, very basic.

26:58.885 --> 27:01.485
But I want this car to drive.

27:11.045 --> 27:16.605
Soon, we were in the hills
and ready to start our challenge.

27:17.925 --> 27:19.484
A bicycle, dog.

27:19.485 --> 27:23.724
What else have we got? Ice cube.
Get that near the end or it'll melt.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.964
I'm going to pull in the here

27:25.965 --> 27:29.764
and attempt to buy a CD
without getting out of the car.

27:29.765 --> 27:32.645
Branch of a cedar tree...

27:33.925 --> 27:35.404
A vine.

27:35.405 --> 27:40.285
To make life harder,
the producers hadn't given us
any money to buy things.

27:42.325 --> 27:48.644
Fortunately, production has
supplied me with some
potential bartering items.

27:48.645 --> 27:54.125
I have a CD here of
Robson & Jerome's love songs,
and I've also got this one, the...

27:56.045 --> 27:59.004
A Cockney Christmas
with Chas & Dave.

27:59.005 --> 28:02.244
Do you speak English?
A little bit.

28:02.245 --> 28:08.884
Um... I may not get out of the car.
Chas & Dave -
molto popolare Inglese... um...

28:08.885 --> 28:10.844
I don't understand.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.484
BELL RINGS OUT

28:12.485 --> 28:18.164
Can you go really far? Really far.
Good, good, good.

28:18.165 --> 28:21.204
There's three in the front
rightaway.

28:21.205 --> 28:22.964
OK, let's go.

28:22.965 --> 28:26.205
Suspension's gone down a bit.
That's ten.

28:27.045 --> 28:29.724
In we go. Oh, thank you, madam,
for helping.

28:29.725 --> 28:34.844
Right, I reckon we'll get
another four in the front.
Oh, cyclist! You'll be thin.

28:34.845 --> 28:36.804
Skinny as a stick. Yes!

28:36.805 --> 28:39.405
Scusi, signora.

28:42.405 --> 28:45.525
It's his bottom. You've got
his bottom in your face there.

28:47.525 --> 28:48.884
12.

28:48.885 --> 28:50.724
13.

28:50.725 --> 28:52.924
It's the 13th.

28:52.925 --> 28:57.084
That is 13 people
in a Citroen DS3 Racing.

28:57.085 --> 28:59.884
Beat that, Hammond. Beat that, May.

28:59.885 --> 29:02.084
14. Count 'em up!

29:02.085 --> 29:05.404
Oh, that is magnificent.
That's for Italy.

29:05.405 --> 29:08.884
If I just do one for Italy, for Fiat.
Ya-ha! We're all excited.

29:08.885 --> 29:10.164
Er...

29:10.165 --> 29:11.685
Chas & Dave?

29:13.725 --> 29:16.165
Robson e Jerome? Molto bene.

29:21.405 --> 29:23.804
Since we had to be at
the finishing point by six

29:23.805 --> 29:30.164
and there were bonus points
for getting there first,
it became a very busy afternoon.

29:30.165 --> 29:32.844
Yes, that's a vineyard.

29:32.845 --> 29:38.564
TRANSLATION:

29:38.565 --> 29:42.004
No, the CD, OK? In the shop?

29:42.005 --> 29:45.684
Um, I'm a scientist

29:45.685 --> 29:50.044
and I'm investigating the possible
medicinal healing qualities of vines.

29:50.045 --> 29:54.284
Now, I am able to offer you
in part exchange

29:54.285 --> 29:57.844
this commemorative plate.
MAN GUFFAWS

29:57.845 --> 30:02.484
This! The swap. OK...

30:02.485 --> 30:05.764
For a vine... Si.

30:05.765 --> 30:13.125
I can give you molto valuable
Wills and Kate
souvenir wedding bell. Ah, OK.

30:14.205 --> 30:18.245
MUSIC PLAYS

30:19.445 --> 30:22.165
That is a good stereo.

30:25.325 --> 30:28.724
Can I just clarify, I'm not
looking for bicycles to steal.

30:28.725 --> 30:34.565
Anyway, there's a policeman there.
But it's a policeman on a bicycle.

30:40.045 --> 30:43.765
There you go. Off-roading.

30:45.565 --> 30:48.165
Oh! Is that a cedar tree?

30:50.805 --> 30:54.684
Citroen - pfff! Renault - ha!
Fiat... Fiat.

30:54.685 --> 30:56.364
Ha! Better.

30:56.365 --> 31:00.284
Very, very good, Fiat.
Yes, exactly.

31:00.285 --> 31:03.084
To show very good - bicycle in it.

31:03.085 --> 31:07.644
It's a police bike in a Fiat,
it's just better!

31:07.645 --> 31:09.125
Hang on.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.244
I'm so hot.

31:15.245 --> 31:17.765
HE GASPS

31:19.245 --> 31:22.365
How am I going to get
a bicycle in here as well?

31:28.285 --> 31:29.924
Grazie.

31:29.925 --> 31:32.164
Thank you. Thank you very much.

31:32.165 --> 31:34.925
You don't have police dogs, do you?
Eh? No, never mind.

31:38.285 --> 31:41.165
Oh, God! It smells terrible.

31:42.925 --> 31:45.244
There were now just 20 minutes left

31:45.245 --> 31:48.045
in which to scavenge
our remaining items.

31:49.285 --> 31:52.004
I've got to get a cube of ice.
Not difficult.

31:52.005 --> 31:54.204
A dog...

31:54.205 --> 31:58.485
How do you scavenge a dog?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.884
Come on. Come on.

32:04.885 --> 32:09.284
Right, the final thing, ice.

32:09.285 --> 32:12.044
Thank you so much for doing this.

32:12.045 --> 32:15.924
You are so kind. Tres gentil.

32:15.925 --> 32:18.325
Could you just stay here?
I have to get an ice cube.

32:18.326 --> 32:22.725
SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN
Uno minuto. OK.

32:24.205 --> 32:28.724
Really got to hurry now.
It's melting.

32:28.725 --> 32:31.204
Come on.

32:31.205 --> 32:33.164
Quicker, little Citroen.

32:33.165 --> 32:36.964
Have you ever been in a car with a
tree growing out of the back, Theo?

32:36.965 --> 32:38.885
Probably not.

32:40.645 --> 32:43.884
James, too, had found a dog,

32:43.885 --> 32:48.365
but sadly his speed was limited by
his ice-cube transportation system.

32:53.205 --> 32:56.925
Which meant there was plenty
of time for conversation.

32:58.445 --> 33:01.085
I like dogs and cats.

33:04.445 --> 33:06.564
I've just got a wet seat.

33:06.565 --> 33:09.004
That doesn't count.

33:09.005 --> 33:11.405
There's one left.

33:13.685 --> 33:16.885
SCRAPING
Sorry about the noise. It's
the tree dragging on the road.

33:17.885 --> 33:19.245
My ice cube is melting.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.765
It's very pretty here, isn't it?

33:29.645 --> 33:32.885
Now, come on. Don't melt.

33:33.765 --> 33:35.645
Coming through.

33:37.085 --> 33:41.084
SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN
Huh? Oh, it's there.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.605
THUD!
Ooh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

33:46.245 --> 33:48.684
Oh, no!

33:48.685 --> 33:50.884
Er, that's... OK, yes.

33:50.885 --> 33:56.804
That's an actual person.
Yes, yes. First of all, well
done, Hammond. Well done, well done.

33:56.805 --> 33:58.924
That's ice, as is that.

33:58.925 --> 34:00.524
As is that. Yes, it is.

34:00.525 --> 34:03.804
Where's your dog? It's not a dog.
Yes, it is.

34:03.805 --> 34:09.684
What this is, it's an acrylic fur
stuffed with industrial waste.
That's no way to talk about a dog.

34:09.685 --> 34:12.043
Yes, it is.
Do you think this is a dog, dog?

34:12.045 --> 34:16.965
Look at that.
That's proof enough for me!
You can have that, little friend.

34:18.125 --> 34:23.204
James arrived just as
the last of his ice cubes melted.

34:23.205 --> 34:25.324
Good evening. Good evening.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.484
This is Francesca. Hello, Francesca.

34:27.485 --> 34:30.244
Francesca, this is Jeremy
and Richard. Let me guess.

34:30.245 --> 34:34.205
Christ, has he made you pregnant?
No. No. You work fast, mate.

34:38.485 --> 34:40.764
APPLAUSE
Thank you.

34:42.925 --> 34:45.164
We'll pick that up...

34:45.165 --> 34:50.404
We'll pick that up later on,
but now it's time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

34:50.405 --> 34:52.844
My guest tonight is a comedian

34:52.844 --> 34:56.804
who spends his weekends with
other men dressed in leather.

34:56.804 --> 35:00.444
He's part of a minority group
called motorcyclists.

35:00.445 --> 35:04.444
Ladies and gentlemen, Ross Noble.
CHEERING

35:04.445 --> 35:09.684
Good to see you, mate. How are you?
I'm very well.

35:09.685 --> 35:13.124
Ross Noble, have a seat.
Thank you very much. Thanks.

35:13.125 --> 35:15.844
I just...

35:15.845 --> 35:20.044
Yeah, I just wanted to check because
I didn't realise that you actually

35:20.045 --> 35:24.604
have a lady wrangler.
You have somebody that just finds
all the good-looking women

35:24.605 --> 35:26.045
and pokes them with a stick.

35:26.046 --> 35:28.324
"Get to the front,
get to the front!"

35:28.325 --> 35:32.244
There's blokes in the middle
that literally come to this show

35:32.245 --> 35:37.045
so that when the ladies move through
they just stand there. "Mmm."

35:39.285 --> 35:42.404
I must move on, if we may. OK.

35:42.405 --> 35:46.044
I've got a list here of your bikes
that you currently own. Right? Yeah.

35:46.045 --> 35:51.924
Triumph Scrambler,
675R, Ducati Streetfighter. Yep.

35:51.925 --> 35:57.964
BMW 450, KTM 250, Gas Gas 250
and a 1974 Norton Commando.

35:57.965 --> 36:03.004
Why would you have so many, cos
they're all the same? That's quite
funny, cos since your researcher

36:03.005 --> 36:05.924
talked to me about that,
I've bought another one,

36:05.925 --> 36:07.805
just to annoy you!
Make bikes live for us.

36:07.806 --> 36:11.804
I don't understand. They've
no styling. Why are they different?

36:11.805 --> 36:17.564
To me, a car is a big box of metal
with somebody sitting inside it.

36:17.565 --> 36:19.964
A bike, it's like you're
part of the bike.

36:19.965 --> 36:24.204
You move on a bike
and you look where you want to go
and the bike goes.

36:24.205 --> 36:26.524
You see what I mean?
You can move around on it.

36:26.525 --> 36:31.804
But do you not get...?
Granted, granted, you can't have
a sandwich while you're doing it

36:31.805 --> 36:34.924
but I'm working on that.
I'm going to go on Dragons' Den with

36:34.925 --> 36:40.084
some sort of sandwich spring
that I can ride along and go...

36:40.085 --> 36:44.284
I can tell you don't like cars
cos I've got a list
of your past car history.

36:44.285 --> 36:47.004
MG Metro, Cavalier.

36:47.005 --> 36:52.244
All these cars met with terrible
ends, didn't they, largely?
Yes. I have no...

36:52.245 --> 36:56.124
What I like about a bike is,
if you get it wrong, you die.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.244
You see what I mean?

36:58.245 --> 37:00.884
What's good about that,
it sort of keeps me on my toes.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.324
Whereas with a car...

37:03.325 --> 37:07.644
I've got this Land Rover, I had
a couple of tractors as well

37:07.645 --> 37:09.684
cos we still live in the country.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.644
My wife had... You know
those big round bales of hay?

37:12.645 --> 37:17.204
She said, "Can you move that into
the bottom field?"
"Yeah, easy enough."

37:17.205 --> 37:20.524
I tried pushing it. A bit tricky,
so I thought, "What I'll do

37:20.525 --> 37:25.644
"is gently nudge it with a car, the
Land Rover. They're built for it."

37:25.645 --> 37:27.964
So I went...
MAKES ENGINE NOISE

37:27.965 --> 37:31.764
Crunch! And nothing happened.
I thought, "I'm going
to have to go faster."

37:31.765 --> 37:35.844
So I floored it into this bale
of hay. I went, "Here we go,"

37:35.845 --> 37:42.244
and it went "bang"!
Instead of pushing it,
the car mounted the bale of hay

37:42.245 --> 37:47.004
so it just looked like the Land
Rover was humping the bale of hay.

37:47.005 --> 37:49.405
Then the second one I wrote off.

37:51.805 --> 37:53.884
I lived on...
It was old gravel roads

37:53.885 --> 37:56.724
and I forgot I wasn't Colin McRae.

37:56.725 --> 38:01.724
The back of the car started to sort
of overtake me a bit and I thought,

38:01.725 --> 38:03.604
"That can't be good."

38:03.605 --> 38:07.164
As it came round, the car went
up on two wheels

38:07.165 --> 38:10.964
and then it went onto its side and
I started sliding down this hill.

38:10.965 --> 38:15.364
My wife's lip balm hit me in
the face. There was crap everywhere
and dust.

38:15.365 --> 38:19.165
The sat-nav just went,
"Off route, recalculating."

38:21.685 --> 38:25.444
I had to crawl out the back.
Was that in Australia? Yes, it was.

38:25.445 --> 38:29.804
You were unlucky in Australia
cos you got caught up
in those awful fires,

38:29.805 --> 38:32.764
round Melbourne way, wasn't it,
in 2009? That's right.

38:32.765 --> 38:38.244
We heard about them on the news
here, these bush fires,
but these were beyond belief.

38:38.245 --> 38:42.964
Beyond anything you could possibly
imagine. Literally, it torched...

38:42.965 --> 38:47.244
There was nothing left.
Our house was...

38:47.245 --> 38:53.564
We had an oven, like one of these
wood-burning stove things.

38:53.565 --> 38:57.564
You can heat them up to 2,000
degrees, and that had smashed

38:57.565 --> 39:00.444
and melted on the top.
That gives you an idea.

39:00.445 --> 39:03.564
How fast do those fires move?

39:03.565 --> 39:08.684
Normally a fire goes...
I think it's a metre a minute

39:08.685 --> 39:11.524
and these things just, you know...

39:11.525 --> 39:15.524
There were people trying to outrun
it and couldn't do it in cars.

39:15.525 --> 39:18.484
So how did you get out?
I wasn't there, luckily.

39:18.485 --> 39:23.684
Were the family there?
Yeah, my wife was driving
along with the flames behind her.

39:23.685 --> 39:29.724
Yeah. How fast did she have to go?
I don't think she was looking
at the speedo, to be honest!

39:29.725 --> 39:31.684
She absolutely was...?

39:31.685 --> 39:36.644
Yeah, there were flames behind her
and it was all coming down.

39:36.645 --> 39:41.284
They were horrible and I don't
think we really realise in this
country how horrible.

39:41.285 --> 39:45.804
Yeah, it was something like
50 times the Hiroshima bomb,

39:45.805 --> 39:51.564
that was the area of destruction.
So you've come back
to live in England now?

39:51.565 --> 39:54.404
I have. Down in Kent.
Have you bought some land there?

39:54.405 --> 39:56.964
I have. Is it the country living?
Organic farming?

39:56.965 --> 40:01.884
Oh, yeah. It's all organic,
the whole lot. Cheese-making.
Not really.

40:01.885 --> 40:03.964
What have you done
with your paddock?

40:03.965 --> 40:10.124
I have bought 150 traffic cones
off the internet and turned it

40:10.125 --> 40:12.724
into a motorcycle racing track.

40:12.725 --> 40:16.084
Which the neighbour's not too
happy about, to be honest.

40:16.085 --> 40:18.404
Does he overlook your paddock?

40:18.405 --> 40:22.084
He does when he stands on a ladder
and shakes his...

40:22.085 --> 40:25.604
I shouldn't be saying this on
the telly. It's a bit of a...

40:25.605 --> 40:31.324
But, no. I mean, I love getting
out there and I've got tractors,

40:31.325 --> 40:37.004
I've got earth-moving equipment. Oh!
And also, I bought a tank.

40:37.005 --> 40:42.044
What sort of tank is yours?
Mine is an Abbot 433.

40:42.045 --> 40:45.804
That's a self-propelled gun,
though, isn't it? Listen to you!

40:45.805 --> 40:51.244
Military purists would say
that's self-propelled artillery.

40:51.245 --> 40:52.365
It looks like a tank.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.285
But when it comes up
behind you down the shops...

40:57.445 --> 41:01.364
This is the thing. It was one of
the best days of my life, actually.

41:01.365 --> 41:03.884
When I got the tank delivered -
cos it's massive...

41:03.885 --> 41:06.604
and the guy brings it
on a low-loader thing.

41:06.605 --> 41:10.884
He turns up and says,
"There's no way that's going to go
up the country lanes.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.644
"We're going to have to get the tank
off and drive it to your house."

41:14.645 --> 41:21.604
The tank is there, my car is here,
and this is possibly the greatest
motoring experience of my life.

41:21.605 --> 41:24.084
I'm driving along, in me Hilux.
I come through.

41:24.085 --> 41:28.284
There are two hedges either side and
I drive halfway through and the tank

41:28.285 --> 41:30.765
is trying to keep up.
He's going as fast as he can.

41:30.766 --> 41:34.964
I stop and a little old fellow
comes round the corner.

41:34.965 --> 41:37.724
Now I've gone further down
the narrow bit than he has

41:37.725 --> 41:40.804
and he stopped.
And I went, "Go back."

41:40.805 --> 41:43.724
And he went, "No."

41:43.725 --> 41:48.804
You know when you just think, "I
couldn't have set this up better."

41:48.805 --> 41:54.005
I went, "Go back",
and he went, "No." I went...

41:56.445 --> 41:59.004
And the gun appeared
and the guy went,

41:59.005 --> 42:00.844
"Oh, bloody hell!"

42:00.845 --> 42:05.204
Murray Mints flying all over.
Are you actually allowed
to drive it on the road?

42:05.205 --> 42:07.884
Not only are you allowed
to drive it on the road,

42:07.885 --> 42:12.044
it's congestion-charge exempt.
How good is that?!

42:12.045 --> 42:14.405
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

42:16.085 --> 42:22.204
Oh, I love that. This is great.
I have to say, the lap...

42:22.205 --> 42:26.324
Yes. We've heard about your
car history. It's shocking.
So did you crash?

42:26.325 --> 42:28.444
Today? Yeah. Yep.

42:28.445 --> 42:31.084
LAUGHTER

42:31.085 --> 42:34.564
Does anybody want to see the clip
of the first attempt?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

42:34.565 --> 42:35.884
Let's have a look.

42:35.885 --> 42:40.605
Here we are, coming after the second
to last corner. Here's Gambon.

42:47.845 --> 42:50.444
Cutting the corner can help!

42:50.445 --> 42:53.724
Who would like to see
the actual lap?

42:53.725 --> 42:56.485
AUDIENCE: Yes!
OK, let's play the tape.

42:58.445 --> 43:01.244
That's good. And...

43:01.245 --> 43:06.284
US ACCENT: It looks like them
Duke boys dumped themselves
in a whole heap of trouble.

43:06.285 --> 43:10.284
Right, there we go, first corner.
TYRES SCREECH

43:10.285 --> 43:11.684
Tortured tyres.

43:11.685 --> 43:15.084
Squealing like a pig, boy!
Squeal like a pig.

43:15.085 --> 43:17.084
Alice Cooper was talking about pigs.

43:17.085 --> 43:19.885
Drive it like you've stolen it.

43:21.365 --> 43:22.885
That's a wide line.

43:27.485 --> 43:30.364
Oh! Ooh!

43:30.365 --> 43:34.444
Some valves coming out of the bonnet
now as we turn into the Hammerhead,

43:34.445 --> 43:37.124
keeping it nicely between the lines.
That looks very fast.

43:37.125 --> 43:38.605
You've gone into a trance.

43:41.645 --> 43:46.764
Flat out... Flat out through here.
There we go. Woo-hoo!

43:46.765 --> 43:48.805
TYRES SCREECH

43:54.285 --> 43:57.764
Best to keep your eyes open
on that bit. Well, you know.

43:57.765 --> 43:59.684
Let's have a look. This is...

43:59.685 --> 44:01.764
That was absolute bang on.

44:01.765 --> 44:05.244
And cutting it again
or have we learned our lesson? No?

44:05.245 --> 44:07.844
I say, gosh! That is...
AUDIENCE GASP

44:07.845 --> 44:09.884
very good.

44:09.885 --> 44:12.805
That was a good couple
of last corners there.

44:16.085 --> 44:19.244
These are the times.

44:19.245 --> 44:20.964
Where do you think?

44:20.965 --> 44:22.884
Who's another biker on there?

44:22.885 --> 44:24.684
Eh... Bill Bailey. Is he a biker?

44:24.685 --> 44:28.564
No. Do you really want
to see Bill on a bike?

44:28.565 --> 44:30.005
Eh... Um... Oh...

44:33.685 --> 44:37.204
No, I don't, actually. I tell
you what, Tom Cruise is a biker.

44:37.205 --> 44:41.284
Oh, yeah. All right, I'll be
one ahead of Tom Cruise then.

44:41.285 --> 44:43.404
Just put me out of my misery.

44:43.405 --> 44:46.924
One... Right.

44:46.925 --> 44:48.205
40...

44:51.045 --> 44:53.524
Tom Cruise is 1.44.2. Oh, stop it!

44:53.525 --> 44:58.364
You're 1.43... AUDIENCE: Whoo!

44:58.365 --> 45:01.565
Ladies and gentlemen,
the second fastest man...

45:03.165 --> 45:06.644
we've ever had! Ross Noble!

45:06.645 --> 45:09.404
CHEERING, WHISTLING
Thank you very much.

45:09.405 --> 45:12.245
Bloody hell!

45:13.445 --> 45:15.724
Yeah.

45:15.725 --> 45:17.804
I have to say,

45:17.805 --> 45:20.124
it's those last two corners.

45:20.125 --> 45:22.364
They were absolutely perfect.

45:22.365 --> 45:27.444
Aw, look, I was beaten
by another Northern comic.

45:27.445 --> 45:32.644
The Northern comics are the fastest
people in the world,
as it turns out.

45:32.645 --> 45:36.124
Yeah. Do you know how quickly
we get home from our gigs?

45:36.125 --> 45:42.645
Ladies and gentlemen, nearly
a record-breaker, all-round good
guy, Ross Noble. Thank you.

45:48.925 --> 45:53.604
Now, tonight we are reviewing
the boring Renault Clio Cup...

45:53.605 --> 45:54.645
It's not boring.

45:54.646 --> 45:57.524
Yes, it is.
..the childish Citroen DS3 Racing

45:57.525 --> 46:00.204
and the excellent Fiat 500 Abarth.

46:00.205 --> 46:03.004
So far we've found out
what they're like in town,

46:03.005 --> 46:06.084
what they're like at
being hatchbacks, but now it's time

46:06.085 --> 46:09.404
to find out what they're like
when you put your foot down.

46:09.405 --> 46:12.084
The producers told us
to leave our overnight halt,

46:12.085 --> 46:16.445
here in the foothills of the Italian
Alps, and drive to Monaco down here.

46:33.245 --> 46:35.404
Right, at last.

46:35.405 --> 46:38.724
A chance to drive this little thing.

46:38.725 --> 46:41.084
Steering just feels fabulous.

46:41.085 --> 46:44.325
Oh! A little crackle
and bang on the overrun.

46:48.165 --> 46:50.604
Oh, yes, this thing grips.

46:50.605 --> 46:56.164
The grip is helped, no doubt,
by being short and fat,

46:56.165 --> 46:58.004
so it's square on the road.

46:58.005 --> 47:00.004
Oh!

47:00.005 --> 47:03.165
I don't think I'd change
anything about this.

47:07.165 --> 47:11.084
In a straight line, this is
by far the fastest of the three.

47:11.085 --> 47:15.044
0-60, 6.5 seconds.

47:15.045 --> 47:19.324
The funny thing is,
even though it's called "the Racing"

47:19.325 --> 47:23.604
and it was designed
by Citroen's motorsport division,

47:23.605 --> 47:27.004
it doesn't actually feel like
a racing car or a rally car.

47:27.005 --> 47:31.124
It feels soft,
it feels very Citroeny, quiet.

47:31.125 --> 47:33.404
And then there's the steering.

47:33.405 --> 47:35.524
There's no feel to it at all.

47:35.525 --> 47:40.684
You sort of have to guess how much
lock to put in for each corner.

47:40.685 --> 47:42.965
Is it this much? No, more.

47:49.805 --> 47:51.564
Here's a fact.

47:51.565 --> 47:55.364
Hammond has a 1.4 litre
turbocharged engine,

47:55.365 --> 47:58.764
Jeremy has a 1.6 litre
turbocharged engine.

47:58.765 --> 48:03.964
I have two litres,
no turbocharger, and that's
important because there's no lag.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.804
There you go.
Through the bend, there's the power.

48:06.805 --> 48:11.364
The trouble was, though, it wasn't
actually getting me anywhere.

48:11.365 --> 48:15.364
Hammond's little boot thing
takes off like a rocket.

48:15.365 --> 48:17.804
He's getting away!

48:17.805 --> 48:21.724
The problem with that Renault is,
brilliant though the suspension is
and so on,

48:21.725 --> 48:26.725
it weighs more than the QE2 and you
can see that coming out of
the corners. It doesn't get going.

48:28.685 --> 48:32.124
Though that could have
something to do with its driver.

48:32.125 --> 48:35.285
An interesting old bell tower
over there.

48:36.885 --> 48:39.685
Eventually we reached the Riviera.

48:43.085 --> 48:46.324
There's the Mediterranean,
glistening blue, which is amazing

48:46.325 --> 48:49.084
considering how many turds
there are in it.

48:49.085 --> 48:54.684
As we approached Monte Carlo,
I heard a familiar sound.

48:54.685 --> 48:57.645
ENGINES ROAR
Chaps...

48:59.285 --> 49:02.204
I think the Grand Prix is on.

49:02.205 --> 49:03.764
Oh, my God,

49:03.765 --> 49:07.965
I think, down there...
Which Grand Prix?

49:10.365 --> 49:16.404
Have either of you two ever watched
the Monaco Grand Prix? I think
I watched it in the early '80s.

49:16.405 --> 49:18.604
That's the one in the town, right?

49:18.605 --> 49:23.404
Never has anyone had to work
with such imbeciles.

49:23.405 --> 49:29.364
In the hills above Monaco, we were
told to pull over for a challenge.

49:29.365 --> 49:31.204
ENGINES ROAR
I love that sound.

49:31.205 --> 49:36.444
"Tomorrow, you will do three laps
of the Monaco Grand Prix track.

49:36.445 --> 49:39.924
"Whoever posts
the fastest time wins."

49:39.925 --> 49:41.804
The Monaco Grand Prix track?

49:41.805 --> 49:44.085
I'm going to drive around... That?!

49:45.885 --> 49:50.444
My hair is just... Seriously,
that is just the boyhood dream!

49:50.445 --> 49:55.244
Hang on, if we've got to do
hot laps of the actual... That puts
you at a bit of an advantage.

49:55.245 --> 49:58.804
Not really. I've never actually
driven round it
when it's a racetrack.

49:58.805 --> 50:03.644
I don't know the fastest line
through Rascasse!
I don't know what Rascasse is!

50:03.645 --> 50:07.284
I don't know where it goes.
You know how difficult
I find it remembering a track.

50:07.285 --> 50:10.884
Am I going to get a go round?
Can I look at a picture of it?
I don't know!

50:10.885 --> 50:13.445
Exactly! I'll be driving
around a foreign town.

50:15.565 --> 50:21.764
When the Grand Prix practice was
over, we went in search of some F1
drivers so we could get some tips.

50:21.765 --> 50:24.644
And immediately,
I found David Coulthard.

50:24.645 --> 50:30.764
And the key here is speed up the
hill, not speed into St Devote.

50:30.765 --> 50:34.084
Concentrate on
really getting that car turned,

50:34.085 --> 50:37.924
early on the power, because what
you gain here, if you get on
the power two metres early,

50:37.925 --> 50:40.884
you'll add five kilometres an hour
to your top speed.

50:40.885 --> 50:45.204
So there is a noticeable crest
there? Yes. You'll see as you're
coming over the crest.

50:45.205 --> 50:50.124
You've got a lot of grippy tarmac
there. On the apex? On the apex.

50:50.125 --> 50:53.124
Meanwhile, down in the harbour,

50:53.125 --> 50:56.724
my colleagues had been rather
distracted by all the parties.

50:56.725 --> 50:59.164
Thank you, gentlemen. Oh!

50:59.165 --> 51:02.284
Look confident.
Look like you do this all the time.

51:02.285 --> 51:05.444
Grab that woman with the things
on sticks. What?

51:05.445 --> 51:08.284
Where would you try
in a road car to go by?

51:08.285 --> 51:11.844
A good run through
the tunnel and then on the brakes.
The left-right?

51:11.845 --> 51:18.364
So, over the crest, then as soon as
you see his brake lights come on,
count and you're in.

51:18.365 --> 51:20.404
And then go on the left, stay left?
Yeah.

51:20.405 --> 51:23.644
We're doing a bit of driving
around the track, you know,

51:23.645 --> 51:26.044
analysing some of the corners.

51:26.045 --> 51:32.324
So, if you live in Monaco, do you
drive around where the track is?
All the time. Good.

51:32.325 --> 51:35.284
What hints have you got for me? I've
got to drive around it tomorrow...

51:35.285 --> 51:39.004
Use the kerbs at four and five.
It gives more grip.

51:39.005 --> 51:40.604
Four and five? Yeah.

51:40.605 --> 51:44.164
And at Rascasse, I can take a lot of
entry speed into that... Yeah.

51:44.165 --> 51:46.884
..and then use the front-wheel drive
to wash it off?

51:46.885 --> 51:53.524
Well, it's very much a party
sort of place. It has
very elegant properties.

51:53.525 --> 51:59.285
It's like Monaco in many ways,
actually.
Have you ever been to Hammersmith?

52:00.525 --> 52:04.644
At the end of the evening,
we met up to compare notes.

52:04.645 --> 52:07.964
Have you found anything
about the track out?

52:07.965 --> 52:11.884
Yes, I have. It's just over there,
there's all these boats,
and it's really busy.

52:11.885 --> 52:16.324
Have you talked to a single
racing driver? Yes, we have. Who?

52:16.325 --> 52:20.844
A very nice man called
Tim O'Glock. An Irishman...

52:20.845 --> 52:23.365
Timo Glock! Timo Glock, yes.

52:31.685 --> 52:35.684
The next morning,
the producers decided that because
the track has no run-off areas,

52:35.685 --> 52:40.684
and is very dangerous, none
of us could drive around it unless
we had a bit of tuition first.

52:40.685 --> 52:45.244
Richard's tutor was Red Bull
team boss Christian Horner.

52:45.245 --> 52:49.684
I got former Renault boss
Flavio Briatore.

52:49.685 --> 52:52.804
And Jeremy was given
an elderly gentleman.

52:52.805 --> 52:55.364
Bernie Ecclestone.

52:55.365 --> 53:00.444
Bernie Ecclestone, as I live and
breathe! How are you this morning?
Good. Michel!

53:00.445 --> 53:07.444
Bernie? Listen, we need these
other two cars disqualified, huh?
No problem, no problem!

53:07.445 --> 53:10.044
It was time to begin.

53:10.045 --> 53:12.764
There's a flag waving.
Oh, we're off.

53:12.765 --> 53:16.764
Try and hook a right here.
We have to stay left, I reckon.

53:16.765 --> 53:20.524
No, you have to go there.
JEREMY LAUGHS

53:20.525 --> 53:25.924
Bernie, you old cheat!
We gained a bit! We gained a lot!

53:25.925 --> 53:28.764
Let's go over to the right a bit,
shall we?

53:28.765 --> 53:33.444
And then... What was that lift,
what was that lift?! I didn't need
to lift there, did I? No!

53:33.445 --> 53:38.764
JAMES: I have to slow a bit.
Further. Go down with the gears.
Jesus Christ!

53:38.765 --> 53:42.604
That's a tight right. Brake, brake,
brake. What are you doing?

53:42.605 --> 53:44.845
Brake. Oh, my God!

53:47.645 --> 53:51.804
There are actually people watching
as well. What do they expect,
I wonder.

53:51.805 --> 53:53.605
They expect an accident.

53:57.845 --> 54:02.445
You lifted it! I'm terrified!
I don't know what's going to happen!
Oh, God!

54:03.525 --> 54:05.804
JAMES: It's secondo for this one.

54:05.805 --> 54:07.964
Just brake, Jesus Christ.

54:07.965 --> 54:11.004
Be careful now, huh? Yep.
Left, right...

54:11.005 --> 54:12.564
It's too complicated, this.

54:12.565 --> 54:17.364
Get the kerb on the left.
You missed it. Get the curb
on the right. You missed it.

54:17.365 --> 54:18.844
Try and get this kerb.

54:18.845 --> 54:21.284
Christ, we missed that one as well!

54:21.285 --> 54:23.604
Now, Rascasse. Brake now.

54:23.605 --> 54:26.164
Oh, really late? Accelerate now.

54:26.165 --> 54:29.604
Tuition over,
we ditched the teachers...

54:29.605 --> 54:32.444
That was good. Come on,
that was good! Jesus Christ.

54:32.445 --> 54:35.484
..and set off on our warm-up lap.

54:35.485 --> 54:39.844
I am out of my depth to a degree
I've never before experienced.

54:39.845 --> 54:44.445
The crowds were beside themselves
as we started our first lap.

54:46.085 --> 54:47.565
Here we go.

54:51.045 --> 54:52.924
OK.

54:52.925 --> 54:54.565
Now, this creeps up on you.

54:59.925 --> 55:03.525
Whoa! BLEEP! BLEEP!

55:07.085 --> 55:10.805
I'm struggling, I'm struggling!
Come on, Rich!

55:15.805 --> 55:19.365
Wait till you can see the Armco
before braking. That's now.

55:29.725 --> 55:33.965
Flavio corner.
ITALIAN ACCENT: Jesus Christ-ah!

55:42.525 --> 55:43.765
I caught them up.

55:45.685 --> 55:49.245
Well late going in there.
Get in, get in.

55:52.125 --> 55:54.244
It is simply terrifying.
You just have no...

55:54.245 --> 55:57.925
I mean, look - fine, dead.

56:07.365 --> 56:10.564
Oh, dear God. That's Hammond
dealt with in the tunnel.

56:10.565 --> 56:13.084
Now, James will not
know where he's going.

56:13.085 --> 56:15.524
OK, now we come down
to the chicane, I think.

56:15.525 --> 56:18.085
Or is it Raser-ma-casse-er-ma-casse?

56:21.805 --> 56:25.245
Jezzer's going to have me
here, I can feel it coming.

56:29.805 --> 56:32.325
Under-braking.
Get the grip from the zebra.

56:34.365 --> 56:35.845
Got him.

56:38.005 --> 56:38.805
Get this kerb.

56:43.365 --> 56:45.484
Ooh, this is risky.
I don't know the way!

56:45.485 --> 56:48.404
Hammond, you bugger.

56:48.405 --> 56:51.925
Oh, God almighty!
I may have cocked that up a bit.

56:54.605 --> 56:59.005
We now had just one lap left.
It had to be a fast one.

57:02.845 --> 57:06.044
My last ever lap
of the Monaco Grand Prix track.

57:06.045 --> 57:08.484
Don't mess
this corner up again, Jeremy.

57:08.485 --> 57:10.005
Whoa!

57:11.885 --> 57:14.564
JEREMY LAUGHS

57:14.565 --> 57:18.205
Just leave it in third.

57:20.365 --> 57:22.205
Change into second.

57:24.925 --> 57:26.045
That was better.

57:26.046 --> 57:29.285
ITALIAN ACCENT: Careful,
the barrier! It comes out-ah.

57:30.725 --> 57:33.045
Get it in now.

57:44.605 --> 57:45.885
Flat, flat, flat!

57:48.405 --> 57:49.484
Oh!

57:49.485 --> 57:54.205
Aargh! He's getting away!
My mighty Fiat roaring
in the tunnel at Monaco!

57:56.485 --> 57:58.485
Topless women. Mustn't look.

58:00.125 --> 58:03.525
I can see why racing drivers love
this track. You are just on it.

58:11.525 --> 58:14.725
Don't... Oh, God, strewth.

58:16.405 --> 58:18.885
I think this is it.

58:20.405 --> 58:22.405
Come on, everything you can.

58:25.885 --> 58:28.604
Oh, my God!

58:28.605 --> 58:31.804
What an extraordinary day!

58:31.805 --> 58:33.964
JEREMY LAUGHS

58:33.965 --> 58:37.324
I have to say,
that's pretty special.

58:37.325 --> 58:41.804
What a fantastic moment.

58:41.805 --> 58:47.005
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you so much!

58:50.285 --> 58:56.085
CHEERING, APPLAUSE
That was amazing. It was.

58:58.765 --> 59:01.204
I really do mean that.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.844
I really do mean that.

59:02.845 --> 59:06.444
I've never had a day I've
enjoyed more, working, than that.

59:06.445 --> 59:11.524
It was amazing. I'm not exactly
steeped in F1 folklore, but still,

59:11.525 --> 59:15.244
that was the most amazing track
driving experience I've ever had.

59:15.245 --> 59:17.724
And I've always thought
the Monaco track worked

59:17.725 --> 59:22.884
because of where it was, the harbour
and the palace. But you could pick
it up and put it in a field

59:22.885 --> 59:26.564
in Lancashire, and it would still be
a fantastic thing to drive around.

59:26.565 --> 59:31.764
Yeah, absolutely. It would
certainly be better than
the Nurburgring, wouldn't it?

59:31.765 --> 59:35.004
LAUGHTER
It is now time to work out
which of these cars is best.

59:35.005 --> 59:38.324
We begin with the
getting out of Lucca challenge.

59:38.325 --> 59:42.444
Jeremy, I believe you arrived first.
Yeah. So you get ten points.

59:42.445 --> 59:45.484
Good. Hammond, you were second,
so you get five points.

59:45.485 --> 59:48.964
And I, of course, was last
so I only get two points.

59:48.965 --> 59:54.884
However, the producers have said
that any man who loses his car

59:54.885 --> 59:59.644
in the city is actually
disqualified. So, Hammond,
I'm afraid you've got nought.

59:59.645 --> 01:00:03.964
Oh, I can see where
this is going already.

01:00:03.965 --> 01:00:06.404
Nought for that.
Now, the scavenger hunt...

01:00:06.405 --> 01:00:11.284
er, Hammond, you finished first,
so you get ten points.

01:00:11.285 --> 01:00:13.404
I was second so I get five.

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:15.484
James, you were last so you get two.

01:00:15.485 --> 01:00:17.924
However, because your
ice cube had melted,

01:00:17.925 --> 01:00:20.764
I'm afraid you lose a point for
that so you actually only get one.

01:00:20.765 --> 01:00:23.844
Oh, dear. Interestingly enough,
Hammond, the producers said

01:00:23.845 --> 01:00:29.764
that because your dog wasn't real,
that is minus two points.
Minus two? Yes.

01:00:29.765 --> 01:00:34.884
And also because your cedar tree
turned out to be a larch,
that's another minus two.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:39.844
Yeah, and finally, you didn't get
a CD. So that's minus...
Oh, let me guess! Is it six?

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:43.404
Yes, it is! Is it? Is it really?

01:00:43.405 --> 01:00:47.164
So, six and two... Is nought.
Yes, it is. Nought for that.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:51.644
People in the car -
James, you got 12.

01:00:51.645 --> 01:00:56.204
I got 13 in the Citroen.
And you got nought.

01:00:56.205 --> 01:00:58.484
I got 14 for that. What?

01:00:58.485 --> 01:01:03.764
I got 14! No, the producers have said
that because your people weren't
actually in your convertible,

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:08.404
there were sort of on it, you were
disqualified, so... They were in it!
Oh, for God's sake.

01:01:08.405 --> 01:01:13.124
Nought. Now, the big one,
the lap times. Hammond...

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.124
I did it in the Fiat in
two minutes 20 seconds.

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:18.324
Ooh, two minutes 21.

01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:19.364
Close.

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:21.044
This is tricky.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:24.804
Well, I've got to look pleased
now, haven't I, without being smug?

01:01:24.805 --> 01:01:27.124
You're not pulling that off.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.444
Two minutes 15. Oh, God.

01:01:29.445 --> 01:01:32.244
So, I get ten points. Do you?

01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:36.124
Er, wait a minute, you get...

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.044
Well, it can't be nought
this time, can it? I finished!

01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:44.164
You get five, and you get...
I'm afraid last again,
so that's another two.

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:47.204
OK, so, let's tot up the totals.

01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:50.924
Jeremy, you have 38.

01:01:50.925 --> 01:01:53.244
Excellent. The Citroen has won.

01:01:53.245 --> 01:01:59.164
I've got 17, and Hammond, I'm
afraid you have five. Five.

01:01:59.165 --> 01:02:02.644
No, you see, he doesn't. Really?
No, because the producer said

01:02:02.645 --> 01:02:06.324
it was a test of hot hatchbacks,
and you must have a points deduction

01:02:06.325 --> 01:02:08.844
for turning up
in a car that wasn't a hatchback.

01:02:08.845 --> 01:02:12.204
Really? How many points does
he lose for that?

01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:16.004
It's five. Is it really?!
LAUGHTER

01:02:16.005 --> 01:02:20.004
So, I get nought... again. Yes.

01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:24.844
And on that bombshell, it's time
to end. Thank you very much
for watching. Good night!

01:02:24.845 --> 01:02:27.485
