WEBVTT

00:00.983 --> 00:02.318
Splendid. Yes.

00:02.386 --> 00:05.521
And we'll work out all
the details when... hm?

00:06.082 --> 00:09.422
Yes, it sounds amazing, it really
does, but...

00:09.542 --> 00:12.170
We'll talk about it when
you get here.

00:12.290 --> 00:14.582
Hm? Mm.

00:15.134 --> 00:16.775
Something on your mind, dear?

00:16.895 --> 00:17.930
Not anymore.

00:17.999 --> 00:20.532
What in the... a microchip?

00:20.601 --> 00:23.218
Russian markings?
What on earth is this?

00:23.338 --> 00:26.466
Krieger thinks it's some kind of
satellite-linked mind-control device.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.695
Mind control?
Why does he think that?

00:28.815 --> 00:31.253
- Because he removed it from my brain?
- What?!

00:31.373 --> 00:34.210
I told Krieger about my headaches,
he gives me a cat-scan, then boom.

00:34.279 --> 00:38.114
Next thing I know he shoots me full of
some kinda, I dunno, fish paralyzer...

00:38.183 --> 00:41.141
- That crazy...
- And then it was drill, baby, drill.

00:41.261 --> 00:43.787
Oh my God,
how do you feel?

00:43.907 --> 00:45.505
Little pissed off, actually.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.576
- Well that's understan...
- Because it was obviously

00:47.696 --> 00:52.023
put in my brain in the first place by
your boyfriend, Nikolai Jakov of the KGB!

00:52.143 --> 00:54.635
Sterling, first of all we're not
even together anymore...

00:54.755 --> 00:56.786
- I bet.
- And second of all!

00:56.906 --> 00:59.722
Why would he put a mind-control
chip into your brain?

00:59.842 --> 01:01.657
I assume because
he thinks he's my father!

01:01.777 --> 01:05.223
And what, you think he wanted to...
mind-control you into loving him?

01:05.343 --> 01:08.142
You tell me!
That's your specialty!

01:08.210 --> 01:09.468
- Get out.
- No.

01:09.588 --> 01:10.449
Yes!

01:10.569 --> 01:13.214
Mother, you've been
lying to me my entire life!

01:13.334 --> 01:15.677
Just for once, I want you
to tell me the truth!

01:15.797 --> 01:18.017
Well, people in
hell want ice water.

01:18.086 --> 01:21.935
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm right
in the middle of a fairly huge deal.

01:27.246 --> 01:28.788
Buying a lock factory?

01:28.908 --> 01:30.497
For your information,
I'm... no,

01:30.566 --> 01:33.133
never mind,
you'll find out soon enough as it is.

01:33.202 --> 01:35.229
Oh, that's classic you!

01:35.349 --> 01:37.415
Avoid the truth, bury the secrets,
hide the...

01:37.535 --> 01:40.340
- Oh for the...I'm selling ISIS!
- You what?!

01:40.409 --> 01:42.380
There! Happy?

01:43.711 --> 01:44.725
No.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.866
Mother, tell
me this is a joke!

02:21.986 --> 02:24.073
The only joke
is my bank statement.

02:24.193 --> 02:25.247
What?

02:25.367 --> 02:28.798
Everything I had was in a hedge
fund, but it turns out the whole thing

02:28.918 --> 02:31.302
was nothing but a damn Ponzi scheme...

02:31.422 --> 02:34.108
I lost all my money.
I'm ruined.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.387
so you're selling ISIS?

02:38.759 --> 02:39.758
She what?!

02:39.827 --> 02:43.031
Aww, maaan...
That's totally not iree.

02:43.151 --> 02:44.696
Then why don't
you go back to Jamaica?

02:44.764 --> 02:49.171
A, because I got deported, and B...
So can she actually sell ISIS?

02:49.291 --> 02:50.582
Like, doesn't the government own it?

02:50.702 --> 02:52.153
Yeah, I've
never been clear on that.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.379
It's way too complicated to
explain, especially to you two,

02:55.499 --> 02:58.329
but short answer yes,
she can sell ISIS.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.646
The question is, who would buy it?

03:00.715 --> 03:01.614
ODIN?!

03:01.683 --> 03:03.082
CHERYL/CAROL Or whom...

03:04.370 --> 03:05.902
Yes, ODIN.

03:06.022 --> 03:09.825
Why would ODIN want to buy...
Oh my God, is Len Trexler behind this?!

03:09.893 --> 03:12.194
He made me a
very attractive offer.

03:12.262 --> 03:12.961
I bet!

03:13.030 --> 03:16.565
That's because he wants to...
you know, that! With you!

03:16.633 --> 03:19.201
- But... wait a minute, does he know you're...
- Gorgeous!

03:19.270 --> 03:20.603
Hello, Leonard!

03:20.723 --> 03:22.238
Hello, beautiful!

03:22.307 --> 03:23.207
Hey, kiddo.

03:23.327 --> 03:26.015
Hey back and if you don't mind,
we're kind of in the middle of something?!

03:26.135 --> 03:27.830
Actually Sterling,
if you don't mind?

03:27.950 --> 03:30.045
Len and I have a lot to talk about.

03:30.165 --> 03:32.516
Like selling
ISIS out from under us?!

03:32.584 --> 03:35.886
That, and the round-the-world
luxury cruise I'm taking with your mom.

03:35.955 --> 03:39.022
- The what?
- Hopefully in the honeymoon suite!

03:39.090 --> 03:39.994
The what?!

03:40.114 --> 03:43.660
And then the unemployment
office, after ODIN lays us all off.

03:43.729 --> 03:44.528
Ugh!

03:44.596 --> 03:45.762
That totally stinks!

03:45.831 --> 03:47.646
Eh, you were on
borrowed time anyway.

03:47.766 --> 03:48.934
No, that!

03:49.054 --> 03:50.066
What are you eating?!

03:50.135 --> 03:51.734
Ackee and saltfish.

03:51.803 --> 03:54.604
Yeah thanks,
this is only mohair!

03:54.673 --> 03:57.501
So, you really think ODIN's
gonna get rid of everybody?

03:57.621 --> 04:01.110
No. Not everybody...
In fact, ODIN plans to promote

04:01.230 --> 04:05.582
a very select few ISIS personnel to
fill some of the impending vacancies.

04:05.650 --> 04:07.240
Vacancies like...?

04:07.360 --> 04:08.918
Malory Archer's chair.

04:08.987 --> 04:09.987
Wh-? Really?!

04:10.107 --> 04:14.105
Well figuratively, I mean I don't
know about the actual chair, but...

04:14.225 --> 04:20.648
- So I'd be like, like the...
- Regional director for the Americas.

04:20.767 --> 04:21.971
Barry, that's my dream job!

04:22.091 --> 04:23.534
Yours for the taking.

04:23.603 --> 04:25.436
If you are similarly mine.

04:25.505 --> 04:26.838
For the taking.

04:26.907 --> 04:29.741
Taking as in...
to get this job I'd have to have sex with you?

04:29.810 --> 04:31.886
Your words.

04:33.381 --> 04:35.405
And also mine. Yes.

04:37.752 --> 04:38.551
Hey! hey!

04:38.620 --> 04:41.788
Do you idiots wanna
hear my plan or not?!

04:41.857 --> 04:45.125
Okay, so... suggestions.

04:45.194 --> 04:45.993
About... what?

04:46.062 --> 04:47.145
What're we talking about?!

04:47.265 --> 04:49.706
Stopping my mother from
selling ISIS to ODIN!

04:49.826 --> 04:51.390
You said you had a plan!

04:51.510 --> 04:54.380
My plan, is to
crowdsource a plan!

04:59.337 --> 05:00.364
My ear bells!

05:00.484 --> 05:02.710
Don't you people
have work to do?!

05:02.779 --> 05:03.945
Not for long, huh?

05:04.013 --> 05:08.649
Uh, can't wait to welcome each and
every one of you into the ODIN family!

05:08.718 --> 05:13.921
And speaking of, kiddo, hope you're
gonna welcome me into your family.

05:13.989 --> 05:17.991
My fam..., uh, uh, uhrrowrrmf!

05:18.059 --> 05:19.158
Ugh!

05:19.227 --> 05:21.727
You people better not track
that onto the carpet!

05:21.795 --> 05:23.428
It's filthy enough as it is.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.359
C'mon, Len.

05:24.479 --> 05:26.598
I'll follow you
anywhere, my sweet!

05:26.667 --> 05:30.163
- Holy shitsnacks...
- Is Trexler buying ISIS

05:30.283 --> 05:31.805
just to get your mother to marry him?!

05:31.925 --> 05:35.789
- No! Yes! Look, shut up.
- That is some high-priced MILF.

05:35.909 --> 05:37.542
Hey! Shut up!

05:37.610 --> 05:40.078
And think of a way to make
Trexler not want my mother!

05:40.146 --> 05:41.779
We could give her a MILFectomy.

05:41.848 --> 05:44.918
If you say milf one more time,
I will shoot you in your eyeballs.

05:45.038 --> 05:49.409
She does have a point,
though Not the... m-i-l-f part!

05:49.529 --> 05:53.625
- But if we could make Trexler fall out of love...
- How? Trust me,

05:53.693 --> 05:55.177
you can't control a person's heart.

05:55.297 --> 05:57.130
You can with a
little thing I like to call a

05:57.250 --> 05:58.785
deep-cycle marine battery.

05:59.954 --> 06:01.265
Or LSD.

06:01.334 --> 06:02.760
Is that what
you've been giving me?!

06:04.571 --> 06:05.303
Yes?

06:05.371 --> 06:07.320
- Well that explains a lot...
- I thought those

06:07.440 --> 06:08.410
were breath strips!

06:08.530 --> 06:10.608
But anyway, whatever,
emotions like "love" don't

06:10.676 --> 06:13.185
actually come from the heart, they
The brain!

06:13.305 --> 06:14.161
Yeah.

06:16.199 --> 06:17.335
Or LSD.

06:24.257 --> 06:25.955
Oh, come on...

06:28.842 --> 06:30.724
Where is the trust?

06:34.274 --> 06:37.923
What could be so secret she
wired it up with twelve pounds of C-4?

06:38.376 --> 06:40.678
Ugh, I don't think I even wanna know...

06:43.551 --> 06:44.599
What.

06:44.719 --> 06:45.418
Nice.

06:45.487 --> 06:47.887
Here, take a look at this.

06:47.956 --> 06:50.456
Okay, which one of these wires
Blue and yellow.

06:50.525 --> 06:52.191
Ya wanna look at it
for more than half a second?

06:52.260 --> 06:54.961
I wired the damn thing!
Ass!

06:55.029 --> 06:57.535
Well I didn't know that!
Ass!

06:58.433 --> 07:01.701
- Okay...
- I lied, I didn't wire it.

07:01.770 --> 07:02.502
ARCHER What?!

07:02.570 --> 07:03.269
Badumpbump.

07:03.338 --> 07:05.505
You think that's funny?

07:05.573 --> 07:07.308
Not compared to that.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.660
What is that?
Oh yeah.

07:08.780 --> 07:12.609
No no no no no,
Ray what do I do?!

07:12.729 --> 07:15.557
- Well if you don't shut if off...
- She'll know somebody was in here!

07:15.677 --> 07:18.084
So you could wait
for the batteries to die...

07:18.153 --> 07:19.509
- Okay, yeah that's...
- But sounds like

07:19.629 --> 07:22.122
there's about four big ol'
D-cells in it.

07:22.190 --> 07:25.179
- ARCHER Aww, maaan...
- Yeah, it's... it's pretty big.

07:25.299 --> 07:26.000
Is it black?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.712
- ARCHER Wh-? No, it's...
- Slightly darker black?

07:27.832 --> 07:29.897
ARCHER No!
It's not any kind of black!

07:29.965 --> 07:31.398
- Racist.
- Shut up!

07:31.467 --> 07:34.034
It's more of a...
Aubergine?

07:34.103 --> 07:34.936
I guess you'd call that?

07:35.004 --> 07:36.037
Oh. Still pretty hot.

07:36.106 --> 07:37.038
Will you shut up?

07:37.107 --> 07:38.116
- Take a picture.
- Shut up!

07:38.414 --> 07:41.143
Okay, I'm going in.
Aww man, can't believe I'm doing this...

07:41.212 --> 07:44.080
Try to think
about something else.

07:44.149 --> 07:45.615
Like how there's no sink in there.

07:45.684 --> 07:47.918
So what if
there's no... Oh my God!

07:47.986 --> 07:48.718
Yeah.

07:48.787 --> 07:50.095
There's no sink!

07:52.858 --> 07:56.240
Ugh... there's not enough liquor
and therapy in the world to undo that.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.676
I touched my mother's dildo.

07:57.796 --> 07:59.629
You shoulda borrowed these.

07:59.697 --> 08:02.932
They're like super heavy du... aagh!

08:03.001 --> 08:03.532
Hey!

08:03.601 --> 08:04.367
What the hell're you doing?

08:04.435 --> 08:05.301
What're you doing?!

08:05.370 --> 08:06.335
Making robot birds?

08:06.404 --> 08:09.805
Lana we're in crisis mode, Mother's
trying to sell us to ODIN!

08:09.874 --> 08:10.672
I know.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.441
So how about don't break any
more stuff in my new office?

08:12.509 --> 08:15.677
Your new... oh my God,
ODIN's making you the new boss?

08:15.746 --> 08:19.848
Yup. I mean, I kinda maybe have to
sleep with Barry, but... ARCHER Wh-?!

08:19.917 --> 08:20.815
Lana, how can you do that?!

08:20.884 --> 08:23.470
By getting drunk and knowing it's
the same thing your mother's doing?

08:23.590 --> 08:27.010
And I know that it's killing you
that she's leaving you for another man,

08:27.130 --> 08:29.105
and you better not mess it up for me.

08:29.225 --> 08:31.561
Speaking of mess, you traitor,
your stupid birdbot is leaking.

08:31.630 --> 08:32.962
My what?

08:33.030 --> 08:33.530
Aw, shit!

08:33.599 --> 08:35.499
Probably hydraulic fluid.

08:35.568 --> 08:37.768
It's sweet-and-sour, dumbass!

08:37.837 --> 08:40.371
Yeah who's the
dumbass now, Lana?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.440
- Or whom...
- Barry.

08:42.509 --> 08:43.607
How's your shattered femur?

08:43.677 --> 08:48.714
How's your... creepily childlike
feeling of maternal abandonment?

08:48.783 --> 08:50.649
The sale isn't
final yet, Barry.

08:50.717 --> 08:51.683
No, but it will be.

08:51.752 --> 08:53.855
And we're here to make sure of it.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.890
So don't try to do anything stupid.

08:57.010 --> 09:00.791
I don't have to try.

09:00.859 --> 09:03.927
Shit, whatever, move.

09:03.995 --> 09:05.895
Barry, is that
how you get ants?

09:05.964 --> 09:08.798
Yes it is, Other Barry, yes it is.

09:16.562 --> 09:19.930
Okay, the satellite link is online...
So let's play God.

09:21.915 --> 09:25.551
Freaky... I'll tell
what's freaky, is guess what I had already

09:25.620 --> 09:26.452
named this bunny.

09:26.521 --> 09:27.309
Rabbert Klein.

09:28.590 --> 09:30.857
Wow, that's...
actually better.

09:30.926 --> 09:31.524
All yours.

09:31.593 --> 09:33.334
So can you put it in a person's brain?

09:36.332 --> 09:37.131
He'd suffocate.

09:37.199 --> 09:38.632
Not the rabbit, idiot!

09:38.701 --> 09:39.233
The chip!

09:39.302 --> 09:40.668
Oh! Yes, absolutely!

09:40.736 --> 09:42.216
Without killing the person?

09:42.336 --> 09:45.683
Oh. Yeah, maybe.

09:46.676 --> 09:49.077
Ahhhh...
doesn't that feel good?

09:49.146 --> 09:50.879
Feels better than this offer.

09:50.947 --> 09:53.648
Len, I need at least
twenty percent down.

09:53.717 --> 09:56.251
Aww c'mon, it's not
like you need the money.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.052
You're already loaded.

09:57.121 --> 09:59.221
What if...
I weren't?

09:59.290 --> 10:01.657
Then you'd know
I loved you for you.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.059
You really do, don't you?

10:03.128 --> 10:04.861
And always have.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.131
What about all those years you
spent shacked up with what's-her-face,

10:08.200 --> 10:08.998
the crazy one?

10:09.067 --> 10:11.668
- Anastasia...
- No, the tall brunette.

10:11.737 --> 10:12.535
Crazy-crazy.

10:12.604 --> 10:13.836
Yeah, Anastasia.

10:13.905 --> 10:14.770
She killed herself.

10:14.839 --> 10:16.583
Oh. Right, sorry.

10:19.074 --> 10:21.443
Yeah, that's
how you like it, huh?

10:21.512 --> 10:27.631
- All down in your nooks and crannies...
- So hey, hate to interrupt

10:27.751 --> 10:30.585
- your conversation...
- It wasn't a conversation Lana,

10:30.654 --> 10:34.356
I was just talking to
my gun, not with it.

10:34.424 --> 10:35.490
Pretty big difference.

10:35.559 --> 10:38.527
Huge, yeah, so, are they in there
signing the sale contract, or...?

10:38.595 --> 10:40.028
- As we speak.
- Yessss!

10:40.097 --> 10:43.531
Cause I've got tons of ideas to run this
place more efficiently once I'm ODIN's

10:43.600 --> 10:44.666
regional director.

10:44.735 --> 10:46.234
Already jotted a bunch down.

10:46.303 --> 10:48.770
Hey, that's great.

10:48.839 --> 10:54.108
Hope you bring that same kind of enthusiasm
and self-starterishness to having

10:54.177 --> 10:55.242
sex with me.

10:55.311 --> 10:55.776
Oh.

10:55.845 --> 10:58.780
- So us hooking up is still, um...
- A perquisite for the job, yeah.

10:58.848 --> 11:00.506
Or is... do I mean prerequisite?

11:00.626 --> 11:03.667
Either way, Barry's pretty stoked.

11:03.787 --> 11:07.622
Okay, so that's Barry and Lana...
Pam, you're the amorphous

11:07.691 --> 11:09.590
- rasta-blob...
- Big ups.

11:09.659 --> 11:13.193
Those are the ODIN guys,
Ray you're the little pink sailor,

11:13.262 --> 11:15.263
and... Why do you have so
many damn dolls in here?

11:15.331 --> 11:17.498
For sexual
harrassment complaints.

11:17.567 --> 11:20.701
So people can non-verbally indicate
where stuff happened on their body.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.436
Yeah that
takes like, one doll.

11:22.505 --> 11:24.304
Not if there's ever a gang rape.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.158
Cyril, better pill up.

11:27.278 --> 11:28.709
You're assisting Krieger
with the surgery.

11:28.777 --> 11:30.810
- Wh-? ! Why me?!
- You're good at math.

11:30.930 --> 11:32.380
How is that supposed to help?!

11:32.448 --> 11:32.947
Can't hurt.

11:33.016 --> 11:36.783
Ray you lure Lana into the
mainframe, Carol you lure Barry...

11:36.852 --> 11:37.751
I wanna lure Barry!

11:37.820 --> 11:39.420
Wrong bait Ray, he's straight.

11:39.488 --> 11:40.421
How do you know?

11:40.489 --> 11:42.055
How do I... he was engaged!

11:42.124 --> 11:43.475
I was married!

11:43.595 --> 11:44.958
For two years.

11:45.027 --> 11:50.841
I mean, she was a lesbian, but still...
we met in a "Pray Away the Gay" bible group.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.860
That was a pretty weird time for me.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.332
Just get Lana
in the mainframe!

11:54.510 --> 11:56.400
I'll take care of Trexler, and Pam?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.403
You're job is to neutralize
the ODIN agents.

11:58.523 --> 12:00.582
How the shit am I
s'posed to do that?!

12:00.702 --> 12:02.385
With Krieger's
magic breath strips.

12:02.505 --> 12:03.594
But do not touch them.

12:03.714 --> 12:06.142
Lysergic acid is absorbed
right through the skin.

12:06.262 --> 12:07.824
Even the tip of your fing... uh-oh.

12:07.892 --> 12:09.493
Oh for [BEEP]'s sake, Krieger!

12:09.613 --> 12:11.347
You're about to do brain surgery!

12:11.467 --> 12:13.729
Yeah, so...
sooner's gonna be better than later.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.338
Dammit, how
much time do we have?!

12:15.383 --> 12:17.137
For me, usually
about twenty minutes.

12:17.257 --> 12:18.893
- Usually?!
- Less if I take two.

12:19.013 --> 12:20.336
Man, you have got a problem.

12:20.456 --> 12:21.864
Oh right,
like you're one to talk.

12:21.984 --> 12:23.393
Yeah, Pillbo Baggins.

12:23.513 --> 12:25.705
- CYRIL These are from a doctor!
- So?!

12:25.774 --> 12:26.905
Krieger's a doctor!

12:27.025 --> 12:28.174
Not a medical doctor!

12:28.243 --> 12:30.477
Not even the other kind.
Technically.

12:30.545 --> 12:32.765
I gotta tell ya guys...

12:32.885 --> 12:36.515
Um, not feeling super-confident
bout this plan.

12:39.554 --> 12:40.954
Racist.

12:44.770 --> 12:47.410
I guess you
must be the infamous "Barry"

12:47.479 --> 12:48.945
everyone's talking about.

12:49.014 --> 12:51.014
Yeah, go away?

12:52.485 --> 12:55.820
- Infamously few of words I guess!
- Go away.

12:55.889 --> 12:58.185
Um, so Lana said to give you this?

13:00.789 --> 13:02.093
Pretty succinct.

13:02.162 --> 13:03.939
Guess you
guys have lots in common!

13:06.955 --> 13:09.771
Like, I bet your genitals are the
same distance from the ground.

13:09.891 --> 13:11.035
Look alive, gang.

13:11.104 --> 13:13.104
I think Archer's gonna try
to torpedo this deal,

13:13.173 --> 13:17.922
so until the contract is signed, don't
let Archer anywhere near that office.

13:20.015 --> 13:22.555
What're you... don't do that,
You asshole.

13:22.675 --> 13:23.971
We're buying this place.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.917
- Carpet's shitty enough as it is...
- I'll tell ya what's shitty,

13:27.985 --> 13:29.781
is somebody's breath around here.

13:29.901 --> 13:32.774
Whoa! Here, take three or four of 'em.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.611
Probably won't kill you guys, either.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.781
Cause somebody smells like they ate
the ass end out of a northbound cow.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.139
Well?

13:39.259 --> 13:40.299
What do you think?

13:40.419 --> 13:42.663
I think I'm
gonna miss you so much!

13:42.783 --> 13:44.757
Aww honey, you're
not going anywhere.

13:44.877 --> 13:46.965
Not when I'm the regional director.

13:47.085 --> 13:49.841
But are you
sure you'll get the job?

13:49.910 --> 13:53.444
Totally, yes!
I mean, I do kinda have to sleep with Barry,

13:53.513 --> 13:55.046
Oh right, he
said tell you he's in the

13:55.114 --> 13:56.224
mainframe and it's now or never.

13:56.344 --> 13:58.102
- Really?
- Used those exact words.

13:58.222 --> 14:00.719
Uck.
It all feels so... dirty.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.389
Yeah, the
carpet in there's gross.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.299
No, trading sex for this job.

14:04.419 --> 14:07.874
- I mean it's the chance of a lifetime, but...
- Honey, look at me.

14:07.994 --> 14:10.096
We all gotta do what we all gotta do.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.230
You wouldn't hate me for it?

14:12.350 --> 14:13.235
Oh, God no.

14:13.355 --> 14:17.437
But just do reverse cowgirl, because
that carpet's seriously heinous.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.286
Wow!

14:18.406 --> 14:20.239
So guess that worked, huh?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.204
Pamela cool runnins, mon.

14:22.273 --> 14:25.273
ARCHER God, would you
give it a rest, um uh...

14:26.377 --> 14:28.231
Damn, I had something for this.

14:29.688 --> 14:31.160
Blob Marley.

14:32.928 --> 14:34.870
Alright, there's my signature.

14:34.990 --> 14:37.998
- And once you countersign...
- We can set sail for romance!

14:38.118 --> 14:43.712
Mazatlan, Maui, maybe even a small
wedding on the beach in Tahiti?

14:43.832 --> 14:47.364
Yeah, about that...
Can I borrow Len for a second?

14:47.774 --> 14:48.383
Why?

14:48.503 --> 14:52.586
To... give him my blessing
in asking for your hand in marriage?

14:52.706 --> 14:54.510
Well that's just weird.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.988
No, it's beautiful!

14:57.108 --> 15:01.106
Well maybe not traditional,
but it's a damn classy move!

15:01.226 --> 15:02.599
After you, kiddo!

15:05.854 --> 15:07.150
- Barry?
- In here!

15:07.270 --> 15:10.461
Just doing some deep knee bends.

15:10.787 --> 15:12.534
Nude.
Wanted to stay loose.

15:12.654 --> 15:16.864
Yeah, so listen, about the job, and this...
I don't think I can do it.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.083
Then why'd you
send me that note?

15:18.203 --> 15:20.065
What note? What the... ?!

15:20.185 --> 15:22.725
Hey! Hey! Open this damn door!

15:22.845 --> 15:25.105
Sorry, honey!
Please don't hate me!

15:25.225 --> 15:27.100
Just doing what I gotta do...

15:27.765 --> 15:29.287
I sorta pictured more

15:29.407 --> 15:32.544
of a lounge, Morris chairs,
that kinda stuff...

15:32.664 --> 15:36.415
- ARCHER Yeah. So listen, about you and Mother...
- We're in love, kiddo.

15:36.484 --> 15:37.571
Well, maybe you're in love.

15:37.691 --> 15:39.319
She's just in need.

15:39.387 --> 15:40.494
- Of what?
- Of money!

15:40.614 --> 15:43.449
She's broke, Trexler, she lost
everything in a Ponzi scheme.

15:43.569 --> 15:46.305
- So what're you saying, she's...
- Using you!

15:46.425 --> 15:47.762
You dumb idiot!

15:50.210 --> 15:52.630
Doesn't matter.
I'm crazy about her!

15:52.750 --> 15:56.062
And if I can be there for her when she
really needs me, then all the better!

15:56.182 --> 15:57.460
I was afraid you'd say that.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.474
Why? Ow! Why...

16:00.542 --> 16:01.904
...are you doing that?!

16:02.024 --> 16:03.475
- Hello...
- What is that?!

16:03.595 --> 16:04.650
Fish paralyzer?

16:05.046 --> 16:06.012
Okay.

16:06.663 --> 16:09.394
Okay, he's out.
How's Krieger doing?

16:09.514 --> 16:11.056
Not, um, great.

16:11.297 --> 16:13.658
Yes he is, let's do this!

16:14.875 --> 16:17.970
- So, are we gonna do this or...?
- No, we're not.

16:18.090 --> 16:20.444
For a big list of reasons, at
the top of which is Archer.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.833
You're not still into that guy?

16:21.953 --> 16:25.835
No! But he's out there, somewhere
and somehow, dashing all my hopes.

16:25.904 --> 16:27.420
Look this sale
is gonna happen.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.474
So what we should do is
spread our clothes around,

16:30.542 --> 16:33.831
so our naked bodies don't
touch this carpet.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.567
Oh, for the... sweet-and-sour?

16:37.687 --> 16:39.895
Might as well start an ant farm.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.287
And what's taking those two so long?

16:42.527 --> 16:44.798
Wow.
So that didn't take long, huh?

16:44.918 --> 16:46.634
- I dunno...
- That was rhetorical.

16:46.754 --> 16:47.596
Okay, Krieger!

16:47.716 --> 16:49.227
- Yes!
- What are you doing?

16:49.296 --> 16:51.686
- What's next?!
- Uh uh uh...Okay, cue visual!

16:51.806 --> 16:54.484
Roger! Cueing visual!

16:57.904 --> 17:00.731
Awww!
There's my lovely lady love!

17:00.851 --> 17:04.714
- Okay now, uh... wow, that feels good...
- Krieger!

17:04.834 --> 17:06.597
Oh!
Commence the Modified Ludovico!

17:06.717 --> 17:08.805
Commencing the
Modified Ludovico!

17:09.983 --> 17:15.520
Aaghh!
No no no, I don't like this!

17:15.589 --> 17:18.959
Who is that... horrible woman?!

17:19.079 --> 17:21.233
That's Malory Archer.
You love her.

17:21.354 --> 17:24.277
Oh no. Oh no no no no.
Ick!

17:24.396 --> 17:27.853
- Krieger?!
- Uh, uh...commence satellite link!

17:27.973 --> 17:29.826
Commencing satellite link!

17:32.926 --> 17:34.369
So, you wouldn't
want to marry her?

17:34.489 --> 17:38.233
No, eww! No, please!
Make it stop!

17:38.894 --> 17:41.637
- Uh, uh, what do I do, what do I...
- Just hit tab!

17:41.757 --> 17:42.316
Oh.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.991
- Idiot.
- Okay, it's over.

17:45.111 --> 17:47.114
And you're sure you don't
want to marry that woman.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.948
Oh God, no!

17:49.068 --> 17:50.080
No, ya know what I want?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.497
- Tell me.
- Some of that lettuce.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.685
- Um... okay.
- Or actually all of it?

17:53.805 --> 17:57.612
And the bunny attached to it, he's attached
right, can I have the bunny and the lettuce?

17:57.732 --> 17:59.515
Uh, can we
give Lenny the rabbit?

17:59.635 --> 18:01.090
And the lettuce!

18:02.612 --> 18:04.350
Sure thing. Go to town.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.505
Yeah...
cause they're brothers.

18:07.145 --> 18:09.593
Is he always going to be
like this, cause now I feel bad.

18:10.074 --> 18:12.437
Sterling? Len?

18:12.890 --> 18:14.778
Either and or both?

18:14.898 --> 18:16.965
Where the hell are you? ! Len!!

18:17.085 --> 18:19.595
Yeah, do you know where he is?

18:19.715 --> 18:23.746
Yes, I'm just screaming his name
down the hall to celebrate that fact.

18:24.694 --> 18:26.426
- That some kinda joke?
- Is that?

18:27.753 --> 18:28.702
It's cold in here.

18:28.822 --> 18:30.067
Because she's here!

18:30.187 --> 18:33.659
The big bad lady is
here and she is cooold!

18:33.779 --> 18:35.017
Len, what's going on?!

18:35.137 --> 18:38.132
You're mean and I don't
like you and I don't want ISIS

18:38.252 --> 18:41.401
or you and all I want is this
lettuce and his brother...

18:41.521 --> 18:44.317
- Rabbert Klein...
- Rabbert Klein, so Barry, you ass,

18:44.437 --> 18:48.319
for the love of all that's green take
me and Rabbert to the lettuce store!

18:49.960 --> 18:56.694
- Sterling Malory Archer...
- Yes, Mother... I'm here for you.

18:57.175 --> 18:58.729
You did the
right thing, honey.

18:58.849 --> 19:00.442
LANA And all it cost
me was my dream job.

19:00.852 --> 19:02.069
And a broken hand.

19:02.189 --> 19:04.168
- Which kills...
- Here.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.621
- I'm good.
- Racist.

19:12.766 --> 19:14.054
Buy you a cup of coffee?

19:14.436 --> 19:15.865
Ya know, since you're broke?

19:15.985 --> 19:17.252
You meddling ass.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.319
- Sterling, I know what you did to Trexler.
- I didn't do anyth...

19:20.439 --> 19:21.168
Yes you did!

19:21.288 --> 19:23.753
Because certain "items" in my desk...

19:23.873 --> 19:25.532
Bop bop bop bop bop!
I can't hear you.

19:25.652 --> 19:27.096
- were not where I put them!
- Bop bop bop bop bop!

19:27.216 --> 19:30.894
And we never need to speak of
that sickening invasion of privacy again.

19:31.014 --> 19:33.526
Yeah, and the...
neverer the better.

19:33.646 --> 19:37.286
But since I can only assume that
Russian mind-control chip is rattling

19:37.354 --> 19:40.735
- around in Len Trexler's bald head...
- Not rattling,

19:40.784 --> 19:43.605
- Krieger stapled it...
- I had to go Plan B,

19:43.725 --> 19:46.237
and lease out three floors
in the building...

19:46.357 --> 19:48.280
And also sell the cleaners.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.908
You sold the cleaners?
To who?

19:50.028 --> 19:52.508
- Or whom...
- Wh-? ! Popeye?!

19:52.628 --> 19:53.371
Mmm-hm.

19:53.491 --> 19:55.787
And he paid upfront, in cash!

19:55.907 --> 19:59.579
Yeah not surprising, considering
the fact he's a loan-sharking pimp!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.673
Former loan-sharking pimp.

20:01.793 --> 20:02.989
I'm going legitimate.

20:03.109 --> 20:04.362
What do you know
about dry cleaning?!

20:04.482 --> 20:06.272
I know you still
owe me three grand.

20:06.392 --> 20:08.607
- Yeah and I told you...
- And I also know I got

20:08.727 --> 20:10.706
five of your hand-tailored
suits in the back.

20:10.826 --> 20:12.864
Wh-?
You're holding my suits hostage?!

20:12.984 --> 20:14.135
Collateral.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.929
Now get the
outta my cleaners.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.881
I think it's a good fit.

20:18.001 --> 20:19.679
See you tomorrow Popeye!

20:19.799 --> 20:21.048
Mm-hm.

20:21.511 --> 20:26.903
What do I know about dry cleaning...
I know I'm switching from perc to D5.

20:27.023 --> 20:28.884
Goin green up in here.
