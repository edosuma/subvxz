<i>Okay, and what a beautiful morning</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:30.596
<i>it is in downtown L.A.</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:31.925
<i>And Kim, you're here
with the traffic,</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:33.225
<i>but before we do,</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:35.334
<i>here's the big question
for our listeners.</i>

00:35.435 --> 00:37.995
<i>Fifth caller will get free tickets
to the Katy Perry concert.</i>

00:38.104 --> 00:39.401
<i>Here's the question.</i>

00:39.539 --> 00:41.871
<i>What color dress
was Kim Kardashian wearing</i>

00:41.975 --> 00:44.569
<i>at last night's award show?
Fifth caller wins.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:46.576
<i>I'd like to win them myself.</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:49.546
<i>Well, anyway, Kim,
do you have the traffic on hand?</i>

00:49.649 --> 00:51.048
<i>Yes, I do, Bill.</i>

00:51.151 --> 00:53.449
<i>And isn't the weather
looking sunny and fantastic</i>

00:53.586 --> 00:54.678
<i>for this time of year?</i>

00:54.788 --> 00:57.450
<i>There is rush hour traffic
on the 101 South,</i>

00:57.590 --> 00:59.615
<i>and there does seem to be
a fender bender,</i>

00:59.759 --> 01:01.522
<i>but everything seems a go.</i>

01:02.996 --> 01:05.191
<i>Yeah, but what is Nike offering?</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.530
Oo-oo-ooh wee!

01:08.635 --> 01:11.604
You're the best sports agent
in the world!

01:11.738 --> 01:13.729
<i>Yeah, I'm headed
to the airport right now.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:15.398
Uh huh, as we speak.

01:16.643 --> 01:17.769
Hello?

01:18.778 --> 01:21.406
Hello? Joe?

01:21.514 --> 01:22.981
Okay, I hear you now.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.276
Do what? Turn...

01:24.417 --> 01:25.748
All right, I'm on the radio now.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.413
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

01:28.521 --> 01:31.149
<i>We have breaking news
from downtown L.A.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:33.088
<i>We have several
unconfirmed reports</i>

01:33.193 --> 01:34.922
<i>that several hundred people
have vanished.</i>

01:35.028 --> 01:36.086
<i>Yes, that's right,</i>

01:36.196 --> 01:37.993
<i>have vanished
throughout the city.</i>

01:38.131 --> 01:40.099
<i>...to all known locations.</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:42.794
<i>Again, very little is known
at this moment.</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:44.767
<i>Again, we interrupt this program</i>

01:44.871 --> 01:46.498
<i>with this breaking news story.</i>

01:46.639 --> 01:49.437
<i>The city is in something
of a panic right now.</i>

01:49.542 --> 01:52.170
<i>We're getting news that massive
traffic jams are everywhere.</i>

01:52.312 --> 01:54.473
<i>The unimaginable has happened.</i>

01:54.614 --> 01:56.946
<i>Hundreds, perhaps thousands
of people have disappeared</i>

01:57.050 --> 01:58.745
<i>from the face of the Earth.</i>

02:25.311 --> 02:26.835
What's going on?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.208
I don't know,
I just heard on the news

02:28.348 --> 02:29.348
tons of people disappeared.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.509
That's what I heard, too.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.954
...just disappeared?
I'm so freaked out right now!

02:38.057 --> 02:39.718
It's the end of the world!

02:46.099 --> 02:48.567
This is ridiculous!
All four lanes are backed up.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.396
- I gotta get home!
- Emergency vehicles only!

02:57.610 --> 02:58.634
They're saying, like, millions

02:58.745 --> 03:00.576
have disappeared
across the world.

03:00.713 --> 03:01.907
I can't breathe!

03:02.048 --> 03:04.175
Look at all these stupid cars.
No one's going anywhere!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.590
There must be
some other explanation.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.056
Like what, lady?

03:16.930 --> 03:18.830
- No, no!
- What?

03:18.932 --> 03:20.399
It's worse!

03:21.601 --> 03:23.068
The Rapture happened.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.228
The Rapture?
What is that?

03:25.371 --> 03:26.838
You don't wanna know, lady.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.737
You don't wanna know.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.424
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:53.565
Sorry?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.566
Are you afraid?

03:57.437 --> 03:58.768
No.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.304
Why do you ask?

04:00.440 --> 04:02.738
The Bible, you're reading it.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.241
I always read it.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.406
What's the point?
It was written by man.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.742
Inspired by God.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.881
It's all fabrication.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.106
<i>It appears the jetliner,</i>

10:36.135 --> 10:37.932
Man, I can't believe it, bro.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.129
First round to the Chargers!

10:39.238 --> 10:40.762
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

10:40.873 --> 10:42.807
It was the last round.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.207
So, uh, how much
was that contract, man?

10:46.345 --> 10:48.142
Ah, wasn't much.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.976
Five million.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.710
Yeah.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.046
Dude, whatcha gonna do
with all the money?

10:54.186 --> 10:55.278
I dunno, man.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.151
Figured I'd get me
a nice little spread,

10:57.256 --> 10:59.156
- couple cars, two, three...
- All right, all right.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.141
- Put the bread down!
- Whoa, wait!

11:16.242 --> 11:18.710
You think you can steal from me?
I will kill you!

11:18.844 --> 11:21.506
Hold on, hold on.
What are you doing?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.377
Didn't you read the sign?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.676
We ain't selling anything.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.081
How did you get in here?

11:26.218 --> 11:28.186
Relax, relax, all right?

11:28.287 --> 11:30.755
The door was open, and no,
I didn't read the sign.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.414
The door was closed.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.716
It was open.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.418
Just put the bread
on the counter!

11:36.562 --> 11:38.359
Bread on the counter!
Back away now!

11:38.464 --> 11:41.262
Fine, fine, fine!
There it is.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.164
You don't know who I am?
I play for the Chargers.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.737
I don't like baseball.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.290
"The first angel sounded,

12:11.430 --> 12:14.024
and hell and fire followed,

12:14.133 --> 12:16.966
mingled with blood and they
were thrown to the earth.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.367
And a third of the trees
were burnt up, and all of the..."

12:19.472 --> 12:21.269
Why are you trippin'
off of this?

12:22.508 --> 12:25.068
I mean, you said God
was a loving God, right?

12:25.177 --> 12:26.804
He is.

12:26.946 --> 12:30.609
He's a loving God, and he's also
a God of judgment.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.480
He can't let evil persist.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.211
It's gonna come to an end.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.811
A resolution.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.717
When He comes and takes us up...

12:41.861 --> 12:44.091
...then it's gonna be the end.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.821
Don't be deceived.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.927
I'll take my chances.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.261
"Rochelle Greenspan."

13:21.367 --> 13:22.800
Rochelle...

13:25.171 --> 13:26.468
I know a Rochelle...

13:27.473 --> 13:28.473
Pathetic.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.806
Professor Wiseman?

13:32.211 --> 13:33.211
Rochelle.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.345
Hi.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.672
I've been thinkin'
about this thesis, and...

13:37.817 --> 13:40.012
...I'm sorry,
I-I just can't do it.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.710
I'm gonna have to
drop out of class.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.884
How disappointing.

13:46.025 --> 13:49.119
You were one of
the top students in Philosophy.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.355
What's come over you?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.362
I had an experience...

13:54.333 --> 13:56.028
...and it made me a believer.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.305
So what does your
football star husband

14:01.407 --> 14:03.170
have to say about that?

14:04.076 --> 14:06.203
He's not too happy about it.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.838
I imagine so.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.706
Well...

14:11.851 --> 14:15.651
...can you prove God exists?

14:15.754 --> 14:17.153
Yes, I can.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.457
Well...

14:20.226 --> 14:21.921
...then that
will be your thesis.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.090
Thank you, Professor.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.023
All right, Rochelle,

14:28.133 --> 14:29.600
let's see if you got
some good stuff for me.

14:29.735 --> 14:30.827
Whoa!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.240
All right.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.404
Come on.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.682
Ugh!

14:50.589 --> 14:52.250
The Bible.

14:52.391 --> 14:56.350
Of all the suitcases, I have
to get another Christian's.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.462
Ridiculous.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.860
"Tuesday...

15:05.471 --> 15:07.132
I'm stranded...

15:07.273 --> 15:08.763
...on an island...

15:09.642 --> 15:11.371
...somewhere...

15:11.477 --> 15:13.911
...in the Southern Pacific.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.076
Plane went down suddenly.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.420
I am the only survivor."

15:26.592 --> 15:27.592
Wait a minute...

15:29.128 --> 15:32.097
What happened to that woman
sitting next to me?

15:32.197 --> 15:33.323
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

15:33.465 --> 15:35.262
<i>Sorry?</i>

15:35.367 --> 15:37.426
Are you afraid?

15:38.203 --> 15:41.263
No.
Why do you ask?

15:41.373 --> 15:43.136
The Bible.
You're reading it.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.967
That doesn't make any sense.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.278
<i>Really?</i>

15:48.380 --> 15:49.779
Well then, tell me,
do you believe

15:49.882 --> 15:51.440
that Julius Caesar existed?

15:52.651 --> 15:54.414
Of course.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.453
<i>...from the cockpit again,</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.454
<i>where we're asking..</i>.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.649
Everything okay?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.417
The pilot is asking everyone

15:59.525 --> 16:01.993
to put their seat belts on
and their trays up, sir.

16:02.127 --> 16:07.258
<i>...around some buildups
and possible thunder storms</i>.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.424
You think everything's okay?

16:08.534 --> 16:09.626
<i>Flight attendants,
as soon as you can,</i>

16:09.735 --> 16:10.735
<i>please take your seats.</i>

16:10.736 --> 16:11.736
Just a little bumpy.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.671
What's going on?!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.205
I'm not sure, sir.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.276
I don't know, I'm gonna
go check with the pilot.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.867
Everyone needs to have
their seat belt fastened,

16:20.012 --> 16:21.479
and just try and stay calm.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.445
Sir, I need your seat
up in the upright position.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.346
Where is she?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.850
- Everyone needs to be in their seats.
- I have no idea!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.547
Where did she go?

16:30.689 --> 16:33.988
I don't know!
She was right here!

16:34.093 --> 16:36.323
What?
That's not possible.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.627
Ah!

16:39.732 --> 16:43.634
Oh no! Please! No!

16:43.736 --> 16:46.330
This cannot be happening!
No!

17:36.388 --> 17:37.855
Maria?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.295
Hey.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.002
Keiko...

28:44.823 --> 28:47.223
We're conducting a survey
of all men

28:47.325 --> 28:49.793
between the ages of 18 and 25.

28:49.928 --> 28:51.953
- For what?
- Military duty.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.531
You're to report to Tent Camp A
tomorrow morning.

28:54.632 --> 28:56.293
Why?
What's this for?

28:56.434 --> 29:00.097
We're recruiting all men for the conflicts
both abroad and at home.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.866
I don't understand.
Are you sure you got the right guy?

29:02.974 --> 29:06.068
It's emergency orders,
ratified by Congress.

29:06.177 --> 29:09.271
You'll find out when you
get to camp tomorrow, sir.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.245
- But...
- Stop asking questions.

29:11.349 --> 29:12.475
Show the sergeant some respect!

29:12.617 --> 29:14.050
I'm not going anywhere!

29:15.353 --> 29:16.353
Is that right?

29:17.355 --> 29:19.118
Get on your knees now!

29:19.257 --> 29:21.589
Corporal!

29:21.693 --> 29:24.287
- At ease!
- Say the word!

29:24.429 --> 29:25.657
Wait! Wait!

29:27.532 --> 29:29.557
We'll be coming back tomorrow.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.329
I suggest you be ready.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.449
I miss my wife...

29:55.560 --> 29:57.687
...the fun-loving cheerleader.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.427
What happened to you?

30:07.238 --> 30:08.671
A leaf bug.

30:08.807 --> 30:09.807
What?

30:11.376 --> 30:12.376
A leaf bug.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.936
I was sitting on a bench,
back in March,

30:16.047 --> 30:18.481
in the park,
and I saw this little bug,

30:18.583 --> 30:21.780
and he had the shape of a leaf.

30:21.886 --> 30:24.787
I mean, suddenly everything
just started to make sense

30:24.889 --> 30:26.823
to me at that point.

30:26.925 --> 30:29.485
I saw God with this huge
sense of humor.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.527
The only defense mechanism
of this little bug

30:33.665 --> 30:36.634
was the fact that he
looked like a leaf,

30:36.734 --> 30:38.565
and he had the shape of a leaf.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.232
I mean, can you imagine that?

30:42.373 --> 30:44.307
How can something like that...

30:44.409 --> 30:46.172
...come out of nothing?

30:47.579 --> 30:50.047
I mean, come on,
haven't you ever just stopped

30:50.181 --> 30:51.910
to think about things like that?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.079
No.

31:01.426 --> 31:02.552
Excuse me, miss?

31:04.295 --> 31:06.388
I'm trying to get a plane ticket
out of here.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.398
My credit card doesn't work
but I have some cash.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.435
Unfortunately, all of the flights
are completely sold out.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.162
Sold out?

31:14.272 --> 31:15.398
Come on.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.874
What about Mexico City?

31:19.611 --> 31:21.579
Guam, Peru, Tokyo...

31:21.713 --> 31:24.273
Look, the last flight
sold out nine hours ago.

31:24.415 --> 31:26.178
I'm just packing up.

31:26.284 --> 31:29.082
They're shutting down LAX
tomorrow, sir.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.881
Do you watch the news?

34:27.799 --> 34:29.197
Rika-san...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.634
Rika-san...

36:53.911 --> 36:55.344
Rika...

36:56.647 --> 36:57.705
Rika?

37:28.012 --> 37:31.038
♪ ♪

40:06.904 --> 40:10.203
<i>I'm out in the middle of nowhere</i>.

40:10.307 --> 40:12.400
<i>Our plane crashed last night.</i>

40:15.946 --> 40:17.607
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

40:17.748 --> 40:19.545
<i>Please help me, Lord.</i>

40:21.318 --> 40:23.115
<i>I don't...</i>

40:27.358 --> 40:30.885
Well, so much for your prayer,
lady.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.622
That's where it got you.

40:40.037 --> 40:43.734
Is it irrational
to believe in God?

40:43.841 --> 40:45.433
I believe it is.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.504
Mary, you disagree with me.

40:48.646 --> 40:49.738
Why?

40:49.847 --> 40:51.178
I just believe in God.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.180
Ed...

40:53.317 --> 40:54.477
I don't believe in God, sir.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.017
Good man,

40:56.153 --> 40:58.417
but you know what ticks me off?

40:58.522 --> 41:01.355
Stupid declarative sentences.

41:01.492 --> 41:04.120
Don't give me
a declarative sentence

41:04.228 --> 41:05.991
unless you can prove it.

41:07.031 --> 41:09.261
Now, Rochelle, continue.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.163
Why do you believe in God?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.997
Faith.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.502
It's the only way.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.866
I've seen answers to my prayers.

41:16.006 --> 41:18.600
Answers to your prayers?

41:19.844 --> 41:21.311
Something funny, Bill?

41:21.412 --> 41:23.312
It just sounds so stupid.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.673
It's not stupid.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.978
People can believe in prayer...

41:30.154 --> 41:31.712
...even if they're wrong.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.785
Continue, Rochelle.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.629
I remember standing
at the ocean...

41:39.730 --> 41:44.326
...and I said, "Lord, speak,
for your servant is listening."

41:44.435 --> 41:46.995
And right at that exact moment,

41:47.104 --> 41:48.969
there was this loud thunder,

41:49.073 --> 41:51.234
and the sky turned all red.

41:53.043 --> 41:56.570
I mean, that was one
self-authenticating experience.

41:58.082 --> 42:01.347
If we base the proof of God

42:01.452 --> 42:03.044
on that criteria alone,

42:03.187 --> 42:04.984
it proves God exists.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.251
How absurd.

42:08.559 --> 42:11.357
Why is it that you
are the only one

42:11.462 --> 42:15.091
who's had
this sensory experience?

42:41.258 --> 42:43.283
You piece of junk!

42:46.330 --> 42:50.357
This cannot be happening!

42:51.936 --> 42:53.904
But you don't understand.

42:54.004 --> 42:56.370
If I get an F in this course,
I won't graduate.

42:56.473 --> 42:57.473
Correct.

42:58.943 --> 43:01.571
But my grandma put all her
life savings into this tuition.

43:01.679 --> 43:04.079
That's not my problem, is it?

43:04.181 --> 43:08.083
What about your rich husband,
the pro football player?

43:08.185 --> 43:09.743
He wants a divorce.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.748
Well, you get half.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.254
No, I don't.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.124
I let him keep it all.

46:10.667 --> 46:13.135
Look, I gotta get outta the country.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.431
Any ticket will do.

46:15.539 --> 46:18.167
What do you mean, all sold out?

46:18.308 --> 46:19.570
Everywhere?

46:22.713 --> 46:24.806
<i>It's getting out of control.</i>

46:24.948 --> 46:28.008
<i>In L.A., demonstrations were
held outside Staples center,</i>

46:28.152 --> 46:30.279
<i>where a curfew is now in effect.</i>

46:30.387 --> 46:32.252
<i>No one can go out
after five p.m.</i>

46:37.728 --> 46:39.195
Got ya!

46:39.329 --> 46:41.263
There is a curfew going on.

46:41.365 --> 46:43.128
You didn't know?

46:43.233 --> 46:44.325
This ain't no third world country.

46:44.468 --> 46:46.026
I don't report...

46:46.170 --> 46:47.296
Hey, guys, look!

46:47.404 --> 46:48.428
- Hey!
- Hey!

46:48.539 --> 46:49.836
- Hey!
- What's up?

46:49.973 --> 46:51.873
Hey, buddy!

46:52.009 --> 46:54.136
What seems to be
the problem here?

46:54.244 --> 46:57.771
Did we not say to you that we
are conscripting you tomorrow?

46:57.881 --> 46:59.815
You aren't trying to run,
are you boy?

46:59.917 --> 47:01.612
I'm just trying to get
out of the country.

47:01.718 --> 47:02.844
Is that right?

47:02.986 --> 47:04.715
No one's leaving the country,
you idiot.

47:04.855 --> 47:06.117
They're shutting down
all the airports tonight.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.223
- Duh.
- Duh.

47:07.357 --> 47:08.619
Who the heck are you?

47:08.725 --> 47:10.215
I'm a cop.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.453
- Cop?
- Get him!

47:17.434 --> 47:18.696
Huh, you think you're fast?!

47:19.403 --> 47:20.870
You think that's funny?!

47:21.004 --> 47:23.165
You got some wheels on you,
huh, boy?

47:25.042 --> 47:26.042
Hmm?

47:26.043 --> 47:27.533
Who are you guys?

47:27.678 --> 47:29.908
- We're military contractors.
- That's right.

47:30.047 --> 47:31.639
You know, keepin' order.

47:31.748 --> 47:34.182
Yeah, we the new law.
New law.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.551
Y'all don't get it?

47:39.623 --> 47:41.250
It's happening!

47:41.391 --> 47:42.551
The Rapture!

47:42.693 --> 47:44.923
The Rapture?

47:45.062 --> 47:47.553
I mean, think! Think!

47:47.698 --> 47:49.359
All the people that vanished...

47:50.467 --> 47:52.367
They believed!

47:52.469 --> 47:54.164
- I believe.
- Yeah, I believe.

47:54.271 --> 47:55.533
- This guv's nuts, man.
- I believe you're in trouble.

47:55.639 --> 47:57.368
Oh, I'm a believer.

47:57.474 --> 47:58.941
I believe you're nuts.

47:59.076 --> 48:01.943
If we're doomed, I think
we best go out in style.

48:02.079 --> 48:03.273
Yeah.

48:03.413 --> 48:05.438
What is your bank account
number, my man?

48:05.582 --> 48:07.880
- Ching ching!
- What?

48:07.985 --> 48:09.577
What is your
bank account number?!

48:12.256 --> 48:14.451
None of the accounts work.

48:14.591 --> 48:17.082
I'm not gonna say this again.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.558
What is it?

48:18.662 --> 48:20.289
Citibank.

48:20.430 --> 48:22.091
- Citibank.
- Citibank, yeah.

48:22.232 --> 48:23.563
Good tellers.
Good tellers.

48:23.667 --> 48:25.259
Number.

48:25.402 --> 48:28.371
This guv is sitting on a personal fortune
of three million dollars.

48:28.472 --> 48:30.303
Ooh, baby!

48:30.440 --> 48:32.533
Payday, baby!

48:32.643 --> 48:34.304
- Wooh!
- Make money money!

48:34.411 --> 48:35.411
Wooh!

48:35.412 --> 48:37.277
Let me tell you something.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.882
You send this to my
bank account right now...

48:39.983 --> 48:41.280
...and we'll let you go.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.443
Your account?

48:43.587 --> 48:45.214
Ugh! Let me get
a piece of that, man!

48:45.322 --> 48:47.051
Shut up!

48:47.157 --> 48:48.283
I'll split this
with you guys later.

48:48.425 --> 48:49.483
What about me?

48:49.626 --> 48:50.786
What about you?

48:50.928 --> 48:52.259
Back down.

48:52.362 --> 48:53.420
Back down!

48:54.331 --> 48:55.331
Back down!

48:55.332 --> 48:56.390
You're all good here, buddy.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.933
Remember that.

49:00.671 --> 49:02.002
Now what do you say?

49:04.508 --> 49:06.499
None of the money's
gonna matter.

49:06.643 --> 49:09.510
Well then, it's not gonna matter
if you hit send, now is it?

49:09.646 --> 49:11.238
Yeah, use your pinky finger.

49:11.348 --> 49:12.610
The one you
dropped the ball with.

49:12.716 --> 49:13.910
Wooh!

49:14.484 --> 49:16.076
Come on, now.

49:20.390 --> 49:22.620
There we go.
There we go.

49:24.561 --> 49:27.428
Boys, we just made
the fastest three mil possible!

49:30.567 --> 49:31.591
Payday!

49:31.702 --> 49:33.431
Thank you very much,
Mr. Touchdown!

49:33.537 --> 49:34.595
Wooh!

49:44.548 --> 49:45.810
- Let's roll.
- Wooh!

49:46.683 --> 49:47.945
Money money.

49:48.051 --> 49:49.484
God bless you!

49:49.586 --> 49:51.850
- Wooh!
- Wooh!

49:51.989 --> 49:53.957
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

49:56.760 --> 49:58.489
I don't' want a divorce.

50:00.097 --> 50:02.463
We've already
gone through this, babe.

50:02.566 --> 50:03.692
Okay?

50:03.834 --> 50:06.462
I mean, you're lookin' fine now,

50:06.570 --> 50:08.561
you're a millionaire.

50:08.705 --> 50:10.798
Not bad for a cheerleader.

50:10.907 --> 50:12.465
Come on.

50:12.576 --> 50:14.737
I didn't marry you
for your money.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.244
I can't be
with a religious zealot.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.214
I didn't sign up for that.

50:21.351 --> 50:23.376
I'm not a zealot.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.545
I just love Jesus.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.889
Why don't you get it?

50:33.563 --> 50:34.996
Your papers are on the counter.

50:58.622 --> 50:59.748
Hi, hi,

50:59.890 --> 51:01.448
um, I'm your neighbor
from down the street.

51:01.591 --> 51:02.853
There's more of you.

51:02.959 --> 51:06.622
Um, I'm sorry, um,
can I come in?

51:06.763 --> 51:07.763
Look, I'm really busy.

51:07.798 --> 51:10.892
Please?

51:11.001 --> 51:14.596
Just-just...
Sorry, I need to sit.

51:18.675 --> 51:21.041
- Call 911.
- There is no 911.

51:52.642 --> 51:53.768
Keiko?

53:17.694 --> 53:19.059
Mark this.

53:20.764 --> 53:23.358
"There will be terrible times
in the last days.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.030
People will be
lovers of themselves..."

53:28.138 --> 53:30.003
I don't love myself.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.334
"...lovers of money..."

53:31.441 --> 53:33.705
I don't have any money.

53:33.810 --> 53:35.437
"...boastful..."

53:35.579 --> 53:38.207
Do I seem boastful?
I'm eating a loaf of bread...

53:38.315 --> 53:41.682
...from a bag.
- "...proud, abusive..."

53:41.785 --> 53:43.047
I'm not being abusive.

53:43.153 --> 53:45.018
My ex-husband was abusive,
I left him.

53:45.121 --> 53:46.611
"...disobedient to parents..."

53:46.756 --> 53:49.520
I'm not... You know,
he used to call me disobedient.

53:49.626 --> 53:50.626
"...ungrateful..."

53:50.727 --> 53:51.921
I love my parents.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.290
"...unholy..."

53:54.464 --> 53:55.726
I pray.

53:55.832 --> 53:56.832
"...without love..."

53:58.602 --> 53:59.602
"...unforgiving..."

53:59.669 --> 54:01.569
I'm full of love
and I forgive everybody.

54:01.671 --> 54:03.298
I even forgive my ex-husband.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.440
"...slanderous..."

54:05.475 --> 54:07.705
"...without self-control..."

54:07.811 --> 54:09.142
I'm not eating the whole loaf.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.541
"...brutal..."

54:11.414 --> 54:13.814
"...not lovers of the good..."

54:13.950 --> 54:15.884
I love everything good!

54:15.986 --> 54:17.749
"...treacherous..."

54:17.854 --> 54:19.947
I am very relaxed.

54:20.090 --> 54:23.821
"...lovers of pleasure,
rather than lovers of God."

54:31.601 --> 54:33.466
We all thought
we were Christian.

54:47.651 --> 54:49.846
Prove to me...

54:49.986 --> 54:51.749
...that God exists.

54:53.123 --> 54:57.287
Isn't God's existence a belief
not a science.

54:58.995 --> 55:00.929
- What's your name?
- Susan.

55:01.031 --> 55:03.591
Susan, don't come in here

55:03.700 --> 55:07.796
with a washed-up answer
like that ever again.

55:07.904 --> 55:10.372
I don't think it was
a washed-up answer.

55:10.507 --> 55:11.701
I think it's true.

55:11.841 --> 55:13.809
We can prove
the existence of God

55:13.910 --> 55:16.640
by the impossibility
of the contrary.

55:16.746 --> 55:19.874
The transcendent proof
that God exists

55:20.016 --> 55:22.382
is based on the impossibility

55:22.519 --> 55:24.987
that without Him,
nothing could be proven.

55:26.856 --> 55:31.350
Let's say that I asked this
gentleman in the back row...

55:31.494 --> 55:36.363
...to show that he can fly
by flapping his arms.

55:36.499 --> 55:39.366
That would be
a very unusual request,

55:39.502 --> 55:42.164
and it would be up to me
and to him

55:42.272 --> 55:44.900
to prove, to demonstrate,

55:45.041 --> 55:46.702
that he could fly,

55:46.843 --> 55:50.142
and if he can't demonstrate it,

55:50.246 --> 55:52.646
we don't believe
that he can fly.

55:53.883 --> 55:55.874
I believe he can fly.

55:56.019 --> 55:59.887
Whether he does or doesn't
doesn't disprove that belief.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.992
Out belief in God is not
based on some magic trick.

56:04.527 --> 56:07.690
Very eloguently spoken
for a cheerleader.

56:08.898 --> 56:12.163
John, can you prove to me
that God exists?

56:12.268 --> 56:13.701
I can't.

56:13.803 --> 56:15.236
Very well.

56:15.372 --> 56:16.862
Simon...

56:17.807 --> 56:19.434
...prove to me God exists.

56:21.111 --> 56:22.373
Uh, I have faith that God...

56:22.479 --> 56:25.107
I didn't say faith.
I said proof.

56:26.549 --> 56:29.074
Look around, uh,
the planets, the trees, stars.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.687
That's your proof of God?

56:31.788 --> 56:33.881
Uh, yeah.

56:33.990 --> 56:36.515
You've just proven
your ignorance.

56:43.633 --> 56:44.725
Of all the bloody...

57:29.179 --> 57:30.976
Listen...

57:31.114 --> 57:33.014
I'm lookin' for this cat
named Frankie.

57:33.149 --> 57:34.149
You know him?

57:34.150 --> 57:37.586
Why do you wanna find Frankie?

57:37.687 --> 57:39.018
'Cause he can tell me
how to get out of here.

57:40.657 --> 57:42.454
Why do you want to leave?

57:45.061 --> 57:46.460
Never mind.
Thanks.

57:48.064 --> 57:51.659
I know, you're trying to escape
the sentence of judgment, eh?

57:54.804 --> 57:56.704
How do you know?

57:56.840 --> 58:00.674
The look on your pathetic face
tells me all.

58:00.810 --> 58:05.042
Another lost person who-who
thought they were Christian.

58:06.883 --> 58:08.316
Right.

58:08.418 --> 58:11.876
Hey, it's gonna be
real hard escaping the U.S.

58:12.021 --> 58:14.148
You're not the only one
who wizened up and-and-and-

58:14.257 --> 58:17.522
realized that
they should have repented.

58:17.660 --> 58:21.027
Time to face the consequences,
sonny-boy.

58:21.164 --> 58:24.156
You're gonna die alone here.

58:24.267 --> 58:30.069
I can't wait to see
the 75 pound hailstone...

58:30.206 --> 58:32.367
...squishing you like a bug.

58:38.448 --> 58:40.916
Hey, hey wake up.

58:42.719 --> 58:45.711
You know nothing
about prophecy, do you?

58:45.855 --> 58:50.554
Daniel Seven says "Behold,
the fourth beast,

58:50.693 --> 58:54.390
dreadful, and terrible,
and strong, exceedingly,

58:54.531 --> 58:59.594
and it had great,
great iron teeth."

59:02.205 --> 59:05.902
We're too busy watching
<i>Saturday Night Live to even care</i>.

59:06.042 --> 59:10.604
Too busy out voting,
Democrat or Republican...

59:11.881 --> 59:16.011
Too busy listening
to Jon Stewart versus...

59:16.119 --> 59:18.087
...Bill O'Reilly.

59:19.222 --> 59:22.453
We ignored Jesus,
when He said...

59:22.592 --> 59:24.287
..."Look up...

59:25.795 --> 59:29.060
...because your redemption
draws near."

59:36.739 --> 59:37.967
Who are you?

59:42.178 --> 59:43.907
You don't recognize me?

59:45.081 --> 59:46.081
No.

59:48.985 --> 59:51.715
I'm-I-I was on TV...

59:54.023 --> 59:55.718
...preaching!

59:58.494 --> 59:59.586
Preaching...

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.895
You can't escape.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.093
Come back here.

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.728
You can't escape.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:20.916
<i>Prove to me God exists.</i>

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.644
<i>I, uh, have faith that God...</i>

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:26.619

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.693
<i>Faith.</i>

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.166
<i>It's the only way.</i>

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.032
<i>I've seen answers to my prayers.</i>

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.265
<i>Answers to your prayers?</i>

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:55.982
All right, baby.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.016

You need to send a rescue team

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.636

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.515
<i>Sir, millions have disappeared.</i>

I mean, you Christians,
you know,

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.663
it's like...

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:22.134
...thev didn't wanna prove
their dedication to Christ by doing what?

01:12:22.237 --> 01:12:24.831

Leavin' the country.

Look, I promise I'll

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:34.413
Man, you're a poser.

You tell me you didn't
see this comin'?

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:39.487
You didn't see the world
was dismantling by the second?

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:41.579
We used to have
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.850
on the walls.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.585
They took it down.
Why?

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.388
'Cause they don't wanna
offend nobody.

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:49.656
Now I'm sure they'd rather
have offended kids

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:50.857
than dead kids.

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:54.493
And the doors they would
not allow a Bible into

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:58.039
are the same doors they have
to put metal detectors around.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.734
So then they say...
"Where's God?

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.707
Where's God
in all this tragedy?"

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:07.043
Now... we're left...
to do what?

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:09.743
Wave a Christian flag at all
these little Christian outposts,

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.877
saying, "I'm sorry, Jesus.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.888
You know, you're the man.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.254
I-I-I wish I woulda known.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:20.760
Can I help you out?
Can I prove myself?"

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.057
But all the real Christians...

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:25.065
...got caught up in the Rapture.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.691
I'm not trying' to hear this
right now.

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.270

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.297
Hey, let me say something.

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.740
I will put a hole in your heart.

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.709
Don't threaten me

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:41.646

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.279

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.484
Go on.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.867
That's right, Rochelle.

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.266
We're trying to wipe
Christianity off the map,

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.963
and we've succeeded.

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.973
Give me a break.

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:43.101
You know, we're not some
political organization on campus

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.873
that you need to kick off.
All right?

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.311
We're just here evangelizing
lost tribes around the world.

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:50.442
I don't care.
We're going to shut you down.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.545
I didn't come
to argue with you, okay?

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.157
I mean, I just wanted
to let you know

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.782
the paper you filed against us

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:00.020
is preventing us from
evangelizing anywhere.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.789
Who cares?

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.297
They want to eat other humans,
let 'em eat other humans.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.798
God cares.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.136
Only morons believe in God.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.392
