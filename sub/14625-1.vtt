00:35.035 --> 00:41.338
First, state your name, age,
and the present condition of your health,

00:41.441 --> 00:43.466
and whether in your condition

00:43.576 --> 00:49.071
you could travel to attend in person
to Beaver, the court now sitting there.

00:51.284 --> 00:56.278
I am Brigham Young. I am in my 75th year.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.992
It would be a great risk
to both my health and life

01:02.095 --> 01:05.188
for me to travel to Beaver at this time.

01:05.698 --> 01:11.694
Because I am, and have been for some time,
an invalid.

01:15.308 --> 01:21.110
Second, what office,
either ecclesiastical, civil or military,

01:21.214 --> 01:24.206
did you hold in the year 1857?

01:25.618 --> 01:32.251
I was Governor of the Territory,
ex-officio Superintendent to Indian Affairs,

01:33.593 --> 01:39.031
and President of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints,

01:39.132 --> 01:42.067
in the year 1857.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.941
<i>The last time I was here,</i>
<i>I was six months old.</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:09.545
<i>They say you don't remember things</i>
<i>at that age, but I remember feelings.</i>

03:09.656 --> 03:14.491
<i>I remember the feel of wooden wagon</i>
<i>wheels bouncing over the rocky ground.</i>

03:14.594 --> 03:20.499
<i>I remember the feel of horse hooves</i>
<i>as they pounded across the meadow.</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.932
<i>I remember the feelings of love</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:26.631
<i>that flowed through everyone</i>
<i>on that wagon train.</i>

03:26.739 --> 03:29.503
<i>It felt special.</i>

03:29.609 --> 03:33.841
<i>Two different worlds met on this spot,</i>
<i>one of love, the other of hate.</i>

04:24.330 --> 04:28.460
-What is it?
-Riders. Looks like six of them.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.838
Let <i>'</i> s go see who we have.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.242
Greetings.

04:47.353 --> 04:51.881
I'm Captain Alexander Fancher,
and this is Captain John Baker.

04:55.762 --> 04:59.163
Perhaps you could tell us,
are we close to the supply station?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.524
There is no supply station.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.099
We were told there was a supply station
near here.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.331
No supply station. Best if you keep going.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.876
We need supplies,
which we will happily pay for,

05:10.977 --> 05:14.970
and a resting spot where we can graze
and water our livestock.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.708
We have nothing to sell.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.910
We passed rich fields being cultivated
all across this territory,

05:20.019 --> 05:23.352
-yet you say you have nothing to sell us.
-That <i>'</i> s right.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.425
We don <i>'</i> t have enough supplies
to get us to California.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.017
ls there a problem, Alexander?

05:29.128 --> 05:32.495
-Seems they don <i>'</i> t like strangers.
-Just making sure that you do not stop here.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.532
We <i>'</i> re willing to pay top dollar.

05:34.634 --> 05:39.162
-Money is the root of all evil.
-What about charity and mercy?

05:39.372 --> 05:42.830
Our livestock need to graze and water.
Our people need rest.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.570
You should have thought about that before.

05:48.414 --> 05:53.875
Name <i>'</i> s General Jacob Samuelson,
and these are my sons, Jonathan and Micah.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.617
Folks around here call me the Bishop
or the General.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.659
l <i>'</i> m the Bishop of the Church,
the General of the local militia,

06:00.760 --> 06:04.457
and the Mayor all rolled into one.

06:04.630 --> 06:08.589
l <i>'</i> m Captain Alexander Fancher,
one of the leaders of this wagon train.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.670
This is Captain Baker, Nancy Dunlap.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.341
Well, these people here are telling us
to move along.

06:15.441 --> 06:19.070
We were hoping to buy provisions
and water and graze our livestock.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.646
We don <i>'</i> t come begging.
We <i>'</i> re willing to pay.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.806
Not an unreasonable request.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.578
We need to show some Christian charity
here, now don <i>'</i> t we?

06:26.686 --> 06:28.620
Thank goodness.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.916
The men here sometimes get a little excited.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.891
We <i>'</i> ve had many problems with emigrants
using this trail.

06:34.994 --> 06:36.052
l <i>'</i> m sorry to hear that.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.630
So you understand,
we need to check you out

06:38.731 --> 06:42.565
before we decide whether
to help you or not.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.501
Of course. We have nothing to hide.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.770
You stay here.
My sons and l will look things over.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.158
That <i>'</i> s a fine animal you <i>'</i> re on, sir.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.787
This is One Eyed Blaze.
He <i>'</i> s my pride and joy.

07:10.897 --> 07:15.027
-Must be worth a pretty penny.
-Two thousand, that <i>'</i> s no lie.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.826
Now, what fool would pay so much
for a horse?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.338
A breeding or a gaming man, sir.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.448
You interested in horses, son?

07:32.552 --> 07:36.044
We have the best horses
west of the Mississippi with us.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.693
Well, there <i>'</i> s nothing here
that looks menacing.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.564
You all seem to be good Christian men
and women.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.001
Thank you, Bishop.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.073
Does this mean you <i>'</i> ll let us stay here
and rest awhile?

09:01.173 --> 09:03.903
First, let me ask where you people are from.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.810
Most of us are from Arkansas,
some of us are from Missouri.

09:08.347 --> 09:09.678
Missouri?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.452
Our people need rest, Bishop.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.454
We <i>'</i> ll pay double
with American Gold Eagles.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.950
No, of course not.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.052
-One should not pay for what God provides.
-Thank you.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.597
My men will direct you to a place
not very far from here

09:26.699 --> 09:29.361
where you can camp
for no more than two weeks.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.095
You <i>'</i> ll be safe from the hostile lndians there.

09:31.203 --> 09:34.502
-Thank you. Thank you very much, Bishop.
-Good day.

09:42.214 --> 09:46.048
Did you see those horses?
Weren <i>'</i> t they something?

09:46.519 --> 09:49.215
l <i>'</i> ve never seen horses like that before.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.521
Two thousand dollars for a horse!

09:53.759 --> 09:56.353
A man could have a mansion
with that kind of money!

09:56.462 --> 10:00.728
Those horses are going to be used
for gambling. Gambling is a sin.

10:03.402 --> 10:06.701
Some of them come from Missouri
and Arkansas.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.208
l want you to keep an eye on the emigrants.

10:10.309 --> 10:12.368
We need to find out more about them.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.843
-We will.
-Yes, Father.

10:13.946 --> 10:18.474
l want to know every detail.
There <i>'</i> s no telling what could be important.

10:21.387 --> 10:25.881
<i>''</i> The woman shall not wear
that which pertaineth unto a man.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.689
<i>''</i> All that do so are abomination
unto the Lord thy God.<i>''</i>

10:40.539 --> 10:42.973
Put the horses and wagon away.

10:45.645 --> 10:50.947
Dinner is in exactly one hour. Don <i>'</i> t be late.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.116
Micah, l expect you and your new wives
to be on time. No excuses.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.655
-Yes, sir.
-You spend too much time with them.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.783
The Prophet recommends that every man
should have at least three wives.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.724
Maybe you should take another one.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.659
What are you smiling at?

11:05.564 --> 11:10.263
-You don <i>'</i> t even have a single wife yet.
-He <i>'</i> s particular.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.163
Too particular if you ask me.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.533
Here, let me take her.

11:55.181 --> 11:58.207
Emily, you <i>'</i> ve been a godsend
since my Jenny died.

11:59.118 --> 12:03.077
Well, you know,
we <i>'</i> ve all got to help one another, Robert.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.455
You know, the baby needs a mother.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.554
Let us give thanks to the Lord.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.260
We thank you for the food we eat,

12:16.368 --> 12:20.099
the shelter that keeps us dry,
the clothes that keep us warm.

12:20.206 --> 12:24.108
Thank you for this beautiful place
for us to rest,

12:24.210 --> 12:26.576
and for the animals to feed and drink.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.477
We thank you for delivering
the Gentiles into our hands.

12:29.582 --> 12:34.246
Bless the Bishop and his family
for allowing us to stay.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.878
Surely these people are cursed
beyond hope of redemption.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.423
Thank you for showing
the light of Christian charity

12:39.525 --> 12:44.827
to those who doubted our motives
for staying in this glorious place.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.457
Cursed are the Gentile dogs
who allow abominations

12:48.567 --> 12:51.559
like that woman in pants who carries a gun.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.298
Curse all the people from Missouri
who drove us from our land

12:54.406 --> 12:55.634
...in Jesus <i>'</i> name.

12:55.741 --> 12:59.700
May these children of Satan go to hell!
Amen.

13:23.903 --> 13:27.703
<i>''</i> As he rode along, he wondered what
he would do if he came face to face.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.669
<i>''</i> He had a lot of things...<i>''</i>

13:30.776 --> 13:33.074
A word with you, Captain Fancher?

13:33.179 --> 13:35.170
ln private, if you please.

13:42.721 --> 13:46.350
-How long do you plan to stay here?
-The Bishop has allowed us two weeks.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.982
Two weeks?

13:48.093 --> 13:50.061
We need that time for our people to rest,

13:50.162 --> 13:52.653
the animals to get their bellies full,
their strength back.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.967
l have a bad feeling about this place.

13:57.069 --> 14:01.165
lt isn <i>'</i> t safe. And l think
we should move on as soon as possible.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.332
The Bishop himself said we <i>'</i> d be safe here.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.376
l know, but l don <i>'</i> t like it.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.944
l have children that depend upon me.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.571
As do l.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.878
l can <i>'</i> t help it.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.019
Since Lorenzo got sick,

14:17.256 --> 14:19.224
l just worry all the time.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.760
My children have only me to depend upon.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.855
Nancy, you <i>'</i> re not alone. You <i>'</i> ve got
an entire wagon train here with you.

14:28.634 --> 14:33.196
Now, the Bishop seems to have
an understanding with the lndians, and...

14:33.472 --> 14:35.463
Well, l believe we <i>'</i> re safe here.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.247
lt <i>'</i> s not the lndians l worry about.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.322
How long will you be gone, Father?

14:55.427 --> 14:59.124
Two days. Jonathan, you <i>'</i> re the eldest.
You <i>'</i> ll be responsible.

14:59.298 --> 15:00.322
Yes, sir.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.990
Are you sure you don <i>'</i> t want me
to go with you?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.159
l <i>'</i> m sure.

15:03.269 --> 15:07.365
Would you like me to do as you suggested
and check up on the emigrants?

15:07.473 --> 15:10.067
You <i>'</i> re awfully eager
to follow my suggestions.

15:10.175 --> 15:13.042
l <i>'</i> d like to get another look at the horses.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.976
Are you sure that <i>'</i> s all you want to
get a look at?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.174
Watch them closely.
l want to know what they <i>'</i> re up to.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.377
What would you like me to do?

15:21.787 --> 15:23.584
You watch your brother.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.721
-What are you doing?
-Watching you.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.666
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

16:14.773 --> 16:18.174
-You <i>'</i> re the Bishop <i>'</i> s son.
-Yes, sir, l <i>'</i> m Jonathan.

16:18.277 --> 16:22.077
-Beautiful day.
-Yes, sir. Sure.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.547
-Are you out for a morning ride, are you?
-No, sir.

16:24.650 --> 16:29.553
The truth is,
l was admiring your horses yesterday,

16:29.655 --> 16:35.753
and l was hoping to get a closer look
at them, if that <i>'</i> s okay by you.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.659
Well, let <i>'</i> s ride on down
and get you that closer look.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.494
l <i>'</i> m always proud to show off our horses.

16:44.703 --> 16:47.433
-You like horses, do you?
-Yes, sir.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.803
lt seems l have a way with them.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.006
-These are all mares?
-Brood mares.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.275
Most of them are due in the spring.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.682
When we get to California,
we should have a fine crop of babies.

17:00.786 --> 17:05.280
-l <i>'</i> ve never seen horses like this before.
-And you probably never will.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.723
These horses are Kentucky <i>'</i> s finest.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.624
We plan to start horse racing
when we get to California.

17:10.729 --> 17:15.632
Give those miners something to do
besides drinking and whoring.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.441
Why is that horse tied away
from the others?

17:23.541 --> 17:26.670
He <i>'</i> s mean, unmanageable,
doesn <i>'</i> t like anybody.

17:26.811 --> 17:29.542
l heard he was kept in a stall
for a whole year and never let out

17:29.648 --> 17:32.344
while his owners tried to decide
what to do with him.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.581
-Are you planning on racing him?
-No, no, he <i>'</i> s unridable.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.957
Then why do you keep him?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.552
For breeding.
He <i>'</i> ll make a great sire, one day.

17:44.663 --> 17:48.759
He <i>'</i> s got the finest bloodlines,
and he runs like the wind.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.174
l <i>'</i> m telling you,

20:14.279 --> 20:17.248
l swear my brother knows
how to talk to horses.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.878
Very impressive.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.325
Ma <i>'</i> am. Begging your pardon.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.693
That was quite impressive, Mr. Samuelson.

20:33.865 --> 20:40.600
-Jonathan. My name is Jonathan.
-Emily. l <i>'</i> m Emily.

20:41.473 --> 20:45.705
l saw you on the first day.
l was riding in my father <i>'</i> s carriage.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.438
l remember.

20:47.546 --> 20:52.313
And l <i>'</i> m Micah. Mr. Talkative <i>'</i> s brother.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.051
Nice to meet you, Micah.

20:56.255 --> 21:01.215
-So, do all animals like you?
-Most, l guess.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.354
Perhaps you <i>'</i> d like to try and ride him?

21:11.236 --> 21:13.568
He <i>'</i> s magnificent.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.873
Captain Fancher, why don <i>'</i> t you let
Jonathan try to ride him?

21:16.975 --> 21:19.307
l would say that <i>'</i> s Jonathan <i>'</i> s decision.

21:19.411 --> 21:23.074
l <i>'</i> ll warn you though,
he <i>'</i> s thrown every rider that <i>'</i> s tried.

21:23.582 --> 21:29.043
-Mr. Samuelson?
-Jonathan. Please, call me Jonathan.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.552
-Jonathan.
-l <i>'</i> ll need a corral.

21:31.657 --> 21:35.559
A one without corners
so he won <i>'</i> t feel confined.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.056
l think we can provide that.

21:39.464 --> 21:43.230
Come back tomorrow in the morning,
you can have a go at him.

22:03.255 --> 22:07.851
We are earnestly seeking to expose
the vicious principles of Joseph Smith

22:07.959 --> 22:12.225
and those who practice
the same abominations and whoredoms.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.322
Joseph Smith has ordered us
to destroy everything.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.764
He is the voice of God.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.530
Burn the papers. Burn the papers.
Burn everything.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.807
We will trample down our enemies

22:22.908 --> 22:27.242
and make it one gore of blood from
the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.179
l will be to this generation
a second Mohammed,

22:30.282 --> 22:34.378
whose motto in treating for peace
was <i>''</i> The Al-Qur <i>'</i> an or the sword.<i>''</i>

22:34.486 --> 22:39.355
So shall it eventually be with us,
Joseph Smith or the sword!

22:43.829 --> 22:48.198
Burn. Let their lies burn.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.802
Why does Joseph Smith need protection?

22:57.909 --> 23:01.072
You <i>'</i> re supposed to be a general, or a king?

23:01.179 --> 23:04.637
-l heard you got 40 wives.
-King Smith!

23:05.751 --> 23:08.481
l told you that Joseph Smith meant trouble.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.214
lt <i>'</i> s probably those Missourians.
They hate him.

23:14.993 --> 23:18.656
There must be 100 people down there.
We gotta get back downstairs. You stay put.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.494
We will never leave you or forsake you.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.603
Brother Hyrum!

23:36.748 --> 23:41.651
Joseph Smith is dead!
Joseph Smith is dead!

24:27.065 --> 24:28.657
Here he comes.

24:29.334 --> 24:33.737
-Mr. Samuelson, good morning.
-Good morning, Captain Fancher.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.103
-What have you done to him?
-He <i>'</i> s ready to go if you are.

24:41.379 --> 24:43.347
Now, l <i>'</i> ll hold him while you mount.

24:43.448 --> 24:46.144
You let me know when you <i>'</i> re ready,
l <i>'</i> ll pull that blindfold.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.913
That won <i>'</i> t be necessary.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.801
Okay.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.865
lt <i>'</i> s okay. lt <i>'</i> s okay.

25:12.010 --> 25:17.607
lt <i>'</i> s okay. Steady. Easy boy. lt <i>'</i> s okay.

25:18.283 --> 25:19.250
Okay.

25:19.985 --> 25:24.820
Here you go, pal. lt <i>'</i> s okay. lt <i>'</i> s okay.

25:39.304 --> 25:42.000
Good boy, good boy. That <i>'</i> s it. Come on.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.545
You listen to me now.

26:14.339 --> 26:17.365
Now, you <i>'</i> re listening to me now.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.984
Come on, good boy. That <i>'</i> s it. Come on.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.254
We <i>'</i> re gonna be a good team.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.020
l think that boy does speak horse.

26:43.868 --> 26:47.167
Good boy. Good boy.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.979
Good boy.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.256
Good boy.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.629
Good morning, Jonathan.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.994
Here we go. l <i>'</i> m gonna get up on you now.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.066
Good boy.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.474
That <i>'</i> s it, good boy.

27:58.910 --> 28:03.313
Okay, you ready? Here we go.

28:04.282 --> 28:07.376
lt <i>'</i> s okay. We <i>'</i> re still partners.

28:08.153 --> 28:11.145
Okay. Here we go.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.986
Good boy.

28:20.632 --> 28:25.365
Good boy. There you go.
Hey, we <i>'</i> re buddies.

29:17.655 --> 29:21.648
Joseph Smith himself ordered
a company of Danites

29:21.760 --> 29:25.753
to put right physically
that which is not right,

29:25.864 --> 29:30.665
and to cleanse the Church
of very great evils.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.897
l have no wife whom l love so well

29:34.005 --> 29:38.465
that l would not put a javelin
through her heart for lying with my brother,

29:38.576 --> 29:41.010
and l would do so with clean hands.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.245
There are sins that men commit

29:48.353 --> 29:51.379
for which they cannot attain forgiveness
in this world,

29:52.690 --> 29:54.783
or in that which is to come.

29:54.893 --> 29:58.454
And if their eyes were open
to their true condition,

29:58.563 --> 30:02.465
they would be perfectly willing
to have their blood spilt upon the ground

30:02.567 --> 30:04.558
<i>to atone for their sins.</i>

30:04.669 --> 30:09.038
lf there is a person here
that has committed a sin

30:09.140 --> 30:14.077
that he knows will deprive him of that
exaltation which he desires,

30:14.612 --> 30:18.548
and he cannot attain to it
without the shedding of his blood

30:18.650 --> 30:22.848
to atone for that sin,
and be saved and exalted with the gods,

30:22.954 --> 30:24.387
they would say,

30:24.489 --> 30:27.754
<i>''</i> Shed my blood that l may be saved

30:28.092 --> 30:30.583
<i>''</i> and exalted with the gods!<i>''</i>

30:52.217 --> 30:54.378
You <i>'</i> ve done wonders with him.

30:56.354 --> 31:00.256
Good boy. No, he does most of the work.
l just hang on.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.054
You two look like
you <i>'</i> ve been together forever.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.524
You have a beautiful baby.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.936
Thank you, but she isn <i>'</i> t mine.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.097
Her mother died at childbirth.

31:16.207 --> 31:20.234
So, l <i>'</i> m just helping the other women
and Robert take care of her.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.811
And she <i>'</i> s doing a wonderful job of it.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.642
l couldn <i>'</i> t survive without her.

31:29.654 --> 31:33.784
Can you believe what Jonathan has been
able to do with the stallion?

31:34.425 --> 31:36.017
lt <i>'</i> s impressive.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.785
But l <i>'</i> d like to see what happens when

31:38.897 --> 31:42.298
you take him outside
the confines of this little corral.

32:11.262 --> 32:14.390
President Buchanan has sent
thousands of troops

32:14.499 --> 32:18.799
which are on their way here
to kill all the lndians and all the Mormons.

32:18.903 --> 32:20.837
-lt <i>'</i> s outrageous.
-Outrageous.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.272
President Buchanan means
to remove me as Governor

32:24.375 --> 32:26.434
and give the kingdom to the Mericats.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.674
l will try to take care of number one,

32:32.784 --> 32:35.378
and if it is wicked for me
to try to preserve myself,

32:35.486 --> 32:40.355
l shall persist in it,
for I am intending to take care of myself.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.090
Hell cannot remove me.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.661
-Amen.
-Amen.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.458
-I am still your Governor.
-Glory to God!

32:47.565 --> 32:53.265
l will still rule this people until God himself
permits another to take my place.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.861
Hallelujah!

32:54.973 --> 32:57.373
l <i>'</i> m declaring martial law.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.309
We will not be run out.
This time, we will stand and fight.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.874
I am the voice of God,

33:08.319 --> 33:11.117
and anyone who doesn <i>'</i> t like it
will be hewn down.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.819
God has revealed to me

33:15.927 --> 33:18.395
that l have the right and the power

33:18.496 --> 33:22.432
to call down curses on anyone
who tries to invade our lands.

33:22.533 --> 33:27.937
-Therefore, l curse the Gentiles.
-Amen.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.569
You like him?

33:33.678 --> 33:37.307
He <i>'</i> s a beautiful horse.
With the right handling,

33:37.415 --> 33:38.507
he <i>'</i> ll be a great horse.

33:38.616 --> 33:42.780
l <i>'</i> m glad you think so,
because he <i>'</i> s yours to keep.

33:46.257 --> 33:48.657
l can <i>'</i> t accept such a gift.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.285
Boy, that horse belongs to you.

33:51.396 --> 33:54.627
He was yours the moment you laid eyes
on each other.

33:54.899 --> 34:00.303
And it wouldn <i>'</i> t be fair for me to stop
love at first sight, now would it?

34:00.571 --> 34:03.768
Thank you, sir. You <i>'</i> re very generous.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.435
No more generous than your father
has been to us.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.438
Thank you, sir.

34:10.547 --> 34:14.109
-Thank you very much.
-You <i>'</i> re most welcome.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.886
l don <i>'</i> t know how to accept such a fine gift.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.018
Well, l think, as the Captain said,

34:25.129 --> 34:28.428
l think he was yours the moment
you laid eyes on each other.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.194
Love at first sight.

34:31.668 --> 34:33.500
Do you believe in that?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.737
l don <i>'</i> t know.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.601
lt happened to my parents.

34:40.812 --> 34:45.010
My mother always likes to say it was
God <i>'</i> s plan for their lives,

34:45.116 --> 34:51.179
that it was their destiny to be together.
Do you believe in destiny?

34:52.290 --> 34:55.748
You <i>'</i> re different. l mean,
l <i>'</i> ve never met anyone like you before.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.725
You haven <i>'</i> t?

34:58.229 --> 35:01.130
A lot of people say it <i>'</i> s because
l <i>'</i> m a pastor <i>'</i> s daughter,

35:01.265 --> 35:05.258
which... l really don <i>'</i> t like it.
lt makes me feel like a misfit.

35:05.403 --> 35:08.895
l <i>'</i> ve never really been around
Gentiles before.

35:09.006 --> 35:12.806
Gentiles? What do you mean by that?
You <i>'</i> re not Jewish.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.179
lt <i>'</i> s just what we call you people.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.010
You people?
What do you mean by you people?

35:20.718 --> 35:24.381
lt <i>'</i> s just a manner of speaking.

35:24.489 --> 35:29.756
You know, different parts of the country
have different ways of saying things.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.328
You know?

35:31.896 --> 35:34.490
l suppose, Biblically speaking,
you <i>'</i> re correct.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.658
But then that would make you a Gentile, too.

35:36.767 --> 35:40.635
Actually, l like that you <i>'</i> re different
from the other girls around here.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.335
How am l different?

35:46.010 --> 35:47.272
Well,

35:49.580 --> 35:54.142
for a start, you <i>'</i> re the prettiest girl
l <i>'</i> ve ever seen.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.758
Well, l like that.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.349
And you speak your mind.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.827
You <i>'</i> re not afraid to tell people
what you think.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.694
Why is that different? A lot of the women
around here speak their mind.

36:08.799 --> 36:12.860
l mean, look at Nancy.
She <i>'</i> s much more outspoken than I am.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.666
You mean the woman who wears the pants
and carries the gun?

36:15.773 --> 36:19.937
-Yes.
-My father thinks she <i>'</i> s an abomination.

36:20.745 --> 36:22.042
Does he?

36:23.147 --> 36:25.877
He <i>'</i> s not different from
the rest of the men around here.

36:26.484 --> 36:32.218
And l don <i>'</i> t see other women in the
wagon train wearing pants or carrying guns.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.813
l mean, so what do they think about her?

36:33.925 --> 36:36.826
lt <i>'</i> s a free country.
She can do what she pleases.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.523
Why would your father care about
something like that?

36:40.631 --> 36:42.758
What difference does it make to him?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.562
lt <i>'</i> s just the way he is.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.762
A lot of things bother him.

36:54.912 --> 36:58.712
<i>''</i> Why look at the mote in your brother <i>'</i> s eye
when there is a beam in yours? <i>''</i>

37:00.284 --> 37:03.253
-What?
-Jesus said that in Matthew.

37:04.088 --> 37:06.181
lt sounds as though your father is always

37:06.290 --> 37:09.225
looking for the motes
in other people <i>'</i> s eyes.

37:11.329 --> 37:16.858
He <i>'</i> s the Bishop. l mean, it <i>'</i> s his job.
He has to keep people in line.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.067
What does your father do?

37:20.171 --> 37:25.074
My father says,
<i>''</i> Judge not, lest ye be judged.<i>''</i>

37:25.243 --> 37:27.211
Jesus said that, too.

37:29.680 --> 37:34.083
How does he keep control?
How does he punish the sinners?

37:34.185 --> 37:39.487
He doesn <i>'</i> t punish sinners.
Their sins are between them and God.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.394
Will l see you again?

37:50.201 --> 37:52.761
Even if the sun doesn <i>'</i> t rise.

38:04.815 --> 38:09.775
A wagon train from Missouri and Arkansas
is camped at the Mountain Meadows.

38:09.887 --> 38:12.447
They have 500 head of prize beef,

38:12.556 --> 38:15.787
a choice herd of Kentucky racehorses,
Kentucky muzzleloaders,

38:15.893 --> 38:18.123
a large stockpile of ammunition

38:18.229 --> 38:22.598
and a well-guarded wagon
with a trunk that is said to be full of gold.

38:24.335 --> 38:27.361
l hear some of them are Missouri wildcats

38:27.471 --> 38:30.668
who brag about killing Joseph Smith

38:30.775 --> 38:33.608
and carry the very gun that killed him.

38:33.711 --> 38:39.149
They say that they will join the army
and kill Brigham Young, all the apostles,

38:39.250 --> 38:42.515
and every damned Mormon man,
woman and child.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.249
They have no pass
to go through our country.

38:47.358 --> 38:50.953
No man has the right to go through
our lands without a pass.

38:51.896 --> 38:55.127
They could be killed as common enemies.

38:55.266 --> 38:58.133
The Paiutes and the brethren
must stick together

38:58.235 --> 39:00.999
for the Mericats plan to kill us all.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.437
We have led the Mericats
to the Mountain Meadows.

39:03.541 --> 39:06.874
lt <i>'</i> s the perfect place for an ambush
and a siege.

39:06.977 --> 39:10.845
A crown of celestial glory and eternal joy

39:10.948 --> 39:14.645
is the reward of those who are faithful
and willingly obey.

39:15.953 --> 39:19.582
We are gathered here to build up
the kingdom of God.

39:19.690 --> 39:25.424
lt exalts God that he has planted this people
in a place that <i>'</i> s not desired by the wicked.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.391
Until this moment,
l have protected emigrants

39:29.500 --> 39:31.730
who have passed through this territory,

39:31.836 --> 39:33.497
but now...

39:33.604 --> 39:36.334
Now l will loose the lndians upon them!

39:36.474 --> 39:42.208
And if any miserable scoundrel
comes here to our Zion, cut his throat.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.813
We take a solemn oath to never discuss this,

39:47.918 --> 39:49.681
even among ourselves,

39:50.821 --> 39:54.780
and promise to keep the whole matter secret
from every human being.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.493
-Amen.
-Amen.

40:00.264 --> 40:03.927
<i>''</i> Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous.

40:04.034 --> 40:08.471
<i>''</i> Praise is comely for the upright.
Praise the Lord with heart.<i>''</i>

40:13.377 --> 40:15.572
You should be careful, Emily.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.148
These people are different.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.878
l find him interesting.

40:23.621 --> 40:24.588
l know.

40:26.690 --> 40:30.285
-Where are you going?
-To the river to bathe.

40:30.394 --> 40:34.421
-ls that safe?
-Safer then one more day with the smell.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.227
Good night.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.699
Emily.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.671
No good will come of this.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.574
Seems like a lot of people
have opinions about things

40:50.681 --> 40:52.080
which are none of their business, Robert.

40:52.183 --> 40:56.847
We <i>'</i> re leaving in a week
and your heart will still be here.

40:57.221 --> 41:00.281
Well, maybe l will stay with my heart.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.487
And be one of his many wives?

41:07.598 --> 41:10.328
At least you <i>'</i> ll have help with the dishes.

41:32.556 --> 41:36.890
Easy, boy. What is it? What are you seeing?

41:38.629 --> 41:40.529
Something out there?

42:51.502 --> 42:55.302
-What are you doing here?
-Spying on you.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.440
Boy, can he run!

42:57.541 --> 43:00.442
l <i>'</i> ve got Father <i>'</i> s best horse here
and he can <i>'</i> t even keep up.

43:00.544 --> 43:02.205
Promise me you <i>'</i> ll let him
sire some stock for me.

43:02.313 --> 43:04.440
Why are you spying on me?

43:05.482 --> 43:08.280
Well, Father is a little worried about you.

43:08.385 --> 43:10.649
He thinks you <i>'</i> re getting a little too friendly
with the Gentiles.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.483
And what do you think?

43:13.924 --> 43:17.325
-You need a wife.
-l <i>'</i> m getting tired of hearing that.

43:17.695 --> 43:21.995
Let me tell you, there <i>'</i> s nothing like
a soft body to cuddle up with at night.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.657
l don <i>'</i> t want to hear about that.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.235
-You like that Gentile girl?
-Why?

43:26.337 --> 43:29.864
She sure is pretty. You think she <i>'</i> ll convert?

43:30.608 --> 43:34.567
-Maybe l will.
-Now you <i>'</i> re just being stupid.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.939
You <i>'</i> re the man.
She <i>'</i> s the one who needs to convert.

43:39.316 --> 43:41.910
Micah, do you love your wives?

43:42.920 --> 43:45.889
l don <i>'</i> t know. l mean, what <i>'</i> s love?

43:46.790 --> 43:48.985
Maybe men don <i>'</i> t fall in love,
only women do.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.823
-You ever thought about that?
-No.

43:53.097 --> 43:54.758
You need a wife.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.444
-Here you go.
-Where are you going?

44:12.583 --> 44:16.041
Home, to bed, with my wives.

44:16.854 --> 44:19.049
Well, be careful
you don <i>'</i> t go falling in love, okay?

44:19.189 --> 44:21.783
lt <i>'</i> s okay. At least l <i>'</i> m married.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.655
Oh, you want me to put your horse away
for you?

44:25.763 --> 44:29.426
No, l <i>'</i> ll do it.
l want to talk to father when he gets home.

44:57.995 --> 44:59.986
Fine-looking horse.

45:01.331 --> 45:03.492
Yes, he is, Father.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.859
Where did he come from?

45:07.471 --> 45:10.702
He was a gift to me.

45:12.209 --> 45:15.269
Who would give you such a fine gift
and why?

45:17.915 --> 45:21.316
Well, the truth is,
no one else could go near him.

45:22.586 --> 45:24.554
So they gave him to me.

45:27.658 --> 45:29.250
He <i>'</i> ll make a great sire.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.260
He <i>'</i> ll definitely improve
the quality of our stock.

45:32.362 --> 45:35.422
-Yes.
-What <i>'</i> s happening with the emigrants?

45:35.532 --> 45:38.126
When do they plan to move out?

45:38.936 --> 45:41.962
l think they plan to stay the two weeks
that you gave them.

45:42.072 --> 45:45.200
Have they said anything about
the Prophet <i>'</i> s murder?

45:46.810 --> 45:51.247
l don <i>'</i> t think they even know
who Joseph Smith was.

45:51.415 --> 45:56.182
Have you heard them talk about joining
Buchanan <i>'</i> s army, running us out of here?

45:56.320 --> 45:59.551
All they want to do is go to California.

46:00.824 --> 46:04.351
l think you <i>'</i> ve got them figured wrong.
They mean no harm.

46:04.661 --> 46:09.655
Some of them are from Missouri.
Can <i>'</i> t trust anyone from Missouri.

46:09.833 --> 46:14.236
That <i>'</i> s like saying every Mormon
is perfect and can do no wrong.

46:17.174 --> 46:20.268
You <i>'</i> re not getting attached
to the emigrants, are you?

46:20.377 --> 46:22.038
What do you mean?

46:25.516 --> 46:28.644
l notice those emigrant girls
had an eye for you.

46:29.319 --> 46:32.288
l <i>'</i> ve been thinking,
the Taylor girl is awful pretty.

46:32.389 --> 46:36.018
-lt <i>'</i> s time you took a wife.
-l don <i>'</i> t want one right now.

46:36.727 --> 46:39.218
Gwen Taylor is sweet on Donald.

46:39.329 --> 46:43.356
l <i>'</i> m the Bishop around here.
You can have any girl you want as a wife.

46:44.768 --> 46:47.464
l <i>'</i> m not interested in her, Father.

46:48.338 --> 46:50.966
l don <i>'</i> t want someone to marry me
just because you <i>'</i> re the Bishop.

46:51.074 --> 46:52.371
Why not?

46:55.379 --> 46:58.280
You have your mother <i>'</i> s looks, my position.

46:58.382 --> 47:01.408
Any girl would be proud to be sealed to you.

47:05.189 --> 47:06.986
She was beautiful.

47:09.393 --> 47:12.089
At least, that <i>'</i> s how l remember her.

47:14.364 --> 47:16.889
ls that how you remember her?

47:20.904 --> 47:24.567
She was considered the most beautiful
woman in these parts.

47:28.278 --> 47:30.075
What happened to my mother?

47:30.180 --> 47:33.081
After all these years, what does it matter?

47:33.183 --> 47:34.616
lt matters to me.

47:34.718 --> 47:37.915
The Apostle took her away.
l want to know why.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.353
He had a revelation that she was
supposed to be his wife.

47:40.457 --> 47:42.516
And you believed him?

47:43.327 --> 47:46.387
She already had a family and a husband.

47:46.496 --> 47:48.828
She was sealed to you in the Church.

47:48.932 --> 47:51.628
As the Apostle Heber says,
<i>''</i> Learn to do as you are told.

47:51.735 --> 47:55.330
<i>''</i> lf you are told by your leaders
to do a thing, do it.

47:55.439 --> 47:57.430
<i>''</i> lt <i>'</i> s none of your business
whether it be right or wrong.<i>''</i>

47:57.541 --> 48:00.339
lt <i>'</i> s wrong to take a mother
from her children,

48:00.444 --> 48:02.912
a wife from her husband.

48:05.582 --> 48:07.516
No one can do that.

48:08.252 --> 48:09.810
There are many things
that we don <i>'</i> t understand,

48:09.920 --> 48:13.253
because we don <i>'</i> t have
direct revelations from God.

48:14.992 --> 48:17.859
You didn <i>'</i> t even argue with him, did you?

48:17.961 --> 48:21.488
He was one of the Apostles.
l had no right to argue with him.

48:23.033 --> 48:24.591
She knew.

48:28.171 --> 48:31.698
She saw through the lie
and came back for us.

48:34.177 --> 48:37.476
-Jonathan.
-She was willing to die for us.

48:44.788 --> 48:46.221
You were there.

48:46.323 --> 48:47.517
What are you talking about?

48:47.624 --> 48:50.787
You were there when she died.

48:51.361 --> 48:54.922
You don <i>'</i> t understand. l loved her.

48:55.032 --> 48:58.900
When l die, her secret name
will be the first name l <i>'</i> ll call.

48:59.002 --> 49:01.664
l will make her celestial goddess
of my planet.

49:01.772 --> 49:06.402
You loved her but you let the Apostle
take her away and kill her.

49:06.510 --> 49:08.068
l had no choice.

49:08.178 --> 49:10.840
You <i>'</i> re responsible for her death!

49:16.119 --> 49:20.021
Jonathan! Jonathan! Stop!
Stop, Jonathan! You <i>'</i> ll kill him!

49:20.123 --> 49:23.251
-Just like he killed my mother!
-He didn <i>'</i> t kill her!

49:23.360 --> 49:26.420
-He was there!
-He didn <i>'</i> t kill her!

49:27.264 --> 49:30.256
-l saw him there.
-He didn <i>'</i> t kill her.

49:30.367 --> 49:34.201
The Danites killed her
and the Apostle made him watch.

49:35.038 --> 49:37.836
My mother said he cried for months.

49:45.115 --> 49:50.815
l would die for the woman l loved
before l saw her murdered.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.135
Get up!

50:12.709 --> 50:13.971
Get up.

50:16.646 --> 50:17.977
What for?

50:18.081 --> 50:20.174
You <i>'</i> re going to the temple
for your endowments.

50:20.283 --> 50:21.250
But...

50:22.319 --> 50:26.187
l haven <i>'</i> t taken the test.
How can l get a recommend?

50:26.289 --> 50:28.757
l <i>'</i> m the Bishop.
l decide what you do and when you do it.

50:28.859 --> 50:33.228
You <i>'</i> re temple-worthy, and you <i>'</i> re going to
the temple whether you like it or not.

50:33.330 --> 50:35.628
Your brothers will escort you.

50:40.203 --> 50:43.934
Don <i>'</i> t argue, Jonathan. Just do it.

51:09.332 --> 51:13.029
Everyone who passes through
their endowment in the Temple

51:13.136 --> 51:17.766
are placed under the most sacred obligation
to avenge the blood of the Prophet

51:17.908 --> 51:20.172
whenever an opportunity arises.

51:20.310 --> 51:23.905
You must teach your children
to do the same.

51:24.014 --> 51:28.713
The entire Mormon people are sworn and
avowed enemies of the American nation.

51:28.819 --> 51:32.186
The blood of Christ will never wipe that out.

51:33.123 --> 51:36.650
Your own blood must atone for it,
and the judgments of the Almighty

51:36.760 --> 51:42.198
will come, sooner or later,
and every man or woman will have to atone

51:42.299 --> 51:45.097
for breaking their covenant.

51:45.202 --> 51:49.901
<i>''</i> We and each of us covenant and promise

51:50.006 --> 51:53.772
<i>''</i> that we will not reveal
any of the secrets of this,

51:53.877 --> 51:57.643
<i>''</i> the second token of Aaronic priesthood

51:57.747 --> 52:02.275
<i>''</i> with its accompanying name,
sign or penalty.

52:02.385 --> 52:07.254
<i>''</i> Should we do so,
we agree to have our breasts cut open

52:07.357 --> 52:11.691
<i>''</i> and our hearts and vitals
torn out from our bodies

52:11.795 --> 52:16.391
<i>''</i> and given to the birds of the air
and the beasts of the field.<i>''</i>

54:18.788 --> 54:21.985
Hold me. Don <i>'</i> t ever let me go.

54:22.092 --> 54:25.118
l won <i>'</i> t, l promise.

54:26.663 --> 54:28.995
l didn <i>'</i> t think you were coming.

54:29.332 --> 54:31.596
l will always come back for you.

54:33.003 --> 54:36.803
Nothing, nobody will ever keep
anything between us.

54:38.742 --> 54:41.267
l have never met anyone like you.

54:42.512 --> 54:44.980
l <i>'</i> ve never met anyone like you.

54:46.416 --> 54:50.819
l <i>'</i> ve loved you since the first moment
l saw your beautiful face.

54:54.024 --> 54:59.360
We don <i>'</i> t even know each other.
Do you think it can happen so fast?

55:00.130 --> 55:02.291
Love at first sight.

55:04.134 --> 55:08.503
lt <i>'</i> s only a matter of minutes,
or maybe seconds.

55:09.839 --> 55:12.967
-And it lasts forever.
-Forever.

55:20.884 --> 55:25.514
Jonathan, does your father have more
than one wife?

55:27.757 --> 55:31.818
Yes. He has 18.

55:32.962 --> 55:36.864
Eighteen? How can a man
have so many wives?

55:36.966 --> 55:41.835
Well, the Prophet, Brigham Young,
he has 27.

55:42.906 --> 55:46.842
Well, how many wives will you have?

55:48.311 --> 55:52.611
Well, if l married someone like you,

55:54.751 --> 55:57.481
why would l want to marry anybody else?

56:24.147 --> 56:27.674
Captain Fancher! Oh, dear God, no.

56:27.784 --> 56:29.411
God, no!

56:30.153 --> 56:33.179
-We found her in the river.
-Captain Fancher!

56:33.623 --> 56:35.056
Oh, God.

56:35.859 --> 56:38.589
Don <i>'</i> t let the children see this.
What happened?

56:38.695 --> 56:41.789
We don <i>'</i> t know.
We found her floating in the river.

56:41.898 --> 56:44.628
-What were you doing down at the river?
-l just went there to bathe.

56:44.734 --> 56:45.723
And what were you doing there?

56:45.835 --> 56:48.030
Emily, you need to be
with Nancy <i>'</i> s children now.

56:48.138 --> 56:50.766
-But...
-Emily, they <i>'</i> re alone now.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.973
-Where are you going?
-To help...

56:57.080 --> 56:59.514
l don <i>'</i> t think that <i>'</i> s a good idea
right now, son.

56:59.616 --> 57:03.575
You <i>'</i> re not one of us. You don <i>'</i> t belong here.

57:03.686 --> 57:07.315
Best be on your way.
Let us take care of our own.

57:09.292 --> 57:10.725
l <i>'</i> m sorry.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.158
l <i>'</i> m very sorry.

57:45.829 --> 57:50.095
ln these perilous times, it <i>'</i> s important
to remember God <i>'</i> s commandment

57:50.200 --> 57:53.033
to love even those who hate us.

57:54.337 --> 57:57.568
<i>''</i> Thou hast commanded us
to keep thy precepts diligently.

57:57.674 --> 58:00.802
<i>''</i> O that my ways were directed
to keep thy statutes!<i>''</i>

58:00.910 --> 58:03.504
<i>''</i> Thou hast rebuked
the proud that are cursed,

58:03.613 --> 58:06.446
<i>''</i> which do err from thy commandments.<i>''</i>

58:06.549 --> 58:08.710
<i>''</i> l <i>'</i> ve chosen the way of truth.<i>''</i>

58:21.397 --> 58:22.887
Jonathan.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.328
Jonathan, wake up.

58:36.312 --> 58:38.109
You <i>'</i> re still here.

58:38.715 --> 58:40.410
l couldn <i>'</i> t leave.

58:42.652 --> 58:45.143
We <i>'</i> re leaving soon.

58:46.222 --> 58:49.385
And Captain Fancher wants us gone
by first light.

58:49.759 --> 58:51.226
First light?

58:52.195 --> 58:53.321
Yes.

58:53.696 --> 58:56.893
Nancy <i>'</i> s death has made us all very nervous.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.991
Then l <i>'</i> m going with you.

59:00.370 --> 59:03.897
-To California?
-Yes, to California.

59:05.241 --> 59:09.439
You would leave everything
and just come with me to California?

59:09.646 --> 59:10.977
Yes.

59:12.148 --> 59:16.050
Because l love you
and l want you to marry me.

59:18.321 --> 59:19.583
You do?

59:22.225 --> 59:24.557
l would give up my life for you.

59:36.272 --> 59:38.763
This is my pledge to marry you.

59:44.113 --> 59:47.105
And this represents
my commitment to leave.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.793
She <i>'</i> s beautiful.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.128
She was my mother.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.973
She would have loved you.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.756
l have to get back before they miss me.

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:32.589
l <i>'</i> ll slip out early
and l <i>'</i> ll be back by first light.

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:35.230
-All right.
-l promise.

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:02.491
l <i>'</i> ve asked for this special meeting
of the Saints

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:07.655
because we <i>'</i> re about to embark
on one of our greatest missions.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.264
Not even your closest wives must know.

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.234
You all agree to a vow of secrecy?

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.737
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:20.332
The Gentiles have once again
invaded our land.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.639
l had a vision.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.413
-l had a vision.
-What <i>'</i> s going on?

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.108
Where were you?

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:35.623
The Prophet Joseph Smith
came to me last night and he said,

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:41.990
<i>''</i> How long will you let the Gentiles
continue to drive us away? <i>''</i>

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.932
And l couldn <i>'</i> t answer him.
l couldn <i>'</i> t answer him.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:51.606
Then Joseph Smith whispered that God
has decreed these Gentiles are cursed.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.874
And that they will murder
every Mormon man, woman and child.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.808
-Never! Never!
-Wait!

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.210
-Stop it!
-Wait, let me speak!

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.145
Mormon Saints,
do you remember the Mormon War?

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:01.614
Yes!

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.919
They ran us out of Missouri!

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.478
Are we going to wait for them to burn
our houses and slaughter us again?

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.888
No! No! No!

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:13.359
-These Gentiles must die!
-Yes! Die!

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:16.864
lt <i>'</i> s not true! lt <i>'</i> s not true!

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.228
l <i>'</i> ve been among them.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.996
Upon your order, l <i>'</i> ve spied on them.

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:24.369
l didn <i>'</i> t see or hear anything
to support what you <i>'</i> re saying.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.339
Have you forgotten your pledge

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.002
to obey the Prophet and the Apostles
without question?

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.808
The Prophet and his Apostles sent word

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.246
that they were each given
the same revelation from God.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.544
Joseph Smith said,

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:39.985
<i>''</i> As Aaron was chosen by Jehovah
to speak for Jehovah to lsrael,

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:46.187
<i>''</i> so Jehovah created me, Joseph Smith,
to be your God on Earth.<i>''</i>

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:47.353
Hallelujah!

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.954
<i>''</i> The Apostles were chosen
to be my mouth.<i>''</i>

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.055
Hallelujah!

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:55.536
To question the Prophet and the Apostles
is to question Jehovah himself!

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:58.630
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:04.311
We, we have been honored

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:08.811
above all other men
to be the chosen instruments of death

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:12.410
in carrying out this merciful deed.
lt is our sacred duty!

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:17.186
Through their deaths,
these Gentiles will obtain eternal salvation.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:23.425
We are to consider their deaths
a virtuous act of grace and mercy.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.925
Brethren, we have a duty to perform.

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.436
lt is a duty we owe to God
and to our Church.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:35.068
The orders of those in authority
are that all the emigrants must die.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:37.408
Amen! Amen!

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.472
Our leaders speak with inspired tongues,

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.950
and their orders come
from the God of Heaven.

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.783
We have no right to question
what they have commanded us to do.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:49.050
lt is our duty to obey.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.150
And what of the laws of our land?

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:54.855
Do we disobey the laws of our country?

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:59.628
Whether we like it or not,
we <i>'</i> re still part of the United States.

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:02.169
How dare you question
the voice of the Heavenly Father?

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.705
l do not question the Heavenly Father,

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:09.301
l question what the Prophet
and the Apostles think they heard.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.677
ls it not possible
that Satan has deceived us all?

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.675
The Prophet and the Apostles
never make mistakes!

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:18.481
They <i>'</i> re called
by the Heavenly Father himself!

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:21.352
Although you are my son,
l warn you, beware.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:26.588
Lest Joseph Smith and Jehovah demand
your blood as atonement for your sins.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.130
-You know the penalties for disobedience.
-Amen!

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:32.292
The Prophet decrees
a crown of celestial glory for all

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.961
who are faithful and willingly obey.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.629
Hallelujah!

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.730
-Blood atonement!
-Blood atonement!

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.641
Blood atonement! Blood atonement!
Blood atonement!

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:45.839
Blood atonement! Blood atonement!
Blood atonement!

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:48.439
-Have you all gone mad?
-Blood atonement!

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.418
Traitor! Arrest him! Arrest him!

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.521
Tie him up!
Make sure he can <i>'</i> t warn the emigrants!

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.260
For the love of God!

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:05.095
We praise you, Joseph Smith,

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:08.534
and vow to avenge your blood
and the blood of all the other Saints

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.162
murdered by these wicked people!

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:14.432
<i>Blood atonement! Blood atonement!</i>
<i>Blood atonement!</i>

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.424
Father, please.

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.822
You can <i>'</i> t do this.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.864
Try to understand.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:41.665
Before Joseph Smith picked me off
the streets, l had no future.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:46.473
He changed all that, made me a bishop.
l have more than l ever dreamed of,

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.271
money, respect, beautiful wives.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:54.441
l owe everything to him.
He believed in me before anyone else did.

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.040
Do you understand how much
that meant to me?

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.780
For the first time, l understood

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:01.288
that l had it in me
to become a god someday.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.154
l was no longer a failure.
There is greatness in me.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.128
And so you choose
to kill innocent women and children?

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:11.056
They <i>'</i> re not innocent.

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:15.164
Yes, they are, Father.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:19.466
Like lambs to the slaughter.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:24.144
They murdered Mormon children
in Missouri.

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:28.408
God demands their blood spill
on the earth to atone for sins

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.451
that can never be wiped away
by Christ <i>'</i> s blood.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:33.215
We <i>'</i> re saving their eternal lives,

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:37.053
giving them a chance
to get into one of the heavens.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.320
And you really believe that?

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:44.661
How can you all blindly honor and obey
as a god on earth

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:48.799
a man who went to school for two months?

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.674
Brigham Young is an uneducated madman.

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.044
Please.

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.442
No, please!

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.880
So you think he <i>'</i> s God on Earth?

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:13.691
Well, if he is, let him hear me now!

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.389
He <i>'</i> s a crazy tyrant!

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:04.094
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.696
God will bless you.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:09.005
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:12.808
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.015
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.846
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.944
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.350
God will bless you.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:25.086
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom in the last days.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:28.425
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:32.131
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.497
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.764
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.930
<i>God will bless you.</i>

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.272
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:44.538
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.113
<i>God will bless you.</i>

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:48.011
God will bless you
for building up his kingdom.

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:49.640
God will bless you.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:53.313
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.615
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.055
<i>God will bless you.</i>

01:09:57.159 --> 01:10:00.560
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom in the last days.</i>

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.756
<i>God will bless you</i>
<i>for building up his kingdom.</i>

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.298
<i>God will bless you.</i>

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.067
lndians!

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.931
lt <i>'</i> s lndians!

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.443
Come on, let <i>'</i> s go!

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.070
Ready arms!

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.377
Draw those knives!

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.009
Help!

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.581
Help them load!

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:12.798
Powder!

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.028
Rob, behind you!

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.500
Now, get over there. Get out!

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.720
No!

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:45.756
Now, now!

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:48.700
Look out!

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.133
We <i>'</i> re out of ammo!

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.550
Get down, now!

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.003
Stay down!

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.944
-He said he <i>'</i> d come back.
-Who?

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:44.344
Jonathan. He said he <i>'</i> d come back.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.513
l <i>'</i> m sure he tried.
Maybe he can <i>'</i> t get through.

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.656
He asked...

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.888
He asked me to marry him.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.692
And he said he wanted to come
with me to California.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:05.306
So we exchanged
our most precious possession.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:12.211
l gave him my cross. Are you angry?

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.814
l could never be angry with you,
no matter what.

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:25.857
lf we get out of this, will you marry us?

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:29.963
l would be proud to marry you.

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:33.365
lt has always been my dream to do so.

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.206
Pray for him.

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.404
l love him so much.

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:53.487
l volunteered to ride
to the Mormons for help.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.489
lt would give me great peace of mind

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:58.560
if you would look after my daughter
while l <i>'</i> m gone.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.718
lsn <i>'</i> t there anyone else?

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.626
You should be here with your baby
at a time like this.

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:06.997
l <i>'</i> m the best rider we got.
We have the best chance if I am riding.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:11.600
l will look after her
as though she were my own.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.581
Return safely, Robert.

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:41.432
Let <i>'</i> s go.

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:08.089
lt <i>'</i> s been four days.
l don <i>'</i> t know how long we can hold out.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:12.633
Our food <i>'</i> s low, we have no water.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.863
They know we <i>'</i> ll die without water.
All they have to do is wait.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.337
Our ammunition is almost gone.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:29.016
Captain Baker is dead. l <i>'</i> m the only leader,
and, God help me, l don <i>'</i> t know what to do.

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.455
We can pray.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.628
We can all pray together.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:46.461
<i>''</i> The Lord is my shepherd, l shall not want.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:51.330
<i>''</i> He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.807
<i>''</i> He leadeth me beside the still waters.

<i>''</i> He restoreth my soul.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:17:02.048
<i>''</i> He leadeth me in the paths of

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:05.415
<i>''</i> Yea, though l walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.048
<i>''</i> l will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:13.958
<i>''</i> Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:19.125
<i>''</i> Thou preparest a table before me

<i>''</i> Thou anointest my head with oil,

<i>''</i> Surely goodness and mercy shall

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:36.014
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:52.265
These are your orders
from President Haight.

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:53.925
lt has been sent by the Council at Cedar City

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:57.233
and it has been approved
by all highest authorities.

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:12.083
Sir?

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.347
l cannot do this.

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.356
President Haight has counseled
with Colonel Dame

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:21.521
and has orders from him to put
all of the emigrants out of the way.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:24.827
None who are old enough to talk
are to be spared.

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.902
Brethren.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:38.108
The entire camp are cut-throats,
robbers and assassins.

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.807
They are a part of the people
who drove the Saints from Missouri,

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:44.943
and who helped shed the blood
of our prophets, Joseph and Hyrum.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:49.990
lt is our orders from all in authority
to get the emigrants from their stronghold.

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:54.985
Brother Lee, the brethren in the priesthood
are united in this.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:58.066
lt would not go well with you
to oppose them.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.370
Let us pray on this matter again.

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:20.586
Brethren, l have the evidence
of God <i>'</i> s approval of our mission.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.985
lt is God <i>'</i> s will that we carry out
our instructions to the letter.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.322
Amen.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:59.483
Micah? Thank God.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.328
Micah!

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.788

Micah!

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:49.709
Jonathan. Jonathan. Help me.

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:52.075
Get me out of here. l can <i>'</i> t help you in here.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.876
-l can <i>'</i> t do it anymore.
-Do what?

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.552
Oh, my God, what <i>'</i> s happening?

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:02.248
Micah, what <i>'</i> s happening?

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.822
The lndians and the wagon train.

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:12.526
lt <i>'</i> s awful. lt <i>'</i> s awful.

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.667
l can <i>'</i> t make any sense of it.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:23.044
Micah, you tell me
what <i>'</i> s happening at the wagon train,

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:25.942
or so help me, l will cut your throat!

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:30.608
Yes, of course. Blood atonement.

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:33.944
You, too?

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.718
l thought you were the innocent one.

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:40.454
Tell me, please.

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:49.198
We attacked. lt <i>'</i> s started.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:54.305
-Get me out of here. Please.
-lt <i>'</i> s too late.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.437
lt <i>'</i> s too late. lt <i>'</i> s started. lt <i>'</i> s too late for me.
lt <i>'</i> s too late for everybody.

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:01.106
-lt <i>'</i> s started. lt <i>'</i> s too late.
-Micah!

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:03.414
Micah!

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.783
Micah!

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:12.121
Use this on the chain, and free yourself.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:18.657
And when you get free, Jonathan,
you run as far and as fast as you can.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:23.500
Do not come back and do not look back.
Save yourself from this while you still can.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.039
No, l have to go to her. l have to.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:31.306
There <i>'</i> ll be nothing left to go to, Jonathan.
You run. Run.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.982
Micah.

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:39.076
Goodbye, my brother.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.113
No.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.720
No, Micah, don <i>'</i> t.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.254
l <i>'</i> m going to follow the brethren

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:50.593
and do my duty to the Mormon god,
Brigham Young.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:55.459
Micah. Micah! Micah!

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:23.024
-l didn <i>'</i> t see it.
-What?

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.026
l didn <i>'</i> t see the sun rise.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:34.038
They <i>'</i> re coming! Get ready!

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:43.076
Hold your fire!

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:49.548
Thank God. lt <i>'</i> s the Mormons!

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:24.150
l <i>'</i> m John D. Lee,
lndian Commissioner for this district.

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:26.784
We <i>'</i> ve got the lndians under control.

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:29.793
Come with us, and you <i>'</i> ll be safe.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:33.129
Thank God. They <i>'</i> ve been at us for days.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.792
l don <i>'</i> t think
we could have lasted much longer.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:38.464
Most of the lndians trust us. We have
an agreement worked out with them.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.371
But we must move quickly before
the dissenters convince the others

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.103
to attack again.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.081
Don <i>'</i> t worry, we <i>'</i> ve dealt with them before.

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:49.741
What should we do?

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:54.720
We must take all the weapons, all your guns,
and put them in one of the wagons.

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.055
Why should we give up our guns?

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:01.424
We have to give the appearance of peace.
No weapons.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.759
l don <i>'</i> t like us giving up our guns.
We <i>'</i> d be defenseless.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:08.562
Sir, we know these savages.
They know that we are a militia.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.701
We have to convince them
that you are in our custody.

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.934
Giving up our weapons
doesn <i>'</i> t make much sense.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:19.445
Nothing we have to do in order to
appease the lndians makes much sense, sir.

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:20.980
Trust me.

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:26.316
Don <i>'</i> t worry,
we will transport you to Cedar City in safety.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.720
Once there, you will be cared for

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:34.022
until the opportunity comes for you
to be taken to California.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:38.361
l don <i>'</i> t know about the others,
but l <i>'</i> ve got a bad feeling about this.

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:44.299
We <i>'</i> re out of water.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:47.404
We <i>'</i> re almost out of food,

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:51.206
and the guns will do us no good
without ammunition.

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.728
All right.

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:11.560
Put all children, eight years old
and younger, into the other wagon.

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.635
-l <i>'</i> m not giving you my child.
-Neither am l.

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:19.238
Do you want to save your babies?
Then put them into that wagon.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.101
There <i>'</i> ll be armed guards all around.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:25.577
Your babies will be protected better
than your gold.

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:35.987
-Take good care of him, Reverend.
-l will.

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:45.460
Please comfort her, Reverend.
She <i>'</i> s so afraid.

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:49.128
l will take care of them all
as if they were my own Emily.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.474
-Take care of them, will you?
-l will.

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:36.676
<i>This is loving our neighbor as ourselves.</i>

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.843
<i>If he needs help, help him.</i>

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.818
<i>If he wishes salvation,</i>

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:47.122
<i>and it is necessary to spill his blood</i>
<i>upon the ground in order that he be saved,</i>

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:48.593
<i>spill it.</i>

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:52.223
<i>Will you love</i>
<i>your brothers and sisters likewise,</i>

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:55.234
<i>when they have committed a sin</i>
<i>that cannot be atoned for</i>

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:57.668
<i>without the shedding of their blood?</i>

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.900
<i>Will you love that man or woman</i>
<i>well enough to shed their blood?</i>

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:03.034
<i>That is what Jesus Christ meant.</i>

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:07.911
<i>He never told a man or woman</i>
<i>to love their enemies in their wickedness.</i>

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:10.541
<i>He never intended any such thing.</i>

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:13.348
<i>I could refer you to plenty of instances</i>

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:18.289
<i>where men have been righteously slain</i>
<i>in order to atone for their sins.</i>

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.249
Oh, my God.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.582
No.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.119
Halt!

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.298
Wait.

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:56.139
Mormons! Do your duty!

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.804
-Have mercy!
-l do this out of duty.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.068
May God forgive you.

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.875
<i>Oh, Lord, my God, receive their spirits.</i>

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:06.954
<i>We were not to spill</i>
<i>the blood of the innocent!</i>

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:10.046
<i>I shot her before I realized she had a baby.</i>

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:40.011
Micah! Micah! Enough.

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:44.542
The boy <i>'</i> s dead.

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:49.818
-Are you sure?
-Go, do your duty for Jehovah.

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:03.549
Micah?

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:15.993
Micah?

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.991
Follow the brethren. Do my duty.

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.465
Micah.

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:25.364
Micah, where <i>'</i> s Jonathan?

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:29.137
Jonathan.

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.605
He <i>'</i> s free.

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.039
He <i>'</i> s innocent.

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.586
Micah.

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.321
Why are you here?

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:56.664
You shouldn <i>'</i> t be here.
l told you to stay out of this!

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.673
-l told you to leave!
-Jonathan!

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.434
-Micah, give me the gun.
-No.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.567
No, l cannot do that!

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:07.903
-l have to do my duty!
-Micah, you can <i>'</i> t do this.

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:11.112
You <i>'</i> ll be cursed.

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.353
l <i>'</i> m already cursed!

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:31.763
Please, Jonathan,

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.697
shoot me.

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.538
Please. l can <i>'</i> t live like this.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.043
Put me out of my misery, please.

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:45.943
Please...

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.253
l can <i>'</i> t.

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:52.481
-Help me atone for my sins.
-You <i>'</i> re my brother.

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.626
l love you.

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:59.593
Jonathan, if you do this for me,
l <i>'</i> ll be saved.

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:04.600
Please put me out of my misery.

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:08.300
-Kill me before l kill her!
-No! Micah!

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:27.960
Thank you.

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.188
l <i>'</i> m free now.

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.552
No!

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:07.928
Jonathan? Jonathan?

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:14.936
Jonathan?

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.353
Please.

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.036
Jonathan.

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:49.064
You came back.

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:53.436
Nothing or no one could ever keep us apart.

01:40:57.117 --> 01:41:00.575
We <i>'</i> re going to California together,
remember?

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:03.112
California.

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:05.825
Jonathan.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:07.394
Yes?

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:13.757
l don <i>'</i> t... l don <i>'</i> t think
l <i>'</i> m going to make it to California.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:20.203
You can <i>'</i> t die. l won <i>'</i> t let you die!

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:23.275
l don <i>'</i> t think l <i>'</i> m gonna make it.

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:26.141
You have to make it.

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:29.909
lf you die, l die.

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:33.850
-You can <i>'</i> t.
-Don <i>'</i> t die.

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:37.484
l have nothing left but you.

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:41.589
lf you die, l have nothing.

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:31.629
<i>We saved each other</i>
<i>that cold September dawn.</i>

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:38.040
<i>Sixteen children survived,</i>
<i>too young to remember, too young to tell.</i>

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:43.346
<i>They were taken to Mormon families</i>
<i>to be raised.</i>

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:46.817
<i>It was a year and a half before</i>
<i>the United States Army tracked them down</i>

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.514
<i>and returned them to their relatives.</i>

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:53.020
<i>The story of hate will eventually die.</i>

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.821
<i>The story of love will last forever.</i>

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:02.097
<i>When did you first hear</i>
<i>of the attack and destruction</i>

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:07.105
<i>of this Arkansas company</i>
<i>at Mountain Meadows in September 1857?</i>

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:10.767
l did not learn anything
of the attack or destruction

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:15.576
of the Arkansas company
until some time after it occurred,

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.707
and then only by floating rumor.

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:23.751
<i>Did John D. Lee report to you</i>
<i>at any time after this massacre</i>

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:26.690
<i>what had been done</i>
<i>at the massacre and if so,</i>

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:29.455
<i>what did you reply to him</i>
<i>in reference thereto?</i>

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:31.963
<i>Within some two or three months</i>
<i>after the massacre,</i>

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:37.196
he called at my office and had much to say
with regard to the lndians,

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.335
<i>their being stirred up to anger</i>

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.738
<i>and threatening the settlement</i>
<i>of the whites.</i>

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:45.812
<i>He then commenced</i>
<i>giving an account of the massacre.</i>

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:51.782
l told him to stop. l did not wish my feelings
harrowed up by a recital of details.

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:56.151
<i>Did you, on the 10th of September 1857,</i>

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.816
<i>receive a communication</i>
<i>from Isaac C. Haight,</i>

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:00.825
<i>or any other person of Cedar City,</i>

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:04.829
<i>concerning a company of emigrants</i>
<i>called the Arkansas company?</i>

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:08.998
<i>I did, from Isaac C. Haight</i>

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:14.941
or John D. Lee,
who was a farmer for the lndians.

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:21.077
<i>-And have you that communication?</i>
<i>-I have not.</i>

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:26.048
l have made diligent search for it,
but l cannot find it.

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:29.480
<i>Did you answer that communication?</i>

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:36.187
<i>I did, to Isaac C. Haight, who was</i>
<i>then acting President at Cedar City.</i>

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:41.225
<i>Will you state the substance</i>
<i>of your letter to him?</i>

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:45.601
Yes, it was to allow
this company of emigrants

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.901
-and all companies of emigrants...
-Ready.

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.909
<i>...to pass through the country unmolested.</i>

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.569
Aim.

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:58.413
And to allay the angry feelings
of the lndians as much as possible.

01:45:58.785 --> 01:45:59.945
Fire.
