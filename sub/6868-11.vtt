WEBVTT

00:01.337 --> 00:02.885
Ugh, what is that?

00:02.887 --> 00:04.787
I've never smelled
that smell in America.

00:04.789 --> 00:07.157
I live in a
"transitional" neighborhood.

00:07.159 --> 00:09.226
As the crack dealers
move to nicer ones?

00:09.228 --> 00:10.428
This better be good, Krieger.

00:10.430 --> 00:14.833
I mean hula girls, a replica volcano, some --
I have something better!

00:14.835 --> 00:15.967
A surprise!

00:15.969 --> 00:17.771
I hate surprises.

00:17.773 --> 00:19.607
Except surprise fellatio.

00:19.609 --> 00:20.642
That I like.

00:20.644 --> 00:22.143
The non-Midnight Cowboy kind.

00:22.145 --> 00:24.112
Yeah, no, you
can breathe easy.

00:24.114 --> 00:25.680
Actually I can
barely breathe at all.

00:25.682 --> 00:29.183
- Oh, probably the bathroom...
- Jesus, it's a --

00:29.185 --> 00:30.184
A shared bath.

00:30.186 --> 00:32.154
I was going to
say a literal shithole.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.023
Krieger, how and why do you live here?

00:34.025 --> 00:36.059
I use my salary
for "pet" projects.

00:36.061 --> 00:37.194
Nope! Nope!

00:37.196 --> 00:41.166
I had Korean barbecue for lunch, I
cannot look at a Dr. Moreau pig-baby.

00:41.168 --> 00:42.668
Relax, you're gonna love this.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.703
No I'm not, and
also I need to pee.

00:44.705 --> 00:47.706
Don't be nervous,
I'm not gonna rape you.

00:47.708 --> 00:48.974
Jesus Christ!

00:48.976 --> 00:50.877
But you were gonna flay
me like a perch?!

00:50.879 --> 00:51.578
Wh-?

00:51.580 --> 00:52.946
No, that's a wetsuit!

00:52.948 --> 00:54.114
Of human flesh?!

00:54.116 --> 00:55.116
Neoprene!

00:55.118 --> 00:56.183
I'm a certified diver.

00:56.185 --> 00:57.485
Why's it skin-colored?

00:57.487 --> 00:59.253
It's not if you're black.

00:59.255 --> 01:00.955
What is it with
serial killers and skin?

01:00.957 --> 01:03.191
I'm not a... serial killer.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.693
Wait, why'd
you emphasize serial?

01:05.695 --> 01:06.794
I didn't, what?

01:06.796 --> 01:09.030
Are we doing, did I mention
I have a surprise for you?

01:09.032 --> 01:12.233
Krieger!
Equal parts soju sangria and fear-induced

01:12.235 --> 01:13.802
adrenaline means I have to pee.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.572
And not in that sick bathroom, so--
O.K. There's a utility

01:16.574 --> 01:17.473
sink in my lab.

01:17.475 --> 01:18.642
Fine, wherever.

01:18.644 --> 01:19.676
But no surprises.

01:19.678 --> 01:20.344
Right.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.745
Well. Except for the one.

01:21.747 --> 01:24.683
Uh, is the surprise
that you're pirating cable?

01:24.685 --> 01:28.454
No, no, Archer,
I've finally cracked it!

01:28.456 --> 01:30.924
Wow, amazing, you can play YYZ.

01:30.926 --> 01:35.462
First of all, it's Y-Y-Zed,
and second of all, no, I can't yet,

01:35.464 --> 01:36.797
it's impossible.

01:36.799 --> 01:41.070
Well --
And third of all, wrong thing!

01:41.072 --> 01:42.205
Oh my God.

01:42.207 --> 01:43.439
Krieger.

01:43.441 --> 01:44.841
Is that...?

01:44.843 --> 01:46.576
But how did...?

01:46.578 --> 01:49.412
- I mean, at our wedding...
- I know.

01:49.414 --> 01:52.049
- There was a lot of confusion...
- Noooooo!

01:52.051 --> 01:53.117
Katyaaa!

01:53.119 --> 01:57.155
No-ho-ho-hooooo!

01:57.157 --> 02:00.460
Gross and/or ick, and is she...?

02:00.462 --> 02:01.294
Alive?

02:01.296 --> 02:02.095
Yeah, man.

02:02.097 --> 02:04.364
Flick her titty.

02:04.366 --> 02:05.299
Katya!

02:05.301 --> 02:06.300
You're alive!

02:06.302 --> 02:08.269
Well, on, technically.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.003
Either way, you're welcome.

02:10.006 --> 02:11.606
My sweet, beautiful Katya!

02:11.608 --> 02:12.340
It's you!

02:12.342 --> 02:16.477
My darlink Sterlink, you awake
me like the prince of Snow White!

02:16.479 --> 02:17.645
I love you!

02:17.647 --> 02:20.214
I... I love you!

02:20.216 --> 02:24.385
Krieger thank you, this is the --
why do you have an erection?!

02:24.387 --> 02:26.888
I'm happy.

Here they are!

03:03.293 --> 03:05.059
God, geese at the trough.

03:05.061 --> 03:05.927
What?

03:05.929 --> 03:08.530
Are you - thanks for
startiar my sentence for me -

03:08.532 --> 03:10.232
people standing around for?

03:10.234 --> 03:11.500
It's Bear Claw Monday.

03:11.502 --> 03:14.236
And almost nine-thirty,
Pam, in case you were thinking

03:14.238 --> 03:15.971
about, I dunno, working.

03:15.973 --> 03:18.006
Jeez, somebody's raring to go.

03:18.008 --> 03:19.875
Because I burn clean, Cyril.

03:19.877 --> 03:22.378
Because I don't glop up my
engine with bear claws.

03:22.380 --> 03:25.547
And also because --
Hello, friends of ISIS!

03:27.217 --> 03:31.820
- And also because Katya needs a W--  
- Holy shitzombies!

03:31.822 --> 03:32.620
I know, right?

03:32.622 --> 03:33.655
Still crazy hot.

03:33.657 --> 03:36.057
How --
Well for one thing, no bear claws.

03:36.059 --> 03:37.592
is she even here?!

03:37.594 --> 03:40.427
Wait, does this mean you and me --
Pam!

03:40.429 --> 03:43.130
I swear to God, if you people
can't keep it down, this is the last

03:43.132 --> 03:45.433
Bear Claw Mon --

03:45.435 --> 03:46.734
Am I seeing things?!

03:46.736 --> 03:49.971
- No, she's really here...
- Ow, ahh!

03:49.973 --> 03:52.573
And if we don't file her
W-9 that first check will take,

03:52.575 --> 03:53.841
like, eight weeks.

03:53.843 --> 03:56.944
- I'm sorry, I'm a little confused...
- What, by the

03:56.946 --> 03:58.412
dead woman standing here?!

03:58.414 --> 03:59.747
Dressed like a whore?

03:59.749 --> 04:01.883
Dead woman my
still-shapely ass.

04:01.885 --> 04:07.254
She's obviously a double, carved up by
KGB plastic surgeons to look like Katya,

04:07.256 --> 04:08.655
and --
How dare you?!

04:08.657 --> 04:09.390
I'm sorry?

04:09.392 --> 04:12.926
How dare you fail to recognize
my greatest accomplishment to date?!

04:12.928 --> 04:14.962
You finally nailed YYZ?

04:14.964 --> 04:15.929
It's zed!

04:15.931 --> 04:18.365
And no, Neil Peart stands alone.

04:18.367 --> 04:21.535
I was referring... to this!

04:21.536 --> 04:23.436
Katya? On the flourish?

04:23.438 --> 04:28.240
Is when --
Oh! Sorry, doktor...

04:28.242 --> 04:30.609
Just like
the gypsy woman said!

04:30.611 --> 04:32.211
You need to quit going to her.

04:32.213 --> 04:34.179
And you need your head
examined if you think that

04:34.181 --> 04:38.716
abomination is ever
going to work for ISIS!

04:38.718 --> 04:40.018
Abomination?

04:40.020 --> 04:42.019
Baby, come on,
you're not an abomination.

04:42.021 --> 04:44.889
I mean, that's your
original skin, right?

04:44.891 --> 04:46.190
Hobo.

04:46.192 --> 04:46.890
What?

04:46.892 --> 04:47.725
Yes.

04:47.727 --> 04:48.359
See?

04:48.361 --> 04:50.394
But --
Hang on, hang on.

04:50.396 --> 04:51.495
Katya-person.

04:51.497 --> 04:54.732
I'm still processing the
fact that you're a cyborg.

04:54.734 --> 04:56.234
Yeah, way to bury the lead.

04:56.236 --> 04:57.735
Who're you, Horace Greeley?

04:57.737 --> 04:59.570
And also, was I not clear about that?

04:59.572 --> 05:00.338
No!

05:00.340 --> 05:03.808
- Although she does feel a bit clammy...
- Ow! Stop it!

05:03.810 --> 05:04.709
You stop it!

05:04.711 --> 05:07.445
Just because she's a cyborg
doesn't mean you can feel her up!

05:07.447 --> 05:10.782
Da, I hef feelinks
just like all of you.

05:10.784 --> 05:14.453
- I feel love, I leff, I sometimes cry...
- Albeit a

05:14.455 --> 05:15.821
saline-lubricant solution.

05:15.823 --> 05:19.559
Which reminds me, we need to talk about
other, um, internal lubricants like --

05:19.561 --> 05:20.326
Stop!

05:20.328 --> 05:21.695
That sounds like a private matter.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.064
Yeah, that's what I'm talking ab--
And Katya!

05:24.066 --> 05:24.965
My lovely lady.

05:24.967 --> 05:28.001
Needs to go with Pam now
to do her stupid W-9.

05:28.003 --> 05:30.637
But Ms. Archer said--
What, Pam?!

05:30.639 --> 05:33.673
That she's so jealous of my love for
Katya, she won't hire a world-class spy

05:33.675 --> 05:37.911
who also, spoiler alert, can do this?!

05:37.913 --> 05:39.646
Babe, you wanna...?

05:39.648 --> 05:44.084
- Oh! Sorry, darlink...
- Hey!

05:44.086 --> 05:46.053
Wait, or do I mean sploosh?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.955
Ya know, it's probably not the
worst idea in the world to have...

05:48.957 --> 05:53.026
someone like her working at ISIS, since--
Since you wanna

05:53.028 --> 05:53.861
screw affirmative action?

05:53.863 --> 05:56.497
Since the KGB has
someone like Barry!

05:56.499 --> 05:57.565
Barry!

05:57.567 --> 06:00.835
Thet, thet --
Don't worry about Barry.

06:00.837 --> 06:03.004
I'm never gonna let him
hurt you again, baby.

06:03.006 --> 06:03.638
Ha!

06:03.640 --> 06:05.006
It is Barry who should worry!

06:05.008 --> 06:08.042
If I ever see thet <i>zloi
mudak again, I --</i>

06:08.044 --> 06:08.843
<i>Don't worry, you won't!</i>

06:08.845 --> 06:11.112
<i>Yeah he never
calls, he never writes...</i>

06:11.114 --> 06:13.347
<i>So just go with Pam
to do your paperwork --</i>

06:13.349 --> 06:15.983
<i>And I'll go try
to convince Malory</i>

06:15.985 --> 06:17.384
<i>that you'll be an asset to ISIS.</i>

06:17.386 --> 06:20.420
<i>Thank you Lana, that's --
So not doing it for you.</i>

06:20.422 --> 06:22.322
<i>So don't care.</i>

06:22.324 --> 06:23.791
<i>So! Robocop!</i>

06:23.793 --> 06:24.792
<i>Pro or con?</i>

06:24.794 --> 06:25.626
<i>Neither!</i>

06:25.628 --> 06:27.629
<i>I don't want her to be an ISIS agent,</i>

06:27.631 --> 06:30.599
<i>and I certainly don't want her
and Sterling back together!</i>

06:30.601 --> 06:32.568
<i>Well, I can
understand the latter --</i>

06:32.570 --> 06:34.337
<i>I mean, who wears bangs?</i>

06:34.339 --> 06:36.339
<i>-- but it can't hurt to
level the playing field,</i>

06:36.341 --> 06:38.475
<i>now that --
Nikolai has been murdered.</i>

06:38.477 --> 06:42.279
<i>By the new head of the KGB,
who is also a cyborg.</i>

06:42.281 --> 06:44.215
<i>Just like
the gypsy woman said!</i>

06:44.217 --> 06:45.049
<i>Oh for --!</i>

06:45.051 --> 06:47.284
<i>- Oh, alright...
- Really?!</i>

06:47.286 --> 06:48.819
<i>Katya can be an ISIS agent?!</i>

06:48.821 --> 06:49.887
<i>Probationary.</i>

06:49.889 --> 06:53.691
<i>But if I find out the KGB is behind this --
You won't!</i>

06:53.693 --> 06:54.392
<i>They're not!</i>

06:54.394 --> 06:57.028
<i>I'll part her out
and sell her for scrap.</i>

06:57.030 --> 06:58.663
<i>And I thought you were
scared of robots!</i>

06:58.665 --> 07:01.532
<i>I -- no, not
Katya, she's different!</i>

07:01.534 --> 07:02.467
<i>Hmp.</i>

07:02.469 --> 07:04.969
<i>Well don't come crying to me when
she breaks your heart again.</i>

07:04.971 --> 07:07.105
<i>She didn't break my heart,
Mother, she was murdered.</i>

07:07.107 --> 07:10.475
<i>Yes, and then you ran
away from home to, ugh,</i>

07:10.477 --> 07:13.044
<i>grief-bang the entire Pacific Rim.</i>

07:13.046 --> 07:13.845
<i>To what?</i>

07:13.847 --> 07:14.512
<i>Nothing!</i>

07:14.514 --> 07:16.881
<i>Oh please, I bet the
gene pool of Polynesia</i>

07:16.883 --> 07:18.683
<i>is irreparably altered.</i>

07:18.685 --> 07:19.584
<i>Darlink...?</i>

07:19.586 --> 07:21.586
<i>Baby, I was
emotionally shattered.</i>

07:21.588 --> 07:24.656
<i>Which, turns out, to be
kind of a pantydropper.</i>

07:24.658 --> 07:26.091
<i>Is alright, darlink.</i>

07:26.093 --> 07:29.027
<i>I understand this... how do you say?</i>

07:29.029 --> 07:30.262
<i>Griff-bakink.</i>

07:30.264 --> 07:30.896
<i>See?</i>

07:30.898 --> 07:32.697
<i>Is she not something special?</i>

07:32.699 --> 07:34.233
<i>Oh, is special occasion?</i>

07:34.235 --> 07:36.835
<i>Well, the love of my
life, this smoking-hot woman,</i>

07:36.837 --> 07:39.105
<i>was not only murdered and
then brought back to life,</i>

07:39.107 --> 07:42.576
<i>she also just got a job today,
so yeah, pretty special.</i>

07:42.578 --> 07:44.177
<i>- Uh...
- Shut up.</i>

07:44.179 --> 07:45.412
<i>Babe? What're you hungry for?</i>

07:45.414 --> 07:46.681
<i>I am thinking.</i>

07:46.683 --> 07:48.750
<i>While she thinks, bring
me some soup dumplings.</i>

07:48.752 --> 07:50.853
<i>No, no, I am thinking
about your mother.</i>

07:50.855 --> 07:53.789
<i>God, don't waste the
ROM, or RAM, whatever.</i>

07:53.791 --> 07:54.924
<i>Does she hate what I am?</i>

07:54.926 --> 07:56.660
<i>What you are, meaning
"the one woman who can</i>

07:56.662 --> 07:59.263
<i>free her child from the
psychological prison she's spent</i>

07:59.265 --> 08:00.698
<i>a lifetime erecting?"</i>

08:00.700 --> 08:03.835
<i>No, darlink, meaning a...
cyborg.</i>

08:03.837 --> 08:05.403
<i>She'd hate you
no matter what you are.</i>

08:05.405 --> 08:07.438
<i>Because I did not
ask to be this way...</i>

08:07.440 --> 08:10.141
<i>Yeah, hey, me
either, vis a vis Mother.</i>

08:10.143 --> 08:11.709
<i>And you?</i>

08:11.711 --> 08:13.043
<i>Do you think I am a monster?</i>

08:13.045 --> 08:16.347
<i>Baby, I don't care about
the chips and gears and...</i>

08:16.349 --> 08:17.615
<i>I assume some hinges?</i>

08:17.617 --> 08:21.485
<i>All I care about is what I see
when I look into those big green--</i>

08:21.487 --> 08:23.921
<i>oh, I guess they're red now, huh?</i>

08:23.923 --> 08:24.989
<i>Anyway, your eyes.</i>

08:24.991 --> 08:26.390
<i>Da?</i>

08:26.392 --> 08:28.593
<i>And what do you see in my eyes?</i>

08:28.595 --> 08:31.329
<i>Mostly those insane boobs.</i>

08:31.331 --> 08:32.397
<i>Check!</i>

08:32.399 --> 08:33.432
<i>Ah.</i>

08:33.433 --> 08:34.833
<i>Ooh.</i>

08:34.836 --> 08:35.934
<i>Eee.</i>

08:35.937 --> 08:37.369
<i>Unn.</i>

08:37.371 --> 08:38.236
<i>Ahhhh.</i>

08:38.239 --> 08:38.904
<i>Darlink?</i>

08:38.905 --> 08:39.938
<i>Are you alright?</i>

08:39.941 --> 08:41.573
<i>Yes, no, yes.</i>

08:41.576 --> 08:42.674
<i>Yes.</i>

08:42.677 --> 08:46.312
<i>Lot of feelings coming together,
just trying to process.</i>

08:46.314 --> 08:48.448
<i>Not gonna lie, having
some déjà vu here.</i>

08:49.985 --> 08:54.054
<i>Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... ow!</i>

08:54.056 --> 08:55.389
<i>Owwww!</i>

08:55.391 --> 08:57.558
<i>Which, if I gave
it any real thought,</i>

08:57.560 --> 08:59.193
<i>would probably explain a lot.</i>

08:59.195 --> 09:00.728
<i>Try to relex, darlink.</i>

09:00.730 --> 09:02.864
<i>You are, how do you say?</i>

09:02.866 --> 09:03.932
<i>To push a rope?</i>

09:03.934 --> 09:06.368
<i>Sorry, babe, I'll focus.</i>

09:06.370 --> 09:08.147
<i>But could you close your eyes?</i>

09:08.267 --> 09:11.307
<i>I kinda feel like I'm banging
tail-lights on a country road.</i>

09:15.171 --> 09:17.438
<i>I swear to God, if I
went blind right this very</i>

09:17.440 --> 09:19.073
<i>second I'd be okay with that.</i>

09:19.075 --> 09:20.741
<i>Oh, dun't say that!</i>

09:20.743 --> 09:22.143
<i>Mr. Sleepy Head!</i>

09:22.145 --> 09:22.977
<i>Sleep?</i>

09:22.979 --> 09:25.446
<i>I've been doing yogic breathing
work for two hours.</i>

09:25.448 --> 09:27.047
<i>My balls are like cran-baisins.</i>

09:27.049 --> 09:27.814
<i>What?</i>

09:27.816 --> 09:28.882
<i>Cranberry raisins?</i>

09:28.884 --> 09:29.916
<i>Craisins?</i>

09:29.918 --> 09:32.986
<i>Whatever, yes, I
call them cran-baisins.</i>

09:32.988 --> 09:34.188
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

09:34.190 --> 09:36.056
<i>I em amazink!</i>

09:36.058 --> 09:38.558
<i>Don't take this
the wrong way, but duh.</i>

09:38.560 --> 09:40.927
<i>I mean our love, darlink.</i>

09:40.929 --> 09:44.663
<i>It feels like...
what is a giant, unstoppable wave?</i>

09:44.665 --> 09:47.332
<i>Wait, you know craisins,
but you don't know tsunami?</i>

09:47.334 --> 09:49.968
<i>Da, then our
love is like tsunami.</i>

09:49.970 --> 09:54.372
<i>Or the Mountain Everest.</i>

09:54.374 --> 09:55.872
<i>An apt metaphor.</i>

09:55.874 --> 10:01.044
<i>Because not only am I lightheaded,
certain parts of me are --</i>

10:01.046 --> 10:04.548
<i>Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb!</i>

10:06.386 --> 10:08.753
- <i>They are not coming back.
- Why?</i>

10:08.755 --> 10:10.021
<i>In the sink?</i>

10:10.023 --> 10:11.790
<i>Is your... vagina?!</i>

10:11.792 --> 10:12.691
<i>Why?</i>

10:12.693 --> 10:14.193
<i>Darlink, it was dirty.</i>

10:14.195 --> 10:16.863
<i>The remedy for which,
miss, if you'll forgive</i>

10:16.865 --> 10:17.931
<i>my boldness...?</i>

10:17.933 --> 10:20.967
<i>Da, please, Woodhouse,
I think boldness is needed.</i>

10:20.969 --> 10:21.901
<i>What do you suggest?</i>

10:21.903 --> 10:25.071
<i>White vinegar,
mineral oil, and elbow grease.</i>

10:25.073 --> 10:28.808
<i>Same thing we used in the RFC
to clean the engines on our</i>

10:28.810 --> 10:31.410
<i>Sopwith Camels.</i>

10:31.412 --> 10:34.713
<i>And so, with your permission,
while you breakfast on the</i>

10:34.715 --> 10:39.818
<i>terrace I'll get that little
pleasure boat looking Bristol!</i>

10:39.820 --> 10:43.188
<i>I took the liberty of
poaching you an egg.</i>

10:43.190 --> 10:45.524
<i>Is not much of a liberty,
considerink thet you are going</i>

10:45.526 --> 10:46.892
<i>to polish my vagina.</i>

10:46.894 --> 10:48.327
<i>No.</i>

10:48.329 --> 10:50.129
<i>No it isn't.</i>

10:50.131 --> 10:54.033
<i>And when he woke
up from faint, boom!</i>

10:54.035 --> 10:56.501
<i>He ren out of there fest like crezzy.</i>

10:56.503 --> 10:57.402
<i>So.</i>

10:57.404 --> 10:58.403
<i>You dated him.</i>

10:58.405 --> 10:59.371
<i>What do you think?</i>

10:59.373 --> 11:02.940
<i>I think... hang on.</i>

11:02.942 --> 11:06.843
<i>I think if you're looking for
insight into why Archer is...</i>

11:06.845 --> 11:09.613
<i>Archer, you need to jump in a
time machine and then go have</i>

11:09.615 --> 11:11.782
<i>a treesome with Oedipus
and Sigmund Freud.</i>

11:11.784 --> 11:13.384
<i>Thanks for nothing.</i>

11:13.386 --> 11:14.118
<i>Well?!</i>

11:14.120 --> 11:16.320
<i>I don't really have a roadmap
for my ex finding your</i>

11:16.322 --> 11:18.222
<i>robo-gina in the sink.</i>

11:18.224 --> 11:19.690
<i>In the sink, Cyril!</i>

11:19.692 --> 11:20.858
<i>In the sink!</i>

11:20.860 --> 11:22.661
<i>It was like a
transistor radio and a</i>

11:22.663 --> 11:24.530
<i>veal cutlet had a baby!</i>

11:24.532 --> 11:27.299
<i>Well gross and/or ick--
Right?!</i>

11:27.301 --> 11:29.102
<i>-- but I don't see why
that means you have to drink my</i>

11:29.104 --> 11:29.970
<i>Glengoolie Blue!</i>

11:29.972 --> 11:31.638
<i>Because the liquor
stores aren't open yet,</i>

11:31.640 --> 11:34.274
<i>and she made me pour out all
the booze at my house!</i>

11:34.276 --> 11:35.576
<i>Holy shit, really?</i>

11:35.578 --> 11:36.511
<i>Glengoolie Blue?</i>

11:36.513 --> 11:38.780
<i>Yeah, and it's three
hundred a bottle...</i>

11:38.782 --> 11:41.983
<i>I -- which I haven't even tasted yet!</i>

11:41.985 --> 11:45.453
<i>Because I was saving it
for a special occasion!</i>

11:45.455 --> 11:48.123
<i>Befitting a gift from my grandfather!</i>

11:48.125 --> 11:50.458
<i>Who's dead!</i>

11:50.460 --> 11:52.527
<i>Of course he is,
he'd be like, a hundred.</i>

11:52.529 --> 11:53.795
<i>It's almost empty!</i>

11:53.797 --> 11:55.630
<i>Just like my heart, Cyril --</i>

11:55.632 --> 11:57.231
<i>Well, not your liver...
-- because she ripped</i>

11:57.233 --> 11:58.065
<i>it out!</i>

11:58.067 --> 11:59.066
<i>Wait, your liver?</i>

11:59.068 --> 12:00.001
<i>My heart!</i>

12:00.003 --> 12:01.702
<i>And threw it in the sink!</i>

12:01.704 --> 12:03.004
<i>Wait, her vagina?</i>

12:03.006 --> 12:04.605
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

12:04.607 --> 12:07.708
<i>- Oh for --</i>-

12:07.710 --> 12:09.743
<i>The old man knew his scotch.</i>

12:09.745 --> 12:12.912
<i>You are such an... asshole!</i>

12:13.782 --> 12:14.748
<i>Wait, really?</i>

12:14.750 --> 12:15.949
<i>Yes, really!</i>

12:15.951 --> 12:18.151
<i>That was a gift to my grandfather!</i>

12:18.153 --> 12:19.285
<i>From Frank!</i>

12:19.287 --> 12:20.420
<i>Sinatra!</i>

12:20.422 --> 12:22.088
<i>Well then I feel even worse,</i>

12:22.090 --> 12:24.291
<i>because I'm probably gonna
puke it up in about five --</i>

12:24.293 --> 12:25.726
<i>One minutes.</i>

12:25.728 --> 12:27.194
<i>But I meant about Katya.</i>

12:27.196 --> 12:30.632
<i>Yes!
You are an asshole about all things!</i>

12:30.634 --> 12:33.368
<i>But, specifically,
now, about Katya.</i>

12:33.370 --> 12:35.837
<i>Or...
could I hef done something wrung?</i>

12:35.839 --> 12:37.672
<i>Besides leavin yer
cooch in the sink?</i>

12:37.674 --> 12:38.506
Pam! Pam!

12:38.508 --> 12:39.107
<i>What?</i>

12:39.109 --> 12:40.375
<i>That just sounds considerate.</i>

12:40.377 --> 12:44.245
<i>Is just, I know he hez
wery good reason to hate...</i>

12:44.247 --> 12:45.714
<i>people like me.</i>

12:45.716 --> 12:47.316
<i>Who, whores?</i>

12:47.318 --> 12:50.486
<i>And that's twice, sorry,
ignore me, my whole thing is</i>

12:50.488 --> 12:51.754
<i>I just crave attention.</i>

12:51.756 --> 12:55.124
<i>But I mean, Barry
did murder her -- ungh!</i>

12:55.126 --> 12:58.427
<i>And my possible father -- ungh!</i>

12:58.429 --> 13:00.262
<i>And more importantly,
tried to murder me!</i>

13:00.264 --> 13:01.096
<i>Unngh!</i>

13:01.098 --> 13:01.864
<i>Because Barry!</i>

13:01.866 --> 13:03.132
<i>Is a psychopath!</i>

13:03.134 --> 13:06.002
<i>That doesn't mean all
cyborgs are like that!</i>

13:06.004 --> 13:09.506
<i>But Cyril, machines...
can hurt people.</i>

13:09.508 --> 13:11.975
<i>Waaaaaaghhhh!</i>

13:11.977 --> 13:15.780
<i>Well you lost me there,
thankfully, but -- Give me that!</i>

13:15.782 --> 13:17.582
<i>What, was that Peter Lawford's?</i>

13:17.584 --> 13:20.752
<i>No, it was -- Oh shut up,
do you wanna learn something?</i>

13:20.754 --> 13:23.021
<i>- Probably not...
- Because did you</i>

13:23.023 --> 13:24.723
<i>know that in Chinese, the
words for crisis and</i>

13:24.725 --> 13:26.491
<i>opportunity are the sathme word?</i>

13:26.493 --> 13:28.361
<i>And... point?</i>

13:28.363 --> 13:30.363
<i>Hello?!</i>

13:30.365 --> 13:31.431
<i>Actually I have no idea.</i>

13:31.433 --> 13:33.899
<i>They just used to say
that in the hospital.</i>

13:33.901 --> 13:37.870
<i>While they made us fold those
pointy goddamn paper birds.</i>

13:37.872 --> 13:40.306
<i>I think what Cheryl's--
Bawk bawk!</i>

13:40.308 --> 13:41.007
<i>Therapy cranes!</i>

13:41.009 --> 13:41.741
<i>Bawk!</i>

13:41.743 --> 13:44.277
<i>I think what she's trying
to say is you can either think</i>

13:44.279 --> 13:47.381
<i>- of this as a crisis...
- Or an opportunity!</i>

13:47.383 --> 13:48.816
<i>To get closer!</i>

13:48.818 --> 13:52.120
<i>- Hooray...
- By marrying her?!</i>

13:52.122 --> 13:54.389
<i>That actually
was Peter Lawford's.</i>

13:54.391 --> 13:56.759
<i>And why not, you were
gonna marry her before!</i>

13:56.761 --> 13:58.460
<i>Before she wasn't a cyborg.</i>

13:58.462 --> 14:02.630
<i>She's still kind,
smart, insanely hot...</i>

14:02.632 --> 14:04.765
<i>Yeah, and even
though it's detachable,</i>

14:04.767 --> 14:07.034
<i>that vagina is like, mind-shattering.</i>

14:07.036 --> 14:07.701
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

14:07.703 --> 14:12.673
<i>What, does it vibrate, or -- Ow!
Ow! Dammit You started it!</i>

14:12.675 --> 14:14.775
<i>That's my fiancée
you're talking about!</i>

14:14.777 --> 14:15.709
<i>Really?</i>

14:15.711 --> 14:17.711
<i>I can look past
our differences, Cyril,</i>

14:17.713 --> 14:19.246
<i>I'm a much bigger man than you think.</i>

14:19.248 --> 14:21.548
<i>Plus it'll drive Mother crazy.</i>

14:21.550 --> 14:23.818
<i>Plus yes, it vibrates.</i>

14:23.820 --> 14:24.819
<i>Really?!</i>

14:24.821 --> 14:27.721
<i>Yes, really, and... Krieger?</i>

14:27.723 --> 14:28.589
<i>Today?</i>

14:28.591 --> 14:29.189
<i>Hm?</i>

14:29.191 --> 14:29.957
<i>Oh! Sorry.</i>

14:29.959 --> 14:31.659
<i>Little thing
called timing, Krieger.</i>

14:31.661 --> 14:33.694
<i>And the erection's
really not appropriate.</i>

14:33.696 --> 14:35.396
<i>I'm still happy!</i>

14:35.398 --> 14:36.463
<i>Katya?</i>

14:36.465 --> 14:37.431
<i>Baby?</i>

14:37.433 --> 14:41.768
<i>Oh yes, yes, a
thousand times yes!</i>

14:41.770 --> 14:43.670
<i>When's the wedding,
when's the wedding?!</i>

14:43.672 --> 14:45.404
<i>I can actually
marry y'all right here.</i>

14:45.406 --> 14:46.772
<i>Oh for God's sake!</i>

14:46.774 --> 14:49.542
<i>Get it over with!</i>

14:49.544 --> 14:50.409
<i>Brett!</i>

14:50.411 --> 14:51.510
<i>Aaagh!</i>

14:51.512 --> 14:53.078
<i>Wait, do you want me to be a groomsman?</i>

14:53.080 --> 14:53.679
<i>No!</i>

14:53.681 --> 14:55.347
<i>Go to the liquor store
and buy a case of --</i>

14:55.349 --> 14:56.482
<i>three cases of champagne!</i>

14:56.484 --> 14:58.484
<i>Sure, I'll just
limp on down there.</i>

14:58.486 --> 14:59.551
<i>Don't limp, Brett!</i>

14:59.553 --> 15:00.119
<i>Run!</i>

15:00.121 --> 15:03.590
<i>We're having a wedding
in a few short minutes!</i>

15:03.592 --> 15:05.091
<i>And it's a win-win.</i>

15:05.093 --> 15:07.394
<i>Plus it vibrates.</i>

15:09.612 --> 15:12.073
Okay, bride and groom, check.

15:12.075 --> 15:13.709
Bridesmaids, check.

15:13.711 --> 15:15.944
Best man --
Well, best available.

15:15.946 --> 15:18.881
Oh for -- name one,
name one friend of yours.

15:18.883 --> 15:19.749
Shut up.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.385
Ray, don't you have like,
a priest outfit, or...?

15:22.387 --> 15:25.488
No, I wore it to Fetish Night
at The Snug, and it's covered in --

15:25.490 --> 15:26.523
Okay! Ugh.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.957
Red wine, ass.

15:27.959 --> 15:31.427
And who gives this woman to
be wed in holy matrimony?

15:31.429 --> 15:32.262
I do!

15:32.264 --> 15:35.498
And no mother of the groom, so --
Yes! Right here!

15:35.500 --> 15:37.133
Mother! You came!

15:37.135 --> 15:38.667
Phrasing, boom!

15:38.669 --> 15:39.602
Ahem.

15:39.604 --> 15:40.803
Inappropriate.

15:40.805 --> 15:41.570
Alrighty!

15:41.572 --> 15:44.873
So unless anyone - besides Mommie
Dearest - objects to this union --

15:44.875 --> 15:46.842
Uh, I think other Barry might.

15:46.844 --> 15:47.743
Wh-?

15:47.745 --> 15:48.710
Barry?!

15:48.712 --> 15:51.013
Yeah, and I brought bubbly!

15:51.015 --> 15:53.181
You.. <i>. Mudak!</i>

15:53.183 --> 15:53.915
<i>Whoa!</i>

15:53.917 --> 15:56.017
<i>You kiss your mother-board
with that mouth?</i>

15:56.019 --> 15:58.920
<i>And also, is anybody
gonna ask how and why</i>

15:58.922 --> 16:01.122
<i>I knew to show up here?</i>

16:01.124 --> 16:02.691
<i>Is...?</i>

16:02.693 --> 16:03.691
<i>Okay, I'll bite.</i>

16:03.693 --> 16:06.428
<i>By tracking the satellite
signal from Katya's internal</i>

16:06.430 --> 16:10.565
<i>hard drive, which Doctor Dipshit
over there, bought from the KGB!</i>

16:10.567 --> 16:11.199
<i>Wh-?!</i>

16:11.201 --> 16:12.033
<i>Krieger!</i>

16:12.035 --> 16:14.201
<i>- Yeah, but the savings...
- Like,</i>

16:14.203 --> 16:15.236
<i>eighty bucks you saved.</i>

16:15.238 --> 16:18.005
<i>But nobody's gonna save you, Archer.</i>

16:18.007 --> 16:19.907
<i>Don't you have
that backwards?!</i>

16:19.909 --> 16:20.874
<i>Archer don't!</i>

16:20.876 --> 16:24.845
<i>Everybody down.</i>

16:24.847 --> 16:27.915
<i>Why do I always
forget you're -- ungh!</i>

16:27.917 --> 16:29.517
<i>Darlink!</i>

16:29.519 --> 16:31.886
<i>- Really super-strong...
- Yeah,</i>

16:31.888 --> 16:34.055
<i>walk that off while I kill
your girlfriend again.</i>

16:34.057 --> 16:35.190
<i>Then we do the dance.</i>

16:35.192 --> 16:37.560
<i>Actually, I don't think
I'm in any shape to dance,</i>

16:37.562 --> 16:38.260
<i>right now Barry.</i>

16:38.262 --> 16:40.162
<i>The dance of death, idiot.</i>

16:40.164 --> 16:42.498
<i>But first let's me and you cut a rug.</i>

16:42.500 --> 16:45.168
<i>How you say... come et me, bro.</i>

16:45.170 --> 16:49.471
<i>Rrrrrraaarrrrgh!</i>

16:49.473 --> 16:50.339
<i>Ow.</i>

16:50.341 --> 16:51.673
<i>Is thet the best you got?</i>

16:51.675 --> 16:54.475
<i>Ungh!</i>

16:54.477 --> 16:56.044
<i>Obviously not.</i>

16:56.046 --> 16:58.112
<i>But this is -- oof!</i>

17:06.922 --> 17:07.621
<i>Katyaaa!</i>

17:07.623 --> 17:09.356
<i>Jesus somebody, a little help?!</i>

17:09.358 --> 17:10.457
<i>We are if you'd shut up!</i>

17:10.459 --> 17:11.523
<i>It's pound!</i>

17:11.526 --> 17:12.358
<i>That is pound!</i>

17:12.361 --> 17:17.630
<i>Pound six, pound five two!</i>

17:17.632 --> 17:20.666
<i>I'm confused, what're we --
Here!</i>

17:20.669 --> 17:21.635
<i>Still confused.</i>

17:21.637 --> 17:25.005
<i>Ray, now!</i>

17:25.007 --> 17:25.806
<i>Oh.</i>

17:25.808 --> 17:28.108
<i>Their CPU's are powered
by photovoltaic cells!</i>

17:28.109 --> 17:31.978
<i>Without exposure to a light-source
they'll slowly lose power!</i>

17:31.980 --> 17:32.879
<i>Like vampires?</i>

17:32.881 --> 17:35.648
<i>I -- no, nothing
like vampires, idiot!</i>

17:35.650 --> 17:39.452
<i>Well I'm sorry, Ira Flatow!
From Newton's Apple.</i>

17:39.454 --> 17:41.353
<i>Will you shut up?!</i>

17:41.355 --> 17:43.722
<i>If Barry gets weak enough,
maybe you can overpower him!</i>

17:43.724 --> 17:45.257
<i>I was just gonna say that!</i>

17:45.259 --> 17:46.025
<i>Move!</i>

17:46.027 --> 17:47.093
<i>Sterling, be careful!</i>

17:47.095 --> 17:49.963
<i>Shut up.</i>

17:49.965 --> 17:50.797
<i>Pam!</i>

17:50.799 --> 17:54.168
<i>- It'll spoil...
- God damn it.</i>

17:54.170 --> 17:55.670
<i>Barryyyyy!</i>

17:55.672 --> 17:56.571
<i>Polo!</i>

17:56.573 --> 17:59.908
<i>Will you shut up?!</i>

17:59.910 --> 18:01.109
<i>Polo.</i>

18:01.111 --> 18:05.547
<i>Beset, on all
sides, by idiots...</i>

18:12.322 --> 18:12.988
<i>Brett?!</i>

18:12.990 --> 18:14.056
<i>I thought you were dead!</i>

18:14.058 --> 18:17.692
<i>No, just hurt
really really badly.</i>

18:17.694 --> 18:20.929
<i>Although not nearly as
badly as I am now.</i>

18:20.931 --> 18:23.231
<i>You better not be
bleeding on my carpet!</i>

18:23.233 --> 18:26.100
<i>No, pretty sure
I'm all out of blood.</i>

18:26.102 --> 18:31.239
<i>Well serves you
right, for -- Oh Barry,</i>

18:31.241 --> 18:34.742
<i>- I am coming for you...
- Phrasing, boom.</i>

18:34.744 --> 18:35.543
<i>Brett!</i>

18:35.545 --> 18:37.745
<i>Polo!</i>

18:37.747 --> 18:41.749
<i>And after I kill you, and
defile your cyborg-y corpse,</i>

18:41.751 --> 18:43.651
<i>I'm gonna -- wh-?!</i>

18:43.653 --> 18:44.652
<i>Oh for shit's sake!</i>

18:44.654 --> 18:45.487
<i>Really?!</i>

18:45.489 --> 18:47.422
<i>Woooooo!</i>

18:47.424 --> 18:48.857
<i>Darlink, I ken explen!</i>

18:48.859 --> 18:50.292
<i>Ray, turn the lights on!</i>

18:50.294 --> 18:51.894
<i>Archer no, the photovoltaics!</i>

18:51.896 --> 18:53.595
<i>Turn on the goddamn lights!</i>

18:53.597 --> 18:55.664
<i>Gaaaagh!</i>

18:55.666 --> 18:57.800
<i>Why do I always forget that?!</i>

18:57.802 --> 19:00.236
<i>And how can you explain that?!</i>

19:00.238 --> 19:01.671
<i>What were they, having sex?!</i>

19:01.673 --> 19:02.738
<i>Think so, yeah.</i>

19:02.740 --> 19:04.907
<i>Called it!</i>

19:04.909 --> 19:08.944
<i>As we fought, it became
more like, like dancing.</i>

19:08.946 --> 19:10.546
<i>Bone dancing!</i>

19:10.548 --> 19:11.546
<i>Shut up!</i>

19:11.548 --> 19:13.315
<i>Katya, how could you do this?</i>

19:13.317 --> 19:17.485
<i>I'm sorry I hurt you, but
I realized thet even though</i>

19:17.487 --> 19:20.721
<i>you tried to see past what I
em, Barry and I are the same.</i>

19:20.723 --> 19:23.524
<i>Inside and out.</i>

19:23.526 --> 19:25.593
<i>Except her insides vibrate.</i>

19:25.595 --> 19:26.827
<i>Rrrragh!</i>

19:26.829 --> 19:27.849
<i>Ka-</i>

19:27.969 --> 19:29.467
Always with the forgetting...

19:29.587 --> 19:31.063
We are like two mermaids.

19:31.183 --> 19:32.571
We will swim together.

19:32.691 --> 19:34.953
So, I won't ask you to forgive me...

19:35.073 --> 19:36.995
But could you at least be happy for me?

19:37.115 --> 19:39.341
Because I have finally found a soulmate.

19:39.461 --> 19:40.416
No.

19:41.636 --> 19:43.512
Or whatever...

19:43.941 --> 19:45.958
Yes. Yes.

19:46.078 --> 19:47.378
Thank you, darling.

19:47.498 --> 19:50.300
You will always have
a special place in my...

19:50.641 --> 19:53.280
Well, I guess my C-drive.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.482
Well, other Barry and I...

19:56.602 --> 19:58.582
are in her other special place.

19:58.702 --> 19:59.825
Which, again,

19:59.945 --> 20:01.326
vibrates.

20:01.446 --> 20:02.529
Later, tator.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.593
Well, mother, go ahead and say it.

20:07.713 --> 20:10.033
Oh, Sterling.
You just had your heart broken.

20:10.153 --> 20:11.734
And you don't need a smug

20:11.854 --> 20:13.564
"I told you so" from me.

20:13.684 --> 20:17.574
And smug it would be, because tell you
I most certainly did.

20:20.455 --> 20:23.517
Just like that Electrolux all over again.

20:23.637 --> 20:24.913
So...

20:25.241 --> 20:27.834
- I know that sucked...
- Vacuum cleaner ponds?

20:27.954 --> 20:28.742
Now?

20:28.862 --> 20:29.661
Really?

20:29.781 --> 20:32.171
No idea thankfully about any of that,
but

20:32.291 --> 20:33.903
if you really did love Katya

20:34.161 --> 20:36.319
you gotta be happy that she's happy.

20:36.939 --> 20:38.088
Yeah...

20:38.208 --> 20:39.830
She did look pretty happy, huh?
