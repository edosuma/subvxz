00:10.262 --> 00:12.529
MAN:
Mr. Newman, this is Dr. Cahill.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.293
Please call me
as soon as possible,

00:14.294 --> 00:16.528
or better yet,
maybe you should drive up here

00:16.529 --> 00:19.493
so we can speak in person.
It's, uh, about your mother.

00:19.494 --> 00:20.461
(knocking)

00:25.230 --> 00:28.473
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey. Just to warn you...

00:33.552 --> 00:35.554
What's with the cone?

00:35.555 --> 00:38.729
Sorry. Wilfred got a hot spot
and he won't stop chewing on it.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.268
So the vet said he has to
wear this for a few days.

00:41.269 --> 00:44.538
Days? It's coming off
one second after you leave.

00:44.539 --> 00:46.909
- He seems kind of grumpy.
- Yeah, sometimes he gets like this

00:46.910 --> 00:49.712
(baby talk): when his
mommy's going out of town.

00:49.713 --> 00:51.147
(mocking): "When his mommy's
going out of town."

00:51.148 --> 00:52.747
(normal voice):
Like I give a shit.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.116
Thanks for watching
him this weekend.

00:54.117 --> 00:56.484
Drew and I really need
some time away

00:56.485 --> 00:58.219
to work on our relationship
without any distractions.

00:59.954 --> 01:01.555
Plus Drew really loves Vegas.

01:01.556 --> 01:02.689
Why are you still here?

01:02.690 --> 01:04.022
So what are you and Wilfred

01:04.024 --> 01:05.524
going to do today?

01:05.525 --> 01:07.559
Uh, looks like we might
have to go see my mother.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.794
- Your mother?
- You have a mother?

01:08.795 --> 01:12.834
Yeah. She lives at
a retreat in Ojai...

01:12.835 --> 01:14.504
for artists...

01:14.505 --> 01:15.807
'cause she's an artist.

01:15.808 --> 01:17.810
Well, I hope I get
to meet her someday.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.612
I'd love that.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.946
Well, I should get going.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.716
Mommy's going to miss you.

01:27.990 --> 01:29.324
An artist, huh?

01:29.325 --> 01:30.892
So what got your mom locked up

01:30.893 --> 01:32.862
in the nut hut?

01:32.863 --> 01:35.198
Well, started with a
bunch of little things,

01:35.199 --> 01:38.135
like refusing to eat
anything except avocado.

01:38.136 --> 01:41.640
When she'd show up at my
school dressed for Halloween

01:41.641 --> 01:43.675
three or four times a year.

01:43.676 --> 01:46.812
Then Catherine had
a complete breakdown.

01:46.813 --> 01:48.981
My father wanted to
impress his partners

01:48.982 --> 01:51.149
by having a formal
dinner at our house.

01:51.150 --> 01:53.518
She couldn't handle
the pressure.

01:53.519 --> 01:54.920
She was looking for
a place to hide

01:54.921 --> 01:56.522
and crawled up the chimney.

01:56.523 --> 01:58.258
The fire department
had to pry her out.

01:58.259 --> 01:59.660
I had a similar

01:59.661 --> 02:04.131
situation with my penis
and a vacuum hose.

02:04.132 --> 02:07.635
I had to cut the tube
just to break free.

02:07.636 --> 02:11.138
I still jizzed, but out
of spite, not pleasure.

02:13.242 --> 02:16.078
The point is, it was in front
of my father's whole firm

02:16.079 --> 02:17.580
and all his clients.

02:17.581 --> 02:19.115
He had no choice.

02:19.116 --> 02:21.817
He brought her here
for a psych evaluation.

02:21.818 --> 02:24.353
She could have left
after 72 hours,

02:24.354 --> 02:27.422
but she chose to stay--
for 20 years.

02:27.423 --> 02:30.425
What kind of mother abandons
her family like that?

02:30.426 --> 02:32.227
I'll tell you what kind.

02:32.228 --> 02:34.297
The kind who doesn't give
a shit about your feelings.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.499
The kind who leaves you
where you cry your eyes out,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.301
missing her every night,

02:38.302 --> 02:42.806
and you did nothing wrong,
but Jenna left, anyway.

02:42.807 --> 02:45.743
Jenna?

02:45.744 --> 02:47.411
CAHILL:
Your mother's fine.

02:47.412 --> 02:49.146
In fact, she feels,
and we agree,

02:49.147 --> 02:51.616
that she's ready to venture
back out into the world.

02:51.617 --> 02:54.285
What world?
The world?

02:54.286 --> 02:56.020
Your world.

02:56.021 --> 02:57.689
When patients leave our care,

02:57.690 --> 02:59.691
the most successful transitions

02:59.692 --> 03:02.193
are facilitated
by their family members.

03:02.194 --> 03:03.561
You want me to...?

03:03.562 --> 03:05.396
No. I barely know her.

03:05.397 --> 03:07.765
I only see her a couple
times a year, and...

03:07.766 --> 03:09.334
Why now?

03:09.335 --> 03:12.170
Well, this isn't some
sort of whim, Mr. Newman.

03:12.171 --> 03:14.840
Your mother has wanted to do
this for a very long time.

03:14.841 --> 03:17.009
She's done a lot
of really good work

03:17.010 --> 03:18.544
to get to this point.

03:18.545 --> 03:20.046
Is this wise?

03:20.047 --> 03:21.982
It's been 20 years.

03:21.983 --> 03:23.950
The world has changed.

03:23.951 --> 03:26.921
Hi-def TV and...
other things.

03:26.922 --> 03:28.656
Well, she hasn't
been in a coma.

03:28.657 --> 03:29.991
We have cable.

03:32.127 --> 03:34.195
Fellas, come here.
I just want to talk to you.

03:34.196 --> 03:37.166
I'm not going to hurt yous.
I'm not going to hurt yous!

03:37.167 --> 03:38.734
- I'll kill you!
- Wilfred!

03:38.735 --> 03:40.903
Oh, hey, Ryan.
What's up, mate?

03:40.904 --> 03:42.906
Later, boys.

03:42.907 --> 03:45.375
The doctor wants my mom
to come stay with me.

03:45.376 --> 03:47.310
And I assume
you told him to blow you.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.579
We don't need that crazy
old broad cramping our style.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.581
How can I say no?

03:51.582 --> 03:53.951
She is my mother.

03:53.952 --> 03:55.553
Ryan, you don't
owe her anything.

03:55.554 --> 03:57.589
She left you.
She left her little boy.

04:02.729 --> 04:04.529
Ryan!

04:06.499 --> 04:07.932
Oh!

04:07.933 --> 04:10.836
That's my baby!
My gorgeous boy!

04:10.837 --> 04:13.205
Pried from my womb.

04:13.206 --> 04:16.074
I had planned a vaginal birth,

04:16.075 --> 04:19.711
but Mr. Breach Bottom
here had other plans,

04:19.712 --> 04:23.348
and so the doctor cut
me open and pulled

04:23.349 --> 04:26.484
this beautiful miracle
from my uterus

04:26.485 --> 04:27.885
like a rabbit from a hat.

04:27.886 --> 04:29.320
(laughing)

04:29.321 --> 04:32.023
Oh, I missed you so much!

04:32.024 --> 04:34.192
(laughing)

04:34.193 --> 04:36.027
(sighs):
Oh...

04:36.028 --> 04:38.362
And who's your
little doggy friend?

04:38.363 --> 04:39.831
This is Wilfred.

04:39.832 --> 04:41.132
I'm watching him
for my neighbor.

04:41.133 --> 04:42.233
(hisses)

04:42.234 --> 04:44.735
Be nice, Mittens.

04:44.736 --> 04:47.271
Mittens? Seriously?

04:47.272 --> 04:49.607
Yeah, keep walking, Mittens.

04:49.608 --> 04:52.644
You look like
your father--

04:52.645 --> 04:55.614
minus the thin lips
and the soulless eyes.

04:55.615 --> 04:56.949
Um...

04:56.950 --> 04:58.217
Sorry, sorry.

04:58.218 --> 04:59.853
I should not have said that.

04:59.854 --> 05:02.522
I don't hold any animosity
toward your father.

05:02.523 --> 05:04.525
It has taken me
years of therapy,

05:04.526 --> 05:06.894
but now I can actually
appreciate your father

05:06.895 --> 05:09.697
for what he is-- the man
who pays the bills.

05:09.698 --> 05:11.899
I just met with
Dr. Cahill...

05:11.900 --> 05:14.268
I just couldn't be the kind
of wife that he wanted.

05:14.269 --> 05:17.437
I'm too free-spirited,
too outspoken,

05:17.438 --> 05:18.472
too human.

05:18.473 --> 05:19.640
Whoops.

05:19.641 --> 05:20.975
(laughs)

05:20.976 --> 05:22.176
Indian chief.

05:22.177 --> 05:25.012
(whooping)

05:25.013 --> 05:27.715
That was a little racist,
but it was fun.

05:27.716 --> 05:30.718
How is that racist?
Indians do that all the time.

05:30.719 --> 05:31.685
Let me just...

05:31.686 --> 05:32.786
I'll-I'll get that.

05:34.422 --> 05:37.324
So, uh, Dr. Cahill told me
about your progress,

05:37.325 --> 05:39.125
and...

05:39.126 --> 05:40.326
(growling softly)

05:40.327 --> 05:42.361
Oh, oh, oh, poor baby.

05:42.362 --> 05:43.529
Oh...

05:43.530 --> 05:45.064
Ryan, what's she doing?

05:45.065 --> 05:46.932
You know how creepy
I find menopausal women.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.467
Stop... No, no, stop...

05:48.468 --> 05:50.069
Aw, aw!

05:50.070 --> 05:52.638
Oh... (chuckles)

05:52.639 --> 05:54.341
(contented sigh)

05:54.342 --> 05:56.309
Yeah. Isn't that better?

05:56.310 --> 05:59.011
Yeah. It is.

05:59.012 --> 06:00.513
Why would you...?

06:00.514 --> 06:02.982
(gasps)

06:02.983 --> 06:05.117
Mommy's here now, Wilfred.

06:05.118 --> 06:08.688
So, anyway, um...

06:08.689 --> 06:11.090
I have a lot
going on right now,

06:11.091 --> 06:15.894
so maybe it's best
if you just stay here.

06:17.529 --> 06:19.264
I understand.

06:19.265 --> 06:20.732
It was a lot to ask.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.200
No biggie.

06:24.336 --> 06:27.939
What kind of animal are you?

06:27.940 --> 06:30.475
You would leave
your own mum in here?

06:30.476 --> 06:31.810
You said...

06:31.811 --> 06:34.212
She let a doctor
stick his hands

06:34.213 --> 06:36.548
inside her uterus
so you could live.

06:36.549 --> 06:38.951
So, what, I should
forgive her for everything?

06:38.952 --> 06:42.121
You know, Ryan, for a guy
who once tried to kill himself,

06:42.122 --> 06:44.523
you don't have a whole
lot of compassion.

06:44.524 --> 06:47.059
CATHERINE:
Ryan...

06:47.060 --> 06:49.028
just so you know,

06:49.029 --> 06:52.364
I would turn back time
if I could.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.068
(sniffles) For God's sake, man!

06:56.069 --> 06:58.204
This is your mother.

07:00.441 --> 07:03.344
I-I guess I could reschedule
a few things...

07:03.345 --> 07:04.812
(laughs)

07:04.813 --> 07:06.647
Oh, good!

07:06.648 --> 07:09.282
(sighing)

07:12.920 --> 07:14.821
(chuckles)

07:22.873 --> 07:24.406
(sighs softly)

07:26.542 --> 07:28.143
Good morning.

07:28.144 --> 07:30.311
What happened to my kitchen?

07:30.312 --> 07:33.581
Ryan, don't be such a grouch.

07:33.582 --> 07:37.685
I know how to turn
that frown upside down.

07:37.686 --> 07:41.423
Fish sticks and peanut butter tacos--
your favorite breakfast.

07:41.424 --> 07:43.024
Thanks.

07:43.025 --> 07:45.127
But these days,
I eat breakfast for breakfast.

07:49.066 --> 07:51.968
Can I help you find something?

07:51.969 --> 07:53.703
Uh, let's see--

07:53.704 --> 07:56.806
pork rinds, Funyuns
and a 12-pack of Visine.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.875
I was looking for a glass,

07:58.876 --> 08:00.610
but now I'm looking
for your weed.

08:00.611 --> 08:02.144
What? I don't...

08:02.145 --> 08:05.614
Oh, relax, honey, I'm no narc.

08:05.615 --> 08:09.151
Truth be told,
I've been known to partake

08:09.152 --> 08:12.254
in a little of
the funny tea myself.

08:12.255 --> 08:14.422
(inhales sharply)

08:16.392 --> 08:19.395
I am dying to catch up
on the family gossip.

08:19.396 --> 08:21.764
Is Kristen still
into black guys?

08:21.765 --> 08:24.500
No. Mom, she's been married
to Leo for six years.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.203
Oh, that's right.

08:27.204 --> 08:29.305
Well, it's been harder for me

08:29.306 --> 08:31.274
to stay in touch
with your sister.

08:31.275 --> 08:34.211
Sad to say, she and I were
never as close as you and me.

08:34.212 --> 08:38.082
Even when you were a little boy,
people always said that

08:38.082 --> 08:40.284
you were going to grow up
to be just like me.

08:42.921 --> 08:46.289
And then, I go into the
backyard and see that my mother

08:46.290 --> 08:49.058
has hung all her bras and
panties out to dry on a tree.

08:49.059 --> 08:50.726
What if Jenna had seen that?

08:50.727 --> 08:52.361
Jenna wouldn't have seen that.

08:52.362 --> 08:54.130
Because Jenna's
always out of town.

08:54.131 --> 08:55.564
At least Catherine is here.

08:55.565 --> 08:57.566
She is now, but
when I was a kid...

08:57.567 --> 08:58.700
(mocking):
Waa-waa-waa.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.135
You know what this is?

09:00.136 --> 09:01.470
Let me guess.

09:01.471 --> 09:03.171
The length of my dick?

09:03.172 --> 09:04.807
No, it's the amount
of compassion you've shown

09:04.808 --> 09:06.308
towards your mum.

09:06.309 --> 09:08.343
And the length of your dick.

09:08.344 --> 09:10.112
They happen to be
equal in this case.

09:10.113 --> 09:11.914
Doesn't happen often,
but it's pretty cool

09:11.915 --> 09:13.683
when this shit lines up.
Like an eclipse.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.518
Just because she's
had problems,

09:15.519 --> 09:17.320
doesn't mean it's okay
for her to embarrass me.

09:17.321 --> 09:19.422
(sniffs) What?

09:19.423 --> 09:22.092
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid?

09:22.093 --> 09:24.995
When you talk about your mum,
I hear anger, but I smell fear.

09:24.996 --> 09:26.831
The only thing I'm afraid of

09:26.832 --> 09:29.367
is what embarrassing thing my
mother is going to do next.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.669
<i>Our mum is the furthest
thing from embarrassing.</i>

09:31.670 --> 09:33.204
Our?

09:33.205 --> 09:34.639
WOMAN:
What is she doing?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.073
(laughter, murmuring)

09:37.809 --> 09:39.310
Oh, my God!

09:39.311 --> 09:41.746
What are you doing?!

09:41.747 --> 09:43.481
What does it look
like I'm doing, silly?

09:43.482 --> 09:45.616
I'm making a statement
about corporate greed

09:45.617 --> 09:47.185
and the death of selflessness

09:47.186 --> 09:49.187
through interpretative
movement painting.

09:49.188 --> 09:52.390
This is already
online, isn't it?

09:52.391 --> 09:54.224
Come, join me, my child.

09:54.225 --> 09:56.861
I thought you'd never ask.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.897
Wilfred!

10:00.000 --> 10:06.074

10:15.249 --> 10:17.550
I don't understand
why you're so angry.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.652
Rolling around in paint
in my front yard

10:19.653 --> 10:21.354
in front of all my neighbors?

10:21.355 --> 10:23.822
You don't see how that
might be a problem for me?

10:23.823 --> 10:25.791
Well, after
the hissy fit you threw

10:25.792 --> 10:28.326
about a few dirty dishes
in the kitchen this morning,

10:28.327 --> 10:30.261
I didn't want to get
paint in the house.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.596
WILFRED:
Did Mum complain to you

10:31.597 --> 10:33.697
when you made a mess
of her lady parts

10:33.698 --> 10:35.466
- during childbirth?
- Okay, you know what?

10:35.467 --> 10:37.735
Go get dressed
in some normal clothes.

10:37.736 --> 10:39.236
We're going apartment hunting,
right now.

10:39.237 --> 10:41.572
(knocking)

10:43.475 --> 10:45.376
Surprise!

10:45.377 --> 10:47.678
Hey, I thought you
weren't back until Sunday.

10:47.679 --> 10:50.214
Change of plans.
Is this a bad time?

10:50.215 --> 10:53.084
Well, actually...

10:53.085 --> 10:55.953
Um, I think Wilfred
needs to go out.

10:55.954 --> 10:57.755
Oh, there's my little man!

10:57.756 --> 10:59.290
Ryan, who's the blonde?

10:59.291 --> 11:00.758
She looks vaguely familiar.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.627
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Jenna.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.829
I'm Ryan's mom.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.530
Oh, it's so nice to finally
meet you, Mrs. Newman.

11:06.531 --> 11:08.599
Mrs. Newman is my slave name.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.134
You can call me Catherine.

11:10.135 --> 11:11.235
Oh, okay.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.770
- Hi. Oh!
- Oh.

11:12.771 --> 11:14.138
(both chuckle)

11:14.139 --> 11:15.974
Oh, oh, oh.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.642
Um, let go.

11:17.643 --> 11:18.944
Let-- let go.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.246
Oh, Wilfie, did you
miss your mommy?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.249
Sorry, I have a new mommy now.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.517
Oh!

11:24.518 --> 11:25.985
Oh!

11:25.986 --> 11:29.523
(laughing):
I think someone likes me.

11:29.524 --> 11:31.491
WILFRED:
Mm!

11:31.492 --> 11:34.161
Wilfred, your nose tickles.

11:34.162 --> 11:35.663
(laughing)

11:39.954 --> 11:42.323
And then when Ryan was eight,

11:42.324 --> 11:45.359
I walked in and found him
with his little penis

11:45.360 --> 11:47.995
pressed up against
the TV screen.

11:47.996 --> 11:49.730
More rice?

11:49.731 --> 11:51.298
No thank you, sweetheart.

11:51.299 --> 11:52.800
Turns out,

11:52.801 --> 11:54.968
he was trying to
wanky-wanky to Mona

11:54.969 --> 11:56.403
<i>from Who's the Boss.</i>

11:56.404 --> 11:57.770
(laughing) Adorable.

11:57.771 --> 11:59.238
Oh, that's so...

11:59.239 --> 12:00.205
Okay, Jenna,
you just cut Mom off

12:00.206 --> 12:01.573
in the middle of a story!

12:01.574 --> 12:03.375
- Settle down, Wilfred.
- You settle down!

12:03.376 --> 12:05.577
Sorry, Mom.
Please continue.

12:05.578 --> 12:07.712
Mom, can we maybe stop
with the stories

12:07.713 --> 12:11.583
<i>Oh, gosh, he's upset because
I told the Who's the Boss story.</i>

12:11.584 --> 12:13.485
Don't be so uptight.

12:13.486 --> 12:15.854
Everybody masturbates.
Right, Jenna?

12:17.189 --> 12:19.257
Uh... I have a boyfriend.

12:21.227 --> 12:23.228
(quietly):
She totally masturbates.

12:23.229 --> 12:25.964
Okay, this isn't appropriate
dinner conversation.

12:25.965 --> 12:28.667
Now, where did all this
embarrassment come from?

12:28.668 --> 12:31.470
You were such
an open-minded little boy.

12:31.471 --> 12:35.607
I used to take him with me
to belly dancing class.

12:35.608 --> 12:37.342
Who takes a nine-year-old
boy belly dancing?

12:37.343 --> 12:39.978
I wanted you to be
connected to your body.

12:39.979 --> 12:41.914
It was something
you and I did together,

12:41.915 --> 12:43.415
and you loved it.

12:43.416 --> 12:46.552
Come on, Ryan, come on.

12:46.553 --> 12:49.455
Dance the chicot with me again.

12:49.456 --> 12:51.891
(imitating tambourine rhythm)

12:51.892 --> 12:54.392
WILFRED: Chicky-chicky boom-boom,
chicky-chicky boom-boom...

12:54.994 --> 12:56.628
(laughing)

12:56.629 --> 12:58.397
It's so freeing, Ryan!

12:59.699 --> 13:01.800
(laughter)

13:01.801 --> 13:03.202
Enough!

13:03.203 --> 13:05.371
Why can't you just act normal?

13:07.407 --> 13:10.809
I have to pee.

13:10.810 --> 13:13.711
Does she really have to pee?
I wonder.

13:13.712 --> 13:17.982
You know, you sound
just like your father.

13:17.983 --> 13:20.651
Well, I'd rather be
like Dad than like you.

13:20.652 --> 13:23.921
When I was a little kid, I used
to pray that you'd come home.

13:23.922 --> 13:26.158
And now I'm glad
that you stayed away.

13:26.159 --> 13:28.360
You're crazy!

13:29.896 --> 13:33.232
Well, if that's the way
you truly feel,

13:33.233 --> 13:36.069
then I guess I should go back
to the nut house in the morning.

13:36.070 --> 13:38.772
What? No, I want to keep her.
Ryan, apologize.

13:38.773 --> 13:40.941
CATHERINE: I wish I could
put into words

13:40.942 --> 13:43.110
how I feel about this visit.

13:43.111 --> 13:45.546
I can't, but I will
leave you with this.

13:51.018 --> 13:53.353
Jenna, it was truly lovely
meeting you.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.755
It was nice seeing... you.

14:03.396 --> 14:05.130
I'll just--
I'll clear the plates.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.202
You insensitive prick.

14:10.203 --> 14:12.571
Mommy needs our love.

14:12.572 --> 14:15.408
She's not your murmy.
She's barely mine.

14:15.409 --> 14:17.911
I am nothing like her.

14:17.912 --> 14:20.614
(sniffs)

14:20.615 --> 14:23.050
Tell me something, Ryan,

14:23.051 --> 14:26.788
how old was Mum
when she lost it?

14:26.789 --> 14:28.923
20 years ago--
that makes her...

14:30.592 --> 14:34.929
Well, just a bit older
than you are now.

14:34.930 --> 14:38.265
So maybe you are like her.

14:38.266 --> 14:40.601
That's the fear
I'm smelling, isn't it?

14:40.602 --> 14:42.669
I'm not crazy.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.805
Said the man to the dog.

14:44.806 --> 14:47.274
I'm warning you, Ryan--

14:47.275 --> 14:49.710
she's the best mum
I've ever had,

14:49.711 --> 14:52.312
and I'm not going to let
you take her away from me.

14:52.313 --> 14:54.582
She's going back
to the wellness center tomorrow,

14:54.583 --> 14:55.816
and that's that.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.864
Aw! Aw! God!

15:12.469 --> 15:14.703
Dr. Cahill.

15:14.704 --> 15:17.207
Thanks for meeting us.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.975
Um, I'm sorry

15:18.976 --> 15:21.278
things didn't work
out as expected.

15:21.279 --> 15:23.380
Hmm.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.315
No one's to blame.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.217
It's difficult functioning
in the world, and my mom...

15:27.218 --> 15:29.786
We're not here
to talk about your mother.

15:29.787 --> 15:31.053
What's going on with Ryan?

15:38.228 --> 15:39.828
This belong to you?

15:43.532 --> 15:45.200
Where-where'd you get this?

15:45.201 --> 15:47.668
I found Wilfred
chewing on it last night.

15:47.669 --> 15:49.771
You son of a bitch!

15:49.772 --> 15:53.108
How is that an insult?
I've never understood that.

15:53.109 --> 15:55.577
Why would you write
a suicide note?

15:55.578 --> 15:58.014
Were you really thinking
of killing yourself?

15:58.015 --> 15:59.916
Ryan, we're here to help you.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.318
Your thoughts of suicide
are concerning.

16:02.319 --> 16:04.955
But your eight-page diatribe

16:04.956 --> 16:07.190
in which you accuse
the post office

16:07.191 --> 16:09.259
of, uh, secretly monitoring

16:09.260 --> 16:11.227
the population for the purposes

16:11.228 --> 16:13.396
of mind control--
that's disturbing.

16:13.397 --> 16:14.830
Sometimes the truth
is disturbing.

16:14.831 --> 16:16.666
Take off the blinders,
Dr. Cahill.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.067
I did not write that.

16:18.068 --> 16:19.669
This isn't happening.

16:19.670 --> 16:21.404
- Just wait till Jenna finds out.
- Jenna?

16:21.405 --> 16:23.339
- Jenna? - CATHERINE: Jenna
lives next door to Ryan.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.974
She claims she
doesn't masturbate.

16:25.975 --> 16:27.609
Do you think that's relevant?

16:27.610 --> 16:29.478
CAHILL:
My sense is that Jenna,

16:29.479 --> 16:32.214
masturbation
and the post office

16:32.215 --> 16:34.016
are all crucial pieces
to this puzzle.

16:34.017 --> 16:36.117
I do not have a problem
with the post office.

16:36.118 --> 16:37.986
Wilfred does.
He's setting me up!

16:37.987 --> 16:39.454
He's manipulating all of you

16:39.455 --> 16:40.855
because he's trying
to steal my mother.

16:42.925 --> 16:45.560
Whoa.

16:45.561 --> 16:47.429
He's a dog.

16:47.430 --> 16:50.365
I-I-I know that.

16:50.366 --> 16:53.335
I-I was just kidding.

16:53.336 --> 16:55.237
Well, then you won't
mind me putting you

16:55.238 --> 16:57.305
on an involuntary
psychiatric hold

16:57.306 --> 16:58.840
until I can determine
that for myself.

16:58.841 --> 17:01.443
What? Of course I mind.

17:01.444 --> 17:03.912
Well, the law says that if
I determine that you're a danger

17:03.913 --> 17:06.180
to yourself or to
others, I can hold you

17:06.181 --> 17:08.650
- for 72 hours.
- CATHERINE: I know it sounds scary,

17:08.651 --> 17:11.787
but it'll help you
just like it helped me.

17:11.788 --> 17:14.323
I am not like you, okay?

17:14.324 --> 17:15.824
You can't do this to me!

17:15.825 --> 17:17.292
(sobbing)

17:17.294 --> 17:18.560
There, there.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.429
This is all your fault!

17:20.430 --> 17:22.464
You backstabber!
Eat shit!

17:22.464 --> 17:24.465
Eat shit!

17:24.467 --> 17:26.401
Again, your tone says insult,

17:26.402 --> 17:28.803
but what I'm hearing
is a tempting offer.

17:35.099 --> 17:37.401
Ryan, how are we feeling today?

17:37.402 --> 17:39.169
Aside from the fact
that I started smoking,

17:39.170 --> 17:41.238
I feel pretty good.

17:41.239 --> 17:43.007
Well, you've made
a lot of progress

17:43.008 --> 17:45.309
over the last three days,
and based on years of

17:45.310 --> 17:48.245
diagnostic experience and your
lack of health insurance,

17:48.246 --> 17:50.347
it is my medical opinion
that you are not a danger

17:50.348 --> 17:52.483
to yourself or to others,
and I'm releasing you.

17:52.484 --> 17:55.286
So I'm not nuts?

17:55.287 --> 17:57.422
Look, everybody's
a little cuckoo, Ryan.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.090
The people who
hide it well--

17:59.091 --> 18:00.725
those are the people
I worry about.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.864
Oh, Ryan, one last thing.

18:05.865 --> 18:08.501
Find someone you can talk to.

18:08.502 --> 18:10.202
Thanks, Doc.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.452
Can you ever forgive me?

18:26.453 --> 18:30.289
Can you forgive me
for calling you crazy?

18:30.290 --> 18:32.625
Oh, it's okay.

18:32.626 --> 18:34.260
I am, you know, a little.

18:34.261 --> 18:36.996
Mom, if you'd stayed with Dad,

18:36.997 --> 18:38.999
that would have been crazy.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.036
Listen, Ryan, hope
you don't mind,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.572
but I think I'd like
to stay here.

18:44.573 --> 18:46.441
I like being somewhere

18:46.442 --> 18:49.345
where I don't have to
apologize for being me.

18:49.346 --> 18:51.547
I am what I am.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.715
Me, too.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.122
Maybe you could come
visit more often.

18:59.123 --> 19:01.290
Maybe you can come visit me.

19:01.291 --> 19:06.329
Boy, you really are the
spitting image of your father.

19:06.330 --> 19:09.333
It's kind of hard
to look at you.

19:12.971 --> 19:15.740
Oh, that's better.

19:19.277 --> 19:21.478
So I guess you're
pretty pissed at me

19:21.479 --> 19:23.648
for getting you locked up, huh?

19:23.649 --> 19:25.650
I was.

19:25.651 --> 19:27.685
But now I'm kind of glad.

19:27.686 --> 19:29.754
I think I finally
understand my mother.

19:35.194 --> 19:37.562
So, Mittens, did you miss me?

19:37.563 --> 19:39.663
Bitch, please.

19:39.664 --> 19:42.333
I knew you'd be back.

19:44.661 --> 19:47.003
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

19:47.004 --> 19:49.205
Okay, now I want you
to think of a card.

19:49.206 --> 19:50.706
Got one.

19:50.707 --> 19:52.609
- Good. Now forget it.
- Okay.

19:52.610 --> 19:54.210
Think of another card.

19:54.211 --> 19:56.013
Okay.

19:56.014 --> 19:58.515
Perfect. Now forget
that one, too.

19:58.516 --> 20:00.584
I want you to think
of one more card.

20:00.585 --> 20:02.620
Fine.

20:02.621 --> 20:04.388
- What card were you thinking of?
- Four of clubs.

20:04.389 --> 20:06.658
Turn over the top card.

20:06.659 --> 20:08.627
Ten of hearts.

20:08.628 --> 20:11.029
Keep going until you hit
the four of clubs.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.000
Hey, come back.

20:15.001 --> 20:17.235
I'll show you how it's done.
