My best friend since
we were, like, seven. -Yeah.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.130
- Yeah.
- Wait, didn't you make

01:33.130 --> 01:35.171
those blueberry biscuits
for the company picnic?

01:35.171 --> 01:37.171
- Yes. Yes.
- That... Yeah.

01:37.171 --> 01:39.421
They were technically popovers,
but, yeah, that was me.

01:39.421 --> 01:41.171
Girl, I need that recipe.

01:41.171 --> 01:43.088
I'd be so happy to give it to you, anytime.

01:43.088 --> 01:45.755
I mean, honestly, the biggest takeaway
is that you can use a muffin pan,

01:45.755 --> 01:47.046
that's what I use, but...

01:47.046 --> 01:49.963
if you're really serious
in the popover game,

01:49.963 --> 01:52.088
then the popover pan
can really do some damage.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.796
It helps the batter climb better.

01:56.796 --> 01:59.130
- Brap! Brap! Green tea shots!
Yeah.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.338

or many times,
when they wrestled with anxiety.

03:06.130 --> 03:09.088
My guest struggled with it for years.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.171
- Antianxiety medication was helpful,

03:11.171 --> 03:13.588
but he still felt like anxiety
was holding him back.

03:13.588 --> 03:15.963
Study break.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.088
- Let's get into it.

this Terry Gross interview

04:47.338 --> 04:48.671
with the guy from Americares,

04:48.671 --> 04:50.338

that dangerous thinking

Um, the partners confirmed for 10:00 a.m.,

You can put sour cream in a cake?

11:06.213 --> 11:08.088
Isn't that crazy?

11:08.088 --> 11:09.296
Yeah, what the heck?

11:09.296 --> 11:11.421
- ♪ Go-go ♪
It's baffling, right?

11:11.421 --> 11:13.255
Not just for tacos.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.921
So weird.

11:14.921 --> 11:16.546
What's that stuff around the sides?

11:16.546 --> 11:18.255
That's Cocoa Krispies cereal.

11:18.255 --> 11:20.505
Oh, that looks so awesome.
- ♪ Hit that high... ♪

11:20.505 --> 11:22.796
That wasn't even in the recipe.
I just freestyled that.

11:22.796 --> 11:25.213
Are you one of those celebrity chefs?

11:25.213 --> 11:27.755
-  Oh, no, I'm from Phoenix.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.213
I deliver mail.

11:29.213 --> 11:30.921
You're a mailman?

11:32.421 --> 11:33.505
Jane.
- Yeah?

11:33.505 --> 11:35.671
- Cut the cake.

11:35.671 --> 11:37.963
No. Oh, my...
No, that's for your birthday dinner.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.838
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
I don't care.

11:39.838 --> 11:42.088
- Cut it. Cut it, cut it, cut it.
- What are we going to eat at dessert time?

11:42.088 --> 11:44.421
All right, let's cut the cake.
Do you want some?

11:44.421 --> 11:46.505
I-I could cut the cake.
I'm good at knives.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.130
No, that's okay. We got it.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.546
- Do you have a knife?
Yeah.

11:49.546 --> 11:51.796
- Are you sure or just...
- Yes.

11:51.796 --> 11:54.671
My hands are clean, so don't worry.

11:54.671 --> 11:56.338
- Here, you know what...

11:57.463 --> 11:59.380
- There you go.
Yum.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.713
Mm-hmm.
- That's for you.

12:00.713 --> 12:01.796
Thank you.

12:01.796 --> 12:03.713
Oh, wow.
- Mmm!

12:03.713 --> 12:06.755
This is like if a chocolate pudding man
and an English toffee lady

12:06.755 --> 12:09.005
were making love inside my mouth.

12:09.005 --> 12:10.630
- Thank you.
- It's so good.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.171
I love this cake,

12:12.171 --> 12:15.130
I love this girl and I love sour cream.

12:15.130 --> 12:16.380
Guys want cake?!

12:16.380 --> 12:18.671
CROWD
Cake! Cake! Cake!

12:18.671 --> 12:24.546
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

12:33.588 --> 12:35.838
I will convince Benita to order the Wagyu.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.463
What are those things with, like
the cream cheese? What are those called?

12:37.463 --> 12:39.380
Wait, actually, what about some egg rolls?

12:39.380 --> 12:42.630
No, I can't do concert tickets to Rihanna
for spicy crab.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.880
Wait-wait-wait. Could you throw in
a couple edamame, no salt?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.588
- I'm watching my sodium.
- Um...

12:46.588 --> 12:51.130
If an extra Wagyu seems to fall into
the bag, I can do seats to Beck.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.463
Okay.

12:52.463 --> 12:55.755
Which one of you sent my niece
a blood diamond for her bat mitzvah?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.796
- Are you crazy?
- Hiroshi, I'm gonna have to call you back.

12:57.796 --> 13:00.380
Didn't you see the movie? I...

13:01.046 --> 13:02.713
I took out the gardenias.

13:02.713 --> 13:06.046
I just worked really hard
on that tour idea, you know?

13:06.046 --> 13:07.755
- Yeah.
- But there's no way.

13:07.755 --> 13:09.255
It was a great pitch you put together.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.755
Sorry that Benita didn't say anything
about your deck. That's why...

13:12.755 --> 13:14.213
Oh, it's fine.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.838
Have you talked to Owen again?

13:16.838 --> 13:19.213
No, but maybe it is for the best, though.

13:19.213 --> 13:21.755
- Eh.
- 'Cause he could secretly be a jerk,

13:21.755 --> 13:23.296
like, not do carbs.

13:23.296 --> 13:25.046
That'd be such a deal-breaker for me.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.338
Not be into carbs?
- Yeah.

13:27.338 --> 13:29.338
No, thank you.

13:29.338 --> 13:32.505
Oh, speaking of carbs, that reminds me.

13:32.505 --> 13:35.088
- I've thought about this cake thing...
- Yeah.

13:35.088 --> 13:36.588
and you're gonna start doing it.

13:36.588 --> 13:38.171
- Um...
- On the regular.

13:38.171 --> 13:40.421
Bringing cakes into bars?

13:40.421 --> 13:41.713
Yeah.

13:41.713 --> 13:46.380
I've actually been thinking about it
a lot, and it's a really good idea.

13:46.380 --> 13:49.171
Yeah, 'cause that won't be weird,
sitting in bars with cake.

13:49.171 --> 13:51.296
- Jane?
- Huh?

13:51.296 --> 13:53.255
It's Los Angeles, okay?

13:53.255 --> 13:55.130
Everyone here is weird.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.421
Sure, but...

13:57.421 --> 14:00.880
sounds like you want me to bait guys
with sugar. -Mm-hmm.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.213
Yeah. It's an aphrodisiac.

14:04.296 --> 14:06.755
- Do you hear yourself?
- What?

14:06.755 --> 14:09.505
That sounds like a great way

14:09.505 --> 14:12.713
to get featured on
the <i>To Catch a Predator</i> reboot.

14:12.713 --> 14:16.255
Does not sound like a great way
to boost my law school extracurriculars.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.421
And I get that, I do,

14:18.421 --> 14:21.463
but don't you want to go to grad school
feeling super confident?

14:21.463 --> 14:25.005
Do you not remember how good you felt
the other night?

14:25.005 --> 14:28.671
All those guys laughing at your jokes
about convection ovens?

14:28.671 --> 14:30.380
See, I don't even,
I don't even know what that is.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.046
I don't think that they knew
what that was.

14:32.046 --> 14:33.255
What are you talking about?

14:33.255 --> 14:35.838
They were laughing because
it was a good joke.

14:35.838 --> 14:38.838
I was talking about how convection ovens
distribute heat differently...

14:38.838 --> 14:40.755
- Oh! That's really funny.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.088
That is really funny.

14:43.088 --> 14:47.755
You do this, you will meet all sorts
of guys, all over the city, okay?

14:47.755 --> 14:52.046
Think about it as your on-ramp to...
testing out different flavors

14:52.046 --> 14:55.880
and figuring out what you like
and what you don't like.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.880
- Are you being serious?
- Mm-hmm.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.171
You're doing it.

15:01.046 --> 15:02.713
If you do it with me.

15:02.713 --> 15:04.046
Yes, I'm doing it with you.

15:04.046 --> 15:05.421
Duh.

15:05.421 --> 15:07.296
Do I ever turn down baked goods?

15:07.296 --> 15:09.505
- You do love you some baked goods.
- Mm-hmm.

15:09.505 --> 15:10.880
God, I have a headache. Geez.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.630
Well, aspirin is in the medicine cabinet,

15:14.630 --> 15:16.130
- behind the Q-tips.
- All right.

15:16.130 --> 15:17.963
- Bottom right.
- Thank you.

15:17.963 --> 15:19.963
I really don't think I could exist
without you.

15:19.963 --> 15:22.338
I'm glad we're on the same page
about that. -Mm-hmm.

that at the center of Jane's project

16:37.380 --> 16:39.838

Your dad was a big deal this year.

20:25.421 --> 20:27.463
He was a keynote speaker yesterday.

20:27.463 --> 20:29.213
What?
- Talking about immigration reform

20:29.213 --> 20:31.255
and how to fix the visa process.

20:31.255 --> 20:32.796
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.380
- Well, thank you, thank you.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.796
Well, yeah, Tasha and I,
we're trying to do our part.

20:37.796 --> 20:39.005
Just like Jane will.

20:39.005 --> 20:44.255
Although she's so meticulous,
she will probably end up in property law.

20:44.255 --> 20:47.505
-Okay, here we go again
with the property law.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.005
Oh, that... Is that a joke?

20:49.005 --> 20:51.255
- That's a joke.

20:51.255 --> 20:53.130
When do you take the LSAT, honey?

20:53.130 --> 20:56.421
I want to sit down in August
for a full practice test,

20:56.421 --> 20:58.921
and then study a little longer,
take it twice.

20:58.921 --> 21:00.796
That reminds me.

21:00.796 --> 21:02.505
I called the dean at UC Irvine,

21:02.505 --> 21:04.838
- just to mention you might be applying.
Thank you.

21:04.838 --> 21:06.421
They have a wonderful program.

21:06.421 --> 21:08.671
Yeah, I feel like I'll be applying
to all the UCs.

21:10.296 --> 21:13.505
Huh. I didn't realize
you were so into hot sauce.

21:26.963 --> 21:28.838
Hey, you want some? You want some cake?

21:28.838 --> 21:30.255
Homemade.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.713
Enjoy.

21:31.713 --> 21:32.963
Single lady.

21:32.963 --> 21:35.213
She's single, she's a baker. She made it.

21:35.213 --> 21:37.630
She's a National Merit Scholar.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.005
Enjoy.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.505
The eye patch guy is looking at you.

21:42.505 --> 21:44.130
- Eye patch guy?

21:44.130 --> 21:45.713
- Yeah, the eye patch guy.
- Eye patch guy?

21:47.546 --> 21:48.546
- No.
- Oh.

21:48.546 --> 21:49.671
The eye patch guy.

21:49.671 --> 21:51.838
Oh, the eye patch guy.

21:51.838 --> 21:53.505
Go, go, you have a mission.

21:54.588 --> 21:55.880
Yeah.

21:57.921 --> 21:59.171
Hi.

21:59.171 --> 22:00.338
Oh, hey.

22:00.338 --> 22:02.671
This is a spiced rum spice cake...

22:02.671 --> 22:04.755
that I made.

22:04.755 --> 22:07.130
- Okay, Betty Crocker, let's see.

22:08.421 --> 22:09.546
Mmm.

22:09.546 --> 22:11.838
Mmm! Mmm.

22:11.838 --> 22:14.171
Okay, you do this as a cupcake,

22:14.171 --> 22:17.213
throw some chopped pecans on top,
you got a perfect dessert.

22:17.213 --> 22:18.671
You're speaking my language.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.296
You know, I really don't make cupcakes.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.463
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

22:21.463 --> 22:23.546
- I just did some with buttercream.
- Yeah?

22:23.546 --> 22:25.505
Yeah. You got to pipe it
with just the right tip.

22:25.505 --> 22:26.713
How do I know if I have the right one?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.588
- I'll take a picture when I get home.
- Yeah?

22:28.588 --> 22:29.963
Yeah, uh, what's your number?

22:29.963 --> 22:32.546
- Oh, I'll-I'll give it to you.
- Yeah, just put it in here.

22:32.546 --> 22:33.713
Okay.
National Merit Scholar?

22:33.713 --> 22:36.671
- Yeah.
- Tell me about that SAT score.

22:36.671 --> 22:41.671
So, if we make one cake a week
for a year, count that as 50 cakes

22:41.671 --> 22:44.630
just knowing that we'll probably take
a break for Thanksgiving

22:44.630 --> 22:47.505
and Christmas.

22:47.505 --> 22:50.088
- You have to...
- Ooh.

22:50.088 --> 22:53.796
add a column for results.

22:53.796 --> 22:55.921
- Results?
- Yeah, results.

22:55.921 --> 22:58.838
Like, "Cake was eaten,"
"Cake wasn't eaten"?

22:58.838 --> 23:00.838
No.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.505
No, like, um, like results.

23:03.505 --> 23:05.171
Like kissing...

23:05.171 --> 23:06.880
- Oh.
- flirting,

23:06.880 --> 23:10.421
- touching, getting handsy in cars.
- Oh.

23:10.421 --> 23:12.046
- Like the real results.

23:12.046 --> 23:14.588
- The ones that we're looking for.
- Oh, it's eye patch guy.

23:14.588 --> 23:16.296
- What? He texted you?
- Yeah, he texted me.

23:16.296 --> 23:18.088
Oh, my God, what did he say?
What did he say? Open it.

23:18.088 --> 23:20.463
It's invisible ink.
You have to go like that.

23:20.463 --> 23:21.755
-  Oh.

23:21.755 --> 23:23.546
It's a dick pic.

23:23.546 --> 23:24.755
- It's your first result.

23:24.755 --> 23:27.005
Do you think the recipe is under there?

23:27.005 --> 23:28.921
I don't think the recipe's...

23:28.921 --> 23:30.630
He told me he'd send just the right tip...

23:30.630 --> 23:32.421
Oh, I hear it.

23:32.421 --> 23:33.963
I hear it.

23:33.963 --> 23:35.213
That's on me.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.380
"Just the right tip."

When you're done channeling
the Hadid sisters,

25:55.963 --> 25:57.755
get to my office, Thompson.

25:57.755 --> 25:59.505
Carry this.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.921
- So...
- You need a...

26:08.921 --> 26:10.213
- Um...
- Thompson, you're driving me nuts,

26:10.213 --> 26:13.338
but I'm bumping you up to junior agent.

26:14.630 --> 26:16.838
What?

26:16.838 --> 26:18.838
Shut up. Are you serious?

26:19.588 --> 26:21.630
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.255
Please, please don't get
all snively on me.

26:23.255 --> 26:25.046
Oh, my God, I'm s...

26:25.046 --> 26:26.588
I'm gonna give you
a lot of responsibility,

26:26.588 --> 26:29.755
and plus you'll be making twice as much
as Mr. I Went To Yale out there,

26:29.755 --> 26:31.255
so don't make me regret this, Thompson.

26:31.255 --> 26:33.296
No, no, no.

26:33.296 --> 26:35.296
Absolutely not.
No, you will not regret this.

26:35.296 --> 26:37.380
Give me all the work.
Anything, anything you want me to do,

26:37.380 --> 26:38.963
I'll do it, I love it, I need it.

26:38.963 --> 26:41.130
- Can I hug you?
- No.

26:41.130 --> 26:42.296
No.

26:50.338 --> 26:51.755
No, it was always 7:00.

26:51.755 --> 26:53.171
DAVE
Okay, well, are you sure, 'cause I...

26:53.171 --> 26:54.713
- Yeah.
- Really, I-I...

26:54.713 --> 26:56.338
- You suck, Dave!
- Jesus! Brock.

26:56.338 --> 26:57.963
- Good night. -Bye.
- What? See ya.

26:57.963 --> 26:59.505
What the hell was that?

26:59.505 --> 27:01.338
Yeah, it was Brock from the office.

27:01.338 --> 27:03.588
- Well, at least he showed up

27:03.588 --> 27:05.505
to celebrate my promotion.

27:05.505 --> 27:07.755
You know how important this is to me.

27:07.755 --> 27:12.921
Yeah, I mean, it's like I told him 7:00
so many times.

27:12.921 --> 27:15.588
- Like, he, he always does this to me.
- Mm-hmm.

27:15.588 --> 27:17.671
It's like, get with the program, dude,
you're an adult.

27:17.671 --> 27:21.130
Yeah, but as long as we've known Dave,
he is always late.

27:21.130 --> 27:22.463
It's kind of his thing.

27:22.463 --> 27:24.296
I don't... I don't like
that it's his thing.

27:24.296 --> 27:26.588
It's rude. It's so rude.

27:26.588 --> 27:27.880
It is.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.713
God.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.380
Do we have anything stronger than aspirin?

27:32.380 --> 27:33.963
It's like it's not even working anymore.

27:33.963 --> 27:39.088
Ibuprofen and naproxen also work for this,
so I could run to the store and grab that.

27:39.088 --> 27:43.713
Oh, along with your MiraLAX
for your bathroom issues.

27:43.713 --> 27:46.630
I know I'm old enough
to get over saying "poop."

27:47.130 --> 27:48.588
For your poop issues.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.421
I'll go to the store and be like,
"Hey, you got any poop juice?"

27:52.421 --> 27:54.671
- to really challenge myself.

27:54.671 --> 27:57.630
Oh, my God. Corinne.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.755
Corinne!

28:04.921 --> 28:07.380
Okay, I really feel like
we should call your parents.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.296
No, dude, I'm probably just dehydrated.

28:10.296 --> 28:13.296
Okay, Corinne, you don't have a seizure
because you're just dehydrated,

28:13.296 --> 28:14.713
so I'm gonna give them a call.

28:14.713 --> 28:16.171
Hey, Miss Thompson.

28:16.171 --> 28:20.005
Your CT scan is showing a large amount
of inflammation on the frontal lobe.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.421
You've been having headaches?

28:21.421 --> 28:22.588
Yes, she has.

28:22.588 --> 28:25.005
And you haven't talked to a doctor
about them, right?

28:25.005 --> 28:27.338
No, I just thought they were headaches.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.088
Okay, you'll have to stop driving.

28:29.088 --> 28:31.880
No more bathing or swimming alone,
'cause you could have another seizure.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.088
I'm gonna give you a referral
to neurology.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.755
And, fortunately, we have a very strong
oncology department.

28:36.755 --> 28:38.796
Wait, what? Whoa, whoa.

28:38.796 --> 28:40.130
Wh-What, I'm sorry.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.546
- What?
- What's happening?

29:07.380 --> 29:08.838
Get real.

29:08.838 --> 29:11.296
That doesn't make any sense.

29:11.296 --> 29:13.796
I deal with deductibles for a living,

29:13.796 --> 29:15.921
so you're gonna need to transfer me
to somebody

29:15.921 --> 29:18.713
- who knows what they're talking about.
- Honey, do you happen to have my fly tool?

29:21.213 --> 29:25.130
My daughter's brain is getting biopsied
as we speak.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.796
No, I will not hold.

29:28.463 --> 29:30.130
Oh. Okay.

29:30.588 --> 29:31.880
I'll hold.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.880
Your incision is looking great.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.380
Inflammation has gone down.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.755
Great.

29:36.755 --> 29:38.671
You are going to heal in no time.

29:38.671 --> 29:40.046
Yay.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.463
Thank you.

29:42.421 --> 29:45.296
You can see the mass here.

29:45.296 --> 29:48.421
Based on its location
and the biopsy report,

29:48.421 --> 29:52.630
we would treat this cancer with
a combination of chemo and radiation.

29:52.630 --> 29:55.255
Since Corinne is young
and otherwise very healthy,

29:55.255 --> 29:57.671
we expect her to do quite well.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.380
- Is it too late for Make-A-Wish?
Hey.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.005
- Should I start working on a bucket list?
- Corinne.

30:03.005 --> 30:06.338
Our goal is to stop the tumor
from growing,

30:06.338 --> 30:09.171
or even better, shrink.

30:09.171 --> 30:11.296
We maintain things from there.

30:11.296 --> 30:12.921
So more battle scars.

30:12.921 --> 30:16.588
It depends on a number of factors.

30:16.588 --> 30:18.171
Let's focus on the now.

30:18.171 --> 30:19.713
Mm-hmm.

30:19.713 --> 30:20.796
Okay.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.046
Lunch?

30:27.796 --> 30:29.255
- Um...
Dad, it's fine.

30:29.255 --> 30:30.588
No, it's not fine.

30:30.588 --> 30:32.005
- But it is fine.
- It's not fine.

30:32.005 --> 30:33.671
- Okay.
- Anybody need gum?

30:33.671 --> 30:35.755
We're, we're about to eat food.

30:35.755 --> 30:37.796
I'll take a piece.

30:37.796 --> 30:39.796
Thank you.

30:39.796 --> 30:43.046
Okay, um,
do you want to go halfsies with me?

30:43.046 --> 30:46.296
I'll get the, um, chicken tenders,
you want the fettuccine Alfredo?

30:46.296 --> 30:47.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

30:47.421 --> 30:50.505
I'm gonna get my own onion rings,
though, 'cause I'm trying for a carb coma.

30:50.505 --> 30:52.671
- Uh, wings are back at the hot bar.
- Yeah.

30:52.671 --> 30:53.755
- Really?

30:53.755 --> 30:54.963
You want to get hot wings instead?

30:54.963 --> 30:56.630
- Oh, um...
I'll do a hot wing.

30:56.630 --> 30:58.546
It's Ray, with the Jeep.

30:58.546 --> 31:01.838
He wants to know if we can squeeze him in
for a dent this week.

31:01.838 --> 31:04.963
He says you're the only one
he wants touching it.

31:04.963 --> 31:07.588
All right, well, I think we should
take Corinne back with us.

31:07.588 --> 31:09.880
- What?
Fred, we just sat down.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.588
Let them at least get some wings in.

31:11.588 --> 31:13.671
You don't think we're gonna just
leave you here, do you?

31:13.671 --> 31:16.546
Well, yeah, because I'm-I'm 24 years old.

31:16.546 --> 31:18.296
I'm not, I'm not 12.

31:18.296 --> 31:21.005
We have very good hospitals
in Phoenix, okay?

31:21.005 --> 31:22.546
- We've got a Mayo Clinic,

31:22.546 --> 31:24.046
and I'm sure we can get you set up there.

31:24.046 --> 31:26.755
Dad, this is where celebrities come
to get chemo.

31:26.755 --> 31:27.921
Okay?

31:27.921 --> 31:31.380
Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge,

31:31.380 --> 31:33.213
Sharon Osbourne.

31:33.213 --> 31:36.088
- Sharon Osbourne?
Mm-hmm.

31:36.088 --> 31:39.130
The doctor that we met with,
she's a really big deal.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.505
I'm sure she's perfectly qualified, but
if you're at home... -She is perfectly...

31:41.505 --> 31:43.880
...then your mother and I
can help you stay on top of this.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.421
She'd have to quit her job.

31:45.421 --> 31:46.671
Thank you.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.255
- I thought her job was the pits.
It is the pits,

31:48.255 --> 31:49.921
but it's about to finally get good.

31:49.921 --> 31:51.088
I just got promoted.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.338
- Congratulations.
- Did you know that?

31:54.338 --> 31:56.171
You know I've always wanted this.

31:56.171 --> 31:57.630
Mom.

31:57.630 --> 31:59.630
Look, we just want to do what's best here.

31:59.630 --> 32:01.088
- Yeah.
- Okay?

32:01.088 --> 32:02.671
If we leave you on your own, we can't...

32:02.671 --> 32:05.171
- But she won't be on her own.
- Yeah.

32:05.171 --> 32:06.880
Anything that she needs, I can handle it.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.296
I can make sure that she gets
to all of her appointments

32:09.296 --> 32:13.671
and takes the right pills
and gets rest and all of those things.

32:13.671 --> 32:16.380
Jane, that's really sweet,
but this is going to be a lot.

32:16.380 --> 32:18.255
No, Jane is, Jane is actually meant

32:18.255 --> 32:20.880
- for this exact kind of situation.
- Yeah.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.213
You guys would be leaving me
with a soccer mom.

32:23.213 --> 32:26.296
A carpool-driving, lunch-making,

32:26.296 --> 32:28.630
KCRW-subscribing,

32:28.630 --> 32:31.338
PTA president,
homeowners' association soccer mom.

32:31.338 --> 32:33.380
- I love KCRW.
- She's crazy. Yeah.

32:35.046 --> 32:38.630
How about we stay until you get situated?

32:38.630 --> 32:39.838
Why?

32:39.838 --> 32:41.671
So that we know you're situated.

32:41.671 --> 32:43.671
No, I think that's... that's okay.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.671
- I insist.
No, I...

32:45.671 --> 32:48.130
It's a small apartment.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.463
- It'll be fine.
No, it-it won't be fine.

32:50.463 --> 32:53.213
You're gonna be trying to fix the wall
at, like, 3:00 in the morning,

32:53.213 --> 32:56.338
and interrupt my getting betterness.

32:57.421 --> 32:59.130
What's wrong with the wall?

32:59.130 --> 33:02.046
I thought the landlord was gonna
repaint these walls.

33:02.046 --> 33:04.838
I'll, uh, hit Benjamin Moore tomorrow,

33:04.838 --> 33:06.088
grab a swatch book.

33:06.088 --> 33:07.796
- Did you move my wire cutters?

33:07.796 --> 33:10.546
No, but if you find them,
could you please cut your toenails?

33:11.921 --> 33:13.921
How long were you gonna
let them get, Fred?

33:13.921 --> 33:16.296
I don't know.
Let's give it another week and see.

33:16.296 --> 33:20.088
I'm just afraid you're gonna
velociraptor me in your sleep.

33:20.088 --> 33:22.171
What does that mean?

33:22.171 --> 33:24.088
-  I don't want to know.
Girls.

33:24.088 --> 33:25.963
Did one of you move my wire cutters?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.338
- Oh.
- Oh.

33:28.338 --> 33:30.796
Oh, never mind. I got 'em.

33:32.421 --> 33:34.255
Oh, my God.

33:36.005 --> 33:37.296
We've become a sitcom.

33:37.296 --> 33:39.171
Mm-hmm.

33:44.005 --> 33:45.421
Are you doing okay?

33:47.005 --> 33:49.880
- It's such a weird question, I guess.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.005
As okay as possible?

33:56.213 --> 33:57.880
Mm...

33:59.546 --> 34:02.380
I don't know.

34:03.838 --> 34:06.046
This is all really weird.

34:07.255 --> 34:09.463
Yeah.

34:09.463 --> 34:11.880
Yeah, it really is.

34:13.130 --> 34:15.755
- Hey, if I don't make it...
- Hmm?

34:15.755 --> 34:18.630
will you make sure...

34:18.630 --> 34:22.088
that Lady Gaga starts an orphanage
in my name?

34:23.171 --> 34:27.088
Like... the House for Little Monsters?

34:27.088 --> 34:28.630
- Yes.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.296
I'll look into it.

34:30.296 --> 34:33.088
I knew I could count on you.

34:33.088 --> 34:34.963
Always.

34:41.796 --> 34:43.046
Hey.

34:43.046 --> 34:45.380
Uh, for that machine, it's kind of funny.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.296
You actually have to press down
on the top really hard

34:47.296 --> 34:52.463
and the thing that looks like a handle
actually has to close all the way.

34:52.463 --> 34:54.755
Yep. Yeah.

34:54.755 --> 34:58.296
Is this frou-frou coffee all you have?
'Cause usually I drink the instant stuff.

34:58.296 --> 34:59.796
Right. You know what?

34:59.796 --> 35:02.630
I actually think we kept your jar
from last time.

35:02.630 --> 35:04.588
Just hold on.

35:09.755 --> 35:11.838
- Hey, there she is.
- Yeah.

35:11.838 --> 35:14.630
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:28.338 --> 35:32.755
Oh, I, uh, I noticed that, uh,
there's a scratch on your passenger door.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.630
I'll pull the paint code,
get some sandpaper,

35:34.630 --> 35:36.171
we'll get that taken care of tomorrow.

35:36.171 --> 35:37.921
Oh, my God, Fred, that is so nice,

35:37.921 --> 35:39.963
but I really don't want you to have
to worry about all that

35:39.963 --> 35:41.588
- 'cause I can run...
- Oh, no, no. Janie, Janie, Janie.

35:41.588 --> 35:44.046
Some crook out here is gonna charge you
an arm and a leg for it

35:44.046 --> 35:45.671
and do a half-assed job...

35:45.671 --> 35:47.630
There's my receptacle tester.

35:51.838 --> 35:53.755
Wh-What is this?

35:53.755 --> 35:55.130
I've been baking a lot of cakes.

35:55.130 --> 35:56.546
Yeah.

35:56.546 --> 35:58.171
Okay.

35:58.171 --> 36:01.630
And taking them to bars.

36:02.505 --> 36:04.380
Because...?

36:05.713 --> 36:08.880
Kind of as a way to meet guys.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.213
- But it's not like that, I promise.

36:12.296 --> 36:15.713
"Redwood, spiced rum, dick pic."

36:20.296 --> 36:21.380
Uh-huh.

36:27.921 --> 36:30.463
Ruthie, do you have plumber's tape?

36:35.713 --> 36:38.463
No, that's the... That'll work.

36:39.546 --> 36:42.005
When I'm done with this,
I'm taking this thing home

36:42.005 --> 36:44.088
and I'm hanging it up like my trophy.

36:44.088 --> 36:47.463
Only you would want to keep
your radiation mask.

36:47.463 --> 36:49.546
What? Are you kidding me?

36:49.546 --> 36:52.546
Who wouldn't want to keep
their cancer mask?

36:52.546 --> 36:55.630
Oh, Friday night,
I really want to do, like,

36:55.630 --> 36:58.421
a piña colada coconut cake,
like a giant coconut.

36:58.421 --> 36:59.588
Can you make that?

36:59.588 --> 37:04.505
Yeah, I could, but do you really think
that we should be in bars until 3:00 a.m.

37:04.505 --> 37:06.463
- and eating frosting for dinner?
- Uh!

37:06.463 --> 37:08.546
- Excuse me.
- No, I'm being serious.

37:08.546 --> 37:11.463
Are you trying to crush my soul?

37:11.463 --> 37:14.588
If the Lady Gaga thing didn't happen,
it wouldn't kill me, but this would.

37:14.588 --> 37:16.296
You want... Do you want me to die?

37:16.296 --> 37:17.463
That's so inappropriate.

37:17.463 --> 37:18.546
Do you want me to die?

37:18.546 --> 37:20.088
- Shh, shh, Corinne.
- My God.

37:20.088 --> 37:22.713
I just think your-your treatment
should take priority.

37:22.713 --> 37:26.921
Girl, if I don't have a distraction,
I will literally lose my mind.

37:26.921 --> 37:29.046
I feel like there are just other ways
that you could be distracted.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.130
There are so many card games
that we have at home.

37:31.130 --> 37:32.755
- Jane...
- I really want to take up...

37:32.755 --> 37:35.755
Jane, you said anything I need.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.213
I need this.

37:41.421 --> 37:42.838
Okay.

37:42.838 --> 37:45.255
Thank you.

37:45.255 --> 37:46.921
And I thought of a name.

37:46.921 --> 37:48.838
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

37:49.921 --> 37:51.838
Cakebarring.

37:51.838 --> 37:53.671
- Creative.

38:00.838 --> 38:02.255

38:02.255 --> 38:05.296
Thank you so much, Nora,
for printing out the hard copies.

38:05.296 --> 38:08.130
So, if you look at the schedule,
I divided it up

38:08.130 --> 38:11.046
so that one of us can be with Corinne
at every appointment.

38:11.046 --> 38:13.380
There's also an alternate listed--
thank you--

38:13.380 --> 38:16.838
and there are alternates
to the alternates,

38:16.838 --> 38:18.796
- just in case.
- Yeah.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.921
Uh, what do we do if you have a seizure?
Do we just call 911?

38:21.921 --> 38:23.296
- Uh, Liz.
- I'm asking.

38:23.296 --> 38:25.296
It actually depends on how long
the seizure lasts.

38:25.296 --> 38:26.963
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

38:26.963 --> 38:28.588
I notice that this is super
Western medicine heavy,

38:28.588 --> 38:32.630
and I just feel like it's worth discussing
other modalities of-of healing,

38:32.630 --> 38:36.671
like Reiki, chakra cleansing,
meridian realignment.

38:36.671 --> 38:38.630
Look at this cake.

38:38.630 --> 38:41.505
Let's not forget why we're here,
ladies, okay?

38:41.505 --> 38:42.963
We're here to scout.

38:42.963 --> 38:45.421
Um, I don't want to freak you all out,
but, um,

38:45.421 --> 38:48.380
some old guy keeps staring at us.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.546
Hmm? Where?

39:18.463 --> 39:21.296
It's just more so that we feel like
we're ready to be on our own.

39:22.380 --> 39:23.963
No.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.338
No, no.

39:25.338 --> 39:27.880
I-I haven't even fixed the shower yet

39:27.880 --> 39:29.463
'cause Lowe's didn't have
the right color grout.

39:29.463 --> 39:32.171
I gotta do the-the dryer vent.

39:32.171 --> 39:33.880
That's a fire waiting to hap...

39:33.880 --> 39:35.296
I got a whole list.

39:35.296 --> 39:36.963
I think you're losing it.

39:36.963 --> 39:38.671
I'm losing it?

39:38.671 --> 39:42.838
I'm not the one up at 4:00 a.m. making
spaghetti sauce and doing the Wordle.

39:42.838 --> 39:46.421
You know if I miss a day,
my streak goes back to zero.

39:46.421 --> 39:47.880
Not at 4:00 a.m. it doesn't.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.796
It doesn't reset till midnight.
You got the whole goddamn day.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.796
We can't stay here forever.

39:53.796 --> 39:56.963
Okay, fine, go back.

39:56.963 --> 39:59.505
You can tend to the shop,
and I'll-I'll stay here

39:59.505 --> 40:01.838
and take care of things.

40:01.838 --> 40:04.796
I can't fix the cars, Fred.

40:04.796 --> 40:07.380
Besides, what more can you do here,

40:07.380 --> 40:10.505
besides personally supervise
her radiation treatment?

40:10.505 --> 40:14.505
We know everyone at the hospital,
we figured out the insurance,

40:14.505 --> 40:16.963
and I've filled their freezer
with more lasagna

40:16.963 --> 40:19.130
than they're ever gonna want to eat.

40:19.130 --> 40:21.755
Not possible. I love your lasagna.

40:21.755 --> 40:24.546
Thanks, Jane, but get real.

40:24.546 --> 40:27.838
You girls are gonna need more than dinner.

40:27.838 --> 40:30.588
You guys taught me how to take care
of my business, okay?

40:30.588 --> 40:32.005
This is me doing that.

40:32.005 --> 40:33.296
Let me be an adult.

40:33.296 --> 40:34.630
Yeah, we'll be okay.

40:34.630 --> 40:37.921
I promise. And you guys can drive
from Phoenix whenever you want.

40:37.921 --> 40:40.338
My room will always be available to you.

40:43.838 --> 40:47.255
I'm just not ready to leave you, Corky.

40:47.255 --> 40:50.921
Yeah, I know, but...
for the sake of our relationship,

40:50.921 --> 40:54.505
I can't, I can't see
your bare feet anymore.

41:02.671 --> 41:05.796
Okay, um, pasta salad's in the fridge.

41:05.796 --> 41:09.255
The pharmacy's supposed to call Monday
about Corinne's Temodal.

41:09.255 --> 41:10.588
Got it, got it. Thank you, Ruth.

41:10.588 --> 41:12.838
And I will follow up with you
when I hear from them.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.338
- Okay, thanks, Janie.
- Mm-hmm.

41:19.755 --> 41:21.130
Do you have WD-40?

41:21.130 --> 41:23.296
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yes, we're good.

41:23.296 --> 41:26.130
We have enough for the whole building.

41:26.130 --> 41:28.880
- Um, for your headaches.
- What?

41:28.880 --> 41:30.255
Mother!

41:31.338 --> 41:34.171
Just be careful. It's seven parts THC.

41:34.171 --> 41:36.088
Oh, my God.

41:36.088 --> 41:37.505
Love you, hon.

41:37.505 --> 41:39.088
- I love you.
Thank you for everything.

41:39.088 --> 41:40.796
- Thank you.
Thanks, Jane.

41:40.796 --> 41:42.463
Thank you.

41:43.546 --> 41:46.130
-  Let go. My God.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.046
For you.

41:51.046 --> 41:54.921
Fred, your trail mix and Mountain Dew's
in the back seat.

41:54.921 --> 41:56.255
Thanks for getting us situated.

41:56.255 --> 41:57.838
Bye.

41:57.838 --> 41:59.546
Don't toss my coffee, Janie.

41:59.546 --> 42:00.880
I won't touch it.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.796
Move along.

42:02.796 --> 42:04.671
Thanks for the weed!

42:04.671 --> 42:05.880
Love you.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.296
- Bye.
- Oh, and I'll keep you guys updated

42:07.296 --> 42:08.838
- in our group chat.
- Go!

42:08.838 --> 42:10.713
See you in the fall.

42:11.630 --> 42:12.713
Whoo!

42:13.755 --> 42:16.005
Freedom!

42:16.005 --> 42:17.755
Oh, my God. Sorry.

42:17.755 --> 42:20.671
Oh, God. Sorry.

42:20.671 --> 42:24.380
I just cannot believe that your
parents went to a dispensary for you.

42:24.380 --> 42:28.130
Dude, this is... this is cherry flavored.

42:28.130 --> 42:29.963
Oh, my God.

42:29.963 --> 42:32.755
Oh, my God, I have such a good idea.

42:32.755 --> 42:35.046
Summer is not over yet.

42:44.546 --> 42:46.046
You don't want any more?

42:46.046 --> 42:48.463
I don't think I should have any more.

42:49.463 --> 42:51.046
I'm so high.

42:51.046 --> 42:53.338
Mm, hey, you want some cake?

42:53.338 --> 42:58.130
Full disclosure, it has THC and CBD in it.

42:58.130 --> 43:01.213
Some of us are having
a stronger reaction than the others.

43:02.296 --> 43:03.713
Maybe after my shift.

43:03.713 --> 43:07.671
Just so you know, the frosting,
it tastes like a cherry Icee, or, um...

43:07.671 --> 43:11.046
oh, it tastes like baby toothpaste.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.046
- No, no, no, without the fluoride.

43:13.046 --> 43:14.171
You know.

43:15.255 --> 43:17.338
It's getting late.
I'm gonna call us a car, yeah?

43:17.338 --> 43:18.838
What? Where are you going?

43:18.838 --> 43:20.088
- I'm gonna call us a car. It's late.
- No.

43:20.088 --> 43:21.755
And look, look at her.

43:21.755 --> 43:23.671
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

43:23.671 --> 43:26.046
- Okay, we got to go.
- I've never been so relaxed in my life.

43:26.046 --> 43:29.921
I just, I feel like I'm in a bathtub
and it smells like rain.

43:29.921 --> 43:31.505
I have to go to the bathroom.

43:31.505 --> 43:34.005
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Wait, wait, Dave's getting a car.

43:34.005 --> 43:36.213
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

43:36.213 --> 43:39.505
Hi. My friend's going to the bathroom.
I'm gonna...

43:39.505 --> 43:43.213
Yeah, you have really beautiful eyes.

43:43.213 --> 43:44.755
- Oh. Thank you.

43:44.755 --> 43:47.255
Can I, um, can I buy you a drink?

43:47.255 --> 43:48.963
No, thank you.

43:48.963 --> 43:51.255
Come on, just like one drink, huh?

43:51.255 --> 43:53.463
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Come on, for me, for me, for me?

43:53.463 --> 43:55.338
- No, thank you.

43:55.338 --> 43:57.505
- You're playing hard to get, huh?
- No, I'm really high,

43:57.505 --> 43:59.130
- and I don't want a drink.
- Okay, yeah.

43:59.130 --> 44:00.380
- Just no, thank you.
- But...

44:00.380 --> 44:02.380
- I just said it, like, five times.
- Okay, okay. Okay, I get it.

44:02.380 --> 44:03.963
Okay, you don't have to be
a bitch about it.

44:03.963 --> 44:06.088
- Okay?
- I'm...

44:10.255 --> 44:13.213
What'd you just say to my friend?

44:13.213 --> 44:15.755
I said she doesn't have to be such a...

44:15.755 --> 44:17.171
Shh...

44:18.880 --> 44:21.255
That's enough from you.

44:22.796 --> 44:24.671
Say that, say, "That's enough from me."

44:25.755 --> 44:28.380
That's enough from me.

44:28.380 --> 44:30.755
Goodbye.

44:30.755 --> 44:32.255
Bye-bye.

44:35.213 --> 44:37.255
You know, actually, this is really good.

44:37.255 --> 44:38.421
I know.

44:38.421 --> 44:40.213
But y'all are assholes.

44:40.963 --> 44:42.546
What the hell?

44:43.921 --> 44:46.005
- Corinne.
- Yeah.

44:46.005 --> 44:47.338
You're not a bitch.

44:47.338 --> 44:49.296
I know I'm not a bitch.

44:49.296 --> 44:50.630
Good, good.

44:50.630 --> 44:52.296
Don't let me have any more cake.

45:22.046 --> 45:23.671
Jane, this cake is so good.

45:23.671 --> 45:25.713
- Can I have seconds?
- No.

45:25.713 --> 45:27.505
Did you use yogurt in this?

45:27.505 --> 45:28.796
Yes, I did.

45:28.796 --> 45:30.505
This really works.

45:30.505 --> 45:31.755
Oh, Sam.

45:31.755 --> 45:33.713
This is my brother.

45:33.713 --> 45:35.046
He's here to give me a ride

45:35.046 --> 45:36.213
- after I finish my shift.
- Hi.

45:36.213 --> 45:38.463
Hi.

45:38.463 --> 45:40.505
You've gotta try some of this cake, Sam.
It's so good.

45:40.505 --> 45:43.505
You know what, I could actually cut you
your own slice.

45:43.505 --> 45:45.171
You got a minute, right?

45:45.171 --> 45:46.838
Yeah.

45:53.921 --> 45:56.880
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.505
Oh, my God!

46:02.921 --> 46:05.463
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

46:05.463 --> 46:06.921
That was so weird.

46:06.921 --> 46:08.130
I have never done that before.

46:08.130 --> 46:10.171
- You just made out in public.
- I know.

46:10.171 --> 46:12.546
You just made out in public!

46:15.088 --> 46:17.255
- Look at me in the face.
- Oh, my God.

46:17.255 --> 46:19.130
- Who is she?
- Who am I? Who am I?

46:21.796 --> 46:23.213
You just kissed a boy.

46:25.005 --> 46:29.421
This is not the most sanitary place
to be doing this.

46:29.421 --> 46:32.005
Jane, those are literally toxic.

46:32.005 --> 46:34.421
I don't think it really matters.

46:34.421 --> 46:35.546
True.

46:35.546 --> 46:38.963
You're adding all the grocery receipts
to the list that we split?

46:38.963 --> 46:40.630
Huh?

46:40.630 --> 46:43.171
- The monthly bill that we split.
- What monthly bill?

46:43.171 --> 46:44.796
Jane...

46:44.796 --> 46:47.505
The grocery receipts, the gas receipts.

46:47.505 --> 46:49.546
For taking me to my appointments

46:49.546 --> 46:51.588
and work and everywhere?

46:51.588 --> 46:52.963
Don't be ridiculous.

46:52.963 --> 46:55.713
Don't be rid... I'm not being ridiculous.

46:55.713 --> 46:59.088
You have to learn to charge people
for your services.

46:59.088 --> 47:01.380
If you're going to be a lawyer,
you gotta invoice.

47:01.380 --> 47:03.463
You're not gonna pay me for gas.

47:03.463 --> 47:06.171
You're so annoying.

47:06.171 --> 47:09.546
You should be Judge Judy for Halloween.

47:27.046 --> 47:30.546
Girl, are we supposed to be running
a 5K for you?

47:30.546 --> 47:31.838
Mm-mm.

47:31.838 --> 47:33.296
I'm just supposed to attend.

47:33.296 --> 47:34.421
Okay.

47:34.421 --> 47:36.963
And maybe give some high fives to people,
hand out some juice.

47:36.963 --> 47:39.213
Yeah, all right, when did this happen?

47:39.213 --> 47:42.505
Um, let's see.

47:42.505 --> 47:44.838
Benita filed the paperwork with the city
this morning.

47:44.838 --> 47:47.755
- I'm sorry, are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

47:47.755 --> 47:49.880
I can't really do anything about it, Jane.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.380
I've just accepted that this is how
things go when you have cancer.

47:53.380 --> 47:55.921
People feel bad for you,
and then they get you stuff,

47:55.921 --> 47:58.630
and then you kind of have
to just graciously accept,

47:58.630 --> 48:00.463
which makes them feel a whole lot better.

48:00.463 --> 48:02.588
Okay, you're all set up for acupuncture
at 5:00.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.213
And Jake's bringing
a kind of a therapy dog

48:05.213 --> 48:07.171
that you may or may not want to...

48:07.171 --> 48:09.421
- Yeah, I love dogs.
- Okay. All right.

48:09.421 --> 48:10.838
Thank you.

48:19.255 --> 48:21.505
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:24.171 --> 48:25.963
You work in legal, right?

48:25.963 --> 48:29.421
Yeah. It's a very...

48:29.421 --> 48:32.755
exciting department.

48:32.755 --> 48:34.755
Okay. You're probably really busy,

48:34.755 --> 48:37.171
but if I were to buy you a drink,

48:37.171 --> 48:41.005
I'm wondering if you could
walk me through copyright IP.

48:41.005 --> 48:44.671
Just 'cause I'm applying to law school,
really curious.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.421
Yeah, yeah.

48:46.421 --> 48:48.338
Uh, I track international licenses,

48:48.338 --> 48:51.088
- so maybe we can just start there.

48:51.088 --> 48:53.921
Yeah, I'm riveted
by international licenses.

48:53.921 --> 48:57.338
Uh, you going down?

48:57.338 --> 48:59.671
- Please, I've only just met you.
- Oh.

48:59.671 --> 49:01.130
- That was a really dumb joke.
- Okay.

49:01.130 --> 49:02.963
I'm just going to go report myself
to HR, actually.

49:02.963 --> 49:05.296
- Yeah, okay. See you.
- Um, I'll...

49:08.380 --> 49:10.296
Okay, um, just so you know,

49:10.296 --> 49:12.880
there is an exclusivity clause
in this one,

49:12.880 --> 49:15.880
but I didn't see it in that one,
which may be worth mentioning.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.713
Oh, you are terrifyingly good at this.

49:18.713 --> 49:20.046
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:20.046 --> 49:21.755
I feel like you're trying to take my job.

49:21.755 --> 49:23.421
Ooh, definitely not.

49:23.421 --> 49:24.880
All due respect to the legal department.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.630
Definitely not. I understand.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.630
Wait, wait, I thought you said
you were applying to law school.

49:28.630 --> 49:30.588
Well, yeah, I-I will be applying.

49:30.588 --> 49:32.588
Um, I want to stay in L.A., though,

49:32.588 --> 49:35.671
so hopefully like a UCLA or a USC

49:35.671 --> 49:37.796
- or somewhere like that.
- Sweet.

49:37.796 --> 49:38.880
What about you, though?

49:38.880 --> 49:41.130
You have any plans after this?

49:41.130 --> 49:42.755
Plan after this? I don't know.

49:42.755 --> 49:44.255
- I mean, I'm in the trainee program.
- Oh.

49:44.255 --> 49:46.338
- This is the plan.
- So legal department is the plan

49:46.338 --> 49:48.005
for the next five-ish years, yeah.

49:48.005 --> 49:49.588
- But I like the pace of things.
- Mm-hmm.

49:49.588 --> 49:51.463
- And I like my boss.
- Mm-hmm.

49:51.463 --> 49:52.713
And I like the break room snacks.

49:52.713 --> 49:55.921
I did have one of your dreamsicle
cake slices the other day.

49:55.921 --> 49:57.338
Oh, you did?

49:57.338 --> 49:59.963
Those orangey shavings in the frosting--
amazing.

49:59.963 --> 50:01.421
Well, have you ever zested an orange?

50:01.421 --> 50:03.880
It's just like, pure,
I don't know, knuckle terror.

50:03.880 --> 50:06.171
So, just to clarify, there was no blood?

50:06.171 --> 50:09.380
- Okay?
- I can guarantee there is no blood...

50:09.380 --> 50:10.880
in that cake.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.421
But I'm glad, I'm glad you liked it.

50:12.421 --> 50:13.546
Yeah, I loved it.

50:15.255 --> 50:18.171
Um, do you still want to hear about
intellectual property law?

50:18.171 --> 50:20.588
- To be honest...
- Mm-hmm.

50:20.588 --> 50:21.880
Not really.

50:24.171 --> 50:27.255
Honestly, I'm glad you said no.

50:27.255 --> 50:28.588
But you promised me a drink,

50:28.588 --> 50:30.213
and all I've got so far
is bubbly sparkling water.

50:39.463 --> 50:43.671
All right. Thank you again
for a fun night of contracts.

50:43.671 --> 50:45.546
- Great night of contracts.
- Yeah.

50:45.546 --> 50:47.088
- You're very welcome.

50:47.088 --> 50:48.880
You know,
I've actually learned more tonight

50:48.880 --> 50:52.088
than I would in, like,
the first semester of law school.

50:52.088 --> 50:53.796
Really? I'm flattered.

50:53.796 --> 50:55.838
- Tell my boss that.
- Oh, I will.

50:55.838 --> 50:57.463
Good. I'm glad.

50:57.463 --> 50:59.588
Wait, um...

51:00.838 --> 51:02.546
I actually had a great time tonight.

51:03.630 --> 51:04.963
Me, too.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.005
How's your nausea level?

51:25.005 --> 51:27.088
Um, fine.

51:27.088 --> 51:29.838
Are you sleeping okay?
Yes.

51:29.838 --> 51:31.421
How would you say your mood is?

51:31.421 --> 51:34.546
I'd say fantastic.

51:34.546 --> 51:36.171
Fantastic?

51:36.171 --> 51:37.546
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

51:37.546 --> 51:39.463
Jane just smooched it up last night
with this guy

51:39.463 --> 51:41.546
- that she liked forever and ever, so...
- Corinne.

51:41.546 --> 51:43.338
I'd say it's a pretty good boost
for morale.

51:43.338 --> 51:44.921
Corinne, your parents are on the phone.

51:44.921 --> 51:46.505
- Sorry, please disregard.
What?

51:46.505 --> 51:47.755
They don't care.

51:47.755 --> 51:48.838
Good for you, Jane.

51:48.838 --> 51:51.171
Just be safe, okay? Use a condom.

51:51.171 --> 51:53.255
Oh.

51:54.255 --> 51:55.296
What?

51:55.296 --> 51:58.255
Okay. So when do I get to go wig shopping?

51:58.255 --> 52:00.880
I'm allergic to hair dye,
I've always wanted pink hair,

52:00.880 --> 52:02.755
- so this is my chance.
- You probably won't need a wig.

52:02.755 --> 52:06.088
Most people don't lose all their hair
with this course of treatment,

52:06.088 --> 52:09.963
but you may experience some thinning
as your treatment progresses.

52:09.963 --> 52:12.505
- But I want a wig.
- I already ordered some for us to try.

52:12.505 --> 52:13.588
- You did?
- Yeah.

52:13.588 --> 52:14.755
If they're not pink, I don't want it.

52:14.755 --> 52:16.130
Girl, it's pink.

52:17.213 --> 52:18.713
How's your balance been?

52:18.713 --> 52:21.463
Um, um...

52:21.463 --> 52:26.213
I've gotten a little dizzy sometimes
but nothing major.

52:26.213 --> 52:28.171
You haven't told me
you've been getting dizzy.

52:28.171 --> 52:31.296
I'm thinking I may reduce
your seizure medication.

52:31.296 --> 52:33.838
Is that something
we should be worried about?

52:33.838 --> 52:35.838
Just a precaution
to help with the dizziness.

52:35.838 --> 52:37.796
No need to be concerned.

52:37.796 --> 52:40.171
Thank you. Bye.

52:40.171 --> 52:43.671
You know that Liz saw Adam Lambert
at the 99 Cent Store on Pico?

52:43.671 --> 52:45.088
- Mm.

52:45.088 --> 52:47.213
He was buying Q-tips.

52:50.755 --> 52:52.963
- Is that Owen?
- Yes.

52:52.963 --> 52:55.838
Do you have another date
and you didn't tell me about it?

52:55.838 --> 52:57.713
I don't know yet. I don't know yet.

52:57.713 --> 52:59.671
- He's supposed to call later.
- Whoa, wait.

52:59.671 --> 53:02.505
Oh, my God.
We should get you some underwear.

53:03.505 --> 53:05.046
Look at this.

53:05.046 --> 53:06.755
This is nice.

53:06.755 --> 53:08.796
I am good on that. No, thanks.

53:08.796 --> 53:10.713
Jane, I have seen
your underwear drawer, okay?

53:10.713 --> 53:14.963
It's like the chastity collection
from the von Trapp Family Singers.

53:14.963 --> 53:16.588
- All right?
- Where did that come from?

53:16.588 --> 53:19.505
Three for 25. That's it.
Are you kidding me?

53:19.505 --> 53:21.046
- This is a steal.
- What a steal.

53:21.046 --> 53:22.671
Yeah, it's a steal.

53:22.671 --> 53:24.171
This'll look really good on you.

53:24.171 --> 53:25.296
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, ooh.

53:25.296 --> 53:27.296
- Look, your tatas would fit perfectly.
- You know...

53:27.296 --> 53:29.255
- Oh, my God.
- Actually, not right now.

53:29.255 --> 53:30.963
Owen will lose his shit.

53:30.963 --> 53:32.880
Ooh. You got to get this one.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.046
Excuse me. Excuse me.

53:34.046 --> 53:36.046
Don't you think this would look
really good on her?

53:36.046 --> 53:38.171
- Corinne, can you please stop?
- Look good on my girl, right?

53:38.171 --> 53:39.796
- What?
- Hey, Corinne, I'm being so serious.

53:39.796 --> 53:41.171
I'm your panty godmother.

53:41.171 --> 53:43.921
I'm here to save you from a life
of polka dots and stripes, baby.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.671
Can you not... Can you please
not touch me with all this...

53:45.671 --> 53:47.171
Your undercarriage is dying to break free.

53:47.171 --> 53:48.921
Can you not do...
Can you not do this right now?

53:48.921 --> 53:50.671
- What?
- Can you not...

53:50.671 --> 53:54.296
I'm just m... I'm just messing with you.

53:55.380 --> 53:57.505
- Oh, my God.
- What is wrong?

53:57.505 --> 53:59.171
- Why are you being so weird?
- Are you kidding?

53:59.171 --> 54:01.921
Because I don't need your help
to have sex.

54:01.921 --> 54:03.005
- This is not a sex talk.
- You are.

54:03.005 --> 54:06.046
This is a shopping for intimates
that I think would look good on you talk.

54:06.046 --> 54:08.171
That I would never wear.

54:08.171 --> 54:11.130
So if you would like to buy them
for your stupid large underwear collection

54:11.130 --> 54:13.088
that I get to wash on delicates,
then go ahead.

54:13.088 --> 54:14.755
You don't have to wash them on delicate.

54:14.755 --> 54:16.630
Yes, you do. But why would you know that?

54:16.630 --> 54:19.046
Because you can't even take the lint
out of the dryer.

54:19.046 --> 54:21.713
- I take... Yes, I do.
- No. No, you don't.

54:21.713 --> 54:23.255
- Yes, I do. Yes.
- I do. No, you don't.

54:23.255 --> 54:24.463
It's me.

54:24.463 --> 54:28.963
I do it because you get to be reckless
and I get to clean up after you.

54:28.963 --> 54:31.338
- Whoa, what the...
- And why are we sitting here

54:31.338 --> 54:34.296
talking about underwear
like you're not dizzy?

54:34.296 --> 54:35.755
But you didn't tell me you were dizzy.

54:35.755 --> 54:38.588
Because I don't want to
talk about being dizzy, okay?

54:38.588 --> 54:43.421
Because I don't want to think about
being dizzy because it's gross

54:43.421 --> 54:46.046
and it's boring, and I hate it.

54:47.213 --> 54:49.463
Sorry, everyone!

54:53.130 --> 54:55.838
I just want to have fun,
and I want you to have fun.

54:55.838 --> 54:57.088
- Okay?
- I wish it could be about...

54:57.088 --> 54:58.755
I wish it could be about that.

54:58.755 --> 55:01.088
I wish it could be about fun,
but this is about...

55:01.088 --> 55:05.213
it's about my best friend surviving,
and as your caregiver, it's...

55:05.213 --> 55:08.546
Oh, perfect.
Thank you so much, Nurse Caregiver.

55:08.546 --> 55:10.755
Thank you since I am not having fun.

55:10.755 --> 55:15.630
So thank you for making sure
that everything sucks all the time.

55:15.630 --> 55:17.463
Okay.

55:25.505 --> 55:27.671
I'm sorry, I'm not...

55:30.963 --> 55:33.505
- I'm sorry, too.
- It just sucks.

55:33.505 --> 55:35.046
Yeah.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.963
I'm still going to buy this.

55:45.963 --> 55:48.088
And I'm-I'm going to buy this, too.

55:48.088 --> 55:49.546
You're going to wear it.

55:49.546 --> 55:51.921
I'm not going to wear it.

56:10.755 --> 56:15.421
I think DJ Grandma
is just a really winning costume.

56:15.421 --> 56:17.213
I'll accept the compliment,

56:17.213 --> 56:20.255
but come on,
I'm Terry Gross from <i>Fresh Air.</i>

56:20.255 --> 56:23.005
- What? That's what she looks like?
- Yeah.

56:23.005 --> 56:25.088
Everyone's been saying that, but yeah.

56:25.088 --> 56:26.755
Matter of fact,
I think she interviewed you.

56:26.755 --> 56:28.421
What?

56:28.421 --> 56:31.005
- Gloria Steinem you.
- Yes, me.

56:31.005 --> 56:33.005
You guys, Guns N' Roses.

56:33.005 --> 56:34.463
Guns N' Roses.

56:34.463 --> 56:35.713
Right.

56:35.713 --> 56:37.338
Pleasure to meet you, gentlemen.

56:37.338 --> 56:38.713
They want some cake.

56:38.713 --> 56:40.463
- Yeah?

56:40.463 --> 56:42.588
- Sounds good.
What is it again?

56:42.588 --> 56:45.046
It's a carrot cardamom cake
with maple frosting.

56:45.046 --> 56:46.671
- Could you open that?

56:48.838 --> 56:50.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

56:50.755 --> 56:51.838
No, no, no.

56:51.838 --> 56:53.880
You have to wait at least three hours
to respond.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.130
Let him sweat.

56:55.130 --> 56:57.838
Hey, y'all think I look more like Bono
or MC Hammer?

56:57.838 --> 56:59.921
- Wow.
Happy Halloween!

56:59.921 --> 57:03.463
This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

57:03.463 --> 57:08.005

- I do have a hot take.
Yeah?

57:34.088 --> 57:36.338
The huevos rancheros
are a little overhyped.

57:36.338 --> 57:38.546
They're a little overhyped,
but I'm not complaining.

57:38.546 --> 57:41.463
- No, no, sounds like a complaint, okay?

57:41.463 --> 57:43.671
Some of us basically drink salsa
for breakfast... -Mm-hmm.

57:43.671 --> 57:46.088
...and don't complain about
the egg ranchero ratio.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.338
Can't you see that I'm busting
my ass at the restaurant

57:48.338 --> 57:51.088
and being here doing whatever I can
for you, and you think I don't care?

57:51.088 --> 57:53.171
Yeah, Dave,
because it kind of pisses me off

57:53.171 --> 57:54.505
when you say you have to network

57:54.505 --> 57:56.296
and you're out smoking weed
with the line cooks.

57:56.296 --> 57:58.130
What, are you my mom now?
Jesus Christ!

57:58.130 --> 58:00.171
I seriously cannot deal with this
right now.

58:00.171 --> 58:02.546
Then don't.
Then leave!

58:04.005 --> 58:05.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:15.921 --> 58:17.838
I should really check on Corinne.

58:17.838 --> 58:19.005
Yeah, definitely.

58:19.005 --> 58:21.505
- It's probably best I get going as well.
- Okay.

58:21.505 --> 58:23.255
Let me know if you need anything.

58:23.255 --> 58:25.005
- All right. Thanks for today.
- Of course.

58:25.005 --> 58:26.880
- I'll see you later.
- Mm-hmm.

58:35.130 --> 58:37.463
Hi. It's me.

58:37.463 --> 58:39.130
- Hey.

58:39.130 --> 58:40.588
You all right?

58:46.838 --> 58:49.796
Yeah, I think we're gonna take a break
for a little while.

58:49.796 --> 58:51.421
I'm sorry.

58:54.171 --> 58:55.921
It's fine.

58:55.921 --> 58:57.380

59:26.130 --> 59:27.713
I know I had it. I printed it out.

59:27.713 --> 59:30.713
Just bring it in when you find it.

Even before all this cancer bullshit.

01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:57.505
You carry around
this thoughtfulness and...

01:00:57.505 --> 01:00:59.921
I'm just loud and messy.

01:01:01.546 --> 01:01:03.088
I can't focus.

01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:08.505
You, like...

01:01:08.505 --> 01:01:12.005
you absorb things and internalize them.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:14.796
I don't do that at all. I'm just...

01:01:20.171 --> 01:01:25.130
I should be learning some major
life lesson right now, but I'm just...

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:28.630
just annoyed and ready for this
to be over.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.505

Yeah.

01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:39.046
Will you... you sing me a song
or something?

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:41.296
Can you tell me something...

01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:43.963
- I'm not gonna...
- ...funny or a secret?

01:01:43.963 --> 01:01:47.005
I'm not going to subject you
to my singing,

01:01:47.005 --> 01:01:49.380
and you know all my secrets.

01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:53.588
You couldn't think of a new one?

01:01:53.588 --> 01:01:55.046
Please.

01:01:58.213 --> 01:02:00.088
Um...

01:02:00.088 --> 01:02:02.338
Okay.

01:02:02.338 --> 01:02:05.546
Last month, I ate your, uh,
last slice of pizza,

01:02:05.546 --> 01:02:07.255
the one from Jon & Vinny's,

01:02:07.255 --> 01:02:09.838
and you thought it was Dave.

01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:12.546
- Wow. That's low.
- Yeah.

01:02:12.546 --> 01:02:17.630
Yeah. I even put the box
under the, um, couch like he does.

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.213
It's messed up.

01:02:19.213 --> 01:02:20.963
I'm really a monster for that.

01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:23.338
Yeah, you are.
You started a really big fight.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.630
Tell me another one.

01:02:31.005 --> 01:02:33.463
I don't want to go to law school.

01:02:36.921 --> 01:02:39.630
Jane, everyone knows that.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.755
Except for your parents.

01:02:45.505 --> 01:02:46.963
Yeah.

01:02:48.255 --> 01:02:51.005
Sometimes I wish I was you.

01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:53.380
You know, you're so brave.

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:59.171
I'm not brave. I'm just a show-off.

01:03:06.838 --> 01:03:08.421
I can't.

01:03:08.421 --> 01:03:10.171
Here.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.338
Let's try the cloth again, maybe.

01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:17.296
Is that okay?

01:03:22.546 --> 01:03:26.046
Make sure you take your meds
as soon as you can.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:31.088
Try and take deep breaths.
I know it's hard.

01:03:43.255 --> 01:03:46.213
I can't believe
you actually ordered these.

01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:49.838
What do you think?
Should it be like a... a deeper pink?

01:03:49.838 --> 01:03:51.880
Uh, that depends.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.671
Are you going for vintage Gwen Stefani
or mixtape Nicki Minaj?

01:03:55.671 --> 01:03:57.296
- Huh.
- You know, when she's like...

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.171
- My mom texted me.
- Yeah?

01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:08.463
Yeah. She said that they're going to be,
like, an hour and a half late for dinner.

01:04:08.463 --> 01:04:10.130
What time do your parents land again?

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.505
6:30.

01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:16.546
What I want to know is how we're going
to get out of playing Monopoly

01:04:16.546 --> 01:04:18.505
with the four of them tonight.

01:04:18.505 --> 01:04:20.463
We have a schedule to stick to.

01:04:20.463 --> 01:04:24.880
Yeah, and what I want to know is:
What is happening with these sleeves?

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.005
Like, my arms look so long.

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:28.588
What do you mean?

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:30.005
They're three quarter sleeves.

01:04:30.005 --> 01:04:31.588
What do you mean, what do I mean?

01:04:31.588 --> 01:04:33.463
Look at me in this. I look ridiculous.

01:04:33.463 --> 01:04:35.046
Who would choose this?

01:04:35.046 --> 01:04:36.755
Me.

01:04:36.755 --> 01:04:38.505
It's supposed to look like that.

01:04:38.505 --> 01:04:40.921
You should wear it cakebarring.
It actually looks really good on you.

01:04:40.921 --> 01:04:43.755
Speaking of which, can we talk about
pausing cakebarring for a second?

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:44.880
Why?

01:04:46.546 --> 01:04:48.463
Why, 'cause of Owen?

01:04:50.171 --> 01:04:51.921
Eh, not really.

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:54.213
I just feel like you should be
getting more rest.

01:04:54.213 --> 01:04:55.921
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:57.588
Jane, I'm fine.

01:04:59.546 --> 01:05:01.463
Mm, you weren't fine last night.

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:03.213
Come on, dude.

01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:07.046
I can get through
taking a cake to a bar once a week.

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:09.505
Yeah, I know,
some days you feel totally fine,

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.296
but the places are loud
and people are vaping in your face.

01:05:12.296 --> 01:05:14.963
- Jane, I'm fine.
- None of that can be good for treatment.

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:17.088
I'm fine.

01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:19.796
This is supposed to be a fun project.

01:05:19.796 --> 01:05:23.421
Can we just shelve it
just until you're 100%?

01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:25.671
No.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:28.505
This is way more than just a fun project.

01:05:39.046 --> 01:05:40.588
This is some place.

01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:42.713
May I propose a toast?

01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:47.130
First time we are all together in,
what, three years?

01:05:48.421 --> 01:05:50.255
And Corinne is doing so well
with her treatment.

01:05:50.255 --> 01:05:51.505
- Cheers. -Cheers.
<i>Salute.</i>

01:05:51.505 --> 01:05:53.046
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:05:54.046 --> 01:05:57.796
Corinne, I know everyone must say this,
but you look great.

01:05:57.796 --> 01:05:59.255
Pink suits you.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:01.755
Really? Thank you.

01:06:01.755 --> 01:06:03.546
- Give you that for later on.
No, no, Fred.

01:06:03.546 --> 01:06:05.005
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Fred, don't do that.

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:06.546
- Do not listen to this man.
- Fred, please don't.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.005
- It's his birthday.
- No.

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:10.421
It's not my birthday.
Please give him his card, please.

01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:11.546
Okay...

01:06:11.546 --> 01:06:13.880
No, where, where are you...? Fred...

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.713
Jane has done an amazing job
taking care of Corinne, and we insist.

01:06:17.713 --> 01:06:19.921
Thank you.
You shouldn't have done that.

01:06:19.921 --> 01:06:21.796
- It's done. -ISAAC: Thank you.
- You shouldn't have done that.

01:06:21.796 --> 01:06:24.755
How's everything going
with your cakes, Jane?

01:06:24.755 --> 01:06:26.046
Cakes?

01:06:26.046 --> 01:06:28.296
Yeah, it's fine. It's been good, actually.

01:06:28.296 --> 01:06:31.421
I've been baking a lot
during my study breaks.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.796
I know you've been studying
for a long time.

01:06:33.796 --> 01:06:35.338
You pick out a law school yet?

01:06:35.338 --> 01:06:37.046
No, not yet.

01:06:37.046 --> 01:06:40.838
I am still in the application process,
so we'll see if I get in anywhere first.

01:06:40.838 --> 01:06:41.921
Yeah.

01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:45.046
We can look over everything
while we are here, if it would help.

01:06:45.046 --> 01:06:48.088
You know, UC Davis has that program
in water justice.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.005
Water justice. Yeah, thanks, Mom.

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:53.546
You know, I don't think that Jane
wants to go to law school

01:06:53.546 --> 01:06:56.005
or be a lawyer, really, you know.

01:06:57.755 --> 01:07:00.046
But what do I know?

01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:02.171
Honey, what is she talking about?

01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:03.838
I don't know.

01:07:03.838 --> 01:07:05.380
- Uh...
- Oh.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.046
If I'm being honest, I'm really behind...

01:07:07.046 --> 01:07:08.213
Well, there's still time to catch up.

01:07:08.213 --> 01:07:09.630
...everything happening.
Yep, there is.

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:12.130

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.963
I'm sorry, does anybody want bread?

01:07:28.588 --> 01:07:30.546
Corinne, I have to tell you,
I don't get it.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.963
What are you trying to do?

01:07:31.963 --> 01:07:36.213
Dude, I thought that you were at the point
where you could finally do this.

01:07:36.213 --> 01:07:37.671
Do what, though?

01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:41.630
This is so frustrating for me,
and I'm literally just trying to help you.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:44.171
I can't go out there
and blindside my parents

01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:46.088
and tell them I don't want to go
to law school anymore.

01:07:46.088 --> 01:07:49.838
Really? Because I just ran
the idea by them and no one died.

01:07:49.838 --> 01:07:52.463
- Oh, my God.

01:07:55.088 --> 01:07:56.588
Did she just not wash her hands?

01:07:56.588 --> 01:07:58.838
- She didn't wash her hands.
- That's what I thought.

01:07:58.838 --> 01:08:00.921
Okay, so you want me to go out there
and say,

01:08:00.921 --> 01:08:03.380
"Hey, Mom and Dad, you know what?
I don't have a plan,

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.380
"and I don't want to make the world
a better place like you two,

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.088
but I do want to make frosting."

01:08:07.088 --> 01:08:12.088
Even though, you know the only reason they
let me move here was for in-state tuition.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.963
It's like I thought that this whole
cake thing had worked

01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:17.713
and you'd finally grown a pair,
but clearly it hasn't,

01:08:17.713 --> 01:08:21.255
since you still can't even say
what you want or care about.

01:08:21.255 --> 01:08:23.421
This has always been the plan, Corinne.

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.755
So you're just gonna let yourself
get pushed into this?

01:08:25.755 --> 01:08:28.255
I could think of worse things
to get pushed into.

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:30.921
Okay.

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:33.421
It's your life, Janie. You do you.

01:08:42.463 --> 01:08:43.963
Well, that was nice.

01:08:43.963 --> 01:08:46.046
The singing was a little much, wasn't it?

01:08:46.046 --> 01:08:48.421
Ah, I liked when they did show tunes
at the end.

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:50.380
I love the one from <i>Wicked.</i>

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.630
Corinne seemed tired tonight.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.630
Was it funny what she said about you
and law school?

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.463
Yeah, that was a misunderstanding.

01:08:57.463 --> 01:09:00.296
I think she's just going through a lot, obviously.

01:09:00.296 --> 01:09:04.588
Honey, it's wonderful
that you are there for her.

01:09:04.588 --> 01:09:07.338
Last few months must have
been very difficult.

01:09:07.338 --> 01:09:09.005
We are proud of you.

01:09:25.838 --> 01:09:27.630
All right, next auction item.

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.588
Who's out there who has a teenager at home

01:09:30.588 --> 01:09:33.255
who hasn't looked at you since Christmas?

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.338
Well, I have a little package that's going
to perk them up, and this is what it is.

01:09:39.671 --> 01:09:41.088
Thank you.

01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:44.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.671
Are you here to donate blood?

01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:48.130
I'm afraid not. I'm anemic.

01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:49.505
But I did want to show my support,

01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:51.088
so I'm handing out water
during the afternoon shift.

01:09:51.088 --> 01:09:53.213
- That is really sw... Whoa.

01:09:53.213 --> 01:09:55.005
Whoo!

01:09:57.963 --> 01:10:00.505
- Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:10:00.505 --> 01:10:02.338
I want what he's drinking.

01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:03.963
Yeah.

01:10:03.963 --> 01:10:06.838
Speaking of which,
do you want to hang out tonight?

01:10:06.838 --> 01:10:08.338
- We could get a drink.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:11.380
I just have to drive Corinne back
when she's ready to leave.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.796
- Just give me a call.
- Yeah.

01:10:12.796 --> 01:10:14.921
- All right. See you in a bit.
- See you.

01:10:14.921 --> 01:10:16.630
Hi.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:17.880
What are you wearing?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.338
- Your face.

01:10:19.338 --> 01:10:20.588
- Did you make this yourself?
- Yeah.

01:10:20.588 --> 01:10:21.838
Can I hear it, can I hear it?

01:10:21.838 --> 01:10:23.796
7,500. We start at 7,500.

01:10:23.796 --> 01:10:25.213
Do I hear 7,500? Great.

01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:29.005
No one is leaving
until we hit 20 grand, okay?

01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:32.880
And if you think I'm kidding,
those blockades are here for a reason.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.921
Okay, do I hear nine?

01:10:34.921 --> 01:10:37.671
Hey, runners, remember to grab
a goodie bag on the way out

01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:39.921
and drive safely.

01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:42.088
A lot of people rolled through today.

01:10:42.088 --> 01:10:43.421
That was really sweet.

01:10:43.421 --> 01:10:45.921
I liked the, uh, Foo Fighters
cover band that played.

01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:47.671
Really?

01:10:47.671 --> 01:10:51.463
Yeah. You, uh, mess with their look
a little bit,

01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:55.213
replace the bass player,
they could be the next Kings of Leon.

01:10:55.213 --> 01:10:58.380
I guess. Sorry it's such a trek.
Car's right up here.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.296
Oh, hey.

01:11:01.296 --> 01:11:02.880
Are you good?

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.588
I hate those flowers.

01:11:05.588 --> 01:11:06.671
Those are ugly flowers.

01:11:06.671 --> 01:11:09.588
Hey, you know what? Let's take a seat.

01:11:11.046 --> 01:11:12.755
Will you sit down?

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.338
Talk to me.

01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:21.796
I hated it today.

01:11:24.588 --> 01:11:26.255
I hated it so fucking much.

01:11:26.255 --> 01:11:30.671
Just all those people I don't even know
just taking pictures with me,

01:11:30.671 --> 01:11:33.505
posting about my stupid brain tumor.

01:11:34.546 --> 01:11:35.796
Yeah.

01:11:35.796 --> 01:11:38.588
You know, I don't feel like a sick person.

01:11:41.421 --> 01:11:44.838
And today just reminded me, I...

01:11:44.838 --> 01:11:49.421
I'm a sick person
for people to feel bad for.

01:11:49.421 --> 01:11:52.213
And I just...

01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:55.546
You have cancer right now,
but you're not a sick person.

01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:58.130
You're a person that happens to be sick.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.380
This is just one thing
you're going through.

01:12:02.588 --> 01:12:05.046
And I feel like we're going
to look back on all this

01:12:05.046 --> 01:12:09.838
as that really weird year
we spent in hospitals and bars.

01:12:12.505 --> 01:12:14.171
Really hope so.

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:20.130
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.755
I-I didn't mean to ambush you like that.
I just...

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.088
No, I'm sorry.

01:12:25.088 --> 01:12:27.755
I'm sorry I overreacted.

01:12:30.005 --> 01:12:31.713
I just want to...

01:12:33.713 --> 01:12:37.380
I just want to make sure
that you're going to be,

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.338
you know, okay by yourself...

01:12:40.338 --> 01:12:42.130
...if, um,

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:44.130
- if I don't get better.
- Don't say that.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.463
Don't say that.

01:12:45.463 --> 01:12:47.338
- Uh...
- No.

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:52.838
- Yeah.
- You're going to be okay,

01:12:52.838 --> 01:12:56.546
and when you're the next
Benita big shot agent,

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:59.713
everyone's going to be like, "Oh, my God,
did you know that Corinne had cancer?

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.255
She's such a rock star,
you can't even tell."

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:10.213
"I heard she was in Cancun with The Weeknd

01:13:10.213 --> 01:13:13.005
after she finished her chemo."

01:13:13.005 --> 01:13:16.880
"Well, you know, I heard that Mick Jagger
named an essential oils line after her

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.546
in spite of it being
an already saturated market."

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:26.130
That was a good one, by the way.
I love Mick Jagger.

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:27.380
I know you do.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.921
You never let me forget
how much you love Mick Jagger.

01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:33.255
- You know that's my boy.
- That's your boy.

01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:42.380
Hi. Okay, what's going on?

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.213
Okay, lie down, lie down.

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:49.088
Something's wrong.

01:13:50.421 --> 01:13:52.713
What month is it?

01:13:52.713 --> 01:13:54.880
It's November.

01:13:57.005 --> 01:13:58.755
What day is it?

01:13:58.755 --> 01:14:00.796
It's the fifth. It's a Sunday.

01:14:00.796 --> 01:14:02.880
- Oh.

01:14:04.546 --> 01:14:06.880
- I missed your birthday?
- No.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.296
No, uh, we went to the reservoir
and you made us a picnic.

01:14:11.296 --> 01:14:12.921
I'll-I'll be right back.

01:14:12.921 --> 01:14:14.296
Hi. Um, excuse me.

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:16.088
My friend was supposed to be seen
hours ago.

01:14:16.088 --> 01:14:17.338
Sorry. It's a crazy night.

01:14:17.338 --> 01:14:20.171
No, I know, but she's being treated
in this hospital for a brain tumor.

01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:21.546
Her name is Corinne Thompson.

01:14:21.546 --> 01:14:23.213
We're doing the best we can.

01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:25.255
Okay, um...

01:14:25.255 --> 01:14:27.671
Her oncologist is-is Dr. Mitchell.

01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:29.421
Could you just check to see who's on call?

01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:32.213
If it's a fellow, a resident,
anybody in her primary care team.

01:14:32.213 --> 01:14:34.213
She's acting like she has amnesia.

01:14:34.213 --> 01:14:36.296
She's never done this before.

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.005
I'll see what I can do.

01:14:39.005 --> 01:14:40.338
Okay.

01:14:43.088 --> 01:14:44.838
Okay, okay.

01:14:51.213 --> 01:14:53.213
Hi. I'm sorry, sorry about that.

01:14:53.213 --> 01:14:55.255
I just had to check on something.

01:14:55.255 --> 01:14:57.338
Is there anything I could get you?

01:14:57.338 --> 01:15:00.713
I could rustle up some really stale chips
from the vending machine.

01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:06.130
What happened?

01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:07.838
I don't know.

01:15:07.838 --> 01:15:10.963
It could be a reaction
from your new chemo pills.

01:15:10.963 --> 01:15:13.088
Chemo pills?

01:15:15.296 --> 01:15:16.463
Wait.

01:15:24.546 --> 01:15:26.046
What month is it?

01:15:26.046 --> 01:15:28.796
It's November.

01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:30.671
No, what day is it?

01:15:30.671 --> 01:15:33.088
It's the fifth. It's a Sunday.

01:15:33.088 --> 01:15:35.213
I missed your birthday.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.463
You never miss my birthday.

01:15:39.463 --> 01:15:40.921
We spent it together.

01:15:40.921 --> 01:15:43.296
We had a really good day.

01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:48.213
Why are we at the hospital?

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.130
You okay?

01:15:54.505 --> 01:15:56.046
I'm okay.

01:16:00.171 --> 01:16:01.671
I'm okay.

01:16:03.255 --> 01:16:04.671
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:16:04.671 --> 01:16:05.880
Good morning.
Hi.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.671
I like seeing you guys all together.

01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:08.921
Yeah.

01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:10.838
How are you doing, Corinne?
How'd you sleep?

01:16:10.838 --> 01:16:12.130
I'm fine.

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:14.630
Uh, the...
these sheets are so loud, though.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:16.463
You don't love these waterproof sheets?
They're not...?

01:16:16.463 --> 01:16:17.755
- No.
- No?

01:16:17.755 --> 01:16:20.130
I'm not going to piss myself, I swear.

01:16:23.088 --> 01:16:26.713
So, I... I got the results
of Corinne's MRI.

01:16:26.713 --> 01:16:28.088
Uh-oh.

01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:29.671
Pregnant?

01:16:29.671 --> 01:16:32.171
- Hey, come on.

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.963
It's not what we were hoping for.

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:40.880
The tumor has appeared
in a new location as a glioblastoma.

01:16:42.255 --> 01:16:45.338
Glioblastomas are very aggressive.

01:16:45.338 --> 01:16:49.671
More treatments for brain cancer
are coming out all the time, but...

01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:53.921
...there is no cure for this
particular tumor right now.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.463
Okay, I'm, um...

01:17:01.463 --> 01:17:03.171
I'm sorry. What do we do next?

01:17:03.171 --> 01:17:07.963
Because of the location,
surgery is still not a viable option.

01:17:07.963 --> 01:17:11.046
- Okay.
- But...

01:17:11.046 --> 01:17:12.880
Corinne could be eligible
for a clinical trial.

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:18.088
I have a list of hospitals
that are currently accepting patients.

01:17:19.421 --> 01:17:21.546
Wait...

01:17:22.921 --> 01:17:25.296
Are you saying that we're-we're...

01:17:25.296 --> 01:17:27.130
we're done here?

01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:30.130
We're not done.
She said, she said there's a list.

01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:31.421
- We're not done.
We...

01:17:31.421 --> 01:17:33.921
We can make some calls first.

01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:36.213
You know what? We'll make the calls.
Just give us the list.

01:17:36.213 --> 01:17:38.130
Why are we just now hearing about a list?

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.546
Why are we not already on the list?

01:17:39.546 --> 01:17:41.171
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thompson.

01:17:41.171 --> 01:17:43.213
Cancer is never a straight line.

01:17:43.213 --> 01:17:44.755
There are so many ups and downs.

01:17:44.755 --> 01:17:47.338
Yeah, no, I don't need
a straight line. I need a straight answer.

01:17:47.338 --> 01:17:50.421
Now, where was this list three months ago
when we first met you?

01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:52.213
I wish I had a better answer for you.

01:17:52.213 --> 01:17:54.671
She could still get into Houston.

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:57.796
Dallas could take her next week
if her samples are a match.

01:17:57.796 --> 01:17:59.380
This isn't us giving up.

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.796
We should have brought her home, Ruth.

01:18:01.796 --> 01:18:03.296
We should have done the Mayo Clinic.

01:18:03.296 --> 01:18:05.130
We could have gone
to all the appointments.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.755
We could have managed her care.

01:18:06.755 --> 01:18:08.171
We could have been there for all of it,

01:18:08.171 --> 01:18:11.213
not just emailing her articles
about electrolytes.

01:18:12.505 --> 01:18:14.296
We don't know that she'd be better.

01:18:14.296 --> 01:18:15.921
She could still be just as sick,

01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:18.046
but she would hate us
for making her leave.

01:18:18.046 --> 01:18:20.046
Well, we won't know.

01:18:21.713 --> 01:18:24.171
You convinced me that she'd be fine.

01:18:25.838 --> 01:18:28.213
She isn't going to be fine, Ruth.

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:35.046
It wasn't our decision to make.

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:40.255
I have to pick up her Keppra
before the pharmacy closes.

01:18:54.921 --> 01:18:56.755
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.588
- Can I come in?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:00.588 --> 01:19:02.588
Great.

01:19:02.588 --> 01:19:04.796
I need to sleep with you.
Are you okay with that?

01:19:04.796 --> 01:19:07.505
I was not expecting that. Yeah, yeah.

01:19:07.505 --> 01:19:09.630
- Can I get you a drink?
- Couch or bed?

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:10.921
- Oh, you mean now?
- Yeah.

01:19:10.921 --> 01:19:12.338
- Uh...
- Bed?

01:19:12.338 --> 01:19:13.755
- Bed?
- I like bed.

01:19:20.921 --> 01:19:22.171
Hey.

01:19:22.171 --> 01:19:23.296
Hmm?

01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:24.546
You okay?

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.005
Not really.

01:19:27.005 --> 01:19:29.088
Life's a little weird,
but if you're asking

01:19:29.088 --> 01:19:32.546
whether I'm a sober
and consenting adult, absolutely.

01:19:32.546 --> 01:19:34.546
- You?
- Yeah.

01:19:34.546 --> 01:19:36.213
Okay, good.

01:19:40.505 --> 01:19:42.380
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.546
Hey.

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:45.713
Uh...

01:19:45.713 --> 01:19:49.796
thought you could use this instant
like you like.

01:19:52.796 --> 01:19:54.671
- Thanks, Janie.
- Yeah.

01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:02.838
I know you're upset
Corinne didn't come to Phoenix with you.

01:20:04.755 --> 01:20:06.296
And I'm so sorry.

01:20:07.671 --> 01:20:09.630
I really never thought
we'd get to this point.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.880
I really thought I could handle it.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.713
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

01:20:14.796 --> 01:20:16.255
Of course you didn't.

01:20:17.338 --> 01:20:20.338
None of us, none of us wanted
to think that.

01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:24.921
Hell, I-I thought the biggest problem
would be the carpet.

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:30.713
Or the mold in your shower pan
or the faulty GFI.

01:20:30.713 --> 01:20:32.255
I can fix those.

01:20:33.713 --> 01:20:36.171
But, uh...

01:20:37.505 --> 01:20:40.755
Oh, this cancer business is not...

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:45.213
...not something you or I
can do anything about, is it?

01:20:45.213 --> 01:20:46.546
No.

01:20:53.296 --> 01:20:56.838
And I-I just needed something
to be mad at.

01:20:58.046 --> 01:20:59.796
I'm not mad at you.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.088
Thanks.

01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:08.921
Mmm...

01:21:08.921 --> 01:21:12.546
Yeah. I think you're overdue
for a change of scenery.

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:14.838
Well, I don't know.

01:21:14.838 --> 01:21:17.046
My car keys are all the way upstairs.

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.880
I have mine.

01:21:26.588 --> 01:21:28.213
Wow.

01:21:28.213 --> 01:21:30.338
Fred, you're really good at this.

01:21:30.338 --> 01:21:33.546
You know, I'm an auto body guy.

01:21:33.546 --> 01:21:35.296
Glaze coat's a glaze coat.

01:21:35.296 --> 01:21:38.421
Any suggestions
on how to take this corner?

01:21:39.421 --> 01:21:42.713
I mean, you can round it off
or commit to that point.

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:46.463
I was thinking of rounding it,
but might as well commit to the point.

01:21:48.296 --> 01:21:50.046
Committing to the point.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:30.880
Ugh.
Hmm?

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.588
The art in here is so ugly.

01:22:33.588 --> 01:22:36.380
Yeah, it is pretty bad.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:39.005
It's... it's Wednesday, right?
Yeah.

01:22:39.005 --> 01:22:41.880
How long have I,
how long have I been here again?

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.338
RUTH and JANE:
Three days.

01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:44.963
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.421
Jane? Jane?
- Yeah?

01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:34.421
Oh, my... Okay, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

01:23:35.671 --> 01:23:37.755
Let's go get fries.

01:23:37.755 --> 01:23:39.588
Oh, okay.

01:23:39.588 --> 01:23:41.088
- Come on.
- Yeah, let's get fries.

01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:44.046
So there's this super famous
French fry stand

01:23:44.046 --> 01:23:46.921
in, um, Rio de Janeiro.

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:51.921
It's apparently like the best French fries
in the world.

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.671
So I was thinking...

01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:59.880
...that we could put in for a vacation
at the same time

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.505
and maybe go next summer.

01:24:02.546 --> 01:24:04.046
- I'm down.
- Right?

01:24:04.046 --> 01:24:06.588
- Just have to renew our passports.
- Oh, yeah.

01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:08.255
Can't get by with those photos.

01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:12.213
I just don't want to roll in
with a picture of me at 12,

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:13.921
- like, "Let me in, please."
- Yeah. No, thank you.

01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:21.963
Did you know that Russell and I
had our first date here?

01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:25.380
Russell, the tennis coach?

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.796
- My tennis coach.
- Yeah.

01:24:26.796 --> 01:24:29.588
- With the... Mm-hmm.
- The tiny shorts.

01:24:29.588 --> 01:24:31.380
Oh, my God.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:34.088
- His shorts were so small.
- I know.

01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:37.046
I saw he just had a baby.

01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:41.005
It's probably pretty easy
with those shorts.

01:24:42.088 --> 01:24:43.338
Slide 'em to the side.

01:24:44.463 --> 01:24:47.213
Time out. Time out.

01:24:48.338 --> 01:24:50.088
Sorry.

01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:27.338
Oh. Thanks, Jane.

01:25:27.338 --> 01:25:28.755
Of course.

01:25:31.838 --> 01:25:33.588
They said it could have been worse.

01:25:33.588 --> 01:25:36.796
They're going to readmit her
and keep her for longer.

01:25:38.421 --> 01:25:41.838
What if she gets into one of those trials,
could she leave?

01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:47.130
Um, the Houston one called today
and she's not a match.

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:51.213
And then, uh, the other ones,
we were either too late applying

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:54.463
or her tumor is too far advanced.

01:25:56.338 --> 01:26:01.005
Um, so Houston was our last hope.

01:26:14.213 --> 01:26:17.421
Do you remember when she wanted
to get that tattoo?

01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:19.630
The one that had the record player?

01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:24.921
Yeah. You said that if she waited
until she was 20 that you'd get her a car.

01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.838
And then I just took her to get it anyway.

01:26:27.838 --> 01:26:30.213
Yeah, you totally caved.

01:26:31.296 --> 01:26:34.713
To be honest,
I think it looks really good.

01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.796
You know, she's really lucky
to have you as her mom.

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:43.380
I don't know.

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:46.505
I'm really lucky she came along.

01:26:46.505 --> 01:26:49.463
I never thought I'd have so much fun.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.005
Me, either.

01:27:40.796 --> 01:27:42.713
DÌ LANG
I wish you were in my kitchen with me.

01:27:42.713 --> 01:27:45.463
It's so delicious.

01:27:45.463 --> 01:27:47.213
Now, if you have your folks coming in,
you got the...

01:27:53.755 --> 01:27:54.880
Okay.

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:00.463
Let's get to it.

01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:18.796
Good, you are awake.

01:28:18.796 --> 01:28:20.213
I can't sleep.

01:28:20.213 --> 01:28:21.880
These sheets are still so loud.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.755
It's a pumpkin pie cake.

01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:27.046
Wow.

01:28:27.046 --> 01:28:28.421
How are you doing?

01:28:28.421 --> 01:28:29.963
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:31.463 --> 01:28:34.380
I'm, uh...

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.088
doing pretty good, you know.

01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:37.213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.213 --> 01:28:39.921
Definitely having an existential crisis
right now.

01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:41.421
Sounds about right.

01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:43.546
You in any pain, though?

01:28:43.546 --> 01:28:45.005
- Anything I can get you?
- No.

01:28:45.005 --> 01:28:46.796
- You promise?
- Yeah.

01:28:49.963 --> 01:28:51.921
Okay, give me an update.

01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.255
We have 17 cakes left.

01:28:54.255 --> 01:28:55.963
I know that.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:58.880
So you also know that I'm going to finish
cakebarring for us.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.921
Hell yeah.

01:29:00.921 --> 01:29:03.546
I said 50 cakes,
so I'm gonna do 50 cakes.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:05.046
Good.

01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.713
Wish I could go with you.

01:29:08.713 --> 01:29:10.255
Oh, you are.

01:29:10.255 --> 01:29:12.380

I brought more cakebarring souvenirs.

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:55.671

- Love the Abbey.
- Oh, I have more.

01:29:57.171 --> 01:29:59.505
This is what I got from the Edison.

01:29:59.505 --> 01:30:01.671
Girl, you stole a menu from the Edison?

01:30:04.088 --> 01:30:07.130
Okay, that's a safety hazard, guys.
That's a safety hazard.

01:30:09.088 --> 01:30:12.171

Rams bobblehead from Sunday's game,

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:29.921
which I traded
for a molten chocolate beer cake.

01:30:29.921 --> 01:30:32.380
Tiny pencils from Los Globos,

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.421
'cause Alex forced me to go
to trivia night with her.

01:30:35.421 --> 01:30:37.796
- Let me guess, she won.
- Won by landslide.

01:30:37.796 --> 01:30:39.546
And then... Right.

01:30:39.546 --> 01:30:42.796
A photo strip from Liz's office's
Christmas party

01:30:42.796 --> 01:30:44.421
where everyone was gluten free.

01:30:44.421 --> 01:30:47.380
Which means I have an entire eggnog cake
with your name on it

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.713
in the fridge when we get home.

01:30:48.713 --> 01:30:51.005
Okay, that should do it.

01:30:51.005 --> 01:30:52.421
You ready to go home?

01:30:52.421 --> 01:30:53.505
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:30:53.505 --> 01:30:54.796
Let's ride.

01:30:54.796 --> 01:30:57.005
After weeks in the hospital,

01:30:57.005 --> 01:30:59.213
you must be ready for my lasagna.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.421
Goodbye, room.

01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:05.630
That is some ugly-ass art on the wall.

01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:07.921
That's exactly what I said.

01:31:09.213 --> 01:31:11.588
You see what I mean about the primer?

01:31:11.588 --> 01:31:13.088
Yeah.

01:31:13.088 --> 01:31:18.005
I like to put it on, like, more here,
matte, so it doesn't crease,

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.213
'cause I don't, I don't like
when it creases.

01:31:20.213 --> 01:31:21.505
Okay, how do I do that?

01:31:21.505 --> 01:31:23.046
The fluffy brush.

01:31:24.505 --> 01:31:28.171
Got you. Got to matte it.

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:32.213
- Jane.
- Huh?

01:31:32.213 --> 01:31:34.171
Give me that.

01:31:34.171 --> 01:31:35.421
Yeah.

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.296
What am I missing?

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.005
This is for blush.

01:31:44.005 --> 01:31:47.463
Okay, sure,
but it was the fluffiest one here.

01:31:47.463 --> 01:31:48.880
Got the whole job done, right?

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.338
You saw how fast I did that.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.338
Fluffiest eye brush.

01:31:52.338 --> 01:31:54.421
Okay, since we're getting technical.

01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:55.796
- Fluffy brush.

01:31:55.796 --> 01:31:59.130
Once we get good at this,
then Owen will be so focused on your eyes,

01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:01.046
he'll forget about
your terrible underwear.

01:32:02.505 --> 01:32:05.505
You are such an underwear bully.

01:32:07.963 --> 01:32:10.255
Please just take mine.

01:32:10.255 --> 01:32:11.671
Please.

01:32:11.671 --> 01:32:13.880
I don't want them to just be thrown away.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.296
You can even have this one.

01:32:16.796 --> 01:32:18.505
My favorite.

01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:20.921
Are you wearing underwire right now?

01:32:20.921 --> 01:32:22.380
Stretch lace.

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.671
Okay.

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.588
Extremely comfortable.

01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:29.380
What's happening with you and Owen?

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:36.171
We're at that point where it's like,
are we going on dates or are we dating?

01:32:36.171 --> 01:32:38.046
What do you want?

01:32:38.046 --> 01:32:40.421
Yeah, he's a good guy

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:43.671
and we have...
we have a good time together,

01:32:43.671 --> 01:32:45.713
but I just think that when I met him,

01:32:45.713 --> 01:32:48.588
I really, really wanted him to like me.

01:32:48.588 --> 01:32:51.171
But more so as a way to...

01:32:51.171 --> 01:32:55.588
to prove that I could be liked, er, um,
so I could like myself.

01:32:55.588 --> 01:32:57.421
Oh, my God, is that so dumb?

01:32:57.421 --> 01:33:00.963
No, it's part of evolving
and learning who you are.

01:33:00.963 --> 01:33:05.921
Makes me happy to see you going out
and doing what you want.

01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:07.421
Yeah.

01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:10.921
You know, finding what makes you happy.

01:33:12.713 --> 01:33:16.255
Now I just have to figure out what I want.

01:33:16.255 --> 01:33:19.963
Are you sure that eyeshadow's
what you want?

01:33:21.046 --> 01:33:23.380
I don't know if burnt orange is my color.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.171
It's not.

01:33:25.171 --> 01:33:26.671
Yeah.

01:33:26.671 --> 01:33:30.630
What?

01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:35.755
I can't.

01:33:35.755 --> 01:33:37.130
TASHA
Oh, one more thing, honey.

01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.130
We wanted to fill you in
on our summer plans.

01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:41.130
We are thinking we will do
some, uh, consulting

01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:42.671
in Nay Pyi Taw for two weeks,

01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:45.713
and then, uh, we go to Vang Vieng
for a week at the end.

01:33:45.713 --> 01:33:47.838
Oh, that sounds great.

01:33:47.838 --> 01:33:49.171
You should come with us, sweetie.

01:33:49.171 --> 01:33:51.296
Get a change of scenery
before you go off to school.

01:33:52.463 --> 01:33:54.921
You know, actually, there's...

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.505
Actually, there's something
that we should talk about.

01:33:57.505 --> 01:34:03.255
And I'm so sorry because
I should have said this sooner, but...

01:34:03.255 --> 01:34:05.921
I'm not going to law school.

01:34:05.921 --> 01:34:07.505
TASHA and ISAAC:
What?

01:34:07.505 --> 01:34:11.921
I mean, I mean, you are not going now
or you are not going ever?

01:34:11.921 --> 01:34:15.130
It's just not something I'd be good at

01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:18.005
because it's not something I'd enjoy.

01:34:18.005 --> 01:34:22.213
And for the longest time, I thought
it was the only thing that I could do,

01:34:22.213 --> 01:34:24.505
and I wanted to make you guys happy.

01:34:24.505 --> 01:34:25.671
Oh, Jane.

01:34:25.671 --> 01:34:27.463
Please don't say
you want to be an actress.

01:34:27.463 --> 01:34:29.338
God, no.

01:34:29.338 --> 01:34:31.213
Whoo, not an actress.

01:34:31.213 --> 01:34:34.380
But I do feel like I can do what I want
and still make a difference.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.296
With a law degree,
you can do whatever you want.

01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:38.671

I have a question, though.

Are you gonna get up there and sing?

01:35:25.796 --> 01:35:27.046
Oh, God, no.

01:35:27.046 --> 01:35:28.296
- No?
- No.

01:35:28.296 --> 01:35:29.546

01:35:29.546 --> 01:35:32.088
Oh, I also can't sing,
so I'm not making my debut.

01:35:32.088 --> 01:35:33.213
- Hey, yo, Janie.
- Yes.

01:35:33.213 --> 01:35:34.463
When are we going cakebarring, huh?

01:35:34.463 --> 01:35:36.130
- Cakebarring?
Yeah.

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.921
- What is that?
- Oh.

01:35:37.921 --> 01:35:39.005
Oh, it's kind of in the name.

01:35:39.005 --> 01:35:42.130
I basically just bring my cakes to a bar
as a way to meet people.

01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:45.588
So all the cake I've been eating
is just leftovers

01:35:45.588 --> 01:35:47.838

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:59.213
Ooh, do you want to do something
this weekend?

01:38:59.213 --> 01:39:01.755
I was thinking margaritas
at Casita del Campo,

01:39:01.755 --> 01:39:04.380
but, you know,
I understand if you're too busy.

01:39:05.463 --> 01:39:07.255

01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:10.005
Owen, you're really great.

01:39:11.921 --> 01:39:14.505
And I really like you.

01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:18.130
It's just this isn't the right thing
for me right now.

01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:20.255

01:39:26.463 --> 01:39:28.921
I'm really sorry if what I said
the other night

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:31.755
about your cake thing was, uh...

01:39:31.755 --> 01:39:34.380
I guess I'm not as comfortable
putting myself out there.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.880
Okay, did you just call me outgoing?

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.088
Yeah.

01:39:38.088 --> 01:39:39.796
'Cause that is the first time
in human history

01:39:39.796 --> 01:39:42.630
that anyone has ever referred to me
as outgoing.

01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:43.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:39:43.755 --> 01:39:45.338

01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:29.630
Oh.

01:43:29.796 --> 01:43:32.921
You know, I thought of another secret.

01:43:37.755 --> 01:43:40.338
I never wanted to move to L.A.

01:43:42.838 --> 01:43:47.255

wherever you went.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:53.921

darkest, coldest town...

01:43:56.088 --> 01:43:58.171
