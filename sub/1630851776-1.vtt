01:07.040 --> 01:11.145
Good evening, I'm Rachel
Bennett with 27 news.

01:11.178 --> 01:13.981
Breaking news, a
local detective's son

01:14.014 --> 01:18.919
has just released video
footage of a suicide online,

01:18.952 --> 01:22.757
but if you think you
will watch this footage,

01:22.790 --> 01:26.627
let me leave you
with one question.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.996
Do you believe in
the paranormal?

01:55.889 --> 01:57.625
911, what is your emergency?

01:57.657 --> 01:59.393
My husband.

02:00.627 --> 02:02.630
Oh my god, there's
blood everywhere,

02:02.663 --> 02:04.865
and he's not moving,

02:04.898 --> 02:05.909
and I don't know what to do!

02:05.933 --> 02:09.135
All units respond.

02:09.169 --> 02:12.907
Car 15 responding.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.474
EMT is en route.

02:28.021 --> 02:29.723
Officers are on the scene.

04:28.207 --> 04:29.743
What's up, guys?

04:29.775 --> 04:31.077
Just getting things ready.

04:34.181 --> 04:36.250
Do I have a surprise for you.

04:36.282 --> 04:40.219
So, my dad is a detective
that looks into old cases.

04:40.253 --> 04:42.022
I snooped through
some of the boxes

04:42.054 --> 04:43.723
he brought home the other day,

04:43.757 --> 04:47.127
and found video footage from
a local crime years ago.

04:47.159 --> 04:49.029
I cut and edited
the footage a bit

04:49.061 --> 04:51.130
to put it in a watchable format

04:51.164 --> 04:54.168
with some of my
finishing touches,

04:54.200 --> 04:58.705
but take a look, and
tell me what you think.

04:58.738 --> 05:01.775
Suicide or not?

05:01.808 --> 05:03.344
Feel free to leave
comments on my page,

05:03.376 --> 05:05.045
and hit that like button.

05:12.919 --> 05:16.356
Okay, here we go.

05:44.084 --> 05:46.353
James,
what are you doing down there?

05:46.385 --> 05:48.289
I'm trying to
figure the camera out.

05:54.027 --> 05:55.229
Are you seriously going to try

05:55.262 --> 05:57.698
and record this weird shit?

06:00.801 --> 06:02.202
It just keeps getting worse-

06:02.234 --> 06:04.671
- don't worry, nat, you're
going away on business, anyway.

06:04.705 --> 06:06.207
This has to get documented.

06:12.479 --> 06:14.181
I hit the button.

06:15.815 --> 06:17.193
All right, I think I have
figured this out enough

06:17.217 --> 06:19.385
to get started here, so.

06:19.419 --> 06:21.188
Little backstory first.

06:21.221 --> 06:24.091
A few weeks ago, I went
on a haunted ghosts tour

06:24.123 --> 06:25.892
in an old, abandoned prison,

06:25.926 --> 06:27.728
not too far down
the road from here.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.097
It was a pretty cool experience,

06:30.130 --> 06:32.399
but, ever since I got home,

06:32.431 --> 06:34.267
some really strange
things have been happening

06:34.301 --> 06:35.736
around my house.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.373
This is my wife Natalie.

06:40.474 --> 06:41.976
Get that out of my face.

06:43.042 --> 06:46.112
Yeah, she doesn't like to
be seen on camera that much.

06:48.248 --> 06:49.248
I did it again.

06:50.383 --> 06:52.419
Like I was saying, but
she's actually getting

06:52.452 --> 06:55.189
ready to leave on a business
trip for a few days,

06:55.222 --> 06:57.724
and I figured,
while she was away,

06:57.758 --> 06:59.426
I would use the time to document

06:59.459 --> 07:01.462
some of the things
going on, and put it

07:01.495 --> 07:03.163
up online for you
guys to all view

07:03.195 --> 07:05.398
and tell me what you
guys think is going on.

07:06.366 --> 07:07.767
You know, anyway-

07:07.801 --> 07:08.368
- I'm almost
ready to leave soon.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
Okay, nat.

07:10.803 --> 07:13.039
You know, we got back form
the haunted ghost tour

07:13.073 --> 07:15.743
and all kinds of strange
things were going on.

07:16.476 --> 07:17.911
You know, we'd hear noises,

07:17.943 --> 07:19.847
things were getting
moved out of place,

07:19.880 --> 07:22.282
and I swear on my
life, I even see

07:22.315 --> 07:24.284
this shadow figure
in my bedroom.

07:24.316 --> 07:27.821
I mean, this stuff is really
starting to freak us out.

07:29.289 --> 07:30.890
James, I'm leaving now.

07:30.924 --> 07:31.924
Okay.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.300
All right, have a safe trip.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.133
I love you.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.102
I love you, I'll call you.

07:43.135 --> 07:44.137
All right.

07:57.150 --> 07:58.150
All right.

07:59.251 --> 08:01.254
Ah, we're a little blurry here.

08:01.287 --> 08:02.489
Let it correct itself.

08:05.892 --> 08:08.262
Anyway, the fun's
about to begin.

08:09.496 --> 08:11.298
What I'm gonna do is
record day and night

08:11.330 --> 08:13.366
in different rooms of the house.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.269
We're gonna try to
record what we can.

08:15.301 --> 08:17.003
Depending on what
we get on camera,

08:17.037 --> 08:18.347
we're gonna upload
it to the Internet

08:18.371 --> 08:20.207
for you guys to all watch,

08:20.239 --> 08:22.575
and I want yous to be
the deciding factoring.

08:22.609 --> 08:24.945
Am I nuts or is there something

08:24.977 --> 08:27.046
really going on inside my house?

08:28.414 --> 08:29.415
Let the fun begin.

08:33.285 --> 08:34.285
All right.

08:35.288 --> 08:36.188
So now let's do a
little walkthrough.

08:36.222 --> 08:39.226
I'm gonna kind of just
describe and show you

08:39.259 --> 08:43.462
the rooms where the
most things happen.

08:43.496 --> 08:45.031
Let's get started here.

08:53.039 --> 08:55.509
We'll start in the kitchen here.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.411
Kind of a lot happens
in the kitchen.

09:00.614 --> 09:02.282
You know, in the
kitchen we'll have

09:02.314 --> 09:04.150
things getting moved around.

09:04.183 --> 09:08.856
You hear dishes moving,
cabinets opening and closing.

09:08.889 --> 09:10.591
This has happened
in the day already,

09:10.624 --> 09:12.393
but it mainly happens at night.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.303
But, I mean, the weirdest
thing is when things get moved.

09:15.327 --> 09:17.130
Like right here is a cup, right?

09:17.997 --> 09:19.432
This cup will be here.

09:19.466 --> 09:20.601
I'll put it there.

09:20.634 --> 09:23.137
And like an hour later,
I'll come back in,

09:24.337 --> 09:25.972
and this thing will
be moved over here.

09:26.005 --> 09:29.208
So it'll go from here
to here all on its own.

09:29.241 --> 09:31.044
You know, unless
I'm going crazy,

09:31.077 --> 09:33.880
which I really don't
think I'm going crazy,

09:33.914 --> 09:36.884
but something weird's going on.

09:36.917 --> 09:38.952
This is what we're
trying to find out.

09:38.985 --> 09:40.421
Hopefully, we
catch it on camera.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.655
So we'll keep going.

09:42.688 --> 09:44.058
We'll go into the
living room here.

09:45.025 --> 09:47.093
The living room, as you can see,

09:47.126 --> 09:50.363
it's sort of decorated for
Halloween in here a little bit.

09:51.331 --> 09:52.366
Some stuff there.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.333
Little bit there.

09:56.303 --> 09:58.404
Anyway, the living room,
we haven't caught too much.

09:58.438 --> 10:01.909
We mainly hear it more
coming from other rooms,

10:01.942 --> 10:04.411
either the kitchen or upstairs
while we're down here.

10:04.443 --> 10:08.347
But you might hear like
a door opening, shutting,

10:08.380 --> 10:11.451
and, you know,
squeaking a little bit,

10:11.483 --> 10:14.387
but it's mainly coming from
other rooms outside here.

10:15.288 --> 10:17.491
So I'm gonna walk
upstairs to the bedroom.

10:20.427 --> 10:21.629
It's where the most happens.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.369
So while we're inside
the bedroom here.

10:31.972 --> 10:34.241
Here's the bed that we sleep in.

10:34.274 --> 10:37.510
While I'm sleeping in the
bed, we'll hear the noises.

10:37.544 --> 10:39.413
I swear that, one
night, the covers

10:39.446 --> 10:41.581
started pulling off as me
as I was trying to sleep.

10:41.614 --> 10:43.292
So, hopefully, we'll
get something like that

10:43.316 --> 10:46.553
on camera one of these
nights, but, you know,

10:46.586 --> 10:49.423
nat thinks I'm crazy,
and I know I'm not crazy,

10:49.456 --> 10:51.725
and I know I saw what I saw.

10:51.757 --> 10:54.026
Right on that wall over
there next to the window

10:54.059 --> 10:55.996
is where the black
shadow figure was,

10:56.763 --> 10:58.532
and it just kinda creeped,

10:59.332 --> 11:01.201
almost as if it came
out of the ground,

11:01.233 --> 11:05.004
just kinda creeped up,
and it just slowly walked

11:05.038 --> 11:10.044
its way and just vanished
right through the wall.

11:10.943 --> 11:12.712
I even ran to the
other side of the room.

11:12.746 --> 11:15.615
When I got to the other side,
there was nothing there.

11:15.648 --> 11:17.284
I mean, this is
some strange stuff,

11:17.317 --> 11:19.586
some really freaky stuff
starting to happen here.

11:21.286 --> 11:22.564
You know, I don't
know what else to do

11:22.588 --> 11:25.592
other than try to document
it and let others decide

11:25.625 --> 11:26.625
what's going on.

11:28.093 --> 11:29.462
We're gonna walk
back downstairs.

11:36.468 --> 11:37.468
Okay.

11:39.472 --> 11:40.472
We're looking good.

11:41.808 --> 11:43.476
All right, we look all set up.

11:44.778 --> 11:46.212
All right, I'm setting up

11:46.246 --> 11:47.423
on the kitchen for
the first night.

11:47.447 --> 11:50.049
Hopefully, we catch
something moving

11:50.082 --> 11:52.419
or find out what one
of those sounds are

11:52.452 --> 11:54.154
that we hear while
we're trying to sleep,

11:54.187 --> 11:56.190
so let's hope for the best.

12:02.127 --> 12:03.597
I'm leaving this
cup set up here.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.533
Hopefully, we catch it
moving during the night.

12:08.101 --> 12:09.669
I'll see you in the morning.

15:07.646 --> 15:08.648
Oh, my gosh.

15:12.284 --> 15:13.286
Oh, morning.

15:15.388 --> 15:16.756
I didn't sleep too well,

15:16.789 --> 15:20.659
but I didn't hear anything,
either, last night,

15:20.693 --> 15:24.396
so you never know.

15:24.429 --> 15:25.665
Doesn't happen every night.

15:52.692 --> 15:55.395
Oh, and I found our cat pixie.

15:57.563 --> 15:58.530
You know what, she
doesn't ever seem

15:58.563 --> 16:02.401
to get too scared or
freaked out by anything, so.

16:05.038 --> 16:06.038
But you never know.

16:10.009 --> 16:12.746
I have to work today,
so I'm gonna eat

16:12.779 --> 16:15.515
and get ready and go to work.

16:16.515 --> 16:17.851
We'll film again later tonight.

16:26.425 --> 16:27.425
All right.

16:39.038 --> 16:40.874
All right, looks good.

16:40.906 --> 16:42.408
What's up, guys?

16:42.442 --> 16:43.610
We're on the kitchen again.

16:43.643 --> 16:44.752
I'm gonna cover the
kitchen one more night,

16:44.776 --> 16:46.845
just to try to cover, you know,

16:46.879 --> 16:48.057
all the sounds and
stuff that I hear.

16:48.081 --> 16:49.883
I wanna try to get
something on camera here.

16:49.915 --> 16:53.786
It's a good spot, but
I am gonna put the cup

16:53.819 --> 16:55.421
back on the counter, too, to see

16:55.454 --> 16:57.757
if we can get that moving
or not during the night.

16:58.857 --> 17:00.626
Let's hope for something.

19:22.668 --> 19:24.571
What the hell was that?

19:46.258 --> 19:50.896
Okay, so I just
woke up to a noise.

19:50.929 --> 19:53.967
I know I heard a noise,
it was like a door

19:53.999 --> 19:57.936
or a cabinet or something
shutting, like slamming almost.

19:57.969 --> 19:59.104
It was kinda loud.

19:59.905 --> 20:02.008
It was more loud than
anything ever so far.

20:05.044 --> 20:06.044
I'm gonna look around.

20:59.031 --> 21:01.568
Well, I couldn't find anything.

21:02.601 --> 21:03.601
I didn't see anything.

21:04.536 --> 21:06.315
I guess when we watch
the camera footage back,

21:06.339 --> 21:08.841
we'll eventually
see what it was,

21:08.873 --> 21:10.108
if we caught anything or not,

21:10.141 --> 21:14.948
but I'm gonna let you
keep setting up here.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.248
I'm gonna get back to bed.

22:16.141 --> 22:17.141
Oh.

22:19.411 --> 22:20.411
I'm still so tired.

22:25.184 --> 22:28.955
I told yous, I don't
know what that noise was,

22:28.987 --> 22:31.725
but it was something.

22:37.796 --> 22:40.733
I'm gonna get some
breakfast quick.

23:50.335 --> 23:52.204
I do have some running
around to do today,

23:52.237 --> 23:57.243
so, what I'm thinking is,
I'll leave the camera set up,

23:58.476 --> 24:00.780
filming during the
day a little bit,

24:00.813 --> 24:04.016
just to see if we can catch
anything during the day.

27:28.019 --> 27:30.655
All right, so I'm gonna
have you set up here

27:30.688 --> 27:35.093
on the family room here while
I'm watching some TV tonight.

27:35.127 --> 27:36.229
We'll see what we get.

32:21.746 --> 32:24.283
I swear, I hear something
from the upstairs,

32:25.484 --> 32:26.718
but I don't know what it is.

32:28.553 --> 32:29.822
Let's go check it out.

34:23.834 --> 34:24.834
Nothing.

34:41.485 --> 34:46.491
So, I went up and looked around,
and I didn't see anything.

34:48.860 --> 34:51.764
But I heard stuff, some noises,

34:51.796 --> 34:56.635
but I don't know.

34:58.970 --> 35:01.039
I'm gonna leave this
set up down here

35:01.072 --> 35:02.541
for the rest of the night.

35:04.008 --> 35:06.677
I'm not gonna sleep
up there after that.

35:06.711 --> 35:09.014
I'll sleep right on the couch.

40:06.276 --> 40:09.213
All right, so, I'm gonna
eat some breakfast,

40:09.247 --> 40:10.490
and then I gotta
head out for the day,

40:10.514 --> 40:14.185
so we'll set back up later
today then, all right?

40:20.758 --> 40:22.193
All right.

40:22.227 --> 40:23.929
So, change of plans.

40:24.963 --> 40:27.040
I think I'm gonna leave you
set up on the family room here

40:27.064 --> 40:29.066
while I run out
and do my errands,

40:29.099 --> 40:32.336
so, hopefully, we get something.

43:03.287 --> 43:07.892
All right, guys, I'm gonna set
up in my bedroom for tonight.

43:08.526 --> 43:09.595
See what we get.

47:17.742 --> 47:19.811
Well, I don't know
if we caught anything

47:19.843 --> 47:21.243
on the camera last
night or not, but.

47:25.916 --> 47:26.916
I didn't hear anything.

47:33.624 --> 47:35.627
I'm gonna start getting
ready for the day,

47:35.660 --> 47:38.897
and catch up with yous later.

47:46.570 --> 47:48.572
All right, guys, i'm
gonna do something

47:48.606 --> 47:49.674
a little different today.

47:51.275 --> 47:53.711
I'm gonna walk around the
house and ask some questions.

47:54.778 --> 47:58.349
If something's really here,
maybe we'll get a response.

48:13.664 --> 48:17.702
If there's a spirit in this
house, can you give us a sign?

48:34.485 --> 48:35.854
Why are you here?

48:39.823 --> 48:40.959
What is your purpose?

49:16.693 --> 49:19.363
I don't know, guys, nothing yet.

49:28.673 --> 49:30.308
Oh, shit, what was that?

49:34.678 --> 49:35.880
Is something with us?

49:39.950 --> 49:41.653
If something is in this room,

49:42.586 --> 49:44.789
can you please give us.

49:44.822 --> 49:45.822
What?

49:48.459 --> 49:49.661
What the fuck?

49:52.329 --> 49:57.334
Okay, that picture frame
fell, and I don't know why.

49:59.803 --> 50:01.673
This is getting a little weird.

50:04.474 --> 50:09.346
Why are you here,
and what do you want?

50:31.468 --> 50:32.745
Yeah, I'm a little
freaked out by that,

50:32.769 --> 50:37.708
so I think I'm done for now.

50:39.376 --> 50:41.746
Eerie tones continue.

50:41.778 --> 50:44.581
All right, guys, we're
gonna try the bedroom

50:44.615 --> 50:48.352
again here tonight to
see if we get something.

50:48.385 --> 50:50.088
I don't think we got
anything last night,

50:50.121 --> 50:53.325
so give it another shot.

55:41.744 --> 55:43.747
I actually slept
pretty good last night.

55:48.218 --> 55:49.218
I didn't wake up.

55:52.055 --> 55:54.124
I haven't slept that
good in a long time.

56:15.345 --> 56:18.182
Saw or heard
anything last night,

56:18.215 --> 56:19.751
but this shit is fucking crazy.

56:31.195 --> 56:32.229
What the fuck is this?

56:34.030 --> 56:34.931
I don't know if
someone's playing

56:34.965 --> 56:36.967
a fucking game on me right now

56:36.999 --> 56:38.202
or what the fuck's going on,

56:39.470 --> 56:43.140
but what I do know
is I don't even know

56:43.173 --> 56:45.075
if I can be in this
fucking house anymore.

56:58.956 --> 57:03.160
You know, I don't even
know what's going on.

57:08.164 --> 57:11.802
I mean, is this
really happening?

57:25.182 --> 57:29.253
You know, I never believed
in this kind of stuff,

57:31.188 --> 57:35.193
but it's really starting
to freak me out.

57:41.365 --> 57:43.234
I mean, I'm parked

57:43.267 --> 57:44.869
in just some random parking lot.

57:49.939 --> 57:51.374
I don't even know what to do.

57:57.914 --> 58:02.853
I think I need to just go
home and get a few things,

58:03.954 --> 58:06.390
and stay in a hotel
for the night.

58:21.171 --> 58:22.206
What's up, guys?

58:23.340 --> 58:25.108
I can't take this shit anymore.

58:26.110 --> 58:28.354
I don't know, I'm just gonna
come here and get a few things,

58:28.378 --> 58:31.048
and I'm gonna leave
'cause, honestly,

58:31.081 --> 58:33.383
I don't even wanna be
here anymore by myself.

58:34.584 --> 58:36.253
What the fuck is going on?

58:39.889 --> 58:41.324
Why don't you just
leave me alone!

58:44.427 --> 58:46.262
What the hell?

58:46.296 --> 58:47.464
Let me out of this house!

58:51.300 --> 58:52.569
Leave me alone!

59:12.222 --> 59:14.358
I don't know what's
going on right now.

59:17.394 --> 59:19.396
I've never been so
scared in my life.

59:24.468 --> 59:26.170
Just leave me the fuck alone.

59:35.012 --> 59:37.147
God, please help me.

1:00:09.546 --> 1:00:11.883
I must've fell
asleep in the closet.

1:00:38.642 --> 1:00:42.346
That was the scariest
thing in my life.

1:00:42.378 --> 1:00:43.980
And it's getting out of hand.

1:00:49.186 --> 1:00:51.220
What the fuck?

1:01:01.430 --> 1:01:04.501
Look, this is getting
really out of hand.

1:01:07.403 --> 1:01:11.508
Like, this is my home, and
I'm scared to even be here.

1:01:14.343 --> 1:01:16.380
I need to find
someone to help me.

1:01:57.421 --> 1:02:01.692
So I found this guy that
does spiritual cleansing.

1:02:02.793 --> 1:02:04.695
I don't know, he
says he can help, so.

1:02:07.164 --> 1:02:08.399
He should be here soon.

1:02:25.648 --> 1:02:26.516
Hi, I'm James.

1:02:26.550 --> 1:02:28.452
- Chris.
- Come on in.

1:02:28.485 --> 1:02:29.485
Yeah.

1:02:30.653 --> 1:02:31.653
Oh, yeah.

1:02:32.655 --> 1:02:34.457
Yeah, you feel that
right away, don't ya?

1:02:34.490 --> 1:02:35.492
- Yeah.
- As soon as you

1:02:35.525 --> 1:02:36.427
walk in the place.

1:02:36.459 --> 1:02:38.461
Just take a seat here.

1:02:41.697 --> 1:02:46.169
So, you know, I've been
filming for a few days now.

1:02:47.570 --> 1:02:49.448
Mainly because I wanna
prove that I'm not insane,

1:02:49.472 --> 1:02:53.509
but, also, there's something
really going on here.

1:02:53.543 --> 1:02:54.543
Yeah.

1:02:55.378 --> 1:02:56.488
You know, why don't you begin,

1:02:56.512 --> 1:03:00.083
just tell me when and how
this whole thing got started.

1:03:01.550 --> 1:03:05.621
So, a few weeks ago, we
went on this haunted tour,

1:03:05.655 --> 1:03:06.655
kind of local.

1:03:07.557 --> 1:03:11.495
Ever since, things have been
really strange around here.

1:03:12.561 --> 1:03:16.599
Kind of started small, but
the more we mess with it,

1:03:17.767 --> 1:03:18.836
the stronger it gets.

1:03:20.202 --> 1:03:21.704
Anything strange
happen on the tour?

1:03:24.673 --> 1:03:26.177
Not that I can think of.

1:03:27.144 --> 1:03:28.178
Any strange noises?

1:03:29.479 --> 1:03:30.714
Unusual feelings?

1:03:33.550 --> 1:03:37.621
Well, it was an old prison, so.

1:03:37.653 --> 1:03:42.392
But there was this one cell.

1:03:45.595 --> 1:03:47.164
We walked by and it just felt

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:54.171
almost like all the hair
on my body stood up.

1:03:56.405 --> 1:03:57.405
Yeah.

1:03:58.474 --> 1:04:01.377
Yeah.

1:04:01.410 --> 1:04:03.313
Listen, after talking
with you on the phone and

1:04:03.345 --> 1:04:04.689
hearing your story
how this started

1:04:04.713 --> 1:04:08.518
I think I'm starting to
know what's going on.

1:04:08.552 --> 1:04:10.754
A spirit's attached
itself to you.

1:04:10.787 --> 1:04:13.624
It's likely it
happened on the tour.

1:04:13.657 --> 1:04:14.834
All right, now,
when this happens,

1:04:14.858 --> 1:04:19.130
it'll continue to follow
you, take your energy.

1:04:20.430 --> 1:04:21.765
Feed off your emotions,

1:04:21.798 --> 1:04:23.734
until you find a way
to get rid of it.

1:04:25.834 --> 1:04:29.706
So how do we do that?

1:04:29.738 --> 1:04:31.909
Oh, I know how to do it.

1:04:31.941 --> 1:04:37.148
Thing is, spirits get
strength from fear.

1:04:39.515 --> 1:04:41.651
The more attention you give
it, the stronger it gets.

1:04:44.688 --> 1:04:47.791
Well, I just need to
get rid of this thing.

1:04:49.226 --> 1:04:50.327
It's not safe anymore.

1:04:51.628 --> 1:04:53.631
I want it gone before
my wife gets home.

1:04:55.764 --> 1:04:56.764
Okay.

1:04:58.668 --> 1:05:00.704
Okay, James, let's prepare.

1:05:23.927 --> 1:05:25.329
It's probably best if we start

1:05:25.361 --> 1:05:27.831
down here, work
our way upstairs.

1:06:12.075 --> 1:06:13.075
All right.

1:06:15.577 --> 1:06:17.814
All right, let's get started.

1:06:24.486 --> 1:06:26.423
This is a house of god.

1:06:28.090 --> 1:06:30.393
In the name of god,
the father almighty,

1:06:31.727 --> 1:06:35.898
you'll leave this house,
leave this family alone.

1:06:38.668 --> 1:06:40.271
Hey, you feel that?

1:06:41.570 --> 1:06:43.873
The energy is getting stronger.

1:06:43.907 --> 1:06:45.809
It definitely doesn't
want me in here.

1:06:52.115 --> 1:06:53.984
In the name of Jesus Christ,

1:06:54.918 --> 1:06:57.588
our lord and savior,
you'll leave this house,

1:06:58.954 --> 1:07:00.356
leave this family alone.

1:07:08.097 --> 1:07:09.900
In the name of the holy spirit.

1:07:17.106 --> 1:07:18.842
In the name of the holy spirit.

1:07:24.012 --> 1:07:25.715
You will leave this house.

1:07:26.883 --> 1:07:27.883
Now!

1:07:29.818 --> 1:07:31.454
In the name of Jesus Christ.

1:07:37.093 --> 1:07:38.093
What the fuck?

1:07:44.901 --> 1:07:46.536
Is this real?

1:07:46.568 --> 1:07:48.371
What's going on?

1:07:48.405 --> 1:07:49.773
You will leave this house now.

1:07:52.575 --> 1:07:53.910
Jesus Christ.

1:07:53.943 --> 1:07:54.845
What the fuck?

1:07:54.878 --> 1:07:56.012
Are you okay?

1:08:15.965 --> 1:08:17.000
I need to finish.

1:08:29.912 --> 1:08:32.515
This house is a house of god.

1:08:38.153 --> 1:08:39.889
This man is a child of god.

1:08:42.959 --> 1:08:46.863
You are not welcome here.

1:08:50.066 --> 1:08:54.505
In the name of the father,
in the name of the son,

1:08:57.005 --> 1:08:58.474
and of the holy ghost,

1:08:59.942 --> 1:09:04.513
you will leave this house and
go back from whence you came.

1:10:02.037 --> 1:10:03.039
I think we're good.

1:10:07.977 --> 1:10:09.179
I don't feel it anymore.

1:10:17.687 --> 1:10:19.823
That's the strongest spirit
I've found in a long time.

1:10:25.995 --> 1:10:27.598
I think we're all right.

1:10:29.965 --> 1:10:32.736
I think we're
gonna be all right.

1:10:37.072 --> 1:10:39.876
Hey, guys, sorry, the
battery died earlier.

1:10:41.110 --> 1:10:44.548
So, this guy came, he
did what he had to do.

1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:46.048
Honestly, I think it worked.

1:10:46.081 --> 1:10:47.249
Nothing's happened since.

1:10:47.282 --> 1:10:48.884
I don't feel anything around me.

1:10:48.918 --> 1:10:50.786
I honestly feel like my mind,

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:54.023
my body, I feel so much
more at ease right now,

1:10:54.057 --> 1:10:55.125
so that's a good thing,

1:10:55.157 --> 1:10:57.259
but I don't wanna take chances.

1:10:57.293 --> 1:11:00.196
So, we're gonna set up one last
time tonight in the bedroom.

1:11:00.228 --> 1:11:02.331
I wanna make sure we don't
catch anything on camera.

1:11:02.365 --> 1:11:04.968
I wanna make sure this
thing is gone for good.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:06.611
The shit was getting
scary for a little bit,

1:11:06.635 --> 1:11:09.540
so, all right, I'll
see yous later tonight.

1:11:13.076 --> 1:11:17.180
All right, just
about set up here.

1:11:18.214 --> 1:11:21.151
All right, so let's give
this one last night here.

1:11:22.785 --> 1:11:24.187
Hope that everything's gone.

1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.255
What the hell was that?

1:15:59.961 --> 1:16:01.296
I'm getting the fuck out.
