00:45.938 --> 00:50.109
Wait here.
I don't know how long I'll be.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.600
Yes, sir.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.600
Heil Hitler.

01:25.561 --> 01:27.479
He won't last five minutes.

01:27.646 --> 01:30.566
How do you know?

01:35.988 --> 01:38.949
Because the others didn't.

01:39.116 --> 01:45.664
Doctor Hess, General Mueller is waiting impatiently
for the results of your Deathcore project.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.419
I know! I know!

01:50.586 --> 01:55.633
We are generous enough to give you a lab
with the best of equipment...

01:55.799 --> 01:59.678
... and the freedom to proceed as you wish.

01:59.970 --> 02:03.682
We expect something in return.
This just won't do.

02:05.184 --> 02:13.233
Well, then perhaps General Mueller
should have given this project to Mengele
or one of the other butchers instead of me.

02:27.081 --> 02:32.169
The loss of our troops on the
Russian front is crippling us.

02:36.465 --> 02:39.426
You said you could devise a drug that would give
this dead soldier movement...

02:39.593 --> 02:44.139
... so he could be used as a
shield for the living troops, yes?

02:44.807 --> 02:50.270
If you lied about your abilities,
then you are a traitor, doctor.

02:51.063 --> 02:53.983
I didn't lie!

02:54.191 --> 02:58.988
- But I need more time!
- I don't have the authority to extend time...

03:00.447 --> 03:04.910
... but I must report your failure.

05:23.298 --> 05:26.260
This world ain't big enough
for the both of us, partner.

05:26.426 --> 05:30.889
I will conquer the world, and
there's nothing you can do to stop me.

05:32.683 --> 05:36.728
I wouldn't say that, you sidewinder.

06:19.605 --> 06:23.609
I never know what they're going
to do or say.

06:23.775 --> 06:26.737
Let me hide in your pocket.

06:26.904 --> 06:28.822
You have been stealing.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.908
Father, I didn't steal a...

06:31.074 --> 06:32.993
Peppermints, peppermints everywhere, look.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.078
It's a good job you put plenty of candy
into Peter's pocket...

06:35.245 --> 06:39.249
... or we might have been very angry with you.
Mightn't we, Peter?

06:39.416 --> 06:42.211
I will forgive him.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.548
All right, children. Now the puppets are
very tired. They must go to bed now.

06:46.715 --> 06:49.676
Sleep? Puppets need to sleep?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.804
Puppets need sleep just as much
as you do.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.600
Goodbye.

06:52.971 --> 06:54.890
Please come back and see us again soon.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.975
Ok, Mr. Toulon.

06:57.142 --> 07:01.104
Come, Peter. Come, children.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
Come, Peter.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.171
You have a devoted audience, Mr. Toulon.

07:26.338 --> 07:28.257
I know I'm devoted to them.

07:28.423 --> 07:32.261
They love your puppets.

07:32.594 --> 07:36.598
The children enjoy the show, and I'm
rewarded by their laughter,
which is honest.

07:36.765 --> 07:39.726
If not always prudent.

07:39.893 --> 07:44.940
I wonder if they laughed so hard
if they truly understood
what they were watching.

07:45.107 --> 07:49.987
Oh, I'm sure they would.
Political satire is one of the
marks of a healthy society.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.282
I didn't get your name.

07:53.448 --> 07:55.367
Lieutenant Erich Stein.

07:55.534 --> 07:57.452
Fellow puppeteer.

07:57.619 --> 08:03.750
I've been carving marionettes since
I was ten years old, and I must say
your craftsmanship is superb.

08:04.918 --> 08:05.794
You are very kind, Lieutenant.

08:05.961 --> 08:10.590
How do you manipulate them
without string-works?

08:12.217 --> 08:14.136
Motorization. It is my own method.

08:14.303 --> 08:17.139
Fascinating.

08:17.431 --> 08:20.392
Almost like magic.

08:20.559 --> 08:24.563
One day, I'd like to see you work.

08:24.730 --> 08:28.734
I'm sure that could be arranged.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.863
You are an artist, Mr. Toulon.

08:33.071 --> 08:37.075
I just hope that you'll be allowed to
continue practicing your art.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.100
Eight shows a week is
enough practice for me.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
Quite.

08:41.413 --> 08:47.377
For your own sake, you might consider
changing the subject matter of your shows.

08:48.712 --> 08:54.634
It is just a puppet show.
The children like it as it is.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.600
Well...

08:56.011 --> 09:00.015
Thank you very much.
Goodnight, Mrs. Toulon...

09:00.182 --> 09:02.100
... and goodnight to you.

09:02.267 --> 09:05.395
Fellow puppeteer.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
Good night.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.600
My god.

09:25.207 --> 09:28.168
Just a young man, I assure you.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.253
He wanted to frighten me.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.382
He didn't. I think he was impressed with my work.

09:33.548 --> 09:38.595
For all the wrong reasons.
Lieutenant Stein could be a real
problem, my darling.

09:38.762 --> 09:43.183
Not if we don't show fear.

09:52.317 --> 09:56.780
Come on my friends.
Time for dinner.

10:03.787 --> 10:08.333
You gave quite a performance tonight.

10:19.428 --> 10:23.765
How come you always manage to be
first in line for dinner, eh?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
You have such a big appetite.

10:30.897 --> 10:35.735
You could easily be the first in line
if you wanted to, because you are
bigger than anybody else.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.600
But you're not a bully-boy, are you?

10:51.751 --> 10:55.714
And you, always laughing about everything,
always joking as a friend of mine would say.

11:02.179 --> 11:05.600
And for you, well, life is just
one big battle for you, isn't it?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and
you are happy as a sandboy.

12:03.698 --> 12:08.245
You know, Elsa, for years I have been
trying to paint you a portrait.

12:08.912 --> 12:09.788
Oh, Andre, you didn't.

12:09.955 --> 12:15.001
No, no, no. Every time I tried, you
finished up looking like my mother.

12:15.168 --> 12:19.130
I'm hopeless with canvass and paint.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
Oh, Andre.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.100
It's beautiful.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.600
She is the image of you.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.600
Oh, darling.

12:32.894 --> 12:35.398
What have I done to deserve you?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
You didn't do anything.

12:38.108 --> 12:41.069
Experienced men are very sexy.

12:41.236 --> 12:46.283
Sometimes, I think my life began
when I met you...

12:46.449 --> 12:50.161
... and now I would die without you.

12:50.620 --> 12:54.124
I'm never going to leave you. Never.

13:05.218 --> 13:10.557
The show itself is a disgusting
burlesque of the Fuehrer and makes
a mockery of the Reich.

13:16.688 --> 13:21.109
Yes. Have the men ready to leave immediately.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.100
Sir, there is something else.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.600
Yes?

13:26.072 --> 13:29.576
Lieutenant, what is this?

13:31.286 --> 13:37.250
I may be wrong but it seems as though
these wooden figures are walking about
on their own.

13:37.542 --> 13:41.129
You're not mistaken, sir.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
Well...

13:52.140 --> 13:54.059
Explain this.

13:54.225 --> 13:56.144
I really can't, sir.

13:56.311 --> 14:01.358
Mr. Toulon has developed a method of animating
his puppets without string.

14:01.524 --> 14:04.486
He claimed they were motorized,
but it's much more than that.

14:04.653 --> 14:07.614
I've seen them walk.

14:07.781 --> 14:12.827
React to sound as if they could hear.

14:12.994 --> 14:15.100
It's as if they were alive.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.600
Stein...

14:23.421 --> 14:25.340
... have you lost your senses?

14:25.507 --> 14:28.468
It's the truth, sir.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.388
In the pictures.

14:31.763 --> 14:34.724
Well, Krauss, I must speak to Toulon
before the Gestapo does.

14:34.891 --> 14:36.810
Impossible.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.438
Have the car brought around.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.600
I never take things at face value...

14:43.233 --> 14:47.237
... but if Stein is even half-right,
this could be very important to my work.

14:47.404 --> 14:51.408
If Toulon has the information,
I will get it for you, doctor.

14:51.574 --> 14:54.536
Oh, yes, yes. And you'll end up killing him,
and we'll learn nothing.

14:54.703 --> 14:58.707
You have an obligation
to the Deathcore Project too.

14:58.873 --> 15:04.087
I have an obligation to expose
the dissident and to silence him!

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
If Toulon can be of use,
I'll take that under consideration.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.817
Get me General Mueller.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.902
It's doctor Hess.

15:28.069 --> 15:30.947
Yes, it's urgent.

15:47.881 --> 15:48.757
Mueller, yes?

15:48.923 --> 15:54.763
I'm sorry to bother you, General, but we have a matter
brewing that might delay the progress of
the Deathcore Project indefinitely.

15:57.265 --> 16:01.603
We need to talk to a puppeteer named
Andre Toulon who can assist us.

16:02.479 --> 16:08.568
No, I understand, you need to speak to Toulon
before Krauss clubbers him up in his torture chamber.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.653
Put him on.

16:10.820 --> 16:14.407
It's General Mueller for you.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.600
Yes?

16:23.333 --> 16:28.129
Major, I want you to cooperate
with doctor Hess completely,
and that's an order...

16:29.589 --> 16:31.508
... and I don't want
this kind of call again.

16:31.674 --> 16:35.600
I'm tired of separating you two
like fighting schoolboys.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.600
Yes, sir, General.

16:43.144 --> 16:46.600
My only request is that ...
... you let my men do the job.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.600
Do not interfere.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
We wouldn't want to see you injured, Hess.

17:08.169 --> 17:09.045
Just like the real thing, huh?

17:09.212 --> 17:12.799
Only more intelligent.

17:14.425 --> 17:17.387
This theatre is closed...

17:17.554 --> 17:21.974
... by the authority of the German High Command.

17:30.066 --> 17:34.070
Your career as an entertainer is over,
Mr. Toulon.

17:34.237 --> 17:38.449
This is one of the puppets
I was telling you about.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.600
Doctor?

17:53.100 --> 17:54.600
Mr. Toulon...

17:55.091 --> 18:00.597
... I would like to talk to you later
about your work.

18:04.475 --> 18:08.396
And here's... the miracle, yes?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.600
That's what I saw, yes.

18:10.732 --> 18:12.650
That shouldn't be difficult to analyze.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.778
All we need is the process.

18:15.945 --> 18:19.949
- Mr. Toulon, would you work with me when...
- No!

18:20.116 --> 18:22.035
Elsa, Elsa.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.163
Take what you want, you bastards,
and get out of here.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.205
That would be you, puppeteer.

18:26.372 --> 18:30.084
Oh my god, what have they done.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.504
Put him in the second car,
and take him to Gestapo headquarters.

18:33.671 --> 18:35.100
I'm not leaving my wife.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.600
Elsa, my darling.

18:36.799 --> 18:39.761
I'll call for an ambulance.
Get him out of here!

18:39.928 --> 18:42.889
You'll be all right, I promise you.
You'll be all right.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.100
Leave me alone, damn you
filthy murdering swine.

18:47.226 --> 18:50.355
And put the toys in with the toy-maker.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
Elsa!

19:17.465 --> 19:21.427
I believe it's time to
get back to work, doctor.

19:43.533 --> 19:47.537
My god, Krauss, that wasn't necessary.

19:47.704 --> 19:50.832
You got what you needed.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.928
And this will solve all your problems, doctor?

20:46.095 --> 20:50.099
If the pictures are correct,
I know it will be of use.

20:50.266 --> 20:55.313
But a great deal depends on Toulon
sharing his secret.

20:55.480 --> 21:02.320
I'm under orders as well, and...
the higher authority wants
a demonstration of your results... yesterday.

21:03.821 --> 21:09.410
I'll get with Toulon...
as soon as Major Krauss makes it possible.

21:56.999 --> 22:02.046
You should have waited to kill the woman.
We need this man's cooperation.

22:02.213 --> 22:05.675
It was stupid of you, Krauss.
Unworthy of you.

22:09.512 --> 22:14.517
General, I don't see the death of
the Jew woman as a problem.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.600
Yes?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.600
They're both sitting in front of me now.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.100
I see.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.600
Thank you.

22:29.323 --> 22:35.496
You ought to be congratulated, Krauss.
Mr. Toulon has escaped your custody.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.100
Hurry.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.600
All clear, Major.

23:19.373 --> 23:23.044
I want a thorough search
of the living quarters.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.100
- Nothing.
- Get out.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.600
Major, we have looked everywhere
and found nothing.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.600
All right.

24:40.705 --> 24:43.249
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir, Major.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.600
- Search every building within
a five-block radius.
- Yes, sir.

27:02.513 --> 27:05.975
Mr. Toulon, you... are a genius.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
"Pharmacy"

27:52.563 --> 27:56.567
Leeches. You suck our life's blood away.

28:00.905 --> 28:03.949
Elsa... Oh god.

28:05.075 --> 28:14.915
No thing must stop me from seeking you out and making
each one of you to your knees for what you have done.
And you will cry me "mercy," and I will have none.

28:26.972 --> 28:31.810
No mercy, my friends. No mercy.

31:27.361 --> 31:30.239
What are you doing?!

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
Guard! Guard!

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
Report to the morgue! Hurry!

32:29.923 --> 32:35.095
Elsa, this is the best I can do for you now.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.600
Elsa.

33:33.529 --> 33:37.616
But you can still revenge yourself.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.934
I'll be one hour. Take the car
to be serviced, then return here...

34:04.100 --> 34:07.600
... and, Erich, expect to be out all night.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.100
Yes, sir.

34:27.748 --> 34:32.170
Have the car ready.
Have yourself ready.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.759
Have your ass-hole ready.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
I don't believe it.

35:36.568 --> 35:40.530
Good night, fellow puppeteer.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.469
This is excellent, Major.

36:02.636 --> 36:04.554
This is nothing. There is no progress here.

36:04.721 --> 36:07.557
Open your eyes, will you?

36:07.849 --> 36:12.063
That is true he remained animate
for just a few minutes.

36:12.063 --> 36:15.148
There was no sign of violent rage this time.

36:15.148 --> 36:19.152
This subject could be controlled from the field.

36:19.319 --> 36:25.409
He was in a suicidal state, so he simply
related back to his before-death behaviour.

36:25.575 --> 36:29.579
Give me a soldier who is
killed by the enemy in battle...

36:29.746 --> 36:33.834
... and the results will be very different.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.171
Toulon's genius is at work.

36:39.131 --> 36:41.049
I need to speak to that man, Krauss.

36:41.216 --> 36:43.760
And so do I.

37:02.070 --> 37:03.989
You're not my driver.

37:04.156 --> 37:06.074
Where's Lieutenant Stein?

37:06.241 --> 37:09.161
Dead, sir.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.600
Oh my god.

37:13.540 --> 37:19.503
- You're saying that no one saw
him leaving, nothing at all?
- No, sir. I found him and contacted headquarters.

37:22.924 --> 37:26.053
Have the body removed
and send the report back to me.

37:36.736 --> 37:40.449
Sergeant!

37:41.600 --> 37:45.600
This is exactly what we found
at the marionette theatre.

38:05.675 --> 38:08.637
This is Toulon's,
isn't it, Major?

38:21.316 --> 38:25.570
I want every inch of this city searched.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.449
Find him.

38:29.658 --> 38:34.704
I don't care how many patrols it takes.

38:34.871 --> 38:37.624
Find him!

39:13.451 --> 39:17.455
Toulon, give yourself up.
We'll find you.

39:17.622 --> 39:21.585
It will be worse for you, believe me.
Give up.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.600
"Help the blind"

41:05.021 --> 41:07.983
I think we will be safe here.

41:08.149 --> 41:12.988
Tomorrow we start all over again.
Killing murderers in the middle of a war.

41:20.662 --> 41:23.623
This is not enough, doctor.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.751
We're almost there. If I can get to Toulon,
I know we can prolong the soldiers' new life...

41:26.918 --> 41:32.299
... but I must get to him.

41:33.174 --> 41:38.221
Reich's headquarters has informed us that
there's not enough time to wait for Toulon's recapture.

41:39.431 --> 41:44.019
General, we are very close to finding him.

41:44.644 --> 41:49.691
This toymaker, Major, managed to kill one of your men.
How is that possible?

41:49.858 --> 41:52.600
An investigation is underway.
203.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.000
Lieutenant Stein was very careless.

41:55.071 --> 41:59.034
That seems to be a problem of yours,
doesn't it Krauss?

42:01.328 --> 42:05.707
Now I don't want any more excuses.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.600
The humiliation to me...

42:06.600 --> 42:13.600
I'd rather have you two shot
than be disgraced in Marshall Goering's eyes once again.

42:15.925 --> 42:20.597
Now if you will excuse me,
I have a top-level meeting.

42:53.463 --> 42:58.301
Now, be careful.
Mueller will be well-armed.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.600
Of course, so are you.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.600
I wish I could handle Goering
as well as I can handle you.

45:15.271 --> 45:18.483
What is this joke?

45:56.600 --> 46:00.600
I am giving you fair warning...

46:01.600 --> 46:04.600
... your place is in the lab...

46:04.600 --> 46:07.600
... not with the Gestapo High Command.

46:08.600 --> 46:11.600
We need Andre Toulon, Major.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.600
Yeah?

46:21.600 --> 46:23.600
Just a moment.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
Yes, Krauss here.

46:33.600 --> 46:36.600
What happened?

46:36.600 --> 46:38.600
Oh my god.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.600
Yes, five minutes.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.600
What?

46:43.600 --> 46:45.600
Mueller's been killed.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.600
I'm coming with you.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.600
My friend, we will make
repairs on you very soon.

47:06.841 --> 47:08.760
Mr. Toulon?

47:08.926 --> 47:13.973
It's me, Peter Hertz.
Your puppet said I stole the candy, remember?

47:14.140 --> 47:16.059
How did you find me?

47:16.225 --> 47:21.481
By accident, Mr. Toulon.
Peter and I have been hiding in this cellar...

47:21.600 --> 47:23.600
... for two days.

47:24.567 --> 47:25.443
The Gestapo or the SS?

47:25.610 --> 47:27.528
Gestapo.

47:27.695 --> 47:32.742
I need a place to keep Peter
till I can get him to Switzerland.

47:32.909 --> 47:34.827
We didn't know you were here,
Mr. Toulon, I swear it.

47:34.994 --> 47:38.581
You won't give us away, will you?

47:39.165 --> 47:42.126
I would be a fool if I did.

47:42.293 --> 47:45.100
Now we're all fugitives together.

47:45.100 --> 47:46.600
Yes, fugitives.

47:55.848 --> 47:57.767
This is where it happened, yes?

47:57.934 --> 48:00.895
Look at the blood stains, Krauss.

48:01.062 --> 48:06.109
The General was hit standing in the middle
of the hallway, then he fell.

48:06.275 --> 48:10.613
And this... is the first bullet fired.

48:15.660 --> 48:18.621
If the assassin fired and missed...

48:18.788 --> 48:21.749
... why didn't Mueller shoot back, yeah?

48:21.916 --> 48:25.753
I'm sure he did.

48:26.087 --> 48:31.551
So why is there no body?

48:28.600 --> 48:31.600
Mueller could not have missed at such a close range.

48:32.343 --> 48:34.971
I don't know.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.600
Excuse me.

48:38.599 --> 48:42.854
I've never seen a bullet this small.

48:51.112 --> 48:54.031
What is it, Hess?

48:56.600 --> 48:59.600
My god...

49:00.496 --> 49:04.083
... I should have known.

49:05.710 --> 49:10.965
The Gestapo found out my wife
was originally from Warsaw.

49:11.966 --> 49:17.013
So they came to our house and arrested her,
claiming she was a spy.

49:17.180 --> 49:20.099
How did you escape?

49:20.308 --> 49:26.355
We didn't. I came home just as they were taking her away.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.600
I found Peter hiding in the kitchen cupboard.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.600
Ah, here comes supper.
Good boy.

49:35.948 --> 49:36.824
It's a picnic.

49:36.991 --> 49:40.703
You like this, don't you, boy?

49:41.162 --> 49:44.123
Yes, it's been a lot of fun, but...

49:44.290 --> 49:46.209
... I'll be glad to go home.

49:46.375 --> 49:49.600
Mother says she will be back soon,
and we'll all go to Switzerland together

49:49.600 --> 49:51.600
Yes, we all go... together.

49:54.717 --> 49:58.721
10 000 marks for the information leading to Toulon's capture.

49:58.888 --> 50:03.935
I want these posted all over the city within the hour.

50:05.144 --> 50:09.148
When you find Toulon, you're going
to execute him, aren't you, Krauss?

50:09.315 --> 50:13.319
Did you know that Toulon taught medicine in Paris?

50:13.486 --> 50:16.447
Quite a background researching in chemistry.

50:16.614 --> 50:20.576
I wonder why he gave it up?
Curious.

50:20.785 --> 50:21.661
Answer me!

50:21.828 --> 50:27.917
Yes, he will be executed immediately,
and it will be my good pleasure to fire the first bullet.

50:28.084 --> 50:30.002
I won't allow it.

50:30.169 --> 50:35.758
Andre Toulon is an enemy
of the Reich and of the New World Order.

50:36.425 --> 50:43.891
When the tin gods are destroyed,
the new world will be rebuilt by geniuses like Andre Toulon.

50:45.810 --> 50:50.022
Something you and I will never live to see, Krauss.

50:52.066 --> 50:57.113
I know you won't, doctor...
... but until I get that order...

50:57.280 --> 51:01.492
... you will continue the work. Guard!

51:04.579 --> 51:07.540
Until Toulon is captured, I think it best
you work under proper supervision.

51:07.707 --> 51:12.879
See that doctor Hess is escorted home.
Stay with him until you heard from me.

51:14.100 --> 51:16.100
Heil Hitler.

51:40.031 --> 51:42.992
You should be in bed.

51:43.159 --> 51:46.913
I like to stay up late.

51:51.500 --> 51:54.462
The way they move...
... it's magic, isn't it?

51:54.629 --> 51:58.299
Yes...
... and they can live forever.

51:59.842 --> 52:01.761
What happened to his arm?

52:01.928 --> 52:03.846
He got hurt doing me a favour...

52:04.013 --> 52:08.017
... and I can't get the parts
I need to make him a new arm.

52:08.184 --> 52:11.145
However, he has five more.

52:11.312 --> 52:17.401
I could get it.
Yes, I could go to your workshop,
with everything you need.

52:17.568 --> 52:18.444
I'd be your assistant.

52:18.611 --> 52:22.615
No, Peter, you stay here until your father
says it's safe for you to leave.

52:22.782 --> 52:25.329
You could be my assistant,
and you look after my other puppets for me.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.600
All right.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.600
You know...

52:29.600 --> 52:34.600
... that one looks a lot like the man that
came to see my mother the day she went away.

52:37.100 --> 52:38.600
Quiet!

53:14.917 --> 53:18.921
Sorry, Peter, now you go to bed and tomorrow
I'll put it on a special puppet show for you.

53:19.088 --> 53:22.925
With the six-shooter?
With the six-shooter. Goodnight.
Goodnight.

53:42.028 --> 53:43.946
Father, did you hear the soldier?

53:44.113 --> 53:48.451
Yes, I did, Peter.
I want you to stay inside, out of sight.

53:49.326 --> 53:52.288
Mr. Toulon kept me safe, and tomorrow
I get to be his assistant in his puppet show.

53:52.455 --> 53:56.459
I want you to stay away from Mr. Toulon.

53:56.625 --> 53:57.501
It's for your own good.

53:57.668 --> 54:00.713
Now go to sleep.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.600
"WANTED"

55:02.316 --> 55:07.905
You wouldn't volunteer for
a medical experiment, would you?

55:08.572 --> 55:12.618
No, no. I didn't think you would.

55:13.829 --> 55:18.040
Then... I must go out.

55:21.085 --> 55:24.004
Well, come on. Follow me.

55:24.213 --> 55:29.426
We don't want you getting
into trouble with Major Krauss.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.600
It's all right, private.
I'll let you know when I want to escape.

55:53.409 --> 55:57.121
Toulon must have kept a record.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.837
You could at least help me find it.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.600
Thank you.

56:29.904 --> 56:32.823
What do you think you're doing?

56:33.600 --> 56:35.600
What are you doing here?

56:38.288 --> 56:42.124
Are these things for yourself?

56:51.100 --> 56:52.600
You know...

56:52.843 --> 56:58.599
... if you really want to help Mr. Toulon, Peter,
you'll tell me where he is.

56:59.099 --> 57:03.562
All I want to do is talk to him...

57:01.600 --> 57:05.600
... and if I see anything that's not right,
I will leave right away.

57:06.398 --> 57:07.600
I am his assistant, you know.

57:07.600 --> 57:11.600
Yes, I know. You are a man of authority.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.600
But I don't want to harm Mr. Toulon...

57:14.600 --> 57:16.600
... because...

57:16.600 --> 57:18.600
... I don't want you mad at me.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.600
I can't tell you exactly.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.600
There.

57:55.406 --> 57:58.867
Wait here. That's an order.

58:28.772 --> 58:32.776
Mr. Toulon, I brought a friend.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.904
Don't be afraid.
I'm doctor Hess, Mr. Toulon.

58:36.071 --> 58:37.990
I remember you.

58:38.157 --> 58:43.912
- I didn't come here to have you arrested.
- He promised me he only wanted to talk.

58:44.413 --> 58:49.001
Peter, take these tools you bring
and clean them like a good assistant.

58:52.755 --> 58:55.716
Sit.

58:59.011 --> 59:04.058
Killing you would be no problem for me, doctor.

59:04.224 --> 59:06.143
I know, I just wanted to speak with you.

59:06.310 --> 59:12.358
Be careful what you say.
My friends are very sensitive.

59:13.609 --> 59:16.570
I thought we could talk
doctor to doctor.

59:16.737 --> 59:17.613
You have the wrong man.

59:17.780 --> 59:20.741
You taught medicine in Paris.

59:20.908 --> 59:23.869
Chemistry and anatomy were specialties.

59:24.036 --> 59:26.997
The Gestapo does its homework.
I'm impressed.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.600
To hell with the Gestapo!

59:28.600 --> 59:31.600
I came here on my own.

59:32.378 --> 59:35.339
I've come to learn of your genius firsthand.

59:35.506 --> 59:39.510
Your promise was incredible.
Why did you stop teaching?

59:39.676 --> 59:43.680
After the war,
I couldn't stand the sight of blood.

59:43.847 --> 59:49.103
So my skill in anatomy
took a different direction.

59:52.189 --> 59:56.443
They're amazing.
What is their secret, please?

59:57.403 --> 01:00:03.492
It was given to me during a trip
I took to Egypt with Elsa 15 years ago.

01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:05.746
It is ancient and very simple.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.600
It is in the archives of every museum
on the continent, it will be found.

01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:14.962
Not so. I have been working on a drug
for over a year to re-instil animation...

01:00:15.129 --> 01:00:20.968
... and all I have is random movement at best.
And even then only for a few minutes.

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:30.602
But I look at your wooden creations,
and they are alive as you and I.

01:00:30.769 --> 01:00:32.688
You had my serum?

01:00:32.855 --> 01:00:35.816
Yes. Completely organic.

01:00:35.983 --> 01:00:38.944
But I have used it but cannot duplicate
what you've done.

01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:41.029
You didn't know your subjects, doctor.

01:00:41.196 --> 01:00:45.200
When I call these puppets my friend,
it is no mere affectation.

01:00:45.367 --> 01:00:48.829
I knew them in life.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.600
Hence, sight of them.

01:00:51.623 --> 01:00:56.879
The book-keeper. Very funny. Full of tricks and practical jokes.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.798
Shot by the Nazis.

01:00:59.965 --> 01:01:07.097
Herman Strauss, truck driver.
Executed for smuggling food to the Jewish ghetto.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:11.518
And Elsa. You were there when they took her from me.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Yes.

01:01:16.648 --> 01:01:18.567
But what gives them life?

01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:19.600
The will to live.

01:01:19.862 --> 01:01:21.951
I knew each of them before they
were cut down by the Nazis...

01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:28.079
... and they all wanted the same thing:
the chance to go on fighting.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.959
That was the difference--they wanted this life after death.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600
They volunteered.

01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:41.507
Yes. The secret of the new life
cannot be duplicated in the laboratory.

01:01:41.673 --> 01:01:44.718
It is the human spirit.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.771
Oh. An Excellent likeness.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:01.318
The reward is 10 000 marks.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:07.199
I don't want your money.
If I show you where Toulon is hiding...

01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:09.660
... all I want is freedom...

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:13.830
... for my wife and my son...

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:18.544
... so that we can leave Berlin and never return.

01:02:24.424 --> 01:02:28.262
First show me where he is.

01:02:33.809 --> 01:02:36.853
As good as new.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.600
Are you going to send one of
your puppets to visit me, Toulon?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600
Not just now.

01:02:49.449 --> 01:02:56.123
At some other time we could have worked together
and done great things.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:15.309
What this means?

01:03:15.517 --> 01:03:20.564
Doctor Hess went there almost an hour ago.
He wanted me to stand guard.

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:24.985
When you see Hess, shoot him.
That's an order.

01:03:25.987 --> 01:03:29.033
- Let me get my son.
- Make it fast.

01:03:46.798 --> 01:03:49.760
Get away from my son.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:53.930
Peter is safe, Hertz.
This is doctor Hess.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:56.016
A friend.

01:03:56.183 --> 01:04:01.563
I don't care who he is.
Stand away from my son.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.600
Now!

01:04:05.567 --> 01:04:08.528
... Peter, come to me.

01:04:08.695 --> 01:04:11.657
- But father...
- Peter!

01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:15.285
Go with your father, Peter.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:27.255
- Who saw you coming here?
- No one.

01:04:49.361 --> 01:04:51.279
- Father, no.
- Be quiet, Peter.

01:04:51.446 --> 01:04:55.701
It's the only way we can be a family.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.600
Quick.

01:04:57.703 --> 01:04:58.578
What about Toulon?

01:04:58.745 --> 01:05:00.600
You don't understand.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.600
We do what we must for mama.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.600
Hands up!

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.600
Come on!

01:06:38.845 --> 01:06:41.433
- Come on! I'd rather see Krauss the butcher dead than you.
- I cannot.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.600
Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry. Hurry.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600
Hurry. Hurry.

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:10.836
Come on, before they come
around the back way.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.600
- Go. They're coming.
- Stop!

01:07:17.425 --> 01:07:20.679
Around the block.
He can't be far.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.367
What did you say to him?
Nothing, Major. I said nothing.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:46.454
- He was warned, yes?
- No.
- He was warned, yes?
- I said nothing.

01:07:48.707 --> 01:07:52.127
Father!
Go, Peter. Run! Run!

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.600
Oh. He's done with.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.100
Keep fighting.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.600
Men like you need to survive.

01:09:58.003 --> 01:10:02.215
Look my friends.
I got us home.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:29.427
I will help you, puppet master.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600
My god.

01:13:22.373 --> 01:13:26.669
Like looking into a mirror, is it not?

01:13:27.587 --> 01:13:33.885
Now you can see what a small man
you really are, Major Krauss.

01:13:35.929 --> 01:13:38.600
Is this what your puppets are for?

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.600
For your temper tantrums?

01:13:42.057 --> 01:13:44.144
You think I'm afraid of this?

01:13:51.569 --> 01:13:54.739
You will be afraid.

01:15:42.096 --> 01:15:45.433
No, Toulon.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600
No!

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.600
No!

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
No!

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.361
Are you travelling alone, Major Krauss?
No.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.600
She'll be boarding in a few minutes.

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:36.627
- Look, mother, dolls.
- Not dolls. Puppets.

01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:40.798
I never heard of a boy playing
with dolls before.

01:17:40.965 --> 01:17:42.884
Where are you and your son travelling?

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.012
- Switzerland.
- And then maybe to America.

01:17:46.179 --> 01:17:48.097
Have you enjoyed Berlin?

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:52.600
No, I have not. I had very unpleasant experience.
I am recuperating.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.600
I hope you're well now.

01:17:55.563 --> 01:17:59.317
Well, some people lost their heads,
but friends saw me through.

01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:05.573
All aboard. The express to Geneva is leaving
from track number 7.
