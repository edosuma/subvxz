00:11.072 --> 00:15.036
Tonight, Richard
drives a muscle car,

00:15.071 --> 00:17.989
I wear some unusual trousers

00:18.024 --> 00:21.040
and there's a wizard in
our reasonably priced car.

00:25.052 --> 00:27.040
APPLAUSE

00:29.068 --> 00:32.060
Hello, thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.

00:32.095 --> 00:34.005
Thank you.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.092
Now, in the past, if you
were a successful businessman

00:37.127 --> 00:40.611
and you wanted a large
four-door saloon car,

00:40.646 --> 00:44.061
you had a choice of
Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi.

00:44.096 --> 00:49.076
Now, though, you could have an Aston
Martin or a Maserati or a Porsche.

00:49.111 --> 00:51.009
And that should, at least,

00:51.044 --> 00:55.024
make the world's financial
districts sound a lot better.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:12.068 --> 01:16.068
These are the cars in question and
it's our job to decide which is best...

01:18.008 --> 01:23.028
The 4.7 litre Maserati
Quattroporte GTS,

01:23.063 --> 01:26.993
the six-litre Aston Martin Rapide

01:27.028 --> 01:32.028
or the extremely ugly
Porsche Panamera Turbo.

01:33.044 --> 01:36.064
This isn't just hideous
compared to the other two -

01:36.099 --> 01:39.052
it's hideous compared to a...
genital wart.

01:40.076 --> 01:44.012
By contrast, looks is where the
Aston gets off to a flying start,

01:44.047 --> 01:47.563
cos it doesn't really
look like a saloon at all.

01:47.598 --> 01:51.045
More like a DB9 that's...
taken a bit of Viagra.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.024
In fact, you have to stare at it for
a while before you can see it's got

01:55.059 --> 01:57.021
four doors at all.

01:57.056 --> 02:01.057
The Quattroporte has now
been with us for six years

02:01.092 --> 02:05.052
but if anything, over that time, I
think it's got even better looking.

02:05.087 --> 02:06.981
Ooh, it has. You're not joking.

02:07.016 --> 02:10.048
When this first came out, I thought
it looked like a Vauxhall Cresta.

02:10.083 --> 02:15.064
Yes, you did. But now, it's just
spectacularly well balanced.

02:15.099 --> 02:17.965
It's just cool, though,
as well, isn't it?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.040
When you see someone getting
out of these, passers by go...

02:21.075 --> 02:22.973
It is like a Mafia hit man.

02:23.008 --> 02:26.028
I like these. Oh, those are...
They work for me.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.045
When you sum up the looks of these,

02:28.080 --> 02:33.016
you've got the ballet dancer, the
hit man and someone who's been...

02:33.051 --> 02:35.060
Found at the bottom of a
lake after two weeks. Yes.

02:35.095 --> 02:37.064
And this is the man who
threw him in there.

02:40.004 --> 02:42.506
Having examined the
outside of the cars,

02:42.541 --> 02:45.008
we thought we'd take
a look at the inside,

02:45.043 --> 02:46.061
where there were some issues.

02:46.096 --> 02:52.032
In the Aston Martin, you need fingers like
cocktail sticks to operate any of the
buttons.

02:53.032 --> 02:57.060
And in the Porsche, you need to be a
rocket scientist to understand anything.

02:57.095 --> 03:00.969
But worst of all is
the Quattroporte.

03:01.004 --> 03:05.002
This is always going to be a bit of a
problem for a small car maker because...

03:05.037 --> 03:09.000
Well, Mercedes-Benz, they've probably
got 1,000 people employed just to decide

03:09.035 --> 03:12.059
where the buttons go on the
satnav, but with the Maserati,

03:12.094 --> 03:15.084
you get the feeling a man
turns up on Tuesday and goes,

03:15.119 --> 03:16.993
"Here is OK."

03:17.028 --> 03:23.004
That's why it's blindingly difficult to operate
everything in here, as we shall now demonstrate.

03:23.039 --> 03:26.056
Chaps, give me a straightforward task.
I'll give you a task.

03:26.091 --> 03:28.056
Adjust the clock. OK.

03:33.068 --> 03:37.092
While James is doing that, Hammond and I
have noticed that we've got these straps
here.

03:37.127 --> 03:40.053
These are fitted for you
to be handcuffed to.

03:40.088 --> 03:45.000
"Don't take me to the warehouse.
I can't find the money!

03:45.035 --> 03:47.021
"Please!" "Just tell me
where my children are. "

03:47.056 --> 03:51.036
Ah, ah, ah! "Set time and date.
" Go on, then. Right, right.

03:52.092 --> 03:54.094
Manual? Semi-automatic?

03:54.129 --> 03:56.096
Oh, these are the weapons.

03:56.131 --> 03:58.001
THEY CHUCKLE

03:58.036 --> 04:01.021
I'm quite good at this sort
of thing but that's rubbish.

04:01.056 --> 04:05.556
At this point, we decided to take
a typical businessman's drive

04:05.591 --> 04:10.056
from here in central London to
a business park in Hampshire.

04:12.076 --> 04:14.076
I wanted to drive the Maserati.

04:14.111 --> 04:16.005
Toodle-oo.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.017
Well, I'm not driving the
Porsche. I'm just not.

04:19.052 --> 04:23.076
'Unfortunately, while I was telling
Jeremy I wouldn't drive the Porsche...

04:24.096 --> 04:27.032
'.. James drove off in the Aston. '

04:28.076 --> 04:32.086
Oh God. Why did I have
to get stuck with this?

04:32.121 --> 04:36.096
I grabbed the Aston,
expecting perfection.

04:36.131 --> 04:38.993
But I didn't quite find it.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.064
You pay 91,000 for the Maserati,

04:41.099 --> 04:43.583
97,000 for the Porsche

04:43.618 --> 04:46.811
and then 140,000 for this.

04:46.846 --> 04:49.969
But I'm not exactly sure why.

04:50.004 --> 04:54.024
For that sort of money, this thing
has to be absolutely brilliant

04:54.059 --> 04:56.020
but I'm not entirely
convinced it is.

04:56.055 --> 04:57.973
It's a bit jiggly.

04:58.008 --> 04:59.061
I know it's a sort of supercar,

04:59.096 --> 05:03.012
but it's supposed to be luxurious
and comfortable as well.

05:04.032 --> 05:09.036
When it comes to criticism, though, you
should have heard Mr Grumble-Trousers.

05:09.071 --> 05:11.973
It's sort of massive
for one thing -

05:12.008 --> 05:14.020
I'm scared I might
knock over a building.

05:15.084 --> 05:16.053
Oh God.

05:16.088 --> 05:19.001
It's got a stop-start,

05:19.036 --> 05:23.084
so the engine stops when you stop and
starts when you hit the pedal to move away.

05:23.119 --> 05:25.589
What's...? To save petrol.

05:25.624 --> 05:28.025
In a 4.7 litre V8 turbo.

05:28.060 --> 05:33.080
That's like buying Buckingham Palace, then
living in the kitchen to save wearing the
carpets out.

05:33.115 --> 05:36.029
Then there's the pricing.

05:36.064 --> 05:41.029
Yes, at L97,000, this does look like
good value against the Aston Martin.

05:41.064 --> 05:46.076
Then you discover you have to pay extra
for things like the rear windscreen wiper.

05:46.111 --> 05:51.008
Don't be tight. 97 grand - chuck
in a windscreen wiper, eh?

05:51.043 --> 05:54.969
Hammond. Yep?I don't
like looking at your car.

05:55.004 --> 05:59.088
It's the only thing that brightens my day
knowing you have got to look at it and I haven't.

05:59.123 --> 06:03.000
No, there's its reflection!
God, it's hideous.

06:04.060 --> 06:08.080
Up ahead, there was a chance for
the Porsche to redeem itself.

06:08.115 --> 06:10.084
Ooh, hello. Tunnel.

06:13.044 --> 06:15.096
There it is. Sport.

06:19.036 --> 06:20.057
No noise at all.

06:20.092 --> 06:23.090
On a 4.7 litre V8, and...

06:23.125 --> 06:26.053
I can't hear anything.

06:26.088 --> 06:30.056
'The Aston put on a better show. '

06:30.091 --> 06:31.993
Not bad.

06:32.028 --> 06:34.013
'But then came the Maserati. '

06:34.048 --> 06:38.032
What I'm going to do now
is push the sport button.

06:38.067 --> 06:40.044
ENGINE REVS LOUDLY

06:41.044 --> 06:44.013
Oh, my God! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:44.048 --> 06:50.032
What this button does is it
turns carbon dioxide into noise.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.028
'However, like the other
two, I had complaints. '

06:55.063 --> 06:59.013
The sports noise - that's good.

06:59.048 --> 07:04.048
The trouble is they've also fitted it with
sports suspension and that's not good.

07:05.044 --> 07:09.049
If you can afford L100,000
to spend on a car,

07:09.084 --> 07:14.012
chances are you're a bit old, and old
people don't want to drive along like this.

07:14.047 --> 07:15.557
That's not comfy.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.033
'And there was more. '

07:17.068 --> 07:21.060
I honestly thought James was
being stupid, but he isn't.

07:21.095 --> 07:23.969
I can't fathom anything out.

07:24.004 --> 07:27.056
There are buttons I've just found
on the back of the steering wheel -

07:27.091 --> 07:30.056
six of them. No idea what they do.

07:34.036 --> 07:38.548
'On the uneventful one-hour
cruise to the business park... '

07:38.583 --> 07:43.060
HE SNIGGERS Do I care that I don't
knowwhat the buttons do? No.

07:45.004 --> 07:47.029
'.. I worked out a way to describe

07:47.064 --> 07:50.997
'the unhinged but
bewitching Quattroporte. '

07:51.032 --> 07:53.969
Owning this car is like
owning a two-year-old child.

07:54.004 --> 07:58.092
It's really annoying for a lot of the time
but if someone tried to take it away from
you...

07:58.127 --> 08:00.033
You'd kill them. You'd kill!

08:00.068 --> 08:05.060
'Then, since the park was closed, we
decided to turn it into a race track.

08:07.028 --> 08:12.008
'And in the Maserati, Hammond
quickly got what I was on about. '

08:12.043 --> 08:13.052
Oh, my word!

08:21.004 --> 08:26.000
This is a four-door saloon car but
it sounds utterly magnificent.

08:26.035 --> 08:27.045
It's just got so much style.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.969
I don't care what the flaws are -

08:30.004 --> 08:33.052
I don't care if it picks its nose and
farts in bed - I love this thing.

08:33.087 --> 08:38.000
It's got such a sense of fun about it.
That is the whole point.

08:38.034 --> 08:40.092
Even if you're trying
to keep that lid down.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.020
'Mind you, the Aston
wasn't bad either. '

08:47.028 --> 08:50.092
Do you know what this is?
I'll tell you exactly what this is.

08:50.127 --> 08:52.028
It is exciting.

08:54.028 --> 08:57.092
There's a subtle, refined
rage to this car.

09:01.084 --> 09:06.058
It is not as sharp as a
Vantage or DB9 or DBS,

09:06.093 --> 09:11.032
but as a four-door saloon
car, it's spectacular.

09:11.067 --> 09:14.973
'Here on the business park raceway,

09:15.008 --> 09:19.056
'even the four-wheel drive Elephant
Man is making a case for itself. '

09:19.091 --> 09:22.024
God above! This thing's great.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.028
It feels big, but whoo!

09:29.036 --> 09:30.060
Staggering.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.969
I'm just amazed by this car.

09:36.004 --> 09:40.032
Dynamically, it is as fabulous
as it is gopping to look at.

09:42.004 --> 09:45.969
'Frankly, we could have fooled
about all day in these cars,

09:46.004 --> 09:49.076
'but we decided to induce a bit
of science by laying out a course

09:49.111 --> 09:52.072
'and then summoning the
head of accounts. '

09:59.084 --> 10:03.032
Is he ready? Yes, believe so.
Of course he is - he's the Stig.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.052
Three, two, one, go.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.020
They sold 1,000... Ssh!

10:14.048 --> 10:15.997
What were you going to say?

10:16.032 --> 10:20.017
I was going to say that they sold 1,000
of those Maseratis over a five-year period

10:20.052 --> 10:25.084
but over the save same five years,they sold
nearly 15,000 MercedesS Classes. He's
coming back!

10:32.028 --> 10:34.064
You know the Ferrari F438?

10:34.099 --> 10:36.036
What?!

10:39.024 --> 10:41.028
He got a bit squirrely there.

10:44.016 --> 10:45.076
I've had a crisis!

10:45.111 --> 10:46.061
35.8.

10:46.096 --> 10:49.044
'With the Maserati's
time on the board... '

10:51.004 --> 10:53.052
'.. the Stig lined up the Aston. '

10:53.087 --> 10:57.016
Three, two, one, and go.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.064
I'm very angry!

11:07.064 --> 11:11.004
But why is it so expensive?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.036
I think they're charging
140,000 cos they can. Yeah.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.056
Ooh! He is brave. Isn't he brave?

11:26.088 --> 11:29.546
OK, the Aston Martin Rapide.

11:29.581 --> 11:33.004
There's your Maserati, 35.81.

11:33.039 --> 11:35.057
Rapide...

11:35.092 --> 11:37.041
35.25. Ooh!

11:37.076 --> 11:40.001
So 50 grand and you go

11:40.036 --> 11:43.985
0.6 of a second faster round
Farnborough business park.

11:44.020 --> 11:48.044
It is an important pieceof consumer advice.
I'd spend an extra 50 grand for that.

11:48.079 --> 11:50.060
Right. It's time now...

11:50.095 --> 11:53.004
for the Porsche.

11:55.012 --> 11:58.056
Three, two, one, go.

11:59.088 --> 12:00.993
Has it gone?

12:01.028 --> 12:04.044
You two haven't given it the
full beans yet, have you?

12:04.079 --> 12:06.024
No. It's absolutely astonishing.

12:12.076 --> 12:15.048
I have to say, I like the
look ofit now. You can't...

12:15.083 --> 12:17.040
No, it's behind that building.

12:23.088 --> 12:26.000
It's back! I've got to look.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.048
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

12:35.044 --> 12:37.004
Right.

12:38.092 --> 12:41.005
The Porsche did it in...

12:41.040 --> 12:45.021
35.1, which is only a
tenth of a second faster,

12:45.056 --> 12:49.053
but nevertheless, that thing, I
think, is astonishingly fast.

12:49.088 --> 12:53.072
It is. That's all very well, but which would
you rather walk out to in the morning?

12:53.107 --> 12:56.061
The Maserati or the Aston that'll
make your trousers go all hot,

12:56.096 --> 13:01.052
or the Porsche - they do! - which makes a bit
of sick come into your mouth when you see it.

13:01.087 --> 13:04.032
Which would you rather have?
That's the thing.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.039
HE BLOWS A RASPBERRY

13:06.074 --> 13:07.977
Nobody's watching.

13:08.012 --> 13:10.088
Nobody is actually
in there, are they?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.981
You've all come along and you...

13:13.016 --> 13:17.036
The World Cup is on BBC One and ITV.
How many people do you think are watching?

13:17.071 --> 13:20.092
We could just talk in a high-pitched squeak.
Eek, eek! It's just us.

13:20.127 --> 13:23.001
Why don't you get naked?
Go on. LAUGHTER

13:23.036 --> 13:26.092
Anyway, I have a theoryabout
those cars. Oh, God! Joy

13:26.127 --> 13:28.061
It's one of my better
theories, this is.

13:28.096 --> 13:31.084
If I were a businessman and I
were invited to go and do business

13:31.119 --> 13:34.072
on a business park in
Hampshire, I'd use Skype.

13:34.107 --> 13:36.025
Not go, yeah. I wouldn't go,

13:36.060 --> 13:39.005
but if I had an Aston, a
Maserati or even the Porsche,

13:39.040 --> 13:43.016
I would drive down there becausethey make...
Your day more special?

13:43.051 --> 13:45.965
They make driving more special.
For that reason alone,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.993
I like them more than the
established BMs and Mercs and Audis.

13:49.028 --> 13:53.008
We haven't finished with them yet
there'll be more testing later,

13:53.043 --> 13:56.020
sort of, but for now it's
the news. Yes, it is,

13:56.055 --> 13:58.017
and talking about the
Porsche Panamera,

13:58.052 --> 14:03.084
you would think, would you not, that it's
impossible to make that car any uglier. Yes.

14:03.119 --> 14:06.053
The ugliest thing in the world.
Well, it is.

14:06.088 --> 14:10.060
There's a Swiss company called
Mansory and here is their creation.

14:10.095 --> 14:13.060
It actually is uglier, isn't it?

14:13.095 --> 14:15.005
I'm going to be sick.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.045
That is... How much is it?

14:16.080 --> 14:19.088
L133,000, they want
for that monstrosity!

14:19.123 --> 14:22.096
I like the interior best of all.
Have a look.

14:24.036 --> 14:27.024
It's like the set of a
children's television programme.

14:27.059 --> 14:28.993
All it needs is a
ball pit down here,

14:29.028 --> 14:31.021
and then they've pretty
much got it finished.

14:31.056 --> 14:34.969
Anyone go to the Goodwood Festival
of Speed last weekend? Several.

14:35.004 --> 14:38.524
I wasn't able to make it, but I'm told
they had a moving motor show there.

14:38.559 --> 14:42.044
The idea was, unlike a normal motor
show, where the cars just sit still,

14:42.079 --> 14:44.969
you can jump in and have a go,

14:45.004 --> 14:49.012
which sounds like a great idea, unless you're
one of the four people who were run over.

14:49.047 --> 14:50.057
LAUGHTER

14:50.092 --> 14:54.049
Seriously! I've got a picture here.
Somebody got in a Honda Civic.

14:54.084 --> 14:59.044
Is there any danger that these Goodwood
people might take over the Farnborough Air
Show?

15:00.096 --> 15:04.033
"Next seven for a go in
the Red Arrows. Come on. "

15:04.068 --> 15:09.040
"Welcome to the Goodwood interactive zoo.
Now, who wants to do lion taming?" It
doesn't work.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.061
The Goodwood Festival
of Live Ammunition.

15:11.096 --> 15:14.088
"Are there actual bullets in these guns?
Is there a range?!"

15:14.123 --> 15:17.028
"No, just help yourself.
That's fantastic!"

15:17.063 --> 15:18.025
LAUGHTER

15:18.060 --> 15:21.977
Couple of weeks ago, you may remember
we announced that Ferrari had broken

15:22.012 --> 15:26.096
the lap record at the Nurburgring. They did
it in six minutes and 58 seconds. Great!

15:26.131 --> 15:31.000
But already, Pagani have broken
that with this, the Zonda R,

15:31.035 --> 15:33.045
and they've gone round
it in six minutes and 40.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.068
We've got some footage of them
doing it here. Here we go.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.977
Obviously, it's just
very, very fast.

15:39.012 --> 15:42.552
Wait a minute. Is this a road car?Well, yes.
I mean, you can drive it on the road.

15:42.587 --> 15:46.092
Well, the real point is this isa record...
Well, it's not a shopping car, obviously.

15:46.127 --> 15:50.064
I see. So this road car with firecoming
out of the back... Well done, them.

15:50.099 --> 15:53.549
Now, I'm going to tell you
something very important.

15:53.584 --> 15:57.000
The European Union, which
is a big thing in Belgium...

15:57.035 --> 15:57.969
LAUGHTER

15:58.004 --> 16:01.045
It is! They've decided
that all car makers

16:01.080 --> 16:05.066
must reach an average target
for their whole range of car.

16:05.101 --> 16:09.562
So here's how it works, OK?
If BMW sell a V12 limousine,

16:09.597 --> 16:14.024
they must then sell lots of
little Diesel 1 Series cars

16:14.059 --> 16:16.059
to keep the average
of the CO2 down.

16:16.094 --> 16:18.060
It's averaged across
the range of cars?

16:18.095 --> 16:19.993
Now, Bugatti, it's not so bad,

16:20.028 --> 16:22.025
because Bugatti's
owned by Volkswagen,

16:22.060 --> 16:26.016
and Volkswagen also makes
the Polo, so that's fine.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.021
But Aston Martin -
bit of a problem,

16:29.056 --> 16:32.009
cos Aston Martin isn't owned
by VW or Ford, it's on its own.

16:32.044 --> 16:36.057
And they only make big cars. Onlybig,
thirsty cars. They've got toget that
average down,

16:36.092 --> 16:41.072
so they've had to make a small car, OK? And
we have a picture of it here. It's called
the Cygnet.

16:41.107 --> 16:43.591
AUDIENCE GROAN This is
potentially disastrous,

16:43.626 --> 16:46.041
because it risks ruining
their reputation.

16:46.076 --> 16:49.045
What that is is a Toyota
iQ with a leather gear knob

16:49.080 --> 16:53.025
and then Toyota crossed out and
Aston Martin written in in crayon.

16:53.060 --> 16:58.016
That's what that is. Hang on a minute. If
they just need to bring their average CO2 down,

16:58.051 --> 17:01.045
why don't they just
buy a bicycle factory?

17:01.080 --> 17:04.005
Or they should do
Aston Martin flowers,

17:04.040 --> 17:08.025
cos they suck in CO2 and put out oxygen,
and that would bring it crashing down!

17:08.060 --> 17:13.003
I think it has to be a mode of transport -
you can't go to work on some flowers. A horse?

17:13.039 --> 17:17.008
Scissors. Have you ever tried
sitting on a pair of scissors?

17:17.042 --> 17:19.045
LAUGHTER Not yet.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.060
A cow. Ostriches.
They're quite exotic.

17:22.096 --> 17:27.044
Another one I've just thought of isZonda.
What are Zonda going to do?Oh, that'll be easy.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.009
Well, they're Italian, aren't they?

17:29.044 --> 17:31.985
They'll just lie -
that's what they'll do.

17:32.020 --> 17:35.096
"Emissions is very important! Is it low
or high? Low? OK. My emissions is one!"

17:35.131 --> 17:37.111
And that's it. They'll just lie.

17:37.146 --> 17:39.057
Well, why don't
Aston Martin just...

17:39.092 --> 17:42.009
Why not take a leaf out of
the European book and say,

17:42.044 --> 17:45.053
"Yes, our cars don't really
produce carbon dioxide at all. "

17:45.088 --> 17:50.052
If you say... The EU go and inspect a Spanish
fishing boat and go, "Have you been fishing?"

17:50.087 --> 17:53.032
"No. " "What's all that in
your boat?" "My lunch. "

17:53.067 --> 17:55.037
"It's a lot of fish. Hungry!"

17:55.072 --> 17:58.005
This is the answer. Don't make
that, Aston Martin. Just lie.

17:58.040 --> 18:03.016
Anyway, I tell you what, you know
the American stunt driver Ken Block?

18:03.051 --> 18:05.065
Yes. You know who I mean.
Excellent.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.080
You went to see him in California.

18:07.115 --> 18:09.021
Yes, I did.

18:09.056 --> 18:13.016
Some footage here of Ken terrifying
the bejesus out of James, look.

18:15.016 --> 18:17.025
So he dropped in on us last week,

18:17.060 --> 18:21.084
and he called me a pussy for not
being able to drive a Reliant Robin.

18:21.119 --> 18:22.993
You are.

18:23.028 --> 18:26.072
You are a pussy. A big, irritating one.
You say that, but last week,

18:26.107 --> 18:30.005
the Stig tried to drive the Reliant Robin.
He also rolled over.

18:30.040 --> 18:35.028
Yeah. Yes, so are you stayingthe Stig's
a pussy? No. No. There you are, you see.

18:35.063 --> 18:38.053
Well, let's have a look because Kenhad a go.
He looks good, doesn't he?

18:38.088 --> 18:43.020
He won't be able to do it. He will. I'm
telling you, he will not be able to do it.

18:45.055 --> 18:46.025
He has perfect car control.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.061
He won't be able to do it.
And here he is.

18:48.096 --> 18:51.096
The first corner, nice and smooth.
He's keeping the line wide,

18:51.131 --> 18:54.024
using all the track.
It's a lovely...

18:57.040 --> 19:00.021
That's not gone well, has it?
My case rests.

19:00.056 --> 19:04.008
You can't drive one of those
things round a corner!

19:04.043 --> 19:04.977
Right.

19:05.012 --> 19:10.040
Now, it is time to put a Formula 1
star in our old, reasonably priced car.

19:10.075 --> 19:14.021
My guest tonight is a Brazilian.

19:14.056 --> 19:18.057
Not the triangular
topiary thing, obviously.

19:18.092 --> 19:22.080
It is a genuine Brazilian. Ladies
and gentlemen, Rubens Barrichello!

19:22.115 --> 19:25.076
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

19:25.111 --> 19:27.965
Rubens!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.026
How're you? Nice to see you.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.052
Rubens is among us. Thank you.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.032
Have a seat.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.084
Have a seat!

19:39.084 --> 19:42.013
I've got a question, if I may.

19:42.048 --> 19:45.092
Why has your country
given its name to...

19:45.127 --> 19:47.065
How can I put this?

19:47.100 --> 19:49.004
.. triangular topiary?

19:49.039 --> 19:50.025
LAUGHTER

19:50.060 --> 19:52.558
I think it's a term
used in England,

19:52.593 --> 19:55.056
because in Brazil we
call it "Hitlers".

19:55.091 --> 19:57.077
A what?LAUGHTER

19:57.112 --> 19:59.029
It's a little...

19:59.064 --> 20:02.040
You're saying you'd have a Hitler?
A Hitler there.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.024
Has anybody here got a Brazilian?

20:04.059 --> 20:08.008
You have, sir? Er... LAUGHTER

20:08.043 --> 20:10.061
HE MUTTERS Anyway...

20:10.096 --> 20:14.036
Obviously, it was Silverstone this
afternoon. Well done for winning.

20:14.071 --> 20:15.045
Thank you!

20:15.080 --> 20:18.989
Nasty crash. Yeah. LAUGHTER

20:19.024 --> 20:22.060
Should've covered it there.
I should explain it is now Wednesday,

20:22.095 --> 20:23.049
and we have no idea...

20:23.084 --> 20:26.076
I'm just thinking - that will be...
How many races is it

20:26.111 --> 20:29.004
you will have done
by this evening, now?

20:29.039 --> 20:31.033
297. 297.

20:31.068 --> 20:35.016
Is that a record now? Have you set
the record for the most Grands Prix?

20:35.051 --> 20:36.989
Yeah. When I raced
for the first time,

20:37.024 --> 20:40.028
I never thought I would
race for such a long period,

20:40.063 --> 20:43.057
but I'm enjoying
more than I used to.

20:43.092 --> 20:46.017
Cos you must now
be, what, 78? Yeah!

20:46.052 --> 20:49.068
Anyway, you're now driving for
one of the great teams, Williams.

20:49.103 --> 20:51.017
Well, I tell you, it's...

20:51.052 --> 20:55.004
Since a very young kid,
when I was driving go-karts,

20:55.039 --> 20:56.973
I have interviews
when people ask me,

20:57.008 --> 20:59.053
"Which team would you like to drive?
", and it was for Williams.

20:59.088 --> 21:03.076
Why was that?I don't know. I just
hada great passion for Frank Williams,

21:03.111 --> 21:05.965
and you can see it nowadays -

21:06.000 --> 21:08.993
he is so passionate
about everything,

21:09.028 --> 21:12.017
and I'm trying to lead the
team to a different area.

21:12.052 --> 21:16.004
They are changing, and I think
the future is quite bright.

21:16.039 --> 21:18.981
So, um, Ferrari - just
to go there, obviously.

21:19.016 --> 21:23.016
You had that period where you were
there with His Schumacherness.

21:23.051 --> 21:24.977
You must have known
when you got there

21:25.012 --> 21:28.000
that you were going to be,
effectively, the whipping boy.

21:28.035 --> 21:29.965
I did not. Really? You didn't...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.053
That's the funny bit,
because people say,

21:32.088 --> 21:38.048
"Shut up, Rubens. You knew you were
going to play second in the team. "

21:38.083 --> 21:41.025
And when I signed,
I made sure to ask,

21:41.060 --> 21:44.074
"Is it everything to him or
am I going to have a chance?"

21:44.109 --> 21:47.088
And in my contract it was zero.
There was no mentioning

21:47.123 --> 21:50.029
of becoming a second driver there.

21:50.064 --> 21:54.056
So you were very surprised... It was
Austria, where you were winning, he was
behind you,

21:54.091 --> 21:59.024
and then the call came through... "Would
you mind awfully getting out of his way?"

21:59.059 --> 22:01.563
Was that a big surprise?
It was almost like that.

22:01.598 --> 22:04.319
People ask me, "Why did
he do on the last corner?"

22:04.354 --> 22:07.005
Because in my mind, I was
never going to do it.

22:07.040 --> 22:12.004
It was eight laps. You know, it was
almost like the lawyer was sitting here

22:12.039 --> 22:16.037
and people, you know,there was a
discussion going on. Back at the pit?

22:16.072 --> 22:21.016
Yeah. And I could only say,"No, I'm not
going to do it. "Did you actually say that?

22:21.051 --> 22:24.057
I said, "I'm not going to do
it," until the very final bit

22:24.092 --> 22:27.061
when they were a bit more focused
on saying something that I...

22:27.096 --> 22:32.000
Did they say, "We've got one of your
pets here. NOW will you move over

22:32.035 --> 22:35.000
"and let him go by?
"It was almost like that, yeah.

23:10.035 --> 23:12.001
Anyway, of course,
you came down here

23:12.036 --> 23:16.049
because we have our Formula
1 board here, yes? Yes.

23:16.084 --> 23:20.060
And you wanted to see where you'd
come in our old reasonably-priced car,

23:20.095 --> 23:23.024
the old Liana, which has been
gathering dust somewhere.

23:23.059 --> 23:24.577
Was it fun? It was fun.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.061
Really? Yeah, it was.

23:26.096 --> 23:29.021
Cos you think, you
know, I drive this car

23:29.056 --> 23:33.534
with so much power and everything,
but it's a different challenge.

23:33.569 --> 23:38.012
I mean, when you step on the
brakes, that back end, you know...

23:38.047 --> 23:40.969
So smoothness is what...
Keep it quite smooth.

23:41.004 --> 23:44.036
Well, I think the time has come.
I hope it was a good one.

23:44.071 --> 23:47.036
Well, shall we find out?
Who wants to see the lap?

23:47.071 --> 23:49.977
Yes! OK, let's play the tape.

23:50.012 --> 23:53.036
It's nice to see the old girl back.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.572
Now, concentrate. Remember that
I drive normally on that side.

23:59.607 --> 24:03.064
Well, that's your fault for driving
on the wrong side of the road.

24:03.099 --> 24:06.049
That's the Stig's
line through there.

24:06.084 --> 24:09.090
All the other F1 drivers
come way further out.

24:09.125 --> 24:12.096
Well, he talked me into that.
I thought it was...

24:12.131 --> 24:15.025
You see? "Come on, horse. "

24:15.060 --> 24:17.977
It's not a horse, but there we are.

24:18.012 --> 24:22.020
What can I say? I'm not going to say,
"Oh, that's not very good," am I?

24:22.055 --> 24:26.029
Very good down to the Hammerhead.
This is a difficult part.

24:26.064 --> 24:30.048
It is. It normally makes the car
understeer there, but you've got it.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.985
How come you can do that and
all our guests just can't?

24:33.020 --> 24:37.028
RUBENS CHUCKLES I suppose that's cos
they're mostlyactors or comedians.

24:37.063 --> 24:39.024
Wave to the camera?

24:39.059 --> 24:40.053
HE GROANS

24:40.088 --> 24:43.033
The gear! The gear just went "grr".

24:43.068 --> 24:46.092
Well, it must be strange for you
to actually have to change...

24:46.127 --> 24:48.989
When was the last
time you changed gear?

24:49.024 --> 24:52.032
You know what, I started Formula 1
and it was already the automatic.

24:52.067 --> 24:55.032
Yeah. And I bet your road car has...
What's your road car?

24:55.067 --> 24:57.068
My road... I have a...

24:57.103 --> 24:59.977
An M5.

25:00.012 --> 25:02.021
Flappy pedal. So you
haven't changed gear for...

25:02.056 --> 25:06.036
Ooh! Look at that.
Lovely through the second to last.

25:06.071 --> 25:10.016
And here we are now.
What's the time? Give me the time!

25:10.051 --> 25:12.064
APPLAUSE There we are
crossed the line.

25:19.028 --> 25:21.084
So we've got the Stig at 1:44.4.

25:21.119 --> 25:23.017
Mansell 1:44.6,

25:23.052 --> 25:26.562
and then Lewis did that
with a wet lap at 1:44.7,

25:26.597 --> 25:30.322
which was fairly remarkable.
Impressive. Then Mark.

25:30.357 --> 25:34.048
He flew around, actually.
Just decided not to bother.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.049
So where do you reckon?

25:35.084 --> 25:38.544
I don't know. My heart
is beating more than

25:38.579 --> 25:42.004
at the start of the
Silverstone GP, I tell you.

25:42.039 --> 25:45.028
This is obviously a
more popular show.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.092
I have the time here. OK.

25:49.127 --> 25:52.063
Rubens Barichello...

25:52.098 --> 25:54.069
You did it in...

25:54.104 --> 25:56.005
One minute...

25:56.040 --> 25:58.985
Well, that's really...

25:59.020 --> 26:03.084
.. forty... I'm on the page, then.
You're on the page!

26:03.119 --> 26:07.040
.. four... AUDIENCE: Ooh!

26:07.075 --> 26:09.041
.. point... Point?

26:09.076 --> 26:12.088
.. three!CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

26:12.123 --> 26:15.053
44.3! Wow!

26:15.088 --> 26:20.004
The fastest man ever
to go round our track!

26:21.032 --> 26:22.548
Fantastic!

26:22.583 --> 26:24.029
Unbelievable.

26:24.064 --> 26:26.048
Wow! That is fantastic.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.037
I am so proud.

26:28.072 --> 26:32.012
It's fantastic and
it's also staggering

26:32.047 --> 26:34.045
that you should have beaten him.

26:34.080 --> 26:38.548
We need to get you out of this
building in some careful way now.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.981
Yeah. I can't imagine he's going
to be very pleased about this.

26:43.016 --> 26:47.036
Especially cos if we get into a
fight, he never takes his helmet off!

26:47.071 --> 26:49.076
There you go. You've finally
won something today.

26:49.111 --> 26:52.040
LAUGHTER

26:53.040 --> 26:56.546
You'll take a piece of that.
It was good 11 wins.

26:56.581 --> 27:00.052
There we are. That is a
truly staggering thing.

27:00.087 --> 27:02.057
I will ask for more
money from Frank now.

27:02.092 --> 27:06.068
You can now say, "I am the fastest
Formula 1 driver in the world,

27:06.103 --> 27:09.067
"and more than that, I'm
faster than the Stig. "

27:09.102 --> 27:12.032
Fantastic. Ladies and
gentlemen, Rubens Barrichello.

27:12.067 --> 27:14.024
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

27:24.092 --> 27:26.033
Now...

27:26.068 --> 27:29.066
There are a couple of
new muscle cars out

27:29.101 --> 27:32.029
that we thought were
worth a look at.

27:32.064 --> 27:36.012
And clearly the right man for
the job is someone who has owned

27:36.047 --> 27:40.029
a Dodge Charger and a
Ford Mustang and a banjo.

27:40.064 --> 27:45.044
Yep, it's our resident
redneck, the Duke of Hammond.

27:48.016 --> 27:51.024
This is the first of
today's offerings.

27:55.004 --> 27:57.064
A muscle car icon, reborn.

27:57.099 --> 27:59.088
The Chevrolet Camaro.

28:02.044 --> 28:04.037
Jeremy has a theory
about the Camaro.

28:04.072 --> 28:07.001
He believes that all Camaros
are driven by murderers,

28:07.036 --> 28:10.084
and you should never accept a lift in
one cos your head'll end up swinging

28:10.119 --> 28:12.080
in the rear-view mirror
as an air freshener.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
The thing is, there's a bit
more to this Camaro than that.

28:19.028 --> 28:25.008
Now if you're under 12, then to you, this
car is Bumblebee from the Transformers
movies.

28:25.043 --> 28:28.084
In a minute, it's going to stand up
and throw an oil tanker at my face.

28:28.119 --> 28:33.056
But back in the '60s, its grandfather
was fighting the Cold War.

28:34.032 --> 28:38.985
Not the big scary one with the
Russians, but the Detroit Cold War.

28:39.020 --> 28:45.012
In 1964, Ford had launched the most
famous muscle car of all, the Mustang.

28:45.047 --> 28:49.040
And two years later,
GM struck back.

28:50.064 --> 28:55.000
Camaro! Fiery new
creation from Chevrolet!

28:57.000 --> 28:59.064
It was one hell of a battle.

28:59.099 --> 29:00.977
And the Camaro...

29:01.012 --> 29:03.076
Well, it lost, actually.

29:03.111 --> 29:04.045
Quite badly.

29:04.080 --> 29:09.060
In its first full year, Ford sold
over half a million Mustangs.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.060
In its first full
year with the Camaro,

29:11.095 --> 29:14.969
GM didn't manage even half of that.

29:15.004 --> 29:20.092
The other muscle cars - Mustangs, Chargers -
they went on to starring roles in Bullitt.

29:20.127 --> 29:25.060
The Camaro did once have quite a
nice role in an episode of Lovejoy.

29:29.008 --> 29:32.981
But this new boy is
coming back fighting.

29:33.016 --> 29:39.036
This is the SS version - the most
powerful - with a 6.2 litre V8.

29:39.071 --> 29:43.072
And at L40,000, it is a
lot of car for the money.

29:47.072 --> 29:48.997
It also looks good

29:49.032 --> 29:51.985
and unlike other muscle cars,

29:52.020 --> 29:55.056
the suspension isn't made
from lampposts and logs.

29:59.052 --> 30:01.025
Because underneath the Camaro

30:01.060 --> 30:06.068
is the chassis from one our very
favouritest saloon cars, the Vauxhall VXR8.

30:06.103 --> 30:09.008
It's made by the Australians.

30:12.092 --> 30:16.004
Which means there's a lot of
multi-link cleverness going on.

30:21.008 --> 30:25.008
So basically, the Americans had to go to the
Australians for a bit of sophistication.

30:28.028 --> 30:29.033
That feels more like it!

30:29.068 --> 30:31.989
A good effort all round
and on any other day,

30:32.024 --> 30:35.072
the Camaro could claim to be
the muscle car of the moment.

30:39.016 --> 30:42.538
However, it must now face this -

30:42.573 --> 30:46.060
a muscle car, not from America...

30:48.056 --> 30:52.096
.. the very German
Mercedes E63 AMG.

30:57.008 --> 30:58.516
Listen to that!

30:58.551 --> 30:59.989
ENGINE ROARS

31:00.024 --> 31:01.096
It's the AMG dawn chorus.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.989
It might look like a
businessman's express,

31:07.024 --> 31:13.032
but when it comes to noise, the Benz
it blows the Camaro out of the water.

31:13.067 --> 31:17.028
This thing sounds like Lynyrd
Skynyrd at a bullfight.

31:20.048 --> 31:23.044
And when you take it
beyond 5,000rpm...

31:27.048 --> 31:29.005
Ah-ha!

31:29.040 --> 31:34.068
Although the Mercedes, like the
Camaro, has a 6.2 litre V8,

31:34.103 --> 31:37.044
it's faster and more powerful.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.032
0-60, 4.5 seconds.

31:49.068 --> 31:51.973
Top speed, normally
limited to 155mph.

31:52.008 --> 31:58.072
Or for L2,230, you can have
the limit raised to 186...

31:58.107 --> 32:00.061
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

32:00.096 --> 32:05.004
.. almost 40 more than
the Camaro will do.

32:13.068 --> 32:18.048
There are, however, a couple
of chinks in the AMG's armour.

32:18.083 --> 32:25.004
Where the Camaro costs
L40,000, this is 72,000.

32:26.080 --> 32:30.540
A muscle car should also be a
car for simpletons, like me,

32:30.575 --> 32:34.965
but there are more gizmos in
here than Bill Gates's kitchen.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.040
The gearbox, for example, can be
operated from here or down here,

32:38.075 --> 32:40.076
and then this dial splits it
into four different modes -

32:40.111 --> 32:42.985
comfort, sport, sport
plus and so on.

32:43.020 --> 32:47.052
This button adjusts the traction
control, lots of settings there.

32:47.087 --> 32:50.013
This button is for the ride,
lots of different settings.

32:50.048 --> 32:56.020
And that's a lot to think about if you're
the kind of person who goes to work in a
vest.

32:59.016 --> 33:01.989
Thankfully, help is at hand.

33:02.024 --> 33:05.981
It's this the fourth button
here, the AMG button.

33:06.016 --> 33:11.008
Essentially, it takes all the other
settings from all the other buttons and
puts them in a thing,

33:11.043 --> 33:15.028
and then when you hit this button, it
sets the car up exactly as you want it.

33:16.052 --> 33:19.024
I like mine like this.

33:27.060 --> 33:30.993
With the button in what
I call redneck setting,

33:31.028 --> 33:36.084
the AMG can outslide, outturn and
outrun any muscle car on the planet.

33:38.048 --> 33:41.096
I'm in a massive German
executive saloon.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.084
Going sideways!

33:56.080 --> 34:01.052
The Mercedes may be almost twice
the price of the Camaro...

34:07.008 --> 34:10.047
.. but, the fact is,
it's twice the car.

34:19.012 --> 34:21.060
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:24.068 --> 34:26.021
The thing is...

34:26.056 --> 34:28.021
The thing is I just...

34:28.056 --> 34:32.989
I just love muscle cars as a breed, because
I love the idea you take an ordinary, basic
car

34:33.024 --> 34:38.076
and then you keep adding more and more and more
and more and more power until it's just about unusable,

34:38.110 --> 34:42.040
and then you put it on
sale and people buy it.

34:42.074 --> 34:44.989
And you'd have the Mercedes? Nope.

34:45.024 --> 34:46.989
I know I said the
Merc is twice the car.

34:47.024 --> 34:50.052
I'd have the Camaro, it's just got
much more soul. It's a stupid car!

34:50.087 --> 34:51.025
It's a brilliant car...

34:51.060 --> 34:54.045
OK, things you'll never
hear as somebody gets in.

34:54.080 --> 34:59.004
"I'd just like to thank the Nobel
Academy and now I'm going home. "

34:59.039 --> 35:03.032
Or how about this one?
"No, really, let me, Your Majesty. "

35:03.067 --> 35:05.965
There's nobody intelligent...

35:06.000 --> 35:09.029
"Bishop Tutu, can I have a go?
Thank you, I will. "

35:09.064 --> 35:14.068
It is a car for a type of person,
I love it! It's a stupid, childish...

35:14.103 --> 35:16.993
I'll tell you what, though,
no, one interesting thing.

35:17.028 --> 35:22.040
When this thing goes on sale next year in
Britain, it will make the job of the police
much easier.

35:22.075 --> 35:25.056
Let's pull these over and go, "Open
the boot... whose head's this?"

35:27.048 --> 35:31.076
But nevertheless, we must find out how
fast these cars go round our track,

35:31.111 --> 35:35.092
and that of course means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

35:35.127 --> 35:40.048
Some say that if you hold
him in the wrong way,

35:40.083 --> 35:42.012
he doesn't work properly.

35:44.036 --> 35:50.080
And that, just very recently, he developed
an irrational hatred of Rubens Barrichello.

35:53.020 --> 35:56.008
All we know is he's
called the Stig.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.029
And they're off,

35:58.064 --> 36:01.993
and what a racket, the E63
drowning out the Chevy.

36:02.028 --> 36:06.040
You can, of course, get the
fantastic AMG V8 in many Mercs,

36:06.075 --> 36:09.029
and, personally, I wouldn't
have it in this one.

36:09.064 --> 36:13.004
It's just too ugly - and, in
this, case slightly brown.

36:13.039 --> 36:14.965
Round the first corner...

36:15.000 --> 36:17.516
There we are, vuvuzelas
on all three channels now.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.997
Stig hopefully will get
bored in the next week.

36:20.032 --> 36:22.084
The Camaro does have a
certain distinctive presence,

36:22.119 --> 36:26.009
which is peace of mind
for the murder squad.

36:26.044 --> 36:30.084
Up to the Hammerhead, both
getting a little bit sideways,

36:30.119 --> 36:32.009
but only the Camaro fills the Stig

36:32.044 --> 36:35.092
with a sudden urge to
murder his postman.

36:35.127 --> 36:37.084
Actually, he did that in 2004.

36:40.028 --> 36:46.040
Follow-through and now, both...
Yep, going through there nicely.

36:46.075 --> 36:49.080
And yep, kicking up
dust through the tyres.

36:49.115 --> 36:52.067
Two corners remain,
let's have a look.

36:52.102 --> 36:54.985
Oh, the Camaro getting
it very crossed up.

36:55.020 --> 36:58.024
The Merc is running away
now, just Gambon left,

36:58.059 --> 37:01.028
and they are now through
that and across the line.

37:01.063 --> 37:03.092
Right, now... I've got the times.

37:03.127 --> 37:05.989
Yes.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.053
These are the times.

37:08.088 --> 37:14.993
So the Mercedes did it in
1:24.9, which puts it there.

37:15.028 --> 37:19.000
That's unbelievable, that's the
same as that Supersports Bentley.

37:19.035 --> 37:20.061
It is, yes, and the
Camaro did it in...

37:20.096 --> 37:27.037
1:27.9, which is just...
keep going down, it's down there.

37:27.072 --> 37:31.048
So it's even slower than the pick-up
truck of the car on which it's based?

37:31.083 --> 37:33.061
Yeah, yeah, it is that, yeah,
but I'd still have this.

37:33.096 --> 37:37.029
It was probably weighed down by
all the body parts in the boot.

37:37.064 --> 37:41.072
Anyway, it's now time to put another
star in our reasonably priced car,

37:41.107 --> 37:43.973
though of course this
time the brand-new one.

37:44.008 --> 37:46.534
Now, my guest tonight played
a character in Harry Potter

37:46.569 --> 37:49.060
who, in olden times, would
have been burned at the stake.

37:49.095 --> 37:52.096
Not for being a wizard
but because he's ginger.

37:52.131 --> 37:54.092
Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Grint!

37:54.127 --> 37:56.032
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:58.004 --> 38:00.008
How are you?Yeah, good.
Really good.

38:00.043 --> 38:01.064
Rupert!

38:04.000 --> 38:06.088
Have a seat! Brilliant!

38:11.064 --> 38:16.024
Now, first of all, forgive me,
why do gingers get so much stick?

38:17.048 --> 38:20.049
Says a man with pubic hair!

38:20.084 --> 38:22.053
Saying that, I didn't get
much abuse at school.

38:22.088 --> 38:26.032
People used to call me Luke,
actually... for Lucozade.

38:26.067 --> 38:28.969
Oh, Lucozade.
Quite a clever nickname.

38:29.004 --> 38:32.052
Is there anyone here who thinks they
might be ginger? What about you?

38:32.087 --> 38:35.016
I'm not natural!
What, you dyed it ginger?!

38:35.051 --> 38:37.041
LAUGHTER

38:37.076 --> 38:40.009
That's nice to hear, yeah!
That is the future right there.

38:40.044 --> 38:45.056
Obviously, we have to talk about Harry
Potter, and you're probably fed up to the
back teeth with it.

38:45.091 --> 38:51.000
Well, I don't know, it has been my whole
life, basically, it's been 11 years.

38:51.035 --> 38:53.013
I've had children who've
been growing up in that time,

38:53.048 --> 38:57.068
so I've spent a lot of my time reading
them Harry Potter bedtime stories.

38:57.103 --> 39:02.040
What on earth is it about?
I mean, really...

39:02.075 --> 39:04.977
Basically, we win in the end so...

39:05.012 --> 39:07.076
Michael Gambon came here.
Yeah. A bit older than you,

39:07.111 --> 39:10.021
and I did ask him, "Do
you understand it?"

39:10.056 --> 39:13.037
And of course he was Dumbledore,
and he said, "Well, sort of. "

39:13.072 --> 39:17.564
But does he give the impression of
knowing what he's doing on the set or...?

39:17.599 --> 39:22.021
The performance is ama... He does get
a bit confused sometimes, I think.

39:22.056 --> 39:28.048
One question I had from my children, if you
don't mind my asking, is do you fancy Emily
Watson in real life?

39:29.080 --> 39:34.056
Well... No, don't do that face.
That man just did that, "Mmm... "

39:34.091 --> 39:36.045
But do you actually
fancy her in real life?

39:36.080 --> 39:40.076
Well, it's weird, because I actually
had to kiss her in this last one,

39:40.111 --> 39:43.036
because our characters
kind of get together.

39:43.071 --> 39:44.096
Yeah, yeah.

39:46.072 --> 39:49.072
And it's like a brother-sister
kind of relationship we've got.

39:49.107 --> 39:54.020
So you weren't nursing a semi.
Oh, my God!

40:00.080 --> 40:04.004
I wasn't, I wasn't, no.

40:04.032 --> 40:08.013
So what does the future hold, now that
the big ten years of Potter is over?

40:08.048 --> 40:12.056
I don't know, it's weird to come out of
something that you've been a part of for...

40:12.091 --> 40:13.997
most of your life.

40:14.032 --> 40:17.018
But I've done other
films, kind of in between,

40:17.053 --> 40:19.969
and hopefully I can kind
of continue doing that.

40:20.004 --> 40:24.514
One of the things that I was thinking...
I've been reading up on you, before you
came on,

40:24.549 --> 40:29.024
is that you could work with cars,because th
ey do seem to bea strong love for you. Yeah.

40:29.059 --> 40:32.025
Because what you actually own is...

40:32.060 --> 40:37.056
let's think, a Range Rooney, an
ice-cream van and a hovercraft.

40:37.091 --> 40:39.033
Yeah.

40:39.068 --> 40:42.096
Let's start with the Range
Rover, shall we? The Wayne Rover.

40:42.131 --> 40:43.997
Yeah. What colour's that?

40:44.032 --> 40:46.072
It's... orange, it's bright orange.

40:46.107 --> 40:48.045
LAUGHTER

40:48.080 --> 40:53.008
Yeah. It's ginger, it's
basically a ginger car.

40:53.043 --> 40:55.021
So that works well or...?

40:55.056 --> 40:58.005
I didn't make that connection
when I was picking the colour.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.076
I just thought it looked really cool. It's got
black wheels, and it does look really cool.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.985
An orange Range Rover
in black wheels?

41:04.020 --> 41:07.042
Yeah! Oh, dear, we're fightinga
lost cause here with you.

41:07.077 --> 41:10.064
Bringing it back down to
earth again. Ice-cream van?

41:10.099 --> 41:12.549
Yep... I've had that for a while.

41:12.584 --> 41:14.965
It's something I've always wanted.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.044
As a child, it was kind
of a dream, really.

41:17.079 --> 41:19.088
It's a '74 Bedford.

41:19.123 --> 41:20.577
It's pink.

41:20.612 --> 41:21.997
LAUGHTER

41:22.032 --> 41:28.056
It's not the most practical car, because
it's got one seat and it's basically a
kitchen on wheels.

41:28.091 --> 41:31.021
You do get people queuing
up on the side of a road.

41:31.056 --> 41:36.092
And then they're mildly surprisedwhen they
see who's actually sittingin it, I should
imagine. Yeah.

41:36.127 --> 41:42.063
And then obviously I have to ask, the
hovercraft. Yeah. I am a huge fan of
hovercrafts,

41:42.098 --> 41:46.577
because they are the most funyou can have
with an engine,I'm convinced. Yeah,
definitely.

41:46.612 --> 41:51.056
I was told the first time I ever went on
one - and you must have experienced this -

41:51.091 --> 41:54.969
if you actually see an obstacle,if y
ou can see it,you will hit it. Yeah.

41:55.004 --> 42:02.024
At some point between seeing it, and then
it could be an hour or so, it doesn't
matter what you do...

42:02.059 --> 42:04.049
They're amazing, you've
got no control at all.

42:04.084 --> 42:08.028
Have you ever actually hit anything?
Oh, yeah! I've hit a few things.

42:08.063 --> 42:10.981
And so are you a good driver?

42:11.016 --> 42:14.044
Well, I like to think so. I used to do
a bit of karting when I was younger.

42:14.079 --> 42:17.016
Did you now?
So, competitive karting?

42:17.051 --> 42:18.061
Well, yeah, with my brother.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.576
So what did you think
of our new reasonably priced car?

42:21.611 --> 42:24.557
I quite liked it.
It was better than I thought.

42:24.592 --> 42:30.505
Yeah, because interestingly,
and I'm actually not joking,

42:30.540 --> 42:37.504
we've had this from Kia, the makers of a
reasonably priced car, to say that they're
recalling the Cee'd.

42:37.539 --> 42:39.537
No way!

42:39.572 --> 42:47.512
They've identified that Cee'd models could
suffer from insufficient brake force from
the master cylinder.

42:47.547 --> 42:51.580
So what they're actuallysaying there in
long wordsis the brakes don't work. No way!

42:51.615 --> 42:53.561
Did nobody tell you that?

42:53.596 --> 42:55.473
No, I didn't realise...

42:55.508 --> 42:58.560
Nobody from our production team
told that that car's been recalled?

42:58.595 --> 43:01.497
No, I didn't realise that.
It felt all right.

43:01.532 --> 43:06.556
No, apparently only 468 models have been
affected, and we don't know that it's ours
yet, it's possible.

43:06.591 --> 43:09.485
Anyway, you didn't die!
I didn't die.

43:09.520 --> 43:15.520
No, you made it, and who herewould
like to see Rupert's lap? Yes!

43:15.555 --> 43:17.553
Let's have a look.

43:17.588 --> 43:20.046
There we go. Look at it!

43:20.081 --> 43:22.504
A symphony in brown.

43:22.539 --> 43:25.477
Come on, mmm!

43:25.512 --> 43:27.521
Looking determined.

43:27.556 --> 43:33.556
Not lost there, no, well done, you
remembered to go left, that's important.

43:33.591 --> 43:35.575
That's looking very
neat and tidy. Yeah?

43:35.610 --> 43:37.560
Well, neat and tidy
is the key, really.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.477
Come on.

43:40.512 --> 43:44.540
No, it won't go any faster, that
really is as fast as it goes.

43:44.575 --> 43:46.557
You see, this is the important
thing - if you look slow,

43:46.592 --> 43:52.596
chances are you're going not as slowly as
you think. Oh, no, a bit of a wobble into
the Hammerhead.

43:52.631 --> 43:54.477
Do you stay in the lines?

43:54.512 --> 43:57.505
Yes, even more in the lines.
It does understeer, this, did you notice?

43:57.540 --> 44:01.540
It does, yeah, yeah, I was really shocked
by that. Oh, you see, you know...

44:01.575 --> 44:05.592
Fourth... Are you a
manthat prefers oversteer?

44:05.627 --> 44:08.549
I don't really
understand oversteer.

44:08.584 --> 44:12.544
Well, this car, when you turn the
steering wheel, it sort of pushes on.

44:12.579 --> 44:14.521
Yeah.

44:14.556 --> 44:16.549
Brake... now!

44:16.584 --> 44:21.560
Yes, that was a beautiful line
through that, absolutely perfect.

44:21.595 --> 44:23.469
That's understeer! Right.

44:23.504 --> 44:28.500
You almost turned right over, butthere
we are, look, across the line!
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

44:34.516 --> 44:38.465
Come on, youth, where do
you think you are on that?

44:38.500 --> 44:42.588
Obviously not the wet ones, but 1:45.9
is Peter Jones, the fastest man.

44:42.623 --> 44:45.588
I don't think I got
to the top but...

44:45.623 --> 44:47.485
Well, mmm...

44:47.520 --> 44:51.536
I shall just have a look on here and see if
I can see where you came, hang on a minute.

44:51.571 --> 44:53.548
Is this like being back at school?

44:53.583 --> 44:55.548
You got a B minus!

44:57.528 --> 45:03.592
So, Rupert Grint, you did it in... one
minute, you'll be relieved to hear... 40...

45:06.588 --> 45:09.090
5.5!

45:09.125 --> 45:11.557
Oh, yes!

45:11.592 --> 45:18.080
He's the fastest! He's the fastest!

45:18.115 --> 45:24.533
The second time!
The second time! Wow.

45:24.568 --> 45:29.512
It's just something in the airtoday.
Because Rubens has goneand bust that one.
Yes, I saw!

45:29.547 --> 45:31.513
And now you've bust that one.
Oh, that's good.

45:31.548 --> 45:36.584
We know that Peter Jones was quick
in the old car, the tall Dragon man,

45:36.619 --> 45:39.580
so we thought, "Well, that
time will take some beating. "

45:39.615 --> 45:42.537
He has, by the way,
just committed suicide.

45:42.572 --> 45:46.540
He honestly left the other day saying,
"Well, no-one will beat that in a hurry!"

45:46.575 --> 45:50.528
And it's actually taken precisely
two weeks for his time to be beaten.

45:50.563 --> 45:52.561
I don't think that's going to
get knocked off for a while.

45:52.596 --> 45:57.532
Wow, I'm impressed with that. So thank you
so much for coming,thank you for busting it.

45:57.567 --> 46:00.588
Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Grint.
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

46:08.500 --> 46:10.497
Right!

46:10.532 --> 46:16.544
Earlier on, we tested the new Aston Martin
Rapide, which we liked, despite the price,

46:16.579 --> 46:20.537
the Porsche Panamera, which we
liked, despite the hideous body,

46:20.572 --> 46:26.572
and the Maserati Quattroporte, which we
liked, despite... pretty much everything,
really.

46:26.607 --> 46:31.588
Now, though, it is time to see how
good these are as four-door saloons.

46:38.504 --> 46:44.532
To do that, the producers said we
must spend the day as chauffeurs.

46:44.567 --> 46:47.569
Guys? I know all
about chauffeuring.

46:47.604 --> 46:50.537
Go on. You've got to wear a hat,

46:50.572 --> 46:56.596
and you have to remember, when you open the
back door for a girl to get in, not to look
up her skirt.

46:56.631 --> 46:59.500
Right.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.545
On the way, we changed
into our suits, and then

47:02.580 --> 47:06.564
we arrived at a hotel to meet
the people we'd be chauffeuring.

47:08.516 --> 47:10.500
OK. Where's your suit trousers?

47:10.535 --> 47:12.521
I've lost them. Lost them?

47:12.556 --> 47:17.548
Honestly, I've searched the housetop to
bottom. So we'll have, what do you reckon,
one person each or...?

47:17.583 --> 47:19.485
I think it's probably a conference.

47:19.520 --> 47:23.554
We'll go to different places and
it'll be who get to his place first.

47:23.589 --> 47:27.588
Chauffeur race. Exactly, different
places, it's who gets there first.

47:27.623 --> 47:29.087
What? It's a wedding.

47:29.122 --> 47:30.517
What's a wedding?

47:30.552 --> 47:33.596
It's a wedding, we're doing a wedding,
we're the car service for a wedding.

47:33.631 --> 47:36.591
Mate, you can't do
a wedding in jeans.

47:36.626 --> 47:39.552
You can't, actually,
that's going too far.

47:39.587 --> 47:41.481
I can mend this.

47:41.516 --> 47:43.545
A real wedding? Yes.
What, an actual wedding?

47:43.580 --> 47:46.541
Yes. We have to drive to
the church, the reception.

47:46.576 --> 47:51.524
We are the drivers for the day to see
how big the backs of these cars are.

47:51.559 --> 47:53.465
And I've got to mend my trousers.

47:53.500 --> 47:57.508
Who is there at a wedding? A bride,
a groom... Bride, groom, vicar...

47:57.543 --> 47:59.572
Bride's mother, parents,
they all have to go.

47:59.607 --> 48:01.513
The Maserati's the biggest.

48:01.548 --> 48:03.501
The bride should
go in the Maserati.

48:03.536 --> 48:07.521
The bride's the mostimportant person at
a wedding. So put the bride in the...

48:07.556 --> 48:11.592
Put the bride in the Maserati. I should
drive her, because I haven't driven the
Maserati.

48:11.627 --> 48:15.528
You're welcome, I'm not driving
a bride to her wedding, no way!

48:15.563 --> 48:17.567
Listen, everything we
ever do is a disaster.

48:17.602 --> 48:19.537
Well, including what
you're doing there.

48:19.572 --> 48:25.572
They'll be black in a minute,trust me. So
bride in the Maserati. Yeah. You drive
that. Yeah.

48:25.607 --> 48:29.532
Groom is going to want
to go in the Aston.

48:29.567 --> 48:30.549
I'll take him in the Aston.

48:30.584 --> 48:33.540
I'll do the bride's
mother in the Porsche.

48:33.575 --> 48:36.521
I wouldn't... Oh, I see!

48:36.556 --> 48:41.500
She'll be emotional, and I'm just what
she needs on her daughter's wedding day.

48:41.535 --> 48:44.465
Hammond set off to get the groom,

48:44.500 --> 48:47.596
leaving me in a spot of
bother with my new trousers.

48:47.631 --> 48:49.557
Oh, no.

48:49.592 --> 48:51.572
My legs have stuck together.

48:55.524 --> 48:56.541
I do apologise for this.

48:56.576 --> 49:01.058
Worse still, chauffeur duties had made
James even more pedantic than usual.

49:01.093 --> 49:04.838
Because I want my Maserati here for
the bride, I think it's more grand.

49:04.873 --> 49:08.728
Yes, you go and get your Maserati.
Can you move out of the way, then?Yep.

49:08.763 --> 49:12.549
But hang on, I can't do this until
you've gone, otherwise it's in the way.

49:12.584 --> 49:17.568
What? I can't put the Maserati there before
you've gone, or they'd have to walk round
it. That's not right.

49:17.603 --> 49:19.513
What are you talking about?

49:19.548 --> 49:23.564
I can't put the Maserati in position until
you've left with the bride's mother. Why?

49:23.599 --> 49:25.557
Otherwise she'll come out
and get in the Maserati...

49:25.592 --> 49:28.580
She won't, because we'll say,
"Don't get in the Maserati. "

49:28.615 --> 49:31.568
Then she has to walk around it,
and it's not right, trust me.

49:31.603 --> 49:34.588
Meanwhile, I'd arrived
at the groom's house.

49:34.623 --> 49:37.497
This is it.

49:37.532 --> 49:41.596
But having never chauffeured before, I
didn't know whether to get him or wait in
the car.

49:41.631 --> 49:43.572
He wants to get
ready, take his time.

49:43.607 --> 49:45.095
I'll, erm...

49:45.130 --> 49:46.584
I'll hover here.

49:51.548 --> 49:54.521
You've got half an hour to get
there, you've got to be...

49:54.556 --> 49:58.528
I've got to be late, yes. Yes, but a
tiny bit late, not your usual late.

49:58.563 --> 50:00.493
No, no, I understand
the difference.

50:00.528 --> 50:07.500
Whilst James was still deciding where to
put his car, the wedding party emerged.

50:07.535 --> 50:09.541
I was going to back it
up and do it properly.

50:09.576 --> 50:13.588
Do you want to go in and come out while I
back it up? James,will you concentrate on
your job?

50:13.623 --> 50:17.564
This way, please. Don't look up her
skirt, don't look up her skirt.

50:21.504 --> 50:26.584
No, no, no! I'm in!
Thank you for averting your gaze.

50:26.619 --> 50:31.477
Come on. Where is he?

50:31.512 --> 50:32.588
Oh, you're already in! Sorry!

50:32.623 --> 50:33.592
He's already in.

50:35.508 --> 50:36.540
Good afternoon, everyone.

50:36.575 --> 50:38.473
Oh, good afternoon.

50:38.508 --> 50:40.485
I'm James, I shall be your driver.

50:40.520 --> 50:44.568
This is the Maserati Quattroporte. Not the
original model, which had a slightly ropey
gearbox.

50:44.603 --> 50:48.512
This is the GTS, much
improved, as you shall see.

50:48.547 --> 50:50.516
The key's stuck.

50:52.524 --> 50:56.485
Jeremy, meanwhile, was being
his usual charming self.

50:56.520 --> 51:01.524
If I've got whiffy pits, I apologise, but
it is from wearing slightly hot trousers.

51:10.592 --> 51:16.524
Come on, we're late, we're late!That's the
groom, that's the groom. He is the groom.

51:16.559 --> 51:19.580
You're Steve? Yeah. Hi, Steve.
Sorry, mate, sorry.

51:19.615 --> 51:21.575
And you're Sam, the best man?

51:21.610 --> 51:23.536
Hiya. Hi, nice to see you.

51:27.528 --> 51:29.521
Are we not going right to
the church? Yeah, you...

51:29.556 --> 51:32.552
As we are a bit early, and obviously
you don't want to arrive early,

51:32.587 --> 51:35.553
I thought we'd take a slightly
longer route, slightly scenic,

51:35.588 --> 51:41.528
so that you can arrive at an appropriate
time and also enjoy the car a little bit on
the journey.

51:41.563 --> 51:45.536
Unfortunately, the bride's
father had never seen Top Gear.

51:45.571 --> 51:48.473
That sounds really good, yeah.

51:48.508 --> 51:53.500
Still, at least James
was driving sensibly.

51:53.535 --> 51:54.568
Sport, sport plus.

51:56.548 --> 51:59.509
I WILL get you to
the church on time.

51:59.544 --> 52:03.552
As it turned out, my
passengers loved fast driving.

52:03.587 --> 52:04.580
Wow!

52:07.528 --> 52:09.529
So a marriage, whoo!

52:09.564 --> 52:11.578
It's a big 'un. It's the big day.

52:11.613 --> 52:13.592
Think what you're taking on, man.

52:13.627 --> 52:16.520
Life changes today. Today.

52:16.555 --> 52:17.549
Yeah. For real.

52:17.584 --> 52:19.501
It's amazing, isn't it, marriage?

52:19.536 --> 52:23.520
You have the big day, the big
celebration, it's all exciting,

52:23.555 --> 52:27.508
and then one day it just
settles down into the norm,

52:27.543 --> 52:29.517
day to day,

52:29.552 --> 52:34.568
just every day...
after day... after day...

52:38.524 --> 52:42.516
You'll never get it to sound like this.
It's to do with the crank angle and
cylinders.

52:42.551 --> 52:46.557
I never thought I'd be learning about
crank angles on the way to my wedding.

52:46.592 --> 52:50.564
Sorry, I think I've taken the wrong exit
off that roundabout. Hang on a minute.

52:50.599 --> 52:54.493
I guess we're going to check
out the road holding or...

52:54.528 --> 52:58.560
No, no, this isn't a test, I'm just... Because
I've done this loop, I'm not absolutely sure...

52:58.595 --> 53:01.548
It must be the next one.

53:04.584 --> 53:07.556
You're not getting nervous
now, are you? I am now.

53:07.591 --> 53:09.528
I was feeling pretty relaxed but...

53:09.563 --> 53:11.553
I'll help you with some music.

53:11.588 --> 53:14.572
There you go... Oh, look,
it's not as easy as I'd hoped.

53:18.512 --> 53:20.537
We really have to get a move on.

53:20.572 --> 53:25.481
Yeah, but I just want to find out,
can I drive the iPod from the stereo?

53:25.516 --> 53:30.504
Oh, this is the most complicated thing I've
ever tried to do. Oh, no, that's just
impossible.

53:30.539 --> 53:31.564
Hang on, I think I've got it.

53:32.564 --> 53:36.042
# I'm not in love

53:36.077 --> 53:39.485
# So don't forget it

53:39.520 --> 53:41.556
# It's just a silly phase... #

53:41.591 --> 53:44.576
Here we go! Power!

53:47.500 --> 53:50.544
In the back, Jenson and Lewis
wanted even more from the Porsche.

53:50.579 --> 53:52.561
Can't we go somewhere we
can go really fast? Yeah.

53:52.596 --> 53:56.594
I have to say... Up to the airfield?
Oh, is there an airfield near here?

53:56.629 --> 54:00.592
Yeah! Pull in there, do a circuit,
and then we don't mind being late.

54:00.627 --> 54:02.609
Is she a calm bride?

54:02.644 --> 54:04.557
She's been SO calm.

54:04.592 --> 54:11.512
Because James May can drive somebody to
the edge of reason after three minutes.

54:12.524 --> 54:16.544
I'll turn round in the garden centre.
Sorry about that.

54:21.556 --> 54:24.513
As the clock struck one, I
pulled up at the church.

54:24.548 --> 54:29.584
I almost lost my dress then!
We made it, we made it, we made it.

54:33.576 --> 54:38.532
The bride's mother and chief bridesmaid
seemed very happy with my chauffeuring
skills.

54:38.567 --> 54:40.549
However, in Claire Rayner's car...

54:40.584 --> 54:44.080
# Whoo-hoo, no, baby,
please don't go... #

54:44.115 --> 54:47.576
I mean it's like your
life, it's for life!

54:47.611 --> 54:49.541
It is for life.

54:49.576 --> 54:53.564
Just stretching out
in front of you.

54:53.599 --> 54:55.561
Forever.

54:55.596 --> 54:57.548
Just going on... and on.

55:01.560 --> 55:05.572
Amazingly, though, when Captain
Cheerful eventually arrived,

55:05.607 --> 55:08.549
the groom was more
bothered about my trousers.

55:08.584 --> 55:13.497
What are you wearing?
! I'm fine, nothing to see here.

55:13.532 --> 55:18.536
More worryingly, there was nothing
to see in terms of the bride either.

55:18.571 --> 55:22.481
The relations are
starting to get angsty.

55:22.516 --> 55:26.576
I can just feel eyes burrowing
into the back of my head.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.504
I did look at the map
before I started off.

55:42.536 --> 55:43.588
Right, nearly there.

55:49.564 --> 55:54.548
What hymns have you chosen?
The King Of Love My Shepherd Is.

55:54.583 --> 55:57.513
Very good.

55:57.548 --> 56:00.556
JAMES SINGS THE TUNE

56:02.540 --> 56:03.584
CHURCH BELLS RING

56:05.568 --> 56:09.540
Half one, half an hour
late now for the wedding.

56:10.568 --> 56:13.050
Look, there it is. Hmm?

56:13.085 --> 56:15.497
The church was that way.

56:15.532 --> 56:18.552
Are you sure it was that way?
Yes. Yeah.

56:18.587 --> 56:21.504
Completely, 100% sure.

56:22.556 --> 56:26.501
We're now into something to two o'clock.
We're now nearer two o'clock...

56:26.536 --> 56:30.509
We're nearer the next hour than the one
when they were supposed to be getting
married.

56:30.544 --> 56:36.548
This would have been your last car journey
before you became a married woman, I hope
it was a good one.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.557
That man, he is the
most colossal...

56:47.592 --> 56:50.548
Where have you been?
We took a slightly scenic route.

56:50.583 --> 56:54.493
The wedding party
hurried into the church.

56:54.528 --> 57:01.520
Explain yourself. What? How come you've
arrived 35 minutes late? It's fashionable
for the bride...

57:01.555 --> 57:04.529
Yeah, you've obviously made an
impression, because they're all leaving.

57:04.564 --> 57:10.524
They're really happy to have had you
driving, look at their cheery faces as they
walk off dabbing their eyes.

57:10.559 --> 57:11.553
Did they like the Maserati?

57:11.588 --> 57:15.520
Loved it! Did they? Yeah, absolutely.
Did you love it?

57:15.555 --> 57:17.572
I love it, top five cars.
What do we do now?

57:17.607 --> 57:19.513
Now we wait for them.
That's boring.

57:19.548 --> 57:24.552
Actually, no, I tell you what. The bride's
mother told me on the way over there's an
airfield near here.

57:24.587 --> 57:28.069
So? Well, is this a
Catholic wedding or...?

57:28.104 --> 57:31.552
They'll be doing Dear
Lord and Father of...

57:31.587 --> 57:34.540
Drag race. Bagsie go in this.

57:34.575 --> 57:36.556
Drag race. Drag race.

57:38.508 --> 57:41.548
So as the congregation
began its first hymn...

57:41.583 --> 57:43.561
ENGINES ROAR

57:43.596 --> 57:50.556
.. we headed off to the airfield
and set up our drag race.

57:51.564 --> 57:55.508
I'm sure most wedding
car drivers do this.

57:56.512 --> 57:58.556
I wonder if they've done
the exhortations yet.

58:02.536 --> 58:04.500
Go!

58:08.548 --> 58:10.532
Yes!

58:12.532 --> 58:15.497
Look at this go!

58:15.532 --> 58:18.552
80, level-pegging with the Ast...
Oh, no, I'm not.

58:19.564 --> 58:23.560
Maserati sitting in my door
mirror here like an oil painting.

58:23.595 --> 58:26.516
Come on, come on!

58:30.544 --> 58:36.493
Even with James at the wheel,
that Porsche easily won.

58:36.528 --> 58:40.560
Since the race was over so quickly, I
decided there was time for another game.

58:40.595 --> 58:46.576
I bet I can do a longer powerslide
in that than you two can in these.

58:46.611 --> 58:47.557
Good game?

58:47.592 --> 58:50.588
Come on, it's a beautiful day,
we've got crash helmets on.

58:57.580 --> 59:01.508
The back's coming out nicely,
and now bin it there!

59:04.508 --> 59:05.561
Too much grip.

59:05.596 --> 59:08.556
Our new game was excellent fun!

59:08.591 --> 59:11.528
BELLS RING

59:12.568 --> 59:15.525
TYRES SQUEAL

59:15.560 --> 59:18.540
That's a good one!
What do you think of that, Hammond?

59:20.528 --> 59:24.548
And another championship-winning entry
from Hammond in the Maserati. Yeah.

59:31.508 --> 59:34.528
Oh, yeah! Feeling
sick but looking good!

59:35.584 --> 59:37.536
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

59:44.536 --> 59:49.556
I know... I know a lot of you will have
been looking at that and thinking it was
all a set-up,

59:49.591 --> 59:50.557
they were actors.

59:50.592 --> 59:54.537
Well, it really wasn't,
they really were a couple,

59:54.572 --> 59:58.568
they really did get married that
day, and they really are here.

59:58.603 --> 01:00:00.552
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve and Ellie!

01:00:00.587 --> 01:00:01.521
APPLAUSE

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:05.521
Congratulations!
Sorry! Really sorry.

01:00:05.556 --> 01:00:10.485
Sorry we weren't there
when you came out.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.540
Sorry about my mood on the day, it was
inappropriate, as it turned out. We're
sorry.

01:00:14.575 --> 01:00:19.551
By way of an apology and as a token
of our appreciation, we've brought

01:00:19.586 --> 01:00:24.528
you this memento so you can remember
the day every time you have a dump.

01:00:24.563 --> 01:00:25.596
LAUGHTER Congratulations!

01:00:27.596 --> 01:00:31.580
Congratulations. Thank you.

01:00:31.615 --> 01:00:34.477
Excellent, excellent.

01:00:34.512 --> 01:00:38.528
We clubbed together to buy that,just so you
know. Ourselves. Your eternal happiness.

01:00:38.563 --> 01:00:42.536
Anyway, it is now time for us to
decide which of these cars is best.

01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:46.501
Quite easy for me, the
Maserati is idiotic, OK?

01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:50.560
After five minutes it would drive you mad,
and after five weeks it would fall to
pieces.

01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:53.568
But for me, by a country mile,
it's the one I'd have. Me too.

01:00:53.603 --> 01:00:56.529
Yeah, and me, by a long, long way.

01:00:56.564 --> 01:00:58.588
Yeah, so there we are, we
all agree on something.

01:00:58.623 --> 01:01:01.469
The worst car is the best.

01:01:01.504 --> 01:01:04.525
And on both those bombshell,
it's now time to end.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.592
Thank you for watching. Not that you were,
because you were watching the football, but
there we are.

01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:11.596
See you next week, though.
Take care, good night!

01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:13.548
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
