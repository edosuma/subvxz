<i> When Calls the Heart.</i>

00:02.737 --> 00:03.502
I want you to be-

00:03.537 --> 00:04.603
We want you to be
our bridesmaid!

00:04.638 --> 00:06.205
Of course I will.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.273
You have quite the way
with words.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.875
Ms. Carter I have good news.

00:09.910 --> 00:12.745
They've agreed to enrol
you in the upcoming semester.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.546
I'm going to Chicago
in a week.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.814
You've had an impressive career.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.616
I try not to dwell on the past.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.451
You're a partner
in his oil business.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.586
That's right.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.121
Did it give you pause to go
into business with a man

00:22.156 --> 00:23.122
convicted of stealing?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.123
Huh!

00:24.158 --> 00:24.957
Let me handle the food then?

00:24.992 --> 00:26.258
You are going to be
far too busy.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.393
Well, how is that?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.528
Because you're going to be
walking me down the aisle.

00:33.934 --> 00:36.135
Good morning.
Good morning.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.772
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.973
What are you doing here?

00:41.008 --> 00:42.241
It's such a beautiful day

00:42.276 --> 00:44.943
I thought I would take a walk
and return your latest chapters.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.512
Good morning, Mrs. Thornton.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.447
Good morning, Anna.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.681
Thank you for bringing these.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.116
My pleasure.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.352
Now, I'm very excited about-

00:53.387 --> 00:54.253
Good morning.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.654
Good morning, Emily.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.489
-Sorry, um-
-That's ok.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.424
You were saying.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.426
I am excited about
the dynamics between-

01:00.461 --> 01:01.160
Good morning, Robert.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.661
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.629
Good morning.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.097
Good morning, Allie.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.332
Hello.

01:08.736 --> 01:09.601
Hello.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.004
Uh... uh...

01:13.507 --> 01:15.607
I should probably
start school.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.642
Right.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.148
Bye.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.461
[sighs]

01:37.998 --> 01:39.164
Ah, perfect.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.566
You're in a good mood.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.868
Well, I like when things go
according to plan.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.069
Oh, what plan?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.070
My plan.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.972
I read a short legal brief,
I make the eggs.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.340
I read a long brief,

01:48.375 --> 01:49.741
I make the dinner special.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.845
The law is way too dry
to do it non-stop.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.846
-What?
-Oh.

01:53.881 --> 01:54.813
Oh, by the way,

01:54.849 --> 01:56.315
I have a pre-trial conference
later today.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.217
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

01:58.252 --> 02:00.486
It means that I need you
to cover for me.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.887
Oh, so what you are
really saying

02:01.922 --> 02:03.922
is your plan only works
when I help.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.757
But now you have help too.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.527
Still, it's a good thing I quit
my job at the saloon.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.762
Thank you for that, Clara.

02:10.798 --> 02:15.234
Now, if only those plates
would deliver themselves.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.369
[laughs]

02:18.939 --> 02:22.374
I was very pleased
with your book reports.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
Excellent work every one.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.181
Robert, your paper on
Freud's dream analysis

02:29.216 --> 02:31.083
was pretty ambitious.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.418
Do you remember your dreams,
Mrs. Thornton?

02:33.454 --> 02:35.020
Only the strange ones.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.222
Well, I can try and interpret
them for you.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.258
Thank you. That's very
nice of you.

02:40.561 --> 02:44.563
Allie, did you enjoy learning
all about Queen Victoria?

02:44.598 --> 02:47.733
I did. But it was sad
when Prince Albert died.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.401
They really loved each other.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.037
Yes, they did.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.305
Nice work Emily.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.041
You know, Paul Cezanne is one
of my favourite artist as well.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.142
Thank you.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.278
You're welcome.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.647
Opal, are you alright?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.282
My arms itch.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.450
Well, I can see that.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.921
Here, let me have a look.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.295
Oh, that ain't good.

03:51.498 --> 03:55.634
You were right,
chicken pox.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.002
How dangerous is it?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.338
Not dangerous at all
for kids her age.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.540
Highly annoying
and highly contagious.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.776
There is a good chance every kid
will catch it.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.181
Class, may I have
your attention please.

04:09.216 --> 04:13.051
How many of you have had
chicken pox?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.857
Oh, my.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.026
I am going to need all of you
to go straight home

04:21.061 --> 04:24.496
and tell your parents
that you have been exposed.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.131
Yes, Allie.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.866
Can I catch it again?

04:27.901 --> 04:31.136
No. Once you've had it,
you are immune.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.738
What happens with chicken pox?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.040
We all get to stay home
is what happens.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.875
I will be stopping by
all of your homes later

04:36.910 --> 04:38.110
to check on you.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.012
And I will be bringing by all
of your homework assignments

04:40.047 --> 04:41.813
for the next few days.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.982
But I was going to go fishing.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.851
I'm sure it will take at least
an hour for me

04:45.886 --> 04:47.719
to organize all of the homework
assignments

04:47.755 --> 04:49.721
and then another few hours
to deliver them.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.858
I'm sure you'll have plenty
of time to catch your fish.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.226
Thanks Mrs. Thornton.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.894
You are welcome.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.196
Class dismissed.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.798
[bell rings]

05:01.302 --> 05:03.268
Should I be worried
about Little Jack?

05:03.304 --> 05:04.536
Have you had chicken pox?

05:04.571 --> 05:05.937
When I was seven.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.573
Ah, he's perfectly safe
with you.

05:08.609 --> 05:13.178
I would prefer it if Jack waited
a few years before he caught it.

05:13.213 --> 05:17.683
Keep him away from anybody
who may be contagious.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.552
Opal. I will be by later
to check on you.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.020
Thanks Mrs. Thornton.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.756
Ready to go?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.658
Let's go.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.395
[sighs]

05:30.431 --> 05:31.863
All right, who wants to start?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.265
He cheated me.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.534
The crude was top quality.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.203
Mr. Murphy why don't you tell
me what this law suit is about.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.105
I paid for high-quality crude.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.040
Henry's oil is sub-standard.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.542
That is an untruth.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.143
I thought oil is oil.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.480
No. High-quality crude
is sweet.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.883
Low quality, like Henry's,
is sour.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.286
Sweet and sour?
How is that?

05:54.321 --> 05:55.754
It's all about the sulphur
content.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.823
The more sulphur,
the more sour.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.991
And I paid top dollar
for the higher grade.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.727
And you received
the higher grade.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.595
Well, my test show
it is not.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.663
Excuse me.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.664
What?

06:05.699 --> 06:06.932
I am just a silent partner here.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.601
Is there any way I can have my
name removed from this law suit?

06:09.636 --> 06:11.770
It doesn't work that way,
you're in.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.106
I'd like to see all of you work
this out amongst yourselves

06:14.141 --> 06:16.575
but I can see that's
not an option.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.844
Trial starts 9:00 am tomorrow.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.479
I am going to need more time
than that.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.380
You've had time, Henry.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.115
This has been on the books
for a while.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.418
I mean, if word gets out that
my crude is low quality,

06:26.453 --> 06:27.586
well, it's going to ruin me.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.787
You mean us.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.888
Us.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.491
Do you have proof that shows
that your oil is sweet?

06:32.526 --> 06:35.193
Yes, and my clients will say so.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.162
Well, then present it all
as evidence.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.664
9:00AM tomorrow.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.433
We want a jury.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.174
Well played.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.208
Doesn't buy you much.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.710
We'll find a jury by tomorrow.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.945
The trial starts 9:00AM
the next morning.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.347
Alright.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.281
Good work.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.315
Yeah.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.721
It should only take me
a couple of hours

07:02.756 --> 07:04.656
to deliver the homework.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.192
It's fine Mrs. Thornton,
you don't need to rush.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.027
And just to be safe,
be sure to check

07:09.062 --> 07:10.328
with anyone who comes
to the door

07:10.364 --> 07:12.297
that they've had
chicken pox.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.332
I don't want to take any chances
with Little Jack.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.667
I understand.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.402
I'm just glad I had them
when I was young.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.171
Me too.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.239
We are going to have
some time together.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.508
We're going to play
with your blocks and read.

07:23.544 --> 07:27.012
We are going to have
so much fun.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.713
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.653
Oh, what's wrong?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.154
Have you had chicken pox?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.223
Never. I was one of
the lucky ones.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.925
I'm not sure how lucky
that makes you.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.093
We've had an outbreak
at school.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.429
Oh, no.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.398
I'm afraid Little Jack
is off limits now.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.166
Doctor's orders.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.435
No, of course, I understand.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.503
Bye.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.213
We already have a couple of
patients in the infirmary

08:01.248 --> 08:04.850
with symptoms so the odds are
the town has been exposed.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.917
Oh.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.286
Good news is the contagion
period is only two days.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.955
So you both have had it,
right?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.723
Oh, yes.
Ages ago.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.958
Me too.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.860
Okay. I would appreciate it if
you would tell everyone in town

08:14.895 --> 08:15.861
just to be safe.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.795
Of course.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.729
Absolutely.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.597
Thank you.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.198
Carson, there you are!

08:20.234 --> 08:22.133
What's the matter?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.369
I can't stop itching.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.538

08:28.909 --> 08:32.744
<i> (Rosemary) I just can't stop</i>
<i> itching.  It's terrible.</i>

08:41.455 --> 08:42.120
Chicken pox?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.556
You've never had
them before?

08:44.591 --> 08:46.558
I was one of the lucky ones.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.461
Rosemary, chicken pox for adults
can be very dangerous.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.062
So this has to be
taken seriously.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.631
Are you certain?

08:52.666 --> 08:55.133
I'm afraid so.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.237
You have to go home and stay
in bed for a few days.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.239
A few days?!

09:01.275 --> 09:02.307
[exhales]

09:02.342 --> 09:06.444
I'll have Faith stop by
with some calamine lotion.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.079
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.681
I have chicken pox.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.749
Oh, no!

09:12.319 --> 09:13.518
Did I hear Rosemary right?

09:13.554 --> 09:14.819
You did?

09:14.855 --> 09:15.887
Anyone else?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.789
Opal and a few others
at the infirmary for now,

09:17.824 --> 09:20.992
but we are doing our best
to contain it.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.361
While I have you all her, I need
to pull a jury together,

09:23.397 --> 09:25.630
so if you could come by
my office tomorrow morning,

09:25.666 --> 09:26.598
I'd appreciate that.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.666
Sorry, Bill.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.934
I am going to be a little busy.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.468
That's understood.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.537
What would this jury involve?

09:32.573 --> 09:36.942
Listening, deliberating and
coming to a unanimous decision.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.643
I can definitely deliberate.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.679
And I'm a great listener.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.214
Count us in, Judge.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.383
Well, you can't just volunteer.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.152
It doesn't work that way.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.887
Why not?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.655
Just come by my office tomorrow.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.490
I'll go over it all then.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.463
This could be very exciting.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.098
Indeed.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.234
Nathan.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.202
Elizabeth.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.204
Oh, Allie told me about Opal.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.806
I'm a little concerned
about Mrs. McCormick

10:07.841 --> 10:09.474
and some of the other
elderly out of town.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.475
Thank you.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.177
I think they should be alerted,
just in case.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.144
You're right.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.245
I'll get it on it right away.

10:14.281 --> 10:14.946
Thank you.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.815
That's a lot of land to cover.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.216
It will take you all day.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.251
I'd be more than happy
to cover half.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.654
That's very kind of you, Lucas.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.492
Yeah. Meet me in front of
the jail in 15 minutes.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.160
Great.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.563
Elizabeth.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.531
How's Little Jack doing?

10:33.567 --> 10:35.734
He's healthy.
Thank you for asking.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.003
Any plans for your
time off school?

10:38.038 --> 10:40.105
Just spending the whole time
with my son,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.540
reading and playing
and cuddling.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.542
A lot of cuddling.

10:44.578 --> 10:49.047
That sounds wonderful
for both of you.

10:49.082 --> 10:53.251
Well, there is nothing quite
like unconditional love.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.921
You deserve nothing less.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.823
I should get ready.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.727
"It was the wind said
Martha stubbornly.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.196
"And if it wasn't, it was
little Betty Butterworth

11:05.232 --> 11:06.431
"the scullery maid.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.034
"She had the toothache all day.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.436
"But something troubled
and awkward in her manner

11:11.471 --> 11:13.705
"made Mistress Mary stare
very hard at her.

11:13.740 --> 11:18.677
"She did not believe she was
speaking the truth."

11:20.447 --> 11:22.480
Can't you stay
and read Chapter 6?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.716
There's nothing I'd like more
but I still have

11:24.751 --> 11:26.951
several students who need
their homework.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.620
Why don't you read
Chapters 6 through 11

11:28.655 --> 11:30.455
and we can discuss them
on Monday.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.791
Can't you come back tomorrow
and read them to me?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.060
Opal, if I read you
your whole assignment

11:35.095 --> 11:37.495
how will you ever learn?

11:37.531 --> 11:41.566
By reading Chapters 12
through 16?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.368
[laughs]

11:46.807 --> 11:47.939
You're late.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.441
You said 15.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.110
Twenty minutes ago.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.445
Are you always such a stickler?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.281
I am when it's my time
you're wasting.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.749
My apologies.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.987
Listen, Lucas, we both know
why you volunteered for this.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.091
You're not the only one
who cares about this town.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.292
The town?

12:07.327 --> 12:09.461
Yeah.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.830
Well, the town's not here right
now so if you'd like to bow out,

12:11.865 --> 12:13.431
now is your chance.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.167
I'm a man of my word.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.235
Okay.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.904
You take that road.
I'm going to take this one.

12:22.042 --> 12:29.547
Lucas, despite our mutual
feelings for the town,

12:29.583 --> 12:32.417
I appreciate the help.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.455
Great. I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.356
Clara!

12:38.391 --> 12:40.391
Clara, what do you know
about jury duty?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.393
That you sit in court
and listen to evidence.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.462
Great. Can you be at my office
at 9:00AM tomorrow morning?

12:44.498 --> 12:45.563
Mmmhmm.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.464
What about me?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.800
Jesse you sued Gowen
not 12 months ago,

12:48.835 --> 12:50.301
do you really think you can
be impartial?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.003
Well, if Clara can be so can I.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.304
9:00AM tomorrow.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.406
Oh, sorry I can't.
I'm covering for Lee.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.375
He's at home with Rosemary,
maybe the next day?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.676
Sorry, Jesse.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.345
Mrs. Wolfe! Mrs. Wolfe!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.914
Can you be at my office tomorrow
morning for jury selection?

13:02.949 --> 13:03.882
I'm afraid I can't.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.885
I will be taking care
of Robert and Sarah.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.719
Ned!

13:07.754 --> 13:10.255
Ned, no running from the law,
Ned.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.556
9:00AM tomorrow morning.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.524
My office.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.658
Jury duty.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.726
Oh, I'm so sorry, Judge,

13:14.761 --> 13:16.394
tomorrow is the day
I play bridge.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.529
Cancel it.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.364
But my partner is counting
on me.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
Well, I am counting on you.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.433
This is your civic duty, Ned.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.235
Folks, excuse me.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.406
Lee!

13:28.441 --> 13:30.575
[groans]

13:30.610 --> 13:31.743
Yes, sweetheart.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.545
Is there any sight of Faith?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.613
I really need that
calamine lotion.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.382
She should be here
any minute.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.383
I am in agony.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.450
I know. I know.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.853
Try and think of something else.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.087
I have an idea.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.089
Uh... here we go.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.257
Oh, that is a good idea.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.259
No, no, no, no, no.

13:48.295 --> 13:52.730
Not for scratching,
for reading.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.602
Really?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.417
[knocks]

14:12.452 --> 14:13.985
Constable.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.927
Constable, could I trouble you
for a moment?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.195
I could use your help.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.599
It doesn't have anything to do
with you being sued, does it?

14:27.634 --> 14:28.800
It does.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.569
Mounties don't usually involve
themselves in civil cases.

14:31.605 --> 14:34.439
Perhaps you might make
an exception.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.707
I know you don't owe
me anything.

14:35.742 --> 14:40.078
But I surely would
appreciate it.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.381
Alright.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.786
Let's see here.

14:50.824 --> 14:53.124
Well, that looks like a rash.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.761
Have you recently changed
your laundry detergent?

14:56.796 --> 14:59.664
Bertha lent me some that
she picked up in Benson Hills.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.133
Probably go back to
your original brand.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.469
So, I'm okay?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.471
Yes. Keep an eye on Sarah,
though.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.406
She's old enough that if
she caught it she'd be fine

15:08.441 --> 15:10.675
but if anything happens,
just bring her by.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.176
Okay. Thank you,
Dr. Shepherd.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.978
Okay. Bye, bye.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.316
I'll drop off calamine
to Rosemary.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.485
Can you check on the Anderson
baby while you're up there.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.753
Of course.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.954
Great.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.188
You all packed?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.256
[laughs]

15:25.292 --> 15:26.457
Not even close.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.293
Why don't you go home
straight after.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.527
I can handle it from here.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.662
Are you sure?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.163
Yes, go pack.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.832
You have a stagecoach
to catch tomorrow.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.303
[laughs]

15:42.909 --> 15:43.942
Nathan!

15:45.045 --> 15:49.013
Elizabeth... I have alerted
everyone in the area.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.816
Thank you. I really
appreciate that.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.052
Well, it's part of my job.

15:54.087 --> 15:58.323
I was looking for Allie.
Have you seen her anywhere?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.191
Did you check the fishing hole?

16:00.226 --> 16:02.327
First place I looked.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.463
I told her to be back at 3:30.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.231
Is there anything
I could do for you?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.733
I just have her homework.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.134
Oh, you can leave that
on my desk.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.135
I'll make sure she gets it.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.170
Great.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.139
So, uh, where are you going?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.975
I'm just taking him up
to the livery.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.010
I'm heading to Buxton
tomorrow.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.578
Oh? What's in Buxton?

16:20.613 --> 16:24.082
I'm checking out this whole
oil mess for Gowen.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.150
Are you?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.753
I am so glad you're
helping him.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.355
Really?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.689
I've just heard stories

16:31.725 --> 16:34.025
that he's not always
on the up and up.

16:34.060 --> 16:39.397
Maybe the old Henry
but people do change, Nathan.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.065
Yes, so you keep saying.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.205
[sighs]

16:48.775 --> 16:52.577
Lee, I am perfectly fine
and I am tired of being in bed.

16:52.612 --> 16:53.811
You heard what Carson said.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.447
Yes, I heard what Carson said
but I also know how I feel.

16:56.483 --> 17:00.218
And I have a thousand things
I should be doing.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.121
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

17:03.156 --> 17:05.623
Well, can I at least have
my sketchbook

17:05.658 --> 17:08.026
so that I can work on my matron
of honour dress.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.127
No.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.195
Rest now.
Maybe later.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.876
What are you doing?

17:24.911 --> 17:26.044
What does it look like
I'm doing?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.278
I'm reading.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.781
Shouldn't you be getting
back to work?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.583
I am not leaving you.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.985
Lee...

17:34.020 --> 17:35.586
[laughs]

17:35.622 --> 17:36.621
Well, that's just silly.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.724
I am perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.995
I know you are but fortunately
you don't have to.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.830
What about the office?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.665
Jesse can handle
the office.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.936
Besides, I wanna be here in case
you actually need something.

17:56.543 --> 18:00.078
You know, there is actually
something I could use.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.612
Ok. Great.
What?

18:01.648 --> 18:04.182
Just a cup of camomile tea.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.149
Okay.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.617
Oh...

18:06.653 --> 18:08.019
Forget it. Never mind.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.420
What?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.589
I just remembered
I'm completely out.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.324
Well, I can go to the mercantile
and get some tea.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's too much bother.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.360
No trouble at all.
I will go.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.464
I will be right back.
In a jiff...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.132
You are the best.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.870
I am. But you stay in bed.

18:25.905 --> 18:26.871
I won't move a muscle.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.939
<i> I'll be right back.</i>

18:51.865 --> 18:54.999
[laughs]

18:55.034 --> 18:56.534
Ah-ha!!!

18:56.569 --> 18:58.136
Lee!

18:58.171 --> 19:00.171
Coulter!

19:00.206 --> 19:01.906
You scared me half to death!

19:01.941 --> 19:05.977
I knew I couldn't trust you.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.846
The light is so much better
down here.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.382
And I really wanted to work
on my dress.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.318
Rosy, resting your mind
is just as important

19:14.354 --> 19:15.586
as resting your body.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.922
Now back up to bed.

19:17.957 --> 19:18.723
Lee...

19:18.758 --> 19:20.091
Uh, uh, bed.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.425
[sighs]

19:21.461 --> 19:23.361
Don't make me carry you.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.395
Oh!

19:29.769 --> 19:32.069
...I know, yeah,
went to Buxton.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.104
Oh, Kevin...

19:33.139 --> 19:34.906
Bill, what can
I get for you?

19:34.941 --> 19:35.706
Just a minute.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.275
Kevin...

19:37.310 --> 19:38.342
Gentlemen...

19:39.646 --> 19:40.678
Folks, uh...

19:42.582 --> 19:44.448
Words out you are looking
for a jury.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.751
No kidding.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.121
You could always delay
the trial another day.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.923
Nice try.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.560
Hello!

19:55.595 --> 19:57.428
<i> Hello, my big boy.</i>

19:57.463 --> 19:59.530
How are you today?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.798
What have you got?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.033
Is that a reindeer?

20:02.068 --> 20:04.535
Will you say night, night to
auntie Rosemary and uncle Lee.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.437
Say night, night.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.406
-Bye, bye.
-Bye.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.207
Have a good sleep.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.007
We'll see you soon.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.142
Let me know if you need
anything.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.044
-Okay, thanks.
-Sweet dreams.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.781
Back to bed with you.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.218
Sweetheart...

20:20.253 --> 20:21.219
Uh-huh.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.420
You okay?

20:22.455 --> 20:25.389
Oh, yes. Just a little tired.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.358
Hmm.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.332
<i> Thank you for showing up</i>
<i> today folks.</i>

20:34.367 --> 20:36.834
Now from this group, I, the
plaintiff and the defendant

20:36.869 --> 20:39.870
will be picking our final six.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.273
You will be given a list
of questions-

20:42.308 --> 20:44.508
Hickam, what are you
doing here?

20:44.544 --> 20:47.712
Jesse said you were looking
for volunteers.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.381
Well, you work for the company
that is being sued.

20:50.416 --> 20:54.619
Yeah, well Clara works for you
and she's here.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.520
It's not the same. Out!

20:59.392 --> 21:02.393
Now these questions will
determine your eligibility.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.628
Yes, Ned.

21:03.663 --> 21:08.232
Say we get chosen, how long
is this trial likely to take?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.467
Up to a week.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.168
A whole week?

21:13.006 --> 21:15.106
Let's get this show
on the road.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.475
What do I know about
the oil industry.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.545
Hmm, well, um, I know
it's a dirty business.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.248
[laughs]

21:24.284 --> 21:26.250
Well, Henry is guilty as sin.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.285
Lucas too.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.789
Even this other oil fella,
Mr. Murphy.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.592
I figure he's up to no good,
as well.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.593
Well, nice try Ned.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.429
You just circled your way back
to impartial.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.830
I am certainly most capable

21:39.866 --> 21:42.500
of putting my personal opinions
to one side

21:42.535 --> 21:44.435
when the situation
demands it.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.673
No offence, Florence but...
really?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.909
Now, who is being biased,
Judge?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.509
[knocks]

22:25.545 --> 22:26.577
Excuse me.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.047
Cornell Frolich.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.048
Constable Grant.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.451
Constable, what can I do
for you?

22:33.486 --> 22:37.388
I am here about the oil dispute
with Gowen Petroleum.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.856
Do you know anything
about it?

22:38.891 --> 22:42.626
Yup. His crude
is very low grade.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.994
Are you sure?

22:44.030 --> 22:46.530
I have the test to prove it.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.106
Take a look.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.646
This is all Greek to me.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.549
The sulphur content
is off the chart.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.917
Smelly oil?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.853
Something like that.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.721
Do you mind if I have
a look around?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.523
Help yourself.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.127
Thanks.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.533
[baby coos]

23:22.568 --> 23:26.404
There you go.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.338
Hi.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.039
Laura?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.209
I am so sorry, I forgot to tell
you I don't need you today.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.110
Oh.

23:33.146 --> 23:34.678
I will still pay you though.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.280
It's not necessary,
Mrs. Thornton.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.348
It most certainly is.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.582
You were hired for the week.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.451
It's not your fault school
was cancelled.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.919
I appreciate it.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.621
Laura, you're here, great.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.689
Um, I was hoping you would
sit with Rosemary.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.924
I have to go to the office.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.560
Jesse can't find a contract
and it has to go out tonight.

23:49.595 --> 23:53.063
I just- I don't want her
to be alone.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.365
Do you mind staying?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.232
Of course.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.267
Thank you.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.137
She hasn't eaten anything
all day, so-

24:00.173 --> 24:01.572
I will bring her some soup.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.374
Thank you. I won't be
very long.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.943
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Laura.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.494
Good afternoon.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.963
Good afternoon, Constable.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.399
What are you doing?

24:28.434 --> 24:32.670
Taking a sample of the crude
for the supplier.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.773
So, you test all
of the shipments?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.642
No. I don't test anything.
The lab does.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.945
But you take the samples
to the lab?

24:40.980 --> 24:44.482
No. Um, that's the foreman's
responsibility.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.586
Thank you.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.365
Hello.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.367
Well, this is a nice surprise.

25:03.402 --> 25:04.802
How is Opal?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.270
She's doing great.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.705
Where are you headed?

25:07.740 --> 25:10.641
Delivering calamine lotion
to Maggie and Timmy.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.809
You all packed?

25:11.844 --> 25:14.278
Packed and ready to go.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.213
I'll meet you at the stagecoach
depot at 7:00.

25:16.249 --> 25:19.617
Yes. And don't be late.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.385
Not a chance.

25:21.420 --> 25:22.453
[laughs]

25:38.738 --> 25:44.542
[phone rings]

25:44.577 --> 25:46.343
Henry Gowen.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.679
Hey, just wanted to let you know
that Murphy's Refinery

25:48.714 --> 25:50.748
has a system in place
to test the oil.

25:50.783 --> 25:51.782
What's the system?

25:51.817 --> 25:54.852
Well, some kid pulls a sample
from the barrel,

25:54.887 --> 25:56.820
and then the foreman
here Cornell,

25:56.856 --> 25:58.222
transports them to the lab

25:58.257 --> 25:59.456
where there is a couple
of technicians.

25:59.492 --> 26:02.526
Cornell? That's not Cornell
Frolich by any chance, is it?

26:02.562 --> 26:03.928
Yeah, it is.

26:03.963 --> 26:04.995
Why? Do you know him?

26:05.031 --> 26:05.930
Yeah, I know him.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.098
I just didn't know he's working
for Sean.

26:08.134 --> 26:11.201
Does Frolich have any reason
to have a grudge against you?

26:11.237 --> 26:15.039
He used to own an oil company.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.040
Used to?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.276
That went out of business
about a month ago.

26:19.312 --> 26:21.178
So what does that have to do
with you?

26:21.213 --> 26:23.614
Trust me he'd figure that
he have enough reason

26:23.649 --> 26:25.716
to want to ruin my reputation.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.187
Ladies and gentlemen
congratulations,

26:30.222 --> 26:33.090
you have been selected
to serve on this jury.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.392
In this case you
will be deciding.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.094
The plaintiff has accused
the defendants

26:37.129 --> 26:40.097
of fraudulent business practise.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.099
<i> Your job is to determine</i>
<i> the facts</i>

26:42.134 --> 26:43.968
<i> based on the evidence that's</i>
<i> presented to you.</i>

26:44.003 --> 26:45.436
<i> And nothing but that evidence.</i>

26:45.471 --> 26:47.371
Is that clear?

26:47.406 --> 26:48.505
Yes.

26:48.541 --> 26:51.575
I will see you back here
tomorrow morning at 9:00AM.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.477
Why didn't you tell me
that you had an oil company

26:53.512 --> 26:55.913
that competed
with Henry Gowen?

26:55.948 --> 26:58.115
I didn't see the point?

27:00.319 --> 27:04.088
This is the report that Gowen
plans to introduce at the trial.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.558
Apparently, it states
that he has quality crude oil.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.596
Well, I guess our reports
just differ.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.736
You know in court credibility
matters to the jury.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.771
Given your bad history
with Gowen

27:20.806 --> 27:23.073
could give them reason not
to believe your report.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.844
Unlike Henry Gowen, I
am strictly legitimate.

27:26.879 --> 27:29.513
I never do anything underhanded.

27:29.548 --> 27:30.581
Excuse me!

27:32.318 --> 27:34.551
Why don't you come in here
for a second.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.357
What's going on?

27:40.393 --> 27:44.762
Well, I just thought how
devastating it must have been

27:44.797 --> 27:49.600
as a family when you had to file
for bankruptcy.

27:49.635 --> 27:53.971
I mean, you are father
and son, right?

27:54.006 --> 27:59.710
You share some
family idiosyncrasies.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.512
Why did you bring Danny
in here for?

28:01.547 --> 28:05.616
Delivering low-quality crude
is a civil matter.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.153
But deliberately
falsifying samples?

28:09.188 --> 28:12.222
That's a criminal offence.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.525
Now, both of you will testify
at the trial,

28:14.560 --> 28:16.794
but I suggest you get
ahead of it

28:16.829 --> 28:18.729
and tell me what
really happened.

28:18.764 --> 28:22.299
And I may ask the judge
to go easy on you.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.970
Otherwise, one of you
is going to jail.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.416
It was me.

28:39.452 --> 28:43.353
I sent the lab
the wrong samples.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.498
Are you actually just going to
stand there and do nothing

28:54.533 --> 28:56.266
while your father takes
responsibility

28:56.302 --> 28:59.536
for something that you did?

29:11.784 --> 29:14.752
[knocking]

29:14.787 --> 29:16.253
Hmm.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.388
Would you like some soup?

29:18.424 --> 29:22.226
Oh, no thank you.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.729
Rosemary, you got
to eat something

29:25.765 --> 29:27.264
to keep up your strength.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.334
I'm just not hungry.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.028
[panicked]
Elizabeth just called!

29:58.063 --> 30:00.898
Rosemary has a high fever!
They need you right away!

30:14.079 --> 30:14.845
105.

30:17.750 --> 30:21.185
Give me some cool water
and cloths.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.094
I can't imagine what's
keeping her.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.832
Sorry, I'm on a deadline.
I can't wait any longer.

30:34.867 --> 30:35.833
No, no, she'll be here.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.936
She probably just got caught up
with a patient.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.604
Come on, five more minutes.

30:40.639 --> 30:41.839
Sorry.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.907
Giddy-up.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.384
<i> Carson!</i>

30:59.391 --> 31:00.891
Faith is with Rosemary,
she's very sick.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.192
I need you to come with me.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.227
Okay.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.530
Okay, let's go.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.998
Yeah.

31:21.747 --> 31:22.613
How is she doing?

31:22.648 --> 31:24.715
We can't get her fever down.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.283
Did you give her aspirin?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.418
Yes, about 15 minutes ago.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.653
What's her temperature?

31:29.688 --> 31:30.721
<i> 105.</i>

31:35.527 --> 31:37.094
Can you give me a glass
of cool water.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.562
Yes, of course, of course.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.596
<i> Rosemary.</i>

31:40.766 --> 31:44.134
Rosemary, I need you
to wake up.

31:44.169 --> 31:47.437
Come on, Rosemary.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.406
Here you go, Carson.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.579
Take a sip.
There you go.

31:55.614 --> 31:56.980
Not too fast.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.083
Good, good.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.757
What are you thinking?

32:06.792 --> 32:09.192
Submersion therapy.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.628
We're going to need
a lot of ice.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.764
Lucas, he'll have plenty
at the saloon.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.032
Okay, great. I'll go.
I'll take the car.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.667
I'll be right back.

32:29.682 --> 32:30.614
This is the last of it.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.015
Thank you so much, Lucas.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.050
If you need anything else...

32:33.085 --> 32:34.117
Okay.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.564
Mr. Frolich's son blamed Gowen

33:20.599 --> 33:22.766
for his father's company
going under.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.167
When he saw Gowen's barrels

33:24.203 --> 33:26.536
he thought that it was a chance
for his payback.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.373
Of course, I'll fire him.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.709
You can press charges but
he did own up to what he did.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.745
No, it's not necessary.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.385
Well, then...

33:41.420 --> 33:42.185
[pounds gavel]

33:42.221 --> 33:44.054
Case is closed.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.857
No hard feelings?

33:46.892 --> 33:48.592
Not at all, Sean.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.199
Why would he accuse you of
putting him out of business?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.635
Well, I cut our prices
and we operated at a loss

33:58.670 --> 34:00.570
when we first started out.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.606
Until you drove Frolich
to bankruptcy?

34:02.641 --> 34:05.308
A fewer competitors
means bigger profits.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.978
Business is a blood sport Lucas,
you ought to know that.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.913
I didn't hear any complaints
from you when you were

34:09.948 --> 34:13.617
counting your money so I don't
expect to hear any now.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.952
Thank you very much, Constable.
I appreciate your help.

34:15.988 --> 34:17.020
Yeah.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.459
I had heard rumours

34:22.494 --> 34:24.995
that he could be a ruthless
business man.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.630
Well, that's Henry Gowen.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.900
Just when you think he has
turned over a new leaf,

he cuts down the whole tree.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.037
Gentlemen.

34:45.951 --> 34:51.288
Oh, folks the case is settled.
There is no trial.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.155
Yes!

34:52.191 --> 34:54.758
But... but-

34:54.793 --> 34:56.693
I'm sorry.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.728
[exhales]

35:05.504 --> 35:07.771
[moans]

35:23.355 --> 35:27.357
Sweetheart, you're awake.

35:27.392 --> 35:30.894
I was so worried about you.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.863
I'm sorry.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.698
That's okay.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.467
I'm just so glad you're alright.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.136
Oh, sweetie.

35:45.110 --> 35:48.378
I could have never made it
through last night without you.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.213
We make a pretty good team,
don't we?

35:50.249 --> 35:52.382
We do.

35:52.417 --> 35:57.387
Which is why you have
to leave right away.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.322
Carson, no. I missed
the deadline.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.390
Technically you haven't.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.726
You have to be in Chicago
in three days, right?

36:02.761 --> 36:04.027
I checked the schedule
there's a train

36:04.062 --> 36:06.696
that leaves to Union City
later today.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.232
From there you take the express
train and you get to Chicago

36:09.268 --> 36:11.168
Monday morning at 8:00AM,

36:11.203 --> 36:13.436
which gives you just enough time
to drop your bags

36:13.472 --> 36:15.772
and make your 9:00AM class.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.374
Really?

36:17.409 --> 36:19.109
You didn't unpack,
did you?

36:19.144 --> 36:20.043
No.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.412
[laughs]

36:29.755 --> 36:32.756
I'm sorry to have worried
everyone.

36:32.791 --> 36:36.459
I'm just glad you're
on the mend.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.696
I am, thank you.

36:39.731 --> 36:44.601
Now, tell me everything
that has happened.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.536
There will be plenty of time
to catch up

36:46.572 --> 36:48.138
when you're back on your feet.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.874
For now, I'm going
to let you sleep.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.076
Thank you.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.778
Always.

36:57.683 --> 37:01.785
Between my loving husband
and my wonderful friends,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.853
I'm one of the lucky ones.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.403
You're getting there.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.072
How are you feeling?

37:22.107 --> 37:23.206
Hungry.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.542
Hungry? Really?
Well, that's good.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.576
Is there anything she can't eat?

37:26.612 --> 37:29.679
No. Whatever she wants.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.514
Well, I should get
to the stagecoach.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.649
Yes, right.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.884
Please tell Faith we're sorry
we can't see her off.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.019
Yes.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.420
She understands.

37:37.456 --> 37:42.259
Uh, Carson, I just want
to say thank you.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.228
Really. I appreciate it.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.096
You're welcome, Lee.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.530
Okay.

37:47.566 --> 37:48.865
[sighs]

37:48.900 --> 37:51.401
So, eggs and bacon?

37:51.436 --> 37:52.469
And toast?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.170
You got it.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.140
Lee?

37:57.175 --> 37:58.975
Yes.

37:59.011 --> 38:02.312
Thank you for taking
such good care of me.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.581
Of course.

38:12.324 --> 38:15.058
You seem upset the trial
is not happening.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.893
I would have thought
you'd be relieved.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.663
Just putting this jury together
for nothing, it's just...

38:19.698 --> 38:20.930
Oh, don't worry.

38:20.966 --> 38:21.965
With Henry Gowen in town,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.633
I'm sure you'll have plenty
of opportunities.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.201
[chuckles]

38:28.173 --> 38:29.639
Henry.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.610
I need to make something clear.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.245
I'm an honest businessman.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.780
I realize what you did
wasn't illegal,

38:36.815 --> 38:39.249
but it was borderline unethical.

38:39.284 --> 38:41.751
Borderline unethical?

38:41.787 --> 38:43.953
Who decides that?
Is that you?

38:43.989 --> 38:47.490
The judge, he interprets the law
but you decide what's unethical?

38:47.526 --> 38:50.827
Henry you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.363
We're a major employer
in this valley

38:53.398 --> 38:55.965
if we go under,
people go hungry.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.100
It was us or them.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.436
Well, that's a line that needs
to be drawn somewhere,

38:59.471 --> 39:01.838
so tell me where is it drawn
for you?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.907
I'll tell you when we get there.

39:14.753 --> 39:18.355
I'm really glad you were able
to help Henry.

39:18.390 --> 39:22.525
You know, your loyalty to your
friends is very admirable.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.494
But?

39:24.529 --> 39:27.797
No but, just an observation.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.799
Hmm.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.001
I am sure you will be very busy,

39:32.037 --> 39:37.006
but please write whenever
you get lonely.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.042
Thank you, Elizabeth.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.813
Bye Jack.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.183
I made you a couple of
sandwiches for your trip.

39:47.219 --> 39:48.418
Ohhh.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.586

Thank you, Bill.

-I'll miss you.
-I'll miss you.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.000
It will go by quickly.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.404
Are you trying to convince us,
or yourself?

40:13.245 --> 40:14.744
I miss you already.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.246
Me too.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.847
We can talk all the time,

40:17.883 --> 40:21.351
write letters and I'll be there
in a couple of months.

40:21.386 --> 40:22.519
Promise?

40:22.554 --> 40:24.053
Cross my heart.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.189
Call me as soon as
you get there.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.223
I'll be running to class.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.760
That's right. Just call me
as soon as you can.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.730
I love you, Carson Shepherd.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.332
I love you, Faith Carter.
