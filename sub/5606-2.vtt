a bomb in a briefcase

04:47.317 --> 04:49.317

of the Monroe building.

04:49.319 --> 04:50.952
Turns out
that was just a decoy,

04:50.954 --> 04:53.054
'cause there was a secondary
device in the trunk

04:53.056 --> 04:54.722
of this car here,

04:54.724 --> 04:56.324
right at the edge
of the frozen zone.

04:56.326 --> 04:58.293
Basically, whoever did this

04:58.295 --> 04:59.494
was deliberately targeting
first responders.

04:59.496 --> 05:00.995
It also means

05:00.997 --> 05:03.031
that he was familiar
with HPD evacuation

05:03.033 --> 05:04.499
and frozen zone
protocol.

05:04.501 --> 05:07.535
Okay, whoever did this had
to have been watching

05:07.537 --> 05:09.170
to know when to detonate
the device, right?

05:09.172 --> 05:11.005

05:25.521 --> 05:28.022

still trying to unscramble

10:42.831 --> 10:44.064
the voice on the audio,

10:44.066 --> 10:46.733
but apparently the poem,
"Ladybug Ladybug,"

10:46.735 --> 10:50.504
has several different versions
dating all the way back to 1744.

10:50.506 --> 10:53.207
Now, the rhyme was inspired
by a technique

10:53.209 --> 10:55.375
of smoking insects
out of gardens.

10:55.377 --> 10:57.244
In the poem,
the ladybug

10:57.246 --> 10:59.479
can fly away from
the smoke and fire,

10:59.481 --> 11:00.614
but her children burning

11:00.616 --> 11:03.050
is actually a reference
to the larvae

11:03.052 --> 11:04.651
left behind on the plant,

11:04.653 --> 11:06.086
still trapped
in their pupal cases.

11:06.088 --> 11:08.388
Remember, trapping
people inside his fires

11:08.390 --> 11:10.457
was Duclair's signature.

11:10.459 --> 11:14.294
And weaving his laces refers
to an insect that manages

11:14.296 --> 11:16.330
to undo its pupal case
and escape,

11:16.332 --> 11:18.565
which seems like
a clear reference to Duclair

11:18.567 --> 11:19.866
escaping from prison.

11:19.868 --> 11:22.135
We're checking libraries
on the Island

11:22.137 --> 11:24.805
for books with that poem in it
that may have been checked out.

11:24.807 --> 11:26.340
We'll, uh, cross-reference
all those names

11:26.342 --> 11:28.108
against Duclair's associates.
All right.

11:28.110 --> 11:30.611
Well, whatever the case may be,
I'm thinking the identity

11:30.613 --> 11:34.248
of the poet is
probably inside this box.

opportunities with Five-O.

Duke, it's me.
I need you to run a plate.

14:32.027 --> 14:35.095
Most of this junk is
from a bunch of twisted women.

14:35.097 --> 14:38.632
They all want to marry Duclair
and have conjugal visits

14:38.634 --> 14:40.967
and make little
pyromaniac babies.

14:40.969 --> 14:43.003
Okay. Well, is there anybody

14:43.005 --> 14:45.172
who Duclair had any regular
correspondence with?

14:45.174 --> 14:46.973
One guy. He trades letters

14:46.975 --> 14:49.142
with a former cellie of his
from Halawa.

14:49.144 --> 14:51.178
The name is...

14:51.180 --> 14:52.612
Tim Richards.

14:52.614 --> 14:55.148
Did a stretch
for commercial arson,

14:55.150 --> 14:58.051
and has some priors with HPD
for grand larceny and forgery.

14:58.053 --> 14:59.085
And the letters

14:59.087 --> 15:01.721
that he wrote to Duclair,
they trace back...

15:02.184 --> 15:04.150
to a P.O. box in Honolulu

15:04.152 --> 15:06.186
rented to Richards.
See, that's a little suspect.

15:06.187 --> 15:08.134
Why wouldn't he send them
from his own place?

15:08.158 --> 15:08.822
Yeah.

15:08.823 --> 15:10.422
And what makes it
even more odd

15:10.424 --> 15:12.157
is that the letters
are just small talk--

15:12.159 --> 15:13.359
like news, weather,

15:13.361 --> 15:15.661
- sports stuff.
- Yeah, but I guarantee you

15:15.663 --> 15:17.529
there's a hidden message
inside the text.

15:17.531 --> 15:19.431
That's what
I was thinking, but...

15:19.433 --> 15:21.900
Actually, it's not about
what's inside those envelopes;

15:21.902 --> 15:23.502
it's about what's on them.

15:23.504 --> 15:26.605
Now, when the lab was processing
all those letters and envelopes

15:26.607 --> 15:28.941
recovered from Duclair's cell,
one of the techs

15:28.943 --> 15:31.543
noticed that the stamp...

15:31.545 --> 15:33.312
on this envelope
didn't quite line up

15:33.314 --> 15:34.913
- with the postmark.
- Hmm.

15:34.915 --> 15:37.216
And when she peeled it back...

15:37.218 --> 15:38.784
she found this.

15:40.153 --> 15:41.987
Wila writing.
Mm-hmm.

15:41.989 --> 15:44.156
Easy to conceal,
hard to detect.

15:44.158 --> 15:45.958
Wila writing

15:45.960 --> 15:47.926
is how convicts secretly
communicate with each other

15:47.928 --> 15:49.228
inside and outside of jail.

15:49.230 --> 15:51.430
Yeah, but not every
convict can do it.

15:51.432 --> 15:52.965
It's kind of
an art form.

15:52.967 --> 15:55.267
Maybe if you had priors
for, say, forgery,

15:55.269 --> 15:57.236
then you'd
probably be good at it.

15:57.238 --> 15:58.971
Right. And the notes
on the back of these stamps

15:58.973 --> 16:00.172
read like a series
of love letters.

16:00.174 --> 16:02.841
Clearly,
Richards idolizes Duclair.

16:02.843 --> 16:06.578
He gushes about his skills
and technique as an arsonist.

16:06.580 --> 16:09.448
He wants to carry the torch
and continue his work.

16:09.450 --> 16:10.949
"Carry the torch"?

16:10.951 --> 16:12.685
- Richards' words, not mine.
- Yeah, but there's

16:12.687 --> 16:14.420
nothing in here
about some direct plan

16:14.422 --> 16:16.522
to bust Duclair out of jail,
is there?

16:16.524 --> 16:18.223
Right, but hold on a
second-- we don't have

16:18.225 --> 16:19.958
Duclair's letters to Richards
going out of Halawa, right?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.488
We only have one side
of the conversation.

16:21.512 --> 16:23.275
Right. So I'm guessing
that Duclair was calling

16:23.276 --> 16:24.998
the shots on his own escape.
I'm with him.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.331
Let's get a warrant
for Richards' place,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.000
see if we can find
those letters.

16:30.136 --> 16:31.904
<i>It's just an office,</i>
<i>Danny, it's an office.</i>

16:31.906 --> 16:33.305
That's... that's like
your girlfriend saying,

16:33.307 --> 16:34.773
"It's just a toothbrush."

16:34.775 --> 16:37.376
Next thing you know,
you're out closet space, okay?

16:37.378 --> 16:39.078
And all your stuff's
been moved to the attic--

16:39.080 --> 16:41.714
including your sports
memorabilia-- and your garage

16:41.716 --> 16:44.550
is turned into
an arts-and-crafts studio.

16:44.552 --> 16:47.086
How did Rachel ever
say yes to you?

16:47.088 --> 16:48.587
Wow.
Huh?

16:48.589 --> 16:51.123
Okay, this is all
I am saying, all right?

16:51.125 --> 16:52.658
If you encourage Jerry,

16:52.660 --> 16:53.992
he is going
to expect something.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.027
What? A badge.

16:55.029 --> 16:56.361
He's not getting a badge.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.696
He's just getting an office.

16:57.698 --> 16:59.164
Well, an office creates
He's not getting a badge.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.333
expectation for a badge.
Then he's gonna be disappointed.

17:01.335 --> 17:02.534
Isn't he?
Yeah, he'll be disappointed.

17:02.536 --> 17:03.869
He'll be disappointed
for about five minutes,

17:03.871 --> 17:05.938
until he pouts and then you
cave, because you are spineless,

17:05.940 --> 17:09.007
and you give him a badge.
I'm not gonna cave.

17:09.009 --> 17:10.409
Speaking of caving,

17:10.411 --> 17:11.609
what happened?

17:11.612 --> 17:13.377
What, you-you just bailed
on the proposal?

17:13.380 --> 17:14.613
No, I didn't bail.

17:14.615 --> 17:16.013
I've been planning the op.

17:16.016 --> 17:18.217
The op?
Yeah.

17:18.219 --> 17:20.152
I secured a ring.
I reconned a location.

17:20.154 --> 17:21.386
Now I just got to execute.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.655
Wow. I mean, it just,
it sounds so romantic

17:23.656 --> 17:25.357
the way you say it,
you know?

17:25.358 --> 17:27.792
I mean, I could see it now--
you and Catherine

17:27.795 --> 17:29.762
in matching
camouflage cargo pants

17:29.764 --> 17:31.730
on some very exotic
shooting range,

17:31.732 --> 17:34.199
and you get down on one knee,
and you say, "Babe,

17:34.201 --> 17:36.468
I want you to join my unit
for a lifelong mission."

17:36.470 --> 17:38.771
I mean, it's every girl's fairy tale.
Oh, yeah, you want

17:38.773 --> 17:39.738
to hear a secret?
Yeah.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.006
You do?
Mm-hmm.

17:41.008 --> 17:42.708
Sometimes when you speak,
when your mouth opens

17:42.710 --> 17:44.743
and you speak, all I
hear is "wa-wa-wa-wa""

17:44.745 --> 17:46.812
It's like I'm in a
Charlie Brown cartoon,

17:46.814 --> 17:48.413
only you're Linus,
with better hair.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.315
Why do I got to be Linus?

17:50.317 --> 17:52.484
That's your take-away? Really?
That's your take-away from that?

17:52.486 --> 17:53.519
Oh.
What?

17:53.521 --> 17:55.120
2:00, coming out
of the strip mall.

17:55.122 --> 17:56.321
Richards' P.O. said

17:56.323 --> 17:59.925
<i>he was delivering barbecue</i>
<i>for a local joint.</i>

17:59.927 --> 18:01.827
That's him.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.601
Get out of the car!

18:35.863 --> 18:38.697
Let me see your hands.
Show me your hands right now!

18:40.300 --> 18:42.434
Don't do anything stupid,
all right?

18:43.303 --> 18:45.270
Get out of the car.
Put your hands

18:45.272 --> 18:46.672
behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

18:46.674 --> 18:48.122
On your knees, on your knees.
What the hell?

18:48.147 --> 18:49.209
Take it easy!

18:49.210 --> 18:50.843
Hands behind your head.
Hands behind your head!

18:50.845 --> 18:52.711
- I didn't do anything!
- Why'd you run?

18:52.713 --> 18:55.647
'Cause you cut me off
and started chasing me, man!

18:59.886 --> 19:01.086
Is he searching my trunk?

19:01.088 --> 19:03.021
You can't do that, man!
Okay, shut up.

19:03.023 --> 19:05.557
All right, the car looks clean.

19:05.559 --> 19:07.192
I'll get CSU to take
it to the garage

19:07.194 --> 19:08.327
and look it
over properly.

19:08.329 --> 19:10.128
Get up.

19:10.130 --> 19:13.799
I'll make it simple
for you, all right?

19:13.801 --> 19:15.400
We found the wila letters

19:15.402 --> 19:17.069
that you sent Duclair.
Now, if there's

19:17.071 --> 19:19.271
another device out there,
you need to tell us

19:19.273 --> 19:20.873
about it right now.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.341
I'm not saying

19:22.343 --> 19:23.909
another word without a lawyer.

19:23.911 --> 19:25.477
You want a lawyer?
Okay, well, we're executing

19:25.479 --> 19:27.079
a search warrant
on your house right now.

19:50.580 --> 19:51.980
Look, I don't know how many

19:51.982 --> 19:53.749
more ways to say
I don't know anything

19:53.751 --> 19:56.018
about any bombs
planted in my house.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.653
Okay, I don't think
you understand

19:57.655 --> 19:58.887
the gravity
of the situation.

19:58.889 --> 20:00.255
Two police officers
are dead, okay?

20:00.257 --> 20:02.591
Three more are in the hospital
fighting for their lives.

20:02.593 --> 20:03.792
Now, there's no lawyer.

20:03.794 --> 20:06.261
You don't get a phone call.
No one's coming.

20:06.263 --> 20:08.230
All right? And you and me,
we're not leaving this room

20:08.232 --> 20:09.264
until I get answers.

20:09.266 --> 20:11.967
And this is the last time
I ask you nicely.

20:17.574 --> 20:19.341
I wrote the letters
for someone else.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.776
Oh.

20:20.778 --> 20:22.110
It's the truth.

20:22.112 --> 20:25.280
Before I got out,
Duclair came at me.

20:25.282 --> 20:27.850
He heard from guys on the
block that I did wila

20:27.852 --> 20:29.117
for people inside.
He said I could make

20:29.119 --> 20:30.786
some easy money if I met with
a friend of his when I got it.

20:30.788 --> 20:32.995
Great. What's
Duclair's friend's name?

20:32.996 --> 20:34.571
I didn't ask, 'cause
What's his name?

20:34.594 --> 20:35.859
I didn't want to know.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.261
I met him at a coffee shop
downtown for five minutes.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.463
He needed some letters
transcribed into wila.

20:41.465 --> 20:44.766
He gave me a key to a
P.O. box near the mall.

20:44.768 --> 20:46.268
He'd leave the
letters inside,

20:46.270 --> 20:48.370
I'd pick them up once a week,
transcribe them,

20:48.372 --> 20:49.671
take them back the next day.

20:49.673 --> 20:51.273
There was always cash
waiting for me.

20:51.275 --> 20:53.475
All right, I'm gonna show you
some photos, and you're gonna...

20:53.477 --> 20:55.110
you're gonna point out
Duclair's friend, all right?

20:55.112 --> 20:57.212
He wore sunglasses
and a baseball cap.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.448
Looked like a
thousand other guys.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.718
Look, you're wasting
your time with me.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.220
Whoever planted those bombs
is still out there.

21:12.463 --> 21:14.730
♪ ♪

21:35.585 --> 21:36.818
You transcribed those letters
for Duclair,

21:36.820 --> 21:38.654
which means you knew
he was planning an escape.

21:38.656 --> 21:39.988
That makes you
an accessory,

21:39.990 --> 21:42.991
and that gives me the right
to send you back to Halawa.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.863
Give me a minute, Lou.
This can't wait.

21:48.665 --> 21:50.365
Okay, we're not done,
all right?

21:50.367 --> 21:52.234
I'll be right back.

21:55.305 --> 21:58.373
You need to
listen to this.

21:58.375 --> 22:02.077
I think the barking dog might be
a problem with the neighbors.

22:02.079 --> 22:05.280
I know you're attached to him,
but he needs to be put down.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.317
Consider it done.

22:08.319 --> 22:10.986
Duclair made this phone call
right after you and Danny

22:10.988 --> 22:13.622
left him from up at Halawa
this morning.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.591
The guys in the lab unscrambled
the voice on the zip file.

22:16.593 --> 22:18.460
The poet's voice
is a direct match

22:18.462 --> 22:20.228
to the guy who
picked up this call.

22:20.230 --> 22:21.930
All right, so Richards
is telling the truth.

22:21.932 --> 22:23.432
He was the middleman,

22:23.434 --> 22:25.968
but Duclair doesn't trust him
anymore. He wants him dead.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.904
I think the barking dog might be
a problem with the neighbors.

22:28.906 --> 22:32.674
I know you're attached to him,
but he needs to be put down.

22:32.676 --> 22:35.310
Consider it done.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.245
Now, I'm no genius,

22:37.247 --> 22:39.181
but you don't have
to be a genius

22:39.183 --> 22:42.084
to figure out
who the dog is.

22:42.919 --> 22:45.954
Duclair put the hit
on you.

22:45.956 --> 22:48.090
And your boy was willing
to go along with it.

22:48.092 --> 22:51.960
That bomb at your house
was meant for you.

22:51.962 --> 22:54.296
You're running out
of friends real fast.

22:54.298 --> 22:56.898
You want to stay ative,

22:56.900 --> 22:59.067
give us the name.

23:10.113 --> 23:11.613
You knew all along?

23:11.615 --> 23:13.515
Huh?

23:13.517 --> 23:15.951
I got an itch
on the end of my nose.

23:15.953 --> 23:17.919
Can one of you guys
get it for me?

23:17.921 --> 23:19.755
Get up.

23:22.425 --> 23:23.892
You're gonna pay

23:23.894 --> 23:25.694
for what you did
to those officers, all right?

23:25.696 --> 23:27.963
I swear to God,
as long as I live and breathe,

23:27.965 --> 23:30.405
you're never gonna see the light
of day outside of this place.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.636
You're gonna want to take that.

23:41.744 --> 23:44.012
Hello, Commander.

23:44.847 --> 23:47.182
Who is this?

23:47.184 --> 23:48.550
That's not important.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.653
What's important now
is that you look out the window.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.235
Do I have your attention now?

24:40.237 --> 24:41.970
You had my attention
this morning

24:41.972 --> 24:44.005
when you murdered
those two officers.

24:44.007 --> 24:47.042
Listen to me very carefully,
Commander.

24:47.044 --> 24:50.045
You will walk out of the
prison gates with Mr. Duclair

24:50.047 --> 24:53.014
tomorrow morning
at exactly 7:00 a.m.

24:53.016 --> 24:55.750
You will wait there
for further instructions.

24:55.752 --> 24:57.552
If you fail to appear,

24:57.554 --> 25:01.223
you will have the blood of more
innocent people on your hands.

25:42.995 --> 25:44.928
Are you still breathing,
Commander?

25:44.930 --> 25:47.564
'Cause that feels an awful lot
like the light of day.

25:47.566 --> 25:49.900
Yeah, well, enjoy it.
By the time the sun goes down,

25:49.902 --> 25:51.201
you're gonna
be back inside.

25:51.203 --> 25:54.004
There you go again,
making promises you can't keep.

25:58.876 --> 26:00.811
How we looking?

26:00.813 --> 26:02.679
GPS signal's really strong.

26:02.681 --> 26:04.414
As long as he keeps
those shoes on,

26:04.416 --> 26:07.050
we should be able to track him
wherever he goes.

26:07.919 --> 26:09.353
Danny, that burner phone

26:09.355 --> 26:11.555
that our poet used
to contact Steve last night

26:11.557 --> 26:12.789
just came back online.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.658
We should have an exact
location in a few seconds.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.259
Got a SWAT team
that's ready to roll

26:16.261 --> 26:18.662
as soon as we give 'em
a location.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.732
All right,
I'll stay on with you.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.641
Danny, we got to go.

26:30.643 --> 26:31.975
What's going on? Where is he?

26:31.977 --> 26:33.176
Right outside the palace.

26:35.847 --> 26:36.947
Hey! No!

26:36.949 --> 26:39.816
Don't touch it!
Get back!

26:39.818 --> 26:41.985
Step away from the van!

27:00.938 --> 27:03.040
Get everybody out of the palace

27:03.042 --> 27:05.542
and back everybody away from
this van. We got to evacuate.

27:05.544 --> 27:07.377
Everybody move! Move!

27:17.289 --> 27:18.955
I sense a road trip coming on.

27:20.692 --> 27:23.160
You've tracked my cell signal

27:23.162 --> 27:26.530
and heard from your men, so you
know your options are limited.

27:26.532 --> 27:27.698
What do you want?

27:27.700 --> 27:29.700
Take Mr. Duclair
from the prison grounds

27:29.702 --> 27:32.035
and drive north on Highway 3.

27:32.037 --> 27:33.670
If you do anything

27:33.672 --> 27:37.207
other than that,
'Iolani Palace is rubble.

27:37.209 --> 27:39.910
If your bomb squad tries
to defuse the device

27:39.912 --> 27:44.915
or anyone follows you, the bomb
will be remotely detonated.

27:44.917 --> 27:46.650
There will be no second chances.

27:46.652 --> 27:49.019
Okay, fine. Where am I going?

27:51.356 --> 27:53.423
I'll tell you.

28:08.806 --> 28:10.207
Kono, would you
please just...

28:10.209 --> 28:12.375
come here and sit with me?

28:15.179 --> 28:18.381
We had two Yakuza sitting
outside our house yesterday.

28:19.484 --> 28:20.784
I knew we should've taken up

28:20.786 --> 28:22.052
Chin's offer
on a protection detail.

28:22.054 --> 28:25.655
Look, if I thought we were
in danger, I would have.

28:26.491 --> 28:28.425
You know how
Shioma operates.

28:28.427 --> 28:31.962
If he sent men to hurt us,
we never would have seen them.

28:31.964 --> 28:34.998
Okay? He's just posturing,
trying to intimidate us.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.068
He needs us to get that money
back from Gabriel.

28:38.070 --> 28:41.638
And what happens
when he finds out we can't?

28:44.375 --> 28:47.444
<i>The minute Steve</i>
<i>makes the drop with Duclair,</i>

28:47.446 --> 28:49.613
the bomb squad's gonna move
in, they're gonna defuse

28:49.615 --> 28:51.515
the device in the van.
When that's done,

28:51.517 --> 28:55.252
we got birds standing by to move
us in on Duclair's location.

28:55.254 --> 28:56.920
And this is surveillance footage
from the security camera

28:56.922 --> 28:58.188
in the front of the palace.

29:04.662 --> 29:06.296
Got him.
Nice.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.667
All right.

29:10.669 --> 29:13.303
Andre Trout, manslaughter two,

29:13.305 --> 29:14.671
arson first degree.

29:14.673 --> 29:16.439
Looks like he set
some brushfires

29:16.441 --> 29:17.707
back in Northern California

29:17.709 --> 29:19.142
in 2003

29:19.144 --> 29:20.911
when he was still
a juvenile.

29:20.913 --> 29:23.580
And one of 'em
killed a firefighter.

29:23.582 --> 29:27.050
Convicted in juvie court
at age 13.

29:27.052 --> 29:29.452
Maxed out in 2013.

29:29.454 --> 29:33.056
DMV records have him moving
to Oahu last June.

29:33.058 --> 29:36.193
Wait, wasn't Duclair
originally from California?

29:36.195 --> 29:38.895
Yeah, Southern California.
But, look, the dates don't work.

29:38.897 --> 29:41.832
Trout was inside when Duclair
was setting his fires.

29:41.834 --> 29:44.634
All right, then.
What's the connection?

29:44.636 --> 29:46.870
Well, why don't we go ask him?

29:51.442 --> 29:53.844
You're gonna stop

Just trust the plan.

31:13.425 --> 31:15.191

32:26.732 --> 32:28.131
What does it say?

32:28.133 --> 32:30.367
It says,
"Who killed Duclair?

"'I,' said the sparrow,
'with my bow and arrow.'

33:33.130 --> 33:35.198
As the end
of its life would approach,

homework, though,

39:38.796 --> 39:39.962
I'll give him that.

39:39.964 --> 39:42.130

anything about me.

Freedom is my prison.

40:49.999 --> 40:53.368
Okay, I'm done
