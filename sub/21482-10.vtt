The world will have to
deal with us.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.760
<i>Previously on The 4400...</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:46.720
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400,

00:46.840 --> 00:48.440
but you are on
the wrong path here.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.400
And you've always
been rebellious.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.760
But I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.960
Or is it just me?

00:56.040 --> 00:57.520
I'm shrinking.
What did you do to me?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.200
I met Cora.
She has an amazing ability.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.000
She can actually
make people younger.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.920
- Isabelle?
- Daddy!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.040
If your mother were here,
she'd want us to do this.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.560
She'd want us to be
a family again.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.600
When your wife fainted
this morning,

01:09.680 --> 01:10.760
she was a young woman.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.040
When she woke up
less than a minute later,

01:13.160 --> 01:15.120
she was 50 years older?

01:15.240 --> 01:16.560
Richard, I'm dying.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.200
There's a faction of elites

01:18.280 --> 01:21.680
who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.400
I call them "The Marked."

01:25.520 --> 01:26.720
When we need him...

01:27.520 --> 01:28.960
he'll be there for us.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.200
Mr. Tyler,

01:33.680 --> 01:35.080
can you hear my voice?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.240
He's been under
for almost 20 minutes.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.520
We should have begun
the procedure already.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.400
Where have you been?

01:53.480 --> 01:54.440
Who are you?

02:03.480 --> 02:04.840
We have to work fast.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.600
This is our only chance.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.080
I've practiced enough...

02:10.720 --> 02:11.920
with plenty of time.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.400
Tonight, Richard Tyler
becomes a father.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.960
Are you okay?

02:32.200 --> 02:33.160
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.880
Just had a... weird dream.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.800
You wanna talk about it?

02:38.600 --> 02:39.640
No, I'm okay.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.880
You should go back to bed.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.240
I'll be right there.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.280
Ready, you're ready ?

03:14.520 --> 03:15.520
Daddy loves you.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.840
It's nice to see you happy,
sweetheart.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.840
Daddy's been wanting that
for long time.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.360
Who are you?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.200
Who am I?

04:16.320 --> 04:18.480
I'm Lily... your wife.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.560
Who else would I be?

<i>You're not lily.
Lily is dead.</i>

05:26.880 --> 05:28.640
- Dead?
- You got old. You passed on.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.080
No, you're wrong.
I'm...

05:30.680 --> 05:32.600
I'm right here.
I didn't die.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.400
Where have you been?
How did you get here?

05:36.440 --> 05:39.000
Well, I woke up
about an hour ago. I...

05:39.640 --> 05:42.400
I wasn't sure where I was.
Not exactly, but...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.240
Somehow knew
you'd be home soon,

05:45.400 --> 05:46.680
and you'd have Isabelle.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.200
That's the last thing I remember.
I was...

05:52.440 --> 05:55.280
I was looking for her at the Center,
and she wasn't in her crib.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.320
You look different, Richard.
You look sad.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.640
- You are not real.
- You keep saying that, but I feel real.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.960
I mean I remember
everything about my life,

06:04.360 --> 06:05.440
about us.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.560
I can pick things up.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.080
I can touch things.

06:13.000 --> 06:13.960
You.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.000
You can feel that, right?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.520
I can't explain
where I've been, Richard,

06:23.200 --> 06:24.520
or how I got here, but...

06:25.600 --> 06:27.280
I'm not questioning it, either.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.080
I'm here.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.080
Isn't that enough?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.240
<i>Can I ask you
a question?</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:52.440
Sure.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.320
You're left-handed.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.760
Of course.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.760
- Is there a question coming?
- You already answered it.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.680
I've been studying the reports
on who survives the promicin shot,

07:05.800 --> 07:07.320
and who doesn't.
Did you know

07:07.400 --> 07:10.360
nine out of ten
left-handed people

07:10.440 --> 07:12.240
who take the shot,
survive?

07:13.640 --> 07:15.040
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.560
I learned that a couple weeks ago,
but I didn't know...

07:17.760 --> 07:18.920
what it meant...

07:19.680 --> 07:20.880
until now.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.520
There.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.600
There's a small part of the brain
called the corpus callosum.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.760
It's like a bundle of wires
that connects the two hemispheres.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.520
It's usually slightly larger
in lefties than it is in righties.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.960
That's why the lefties survive.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.680
The size of that part of the brain
helps determine whether or not

07:40.760 --> 07:44.160
you'll be able to integrate
a new neurotransmitter.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.720
Well, how big
does it have to be?

07:47.120 --> 07:48.960
I don't know... yet.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.840
But I think I can figure it out.
And if I do...

07:52.640 --> 07:54.600
A simple cat scan will tell me

07:54.680 --> 07:57.360
how anyone's body
will react to the shot.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.040
And you'd know in advance
whether or not you'd live or die.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.760
The shot wouldn't have to
kill anyone anymore.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.960
How long do you need?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.600
A couple of months,
maybe less.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.640
This is huge.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.440
Keep working.
I'll get you anything you need, okay?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.960
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get in contact with Collier.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.080
If this test is really
only a few months away,

08:19.280 --> 08:21.120
all he has to do
is make an announcement,

08:21.360 --> 08:23.600
telling people that are
thinking about taking the shot

08:23.920 --> 08:25.080
to simply wait.

08:25.840 --> 08:26.880
This is great.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.160
Hey, Tom.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.520
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the hallway?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.560
Is everything all right?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.640
Yeah, I'm... fine.
I've just...

09:56.120 --> 09:57.280
had a strange morning.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.920
Well, join the club.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.280
We've just had a surprise visit
from Rebecca Parrish.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.680
Some might say an ambush.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.840
The director of national
intelligence is here?

10:05.520 --> 10:08.600
She's been in Meghan's office
the past 20 minutes, and that's not all.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.320
She's asked to see us.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.520
I don't think she likes to wait.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.360
Morning, agent Baldwin,
agent Skouris.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.720
I'm Rebecca Parrish,
and it is a pleasure to meet you.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.240
The pleasure's all ours.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.520
I know that you have difficult jobs
here at NTAC.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.160
But lately,
it seems that we've had

10:32.280 --> 10:34.440
nothing but bad news
coming out of Seattle.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.360
Promicin use is growing.

10:36.640 --> 10:40.440
The founding of Promise City
was a major defeat for this agency,

10:40.560 --> 10:42.000
and in the administration.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.840
It's temporary.
We'll arrest...

10:44.080 --> 10:45.720
Collier,
and we'll shut that place down.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.120
I like your attitude,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.960
but you'll forgive me
if I'm not reassured.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.640
Because recently,
it seems like we're...

10:52.720 --> 10:54.120
even botching the little things.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.120
We had Richard Tyler and his daughter
surrounded, outnumbered.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.520
The situation was in hand,
and we lost him anyway.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.240
Well, with all
due respect,

11:03.360 --> 11:06.880
I was there, and that situation
was anything but "in hand."

11:07.360 --> 11:09.880
Richard Tyler has become
an extremely powerful man.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.840
I understand,
but we can't simply just

11:11.920 --> 11:13.480
throw our hands up,
now, can we?

11:13.720 --> 11:16.080
In two weeks,
I'm being asked to testify

11:16.200 --> 11:17.640
before a congressional subcommittee

11:17.720 --> 11:20.120
on the progress of the war
against promicin.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.000
I'll be here for the entire week
to prepare,

11:23.080 --> 11:25.880
and I would like to go back
with a victory.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.920
So, you want us
to bring in Richard.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.600
Ms. Parrish asked to meet
my two best agents.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.840
That's why you're here.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.160
That's also why you're heading up
a task force to find the Tylers.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.200
I will be checking in
on your progress.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.000
I trust this won't be a problem.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.200
Agent Baldwin?

11:47.920 --> 11:49.800
Did you have something
you needed to say?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.200
I'm...

12:00.040 --> 12:01.960
sure Tom just wants
to get to work.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.520
We'll find the Tylers for you.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.880
I don't know
what's happening, Diana.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.520
It's like I'm seeing myself
in the future, only it's not me.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.680
I'm doing things
I would never do.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.200
What if
they're not just dreams?

12:15.320 --> 12:16.920
What if
they're someone else's memories?

12:17.040 --> 12:20.120
What if they really did put something
inside me when I was in that hospital?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.840
What if it's starting
to affect me?

12:22.120 --> 12:23.400
I'm becoming
one of the marked.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.520
Listen,

12:27.120 --> 12:28.560
Even if you're right,

12:28.960 --> 12:31.200
it hasn't happened yet.
You're still you.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.760
- Okay, so we can fight it.
- How?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.840
Well, have you been to see a doctor
since these dreams began?

12:37.360 --> 12:39.200
- No.
- Okay, well, why don't you start there?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.280
Go find yourself a private physician,
get yourself checked out.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.200
We're supposed to be
looking for Richard.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.720
Just go.
Go.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.120
I'll cover for you.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.360
Go.
Okay.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.400
She looks so much older.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.880
How long
have I been gone?

13:13.040 --> 13:14.040
A little while.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.400
More than a year.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400
Tell me what happened.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.120
I want to hear it all.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.400
Why do you look so sad?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.200
I buried you, Lily.
I mourned you.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.520
I never imagined
I'd be sitting beside you again,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.000
and I don't wanna waste
the time we have with explanations.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.240
We have all the time
in the world, though.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.720
Why wouldn't we?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.280
You still don't believe
I'm real, do you?

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
I don't know.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.240
If I let myself believe it,
and I turn out to be wrong...

13:59.320 --> 14:00.880
I'm not sure
I could live with that.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.200
Let's just see, okay?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.920
We'll just lay here
for a while...

14:11.160 --> 14:13.680
and if I'm still beside you
when we wake up...

14:14.920 --> 14:16.120
I guess we're real.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.440
- You saved these pictures of us.
- Of course I did.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.040
Who's this?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.240
She's a friend of mine.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.320
She lived at the 4400 Center
after you were gone.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.480
She's pretty.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.720
She looks nice, too.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.800
I can see why
you saved the picture.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.560
I don't know.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.720
There's nothing different
about me, Diana.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.520
I had every test
they could give me.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.560
They all say
I'm in perfect health.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.000
I'll call you back.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.120
- What's going on?
- Sorry for the intrusion.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.120
My security detail
is nothing if not thorough.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.720
They have to be.
The administration has enemies

15:32.800 --> 15:35.360
- everywhere these days.
- What are you doing here, Ms. Parrish?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.520
I wanted to have
a word with you in private.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.600
Gentlemen...

15:41.560 --> 15:43.800
Gentlemen, agent Baldwin and I
need the room.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.080
Thank you.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.120
Damn it, this is my house...

15:47.200 --> 15:49.560
I'm going to pay you
the respect of being frank.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.760
I was a little concerned
with your...

15:51.880 --> 15:54.160
outburst in Ms. Doyle's office
this morning.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.480
Are you quite sure you're up to the job
of tracking down Richard Tyler?

15:57.560 --> 15:59.640
- I'm fine.
- That's good to hear.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.920
This might surprise you,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.680
but I think I have an idea
of what you're going through.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.440
Right after I took this job,

16:07.760 --> 16:11.040
I felt like I was on the verge
of a breakdown myself.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.360
I was overwhelmed at work,
and I was...

16:14.720 --> 16:18.080
having these strange moments
where I was seeing things.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.280
It was almost like
I wasn't myself.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.000
Like... someone else
was in my head.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.440
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.840
I think I do.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.360
Let me ask you something,
Ms. Parrish.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.800
If I look behind your left ear,
would I find a mark there?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.280
A mark?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.040
You mean like a mole?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.200
That's hard to say.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.440
Once you turn 40,

16:39.800 --> 16:41.480
your skin changes all the time.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.480
I remember how nervous I was
in those days.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.720
I thought I was going to
lose myself forever.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.520
I fought it.
My God, how I fought it.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.840
And then one day,

16:52.160 --> 16:54.200
I just couldn't fight it
anymore.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.920
I gave in.
I accepted my situation.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.480
And you know what?

17:00.400 --> 17:03.440
Things have been
much better for me since then.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.680
I'm happier.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.319
My friends tell me
that I'm like a new person.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.839
You should relax, Tom.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.599
Whatever you're going through,

17:13.960 --> 17:14.920
just...

17:15.720 --> 17:16.680
let it happen.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.720
You'll feel better.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.960
I promise.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.040
You're saying Rebecca Parrish
is one of these people?

17:30.160 --> 17:32.160
- She's marked?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.640
She never came out
and said it.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.480
But you haven't had
any more hallucinations,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.880
so, maybe she was talking
about something else.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
What do you think?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.000
I think it's crazy,

17:43.320 --> 17:45.480
and I doubt we'll be able
to prove any of this, but...

17:45.560 --> 17:47.680
I have to go with Tom.
I think that there's a very good chance

17:47.800 --> 17:49.680
the director of national
intelligence is marked.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.760
We're going to have to be very careful
with how we proceed.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.120
NTAC would be looking for
Richard Tyler no matter what,

17:57.200 --> 17:58.520
so we'll keep doing that.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.120
I'm passing the case over
to Garrity and Ashmore.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.400
Tom, you're taking
a personal day tomorrow.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.280
Diana and I
will keep an eye on you.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.880
We'll watch over you
in shifts.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.080
I'm sorry, Shawn,
are you really asking me

18:11.160 --> 18:12.760
to tell people
not to take promicin?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.200
Only for a few months.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.800
Jordan, I know that
we have had our differences in the past,

18:16.920 --> 18:18.960
but this is good for both of us.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.640
All we have to do is be patient.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.000
It's not the need for patience
that concerns me.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.960
It's the worldwide implications
of this test.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.880
Shawn, there would be millions of people
with abilities

18:27.960 --> 18:29.840
and millions without any chance
of having them.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.200
Yes, but they would be alive.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.520
And living in a world
with two classes of human being.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.720
Positives and negatives
cannot live side by side.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.160
Those without abilities
will tear down the ones who have them.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.840
Or, the positives will simply
use their powers

18:45.920 --> 18:47.400
to rid themselves
of the negatives.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.840
Inquisition, or holocaust.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.800
Either way, it's a recipe
for hell on earth.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.600
What's your alternative?
Do you really want

18:52.680 --> 18:54.440
- the entire world to take promicin?
- Yes.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.600
Yes, I do. It's what I've always said
has to happen.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.480
Half of the planet will die!

18:59.280 --> 19:01.960
- You're talking about mass suicide!
- I am talking...

19:02.440 --> 19:05.080
about a single generation
of sacrifice.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.800
And at the end of it,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.280
a more fully-evolved species.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.880
All of our failings
as human beings

19:15.000 --> 19:16.840
will be addressed
when we are all gifted.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.160
I am not making
any announcement.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.200
And no one who cares about
what's right for the world would.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
Somebody got so big!

19:34.040 --> 19:35.480
Oh, she got heavy, too.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.120
Yeah.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.520
- Just one, just one.
- I'm going to go play.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.960
All right, go play.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.800
She seems so happy.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.840
Aren't toddlers
supposed to be moody?

19:47.280 --> 19:50.120
Oh, Isabelle's had her moments,
believe me.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.080
Oh, I'm sure she has.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.000
Ever since I got back,
I've been...

19:55.680 --> 19:57.720
thinking about what it must
have been like for you,

19:57.840 --> 19:59.280
raising her on your own.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.360
You know, neither of
us asked to be parents,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.160
not that it makes it any less
wonderful, but still...

20:05.680 --> 20:07.040
It just kind of happened.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.240
But you've always been
there for her,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.560
even while I was gone.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.280
You're a great father, Richard.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.800
You can tell
just by looking at her.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.440
<i>I'm definitely using my ability
on Richard Tyler.</i>

20:30.160 --> 20:31.280
<i>He's seeing his dead wife,</i>

20:31.440 --> 20:33.160
but I have no idea
if they're talking about

20:33.240 --> 20:34.560
what he did to his daughter.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.000
I just make him see her.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.960
Everything they talk
about comes from him.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.400
Allright, keep at it.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.120
We don't have any other
options at this point.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.960
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.560
Look, I know you're tired,

20:48.640 --> 20:50.360
but this is very important.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.600
I won't forget
what you did for me.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.200
- Can I get a coffee or something?
- Absolutely.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.440
Absolutely.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.080
It's working.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.400
We just need more time.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.400
If you know where Isabelle is,
just tell me. I can help her myself.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.200
Didn't really work out so well
the last time you tried it, did it?

21:20.360 --> 21:21.600
It's too soon for that.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.040
Richard's not ready to give her up yet.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.600
This is just the first
part of a plan to get her back.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.080
When we're ready for the next part,
I'll let you know.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.080
Or you can tell me now.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.440
Did you know he was involved
with her grandmother?

21:38.120 --> 21:40.240
Why do you think
we picked these two?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.160
After we send them back
to their time,

21:44.280 --> 21:45.560
they'll find each other.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.280
They'll form a bond.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.640
It's done.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.320
She's pregnant.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.160
Honey...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.000
Honey, Meghan.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.040
Honey, wake up.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.440
I had the dream again.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.480
Of course you did, Tom.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.480
You're becoming your new self.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.080
You're one of us now.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.680
Welcome aboard.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.240
Did you have another dream?

22:55.560 --> 22:57.360
No, I slept like a baby, actually.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.320
I feel great.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.560
Forgot how much I hate it here.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.760
There's so much noise
in this time period.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.800
So many people.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.640
Look at them.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.400
They have no idea what's coming.

23:20.040 --> 23:24.040
They just move from pointless
errand to pointless errand.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.600
It's disgusting.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.360
I'd think you'd be
glad just to be alive.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.040
You were given a chance
to continue your work.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.520
The work that failed so badly?

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
The work that got
my previous host killed?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.400
Don't blame your shortcomings
on Matthew Ross.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.000
We are our hosts.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.920
Your inability to harness
Isabelle Tyler was your failure.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.200
I'll do better this time.

23:44.360 --> 23:45.800
You need to get back to work.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.360
Convince them to return
you to active duty.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.080
I'll pull some strings if I have to,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.080
but it's better if you
got it done on your own.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.040
- And after I'm  there?
- That's the easy part.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.960
Do what Tom Baldwin would do.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.480
Find Isabelle Tyler.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.880
I'll be in touch.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.080
Richard, come play.

24:12.000 --> 24:12.960
I can't.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.000
Lily, I have to tell you something.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.840
What is it, sweetheart?

24:30.760 --> 24:31.800
I lied to you.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.600
That picture you saw.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.080
The pretty girl.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.280
That was Isabelle.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.360
My god, Richard. I had no idea
things had gotten so bad.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.440
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but I need you to understand.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.520
I did it for our daughter.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.800
Why didn't you tell
me the truth right away?

25:06.720 --> 25:07.800
I've been happy,

25:09.760 --> 25:11.160
being with you the last few days.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.880
You don't know how long it's been
since I've felt that way.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.320
A good father will
do anything for his child,

25:22.560 --> 25:23.880
and you're a good father.

25:26.280 --> 25:29.120
But, Richard,
you took away her life.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.600
The good and the bad.
You erased everything she was,

25:33.720 --> 25:35.440
everything she could have been.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.480
I knew I was wrong
after I did it to her, but...

25:42.320 --> 25:44.480
Other people told me as much,
but I didn't listen.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.160
I guess the only person
I could listen to was you.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.040
Daddy...

26:03.840 --> 26:05.000
I feel real.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.160
We're talking.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.200
- I've held Isabelle.
- No, you haven't.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.600
My ability makes it seem
like you have.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.400
I don't know if I'm  seeing you
because I want to,

26:17.800 --> 26:19.440
or if someone conjured you up for me.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.080
I don't know, Richard.
I don't know how I got here,

26:26.240 --> 26:27.680
but maybe it doesn't matter.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.480
I don't think I'm going
to be here much longer.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.880
But if I have to go,

26:56.920 --> 26:58.360
will you just hold me?

27:05.080 --> 27:06.480
I love you, Richard.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.600
I'm not saying we don't have to worry,

28:00.720 --> 28:02.080
but nothing happened last night,

28:02.200 --> 28:03.800
and this morning, Tom said he felt fine.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.240
He said he didn't
want me to come over,

28:05.360 --> 28:06.440
but where is he?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.240
Because Tom is always
here at the crack of dawn.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.120
Hey, what's up with Tom?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.320
He just dragged Marco
out of his office.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.480
I think Baldwin's
gone nuts or something.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.200
Your mind is no match
for the power of my mind.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.840
You are now under my control.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.960
My mind is no match
for the power of your mind.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.000
I am now under your control.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.440
Total control.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.160
Total control.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.360
You should see their faces.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.640
Sorry, Di, we were just trying
to ease the tension a little bit,

28:43.760 --> 28:45.360
- that's all.
- You idiots!

28:45.480 --> 28:47.680
Marco, you're fired.
You too, Garrity.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.840
- Come on, that was classic!
- You can't fire this.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.680
Go back to your office
and solve something.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.520
- Hey, come on...
- Quick.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.120
I'm sorry.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.160
Good work.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.360
No humor.
No humor in this room.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.640
What?
Ah, you know what?

29:04.760 --> 29:05.960
Seriously, look,

29:06.280 --> 29:07.480
I'd like to thank you both

29:07.560 --> 29:09.240
for helping me get through
these past few days,

29:09.760 --> 29:12.040
but I had a great night's sleep.
I feel...

29:12.240 --> 29:14.880
better, and, look
I really hope this is all over.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.240
If I have any more flashes,
I'll tell you right away,

29:18.360 --> 29:21.120
but in the meantime,
I'd really like to get back to work.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.160
What about Rebecca Parrish?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.280
I think we need to keep an eye on her.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.400
Her visit to my place was...
definitely weird.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.880
but maybe you were right.
Maybe the whole thing

29:32.000 --> 29:33.760
was her bizarre version
of a pep talk.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.680
Look, whatever it is,

29:36.040 --> 29:37.920
I don't have to trust her
to do my job.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.920
And I really want to do my job.

29:43.800 --> 29:44.840
All right,

29:45.360 --> 29:47.120
but I'll be watching you, okay?

29:47.240 --> 29:49.640
Any more attempts at mind control
Baldwin, and you're out.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.200
That wasn't funny.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.320
I have a very simple message

29:57.440 --> 29:59.520
for anyone who's thinking
about taking the shot.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.720
Wait.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.960
In a few months, the research
that I'm funding will be complete

30:05.080 --> 30:07.040
and 50-50 will be a thing of the past.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.880
We will have a very simple test

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
that can tell you whether
or not you'll survive the shot,

30:11.120 --> 30:12.920
and no one ever has to risk dying again.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.680
What about Jordan Collier?
Is he in favor of this?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.440
You'd have to ask him that, Paul,

30:17.840 --> 30:20.640
but we're talking about preventing
thousands of needless deaths here.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.480
I don't see how anyone
could think that's a bad thing.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.720
You did this to your own child.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.800
I'm disappointed in you, Richard.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.320
You told me you wanted
to use that water I gave you

30:33.440 --> 30:34.920
to help an old army buddy.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.520
I know it was wrong.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.560
But you never would
have gave me what I needed

30:40.680 --> 30:43.360
- if you knew what I had in mind.
- Oh, you're right about that.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.080
These abilities we have,

30:45.360 --> 30:47.000
they are a gift from god,

30:47.120 --> 30:50.040
and we need to treat them
with respect.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.880
I know that,

30:52.120 --> 30:53.280
and that's why I'm here.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.600
I'm hoping you can set things right.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.640
Cora, please.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.360
I need your help.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.960
I'll see what I can do.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.240
Byron, you gotta wake up.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.920
Byron...
Isabelle needs you.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.080
- Come on...
- Let him sleep.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.000
He did what he needed to do.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.120
Does that mean Isabelle's okay?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.560
Not exactly,

31:30.680 --> 31:32.040
but we're getting close.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.800
I need you to call your father.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.560
Call my father? Why?

31:37.680 --> 31:39.760
You're going to have
to tell him where Isabelle is.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.360
You want me to betray
her to the government?

31:44.560 --> 31:46.200
If you know where she is, tell me.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.360
- I'll go there myself.
- This is how it has to be.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.200
I promise you, Kyle,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.640
if you do exactly what I say,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.600
Isabelle will not wind up in jail.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.200
Think of everything we've done, Kyle.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.240
All that we've accomplished together.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.080
Are you really going
to start doubting me now?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.000
Did it work?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.440
Daddy...

32:33.920 --> 32:35.040
Are you going out?

32:36.760 --> 32:39.760
We had a tip on the Tyler case.
Someone called in from Promise City,

32:39.880 --> 32:41.600
gave us the name
and address of a 4400

32:41.680 --> 32:44.000
that Richard claimed
he'd been in contact with.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.680
It was anonymous,
probably nothing.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.560
You had the appointment
at Maia's school.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.120
I figured I'd run it
down while you were out.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.560
I'm back, so I'll go with you.
I'll just get my jacket.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.640
Okay, great.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.080
Did you see that?

33:13.600 --> 33:14.720
The curtain just moved.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.920
Well, so someone knows we're here.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.360
That tip of yours said this lady's
just an associate of Tyler's, right?

33:20.560 --> 33:21.920
Yeah, but we'd better play it safe.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.440
Knock on the door.
I'm gonna head around back,

33:23.560 --> 33:25.240
make sure no one
tries to flee the scene.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.720
Richard, a car just pulled up outside.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.920
Some people are coming.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.160
Isabelle,
get down to the basement.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.960
If you hear any kind of struggle,
run out the back, understand?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.160
Answer the door if they knock.
See if you can get rid of them.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.400
Cora Tomkins?

33:52.600 --> 33:54.960
Hi. I'm Diana Skouris.
I'm from NTAC.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.960
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Richard Tyler.

33:58.840 --> 33:59.960
Richard Tyler?

34:01.520 --> 34:03.240
I haven't seen him since quarantine.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.719
Do you mind if I come in?

34:11.679 --> 34:14.760
So Richard hasn't tried
to get in touch with you at all?

34:14.880 --> 34:17.280
No phone calls? No emails?

34:17.400 --> 34:19.880
No, but I keep
pretty much to myself.

34:20.000 --> 34:20.960
Right.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.159
Oh, I'm  sorry. I didn't realize
I was interrupting something.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.239
- You have company.
- No, no.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.440
Pardon my mess.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.600
I'm not too good about
cleaning up after myself.

34:31.719 --> 34:34.080
Like I say,
I knew the man in quarantine,

34:34.199 --> 34:37.199
but I don't really keep in touch
with many of the 4400s.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.800
- You people just don't quit.
- Don't move.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.800
Are you okay?

35:51.080 --> 35:52.440
What have you done to them?

36:06.520 --> 36:07.680
Honey...

36:09.360 --> 36:10.480
Are you okay?

36:13.600 --> 36:14.640
Yeah, I think so.

36:14.920 --> 36:15.920
I'm sorry. I went around back,

36:16.040 --> 36:17.400
and Isabelle was already
halfway down the alley

36:17.520 --> 36:19.240
when I got out there.
I was going to chase her,

36:19.360 --> 36:21.240
but I came back when
I heard the gunshot.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.560
Where is she now?

36:24.040 --> 36:25.720
I don't know, Diana,
she got away.

36:33.340 --> 36:34.460
Good job, guys.

36:44.260 --> 36:47.220
Today, agent Baldwin
and agent Skouris

36:47.340 --> 36:50.740
provided a textbook example
of what we need to win this fight.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.540
Initiative, savvy,

36:52.660 --> 36:54.300
and exceptional teamwork.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.580
The apprehension of Richard Tyler

36:56.700 --> 36:58.380
is a huge win for us,

36:58.820 --> 37:00.620
a reminder to everyone

37:00.740 --> 37:04.380
that the rule of law still prevails
in this country.

37:04.580 --> 37:05.860
Make no mistake,

37:06.220 --> 37:07.740
there's lots more to be done,

37:07.860 --> 37:08.980
but today....

37:09.700 --> 37:10.900
Today we won.

37:20.460 --> 37:21.460
Nice speech.

37:21.580 --> 37:24.820
Yeah, exactly what Parrish
would say if she were marked.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.700
Then again, it's exactly what Parrish
would say if she wasn't marked.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.100
I know, either way,
she won today.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.340
Nice work, you guys.
I gotta go make nice.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.620
Hey, you...

37:37.940 --> 37:39.580
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.580
Sure?

37:47.340 --> 37:49.020
We really got lucky today,

37:49.700 --> 37:51.660
just finding Richard in that house.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.340
It's a good thing you got that tip.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.500
Yeah, well, it has to work
out for us sometimes, doesn't it?

38:20.980 --> 38:22.740
This is not how this
was supposed to end!

38:22.860 --> 38:24.660
Richard is in prison!
It's all over the news!

38:24.780 --> 38:27.220
Isabelle's on the run.
Government's looking for her.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.820
You said that she'd be okay.
You lied to me!

38:29.940 --> 38:32.020
I promised you she
wouldn't end up in jail.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.100
- She's not in jail.
- Yeah, and she's not safe, either.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.180
- This is not what I wanted...
- This isn't about what you want, Kyle!

38:37.340 --> 38:39.140
It's about what has to happen!

38:40.860 --> 38:42.620
I'm not your sidekick.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.580
I'm not here to run errands for you.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.340
I'm here to tell you
what the movement needs,

38:46.460 --> 38:48.660
and right now,
it needs for you to be strong,

38:48.820 --> 38:50.540
because the next thing you have to do,

38:50.860 --> 38:53.300
trust me,
it's not gonna be easy for you.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.900
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin Shawn?

38:55.980 --> 38:57.740
The work he's doing
with that scientist

38:57.820 --> 38:59.780
is threatening the entire movement.

38:59.940 --> 39:00.940
Collier knows about it,

39:01.060 --> 39:02.820
but he's too afraid
to get his hands dirty.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.220
He shouldn't have
to get his hands dirty.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.340
That's what he has people like you for.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.180
People like me?

39:10.660 --> 39:11.940
What do you want me to do?

39:12.900 --> 39:15.420
Shawn Farrell has to be stopped.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.660
Don't worry. You're safe.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.420
- Where am I?
- You're at my house.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.180
I gave you a tranquilizer,
then I brought you here.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.620
- Where's my father?
- We put him on the inhibitor.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.140
He's in prison.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.860
He's gonna be there
for a very long time.

39:52.980 --> 39:54.180
He didn't do anything wrong.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.940
He was just trying to help me.

39:56.540 --> 39:58.060
Isabelle, it's okay. It's okay.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.220
There's a way to get him out.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.780
I know people
who could make it happen.

40:01.900 --> 40:02.980
It would be easy.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.420
There's just one thing.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.060
You...

40:11.100 --> 40:12.540
have to take your abilities back.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.700
Then, you can bring
Jordan Collier to me.
