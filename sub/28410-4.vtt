10:18.326 --> 10:20.870
Just like you...

10:20.953 --> 10:23.497
will want to be pardoned.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.710
Meet Sergeant Yuka Mongoyak,

10:27.793 --> 10:29.253
a woman with a knack

10:29.337 --> 10:32.214
for detecting
the most subtle of mistruths.

10:32.298 --> 10:36.218
On this night, a night
of the most powerful of myths,

10:36.302 --> 10:39.055
that skill will be tested
like never before.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.057
She's about to learn

10:41.140 --> 10:43.351
that the truth can take
many different forms,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.561
depending on how you look at it.

10:45.644 --> 10:49.732
Because tonight,
Sergeant Yuka's vantage point

10:49.815 --> 10:51.984
is at the very heart...

10:52.068 --> 10:54.737

{\an8}and I hate to be

12:39.842 --> 12:43.345
{\an8}I actually came

12:43.429 --> 12:44.847
{\an7}there's no workshop
up there.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.057
{\an8}Just a bunch of snow.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.396
{\an7}Yeah, I just...
flew over it

{\an8}Are you shittin' me?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.441
{\an8}I mean, they-they've
heard about this?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.527
{\an8}They've heard about me
all the way up here?

13:39.610 --> 13:41.070
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.281

13:44.365 --> 13:47.201
about Captain Lane Pendleton's
Christmas Eve pardons.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.581
That to be here in Iglaak
on Christmas Eve sits...

13:52.665 --> 13:56.085
high on any extreme
tourist bucket list.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.295
Ride a train

14:05.678 --> 14:07.930
on Christmas Eve in Iglaak,

14:08.013 --> 14:09.098
{\an1}Alaska.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.307
(chuckles)

14:10.391 --> 14:12.101
I did not realize.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.727
I could see it, though.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.646
{\an5}I could.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.646
Would that
mean, um...

14:15.729 --> 14:18.607
uh, Captain Pendleton,
would you...

14:18.691 --> 14:20.985
would you pardon me tonight?

14:22.027 --> 14:23.904
Oh, yeah, uh...

14:23.988 --> 14:25.948
Well, let me think about that

14:26.031 --> 14:27.783
{\an3}one, uh...

14:27.866 --> 14:29.952
{\an3}Hmm...
(chuckles)

14:30.035 --> 14:31.912
{\an3}Have you committed
any crime?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.791

to come here.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.460
{\an4}(laughs)

14:35.874 --> 14:38.460
{\an3}Y-You know, you said
you got a YouTube.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.130
{\an3}Maybe you can video
me-me pardon you,

14:41.213 --> 14:44.300
{\an5}and put it on the
show, if you want.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.300
Yeah. Absolutely.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.843
You know what, I'll video it...

14:49.680 --> 14:51.724
(quietly):
Just a phone.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.184
{\an1}I'll throw it up
online,

14:54.268 --> 14:56.020
{\an1}and that way
all the extreme tourists

14:56.103 --> 14:58.314
can see for themselves
just how truly charming

14:58.397 --> 15:00.774
{\an5}you and this town are.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.774
Well, it's a good town.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.985
{\an4}(chuckles)
If you do this
tonight, Captain,

15:03.068 --> 15:06.322
there'll be a lot more people
just like me here next year.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.533
Yeah, you know that-that show
<i>Alaskan Troopers</i> on Nat Geo,

15:09.617 --> 15:11.368
{\an3}they just totally
blew us off.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.996
{\an3}I think it's just 'cause the
Air Force base up the road

15:14.079 --> 15:15.664
{\an3}doesn't like people
poking around.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.374
What kind of phone is this?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.335
Oh, Jesus, look
at that thing.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.003
Who makes that?

15:21.086 --> 15:23.005
It's a Russian design.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.009
It's Russian-made?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
The Russians don't

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
<i>make</i> anything.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.555
{\an5}They steal everything.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.555
Oh, no, no,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.933
{\an1}that actually already has
an 8K video resolution.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.560
It's a beta, but...

15:36.644 --> 15:38.854
I'm sure if I said it was
for Captain Pendleton,

15:38.937 --> 15:40.856
I could get you one.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.858
{\an3}Well, they're just across
our front yard there,

15:42.941 --> 15:45.486
{\an5}across the Chukchi
Sea, the Russians.

15:42.941 --> 15:45.486
{\an1}I know.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.571
They know all about you.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.577
{\an3}All right, well, doesn't look
like it's gonna be Jack's night,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.871
{\an3}so give him his phone
back, unlock him.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.748
I gotta pardon this guy.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.042
Captain.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.920
(quietly): We should run
a 10-29 active warrants search.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.798
Now? There's not gonna be
anybody there tonight.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.860
from Moscow to Vladivostok.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.112
And along that ride,

20:39.196 --> 20:41.240
so many people came up to me

20:41.323 --> 20:45.494
to ask me about that tough
American sheriff in Iglaak

20:47.454 --> 20:49.331
{\an5}(laughter, lively chatter)

20:47.454 --> 20:49.331
Now, they even said

20:49.414 --> 20:51.667
{\an3}that the North Koreans
told the Russians

20:51.750 --> 20:54.711
that if they ever were
gonna attack the United States,

20:54.795 --> 20:57.798
that they'd have to go
around Captain Pendleton

20:57.881 --> 21:00.842

{\an1}What the hell
are you talking about?

29:18.715 --> 29:20.842
{\an1}That's not true.
That's not even true.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.845
And, Mr. Colchack, your
bid on the construction

29:23.928 --> 29:25.513
of the airfield runway
out beyond the lagoon

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
was the lowest
of all three bidders.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.311
You piece of shit.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.688
{\an4}I knew it.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.688
Mayor Matheson over here

29:33.771 --> 29:35.732
awarded the project
to the Russian company

29:35.815 --> 29:38.234
{\an5}across the Bering Strait.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.234
That has not been determined.

about this asshole!

29:40.111 --> 29:41.696
How could you reelect him?

29:41.779 --> 29:44.365
Oh, like you didn't go down
on all the Air Force brass

29:44.449 --> 29:46.868
{\an3}to get that bid for the cargo
loading apron at the base,

29:46.951 --> 29:49.162
{\an5}Buzzy.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.162
Going down on?

29:49.245 --> 29:50.497
{\an1}Now,<i> that's</i> something
you know about.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.332
{\an5}Hang on to this, honey!

29:50.580 --> 29:52.332
Oh, you wish, bitch!

29:52.415 --> 29:53.875

29:52.415 --> 29:53.875

(Rita and Dottie grunting)

29:55.126 --> 29:56.878
For crying out loud!

29:56.961 --> 29:58.713
Hey, don't you touch me!

{\an4}The party's over,
everybody. Come on.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.018
Break it up.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.270
{\an1}Grab your coats
and get your drunk heinies

30:14.354 --> 30:17.690
{\an3}out of here.
Everybody.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.743

{\an3}You did know right where to
go with Matheson and Colchack

31:28.261 --> 31:30.179
to set them off.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.265
How?

31:32.348 --> 31:34.934
Well, they've hated each other

31:35.018 --> 31:37.270
ever since Buzz tried
to feel up Dottie Matheson

31:37.353 --> 31:39.314
ten years ago
at this very party.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.857
That is
an unsubstantiated rumor,

31:40.940 --> 31:42.984
and how did you know that?!

31:43.067 --> 31:44.986
{\an3}How's he know that?
What, are you...

31:45.069 --> 31:47.989
What are you,
friend? Huh?

31:48.781 --> 31:51.451
{\an3}You a Russian spy?
Man in Black?

31:51.534 --> 31:52.910
If you're Santa Claus,

31:52.994 --> 31:54.704
you're a little late
delivering your toys.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.623
(sighs)

31:56.706 --> 31:58.499
I'm Special Agent Douglas Heyes

31:58.583 --> 32:00.668
from the Anchorage field office.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.003
Iglaak is a small town,

32:02.086 --> 32:03.796
{\an1}but there exists
widespread corruption

32:03.880 --> 32:06.674
{\an1}that could affect the security
of the United States of America.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.844
{\an1}You have any
Bureau identification?

32:09.927 --> 32:13.806
Undercover special agents
don't have I.D., Sergeant.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.934
Who's under investigation?

32:22.148 --> 32:25.777
I'll tell you
who's under investigation.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.822
{\an3}You are.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.205
{\an3}And you're going right
back into that cell

32:37.288 --> 32:41.334
until we can confirm with
the Bureau in Anchorage.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.232
{\an3}JACK:
Hey. Yo.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.025
What's the story with my pie?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.735
Yo, Captain,
I'm supposed to be getting

33:07.819 --> 33:09.737
{\an3}some pie.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.407
I know the reasons
you don't trust me.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.076
{\an1}But we'll work well together
once Captain Pendleton's removed

33:15.159 --> 33:17.078
and you replace him.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.996
When you're the lead sled dog.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.790
Jack, you're pardoned.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.959
{\an3}Hell no.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.378
It's 30 below,
I-I'm too drunk to drive,

33:25.461 --> 33:28.172

What the actual what?

34:37.199 --> 34:38.409
Did you see that?!

34:39.911 --> 34:42.663
{\an5}Get those guns off me.

JACK: I saw something.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.501
Right?

34:46.583 --> 34:49.045
{\an3}Yeah, he looked like
a fucking snail.

34:49.128 --> 34:52.005
He had antennae
coming out his h-head.

34:52.089 --> 34:53.507
(chuckles softly)

34:53.591 --> 34:55.510
Yuka, you're awfully quiet.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.887
{\an5}What do you believe?

34:55.592 --> 34:57.887
{\an3}PENDLETON:
She saw it.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.680

{\an3}She may not be saying
anything, but she saw it!

35:01.766 --> 35:04.227
{\an1}No one saw anything
because that's insane.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.854
It's probably shadows from
your flashlights or something.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.315
Antennae? (chuckles)

35:09.398 --> 35:11.609
You two are tripping
on cheese log.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.240
Take off the hat.

35:29.085 --> 35:33.047
Now, I've been nothing
but nice to you.

35:33.130 --> 35:36.134
Nothing but nice.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.385
So, you need to consider

35:37.468 --> 35:40.054
if it's worth
the irreversible remorse

35:40.137 --> 35:42.723
to further address me...

35:48.980 --> 35:52.149
...with such rude intentions.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.408
Especially when I know things...

36:00.491 --> 36:03.411
about you, Captain Pendleton.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.330
{\an3}All you need to know is I got
you locked up in my jail.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.915
And to be exact,

36:07.999 --> 36:10.293
this jail
is officially considered

36:10.376 --> 36:12.420
Alaska State Trooper Post 151.

36:12.503 --> 36:16.090
{\an1}What's the primary purpose
of Post 151?

36:16.173 --> 36:17.758
To serve the public good.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.260
By the support and protection

36:19.343 --> 36:21.429
of an acknowledged
temporary vulnerability

36:21.512 --> 36:24.765
outside of the Cheney Air Force
Listening Installation.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.226
It's the point at which the
Air Force facilities' power grid

36:27.310 --> 36:29.937
connects and is shared
with the town of Iglaak's

36:30.021 --> 36:31.480
{\an5}older existing grid.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.480
PENDLETON: Okay.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.942
{\an5}That's enough.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.942
{\an1}There's a camouflage shed
somewhere nearby

36:35.026 --> 36:37.278
that houses the connection point
between the Air Force base

36:37.361 --> 36:38.946
and the town's power grid.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.782
{\an3}He's experiencing a mental
breakdown of some kind.

36:41.866 --> 36:42.992
(chuckles softly)

36:43.075 --> 36:45.494
So, if a hostile force
were to invade,

36:45.578 --> 36:47.496
they'd just have to destroy

36:47.580 --> 36:49.123
{\an5}that one shed?

36:47.580 --> 36:49.123
{\an3}PENDLETON:
That location

36:49.206 --> 36:51.083
is classified information.

36:51.167 --> 36:54.962
Classified
is actually the most...

36:55.046 --> 36:58.299
lucrative type of information.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.427
{\an1}Isn't it,
Captain Lane Pendleton?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.972
Oh.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.599
That's right, she doesn't know.

37:06.682 --> 37:07.975
(chuckles)

37:08.059 --> 37:10.436
{\an1}Captain Pendleton
has sold the information

37:10.519 --> 37:13.105
to our neighbors
across the Chukchi Sea.

37:13.189 --> 37:13.981
The Russians.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.650
Nothing you've said
has been the truth.

37:15.733 --> 37:16.817
Oh, you want the truth?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.778
Oh, you can't handle the truth.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.488
{\an1}(laughs)

37:20.571 --> 37:22.490
I'm sure anyone can understand
the captain's motivation

37:22.573 --> 37:24.325
{\an5}for such corruption.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.325
{\an3}PENDLETON:
There is no motivation

37:24.408 --> 37:25.952
{\an3}'cause there has
been no corruption.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.286
{\an1}20 years

37:27.370 --> 37:29.163
as the big cheese
in Iglaak, Alaska.

37:29.246 --> 37:31.499
{\an1}It's not
a location, nor is

37:31.582 --> 37:33.960
Alaska State Trooper
an occupation,

37:34.043 --> 37:36.504
where anyone can make
any real money

37:36.587 --> 37:38.673
or actually make any real impact
on the world.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.007
You shut your mouth.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.635
Especially someone like you,
Lane Pendleton,

37:42.718 --> 37:43.636
would have made
a great impact.

37:43.719 --> 37:44.845
You shut your mouth.

37:44.929 --> 37:45.930
The best impact.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.186
I'm gonna put a hole
in this insect.

37:52.269 --> 37:55.564
But you gave up on that idea.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.191
{\an1}You gave up on yourself,
you just...

37:57.274 --> 37:58.484
gave up.

37:58.567 --> 38:01.821
I never gave up on anything.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.408
I'm Agent Marius Constant
from the National

38:05.491 --> 38:07.034
{\an1}Reconnaissance
Office.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.537
{\an1}Captain will save a lot
of money and headache

38:09.620 --> 38:11.247
{\an1}and maybe lives
if he just confesses

38:11.330 --> 38:13.874
{\an1}that he told the Russians
about the location of the shed.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.668
{\an3}He's lying!

38:15.751 --> 38:17.336
At this very minute,

38:17.420 --> 38:19.505
Russian Spetsnaz forces
are on their way to sabotage

38:19.588 --> 38:21.757
what I know is the location

38:21.841 --> 38:22.758
of the shed.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.593
{\an1}Thing is,

38:24.677 --> 38:26.721
my people are going
to intercept them.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.228
{\an1}I'm going there
right now,

38:34.311 --> 38:36.939
{\an1}to warn the Americans
or the Russians.

38:40.317 --> 38:42.403
He stays here.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.782
(door opens)

38:49.994 --> 38:51.412
(door slams)

38:54.415 --> 38:56.417
Mm.
(exhales, chuckles)

38:56.500 --> 38:58.085
I thought he'd never leave.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.296
Now we can talk.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.923
So, I'm just trying to prove
to everybody here

39:03.007 --> 39:05.551
what you've known
for all these years,

39:05.634 --> 39:08.179
{\an1}that he doesn't care
about this area,

39:08.262 --> 39:10.598
{\an1}this land,
or your people.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.016
That he's a liar.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.637
I'll put in
a good word.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.847
You'll be running this place.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.348
But working for us.

40:34.431 --> 40:36.392
Captain Pendleton, this is Post.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.852
{\an3}10-19.
Return to base.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.145
10-39. Urgent.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.563
10-39. Urgent.

40:45.442 --> 40:47.027
{\an3}Pendleton,
can you hear me?

40:47.111 --> 40:48.320
(static)

40:48.404 --> 40:49.697
Our intelligence indicated

40:49.780 --> 40:51.532
that you would be vulnerable
to attack,

40:51.615 --> 40:54.160
somewhere in this vicinity,

40:54.243 --> 40:55.661
on this day.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.539
{\an1}So, in order to ensure
the success of the invasion,

40:58.622 --> 41:01.167
{\an1}Pendleton needed to lead us
to the power source

41:01.250 --> 41:03.544
{\an1}of the Air Force
early discrimination system

41:03.627 --> 41:05.379
in order to remove it.

41:05.462 --> 41:07.006
{\an1}And you let
Pendleton go.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.341
{\an1}Is it because maybe you thought
it'd get rid of him

41:09.425 --> 41:11.469
or give you his job or both?

41:11.552 --> 41:13.345
{\an1}You'll never have
to worry

41:13.429 --> 41:14.889
about Captain Pendleton again.

41:14.972 --> 41:18.392
Or, uh, Christmas,
for that matter.

41:18.475 --> 41:21.520
{\an1}(chuckles)
What's with the gun, Yuka?

41:21.604 --> 41:24.565
I mean, why do you want
to kill me?

41:24.648 --> 41:26.734
You knew what I was.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.736
I did nothing but lie to you.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.404
Only,

41:30.487 --> 41:33.574
once I said something
that might benefit you,

41:33.657 --> 41:35.993
you chose to ignore it.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.412
See, that's
not a lie.

41:38.495 --> 41:41.624
{\an1}You willingly accepted
the lie.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.084
That's worse.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.085
Now it's too late.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.340
(panting)

41:57.348 --> 41:59.016
No.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.685
It's not too late.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.398
Just arrived at the mesosphere.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.445
Captain Pendleton, respond!

42:11.528 --> 42:13.447
Do not go to the shed!

42:16.825 --> 42:19.787
All units respond.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.540
Does anyone have a 20
on Captain Pendleton?

42:23.624 --> 42:26.126
{\an5}Captain Pendleton,
this is Post. 10-19.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.922
{\an5}Repeat, 10-19.
Do not go to the shed.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.549
Ah, fuck!

42:41.058 --> 42:42.977
{\an1}Hey, bro.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.979
You know, if you could, uh,

42:45.062 --> 42:49.733
you know, like, use your magic
and open my cell, too...

43:05.124 --> 43:06.667
Whoa.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.836
That's a cool trick, man.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.671

43:28.939 --> 43:31.066
Yeah. A while ago,
I saw him going south on Nixon,

43:31.150 --> 43:32.401
but, just now,

43:32.484 --> 43:34.028
{\an3}he tore off toward
County Highway.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.697
{\an5}No! Get off me!

43:34.111 --> 43:36.697
