00:37.702 --> 00:41.138
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

00:41.205 --> 00:44.368
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

00:45.510 --> 00:50.072
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

00:59.924 --> 01:05.624
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

01:05.696 --> 01:09.223
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.463
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

01:12.537 --> 01:14.835
Enough talk. Let's fight!

01:14.906 --> 01:16.339
Shashabooey!

01:19.310 --> 01:21.141
He was so deadly in fact,

01:21.212 --> 01:24.909
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

01:24.982 --> 01:27.177
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

01:27.251 --> 01:30.015
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

01:30.855 --> 01:33.255
There is no charge for awesomeness.

01:33.324 --> 01:35.952
Or attractiveness.

01:36.027 --> 01:37.289
Kablooey!

01:37.361 --> 01:40.091
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

01:40.164 --> 01:43.031
They were no match for his bodacity!

01:55.546 --> 02:00.210
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

02:01.085 --> 02:03.781
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

02:03.855 --> 02:06.085
the Furious Five,

02:06.157 --> 02:09.092
bowed in respect
to this great master.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.991
We should hang out.

02:11.062 --> 02:12.188
Agreed.

02:15.032 --> 02:17.193
But hanging out would have to wait.

02:17.268 --> 02:21.705
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

02:21.772 --> 02:24.570
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

02:24.809 --> 02:26.401
Po! Get up!

02:26.477 --> 02:28.240
You'll be later for work!

02:28.312 --> 02:29.574
What?

02:36.087 --> 02:38.351
Po! Get up!

02:53.704 --> 02:57.162
Po. What are you doing up there?

02:57.241 --> 02:58.503
Nothing.

03:02.046 --> 03:05.777
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

03:12.256 --> 03:15.521
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

03:15.593 --> 03:16.958
Coming!

03:27.371 --> 03:28.497
Sorry, Dad.

03:28.573 --> 03:31.406
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

03:31.475 --> 03:33.841
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

03:33.911 --> 03:36.402
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.708
About what?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.374
What were you dreaming about?

03:39.450 --> 03:40.974
What was I?

03:41.819 --> 03:43.810
I was dreaming about...

03:45.856 --> 03:46.845
...noodles.

03:47.325 --> 03:50.988
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

03:51.062 --> 03:53.622
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

03:53.698 --> 03:56.166
Careful! That soup is sharp.

03:56.234 --> 03:57.701
Oh, happy day!

03:57.768 --> 04:01.670
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

04:03.074 --> 04:07.067
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

04:07.144 --> 04:09.009
This is a sign, Po.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.877
A sign of what?

04:10.948 --> 04:15.578
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

04:15.653 --> 04:17.916
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

04:17.988 --> 04:23.120
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

04:23.194 --> 04:26.686
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

04:26.764 --> 04:29.426
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.196
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

04:32.270 --> 04:34.568
No, it was the dream.

04:34.639 --> 04:38.200
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

04:38.276 --> 04:42.178
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

04:42.246 --> 04:44.111
Something besides noodles?

04:44.181 --> 04:47.116
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

04:47.184 --> 04:51.245
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

04:51.322 --> 04:52.448
Why didn't you?

04:52.523 --> 04:54.286
Because it was a stupid dream.

04:55.059 --> 04:58.495
Can you imagine me making tofu?

04:59.297 --> 05:00.992
Tofu.

05:01.065 --> 05:04.466
No! We all have our place in this world.

05:04.535 --> 05:07.095
Mine is here, and yours is...

05:07.171 --> 05:08.399
I know, is here.

05:08.472 --> 05:11.600
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

05:11.676 --> 05:13.735
Service with a smile.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.340
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

05:47.411 --> 05:50.574
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

05:50.648 --> 05:53.549
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

05:53.617 --> 05:55.448
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

05:55.519 --> 05:57.953
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

06:08.866 --> 06:12.302
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

06:18.642 --> 06:23.079
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

06:23.147 --> 06:25.274
So, nothing's wrong?

06:25.349 --> 06:27.977
Well, I didn't say that.

06:46.437 --> 06:47.699
You were saying?

06:47.805 --> 06:50.865
I have had a vision.

06:50.941 --> 06:53.671
Tai Lung will return.

06:58.616 --> 07:01.176
That is impossible! He is in prison.

07:01.252 --> 07:04.016
Nothing is impossible.

07:04.889 --> 07:05.878
Zeng!

07:05.956 --> 07:08.288
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

07:08.359 --> 07:11.692
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

07:11.762 --> 07:13.662
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

07:13.731 --> 07:15.198
Yes, Master Shifu!

07:17.034 --> 07:22.199
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

07:22.273 --> 07:26.266
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

07:26.343 --> 07:27.332
He'll...

07:27.411 --> 07:29.709
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.216
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

07:34.118 --> 07:36.382
But if you allow it to settle...

07:36.787 --> 07:39.449
...the answer becomes clear.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.556
The Dragon Scroll.

07:45.429 --> 07:46.987
It is time.

07:47.064 --> 07:51.797
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

07:51.869 --> 07:56.602
To become the Dragon Warrior?

07:56.674 --> 07:58.141
I don't know.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.903
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

08:02.813 --> 08:03.837
Watch it!

08:03.914 --> 08:05.404
Sorry. Suck it up!

08:06.851 --> 08:09.581
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

08:09.653 --> 08:10.642
What?

08:12.756 --> 08:16.021
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

08:16.093 --> 08:20.689
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

08:20.764 --> 08:23.824
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

08:23.901 --> 08:28.031
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

08:28.105 --> 08:30.096
Po! Where are you going?

08:31.008 --> 08:33.340
To the Jade Palace.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.707
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

08:35.779 --> 08:40.341
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.816
Selling noodles?

08:44.522 --> 08:46.922
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

08:46.991 --> 08:49.118
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

08:52.963 --> 08:57.525
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

08:57.601 --> 08:59.296
That's my boy!

08:59.403 --> 09:01.633
I told you that dream was a sign.

09:01.672 --> 09:04.641
Yeah. Glad I had it.

09:08.846 --> 09:11.246
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

09:11.315 --> 09:13.840
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

09:48.352 --> 09:51.116
Come on. Come on!

09:51.188 --> 09:53.053
Almost there.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.283
What?

09:54.358 --> 09:57.020
No! Oh, no!

09:59.363 --> 10:02.924
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

10:07.371 --> 10:10.863
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.479
It is an historic day.

10:17.548 --> 10:19.311
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

10:19.383 --> 10:24.252
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

10:24.321 --> 10:26.312
Are your students ready?

10:26.390 --> 10:28.153
Yes, Master Oogway.

10:29.326 --> 10:31.055
Know this, old friend.

10:31.128 --> 10:35.462
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

10:35.532 --> 10:38.160
...but also to you.

10:41.872 --> 10:41.972
Let the tournament begin!

10:41.972 --> 10:45.635
Let the tournament begin!

10:57.087 --> 10:58.452
Yeah.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.186
No, no, wait!

11:02.259 --> 11:04.591
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

11:04.662 --> 11:05.890
Yes!

11:08.899 --> 11:11.265
Hey! Open the door!

11:13.170 --> 11:16.264
Let me in!

11:16.340 --> 11:18.900
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

11:18.976 --> 11:22.673
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

11:22.746 --> 11:26.910
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

11:26.984 --> 11:28.315
The Furious Five!

11:41.098 --> 11:42.565
Yeah, the Furious Five!

11:44.868 --> 11:46.199
Warriors, prepare!

11:46.270 --> 11:48.830
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

11:48.906 --> 11:50.237
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.300
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

11:56.613 --> 11:57.739
Look at that.

11:57.815 --> 11:59.806
Hey! Get out of the way!

12:32.950 --> 12:36.351
And finally Master Tigress!

12:37.788 --> 12:42.191
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

12:42.259 --> 12:43.521
I know!

12:43.594 --> 12:48.691
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

13:01.111 --> 13:05.548
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

13:10.687 --> 13:13.713
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

13:13.791 --> 13:18.319
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

13:19.296 --> 13:21.457
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

13:22.733 --> 13:24.223
Yeah.

13:40.751 --> 13:41.775
Po!

13:41.852 --> 13:43.786
What are you doing?!

13:43.854 --> 13:46.414
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

13:46.490 --> 13:48.424
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

13:51.728 --> 13:55.858
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

13:56.733 --> 13:59.759
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

14:02.573 --> 14:06.100
I love kung fu!

14:18.255 --> 14:23.124
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

14:25.729 --> 14:27.128
OK.

14:33.203 --> 14:34.966
Come back!

14:59.196 --> 15:00.993
What's going on?

15:01.765 --> 15:03.426
Where?

15:05.936 --> 15:07.494
What are you pointing?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.231
OK. Sorry.

15:12.309 --> 15:14.777
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

15:14.845 --> 15:16.779
How interesting.

15:16.847 --> 15:20.146
Master, are you pointing at me?

15:20.217 --> 15:22.242
- Him.
- Who?

15:24.288 --> 15:26.449
- You.
- Me?

15:26.523 --> 15:32.018
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

15:32.262 --> 15:33.695
- What?
- What?!

15:33.764 --> 15:35.459
- What?!
- What?!

15:45.342 --> 15:47.936
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

15:56.720 --> 15:58.950
Master Oogway, wait.

15:59.056 --> 16:03.288
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

16:03.327 --> 16:07.058
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

16:07.130 --> 16:08.563
That was just an accident!

16:08.632 --> 16:11.396
There are no accidents.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.280
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

16:29.353 --> 16:32.686
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

16:32.756 --> 16:35.088
then I will have failed you.

16:53.377 --> 16:56.107
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

16:56.179 --> 16:58.443
...from Master Shifu.

17:03.186 --> 17:04.278
What?!

17:04.354 --> 17:05.685
"Double the guard?!"

17:05.756 --> 17:07.553
"Extra precautions?!"

17:07.624 --> 17:09.955
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

17:13.063 --> 17:16.521
You doubt my prison security?!

17:16.599 --> 17:18.464
Absolutely not.

17:18.535 --> 17:21.663
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

17:21.738 --> 17:25.367
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

17:26.009 --> 17:29.137
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

17:34.384 --> 17:36.318
Impressive, isn't it?

17:37.287 --> 17:39.084
It's very impressive.

17:39.156 --> 17:40.646
It's very impressive.

17:40.724 --> 17:43.386
One way in, one way out.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.556
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.156
Yes, except that prisoner...

17:50.233 --> 17:51.928
...is Tai Lung.

17:56.006 --> 17:57.735
Take us down.

18:03.246 --> 18:04.611
What are you doing?

18:15.959 --> 18:17.426
Oh, my.

18:21.698 --> 18:24.758
Behold Tai Lung.

18:26.436 --> 18:29.496
I'm just gonna wait right here.

18:29.573 --> 18:33.873
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

18:33.944 --> 18:36.208
Crossbows! At the ready!

18:36.279 --> 18:38.076
Crossbows?

18:38.148 --> 18:40.708
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

18:40.784 --> 18:45.278
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.016
Don't get him mad.

18:47.090 --> 18:51.891
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

18:56.133 --> 19:00.092
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

19:00.203 --> 19:02.000
I'm good. I've seen enough.

19:02.038 --> 19:04.472
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

19:04.541 --> 19:05.769
No, he doesn't.

19:05.842 --> 19:08.072
I'll tell him that.

19:08.145 --> 19:10.010
Can we please go now?

19:25.595 --> 19:28.498
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

19:28.498 --> 19:29.021
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

19:34.738 --> 19:36.171
Wait a second!

19:41.178 --> 19:45.842
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

19:48.785 --> 19:52.118
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

19:53.089 --> 19:54.522
Look at this place.

19:56.693 --> 20:01.130
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

20:03.400 --> 20:05.061
The Sword of Heroes!

20:05.135 --> 20:08.400
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.136
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

20:14.778 --> 20:17.975
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.812
No!

20:27.157 --> 20:29.921
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

20:29.993 --> 20:33.156
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

20:36.533 --> 20:37.659
Hello.

20:37.734 --> 20:40.066
Have you finished sight-seeing?

20:40.136 --> 20:42.229
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

20:42.305 --> 20:44.273
My patience is wearing thin.

20:44.341 --> 20:47.174
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

20:47.244 --> 20:49.610
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

20:49.679 --> 20:50.703
How's it going?

20:50.780 --> 20:53.214
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

20:55.819 --> 20:57.582
Someone... broke that.

20:57.654 --> 21:00.020
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

21:00.991 --> 21:02.185
...glue?

21:05.195 --> 21:06.184
A splinter.

21:06.263 --> 21:09.255
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

21:09.332 --> 21:12.460
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

21:12.535 --> 21:16.266
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

21:16.339 --> 21:19.274
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

21:21.478 --> 21:23.912
So, how does this work?

21:23.980 --> 21:26.881
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

21:28.218 --> 21:32.245
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

21:32.322 --> 21:34.222
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

21:34.291 --> 21:37.317
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

21:37.394 --> 21:41.455
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.555
Someone like me?

21:42.632 --> 21:47.296
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

21:47.370 --> 21:49.838
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

21:49.906 --> 21:52.739
And this ridiculous belly.

21:52.809 --> 21:56.074
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

21:56.146 --> 21:58.307
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.906
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

22:01.017 --> 22:02.882
Listen, Oogway said I was...

22:02.919 --> 22:05.615
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

22:05.689 --> 22:08.419
Oh, you know this hold?

22:08.491 --> 22:11.153
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

22:11.227 --> 22:13.991
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

22:14.864 --> 22:17.526
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

22:17.600 --> 22:21.468
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

22:21.538 --> 22:23.665
OK, OK, take it easy.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.174
Now listen closely, panda.

22:26.242 --> 22:29.370
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

22:29.446 --> 22:34.349
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

22:34.517 --> 22:37.645
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

22:37.721 --> 22:39.450
Good.

22:39.522 --> 22:41.456
I can't wait to get started.

23:21.064 --> 23:23.328
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

23:23.633 --> 23:24.930
What?

23:26.503 --> 23:28.971
- Now?
- Yes, now.

23:29.038 --> 23:33.338
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

23:33.410 --> 23:34.968
Oh, OK, well...

23:35.044 --> 23:39.037
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

23:39.115 --> 23:41.879
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

23:41.951 --> 23:45.785
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

23:45.855 --> 23:46.913
What level is that?

23:46.990 --> 23:50.448
Well, I'm not a master, but...

23:50.527 --> 23:53.291
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

23:53.363 --> 23:57.459
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

23:57.534 --> 24:00.298
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

24:00.403 --> 24:05.466
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

24:05.508 --> 24:06.873
But if you insist...

24:06.943 --> 24:09.707
The Furious Five!

24:09.779 --> 24:14.045
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.880
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

24:21.758 --> 24:25.125
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

24:25.195 --> 24:26.184
Hit it.

24:26.296 --> 24:30.926
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.766
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

24:34.838 --> 24:35.964
Just hit it.

24:36.806 --> 24:37.932
All right.

24:38.908 --> 24:42.309
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

24:42.378 --> 24:45.404
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

24:45.482 --> 24:47.677
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.742
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.617
You've only seen praying mantis.

24:52.689 --> 24:54.623
Or monkey style.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.623
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

24:57.694 --> 25:00.060
Would you hit it!

25:00.163 --> 25:02.290
All right. All right.

25:08.004 --> 25:11.098
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

25:12.842 --> 25:14.104
How's that?

25:24.888 --> 25:26.378
That hurts.

25:33.396 --> 25:35.557
This will be easier than I thought.

25:35.632 --> 25:38.123
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

25:38.968 --> 25:40.265
Those are hard!

25:44.641 --> 25:46.074
My tenders.

26:14.170 --> 26:15.865
How did I do?

26:15.939 --> 26:19.739
There is now a level zero.

26:19.809 --> 26:19.909
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

26:19.909 --> 26:22.207
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

26:22.278 --> 26:24.610
What was Master Oogway thinking?

26:24.681 --> 26:26.979
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.541
He is so mighty!

26:29.619 --> 26:34.454
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

26:34.524 --> 26:37.357
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

26:38.361 --> 26:42.627
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

26:42.699 --> 26:44.724
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

26:44.801 --> 26:47.201
Or even see his toes.

27:11.561 --> 27:12.721
OK.

27:21.537 --> 27:23.164
Great.

27:38.021 --> 27:39.613
Hi. You're up.

27:39.689 --> 27:41.088
I am now.

27:41.257 --> 27:42.656
I was just...

27:42.725 --> 27:44.625
Some day, huh?

27:44.694 --> 27:49.097
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

27:50.133 --> 27:54.934
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

27:55.672 --> 27:59.005
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

27:59.108 --> 28:01.542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

28:01.577 --> 28:04.444
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

28:04.514 --> 28:07.210
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

28:07.283 --> 28:10.775
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

28:13.556 --> 28:15.888
Sorry about that.

28:15.958 --> 28:18.449
Look, you don't belong here.

28:20.163 --> 28:23.064
I know. I know. You're right.

28:23.132 --> 28:25.623
I don't have... I just...

28:25.702 --> 28:27.226
My whole life I dreamed of...

28:27.303 --> 28:32.172
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

28:33.543 --> 28:35.602
Property of Crane.

28:35.678 --> 28:37.543
OK. Right, right.

28:37.613 --> 28:40.138
So, you want to get to sleep.

28:40.216 --> 28:42.013
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

28:42.085 --> 28:44.212
We got big things tomorrow.

28:44.287 --> 28:48.485
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

28:52.328 --> 28:53.488
What was that?

28:53.563 --> 28:54.996
I didn't say anything.

28:55.064 --> 28:57.225
OK. All right. Good night.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.494
Sleep well.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.169
That seemed a little awkward.

29:05.141 --> 29:07.632
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

29:07.710 --> 29:10.406
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.777
This is your room.

29:11.848 --> 29:15.147
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

29:15.218 --> 29:17.584
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

29:17.653 --> 29:21.282
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

29:21.624 --> 29:23.785
you will be gone by morning.

29:29.232 --> 29:30.859
Big fan!

29:38.274 --> 29:42.108
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

29:44.447 --> 29:49.146
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

29:49.218 --> 29:54.155
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

29:54.223 --> 29:58.216
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

29:59.495 --> 30:01.895
So why are you so upset?

30:07.036 --> 30:10.563
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.269
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

30:14.343 --> 30:15.435
Probably.

30:15.511 --> 30:19.208
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

30:19.282 --> 30:20.271
Totally.

30:20.349 --> 30:24.410
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

30:26.556 --> 30:28.456
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

30:28.524 --> 30:32.085
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

30:32.161 --> 30:35.096
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

30:36.699 --> 30:40.100
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

30:43.272 --> 30:45.433
Quit, don't quit.

30:45.508 --> 30:49.535
Noodles, don't noodles.

30:49.612 --> 30:54.276
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.215
There's a saying:

30:56.285 --> 30:58.719
Yesterday is history,

30:58.821 --> 31:01.255
tomorrow is a mystery,

31:01.290 --> 31:04.418
but today is a gift.

31:04.493 --> 31:07.291
That is why it is called the present.

31:37.293 --> 31:39.659
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

31:39.729 --> 31:42.220
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

31:50.973 --> 31:52.600
Fire crossbows!

31:52.675 --> 31:54.006
Fire!

31:56.646 --> 31:57.670
Fire!

32:05.321 --> 32:08.017
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.923
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

32:10.993 --> 32:12.119
Bring it up!

32:14.864 --> 32:16.354
Wait! Bring it back!

32:35.151 --> 32:39.144
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

33:46.889 --> 33:50.120
We're dead. So very, very dead.

33:50.826 --> 33:52.885
Not yet we're not. Now!

34:40.576 --> 34:43.272
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

35:04.133 --> 35:05.532
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

35:07.803 --> 35:10.636
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

35:10.706 --> 35:12.731
Fly back there and tell them...

35:12.808 --> 35:16.539
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

35:28.524 --> 35:30.048
Good morning, Master!

35:31.527 --> 35:33.154
Panda!

35:33.229 --> 35:34.218
Panda!

35:34.597 --> 35:35.791
Wake up!

35:39.335 --> 35:40.563
He's quit.

35:42.571 --> 35:47.634
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

35:47.710 --> 35:50.804
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

35:50.880 --> 35:53.508
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

35:55.017 --> 35:56.541
What are you doing here?!

35:57.486 --> 35:59.477
Hi! Good morning, Master!

35:59.588 --> 36:01.453
I thought I'd warm up a little.

36:03.592 --> 36:04.581
You're stuck.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.026
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

36:08.030 --> 36:10.828
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.834
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

36:13.969 --> 36:16.437
Maybe on three. One, two...

36:17.506 --> 36:18.700
...three.

36:20.476 --> 36:22.137
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

36:22.211 --> 36:25.146
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

36:25.214 --> 36:29.514
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

36:29.585 --> 36:32.952
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

36:33.022 --> 36:36.788
And years longer to apply it in combat!

36:46.202 --> 36:47.726
Put that down!

36:47.803 --> 36:52.297
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

36:52.374 --> 36:55.309
Yeah! Excellent.

36:56.111 --> 36:57.305
Let's get started.

36:59.615 --> 37:01.480
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

37:03.452 --> 37:06.444
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

37:06.522 --> 37:09.821
That was awesome! Let's go again!

37:36.185 --> 37:39.120
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

37:39.188 --> 37:41.520
Your next opponent will be me.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.353
All right! Yeah, let's go!

37:45.861 --> 37:47.920
Step forth.

37:47.997 --> 37:51.455
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

37:51.533 --> 37:53.398
...and make him suffer for it.

37:53.469 --> 37:54.800
Oh, yeah!

37:54.870 --> 37:58.237
To take his strength
and use it against him...

37:58.307 --> 38:00.798
...until he finally falls...

38:00.909 --> 38:01.898
...or quits.

38:01.944 --> 38:03.935
A real warrior never quits.

38:04.013 --> 38:07.210
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

38:17.593 --> 38:20.790
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.194
But he will.

38:22.264 --> 38:24.562
He's not going to quit, is he?

38:24.633 --> 38:27.397
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

38:39.281 --> 38:42.341
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

38:42.418 --> 38:43.442
Trust me, it will.

38:43.519 --> 38:47.148
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

38:47.222 --> 38:49.884
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

38:49.958 --> 38:50.947
Sure you were.

38:51.026 --> 38:55.087
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

38:56.265 --> 38:57.254
I'm over here.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.801
Maybe you should look at this again.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.303
Oh, OK.

39:06.108 --> 39:08.099
Stop it. Stop!

39:09.278 --> 39:12.213
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

39:12.548 --> 39:16.211
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

39:21.156 --> 39:23.556
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

39:24.193 --> 39:26.161
...but he wasn't always like that.

39:26.228 --> 39:27.559
According to legend,

39:27.629 --> 39:32.157
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

39:32.234 --> 39:34.168
- No!
- Yes.

39:34.236 --> 39:35.498
But that was before.

39:35.571 --> 39:37.562
Before what?

39:37.639 --> 39:38.970
Before Tai Lung.

39:39.074 --> 39:41.634
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

39:41.710 --> 39:44.702
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.714
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

39:46.782 --> 39:52.243
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

39:52.321 --> 39:56.485
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

39:56.558 --> 39:58.685
He wasn't just a student.

40:03.031 --> 40:05.864
Shifu found him as a cub...

40:07.503 --> 40:10.438
...and he raised him as his son.

40:12.808 --> 40:15.868
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

40:16.979 --> 40:19.243
...Shifu trained him.

40:19.314 --> 40:23.444
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

40:25.154 --> 40:26.883
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

40:29.625 --> 40:31.217
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

40:31.293 --> 40:35.593
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

40:35.931 --> 40:39.628
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

40:42.104 --> 40:44.129
He tried to take the scroll by force.

40:44.206 --> 40:48.802
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

40:50.779 --> 40:52.337
But how could he?

41:06.495 --> 41:10.659
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

41:18.907 --> 41:20.169
Or since.

41:28.650 --> 41:31.517
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

41:31.587 --> 41:33.817
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

41:33.889 --> 41:36.915
And he's stuck with you.

41:36.992 --> 41:40.860
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

41:41.763 --> 41:42.752
That is it!

41:42.831 --> 41:45.959
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

41:48.403 --> 41:50.871
And may have also stopped his heart.

41:54.543 --> 41:56.101
Inner peace.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.370
Inner peace.

42:02.351 --> 42:04.046
Inner...

42:05.654 --> 42:07.554
Inner peace.

42:10.526 --> 42:15.054
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

42:18.300 --> 42:19.562
Inner...

42:24.172 --> 42:26.231
Oh, Zeng.

42:26.308 --> 42:27.900
Excellent.

42:27.976 --> 42:29.910
I could use some good news right now.

42:37.686 --> 42:39.051
Master! Master!

42:39.721 --> 42:43.987
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

42:44.059 --> 42:46.425
Shifu.

42:46.495 --> 42:49.896
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

42:49.965 --> 42:53.628
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

42:53.702 --> 42:57.103
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

42:58.574 --> 43:01.304
That is bad news...

43:01.376 --> 43:05.710
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

43:05.781 --> 43:10.047
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

43:10.118 --> 43:13.417
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

43:13.488 --> 43:15.786
There are no accidents.

43:17.025 --> 43:20.153
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

43:20.228 --> 43:24.426
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

43:24.499 --> 43:25.591
Thrice.

43:25.667 --> 43:27.294
My old friend,

43:27.369 --> 43:31.965
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

43:32.040 --> 43:35.601
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

43:35.677 --> 43:37.042
Illusion?

43:37.112 --> 43:40.104
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

43:40.182 --> 43:43.208
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

43:43.285 --> 43:46.550
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

43:46.622 --> 43:49.147
But there are things we can control.

43:50.225 --> 43:53.319
I can control when the fruit will fall.

43:54.396 --> 43:56.091
And I can control...

43:57.165 --> 43:59.156
...where to plant the seed.

43:59.668 --> 44:01.761
That is no illusion, Master.

44:03.405 --> 44:05.396
Yes.

44:05.474 --> 44:07.874
But no matter what you do

44:07.943 --> 44:10.878
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

44:10.946 --> 44:15.815
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

44:15.884 --> 44:19.513
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

44:19.588 --> 44:22.250
Maybe it can.

44:22.324 --> 44:25.122
If you are willing to guide it.

44:25.193 --> 44:27.058
To nurture it.

44:27.129 --> 44:28.528
To believe in it.

44:28.597 --> 44:31.065
But how? How?

44:31.133 --> 44:33.101
I need your help, Master.

44:33.168 --> 44:36.865
No, you just need to believe.

44:37.572 --> 44:39.870
Promise me, Shifu.

44:40.475 --> 44:43.171
Promise me you will believe.

44:43.245 --> 44:46.806
I will try.

44:47.649 --> 44:49.139
Good.

44:51.319 --> 44:53.378
My time has come.

44:55.590 --> 44:59.959
You must continue
your journey without me.

45:00.062 --> 45:01.757
What are you? Wait!

45:03.865 --> 45:05.162
Master!

45:06.001 --> 45:07.559
You can't leave me!

45:11.339 --> 45:13.967
You must believe.

45:14.910 --> 45:16.502
Master!

45:46.942 --> 45:49.604
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

45:49.678 --> 45:52.613
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

45:52.948 --> 45:54.779
...but you're a lousy tipper."

45:54.850 --> 45:57.785
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

45:58.653 --> 46:00.951
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

46:01.289 --> 46:02.756
...but I thought it...

46:02.824 --> 46:04.587
...in my mind.

46:04.659 --> 46:07.719
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

46:08.296 --> 46:10.457
Order up! Hope you like it.

46:12.367 --> 46:15.598
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

46:15.670 --> 46:19.970
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

46:20.041 --> 46:22.441
What do you mean? This is amazing!

46:22.511 --> 46:25.446
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

46:25.514 --> 46:27.414
Tigress, you've got to try this.

46:27.482 --> 46:31.111
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

46:31.186 --> 46:35.987
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

46:37.359 --> 46:41.261
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

46:41.329 --> 46:46.323
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

46:50.739 --> 46:53.833
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

46:56.611 --> 47:00.638
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

47:01.883 --> 47:05.319
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

47:05.387 --> 47:08.220
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

47:08.290 --> 47:10.190
...you will have ears like mine.

47:11.793 --> 47:13.192
That's good.

47:13.795 --> 47:17.196
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

47:17.532 --> 47:18.658
It's Shifu!

47:18.733 --> 47:21.566
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

47:23.371 --> 47:24.963
Master Shifu!

47:28.009 --> 47:29.704
You think this is funny?

47:29.778 --> 47:32.747
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

47:32.814 --> 47:35.112
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

47:35.183 --> 47:37.549
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

47:41.223 --> 47:43.851
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

47:43.925 --> 47:46.223
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

47:46.294 --> 47:49.127
What? You're serious? And I have to?

47:50.999 --> 47:53.968
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

47:54.035 --> 47:55.559
Oogway cannot!

47:56.071 --> 47:57.470
Not anymore.

47:58.974 --> 48:01.670
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

48:01.743 --> 48:03.370
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

48:03.445 --> 48:07.040
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

48:07.115 --> 48:10.676
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

48:10.752 --> 48:12.344
It is his!

48:12.420 --> 48:13.546
Where'd he go?

48:20.896 --> 48:24.195
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

48:24.266 --> 48:25.824
Watch me.

48:28.436 --> 48:29.528
Come on.

48:29.604 --> 48:33.438
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

48:33.508 --> 48:36.500
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

48:37.312 --> 48:40.577
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

48:40.649 --> 48:43.641
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

48:43.718 --> 48:46.050
Yes! I was.

48:46.121 --> 48:51.252
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

48:52.327 --> 48:56.058
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

48:56.131 --> 49:00.465
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

49:00.568 --> 49:02.593
Yeah, I stayed.

49:02.637 --> 49:06.403
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

49:06.474 --> 49:10.877
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

49:10.946 --> 49:14.177
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

49:15.150 --> 49:19.484
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

49:19.821 --> 49:22.881
...could make me... not me...

49:22.958 --> 49:24.323
...it was you.

49:24.559 --> 49:27.528
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

49:27.595 --> 49:29.187
But I can change you!

49:29.264 --> 49:32.791
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

49:32.867 --> 49:36.860
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

49:36.938 --> 49:40.339
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

49:40.408 --> 49:44.674
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

49:46.982 --> 49:47.971
How?

49:49.617 --> 49:50.606
How?

49:53.655 --> 49:55.850
- How?!
- I don't know!

50:03.898 --> 50:05.456
I don't know.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.270
That's what I thought.

50:52.914 --> 50:55.075
This is what you trained me for.

51:02.223 --> 51:03.212
Tigress!

51:07.462 --> 51:09.259
Don't try and stop me.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.524
We're not trying to stop you.

51:13.601 --> 51:14.590
What?

51:14.669 --> 51:16.534
We're coming with you!

52:29.711 --> 52:33.238
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

52:34.482 --> 52:35.847
No need to explain.

52:35.917 --> 52:40.081
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

53:01.009 --> 53:02.704
Don't tell Monkey.

53:02.777 --> 53:05.940
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

53:06.014 --> 53:09.006
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

53:09.083 --> 53:11.847
I don't know. I guess that...

53:12.187 --> 53:14.485
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

53:14.556 --> 53:16.456
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

53:17.492 --> 53:19.824
And you have done a perfect spilt.

53:19.894 --> 53:22.863
No, this? This is just...

53:23.598 --> 53:24.929
...an accident.

53:29.170 --> 53:32.230
There are no accidents.

53:32.307 --> 53:33.365
Come with me.

53:41.382 --> 53:44.818
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

53:44.886 --> 53:47.616
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

53:57.532 --> 54:00.000
You dragged me...

54:00.101 --> 54:01.796
...all the way out here...

54:01.836 --> 54:03.167
...for a bath?

54:06.808 --> 54:08.139
Panda...

54:08.209 --> 54:11.838
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

54:13.081 --> 54:14.105
The Pool of...

54:14.182 --> 54:16.776
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

54:16.851 --> 54:19.046
...of harmony and focus.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.645
This is the birthplace...

54:21.723 --> 54:22.985
...of kung fu.

54:36.971 --> 54:39.235
Do you want to learn kung fu?

54:39.307 --> 54:40.296
Yeah!

54:40.375 --> 54:43.640
Then I am your master!

54:43.711 --> 54:45.474
OK!

54:46.814 --> 54:47.906
Don't cry.

54:47.982 --> 54:49.313
OK.

54:55.056 --> 54:57.047
When you focus on kung fu,

54:57.125 --> 54:59.252
when you concentrate...

54:59.360 --> 55:00.827
...you stink.

55:00.862 --> 55:02.762
Perhaps that is my fault.

55:02.830 --> 55:06.288
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

55:06.367 --> 55:09.461
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

55:09.537 --> 55:10.834
...is with this.

55:10.905 --> 55:13.669
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

55:14.575 --> 55:15.633
Good.

55:15.710 --> 55:18.406
When you have been trained, you may eat.

55:19.847 --> 55:21.007
Let us begin.

56:31.719 --> 56:32.811
After you, panda.

56:32.887 --> 56:34.855
Just like that?

56:34.922 --> 56:38.585
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

56:38.659 --> 56:43.153
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

56:48.569 --> 56:50.161
Enjoy.

56:51.739 --> 56:53.172
Hey!

56:53.241 --> 56:56.369
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

56:57.712 --> 56:59.179
Hey!

57:05.453 --> 57:07.421
You are free to eat.

57:07.488 --> 57:09.388
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

58:35.776 --> 58:37.300
I'm not hungry.

58:40.915 --> 58:42.109
Master.

59:12.246 --> 59:13.543
Cut it!

59:30.765 --> 59:32.562
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

59:32.633 --> 59:35.625
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

59:35.703 --> 59:37.898
You think I'm a fool?

59:37.972 --> 59:41.601
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

59:41.676 --> 59:44.941
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

59:45.012 --> 59:49.449
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

59:49.517 --> 59:55.114
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

59:55.189 --> 59:58.283
Finally, a worthy opponent.

59:58.359 --> 01:00:00.850
Our battle will be legendary!

01:00:20.848 --> 01:00:22.543
We've got this. Help her.

01:00:47.174 --> 01:00:48.163
Monkey!

01:00:48.242 --> 01:00:50.073
Go!

01:00:50.144 --> 01:00:51.338
What was I thinking?!

01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:02.780
Mantis!

01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:09.462
Now!

01:01:55.376 --> 01:01:57.674
Shifu taught you well.

01:02:00.648 --> 01:02:02.582
But he didn't teach you everything.

01:02:06.687 --> 01:02:08.177
You have done well, panda.

01:02:08.255 --> 01:02:11.952
Done well? Done well?

01:02:12.026 --> 01:02:13.323
I've done awesome!

01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:18.226
The mark of a true hero is humility.

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:20.995
But, yes, you have done...

01:02:21.602 --> 01:02:22.933
...awesome.

01:02:30.177 --> 01:02:33.510
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

01:02:33.581 --> 01:02:37.017
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

01:02:37.084 --> 01:02:39.075
We were no match for his nerve attach.

01:02:39.153 --> 01:02:41.383
He's gotten stronger.

01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:43.753
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

01:02:44.959 --> 01:02:45.948
He's too fast!

01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:47.584
Sorry, Po.

01:02:49.663 --> 01:02:51.221
I thought we could stop him.

01:02:51.298 --> 01:02:53.129
He could have killed you.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.258
Why didn't he?

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:58.738
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

01:02:58.839 --> 01:03:03.139
It might. I mean, a little.

01:03:03.177 --> 01:03:04.405
I'm pretty scared.

01:03:04.478 --> 01:03:05.968
You can defeat him, panda!

01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:08.981
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:12.041
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

01:03:12.119 --> 01:03:15.486
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

01:03:20.828 --> 01:03:23.319
You really believe I'm ready?

01:03:23.397 --> 01:03:25.058
You are...

01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:26.429
...Po.

01:04:15.382 --> 01:04:18.943
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

01:04:19.019 --> 01:04:20.953
It is yours.

01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:23.956
Wait. What happens when I read it?

01:04:24.024 --> 01:04:28.051
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

01:04:28.128 --> 01:04:30.358
Really? That's cool.

01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:33.264
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

01:04:33.334 --> 01:04:36.235
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

01:04:36.904 --> 01:04:38.337
Can I punch through walls?

01:04:38.405 --> 01:04:40.771
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

01:04:40.841 --> 01:04:42.035
- Will I?
- Focus.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:43.842
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:46.812
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

01:04:46.881 --> 01:04:49.076
Read it and become...

01:04:49.149 --> 01:04:50.878
...the Dragon Warrior.

01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:59.224
It's impossible to open.

01:05:00.194 --> 01:05:03.425
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.293
Thank you.

01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:09.768
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.595
OK, here goes.

01:05:24.618 --> 01:05:26.279
- It's blank.
- What?!

01:05:26.353 --> 01:05:29.948
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

01:05:35.663 --> 01:05:38.530
Blank. I don't...

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:40.793
I don't understand.

01:05:42.102 --> 01:05:44.798
OK. So, like...

01:05:44.872 --> 01:05:48.103
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

01:05:48.175 --> 01:05:50.769
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

01:05:50.844 --> 01:05:54.905
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

01:05:54.982 --> 01:05:59.112
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:01.849
But who will stop Tai Lung?

01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:04.413
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

01:06:04.491 --> 01:06:06.152
No.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:11.989
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

01:06:12.066 --> 01:06:14.466
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:17.231
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:18.771
for everyone to escape.

01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:21.273
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

01:06:21.342 --> 01:06:24.175
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

01:06:25.145 --> 01:06:27.238
Listen to me, all of you.

01:06:27.314 --> 01:06:30.841
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

01:06:30.918 --> 01:06:33.910
I am very proud
to have been your master.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:57.074
We've got to get them out safely.

01:06:57.144 --> 01:06:59.476
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.072
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

01:07:03.117 --> 01:07:04.880
Crane, light the way.

01:07:23.937 --> 01:07:26.963
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

01:07:35.682 --> 01:07:37.081
Hey, Dad.

01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:38.981
Po!

01:07:44.892 --> 01:07:46.985
Good to have you back, son.

01:07:49.463 --> 01:07:50.953
Good to be back.

01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:52.658
Let's go, Po.

01:07:55.169 --> 01:07:58.002
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

01:07:58.272 --> 01:08:01.764
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:04.202
...no longer slices.

01:08:04.278 --> 01:08:07.714
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:10.944
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

01:08:12.252 --> 01:08:13.446
You like that?

01:08:19.593 --> 01:08:24.189
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

01:08:24.264 --> 01:08:27.290
It just wasn't meant to be.

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.261
Po, forget everything else.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.535
Your destiny still awaits.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:40.376
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:42.745
I don't know, Dad.

01:08:42.816 --> 01:08:46.809
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:51.282
Po...

01:08:51.358 --> 01:08:55.795
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:57.921
...a long time ago.

01:08:57.997 --> 01:08:59.727
OK.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.231
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

01:09:07.975 --> 01:09:12.604
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

01:09:12.679 --> 01:09:13.667
...nothing.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:17.582
You heard me. Nothing!

01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:20.118
There is no secret ingredient!

01:09:20.187 --> 01:09:23.247
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:26.189
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:30.662
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:43.832
There is no secret ingredient.

01:10:06.433 --> 01:10:09.231
I have come home, Master.

01:10:09.303 --> 01:10:12.568
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

01:10:12.639 --> 01:10:16.575
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

01:10:16.643 --> 01:10:19.737
So where is this Po?

01:10:21.181 --> 01:10:22.409
Did I scare him off?

01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:24.814
This battle is between you and me.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.656
So, that is how it's going to be.

01:10:29.723 --> 01:10:31.748
That is how it must be.

01:10:45.906 --> 01:10:50.468
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:52.910
Obeying your master is not weakness!

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.778
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

01:10:55.849 --> 01:10:58.010
You always knew.

01:10:58.085 --> 01:11:03.022
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

01:11:04.157 --> 01:11:06.682
What did you do?!

01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:10.355
Nothing!

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:13.263
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.301
Not your fault?!

01:11:15.369 --> 01:11:17.428
Who filled my head with dreams?!

01:11:17.504 --> 01:11:19.734
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

01:11:19.806 --> 01:11:22.536
Who denied me my destiny?!

01:11:31.785 --> 01:11:34.379
It was never my decision to make!

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.157
It is now.

01:11:46.233 --> 01:11:49.999
Give me the scroll!

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.298
I would rather die.

01:12:41.455 --> 01:12:44.549
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

01:12:44.725 --> 01:12:47.216
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

01:12:48.195 --> 01:12:49.685
Tell me!

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.959
Tell me!

01:13:02.275 --> 01:13:05.642
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.113
From the first moment, I've been...

01:13:10.183 --> 01:13:12.481
...proud of you.

01:13:12.552 --> 01:13:14.918
And it was my pride...

01:13:14.988 --> 01:13:17.013
...that blinded me.

01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:20.651
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

01:13:21.661 --> 01:13:23.925
...what I...

01:13:23.997 --> 01:13:25.988
...was turning you into.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.768
I'm...

01:13:28.835 --> 01:13:29.824
I'm sorry.

01:13:38.345 --> 01:13:41.075
I don't want your apology.

01:13:41.148 --> 01:13:42.672
I want my scroll!

01:13:44.785 --> 01:13:47.117
What?!

01:13:47.187 --> 01:13:48.415
Where is it?!

01:13:49.423 --> 01:13:54.019
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:58.290
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

01:13:58.365 --> 01:13:59.696
Never.

01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:01.623
Never.

01:14:08.575 --> 01:14:09.872
Stairs.

01:14:12.312 --> 01:14:14.109
Who are you?

01:14:14.181 --> 01:14:19.209
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:23.553
You?

01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.492
Him? He's a panda.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.428
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

01:14:30.497 --> 01:14:32.431
Don't tempt me.

01:14:32.499 --> 01:14:36.526
No. I'm gonna use this.

01:14:36.603 --> 01:14:38.230
You want it? Come and get it.

01:14:39.973 --> 01:14:41.270
Finally!

01:15:07.234 --> 01:15:08.701
That scroll is mine!

01:16:02.455 --> 01:16:03.479
Lightning!

01:16:38.692 --> 01:16:40.683
The scroll has given him power!

01:16:41.328 --> 01:16:42.886
No!

01:17:19.366 --> 01:17:23.302
Finally! Oh, yes.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:28.239
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.570
It's nothing!

01:17:36.549 --> 01:17:39.143
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

01:17:39.919 --> 01:17:40.943
What?

01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:43.985
There is no secret ingredient.

01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:48.755
It's just you.

01:17:58.538 --> 01:17:59.596
Stop it!

01:17:59.673 --> 01:18:01.436
I'm gonna pee.

01:18:03.009 --> 01:18:04.636
Don't.

01:18:04.711 --> 01:18:06.372
Don't! Don't!

01:19:13.646 --> 01:19:15.443
You...

01:19:15.515 --> 01:19:17.745
...can't defeat me.

01:19:22.188 --> 01:19:23.416
You...

01:19:24.758 --> 01:19:26.555
...you're just a big...

01:19:26.626 --> 01:19:28.218
...fat...

01:19:28.294 --> 01:19:29.283
...panda!

01:19:30.263 --> 01:19:33.391
I'm not a big fat panda.

01:19:33.466 --> 01:19:35.764
I'm the big fat panda.

01:19:38.037 --> 01:19:39.470
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:40.972
Oh, you know this hold?

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.999
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

01:19:45.078 --> 01:19:46.773
Nope.

01:19:46.846 --> 01:19:49.041
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

01:20:09.569 --> 01:20:10.797
Look!

01:20:11.838 --> 01:20:13.931
The Dragon Warrior.

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:46.270
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

01:20:48.341 --> 01:20:49.433
Yes!

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.268
Thanks, Dad.

01:21:01.554 --> 01:21:02.953
Hey, guys.

01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:09.025
Master.

01:21:09.095 --> 01:21:10.528
Master.

01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:15.196
Master?

01:21:15.268 --> 01:21:16.735
Master Shifu!

01:21:29.782 --> 01:21:31.147
Master!

01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:33.310
Shifu, are you OK?!

01:21:35.688 --> 01:21:37.087
Po.

01:21:37.156 --> 01:21:39.090
You're alive.

01:21:39.158 --> 01:21:40.386
Or we're both dead.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:44.396
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:45.590
You did?

01:21:49.869 --> 01:21:55.603
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

01:21:55.675 --> 01:21:59.167
You are the Dragon Warrior.

01:21:59.913 --> 01:22:02.381
You have brought peace...

01:22:02.448 --> 01:22:05.212
...to this valley...

01:22:05.285 --> 01:22:07.480
...and...

01:22:07.553 --> 01:22:09.180
...and to me.

01:22:09.255 --> 01:22:10.517
Thank you.

01:22:12.358 --> 01:22:15.589
Thank you, Po.

01:22:15.662 --> 01:22:18.256
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:28.764
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

01:22:28.841 --> 01:22:31.571
I'm not dying, you idiot!

01:22:31.644 --> 01:22:33.612
Dragon Warrior...

01:22:34.881 --> 01:22:39.716
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

01:22:42.455 --> 01:22:45.390
So, I should stop talking?

01:22:46.092 --> 01:22:47.719
If you can.

01:23:05.812 --> 01:23:07.404
Want to get something to eat?

01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:11.175
Yeah.

01:23:17.190 --> 01:23:20.591
Everybody is kung fu fighting

01:23:21.427 --> 01:23:24.760
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:23:25.765 --> 01:23:29.098
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

01:23:30.269 --> 01:23:33.761
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

01:23:36.876 --> 01:23:39.936
Everybody is kung fu fighting

01:23:41.214 --> 01:23:44.445
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:23:45.451 --> 01:23:48.784
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

01:23:50.123 --> 01:23:53.115
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:57.156
You are a natural

01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:59.460
Why is that so hard to see?

01:23:59.565 --> 01:24:03.695
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

01:24:03.736 --> 01:24:07.832
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

01:24:07.907 --> 01:24:11.809
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

01:24:11.878 --> 01:24:14.813
Everybody is kung fu fighting

01:24:16.182 --> 01:24:19.379
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.821
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

01:24:24.924 --> 01:24:28.155
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

01:24:29.829 --> 01:24:34.129
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.296
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

01:24:38.371 --> 01:24:42.171
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

01:24:42.241 --> 01:24:46.610
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

01:24:46.679 --> 01:24:49.807
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

01:24:51.117 --> 01:24:54.143
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:24:55.354 --> 01:24:58.482
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

01:24:59.859 --> 01:25:02.987
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

01:25:04.797 --> 01:25:08.392
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

01:25:09.135 --> 01:25:13.595
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

01:25:13.673 --> 01:25:17.700
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

01:25:17.777 --> 01:25:21.543
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:24.708
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

01:25:26.252 --> 01:25:29.312
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:25:30.323 --> 01:25:33.007
Although the future is a
little bit frightening

01:25:34.994 --> 01:25:38.486
It's the book of your life
that you're writing
