00:08.060 --> 00:12.790
Trust. In a successful company like this, that's
the glue that holds everything together.

00:13.105 --> 00:16.909
At Veridian organize Dynamics we even
hold special events to build that trust.

00:16.944 --> 00:19.952
Don't let me go!
I will not let you go!

00:20.138 --> 00:23.215
Come on! It's just like the virtual climbing wall at MIT.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.449
It wasn't there when I was there!

00:25.559 --> 00:26.608
It's virtual.

00:26.643 --> 00:28.743
Technically, it was never there.

00:29.267 --> 00:31.001
Now, don't look down.

00:31.036 --> 00:33.483
I'm falling! I'm falling!

00:33.518 --> 00:34.867
I got you.

00:35.409 --> 00:38.997
<i> Once you have that trust, you know
someone will always have your back.</i>

00:39.032 --> 00:40.713
You realise if this project goes forward,

00:40.747 --> 00:43.718
all the aborigines in Australia will lose their sense of smell.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.800
Which is why I'm going to kill it.

00:45.835 --> 00:48.328
It's just to high a price to pay for fabric software.

00:48.363 --> 00:51.786
If those Aborigines were here, they'd
smell a good man. You ready?

00:51.821 --> 00:53.282
Hair?
Good. Teeth?

00:53.317 --> 00:54.471
Clear. Tie?

00:54.506 --> 00:55.856
Stain.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.260
Got ya.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.846
<i> But the most important thing is the trust
the public has of our products.</i>

01:02.881 --> 01:06.981
<i>That's why many of our products
never get pass the testing phase.</i>

01:08.016 --> 01:10.146
<i>Like a soldier tracking GPS underwear.</i>

01:10.181 --> 01:11.182
Hot!

01:12.036 --> 01:13.036
Hot!

01:13.177 --> 01:17.044
<i> But sometimes, inspite of our best efforts,
a bad product does get through.</i>

01:17.079 --> 01:20.217
<i> And for any corporation, the worst case scenario is...</i>

01:20.252 --> 01:23.652
The company has been sued for something we made.

01:24.123 --> 01:26.675
Is that the numbers the accounting
guy invented for tax purposes?

01:26.710 --> 01:28.983
No.
Then, on a scale from 1 to zurplex,

01:29.018 --> 01:30.900
how bad is it?
It's bad.

01:30.935 --> 01:34.049
Remember that perfume your
team developed about a year ago?

01:34.084 --> 01:37.302
In 3 out of 5000 women, it reacts with their body chemistry

01:37.337 --> 01:39.976
and attracts hornets, who want to mate with them.

01:40.011 --> 01:43.522
And when the hornets realise they've
been deceived, did they just... laugh it off?

01:43.557 --> 01:47.283
If by "laugh" you mean sting over and
over again in endless ways of fury,

01:47.318 --> 01:49.281
then, yes, they have a wonderful sense of humor.

01:49.316 --> 01:51.956
So, is the company offered a settlement?
Generously.

01:51.991 --> 01:56.406
And after buying each woman a new face
of equal or greater value than her original.

01:56.441 --> 01:59.253
But their lawyers are gonna try to screw us, by claiming

01:59.288 --> 02:02.581
we knew the perfume had this problem,
but put it on the market anyway.

02:02.616 --> 02:03.618
What?

02:03.685 --> 02:05.302
That's ridiculous!
Exactly.

02:05.337 --> 02:09.399
So we all gonna have to give depositions and
say that we didn't know this could happen.

02:09.434 --> 02:10.911
But we didn't know it could happen.

02:10.946 --> 02:12.442
Good! That sounds very trustful.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.504
Because we didn't know.
This one wasn't this good.

02:14.539 --> 02:17.323
But we didn't.
There you go! That's the one.

02:17.358 --> 02:18.359
Veronica!

02:18.837 --> 02:21.137
I'd leave my name out of it.

02:23.478 --> 02:26.801
<i>With the public trust at stake, we all gave depositions.</i>

02:26.836 --> 02:29.718
<i> Veronica had done it before and
so knew just what to say.</i>

02:29.753 --> 02:31.150
<i>Or how little to say.</i>

02:31.185 --> 02:33.931
Were you involved in the development of this product?

02:33.966 --> 02:36.892
Yes.
And how would you summarize the company's reaction

02:36.927 --> 02:39.095
when they found out that the women who used this product

02:39.130 --> 02:41.827
were savagely attacked by insects?

02:41.862 --> 02:42.866
Ouch.

02:43.725 --> 02:45.575
Will you elaborate on that please?

02:45.628 --> 02:46.748
No.

02:48.756 --> 02:50.748
Can you describe your job?

02:50.783 --> 02:51.871
Yes.

02:53.886 --> 02:56.036
How would you describe your job?

02:57.089 --> 02:58.490
Cleverly.

03:01.506 --> 03:03.470
My deposition also went well,

03:03.505 --> 03:05.063
although it tooked an odd turn.

03:05.098 --> 03:06.808
Tell me, Mr. Crisp...

03:07.610 --> 03:10.110
would you give this perfume to your wife?

03:10.589 --> 03:11.989
I don't have a wife.

03:13.178 --> 03:15.778
Girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.907
Boyfriend?

03:20.188 --> 03:21.454
No boyfriend.

03:21.767 --> 03:25.307
So there's nobody significant at all in your life?

03:26.948 --> 03:28.953
I mean, that you would give the perfume to.

03:28.988 --> 03:31.238
No, just me and my 8 year-old daughter.

03:36.325 --> 03:39.314
 And Phil? Well, Phil doesn't do well pressure.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.949
Mr. Myman, it says here you went to MIT, is that correct?

03:45.409 --> 03:46.409
No.

03:47.914 --> 03:51.175
I am a liar, a damned dirty liar.

03:52.446 --> 03:56.008
Excuse me?
When I took this job, I lied, on my resume.

03:56.043 --> 04:00.840
I didn't attend MIT, I graduated
from the University of Aruba.

04:01.460 --> 04:05.600
I wanted to be a big fish in
a little pond. I played rugby,

04:05.885 --> 04:10.178
and I am proud of my years as a syphilitic conquistador.

04:10.629 --> 04:14.963
That was the team name, they wanted
something the local found frightening.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.100
 Lem was nervous too.

04:18.135 --> 04:22.136
So nervous he wipped out something
in the lab to keep himself calm.

04:22.373 --> 04:23.561
He may have overwhipped.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.264
Hello cats and kittens.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.225
I am here to testify.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.396
That's nice.

04:33.158 --> 04:34.808
The air feels like J-lo.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.911
<i> But eventually, all the depositions
ended up in the same place.</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:43.199
Were you aware that this product
was potentially dangerous?

04:43.482 --> 04:44.482
No.

04:44.517 --> 04:45.529
No.

04:45.717 --> 04:46.911
Absolutely not.

04:47.279 --> 04:48.705
Negative, Catwoman.

04:49.608 --> 04:50.608
Yes.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.339
Now, what exactly... 

04:53.074 --> 04:54.172
One minute...

04:54.207 --> 04:55.378
Did you just say yes?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.121
Yes.

04:57.590 --> 05:01.509
And did you notified anyone within
the company about the situation?

05:01.544 --> 05:04.044
I sent an email to the CEO.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.601
And I sent another one to... 

05:07.414 --> 05:08.414
Yes.

05:09.148 --> 05:12.198
Miss Zwordling, who else knew about this?

05:12.898 --> 05:13.898
Ted.

05:15.262 --> 05:16.566
Our Ted?

<i> Mistakes...</i>

05:28.138 --> 05:29.829
<i>we all make them.</i>

05:30.150 --> 05:31.873
<i> But sometimes mistakes</i>

05:32.259 --> 05:34.062

05:34.846 --> 05:37.837

05:41.424 --> 05:42.478
<i>When you think about it,</i>

05:42.537 --> 05:45.595
<i> shouldn't you thanking us for making mistakes?</i>

05:53.814 --> 05:57.648
You told the lawyers that you sent me an e-mail
saying that the perfume attracts hornets?

05:57.683 --> 06:00.205
I was under oath. I had to tell the truth ,

06:00.240 --> 06:03.404
which I probably would have done anyway.
It's kind of a bad habit I have.

06:03.439 --> 06:05.740
But it wasn't the truth. You didn't send me an email.

06:05.775 --> 06:07.575
Yes I did.
No, you didn't.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.327
Yes I did.
No, you didn't.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.120
Oh, yes I did.

06:11.155 --> 06:12.674
I didn't get any e-mail,

06:12.709 --> 06:15.041
and you could have at least warn
me that's what you were gonna say.

06:15.231 --> 06:17.534
The lawyers told us not to discuss our testimonies,

06:17.569 --> 06:19.610
and I did send it to you, Ted. I remember.

06:19.645 --> 06:21.420
It was my first week here.

06:21.455 --> 06:23.132
It was my very first project.

06:23.502 --> 06:25.968
The very first DRAFT LINDA

06:26.641 --> 06:28.257
Hello. Linda, right?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.973
Yes, Mr. Crisp. Linda Zwordling.

06:31.008 --> 06:32.287
Please, call me Ted.

06:32.322 --> 06:33.935
Oh, and... you call me Linda.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.081
Oh, you already did. Then keep calling me Linda.

06:37.116 --> 06:38.497
And you keep calling me Ted,

06:38.532 --> 06:40.624
and together, we'll call each other by our names.

06:40.659 --> 06:42.959
It's just crazy enough to work.

06:43.843 --> 06:45.624
Oh God, that's not my laugh.

06:45.659 --> 06:47.414
I don't know where that came from.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.448
I'm just so excited to be here
and working for this company

06:50.458 --> 06:52.399
that does all these great things.

06:52.434 --> 06:55.153
You know, my cousin uses the
wheelchair you guys invented,

06:55.188 --> 06:56.528
the one that climbs stairs.

06:56.563 --> 06:58.618
You know it was my idea to give them brakes.

06:58.653 --> 07:01.259
You should have see those suckers rolling downstairs... 

07:01.294 --> 07:02.434
You're joking...

07:02.469 --> 07:04.549
with me... on my first day.

07:04.729 --> 07:06.416
I love this place.

07:06.649 --> 07:11.649
Oh, before I forget, we've been getting some unusuals
results on this perfume product I've been testing.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.139
Ted, can I speak to you a minute?
Sure.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.309
Have you met Linda?

07:15.344 --> 07:16.686
Yes. With a laugh.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.938
Don't worry. I'm working on a new one.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.285
That's not it. 

07:21.320 --> 07:23.084
Well, keep us posted.

07:23.119 --> 07:27.086
Oh, and if there something I should know about
the perfume results, just... send me an email.

07:27.121 --> 07:28.680
E-got it.

07:28.977 --> 07:31.527
You know what I'm doing? I'm trying too hard.

07:31.562 --> 07:34.578
A few minutes later, I sent you the e-mail.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.828
Yeah, well I believe that you believe you sent it

07:36.863 --> 07:39.621
but I know exactly where I was,
and I didn't get anyhing.

07:39.656 --> 07:41.203
How can you be so sure?

07:41.238 --> 07:44.409
For me it was memorable, because it
was my first week, and I was...

07:44.444 --> 07:46.394
field testing my laugh.

07:46.481 --> 07:48.429
For you, it was just another day.

07:48.464 --> 07:51.464
Well, I... I remember because...

07:52.197 --> 07:53.639
well, I just do.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.518
And if there something I should know about
the perfume results, just... send me an email.

07:57.662 --> 07:58.662
E-got it.

07:59.536 --> 08:01.986
You know what I'm doing? I'm trying too hard.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.189
I like that hairstyle.

08:05.224 --> 08:06.789
It's very powerful.

08:06.824 --> 08:09.233
Would you mind if I wear my haird like that?

08:09.268 --> 08:10.573
Of course not.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.633
Good. Then you can't anymore.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.476
The laughing girl whose hair I'm taking likes you.

08:20.511 --> 08:22.308
So, you wanted to talk to me?

08:22.620 --> 08:25.824
Right after the teleconference, France called. They're in.

08:25.859 --> 08:28.112
God, you're in your game this afternoon.

08:28.147 --> 08:29.181
You think?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.267
Cause I wasn't really feeling it.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.827
Ted, that was an excellent presentation.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.938
Everything you said, was just so...

08:35.972 --> 08:37.850
concise and exactly.

08:39.173 --> 08:40.977
I think you and I should have sex.

08:42.075 --> 08:43.144
If you want.

08:56.695 --> 09:00.294
How could you know where you were
at that exact moment six months ago?

09:00.304 --> 09:02.806
What you were doing that was so memorable?

09:03.405 --> 09:04.823
Well, I was...

09:05.254 --> 09:06.381
lying down.

09:06.745 --> 09:07.999
You were lying down?

09:08.034 --> 09:10.556
That's how you remember it so vividly?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.841
Yes, because...

09:12.455 --> 09:14.637
well the blood had rushed to my brain.

09:15.075 --> 09:16.470
Why are you being so weird?

09:16.505 --> 09:18.391
I'm not being weird. You're being weird.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.062
Oh, my god. You did get my e-mail and you're lying.

09:21.072 --> 09:23.807
That's what's happening. This is what Ted looks like when he lies.

09:23.817 --> 09:26.024
You think I'm lying? You think I'd lie to you?

09:26.034 --> 09:29.440
I think you'd do anything to protect
this company and its precious CEO.

09:29.475 --> 09:31.793
You're totally gay for this place.
Well, I'm not lying

09:31.803 --> 09:34.681
and I don't think bthe company did
anything wrong. So if that makes me gay,

09:34.691 --> 09:36.008
then I am gay.

09:37.923 --> 09:39.123
Oh, settle down.

09:48.801 --> 09:52.507
Linda's claim that she warned me and
the CEO about the faulting perfume

09:52.542 --> 09:54.880
anything is pretty frost between us.

09:55.515 --> 09:57.530
Hello, person who thinks I'm incompetent.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.965
Hello, person who thinks I'm lying.

10:00.424 --> 10:03.098
I am incompetent and a liar. I don't get a hello?

10:03.133 --> 10:05.608
<i> And Linda's statement did not just affect the two of us.</i>

10:05.643 --> 10:08.149
<i> It sent shock waves to the whole company.</i>

10:09.158 --> 10:13.217
<i>Our legal department was working aroud
the clock looking for a defense strategy.</i>

10:15.972 --> 10:20.822
<i>And our executives were workin
 equally hard to find a scapegoat.</i>

10:23.006 --> 10:26.215
<i> But it wasn't just Linda's deposition that was causing fall out.</i>

10:26.250 --> 10:28.419
You went to the university of Aruba?

10:29.072 --> 10:32.175
Where knowledge is king and clothing is optional.

10:32.210 --> 10:35.299
You lied to me. You said you wnet to MIT like I did.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.934
We even did this school beaver dance together, remember?

10:40.692 --> 10:42.392
Now it just seems stupid.

10:45.980 --> 10:49.730
My God. What else have you been lying to
me about? How can I trust you now?

10:49.765 --> 10:52.329
I bet you weren't even rescued  in Montana by Harrison Ford.

10:52.364 --> 10:54.464
No, that is true. I swear.

10:54.601 --> 10:59.151
I woke up next to a campfire with 
Indiana Jones making me bacon.

11:05.518 --> 11:06.968
Look, I'm sorry.

11:07.204 --> 11:09.941
I should have been honest with you, but
I had just started working here

11:09.975 --> 11:12.725
and I was afraid I'd get fired if anyone find out I lied.

11:12.821 --> 11:16.106
I know it was wrong, but it was so long ago.

11:21.470 --> 11:25.770
Too bad your first day at work has to be during sixties' week.

11:27.094 --> 11:30.444
So I heard you went to MIT. Me too.
Really?

11:30.839 --> 11:33.299
I guess I should have figured I'd run into another MIT graduate,

11:33.309 --> 11:35.291
here in the world of science.

11:36.044 --> 11:39.412
Now that we both went there, let's
promise never to talk about it again.

11:39.447 --> 11:40.648
Are you kidding?

11:40.683 --> 11:43.267
That's all we're gonna talk about. MIT was the best.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.652
The academic clubs, the dorms, the guys, the girl...

11:49.904 --> 11:51.304
You lied, Phil.

11:52.451 --> 11:55.101
And you know what we do at liars at MIT?

11:55.788 --> 11:57.038
No, you don't.

12:04.966 --> 12:09.182
The companies needs to protect its image and
we have a very interesting offer for you.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.000
<i> Phil and Lem's trust had been shattered</i>

12:11.035 --> 12:14.627
<i> but the company hadn't given up on trying to restore the public's trust.</i>

12:14.662 --> 12:17.194
They want me to be the scapegoat?

12:17.229 --> 12:20.999
We can't let the CEO take the blame, and you're the one who blurt.

12:21.034 --> 12:23.549
But I'm the only one who did the right thing.

12:23.584 --> 12:26.170
Well, you know how we call that? Irony.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.995
Now, here's how it's going to work.

12:29.484 --> 12:32.681
You say you knew the product was faulty but you didn't tell anyone

12:32.716 --> 12:36.866
and you made up that story about the e-mail
because... you have a drug problem.

12:37.313 --> 12:38.928
I don't have a drug problem.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.738
I haven't taken drugs since...

12:41.524 --> 12:44.697
Well, you don't need to know the last time I got high.

12:44.732 --> 12:46.823
The point is, I don't have a drug problem.

12:46.858 --> 12:49.435
But you don't need one. That's the beauty of this plan.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.395
Linda, why can't you ever trust the company?

12:52.430 --> 12:54.732
They know what they're doing.
They've done it before.

12:54.992 --> 12:56.646
It is all my fault.

12:56.681 --> 13:01.691
I knew that there was a problem with the sauce, but
I did not notified my superiors because well,

13:02.235 --> 13:05.566
I am a drug addict. My godness, how I love the drugs.

13:05.601 --> 13:08.254
I would take them at my house. I would take them with a mouse.

13:08.289 --> 13:09.889
With a mouse, people.

13:09.972 --> 13:11.722
Now, that's rock bottom.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.002
This way the company is protected;

13:15.037 --> 13:16.815
and if you agree to this,

13:16.850 --> 13:18.618
you'll be handsomely rewarded.
Didn't do it.

13:18.653 --> 13:21.487
You'll be send to the most beautiful rehab facility in the country.

13:21.522 --> 13:24.709
Didn't do it.
You'll get to meet movie stars, rock stars,

13:24.744 --> 13:27.347
and people famous just for going in and out of rehab.

13:27.382 --> 13:29.269
Didn't do it.
And when you get back,

13:29.304 --> 13:31.312
your job will be waiting for you,

13:31.347 --> 13:33.125
because you have a disease, Linda.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.993
A disease that makes you look weak and dirty,

13:36.028 --> 13:38.663
and us compassionate and forgiving.

13:39.173 --> 13:42.419
It's a win-win.
How is that a win for me?

13:42.454 --> 13:43.954
Shut ut junkie.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.009
<i> It wasn't surprising that the company
wanted Linda to be a scapegoat.</i>

13:48.044 --> 13:50.697
<i>The surprising thing was...
You accepted their offer?</i>

13:50.732 --> 13:52.371
You're gonna say it's all your fault?

13:52.406 --> 13:54.658
Yes. I'm gonna take the fall...

13:54.693 --> 13:56.890
and land on a giant pile of money.

13:56.943 --> 14:00.721
But you're not a drug addict. I've seen what
you make, you can't afford to be a drug addict.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.667
Well, that's all about to change.

14:02.702 --> 14:04.635
Linda, why are you doing this?

14:04.670 --> 14:06.051
Look at this place, Ted.

14:06.086 --> 14:09.388
they freeze an employee. They weaponize pumpkins.

14:09.452 --> 14:12.803
They took an innocent panda
and turned it into an assasin.

14:12.838 --> 14:16.414
When you work at a place like this, you
try to find one person you can trust,

14:16.449 --> 14:20.996
one person who see things the way you do and knows right from wrong.

14:21.031 --> 14:22.831
I thought I found him,

14:22.953 --> 14:27.449
but he sold his soul to the company, so why shouldn't I?

14:31.041 --> 14:33.691
I swear to God, I didn't get the e-mail.

14:42.079 --> 14:44.042
The company scheduled a press conference.

14:44.077 --> 14:46.264
As Linda's supervisor, would you be comfortable saying

14:46.299 --> 14:48.982
you caught her trying to sell the copier?

14:49.017 --> 14:50.267
She said she's okay with it.

14:50.576 --> 14:52.506
No, I am not gonna say this.

14:52.879 --> 14:54.893
Why must you always fight me?

14:55.504 --> 14:58.707
What are you doing anyway?
I'm looking for a record of Linda's e-mail.

14:58.742 --> 15:02.981
She said she sent it May 5.
May 5, May 35, what's the difference?

15:03.016 --> 15:06.462
Let it go. Let her take the deal and make some money.

15:06.497 --> 15:07.898
Don't you see what's happening?

15:07.933 --> 15:11.487
We are taking the only person here who
has never compromised her ideals and...

15:11.522 --> 15:13.856
and turning her into an ideal compromiser,

15:13.891 --> 15:16.353
and I don't mean an ideal compromiser,

15:16.388 --> 15:19.039
one who, all the other compromisers look up to.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.145
I understand context, Ted.

15:22.111 --> 15:24.011
She was our conscience.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.616
So now what are we gonna do?

15:26.845 --> 15:28.369
Gosh, you are right.

15:28.404 --> 15:32.459
How we ever make the fortune 500
list of the most moral companies?

15:32.494 --> 15:35.349
Oh, wait. They don't have that.

15:43.107 --> 15:45.027
Morning Lem.
Phillip.

15:48.451 --> 15:49.834
So,

15:49.869 --> 15:52.642
I've been thinking about our past, and how I...

15:52.677 --> 15:56.701
shammed to the waters of our friendship with fishcuts of dishonesty.

15:56.736 --> 15:59.297
And I've been thinking about how the shark of my loyalty

15:59.332 --> 16:02.294
gorges to the sinful entrails of your bloody lies.

16:02.369 --> 16:05.440
So we both saw that sharks special last night.

16:05.475 --> 16:09.425
Wasn't it great?
I was struck by their capacity for forgiveness.

16:09.682 --> 16:13.169
Their cold black eyes, so full of compassion.

16:14.663 --> 16:17.976
<i>What you're watching, is two scientists in their natural habitat,</i>

16:17.986 --> 16:21.858
<i> awkwardly circling each other as
they attempt to repair their friendship.</i>

16:21.893 --> 16:25.819
<i> This ritual allows Phil and Lem to
confront and resolve their problems,</i>

16:25.854 --> 16:28.948
<i> while staying within the safe confines of marine biology.</i>

16:28.983 --> 16:32.492
And that is why the otter will always be the jester of the sea.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.365
Agreed.

16:35.557 --> 16:37.835
I forgive you.
Thanks, Lem.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.822
I just wish... 

16:39.984 --> 16:44.586
I could forgive myself for lying to my
closest friend for the past ten years.

16:49.057 --> 16:51.519
Here. Maybe these will help.

16:52.338 --> 16:53.964
Look through my glasses.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.303
Look through my liying glasses.

16:59.341 --> 17:01.391
These are not prescription.

17:01.626 --> 17:03.429
These are just clear glass.

17:03.853 --> 17:07.146
When I first started working here,
I thought they'd make me look smarter.

17:07.181 --> 17:09.181
For the last ten years... I've been... 

17:09.454 --> 17:11.055
lying to you too.

17:12.279 --> 17:15.279
I always assume you had poor eye sight.

17:15.840 --> 17:20.040
You know, because you wore glasses.
I had the feeling that's what people were thinking.

17:20.782 --> 17:23.259
Just glad I don't have to wear these anymore.

17:23.294 --> 17:25.743
Still look smart without them, right?

17:28.423 --> 17:29.435
Phil?

18:02.426 --> 18:06.169
Ok, before you sign let me go over
the conditions with you once more.

18:06.204 --> 18:10.464
We've been through it three times, Veronica.
I am a scapegoat, not an actual goat.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.133
Linda, wait!

18:13.425 --> 18:15.135
I have to show you something.

18:15.411 --> 18:17.179
Go ahead, Angel junk.

18:18.591 --> 18:21.183
That's the street name we're giving you in the press release.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.371
Look, this explains everything.

18:31.605 --> 18:35.177
Security camera C. 5 May 2008.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.954
Wow, Ted, I know how babies are made,

18:37.989 --> 18:40.577
and I am so not in the mood for porn right now.

18:40.612 --> 18:41.954
Wait, let me zoom in.

18:41.989 --> 18:43.939
Yeah, that's gonna help.

18:45.528 --> 18:46.663
Oh, my God.

18:47.339 --> 18:49.050
Is that you and Veronica?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.877
Gross, why are you showing me this?

18:51.912 --> 18:54.612
What the hell is wrong with you?
Look at the date.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.843
It was May 5.

18:55.878 --> 18:59.655
This is right after we talked about
the perfume, this is what I was doing.

18:59.690 --> 19:02.490
I didn't want to tell you before because I didn't think it was... 

19:02.525 --> 19:05.225
relevant, but keep watching.
No!

19:05.554 --> 19:07.374
<i> You have new mail.</i>

19:07.409 --> 19:08.681
<i> Did you say something?</i>

19:08.716 --> 19:11.874
<i>No, the orientation's over. You're on your own now.</i>

19:11.909 --> 19:13.393
Now, look at the computer.

19:15.547 --> 19:16.990
There's your e-mail arriving.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.408
From: Linda Zwordling.
Email delete?

19:21.305 --> 19:22.953
Email removed.

19:23.349 --> 19:25.000
Veronica deleted it.

19:25.035 --> 19:26.737
She kicked the keyboard.

19:26.842 --> 19:28.830
While she was having her second ...
Allright Ted.

19:28.865 --> 19:30.544
I get it, you're a stud.

19:33.086 --> 19:35.132
So this is why you didn't see my e-mail.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.642
You were telling the truth .
We both were.

19:39.164 --> 19:41.132
I am sorry I doubted you.

19:41.167 --> 19:44.691
Yeah, what was with that?
Hey, you're the one that called me a liar.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.727
Yeah, well...

19:45.762 --> 19:50.412
I'm sure you've lied to someone about
something, so I'm just gonna call it even.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.801
<i>Wow, you should have a license for that thing.</i>

19:55.836 --> 19:57.136
That's it for me.

20:01.329 --> 20:03.639
You taped us having sex.

20:03.674 --> 20:05.408
You're kinkier than I thought you were.

20:05.443 --> 20:06.747
You have no idea.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.984
But I didn't tape us.

20:09.019 --> 20:12.261
I confiscated this a few months ago
from Dewey, the security guard.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.913
He had dozens of employees sex tapes like that.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.507
Dewey? Damn.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.805
That's the first person I ever met
named Dewey I thought he was normal.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.261
The quest continues.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.260
Anyway... 

20:23.295 --> 20:26.015
when you mentionned Linda sent the e-mail May 5,

20:26.050 --> 20:28.498
there was something about that date that ring a bell.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.421
Then I remembered that was the date on our tape,

20:31.456 --> 20:33.190
since I watched it several times.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.007
You've watched it several times?

20:35.042 --> 20:38.236
Well, if you don't study your performance
how do you expect to keep your edge?

20:39.672 --> 20:43.972
Well, I don't really look at it as a competion,
but whatever gets you there... 

20:45.393 --> 20:47.037
It was nice you did this for Linda.

20:47.072 --> 20:50.055
Well, her heart wasn't really in being a scapegoat.

20:50.090 --> 20:53.968
It just made more sense to give it to someone
who's gonna take the ball and run with it.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.885
I, Angel junk,

20:57.198 --> 21:01.760
am responsible for the hornets, the perfume, you name it.

21:02.025 --> 21:05.475
It was the drugs again. What can I say? I am weak.

21:05.522 --> 21:08.094
I would do it on the train, I would do it in the rain...

21:08.129 --> 21:11.491
In the rain people! Now that's messed up.
E just a desperate case.
