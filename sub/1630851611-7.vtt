11:02.749 --> 11:04.185
- Who's not pumped?

11:04.228 --> 11:06.187
Uncle Arjomand.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.841
- Oh, come on, guys.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.191
Haven't met
an uncle I couldn't schmooze.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.933
- Yeah, see, Amoo Arjomand--
he's like 400 years old.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.370
He's essentially unschmoozable.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.588
If he doesn't like you,

11:16.632 --> 11:19.113
he could have you kicked
out of the totem.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.244
- Is that legal?

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724

11:21.768 --> 11:23.726
the rules of the totem,
so, yeah.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.380
- Okay.
So what do I do?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.947
- Show him respect.
- Okay.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.731
- How much do you know
about Persian culture?

11:28.775 --> 11:29.776
- Full disclosure, eh.

11:29.819 --> 11:33.127
- Hello, Legends?
I'm parched.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.868
Can someone bring me
some water?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.739
Preferably sparkling?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.480
- Is that?
- Long story.

11:38.523 --> 11:42.092
Bishop dropped in
and--and hold up.

11:42.136 --> 11:45.400
This could be the perfect
ta'arof teachable moment.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.793
- What's ta'arof?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.882
- Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

11:48.925 --> 11:51.145
the heart of Persian etiquette
and hospitality.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.451
Having a guest in the house
is the perfect opportunity

11:53.495 --> 11:54.757
for you to learn all about it.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.716

will be just fine.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.108
Well, regular ice water

11:58.152 --> 12:00.110
with a pinch of salt
for electrolytes.

2-inch I-beams to you?

12:13.210 --> 12:14.690

20:45.635 --> 20:49.204
Sarah told me to tell you
that the Eagle has landed,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.597
which is secret code
for "Gary and Gwyn

20:50.640 --> 20:54.078

in the loading bay."

20:54.122 --> 20:55.819
Why do humans
have secrets anyway?

20:55.863 --> 20:57.691
- Because there are some things
people don't want

20:57.734 --> 21:00.433
everyone to know, and, judging
by these balance sheets,

21:00.476 --> 21:02.783
Mr. Staples had
about a thousand of them.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.916
If we're gonna divert
the injection molder

21:05.960 --> 21:08.528
to make our parts and still
deliver a plane in 48 hours,

21:08.571 --> 21:09.833

21:09.877 --> 21:12.488

running more efficiently.

over 50 different options,

21:17.493 --> 21:19.321
but perhaps
we should ask the ladies.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.108

21:24.152 --> 21:26.937
Starting today, we are
putting out a complaint box.

21:26.981 --> 21:30.593
Now, please don't hold back.
Help us help you.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.514
No one questions a work order
with his stamp.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.342
There was a chance to make
this factory better,

24:34.385 --> 24:36.344
so I took it.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.433
- You ordered the integration?

this country up.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.565
Without those women,
the plane won't get finished,

25:23.609 --> 25:28.701

25:28.744 --> 25:31.704

25:35.664 --> 25:37.927
