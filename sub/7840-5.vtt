01:19.044 --> 01:20.071
Bart, can we go

01:20.072 --> 01:21.172
to Banana Republic?

01:21.310 --> 01:22.516
There's a mannequin there

01:22.517 --> 01:23.852
I have a crush on.

01:23.898 --> 01:26.163
Milhouse, that is the most

01:26.164 --> 01:27.531
pathetic thing I ever....

01:28.552 --> 01:29.680
Oh, my God.

01:29.687 --> 01:31.480
She's beautiful.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.440
Bullies!

01:35.653 --> 01:36.130
Wait.

01:36.416 --> 01:37.508
They're employees.

01:37.609 --> 01:38.963
They have to be nice

01:38.968 --> 01:40.213
to us. Let's go.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.531
Oh, shoe-boy?

01:44.566 --> 01:46.230
I'm looking for something

01:46.236 --> 01:48.330
in a cross-trainer.

01:48.417 --> 01:50.680
What size do I smell like?

01:51.065 --> 01:52.943
You're dead, Simpson.

01:52.948 --> 01:54.102
Dude, don't lose it

01:54.107 --> 01:55.241
in the workplace.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.333
Wee already on thin ice

01:56.335 --> 01:57.790
with Mr. Friedman.

01:57.796 --> 01:59.572
The shoe size calibrator

01:59.578 --> 02:00.950
is for measuring feet

02:00.955 --> 02:02.642
and nothing else.

02:02.686 --> 02:03.660
Yes, Mr. Friedman.

02:03.728 --> 02:04.972
I'm sorry, Mr. Friedman.

02:05.046 --> 02:06.370
That tie really brings out

02:06.378 --> 02:07.573
your eyes, Mr. Friedman.

02:08.475 --> 02:10.023
You're lacing it wrong.

02:10.025 --> 02:11.473
I want it overy-undery,

02:11.475 --> 02:13.233
not undery-overy.

02:13.327 --> 02:14.451
Re-lace them all.

02:15.208 --> 02:15.843
No.

02:18.617 --> 02:19.832
Attention part-time

02:19.838 --> 02:21.463
sales representatives.

02:22.258 --> 02:23.861
I'm leaving this job to work

02:23.876 --> 02:25.130
at Jolly Tamale

02:25.136 --> 02:26.690
because the hours are better

02:26.697 --> 02:28.010
and my mom's really sick.

02:28.055 --> 02:28.880
When you leave,

02:28.895 --> 02:30.070
what happens to your rule

02:30.078 --> 02:31.762
about not whaling on customers?

02:31.768 --> 02:34.211
That rule leaves with me.

02:42.845 --> 02:44.432
THe sole provider

02:44.845 --> 02:45.243
join the army

02:45.327 --> 02:47.201
Idle teens at 1:00.

02:47.336 --> 02:47.860
Intercepting

02:47.867 --> 02:49.491
in three, two.

02:49.948 --> 02:50.901
'Sup, guys?

02:50.918 --> 02:52.650
Heard the new rap CD?

02:52.718 --> 02:53.450
Yo, I don't know

02:53.458 --> 02:54.351
what I dig more,

02:54.386 --> 02:55.392
hip-hop, krunk,

02:55.455 --> 02:56.952
or serving my country.

02:57.008 --> 02:58.793
Are you guys hitting on us?

02:58.815 --> 03:00.013
No, man, we just want

03:00.017 --> 03:00.493
to talk to you

03:00.508 --> 03:01.190
about something near

03:01.197 --> 03:02.210
and dear to us.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.390
What? Being gay?

03:03.516 --> 03:05.142
Close. The Army.

03:05.235 --> 03:06.263
Because of exciting

03:06.276 --> 03:07.031
current events,

03:07.036 --> 03:08.350
the Army needs new members.

03:08.357 --> 03:09.071
New members who want

03:09.087 --> 03:10.181
to earn money for college,

03:10.268 --> 03:11.540
and see a part of the world

03:11.545 --> 03:12.982
that tourists never go to.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.473
Doesn't the Army have to fight

03:14.488 --> 03:15.440
in wars?

03:16.406 --> 03:17.293
Not wars,

03:17.328 --> 03:18.631
global struggles.

03:18.636 --> 03:20.053
You guys like globes?

03:20.076 --> 03:21.552
Let's go, dudes.

03:24.597 --> 03:25.420
Damn it.

03:25.425 --> 03:26.183
Even the dumbest teenagers

03:26.186 --> 03:27.452
in the dumbest town

03:27.475 --> 03:28.262
in the dumbest state know

03:28.265 --> 03:29.503
better than to join the Army.

03:29.688 --> 03:31.020
Well, we'll just have

03:31.027 --> 03:31.800
to go younger.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.192
What's this assembly for?

03:36.195 --> 03:38.323
A surpriseDoodlebops concert?

03:38.386 --> 03:41.220
Standardized tests, standardizedtests, standardized tests.

03:41.618 --> 03:43.812
How many of youlike video games?

03:46.376 --> 03:48.410
Well, what if there wasa violent video game

03:48.465 --> 03:49.821
that you could play for free, 

03:49.888 --> 03:52.592
plus it's real lifeand not a game at all?

03:52.607 --> 03:54.103
Wouldn't that be slammin'?

03:54.107 --> 03:55.850
Who are these wonderful people?

03:55.855 --> 03:57.181
Now we broughtalong a movie.

03:57.206 --> 03:58.542
Do you guys knowwhere we can find

03:58.545 --> 04:00.613
some awesome kidsto show it to?

04:00.675 --> 04:02.020
Dearborn, Michigan?

04:02.088 --> 04:03.140
No, here.

04:03.186 --> 04:04.020
You got it.

04:17.016 --> 04:19.572
I'm  imagining that knight is me

04:34.547 --> 04:36.203
Ooh.

04:57.127 --> 04:58.082
The Army

04:58.207 --> 04:59.803
It's everything you like.

04:59.828 --> 05:01.152
Ah.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.522
Now you can't legally jointhe army until you're 18,

05:04.538 --> 05:07.712
but if you pre-enlist now,we will save you a spot

05:07.756 --> 05:10.493
in America's nextunresolvable conflict.

05:13.105 --> 05:16.283
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:18.225 --> 05:21.070
Listen to thosehalf-pencils scribble.

05:21.126 --> 05:22.942
Thanks  for fitting us in,Sergeant Skinner.

05:22.976 --> 05:25.152
Well, I'd do anythingfor my beloved Army.

05:25.238 --> 05:26.940
Well, how aboutre-enlisting?

05:26.965 --> 05:27.952
How about you bite me?

05:29.225 --> 05:30.502
Great news, Ma.

05:30.507 --> 05:32.723
I agreed to join the armywhen I turn 18.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.292
What? Homer!

05:36.406 --> 05:38.101
Our son joined the Army.

05:38.116 --> 05:41.210
Eh, big deal,by the time Bart's 18,

05:41.217 --> 05:43.010
we're going to controlthe world.

05:43.425 --> 05:44.333
We're China, right?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.293
Now listen, Bub.

05:46.298 --> 05:48.010
You go down to those recruiters

05:48.016 --> 05:50.680
and tell them Bart is too youngfor the Army.

05:50.747 --> 05:54.023
I don't want this to bethe only memory I have of him.

05:54.025 --> 05:56.941
How come I can't join the army,but Lisa gets to be in PETA?

05:56.947 --> 05:59.641
I think she just answerstheir phone.

06:00.537 --> 06:01.500
Hey.

06:02.535 --> 06:03.200
Uh...

06:04.245 --> 06:06.031
Fur is murder!

06:06.587 --> 06:08.110
When's the Krustymovie coming out?

06:08.165 --> 06:09.711
Whoa. Uh, hey.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.763
No, you can't.

06:10.856 --> 06:12.470
Uh, this one's ruined.

06:12.475 --> 06:13.623
Give me the backup.

06:16.746 --> 06:18.032
Now the babies.

06:21.826 --> 06:23.913
And the monkey head mittens.

06:25.668 --> 06:28.520
Yeah, I'm a real class act.

06:32.955 --> 06:34.053
Okay, Mr. Simpson,

06:34.056 --> 06:35.942
we'll tear up your son's contract.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.242
Sorry, guys.

06:37.308 --> 06:39.971
You know, his mother's the onewho made me come down here.

06:41.897 --> 06:44.123
Sounds, uh, likeyou're kind of tired

06:44.128 --> 06:45.350
of being bossedaround at home.

06:45.390 --> 06:46.380
Go on.

06:46.453 --> 06:48.100
Would you beinterested in, um...

06:48.216 --> 06:50.528
well, I don't know,joining the army?

06:50.729 --> 06:53.953
Wouldn't that take me away frommy family for two whole years?

06:53.955 --> 06:57.763
Hey, a big target like you will be home a lot sooner than that.

06:57.838 --> 06:59.320
Woo-hoo! Where do I sign?

07:00.858 --> 07:02.390
Now where's my parade?

07:03.276 --> 07:05.282
Where's my parade?

07:06.136 --> 07:08.640
We have this issue of Parade Magazine.

07:10.405 --> 07:12.821
Ooh, "Who makes what in America."

07:13.196 --> 07:16.412
Army private: $14,000 a year.D'oh!

07:21.756 --> 07:23.723
Homer, with all the things you've done--

07:23.756 --> 07:27.470
go into space, attendclown college, join the Navy--

07:27.475 --> 07:30.143
I never thoughtyou'd join the Army.

07:30.956 --> 07:34.280
Whoa, even the Armyhas Humvees now.

07:37.727 --> 07:40.043
Homie, don't do this.

07:40.046 --> 07:43.172
You have a wife and threeyoung children at home.

07:43.206 --> 07:44.400
I have to, Marge.

07:44.636 --> 07:47.673
Who else is gonna keep oil undera hundred dollars a barrel?

07:47.848 --> 07:49.841
You? Don't make me laugh.

07:52.748 --> 07:53.763
You couldn't...

07:53.816 --> 07:55.800
Aw, oh, oh, don't, no.

07:55.817 --> 07:57.573
Daddy's just teasing.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.801
Of course you could.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.781
You could keep itunder a hundred.

08:00.926 --> 08:02.142
Yes, you could.

08:02.336 --> 08:03.972
No,  she couldn't.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.963
Fort Clinton
(Not That Clinton)

08:12.737 --> 08:13.850
Attention!

08:13.858 --> 08:16.831
Ordinarily, I wouldspend the next two hours

08:16.845 --> 08:18.643
questioningyour sexuality,

08:18.648 --> 08:20.420
running down your hometowns,

08:20.428 --> 08:23.162
and telling you to drop andgive me various numbers.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.480
Are you gonna ask usour major malfunctions?

08:25.487 --> 08:27.463
'Cause mine isI care too much.

08:28.387 --> 08:32.063
Unfortunately, the demand fortroops has never been higher,

08:32.067 --> 08:33.970
so we've got to speed things up.

08:33.976 --> 08:36.480
While you've been standing here,your hair's been cut,

08:36.485 --> 08:37.971
and your clotheshave been replaced

08:37.977 --> 08:39.341
with army fatigues.

08:47.525 --> 08:50.022
Here's your nicknames:Brooklyn, Hollywood,

08:50.025 --> 08:52.250
Kissimmee-St. Cloud, Florida,Maveri,

08:52.258 --> 08:55.100
Blanket Hog, Newman's Own,Master of Suspense,

08:55.108 --> 08:57.351
England's Rose,Nickname Pending,

08:57.355 --> 08:59.921
Bram Stoker's Dracula,and Snowflake.

09:00.075 --> 09:00.863
Snowflake?

09:01.057 --> 09:02.860
What happens to me in the summer?

09:02.865 --> 09:04.271
A troublemaker, huh?!

09:04.376 --> 09:06.220
You're gonna sit here and eat donuts,

09:06.225 --> 09:08.693
while the rest of the unit does push-ups!

09:15.487 --> 09:16.511
I don't understand.

09:16.517 --> 09:19.052
How does punishing them teach me a lesson?

09:19.066 --> 09:22.012
Just for that, they'll do the push-ups one-handed,

09:22.016 --> 09:23.970
while you eat Alaskan King salmon

09:23.977 --> 09:25.923
and I give youa foot rub!

09:26.297 --> 09:28.230
I like rubbing people's feet

09:28.258 --> 09:30.182
Corns and bunionsare a treat

09:30.185 --> 09:32.120
can give massage real well

09:32.127 --> 09:34.181
If you know why,don't ask, don't tell.

09:36.298 --> 09:39.171
Congratulations, you have allcompleted basic training.

09:39.218 --> 09:41.802
Our base commander will now give you your assignments.

09:41.807 --> 09:43.241
Okay, listen up!

09:43.245 --> 09:45.593
Man, you've gotan awesome voice!

09:45.595 --> 09:46.761
Well, thank you.

09:46.765 --> 09:48.473
Can you say,"Side effects may include

09:48.475 --> 09:49.983
drowsiness and lossof appetite" ?

09:49.985 --> 09:53.080
Side effects may includedrowsiness and loss of appetite.

09:53.097 --> 09:54.940
Hmm, sounded better in my head

09:54.947 --> 09:57.202
Now, we've gradedyour aptitude tests

09:57.207 --> 10:00.883
and assigned you specialtiesto match your skills.

10:00.896 --> 10:01.871
Frontline infantry.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.821
Frtline infantry.Frontline infantry.

10:03.838 --> 10:04.792
Frontline infantry.

10:04.828 --> 10:06.960
I joined to makerecruitment films.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.320
Well, you knowwhere you're gonna get

10:08.326 --> 10:09.592
good footage, don't you?

10:09.606 --> 10:10.621
Ooh, tell me.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.262
Frontline infantry! 

10:15.297 --> 10:17.360
Everyone got an assignment but us.

10:17.828 --> 10:20.312
I wonder what makes us so special.

10:25.515 --> 10:27.042
Gentlemen, I'll be frank.

10:27.107 --> 10:30.101
Never before has the Army accepted recruits

10:30.147 --> 10:33.311
with test scores as low as yours.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.493
That's an odd way to start handing out medals.

10:35.498 --> 10:37.723
I'm not handing out medals!

10:37.807 --> 10:40.360
But I am gonna give youa special assignment.

10:40.366 --> 10:42.221
The  Army is conductingwar games,

10:42.228 --> 10:45.280
and we want youto play the enemy.

10:45.376 --> 10:46.632
Don't  you get it?

10:46.635 --> 10:50.800
They're using us as patsies to make the Army look good.

10:50.905 --> 10:52.412
Are we that stupid?

11:04.797 --> 11:08.423
- So they're not shipping you overseas?
- Nope.

11:08.507 --> 11:12.380
I'm gonna stay here and let them test
their laser-guided super weapons on me.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.402
Like that one.

11:16.106 --> 11:18.150
Don't worry, Dad.
You'll do great.

11:21.457 --> 11:24.200
Okay, these are war games,
and I'm head of my team.

11:24.256 --> 11:27.231
I have to think
like a great military leader.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.492
Ah, stay crunchy in milk.

11:31.405 --> 11:32.403
I will!

11:33.005 --> 11:36.501
Stay crunchy, men.
Stay crunchy.

11:39.165 --> 11:42.233
This'll be like shooting cats
off of Grandma's sofa.

11:43.257 --> 11:45.402
Oh, my God, I just remembered.

11:45.508 --> 11:47.602
It's Chinese New Year!

11:49.255 --> 11:51.631
Gung hay fat choi!
Gung hay fat choi!

11:55.428 --> 11:56.422
Americans!

12:05.456 --> 12:07.300
After them!

12:07.707 --> 12:10.853
Sir, you can't just invade an
American city without authorization.

12:10.935 --> 12:12.851
I sure as hell can!

12:12.906 --> 12:16.270
Congress slipped it into the
National Broccoli Day Proclamation.

12:16.525 --> 12:19.051
I was wondering why you
were carrying that thing around.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.452
I thought we were gonna have
a day off or something.

12:21.505 --> 12:22.503
Think again.

12:22.706 --> 12:24.002
Now, move out!

12:36.738 --> 12:39.352
- Is this war?
- No, sir, just a simulation.

12:42.608 --> 12:44.682
Whew, this pain feels so real.

12:44.886 --> 12:46.532
Uh, it is real.

12:46.705 --> 12:48.450
Oh. Guess I'd better
do my part.

12:58.406 --> 12:59.953
Bring it on, chumps!

13:01.005 --> 13:02.803
Fingers, fingers, fingers.

13:07.558 --> 13:10.103
What you doing, Moe?
Drawing a wangon Marmaduke?

13:10.208 --> 13:11.203
Heck, no.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.432
I'm challenging myself
with one of these, uh, Sudoku games.

13:14.486 --> 13:17.703
What, that Japanese puzzle
in which no numeral can be repeated

13:17.756 --> 13:19.272
in a row, column, or box?

13:19.378 --> 13:20.452
That's how it works?

13:20.558 --> 13:22.772
I was just drawing wangs on the numbers.

13:24.405 --> 13:27.251
Moe, Moe, you got to hide us
from the Army.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.080
The Salvation Army? You got it.

13:29.957 --> 13:32.250
Not that Army, the one from Stripes!

13:32.458 --> 13:33.452
Okay.

13:36.807 --> 13:38.952
Thanks, Moe.
How can I everre pay you?

13:39.005 --> 13:41.253
Hey, some things mean
more to me than money.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.300
Like a whole lot of money.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.641
Why did you just say
that sentence fragment?

13:46.645 --> 13:48.260
Uh, it, uh--long story.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.952
War game's over, losers.

14:00.615 --> 14:02.401
Hey, they's
using live ammo.

14:02.407 --> 14:03.872
Well, what have we got?

14:05.638 --> 14:06.862
Rise, my pretties.

14:06.917 --> 14:10.233
Find our mies and capture
their image in your filmy fortress.

14:13.358 --> 14:16.280
I think we ought to
just go up there and surrender.

14:16.336 --> 14:17.540
I'm not gonna surrender.

14:17.596 --> 14:19.802
You've seen what the US
Army does to prisoners.

14:19.905 --> 14:22.431
How would you like to
be stacked naked in a pile

14:22.486 --> 14:24.721
with a hillbilly girl pointing
at you and laughing?

14:24.826 --> 14:26.681
That was our last Christmas card.

14:29.057 --> 14:31.743
Yeah, Marge always loves your cards.

14:31.947 --> 14:34.971
Well, you may not be the
smartest guys in the Army.

14:40.786 --> 14:41.852
Homer Simpson!

14:41.956 --> 14:43.443
We have captured your unit!

14:43.445 --> 14:46.300
We're telling off-color jokes
and laughing as a group.

14:46.406 --> 14:48.280
Come and join the fun bunch.

14:50.008 --> 14:53.052
I'd give anything
to hear Homer's voice.

14:54.107 --> 14:55.680
"H" means "hot"?!

15:00.877 --> 15:02.853
Stupid Army,
searching for me

15:02.906 --> 15:05.430
with that giant helicopter
in the distance.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.470
It's not giant and
it's not in the distance.

15:08.678 --> 15:10.452
It's small and
it's in our room!

15:10.806 --> 15:12.001
Predator drone!

16:28.806 --> 16:29.952
This means war.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.941
- I thought it was already war.
- I hate you.

16:33.455 --> 16:36.103
Attention, Springfield!

16:36.207 --> 16:41.300
We are rounding up and detaining
all men who are fat or bald,

16:41.406 --> 16:45.401
or have ever been amused by
the antics of Homer Simpson.

16:45.455 --> 16:47.751
Excuse me.
I don't belong here.

16:47.808 --> 16:50.491
I am not bald.
I am balding!

16:50.596 --> 16:52.972
Ugh, why will no one honor the "-ding"?

16:53.276 --> 16:54.732
I honor the "-ding", sir.

16:54.736 --> 16:56.661
The hell are you
talking about?

16:59.458 --> 17:01.052
Sir, maybe we should just quit.

17:01.058 --> 17:04.642
This operation has cost
over $50 million since lunch.

17:04.698 --> 17:07.931
US government policy is very clear.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.450
Never back down.
Never admit a mistake.

17:10.557 --> 17:13.882
That's why we've won
over half the wars we've fought.

17:18.356 --> 17:20.970
Mom, we've got to stop
them from pacifying our town.

17:21.175 --> 17:22.991
Don't worry.
I have a secret weapon

17:22.998 --> 17:25.553
one more deadly than any gun.

17:25.656 --> 17:27.923
- Lisa's face?
- A phone tree.

17:28.125 --> 17:28.922
Huh?

17:29.125 --> 17:30.442
Well, you'd better hurry.

17:30.546 --> 17:33.302
I don't think Dad can last much
longer where he's hiding.

17:35.056 --> 17:39.673
Dorothy's daughter comes every Sunday
and brings all kinds of wonderful soups.

17:40.006 --> 17:43.323
- Oh...
- And Melvin's son brings a banjo.

17:43.378 --> 17:46.170
And he works our names into his songs.

17:46.177 --> 17:46.972
Oh...!

17:50.057 --> 17:50.900
Hello, Helen?

17:50.957 --> 17:53.972
I'm calling about the recent
destruction of our town.

17:54.077 --> 17:57.742
Well, I have a little
plan to fix their wagon.

18:00.957 --> 18:01.853
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:02.056 --> 18:02.853
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:03.056 --> 18:03.851
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:06.308 --> 18:07.800
Yes, Nelson,
of course I'll help.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.362
And a haw-haw to you.

18:09.885 --> 18:10.982
So that's the plan.

18:11.088 --> 18:14.171
We're meeting at the reservoir at 8:00 p.m.

18:14.538 --> 18:16.560
I flushed a potato down the toilet.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.633
Now we have to live in a hotel.

18:18.638 --> 18:21.002
Terrific.
Now call Lindsay Naegle.

18:26.385 --> 18:30.581
Marge, why did you have us
bring our liquor to the reservoir?

18:30.887 --> 18:34.222
We're going to dump it in
the water to get the Army drunk.

18:34.286 --> 18:35.221
Wow, uh...

18:35.228 --> 18:38.581
this'll be the first time
I ever watered down my booze.

18:39.426 --> 18:41.703
Moe, why are your eyes
darting back and forth so much?

18:41.707 --> 18:45.582
Oh, I-I'm just thinking about a
great tennis match I saw once, yeah.

18:45.686 --> 18:47.401
Uh, uh, now I'm thinking
about ping-pong.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.783
A... ver-very fast chess game.

18:51.038 --> 18:52.670
A... snappy David Mamet play.

18:58.855 --> 19:00.953
What the hell...happened to us?

19:01.257 --> 19:02.742
I'll tell youwhat happened to us.

19:02.948 --> 19:05.920
Y-You used to be cool and
then you got promoted.

19:05.987 --> 19:08.870
- I'm still cool.
- Oh, really?

19:08.877 --> 19:12.631
When's the last time we took the tank
and went down to Hansen's Point?

19:12.698 --> 19:13.831
Just the two of us?

19:13.935 --> 19:16.323
All right, all right, here's the plan.

19:16.527 --> 19:18.691
We're gonna take a li-little nap,

19:18.896 --> 19:22.152
and then we're gonna
wake up fresh as daisies.

19:28.215 --> 19:31.382
Colonel, we're here to discuss 
the terms of your surrender.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.680
Surrender?
Never.

19:34.085 --> 19:37.382
Hmm, let's see what your hangover has to say.

19:38.838 --> 19:41.551
Great Cheney's Ghost!
You win.

19:41.858 --> 19:44.831
Colonel, I hope you've learned
that an occupying foreign force

19:44.936 --> 19:47.491
can never defeat
a determined local populace.

19:47.595 --> 19:50.151
Among the many things
we learn Vietnam...

19:50.257 --> 19:51.252
Horn, please.

19:55.156 --> 19:57.930
Simpson,  you may have won,
but you still have to serve

19:57.998 --> 20:00.223
the remainder of your tour of duty.

20:00.295 --> 20:02.132
All right,but no combat.

20:02.637 --> 20:04.002
Don't you worry, ma'am.

20:04.208 --> 20:08.622
A man of your husband's ingenuity
can be put to very good use.

20:11.707 --> 20:12.573
Dudes.

20:12.677 --> 20:14.203
Want to make some extra spending money?

20:14.308 --> 20:15.651
Get a free pair of boots?

20:15.705 --> 20:18.451
Hey, baby,
you like obstacle courses?

20:18.855 --> 20:20.703
Thinking it over, huh?
I'm cool with that.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.330
Hey, pal, like the way
you handle that mop.

20:24.435 --> 20:25.333
You like killing?

20:25.535 --> 20:26.572
Hey, ladies.

20:26.607 --> 20:29.361
Are you tired of waiting
for sanctions to work?

20:29.368 --> 20:30.622
I know I am.
