doesn't mean I need to fight.

but if I was the last
person on earth,

38:00.528 --> 38:02.905
you would be happy
to (bleep) me.

38:02.989 --> 38:06.325
{\an1}Don't down me because
I don't want you.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.535
{\an3}(Kortni)
Exactly.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.536
{\an5}(Aimee)
You can't hurt my feelings
easily,

38:08.619 --> 38:11.747
{\an8}but Kirk and Codi,
they really did

38:11.831 --> 38:13.708
{\an8}make me feel
very self-conscious.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.918
Don't do me like that.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.045
{\an5}Did y'all
have fun tonight?

38:16.002 --> 38:18.045
I did.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.046
{\an5}(Gus)
I don't know, but I
know whose brother

38:19.130 --> 38:20.548
is smashing Nilsa tonight.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.675
{\an5}(Codi)
You know, Aimee told me
she would not (bleep) me.

38:22.758 --> 38:25.136
She said she wouldn't
(bleep) anybody in here--

38:25.219 --> 38:27.722
Jeremiah, Kirk, Gus--
she won't (bleep) nobody.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.808
{\an4}(Kirk)
That sounds good when
no one's trying you up.

38:30.891 --> 38:31.809
That's what I said.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.561
And, honestly,
I love her to death,

38:33.644 --> 38:34.812
{\an1}but, in reality, I wouldn't
even look at her twice.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.858
{\an4}Who?

38:34.895 --> 38:38.858
I wouldn't look
at her twice, either, but...

38:38.941 --> 38:40.192
{\an4}(Kirk)
I'm just saying,
you know, (bleep),

38:40.276 --> 38:42.236
{\an1}like, I know it sounds bad
and it sounds shallow,

38:42.319 --> 38:44.280
{\an1}but that's some real--
that's some real (bleep).

38:45.406 --> 38:48.868
{\an8}Right now, Kirk and Codi
are talking about Aimee

38:48.951 --> 38:50.911
{\an8}in a way
that's definitely rude.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.748
She's literally
right outside.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.250
{\an1}Honestly, I probably wouldn't
even look at her once.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.085
{\an5}(Codi)
I think she's got
a great personality.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.796
{\an5}That's what attracts me
to her, her personality.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.796
Same, 'cause we
got to know her.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.591
{\an1}But out, and I don't know that,
I'm not looking at you.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.760
{\an5}Yeah.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.760
Dude, you guys just need
to chill with that

39:05.843 --> 39:07.678
because it's cool to think that.
I understand that.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.555
We can all have our personal
opinions about that,

39:09.638 --> 39:11.599
but you don't say
that (bleep) out loud.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.850
You don't know if
she's (bleep) listening.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.019
I don't give a (bleep)
if she's listening or not.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.688
I told her in the cab ride
home. Kirk, did I not?

39:17.772 --> 39:20.274
{\an4}You did.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.274
And if she don't like it,
she don't like it.

39:20.357 --> 39:22.026
If somebody that
I'm not attracted to

39:22.109 --> 39:24.612
comes up to me in a bar and
says, "Hey, I'm feeling you,"

39:24.695 --> 39:26.489
I'm gonna be like...
I'm gonna be respectful.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.824
I'm not just gonna be like,
"Nah, you ugly."

39:28.908 --> 39:30.868
That's not what I'm gonna say.
I'll be like,

39:30.951 --> 39:31.869
{\an5}"Look, I'm not interested."

39:30.951 --> 39:31.869
You know what? Except
they're gonna say that.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.746
You said if you saw her
in the club,

39:33.829 --> 39:35.539
you wouldn't give her
a second look.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.625
{\an1}Yeah, that doesn't mean you're
gonna go to her, but, hey,

39:37.708 --> 39:38.793
{\an1}I'm not gonna give you
a second look and walk away.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.170
What the (bleep) are you
talking about right now?

39:41.253 --> 39:43.005
{\an5}Nobody's talking
about that at all.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.005
We're saying we're not gonna

39:43.089 --> 39:44.965
{\an1}put that situation in hand,
bro. What the (bleep)?

39:45.049 --> 39:46.050
I already said if
I was going to the club

39:46.133 --> 39:48.302
and I saw her,
I'm gonna talk to her.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.346
I'm gonna flirt with her,
but I'm not just gonna

39:50.429 --> 39:51.514
{\an1}walk into the place and say,
"Oh. Oh, my God.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.850
Damn. She's just
(bleep) amazing."

39:54.934 --> 39:58.479
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
This is really starting
to piss me off.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.565
Aimee's opened up to us about
being in a bad relationship

40:01.649 --> 40:04.068
from a man and told
that she doesn't look good.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.028
Why would you continue
to prod on that?

40:06.112 --> 40:08.531
It's as if Aimee needs more help
to (bleep) on herself.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.032
You weren't in
our (bleep) cab ride.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.284
She tried me and I
told her how it was.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.161
All I'm saying is,
he's saying (bleep) out loud.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.871
I'm saying it out loud
because if she

40:15.955 --> 40:17.498
walks in right here,
I'm gonna let her know...

40:17.581 --> 40:19.500
That's (bleep) rude to me.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.417
{\an5}(Codi)
Jeremiah thinks
he's so high and mighty

40:20.501 --> 40:22.211
{\an8}and I'm just...
I'm tired of it.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.754
{\an8}I'm just getting tired of it.

40:23.838 --> 40:26.048
Well, I'm gonna express
my opinion on the subject.

40:26.132 --> 40:29.218
{\an4}(Kirk)
Jeremiah, I love you to death.
I love you to death,

40:29.301 --> 40:30.886
but your opinion is not
always (bleep) right, bro.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.347
I'm not saying it's always
right. I'm trying to express--

40:33.431 --> 40:34.849
But you're making it seem
that (bleep) way, dawg.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.058
{\an5}You really are.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.058
You can keep (bleep)
raising your voice

40:36.142 --> 40:37.726
{\an5}all you want to me.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.726
I'm not raising my voice.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.853
I'm talking to you
like a grown man

40:38.936 --> 40:40.187
'cause you're
my (bleep) boy.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.398
{\an8}There's a lot of chaos
in the house right now.

40:42.481 --> 40:43.524
{\an8}There's been so much
yelling and screaming.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.360
{\an8}This could turn into
World War III.

40:46.443 --> 40:47.444
{\an8}You're just trying
to single me out

40:47.528 --> 40:48.821
{\an8}over some bull(bleep),
and I'm not--

40:48.904 --> 40:50.239
{\an8}I'm not gonna
listen to it.

40:50.322 --> 40:51.198
{\an8}I'm just expressing
my feelings on the subject.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.408
{\an8}I'm not gonna
listen to it.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.034
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep)
if she hears it or not.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.536
{\an7}Hey, it's over with.
It's over with.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.536
{\an5}I don't care.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.037
{\an7}It's over. It's over with.
It's over with.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.081
{\an8}You're not gonna (bleep)
talk school like that.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.834
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
I swear to God,
if he doesn't shut up,

41:01.917 --> 41:03.669
{\an8}I will freakin'
knock his ass out.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.713
{\an7}(Codi)
I'm sitting over here while
they (bleep) gang up on me,

41:05.796 --> 41:07.131
{\an7}and Jeremiah wants to
gang up on me. (Bleep) him.

41:07.214 --> 41:10.718
{\an8}We can talk outside.

41:07.214 --> 41:10.718
{\an8}Fine. I don't care.
You don't scare me.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.012
{\an8}Oh, my God, this is
getting out of hand.

41:13.095 --> 41:16.849
{\an8}♪♪

41:22.480 --> 41:25.566
{\an8}Can I take this off?

41:22.480 --> 41:25.566
{\an7}You can take it all off
if you want to.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.610
{\an8}Nilsa has a very attractive
friend named Katrina.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.571
{\an8}All right,
I'm gonna get a drink.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.072
{\an8}I can't even talk
right now. Bl-bl-bl...

41:34.783 --> 41:37.453
{\an7}'Cause that girl is crying
and I don't know why.

41:37.536 --> 41:38.621
{\an8}(crying)
