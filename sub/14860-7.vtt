00:02.503 --> 00:04.870
Penny, | know we've only
known each other a little while,

00:05.172 --> 00:06.333
and I know this is crazy.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.173
But...

00:09.468 --> 00:11.926
(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! (PANTS)

00:12.221 --> 00:13.006
Will you take this leap
with me?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.550
Of course I will.

00:15.849 --> 00:20.559
This is gonna be a perfect
marriage of adrenaline and danger.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.140
Now let's BASE jump.
Shall we?

00:22.439 --> 00:23.975
Okay!

00:24.274 --> 00:24.934
PENNY: Ooh, pretty.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.228
Okay.
All right.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.315
You ready?
Yeah.

00:30.614 --> 00:31.729
Yeah?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.615
BOTH: One, two, three!

00:34.910 --> 00:37.368
And I'm gonna
take the stairs!

00:37.663 --> 00:40.325
Oh, God, Penny. What
is the matter with you?

00:40.624 --> 00:43.867
You are so pathetic. It's like,
what are you so scared of?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.160
<i>Take a risk
for once in your... Whoa!</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:47.874
(SCREAMING)

00:48.173 --> 00:50.540
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Oh!

00:50.842 --> 00:52.424
Ow! Ow!
(MAX LAUGHING) Oh!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.255
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.011
Oh, no, oh, no.
What a schlemiel!

00:56.306 --> 00:58.343
| never get tired
of watching this!

00:58.642 --> 01:00.224
How did she manage to
fall around the landings?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.181
Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, you
know that I love a Penny pile-on

01:03.480 --> 01:05.596
as much as the next
slut. Oh, damn right.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.015
But that was a massive fall, and
we should all thank our lucky stars

01:08.318 --> 01:09.649
that Penny made it
out of there unscathed.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.481
Agreed.
Amen.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.317
PENNY: Uh, friendos? | did
not make it out unscathed.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.856
I'm extremely scathed.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.991
(IN STRAINED VOICE)
| know! (SQUEALS)

01:18.287 --> 01:19.743
Classic Penny! It was
the word! It was the word!

01:20.038 --> 01:20.948
BRAD: I'm sorry
but it's funny.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.864
Serious, though,
Dave and I have some big,

01:23.166 --> 01:24.873
potentially
earth-shattering news.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.500
Now, we don't wanna
freak anybody out. No.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.378
But, Alex and Dave

01:31.133 --> 01:32.248
are casually seeing
each other.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.508
Oh, we knew that.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.634
Gross. (SNOOTY VOICE) And
it's the least interesting pairing

01:35.929 --> 01:37.340
since chicken piscati
and pinot gris.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.346
What?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.927
(NORMAL VOICE) Sorry. I've
been watching a lot of Frasier.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.058
| know you're all
terrified right now,

01:43.353 --> 01:45.014
and clearly, that is why
you're lashing out at us,

01:45.314 --> 01:47.897
but don't worry. We're not
gonna let this thing get too serious,

01:48.191 --> 01:51.149
because Alex and Dave,
much like Dave's new haircut,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.435
are keeping it cazsh.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.524
Oy vey.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.609
Trust us, the last thing we want
is for things to get complicated

01:56.908 --> 01:58.319
like in It's Complicated.
Oh.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.700
So we're just gonna go
with it, like in Just Go with It.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.906
And be friends with benefits
like in No Strings Attached.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.788
Guys, could the focus
please be back on me, okay?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.665
And could someone put
this chip in my chip hole?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.951
I'm so hungry.
No, Max, don't do it.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.871
(PENNY SCREAMING ON

02:12.174 --> 02:13.414

02:13.717 --> 02:14.548
Okay, laugh it up.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.833
It's like a slinky
with breasts.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.626
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

02:17.929 --> 02:20.671
You guys, not cool. | died for
two minutes in the ambulance.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.549
What?

02:33.904 --> 02:35.815
(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

02:38.033 --> 02:41.617
Wow. Babe, I am loving you
in that robe.

02:41.912 --> 02:45.371
You look so happy
and so relaxed.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.031
Thanks, byabe.
You were right.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.075
Getting laid off has been
really good for me.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.584
| mean, it was
a little weird at first,

02:50.879 --> 02:51.869
because I've basically
had a job

02:52.172 --> 02:53.333
since I was in, like,
seventh grade.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.248
Well, now you can
finally take a break,

02:55.550 --> 02:56.961
and you can start working
on those hobbies

02:57.260 --> 02:58.170
that you've been
putting off forever. Right?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.881
Like your dance-cooking.
Mmm!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.591
And your candle making. Mmm-hmm.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.302
And I know you
didn't forget about

03:04.601 --> 03:05.887
this guy!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.472

What's up, my dude?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.104

Oh, no, you didn't!

so fat, she died.

03:17.280 --> 03:17.985
(LAUGHS)

03:20.784 --> 03:21.945
(NORMAL VOICE)
Sorry, I...

03:22.244 --> 03:23.905
That was just sad more
than anything. Yeah.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.490
Yeah, I need to practice.
It's a little rusty. It's pretty sad.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.281
Yeah, but you know what
the best part of all of this is?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.995
Hmm? Is that we've been
able to hang out so much more.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.160
| mean, I have been coming
so hard home from work

03:33.463 --> 03:35.625
just 'cause I'm excited
to have dinner with you.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.210
| mean, when you were
working, we hardly spent

03:37.509 --> 03:39.216
any time together,
and I know this is crazy,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.629
but I was scared that
eventually we were gonna turn

03:42.931 --> 03:45.548
into one of those couples that just
slowly drifts away from each other.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.092
Babe, that will
never be us, okay?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.432
Now you go to work and make
that money for Papa. Yeah.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.017
All right? Mmm.
Mmm.

about me. Mmm! Mmm?

Spank it.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.738

Ah! Man,

04:21.261 --> 04:22.626
Fluorescent lights,
stale coffee,

04:22.929 --> 04:25.091

quoting classic comedies.

Yo, Williams!
You my boy, blue!

04:27.184 --> 04:30.393

for me, which is nice. Okay.

Ah. Daddy's home.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.606
Huh!

04:39.905 --> 04:41.737
So I was thinking about it,

04:42.032 --> 04:44.899
and I think you and Dave casually
dating is actually a great idea.

04:45.202 --> 04:49.036
Yo, yo!
Here's your drink, friend.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.323

Bromaine lettuce.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.707
So what's the damage
on my bevvy?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.538
We go Dutch.
It's more cazsh.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.123
Actually,
the drinks were free.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.459
That bartendress over there
was flirting with me,

04:59.758 --> 05:01.999
but I did not flirt back.
| swear, dawg.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.631
Oh. Well...

05:05.931 --> 05:07.262
Uh, you know what?
It's totally cool,

05:07.557 --> 05:10.424
Because... (SCOFFS)

keeping it cazsh.

Well, I'm out!

05:23.031 --> 05:24.487
You two have fun

05:24.783 --> 05:26.615
talking like two
of Scott Caan's groomsmen.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.991
Yeah.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.328
So, what do you
wanna do now?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.660
Mmm, I don't know.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.165
What do two pals do
on a Tuesday afternoon?

casual sex ever! Totally.

Okay, I'm coming.

Mmm-hmm.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.051
Al right.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.966
Ooh!

05:52.269 --> 05:56.354
We have your hot
but not too hot tea,

05:56.648 --> 05:58.389
your cool
but not too cool pillow.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.807
Oh! (CHUCKLES)
And...

06:00.110 --> 06:01.817
a crustless sando
for baby.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.194
Aw, you're so sweet for
taking care of me, Max.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.196
(GROANS)

06:06.491 --> 06:07.947
Ooh,
| hate to be this girl,

06:08.243 --> 06:11.531
but I do see some residual
crust on that sandwich.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.242
And I thought that I'd made
myself pretty crystal clear

06:14.541 --> 06:17.283
when I told you I wanted zero crust
whatsoever 'cause it hurts my teeth.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.076
Did you not feel
| was clear?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.165
No, I felt you were
very clear. Okay.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.421
I'm just gonna remove
the crust. Thank you.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.458
And here we go.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.921
Okay. (GROANS)

06:27.220 --> 06:29.461
Oh, there's no crust
on this sandwich.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.346
But all your chitchatting
has left my tea cold.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.218

06:35.520 --> 06:38.012
| have been busting my humps
being your male nurse,

06:38.315 --> 06:42.104
because I genuinely
love these gift baskets.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.313
And to a lesser extent, you, you
know, "cause we're best friends

06:44.613 --> 06:45.728
and we love each other
and all that barf,

06:46.031 --> 06:47.567
but you are
the worst patient ever.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.450
So if you will excuse me,
I'm taking this gift basket

06:51.745 --> 06:53.577
and this gift basket
with the salami,

06:53.872 --> 06:56.330
and you are coming
with me. This is rich!

06:56.625 --> 06:58.662

Good day, sir!

Hey, you.

I'm Kent. Uh, Penny's
new physical therapist?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.842
Oh, yeah.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.631
Hey, you brought her some
gift baskets. What a good friend.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.221
Ugh!

07:16.519 --> 07:18.226
Well, two things you
should know about me, Kent.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.263
I'm selfless
and have moves like Jagger,

07:21.566 --> 07:24.228
specifically the ones he allegedly
used on David Bowie in the 70's.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.187
Huh.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.777
Whoal! Al,
what is with this outfit?

07:31.076 --> 07:32.987
You look like the Olsen Twins'
burnout brother, Larry Kate Olsen.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.778
Come on. His middle name
is also Kate?

07:36.081 --> 07:36.866
You're obviously
dressed like this

07:37.165 --> 07:38.747
because you slept
at Dave's,

07:39.042 --> 07:41.329
and you like wearing his clothes,
which is the opposite of casual.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.086
You, sister, are in a serious
relationship. (WHISPERS)

07:44.381 --> 07:47.373
What? No, his shirts
are just comfy, okay?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.212
We're totally cazsh.
We slept head-to-toe.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.003
It doesn't count.
(CHUCKLES) It counts.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.761
I'll tell you
what doesn't count.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.014
The Miami Heat's
most recent NBA Championship.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.095
It was an injury-plagued,
strike-shortened season.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.510
Therefore, LeBron
still needs six rings

07:59.813 --> 08:01.269
to even get in the
conversation with Jordan.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.475
Are you done?
No.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.890
Also, Chris Bosh looks like one of
Omar's boyfriends from The Wire.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.729
Whatever, Jane, okay?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.941
Dave and Alex are not
serious, okay? Mmm.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.073
In fact, would someone
in a serious relationship

08:13.368 --> 08:15.484
ask this smoking hot
bartendress for her number

08:15.787 --> 08:17.573
so that her and Dave
could go out on a date?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.112
| don't know what you're...
That makes no sense.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.406
Well, watch me.

give me your digits, he'll hit you up.

(GASPS) If that's the doctor,
will you ask if I can still

08:43.690 --> 08:45.397
get out of this cast
tomorrow? Yeah.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.557
Hey, Doc.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.853

08:57.037 --> 08:59.699
Penny's actually
in Bolivia.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.490
Turns out a body cast is
perfect for narcotraficante.

I'll hit you up if she
makes it out the game.

have to be in that cast

another week.

to get a lot sookier.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.049
Doc prescribed double the

No, no, no, no.
And, Kent?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.091

gonna have to start showing up here

McMahon jersey from now on.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.720

09:39.496 --> 09:40.702
which is how SinBrad
says "good"

09:40.997 --> 09:43.034

a 90's sensibility.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.908
(SCOFFS) No. Why are you
using a travel agent?

people still used travel agents.

if this would be weird,

17:46.732 --> 17:49.770
but maybe you wanna go
get a drink sometime?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.482
Yeah, I'd like that. Call me,
and... and tell Penny I say hey.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.021
Yeah.
Tell her yourself!

17:55.741 --> 17:56.651
Penny?

17:56.951 --> 17:58.487
Max is a complete phony.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.322
He has been
misery-ing me.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.861
He lied about
my doctor's appointment,

18:02.164 --> 18:04.030
then he drugged me
to be alone with you.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.744
Then I escaped.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.159
Then I got caught
in this gate, peed on,

18:08.462 --> 18:10.328
and grafittied
by a bunch of kids,

18:10.631 --> 18:12.588
although on the plus side, |
seriously think this might be a banksy.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.880
Max, is this true?

18:16.178 --> 18:18.215
Yes, but, Kent,
... I did it for us.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.006
When we're together and we're
looking into each other's faces...

18:21.309 --> 18:22.925
You know what? Forget it. I'm a
skeeze. Get the hell out of here.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.605
You wanna get a calzone?

18:28.899 --> 18:29.513
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.184
Please, Pen, I'm sorry.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.352
It's just,
I'm boy-crazy right now.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.271
You know what that's like. You
would've done the same thing to me.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.690
What? I would never...

18:38.993 --> 18:41.576
Oh! I actually did do
the same thing to you.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.456
Tell him yourself!

18:46.751 --> 18:49.209
Wow. We really are perfect
for each other.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.128
You sure you're gay?

18:52.423 --> 18:55.006
You tell me. Right now, I'm writing
a Hot in Cleveland spec script,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.258
and I just had sex with Kent
in your powder room, so...

18:57.553 --> 18:59.510
All the best ones are gay.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.421
Or dating your friend.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.886
Zip it. I thought we were never
gonna talk about my whole Dave thing.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.017
| don't even feel that way
about him anymore.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.428
Although if Alex were to, say,
move away or become dead

19:08.731 --> 19:10.642
and asked me to marry him
in her absence,

19:10.941 --> 19:13.023
| would certainly consider it for
her sake and for Dave's sake, but...

19:13.319 --> 19:15.526
| was talking about this
hot guy Gregg that I met

19:15.821 --> 19:16.936
who's now dating
my friend Tim.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.651
Oh. Me, too.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.486
Sure, you are.
Come here.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.238
Bring it in.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.949
Can't do anything
but bring it in. I'm here.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.667
Brad, shouldn't you be
getting ready for work?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.873
Or do you have your suit on
under your robe? Huh?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.164
Jane, I am really sorry
that I lied.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.255
Whatever. I don't wanna hear
another word from you.

19:39.553 --> 19:44.263
(DEEP VOICE) What about from
me, baby girl? (GASPS) Ahem.

19:44.558 --> 19:48.643
Come on, skinny stack.
Brad's sorry. Hear the man out.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.350
Oh, you have gotten really
good at that. (WHISPERS) I know.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.560
(NORMAL VOICE) Babe, you were
right about me needing some time off,

19:53.859 --> 19:55.645
so I quit that job.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.276
Really?
Yeah.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.061
Look, job or no job,

19:59.365 --> 20:02.073
| Just, I want you to do
what's gonna make you happy.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.110
| know. But listen,
spending all this time

20:05.413 --> 20:08.121
working with SinBrad has
made me realize something.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.076
He's more than
just a dummy.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.365
Oh.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.205
He's the perfect
metaphor for my life.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.622
You see, SinBrad is me,
and my job is my hand.

20:16.924 --> 20:17.584
Wait.
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:17.883 --> 20:19.624
Not your best.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.170
But I am done letting
work control me, okay?

20:23.472 --> 20:26.385
We'll never drift apart.
My byabe.

can't have none.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.186
Mmm! Mmm!

20:36.485 --> 20:37.975
Oh! Brad, you can leave.
