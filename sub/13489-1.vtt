00:41.607 --> 00:42.974
Oh!

00:51.417 --> 00:52.951
<i>Though we have Faith</i>

00:53.018 --> 00:54.752
<i>And reasonable hope</i>
<i>for forgiveness,</i>

00:54.820 --> 00:56.321
<i>We must each face the fact</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:59.857
<i>That our actions create</i>
<i>a banquet of consequences.</i>

01:01.461 --> 01:04.796
<i>In your case you may think</i>
<i>this is a mean supper,</i>

01:04.863 --> 01:07.099
<i>But you chose it.</i>

01:08.134 --> 01:11.570
<i>If your mother were alive,</i>

01:11.637 --> 01:13.838
<i>She'd think this is best.</i>

01:15.308 --> 01:17.542
<i>Whatever father said to you,</i>
<i>don't take it to heart.</i>

01:17.610 --> 01:19.344
<i>Kent and I have</i>
<i>a little present for you</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:21.413
<i>For later.</i>

01:23.716 --> 01:25.883
<i>You'll be late</i>
<i>for the train.</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:19.871
Colorado springs!

02:19.938 --> 02:23.408
All aboard for Denver.
Colorado springs here.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.611
If you're traveling out
of town, have tickets...

02:28.947 --> 02:31.650
Chicago what?

02:33.786 --> 02:35.787
Hi!

02:45.498 --> 02:46.731
Watch your
step, miss.

02:46.799 --> 02:47.899
Thank you.

02:47.966 --> 02:49.234
There you go.

02:49.302 --> 02:52.571
Olivia?

02:52.638 --> 02:54.739
Take care, buddy.

02:56.842 --> 02:58.142
I'm reverend case.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.444
Hello.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.080
My dear, you look
just like your mother.

03:02.147 --> 03:04.316
I was so sorry
to hear she passed away.

03:04.383 --> 03:05.450
Thank you.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.118
Oh, is this it?

03:07.186 --> 03:09.287
For now, yes.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.360
Well, we have quite
a little drive ahead of us.

03:15.428 --> 03:16.794
Do you need

03:16.862 --> 03:18.796
To use the station services?

03:18.864 --> 03:20.164
Yes, please.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.966
Pardon me.

03:43.589 --> 03:45.557
Out here
they grow mostly grains,

03:45.625 --> 03:46.991
A bit of sugar beets

03:47.059 --> 03:50.295
And vegetables.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.564
No gasoline shortage
for farmers.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.032
They get all
they want.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.569
No sugar
shortage, either.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.305
That's nice.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.542
You must be Olivia.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.243
Yes, ma'am.
How do you do?

04:39.312 --> 04:41.879
Mr. Singleton's in the parlor.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.860
Mr. Ray Singleton,

04:55.928 --> 04:58.430
This is miss Olivia Dunne.

04:59.965 --> 05:02.500
Livy. Everyone calls me Livy.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.871
Ray's sister's waiting
in the church.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.241
Well, we'll just
leave you two

05:10.309 --> 05:12.811
To get acquainted a moment.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.983
Raymond, why don't you pour

05:19.051 --> 05:20.485
Some lemonade
for Livy?

05:20.553 --> 05:21.720
Yes, ma'am.

05:21.787 --> 05:23.287
We'll be in the church

05:23.356 --> 05:24.356
When you're ready.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.016
Thank you.

06:00.459 --> 06:01.893
Mr. Singleton...

06:01.960 --> 06:04.529
Ray... Please.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.298
Ray.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.367
Uh...

06:10.669 --> 06:12.837
Now that you've had a Chance
to meet me,

06:12.905 --> 06:16.073
To see me in person,

06:16.141 --> 06:18.242
Do you have any doubts?

06:18.310 --> 06:20.545
N-no, ma'am.

06:23.248 --> 06:24.416
Are you, uh...

06:26.952 --> 06:28.920
Are you having second thoughts?

06:28.987 --> 06:30.422
No.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.895
Do you think
you'll be able to love the baby?

06:36.962 --> 06:38.897
Oh, I do.

06:47.139 --> 06:49.974
Is there anything
that you'd like to ask me?

06:50.042 --> 06:52.811
No.

07:00.218 --> 07:02.253
You're so fine,
I can't believe no man...

07:03.923 --> 07:06.390
I can't believe any man
would ever do this to you.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.163
And do you, Raymond, take Olivia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

07:12.230 --> 07:13.331
I do.

07:13.398 --> 07:14.632
The rings?

07:16.802 --> 07:18.503
Uh, I didn't...

07:19.872 --> 07:21.072
I don't
have a ring.

07:21.139 --> 07:22.406
I don't,
I don't need one...

07:25.377 --> 07:26.377
Fine.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.279
Bound by these sacred bonds,

07:28.347 --> 07:32.083
May you vow to imitate Christ
in your new life together.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.719
To give one another hope
when there is sorrow,

07:34.787 --> 07:37.489
Strength when there is weakness,

07:37.556 --> 07:38.656
Faith and understanding

07:38.724 --> 07:40.324
When there is confusion
or doubt.

07:40.392 --> 07:43.995
In such a love, we are sustained
on this earthly life,

07:44.062 --> 07:46.564
Just as we hope for
eternal life through our

07:46.632 --> 07:47.999
Savior, Jesus Christ.

07:48.066 --> 07:49.400
Amen.

07:49.468 --> 07:53.170
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

07:59.444 --> 08:02.547
Martha, hank,

08:02.615 --> 08:04.782
If you'd please sign
as witnesses.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.555
Congratulations, Ray.

08:16.361 --> 08:17.962
Thank you.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.365
I'm Martha.
I'm Ray's sister.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.234
Pleased to meet you.

08:23.301 --> 08:24.536
This is my husband, hank.

08:24.603 --> 08:25.870
Hi. Nice
to meet you.

08:25.938 --> 08:26.938
Nice to meet you.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.406
Congratulations, Ray.

08:28.473 --> 08:31.009
We hesitated
to bring the children today.

08:31.076 --> 08:34.311
Thought we'd give you a Chance
to settle in, and...

08:34.379 --> 08:36.080
Oh, Ray, hold on.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.217
Just a sec.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.086
This is a little
casserole for supper.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.421
I thought you
must be tired

08:43.488 --> 08:44.622
From all your
traveling.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.624
Thank you.
That's very thoughtful.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.992
Now, Ray, you
bring Olivia over

08:48.060 --> 08:50.795
To see us real
soon, okay?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.363
Well,

08:52.431 --> 08:54.465
Welcome to
the family, huh?

09:11.349 --> 09:13.317
Who are your neighbors?

09:13.385 --> 09:14.786
Hmm?

09:14.853 --> 09:17.055
Your neighbors-- who are they?

09:19.692 --> 09:21.292
Uh, well, my sister.

09:23.228 --> 09:25.496
She and hank live eight Miles
thataway.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.070
Here.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.605
Thank you.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.209
Is that garden your mother's?

10:12.277 --> 10:14.411
Uh, yes it was.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.815
Someone sounds unhappy.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.183
Uh, it's just the dog.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.452
I put him in the shed
so he won't jump on you.

10:32.998 --> 10:34.231
Thank you.

10:34.299 --> 10:36.668
Uh...

10:36.735 --> 10:38.235
Welcome home.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.057
Kitchen's there.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.112
There some, uh,
coca-colas in here.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.014
No, thank you.

11:44.469 --> 11:47.304
Uh, this was
Martha's room,

11:47.372 --> 11:50.908
And... Um...

12:00.385 --> 12:04.021
This was my parents' room
where you'll be staying.

12:04.089 --> 12:05.990
Will this be all right?

12:06.058 --> 12:08.325
Mm-hmm.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.797
Uh, let's see...

12:14.800 --> 12:16.801
This is the
bunk room.

12:22.207 --> 12:23.707
You have a brother?

12:23.776 --> 12:25.342
Well, I do.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.011
Well, I did.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.913
Daniel got killed
at pearl harbor.

12:32.617 --> 12:33.985
This is the bathroom.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.455
Indoor plumbing.

12:38.523 --> 12:39.791
Got your hot water,

12:39.858 --> 12:42.459
Cold water.

12:42.527 --> 12:44.495
I just put that in.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.134
Where's the telephone?

12:50.202 --> 12:53.204
Well, there's
a phone box in Wilson,

12:53.272 --> 12:55.306
Outside the post office.

13:11.589 --> 13:16.027
Tomorrow I'll get anything
you want to stock the kitchen.

13:16.094 --> 13:17.962
I don't really
know how to cook.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.498
I mean I could;
I just haven't really tried.

13:21.566 --> 13:24.101
I can cook a fair bit.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.672
My sister could
come over and teach you.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.275
No, it's fine, you know,
it shouldn't be that hard.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.178
I can get a book
from the library.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.617
Is there a library?

13:40.685 --> 13:42.119
Oh, yeah, in la junta.

13:44.089 --> 13:45.723
That's an hour away.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.258
Yeah, about that.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.137
The reverend said
you'd had lots of schooling.

14:00.205 --> 14:02.706
I was in
graduate school,

14:02.774 --> 14:04.641
Studying
archeology.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.110
My college thesis

14:06.178 --> 14:09.247
Was Heinrich Schliemann's
excavation of Troy.

14:09.314 --> 14:11.282
Is he German?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.683
Yes.

14:12.751 --> 14:13.918
Is he a Nazi?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.653
No, he... He lived
in the 19th century.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.168
Oh, I can...
No, sit.

14:33.805 --> 14:35.806
Uh, Mrs. Pratt,

14:35.874 --> 14:37.942
From church, she, uh,

14:38.010 --> 14:41.112
She makes me a cake
nearly every week.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.918
This one's, uh...
Chocolate, I think.

14:46.985 --> 14:48.252
Yeah.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.187
Can I cut you a slice?

14:50.255 --> 14:51.989
No, thank you.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.393
We'll save it, then.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.763
Ray...

15:01.833 --> 15:02.934
Um...

15:03.001 --> 15:07.771
I was just wondering...

15:07.839 --> 15:10.641
Why you agreed to this.

15:13.445 --> 15:16.347
When the reverend
come out to see me

15:16.415 --> 15:18.615
And told me about
your situation...

15:20.986 --> 15:24.588
Well, I thought...

15:24.656 --> 15:26.958
I thought...

15:27.025 --> 15:30.061
Maybe it'd be God's will.

15:30.128 --> 15:33.130
God's will.

15:37.235 --> 15:38.502
You want anything else?

15:38.570 --> 15:41.172
No, thank you.

15:41.239 --> 15:44.641
Farmers get to bed early.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.210
You have everything you need?

15:46.278 --> 15:49.080
Yes. Thank you.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.315
All right.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.884
Good night.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.786
Good night.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.073
Oh...

19:43.181 --> 19:44.781
Good morning.

19:44.849 --> 19:47.551
Morning.

19:47.618 --> 19:49.920
I can't believe
I slept so late.

19:49.987 --> 19:50.954
You needed
your rest.

19:52.723 --> 19:55.059
Franklin!
No. Hey.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.327
Come here.
Come here.

19:57.395 --> 19:58.662
He won't hurt you.

19:58.729 --> 20:00.097
Good boy.

20:00.165 --> 20:03.567
I thought I'd drive
into la junta today.

20:03.634 --> 20:04.734
Um, maybe look
around town.

20:04.802 --> 20:06.570
Let the family know
that I'm here.

20:06.637 --> 20:07.971
Could I borrow the truck?

20:08.039 --> 20:12.008
Oh, well, uh, the beet box
has a mind of its own.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.477
The beet box.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.679
I use that truck
to haul my beets.

20:15.746 --> 20:16.680
Right.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.449
It's best if
I drive you over.

20:18.516 --> 20:21.585
Oh, I'm... I'm sure you have
things you need to do.

20:21.652 --> 20:23.253
No bother.
I'm glad to do it.

20:23.321 --> 20:25.422
Just, uh, get my library card,

20:25.490 --> 20:28.158
In case you want
to check out some cookbooks.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.636
Are those tomatoes?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.574
Potatoes.

20:47.078 --> 20:48.912
Some of the fields are empty.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.180
You bet.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.317
Why?

20:53.384 --> 20:55.952
Well, we harvested
the first cash crop.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.421
Winter wheat.

20:57.489 --> 21:01.458
Next we'll harvest them
beets and those potatoes.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.227
May I help?

21:03.294 --> 21:06.630
I doubt it.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.134
You're right.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.102
I... I don't know anything
about farming.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.774
You got the house
to take care of.

21:39.297 --> 21:40.830
You need any change?

21:40.898 --> 21:43.099
Uh, no, I have it.
Thank you.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.536
I'll be
in the library.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.025
Are you expecting a little one?

22:09.093 --> 22:10.394
Yes, ma'am,
we are.

22:10.461 --> 22:11.195
Well, how wonderful.

22:11.262 --> 22:12.329
Yes, ma'am.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.305
Do you have any books
on Henry Schliemann?

22:21.372 --> 22:22.906
Is that s-h or s-c-h?

22:22.973 --> 22:24.774
Well, your guess
is better than mine.

22:24.842 --> 22:26.577
I think he was an archeologist.

22:26.644 --> 22:27.777
Let me have
a look.

22:27.845 --> 22:30.247
<i>If father wanted to punish me,</i>

22:30.315 --> 22:31.648
He's done a great job.

22:31.716 --> 22:34.884
Oh, Livy, don't cry.

22:34.952 --> 22:37.721
Oh, hon, is he horrid?

22:37.788 --> 22:41.091
No. No.

22:41.158 --> 22:45.028
Livy, if he mistreats you
for even one second,

22:45.096 --> 22:47.497
I'm coming to get you.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.770
Abby, is there any word
from Edward?

22:53.838 --> 22:55.772
No.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.242
Oh, Livy,

22:58.309 --> 23:00.677
Remember, this isn't forever.

23:00.745 --> 23:04.114
I know.

23:04.181 --> 23:06.583
<i>All right now, the clutch</i>
<i>tends to stick.</i>

23:06.651 --> 23:08.552
You gotta
ease off slow.

23:13.858 --> 23:16.593
There you go.

23:21.031 --> 23:22.733
Shift, shift.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.368
Give it a pump.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.838
That's it.

23:28.906 --> 23:30.840
This is easy.

23:33.944 --> 23:35.545
<i>Now, the gas gauge says full,</i>

23:35.613 --> 23:36.580
But it isn't.

23:36.648 --> 23:37.814
You gotta hit it
just right,

23:37.882 --> 23:39.650
It'll tell you the truth
for one split second,

23:39.717 --> 23:41.685
Then it shoots right
back up there to full.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.487
Where do I hit it?

23:43.554 --> 23:45.422
Uh, right there.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.856
Just give it a pop.

23:47.858 --> 23:49.159
Quick like.

23:50.461 --> 23:51.928
That's it.

23:51.996 --> 23:53.664
We have
half a tank.

23:53.731 --> 23:55.932
The gas can's in back,
just in case.

23:57.902 --> 24:00.003
Wow, look at that.

24:03.941 --> 24:05.309
Are they Japanese?

24:05.376 --> 24:06.209
Watch the road.

24:06.277 --> 24:08.211
They're from camp amache.

24:08.279 --> 24:10.580
<i>That's an internment camp.</i>

24:10.648 --> 24:12.716
<i>Yes, it is.</i>
<i>Farms are short-handed.</i>

24:12.784 --> 24:15.585
The government needs the food,
so they send the workers.

24:15.653 --> 24:16.986
They work your farm?

24:17.054 --> 24:18.388
<i>Our</i> farm.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.824
Yes, they do.

24:26.931 --> 24:31.802
%% For the beauty of the earth %%

24:31.869 --> 24:37.106
%% for the glory of the skies %%

24:37.174 --> 24:42.111
%% for the love
which from our birth %%

24:42.179 --> 24:47.684
%% over and around us lies %%

24:47.752 --> 24:52.856
%% Lord of all to thee we raise %%

24:52.923 --> 24:58.428
%% this our hymn
of grateful praise %%

24:58.496 --> 25:03.400
%% Lord of all to thee we raise %%

25:03.468 --> 25:12.308
%% this our hymn
of grateful praise %%

25:12.377 --> 25:18.214
%% amen. %%

25:18.282 --> 25:23.052
Lord, we pray for the relief
of suffering

25:23.120 --> 25:26.490
And an end to war
throughout the world.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.057
Amen.

25:28.125 --> 25:29.325
<i>Amen.</i>

25:31.328 --> 25:33.029
Ruth's been dying
to meet you.

25:33.097 --> 25:33.764
She's my oldest.

25:33.831 --> 25:34.765
Hi, Ruth.

25:34.832 --> 25:35.932
I'm Livy.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.467
And the boy's
are running around,

25:37.535 --> 25:39.536
But they'll come in when they
realize the foods in here.

25:39.604 --> 25:40.537
Is your dress
store bought?

25:40.605 --> 25:41.838
Oh, my.

25:41.906 --> 25:43.172
Yes, it is.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.441
I bet it was.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.611
Well, Ray, are you
going to introduce us?

25:47.678 --> 25:48.678
Yes, ma'am.

25:48.746 --> 25:51.180
Miss Parker, this
is my wife, Livy.

25:51.248 --> 25:53.417
Your wife?
Well, how
do you do?

25:53.484 --> 25:54.518
Nice to meet you.

25:54.585 --> 25:56.052
Your wife!
I'm miss Parker.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.854
I've known Ray since
he was this high.

25:57.922 --> 25:59.222
And this
is Mrs. Pratt.

25:59.290 --> 26:00.657
Goodness me.
We never knew.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.025
So pleased to meet you.

26:02.092 --> 26:03.493
And Martha never
said a word.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.895
Yes, aren't we all blessed?

26:06.196 --> 26:07.831
Sweetheart, will you
help me at the table?

26:07.899 --> 26:08.832
Bye.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.866
Bye.

26:09.934 --> 26:11.334
You must not
be from here.

26:11.402 --> 26:12.836
We've been so
worried about Ray.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.471
The way things have
played out here.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.540
And not a single
young women to speak of.

26:16.607 --> 26:18.608
And Ray's such a
fine, young man.

26:18.676 --> 26:20.276
How'd you meet?
How'd you meet?

26:21.879 --> 26:23.179
I eloped...

26:23.247 --> 26:24.548
Uh, we met
in Denver.

26:24.615 --> 26:25.749
How romantic.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.350
I never knew you
traveled to Denver.

26:27.418 --> 26:28.752
You come sit by me

26:28.820 --> 26:29.986
At the potluck.

26:30.054 --> 26:31.955
We'd like stay,
but we gotta get on.

26:32.022 --> 26:33.623
But we're really gonna
enjoy your cake,

26:33.691 --> 26:34.991
Miss Pratt,
thank you.

26:35.059 --> 26:36.860
You're you're most
very welcome. Welcome.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.930
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.033
I just have a letter

26:44.101 --> 26:45.335
I need to drop
at the post office.

26:45.402 --> 26:46.503
It's Sunday.

26:46.571 --> 26:47.938
I could mail it
for you tomorrow.

26:48.005 --> 26:49.372
Oh, it already has
a stamp on it.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.808
I'm just going to drop it
in the box to my sister.

27:15.265 --> 27:17.333
Can you swim here?

27:17.401 --> 27:19.469
It's right shallow
for swimming.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.472
There's two feet of silt
down there.

27:24.074 --> 27:25.842
You like to swim?

27:25.910 --> 27:28.044
I used to.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.149
I used to love to swim.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.082
Thank you
for lying to Mrs. Pratt.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.525
Middle of the day is not
the best time for fishing.

28:16.894 --> 28:18.795
Being out here
is the point.

28:18.863 --> 28:23.934
Fishing's...
Just an excuse, I suspect.

29:10.681 --> 29:12.515
Excuse us.

29:12.583 --> 29:13.817
No, I'm sorry.

29:13.884 --> 29:15.919
What, what were you studying?

29:15.987 --> 29:18.354
Um... Butterflies.

29:18.422 --> 29:20.189
Do you collect?

29:20.257 --> 29:22.892
No. We log our observations
in our notebook.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.060
I'm Livy.

29:24.128 --> 29:25.996
I-I live in the farmhouse.

29:26.063 --> 29:28.098
We were just
getting back to work.

29:28.165 --> 29:29.265
No, wait, wait.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.200
What did I cause you to miss?

29:31.268 --> 29:33.536
What were you... What kind
of butterfly did you see?

29:33.604 --> 29:36.706
It was a common blue.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.341
There!

29:42.212 --> 29:44.748
Are... Are there
many species here?

29:44.815 --> 29:46.916
Yes, hundreds.

29:46.984 --> 29:48.051
Like what?

29:48.119 --> 29:51.021
Silver-spotted skippers...

29:51.088 --> 29:53.523
Mourning cloaks,
hawkmoths...

29:53.590 --> 29:54.824
Mm-hmm. Specklewoods.

29:56.593 --> 29:58.695
May I see your book?

30:12.276 --> 30:13.609
These are beautiful.

30:13.678 --> 30:14.878
Thank you.

30:14.945 --> 30:16.746
Look...

30:16.814 --> 30:18.381
There.

30:18.448 --> 30:19.382
Oh!

30:19.449 --> 30:20.550
What is it?

30:20.617 --> 30:24.487
A sulphur--
some species of sulphur.

30:26.557 --> 30:28.725
Shoo! Shoo!
I'm sorry.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.160
Franklin, no!

30:30.227 --> 30:31.728
He's your dog?

30:31.796 --> 30:35.531
No. Well... Uh,
are-are you thirsty?

30:35.599 --> 30:36.866
We should get back to work.

30:36.934 --> 30:38.935
Come to the house
anytime you have...

30:39.003 --> 30:40.003
We have cold colas

30:40.071 --> 30:41.137
In the icebox.

30:41.205 --> 30:42.172
Thank you.

30:42.239 --> 30:44.207
Wait! What are your names?

30:44.274 --> 30:45.408
Rose Umahara.

30:45.475 --> 30:46.843
And Florie.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.579
Bye. Bye.

30:49.646 --> 30:50.980
Bye.

30:58.823 --> 31:02.425
Go away, Franklin.

31:02.492 --> 31:04.060
Go away.

31:08.866 --> 31:11.400
I'm almost four months pregnant.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.803
Yes, that's
what I would have guessed.

31:13.871 --> 31:16.005
It was a mistake.

31:16.073 --> 31:17.173
When the baby arrives,

31:17.241 --> 31:19.142
You won't see it
as a mistake anymore.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.811
I'd like to believe you.

31:21.879 --> 31:24.781
Then do so,
Mrs. Singleton.

31:24.849 --> 31:29.385
Well, I'd say we're looking
at the third week of December.

31:29.453 --> 31:31.221
A Christmas baby.

31:31.288 --> 31:33.757
Mmm.

31:41.431 --> 31:44.234
While we're in town,
I need to mail a letter.

31:44.301 --> 31:46.136
Everything go all right?

31:46.203 --> 31:48.037
Everything's
right on schedule.

31:48.105 --> 31:49.639
Did he say when
the baby was coming?

31:49.706 --> 31:53.076
December. I could have
told you that before.

32:05.622 --> 32:06.722
People will know.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.357
People will know
the baby's early.

32:08.425 --> 32:09.725
What will they think, then?

32:09.794 --> 32:11.828
I don't care what people think.

32:11.896 --> 32:14.230
I don't see
how you could be immune.

32:14.298 --> 32:16.166
People judge, people gossip.

32:18.568 --> 32:21.437
They won't say a thing.

32:21.505 --> 32:23.673
And why is that?

32:23.740 --> 32:27.811
Well...
They want the best for us.

33:11.605 --> 33:13.706
Smells good.

33:16.844 --> 33:19.645
A fiesta omelet.

33:43.503 --> 33:46.039
Maybe I put too many
jalapeño peppers in it.

33:46.106 --> 33:48.541
No, it's real good.

33:48.608 --> 33:49.709
Real good cooking.

33:49.776 --> 33:51.711
The cheese--
I forgot the cheese.

33:51.778 --> 33:53.479
It might mellow it;
hold on.

33:58.385 --> 34:00.220
What is that?

34:00.287 --> 34:01.821
That'll be hank.

34:01.889 --> 34:03.422
What's that,
what's that sound?

34:03.490 --> 34:05.558
It's the claw.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.172
What are you doing
with that thing?

34:19.239 --> 34:21.407
Thanks. You said
you like to swim.

34:21.475 --> 34:23.409
Dig you a hole
so summertimes,

34:23.476 --> 34:25.978
You and the children
can go swimming.

34:28.315 --> 34:31.083
"Children"?

34:36.857 --> 34:39.092
Aunt Livy!

34:42.496 --> 34:43.696
Hi!

34:43.764 --> 34:45.031
Hi.

34:45.099 --> 34:47.600
Hey, I hope you don't
mind us coming along.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.467
The boys couldn't miss it.
Hank.

34:49.536 --> 34:51.971
It's not every day
somebody digs a hole.

34:52.039 --> 34:54.107
That one that flew by
there, that's Chester,

34:54.174 --> 34:55.108
And this is hank Jr.

34:55.175 --> 34:56.409
Hello, hank Jr.

34:56.476 --> 34:57.576
Hi, nice to meet you.

34:57.644 --> 34:58.644
Nice to meet you.

35:02.582 --> 35:04.683
Do you like my hair?

35:04.751 --> 35:06.419
You look lovely.

35:06.486 --> 35:08.388
She asked me
to do it up
just like yours.

35:08.455 --> 35:10.924
Hank, honey,

35:10.991 --> 35:12.525
Keep a watch on your brother.

35:12.592 --> 35:14.860
Make sure
he doesn't get under that thing.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.229
Here, Franklin, here, boy.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.298
Get in there, Ray!

35:25.839 --> 35:27.673
So, have you chosen a name

35:27.741 --> 35:29.242
For your baby?
Ruth.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.044
Well, you told me uncle Ray

35:31.111 --> 35:32.412
And aunt Livy
were having a baby.

35:32.479 --> 35:34.147
Aren't you?

35:36.083 --> 35:39.152
I hav... I haven't
thought of a name yet.

35:39.219 --> 35:40.786
I like the name Patricia.

35:40.854 --> 35:43.323
My parents had to go
and name me Ruth.

35:44.425 --> 35:45.891
Ruth is an old
biblical name.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.094
It's a very beautiful one,
in my opinion.

35:48.162 --> 35:50.029
Thank you.

35:50.097 --> 35:51.597
Maybe now she'll keep it.

35:51.665 --> 35:52.999
Boys, get on!

35:54.034 --> 35:55.034
Get on!

35:57.838 --> 35:59.138
Move it on out of here, boys!

35:59.206 --> 36:01.674
Uncle Ray's
at the wheel.

36:03.643 --> 36:05.611
Martha,
did you grow up in this house?

36:05.679 --> 36:07.080
I did.

36:07.147 --> 36:08.714
Our grandpa built it.

36:08.782 --> 36:11.750
And before that,
he and grandma
lived in a dugout,

36:11.818 --> 36:14.520
Which is still
over there by
the south field.

36:14.588 --> 36:15.621
Right?

36:15.689 --> 36:18.524
Really?

36:18.592 --> 36:20.460
So, you never lived
anywhere else?

36:20.527 --> 36:22.862
Nope.

36:22.929 --> 36:26.099
Our younger brother, Danny...

36:26.166 --> 36:28.434
Was the adventurous one.

36:34.008 --> 36:35.208
Drop it now!

36:40.680 --> 36:42.615
On the left, Ray!

36:42.682 --> 36:44.150
Pull it way back

36:44.218 --> 36:45.284
To the left!

36:45.352 --> 36:46.585
What?!

36:49.056 --> 36:50.623
What's in your locket?

36:50.690 --> 36:53.426
Oh, I forgot I was wearing it.

36:53.494 --> 36:55.094
Ruth, don't pry.

36:55.162 --> 36:57.897
It's as if your mother
didn't teach you any manners.

36:57.964 --> 37:00.299
Easy, easy!

37:00.367 --> 37:01.734
It looks a little heavy, Ray!

37:07.441 --> 37:08.741
Drop her down!

37:15.282 --> 37:17.716
Lever on the left!

37:17.784 --> 37:18.617
On the left!

37:23.190 --> 37:25.358
Isn't there a manual
for that thing?

37:25.426 --> 37:26.526
Well, if there were,

37:26.593 --> 37:28.127
Do you think
they'd read it?

37:31.898 --> 37:33.699
That was easy!

37:36.470 --> 37:38.504
I didn't ask him
to do that--

37:38.572 --> 37:40.306
To dig a swimming hole.

37:40.374 --> 37:44.143
I don't know why
he's going to the trouble.

37:44.211 --> 37:46.612
He just wants
to please you.

37:54.988 --> 37:57.190
I may not dance.

37:57.257 --> 38:00.159
Well, Martha'll just
be glad we're there.

38:02.362 --> 38:05.331
She's always been
a fool for dancing.

38:05.399 --> 38:07.100
Slim's her favorite.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.577
Don't you ever wonder
what else is out there,

38:17.644 --> 38:19.612
Beyond the farm?

38:19.679 --> 38:22.715
Sometimes.

38:22.782 --> 38:26.452
Aren't you curious
how other people live?

38:26.520 --> 38:29.255
I enjoy a drive, but...

38:29.323 --> 38:31.324
I like coming
back to my place.

38:31.391 --> 38:32.758
Sleeping on my land.

38:32.826 --> 38:36.129
Your land.

38:36.196 --> 38:38.464
It seems
every war in human history

38:38.532 --> 38:40.199
Is about owning the land.

38:42.503 --> 38:43.869
I like the Indian view--

38:43.937 --> 38:45.871
That we're
just temporary guardians

38:45.939 --> 38:47.473
Of the land where we live.

38:47.541 --> 38:50.909
It's not temporary to me.

38:50.977 --> 38:53.012
But your family's
owned this land

38:53.079 --> 38:54.614
For less than a hundred years.

38:54.681 --> 38:56.815
In the span of history,
that's nothing.

38:59.919 --> 39:02.821
In the span of a life...

39:02.889 --> 39:04.690
That's near everything.

39:32.186 --> 39:33.352
Come on, girl!

39:38.758 --> 39:40.693
You're next, you know!

39:40.760 --> 39:42.495
And you think I'm joking.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.803
Come on, girl.

39:53.106 --> 39:55.841
They're here--
uncle Ray and aunt Livy.

39:55.909 --> 39:57.076
Oh!

39:58.078 --> 39:59.612
Ah, there they are.

40:01.415 --> 40:02.515
Happy birthday.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.016
Hey, Ray.

40:04.084 --> 40:05.184
Hey!

40:05.252 --> 40:06.852
Happy birthday, sis.
Oh, finally.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.187
It's not a party
till you come.

40:08.255 --> 40:09.689
Come on, come on.

40:09.756 --> 40:11.090
There's my guy.

40:47.427 --> 40:50.696
Ray, you really ought to dance.

40:50.764 --> 40:52.298
I'm fine.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.674
All right.

41:03.176 --> 41:04.843
You sure?
Yeah.

41:04.911 --> 41:06.746
All right.

41:23.597 --> 41:26.031
How about a dance
with my beautiful daughter?

41:26.099 --> 41:27.600
Aw...

41:34.408 --> 41:35.775
Hank Jr?

41:36.810 --> 41:39.011
Come here.

41:39.078 --> 41:41.079
Come here.

41:55.429 --> 41:56.762
Good.

42:26.125 --> 42:28.026
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

42:28.094 --> 42:30.095
Right here.

42:57.524 --> 42:59.792
It was good.

43:02.095 --> 43:05.431
We're here tonight
to celebrate a birthday.

43:05.499 --> 43:09.201
I've known
this fine, young lady since...

43:09.269 --> 43:11.069
Since I was slim.

43:12.439 --> 43:16.575
Martha, hank says
you're a fine wife.

43:16.643 --> 43:18.511
That's the truth, slim.
The best.

43:18.578 --> 43:20.479
We know you're
a fine mother,

43:20.547 --> 43:23.449
You bet.
And you're a first-
class friend.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.718
Happy birthday.

43:25.786 --> 43:27.252
Thank you.
- Happy birthday!

43:27.320 --> 43:28.521
Thank you, sweetheart.

43:28.588 --> 43:30.355
That's my girl.

43:30.424 --> 43:31.657
Thank you.

43:31.725 --> 43:33.526
%% This isn't just a story %%

43:33.593 --> 43:35.994
%% or a tale, as it may seem %%

43:36.062 --> 43:38.864
Thank you.
%% It's all about
my brown-eyed gal... %%

43:38.932 --> 43:40.699
Thank you, honey.
I love you, Martha.

43:40.767 --> 43:41.767
I know.

43:41.835 --> 43:44.202
%% If you could only see her %%

43:44.270 --> 43:47.172
%% I am sure that
you will agree %%

43:47.240 --> 43:48.941
%% that she will be
the only girl %%

43:49.008 --> 43:52.177
%% for you as well as me %%

43:52.245 --> 43:54.847
%% she's my brown-eyed baby %%

43:54.915 --> 43:57.683
%% she's as pretty as can be %%

43:57.751 --> 44:00.352
%% her eyes, they shine
like starlight %%

44:00.420 --> 44:03.021
%% and they're
just as bright to me %%

44:03.089 --> 44:08.861
%% when I look into her eyes,
say, I really heave a sigh %%

44:08.929 --> 44:12.331
%% yes, sir, she's
my brown-eyed baby... %%

44:19.038 --> 44:20.038
Hi, Livy.

44:22.075 --> 44:23.509
Hi.

44:23.577 --> 44:25.310
One...

44:31.250 --> 44:33.853
Hi.
I brought drinks.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.354
Thank you.
Thank you.

44:35.421 --> 44:37.356
Mm-hmm. Let's sit.

44:37.423 --> 44:39.492
We skipped off
from our overseer.

44:39.559 --> 44:40.693
Florie...

44:40.760 --> 44:42.361
Although we shouldn't
tell you that.

44:42.428 --> 44:44.029
This is your land.

44:44.097 --> 44:45.364
My husband's.

44:45.431 --> 44:46.799
He's handsome.

44:46.867 --> 44:47.800
Who?

44:47.868 --> 44:49.167
Your husband.

44:49.235 --> 44:50.636
Oh.

44:55.742 --> 44:58.677
So, um, where
were you...

44:58.745 --> 45:00.679
Before the war?

45:00.747 --> 45:01.680
California.

45:01.748 --> 45:05.183
Mm-hmm. Born and raised.

45:05.251 --> 45:07.620
We were both
at USC.

45:07.687 --> 45:09.889
What were your majors?

45:09.956 --> 45:11.724
Mine was English.

45:11.791 --> 45:13.425
English.

45:13.493 --> 45:16.161
I hoped to teach literature
someday.

45:17.831 --> 45:18.964
Rose is a long-term planner.

45:19.032 --> 45:21.099
Everything in her life
she plans

45:21.167 --> 45:22.902
Ten years in advance.

45:24.470 --> 45:27.506
You didn't plan on this,
did you, Rose?

45:27.574 --> 45:28.908
Picking potatoes?

45:28.975 --> 45:30.776
At least I had plans.

45:33.212 --> 45:35.113
I hadn't declared
my major yet.

45:35.181 --> 45:37.049
Too many things
interested me.

45:37.116 --> 45:38.350
Mm-hmm. Too many boys.

45:40.353 --> 45:41.754
I was in
graduate school

45:41.821 --> 45:44.857
In Denver, studying
archeology.

45:44.925 --> 45:47.526
Someday, I wanted
to go to Turkey

45:47.594 --> 45:50.095
To see the lost cities
of Ephesus and Troy.

45:50.163 --> 45:52.431
Really?

45:55.936 --> 45:58.303
Why did you leave your studies?

45:58.371 --> 45:59.504
My mother got sick,

45:59.573 --> 46:01.339
And Abby...

46:01.407 --> 46:03.508
Uh, my sister, was
already married,

46:03.577 --> 46:06.879
So I left school to be
with her until she died.

46:08.414 --> 46:09.748
I'm sorry.

46:09.816 --> 46:11.684
And then,

46:11.751 --> 46:15.287
Before I knew it,
I was... Swept off my feet,

46:15.354 --> 46:16.254
And now I'm here.

46:17.591 --> 46:18.724
That's so romantic.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.127
When are you expecting?

46:22.829 --> 46:23.629
Florie.

46:24.664 --> 46:25.764
I'm sorry.

46:25.832 --> 46:27.967
No, I didn't
realize it showed.

46:28.034 --> 46:29.835
Forgive us
for prying...

46:29.903 --> 46:32.671
Do you need
maternity clothes?

46:32.739 --> 46:35.340
I hadn't really
thought about it yet.

46:35.408 --> 46:37.476
Well, our father's
a tailor.

46:37.543 --> 46:38.477
We all sew

46:38.544 --> 46:39.544
In the family.

46:39.613 --> 46:40.813
Choose the fabric,
and we'll make you

46:40.880 --> 46:42.014
Something.
Uh-huh.

46:42.082 --> 46:44.549
Thank you.

46:45.752 --> 46:47.019
Thank you so
mu... Thank you.

46:47.087 --> 46:49.021
You're welcome.
It's our pleasure.

46:49.089 --> 46:51.189
Bye.
Bye. Thank you.

47:03.269 --> 47:05.037
Ooh, the wind's turned.

47:05.105 --> 47:07.640
Coming out of the north.

47:07.707 --> 47:11.176
I made friends with two girls
from the work crew today.

47:11.244 --> 47:13.012
They study butterflies,
and I was thinking

47:13.079 --> 47:15.514
I could take them for a drive
in the mountains sometime.

47:15.581 --> 47:16.882
Japanese?

47:16.950 --> 47:19.685
Well, they're American.

47:19.753 --> 47:23.421
Those Americans
who look Japanese.

47:32.932 --> 47:36.769
You blame them
for pearl harbor, for Daniel?

47:38.271 --> 47:40.505
I'm not as stupid
as you think.

47:40.573 --> 47:43.241
I know they're not
the same people who
bombed pearl harbor.

47:43.309 --> 47:45.844
They kept our crops
going the past
couple of years.

47:45.912 --> 47:47.345
I never said
you were stupid.

47:47.413 --> 47:48.847
And I never said
I disliked them.

47:48.915 --> 47:51.216
I just said they were
Japanese, that's all.

47:51.284 --> 47:53.686
And you keep your distance.

47:53.753 --> 47:55.821
Look, I got a lot
to do around here.

47:55.889 --> 47:58.190
I got to keep this place
going pretty much on my own.

47:58.257 --> 48:00.859
I don't go into the fields to...

48:00.927 --> 48:02.761
To socialize.

48:06.766 --> 48:09.534
Rose and Florie
both went to USC.

48:09.602 --> 48:12.537
Can't tell you how good it is
to talk about something

48:12.605 --> 48:15.407
Other than crops
and the weather.

48:19.913 --> 48:21.914
I bet.

48:25.018 --> 48:27.519
Thank you, Lord,
for your gifts,

48:27.587 --> 48:29.888
And may we be ever mindful
of your love.

48:29.956 --> 48:32.024
Amen.
- Amen.

48:32.092 --> 48:33.726
Pass the taters.

48:33.793 --> 48:36.795
Put your napkin
on your lap first.

48:36.863 --> 48:39.264
Would you care
for a roll, Livy?

48:41.034 --> 48:43.602
Thanks. Ray?

48:50.643 --> 48:53.078
I'm considering beans
in the north field.

48:54.948 --> 48:57.116
Mm. Are you?

48:57.183 --> 48:59.517
Price of beans can't
go anywhere but up.

48:59.585 --> 49:01.353
Yeah.

49:05.424 --> 49:06.925
Well, what do you think?

49:09.428 --> 49:13.431
I've been thinking
about... About Troy.

49:15.434 --> 49:16.902
Troy who?

49:17.937 --> 49:19.638
City of. The lost one,

49:19.705 --> 49:21.673
Over there
in Turkey.

49:21.741 --> 49:23.208
Turkey?

49:26.846 --> 49:28.981
Uh, Homer wrote about it
in the <i>Iliad.</i>

49:29.048 --> 49:31.316
No one knew if there really had
been such a city,

49:31.384 --> 49:33.652
Or if Troy was merely

49:33.719 --> 49:37.322
A myth until an archeologist
found it.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.928
How do you lose a city?

49:43.963 --> 49:45.363
Under the sand.

49:45.431 --> 49:47.565
They, uh... They
had to excavate it.

49:47.633 --> 49:49.567
Well, I'll be.

49:49.635 --> 49:51.904
We could've...
We could've dug it up, Ray,

49:51.971 --> 49:53.105
With the claw.

50:00.914 --> 50:05.217
So, Ray, are you going to plant
some beans this year?

50:07.086 --> 50:09.754
If you think we ought to.

50:32.745 --> 50:34.179
Good night.

50:34.247 --> 50:36.414
Good night.

51:16.555 --> 51:18.924
Abby?

51:19.926 --> 51:21.693
Abby?!

51:24.597 --> 51:26.531
Abby!

51:26.599 --> 51:27.699
Oh...

51:27.767 --> 51:28.867
Whoo!

51:28.935 --> 51:31.336
Oh...

51:31.404 --> 51:33.105
hello, hello.

51:34.140 --> 51:36.041
Franklin, it's okay, shh.

51:36.109 --> 51:37.376
Is everything all right?

51:37.443 --> 51:38.476
Uh, no.

51:38.544 --> 51:40.012
What? What's happened?
Is it father?

51:40.079 --> 51:42.047
No, he's fine. It's Kent.

51:42.115 --> 51:44.049
They shipped him out.
He left last week.

51:44.117 --> 51:45.717
Oh, hon, I'm so sorry.

51:45.785 --> 51:48.620
I'm so sorry.

51:49.622 --> 51:51.523
It's worse than
I ever imagined.

51:51.590 --> 51:53.691
You're out in the
middle of nowhere.

51:53.759 --> 51:55.693
There are more people around
than you'd think.

51:55.761 --> 51:57.529
We haven't heard from
you in almost a month.

51:57.596 --> 51:59.531
I know. I've just been...

51:59.598 --> 52:02.034
Getting a little
adjusted, I guess.

52:02.101 --> 52:05.437
Liv, that skirt is
too small for you.

52:06.605 --> 52:09.541
Uh...

52:09.608 --> 52:12.144
Come inside, come inside.

52:14.981 --> 52:16.581
I want you to move
back to Denver

52:16.649 --> 52:17.715
And stay with me.

52:19.652 --> 52:21.420
Abby, how could I do that?

52:21.487 --> 52:22.988
How could you not?

52:23.056 --> 52:25.357
You're not having your baby
on a beet farm.

52:29.395 --> 52:31.563
I need your help.

52:31.630 --> 52:34.066
With Kent overseas
for who knows how long,

52:34.133 --> 52:35.733
I'll go mad in that house alone.

52:35.801 --> 52:38.136
You've no idea how lonely it is.

52:38.204 --> 52:41.340
I used to feel that way...
When I was caring for mother.

52:41.407 --> 52:43.508
I would just sit
there waiting

52:43.576 --> 52:45.410
For those minutes a day
she was awake.

52:45.478 --> 52:46.911
It wasn't fair
for daddy to drop

52:46.980 --> 52:49.747
The entire burden
of caring for mother on you.

52:49.815 --> 52:52.417
I had my hands full with Kent.

52:52.485 --> 52:54.987
But we'd have
such a good time now, Liv,

52:55.054 --> 52:58.690
Just the two of us...
Until Kent got home.

52:58.757 --> 53:00.325
Ray.

53:00.393 --> 53:02.127
Look who's here.

53:02.195 --> 53:04.329
This is my sister, Abby.

53:04.397 --> 53:06.064
Uh, nice to meet you.

53:06.132 --> 53:07.065
Hello.

53:07.133 --> 53:09.134
Welcome.

53:28.287 --> 53:29.921
What?
Rain.

53:29.989 --> 53:33.591
All anyone talks
about is the weather.

53:36.962 --> 53:38.663
Livy, when are
you coming home?

53:40.466 --> 53:42.067
What about the baby?

53:42.135 --> 53:44.236
I'll baby-sit.

53:44.303 --> 53:47.139
You can go back to school.
Why not?

53:47.206 --> 53:49.908
Father's satisfied.
You're married.

53:49.975 --> 53:53.078
There'll be no baby born
out of wedlock.

53:53.146 --> 53:56.248
There's more than one way
to work the rumor mill, Livy.

53:56.315 --> 53:59.717
A few well-chosen words
among the gossips at church...

53:59.785 --> 54:01.253
What do you mean?

54:01.320 --> 54:03.255
The Denver ladies
will be tripping

54:03.322 --> 54:05.424
Over themselves
to offer you sympathy.

54:05.491 --> 54:08.760
Who knew he drank
or had that temper?

54:08.827 --> 54:11.196
Can you image raising
a child in a home

54:11.264 --> 54:12.897
Like that?
No, that's not Ray.

54:12.965 --> 54:14.066
So?

54:14.133 --> 54:15.900
Ray? No.

54:15.968 --> 54:18.203
Ray's the most gentle
man I've ever met.

54:18.271 --> 54:19.571
This has nothing
to do with him.

54:19.638 --> 54:21.639
It's about doing
what's best for you.

54:27.813 --> 54:29.647
Any word from Edward?

54:29.715 --> 54:32.484
Mm, no.

54:33.986 --> 54:36.955
Livy, you had
so many plans.

54:37.022 --> 54:39.991
No one deserves to stay married
to someone they don't love,

54:40.059 --> 54:43.661
Especially not you.

54:48.301 --> 54:50.068
Give my love to father.

54:50.136 --> 54:51.636
I will.

54:58.978 --> 55:00.979
Does he ever ask about me?

55:01.046 --> 55:02.614
Yes, often.

55:04.317 --> 55:05.817
You're a terrible liar.

55:08.721 --> 55:11.656
Will you mail this
letter for me?

55:13.959 --> 55:15.994
Sure, hon.

55:16.061 --> 55:17.061
Bye.

55:19.165 --> 55:21.065
Love you.

55:21.134 --> 55:22.467
Mm-mm.

55:30.909 --> 55:33.911
%% Cheeks of Rose %%

55:33.979 --> 55:36.914
%% tiny toes %%

55:36.982 --> 55:41.085
%% has our little baby %%

55:41.154 --> 55:43.921
%% eyes of blue %%

55:43.989 --> 55:46.591
%% fingers, too %%

55:46.659 --> 55:50.195
%% cunning all as may be... %%

55:50.263 --> 55:51.263
Hi.

55:52.998 --> 55:54.366
Hi.

55:56.969 --> 55:58.403
You were singing.

55:59.972 --> 56:01.640
What was it?

56:02.975 --> 56:06.744
It's just a song
daddy'd sing to us kids.

56:06.812 --> 56:09.814
I was trying to remember it
so I could sing it to the baby.

56:14.654 --> 56:16.087
My sister wants me

56:16.155 --> 56:17.589
To go back to
Denver to deliver...

56:17.657 --> 56:20.659
In the hospital.

56:24.830 --> 56:26.264
Where is she?

56:26.332 --> 56:28.333
She left already.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.740
I'll make some lunch.

56:52.157 --> 56:55.594
Swallowtail.

56:55.661 --> 56:57.596
Probably a
western tiger.

56:57.663 --> 56:58.763
Those spots.

56:58.831 --> 57:00.932
The spots on the wings
are beautiful.

57:00.999 --> 57:03.201
False eyes.

57:03.269 --> 57:05.337
Oh, Florie, did you get it?

57:05.404 --> 57:07.672
Got it.

57:07.740 --> 57:10.475
False eyes confuse
its enemy.

57:10.543 --> 57:11.843
Moths have them, too.

57:11.910 --> 57:12.844
How can you tell

57:12.911 --> 57:14.246
A moth from a butterfly?

57:14.313 --> 57:16.248
Moths rest
with their wings spread,

57:16.315 --> 57:17.915
Butterflies
with their wings together.

57:17.983 --> 57:19.751
And more often,
moths have

57:19.818 --> 57:22.019
Protective coloring
so they blend in.

57:22.087 --> 57:25.089
Butterflies are bold.

57:25.157 --> 57:28.192
Just look at some of the species
we've found. See?

57:28.261 --> 57:29.927
Colors.

57:29.995 --> 57:31.829
Mm.

57:32.998 --> 57:34.899
What is this?

57:36.636 --> 57:37.602
That was strictly

57:37.670 --> 57:39.237
For our observations,
Florie.

57:39.305 --> 57:41.239
Stop fussing.

57:41.307 --> 57:42.607
Perfect.

57:42.675 --> 57:44.643
Florie...

57:45.745 --> 57:49.314
Look! Look!

58:04.497 --> 58:06.431
Wow, this is nice.

58:06.499 --> 58:07.599
After your
second baby.

58:09.168 --> 58:10.935
What's your husband's
favorite color?

58:11.003 --> 58:13.772
I don't know.

58:13.839 --> 58:15.407
What's yours?

58:15.474 --> 58:17.709
Blue and red.

58:17.777 --> 58:19.544
Like the false eyes
on a swallowtail.

58:19.612 --> 58:20.912
Yes, exactly.

58:20.979 --> 58:22.480
How's this?
Ooh, I love that.

58:22.548 --> 58:23.782
Oh, good.

58:23.849 --> 58:25.717
Father makes
the finest suits, Livy.

58:30.989 --> 58:34.192
Uh... It would be
wonderful if you

58:34.259 --> 58:35.460
Could come and meet
our parents...

58:35.528 --> 58:37.195
Would you please not
handle the fabric?

58:37.262 --> 58:40.365
I'm going to buy this.

58:40.433 --> 58:42.534
Are you with
these people?

58:42.601 --> 58:44.436
Yes, I am.

58:44.503 --> 58:46.705
Well, if they could get
on with their business,

58:46.772 --> 58:48.506
Management would
appreciate it.

58:59.084 --> 59:01.152
What else do
we need here?

59:01.220 --> 59:05.857
%% They asked me how I knew %%

59:05.924 --> 59:11.195
%% my true love was true %%

59:11.263 --> 59:14.532
%% I, of course, replied %%

59:14.600 --> 59:18.202
%% something here inside %%

59:18.270 --> 59:22.407
%% cannot be denied. %%

59:22.475 --> 59:24.342
Germans.

59:24.410 --> 59:26.745
Those are German POWs.

59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.578
%% %%

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:09.020
We'll do a fitting soon.

01:00:09.087 --> 01:00:10.855
Yes.

01:00:10.923 --> 01:00:12.524
Bye, Livy.
Bye.

01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:14.592
Thank you, Livy.

01:00:16.261 --> 01:00:17.361
See you.

01:01:52.324 --> 01:01:52.991
Oh, my!

01:01:55.794 --> 01:01:56.961
Oh.

01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:30.528
I was getting
worried.

01:02:30.596 --> 01:02:32.030
Sorry I'm late.

01:02:32.097 --> 01:02:33.364
I found the dugout--

01:02:33.432 --> 01:02:35.867
The dugout that Martha
was talking about.

01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:38.036
Look, arrowheads.

01:02:38.103 --> 01:02:39.871
Livy, I don't mean
to disappoint you,

01:02:39.939 --> 01:02:41.706
But my granddaddy
owned a gun.

01:02:41.774 --> 01:02:44.042
For sure, he didn't
use a bow and arrow.

01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:46.544
No, I know that,
but he or your grandmother

01:02:46.612 --> 01:02:48.212
Were interested enough
to collect them.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.548
Look. A whole jar
of flints.

01:02:50.616 --> 01:02:53.051
Someone in your family
was a budding archeologist.

01:02:54.587 --> 01:02:56.588
Look at this one.

01:03:02.527 --> 01:03:05.697
I so wish father could
have done this himself.

01:03:05.764 --> 01:03:06.965
He's the expert,

01:03:07.032 --> 01:03:09.634
But he hasn't been well
since the move.

01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:11.970
They took his work

01:03:12.037 --> 01:03:14.038
And... And our house.

01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:16.808
Still, he says,

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:20.979
We must prove our loyalty.

01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:25.149
We must show them
we are good Americans.

01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:26.550
He buys war bonds.

01:03:26.619 --> 01:03:27.585
Florie.

01:03:27.653 --> 01:03:29.487
Mother's no
better, Livy.

01:03:29.554 --> 01:03:31.889
She made us
clean the house...

01:03:31.957 --> 01:03:33.557
Stop.

01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:36.794
We had to sell our house
for half its worth,

01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:40.898
Yet my mother insisted
we clean it for the new owners.

01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:45.402
We even waxed the floors.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.905
I still don't understand
why you're so angry about that.

01:03:47.973 --> 01:03:49.907
Of course we wanted
to present a clean house.

01:03:49.975 --> 01:03:51.943
It was stolen from us, Rose.

01:03:55.914 --> 01:03:58.616
You know why there are so few
young men at camp amache?

01:03:58.684 --> 01:04:00.952
Why?

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.188
They were drafted.

01:04:04.256 --> 01:04:07.525
The 442nd regiment
fighting in France.

01:04:07.592 --> 01:04:08.726
Enough!

01:04:10.162 --> 01:04:12.030
And Rose is like
our parents.

01:04:12.097 --> 01:04:15.933
Always proper,
always good.

01:04:28.747 --> 01:04:30.081
Thank you, Livy.

01:04:30.149 --> 01:04:31.382
Thank you so much.

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:33.918
Thank you.

01:04:33.986 --> 01:04:36.020
You're welcome.

01:04:41.493 --> 01:04:42.660
Livy...

01:04:44.196 --> 01:04:45.462
I've met someone.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:47.965
Florence!

01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:49.500
We met on one
of the farms...

01:04:49.568 --> 01:04:54.538
He was guarding the German POWs
working there.

01:04:54.606 --> 01:04:56.708
He gave me this.

01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:58.710
Oh...

01:04:58.777 --> 01:05:00.444
It belonged to his mother.

01:05:02.447 --> 01:05:04.381
You must be very special to him.

01:05:04.449 --> 01:05:07.418
He tells me I am.

01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:09.087
Florie, we have to get back.

01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:13.925
Rose is just jealous.

01:05:13.992 --> 01:05:17.294
Um, but I want you to meet him.

01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:18.429
Will you?

01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:19.897
Of course I will.

01:05:19.965 --> 01:05:22.433
Good. Thank you.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.735
What's his name?

01:05:23.802 --> 01:05:26.537
Walter.

01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:27.571
Bye, Livy.

01:05:27.639 --> 01:05:28.639
Bye.

01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:31.675
Bye, Rose.
Bye, Livy.

01:05:32.945 --> 01:05:34.378
Thank you. Bye.

01:05:34.446 --> 01:05:37.215
Why on earth did you
bring him up?

01:05:51.096 --> 01:05:52.663
No! No!

01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:53.731
What? What-what's wrong?

01:05:53.799 --> 01:05:55.032
My artifacts
from the dugout.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.067
What are you doing?!

01:05:56.135 --> 01:05:57.368
I was just cleaning
out the shed.

01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:58.903
Where is the burlap bag?

01:05:58.971 --> 01:06:00.171
What did you do with it!

01:06:05.944 --> 01:06:07.645
Livy.

01:06:31.736 --> 01:06:33.271
It was near the bottom
of the pile.

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.811
It hadn't caught fire.

01:06:47.019 --> 01:06:48.886
Livy, this is
a working farm.

01:06:48.954 --> 01:06:51.789
If something doesn't have a use,
I throw it out.

01:06:54.159 --> 01:06:55.526
I thought it was trash.

01:06:55.593 --> 01:06:58.395
It's not trash, it's history.

01:06:58.463 --> 01:07:00.331
It's <i>your</i> history.

01:07:04.736 --> 01:07:06.737
I'd do anything...

01:07:09.107 --> 01:07:11.675
I'd do anything
to make you happy.

01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:14.846
I know.

01:07:14.913 --> 01:07:16.613
I know that.

01:07:27.726 --> 01:07:30.761
<i>Dear Livy, if you like junk,</i>
<i>you'll like the cellar.</i>

01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:32.763
<i>Be careful.</i>
<i>It's Dusty down there.</i>

01:09:01.086 --> 01:09:04.255
Higher, there...
Wait, um...

01:09:04.322 --> 01:09:07.258
I'm not sure why we're putting
an old ox yoke inside the house.

01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:10.127
It was probably that very yoke
your grandfather used

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:11.662
To first break this land.

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:15.532
Yeah, well, it's about
to break my back.

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:22.439
I want to show you
the family history

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.408
That means the most to me.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.551
I let him talk me into a deal.

01:09:36.988 --> 01:09:42.158
If I'd stay behind
and work the farm,

01:09:42.227 --> 01:09:43.694
He'd join the navy.

01:09:51.336 --> 01:09:54.671
Landlocked his
whole growing up,

01:09:54.739 --> 01:09:57.074
He was always dreaming
of the ocean.

01:10:04.216 --> 01:10:07.918
I was the oldest.

01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:10.287
I should have gone.

01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:28.239
Remember, your phone
is ring-ring-ring.

01:10:28.306 --> 01:10:30.674
Come on, daddy,
let's get to Wilson!

01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:32.476
All right,
let's go.

01:10:32.543 --> 01:10:35.212
If you hear only ring,
that's Miss Paulson.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.047
Ring-ring is the Mcgregors.

01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:39.483
Ring-ring-ring,
that's your signal.

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.885
Ring-ring-ring.

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:47.858
Hello.

01:10:47.926 --> 01:10:49.726
We're talking
on the telephone!

01:10:49.794 --> 01:10:51.528
Hey, everybody it's hank here!

01:10:51.596 --> 01:10:52.529
It works!

01:10:52.597 --> 01:10:54.631
Hi, aunt Livy!

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.734
You want to come in?

01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:32.469
All right.
Come on! Come on!

01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:36.340
It's getting cold out here.

01:11:36.408 --> 01:11:37.908
Come on, Franklin.

01:12:38.203 --> 01:12:40.070
Hi.

01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:49.946
We don't have animals
in this house.

01:12:50.015 --> 01:12:51.548
Get out! Get out!

01:12:51.616 --> 01:12:55.119
Get out now! Get out!

01:12:56.154 --> 01:12:58.022
Get out!

01:13:00.892 --> 01:13:04.161
It's just for tonight.
It's terribly cold out there.

01:13:06.764 --> 01:13:07.964
I grew up here.

01:13:08.033 --> 01:13:09.466
I ate at this table.

01:13:09.534 --> 01:13:11.135
For all my growing up,

01:13:11.202 --> 01:13:12.869
My mama never let a dog
in the house,

01:13:12.937 --> 01:13:13.937
And I won't either.

01:13:14.972 --> 01:13:16.806
He'll freeze.

01:13:27.018 --> 01:13:30.020
This came for you today.

01:13:35.126 --> 01:13:36.860
To Livy Dunne.

01:13:41.399 --> 01:13:43.934
I'm guessing he didn't
know you were married, huh?

01:13:52.243 --> 01:13:54.311
I'm taking the night shift
at the beet factory.

01:13:54.379 --> 01:13:57.981
It's something I sometimes
do this time of year.

01:13:58.049 --> 01:14:01.151
Don't bother waiting up.

01:14:30.714 --> 01:14:32.615
I didn't know what you
had for breakfast,

01:14:32.683 --> 01:14:34.251
Because I've never
been up that early.

01:14:34.319 --> 01:14:36.320
But I made you some
eggs and some oatmeal.

01:14:36.387 --> 01:14:37.387
There's no need.

01:14:37.455 --> 01:14:38.555
Just plain eggs.

01:14:38.622 --> 01:14:40.757
There's no onions or peppers.

01:14:42.427 --> 01:14:44.061
Ray, wait.

01:14:44.128 --> 01:14:46.596
I'm sorry that I let
Franklin in the house.

01:14:46.664 --> 01:14:48.865
I did not realize what
an insult that would be to you.

01:14:48.933 --> 01:14:52.936
With all the other animals in
that barn, that dog'll be fine.

01:14:55.906 --> 01:14:58.141
I have something
I want to tell you.

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:05.682
My first day here,

01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:08.452
I looked in your dresser.

01:15:08.519 --> 01:15:13.390
I can't even
explain why I did it.

01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:14.824
I'm sorry.

01:15:14.892 --> 01:15:16.994
You could've looked in there
anytime you wanted.

01:15:17.061 --> 01:15:19.262
I got nothing to hide from you.

01:15:21.699 --> 01:15:22.799
There was a watch.

01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:24.801
I could
hear it ticking.

01:15:24.869 --> 01:15:26.769
I've never seen
you carry it.

01:15:26.837 --> 01:15:28.305
It was my father's.

01:15:28.373 --> 01:15:32.142
Sometimes I wind it up
when I want to remember him.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:36.146
I remembered how good
he was to my mama.

01:15:36.214 --> 01:15:39.149
Kind of husband I want to be.

01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.821
First day I...

01:15:44.889 --> 01:15:48.125
Wound it up for no good reason.

01:15:48.192 --> 01:15:50.394
Just for luck.

01:15:53.431 --> 01:15:55.399
Ray, I made a mistake.

01:15:55.466 --> 01:15:58.335
Which mistake
would that be, huh?

01:15:58.403 --> 01:16:01.538
Being with him or marrying me?

01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:07.411
Would it be easier if I left?

01:16:42.246 --> 01:16:45.648
Is there anything
you like about me, Livy?

01:17:17.047 --> 01:17:18.115
Hi, Chester.

01:17:18.182 --> 01:17:20.817
Mama, it's aunt Livy!

01:17:20.884 --> 01:17:22.285
Hi.

01:17:22.353 --> 01:17:23.487
Hi.

01:17:23.554 --> 01:17:26.123
Oh, Ruth was just

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:27.124
Talking about you.

01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:28.325
And here you are.

01:17:28.392 --> 01:17:29.692
It's like you
read my mind.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.661
See, we don't need
a telephone.

01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:33.096
Yes, we do.

01:17:33.164 --> 01:17:35.632
I was thinking
of you, too, Ruth.

01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:38.435
I was wondering if you wanted
to have this dress.

01:17:38.503 --> 01:17:39.869
As big as
I am now,

01:17:39.937 --> 01:17:41.738
I can't imagine ever
fitting into it again.

01:17:41.805 --> 01:17:44.107
The hat comes with it.

01:17:44.175 --> 01:17:46.343
Can I try it?

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.777
Go on.

01:17:57.522 --> 01:17:58.455
Did Ray tell you...

01:17:58.523 --> 01:17:59.822
I don't know the details.

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:02.259
He and hank had to go over

01:18:02.326 --> 01:18:03.460
To the beet factory.

01:18:07.431 --> 01:18:09.432
Why don't you come in
and sit down?

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.835
For months I've...

01:18:12.903 --> 01:18:15.104
I've written the father
of this baby.

01:18:15.173 --> 01:18:17.874
I thought he died.

01:18:17.941 --> 01:18:19.409
I didn't realize...

01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:22.312
No. He... He's a
flight instructor.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.147
He never
went overseas.

01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:25.515
We met
on furlough.

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:31.521
And for months, I've...
Written him these letters.

01:18:31.589 --> 01:18:33.723
I know it was wrong.

01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:36.660
For the longest time,
I didn't hear from him.

01:18:36.727 --> 01:18:38.928
And as long as I
didn't hear from him,

01:18:38.996 --> 01:18:41.998
I could imagine
that he wanted me.

01:18:42.066 --> 01:18:45.702
I finally
got a letter.

01:18:45.769 --> 01:18:48.905
"Congratulations, Livy.

01:18:48.972 --> 01:18:51.774
"You're a wonderful girl.

01:18:51.842 --> 01:18:55.044
"And I only hope you find
the father of this baby,

01:18:55.112 --> 01:18:58.315
Because I sincerely doubt
that I'm responsible."

01:19:04.088 --> 01:19:06.256
I know that I've hurt Ray.

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:08.225
My sister wants me

01:19:08.292 --> 01:19:10.993
To go back to Denver
to have the baby.

01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:16.032
Might be best if I leave
after Thanksgiving.

01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:28.745
When Ray loves a person,
it's with his whole heart.

01:19:31.014 --> 01:19:35.084
Losing our baby brother
to the war nearly killed him.

01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:40.056
If you're planning on leaving,
do it soon.

01:19:50.401 --> 01:19:51.501
You know, there's one thing

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:54.771
I've never
heard you say.

01:19:54.838 --> 01:19:57.407
And that's how
you feel about Ray.

01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:01.544
<i>Mama?</i>

01:20:06.417 --> 01:20:10.453
Livy? Livy.

01:20:16.527 --> 01:20:18.227
It's all right.

01:20:18.296 --> 01:20:20.029
What happened?

01:20:20.097 --> 01:20:22.165
Calling out.

01:20:22.232 --> 01:20:24.967
Calling out
for your mama.

01:20:34.345 --> 01:20:37.146
After mama died,

01:20:37.214 --> 01:20:41.017
I was so lonely.

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:45.689
I gave my life away,
just to be held.

01:20:45.756 --> 01:20:47.990
By a stranger.

01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:55.565
How could I do that?

01:21:03.207 --> 01:21:05.174
Ray...

01:21:05.242 --> 01:21:09.713
You are such a good...

01:21:17.755 --> 01:21:21.558
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:25.262 --> 01:21:27.063
<i>Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:29.532
Oh, it was so kind of you
to bake us a pie, Livy.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.700
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:21:30.768 --> 01:21:31.968
Livy tells me
you're from California.

01:21:32.035 --> 01:21:33.269
Yes, we are.

01:21:33.337 --> 01:21:34.671
I've never been
to California.

01:21:34.739 --> 01:21:36.172
Livy, can we talk?

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.108
I've never been
to Colorado.

01:21:39.176 --> 01:21:43.112
Um, do you think
you can meet my boyfriend

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.481
Two weeks
from Saturday?

01:21:44.548 --> 01:21:45.081
Sure.

01:21:45.148 --> 01:21:46.783
Perhaps, uh,

01:21:46.851 --> 01:21:48.317
We could go for a drive

01:21:48.386 --> 01:21:49.819
Just to get away from here

01:21:49.887 --> 01:21:50.920
For the afternoon.

01:21:50.988 --> 01:21:51.921
All right.

01:21:51.989 --> 01:21:53.289
What time?

01:21:53.357 --> 01:21:55.324
How's noon?
I'll pick you up here.

01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:58.127
Oh, no. Um, not here, Livy.

01:21:58.195 --> 01:21:59.996
Uh, on the road,

01:22:00.063 --> 01:22:02.799
By the grain
elevators.

01:22:02.867 --> 01:22:04.166
All right.

01:22:04.234 --> 01:22:06.469
Thank you, Livy.

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:13.410
I'm grateful for
all of you, of course,

01:22:13.477 --> 01:22:16.780
But I'd also like to pray that
this war will soon be over.

01:22:16.847 --> 01:22:19.982
And I'm thankful for
the harvest this year.

01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:22.318
God's been
good to us.

01:22:22.386 --> 01:22:24.120
I'm thankful
that the baby's

01:22:24.187 --> 01:22:26.155
Coming and I'm going
to have a cousin.

01:22:26.223 --> 01:22:30.693
I'm grateful that Daniel's
seat beside me isn't empty.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.601
I've...

01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:41.404
I've learned more about love...

01:22:41.472 --> 01:22:45.542
In my six months
with this family

01:22:45.609 --> 01:22:48.044
Than I did in the 25 years
in my father's house.

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.615
I have...

01:22:52.683 --> 01:22:55.752
I have received love here.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.054
And I have received forbearance.

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:03.660
And I thank you.

01:23:05.663 --> 01:23:08.765
I will always remember you.

01:23:08.833 --> 01:23:10.366
Everyone of you.

01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:13.570
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:23:13.637 --> 01:23:14.737
Amen.

01:23:14.805 --> 01:23:16.973
Let's dig in.

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.745
Ray...

01:23:38.812 --> 01:23:42.949
I, uh, have to go say
good-bye to the girls.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:44.951
Oh, that's all right.

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.486
He can stay if he wants.

01:23:46.553 --> 01:23:48.621
It's awful cold.

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:55.728
When you come out here,

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:58.131
I know you saw this
as an agreement

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.732
Between your daddy
and reverend case.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.371
Marrying wasn't
your idea.

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:09.943
I know you may have your mind
set on leaving, but...

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:13.413
I can't let you go without
telling you how I feel.

01:24:19.653 --> 01:24:21.754
I've fallen in love with you.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.962
And I love that baby.

01:24:31.498 --> 01:24:34.767
For me, you're the best
thing that's ever happened.

01:24:34.835 --> 01:24:37.804
Livy, you're a fine
and talented woman.

01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:40.407
You're a pitiful cook,

01:24:40.474 --> 01:24:44.010
But that doesn't matter.
I can do the cookin'.

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:47.880
I know you had your heart set
on going to faraway places,

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.649
But there's a good
bit of history

01:24:49.716 --> 01:24:51.084
Right here
in Otero county.

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.519
If you like Indian
canyons and dugouts,

01:24:53.587 --> 01:24:55.188
I'll help
you find them.

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:58.024
You can dig around
all you want.

01:25:01.128 --> 01:25:03.129
Sound like I'm trying
to sell you something.

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:18.511
That day, when
the preacher married us,

01:25:18.579 --> 01:25:20.947
I forgot the ring.

01:25:24.885 --> 01:25:28.921
I have one now.

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:36.429
Ray, the truth is, I don't know
if I deserve you.

01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:40.766
How do you know this could work?

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:45.205
I know, because...

01:25:45.272 --> 01:25:48.875
Someday you're
gonna forgive yourself.

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:24.210
Hi.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:26:24.278 --> 01:26:25.912
Hi.

01:26:30.751 --> 01:26:32.752
I knew you wouldn't
let us down.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:36.656
Um, Livy,
this is Walter.

01:26:36.723 --> 01:26:39.659
Hello. So nice
to meet you.

01:26:41.495 --> 01:26:42.962
Um, where-where do you...

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:44.697
Oh, uh, we thought
we'd go south

01:26:44.765 --> 01:26:46.999
Where we saw
the swallowtails.

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.536
That's almost to new Mexico.

01:26:49.603 --> 01:26:51.404
Walter's on leave

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:53.206
And he's got a cousin
down that way.

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.340
I thought
we could

01:26:54.408 --> 01:26:55.508
Drop him off.

01:26:55.576 --> 01:26:57.143
You'll freeze.

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:59.179
It's fine.

01:27:01.315 --> 01:27:03.116
Walter's from Idaho.

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:04.784
He's tough.

01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:09.355
Um...

01:27:09.423 --> 01:27:12.024
Well, uh, let's get going.

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:13.393
We have a long drive.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:26.606
Are you insane?

01:27:26.673 --> 01:27:29.275
What are you talking about?

01:27:30.611 --> 01:27:32.278
What did he promise you?

01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:34.680
I don't know what you're
talking about...

01:27:34.748 --> 01:27:36.216
Florie.

01:27:36.283 --> 01:27:38.284
I've seen him on
the work crew.

01:27:38.352 --> 01:27:41.921
Did you make his uniform?

01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:45.992
If you'd rather not
take me and Walter for a drive,

01:27:46.059 --> 01:27:47.860
You should just let
us out here, Livy.

01:27:47.928 --> 01:27:50.029
Florie, stop it!

01:27:50.097 --> 01:27:51.164
You stop it.

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.266
You're just jealous
because he loves me.

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.301
If he loves you,
why would he leave?

01:27:55.369 --> 01:27:56.869
As soon as this
war is over,

01:27:56.937 --> 01:27:57.903
He'll be free.

01:27:57.971 --> 01:27:59.439
If anyone finds out

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:03.643
You helped this man,
you and Rose will be
accused of treason.

01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:07.213
You could go to prison for
the rest of your lives.

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:10.483
Florie, that uniform ties
him not only to you

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:11.884
But to your family.

01:28:11.952 --> 01:28:14.754
To your father
and your mother.

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:22.195
Father and mother have
nothing to do with it.

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.896
Nor does Rose.

01:28:31.838 --> 01:28:33.873
Listen to me--
you're going to go home,

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.142
You're going to burn
every scrap of fabric

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.410
Left from that uniform.

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.844
You're going to
take that bracelet,

01:28:38.912 --> 01:28:40.880
You're going to throw
it into a field.

01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:43.082
Walk away, Florie,
and never look back.

01:28:45.886 --> 01:28:47.220
You're lonely,

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:49.622
And you're reaching out for
something to make it better.

01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:50.990
But you can't do this.

01:28:51.058 --> 01:28:53.059
You'll be paying for it
the rest of your life.

01:28:57.798 --> 01:28:59.098
Florie?

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:00.766
Get out of the truck--
both of you.

01:29:00.834 --> 01:29:03.503
Tell him that it's safer if
you don't travel with him.

01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:12.645
It'll be safer
if you travel alone.

01:29:52.519 --> 01:29:53.919
It's okay. Get down.

01:29:53.987 --> 01:29:55.187
Come here.

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:57.089
Come here.

01:29:57.157 --> 01:29:58.858
Come here. Sit. Stay.

01:29:58.925 --> 01:30:01.261
Stay.

01:30:01.328 --> 01:30:03.162
Walter, let me

01:30:03.230 --> 01:30:04.697
Be Frank with you.

01:30:04.765 --> 01:30:07.367
You'll never make it across
the border dressed as an mp.

01:30:09.703 --> 01:30:11.070
<i>Nein.</i>

01:30:11.138 --> 01:30:13.139
Come with me.

01:30:14.174 --> 01:30:16.342
This way.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.820
My husband's room
is right up these stairs.

01:30:27.888 --> 01:30:30.089
Open the wardrobe
and put on some clothes.

01:30:30.157 --> 01:30:32.592
Leave the clothes that
you're wearing on the floor.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.960
My husband will be home
any minute. Hurry.

01:30:40.867 --> 01:30:42.034
Come on, Franklin.

01:31:08.829 --> 01:31:09.995
Listen...

01:31:13.233 --> 01:31:14.867
Florie loves you.

01:31:14.935 --> 01:31:17.637
Soon this war will be over
and you'll be free.

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:20.206
If you leave now,
how will you find her?

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:26.145
Do you have
something to drink?

01:31:26.213 --> 01:31:27.513
<i>Bitte?</i>

01:31:27.581 --> 01:31:29.482
Yes. I can make some coffee.

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.517
Come on, Franklin.

01:32:01.615 --> 01:32:02.782
Wilson operator.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.116
Operator, could you
please connect me

01:32:04.184 --> 01:32:05.518
To the sheriff's department?

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.286
One moment, please.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.291
Sheriff's Haynes.
Can I help you?

01:32:12.359 --> 01:32:15.261
Sheriff, this is Livy Singleton,
Ray Singleton's wife.

01:32:15.328 --> 01:32:16.562
Yes, ma'am.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.330
I want you to know
that an escaped POW

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:21.000
Has just stolen my truck
and is now headed down route 22.

01:32:21.067 --> 01:32:22.502
He should be running out of gas

01:32:22.569 --> 01:32:24.069
About the time
he hits the bridge.

01:32:24.137 --> 01:32:25.905
He's unarmed, so please
don't hurt him.

01:32:25.972 --> 01:32:27.139
Thank you, Mrs. Singleton.

01:32:27.207 --> 01:32:28.775
We'll put someone on it
right away.

01:32:28.842 --> 01:32:32.344
And officer, I'm in labor.
I need some help.

01:33:15.021 --> 01:33:17.389
Oh, oh.

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:18.658
Livy?

01:33:18.725 --> 01:33:20.760
What in the world
are you doing?

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:23.095
Getting ready
for our baby.

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:28.200
Our baby's coming!
Our baby...

01:33:28.268 --> 01:33:29.802
I'll send Martha
right over!

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.170
Hurry!

01:33:45.151 --> 01:33:47.086
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:11.611
Hey there.

01:34:19.252 --> 01:34:21.420
%% Cheeks of Rose %%

01:34:21.488 --> 01:34:24.624
%% tiny toes %%

01:34:24.691 --> 01:34:29.461
%% has our little baby %%

01:34:30.864 --> 01:34:33.699
%% eyes of blue %%

01:34:33.767 --> 01:34:36.736
%% fingers, too %%

01:34:36.803 --> 01:34:41.140
%% gotta love this baby. %%

01:35:12.238 --> 01:35:14.273
Aw!

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:20.279
Thank you so much.

01:35:21.648 --> 01:35:22.848
This is for you.

01:35:22.916 --> 01:35:23.983
What?

01:35:35.528 --> 01:35:37.196
<i>Butterflies of America.</i>

01:35:37.263 --> 01:35:39.164
Thank you.

01:35:39.232 --> 01:35:40.700
You're welcome.

01:35:40.767 --> 01:35:42.568
Thank you.

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.149
That's right, Danny.

01:35:57.217 --> 01:35:59.518
This was your
granddaddy's watch.

01:35:59.586 --> 01:36:02.054
And someday it's going
to be yours,

01:36:02.122 --> 01:36:06.592
But in the meantime,
I'll just hold on to it for you.

01:36:12.866 --> 01:36:14.000
We got to get going.

01:36:14.067 --> 01:36:15.968
Your mama's set
on a treasure hunt.

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.670
It's not a treasure hunt.

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.839
It's his first
archeological dig.

01:36:19.906 --> 01:36:21.440
For arrowheads, right?

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:24.677
Ready?

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:25.945
Come on, let's go.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.813
Let's go.

01:36:27.881 --> 01:36:29.815
We're going to fly there.

01:38:35.001 --> 01:38:36.815
---The end---
