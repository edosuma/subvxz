00:46.440 --> 00:49.489
The shadow monster woke up.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.650
It saw the boy in the pot
and said:

00:52.720 --> 00:55.246
"Mmm. I'm starving."

00:55.560 --> 00:57.688
"I'm going to eat you up."

00:58.160 --> 01:01.004
So the monster opened
his mouth wide and...

01:02.320 --> 01:04.687
swallowed the little tailor whole.

01:04.879 --> 01:05.961
The boy fell

01:06.120 --> 01:08.361
and fell into a dark cave

01:08.520 --> 01:09.806
filled with slime...

01:12.320 --> 01:13.321
Is that it?

01:14.480 --> 01:16.369
That's all I could come up with.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.768
Well, you'll think of something
tomorrow.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.161
Let's go to bed.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.921
But I'm not sleepy
and I haven't finished it yet.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.169
I know, sweetie, but Mommy's tired
from working all day

01:27.400 --> 01:29.164
and she needs to sleep.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.646
Here, I'll carry you.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.251
God, you're heavy!

01:37.320 --> 01:39.561
Your story needs an ending.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.529
Let's see if I can help.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.490
Let methink...

01:44.720 --> 01:48.281
Remember the scissors the tailor
had given his son?

01:49.800 --> 01:52.610
Well, suddenly he remembered
he still had them.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.043
He took them out
and started cutting.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.443
Snip, snip, snip...

01:58.880 --> 02:01.690
Snip, snip, snip...

02:04.680 --> 02:06.603
And the monster shouted:
"Ouch!"

02:06.880 --> 02:09.008
"Who's cutting me?"
And the little tailor...

02:09.160 --> 02:10.764
I know, I know!

02:11.080 --> 02:12.844
The boy cuts his way out,

02:13.120 --> 02:15.168
makes himself a monster-skin coat

02:15.400 --> 02:18.404
and the arrows couldn't hurt him
any more. I'll finish it right now.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.961
You're going to sleep
or you'll be tired in the morning.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.241
Mom...

02:22.440 --> 02:25.330
We'll get the little boy out
of the monster's belly in the morning.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.804
Don't shut it, Meow is still outside.
He might want to come in.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.803
No dreaming about monsters, okay?

03:20.400 --> 03:21.401
Come!

03:23.040 --> 03:24.041
Come!

05:18.760 --> 05:20.171
Leave her alone, monster!

05:56.120 --> 05:57.246
Let him go!

06:17.400 --> 06:18.481
Mommy!

06:42.240 --> 06:43.241
Mommy!

06:57.560 --> 06:59.324
Mommy, Mommy!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.001
There, there...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.921
It's over, sweetie.
There, there...

07:06.800 --> 07:08.768
The monster came in
through the window.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.890
It wanted to take me away.
It was... It had no face.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.649
There's no monster in here.
It was only a nightmare.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.930
It was only a nightmare.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.321
Don't worry.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.448
- It's over.
- What if he comes back?

07:22.160 --> 07:25.243
If he comes back, close your eyes
and count to five.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.448
When you open them,
he'll be gone, you'll see.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.285
One, two, three, four, five.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.801
"He was a murderer from the beginning,

21:15.560 --> 21:17.608
and did not abide in the truth,

21:18.320 --> 21:20.482
because there is no truth in him.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.721
If ye continue in my word

21:25.720 --> 21:28.246
then ye are my disciples indeed.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.483
And ye shall know the truth,

21:31.480 --> 21:33.642
and the truth will make you free."

21:38.400 --> 21:40.289
Wait for us here.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.609
We can do it here if you like.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.330
You have to say,
"Hail, Mary, full of grace."

22:00.800 --> 22:02.245
Hail, Mary, full of grace.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.925
The Lord is with thee.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.131
When was your last confession?

22:12.920 --> 22:13.921
I don't know.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.606
I don't remember.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.841
That's okay.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.130
Go ahead, tell me.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.442
You needn't be ashamed.

22:27.920 --> 22:28.967
The Lord is good

22:29.200 --> 22:30.804
and always forgives us.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.360
Come on.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.965
It can't be that bad.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.849
Come on, Juan. We're leaving.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.241
Mommy!

34:02.960 --> 34:04.644
Mommy!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.001
Juan...

34:10.199 --> 34:12.168
It's okay, sweetie.
There, there.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.965
It's over.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.966
Please, come in.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.561
Juan.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.121
Juan.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.806
Father Antonio is here to see you.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.603
He doesn't seem to have a fever.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.647
Hi, Juan.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.170
My name is Antonio.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.451
Do you remember me?

35:02.960 --> 35:03.961
Look.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.204
I brought your toy.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.885
I'll leave it here, okay?

35:12.960 --> 35:15.201
Your mother says
you're having trouble sleeping.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.201
Go away.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.804
Why do you say that?

35:21.760 --> 35:23.569
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.688
I had nightmares at your age too.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.010
They aren't nightmares.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.971
What are you scared of?

35:31.280 --> 35:32.361
Witches?

35:33.320 --> 35:34.446
No such thing.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.168
And the bogeyman isn't real either.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.367
My parents told me about him
so I'd finish my dinner.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.006
It's just a story.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.083
You needn't be afraid of stories.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.085
Here's what we'll do:

35:50.320 --> 35:53.767
You tell me what you're scared of,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.849
and I'll tell you what scares me,
okay?

35:59.480 --> 36:02.529
I have a friend I talk to every day
who I can't see.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.005
I'm scared...

36:05.840 --> 36:07.569
my friend won't answer me.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.570
That I'll talk to him
and he won't say anything.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.404
Now it's your turn.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.811
What are you scared of?

36:28.680 --> 36:30.091
Hollowface.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.770
Who is Hollowface?

46:19.800 --> 46:23.043
One, two, three, four...

46:30.280 --> 46:31.725
Mommy, Mommy!

46:35.200 --> 46:36.201
Juan...

47:27.200 --> 47:28.201
How are you?

47:29.240 --> 47:30.321
Everything okay?

47:31.760 --> 47:33.967
No wonder the father ran off.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.086
Did she tell you that?

47:36.760 --> 47:38.000
No.

47:38.880 --> 47:40.882
She speaks only of a presence,

47:41.320 --> 47:43.448
that there's something
inside the boy.

47:44.880 --> 47:48.043
They're both nuts,
the boy and the mother.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.205
They would spook anyone.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.809
She told you more than she told me.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.767
You don't know how to treat women.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.250
Will you help them?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.564
What do you want me to do?

48:02.360 --> 48:05.443
I don't know. Make them think
you got rid of it.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.005
Got rid of what?

48:10.040 --> 48:12.407
We're talking about something
very serious.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.607
It wouldn't have to be official.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.129
It would be like a placebo.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.491
Antonio, you can't perform
such a serious ritual

48:21.720 --> 48:24.246
just to settle the nerves
of a crazy woman.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.289
No matter how pretty she is.

48:27.360 --> 48:30.091
You can't play around
with this stuff, damn it.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.450
Leave them alone.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.367
This is a job for a psychiatrist,

48:39.120 --> 48:40.610
not for us.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.241
Hi, Juan.

52:46.360 --> 52:47.486
How are you?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.121
Remember me?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.041
Juan.

53:12.120 --> 53:13.121
Juan.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.248
Mommy, I'm having fun!

53:15.480 --> 53:16.481
We're leaving.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.403
We can't be here.

53:18.680 --> 53:19.681
Let's go.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.401
Come on.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.281
Juan...

58:20.520 --> 58:21.567
Sit down.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.410
Come with me, Juan.

58:39.720 --> 58:40.721
Lie down.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.968
We're going to pray together.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.604
I'm going to say a prayer

58:55.440 --> 58:58.444
and repeat after me, all right?

58:58.800 --> 59:02.088
Mommy says you're going to make
Hollowface go away.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.281
That's right.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.046
Jesus will come,
he'll grab Hollowface

59:06.320 --> 59:07.321
and poof.

59:08.240 --> 59:11.244
He'll throw him into a pit so deep
he'll never get out.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.204
But Hollowface can fly.

59:13.520 --> 59:15.284
Juan, keep quiet
and obey the father.

59:16.080 --> 59:17.127
Cross yourselves.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.606
Give me your hand.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.922
"You, Lord, are my refuge.

59:35.160 --> 59:37.845
He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

59:38.000 --> 59:39.889
and from the noisome pestilence."

59:41.160 --> 59:42.161
Repeat it.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.521
"You, Lord, are my refuge.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.326
He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

59:47.440 --> 59:48.885
and from the noisome..."

59:49.040 --> 59:50.565
"From the noisome pestilence."

59:50.800 --> 59:53.041
"From the noisome pestilence."

59:54.080 --> 59:56.560
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

59:57.280 --> 59:59.328
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day."

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.161
Juan.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.601
Please.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.920
I don't want to.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.286
That's all right.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.803
We'll try something else.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.486
I'll pray

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.091
and you repeat it to yourself
in silence.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.080
Close your eyes.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.361
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.968
nor for the arrow that flieth by day."

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.686
I can't.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.571
I can't do it.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.726
I can't expel him
if I don't know who he is.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.010
You know who he is, don't you?

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.690
He has no face.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.202
His face is hidden.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.050
I can't see it.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.490
You can't see it because
he's wearing a hood, right?

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.281
Close your eyes.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.444
Try to imagine his face.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.521
Take it off.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.290
Take off his hood.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.561
Father, that's enough.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.806
Good, Juan.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.681
Good.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.841
He's there.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.441
Where, Juan?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.481
There.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.160
Where is he?

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.611
There's nothing there.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.605
What do you see?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.961
He's gone.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.610
It's only a statue.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.481
Luisa.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.560
You can't help us.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.848
There's nothing you can do.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.370
It's only a statue.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.043
You imagined the whole thing.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.721
Luisa!

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.521
Luisa...

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.121
Tell me what you saw.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.490
Mommy, where are we going?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.443
I don't know. Far away.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.808
Juan, help me.
Close your suitcase.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.089
Do you think he'll follow us?

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.965
No, because we're going far away.
Do you understand?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.968
You saw him too, didn't you?

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.242
Juan, I didn't see anything.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.564
You hear me? Nothing.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.367
He says he wants to talk to you.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.766
Mommy!

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.521
Mommy!

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.680
Mommy!

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.241
One, two, three,

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.404
four, five.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.401
There you'll stay forever.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.761
You know who.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.282
I don't know what
you're talking about, son.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.121
Yes, you do.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.641
No.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.566
It can't be.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.447
You said I made him up.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.161
That I was dreaming.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.406
You lied to me.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.081
I'm sorry.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.610
I'm so sorry.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.402
He's hurting Mia.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.563
I was only trying to protect you.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.241
From what?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.001
Son...

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.640
Forgive me.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.566
Tell me.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.522
I'm sorry, I had to lie to you.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.930
He came to take you that night.
It wasn't a nightmare.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.645
Where's the boy?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.410
Leave her alone, monster!

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.611
Don't be afraid, son.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.451
You look like me.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.926
Mommy!

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.641
Mommy!

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.251
Help me, son!

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.081
Help me!
