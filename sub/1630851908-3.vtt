the knot soon, or what?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.101
- Do not step to me because
it’s going to be the

00:17.143 --> 00:18.602
last fucking person you step to.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.062
You’re always trying
to jump on any argument

00:20.104 --> 00:21.814
you possibly could
to try to get clout.

00:21.856 --> 00:22.898
You’re disrespectful,

00:22.940 --> 00:24.316
you’re desperate for attention.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.194
- From who, though?
- To me and to my girl.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.572
- That’s who, bitch!
Shut the fuck up!

00:29.613 --> 00:32.491
You’re fucking eighty pounds,
you cannot defend yourself.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.702
- Okay.
- So you would imagine

00:34.744 --> 00:36.412
you’re in Tampa Bay,

00:36.454 --> 00:38.456
you’re riding on this
bad-ass Tiki boat.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.292
- We’re like dolphin watching,
we’re doing body shots.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.712
But we’re actually
sitting here for a full-on war

00:44.795 --> 00:48.382
between Shiva and Murphy,
and we’re stuck on this like

00:48.424 --> 00:51.927
15-by-15 fucking floating
piece of plywood.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.057
- You just like, popped off on
her out of nowhere...

00:57.099 --> 00:58.267
- I did not...
No, it wasn’t out of nowhere.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.269
- She was digging and digging
and digging at me.
- Listen.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.937
- Put the ego down for a second.
- There’s no ego.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.355
She’s digging at me, dude.
I’m not wrong.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.857
- Tell me I’m wrong again...
- Shh, listen.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.233
- I’m not telling
you you’re wrong.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.985
I’m not telling
you you’re wrong.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.696
When Brianna was
popping off on Shiva,

01:10.738 --> 01:16.368
I felt a little bit torn with
what to do in that situation.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.622
I did feel bad, but at the
same time Brianna was right,

01:19.663 --> 01:22.208
just not her reaction, so...

01:22.249 --> 01:26.003
Shiva comes up and is, like,
asking relationship questions.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.923
Everyone’s always like got
their nose in my business,

01:28.964 --> 01:30.174
and it’s just super frustrating.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.886
- Give her like five
minutes to calm down.

01:33.928 --> 01:38.098
- You know how she is.
- [Shiva]: I didn’t do anything.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.850
To yell at me like that?

01:39.892 --> 01:42.269
She just embarrassed me
in front of all of you guys.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.396
I’ve always been
a good friend to them.

01:44.438 --> 01:49.443
So to have her cuss me out,
basically scream in my face,

01:49.485 --> 01:51.028
it’s fucked up, dude.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.781
I don’t really
get confrontational.

01:53.823 --> 01:57.701
So obviously,
I didn’t say a lot.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.245
I just cried.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.163
I’m like,
genuinely upset right now.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.998
- No, I’m sorry.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.501
It’s okay, Shiva. It's okay.
Come here, it’s fine.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.504
Come here, you’re fine.
You’re fine. It’s okay.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.005

you’re 80 pounds.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.049
- I know, I know.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.801
- Listen,
she didn’t mean it that way.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.886
I think she’s just frustrated
because she feels

02:15.928 --> 02:18.597
like everybody doesn’t have
our back all the time.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.474
- I didn’t say anything.
- I know, and really it just

02:20.516 --> 02:23.102
stems down to me, Brianna,
Summer, and Marissa,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.813

so damn emotional.

Take a fucking chill pill.

Have a shot,
fucking get a tampon,

02:31.777 --> 02:33.696

you need to do.

going on,

been priceless if you

03:27.416 --> 03:29.168

tattoos when I was like 18,

I guess.

Yeah. So did you and Brianna
talk more about what happened?

the whole situation with like

03:42.097 --> 03:43.974
Shiva asking about like

03:44.016 --> 03:46.393
when we’re planning
to like tie the knot...

I wasn’t even there for it.

Yeah, she was like, "Oh, like
when are you guys planning

03:49.563 --> 03:51.106
on getting married?"
Or something like that

03:51.148 --> 03:53.150
because, we were talking
about how long we were together,

03:53.192 --> 03:55.152
and then she like, kind of
popped off on Shiva,

03:55.194 --> 03:57.154
because she was like, "Whenever
I feel like it," basically.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.406

it’s really nobody’s business

03:59.448 --> 04:01.158

04:01.200 --> 04:03.953

stay in their lane with it.

People tend to speculate about
me and Brianna’s relationship

04:07.039 --> 04:10.042
a lot because they feel like
we go out and like have fun,

04:10.084 --> 04:12.586
and we’re not up each other’s
asses the entire time.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.964

a lot of people

04:21.887 --> 04:24.223
very sneaky and kind
of like goes around,

04:24.264 --> 04:27.267
and she’s never like in with
any confrontation or drama,

04:27.309 --> 04:29.269
but she definitely
feeds the drama.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.230
Yeah, I feel like maybe
she felt embarrassed

04:31.271 --> 04:33.023
because she was getting
called out in front

04:33.065 --> 04:34.149
- of everybody or something.
- She said she was embarrassed,

- it’s with them, every time.
- Yeah.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.339

they really can’t stand

have a baby next month.

are not easy,

somebody that I can

07:44.173 --> 07:46.008
see spending my life with.

And so the fact that it’s
a couple hour car ride,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.639
it is what it is, and
all lesbians know that

07:52.681 --> 07:54.725
sometimes that’s
what you got to do.

conversation with them of,

08:32.262 --> 08:34.890

And I don’t want to have to
hide who I love or who I am.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.230
If I’m being
completely honest,

08:41.271 --> 08:45.692
I do not ever see myself telling
my grandparents I’m gay.

and she’s like your grandparents

08:59.039 --> 09:01.625
are from a different generation.
You have to tell them.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.585
You have to sit them down
and tell them.

Honestly, if it wasn’t you,

38:04.282 --> 38:05.993
I don’t think we’d be
doing this at all.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.661
- Because it’s a lot.

38:07.703 --> 38:08.662
- You still seem nervous...
- You’re looking at them like...

38:08.704 --> 38:09.663
She’s like...

38:09.705 --> 38:10.622
[laughing]

38:21.258 --> 38:22.801
You’ll be okay.

38:22.843 --> 38:27.222
It might not seem like it
now but it will be.

38:27.264 --> 38:29.766
- I want to give them
a heads up.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.059
Okay.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.353
I’m just gonna text them.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.774
Are you texting your
grandparents right now?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.109
What do have typed out?

38:39.151 --> 38:40.777
So I put the letter
in the mailbox

38:40.819 --> 38:44.156
and at first,
I’m feeling great about it.

38:44.197 --> 38:46.658
I feel like there’s
a weight lifted.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.452
And then it starts to sink in.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.537
Holy crap, what did I just do?

38:50.579 --> 38:52.497
And I start freaking out.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.541
I clearly did not think
this through all the way.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.210
I said, "Hi. I love you.
I just sent you a letter.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.047
I just want to make
sure you guys get it.

39:00.088 --> 39:05.844
Text me or give me a call when
it gets there."

39:09.264 --> 39:12.893
She said,
"What’s the letter about?"

39:12.934 --> 39:14.978
"Just something I wanted to
talk to you guys about,

39:15.020 --> 39:17.939
but I thought it would
be easier to write out."

39:17.981 --> 39:19.191
Yeah.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.617
I immediately then start
regretting the decision

39:28.658 --> 39:30.744
because I’m now thinking
of all the people

39:30.786 --> 39:34.414
that it’s going to impact and
how this is real,

39:34.456 --> 39:38.085
and yeah, I definitely have my
regrets at this point.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.092
I’m freaking out.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.052
No, you’re okay.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.846
I know you’re freaking out, but
I promise it’s going to be okay.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.681
[phone rings]

39:51.723 --> 39:54.226
- Whoa. Do you want to answer
this right now or no?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.445
[cheering]

40:05.487 --> 40:07.697
Marissa, it’s seven o’clock.
Get up.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.990
- I cannot do this.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.117
They get under
each other’s skin

40:10.158 --> 40:11.243
and then I’m just in the middle.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.786
I’m going to kill somebody.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.080
[laughing]

40:15.122 --> 40:16.206
I think we both like
each other a lot.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.624
- It’s like her twin.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.584
[Brianna]: Two Olivias is
not always a good thing.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.920
I heard your girlfriend
was cheating on you.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.589
- Did y’all fuck since then?
- Yo. What’s the conversation?

40:24.631 --> 40:26.174
[Summer]: That you’re a fucking
whore!

40:26.216 --> 40:27.843
Oh!
