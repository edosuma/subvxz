18:25.567 --> 18:27.100
HEY, WATCH IT!

18:27.100 --> 18:30.400
I'M NOT A PIÑATA!

18:31.400 --> 18:32.467
[GASPING]

18:32.467 --> 18:33.567
IT'S GOT TO BE THEM
THIS TIME.

18:33.567 --> 18:35.667
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
LEFT IN THE HOTEL.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.600
BUT MY TRAP'S
ALREADY BEEN SPRUNG.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.567
WHAT DO WE DO?

18:38.567 --> 18:40.133
HERE'S AN IDEA. HIDE.

18:40.133 --> 18:41.967
MURIEL,
DON'T MOVE.

18:41.967 --> 18:42.934
Muriel: OH, YEAH!

18:42.934 --> 18:47.133
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE RIVIERA!

18:50.500 --> 18:52.367
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THESE LEAVES?

18:52.367 --> 18:56.600
MUST'VE BLOWN IN THE WINDOW
FROM THE PARK ACROSS
THE STREET.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.400
TOLD YA.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.800
CHECK IT OUT.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.567
LOOK AT ALL THOSE
JEWELS.

19:01.567 --> 19:02.934
THAT'LL BUY US
A MONTH IN HAWAII.

19:02.934 --> 19:07.934
OR IF WE BUDGET OUR MONEY
CAREFULLY, 4 WEEKS.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.667
WE GOT IT ALL ON TAPE.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.467
YOU WERE RIGHT. SORRY.

19:12.467 --> 19:13.567
OH, A CAMERA.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.934
THIS'LL BE GREAT
FOR OUR TRIP TO HAWAII.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.500
I TAKE MY SORRY BACK.

19:18.934 --> 19:19.800
WHAT WAS THAT?

19:19.800 --> 19:21.700
WHO'S BEHIND THE SOFA?

19:21.700 --> 19:23.600
Maddie: MICE?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.767
OH, OK.

19:24.767 --> 19:27.200
COME OUT OF THERE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
WELL, YOU'RE CAUGHT.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.300
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.967
STEP BACK, LITTLE
BLOND PEOPLES.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.000
I'M HERE TO CLEAR
THE NAME OF

19:37.000 --> 19:38.834
ESTEBAN JULIO
RICARDO MONTOYA
DEL ROSA RAMIREZ.

19:38.834 --> 19:43.800
SON OF DIEGO ESTEBAN

19:43.800 --> 19:45.200
Muriel: BAD DOG.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.834
NO-O-O-O-O!

19:48.300 --> 19:50.834
AND HIS WIFE GLADYS.

19:50.834 --> 19:55.767
HEY, HOT SHOT,
WHEN YOU GET OUT
OF THE SLAMMER,

19:55.767 --> 19:58.133
CALL ME, HUH?

19:59.700 --> 20:02.233
All: AA-A-A-A-H!

20:06.400 --> 20:09.800
ESTEBAN, I HOPE YOU KNOW
I NEVER SUSPECTED YOU.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.100
THANK YOU, SIR.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.300
I NEVER SUSPECTED
YOU, EITHER.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.800
AND THANK YOU,
MY LITTLE FRIENDS.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.400
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE DOUBTED YOU.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.600
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.900
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.233
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING,

20:20.233 --> 20:21.600
PUTTING YOURSELVES
IN DANGER?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.500
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE US.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.600
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.300
IF YOU HADN'T LET
YOUR IMAGINATIONS

20:26.300 --> 20:27.400
RUN AWAY WITH YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.834
WE WOULD'VE BELIEVED YOU
WHEN IT REALLY MATTERED.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.233
IT'S LIKE THE BOY
WHO CRIED WOLF.

20:31.233 --> 20:32.800
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A WOLF?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.467
AREN'T YOU HAPPY
WE CAUGHT THEM?

20:35.467 --> 20:36.500
NOT THE POINT!

20:36.500 --> 20:39.600
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A $10,000 REWARD.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.667
MY BOYS!

20:42.767 --> 20:43.967
WELL, EXCUSE ME,

20:43.967 --> 20:48.500
BUT I'M THE ONE THAT
FELL ON THOSE DIRT BAGS.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.367
YEAH, BUT I'M THE ONE
THAT SET THE TRAP.

20:54.367 --> 20:55.834
SEE?

20:55.834 --> 20:57.567
BUT IVANA'S THE ONE
WHO CUT THE ROPE.

20:57.567 --> 20:59.567
WELL, I GUESS
WHOEVER OWNS THIS DOG

20:59.567 --> 21:02.100
IS GOING TO BE
VERY, VERY RICH.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.300
DON'T BE MAD, SNOOKUMS!

21:04.300 --> 21:06.667
MOMMY'S HOME!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.000
LIFE ISN'T FAIR.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.934
AAH!

21:11.934 --> 21:13.934
THEN AGAIN...

21:23.500 --> 21:25.700
SO, IVANA, TELL LONDON
HOW YOU FELT

21:25.700 --> 21:28.300
ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND.

21:29.734 --> 21:30.967
THAT IS SO HURTFUL.

21:30.967 --> 21:33.200
I DO SO LOVE YOU.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.000
PLEASE.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.600
IT'S IVANA'S TURN TO VENT.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.834
I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN!

21:42.834 --> 21:44.400
[GRRR]

21:44.400 --> 21:45.600

21:45.600 --> 21:46.700
[WHINES]

21:46.700 --> 21:49.000
I'LL SPEND MORE
QUALITY TIME WITH YOU.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.834
[WHIMPERING]

21:52.367 --> 21:53.200
