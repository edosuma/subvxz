02:49.780 --> 02:51.140
Ah!

03:00.900 --> 03:03.180
Daniel?

03:06.060 --> 03:08.940
Please... Please don't...

03:30.820 --> 03:32.100
Ah!

04:27.380 --> 04:29.380
Urgh.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.980
Felix.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.660
Open it.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.580
Do you know what they'll do to me
if I do that?

05:53.580 --> 05:55.740
Do you know what I'll do to you
if you don't?

05:55.740 --> 05:57.220
Now open it, Nicholson.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.460
Hurry up.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.060
Come on, move!

06:20.060 --> 06:22.220
Armed police!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.100
Armed police!

07:02.460 --> 07:06.140
Hundreds of police officers raided
several addresses across London

07:06.140 --> 07:09.620
and the Home Counties yesterday
in an operation aimed at smashing

07:09.620 --> 07:12.700
one of Britain's most notorious
crime gangs.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.580
Senior members of the Nicholson
Syndicate were among 15 people

07:16.580 --> 07:19.380
arrested, including accountant
Felix Nicholson.

07:19.380 --> 07:23.300
Almost £300,000
in cash, a handgun, shotguns and

07:23.300 --> 07:27.380
other weapons were recovered after
years of painstaking investigation.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.300
Several... Morning. Hm... business
addresses were also raided...

07:30.300 --> 07:31.780
Morning, babe.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.940
Come here, you.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.140
You all right?

07:38.140 --> 07:40.220
Yeah. Yeah?

07:40.220 --> 07:42.220
All right? Morning, trouble.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.820
Hey, you all right?

07:45.860 --> 07:48.500
All right, be honest - how
much sleep did you get last night?

07:48.500 --> 07:49.620
Loads.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.060
Oh, really,
cos it doesn't look like it.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.540
I hope you weren't on your bloody
phone texting till all hours.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.060
Now, here, have some of that.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.660
What even is this?

07:57.660 --> 07:59.220
Try it and see.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.860
Go on, you'll love it.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.820
What time did you get home?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.900
Yeah, Dad.
How much sleep did you get?

08:09.900 --> 08:11.740
Yeah, all right, cheeky.

08:11.740 --> 08:14.820
Look, I've got to head back
in a bit, I just come home to shower
and change.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.180
You need sleep. And I will get some.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.500
Look, I'll sneak off later today,
I'll grab a few hours.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.700
Don't you worry.

08:32.299 --> 08:34.179
Yo, mate, what's up?

08:36.260 --> 08:39.020
Why? What have you been doing?

08:44.780 --> 08:46.620
No way...

08:47.620 --> 08:49.420
No way, no way.

08:49.420 --> 08:52.340
No, no, no, no. That's GCHQ, mate!
You don't do that!

08:53.780 --> 08:56.860
You of all people, you know
not to mess...

08:56.860 --> 09:00.020
They can lay a trace back,
get all "active response continuum",

09:00.020 --> 09:02.900
bloodhound you down,
find you and fry you!

09:09.060 --> 09:10.700
How big?

09:12.420 --> 09:15.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what does
that even mean, "Hard Sun"?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.300
Morning, sir. Morning.

09:35.660 --> 09:38.100
Hey. Morning, all.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.180
Morning, sir.
Morning, governor. Guv. Boss.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.220
What's new? Apart from
Keith's shirt, apparently.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.820
That is a courageous selection,
Keith.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.740
Yes. Thanks. So what've we
heard about the Nicholsons?

09:50.740 --> 09:52.060
No, not a lot.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.460
It was, er,
it was date night last night.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.380
Massive raid - nicked the
entire firm, more or less.

09:57.380 --> 10:00.020
Nice. Right, anything else?

10:00.020 --> 10:01.340
We have a visitor.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.140
Morning, Charlie boy.
Spare me a minute?

10:06.900 --> 10:10.220
Yeah, of course, sir. Absolutely.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.540
Elaine Renko, DCI Charlie Hicks.

10:18.540 --> 10:22.380
DCI Hicks, Elaine is joining us
as your new DI.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.100
Oh, right.
Well, pleased to meet you.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.340
And you.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.140
So, you met everyone?

10:29.140 --> 10:31.340
Well, I said a quick "hello."

10:31.340 --> 10:33.260
You had breakfast?

10:33.260 --> 10:36.660
Not really, no. I had a bit of
first day nerves, to be honest.

10:36.660 --> 10:40.300
Oh, well, let's do that,
let's... let's get some breakfast.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.340
Yeah.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.940
Just leave me alone!

11:14.620 --> 11:16.580
And go and do something useful!

11:41.260 --> 11:44.900
Help! Help!

12:15.180 --> 12:18.620
You're the Renko that got stabbed,
right? The house burnt down.

12:18.620 --> 12:19.780
All that?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.620
That'd be me, yeah.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.780
Ooh!

12:22.780 --> 12:24.300
Bad day.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.020
Well, it was definitely up there.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.420
So, er, so where are you living now?

12:31.420 --> 12:33.100
Do you know the Caliburn Hotel?

12:33.100 --> 12:36.740
Blimey! Well, I hope you
brought your own bed sheets.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.700
They actually look after me.
I did them a favour once.

12:39.700 --> 12:43.660
And the guy who stabbed you,
they... they got him, right?

12:43.660 --> 12:46.300
They got him. And he's, er...?

12:46.300 --> 12:47.940
Yeah. He is. Yeah.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.420
So why are you here?

12:56.820 --> 12:58.540
I'm sorry?

12:58.540 --> 13:00.660
I mean, er,
why are you stuck here with me?

13:01.820 --> 13:03.260
I don't know.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.380
I have no idea.
I just go where they send me. Why?

13:08.380 --> 13:09.740
Oh, no reason.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.060
Well, it's just I'm sure there's
no secret we've had a vacancy.

13:18.180 --> 13:22.780
Listen, if I may,
I know you've lost Alex Butler

13:22.780 --> 13:24.220
and I know you were close.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.420
We were, yeah. We were very close.

13:27.420 --> 13:29.500
It must've been hard on everyone.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.700
It still is. He was a great man.

13:31.700 --> 13:32.860
He was loved.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.900
It's just that, I want you to know

13:36.900 --> 13:39.820
it's not my intention
to replace him.

13:41.180 --> 13:46.940
Oh, good, cos I want you to know
that nobody could.

14:19.340 --> 14:20.500
Morning.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.300
Name's Lloyd Hammond.
Threw himself from the 15th floor.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.660
What do we know about him?

14:24.660 --> 14:27.420
Nothing much.
Long-term sickness beneficiary.

14:27.420 --> 14:28.940
Oh, what's his problem?

14:28.940 --> 14:30.220
Spectrum disorder.

14:30.220 --> 14:31.260
What, Asperger's?

14:32.460 --> 14:34.180
What, does that square with suicide?

14:34.180 --> 14:36.660
People at the milder end
are actually at an increased risk.

14:36.660 --> 14:40.620
Yeah? Yeah. I've got an interest
in mental health issues.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.700
Of course.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.620
That makes sense.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.700
But I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know, am I?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.780
Hello again.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.900
Hello again. How's it going?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.420
He, er, leave a note?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.580
No.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.780
What, and SOCO found what,
kiddie porn on a laptop?

15:23.780 --> 15:25.740
They did. But he's not
on a register?

15:25.740 --> 15:27.700
No previous offending of any kind.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.420
Right. So what're we thinking?

15:30.420 --> 15:34.700
What? He finally gives in
to curiosity, temptation,

15:34.700 --> 15:38.020
can't live with the guilt,
takes a running jump?

15:39.140 --> 15:41.620
What do you think, DI Renko?
Any thoughts?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.980
How did we get into this?

16:12.980 --> 16:14.060
It was on.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.580
It was on? No password?

16:15.580 --> 16:17.060
No password.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.980
Does that not seem a bit off to you?

16:18.980 --> 16:21.780
Possibly. Possibly not.
He did live alone.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.900
Absolutely, yeah.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.500
But he does give off
a kind of paranoid vibe, though.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.180
Get the new girl!

16:30.180 --> 16:32.900
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed
to play in the sandpit?

16:34.940 --> 16:36.820
You should've mentioned.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.940
They were just taking your measure,
that's all.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.620
You should take it as a compliment.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.900
And you? Is that what you're doing?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.740
Nah. No need.

16:52.740 --> 16:56.060
Listen, you couldn't give me
a lift somewhere, could you?

16:56.060 --> 16:59.060
It's just I've got an errand to run.
Won't take long.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.460
Yeah.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.660
Hi. Hello.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.940
Cup of tea or something?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.180
No, no, I can't stop long.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.700
I just, er...
Well, I popped by on the off-chance.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.740
So, did you get in?

17:30.740 --> 17:32.300
Well, today's the day, isn't it?

17:32.300 --> 17:34.020
Yeah, I got in.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.500
I knew it!

17:35.500 --> 17:36.900
I can't believe I did it.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.180
I can.

17:38.180 --> 17:41.780
Well, the good news is, you can't
have too many psychologists.

17:41.780 --> 17:42.820
Ha-ha ha!

17:42.820 --> 17:44.820
Yeah, there's a shortage,
apparently.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.740
Anyway, how's... how's Owen?

17:50.180 --> 17:51.500
Bumping along.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.820
Is he talking about his dad yet?

17:55.820 --> 17:59.660
I keep thinking counselling
might help. I don't know.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.060
Open him up or something?

18:01.060 --> 18:02.620
Yeah, right.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.700
I mean, when he was this age,
he used to tell me everything.

18:05.700 --> 18:09.660
I mean, literally everything, like
"Mum, where does wind come from?"

18:09.660 --> 18:12.500
"Can we get a fish?
Do dogs lay eggs?"

18:13.700 --> 18:15.220
Do you want me to talk to him?

18:16.540 --> 18:18.540
I know he'd love to see you.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.460
Yeah. Well, me, too.

18:23.780 --> 18:28.540
Anyway, look, reason I, er,
stopped by... cos, well...

18:28.540 --> 18:30.260
We don't need your money, Charlie.

18:30.260 --> 18:33.540
Well, then, you're laughing,
because it's not mine. I nicked it.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.980
Honestly,
I don't need taking care of.

18:38.980 --> 18:43.900
I know that. I need to feel
like I'm doing something.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.580
So you do me a favour, help me out.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.420
So, how are we doing?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.780
Well, Elaine thought it might be
an idea to check out

20:14.780 --> 20:18.340
sealed records, so we did and it
turns out the victim's got a teenage

20:18.340 --> 20:21.860
conviction for hacking -
sealed cos he was a minor.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.620
Yeah? Well, who did he hack?

20:23.620 --> 20:26.940
NASA. NASA! Who hacks NASA?!

20:26.940 --> 20:29.420
Well, he wanted to expose the global
conspiracy to hush up

20:29.420 --> 20:31.900
the existence
of extra-terrestrial life.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.700
The point is, Hammond knew his way
around computer security.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.180
So the last thing he's going to do
is leave incriminating material

20:37.180 --> 20:39.220
just lying around waiting
for us to find.

20:39.220 --> 20:41.900
Even if he's got a proclivity
in that direction, which he doesn't.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.340
Time of death's about 10.30am.

20:44.340 --> 20:47.900
Tech forensics say the porn
was downloaded at 10.27am.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.460
There's no trace of semen,

20:49.460 --> 20:52.220
no secondary signs of
recent sexual activity.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.460
So we're supposed to believe
that he downloaded, masturbated,

20:55.460 --> 20:58.420
cleaned up, was burnt up by guilt
and topped himself off,

20:58.420 --> 20:59.900
all in about five minutes flat.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.420
Which suggests somebody actually
did throw him out the window,

21:02.420 --> 21:04.300
then did a bodged job
of covering up.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.420
No sign of forced entry,

21:05.420 --> 21:08.380
so Hammond most likely knew
and trusted his killer.

21:09.660 --> 21:10.900
Right...

21:12.140 --> 21:14.060
So, motive?

21:14.060 --> 21:17.260
Thing is, none of the
classic motives seems to apply.

21:17.260 --> 21:20.100
Hammond's got no money to speak of.
He's a near hermit.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.860
Never seems to have hurt anyone,
which excludes revenge.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.740
So I'm thinking, a man like that,

21:25.740 --> 21:28.620
how many actual human beings
does he even know and trust?

21:29.620 --> 21:31.980
One name keeps coming up.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.500
Sunny Ramachandran.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.140
Hacktivist. Kill the bankers.
End capitalism.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.020
Starbucks is genocide and all that.

21:39.020 --> 21:42.580
Hammond and Ramachandran
have history - common causes.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.220
Say Hammond's been sniffing
around his old haunts -

21:48.220 --> 21:50.100
GCHQ, NASA, wherever -

21:50.100 --> 21:51.820
looking for ET,

21:51.820 --> 21:54.540
he finds something and he tells
his friend Ramachandran.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.660
Who kills him for it. Why?

21:57.660 --> 22:00.660
Maybe Hammond wants to keep
it between mates,

22:00.660 --> 22:02.100
but Ramachandran doesn't.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.340
He wants to go all Wikileaks on it.

22:04.340 --> 22:05.500
Or maybe the opposite.

22:06.820 --> 22:08.020
How does that work?

22:08.020 --> 22:10.660
It turns out Ramachandran's
not exactly the purest of pure.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.260
His name came up in an insider
trading investigation

22:13.260 --> 22:15.620
a few years ago. For doing what?

22:15.620 --> 22:19.420
Corporate hacking. Accessing
insider information to order.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.380
For money? For money.

22:21.380 --> 22:25.060
All right, so the dead bloke
is doing his hacking,

22:25.060 --> 22:27.340
whilst looking for little green men.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.660
So what are you saying?

22:28.660 --> 22:30.900
What, he stumbles
across something accidentally?

22:30.900 --> 22:35.100
Yeah. Something so valuable that
Sunny Ramachandran kills him for it.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.660
Well, any offers
on what sort of thing?

22:37.660 --> 22:40.500
I don't know, but if Ramachandran
was going to sell this information,

22:40.500 --> 22:42.700
he's not going to do it
from a computer.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.940
It leaves a trail and it leaves it
open to other hackers.

22:45.940 --> 22:49.220
He's going to use physical media -
CD, DVD, maybe.

22:49.220 --> 22:52.460
But usually a USB memory stick,
a flash drive.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.740
So, we need a search warrant...

22:57.740 --> 23:01.660
Well, we've got no evidence.
It'd be a fishing expedition.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.140
No, we need to assume that
Ramachandran's actually going

23:04.140 --> 23:06.220
to meet the person
that he's selling it to.

23:06.220 --> 23:09.020
It's his MO.
It's what he's done before.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.060
Right, well, we need
all eyes on Ramachandran.

23:12.060 --> 23:13.100
Catch him in the act.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.740
All right, three teams.

23:15.740 --> 23:19.980
Keith, Mishal, it's your lucky day,
you're up first.

23:19.980 --> 23:23.780
Renko, get some rest,
we'll take the late watch.

23:26.380 --> 23:28.140
Have you got a minute?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.060
Absolutely. Come in.

23:30.060 --> 23:33.300
Kick off your shoes, loosen
your tie, have a drink.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.740
So, how's Renko working out?

23:42.100 --> 23:45.180
Yeah, great, yeah.

23:45.180 --> 23:46.780
Is she working for you?

23:48.060 --> 23:50.420
Absolutely not.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.940
No, to the best of my knowledge,
this is a straightforward transfer.

23:53.940 --> 23:56.260
No agenda.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.660
No agenda?

24:06.980 --> 24:08.780
The words, "It is not true."

24:08.780 --> 24:11.660
"It is not" were overheard
by residents of houses

24:11.660 --> 24:15.540
backing onto the canal
just before the gunshot was heard.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.820
They're presumed to be
DCI Butler's last words,

24:20.820 --> 24:22.540
or words spoken by his killer.

24:24.420 --> 24:28.180
Cause of death -
single gunshot to the head,

24:28.180 --> 24:31.220
fired from a distance
of perhaps five feet.

24:33.260 --> 24:34.460
A good shot.

24:36.140 --> 24:39.580
Which seems more indicative
of a professional assassination

24:39.580 --> 24:44.300
than a crime of passion, but due to
the clandestine sexual nature

24:44.300 --> 24:48.220
of DCI Hicks's relationship
with DCI Butler's wife,

24:48.220 --> 24:51.980
we can assume that DCI Hicks
would've known he risked becoming

24:51.980 --> 24:56.740
a suspect in DCI Butler's death
and staged the crime accordingly.

24:58.500 --> 25:02.820
At times, DCI Hicks seems anxious.

25:02.820 --> 25:06.100
Scared, even.

25:06.100 --> 25:11.020
He doesn't seem to me
like a man with nothing to hide.

25:11.020 --> 25:13.380
But when he claimed to have
loved DCI Butler,

25:13.380 --> 25:15.940
there's no question that
I believed him.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.700
Actually, it might have been

25:21.700 --> 25:24.220
the only true thing he said to me
all day.

26:11.460 --> 26:15.620
Your name's Musa.
You're working here illegally.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.660
Yeah.

26:17.660 --> 26:20.340
See, I know everything about you.

26:20.340 --> 26:24.860
I know everything about your wife
and your daughters.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.740
Now all I need from you
is a pass key

26:27.740 --> 26:30.340
and for you to keep your mouth shut.

26:30.340 --> 26:33.860
You do that,
you never have to see me again.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.300
Hello, Daniel.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.140
Hello, Mum.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.020
Is he ever coming out of there?

29:24.340 --> 29:26.300
How've you been keeping?

29:38.260 --> 29:40.660
So anyway, I started a new job...

29:45.780 --> 29:47.980
...which means I can come
and see you.

29:51.140 --> 29:52.460
If you'd like that?

30:05.420 --> 30:07.180
Do you like these?

30:10.220 --> 30:13.980
I mean, I-I assumed you like them.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.500
I'm sorry, I...

30:22.900 --> 30:24.420
..I don't know.

30:27.220 --> 30:31.660
I suppose I should know, but I don't
know how I would know, you know?

30:43.020 --> 30:44.540
Anyway...

30:44.540 --> 30:46.060
It's OK.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.260
I like them.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.100
OK.

30:59.380 --> 31:01.180
Can I have one?

31:01.180 --> 31:02.980
Course you can.

32:08.940 --> 32:10.020
DI Renko.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.820
Mishal and Keith, checking in.

32:11.820 --> 32:14.580
Hang on, I've got the guvnor.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.940
Boss, are you going to get
here any time soon?

32:16.940 --> 32:19.220
All right, how are you getting on?
Any updates?

32:19.220 --> 32:20.860
Nope, no movement.

32:20.860 --> 32:24.140
Well, you can stop sulking now. We'll
be there in a bit to relieve you.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.180
Good. Keith's busting for a wee.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.420
Oi!

32:27.420 --> 32:28.700
Well, tell him to hold it in.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.500
What've you got?

33:06.500 --> 33:08.020
The mother lode, bruv.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.460
I'm going to make you well-monied.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.780
I'm already well-monied.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.620
I ain't got time for you
to be a dick. Do you want it or not?

33:15.620 --> 33:17.900
Where shall we meet?

33:17.900 --> 33:19.460
Usual place.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.140
DCI Hicks?

34:03.140 --> 34:04.460
Hello, boss.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.540
What's up?

34:05.540 --> 34:08.139
You need to pull
the surveillance on Ramachandran.

34:08.139 --> 34:10.380
Yeah? Who's saying?

34:10.380 --> 34:14.139
The Lord himself.
I'm just down from the top floor.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.380
Did he say why?

34:15.380 --> 34:16.699
He didn't need to.

34:16.699 --> 34:20.100
He is your Lord and your Master and
you feel it a pleasure to serve him.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.620
Fair enough. Well, we'll be
back at the shop in an hour.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.900
What was all that about?

34:30.020 --> 34:32.780
We have just been told
to withdraw the surveillance.

34:32.780 --> 34:33.820
By who?

34:33.820 --> 34:34.860
Oh, top brass.

34:34.860 --> 34:37.580
Which means top brass will be
getting it from Whitehall.

34:37.580 --> 34:38.699
What, MI5?

34:38.699 --> 34:43.420
Yeah. See, the thing is,
Spooks hate to get embarrassed.

34:43.420 --> 34:46.340
So if Ramachandran's been
rummaging around the government's

34:46.340 --> 34:49.940
underwear drawer, they're going to
want to brush it under the carpet.

34:49.940 --> 34:52.780
They'll write off their victim
as a suicide.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.020
So what do we do?

34:55.659 --> 34:58.260
Well, if our boy's been
going around throwing people

34:58.260 --> 35:00.860
out of 15th-storey windows,
then I want him.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.140
Oh, here we go.

36:47.260 --> 36:48.580
What've you got?

36:52.540 --> 36:53.900
Renko?

36:53.900 --> 36:55.220
Are you there?

36:56.540 --> 36:57.740
Yeah.

37:15.940 --> 37:18.180
Why would you show me this?

37:18.180 --> 37:22.020
I don't know why you would do that.
I've got children!

37:22.020 --> 37:24.180
Renko! Arrgh!

37:25.740 --> 37:29.100
Enough! Police!

37:30.300 --> 37:32.660
That's enough! That's enough!

37:50.700 --> 37:52.540
So what's on here?

37:52.540 --> 37:57.180
Hm? What, some insider information
that you were going to sell to him?

37:57.180 --> 37:59.260
See, the thing is that, no offence,

37:59.260 --> 38:01.860
but I mean you're looking
a bit 1%.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.740
So, if this is just some
insider information,

38:04.740 --> 38:07.340
well, then why have you come over
all strangely? Eh?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.220
Well, I can see that this must be
worth a lot.

38:13.220 --> 38:15.740
Yeah, and for a kid like you,
bit of a dick,

38:15.740 --> 38:18.780
but basically harmless,
to decide it's worth killing for.

38:18.780 --> 38:20.380
What do you mean...

38:20.380 --> 38:22.260
...killing for?

38:22.260 --> 38:23.860
Oh, what? You didn't know?

38:23.860 --> 38:26.020
Oh, mate! Eh?

38:27.420 --> 38:30.540
You are in such shit.

38:37.860 --> 38:40.820
And this Lloyd Hammond?
I thought he was your mate.

38:43.460 --> 38:47.140
He was a character, man,
but I loved him.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.300
All right, so what happened?

38:50.300 --> 38:52.740
He was so excited
that he'd found it.

38:52.740 --> 38:56.140
He was... he was all wired, mental,
he was pacing the floor

38:56.140 --> 38:57.940
back and forth and everything.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.540
He couldn't wait to leak it,

38:59.540 --> 39:01.620
but I didn't think
we should do that.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.580
No, because you wanted to sell it.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.540
Because I wanted to think about it,
yeah.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.780
So we had a ruckus.
Not even a ruckus, really.

39:10.740 --> 39:13.420
He just went over.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.980
Right, seriously, this is doing
my head in.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.140
Don't look at it.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.700
Boss, chain of evidence.

39:25.340 --> 39:28.220
Christ,
how long has this light been red?

39:37.260 --> 39:39.100
Drive! Drive!

39:42.260 --> 39:44.020
MI5?

39:44.020 --> 39:45.620
It's got to be.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.540
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

40:04.460 --> 40:06.380
Come on! Come on!

40:13.460 --> 40:17.020
Come on, come, God,
I've got no signal! Come on!!

40:17.020 --> 40:18.860
Damn it, there's nothing, come on!

40:20.700 --> 40:22.700
Jesus. What is on that flash drive?

40:22.700 --> 40:23.820
Shit!

40:23.820 --> 40:25.660
The engine's flooding.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.340
Keep trying! Keep trying!

40:32.580 --> 40:34.540
Drive! Drive! Drive!

40:43.540 --> 40:45.380
We need to get somewhere public!

40:45.380 --> 40:46.700
Ditch your phone.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.580
I'm not throwing this.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.140
Stop!

40:58.740 --> 41:00.540
Through here, through here.

41:41.220 --> 41:47.060
My name is Charlie Hicks!
I am a police officer!

41:48.660 --> 41:52.780
I am unarmed and I am under attack!

41:52.780 --> 41:54.540
Call the police!

41:54.540 --> 42:00.500
Tell them officers Charlie Hicks
and Elaine Renko are under attack!

42:04.980 --> 42:06.740
Take note of these people!

42:09.100 --> 42:12.660
Photograph them if you can!

42:12.660 --> 42:17.940
Commit their description
to your memory!

42:25.700 --> 42:27.300
You need to hurry! Boss, seriously!

42:27.300 --> 42:28.700
I'm doing it!

43:25.660 --> 43:27.140
What do you think it is?

43:27.140 --> 43:28.660
Don't look.

43:28.660 --> 43:30.060
Yeah, but what is it... Don't!

43:30.060 --> 43:33.100
Come on, what we got to lose?
Don't you need to know?

43:35.420 --> 43:36.860
Cos I do.

43:36.860 --> 43:38.780
I need to know.

44:18.900 --> 44:22.580
That can't be real. It can't be.

44:22.580 --> 44:24.700
It's real enough to kill for.

44:26.540 --> 44:29.020
Yeah, but how long does it say
we've got?

44:30.060 --> 44:31.260
Five years.

44:34.540 --> 44:35.780
Where are you going?

44:35.780 --> 44:37.460
It's MI5, they don't give up.

44:37.460 --> 44:40.940
Look, I need to talk to my wife,

44:40.940 --> 44:42.780
tell her to get somewhere safe.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.380
You should do the same.

45:08.180 --> 45:10.020
Hicks residence.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.860
Charlie?

45:15.420 --> 45:17.420
Charlie, is that you?

45:17.420 --> 45:19.740
Who is this?

45:19.740 --> 45:21.500
Who are you?

45:21.500 --> 45:23.820
I think you know who we are.

45:25.620 --> 45:27.340
Is it true?

45:27.340 --> 45:29.420
What I saw. Is it true?

45:29.420 --> 45:30.820
Look, this is an awful mess.

45:32.460 --> 45:37.100
Last night was...
very badly handled on our part.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.340
But is it true?

45:38.340 --> 45:40.540
But to be fair, you should've pulled
the surveillance

45:40.540 --> 45:43.220
when you were asked to,
so there's blame on both sides.

45:43.220 --> 45:45.460
Is... it... true?!

45:48.260 --> 45:49.780
Yes.

45:51.620 --> 45:54.940
Which is why I'm reaching out
to you, Charlie.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.500
I'm asking you to help me.

46:00.380 --> 46:03.500
Where's Simone? Where's Hailey?

46:05.740 --> 46:08.620
They're safe. For the moment.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.220
And you can keep them that way.

46:12.220 --> 46:14.700
You can keep them safe.

46:14.700 --> 46:17.300
All you have to do is come in.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.500
Come home.

46:21.900 --> 46:23.740
Bring me the flash drive.

46:26.540 --> 46:28.700
We both have daughters, Charlie.

46:30.500 --> 46:33.580
How is knowing about this
going to help them?

46:35.580 --> 46:38.380
How's it going to help anyone?

47:04.180 --> 47:06.140
I need that flash drive.

47:06.140 --> 47:10.060
They, er, they threatened my family,

47:10.060 --> 47:13.260
Elaine, my wife and...

47:14.500 --> 47:16.180
..and my daughter.

47:17.980 --> 47:21.420
So you give them what they ask for
and suddenly your family's safe?

47:21.420 --> 47:23.620
Yeah.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.740
That's not how this plays out.
You know that.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.940
I can make it work.

47:26.940 --> 47:28.540
No, you can't. You don't know me.

47:28.540 --> 47:30.220
You can't game these people!

47:30.220 --> 47:34.220
You're not listening to me, all
right? They threatened my daughter!

47:34.220 --> 47:37.180
And my wife! I mean, Christ,
she's... she's pregnant.

47:37.180 --> 47:40.180
If you do what they want,
we're dead.

47:40.180 --> 47:41.420
So is your wife,

47:41.420 --> 47:43.380
and so is your daughter.

47:43.380 --> 47:45.980
You'd know that,
if you were thinking straight.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.180
They'll be on to your boy next.

47:50.420 --> 47:52.300
What, Daniel, is it?

47:54.300 --> 47:56.580
I mean, how old were you
when you had him?

47:57.700 --> 48:00.740
What, 13? 14?

48:02.300 --> 48:04.060
What was it? Incest?

48:05.860 --> 48:07.340
Rape?

48:10.820 --> 48:11.940
OK. Rape.

48:11.940 --> 48:13.740
You are not listening!

48:13.740 --> 48:16.580
They're going to keep this secret,
no matter what.

48:16.580 --> 48:18.580
Why does he hate you so much?

48:18.580 --> 48:21.420
So all we can do
is stop it being a secret.

48:21.420 --> 48:24.460
Go public. Take it somewhere,
a newspaper or something.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.140
How many times did he stab you?

48:27.900 --> 48:32.220
Christ! What does it take for a boy
to do that to his own mother?

48:32.220 --> 48:34.740
Once that's happened,
their hands are tied.

48:34.740 --> 48:36.900
I mean, they can prosecute us
if they want.

48:36.900 --> 48:38.740
They can send us to prison.

48:38.740 --> 48:42.300
But they cannot kill us to keep a
secret that isn't secret any more!

48:45.140 --> 48:46.740
Give it to me, Elaine.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.140
Look, this is my family.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.340
And I need them to be safe.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.340
No.

49:05.980 --> 49:07.260
Come on, just give it to m...
