00:40.550 --> 00:43.000
Gone to meet his Maker.

00:48.950 --> 00:52.000
Get rid of him.
- Just seeing if he's got a purse.

00:54.570 --> 00:56.770
I'll show you my purse
if you show me yours.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.600
This is an ambush.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.400
You don't say.
- This is how it goes.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.945
There's poor people going hungry.
Tell us what you've got...

01:13.025 --> 01:15.425
be honest with us.
- And we take one tenth...

01:15.550 --> 01:17.900
so the poor can eat.
- Lie...

01:18.020 --> 01:21.000
or resist
- And we take it all.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.570
So what's it gonna be?

01:39.025 --> 01:41.800
Well, what have we got here?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.400
My babies.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.875
Get them.

02:01.450 --> 02:03.450
I don't wanna hurt you
- Oh, sure you was.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.180
I've got the girl.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.175
Time to disappear!

02:14.245 --> 02:17.251
My gang, this way!

02:18.200 --> 02:20.200
The woman you'll find.

02:37.530 --> 02:39.530
Where did they go?

02:40.050 --> 02:42.050
Gone to meet their Makers.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.650
Take me to Nottingham. Idiots.

03:00.550 --> 03:02.350
Come on.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.500
It worked well.
- That was nothing.

03:09.750 --> 03:14.000
Nothing?
Jesus. I love our camp!

NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

04:08.050 --> 04:12.550
Tell me. You would rather
have a woman, Gisborne?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.500
Tell me, you would rather
have a woman...

04:16.700 --> 04:19.500
than all this... power?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.500
We are so close.

04:24.150 --> 04:26.150
Indeed.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.100
Talking of our lady...

04:29.170 --> 04:33.170
it's time to go get
the pretty one and her daddy.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.700
Edward and Marian.

04:37.271 --> 04:40.350
If they resist, shall I use force?

04:42.050 --> 04:44.050
Get them to speak, Gisborne.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.400
Use force anyway.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.500
How're we doing, Allan?
- Could have been nasty.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.820
OUTLAW'S CAMP

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Those men were well trained.
- Woman wasn't bad.

05:01.450 --> 05:05.000
Nearly had you for a minute there?
- No. I doubt that.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.350
What's that?
- Boss-lady's ring.

05:12.150 --> 05:14.150
I know it.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.250
That's the Sheriff's insignia.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.550
So what?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.750
What, we robbed
a friend of the Sheriff.

05:21.850 --> 05:25.200
It is more than a friend
if she shares the Sheriff's insignia.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.450
Ah, the glamorous one.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
The successful one.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.950
So... so, how was your journey?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.650
I ran into an old friend of yours.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.850
Hood.

05:58.050 --> 06:01.100
He didn't hurt your babies?
- No.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.900
But I do want him caught.
- Don't worry.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.250
Everything is in place.
Tomorrow, when our friends gather...

06:08.320 --> 06:10.500
they gather to watch him die.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.550
The plan is?
- The whole garrison, 400 men.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.300
Men is good...

06:20.301 --> 06:23.400
But a woman... is better.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.470
KNIGHTON HALL

06:37.500 --> 06:41.250
And that's all I'm taking off
until you go away.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.251
You are spoil sport, Marian.

06:49.150 --> 06:51.152
What do you make of this?

06:51.900 --> 06:53.900
The Sheriff's insignia.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.500
We took it off a woman
on her way to Nottingham today.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.080
And she had men,
and they were well trained.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
It was like a military unit.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.450
And she's been granted
the Sheriff's insignia.

07:04.530 --> 07:06.850
And what does that mean?
- I don't know.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.150
I was hoping you or
your father might know.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.100
I get the feeling we're not too
welcome in the corridors of power.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.000
Good.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.300
Come and join my gang.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.750
In your dreams.
- Wait.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.800
Listen.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.950
Did you hear it?
- What?

07:33.100 --> 07:36.180
That kiss spoke volumes.
- Did it?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.300
What did it say?

07:40.450 --> 07:42.450
It said...

07:42.580 --> 07:45.651
"Marian wants to come
and join your gang."

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
Really?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.720
That's not what I heard.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.250
What I heard was
a little voice saying...

07:54.750 --> 07:57.550
"Abandon your home,
abandon your father...

07:57.900 --> 08:00.200
give up any hope
of a normal life and...

08:00.600 --> 08:02.600
take up arms with a man who thinks...

08:02.670 --> 08:04.900
resistance is about
showing off with the bow."

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
That's not fair.
- And to do what?

08:07.350 --> 08:11.801
To wait for a king, who lets face it,
may or may not make it home.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.200
What?

08:15.270 --> 08:17.770
See, I've been thinking about it then.

08:30.650 --> 08:34.650
Sir Edward, Marian!
Out, now!

08:38.169 --> 08:39.799
Sir Guy!

08:39.900 --> 08:41.900
Halt there!
- I'm gonna kill him.

08:41.970 --> 08:44.100
You shoot first, think later.
- I will not allow this.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.170
Do you want my father killed?
- Marian!

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
Who'll give you respect,
when you do nothing?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.400
Come down now or
I'll torch your house!

08:50.850 --> 08:55.150
Do you respect me?
- Don't keep me waiting!

08:55.900 --> 08:57.900
I respect you.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.620
Father!
- You come when I say!

09:00.800 --> 09:02.800
I'm unhurt.
- What do you want?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.980
You're coming to the castle. Sheriff
wants you, where he can see you.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.100
No, we're not!
My father is frail, release him!

09:07.200 --> 09:09.800
You do not tell me what to do!

09:10.400 --> 09:12.900
Burn the house.
- Guy, no.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.900
Please, sir Guy.
- Better.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.700
Sir Guy?

09:22.650 --> 09:24.650
Beg!

09:27.700 --> 09:31.250
Sir Guy. Please, I beg you...

09:32.050 --> 09:34.050
Much better.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.200
But still not good enough.

09:40.270 --> 09:42.070
No!

09:54.550 --> 09:57.000
Come on! To the castle, move it!

09:58.200 --> 10:00.500
Come on, you did it to us!
Do something!

10:04.350 --> 10:06.350
Move out!

10:17.300 --> 10:20.130
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

10:25.600 --> 10:28.600
Something's up.
That is proper lockdown.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.100
Can't just be freight with Marian.

10:42.650 --> 10:45.150
Now, who is that?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.700
Why not just knock on
the door and ask the Sheriff?

10:53.350 --> 10:56.500
We're not gonna find that much standing
around here all morning, are we?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
What do you recommend?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.150
Since you ask,
I was gonna go to the tavern...

11:04.151 --> 11:06.151
Some new tricks I wanna try,
here look at this...

11:06.152 --> 11:09.100
Three cups, right?
- Come on.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.350
No, no, come on.
Robin, this is lovely. Honest.

11:11.550 --> 11:14.150
Since when have we been
tavern tricksters, Allan?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.100
Didn't it get all funny about Marian,
why did you let Gisborne...

11:17.170 --> 11:19.470
grab her in the first place?
- Be careful.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.800
The sanctimonious old fart...

11:30.100 --> 11:32.100
and her father.

11:33.550 --> 11:36.802
I gather you've been callous
with the wood fire.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.203
You know full well that is not the case.
- Tell me...

11:41.300 --> 11:44.400
Who's side are you on?
Mine or King Richard's?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.050
The real world or the old world?

11:50.070 --> 11:52.070
Yours.

11:53.900 --> 11:59.350
Come along. We both know
that's not true, do we?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.550
I believe in justice. I believe
in the rights of the free men.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.400
Who cares what you believe in?

12:08.150 --> 12:12.350
I have a plan...
and I will not tolerate descent.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.700
So...

12:16.800 --> 12:20.250
You are under house arrest,
here in the castle.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.400
Until I can find some use for you.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.901
My Lord Sheriff, I must protest.
- You must?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.370
My father is unwell.
He must be allowed to stay...

12:27.450 --> 12:29.450
One more word out of you missy...

12:29.520 --> 12:32.000
and your father
will never be unwell again.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.900
My Lord. Another one of
our friends has arrived.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.950
Good.

12:38.150 --> 12:39.950
Guy!

12:42.600 --> 12:44.400
Please.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.950
The castle is
no place for an old man.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.650
You think you can humiliate
a man at the altar?

12:51.850 --> 12:56.500
A man like me, and get away with it?
You're wrong.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.600
Marian's in there.
- Yeah, she's probably having...

13:03.670 --> 13:06.300
cakes and ale with the Sheriff.
- You just don't get it, do you?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.301
No. I don't get anything.
That's what I'm saying.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.000
You know, we risk our lives to get
money, then we give all of it away.

13:12.070 --> 13:15.000
What's that about? I'm not being
funny. We should get something.

13:15.070 --> 13:17.070
If we don't get anything
we're gonna get weak...

13:17.140 --> 13:19.140
get demoralized. Then how
are we gonna help the poor?

13:19.210 --> 13:22.200
You're not weak.
- No, but I might get weak.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.070
Anyway, it doesn't matter to you.
- Why?

13:25.150 --> 13:27.150
You've always been weak.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
Very funny.

13:32.150 --> 13:34.150
You know, why don't you just...?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.720
Just!
- Why don't I just what?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.050
Why don't you just jigger off?
- Jigger off?

13:40.200 --> 13:42.300
You what?
What does that mean, jigger?

13:42.450 --> 13:45.500
You know what it means.
- What?

13:48.950 --> 13:51.400
What? Where are you going?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.800
Master?
- Just let him go.

13:54.950 --> 13:56.950
He needs to cool off.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.251
We've forgotten about the poor today.
We said we'd be here to hand down.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.252
The Sheriff's not
forgotten about them.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.900
Look at that... folk woman.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.700
Caught her to that old pile and
try to humiliate one of them.

14:12.070 --> 14:14.701
For now, we'll try the west gate.
Come on.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.700
All right.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.703
Just that your wages?
- What's it to you?

14:34.704 --> 14:37.800
I thought you might fancy
doubling your money.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.200
There's another one.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
I know that man.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
Foster of Rotheram.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.000
Who is he?
- He's a schemer.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.000
And he's nasty and
he's an enemy of the King.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.400
The day Foster and the Sheriff get
together is a blood day for England.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.901
And if all those visitors
are the same, then...

15:07.500 --> 15:09.600
Go back to the camp and
tell the others to get ready.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.770
And tell them the castle is
locked down. And tell Will...

15:11.850 --> 15:13.850
to think of a way
to get over that wall.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.100
Where are you going?

15:17.101 --> 15:19.501
What if we get in,
we'll need uniforms.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.000
Why do you offence?
- I need your uniform.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.500
I'm not being funny.
Cost me money every time.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.700
Oh! Shame, shame.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.250
Thank you very much.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.100
Oh! Unlucky, unlucky.
Another go? Have another go!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.880
Unlucky.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Felt you but might.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
Gotcha.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
This is the Sheriff's work?

16:19.100 --> 16:21.100
Just go away.

16:22.101 --> 16:24.800
Look, I don't want any sympathy
and I don' want any monkey food...

16:24.870 --> 16:27.670
thrown at me. So, unless
you've got a better idea, go away.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.450
Ma'am. How about I rescue you?
- No, thanks.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm Robin Hood.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.500
Really?

16:37.950 --> 16:41.450
No, thanks. I'm taking
a punishment for my children.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.700
They were caught stealing
scraps from the castle kitchens.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.701
Go on, shoo.

16:47.950 --> 16:49.950
I've got to stay or they get it.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.300
It's just for a day.
So do me a favor and get lost.

16:53.370 --> 16:55.370
If you and your children
need extra food...

16:55.440 --> 16:57.440
my men and I can help.
Every few days...

16:57.730 --> 16:59.930
we bring those who need
a little food or money.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
I can add you to our list.

17:02.450 --> 17:04.650
If you give me your name.
- What? You think...

17:04.720 --> 17:07.420
because you've given me a coin
I'm gonna tell you my name?

17:09.800 --> 17:11.800
I have to go. You don't have
to give me your name.

17:12.001 --> 17:14.201
Just be on the market on Thursdays.
My men'll find you.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.200
Hey!

17:20.250 --> 17:22.050
Rose.

17:22.230 --> 17:24.230
My name is Rose.

17:26.450 --> 17:28.450
Thank you.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.850
Excellent, my tiny tricksters.

17:36.950 --> 17:39.350
Now, where's Gisborne?

17:39.950 --> 17:42.550
Tell Gisborne it's showtime.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.450
Good. Very good.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.100
What?

17:49.350 --> 17:51.350
What do you want?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.700
So, tell me...

18:02.850 --> 18:05.850
Where are your friends?
- What are you talking about?

18:07.100 --> 18:09.100
Oh, not this again.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.700
You think I'm one of
Robin Hood's men, don't ya?

18:12.100 --> 18:14.400
One who looks like me,
what's his name?

18:14.600 --> 18:17.750
Allan, right?
No, no. My name's Tom.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.900
Tom.

18:23.850 --> 18:25.901
Don't insult me.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.602
What's happened?
Robin Hood kick you out?

18:34.180 --> 18:37.820
Tricky working within taverns doesn't
sound very Robin Hood to me.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.900
I told you, I don't know Robin Hood.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.801
Show me some respect and maybe
we can talk about a deal.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.000
Sir Guy.
Sheriff says it's showtime.

18:52.550 --> 18:54.550
Torture him.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.100
Hang on! I admit, all right?
I'm Allan-a-Dale.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Too late.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.350
Come on, a deal? You said a deal!

19:05.420 --> 19:07.420
Too late. No need anymore.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.500
People.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.750
My dear people.

19:34.700 --> 19:38.450
There two young scallywags here
think because they are children...

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
They can escape justice.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.200
They have committed a crime.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.601
One of my men saw fit...

19:49.180 --> 19:51.550
to take pity on them
and their mother...

19:51.720 --> 19:54.500
and allowed her to take
a punishment for them.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.150
Very generous but misguided.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.650
They must lose a hand.

20:02.850 --> 20:04.850
<i>No.</i>

20:05.200 --> 20:07.200
It is the law.
- No.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.700
No! My children, no!

20:11.100 --> 20:14.050
Motherly compassion.
The sweet charming.

20:14.350 --> 20:16.350
Bring out the equipment.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.550
Please, they didn't...
they meant no harm.

20:19.100 --> 20:23.000
Please, don't take their hands.
- Shut up!

20:25.700 --> 20:27.700
Come along. Chop, chop.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.080
I, Vaizey...

20:34.500 --> 20:37.350
Sheriff of Nottingham, hereby
pronounce sentence of...

20:37.600 --> 20:41.250
Little Tiny Billy and Tiny Little Jay
blah-di-blah-di-blah...

20:41.550 --> 20:43.550
Chop off their hands.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.900
Somebody save my children!

20:51.480 --> 20:54.400
Touch those children and there's
an arrow here for you, Sheriff!

20:54.470 --> 20:56.470
Do it.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
Rose! Children!

21:01.472 --> 21:04.272
Run!
- They can't! Help!

21:04.420 --> 21:06.420
No, Robin. Don't go down.

21:16.950 --> 21:18.950
The locks, quickly!

21:19.850 --> 21:21.650
Now!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.800
Clever.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.900
Very, very clever.
- Put down your weapon, Hood.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.400
So... tell me.

21:52.300 --> 21:55.201
Are these even your children?
- Children?

21:58.280 --> 22:00.080
No.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.100
You show me your face...

22:04.700 --> 22:06.700
and I'll show you mine.

22:20.150 --> 22:23.301
Did I tell you I had a sister, Hood?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
My friends.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.400
Our time has come.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.500
King Richard is marching on Jerusalem.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.350
By the time the year is out
he will be home.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.900
So...

22:53.050 --> 22:57.100
Operation "Shah mat" must
move to the next phase.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.050
Mobilize your men.
Bring me your bids for funding.

23:02.150 --> 23:04.150
We must be ready.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.830
Wherever King Richard
lands on English soil...

23:07.950 --> 23:11.600
we must be there to greet him,
to embrace him.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.601
Oh, our king is dead.

23:17.850 --> 23:19.850
Long live the King.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.000
So, meanwhile...
today's entertainment.

23:25.950 --> 23:29.600
My friends. Allow me to introduce...

23:31.200 --> 23:33.901
From high lord, to low criminal.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.602
From noble, to nothing.

23:36.830 --> 23:38.930
From rank, to skank.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.604
From hero, to zero.

23:44.450 --> 23:46.450
Robin Hood.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.551
Welcome to my new chamber, Hood.

23:49.670 --> 23:51.670
We are the Black Knights.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.400
Why so coy, Vaizey?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.900
Why not call yourselves the traitors?

23:57.170 --> 24:01.800
An operation "Shah mat"?
Why not call it "Checkmate"?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.800
Or better still, "Kill the King"?
- Very good. He knows his Persian.

24:05.850 --> 24:09.220
Very clever.
- The taxes. The money you've raised.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.200
What did you think? Did you think
I was gonna buy myself a new rug?

24:12.550 --> 24:15.000
You don't know me at all, Hood.

24:15.350 --> 24:17.550
Myself and my friends,
we have no interest in money.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.650
It's for an army of mercenaries.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.800
We want power.

24:21.870 --> 24:24.070
Between us we will
run the new England.

24:24.180 --> 24:27.100
We are the new England.
- Well then God help us.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.800
Yes, what God is he when
he can't help you now. Shame.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.700
Because I really rather
enjoyed thy little skirmishes.

24:35.450 --> 24:37.450
Davida.

24:52.070 --> 24:54.070
My babies.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500
Death by fang.

25:09.220 --> 25:12.500
Listen, this can make it so...
- Surely.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.750
How about little pay?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.250
You're paid man,
how about a little wager?

25:29.300 --> 25:31.300
That's no, by the way.

25:37.950 --> 25:39.950
Inch by inch, Hood...

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
you'll be lowered to your death.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.150
My friend sir Guy would like
to ask you a question...

25:53.220 --> 25:55.220
before we say good bye.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.900
Tell me, Hood.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.100
Who is the Nightwatchman?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.800
I don't know, Gisborne.

26:07.670 --> 26:10.800
But I do know I'll kiss him when
I see him, for stealing from you.

26:11.950 --> 26:14.150
And for showing, it's not just me.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.900
You see, there are people like me...

26:18.150 --> 26:20.650
and the Nightwatchman,
all over England...

26:21.600 --> 26:23.951
who will stand up for justice.

26:27.220 --> 26:31.000
<i>Look here. An enlightenment
player through the wood.</i>

26:31.300 --> 26:33.300
For what?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.320
So you could be King of the paupers?

26:39.100 --> 26:41.121
Do you think they'd love you?

26:41.230 --> 26:43.230
Did you think they'd
kneel to your name?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
Trust me.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.550
You're not dead yet,
they forgot you already.

27:08.350 --> 27:10.550
The Nightwatchman.
- What?

27:29.850 --> 27:31.950
The Nightwatchman! Get after him!

27:32.100 --> 27:35.500
A double execution! Very good.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.170
My friends. I suggest
you retire to your quarters...

27:53.250 --> 27:55.250
and we reconvene tonight.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
Thank you.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.500
So, handsome.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.700
I almost regret tricking you now.

28:15.220 --> 28:18.000
A clue, no.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.920
Remember this, Nightwatchman?

28:43.750 --> 28:46.050
Take off your mask.
I wanna see your face when you die.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.800
Mistake, my friend. You should
have run when you had the chance.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.900
Get up, you idiots!

29:09.400 --> 29:11.200
Gisborne!

29:11.580 --> 29:14.401
Get him!
- Don't worry. He's mine.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.900
What's the matter?
Does nobody love you?

29:20.180 --> 29:22.180
That's your real weakness, isn't it?

29:22.780 --> 29:25.150
You need people to love you.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.250
It's better than needing
reptiles to love you.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.931
My brother loves me.
- Like I said.

29:39.300 --> 29:42.650
Looks like you're gonna die
without an audience, Hood.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.080
Think, think!

30:33.700 --> 30:35.700
What's he doing?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
Why's he running away?

30:39.350 --> 30:41.550
He's creating a distraction!

31:11.250 --> 31:13.400
You're wasting your time, my friend!

31:13.600 --> 31:16.700
Robin Hood is already dead!

32:16.080 --> 32:17.880
Yes.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.120
Impressive.

32:31.500 --> 32:35.100
What were you thinking
you would do, if you did escape?

32:35.650 --> 32:39.500
Between us, we have 10 000 men.

32:40.450 --> 32:42.501
What was your plan?

32:42.750 --> 32:46.250
Were you going to save England,
single-handed?

32:46.380 --> 32:50.000
Not single-handed.
There's five or six of us.

32:59.950 --> 33:01.750
Help.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.410
Help.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.950
Get me out!

33:10.340 --> 33:12.340
Get me out!

33:18.950 --> 33:20.750
Help! Get me out!

33:21.580 --> 33:23.380
Davida?
- Brother?

33:23.450 --> 33:25.550
What have you done? Would you get
my sister out of there, right now!

33:25.620 --> 33:27.700
Don't make any sudden...

33:29.400 --> 33:31.000
movements.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.401
Get her out. Get her out!

33:44.020 --> 33:46.650
There must be a cure.
Some medicine, yes?

33:46.900 --> 33:49.000
No.
- Sheriff?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.100
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you now...

33:53.170 --> 33:55.970
and put an end to your treason?
- Shut up, Hood.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
Then you die with your sister.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.150
You haven't told him, have you?

34:01.770 --> 34:04.370
Prince John has made
the Sheriff a promise.

34:04.870 --> 34:09.500
If my brother should die
an unnatural death...

34:10.400 --> 34:15.300
then the county of Nottingham and
everything in it shall be obliterated.

34:15.699 --> 34:19.650
Every town and village will be burned.

34:20.380 --> 34:23.699
Every man, every woman...

34:24.250 --> 34:29.000
and every innocent
little child, hanged.

34:31.100 --> 34:34.800
Would you lay all that
on your conscience...

34:35.199 --> 34:37.199
pretty boy?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
So long.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.929
Don't die.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.250
You're strong.
You're my strong sister.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.750
I'm not strong.

34:59.550 --> 35:01.551
I was being you...

35:02.350 --> 35:04.552
so you'd notice me.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.753
So you'd...

35:06.870 --> 35:08.870
love me.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.960
I love you.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.756
I've always loved you.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.950
I want him dead.

35:31.440 --> 35:36.000
Gisborne, whatever it takes,
I want him... dead.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.800
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

35:58.650 --> 36:01.450
Robin?
- Who died?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.520
You did.
The Sheriff said you were dead.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.450
The Sheriff.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.520
The Sheriff
has plotted to kill the King.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
With his friends, the Black knights.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.100
They're already dividing
England between themselves.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.800
You can't go back into the castle.
- We must get word to the King.

36:14.870 --> 36:17.370
Nottingham is not safe.
- It's not just Nottingham.

36:17.830 --> 36:20.750
Black knights.
The Black knights, they're everywhere.

36:20.820 --> 36:23.250
They're taxing the poor unto
pay for an army of mercenaries.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.880
Wouldn't we stop them?
I must go back to the castle.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.960
It's too dangerous.

36:28.030 --> 36:30.770
Having a spy on the inside when
there's a coup being plotted is useful.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.400
No. For once, just listen to me.
- And my father is in there.

36:33.470 --> 36:35.730
Robin, I have to go back.
- Marian...

36:35.950 --> 36:38.130
I can't protect you in the castle.
- Two minutes ago...

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
I thought you were dead and
I would have given anything...

36:40.270 --> 36:43.430
for another chance to be with you.
- Well then take that chance.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.680
And come with me.

36:46.230 --> 36:49.300
Listen.
- What?

36:53.530 --> 36:55.730
Little voice, saying yes.

36:56.150 --> 36:58.531
When the King is home, safe.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.632
Hood. You have failed saying goodbye.

37:16.850 --> 37:18.850
Take aim.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.623
What?

37:22.770 --> 37:24.770
No more public humiliation, Gisborne?

37:26.130 --> 37:28.150
No more beating and parading?
- The Sheriff doesn't wanna...

37:28.220 --> 37:30.970
say goodbye either.
He just wants you dead now.

37:35.950 --> 37:38.471
See you on the dark side.
Shoot him!

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
So it is good night from me.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.101
And good night from me.

37:52.950 --> 37:54.750
Guards!

37:54.820 --> 37:56.620
What!

37:56.700 --> 37:58.700
Pepper. Ouch!

37:58.790 --> 38:02.650
You see, Gisborne?
That's why I didn't say goodbye.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.100
Because I did wanna see you cry.

38:09.100 --> 38:11.430
Time to disappear?
- Yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.200
My gang. This way, come on.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.530
We're having fun.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.300
Hood was, did you know...

38:32.200 --> 38:34.200
Didn't try and rescue you.

38:35.350 --> 38:37.350
So, I was thinking...

38:38.450 --> 38:42.000
One chance to live.
- I will not help you kill Robin.

38:43.370 --> 38:46.450
M'not helping you kill anyone.
- Yeah, I respect you for that.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.451
So lets look at this
another way, shall we?

38:51.700 --> 38:54.700
An exchange. As we go along.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.680
Little information, a little money...

38:58.650 --> 39:00.650
a conversation.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
What sort of conversation?
- Oh, harmless one.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.500
If I need extra guards
in a building, you let me know.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.401
If I need to reroute a convoy.

39:12.402 --> 39:14.402
That sort of conversation.

39:15.950 --> 39:17.950
I am not robbed.

39:18.310 --> 39:20.310
Robin is not killed.

39:20.830 --> 39:22.830
In between us pulls a service.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
You and I.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.900
We are the ones, who make our
supposed betters look good.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.520
And they take us for granted.

39:38.950 --> 39:40.950
But what happens when they move on?

39:41.750 --> 39:43.750
Then it's our turn.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.751
You wanna help the poor?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.400
Help yourself first.

39:52.350 --> 39:54.401
Make provision for the future.

39:56.300 --> 40:00.000
You'll never be named,
you'll never be implicated.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.400
This is just between you and me.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.800
You'll be my eyes and my ears.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.830
And when all this is over...

40:12.330 --> 40:14.830
You will have money and position.

40:15.730 --> 40:18.030
And you can help the poor
they hearts content.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.800
It's not the end of the world, is it?

40:32.410 --> 40:35.110
I mean Marian's all right,
basically and...

40:35.930 --> 40:37.930
We've got a camp.
- Much.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.400
The Sheriff and the Black knights
are gonna kill the King.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.830
Take over England.
- Huh, true.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.040
It is the end of the world.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.070
But if we have learned one thing
today it's that you're never going...

40:50.150 --> 40:52.150
to Nottingham alone again, ever.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.900
Because if you had died,
especially now...

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
If I had died...

40:57.540 --> 40:59.540
today, Much.

40:59.740 --> 41:03.140
Or if I die tomorrow,
you'll carry on without me.

41:03.650 --> 41:08.400
How? We are Robin Hood's men.
- No. You are Robin Hood.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
What?
- You're all Robin Hood.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.000
And you are, and you are.
All of you.

41:15.450 --> 41:18.250
We're not that, are we?
- Listen to me. Listen.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.740
We are not just six
outlaws in the forest.

41:22.600 --> 41:26.000
We are the spirit of England
and that is Robin Hood.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.600
And that lads, that...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.620
is this country's only hope.

41:33.800 --> 41:37.200
We are Robin Hood. Come on.

41:38.070 --> 41:40.070
Hi, old lads.

41:40.071 --> 41:42.071
What happened to you?

41:42.072 --> 41:44.872
Trick one panacea me.
- Or I could have told you.

41:46.780 --> 41:50.000
We are Robin Hood.
- What?

41:50.230 --> 41:52.230
Just say it.

41:53.750 --> 41:56.650
We are Robin Hood!

42:03.000 --> 42:04.550
<i>NEXT TIME</i>

42:04.650 --> 42:06.650
<i>They are expecting a visitor today.
He's a gambler.</i>

42:07.600 --> 42:10.500
<i>We will extend the count
every courtesy and then...</i>

42:10.560 --> 42:12.561
<i>we shall take every penny he's got</i>

42:14.200 --> 42:16.200
<i>Stop.
- How did Robin Hood...</i>

42:16.270 --> 42:19.150
<i>find out about the Strong Room?
- Robin, please be careful.</i>

42:19.230 --> 42:21.230
<i>England needs me.
- England needs us.</i>

42:21.300 --> 42:23.300
<i>And I need you.</i>

42:25.600 --> 42:28.000
<i>Men are so obvious.
- Much, don't touch that!</i>
