WEBVTT

00:03.032 --> 00:05.686
So, Bernadette, how goes
the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

00:05.687 --> 00:07.253
Well, if you don't mind
looking like

00:07.255 --> 00:09.055
an orange traffic cone, great.

00:09.057 --> 00:11.808
AMY: Girlfriends,
I have the answer

00:11.810 --> 00:12.976
to our dress problems.

00:12.978 --> 00:14.027
BERNADETTE:
Really?

00:14.029 --> 00:16.145
AMY: 12 years ago,
my cousin Irene

00:16.146 --> 00:17.263
and her entire family died

00:17.265 --> 00:19.265
in a horrific
carbon monoxide accident

00:19.267 --> 00:21.317
the night before her wedding.

00:22.486 --> 00:23.953
That's horrible.

00:23.955 --> 00:25.738
Yes and no.

00:26.824 --> 00:28.791
All those bridesmaids dresses
remain unused

00:28.793 --> 00:30.994
and available to us for free.

00:30.996 --> 00:32.996
So it seems

00:32.998 --> 00:34.797
that cloud of
odorless deadly gas

00:34.799 --> 00:36.582
had a silver lining after all.

00:36.584 --> 00:38.084
Check it out,

00:38.086 --> 00:39.118
still in the bags.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.087
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

00:43.757 --> 00:45.058
I don't know.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.726
Dead people's dresses?

00:46.728 --> 00:48.761
Yeah, and
cap sleeve

00:48.763 --> 00:50.513
Eh...

00:50.515 --> 00:52.798
Oh, I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.934
Irene was always
a slave to a good bargain

00:54.936 --> 00:56.135
when it came to clothes,

00:56.137 --> 00:58.404
and sadly as it turned out,
space heaters.

00:59.606 --> 01:01.190
Ladies, please.

01:01.192 --> 01:05.695
These four walls once housed
an intellectual salon

01:05.697 --> 01:07.813
where the mind
received nourishment

01:07.815 --> 01:09.365
as well as the stomach.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.318
But through no one's fault,
Penny,

01:12.320 --> 01:15.371
the quality of
dinner conversation

01:15.373 --> 01:17.490
in this apartment
has declined.

01:17.492 --> 01:21.511
And again, I'm looking at
no one in particular, Penny.

01:22.763 --> 01:23.963
Fine.

01:23.965 --> 01:25.515
What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?

01:25.517 --> 01:27.967
"What would you like
to talk about, Sheldon?"

01:27.969 --> 01:30.136
Why do you hate us?

01:31.438 --> 01:32.671
I've prepared a number of topics

01:32.673 --> 01:34.223
that should appeal
to both the advanced

01:34.225 --> 01:36.893
and novice
conversationalists.

01:36.895 --> 01:38.945
Okay, that time
you looked at me.

01:39.863 --> 01:40.947
Who didn't?

01:40.949 --> 01:42.365
Your skin is
like alabaster.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.701
Do you even
have pores?

01:45.502 --> 01:47.286
SHELDON:
Topic one:

01:47.288 --> 01:49.789
"Faster-than-light particles
at CERN--

01:49.791 --> 01:51.724
"paradigm-shifting discovery

01:51.726 --> 01:55.078
or another Swiss export as
full of holes as their cheese?"

01:55.080 --> 01:56.462
And converse.

01:57.548 --> 01:59.265
PENNY:
All right, who wants to go

01:59.267 --> 02:00.666
to my apartment and look at
bridal magazines?

02:00.668 --> 02:01.968
Oh, me.

02:01.970 --> 02:04.804
Through no one's fault, Sheldon,
we're leaving.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.473
Wait for <i>moi.</i>

02:08.476 --> 02:10.393
You're leaving?

02:10.395 --> 02:13.179
Sheldon, sometimes you forget,
I'm a lady.

02:13.181 --> 02:14.313
And with that comes

02:14.315 --> 02:15.898
an estrogen-fueled need
to page through

02:15.900 --> 02:18.317
thick glossy magazines
that make me hate my body.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.408
New topic: women.

02:25.410 --> 02:29.445
Delightfully mysterious
or bat-crap crazy?

02:29.447 --> 02:30.446
Totally.

02:30.448 --> 02:31.897
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

02:31.899 --> 02:34.534
If you have the right figure
for it, they're adorable.

03:04.730 --> 03:07.335
Hey, Amy, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

03:07.336 --> 03:10.170
Your neurology department
loaned me a culture of prions

03:10.172 --> 03:12.956
for my research on bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.

03:16.728 --> 03:20.814
She popped by to borrow
a cup of mad cow disease.

03:22.684 --> 03:25.235
It's hard to make degenerative
brain maladies hilarious,

03:25.237 --> 03:27.071
and yet somehow you do it.

03:28.823 --> 03:31.025
That's fun to have
in a lunchroom.

03:31.027 --> 03:33.243
The real fun starts
when you get to pick the rat

03:33.245 --> 03:35.312
you're going to feed it to,
and maybe you choose

03:35.314 --> 03:38.165
the beady-eyed little mother
who's been biting you all week.

03:38.167 --> 03:40.951
Please, we're eating.

03:40.953 --> 03:42.586
Can we get that
off the table

03:42.588 --> 03:43.587
and change the subject?

03:43.589 --> 03:44.538
Can we?

03:44.540 --> 03:46.373
Stand back...

03:46.375 --> 03:51.011
while I turn this conversation
into a "conver-sensation."

03:51.013 --> 03:53.130
This time, it's your fault.

03:54.265 --> 03:56.684
I have 100
alphabetized topics from

03:56.686 --> 03:59.720
"artichoke-- come on, people,
it's just a giant thistle,"

03:59.722 --> 04:05.025
to "zzz-- the onamona-poetry
of sleep."

04:05.027 --> 04:07.010
Amy, how long
would it take

04:07.012 --> 04:10.030
for that mad cow disease
to kill me?

04:10.032 --> 04:12.066
I don't know,
four or five years.

04:13.568 --> 04:15.852
No, it's not gonna do it.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.875
Oy. Bernadette keeps
texting me pictures

04:21.877 --> 04:24.461
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

04:24.463 --> 04:26.080
They're out shopping right now?

04:26.082 --> 04:27.047
Yeah.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.248
Just the two of them?

04:28.250 --> 04:29.866
I guess.

04:30.702 --> 04:34.171
That's cool, that's cool.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.090
Why are they asking me
about this stuff?

04:36.092 --> 04:39.560
What guy knows
what a sweetheart neckline is?

04:46.067 --> 04:48.318
(video game music
playing over TV)

04:51.055 --> 04:54.408
Leonard's coming down
the home stretch!

04:56.945 --> 04:59.163
Come on, horsey,
you can do this!

05:01.065 --> 05:04.451
Damn. Come on, thigh muscles,
you can do this!

05:04.453 --> 05:05.702
(panting)

05:05.704 --> 05:07.921
Yes! First place.

05:07.923 --> 05:12.009
I would have been a great jockey
if I weren't too tall.

05:13.628 --> 05:16.013
And scared of horses.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.264
Sheldon, you're up.

05:17.266 --> 05:18.766
What?

05:18.768 --> 05:19.933
Come on, it's your turn.

05:19.935 --> 05:22.469
We said we'd get more fresh air.

05:22.471 --> 05:24.054
Sorry.

05:24.056 --> 05:25.389
I'm a little distracted.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.558
I can't seem
to get in touch with Amy.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.426
I tried e-mail, video chat,

05:29.428 --> 05:30.927
tweeting her,
posting on

05:30.929 --> 05:33.397
her Facebook wall,
texting her, nothing.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.365
Did you try calling her
on the telephone?

05:36.201 --> 05:38.285
The telephone.

05:41.606 --> 05:44.408
You know, Leonard,
in your own simple way,

05:44.410 --> 05:47.110
you may be the wisest of us all.

05:47.929 --> 05:49.296
Voice mail.

05:49.298 --> 05:53.050
Curiouser and curiouser.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.718
If you're worried,
we can go over there

05:54.720 --> 05:55.952
and see if she's all right.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.120
Okay.

05:57.122 --> 05:58.589
You know, I heard
in the news

05:58.591 --> 06:02.559
a bobcat has been spotted
in her neighborhood.

06:02.561 --> 06:05.429
I don't think
Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.315
Who thinks Amy was
eaten by a bobcat?

06:09.184 --> 06:10.767
You do?

06:10.769 --> 06:14.771
Leonard, I was just mentioning
an interesting local news item.

06:14.773 --> 06:17.991
Now, thanks to you, I'm worried
Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

06:17.993 --> 06:20.077
Forget about the bobcat.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.830
How can I?
You won't stop talking about it!

06:50.109 --> 06:51.558
Uh...

06:51.560 --> 06:52.860
She's your friend.

06:52.862 --> 06:54.228
Step up.

06:55.613 --> 06:58.181
Amy. Amy. Amy.

06:58.183 --> 06:59.700
Bye.

06:59.702 --> 07:00.817
Where are you going?

07:00.819 --> 07:03.620
I'm single, I don't
need this crap.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.190
Sheldon, what are you
doing here?

07:07.192 --> 07:08.325
You didn't respond to

07:08.327 --> 07:10.294
any of my electronic
communications.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.079
I wanted to be alone.

07:14.883 --> 07:16.667
Would you like to talk about it?

07:16.669 --> 07:21.805
And keep in mind that "no"
is a perfectly viable answer.

07:21.807 --> 07:25.142
Sheldon, my world is
crumbling around me.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.377
Point of order.

07:27.379 --> 07:30.380
As you're in distress,
it would be customary

07:30.382 --> 07:32.599
for me to offer you
a hot beverage.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.652
But I'm a guest in your home,

07:35.654 --> 07:39.156
so it would be customary for you
to offer me a beverage.

07:40.391 --> 07:44.077
How do you want to proceed
vis-à-vis beverages?

07:44.079 --> 07:45.245
It doesn't matter.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.614
Nothing matters.

07:48.917 --> 07:52.920
If you'd like to take your mind
off what's troubling you,

07:52.922 --> 07:57.291
uh, word on the street is
a bobcat has been spotted.

07:58.126 --> 08:00.076
Penny and Bernadette
went shopping

08:00.078 --> 08:01.911
for bridesmaids dresses
without me.

08:01.913 --> 08:07.584
And that made
you feel... sad?

08:07.586 --> 08:09.186
Yes.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.938
I knew it.

08:11.856 --> 08:12.889
Just keep going.

08:12.891 --> 08:14.975
I guess I'm
good at this.

08:16.644 --> 08:18.979
It's just, I thought
they liked hanging out with me,

08:18.981 --> 08:21.365
but I guess I was
fooling myself.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.117
When they were
over here,

08:24.119 --> 08:27.937
did you fail to offer
them a beverage?

08:29.207 --> 08:32.876
'Cause I can see how that
could stick in someone's craw.

08:32.878 --> 08:36.046
Sheldon, I'm going
to ask you something,

08:36.048 --> 08:38.131
and I'd like you
to keep an open mind.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.499
Always.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.669
At this moment, I find myself

08:42.671 --> 08:44.888
craving human intimacy
and physical contact.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.790
Oh, boy.

08:50.128 --> 08:54.064
You know ours is a
relationship of the mind.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.466
Proposal.

08:56.468 --> 08:58.485
One wild night
of torrid lovemaking

08:58.487 --> 09:01.021
that soothes my soul
and inflames my loins.

09:05.526 --> 09:08.328
Counterproposal.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.648
I will gently
stroke your head

09:11.650 --> 09:15.485
and repeat, "Aw,
who's a good Amy""

09:18.172 --> 09:20.540
How about this?

09:20.542 --> 09:23.293
French kissing--
seven minutes in heaven

09:23.295 --> 09:26.263
culminating in second base.

09:29.584 --> 09:32.436
Neck massage...

09:34.355 --> 09:37.057
...then you get me
that beverage.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.014
We cuddle. Final offer.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.567
Very well.

09:54.525 --> 09:56.727

10:18.516 --> 10:22.169
I'm just saying,
second base is right there.

10:29.926 --> 10:31.823
Mm, I'm thinking
about adopting

10:31.824 --> 10:35.276
some quirky affectation,
like a pipe or a monocle

10:35.278 --> 10:37.995
or a handlebar mustache.

10:37.997 --> 10:40.815
For all those girls out there

10:40.817 --> 10:43.684
looking for
the Indian Monopoly man?

10:46.721 --> 10:48.389
This is not a safe place.

10:48.391 --> 10:50.708
You can't share anything here.

10:52.511 --> 10:56.680
The two of you need to get
your women in line!

10:58.016 --> 10:59.300
What?

10:59.302 --> 11:01.101
Last night I was strong-armed

11:01.103 --> 11:03.253
into an evening
of harp music and spooning

11:03.255 --> 11:05.189
with an emotional
Amy Farrah Fowler.

11:05.191 --> 11:06.390
This on a night

11:06.392 --> 11:08.258
that I had originally
designated for solving

11:08.260 --> 11:10.594
the space-time geometry
in higher-spin gravity

11:10.596 --> 11:13.113
and building my Lego Death Star.

11:14.366 --> 11:17.735
And why? Your gal pals,
Penny and Bernadette,

11:17.737 --> 11:20.037
went out shopping for some
wedding nonsense without Amy,

11:20.039 --> 11:22.373
an action they took
with no thought or regard

11:22.375 --> 11:25.492
as to how it would affect me,
the future of string theory

11:25.494 --> 11:28.045
or my Lego fun time!

11:29.331 --> 11:31.165
What do you want <i>us</i>
to do about it?

11:31.167 --> 11:33.500
You clearly weren't listening
to my topic sentence:

11:33.502 --> 11:35.419
Get your women in line!

11:36.504 --> 11:38.973
You make them apologize to Amy
and set things right.

11:38.975 --> 11:41.959
I am a man of science,
not someone's snuggle bunny!

11:41.961 --> 11:44.628
Why do I have
to talk to Penny?

11:44.630 --> 11:45.980
She's not my girlfriend.

11:45.982 --> 11:47.731
You invited her to lunch
four years ago.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.100
Everything about her is on you;
you make it so!

11:53.638 --> 11:55.439
- Moo-shu is Penny.
- Thank you.

11:55.441 --> 11:56.857
Where's Sheldon?

11:56.859 --> 11:58.242
He was up late last night,

11:58.244 --> 12:01.445
so I gave him an early dinner
and put him to bed.

12:01.447 --> 12:02.947
That's so sweet.

12:02.949 --> 12:06.200
Yeah, but now he's gonna be
up at dawn and want to play.

12:06.202 --> 12:08.786
So, listen, guys,

12:08.788 --> 12:11.372
the reason he was up late
is because he was

12:11.374 --> 12:12.673
taking care of Amy.

12:12.675 --> 12:14.208
She's kind of upset.

12:14.210 --> 12:15.259
Why?

12:15.261 --> 12:16.927
Her feelings got hurt
because you guys

12:16.929 --> 12:18.345
went dress shopping without her.

12:18.347 --> 12:20.347
I told you that
would happen.

12:20.349 --> 12:22.633
Okay, look, this is her first
time being a bridesmaid

12:22.635 --> 12:25.002
and she's just getting
a little crazy with it.

12:25.004 --> 12:27.556
She keeps on telling us
stories about bridesmaid

12:27.568 --> 12:29.794
traditions in other cultures,
and they're all about

12:29.795 --> 12:32.513
getting naked and
washing each other.

12:38.984 --> 12:40.734
Yeah, and
she keeps trying

12:40.736 --> 12:42.987
to figure out if our
cycles have synced up

12:42.989 --> 12:46.573
so we can call ourselves
"The Three Menstra-Teers""

12:48.126 --> 12:51.545
We thought it would be easier to look
at dresses one time without her.

12:51.547 --> 12:53.163
I feel terrible.

12:53.188 --> 12:54.332
I know. Me, too.
We'll talk to her.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.582
Hey, wait,

12:55.584 --> 12:56.884
how did she find out?

12:57.802 --> 13:00.254
Raj did it.

13:02.674 --> 13:06.176
And he says he
would do it again.

13:07.679 --> 13:09.229
Hey, I'm sorry.

13:09.231 --> 13:12.049
You sent me the picture;
I wasn't thinking.

13:12.051 --> 13:13.934
- Oh, Howie.
- Well, hey, I'm usually

13:13.936 --> 13:15.385
pretty good at
not blabbing.

13:15.387 --> 13:17.187
You tell me
tons of stuff

13:17.189 --> 13:19.907
about these guys,
and I never repeat it.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.827
- What do you tell him?
- Oh,

13:23.829 --> 13:25.062
you know, just pillow talk.

13:25.064 --> 13:27.614
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

13:27.616 --> 13:29.416
Hold on, did you talk about us
when we were dating?

13:29.418 --> 13:32.686
No. All your little
secrets are fine.

13:37.008 --> 13:39.510
Yes, absolutely fine.

13:41.463 --> 13:44.081
(giggles):
I'll tell you later.

13:47.251 --> 13:50.437
Come on, tumor.

13:50.439 --> 13:54.858
Come on, tumor, Mama needs an
aggressive little glioblastoma.

13:56.111 --> 13:58.779
Yay, brain tumor!

13:58.781 --> 14:03.266
Probably not the same reaction
you had when <i>you</i> got the news.

14:04.402 --> 14:06.904
- Hi.
- Hello.

14:06.906 --> 14:08.489
What are you doing here?

14:08.491 --> 14:10.491
Well, look, we just
wanted to apologize

14:10.493 --> 14:12.826
for not bringing you
with us the other day.

14:12.828 --> 14:15.412
That's not necessary--
it's like <i>Sesame Street</i> says:

14:15.414 --> 14:17.798
"One of these things
is not like the other,

14:17.800 --> 14:21.301
one of these things
should die alone."

14:21.303 --> 14:23.670
Come on, Amy, let us
make it up to you.

14:23.672 --> 14:24.922
We'll have a girl's night;

14:24.924 --> 14:26.507
we'll do whatever
you want.

14:26.509 --> 14:28.125
We can go down
to the Korean baths

14:28.127 --> 14:29.810
and do that thing
you were talking about

14:29.812 --> 14:31.979
where we wash each other.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.799
With-with loofah mitts,
no hands.

14:37.018 --> 14:38.886
It's okay.
I'm glad this happened.

14:38.888 --> 14:41.605
I can stop pretending
that some beautiful girl

14:41.607 --> 14:43.323
and her cute-in-
the-right-light friend

14:43.325 --> 14:45.576
want to hang out with me.

14:45.578 --> 14:47.644
Amy, we're really sorry.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.312
Yeah, we
feel awful.

14:49.314 --> 14:51.498
Don't. I'll be okay.
You're not the first girls

14:51.500 --> 14:54.201
I thought were friends with me
who ended up shunning me.

14:54.203 --> 14:56.420
It's like elementary school,
junior high,

14:56.422 --> 14:58.422
high school, undergrad,
grad school,

14:58.424 --> 15:01.375
and that semester abroad
in Norway all over again.

15:01.377 --> 15:02.926
Oh, come on, Amy.

15:03.762 --> 15:05.679
You don't get it.

15:05.681 --> 15:07.431
Look at this brain.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.267
I don't really want to.

15:10.269 --> 15:12.469
This is us.

15:12.471 --> 15:14.471
Bernadette,
you are the analytical,

15:14.473 --> 15:16.173
scientific left hemisphere.

15:16.175 --> 15:19.359
Penny, you're the creative,
spontaneous right hemisphere.

15:19.361 --> 15:21.612
And where's Amy?

15:21.614 --> 15:24.181
She's right here--
the sad little tumor

15:24.183 --> 15:26.784
no one wants to go
dress shopping with.

15:29.287 --> 15:30.988
Amy, you're not a tumor.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.373
Penny, tell her
she's not a tumor.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.242
(retching)

15:41.365 --> 15:43.967
(phone ringing)

15:43.969 --> 15:46.703
Did you know that when
Alexander Graham Bell

15:46.705 --> 15:48.567
invented the telephone,

15:48.592 --> 15:51.304
he proposed answering
it with "ahoy"?

15:52.844 --> 15:55.062
Ahoy.

15:56.097 --> 15:58.816
I like it.

15:58.818 --> 16:01.351
Amy? Is that you?

16:01.353 --> 16:03.520
Have you been drinking?

16:04.305 --> 16:07.157
I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

16:08.193 --> 16:10.828
Well, all right.
We're on our way.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.529
What's going on?

16:12.531 --> 16:17.201
It would seem Amy is drunk
in a liquor store parking lot.

16:17.203 --> 16:18.669
Really? Amy?

16:18.671 --> 16:20.454
Leonard, be glad
you can't keep a woman.

16:20.456 --> 16:21.922
They are a handful.

16:28.963 --> 16:30.347
Oh, look.

16:30.349 --> 16:32.082
It's Sheldon and little Leonard.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.518
Hi, little Leonard.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.720
Hi, Amy.

16:36.722 --> 16:38.355
Hey, Cuddles.

16:38.357 --> 16:40.524
Cuddles?

16:40.526 --> 16:42.309
Yes, Cuddles.
We cuddled.

16:42.311 --> 16:43.727
Grow up, Leonard.

16:46.064 --> 16:48.315
- Amy, what are you doing here?
- Well,

16:48.317 --> 16:50.534
I came here to get
a bottle of wine

16:50.536 --> 16:53.436
like Penny taught me to do
when you're sad.

16:53.438 --> 16:57.120
Yeah, but why didn't you
go back to your apartment?

16:57.125 --> 16:58.459
Didn't you go
to high school, Leonard?

16:58.460 --> 17:01.628
Parking lots are where
all the cool kids hang out.

17:01.630 --> 17:05.115
Not that the rat bastards
ever invited me.

17:05.117 --> 17:06.666
Maybe we should
get you home.

17:06.669 --> 17:08.617
Oh, hang on, hang on,
hang on. Sheldon,

17:08.619 --> 17:12.339
what would it take for you
to go into that liquor store,

17:12.340 --> 17:13.924
buy a bottle of hooch,

17:13.925 --> 17:16.376
take me across the
street to that motel,

17:16.377 --> 17:19.479
and have your way with me?

17:21.182 --> 17:24.184
Yeah, Sheldon,
what would it take?

17:26.637 --> 17:29.740
I'm begging both of you,
please, let's go.

17:29.742 --> 17:31.158
Okay.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.642
Come on.

17:32.644 --> 17:34.361
- Upsy-daisy.
- Whee!

17:34.363 --> 17:36.997
Ooh, finally someone
found second base.

17:41.836 --> 17:43.904
I know how you feel.

17:43.906 --> 17:48.208
I got a knife slicing
through my frontal lobe, too.

17:48.210 --> 17:49.492
(knocking)

17:49.494 --> 17:51.211
Hi.

17:51.213 --> 17:52.495
What do you want?

17:52.497 --> 17:54.932
Do you want me to give
the friendship bracelet back?

17:54.934 --> 17:58.101
I never gave you
a friendship bracelet.

17:58.103 --> 18:01.772
When we first met, I made one
and pretended you gave it to me.

18:01.774 --> 18:03.824
You can have it back
if you want.

18:03.826 --> 18:08.578
No, you made that for you;
I want <i>you</i> to have it.

18:09.847 --> 18:12.065
We know you're upset,
and you have every right to be,

18:12.067 --> 18:14.451
but if it's okay with you,
we'd like a second chance

18:14.453 --> 18:15.518
to make things right.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.087
PENNY:
We are really sorry,

18:17.089 --> 18:19.740
and we were trying to think
of some way to show you

18:19.742 --> 18:21.208
how much we
care about you.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.242
BERNADETTE:
Which is why

18:22.244 --> 18:24.211
it would mean so much
if you would agree

18:24.213 --> 18:26.246
to be the maid of honor
at my wedding.

18:26.248 --> 18:29.716
What? Wait, is this some kind
of practical joke?

18:29.718 --> 18:31.885
Like in Norway,
when my "friends"

18:31.887 --> 18:35.088
trapped me in a sauna
with a horny otter?

18:37.976 --> 18:41.645
No. I-I want you to be
the maid of honor.

18:41.647 --> 18:43.263
Oh, my gosh.

18:43.265 --> 18:45.983
No one's every asked me to be
the maid of honor before.

18:45.985 --> 18:47.267
Well, that's not true.

18:47.269 --> 18:49.987
Once, but then they all died.

18:51.189 --> 18:53.573
So is that a yes?

18:53.575 --> 18:55.609
(laughs):
Yes. Yes.

18:55.611 --> 18:57.277
Oh, my gosh,

18:57.279 --> 18:58.612
I-I have so much to do.

18:58.614 --> 19:00.998
There's the bridal shower
and the bachelorette party.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.783
What should we do for
the bachelorette party? (gasps)

19:02.785 --> 19:05.902
Oh, I know-- we'll go to
a Native American sweat lodge,

19:05.904 --> 19:07.587
we'll take peyote,
roll around in the mud,

19:07.589 --> 19:09.706
and paint fertility symbols
on Bernadette's naked body.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.258
So that's happening.

19:11.260 --> 19:13.377
Yeah, sure, sure.

19:13.379 --> 19:15.962
Vegas is fun, too.

19:15.964 --> 19:17.014
I feel like crying.

19:17.016 --> 19:18.682
Of course, I could
just be hormonal.

19:18.684 --> 19:21.601
Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are
finally syncing up. Bernadette?

19:21.603 --> 19:23.270
No? Penny?

19:23.272 --> 19:24.888
- Sorry.
- Really?

19:24.890 --> 19:25.856
Okay, yeah.

19:25.858 --> 19:27.107
Yay!

19:36.110 --> 19:37.911
Maid of honor
Amy Farrah Fowler's

19:37.913 --> 19:40.497
amazing behind-the-scenes
wedding video,

19:40.499 --> 19:42.182
take one.

19:43.417 --> 19:45.285
We're just trying on dresses--

19:45.287 --> 19:47.487
do we really need
to record this?

19:47.489 --> 19:50.290
I'm sorry, are <i>you</i>
the maid of honor?

19:51.408 --> 19:53.426
I <i>am</i> the bride.

19:53.428 --> 19:56.129
So no. And action.

19:57.231 --> 19:58.898
What do you think?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.567
I love it!

20:00.569 --> 20:02.335
AMY:
What are you, a nun?

20:02.337 --> 20:06.206
Come on, bestie,
let's see some skin.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.608
BERNADETTE:
Amy! Looking sexy!

20:08.610 --> 20:10.894
You think they don't
have mirrors in there?

20:10.896 --> 20:13.262
I know how I look.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.652
Oh...!

20:19.654 --> 20:22.372
Bernadette, you
look beautiful!

20:22.374 --> 20:24.938
AMY: You do.
- Thank you.

20:24.939 --> 20:27.080
Not Penny beautiful,
but beautiful.

20:29.797 --> 20:31.764
AMY: Come on, bestie,
you're up.

20:31.766 --> 20:33.416
PENNY:
Give me a minute.

20:33.418 --> 20:36.252
What is taking
you so long?

20:36.254 --> 20:38.287
Oh, Amy!
Get the hell out of here!

20:38.289 --> 20:40.590
Sorry, sorry.
(groans): Oh, God.

20:40.592 --> 20:42.141
- Amy!
- Sorry.
