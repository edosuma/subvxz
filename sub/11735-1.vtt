01:04.230 --> 01:07.901
"Young Percival, no more than 15,

01:07.902 --> 01:10.236
from the safety of the thicket,

01:10.237 --> 01:13.247
watched the knights pass by.

01:13.741 --> 01:17.980
He perceived they served
a higher calling,

01:18.179 --> 01:22.015
<i>a calling he felt
stirring within him.</i>

01:22.016 --> 01:26.219
<i>Percival asked his mother permission
to journey to King Arthur's court</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:28.491
<i>and seek knighthood.</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:33.293
<i>His mother had long-feared
this moment would come," Sailor.</i>

01:33.294 --> 01:38.409
"Nonetheless, she gave her son
blessing to pursue his quest.

01:38.732 --> 01:44.737
But she warned him, he would
be tested beyond imagination.

01:44.738 --> 01:49.109
Be deprived, know pain and sadness.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.587
<i>Perhaps, never become a knight.</i>

01:53.147 --> 01:56.954
<i>Percival traveled to
King Arthur's court.</i>

01:57.118 --> 02:00.320
<i>There, he met rebuke and ridicule.</i>

02:00.321 --> 02:05.903
For he was not of noble birth,
nor did he possess skill of arms.

02:06.627 --> 02:10.896
<i>In secret, he studied the
ways of the knights.</i>

02:10.898 --> 02:14.033
<i>His plight caught the
eye of Sir Lancelot</i>

02:14.034 --> 02:16.475
who began to mentor him.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.276
<i>During Percival's
ordeal, the Red Knight</i>

02:23.277 --> 02:29.428
an incarnate of darkness,
sought to destroy the Grail.

02:30.484 --> 02:35.929
He lay waste to King Arthur's
knights, one by one.

02:39.193 --> 02:42.962
<i>Finally, it fell upon
slender Percival</i>

02:42.963 --> 02:46.201
<i>to face the Red Knight."</i>

02:47.001 --> 02:51.115
<i>And Sailor, "Percival had no fear."</i>

02:51.906 --> 02:53.106
Get up, Sailor!

02:53.107 --> 02:55.742
<i>"His years of hardship had
taught him how to suffer.</i>

02:55.743 --> 02:59.720
<i>He was ready in body,
mind and spirit.</i>

03:01.148 --> 03:06.821
<i>He would prove in life or death,
his worthiness in battle.</i>

03:08.389 --> 03:12.859
<i>Percival went forth
with joy in his heart.</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:17.864
<i>For this was what he wanted:
to be an instrument of peace.</i>

03:17.865 --> 03:24.641
<i>To be able to sacrifice all
in service of God and man."</i>

03:54.134 --> 03:56.837
Lead with your right, kid!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.991
Lay on him. Lay on him!

04:18.125 --> 04:21.272
- Get away from him.
- Let him go, let him go.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.831
Let's see some blood!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.410
Work the body!

04:33.907 --> 04:36.018
Kill him, Sailor!

04:37.344 --> 04:40.491
- Come on, let him go.
- Let's see some blood!

04:43.417 --> 04:46.154
You got him, kid! Take him down!

04:51.892 --> 04:53.726
You gotta throw back
here, let's go.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.497
Break it up, boy. Break it up!

05:02.569 --> 05:05.340
Stop the haymakers. Stop
the haymakers! Double up.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.108
Another fight, then, is it?

05:09.109 --> 05:11.789
Once more into the fray.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.425
Once more into the fray.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.157
You're a silly man.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.220
- It's okay, Mom.
- No, it's not okay.

05:21.221 --> 05:25.391
- I'm not gonna get hurt.
- Yes, you will. You're too old.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.300
- I'm in good shape.
- No, you're still old.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.997
I got one or two fights
left in me, right, Ma?

05:30.998 --> 05:34.236
No, you are used up and broken.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.271
I've never been knocked down.

05:38.272 --> 05:41.341
Heh. See, that's why you're broken.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.455
A man should know when
to go down. You don't.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.949
You never did.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.952
I never should have said it to you.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.153
Said what?

05:54.154 --> 05:57.223
That I want to go to
Ireland before it comes.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.732
You didn't, I did.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.000
You are such a liar.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.006
Anyways, loser's
purse will cover it.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.938
Oh. I see you're aiming high.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.417
Father Brennan wants
to talk to you.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.257
About what? And don't say God.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.588
About what's coming.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.023
I'm not afraid.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.533
You should pass in a
state of grace, Ma.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.001
You still believe, don't you?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.432
Yeah, I do.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.271
How can you after
what he did to you?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.575
Only a monster takes the innocent.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.351
If there is a God, it's a monster.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.277
A doer of evil and wicked things.

06:51.278 --> 06:54.580
I will not seek grace
from a monster,

06:54.581 --> 06:57.489
nor will a monster give it.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.196
Will you talk to Father Brennan?

07:04.691 --> 07:08.161
Maybe. If he takes off his robes
and shoves a crucifix up his arse.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.773
Maybe.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.666
Nice, Ma.

07:13.534 --> 07:17.045
- I'll ask him, see what he says.
- Good.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.742
Have you gone to see Albright?
Will he be there with you?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.710
- He can't be there.
- Why not?

07:24.711 --> 07:27.280
He's busy at Safe Hope.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.549
- I see.
- He's a good man.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.856
If he was a good man, he would
talk you out of this fight.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.564
No one's gonna talk me
out of the fight, Ma.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.764
- Lay it on, Sailor!
- You've already got the game!

07:45.399 --> 07:47.806
It's all you, Sailor. Come on!

07:48.335 --> 07:50.811
Use your jab, man. Use your jab.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.511
Come on, man. Come on! Come on.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.792
Back to your corners,
guys, let's go.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.293
- You're done.
- Yeah.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.763
Hey, kid. Get over here.
Come on, sit down.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.699
<i>Sailor! Sailor!</i>

08:19.700 --> 08:23.035
All right, come on, sit down.
You ain't got all day. Come on.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.172
<i>Sailor! Sailor! Sailor!</i>

08:26.173 --> 08:28.741
You wanna make it 10 rounds,
you gotta listen to me.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.310
You're dropping your
right hand, like that.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.945
Keep your head on his shoulder.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.280
- Can't you do that?
- Yeah.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.451
It's time for you to put this old man
down now. You do it now, hear?

08:38.452 --> 08:40.219
- Yes, sir.
- No more fooling around.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.155
That's enough of this nonsense.
You're young, man, and fast.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.859
Put him down so we can
go home, all right?

08:50.397 --> 08:53.266
Let's take a look,
Sailor. How's that eye?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.434
- Good, doc. It's good.
- Are you sure?

08:55.435 --> 08:56.669
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.272
That opens up anymore,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

08:59.273 --> 09:02.545
- I'll do my best, doc.
- Do the best you can.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.411
Oh, great.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.980
Hey, King's fine. You check
that old man over there.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.957
- He ain't so fine.
- Back off, Cubby.

09:11.618 --> 09:14.687
- Looking better than Sailor.
- I'm fine.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.266
Didn't think you
could take a punch.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.295
- I can take a punch.
- You're proving it, kid.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.975
You're gonna get up close so
you can do some damage, okay?

09:27.634 --> 09:29.438
Concentrate.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.520
I wanna have it.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.022
You don't know what that means.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.489
Yes, I do.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.418
- No, you don't.
- It means work.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.687
It means money.

09:47.688 --> 09:51.131
- I can make money.
- How?

09:52.893 --> 09:55.266
Well, I can box.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.139
And I have some modeling jobs too.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.244
We're too young.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.678
- Too young for what?
- To have a baby.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.776
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.945
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.314
- No, you don't.
- I wanna marry you.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.725
I wanna marry you right
now. This morning.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.558
And I'll take care
of you and our baby.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.537
I promise you that.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.601
We have a family.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.948
I've never had that before.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.548
Me neither.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.682
Let's have our baby.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.797
Okay.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.960
Okay.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.230
Okay.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.263
But, King...

11:06.299 --> 11:09.412
I wanna give this baby
something besides life.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.277
What?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.479
I wanna give it something
it can be proud of.

11:18.612 --> 11:22.615
You keep him at a distance with
that jab. You dance around, huh?

11:22.616 --> 11:26.052
That man throws some wild
hooks, you know? Duck.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.021
Stop. You cannot win a fight
laying on a guy, okay?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.323
So let's win it. You
cannot outmuscle this kid.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.826
You cannot outfight him
and you can't outrun him.

11:33.827 --> 11:37.129
But you outweigh him and you can
outthink him. You wanna win it?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.398
- Yeah.
- You're the heavier one, lay on him.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.803
Keep your head on the right side of him.
Let the kid get cocky. Listen to me.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.572
Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

11:46.573 --> 11:49.208
What the hell's the matter?
You wanna win the fight?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.244
Keep your head on that right
shoulder. Once you get that rhythm,

11:52.245 --> 11:55.289
setup, he drops down,
you cross him, okay?

12:10.097 --> 12:14.166
Cubby. And what's this
I hear about King?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.635
I'm gonna give the
kid another chance.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.872
- King is a screwup.
- No, no, he's all cleaned up now.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.709
- The kid does have talent. Real talent.
- Yeah, he's always had talent.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.544
I poured a lot of money into him,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.980
and you gotta have it
to go with that talent.

12:27.981 --> 12:31.751
- Yeah, well, he's going to have a baby.
- There's a disaster waiting to happen.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.353
He got married to a
nice, young girl.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.789
He was my fighter before
you stole him from me.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.791
I did not steal him. Hey, look.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.293
You've got that night
coming up at the Lion Head?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.304
- Yeah.
- I want you to get King a fight there.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.466
- Maybe as an undercard.
- No, no, no, main event.

12:47.467 --> 12:52.071
- What? Look, King is no main event.
- Yes, he is.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.481
I'll put up the purse, man.
Ten-thousand dollars.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.742
Ten rounds.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.978
You really think he has
his head on straight?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.980
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.848
All right, I'll take
a piece of him.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.785
No, no, no. Ha, ha.
He doesn't like you.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.420
- I'll take 50 percent of him.
- He's not for sale.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.524
Hey, look, you know he was
my fighter before you took him.

13:11.525 --> 13:18.030
I didn't steal him. Hey, you know why
all your fighters leave you, man? Huh?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.432
- Because you steal them from me.
- Yeah.

13:20.433 --> 13:25.404
Same reason why your wife left you.
The same reason why I left you.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.640
Just give me a piece of the kid.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.377
Hey, look.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.514
You line up something for King, hm?

13:35.515 --> 13:38.184
Someone the kid could handle, huh?

13:38.185 --> 13:43.189
More than just a warm body,
but somebody he could beat, huh?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.057
I want it kept local.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.467
I don't wanna bear the expense
of bringing somebody in here.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.063
What about Charlie Simms?

13:51.064 --> 13:54.438
No, he's in prison. Armed robbery.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.368
Teddy Bigfoot?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.205
Teddy Bigfoot? Teddy Bigfoot,
man, he's a lot of Bigfoot.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.010
Man, he's 350 pounds now.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.177
- Bigfoot, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.880
Hey.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.318
How about Sailor O'Connor?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.890
- Sailor?
- Yeah.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.129
Is he still fighting?

14:14.154 --> 14:16.188
No, but it might not really matter.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.191
I mean, if I could get him
to take one more fight.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.760
- People loved him.
- Yeah, yeah, he was very popular.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.630
Everybody wanted to see if he
was gonna get knocked down.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.132
- Yeah.
- And every fighter wanted to be the first.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.868
That's a good hook, man.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.769
Yeah, that'd be big if King

14:30.770 --> 14:34.039
could knock Sailor down. Heh.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.508
- That's good.
- Yeah. I'm gonna run it by King.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.110
- I'll talk to Sailor.
- Yup.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.547
- Hey, I want a piece of the kid.
- Not going to happen, man.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.483
- Well, we'll see.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.784
<i>Why should we bother
to go see the doctor?</i>

15:07.040 --> 15:08.741
What's there to talk about?

15:08.742 --> 15:11.855
If you're dying, you're dying.
I know I'm dying.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.887
How do you know?

15:17.250 --> 15:21.557
Tell me you wouldn't know if you
were rotting from the inside out.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.793
It's cancer.

15:27.794 --> 15:31.339
Cancer, rot, no difference.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.666
Ma...

15:32.666 --> 15:37.136
Aw. Don't get all melancholy on me.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.306
I think it'd be good if you and I
went and saw a doctor together.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.512
- Yeah, well, you go see him if you want.
- Ma, there may be some pain.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.822
How long did he say I have?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.784
- Ma.
- Oh, don't be such a baby.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.726
How long did he say I have?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.164
Six months.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.104
I'm sorry.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.602
Sorry for what?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.814
No one's getting out alive.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.712
Is there anything I can do for you?

16:21.081 --> 16:26.697
Well, it might be nice to take one
last trip to Ireland before it comes.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.965
That'd be nice. Maybe you and me.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.195
Yeah.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.170
King, come on.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.351
Go box. Go box!

16:48.008 --> 16:49.448
Let's go home.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.549
<i>She's been in for five years.
She's asked me to be there</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:33.697
- for her parole hearing.
- You gonna go?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.589
I don't know.

17:36.890 --> 17:41.561
I've gotten to know her a lot better
through the letters that she sent me.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.402
She wants to speak with
you if she gets out.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.836
I can't do that.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.781
You can try.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.183
Sean, I don't have it in me.

17:58.812 --> 18:02.255
Sailor, her loss is
as great as yours.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.829
Is it?

18:06.853 --> 18:11.900
I'm sorry. Loss can't be measured.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.505
No. No, it can't.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.771
Do you want her to
continue to suffer?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.808
Do you

18:29.809 --> 18:33.047
want her to continue to suffer?

18:35.048 --> 18:37.922
Yeah. I think I do.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.595
Don't you think she's
suffered enough?

18:40.887 --> 18:45.661
Sean, I thought we agreed,
you can't measure suffering.

18:48.895 --> 18:52.076
Do you have no pity for her?

18:52.765 --> 18:56.503
You know, my ma has a
saying about pity:

18:57.403 --> 19:00.606
Pity arrests the heart

19:00.607 --> 19:03.344
and unites it with those
who have wronged us.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.415
I need to go see Rose.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.648
Won't do any good,
she's at war with God.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.294
Yeah.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.121
You taking confessions
today, Father?

19:16.122 --> 19:18.632
You have nothing to confess,

19:18.725 --> 19:22.027
other than what we
just talked about.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.946
Yes.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.307
I'm remorseful, yes.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.823
And I know what that
means, really means.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.188
I violated the most basic

19:49.189 --> 19:52.893
and primary of relationships.

19:59.999 --> 20:04.545
Destroyed the lives that
were entrusted to me.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.184
I'm a ghost.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.024
Haunting of what's left of life,

20:19.953 --> 20:22.258
until there is no life.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.297
But the pain I suffer

20:32.165 --> 20:36.939
is nothing compared
to the pain I caused.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.797
Quit pushing. Quit
pushing there, King.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.035
- We shouldn't have let him do this.
- It's done. Forget it.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.169
Thank you again for seeing me.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.238
The mayor has got an
election coming up,

21:13.239 --> 21:15.440
and he would really love
to have your support.

21:15.441 --> 21:19.144
Thanks. Well, you tell him
to come see me himself.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.913
Well, you know, the mayor,
he's... He's a very busy man.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.216
Oh. Oh, Well... Heh.

21:24.217 --> 21:28.253
Thank God. Thank God that I
have absolutely nothing to do.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.623
And the truth is, I don't
believe in politics.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.992
You don't? Well, what do
you believe in, then?

21:33.993 --> 21:37.729
I believe in, um,
the luxuries of life.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.332
Food, shelter, clothing.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.701
You know? You tell your mayor that

21:42.702 --> 21:45.604
and then tell him come
and talk to me. Okay?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.046
We need some more bread over here.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.411
Okay, come on.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.285
What's on your mind?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.717
- I got a fight coming up.
- You got a what?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.419
A fight.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.861
A fight? I thought we
left it all behind.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.930
It's just one fight.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.593
You feeling some
need to get punished

22:08.594 --> 22:12.364
because I'll take a hammer and beat
you with it, if that's what you'd like.

22:12.365 --> 22:15.546
- No.
- Well, then why?

22:16.936 --> 22:19.707
Do you feel you gotta prove
something to somebody?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.507
- Huh?
- No.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.552
No. So why?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.287
I miss it.

22:31.351 --> 22:35.053
Okay, well, I mean,
you know, I miss it too.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.258
But I don't miss getting
my face busted up.

22:40.426 --> 22:44.563
Mikey, it ain't the same for me.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.141
What ain't the same?

22:47.433 --> 22:51.012
Life. Life as a civilian.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.538
So... So, um,

22:53.539 --> 22:56.743
when you get in the ring, you
feel more civilized, is that it?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.657
It's the fight I know.

23:00.780 --> 23:04.282
Well, there's just... There's a lot
of fights out there, a lot of them.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.819
I mean, if that's what you want,
we got a lot. We can find them.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.022
I'm suited to this one.

23:11.324 --> 23:13.592
Well, I could argue that.

23:13.593 --> 23:18.333
Your record ain't that good, you know.
Heh. I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.868
Even when I lost, I knew who I was.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.980
I was a fighter.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.852
All right, look, let's just
cut the bullshit. I, um...

23:31.177 --> 23:35.621
I mean, bottom line is, I really
don't want you to fight again, okay?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.724
I'd like you in my corner.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.533
I can't, man. I just can't do that.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.826
Well, help me get ready.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.997
I can't do that either.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.233
You've always been there with me.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.832
I always will be.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.635
But I don't have to be there
and watch you get destroyed.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.571
- I've never been knocked down.
- Well, that's great.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.082
That's great. We'll keep
it like that, okay?

24:07.713 --> 24:11.122
All right. Just...

24:12.318 --> 24:14.429
Just one more. One more fight.

24:16.289 --> 24:17.695
No.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.762
Because I love you, man, I do.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.204
I love you and I do
not see the need.

24:26.365 --> 24:30.135
- I told you the need.
- You didn't tell me shit!

24:30.136 --> 24:32.971
What'd you tell me?
"I didn't get knocked down."

24:32.972 --> 24:37.676
What, do you wanna prolong this, or extend
this stupid, idiotic legacy you got?

24:37.677 --> 24:39.845
That's what you told me.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.583
I can't do this without you.

24:46.252 --> 24:49.626
Please, man, just don't
do this to me, okay?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.199
I need your help on this.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.029
Jesus.

24:57.029 --> 25:01.109
I just... I just can't. I just...

25:03.202 --> 25:05.404
I just can't.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.649
Take his head off, King!

25:15.481 --> 25:16.681
Come on, ref.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.402
Come on, let him go. Let him go.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.162
Come on, old man!

25:26.626 --> 25:28.560
Kill him, Sailor!

25:28.561 --> 25:30.434
Finish him off, King!

25:37.270 --> 25:38.470
Oh...

25:38.471 --> 25:40.438
You gotta punch back
or we'll stop it.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.641
You're getting schooled, Sailor!

25:43.976 --> 25:46.111
Once more into the fray.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.192
Sailor!

26:02.628 --> 26:04.329
What you doing here, Eddie?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.431
I wanna talk.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.001
- About what?
- A fight.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.137
Look, do you wanna fight?

26:12.138 --> 26:15.607
I haven't had a fight in four
years. That's a long time.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.710
Look, it doesn't matter.
You got a reputation.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.346
Sixty-three fights,
never knocked down.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.714
That's right.

26:22.715 --> 26:27.252
Yeah, and a lot of people would pay
to just see something knock you down.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.991
Come on, Sailor, you don't
tell me you don't miss it.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.459
Yeah, I miss it.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.394
Who would I be fighting?

26:36.395 --> 26:40.065
He's a kid. His name
is King Soloman.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.841
Never heard of him.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.411
Cubby likes him.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.411
Oh, he's with Cubby.

26:47.506 --> 26:48.840
How is Cubby?

26:48.841 --> 26:52.811
He's good. But, look,
I used to have this kid,

26:52.812 --> 26:55.080
and he's gonna be mine
before the fight.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.659
What about you? You got management?

26:58.250 --> 26:59.986
Does it look like I got management?

27:01.420 --> 27:04.328
I could line you up
with some stuff.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.100
I don't think so.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.394
This kid good?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.396
He's a pretty good fighter.

27:11.397 --> 27:15.500
Look, he's got nice moves,
but he can't take a punch.

27:15.501 --> 27:18.079
I think you could beat him.

27:18.571 --> 27:21.272
Look, you go out on a win.
That's the way to go out.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.511
Worst-case scenario,
loser's purse is 2 grand.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.787
Four.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.588
Four what?

27:34.487 --> 27:35.927
Four thousand.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.525
- Three.
- Four.

27:40.526 --> 27:44.333
Come on, when's the last time
you made 4 grand for a fight?

27:44.964 --> 27:48.543
- Hm. Never.
- Exactly.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.137
Eddie, you're a good promoter.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.318
You'll make a lot of
money out of this.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.621
Four thousand.

28:03.949 --> 28:07.653
All right, deal. Four grand.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.588
The right!

28:38.851 --> 28:41.497
Over the top with the left hook!

28:52.832 --> 28:54.773
Come on, Sailor,
keep your hands up.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.709
Good time? Ha-ha-ha. Hm? Hm?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.997
King?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.770
Baby, that you?

29:36.375 --> 29:39.454
I can hear you.

29:42.047 --> 29:43.692
King!

29:47.686 --> 29:49.957
Baby boy?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.332
Yeah, Mama?

29:55.694 --> 29:57.737
Come here.

30:15.948 --> 30:19.061
Baby, where you been?
Mama miss you.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.789
With Peg.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.967
She giving you money or
are you free fucking her?

30:34.133 --> 30:37.473
I just came to get my
stuff, Mama. I'm leaving.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.281
Leaving where?

30:43.943 --> 30:45.645
Here.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.596
You're just like him.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.021
You're just like your father.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.101
Nope. No, I'm not at all.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.169
Yeah, you are. You're
a fucking taker.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.732
You just fucking take

31:07.733 --> 31:11.244
and take and take.

31:11.971 --> 31:17.120
I used to be something.
I used to have a face.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.818
I used to have tits.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.558
I did it all for you.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.597
Now what do I got, King?

31:35.828 --> 31:38.167
Now what do I got?

31:40.566 --> 31:42.473
I don't know.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.880
Look at this fucking shit hole.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.648
You gonna go and see...

31:56.649 --> 31:58.487
Bobby?

31:59.485 --> 32:02.325
That modeling stuff.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.066
That's good.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.477
Bobby will take care of you.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.849
I'm never coming back, Mama.

32:30.883 --> 32:32.653
You'll be back.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.266
You'll be back.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.536
You'll be back.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.551
You're lucky, old man.

32:57.076 --> 33:00.814
- We love you, Sailor!
- Go back to your corner.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.360
Come on, guys, get
back to your corners.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.700
Come on! Come on! Come on!

33:12.658 --> 33:14.963
Don't get too cocky, boy.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.972
He got knocked out.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.327
What do you want?

33:44.957 --> 33:46.761
Wanted to talk a minute.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.404
You mind if I don't listen?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.275
Well, yeah.

33:52.998 --> 33:55.974
I been watching you, and
you're looking pretty good.

33:57.002 --> 34:00.149
You're training hard,
showing discipline.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.243
I like what I see.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.619
I'm just glad I put you on
the card at the Lion Head.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.353
Cubby got me on that card.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.784
No, I did.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.860
And I could put you on
bigger cards than Cubby can.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.821
I'm with Cubby.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.933
You used to be with me.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.304
Used to be.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.641
You owe me, and you know it.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.940
Look, I could take you
places that Cubby can't.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.511
You want real fights and
real purses, right?

34:34.639 --> 34:37.141
I hear you got a family coming,

34:37.141 --> 34:40.551
and you wanna take care of
them the best way you can.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.183
You're gonna need money for that.

34:44.650 --> 34:49.025
You don't wanna end up being
a deadbeat nigger dad. Heh.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.202
I never will be.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.565
That's good.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.697
You know, this fight
is important to you.

34:59.698 --> 35:03.201
If you can knock down Sailor,
you got a name for yourself.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.348
No one has ever knocked him down.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.706
I'm not gonna knock him down.
I'm gonna knock him the fuck out.

35:08.707 --> 35:12.480
Yeah. See, I like that enthusiasm.

35:13.078 --> 35:17.522
Heh. You know, you're gonna win
a lot of money in this game.

35:18.884 --> 35:22.588
You just gotta be with the right
person who knows how to play it.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.768
And you do, right?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.198
What can I say?

35:29.294 --> 35:31.064
I'm with Cubby.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.265
Think about it.

35:34.266 --> 35:37.502
I'll give you money to
train, money to live on.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.273
And I'll move you up quick.

35:43.442 --> 35:47.089
All you gotta do is leave
Cubby after the fight.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.890
I'm with Cubby.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.859
Don't be stupid.

35:58.757 --> 36:02.530
All right. Be stupid.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.530
And I'll tell you what.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.735
You're not worth my
time or my money.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.024
- Sailor, how you doing?
- He's doing great, thanks.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.526
I'm talking to Sailor.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.762
You don't look good.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.730
- How many fingers?
- Two.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.098
How many fingers?

36:41.099 --> 36:42.733
- Two.
- He said two.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.602
Boxes like that again,
takes a shit-kicking

36:44.603 --> 36:46.504
like that, I'm stopping the fight.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.806
Do me a favor, I gotta
do something here.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.748
- Mike, I'll stop the fight.
- I gotcha.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.450
Go fuck yourself.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.087
Gordo!

36:57.282 --> 36:59.550
Gordo!

36:59.551 --> 37:01.819
- We need to stop the fight.
- Father, sit down.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.555
- You need to stop this fight, Gordo.
- Father.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.058
- Please, just stop the fight.
- Father, sit down.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.671
Please, we know how this
is gonna end, Gordo.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.398
Double up on the left hand.
Double up on left.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.534
- Keep busy on him. Don't lay on him.
- Yeah.

37:16.535 --> 37:19.670
- Make him push you. Wear him out.
- Yeah.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.974
You're letting that old man
shame you. Disgusting.

37:22.975 --> 37:27.089
You're young, strong
and fast. Disgusting.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.950
Bobby, what do you
want us to do today?

37:32.951 --> 37:36.420
Yo, King, baby. You're late.
It's time to take off your clothes

37:36.421 --> 37:38.021
and get that dick hard. Am I right?

37:39.124 --> 37:40.359
Am I right?

37:42.894 --> 37:45.263
What is it, King?

37:45.264 --> 37:46.697
What is it? What's the matter?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.969
You need a fluffer?

37:49.401 --> 37:52.837
Come on, buddy. You got two hot
chicks here for you, let's go.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.245
Come on. Let's do this, huh?

37:59.044 --> 38:02.113
- Can't do this.
- What do you mean, you can't?

38:02.114 --> 38:05.783
It's only gonna take about an hour.
I already paid your mom the money.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.759
She's your problem.

38:08.287 --> 38:09.920
What are you doing, King?

38:09.921 --> 38:12.658
King, you're killing me here,
buddy. You're killing me!

38:21.166 --> 38:25.439
...you go down. You work
on your jab, all right?

38:28.140 --> 38:30.274
Hey, hey. Good.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.109
You got to remember
what I told you.

38:32.110 --> 38:35.257
You got to close up your stance a
little bit so you have balance, huh?

38:38.116 --> 38:39.454
What are you doing here?

38:39.718 --> 38:42.420
I need a fight. I need
to make some money.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.066
You can make money other ways.

38:44.923 --> 38:49.037
- I like fighting.
- Ah, nobody sane likes fighting.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.874
I'm sane, and I like
it and I'm good.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.273
But you can't take a punch.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.580
I can take a punch.
I just don't like to.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.874
Ah. That's sane.

39:03.308 --> 39:06.377
Get me a fight. Please.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.512
What do you want that
money for? Drugs?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.454
- No, that's over.
- Are you sure?

39:10.649 --> 39:14.126
It's over. My girl is pregnant.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.388
I mean, my wife is pregnant.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.857
- You married?
- Yup.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.935
You're an idiot.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.029
- How old are you now? Nineteen?
- Twenty.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.143
Twenty. Oh. And how old is she?

39:29.134 --> 39:30.835
What's her name?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.310
Peg. She's 18.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.580
Ah... Babies having babies.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.876
She's gonna be a good
mom, I know she is.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.179
She's gonna be a good mom and you're
gonna be a good daddy, right?

39:42.180 --> 39:45.520
Yeah. Cubby, I can fight.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.685
I can be somebody.

39:47.686 --> 39:51.422
Go be somebody with somebody
else, and let me be. Huh?

39:51.423 --> 39:53.102
You know I can fight.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.037
I don't know if you have
the heart or the head.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.296
Just give me a shot.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.272
You had your shot!

40:02.334 --> 40:04.639
You know what you did before, huh?

40:09.007 --> 40:12.410
I'm sorry about before.
I know I disappointed you.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.888
- I... I didn't know better.
- You got that right.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.384
Can you please just give me
another chance?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.160
Hey!

40:23.021 --> 40:26.157
You watch your stance, huh?
You gotta put your left...

40:26.158 --> 40:28.392
I told you not to be so wide, huh?

40:28.393 --> 40:30.461
Close up your stance,
and you keep your left

40:30.462 --> 40:32.232
in his face, huh?

40:33.365 --> 40:34.600
Hey, kid!

40:35.133 --> 40:36.869
King!

40:46.845 --> 40:49.685
You are not going to flake out
on me this time, are you?

40:50.115 --> 40:51.555
Hm?

40:51.716 --> 40:55.659
- No.
- Are you gonna stick to it? Train?

40:56.221 --> 40:57.855
Come to the gym on time?

40:57.856 --> 41:00.391
Yeah, I promise. You know...
You know I got talent.

41:00.392 --> 41:03.095
Yeah, but are you willing
to put in the hard yards?

41:05.230 --> 41:08.132
Give me a fight, you'll see.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.744
Hey.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.341
If you fail me this time...
Hey, look at me.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.075
If you fail me this
time, it's over.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.222
Huh? You got it?

41:21.079 --> 41:23.520
- I got it.
- All right.

41:24.316 --> 41:29.431
Now, this is against my better
judgment, but I will give you a fight.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.363
All right?

41:37.262 --> 41:38.696
Thanks, Cubby.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.564
It won't be much.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.870
That's okay, I just...

41:43.935 --> 41:47.207
I just need something
to get me going again.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.651
Let's go, box!

41:54.412 --> 41:56.148
Use your jab!

42:05.557 --> 42:07.758
Get those hands low,
Sailor, let's go.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.131
Break it up!

42:09.794 --> 42:12.329
Take the old man out, King!

42:12.330 --> 42:14.271
Put him in the hospital, King!

42:23.041 --> 42:27.177
Head butt, really? That's how you gonna
fight? Huh? Huh? You ain't know how to box!

42:27.178 --> 42:30.214
- You're a boxer, let's go.
- This is dirty boxing.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.419
- Get to your corners.
- I apologize.

42:34.586 --> 42:37.054
Let me see your head.
Let me see your head!

42:37.055 --> 42:39.223
All right. All right.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.292
You know Sailor's got
a fight coming up.

42:41.293 --> 42:43.473
Yeah, yeah, I know.

42:44.996 --> 42:46.530
He can't do it.

42:46.531 --> 42:51.302
No. But I'll bet you're gonna
be in his corner though, right?

42:51.303 --> 42:53.237
What am I gonna do? It's Sailor.

42:53.238 --> 42:56.317
"What am I gonna do?" I mean,
you could try talking to him.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.778
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.525
You know what this is all about.

43:04.649 --> 43:06.851
Well, I don't know.
He told me he missed it.

43:07.052 --> 43:11.355
Yeah, well, that's all well and
good, but it's his mother.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.126
His mom's dying.

43:14.459 --> 43:16.138
Huh.

43:17.796 --> 43:19.873
That's kind of
inconvenient for her.

43:20.665 --> 43:25.102
Rose wants to visit the old
country again before she passes.

43:25.103 --> 43:28.750
He gets 4 grand, even if he loses.

43:29.174 --> 43:32.409
Yeah, but, I mean, you and I could
put up that money for him, and...

43:32.410 --> 43:34.749
- He wouldn't take it.
- You tried already?

43:34.779 --> 43:35.980
I offered him money.

43:35.981 --> 43:39.216
I said, "All you gotta do, come by
the shop a couple times a week.

43:39.217 --> 43:43.559
Tell stories to the guys." And he
goes, "No, I don't take handouts."

43:48.727 --> 43:51.228
Are you a religious man?

43:51.229 --> 43:52.830
Why do you ask?

43:52.831 --> 43:57.173
Oh, just to see if you reside in
that papas camp of blind obedience.

44:00.071 --> 44:04.074
Well, no, no, I'm not
especially religious.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.010
But they call you Brother Albright.

44:06.011 --> 44:08.145
Ah, yeah, well...

44:08.146 --> 44:11.215
That's down at the harbor,
it's more of a term of affection.

44:11.216 --> 44:14.685
You know? "Hey, brother, hey,
bro." You know, that's all.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.263
What do you do down there?

44:16.988 --> 44:21.291
We're just a group of
people that do service.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.593
Service?

44:22.594 --> 44:25.468
Service, you know,
helping others in need.

44:26.731 --> 44:29.207
- Well, that's much better than religion.
- Yes.

44:33.104 --> 44:36.478
Ahem. You know that,
um... Yeah, thanks.

44:36.808 --> 44:39.343
...Sailor has another
fight lined up.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.711
I know.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.447
And he wants me to
be in the corner.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.149
He said you couldn't do it.

44:45.150 --> 44:48.285
Probably more correct is
you don't want to do it.

44:48.286 --> 44:49.486
That would be correct.

44:49.487 --> 44:51.922
- You don't want him to fight, do you?
- No, no, no.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.858
- And I don't suppose you do either.
- No, certainly not.

44:54.859 --> 44:58.165
God only knows why his
brains aren't scrambled.

44:59.964 --> 45:02.838
Look, um, Rose, I, uh...

45:03.768 --> 45:08.505
I hope I'm not talking out of turn
here, but Max told me that the reason

45:08.506 --> 45:11.475
he's taking the fight is because
he wants to take you to Ireland.

45:11.476 --> 45:15.488
No need to be delicate. He wants
to take me to Ireland before I die.

45:16.147 --> 45:17.915
I got it, but...

45:17.916 --> 45:20.984
see, the thing is that
Max and I could easily,

45:20.985 --> 45:22.453
easily cover that trip.

45:22.454 --> 45:25.828
No. Sailor would never
go for it, nor would I.

45:26.458 --> 45:31.368
But I would appreciate it if you and
Max would be in my boy's corner.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.476
You gonna be at the fight?

45:34.532 --> 45:37.542
No. I've never seen one of
Sailor's fights. Never will.

45:38.837 --> 45:43.440
Sixty-four fights. This
will be his 64th fight.

45:43.441 --> 45:45.642
My boy has a terrible
record, doesn't he?

45:45.643 --> 45:47.379
Yes, ma'am, he does. Ha, ha.

45:47.645 --> 45:50.881
But the man has never been down.
Never.

45:50.882 --> 45:53.183
But you see, a man should
know when to go down.

45:53.184 --> 45:55.986
A man should know when to quit.

45:55.987 --> 45:59.725
Yes, you think he
should. But, your boy...

46:01.025 --> 46:05.139
I mean, the guy is, um... I just
never seen anything like it.

46:05.697 --> 46:08.899
I mean, I thought I
was tough, but I'm...

46:08.900 --> 46:11.101
I'm like Tinker Bell or
something. I mean...

46:11.102 --> 46:14.538
I mean, I see him
get hit with, uh...

46:14.539 --> 46:16.874
With hammers, with...
I mean, and...

46:16.875 --> 46:19.777
It would kill an elephant.
He just will not go down.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.584
I just don't believe
it and I don't get it.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.291
Yeah, well...

46:28.887 --> 46:34.691
When he was a little boy, about 10,

46:34.692 --> 46:37.227
we were driving in the car.

46:37.228 --> 46:40.430
<i>His father had been drinking.</i>

46:40.431 --> 46:43.066
<i>He started hitting me hard.</i>

46:43.067 --> 46:44.468
Keep my mouth shut?

46:44.469 --> 46:45.636
Yes, your mouth shut.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.004
- Our boy's in the back...
- Unh!

46:47.005 --> 46:48.539
- Dad!
- You think I don't know

46:48.540 --> 46:50.073
the kid's in the backseat?

46:50.074 --> 46:52.376
You... You need help.

46:52.377 --> 46:55.524
You know what I need?
For you to shut up!

46:55.747 --> 46:57.426
Dad!

46:58.249 --> 46:59.983
- Get off!
- Sailor.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.418
Get off!

47:01.419 --> 47:04.225
<i>His father slammed his head
against the side window</i>

47:04.489 --> 47:07.329
so hard, it cracked the glass.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.102
Sailor passed out.

47:12.764 --> 47:15.566
George hit me some more

47:15.567 --> 47:18.509
and then he threw us
both out of the car.

47:20.939 --> 47:24.985
When Sailor came to, we were
at the side of the road.

47:25.210 --> 47:26.677
It wasn't your fault.

47:26.678 --> 47:28.412
<i>My face was a mess.</i>

47:28.413 --> 47:30.247
Are you okay?

47:30.248 --> 47:34.555
<i>He said he was okay,
but he really wasn't.</i>

47:35.787 --> 47:38.255
He knocked you out, Sailor.

47:38.256 --> 47:42.593
<i>Sailor vowed it would
never happen again.</i>

47:42.594 --> 47:45.775
<i>Maybe that's it. I don't know.</i>

47:50.201 --> 47:55.077
Or maybe he's just got a stupid
Irish head made of pig iron.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.780
But my boy's got sand.
That's for sure.

47:59.844 --> 48:02.081
Yes, he does.

48:03.314 --> 48:04.959
Um, what happened to your husband?

48:05.183 --> 48:08.819
I don't know. He left the day it
happened. I never saw him again.

48:08.820 --> 48:10.254
Never heard from him.

48:10.255 --> 48:13.527
- Sorry.
- Oh. There's no need to be.

48:13.825 --> 48:17.336
Please just be in my boy's corner.

48:20.398 --> 48:24.434
Yes, ma'am. Max and I will be.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.170
And you tell him when
it's time, you got that?

48:27.171 --> 48:29.282
You tell him when it's time.

48:29.841 --> 48:35.684
Because... Well, Sailor
just doesn't know.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.715
- I'm fine!
- King, let's have a look at that.

48:38.716 --> 48:40.554
I'm fine! You check him!

48:42.854 --> 48:45.125
Okay, that's clock.

48:46.858 --> 48:48.093
Aw...

48:48.760 --> 48:51.201
Come on, you're standing
like an ape. Come on!

48:56.267 --> 48:59.471
- Quick on your feet, Sailor!
- Double up the left hand, baby.

48:59.971 --> 49:02.048
Come on, boy! Hurry up now!

49:02.373 --> 49:04.018
Double that up, baby.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.718
That's it. Now, watch out for that.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.353
Break it up! Break it up!

49:16.354 --> 49:18.192
Come on, Sailor!

49:23.461 --> 49:24.761
Come on, King!

49:24.762 --> 49:26.897
You're getting schooled, Sailor!

49:26.898 --> 49:29.442
Break it up. Come on, break it up!

50:05.269 --> 50:06.846
Grab him.

50:09.107 --> 50:11.150
Come on. Knock him out!

50:11.509 --> 50:12.909
Let's go home, boy.

50:12.910 --> 50:15.556
- Break it up, guys.
- Hit him again.

50:19.917 --> 50:22.723
You got him, King! Take him down!

50:29.527 --> 50:32.333
Hey, come on, guys. Back
to your corners. Let's go!

50:34.766 --> 50:36.274
Get going!

50:37.969 --> 50:40.775
Put him out of his misery!
Come on, King!

50:42.540 --> 50:45.108
Sit the fuck down. Stop, come here.

50:45.109 --> 50:47.110
Come on, Sailor! Get the kid!

50:47.111 --> 50:48.915
Let me have a look at you here.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.049
You're letting that
old man beat you!

50:52.050 --> 50:55.288
- Get me a mirror.
- You don't need no mirror. Not now.

50:58.489 --> 51:02.865
- Send him to his grave!
- Put him in the hospital, King!

51:09.133 --> 51:10.634
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.135
Are you okay?

51:12.136 --> 51:15.545
- I couldn't...
- It's okay, I'm a doctor.

51:20.011 --> 51:21.713
How far?

51:24.048 --> 51:25.283
Fourth month.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.350
Okay. We should get
you out of here.

51:27.351 --> 51:30.720
We need to get you in an ambulance.
Come on. Come with me.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.025
It's okay. Come on.

51:36.127 --> 51:39.740
Hey. That old man is messing
you up pretty good.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.902
You gonna let him
get away with that?

51:44.502 --> 51:48.672
What you smiling about?
You got nothing to smile about.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.375
I never liked being pretty.

51:51.042 --> 51:52.585
You ain't pretty no more.

51:53.211 --> 51:55.278
Best not to take any chances.

51:55.279 --> 51:57.647
King Soloman's my baby's daddy.

51:57.648 --> 52:00.484
- The young guy fighting?
- Yeah.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.219
We just got married.

52:02.220 --> 52:05.655
I don't have a ring yet, but he
says he's gonna get me a nice one

52:05.656 --> 52:08.124
- after he wins the fight.
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.094
Why are you here?

52:11.095 --> 52:13.630
Sailor O'Connor, the guy
your husband's fighting.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.466
- The old guy.
- Yeah. What's your name?

52:16.467 --> 52:19.169
- Peg.
- Peg, I'm Diane.

52:19.170 --> 52:23.113
Mm. You got kids with Sailor?

52:23.741 --> 52:27.548
They are going crazy
with the presents.

52:27.912 --> 52:31.525
<i>No. Not with Sailor.</i>

52:39.524 --> 52:42.392
- Are you the lady that phoned 911?
- Yes.

52:42.393 --> 52:44.594
- What's the problem?
- Preterm contractions.

52:44.595 --> 52:47.531
She's in her second trimester.
Do you have a heart monitor?

52:47.532 --> 52:50.367
- Are you a doctor? Okay.
- Yes.

52:50.368 --> 52:53.203
You don't need to do this, okay?
There's no need to go on.

52:53.204 --> 52:56.248
We can end this with dignity.
You understand? With dignity.

52:57.108 --> 52:58.308
Look.

52:58.309 --> 53:02.012
<i>Come on, Sailor, come on!
Fight back! Come on! Fight back,</i>

53:02.013 --> 53:04.147
you little wuss. Come on!

53:04.148 --> 53:06.487
Come on, come on! Fight back!

53:06.918 --> 53:08.722
Get up, Sailor.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.455
Get up, you little wuss, get up!

53:12.456 --> 53:14.057
Get up.

53:14.058 --> 53:16.259
Get up!

53:16.260 --> 53:17.962
Get up!

53:19.463 --> 53:22.065
You don't need to do this.
There's no need to go on.

53:22.066 --> 53:25.468
You done yourself real good. You should
be proud. You made me damn proud.

53:25.469 --> 53:27.037
You're doing great.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.172
There's no shame in
throwing in the towel.

53:29.173 --> 53:32.075
You still got the record.
You still haven't gone down.

53:32.076 --> 53:35.314
- We can... I don't wanna do this.
- We can do this, Mike.

53:36.247 --> 53:38.815
What for? You still got...
You haven't gone down yet.

53:38.816 --> 53:40.917
- I ain't going down, Mike.
- Well, if you go down,

53:40.918 --> 53:42.586
you might not get up, okay?

53:42.587 --> 53:44.921
And if you go down,
I think I'll kick your ass.

53:44.922 --> 53:46.389
- All right.
- All right.

53:46.390 --> 53:47.724
I love you, Mike.

53:47.725 --> 53:50.594
- I'm telling you, the last one...
- Mike. I love you, Mike.

53:50.595 --> 53:52.035
I love you too.

53:58.102 --> 53:59.342
Okay, tough guy.

54:07.745 --> 54:11.392
Normal sinus rhythm,
hemodynamically stable.

54:12.516 --> 54:15.652
Peg, if this were me,

54:15.653 --> 54:19.489
I would go to the hospital just
for some extra testing, okay?

54:19.490 --> 54:22.933
I'm okay. Really, I'm...

54:25.997 --> 54:28.837
I gotta see the end of the fight.

54:30.134 --> 54:32.712
I must say, Rose,

54:32.970 --> 54:34.871
I'm a tad uncomfortable.

54:34.872 --> 54:39.643
What? Sitting in the home of a
woman who despises your God?

54:39.644 --> 54:41.380
I have a crucifix up my arse.

54:42.546 --> 54:46.455
Those were the conditions under
which you agreed to meet me, hm?

54:46.617 --> 54:48.551
You know, a man in your profession

54:48.552 --> 54:51.756
shouldn't joke about having
something up your butt.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.858
Sorry. Quite right.

54:54.859 --> 54:56.697
Do you know the old limerick?

54:57.395 --> 54:59.729
Which limerick would that be?

54:59.730 --> 55:03.500
<i>The altar boy, the altar boy
The dirty little beast</i>

55:03.501 --> 55:07.205
<i>He filled his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the priest</i>

55:09.774 --> 55:14.411
That's a sad commentary on what's
befallen the most noble calling.

55:14.412 --> 55:16.012
How do you handle such things?

55:16.013 --> 55:17.480
Such things?

55:17.481 --> 55:21.384
Well, the spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.

55:21.385 --> 55:25.855
You know, a priest once told me, he
tied his hands up with his rosary

55:25.856 --> 55:28.091
every night before he went to bed

55:28.092 --> 55:30.397
so he couldn't masturbate
while sleeping.

55:31.429 --> 55:34.109
And why did he tell you that?

55:34.965 --> 55:36.700
I was a young girl at the time.

55:36.701 --> 55:41.071
- I cut a bit of a skirt, I did in my day.
- No doubt.

55:41.072 --> 55:44.107
I think he wanted to get
up under that skirt.

55:44.108 --> 55:47.544
Just wanted to talk sexy
and try and get me going.

55:47.545 --> 55:49.088
Ah.

55:50.881 --> 55:56.186
Tell me, you're a relatively
young, seemingly virile man,

55:56.187 --> 55:59.889
who I'm assuming has all
parts yet fully functioning.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.758
Yes, as far as I know.

56:01.759 --> 56:03.526
Oh, mores the pity, then.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.162
Rose, I'm just a little
embarrassed here.

56:06.163 --> 56:08.934
- I'm not here to talk about my sex life.
- Ha.

56:08.966 --> 56:11.578
Well, here's hoping there's
something to talk about.

56:12.903 --> 56:14.480
Rose,

56:14.839 --> 56:16.039
um, Sailor's

56:16.040 --> 56:17.685
quite concerned about you.

56:18.275 --> 56:20.844
Sailor should be
concerned about himself.

56:20.845 --> 56:23.113
You know what he's gone
and done, don't you?

56:23.114 --> 56:25.048
You're talking about the fight.

56:25.049 --> 56:27.384
- Is that what you're calling it?
- What are you calling it?

56:27.385 --> 56:30.520
- My son is an old man.
- No, he's not that old.

56:30.521 --> 56:33.957
- He's...
- No. He's old and you know it.

56:33.958 --> 56:35.525
This won't be a fight.

56:35.526 --> 56:38.828
Sure, it will be. He's very
tough, he's in terrific shape.

56:38.829 --> 56:40.764
You know why he's
taking it, don't you?

56:40.765 --> 56:46.313
Yes. He wants to take you to
Ireland. One more visit for you.

56:47.338 --> 56:51.816
That's not it. He may think
that's it, but it's not.

56:52.443 --> 56:54.122
What do you think the reason is?

56:54.945 --> 56:56.556
Guilt.

56:58.783 --> 57:00.326
Guilt?

57:01.118 --> 57:02.490
About...?

57:03.154 --> 57:05.391
Being alive.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.782
Come on, King!

57:29.647 --> 57:31.793
Finish him off, King!

57:33.684 --> 57:35.488
Rock the body!

57:38.989 --> 57:40.356
You can do it!

57:40.357 --> 57:43.197
Take the old man out, King!

57:51.902 --> 57:54.082
Break it up, guys.
Break it up. Let's go.

57:55.806 --> 57:59.351
- Send him to his grave!
- Put him in the hospital, King!

58:05.649 --> 58:07.294
<i>How much?</i>

58:08.586 --> 58:13.929
How much wrong can a
person do before...?

58:15.826 --> 58:20.338
Before they've used up
whatever good is inside them?

58:25.769 --> 58:27.812
I mean...

58:29.406 --> 58:31.279
What I did...

58:36.413 --> 58:38.058
Diane...

58:39.016 --> 58:40.251
God...

58:41.385 --> 58:43.720
can be far worse than us.

58:43.721 --> 58:49.166
He can do more damage, cause
more pain and suffering,

58:49.460 --> 58:52.795
provide us with more temptation
than anything in the universe

58:52.796 --> 58:56.299
and yet, we sin,

58:56.300 --> 58:58.104
and he doesn't.

58:59.103 --> 59:01.749
I'm not quite sure how that works.

59:10.447 --> 59:12.718
I have nothing.

59:18.455 --> 59:21.033
How do I go on?

59:22.526 --> 59:25.400
You need to learn to surrender.

59:29.466 --> 59:32.078
You got him, King! Take him down!

59:37.441 --> 59:40.577
- Jab. Jab him!
- Break it up!

59:40.578 --> 59:42.312
Break it up, guys. Break it up.

59:42.313 --> 59:44.033
You got him, Sailor. He's tired!

59:44.281 --> 59:48.685
Sailor. Sailor, this boxing
is a younger man's sport,

59:48.686 --> 59:52.021
always has been, and you're not
as young as you used to be.

59:52.022 --> 59:54.190
Now, you're strong as a bull,

59:54.191 --> 59:55.592
but if you're taking this

59:55.593 --> 59:57.827
fight to make the money

59:57.828 --> 01:00:01.305
to take Rose to Ireland,
there are other ways.

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.032
Bake sales.

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:06.369
Yo, old-timer! Hey!

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.550
You know who I am?

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.875
I'm the man who's gonna
knock you the fuck out.

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:14.919
That's who I am.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:22.292
Yeah. I know who you are.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:26.456
I hope you punish me.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.659
I hope you knock me
down, I really do.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.227
And I hope you

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.601
knock some sense into this old man.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.204
That would be my wish.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.209
Let me ask you something.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.640
Do you have kids?

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.219
- No, you're too young.
- I have one on the way.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:51.255
That's a beautiful thing.
It really is. Right, Sean?

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:53.386
Yes, it is.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.522
You know,

01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:00.765
I held my son as he
took his final breath.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.598
I didn't have an answer for him.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:12.235
I will do my best, as will you.
Now, get the fuck out of here.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:25.088
No, stop!

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:43.006
You okay?

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:51.851
How long?

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.426
Five years,

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.497
11 months,

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:11.933
27 days.

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:20.381
So...

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.983
how did you come to this?

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:26.850
Bad relationship?

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:33.188
Did anyone tell you about the
three rings of a relationship?

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:39.358
Engagement ring, a wedding
ring and the suffering.

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:43.337
Sorry.

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:46.408
Bad joke.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:03:00.281
It's what I did.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.492
What you did?

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:16.333
What we do is never really done.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:23.376
What you got in that glass,

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.810
it won't help.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:28.441
It's not the answer.

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.450
You know that.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.082
Because we all been there.

01:03:57.935 --> 01:03:59.876
Thank you.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.145
I, uh...

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.148
I need to talk to you.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.364
Talk to him.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.097
Sailor, I...

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:03.710
- I came here because...
- Diane.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:07.181
You were deceitful...

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:12.011
without the slightest
consideration.

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:15.750
A mother.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.290
A monster.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:27.367
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.480
You knew you were sick.

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.041
Why didn't you seek help?

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:50.086
Help was around you every day.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.525
Why?

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:55.585
Why didn't you seek help?

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:11.909
And now that you're better,
you want my forgiveness.

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.416
No.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.781
Diane, Diane.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.754
Please, get out of here.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:08.259
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make up for what I did,

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.006
for the pain I caused you.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.768
Caused my family.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:20.079
I see the hate in your eyes.

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.215
I deserve it.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:28.044
You don't. With each
breath I take, I...

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.657
I hate myself enough
for the both of us.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.299
I'm not...

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:43.299
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:48.671
Contrary to the teachings
of your faith, there...

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:54.212
There are things that
are unforgivable.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:01.654
But I will not have
you consumed by hate.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:07.383
So you... You pray to your God

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:12.533
for your loss, for your salvation,

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:15.131
and for theirs.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.567
You ask him to help you find
a way out of your hate.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:29.674
But don't you ever pray for me.

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:34.546
I don't deserve it.

01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:52.669
Come on, son. You're gonna be late.

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:59.033
- Use your jab. Use your jab.
- Break that glass jaw, Sailor.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:01.715
Take the old man out, King!

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.240
Kill him, Sailor!

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:06.113
Don't box if you can't
win a boxing match!

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:21.122
Pauly. Come on.
We're gonna be late.

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:23.064
What you got there?

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:25.861
How about some ice
cream after church?

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:28.063
Rinse that mug. Rinse it good.

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:31.268
Sailor, look at me. You okay?

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.615
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:43.046
How are you enjoying
the fight tonight?

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:49.629
Well, I think these boys have
suffered enough, don't you?

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:57.893
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna offer them a new prize.

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:01.030
- Twelve grand to the loser.
- Boo!

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:04.166
Two grand more than
the winner's purse.

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.108
What do you say?

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.971
What do you say, Sailor?

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.706
Hey, get him out of the ring!

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.541
Get that piece of
shit out of there!

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.245
That's the biggest
purse of your life.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:19.114
All you gotta do is lie down,
and the money's yours.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:21.050
Get out of the ring.
Get out of here.

01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:23.619
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
What's wrong with you?

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.787
No! Oh,

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.865
my gosh!

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.467
What about you, King?

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:35.835
I hear you got a baby coming soon.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.340
All you gotta do is just lie down.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.175
Yeah.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:45.241
Now I know you are a loser.

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.577
- Twelve thousand dollars to the loser.
- Hey, hey.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.315
Don't do this, Eddie.
Don't do this.

01:10:51.448 --> 01:10:55.417
Do not do this. Yeah, you wanna
mess up the kid's career, huh?

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.120
You're jealous because
you lost the purse.

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:00.022
You lost him. You'll
never get him back.

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:03.292
- Twelve thousand to your loser!
- Get him out of here!

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:06.372
Get him out of my face!
You're a piece of shit!

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:11.033
I'm done with you all!
I'm out of here.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:12.838
Let's pray.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.439
Father in heaven, please protect
Brother Sailor tonight.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.641
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:22.911
Amen. And protect Brother
King tonight, as well.

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.147
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.231
Hold on for a second.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.511
Hey.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.845
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:55.285
We're a family.

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:19.268
You go, baby boy.

01:12:19.269 --> 01:12:21.471
You got this fight. You've won it.

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:25.341
You've won the fight, man.
Don't do anything stupid.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.613
Gotta knock him down.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:31.559
All right. If you want
to knock him down,

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.083
you work on his body.

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:37.386
God knows what his head is made
of, but it sure ain't skin and bone.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.587
Gotta knock him down.

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.357
You kill the body
and the head dies.

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:44.732
You hear me? Kill the body
and the head will die.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.138
All right.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.301
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.152
It's time, kid.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:13.031
Hey, hey.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.671
I want you to know that I'm proud
of what you've become, boy.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:20.769
Okay, let's go, guys.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.410
Sailor.

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:26.880
That's enough, bud. That's
enough, that's enough.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.321
You're getting schooled, Sailor!

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:47.833
Get outside that left foot!
Outside the left foot!

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:50.166
Put him in the hospital, King!

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:53.997
Put him down!

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:59.578
Break it up, guys. Come on.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.420
- Hey!
- Sailor, I'm sorry.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:46.850
- I'm sorry.
- Back to your corner, let's go.

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:54.690
Hey, you okay?

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:55.958
I shat myself.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.264
All right, Sailor,
stay standing. I got it.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:01.108
Hey, hey, clean towels, now.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.478
Hey, look. He lost his mud.

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:06.607
The Sailor lost his mud, man.

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.604
The Sailor's gonna go down.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:11.473
For the first time in history,
that Sailor's gonna go down.

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:14.343
Now is your shot, man.
Now is your shot.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:17.112
You go get him. Get on him.

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:20.317
- This is your shot. For life.
- Shut up!

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.891
You're doing good, buddy.
It's all over, okay?

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:30.359
- One more.
- It's all over.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.427
- One more round.
- Your kidneys are gone.

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:35.998
What is the matter with you? What
are you, nuts? What's the point?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.634
You couldn't beat this guy
with a baseball bat, okay?

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:40.969
You got another L in
the column. Big deal.

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:44.439
You're still standing, right? You
never been down. What is the point?

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.780
I swore on my ma's head I
would never quit, Mikey.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:52.114
- I promised.
- You're good to go, Sailor.

01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:54.116
We'll let the doc decide. You sit.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.923
Hey, Gordy, you bring
the doc, please?

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.058
Look at me.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.863
Sailor.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:10.670
- Sailor, look at me. You okay?
- I'm good, doc.

01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:14.002
You're taking too many
shots. I'm gonna stop it.

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:16.638
One more round, doc,
please. One more round.

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:19.115
Albright, what do you think?

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:22.216
I got no opinion.

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.785
Last round, doc,
last round, please.

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.796
I hope I don't hate
myself later for this.

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:32.190
- You won't.
- Ref, watch him close.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.595
- Knock him on his butt!
- Shut up!

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.463
- You gonna be famous, man.
- Shut up!

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.832
- What do you mean, shut up?
- Shut up!

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:46.668
This is your turn, man.
I don't care what you say,

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:50.783
you get your butt up there
and put the Sailor down!

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:55.321
All right, Sailor. All right.

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:23.843
I'm gonna be okay, Mike.

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.015
I promise.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:31.182
I promise. I love you.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:36.585
Last round! Last round.

01:17:36.586 --> 01:17:38.020
- Come on.
- Come on, guys.

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:40.929
- Seconds out.
- Let's go home!

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:47.134
Get outside that left foot.

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:51.700
Use your jab, use your jab!

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:53.869
Last round, guys, let's go. Box!

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.516
Come on, old man!

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.741
One punch, Sailor!
Come on, bud, one punch!

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:01.977
Quick on your feet, Sailor!

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:05.318
Stay on his right shoulder!
Stay on his right shoulder!

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:08.720
You're getting schooled, Sailor!

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.423
Break it up.

01:18:14.424 --> 01:18:16.626
Break it up, boy! Break it up!

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.945
- Double that up, baby.
- Get away from him.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.893
Sailor, grab him! Grab him!

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:33.304
Give me the towel.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.648
Put him down! Put him down!

01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:40.443
Oh!

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:45.553
Do it, kid. Do it.

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:51.292
Oh!

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:02.036
Okay, let's go.

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:11.884
Take the old man out, King!

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:13.619
Let him go, King.

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:16.579
Let him go, man.

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:20.185
Ref, leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:23.752
- I got you.
- He's taking him to the bell.

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:25.091
We got this.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:27.899
Let him go. Drop him.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.912
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:53.719
<i>It's a unanimous decision.</i>

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:57.728
The winner is King Soloman!

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:16.179
I'm proud of you. Good fight.

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.352
You're a good kid.

01:21:29.819 --> 01:21:32.621
You know what? You're the
toughest son of a bitch I know.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:33.822
Thank you.

01:21:33.823 --> 01:21:36.867
Yeah, you're also the dumbest
son of a bitch I know.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.144
Go see your girl.

01:21:57.747 --> 01:21:59.756
I love you.

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:43.464
The...

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.038
The best we can do...
