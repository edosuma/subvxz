WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:02.999
CARTER: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.295 --> 00:04.876
Because of his autism,
Kevin is usually

00:05.005 --> 00:06.996
more comfortable with
technology than people.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.759
Marry me, JoJo.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.674
I don't know
what to say.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.593
TESS: I don't
have you here.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.804
| just don't know
if I can do it anymore.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.673
Bye, Jack.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.768
FARGO: I'm pretty sure
we're in 1947.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.357
You're all from 2010?

00:24.483 --> 00:26.269
From the Eureka that
you helped create.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.141
Now, we need your help
to get us back.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.978
Just for luck.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.326
FARGO: Thanks for
getting us home, Henry.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.787
And somehow everything
is just the same.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.668
FARGO: Isn't that supposed
to be made of granite?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.546
If that's different,
other stuff could be,
too, right?

00:50.008 --> 00:53.125
Me marry you?
In what universe?

00:54.930 --> 00:57.262
Kevin, honey?
Where are you?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.260
Relax, Mom,
I'm right here.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.310
Nice hat!
I'll be home before dinner.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.471
Thanks, Mom. Love you.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.740
SARAH, are you there?

01:20.998 --> 01:22.283
SARAH: Yes, Sheriff.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.998
SARAH, is Zoe
still at Harvard?

01:25.377 --> 01:28.119
Of course she is, Jack.
Where else would she be?

01:29.381 --> 01:31.918
Look at you, handsome.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.006
I thought
you'd never get home.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.977
Yeah, me neither.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.514
(STAMMERS)
You're not in Australia.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.268
I mean, uh, for example.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.976
Um, yeah.
That would be true.
(CHUCKLES)

01:52.988 --> 01:55.525
SARAH, can you
get Jack some lunch?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.864
I think his brain is hungry.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.154
SARAH: Bacon cheeseburger
with extra bacon,
coming right up.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.824
Okay, well, enjoy.
I've got to go.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.530
Wish me luck.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.870
Testing day?

02:08.003 --> 02:11.040
We're pulling Tiny
out of Section Five.
Taking her through her paces?

02:11.173 --> 02:14.131
Yeah. Uh, Tiny. Yes.
Good luck.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.545
Thanks.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.966
Jack, is this...
Is this about the thing?

02:20.932 --> 02:23.469
Because if it is
about the thing,

02:23.852 --> 02:26.093
then I just need
more time to think.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.686
Sure. Yeah, I get that.
That's the thing.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.980
SARAH: Sheriff,
Kevin's at the door.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.693
Why are parents
so fricking lame?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.194
Holy smokes.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.158
Give her a break, Kev.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.323
Kevin?
Uh, Jack?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.988
lgnore him.
He hasn't had his lunch.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.995
| smell bacon. Sweet.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.792
That's Kevin.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.799
So, get this.
Mom was late this morning,

02:54.925 --> 02:55.914
and I didn't get to
make it to Dre's.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.633
And I mean,
she's always on me
about being late.

02:58.762 --> 03:02.675
Maybe now she'll realize
that time is a relativistic
construct and ease up.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.048
Yeah. lwouldn't
count on it.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.720
But, listen. I'm going
home before work.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.932
So, I could take you
into town.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.802
Cool. Thanks.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.973
Later, Jack.
Yeah.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.984
Have...

03:17.322 --> 03:18.732
Have a good day.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.825
Hey, dungeon master.
When am | getting
out of here?

03:25.706 --> 03:28.664
I don't know.
What did you do?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.622
Nothing. You just like
throwing me in jail.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.872
So, I unlocked
a few cages.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.874
Those monkeys
deserved some freedom.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.669
Lupo, be a human.
I've got a date.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.756
A date.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.549
With who?

03:47.686 --> 03:50.393
You know,
the blonde chick with the
PhD in Reproductive Biology.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.554
Yeah, we're going to
play doctorate.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.984
Get out.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.603
You going to tase me
in the ass again?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.105
Just get out.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.450
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
CARTER: Allison?

04:14.629 --> 04:16.244
I'm here, Carter.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.043
You okay?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.677
Well, I came in.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.600
And Jenna was
with the nanny.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.016
And Kevin...

04:35.984 --> 04:37.815
Yeah. I know.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.935
He came by my place.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.979
He's different.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.985
He stole my bacon.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.863
I didn't believe it.
I mean, he came in,

04:47.996 --> 04:50.408
he talked to me,
he looked at me...

04:50.832 --> 04:52.242
We've changed him somehow.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.290
That's not the only thing.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.786
Um, when I got back...

05:00.175 --> 05:03.087
Tess was at my place.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.129
She never moved away.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.224
And from what I can tell
we're still together.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.847
Oh.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.098
Well, that's good.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.600
I'm happy for you.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.194
It's something.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.072
CARTER: | feel like
I'm being a jerk to Allison.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.446
Like a liar, not at least
trying to explain to Tess...

05:32.582 --> 05:33.833
No. You did
the right thing.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.824
Talking about
an alternate timeline

05:35.961 --> 05:37.576
could have
unforeseen repercussions.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.997
What, besides everybody
thinking we're nuts?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.836
And please
tell me this thing
is out of batteries.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.333
Well, it still could have
enough residual antibaryons
to open a wormhole.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.960
You know, Allison should
get this taken to G.D.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.759
Yeah. She's on it.
She's also really focused
on Kevin.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.882
I mean, how could he
just change?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.760
The perceived present
is built on events
of the past.

05:54.896 --> 05:55.851
Yeah. Yeah. Whoa, sorry.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.972
But, uh, Kevin
isn't an event.
He's a person.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.848
And now,
he's a completely
different person.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.941
The causes of autism
are not clear.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.732
They seem to
require a series of

06:04.865 --> 06:07.823
genetic and environmental
dominoes to fall.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.027
So, Henry, do you think
it's possible that he
did it on purpose?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.243
That he targeted
the five of us?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.830
He messes with
the machine to send us back
so that he would change.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.450
We're talking about
decades of history here.

06:19.087 --> 06:23.126
The calculations of
probability and outcome
are infinitely complex.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.715
Yeah. We're also talking
about scary-smart Kevin.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.175
But not this Kevin.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.842
And that machine
was not altered to
target specific people.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.340
And this Kevin did not
send us back in time.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.312
Okay.
So, his intentions...

06:36.438 --> 06:38.975
Are locked in a boy whose

06:39.107 --> 06:42.144
consciousness of that event
no longer exists.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.519
Hi, Carter.
Hey, sweetie.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.644
Hi.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.396
All right.
You should get up there.
It's almost time.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.527
For?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.408
(CHUCKLES) Shut up.

06:52.954 --> 06:53.818
(BOTH LAUGHING)

06:53.955 --> 06:56.367
Giving speeches is his
favorite part of being mayor.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.830
He complains,
but he loves it.

06:57.959 --> 06:58.869
Ha.
Yeah.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.334
A speech for Founders' Day.
I'll be right over.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.289
She's on the committee.
Yes. Grace.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.499
And I'm pretty sure
I'm married to her.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.964
Oh, dear.
Oh, yes.

07:11.973 --> 07:15.181
Hello, and welcome
to Founders' Day.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.931
It's a good thing
to get together

07:19.064 --> 07:22.898
and realize that the past
is still very much with us.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.311
Especially here.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.059
So, Zane unproposed?

07:26.196 --> 07:28.312
I thought proposals
were a no backsies
kind of deal.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.439
No, he didn't take it back.
He never asked me.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.816
You see,
we never even dated.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.817
So, how's your day going?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.036
Oh, swell.
Remember Julia,
my sort of girlfriend?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.700
Sure.
Yeah, we never met.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.661
She works for Google.
She's, like, a gazillionaire.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.204
And she's married
to an astronaut.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.497
I'm sorry.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.745
An astronaut.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.087
And other than
that cheery chestnut,

07:46.216 --> 07:49.049
I seem to be living
my same old life. Alone.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.843
This reality blows.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.303
Amen, sister.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.846
What's this on your face?
Mom, quit it.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.843
Nope.
Not going to quit it.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.767
I'm going to go get a burger.
Try and survive without me.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.985
Amazing, isn't it?

08:07.112 --> 08:08.898
Good-looking boy
you've got there.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.238
Love what you've done
with the place.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.067
You did all this
to make me feel at home?
I don't know what to say.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.829
Oh, my God.
You could say that, yeah.

08:16.955 --> 08:17.944
You're not supposed
to be here.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.821
l was thinking
the same thing.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.914
Although the problem
isn't the here,
it's the now.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.375
This doohickey worked.
Can you believe it?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.415
It's one of Henry's markers.
Made from your phone.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.584
Yeah,
when we switched jackets.
It was in my pocket.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.332
Please.
Don't blame yourself.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.254
lwasn't planning to.
Okay. Carter.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.424
Dr. Grant, I know this
must be oven/vhelming for you.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.219
We know what it feels like
to be pulled away from
our own time.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.967
Thank you. It's fine here.
| just expected...

08:41.855 --> 08:44.938
I thought there would be
more flying cars,
robotic servants,

08:45.066 --> 08:47.682
superhighways
stretching into the sky.

08:47.819 --> 08:51.937
Less '47 Chrysler New Yorkers.
But, you know...

08:52.657 --> 08:53.772
Well,
sorry to disappoint you.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.320
But I promise you
we will get you
back where you belong.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.776
Lickety-split.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.494
Thank you.
Until then, Dr. Blake.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.493
Would you care
for some cotton candy?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.827
No, no, no.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.200
You can't walk around
looking at everything

09:05.336 --> 09:07.247
that's been invented
since the telephone.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.961
Which was invented
in 1876.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.170
Stay.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.882
Thank you, no.
I've got a whole new world
to explore. Be seeing you.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.970
Dr. Grant, please.
Just while we talk over
the situation.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.884
All right. For you.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.682
Thank you.
I'll be back.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.354
Henry.
Hey.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.939
Can I borrow you
for a second?
Sure.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.195
Look.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.441
Oh, my God.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.564
He had this.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.616
(STUTTERS)

09:38.870 --> 09:40.110
That guy's bad news,

09:40.246 --> 09:42.988
and we got to get him back
where he belongs and fix this.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.661
What?
There's nothing to fix.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.127
Allison, our time journey
could have had a huge impact.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.995
We don't know
if man walked on the moon.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.463
We could have
changed anything.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.960
Yeah, we changed Kevin.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.425
I know.
We know.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.089
I'm not gonna
lose him again.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.008
We have to examine
the bridge device.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.426
It could be
supporting an unstable
temporal wormhole.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.175
Space-time could unravel.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.970
Unraveling space-time
is bad.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.026
l'll arrange the transport.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.823
Things have really
changed around here.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.110
Eureka is a new town.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.999
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

10:40.598 --> 10:41.804
Let's go.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.800
Everybody go! G0!
Off! Off the street!

10:44.936 --> 10:46.517
Go! G0! Off!

10:49.899 --> 10:53.892
. Tiny!
Trny, stop! Stop!

10:54.487 --> 10:57.729
Stop! Tiny!
Bad robot!

10:58.116 --> 11:01.074
Bad! Bad! Stop!

11:01.911 --> 11:03.742
The more things change...

11:03.872 --> 11:05.328
The more
they stay the same.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.957
Mmm-hmm.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.216
Another day,
another runaway robot.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.431
Anyone hurt?
Not yet.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.926
l have been working on
that probe for 10 months!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.730
If you need a probe, Red...
You know what...

11:29.856 --> 11:31.642
You, go. Do it.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.484
You really think someone
messed with your giant bug?

11:40.617 --> 11:43.825
Tiny was built
to sample atmospheric
electricity on Titan.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.033
Her power cell was hardened.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.028
There was no way
it would just short out.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.952
Any particular reason
you think it was Zane?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.166
Because he's a jackass.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.876
That's why I kicked him
off my design team, Jack.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.836
He's in yourjail so much
he has his own pillow.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.923
Okay. Tess, if you want
to fix the remote,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.091
|wi|| find Tiny.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.586
Thank you, love.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.265
That looked...

12:08.937 --> 12:10.222
Intimate.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.937
This is one of the
weirder days ever.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.810
What's the story
on the time machine?

12:14.943 --> 12:16.683
Well, it's not a time
machine precisely.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.902
I mean, it connects
two timelines.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.814
Allison's moving it
to G.D. to see if it has
enough residual power

12:22.951 --> 12:24.816
in order to open up
a new wormhole.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.160
Great. And send
Dr. Charming home.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.368
And as for our hitchhiker,

12:30.500 --> 12:34.960
I designed these markers
to detect our temporal
anomalies.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.503
In order
to transport Dr. Grant,

12:37.632 --> 12:41.124
it would have had to have
been retuned manually.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.763
Listen to me.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.804
l'm responsible for the
greatest scientific experiment
known to mankind,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.723
and this is the way
you're treating me?

12:52.981 --> 12:54.812
It's a crying shame, Jack.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.806
Well, I know, and, l...

12:56.943 --> 12:58.979
Oh, you know what else
is a crying shame?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.649
ls you trying
to strand me in 1947!

13:01.948 --> 13:02.858
Where'd you get that idea?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.606
Oh, you tweaked my marker
so it worked for you,

13:04.742 --> 13:06.607
and you risked my life
to do it.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.534
You just wanted
to see the future.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.536
And what a disappointment
it is.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.916
Where a visitor's treated
with cruel suspicion
and accusations.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.456
Future's come a long way.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.874
Yeah, well, my cell,
my time, my rules.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.464
Get comfy.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.925
Oh, dear.
Look at this.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.555
You know what this means?

13:26.681 --> 13:27.796
l'm fat.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.516
In this timeline,
I am the fat deputy.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.096
Oh, no, ma'am.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.934
Sheriff Andy.
Sheriff Andy?

13:37.442 --> 13:38.898
Well, I appreciate
the promotion, boss,

13:39.027 --> 13:40.938
but I'm still
just your deputy.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.811
A robot deputy.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.609
This thing's
really a machine?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.319
Yeah.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.158
I prefer
synthetic colleague.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.278
That's a bit more like
the future I envisioned.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.155
Miss Lupo, why are you
wearing my spare uniform?

13:54.459 --> 13:56.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.046
No fiance’ and no job.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.912
Good to be home.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.922
Come closer, robot man.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.721
You're extremely lifelike.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.934
I'd love to get a look
under your uniform.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.895
Boss?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.145
Tiny gives off
an alpha-ray signature,

14:26.282 --> 14:29.490
but it's very difficult to
follow in this environment.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.945
Yeah, but I think
we're on the right track.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.624
Andy, mind if I test your
memory circuits a little?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.216
Little game
to pass the time?

14:47.345 --> 14:48.380
Sure.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.346
Yes, how long have you and I
been working together?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.598
312 days, 16 hours.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.429
And Lupo left
when you got here?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.053
Miss Lupo wasn't too happy
she didn't get
promoted to sheriff.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.680
Yeah, I...

15:00.817 --> 15:01.806
I'm really
enjoying this game.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.479
Can we do
movie trivia next?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.943
Sure.
Yeah, let's do history.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.274
When did man first
walk on the Moon?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.774
Neil Armstrong,
July 20th, 1969.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.910
And when did the
designated hitter rule
come in and ruin baseball?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.700
Oh, 1973,

15:16.916 --> 15:21.250
but the DH rule
actually extended the careers
of many stars of the game.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.582
Sheriff, do you mind if!
shoot a question your way?

15:23.714 --> 15:24.749
Yeah, sure.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.793
Did you happen
to go back to 1947,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.507
come back to an
altered timeline?

15:30.179 --> 15:33.512
That seems
a bit of a stretch.
Why would you ask?

15:33.641 --> 15:34.801
Well, the questions
lead me to think

15:34.934 --> 15:36.845
that you're trying to see
if history is still the same.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.010
That, and the pollen
in your hair has

15:39.147 --> 15:41.183
pollution consistent
with the late 1940s.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.225
And our prisoner
matches a Dr. Grant
that disappeared in 1947

15:45.403 --> 15:47.985
with five other
unidentified suspects.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.729
I connected the dots.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.106
Nice connecting.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.649
Thanks, boss.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.161
(MECHANICAL HUMMING)

15:56.831 --> 15:58.867
Well,
what do we have here?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.663
Did somebody take a tumble?

16:12.805 --> 16:13.794
Morning, Chief.

16:13.931 --> 16:14.920
Hi.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.807
Find an empty lab in
Section Five for the device,

16:17.935 --> 16:20.017
something off of
corridor D that's quiet.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.352
Got it.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.346
When did they
start calling me "chief"?

16:28.029 --> 16:30.736
Good Lord.
This is my office?

16:32.909 --> 16:35.696
Well, apparently,
in this timeline,
l have no taste.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.864
Are you kidding?
This is wicked.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.908
It's, like,
my dream office.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.872
Oh, no!

16:46.088 --> 16:48.921
Fargo, they weren't
calling me chief.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.801
Fargo, this is your office.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.176
I'm running G.D.?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.804
Tiny's on her way to G.D.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.024
I'm just heading
back out to the scene to
finish my incident report.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.608
Papen/vork, huh?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.147
Big whoop, tin man.

17:12.782 --> 17:16.741
I imagine
going back to the past
put you in a sour mood.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.777
Carter told you?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.154
Well,
he confirmed a hunch.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.039
Don't worry.
I know it's all
on the down low.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.917
I thought
you'd be out and about,
seeing what's changed.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.832
l have no man
and no job.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.921
That's enough change
for one day.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.211
No job? (CHUCKLES)

17:38.057 --> 17:39.137
Afternoon.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.927
Hey.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.142
You tell what happened
to it, yet?

17:43.271 --> 17:45.808
No, still untangling
her electrical system.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.431
Hey, you want to hold
Zane down while I beat
the crap out of him,

17:48.568 --> 17:49.808
or you want
to take turns?

17:49.944 --> 17:51.354
Well, we should
probably take turns,

17:51.487 --> 17:54.069
but, usually prefer
to have evidence.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.779
Killjoy.
Yeah.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.445
Listen, thank you
for finding Tiny for me.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.658
You're welcome.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.903
You're always there
when I need you.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.413
Listen, Jack.

18:04.542 --> 18:08.000
I've been thinking about
the, you know, the thing.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.749
And, my answer is yes.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.253
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely, yes.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.602
Aren't you happy?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.892
Oh, you know...
(LAUGHING)

18:26.188 --> 18:27.223
Yes, I'm happy.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.438
I mean, you look
a little shocked.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.727
Well, I'm a little...

18:30.860 --> 18:31.895
(SCREAMS)

18:36.365 --> 18:37.775
Medic!

18:47.585 --> 18:48.574
What happened?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.497
Some kind of
electrical shock.
Don't you love his hair?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.621
It's so fluffy.
Fluffy.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.293
Fluffy's a funny word.
Fluffy.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.461
She's a little out of it.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.380
All right,
well, let's get her
into the infirmary.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.173
Okay.
Did you see...

19:00.306 --> 19:01.796
Did you see
the big, red elf?

19:01.932 --> 19:03.888
Yes. Yes, we did.
He's an awesome red elf.
It was so pretty.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.599
It was a big, red elf.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.267
Nurse, this woman
needs a neuro exam.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.772
Where's the doctor in charge?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.729
That's you, Dr. Blake.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.477
Oh, okay.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.191
So, well, then give me
a EEG, lights,

19:14.320 --> 19:15.856
and set up
for a portable MRI.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.068
Right away.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.779
Don't ask me.

19:19.909 --> 19:20.898
Never gonna be able
to keep this straight.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.195
ls Elvis gonna walk
through the door?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.785
That would be so cool.
We could show him
the big red elf.

19:24.914 --> 19:25.824
Yes, we could.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.789
You know, Allison's gonna
take care of you, okay?
You understand?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.499
I love you.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.255
Fluffy.

19:37.927 --> 19:38.916
Jack.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.796
Hey, Fargo.
Got a minute?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.471
But I can squeeze you in
for next Tuesday.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.015
Larry, I always have time
for Sheriff Carter.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.649
Heard about the promotion.

19:55.778 --> 19:56.767
Isn't it awesome?

19:56.904 --> 19:58.405
Larry has to do
everything I say.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.359
Larry, one foot. Now.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.909
Look, we got problems.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.576
Tess' bug blew again,
and this time she got hurt.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.459
Send a basket of
mini muffins to Dr. Fontana.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.786
Send a team to find out
exactly what happened.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.254
My day is just packed.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.505
Fargo, send a team.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.966
Larry, clear my afternoon.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.388
You got it, Chief.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.847
Hey, where's Zane?
I need to talk to him.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.718
I don't know.
But I'm looking through
his personnel file,

20:29.854 --> 20:31.765
and he gets in trouble
for stupid stuff.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.933
Pranks, nothing serious.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.058
Where'd you get
his G.D. file?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.819
You're looking at the
head of G.D. Security.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.816
But you know I want us
to keep working together
like normal.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.658
You're head of security
for this whole place?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.576
Yeah.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.620
Congratulations.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.911
I'm so proud of you.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.667
Thank you very much.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

20:55.796 --> 20:57.957
Hold on. Carter.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.420
Ah, great!

21:04.555 --> 21:06.921
Sorry, boss.
He kind of insisted
that I call.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.720
That device sends
and receives calls anywhere.

21:10.853 --> 21:11.842
What do you want?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.265
It's possible that I did

21:14.398 --> 21:17.890
maneuver events so that
I'd end up traveling
in time to this time.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.650
So you're confessing?
You knew the marker
was in my pocket.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.395
Please,
you have to understand,

21:22.698 --> 21:24.734
I've been
chasing the future
my entire life.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.783
When the opportunity
presented itself, I...

21:28.496 --> 21:29.656
I simply couldn't resist.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.778
And leaving me back there?

21:30.915 --> 21:34.328
Well, sometimes
journeys of discovery
require a sacrifice.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.791
Oh, sure, your discovery,
my sacrifice.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.909
I'm trying
to make things square.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.999
I'd rather not waste any
more time sitting in here,

21:40.132 --> 21:41.997
so if you wouldn't
mind just...

21:42.134 --> 21:44.750
Oh, grow up.
Tried to leave me
in another century?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.252
You're not
getting out of here.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.053
Hey, I thought
we were square.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.177
Ah, we're square.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.806
Hey, sweetheart.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.231
Grace.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.097
You're here working.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.940
No. I'm procrastinating.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.310
I was just
thinking about coffee.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.526
Great minds.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.199
I don't want to bug you,
but I wanted to remind you
about Stan and Jill tonight.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.527
Oh, Henry, look,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.403
we've already cancelled
dinner on them twice.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.905
I'm with a project.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.781
A 60-year-old gadget
that doesn't work

22:15.918 --> 22:17.749
means you can't take
a dinner break.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.370
I'm trying to see if this
cell has any trace charge.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.588
Okay, I get it.
You're working.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.465
I'll bother you later.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.877
And, FYI,

22:29.598 --> 22:31.008
the charge in those
cells is building.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.348
No, the phosphor is clear.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.885
Check the
electron drift speed.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.891
(SIGHS)

22:39.233 --> 22:40.518
Okay, you're right.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.939
I didn't take into account
the 60-year-old
conductive materials.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.730
What, did you think
you married a dummy?

22:48.242 --> 22:49.823
I guess not.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.651
Carry on!

22:56.876 --> 22:58.116
Hey, Vince!

22:58.252 --> 22:59.742
Oh, you have no idea
how good it is to see you.

22:59.879 --> 23:00.868
Likewise.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.745
Yeah, has Zane
been in today?

23:02.882 --> 23:06.215
No, but he should be
picking up his lunch
order any time now.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.130
Okay.
One more thing.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.470
Do you know
if I've asked Tess

23:11.599 --> 23:14.011
any big, life-changing
questions recently?

23:16.562 --> 23:19.395
Oh, my God!

23:20.858 --> 23:22.723
You proposed?
I did?

23:22.902 --> 23:23.812
I don't know.
Did you?

23:23.944 --> 23:24.933
I don't know.
Did I?

23:25.738 --> 23:26.773
Oh, Carter.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.771
What? Hey! One sec.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.775
Look, let's just...
I'll get back to you on this.
Can we keep this quiet?

23:31.994 --> 23:33.700
I'm the vault.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.163
Hi.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.752
Hey.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.210
So Kevin and I were just
talking about his school

23:43.339 --> 23:46.456
and other friends
and girlfriends.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.590
You don't say.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.050
We don't have any secrets.

23:50.721 --> 23:51.801
I'm gonna get
some more coffee.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.046
Baby, do you want
another shake?

23:53.182 --> 23:55.173
I'm good.
Thank you.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.059
Dude,
she has lost her mind.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.891
I know.
She won't stop touching me,
asking me stuff.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.764
She keeps feeding me.
I know. I know.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.108
It's hard watching
your kid grow up.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.897
Seriously, I...

24:08.405 --> 24:09.906
I think she's on drugs.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.031
Well, she's probably
not on drugs.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.534
But, look...

24:16.163 --> 24:18.870
Shoot. I got to go.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.706
Look, you got to
hang in there, okay?

24:21.835 --> 24:23.917
Have some patience,
and we'll talk about it soon.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.331
Okay?

24:25.756 --> 24:28.088
Zane! We need to talk.

24:31.261 --> 24:35.095
So you're thinking
that Zane rewired
the robot's systems?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.385
He has the requisite skills
and a shady history.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.349
Yeah, but itjust doesn't
seem like Zane, though.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.218
I mean, I always thought
that people, at their core,

24:41.355 --> 24:42.686
that they are who they are.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.976
Well, you'll get a perfect
chance to test that theory

24:45.109 --> 24:46.895
right here in
the new world.
Ah, I guess.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.564
That would
bear out the Novikov
self-consistency principle.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.903
Yeah, think of time
as a pond.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.407
When we went back,
we made ripples.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.739
Those ripples made changes.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.825
But the farther away
from us you get,
the ripples fade.

24:56.954 --> 25:02.039
99.99% of the wider world
is the way we left it.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.330
Yeah, but we're gonna use
the machine or the device
to fix that, right?

25:05.462 --> 25:07.748
Yes. Yes. The batteries
seem to be recharging,

25:07.881 --> 25:10.042
and I believe I'll be
able to reverse

25:10.175 --> 25:12.427
(ALARM BLARING)
our temporal impact.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.353
That looks bad.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.735
Dr. Fargo was
perfectly clear

25:31.864 --> 25:34.697
that this entire area of
Section Five was off-limits.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.031
Yeah, use your
brave voice, Larry.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.696
No one's breaking
any rules.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.659
Dr. Fargo
will not accept it.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.612
All right. Well.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.285
I gave them permission to
use this lab for the project.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.407
Thank you, Fargo.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.876
Of course, sir.
My mistake.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.455
Your conference call
with the Secretary of
Defense is in five minutes.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.832
Sorry, Larry.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.753
The Secretary of Defense.
How cool is this job?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.220
Fargo, are you here
for a reason?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.849
Oh, yeah! I got
the scans back on Tiny.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.261
You got to see this.
It's hilarious.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.385
Look at those
gamma signatures.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.012
It looks like there was
an overload of positrons.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.390
I mean,
like that's possible.
(CHUCKLES)

26:09.777 --> 26:10.937
(CHUCKLING)

26:12.529 --> 26:15.487
It's sort of
a physics joke, because...

26:15.616 --> 26:17.152
I'll redo the scans.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.450
Well, I'm glad he's happy,

26:20.579 --> 26:23.036
because this
may be our reality
for a very long time.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.407
I mean, I might be able
to salvage some parts, but...

26:26.543 --> 26:27.658
All right,
is there any way to tell

26:27.795 --> 26:29.410
if somebody did this
on purpose?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.916
Sabotage.
Can't rule it out,

26:32.049 --> 26:34.756
though I'm not an expert
on the technology
from this era.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.467
But you know who is.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.927
Dear Lord.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.885
Not too shabby, huh?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.728
I don't know if you know,
but I started this project

26:48.857 --> 26:51.018
with a handful of scientists
out of some army tents.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.397
My lab table was
an old munitions crate.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.862
Did you ever think
it would turn into this?

26:58.492 --> 27:01.905
Well, I was always a fellow
that could dream big,
but no.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.865
No, not in my
wildest imagination.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.871
You might not want
to light that.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.163
Global Dynamics is
a non-smoking facility.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.286
Please extinguish
your smoking material.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.459
What is it?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.919
Some kind of mobile
patrol system?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.047
Please extinguish
your smoking
material promptly.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.846
You might want
to listen to her.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.637
She? Really?

27:26.854 --> 27:29.061
What kind of propulsion
system does she...

27:29.189 --> 27:30.429
Never mind.
Wait a minute.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.728
Pardon me. Ma'am.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.024
What kind of
propulsion system do you use?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.444
Have a pleasant day.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.160
I think I'm in love
with this place.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.294
Hey, any news?

27:58.427 --> 28:01.009
Hey! Tess is fine.
Oh, good.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.675
She'll probably
sleep for a few hours,
but her tests are good.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.762
Good. Good.
I figured.

28:04.892 --> 28:08.384
Look, something happened
to the bridge device,
and it looks intentional.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.851
Yeah, I heard.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.599
So if you're
gonna ask, ask.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.738
Do you know
anything about it?

28:18.864 --> 28:19.853
You mean,
did I destroy it?

28:20.282 --> 28:21.397
Did you?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.661
Have you talked to Zoe?

28:28.582 --> 28:30.868
Yeah, she's great.
Loving Harvard. Why?

28:31.627 --> 28:33.743
Think about what
it would be like If you
could never talk to her.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.289
Yeah, Allison, I get it.
No, you don't.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.753
What if you could never
know your own daughter?

28:37.883 --> 28:40.249
Never connect to the world
the way she sees it?

28:41.053 --> 28:44.841
Then I would do whatever
it takes to get her back.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.133
Fargo said that he saw you
going down to Section Five

28:50.270 --> 28:52.135
right before the device
was destroyed.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.352
Yeah, I went down there.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.144
I don't know exactly
what it was I thought
I was going to do.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.646
I was denied entry.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.029
The medical director
doesn't have clearance
for Section Five,

29:02.157 --> 29:03.363
so I went back.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.528
I didn't do it, Carter.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.861
But, honestly,
I think that I would have.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.619
Hi, gentlemen.
Any progress?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.587
Hey, Carter.
You seen this?

29:19.716 --> 29:20.751
What?

29:20.884 --> 29:24.468
Excites radiation
into a beam that can cut
through carbon steel.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.132
I don't suppose
you've heard of a laser.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.096
Yeah, I think I have one
in my printer, actually.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.431
So was it sabotage?

29:29.559 --> 29:32.551
There doesn't seem
to be any evidence
of tampering, Sheriff.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.345
You sure?

29:34.856 --> 29:37.393
It seems like a stream
of antimatter positrons

29:37.526 --> 29:40.142
may have overloaded
the power system.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.770
Well, now Fargo said
that's the same thing
happened to Tiny.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.739
So Zane is,
what, firing these things
around for yuks?

29:45.867 --> 29:48.734
Creating antimatter positrons
is incredibly difficult,

29:48.870 --> 29:52.533
so if Zane
has found a shortcut,
he wouldn't be playing jokes,

29:52.666 --> 29:54.873
he would be getting
a Nobel Prize.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.955
I don't believe Zane
is responsible, Sheriff.
I think you were right.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.714
Great.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.918
So that leaves me
exactly nowhere.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.835
Might as well start looking
for a giant red elf.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.470
Excuse me?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.177
No, it's a joke.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.846
Something Tess said
when she was hurt.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.014
She was talking about
a red elf.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.472
Oh, come on.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.645
"Elf" is short
for emission of light

30:20.777 --> 30:22.438
in very low-frequency
perturbations.

30:22.571 --> 30:23.560
I did not know that.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.858
It's a kind of lightning
that occurs in the
upper atmosphere,

30:25.991 --> 30:27.606
along with sprites
and blue jets.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.654
Didn't you study weather
in science class?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.322
Well, I remember
cumulous clouds, and...

30:31.455 --> 30:33.867
No, but this sounds
like positronic lightning.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.239
That sounds bad.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.117
Yeah. It's probably
what overloaded Tiny
and the bridge device.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.709
It's five times
hotter than the sun,

30:39.838 --> 30:41.703
but luckily,
it's incredibly rare.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.046
Oh, except today.
Right.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.040
Plus there's no way
I'll be able to predict

30:45.177 --> 30:47.088
where it's gonna strike next.
(CLANGING NOISE)

30:49.931 --> 30:51.216
Foundit
Uh-huh.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.718
Look at that.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.892
That there,
now that is a red elf.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.979
This isn't safe.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.726
Everybody, can
I have your attention?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.103
Need you to go back
to your labs, please.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.651
Not a drill. Not a test.
Off the floor, please.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.069
Ma'am, sir,
thank you guys very much.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.157
All the way off.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.446
Yeah, you guys go.
You got to go.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.742
Back to your labs.
Off the floor.
Thank you. Go!

31:19.920 --> 31:21.205
Nice elf.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.731
Nasty weather
we're having. Inside.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.599
It's a positronic
lightning storm.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.896
Any idea when
it's gonna end?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.771
No, since this is
the first one
that's ever existed.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.067
There's strikes
all over the building.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.361
Andy's moving employees
into shielded areas.

31:52.494 --> 31:53.574
All right, well,
even if you move fast,

31:53.703 --> 31:54.738
you're gonna
get some injuries.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.736
I'll call in a medical team
and brief Allison.

31:56.873 --> 31:57.828
Okay.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.744
The directory doesn't
show any projects

31:59.876 --> 32:02.288
that could be generating
this much positronic energy.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.536
All right,
how about hobbies?

32:03.672 --> 32:05.628
Maybe somebody messing
around with test tubes,
beakers?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.381
Beakers? Beakers?

32:08.510 --> 32:11.968
Jack, positronic lightning
would be a gigantic project

32:12.097 --> 32:14.053
that would require
constant adjustment

32:14.182 --> 32:15.718
just to keep it
from going out of control.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.011
But it would be
the first steps

32:17.144 --> 32:19.851
toward a source
of terrestrial antimatter.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.850
Limitless, clean energy.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.977
Or antimatter weapons.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.185
That sounds like something
that someone might
want to keep secret.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.481
A white list project.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.073
Oh, great,
there's a name for that.

32:34.494 --> 32:38.703
A DARPA project so
potentially destabilizing

32:38.832 --> 32:41.073
that it operates
with no official record.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.700
Yeah, but it would still
need the permission
of the director's office.

32:43.837 --> 32:44.872
This is the
director's office.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.916
If you gave permission
before you traversed
that wormhole,

32:47.048 --> 32:49.755
you would have
no memory of it, and there
would be no record.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.500
Oh, that is trippy.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.968
Fargo, if you did this...
I didn't.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.009
Not "you" you,
but successful you.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.303
Where would you put it?

33:00.103 --> 33:02.845
I've been very
successful in my career.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.482
Section Five.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.144
But there are hundreds
of labs down there.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.436
Where would you look?

33:08.862 --> 33:10.443
Right where Larry
told us not to.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.157
I'm guessing this is it.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.368
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome, Dr. Fargo.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.821
DNA scan complete.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.831
Iris recognition
scan complete.

33:24.294 --> 33:26.626
Voice recognition scan
incomplete.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.835
Please state your password.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.546
I don't know.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.635
Guess.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.551
Dougie the Vampire Slayer.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.717
Voice recognition complete.
Access granted.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.010
Honestly?

33:47.275 --> 33:50.108
I made positronic
lightning, baby!

33:52.864 --> 33:54.900
You got to be kidding.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.862
We have to find
a way into that lab.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.826
Tell me you didn't.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.119
Did you get
my mini muffins?

34:02.249 --> 34:04.240
You built a positronic array
in my section,

34:04.376 --> 34:06.537
and you made it white list.
You hid it from me?

34:06.670 --> 34:07.705
He had reasons.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.749
Oh, because
he's a paranoid,
secretive dictator.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.167
That is the reason.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.583
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.756
I've never heard
you apologize before.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.342
To anyone.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.843
I'm turning over
a new leaf?

34:26.439 --> 34:27.770
Please stop
yelling at me.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.476
(SCREAMS)

34:29.693 --> 34:31.684
Containment is failing.
You think?

34:31.820 --> 34:33.685
We have to work fast
unless you want

34:33.822 --> 34:35.403
the skeleton of this
building to vaporize.

34:35.532 --> 34:36.692
I vote work fast.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.816
We could purge it
into the bedrock.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.863
We could use a particle drill
to sink the ground wire,

34:40.996 --> 34:42.907
but we still have
to tap the dump coil.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.825
I'll go.
You'll be vaporized.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.834
Then I take it back.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.041
We can't shut it off
without going into the lab,

34:49.170 --> 34:50.706
and we can't
go into the lab
without shutting it off.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.875
Can we do it, like,
with a kite and a key,

34:53.008 --> 34:54.919
like, Ben Franklin-style?
Sort of...

34:56.344 --> 34:57.424
No, exactly.

34:57.554 --> 35:00.341
If we can get
the charge to go to
one area of the lab...

35:00.807 --> 35:01.842
I'm very attractive.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.842
I mean,
positronically-speaking.
I'll be the lightning rod.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.177
But could you
take the pounding?

35:07.314 --> 35:08.724
It'll be
a couple billion amps.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.597
Well, dress me up
in some Compton shielding

35:10.734 --> 35:12.315
to protect me and draw
the lightning, I'll be fine.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.811
I think I got
just the girl who can
lend you that dress.

35:16.406 --> 35:17.691
Move, guys.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.782
We need the shield to be
980 statcoulombs thick.

35:20.910 --> 35:21.899
Hey.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.277
Hi.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.987
Got a Section Five pass
from Fargo.
Nice.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.739
See if you guys
needed any help.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.036
No, Andy's almost ready,

35:29.169 --> 35:31.581
and Tess is sacrificing
a project she's been
working on for a year.

35:31.713 --> 35:34.830
And she does it
with a smile.
She's pretty amazing.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.832
Must be why you asked
her to move in with you.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.303
That's what she
was saying yes to.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.842
She told me,
she was still kind of loopy
from the electric shock.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.139
We're moving in together?

35:52.817 --> 35:56.275
I spent a year realizing
we don't work as a couple,

35:56.821 --> 35:58.436
we break up.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.867
Which is it?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.573
I guess that's
up to you, Carter.

36:17.133 --> 36:21.046
Andy moves along
the east pylons,
attracting the strikes.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.294
You don't have
much of a window.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.840
Okay.
Seventy-four seconds.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.847
Seventy-four seconds?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.678
So move your ass, honey.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.472
Then across the lab,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.219
directly under
the capacitor sphere.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.690
The silver thing?

36:32.816 --> 36:35.808
Exactly. Then directly
behind the sphere
is the dump coil.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.024
Oh, how do I get the...

36:37.153 --> 36:38.984
Every time
you say dump coil,
it sounds so gross.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.900
Right. How do I get
to the dump coil?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.274
Oh, you got to
be kidding.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.901
Any chemical propellant
would explode.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.195
Shoot the bolt
into the coil,

36:48.331 --> 36:50.708
use the drill
and drop the titanium wire.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.370
That should
purge the charge.
Okay.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.128
Sheriff!

36:55.338 --> 36:56.327
What are you doing here?

36:56.464 --> 36:57.453
He volunteered.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.841
I'm the drill guy.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.843
He's the drill guy?

37:02.262 --> 37:03.547
This isn't your problem.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.136
Sure it is.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.971
I've been part of
this town for 60 years.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.386
I can't to pretend
to understand what
goes on around here,

37:09.519 --> 37:10.975
but electricity
doesn't change.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.389
I can handle the drill.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.522
No, I...

37:17.694 --> 37:18.809
Okay.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.028
Hey, Sheriff,
we should get moving.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.830
Yi ppee-ki-yay.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.672
You ready?
Uh-huh.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.589
Go.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.797
(GRUNTS)

37:50.059 --> 37:52.471
Ow! Thought these suits
were supposed to protect us.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.265
From the charge,
not the pain.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.489
There's the dump coil.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.439
HENRY: You got 30 seconds,
Jack. 30 seconds.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.654
Got it.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.204
I'll drop the ground coil!

38:21.841 --> 38:24.253
We should hit bedrock
in about 200 meters.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.803
About 20 seconds.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.794
CARTER: Any time now.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.548
HENRY: Fifteen seconds, Jack,
Fifteen seconds.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.893
This wire's awful thin.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.430
Titanium alloy.
It's as strong as it gets.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.818
HENRY: Jack. Hurry.
You're almost out of time.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.525
Bedrock!

38:57.043 --> 38:58.624
Good job, Deputy.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.460
Hey.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.212
You okay there, Tex?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.759
Oh, yeah.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.177
I mean, don't believe 'em
when they tell you

39:14.310 --> 39:16.471
that lightning
doesn't strike twice
in the same place.

39:16.813 --> 39:20.305
But, how's Andy?

39:21.317 --> 39:22.568
Oh, he'll survive.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.686
Fargo said that he
needs a complete memory
wipe and reload.

39:25.822 --> 39:26.857
Oh, that's okay.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.696
I mean, he enjoyed the time
travel story the first time,

39:28.825 --> 39:31.066
so he'll forget,
I'll tell him again,
it'll...

39:33.830 --> 39:35.946
What are you doing
here all alone?

39:38.001 --> 39:39.832
It's where Zane proposed.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.751
And I didn't answer.

39:46.509 --> 39:50.718
Well, everybody freezes
the first time in combat.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.179
Well, almost everybody.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.265
You got scared.

39:57.478 --> 40:01.266
Doesn't change
how you feel about the guy.
You just got scared.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.807
I just wish
that I said something.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.767
You know, I know that
it wouldn't make a difference,

40:05.904 --> 40:08.441
and I know that he
wouldn't remember now,

40:08.865 --> 40:12.824
but, you know, at least
it would be out there
in the universe, somewhere.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.825
You know, I love the guy.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.789
And he loved me.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.708
Once.

40:31.012 --> 40:32.001
All right.
Here you go.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.639
Thank you.
Bye.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.508
E @9919;

40:35.642 --> 40:37.428
Hey!
How's my hero?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.767
Slightly singed,
but I'm okay.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.805
Listen, we need
to talk scheduling
with the movers,

40:42.941 --> 40:44.477
but I'm whipped.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.816
Electroshock
can be exhausting.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.109
Can we talk
about it tomorrow?

40:49.238 --> 40:50.523
That would be better.

40:50.657 --> 40:51.692
Okay, good.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.984
Hey, I'm going to Dre's.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.618
We might go see
a movie or something.

40:54.744 --> 40:55.699
Well, what about dinner?

40:55.828 --> 40:58.365
This is dinner.
I'll see you later.
Love you.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.121
Hey, loser.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.455
Loseh

41:04.587 --> 41:05.793
That, that means
cool, right?

41:08.800 --> 41:09.880
You okay?

41:10.802 --> 41:12.884
Yeah. Actually,
I'm more than okay.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.799
I'm not sure exactly why.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.801
I don't know.
But it's still difficult.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.049
You better get used to it.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.676
He sounds like he's
a pretty independent kid.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.678
Think I'm gonna need help
with this teenager thing.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.930
Iwill help you.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.062
So, the bridge
device is dead.

41:32.198 --> 41:36.532
And the energy field
is decayed beyond repair.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.909
So this is home, then?

41:47.088 --> 41:48.498
For all of us.

41:49.799 --> 41:51.084
Well, what do you know?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.671
So how do we tell everyone
what happened to us?

41:54.804 --> 41:58.467
All at once.
Pull it off fast, you know,
just like a hangnail.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.302
If people find out
there's an alternate timeline,

42:00.435 --> 42:02.471
it could be destabilizing
and dangerous.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.770
This is dangerous,
having us walk around
like we know what we're doing.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.274
Yeah, but how
would people react?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.766
I mean,
if Henry tells his wife
he doesn't remember her...

42:09.902 --> 42:10.982
I'm not saying
it's gonna be fun.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.852
We need to be honest.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.034
Would I still keep myjob?

42:17.577 --> 42:19.442
Good God.
Listen,
we can't tell anyone.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.786
There's a military protocol
in place for a situation
like this.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.287
You're kidding me.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.749
No, there's
a military protocol
in place for everything.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.712
Anyone who has seen the
future or affected history
is inherently dangerous.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.664
They can further
contaminate the timeline.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.883
Violators will be
isolated and sanctioned.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.386
Sanctioned, like, dead?

42:39.515 --> 42:41.847
No, sanctioned like
we each get a puppy.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.386
We can't tell anyone
what happened.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.808
It has to stay
with the six of us.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.065
Agreed?

42:55.865 --> 42:57.321
Agreed.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.820
Welcome to the new world.
