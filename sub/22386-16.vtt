01:43.037 --> 01:43.802
So, what's the plan

01:43.804 --> 01:46.472
for getting the perfect
wildlife picture?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.540
François and I will bunk
in those braches

01:48.542 --> 01:51.510
so we can get fantastic
face-to-face nature photos.

01:51.512 --> 01:55.114

02:03.958 --> 02:07.659
Hey, did you hear that noise?

02:07.661 --> 02:11.797
Yeah, but I'm sure
it was nothing.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.133
(Yawning)

02:14.135 --> 02:16.568
You're right.
See you in the morning.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.571
Yeah, okay.
Goodnight.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.580
Ah, a cuddly
cocoon of comfort.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.649
Time for a sleepy slumber.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.590

I mean, the elephant?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.760
Hey, that's Gilda
the baby elephant.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.662
All on her own?
That's strange.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.598
Yes. Why is she not
with her mama?

03:19.600 --> 03:22.568
We must
get a family photo.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.604
Except she kind of
broke the ladder.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.071
What do we do?

03:26.073 --> 03:30.342
When in trouble in the treetops,
just yelp for help.

<i> It's busted up badly.</i>
<i> Look!</i>

03:41.322 --> 03:44.323
<i> Can you get us down from our</i>

04:26.800 --> 04:29.768
Thanks for getting up in
the middle of the night, pups.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.671

are stuck in the tree

04:32.673 --> 04:34.840
where they camped
last night.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.842
A baby elephant
knocked over their ladder.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.812
Baby elephant! That's what
we heard outside our tents.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.814
A baby elephant?
Awww!

04:42.816 --> 04:44.683
Cool! A baby elephant?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.818
Marshall, I need you
and your fire truck

04:46.820 --> 04:49.821
to get François
and Captain Turbot down.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.723
I'm fired up!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.959
But we might have
another problem.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.726
What's that, Ryder?

04:54.728 --> 04:57.929
Well, baby elephants are never
far from their family

04:57.931 --> 04:58.964
unless something is wrong.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.834
Gilda must be out looking for
the rest of her herd.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.070
Skye, I need you to use
your helicopter

05:05.072 --> 05:06.672
to find the elephant's
mom or dad.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.740
This puppy's gotta fly!

05:08.742 --> 05:11.710
And find an elephant.

Uh, Ryder,
we found the baby elephant.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.923
Great!
Where'd you find her?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.792
In Marshall's tent.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.994
My tent?

06:40.534 --> 06:41.333
I think she's hungry.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.903
Oh, no! She's not eating my
midnight banana snack, is she?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.938
ROCKY:
Yeah, she kind of is.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.345
Hey!
(Laughing)

06:53.347 --> 06:54.279
Watch it!

06:54.281 --> 06:56.848
Wow, she sure is
thirsty too.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.819
Elephants need loads of lunch
and lots of liquid.

07:00.821 --> 07:04.389
Her family could be
at the watering hole.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.359
Maybe we could get Gilda
to follow us back there.

07:07.361 --> 07:08.260
Rocky?
Right here, Ryder.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.930
We need to load your truck with
bananas and get Gilda to follow.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.864
<i> I'm on it.</i>

07:12.866 --> 07:14.800
The pups
of the PAW Patrol

07:14.802 --> 07:15.967
prepare another
perfect plan. Ha-ha.

<i> Rocky, meet us</i>
<i> at the banana trees.</i>

<i> on Gilda.</i>

08:05.953 --> 08:08.487
(Trumpeting)

08:08.489 --> 08:12.090
Why does she not go in?
She is hot and thirsty.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.392
She's missing her family.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.495
Marshall, keep her busy
until we find them.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.896
No problem!

Whoa!
(Shutter clicking)

08:36.016 --> 08:38.617
Well, it is not
the wildlife photo

08:38.619 --> 08:39.317
I was hoping for,

08:39.319 --> 08:40.986
but it still looks
really good.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.889
Ha-ha.
Very funny.

08:43.891 --> 08:46.458

<i> Gilda's brother!</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:53.431
And her mom!

08:53.433 --> 08:56.968
It looks like she slipped down
into a steep ravine.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.336
(Trumpeting)

08:58.338 --> 08:59.070
And can't get out!

08:59.072 --> 09:03.942
Uh-oh, that's a problem.
A big problem.

09:03.944 --> 09:04.409
It's perplexing.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.411
How to pull
a poor pachyderm

09:06.413 --> 09:09.347
up such a steep
perpendicular precipice.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.048
Uh, what?

09:10.050 --> 09:13.051
We have to get the big mommy
elephant up the hill.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.520
Rubble can help.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.389
<i> Hey, Ryder, what's up?</i>

09:17.391 --> 09:20.025
We need your crane.
Meet us at the ravine.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.345
Okay, Rubble.
Lower the hook.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.447
On it!

10:08.075 --> 10:11.009
Aww!

10:12.679 --> 10:16.414
Now we can lead these
two elephants back to Gilda.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.749
Ready, Rocky?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.484
Ready!

¶

10:24.758 --> 10:26.157

Aww!

10:54.621 --> 10:57.389
"Ze" family

10:57.391 --> 10:59.724
Gilda's such
a cute little elephant.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.593
And you're a bunch
of good pups.

11:01.595 --> 11:06.498
You all did such a great job
helping this elephant family.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.801

Aww!

11:11.505 --> 11:13.438

11:13.440 --> 11:16.441
But of course!
Excellent idea!

11:16.443 --> 11:18.677
I think I must get...

11:18.679 --> 11:21.212
a little closer.

(Trumpeting)

11:27.387 --> 11:29.354
(All cheering)

11:29.356 --> 11:32.190
Thank you for saving
my camera, Gilda.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.525
(Gasping)

11:33.527 --> 11:36.428
Look, everyone!
The perfect photo!

11:36.430 --> 11:40.098
A baby elephant selfie!
Hey-hey!

11:41.168 --> 11:45.470
(Laughing)
(Trumpeting)

11:54.581 --> 11:56.681
(Clucking)

11:56.683 --> 11:58.116
After it!

11:58.118 --> 11:59.684
Gotcha! Ha!

11:59.686 --> 12:03.354
That's how the mayor
shows trash who's boss.

12:03.356 --> 12:03.788
(Snickering)

12:03.790 --> 12:06.725
Since when is a mayor
a street cleaner? Hmm?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.794
Since Adventure Bay
was picked to be a finalist

12:09.796 --> 12:11.296
in the Spotless Town Contest.

12:11.298 --> 12:15.800
Ha! Foggy Bottom has always won
the Spotless Town Contest.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.836
And we're going
to win it this year!

12:17.838 --> 12:21.439
This year, Mayor Humdinger,
that trophy will be ours.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.173
(Paper rustling)

12:24.578 --> 12:26.511
(Clucking)

12:31.551 --> 12:31.816
Ah!

12:31.818 --> 12:35.487
And not a single
piece of trash will stop us!

12:36.790 --> 12:42.694
The trash may not stop you,
but my secret weapon will!

12:44.564 --> 12:46.231
Presenting...

12:48.635 --> 12:51.369
The Kitten Catastrophe Crew!

12:51.371 --> 12:52.403
Ha-ha!

12:52.405 --> 12:56.608
Very good
at being very bad.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.790
MAYOR:
No litter will linger
in my town.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.524
(Whistling)

13:12.526 --> 13:15.660
Quick, kitties,
to the carrier mobile!

13:19.733 --> 13:21.232
(Snickering)

13:23.236 --> 13:24.769
Oh!

13:24.771 --> 13:27.839
This is a complete disaster!

13:27.841 --> 13:30.775
What are we
going to do now?

13:30.777 --> 13:31.676
(Clucking)

13:31.678 --> 13:33.278
Of course the PAW Patrol!

13:33.280 --> 13:35.313
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

13:38.985 --> 13:42.787
¶ Two little puppy dogs
jumping as a double ¶

13:42.789 --> 13:44.289
¶ One named Skye ¶

13:44.291 --> 13:45.957
¶ The other named Rubble ¶

13:45.959 --> 13:47.859
Can I try?
Can I?

13:47.861 --> 13:49.794
¶ It's fun with one ¶

13:49.796 --> 13:50.762
¶ Two's fun too ¶

13:50.764 --> 13:53.965
¶ Now let's see
what three can do ¶

13:53.967 --> 13:54.866
(Laughing)

13:54.868 --> 13:56.768
Sorry,
I couldn't stop myself.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.803
You're doing great, buddy.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.638
Whoo-hoo!

14:00.640 --> 14:01.573
(Thudding)

14:01.575 --> 14:04.409
You were doing great.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.343
Oops.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.378
(Laughing)

14:07.380 --> 14:08.346
Silly pups.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.647
(Phone ringing)

14:09.649 --> 14:10.582
Ryder here.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.684
<i> Ryder!</i>
<i> This is an epic tragedy</i>

14:12.686 --> 14:14.853
<i> of unprecedented proportions.</i>

14:14.855 --> 14:15.787
What wrong,
Mayor Goodway?

14:15.789 --> 14:19.757
<i> Adventure Bay will never win</i>
<i> Most Spotless Town now!</i>

14:19.759 --> 14:22.827
<i> Everything is so totally</i>
<i> not spotless.</i>

14:22.829 --> 14:26.264
Don't worry. No mess is too big,
no pup is too small.

14:26.266 --> 14:30.735
<i> Hurry! The Spotless Town judge</i>
<i> will be here at any moment.</i>

14:30.737 --> 14:32.604
We're on it.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.607
PAW Patrol,
to the Lookout!

14:35.609 --> 14:37.375
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

14:37.377 --> 14:39.644
Uh-oh.
(Barking)

14:39.646 --> 14:41.946
Can you pups lend a paw?

14:41.948 --> 14:43.481
Thanks!

14:43.483 --> 14:45.550
Whoa!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.553
(Dinging)

14:49.356 --> 14:50.355
Whoa!

14:50.357 --> 14:52.056
Whoa!

14:52.058 --> 14:53.758
(Dinging)

14:53.760 --> 14:54.726
Whoa!

14:54.728 --> 14:57.595
(Grunting)

14:57.597 --> 15:00.565
(Beeping)

15:00.567 --> 15:01.466
I'm first!

15:01.468 --> 15:05.336
You made it
and got the high score!

15:05.338 --> 15:07.739
You're a pinball wizard, dude.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.375
(Laughing)

15:24.491 --> 15:28.660
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, Sir.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.028
Thanks for hurrying, pups.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.396
I just got a call
from Mayor Goodway.

15:31.398 --> 15:35.800
Adventure Bay is a finalist to
win the Spotless Town Award.

15:35.802 --> 15:36.434
(Cheering)

15:36.436 --> 15:38.469
But Town Square
has become totally,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.972
mysteriously messy.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.540
ALL:
Boo!

15:42.542 --> 15:43.007
Exactly!

15:43.009 --> 15:45.877
That's why, for this mission,
I'll need...

15:46.513 --> 15:47.912
Chase, I need you
and your spy gear

15:47.914 --> 15:50.748
to find out what's at
the bottom of all this.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.819
Yes! Super Spy Chase
is on the case!

15:54.821 --> 15:57.488
But we still
have to clean up.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.924
Rubble, I'll need you
and your digger shovel

15:59.926 --> 16:01.392
to pick everything up.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.927
Rubble on the double!

16:02.929 --> 16:05.596
And nobody knows what to do
with all that trash

16:05.598 --> 16:08.833
better than our own
recycling pup, Rocky!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.969
Don't lose it, reuse it!

16:10.971 --> 16:14.672
All right!
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.442

17:45.999 --> 17:46.664
Nice work, pups.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.801
Mayor Goodway, how did all this
garbage wind up on the street?

17:49.803 --> 17:53.938
I don't know!
It must've been an accident!

17:53.940 --> 17:54.672
(Sniffing)

17:54.674 --> 17:57.575
It smells too suspicious
to be an accident.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.477
(Chuckling)

17:59.479 --> 18:02.914
(Sniffing)
Huh?

18:02.916 --> 18:03.748
Hmm.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.617
Look! These poor flowers
are wilting already.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.553
Let's get them
back in the ground.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.725
It looks like these flowers
weren't pulled out by accident.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.227
(Yelling)

(Barking)

18:23.770 --> 18:25.770
(Meowing)

18:25.872 --> 18:28.673

the yarn balls?

(Sniffing)

18:29.776 --> 18:31.275
(Sneezing)

18:31.277 --> 18:32.009
Are you okay, Chase?

18:32.011 --> 18:35.012
It's just
my kitten allergy.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.582
Kittens?
Kittens?

18:39.552 --> 18:42.653
Oh, the last flower's
back in place.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.690
Ryder, I picked up
all the garbage!

18:45.692 --> 18:48.259
And I've sorted
the recycling.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.694
Excellent work.
The Spotless Town judge

18:49.696 --> 18:52.930
should be here any minute.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.003
Look out!

18:59.005 --> 18:59.704
No!

18:59.706 --> 19:01.672
Ooh!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.307
Ugh!

19:03.309 --> 19:04.008
(Laughing)

19:04.010 --> 19:08.012
The only prize they'll win
is for trashiest town!

19:08.014 --> 19:10.948
It's okay, Mayor Goodway.
The pups will clean up.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.284
But we already did that!

19:13.286 --> 19:14.085
(Sniffing)

19:14.087 --> 19:15.887
I think I'm closing in
on him.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.589
I just need a better view.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.590
See anything yet, Chase?

19:19.592 --> 19:23.794
Just Mayor Humdinger
playing with some kittens.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.002
Some really naughty kittens.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.638
They just shot mud
on to my spy goggles.

19:33.640 --> 19:38.743
Ryder, I think Mayor Humdinger
has been messing up the town.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.711
Now he's headed
for the water tower.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.882
Hmm. Marshall, I need you
to use your ladder.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.583
I'm fired up!

We'll meet you there.

hatching a diabolical plan.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.039
We prefer
"sinister scheme"!

20:24.390 --> 20:25.656
Nice catch.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.659

20:28.661 --> 20:31.696
Tabby, open the faucet!

20:33.366 --> 20:35.700
(Sirens blaring)

20:36.636 --> 20:39.337
Humdinger's going to use
the water tower

20:39.339 --> 20:41.672
to make the town
a soaking wet mess.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.907
Rocky,
can you stop it?

20:42.909 --> 20:46.110
Just as soon as you help me
up there, Marshall.

20:46.112 --> 20:46.777
(Barking)

20:46.779 --> 20:49.814
Going up!

20:53.386 --> 20:56.020
Step away from
the spigot, kitten.

20:58.024 --> 20:58.723
Uh-oh.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.393
Ugh! Turn it off,
turn it off!

21:02.395 --> 21:04.028
Now, that's a mess!

21:04.030 --> 21:06.731
(Laughing)

21:06.733 --> 21:08.766
Whoa! Ah!

21:08.768 --> 21:11.335
Help!

21:11.337 --> 21:12.403
Uh-oh.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.406
Chase, Mayor Humdinger
needs us.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.074
Gotcha!

21:18.745 --> 21:21.045
(Barking)
Zip line!

21:24.884 --> 21:25.349
Help!

21:25.351 --> 21:29.920
Mayor Humdinger, grab on to that
zip line and slide down!

21:29.922 --> 21:31.856
But what if I fall?

21:31.858 --> 21:34.925
You won't!
We'll catch you.

21:34.927 --> 21:35.726
Ah!

21:35.728 --> 21:41.365
Oh, I'm too scared to look!

21:41.367 --> 21:43.768
Mayor Humdinger,
you can open your eyes now.

21:43.770 --> 21:49.373
Oh, yes, well, of course.
I knew I could zip down safely.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.741
No problem.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.910
(Laughing)

21:52.912 --> 21:55.146
Marshall!

22:01.888 --> 22:04.789
Well, uh, the PAW Patrol
saved me.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.726
I suppose a "thank you"
is in order.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.828
You and your kittens
really made a mess.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.465
We just wanted to win
the Spotless Town trophy.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.099
We're sorry.

22:15.101 --> 22:15.933
If you're really sorry,

22:15.935 --> 22:18.836
you won't mind
helping out a little.

it without your help, Ryder.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.820
And I couldn't have done it
