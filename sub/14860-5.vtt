WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.951
BRAD: Well, big news in the
Williams-Kerkovich house.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.416
Jane's ex Ryan is
coming into town,

00:06.715 --> 00:08.000
and they're having dinner. Oh.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.917
We did a semester at sea
together, and it was ages ago,

00:11.220 --> 00:13.086
and I am just following
our rule, Brad.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.924
(WHISPERS) Whatever. We have
this deal that if an ex comes to town,

00:15.224 --> 00:16.305
we're allowed one dinner
with them,

00:16.600 --> 00:18.182
and the spouse can either
attend or not.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.013
Well, I'm opting
not to dine.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.894
No offense to Ryan.
| just have a Groupon

00:22.189 --> 00:23.930
for a Ladysmith Black
Mambazo concert.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.723
Ooh. And I hate
Ryan, sight unseen.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.608
You're going to see
Ladysmith Black Mambazo?

00:27.903 --> 00:30.019
(IMITATES AFRICAN ACCENT)
JYes, I am J

00:30.322 --> 00:31.858
Sweet. Anyway, don't
worry about the check, guys.

00:32.156 --> 00:32.942
| got this one.
What?

00:33.242 --> 00:34.698
What? (LAUGHS)

00:34.993 --> 00:37.075
| have a little bit of
disposable income these days.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.237
Max, you cannot have
disposable income

00:39.540 --> 00:42.578
when you owe us $11,000...

00:42.876 --> 00:45.789
And three cats. You'll get those
cats when you get those cats, Jane.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.795
And the reason I have
all this extra cashish

00:48.090 --> 00:49.376
is because my new roommate

00:49.675 --> 00:51.257
decided to pay me
five months' rent in advance.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.589
Ah, yes. El nuevo roommate.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.797
When are we gonna
meet this guy?

00:55.097 --> 00:57.088
Oh, no, you won't.
| told that guy that we are

00:57.391 --> 00:59.632
gonna live
totally separate lives.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.926
| will not make the same mistake
I made with my last roommate

01:02.229 --> 01:03.890
and get all invested
in his personal business.

01:04.188 --> 01:05.725
That was me.
Yeah.

01:06.024 --> 01:06.934
And I will not make
that blunder again.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.246
Okay, so Ryan is gonna be
here any... What is happening?

01:22.541 --> 01:24.452
I'm just doing some 'shups.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.116
What do you got going on that you
don't have time to say "push-ups"?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.081
(PANTING)
"Shups for life!

01:28.380 --> 01:29.962
Now to bulk up on some
of my whey powder.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.587
Scoop.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.084
Just like that?

01:35.387 --> 01:36.252
(COUGHING)

01:40.100 --> 01:41.386
It's in my lungs!

01:41.685 --> 01:42.925
Anyway...
(COUGHS)

01:44.354 --> 01:46.561
Oh!

01:46.857 --> 01:49.440
Oh. Listen, there's something
| need to tell you about Ryan.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.896
| wasn't exactly...
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:51.194 --> 01:53.185
Don't care, 'cause I'll be
spending my night

01:53.488 --> 01:55.855
listening to beautiful
African harmonies

01:56.158 --> 01:59.901
and forgetting about
Ryan, who is... A girl?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.489
(LAUGHS) Hi. Oh!
Hi!

02:02.998 --> 02:04.830
Oh! Ryan, this is Brad.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.786
Brad, Ryan.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.668
So great to meet you.
Hey.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.453
Jane, can I use your restroom
before we go? Long flight.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.668
Yes, of course.
It's right through there.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.841
I'm sorry. Okay, I should've
told you earlier, but then I didn't,

02:19.139 --> 02:21.130
and then it was weird and...

02:21.433 --> 02:22.548
(WHISPERS)
Are you mad at me?

02:22.851 --> 02:23.807
What do you think?
Mmm.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.052
Hell, no! Wow!

02:27.356 --> 02:30.064
It's 2013. This is the
new normal. Oh, my gosh.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.851
| mean, I knew you dated girls
in your experimental phase,

02:33.153 --> 02:35.690
but I never got any of
the hot details. (LAUGHS)

02:35.989 --> 02:37.275
Why don't we all stay in
for dinner, you know?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.110
We'll get some wine out,
drink it up,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.525
and really dig
into your sexy past.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.660
(LAUGHS) It's gonna be
an awesome night.

02:43.955 --> 02:44.945
We're not gonna have
a three-way.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.410
It's gonna be
a pretty good night.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.746
So besides withholding
judgment on your new goatee...

02:50.045 --> 02:52.036
Mmm-hmm? ...what
should we do this weekend?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.580
Dinner with Brad and Jane? Or
Max is always doing something weird.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.999
(LAUGHS) Last week,
he pretended to be a psychic

02:57.302 --> 02:59.509
and assisted the police
with a murder investigation.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.547
And with his help, they apprehended
several innocent people. (LAUGHS)

03:02.849 --> 03:04.385
| thought we'd hang out
with my friends.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.517
Your friends...
Dave and Alex?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.803
No, the friends I had
before we started dating.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.688
You know, since we're
a real couple now,

03:10.982 --> 03:12.097
| thought we'd hang out
with both of our friends.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.688
Hmm. Still not following.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.193
Sometimes we'll hang out with
your friends... Totally get that.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.729
Sometimes we'll hang out
with my friends.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.363
Now, here's
where you lose me.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.822
Okay, Pen, imagine a world
where your friends don't exist.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.577
Who would we hang out with?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.247
Uh... Rachel McAdams?
No.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.333
Sully Sullenberger?
Uh-uh.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.618
Oh! Your friends!

03:32.921 --> 03:33.877
Yes! There it is!

03:35.132 --> 03:37.669
Wait.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.131
Man, I guess my new roommate
Chase is moving his stuff in today.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.420
| hope he doesn't try to
weasel his way into our group

03:42.723 --> 03:44.430
like my last roommate did.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.681
Once again, still me.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.265
ALL: Whoa!

03:51.565 --> 03:53.272
ALEX: Chase's
stuff is awesome.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.978
Look at these tchotchkes.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.605
ALL: Whoa!

04:00.031 --> 04:01.271
(GASPS)

04:01.575 --> 04:02.861
Hi.
ALL: Whoa!

04:06.371 --> 04:09.363
Hey, Max. Hey, Max's
friends. I'm Chase.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.657
You sure are.
I'm headed to the gym,

04:11.960 --> 04:13.121
but I stocked the fridge
with some beers.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.706
| also got us a couple
of pizzas from Gino's.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.166
Oh, and, Max,
| hope you don't mind,

04:16.464 --> 04:18.797
but I upgraded your cable
to include the NBA package.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.543
Later.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.504
That guy is so cool!

04:24.806 --> 04:26.388
Why would you want to live
a separate life from that guy?

04:26.683 --> 04:30.768
Well, obviously, I'm regretting
taking such a hard stance on that now.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.770
| mean, is this
restoration hardware?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.022
This is a disaster. We
have to find a way to fix this.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.060
| gotit.
It's so simple.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.696
All we do is stay here, wait for
Chase to come back from the gym,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.232
then we show him how cool
we are, and boom,

04:45.535 --> 04:46.821
he'll wanna be best friends
with us forever.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.906
Now, everybody, just
kind of act cool, you know?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.030
Real cool-like.
ALEX: Yes.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.829
What is that?
Yeah, Dave.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.166
Don't embarrass us
in front of Chase, okay?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.921
So that was how I ended up
giving my mother a kidney.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.424
(CHUCKLES) Classic.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.584
But can we be serious
for a moment?

05:03.887 --> 05:04.922
'Cause I feel like
we've been talking,

05:05.222 --> 05:08.055
but nobody's really
said anything... Sexy.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.012
Okay. Let's not make
Ryan uncomfortable.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.598
Hey. I just want
you to feel free

05:13.897 --> 05:17.310
to reminisce about
your time at sea. That's all.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.476
(CHUCKLES) I don't know, like
pillow fights or Kissing contests.

05:20.779 --> 05:21.644
Maybe somebody's wearing
a little skipper's hat?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.192
Okay. I have
a sexy story for you.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.903
You do?
Yeah.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.818
| remember this one time...
Oh...

05:29.120 --> 05:31.532
...we were at port
at Saint Thomas.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.119
Oh, yeah! And we had
to camp out in the rain.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.125
Yes! Rain. Wet.
Go with that. (LAUGHS)

05:37.420 --> 05:39.411
And we were soaked.
Oh, yeah, you were.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.546
We had to strip down
to our tank tops.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.379
Paint it. Paint a picture.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.545
And we had to snuggle
to keep warm. Mmm.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.213
Ohh. That's when
things got pretty intense.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.972
(LAUGHS)

05:51.268 --> 05:55.512
"Cause we just talked

05:55.814 --> 05:57.020
all night about
feminist theory.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.350
The end.
(CHUCKLES)

05:58.650 --> 05:59.139
The end?
Mmm-hmm.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.775
There's gotta be more.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.401
Well, there was one other
thing. (WHISPERS) Yes. Right.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.610
That was, uh, when we said
that we loved each other.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.239
Right.
What? No.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.400
(LAUGHS)

06:10.370 --> 06:11.075
Huh?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.240
Love?

06:17.752 --> 06:18.958
Well...

06:20.255 --> 06:22.041
All right. Great dinner.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.375
We're gonna call it a night.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.461
Jane and I will go
to our marriage bed,

06:25.760 --> 06:27.797
and, Ryan, you can leave and
do whatever, and I don't care,

06:28.096 --> 06:29.882
and good night.
Sorry.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.842
| gave away my Ladysmith
Black Mambazo tickets for this?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.430
Have you been up all night?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.850
(GASPS) Uncle Jerry.
Yeah, but, you know,

06:43.153 --> 06:44.814
it's paid off 'cause look
what I can do with the cards.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.151
(MAKES WHOOSHING SOUNDS)

06:48.450 --> 06:50.032
(LAUGHS)

06:50.327 --> 06:52.443
Wait. Did Chase not come
home last night?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.408
No. No. And I've had
a lot of time to consider

06:55.707 --> 06:58.745
all of the possibilities
of what could've happened.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.751
(WHISPERS) He definitely
got eaten by a bear.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.787
Okay. In the event that
that didn't happen,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.124
we should probably get
in touch with him,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.506
because it's roommate
protocol. It's a sacred bond.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.962
| do not believe that
that is a real thing.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.422
Bet you thought
it was pretty real

07:09.721 --> 07:10.961
when I rescued you
from that well.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.550
Oh, my God.
The well thing again?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.431
You saved me
from a well once,

07:14.726 --> 07:16.057
and now I gotta hear it
for the rest of my life?

07:16.353 --> 07:17.718
Guys, why don't we just
call Chase and make sure

07:18.021 --> 07:19.511
that he's fine and that
he's not in a bear's stomach?

07:19.814 --> 07:23.023
(SUSPENSEFUL RINGTONE PLAYS)

07:23.318 --> 07:25.184
MEN: Did we all hear
that? Did you hear that?

07:25.487 --> 07:26.977
(SUSPENSEFUL RINGTONE
PLAYING) There's someone scoring our life.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.112
Somebody's scoring our life.
Someone's scoring our life.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.364
Oh, it's his ring.
ALEX: Oh.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.822
(CELL PHONE BEEPS) Why does
Chase have that ringtone? Hello!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.862
Dave, I am on record
as saying you are an idiot,

07:37.165 --> 07:38.121
but in this case,
| think you're right.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.497
| mean, Chase could be
in serious trouble.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.625
No one leaves
their cell phone.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.706
Unless you happen
to fall into a well.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.495
(WHISPERS) Okay, a real
gentleman saves someone from a well

07:45.799 --> 07:46.664
and never mentions it again.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.094
Think, damn it!
All right, guys,

07:52.389 --> 07:54.721
can't we just call
Chase's work or his family?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.598
Dave. Why don't you leave
the sleuthing

07:56.893 --> 07:58.429
to the pro sleuthers here?

07:58.728 --> 08:01.140
And besides, it is totally
obvious what we need to do.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.350
So obvious. (SCOFFS)

08:03.650 --> 08:05.436
We gotta make sure
we have, uh... The clue...

08:05.735 --> 08:07.100
...the proper DNA samples. Blood,
hair, DNA. Get to the right path

08:07.404 --> 08:08.269
that leads to that
fork in the road.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.606
Make sure that
that gets to a lab.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.943
Okay, I'm just gonna check
Chase's phone for texts.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.324
Check his phone!
Check his phone!

08:14.619 --> 08:17.327
Boom! The most recent ones
are from a woman named Veronica.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.703
You can never
trust a Veronica.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.581
You know, I had a boyfriend
named Veronica.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.663
Turns out
he was a woman.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.418
Oh. Okay. What do we do next?

08:25.714 --> 08:27.625
BOTH: We gotta
contact CTU.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.416
ICU. The ECU. Yes. 'Cause
there could be an emergency.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.959
We gotta contact TCU,
Texas Christian University.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.626
And we'll find out
through them. Yeah.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.342
| just texted Veronica,
pretending to be Chase.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.472
She's on her way over
right now.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.804
BOTH: Text her as Chase!

08:41.104 --> 08:43.515
Guys, come on. Can we
just focus? You're acting silly.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.055
Are you wearing
Chase's jacket, Dave?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.393
Where does he get
such fine corduroy?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.607
...so then I just asked
her directly, and it turns out

08:50.905 --> 08:52.020
it was one big
misunderstanding.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.233
(LAUGHS)

08:54.576 --> 08:57.739
So... Nothing else
happened?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.530
No obstacles you had to
hijinks your way out of?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.539
No one brought a miniature
pig to a car dealership

09:02.834 --> 09:04.700
to prove a point
about gender roles?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.210
No. We hardly ever use
tiny livestock to prove points.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.126
Oh!
(LAUGHS)

09:10.425 --> 09:13.543
Ooh! Check out
red shirt diaries over here!

09:13.845 --> 09:16.553
Spill much? Have a little cheese
with that wine, you stupid clumsy bitch!

09:16.848 --> 09:17.462
(LAUGHING)

09:19.559 --> 09:20.924
Up top!

09:21.227 --> 09:21.967
Oh. Oh.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.224
You guys don't
do pile-ons?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.934
| am so sorry.
Let me help you.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.144
Uh, uh, wait...
Waitress, some club soda!

09:29.444 --> 09:31.560
Did you want my shirt?
Or here's... Here's $100.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.321
On second thought, the red
suits you. You're beautiful.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.902
"Cause you look so good, I'm
gonna do it to myself. (LAUGHS)

09:36.201 --> 09:36.861
No, no, no. Duh, duh, duh.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.819
And here we are
in our early days.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.612
You can see
our love is blossoming.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.372
In case you can't,
here's a bar graph showing

09:44.667 --> 09:47.250
that she loves me more than
anyone or anything ever.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.957
Look, the numbers don't lie.
This is science.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.417
It took you five hours
to make this, huh?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.377
Yep. In between my 'shups.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.757
He means push-ups.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.339
"Shups for life!

09:56.638 --> 09:58.595
Hey, um, I think that
| should probably go.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.550
Oh.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.557
Okay. Sure. Yeah.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.435
(MONOTONE VOICE) Oh,
man, She's leaving. No, don't go.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.936
| really wish you would
(NORMAL VOICE) leave.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.020
Brad, what is going on
with you?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.275
You know that Ryan and |
were forever ago.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.777
We're just friends now.
We're like Portia and Ellen.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.940
Portia and Ellen
are married. What?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.699
What? (WHISPERS)
Portia's a lesbian? Yeah.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.486
Anyway, the point is, we've
dated a lot of people in the past,

10:22.789 --> 10:25.702
and we should be able
to be adult around our exes.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.413
It's time to grow up. You know
what? You're right. I'm sorry.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.248
Let's have a do-over dinner
with Ryan tonight.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.789
Okay? I promise
to be an adult.

10:34.092 --> 10:34.706
Thank you.
Yeah.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.292
Is that Photoshopped?
Hmm?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.505
Uh, no, it's not
Photoshopped, Jane.

10:42.934 --> 10:43.890
It's Adobe cut and paste.

10:48.565 --> 10:52.103
Hello?
Oh. It's you, Veronica.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.767
We've been waiting for you.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.902
And we have some
serious quest... Ow. Oow!

10:56.197 --> 10:58.063
Damn it. Why'd you
guys talk me into this?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.107
You know I'm not good
at dramatic swivels.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.118
Where's Chase? Why don't
you tell us, tootsie pops?

11:03.413 --> 11:04.869
You were the last person
to see him alive.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.872
Alive? What are you guys
talking about?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.783
You sure ask
a lot of questions, lady.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.042
We found this briefcase
in Chase's room.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.044
We need the combination
to get it open.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.296
Did you even check
to make sure it was locked?

11:15.592 --> 11:19.210
Oh. I'm sure Chase just leaves
unlocked briefcases all over the place.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.503
I'm sure I'm just gonna press these
buttons here and it's gonna open.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.015
It opened.
Bye. Idiots.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.471
What's in it? A gun?
Cash? (DOOR CLOSES)

11:26.769 --> 11:28.225
Looks like
just bunch of old bills.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.386
You know
what we need to do.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.181
Yeah. Just...

11:32.483 --> 11:33.439
We gotta always be closing.
Chase those leads and...

11:33.735 --> 11:35.601
We gotta close it.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.939
"Cause closing is
for closers. Exactly.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.070
Hi, this is Chase Regan.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.027
My credit card was stolen
about 20 minutes ago.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.068
Could you tell me where the
last place it was used, please?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.657
BOTH: Call the
credit card company!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.446
Chase's credit card was used

11:48.750 --> 11:50.240
at a restaurant downtown.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.534
Let's go.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.327
You are not leaving the house
in Chase's glasses!

11:54.631 --> 11:57.168
But I look like Dwight Howard.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.299
No. No. He looks like
Rachel Maddow with a goatee.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.881
Yeah.
That's even better.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.137
That's why I think we're not
worried enough about the debt ceiling.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.385
Oh, I get it.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.842
You're the Dave
of the group,

12:09.145 --> 12:10.977
always talking about stuff
nobody cares about. (LAUGHS)

12:11.272 --> 12:12.103
We all care about this.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.310
Yes. Yes. It is a very,
Very serious issues.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.821
(SING-SONG VOICE) And I
was testing you. You passed.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.526
(CELL PHONE ALERT CHIMES)

12:22.825 --> 12:24.315
(GASPS)

12:24.619 --> 12:26.030
Jane and Brad are about
to eat dinner with her ex,

12:26.329 --> 12:28.491
who is a girl.
Hmm.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.373
(GASPS) And Alex says Chase
is missing and bears are involved.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.332
Who's Chase? Who
cares, Pete? He's missing.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.669
Okay, look, you put in a great effort
today with my friends, and I appreciate it.

12:39.968 --> 12:40.924
So would you like
to go see your friends now?

12:41.219 --> 12:43.335
Please, yes!
(CHUCKLES)

12:43.638 --> 12:45.845
Although if we leave without
an excuse, won't they get mad

12:46.140 --> 12:47.096
and then, like,
ice us out of the group,

12:47.392 --> 12:48.382
and then everybody'll
take sides

12:48.685 --> 12:50.642
and then it's like,
"Who gets the friends?"

12:50.937 --> 12:51.802
No, Penny,
because they're normal.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.562
Guys, we're gonna take off.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.063
See you later.
Bye.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.270
All right, see you.
Bye.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.775
(WHISPERS)
They're not buying it.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.482
Guys, we must take a flight
now to Europe. Oh, boy.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.446
It's a diplomatic
emergency. No. Time to go.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.488
And I will see you all when
I'm back from the continent.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.158
Bye!

13:14.460 --> 13:18.454
Brad, I really appreciate you being
so adult about this while Ryan thing.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.713
Well, I'm just glad that we're
both being adult about this.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.499
The both of us.
(DOORBELL RINGS)

13:22.802 --> 13:25.920
Which I'd why I've decided to
invite another adult to dinner.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.257
(LAUGHS)

13:29.809 --> 13:33.268
My old friend Melissa, who
also happens to be my ex.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.227
What?

13:37.525 --> 13:38.265
(LAUGHS)

13:41.988 --> 13:44.946
Okay, so you invited one of your
exes to dinner? Real adult, Brad.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.902
(MOCKING)
"Real adult, Brad."

13:47.201 --> 13:49.989
So, uh, Brad, you said this
was a business school reunion.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.450
Is anyone else coming?
You know how it is.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.956
You know, Rosen with work.
Franklin moved to England. Uh-huh.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.366
Chad and Lisa with the baby.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.081
Chad and Lisa had a baby?
| don't know. Probably.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.667
| just feel like we
haven't talked in forever.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.798
You know?
Especially for two people

14:04.093 --> 14:07.051
who had such a deep
emotional connection.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.508
(WHISPERS) I miss it.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.514
| can respect a bond
that happened in the past.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.301
Oh. Jane, you have nothing
to worry about.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.844
| mean, it was just a fling.
Purely physical.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.938
Physical?

14:19.233 --> 14:22.442
Totally in the past. A lot has
changed for me since then.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.694
Physical?
Oh, it was real physical.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.229
(LAUGHS)

14:26.532 --> 14:29.365
Real physical.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.651
Talking about sex kind
of physical. With socks off.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.989
Okay.
Yeah.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.654
And to completion
most of the time.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.413
Correction...
All the times. (LAUGHS)

14:37.502 --> 14:39.288
It was so hot.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.952
But I'm sure you can be an
adult about it. Right, Jane?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.086
Of course I can.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.547
Let's pick a new topic.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.469
Have they come up
with any new soups lately?

14:49.764 --> 14:51.095
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Thank
you for coming to Brad and Jane's.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.052
I'm sorry we left
your friends early,

14:53.351 --> 14:57.390
but trust me, we are in for
one crazy roller coaster ride.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.187
Whee!

15:08.616 --> 15:11.574
Okay, gang, whoever
abducted Chase is here,

15:11.869 --> 15:14.236
and using his credit cards while
he's probably off in the desert,

15:14.539 --> 15:17.327
alone and scared,
begging God for death.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.615
The vultures are picking
at him. There he is.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.503
Well, well, well!

15:23.798 --> 15:25.288
We have been searching
all over town for you.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.207
Worried sick, mister.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.502
And we find you having a fancy
steak dinner with one of your floozers!

15:30.805 --> 15:31.636
CHASE: Um...
I'm sorry. Who are you?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.889
I'm his roommate.
And who are you, lady?

15:35.184 --> 15:38.017
I'm his wife.
ALL: Whoa.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.054
<i>God. You gotta be kidding
me, Chase! A roommate?</i>

15:41.357 --> 15:42.973
Are you really renting
another sex shack in the city?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.937
(WHISPERS) He is so cool!

15:45.236 --> 15:47.477
| knew you wouldn't change.
You know what?

15:47.780 --> 15:48.736
Now I don't feel so bad about
sleeping with your brother.

15:49.031 --> 15:49.645
Oh.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.280
Ya see...

15:57.582 --> 16:02.918
There's a roommate protocol, and I
believe that that leads to a sacred bond...

16:03.212 --> 16:04.373
Mmm-hmm. Between
two people under one...

16:04.672 --> 16:06.834
Yep. Uh, you see, uh, one
time, Max was caught in a well.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.294
| could've gotten out of that
well. Yeah, but you didn't.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.879
You didn't get out of it.
Wait.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.009
Is that my jacket?

16:13.598 --> 16:16.761
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

16:17.059 --> 16:21.269
And that's why I think everyone's
just overreacting to the debt ceiling.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.680
Ugh. Speaking of
the debt ceiling...

16:23.983 --> 16:26.816
Mmm-hmm?
Ryan, I remember, uh,

16:27.111 --> 16:29.068
when you used to write me
those love notes.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.945
(WHISPERS) what does that
have to do with the debt ceiling?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.231
(WHISPERS) Shh! Bad transitions
means the excitement's about to start!

16:33.534 --> 16:37.323
Well, Melissa left me a
lot of notes, too. Sex notes.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.578
Some were even sent
through the federal mail,

16:38.873 --> 16:40.864
so it was basically
a sex crime.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.828
No. No. No. That is
something completely different.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.502
(EXHALES)
Regardless, it was hot.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.915
| guess you were just pleasuring
women all over the place.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.175
And I guess you were just
lovin' everybody you meet!

16:52.470 --> 16:53.335
(WHISPERS) Here we go!

16:53.638 --> 16:55.549
Ooh! That's a nice deck.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.430
(LAUGHS) | love a good
deck. I'm gonna go check it out.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.840
(STAMMERING)
Oh, I'll join you.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.508
| think we should go, too.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.393
(WHISPERS) What? No!

17:02.688 --> 17:04.144
| mean, you're probably right,
but I'm telling you,

17:04.440 --> 17:06.021
Max's thing is not gonna
be better than this.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.809
What? It was Chase's wife?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.193
And your place is
his sex shack?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.320
And he works out?
This is so much better!

17:13.616 --> 17:15.778
Well... (SIGHS)

17:16.077 --> 17:18.068
She's definitely
leaving me.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.079
And since I work for her dad,
I've also lost my job.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.829
Oh, that's messed up, man.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.490
| bet your brother
gets that job.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.329
It's been a tough day.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.960
What do you say
we all get back home

17:28.256 --> 17:30.247
to that nice, buttery
leather brown couch

17:30.550 --> 17:31.540
and just chill out?

17:31.842 --> 17:33.458
No, I'm not living with you.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.047
Uh-huh. And I'm also
taking my stuff back.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.761
And just so you know...

17:39.016 --> 17:40.598
Sometime in the near future,

17:42.019 --> 17:43.851
| am going to ruin your life

17:45.064 --> 17:46.520
like you ruined mine.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.740
That guy's so cool. | know.
I'm shaking in my boots.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.275
Do you think that that's gonna
come back to haunt me eventually?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.536
Yes.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.163
Penny, I gotta admit,
your friends are a lot of fun.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.950
Yay! Then it's settled. We'll
only hang out with my friends.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.539
Come on.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding.

18:08.838 --> 18:09.248
We'll hang out with
your friends. Okay.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.379
When mine are busy.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.132
Mmm.
Congratulations.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.089
Crack the whip, girl!
(IMITATES WHIP CRACK)

18:18.598 --> 18:20.305
You always said it was
just an experimental phase.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.841
Well, I'm sorry that I forged
such a deep connection with Ryan

18:23.144 --> 18:24.680
that she never got over it.
(GASPS)

18:24.979 --> 18:27.220
Well, I'm sorry | gave
the good stuff to Melissa

18:27.523 --> 18:28.604
in a way that no man
could ever repeat!

18:30.151 --> 18:32.017
Oh, come on!
Is everybody a lesbian now?

18:33.904 --> 18:35.144
Fudge! (SIGHS)

18:37.450 --> 18:38.861
Fudge! Fudge! Fudge!

18:39.160 --> 18:40.776
Brad, I'm so sorry.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.611
| mean, we could've
avoided all of this

18:43.914 --> 18:45.404
if I had just told you
the truth about Ryan.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.915
Well, I shouldn't have
gotten so upset.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.668
| don't know. I just thought I was
gonna hear about all the fun, sexy stuff,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.954
and then she said
all the love stuff,

18:53.257 --> 18:53.792
and I wanna be the only
person you ever loved.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.040
Aw! Boo!

18:58.888 --> 19:00.003
You're the person I love
the most,

19:01.432 --> 19:03.673
and I always will.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.308
And just so you know, sex with
Melissa wasn't even that great.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.514
| mean, she never really
seemed that into it.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.224
(PROMPTING)

19:09.523 --> 19:11.605
Oh! Right. Right.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.391
Yeah, she does not enjoy
my anatomy.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.855
Mmm-mmm.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.566
Hey, just to avoid
any future confusion,

19:17.865 --> 19:19.026
which of your other exes
were girls?

19:19.325 --> 19:23.114
Oh. Yeah. Well, uh,
Sydney was a girl.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.404
Tracy was a guy. Aaron
was a girl. Jordan was a guy.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.165
Lane was a girl. Uh,
Morgan was... Stop.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.167
Just... No more, please.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.372
(CHUCKLES) It's just, uh...

19:32.672 --> 19:35.585
And Brad is a man.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.957
The man.
Mmm-hmm.

19:40.971 --> 19:41.756
My man.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.101
Okay, Brad, that's enough.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.942
Aw! Just five more minutes.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.477
You said that five minutes
ago. Time for bed now.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.738
| hate bed.
Mmm...

20:01.033 --> 20:01.773
Say thank you
to the nice ladies.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.570
Thank you, nice ladies.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.453
| never get to have any fun.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.204
Ohh. We're about to go
upstairs and have sex right now.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.911
(GASPS) Ooh! Can you check
my pants for monsters?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.792
| always do.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.794
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:19.009 --> 20:19.965
Eyes forward.
Okay.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.126
Eyes forward.
Left, right.
