00:01.084 --> 00:02.794
PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar…

00:02.961 --> 00:04.213
NEAL: The <i>Mosconi Codex.</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:05.422
You're gonna steal it for me.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.590
NEAL: <i>When does it end?</i>

00:06.798 --> 00:09.009
PETER: <i>You left him bleeding</i>
<i>on the sidewalk.</i>

00:09.092 --> 00:10.260
I didn't kill the dude.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.262
I pulled that badge and gun
outta the trash. I swear.

00:12.429 --> 00:16.016
PETER: <i>Summers told us where she hid</i>
<i>the $2 million, but it wasn't there.</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:18.227
NEAL: <i>A chiropractor's office?</i>
MOZZIE: <i>It'll look the part.</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:20.062
Agent Gruetzner.
We've been expecting you.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.647
JONES: <i>Any reason</i>
<i>he'd slip away to come here?</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.023
PETER: <i>Neal always has a reason.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:25.817
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.320
NEAL: <i>This stained glass window</i>
<i>could be right here in Manhattan.</i>

00:35.077 --> 00:36.703
PETER: This is where Neal was standing.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.790
For 20 minutes, after which he went
straight home, according to his anklet.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.292
From this intersection,
you could scout a museum,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.127
two banks and a gallery,

00:44.461 --> 00:46.296
not to mention
all the residential targets.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.714
Peter, I made some calls.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.466
There was no suspicious activity reported.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.468
Not unless you count
Neal Caffrey being here.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.847
You think I'm overreacting?

00:54.930 --> 00:57.474
No, I just think we might
consider the possibility

00:57.850 --> 00:59.768
that Caffrey was just picking up
some groceries.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.187
Long walk for a loaf of bread.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.023
Okay.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.900
So what was he doing there?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.986
First, there was the missing cash,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.196
then the FBI pen
at the chiropractor's office,

01:11.405 --> 01:12.573
and now this street corner.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.949
So what do you think it all adds up to?

01:14.116 --> 01:15.200
That's the problem.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.369
I can't see how it all connects.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.829
I'm missing something.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.416
See if any cameras in the area
picked up anything.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.667
Will do.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.379
Listen, I also ran the card
that you found in Siegel's badge.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.964
Talked to the real estate company.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.049
No one knew what "Cooper 3?" meant.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.011
I looked through Siegel's old case files,
friends and family back in Chicago.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.346
Hell, I even looked on Google.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.599
No hits. Sorry.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.393
Listen, I hate to ask you this,

01:41.476 --> 01:43.312
but you don't think Caffrey knows anything

01:43.395 --> 01:44.813
that he's not telling us, do you?

01:45.022 --> 01:46.440
-About Siegel?
-Yeah.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.026
-I don't.
-All right.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.954
Checked black market code words,

02:01.038 --> 02:03.332
drop locations, CI names.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.584
Mozzie even tried to tie it to DB Cooper.

02:05.918 --> 02:06.919
Nothing.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.630
Maybe it's an FBI agent
grasping at straws.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.714
Hey.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.300
We both know your instincts
are rarely wrong.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.803
Well, for now, we've got
a stolen shipping crate

02:16.887 --> 02:18.305
that demands our attention.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.308
Grabbed from Canadian Customs
this morning

02:21.391 --> 02:23.018
by a fraudulent trucking company.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.479
The driver ran. No sign of him yet.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.191
Must be some exotic Canadian contraband
to get you out of the office.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.568
Oh, this is well
worth a stretch of my legs.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.279
Don't tell me.
It's diamonds from the Diavik mine

02:34.363 --> 02:35.739
in the Northwest Territories.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.491
Maybe it's maple syrup.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.785
Hey, you joke, but the great
Canadian maple syrup heist

02:39.868 --> 02:41.119
was worth 18 million.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.829
You'd need a bigger crate though.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.248
PETER: And a lot of pancakes.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.791
Special Agent Burke. Go ahead.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.710
(WOOD CREAKING)

02:49.127 --> 02:50.462
It's like Christmas morning.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.756
No, it's not a gift.
This is stolen property.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.258
I know the line gets blurry for you.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.677
Based on the size of the box
and the country of origin,

02:56.760 --> 02:59.638
my best guess is
a sculpture from Emanuel Hahn,

02:59.721 --> 03:01.598
Canadian artist, circa 1918.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.517
Oh, this is better than Christmas.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.937
This is a dinosaur egg.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.609
PETER: Even now you kind of expect it
to crack open, don't you?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.403
I really don't.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.322
A fossilized egg doesn't
capture your imagination?

03:17.406 --> 03:18.699
Well, the value of it does.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.410
Hello? Excuse me. I'm Dr. Khatri.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.537
I'm one of the curators
of the Natural History Museum.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.830
Agent Peter Burke.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.540
You're the one who found my egg.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.917
Well, he can't take all the credit.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.502
And where's the mother?

03:31.628 --> 03:32.671
What do you mean?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.549
There was a second shipment
containing the mother.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.967
What kind of mother?

03:37.301 --> 03:38.719
A Tyrannosaurus rex.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.555
You're saying there's a Tyrannosaurus rex

03:41.638 --> 03:43.307
lost somewhere in New York City?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.436
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:02.409 --> 04:05.162
PETER: Tyrannosaurus rex
was being shipped simultaneously

04:05.245 --> 04:06.330
on a different truck.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.664
No sign of it anywhere.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.249
Hunting a T. rex.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.084
Seven-year-old me would be going crazy.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.836
Adult you isn't exactly serene.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.421
I can't wait to see it in person

04:14.671 --> 04:16.340
when it's reunited with its egg.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.843
Mozzie used to create fake fossils
and bury them at dig sites.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.053
Used to?

04:21.678 --> 04:22.721
It's been a couple months.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.182
The alternate history of
the Earth according to Mozzie.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.475
That's terrifying.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.435
I'm just saying, the black market is rife

04:28.519 --> 04:30.020
with fake fossils like this.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.355
Do we know the egg is real?

04:31.647 --> 04:34.274
Khatri ran an acid test
and authenticated it.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.860
Well, people with way
too much money and no subtlety

04:36.944 --> 04:39.488
do love to put them in their office
as a display of power.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.366
Yeah, what bigger display
than a T. rex and its egg?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.577
Whoever the buyer is,
it's clear they want the entire set.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.454
Valuable alone, invaluable together.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.164
It's like having Queen Mary's
diamond riviere

04:49.248 --> 04:50.541
without the La Peregrina pearl.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.293
Jones is working on a list of suspects.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.462
I gotta get home.
What are your plans tonight?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.631
Uh, I'm just gonna relax at home.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.716
Do a little light reading.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.974
-Hey.
-I'm really happy that you called.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.726
I found something,
and I brought something.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.980
Yeah, I should've mentioned…

05:13.480 --> 05:15.774
Agent Gruetzner will be joining us.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.193
Hello.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.196
A rare book expert and a wine connoisseur.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.240
(SIGHS)

05:23.490 --> 05:24.491
Oh!

05:24.741 --> 05:26.076
California Zin.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.413
Well, there's no shame
in having one specialty.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.290
Uh, you said you found something?

05:31.582 --> 05:34.334
Uh… Yes. Yes, I did.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.753
Um, so I was looking
into the stained glass window,

05:36.837 --> 05:38.755
and I stumbled across this.

05:40.549 --> 05:41.592
Wow.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.845
Oh!

05:45.012 --> 05:46.513
Mosconi's grave site.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.265
Uh, yes.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.766
Just look down here at the bottom.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.268
NEAL: It's a Masonic compass.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.519
So he was a Mason.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.021
I should have noticed it sooner.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.191
I mean, this is why
he put the Chapter 13 into the Codex.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.943
Thirteen is considered a sacred number
for the Brotherhood.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.904
He was sending a message
to the other Masons.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.530
The Codex could lead us anywhere.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.949
I mean, Masons have their hands
in everything.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.076
Finance, government, art.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.494
Untimely death.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.163
Look at the date on the gravestone.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
April 17, 1887.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.417
That's the same month
he finished the window.

06:15.501 --> 06:16.752
That must have been his final work.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.129
Do you think that he was killed
because of all of this?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.840
If that's so,
the stained glass could tell us why.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.010
Well, thanks for everything.
We'll take it from here.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.346
Oh…

06:27.429 --> 06:29.431
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.476
Yes, thank you for coming over
and for the wine.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.810
Sure.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.980
Dinner on Wednesday
without the chaperone?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.649
Of course, Agent Caffrey.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.819
I look forward to working with you
more on all of this.

06:42.903 --> 06:43.904
(CHUCKLES)

06:49.910 --> 06:50.911
What?

06:51.662 --> 06:52.955
I got it under control.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.165
Well, I hate to report the obvious news,

06:55.249 --> 06:58.544
but the last thing you are
right now is under control.

06:58.836 --> 07:02.673
Luckily, you have a guardian angel
looking over you.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.263
This is less angel and more stalker.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.807
I vetted her, a cursory audit.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.434
Financials, education, daily schedule.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.563
She keeps a tight routine,
speaks three languages,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.356
studied two years in France.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.568
Here, just keep it. Just in case.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.285
T. rex and her egg were owned legally

07:31.368 --> 07:32.870
by a man in Toronto for 50 years.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.455
He kept it in his family room
until he died three months ago.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.457
That's a hell of a pet to get your kids.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.584
Big pooper scooper.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.295
He dictated that, upon his death,
it be donated to the museum.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.256
I'm guessing someone tried to
persuade the estate to sell it instead.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.632
Lots of someones.

07:48.886 --> 07:49.887
Who do we like?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.639
Well, there's a number of people
who pursued it very aggressively.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.016
Lots of escalating offers.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.642
And a lot of suspicious people
making them.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.352
Anyone only try once?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.188
Yeah, there were two single bids.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.899
I mean, one was a lowball offer,
but then there's this guy.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.651
He made a single high-priced offer,
then nothing.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.238
Brett Forsythe, the corporate raider,
made millions from hostile takeovers.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.698
I've heard of him.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.659
He led a takeover of a company
called Aegis last year.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.329
That's the kind of guy who knows
when someone's not gonna sell,

08:15.412 --> 08:17.414
and his only option
is to take what he wants.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.166
I'm gonna pay him a visit.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.672
I'm sorry, Mr. Forsythe
is unavailable at the moment.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.090
Of course he is.

08:28.467 --> 08:32.346
Well, if you could tell him
that Agent Burke of the FBI,

08:32.429 --> 08:35.933
White Collar Division,
would like to speak with him.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.268
I can wait here as long as it takes.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.146
I'm sure these guys
would love to keep me company.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.068
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

08:47.778 --> 08:51.031
That's probably her boss
telling her that I can see him now.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.784
When you took over Aegis,

08:53.951 --> 08:55.994
the board didn't know
you'd stolen their company

08:56.078 --> 08:59.540
until you walked through the door
and fired all of them.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.583
That was my legal right, Agent Burke.

09:01.834 --> 09:02.835
It was.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.879
And then you sold off pieces
of the company one by one,

09:06.922 --> 09:08.382
made a great profit.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.926
Lost a lot of jobs.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.346
The feds questioned me about
the Aegis takeover a month ago.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.806
It was all aboveboard.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.474
I know.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.643
Why are you here?

09:19.935 --> 09:21.645
Is that a Velociraptor skull?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.816
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. I should sell it.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.403
Thanks to <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
everyone thinks they're an expert on them.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.488
Except the movie got everything wrong.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.535
Velociraptors were most likely feathered,

09:38.328 --> 09:41.498
based on the quill knobs
found by paleontologists.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.792
And the film made them much larger,

09:43.876 --> 09:46.461
more like the size of a Deinonychus.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.589
That's true.

09:48.964 --> 09:52.301
Velociraptors were closer
to the size of a chicken.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.761
Still, one mean-looking chicken.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.638
And very dangerous.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.641
Are you a collector?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.977
(SCOFFS) On a government salary?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.314
I'd barely be able to afford
an ankle joint.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.526
How'd you get it?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.948
There are many legal ways
to purchase fossils, Agent.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.658
True.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.619
Many illegal ways as well.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.329
That why you're here?

10:20.913 --> 10:24.333
To question the legality
of my Velociraptor?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.752
No, I'm hunting something bigger.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.171
A T. rex.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.590
Thought you said you weren't a collector.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.008
It's not for me.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.427
It was supposed to go to a museum,

10:36.011 --> 10:37.387
but didn't make it there.

10:37.804 --> 10:41.850
Agent Burke, even if I stole
a Tyrannosaurus rex,

10:41.934 --> 10:43.352
which I did not,

10:44.353 --> 10:45.646
what would I do with it?

10:45.938 --> 10:49.358
It's not like
I could just put it on display.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.529
That's a good point.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.909
But what a thing to have.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.834
You think he has
an actual skeleton in his closet?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.418
I don't know what he's hiding in there,

11:08.502 --> 11:11.755
but there was a large open space
right underneath the raptor skull.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.299
Well, he stalled when you got there.
That gave him time to move it.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.134
So chances are it's illegal.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.012
Is that what takes you so long
to come to the door when I knock?

11:19.096 --> 11:21.223
You think I'm hiding
illicit goods under my bed?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.724
I think you're hiding something.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.271
But I don't have enough for a warrant

11:27.354 --> 11:29.231
to search Forsythe's office.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.361
You should stake it out, see what happens.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.530
Especially around 6:00 p.m.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.157
I'll keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.910
You said the empty space
was near the raptor skull?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.369
PETER: <i>Yeah, right underneath.</i>

12:24.870 --> 12:26.246
It's not empty anymore.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.791
Now there's a mean-looking club there.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.046
Looks pre-Colombian.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.924
Forsythe must have
moved it back after I left.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.597
As long as I'm here,

12:44.848 --> 12:46.517
I should see what else he's hiding.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.520
No, get the picture and get out.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.897
The trick with sliding locks

12:51.980 --> 12:54.942
is they leave a smudge that
can tell you what the code is.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.235
(SPRAYING)

12:56.318 --> 12:58.195
<i>This does not sound like you getting out.</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:00.364
The key is guessing where
it starts and where it ends.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.907
Is he right or left-handed?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.326
Right. Why?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.662
<i>Right-handed people</i>
<i>instinctively draw counterclockwise.</i>

13:06.745 --> 13:07.955
(KEYPAD BEEPING)

13:11.625 --> 13:13.627
I told you to get out.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.799
Forsythe has a whole lab back here.

13:19.675 --> 13:23.929
<i>Microscopes, test tubes,</i>
<i>all kinds of forensic equipment.</i>

13:33.021 --> 13:34.481
Forsythe came back.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.109
-Almost done.
-Did you set off an alarm?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.485
Peter, that's hurtful.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.654
Either way, he's headed your way.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.823
All right, leaving now.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.577
Where are you?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.513
Where are you?

14:26.158 --> 14:27.326
It's called a macuahuitl.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.493
"Macua-neenle."

14:28.577 --> 14:30.329
-No, "macua-heetle."
-"Macua-heednum."

14:30.579 --> 14:32.289
-No, "macua-heetle."
-I said that.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.249
Okay, either way, your hunch is right.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.211
It was stolen from
a pre-Colombian exhibit here in New York.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.214
I guess Forsythe does some business
in the black market after all.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.591
Yeah, but get this.
It was stolen eight years ago.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.385
(LAUGHING) Statute of limitations is up.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.222
Forsythe's a smart guy.
He knows we can't get him on it.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.225
Oh, sure, he didn't want to raise
a red flag in front of a bull.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.768
Not when he's hiding something bigger.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.355
For a job as big as a T. rex,
he'd wanna use somebody he can trust,

14:56.438 --> 14:58.065
somebody he'd used before.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.108
Any suspects in the macuahuitl theft?

15:00.192 --> 15:02.069
There were no arrests,
but there were three suspects.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.863
One's in jail.
One recently questioned in Prague.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.741
Then there's this guy, Michael Holt.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.077
Suspected in four other
robberies along the East Coast.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.745
PETER: He doesn't stay in one place
very long.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.539
No, but even a master thief
needs time to unload

15:13.622 --> 15:15.249
a 40-foot prehistoric skeleton.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.043
Either way, we've got a narrow window
before he leaves town.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.253
Track him down.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.629
Before we do,

15:21.255 --> 15:23.507
you wanna know why Caffrey
was standing on that street corner?

15:24.258 --> 15:25.467
Yeah, I do.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.636
What do you have?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.388
Not what. It's who.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.932
I got this off a security camera
from across the street.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.433
PETER: She looks familiar.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.311
Her name's Rebecca Lowe.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.940
PETER: Yeah, the woman we brought in
from the Gershon heist a while back.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.317
What's Neal doing with her?

15:54.413 --> 15:56.623
You know, I was talking to El,

15:57.207 --> 15:59.626
she has a friend she'd
like to set you up with.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.671
Does this friend know
that I come with a rap sheet?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.673
Uh-huh. Interested?

16:04.798 --> 16:07.968
Tell Elizabeth thank you,
but I'm not looking right now.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.345
Well, it's been a while since Sara,

16:11.180 --> 16:12.890
and I thought you might
wanna get back out there.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.600
Not that it's difficult for you.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.934
You'd be surprised.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.561
Anyone I date, I have to lie to

16:17.644 --> 16:19.563
or wonder why she's interested in a felon.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.814
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-No luck at all?

16:22.524 --> 16:23.775
Yeah, Jones?

16:24.526 --> 16:25.652
Where to?

16:27.196 --> 16:29.072
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Yeah.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.324
Okay, thanks.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.451
Holt's gone.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.994
Jones checked his credit cards.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.704
He bought a plane ticket
out of the country.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.123
The only reason I'd buy
a plane ticket under my name

16:38.207 --> 16:41.418
with my credit card is if I wanted someone
to think I'd left the country.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.295
The airline confirmed
that he got on the plane.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.923
The airline confirmed someone
with Holt's ticket got on the plane.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.925
You know that time
you thought I was in Monaco?

16:48.008 --> 16:50.511
Don't tell me that I had Interpol
scouring the streets for nothing.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.514
Bought a first-class ticket under my name
and checked in for my flight.

16:53.764 --> 16:57.059
Once I got to the gate, I looked for
someone traveling alone with a carry-on.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.937
If someone checks a bag
and doesn't get on the plane,

17:00.103 --> 17:01.230
the flight doesn't take off.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.649
So I offer them my ticket,
which of course they're gonna take

17:03.732 --> 17:06.360
because no sane person
facing a 3,000-mile trip

17:06.443 --> 17:08.153
is gonna say no to a seat in first class.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.364
And they don't suspect an ulterior motive?

17:10.489 --> 17:13.200
Not everyone is as naturally
suspicious as you, Peter.

17:13.450 --> 17:17.120
My nature has developed from years
of tracking your suspicious behavior.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.790
So this unsuspecting stranger

17:19.915 --> 17:21.917
gets your ticket, gets on the plane…

17:22.000 --> 17:23.836
And Neal Caffrey is on his way to Monaco,

17:23.919 --> 17:26.547
while the real Neal Caffrey
slips out of the gate unnoticed.

17:27.506 --> 17:28.966
I can't believe you never knew that.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.762
Cameras caught Michael Holt
scoping out their security system.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.264
He's still after that egg.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.974
He thinks it's at the museum.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.142
Catching Holt in the act is our best shot

17:39.226 --> 17:41.019
at tracking down that stolen T. rex.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.647
I'll put surveillance teams
outside the museum around the clock.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.023
-Keep me posted.
-All right.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.362
Well, I guess someone else
enjoyed that first-class ticket.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.572
So…

17:52.197 --> 17:54.533
Holt had a half million
good reasons to stay.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.536
How did you know what
Forsythe was gonna pay Holt?

17:57.786 --> 17:59.872
I found a briefcase
full of cash in his back room.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.081
And you opened it?

18:01.540 --> 18:04.626
See, this is the reason
I have a suspicious nature.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.920
I'm gonna count every penny of it.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.797
I don't blame you. You should.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.591
(SIGHS)

18:10.674 --> 18:12.885
It was a rough estimate though.
Just a round number.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.018
-Hey, hon.
-Yeah?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.561
How'd you like to go
on a double date tonight?

18:22.728 --> 18:25.314
-With Trey and Sheila?
-Neal.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.065
Does he know we're coming?

18:27.149 --> 18:28.192
Hmm.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.526
He doesn't know we're coming.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.613
He's been sneaking around
with this woman,

18:32.696 --> 18:34.031
and I think he's up to something.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.700
Or maybe he's having
a nice meal with a nice girl.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.244
There's no reason
for Neal to keep this from me.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.371
What do I care if he's going
on a date with a girl?

18:41.747 --> 18:43.040
Clearly you care quite a bit.

18:43.207 --> 18:44.541
Nah. There's more to it than this.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.835
A lot of things Neal
has been doing don't add up,

18:46.919 --> 18:49.379
and my gut tells me
she's at the center of it.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.007
Now according to his anklet,

18:52.966 --> 18:54.301
they're at the Clifton.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.930
You know I've always wanted
to go to the Clifton.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.056
Really?

19:00.057 --> 19:02.184
-You think this is a good idea?
-I do.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.896
-Thought you might like this.
-The wine is lovely.

19:06.355 --> 19:10.567
You know, it reminds me of this summer
that I spent in France studying.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.071
I actually think
I've been to this vineyard.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.364
Really?

19:16.073 --> 19:17.241
Really.

19:18.534 --> 19:21.245
Did you have the FBI
run a background check on me?

19:21.411 --> 19:23.956
The FBI had nothing to do
with this dinner. I promise.

19:24.039 --> 19:27.709
Hmm. You know, you never told me
why you became an FBI agent.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.878
I assume it wasn't only to pick up women.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.548
How does an art lover
become an FBI agent?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.801
It's a long story.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.347
I spend my life studying ancient texts.
I don't mind long stories.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.641
I want this dinner
to be about you and me, okay?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.476
We don't need to talk about work.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.395
All right.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.773
I really do like this place

19:50.482 --> 19:54.778
and the wine and the Codex and the kiss.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.446
I liked that part, too.

19:56.989 --> 20:00.033
You know, you…

20:00.951 --> 20:03.537
You don't have to do all this
just to get my help on the case.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.456
-Do you really think I would do that?
-No.

20:06.540 --> 20:10.502
-What kind of guy do you think I am?
-I don't know. You're an FBI agent.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.546
Yeah.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.756
If it's too complicated, I'll understand.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.803
Are you trying to give me a way out?

20:20.012 --> 20:21.889
Apparently without much subtlety.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.973
No.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.143
I don't want one.

20:27.436 --> 20:28.604
Do you?

20:29.354 --> 20:30.355
No.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.565
PETER: Neal?

20:33.150 --> 20:35.777
Peter, what are you doing here?

20:36.111 --> 20:38.739
Elizabeth has been dying
to try this place out.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.908
Hi, I'm Peter, Neal's boss.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.327
We've met. I'm Rebecca.
You almost arrested me.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.870
Oh, right. Sorry about that.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.997
No, it's… Wait, I thought your boss was…

20:47.080 --> 20:49.416
And this is Elizabeth,
Peter's lovely wife.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.044
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm really sorry for interrupting.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.337
Oh, nonsense.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.464
-No secrets between friends, right?
-'Course not.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.926
I didn't know that you two had been
in touch since the investigation.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.344
You guys met on a case?

21:00.427 --> 21:03.388
Oh, yeah, you know how sometimes
your personal and professional lives

21:03.472 --> 21:05.849
just crash into each other
without any notice.

21:06.016 --> 21:08.060
-It's actually how Peter and I met.
-Oh!

21:08.143 --> 21:10.604
Yeah, Agency resources were
involved from what I recall.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.231
It was completely aboveboard.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.735
Actually, we were just talking
about how Neal became an FBI agent.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.196
Yeah, but it's a long story.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.532
I know I'd love to hear that story.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.954
Uh, I'm gonna go check
and see if we can get a table.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.081
Would you like to go with me?
Maybe let the boys chat?

21:29.164 --> 21:30.290
Of course.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.834
(NEAL CHUCKLES)

21:33.710 --> 21:35.045
See you in a little bit.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.674
(WHISPERING) What are you doing here?
Did you follow me here?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.050
You have until they come back

21:40.133 --> 21:42.135
to explain why she thinks
you're an FBI agent,

21:42.219 --> 21:43.512
or I'm telling her the truth.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.306
We met on a case.
I told her I work for the FBI.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.475
-She assumed I was an agent.
-And you didn't correct her, did you?

21:48.559 --> 21:49.726
I didn't see any reason to.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.687
Because you're impersonating
a federal officer.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.855
I suppose technically…

21:52.938 --> 21:55.065
No, not technically. You are.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.485
The pen, the chiropractor's office.

21:58.569 --> 22:00.821
This is all to convince her of this story.

22:00.904 --> 22:01.989
You're…

22:04.867 --> 22:06.076
You like her, don't you?

22:06.827 --> 22:07.828
(SCOFFS)

22:08.537 --> 22:10.956
Lying is a funny way of showing it.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.128
She doesn't look at me
like a criminal, okay?

22:17.588 --> 22:20.924
She looks at me the way El looks at you.

22:22.301 --> 22:23.719
I don't want to ruin that.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.514
Neal, you have lovely friends.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.640
Oh, aren't they great?

22:28.724 --> 22:30.517
We are gonna get out
of your hair right now.

22:30.601 --> 22:31.977
We got a table. Come on, let's go.

-(LOCK JIGGLING)

All right, remain calm, Doctor.
We have agents in the museum.

22:51.038 --> 22:54.082
No, I'm not there. I took the egg
to my lab to run a CAT scan.

22:54.583 --> 22:57.669
Hang up and find someplace safe.
We'll be there soon.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.797

Dr. Khatri's in trouble.

but we're closer.

You better tell me where it is!

23:12.226 --> 23:13.727
What, you think I'm playing games?

23:14.269 --> 23:15.521
DR. KHATRI: I'll never give it to you.

23:15.604 --> 23:16.647
It's Holt.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.773
HOLT: I'm not gonna ask again.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.317
If we go in with guns drawn,
he might shoot her.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.194
Khatri's not giving up that egg.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.947
We gotta come up with something,
or she's gonna get herself killed.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.031
(CLATTERING)

23:26.114 --> 23:27.366
Where the hell is the egg?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.117
Where is the mother?
What have you done with her?

23:29.201 --> 23:31.245
It's just an egg. Tell me where it is.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.704
It's so much more than that.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.581
It is a child that needs
to be with its mother,

23:34.748 --> 23:36.667
and I'll be damned
if I'll ever give it up to you.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.763
Where is the damn egg?

23:49.930 --> 23:50.973
I'll show you.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.851
No, you can't give it to him.

23:53.934 --> 23:56.520
I'm not taking a bullet for a fossil,
all right?

23:57.062 --> 23:58.105
Follow me.

Right through here.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.575
Get off of me!

Very thoughtful of you.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.083
(GRUNTS)

24:26.300 --> 24:29.469
Holt confirmed that Forsythe hired him
for the fossil heist.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.305
So why are you not doing

24:31.388 --> 24:32.890
an "About to get the dinosaur"
happy dance?

24:33.098 --> 24:35.434
Because he doesn't know
where the dinosaur is located.

24:35.893 --> 24:37.436
And if we arrest Forsythe now,

24:37.519 --> 24:39.688
there's no guarantee
we'll get the T. rex back.

24:39.771 --> 24:43.192
And our evidence is largely
circumstantial. I want hard proof.

24:43.275 --> 24:44.818
-You want the dinosaur.
-Damn right I do.

24:44.902 --> 24:46.653
JONES: Dr. Khatri will be happy
to hear that.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.655
Just got off with the hospital.

24:49.323 --> 24:51.408
She's fine, just a little shaken up.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.702
There's only one chip
we can play right now.

24:54.328 --> 24:55.329
The egg.

24:55.412 --> 24:56.455
We can plant a tracker on it.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.457
I bet he'll stash it
with the T. rex fossils.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.875
Follow him, make a clean arrest.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.376
I don't wanna put the egg in play.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.128
It's too valuable, too important.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.631
Oh…

25:06.465 --> 25:07.716
Lucky for us,

25:07.925 --> 25:11.637
we know someone
with a history of forging fossils.

25:16.934 --> 25:20.854
Dr. Khatri gave me fragments of real
calcite shell and sedimentary rock.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.856
I'll sculpt the core from alabaster.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.733
-Adhesives?
-Already mixed.

25:24.816 --> 25:25.984
We should get started.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.195
I assume you don't mean the royal we?

25:28.278 --> 25:29.488
A correct assumption.

26:29.590 --> 26:31.550
with the calcium carbonate in the shell.

-Hmm.

26:38.557 --> 26:41.768
At least Peter won't be able
to follow this tracker to Rebecca.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.688
Oh, have you spoken to her
since your ill-fated dinner?

26:46.106 --> 26:47.357
I warned you, Neal.

26:47.441 --> 26:49.067
You, business and women.

26:49.151 --> 26:50.944
Unholy trinity, I get it.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.571
Well, you can be grateful

26:52.654 --> 26:56.450
that the Suit didn't expose
your agent nom de guerre.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.993
Well, I am.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.370
What happens when Peter digs deeper?

27:00.579 --> 27:03.081
-Could find out about the Codex.
-Yeah, or Hagen.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.583
Cause for concern.

27:04.917 --> 27:07.211
Keep in mind, to make an end
is to make a beginning.

27:08.045 --> 27:09.546
You think I should end it with her?

27:09.671 --> 27:11.006
That was T.S. Eliot.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.800
But if Rebecca is on Big Brother's radar,

27:14.343 --> 27:15.761
the timing could be right.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.847
All right, do we have a game plan
for the church yet?

27:18.931 --> 27:20.265
I'm working on it.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.184
But to steal the stained glass window

27:22.267 --> 27:24.019
will be difficult with so many witnesses.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.230
Well, that's a problem
that can wait a day.

27:26.647 --> 27:27.689
Indeed.

27:28.649 --> 27:31.109
Today we revive the Cretaceous Period.

27:31.527 --> 27:32.903
Tomorrow we steal a window

27:32.986 --> 27:35.280
that could be connected
to a bedlamite's tome.

Not bad.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.706
I was gonna give it to you after this,

27:44.790 --> 27:45.791
but if you don't think it's very good…

27:45.958 --> 27:47.709
-"Not bad" doesn't mean "Not good."
-It doesn't mean "Good."

27:47.793 --> 27:48.919
I'll give it to someone
who can appreciate it.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.754
No, this is FBI property.
I can take it if I want.

27:50.838 --> 27:52.506
Okay, the tracker's live.

27:53.090 --> 27:55.217
When Forsythe moves the egg,
we'll be right behind him.

27:55.384 --> 27:56.718
Neal, tell us about your cover.

27:56.802 --> 27:59.054
John McDowell.
Accomplice to Michael Holt.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.598
Here to deliver the egg
because the FBI is looking into Holt,

28:01.682 --> 28:02.724
and he's laying low.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.769
Which was confirmed by Holt when
he called Forsythe to set up the meeting.

28:05.853 --> 28:07.271
We'll have ears on you the whole time.

28:08.272 --> 28:11.108
With a forgery like this,
you should be out quickly.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.360
With a half million in cash.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.655
The FBI is investigating Holt?

28:17.239 --> 28:18.365
Should I worry?

28:18.490 --> 28:20.742
Ah, it's just one agent
shaking every tree he can find

28:20.826 --> 28:22.744
to see what falls out.
He doesn't have anything.

28:22.828 --> 28:25.289
But to be safe, I'm here instead of Holt.

28:26.415 --> 28:28.625
Hey, if you don't want the egg anymore,

28:28.709 --> 28:30.502
-I'm sure I can unload it somewhere else.
-No, no, no, no.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.713
It's fine.

28:33.547 --> 28:34.631
I wanna see it.

28:47.019 --> 28:48.020
(LAUGHS)

28:49.897 --> 28:52.482
Uh-uh. No, it's not yours yet.
Not till you pay me.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.902
You're getting ahead of yourself.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.405
I need to authenticate it first.

28:59.323 --> 29:00.699
Let's get a move on.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.328
Tick tock.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.297
(BEEPING)

29:15.380 --> 29:18.217
Calcite levels and pebble texture
appear appropriate.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.343
I assume that's good news.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.136
Oh, it very much is.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.222
Then I think this is
the part where you pay me.

29:23.305 --> 29:24.348
I will.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.392
After one last test.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.438
Can't tell you how many times

29:31.522 --> 29:33.440
two-bit hustlers have tried to rip me off

29:34.441 --> 29:35.859
with fake artifacts.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.033
Which is where the CAT scan
comes in handy.

29:44.201 --> 29:46.245
He won't see an embryo on a CAT scan.

29:46.328 --> 29:47.788
But he will see the tracker.

29:55.754 --> 29:58.173
The scan will take about 10 minutes.

29:58.674 --> 29:59.967
So settle in.

30:00.634 --> 30:03.387
Look, I didn't think this was gonna be
an all-day thing. Okay?

30:04.137 --> 30:05.556
You worried the scan won't work?

30:06.348 --> 30:08.725
No, I just don't understand
what this thing is gonna show you

30:08.809 --> 30:10.102
that all the other tests didn't.

30:10.978 --> 30:12.688
It'll show me what's inside.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.858
Or what isn't.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.367
We need to pull Neal out of there.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.578
Wait, Dr. Khatri should
have a CAT scan of the egg.

30:27.661 --> 30:29.329
I'll call to see
if she can send one to us.

30:34.710 --> 30:36.378
You ever heard of a macuahuitl?

30:37.504 --> 30:39.631
It's the weapon you're holding
in your hands right now.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.426
What else can you tell me
about this weapon, John?

30:44.469 --> 30:46.805
Anything about this one in particular?

30:47.890 --> 30:50.267
I stole it for you eight years ago

30:50.350 --> 30:51.768
with Holt right here in New York.

30:53.145 --> 30:54.313
You're holding it wrong.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.982
You mind?

31:00.360 --> 31:03.447
The early macuahuitl handle
is two inches wider at the top.

31:04.448 --> 31:05.741
Hold it like this.

31:06.074 --> 31:09.578
Better grip means a faster swing.
More control.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.004
You're right.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.092
You know, I've stolen a lot of things,

31:25.219 --> 31:27.179
but I've rarely taken
anything just to have it.

31:28.388 --> 31:29.932
You should try it sometime.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.436
(BEEPING)

31:35.062 --> 31:37.231
We should be at the embryo
any moment now.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.572
Yeah?

31:46.406 --> 31:47.616
Why is he here?

31:48.742 --> 31:50.911
Fine. I'll be right there.

31:52.412 --> 31:53.664
Who's here?

31:54.831 --> 31:58.710
That FBI agent. Still shaking his trees.

31:59.670 --> 32:01.296
Don't worry, I'll get rid of him.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.057
Mr. Forsythe, thanks for seeing me.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.809
I won't take up much of your time.

32:14.601 --> 32:18.897
Michael Holt, he's our prime suspect
in the fossil shipment theft.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.232
What's it got to do with me?

32:20.440 --> 32:23.151
I was wondering if maybe he
approached you on buying them.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.033
Well, if he contacts me,
you'll be my first call.

32:30.909 --> 32:31.994
All I wanted to hear.

32:32.244 --> 32:33.412
Then you'll be on your way.

32:36.665 --> 32:40.335
You know, even though
their name means "Speedy Thief,"

32:40.502 --> 32:43.922
they say that the Velociraptor
wasn't particularly fast.

32:44.173 --> 32:47.509
-That's true.
-And that it was dumb. (CHUCKLES)

32:47.593 --> 32:50.304
Yeah, not much room for a brain
in there, I guess.

One slow, dumb chicken with big teeth.

32:54.349 --> 32:55.934
Don't touch the skull.

32:56.018 --> 32:58.353
How do you keep them glued in there?

32:58.562 --> 33:00.063
Epoxy or tacky?

33:00.147 --> 33:01.690
Agent Burke, don't…

33:04.526 --> 33:06.320
Guess you should've used Super Glue.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.281
-Is that all?
-Mmm.

33:17.414 --> 33:19.166
Sorry I broke your dinosaur.

when they think no one's watching.

the FBI handles natural selection.

-Yeah, on the way over.

FORSYTHE:
What the hell are you doing here?

34:35.701 --> 34:36.994
I thought about what you said.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.705
I figured out what I wanna take.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.459
How'd you follow me?

34:45.752 --> 34:47.379
That little guy told me where you were.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.841
Or at least a GPS tracker
we put inside it did.

You know, it's not too late
for you to be a paleontologist.

35:38.347 --> 35:40.015
Some things are better
enjoyed from a distance.

35:40.641 --> 35:41.892
Like grand larceny.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.560
Are all of your hobbies illegal?

35:43.644 --> 35:44.728
I like chess.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.438
You hustled chess in Union Square.

DR. KHATRI: Agent Burke.

Mr. Caffrey, follow me.
You need to see this.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.199
Here she is.

35:57.491 --> 35:58.492
She's…

was only possible because of you two.

I know someone who would love
a year-round pass.

Agent Burke, you have VIP status here.

-I can be fancy.
-Thanks for the invitation, but…

36:31.483 --> 36:32.568
It's not an invitation.

36:33.485 --> 36:34.486
So it's an order?

36:34.570 --> 36:35.612

36:51.420 --> 36:52.713
Another amazing meal.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.173
Well, it should be. It's your recipe.

36:54.256 --> 36:55.757
Should've thrown it on a barbecue.

36:56.216 --> 36:57.634
Never let him be sous chef.

36:57.718 --> 36:59.303
-He's actually very good on the barbecue.
-Mmm.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.267
So, Rebecca.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.853
-Yeah, Rebecca.
-What do you wanna know?

37:08.270 --> 37:09.605
Have you told her everything?

37:10.480 --> 37:11.523
Everything?

37:11.607 --> 37:12.774
Why you're working for the FBI?

37:12.858 --> 37:14.526
-Why you're wearing an anklet?
-Has she seen it?

37:14.610 --> 37:17.446
Okay, I was waiting for the right time.

37:18.572 --> 37:19.740
There's no right time, Neal.

37:21.033 --> 37:22.492
What do you think happens
if I tell her the truth?

37:23.035 --> 37:24.995
The more time passes,

37:25.078 --> 37:26.580
the more the truth will hurt.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.041
If you really want this to work,

37:29.458 --> 37:30.542
tell her now.

37:31.585 --> 37:32.878
Pray she'll accept it.

37:34.963 --> 37:36.006
You agree?

37:36.089 --> 37:37.758
If you really care about Rebecca,

37:37.841 --> 37:39.301
she deserves to know the real you.

37:40.260 --> 37:44.306
Okay, if Peter had told you
something like this when you first met,

37:44.932 --> 37:46.266
would you have accepted it?

37:48.435 --> 37:50.604
Honestly, Neal, I… I don't know.

37:51.522 --> 37:53.106
But I'd want the choice to decide.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.400
And so will Rebecca.

37:56.235 --> 37:57.611
It's a risk you should take.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.310
You're a lot like him.

38:33.438 --> 38:36.066
How did you feel when
he told you he was a criminal?

38:38.402 --> 38:39.570
It hurt.

38:40.821 --> 38:42.114
But I loved him.

38:42.489 --> 38:45.158
And it didn't matter what he was.

38:45.576 --> 38:47.619
It only mattered who he was.

38:50.998 --> 38:52.708
I wish I could separate the two.

I don't want it to stop.

I don't either.

39:38.545 --> 39:39.546
Yeah?

you should know about me.

who you met at dinner.

40:22.089 --> 40:23.632
to get your help with the Codex.

all so you could lie to me?

-Are you even researching the Codex?
-I am.

I needed your help, all right? And I…

40:45.487 --> 40:47.948
I didn't expect this.

I didn't expect us.

over one little window.

That's right, I know that
the Codex leads to the window.

42:12.574 --> 42:14.952
Isn't it lucky you were already
planning to steal it for me?

42:15.619 --> 42:17.204
That was what you were planning,
wasn't it?

42:19.039 --> 42:20.832
-Of course.
-Good.
