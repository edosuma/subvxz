01:28.388 --> 01:29.557
Alex!

01:32.860 --> 01:34.461
Another nightmare?

01:36.163 --> 01:38.365
Do you wanna tell me
about it?

01:38.398 --> 01:41.401
It's... complicated.

01:47.909 --> 01:50.344
Try and get some sleep.

01:50.377 --> 01:53.715
It's only a few more hours
before everyone gets here.

02:50.872 --> 02:52.674
Sybil! Time for breakfast!

03:11.993 --> 03:13.795
- Whoa!
- Papa Nickolaou!

03:13.828 --> 03:17.297
Alex! Who are you racing this
fine morning?

03:17.330 --> 03:19.534
No one. You can't lose
when you're not racing anyone.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.737
Yes, but you
can't win either.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.506
You're getting swifter
every day,

03:25.540 --> 03:26.674
which means
you are growing.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.375
Not fast enough.

03:30.845 --> 03:33.581
Everyone grows
at exactly the rate
they were meant to.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.983
But I suppose
some breakfast might help.

03:47.729 --> 03:50.430
Uh, no books
at the table, please.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.270
- What are you reading?
- It's called <i>Last Flight</i>
by Amelia Earhart.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.941
It's her notes and diaries
of how she crossed
the Pacific Ocean

03:59.974 --> 04:04.277
- all by herself.
- Not entirely by herself,
as I recall.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.646
I believe she had
a navigator with her.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.414
- Yes, it's Fred Noonan!
- That's him.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.649
Didn't do her much good,
apparently.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.951
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.719
I imagine it must be
very comforting

04:11.753 --> 04:13.588
to have someone with you
when you're lost.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.523
Being alone
is a very hard thing.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.391
Everyone should have someone
they can get into
a little mischief with.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.562
- Speaking of which...
- Eh, eh.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.764
Eat your breakfast.

04:29.504 --> 04:30.805
- Done.
- Me, too!

04:35.543 --> 04:37.310
Sybil!

04:38.679 --> 04:40.681
Aw, it's good to see
the girls together again.

04:40.715 --> 04:41.916
Yes, it is.

04:43.818 --> 04:45.485
I saw
your post from Peru.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.420
The whole country
looked amazing.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.890
It was kind of haunting.

04:48.923 --> 04:51.092
The City in the Clouds,
apart from it all.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.960
- Sounds beautiful.
- It was.

04:52.994 --> 04:55.830
Oh, Andres,
it's so beautiful here!

04:55.863 --> 04:57.064
- Ooh!
- Stop, it Alex.

04:57.098 --> 04:58.065
Who is Andres?

04:58.099 --> 05:00.333
You haven't told them
about your foreign fling?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.369
It's not like that
and you know it.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.005
What foreign fling?

05:04.038 --> 05:06.473
Oh, he's this handsome
Peruvian travel buddy...

05:06.507 --> 05:09.076
who you keep on texting!

05:09.110 --> 05:11.411
He's helping me
with my Spanish.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.914
- Mm-hmm?
- Oh, yeah?

05:12.947 --> 05:14.715
Say one thing in Spanish.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.385
<i>Te quiero mucho.</i>

05:18.418 --> 05:19.554
<i>Mucho, mucho!</i>

05:19.587 --> 05:20.955
Enough!

05:20.988 --> 05:22.056
I hereby terminate

05:22.089 --> 05:25.126
this preposterous
Peruvian pen pal
conversation

05:25.159 --> 05:29.997
and submit a motion
to commence the first challenge
of this year's Nickolathlon.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.766
I second it!

05:31.799 --> 05:32.900
What's the challenge?

05:32.934 --> 05:34.702
- Archery.
- Easy.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.937
Not so fast.

05:35.970 --> 05:37.905
It has been decided

05:37.939 --> 05:40.107
the first challenge
of this year's Nickolathlon

05:40.141 --> 05:42.510
shall be archery!

05:42.543 --> 05:46.681
Three targets,
three arrows, no excuses.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.665
This is ridiculous.
How do I even aim
with this thing?

06:04.699 --> 06:08.903
Three targets,
three arrows, no excuses!

06:08.936 --> 06:10.605
All right, all right.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.712
Ooh! So close.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.701
Um, I-I did that on purpose.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.603
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm. Okay.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.061
Ooh!

07:14.702 --> 07:16.070
It's not over yet!

07:16.103 --> 07:17.705
Zoey could still
win this round

07:17.738 --> 07:20.074
for hitting the closest
to the target.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.683
I can't believe it!

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
It's neck and neck!

07:29.850 --> 07:31.719
Things are really heating up

07:31.752 --> 07:35.122
as we head into the third
and final round.

07:40.061 --> 07:42.964
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.957
Oh! Way off course!
Don't know what happened there.

08:09.991 --> 08:11.826
With Alex and Theo eliminated,

08:11.859 --> 08:14.195
this is Zoey's window
to get it all.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.664
This is the showdown
of the century!

08:16.697 --> 08:19.233
It's cousin versus cousin.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.635
Young versus old.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.604
They're one year apart.

08:34.015 --> 08:37.818
Yes! You did it! That pencil
didn't stand a chance.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.153
Good game.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.988
Are-are you okay?

08:41.022 --> 08:43.991
I'm fine.
Just need a chance
to redeem myself.

08:44.025 --> 08:46.260
- Right now?
- Now's as good
a time as any.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.262
- What's the challenge?
- A footrace.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.297
You don't approve?

08:50.331 --> 08:51.932
Why does it have to be
a footrace?

08:51.966 --> 08:54.001
Can't it be like--
like trivia or something?

08:54.035 --> 08:55.336
I'm much better at trivia.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.005
You guys know that I can't
beat you guys in a race.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.807
Then, you can stand
at the finish line.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.643
I'll be inside.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.314
Alex, wait!
Alex, don't be like that!

09:09.150 --> 09:11.052
She'll be fine.
She just needs to learn

09:11.085 --> 09:12.620
that not everything
is about her.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.356
She can't control her age.
You were ten once, too.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.893
I'd trade entrance exams
for losing a race any day.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.813
This is the finish line!

10:46.814 --> 10:48.315
Ready...

10:58.826 --> 10:59.994
Set...

11:05.733 --> 11:06.867
Go!

11:36.197 --> 11:37.431
Nice save.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.034
- What happened?
- How did you react so fast?

11:40.067 --> 11:43.103
Uh, so no winner
for this challenge.
Call it a draw?

11:43.137 --> 11:45.439
Uh, I guess so.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.374
Um, maybe we
should go find Alex.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.110
Yep.

12:54.509 --> 12:56.377
Wow.

13:01.415 --> 13:05.152
- What a silly question!
- You know what I mean.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.455
Yeah, we didn't exactly have
the most conventional childhood.

13:08.489 --> 13:11.892
And yet you still have
all of your fingers
and all of your toes.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.161
- And lots of character.
- We're leaving the girls
with you.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.398
We trust you, but you don't
exactly discourage
perilous activities.

13:17.431 --> 13:19.534
- What, what--
- Scraped knees and bruises
are one thing,

13:19.567 --> 13:22.336
but just look at what you
have in this room alone.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.238
I think it's safer
that I have them in here

13:24.271 --> 13:26.273
rather than the alternative,
don't you agree?

13:26.307 --> 13:28.576
Besides, no one's allowed
in my office.

13:28.610 --> 13:31.378
Oh, I think Alyssa
is just worried

13:31.412 --> 13:33.113
about the things
you don't have control over.

13:33.147 --> 13:36.016
- Like when Sybil was young.
- That was taken care of.

13:36.050 --> 13:39.053
- You helped me
take care of it.
- Oh, I remember, Dad.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.988
Okay, we just want you
to remember that, yes,

13:41.021 --> 13:44.491
they are smart and clever,
but they are still young.

13:44.526 --> 13:47.494
They're gonna try to get in
enough trouble on their own.

13:47.529 --> 13:51.432
I shan't underestimate them.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.939
Oh, time to go.
You better go get your bags.

14:10.084 --> 14:13.253
Hello, little one.
It's all right.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.255
I was young, too, once.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.257
I understand the allure
of the unknown.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.261
Let me see
what you've chosen.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.099
Hmm.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.035
Oh!

14:32.373 --> 14:34.375
Ah!

14:36.443 --> 14:38.178
These are not easy books.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.481
It's okay. I'm already
at a 10th-grade reading level.

14:42.116 --> 14:46.053
I think these might be
even more advanced than that.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.354
Oh.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.892
Hmm.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.369
Maybe just one.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.439
Just this time.

15:12.413 --> 15:16.450
But you must promise me
to take care of it.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.586
This is one of the most
important books in my study,

15:18.620 --> 15:21.155
and I'd be very sad
if something were
to happen to it.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.122
Hmm?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.259
Let's go see everyone off,
shall we?

15:33.267 --> 15:37.070
Let's go! Let's go!
Time waits for no man!

15:37.104 --> 15:38.706
And the beautiful beaches
of Greece

15:38.740 --> 15:40.073
won't suntan themselves.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.042
It's a research trip, Papa.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.512
Oh, hopefully you can
mix in a little pleasure
with all that business.

15:44.546 --> 15:46.614
The country holds
a very special place
in my heart.

15:46.648 --> 15:48.482
You be safe
and look after the girls.

15:48.516 --> 15:50.652
Everyone is old enough
to take care of themselves.

15:50.685 --> 15:54.188
Still, you're the oldest.
I'm counting on you.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.524
Now, listen, it's not
about the time you spend...

15:56.558 --> 15:59.059
It's who
you spend it with.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.762
That's right.
Listen to your Papa

16:00.795 --> 16:03.197
and minimize
the funny business.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.233
Now, give your big guy
a hug.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.506
Hey. You really don't
have to drive us, Dad.

16:11.539 --> 16:14.107
Oh, nonsense. Gotta keep
these old eyes sharp.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.109
Besides, I think the girls
have earned a few hours away

16:16.143 --> 16:18.646
from their dusty old Papa.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.484
Okay.

16:26.721 --> 16:29.122
- Bye!
- Have a good trip.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.094
So, what should we
do next?

16:37.565 --> 16:39.567
Tag. You're it.

16:39.601 --> 16:41.736
- Tag.
- Hey! I'm not playing!

16:43.070 --> 16:45.372
I couldn't catch
any of you.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.542
Besides, I have
a new book to read.

17:16.504 --> 17:18.706
Where'd you get that?

17:18.740 --> 17:20.742
Papa Nickolaou.

17:20.775 --> 17:22.142
He let me borrow it.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.378
Really? From his study?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.583
Must be a cool book.

17:28.616 --> 17:31.485
It is.

17:31.519 --> 17:32.787
Take a look.

17:41.328 --> 17:45.667
So, who won the race?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.301
Uh, no one, actually.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.571
Zoey almost tripped,
so we called it a draw.

17:49.604 --> 17:51.806
So, she tripped
and you didn't win?

17:51.839 --> 17:53.675
No, I caught her.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.510
We both stopped
before the finish line.

17:55.543 --> 17:58.211
I would have blown
right by her.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
Better take your wins
when you can get them.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.484
You're probably
just used to winning
all the time.

18:04.519 --> 18:06.854
I'm sorry about before.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.526
I know you're not
as fast as us.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.494
But trust me
when I tell you

18:14.529 --> 18:18.465
that growing up is not all
it's cracked up to be.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.234
You're just saying that
because you're not
ten anymore.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.872
Do you know why I want
this year's Nickolathlon
to be the best ever?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.811
Because it's my last one.

18:29.844 --> 18:32.245
After I graduate this summer,

18:32.279 --> 18:34.616
I have to go to some
prestigious school

18:34.649 --> 18:36.651
in the middle of nowhere.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.122
Mom and Dad are already
helping me with applications.

18:45.392 --> 18:49.831
I had to be ten,
too, you know?
For a whole year.

18:49.864 --> 18:54.201
Then I suffered through 11
and survived 12.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.639
You will, too.

18:57.672 --> 18:59.907
And once it's over,

18:59.941 --> 19:02.342
you'll miss it
as much as I do.

19:02.376 --> 19:03.778
I highly doubt that.

19:04.846 --> 19:07.314
Well, we'll see.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.186
It's not
about the finish line.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.858
It's about the steps
you take to get there.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.730
I was about to send
a search party.

19:22.764 --> 19:24.231
What's that?

19:24.264 --> 19:27.200
It's a book Papa Nickolaou
let Alex borrow.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.202
From the study?

19:29.236 --> 19:32.472
- Can I see it?
- Sure. Just be careful.

19:32.507 --> 19:33.675
Of course.

19:36.911 --> 19:39.914
"The beginning is the end is..."

19:39.947 --> 19:42.650
Weird. Is that a typo?

19:42.684 --> 19:44.351
No, you're reading it wrong.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.253
As a linear sentence,
it doesn't make sense,

19:46.286 --> 19:48.656
but read it in a circle.
It's a cycle.

19:48.690 --> 19:52.359
"The beginning is the end
is the beginning is the end
is the beginning."

19:52.392 --> 19:53.895
The sentence
doesn't start or stop.

19:53.928 --> 19:54.862
Wow!

20:06.507 --> 20:08.976
It's beautiful.

20:25.526 --> 20:27.895
- Is this the manor?
- It is.

20:27.929 --> 20:29.664
Look, here's the kitchen,

20:29.697 --> 20:32.265
down here is the hallway,
and there's the study.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.902
What does <i>spatium mean?</i>

20:34.936 --> 20:37.304
Could mean a lot of things.
"Room" maybe.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.807
- Time Room.
- That makes no sense.

20:39.841 --> 20:42.309
It says "The Gate
of Space and Time".

20:42.342 --> 20:44.846
Right? That makes
so much more sense.

20:44.879 --> 20:46.413
Thanks for clearing that up.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.915
Wait.

20:47.949 --> 20:49.483
Where is the Time Room?

20:49.517 --> 20:52.019
If this the study,
and this is the drawing room,

20:52.053 --> 20:55.322
then there's no physical space
for this room to exist.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.390
Did they tear it out?
Renovate?

20:57.424 --> 21:00.360
No way. There isn't even
a closet where it should be.

21:10.872 --> 21:12.673
This is it.

21:12.707 --> 21:16.476
Hmm. Well, I'm fascinated
to see where this leads.

21:16.511 --> 21:19.981
It's physically impossible
to put another room
where you're standing.

21:20.014 --> 21:21.414
What does the paper say?

21:23.117 --> 21:25.953
"How oft Time's hands
join half a day,

21:25.987 --> 21:28.890
this age The Four
will make their way."

21:28.923 --> 21:30.323
Time has hands?

21:30.357 --> 21:32.794
"With darkness drawn
and chaos mounted,

21:32.827 --> 21:35.495
a new day dawns,
though time is counted."

21:35.530 --> 21:37.497
That's just gibberish.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.868
Is this it?

21:45.907 --> 21:47.542
I've never seen this before.

21:48.876 --> 21:50.978
I-I don't understand.

21:51.012 --> 21:53.748
This... this door
can't lead anywhere.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.652
Isn't weird
that we've never
seen this before?

21:57.685 --> 22:00.021
We've been up and down
these hallways
a million times.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.692
- Whoa.
- This is impossible.

22:04.725 --> 22:06.359
Guess not.

22:07.628 --> 22:08.930
- Alex!
- What?

22:08.963 --> 22:11.398
It's just
an imaginary Time Room!

22:11.431 --> 22:12.667
What's the worse
that can happen?

22:26.681 --> 22:29.684
I've never seen
anything like this.

22:40.561 --> 22:41.762
Why has no one ever told us
about this room?

22:41.796 --> 22:44.765
- What if nobody knows about it?
- Well, someone made that map.

22:44.799 --> 22:46.534
What does it say
to do next?

22:46.567 --> 22:48.401
Um...

22:48.435 --> 22:50.504
nothing. There's nothing else.

22:50.538 --> 22:51.806
What about the book?

22:54.809 --> 22:55.776
Mm.

23:02.683 --> 23:04.685
I don't see anything
about a Time Room in here,

23:04.719 --> 23:07.822
but there are more maps
and pictures.

23:15.062 --> 23:18.599
Sybil, come look at this.

23:21.102 --> 23:23.504
They look like
they could be
thousands of years old.

23:23.537 --> 23:24.639
They're incredible.

23:25.907 --> 23:27.608
No, no! Fire, no!

23:34.849 --> 23:37.184
I-I just don't understand.

23:37.218 --> 23:40.054
Where can this room
fit inside the manor?

23:40.087 --> 23:43.958
Um, maybe it
isn't inside the manor.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.794
Close the door, Zoey.

23:49.096 --> 23:53.500
- What did you see out there?
- Uh, it-- it was a--
a forest with, uh--

23:53.534 --> 23:55.803
- And you?
- It's a magical forest.

23:57.004 --> 23:59.006
Okay. Okay.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.841
Uh, open the door again,
would you, Zoey?

24:03.077 --> 24:04.145
Close it.

24:07.014 --> 24:09.050
All right. Okay.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.619
Is there another door
in here somewhere?

24:12.954 --> 24:14.555
Right.

24:14.588 --> 24:15.389
Alex!

24:15.423 --> 24:18.059
It's fine! It's just
a magical forest!

24:19.894 --> 24:20.995
Zoey!

24:22.296 --> 24:23.864
All right, well,

24:23.898 --> 24:26.167
this is the only door in or out
of this room,

24:26.200 --> 24:29.236
and it seems this room
is no longer
inside the manor.

24:29.270 --> 24:31.739
So, I think we have
to leave this room

24:31.772 --> 24:34.542
in order to find
the manor.

24:34.575 --> 24:36.911
We have to go out
in order to come back in.

24:52.026 --> 24:53.527
Girls?

25:12.680 --> 25:14.248
It was the only way out.

25:14.281 --> 25:16.517
We'll be all right
as long as we stick
together.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.527
Yes!

26:00.661 --> 26:02.663
We're nowhere near the manor.

26:09.870 --> 26:11.605
Uh, um...

26:13.207 --> 26:14.742
Do you recognize something?

26:14.775 --> 26:19.013
I wouldn't say recognize,
but I think it's a door.

26:20.881 --> 26:23.150
A door? Where?

26:23.184 --> 26:25.586
It does look like a door.

26:50.311 --> 26:52.012
And so it begins.

26:54.682 --> 26:56.917
Where's the doorknob?

26:56.951 --> 26:59.887
There is no doorknob.
Just a keyhole.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.724
If you get that open
and just jump in there
all willy-nilly, I swear--

27:03.757 --> 27:05.392
Hey, guys,
look at this.

27:09.697 --> 27:11.699
If it's in the book, maybe
it can help us get home.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.301
Over here.

27:16.704 --> 27:19.006
This looks like
a piece of that tablet.

27:19.039 --> 27:21.142
But it's broken.

27:21.175 --> 27:23.077
Fan out and search
for other pieces.

27:40.928 --> 27:42.062
I found one!

27:42.096 --> 27:43.764
Me, too!

27:48.169 --> 27:50.037
Let's see how these
fit together.

27:50.070 --> 27:54.241
Okay, Zoey, yours is,
like-like,
at the bottom.

27:54.275 --> 27:56.810
Maybe, like, rotate it.

27:56.844 --> 28:01.215
Uh, no. Okay, Sybil,
yours is, like, at the top.

28:01.248 --> 28:03.817
No, put it, like,
at the other top.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.386
Okay, wait. I just...

28:05.419 --> 28:08.055
Zoey and Sybil,
seriously, get it together!

28:08.088 --> 28:10.891
Would you like to try?

28:10.925 --> 28:13.127
Turn your piece again
just one more time,

28:13.160 --> 28:16.330
counterclockwise instead.
Yes. Perfect.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.234
That just leaves this one.

28:51.365 --> 28:53.167
Stay back!

28:54.536 --> 28:57.805
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Careful, Zoey.

28:59.273 --> 29:01.075
Take it easy!

29:03.877 --> 29:05.346
Nice.

29:05.379 --> 29:08.449
- Ow! That's it!
- Hey, Zoey, look at him.

29:08.482 --> 29:11.085
- He's just scared.
- Scared?

29:11.118 --> 29:13.487
Agot is never scared!

29:13.521 --> 29:16.223
Agot...
What is this?

29:16.257 --> 29:20.861
Not daemon or pixie.
Those faces...

29:20.894 --> 29:22.096
What are you?

29:22.129 --> 29:24.532
We're just... people.

29:25.966 --> 29:29.136
People? People.

29:29.169 --> 29:31.438
Human people?

29:31.472 --> 29:32.840
And that book?

29:32.873 --> 29:35.109
She likes to read.

29:35.142 --> 29:37.378
You really don't know
where you are?

29:39.847 --> 29:43.350
This is the Forest
of Forgotten Thoughts.

29:43.384 --> 29:46.353
It's where people
are sent to be... well...

29:46.387 --> 29:47.454
Forgotten?

29:47.488 --> 29:48.956
But who would wanna
forget you?

29:48.989 --> 29:51.325
Most things
are forgotten eventually.

29:51.358 --> 29:54.895
Forgive me.
Isolation has dulled my senses.

29:54.928 --> 29:56.463
I did not recognize you.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.999
I am Agot,

29:59.033 --> 30:03.203
humble servant
and Protector of the Passage.

30:03.237 --> 30:05.072
And who do you think we are?

30:05.105 --> 30:07.341
This is the Eleventh Age,

30:07.374 --> 30:10.978
which means you
are The Warriors Four,

30:11.011 --> 30:13.414
the Guardians of Time.

30:13.447 --> 30:16.317
And you're the Protector
of the Passage?

30:16.350 --> 30:17.885
Wherever you'd like to go,

30:17.918 --> 30:20.154
and whenever you'd like
to be there.

30:20.187 --> 30:21.523
Can you help us open it?

30:21.556 --> 30:23.558
I cannot.

30:23.591 --> 30:25.893
Listen, we're not
who you think we are.

30:25.926 --> 30:28.395
We just came here by mistake
and we just wanna go home.

30:28.429 --> 30:31.231
You are the Guardians of Time,
it's undeniable,

30:31.265 --> 30:33.601
but regardless,
I cannot open the passage,

30:33.635 --> 30:36.604
because I do not have
the Tempus Key.

30:36.638 --> 30:40.240
- Well, where is it?
- It was disassembled long ago.

30:40.274 --> 30:41.909
Is there no other way
to open it?

30:41.942 --> 30:44.378
The Tempus Key
is the only way.

30:44.411 --> 30:46.146
Otherwise,
it's just a door.

30:46.180 --> 30:50.017
But why is the door here
in the middle of
a forgotten forest?

30:50.050 --> 30:51.885
To protect it,
of course.

30:51.919 --> 30:54.254
Do you know
how much power that is?

30:54.288 --> 30:57.559
The ability
to go anywhere, anytime?

30:57.592 --> 31:00.994
I could read the scrolls
in the lost Library
of Alexandria.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.296
You'd have to know Latin.

31:03.297 --> 31:05.265
I can learn Latin
and then read the scrolls

31:05.299 --> 31:08.168
in the lost Library
of Alexandria!

31:08.202 --> 31:10.270
Or we could return home.

31:10.304 --> 31:12.674
So, to get back,

31:12.707 --> 31:15.008
we have to go through
a locked door,

31:15.042 --> 31:18.646
and to unlock it,
we have to find
a broken key?

31:18.680 --> 31:21.148
Not broken. Disassembled.

31:21.181 --> 31:25.219
All you need to do is gather
the three Crystals of Time
to reassemble--

31:35.996 --> 31:38.332
Someone must know
you're here.

31:52.714 --> 31:54.314
It can teleport?

31:54.348 --> 31:56.083
Time works strangely here.

31:56.116 --> 31:59.319
Some creatures can
manipulate it in subtle ways.

32:19.541 --> 32:21.008
Are you okay?

32:26.079 --> 32:27.347
Alex!

33:17.832 --> 33:20.133
- Sybil, we have to run!
- But Alex--

33:20.167 --> 33:21.468
Sybil, now!

33:53.568 --> 33:54.669
Good riddance!

33:55.670 --> 33:57.471
What happened?

33:58.773 --> 34:01.341
- Are you hurt?
- Poison branches.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.378
I'll be all right if we can
stop the infection in time.

34:06.714 --> 34:08.115
How we do that?

34:08.148 --> 34:12.219
Greya, an old friend.

34:12.252 --> 34:13.387
She can help.

34:14.388 --> 34:15.857
Where are the others?

34:15.890 --> 34:18.458
Far from here.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.361
I'll help you get there.

34:21.395 --> 34:26.166
And I shall help you reunite
with the other Guardians.

34:32.907 --> 34:34.809
There! I see
a break in the woods!

34:56.163 --> 34:57.565
Well done,
Shadow.

35:02.670 --> 35:05.305
The Treefolk are not
usually aggressive creatures.

35:05.339 --> 35:07.240
But they can be
controlled with magic.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.409
You must have angered
someone very powerful.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.612
We didn't do anything.

35:10.645 --> 35:12.680
We were just trying to find
a way out when they attacked us.

35:12.714 --> 35:14.381
- They?
- Yeah, there were two--

35:14.414 --> 35:16.818
- Alex.
- No, you can't go back
in there.

35:16.851 --> 35:18.620
- It's too dangerous.
- I don't care, Theo!

35:18.653 --> 35:21.789
- I can't just leave her
there with--
- With Agot.

35:21.823 --> 35:23.825
He knows what he's doing
far better than we do.

35:23.858 --> 35:25.693
And they could be anywhere.

35:25.727 --> 35:27.762
Who knows how far
that thing teleported them?

35:27.795 --> 35:30.798
You lost a member
of your party?

35:30.832 --> 35:32.900
Yes. My sister.

35:36.804 --> 35:40.708
Shadow has her scent now.
He will find your sister.

35:42.844 --> 35:43.945
What brings you to Kairos?

35:43.978 --> 35:45.546
Is that what
this place is called?

35:45.580 --> 35:47.582
You don't know
where you are?

35:47.615 --> 35:49.282
We didn't mean to come here.

35:49.316 --> 35:52.553
We entered this world
through a door
that doesn't exist

35:52.587 --> 35:56.858
in a room
that doesn't exist
in our grandpa's house.

35:56.891 --> 36:00.260
We're hoping
if we find the Tempus Key,
then we can get back home.

36:00.293 --> 36:01.562
The Tempus Key?

36:02.797 --> 36:04.766
But that means...

36:06.567 --> 36:09.169
I apologize for not
recognizing you sooner.

36:10.672 --> 36:12.573
You're the Warriors Four.

36:12.607 --> 36:14.609
The Guardians of Time.

36:14.642 --> 36:16.678
That's us, I guess.

36:16.711 --> 36:18.646
I am Pamphilos,

36:18.680 --> 36:20.848
former soldier
of the Atlantean Guard.

36:22.917 --> 36:27.220
Uh, well, I'm Sybil.
That's Theo and Zoey.

36:28.756 --> 36:32.927
Zoey? I've never heard a name
like that before.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.195
I've never heard a name
like Pamphilos.

36:36.798 --> 36:39.366
Well, welcome to Kairos,

36:39.399 --> 36:42.904
world between worlds
from which time itself springs.

36:42.937 --> 36:45.405
Last line of defense
against Kronos

36:45.439 --> 36:48.710
and home to all
who have been lost to time.

36:48.743 --> 36:51.713
Lost to time? Is that where the
dinosaur
came from?

36:51.746 --> 36:53.781
Indeed, it is.

36:53.815 --> 36:56.617
Shadow and I were not always
travel companions.

36:56.651 --> 36:59.654
But we met each other here,
fellow outcasts.

36:59.687 --> 37:03.256
I am honored
to be in your presence.

37:03.290 --> 37:06.527
Permit me to accompany you
in your journey.

37:06.561 --> 37:11.699
I pledge my fealty
and swear to give my all
to fulfill the prophecy.

37:11.733 --> 37:13.000
Prophecy?

37:13.034 --> 37:16.303
"How oft Time's hands
join half a day,

37:16.336 --> 37:18.706
this age The Four
will make their way."

37:18.740 --> 37:20.041
How do you know that rhyme?

37:20.074 --> 37:21.809
I've heard it
since I was a child.

37:21.843 --> 37:23.511
Everyone has.

37:23.544 --> 37:26.279
The foretelling of the arrival
of The Warriors Four

37:26.313 --> 37:27.849
to lift the curse
and take their place

37:27.882 --> 37:29.449
as the Guardians of Time.

37:29.483 --> 37:34.354
Okay. I think we're gonna
need an explanation about this
whole guardian thing

37:34.387 --> 37:35.890
if everyone's gonna keep
bringing it up.

37:36.958 --> 37:40.795
Pamphilos, could you explain
to us what you've just said

37:40.828 --> 37:43.765
as though we've never
heard any of it before?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.334
I see.

37:49.904 --> 37:51.706
- Follow me.
- One second.

37:53.741 --> 37:55.910
We are about to follow
a mysterious stranger

37:55.943 --> 37:57.545
off into the wilderness.

37:57.578 --> 38:00.782
- He seems nice.
- Nice doesn't mean safe.

38:00.815 --> 38:03.518
We are also
effectively giving up on Alex

38:03.551 --> 38:06.621
- and hoping she's okay.
- We are not giving up.

38:06.654 --> 38:09.422
With or without Alex,
we can't get home
without the Crystals.

38:11.358 --> 38:14.294
Okay. I just wanted
to make sure we were committed
to this.

38:16.063 --> 38:20.500
Next challenge of the annual
Nickolathlon-- find Alex.

38:20.535 --> 38:21.702
Find Alex.

38:29.844 --> 38:36.117
You have shown me
great kindness,
strength, and bravery.

38:36.150 --> 38:39.821
Are these attributes
part of your powers
as a Guardian?

38:41.889 --> 38:43.891
I don't have any powers.

38:43.925 --> 38:46.894
Perhaps you do not see.
But I--

38:49.263 --> 38:51.132
Will your friend know
what to do?

38:51.165 --> 38:55.036
Greya is an incredibly
powerful sorceress.

38:55.069 --> 38:56.671
Is she nice?

38:57.672 --> 39:00.575
She is... wise.

39:06.981 --> 39:08.816
Hello.

39:17.758 --> 39:20.695
He needs your help!
We don't have much time!

39:20.728 --> 39:23.164
Time is not
kind to all.

39:23.197 --> 39:26.801
Indeed there are those
who would prefer
its dissolution.

39:33.140 --> 39:37.645
It appears time
has been less kind to me
than it has to you.

39:37.678 --> 39:41.782
You may not recognize
your humble compatriot Agot,

39:41.816 --> 39:43.985
at your service.

39:44.018 --> 39:47.989
Agot. Always good
to see a friend.

39:49.757 --> 39:52.159
Your venom
is spreading. Come.

39:59.533 --> 40:01.535
Is he gonna be okay?

40:01.569 --> 40:04.639
In time.
And with the right care.

40:05.706 --> 40:08.109
What brings you
so far from home,
little one?

40:08.142 --> 40:10.177
How do you know
I don't live out here?

40:10.211 --> 40:11.979
You wear
your feelings
like a veil.

40:13.781 --> 40:16.884
And nothing lives out here,
they've made sure of that.

40:40.107 --> 40:42.677
Thank you, old friend.

40:44.645 --> 40:46.914
Rest now.
Let it run its course.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.817
What do you mean,
nothing lives out here?

40:49.850 --> 40:52.520
Agot and I share
an unfortunate history.

40:53.854 --> 40:56.223
The same people
who imprisoned him

40:56.257 --> 41:01.762
banished me
to live out my days
in this cursed place.

41:01.796 --> 41:05.533
Crops cannot grow
in this soil,

41:05.566 --> 41:08.235
and no living thing
comes within miles.

41:08.269 --> 41:09.737
Who would do this to you?

41:09.770 --> 41:11.839
They're gone now.

41:13.207 --> 41:15.142
But their presence echoes.

41:15.176 --> 41:18.079
The Crystals
could restore order.

41:18.112 --> 41:20.214
Right these wrongs.

41:20.247 --> 41:21.949
Is that why
you've come this way?

41:21.983 --> 41:23.584
The Temple of Chronoception?

41:25.119 --> 41:27.922
But without a Guardian of Time,
you won't be able to--

41:33.828 --> 41:34.729
I see.

41:34.762 --> 41:38.532
Chronoception.
I think I read about that.

41:50.344 --> 41:54.715
The Age of Gods rose and fell,
but the Titans remained.

41:54.749 --> 41:58.019
The ruthless Titan Kronos
was trapped in the outer realm,

41:58.052 --> 42:02.556
but the Titan Prometheus
found mankind
noble and beautiful,

42:02.590 --> 42:03.958
and chose to live among them.

42:03.991 --> 42:08.295
He fell in love, married,
had children, and grandchildren.

42:08.329 --> 42:10.297
All the while,
his brother, Kronos,

42:10.331 --> 42:12.900
plotted to undo reality
as we know it,

42:12.933 --> 42:16.237
return this realm
into a timeless, spaceless void

42:16.270 --> 42:18.572
where he can rule once more.

42:18.606 --> 42:22.910
Kairos is the frontline
of conflict eons in the making,

42:22.943 --> 42:26.881
and in the Eleventh Age,
prophecy tells of four warriors

42:26.914 --> 42:30.718
who will lead us to victory
as the Guardians of Time.

42:30.751 --> 42:33.254
And you think we
are those warriors,

42:33.287 --> 42:36.857
the... Guardians.

42:50.671 --> 42:52.006
We're almost there.

42:57.845 --> 42:59.080
Hold on!

43:01.882 --> 43:05.152
So we're trapped
in the Bermuda Triangle of time

43:05.186 --> 43:07.721
and Papa Nickolaou
is supposed to be a Greek god?

43:07.755 --> 43:09.957
That's right,
if I understood
the story correctly.

43:09.990 --> 43:13.094
This is ridiculous.
I barely made it
through midterms.

43:13.127 --> 43:16.363
I don't think I'm ready
for a save-the-universe
level of responsibility.

43:16.397 --> 43:18.732
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

43:18.766 --> 43:22.937
First, we have to reassemble
the Tempus Key and find Alex.

43:22.970 --> 43:27.241
If Papa Nickolaou
is who you say he is,
he'll know what to do.

43:27.274 --> 43:29.910
Do you know anything
about the Crystals of Time?

43:29.944 --> 43:33.080
There are three:
The Crystal of Chronoception,

43:33.114 --> 43:36.283
the Crystal of Chronometry,
and the Crystal of Chronology.

43:36.317 --> 43:39.854
They're hidden deep inside
three unique temples,

43:39.887 --> 43:42.356
and that's how you'll know
what I'm saying is true.

43:42.389 --> 43:43.457
What do you mean?

43:43.491 --> 43:47.061
Only the descendant of a Titan
can enter each temple.

43:47.094 --> 43:49.029
I know you must have
many questions,

43:49.063 --> 43:51.832
but when your feet touch
the floor of the temple,

43:51.866 --> 43:55.402
there's no denying
that the blood of Titans
flows through your veins.

43:55.436 --> 43:57.771
Is that where you're
taking us now?

43:57.805 --> 43:59.306
Not yet.

44:08.282 --> 44:10.718
I don't know what you'll face
in the Temples of Time,

44:10.751 --> 44:13.187
so you need to be
prepared for anything.

44:13.220 --> 44:15.890
- Is this Avalon?
- What's left of it.

44:15.923 --> 44:17.791
Yeah, as in King Arthur
and the...

44:19.927 --> 44:21.929
Knights of the Round Table.

44:22.997 --> 44:26.233
It's so well maintained
compared to the rest
of the castle.

44:26.267 --> 44:28.769
A few fellow soldiers
and I

44:28.802 --> 44:30.237
preserved and protected
this location

44:30.271 --> 44:31.438
before the Dark Times.

44:31.472 --> 44:33.741
After the First Great War,

44:33.774 --> 44:36.443
I started hiding caches
in various locations

44:36.477 --> 44:37.912
should the need arise.

44:48.989 --> 44:51.725
I will help you
focus the magic,

44:51.759 --> 44:53.994
but you must
envision your weapon.

44:55.462 --> 44:58.165
Focus your energy.

44:58.199 --> 45:00.935
See yourself
fighting confidently

45:00.968 --> 45:04.972
to protect what you love
and make it reality.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.201
That was incredible.

45:34.235 --> 45:37.037
You did beautifully.
Who's next?

46:16.143 --> 46:18.078
I see this view
so often every day,

46:18.112 --> 46:20.314
I sometimes forget
how beautiful it is.

46:25.853 --> 46:26.987
What troubles you?

46:28.523 --> 46:31.892
Agot says the Temple
of Chronoception
is near here.

46:33.327 --> 46:37.498
I should be brave,
like he says.

46:40.267 --> 46:41.935
But I'm afraid...

46:44.338 --> 46:45.839
without them.

46:46.641 --> 46:49.511
I've always thought
I would be
this great explorer.

46:52.046 --> 46:54.381
But I'm just scared
and lonely.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.585
I want Sybil.

47:03.324 --> 47:04.892
I want to show you
something.

47:09.963 --> 47:13.467
Wow. It's beautiful.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.870
When I was banished here,
I used this to feel
less alone.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.609
Look here.

47:22.976 --> 47:24.445
Relax.

47:24.478 --> 47:26.947
The glass responds
to your heart.

47:37.224 --> 47:38.225
Whoa.

47:40.194 --> 47:41.563
Is that what I think it is?

47:41.596 --> 47:44.264
Perhaps.
What do you think it is?

47:44.298 --> 47:47.935
Amelia Earhart's plane!
The one she disappeared in!

47:47.968 --> 47:49.336
She and her navigator!

47:49.370 --> 47:50.572
I do not recall the name,

47:50.605 --> 47:52.574
but I do believe
it was a female pilot.

47:52.607 --> 47:55.075
Wait, is this here?

47:55.109 --> 47:58.145
Everything you see
in this looking glass
is somewhere in Kairos.

47:58.178 --> 48:01.382
So... she didn't crash.

48:01.415 --> 48:06.253
She landed here, safely,
lost to time.

48:06.286 --> 48:10.224
This was many years ago.
She's with the Atlanteans now.

48:10.257 --> 48:14.128
Atlanteans?
Like the city of Atlantis?

48:16.698 --> 48:19.032
Can we go there?
I'd love to see it!

48:19.066 --> 48:21.703
The Atlanteans
are not a welcoming people,

48:21.736 --> 48:25.939
- particularly
to creatures like me.
- You're okay!

48:25.973 --> 48:27.074
How are you feeling?

48:27.107 --> 48:29.042
Much better, thank you.

48:29.076 --> 48:31.078
So, what do you mean,
not like you?

48:31.111 --> 48:33.013
I am a "less than--"

48:33.046 --> 48:36.551
less than tall,
less than fast,
less than smart.

48:38.553 --> 48:40.187
I know how that feels.

48:40.220 --> 48:43.490
How could you?
You are less than no one.

48:43.525 --> 48:46.093
You are a Guardian of Time.

48:46.126 --> 48:48.295
Not back at home.

48:48.328 --> 48:51.064
I'm just a little sister
who can't keep up.

48:56.003 --> 48:58.338
What? What...

48:59.239 --> 49:01.475
What are they doing?
They're not even
looking for me!

49:04.344 --> 49:08.382
- And who is that boy?
- He looks like a member
of the Atlantean Guard.

49:08.415 --> 49:11.318
The images in the looking glass
are not always what they seem.

49:11.351 --> 49:13.387
I'm sure they didn't
mean to replace you.

49:15.189 --> 49:17.659
Take me to the Temple
of Chronoception.

49:26.300 --> 49:28.068
We should be close.

49:40.047 --> 49:42.550
All right,
let's go.

49:45.252 --> 49:47.755
Unfortunately,
I cannot join you inside.

49:47.789 --> 49:51.391
Only a Guardian
may set foot
inside the temple.

49:51.425 --> 49:55.329
For me, it is
a simple archway.

49:55.362 --> 49:57.231
But I can't do it alone.

49:57.264 --> 50:00.467
As I have said
before, you <i>can.</i>

50:00.501 --> 50:03.136
You were born
to hold the Crystals.

50:03.170 --> 50:06.541
The Tempus Key
is rightfully yours to wield.

50:06.574 --> 50:11.513
Nothing inside the temple
can defeat a Guardian of Time.

50:11.546 --> 50:15.148
I don't feel like
a Guardian of Time.

50:15.182 --> 50:19.521
Possessing the Crystal itself
may unlock your powers.

50:25.727 --> 50:28.696
Okay. Here goes nothing.

52:03.591 --> 52:04.892
"Chronoception.

52:04.926 --> 52:07.227
The perception
of the speed of time

52:07.260 --> 52:09.129
both forward and backward."

54:33.473 --> 54:35.308
You retrieved the Crystal?

54:35.342 --> 54:37.945
- Yes, I have it here.
- And your powers?

54:40.014 --> 54:42.415
I think you might be
wrong about those.

54:42.449 --> 54:44.417
I don't feel any different.

54:44.451 --> 54:47.655
We shall see.
Have you used it yet?

54:47.688 --> 54:49.322
Used it?

54:49.356 --> 54:52.860
Yes, the Crystals hold
the powers of Time
within them.

54:52.894 --> 54:55.462
So... what do they do?

54:55.495 --> 54:58.099
The others affect
the nature of time
around you,

54:58.132 --> 55:00.902
but this is the Crystal
of Chronoception.

55:00.935 --> 55:03.905
It affects the way
time moves through you.

55:05.472 --> 55:07.875
Sounds like I have
to do some homework.

55:24.457 --> 55:26.894
Pamphilos,
can I ask you something?

55:26.928 --> 55:28.629
Of course.

55:28.663 --> 55:30.965
In the woods,
something strange happened.

55:30.998 --> 55:33.701
- With the vine giant.
- Strange?

55:33.734 --> 55:37.370
Yeah, time stopped.
It just froze, kind of.

55:37.404 --> 55:38.573
The giant
was about to crush me,

55:38.606 --> 55:42.009
but then it was frozen and I was
able
to get out of the way.

55:42.043 --> 55:43.511
Is that normal?

55:43.544 --> 55:46.013
Does that happen
a lot around here?

55:46.047 --> 55:49.617
There are some with the ability
to manipulate time
in small ways.

55:49.650 --> 55:51.586
Like the Treeback
you encountered.

55:51.619 --> 55:55.723
But to stop time completely,
that is a very powerful feat.

55:55.756 --> 55:57.992
It must be your powers
manifesting.

55:58.025 --> 56:01.461
- Powers?
- Ah, yes.

56:01.494 --> 56:02.930
You wouldn't
have heard of this.

56:02.964 --> 56:06.033
The Guardians of Time
each have a special gift.

56:06.067 --> 56:08.435
It is their birthright.

56:08.468 --> 56:10.403
It comes from
your Titan lineage.

56:10.437 --> 56:12.506
It will take some time
to develop naturally,

56:12.540 --> 56:15.076
but will be of great help
to you in your journey.

56:15.109 --> 56:17.678
I haven't experienced
anything like that.

56:17.712 --> 56:19.647
Is there something
we can do to unlock it?

56:19.680 --> 56:23.985
There are ways, but it's best
to let it happen naturally.

56:24.018 --> 56:26.787
Your powers will come to you
when you need them.

56:26.821 --> 56:29.790
It's important to be ready
for something like this.

56:29.824 --> 56:32.927
Too much power too fast
can be a burden to carry

56:32.960 --> 56:35.763
rather than a strength
to wield.

56:35.796 --> 56:37.798
Come, we are
almost there.

56:50.077 --> 56:51.646
This is it?

56:51.679 --> 56:54.148
- It's just an arch.
- To everyone else.

56:54.181 --> 56:58.185
But to you, this is
the Temple of Chronometry.

56:58.219 --> 57:01.722
Chronometry?
As in the measurement of time?

57:01.756 --> 57:05.526
Yes. Time moves
in a measured,
ordered fashion.

57:05.559 --> 57:07.161
But that was not
always the case.

57:07.194 --> 57:09.964
Kronos's universe
was one of chaos.

57:09.997 --> 57:11.732
There was
no temporal order.

57:14.702 --> 57:15.970
Okay.

57:16.003 --> 57:18.940
- You sure about this?
- Not even a little bit.

57:18.973 --> 57:22.777
But if it means
getting closer
to finding Alex,

57:22.810 --> 57:24.145
it'll be worth it.

57:55.943 --> 57:57.144
Are you okay?

57:58.980 --> 58:01.983
Yeah. I'm-I'm just
getting a headache.

58:18.933 --> 58:21.869
"Two bodies have I,
though both joined as one.

58:21.902 --> 58:25.773
The more I stand still,
the faster I run."

58:25.806 --> 58:27.241
What?

58:27.274 --> 58:29.276
An hourglass.

58:34.849 --> 58:36.117
Wait, this is timed?

58:36.150 --> 58:38.019
What happens if we don't
figure it out in time?

58:38.052 --> 58:39.286
Let's not find out.

58:39.320 --> 58:40.955
An hourglass...

58:40.988 --> 58:42.990
There was an hourglass
at the entrance.

58:43.024 --> 58:44.592
Are you okay?

58:44.625 --> 58:46.961
No. Something's wrong.

58:47.895 --> 58:50.231
- It's in my head.
- What do you mean
"in your head"?

58:50.264 --> 58:52.033
The book. The pages
I looked at,

58:52.066 --> 58:53.968
I can remember
them all exactly.

58:54.001 --> 58:56.003
Every picture
and every word.

58:56.937 --> 59:00.241
I remember what you
had for breakfast
last Sunday morning.

59:00.274 --> 59:03.010
Eggs on toast, over-easy,
with two squirts of hot sauce.

59:03.044 --> 59:04.912
Mom had a breakfast burrito
with green pepper,

59:04.945 --> 59:07.648
and Dad had leftover pizza
from the night before,

59:07.681 --> 59:10.251
half pepperoni
and half pineapple.

59:10.284 --> 59:12.186
I remember everything.

59:12.219 --> 59:16.123
I mean, it's a weird thing
to remember, but it's
hardly everything.

59:16.157 --> 59:19.026
No. I mean everything.

59:19.060 --> 59:22.329
I remember
that you're on page 235
of the book you're reading.

59:22.363 --> 59:24.999
Your bookmark, it's--
it's blue with gold dots.

59:25.032 --> 59:28.335
When I was five,
we hid painted rocks
in the woods behind the manor.

59:28.369 --> 59:29.937
When we went
back to find them again,

59:29.970 --> 59:31.605
we couldn't remember
where we had put them,

59:31.639 --> 59:33.774
but I remember now.

59:34.775 --> 59:36.610
I remember everything.

59:46.053 --> 59:47.822
Just breathe, Theo.

59:47.855 --> 59:50.658
You're okay. Just breathe.

59:50.691 --> 59:52.259
Clear your mind.

59:56.730 --> 1:00:00.768
I'm okay. It's just
a lot to process.

1:00:00.801 --> 1:00:03.304
I suddenly have
all these memories
swimming around in my brain.

1:00:03.337 --> 1:00:06.774
It's like I'm still there
hiding the rocks,

1:00:06.807 --> 1:00:08.142
or at breakfast.

1:00:09.810 --> 1:00:13.280
I can see it all in
perfect detail, but...

1:00:15.416 --> 1:00:17.751
If I don't think about it...

1:00:19.787 --> 1:00:22.123
I think having powers
might not be all
it's cracked up to be.

1:00:26.393 --> 1:00:29.063
- I know what to do.
- You sure?

1:00:29.096 --> 1:00:31.365
It's in the book.
I can see it like
it's right in front of me.

1:00:38.272 --> 1:00:42.076
That hourglass,
the one with the red sand,
turn it over on the altar.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:00.995
Look!

1:01:04.498 --> 1:01:07.935
You did it.
I knew you would.

1:01:07.968 --> 1:01:09.370
I'm glad one of us did.

1:01:10.804 --> 1:01:13.040
Come, we need
to find shelter.

1:01:13.073 --> 1:01:15.976
We don't wanna be travelling
when the darkness rolls in.

1:01:16.010 --> 1:01:17.778
The darkness?

1:01:44.972 --> 1:01:47.775
We'll use these stones
to channel ancient magic

1:01:47.808 --> 1:01:50.945
to create a barrier
stronger than any physical one
we could build.

1:01:50.978 --> 1:01:52.479
I hope you don't
think me ungrateful,

1:01:52.514 --> 1:01:54.148
but why are you helping us?

1:01:55.816 --> 1:01:58.185
I know this must be very new
to you and the others,

1:01:58.219 --> 1:02:01.989
but to me, this is the most
important conflict
of all time,

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:04.391
the only conflict
that matters.

1:02:04.425 --> 1:02:08.295
And if I can contribute
to the victory of good
in any meaningful way,

1:02:08.329 --> 1:02:12.333
then it is my solemn duty
and distinct honor
to do just that.

1:02:16.103 --> 1:02:18.772
I also enjoy
your company
considerably.

1:02:20.975 --> 1:02:24.411
Um, the symbols
on those stones,
what do they mean?

1:02:24.445 --> 1:02:26.847
It's an ancient
Atlantean dialect.

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:30.217
The key to harnessing
the magic of nature herself.

1:02:37.958 --> 1:02:40.394
How much time do we have?

1:02:40.427 --> 1:02:42.863
Enough.

1:02:42.896 --> 1:02:45.032
What is it?

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:48.869
The high servant of Kronos
once led an army of dark forces

1:02:48.902 --> 1:02:51.105
in an effort
to free the old Titan

1:02:51.138 --> 1:02:54.074
and shred the fabric
of time and space.

1:02:54.108 --> 1:02:56.176
His name was Deimos.

1:02:56.210 --> 1:02:58.078
I fought alongside
the armies of Atlantis,

1:02:58.112 --> 1:03:01.181
and together, we defeated
and imprisoned him.

1:03:01.215 --> 1:03:04.586
That darkness
is what remains of his army,

1:03:04.619 --> 1:03:07.555
cursed to endlessly wander
in the night.

1:03:07.589 --> 1:03:10.891
Angry, violent, and hungry.

1:03:11.693 --> 1:03:14.061
We wouldn't last long
outside the circle.

1:03:14.094 --> 1:03:16.531
- What about Alex?
- Anyone who lives in Kairos

1:03:16.564 --> 1:03:18.899
knows a safe place
to go at night.

1:03:18.932 --> 1:03:20.934
I'm sure she'll be safe
with your friend.

1:03:29.511 --> 1:03:33.213
Incredible. Such power.

1:03:35.449 --> 1:03:38.085
I feel it emanating even now.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:42.456
That's the last of it.
I shall see you
on the morrow.

1:03:42.489 --> 1:03:43.991
You sure I shouldn't
come with you?

1:03:44.024 --> 1:03:46.860
Not until your powers
have fully manifested.

1:03:46.894 --> 1:03:48.563
It's too dangerous.

1:03:53.133 --> 1:03:54.636
What is it?

1:03:54.669 --> 1:03:59.273
Disorder. Chaos.
The undoing of time itself.

1:03:59.306 --> 1:04:04.211
Many creatures thrive in it.
Others are torn apart.

1:04:04.244 --> 1:04:06.914
But I thought the Crystals
restored order.

1:04:06.947 --> 1:04:10.150
- Won't it protect me?
- One of three.

1:04:10.184 --> 1:04:12.654
Stay here.
You're safe with Greya.

1:04:12.687 --> 1:04:15.889
I must go to the others
now that we know where they are.

1:04:15.923 --> 1:04:18.959
There's no time to lose.

1:04:18.992 --> 1:04:23.330
I'll be back before you know it
and you'll all be reunited.

1:04:29.804 --> 1:04:32.973
- That darkness...
- Pay it no mind, child.

1:04:33.006 --> 1:04:35.510
I know how to make
your powers manifest.

1:05:30.732 --> 1:05:32.266
Can't sleep?

1:05:34.636 --> 1:05:36.638
I have dreams sometimes.

1:05:38.138 --> 1:05:41.275
This one specific dream,
actually.

1:05:41.308 --> 1:05:43.177
A lot.

1:05:44.612 --> 1:05:49.349
I'm beginning to wonder
if it isn't really a dream.

1:05:49.383 --> 1:05:50.585
What do you mean?

1:05:52.319 --> 1:05:57.191
Doctors tell me
it's the response
to a childhood trauma,

1:05:57.224 --> 1:05:58.560
but it feels different.

1:06:00.294 --> 1:06:04.198
When I was small,
I was alone in the manor.

1:06:04.231 --> 1:06:05.600
Everyone else had gone
to a party,

1:06:05.633 --> 1:06:07.234
but I wasn't feeling well.

1:06:08.803 --> 1:06:11.606
A man broke in and ransacked
my grandfather's study.

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:14.676
I bumped into him.

1:06:17.344 --> 1:06:19.213
He frightened me.

1:06:20.548 --> 1:06:24.284
Sounds frightening.
Especially for a child.

1:06:24.318 --> 1:06:26.621
But it's more than that.
I don't just see that night.

1:06:28.388 --> 1:06:30.057
I see us as we are now.

1:06:30.090 --> 1:06:32.426
I've seen it my whole life.

1:06:32.459 --> 1:06:34.261
You've always dreamt this?

1:06:34.294 --> 1:06:37.498
As long as I can remember.

1:06:37.532 --> 1:06:41.034
Sometimes I see things
when I'm awake,

1:06:41.068 --> 1:06:44.739
like déjà vu for something
that hasn't happened yet.

1:06:44.772 --> 1:06:46.473
Visions.

1:06:47.474 --> 1:06:49.176
It's more than that.

1:06:49.209 --> 1:06:52.514
They feel like
more than memories.

1:06:52.547 --> 1:06:55.115
Like I'm actually there.

1:06:55.148 --> 1:06:57.184
It's clearer
this time, though.

1:06:59.521 --> 1:07:03.658
It's always felt
like something
was wrong with me,

1:07:03.691 --> 1:07:05.459
something to be afraid of.

1:07:10.665 --> 1:07:14.536
The impediment to action
advances action.

1:07:15.837 --> 1:07:19.373
What stands in the way
becomes the way.

1:07:21.609 --> 1:07:26.380
A gift can seem like a curse
until you find its meaning.

1:07:36.858 --> 1:07:38.526
It's so dark.

1:07:41.361 --> 1:07:43.297
This is the work of Deimos.

1:07:44.331 --> 1:07:46.266
The desire of Kronos.

1:07:47.569 --> 1:07:49.169
What we're fighting against.

1:07:50.872 --> 1:07:53.140
If we fail,

1:07:53.173 --> 1:07:57.477
the universe will fall
into darkness and disarray.

1:07:59.479 --> 1:08:01.181
Then we won't fail.

1:08:09.891 --> 1:08:12.125
What was that?

1:08:12.159 --> 1:08:14.862
The Dark Army
is very active tonight.

1:08:14.896 --> 1:08:16.531
They sense its power.

1:08:17.532 --> 1:08:20.400
Are we in danger?

1:08:20.434 --> 1:08:22.469
You retrieved this Crystal
on your own.

1:08:22.502 --> 1:08:24.706
You have nothing to fear.

1:08:24.739 --> 1:08:27.775
If that isn't
enough testament
to your power...

1:08:30.511 --> 1:08:32.780
you will soon see
what you truly are.

1:08:35.248 --> 1:08:37.384
I wish my sister
was here.

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:39.520
You don't need
your sister.

1:08:40.722 --> 1:08:42.389
Not anymore.

1:08:49.864 --> 1:08:52.232
I can't let go!

1:08:52.265 --> 1:08:54.301
Greya, please help!

1:08:54.334 --> 1:08:55.837
Ow, ow!

1:09:07.815 --> 1:09:10.918
I'm so sorry
you had to experience that.

1:09:10.952 --> 1:09:12.620
How do you feel?

1:09:14.354 --> 1:09:16.591
I-I don't know.

1:09:34.374 --> 1:09:35.777
Greya?

1:09:36.978 --> 1:09:38.278
Greya?

1:09:40.581 --> 1:09:41.883
What's that noise?

1:09:44.686 --> 1:09:46.554
No! No!

1:10:30.598 --> 1:10:33.801
Hush, child.
You're safe now.

1:10:33.835 --> 1:10:36.269
No one can hurt you
ever again.

1:10:36.303 --> 1:10:39.774
- What happened?
- Your powers.

1:10:39.807 --> 1:10:42.810
It would seem you wield
the power of Entropy.

1:10:42.844 --> 1:10:45.378
Entropy?

1:10:45.412 --> 1:10:47.682
Change over time.

1:10:47.715 --> 1:10:51.652
You hold at your fingertips
the very powers of change.

1:10:55.623 --> 1:10:58.492
Did I-- did I do this?
I'm sorry.

1:10:58.526 --> 1:11:00.293
Don't you understand?

1:11:00.327 --> 1:11:03.765
You are the most powerful
creature I've ever met,

1:11:03.798 --> 1:11:06.734
more powerful than the other
three Guardians combined.

1:11:06.768 --> 1:11:09.402
- What?
- Yes.

1:11:09.436 --> 1:11:11.639
Judging by the sigils
on their armor--

1:11:11.672 --> 1:11:13.641
Hindsight, Presence,
and Foresight--

1:11:13.674 --> 1:11:17.879
they each wield one component
of past, present, and future.

1:11:17.912 --> 1:11:19.580
But you...

1:11:19.614 --> 1:11:23.551
you wield the power
of all three at once.

1:11:30.958 --> 1:11:34.061
Rest now.
Recover.

1:11:35.930 --> 1:11:37.865
And when you wake,

1:11:37.899 --> 1:11:41.334
take your rightful place
as a Guardian of Time.

1:12:06.661 --> 1:12:08.729
We aren't far
from the Temple of Chronology.

1:12:08.763 --> 1:12:10.531
We should easily
arrive there by midday.

1:12:10.565 --> 1:12:13.568
- That's great news.
- Splendid news, indeed!

1:12:13.601 --> 1:12:15.402
- Agot!
- State your business, traveler.

1:12:15.435 --> 1:12:16.938
I see you have company.

1:12:16.971 --> 1:12:18.840
- Where's Alex? Is she safe?
- You know him?

1:12:18.873 --> 1:12:21.075
That's Agot. He helped us
when we first got here.

1:12:21.108 --> 1:12:23.144
- Alex is safe and sound.
- Where is she?

1:12:23.177 --> 1:12:25.478
Waiting for you
in the Temple of Chronology.

1:12:25.513 --> 1:12:27.815
- I'll take you there.
- Thank you, Agot.

1:12:31.919 --> 1:12:33.955
We have some breakfast left,
if you'd care to join us.

1:12:33.988 --> 1:12:35.122
Oh, there's breakfast?

1:12:38.926 --> 1:12:41.796
I have enough
for my needs,
thank you.

1:12:44.098 --> 1:12:47.568
If he ever asks
to see the Crystals,
you mustn't oblige.

1:12:47.602 --> 1:12:49.502
What do you mean?

1:12:49.537 --> 1:12:53.641
The Crystals hold
great power on their own,
even without the Tempus Key.

1:12:53.674 --> 1:12:55.843
There are many
who seek them at any cost.

1:12:55.877 --> 1:12:59.113
If Deimos were to ever obtain
all three Crystals,

1:12:59.146 --> 1:13:03.050
he'd becomes unstoppable
and the war would be lost.

1:13:04.852 --> 1:13:06.954
You heard him.
Alex is waiting for us.

1:13:08.823 --> 1:13:12.059
And the way is clear.
Continue as planned.

1:13:12.093 --> 1:13:14.795
She will face the others
at the gate.

1:13:14.829 --> 1:13:17.798
<i>I'm with them now.</i>
<i>Will she be ready?</i>

1:13:17.832 --> 1:13:20.500
She already is.
She just doesn't know it yet.

1:13:22.570 --> 1:13:24.739
How long was I asleep?

1:13:24.772 --> 1:13:27.474
As long as your body needed.
How do you feel?

1:13:28.910 --> 1:13:31.612
Different.
But the same.

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:34.815
Who were you talking to?

1:13:34.849 --> 1:13:38.052
- I have some difficult news.
- What is it?

1:13:38.085 --> 1:13:39.654
The other Guardians.

1:13:39.687 --> 1:13:43.224
Their Atlantean companion
has stolen and now wields

1:13:43.257 --> 1:13:45.960
the Crystal of Chronometry
and all its power.

1:13:45.993 --> 1:13:48.129
He now seeks
the Crystal of Chronology,

1:13:48.162 --> 1:13:50.765
- but they are powerless
to stop him.
- No!

1:13:50.798 --> 1:13:52.499
Agot is traveling
there to help,

1:13:52.533 --> 1:13:54.568
but I fear
he may not survive.

1:13:54.602 --> 1:13:56.871
We have to help them!
You can stop him!

1:13:56.904 --> 1:13:59.707
Until all three Crystals
are removed from their temples,

1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:01.609
I cannot leave this place.

1:14:10.518 --> 1:14:12.820
- I can.
- It's too dangerous.

1:14:14.288 --> 1:14:17.825
Maybe. But what
other choice do I have?

1:14:19.694 --> 1:14:21.562
It controls the way
time flows through me.

1:14:22.930 --> 1:14:24.966
So let's make this
an even fight.

1:14:26.534 --> 1:14:28.769
I'm done with being weak.

1:14:28.803 --> 1:14:31.539
I'm finished
with being small!

1:14:31.572 --> 1:14:34.008
I'm through
with being young!

1:14:58.299 --> 1:14:59.800
I'm so tall.

1:15:00.868 --> 1:15:04.872
And powerful. And fast.

1:15:04.905 --> 1:15:07.541
All the strength of age.

1:15:07.575 --> 1:15:09.076
He won't know
what hit him.

1:15:09.110 --> 1:15:10.978
How will you get there?

1:15:11.012 --> 1:15:14.148
- I'm gonna run.
- But you have no armor.

1:15:14.181 --> 1:15:15.249
I don't need any.

1:15:25.292 --> 1:15:28.295
We're very close now!
Almost there!

1:15:29.897 --> 1:15:31.932
You said the war
will continue on,

1:15:31.966 --> 1:15:33.701
even after we find
the Crystals?

1:15:33.734 --> 1:15:36.103
Deimos and his servants
will stop at nothing
to free Kronos.

1:15:36.137 --> 1:15:38.906
What happened before?
How did you defeat Deimos?

1:15:38.939 --> 1:15:41.842
We almost didn't,
but fate was on our side.

1:15:41.876 --> 1:15:44.178
We were able to imprison him
where he remains to this day.

1:15:44.211 --> 1:15:45.880
Imprison how?

1:15:45.913 --> 1:15:48.983
In a stone table in the Forest
of Forgotten Thoughts.

1:15:49.016 --> 1:15:51.185
The tablet was shattered
to ensure he couldn't escape.

1:15:51.218 --> 1:15:52.620
- It can't be.
- Oh, no!

1:15:53.654 --> 1:15:56.323
- The stone in the forest.
- That broken tablet.

1:15:56.357 --> 1:15:58.859
- Deimos.
- What are you talking about?

1:16:01.929 --> 1:16:03.731
Agot is Deimos.

1:16:06.801 --> 1:16:10.704
He's taken the form of Agot,
no doubt to gain your trust.

1:16:10.738 --> 1:16:12.073
He needs you
to gather the Crystals

1:16:12.106 --> 1:16:13.707
since he can't enter
the Temples himself.

1:16:13.741 --> 1:16:15.176
How can we
trust him about Alex?

1:16:15.209 --> 1:16:17.378
How do we even know
she's safe or even waiting
for us at the Temple?

1:16:17.411 --> 1:16:20.181
She's too valuable to him
to cause her any harm.

1:16:20.214 --> 1:16:21.882
At least, until he has
all three Crystals.

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:23.350
We can't let that happen.

1:16:23.384 --> 1:16:25.186
Was he lying
about all of it then?

1:16:25.219 --> 1:16:26.787
Will the door
not take us home?

1:16:26.821 --> 1:16:28.889
- Door?
- The door in the tree.

1:16:28.923 --> 1:16:32.860
The Tempus Key unlocks time
and space, not a door.

1:16:32.893 --> 1:16:36.864
The Key houses the Crystals
and channels their powers.

1:16:36.897 --> 1:16:39.834
Deimos wants the power
of the Crystals,
not the Key.

1:16:44.438 --> 1:16:47.274
You should take it.
Take it far from here.

1:16:47.308 --> 1:16:49.810
- Keep it safe from him.
- I must refuse.

1:16:49.844 --> 1:16:52.980
The Crystals belong
in the hands
of The Warriors Four.

1:16:53.013 --> 1:16:56.083
Our only choice
is to stand and fight.

1:17:02.123 --> 1:17:03.991
I see it!
We're here!

1:17:18.772 --> 1:17:20.407
I can't help but think
this is some kinda trap.

1:17:20.441 --> 1:17:24.078
It's the only way
to get Alex back
and go home.

1:17:24.111 --> 1:17:26.180
The last challenge.

1:17:26.213 --> 1:17:27.948
We can do this.

1:17:27.982 --> 1:17:30.017
We'll do it together.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.335
- I'm confused.
- What happened?

1:17:48.369 --> 1:17:50.271
Nothing.

1:17:50.304 --> 1:17:52.106
I was wondering when you
were gonna get here.

1:17:54.341 --> 1:17:57.945
This is the second Crystal
I've retrieved all by myself.

1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:02.883
It's the Crystal of Chronology.
It wasn't even that hard.

1:18:02.917 --> 1:18:05.986
- Alex, look out!
- You're trouble.

1:18:19.900 --> 1:18:22.269
What did you do to him?

1:18:22.303 --> 1:18:23.771
Alex?

1:18:26.407 --> 1:18:28.008
What happened to you?

1:18:28.042 --> 1:18:30.744
I got better.
Better than you, at least.

1:18:30.778 --> 1:18:33.515
Just admit it. I won.

1:18:33.548 --> 1:18:35.416
I got two Crystals
all by myself

1:18:35.449 --> 1:18:37.151
and the three of you
only managed to get one.

1:18:37.184 --> 1:18:40.354
Alex, this isn't a game!
What did you do to Pamphilos?

1:18:40.387 --> 1:18:44.158
Don't worry.
He can't hurt you now.

1:18:44.191 --> 1:18:46.327
- You-you didn't...
- He's fine.

1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:48.862
He's just trapped behind
an ancient rock formation.

1:18:48.896 --> 1:18:50.731
See how he likes it.

1:18:53.901 --> 1:18:57.371
Alex...
we were...

1:18:58.573 --> 1:19:01.342
so worried about you.

1:19:04.011 --> 1:19:08.550
Oh, yeah? So worried
you got matching new outfits
and picked up a boy?

1:19:08.583 --> 1:19:11.785
The Crystal of Chronology!
Incredible!

1:19:11.819 --> 1:19:12.953
Beautiful, isn't it?

1:19:12.987 --> 1:19:15.122
- Alex, don't!
- Relax, Zoey.

1:19:16.524 --> 1:19:19.093
Alex, you can't trust him.
He's using you.

1:19:19.126 --> 1:19:22.162
Agot kept me safe.
He protected me.

1:19:22.196 --> 1:19:23.964
Where were you?
Off with some boy.

1:19:23.998 --> 1:19:25.899
It's not like that,
Alex.

1:19:25.933 --> 1:19:30.237
Whatever. Let's just get
the other Crystal
from Pamphilos and go home.

1:19:30.271 --> 1:19:32.273
He doesn't have it!

1:19:32.306 --> 1:19:35.276
I don't know
what Agot told you,
but it was a lie!

1:19:37.478 --> 1:19:40.414
- Sybil, I'm not
a kid anymore!
- Clearly!

1:19:40.447 --> 1:19:43.417
I am more powerful
than the three of you
combined!

1:19:43.450 --> 1:19:46.854
Just give me the Crystal,
so we can go home!

1:19:46.887 --> 1:19:50.824
Ow! What the...
Look out!

1:20:21.155 --> 1:20:22.222
Alex!

1:20:24.391 --> 1:20:26.093
Get away from her.

1:20:26.126 --> 1:20:27.995
I've been trying to tell you,
he's here to help us.

1:20:28.028 --> 1:20:30.230
Your powers
are truly incredible.

1:20:30.264 --> 1:20:34.068
If you hand me
the other Crystal as well,
I might be able to--

1:20:34.101 --> 1:20:36.170
<i>Verum adte!</i>
Show your true form!

1:20:51.619 --> 1:20:53.020
Agot?

1:20:54.689 --> 1:20:56.524
This is my true form.

1:20:57.324 --> 1:21:00.427
I didn't want
to frighten you before.

1:21:00.461 --> 1:21:03.097
But... you're Agot.

1:21:04.098 --> 1:21:07.134
You're small
and weak, like me.

1:21:07.167 --> 1:21:10.137
You're not small
and weak anymore.

1:21:11.438 --> 1:21:13.407
You are strong.

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:17.579
You can save this world,
and I can help you.

1:21:19.046 --> 1:21:21.315
No. You...

1:21:23.585 --> 1:21:25.119
You lied to me.

1:21:25.152 --> 1:21:27.589
No, Alex.

1:21:27.622 --> 1:21:29.890
I protected you.

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:35.530
They must be
working together,

1:21:35.563 --> 1:21:38.065
in league with the forces
of darkness.

1:21:42.236 --> 1:21:43.437
No.

1:21:51.378 --> 1:21:53.013
It's me.

1:22:05.159 --> 1:22:06.561
What have I...

1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:41.028
Alex, you have to stop this!

1:22:42.664 --> 1:22:46.200
I can't.
I can't control it.

1:22:46.233 --> 1:22:49.002
You can.
I know you can.

1:22:50.538 --> 1:22:52.206
I'm scared.

1:23:03.551 --> 1:23:06.053
- No, Sybil, stop!
- You can't!

1:23:06.086 --> 1:23:07.589
I have to.

1:23:23.671 --> 1:23:27.274
I can't stop it.

1:23:27.307 --> 1:23:28.776
You can.

1:23:29.777 --> 1:23:31.044
I can't!

1:23:32.847 --> 1:23:34.749
Then we'll just have
to stop it together.

1:23:58.338 --> 1:24:01.341
I'm so sorry.

1:24:01.375 --> 1:24:04.177
It's okay. I'm here.

1:24:21.228 --> 1:24:22.630
No matter.

1:24:26.601 --> 1:24:28.570
- Oh, no.
- What?

1:24:28.603 --> 1:24:31.204
- It's Greya.
- Who's Greya?

1:24:31.238 --> 1:24:33.340
A second ago, I would
have said a friend of mine.

1:24:33.373 --> 1:24:34.742
Right.

1:24:44.552 --> 1:24:46.353
Greya is a dragon?

1:24:46.386 --> 1:24:48.155
Long story.

1:25:13.313 --> 1:25:15.516
- It's now or never.
- For what?

1:25:15.550 --> 1:25:18.185
To become
the Guardians of Time.

1:25:18.218 --> 1:25:19.721
This should be interesting.

1:25:37.739 --> 1:25:41.408
Agot kept me safe.
He protected me.

1:25:41.441 --> 1:25:43.377
Where were you?
Off with some boy.

1:25:43.410 --> 1:25:45.445
It's not
like that, Alex.

1:25:45.479 --> 1:25:47.582
- Whatever.
- I wanted to go back further.

1:25:47.615 --> 1:25:49.851
Get the other Crystal
from Pamphilos,
so we can go home.

1:25:49.884 --> 1:25:51.786
He doesn't have it.

1:25:51.819 --> 1:25:54.589
In exactly 17 seconds,
that creature is gonna strike.

1:25:54.622 --> 1:25:56.390
Theo has
photographic memory.

1:25:56.423 --> 1:25:58.358
It's a little more
complicated than that.

1:25:58.392 --> 1:26:01.461
- Why aren't we noticing?
-  - Sybil, I'm not a kid anymore!

1:26:01.495 --> 1:26:02.630
Clearly!

1:26:02.664 --> 1:26:04.297
Are you gonna
throw that rock at me?

1:26:04.331 --> 1:26:08.870
I already did.
In three, two...

1:26:09.904 --> 1:26:13.641
Ow! What the...
Look out!

1:26:17.444 --> 1:26:19.747
That really hurt,
you know?

1:26:19.781 --> 1:26:21.749
It had to be done,
for the good of the group.

1:26:21.783 --> 1:26:23.618
- Deimos.
-  - Show your true form!

1:26:23.651 --> 1:26:25.318
What do we do?
He's gonna see us.

1:26:25.352 --> 1:26:27.655
- He won't see us.
- How do you know?

1:26:27.689 --> 1:26:29.456
Because he didn't
see us before.

1:26:29.489 --> 1:26:30.825
What we don't know
is what happens

1:26:30.858 --> 1:26:32.994
after our past selves
travel back in time.

1:26:33.027 --> 1:26:36.531
So, what you're saying
is, he won't see us yet?

1:26:36.564 --> 1:26:39.299
Precisely.
We narrowly escaped before,

1:26:39.332 --> 1:26:42.003
but we need to formulate a plan
for what comes next.

1:26:48.375 --> 1:26:50.210
I'm sorry
about this next part.

1:27:07.327 --> 1:27:10.631
I have to say, Alex,
it's quite an impressive
ability.

1:27:10.665 --> 1:27:12.667
You've managed
to utilize time itself

1:27:12.700 --> 1:27:14.836
as both a defense mechanism
and a weapon.

1:27:16.571 --> 1:27:18.840
I probably shouldn't have
rushed into it, though.

1:27:18.873 --> 1:27:22.409
It's not the age,
it's the experience.

1:27:22.442 --> 1:27:25.445
This is it.
We just caught up with our previous timeline.

1:27:28.448 --> 1:27:31.018
- So, what's the plan?
- We improvise.

1:27:31.052 --> 1:27:32.520
Clever trick.

1:27:32.553 --> 1:27:34.756
But you'll need
more than that
to defeat me.

1:27:35.890 --> 1:27:37.525
I think that's our cue.

1:27:45.533 --> 1:27:47.535
- Agot?
- Fascinating.

1:27:47.568 --> 1:27:50.437
Now, we're watching
our past selves
watch our past selves.

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:54.307
This is getting complicated.

1:27:54.341 --> 1:27:57.011
It seems like
we can't go back any further
than this point in time.

1:27:57.044 --> 1:27:58.646
Not without the Key.

1:27:58.679 --> 1:28:00.515
Sorry, everyone,
but my embarrassing
solo performance

1:28:00.548 --> 1:28:01.649
is coming up again.

1:28:10.725 --> 1:28:12.727
I'm sorry we
keep reliving this, Alex.

1:28:17.098 --> 1:28:19.100
It's all in the past.

1:28:19.133 --> 1:28:20.568
Well, so are we.

1:28:22.136 --> 1:28:23.571
If we can't
go back any further,

1:28:23.604 --> 1:28:24.872
aren't we kind of
out of options?

1:28:24.906 --> 1:28:25.740
One thing at a time.

1:28:25.773 --> 1:28:27.508
I'm sure there's something
we can do.

1:28:27.542 --> 1:28:29.110
If we can't change
any of the variables,

1:28:29.143 --> 1:28:30.878
then our fate is pretty much
fixed at this point.

1:28:32.814 --> 1:28:35.482
- Speaking of, Sybil...
- Right.

1:28:35.516 --> 1:28:37.118
Nice trick,
but you'll--

1:28:37.151 --> 1:28:39.352
- Tell me when.
- Now.

1:28:44.391 --> 1:28:46.727
Are we going to keep
playin' this game?

1:28:48.529 --> 1:28:50.865
It's grown
rather tiresome.

1:28:50.898 --> 1:28:52.867
That's right. We can't
keep this up forever.

1:28:52.900 --> 1:28:55.636
And we can't let him
take the power of the Crystals
for himself either.

1:29:02.743 --> 1:29:04.011
This?

1:29:05.412 --> 1:29:07.515
I don't want this.

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:16.423
I don't want the power
of the Crystals.

1:29:16.456 --> 1:29:17.925
I want to destroy them.

1:29:20.027 --> 1:29:23.898
It's the only way
to bring about
the return of Kronos!

1:29:34.008 --> 1:29:37.545
Whoa. So, freezing time
is Zoey's power.

1:29:37.578 --> 1:29:40.047
- What's your power, Sybil?
- We don't know yet.

1:29:42.016 --> 1:29:43.383
Past.

1:29:45.052 --> 1:29:47.788
Present. Future!

1:29:49.023 --> 1:29:50.490
You can see
the future, can't you?

1:29:50.524 --> 1:29:52.159
You can what?

1:29:52.193 --> 1:29:54.695
I think my mind
can travel through time.

1:29:54.729 --> 1:29:56.063
I'm glad we got that
straightened out,

1:29:56.097 --> 1:29:58.431
but I don't know how long
I can hold this.

1:29:58.465 --> 1:29:59.600
What's the play?

1:30:00.635 --> 1:30:03.503
- I think I can change
one of the variables.
- How?

1:30:03.537 --> 1:30:06.439
If I use my power together
with the Crystal of Chronology.

1:30:06.473 --> 1:30:08.542
- You mean that pile of dust?
- I can fix that.

1:30:10.011 --> 1:30:12.580
Yeah. I don't know
how much more I've got in me.

1:30:12.613 --> 1:30:13.948
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

1:31:20.014 --> 1:31:21.148
Alex!

1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:34.929
I'll be right back.

1:32:58.646 --> 1:33:00.181
It's all right, Sybil.

1:33:05.219 --> 1:33:08.656
I suppose
he wasn't expecting me.

1:33:08.689 --> 1:33:10.791
And neither were you,
I gather.

1:33:13.127 --> 1:33:15.362
Did you find
what you were looking for?

1:33:15.396 --> 1:33:16.797
Yes, Papa.

1:33:18.132 --> 1:33:19.767
I have to go
and take care of something,

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.002
but you go right back
to what you were doing.

1:33:28.242 --> 1:33:30.311
Alex! It's here.
It's in the bag.

1:33:30.344 --> 1:33:31.812
- What?
- The Tempus Key!

1:33:31.846 --> 1:33:33.681
I put it in the messenger bag
ten years ago.

1:33:33.714 --> 1:33:34.915
Tear open the lining!

1:34:02.910 --> 1:34:04.345
I have it here!

1:34:26.267 --> 1:34:29.003
Enough!
Give me the Crystals!

1:34:29.036 --> 1:34:31.172
Get your own!

1:34:53.227 --> 1:34:55.262
Thank you.

1:34:55.296 --> 1:34:57.831
It's been my honor.

1:35:02.136 --> 1:35:03.771
Let's go home.

1:35:16.183 --> 1:35:18.285
We couldn't have done it
without you, Alex.

1:35:18.319 --> 1:35:21.088
I think I'm okay
with turning 11
before I turn 20.

1:35:21.121 --> 1:35:22.957
Probably a good idea.

1:35:22.990 --> 1:35:25.859
You're gonna be
an amazing woman someday,

1:35:25.893 --> 1:35:28.697
but right now
I just want you to be
my little sister.

1:35:36.337 --> 1:35:38.906
Looks like you
have a lot to tell me.

1:35:38.939 --> 1:35:40.941
I can say the same
about you.

1:35:58.325 --> 1:36:01.829
Did you tell them
the truth?

1:36:01.862 --> 1:36:03.964
I told them
what they needed to know.
