WEBVTT

00:03.655 --> 00:06.615
Your performance
is disappointing.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.705
Misery is declining
in Cedar Valley.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.055
While joy is on the rise!

00:12.142 --> 00:15.276
There's nothing I can do!
They opened a dog rescue!

00:15.363 --> 00:18.192
You can't expect me
to compete with puppies!

00:18.279 --> 00:22.196
That is precisely what
the Chairman expects.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.766
Don't send me to
the Flow of Failed Phantoms!

00:27.853 --> 00:29.725
Please! I can do better!

00:29.812 --> 00:33.294
They had puppies!

00:35.687 --> 00:38.734
Just one last ghost
to review.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.823
- Not him.
- Must we?

00:40.910 --> 00:44.044
The Ghost Council summons...

00:44.131 --> 00:45.828
Scratch.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.007
Hm-what?

00:51.094 --> 00:55.968
Hey! The Ghost Council!
You guys are lookin' good.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.494
Especially you,
Mr. Tower of Dour, here.

00:59.581 --> 01:03.280
Mr. Chairman, emanema-nee!

01:03.367 --> 01:06.892
- Scratch, you are rude!

01:06.979 --> 01:09.591
- Crude!
- And disgusting!

01:09.678 --> 01:12.463
But we can't argue
with your numbers.

01:12.550 --> 01:16.685
Your town of Brighton
is truly a miserable place.

01:16.772 --> 01:20.732
We shall mark your performance
as "adequate."

01:20.819 --> 01:23.083
Now, our work is done!

01:23.170 --> 01:26.651
Yes, we are off to
the Haughty Haunts Club!

01:26.738 --> 01:29.437
Oh! I've never been.
I hear it's nice.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.004
Is there a dress code?
Should I put on pants?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.050
Also, should I put on legs?

01:34.137 --> 01:37.184
You are not invited, Scratch.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.795
But you are dismissed.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.019
Jerks! Who needs 'em?!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.239
Didn't wanna go to
their stupid club, anyway!

01:49.326 --> 01:53.156
I <i>like</i> being alone!
I <i>like</i> being by myself!

01:53.243 --> 01:57.029
I don't need-- Any. Body. Else!

02:14.221 --> 02:16.048
<i>Ah, Brighton!</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.139
You know what I see here--
limitless potential!

02:23.491 --> 02:26.058
Know what I see? A clean slate.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.582
And let's keep it that way,
Darryl.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.541
No more disasters,
flammable or otherwise.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.152
I make no promises.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.114
Hey, Mom! We're almost there.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.247
<i>I know.
I've been tracking you.</i>

02:40.334 --> 02:41.770
<i>Tell Peter to step on it!</i>

02:41.857 --> 02:43.511
Hi, Grandma Nin!

02:45.295 --> 02:47.645
Ah! Here we are, McGees!

02:47.732 --> 02:50.387
Well, it's not the worst house
we ever lived in.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.998
Oh. Hold on,
that's not our house.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.132
<i>This</i> is our house.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.308
Ohh.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.267
<i>Turn me around so I can see.</i>

03:00.354 --> 03:02.138
<i>Ew! Turn me back.</i>

03:02.225 --> 03:05.272
Granted, it is
a bit of a fixer-upper.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.754
Dad, I'm not gonna lie to you.

03:09.841 --> 03:12.409
I love it! Whoo!

03:12.496 --> 03:15.107
Huh, what? A family
moving into <i>my</i> house?!

03:15.195 --> 03:17.066
Oh, no-no-no-no!
I gotta stop--

03:17.153 --> 03:18.894
- Ooh!

03:18.981 --> 03:21.810
Oh, wow! My new bedroom is...

03:21.897 --> 03:22.985
kind of a dump.

03:23.072 --> 03:26.336
It needs the Molly McGee touch!

03:26.423 --> 03:29.600
Ugh... Hey-hey!
Those cobwebs are vintage!

03:29.687 --> 03:31.341
A ghost?!

03:31.428 --> 03:33.038
Okay, Molly. Okay, focus up.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.737
You've never met a ghost
before. Make a good impression.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.129
- Ghost hug!

03:37.217 --> 03:38.740
Sorry about that. Here we go.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.656
Hey, does this go here?
How 'bout a-- heh.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.311
I guess I can be a little
too friendly, sometimes.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.008
Yeah, well, I'm not!

03:46.095 --> 03:48.315
- Be gone, human!
- Whoa...

03:48.402 --> 03:50.491
- Whoa!

03:50.578 --> 03:52.710
- Huh?!
- Did you just make me fly?!

03:52.797 --> 03:55.974
This attic has everything
and it comes with a bonus you!

03:56.061 --> 03:58.150
I'm never ever ever ever
ever leaving!

03:58.238 --> 03:59.891
Fine. If you won't leave--

03:59.978 --> 04:02.198
Mind taking
a step back. please?

04:02.285 --> 04:04.722
No, that's too far--
A little-- No, come back--

04:04.809 --> 04:06.333
There! Stop! Okay--

04:06.420 --> 04:08.944
I curse you, Molly McGee!

04:09.031 --> 04:11.599
Wherever you go,
whatever you do,

04:11.686 --> 04:14.602
for the rest of your days,
I'll be there,

04:14.689 --> 04:17.431
haunting you, tormenting you,

04:17.518 --> 04:19.868
turning your
every waking moment

04:19.955 --> 04:23.698
into an unending nightmare!

04:23.785 --> 04:27.223
Fantastic performance!
- Huh?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.747
Where did those bugs
even come from? What?!

04:29.834 --> 04:31.749
- Now that we're best friends--
- Best friends?

04:31.836 --> 04:33.751
Yeah. You're
going everywhere I go

04:33.838 --> 04:35.579
and doing everything I do,
right?

04:35.666 --> 04:38.060
- I guess?
- Best friends confirmed!

04:38.147 --> 04:39.714
We're gonna make
music videos together,

04:39.801 --> 04:41.368
become Internet famous,

04:41.455 --> 04:42.717
then we're gonna
tell ghost stories all night

04:42.804 --> 04:44.327
and you're gonna be
so good at it

04:44.414 --> 04:45.981
and I'm gonna be like,
"I'm so scared!"

04:46.068 --> 04:47.765
Then, we're gonna volunteer
to wash old people!

04:47.852 --> 04:50.028
- Why would we do that?
- You know, best friend stuff!

04:50.115 --> 04:51.856
Now, what are
your thoughts on posters?

04:51.943 --> 04:53.945
Kittens or puppies?

04:54.032 --> 04:55.599
Mm, maybe the puppies...

04:55.686 --> 04:58.950
I didn't curse Molly McGee...
She cursed me!

06:02.927 --> 06:04.842
Would you leave, please?

06:04.929 --> 06:07.715
Ooh-- Sorry.
Nope on that.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.370
See, Dad's City Planner job
pulled us McGees

06:10.457 --> 06:13.155
from Ada, Oklahoma
to Zuni, New Mexico

06:13.242 --> 06:14.765
and everywhere in between.

06:14.852 --> 06:19.161
I've, um, left behind
a lot of friends.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.902
But Brighton's
gonna be different.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.208
We McGees are
making our forever home...

06:23.295 --> 06:25.123
right here.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.474
And I've already got
a forever friend!

06:27.561 --> 06:30.302
Ugh! I am not
a part of your problems!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.827
- Aah!
- Oh, now, come on--

06:32.914 --> 06:34.872
You did the too friendly thing,
again!

06:34.959 --> 06:36.961
Come back, Scratch!

06:37.048 --> 06:39.050
Let me--

06:40.922 --> 06:42.184
- Ugh!

06:42.271 --> 06:43.664
- Uhh...

06:43.751 --> 06:45.361
- Huh?
- What's this? I, uh--

06:45.448 --> 06:48.016
Oh, no, this curse
just got worse.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.931
No, way.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.934
You come to me
whenever I say your name?!

06:53.021 --> 06:55.676
On demand bestie?!

06:55.763 --> 06:57.678
It's the future of friendship!

06:57.765 --> 07:00.550
Oh, no-no-no-no!
I gotta fix this!

07:01.986 --> 07:04.162
Scratch? Where'd you go?

07:07.383 --> 07:09.603
Sorry, chief, can't let you in.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.256
I just gotta talk to--
Oh! Those! Them!

07:11.343 --> 07:12.997
I just-- Can you grab 'em?
Can you

07:13.084 --> 07:15.043
turn around and look
where I'm pointing, please?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.479
Don't you ghost me!

07:16.566 --> 07:18.699
What are you doing here,
Scratch?

07:18.786 --> 07:20.875
Huh, okay,

07:20.962 --> 07:23.399
Is there any way for a ghost

07:23.486 --> 07:25.706
who has
accidentally cursed himself

07:25.793 --> 07:27.621
to un-curse himself?

07:27.708 --> 07:29.710
I'm asking for a friend,
of course.

07:29.797 --> 07:33.017
Ridiculous!
You have no friends.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.411
Ha ha ha. Okay,
but would it kill you, again,

07:35.498 --> 07:38.283
to give me a straight answer,
please?

07:38.370 --> 07:39.894
"Wherever you go,

07:39.981 --> 07:43.375
Whatever you do,
I'll be there?"

07:43.463 --> 07:47.423
This friend of yours must be
quite the dunderhead, Scratch.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.687
It's more of a curse
on the ghost than the human.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.907
Well, there is one way out...

07:52.994 --> 07:55.387
"If you won't leave..."

07:55.475 --> 07:58.216
Your friend must
scare the human so badly

07:58.303 --> 08:00.871
they leave the house forever.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.004
And then the curse
is broken. Okay.

08:03.091 --> 08:06.398
But this is the thing,
this girl, she doesn't scare!

08:06.486 --> 08:10.402
Girl?! As in a child?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.884
Surely, she doesn't make all
the decisions for her family.

08:13.971 --> 08:18.280
So, I can't scare Molly,
but scaring her family?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.501
I can do that,
no problem!

08:21.588 --> 08:26.462
I mean, <i>my friend</i> can do that,
no problem.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.856
You want to put the cereal
in <i>this</i> cabinet?

08:28.943 --> 08:30.379
That's sheer madness!

08:30.466 --> 08:32.599
It completes the bowl,
utensil, cereal triangle.

08:32.686 --> 08:33.948
Cereal has to go in here.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.168
No, cereal has to go in here.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.135
Leave the boxes!
Leave the cereal!

08:47.222 --> 08:49.093
Leave everything!
Leave yourselves!

08:49.180 --> 08:51.835
Bring yourselves!

08:53.881 --> 08:55.404
Oh, boy.

08:58.233 --> 09:01.149
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Guys, it's okay!

09:01.236 --> 09:03.630
I see you've met
my new best friend, Scratch.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.153
It has a name?!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.285
Out of the way, Molly!
We're leaving this house

09:07.372 --> 09:09.070
and we are never coming back!

09:09.157 --> 09:11.246
- We got the cereal, right?
- No, no-no-no, Dad.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.682
We can't leave
our forever home

09:12.769 --> 09:14.336
just because it
comes with a ghost.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.512
Besides, Scratch
doesn't mean to be scary.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.340
He's just, I don't know,
a little hangry?

09:18.427 --> 09:20.255
- I am not hangry!
- Do you want a snack?

09:20.342 --> 09:21.996
I mean, I'd have
a bite of something

09:22.083 --> 09:23.432
but it doesn't mean I'm hangry.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.955
- Granola bar?
- Not if it's carob.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.741
Darryl, you're
gonna love Scratch.

09:27.828 --> 09:31.179
- Ugh, he's so gross.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.833
- Gimme more!
- Wha-- Hey!

09:32.920 --> 09:34.661
Dad, you always tell us

09:34.748 --> 09:37.011
we shouldn't be afraid
of people who are different.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.752
Shouldn't that
apply to a ghost?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.884
You're right, Molly.
And I think the preferred term

09:40.971 --> 09:43.408
is "post-living person." Hmm?

09:43.495 --> 09:45.715
Welcome to our home!
I mean, your home.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.761
Which is, technically,
our home.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.720
I'm a little flustered. Sorry.
This is all very new to me.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.202
And Mom, you're really
gonna love--

09:54.289 --> 09:56.465
Way ahead of you, Moll.
Nobody disclosed a ghost!

09:56.552 --> 09:58.032
I'm calling our realtor

09:58.119 --> 09:59.990
and getting some money back
on this dump!

10:00.077 --> 10:03.690
What is wrong with you people?!

10:07.737 --> 10:10.000
I think he
really likes you guys.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.786
- The new house is amazing,

10:12.873 --> 10:14.918
Grandma Nin.
It came with a ghost!

10:15.005 --> 10:17.747
But don't be scared, I mean,
we're already best friends, so.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.533
We are not
friends, Grandma Nin!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.231
<i>I'm not scared, Molly.</i>

10:23.318 --> 10:25.929
<i>In Thailand,
many houses have ghosts.</i>

10:26.016 --> 10:28.802
<i>Have I ever told you about
"san phra phum"?</i>

10:28.889 --> 10:30.760
Uh, no. What's that?

10:30.847 --> 10:33.676
<i>A little house within
your home to honor your ghost.</i>

10:33.763 --> 10:35.983
Tell me more about this,
please.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.421
You mean something
like... this?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.118
What do you think, Scratch?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.555
It's got
a nice, open floor plan.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.209
A few cobwebs here and there.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.081
Uh, this might work.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.780
So, would it be okay if we
stuck around a little while?

10:50.867 --> 10:55.176
Yeah, sure-- <i>
On a trial basis.</i>

10:55.263 --> 10:57.613
<i>Don't forget to leave
an offering of food and drink</i>

10:57.700 --> 10:59.397
<i>to keep your ghost happy.</i>

10:59.484 --> 11:02.400
I'm quite partial to tacos
and strawberry soda.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.489
You got it, Scratch.
Two tacos comin' up!

11:04.576 --> 11:05.926
Whatcha want on those bad boys?

11:06.013 --> 11:08.058
- Surprise me.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

11:08.145 --> 11:09.407
Chocolate, it is.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.027
