(crying)

03:29.710 --> 03:31.086
Maggie:
Oh, shit.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.245
It's been a day and a half.

03:36.509 --> 03:38.670
They didn't find any either.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.803
- Sasha: How do you know?
- I know.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.562
How much longer we got?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.890
60 miles.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.023
I wasn't talking about that.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.659
(theme music playing )

04:44.535 --> 04:47.698
(engine sputtering )

04:49.623 --> 04:51.909
Abraham: We're out,
just like the other one.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.949
Rick:
So we walk.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.149
We're not at our strongest.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.066
We'll get 'em when it's best.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.621
High ground,
something like that.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.780
They're not going anywhere.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.628
It's been three weeks
since Atlanta.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.961
I know you lost
something back there.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.128
(Judith fussing )

05:48.974 --> 05:50.714
She's hungry.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.635
She's okay.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.809
She's going to be okay.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.939
We need to find water, food.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.439
We'll hit something in the road.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.197
It's gonna rain sooner or later.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.997
I'm gonna head out.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.828
See what I can find.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.085
Hey, don't be too long.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.336
I'll go with you.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.668
I got it.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.548
You gonna stop me?

06:31.100 --> 06:33.762
Found this when we were
looking for water.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.801
What is it?

06:35.980 --> 06:38.096
I think it used to play music.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.474
lt's broken.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.444
Thanks, Carl.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.195
I thought you might like it.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.038
| used to joke these things
were leftovers

07:00.212 --> 07:02.294
from the days of hair shirts.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.547
The church actually made...

07:07.386 --> 07:10.844
shirts out of hair.

07:11.015 --> 07:13.552
So if you wore it,
you could atone

07:13.726 --> 07:16.058
just a little for your sins.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.640
I know what a hair shirt is.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.226
My daddy was religious.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.566
| used to be.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.197
If you ever want to talk

07:30.367 --> 07:34.030
about your father
or about Beth--

07:34.204 --> 07:35.944
Please, stop.

07:39.752 --> 07:41.617
Whenever you're ready,
I'm here.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.332
You never even met them.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.003
- I know you're in pain.
- You don't know shit.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.002
You had ajob.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.467
You were there
to save your flock, right?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.132
But you didn't.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.552
You hid.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.189
Don't act like
that didn't happen.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.943
(walkers snarling )

08:34.682 --> 08:36.388
We can take 'em.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.972
Rick's right.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.307
We barely have anything left.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.894
No use in spending it all now.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.981
I can take 'em.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.073
Your brother was pissed, too,

08:55.244 --> 08:56.984
after what he lost.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.364
- It made him stupid.
- We are not the same.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.201
We never were.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.371
But it's still the same.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.837
It just is.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.276
Carol:
Anything?

09:35.451 --> 09:37.533
No, it's too dry.

09:37.703 --> 09:38.863
There ain't nothing here.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.868
Maybe we should start back.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.700
You go.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.370
I think she saved my life.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.748
She saved your life,
too, right?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.061
It was hers.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.695
We're not dead.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.366
That's what you said.

10:26.919 --> 10:29.001
You're not dead.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.456
I know you.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.968
We're different.
I can't let myself...

10:39.431 --> 10:41.171
But you...

10:42.768 --> 10:44.633
I know you.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.014
You have to let yourself feel it.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.285
You will.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.458
(walkers snarling )

11:21.056 --> 11:23.672

(grunting)

12:28.373 --> 12:29.704
Sasha.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.706
Stay in line.
Flank her.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.872
Keep it controlled.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.961
Plan just got dicked.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.968
Stop.
Just get out of here.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.080
I told you to stop.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.741
( panting )

13:48.578 --> 13:51.320
Carl:
Dad, look.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.623
I'm gonna head into the woods,

14:02.801 --> 14:03.881
circle back.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.963
- May I come with?
- No.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.969
No, just me.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.393
(snarling )

15:24.716 --> 15:27.048
(thumping)

15:35.977 --> 15:38.138
(thumping continues)

16:07.259 --> 16:09.215
Maggie.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.217
There's one--

16:14.391 --> 16:16.928
there's one in there.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.593
And I shut it
and it's still in there.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.346
Okay.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.442
(grunts)

16:34.870 --> 16:36.485
( lock clicks)

16:39.166 --> 16:41.657

16:50.468 --> 16:52.754
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( snarling stops)

17:05.025 --> 17:06.811
Let's go.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.909
(thunder rumbling)

18:00.080 --> 18:01.945
( branch snaps)

18:22.560 --> 18:24.892
Tara: So all we found
was booze?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.553
Rosita:
Yeah.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.936
It's not gonna help.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.816
He knows that.

18:31.987 --> 18:35.070
- It's gonna make it worse.
- Yes, it is.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.322
Eugene:
He's a grown man.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.484
And I truly do not know
if things can get worse.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.326
They can.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.874
-( rustling)
- ( growling)

18:55.593 --> 18:57.629
(barking, growling)

19:04.769 --> 19:06.760
- ( silenced gunshots)
- ( dogs whine)

20:06.498 --> 20:08.489
Your brother...

20:10.168 --> 20:12.033
he tried to help me.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.460
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.671
Then you won't.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.303
Don't think.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.267
Just eat.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.537
- Maggie, take a drink.
- No.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.498
Okay.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.835
How about you just talk to me?

21:47.557 --> 21:50.799
I never thought she was alive.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.593
I just didn't.

21:53.771 --> 21:58.936
After Daddy, I don't know
if I couldn't.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.271
And after what Daryl said,

22:01.446 --> 22:03.903
I hoped she was
out there, alive.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.860
And then finding out
that she was

22:07.035 --> 22:09.492
and then she wasn't
in the same day...

22:13.166 --> 22:15.452
Seeing her like that, it--

22:17.754 --> 22:21.338
made it feel like none of it
was ever really there.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.426
Before...

22:27.597 --> 22:30.134
this was just
the dark part and...

22:33.436 --> 22:36.473
I don't know if I want
to fight it anymore.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.980
You do.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.482
You do.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.484
That's who you are.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.148
And maybe
it's a curse nowadays,

22:48.326 --> 22:50.783
but I don't think so.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.821
We fought to be here.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.159
And we have to keep fighting.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.873
Drink.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.270
You know it'll just make
things worse.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.355
The way you're going,

23:21.526 --> 23:23.812
you're what's gonna
make things worse.

23:26.281 --> 23:31.116
Hey, you're with friends.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.036
We're not friends.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.723
Daryl.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.054
No, I'm all right.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.969
Daryl.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.021
Don't.

24:03.192 --> 24:07.231
Hey, we can make it together.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.734
But we can only make it together.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.082
Tell them I went looking for water.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.484
(sizzling )

26:11.696 --> 26:14.108
(crying)

26:48.649 --> 26:49.855
What else are we gonna do?

26:50.026 --> 26:51.266
Not this.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.734
We don't know who left it.

26:53.905 --> 26:56.237
If that's a trap,
we already happen to be in it.

26:56.407 --> 26:59.319
But I, for one, would like to think
it is indeed from a friend.

27:00.328 --> 27:03.536
What if it isn't?
They put something in it?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.660
- Rosita: Eugene.
- Tara: What are you doing, dude?

27:07.835 --> 27:09.120
Quality assurance.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.420
We can't.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.764

27:35.655 --> 27:38.146

27:47.416 --> 27:49.793

27:59.053 --> 28:00.839
Oh, God.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.644
I'm sorry, my Lord.

28:17.822 --> 28:21.485
Rick: Everybody get the bags.
Anything you can find.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.944
I'm sorry.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.484
Come on.

- ( thunder booming)

28:45.808 --> 28:47.844
Let's keep moving.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.639
- There's a barn.
- Where?

28:54.817 --> 28:56.978
(thunder booming)

29:29.894 --> 29:32.180
(snarling )

30:07.264 --> 30:09.425
She had a gun.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.591
She could have shot herself.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.561
Some people can't give up.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.932
Like us.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.482
(thunder crashing )

30:51.100 --> 30:53.807
- I'll try.
- No, too wet.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.145
Carol:
He's gonna be okay.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.520
He bounces back

31:05.698 --> 31:08.155
more than any of us do.

31:08.325 --> 31:11.567
| used to feel sorry for kids
that have to grow up now.

31:11.746 --> 31:13.452
In this.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.286
But I think I got it wrong.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.545
Growing up
is getting used to the world.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.671
This is easier for them.

31:28.846 --> 31:30.677
This isn't the world.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.381
This isn't it.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.225
It might be.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.690
It might.

31:47.865 --> 31:50.106
- That's giving up.
- lt's reality.

31:50.284 --> 31:54.869
Until we see otherwise,
this is what we have to live with.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.588
When I was a kid...

32:11.889 --> 32:16.758
| asked my grandpa once if he ever
killed any Germans in the war.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.391
He wouldn't answer.

32:23.234 --> 32:26.192
He said that was
grown-up stuff, so...

32:28.739 --> 32:32.231
so I asked if the Germans
ever tried to kill him.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.737
But he got real quiet.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.960
He said he was dead the minute
he stepped into enemy territory.

32:52.346 --> 32:55.463
Every day he woke up

32:55.641 --> 32:57.472
and told himself,
"Rest in peace.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.975
Now get up and go to war."

33:03.274 --> 33:06.892
And then after a few years
of pretending he was dead...

33:10.197 --> 33:12.529
he made it out alive.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.783
That's the trick of it, I think.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.121
We do what we need to do

33:21.292 --> 33:24.284
and then we get to live.

33:25.963 --> 33:30.832
But no matter what we find in DC,
I know we'll be okay.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.761
Because this is how we survive.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.348
We tell ourselves...

33:42.605 --> 33:45.688
that we are the walking dead.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.204
We ain't them.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.335
( branch snaps)

34:14.845 --> 34:16.756
We're not them.

34:16.931 --> 34:18.171
Hey.

34:20.184 --> 34:21.845
We're not.

34:27.691 --> 34:30.603
- We ain't them.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.707
It's okay to rest now.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.514
He was tough.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.263
He was.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.356
So was she.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.733
She didn't know it,

38:03.907 --> 38:05.863
but she was.

38:21.925 --> 38:25.088
The gearbox had some grit in it.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.093
Thank you.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.619
Come on.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.580
- ( door opens)
- ( walkers snarling )

39:28.617 --> 39:30.357
Look at this.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.822
(snarling )

39:35.332 --> 39:37.414
Sasha:
Should have torn us apart.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.294
It didn't.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.901
Sasha:
Why are we here?

40:08.699 --> 40:10.530
Maggie:
For this.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.704
| see it.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.042
Noah, that kid...

40:30.554 --> 40:33.546
he said he didn't know
if he can make it.

40:40.564 --> 40:42.555
That's how I feel.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.900
You're gonna make it.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.616
Both of us, we will.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.074
That's the hard part.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.259
Daryl fixed it.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.310
(winding up)

41:25.525 --> 41:27.686
( clicks )

41:27.861 --> 41:30.477
(sighs)
You gotta be kidding me.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.739
( both laugh )

41:33.909 --> 41:36.446
Hey. Hi.

41:36.620 --> 41:40.033
I didn't mean to interrupt.

41:40.207 --> 41:41.993
Good morning.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.871
My name is Aaron.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.796
I know, stranger danger.

41:49.966 --> 41:54.050
But I'm a friend.

41:57.265 --> 42:00.849
I'd like to talk
to the person in charge.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.805
Rick, right?

42:02.979 --> 42:05.686
- How do you know--
- Why?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.813
l have good news.

42:08.819 --> 42:11.151
