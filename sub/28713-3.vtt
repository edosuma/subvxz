00:02.844 --> 00:04.470
- Get in!
- Who are you?

00:04.506 --> 00:07.507
That's our sister.

00:07.609 --> 00:09.375
There's a story here. I...

00:09.477 --> 00:11.544
And we'll all do
whatever it takes to find Al.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.647
You should come back with us.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.116
You can't help us.
We're going. Come on.

00:17.152 --> 00:18.251
Max? Dylan?

00:18.286 --> 00:19.952
They didn't want
to be found yesterday.

00:19.988 --> 00:21.888
They want to be found.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.557
Somebody knows we're here.

00:24.659 --> 00:25.825
This, the roadblocks,

00:25.860 --> 00:27.727
means we're getting
close to something.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.946
Ranch road 1783.

01:19.948 --> 01:21.214
By the turnaround.

01:21.216 --> 01:22.582
County road.

01:22.584 --> 01:24.484
About three miles north
of the last one.

01:24.486 --> 01:27.320
Nothing new here,
but we got our eyes peeled.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.358
We're getting closer.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.160
The road blocks...

01:34.162 --> 01:35.661
They're starting to form
a perimeter.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.396
Well, the sooner
we can tie a bow around this,

01:37.398 --> 01:39.165
the sooner we can figure out
where to head in.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.100
<i>Then we find al and get the...</i>

01:41.102 --> 01:42.635
<i>...You got to...</i>

01:43.304 --> 01:45.705
john?

01:45.707 --> 01:46.772
John, do you copy?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.674
- Yes.
<i>- John?</i>

01:48.676 --> 01:50.877
No, I think
we're getting out of range.

01:50.879 --> 01:52.612
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:52.614 --> 01:53.913
If you run into trouble,

01:53.915 --> 01:55.381
there is a gas station
off pioneer road.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.217
Clayton may have left
some boxes there.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.686
Luci?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.421
Luci, you copy?

02:02.423 --> 02:04.423
John...

02:19.307 --> 02:21.107
these kinda warnings...

02:22.710 --> 02:25.578
There's some serious people
on the other side of these.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.314
We're serious people.

02:28.316 --> 02:32.285
I know how these things work.

02:32.287 --> 02:33.986
The longer we go
without finding Al,

02:33.988 --> 02:36.255
our chances of finding her
get less and less.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.890
And that was before.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.362
I'll take this one.

02:48.770 --> 02:50.102
Whoa! John?

02:50.104 --> 02:52.004
You hit?
No.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.776
Yeah.

02:56.778 --> 02:58.644
We don't want any trouble!

03:00.114 --> 03:01.747
In the car.

03:05.086 --> 03:07.486
Aah! John, go!

03:07.488 --> 03:08.588
Go!

03:12.527 --> 03:13.893
What the hell was that?

03:13.895 --> 03:15.795
Serious people.

03:15.797 --> 03:16.729
We can outrun them.

03:16.731 --> 03:18.097
They took our weapons.

03:18.099 --> 03:19.832
We're not gonna get far
with what we got.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.567
We need more firepower.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.735
So...

03:27.008 --> 03:29.108
What?

03:29.110 --> 03:32.712
Our luck just turned again.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.000
What is this place?

04:28.002 --> 04:30.369
My old stompin' ground.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.904
Welcome to the gulch.

04:44.708 --> 04:49.144

05:13.062 --> 05:15.796
windpump's screaming like
a banshee.

05:15.798 --> 05:17.899
Might be a dust storm coming.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.668
That's only going to bring
more of the passed.

05:20.670 --> 05:24.071
You used to work here?
No.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.074
Mine was in nacogdoches.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.609
There was more than one?

05:28.611 --> 05:31.379
Yeah, it was a statewide affair.

05:31.381 --> 05:33.581
They were even gonna build one
in macau.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.051
There was a brothel?

05:37.053 --> 05:39.420
They served soup.
That's all.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.122
See?

05:42.258 --> 05:45.293
This is where
we'll find the weapons.

05:45.295 --> 05:46.827
You sure?
Yeah.

05:46.829 --> 05:49.830
These places were all built
off the same set of plans.

05:49.832 --> 05:52.800
Even when we get shot at,

05:52.802 --> 05:54.635
the wind blows us
right where we need to be.

05:54.637 --> 05:56.871
Prefer it blow us
somewhere else?

05:56.873 --> 05:59.006
No.

06:19.495 --> 06:21.696
It's up there.

06:54.964 --> 06:56.864
- All right.
- My last round.

06:56.866 --> 06:59.100
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Plug your ears.

07:07.577 --> 07:10.745
Let's hope this
particular gulch is well-stocked.

07:15.885 --> 07:19.020
I think we're good.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.905
All right.
Let's keep moving.

07:37.907 --> 07:39.173
Aah!

07:39.175 --> 07:42.677
You okay?

07:42.679 --> 07:44.812
Yeah.

07:49.352 --> 07:51.786
Can you move it?

07:51.788 --> 07:53.120
Not yet.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.260
I'm sorry for what happened,
Luci.

08:00.463 --> 08:01.962
I'm not.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.868
I wouldn't change it.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.037
I don't regret
getting on that plane.

08:10.039 --> 08:15.643
There's words,
and there's action.

08:15.645 --> 08:17.178
We took action.

08:19.215 --> 08:21.649
If we can crash a plane
for someone,

08:21.651 --> 08:25.586
if we can almost die
for someone,

08:25.588 --> 08:28.923
whatever comes next...

08:28.925 --> 08:31.158
How bad can it be?

08:38.967 --> 08:41.335
Morgan, we're coming back.
I repeat... we're coming back.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.337
Copy?

08:47.210 --> 08:50.478
<i>...Ylan...
Get back to... Now...</i>

08:50.480 --> 08:52.012
Alicia, wait... go back.

08:53.449 --> 08:57.017
<i>...I repeat, dylan,
get back to van, now...</i>

08:57.019 --> 08:58.352
<i>I found some canned corn</i>

08:58.354 --> 08:59.854
<i>in a car by the fireworks stand.</i>

08:59.856 --> 09:01.655
<i>Dylan, don't say where you are.</i>

09:01.657 --> 09:02.823
<i>They'll hear you.</i>

09:02.825 --> 09:06.761
Annie? Dylan?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.696
It's alicia.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.030
We want to help you.

09:10.032 --> 09:12.533
<i>Alicia?
What's wrong with you?</i>

09:12.535 --> 09:14.135
<i>We told you to leave us alone.</i>

09:14.137 --> 09:17.004
<i>It isn't safe to talk out here.</i>

09:17.006 --> 09:20.241
Where are you?

09:20.243 --> 09:24.311
<i>We say... they find us.</i>

09:24.313 --> 09:26.247
Who?

09:26.249 --> 09:28.549
<i>Dylan... Hide.</i>

09:28.551 --> 09:29.850
<i>I can see them...</i>

09:33.656 --> 09:36.023
we can't wait.
We need to find them.

09:57.780 --> 10:02.149
Morgan? Luciana?
Can you hear us?

10:02.151 --> 10:04.752
Morgan? Luci?
I repeat... can you hear us?

10:04.754 --> 10:07.288
Nothing?

10:09.959 --> 10:12.126
How long do these things
usually last?

10:12.128 --> 10:13.861
Well...

10:13.863 --> 10:16.997
Each one's a little different.

10:16.999 --> 10:19.433
But I think we can make it
to the car if we hurry.

10:23.105 --> 10:25.272
What's it like if we wind up
getting stuck in it?

10:25.274 --> 10:27.007
We won't.

10:27.009 --> 10:28.209
We can make it.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.044
But what's it like if we don't?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.679
Sort of a moonless midnight.

10:31.681 --> 10:32.913
No treat to breathe.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.789
Okay.

10:41.791 --> 10:43.557
We'll wait it out.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.493
We can load them
in the meantime.

10:45.495 --> 10:47.495
And we'll take these blanks
with us

10:47.497 --> 10:49.897
'cause we can use this powder.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.499
This will come in handy.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.443
Were you a good guy
or a bad guy?

11:02.445 --> 11:07.748
I never really got involved
in the theatrics.

11:07.750 --> 11:12.853
My talents more favored
the trick shooting exhibition.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.924
Three.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.059
What's "fanning"?

11:22.031 --> 11:23.797
Cowboy fiction.

11:23.799 --> 11:26.800
How about a "san antonio split"?

11:30.439 --> 11:31.572
Two.

11:31.574 --> 11:37.311
A "fitchburg flim flam"?

11:37.313 --> 11:40.247
A "southern pinkie pull"?

11:42.351 --> 11:47.488
A "st. Louis barn raiser"?

11:47.490 --> 11:49.189
I can keep making these up.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.491
We have lots of time.

11:50.493 --> 11:54.194
We can't just wait here.

11:54.196 --> 11:55.763
We can make it to the car.

11:55.765 --> 11:57.898
Moonless midnight, john.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.134
We can't help anybody
if we don't make it back.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.603
But we can make it.

12:02.605 --> 12:04.905
We can make it.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.537
Come on. Come on!

12:37.607 --> 12:39.306
June!

12:47.283 --> 12:48.649
Hold your fire!

12:48.651 --> 12:51.118
You're gonna draw the passed!

13:33.696 --> 13:35.496
Where is she?

13:35.498 --> 13:37.498
I don't know who you mean.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.000
Tell me,
or I'll put a bullet in your head.

13:40.002 --> 13:41.602
Take it easy, buddy.

13:41.604 --> 13:43.037
Answer me!

13:43.039 --> 13:44.338
Answer me!

13:50.046 --> 13:51.412
Thank you, June bug.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.313
Don't thank me yet.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.883
We'd better get him inside.

14:11.364 --> 14:13.233
Whoever he's looking for...

14:13.237 --> 14:15.729
He's been at it for some time.

14:20.402 --> 14:23.103
That's a hell of a burn.

14:25.441 --> 14:27.074
You think he had that before?

14:27.076 --> 14:29.510
No.

14:29.512 --> 14:32.780
He's all worn down.

14:32.782 --> 14:34.648
Lookin' for this woman.

14:34.650 --> 14:36.850
Maybe he just cracked.

14:36.852 --> 14:40.621
You almost got yourself killed, john.

14:40.623 --> 14:42.122
No.

14:44.527 --> 14:45.826
No.

14:45.828 --> 14:48.328
He was sprayin' and prayin'.

14:48.330 --> 14:50.864
No confidence behind the trigger,

14:50.866 --> 14:52.399
shaky as all get out.

14:52.401 --> 14:53.801
If he's a killer,

14:53.803 --> 14:56.136
he's in no shape to hurt anybody.

14:56.138 --> 14:58.705
But now we got somebody
who genuinely needs our help.

14:58.707 --> 15:00.440
Which is what
we came out here for

15:00.442 --> 15:02.042
in the first place, yeah?

15:05.014 --> 15:06.647
At least the wind's died down.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.048
Even if we were able

15:08.050 --> 15:10.484
to pick them off
as they came in,

15:10.486 --> 15:13.320
we'd only attract more
until we ran out of ammo.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.359
Okay.

15:19.361 --> 15:21.028
Careful.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.369
Easy. Easy.

15:29.371 --> 15:32.406
It's okay. It's okay.

15:32.408 --> 15:33.841
Don't touch that.
Uh, take it easy.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.175
We don't mean you any harm.

15:35.177 --> 15:37.578
No, I said don't touch that.
All right.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.246
Hey, who you looking for,
anyway?

15:39.248 --> 15:41.114
Easy.

15:41.116 --> 15:43.784
I'm fine, all right? No,
you won't be if I don't treat this, okay?

15:43.786 --> 15:46.653
Come on.
Who are you looking for?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.622
Seems only polite.

15:48.624 --> 15:51.024
It was awfully important when you
were pointing a gun at my head.

15:51.026 --> 15:53.627
We were polite.

15:53.629 --> 15:54.928
We brought you in.

15:54.930 --> 15:56.263
We could have left you
out there.

15:56.265 --> 15:57.664
We're looking for somebody, too.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.533
We should be comparing notes,

15:59.535 --> 16:01.835
not trading shots with each other.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.136
You know who's responsible

16:03.138 --> 16:05.505
for those bowel blockades
on the road?

16:07.710 --> 16:10.010
You know what's
on the other side of 'em?

16:11.013 --> 16:12.512
You going to answer
any of my questions?

16:15.985 --> 16:17.317
Whoever it is
you're looking for,

16:17.319 --> 16:18.819
she seemed like
she was trying to get away

16:18.821 --> 16:20.487
from some bad people.

16:20.489 --> 16:22.422
Maybe you just mistook us
for them?

16:22.424 --> 16:24.424
You may not believe it,
but we just want to help.

16:24.426 --> 16:27.160
You can't help me.

16:27.162 --> 16:30.530
No one can.
This whole place is screwed.

16:38.173 --> 16:39.673
Dylan said he was near
a fireworks stand.

16:39.675 --> 16:41.308
<i>Alicia, be smart about this.</i>

16:41.310 --> 16:42.476
They can't be far.

16:42.478 --> 16:45.212
We can't raise john or June.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.281
And we don't know
what we're driving into.

16:47.283 --> 16:50.150
Morgan,
this isn't about me killing.

16:50.152 --> 16:52.853
It isn't about me rushing in
without thinking.

16:52.855 --> 16:54.321
It's about what I should
have said to those kids

16:54.323 --> 16:55.589
back at the...

17:03.198 --> 17:05.065
what the hell was that?!

17:05.067 --> 17:07.667
<i>Alicia?</i>

17:07.670 --> 17:10.137
<i>Luciana, where are you?
Are you okay?</i>

17:27.289 --> 17:30.057
Someone doesn't want us here.

17:30.059 --> 17:31.758
We're okay.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.026
We're getting closer.

17:33.028 --> 17:35.295
<i>We've got to be.</i>

17:35.297 --> 17:36.763
You stay where you are.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.565
I'm coming.

17:43.072 --> 17:45.472
Dylan? Max? Annie?

17:46.642 --> 17:54.715
Dylan. Max. Annie.
Do you copy?

17:54.717 --> 17:57.084
Let's go.

17:57.086 --> 17:58.685
Morgan will catch up.

17:58.687 --> 18:02.556
I don't want to wait
till it's too late again.

18:03.926 --> 18:05.859
Okay?

18:15.537 --> 18:19.673
This is only gonna hold
for so long.

18:19.675 --> 18:22.109
There another way out of here?

18:22.111 --> 18:24.678
Well...

18:24.680 --> 18:26.313
Maybe we can get out
to the roof.

18:26.315 --> 18:29.216
That still leaves the little
matter of hoofing it outta town.

18:32.488 --> 18:35.355
I got a car parked
at the end of the street.

18:35.357 --> 18:38.558
The keys... they're in there.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.827
You can take it,
get out of here.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.064
No.
You're coming with us.

18:44.066 --> 18:47.934
I came at both of you.
I put a gun to your head.

18:47.936 --> 18:49.403
That's true.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.742
And maybe
I'm being presumptuous, but...

18:55.744 --> 18:59.246
It seems to me like
you been separated from someone

18:59.248 --> 19:02.816
as dear to you
as this woman is to me.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.123
We haven't always had the good
fortune of being together.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.893
When I couldn't find June,

19:12.895 --> 19:15.228
I went to a dark place,
just like you.

19:15.230 --> 19:18.899
Hell, I shot a man's finger off

19:18.901 --> 19:22.335
just 'cause I thought he knew
what had happened to her.

19:22.337 --> 19:24.037
It was just his little finger.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.539
And n-not...
Not to shine it out,

19:25.541 --> 19:27.040
but he was
a disagreeable asshole.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.476
But my point is,
if I hadn't have found June,

19:29.478 --> 19:31.244
I might have done
something worse

19:31.246 --> 19:33.213
than what you had tried
to do to us.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.248
So I'm gonna put
what you did behind us,

19:35.250 --> 19:38.085
we're all gonna help each other
get the hell out of here,

19:38.087 --> 19:39.553
and then we're gonna
help you find

19:39.555 --> 19:41.288
whoever it is
you're looking for.

19:41.290 --> 19:44.124
Yeah?

19:46.695 --> 19:49.896
My wife.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.499
I'm looking for my wife.

19:53.602 --> 19:55.035
What's her name?

19:55.037 --> 19:57.737
Sherry.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.073
What's your name?

20:00.075 --> 20:01.741
Dwight.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.711
All right, dwight.

20:04.713 --> 20:06.446
I'm john.

20:06.448 --> 20:08.515
John dorie.

20:10.786 --> 20:12.285
Like the fish?

20:12.287 --> 20:15.856
"I, e," no "y."

20:15.858 --> 20:18.458
and this is June.

20:19.795 --> 20:21.094
Like the month.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.963
Spelled like it, too.

20:24.666 --> 20:26.099
If I give you your gun back,

20:26.101 --> 20:27.667
you gonna point it
at something other than us?

20:27.669 --> 20:30.804
Yeah.

20:30.806 --> 20:32.172
Good.

20:34.443 --> 20:36.576
'cause we're gonna need it.

20:40.182 --> 20:41.414
Ready?

21:29.843 --> 21:31.610
Uh...

21:42.155 --> 21:44.022
this isn't going to hold us all.

21:44.024 --> 21:45.991
We don't have long
till that roll runs out.

21:56.303 --> 21:58.403
Dwight.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.377
Get to the car!

22:06.580 --> 22:08.079
I got you.

22:20.193 --> 22:21.793
I wasn't gonna let us all die
on my account.

22:21.795 --> 22:23.094
Well, neither are we.

22:23.096 --> 22:24.229
Can you make it there?

22:24.231 --> 22:25.497
More walkers?

22:27.100 --> 22:29.934
What'd you call 'em?
Walkers... the dead.

22:29.936 --> 22:31.202
We gotta move.

22:49.923 --> 22:51.589
Aaaah...

22:53.593 --> 22:54.993
You good?

22:54.995 --> 22:57.295
Aah.
You shot me, remember?

22:57.297 --> 22:59.264
Here. There's a navy colt
in there.

22:59.266 --> 23:00.699
Packs a wallop.

23:03.303 --> 23:05.437
Ready?

23:17.284 --> 23:18.883
Start the car!

23:19.820 --> 23:21.252
We're clear.
Let's go.

23:21.254 --> 23:23.288
We can make it.

23:51.651 --> 23:53.551
Where is he?

24:02.863 --> 24:05.029
What the hell is he doing?

24:09.336 --> 24:13.104
Come on, honey.

24:13.106 --> 24:14.773
Where'd you put it?

24:25.385 --> 24:27.285
Come on.

24:29.055 --> 24:31.256
Dwight, dwight, you copy?

24:31.258 --> 24:35.393
<i>Pick up the walkie.</i>

24:35.395 --> 24:38.396
<i>Does that car have something
to do with your wife?</i>

24:38.398 --> 24:40.632
<i>Is that why you came at us
so hard before?</i>

24:43.336 --> 24:44.969
<i>Dwight, do you copy?</i>

24:44.971 --> 24:48.339
<i>Dwight?
Dwight, you hear me?</i>

24:50.210 --> 24:51.676
You should go.

24:51.678 --> 24:55.246
You know, I already got you
in enough trouble.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.950
It's all right, my friend.
Don't worry about it.

24:58.952 --> 25:02.454
Stay calm, all right?

25:15.902 --> 25:20.638
Every time sherry moves
to a new place,

25:20.640 --> 25:23.374
she leaves a message for me.

25:23.376 --> 25:24.776
The last one I found

25:24.778 --> 25:27.045
was written on the registration
for this car.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.813
This is what she was driving.

25:28.815 --> 25:30.915
And I... I thought
I'd find another note,

25:30.917 --> 25:36.688
and there's nothing in here.

25:36.690 --> 25:39.757
<i>You know,
I've been looking for sherry</i>

25:39.759 --> 25:44.896
for... I don't know...
At least a year.

25:44.898 --> 25:47.098
There's been a lot of dead ends.

25:47.100 --> 25:51.336
And this is
the last message I got.

25:51.338 --> 25:54.639
I've been looking
for the car for months.

25:54.641 --> 25:56.841
So...

25:56.843 --> 26:04.582
Please tell me
where you found it.

26:04.584 --> 26:06.150
It was at a campground.

26:06.152 --> 26:07.852
<i>Where?</i>

26:12.526 --> 26:15.126
Where did you find the car?
Tell me.

26:25.071 --> 26:29.173
Dwight, there wasn't anybody...
Anybody there.

26:29.175 --> 26:31.910
Anybody alive, that is.

26:34.281 --> 26:36.014
But that doesn't mean
that she's not out there,

26:36.016 --> 26:37.815
'cause I was somewhere else,
and so was john.

26:43.323 --> 26:44.923
<i>Dwight, do you copy?</i>

26:55.841 --> 26:58.342
<i>Dwight, talk to me.</i>

26:58.344 --> 27:01.345
Uh, you should go, you know,
before they draw more.

27:01.347 --> 27:03.480
No, we're not
leaving you like this.

27:03.482 --> 27:04.782
<i>Leave me.</i>

27:04.784 --> 27:06.917
<i>I'll get through.
Just go.</i>

27:06.919 --> 27:11.221
Dwight, listen,
we're gonna find her.

27:11.223 --> 27:13.357
I found June.

27:13.359 --> 27:15.826
Everybody told me she was dead,
and I found her.

27:15.828 --> 27:17.995
<i>No, I've been
chasing these notes</i>

27:17.997 --> 27:20.597
halfway across the country.

27:20.599 --> 27:25.202
And... and I've always been
two or three steps behind.

27:25.204 --> 27:29.974
<i>And I've been asking myself why
for the longest time.</i>

27:29.976 --> 27:33.677
And I thought it was 'cause,

27:33.679 --> 27:35.679
you know, maybe she...
She had...

27:35.681 --> 27:37.915
She had gotten
a head start on me... Or...

27:37.917 --> 27:43.454
Or... I missed a message
or two...

27:43.456 --> 27:48.292
<i>Or, uh, yeah, I don't...
I don't know... just bad luck.</i>

27:48.294 --> 27:53.297
But... but now... I'm finally
starting to see it.

27:55.534 --> 27:57.901
You don't think you deserve
to find her, huh?

28:00.673 --> 28:03.607
I'm not like you.

28:03.609 --> 28:05.175
Mnh-mnh.

28:05.177 --> 28:08.612
I did, um, things.

28:08.614 --> 28:11.648
<i>Things you can't even imagine.</i>

28:12.752 --> 28:15.052
We all have.

28:15.054 --> 28:16.253
We all have.

28:21.093 --> 28:23.327
Well, I'm still doing things.

28:23.329 --> 28:26.697
You know, I tried to kill you

28:26.699 --> 28:29.233
just 'cause I thought

28:29.235 --> 28:32.970
you had maybe
done something to her.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.472
<i>You know, but you didn't,</i>

28:35.474 --> 28:37.541
and there wasn't even
anything for me in here

28:37.543 --> 28:41.211
to find from her.

28:41.213 --> 28:44.081
I would have killed you
for nothing.

28:44.083 --> 28:48.819
It doesn't matter if...
If she's alive or dead,

28:48.821 --> 28:53.490
because I'm never
going to find her.

28:53.492 --> 28:55.692
<i>I'm never gonna make it right.</i>

28:55.694 --> 28:58.729
That's who I am now.

28:58.731 --> 29:01.165
Then just don't be that person.

29:01.167 --> 29:03.400
'cause what you're thinking
of doing right now...

29:03.402 --> 29:04.868
Giving up like this...

29:04.870 --> 29:06.170
Is just as bad.

29:06.172 --> 29:07.538
Take it easy.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.275
No.
He needs to hear this.

29:11.277 --> 29:12.576
Listen,

29:12.578 --> 29:16.947
<i>you've got
another chance right now.</i>

29:16.949 --> 29:18.382
<i>But you're giving up</i>

29:18.384 --> 29:20.084
<i>'cause you don't think
you deserve it.</i>

29:20.086 --> 29:23.087
<i>I did the exact same thing,
okay?</i>

29:23.089 --> 29:24.521
I ran when I met john

29:24.523 --> 29:26.990
because I didn't think
I deserved what we had.

29:29.829 --> 29:32.362
This is different.

29:32.364 --> 29:33.597
<i>It's no different.</i>

29:33.599 --> 29:34.765
Because john found me,

29:34.767 --> 29:36.300
but he almost got killed
doing it.

29:36.302 --> 29:40.404
Listen,
if sherry's still out there...

29:40.406 --> 29:42.573
And I'm choosing to believe
that she is...

29:42.575 --> 29:45.843
<i>You can't tell
if she's given up, dwight.</i>

29:45.845 --> 29:48.545
<i>It looks like she hasn't.</i>

29:48.547 --> 29:52.149
<i>And if she hasn't, how can you?</i>

30:11.170 --> 30:13.203
<i>You're right.
The only problem is,</i>

30:13.205 --> 30:14.905
I'm not gonna be able
to get back to you.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.413
You leave that to us, buddy.

30:23.415 --> 30:25.749
Dylan? Max? Annie?

30:25.751 --> 30:27.151
Do you copy?

30:30.356 --> 30:32.489
Dylan? Max? Annie?

30:32.491 --> 30:34.024
Do you copy?

30:52.211 --> 30:53.377
Anything?

30:58.417 --> 31:00.284
Keep trying.

31:00.286 --> 31:02.853
Either they don't want to answer
or they can't.

31:02.855 --> 31:04.988
Well, they could still be
listening, though, right?

31:08.127 --> 31:10.394
They could be.

31:11.597 --> 31:13.564
Talk to them, alicia.

31:25.144 --> 31:31.014
Dylan... Annie... Max...

31:31.016 --> 31:37.354
I...
I want to tell you something,

31:37.356 --> 31:39.289
something I should have told you

31:39.291 --> 31:41.058
when I was with you.

31:44.830 --> 31:48.599
I lost my mom.

31:48.601 --> 31:54.071
And my brother.

31:54.073 --> 31:57.841
And I know
how much you're hurting.

31:57.843 --> 32:00.010
And I know how scared you are,

32:00.012 --> 32:01.345
and it's not because
I've been there...

32:01.347 --> 32:03.313
It's because I am there.

32:06.819 --> 32:08.051
And I want you to know

32:08.053 --> 32:10.787
you just don't have
to do it alone.

32:15.628 --> 32:19.396
So, if you are listening...

32:19.398 --> 32:21.632
Tell us where you are,
and we can help you.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.800
I know you may not believe that
right now,

32:23.802 --> 32:26.536
but I promise you,
if you give us the chance...

32:29.174 --> 32:30.674
I think you will.

32:59.204 --> 33:00.637
Let's go.

33:27.232 --> 33:29.566
As soon as
the path is clear, go.

33:36.842 --> 33:38.075
Come to me.

34:03.202 --> 34:04.534
It's jammed!

34:05.871 --> 34:07.571
June!

34:33.098 --> 34:34.464
I'm out!

34:34.466 --> 34:36.132
I got 'em!

34:38.837 --> 34:40.370
Aah!

34:41.639 --> 34:43.106
I got one left.

34:46.512 --> 34:48.078
That's enough.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.554
Dwight! Raise the axe.

34:57.556 --> 35:00.257
Blade toward me!

35:00.259 --> 35:01.591
Raise the axe.

35:08.467 --> 35:10.233
Higher!

35:11.937 --> 35:14.738
Hold it.

35:36.962 --> 35:39.529
Dwight?
Yeah.

35:39.531 --> 35:41.298
You okay?

35:41.300 --> 35:43.266
Yeah.

35:46.003 --> 35:47.471
That's a san antonio split.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.442
Let's stand up.

35:52.444 --> 35:53.844
Come on, friend.

36:00.919 --> 36:02.419
I don't know.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.921
That was only the second time
I ever pulled that off.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.267
It wasn't her car.

36:55.238 --> 36:57.037
I, uh, I checked the vin

36:57.039 --> 36:59.140
against what's on
the registration.

36:59.142 --> 37:00.374
It doesn't match.

37:00.376 --> 37:05.679
So... She could still
be out there.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.615
Or maybe she left
a-another message

37:07.617 --> 37:09.917
in the car she actually drove.

37:11.954 --> 37:13.220
Are you sure?

37:13.222 --> 37:15.723
I used to be a cop.

37:15.725 --> 37:17.224
Law and order's
a thing of the past,

37:17.226 --> 37:19.860
but my training serves a purpose

37:19.862 --> 37:21.428
every once in a while.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.868
Yeah. Thanks.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.137
Yes, sir.

37:47.223 --> 37:50.357
Six-gun sam.

37:50.359 --> 37:51.926
That's what I went by

37:51.928 --> 37:53.928
when I occasionally...

37:53.930 --> 37:56.130
Took part in the theatrics.

38:20.156 --> 38:22.256
And thank you, June.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.892
For what?

38:24.894 --> 38:26.427
What you said to dwight.

38:28.898 --> 38:30.497
He needed to hear it.

38:30.499 --> 38:34.735
I did, too.

38:34.737 --> 38:38.906
I've been questioning
what I have

38:38.908 --> 38:41.575
and, uh, why I deserve it

38:41.577 --> 38:45.412
when I can't share it
with anyone.

38:45.414 --> 38:47.514
But by doubting it,

38:47.516 --> 38:50.884
I'm taking it away
from you and from me.

38:50.886 --> 38:53.754
Neither one of us wants that.

39:07.536 --> 39:09.670
Hey.

39:09.672 --> 39:11.105
How you feeling?

39:11.107 --> 39:14.241
Better.

39:14.243 --> 39:15.676
What is this place?

39:15.678 --> 39:17.778
I used to work
in a place like this,

39:17.780 --> 39:19.480
but I never thought
it would pay dividends

39:19.482 --> 39:20.914
like it has.

39:20.916 --> 39:22.316
Do these still work?

39:22.318 --> 39:24.218
Yeah, there's about
three dozen dead passed

39:24.220 --> 39:26.754
laying in the dirt
who can bear witness.

39:26.756 --> 39:30.224
Morgan?

39:36.132 --> 39:37.564
Dwight?

39:40.002 --> 39:43.270
You two know each other?

39:47.143 --> 39:49.243
We come from the same place.

40:05.428 --> 40:07.428
You take 20?

40:07.430 --> 40:09.830
And then 85.

40:09.832 --> 40:11.999
Yeah.

40:13.035 --> 40:17.004
I was following my old...
My wife sherry's trail.

40:17.006 --> 40:18.372
Once she hit georgia,

40:18.374 --> 40:22.343
everything seemed to...
Drive her this way.

40:23.512 --> 40:25.779
Look, you've gotta understand
something about me,

40:25.781 --> 40:27.147
what happened back there...

40:27.149 --> 40:29.850
You don't have to say it.

40:29.852 --> 40:31.685
Not now.

40:33.055 --> 40:37.725
I know how it ended for you.

40:37.727 --> 40:41.395
But we're all trying
to start over so...

40:45.601 --> 40:47.267
how long you been stuck here?

40:49.538 --> 40:52.606
Longer than I'd hoped.

40:52.608 --> 40:55.943
Do you know who's been leaving
the dead along the road...

40:55.945 --> 40:58.212
What they're keeping us from?

41:00.950 --> 41:03.283
I've only been able
to go so far.

41:03.285 --> 41:06.720
Can you show us?

41:38.587 --> 41:41.255
I've tried to make my way around.

41:41.257 --> 41:45.125
But they're strung up
everywhere.

41:45.127 --> 41:46.927
As far as you can walk.

41:48.431 --> 41:50.164
Not for long.

42:00.276 --> 42:04.178
<i>Alicia?</i>

42:04.180 --> 42:05.979
Max... we're here.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.514
We came for you.
It's going to be okay.

42:07.516 --> 42:08.382
<i>No, no.</i>

42:08.384 --> 42:10.617
<i>Uh, we got your message.</i>

42:10.619 --> 42:12.319
<i>We're... On our way to you.</i>
To us?

42:12.321 --> 42:13.987
<i>To where you took us before.</i>

42:16.192 --> 42:21.795
The truck stop.

42:21.797 --> 42:23.464
We're right behind you.

42:41.283 --> 42:43.517
It's starting to feel like
we're on the right track.

42:43.519 --> 42:46.353
It's starting to feel like
we can make this place better.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.256
Yeah.

42:49.258 --> 42:51.425
I believe we are.

42:58.601 --> 43:00.100
What's that?

43:01.570 --> 43:03.637
That's the van
the kids were driving.

43:03.639 --> 43:05.939
No...

43:17.653 --> 43:19.486
Dylan...

43:23.792 --> 43:26.159
hey. Hey, hey.

43:26.161 --> 43:28.695
It's gonna be okay.

43:28.697 --> 43:30.898
Shh.

43:33.135 --> 43:34.535
Where's max and annie?

43:37.439 --> 43:38.872
Dylan, what happened?

43:56.025 --> 43:58.258
Think they bought it?

43:58.260 --> 44:01.328
Definitely.

44:01.330 --> 44:02.996
Dylan might crack.

44:02.998 --> 44:04.231
He won't.

44:04.233 --> 44:05.699
He knows exactly
what he needs to say.

44:05.701 --> 44:07.868
He's gonna figure out
why they're really here,

44:07.870 --> 44:09.102
who took their friend,

44:09.104 --> 44:12.105
and then we're gonna make sure
they never...

44:12.107 --> 44:13.540
Never bother us ever again.

44:16.545 --> 44:18.011
Dylan's gonna be okay.

44:18.013 --> 44:19.713
You don't have to be scared.

44:19.715 --> 44:21.949
I'm not scared.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.018
Okay.
