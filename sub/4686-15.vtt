00:00.416 --> 00:01.850
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:01.885 --> 00:03.552
<i>Rachel got the lead</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>on Broadway</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:05.120
<i>and they've been rehearsing,</i>
<i>like, forever and now</i>

00:05.155 --> 00:07.289
<i>the show's about to open</i>
<i>and Blaine and Sam and Artie</i>

00:07.323 --> 00:08.857
<i>and Mercedes are all</i>
<i>in New York together.</i>

00:08.892 --> 00:10.626
If you can sing in the middle
of Times Square,

00:10.660 --> 00:12.027
you can pretty much
do anything.

00:12.061 --> 00:13.595
<i>Artie's in film school</i>
<i>and Blaine's in NYADA</i>

00:13.630 --> 00:15.797
<i>and Sam is a model and</i>
<i>Mercedes is recording an album</i>

00:15.832 --> 00:17.366
<i>and Blaine and Sam moved in</i>
<i>with Mercedes.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:20.135
<i>And Sam really wants to go out</i>
<i>with her or go out with her</i>

00:20.170 --> 00:22.504
<i>again because they already went</i>
<i>out and she broke up with him</i>

00:22.539 --> 00:23.906
<i>and sang</i>
<i>"I Will Always Love You"</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:25.240
<i>wearing the world's</i>
<i>most awesome wig.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:26.909
What are we going to do
about our sexual chemistry?

00:26.943 --> 00:28.243
Been there, done that.
No, Sam.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.678
<i>And that's what you missed</i>

03:19.234 --> 03:21.803
I've been in this business
for a very long time.

03:21.837 --> 03:23.404
I produced a lot of shows.

03:23.439 --> 03:25.673
Now, the next two weeks...

03:25.707 --> 03:27.508
tech and previews...

03:27.543 --> 03:29.577
that's when companies
come together

03:29.611 --> 03:31.078
or they fall apart.

03:31.113 --> 03:32.980
Now, people...

03:35.217 --> 03:37.852
I need a hit.

03:37.886 --> 03:40.455
A real, real hit.

03:40.489 --> 03:43.224
So I want you to focus,
I want you to rest,

03:43.258 --> 03:46.961
and I want you to
be the absolute best

03:46.995 --> 03:48.162
that you can be, okay?

03:49.398 --> 03:50.832
The stage is yours now.

03:50.866 --> 03:52.967
If you have any questions,
I'll be in my office.

03:53.001 --> 03:55.436
Sidney, can I just
talk to you for a second?

03:55.471 --> 03:56.704
I have a scheduling conflict,
Huh? What?

03:56.738 --> 03:58.840
And the stage manager said
I should talk to you about it.

03:58.874 --> 03:59.941
It's just a two hour conflict.

03:59.975 --> 04:02.076
Rachel, you're in every scene.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.644
The whole thing is about you.

04:03.679 --> 04:05.813
I understand.
It's just that, um,

04:05.848 --> 04:07.949
well, you see,
that NYADA has been so great

04:07.983 --> 04:09.383
dealing with
the <i>Funny Girl</i> schedule,

04:09.418 --> 04:11.586
so I was just hoping that
we could maybe return the favor.

04:11.620 --> 04:12.887
Please, please.

04:12.921 --> 04:14.422
It's for my Midwinter Critique.

04:14.456 --> 04:16.257
You're killing me.
I-I'm sorry.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.091
Um, it's just a huge part
of my grade.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.327
It's in front of the entire
faculty and students,

04:20.362 --> 04:22.597
and-and if I could just,
you know, make it to this,

04:22.631 --> 04:24.165
then we'll be into performances

04:24.199 --> 04:27.268
and I will be Rachel Berry,
NYADA sophomore by day

04:27.302 --> 04:28.636
and Broadway star by night.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.571
I think
you're overextending yourself.

04:30.606 --> 04:32.540
Oh, no, no, no, no,
look, this-this whole time,

04:32.574 --> 04:34.008
I've been putting up
with my classes

04:34.042 --> 04:35.209
and working at the diner,

04:35.244 --> 04:37.345
and I haven't given you
any less than 150%.

04:37.379 --> 04:39.280
All right, fine.

04:39.314 --> 04:41.883
This is the one exception, okay?

04:41.917 --> 04:43.150
Thank you so much. Thank you.

04:43.185 --> 04:45.065
I really appreciate it.
You're a gem. Thank you.

04:48.156 --> 04:49.690
Edna.

04:51.093 --> 04:52.894
Well, maybe we
should forget our plan...

04:52.895 --> 04:54.028
- Sam?
- What?

04:54.062 --> 04:55.663
Can you turn that down
some please?

04:55.697 --> 04:58.266
Hmm, yeah, sorry.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.600
And don't worry, I'll take...

04:59.635 --> 05:01.035
What the hell
are you watching, anyway.

05:01.069 --> 05:02.203
<i>Facts of Life.</i>

05:02.237 --> 05:03.604
It's amazing; it's about

05:03.639 --> 05:05.373
this old redheaded lady
who runs this boarding school

05:05.407 --> 05:08.109
for lesbians, and then I think
the lesbian school burns down.

05:08.143 --> 05:09.844
The old redheaded lady

05:09.878 --> 05:11.746
opened up this pot dispensary
called Edna's Edibles.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.447
They all work there.

05:13.482 --> 05:15.016
Oh, well, now I'm awake.

05:15.050 --> 05:16.290
You mind if I watch it
with you?

05:16.318 --> 05:17.285
Sure.

05:19.221 --> 05:20.955
Um,

05:20.989 --> 05:22.189
I've always
had trouble sleeping.

05:22.224 --> 05:24.959
So when I moved to New York,
Blaine, um...

05:24.993 --> 05:26.260
you're gonna get a kick
out of this... he

05:26.295 --> 05:27.361
started reading me
<i>Star Wars</i> Fan Fiction

05:27.396 --> 05:29.030
until I got tired.

05:29.064 --> 05:30.798
"'I think young Anakin

05:30.832 --> 05:33.234
"has a diaper full
of midichlorians, R-2,'

05:33.268 --> 05:35.870
"said C-3PO as he bottle-fed
space formula

05:35.904 --> 05:38.773
to the infant Jedi who would
bring balance to the Force."

05:38.807 --> 05:41.075
Whoever wrote this fan fiction
really sucks.

05:41.109 --> 05:42.510
Actually, George Lucas
wrote this one.

05:42.544 --> 05:45.513
Can I ask you, um,
can I ask you a question?

05:45.547 --> 05:46.948
Mm-hmm.

05:46.982 --> 05:49.216
You never told me
why you broke up with me.

05:49.251 --> 05:50.651
Yes, I did.

05:50.686 --> 05:53.354
I told you, I just,
I didn't know who I was,

05:53.388 --> 05:55.656
and until I figured it out,
we just couldn't be together.

05:55.691 --> 05:58.593
I still think
it's a load of crap.

05:58.627 --> 05:59.927
Be real.

05:59.962 --> 06:01.963
I mean, you dated Quinn,

06:01.997 --> 06:04.765
Santana, Brittany,
almost Rachel,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.667
and wasn't that school nurse
you dated,

06:06.702 --> 06:08.169
like, 30?

06:08.203 --> 06:09.971
And there's a rumor
you even made out with Tina.

06:10.005 --> 06:11.672
Wait, Penny the school nurse
is 30?

06:12.674 --> 06:14.075
That's why she got clingy.

06:14.109 --> 06:15.943
You know, I can't
mess around like that.

06:15.978 --> 06:17.678
It's just... It's not me.

06:17.713 --> 06:18.946
I'm not that kind of girl.

06:18.981 --> 06:20.448
Oh.

06:20.482 --> 06:22.183
Well, you know, I feel like

06:22.217 --> 06:25.419
you and I never even got
to figure out what we even had.

06:25.454 --> 06:27.455
It was just, like,
over before it even started.

06:27.489 --> 06:29.790
And now there's this...

06:29.825 --> 06:32.360
obvious chemistry that
I don't know what to do with.

06:32.394 --> 06:34.061
Oh, it's not up
for discussion, Sam.

06:34.096 --> 06:36.197
You asked me a question
and I answered it.

06:36.231 --> 06:39.033
Okay? I just want to watch
the lesbian show about weed

06:39.067 --> 06:40.201
and go back to bed.

06:40.235 --> 06:42.703
Fine. Mmm.

06:42.738 --> 06:46.207
I mean, to launch a ship

06:46.241 --> 06:49.143
when they're about
to close the harbor...

06:55.083 --> 06:56.584
Yes.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.519
Oh, gosh, I'm so excited
that we're all together

06:58.553 --> 07:00.087
for our weekly potluck dinner.

07:00.122 --> 07:01.889
Well, it is only
week number two.

07:01.923 --> 07:03.924
The tradition will be
falling apart in no time.

07:04.926 --> 07:07.294
Hey, um, who's this?

07:08.930 --> 07:10.331
That was, uh, a
neighbor's friend.

07:10.365 --> 07:11.832
He got beat up last week.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.801
That's a nice way of saying
he was gay-bashed.

07:13.835 --> 07:16.037
Apparently he was just
walking down Bleecker Street

07:16.071 --> 07:18.039
and these guys jumped
out of a pickup truck

07:18.073 --> 07:20.441
and just decided to beat him up.

07:20.475 --> 07:22.243
He's lucky to be alive.

07:22.277 --> 07:24.145
It's so depressing.

07:24.179 --> 07:26.714
Like, hate crimes in America
keep decreasing,

07:26.748 --> 07:28.349
but in New York,
they're actually increasing.

07:28.383 --> 07:29.550
Yeah, why?

07:29.584 --> 07:31.686
Well, a few ignorant idiots

07:31.720 --> 07:33.454
just hate the idea that
we're finally being accepted.

07:33.488 --> 07:35.008
They hate the fact
that we're marrying.

07:35.023 --> 07:37.058
They hate the fact that we're
moving into neighborhoods

07:37.092 --> 07:38.225
that are supposedly "straight."

07:38.260 --> 07:40.327
So they lash out
by trying to kill us.

07:40.362 --> 07:42.730
Okay, well, let's
change the subject

07:42.764 --> 07:44.932
before we all get so bummed we can't eat.
Yes, please.

07:44.966 --> 07:48.235
Well, NYADA Midwinter
Critiques are upon us

07:48.270 --> 07:50.271
and our fearless leader,
Madame Tibideaux,

07:50.305 --> 07:51.745
has tightened her turban
and given us

07:51.773 --> 07:53.507
the ultimate
musical theater challenge.

07:53.542 --> 07:54.909
Sondheim!

07:54.943 --> 07:56.110
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

07:56.144 --> 07:57.778
But how are we gonna pick?
It's so hard.

07:57.813 --> 07:58.879
We have to do a duet.

07:58.914 --> 08:00.147
Hold the phone.

08:00.182 --> 08:01.415
Are you two playing footsie?

08:01.450 --> 08:02.817
No.

08:02.851 --> 08:05.553
I have that, uh,
restless legs syndrome.

08:05.587 --> 08:08.289
I just, I forgot to
take my iron pills.

08:08.323 --> 08:10.291
Uh-huh.

08:12.661 --> 08:15.563
I don't know why we always
have to keep this a secret.

08:15.597 --> 08:17.231
What? There's
nothing to keep a secret.

08:17.265 --> 08:19.033
So we're not keeping
anything a secret.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.001
Okay, well, that's bull,
and you know it.

08:21.036 --> 08:22.403
Okay, you know
I've always liked you,

08:22.437 --> 08:24.371
and you clearly have feelings
for me, too.

08:24.406 --> 08:26.640
Sam, you're out
of your tiny little mind.

08:26.675 --> 08:28.743
Okay, come on.
Look around you, okay?

08:28.777 --> 08:30.077
We're not in high
school anymore.

08:30.112 --> 08:32.078
We're adults and we're
in New York City.

08:32.114 --> 08:33.380
Okay, we can finally
be the people

08:33.414 --> 08:35.249
that we always hoped we could
be and do all the things

08:35.283 --> 08:37.351
that we've always
dreamed about doing.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.120
Um, what are you doing?

08:39.154 --> 08:40.855
I want to make a wish.

08:40.889 --> 08:42.857
Are you about to throw a coin
in the East River?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.258
No.

08:44.292 --> 08:45.960
I'm gonna make
a bunch of wishes,

08:45.994 --> 08:47.895
and they're all gonna go
towards the same wish.

08:47.929 --> 08:49.029
Oh, there's a screw.

08:49.064 --> 08:50.931
That you, Mercedes Jones,

08:50.966 --> 08:52.867
will open your eyes

08:52.901 --> 08:54.869
and realize that we're
perfect for each other.

08:57.339 --> 08:59.039
Sam.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.909
What are you doing?

09:01.943 --> 09:03.210
Excuse me.

09:03.245 --> 09:04.478
- Mwah.
- Excuse me.

09:04.513 --> 09:06.914
You can't just throw things
into the river.

09:07.916 --> 09:09.183
Look, Sam.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.851
By the way,
who is gonna tell you

09:10.886 --> 09:12.386
that you shouldn't be wearing
that fur coat?

09:12.420 --> 09:13.487
What? What?

09:13.522 --> 09:15.156
You know how many
animals were killed

09:15.190 --> 09:16.870
to make that coat and
how they were killed?

09:16.892 --> 09:19.093
Okay, it takes a lot of dumb
animals to make a fur coat,

09:19.094 --> 09:20.461
and it only takes
one to wear one.

09:20.495 --> 09:21.729
It's a faux fur, Sam.

09:21.763 --> 09:23.264
It's not real.

09:23.298 --> 09:25.065
Well, that doesn't
matter, okay?

09:25.100 --> 09:26.300
Because it's 2014,

09:26.334 --> 09:28.202
and that coat's
sending a message

09:28.236 --> 09:30.471
that it's okay
to skin animals alive

09:30.505 --> 09:32.306
or electrocute them.

09:32.340 --> 09:34.642
Look, you have a career
to think about.

09:34.676 --> 09:37.011
Is that what you want
your image to be?

09:37.045 --> 09:39.547
Fine. It's not
that cold out anyway.

09:39.581 --> 09:42.016
No, I was... I wasn't serious.
You don't have to...

09:42.050 --> 09:43.284
Oh!

09:44.753 --> 09:47.087
It was your idea.

09:47.122 --> 09:48.255
You see what I'm saying?

09:48.290 --> 09:50.491
We are perfect for each other.

09:50.525 --> 09:51.792
Here, take my coat.

09:51.827 --> 09:52.960
You're gonna freeze, yeah.

09:52.994 --> 09:54.795
Yeah, that was a
bad idea, wasn't it?

09:56.531 --> 09:57.832
Thank you.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.300
Just put it on.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.135
All right, now let's
go do something.

10:01.169 --> 10:02.469
Jump on the train and, uh,

10:02.504 --> 10:04.271
get a hot dog.

10:04.306 --> 10:07.141
No, no, you just...

10:07.175 --> 10:08.642
You go back to the apartment.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.211
I'll meet you in a little bit.

10:10.245 --> 10:12.346
You serious?

10:12.380 --> 10:14.014
Yeah, beat it.

10:14.049 --> 10:16.016
Look, this is just...
It's a lot to take in,

10:16.051 --> 10:17.451
and I have a lot to think about,

10:17.485 --> 10:19.086
so you go back to the apartment.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.955
I'll meet you in a little bit,
I promise.

10:22.657 --> 10:24.859
Okay.

10:25.827 --> 10:27.428
Sam?

10:28.730 --> 10:29.930
If we're gonna do this,

10:29.965 --> 10:31.932
we have to set
some ground rules, okay?

10:31.967 --> 10:33.300
We-we have to take it slow.

10:33.335 --> 10:36.704
Like, you stay
in the living room on the couch,

10:36.738 --> 10:39.006
and I stay in my bedroom.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.441
Could you be okay with that?

10:42.477 --> 10:43.978
For you, yeah.

10:44.012 --> 10:45.079
Yeah, I could do that.

10:45.113 --> 10:46.947

Hold up.

13:06.858 --> 13:08.825
So this is a guy that you dated

13:08.860 --> 13:09.960
in high school?

13:09.994 --> 13:11.161
We didn't really date,
not really.

13:11.195 --> 13:12.596
But... high school?

13:12.630 --> 13:15.098
Mercedes, we just got here.

13:15.132 --> 13:16.933
I just figured out
what subway stop

13:16.968 --> 13:18.502
is closest to my apartment.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.003
You've already
given up on New York

13:20.037 --> 13:22.318
to date some guy
you know from home in Ohio?

13:22.340 --> 13:25.408
Listen, I know
that it sounds weird...

13:25.443 --> 13:26.443
No, this sounds weird.

13:26.477 --> 13:27.744
Clive, it would take me

13:27.778 --> 13:30.113
all day to kiss your fat ass.

13:31.415 --> 13:32.482
That was my impression
of Chris Tucker

13:32.517 --> 13:33.517
doing, uh, Kevin Hart.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.872
No, Kevin Hart
doing Chris Tucker.

13:34.886 --> 13:35.986
It's a work in progress,

13:36.020 --> 13:37.754
but it's gonna be a classic.

13:37.788 --> 13:40.257
Sam, these are my
very good friends

13:40.291 --> 13:41.791
and very talented
backup singers...

13:41.826 --> 13:43.360
- Ooh.
- ...Shaynice

13:43.394 --> 13:45.161
and this is Tesla. Hey.

13:45.196 --> 13:46.963
Okay, I've always
wondered this.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.298
Okay, what is the thing
with hip-hop artists

13:48.332 --> 13:49.599
naming themselves after cars?

13:50.635 --> 13:52.168
Is that a thing?

13:52.203 --> 13:53.436
Okay...

13:53.471 --> 13:55.305
My parents, Rob and Sherry,

13:55.339 --> 13:57.607
named me after the
inventor, Nikola Tesla.

13:57.642 --> 13:59.009
So why don't you ask her?

13:59.043 --> 14:00.210
Oh, yeah, no,
but she's, uh,

14:00.244 --> 14:01.211
she's named after her mom's

14:01.245 --> 14:02.345
favorite actress,
Mercedes Ruehl.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.681
Oh... I forgot
that I told you that.

14:04.715 --> 14:05.815
Steel trap.

14:08.386 --> 14:09.619
So...

14:09.654 --> 14:12.022
So Sam is in New York

14:12.056 --> 14:13.623
to be a model.
Oh.

14:13.658 --> 14:14.624
That's right, yeah.

14:14.659 --> 14:15.959
It's, uh, pretty easy.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.794
You kind of just stand there,
strike a pose.

14:17.828 --> 14:19.195
They ask you to strip
down to your underwear,

14:19.230 --> 14:20.363
not a big deal.

14:20.398 --> 14:22.666
But, uh, yeah, it's fun.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.768
I mean, who doesn't want
to be a model, right?

14:26.203 --> 14:28.171
Um, I'm... gonna
go get a chair.

14:29.774 --> 14:31.174
There's actually
a lot of acting involved.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.410
You'll be standing there
and the photographer

14:33.444 --> 14:35.378
will ask you to feel
some sort of emotion

14:35.413 --> 14:36.713
so you gotta,
you gotta use your brain.

14:36.747 --> 14:38.848
You gotta stop
and you gotta think.

14:38.883 --> 14:40.016
Like, okay, Sam, concentrate.

14:40.051 --> 14:41.952
And it's great.
And then you just, like,

14:41.986 --> 14:43.186
you feel...
you feel that emotion.

14:43.220 --> 14:45.355
So...
how about

14:45.389 --> 14:47.057
we order?
Yes.

14:47.091 --> 14:48.091
I just got a
haircut, also, if anybody

14:48.125 --> 14:49.693
was wondering.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.795
Where is that waitress?

14:51.829 --> 14:53.430
Well, you guys have
beautiful hair. Yeah.

14:53.431 --> 14:55.532
What, is this like a,
is this a, is that weave?

14:55.566 --> 14:56.399
Or is that real? What?

14:56.434 --> 14:57.267
Oh, God.

14:57.301 --> 14:59.970
No, actually, um...

15:00.004 --> 15:01.771
both of us have real hair.

15:01.806 --> 15:04.107
- Oh!
- Yeah. Mercedes, too.

15:04.141 --> 15:06.710
Yeah. She is also

17:43.901 --> 17:45.935
Excellent performance.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.303
Or it would've been,

17:47.338 --> 17:50.073
had the assignment been a duet.

17:50.107 --> 17:51.775
Apparently, you both feel

17:51.809 --> 17:53.610
that you are above this class

17:53.644 --> 17:55.044
and all that governs it.

17:55.079 --> 17:57.413
No, not-not at all,
Madame Tibideaux...

17:57.448 --> 17:58.481
I'm flunking you both.

17:58.516 --> 18:00.617
Next!

18:02.286 --> 18:04.287
Wait.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.991
It <i>was</i> a good performance,

18:08.025 --> 18:10.160
so I'm going to give you
the opportunity

18:10.194 --> 18:12.695
to give me what
I asked for originally.

18:12.730 --> 18:15.331
I want you to do it
as individuals.

18:15.366 --> 18:17.133
Reschedule this week,

18:17.168 --> 18:18.301
it's fine.

18:18.335 --> 18:20.503
Um, I'm sorry,
Madame Tibideaux.

18:20.538 --> 18:22.105
I'm just... I'm in the middle

18:22.139 --> 18:23.773
of tech rehearsals
for my show right now...

18:23.808 --> 18:26.776
Ms. Berry, I've said everything
I have to say to you.

18:26.811 --> 18:28.678
Either you do it this week,
or you fail.

18:28.712 --> 18:30.613
That's it. Next!

18:30.648 --> 18:32.649
Please get off my stage.

18:34.118 --> 18:35.919
Madame Tibideaux?

18:35.953 --> 18:37.053
Do you have a moment?

18:37.087 --> 18:38.822
If it's to reschedule

18:38.856 --> 18:40.757
your Midwinter Critique,
then yes.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.159
Otherwise, no,
I'm interviewing Mike Nichols

18:43.194 --> 18:45.328
at the 92nd Street Y
at 5:30.

18:45.362 --> 18:47.463
Um, so I was just hoping

18:47.498 --> 18:48.631
that we could maybe reschedule

18:48.666 --> 18:49.833
for after my opening night.

18:51.268 --> 18:53.903
I thought I was very
clear about that.

18:53.938 --> 18:56.439
It's either this week
or you fail.

18:56.473 --> 18:57.874
I thought that
the appeal of NYADA

18:57.908 --> 18:59.008
was that we could explore

18:59.043 --> 19:00.210
other activities,
outside of the school.

19:00.244 --> 19:01.311
Yes.

19:01.345 --> 19:02.946
As long as you kept
your studies up.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.681
But I've spoken
to your professors

19:04.715 --> 19:06.015
and they say you
are underperforming

19:06.050 --> 19:07.350
egregiously.

19:07.384 --> 19:08.618
I'm sorry, who said that?

19:08.652 --> 19:10.420
- All of them.
- Uh... g...

19:10.454 --> 19:12.188
I have put up with
every single thing

19:12.223 --> 19:13.544
that this school
has thrown at me,

19:13.557 --> 19:15.658
including that lunatic
Cassandra July.

19:15.693 --> 19:18.862
Ms. Berry, you are
barely scraping by

19:18.896 --> 19:20.997
and you have the nerve
to come in here

19:21.031 --> 19:23.800
and ask for special treatment
when you haven't earned it?

19:23.834 --> 19:26.194
I'm sorry, I don't understand
why you're being so difficult.

19:26.737 --> 19:29.305
It is <i>not</i> just a critique.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.242
This is about you deciding:

19:32.276 --> 19:33.910
are you part of this community?

19:33.944 --> 19:36.346
Do you want to get your degree?

19:36.380 --> 19:38.414
Do you care about the work,

19:38.449 --> 19:41.885
or is it just about
the spotlight?

19:41.919 --> 19:43.353
That's what you have to decide.

19:43.387 --> 19:44.988
I did decide,

19:45.022 --> 19:46.522
and I chose I would do
whatever it takes

19:46.557 --> 19:47.790
to make it to Broadway,

19:47.825 --> 19:49.626
and that is why I fought
so hard to get into NYADA,

19:49.660 --> 19:51.527
to help all of
my dreams come true,

19:51.562 --> 19:52.729
and they have.

19:52.763 --> 19:54.364
I-I am in my...
my dream show,

19:54.398 --> 19:55.865
playing my dream part,

19:55.900 --> 19:57.567
and I'm not going to turn
my back on that, I'm sorry.

19:57.601 --> 19:59.569
Oh, come on, little girl.

19:59.603 --> 20:01.337
You are not the first supernova

20:01.372 --> 20:02.505
to come through here.

20:02.539 --> 20:05.742
You... are talented.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.577
You have drive.

20:07.611 --> 20:08.912
What you don't have

20:08.946 --> 20:10.079
is you have no foundation.

20:10.114 --> 20:11.347
You don't listen

20:11.382 --> 20:12.715
and you don't take direction.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.384
That's why you need NYADA.

20:14.418 --> 20:16.886
You're not ready.

20:18.789 --> 20:21.024
You're wrong.

20:21.058 --> 20:22.859
You're wrong and
I'm going to prove it to you.

20:22.860 --> 20:23.960
Okay?

20:23.994 --> 20:25.261
I don't need NYADA anymore.

20:25.296 --> 20:28.231
Especially not if
it's going to hold me back.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.803
Think long and hard...

20:33.837 --> 20:36.439
about what you're
gonna say next.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.376
I have.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.412
I quit.

20:48.170 --> 20:49.415
Look, he's very nice.

20:49.434 --> 20:50.760
Nobody's saying
that he's not nice.

20:50.779 --> 20:52.832
Yeah, and his impressions
were really good.

20:52.867 --> 20:54.201
His Bill Cosby impression?

20:54.235 --> 20:55.302
Spot on.

20:55.336 --> 20:57.571
His impression of all
the Cosbys were good.

20:57.605 --> 21:00.307
And I don't think a Tempestt
Bledsoe impression is easy.

21:00.341 --> 21:02.221
- I'm surprised he found a toehold there.
- Me, too.

21:02.243 --> 21:04.611
All right. Well...

21:04.645 --> 21:06.179
what's the problem?

21:06.214 --> 21:08.448
Shaynice, can we just
stop skating around it

21:08.482 --> 21:10.450
and talk for real?

21:10.484 --> 21:11.785
Mercedes...

21:11.819 --> 21:13.787
you're black, and he's white.

21:13.821 --> 21:15.155
Period.

21:15.189 --> 21:17.290
Girl, he's not just
white, he's blond.

21:17.325 --> 21:18.758
He's practically albino.

21:18.793 --> 21:20.427
You can see the veins
in his temples.

21:20.461 --> 21:23.096
If you date a white dude,

21:23.130 --> 21:24.598
you're gonna alienate
all the black women

21:24.632 --> 21:26.166
you want to buy your album

21:26.200 --> 21:27.901
and you're gonna
piss off black men, too.

21:27.935 --> 21:29.970
The only people who will
buy your record are albinos.

21:30.004 --> 21:31.438
Well,

21:31.472 --> 21:33.139
maybe I don't care.

21:33.174 --> 21:34.140
Fine.

21:34.175 --> 21:35.408
Maybe you don't,

21:35.443 --> 21:36.443
but you should.

21:53.327 --> 21:54.361
Oh...

21:54.395 --> 21:55.695
"Well, you take the good
you take the bad,

21:55.730 --> 21:56.696
"you take them both and

21:56.731 --> 21:58.298
there you have
the facts of life."

21:58.332 --> 22:00.233
Oh, I don't know what
it is about Mrs. Garrett.

22:00.268 --> 22:01.701
She just does it for me.

22:01.736 --> 22:03.703
Natalie, you
always do well on your tests.

22:03.738 --> 22:05.238
But what if I don't?

22:05.273 --> 22:06.873
I can't do this.

22:06.907 --> 22:09.042
What? What do you,
what do you mean?

22:09.076 --> 22:10.543
I can't be with you.

22:10.578 --> 22:12.379
I can't date you
or be your girlfriend

22:12.413 --> 22:14.014
or whatever.
It was dinner, wasn't it?

22:14.048 --> 22:14.881
No.

22:17.218 --> 22:19.219
Nah, you know, I,
you know, I just, uh,

22:19.253 --> 22:22.289
when I get nervous I can't
stop talking and now you...

22:22.323 --> 22:24.291
your backup singers probably,
they hate me, don't they?

22:24.325 --> 22:25.458
No...

22:25.493 --> 22:26.493
They don't...

22:26.527 --> 22:27.494
they don't hate you.

22:27.528 --> 22:28.895
They like you just fine.

22:28.929 --> 22:31.965
I'm just worried about what
people are gonna think.

22:31.999 --> 22:34.534
Okay, well, then...

22:34.568 --> 22:35.702
I'm gonna ask you something,

22:35.736 --> 22:39.172
and I want you
to be honest with me.

22:39.206 --> 22:41.207
Does it have anything
to do with the fact

22:41.242 --> 22:43.843
that you're black and I'm white?

22:43.878 --> 22:46.780
I mean, think about it, Sam.

22:46.814 --> 22:50.650
How many black female artists
do you see dating white dudes?

22:50.685 --> 22:53.253
Because I've been thinking
about it all day

22:53.287 --> 22:54.688
and I can't think of one.

22:54.722 --> 22:56.356
What white folks
don't understand

22:56.390 --> 22:59.192
is people pay attention
to that kind of stuff.

22:59.226 --> 23:01.127
It's making a statement.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.996
And I'm not sure
if that's the statement

23:03.030 --> 23:04.664
that I want to make, not now.

23:04.699 --> 23:05.665
I can't believe
you're saying this.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.666
Okay, you know what?

23:06.701 --> 23:08.234
This, this isn't you,

23:08.269 --> 23:09.936
Mercedes, okay?
When we were in Glee Club,

23:09.970 --> 23:11.370
there-there were
all different types

23:11.372 --> 23:13.540
of people... there was gay,
straight, black, white,

23:13.574 --> 23:15.408
Tina, it didn't matter we would...
Sam.

23:15.443 --> 23:17.410
We are not
in high school anymore.

23:17.445 --> 23:19.446
Okay? We're not in Glee Club.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.748
Okay? This is
the real world.

23:21.782 --> 23:23.116
That's all that we have.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.952
And the real world has rules.

23:25.986 --> 23:28.221
And I'm sorry, Sam, I really am.

23:28.255 --> 23:30.123
But this is just the way it is.

23:32.426 --> 23:34.928
You and I are not a couple.

23:34.962 --> 23:37.630
And I think you should move out.

23:51.712 --> 23:54.080
Hi! Thank you.

23:54.115 --> 23:56.349
Sorry that I'm late.

23:56.384 --> 23:57.617
I know what you did.

23:57.651 --> 23:58.618
You're crazy.

23:58.652 --> 24:01.020
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

24:01.055 --> 24:02.055
You really already

24:02.089 --> 24:03.656
- heard about that?
- Seriously?

24:03.691 --> 24:04.924
The gossip chain at NYADA is

24:04.959 --> 24:06.439
the most efficient
part of the school.

24:06.460 --> 24:07.827
Okay, look, don't judge me.
It was the right thing to do.

24:07.862 --> 24:08.895
How can you say that?

24:08.929 --> 24:09.896
Two years ago you would've done

24:09.930 --> 24:10.964
anything humanly possible

24:10.998 --> 24:11.998
to force your way
into that school.

24:12.032 --> 24:13.233
And-and now you're
just gonna quit?

24:13.267 --> 24:15.268
Oh, my God, that was
before Fanny, okay?

24:15.302 --> 24:17.103
Everything changed
from that moment on.

24:17.138 --> 24:19.305
I understand that,
but an education from NYADA

24:19.340 --> 24:20.907
will give you options
in the future.

24:20.941 --> 24:22.275
Okay? Broadway is
a fickle business.

24:22.309 --> 24:24.010
What if this is
the last role you ever get?

24:24.044 --> 24:26.212
"Last role"? Really? Wow.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.647
You are worse than Carmen.

24:27.681 --> 24:29.516
Is that honestly
what you think of me?

24:29.550 --> 24:32.318
Of course not. I'm just saying
you need to be smart about this.

24:32.328 --> 24:33.929
Okay, look, Kurt,
I'm just not interested

24:33.954 --> 24:36.122
in spending huge sums
of money on a school

24:36.157 --> 24:37.957
whose classes
I can barely even attend

24:37.992 --> 24:39.959
and a dean who doesn't
like me or support me.

24:39.994 --> 24:42.095
Yeah, that's not what it is.
She's just...

24:42.129 --> 24:43.530
We can play
the "what if" game all day long.

24:43.564 --> 24:45.432
But the point is that I have
the opportunity of a lifetime

24:45.466 --> 24:47.934
staring me in the face right now
and I can't let anything,

24:47.968 --> 24:50.370
whether it-it's school
or Carmen or the diner or..

24:50.404 --> 24:52.472
You know,
even my friends stop me

24:52.506 --> 24:54.040
from accomplishing my dreams.

24:54.074 --> 24:55.375
Okay, for the last time,
ch, I am begging you.

24:55.409 --> 24:56.709
Please don't do this.

24:56.744 --> 24:58.878
You know, I am so hurt right now

24:58.913 --> 25:01.247
that you are standing
in the corner with a failure

25:01.282 --> 25:03.716
like Carmen Tibideaux
and not your best friend.

25:03.751 --> 25:05.985
I'm not on Carmen's side!
I'm on your side!

25:06.020 --> 25:07.287
No, you're afraid, okay?

25:07.321 --> 25:08.688
You're afraid to venture out.

25:08.722 --> 25:09.756
You need a place like NYADA,

25:09.790 --> 25:12.492
where it's just
one big safe group,

25:12.526 --> 25:13.860
and no one takes any risks.

25:13.894 --> 25:14.861
That way, you guys

25:14.895 --> 25:16.095
can just avoid the fact

25:16.130 --> 25:18.364
of actually having
to grow up and be an adult.

25:18.399 --> 25:19.599
Screw you, Rachel.

25:19.633 --> 25:22.101
Wow. Okay.

25:27.541 --> 25:29.342
Help!

25:29.376 --> 25:31.077
Help, help!

25:31.111 --> 25:33.213
Help!

25:33.247 --> 25:34.214
Help!
Shut up, faggot!

25:34.248 --> 25:35.682
Hey!

25:35.716 --> 25:37.484
Hey!

25:37.518 --> 25:38.751
Get off of him!

25:38.786 --> 25:39.886
Hey, look.
What is wrong with you?!

25:39.920 --> 25:40.887
There's two of them now.

25:40.921 --> 25:42.922
Yeah, even numbers!

25:42.957 --> 25:45.258
What is wrong with you?!

25:45.292 --> 25:47.427
What decade are you from, huh?
I'm not afraid of you!

25:47.461 --> 25:49.762
You're just a bunch of cowards!

25:55.503 --> 25:57.504
Come on!

26:06.958 --> 26:08.478
I mean, she just turned
and walked out.

26:08.503 --> 26:09.770
It was like
some horrible nightmare.

26:09.805 --> 26:11.339
I'm sorry, buddy.

26:11.373 --> 26:13.040
Wish I knew what to say.

26:13.075 --> 26:14.575
I mean, because I'm too white,
can you believe it?

26:14.610 --> 26:16.577
Like, I'm telling you
it's really hard

26:16.612 --> 26:18.079
to be a straight
white male these days.

26:18.113 --> 26:20.615
We should probably
change the subject.

26:20.649 --> 26:21.983
Hey, look on the bright side.

26:22.017 --> 26:23.718
We get to look for
our own place now.

26:23.752 --> 26:26.020
And, hey, I can give you
your old kazoo back.

26:26.054 --> 26:27.588
Remember this guy?

26:27.623 --> 26:28.956
Remember that?
Anytime you're feeling down,

26:28.991 --> 26:30.224
and you have trouble sleeping,

26:30.259 --> 26:31.692
just give that thing
a little toot,

26:31.727 --> 26:32.693
and I'll read you

26:32.728 --> 26:34.228
some <i>Star Wars</i> Fan Fiction!

26:34.263 --> 26:35.263
No, I don't really want to.

26:35.297 --> 26:36.197
Come on, it'll be fun!

26:36.231 --> 26:37.798
Hey, I just read a Web site

26:37.833 --> 26:40.268
all about Ewoks
and how they're polygamists.

26:40.302 --> 26:42.136
How is that fan fin?
Of course they're polygamists.

26:42.170 --> 26:43.604
That's obvious.
Hold on.

26:43.639 --> 26:45.206
Watch this, it's crazy.

26:48.610 --> 26:49.710
Hello?

26:49.745 --> 26:51.379
May I speak
to Mr. Blaine Anderson, please?

26:51.413 --> 26:53.247
Yeah, this is Blaine.

26:53.282 --> 26:54.715
Mr. Anderson,
do you know a Kurt Hummel?

26:57.519 --> 27:00.054
Sam, I don't want
to talk right now.

27:06.762 --> 27:08.996
Hey, what's up, girl?

27:10.499 --> 27:12.400
I know we're not
supposed to change the lines.

27:12.434 --> 27:14.902
I just, like, don't feel
like Fanny would say this.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.304
Just why don't...?
I'll-I'll do it

27:17.773 --> 27:19.106
And why don't you
just let me...?

27:19.141 --> 27:21.309
I'm sorry.
Rachel, phone call.

27:21.343 --> 27:23.644
They say it's urgent.
I'm sorry, one second.

27:23.679 --> 27:26.113
Hello?

27:26.148 --> 27:27.748
Kurt's been in an accident.

27:32.521 --> 27:34.121
Oh...

27:34.156 --> 27:35.523
Is he okay?
Is he awake yet?

27:35.557 --> 27:36.958
I have no idea.
They won't tell me anything.

27:36.992 --> 27:38.960
I'm not family.

27:40.796 --> 27:42.863
Is he okay?

27:42.898 --> 27:45.232
He has a hairline fracture
above his right eye socket.

27:45.267 --> 27:47.234
Some other cuts and bruising.

27:47.269 --> 27:49.971
And he will be okay.

27:50.005 --> 27:51.272
Now, he's sleeping now
from the morphine,

27:51.306 --> 27:53.307
but you can see him.

27:57.145 --> 27:58.646
Hey, Kurt, hey.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.880
I know you're on a lot
of painkillers, buddy,

27:59.915 --> 28:01.649
but you can wake up.

28:01.683 --> 28:04.418
Sam, just leave him be.

28:04.453 --> 28:06.520
I just feel so responsible.
We had this huge fight.

28:06.555 --> 28:08.289
And then I just
left him all alone.

28:08.323 --> 28:11.192
If you'd been with him,
he would've done the same thing.

28:11.226 --> 28:12.927
I want to kill
whoever did this to him.

28:12.961 --> 28:13.961
Don't say that, Sam.

28:13.996 --> 28:14.996
You don't mean that.

28:19.668 --> 28:22.703
I just wish he could hear me.

28:22.738 --> 28:25.606
So I could tell him I was here.

28:30.412 --> 28:32.947
He knows we're here.

28:32.981 --> 28:34.982
He does.

So, this is it, huh?

30:12.673 --> 30:14.040
Yup.

30:14.074 --> 30:16.142
I mean, Aretha Franklin,

30:16.176 --> 30:18.778
Ray Charles, Coltrane,

30:18.812 --> 30:20.513
Chaka Khan, Thelonious Monk,

30:20.547 --> 30:22.048
they all recorded here.

30:22.082 --> 30:24.417
Now, Mercedes Jones.

30:24.451 --> 30:26.686
Yeah, that's right.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.388
You know,

30:29.423 --> 30:30.423
I've been thinking

30:30.457 --> 30:33.459
a lot about
our last conversation.

30:33.494 --> 30:35.294
Yeah, me, too.

30:35.329 --> 30:37.330
You had some good points.

30:37.364 --> 30:38.931
But I did, too.

30:41.268 --> 30:43.136
I can't pretend
that dating a white guy

30:43.170 --> 30:45.671
is not something that people
aren't going to notice.

30:45.706 --> 30:48.641
But then it occurred
to me that it's...

30:48.675 --> 30:51.644
so messed up that I even
took that into consideration.

30:51.678 --> 30:54.547
Me not dating someone
because they're white

30:54.581 --> 30:56.015
is like me telling someone

30:56.049 --> 30:58.151
I-I can't be their friend
because they're gay.

30:58.185 --> 30:59.819
I'm not gay.

30:59.853 --> 31:01.487
I know you're not gay, Sam.

31:03.991 --> 31:06.592
I don't really have
that much to say.

31:06.627 --> 31:11.330
I kind of just wanted to sing
about the way I feel.

31:11.365 --> 31:12.798

Hey.

35:12.339 --> 35:13.539
Kurt, what were you thinking?

35:15.509 --> 35:17.443
I mean, I know
what you were thinking, but...

35:17.477 --> 35:18.778
who do you think you are,

35:18.812 --> 35:21.013
<i>Die Hard</i> or Charles Bronson
or something?

35:21.047 --> 35:22.515
Those guys could've had a gun.

35:22.549 --> 35:23.716
What would you have done?

35:23.750 --> 35:24.984
Just run, like they tell us?

35:25.018 --> 35:26.252
I played football, Kurt.

35:26.286 --> 35:27.153
So did I.

35:27.187 --> 35:28.154
As a kicker!

35:28.188 --> 35:29.422
That's the same attitude

35:29.456 --> 35:30.456
that makes these guys think

35:30.490 --> 35:31.557
that they can do
whatever they want.

35:31.591 --> 35:32.558
Oh, come on.

35:32.592 --> 35:34.026
You could've called the cops...

35:34.060 --> 35:35.561
you could've gotten help...

35:38.568 --> 35:40.008
Now, look, I'm proud
of what you did,

35:40.033 --> 35:41.133
but come on, man.

35:41.168 --> 35:42.334
Use your head!

35:42.369 --> 35:45.004
You realize how lucky you are?

35:45.038 --> 35:46.806
And what are you saying about

35:46.840 --> 35:48.274
that other gay kid that
you saved that night?

35:48.308 --> 35:49.675
He's... he isn't brave?

35:49.709 --> 35:51.610
He's not as strong as you?

35:51.645 --> 35:53.379
I don't know what his story is.

35:53.413 --> 35:54.680
I only know what mine is.

35:54.714 --> 35:56.215
And I've been
fighting these guys

35:56.249 --> 35:58.584
for a really long time.

36:01.354 --> 36:03.355
I've been fighting, too.

36:03.390 --> 36:05.391
Okay?

36:12.332 --> 36:13.299
I don't know, man.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.334
I mean, it's just, uh...

36:18.038 --> 36:20.039
I can't believe that
this happened here.

36:21.975 --> 36:23.809
You know?
I mean, this is New York City.

36:23.844 --> 36:25.845
I mean, come on,
this isn't Kansas.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.680
Am I an idiot

36:27.714 --> 36:29.315
because I thought
you'd be safe here?

36:29.349 --> 36:30.683
<i>Safer?</i>

36:32.986 --> 36:34.620
Look at your beautiful face.

36:34.654 --> 36:35.788
I'm not upset

36:35.822 --> 36:37.556
about it, actually.

36:37.591 --> 36:39.291
Kind of hoping for a scar.

36:39.326 --> 36:40.493
Is that weird?

36:40.527 --> 36:42.027
Yes.

36:42.062 --> 36:43.195
It's weird.

36:43.230 --> 36:45.998
I hurt, just...
not on the inside.

36:46.032 --> 36:47.867
And you know what?

36:48.902 --> 36:51.403
Now I know who I am,
without a doubt.

36:51.438 --> 36:52.972
You know who that is?

36:53.006 --> 36:54.974
Is it Braveheart?

36:55.008 --> 36:57.176
Your son.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.211
The man you raised.

37:05.085 --> 37:07.086
I'm glad you're okay.

37:10.257 --> 37:12.258
Just... don't do it again.

37:13.627 --> 37:15.127
Unless I'm right next to you.

37:16.563 --> 37:18.364
We'll take 'em together?

37:23.758 --> 37:24.725
Hey.

37:24.759 --> 37:26.226
Are you sure
you're up for this?

37:26.260 --> 37:27.394
You just got
out of the hospital.

37:27.428 --> 37:28.962
You don't have to do this.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.797
I do.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.833
And I want to.

37:49.717 --> 37:52.152
I heard he woke up.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.287
I heard he's gonna be okay.

38:12.173 --> 38:14.174
Can I come in?

38:19.571 --> 38:22.091
You know, just because you said
you were gonna drop out of NYADA

38:22.116 --> 38:23.717
doesn't mean you have
to go through with it.

38:23.751 --> 38:25.952
I've made my decision.
Okay?

38:25.987 --> 38:27.954
College just isn't for me.

38:27.989 --> 38:29.623
Because it's too safe?

38:31.595 --> 38:33.836
Because it's for people like me
who never take any risks?

38:33.861 --> 38:35.295
I'm sorry. I...

38:35.329 --> 38:37.330
I should never have said that.

38:38.833 --> 38:41.368
It's okay.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.737
We've had worse
arguments than that.

38:45.907 --> 38:47.841
Kurt, I, um...

38:47.875 --> 38:50.343
look, I'll say it
till the day I die:

38:50.378 --> 38:52.712
you're the most talented person
that I've ever met,

38:52.747 --> 38:55.348
and you've taken more risks
in your life

38:55.383 --> 38:58.718
than I ever have
or ever will and...

38:58.753 --> 39:00.787
I just... I don't want
another minute to go by

39:00.822 --> 39:02.689
without telling you
that I love you.

39:02.723 --> 39:04.157
And you're my best friend

39:04.192 --> 39:06.293
and I'm just glad
that you're okay.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.361
God, you're sappy.

39:10.631 --> 39:13.333
But you're my best friend, too.

39:13.367 --> 39:14.768
And you know I love you.

39:14.802 --> 39:17.504
Okay.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.476
- All right.
- Monday night potluck, yo!

39:22.510 --> 39:23.643
Let's go have some food.

39:23.678 --> 39:24.644
Hi!

39:24.679 --> 39:26.046
What's up, everybody?

39:26.080 --> 39:27.380
Mercedes and I have
an announcement.

39:27.415 --> 39:28.381
Drumroll, please.

39:28.416 --> 39:30.884
Well, Sam and I...

39:30.918 --> 39:33.186
We are officially dating again.

39:33.221 --> 39:35.722
Wait. Were you guys
ever really dating?

39:35.756 --> 39:36.857
- Mm, not really.
- Yeah.

39:36.891 --> 39:38.191
Yeah, your relationship

39:38.226 --> 39:39.626
has always been kind of weird.

39:39.660 --> 39:40.961
Okay, that's racist.

39:40.995 --> 39:41.995
No, they're right,

39:42.029 --> 39:44.164
because you guys
had that summer fling

39:44.198 --> 39:46.266
and then you moved away
and then you came back

39:46.300 --> 39:48.468
and then you dated for a
few more weeks, but...

39:48.503 --> 39:50.403
I mean, I don't think any of
us ever saw any chemistry.

39:50.438 --> 39:52.372
Okay, how's this for chemistry?

39:52.406 --> 39:53.573
Ooh! Oh...

39:53.608 --> 39:55.775
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.244
Well, um, I have an
announcement to make.

39:57.278 --> 39:58.845
Yes, we know. <i>Funny Girl
</i> starts in two weeks.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.180
You've been tweeting
about it every day.

40:00.214 --> 40:01.615
- Yes.
- No.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.050
So Kurt is singing
tomorrow at NYADA

40:04.085 --> 40:05.485
for his Midwinter Critique.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.220
And it's really
important for his grade,

40:07.255 --> 40:09.422
and although I won't be
attending the school anymore,

40:09.457 --> 40:11.992
I will be there in support,

40:12.026 --> 40:13.126
and to also witness

40:13.161 --> 40:14.928
what will undoubtedly be
an amazing performance.

40:14.962 --> 40:16.463
So I really hope that you guys

40:16.497 --> 40:18.398
can be there and join me.

40:18.432 --> 40:20.634
Well, I don't know about
the rest of you fools,

40:20.668 --> 40:22.669
but I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

40:22.703 --> 40:23.670
To Kurt.

40:23.704 --> 40:24.671
To Kurt!

40:24.705 --> 40:26.139
To Kurt. To Kurt. To Kurt.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.174
To Kurt.

40:28.709 --> 40:30.043
Cheers, buddy.
