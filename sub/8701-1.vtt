07:25.745 --> 07:28.749
don't get all teary-eyed

we could make ourselves

23:07.886 --> 23:09.126
(LAUGHS)

23:27.506 --> 23:28.780
(GREETING IN FRENCH)

23:31.443 --> 23:32.581
(GRUNTS)

23:36.848 --> 23:38.623
You look like shit.

23:40.185 --> 23:43.223
The magic cocktail
is already
whispering in your ear.

23:43.889 --> 23:45.129
Why are you doing this?

23:45.624 --> 23:47.160
What's your name?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.670
David Lord.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.810
What were you going
to name your child?

24:00.872 --> 24:02.681
Leave my family
out of this.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.881
Your wife, she's pretty.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.451
Such a pity she's gone.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.966
In the Marines,
how many men, women
and children did you kill?

24:19.591 --> 24:21.070
No matter.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.197
'Cause you aren't prepared
for what's about to happen.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.076
Whether you live or die.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.036
How will you live or die?

24:33.038 --> 24:34.346
It's your choice.

24:36.908 --> 24:38.080
What?

24:39.978 --> 24:40.979
You want me?

24:41.046 --> 24:42.150
I'd love to get
my hands on you.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.852
That's the spirit.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.795
No, no, no, no!

24:54.392 --> 24:55.393
(BUZZING)

25:25.323 --> 25:26.358
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

25:26.424 --> 25:28.870
New guy doesn't
stand a chance.

25:30.228 --> 25:31.400
Yoshi.

25:32.163 --> 25:35.167
We need to talk
about your TPS reports.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.310
Yeah. The cover sheets.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.740
I know. I know.

25:54.252 --> 25:57.529
Ahh. Home again, home again.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.868
And how are my two
beauties this fine day?

26:01.860 --> 26:03.237
Ready to go.
Ready to go.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.706
Magnificent.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.436
Let's make something
special, shall we?

26:11.469 --> 26:13.073
THE EXECUTIONER:
What is your name?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.147
David Lord.

26:22.714 --> 26:26.753
No. Your name is
Death Dealer.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.963
Now I'm gonna
ask you again.

26:30.088 --> 26:34.537
What is your name?

26:39.898 --> 26:41.377
Input a six-second delay.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.137
Link the video screen.

26:45.403 --> 26:46.882
Ladies, if you will.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.083
Lights.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.121
Lay in graphics.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.291
Marvelous!

26:58.950 --> 27:02.762
Outstanding.
You've outdone yourselves,
my little pearls.

27:03.121 --> 27:08.969
We are going live
in three, two, one.
Cue music.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.741
(MUSIC PLAYING)

27:43.228 --> 27:45.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm not gonna fight!

27:49.134 --> 27:50.670
Boring.

28:01.646 --> 28:02.647
(GRUNTING)

28:20.865 --> 28:21.866
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

28:21.933 --> 28:22.934
What a coward.

28:23.068 --> 28:26.072
If I was a betting man,
Milla, and I am,

28:26.137 --> 28:28.640
I'd say you're
going to lose this one.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.134
CRAIG: Oh, no.
Get up, get up, get up!

28:50.895 --> 28:52.499
Ladies, please,
do something.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.566
My lids are getting heavy.
I'm falling asleep here.

29:25.563 --> 29:26.598
CRAIG: Yeah!

29:26.664 --> 29:27.665
RICK: Oh, dude.

29:30.735 --> 29:31.736
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

29:31.836 --> 29:33.247
He's shit.

29:34.305 --> 29:35.306
What?

29:44.549 --> 29:45.550
(SCREAMS)

29:45.617 --> 29:48.188
Oh! Well, I'll be damned.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.088
(BONE CRUNCHING)
(GROANING)

29:57.428 --> 29:59.499
Oh, my God!

29:59.898 --> 30:03.402
It is now time for
the Fan-atics to vote.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.281
Survey says...

30:08.039 --> 30:11.282
Mr. Executioner,
come on down!

30:11.442 --> 30:14.286
I'm a paramedic.
I'm gonna stop the bleeding.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.019
What's he doing?

30:18.216 --> 30:20.025
I've got a child.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.230
I'm David Lord and
I've been kidnapped!

30:26.391 --> 30:27.529
(BUZZING)

30:27.592 --> 30:29.230
Cut the audio. Cue music.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.771
Can you smell it?
It's just like sweetness.

30:34.065 --> 30:35.408
Naughty boy.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.308
Get him out of there, please.

30:46.277 --> 30:52.228
And we are out
in three, two, one.

30:53.418 --> 30:57.867
Brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant show.

30:57.922 --> 31:01.699
You were marvelous.
And you were marvelous.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.851
THE EXECUTIONER: Hey!

31:15.907 --> 31:17.818
Stop right there!

31:19.010 --> 31:21.286
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

31:21.346 --> 31:24.054
He's an embarrassment.
I should have cut him
In half there and then.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.617
No, no, no, no!

31:25.683 --> 31:28.425
You are not going
to kill him!

31:28.486 --> 31:29.692
Yes, I am.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.132
Kaden, be reasonable.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.305
Reasonable?
This cunt deserves to die.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.501
Yes he does,
but not this way.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.572
It's wasted
if he dies off camera.

31:41.633 --> 31:42.668
Fuck the cameras!

31:42.967 --> 31:44.742
Kaden, where's your
sense of adventure?

31:46.271 --> 31:47.409
He wronged me.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.918
He wronged us!

31:49.974 --> 31:53.922
Look, I want to hold his head
on the chopping block for you.

31:53.978 --> 31:55.889
But we can break him.
We can make him fight.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.853
We can make him
fight for us.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.525
On our stage.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.190
And if he won't?

32:04.289 --> 32:08.032
Then you get your wish.
Fuck the cameras.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.108
(YELLING)

32:23.608 --> 32:24.985
(WHISTLING)

32:33.685 --> 32:36.029
TAIGA: So, there we were.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.033
Akiko got a headache
from the flight,

32:38.089 --> 32:40.933
so she went out
to get some Aspirin.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.970
That was the last time
I ever saw her.

32:52.337 --> 32:53.873
Searched the city for days.

32:55.239 --> 32:59.244
Contacted the authorities,
the embassy. Nothing.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.052
There was no trace of her.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.617
And then I got
a phone call.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.158
It was the first time
I ever heard that voice.

33:11.389 --> 33:12.561
And she said

33:13.658 --> 33:17.538
If I ever wanted
to see my wife alive,

33:17.595 --> 33:20.269
I should do
exactly what she says.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.571
It's so fucking cliché!

33:25.770 --> 33:27.579
I should have known
something was up

33:27.638 --> 33:29.379
when she never
asked for a ransom.

33:31.709 --> 33:35.521
She told me
to go to this bar
outside the city.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.692
To go alone.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.662
But when I got there,

33:42.987 --> 33:44.660
there was no Akiko.

33:45.690 --> 33:46.964
Only that woman.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.968
She's the same woman
that brought you.

33:52.663 --> 33:54.404
Then I woke up here.

33:54.465 --> 33:56.138
How long has it been?

33:58.269 --> 34:00.271
A month.
Six weeks maybe.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.978
When you never see
the sun rise or set,
how do you know?

34:06.344 --> 34:08.290
Why'd they choose you?

34:09.981 --> 34:12.393
Because I trained
with weapons all my life.

34:13.885 --> 34:14.920
Have you fought?

34:16.454 --> 34:17.524
Yeah.

34:19.023 --> 34:20.092
It was either him or me.

34:22.427 --> 34:23.963
We're all already
dead anyway.

34:24.027 --> 34:25.132
(SHUSHES)

34:25.797 --> 34:27.242
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

34:30.902 --> 34:33.041
I brought you '
something to eat.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.379
Why?

34:37.375 --> 34:38.752
It's simple.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.430
Satisfied?

35:06.938 --> 35:09.441
You were lucky.
You won't be next time.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.943
Why do you care?

35:12.810 --> 35:13.982
I can help you.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.285
I don't need your help.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.326
Without me,
you'd be dead very soon.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.358
What's in it for you, huh?

35:19.484 --> 35:21.088
I recruited you.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.200
You win, I win.

36:14.539 --> 36:15.745
(BUZZING)

36:37.695 --> 36:39.504
I know it must be
maddening for you,

36:39.564 --> 36:41.339
but your situation
is hopeless.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.043
Can't escape.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.841
You can only hope to survive.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.476
Who the hell are you?

36:48.539 --> 36:51.850
I am that man
behind the curtain.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.986
You're sick.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.325
When I was growing up,
my father used to
stage these brutal,

36:59.383 --> 37:01.624
bare-knuckle
fights in the backyard.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.632
All these assholes
would come over
and drink and gamble

37:04.689 --> 37:06.965
and cheer the winners
and spit on the losers.

37:07.758 --> 37:10.432
Well, in my mind,

37:10.494 --> 37:13.498
just watching
those poor fools lose
wasn't enough.

37:14.031 --> 37:17.604
So I've upped the ante,
as it were.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.309
I'm gonna kill you.
You know that?

37:23.574 --> 37:26.282
What we have here

37:26.344 --> 37:28.790
is a failure
to communicate.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.055
(LAUGHING)

37:33.751 --> 37:37.062
I have always
wanted to say that!

37:38.456 --> 37:40.697
I love Strother Martin.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.605
Oh. Where were we?

37:47.798 --> 37:49.573
Ah, yes.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.407
The paradox.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.850
You won't fight,

37:54.905 --> 37:56.612
but you don't want to die.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.684
But you will die,

38:00.044 --> 38:01.751
if you won't fight.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.850
You see our dilemma?

38:05.349 --> 38:08.228
I won't fight.
Not for you.

38:08.419 --> 38:11.195
Well, who would you
fight for? Your wife?

38:11.922 --> 38:14.835
Oh, that's right.
She's dead.

38:16.193 --> 38:19.231
Well, what would you
fight for?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.642
Your freedom?

38:24.535 --> 38:27.948
No, no, seriously.
I'll make you a proposition.

38:29.540 --> 38:33.511
You give me,
say, 10 fights.

38:33.744 --> 38:34.882
One down, nine to go.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.150
I didn't kill that man.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.750
Horribly mutilated
and left for dead?

38:38.816 --> 38:42.093
Knowing he was
going to be killed, huh?
Shades of gray, David.

38:42.186 --> 38:43.824
Shades of gray.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.666
You give me '
an all-out effort,

38:46.724 --> 38:49.261
nine more times and win,

38:50.061 --> 38:51.199
and I'll let you go.

38:52.129 --> 38:53.130
(SCOFFS)

38:54.565 --> 38:57.307
I'm witness
to kidnapping,
torture and murder.

38:57.368 --> 38:58.870
I know your faces.

38:58.969 --> 39:01.711
You really want me
to believe
you'll just let me go?

39:02.773 --> 39:04.377
Well, you'll be
drugged and dropped

39:04.442 --> 39:06.854
on some desolate road
in a Third World country,

39:06.911 --> 39:09.323
yeah, but you'll be free.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.282
(LAUGHS)

39:11.349 --> 39:14.091
And as far as you
knowing who we are,

39:15.686 --> 39:17.290
you don't know shit.

39:17.355 --> 39:23.203
Look, the FBI, MI5, Interpol,
all kinds of motherfuckers
are looking for us.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.965
I don't fear
a fireman from Denver.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.278
I give you my word.

39:31.602 --> 39:35.140
Give me nine
more fights and win,

39:35.206 --> 39:38.050
and, in the words
of Abraham Lincoln,

39:38.109 --> 39:40.146
"I'll set you free!"

39:42.146 --> 39:45.650
Fuck you! I'll die
before I kill for you.

39:46.951 --> 39:51.730
Oh, I am sorely disappointed.
Crushed, really.

39:53.290 --> 39:55.167
But I haven't
lost my appetite.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.094
(LAUGHS)

40:08.105 --> 40:09.516
(SHARPENING KNIFE)

40:18.082 --> 40:19.527
What is your name?

40:21.385 --> 40:23.558
You expecting
a different answer?

40:32.329 --> 40:33.831
Oh, Death Dealer.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.270
How lovely it would be.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.013
But first,

40:40.805 --> 40:42.682
you must fight for me.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.420
Or what?

40:45.943 --> 40:47.752
You gonna kill me?

40:47.812 --> 40:50.486
No. I'm gonna kill

40:51.549 --> 40:52.926
her.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.755
Your friend's wife. Akiko.

40:59.089 --> 41:00.693
You have three minutes

41:01.492 --> 41:03.904
to kill your opponent.

41:04.428 --> 41:07.307
And by kill, I mean...

41:08.966 --> 41:10.912
Off with his head.

41:12.002 --> 41:15.506
You do that in
the allotted amount of time,

41:17.875 --> 41:19.821
she goes free.

41:20.845 --> 41:23.451
But you lose,

41:24.114 --> 41:29.086
or you're one second
over three minutes,

41:31.922 --> 41:33.833
I will slice her throat,

41:34.458 --> 41:37.496
and bleed her like
a little fucking piggy.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.469
(CHUCKLES)

41:40.631 --> 41:43.168
You know, they say

41:44.068 --> 41:47.572
you drown in your own blood.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.919
Sounds like
a horrible way to go.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.190
I'll take it that
you accept my offer.

42:26.243 --> 42:27.244
(EXCLAIMING)

42:27.578 --> 42:28.989
Hey, dude, come here.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.521
You're retarded.
Come on. Line up's up.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.619
CRAIG: "White Samurai"?

42:34.752 --> 42:35.787
Yeah.

42:35.853 --> 42:37.696
He's only fought once.
He's kind of a pussy.

42:37.755 --> 42:38.961
You're kind of a pussy.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.866
I like the Dealer of Death.
JOSH: Death Dealer.

42:40.925 --> 42:42.427
Whatever.
No, not whatever.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.370
His name is Death Dealer,
that's what
you should call him.

42:44.428 --> 42:45.839
Shut up, okay?

42:45.896 --> 42:47.273
(MUTTERS)

42:49.199 --> 42:51.770
SAMANTHA: Oh, my gosh,
a damsel in distress.

42:52.703 --> 42:53.773
Classic.

42:53.837 --> 42:54.872
I love samurais.

42:54.939 --> 42:55.974
Who doesn't?

42:56.473 --> 42:57.543
LOGAN: Bring up the music.

42:58.375 --> 43:02.016
Gently. Gently.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.056
Now give me a breeze.

43:06.984 --> 43:08.361
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

43:29.206 --> 43:31.743
Ah. Lovely!

43:32.109 --> 43:33.383
Ninjas don't like samurais.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.981
That's not true.
Ninjas and samurais
are like cousins.

43:36.947 --> 43:37.948
(YELLING)

44:14.685 --> 44:16.062
Oh! Yeah.
Yeah!

44:16.120 --> 44:17.190
That is disgusting.

44:17.254 --> 44:18.289
I love it when
they get gruesome.

44:39.576 --> 44:40.577
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

44:40.644 --> 44:42.282
Do you think
he's gonna make it?
Yeah.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.620
No, he's done. He's done.
No, he's hurt.

44:56.593 --> 44:57.901
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

44:57.961 --> 44:59.872
What?
Awesome!

45:07.971 --> 45:09.075
(SCREAMING)

45:09.139 --> 45:10.243
David.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.478
Taiga. Taiga.

45:11.775 --> 45:15.018
Taiga, no, no, no.

45:16.914 --> 45:19.019
They told me
they would kill her.

45:19.917 --> 45:21.487
I'm sorry.

45:22.853 --> 45:24.526
JOSH: Safe.
That was insane.

45:25.355 --> 45:26.834
I'm sorry.

45:28.358 --> 45:31.362
THE EXECUTIONER:
The White Samurai
fought with bravery.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.136
But was unable to
defeat his opponent.

45:35.399 --> 45:39.279
And unable to
save his princess.

46:01.024 --> 46:02.503
That was a little gross.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.041
I'm sorry.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.084
There's nothing I can do.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.761
THE EXECUTIONER:
Why are you letting
this man suffer?

46:26.817 --> 46:28.888
End it. Kill him.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.627
Kill him now.

46:42.966 --> 46:43.967
(YELLING)

46:46.270 --> 46:47.681
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

46:49.273 --> 46:50.775
Awesome!

47:02.953 --> 47:03.988
Fade music.

47:06.290 --> 47:07.735
Fade graphics.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.329
And we're

47:12.529 --> 47:13.530
out.

47:14.398 --> 47:15.570
(LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY)

47:16.066 --> 47:19.240
That was astounding!

47:20.237 --> 47:22.717
Kudos to us all.

47:23.507 --> 47:27.922
You said he would
fight, Milla,
and fight he did.

47:29.112 --> 47:30.648
My money, please.

47:34.852 --> 47:39.460
Ladies, will you please
wire Milla's winnings.

47:44.428 --> 47:45.930
Kawaii.

47:54.838 --> 47:57.114
A little something extra.

47:57.975 --> 47:59.784
You've done
exceedingly well, Milla.

48:00.577 --> 48:04.047
Your fireman from Denver
may turn out
to be a rainmaker.

48:06.750 --> 48:08.024
DAVID: Hey

48:09.319 --> 48:10.559
You.

48:11.822 --> 48:13.631
The one behind the curtain.

48:15.092 --> 48:16.435
Yes.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.297
I accept your offer.

48:19.096 --> 48:22.839
I will give my absolute best
for another eight fights.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.472
On one condition.

48:26.536 --> 48:28.174
And that is?

48:28.839 --> 48:30.682
The last fight,

48:32.676 --> 48:33.916
I want him.

48:34.544 --> 48:35.545
(LAUGHS)

48:36.747 --> 48:38.226
Those are my terms.

48:39.283 --> 48:41.024
You don't like them,

48:41.852 --> 48:43.229
then we're done with
this bullshit right now.

48:50.761 --> 48:54.766
You are not going
to kill yourself.
You're bluffing.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.577
You don't think
I could beat him.

48:59.202 --> 49:01.773
Please, it's a nonissue.

49:01.838 --> 49:06.150
No one's ever survived
five contests, let alone 10.

49:09.479 --> 49:11.288
People want
to see me fight.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.451
I want to fight.

49:15.085 --> 49:16.120
Well?

49:16.887 --> 49:18.525
What's it gonna be?

49:20.958 --> 49:22.995
That's up to you, Kaden.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.770
And what if he wins?

49:26.763 --> 49:30.336
You know I'd never
allow that to happen.

49:33.036 --> 49:35.107
We accept your offer,

49:35.572 --> 49:37.347
Death Dealer.

49:44.047 --> 49:45.355
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

49:50.320 --> 49:51.321
(SCREAMS)

50:03.433 --> 50:05.071
They're moving you
into another room.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.774
I'd rather have antibiotics.

50:09.406 --> 50:11.283
I can get you those.

50:11.341 --> 50:12.945
What changed?

50:15.278 --> 50:17.189
You fought.

50:17.247 --> 50:18.851
You mean, I won.

50:20.717 --> 50:24.324
So what?
Now I'm your prize pig?

50:26.456 --> 50:28.197
How much is your cut

50:28.792 --> 50:31.966
of the death of
another innocent life, huh?

50:33.630 --> 50:35.371
Do you want
the antibiotics or not?

50:36.299 --> 50:38.506
Yeah, I want the antibiotics.

50:42.105 --> 50:44.449
And something to sew it up!

50:45.809 --> 50:47.117
(GROANING)

51:17.340 --> 51:19.377
DAVID: Watch the muscle,
watch the muscle.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.620
Right there.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.158
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

51:34.091 --> 51:35.434
Wider stitches, okay?

51:36.593 --> 51:39.267
Very good.
Pull the skin.

51:39.429 --> 51:42.467
Pull the skin.
Pull it tight.

51:54.211 --> 51:55.588
(GROANING)

52:08.925 --> 52:10.529
Fuck.

52:17.434 --> 52:18.845
Yeah, yeah.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.808
Looks like
you're getting better.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.738
Better enough to fight.

52:54.738 --> 52:56.183
Exactly.

53:08.084 --> 53:09.154
Thank you.

53:12.255 --> 53:13.563
Really.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.855
(GRUNTING)

55:01.131 --> 55:02.371
(YELLING)

55:24.988 --> 55:27.901
Yeah, we sure do
like a whipping.

55:27.957 --> 55:28.958
But nothing

55:30.193 --> 55:31.934
like a pussy-whipping.

55:32.429 --> 55:33.430
(DOOR OPENING)

55:56.486 --> 55:57.726

57:55.572 --> 57:57.279
Hey, check this out.

57:57.340 --> 57:58.978
What's up?

57:59.042 --> 58:00.112
Oh, dude.

58:00.176 --> 58:01.211
Yeah.

58:01.277 --> 58:03.780
Hell, yeah,
Death Dealer
will be all over him.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.587
You think so?
Definitely.

58:05.648 --> 58:06.683
He's gonna kill him.

58:06.749 --> 58:07.819
The Executioner's
big guy.

59:08.011 --> 59:09.820
What'd you do
to your hair?

59:10.947 --> 59:14.258
Just trying something
a little different.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.477
(YELLING)

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.612
I am David Lord.

LOGAN: (WHOOPING)
Yeah! Yeah!

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.657
Oh, my goodness!

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:36.227
He is every bit as good
as you were in your prime.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.665
You know, just
say the word, partner.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.438
We can call this off.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.399
(GRUNTING)

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.674
(CHUCKLING)

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:41.095
My name is David Lord.
And in one more fight,
I'm gonna kill you.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.433
(YELLING)

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.611
That was amazing, my man.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:58.718
Bravo! Bravo!

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.055
Better watch your back.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.258
He may have
found himself
a new favorite.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.639
We've got a situation up here.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.279
(EXPLODING)

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:41.920
Brutus Jackson,
who terrorized
South Africa 12 months ago

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.651
by going on
a drug-induced rampage,

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:46.623
killing 14 people,
has escaped.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:50.759
Jackson was being transferred
to the death row
facility at Pollsmoor

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.926
when the transport
carrying him was
brazenly ambushed

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.299
just outside
the Robben Island Prison gate.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:05:00.897
The three guards
escorting Jackson
were found dead at the scene.

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:03.409
Local authorities
have no further
information at this time.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:11.344
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:10.172
I don't see
the problem.

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:14.515
The whole universe
is looking for us

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.851
and you pull
a stunt like this!

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.654
You kidnap
a world-famous
serial killer?

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:19.918
Spree killer.

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:23.157
You might as well
drop a trail of bread crumbs

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.926
leading law enforcement
to our door!

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:28.491
Come on.
The deadbeats
are boring.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:30.036
All the mind fucking
in the world

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.537
can't help someone
who's physically weak.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.266
Listen, and this guy,

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:37.834
he is a monster.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.808
He is ready
to kill again.

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:45.085
Think of the added revenue
when our audience
sees that it's him.

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:49.684
No longer will
anyone be able to claim
that our fights aren't real.

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:54.025
You're afraid of him.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:06:00.299
Yeah, and you will be, too,
once you get up
close and personal.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:03.030
No, no, no, no.
Not the serial killer.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.266
You're afraid of
the fireman.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.140
(CHOKES)

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:13.312
You are hurting me!

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.640
(COUGHING)

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.160
What?

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:36.134
How did you come
to be their hostage?

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.229
That's funny.

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:43.510
Let's just say
my family wasn't as
pleasant as they are.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.307
Certainly with less reward.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:55.146
Kaden's afraid of you.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.458
He brought in
some professional,

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.787
some maniac
from South Africa.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.237
Come back alive. Please.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.678
Just two more
and at least one
of us will be free.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.385
You know they
won't let me live.

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:33.321
I have a brother, Sam.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.364
We haven't spoken
since the accident.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.464
I tuned out
everyone I ever loved.

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:45.369
He probably doesn't
even know I'm missing.

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.965
Or that I'll soon be dead.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.567
Wish I had been
a better brother.

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:55.708
Now I want closure,
you know?

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.287
So have you guys
done that whole,
you know,

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.162
college threesome
thing yet or...
Dude.

01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.395
You're never gonna
believe who
Death Dealer is fighting.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.537
Remember that
South African
serial killer guy?

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.731
Yeah.
The one who escaped?

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.466
Yeah.
Yeah. Him.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:55.131
Tonight?
Now.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.370
It was nice meeting you guys.
Have fun.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.176
ALL: (CHANTING)
Death Dealer! Death Dealer!

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.514
Oh, my God.
Sacagawea!

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.254
Kill the man!
Yeah!

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.234
God damn!

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.600
Where'd he go?

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.874
Kaneko, Kawaii,
can one of you find him?

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:41.183
Having a little
bit of fun now,
aren't we? Yeah?

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.919
Well, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.223
(YELLING)

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.703
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Yes! All day long, yeah!

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:57.897
God, this is so awesome!

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:05.036
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:11.674
Got a lot of fight in ya.

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:15.715
It's pointless,
