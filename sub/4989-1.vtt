(screams and sirens)

02:59.388 --> 03:01.682
Oh, damn it.

03:01.723 --> 03:06.728
This thing is not designed
for a human to pour coffee with.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.105
Go sit down, I'll bring
your breakfast.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.899
- It's a gag coffeepot.
- It's okay.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.862
Here you go, sweetie.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.866
I was reading about
this new sex scandal.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.081
So, last night was okay?
It wasn't too quick?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.916
- It was nice.
- Are you sure?

03:27.958 --> 03:32.171
- I've got so much on my mind...
- It was nice. It always is.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.339
- It always is?
- Um-hmm.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.343
It always is?

03:38.385 --> 03:40.095
You want some melon?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.723
You're totally satisfied
with our sex life?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.433
Yeah, I'm totally satisfied, honey.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.602
I'll get you some melon.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.313
And there's nothing
you would do different?

03:49.354 --> 03:52.065
No changes you would make?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.485
Different?

03:55.527 --> 03:59.114
Yeah...
nothing you wanna try?

03:59.156 --> 04:02.659
Try the melon...
it's so good.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.162
Nothing...

04:05.162 --> 04:07.456
you've always been
curious about...?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.459
No, I'm just
completely happy.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.544
You are?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.255
Try the melon,
it's so good.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.473
(Radio:)
Have you ever practiced lesbianism?

04:24.515 --> 04:27.351
- No.
- Other women don't excite you?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.853
- No.
- Have these ladies come on to you?

04:29.895 --> 04:33.357
Umm... if so, I didn't notice it.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.859
Are you having lunch
with me today?

04:35.859 --> 04:39.738
No, sorry, Didi,
Marty's taking me to lunch.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.201
That's okay, I understand.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.620
If he cancels, though,
I'm still available.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.830
Your husband's taking you to lunch?
That's sweet.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.958
Yeah, he is sweet.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.668
(doorbell rings)

04:55.087 --> 04:56.672
Hey, beautiful.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.756
Hey...

04:58.674 --> 05:00.342
- You hungry?
- Ooh, I'm starved.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.678
- Can we go someplace nice?
- Anywhere you want.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.309
Darn, you showed.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.312
If you didn't show,
I was gonna take her to lunch.

05:12.354 --> 05:16.024
Sorry to disappoint you, Didi,
but I showed.

05:16.066 --> 05:20.362
Yes, you did, I'm not
gonna hold it against you, though.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.865
Have a nice lunch
with your sexy-ass wife.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.491
- I will.
- You ready?

05:24.533 --> 05:25.951
Definitely.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.246
What, you're mad? Don't be mad,
it's a nice restaurant.

05:29.288 --> 05:33.834
Come on, I don't have time
I'm behind the eight-ball at work.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.878
I made that doctor's appointment
for you today.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.212
Don't forget it, okay?

05:37.254 --> 05:40.841
I cannot believe I gotta
let 'em put a camera in my ass.

05:40.883 --> 05:44.720
You're at the age where
you gotta take care of yourself.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.263
They called the office.
Know what they wanna know?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.432
Do I wanna pay extra
to use the Sony?

05:48.473 --> 05:51.560
They got a Sony product
that goes up my ass.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.979
"Sony Assman".

05:55.606 --> 05:59.568
So what's the deal
with little Didi at work?

05:59.610 --> 06:01.445
Any new lesbian stories?

06:01.486 --> 06:05.073
I don't think she's a lesbian.
She might be bisexual.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.202
That's better still.
We like bisexual.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.871
- We do?
- Yes, we do.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.956
Is she openly bisexual?

06:12.998 --> 06:15.375
What do you mean
by "openly bisexual"?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.586
I mean, is she openly bisexual?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.546
If I went right now to the salon,
and opened the front door,

06:19.588 --> 06:23.091
I walked in and yelled,
"Hey, anybody here bisexual?",

06:23.133 --> 06:24.760
what would little Didi do?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.262
Do we have to talk about Didi's
sexuality all the time?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.597
Yes...

06:28.639 --> 06:31.808
You're totally obsessed by this
every time you see her.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.312
She's hot for you, Laura.
It's the start of the new millenium,

06:35.354 --> 06:37.564
everyone's doin' it.
Don't be so straight.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.441
I am straight.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.319
I think it'd be good for ya.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.238
- Is that what you think?
- I do...

06:44.279 --> 06:47.199
I think it'd be good for us.
Menage a trois,

06:47.241 --> 06:49.701
inside the confines
of a good marriage.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.245
What happens if I like it?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.872
If you like it? Great.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.417
What if you come home
and we are going at it in our bedroom?

06:57.459 --> 06:59.294
Wouldn't you be just a little hurt?

06:59.336 --> 07:03.006
Hurt? Only if I smash my face
on the headboard...

07:03.048 --> 07:05.300
diving under the blankets
with the two of you...

07:05.342 --> 07:08.345
I'd be thrilled you found
a new hobby you liked.

07:11.807 --> 07:16.019
See how clear that picture is?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.063
The same way you're looking
around the office,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.691
I'm looking at the lower intestines,

07:20.732 --> 07:22.693
and then this curves it around...

07:24.444 --> 07:27.197
And this is actually a job
you wanted as a kid?

07:29.032 --> 07:32.536
That's funny.
Lie down there.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.788
We'll see who's laughing
in about a minute.

07:34.872 --> 07:38.167
Knees forward, if you would, please.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.085
Be gentle.
I know this comes as a shock,

07:40.127 --> 07:42.546
but I'm not real excited about this.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.549
No... that makes two of us.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.553
Oh-oh-oh!
Wait, wait...

07:49.595 --> 07:50.846
Ow, ow!

07:50.888 --> 07:53.765
Pull it out, Jerry!
Pull it out!

07:53.807 --> 07:56.768
Hey, four-year-old,
it's just the lubricant.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.439
I haven't started
with the probe yet.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.609
Gentle is the buzzword
for today, okay?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.070
Ohh!

08:17.706 --> 08:21.877
Have you seen that new
Porsche Boxter?

08:25.923 --> 08:28.217
It's a beauty.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.886
Ohh-hh!!

08:34.972 --> 08:37.100
(doorbell rings)

08:37.142 --> 08:39.520
Hey... Jane!

08:39.561 --> 08:41.313
- Hi!
- How're you doin'?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.940
I didn't know you were in town.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.026
I'm going to San Francisco.
I was gonna visit on my way back,

08:46.068 --> 08:48.070
but I decided to visit
on my way up.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.113
- Didn't Laura tell you?
- No, she didn't.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.282
But that's okay.
You're always welcome, you know that.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.245
What?

08:57.496 --> 09:01.208
I just miss you.
It's great to see my best friend.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.085
I miss you too.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.097
- I love this.
- I just got it.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.266
That is so not me.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.559
No.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.687
So how are your sculptures doing?

09:21.728 --> 09:26.400
They're doing great.
I think a gallery wants to show them.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.611
I love this one.
Is this new?

09:29.653 --> 09:31.697
It really works on the piano.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.325
Isn't it great, Marty?

09:35.367 --> 09:38.704
$18,000 in lessons,
and tchotchkes for the living room,

09:38.745 --> 09:42.833
I couldn't be more happy.
Are you kiddin' me, Jane?

09:42.875 --> 09:45.669
I don't want her having hobbies,

09:45.711 --> 09:48.881
- I want it to be all about me.
- About you, huh?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.049
You should be making
little sculptures of me.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.554
Feels so good.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.598
It's so good to see you.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.894
Wow, look at this,
erotic feet massaging.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.480
This is great.
Good and gay, I love this.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.025
- It is not gay.
- What?

10:08.025 --> 10:09.651
Can you imagine me
and one of my buddies...

10:09.693 --> 10:13.238
sitting on this couch,
rubbing each other's feet?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.199
Not a pretty sight, is it?

10:15.199 --> 10:17.868
Women can get away with this,
and it's a beautiful thing.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.828
It's not gay, Marty.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.998
It's gay, and I love it.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.960
I'm not into women, but if I was,
this would be my first stop,

10:27.002 --> 10:30.172
and you, my dear,
would be in serious trouble.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.341
That's it. I'm going upstairs
to write to "Penthouse".

10:33.425 --> 10:34.718
Is he serious?

10:34.760 --> 10:38.222
He would love it if I would
sleep with him and a woman.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.349
Apparently, it's all he
and his buddies ever talk about.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.518
What is it with these guys
and that stupid fantasy?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.020
They can't please one woman,
let alone two.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.147
Maybe that's what
the second woman is for...

10:47.189 --> 10:49.816
to do half the work.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.987
Diva, did the mail come?

10:54.029 --> 10:55.822
Mmm - yes.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.284
And I'm sorry, but they're all bills.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
Well, I can handle them, okay?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.373
Once Billy finishes this house...

11:04.414 --> 11:07.668
those lots are gonna sell like crazy.
I'm not worried.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.046
Nothing fazes you, Marty.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.007
I'll tell you what fazes me...

11:14.049 --> 11:16.844
- You marrying that ski bum...
- I'll bet.

11:17.219 --> 11:20.681
It does... I'm concerned,
can't you tell?

11:20.764 --> 11:23.058
How's he gonna support you,
this guy?

11:23.100 --> 11:26.061
What's the pay scale
for the ski patrol?

11:26.103 --> 11:27.896
Guy's got no future, Diva.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.107
Oh, he's got a future, stop it.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.945
The ski patrol? What's he gonna
make one day, sergeant?

11:36.446 --> 11:39.408
Best case scenario,
you're married to a mountie.

11:40.659 --> 11:45.038
I got a great idea for an investor.
Dave Pembroke.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.041
Dave Pembroke?

11:48.083 --> 11:50.460
From Michigan, Dave Pembroke?
I remember him...

11:50.460 --> 11:53.755
he was a real tough guy,
beating everybody's ass.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.800
He was in my brother's grade,
that whole crowd of guys...

11:56.842 --> 11:58.802
who got their jollies
beating people up.

11:58.802 --> 12:04.141
Well, now he's getting some jollies
outta $30 million.

12:04.183 --> 12:08.437
Guy's got 18 furniture stores
down in Orange County.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.689
Hey, Clay.
You got my note?

12:10.731 --> 12:16.528
I've invited him
Sunday for brunch.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.780
Sunday's not good for me.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.783
Why? What's Sunday?

12:21.825 --> 12:26.205
You got that girl coming in?
From Fresno?

12:26.246 --> 12:29.082
You know what, Bill?
You're married, you got two kids...

12:29.124 --> 12:31.835
Would you relax?
I'm having fun.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.754
Having fun?
You're gonna get caught.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.506
- I'm not gonna get caught.
- You're cheating on your wife...

12:35.547 --> 12:38.592
you're gonna get caught.
Listen to me...

12:38.634 --> 12:43.222
You're in a situation
you can't control.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.807
And somewhere along the way,
someone, some idiot...

12:45.849 --> 12:48.352
is gonna say the wrong thing
at the wrong time,

12:48.352 --> 12:50.646
- and it's gonna get back to Carol.
- Would you relax?

12:50.687 --> 12:56.276
- Nobody knows, Marty.
- I'll tell you who knows...

12:56.318 --> 12:59.988
This is gonna sound corny,
and you'll tease me later,

13:00.030 --> 13:04.993
but I'll tell ya who knows.
God knows.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.038
God does not know.
And if he does know...

13:08.038 --> 13:10.541
- he doesn't care.
- He does care, okay?

13:10.541 --> 13:12.584
Cheating on your wife
is not cool.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.546
I know - I'm gonna get struck down
by a bolt of lightning...

13:15.587 --> 13:18.674
- is that what you're telling me?
- Exactly...

13:18.715 --> 13:22.261
that's what I'm saying,
and I stand real close to you,

13:22.302 --> 13:25.013
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd get your shit together.

13:25.055 --> 13:31.270
Don't you judge me.
Have you seen my wife lately?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.021
- She's fat.
- She's not fat...

13:33.063 --> 13:35.190
She's fat. She's not
into sex anymore...

13:35.232 --> 13:38.652
all she wants to do is eat.
I'm a man. I got my needs.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.280
I have my needs, too.
At the top of my needs list,

13:41.321 --> 13:46.034
is you to be at my house
for brunch on Sunday.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.663
Marty's on my case about going
to this brunch at his house.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.708
- Brunch?
- He's making a big deal about it.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.501
That's a Jew thing, brunch.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.295
They can't decide if they want
breakfast or lunch,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.046
so they have both.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.299
I can't wait
till he hears the gossip.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.509
He's gonna love it.
He's got a thing for her.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.970
- He's got a thing for Diva?
- He would never admit it...

14:05.012 --> 14:07.139
but he's dying to just take her.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.057
So why doesn't he just do it?

14:09.099 --> 14:12.019
For one reason, she's engaged.
And also because...

14:12.060 --> 14:14.313
he's very hung up
about not screwing around.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.357
The guy's very straight that way.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.234
I don't get that.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.236
European men, they've been
doing it for centuries.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.447
Doesn't make 'em assholes.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.657
Guy in America, gets a little
action on the side,

14:25.699 --> 14:29.036
they label him an asshole.
I do not get that.

14:29.077 --> 14:33.373
And I blame the Pilgrim men.
In the beginning of our society,

14:33.415 --> 14:37.169
they got all religious and puritanical.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.755
They fucked the whole thing up.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.591
They gave away deal points
they had no business giving away.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.426
Where did you hear that?

14:44.468 --> 14:48.138
I should have negotiated that deal.
We'd all be gettin' laid.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.682
- Gentlewomen, what's up?
- How are you?

14:50.724 --> 14:54.478
I'm good. Take care of your
little scheduling problem?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.480
- See?
- Jew.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.106
I'm not going to brunch
with Dave Pembroke.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.442
The guy's Republican.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.862
Big deal, so am I
when I'm looking for an investor.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.864
Wait till you hear the good gossip.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.909
The good gossip? Coming from you,
Murphy, it's bullshit.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.995
It's about your assistant... Diva.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.082
What about Diva?

15:15.123 --> 15:17.125
The guy that sold car phones
to Eric Keldren's company?

15:17.167 --> 15:19.795
Went to college with her.
He was in her dorm.

15:19.837 --> 15:22.923
Said she spent a fair amount
of time on the front line...

15:22.965 --> 15:25.133
saw a lot of action.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.802
So what? What is it?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.513
Guess.

15:29.555 --> 15:30.889
She did a two-way.

15:30.931 --> 15:34.268
- Better...
- She did a gang-bang.

15:34.309 --> 15:38.021
It's coming from Eric. I don't believe
a word out of his mouth.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.648
Girls.

15:41.233 --> 15:45.988
- She did girls.
- She did girls?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.823
This is true?

15:47.865 --> 15:51.076
Diva did girls in college?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.620
(Laura:)
You believe that story is true?

15:53.662 --> 15:57.124
I believe it.
Keldren's a lot of things,

15:57.207 --> 15:59.084
but the guy's not a liar.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.712
She's young.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.714
Young girls...

16:03.714 --> 16:06.341
they're all into it nowadays.
It's become very fashionable.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.968
Yeah? Well, for me, it hasn't.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.012
Will you cut it out
with the cookies? Cholesterol.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.847
One cookie.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.059
Will you look at this?
Lucia's getting so lazy.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.020
She put the bowl away
without drying it.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.191
You know what I'm thinkin'?
It would be good for you.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.985
- Like a life lesson.
- For me?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.362
Yeah... open you up a little bit.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.449
I think it would be fun.

16:30.490 --> 16:35.204
I'm sure it would be fun for you.
You'd be having a lot of fun.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.585
You're always saying you wanna
do things for the marriage.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.171
Always talking about hobbies
and projects and shit,

16:44.213 --> 16:49.510
that's what this would be.
It would be like a bonding thing.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.512
How stupid do I look to you?

16:51.553 --> 16:54.515
All right, so I took a shot.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.934
How much longer before dinner?
I'm starved.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.230
Looks like you've already
eaten dinner.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.733
I've been married to my husband
for 30 years.

17:04.775 --> 17:09.404
- Wow, that's great.
- It's a miracle...

17:09.445 --> 17:13.867
that in the last 30 years,
I didn't kill him in his sleep.

17:13.909 --> 17:17.079
Jump on a plane,
and not come back.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.957
- How long have you been married?
- Six years.

17:19.998 --> 17:23.460
That's nice.
Gonna have kids?

17:23.502 --> 17:26.213
Yeah, I think we will.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.590
Have all the fun you can
while you can.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.926
Do it now,
get it out of the way.

17:30.968 --> 17:35.848
The spending and traveling
and the nuttiness. Just do it all.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.267
Do it all before the kids come.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.395
After the kids come,
there's no more fun.

17:41.436 --> 17:45.983
- Come on, you love your kids, right?
- Not today.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.318
I don't love anybody today.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.822
Except you.
I love my hairdresser.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.074
Oh - oh - oh...!

18:05.878 --> 18:09.173
- Was that okay?
- Yeah, it was. Oh yeah.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.716
Good.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.178
Still is to me,
I gotta tell you, Laura...

18:14.219 --> 18:16.597
I look down and wonder
how I got into bed

18:16.638 --> 18:19.600
with a woman
as good looking as you.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.268
I do.
After all this time,

18:21.310 --> 18:26.815
I still think you're going
to look at me and yell for a cop.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.483
Oh, Marty... shut up.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.284
See what I'm saying? We have sex,
what's the first thing you do?

18:37.326 --> 18:40.120
You get up and wash up.
How does that work?

18:42.706 --> 18:45.042
So that's what
you really want, huh?

18:45.083 --> 18:47.836
For me to have sex
with you and another woman?

18:47.878 --> 18:51.048
Yeah...

18:51.089 --> 18:54.051
Oh, yeah.
I'd like it a lot.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.763
And you want me to kiss her,
and... you know...

18:57.804 --> 18:59.348
go down on her?

18:59.389 --> 19:03.810
Yeah... I mean,
if you wanted to go down on her.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.355
I don't know.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.106
- I don't know if I could.
- What...?

19:08.148 --> 19:10.192
I do it all the time,
it's not so bad.

19:10.234 --> 19:13.862
Plus, you have...
the home court advantage.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.031
- What's that?
- Home court advantage...

19:16.073 --> 19:17.866
that's what you have.
Think about it.

19:17.908 --> 19:20.661
You're a woman,
you know what's going on down there.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.622
You could do it better
than me your first time out...

19:23.664 --> 19:27.584
on my best night ever.
Which was...

19:27.584 --> 19:31.255
last April, at the cabin.
Rememeber?

19:31.296 --> 19:34.716
You could be better than that.
Better than last me April.

19:34.758 --> 19:38.053
- I could?
- You could, first time out, because...

19:38.095 --> 19:40.389
you have the home court advantage.
That's my theory...

19:40.430 --> 19:45.102
on why women are getting
into other women.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.813
- Yeah? What's that theory?
- Human nature.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.731
Everybody likes to do something
that they're good at...

19:49.773 --> 19:53.277
everyone likes to excel.
Women are finding something

19:53.318 --> 19:56.655
that they're really good at,
really easily, really fast.

19:56.697 --> 20:00.159
And they're really enjoying it.
And it's home court advantage.

20:00.200 --> 20:06.665
I think you would be somebody
that would benefit from it.

20:06.707 --> 20:10.127
(gargling)

20:11.545 --> 20:14.089
I couldn't do it with a stranger.
I want you to know that.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.300
All right, fine.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.469
And I'm not gonna do it
with Diva, all right?

20:19.511 --> 20:22.264
- Diva?
- You do not get to screw Diva.

20:22.306 --> 20:25.642
Fine. Diva's off the list.
Forget Diva.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.020
I love the fact
we're having this conversation.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.732
- I bet you do.
- What about Didi at your salon?

20:31.773 --> 20:34.902
Come on, Marty,
I have to work with her.

20:34.943 --> 20:38.906
Part time. You work with her
part time. She's perfect.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.575
You don't want it
to be a stranger.

20:41.617 --> 20:44.203
We know her but
we don't really know her.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.581
She's cute, too,
in her way, and...

20:47.623 --> 20:50.334
you know she's into
this kinda thing, so...

20:50.375 --> 20:53.587
I like Didi.
I think she's sweet.

20:53.629 --> 20:57.883
I like Didi, too.
Put Didi at the top of the list.

20:57.925 --> 21:00.260
Operation Didi.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.429
Call her up,
have her for dinner.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.598
If it works out, great.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.558
If it doesn't,
I'll do the dishes.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.817
(doorbell chimes)

21:22.950 --> 21:24.743
- Hi...!
- Hi, Didi.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.246
- How are you?
- Good. Come on in.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.713
You did these?

21:36.755 --> 21:38.757
Yeah, I did.

21:38.799 --> 21:42.886
God...
Laura, they're wonderful.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.722
Thank you.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.432
Do you like my perfume?

21:49.184 --> 21:49.935
Roses.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.105
Yeah.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.236
Marty...?

22:03.574 --> 22:07.703
Didi... it's great
that you finally came over,

22:07.744 --> 22:12.416
because Laura's wanted to have you
for dinner for the longest time.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.211
You know, I don't think we need
any more wine. Drunk...

22:16.253 --> 22:19.506
- Drinks.
- Drinks...? Oh, drunk.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.675
- Let's get drunk.
- Drunk, let's get drunk.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.595
Hard drinks.
I got a big jug of rum,

22:24.595 --> 22:27.347
- does that sound good?
- I love rum. Rum and coke.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.933
I'm dangerous on rum and coke.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.269
We have a winner.
It's rum and coke.

22:32.311 --> 22:35.314
You hear that? She's dangerous
on rum and coke, this one.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.901
- Is he always this funny?
- Not always.

22:38.942 --> 22:41.445
Where you from, Dee?
Chicago or something?

22:41.445 --> 22:45.741
- I'm from all over.
- All over? Wow.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.577
Yep. I'm an Army brat.

22:48.619 --> 22:53.457
An Army brat? That is intense.
Tell us about it.

22:53.499 --> 22:57.377
I lived with my dad
until I was 14.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.964
Then out of nowhere,
I met my mom and I lived with her...

23:01.006 --> 23:03.717
until we decided
that we hated each other.

23:03.759 --> 23:09.973
Then I hitchhiked around
a little while, until I was 17

23:10.015 --> 23:13.936
and I met this woman
I lived with in Florida,

23:13.977 --> 23:17.606
but... it didn't really work out,

23:17.648 --> 23:20.817
because she was sorta
in love with me...

23:20.859 --> 23:23.612
I guess, to be honest,
I just enjoyed fucking her...

23:23.654 --> 23:25.531
(crash)

23:32.037 --> 23:33.455
Let me tell you this story...

23:33.497 --> 23:35.999
This is so nice out here.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.671
(reggae music plays softly)

23:47.344 --> 23:50.055
Wow, Didi, you should be
a professional dancer.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.598
She should.

23:52.933 --> 23:55.477
Doesn't anybody
wanna dance with me?

23:55.519 --> 23:57.271
All right, I'll dance.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.692
Oh yeah... Oh, baby...

24:06.822 --> 24:08.907
You're scaring me now.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.452
Laura, come up here.
Look at this.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.538
Laura, come dance with me.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.456
Come on... come on.

24:20.043 --> 24:25.674
Laura wanted to dance.
Didi wants to dance tonight.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.468
I wanna dance so bad...

24:29.553 --> 24:31.847
(music continues)

25:16.934 --> 25:21.563
Didi, just stay there. I need Marty
to help me with something...

25:21.605 --> 25:23.732
Marty...!

25:27.611 --> 25:28.904
What's up? Havin' fun?

25:28.946 --> 25:31.698
- No, honey, no.
- Yes.

25:31.740 --> 25:35.577
I think this might be a mistake.
We should call it a night.

25:35.619 --> 25:39.498
Call it a night? No,
we don't wanna call it a night.

25:39.540 --> 25:42.501
Are you kidding me?
We're havin' fun.

25:42.543 --> 25:45.754
- We are?
- Yes. She's hot for you, this girl.

25:45.796 --> 25:48.590
Oh, God. I know, I know...

25:50.300 --> 25:52.553
Are you sure this is what
you really want?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.721
Let me think for a millionth
of a second...

25:54.763 --> 25:56.807
Yes. Are you kiddin'?

25:56.849 --> 25:59.685
We're having fun.
We're having a good time.

25:59.726 --> 26:03.730
- You okay?
- Just fill this up.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.900
(Didi:)
Is it okay if I go swimming?

26:06.942 --> 26:09.903
Yes... go swimming,
are you kidding?

26:09.987 --> 26:12.489
Our poolo es su poolo.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.700
(Didi:)
Laura, is he always so funny?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.618
Ohh, yeah...

26:18.328 --> 26:21.081
So we got...

26:21.123 --> 26:23.208
we got a little booze here.

26:23.250 --> 26:26.962
- Are you coming in?
- Coming in...?

26:27.004 --> 26:29.256
- Ohh...!
- Yeah.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.553
I think we should go in.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.597
I'm gonna get a swimsuit.

26:37.014 --> 26:40.017
And so are you.
Come on.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.352
We're gonna get a swimsuit...

26:42.394 --> 26:45.230
and you...
just trawl around.

26:50.194 --> 26:53.655
- Hello.
- Hello.

26:57.326 --> 26:59.161
Hello.

27:07.169 --> 27:11.882
Hey... hey...
hello.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.843
Take you for a ride.
Can I borrow my wife?

27:26.146 --> 27:28.649
(Didi:)
That looks like fun.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.070
- I want one.
- Want a ride?

27:37.699 --> 27:39.993
Okay, we'll give you a ride.

27:45.958 --> 27:50.337
I'll put you up here.
You can nurse your drink...

27:50.379 --> 27:53.382
We know what your
priorities are tonight.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.927
Didi, you...
oh, Didi...!

28:05.435 --> 28:07.062
(giggling)

28:10.148 --> 28:13.610
Take me back to Laura.
I want one from Laura.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.529
You want a ride from Laura?

28:42.139 --> 28:43.765
What...?

28:46.310 --> 28:48.103
Laura, what...?

29:00.991 --> 29:04.620
Hey... what happened?
What happened down there, sweetie?

29:04.661 --> 29:08.832
I don't know...
It just got too real or something.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.128
I don't know. I felt stupid.

29:13.170 --> 29:17.591
Hey... you're not stupid.
You're not.

29:17.674 --> 29:20.469
I'm the stupid one.
This was a mistake.

29:20.511 --> 29:23.013
This was a mistake. I'm sorry.

29:23.013 --> 29:25.766
That's okay.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.100
(knocking)

29:28.769 --> 29:31.021
I'll send her home.
I'll say goodnight.

29:31.063 --> 29:34.316
No, I'll talk to her.
Let me talk to her.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.948
- Hey...
- Hi.

29:40.989 --> 29:44.827
I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel badly.

29:44.868 --> 29:47.871
You both made me
feel really comfortable,

29:47.913 --> 29:54.086
and I haven't felt comfortable
around anyone for a long time.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.798
God... you're just
so beautiful...

29:57.840 --> 30:00.259
and great...

30:02.636 --> 30:05.055
Should I go home?

30:09.142 --> 30:11.520
Can I come in, then?

30:14.439 --> 30:17.317
Yeah, you can come in.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.796
(moaning and rattling)

32:27.531 --> 32:30.033
You guys wanna knock off
and go get a drink?

32:30.075 --> 32:32.035
(moaning continues)

32:38.709 --> 32:42.004
Wow... that's what that flap is for.

32:47.885 --> 32:52.014
Don't worry about me...
I'll be back.

32:52.055 --> 32:54.099
I'll go downstairs
and get a drink, okay?

32:54.141 --> 33:00.022
Get a drink...
do a couple hundred push-ups.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.191
(moaning increases)

33:27.966 --> 33:30.219
Murphy... can't tell Murphy.
Damn, damn...

33:36.433 --> 33:39.394
(line ringing)

33:39.436 --> 33:40.562
Hi.

33:42.773 --> 33:45.484
You're not gonna believe this.

33:45.526 --> 33:50.572
My wife, right now,
is upstairs - in my bedroom...

33:50.614 --> 33:54.201
with little Didi...

33:54.243 --> 33:56.411
the hottie at work...

33:56.453 --> 33:59.581
and the two of them
are tearing into each other...

33:59.623 --> 34:03.836
like there's no tomorrow...
Yeah, yeah, it gets better.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.629
I'm up there.
I'm part of the package.

34:05.671 --> 34:08.047
Yeah - no,
I'm just taking a break.

34:09.091 --> 34:11.885
What...? No.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.304
I don't wanna order a pizza.
I was just calling.

34:14.346 --> 34:16.223
I had to tell someone.

34:23.856 --> 34:26.108
(moaning continues)

34:30.529 --> 34:32.364
Hey, you guys...

34:36.618 --> 34:38.078
Marty's back.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.788
Hey, honey...

34:49.255 --> 34:52.092
Oh, shit. Damn.

34:57.347 --> 34:59.224
Hey... Hi.

34:59.266 --> 35:01.435
Hi.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.563
- Bye.
- You leaving?

35:05.689 --> 35:08.192
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

35:08.233 --> 35:11.278
You too...
I mean, bye.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.780
Thank you. See ya.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.616
Bye.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.829
Hey.

35:21.955 --> 35:24.041
- How you doin'?
- Did you sleep well?

35:24.082 --> 35:26.460
I did. How about you?

35:26.502 --> 35:29.963
I had a good sleep.
I feel so rested.

35:31.673 --> 35:34.676
You okay? Everything okay
with last night?

35:34.718 --> 35:37.137
I'm okay. Are you okay?

35:37.179 --> 35:41.850
Me? I'm very okay.
Especially if you're okay.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.894
Oh, yeah, I am, I am.

35:43.936 --> 35:47.356
You know what last night was?
I think it was educational.

35:47.397 --> 35:52.194
Educational? I love to hear you
use the word educational.

35:52.236 --> 35:55.364
That's great. You see?
You were worried.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.407
And now, you're educated.

35:57.449 --> 35:59.743
Oh, yeah.

35:59.785 --> 36:03.121
Do you want some breakfast?
I'm going to have a giant breakfast.

36:04.414 --> 36:10.128
So everything's okay, seriously?
No weirdness...

36:10.170 --> 36:13.048
Oh, no, I'm cool.

36:13.090 --> 36:16.093
Now I know what you mean by
the "home court advantage" thing.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.803
Wow.

36:17.845 --> 36:18.428
(Radio:)
Wow.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.013
My scene is done actually
at my apartment.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.432
- Your actual apartment?
- On my fire escape.

36:22.474 --> 36:24.893
I have another scene,
a lesbian scene...

36:24.935 --> 36:26.186
- Really?
- Which you will love.

36:26.228 --> 36:27.563
Oh, I most certainly will.

36:27.604 --> 36:30.899
- Girls.
- Have you been out to the site yet?

36:30.941 --> 36:33.569
No, I have not been to the site.

36:33.610 --> 36:36.738
Just want to know if you saw
the changes in the kitchen plan.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.575
- No, I haven't seen them.
- I know what you're gonna say...

36:39.616 --> 36:41.994
You're gonna say it costs too much.
I've been thinking about it...

36:42.035 --> 36:44.037
and it ain't all about money.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.622
You don't know
what I'm gonna say,

36:45.664 --> 36:47.749
'cause that's not what I was
gonna say, 'cause you're right.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.918
It ain't all about money.

36:50.794 --> 36:54.047
What's your deal?
Fighting with your wife again?

36:54.089 --> 36:57.050
She has burrowed her way
up inside my asshole.

36:57.134 --> 36:59.094
Being married is very tough.

36:59.136 --> 37:01.471
Yes, but it's only as tough
as you make it.

37:01.513 --> 37:03.974
It's only as tough as you make it.

37:04.016 --> 37:06.435
Know why you guys
are having trouble at home?

37:06.476 --> 37:08.896
- You wanna know?
- Why?

37:08.937 --> 37:12.107
- You're not shakin' it up.
- Excuse me?

37:12.149 --> 37:15.569
That's all we're talking about here.
Shake it up.

37:15.611 --> 37:19.573
- Shake it up?
- Yes. Shake it up.

37:19.656 --> 37:22.075
You're the man.
That's your responsibility.

37:22.117 --> 37:26.079
The women wanna be led.
They wanna be taught new tricks.

37:26.121 --> 37:28.081
They wanna be shaken up.

37:28.165 --> 37:30.792
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:30.834 --> 37:34.296
I'm talking about you,
going home...

37:34.338 --> 37:36.465
and you, going home...

37:36.507 --> 37:40.052
and teaching your wife
a couple of new tricks.

37:40.093 --> 37:43.847
You will find the picture
changes very quickly.

37:46.558 --> 37:48.477
Shake it up, boys.

38:34.565 --> 38:36.400
(doorbell rings)

38:36.441 --> 38:39.278
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

38:39.319 --> 38:40.904
Why don't you go see?

38:47.244 --> 38:49.705
(doorbell rings)

39:00.382 --> 39:03.051
- It's Didi.
- Didi?

39:03.093 --> 39:04.928
I wonder who called her?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.560
(yelping and banging)

39:22.279 --> 39:25.824
You two are on fire tonight.
Look at you.

39:28.702 --> 39:33.707
Babe...? You okay?
Do you want to rest for a minute?

39:36.126 --> 39:38.545
Can I talk to you for a minute?

39:38.587 --> 39:41.381
Yeah, honey?

39:41.423 --> 39:43.258
Are you okay?

39:43.300 --> 39:45.052
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:45.093 --> 39:48.138
For a minute, I thought
you were having trouble breathing.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.933
- No...
- Don't stop.

39:52.935 --> 39:55.854
(moaning resumes)

40:07.491 --> 40:09.535
(cries and thumping)

40:20.295 --> 40:21.964
Hey.

40:29.263 --> 40:31.223
Hey, you guys...

40:33.308 --> 40:36.061
Hey... hey, Didi...

40:37.771 --> 40:40.023
Hi.

40:40.065 --> 40:42.359
- Guys having fun?
- Yeah.

40:44.278 --> 40:45.988
Want me to bring up sandwiches?

40:46.029 --> 40:49.199
Don't stop, don't stop.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.660
(moans resume)

40:56.623 --> 40:58.834
(Ioud cries and bumping)

41:25.152 --> 41:27.404
Bye, Marty. See ya.

41:29.490 --> 41:31.116
Bye.

41:31.909 --> 41:34.369
"Bye, Marty. See ya."

41:34.411 --> 41:36.330
(Radio:)
You wanna stand up for us?

41:36.371 --> 41:40.209
Oh, please do.
You are a hottie.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.835
Are you very proud
of yourself naked?

41:41.877 --> 41:43.545
I wouldn't say "proud",
just comfortable.

41:43.587 --> 41:45.380
- Have you ever done lesbianism?
- No...

41:50.093 --> 41:51.762
- Hi.
- Diva.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.555
What are you doing here?

41:53.597 --> 41:55.182
The Pembrokes are coming over.

41:55.224 --> 41:57.100
Laura called and asked me
to help with the big brunch.

41:57.142 --> 42:00.395
- You didn't know about it?
- No... Laura called you?

42:00.437 --> 42:02.814
I though it was a great idea.
Hi!

42:02.856 --> 42:06.151
- You look great.
- Look at you, you look fabulous.

42:06.193 --> 42:07.528
Come on in.

42:14.451 --> 42:17.204
- Marty, how are ya?
- Hi, Marty.

42:17.246 --> 42:20.624
Dave, Evie, how are you guys?
Good to see you.

42:23.627 --> 42:25.879
You look amazing.
Look at you.

42:25.921 --> 42:28.257
Both of you. You look great.

42:28.298 --> 42:30.509
I'm not feeling too great.
My wife beat me at tennis.

42:30.551 --> 42:33.971
You look great. This guy
looks 22 years old...

42:34.012 --> 42:36.849
like he did in Michigan,
this guy.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.851
Marty, your wife looks adorable.

42:38.892 --> 42:42.646
Thank you. She is adorable,
but look at this guy.

42:42.688 --> 42:45.440
Both of you look fantastic.

42:45.482 --> 42:49.361
That's it. We're in trouble.
Way too many "you look greats".

42:49.403 --> 42:52.239
Marty, get me a drink.
I wanna be good and hammered

42:52.281 --> 42:54.158
when you start slamming me
for that loan.

42:54.199 --> 42:56.952
Oh, come on. That's not
what this is about.

42:56.994 --> 42:59.538
I want you to have a nice
Sunday brunch with us.

42:59.580 --> 43:02.416
Marty, get the "great-Iookin' guy"
a drink, will ya?

43:02.457 --> 43:04.710
Fine. How about you, Evie?
You need to get hammered?

43:04.751 --> 43:06.920
- A Bloody Mary, sweetie.
- Comin' right up.

43:06.962 --> 43:09.173
I'll get one too.
We'll all get slammed.

43:11.008 --> 43:13.218
- Look overdone to you?
- I'm not eating that.

43:13.260 --> 43:17.014
You know, Diva,
you look really beautiful today.

43:18.307 --> 43:20.642
Thank you, Laura.
So do you.

43:22.603 --> 43:24.688
I love your hair.

43:26.398 --> 43:28.442
I like your hair.

43:32.696 --> 43:34.490
What is that scent?

43:35.407 --> 43:37.159
Do you like it?

43:38.035 --> 43:39.995
Oh, yeah...

43:40.037 --> 43:41.914
I like it.

43:46.126 --> 43:48.045
I'll take those.

43:51.256 --> 43:53.175
You remember Dave Pembroke?

43:53.217 --> 43:56.345
- I remember...
- His wife, Evie,

43:56.386 --> 43:58.013
Billy's wife, Carol...

43:58.055 --> 43:59.598
(exchanging greetings)

44:01.475 --> 44:03.477
No, Billy, we're gonna put
you in the middle.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.561
Billy sits here.

44:04.603 --> 44:06.146
Billy will be in the middle.

44:06.188 --> 44:08.690
- Don't fight over me.
- And I'll put Diva right here.

44:08.732 --> 44:11.026
- It's fine, honey.
- I'll get another chair.

44:11.068 --> 44:13.612
Thank you. Come on,
you sit here.

44:17.407 --> 44:20.244
Just want you to know
who runs this house...

44:20.285 --> 44:22.371
Laura.

44:23.997 --> 44:25.374
It's good to see you, man.

44:25.415 --> 44:28.669
Good to see you, too.
I remember your older brother.

44:28.710 --> 44:31.672
Oh, Jesus.
Are you still kickin' ass?

44:31.713 --> 44:34.550
I remember when you and he
took on the Statler twins...

44:37.427 --> 44:38.846
Sausage?

44:40.013 --> 44:41.849
No.

44:41.890 --> 44:45.310
Let's hope marriage and California
have settled him down.

44:45.352 --> 44:50.357
He's settled down.
He's just a big pushover now.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.860
Somehow, Evie,
I kinda doubt that...

44:53.235 --> 44:56.822
(Billy:)
Marty tells me you're doing good.

44:56.864 --> 44:59.241
(Marty:)
Good? He's got 18 furniture stores...

44:59.283 --> 45:03.328
Excuse me...
I'm gonna help Lucia in the kitchen.

45:03.370 --> 45:05.789
Okay, help Lucia in the kitchen.

45:08.083 --> 45:10.252
Billy... you need a place setting.

45:10.294 --> 45:12.379
Lucia will get it.
Lucia...!

45:12.421 --> 45:13.881
That's okay...

45:13.964 --> 45:15.757
- Laura, sit down, please...
- It's fine...

45:15.799 --> 45:19.595
I know exactly where it is.
I'm gonna go help Diva.

45:19.636 --> 45:22.097
I don't want your food to get cold.
It's the Pembrokes...

45:22.139 --> 45:24.600
I'm gonna go help Diva, okay?

45:28.478 --> 45:30.314
Careful with the butter.

45:33.650 --> 45:36.153
Diva, I am so sorry.

45:36.195 --> 45:38.447
I really am sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into me...

45:38.489 --> 45:40.449
I feel like a pig.

45:40.491 --> 45:42.326
What is going on?

45:44.995 --> 45:49.291
Marty told me this thing
about you in college, seeing girls,

45:49.333 --> 45:54.171
ever since he told me,
I can't get it or you out of my mind.

45:54.213 --> 45:56.256
You know I'm getting married
in two months, right?

45:56.340 --> 45:58.675
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

45:58.717 --> 46:01.970
I do. Like I said before,
I'm sorry.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.935
- I'm just so attracted to you.
- Laura...!

46:07.976 --> 46:11.313
You ever see
the Statler Twins, Dave?

46:11.355 --> 46:15.108
Do I see them? No.
They still live back in Michigan.

46:15.901 --> 46:17.986
You ever see any
of the guys you beat up?

46:18.028 --> 46:19.738
Just curious.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.115
First of all, I didn't beat
that many guys up.

46:22.157 --> 46:23.992
Second of all, no...

46:24.034 --> 46:26.870
I left Michigan after high school,
and I haven't been back.

46:26.912 --> 46:28.747
Must be kinda weird
to run into somebody

46:28.789 --> 46:31.792
20 years after you beat 'em up.
Remember me?

46:31.875 --> 46:35.212
You broke my clavicle?
You look good.

46:35.254 --> 46:39.675
I'm sorry, Diva.
I'm really sorry.

46:39.716 --> 46:43.220
You should be.
I'm really not into women.

46:44.721 --> 46:46.473
Me neither.

47:01.405 --> 47:04.616
Oh, my God... Oh, my God.

47:04.658 --> 47:07.327
Oh, my God... okay.

47:09.121 --> 47:11.957
Laura, I'm gonna go.

47:11.999 --> 47:14.960
I think that's the best thing
in this situation.

47:15.002 --> 47:19.214
I'm gonna go.
I'm straight... I am.

47:19.256 --> 47:22.384
I'm straight... I am.

47:22.426 --> 47:26.889
What we're talking about,
we have ten lots we can obtain.

47:26.930 --> 47:31.059
These houses finished
are at a million, million two...

47:31.101 --> 47:34.188
We have seven, seven and a quarter
in some of the houses.

47:34.229 --> 47:36.690
Okay, I'm gonna say goodbye.

47:36.773 --> 47:38.233
Something wrong, Diva?

47:38.275 --> 47:40.402
No...

47:40.444 --> 47:42.571
I gotta be somewhere,
I'm running really straight...

47:42.613 --> 47:46.742
late... I'm running really late.
I'm gonna go.

47:50.412 --> 47:53.081
Just stay awhile.
Marty...?

47:53.415 --> 47:54.875
Tell Diva not to go.

47:54.917 --> 47:59.254
Diva, don't go
Bye...

47:59.296 --> 48:01.340
No... don't.
Please stay.

48:01.381 --> 48:03.592
Laura, I have to go now.

48:03.634 --> 48:05.302
Let me walk you to the door.

48:05.344 --> 48:07.930
I know where the door is.

48:07.971 --> 48:11.642
I'll walk her to the door.

48:11.683 --> 48:15.312
- I'm sorry.
- Honey, don't be silly.

48:15.354 --> 48:17.856
Really...
You've got guests...

48:17.898 --> 48:19.983
I'll walk her to the door.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.944
You're in the middle
of important business...

48:21.985 --> 48:24.780
I'll walk her to the door.
Can I talk to you?

48:24.822 --> 48:28.575
Diva, don't go anywhere.
Please.

48:28.617 --> 48:30.118
I just wanna talk to you
before you go.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.329
I won't go.

48:32.371 --> 48:34.164
Promise me you won't go.

48:34.206 --> 48:36.083
Let me hold your purse.

48:37.167 --> 48:39.795
- One minute... be right back.
- Don't go, babe.

48:44.383 --> 48:47.511
- What's going on!?
- Nothing.

48:47.553 --> 48:50.138
- I just want her to stay.
- You want Diva to stay?

48:50.180 --> 48:52.933
I want us both
to be with her tonight.

48:52.975 --> 48:55.394
You want us to be with Diva?

48:55.435 --> 48:57.688
Are you crazy?
Do you have any idea...

48:57.729 --> 49:01.150
how important this brunch is to me?
You've got to know.

49:01.191 --> 49:03.944
You've got to admit
that she is foxy.

49:03.986 --> 49:07.781
She's foxy? What are you,
K.D. Lang? Are you out of your mind?

49:07.823 --> 49:11.577
This will be good for us.
I just want you to be happy...

49:11.618 --> 49:13.829
Don't touch me.
You want me to be happy?

49:13.871 --> 49:15.747
- Yes.
- Good. Listen...

49:15.789 --> 49:18.834
Let her go home,
and you snap out of it.

49:18.876 --> 49:22.504
Honey, I know you think
she 's fine.

49:22.546 --> 49:26.175
You're being a nutcase.
Snap out of it.

49:29.678 --> 49:31.805
Billy, can you get Laura a bagel?

49:31.847 --> 49:32.514
I'm gonna walk Diva to the door.

49:32.556 --> 49:34.600
I'm gonna walk Diva... I...

49:40.856 --> 49:42.524
- Go sit down.
- You let me in!

49:42.566 --> 49:44.401
Sit the fuck down!

49:44.443 --> 49:45.986
(snarling)

49:46.069 --> 49:48.113
Go...!

49:54.411 --> 49:57.456
- What's going on?
- Nothing...

49:57.498 --> 49:59.666
Marty... did you ask your wife
to hit on me?

49:59.708 --> 50:02.961
- No...!
- Is that what's going on?

50:03.003 --> 50:05.881
Why would I do that?
What am I, a deviate?

50:05.923 --> 50:07.466
Why would I ask my wife
to hit on a woman...?

50:07.508 --> 50:10.302
Because she just did.
She hit on me big time.

50:10.344 --> 50:13.096
Okay, so why do I get blamed?
I had nothing to do with it.

50:13.138 --> 50:15.057
She did it on her own.

50:16.892 --> 50:19.728
- She did it on her own?
- Yes. She's going through something.

50:19.770 --> 50:20.813
She's going throught something?

50:20.854 --> 50:22.314
She's having a breakdown or something.

50:22.356 --> 50:24.733
- A breakdown?
- It's not a big deal.

50:24.775 --> 50:26.318
I'm just gonna say goodbye.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.028
- I think I'm gonna talk to her...
- No...

50:28.070 --> 50:31.532
Diva, no. Just gonna say goodbye.
Thank you... Agggh!

50:31.573 --> 50:33.033
Didi!?

50:33.116 --> 50:34.993
I don't need to talk to you.
I need to see Laura.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.203
No, wait, Didi...!

50:36.245 --> 50:40.082
Gotta make sure we own
or have the rights to the lots...

50:40.123 --> 50:41.375
Wait...!

50:41.959 --> 50:46.964
Hi, Laura.
I need to show you something.

50:47.005 --> 50:49.049
I'm sorry to barge in...
Hi...

50:49.091 --> 50:51.677
- Hi, I'm Didi.
- This is Didi.

50:51.718 --> 50:54.221
Dave and Evie Pembroke.
Billy and Carol you know.

50:54.304 --> 50:55.973
This is our friend, Didi...

50:56.014 --> 51:01.270
who forgot her purse
and has now located it.

51:01.311 --> 51:03.605
I'm gonna walk her to the door.

51:05.482 --> 51:10.279
This is a brochure on an arts fair
and sympo-see-um in Monterrey.

51:10.320 --> 51:13.157
A symposium?

51:13.198 --> 51:16.743
Dave, I'll be with you
in a minute...

51:16.785 --> 51:18.579
Say goodbye, okay?

51:18.620 --> 51:20.956
Let go of my...
you're being an asshole.

51:20.998 --> 51:23.458
I'm not being an asshole...

51:23.500 --> 51:25.919
Let go of me, pen dick.

51:25.961 --> 51:27.796
Join us, Didi.

51:27.838 --> 51:30.215
Honey, join us...?

51:30.257 --> 51:32.593
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

51:32.634 --> 51:34.845
You're the one that wanted me
to sleep with her.

51:34.887 --> 51:38.891
Why am I so upset?
Because I think you single-handedly

51:38.932 --> 51:41.810
blew the Pembroke deal, Laura.
That's why I'm so upset.

51:41.852 --> 51:45.814
I don't know what's gotten into you.
Honestly, I don't know.

51:45.856 --> 51:47.399
What do you mean,
what has gotten into me?

51:47.441 --> 51:49.568
Are you gay?
Are you gay now?

51:49.610 --> 51:52.362
No, I am not gay...

51:52.404 --> 51:54.406
Are you bi?

51:54.448 --> 51:59.786
No... I don't know...
I thought I knew, but now I don't.

52:01.914 --> 52:04.374
I was watching some
of your moves the other night...

52:04.416 --> 52:06.460
It was like watching
an old pro work.

52:06.543 --> 52:09.421
I thought I was at a Pavarotti
concert for a minute.

52:09.463 --> 52:12.466
Have you been with Didi before?
Tell the truth.

52:12.549 --> 52:15.802
No, I haven't.
I haven't been with Didi before.

52:17.095 --> 52:21.183
Before two weeks ago,
I had never slept with a woman.

52:21.225 --> 52:22.768
That's the truth.

52:22.809 --> 52:25.312
You wouldn't know that
by watchin' you work.

52:26.396 --> 52:30.317
I know that...
I know that, because...

52:30.400 --> 52:33.737
It's... you know what it is?
That "home court advantage" thing...

52:33.779 --> 52:38.742
I knew... you were gonna say that.
Know how I knew?

52:38.784 --> 52:42.454
Ask me...
you know how I knew?

52:42.496 --> 52:43.705
How do you know, Marty?

52:43.747 --> 52:46.375
Because I made the "home court
advantage" thing up.

52:46.416 --> 52:48.043
It's bullshit, and I made it up.

52:48.085 --> 52:50.045
- But it's true. It is true...
- No, it's bullshit...

52:50.087 --> 52:52.297
Don't bullshit a bullshit artist.

52:52.339 --> 52:54.550
I'm telling you, it's true.

52:54.591 --> 52:57.678
It was like I knew exactly
what to do to please Didi,

52:57.761 --> 53:01.431
And it was so... my God,
it was so powerful,

53:01.473 --> 53:05.227
and it was nice, then - God -
she did these things to me,

53:05.269 --> 53:08.397
and I thought I was
just gonna melt and gyrate...

53:08.438 --> 53:11.525
I was there. I don't need to hear
the minutes read back, okay?

53:11.567 --> 53:13.944
I was in the room. That was me...

53:13.986 --> 53:16.321
The guy with his thumb up his ass.
That was me.

53:20.617 --> 53:23.412
- Marty?
- Yeah?

53:23.453 --> 53:26.832
I need to leave early today.
Donald and I are going to Big Bear

53:26.874 --> 53:31.211
to check out this banquet hall.
There's a giant moose head

53:31.253 --> 53:33.964
he's convinced should be
the centerpiece for our reception,

53:34.006 --> 53:36.049
I have to be there to tell him
how wrong he is.

53:36.133 --> 53:40.679
- All right, take the day off.
Listen, Diva...

53:40.721 --> 53:44.224
- About yesterday...
- No, Marty, don't worry about it.

53:44.308 --> 53:46.268
It's cool.

54:09.500 --> 54:10.918
Laura?

54:13.795 --> 54:15.380
Laura?

54:16.840 --> 54:18.592
(squeaking and giggling)

54:18.634 --> 54:20.719
What...?

54:22.554 --> 54:26.767
Diva?
I can't believe this.

54:26.808 --> 54:30.229
- Marty, don't be upset.
- Don't be upset? What should I be?

54:30.270 --> 54:33.524
My wife and assistant
are in bed together, what should I be?

54:33.565 --> 54:35.651
It's not like that.

54:35.692 --> 54:36.276
- Oh, it's not like that?
- No...

54:36.360 --> 54:40.989
What's it like? It is like that.
You're screwing around on me.

54:41.031 --> 54:43.450
She's not screwing around
on you, I promise.

54:43.492 --> 54:46.620
Diva, you lied, okay?
You lied.

54:46.662 --> 54:48.205
You said you were going
to look at a moose head,

54:48.247 --> 54:51.250
which I gotta say, is the exact
opposite of what you're looking at.

54:51.291 --> 54:54.670
Marty, the showing got cancelled.
I didn't lie to you.

54:54.711 --> 54:56.004
We decided not to go.

54:56.046 --> 54:58.507
Okay, good! Go back to work.

54:58.549 --> 55:02.261
Don't come here and burrow your head
between my wife's legs.

55:02.302 --> 55:05.138
Marty? Why are you doing this?

55:05.180 --> 55:11.061
This... was for you.
We are warming up for you.

55:11.103 --> 55:14.106
"Warming up"? Waiting for me?

55:14.148 --> 55:16.608
Yes, this was supposed
to be a surprise,

55:16.650 --> 55:20.904
'cause I was planning
a little three-way... for you.

55:20.946 --> 55:22.865
A surprise for me?

55:22.906 --> 55:25.659
Yes - so, come on in, babe.

55:25.701 --> 55:29.079
Laura, do you really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

55:29.121 --> 55:31.707
(groaning and thumping)

55:36.461 --> 55:41.091
Okay... that was a good
surprise three-way, we can stop.

55:46.388 --> 55:48.515
Okay, Laura, everyone's good
and warmed up.

55:52.644 --> 55:54.438
Okay, Laura...

55:56.690 --> 56:00.694
How stupid do I look?
"Warming up" for me...?

56:02.112 --> 56:05.741
Warming up for me?
How stupid do I look, huh?!

56:08.577 --> 56:11.371
(Billy:)
What's up? You seem a little low.

56:11.413 --> 56:14.374
(Marty:)
Low? Yeah, I guess.

56:14.458 --> 56:18.003
- What's up?
- Nothin'.

56:18.045 --> 56:19.421
Come on, what's goin' on?

56:19.463 --> 56:23.425
Laura and I...
are going through something.

56:23.467 --> 56:26.136
What, is she sleeping
with a woman?

56:27.763 --> 56:31.099
You guessed that?
Who told you that?

56:31.141 --> 56:34.937
- You guessed that?
- What, did I guess right?

56:34.978 --> 56:39.191
Wait a minute. Your wife,
is sleeping with another woman?

56:40.359 --> 56:43.654
If you wanna get technical,
she's sleeping with two women.

56:43.695 --> 56:46.698
Your wife is sleeping
with a couple of women?!

56:46.740 --> 56:48.367
Wow.

56:48.408 --> 56:51.286
I begged and I pushed...

56:51.328 --> 56:54.122
and it happened.

56:54.164 --> 56:56.041
Good for you.

56:56.083 --> 56:57.793
Actually, it gets worse.

56:57.835 --> 56:59.294
You mean, it gets better.

56:59.336 --> 57:03.173
No... it gets worse.

57:03.215 --> 57:05.467
She's doing Diva.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.178
Diva?

57:08.220 --> 57:10.639
Your wife is sleeping
with your assistant, Diva?

57:10.681 --> 57:12.266
Diva - Diva?

57:12.307 --> 57:14.935
Yes... yes.

57:14.977 --> 57:17.938
It's not funny, Murphy.
It's not funny.

57:18.021 --> 57:21.358
Did she happen to mention
if she was any good?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.569
It's not funny, Murphy!

57:23.610 --> 57:25.696
All right, I'm sorry.
But, you know...

57:25.737 --> 57:28.282
it's a video I would
definitely go and rent.

57:29.783 --> 57:32.828
So, Jane, how was your week?

57:32.870 --> 57:34.830
Eventful, I hope?

57:34.872 --> 57:37.666
Not as eventful as Laura's.

57:39.209 --> 57:43.130
You told her? I can't believe it.
That's a breach.

57:43.213 --> 57:47.092
Honey, she's my best friend.
I tell her everything.

57:47.134 --> 57:49.011
Apparently, you do.

57:49.052 --> 57:51.513
Are you gonna tell me
you didn't tell Billy and Murphy?

57:51.555 --> 57:54.892
No, I didn't. Of course not.
I wouldn't do that.

57:55.893 --> 57:58.020
- Did she tell you everything?
- Oh, yeah.

57:58.061 --> 58:00.355
She tell you
she seduced my assistant?

58:00.355 --> 58:03.358
- I love it.
- You love it?

58:03.358 --> 58:06.195
Good, Jane,
egg her on, that's good.

58:06.236 --> 58:08.530
After dinner, we'll go to the Forum,

58:08.572 --> 58:10.699
they're playing
women's basketball tonight,

58:10.741 --> 58:14.203
she can just do the whole team.
How's that?

58:14.244 --> 58:16.163
Just throw her in the locker room.

58:30.344 --> 58:34.097
Hey! Open up.
Remember me?

58:34.139 --> 58:36.475
The guy barely paying the mortgage?
Come on.

58:36.517 --> 58:38.936
(Laura:)
Okay, I'm coming. Hold on.

58:41.146 --> 58:43.482
Why's the door locked?
What are you doing?

58:43.524 --> 58:45.734
- Nothing.
- You're alone...?

58:45.776 --> 58:48.529
You're in here alone?

58:48.570 --> 58:51.073
Yeah, I'm alone.

58:51.114 --> 58:53.534
Hi, Marty.

58:53.575 --> 58:55.828
Marty, don't be mad.

58:55.869 --> 58:57.913
Diva! Jane...!

58:57.955 --> 59:02.084
Hello, pen dick.
Guess who brought the play toys?

59:02.125 --> 59:05.087
Laura...!

59:05.128 --> 59:07.714
Hey, Marty...

59:07.756 --> 59:11.385
don't be mad.
It's just a little nightmare.

59:18.016 --> 59:20.561
You had a dream...
that they had an orgy,

59:20.602 --> 59:21.937
and locked you out.

59:21.979 --> 59:25.274
Not a dream, a nightmare.

59:25.315 --> 59:27.734
Three incredible women,
lying around,

59:27.776 --> 59:30.445
lapping up
the little man in the canoe,

59:30.487 --> 59:32.197
where is the nightmare in that?

59:32.239 --> 59:34.449
The nightmare is,
they want nothing to do with me.

59:34.491 --> 59:36.285
I was locked outside the door.

59:36.326 --> 59:39.079
That speaks of sexual
inadequacy to me.

59:39.121 --> 59:39.872
Exactly.

59:39.913 --> 59:41.415
What are you talking about?

59:41.456 --> 59:43.542
It was your dream,
all I'm sayin' is...

59:43.584 --> 59:45.460
if that were me,
in that situation,

59:45.502 --> 59:48.088
and I found myself
locked outside the bedroom door,

59:48.130 --> 59:50.090
with my schmekel in my mitt,

59:50.174 --> 59:52.342
I'd be thinking about sex therapy.
That's all I'm sayin'.

59:57.097 --> 59:59.266
Are you mad, Marty?

59:59.308 --> 01:00:01.268
Don't be mad.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.645
Mad? I'm not mad,
I'm worried.

01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:06.231
I'm justifiably worried.

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:09.693
Honey, you shouldn't be.
I'm just experimenting as a woman.

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:12.488
- Really, it's nice.
- Oh, that's nice...

01:00:12.488 --> 01:00:13.655
it's "nice".

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:18.494
Obviously, I've been hiding
things from you... from myself...

01:00:18.494 --> 01:00:24.208
It's gonna be okay. Either way,
it's not a big deal, all right?

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:26.502
Tomorrow I'm going to Vegas,
and the drive...

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:29.838
and the time away,
will be good for me. Okay?

01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:32.799
You're going to Vegas
with my sister.

01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:36.512
Listen, I'm beggin' you.
This is my baby sister.

01:00:36.553 --> 01:00:39.014
- This is my baby sister.
- Marty, stop it.

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.266
- We go to Vegas every year...
- This isn't every year!

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:44.478
I am not going to disappoint her.
Nothing is going to happen.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.396
Would you just relax?

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:48.357
All set, Laura.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:51.276
I'm rarin' and ready to go.

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:53.862
I am your prisoner
for the next 24 hours.

01:00:53.904 --> 01:00:55.405
Just... do with me what you will.

01:00:55.447 --> 01:00:57.032
Oh, God...

01:00:57.074 --> 01:00:59.785
Listen to me,
we need to postpone this,

01:00:59.827 --> 01:01:01.370
just till we get you professional help.

01:01:01.411 --> 01:01:03.247
I don't need professional help, Marty.

01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:06.250
Okay, I got a good compromise.
Separate rooms, okay?

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.087
On the far side of the hotel.

01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:12.005
You can be in the east wing,
she can be in the west wing.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.174
You're on thin ice here, Laura,
thin ice...

01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:16.552
- Laura, sweetie...
- Bye.

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:18.679
No, don't go! No, wait...

01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:21.181
Bye, Marty!

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:26.145
Laura, don't you dare have sex
with my baby sister!

01:01:54.715 --> 01:01:56.258
(knocking)

01:01:57.843 --> 01:02:00.387
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Murphy.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.931
- Made myself a little sandwich.
- No problem.

01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:04.057
Where's Laura?

01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:06.226
She's in Vegas with my sister.

01:02:08.145 --> 01:02:09.938
Is she diddling your sister?

01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:12.774
She is?

01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:14.193
I didn't say that.

01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:19.156
Your wife is diddling your sister...!

01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:21.074
Your wife is diddling your sister?

01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:24.620
Your wife - is diddling your sister?!

01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:26.955
That's great!

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:28.874
Your wife is diddling your sister?

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:32.503
Hey, who can blame her?
Your sister's a hottie.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:35.088
Can I use your phone?
I wanna call my wife,

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.341
I'd like to set the two of them up
for a little lunch.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.470
(car approaching)

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:45.182
Ellen, baby... hi.
Have fun?

01:02:45.224 --> 01:02:47.684
Look at this, you're dressed alike...?

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:50.979
You're all happy, look at you,
you're happy.

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:54.191
You won? Is that what happened,
you won?

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:57.444
No? You lost, and you're all smiley
'cause you lost?

01:02:57.486 --> 01:02:59.780
Actually, we didn't gamble.

01:02:59.822 --> 01:03:01.615
No, no gambling.

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:04.618
I'll see you soon.
I had a wonderful time.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:05.786
So did I. Bye.

01:03:05.828 --> 01:03:09.122
Wonderful? What do you mean,
"wonderful"?

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:12.626
You saw shows? You
went shopping... right?

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.962
- No shows.
- No shows...?

01:03:15.003 --> 01:03:18.465
Laura... tell me you didn't
have sex with my sister.

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:20.843
I didn't have sex with your sister.

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:24.179
I mean, not like you're thinking.
Not really.

01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:27.391
Not really? What does that mean,
"not really"?

01:03:27.432 --> 01:03:29.893
How do you "not really"
have sex with someone's sister?

01:03:29.935 --> 01:03:33.438
We talked, we held each other,
and it was really nice.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.275
You know what? It's been so long
since anybody's touched her.

01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:38.360
Don't tell me that.
I don't wanna know that.

01:03:38.402 --> 01:03:42.322
Do you want breakfast?
I'm gonna have a giant breakfast.

01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:44.741
This is becoming
a nightmare with you.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:47.244
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

01:03:47.286 --> 01:03:50.164
You're taking this the wrong way.
I am feeling so great.

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.540
Oh, good.

01:03:51.582 --> 01:03:52.749
This is going
to be good for us.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:56.253
"Good for us"...? How is this
going to be good for us?!

01:03:56.295 --> 01:03:59.089
You had sex with my sister!
Hey...

01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:02.050
big family reunion coming,
why don't you make a wish list?

01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:05.512
Well, that's it.
I've blown it.

01:04:05.554 --> 01:04:08.557
Turned her into a sex monster.

01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:10.934
She's gonna leave me, too, Billy.
I can feel it.

01:04:10.976 --> 01:04:13.604
You haven't blown it.
She's not going anywhere.

01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:16.190
So she likes girls, big deal.
So do you.

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:18.317
Now you got something in common.

01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:21.862
This is what you wanted.
Relax. Enjoy it.

01:04:21.904 --> 01:04:24.781
Easy for you to say, BIIly.
It's not your wife.

01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:28.118
If it was my wife,
I'd be diggin' it.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.412
But that ain't never gonna happen.

01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:32.915
Carol's too damned hungry
to bother having sex.

01:04:56.647 --> 01:04:59.107
Hey, just spoke with Pembroke.

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:01.109
Got some pretty good news for ya...

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:04.279
- Guy sounds very interested...
- Yeah?

01:05:06.657 --> 01:05:08.534
What was that for?

01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:11.537
That's for you
and your wife's big mouth.

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:16.625
I'm sorry, honey.
I did tell Carol

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:20.587
about what you told me
about Billy's girlfriend.

01:05:20.629 --> 01:05:22.339
I'm sorry.

01:05:23.674 --> 01:05:27.135
I was in a weakened state,
and we were talking,

01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:30.597
she was vulnerable...

01:05:30.681 --> 01:05:34.309
she was hungry and she needed
someone to share a pizza with.

01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:36.979
And not be judged for it.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.482
She really needed me.
Carol really needed me.

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:42.693
She did.

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:47.489
Hey, Marty, how's that hot
little wife of yours?

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:49.575
Wouldn't mind gettin' me
some of that action.

01:05:51.743 --> 01:05:53.287
I'd bang your wife so hard, Marty,

01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:55.789
you'd think a brass band
was coming down the street.

01:05:55.831 --> 01:05:59.209
Who's my bitch? I'd have her
screaming,"Who's my bitch?"

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:01.795
I would go so far down
on your wife,

01:06:01.837 --> 01:06:04.506
you'd need a passport
to get her out of Central America.

01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:08.969
I was with your wife so long,
I gotta put my tongue in a sling.

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:11.972
I'd chew her box
like a fuckin' hamster.

01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:13.807
Nng-nng-nyagh!

01:06:27.362 --> 01:06:28.447
Hey, babe.

01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:31.492
Dr. Berman called.
He wants you to come right away.

01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:41.835
Well, Marty, we found a polyp.

01:06:43.462 --> 01:06:45.005
We need to take it out.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:49.176
- Take it out?
- Does that mean surgery?

01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:52.888
We do it here, now, run a test
and make sure it's benign.

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:55.974
Do it right here?

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:58.977
It's a very simple procedure, really.

01:06:59.019 --> 01:07:02.898
Little prep work, one machine,
works with lasers.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.150
Nice machines. Made by Sony.

01:07:05.192 --> 01:07:07.528
Sony?

01:07:10.906 --> 01:07:13.534
So... did I tell ya
I bought that Porsche Boxter?

01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:22.751
Sweetie, wake up.
Wake up, honey.

01:07:22.793 --> 01:07:25.420
- You need to eat.
- I'm not hungry, Laura.

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:28.048
You haven't eaten all day.
Have a little soup.

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.758
I don't want any soup.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.511
Honey... here, let me help you up.

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:36.890
What? Why is it so important
that I eat soup?

01:07:36.932 --> 01:07:38.976
- What do you mean?
- What'd you put in my soup?

01:07:39.017 --> 01:07:40.936
- You put something in my soup?
- Marty...

01:07:40.936 --> 01:07:43.480
Is that it? Slip a little doozy
in Marty's soup...

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.566
Send him off to all-boy heaven?

01:07:45.607 --> 01:07:48.443
Move one of your little Bettys in,
is that what's going on?

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:51.280
- You're delirious.
- I'm not delirious,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.242
not with everything that's going on.
It's not far-fetched.

01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:57.828
Perfect time. Blame it on the polyp.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:59.621
How do I know you didn't
put something in this soup?

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:01.790
You're being ridiculous, honey.

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:05.210
Would you like me
to try the soup?

01:08:05.252 --> 01:08:07.963
Yeah... you have the soup.

01:08:15.971 --> 01:08:20.309
I'm sorry... I'm just wacked.
I'm sorry.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:27.566
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:37.743
It's good soup.

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:12.236
(ringing)

01:09:13.987 --> 01:09:16.156
Hello?

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:18.033
Yeah, just a moment.

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:28.669
Honey...
it's Dr. Berman.

01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:34.049
- Hello?
- Marty? Jerry Berman.

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:37.594
These calls go one of two ways.

01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:41.055
This one's going your way,
Marty. You're fine.

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:43.100
You should have a good life.

01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:45.102
Give Laura my love...

01:09:45.144 --> 01:09:47.062
and Marty, I gotta tell ya,
I've known you a long time,

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:50.274
you're the biggest baby
I've ever operated on. Ever.

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:52.818
I mean it. You're a wuss, Marty.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.695
Okay, bye-bye.

01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:56.113
Bye.

01:09:57.197 --> 01:09:59.158
It's okay.

01:10:09.877 --> 01:10:12.212
Marty?

01:10:12.254 --> 01:10:14.423
I love you.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.634
The scare was really good for me.

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:20.220
It made me realize
how much I love you.

01:10:20.262 --> 01:10:24.975
Lately, I've been thinking I was hiding
this dark desire from you...

01:10:25.017 --> 01:10:28.562
but, I haven't been.
Not at all.

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:32.274
It's not what I want.
I want what we have.

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:37.279
It's more important to me
than having sex with women.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.615
I only wanna be with you.

01:10:39.656 --> 01:10:42.951
Really, that's what I figured out...

01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:45.662
I just wanna have sex with you.

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:52.669
Thanks, Laura. I gotta tell you,
I feel the same way.

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:54.755
A lot of sex, Marty.

01:10:56.131 --> 01:11:00.594
A lot of sex...?
Okay... good.

01:11:00.636 --> 01:11:04.097
I wanna triple the amount
of sex that we have.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:10.103
You wanna triple the amount
of sex we have?

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:14.274
It's a lot of sex.

01:11:14.316 --> 01:11:16.068
Ow - ow, ow...!

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:25.285
Don't stop, don't stop.

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:30.415
Was that okay?

01:11:30.457 --> 01:11:33.335
You could do better.

01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:37.506
I'm ready again, Marty.
Wake up.

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:39.925
Aggh - gentle, babe...!
Gentle...!

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:42.261
Come on... up-up-up!

01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:51.353
It's playtime!

01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:58.569
(car horn tootling)

01:12:06.076 --> 01:12:07.744
Oh, shit, it's the Pembrokes.

01:12:08.787 --> 01:12:11.498
- Hey, Dave.
- Hey, Marty, how ya doin'?

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.083
- Doin' good.
- Sorry to just drop by...

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:15.043
but we were in the neighborhood.

01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:17.004
I thought you might
show us that house.

01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:20.215
Definitely. Let me tell Laura
that I'm gonna go.

01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:23.635
Bring her. I have a feeling
I'll need some company.

01:12:48.076 --> 01:12:51.747
- Marty, you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:54.541
Every bedroom has it's own balcony.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:57.544
First class windows,
everything high end...

01:12:57.586 --> 01:13:01.173
Everything.
We get the best of everything.

01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:03.258
Marty, this is a hell of a house.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.385
This kid is a real talent.

01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:07.221
Yes, he is, he's very talented.

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:12.476
He's lucky he's got
a strong partner, this was not easy...

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:14.978
I am very impressed
with this kid's work.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.482
I'm glad.
We put a lot of work into it.

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:22.611
So, do you really dislike L.A.?

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:26.990
No. Dave does.
When you stay married long enough...

01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:31.495
you have to think hard
which opinions are your own.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:34.081
Yeah, I find myself doing that.

01:13:34.122 --> 01:13:37.960
Grafting onto Marty's
likes and dislikes.

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:42.422
I hate to admit, being with Dave
has really changed me.

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:45.050
I used to be a Democrat.

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:49.805
He turned me into a Republican.
They can do that.

01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:53.976
Before Dave, I was actually
a bit of a liberal.

01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:55.978
What's this room in here?

01:13:56.019 --> 01:14:02.234
This room is gonna be...
this is the...

01:14:02.276 --> 01:14:06.155
I don't know. He's gonna be here,
we'll ask him.

01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:10.701
Evie wants to have lunch.

01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:13.245
Lunch with you and Evie?
You think that's a good idea?

01:14:13.287 --> 01:14:15.622
What are you talking about?

01:14:15.664 --> 01:14:17.749
Her husband is my only
serious silent investor...

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:20.794
and you have the sexual self-control
of a 52-year-old senator.

01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:23.505
- You tell me.
- Thank you very much, honey.

01:14:24.381 --> 01:14:28.385
Oh, damn, I got a parking ticket.
Goddamn parking ticket.

01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:30.846
Honey, calm down.
It's just a parking ticket.

01:14:30.846 --> 01:14:34.266
It's not a parking ticket.
It's God fucking with me.

01:14:34.308 --> 01:14:37.853
First, he sends parking tickets,
then drought and famine.

01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:42.900
No, he's not in either.

01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:47.196
I asked Romberg, he gave me
the "money is tight" speech.

01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:50.157
I'll figure it out.
All right...

01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:51.909
Bye.

01:14:58.582 --> 01:15:01.418
I've been thinking about it.
You think she really likes you?

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.504
Evie Pembroke?

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:05.130
Yeah, I think she likes me.

01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.966
I know this is gonna piss you off...

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:11.386
this is gonna sound bad,
but I think you should pursue it.

01:15:11.428 --> 01:15:14.056
Marty...?

01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:15.933
Are you asking me
to have sex with Evie?

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:19.478
No, I'm not ask... no.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.897
I'm asking you to do
your little pizza gag,

01:15:21.897 --> 01:15:25.192
do your little rap on her,
you know, get cozy...

01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:29.071
Excuse me, I don't have a "rap",
and I resent this.

01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:32.658
I'm just asking you to get
a litle friendly with the woman,

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:35.702
get to know her, talk her into
talking her husband...

01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:38.080
into investing in my project, okay?

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.875
It's a favor I'm asking,
to keep this house, our lifestyle,

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:45.254
I need you to go in
for one last strategic hit.

01:15:49.216 --> 01:15:50.759
What?

01:15:51.927 --> 01:15:54.096
Wasn't such a big goddamn deal
when you were chasing my sister

01:15:54.096 --> 01:15:56.515
around the Wayne Newton Suite.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.811
Laura...!

01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:04.982
These are so great,
you really are talented.

01:16:05.023 --> 01:16:08.902
Thank you.
Marty made all my shelves.

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:11.280
I love this little guy.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.700
That's my dad.
That's my father.

01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:15.450
Really?

01:16:15.492 --> 01:16:17.703
I didn't know you knew my father.

01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:21.874
Laura, I really,
really love your work.

01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:25.502
It's so... warm.

01:16:25.544 --> 01:16:26.962
Thank you.

01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:28.964
I didn't know you did women.

01:16:29.006 --> 01:16:32.593
I... don't, really...

01:16:32.634 --> 01:16:34.386
I tried a few.

01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:38.056
Looks like you have
a feel for them.

01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:40.476
Do you like it?

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:44.354
I think I figured out...
that I preferred doing men.

01:16:46.899 --> 01:16:48.817
That's a shame.

01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:53.655
Look at you...
You're blushing.

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:56.200
- Am I?
- You're bright red...

01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:57.993
I really don't think
we should be doing this.

01:16:58.035 --> 01:16:59.286
Yes, we should...

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:01.079
I really don't...

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.956
Yes. We should.

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:04.833
I thought you were against this?

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.169
Me? No... Dave is.

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:09.838
- Dave is?
- Let go.

01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:14.510
I'm the opposite of Dave.
Dave is square.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.804
I am the opposite of square.

01:17:16.845 --> 01:17:19.723
You're the opposite of square?

01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:23.936
The first night I met you,
I picked up on your energy.

01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:26.355
I've got an eye
and an ear for it.

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:28.941
I can pick 'em out in a crowd.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:33.904
Straight little wife
with a straight little life.

01:17:33.946 --> 01:17:36.740
You're so pent up, aren't you?

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:40.369
It's okay. You're about ready
to let the dam burst.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.455
I think I kinda like the dam.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:45.874
I'm not sure
I wanna see it burst.

01:17:45.874 --> 01:17:48.001
I've gotta go.

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:52.089
We'll continue this conversation
another time.

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:59.638
Hey, how you doin', man?
Listen...

01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:03.058
I'm kidding. I was joking.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.854
Hey... she looks great.
Hi, Carol.

01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:08.647
(Billy:)
I don't know what your wife did to her,

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:14.361
but she's a whole different animal.
She's on a diet, she's into sex,

01:18:14.403 --> 01:18:15.737
So things worked out, right?
Friends again?

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:18.073
No.

01:18:18.115 --> 01:18:22.619
I know why you told her.
You think you're better than me.

01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:26.206
Because you think you don't cheat
behind your wife's back...

01:18:26.248 --> 01:18:27.916
because you cheat
in front of her face,

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:31.420
you've found this high moral ground
where you can judge me from.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.755
- That's not true, Billy.
- It is true.

01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:34.256
It isn't...

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:36.717
It is, and you know it.
And you're wrong.

01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:40.554
You can be in the same bed
with your wife and be cheating on her.

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:43.515
- You're in big trouble with God.
- Don't say that.

01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:47.436
I'm gonna finish the house,
we'll sell it...

01:18:47.436 --> 01:18:49.521
You'll get your money back,
then, you know what?

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:52.691
We're done. I mean it.
We're done.

01:18:52.733 --> 01:18:54.568
Fine. I got it.

01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:59.615
I don't like you.
I don't trust you.

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:01.241
I got it.

01:19:01.283 --> 01:19:06.163
I just realized that you're not
my kinda guy.

01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:09.249
Hey - I got it.
I got it.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.710
I got it.

01:19:14.713 --> 01:19:16.256
I got it.

01:19:24.598 --> 01:19:26.517
Evie...! Hi.

01:19:28.519 --> 01:19:30.437
I was just going shopping.
You wanna join me?

01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:33.816
Shopping? No, no...

01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:37.236
I've already done my shopping.
I'm here to close a sale.

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:39.947
Close a sale?

01:19:39.988 --> 01:19:43.242
- I'm going inside.
- You're going inside?

01:19:43.283 --> 01:19:48.163
Inside, upstairs, I'm gonna wait
for you in the bedroom.

01:19:48.163 --> 01:19:49.581
Wait for me?

01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:53.001
I don't have a lotta time.
It's my Cub Scout pickup day.

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:55.254
Come on, come on...
quickly.

01:19:56.338 --> 01:19:58.465
Wait for me upstairs...?

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.140
Door's locked.

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.978
Billy? It's for you.

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:19.027
- This is Billy.
- This is Pembroke...

01:20:19.069 --> 01:20:21.029
Where's your partner?
I got a check for him.

01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:24.074
I'm in with you guys,
I just wanna go over a few things.

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:26.410
I don't know.
I think he went home.

01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:28.996
I'll head over there.
I'll talk to you soon.

01:20:29.037 --> 01:20:30.539
All right.

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:46.388
Hey...

01:20:51.143 --> 01:20:53.896
you wanna have
some real fun?

01:20:53.896 --> 01:20:55.814
More fun than this?

01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:05.073
Those are Marty's favorite ties...

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:08.118
Aw, poor Marty.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.245
To hell with Marty!

01:21:10.287 --> 01:21:12.748
I want you to tie me up.

01:21:12.789 --> 01:21:15.876
Now, push me down!
Push me hard.

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:29.348
There you go...
tied up and gagged. What's next?

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:31.350
(garbled)

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.146
The pillow...?

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:42.444
Evie, you're starting
to scare me now.

01:21:46.198 --> 01:21:47.950
Laura?

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:51.411
Laura?

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.378
- Oh, shit!
- Marty...!

01:21:59.419 --> 01:22:00.963
Are you kiddin' me?!

01:22:06.176 --> 01:22:08.929
Marty...
don't be mad.

01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:12.182
Don't be mad.
You were the one, you told me...

01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:15.727
I was, what? "The one", what?
I told you to tie her up?!

01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:20.149
You've got Dave Pembroke's wife
tied up in our bedroom!

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:22.568
Have you lost touch with reality?!

01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:26.572
Marty... you started all of this.
You.

01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:27.698
- Me...?
- Yes.

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:31.910
I said, "get chummy with her."
I didn't ask to take her hostage.

01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:33.662
Oh, my God!

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:36.790
You made me open certain doors
that I shouldn't have opened.

01:22:36.832 --> 01:22:38.876
What are you talking about?

01:22:38.917 --> 01:22:40.878
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:43.839
- This is what you wanted.
- What I wanted?

01:22:43.839 --> 01:22:47.926
I wanted you to tie up
Evie Pembroke in our bedroom?

01:22:47.968 --> 01:22:51.930
You wanted me to be...
you know!

01:22:51.972 --> 01:22:54.475
What?
I wanted you to try a few things.

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:57.478
I wanted you to fool around a little.
Is that so bad?

01:22:57.519 --> 01:23:00.481
I didn't want you to become
a walking orgasm!

01:23:00.522 --> 01:23:02.858
Jesus, you've taken
the whole thing way too far!

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.818
No, I haven't.
Don't you say that.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.987
- Yes, you have.
- Don't you say that!

01:23:09.031 --> 01:23:12.367
Listen to me. You've taken
the whole thing way too far.

01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:14.703
You're tying women up,
and you're gagging them, now.

01:23:14.703 --> 01:23:16.538
That's too far. What's next...

01:23:16.538 --> 01:23:20.000
I'm gonna come home and you'll be
performing surgery on some girl!

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:22.669
It is not like that.

01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.505
This is your fault.
I was happy...

01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:26.924
I was happy
just being your wife!

01:23:26.965 --> 01:23:31.470
Oh, Laura,
will you just calm dowm?

01:23:33.388 --> 01:23:36.225
If you had all this in you,
it was gonna come out sooner or later.

01:23:38.018 --> 01:23:40.395
Maybe, maybe not.

01:23:40.437 --> 01:23:43.732
Maybe I didn't want the dam to burst.
Ever think about that?

01:23:43.774 --> 01:23:45.359
What "dam"?
What are you talking about?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.236
You burst the dam, Marty.

01:23:47.277 --> 01:23:48.946
What fuckin' "dam"?

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:51.824
- This is all your doing.
- My doing?

01:23:51.865 --> 01:23:55.244
You tied that woman up in there.
Not me... you.

01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:12.803
- She's tied up with my Hugo Boss ties?
- She picked the ties.

01:24:12.845 --> 01:24:14.596
Oh... she has taste.
That's good to know.

01:24:14.596 --> 01:24:15.931
(doorbell rings)

01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:17.891
- Who's this?
- I don't know.

01:24:17.933 --> 01:24:19.143
Well, go find out.

01:24:22.437 --> 01:24:23.814
(gasping)

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:28.527
- Marty!
- What?

01:24:28.569 --> 01:24:30.445
It's Dave!

01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:33.282
He's here? Dave?!

01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:37.286
- Why's he here?
- I don't know.

01:24:42.374 --> 01:24:43.625
He is here.

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.753
What do we do?

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:48.547
Act natural.

01:24:49.298 --> 01:24:52.176
No... that's semi-natural.

01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:54.636
Yes... whatever...
do it over there.

01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:05.272
Hey, Dave,
how ya doin', Dave...?

01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:08.317
Hey... hey, Dave...
Hey, Dave...!

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:13.322
Hey, Dave! How, ya doin'?
Come out to the yard...

01:25:13.322 --> 01:25:15.574
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife? I don't know...

01:25:15.616 --> 01:25:18.452
You wanna go down to the corner,
get a drink, talk about the project?

01:25:18.494 --> 01:25:21.663
- No... her car's here.
- Her car's here...?

01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:23.999
- Hi, Laura.
- Hey, Dave, how ya doin'?

01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:26.376
Where's Evie?

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:27.669
She's not here...

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:29.755
No, she's not here... no.

01:25:29.796 --> 01:25:32.591
Her car's here. Any idea why
her car would be here?

01:25:32.633 --> 01:25:35.093
Her car is here?
Wow...

01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:37.471
I'm not a car person,
so I wouldn't know.

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:39.181
She's never been a car person.

01:25:39.181 --> 01:25:41.558
You're not a "car person"?

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.645
Dave, let's go in the yard,
and have a drink...

01:25:44.686 --> 01:25:47.105
I don't wanna drink, Marty,
I need to find my wife.

01:25:47.147 --> 01:25:48.690
(doorbell rings)

01:25:48.732 --> 01:25:51.193
- Maybe that's her.
- No, it's not her.

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:52.986
Honey, you don't know
that it's not her.

01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:55.030
- I don't?
- He doesn't?

01:25:55.072 --> 01:25:58.867
I don't... I couldn't know.
There's no way I'd know it's not her.

01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:02.663
But I'll check and I'll see.
I'll get the door.

01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:04.540
Go in the yard, okay, buddy?

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.375
Yeah, come in... the yard.

01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:11.588
Didi... bad time.
Laura's not here.

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.424
Marty wait,
I have to talk to Laura.

01:26:14.466 --> 01:26:16.343
I want to take her
to the sculpture sympo-see-um.

01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:17.886
I really think
it would be good for her.

01:26:17.928 --> 01:26:20.472
Laura's not here,
and I'm in the middle of something.

01:26:20.514 --> 01:26:21.890
You have to go.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.601
Her car is here, I know she's here.
What is your problem?

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:27.688
Didi, don't take this wrong...

01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:30.107
but Laura does not want
to be part of your little club.

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:31.984
My "little club"?

01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:35.612
Yes. She had a trial membership,
and we're not gonna renew.

01:26:35.654 --> 01:26:37.489
"A trial membership"?

01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:39.950
...And I have to go.

01:26:39.992 --> 01:26:41.952
It's not about you, no offense,

01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:44.746
but we're not gonna
renew the membership.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:47.207
What's the deal with Marty?

01:26:47.249 --> 01:26:50.377
We just bought
a new espresso machine,

01:26:50.419 --> 01:26:53.130
and he just had...
whoa... way too much.

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:55.215
I'm gonna say goodbye.

01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:57.968
All you guys think you know
so much about lesbians...

01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:00.596
you think you're so into lesbians,
but you're not.

01:27:00.637 --> 01:27:03.182
You are into what you wish
lesbians were...

01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:05.851
cock-hungry nyphos,
keeping themselves busy

01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:11.023
until a real man hits town.
That's not the reality.

01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:12.858
Quickly, what's the reality?
I gotta go.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.944
The reality is, that you pushed,
and you pushed,

01:27:15.986 --> 01:27:18.739
and now your wife eats pussy
better than you do.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.449
Have a nice day.

01:27:24.703 --> 01:27:27.831
Honey...?

01:27:27.873 --> 01:27:30.167
That have anything
to do with Evie?

01:27:30.209 --> 01:27:32.461
- Wasn't Evie?
- No...

01:27:32.461 --> 01:27:34.296
Someone about a "sympo-see-um".

01:27:34.338 --> 01:27:37.508
- A "sympo-see-um"?
- Yeah, a "sympo-see-um".

01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:39.551
A "sympo-see-um"?

01:27:39.593 --> 01:27:42.513
Yeah...!
Yeah, Dave...

01:27:42.554 --> 01:27:44.097
What the hell
is going on here, Marty?

01:27:44.139 --> 01:27:46.016
Let's go get a drink...

01:27:46.058 --> 01:27:48.602
I'm going stir crazy.
I gotta get out of the house...

01:27:48.644 --> 01:27:50.437
(mumbling)

01:27:50.479 --> 01:27:51.814
What's that?

01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:54.525
- Our dog...
- Sounds like Evie.

01:27:54.566 --> 01:27:56.485
It's our new dog.
A barking terrier.

01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:59.279
Is that Evie?
Evie...?

01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:01.198
Evie...!

01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:04.409
(distressed cry)

01:28:05.577 --> 01:28:07.412
Evie!

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:14.670
Holy mother of God!
Evie...!

01:28:14.711 --> 01:28:15.963
Dave, I had nothing
to do with this.

01:28:16.004 --> 01:28:17.840
I came in, saw the same thing,
and went, "Aggh!"

01:28:17.881 --> 01:28:20.634
Son of a bitch!
You pervert!

01:28:20.676 --> 01:28:22.177
(Evie squealing)

01:28:22.219 --> 01:28:24.888
You're fucking dead!

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:27.224
No, no, Dave...!

01:28:27.266 --> 01:28:30.394
You are a dead man, Marty!

01:28:47.035 --> 01:28:49.329
Was it worth it, Marty?
'Cause you are gonna die!

01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:54.877
Just stop it!
Are you all okay, Marty?

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:57.045
No, I'm not okay!
Do I look okay to you?

01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:01.633
You are a dead man, Marty.

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:03.886
Don't hurt him.
No, no, it was me...

01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:06.221
I tied Evie up!

01:29:06.221 --> 01:29:08.849
- You tied my wife up?
- Yes...!

01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:11.226
She didn't wanna do it!

01:29:11.268 --> 01:29:12.728
It was me!

01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:14.646
I didn't want to,
she seduced me.

01:29:14.688 --> 01:29:16.648
I swear, I swear.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.026
Laura didn't wanna tie her up.
Evie seduced her.

01:29:19.067 --> 01:29:21.445
It's true, Dave.
It's true.

01:29:21.487 --> 01:29:23.489
I wasn't gonna sleep
with any more women.

01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:25.157
At least, not for a while, anyway.

01:29:25.199 --> 01:29:26.867
Okay, good. Conversation
for another time...?

01:29:26.909 --> 01:29:29.036
Dave... listen...

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:33.415
I'm a stand-up guy.
I would not tie your wife up.

01:29:33.415 --> 01:29:34.875
I wouldn't.
I've known you a long time...

01:29:34.917 --> 01:29:38.212
I wouldn't do anything
to jeopardize our relationship.

01:29:38.253 --> 01:29:40.088
What the hell is your deal, man?

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.382
Married to some weird L.A. Sex freak?
Is that your thing?

01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:45.052
Dave... don't call Laura names.

01:29:45.093 --> 01:29:47.012
What should I call her?
That's what she is...

01:29:47.054 --> 01:29:49.056
she's got my wife tied
and gagged up there.

01:29:49.097 --> 01:29:50.891
What should I call her?

01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:52.935
You're married to a deviate
L.A. Sex twat.

01:29:52.976 --> 01:29:58.148
Dave, screw you.
Don't call Laura names. I mean it.

01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.608
Screw you, Marty!

01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:02.486
You're way overreacting,
I'm the one that should be pissed off.

01:30:02.528 --> 01:30:04.112
You're overreacting, "Sunscreen".

01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:07.783
I mean it. Take your Orange County
weatherbeaten ass...

01:30:07.825 --> 01:30:11.203
go get your drip-dry, grisly,
whacked-out excuse for a wife,

01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:13.372
and get the hell out of here.
I'm serious.

01:30:13.413 --> 01:30:16.834
I mean it. You're a Republican.
This is a No Republican Zone.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:19.920
You're messin' up
my property values.

01:30:19.962 --> 01:30:21.088
Yeah.

01:30:22.673 --> 01:30:24.591
Take off, Dave.

01:30:26.635 --> 01:30:29.847
Aw, the hell with it.
To hell with you...

01:30:29.888 --> 01:30:31.306
and to hell with her.

01:30:31.348 --> 01:30:32.975
The hell with you!

01:30:33.016 --> 01:30:35.269
Okay, Laura, he gets the message.

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.314
Don't be surprised when you get
a bill for cleaning and pressing

01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:41.859
four Hugo Boss ties,
okay, Pembroke?

01:30:45.487 --> 01:30:48.615
Oh, good, kick my gate, Millionaire.
That'll help.

01:30:51.702 --> 01:30:53.620
Shit... that didn't go well.

01:30:55.205 --> 01:30:57.040
It was nice
what you did, though. Thanks.

01:30:57.082 --> 01:31:00.377
You're welcome.
I gotta pay the mortgage, though.

01:31:03.881 --> 01:31:06.216
I think we're this close to violating
a federal law of some kind.

01:31:06.258 --> 01:31:08.010
Go upstairs, and untie Evie.

01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:09.720
No way...
I'm not gonna untie her.

01:31:09.761 --> 01:31:13.974
You got a woman tied
and gagged upstairs. Go and untie her.

01:31:14.016 --> 01:31:16.351
No, I'm not gonna untie her.

01:31:16.393 --> 01:31:17.769
Hey... you tied her up...

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:19.938
Marty Barnes...
you go untie her yourself.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.899
No, you tied her up,
you go untie her.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.151
Go untie her, Marty.

01:31:24.193 --> 01:31:26.320
Now!

01:31:27.863 --> 01:31:29.948
Fine. I'll untie her.

01:31:36.955 --> 01:31:39.458
It's not that big a deal to me.
I'm going.

01:31:45.047 --> 01:31:47.216
Hi... Evie, hi.

01:31:52.179 --> 01:31:54.807
Before I untie you,
while I have your attention...

01:31:54.848 --> 01:31:57.476
I just wanted
to take a minute and say...

01:31:58.894 --> 01:32:00.854
I know this is gonna be
really rough on you and Dave.

01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:06.151
It's probably gonna end up
in divorce for the two of you.

01:32:07.069 --> 01:32:09.446
That's really sad...

01:32:09.988 --> 01:32:12.908
Okay, what I'm thinking is...

01:32:12.908 --> 01:32:15.786
you're gonna have
half of Dave's money, right?

01:32:15.828 --> 01:32:20.082
I gotta really good investment for you.
A project I'm working on...

01:32:27.089 --> 01:32:29.716
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, honey.

01:32:29.758 --> 01:32:31.260
Like my hair?

01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:33.387
You kiddin'?
I'm crazy about it.

01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:36.306
- Hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starved.

01:32:36.348 --> 01:32:38.267
Can we go someplace nice?

01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:39.476
Whatever you want.

01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:44.398
Hi, I'm Henry.

01:32:44.439 --> 01:32:46.275
I'm Marty.
Nice to meet you.

01:32:46.275 --> 01:32:48.694
Nice to meet you.
You like her new hair?

01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:50.237
Her hair?

01:32:50.445 --> 01:32:51.989
Yeah, I like her hair.

01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:53.198
Thanks.

01:32:54.992 --> 01:32:56.827
- Nice meeting you, Henry.
- Bye.

01:32:58.245 --> 01:33:00.122
You like this restaurant,
don't you?

01:33:00.164 --> 01:33:02.541
- Always did.
- I know you did.

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:05.669
Know what? We're gonna start
coming here again.

01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:08.630
That'd be nice. Thanks.

01:33:10.632 --> 01:33:12.551
What did you think of Henry?

01:33:13.635 --> 01:33:16.597
The guy at your salon?
Seemed like a nice guy.

01:33:16.638 --> 01:33:18.390
You think he's openly bisexual?

01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:21.852
What do you mean,
"openly bisexual"?

01:33:21.894 --> 01:33:23.645
Well, If I went
in there this afternoon...

01:33:23.645 --> 01:33:24.980
and went, "Hey...

01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:28.317
is anybody in here bisexual?"
What do you think ol' Henry would do?

01:33:28.317 --> 01:33:30.360
What's your point, Laura?

01:33:30.402 --> 01:33:32.654
I think it would be
good for you.

01:33:32.696 --> 01:33:34.364
Good for me?

01:33:36.658 --> 01:33:38.535
You're messin' with me, right?

01:33:38.577 --> 01:33:40.787
Yeah.

01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:43.499
I might be.
