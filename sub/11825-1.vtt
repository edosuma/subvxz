04:16.587 --> 04:18.288
Aah!

04:45.650 --> 04:47.851
Three minutes.
The girl. Now!

04:56.828 --> 04:58.362
Let's hurry a bit,
shall we?

05:00.098 --> 05:02.899
Come on!

05:02.900 --> 05:04.368
Faster, faster!

05:24.722 --> 05:25.789
Read!

05:25.790 --> 05:27.891
Or we're all
gonna die!

05:32.363 --> 05:33.797
Uhh...

05:52.984 --> 05:55.919
Aah!

05:57.188 --> 05:58.922
Aah!

06:01.893 --> 06:02.926
No! Come back

06:08.066 --> 06:11.435
Aah!

06:41.766 --> 06:43.433
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

06:43.434 --> 06:46.269
<i>Are you two
sitting comfortably?</i>

06:46.270 --> 06:49.573
<i>Good. Now. Gentlemen.</i>

06:49.574 --> 06:52.342
Do you see
these file folders?

06:52.343 --> 06:54.678
The ones with your names
on them?

06:54.679 --> 06:57.748
Can you guess
what's in these file folders?

06:57.749 --> 06:59.149
I'll give you
a hint.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.951
Discipline
reports.

07:00.952 --> 07:02.085
Lots of them.

07:02.086 --> 07:05.122
And some wonderful
artwork as well.

07:05.123 --> 07:05.989
This is...?

07:07.358 --> 07:09.393
Spider
with human head?

07:09.394 --> 07:11.561
I'm sorry. Spider?
With human head.

07:11.562 --> 07:15.532
Yeah. He eats dogs
and cats and rabbits.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.034
Does he?

07:17.035 --> 07:19.036
Sean thought him up.
You see, sir,

07:19.037 --> 07:20.837
we kinda have
this monster club, okay?

07:20.838 --> 07:23.340
And we draw those pictures to put
on our clubhouse walls.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.108
Correction,
Mr. Crenshaw.

07:25.109 --> 07:28.378
You draw pictures
during Mrs. Carlson's science class

07:28.379 --> 07:30.547
when you're supposed
to be paying attention.

07:30.548 --> 07:32.149
Wait. I just want
to say one thing.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.851
I mean, Ms. Carlson's
a nice teacher and all,

07:34.852 --> 07:37.154
but she's boring and
has an odd-shaped head.

07:37.155 --> 07:39.189
That's why Sean and the guys
call her "Meow Mix,"

07:39.190 --> 07:41.191
'cause her head's
shaped like a cat head.

07:41.192 --> 07:43.527
But I don't, sir,
'cause-- how rude.

07:46.998 --> 07:47.531
Boys...

07:49.167 --> 07:50.667
I hear you.

07:51.903 --> 07:53.537
I was a kid once.

07:53.538 --> 07:55.672
I thought monsters
were cool.

07:55.673 --> 07:57.607
And maybe, well--
well, gosh...

07:57.608 --> 07:58.942
maybe I'm
just a big kid,

07:58.943 --> 08:00.043
because, Sean, Patrick...

08:01.813 --> 08:03.780
...I think science

08:03.781 --> 08:04.548
is cool.

08:06.017 --> 08:07.851
I dig it, man.

08:10.355 --> 08:11.655
Now, I'm sure
both of you know

08:11.656 --> 08:13.190
a great deal
about monsters,

08:13.191 --> 08:15.058
but that's not the issue here.
The issue is...

08:16.461 --> 08:18.862
...science is real.

08:18.863 --> 08:20.564
Monsters are not.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.034
We don't
know that, sir.

08:28.039 --> 08:29.806
God, can you believe
Mr. Metzger?

08:29.807 --> 08:32.676
Tell me about it. He touched me
and patted my shoulders and stuff.

08:32.677 --> 08:33.876
The guy was fully
homo-ing out.

08:33.878 --> 08:35.245
I smell like the '40s.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.780
I mean, when they send you to school,
why don't they

08:36.780 --> 08:39.182
tell you about the homos and
people with cat heads--

08:39.183 --> 08:40.082
Ooh!
Oh!

08:46.391 --> 08:47.591
Sorry,
Mrs. Carlson.

08:51.462 --> 08:52.662
Meow. Meow.

08:52.663 --> 08:53.897
She's married, Sean.

08:53.898 --> 08:56.299
Oh, my God! Some guy
kisses her at night?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.735
I mean, a priest said,
"I now pronounce you man and wife,"

08:58.736 --> 08:59.903
and it was
okay with him?

08:59.904 --> 09:00.604
Hey.
Where's Fat Kid?

09:04.909 --> 09:07.077
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to our show.

09:07.078 --> 09:09.680
What makes Fat Kid fat?

09:09.681 --> 09:10.781
Fat kid?

09:10.782 --> 09:12.382
Get out of here,
E.J.

09:12.383 --> 09:13.784
"Get out of here, E.J."
Nope.

09:13.785 --> 09:15.419
Not a good answer.
Doesn't make any sense.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.320
Let's go to our man on the street. Derek.
Hi. I'm Derek,

09:17.321 --> 09:19.389
and I'm in the street
where Fat Kid is blocking traffic.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.624
Fat Kid, can't you
stop eating?

09:24.529 --> 09:26.630
Look, I have
a glandular problem, okay?

09:26.631 --> 09:29.633
At least I don't have a...
stupidity problem.

09:29.634 --> 09:31.468
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

09:31.469 --> 09:32.469
My name's Horace!

09:32.470 --> 09:33.470
Horace.

09:33.471 --> 09:34.137
Whore-ass.

09:39.444 --> 09:41.578
Oops.
I tore it.

09:41.579 --> 09:44.081
I guess I must have
a stupidity problem.

09:44.082 --> 09:46.750
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

09:46.751 --> 09:49.186
I said,
"You're an asshole."

10:08.940 --> 10:10.007
Hey, Rudy.

10:11.642 --> 10:12.509
E.J.

10:14.145 --> 10:15.012
See you met
my friend Horace.

10:16.614 --> 10:18.015
You okay?

10:19.317 --> 10:20.517
Rudy, I, uh--
Shh!

10:22.487 --> 10:24.054
You dropped
your candy bar, E.J.

10:24.055 --> 10:25.389
It's his.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.024
It's your now.

10:29.494 --> 10:31.395
Rudy-- Eat.

10:31.396 --> 10:33.930
Rudy, I'm not gonna--
Eat up!

10:33.931 --> 10:35.032
And we'll
call it a day.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.556
Look, Patrick,
I told you before,

10:59.557 --> 11:01.692
Wolfman cannot drive a car.
Yes, he can.

11:01.693 --> 11:03.527
No, he can't!
Yes, he can.

11:03.528 --> 11:05.696
All I'm saying is,
Sean, he could if he had to.

11:05.697 --> 11:07.230
He could not. You're
being such a dork!

11:07.231 --> 11:08.699
I know you are, but what am I?
A dork.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.866
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?</i>

11:09.867 --> 11:11.068
Oh, great. A feeb.
A dork.

11:11.069 --> 11:12.636
I know you are,
but what am I?
A dork.

11:12.637 --> 11:14.438
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?
Infinity! Look,</i>

11:14.439 --> 11:17.074
Wolfman doesn't go to work.
He's not, like, a guy.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.375
What are you
talkin' about?

11:18.376 --> 11:20.143
He walks around.
He wears pants.

11:20.144 --> 11:23.380
He had to wear pants
'cause those movies
were made in the '40s.

11:23.381 --> 11:25.382
He had to wear 'em
so you wouldn't see his--

11:25.383 --> 11:26.083
wolf dork.

11:27.885 --> 11:28.585
Wolf dork?

11:31.356 --> 11:33.056
You guys!

11:35.059 --> 11:37.227
I saw him.
He was watching us.

11:37.228 --> 11:38.228
Who?

11:38.229 --> 11:39.596
Scary German Guy.

11:41.899 --> 11:43.600
Sean, he give me
the creeps.

11:43.601 --> 11:45.569
Oh, he's just
a dude on welfare.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.137
Maybe he's
a German spy.

11:47.138 --> 11:49.339
Oh, good one.
We're not at war
with Germany anymore.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.208
We're at war
with Vietnam.

11:51.209 --> 11:52.209
What?

11:52.210 --> 11:53.377
<i>It's in Rambo.</i>

11:53.378 --> 11:55.645
You guys missed it!
Oh! Fat Kid!

11:55.646 --> 11:57.080
Rudy saved my life!

11:57.081 --> 11:59.416
Do you think we could
talk him into joining
the Monster Club?

11:59.417 --> 12:01.084
Can we?

12:01.085 --> 12:01.618
Huddle.
Huddle.

12:03.087 --> 12:04.821
Sean, he's
in junior high.

12:04.822 --> 12:06.523
I hear he killed his dad.

12:06.524 --> 12:08.625
Get out of here,
Phoebe the Feeb!

12:13.598 --> 12:16.633
Okay, you guys.
We should let him in
on one condition.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.636
Monster test.

12:28.746 --> 12:30.947
You guys!
I saw Scary--

12:30.948 --> 12:31.982
I saw him!

12:31.983 --> 12:33.817
I saw Scary German Guy!

12:33.818 --> 12:34.651
He was watching!

12:37.855 --> 12:39.122
<i>I'm depressed.</i>

12:39.123 --> 12:40.557
What for?
What do you mean,
what for?

12:40.558 --> 12:42.125
I'm flyin'
a World War II bomber

12:42.126 --> 12:43.727
with wooden crates in it
and dead bodies.

12:43.728 --> 12:44.861
I should have a party?

12:44.862 --> 12:47.464
Do they complain?
Do they get airsick?

12:47.465 --> 12:49.166
Do they ask for more
of the little almond
things?

12:50.535 --> 12:51.168
You're right.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.538
This is a great job.
I'm really happy.

13:02.647 --> 13:03.747
I thought they were dead.

13:03.748 --> 13:04.681
They are.

13:07.719 --> 13:08.685
I'm goin' to, uh...

13:10.822 --> 13:12.189
I'm gonna
check it out.

13:13.491 --> 13:15.192
Okay. Good.

13:16.494 --> 13:17.661
You do that.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.698
I'll stay here and
make spooky sounds.

13:40.251 --> 13:41.418
Aah!

13:45.189 --> 13:46.690
Come on.

13:46.691 --> 13:47.691
Come on.

13:47.692 --> 13:49.292
Come on.
Where are you,

13:49.293 --> 13:51.862
you son of a bitch?

13:59.904 --> 14:00.437
Oh...

14:17.989 --> 14:18.922
Uhh!

14:57.929 --> 14:59.429
Two ways to kill
a vampire.

14:59.430 --> 15:00.931
Good one, Fat Kid.
Excellent question.

15:00.932 --> 15:01.932
Uh, stake through the heart.

15:01.933 --> 15:03.200
Right.
What else?

15:03.201 --> 15:04.401
Oh, real good.

15:04.402 --> 15:05.602
Eugene.
I wasn't talking.

15:05.603 --> 15:07.738
Get him in a muzzle,
will ya?
It was Pete.

15:07.739 --> 15:09.272
You guys meet up here
a lot, or, uh...

15:09.273 --> 15:10.440
Every day.

15:10.441 --> 15:11.441
Do we meet up here a lot?

15:11.442 --> 15:12.843
Eugene!
Man!

15:12.844 --> 15:14.378
Eugene, make
Pete shut up.

15:14.379 --> 15:16.313
Do you really think
that was a good question?

15:16.314 --> 15:19.249
Rudy!
Are you gonna listen or
look out the window?

15:19.250 --> 15:20.884
I told you he didn't want
to be in the club.

15:20.885 --> 15:21.885
Lighten up, Patrick.

15:21.886 --> 15:23.420
No way!

15:23.421 --> 15:24.788
Hey, we're tryin'
to do the test
here, you know.

15:24.789 --> 15:25.956
You're gonna
piss him off.

15:25.957 --> 15:27.057
I'm beginnin'
to like this club.

15:27.058 --> 15:29.960
Rudy! Come on.
It's a monster test.

15:29.961 --> 15:30.994
It's important. Okay?

15:34.799 --> 15:36.533
Second way
to kill a vampire.

15:38.636 --> 15:41.304
Mmm... I give up.

15:41.305 --> 15:42.372
Daylight.

15:42.373 --> 15:44.141
Sunlight.
Ha ha ha!
Fat Kid,

15:44.142 --> 15:46.209
what other kind
of light is there
durin' the day?

15:46.210 --> 15:48.378
Go away, Pete!
Okay, question two.

15:48.379 --> 15:51.748
Is Frankenstein
the name of the monster
or the guy who made him?

15:51.749 --> 15:53.216
The guy.
Right.

15:56.487 --> 15:57.554
Can't you read?

15:57.555 --> 15:59.656
Mom said you have to let me
in the club,

15:59.657 --> 16:01.792
or else it's prescruption.

16:01.793 --> 16:03.860
That's discrimination,
jerkoid.

16:03.861 --> 16:06.596
"Prescription" is drugs,
which you're on if you
think you're gettin' up here.

16:06.597 --> 16:08.432
Come on, Sean!
I know about monsters.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.801
Come on! Let me in the club!
Two ways to kill a werewolf.

16:10.802 --> 16:11.802
Silver bullet?

16:11.803 --> 16:13.303
And?

16:13.304 --> 16:15.172
That's it. Shoot him
with a sliver bullet.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.373
Nope. Sorry, Rudy.

16:16.374 --> 16:17.441
Ha ha!

16:17.442 --> 16:18.075
Okay, so, what's
the other way?

16:20.144 --> 16:21.144
What?

16:21.145 --> 16:22.346
Second way
to kill a werewolf?

16:22.347 --> 16:24.281
Um...
Car crash?

16:24.282 --> 16:25.582
Accident
with power tools?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.784
Old age?
Falling out a window.

16:27.785 --> 16:30.654
Onto a bomb!
Sean! Phoebe! Dinner!

16:30.655 --> 16:31.588
Oops. Gotta go.

16:33.358 --> 16:35.592
Wait. Am I in or what?

16:38.363 --> 16:39.363
I mean it, spaz.

16:39.364 --> 16:41.198
You gotta
stop it.

16:41.199 --> 16:42.933
Uh, uh, uh, uh!

16:42.934 --> 16:45.202
Wash up
for dinner,
guys.

16:45.203 --> 16:47.704
Boring guy, boring guy,
boring guy, boring guy.

16:47.705 --> 16:48.705
What's this, Mom?

16:48.706 --> 16:50.707
Huh? Oh, I got that
for you today

16:50.708 --> 16:52.476
at Jane Burgess'
garage sale.

16:52.477 --> 16:53.643
Says it's
from that old house

16:53.644 --> 16:55.045
up on Shadowbrook Road.

16:55.046 --> 16:58.015
Holy shit! Uh, sor-- cow.
Um, I'm sorry.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.182
Mom, do you know
who wrote this book?

16:59.183 --> 17:01.485
Yeah. It's, what,
Van Helsing something.

17:01.486 --> 17:03.620
Now, he's the one
that fights Godzilla.
Right?

17:03.621 --> 17:04.954
Dracula, Mom.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.223
Well, then which
is the really tall one?

17:06.223 --> 17:08.191
That's Godzilla.

17:08.192 --> 17:10.292
My God!
Abraham Van Helsing.

17:10.294 --> 17:11.127
This is great!

17:14.398 --> 17:15.132
This is German.

17:36.587 --> 17:37.654
Let it begin.

17:57.275 --> 17:58.542
Hey, slick.

17:58.543 --> 17:59.176
Busy day?

18:02.780 --> 18:03.680
Not really.

18:04.949 --> 18:06.583
Shoot any crooks today?
Afraid not.

18:06.584 --> 18:08.819
But I still may
if you don't
wash up for dinner.

18:09.954 --> 18:11.788
What's
on your mind?

18:11.789 --> 18:13.857
Well, Dad, uh, some
of the guys and me

18:13.858 --> 18:17.060
<i>were maybe gonna go see
Groundhog Day Part 12 tonight,
only if it's okay with you.</i>

18:17.061 --> 18:18.061
Is it? Please?

18:18.062 --> 18:19.129
Oh, we got
a problem.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.797
No way!
Yes, way.

18:20.798 --> 18:22.499
I gotta go out
with your mother
tonight.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.067
You got a certain
5-year-old sister

18:24.068 --> 18:25.268
who needs baby-sitting.
Oh, come on, Dad!

18:25.269 --> 18:27.270
I've waited all year
to see this movie!

18:27.271 --> 18:30.040
Pal, it's only a movie.
Look, tomorrow night,

18:30.041 --> 18:31.408
<i>you and I'll go see
Groundhog Day.</i>

18:31.409 --> 18:33.276
I'll get home
early.

18:33.277 --> 18:35.612
Tomorrow night?
That'll be too late!

18:35.613 --> 18:37.814
The guys will blab
the entire plot!

18:37.815 --> 18:40.150
What?
Did I hear "plot"?

18:40.151 --> 18:42.219
Sean, it is a guy
with an ax.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.321
Anyway, I thought
they killed him
in the last one.

18:44.322 --> 18:46.823
They did.
And he returns
from his grave.

18:46.824 --> 18:47.958
Returns
from the grave?

18:47.959 --> 18:50.827
Sean, he always
returns from the grave.

18:50.828 --> 18:52.596
If they blew him up,
put his head in a blender,

18:52.597 --> 18:54.031
and mailed the rest
of the pieces to Norway,

18:54.032 --> 18:56.233
he would still
return from the grave.
That was part seven.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.302
You want to know
what the plot is?

18:59.303 --> 19:01.138
The plot separates you
from my five bucks.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.539
I want to see
a stupid movie.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.474
Well, you can't.
You're baby-sitting.

19:04.475 --> 19:07.310
Fine. Can I have
five bucks anyway?

19:07.311 --> 19:08.679
Absolutely.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.514
So, where you two
goin' tonight?

19:10.515 --> 19:12.015
Marriage counselor.

19:12.016 --> 19:13.016
Again?

19:13.017 --> 19:14.251
I thought
you quit smoking.

19:15.820 --> 19:16.753
Sean.

19:19.524 --> 19:23.026
Son, I love you dearly,
but do me a favor.

19:23.027 --> 19:24.161
Put your basic lid
on it.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.264
Now, get
outta here.

19:30.535 --> 19:31.668
Hello. Yeah?

19:31.669 --> 19:33.170
Officer, please!
Lock me up!

19:33.171 --> 19:35.238
Lock--
Yeah. I'm a werewolf!
I'm a werewolf!

19:35.239 --> 19:36.707
Please. Please.
Hey, Del.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.275
I know it sounds
crazy, but...
Bad news.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.785
Listen, I gotta
go downtown.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.289
Can you reschedule
that appointment?

19:54.058 --> 19:55.292
Honey, I'm a cop,
okay?

19:56.561 --> 19:57.794
You knew that
when you bought
the package.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.031
Look.
It's important.

20:01.032 --> 20:02.366
I'm important.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.667
I love you.

20:03.668 --> 20:05.902
Prove it.

20:05.903 --> 20:07.304
I'll see you
in a few hours.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.008
Just for a night!

20:11.009 --> 20:12.142
You see,
it's a full moon!

20:12.143 --> 20:13.443
And I'm a werewolf!
Take it easy.

20:13.444 --> 20:15.512
You don't understand!
You gotta lock me up!

20:15.513 --> 20:16.913
You gotta put me
in a cage!

20:16.914 --> 20:19.349
Buddy,
I'd like nothin' better!
Hold onto your pants!

20:19.350 --> 20:22.019
Oh, God! You
don't understand!
You've gotta-- Oh!

20:22.020 --> 20:24.087
Anything you say,
fella.

20:24.088 --> 20:25.589
Put the cuffs on him.

20:25.590 --> 20:28.492
I got it.
All right.
I got him now.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.593
Aah!

20:29.594 --> 20:31.161
Jesus Christ!
We need some backup!

20:34.832 --> 20:36.166
Bon voyage!

20:44.075 --> 20:45.175
Lock me up!

20:50.448 --> 20:52.449
So, let me
get this straight.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.550
You tellin' me
there was

20:53.551 --> 20:55.786
this 2,000-year-old
mummy here, right?

20:55.787 --> 20:57.788
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.690
Well, now he's not
here. He's gone.
Vanished. History.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.291
Yes, sir.

21:01.292 --> 21:02.859
And you're sayin'
you didn't hear anybody

21:02.860 --> 21:04.828
come in here or leave.
Is that right?

21:04.829 --> 21:06.396
Can you hear me now?
Hello?

21:06.397 --> 21:08.699
I can
hear you fine.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.267
So, nobody
took the mummy.

21:10.268 --> 21:11.968
I would've heard them.

21:11.969 --> 21:13.704
Of course he would've.
What a stupid question.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.540
Did you take him?

21:16.541 --> 21:17.607
No, sir!

21:17.608 --> 21:18.642
Just a shot.

21:18.643 --> 21:20.444
That's it, Del.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.045
This case is
too hard, man.

21:22.046 --> 21:23.714
Let's be firemen
instead.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.949
I'm glad you're gettin'
major laughs
out of this, Rich.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.252
The problem is,
2,000-year-old dead guys

21:29.253 --> 21:31.221
do not get up
and walk away
by themself.

21:51.442 --> 21:52.809
<i>Accident patrol,</i>

21:52.810 --> 21:54.511
<i>uh, request confirmation.</i>

21:54.512 --> 21:57.748
<i>You have the 915-H
officer-involved shooting
en route?</i>

22:26.878 --> 22:28.645
Aah!

22:28.646 --> 22:33.216
<i>Aah!</i>

22:33.217 --> 22:34.885
<i>My God!
You scared me!</i>

22:34.886 --> 22:36.119
<i>Where are Steve
and Judy?</i>

22:36.120 --> 22:37.554
<i>I thought
they were with you.</i>

22:41.559 --> 22:42.959
<i>Not funny.</i>

22:42.960 --> 22:45.062
<i>Well, something
funny's...</i>

22:45.063 --> 22:46.063
What did I miss?

22:46.064 --> 22:47.798
<i>Judy? Steve?</i>

22:50.401 --> 22:51.802
<i>Hey!</i>

22:51.803 --> 22:54.137
<i>Oh, sheriff.
You scared us.</i>

22:54.138 --> 22:55.272
<i>Never mind about that.</i>

23:01.079 --> 23:02.079
This is
the best part.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.413
<i>Judy!</i>

23:03.414 --> 23:04.581
<i>No!</i>

23:04.582 --> 23:05.582
Lieutenant,
you wanna come over

23:05.583 --> 23:06.850
and take a look at this?

23:06.851 --> 23:08.318
<i>Dispatch, Unit 7.</i>

23:09.420 --> 23:11.588
<i>Unit 7,
come in, please.</i>

23:11.589 --> 23:13.256
<i>Please copy.</i>

23:13.257 --> 23:15.025
Wonderful. Great!
Just what I need.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.426
<i>Come again? You're--
What?</i>

23:16.427 --> 23:18.061
<i>Uh, request,
uh, cadaver--</i>

23:18.062 --> 23:21.098
I can't hear you!
No, no, no!
I said "missing"!

23:21.099 --> 23:23.333
The body's missing!
It's the second one
tonight.

23:23.334 --> 23:25.268
<i>Confirmed. That
makes two tonight,
right, Lieutenant?</i>

23:25.269 --> 23:26.837
<i>Ha, ha.
That's very funny.</i>

23:26.838 --> 23:28.672
<i>And you want
to shut up about it?</i>

25:13.211 --> 25:14.444
It's been so long.

25:22.387 --> 25:23.954
So very long.

25:50.415 --> 25:51.481
Wake up,
old friend.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.485
It is our time.

26:22.947 --> 26:25.515
Long... time...

26:26.918 --> 26:28.518
...Master.

26:47.138 --> 26:50.707
And you put the candle
next to your bed
like this.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.243
Your mom did this
when you were a little girl?

26:53.244 --> 26:54.277
Uh-huh.

26:54.278 --> 26:55.812
It means
"I love you."

26:55.813 --> 26:58.081
And as long
as it's here, nothing
bad can happen.

26:58.082 --> 27:01.551
Sean says
when it lightnings,
monsters come.

27:01.552 --> 27:04.154
Oh, he's just trying
to scare you, honey.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.822
Will lightning
hit the house?

27:05.823 --> 27:06.957
No.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.558
The candle
keeps it away?

27:10.061 --> 27:11.028
That's right.

27:12.663 --> 27:14.264
Say goodnight
to Scraps.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.599
Goodnight, Scraps.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.234
Good night, Emily.
Mwah.

27:17.235 --> 27:18.568
Good night,
sweetheart.

27:20.171 --> 27:22.072
Are you gonna
yell at him?

27:24.842 --> 27:27.044
Honey...
I love your father.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.979
What?

27:28.980 --> 27:30.514
I mean Sean,

27:30.515 --> 27:32.082
for scaring me.

27:33.217 --> 27:34.851
Of course you did.

27:34.852 --> 27:36.853
I'll talk to him
about it, sweetheart.

27:36.854 --> 27:38.088
Sweet dreams.

27:44.595 --> 27:45.796
You're thinkin'
about your job,

27:45.797 --> 27:46.963
isn't that right?

27:46.964 --> 27:48.932
I can see it
in your eyes, Del.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.468
Yeah! I'm glad you can
see it in my eyes,

27:51.469 --> 27:53.303
'cause for a minute there
I thought I had you fooled.

27:53.304 --> 27:54.304
Come on, this isn't--
No, come on!

27:54.305 --> 27:56.373
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes!

27:56.374 --> 27:57.874
I'll think
about stuff,
and you can tell me

27:57.875 --> 27:59.209
when I'm
thinking correctly!

27:59.210 --> 28:00.210
Keep your
voice down.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.445
I don't want
the children--

28:01.446 --> 28:03.180
I had a lousy night,
all right?

28:03.181 --> 28:04.981
Every night
I have a lousy night.

28:04.982 --> 28:08.151
I'm sorry it's such
a pain in the ass for you
with my stupid little job!

28:08.152 --> 28:09.720
I am trying to explain--

28:09.721 --> 28:12.889
Some guy steals
a priceless Egyptian mummy...

28:12.890 --> 28:14.658
That happens every day.
Skip that.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.360
Then I get a call
from some nutcase

28:16.361 --> 28:17.928
who's shouting
he's a werewolf!

28:17.929 --> 28:19.162
Huh? You like that?

28:19.163 --> 28:21.198
What do they do?
They blow him away

28:21.199 --> 28:22.632
right there
in the police station!

28:22.633 --> 28:25.869
Wait a minute!
There is more to this!

28:31.909 --> 28:33.477
...marriage counseling!
For what?

29:08.312 --> 29:09.446
Wha?

29:09.447 --> 29:11.982
There's a monster
in my closet.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.454
Damn, son, look!

29:17.455 --> 29:19.456
All of these monsters!

29:19.457 --> 29:21.124
Come on,
all of you monsters,
outta here!

29:21.125 --> 29:23.560
Everyone,
out of this room!
Come-- Ahh, ahh!

29:23.561 --> 29:26.830
You, on the bed.
Come on. Out. Out.
Take a hike.

29:26.831 --> 29:27.497
There he goes.

29:30.134 --> 29:31.001
You see
any more monsters?

29:36.641 --> 29:37.507
In the closet?

29:38.976 --> 29:40.977
Sure. We can go
into the closet.

29:40.978 --> 29:42.012
We can do that.

29:44.148 --> 29:46.016
Okay, monsters!

29:47.985 --> 29:49.786
Whoo!

29:49.787 --> 29:52.322
Look at that big,
scary monster!

29:52.323 --> 29:53.523
Ooh!

29:55.326 --> 29:57.494
Listen. You are
not gonna sleep

29:57.495 --> 29:58.628
with your mother
and me tonight,

29:58.629 --> 29:59.796
so you can
forget it.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.264
And keep this up,

30:01.265 --> 30:03.567
and you're not gonna look
at those monster magazines.

30:03.568 --> 30:04.534
Understand?

30:10.074 --> 30:11.541
Uhh?

30:21.019 --> 30:22.419
Okay.
We're all here.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.687
What's
the deal?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.655
Yeah.
What the hell's
Monster Squad?

30:25.656 --> 30:27.024
It's us.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.759
We're
the Monster
Squad.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.793
Since when?

30:29.794 --> 30:30.861
Since now!

30:30.862 --> 30:32.863
What's a "squad"?

30:32.864 --> 30:34.064
<i>It's like
Miami Vice, I think.</i>

30:35.400 --> 30:37.534
Look. I think
there's monsters.

30:37.535 --> 30:38.702
Like, real ones.

30:38.703 --> 30:40.370
I heard my dad talking
on the telephone

30:40.371 --> 30:41.905
to a guy down
at the police station.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.274
There was a guy screaming
he was a werewolf.

30:44.275 --> 30:47.344
And they shot him.
And the body disappeared
from the coroner van.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.212
And the coroner guy
was dead.

30:49.213 --> 30:52.315
So what? He got shot,
and the werewolf
took his body?

30:52.316 --> 30:55.819
<i>No, you pinhead!
He was a werewolf!
Maybe.</i>

30:55.820 --> 30:56.953
But if they shot him...

30:56.954 --> 30:58.255
They must've been
regular bullets,

30:58.256 --> 31:00.057
not silver ones.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.025
Look, I know
this will sound
pretty stupid,

31:02.026 --> 31:04.828
but a mummy disappeared
from the museum tonight.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.097
Mummy came
in my house.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.068
And, guys...

31:11.069 --> 31:12.602
Dracula might
be here, too.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.306
Aw, man,
Fat Kid farted!

31:16.307 --> 31:17.674
Oh, God.
Did not.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.743
Can't you
hold it? God!

31:19.744 --> 31:22.479
God damn it,
would you shut up?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.814
Did you hear
a word I said?

31:23.815 --> 31:26.249
The guys are dead!
Get a clue!

31:26.250 --> 31:28.151
Something's out there,
and it's killin' people!

31:28.152 --> 31:31.121
And if it's monsters,
nobody's gonna do a thing
about it but us.

31:33.925 --> 31:34.624
So, what do we do?

31:36.194 --> 31:37.761
Think this book
might be important.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.229
Look. It's
Van Helsing's diary.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.764
Mom said they found it
in an old house

31:40.765 --> 31:42.432
on Shadowbrook Road.

31:42.433 --> 31:44.334
But I can't read it.
It's all in German.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.269
My sister takes German
in high school.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.538
Your sister
doesn't speak German.
All she does

31:48.539 --> 31:51.041
is hang around,
and the guys
touch her tits.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.943
Your sister wouldn't
happen to live next-door,
would she?

31:52.944 --> 31:54.277
So what?

31:54.278 --> 31:56.113
That girl's
your sister?

31:58.049 --> 32:00.650
So, what do you say?
Are we Monster Squad...

32:01.953 --> 32:02.652
...or what?

32:09.127 --> 32:11.094
Cool.
All right.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.663
How does that dog
get up here, anyways?

32:52.170 --> 32:53.203
Old friend.

32:54.839 --> 32:56.206
How do you like
your new home?

32:58.009 --> 32:58.709
Home.

33:18.696 --> 33:20.697
I must
sleep soon,

33:20.698 --> 33:22.432
so listen
very carefully.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.735
Van Helsing's diary...

33:25.903 --> 33:26.737
...is missing.

33:28.206 --> 33:29.740
I want you
to retrieve it
for me.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.242
You understand?

33:33.544 --> 33:35.045
Yes...

33:35.046 --> 33:36.179
Master.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.248
Children... possess it.

33:39.884 --> 33:43.353
I want you
to find them
and take the diary.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.255
If they do not
cooperate...

33:47.392 --> 33:48.258
...you will kill them.

33:52.897 --> 33:56.066
Gentlemen, I'd just like
to say three words:

33:56.067 --> 33:59.269
Scary German Guy.

34:02.907 --> 34:04.775
Who else are we
gonna get to translate
this thing?

34:07.245 --> 34:09.079
Come on. Somebody
go up and knock.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.281
<i>You knock.
You're our leader.</i>

34:14.452 --> 34:15.851
Firstly, he's scary, okay?

34:15.853 --> 34:18.255
And "B,"
he's German.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.456
Maybe he doesn't
even speak English.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.292
Okay, so what's
German for...

34:22.293 --> 34:23.927
"Please don't
murder us"?

34:23.928 --> 34:26.797
<i>Bitte, moerden-zie
uns nicht.</i>

34:51.688 --> 34:53.456
Boys...

34:53.458 --> 34:56.827
time is almost up.

34:58.296 --> 35:01.565
It's your
last chance for pie.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.101
Thanks, Mister, uh, guy.
Now, here we go.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.335
I mean...
No, thanks.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.509
<i>So? Ja?</i>

35:12.510 --> 35:14.845
Now, where
were we?

35:16.814 --> 35:18.315
<i>Ah... ja.</i>

35:18.316 --> 35:21.284
"The amulet itself
is fairly small

35:21.285 --> 35:24.621
and carved with
intricate symbols."

35:24.622 --> 35:25.355
Oh.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.125
Rather an odd-looking
thing,

35:28.126 --> 35:29.426
don't you think?

35:29.427 --> 35:31.094
Scary German
Guy's bitchin'.

35:31.095 --> 35:33.497
Sir, the thing
I don't understand is

35:33.498 --> 35:34.798
the part about
the equilibrium.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.100
Well, according
to this rather
curious book

35:37.101 --> 35:38.535
you have
brought me,

35:38.536 --> 35:41.972
"The forces
of good and evil--"

35:41.973 --> 35:45.776
Uh, that is a B-17,
in case you are
wondering.

35:45.777 --> 35:46.376
It's rad!

35:47.812 --> 35:48.812
"Good and evil

35:48.813 --> 35:50.280
"are
in constant flux,

35:50.281 --> 35:51.481
"back and forth.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.418
"Only once,
every hundred years,

35:54.419 --> 35:57.087
are these forces
balanced."

35:57.088 --> 35:58.588
And what about
the amulet?

35:58.589 --> 36:02.526
The amulet,
so nearly as I
can translate,

36:02.527 --> 36:06.697
is "concentrated good.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.231
"It is a talisman

36:08.232 --> 36:12.369
which wards off evil
and is..."

36:12.370 --> 36:13.904
how you say, uh...

36:15.106 --> 36:17.040
"indestructible"?

36:17.041 --> 36:18.909
That means
it can't be
destroyed.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.711
Or, in any case,

36:20.712 --> 36:23.814
normally destroyed.
However,

36:23.815 --> 36:26.550
and this part
is underlined...

36:26.551 --> 36:30.153
"Once
every hundred years,

36:30.154 --> 36:33.223
"at the stoke
of midnight,

36:33.224 --> 36:37.394
"the amulet
becomes vulnerable,

36:37.395 --> 36:39.262
"and at that moment,

36:39.263 --> 36:41.131
it can be
shattered."

36:42.367 --> 36:43.133
And if it is?

36:44.669 --> 36:45.669
Then the balance

36:45.670 --> 36:47.204
between
good and evil

36:47.205 --> 36:50.640
will shift,
and evil will rule.

36:53.077 --> 36:55.812
However, our friend
Mr. Van Helsing

36:55.813 --> 37:00.751
claims there is a way
to stop the forces
of darkness.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.651
How?

37:02.754 --> 37:05.122
"If one
could gain possession

37:05.123 --> 37:08.158
of the amulet
before those forces..."

37:10.595 --> 37:12.462
"...then
every hundred years,

37:12.463 --> 37:14.264
"at midnight,

37:14.265 --> 37:16.233
"there is
another option:

37:16.234 --> 37:21.672
"a ceremony which,
when followed
to the letter,

37:21.673 --> 37:24.374
"will open a hole

37:24.375 --> 37:26.677
"into Limbo itself

37:26.678 --> 37:29.746
"where dwell
the damned;

37:29.747 --> 37:31.048
"a vortex,

37:31.049 --> 37:34.785
"which like
a great whirlwind,

37:34.786 --> 37:38.689
"can swallow
the forces of evil
forever."

37:41.926 --> 37:44.861
Well... does it describe
the procedure at all?

37:44.862 --> 37:46.063
In detail.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.165
This was the last entry.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.534
On this date,

37:50.535 --> 37:54.271
he was to battle
those forces himself.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.806
Interesting.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.941
It is
tomorrow's date,

37:57.942 --> 38:00.210
one hundred years ago!

38:07.985 --> 38:09.219
A hundred years ago?

38:11.989 --> 38:13.724
Tomorrow night.

38:16.994 --> 38:18.128
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.963
Bye. Thank you
very much
for all your time.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.932
Thank you.
I expect
you boys thought

38:21.933 --> 38:25.068
I was some kind
of monster myself?
Hmm?

38:25.069 --> 38:26.937
A vampire, perhaps?

38:26.938 --> 38:28.939
That's quite
all right.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.841
But I am not,
you know.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.743
If I were
a vampire,

38:32.744 --> 38:35.245
then I wouldn't have
a reflection.

38:38.683 --> 38:39.750
Now, would I?

38:41.352 --> 38:44.488
Man, you sure know
a lot about monsters.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.858
Now that
you mention it...

38:47.859 --> 38:49.760
I suppose I do.

38:55.266 --> 38:55.766
Guys, wait up!

38:59.203 --> 39:01.538
Tomorrow night?
What do we have to
do again?

39:01.539 --> 39:02.806
Blow a hole
in Dumbo?

39:02.807 --> 39:04.041
Limbo, stupid.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.275
So, how do
we know

39:05.276 --> 39:06.977
the amulet's
there, anyway?

39:06.978 --> 39:10.080
Because, you dweeb,
Dracula's obviously
here looking for it.

39:10.081 --> 39:13.383
If we don't find it
before he does,
we're beast bait.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.818
Okay, so,
say we get
the amulet.

39:14.819 --> 39:15.886
Then what?

39:15.887 --> 39:17.387
Wait till
midnight... and?

39:17.388 --> 39:18.388
We get
a virgin.

39:18.389 --> 39:19.723
A virgin?
Yeah.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.225
Okay, right.
Then what?

39:22.226 --> 39:24.461
Well, our virgin
takes the amulet,

39:24.462 --> 39:26.063
reads the magic spell
from the book,

39:26.064 --> 39:28.899
and, blamo, we blow
a hole in Limbo.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.067
That's so easy.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.802
Oh, a cinch.
Piece of cake.
Yeah.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.574
Rudy. Question.

39:37.575 --> 39:38.575
Shoot.

39:38.576 --> 39:39.309
Know any virgins?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.880
Okay. Rudy, find
some silver bullets.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.149
And where the hell
am I supposed to find
silver bullets?

39:46.150 --> 39:48.251
K-Mart?
I don't know.
Gimme a break.

39:48.252 --> 39:50.287
Fat Kid, get a map.
Find Shadowbrook
Road.

39:50.288 --> 39:53.023
What, do I look
in the index for
"big, scary mansion"?

39:53.024 --> 39:54.024
Oh, you're a riot.

39:54.025 --> 39:54.825
You guys!

39:58.529 --> 40:00.564
How can we trust
Scary German Guy?

40:00.565 --> 40:02.699
Why would he lie
about a thing
like this?

40:02.700 --> 40:03.934
Sean!

40:03.935 --> 40:05.068
Phoebe,
have a life.
Okay?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.069
You're being
a spaz!

40:06.070 --> 40:07.571
Ow! God!

40:07.572 --> 40:08.572
You bit me,
you brat!

40:08.573 --> 40:10.140
I'm tellin'
Mom on you!

40:10.141 --> 40:11.808
Would ya look?

40:41.472 --> 40:42.372
Huh?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.544
It's okay,
you guys!

40:47.545 --> 40:49.413
He's friends
with us.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.882
Come on!
Don't be chickenshit!

40:55.420 --> 40:56.887
Come on.
I want to show you
my friends.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.165
Sean, no.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.233
Oh, go for it.

41:10.234 --> 41:11.735
Sean, are you crazy?

41:11.736 --> 41:13.203
That's a walkin'
dead guy.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.905
Sean, please don't die.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.413
Are... are you dead?

41:23.414 --> 41:24.815
D-Dead?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.683
Does Mom know
about him?

41:26.684 --> 41:28.285
No. Only us.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.420
Hey, guys,
get over here!
He's great!

41:32.190 --> 41:32.923
Huh.
Uhh!

41:35.026 --> 41:37.928
Now can I be
in the Monster Club?

41:40.198 --> 41:42.199
I can't believe it.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.334
Frankenstein's monster
in our clubhouse.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.370
Let's ask him
to leave, okay?

41:46.371 --> 41:47.938
You're not still
scared, are you?

41:47.939 --> 41:50.240
Well, he is
a little bit
gross, Sean.

41:50.241 --> 41:50.941
Scr...

41:52.310 --> 41:53.710
Scra-aps.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.178
I taught him
to talk.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.446
Bo-gus.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.716
Give me...

41:59.717 --> 42:01.618
a... break.

42:01.619 --> 42:02.452
Huddle up, you guys.

42:05.390 --> 42:07.057
Sean, we gotta
get an adult.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.459
And your dad's a cop,
so if we get your dad--

42:09.460 --> 42:12.062
Absolutely no
grown-ups. Okay?

42:12.063 --> 42:13.730
They'll lock him up
in a cage or something.

42:13.731 --> 42:14.731
Dissect him.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.067
Or put him
on TV!
Fat Kid.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.036
Ha ha ha!
Why are you
such a lame-oid?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.303
You're the lame one.

42:21.339 --> 42:21.972
Bogus!

42:23.441 --> 42:24.474
Bogus.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.476
Dudes,
check it out.

42:54.439 --> 42:55.639
Sc...

42:55.640 --> 42:56.473
Scary?

43:33.811 --> 43:36.480
The amulet is in here.
Very near, yes.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.348
Oh... Van Helsing,

43:38.349 --> 43:40.183
your disciples
were very clumsy,

43:40.184 --> 43:43.153
trying to hide from me
the very thing
that is mine.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.022
No hiding,
never, from me.

43:48.826 --> 43:50.961
Ah! It's here!

44:08.146 --> 44:11.048
My prize.
Oh...

44:14.519 --> 44:16.687
Soon, Van Helsing...

44:16.688 --> 44:19.556
soon, the creatures
of the night
shall rule the world.

44:21.125 --> 44:25.495
And there is
no one to stop us!

44:43.881 --> 44:45.382
<i>? I don't wanna go home?</i>

44:45.383 --> 44:48.585
<i>? I don't wanna leave
the floor?</i>

44:51.055 --> 44:52.989
<i>? Someone turn
the lights down?</i>

44:52.990 --> 44:55.592
<i>? Close the cage
and lock the door?</i>

44:58.396 --> 45:01.965
<i>? We ain't gonna let
this feelin' under?</i>

45:01.966 --> 45:05.469
? We gotta cut loose
and turn it up all the way?

45:05.470 --> 45:07.104
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

45:08.906 --> 45:10.607
<i>? Dance until
your heart stops?</i>

45:12.643 --> 45:14.111
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

45:16.114 --> 45:18.115
<i>? Dance until
your feet fall off?</i>

45:20.018 --> 45:21.818
<i>? I don't want to sit down?</i>

45:21.819 --> 45:24.755
<i>? I don't need
no easy chair?</i>

45:24.756 --> 45:27.257
<i>? Oh, oh, oh?</i>

45:27.258 --> 45:29.159
<i>? Someone turn
the clock back?</i>

45:29.160 --> 45:31.928
<i>? We ain't gonna
go nowhere?</i>

45:31.929 --> 45:34.498
<i>? Hey?</i>

45:34.499 --> 45:38.135
<i>? Now we're gonna go in
big like thunder?</i>

45:38.136 --> 45:39.503
<i>? No one can stop us now?</i>

45:39.504 --> 45:41.672
<i>? We're goin' all the way?</i>

45:41.673 --> 45:44.107
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

45:44.108 --> 45:47.344
<i>? Yeah, dance
until your heart stops?</i>

45:47.345 --> 45:50.947
<i>? Oh, rock until you drop?</i>

45:50.948 --> 45:52.449
<i>? Oh, oh, oh, oh?</i>

45:52.450 --> 45:54.651
<i>? Dance until
your feet fall off?</i>

45:54.652 --> 45:55.652
<i>? No, no, no?</i>

46:02.627 --> 46:04.661
<i>? Hey?</i>

46:10.802 --> 46:14.304
<i>? We ain't gonna let this
feelin' under?</i>

46:14.305 --> 46:17.874
<i>? Cut it loose
and rock some more?</i>

46:17.875 --> 46:21.645
<i>? Now we're gonna comb
this big night under?</i>

46:21.646 --> 46:23.280
<i>? It's totally rad,
it's cool cool?</i>

46:23.281 --> 46:25.248
? It's cool cool,
it's cool?

46:25.249 --> 46:26.950
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

46:26.951 --> 46:28.618
<i>? Hey, hey?</i>

46:28.619 --> 46:30.821
<i>? Dance until
your heart stops?</i>

46:30.822 --> 46:32.489
<i>? Hey?</i>

46:32.490 --> 46:33.924
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

46:33.925 --> 46:35.859
<i>? Yeah,
hey, hey, hey?</i>

46:35.860 --> 46:38.862
<i>? Dance until
your feet fall off?</i>

46:38.863 --> 46:40.697
<i>? You better rock me?</i>

46:42.233 --> 46:43.600
<i>? Yeah, rock me?</i>

46:43.601 --> 46:45.669
<i>? Dance until
your heart stops?</i>

46:45.670 --> 46:46.903
<i>? Everybody, sing it?</i>

46:46.904 --> 46:49.006
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

46:49.007 --> 46:50.340
<i>? Rockin' dude?</i>

46:50.341 --> 46:52.476
<i>? Party till
your brains fall out?</i>

46:52.477 --> 46:54.244
<i>? Whoo-oo?</i>

46:54.245 --> 46:56.046
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

46:56.047 --> 46:57.814
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

46:57.815 --> 46:59.516
<i>? Dance until
your heart stops?</i>

46:59.517 --> 47:01.518
<i>? Party till you die?</i>

47:01.519 --> 47:02.753
<i>? Rock until you drop?</i>

47:02.754 --> 47:05.188
<i>? Baby, baby, baby?</i>

47:05.189 --> 47:07.391
<i>? Dance until
your feet fall off?</i>

47:07.392 --> 47:08.725
<i>? Ooh, yeah, rock?</i>

47:13.698 --> 47:16.733
I do regret
the dosage,
my friend.

47:20.872 --> 47:23.840
Most, um... lethal...

47:23.841 --> 47:25.242
by human standards.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.812
But then, um,

47:28.813 --> 47:31.581
human standards
do not apply, do they?

47:33.418 --> 47:36.520
Well, uh, I'll,
uh, go have a bite

47:36.521 --> 47:39.890
while you change
into something
more, um...

47:39.891 --> 47:40.757
comfortable.

48:26.938 --> 48:29.339
Last night,
near the ambulance
crash,

48:29.340 --> 48:31.375
get this--
eyewitness report:

48:31.376 --> 48:34.411
long black hearse.
No plates.

48:34.412 --> 48:35.579
You wanna ask me
about the hood
ornament?

48:35.580 --> 48:36.680
What about
the hood ornament?

48:36.681 --> 48:39.216
I thought
you'd never ask.

48:39.217 --> 48:40.817
A silver skull.

48:43.421 --> 48:44.755
I consider this
an exciting lead.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.923
I am excited.
Are you excited?
I'm thrilled.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.191
Put out an APB.

48:48.192 --> 48:49.393
I already did.

48:49.394 --> 48:50.327
I'm a very good
policeman.
You know?

48:58.002 --> 48:59.036
Crenshaw.

48:59.037 --> 49:00.404
Hurry!
Get all your men
and send them

49:00.405 --> 49:02.272
down to 666
Shadowbrook road!

49:02.273 --> 49:03.907
It's an old mansion!

49:03.908 --> 49:06.076
He's found the amulet!
There's-- There's no time!

49:06.077 --> 49:07.511
Who the hell is this?

49:07.512 --> 49:09.312
<i>I'm the one
they shot last night!</i>

49:09.313 --> 49:10.313
I'm a werewolf
now, but--

49:10.314 --> 49:11.314
<i>Have a nice night.</i>

49:11.315 --> 49:13.517
No! No! No! No!
Don't hang up!

49:13.518 --> 49:17.054
Uhh! He's gonna kill
your son!

49:58.196 --> 49:59.930
Patrick!
Come in. Patrick.

49:59.931 --> 50:01.031
<i>Patrick,
come in.</i>

50:01.032 --> 50:02.866
Yeah, we're here.
Where are you?

50:02.867 --> 50:04.935
We're almost there.
Everything set with you?

50:04.936 --> 50:06.403
Know in a minute.
Rudy?

50:07.572 --> 50:08.105
Rudy!

50:09.574 --> 50:11.108
This babe is major.

50:13.544 --> 50:14.878
Rudy's in love.

50:14.879 --> 50:16.580
Well, good for Rudy.

50:18.816 --> 50:20.617
Thanks a lot, Pete.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.595
Okay, remember--
rendezvous position "A",

50:31.596 --> 50:33.263
2200 hours.
Uhh...

50:33.264 --> 50:34.631
<i>Say what?</i>

50:34.632 --> 50:35.999
10:00, doofus.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.934
<i>How do we know
the amulet's there,
anyway?</i>

50:37.935 --> 50:39.503
We don't, but it's
all we have to go on.
Sean.

50:39.504 --> 50:41.338
<i>Okay. Well.
Good luck,
butt love.
Sean.</i>

50:41.339 --> 50:42.706
I know you are,
but what am I?
Sean.

50:42.707 --> 50:43.640
Out.

50:46.044 --> 50:47.210
What, Eugene?

50:47.211 --> 50:49.146
Creature
stole my Twinkie.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.153
So?

50:57.488 --> 50:58.655
What did you want
to ask me?

50:59.924 --> 51:02.426
What do we want
to ask you.

51:02.427 --> 51:06.229
Okay. Um, Sis...
me and Ru--

51:06.230 --> 51:07.531
Rudy?

51:07.532 --> 51:08.532
Your show, Ace.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.400
Okay.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.370
We just wanted
to know...

51:13.371 --> 51:15.172
if you're a virgin.
What?

51:17.675 --> 51:21.111
Okay. What we want
to know is...

51:21.112 --> 51:22.379
are you a--

51:22.380 --> 51:23.180
Ahem. Look.

51:24.649 --> 51:25.649
What your brother

51:25.650 --> 51:28.318
is so delicately
attempting to inquire,

51:28.319 --> 51:31.355
and let me, out of my own
personal curiosity,

51:31.356 --> 51:33.290
is the degree to which
you may have or...

51:33.291 --> 51:36.193
have not,
at some point in time...

51:40.832 --> 51:41.698
...been dorked?

51:43.468 --> 51:45.402
You guys are sick!

51:46.738 --> 51:47.671
Guess what.

51:48.940 --> 51:51.274
Fox Photo's got
a two-for-one deal
this week,

51:51.275 --> 51:53.643
and wouldn't you know it,
there's a space

51:53.644 --> 51:54.911
on the bulletin board

51:54.912 --> 51:57.814
right between
the prom committee notes...

51:57.815 --> 51:58.715
and the football roster.

52:07.692 --> 52:08.925
Sean.

52:08.926 --> 52:11.495
About this
Monster Squad thing.

52:11.496 --> 52:13.430
Maybe we could go
back to the clubhouse

52:13.431 --> 52:15.298
and rethink it
with the other guys.

52:15.299 --> 52:18.335
Fat Kid... you're
bein' a wuss.

52:18.336 --> 52:20.570
Wuss?

52:20.571 --> 52:21.605
Can it, Frank.

52:21.606 --> 52:23.240
Time's runnin' out.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.809
Sean, no!

52:25.810 --> 52:28.345
Scary house...
real monsters...

52:28.346 --> 52:31.515
us... 12 years old?
Remember?

52:31.516 --> 52:34.084
Midnight...
end of world.
Remember?

52:34.085 --> 52:36.753
Master... is near.

52:39.190 --> 52:41.758
Master wants
children dead.

52:55.606 --> 52:56.606
Um, Sean?

52:56.607 --> 52:58.342
Maybe we could be

52:58.343 --> 53:00.744
like Math Squad
instead, you know...

53:00.745 --> 53:03.046
do math problems.
Stay home.

53:03.047 --> 53:04.214
Or Nature Squad.

53:04.215 --> 53:06.283
We could look at rocks,
collect birds.

53:06.284 --> 53:07.984
Not be dead. See,

53:07.985 --> 53:09.786
it's this whole death thing
I'm not crazy about.

53:49.927 --> 53:52.763
Well... no amulet.

53:52.764 --> 53:53.797
Let's go.

53:53.798 --> 53:56.433
Look. We got
two consolations.

53:56.434 --> 53:58.435
Number one,
Frankenstein's
on our side.

53:58.436 --> 54:00.704
And number two,
my dad's a cop.

54:00.705 --> 54:03.340
Anybody fools around with us,
he kicks their ass.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.342
Hey, Frankie.

54:06.678 --> 54:07.344
Come on.

54:26.898 --> 54:27.831
Frank!

54:31.569 --> 54:34.237
Wake up!
Wake up!

54:34.238 --> 54:35.806
Eugene, get
away from there!

54:35.807 --> 54:37.641
He won't wake up!

54:37.642 --> 54:40.077
Fat Kid, use your eyes.
Does it look like
you can help him?

54:40.078 --> 54:42.646
But-- But what
do I do, Sean?

54:42.647 --> 54:43.880
A monster!

54:43.881 --> 54:45.115
Don't call him
a monster.

54:45.116 --> 54:47.150
Well... what
if he's dead?

54:47.151 --> 54:48.885
Then he died
to help us.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.088
Now, look.

54:51.089 --> 54:54.157
I'm the leader
of this squad,

54:54.158 --> 54:54.891
so listen up.

54:56.661 --> 54:59.329
He said Dracula
knows we're here.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.865
So let's just try
to find the amulet...

55:04.669 --> 55:05.902
...and get the hell
outta here.

55:08.673 --> 55:10.674
Sean!
Aah!

55:10.675 --> 55:12.109
Kick him
in the nards!
What?

55:12.110 --> 55:13.176
Kick him in the nards!

55:13.177 --> 55:15.412
He doesn't have nards!
Do it! Do it!

55:18.349 --> 55:20.150
Wolfman's got nards!

55:20.151 --> 55:22.019
Come on! Come on!

55:22.020 --> 55:23.320
Oh...

55:33.898 --> 55:35.365
Aah!

55:57.488 --> 55:59.623
<i>What are you doin'?
Haven't you read
The Hardy Boys?</i>

55:59.624 --> 56:02.059
You pull some lever down
and a secret door opens!

56:02.060 --> 56:04.361
You gotta
be kidding!
You have
a better idea?

56:15.673 --> 56:17.507
Come on, Sean.

56:17.508 --> 56:19.343
Damn!
Where is he?

56:19.344 --> 56:20.410
Where are you?
Come in!

56:22.113 --> 56:23.680
Sean!

56:23.681 --> 56:25.415
Where are you,
Sean?

56:26.851 --> 56:29.152
10:00.
They're late.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.221
Maybe the monsters
got them.

56:31.222 --> 56:33.924
"Maybe the monsters
got them."

56:43.101 --> 56:44.868
Can we go home, Sean?
Oh, great.

56:44.869 --> 56:47.704
Please? Can't we go home?
Just great.

56:47.705 --> 56:49.339
Frankenstein's dead,

56:49.340 --> 56:50.674
Eugene's whining,

56:50.675 --> 56:52.476
and we're sitting here
with Pirate Bill.

56:52.477 --> 56:54.711
Come on, Sean.
Man, we're dead.

56:54.712 --> 56:55.445
Eugene, stop it.

57:02.220 --> 57:02.953
Bingo.

57:28.713 --> 57:29.479
You guys, I got it!

57:31.082 --> 57:32.616
Give it to me.

57:32.617 --> 57:33.984
Give it to me!

57:33.985 --> 57:36.253
Aah!

57:36.254 --> 57:39.389
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

57:39.390 --> 57:40.824
Help!

57:40.825 --> 57:41.825
Give it to me!

57:41.826 --> 57:44.394
Aah!

57:44.395 --> 57:47.497
Garlic! Come on!
Get outta here!

58:05.450 --> 58:06.450
You guys,

58:06.451 --> 58:09.453
we got Scary German Guy
to help us!

58:09.454 --> 58:11.388
The cavalry!
Thank Christ.

58:11.389 --> 58:12.889
Yeah, we figured
you guys were in trouble.

58:12.890 --> 58:14.891
It was boss!
I saw Dracula!

58:14.892 --> 58:17.427
And I kicked Wolfman in the nards--
Fat Kid, bag it. Okay?

58:17.428 --> 58:19.096
Is she a virgin?
Why don't you put it

58:19.097 --> 58:20.731
on the 6:00 news,
you little shit?

58:20.732 --> 58:21.732
Yeah, she is.

58:21.733 --> 58:23.066
Perhaps we should all

58:23.067 --> 58:25.002
go back to my place
for some pie.

58:26.704 --> 58:28.805
The book was right.

58:28.806 --> 58:31.308
Don't you see?
It's all true!

58:31.309 --> 58:34.244
We found the amulet,
but now there's monsters after us.

58:34.245 --> 58:36.913
We gotta go to a place
where there's a lot of people.

58:36.914 --> 58:37.948
Church.
What?

58:37.949 --> 58:39.449
Church!
He's right.

58:39.450 --> 58:41.318
There's an old church
in the town plaza.

58:41.319 --> 58:42.319
Perfect.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.520
Monsters hate religious stuff.

58:46.324 --> 58:47.324
Del.

58:47.325 --> 58:48.325
Del. Del!

58:48.326 --> 58:49.326
Look, I'm sorry.

58:49.327 --> 58:50.761
What, you
tryin' to tell me

58:50.762 --> 58:52.162
that we're gonna go
all the way out to Shadowbrook Road

58:52.163 --> 58:53.930
because you get
a call from some guy

58:53.931 --> 58:55.465
who tells you
he's a werewolf?

58:55.466 --> 58:57.668
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!

58:57.669 --> 58:58.969
Look, I'm sorry.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.237
I guess it's feasible, Del.

59:00.238 --> 59:01.772
Listen to me.
Come on, man.

59:01.773 --> 59:04.374
I apologize. All right?
Ha ha ha!

59:09.580 --> 59:12.416
Look! It's 20 minutes
till midnight!

59:12.417 --> 59:14.618
We pull this off,
I'm gonna shit!

59:21.759 --> 59:22.759
Holy shit!

59:22.760 --> 59:24.061
Jesus Christ!

59:29.967 --> 59:31.668
Give me some slack!
What are you doing?

59:31.669 --> 59:34.037
Patrick, just give me some slack!
No!

59:34.038 --> 59:36.039
You're closer! Just give me some slack!
No way!

59:36.040 --> 59:37.207
Don't be a wuss!

59:37.208 --> 59:38.408
Okay!

59:38.409 --> 59:40.577
Aah!

59:55.993 --> 59:58.061
Come on! Hurry!

01:00:01.132 --> 01:00:03.200
Yes!
Come on! Let go! Let go!

01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:06.236
Let go of her! Let go!
Aah!

01:00:06.237 --> 01:00:07.237
Go! Go!

01:00:07.238 --> 01:00:08.839
Go! Look at that!
It's dust!

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.475
Come on! Yes! Come on!

01:00:11.476 --> 01:00:12.109
Go! Whoa!

01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:16.546
See you later...
Band-Aid breath.

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:20.751
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:20.752 --> 01:00:22.319
Del, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.187
but we're going
a hundred miles an hour!

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.822
I notice little things
like that.

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.591
I'm a very good policeman.
You know that?

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:38.635
Aah!
Aah!

01:00:47.445 --> 01:00:48.879
I'm not sayin'
anything.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.315
Not a single word.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.150
I appreciate that.

01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:34.691
Meeting adjourned.

01:01:47.105 --> 01:01:49.239
<i>Dispatch to Unit 28. Please respond.</i>

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.207
Freeze!

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.710
You move, and
I'll kill you!

01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:58.648
Dispatch, we got a 10-35.

01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:00.717
Send backup! Hurry it up!

01:02:01.853 --> 01:02:03.186
Del!
Get outta there!

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.230
That's enough.

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:29.746
I will have your son.

01:02:49.534 --> 01:02:50.267
Del?

01:02:51.536 --> 01:02:52.903
Del?

01:02:52.904 --> 01:02:54.871
D-Del, what's happening?

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:55.872
What?

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:56.773
The kids.

01:02:58.076 --> 01:02:59.076
Sean?

01:02:59.077 --> 01:03:00.243
Phoebe.

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:01.912
Phoebe?

01:03:01.913 --> 01:03:02.779
Sean!

01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:04.781
Phoebe!

01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:11.421
Sean, can you hear me?

01:03:11.422 --> 01:03:12.289
Where are you?

01:03:13.758 --> 01:03:16.927
Sean! Can you hear me?
Where are you?

01:03:16.928 --> 01:03:19.629
<i>Dad! I'm here!
We're almost to Town Square.</i>

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.297
<i>Hurry up!</i>

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.517
Don't kick the church!
It's religious!

01:03:40.518 --> 01:03:41.952
It's locked
is what it is.

01:03:41.953 --> 01:03:42.953
Fine.

01:03:42.954 --> 01:03:43.820
Okay.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.424
We'll just have to
do it right here.

01:03:47.425 --> 01:03:49.126
Like, really
religious, Sean.

01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:51.461
Why don't we just
go over and do it in Burger King?

01:03:51.462 --> 01:03:53.196
You guys!

01:03:57.135 --> 01:03:58.402
Oh, shit!

01:03:58.403 --> 01:03:59.536
Patrick,

01:03:59.537 --> 01:04:01.038
Okay, come on, read the book.
Go!

01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:02.039
Okay!
Read! Go!

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.473
Wait!
Read!

01:04:03.474 --> 01:04:05.075
I'm flunking German!

01:04:05.076 --> 01:04:06.810
Read it in German.
Try.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:10.881
Damn! Really,
you should read it!

01:04:10.882 --> 01:04:12.649
He's not a virgin,
you stupid!

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:13.817
Did you ask him?

01:04:13.818 --> 01:04:15.352
Where you goin',
Rudy?

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:17.854
I'm in the god damn club,
aren't I?

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.857
I don't believe this!

01:04:23.828 --> 01:04:25.862
Will you speak English?
I can't understand you!

01:04:29.267 --> 01:04:30.334
Come on!
Drunken munchkin warehouse!

01:04:33.938 --> 01:04:36.206
Yeah, yeah,

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.841
Okay, skanks,

01:04:37.842 --> 01:04:38.875
come and get it.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:43.180
Aah!

01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:44.381
I don't believe this.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:52.389
Unh!

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:54.391
Uhh!

01:05:05.203 --> 01:05:07.204
Please read!
Oh, shit!

01:05:07.205 --> 01:05:08.405
Sean, look out!

01:05:16.147 --> 01:05:17.180
Dad!

01:05:17.181 --> 01:05:17.914
You stay there!

01:05:36.768 --> 01:05:37.934
My God.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.307
Aah...

01:05:49.914 --> 01:05:51.748
Suck on this,
you son of a bitch.

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:06.496
Aah!

01:06:06.497 --> 01:06:08.398
Hey, asshole.

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:09.466
You looked.

01:06:20.778 --> 01:06:21.478
It's okay.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:42.065
All right, let's try it again,
now, shall we?

01:06:42.066 --> 01:06:43.166
Look, you've
got me upset!

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.501
Read it?
Come on, read!

01:07:02.387 --> 01:07:03.387
Oh, my God!

01:07:03.388 --> 01:07:04.721
I said it!

01:07:04.722 --> 01:07:05.856
Ho ho!
All right!

01:07:05.857 --> 01:07:08.625
You did!
I have absolutely no idea how!

01:07:08.626 --> 01:07:09.526
I--

01:07:11.496 --> 01:07:12.029
Where's Limbo?

01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:29.346
We just went through
some major shit,

01:07:29.347 --> 01:07:30.781
and where's
the big Limbo thing?

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:40.824
Jesus... Christ!

01:07:40.825 --> 01:07:42.859
Holy shit!

01:07:47.365 --> 01:07:48.465
Let's get him!
Let's go!

01:07:50.702 --> 01:07:51.568
Go! Go!

01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:55.672
Are you

01:07:55.673 --> 01:07:57.207
that she is...

01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:59.710
You're not a virgin,
are you?

01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:01.478
No? No, what do you
mean, no?

01:08:01.479 --> 01:08:04.147
Well... Steve, but
he doesn't count!

01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:05.082
Doesn't count?

01:08:08.052 --> 01:08:09.553

01:08:48.259 --> 01:08:49.626
Only one way

01:08:59.437 --> 01:09:00.437
What?

01:09:00.438 --> 01:09:03.439
Is she a vershion?

01:09:03.441 --> 01:09:05.942
She? A virgin?

01:09:05.943 --> 01:09:09.345
Yes! A virgin!
We'll use the girl!

01:09:09.346 --> 01:09:11.348
She can't read!
She's five years old!

01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:13.050
I'll help her!

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.652

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.462
Hey, sweetheart.

01:16:00.058 --> 01:16:00.757
Who's Eugene?

01:16:03.027 --> 01:16:05.028
All right, son...
where are they?

01:16:05.029 --> 01:16:06.296
Where are
the monsters?

01:16:06.297 --> 01:16:07.764
The mummy
came in my house.

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:15.272
Can somebody tell me what the
Sam Hell is goin' on around here?

01:16:17.075 --> 01:16:18.342
Well, we can, sir.

01:16:18.343 --> 01:16:19.276
Well, who are you?

01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:28.552
We're the Monster Squad.

01:16:34.892 --> 01:16:36.059
All right, pal!

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.494
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:16:37.495 --> 01:16:38.729
<i>? Gotta get up,
gotta get out?</i>

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.664
Who the hell is she?

01:16:40.665 --> 01:16:42.733
Yeah!

01:16:42.734 --> 01:16:45.235
<i>? In a hundred years,
in the darkest night?</i>

01:16:45.236 --> 01:16:47.571
<i>? The forces of evil
come out to fight?</i>

01:16:47.572 --> 01:16:49.973
<i>? The amulet
they must destroy?</i>

01:16:49.974 --> 01:16:52.576
<i>? Or spend forever
in the darkest void?</i>

01:16:52.577 --> 01:16:54.911
<i>? Who can stop
their deadly might?</i>

01:16:54.912 --> 01:16:57.047
<i>? Who will stand up
for the right?</i>

01:16:57.048 --> 01:16:59.616
<i>? From the mouth of babes
comes dynamite?</i>

01:16:59.617 --> 01:17:01.651
<i>? The Monster Squad
gonna groove tonight?</i>

01:17:01.652 --> 01:17:04.488
<i>? First came Dracula,

01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:06.590
<i>? Mummy and the creature
from the Black Lagoon?</i>

01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:09.092
<i>? We need silver bullets,
we need wooden stakes?</i>

01:17:09.093 --> 01:17:11.328
<i>? Normal stuff won't stop 'em
'cause they live on hate?</i>

01:17:11.329 --> 01:17:13.730
<i>? Speak some magic words
from a virgin's lips?</i>

01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:16.299
<i>? Maybe that'll shake 'em,
make 'em slip and trip?</i>

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.502
<i>? There's no turnin' back,
gotta fight the fight?</i>

01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:21.004
<i>? Yeah, the Monster Squad
gonna get 'em tonight?</i>

01:17:22.607 --> 01:17:24.608

<i>? We're the Monster Squad,

01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:30.514
<i>? Better run and hide?</i>

01:17:32.116 --> 01:17:34.284
<i>? Monster Squad?</i>

01:17:34.285 --> 01:17:37.521
<i>? We're the Monster Squad,
and the forces of evil?</i>

01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:40.991
<i>? Best beware of
the Monster Squad?</i>

01:17:49.967 --> 01:17:51.868
<i>? Gotta get up,
gotta get out?</i>

01:17:51.869 --> 01:17:53.570
<i>? We got work to do?</i>

01:17:53.571 --> 01:17:54.838
<i>? Work to do?</i>

01:17:54.839 --> 01:17:56.673
<i>? Gotta get up,
gotta get out?</i>

01:17:56.674 --> 01:17:59.476
<i>? We got work to do,

01:17:59.477 --> 01:18:01.912
<i>? Mama can't help us,
Dad don't understand?</i>

01:18:01.913 --> 01:18:02.913
<i>? No one will believe it?</i>

01:18:02.914 --> 01:18:04.381
<i>? Put it in our hands?</i>

01:18:04.382 --> 01:18:06.783
<i>? Gotta stop those creatures,
send them back to hell?</i>

01:18:06.784 --> 01:18:09.219
<i>? Or there's no tomorrow,
no saved by the bell?</i>

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.455
<i>? There's no place to run,
nowhere to hide?</i>

01:18:11.456 --> 01:18:13.824
<i>? Now it's time to see
what you got inside?</i>

01:18:13.825 --> 01:18:16.226
<i>? No evil will
escape my sight?</i>

01:18:16.227 --> 01:18:18.462
<i>? Yeah, the Monster Squad

01:18:33.011 --> 01:18:35.479
<i>? And you'll never see
such a ghastly sight?</i>

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.581
<i>? When the Monster Squad
saves the world tonight?</i>

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:41.184
<i>? Monster Squad?</i>

01:18:41.185 --> 01:18:44.087
<i>? We're the Monster Squad,
and the forces of evil...?</i>
