WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:08.809
KATELYN, CALM DOWN,
OKAY? CALM DOWN.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.512
YES, KATELYN,
CALM DOWN!

00:11.545 --> 00:14.482
YEAH, YOU NEED
TO CHILL OUT!

00:14.515 --> 00:15.816
( both laughing )

00:15.849 --> 00:17.551
UHH!

00:17.585 --> 00:19.787
RODNEY BREAKS UP
WITH YOU EVERY TWO WEEKS.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.590
THAT IS, LIKE,
TOTALLY NORMAL.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.458
NO! NO, DON'T CRY,
DON'T CRY.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.527
OKAY, SCREAM. eaming )

00:26.560 --> 00:30.464
SCREAMING IS SO GOOD!

00:30.498 --> 00:32.600
( both shrieking )

00:32.633 --> 00:34.835
I AM SO SICK OF YOU!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.404
NO, NO, NO!

00:36.437 --> 00:38.072
I'M NOT SICK OF YOU,
KATELYN.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.840
MAYBE RODNEY
JUST NEEDS SOME SPACE.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.510
YEAH, MAYBE RODNEY'S
AN ASTRONAUT!

00:42.543 --> 00:47.415
YEAH, MAYBE HE DUMPED
KATELYN FOR A ONE-EYED
MARTIAN GIRL!

00:47.448 --> 00:49.550
KATELYN, HOLD ON!

00:49.583 --> 00:51.452
OOH!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.589
( no audible sound )

00:55.623 --> 00:57.491
OKAY,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

00:57.525 --> 00:59.527
I GOT THIS.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.863
( metallic clang )

01:02.896 --> 01:04.831
( laughter )

01:04.864 --> 01:06.634
I LOVE MAGNETS!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.113
MR. DAVENPORT,
I CANNOT STAND THEM ANYMORE.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.515
CAN THEY PLEASE GO
LIVE IN YOUR WAREHOUSE?

01:21.549 --> 01:25.519
BREE, THE WAREHOUSE
IS WHERE I KEEP MY
EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS.

01:25.553 --> 01:29.490
LIKE I SAID,
CAN THEY PLEASE GO
LIVE IN YOUR WAREHOUSE?

01:29.523 --> 01:31.859
WELL, DONALD,
SHE IS GETTING OLDER.
SHE NEEDS PRIVACY.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.895
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HER
ONE OF YOUR EXTRA ROOMS?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.498
WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.667
I DO NOT HAVE
ANY EXTRA ROOMS.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.503
YOU HAVE
A POOL TABLE ROOM,
BUMPER CAR ROOM,

01:42.536 --> 01:44.572
ARCADE ROOM,
SURF SIMULATOR ROOM,

01:44.605 --> 01:48.576
NOT TO MENTION
A ROOM FULL OF MIRRORS!

01:48.609 --> 01:50.544
YEAH, OR AS
I LIKE TO CALL IT,

01:50.578 --> 01:51.712
A ROOM FULL OF ME.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.551
OKAY, BREE, YOU CAN
HAVE MY SEWING ROOM.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.154
YES! SO LONG, BOZOS!

02:00.188 --> 02:01.522
FINE.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.690
WITHOUT YOU,
WE WILL MAKE THE LAB

02:02.723 --> 02:05.593
TOTALLY AWESOME
FOR OURSELVES.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.695
THAT'S RIGHT.
NO MORE HAIR SCRUNCHIES

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
OR RAINBOW-COLORED
TOE SOCKS

02:09.530 --> 02:11.499
OR PRETTY, PINKY,
SHINY JUNK!

02:11.532 --> 02:13.567
OOH, BUT I'M
A LITTLE CHAPPED.

02:13.601 --> 02:17.171
COULD I BORROW SOME
OF YOUR BUBBLE BERRY
PUCKER BOMB?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.710
MAN, IT'S ALWAYS
SO HARD NOT TO EAT.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.517
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.519
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:31.552 --> 02:32.553
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:32.586 --> 02:35.589
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:35.623 --> 02:37.958
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:37.991 --> 02:41.629
**

02:46.667 --> 02:48.602
All: AAAAHHH!

03:18.532 --> 03:20.468
( chuckling )

03:20.501 --> 03:23.237
MAN, THIS IS AWESOME.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.306
BIGGER IS ALWAYS BETTER,

03:25.339 --> 03:26.474
EXCEPT FOR IN THIS CASE,

03:26.507 --> 03:30.244
WHERE THE LITTLE GUY
JUST KICKED THE BIG
GUY'S BUTT.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.513
UH, YOU KNOW, LEO,
I DON'T LET JUST ANYBODY

03:32.546 --> 03:34.415
USE MY HOLOSCOPIC SCREEN.

03:34.448 --> 03:38.286
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BIG
FATHER/SON MOMENT FOR US.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.254
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
PLAY CATCH.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.522
THAT'S JUST GONNA GET UGLY.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.363
SO, BIG "D,"
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

03:49.397 --> 03:52.266
I DON'T KNOW.
 CAN YOU?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.467
( faint chuckle )

03:53.501 --> 03:55.503
IT'S FUNNY EVERY TIME.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.541
SO... LET'S SAY
THERE'S THIS GIRL

04:00.574 --> 04:03.311
YOU WANTED TO ASK OUT.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.347
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

04:07.515 --> 04:09.417
WHAT, YOUR MOM
DIDN'T PUT YOU UP--?

04:09.450 --> 04:12.320
THEN NEVER MIND.
SORRY. CARRY ON.

04:12.353 --> 04:16.357
SEE, THERE'S
THIS GIRL I REALLY LIKE,

04:16.390 --> 04:18.426
AND WE LIKE A LOT OF
THE SAME THINGS:

04:18.459 --> 04:21.362
SCIENCE, COMIC BOOKS,
AND I...

04:21.394 --> 04:23.431
I THOUGHT SHE SMILED
AT ME ONE TIME,

04:23.464 --> 04:26.434
BUT INSTEAD OF SMILING
BACK, I DID ONE OF THESE:

04:27.535 --> 04:31.472
LEO, I-I THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.342
UM... YOU'RE IN LOVE!

04:34.375 --> 04:35.543
NO! NO!

04:35.576 --> 04:38.346
I AM NOT IN LOVE!
I AM NOT IN LOVE!

04:38.379 --> 04:40.314
I'M JUST CAREFULLY
EXPLORING MY OPTIONS

04:40.348 --> 04:43.551
AS I VENTURE INTO A PLACE
I LIKE TO CALL "LADYLAND."

04:43.584 --> 04:45.553
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO YOU?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.588
NOT A CLUE.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.324
WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I MET YOUR MOM,

04:50.358 --> 04:51.425
I OFFERED HER A RIDE

04:51.459 --> 04:54.462
IN MY FUTURISTIC,
HIGH-SPEED HELICOPTER.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.430
SO I CAN BORROW
THE HELICOPTER?

04:56.464 --> 04:58.366
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA--

04:58.399 --> 05:01.635
IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE
WHERE BAD IDEAS ARE GREAT.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.507
LEO, WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

05:06.540 --> 05:07.408
YOU'RE LIKE ME.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.544
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SMART
AND YOU'RE HANDSOME,

05:10.578 --> 05:12.513
BUT PEOPLE THINK
YOU'RE A NERD,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.515
SO YOU'VE GOT
TO BE FLASHY

05:14.548 --> 05:16.484
SO THEY KNOW
HOW COOL YOU ARE.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.553
OKAY. "BE FLASHY."
GOT IT.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.489
I'M GONNA TRY SOME
OF THAT ON JANELLE.

05:21.522 --> 05:25.559
BUT LET'S KEEP THAT
BETWEEN US, OKAY?

05:25.593 --> 05:26.460
ABSOLUTELY.

05:26.494 --> 05:30.498
WHAT HAPPENS IN LADYLAND
STAYS IN LADYLAND.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.440
( gong resounds softly )

05:39.473 --> 05:42.643
( gong cWHOO! loudly )

05:42.676 --> 05:45.579
SO, I WAS LOOKING FOR
STUFF TO SPRUCE UP
OUR NEW PAD,

05:45.613 --> 05:48.416
AND I FOUND
THIS AWESOME CHAIR.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.384
SOMEONE JUST
LEFT IT ON THE CURB

05:50.418 --> 05:52.486
WITH A "TAKE ME,
I'M FREE" SIGN ON IT.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.655
SUCKAS!

05:54.688 --> 05:57.425
( coughing )

05:57.458 --> 06:00.594
OH, LOOK, AND IT COMES
WITH A FREE CHIHUAHUA.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.663
ADAM! THAT'S A RAT!

06:02.696 --> 06:05.566
OH, GOOD, THEN IT WON'T
KEEP ME UP WITH ITS BARKING.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.405
ADAM, GET THAT CHAIR
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.642
WELL, IF I DO THAT,
THEN WHERE'S THE RAT
SUPPOSED TO LIVE?

06:14.675 --> 06:17.711
HOW 'BOUT WE CHECK
WITH THE NEIGHBOR'S CAT.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.416
HEY, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE MY RAT,

06:22.450 --> 06:24.618
WHY'D YOU BUY HIM
SUCH A FANCY LITTLE
HOT TUB?

06:24.652 --> 06:27.588
NO! YOU KEEP THAT
DISEASE-RIDDEN THING

06:27.621 --> 06:29.690
OUT OF MY ZEN FOUNTAIN.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.525
AND IF HE
CAN'T SWIM IN IT,

06:31.559 --> 06:32.660
THEN I DON'T
WANT IT IN HERE.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.429
THE FOUNTAIN STAYS.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.431
THE RAT STAYS.

06:37.465 --> 06:40.434
OKAY, THERE IS ONLY
ONE SOLUTION FOR THIS.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.470
WE'LL HAVE TO SPLIT
THE ROOM DOWN THE MIDDLE.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.574
FINE. ME AND MY PET
WILL BE HAPPY RIGHT
OVER HERE.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.543
GREAT. THEN THIS
WILL BE MY HALF.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.712
FINE. GOOD NEWS,
MR. LITTLE PAWS.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.648
YOU AND I ARE
GONNA BE ROOMIES.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.484
OH, LOOK!

06:56.517 --> 06:59.553
HE'S SO EXCITED,
HE MADE RAISINS!

07:02.656 --> 07:04.458
KATELYN,
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.659
I TOTALLY GOT
MY OWN ROOM.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.597
NOW I CAN GIVE YOU
MISGUIDED BOYFRIEND
ADVICE IN PEACE.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.701
WHAT?

07:13.734 --> 07:16.470
KATELYN,
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.606
( UH, TASHA!)

07:18.639 --> 07:19.673
TASHA!

07:19.707 --> 07:21.575
OH! ARE YOU ON THE PHONE?

07:21.609 --> 07:22.710
SORRY.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.745
I'LL JUST
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.616
OKAY, KATELYN,
WHERE WERE WE?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.751
( pounding )

07:30.784 --> 07:33.521
LOOK, IT'S YOU AND ME:

07:33.554 --> 07:37.525
"BFF's." THAT'S
"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER."

07:37.558 --> 07:38.626
I KNOW.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.696
I'M JUST SO EXCITED
TO HAVE YOU UP HERE.

07:42.730 --> 07:47.501
GO AHEAD, PRETEND
I'M NOT HERE.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.770
ANYWAY, KATELYN,
I WOULD JUST GIVE
IT SOME TIME,

07:49.803 --> 07:51.639
PLAY IT COOL,
AND HOPEFULLY RODNEY

07:51.672 --> 07:52.640
WILL COME TO HIS SENSES.

07:52.673 --> 07:56.510
OOH. I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.645
UH, DO YOU MIND?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.613
OH, SURE. NO PROBLEM.

07:59.647 --> 08:03.517
KATELYN, IT'S TASHA.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.519
YOU GOTTA SHOW
THAT BOY WHO'S BOSS.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.555
IF IT WERE ME,
I WOULD GRAB HIM
BY THE COLLAR

08:07.588 --> 08:08.722
AND I WOULD SAY,
"YOU ARE NOT GONNA

08:08.756 --> 08:10.624
WALK ALL OVER ME,
MISTER!"

08:10.658 --> 08:13.527
( Katelyn crying )

08:13.561 --> 08:15.663
OH, YOU'RE A CRIER.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.831
THIS IS GONNA
TAKE ALL NIGHT.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.671
OOH, HONEY.

08:23.704 --> 08:27.575
GUESS WHO IS THE WORLD'S
GREATEST STEPDAD-
SLASH-INVENTOR?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.544
ACCORDING TO THIS MUG,
IT'S ME.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.712
I'M SURPRISED IT DOESN'T
HAVE YOUR FACE ON IT.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.582
BAM!

08:36.683 --> 08:39.653
GET THIS: LEO AND I
HAD A MOMENT,

08:39.687 --> 08:42.655
AND HE TOLD ME
ABOUT A GIRL.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.725
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

08:44.758 --> 08:47.695
WELL, I CAN'T.
HE ASKED ME NOT
TO SAY ANYTHING--

08:47.728 --> 08:49.663
HER NAME IS JANELLE!

08:49.697 --> 08:51.832
AAH! I KNEW IT!
( laughing )

08:51.865 --> 08:53.767
WAIT, YOU KNEW?
HOW DID YOU--?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.736
YESTERDAY HE SLIPPED
AND ASKED ME FOR

08:55.769 --> 08:58.572
A PEANUT BUTTER
AND "JANELLEY" SANDWICH.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.773
( laughter )

08:59.807 --> 09:02.676
I KNOW HER MOTHER.
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

09:02.710 --> 09:04.678
HE WAS HAVING A LITTLE
TROUBLE TALKING TO HER,

09:04.712 --> 09:07.681
SO I KIND OF HELPED HIM
OUT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.684
"GO, DAD, GO."

09:10.718 --> 09:13.654
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
THE HELICOPTER LINE,
DID YOU?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.656
UH... NO.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.556
YEAH.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.596
( knock on door )

09:22.630 --> 09:23.864
MOM.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.766
( knock on door )

09:25.799 --> 09:27.801
MOM!

09:27.835 --> 09:29.870
( knock on door )

09:34.908 --> 09:36.644
JANELLE!

09:39.813 --> 09:43.684
OKAY. LEO, BE CALM.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.785
THINK FLASHY.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.626
WELL, HELLO THERE,
JANELLE.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.796
THE STRONG WIND IN HERE
BLEW THE DOOR SHUT.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.802
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
WINDOWS OPEN TO CREATE
A CROSS BREEZE.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.673
SUDDENLY I'M TORN,
BECAUSE IT'S BOTH GOOD

10:05.706 --> 10:07.941
AND BAD YOU'RE SMART
ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.856
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:22.890 --> 10:25.826
WELL, I'M SUPPOSED
TO PICK UP SOME COOKIES
YOUR MOM MADE.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.762
I GUESS SHE KNOWS MY MOM,
AND THEY DO SOME KIND OF...

10:28.796 --> 10:31.799
WEIRD COOKIE EXCHANGE.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.667
LEO!

10:33.701 --> 10:35.703
WHO'S AT THE DOOR?

10:35.736 --> 10:36.937
IT'S JANELLE.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.673
SHE'S HER FOR THE COOKIES.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.675
OH, NO. I ATE THEM ALL.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.943
I'M SUCH A PIG.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.680
BUT HERE'S AN IDEA:

10:46.714 --> 10:48.749
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
MAKE MORE?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.951
LEO IS VERY HANDY
IN THE KITCHEN.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.755
HE WOULD MAKE A GREAT
HUSBAND ONE DAY.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.695
JANELLE, PLEASE
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

11:01.729 --> 11:03.831
BUT I DID NOT WANT
YOU TO COME HERE.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.768
YEAH, I COULD TELL
BY THE WAY YOU SLAMMED
THE DOOR IN MY FACE.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.906
NO, I-I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.942
LEO, I HATE TO BAKE,

11:14.975 --> 11:16.944
AND I HEAR
YOUR MOM COMING,

11:16.977 --> 11:19.012
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.753
I GOT HEART-SHAPED
COOKIE CUTTERS!

11:25.786 --> 11:26.920
WHERE'D SHE GO?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.889
MOM, WHY DID YOU
INVITE HER HERE?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.791
ME? I DIDN'T!

11:30.824 --> 11:32.926
WELL, I WOULDN'T.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.994
DID SHE SAY--?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.997
AND WHAT'S UP WITH
MR. "BLABBENPORT"?

11:37.030 --> 11:41.001
I SPILL MY GUTS TO HIM,
AND HE BLABS ALL ABOUT IT.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.738
HEY, BUDDY, WHAT DO
YOU SAY WE FIRE UP
THE BUMPER CARS?

11:44.772 --> 11:48.008
YOU TOLD MY MOM
ABOUT JANELLE!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.710
I'LL NEVER
TRUST YOU AGAIN.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.817
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A FATHER/SON MOMENT,

11:56.850 --> 11:59.953
SO... I'M JUST GONNA
MOM MY WAY OUT OF IT.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.975
NICE COW.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.944
IS DAVENPORT DOWN HERE?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.913
GOOD.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.815
I'M MAD AT HIM,
BUT I NEED ONE OF
HIS GADGETS

12:27.848 --> 12:29.917
SO I CAN BE FLASHY
FOR JANELLE.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.822
LEO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:34.855 --> 12:35.923
I'D LOVE
TO TELL YOU MORE,

12:35.956 --> 12:37.958
BUT I'VE LOST MY
ABILITY TO TRUST.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.931
CHECK IT OUT:
ANOTHER THING LEFT
FOR US ON THE STREET.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.968
ADAM, THAT WAS BOLTED
TO THE SIDEWALK!

12:48.001 --> 12:50.804
YOU JUST STOLE
PRIVATE PROPERTY.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.806
OH, NO, DON'T WORRY,
I LEFT THE NEWSPAPERS
ON THE GROUND.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
I JUST WANTED THE BOX.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.078
I'M RUNNING OUT OF SPACE.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.113
I THINK I MIGHT
PUT IT OVER HERE.

13:00.147 --> 13:04.051
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, YOU DON'T.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.819
THIS IS MY SIDE.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.887
TRY AND STOP ME.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.988
I WILL.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.993
I SET UP AN INVISIBLE
ELECTRIC FENCE.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.095
YOU WENT RIGHT--
YOWW!

13:18.999 --> 13:20.100
OH, NO WAY!

13:20.133 --> 13:22.135
YOU WERE LAUGHING SO HARD,
YOU BENT OVER LIKE THIS--

13:22.169 --> 13:23.904
OHHH!

13:23.937 --> 13:26.907
OKAY, THAT'S
STARTING TO HURT!

13:30.911 --> 13:32.045
NICE COW.

13:32.079 --> 13:36.149
UM, LOOK, LEO,
I'M REALLY SORRY
I BETRAYED YOUR TRUST.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.051
I JUST GOT REALLY EXCITED

13:38.085 --> 13:41.088
'CAUSE WE HAD THIS NICE
FATHER/SON MOMENT.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.123
I GOT IT. FINE.
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.159
( shrieking )

13:49.162 --> 13:52.065
OH, I'M SO SORRY!
I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS OFF!

13:54.902 --> 13:57.170
( squeegee rubbing glass )

14:02.142 --> 14:03.110
MORNING!

14:03.143 --> 14:04.044
WHOA!

14:04.077 --> 14:07.047
I JUST WANTED TO KEEP
YOUR NEW ROOM FRESH.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.950
OH, AND GOOD NEWS--
I TALKED WITH KATELYN.

14:09.983 --> 14:13.987
SHE'S BACK
WITH RODNEY. YAY!

14:14.021 --> 14:15.055
UM, TASHA, NO OFFENSE,

14:15.088 --> 14:18.125
BUT I MOVED UP HERE
SO I COULD HAVE
SOME PRIVACY.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.061
I TOTALLY GET IT,
SO LOOK WHAT I DID!

14:21.094 --> 14:23.964
WHEE!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.072
WHOA.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.243
PRIVACY. YAY!

14:41.214 --> 14:44.051
JANELLE,
THANKS FOR COMING.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.120
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I ASKED YOU HERE.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.022
WE'RE AT SCHOOL.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.025
OH, YOU!

14:52.059 --> 14:55.062
ANYWAY, I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING

14:55.095 --> 14:58.966
THAT SOMEONE WHO'S
BOTH COOL BUT NERDY
CAN APPRECIATE.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.002
PLEASE IGNORE THE FACT
THAT I CALLED YOU NERDY

15:02.035 --> 15:04.071
'CAUSE I ALSO
CALLED YOU COOL.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.107
FINE. BUT IF YOU
CALL ME UGLY-PRETTY,

15:07.140 --> 15:09.209
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A PROBLEM.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.245
OH, YOU!

15:14.114 --> 15:15.949
WITH THE FLIP
OF A SWITCH,

15:15.983 --> 15:19.052
I CAN CREATE
A VIRTUAL TRAMPOLINE.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.954
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.056
BAM!

15:33.100 --> 15:36.103
WOW! I DID NOT THINK
THAT WAS GONNA WORK.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.005
COOL.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.240
SO... HOW HIGH
CAN YOU GO?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.275
LET'S FIND OUT.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.214
AAAHHH!

15:47.247 --> 15:49.116
UNH!

15:49.149 --> 15:52.085
UH, WOULD YOU MIND
CARRYING ME OVER

15:52.119 --> 15:54.187
TO THAT GIRL
WHO'S WALKING AWAY
IN DISGUST?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.065
( horse whinnies )

16:08.068 --> 16:10.137
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

16:10.170 --> 16:14.274
WHO WOULD LEAVE
A PERFECTLY GOOD HORSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.144
OKAY, YOU
AND YOUR STOLEN HORSE

16:17.177 --> 16:19.312
NEED TO GET ON
YOUR SIDE OF THE LAB!

16:19.346 --> 16:21.081
CALM DOWN!

16:21.114 --> 16:23.016
WE TRIED TO TAKE
THE ELEVATOR,

16:23.050 --> 16:24.317
BUT HE COULDN'T
PRESS THE BUTTONS
WITH HIS HOOF.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.154
POOR THING DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT
FLOOR WE WERE ON.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.190
He's not the brightest.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.127
IS THAT HORSE
WEARING MY HIGH-TOPS?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.265
WELL, I WASN'T
GONNA LET HIM WALK

16:38.298 --> 16:40.167
ACROSS TOWN
WITH BARE FEET.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.334
I MEAN,
HE'S NOT AN ANIMAL.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.176
( knocking on door )

16:49.209 --> 16:51.178
( deep voice )
UH, SORRY TASHA.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.214
BREE'S NOT HERE.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.116
BREE, IT'S CHASE,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
AND YOUR LAME "MAN VOICE"
DOESN'T FOOL ME.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.323
( sighs )
I CANNOT DEAL
WITH ADAM ANYMORE.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.291
WITHOUT YOU, WE'VE
TURNED ON EACH OTHER.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.327
I NEED YOU TO COME
BACK TO THE LAB

17:07.359 --> 17:09.128
AND BE THE BRUNT
OF OUR PRANKS.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.064
REALLY?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.165
HMM.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.266
HERE'S THE THING:

17:13.300 --> 17:15.367
I CAN'T LEAVE THIS PLACE.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.338
I MEAN, I JUST
LOVE IT UP HERE SO MUCH.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.141
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

17:21.174 --> 17:25.345
WELL, I GUESS
MAYBE I COULD,

17:25.377 --> 17:27.214
AS LONG
AS YOU PROMISE ME

17:27.247 --> 17:28.315
FULL PRIVACY
WHENEVER I ASK FOR IT.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.284
YEAH! LIKE THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.120
HUH.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.188
WAIT!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.158
I HAVE TO MOVE BACK!

17:38.191 --> 17:40.160
I HAVE LESS PRIVACY NOW
THAN I DID BEFORE.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.296
TASHA IS
A SMOTHERING LUNATIC!

17:43.330 --> 17:45.198
SHE STEPPED INSIDE
OF MY CAPSULE!

17:45.232 --> 17:46.333
(I KNOW!)

17:46.366 --> 17:47.400
BOUNDARIES!

17:50.303 --> 17:53.206
THAT HORSE JUST ATE
MY GIANT PLASTIC
CHILI CHEESE DOG,

17:53.240 --> 17:56.243
AND I'M AFRAID TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.146
SEE WHAT I HAVE
TO DEAL WITH?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.248
IF YOU GIVE ME WHAT I WANT,

18:01.281 --> 18:04.184
I CAN TAKE CARE OF
THAT FOR YOU.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.287
OKAY, FINE.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.190
PRIVACY
WHENEVER YOU WANT IT.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.393
ADAM, WE'RE ALL MOVING
BACK DOWN TO THE LAB.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.262
YOU'RE GONNA GET RID
OF THE HORSE,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.196
AND THINGS ARE GONNA GO
BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.399
WHAT? CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW BOSSY SHE IS?

18:19.432 --> 18:22.202
I KNOW.
SHE'S THE WORST.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.238
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST STICK TOGETHER
AND DO WHATEVER SHE SAYS.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.307
OH, YEAH!
THAT'LL SHOW HER!

18:32.245 --> 18:33.413
GUESS WHAT, BREE:

18:33.446 --> 18:35.348
I JUST READ YOUR HOROSCOPE,

18:35.382 --> 18:38.218
AND IT SAYS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
ALONE TONIGHT!

18:38.251 --> 18:41.254
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'M MOVING BACK DOWN
TO THE LAB.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.355
MY BROTHERS NEED ME.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
OH. OKAY.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.160
WELL,
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR...

18:47.194 --> 18:48.461
MIND!

18:51.464 --> 18:53.500
I WONDER WHAT LEO'S UP TO.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.307
OH, HEY, LEO.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.375
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
SHOCKED ME EARLIER?

19:02.409 --> 19:03.476
YEAH, NEITHER DO I,

19:03.510 --> 19:06.479
BECAUSE I PASS OUT
WHEN I'M ELECTROCUTED.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.449
YEAH, WELL,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.318
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AND TRIED TO ADD

19:11.351 --> 19:13.186
A LITTLE DOSE
OF FLASH TO MY NERD,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.355
AND I ENDED UP
IN THE ARMS OF
A LUNCH LADY.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.426
LUCKILY FOR ME,
SHE'S ALSO A RETIRED
PRO WRESTLER.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.397
LEO, LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.433
I-I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.338
( helicopter rotors whirr )

19:37.410 --> 19:40.280
LEO? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.249
YOUR RIDE AWAITS, M'LADY.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.551
NOT YOU!

19:57.430 --> 20:00.267
( rotors whirring )

20:03.503 --> 20:06.306
LEO, THIS IS AMAZING.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.440
AMAZING...

20:07.474 --> 20:10.343
OR JUST ANOTHER THURSDAY?

20:10.377 --> 20:12.379
( laughter )

20:12.412 --> 20:14.547
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE YOUNG
TO BE A PILOT?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.517
PLEASE! MY FIRST
DIAPER WAS A PARACHUTE.

20:17.550 --> 20:21.554
I WENT STRAIGHT
FROM CRYING TO FLYING.

20:21.588 --> 20:25.325
( laughter )
YOU'RE FUNNY.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.526
WELL, IF BY FUNNY,
YOU MEAN--

20:26.559 --> 20:28.361
RIGHT.KILL IT.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.540
CONTROL TOWER,
THIS IS CAPTAIN LEO.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.575
THANKS FOR A GREAT FLIGHT.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.378
NO PROBLEM, LEO.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.447
HEY, EVEN THOUGH
I'M CONTROLLING THIS,

20:47.480 --> 20:49.382
LET'S NOT LET YOUR MOM
KNOW I LET YOU

20:49.416 --> 20:51.418
UP IN A HELICOPTER, OKAY?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.420
COPY THAT.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.555
AND IF YOU'RE
GONNA GET ROMANTIC,

20:55.588 --> 20:58.458
SNAP TO IT. YOU'RE
ALMOST OUT OF GAS.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.768
SO, IMAGINE MY SURPRISE

21:08.801 --> 21:12.639
WHEN THE PLASTIC
CHILI DOG CAME OUT
IN ONE PIECE!

21:14.507 --> 21:16.576
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.579
NOPE. I JUST SMILE
AND NOD UNTIL IT'S OVER.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.748
( elevator bell dings )

21:24.617 --> 21:26.586
GOOD BOY!

21:26.619 --> 21:29.722
YOU LEARNED TO PUSH
THE BUTTONS!

21:29.756 --> 21:32.559
NOW LET'S GO GET CHASE
IN HERE, AND WE'LL
HIT EVERY FLOOR.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.761
DOWN, PLEASE.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.632
HUH. NICE HORSE.
