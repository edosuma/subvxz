WEBVTT

00:23.823 --> 00:25.124
D'oh!

00:25.126 --> 00:26.358
(tires screeching)

00:26.360 --> 00:28.193
(grunts)

00:29.796 --> 00:31.030
(screams)

00:31.032 --> 00:32.264
(door slams)

00:38.805 --> 00:40.639
(laughs)

00:40.641 --> 00:41.907
(whistle blows, crowd cheers
on TV)

00:45.178 --> 00:48.047
(retches, groans)

00:53.019 --> 00:54.453
(laughs)

01:03.163 --> 01:06.432
(groaning, grunting)

01:10.737 --> 01:13.005
(Bart laughs)

01:13.007 --> 01:15.507
Well, it wasn't easy,
but we managed to watch

01:15.509 --> 01:18.043
every "testicle fail"
video on the Internet.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.345
Now to leave a great comment.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.214
LOL.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.716
That's gotta hurt.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.885
Oh... I guess there's
nothing left to do

01:26.887 --> 01:28.387
but go outside and play.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.355
Wait-- a sponsored link.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.857
MILHOUSE: Ooh!

01:31.859 --> 01:33.859
A trailer for
<i>Project: After Party.</i>

01:33.861 --> 01:37.262
The long-awaited sequel
to <i>Project: Party.</i>

01:37.264 --> 01:40.032
(gasps)
That's a red band trailer.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.034
We're not old enough
to see that.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.403
Sure we are. I just have
to enter my birthday.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.272
January 1, 1900.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.075
No movie's so dirty the oldest
man in the world can't see it.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.911
Well, they did everything
they could to stop us,

01:52.913 --> 01:55.547
but we hacked through anyway.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.383
NARRATOR: <i>They thought the party</i>
<i>was over.</i>

01:58.385 --> 02:00.552
After party!

02:00.554 --> 02:02.621
♪

02:10.797 --> 02:12.564
(gasps)
(gasps)

02:12.566 --> 02:15.968
Brief nudity!

02:21.407 --> 02:23.642
I thought we installed
parental blocking software

02:23.644 --> 02:25.077
on all our computers.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.745
I don't know
what that stuff blocks.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.814
Mammogram appointment.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.616
(alarm blares)

02:30.618 --> 02:33.285
I told you
to clean your room

02:33.287 --> 02:35.954
and instead you're
watching chest videos.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.290
Look at all those bowls
of half-eaten cereal.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.592
The cereal on the
bottom gets soggy.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.495
I know how cereal works.
Now clean your room.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.998
Why should I?
It's just gonna get dirty again.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.467
I'm in charge.
You do what I say.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.936
I'll get to it
when I get to it.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.506
That better not mean
what it means when I say it.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.141
(squishing)

02:56.143 --> 02:58.844
D'oh!

03:00.113 --> 03:02.848
That boy has no respect
for my authority.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.450
Maybe you two are more similar
than you'd like to admit.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.818
We're not similar.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.954
I love being told
what to do by someone

03:08.956 --> 03:11.957
who's wise in the ways
of the world. Love it!

03:11.959 --> 03:14.293
Here's what I would do:
in the middle of the night,

03:14.295 --> 03:16.161
clean Bart's room for him,

03:16.163 --> 03:19.498
then, in the morning,
thank him for cleaning his room.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.966
You poor woman.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.201
Dealing with Bart

03:22.203 --> 03:23.835
has turned your mind
to ketchup water.

03:23.837 --> 03:28.073
You rest.
I'll be the boy's father now.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.310
I'm done.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.979
I'd like it if you ate
a little more broccoli.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.814
Eh, I'm not feelin' it.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.816
Your mother said
eat your broccoli.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.651
Why do I need
to eat broccoli?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.654
So that you can grow up
healthy and strong, like...

03:42.656 --> 03:45.657
Randy Quaid.
Yeah, Randy Quaid.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.992
He's very healthy.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.294
Look, I'll drink
another glass of milk.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.497
(scoffs)
Milk. That's for babies

03:52.499 --> 03:54.166
and old guys who can't
sleep at night

03:54.168 --> 03:55.834
because of what they did
in the war.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.035
Broccoli.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.538
Hey, what if I eat
the broccoli?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.873
I love the stuff.
(chuckles)

04:01.875 --> 04:04.376
You eat a sundae.
Marge, get Lisa a sundae.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.178
You are not
leaving this table

04:06.180 --> 04:07.846
until you eat
that broccoli.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.350
And I'm going to sit
right here until you do.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.352
(scoffs)
You'll never out-sit me.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.887
Oh, really? You think
your skinny butt

04:15.889 --> 04:19.191
can sit on that hard,
wooden chair longer than

04:19.193 --> 04:20.692
El Gordo?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.561
(gasps)

04:22.563 --> 04:25.764
The sit is on.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.535
Eat your broccoli.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.737
No.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.438
Eat your broccoli.
No.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.707
(snoring)
(alarm rings)

04:35.709 --> 04:36.942
Read your broccoli.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.443
No.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.280
They've been
at it all night.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.748
I know, but
they're not gonna

04:42.750 --> 04:45.083
waste a whole
Saturday inside.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.385
(phone rings)

04:46.387 --> 04:47.919
Mm-hmm?

04:47.921 --> 04:50.122
Homer, where are you?
Our fantasy football draft

04:50.124 --> 04:51.723
is about to start.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.592
(gasps)
Today's our draft.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.294
I've got to pick
a good fantasy team.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.762
When I lost last year,

04:56.764 --> 04:59.798
they made me do something
so humiliating...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.366
Jeebus loves Tebow.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.468
(Homer whimpers)

05:03.470 --> 05:05.937
And so the fat man caves.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.574
If you need me, I'll be up
in my room eating cereal.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.778
Half a bowl of cereal.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.780
Marge, I want you--

05:14.782 --> 05:18.483
my wife-- to draft
my fantasy football team.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.751
(all gasp)

05:19.753 --> 05:20.986
I-I don't really

05:20.988 --> 05:22.754
know that much about the...

05:22.756 --> 05:26.158
My team name is
"Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe"

05:26.160 --> 05:28.927
and my password
is "Annoyed Grunt."

05:28.929 --> 05:30.929
Draft with God, honey.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.332
Eat your broccoli.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.804
(panting)
Martin's been secretly

05:38.806 --> 05:40.439
taking self-defense
courses,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.808
and now he's
beating up Nelson.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.943
MARTIN: Hi-yah!
NELSON: Ow. Ow. Whoa. Aah!

05:44.945 --> 05:47.279
His fat fists
are a blur.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.681
I've never seen
moves like that.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.450
KEARNEY:
And never will again.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.819
Sounds like quite a match.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.122
And here's your ticket
to a front-row seat.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.490
No. No.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.126
I'll never eat those
filthy mini-trees.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.296
Today, I wear the vest.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.797
Haw. Haw.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.966
(groans)

06:07.968 --> 06:11.169
Now I am never eating
that broccoli.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.306
Homie. Homie,
the fantasy draft just ended.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.475
I got you five kickers.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.177
It is called football, right?

06:19.179 --> 06:23.281
You are definitely
eating that broccoli.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.723
(Homer and Bart growling)

06:34.060 --> 06:36.061
This has got to stop.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.697
If you don't go to work,
you're going to get fired.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.866
I can get another job.
Who wouldn't want to hire

06:40.868 --> 06:42.501
a man who won't back down?

06:42.503 --> 06:44.069
I could be a prison warden

06:44.071 --> 06:45.670
or a Southern anything.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.372
I've got an idea,

06:47.374 --> 06:49.007
but I'll need
that broccoli.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.342
(blender whirrs)

06:50.344 --> 06:51.676
These two fruit smoothies

06:51.678 --> 06:54.012
look and taste exactly the same.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.182
One of them, however,
has the broccoli blended in.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.885
Bart picks one of the smoothies
and drinks it--

06:59.887 --> 07:01.753
maybe he had the broccoli,
maybe he didn't.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.689
No one knows,
so neither of you has given in,

07:04.691 --> 07:07.526
and this horrible impasse
can come to an end.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.027
Uh, works for me.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.195
I'm in.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.431
Oh, thank God.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.266
Hmm...

07:18.371 --> 07:20.705
Oh, no, the broccoli.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.707
(annoyed grunt)
You did that on purpose!

07:22.709 --> 07:24.943
You lick this table clean!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.878
Come on. Lick it.
(grunting)

07:26.880 --> 07:28.380
(both grunting, groaning)

07:28.382 --> 07:29.614
(both grunting)

07:29.616 --> 07:31.883
Come on, now,
you can still lick it.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.719
Oh, I'm afraid Homer
and Bart's problems

07:34.721 --> 07:37.589
are beyond our power to solve.

07:37.591 --> 07:41.393
There's only one thing
left to try.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.628
(snoring)

07:45.398 --> 07:47.299
(snoring)

07:47.301 --> 07:49.534
(both grunt)

07:51.070 --> 07:53.205
(all grunt)

07:54.440 --> 07:56.074
(whispers):
And, lift.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.478
Put my sack back on.
I'm trying to sleep.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.415
(both snoring)

08:03.417 --> 08:04.916
(grunts)

08:04.918 --> 08:06.318
Hmm?

08:07.587 --> 08:08.854
(gasps)
(gasps)

08:12.091 --> 08:13.291
Where are we?

08:13.293 --> 08:15.427
I don't know.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.329
Eat your broccoli.
No.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.438
We're on an old-time boat.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.939
We've been kidnapped.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.475
(chuckles):
Not kidnapped, shanghaied.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.943
Oh.
Oh.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.112
My name is
Captain Bowditch.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.448
Your wife signed you up
for a week at sea,

08:36.450 --> 08:39.117
where you'll live like sailors,
eat like sailors

08:39.119 --> 08:43.121
and use therapeutic techniques
to solve father-son conflicts...

08:43.123 --> 08:44.689
like sailors.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.359
Hmm?
Hmm?

08:47.361 --> 08:48.793
For there's no
better place

08:48.795 --> 08:51.663
to solve relationship
issues than on...

08:51.665 --> 08:53.465
<i>The Relation Ship.</i>

08:53.467 --> 08:55.867
<i>"Relation Ship."</i>

08:55.869 --> 08:58.203
It works two ways.
(laughs)

08:58.205 --> 09:00.038
Pretty good.
(laughs)

09:00.040 --> 09:01.540
Pretty good.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.174
Hey, lame ass,

09:03.176 --> 09:05.677
Thanks to you, we're stuck
on a stupid therapy boat.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.978
I'm the lame ass?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.346
The only lame ass on this boat

09:08.348 --> 09:10.715
is you and all
the other lame asses!

09:11.984 --> 09:13.585
(both grunting, groaning)

09:14.487 --> 09:16.187
Shouldn't we
do something?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.522
We are doing
something.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.624
We're empathizing.

09:21.827 --> 09:25.830
I just know Bart and Homer
are best friends already.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.666
I can feel it.
(computer dings)

09:27.668 --> 09:29.501
Ooh, I'm getting a message
from your father's

09:29.503 --> 09:31.036
fantasy football league.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.405
I must
still be logged in as him.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.676
Lenny used the "uck" word.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.344
Mom, it's trash talk.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.013
You know how guys say
mean things to their friends,

09:42.015 --> 09:45.083
the way women say nice things
to their enemies.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.153
Oh.
(computer dings)

09:54.026 --> 09:55.260
Yikes!

09:55.262 --> 09:58.229
Well I don't like
this trash talk.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.198
And I'm gonna
do something about it.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.068
Even if I have to bring in
the big guns.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.404
Dear Lord, please help Homer's
friends understand

10:06.406 --> 10:09.708
that make-believe
computer football is no excuse

10:09.710 --> 10:12.210
for using the Internet
to be mean.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.179
(phone buzzes)

10:19.452 --> 10:21.620
(gasps)
Trash talk?

10:21.622 --> 10:24.089
In church? No.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.457
No, not here.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.225
(phones buzzing)

10:27.227 --> 10:29.928
MARGE (gasps):
It's everywhere.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.796
And now, a moment of silence

10:31.798 --> 10:35.900
for the victims
of the Shelbyville sinkhole.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.736
(phone buzzes)

10:37.738 --> 10:39.437
(Marge gasps)

10:39.439 --> 10:43.308
The Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi.
I've got to take out The Wi-Fi.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.315
She's under a lot of stress.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.250
Her husband's at sea.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.552
(bell dinging)

10:55.421 --> 10:57.122
Ahoy, lads and dads.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.823
It's never easy to talk about

10:58.825 --> 11:01.092
your feelings
in front of strangers...

11:01.094 --> 11:03.428
so we're going to sing
about them.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.764
♪ Who wants to sing
about their feelings ♪

11:05.766 --> 11:08.266
♪ Who wants to go first
and sing about their feelings ♪

11:08.268 --> 11:10.435
♪ I'll go first
and sing about my feelings ♪

11:10.437 --> 11:13.438
♪ I'm so happy to be singing.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.439
Now, Homer.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.674
D'oh!

11:18.310 --> 11:20.278
So, Cletus, Gitmo,

11:20.280 --> 11:23.348
what brings you fellas
to <i>The Relation Ship?</i>

11:23.350 --> 11:25.784
My daddy's
always overpraisin' me.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.619
Aw, that's great honesty, son.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.454
I'm so proud of you.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.290
(scoffs)
Why won't you let me fail?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.293
What about you,
Bart, Homer? Homer?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.162
Lethargy, skin spots,

11:37.164 --> 11:40.498
spongy gums--
this man's got scurvy.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.867
But we've only been
at sea one day.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.470
When's the last time
you had citrus?

11:45.472 --> 11:48.640
I had a mimosa
at brunch a few years ago.

11:48.642 --> 11:51.543
Well, Bart, while your father
spends the next few days

11:51.545 --> 11:53.645
sucking out of
the lemon barrel,

11:53.647 --> 11:57.549
you'll drink deep of the
hearty grog of empowerment.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.817
What does that mean?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.652
Mainly climbing.

12:00.654 --> 12:04.055
Except for Wednesday night when
we project a movie on the sails.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.524
But, really,
a lot of climbing.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.728
(Gilbert and Sullivan's "We Sail
the Ocean Blue" playing)

12:40.025 --> 12:42.727
Sheepshank, bowline,
clove hitch...

12:42.729 --> 12:44.362
(Homer sucking)

12:44.364 --> 12:47.365
Dad, look, I did a round turn
with two half hitches.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.200
You lie!

12:49.202 --> 12:50.034
(gasps)

12:50.036 --> 12:51.069
Wait a minute.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.704
Windswept hair, rugged tan,

12:52.706 --> 12:54.239
rough, calloused hands.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.207
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?!

12:56.209 --> 12:59.377
So what if I am?
You're my son and you
will hate what I hate.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.246
Angled parking. Lemons.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.382
Kickstarters by famous guys
who already have lots of money.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.050
And this boat!

13:06.052 --> 13:08.553
I'm old enough to choose
my own things to hate.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.754
And the things I like.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.923
And I like being a sailor.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.292
Betrayed by my worst enemy.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.628
I never would have seen it
coming.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.931
Why, Bart,
that's a perfect halyard cleat.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.733
Just like you taught me,
Captain.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.736
Over, under, over, under, over,
under, under, under, over, over,

13:24.738 --> 13:27.305
over, over, over, over, over,
under, over, half hitch.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.307
Well, the standard form
is under, over, under, over,

13:29.309 --> 13:30.809
under, under, under,
under, under,

13:30.811 --> 13:32.744
over, over,
under, under, under, under,

13:32.746 --> 13:34.245
around, over, over, under...

13:34.247 --> 13:35.914
Fathers, sons,

13:35.916 --> 13:39.117
together we've made a lot of
progress on this voyage.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.119
I learned
that left is called "port."

13:41.121 --> 13:43.755
I finally got over
my sea sickness.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.423
(retches)

13:45.425 --> 13:47.659
Terrific, Homer. Just terrific.

13:47.661 --> 13:51.462
But one sailor has truly taken
to nautical life.

13:51.464 --> 13:55.967
I hereby award Bart Simpson
the post of midshipman.

13:55.969 --> 13:56.935
(spits)

13:56.937 --> 13:58.603
Wow.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.471
So now I can give orders?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.307
That's right,
Mr. Midshipman.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.309
Wait a minute.
I'm his father.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.444
He can't order
me around.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.779
He's your superior officer,

14:07.781 --> 14:10.615
so he can and will order
you around.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.284
And what if I refuse?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.619
Oh...!

14:14.621 --> 14:16.788
I'm sorry we had
to discipline you.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.489
On the positive side,
you won't miss out

14:18.491 --> 14:21.125
on the father/son
hornpipe dance.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.862
(playing accordion)

14:24.830 --> 14:28.867
Oh, I hate
the Golden Age of Sail.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.141
(whistles)

14:37.143 --> 14:39.210
Officer on deck!

14:41.180 --> 14:44.649
Seaman Homer, you're supposed
to be swabbing the deck.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.517
Why should I?
It's just gonna get dirty again.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.653
I'm in charge.
You do what I say.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.989
Fine. I'll swab
whatever you say.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.358
Look! I'm swabbing the deck.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.395
I'm swabbing this giant tree
that the sail grows out of.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.831
Ooh! I'm swabbing
the top of the ocean.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.667
Ooh! Swab, swab, swab...

15:02.669 --> 15:05.003
Hey! What the...?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.672
Fantasy football has turned
every man in this town

15:07.674 --> 15:10.341
into a trash-talking monster.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.678
Oh, face it-- all men
live in a sad world

15:13.680 --> 15:18.583
of profanity, boob jokes and
tired comedy references.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.019
<i>Más</i> cowbell!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.587
(laughter)

15:22.589 --> 15:25.089
There's only one thing that
will shut these guys up.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.226
You got to beat one of
them at fantasy football.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.862
(dramatic, epic sports
theme music playing)

15:30.864 --> 15:33.765
Then that's what I'm gonna do.

<i>undefeated trash-talker</i>

15:47.948 --> 15:49.948
Mom did everything:
she checked injury lists,

15:49.950 --> 15:52.583
scouting reports,
she even studied the tapes.

15:52.585 --> 15:56.054
<i>The tapes of</i> The Real
Housewives of Tampa Bay,

15:56.056 --> 15:58.623
<i>where she watched star running</i>

<i>get kicked out of his house</i>

16:00.393 --> 16:03.461

16:03.463 --> 16:06.564
That doesn't match my phone!

16:06.566 --> 16:08.633
Lakwando's mind
won't be on the game.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.068
And...

16:10.070 --> 16:11.636
benched.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.405
And now to make my big move.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.241
Homer's team e-mailed asking
to start five kickers.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.911
I was like, "Okay,
it's, uh, your funeral."

16:19.913 --> 16:22.480
<i>There would be no funeral.</i>

16:22.482 --> 16:26.951
<i>High winds, unlocked by the</i>
<i>savage power of climate change,</i>

16:26.953 --> 16:31.089

<i>of three-point annihilation.</i>

16:34.260 --> 16:36.127
An 85-yard field goal?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.429
You got to be kidding me!
Refresh, refresh.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.333

16:57.816 --> 16:59.617

I hope your voyage

17:01.988 --> 17:04.822

when someone
doesn't respect your authority.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.795
Epiphany ho.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.831
And I'm sure your father

You don't need booze, Homer.

17:29.182 --> 17:33.017
I went to sea because
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.853
But out here on the waves,
I no longer crave

17:35.855 --> 17:39.690

Now I'm the ship's
highest-ranking officer.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.652
It's up to me
to get us to shore.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.990
Dad, we can make it
to harbor

19:18.992 --> 19:21.659
if we can just sail
around that lighthouse.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.594
Are you crazy?
We'll never make it!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.930
Drop the anchor
and wait out the storm!

19:25.932 --> 19:27.932
No, we need to sail.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.467
I'm dropping the anchor!

19:29.469 --> 19:31.135
Can't you just do what I say?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.604
You've never done
what I say-- ever!
