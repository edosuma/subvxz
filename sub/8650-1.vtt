WEBVTT

01:56.657 --> 01:57.992
Shit.

01:58.659 --> 01:59.785
Hang in there, man.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.338
Lighten up, McNally. It's only a game.

02:21.682 --> 02:24.101
Hey, man, believe it or not,
you made the starting line-up.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.353
No shit?

02:25.436 --> 02:27.021
Yeah, Andrews has the chicken pox.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.607
You're good for two games, at least.

02:29.690 --> 02:31.025
Well, that's great.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.653
If you don't like it, why do you do it?

02:35.738 --> 02:37.406
Baseball's my life.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.867
Jomo. Jomo! Come here.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.161
Come here.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.329
Now, listen, Jomo.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.790
I want you to take this to Harry, all right?

04:50.998 --> 04:53.751
Take it to Harry! Come on!
Take it to Harry! Take it to Harry!

04:53.835 --> 04:54.877
Go on! Take it to Harry!

04:55.336 --> 04:56.379
Take it to Harry!

04:56.921 --> 04:59.340
Go on! Go on, Jomo!

05:20.069 --> 05:21.195
Jomo! Jomo!

05:22.822 --> 05:23.865
Come on! Come on!

05:26.701 --> 05:27.869
Get down! Get down!

05:37.712 --> 05:38.754
All right, come on.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.224
-I still think you should go.
-No, I can't get off from work.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.561
But you're the only one that knows all
those statistics. I can't remember nothing.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.771
My brain's a sieve.
How do you learn it all that stuff?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.274
It's in the government reports.
It's in the library.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.942
You think they'll really listen to us?

06:00.193 --> 06:03.404
Well, if they don't, there's going to be
1,500 barrels of radioactive waste...

06:03.487 --> 06:04.530
buried just a few miles from here...

06:04.614 --> 06:06.741
and you might have grandchildren
with three heads.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.035
Now, look, I'm going to rehearse you.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.412
And there's a delegation
from Point Arena going, too.

06:11.495 --> 06:13.247
Jerry Baker. He's very good on his feet.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.916
And Joe will be there.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.460
Look, I got to go. I'll miss my ride. Okay?

06:17.835 --> 06:21.380
Martha, remember the study group's
at my place on Thursday.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.507
Okay!

06:23.132 --> 06:24.175
How did it go?

06:24.258 --> 06:26.052
They wanted me to go to Tallahassee
and lobby.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.678
I talked them into sending Joe and Paula.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.888
Joe and Paula?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.723
It's okay. They'll be all right.

06:30.806 --> 06:34.560
The nerve those assholes have,
putting that shit near human beings.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.979
Let's blow this pop stand. I'm starving.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.187
We got shoes, two cars, four feds.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.831
Mom, there's Jomo.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.042
You two,
get out of your jeans and into bed.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.169
What's gonna happen to her?

08:23.544 --> 08:26.214
-Someone will take her home.
-We never had to leave her before.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.340
Sorry, kid.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.675
-He got to keep that.
-I thought I told you to get in to bed.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.344
-It's morning.
-Get into bed!

08:34.055 --> 08:35.890
I'm going to wash my hair.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.359
Who's this?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.278
Mom and Dad. Who do you think?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.947
You're kidding.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.034
"Arthur and Annie Pope
continue to elude capture...

08:55.535 --> 08:58.371
"despite sightings of the couple,
who went underground...

08:58.454 --> 09:02.625
"after claiming responsibility
for the 1971 bombing...

09:02.708 --> 09:06.045
"of the University of Massachusetts
military research lab."

09:07.797 --> 09:09.382
What does "elude" mean?

09:09.465 --> 09:10.967
Not getting caught.

09:11.259 --> 09:15.346
"The laboratory is credited
with the development of napalm...

09:15.638 --> 09:18.975
"used extensively in the Vietnam War."

09:19.684 --> 09:21.102
Why did they have to blow it up?

09:21.185 --> 09:24.021
They didn't stop making it
when they asked them politely.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.065
Come on, Danny, I'm serious!

09:27.733 --> 09:29.569
They were dropping that stuff on people.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.409
"Annie Pope is the former
Anne Patterson...

09:36.492 --> 09:41.164
"daughter of Donald Patterson,
president of American Telekinetics."

09:42.331 --> 09:44.041
Is this Grandpa?

09:50.047 --> 09:52.341
-It must be.
-And Grandma?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.635
Yeah.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.638
Do you remember them?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.893
-No.
-Not even a little?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.314
They look kind of uptight.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.445
-Industrial waste all around.
-Rad!

10:12.528 --> 10:15.698
Get them while they're hot.
Get them before they rot.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.536
-Where's your mother?
-She's in the shower.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.168
I talked this morning with some of the
people who knew the Pope family best.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.337
John Kungle played ball
with the young man...

10:29.420 --> 10:32.340
who was known here in Florida City
as Richard McNally.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.468
He was a good student, and a good friend?

10:35.718 --> 10:37.011
He was a cool dude.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.847
That's how legends are made.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.933
What's his IQ? 49?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.894
-He's going to UCLA.
-No kidding?

10:45.186 --> 10:48.189
No, I'm not kidding.
I said, he's going to UCLA.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.607
Excuse me.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.193
These photos of the couple
are 20 years old...

10:52.276 --> 10:54.237
and are not considered too reliable.

10:54.362 --> 10:58.866
The couple is still wanted for the
1971 bombing of their university lab...

10:58.950 --> 11:00.785
in which a janitor was blinded.

11:00.868 --> 11:04.789
FBI officials in Miami said that despite
the presence of their two children...

11:04.872 --> 11:08.376
the Popes should be considered
as possibly armed and dangerous.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.336
In further local news....

11:11.796 --> 11:13.381
There's food for you.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.924
You look pretty, Mom.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.676
Get into bed, Kimosabe.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.937
Okay, let's see.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.275
Blue eyes, blond hair. You're okay.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.654
Or are you?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.573
What's the matter, kid?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.119
I don't know.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.331
I just feel kind of lousy, you know?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.458
You're supposed to feel that way at 17.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.668
Really?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.463
It's terrific not recognizing yourself
when you look in the mirror.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.300
It's wonderful having a new name
every six months.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.596
We were there a long time.
It's hard to leave.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.183
We may have to cut your hair, too.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.106
Maybe this time I could shave my head.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.570
-Send your brother in.
-Yeah.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.991
I hate this.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.082
The Phillies won again last night.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.919
Things are looking good, then.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.962
Things are looking great.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.343
The MacArthur feud with Truman.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.929
I don't think we covered that
in the local paper.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.181
Maybe you better try The Washingtonian.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.643
No, I'm interested in how it affected
the heartland of the nation...

12:48.726 --> 12:49.977
the small communities.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.232
-This is social history.
-I could show you The Eagle.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.735
We just put our back issues on microfilm.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.741
-This is it?
-Take it right over there.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.867
Thank you.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.696
St. Martin's Hospital, Medical Records.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.158
-Three dollars?
-Yes.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.120
Where do you want it mailed,
Mr. Mansfield?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.371
Manfield.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.248
No, I'll pick it up.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.251
I need to get a passport.
The company's sending me to Cairo.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.919
-Are you in oil?
-Military.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.091
You're listening to your favorite
oldies station in Norfolk, Virginia....

14:10.725 --> 14:13.561
Ralph, the cat needs to be fed.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.348
Need anything else?

15:32.431 --> 15:35.768
-No. I'll call the booth again in two weeks.
-Okay.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.646
Listen, your mother....

15:39.730 --> 15:42.608
She died four weeks ago. Cancer.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.194
Your father was with her.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.280
You were just too hot to contact.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.367
He said to tell you not to worry about him.
He's okay.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.202
Sorry.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.837
Okay, who wants lunch?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.088
Me.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.675
How's tuna?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.427
Yecch.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.224
There's a kid in my class who traded me
Duke Snider for Valenzuela.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.934
Yeah, so?

16:58.684 --> 17:00.228
So, he's a jerk.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.356
Snider's worth about $20.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.067
He's from the Brooklyn Dodgers.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.152
He's old.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.157
This card is an antique.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.165
-Can I have white bread?
-Just eat it.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.251
Hey, kid.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.419
You. What's your name?

17:25.670 --> 17:26.838
Michael.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.675
-Why are you asking him that?
-He's not used to it yet.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.136
He better get used to it fast.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.139
What's my name?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.935
-Paul.
-Paul what?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.437
-Paul Manfield.
-Spell it.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.859
M-A-N...

17:49.068 --> 17:53.698
F-I-E-L-D.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.241
-What's your mother's name?
-Just stop it.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.367
I'm waiting.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.994
Cynthia.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.245
And your brother?

17:59.829 --> 18:01.164
Stephen, all right?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.837
What the hell's your problem?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.755
I got some clothes in the city.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.343
You can wear the thrift shop ones.
The new ones...

18:14.844 --> 18:16.512
have to be washed first.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.598
Yes, sir!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.447
Sorry about this afternoon.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.960
Sophie's dead.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.673
What?

18:53.090 --> 18:56.302
A month ago. The big "C."

19:01.557 --> 19:02.600
Oh, babe.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.606
I talked to her after the feds came,
to tell her we were okay.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.193
She never let on.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.448
I can just see her
standing there with Morris.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.284
Two fat old Jews, ex-Bolsheviks...

19:20.451 --> 19:24.288
talking to their red-diaper baby
on a phone from a Laundromat...

19:24.497 --> 19:26.457
and she's fucking dying.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.005
That lady loved me.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.010
Last winter, when they arranged
for her to meet me in Chicago...

19:38.344 --> 19:41.013
she flew there on an hour's notice...

19:41.430 --> 19:43.766
alone, in a blizzard.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.269
She's terrified of flying.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.938
She was green when she got off the plane.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.941
I took her over to the lounge to talk...

19:52.108 --> 19:56.445
and we sat in a corner and I said,
"I wish it was easier."

19:57.280 --> 20:00.783
"You wish it were easier," she says.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.453
She's correcting my grammar...

20:04.787 --> 20:07.290
like I'm one of the kids she teaches.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.089
There's nothing left to go back to now.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.302
There's only us and the boys.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.304
We're all that's left.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.015
We must....

20:24.807 --> 20:27.310
We have to hang on to each other.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.025
May I see his records?

20:34.108 --> 20:36.194
I'm afraid I lost his records.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.321
They gave them to me,
and I know I packed them...

20:38.404 --> 20:39.906
but I just can't find them.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.825
I'm always losing things, right?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.953
My husband says I'd probably lose
my head if it weren't screwed on.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.289
But I can write for a copy.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.374
Make sure to write for those records,
okay?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.668
You can have two electives.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.880
Music, typing, mechanics, computer
programming, or home economics?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.173
Music.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.301
-And?
-And?

21:03.137 --> 21:05.806
-Home economics.
-His dad's a cook.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.118
Find an empty seat, Mr. Manfield.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.121
All right, listen up, everyone.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.623
Listen again, please.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.666
Now, can anyone tell me the difference
between these two pieces?

22:56.459 --> 22:57.543
Yes?

22:57.627 --> 23:01.297
One is pop and the other is classical.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.343
At least we know you're not deaf.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.304
How about you, Mr. Spaulding?

23:08.846 --> 23:11.182
Could you give us a deeper distinction?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.435
The first one's bad...

23:15.770 --> 23:17.313
and the second one's good.

23:17.772 --> 23:20.650
That's a matter of opinion, not a fact.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.903
I'm sure there are several people in this
room who would disagree with you.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.032
How about you, Mr. Manfield?

23:28.241 --> 23:30.159
Would you care to venture a guess?

23:37.208 --> 23:38.835
You can't dance to Beethoven.

23:44.048 --> 23:47.593
That's very good, Manfield.
Do you listen to much Beethoven?

23:48.803 --> 23:50.054
No, not really.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.139
How did you identify this piece?

23:54.141 --> 23:55.309
I guess I've heard some.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.605
I'm sure the rest of the class
can identify the other composer.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.818
You're quite correct.
You can't dance to Mr. Beethoven.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.279
Can you tell me why, Mr. Manfield?

24:07.989 --> 24:10.241
Because the Beethoven piece...

24:10.324 --> 24:14.579
doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo!

24:19.083 --> 24:21.544
Madonna is 4/4 time all the way through.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.964
The melody changes,
but the rhythm is constant.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.841
So you can dance to it.

24:27.425 --> 24:31.387
The quartet changes
both melodically and rhythmically.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.140
I'm going to play them again.
Listen for this.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.149
Mr. Manfield.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.033
We'll have to find an instrument for you.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.242
An instrument?

24:53.951 --> 24:57.413
Everybody who takes music
is required to play in the orchestra.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.375
Do you play something?

25:01.459 --> 25:02.627
Piano.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.921
Play something.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.971
Well, there's one thing you don't have
to do, and that's play in the orchestra.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.516
I'd like to hear how you sound
on the Steinway I have at home.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.270
Get out of here.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.993
-Get a job, Dad?
-You betcha I did. Right in town.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.913
-I'm a cook. Guess which kind?
-Italian?

27:01.996 --> 27:04.207
-You got it.
-Radical!

27:04.290 --> 27:06.209
Do you have to say that?

27:08.794 --> 27:11.464
-Where'd you get this?
-Public library lost and found.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.174
It's right around the corner
from the restaurant.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.594
April can be cold up here.
I thought you might need these.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.263
Keep those slugger hands from cracking.

27:19.347 --> 27:21.015
-Did you make the team?
-Yeah.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.267
-Great.
-What about me?

27:23.351 --> 27:26.979
Sorry, kid. Nothing in your size. Have to
try a movie theater on the weekend.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.565
Which reminds me, we have to chop
some firewood on Saturday.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.609
Oh, Dad, I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm not going to school.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.819
-How come?
-They're taking class pictures.

27:33.945 --> 27:34.987
Right.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.783
-How is that school?
-Not bad.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.870
-Teachers know anything you don't?
-Yeah, they're okay.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.705
Did you have any trouble
with the registration?

27:44.789 --> 27:46.916
I had to see the guidance counselor
at the end of the day.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.167
And?

27:48.251 --> 27:51.295
He wanted to know
what colleges I was applying to.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.506
What did you tell him?

27:53.589 --> 27:55.591
Well, I said I hadn't decided yet.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.469
Good. Just tell them something,
and forget about it.

27:58.553 --> 28:00.596
Otherwise they'll keep bugging you.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.016
-How about you, small stuff?
-I don't want peppers.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.609
Bless you.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.824
There's a kid in my class
who's really crazy.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.910
You're not exactly the poster child
for mental health.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.580
He knows train schedules.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.498
You never know.
It might have come in handy.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.168
Really, Dad. All over the country.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.963
He knows what time trains leave
from Omaha to Atlanta, Georgia.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.131
Stuff like that.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.758
Get to know this kid.
What are you doing with that safety pin?

28:37.842 --> 28:39.343
What safety pin?

28:43.723 --> 28:45.850
-I got a job.
-Really?

28:46.350 --> 28:47.810
Tell us, my dear.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.938
How are you going to contribute
to this false, capitalist economy?

28:51.731 --> 28:55.234
I'm going to be a receptionist
for a Dr. Milton Cosswell.

28:55.318 --> 28:56.360
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.487
There was a sign up at the post office.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.490
He doesn't mind paying me in cash.

29:01.199 --> 29:02.825
He didn't even ask why.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.745
It's probably good for his taxes,
or something.

29:06.037 --> 29:09.040
Anyway, it means I can pick up supplies,
if we need them.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.502
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.758
Mom, thanks.

29:20.009 --> 29:23.513
Sounds good.
Looks like we all got what we wanted.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.061
Hello, is anyone home?

31:06.908 --> 31:07.950
Hello?

33:07.904 --> 33:09.405
Who are you?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.407
I live here. Who are you?

33:12.825 --> 33:15.328
-Is Mr. Phillips your father?
-Yes.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.538
And is this you in the pink--

33:17.622 --> 33:18.873
I've destroyed the negative.

33:18.956 --> 33:21.751
So now we've determined
that I belong here. Let's talk about you.

33:22.168 --> 33:25.671
Your father said I could use the piano.
And the door was open.

33:25.755 --> 33:28.257
-We do have a bell.
-I rang the bell.

33:28.341 --> 33:31.177
No one answered, so I came in. I'm sorry.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.054
You go to the school?

33:33.304 --> 33:34.388
Yeah.

33:34.472 --> 33:37.725
-I haven't seen you there.
-That's because I just started.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.435
So how come you're not there?

33:40.478 --> 33:43.147
I had a fever last night.
My mom made me stay home.

33:43.231 --> 33:46.817
-Why didn't you?
-I felt better today. And I was bored.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.946
You're strange. I cut.

33:50.071 --> 33:53.074
I didn't feel like having my picture taken
with those subhumans.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.159
You're very good, you know.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.953
I'm okay.

33:57.662 --> 33:59.163
What's your name?

33:59.539 --> 34:01.707
-Michael.
-I'm Lorna.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.709
I'd better be going.

34:03.793 --> 34:06.003
-Where are you from?
-Oakland.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.881
-You born in California?
-No, New York.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.258
Really?

34:10.341 --> 34:13.678
I want to go to school in New York,
but my mother's afraid I'll get mugged.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.222
Your family move around a lot?

34:16.347 --> 34:17.807
No, not really. You play?

34:18.516 --> 34:20.852
God, no. I couldn't stand to practice.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.396
My older brother is the virtuoso.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.233
He's at Yale. He does everything right.
Where are you going?

34:31.821 --> 34:34.657
Oh, that.
I haven't thought about that much.

34:34.907 --> 34:38.744
You haven't though about it much? You're
going to have to apply next semester.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.956
Yeah?

34:42.707 --> 34:44.458
What do you mean, "Yeah?"

34:46.919 --> 34:50.298
Look, I really.... I gotta go.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.426
You're certifiable.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.428
You're welcome.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.812
Mr. Manfield, I'd like a word with you.

35:08.441 --> 35:11.110
I understand you had occasion
to visit my house yesterday.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.696
I went to look at your piano.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.073
I understand you did more than look at it.

35:16.991 --> 35:19.327
-Do you have a piano at home?
-No, sir.

35:20.536 --> 35:21.871
How do you practice?

35:22.580 --> 35:23.915
I can't much.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.460
You're a talented musician, Manfield...

35:27.543 --> 35:29.921
but that doesn't give you the right
to act like a criminal.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.339
Is that clear?

35:32.798 --> 35:33.925
Yes, sir.

35:38.513 --> 35:39.555
Manfield?

35:41.849 --> 35:43.518
We'll find you a piano.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.985
Now let me see, girls.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.951
Thank you. Just go to the back of the line.

36:02.495 --> 36:04.789
You are certifiable.

36:05.581 --> 36:08.584
What is this? Some sort of smart-ass joke?
You're taking cooking?

36:08.668 --> 36:10.002
I want to learn how to cook.

36:10.086 --> 36:13.965
Yeah, right. You have a burning desire
to learn how to make Apple Brown Betty.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.218
What are you doing here,
if you think so highly of it?

36:17.301 --> 36:19.262
They wouldn't let me take
auto mechanics...

36:19.345 --> 36:21.806
and I didn't have time to take the issue
to the Supreme Court.

36:21.889 --> 36:25.434
Now that leaves Phillips and Manfield.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.229
Please, would you take the last booth?

36:30.481 --> 36:32.483
Today's menu...

36:32.984 --> 36:35.945
is tuna-walnut casserole.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.281
This may be auto mechanics after all.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.492
Take your four-cup measuring bowl.

36:41.576 --> 36:44.287
You know, my father thinks
you're the best thing since sliced bread.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.289
That's not what he told me.

36:46.664 --> 36:48.166
A can of tuna.

36:48.541 --> 36:50.376
Listen, don't worry.
Don't let him scare you.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.587
You can do anything
if he thinks you can play music.

36:53.421 --> 36:55.423
Half a cup of walnuts.

36:56.132 --> 36:58.634
We're having
a chamber music concert Saturday.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.137
And they're boring as hell,
you have to dress for a funeral...

37:01.220 --> 37:02.722
but you'd probably like it.
You want to come?

37:02.805 --> 37:04.807
Two stalks of celery.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.644
-Yeah, I've got to think about it. Celery.
-Celery.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.062
Here.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.901
He's getting seduced
by all this bourgeois crap.

37:14.984 --> 37:17.987
-Fucking chamber music.
-It's music, for God's sake.

37:18.070 --> 37:21.073
Decadent, white-skinned, privileged crap.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.911
Lot of people sitting around in ties
and pantyhose in wing chairs...

37:24.994 --> 37:26.996
-like at your mother's house.
-Like at my mother's house.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.414
He's not going.

37:28.873 --> 37:30.917
-Says who?
-Says me!

37:31.000 --> 37:34.337
-I don't believe you.
-Read my lips: He's not going.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.839
Since when did you become
the minister of culture?

37:36.923 --> 37:38.841
You'd let him go
if it was a rock 'n' roll concert.

37:38.925 --> 37:41.093
-That's right! You bet I would. Yes.
-Unbelievable.

37:41.177 --> 37:43.179
Are you out of your mind?

37:43.679 --> 37:47.141
I'm not letting him go
because it's not safe.

37:47.808 --> 37:51.812
He doesn't have to be on display
for the entire community of Waterford.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.441
And because it's not rock and roll.

37:56.818 --> 37:59.612
You think you're cute, Dad,
but you're full of shit.

38:01.155 --> 38:03.282
-Don't talk to me like that.
-Why?

38:03.449 --> 38:05.785
Aren't we supposed to question authority?
You taught me that!

38:05.910 --> 38:07.954
Who do you think you are?
General Patton?

38:08.037 --> 38:11.332
Why is it any more dangerous for me to go
to school than it is to go to the concert?

38:11.415 --> 38:15.002
Because there are 600 other kids
at the school.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.840
Give me a break.

38:19.382 --> 38:20.842
You're not going.

39:47.512 --> 39:49.680
Mr. Manfield!
To what do we owe this pleasure?

39:49.764 --> 39:51.349
Lorna invited me.

39:51.516 --> 39:54.185
She usually doesn't show
such good judgment.

39:54.519 --> 39:57.855
I'm delighted.
There's some people I want you to meet.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.608
Sam, this is Michael Manfield,
the boy I was telling you about.

40:00.691 --> 40:01.734
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hi.

40:01.818 --> 40:04.153
Perhaps we can convince you
to play something for us.

40:04.237 --> 40:06.322
I have nothing prepared.

40:06.405 --> 40:09.408
I heard you working on some Brahms
the other day. It was perfectly lovely.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.285
You can play it
after the second intermission.

40:11.369 --> 40:15.122
I'd like to, but I really have to go
pick up my brother at a friend's house.

40:15.206 --> 40:17.166
You can play before you have to go.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.292
Listen, Dad, would you excuse me?

40:18.376 --> 40:19.585
I'd like to get Michael something to eat.

40:19.669 --> 40:22.046
-Hope to hear you soon.
-It was really good stuff.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.390
How come you didn't want
to play for them?

40:33.683 --> 40:37.520
Personally, I wouldn't consider it,
but you're supposed to love this stuff.

40:40.189 --> 40:44.068
It's all right. You don't have to explain.
Mozart was crazy, too.

40:46.737 --> 40:49.031
-Want to go up to my room?
-Okay.

40:49.907 --> 40:52.076
All right. Finish your milk.

41:13.181 --> 41:14.682
Excuse me.

41:17.226 --> 41:19.061
Guitar is my life.

41:28.404 --> 41:30.740
You're very confusing, you know.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.910
Who, me? Why?

41:34.577 --> 41:36.162
'Cause sometimes you can be so straight...

41:36.245 --> 41:38.581
and then other times,
you turn around and you're like that.

41:44.462 --> 41:47.507
-It's always, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir."
-I'm polite.

41:47.757 --> 41:49.967
-Polite is phony.
-It's not phony.

41:51.886 --> 41:55.014
-It avoids confrontation.
-Is that what you're doing now?

41:55.097 --> 41:57.099
You're avoiding confrontation?

41:57.308 --> 41:59.435
Don't you ever want to say, "Cut the shit"?

41:59.560 --> 42:02.480
Lorna! Is Michael in there with you?
I want him to play.

42:05.149 --> 42:07.944
He left. He went to pick up his brother.

42:08.444 --> 42:10.488
I thought this was my room.

42:12.323 --> 42:14.575
Your mother wants you downstairs.

42:26.420 --> 42:27.713
There's a tree.

43:17.096 --> 43:19.599
Mrs. Powell? The doctor will see you now.

43:24.437 --> 43:26.772
Did I leave my purse out here?

43:29.150 --> 43:30.193
Thank you.

43:33.446 --> 43:34.780
Excuse me?

43:35.448 --> 43:36.491
Excuse me!

43:37.533 --> 43:39.160
Do you have an appointment?

43:41.454 --> 43:42.705
Nope.

43:55.468 --> 43:56.802
Gus!

43:59.138 --> 44:01.098
What's cooking, mama?

44:02.725 --> 44:06.145
I look at you, and I can see you standing
on the corner of Michigan Avenue...

44:06.938 --> 44:10.066
in a Mexican blouse
and those crazy silver things.

44:10.274 --> 44:12.068
Big silver earrings.

44:13.110 --> 44:15.112
God, that was a long time ago.

44:16.572 --> 44:17.907
How's Artie?

44:18.783 --> 44:20.117
He's okay.

44:20.952 --> 44:22.954
He's great, actually.

44:23.955 --> 44:27.291
He did some work in Florida
on a toxic waste dump.

44:27.750 --> 44:30.503
Here, he organized a food co-op...

44:30.586 --> 44:32.463
and he's trying to
get his restaurant to unionize.

44:32.547 --> 44:34.715
And how's you and Artie?

44:35.466 --> 44:36.801
We're okay.

44:37.718 --> 44:41.472
I mean, you know, it's hard.

44:41.556 --> 44:43.057
I think about you.

44:44.976 --> 44:46.477
I think about you.

44:49.063 --> 44:50.648
I hope you're safe.

44:52.942 --> 44:54.777
How do you manage this?

44:55.069 --> 44:56.404
Got a house...

44:56.904 --> 44:58.239
two kids.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.784
It's kind of like
you're leading a regular life.

45:02.702 --> 45:04.203
I'm a good liar.

45:05.705 --> 45:07.331
But I'm tired.

45:10.418 --> 45:11.919
Shit.

45:19.051 --> 45:20.094
Oh, God.

45:27.977 --> 45:29.020
Hey, chief.

45:30.855 --> 45:31.898
Hello.

45:33.065 --> 45:34.400
Hello?

45:34.984 --> 45:37.487
That's all you got to say to this guy
that just drove...

45:37.570 --> 45:40.114
800 miles out of his way to see you?

45:40.656 --> 45:41.991
You look great.

45:42.074 --> 45:43.910
Then how come I feel so uneasy?

45:44.076 --> 45:47.371
Artie, let's take a walk.
I got stuff to talk to you about.

45:47.455 --> 45:48.539
I'm tired.

45:48.623 --> 45:52.293
Go ahead, Paul. Take a walk with him.
You haven't seen him for 12 years.

46:06.891 --> 46:08.726
You're out of your fucking mind!

46:08.809 --> 46:11.812
-You owe us!
-I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

46:12.063 --> 46:14.732
Do you know what
your asshole friend here wants me to do?

46:15.066 --> 46:19.028
Rob a fucking bank! Can you believe it?
A fucking bank!

46:20.154 --> 46:22.406
A "political action," he calls it.

46:22.657 --> 46:25.618
We've been assigned this little job
by the Liberation Army.

46:25.701 --> 46:28.579
Who are under the mistaken impression
that they've been supporting us...

46:28.663 --> 46:30.331
and we owe them something!

46:31.332 --> 46:33.417
What do they want my kids to do?

46:33.501 --> 46:35.878
Knock off the fucking president?

46:36.712 --> 46:38.756
You want to show
what you got in your car?

46:39.882 --> 46:42.009
Nothing. It's my stuff.

46:42.343 --> 46:44.554
That's not the impression you gave me.

46:45.012 --> 46:47.348
Let's look, shall we?

46:48.057 --> 46:49.684
Get the kids down here.
I want them to see this.

46:49.767 --> 46:51.727
This guy's still a fucking maniac!

46:51.811 --> 46:52.854
Just stop it.

46:52.937 --> 46:56.023
Boys! Get down here! Now!

47:18.754 --> 47:22.758
I want you to know
guns are not what we're about.

47:27.013 --> 47:28.639
Now, get back in the house.

47:39.317 --> 47:41.444
You're going to change the world, Artie...

47:42.361 --> 47:45.531
by organizing these little food co-ops?

47:48.868 --> 47:50.203
I'm going out.

47:52.288 --> 47:53.956
You can stay the night...

47:54.040 --> 47:58.211
but when I get back, I don't want to see
these things within 10 miles of my kids.

48:18.147 --> 48:20.483
Annie, I'd like to explain this.

48:21.859 --> 48:23.194
I'm listening.

48:25.488 --> 48:27.824
You know,
we've been under a long time.

48:28.825 --> 48:32.829
A lot of bad shit has happened.
A lot of bad shit keeps happening.

48:34.831 --> 48:36.332
But we're dead...

48:39.836 --> 48:43.297
as far as the world is concerned.

48:43.381 --> 48:45.883
We pull an action
and they bury it in the newspapers.

48:46.592 --> 48:48.594
It's like it didn't happen.

48:49.387 --> 48:52.265
The only time the pigs
or the media pay attention...

48:52.348 --> 48:55.434
is when something
or somebody gets blown away.

48:56.477 --> 48:59.814
Great. If you can't beat them, join them.

49:00.648 --> 49:04.819
Do you think we're going to win this
by turning the other cheek?

49:06.654 --> 49:08.781
Why don't you try walking on water?

49:08.865 --> 49:12.201
Why don't you try growing up?
There's nothing to win.

49:13.035 --> 49:15.037
It was over as soon as the war ended.

49:15.830 --> 49:19.667
The war didn't end, Annie.
The war ain't never going to end.

49:19.834 --> 49:24.797
This has nothing to do with politics
or the merchandise in my car.

49:24.881 --> 49:26.841
This is just Artie's pissed.

49:29.844 --> 49:31.387
Artie's pissed...

49:32.430 --> 49:33.890
'cause Artie's jealous.

49:36.309 --> 49:38.311
And Artie's jealous...

49:41.814 --> 49:43.524
because you want me.

49:44.984 --> 49:46.652
And I sure want you.

49:50.990 --> 49:52.825
That's a bad situation.

49:55.703 --> 49:58.372
Sooner or later,
they're just going to blow up.

50:02.668 --> 50:04.670
You know, I feel sorry for you.

50:05.046 --> 50:06.214
I do.

50:06.881 --> 50:08.883
You're a 46-year-old infant.

50:10.384 --> 50:15.056
Everything has to be your way, doesn't it?
When you want it, where you want it.

50:17.183 --> 50:18.976
You're not a revolutionary.

50:19.060 --> 50:23.397
That requires more than playing with guns
or with yourself.

50:25.233 --> 50:28.194
It requires compassion, discipline.

50:28.277 --> 50:30.530
Are you judging me?

50:37.328 --> 50:39.497
You judge yourself, lady.

50:40.998 --> 50:45.169
You're living like some kind of silly-ass,
middle-class, suburban housewife.

50:48.506 --> 50:50.174
You're living a lie...

50:51.175 --> 50:53.177
just like you said.

50:55.346 --> 51:00.184
Why don't you take this little
Norman Rockwell family and turn them in?

51:01.519 --> 51:03.396
The feds would be glad to get them.

51:04.689 --> 51:06.190
And then you could get the fuck out.

51:09.861 --> 51:11.195
I wish I could.

51:13.865 --> 51:15.366
Now get out.

51:42.894 --> 51:44.270
Are you okay, Mom?

51:46.105 --> 51:47.148
Yeah.

51:48.149 --> 51:49.400
Fine.

52:06.626 --> 52:07.960
Go to bed.

52:53.840 --> 52:57.510
I am not Paul. I am not Paul! I am--

53:00.721 --> 53:03.683
-Paul, come in.
-I'm not Paul.

53:03.975 --> 53:05.226
I'm Arthur.

53:05.643 --> 53:08.020
Don't call me "Paul." I am Arthur.

53:08.563 --> 53:11.399
I am Arthur Eli Pope!

53:12.316 --> 53:14.819
-What's the matter with Dad?
-He's just had a lot to drink.

53:14.902 --> 53:19.866
Born in Plattsburg, New York,
July 16, 1944!

53:20.408 --> 53:22.910
A US citizen. My mother's...

53:23.619 --> 53:25.955
maiden name is Silbowitz.

53:26.205 --> 53:29.709
My father's real name is Popov.
Morris Popov.

53:31.043 --> 53:33.713
My driver's license number is 4-3-5-7...

53:34.463 --> 53:35.631
1-1.

53:36.674 --> 53:39.468
My draft number is M-S-8-9...

53:39.719 --> 53:43.222
-3-5-8-4.
-It's okay.

53:44.223 --> 53:46.225
My name is Pope.

53:46.350 --> 53:47.476
It's okay.

54:16.631 --> 54:18.799
You said walk, not hike.

54:20.301 --> 54:22.136
-Are you tired?
-No.

54:28.809 --> 54:31.312
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah.

54:34.315 --> 54:36.651
You know,
I was really surprised when you called me.

54:37.902 --> 54:39.028
Why?

54:39.821 --> 54:42.323
I wasn't sure if you liked me or not.

54:43.324 --> 54:46.035
Sometimes you're so...

54:46.911 --> 54:48.246
distant.

54:50.331 --> 54:53.876
I'm not too sure
if you like me too much, either.

54:55.419 --> 54:59.590
Take it on faith. I usually don't follow
people I don't like for 10 miles...

54:59.674 --> 55:01.175
into the middle of the woods.

55:01.259 --> 55:02.760
Why are you so angry?

55:03.594 --> 55:05.346
That's wit, not anger.

55:06.430 --> 55:09.308
-You scare a lot of people.
-Who, besides you?

55:13.771 --> 55:15.731
A lot of people scare me.

55:15.815 --> 55:17.441
Who scares you?

55:22.488 --> 55:25.491
People who are nice, like my parents.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.162
What's wrong with being nice?

55:29.829 --> 55:31.831
Let's put it like this.

55:32.748 --> 55:35.168
My mother is really nice.

55:35.626 --> 55:38.796
She never does anything wrong or mean.

55:40.423 --> 55:42.717
She even gives her old clothes
to the maid...

55:42.800 --> 55:46.095
but she doesn't really want to know her.

55:46.179 --> 55:48.848
In 10 years,
she's never even seen Betty's husband.

55:50.057 --> 55:52.560
He waits in the car
when he comes to pick her up.

55:55.563 --> 55:57.648
Your father's sure not like that.

55:57.899 --> 55:59.859
Why? Because he plays Madonna in class?

55:59.942 --> 56:02.778
What does he know about you,
except that you're good on the piano?

56:03.279 --> 56:06.574
They see what they want to see,
and they block out everything else...

56:06.657 --> 56:09.076
especially if it might not be nice.

56:10.411 --> 56:12.371
They don't seem to get in your way much.

56:12.455 --> 56:15.833
My parents? It's just their way
of not believing who I really am.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.586
They think that eventually,
I'll turn back into the little girl...

56:18.669 --> 56:21.631
in the pink dress
that's in the picture on the piano.

56:24.634 --> 56:26.135
And what do you think?

56:26.802 --> 56:28.554
You really want to know?

56:28.804 --> 56:32.642
I think that I'll go to New York
and learn to write...

56:32.892 --> 56:35.228
and that I'll come home every Christmas...

56:35.478 --> 56:38.314
and everyone will be really polite.

56:39.482 --> 56:41.484
That's doesn't sound so bad.

56:42.735 --> 56:45.238
Maybe not, but I'm not in New York yet.

56:51.661 --> 56:52.954
So what about you?

56:54.622 --> 56:56.541
I don't know a thing about you.

56:56.624 --> 56:59.961
You might as well have sprung full-grown
out of the head of Zeus.

57:00.628 --> 57:02.797
Who are your parents? Ozzie and Harriet?

57:03.130 --> 57:04.799
Yeah, sometimes.

57:05.633 --> 57:07.969
Do I get to meet them
and see how you came out so perfect?

57:08.052 --> 57:09.512
I mean, it seems only fair.

57:10.429 --> 57:12.723
I showed you mine, you show me yours.

57:18.479 --> 57:20.648
I guess this is the end of the rest stop.

57:24.152 --> 57:25.820
What did I say?

57:28.239 --> 57:30.575
I thought it would be nicer down here.

57:32.326 --> 57:34.996
You don't transmit too much information.

57:35.830 --> 57:36.873
What?

57:37.331 --> 57:40.251
I said,
you don't transmit too much information.

57:41.502 --> 57:42.837
Sorry.

57:44.463 --> 57:46.632
What are you doing over the summer?

57:48.634 --> 57:50.970
I have a job pumping gas.

57:51.304 --> 57:54.140
You finally got the Supreme Court
to hear your case, huh?

57:57.143 --> 57:58.644
What about you?

57:59.979 --> 58:01.314
I don't know.

58:03.816 --> 58:05.818
You thought it'd be nicer over here?

58:07.987 --> 58:09.030
Yeah.

58:18.331 --> 58:19.707
What are you doing?

58:22.835 --> 58:25.796
I'm looking for something
for my mom's birthday.

58:27.924 --> 58:29.383
You mean,
in case somebody happened to leave...

58:29.467 --> 58:31.302
a Cuisinart or a diamond ring
lying on the beach?

58:31.677 --> 58:34.847
Yeah, that would qualify. It has to be
something either you make or find.

58:34.931 --> 58:37.475
-When's her birthday?
-Next week.

58:59.413 --> 59:00.915
That's beautiful.

59:03.084 --> 59:04.752
It's for your mother.

59:07.421 --> 59:08.923
You give it to her.

59:11.634 --> 59:12.677
Okay.

59:16.681 --> 59:18.266
It must be nicer over there.

59:20.518 --> 59:22.687
Here, chop these.

59:32.488 --> 59:35.575
No, no, no. Watch. Move.

59:36.159 --> 59:37.910
You hold the knife...

59:37.994 --> 59:40.163
and you just do that.

59:40.496 --> 59:41.914
That's neat. Let me try.

59:41.998 --> 59:46.502
No, no. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want
pieces of tiny little fingers in my stew.

59:46.586 --> 59:47.920
Here. You stir.

59:50.423 --> 59:52.216
Were you expecting someone?

1:00:00.808 --> 1:00:01.851
Hi.

1:00:03.436 --> 1:00:04.770
I'm Lorna.

1:00:06.022 --> 1:00:07.690
Michael invited me.

1:00:09.025 --> 1:00:10.860
Well, come in.

1:00:16.782 --> 1:00:18.284
Your friend's here.

1:00:19.785 --> 1:00:20.828
Hi.

1:00:23.831 --> 1:00:25.625
-Hi.
-Can I help?

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.336
No. No, it's okay. Thank you.

1:00:28.836 --> 1:00:30.338
You cut your finger.

1:00:30.421 --> 1:00:31.464
Yeah.

1:00:31.964 --> 1:00:33.799
Is this your girlfriend?

1:00:34.133 --> 1:00:35.968
Hi, I'm Stephen.

1:00:38.971 --> 1:00:41.933
That was delicious, babe.
You outdid yourself.

1:00:42.016 --> 1:00:45.353
This pilgrim food for my very own WASP.

1:00:45.937 --> 1:00:47.688
But you must forgive me, my darling.

1:00:47.772 --> 1:00:50.274
I couldn't get myself
to make one of those Jell-O molds.

1:00:52.026 --> 1:00:53.778
You're forgiven this time.

1:00:53.861 --> 1:00:56.364
And now, for the pièce de résistance.

1:00:56.614 --> 1:00:59.784
-Let me, Dad.
-You're under arrest.

1:01:09.544 --> 1:01:11.796
Look at this.
You got it all over your bellybutton.

1:01:11.879 --> 1:01:13.548
Look at that.

1:01:14.006 --> 1:01:17.677
Oh, God. I'm old enough
to set the house on fire.

1:01:40.950 --> 1:01:43.870
I'm sorry, I thought your mother's name
was Cynthia.

1:01:44.203 --> 1:01:46.205
On birthdays, we're all Sam.

1:01:46.497 --> 1:01:47.915
It's a little family tradition...

1:01:47.999 --> 1:01:51.669
resulting from a particularly good LSD trip
I took in 1968.

1:01:55.173 --> 1:01:56.507
More wine?

1:01:58.050 --> 1:02:00.887
-Would you give me a break?
-In Europe, kids drink wine.

1:02:00.970 --> 1:02:05.308
Get your mother her present
before I call Alcoholics Anonymous.

1:02:14.609 --> 1:02:15.651
Thanks.

1:02:21.324 --> 1:02:24.243
It's just what I wanted.

1:02:24.327 --> 1:02:26.662
-Really?
-Absolutely.

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.793
What is that, a butterfly?

1:02:32.877 --> 1:02:35.171
No, it's a whale of a present.

1:02:42.678 --> 1:02:44.430
-Thanks.
-I'll play it for you sometime.

1:02:45.389 --> 1:02:47.892
This is from Lorna.

1:02:55.733 --> 1:02:57.401
That's beautiful.

1:02:58.319 --> 1:02:59.987
Thank you, Lorna.

1:03:02.907 --> 1:03:05.076
Mine, you get later.

1:03:05.576 --> 1:03:06.744
You bet.

1:03:07.745 --> 1:03:09.080
On your feet!

1:03:09.330 --> 1:03:10.665
Let me help.

1:03:12.917 --> 1:03:14.418
I like her.

1:03:14.502 --> 1:03:15.586
Yeah?

1:03:15.670 --> 1:03:18.005
-I like her, too.
-I know.

1:04:13.686 --> 1:04:15.980
You sure this is the Phillips' kid?

1:04:16.230 --> 1:04:18.816
They didn't switch you at the hospital,
or anything, did they?

1:05:17.166 --> 1:05:20.211
You know,
I can't believe how incredible they are.

1:05:20.545 --> 1:05:25.716
Do you know what my mother would do
if I gave her a shell for her birthday?

1:05:26.133 --> 1:05:27.802
They're okay.

1:05:28.719 --> 1:05:31.556
That's you all over,
afraid to commit yourself.

1:05:32.473 --> 1:05:34.308
I thought it was just me.

1:05:38.563 --> 1:05:40.356
I'm very happy with you.

1:05:42.984 --> 1:05:45.236
I'm very happy with you, too.

1:06:43.503 --> 1:06:45.588
It's okay, I want to.

1:07:37.849 --> 1:07:40.351
-You weren't in cooking.
-You noticed.

1:07:40.852 --> 1:07:42.854
-Where were you?
-I cut.

1:07:44.564 --> 1:07:46.941
-Why?
-I didn't want to see you.

1:08:09.755 --> 1:08:12.758
Manfield, could I talk to you for a minute?

1:08:17.763 --> 1:08:20.433
You don't have to look so anxious.
If you've done something wrong...

1:08:20.516 --> 1:08:23.561
I don't know about it. I just want
to talk to you about your college plans.

1:08:23.644 --> 1:08:27.648
I was thinking of taking a year off, maybe
traveling to Europe, listening to music.

1:08:27.732 --> 1:08:31.235
I can't tell you what to do, but I think you
ought to make an application, anyway.

1:08:31.319 --> 1:08:33.279
You can always postpone entry.

1:08:33.362 --> 1:08:35.740
I'd like you to consider applying
to Juilliard.

1:08:35.823 --> 1:08:37.366
Early admission.

1:08:41.204 --> 1:08:45.124
I looked at your academic records.
You should have no trouble getting in.

1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:46.709
Where's the rest of it, by the way?

1:08:46.792 --> 1:08:48.836
There's nothing in your file
from your old school.

1:08:50.546 --> 1:08:52.715
It was lost when we moved.

1:08:54.050 --> 1:08:55.551
When it comes through, I'd like to see it.

1:08:56.802 --> 1:08:58.805
In the meantime, you look at that.

1:09:03.893 --> 1:09:06.020
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

1:09:06.729 --> 1:09:07.980
Thank you.

1:09:11.067 --> 1:09:13.486
Get back to me when you've looked at it.

1:10:19.010 --> 1:10:21.012
You wouldn't talk to me.

1:10:23.514 --> 1:10:24.849
Now, get up.

1:10:25.224 --> 1:10:27.727
Go down the stairs and out the back door.

1:10:28.227 --> 1:10:29.729
Be quiet.

1:10:39.572 --> 1:10:41.407
I'll be right behind you.

1:10:54.128 --> 1:10:55.796
I'm barefoot.

1:11:28.287 --> 1:11:29.455
Sit down.

1:11:38.422 --> 1:11:39.966
What am I doing?

1:11:43.803 --> 1:11:45.847
I just wanted to talk to you.

1:11:48.099 --> 1:11:50.434
You wouldn't listen,
the other day at school.

1:11:56.607 --> 1:12:01.195
I couldn't stay with you that night.
Not because I didn't want to.

1:12:10.997 --> 1:12:13.332
If you want to go back, it's fine with me.

1:12:15.209 --> 1:12:17.420
-You're a bully.
-No.

1:12:21.007 --> 1:12:22.466
I'm a liar.

1:12:26.012 --> 1:12:27.680
My name isn't Michael.

1:12:30.141 --> 1:12:31.267
It's Danny.

1:12:32.768 --> 1:12:36.522
My parents are Arthur and Annie Pope.

1:12:38.941 --> 1:12:43.279
They're in trouble with the FBI
for blowing up a napalm lab in 1971.

1:12:43.362 --> 1:12:45.239
There was a man who was almost killed.

1:12:45.323 --> 1:12:47.241
A janitor,
who wasn't supposed to be there.

1:12:47.325 --> 1:12:50.244
We put "Sam" on the birthday cakes,
on all the birthday cakes...

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.581
because we change our names
every time we move.

1:12:56.542 --> 1:12:59.712
I've been doing this since I was two.

1:13:00.755 --> 1:13:02.590
I don't know any other way.

1:13:03.257 --> 1:13:06.636
I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry.

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:13.017
I wanted to explain
why I can't talk about a lot of things.

1:13:13.601 --> 1:13:17.230
Like college. I can't go to college.
I can't leave them.

1:13:20.942 --> 1:13:22.777
And I wanted to tell you...

1:13:23.945 --> 1:13:25.655
why I couldn't be with you.

1:13:26.656 --> 1:13:29.492
Not without your knowing.
I didn't want to lie to you.

1:13:31.452 --> 1:13:35.206
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

1:13:35.289 --> 1:13:38.125
It's dangerous for you,
and it's dangerous for them.

1:13:40.294 --> 1:13:42.505
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

1:13:43.005 --> 1:13:46.592
You can do what you want to. You can
tell your dad anything. I don't care.

1:13:47.593 --> 1:13:49.428
I just needed you to know.

1:13:51.097 --> 1:13:53.432
I don't know what I'm doing.

1:13:56.269 --> 1:13:57.520
And I love you.

1:14:02.108 --> 1:14:03.442
I love you.

1:14:35.266 --> 1:14:36.767
What do I call you?

1:14:36.851 --> 1:14:39.896
Michael. Nothing changes.

1:14:40.813 --> 1:14:43.149
They really don't want you
to go to school, huh?

1:14:45.735 --> 1:14:47.570
We haven't talked about it.

1:14:48.404 --> 1:14:50.114
-I can't ask them.
-Why not?

1:14:51.741 --> 1:14:54.410
It would mean breaking up the family,
not seeing them again.

1:14:55.870 --> 1:14:57.830
They don't have anything else.

1:14:59.332 --> 1:15:04.337
I can't believe that they'd want you to
give up your whole life to stay with them.

1:15:04.921 --> 1:15:07.256
Talk to them. They'll understand.

1:15:11.886 --> 1:15:14.055
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

1:15:15.807 --> 1:15:17.600
Now you have another one.

1:15:59.267 --> 1:16:00.768
Been to see Lorna?

1:16:10.820 --> 1:16:12.321
I like that one.

1:16:12.780 --> 1:16:14.448
She's full of beans.

1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:18.995
You really like her, don't you?

1:16:20.329 --> 1:16:22.582
The smart ones are always the best.

1:16:24.834 --> 1:16:26.544
Are you sleeping with her?

1:16:28.254 --> 1:16:30.339
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1:16:32.008 --> 1:16:34.760
Go ahead, hit the sack.
You got school tomorrow.

1:17:44.121 --> 1:17:46.374
How long have you been playing violin...

1:17:46.457 --> 1:17:49.627
after you stopped playing seriously piano?

1:17:50.294 --> 1:17:51.587
About five years.

1:17:51.671 --> 1:17:53.464
When did you come to the States?

1:17:54.298 --> 1:17:55.591
In 1980.

1:17:55.675 --> 1:17:57.760
All right. Thank you very much.

1:17:58.344 --> 1:18:01.347
Mr. Manfield. We're ready for you now.

1:20:32.832 --> 1:20:35.293
Who did you say you studied with?

1:20:36.919 --> 1:20:38.462
Edward Phillips.

1:20:38.546 --> 1:20:40.965
-Where was this?
-Waterford.

1:20:41.632 --> 1:20:43.801
-New Jersey?
-That's right.

1:20:44.135 --> 1:20:46.304
We seem not to have
all your school records.

1:20:48.306 --> 1:20:52.351
There was a school fire at my old school,
and the records were lost.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:55.062
We only moved to New Jersey this year.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:59.984
So you've only studied with Mr. Phillips
for a short time.

1:21:00.401 --> 1:21:01.736
Yes, ma'am.

1:21:01.819 --> 1:21:03.821
Who else have you worked with?

1:21:06.032 --> 1:21:08.659
A lot of different people.
No one important.

1:21:09.076 --> 1:21:11.078
We move a lot.

1:21:11.370 --> 1:21:14.665
You'll have to supply us
with SAT scores and...

1:21:15.708 --> 1:21:17.502
we'll have to have those records.

1:21:22.131 --> 1:21:23.174
Mr. Manfield.

1:21:24.008 --> 1:21:25.051
Oh, sorry.

1:21:27.053 --> 1:21:30.515
You are very talented, you know.

1:21:33.142 --> 1:21:34.644
Thank you, ma'am.

1:22:41.335 --> 1:22:43.754
A cheese pizza for Mrs. Patterson.

1:22:44.213 --> 1:22:46.841
I don't think Mrs. Patterson
ordered a pizza.

1:22:48.342 --> 1:22:52.346
Is this Murray Hill 68434?

1:22:52.555 --> 1:22:54.432
-Yes.
-Someone ordered it.

1:22:55.057 --> 1:22:56.100
Just a minute.

1:23:07.487 --> 1:23:09.530
What's this about a pizza?

1:23:11.199 --> 1:23:12.992
You ordered one.

1:23:14.535 --> 1:23:15.912
I didn't.

1:23:17.997 --> 1:23:19.749
Will you have to pay for it?

1:23:21.042 --> 1:23:23.461
No, I'll have to eat it.

1:23:34.889 --> 1:23:37.934
I really don't care. Hold on.
Could you knock next time?

1:23:38.309 --> 1:23:40.812
-I'm sorry.
-Listen, I have to go. Yeah. Bye.

1:23:44.315 --> 1:23:46.776
I was wondering if Michael
had ever mentioned anything to you...

1:23:46.859 --> 1:23:47.902
about his old school.

1:23:48.236 --> 1:23:49.445
Not much. Why?

1:23:49.529 --> 1:23:51.364
They never sent his records.

1:23:52.532 --> 1:23:53.616
So?

1:23:53.950 --> 1:23:55.785
I called the school.
They have no record of him.

1:23:55.868 --> 1:23:59.038
They probably got eaten by a computer,
or something.

1:23:59.872 --> 1:24:02.834
They don't have a computer
in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

1:24:04.085 --> 1:24:06.045
What are you on his case for?

1:24:07.088 --> 1:24:10.383
-We know nothing about him.
-So, he's an axe murderer.

1:24:10.633 --> 1:24:14.720
I mean, come on! I thought he was
the best music student you ever had.

1:24:14.804 --> 1:24:17.640
He is, but that doesn't explain
his missing records.

1:24:18.975 --> 1:24:21.644
If you want to know who he is,
why don't you talk to him?

1:24:22.436 --> 1:24:24.105
He's a person!

1:24:25.898 --> 1:24:27.984
He's not a computer printout!

1:24:34.949 --> 1:24:37.285
Would you please close the door?

1:24:45.501 --> 1:24:46.544
-Mrs. Manfield?
-Yes.

1:24:46.752 --> 1:24:48.504
-Thank you for coming.
-How do you do?

1:24:48.588 --> 1:24:50.673
-Would you like some coffee?
-No, thanks.

1:24:55.887 --> 1:24:57.680
I want to talk to you about Michael.

1:24:58.222 --> 1:25:01.350
I didn't want to meet at school,
because he doesn't know we're talking.

1:25:01.434 --> 1:25:03.311
But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

1:25:03.394 --> 1:25:05.646
I thought
maybe there was something at home.

1:25:07.064 --> 1:25:08.107
No.

1:25:08.983 --> 1:25:13.070
I know these things are private. I just
thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

1:25:13.488 --> 1:25:15.281
But there isn't anything. Really.

1:25:16.741 --> 1:25:18.868
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

1:25:20.495 --> 1:25:21.537
Juilliard?

1:25:22.705 --> 1:25:24.332
You know about his plans?

1:25:24.916 --> 1:25:27.543
-Yeah, sure.
-And you don't object?

1:25:28.044 --> 1:25:29.086
No.

1:25:30.087 --> 1:25:32.548
They were very impressed
with his audition.

1:25:34.550 --> 1:25:37.678
They're prepared to take him,
just as soon as they get his records.

1:25:40.765 --> 1:25:43.059
He'll have to go then, won't he?

1:25:44.060 --> 1:25:46.103
Is there a financial problem?

1:25:46.938 --> 1:25:49.357
We're not the Rockefellers.

1:25:49.857 --> 1:25:51.818
He could be worried about that.

1:25:51.901 --> 1:25:53.528
We always manage.

1:25:53.694 --> 1:25:56.364
There are scholarships. He could get one.

1:25:56.572 --> 1:25:58.074
He's very talented.

1:25:58.407 --> 1:26:01.577
We may not have a lot,
but we care about our kids.

1:26:01.661 --> 1:26:03.162
I'm sure you do.

1:26:03.830 --> 1:26:07.708
I was just wondering,
has he ever had a serious teacher?

1:26:08.668 --> 1:26:10.670
How has he gotten this far?

1:26:10.753 --> 1:26:12.296
I don't know.

1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:15.967
He's picked up a little here and there.
We move around a lot. Why?

1:26:16.092 --> 1:26:19.095
I called Blue Hill and they have no record
of Michael Manfield.

1:26:24.350 --> 1:26:26.769
That's because he wasn't registered
there under Manfield.

1:26:27.103 --> 1:26:29.397
See, I was married before,
and Paul adopted him.

1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:32.400
But it took until just this year
to adopt his name legally.

1:26:32.483 --> 1:26:35.153
He's under my old husband's name
at Blue Hill.

1:26:36.195 --> 1:26:38.614
He can't finish his application
without those records.

1:26:38.698 --> 1:26:40.032
I'll get them.

1:26:40.283 --> 1:26:43.202
You'll have to, because they won't
release them to anyone but a parent--

1:26:43.286 --> 1:26:45.705
I said, I'll get them. All right?

1:26:47.874 --> 1:26:49.542
-Now, if you'll excuse me.
-Yeah, sure.

1:29:00.131 --> 1:29:01.632
What's wrong, Mom?

1:29:03.593 --> 1:29:04.677
Nothing.

1:29:07.930 --> 1:29:09.432
I just love you.

1:29:27.450 --> 1:29:29.368
I've got to pick up your father.

1:29:42.006 --> 1:29:45.802
Do you like it? I traded the van in for it.
Thought it'd be more practical.

1:29:46.385 --> 1:29:48.346
Besides, it keeps them guessing.

1:29:58.856 --> 1:30:00.274
What's up, Sam?

1:30:00.566 --> 1:30:02.235
Don't call me that.

1:30:03.319 --> 1:30:04.362
Okay.

1:30:09.116 --> 1:30:11.035
Danny's applied to college.

1:30:13.538 --> 1:30:14.622
Where?

1:30:14.914 --> 1:30:16.249
Juilliard.

1:30:17.333 --> 1:30:18.501
How do you know?

1:30:18.584 --> 1:30:21.087
Phillips. He wants him to go.

1:30:23.548 --> 1:30:26.384
Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose
out of our business?

1:30:26.467 --> 1:30:28.469
Because he thinks he's talented.

1:30:30.012 --> 1:30:31.472
Has Danny told you about any of this?

1:30:32.807 --> 1:30:33.850
No.

1:30:38.271 --> 1:30:39.814
What are we going to do?

1:30:40.356 --> 1:30:41.691
Shit.

1:30:42.358 --> 1:30:45.111
Goddamn fucking shit!

1:30:45.862 --> 1:30:47.196
Why can't he go?

1:30:47.488 --> 1:30:49.407
Because we'll never see him again
if he does.

1:30:49.490 --> 1:30:51.784
Why? We could arrange to meet him.

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:53.995
Is that what you want?

1:30:54.078 --> 1:30:58.749
Ten minutes at an airport lounge, and the
FBI all over his ass the rest of the time?

1:31:00.042 --> 1:31:03.504
You want him standing in phone booths
and Laundromats like my parents...

1:31:03.629 --> 1:31:06.757
only connecting with us
through the network? I don't think so.

1:31:07.842 --> 1:31:10.178
If he goes,
we're never going to see him again...

1:31:10.803 --> 1:31:13.139
and that is unacceptable to me.

1:31:23.024 --> 1:31:25.943
I never even let myself think about this.

1:31:27.278 --> 1:31:29.614
I was so stupid.

1:31:32.283 --> 1:31:34.535
All I wanted
was that we would be together.

1:31:37.955 --> 1:31:40.917
We should have left Danny
with my mother.

1:31:42.418 --> 1:31:44.670
-We never should have had Harry.
-Stop it.

1:31:44.754 --> 1:31:48.966
I can't, Arthur.
Look what we're doing to these kids.

1:31:49.717 --> 1:31:52.053
They've been running their whole lives
like criminals.

1:31:52.136 --> 1:31:53.471
And they didn't do anything!

1:31:53.805 --> 1:31:55.014
It isn't fair.

1:31:55.097 --> 1:31:57.433
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

1:31:57.934 --> 1:32:01.896
They've taken some bumps, but it's not
going to help anything to beat yourself up.

1:32:03.940 --> 1:32:05.942
Look at them, for God's sake.

1:32:06.025 --> 1:32:08.861
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

1:32:09.529 --> 1:32:11.030
They're beautiful.

1:32:11.113 --> 1:32:13.199
And bright. Caring.

1:32:14.367 --> 1:32:16.327
How badly could we have done?

1:32:19.956 --> 1:32:21.707
We should turn ourselves in.

1:32:23.626 --> 1:32:26.212
So we can sit in prison
for the next 15 years...

1:32:26.295 --> 1:32:28.589
and look at the kids through bars?

1:32:29.132 --> 1:32:32.593
You can only get through this
one day, one hour at a time.

1:32:33.886 --> 1:32:35.888
That's what I'm doing.

1:32:37.598 --> 1:32:39.600
And Danny's all grown up.

1:32:43.229 --> 1:32:44.689
We have to let him go.

1:32:54.532 --> 1:32:56.450
This tooth is killing me.

1:32:56.534 --> 1:32:59.704
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

1:33:01.205 --> 1:33:02.707
I'll take a bus.

1:33:03.291 --> 1:33:05.459
-I always worry when you go into the city.
-Why?

1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:07.962
Because that's where they get everyone.

1:33:08.212 --> 1:33:09.714
It's been quiet.

1:33:11.048 --> 1:33:13.050
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

1:33:13.468 --> 1:33:15.720
Remember what you used to say
when the kids were small?

1:33:15.887 --> 1:33:18.222
"Don't worry
unless you don't hear anything."

1:33:19.056 --> 1:33:20.892
Be careful, all right?

1:33:31.402 --> 1:33:34.363
I don't see anything.
And there's nothing on the x-ray.

1:33:34.447 --> 1:33:36.115
I'm not complaining.

1:33:38.743 --> 1:33:40.286
You need anything else?

1:33:42.288 --> 1:33:45.958
No, thanks. We're okay.
I'm working for a GP.

1:33:46.792 --> 1:33:48.294
How about cash?

1:33:49.378 --> 1:33:50.546
Okay.

1:33:52.298 --> 1:33:56.302
If you'd give me some notice,
I could arrange to have more.

1:33:56.552 --> 1:33:59.222
No. This is great. Thanks.

1:34:00.890 --> 1:34:03.893
-You always make me feel so guilty.
-Why?

1:34:04.143 --> 1:34:05.686
You're living it.

1:34:06.229 --> 1:34:08.898
Yeah, I guess I am.

1:34:10.900 --> 1:34:14.737
Jonah, I need you
to make a phone call for me.

1:34:15.613 --> 1:34:16.823
Of course.

1:34:25.331 --> 1:34:26.374
Madame?

1:34:53.901 --> 1:34:55.069
Hi, Dad.

1:34:58.906 --> 1:35:01.075
I asked Jonah to set this up.

1:35:06.289 --> 1:35:08.040
You can call the cops if you want to.

1:35:16.883 --> 1:35:18.426
I'm sorry.

1:35:20.761 --> 1:35:22.597
This is hard for me, too.

1:35:25.057 --> 1:35:27.727
-Will madame have a drink?
-No, thank you.

1:35:34.859 --> 1:35:37.778
I wonder if you'll ever know
what it's like...

1:35:37.862 --> 1:35:40.573
not to see your child for 14 years.

1:35:43.951 --> 1:35:46.787
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

1:35:54.128 --> 1:35:55.463
Not knowing whether that child...

1:35:56.380 --> 1:36:00.843
is responsible for the death
and mutilation of other human beings.

1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:05.223
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

1:36:05.723 --> 1:36:07.558
for that death and mutilation...

1:36:08.100 --> 1:36:12.021
because it is your child who is pulling
the triggers, setting the bombs.

1:36:12.104 --> 1:36:14.106
I didn't kill anybody.

1:36:16.776 --> 1:36:20.446
I didn't come here to defend myself
or to talk politics.

1:36:21.614 --> 1:36:26.369
If you don't believe by now that what I did
was an act of conscience to stop the war...

1:36:26.786 --> 1:36:29.872
then there's nothing I can say to you
that's going to make you understand.

1:36:29.956 --> 1:36:31.958
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

1:36:32.041 --> 1:36:33.793
He wasn't supposed to be there.

1:36:38.297 --> 1:36:39.757
Don't you think there have been times...

1:36:39.841 --> 1:36:42.760
that I would have blinded
and paralyzed myself to take that back?

1:36:43.052 --> 1:36:44.637
It's all Arthur's influence.

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:46.389
No, Dad, it isn't.

1:36:47.265 --> 1:36:48.641
It was my idea.

1:36:49.225 --> 1:36:51.727
I'm living with the consequences
of my own choice.

1:36:51.811 --> 1:36:53.688
-I don't believe it.
-Well, that's your problem.

1:36:53.771 --> 1:36:55.356
Your mother and me....

1:36:56.607 --> 1:36:58.151
Do you think about us?

1:37:05.074 --> 1:37:07.618
-Do you really have to ask that?
-Yes.

1:37:13.291 --> 1:37:15.793
The last thing
I remember you saying to me...

1:37:17.211 --> 1:37:19.630
was that I was an imperialist pig...

1:37:19.881 --> 1:37:24.886
personally responsible for the war,
the spread of poverty, racism.

1:37:26.137 --> 1:37:27.763
-I was young.
-Yes.

1:37:31.476 --> 1:37:33.311
You were young.

1:37:34.812 --> 1:37:36.147
And talented.

1:37:38.149 --> 1:37:39.233
And beautiful.

1:37:40.568 --> 1:37:42.403
And so full of love.

1:37:45.114 --> 1:37:48.451
My God, Annie.
Why did you throw it all away?

1:37:54.749 --> 1:37:57.919
Your mother misses you terribly.
And Danny.

1:38:02.632 --> 1:38:04.300
Will you take him, Dad?

1:38:06.969 --> 1:38:08.596
He wants to study music.

1:38:09.472 --> 1:38:10.973
He's good.

1:38:11.474 --> 1:38:13.184
They want him at Juilliard.

1:38:15.311 --> 1:38:17.230
Just like they wanted you.

1:38:20.650 --> 1:38:23.069
Do you still have that practice board?

1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:27.824
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

1:38:29.659 --> 1:38:31.327
So you taught him?

1:38:34.914 --> 1:38:37.917
There's some irony in this,
don't you think?

1:38:39.627 --> 1:38:41.087
Here you are...

1:38:41.796 --> 1:38:44.132
asking me to take Danny...

1:38:44.966 --> 1:38:49.178
into a life that you ran from
like a shot out of hell.

1:38:51.806 --> 1:38:53.516
Is this what he wants?

1:38:53.599 --> 1:38:55.101
I think so.

1:38:55.476 --> 1:38:58.479
He got himself an audition
without telling me.

1:39:01.274 --> 1:39:04.944
He'll need money,
and people to care for him.

1:39:06.154 --> 1:39:08.406
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

1:39:09.574 --> 1:39:11.409
I hardly know the boy.

1:39:13.494 --> 1:39:14.996
If we take him...

1:39:17.832 --> 1:39:21.544
there'd be FBI agents
following us everywhere we go.

1:39:22.879 --> 1:39:24.255
You'd never be able to see him.

1:39:26.299 --> 1:39:27.967
We're too old for this.

1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:33.639
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

1:39:40.396 --> 1:39:42.064
I have another son.

1:39:42.773 --> 1:39:45.109
He's 10. Harry.

1:39:47.111 --> 1:39:48.946
I heard about it on the news.

1:39:50.948 --> 1:39:52.617
I plan to turn myself in...

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:56.537
when he doesn't need me anymore.
When he's old enough.

1:39:57.288 --> 1:39:58.623
And Arthur?

1:39:59.123 --> 1:40:00.708
I can't speak for him.

1:40:04.712 --> 1:40:06.547
Please think about this.

1:40:14.472 --> 1:40:15.890
I should go.

1:40:18.935 --> 1:40:19.977
Annie.

1:40:23.397 --> 1:40:25.107
He can come to us.

1:40:41.082 --> 1:40:43.835
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

1:40:45.753 --> 1:40:48.005
And I've thought about you both so often.

1:40:49.382 --> 1:40:51.384
I've called out to you.

1:40:54.011 --> 1:40:57.348
I'm sorry
that I've caused you so much pain.

1:41:02.103 --> 1:41:04.772
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

1:41:10.194 --> 1:41:11.404
I love you, Dad.

1:41:47.773 --> 1:41:49.609
I saw my father.

1:41:51.611 --> 1:41:52.778
You what?

1:41:53.279 --> 1:41:55.114
I saw Donald.

1:41:57.283 --> 1:42:00.286
You just walked into his office
and sat down at his desk?

1:42:00.495 --> 1:42:01.537
No.

1:42:01.662 --> 1:42:05.291
I had lunch with him at La Petite Marmite.

1:42:06.417 --> 1:42:07.627
What for?

1:42:08.795 --> 1:42:10.797
To see if he'd take Danny.

1:42:11.631 --> 1:42:13.299
Take Danny?

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.760
So he can go to college.

1:42:17.595 --> 1:42:18.930
You're kidding.

1:42:20.181 --> 1:42:21.682
He said he would.

1:42:22.517 --> 1:42:24.185
He said he would?

1:42:25.353 --> 1:42:27.563
You know what could have happened?

1:42:29.607 --> 1:42:31.776
Did Phillips put you up to this?

1:42:31.901 --> 1:42:34.278
Nobody put me up to this.

1:42:35.530 --> 1:42:38.533
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

1:42:38.866 --> 1:42:42.829
He wants to go. He applied.
He went to an audition.

1:42:42.912 --> 1:42:45.790
-He went fucking where?
-Juilliard.

1:42:48.292 --> 1:42:50.044
I don't believe my ears.

1:42:50.128 --> 1:42:52.130
Just give him a chance.

1:42:52.672 --> 1:42:55.758
I'm going to call Deborah and see
if she can make him up some records.

1:42:55.842 --> 1:42:57.051
Why?

1:42:57.135 --> 1:42:59.804
Because Phillips called the school
I put on the registration form...

1:42:59.887 --> 1:43:02.014
and they told him
there was no Michael Manfield.

1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:04.142
It's going to be okay.

1:43:04.350 --> 1:43:06.853
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

1:43:10.356 --> 1:43:12.608
We're moving base camp, kids.

1:43:13.776 --> 1:43:15.611
We have a few days, and we're gone.

1:43:16.112 --> 1:43:17.613
Cover your tracks.

1:43:18.072 --> 1:43:19.407
You hear me?

1:43:20.908 --> 1:43:22.785
You have anything you want to tell me?

1:43:23.244 --> 1:43:24.370
No.

1:43:24.453 --> 1:43:25.580
Good.

1:43:44.182 --> 1:43:46.017
My father wants to move on.

1:43:52.190 --> 1:43:53.316
Why?

1:43:54.442 --> 1:43:56.152
He gets a sense.

1:43:58.863 --> 1:44:00.031
Just like that?

1:44:00.781 --> 1:44:02.283
Just like that.

1:44:05.786 --> 1:44:06.954
When?

1:44:08.039 --> 1:44:09.123
Anytime.

1:44:10.208 --> 1:44:12.043
You'll just disappear?

1:44:19.801 --> 1:44:21.302
What about us?

1:44:24.430 --> 1:44:26.808
-They need me.
-I need you!

1:44:28.893 --> 1:44:30.645
You didn't talk to them?

1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:37.860
You can't keep running from something
you had nothing to do with.

1:44:38.194 --> 1:44:40.363
You deserve your own chance.

1:44:54.794 --> 1:44:57.213
-I want to talk to you.
-There's nothing to talk about.

1:44:57.296 --> 1:44:58.714
Phillips knows too much.

1:44:58.798 --> 1:45:01.134
You were letting your feelings
affect your judgment.

1:45:01.384 --> 1:45:03.386
Besides, it's academic.

1:45:15.690 --> 1:45:17.233
Nobody will talk.

1:45:17.733 --> 1:45:18.901
You don't know that.

1:45:20.153 --> 1:45:22.822
They're going to try
to pick up everyone they can now.

1:45:25.074 --> 1:45:26.367
We're finished here.

1:45:34.667 --> 1:45:37.211
-We can close up shop slowly, can't we?
-We'll have to.

1:45:37.462 --> 1:45:40.131
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

1:45:41.048 --> 1:45:43.509
Everybody goes to work and school
until further notice.

1:45:43.593 --> 1:45:46.804
If there's a problem,
will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

1:45:46.888 --> 1:45:50.308
There's no reason
to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

1:46:11.329 --> 1:46:14.332
-Dad, can I talk to you a minute?
-Not now.

1:46:20.963 --> 1:46:22.882
I was thinking about staying.

1:46:23.090 --> 1:46:25.885
-Don't you have school?
-In half an hour.

1:46:43.027 --> 1:46:44.153
I want to stay.

1:46:45.571 --> 1:46:46.739
Stay?

1:46:48.741 --> 1:46:50.868
Do you think this is a good time
to discuss this?

1:46:52.161 --> 1:46:54.580
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

1:46:55.915 --> 1:46:57.375
I taught you!

1:46:57.792 --> 1:47:00.294
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:03.172
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

1:47:03.256 --> 1:47:04.465
We're a unit!

1:47:06.801 --> 1:47:09.303
I taught you all of this,
don't you remember that?

1:47:11.389 --> 1:47:12.974
I don't want to hear you
talking about this...

1:47:13.057 --> 1:47:15.017
in front of your mother or your brother,
do you hear me?

1:47:15.101 --> 1:47:16.602
I said, do you hear me?

1:47:18.855 --> 1:47:20.731
Are we finished talking about this now?

1:47:28.489 --> 1:47:29.532
Mrs. Taylor.

1:47:31.159 --> 1:47:33.035
Just remove everything
and put on the gown.

1:47:33.119 --> 1:47:34.829
The doctor will see you in a few minutes.

1:47:36.747 --> 1:47:40.001
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

1:47:40.668 --> 1:47:42.837
Could you help me with this zipper, dear?

1:47:45.256 --> 1:47:47.884
Did you hear what happened
to Elizabeth Powell last night?

1:47:48.009 --> 1:47:49.051
No, I didn't.

1:47:49.427 --> 1:47:51.596
The FBI came to see her.

1:47:52.430 --> 1:47:54.682
The car that was used
in that bank robbery...

1:47:55.266 --> 1:47:56.809
where they killed those policemen...

1:47:56.893 --> 1:47:59.395
it was rented with her credit card.

1:48:00.021 --> 1:48:01.481
Can you believe it?

1:48:01.981 --> 1:48:05.985
How could they have got hold of her card?
She never even uses it herself.

1:48:06.152 --> 1:48:10.281
That's how come she didn't notice
it was gone.

1:48:11.365 --> 1:48:13.367
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

1:48:13.451 --> 1:48:15.703
They probably just took her name
out of the phone book...

1:48:15.786 --> 1:48:17.079
and made up a false card.

1:48:17.538 --> 1:48:19.332
Can you imagine the bad luck?

1:48:28.841 --> 1:48:32.011
Paul Manfield, please. His wife.

1:48:35.348 --> 1:48:36.891
We're in a hurry.

1:48:37.016 --> 1:48:40.812
Gus took plastic from one of my patients.
He used it to rent the car.

1:48:51.864 --> 1:48:54.742
Frankie? I'm going out for a smoke.

1:49:11.634 --> 1:49:14.971
-Are we in a hurry, Mom?
-Yeah. We have to get Danny.

1:49:21.310 --> 1:49:23.396
I hope your husband is all right.

1:49:31.445 --> 1:49:32.780
Okay, let's go.

1:49:32.864 --> 1:49:35.032
-Mom, I'll meet you there.
-We don't have much time.

1:49:40.705 --> 1:49:44.917
Salinger uses imagery
in Catcher in the Rye to--

1:49:45.793 --> 1:49:46.961
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1:49:47.044 --> 1:49:49.755
Mr. McGuire would like
to see Lorna Phillips.

1:49:49.839 --> 1:49:52.341
-Did he send a note?
-No, ma'am.

1:49:53.217 --> 1:49:54.260
Ms. Phillips?

1:50:11.110 --> 1:50:12.445
We're leaving.

1:50:13.112 --> 1:50:14.947
You didn't ask them?

1:50:16.866 --> 1:50:18.034
I did.

1:50:18.868 --> 1:50:20.453
Artie fell apart.

1:50:20.870 --> 1:50:22.622
He didn't even make any sense.

1:50:23.247 --> 1:50:26.584
Without us, he can't keep it going.

1:50:27.752 --> 1:50:29.587
He needs us to hold him up.

1:50:30.963 --> 1:50:33.049
All families break up.

1:50:34.634 --> 1:50:38.387
Why do you have to carry the burden
of someone else's life?

1:50:40.389 --> 1:50:41.974
He's my father.

1:50:46.562 --> 1:50:48.022
I love you.

1:50:52.985 --> 1:50:54.654
But I have to go.

1:50:56.155 --> 1:50:58.366
I don't know how to say goodbye.

1:51:02.161 --> 1:51:03.329
Well, don't.

1:51:32.817 --> 1:51:34.861
-Where is he?
-He'll be here.

1:51:34.944 --> 1:51:37.321
He went to say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1:51:38.906 --> 1:51:40.783
He knows better than this.

1:51:46.164 --> 1:51:48.916
This is Bob Stone, with a Z-90 newsbreak.

1:51:49.041 --> 1:51:53.254
New Jersey police have reported the death
of Liberation Army member Gus Winant...

1:51:53.337 --> 1:51:56.632
at large after the bank robbery
yesterday afternoon.

1:51:56.716 --> 1:51:59.051
He was shot resisting arrest
near Waterford...

1:51:59.135 --> 1:52:01.721
where he had stolen a car,
and was attempting to flee.

1:52:02.054 --> 1:52:05.725
More at 5:00.
We return you now to the ball game.

1:52:24.619 --> 1:52:26.621
Get the bike out of the back.

1:52:34.879 --> 1:52:36.756
Now get on it.

1:52:39.217 --> 1:52:40.468
What are you talking about, Dad--

1:52:40.551 --> 1:52:44.388
Get on the bike. You're on your own, kid.

1:52:47.517 --> 1:52:49.268
I want you to go to Juilliard.

1:52:49.352 --> 1:52:51.354
But, Dad, I want to go with you.

1:52:53.481 --> 1:52:56.692
We'll see you again. You can be sure.

1:52:58.736 --> 1:53:02.114
Your mother has arranged things
with your grandfather.

1:53:02.198 --> 1:53:03.533
Call him.

1:53:03.908 --> 1:53:05.993
And I think you have some friends
around here.

1:53:07.036 --> 1:53:08.538
I love you, baby.

1:53:12.083 --> 1:53:14.252
We all love you.

1:53:15.253 --> 1:53:17.755
Now, go out there and make a difference.

1:53:19.006 --> 1:53:20.842
Your mother and I tried.

1:53:23.845 --> 1:53:26.347
Don't let anyone tell you any different.

1:53:42.029 --> 1:53:44.073
Goodbye, Danny!
