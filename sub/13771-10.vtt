Oh, my God.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.315
-What?
-Did you see this?

00:11.402 --> 00:12.534
Look what Jamie wrote.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.276
Oh, my God!

00:15.363 --> 00:16.755
He knows his letters.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.496
There are actual words here.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.802
I mean, it's crude,

00:19.889 --> 00:21.456
and it's not clear
what he's communicating,

00:21.543 --> 00:22.718
but Jamie is a genius.

00:22.805 --> 00:23.980
There's my homework!

00:25.199 --> 00:26.243
What?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.593
I do my homework
once in a while.

Once every six months,

01:07.719 --> 01:10.113
Mom wakes us up at 5:00 a.m.,
shoves us into the car,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.115
and makes us go
to the outlet stores.

01:12.202 --> 01:15.553
I tell you, I am never
disappointed in Value Village.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.513
No other place in the county has
such a selection of irregulars.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.646
Are these made in some country
where people aren't symmetrical?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.170
Stop complaining.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.823
If it weren't for Value Village,
most of this family

01:24.910 --> 01:26.477
would have to run around naked.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.958
That place is all that
separates us from the apes.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.753
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.929
What? I was not!
You look great!

01:44.016 --> 01:47.455
The Paysons Outlet has 48-packs
of paper towels for half price.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.804
I wish we had more room
in this car.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.022
I knew we should have put

01:50.110 --> 01:51.459
the rack on top...

01:51.546 --> 01:52.938
What's wrong
with all of you?

01:53.025 --> 01:55.724
We're just thinking about
all those towels, honey.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.118
I mean, you're not the only
one who loves a bargain.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.336

02:02.078 --> 02:03.514
[Lois sighs]

02:03.601 --> 02:05.212
[TV shuts off]

02:05.299 --> 02:06.648
-Come on!
-What are you doing?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.431
Saving your minds
from turning into mush.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.173
You've been sitting on that
couch watching TV for hours.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.653
So what?
There's nothing else to do.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.437
There's never anything
to do around here.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.091
Because you have
no imaginations because you sit

02:15.178 --> 02:16.658
in front of that idiot box
all day long.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.094
HAL:
Your mother's right.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.096
It's a sad day when
three healthy boys

02:20.183 --> 02:22.316
can't think of anything to do
with a beautiful Saturday.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.013
You could take a walk,
you could

02:24.100 --> 02:26.189
roll a hoop, you can start
a rock collection. There.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.495
That's three ideas
in five seconds.

02:27.582 --> 02:28.931
I hope you're embarrassed.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.759
You boys have no idea
how lucky you are.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.282
The day will come
where you won't be

02:32.369 --> 02:33.718
able to complain about
having nothing to do.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.459
HAL:
That's right.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.635
You'll have responsibilities
and a career and children.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.725
And then you'll ask yourself,
"Hey, where's my boredom now?"

02:40.812 --> 02:42.336
All right, all right,
just stop lecturing us!

02:43.685 --> 02:47.297
God forbid those three should
have to make their own fun.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.000
I hate to admit it,
but Mom challenged us

02:55.087 --> 02:58.613
to use our creativity,
and I think we're better for it.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.441
How much time do we have
before the lights come on?

03:00.528 --> 03:01.877
We've got a few minutes.

03:01.964 --> 03:05.054
Let's give her crazy
eyes, Dracula fangs,

03:05.141 --> 03:07.099
and a giant fart cloud.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.579
Eh. Feels done.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.015
We went to all the trouble
to get up here.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.321
Let's really think about...

03:11.408 --> 03:12.627
Reese!

03:14.716 --> 03:16.021
What are you writing?

03:16.108 --> 03:18.415
"I want Reese."

03:18.502 --> 03:21.070
Come on. You know
she's thinking it.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.289
How are we supposed
to get away with this

03:22.376 --> 03:23.551
if you put your name
up there?

03:23.638 --> 03:25.030
Relax. We're miles
from our house.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.423
Nobody here knows us.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.568
Oh, my God!

03:40.655 --> 03:42.265
Did you hear something?

03:42.352 --> 03:44.136
LOIS:
What are you boys
doing up there?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.747
It's Mom!

03:45.834 --> 03:47.488
How'd she know
where to find us?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.925
I told you she's got tracking
devices in our fillings!

03:50.012 --> 03:51.753
If you two geniuses had
ripped them out like I did,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.102
we wouldn't be
in this mess!

03:53.189 --> 03:54.843
Maybe she didn't see us.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.411
Reese, Malcolm, Dewey,
you get down here this instant!

03:57.498 --> 03:59.239
[ with bad Spanish accent]:
Missus, I don't know

03:59.326 --> 04:00.936
who you are
thinking we are.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.982
Your boys are very different
boys than we are being.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.593
Oh, no!

04:06.811 --> 04:08.117
Where's the back
door on this thing?

04:08.204 --> 04:09.640
It's a billboard!

04:09.727 --> 04:12.426
We are so dead!
This time she'll finish us!

04:12.513 --> 04:13.688
What are we gonna do?!

04:13.775 --> 04:15.124
Oh, God! Oh, God!

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
Why do billboards
have to be so visible?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.519
Come down now!

04:19.607 --> 04:21.043
Reese, give me
your pocket knife.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.392
Okay... but if
you miss her,

04:22.479 --> 04:24.307
you'll only make
her madder.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.270
What are you doing?

04:30.357 --> 04:31.749
Hold on. I know that look.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.577
He's using his brain.

04:34.578 --> 04:38.234
We can't come down
because we are...

04:38.321 --> 04:41.368
protesting this offensive
depiction of women!

04:41.455 --> 04:43.283
-What?!
-What?!

04:43.370 --> 04:45.502
We've come up here to make
a difference in the world!

04:45.589 --> 04:47.287
Yeah!

04:47.374 --> 04:50.159
To speak for women like this one
who can't speak for themselves!

04:50.246 --> 04:52.379
Yeah, because
they're billboards!

04:52.466 --> 04:54.381
Shut up.
We're not coming down until

04:54.468 --> 04:56.557
women everywhere get
the respect they deserve!

04:56.644 --> 04:58.515
No matter how long it takes,

04:58.602 --> 05:00.474
we're staying up here!

05:00.561 --> 05:01.779
Oh, for the love of God.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.391
I don't know who
you think you're fooling.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.609
It's about time!

05:05.696 --> 05:06.871
Thank you, boys!

05:06.958 --> 05:09.134
God bless you!

05:09.221 --> 05:10.440
[clamoring voices]

05:10.527 --> 05:11.746
REESE:
Oh, no.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.051
She's talking to the cops.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.705
Wait. That's good.
If she gets ahold of us,

05:14.792 --> 05:16.751
she'll have to beat us
within the law.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.057
All these people showing up
is making her madder and madder.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.233
Why didn't we just climb down
right away?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.626
What were you thinking?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.106
I don't know. I panicked.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.586
I want to know what
you're going to do

05:25.673 --> 05:26.978
to get my boys down.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.371
It's a complicated
situation, ma'am.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.112
We have very specific guidelines

05:30.199 --> 05:32.767
for how to deal
with political protesters.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.812
They're not
political protesters.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.162
Those boys don't give a damn
about women's rights!

05:37.249 --> 05:40.296
If they did, they'd clean up
their rooms once in a while!

05:40.383 --> 05:43.081
-This is hooliganism!
-Sorry it took me so long.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.822
Eight different baby-sitters
turned me down.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.737
Do you know Jamie's
on a website?

05:46.824 --> 05:49.000
-Where are the boys?
-I told you.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.959
Oh, good God!

05:51.046 --> 05:52.613
I thought it was a metaphor.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.050
I'm sure you have ladders.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.139
I'm sure you have
people who climb them.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.054
So get one of them up there

05:59.141 --> 06:01.056
and get my children down!

06:01.143 --> 06:03.537
Ma'am, let me explain something
about the Police Commissioner.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.365
This is an election year.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.497
We've had a lot of unflattering
video on the news lately.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.629
The Chang case,

06:08.716 --> 06:09.934
the Jefferson case,

06:10.021 --> 06:11.240
the Rodriguez case.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.373
All he has left
is the white vote.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.940
So he's not going to let
a bunch of video cameras

06:16.027 --> 06:17.812
tape us manhandling
those children.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.249
But if there's anything
else that we can do for you...

06:20.336 --> 06:21.816
Yeah, how about
you call a cop?

06:21.903 --> 06:22.904
[chuckles]
Sorry, Officer.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.253
It's not you, it's me.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.298
I have a severe
gambling problem.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.039
Lost the house
playing Pai Gow.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.085
She's a saint.
Would you excuse us a moment?

06:30.172 --> 06:31.521
Honey, calm down.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.783
You know what pepper
spray feels like.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.524
Let's just give it
an hour or two.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.179
When these people lose interest,
and the crowd disperses,

06:37.266 --> 06:39.442
we'll get the boys down.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.230
REPORTER:
That's right, Steven.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.189
I'm here at the scene of
this dramatic demonstration...

06:47.276 --> 06:49.017
In an age of cynicism
when it's said

06:49.104 --> 06:51.672
that young people don't care
about the important issues...

06:51.759 --> 06:54.283
These three youngsters seem
to have struck a nerve among

06:54.370 --> 06:56.198
like-minded citizens
who've had enough

06:56.285 --> 06:57.982
of this degrading
depiction of women.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.811
Lois, did you see
all the news vans?

07:00.898 --> 07:04.162
Lyle at 7:00 told me
to get out of his shot.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.860
He is one handsome man.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.644
Over here we have
the proud mother

07:07.731 --> 07:09.341
of these three
young protesters.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431
What do you want the nation
to know about your boys?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.520
No comment.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.305
So you must be the father?

07:16.392 --> 07:18.568
Can we get some
comment from you?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.570
I-I don't know that
I really want to sound off.

07:20.657 --> 07:23.225
How do you account for your
sons' extraordinary sensitivity

07:23.312 --> 07:25.096
to women's issues?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
Well, Dinah, in our house

07:26.576 --> 07:28.839
we emphasize the rights
of all people.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.145
I've tried to pass along

07:30.232 --> 07:32.539
what I like to call
"core values."

07:32.626 --> 07:37.239
Equality, respect,
compassion, nutrition.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.547
We have something called
the Clean Plate Club.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.375
What's that cop doing?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.899
I think he's
throwing something.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.075
Oh, my God!

07:48.946 --> 07:51.122
-What is it?
-It's a cell phone.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.602
[phone rings]

07:52.689 --> 07:54.691
Hello.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.476
-Hello.
-Mom?

07:56.563 --> 07:59.043
Before you say anything,
I want you to listen carefully.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.828
There are a couple ways
we can handle this.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.351
If you come down right now,

08:02.438 --> 08:04.788
I can go as low as
three weeks in your room.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.486
If there's no more trouble,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.575
you get two meals a day
and enough light to read by.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.751
You should think about this
very carefully,

08:10.838 --> 08:13.667
but you've only got ten minutes
until this offer expires.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.974
Then all bets are off.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.892
Oh, my God.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.677
I know.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.462
She's negotiating.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.334
She's never negotiated
anything before.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.727
We found a weakness.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.817
All these people
and the TV cameras.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.645
She must be scared.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.429
I didn't think
this was possible.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.823
Suddenly, she looks so small.

08:42.870 --> 08:46.003
People, the battle before us
may be long,

08:46.090 --> 08:47.222
but we will not stop

08:47.309 --> 08:48.440
until we end the oppression!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.355
Women of the world...

08:50.442 --> 08:51.313
unite!

08:51.400 --> 08:52.401
[applause and cheering]

09:13.422 --> 09:15.642
I am their mother,
and I say this has
gone on long enough!

09:15.729 --> 09:17.078
Don't you have snipers

09:17.165 --> 09:18.819
with tranquilizer guns,
or a giant net?!

09:18.906 --> 09:20.516
What do I pay taxes for?

09:20.603 --> 09:21.604
HAL:
Now, the life

09:21.691 --> 09:23.475
of a crusader is
not an easy one

09:23.563 --> 09:24.825
but, once that
fire is lit,

09:24.912 --> 09:26.522
there is no
putting it out.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.743
Feminism must be very important
to your boys.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.222
Meryl, please!

09:31.309 --> 09:33.224
They're not my "boys."
They're my children.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.792
If you feel the need to label
them, I'm sorry for you.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.098
It's high time we showed

09:37.185 --> 09:39.013
a national audience...

09:39.100 --> 09:40.928
[ softly]:
This is national?

09:42.059 --> 09:43.060
...that we're still

09:43.147 --> 09:45.106
producing heroes
in this country,

09:45.193 --> 09:46.150
and three of them

09:46.237 --> 09:48.065
are up there!

09:48.152 --> 09:51.547
[applause and cheering]

09:51.634 --> 09:52.853
It's your sons, ma'am.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.725
Well, you're cutting it
awfully close.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.161
I gave you ten minutes,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.685
and you've taken nearly
nine and a half.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
We decided we're
not coming down.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.775
What?!

10:01.862 --> 10:03.037
We discussed it
as a family.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.778
See, we figure you're as mad now

10:04.865 --> 10:06.475
as you possibly can ever get.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.911
We've reached the point
where nothing we do

10:07.998 --> 10:09.739
can make it any worse.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.785
So every hour we stay up here
is another hour of freedom.

10:11.872 --> 10:15.310
Plus another 30 or 40 supporters
added to our fan base.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.965
Malcolm, let's
set aside the fact

10:18.052 --> 10:19.662
that you know
you've done wrong.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.838
Let's ignore that you're
pretending to have

10:21.925 --> 10:24.536
principles you don't have
just to get out of it.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.104
You have to come down sometime.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.715
And life is long.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.499
That's what's nice
about being young.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.414
We really don't think
that far ahead.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.372
This whole thing's been
kind of eye-opening.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.331
If nothing else,
we've all had a lesson

10:36.418 --> 10:38.115
on the ephemeral
nature of power.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.900
Power's a funny thing.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.076
It's when you think you have it
that you're in trouble.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.165
Valid point.
Historically.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.906
But on a philosophical
level, Mom...

10:45.993 --> 10:48.604
we've already won.
We're free.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.563
And no matter what happens
tonight, we both know it.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.230
I think it's getting
cold up here.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.755
I don't think
we should do this anymore.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.192
I don't know
who we think we're kidding.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.237
We're not going
to be able to win this.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.717
Dewey, don't look into her eyes!

11:14.804 --> 11:15.544
Huh?

11:15.631 --> 11:17.241
What just happened?

11:17.328 --> 11:19.374
Damn it.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.637
I remember my mother,
smart as any man,

11:21.724 --> 11:23.813
down on her knees
in the kitchen,

11:23.900 --> 11:26.033
scrubbing that floor
till it shined.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.817
I think I was seven
when I made a promise

11:27.904 --> 11:29.384
to myself and to all women...

11:29.471 --> 11:30.341
-Hal?
-Yes.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.561
Oh, my God.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.171
I saw you
on TV tonight,

11:34.258 --> 11:36.565
and I couldn't
believe it was you,

11:36.652 --> 11:38.219
but you kept talking

11:38.306 --> 11:39.742
and talking
and talking,

11:39.829 --> 11:42.397
and I realized
it had to be you.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.746
Wendy...

11:43.833 --> 11:45.095
How long's it been?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.662
23 years, Hal.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.404
You know, I remember
the last time I saw you

11:49.491 --> 11:50.971
down to the day
and the minute.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.929
I can tell you exactly
where I was standing...

11:53.016 --> 11:54.583
Wendy, that was so long ago.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.281
I've got a whole new life now.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.414
You can't just
come here and expect...

11:59.501 --> 12:01.285
Promises were made, Hal.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.418
And now
that I found you,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.333
I'm not just gonna go away.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.815
Look, I know
that there are some issues

12:08.902 --> 12:10.381
that probably
need resolving...

12:10.468 --> 12:12.383
[shrieks]

12:12.470 --> 12:15.082
Listen, honey, let's get a cup
of coffee way over there.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.780
No. I have an idea.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.741
-Is this going up to the boys?
-Yes, it's some baked goods,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.481
some jackets
for when it gets cold...

12:23.568 --> 12:24.656
and my phone number.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.051
Oh, this is wonderful.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
You certainly went
to a lot of trouble.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.752
My boys are just going to be so
appreciative of your kindness.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.279
I think the Green Valley
Women's Collective

12:38.366 --> 12:40.977
makes better banana bread
than the Feminists for Change.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.413
According
to the wrapper,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.502
we're the first male hands
to touch this.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.767
You know, except for Mom
and Dad and Francis and Jamie,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.943
I think this has really
brought our family together.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.379
Ooh.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.816
What are you doing?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.687
-What?
-You know what.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.689
Why do you get
the one with the cherry?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.039
I just grabbed one.
I don't care.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.736
If you don't care,
then let me have it.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.346
I already took it.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.305
Hey, I'm here, too.
I want the cherry.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.610
You always
do this.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.264
You only want it
because I have it.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.613
I don't care what you have.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.964
Reese, you're not
the center of everything.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.967
Wait.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.187
Why would they only put
a cherry on one cupcake?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.538
This is Mom.

13:23.193 --> 13:27.110
There may be those who will try
to drive a wedge between us.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.285
But if we learn

13:28.372 --> 13:29.634
nothing else tonight,

13:29.721 --> 13:32.376
we will learn to stand together!

13:32.463 --> 13:33.769
[cheering]

13:38.165 --> 13:40.471
Damn it.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.867
We have a pretty
sweet deal up here.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.434
Food, drinks.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.349
Every one of our needs
is being taken care of.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.046
Every one.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.833
Man, they better stop
sending up bran muffins.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.706
Hey! You may want
to burn thisbasket!

13:57.793 --> 13:59.055
How are the books
they gave us?

13:59.142 --> 14:01.797
The feminist joke book's
a little ham-fisted,

14:01.884 --> 14:03.581
but these fairy tales
are interesting.

14:03.668 --> 14:04.669
In this one,

14:04.756 --> 14:05.932
Cinderella tells
the Prince

14:06.019 --> 14:07.759
he's sapping her
woman-strength,

14:07.847 --> 14:10.371
and she pushes him aside
to create a matriarchy

14:10.458 --> 14:12.025
with fluid
gender roles.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.635
Can you believe these cows

14:13.722 --> 14:15.158
actually think
we're on their side?

14:15.245 --> 14:16.290
WOMAN:
We love you, boys!

14:16.377 --> 14:17.552
Right on, sister!

14:17.639 --> 14:19.641
Check out that pig.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.599
You don't have to talk
about them like that.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.166
They've been
really nice to us.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.429
Yeah, and they really
believe in this stuff.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.301
That is such a load.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.738
Every woman down there is just
here because they're jealous.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.522
Of what?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.872
Of the fact that they're
not hot enough to be strippers.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.612
They act like
they're all offended,

14:34.699 --> 14:37.224
but really they're just mad
about their own giant butts.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.356
Believe me,
in their heart of hearts,

14:39.443 --> 14:42.011
every woman wants to be her.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.230
What about Mom?

14:43.317 --> 14:44.622
We're not talking
about moms.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.711
We're talking
about women.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.017
So all women want
to be strippers?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.801
There are no women
in the world

14:49.889 --> 14:52.717
who want to be doctors or
lawyers or anything like that?

14:52.804 --> 14:54.763
Cut the act, Malcolm.
They can't hear you.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.199
Just because they look like dogs

14:56.286 --> 14:57.592
doesn't mean
they hear like dogs.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.160
I'm sleeping
on the other side.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.685
Come on, I was just
being honest!

15:03.772 --> 15:05.426

[singsong voice]
Reese.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.121
Hi.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.905
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.473
-Really?
-Yeah, sugar.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.302
I had to wait for your
brothers to go to sleep.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.825
You don't want
to share me, do you?

15:56.912 --> 15:58.305
Everyone's mad at me.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.089
Malcolm and Dewey
think I'm a jerk.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.222
You're not a jerk.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.615
You're just little.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.661
I think you're cute as a bug.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.446
Do you want me to kiss you?

16:09.533 --> 16:12.493
Uh... yes, ma'am.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.631
Wow.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.894
Damn tootin', wow.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.203
So, will you take off
your giant top?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.118
Do you have a giant dollar?

16:29.205 --> 16:31.033
I'll get a whole bunch
if you'll come back again.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.905
I'll come back every night
if you want.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.385
You're so great.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.387
The girls at school
won't even talk to me.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.086
Listen, if they're
not willing to talk to you,

16:40.173 --> 16:43.872
or dance on a pole,
they're not really your friends.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.178
You don't need them.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.614
You have me.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.224
I'm perfect.

16:48.311 --> 16:51.097
I'm the only woman
in the world for you, Reese.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.012
-You are?
-Of course.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.926
I'm 60 feet tall.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.624
My skin is five inches thick.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.495
No matter how creepy

16:58.582 --> 17:02.151
and insensitive and thoughtless
you are, you can't hurt me.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.848
That's all I ever wanted.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.069
Why aren't all women like you?

17:07.156 --> 17:10.290
Well, I'm not real, sugar.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.900
Oh, yeah.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.207
You just dreamed me up
as a super-sexy way

17:14.294 --> 17:16.470
to face the fact
that you're going to live

17:16.557 --> 17:17.949
the rest of your life alone.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.952
But that's not for sure,
is it?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.432
And you know the saddest part?

17:22.519 --> 17:24.652
You're gonna wake up
before you can think

17:24.739 --> 17:26.828
of anything really good
to do with me.

17:26.915 --> 17:27.959
Wait.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.526
We can't just give up on this.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.093
Wait!

17:31.180 --> 17:32.660
Don't leave me.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.663
Don't leave me!

17:37.404 --> 17:39.275
Right now the mother
of the protesters

17:39.362 --> 17:42.278
is with the Police Commissioner,
pleading for her brave boys

17:42.365 --> 17:45.803
whose sacrifice continues
to inspire so many.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.631
Those boys are like dogs.

17:47.718 --> 17:48.937
I have to get them
on their backs

17:49.024 --> 17:50.504
just to reestablish
my dominance.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.289
Look, this whole protest
thing is a lie anyway.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.986
They don't
believe a word of it.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.293
If it's an issue of liability,
I'll sign any waiver.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.642
Just get them
down here!

17:58.729 --> 18:00.688
Do I appear to look concerned?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.037
What?

18:02.124 --> 18:03.647
Yeah, sure,
you look concerned.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.084
Oh, thank God.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.955
My handlers say that
I don't pull it off.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.652
Can't do the mouth.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.699
I want those boys down.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.136
Believe me, there is nothing
I would like more

18:14.223 --> 18:17.835
than to tear 'em down
and crack a few heads.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.533
But, in an election year,

18:19.620 --> 18:21.709
we all have to make sacrifices.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.799
You know, this whole thing
brings me back to my days

18:24.886 --> 18:25.974
on the Freedom Ride.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.323
It's fantastic.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.412
-We're getting an injunction.
-What?

18:29.499 --> 18:31.762
The ACLU found a judge
who's completely sympathetic

18:31.849 --> 18:33.199
to what your boys
are doing.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.462
In two hours, we'll have
an airtight court order,

18:35.549 --> 18:38.073
and your boys can stay up
there for days, even weeks.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.863
Excuse me. I have
something to say.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.260
I want the world to know
how proud I am of my boys

18:51.347 --> 18:53.958
for making this statement,
despite the wind and the cold

18:54.045 --> 18:56.265
and little Dewey's
medical condition.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.963
And I want to thank
the Police Commissioner

18:59.050 --> 19:01.444
for letting my son stay up
there, even if it means

19:01.531 --> 19:03.533
rolling the dice
on a diabetic coma.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.884
It's nice to see someone
who cares about principles

19:06.971 --> 19:09.713
more than they care about
the life of a little boy.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.019
Get 'em down.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.247
[ gasps]

19:21.334 --> 19:22.987
Malcolm! Reese!

19:23.074 --> 19:24.989
Oh, my God!

19:25.076 --> 19:26.556
We'll have you in your mother's
arms in a minute, little Dewey!

19:26.643 --> 19:29.733
No!

19:29.820 --> 19:32.171
Excuse me.
Are you Hal's wife?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.520
-Yeah. This is, uh...
-There's something you need
to know about your husband.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.564
We both worked

19:34.651 --> 19:35.783
at the Tiger Shop
at Macy's.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.959
One night he got
me drunk and...

19:38.046 --> 19:40.483
borrowed $400 from me!

19:40.570 --> 19:42.093
What?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
He bought a velour suit
and faked his own death

19:44.270 --> 19:46.924
to get out of paying me back.
He actually blew up
a phone booth.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.797
I figure, with interest,
it comes to about ten grand.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.146
I'm sorry, but...

19:51.233 --> 19:53.496
[booing]

19:58.240 --> 20:00.677
Hey! Hey, everybody!

20:00.764 --> 20:04.246
You can take us down, but first
I have something to say.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.163
I realized something up here.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.557
This woman is beautiful,
she's sexy,

20:10.644 --> 20:13.342
and perfect and gigantic,
but you know what?

20:13.429 --> 20:14.952
She isn't real.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.087
If she was real,
she'd be different.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.697
I know that, if I was real,

20:20.784 --> 20:22.743
I'd want people to listen to me.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.963
I'd want people to care
about what I think
and not ignore me.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.923
I guess what these protesters
are trying to say

20:29.010 --> 20:30.838
is that women-- real women--

20:30.925 --> 20:33.406
aren't that different
from regular people.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.799
They want the same
things that men want.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.759
Only men don't have to hold
a big protest to get them.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.152
And women shouldn't
have to either.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.417
[smattering of applause]

20:48.072 --> 20:50.205
Well, I'm very
proud of you boys.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.643
Let's go home where I can truly
express how I'm feeling.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.167
I've had six hours to figure out

20:56.255 --> 20:59.258
all the horrible things
that are going to happen to you.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.565
You, I still
have to think about.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.440
Get him to Deaconess Diabetic
Center right away.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.006
Dad! Tell them
what's going on!

21:11.444 --> 21:13.707
-Tell them I'm not...
-He's fading!
Let's go! Let's go!

21:53.877 --> 21:55.836
