00:00.364 --> 00:01.950
<i>All right, darlings, pay attention,</i>

00:01.952 --> 00:03.002
<i>because you don't want to miss</i>

00:03.030 --> 00:05.171
<i>what these three
besties have been up to.</i>

00:05.248 --> 00:07.352
<i>Sutton took a big risk and left her job</i>

00:07.366 --> 00:09.561
<i>as the hardest-working
assistant in editorial</i>

00:09.596 --> 00:11.594
<i>to join "Scarlet's" fashion department.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.763
<i>But things with Richard,
a member of "Scarlet's" board</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:16.474
<i>and 15 years her senior,
were complicated.</i>

00:16.475 --> 00:18.935
<i>What they had was real
and really difficult.</i>

00:18.936 --> 00:21.020
Richard, hi!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.355
Hey, Sutton!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.357
<i>So she decided to end things.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:26.150
<i>But the heart wants what it wants,</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:28.319
<i>and that door may not be fully closed.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:31.841
<i>Jane finally got her dream job
and found her voice as a writer.</i>

00:31.899 --> 00:33.574
<i>With Jacqueline encouraging her,</i>

00:33.602 --> 00:37.269
<i>Jane became a shiny new star
in New York's media heavens.</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:40.915
<i>But then edgy Internet magazine
"Incite" came calling.</i>

00:40.916 --> 00:42.333
I was offered a job at "Incite,"

00:42.334 --> 00:45.127
<i>and I've decided to take it.</i>

00:45.128 --> 00:47.746
<i>Kat was killing it
as "Scarlet's" social media director,</i>

00:47.757 --> 00:49.966
<i>when she unexpectedly fell for Adena,</i>

00:49.967 --> 00:51.759
<i>a controversial artist
who opened Kat's eyes</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:52.914
<i>and heart.</i>

00:52.979 --> 00:55.596
<i>But Adena's visa troubles
kept her out of the country.</i>

00:55.597 --> 00:56.825
<i>After their missed connection,</i>

00:56.907 --> 00:59.225
<i>Kat realized there's
more to life than work</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:00.810
<i>and decided to follow
that big heart of hers</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:02.895
<i>back to Adena and around the world.</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:05.649
<i>So keep up, lovelies, because these
are the women of "The Bold Type."</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:30.214
We're nice people.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.632
Oh, my God! I see her!

01:31.633 --> 01:32.883
Where?

01:32.884 --> 01:34.343
Wait. No, never mind.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.845
Jane.
I know.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.430
You said no screaming. It just came out.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.314
I'm so excited to see her.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.565
So excited.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.361
If you masturbate on a plane,

01:52.362 --> 01:54.822
do they charge you for hijacking?

01:56.533 --> 01:59.368
Adjective to describe a smell.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.745
Gross.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.747
Hey! Jane, Sutton!

02:04.374 --> 02:05.791
Oh, my God, we missed you!

You are glowing.
Yeah.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.759
Oh, thank you.
The whole trip was incredible.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.844
Wait, so Adena is coming to New York,

02:16.845 --> 02:18.179
like, right now?
Yeah,

02:18.180 --> 02:19.430
she got on the last flight out,

02:19.431 --> 02:20.973
and her visa got
approved for three months

02:20.974 --> 02:22.933
while she looks for work,
which will be easy,

02:22.934 --> 02:24.185
'cause she's great.
Oh,

02:24.186 --> 02:27.521
"Scarlet" social media director
and international artist.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.065
You guys are officially
a gay power couple.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.566
Well, we kind of are, huh?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.943
Should I call Page Six?
I have never

02:32.944 --> 02:34.320
seen you like this!

02:34.321 --> 02:36.364
Uh, hello.
You are a goner!

02:36.365 --> 02:37.782
Bye.
You know what?

02:37.783 --> 02:39.700
Fine, yes, I'm a goner, whatever.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.285
I want everyone to know it.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.162
Excuse me? Hi, um,

02:43.163 --> 02:44.497
I don't know if you know this,

02:44.498 --> 02:46.332
but I have a girlfriend,
and she's amazing,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.334
and her name's Adena...
Okay, that's...

02:48.335 --> 02:49.835
enough of that.
What?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.295
We're not done with you yet.
Well, I'm not done

02:51.296 --> 02:53.339
with you either. I have questions.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.508
Have there been any
more Richard hookups?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.551
Mm, no. It was just the one.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.596
And it was closure sex.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.056
Okay, fine, it was twice.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.225
And anyway, we both love our jobs,

03:04.226 --> 03:07.353
and as long as we both work
at Safford, it's...

03:07.354 --> 03:10.606
I keep telling her she should just come
and work at "Incite" with me,

03:10.607 --> 03:12.400
but the fashion there's
a little more hoodie

03:12.401 --> 03:14.568
than haute couture,
so she's like, "No, dawg."

03:14.569 --> 03:16.112
Mm.
Oh!

03:16.113 --> 03:18.364
Can we add a stop? Delancey and Essex?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.532
Thank you so much.
Why?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.659
There's an Olivia Ruth VIP pop-up

03:21.660 --> 03:24.286
that I need to go to.
Gotta get a bag for Oliver.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.288
Huh. Right now, though?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.998
Your flight was delayed three hours.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.333
The pop-up store closes in 30 minutes,

03:29.334 --> 03:30.835
and then they put the bags on the floor

03:30.836 --> 03:32.336
for the masses to fight over.
Ew.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.963
The time is now.
Civilians?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.548
Ugh.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.092
Can you get us a discount?
Yes, but hurry up.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.306
I'm gonna try this on.
Yeah, I'm gonna try this.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.308
Maybe for the cover reveal party.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.396
So fancy!

03:49.397 --> 03:51.439
How cute is this?
Ugh...

03:51.440 --> 03:53.400
so cute.
Then I'm buying it.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.528
Oh... no.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.071
Oh.
Oh, no.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.531
No, you know what? It's stuck on your...

04:00.532 --> 04:02.491
Is that a hat?
I'm stuck.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.492
It's not, okay.
Help.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.119
I can't take you guys anywhere.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.495
No, it's stuck...

04:06.496 --> 04:08.122
Is that your ear?
No, it's my hair.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.540
Oh, sorry.
Just pull a little harder.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.169
Just... ow! Okay, just don't rip it.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.005
Hello, Jacqueline.
Ha-ha, very funny.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.464
Welcome back, Kat.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.800
Thank you so much.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.051

04:25.432 --> 04:27.391

Thank you, Ms. Carlyle.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.477
So your own vertical.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.312
That's a big responsibility.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.022
It is.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.149
I'm starting with a series called
"Feminist Army."

04:35.150 --> 04:38.319
It's gonna showcase millennial women
who are changing the world.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.070
And I met the most
incredible businesswoman.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.655
She's revolutionizing feminine hygiene,

04:41.656 --> 04:44.450
making it greener, safer, healthier...

04:44.451 --> 04:45.993
Jane.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.037
This isn't a pitch meeting.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.747
Right. Sorry, I...

04:49.748 --> 04:51.165
I'm just really excited.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.625
Of course, you should be.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.836
You know, I was sad
to see you leave "Scarlet."

04:57.464 --> 04:59.381
But what you're doing
over at "Incite"...

04:59.382 --> 05:01.509
celebrating smart, powerful women...

05:01.510 --> 05:03.385
is important.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.678
It's good for you.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.348
It's good for all of us.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.475
Thank you.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.768
I'll see you ladies tomorrow.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.020
Bye!
See you.

Hello, Internet!

05:22.489 --> 05:26.992
We're back! And it's a beautiful,
freezing cold day in New York!

05:26.993 --> 05:29.829
Look at this!
Come on, no more videos.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.248
Let me post just this one.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.375
Forget about posting. Come back to bed.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.918
You can finish

05:35.919 --> 05:37.878
what you started last night.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.047
You know, I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.507
This is my first day back at "Scarlet"!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.384
Mm-mm.
Maybe, uh,

05:43.385 --> 05:44.718
you should come by the office

05:44.719 --> 05:47.096
and have lunch with me later.
Okay.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.139
I'll see you then.
Yeah.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.559
Cool. Gotta go!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.520
Get ready to own this town.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.153
Yeah, so at first, I was just, you know,

06:03.154 --> 06:04.864
throwing up for what seemed like hours.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.240
But then it started to settle,

06:06.241 --> 06:08.325
and I went on this incredible journey.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.578
I was actually able
to go into my own body

06:10.579 --> 06:11.871
and hug my own heart.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.039
Whoa. Ayahuasca's so intense.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.499
Yeah, I barfed and farted
at the same time.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.251
I'm basically a shaman now.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.461
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.463
Oh.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.173
Are we good here?
It's a little weird,

06:23.174 --> 06:24.633
but we're playing it cool.
Okay.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.635
She is back!

06:26.636 --> 06:28.554
Hey, Alex!

06:28.555 --> 06:30.180
Wow!

06:30.181 --> 06:33.559
Oh, my God. Things are happening here
that are very...

06:33.560 --> 06:36.395
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.730
I like it.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.773
"Scarlet's" finally rubbing off on you.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.483
Well, something like that.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.985
Hey, Sutton. Where should we take

06:42.986 --> 06:44.653
the dresses for the
Rachel Antonoff shoot?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.697
The fashion department.
I have to steam them.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.616
Thanks, guys.
Hey, uh,

06:48.617 --> 06:51.493
Jacqueline wants me to write this story
on the most effective profile pictures.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.037
I'm gonna need a few looks.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.705
Do you have the time to style it for me?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.832
Yeah! I always have time
for a styling credit.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.542
Cool! I'll reserve the studio.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.295
Great to have you back.
Red!

07:01.296 --> 07:03.005
I'm drowning in Rachel Antonoff

07:03.006 --> 07:05.007
fallopian tube sweaters.
Please, help me.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.217
You know, they're uteruses as well, um,

07:07.218 --> 07:08.677
the entire female reproductive system...

07:08.678 --> 07:10.512
Red, I know. I've been with one.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.097
Or two. I can't remember.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.682
It was the '90s. I don't know.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.353
Kat! My office?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.688
Okay.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.943
Well, I really appreciate
you giving me the time off,

07:24.944 --> 07:26.945
especially on such short notice.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.573
When you asked to go,
it was pretty clear to me

07:29.574 --> 07:31.700
that this was about more
than needing a vacation.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.285
Yeah, it was.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.330
And while I was gone, it hit me.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.208
Everything that matters to me
is because of "Scarlet."

07:39.209 --> 07:41.835
Adena, my two best friends, my career...

07:41.836 --> 07:45.047
And now that I am back,
I'm ready to kick ass for you.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.590
Well, that is great news, Kat.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.217
And I'm glad

07:48.218 --> 07:49.760
that you're recharged, because building

07:49.761 --> 07:52.596
the social media department
is gonna be a lot of work.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.099
Staffing alone is gonna be
incredibly time-consuming.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.644
I am getting a finalized staffing budget
this week. In the meantime,

07:58.645 --> 07:59.770
I'm putting together
what my needs will be.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.231
Great. And there is one other thing.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.734
We recently did some in-depth research
on the numbers for the dot-com,

08:05.735 --> 08:08.612
and the results were disappointing.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.699
The board is meeting this afternoon
to discuss a possible relaunch,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.534
and I'd like you to sit in.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.203
Okay, I'll be there.
Great.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.747
No problem. You're welcome, bye.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.791
Carolina Herrera's office called.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.418
She wants to confirm
that Karlie is wearing

08:22.419 --> 08:23.919
the Tanya Taffeta skirt

08:23.920 --> 08:25.671
to the cover reveal
party tomorrow night.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.423
I can confirm that
she's wearing Carolina

08:27.424 --> 08:30.259
on the cover, but who can say
what she'll show up wearing tomorrow?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.679
You know, I can't control models
any more than I can control my moods.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.264
Just kidding.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.599
Mood stabilizers keeping
me steady as she goes.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
I'll let her know.
She'll have to wait.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.438
It's sexual harassment time.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.315
The seminar... You guys get what I mean.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.526
Let's go.
So...

08:47.527 --> 08:51.447
do not forget, it does not matter
what your intention was.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.826
It matters how it makes the subject
of the intention of the joke feel.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.621
I know "Scarlet" has made some changes
to their corporate policy.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.791
Richard Hunter, house counsel,
is going to speak to that.

09:05.754 --> 09:09.798
So given the rapidly changing world
we now live in

09:09.799 --> 09:11.592
and our recent corporate merger,

09:11.593 --> 09:12.971
the board has decided

09:13.006 --> 09:14.946
to review our sexual harassment policy.

09:15.513 --> 09:19.308
In that process, we realized
that there is far too much gray area.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.226
So new policy.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.936
If two staffers engage in any type

09:22.937 --> 09:25.689
of romantic relationship,
they need to report it

09:25.690 --> 09:27.608
to Human Resources

09:27.609 --> 09:30.611
and fill out a consensual
relationship agreement.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.446
Now, it's a legal document stating...

09:32.447 --> 09:33.697
yes, you guessed it...

09:33.698 --> 09:37.034
that the relationship is consensual.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.118
What are you doing?

09:38.119 --> 09:40.496
Uh... yes?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.664
So, um...

09:42.665 --> 09:45.084
if... if two employees want to date

09:45.085 --> 09:47.586
who work at different departments

09:47.587 --> 09:49.338
or at different levels of the company,

09:49.339 --> 09:51.131
they can without any issue?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.758
Correct.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.762
What if they're at, like,
way different levels?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.263
I'm gonna kill you.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.224
They need to go to HR.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.560
They'll review the agreement with you
and your partner, separately.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.020
Then you sign the contract

10:05.021 --> 10:06.772
saying that the relationship
is consensual,

10:06.773 --> 10:09.233
and you are free to date.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.863
That's all the time we have today.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
If you have any further questions,

10:16.491 --> 10:19.827
swing by my office.
My door's always open.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.662
Good. Thank you, everyone.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.710

10:58.783 --> 11:00.534
Guys, our numbers were down last week.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.452
I don't like to see that.
So surprise me this week.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.580
I want out-of-the-box thinking, okay?

11:04.581 --> 11:05.706
Adam, go.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.040
Un-banking.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.917
It's not just for anarchists anymore.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.878
With the growing distrust
of the federal government,

11:10.879 --> 11:12.838
middle-class families
are starting to un-bank.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.716
I'm only interested if the middle class
are becoming anarchists.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.800
I'll find out.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.802
All right, Jane.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.012
You've had a week to settle in.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.681
Time to push you out of the nest
and launch your vertical. Talk to me.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.725
Okay, um...

11:24.726 --> 11:27.060
so as you know,
I want to feature young women

11:27.061 --> 11:29.313
who are changing the world,
and my first subject

11:29.314 --> 11:30.856
is Emma Cox.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.651
She is the CEO, or "she-E-O"...

11:36.321 --> 11:39.656
of OTR, which stands for "Off the Rag."

11:39.657 --> 11:41.451
They make menstrual cups.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.538
Menstrual cups are like a...
a diaphragm.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.248
You buy one, and you reuse it.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.958
They're becoming way
more popular than tampons

11:49.959 --> 11:51.543
among millennials.
Wait.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.878
Who here uses cups?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.046
I don't.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.090
I make my own tampons. They're organic.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.926
Right, um...

11:58.927 --> 12:00.928
Look, Emma is 29,

12:00.929 --> 12:02.888
and she's taken OTR
from a small start-up

12:02.889 --> 12:04.306
to a million-dollar company.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.141
And for every OTR cup sold,

12:06.142 --> 12:07.935
the company donates one
to a homeless shelter.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.854
Why this story? I'm just not seeing it.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.315
I came to "Incite" to write stories

12:13.316 --> 12:15.359
that inspire and challenge.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.071
And Emma Cox is the
embodiment of that message.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.699
Very well. It's your vertical,

12:22.700 --> 12:23.825
and I like your passion.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.079
Go write it.

12:28.373 --> 12:32.167
Hi.
Mr. Hunter, hi.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.753
About what you were, um, saying...

12:34.754 --> 12:35.921
At the seminar, right.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.922
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.675
Thank you.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.052
Were you...
Talking about us? Yes.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.929
This new policy changes everything.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.765
It can't be that simple.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.102
I was just as skeptical
when it came across my desk.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.895
But as of yesterday,

12:51.896 --> 12:54.649
this is the new company policy.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.901
I want us to be together.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.009
And we can be.

12:59.062 --> 13:00.936
There is nothing standing
in our way anymore.

13:01.022 --> 13:04.324
Nobody has to leave their job.
No more hiding.

13:04.325 --> 13:08.245
We can make plans,
go to dinners, vacations...

13:08.246 --> 13:10.289
We could walk into a party together.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.124
We could walk out of a party together.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.920
I miss you.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
I want us to be together.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.923
Don't you?

13:19.924 --> 13:21.842
I do.

13:22.754 --> 13:24.386
<i>Emma, I think what you're doing here</i>

13:24.387 --> 13:27.014
is so amazing, and you were integral

13:27.015 --> 13:28.849
to the repeal of the
pink tax in New York,

13:28.850 --> 13:31.560
that taxes tampons as a luxury good.

13:31.561 --> 13:35.063
Was activism always a part
of your vision for OTR?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.440
Yeah.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.192
I love that a customer
can buy an OTR cup

13:39.193 --> 13:41.236
and feel good because she knows

13:41.237 --> 13:45.240
a homeless woman is gonna benefit
from her purchase. I'm proud of that.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.658
Yeah, I get that.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.119
And, I mean, the publicity doesn't hurt.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.413
Well, yeah.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.416
I was a millennial woman
walking into investor meetings

13:54.417 --> 13:57.335
asking for money for a company
that makes menstrual cups

13:57.336 --> 13:59.921
and wants to give half
of them away for free.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.675
Yeah, either you're really crazy,
or you're really brave.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.260
Both.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.429
Well, I think that a lot of young women

14:07.430 --> 14:09.598
are gonna be inspired by
how you run your business

14:09.599 --> 14:11.058
and the choices you're making.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.726
I know I am.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.938
Oh, okay, we're doing this.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.734
Yeah, so basically
that entire presentation

14:20.735 --> 14:23.320
really was for me.
Or was it to address

14:23.321 --> 14:25.947
the very real epidemic of
workplace sexual harassment?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.657
Yes, also that, but can we just stick

14:27.658 --> 14:29.326
with what's happening,
because I'm freaking out?

14:29.327 --> 14:33.038
And Jane needs to be here!
Oh, yes! On it! Okay.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.085
Oh, my God! Hi!
<i>Jane... hey!</i>

14:38.086 --> 14:40.253
Aww, you guys are in the
fashion closet without me!

14:40.254 --> 14:42.839
<i>Yes, we are. And we have some hot goss</i>

14:42.840 --> 14:44.091
<i>about Richard. Go ahead, honey.</i>

14:44.092 --> 14:45.842
Oh, you're frozen. Hello?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.469
Can you see me?
Jane?

14:47.470 --> 14:49.096
Jane?
Nope.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.430
Go over in the corner.
The service is better.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.724
Okay, we're coming. Hold on. Hold...

14:52.725 --> 14:55.143
Okay, is that better?
No, it's super not.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.270
Oh...
No, I can see you!

14:57.271 --> 14:58.688
<i>Hello?</i>
I can see you.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.774
Can you see me?

15:00.775 --> 15:01.983
What about Richard?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.613
Okay, this isn't working.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.740
I will text her every detail.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.784
Just tell me what's going on.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.453
Richard signed the agreement.
He wants to go public.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.163
He is all in.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.543
Oh, my God, it's like an episode
of "That Girl." It's so romantic!

15:20.534 --> 15:21.461
Right?

15:21.462 --> 15:24.172
Yeah, no... I mean yes.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.674
Yes.

15:25.675 --> 15:29.719
We've had this huge obstacle
in our way for so long,

15:29.720 --> 15:31.304
and now it's just gone. I-I'm just...

15:31.305 --> 15:32.722
I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.224
Well, nothing's simple.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.143
I mean, my relationship
is completely controlled

15:36.144 --> 15:37.769
by U.S. immigration policy.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.105
It's complicated, but it's worth it.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.357
That's true.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.359
Yeah, so...

15:44.360 --> 15:48.321
is this happening or...

15:48.322 --> 15:50.115
I'm gonna go for it.
I'm gonna set a meeting

15:50.116 --> 15:51.700
with HR.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.118
We're gonna go on double dates!

15:53.119 --> 15:54.578
Yeah!
Aww!

15:54.579 --> 15:56.079
I can't believe you've
been coming here alone

15:56.080 --> 15:59.291
for the past two weeks.
I know. It sucks.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.001
I've been, like...

16:01.002 --> 16:03.587
talking to shoes and stuff.
The Louboutins?

16:03.588 --> 16:05.046
Duh.
Mm.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.178
And as you can see, the website's
just not that intuitive.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.637
We have to rebuild it
from the ground up.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.015
But the dot-com has a deeper issue.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.225
We need to figure out a way to appeal

16:17.226 --> 16:19.979
to a broader audience.
Well, actually, it's the opposite.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

16:29.989 --> 16:32.991
I just got back from
a couple weeks in Peru

16:32.992 --> 16:35.076
with my girlfriend,
and while I was traveling,

16:35.077 --> 16:37.245
I talked to all
different kinds of women.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.789
And I realized that, true or not,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.334
"Scarlet" is perceived as a magazine for

16:42.335 --> 16:44.169
straight middle-class women.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.712
And the magazine is not gonna change...

16:45.713 --> 16:47.964
I mean it... it shouldn't.
It works, but...

16:47.965 --> 16:50.175
the website can afford
to take more risks

16:50.176 --> 16:53.136
and push the envelope.
More than it already does?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.597
There are so many stories about...

16:55.598 --> 16:58.391
orgasms.
You are welcome, America.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.312
Continue, Kat.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.271
Okay.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.566
I'm gonna tweet out links
to two different stories,

17:06.567 --> 17:08.944
one about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

17:08.944 --> 17:11.404
and the other about this guy...

17:11.405 --> 17:12.864
Sparkle Pony,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.825
who self-identifies as a unicorn.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.913
Which one do you think is
gonna get more retweets?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.414
Okay, fine, I'll play.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.915
The royals.

17:25.086 --> 17:28.546
Nobody else?

17:28.547 --> 17:30.298
Okay.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.508
All right.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.261
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have...

17:34.262 --> 17:37.013
14 likes and 8 retweets.

17:37.014 --> 17:42.018
And Sparkle Pony has
45 likes and 23 retweets.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.647
24... 25.

17:45.648 --> 17:49.526
When it comes to the
Internet and millennials,

17:49.527 --> 17:51.236
it's not about the story.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.821
It's about the conversation it starts.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.365
That's how we reach
the trend-setters of today.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.578
34 retweets...

17:59.579 --> 18:02.163
35, 36...
All right, Kat.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.000
Thank you. You've given us
a lot to think about.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.085
Moving on...

18:07.920 --> 18:10.297
You should have seen the look
on the board members' faces

18:10.298 --> 18:11.673
when I was breaking it down for them.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.258
They were like, "What...
what is happening?"

18:15.094 --> 18:17.178
Sorry, old guys,
it's time to let someone else speak.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.306
Kat is back, and she's on "fi-yah!"

18:19.307 --> 18:20.199
Scorching.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.459
Everyone knows that Sutton
has been sleeping with him.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.144
It's the only reason she's getting all

18:24.145 --> 18:25.270
of these styling credits...
Uh,

18:25.271 --> 18:26.563
what the hell, Mitzi?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.817
Fashion closet... now.

18:37.039 --> 18:38.409
Is there something that
you would like to say

18:38.477 --> 18:40.183
to my face, Mitzi?
Yeah, I don't care

18:40.237 --> 18:42.454
what paperwork you sign. It's bullshit.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.122
You're getting preferential treatment

18:44.123 --> 18:45.915
just because of who
you're sleeping with.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.335
Sutton is not getting
preferential treatment.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.295
This is the second styling
credit he's given you.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.339
Did you honestly think
no one was gonna notice?

18:52.340 --> 18:53.882
Are you talking about Alex?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.342
We all know you're banging him.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.093
Oh, it was one time.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.970
And it is none of your business.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.222
It is when you're stealing jobs from us.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.807
I'm sorry, are you new here?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.976
I'm not stealing jobs from you.
I'm working my ass off.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.145
You're sleeping your way to the top.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.607
It's a story as tired as that outfit.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.234
Classy.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.237
All right, listen up, Mitzi.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.782
Sutton does not need
to sleep with anybody

19:18.783 --> 19:20.075
to be amazing at her job.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.369
And the outfit is fierce.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.871
Good night.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.456
Bye.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.085
Oh, my God. Everybody knows.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.087
And if they didn't before, they do now.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.380
No, Mitzi's an idiot.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.090
I heard she named her dog Charmin,

19:35.091 --> 19:36.800
like the toilet paper.
I have to talk to Alex.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.551
Oh, see, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.220
I don't know if he's the type
to talk about hookups...

19:40.221 --> 19:41.805
Kat.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.848
Oh, hey!

19:43.849 --> 19:45.975
Hi, Sutton.
Hey, Adena.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.270
I'm so sorry to be rude,
but I have to run.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.065
Is everything okay?
Uh, not really.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.650
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.694
Do you think she'd like
to join us for lunch?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.530
Oh, actually, I should have texted you.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.948
Is it okay if we rain-check?

19:59.949 --> 20:01.825
I just want to make sure Sutton's okay,

20:01.826 --> 20:03.535
and I have to follow up
on this wild board meeting

20:03.536 --> 20:05.036
I just went to.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.414
It's just...
it's been a crazy first day back.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.582
You know?
Okay, I understand.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.335
I'll see you later?
Okay. I can't wait.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.842
You're at work.
Oh, so what?

20:18.843 --> 20:21.094
Let them see. I'm a rebel.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.345
Bye!

20:22.346 --> 20:24.222
Thank you so much for your time.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.349
Um, I'm a writer for "Incite,"

20:26.350 --> 20:28.435
and I'm doing a story on Emma Cox.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.311
So I just wanted to get a quote from you

20:30.312 --> 20:34.399
about how the OTR free cup program
has impacted the women who stay here.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.360
Um, I'd say quite poorly.

20:37.832 --> 20:39.446
Three of our clients
wound up in the hospital

20:39.447 --> 20:41.281
with infections.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.451
I don't understand.
They're safer than tampons.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.453
Yeah, if they're washed and sterilized.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.830
But the women who come here
don't have regular access

20:48.831 --> 20:50.540
to sanitation.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.042
Look, the intentions were good,
but these cups were made

20:53.043 --> 20:54.627
with women of privilege in mind,

20:54.628 --> 20:58.047
not women who don't have
access to basic facilities.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.799
These cups are not only useless.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.134
They're dangerous.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.554
Have you communicated this to OTR?

21:04.555 --> 21:05.780
Yes.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.683
I've spoken to Emma Cox
personally more than once.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.478
She's well aware of the problem.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.104
Good luck.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.778
I never said a word.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.696
Then how do people know?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.115
I don't know.
We were so drunk that night.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.492
Anybody could have seen us.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.660
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

21:27.661 --> 21:29.245
No, it's not that.
It's just, Mitzi thinks

21:29.246 --> 21:30.705
that you're giving me
these styling credits

21:30.706 --> 21:32.916
because we slept together.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.542
Oh, come on. That's crazy.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.545
I know.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.006
But why did you choose me
for the styling jobs?

21:40.007 --> 21:41.800
Because you have the best eye.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.220
It's Rachel Antonoff.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.721
Oliver Grayson's office.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.473
Hey, Rachel.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.559
Yes, I sent over
the proposals for the layout.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.645
Me?

21:53.646 --> 21:56.356
Um, I really like the first one.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.024
I think that it goes really well

21:58.025 --> 22:01.110
with the themes for your
Royal Bitch collection.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.403
Amazing!

22:02.404 --> 22:04.531
And I did set up a car for you, okay?

22:04.532 --> 22:06.991
Cool, see you soon.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.702
Rachel Antonoff asking your opinion.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.497
Look who's fancy now.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.624
Look...

22:14.625 --> 22:16.877
maybe you should find somebody else
to style your shoots.

22:19.129 --> 22:23.550
I can't have people thinking
I'm getting preferential treatment.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.677
It just sucks.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.346
Look, don't let people get in your head.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.640
You're really good at your job.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.518
Thanks, Alex.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.354
But I'm not sure it's enough.

22:40.568 --> 22:44.362
Emma, why didn't you mention
the problem with the cups to me earlier?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.155
As soon as we realized
this was happening,

22:46.156 --> 22:48.116
we stopped the program,
and we're working

22:48.117 --> 22:51.494
on a prototype for a disposable cup
that doesn't need to be sterilized.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.746
You're not donating any cups right now,

22:53.747 --> 22:56.417
but your advertising still
promotes that program.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.420
Look, I'm in a tight spot here.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.463
If we lose customers,
then we can't afford

23:02.464 --> 23:05.592
to do the research and development
on the disposable cups.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.428
I want to expand to the schools too.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.905
Did you know many low-income girls
don't go to school

23:11.991 --> 23:14.183
because they can't afford
sanitary products?

23:14.184 --> 23:18.271
This a huge gender issue
that no one is talking about.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.689
Yeah, I know.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.067
But this is a huge safety issue
that you are covering up.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.486
Jane...

23:25.487 --> 23:28.239
you know what it's like.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.574
You take a big swing,

23:29.575 --> 23:31.451
and sometimes it pays off.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.785
Sometimes it falls apart.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.288
That's just the cost of taking risks.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.719
Hey, babe.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.429
Hello.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.932
Oh, my God, did you cook?
Yes, I did.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.767
Oh, it smells amazing!

23:55.768 --> 23:57.644
All day, I have been craving you

23:57.645 --> 23:59.312
and fesenjoon,

23:59.313 --> 24:03.983
and now I get to have both, hmm?

24:03.984 --> 24:05.568
So how about this...

24:05.569 --> 24:07.654
Me, you, fesenjoon,

24:07.655 --> 24:10.115
and a super fun "Scarlet" party?

24:11.575 --> 24:12.910
Hmm.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.872
I'd love to just stay at home
and be with you tonight.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.916
Yeah, I know.
I mean, I want to stay home too.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.876
But I have to go to this party, so...

24:21.877 --> 24:23.294
why don't you come with me?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.296
You know,
I'll introduce you to everyone,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.173
show you off.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.635
Yeah, okay.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.596
Yeah. That sounds nice.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.307
And fesenjoon is even
better the next day.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.517
Perfect.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.061
It's gonna be so much fun.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.939
You're sure I can't change your mind?

24:42.940 --> 24:44.649
Uh, no.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.859
I can't go to a "Scarlet"
party and face Jacqueline,

24:46.860 --> 24:49.278
especially when my vertical's
supposed to launch tomorrow

24:49.279 --> 24:50.613
and the only thing I've done tonight

24:50.614 --> 24:52.490
is stress-tweeze my eyebrows.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.617
Oh, honey.
We both know where this can go,

24:54.618 --> 24:56.661
so please hand over the tweezers.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.079
Thank you.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.622
Emma lied.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.083
Can't you just write that?
No.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.711
I don't want my first column
to essentially be an exposé.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.755
I want to lift women up,
not tear them down.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.717
I don't really want to go either.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.553
I have no idea what I'm
gonna say to Richard.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.516
Okay. Sit.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.398
Thank you.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.191
How did you know you were
making the right choice

25:27.192 --> 25:28.609
when you left "Scarlet"?

25:28.610 --> 25:30.695
I didn't.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.531
Quite frankly, right now, I feel like
I made a huge mistake.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.033
So this isn't a pep talk?

25:36.744 --> 25:38.703
I'm sorry, okay.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.455
Okay, I'm with you,
so just break it down for me.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.583
Let's say you did go
all in with Richard.

25:43.584 --> 25:45.585
I mean, what are you so scared of?

25:45.586 --> 25:49.422
That even if I become
insanely successful, like...

25:49.423 --> 25:52.258
the next Grace Coddington or something,

25:52.259 --> 25:54.844
people will say,
"Sutton Brady got to where she is

25:54.845 --> 25:56.637
because of who she slept with."

25:56.638 --> 25:59.307
And that's not something
that Richard has to worry about.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.725
No, that double standard is, like,

26:00.726 --> 26:03.311
one of the classic rock
hits of patriarchy.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.651
Well, I guess you just need
to make a decision.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.653
I mean, what are you
more willing to gamble with,

26:12.654 --> 26:15.198
your career or your love life?

26:18.660 --> 26:22.288
That was not really reassuring, was it?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.957
No, but it was honest, and I need that.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.421
Do you have something?
Yeah.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.548
I've been putting so
much pressure on myself

26:32.549 --> 26:34.592
to make this article perfect.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.344
But it doesn't have to be perfect.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.305
It just has to be honest.
About Emma?

26:39.306 --> 26:40.640
About me...

26:40.641 --> 26:42.767
and Emma.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.477
I went in with the best intentions,

26:44.478 --> 26:45.728
and it didn't work out.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.814
Same with her.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.816
But we have to keep pushing.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.109
We have to keep trying.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.236
That's what Jacqueline would say.

26:53.237 --> 26:58.074
And that's inspiring and relatable.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.911
You did make the right decision,

27:01.912 --> 27:04.747
going to "Incite."
Thanks.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.833
I hope so.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.881
I'm off.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.303
Ah, you know what?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.097
I'm coming with you.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.682
Seriously?
Yeah.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.475
What about your article?
Well, now I know

27:24.476 --> 27:26.435
what it's gonna be,
so I can face Jacqueline,

27:26.436 --> 27:28.187
and I can help you face Richard.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.897
Unless you don't...

27:29.898 --> 27:31.524
Oh, please, I have the perfect dress.

27:31.525 --> 27:34.610
Style me.

27:36.822 --> 27:37.905

Nope.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.141
Any sign of Richard?
Nope.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.475
Drinks?
Yep.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.898
Hello, you two!
Hey!

28:11.899 --> 28:13.316
Jacqueline, I have to thank you

28:13.317 --> 28:15.192
for your generosity
during our time in Peru.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.945
You made some of my
culinary dreams come true.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.739
Oh, well, I got to live vicariously

28:19.740 --> 28:21.991
through your trip.
Jacqueline.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.118
Are you ready?

28:24.119 --> 28:25.786
Kat, I would love you
to walk the carpet.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.830
The more our digital audience
can get to know you,

28:27.831 --> 28:29.790
the better.
Yeah, sure.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.043
Come on, let's do this.
I'd rather not.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.129
Um...

28:35.505 --> 28:37.548
Well, um, we'll be waiting for you

28:37.549 --> 28:39.635
when you're ready.
Okay.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.970
What's up? Why wouldn't you want

28:42.971 --> 28:44.764
to walk the carpet?
Kat, please.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.349
Just go have your photo taken.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.059
I don't want to do it.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.773
Go.
Okay.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.776
This is our new social media director.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.153
<i>♪ Make it super loud ♪</i>

28:59.154 --> 29:01.030

29:01.031 --> 29:03.825
<i>♪ Make it super loud
make it super loud ♪</i>

29:16.046 --> 29:17.129
Hey.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.591
So what was that about?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.510
Kissing me in front of your coworkers

29:22.511 --> 29:25.388
and all the selfies and...

29:25.389 --> 29:27.932
now a... a walk down
the red carpet together.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.350
It's too much.
No,

29:29.351 --> 29:31.018
I don't want to hide anything.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.561
And we don't have to.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.980
It's not about hiding.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.023
You're going too fast.
Okay,

29:36.024 --> 29:38.234
we just spent weeks traveling together,

29:38.235 --> 29:39.819
just the two of us, and now

29:39.820 --> 29:42.071
you are essentially
living in my apartment.

29:42.072 --> 29:46.283
I don't understand how
one public photo is going too fast.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.327
We are just in the...

29:48.328 --> 29:50.162
in the beginning stages of this, Kat.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.622
It's... it's delicate.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.040
We're still finding each other.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.252
Okay, I think
you're being a little precious.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.754
You are ready to... to show me off

29:58.755 --> 30:01.799
and introduce me to the
world as your girlfriend

30:01.800 --> 30:03.175
and... and...

30:03.176 --> 30:05.344
put photos of us all over social media,

30:05.345 --> 30:07.138
but then...

30:07.139 --> 30:09.557
Never mind.
But what?

30:09.558 --> 30:12.560
Just say it, Adena.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.021
You're not ready to go down on me.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.982
What?
You don't go down on me.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.692
Hi.
We're gonna go to the bar.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.902
No, no, no, stay, stay, stay.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.238
I'm sorry, this was not the right place

30:24.239 --> 30:26.115
or time.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.616
Yeah, you're probably right.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.453
Maybe we should talk
back at the apartment.

30:30.454 --> 30:34.165
I'll wait up for you.
Great.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.586
Well, that did not look good.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.755
It wasn't great.

30:40.756 --> 30:41.922
I have an idea.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.676
Come with me.
Okay.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.513
Hey, you look like a girl
who could use a bathroom break.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.640
What are you talking about?

30:51.641 --> 30:53.100
Are you trying to steal something?

30:53.101 --> 30:57.021
No, no, we just need a moment
with our girl. She just got into a fight

30:57.022 --> 30:59.857
with her girlfriend, and, uh,
I'm guessing it's the first one.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.442
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, um,

31:01.443 --> 31:04.612
we need to chat, and we don't really
do bathrooms; We do closets.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.030
Sure, I get it,

31:06.031 --> 31:07.740
and I do really need to pee.

31:07.741 --> 31:10.076
Just don't steal anything, okay?

31:10.077 --> 31:11.703
Okay!
Great.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.456
What if... I don't know how to do it?

31:15.457 --> 31:17.416
Or what if I do it and I don't like it?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.460
Or I do it and it's weird or...

31:19.461 --> 31:21.045
You know, then what?

31:21.046 --> 31:22.922
Am I really queer,
or has this whole relationship

31:22.923 --> 31:26.300
been a lie? And why would Adena want
to be with someone who doesn't know

31:26.301 --> 31:28.135
how to do something
that she clearly likes?

31:28.136 --> 31:29.595
Hey.
What?

31:29.596 --> 31:32.056
You two are crazy about each other.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.434
One sex act is not
gonna break you guys up.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.144
Just talk to her.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.146
You're new at this. That's okay.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.108
You don't have to get it
perfectly right every time.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.276
Been there.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.072
Okay, let's go.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.076
My women.
So tiny, yet so strong.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.496
All right, I gotta go find Adena.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.623
Or at least her vagina.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.167
You couldn't resist.
I could not.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.261
Hey, Rachel!
Hi.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.346
Uh, Sutton from Oliver's office.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.973
Sutton! Come here!

32:13.974 --> 32:15.141
Oh!

32:15.142 --> 32:17.101
Yay, such a warm hug!

32:17.102 --> 32:18.644
Hi!
Hi!

32:18.645 --> 32:20.521
I'm so happy to meet you.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.023
I just wanted to make sure
that you have everything you need.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.859
Thank you. And yes, everything.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.944
You have been beyond amazing this week.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.196
I cannot thank you enough.
Oh, good!

32:29.197 --> 32:32.199
Seriously, your instincts are awesome.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.243
My pleasure.
There she is!

32:34.244 --> 32:35.828
Oliver Grayson!

32:35.829 --> 32:38.247
Now, I have picked

32:38.248 --> 32:39.665
all the looks for the shoot next week.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.083
It's going to be incredible.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.502
Sutton sent me a mock-up.
I'm so excited.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.212
This girl is a gem.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.215
Seriously, she is so talented.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.217
If you're not careful,
I'm going to poach her.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.552
Um, back off.

32:51.553 --> 32:54.180
I know a good thing when I have it.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.514
You look like you could use a refresher.

32:55.515 --> 32:56.932
Oh, yes.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.267
Whatcha drinking?
Champagne.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.768
Well, Rachel, Red, let's hit the bar.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.188
If you'll excuse me.
So good to meet you.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.898
Wonderful meeting you.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.192
Okay, let's go.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.278
Scotch neat, please.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.198
Jacqueline? Hi.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.365
Jane!

33:13.366 --> 33:15.993
I-I love the Karlie cover.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.203
Oh, thank you.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.788
Well, we were so thrilled to get her.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.499
How goes the vertical?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.126
Well, actually, uh,

33:24.127 --> 33:27.129
it launches tomorrow.
Really?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.547
Yeah, it's...

33:28.548 --> 33:31.759
it's kinda scary but exciting, and...

33:31.760 --> 33:34.178
I'm really enjoying the challenge.

33:34.179 --> 33:39.183
Well, it sounds like moving to "Incite"
was the right decision. Congratulations!

33:39.184 --> 33:41.443
I look forward to reading your piece.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.437
Thanks.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.983
All right, time to hand-hold
some advertisers.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.318
It was lovely to see you, Jane.

33:49.319 --> 33:51.820
You too.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.454
Hi.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.916
Hi.
You look amazing.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.044
Uh...

34:15.637 --> 34:19.098
I know that it's hard to understand...

34:19.099 --> 34:22.060
but I can't sign the agreement.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.231
Richard, you're...

34:27.232 --> 34:28.649
a board member.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.568
You're 15 years older than me.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.320
I'm an assistant.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.656
I make in a year what
you take home in a week.

34:35.657 --> 34:38.158
You know what people will say.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.911
Which is why we have legal protection.

34:40.911 --> 34:44.248
A contract cannot protect a reputation.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.252
You're walking away from
someone who loves you,

34:48.253 --> 34:51.045
who wants to build something with you,

34:51.047 --> 34:55.676
because some assistant
is gossiping about you?

34:55.677 --> 34:57.928
It's a gamble.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.140
All of it.

35:01.141 --> 35:04.560
But I'm putting my money
down on my career

35:04.561 --> 35:08.188
and believing that love
will fall in place.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.317
I couldn't feel more opposite
than that right now.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.240
Don't you think that's a problem?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.834
I can't do this anymore, Sutton...

35:28.835 --> 35:31.337
the secret meetings, the texts.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.088
I know.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.715
Not because I don't want to see you

35:34.716 --> 35:36.467
or because I don't want to talk to you.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.593
It's...
I know.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.928
It hurts both of us.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.607
So we really have to do it this time.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.904
We really have to move on.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.838
Good-bye, Sutton.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.859
Hi.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.278
Hey.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.365
There's still some dinner,
if you're hungry.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.284
Oh, thanks.

36:46.705 --> 36:50.290
Uh... so...

36:50.291 --> 36:52.960
I kind of feel like I...

36:52.961 --> 36:54.670
screwed this whole thing up.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.422
No, no.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.341
Kat, don't say that. Um...

36:59.342 --> 37:01.468
it was not just you. I...

37:01.469 --> 37:02.720
I'm sorry I snapped.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.472
I could have been more honest.

37:05.473 --> 37:10.894
Look, it's on me
for not offering, but...

37:10.895 --> 37:15.691
I don't know... Why didn't you just ask?

37:15.692 --> 37:18.527
Do you remember
what you said to me the first night

37:18.528 --> 37:22.030
that we hung out?

37:22.031 --> 37:23.866
You couldn't ever...

37:23.867 --> 37:25.659
"do that."
Oh.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.370
Couldn't even say it.
Oh.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.497
Yeah, but I didn't know
what I was talking about.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.499
Kat, it's okay.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.085
We are still new to this. I...

37:35.086 --> 37:37.004
I didn't want to push
you to do something

37:37.005 --> 37:40.716
that you weren't ready to do or...

37:40.717 --> 37:42.801
didn't want to.
Oh!

37:42.802 --> 37:44.428
No, no, no, it is not that.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.514
I'm so attracted to you.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.309
But I guess I was a little, uh,

37:50.310 --> 37:52.019
worried...

37:52.020 --> 37:53.312
and scared.

37:53.313 --> 37:56.148
Well, of course. It's, um...

37:56.149 --> 37:57.441
It's cunnilingus.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.026
It's the last frontier.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.779
Where no man has gone before.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.282
You know, Kat, it's not even the act
that matters.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.869
It's you and me being able
to have these conversations.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.955
Talking about it is
the most intimate thing.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.499
And that's...

38:13.500 --> 38:15.667
that's what I should
have said at the party.

38:15.668 --> 38:19.630
This is what matters.
I know.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.048
But, my God,

38:21.049 --> 38:23.926
I've never talked about oral sex
so much in my entire life,

38:23.927 --> 38:25.761
and I work at "Scarlet."
