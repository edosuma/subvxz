00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.414
(needle scratches)

01:20.414 --> 01:23.178
(rock and roll blaring)

01:29.923 --> 01:31.914
(phone ringing)

01:33.827 --> 01:38.399
-Ruthie, Bethel is on the phone.
-(|oud rock music continues)

01:38.399 --> 01:41.101
What's that smell?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.504
You know, Little Nicky's
getting real good.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.339
Chip off the old wood.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.375
Honey, Bethel is on the phone
because today is the last day

01:48.375 --> 01:51.245
for the finalists to turn in
your favorite household hints,

01:51.245 --> 01:54.048
so that we can win the big prize
and be on TV.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.683
And the big prize

01:55.683 --> 01:58.485
is one of those
darling Amana freezers, Nicky.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.054
And I can't concentrate

02:00.054 --> 02:01.922
with Little Nicky banging away
on those...

02:01.922 --> 02:03.891
Honey, but he's getting
real good though, eh?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.793
Yeah.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.094
You know, I didn't see
my favorite shirt

02:07.094 --> 02:09.029
hanging up this morning.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.832
Because there it is.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
-Where did this stain come from?
-B|ood.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.670
I didn't blood on my shirt.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.872
Well, I did.
I bled all over it

02:18.872 --> 02:20.974
just so I could practice
getting out the stain.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.143
This is the third shirt
you've ruined

02:23.143 --> 02:26.246
with Ruthie's household "hins."

02:26.246 --> 02:28.215
-"Hints." Household "hints."
-What?

02:28.215 --> 02:29.717
0h, never mind.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.853
Bethel, here she is,
the household "mence."

02:32.853 --> 02:33.854
Mence?!

02:33.854 --> 02:35.522
You know,
like Dennis the "Mence."

02:35.522 --> 02:38.826
Oh. Hello? Bethel?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.462
l... I can't hear you.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.665
Nicky, please tell
Little Nicky to stop.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.201
Okay, okay,
I'll go tell him to stop.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.361
Thanks, honey.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.029
(over loud music): Little Nicky,
you have to stop now!

02:58.245 --> 02:59.872
(needle scratches,
music stops)

03:01.915 --> 03:03.951
Hi, Dad. I got it.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.286
Yeah, right in the pocket,
but you have to stop now

03:06.286 --> 03:07.921
'cause your mother
is on the phone.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.591
Dad, can I sit in for one song
with the band tonight?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.226
Oh, I don't know, Little Nicky.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.395
Aw, can I, Dad?
Gee, Dad, can I?

03:15.395 --> 03:17.231
You said I was sounding good.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.532
Like Buddy Rich almost.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.834
Well, I don't know,
Little Nicky.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.504
Well, okay, I'll talk to the
rest of the guys in the band.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.173
0h, gee, Dad, will you?
Really?

03:26.173 --> 03:27.441
-0h, wow!
-You know...

03:27.441 --> 03:29.576
l'll practice all day.
Listen to this.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.311
-(|oud drumming)
-Bethe|,

03:31.311 --> 03:34.081
everything has to rhyme...
Nicky.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.649
Honey, the kid has to practice.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.984
Listen to this, Dad.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.353
No, no, no, you have
to get behind the beat.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.487
Behind...

03:40.487 --> 03:41.622
(rhythmic cadence):
Behind the beat,

03:41.622 --> 03:42.856
behind the beat.
That's it.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.359
Behind the beat, behind
the beat, behind the beat.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.060
-That's it.
-I can't find anything. Yeah.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.329
Behind the beat, behind the
beat, behind the beat...

03:49.329 --> 03:51.665
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.500
Quiet!

03:53.500 --> 03:57.938
lam just asking
for one day of quiet.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.773
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, honey.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.608
But then you have to hurry up
and finish up

04:01.608 --> 04:03.143
with the household hints
business

04:03.143 --> 04:04.978
so that we can get back to life
like normal around here, huh?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.280
Okay, honey.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.581
Come on, Little Nicky,

04:07.581 --> 04:08.916
walk with me down to
the train station, huh?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.551
Wait till you see
how happy you are

04:10.551 --> 04:13.587
when l have that Amana freezer
in the house.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.456
We'll all sit in it
and cool off.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.891
And, Little Nicky,

04:17.891 --> 04:19.993
you come right back
from that train station.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.261
Yes, Mom.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.429
Okay.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.964
(knocking on door)

04:23.964 --> 04:26.934
(groans):
Oh...

04:26.934 --> 04:29.027
(sighs)

04:30.237 --> 04:32.372
Whatever it is,
we don't want it.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.374
You've got roy-monia.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.864
(wheezes, splutters)

04:37.211 --> 04:39.746
-'Monia. Need it.
-What?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.316
Trade... Need 'monia.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.685
Oh...

04:44.685 --> 04:47.176
-Mister...
-(splutters)

04:50.791 --> 04:52.359
(splutters, groans)

04:52.359 --> 04:53.694
Arter-bay.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.363
l have the arter-things
to bart-bay for ammonia.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.065
-You have ammonia, lady?
-Oh, yeah.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.967
Come on in and sit down.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.401
-Ammonia.
-|'ve got ammonia.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.270
-Ammonia. Need-need ammonia.
-Yeah, I got ammonia.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.706
I use ammonia to take out
carbon paper stains...

05:05.706 --> 05:07.074
Need ammonia.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.109
...blood, grease--
the ten percent strength,

05:09.109 --> 05:11.111
being careful of silk and wool,
of course.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.380
Ew, this isn't wool, is it?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.682
No wonder you're fainting.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.218
It must be a hundred degrees
out there.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.053
Foresby-breathe.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.056
leed... I need admonia.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.525
Mister, I got a little lipstick
on your suit.

05:25.525 --> 05:28.061
I bet you need a glass of water.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.898
O-nee, ne-watuper, no watuper.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.133
Hey, what are you selling?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.369
Do you have anything to get out
tobacco stains?

05:35.369 --> 05:36.937
All l have is ammonia.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.006
'Monia. 'Monia.

05:39.006 --> 05:43.677
But if you have something to get
it out quicker and easier,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.846
Have many, many things in here.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.715
Here, any many things
for ady-trade for ammonia.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.885
See? Here, have for opener, see?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.353
(electronic tones)

05:53.353 --> 05:54.588
See? Opening, opening, opening.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.790
Openings, openings.
(laughs)

05:56.790 --> 05:58.325
Everything opening, opening.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.527
Trade, lady, trade?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.396
You know,
you don't sound so good.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.697
And you look sick.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.899
Maybe you should go home
and rest for the day.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.367
Let me get
this lipstick stain out.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.002
Let's see...

06:09.002 --> 06:11.772
Dear Harried Housewife,

06:11.772 --> 06:13.840
Stubborn lipstick stain?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.943
Don't flip or kick.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.713
Rub the stain with white bread.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.149
Ah, brush away the crumbs--
J‘ Ta-da! J‘

06:22.149 --> 06:23.984
Lipstick gone.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.085
What a trick.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.119
Aw, aw...

06:26.119 --> 06:27.354
How's about

06:27.354 --> 06:29.990
a... a ozer-kozer
for ammonia, huh?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.059
See? Press, press.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.093
See, see?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.262
-Close. (laughs)
-Lipstick.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.663
(man groans)

06:36.663 --> 06:39.933
You know, if you really need
ammonia that bad,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.835
I'm going to give you some.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.270
'Monia? Have ammonia here?

06:43.270 --> 06:44.838
Oogy-googy, el-smell ammonia.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.673
'Monia smell oogy-good.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.976
I can smell 'monia
at hundred miles.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.244
-Well, here it is.
-(gasps)

06:51.244 --> 06:54.614
Oogy-oogy, googy-good.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.517
Ah. Yes!

06:57.517 --> 06:58.552
(chuckles)

06:58.552 --> 07:00.354
Oh, no, no, don't drink that.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.422
Oh, must drink, must.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.824
Mmm...

07:03.824 --> 07:05.892
Oh, good golly!

07:05.892 --> 07:08.295
Oh, the antidote
for swallowing ammonia

07:08.295 --> 07:11.365
is first you drink milk
and then fruit juice.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.367
Household hints, number ten:

07:13.367 --> 07:15.232
Drink this. Don't drink that.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.772
(steam whistle toots)

07:18.772 --> 07:20.674
Good golly.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.877
Oh, ervy-good.
Very, very oody-good-good.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.379
You have more, lady?

07:25.379 --> 07:26.713
Are you all right?

07:26.713 --> 07:28.648
My name Klaatzu.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.717
Not used to avity-gravity.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.686
Your name is Klaatzu?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.620
Name Klaatzu.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.824
You drank ammonia.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.960
I did. I sure did.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.695
I did, I drink ammonia.
I drink it.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.464
And l have rader-traders in here
for more.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.600
I need three-year supply.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.469
You're not from around here,
are you?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.605
Oh, I stay here for three years.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.509
And then,
H watch and then I go home

07:55.509 --> 07:57.844
and | tell about you.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.013
Rader-traders

08:00.013 --> 08:02.049
for more, lady?
More ammonia?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.884
Mom! Mom!
Dad said I could sit in

08:03.884 --> 08:06.086
tonight with the band,
so I got to practice, okay?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.288
-Oh, wait a minute, young man.
-Mom, I got to practice.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.623
Now we made a deal--

08:09.623 --> 08:11.658
| get the morning,
you get the afternoon.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.560
But what if I don't get it right
in the afternoon?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.095
I can't go back
to the morning to practice

08:15.095 --> 08:17.664
before the afternoon,
'cause the morning will be gone.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.100
But, honey, it's so hard
to work when you're playing.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.169
It's just a stupid
household "hin."

08:22.169 --> 08:23.937
Hints! Household hints.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.705
No one around here
speaks English.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.764
I'm gonna go practice now.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.285
I'm sorry, mister.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.619
Oh, it's kay-o, kay-o.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.221
I got to go practice now.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.722
Little Nicky...?

08:42.722 --> 08:46.193
And I must give you
something for ammonia.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.828
Oh, the only thing I need

08:47.828 --> 08:50.030
is to turn off Little Nicky
for a couple hours.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.498
Turn off Nicky?

08:51.498 --> 08:54.367
Just for a couple hours
so I can get my work done.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.869
Oh, yes, bio-stasis field.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.204
(Little Nicky playing drums,
rock 'n' roll blaring)

08:57.204 --> 08:59.339
We call it oper-stop.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.776
Yeah, sure. that's what I need--
an oper-stop.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.411
-Mm-hmm.
-Mister,

09:04.411 --> 09:06.746
if you've got something
that will turn kids off

09:06.746 --> 09:10.584
for a couple hours, you can have
all the ammonia in the house.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.920
Ah, here is oper-stop.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.150
Wow.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.323
(over loud music):
Hi, Mom!

09:24.397 --> 09:27.200
(electronic whirring,
music stops)

09:27.200 --> 09:30.761
Wow! It works.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.811
(music resumes)

09:37.811 --> 09:39.946
What do you think, Mom?
Gene Krupa, eh?

09:39.946 --> 09:43.250
Oh, it sounds great, honey.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.885
(electronic whirring,
music stops)

09:44.885 --> 09:46.753
Oh, wow, I could win

09:46.753 --> 09:49.556
the household hints contest
with this.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.319
Do you have any more of these?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.667
Nicky, I'm home.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.203
Ruthie? Ruthie?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.505
Hi, honey.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.374
Look, all done.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.642
Well, that's nice, honey,

10:08.642 --> 10:10.577
but I came home to pick up
Little Nicky.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.845
I thought he would be
practicing.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.946
Where is he?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.014
Here's your shirt.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.450
Hey, what do you know--
no blood.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.120
So these household "hins"
are good for something.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.254
Yeah.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.656
Little Nicky!

10:22.656 --> 10:26.059
Oh, honey, he's been such
a good little boy all day.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.195
Let him play two numbers
with the band tonight.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.719
Why is he so quiet?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.633
RUTHIE:
Surprise.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.203
What is wrong with him?

10:36.203 --> 10:38.238
Oh, he's just taking
a little break.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.706
He looks like a statue.

10:39.706 --> 10:44.666
Hey, Little Nicky, that's
a pretty good trick there.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.714
That's a very difficult trick.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.816
You see that? He don't blink.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.018
-Look, Nicky.
-What's that?

10:52.018 --> 10:53.920
Well, it's an oper-stop.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.622
It stops things.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.990
Like you freeze.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.759
And then you press this button
here, see?

10:59.759 --> 11:03.763
And it stops the stop and
everything goes back to normal.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.398

11:05.398 --> 11:08.134
-(e|ectrical crackling)
-Oh!

11:08.134 --> 11:10.796
Oh, no.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.541
Little Nicky?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.077
NICKY: Very funny!
What's going on here?!

11:17.077 --> 11:18.445
You know, I like jokes, Ruthie,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.513
but right now I don't feel
like liking jokes.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.716
Ooh, this can't be happening!

11:22.716 --> 11:24.651
Hey, Little Nicky,
no more fooling around now!

11:24.651 --> 11:26.987
We have to go to the club, kid.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.455
Little Nicky?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.623
What's wrong with him?

11:29.623 --> 11:30.690
Let me see that "thin."

11:30.690 --> 11:32.025
Oh...

11:32.025 --> 11:33.393
Who gave you this "thin"?

11:33.393 --> 11:36.463
Uh, Mr. Klaatzu.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.798
It's an oper-stop.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.233
Ave Maria... gcuantas veces Ie
he dicho a ella...?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.302
Klaatzu?
Who the carajo is he?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.537
Oh, a very funny salesman.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.572
Well, what was he doing here?!

11:45.572 --> 11:46.873
He needed ammonia.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.642
-Ammonia?!
-He drinks it.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.777
Ruthie, this is no time
forjokes.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.446
I traded him ammonia for that!

11:53.446 --> 11:55.115
But you "ooper-stoop"
our Little Nicky!

11:55.115 --> 11:57.584
How could you do such a "thin"?!

11:57.584 --> 11:58.952
Oper-stopped.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.988
Well... I had to get blood
out of your shirt

12:01.988 --> 12:03.823
and gum out
of Little Nicky's hair

12:03.823 --> 12:06.593
so that I could win
the freezer! (sobs)

12:06.593 --> 12:09.129
A y, chihuahua.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.966
Oh, Nicky,
what are we gonna do?!

12:12.966 --> 12:16.169
We are going to find
this Mr. Klaatzu character

12:16.169 --> 12:19.906
and we are going to make him
"unooper-stoop" our Little Nicky

12:19.906 --> 12:22.575
before I wring
Mr. Klaatzu's neck.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.203
Now where is he?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.682

12:44.297 --> 12:46.993

12:48.535 --> 12:50.737

-Did you fix it?

12:50.737 --> 12:52.372

music stops)

12:52.372 --> 12:56.035

13:07.754 --> 13:10.223
Oh! Oh, stop it, Nicky!

13:10.223 --> 13:13.593
Oh, I can't stand it anymore.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.995
Come and help me in the kitchen.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.957
(Nicky muttering)
Caramba...

13:21.067 --> 13:23.403
I bought all the ammonia
in the store.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.471
Why so much?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.539
Well, Klaatzu said
he can smell it

13:26.539 --> 13:27.874
from a hundred miles away.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.076
It's what brought him here
in the first place.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.778
I thought it might
bring him back.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.013
Honey, this is
what a flake must be.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.582
Flake?

13:35.582 --> 13:38.785
You know, one of those weird
"thins" that don't happen often.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.220
"Fluke."

13:40.220 --> 13:43.690
Yeah! Well, | just hope this
passing fluke is no flake,

13:43.690 --> 13:46.593

going to be a frozen statue
