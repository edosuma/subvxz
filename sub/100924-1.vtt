03:10.722 --> 03:11.990
Come on, guys.

03:13.892 --> 03:15.828
Where the hell are you?

03:37.348 --> 03:38.515
Screw it.

03:38.517 --> 03:40.585
Time waits for no man.

03:42.822 --> 03:43.890
Neither do I.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.148
Hello?

08:07.119 --> 08:08.720
Guys, is that you?

08:14.092 --> 08:15.458
Oh, my god!

08:15.460 --> 08:17.597
What the hell was that?

08:19.498 --> 08:20.967
Okay, that's it.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.682
What the hell?

09:33.504 --> 09:34.439
Yeah, what?

09:35.606 --> 09:36.673
No, you...

09:36.675 --> 09:40.075
Sorry, you just scared
me for a second.

09:40.077 --> 09:41.178
No, nothing.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.312
Don't worry about it.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.146
Look, where are you guys?

09:44.148 --> 09:45.815
I thought we were meeting
all at the parking lot

09:45.817 --> 09:47.152
in the forest.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.152
You're headed there already?

09:50.154 --> 09:51.054
Fine.

09:51.056 --> 09:53.723
How do I get to there
from the beach?

09:53.725 --> 09:55.061
On foot, okay.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.526
Follow the red arrows.

09:57.528 --> 09:58.996
Yeah, okay, I got it.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.863
All right, I'll meet you there,
okay?

10:00.865 --> 10:03.065
All right, bye.

10:38.803 --> 10:40.035
Here we are.

10:40.037 --> 10:42.237
Leave it to Donna to get
the directions backwards.

10:42.239 --> 10:43.338
It happens.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.339
Where's the pool?

10:44.341 --> 10:45.040
Out back.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.443
I have to find the key first.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.376
Where is it?

10:47.378 --> 10:48.410
Uh, I can't remember.

10:48.412 --> 10:50.045
It's doorframe or mat.

10:50.047 --> 10:51.247
I'll check the doorframe.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.315
Come on, guys.

10:52.317 --> 10:53.049
Whose house is this?

10:53.051 --> 10:54.117
A friend of mine's parents.

10:54.119 --> 10:54.983
They hired a caretaker
to look after it

10:54.985 --> 10:56.587
while they're away in Aruba,

10:56.589 --> 10:58.387
but I guess they got held up
at the airport or something

10:58.389 --> 11:01.091
and my parents told them
I'd watch the place.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.825
I told them only if I
could bring my friends.

11:03.827 --> 11:05.027
They just said no boys.

11:05.029 --> 11:06.128
Sorry, Donna.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.897
Hey, more fun for us.

11:07.899 --> 11:10.000
Aha, bingo!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.834
Caretaker must've left already.

11:11.836 --> 11:13.904
So, no creepy old man
to spoil our fun then.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.070
Nope.

11:15.072 --> 11:15.737
Awesome.

11:15.739 --> 11:16.772
To the pool.

11:16.774 --> 11:18.007
Patience is not her strong suit.

11:18.009 --> 11:20.010
Yeah, we're
getting that.

11:20.012 --> 11:20.880
Hey!

11:21.614 --> 11:22.913
It's about time!

11:22.915 --> 11:24.714
Those were the worst
directions ever.

11:24.716 --> 11:25.518
Oh, whatever.

11:26.984 --> 11:31.454
Guys, this is my friend Jill,
my old roomie from college.

11:31.456 --> 11:32.322
Hi.

11:32.324 --> 11:32.988
I'm Jen.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.091
This is Donna and Tiffany.

11:34.093 --> 11:34.757
Hi.

11:34.759 --> 11:35.625
You can call me Tiff.

11:35.627 --> 11:36.559
Hey.

11:36.561 --> 11:37.727
Kim, thanks for inviting me.

11:37.729 --> 11:39.161
Oh, my pleasure.

11:39.163 --> 11:41.966
Let's go on in then, shall we?

11:49.675 --> 11:51.143
Okay, this is nice.

11:52.042 --> 11:53.109
You've never
been here before?

11:53.111 --> 11:54.743
No, this is my first time.

11:54.745 --> 11:55.612
Nice.

11:55.614 --> 11:56.380
This is sweet.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.447
Oh, I see the pool.

11:57.449 --> 12:00.117
Let's go get the rest
of the stuff from the car.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.351
Well, I mean, I've got
all my stuff here already.

12:02.353 --> 12:04.588
If you guys wanna go
get everything set up,

12:04.590 --> 12:05.354
I can make us some drinks.

12:05.356 --> 12:06.556
Yay!
Uh, sure.

12:06.558 --> 12:09.693
There should be a bar
around here somewhere.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.727
Oh no, I feel like
something's got me!

12:11.729 --> 12:13.463
It's dragging me
towards the pool!

12:13.465 --> 12:15.498
The horror, the horror!

12:15.500 --> 12:18.267
She said she wanted to get
wet as soon as she got here.

12:18.269 --> 12:20.636
What?

12:20.638 --> 12:21.507
Go.

12:22.807 --> 12:23.872
We'll get the rest of the bags.

12:23.874 --> 12:25.607
You just make sure she
doesn't drown.

12:25.609 --> 12:26.910
We will?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.180
Tiff.

13:03.248 --> 13:05.950
Hey, do you need some help?

13:07.319 --> 13:08.187
Okay.

13:12.391 --> 13:13.522
Those two are crazy.

13:13.524 --> 13:15.657
Yeah, that's one word for it.

13:15.659 --> 13:17.026
Tell me about this Jill.

13:17.028 --> 13:19.996
Well, as I said, she's
an old friend from school.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.497
Why'd you invite her along?

13:21.499 --> 13:22.899
Well, she went through
some rough times.

13:22.901 --> 13:24.568
I thought this might
cheer her up.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.501
What happened?

13:25.503 --> 13:26.169
Nothing happened.

13:26.171 --> 13:28.440
She's just an old friend.

13:29.707 --> 13:31.607
You know I can hear you guys,
right?

13:31.609 --> 13:32.478
Sorry.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.044
I was just curious.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.678
It's all right.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.814
I wanted to know who Kim's
other friends were for a while.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.684
I'm glad to finally
meet you guys.

13:40.686 --> 13:41.617
Wine coolers?

13:41.619 --> 13:43.587
Uh, later, thanks.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.820
I'll have a wine cooler.
Yeah.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.295
Yes!

13:53.297 --> 13:53.997
Woo!

13:53.999 --> 13:55.631
Wait, here.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.074
Don't even try.

14:07.979 --> 14:08.844
Okay, I'm going.

14:08.846 --> 14:10.581
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.

14:12.216 --> 14:13.882
It's a lot more difficult
than it looks.

14:13.884 --> 14:15.352
There it is.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.520
Totally relaxing.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.989
I'm loving this.

14:23.795 --> 14:24.993
No, no!

14:24.995 --> 14:29.000
Don't get my hair wet,
don't get my hair wet.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.567
Marco.

14:30.569 --> 14:31.434
Polo.

14:31.436 --> 14:32.304
Ah.

14:36.106 --> 14:37.806
Donna, get over here.

14:47.652 --> 14:48.520
Marco!

14:50.754 --> 14:52.021
Hey, where's Tiffany?

14:52.023 --> 14:53.622
Good grief.

14:53.624 --> 14:55.891
Let the kids be, Jen.

14:55.893 --> 14:57.694
You coming in?

14:57.696 --> 14:58.795
Maybe later.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.664
Water's nice.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.530
I'm sure.

15:01.532 --> 15:02.899
Come on.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.199
In a little bit.

15:04.201 --> 15:05.968
Does anybody want
anything else to drink?

15:05.970 --> 15:06.836
I do.

15:06.838 --> 15:07.770
You've had enough.

15:07.772 --> 15:09.170
You're not my real mom.

15:09.172 --> 15:10.674
I will, if you're going.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.540
All right.

15:11.542 --> 15:12.208
Donna?

15:12.210 --> 15:13.642
No thanks, I'm good.

15:13.644 --> 15:14.513
Okay.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.692
What's up?

15:29.694 --> 15:31.828
Enough swimming for one day.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.762
Anyone hungry?

15:33.764 --> 15:35.265
Munchies again?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.632
Why, whatever do you mean?

15:36.634 --> 15:39.636
There's a
barbecue over there.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.703
I'll get it lit.

15:40.705 --> 15:42.171
I'm sure you will.

15:42.173 --> 15:43.072
We've got the usual.

15:43.074 --> 15:44.607
Hamburgers, hot dogs.

15:44.609 --> 15:46.709
Sounds good, but if you
guys don't mind,

15:46.711 --> 15:49.011
I think I'm gonna lay
down for a little while.

15:49.013 --> 15:50.512
I'm a lot more tired than
I thought I was.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.714
That's okay.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.549
Yeah, we'll let you know
when the food's ready.

15:53.551 --> 15:54.420
Thanks.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.857
What was that?

16:00.859 --> 16:02.058
I don't know.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.727
I guess she's just tired
from all the walking.

16:04.729 --> 16:05.597
I guess.

16:07.398 --> 16:09.165
Come on, help me get
those burgers

16:09.167 --> 16:11.400
and hot dogs out of the freezer.

16:11.402 --> 16:12.236
Fine.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.713
Guys, burgers are ready!

18:36.113 --> 18:36.981
Hello?

18:38.616 --> 18:39.484
Hello?

18:40.984 --> 18:42.550
Mm, that was incredible.

18:42.552 --> 18:44.119
I could not eat another bite.

18:44.121 --> 18:45.288
Are all the hot dogs gone?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.588
Done and gone.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.956
That was incredible, Donna.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.692
You are a master at the grill.

18:49.694 --> 18:51.027
Hail to the chef.

18:51.029 --> 18:51.894
Hail, hail.

18:51.896 --> 18:52.761
Cheers.

18:52.763 --> 18:53.764
Thank you.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.033
How are you feeling?

18:58.035 --> 18:59.269
A lot better now.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.136
I think I just needed
to get some food in me.

19:01.138 --> 19:03.338
Well, that's good.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.974
So, what do we do for
fun around here, Kim?

19:05.976 --> 19:08.444
Any cards or board games?

19:08.446 --> 19:10.346
There should be some.

19:10.348 --> 19:11.748
Well, what's on deck
for this evening?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.416
That's what we're
trying to decide.

19:14.418 --> 19:15.717
I have an idea.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.953
What's that?

19:17.955 --> 19:18.821
It's in my bag.

19:18.823 --> 19:20.190
I'll be right back.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.758
Very mysterious.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.791
TicTacToe.

19:22.793 --> 19:23.792
Barrel of Monkeys.

19:23.794 --> 19:24.460
Twister.

19:24.462 --> 19:26.398
Now we're talking.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.604
Is that a, a...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.740
A hohal board?

19:41.378 --> 19:43.581
It's pronounced Ouija.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.652
I know, I saw the movie.

19:49.052 --> 19:50.519
Um...

19:50.521 --> 19:53.321
Well, I wasn't expecting this.

19:53.323 --> 19:55.593
Yeah, that's different.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.159
Why?

19:58.161 --> 19:59.462
What?

19:59.464 --> 20:01.800
I found it on the beach.

20:02.766 --> 20:03.634
Cool.

20:04.702 --> 20:05.967
Come on.

20:05.969 --> 20:10.041
We have to sit in a circle
for all of it to work.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.376
Come on, guys.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.782
We have to sit in a circle.

20:18.349 --> 20:19.382
I don't know.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.649
You don't know what?

20:20.651 --> 20:22.952
Isn't it to
summon ghosts or something?

20:22.954 --> 20:24.923
Yeah, isn't that cool?

20:26.224 --> 20:27.723
Come on, it's just a game.

20:27.725 --> 20:28.793
It'll be fun.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.794
I don't like
being scared.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.597
Okay, what do we do,
hold hands or something?

20:34.599 --> 20:35.463
Yeah, hold hands.

20:35.465 --> 20:36.633
Uh, that's not my hand.

20:39.437 --> 20:40.536
Come on, guys.

20:40.538 --> 20:42.172
We have to be serious
for this to work.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.172
Okay.
Seriously?

20:43.174 --> 20:44.475
Jen, please.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.844
Okay, what do we do?

20:47.846 --> 20:50.546
All right, this is
the planchette.

20:50.548 --> 20:51.681
We place it on the board

20:51.683 --> 20:53.915
and we each touch it with
our fingertips.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.217
Then, we ask a question.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.319
And if the spirits are in
a generous mood,

20:57.321 --> 20:59.454
they'll spell out their
answer on the board.

20:59.456 --> 21:02.125
At least according to the rule,
anyway.

21:02.127 --> 21:02.759
That's it?

21:02.761 --> 21:03.658
That's it.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.595
Yeah, that's what I saw
in the movie.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.532
Plus, bloody murder.

21:08.232 --> 21:10.099
What?

21:10.568 --> 21:13.269
All right, we'll keep
it simple at first.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.070
Does anybody have a
question they're dying

21:15.072 --> 21:16.539
to know the answer to?

21:16.541 --> 21:17.673
I might have one.

21:17.675 --> 21:18.340
Um...

21:18.342 --> 21:19.808
Okay, what do I need to do?

21:19.810 --> 21:20.809
Just ask.

21:20.811 --> 21:21.679
Okay.

21:24.048 --> 21:26.816
Oh, spirit of the Ouija board.

21:26.818 --> 21:31.753
Please, please, please tell
me, who wrote the book of love?

21:31.755 --> 21:32.722
Jen.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.589
Okay, sorry.

21:33.591 --> 21:34.857
Ooh.

21:34.859 --> 21:36.259
It's moving.

21:36.261 --> 21:39.028
Keep your fingers on it.

21:41.331 --> 21:42.466
No?

21:45.802 --> 21:50.205
I don't think it wants to
answer your stupid question.

21:50.207 --> 21:51.840
Right, that was so cool.

21:52.877 --> 21:53.878
All right.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.646
All right, let's try
another one.

21:57.648 --> 21:58.981
Okay.

21:58.983 --> 22:00.449
I have one.

22:00.451 --> 22:02.521
Are you a good spirit?

22:08.225 --> 22:09.290
Uhoh.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.627
That's a no.

22:12.629 --> 22:14.430
I don't like this.

22:14.432 --> 22:16.799
Come on, anyone else?

22:16.801 --> 22:18.067
Ooh, I have another one.

22:18.069 --> 22:19.201
Nothing stupid.

22:19.203 --> 22:20.071
Okay.

22:21.439 --> 22:25.576
Oh, spirit of the Ouija
board, how did you die?

22:31.215 --> 22:34.218
HUNGRY.

22:40.256 --> 22:41.790
Hungry?

22:41.792 --> 22:42.523
Weird.

22:42.525 --> 22:44.260
I don't like this.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.194
It's just a game.

22:45.196 --> 22:46.328
Yeah, don't worry.

22:46.330 --> 22:48.831
One of the girls is
spelling that stuff.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.067
If you say so.

22:51.802 --> 22:52.870
Yeah, uh...

22:54.539 --> 22:55.938
Where are you

22:55.940 --> 22:57.674
Do the thing.

22:57.676 --> 23:01.344
Oh, spirit of the Ouija board,
whatever.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.013
Where are you from?

23:04.814 --> 23:07.686
HUNGRY.

23:15.126 --> 23:16.390
Hungry?

23:16.392 --> 23:21.496
Looks like this board has
a onetrack mind.

23:21.498 --> 23:22.566
Whoa.

23:23.868 --> 23:25.136
DIE.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.507
Okay, I don't wanna do
this anymore.

23:31.509 --> 23:32.541
Maybe we should stop.

23:32.543 --> 23:35.546
Keep your fingers on it.

23:36.747 --> 23:37.615
Okay.

23:39.149 --> 23:40.014
Wait, something's happening.

23:40.016 --> 23:41.216
Yeah.

23:41.218 --> 23:42.551
Okay, everybody
keep your fingers on it.

23:42.553 --> 23:44.887
Everybody, close your
eyes and concentrate.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.199
That wasn't weird.

23:57.201 --> 23:59.268
Maybe we should stop.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.502
Come on, let's keep going.

24:00.504 --> 24:02.706
Keep your fingers on it.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.942
I don't know, I
don't like this.

24:06.944 --> 24:09.011
Who will be the first to die?

24:09.013 --> 24:10.178
Jill.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.213
Stop it, Jill.

24:11.215 --> 24:14.218
Come on, we have to
let it finish.

24:16.119 --> 24:17.019
Okay, fuck this.

24:17.021 --> 24:17.888
Yeah.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.723
Nothing's happening anyway.

24:20.725 --> 24:21.991
The spirit must've left.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.325
I think so.

24:23.327 --> 24:26.029
Well then, what was that?

24:26.031 --> 24:27.596
I don't know.

24:27.598 --> 24:29.263
Maybe it was a ghost.

24:29.265 --> 24:30.566
No way.

24:30.568 --> 24:32.568
A nonbeliever, huh?

24:32.570 --> 24:34.369
Look, it's a stupid game,
I'm bored.

24:34.371 --> 24:36.071
What do you guys wanna do next?

24:36.073 --> 24:38.706
I don't know, but I
don't like this.

24:38.708 --> 24:41.645
Yeah, I'm out of here.

25:35.032 --> 25:35.899
Hello?

25:36.567 --> 25:38.299
Daddy, it's me.

25:38.301 --> 25:40.269
Did I wake you?

25:40.271 --> 25:41.435
No, sweetheart.

25:41.437 --> 25:43.371
I'm working late tonight.

25:43.373 --> 25:45.042
Is something wrong?

25:46.343 --> 25:48.610
I don't know, maybe.

25:48.612 --> 25:51.046
I just had a terrible dream.

25:51.048 --> 25:54.716
Dreams can be a doorway
to the unconscious mind.

25:54.718 --> 25:57.453
I've told you that before.

25:57.455 --> 25:58.990
Tell me about it.

25:59.823 --> 26:02.023
I guess I should back up a bit.

26:02.025 --> 26:02.758
I...

26:02.760 --> 26:04.925
I was at the beach and I found

26:04.927 --> 26:07.496
this Ouija board in the water.

26:07.498 --> 26:12.467
Haven't I told you not to
fool around with those things?

26:12.469 --> 26:14.436
It's just a game, Dad.

26:14.438 --> 26:16.774
At least I thought it was.

26:18.442 --> 26:19.310
Go on.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.978
Well, we were playing for a bit

26:22.980 --> 26:27.115
and then the board started
shaking like crazy.

26:27.117 --> 26:28.517
Really?

26:28.519 --> 26:30.819
I've never heard of
such a thing.

26:30.821 --> 26:33.387
Dad, you have to believe me.

26:33.389 --> 26:34.824
Oh, I believe you.

26:34.826 --> 26:38.659
I'm just not familiar with
that type of manifestation.

26:38.661 --> 26:41.265
I'll need to do some research.

26:42.532 --> 26:45.270
In my dream there was a shark.

26:46.603 --> 26:49.370
I don't know if it's
connected or not.

26:49.372 --> 26:50.705
I'll look into it.

26:50.707 --> 26:54.309
If I come up with anything,
I'll let you know.

26:54.311 --> 26:55.045
Okay.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.982
And no more fooling
around with the occult.

26:59.984 --> 27:00.782
I know.

27:00.784 --> 27:02.451
Thanks, Dad.

27:02.453 --> 27:03.321
Bye.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.115
What about here?

28:07.117 --> 28:10.152
Sure, this seems as good
a spot as any.

28:10.154 --> 28:10.819
Okay.

28:10.821 --> 28:13.023
I'll just get the stuff.

28:30.942 --> 28:33.242
Uh, are you sure you
want to eat now?

28:33.244 --> 28:35.344
Wouldn't you rather eat
after we swim?

28:35.346 --> 28:36.712
I skipped breakfast.

28:36.714 --> 28:37.913
It's no big deal.

28:37.915 --> 28:41.186
Besides, I'd like to
catch some rays.

28:43.719 --> 28:44.653
Oh, yeah.

28:44.655 --> 28:47.325
Uh, you should totally do that.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.027
I mean, we can do
whatever you like.

28:52.029 --> 28:53.762
What was that thing
that parents said

28:53.764 --> 28:56.098
about swimming and eating?

28:56.100 --> 28:58.134
Something like you
shouldn't swim

28:58.136 --> 28:59.969
right after you eat,
or whatever.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.936
Something about getting cramps.

29:01.938 --> 29:04.606
Yeah, I think that was it.

29:04.608 --> 29:07.242
I think that's been debunked.

29:07.244 --> 29:08.444
But is it true?

29:08.446 --> 29:12.917
I think you should look
up what debunked means.

29:29.532 --> 29:30.799
Crackers.

29:30.801 --> 29:31.966
What?

29:31.968 --> 29:35.303
Uh, do you want some crackers?

29:35.305 --> 29:36.173
Sure.

29:40.811 --> 29:42.877
Uh, you got some...

29:42.879 --> 29:45.483
Uh, it happened to me as well.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.049
Pardon?

29:48.051 --> 29:51.955
Uh, so, Cass, I wanted
to ask you something.

29:52.889 --> 29:54.388
Normally, all of your
friends are around

29:54.390 --> 29:57.659
and I never really get the
chance to ask you anything
alone.

29:57.661 --> 30:00.328
Uh, so I thought I'd
ask you now.

30:00.330 --> 30:01.230
Ask me something?

30:01.232 --> 30:02.100
Like what?

30:03.167 --> 30:07.069
Well, you know, we went
to prom together, right?

30:07.071 --> 30:09.471
I know, I was there.

30:09.473 --> 30:12.174
Well, I don't know how
you felt about things,

30:12.176 --> 30:15.944
you know, since we've known
each other for such a long time.

30:15.946 --> 30:19.146
What are you so nervous about?

30:19.148 --> 30:21.081
Well, you know how it is.

30:21.083 --> 30:22.984
Not at this particular moment.

30:22.986 --> 30:24.621
No, I have no idea.

30:25.889 --> 30:28.458
Well, I wanted to ask you...

30:31.529 --> 30:32.993
What the hell is that?

30:32.995 --> 30:35.731
You wanted to ask me
what the hell is that?

30:35.733 --> 30:37.601
What the hell is what?

30:44.742 --> 30:45.808
Oh, my god.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.742
Is that a shark?

30:47.744 --> 30:49.013
Or a ghost?

31:14.405 --> 31:15.236
Oh, thank God.

31:15.238 --> 31:17.641
It's going after him first.

31:56.647 --> 31:59.115
Okay, sharkghost thingy.

31:59.117 --> 32:01.049
You already ate.

32:01.051 --> 32:02.786
Please, go away now.

33:19.463 --> 33:20.330
Woo.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.166
Hey.

33:23.065 --> 33:25.599
Hey, that's right, I'm alone.

33:30.706 --> 33:35.112
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

33:40.216 --> 33:42.450
Maybe it wants a hit.

33:42.452 --> 33:45.419
Here, sharky, sharky, sharky!

33:45.421 --> 33:46.922
This is some good shit!

33:48.658 --> 33:49.526
Whoa.

33:50.394 --> 33:52.396
Personal space, dude.

33:53.696 --> 33:55.196
Wanna hit?

33:56.399 --> 34:00.204
That is so cool.

34:03.307 --> 34:07.712
Are you like some sort of
air balloon or something?

34:10.913 --> 34:13.315
I suspect you're a figment.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.455
Do you think you are a figment?

34:37.206 --> 34:38.542
Oh, my head.

34:45.014 --> 34:46.748
Donna still sleeping?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.183
She went out for a run.

34:48.185 --> 34:49.253
Really?

34:50.052 --> 34:51.552
A run.

34:51.554 --> 34:52.422
Oh, run.

35:01.531 --> 35:04.299
Please, tell me
there's more coffee.

35:04.301 --> 35:05.636
The kitchen.

35:10.773 --> 35:13.608
Hey, have you guys seen
my Ouija board?

35:13.610 --> 35:14.275
I don't know.

35:14.277 --> 35:15.777
It should be over there.

35:15.779 --> 35:17.715
Well, it's not there.

35:19.782 --> 35:23.384
Well, that's where
we left it last night.

35:23.386 --> 35:25.255
Somebody move it?

35:26.156 --> 35:27.889
No.
No.

35:27.891 --> 35:29.858
Well, I want it back.

35:29.860 --> 35:33.328
Well, maybe Donna moved it
when she went for her run.

35:33.330 --> 35:34.862
Well, it's not there now.

35:34.864 --> 35:37.898
I don't know where it is.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.534
Did one of you guys take it?

35:39.536 --> 35:40.768
We didn't touch the
stupid thing.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.036
It's not stupid.

35:42.038 --> 35:44.239
Okay, it's probably
around here somewhere, okay?

35:44.241 --> 35:46.775
We'll ask Donna when
she gets back.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.175
For now, we'll
probably feel better

35:48.177 --> 35:50.647
once we have some breakfast.

35:51.348 --> 35:52.179
She's right.

35:52.181 --> 35:53.081
Sorry, Jill.

35:53.083 --> 35:54.750
It's fine.
I didn't mean it.

35:54.752 --> 35:57.886
Uh, there's pancake mix
in the pantry

35:57.888 --> 36:02.824
and there should be some bacon
and sausages in the freezer.

36:02.826 --> 36:03.925
The freezer's empty.

36:03.927 --> 36:06.695
And that pancake mix is
like a million years old.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.862
I already checked.

36:07.864 --> 36:09.563
So, no brekkie?

36:09.565 --> 36:11.166
Well, there's coffee, and milk,

36:11.168 --> 36:13.268
and what we ate last night.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.538
No brekkie.

36:18.275 --> 36:20.411
Well, that won't stand.

36:21.210 --> 36:23.078
There was a store
some miles back.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.181
I'll go get some groceries
and bring back some breakfast.

36:26.183 --> 36:27.882
Any food allergies I
should be aware of?

36:27.884 --> 36:28.317
I'll go.

36:28.319 --> 36:29.483
It's my fault.

36:29.485 --> 36:30.953
I should've made sure
we were wellstocked.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.753
I can go, it's fine.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.855
We'll make sure the
table's at least clear

36:34.857 --> 36:35.523
when you get back.

36:35.525 --> 36:37.092
Damn right you will.

36:37.094 --> 36:38.527
I'll be back soon.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.397
Bye.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.695
Here's something.

37:14.697 --> 37:18.933
As a spirit animal, a shark
may take on many meanings,

37:18.935 --> 37:23.540
representing the most primal
and ancient instincts.

37:29.980 --> 37:33.648
One choosing such an
animal as their totem

37:33.650 --> 37:37.886
must also be prepared for
the spirit's unpredictability

37:37.888 --> 37:39.824
and its desire to hunt.

37:41.725 --> 37:44.828
Why would anyone want to
summon a shark?

37:46.330 --> 37:51.366
Sharks are masters of survival
and their power is unmatched.

37:51.368 --> 37:54.904
Manifesting such a spirit
is illadvised.

38:07.851 --> 38:09.550
Three card spread.

38:09.552 --> 38:11.888
Past, present, and future.

38:19.362 --> 38:21.098
Le Monde, the world.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.835
For me, that's Jill.

38:28.938 --> 38:30.741
Le Diable, the Devil.

38:33.109 --> 38:35.045
That must be the shark.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.016
La Mort, death.

38:44.888 --> 38:45.755
Oh, no.

39:50.453 --> 39:53.590
What the hell is
that doing here?

40:01.031 --> 40:01.898
Hell no.

40:13.409 --> 40:15.309
Excuse me, Officer.

40:15.311 --> 40:16.344
Yes, ma'am?

40:16.346 --> 40:17.579
How may I be of service?

40:17.581 --> 40:19.246
It's my daughter Cassie.

40:19.248 --> 40:20.315
She went out with a friend

40:20.317 --> 40:22.650
and we haven't heard
from her all day.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.284
Oh, that's terrible.

40:24.286 --> 40:25.920
I'll make some notes.

40:25.922 --> 40:27.788
How old is your daughter, ma'am?

40:27.790 --> 40:29.157
She's 18.

40:29.159 --> 40:30.791
She went out with a boy.

40:30.793 --> 40:33.295
Supposedly, they went
to Sarsaparilla Trail

40:33.297 --> 40:34.795
for a picnic or something.

40:34.797 --> 40:38.199
Well, you know how kids are.

40:38.201 --> 40:40.601
What's that supposed to mean?

40:40.603 --> 40:43.572
Well, if they got
caught up in fun,

40:43.574 --> 40:46.507
they might've lost
track of time.

40:46.509 --> 40:47.474
Have you tied phoning her?

40:47.476 --> 40:48.942
Yes, of course.

40:48.944 --> 40:51.679
She's always using her phone.

40:51.681 --> 40:53.915
It's unusual for her
to not answer.

40:53.917 --> 40:56.284
But I haven't been able
to reach her.

40:56.286 --> 40:57.686
Okay.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.320
I'll get you to go down
to the station

40:59.322 --> 41:00.855
and fill out some paperwork.

41:00.857 --> 41:03.491
Um, how long has she
been missing?

41:03.493 --> 41:04.960
A few hours.

41:04.962 --> 41:05.927
Oh.

41:05.929 --> 41:08.795
Well, technically, she's
not a missing person

41:08.797 --> 41:11.866
until she's been gone for 24.

41:11.868 --> 41:14.835
So, you can't do anything?

41:14.837 --> 41:16.570
I'll tell you what I'll do.

41:16.572 --> 41:20.574
I'll get you to do that
paperwork
and I'll give you my card.

41:20.576 --> 41:22.844
If you hear anything, you
keep me informed

41:22.846 --> 41:24.813
and we'll do the same.

41:24.815 --> 41:25.547
Okay.

41:25.549 --> 41:27.016
Thanks, Officer.

41:34.891 --> 41:35.623
Hey, Jed.

41:35.625 --> 41:37.525
Where are you?

41:37.527 --> 41:39.663
I'm in the middle of a case.

41:40.830 --> 41:43.264
It had better be a police
case and not a case of beer.

41:43.266 --> 41:47.235
I need you to get down
to Sarsaparilla Trail.

41:47.237 --> 41:48.372
Aw, come on.

41:49.239 --> 41:50.572
I'm doing something.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.741
What's so important?

41:52.743 --> 41:54.141
Missing teens.

41:54.143 --> 41:56.811
You get your butt down there
or I'll forget that my wife

41:56.813 --> 42:00.547
is your sister and fire
your sorry ass.

42:00.549 --> 42:01.583
Fine.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.626
God dang it.

42:12.628 --> 42:15.299
What's your problem now, Jed?

42:16.732 --> 42:18.900
It's my dumb brotherinlaw.

42:18.902 --> 42:23.105
Wants me to go down and
check out Sarsaparilla Trail.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.440
So what?

42:25.442 --> 42:27.942
I'm on my lunch hour.

42:27.944 --> 42:30.777
You've been here for an
hour and a half already.

42:30.779 --> 42:32.915
That's not the point.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.219
I'm a law man.

42:36.518 --> 42:41.723
As far as I'm concerned, I
deserve a little bit of leeway.

42:41.725 --> 42:45.360
Besides, I work hard
for this city.

42:45.362 --> 42:46.761
Since when?

42:46.763 --> 42:51.902
That'll be
enough out of you.

42:52.701 --> 42:54.402
Another beer, if you please.

42:54.404 --> 42:56.436
I thought you were leaving.

42:56.438 --> 42:57.904
Soon enough.

42:57.906 --> 43:00.608
Sarsaparilla Trail's
just right over there.

43:00.610 --> 43:04.846
Ain't nobody gonna get
killed over one beer.

43:04.848 --> 43:09.583
Besides, why do I get stuck
with all the crap jobs?

43:09.585 --> 43:11.286
Why can't my dumb brotherinlaw

43:11.288 --> 43:15.489
go and check out that
stupid Sarsaparilla Trail?

43:15.491 --> 43:18.092
But you're practically
already there.

43:18.094 --> 43:21.728
You know, I come here
for a sympathetic ear

43:21.730 --> 43:24.532
and all I get is grief.

43:24.534 --> 43:26.933
I don't even know why
I come here.

43:26.935 --> 43:28.069
I assume it's because
you're always

43:28.071 --> 43:30.570
trying to look down my shirt.

43:30.572 --> 43:31.773
Oh, yeah.

43:31.775 --> 43:35.112
That's it.

43:36.212 --> 43:39.816
Guess I'll see you at
church on Sunday.

43:40.650 --> 43:42.051
See you then.

43:43.453 --> 43:46.123
I'm headed out the back door.

44:17.654 --> 44:18.989
What the hell?

44:27.496 --> 44:28.429
No, no!

44:28.431 --> 44:29.299
No!

45:24.654 --> 45:27.054
He wants the groceries.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.450
No!

46:26.215 --> 46:27.581
Hello?

46:27.583 --> 46:28.449
Hey, Daddy.

46:28.451 --> 46:29.750
What's up?

46:29.752 --> 46:31.117
You have to find out
who that board

46:31.119 --> 46:33.119
originally belonged to.

46:33.121 --> 46:36.991
I believe they've used it
to entrap an animal spirit.

46:36.993 --> 46:38.525
How am I supposed to do that?

46:38.527 --> 46:41.329
We didn't even find
the board this morning.

46:41.331 --> 46:42.364
What?

46:42.366 --> 46:43.730
Find that board.

46:43.732 --> 46:45.733
I'm going to consult a medium.

46:45.735 --> 46:48.569
I'll let you know if
I learn more.

46:48.571 --> 46:51.806
I still have no way to find
out who the original owner is.

46:51.808 --> 46:53.907
Jill, you've denied
it for years,

46:53.909 --> 46:56.543
but your family has a
history with the occult.

46:56.545 --> 46:58.779
That's probably why the
board was drawn to you

46:58.781 --> 47:00.449
in the first place.

47:01.317 --> 47:02.983
Okay, but, but.

47:02.985 --> 47:07.922
That same connection will
help you find the owner.

47:07.924 --> 47:10.757
All right, if you say so.

47:10.759 --> 47:11.694
Bye, Daddy.

47:25.141 --> 47:27.541
Oh, my god, Donna.

47:27.543 --> 47:28.411
Kim, no!

47:29.311 --> 47:30.246
Oh, my god.

47:32.581 --> 47:34.518
Hey, what did I miss?

47:40.857 --> 47:42.255
What the hell is that
nogood hillbilly

47:42.257 --> 47:45.293
brotherinlaw of mine up to now?

47:45.295 --> 47:45.996
Voicemail?

47:47.130 --> 47:51.568
That man is chained to his
desk next time I see him.

48:30.005 --> 48:33.243
What the hell's going
on around here?

48:52.694 --> 48:53.927
This way, hurry.

48:53.929 --> 48:54.795
Is it behind us?

48:54.797 --> 48:55.730
I don't know.

48:55.732 --> 48:56.596
Well, is it still following us?

48:56.598 --> 48:57.665
I don't know, Tiffany.

48:57.667 --> 49:00.300
For God's sake, calm down.

49:00.302 --> 49:02.637
All right, I don't see it.

49:02.639 --> 49:03.804
Good.

49:03.806 --> 49:06.040
Okay, if we're gonna
get out of this thing,

49:06.042 --> 49:07.108
we have to stay quiet.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.476
What the hell is going on?

49:08.478 --> 49:10.978
It's a flying ghost shark
for crying out loud.

49:10.980 --> 49:12.579
That kind of thing
doesn't happen.

49:12.581 --> 49:13.614
I know, I know.

49:13.616 --> 49:14.882
Ghost sharks?

49:14.884 --> 49:16.817
Who even thought that
was a thing?

49:16.819 --> 49:18.418
We gotta stay quiet, okay?

49:18.420 --> 49:20.154
We don't want that
thing to hear us.

49:20.156 --> 49:22.357
Do you know where it came from?

49:22.359 --> 49:23.958
I think it came out of
the Ouija board

49:23.960 --> 49:25.393
that we've been using.

49:25.395 --> 49:25.826
What?

49:25.828 --> 49:27.094
The Ouija board.

49:27.096 --> 49:29.529
I think we somehow summoned
it out of the board.

49:29.531 --> 49:31.699
I thought
that was just some game.

49:31.701 --> 49:32.900
I know, me too.

49:32.902 --> 49:34.235
Who knew?

49:34.237 --> 49:36.103
What are we going to do?

49:36.105 --> 49:37.471
All right.

49:37.473 --> 49:42.342
First thing's first, we gotta
get the hell out of here.

49:42.344 --> 49:43.212
Wait.

49:44.413 --> 49:45.282
Listen.

49:46.681 --> 49:47.551
Get down.

49:52.788 --> 49:54.688
That was close.

49:54.690 --> 49:55.292
Okay.

49:56.359 --> 49:59.992
If ugly's going that way,
we're going that way.

49:59.994 --> 50:00.864
Got it.

50:07.369 --> 50:08.034
Oh, God.

50:08.036 --> 50:09.003
Shit.

50:10.873 --> 50:11.741
Run!

50:21.116 --> 50:23.050
No, we have to stick together.

50:24.654 --> 50:25.487
Tiffany!

50:25.489 --> 50:26.154
Keep running.

50:26.156 --> 50:28.422
I'll meet you at your car.

50:28.424 --> 50:29.724
Just...

50:29.726 --> 50:31.025
Just get up and run.

50:31.027 --> 50:32.429
Get up and run!

50:38.433 --> 50:39.301
Oh, no.

50:45.907 --> 50:46.775
Damn it.

51:28.585 --> 51:29.483
What the hell?

51:29.485 --> 51:33.320
You can't sneak up on
people like that.

51:33.322 --> 51:35.355
Where did you get that?

51:35.357 --> 51:39.125
It's controlled
by the board.

51:39.127 --> 51:40.393
I mean, who the hell are you?

51:40.395 --> 51:42.029
I know of the board.

51:42.031 --> 51:43.764
It belongs to me.

51:43.766 --> 51:48.101
The spirit of the shark
was placed within it by me.

51:48.103 --> 51:49.203
Well, that's the...

51:49.205 --> 51:51.237
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

51:51.239 --> 51:55.643
Crazier than
what you've seen today?

51:55.645 --> 51:56.346
I guess not.

51:57.447 --> 51:59.313
My father says you're the
only one who can stop it.

51:59.315 --> 52:00.581
Perhaps.

52:00.583 --> 52:02.483
I have dabbled with powers
that I shouldn't have.

52:02.485 --> 52:05.384
I tapped into elemental
forces to try to control it,

52:05.386 --> 52:07.286
but you cannot control the
sheer brutality

52:07.288 --> 52:08.655
of the great white shark.

52:08.657 --> 52:11.291
Even one that has passed
through the land of the living.

52:11.293 --> 52:13.259
Well, can we use the board

52:13.261 --> 52:15.029
to send it back where
it came from?

52:15.031 --> 52:16.764
I don't know.

52:16.766 --> 52:18.132
I can't believe this
is happening.

52:18.134 --> 52:19.333
It's all true.

52:19.335 --> 52:21.034
The shark has killed now
and will keep killing

52:21.036 --> 52:24.170
unless I can return it
to the board.

52:24.172 --> 52:26.909
Well, we have to do something.

52:29.944 --> 52:30.813
Oh, shit.

52:38.087 --> 52:39.489
Where'd you go?

52:53.235 --> 52:55.768
You've come to the right place,
Anthony.

52:55.770 --> 52:59.338
I can feel the otherworldly
forces all dancing around you.

52:59.340 --> 53:01.708
You can save the
dramatics for the rubes.

53:01.710 --> 53:05.378
I just need to know if there's
a way to help my daughter.

53:05.380 --> 53:08.049
The future is often
difficult to see.

53:08.051 --> 53:09.518
Always changing.

53:12.589 --> 53:15.556
However, the present
is less of a challenge.

53:15.558 --> 53:17.625
Your daughter is in danger.

53:17.627 --> 53:18.991
Right now.

53:18.993 --> 53:20.393
The beast is hunting her.

53:20.395 --> 53:22.496
What can we do to stop it?

53:22.498 --> 53:24.465
There must be something.

53:24.467 --> 53:25.666
I will try to distract it,

53:25.668 --> 53:28.668
but if it becomes aware
of our interference,

53:28.670 --> 53:31.070
it may turn its
attention towards us.

53:31.072 --> 53:32.840
We have to take that chance.

53:32.842 --> 53:34.507
We'll be safe as long as
I break contact

53:34.509 --> 53:37.311
with the crystal ball
before it moves our way.

53:37.313 --> 53:38.945
Okay.

53:38.947 --> 53:40.482
Do what you must.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.751
I didn't think that
was gonna work.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.333
What's happening?

54:32.335 --> 54:33.233
What do you see?

54:33.235 --> 54:34.434
Patience.

54:34.436 --> 54:37.003
I've never done anything
like this before.

54:37.005 --> 54:39.040
The strain is incredible.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.775
Of course.

54:40.777 --> 54:41.644
I'm sorry.

54:42.411 --> 54:44.143
But a shark...

54:44.145 --> 54:45.378
The shark is watching.

54:45.380 --> 54:47.581
No, you have to distract it.

54:47.583 --> 54:50.920
Doing so would only
put us in peril.

54:53.723 --> 54:54.590
Hey!

54:55.725 --> 54:56.592
Over here!

54:57.826 --> 54:59.159
Fresh meat!

54:59.161 --> 55:00.427
Come on, you son of a

55:13.409 --> 55:16.944
Mama told me there'd be
days like this.

55:35.096 --> 55:37.100
It's unnaturally cold.

56:03.324 --> 56:06.259
What the hell's that noise?

56:15.938 --> 56:16.806
Jeez.

56:27.382 --> 56:28.250
Jeez.

56:30.485 --> 56:31.351
Open up!

56:31.353 --> 56:32.253
Let me in, let me in!

56:36.058 --> 56:37.357
Oh, jeez.

56:37.359 --> 56:38.228
Open up!

56:39.395 --> 56:40.929
Come on.

56:46.768 --> 56:48.569
What the hell is that thing?

56:48.571 --> 56:50.471
I don't think you'd
believe me if I told you.

56:50.473 --> 56:54.442
It looked like some sort
of flying ghost shark.

56:54.444 --> 56:56.009
Okay, maybe you
would believe me.

56:56.011 --> 56:57.980
Is it still out there?

56:58.880 --> 57:00.947
No, I think the board
warded it off.

57:00.949 --> 57:02.349
The board?

57:02.351 --> 57:03.516
What the hell are you
talking about?

57:03.518 --> 57:05.018
Listen, I can
explain everything.

57:05.020 --> 57:06.822
Just follow me, okay?

57:07.788 --> 57:10.726
You got a permit for that gun?

57:19.301 --> 57:21.101
How is this possible?

57:21.103 --> 57:21.871
Magic.

57:22.737 --> 57:25.639
That makes me feel so
much better.

57:25.641 --> 57:27.241
What are we gonna do?

57:27.243 --> 57:29.842
Look, we have the chance
to end this now, okay?

57:29.844 --> 57:32.145
But you're gonna have to
do what I say.

57:32.147 --> 57:33.579
This is crazy.

57:33.581 --> 57:36.049
Pull yourself together,
all right?

57:36.051 --> 57:41.023
There's gotta be a way for the
board to get us out of this.

57:41.857 --> 57:43.759
Where's the planchette?

57:45.027 --> 57:46.828
Use this.

57:48.563 --> 57:49.299
Come on.

57:50.531 --> 57:54.902
Is there anybody out
there that can help us?

57:54.904 --> 57:55.905
The shark.

57:58.306 --> 58:00.576
Is there anybody there?

58:12.288 --> 58:13.156
Dad?

58:14.322 --> 58:15.857
But that means...

58:16.958 --> 58:17.625
Oh, God.

58:17.627 --> 58:18.895
Not you, too.

58:45.154 --> 58:47.023
I love you too, Daddy.

58:50.860 --> 58:51.728
Goodbye.

59:01.469 --> 59:02.337
Oh, no.

59:04.038 --> 59:04.906
I'm dead.

59:09.411 --> 59:10.811
You hear that?

59:10.813 --> 59:13.547
You can't hurt me anymore!

59:17.386 --> 59:18.253
Hey.

59:20.389 --> 59:22.723
I've got to use my
occult training.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.063
Mystic shield.

59:46.114 --> 59:47.514
What happened?

59:47.516 --> 59:48.451
Did he win?

59:49.585 --> 59:50.853
I can't tell.

59:51.686 --> 59:54.223
What's stronger than a shark?

59:55.958 --> 59:58.360
Love in the human spirit.

01:00:12.607 --> 01:00:14.174
Fuck you, bitchface!

01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:19.380
It's not working.

01:00:21.516 --> 01:00:22.815
Maybe this will.

01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:25.184
This is for my dad, you
aquatic douchebag.

01:00:41.737 --> 01:00:43.036
That takes care of that.

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:46.172
Screwing with Ouija
boards is a terrible idea.

01:00:46.174 --> 01:00:47.043
No duh.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:50.244
I could use a drink.

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.114
You?

01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:54.715
I could use about six.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.085
And some sushi.

01:00:57.284 --> 01:00:58.221
Too soon.

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:30.342
What is it?

01:02:30.344 --> 01:02:31.214
It's me.

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:33.514
Mission accomplished.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:37.150
Everything on the eastern
coast has been completed.

01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:39.953
The project appears to
have been a success.

01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:40.887
Right, right.

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.755
Right, I got it.

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:44.424
How did the experiment go?

01:02:44.426 --> 01:02:47.964
It's really, really,
really important.

01:02:48.964 --> 01:02:51.599
The experiment went very well,
sir.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.768
We can expect that very
soon it can go worldwide.

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:56.936
Excellent.

01:02:56.938 --> 01:02:59.572
Prepare phase two of
Operation Ouija Shark.

01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:01.243
It's gonna be huge.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:35.348
