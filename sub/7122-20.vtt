00:32.069 --> 00:34.844
Okay. I'm going to
lower the screen.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.406
Tell me what you see.

00:36.472 --> 00:38.884
Crunchy, you look
like a rainbow.

00:38.941 --> 00:41.251
It's beautiful. Can
you guys see that?

00:41.310 --> 00:43.257
Nope, only you can
see it because

00:43.313 --> 00:45.919
you're hooked up to
the aura visualizer.

00:45.983 --> 00:47.860
But actually, I'm lying.

00:47.918 --> 00:50.365
We can see everything
you see on this screen.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.526
Now I'm gonna send that
image into Crunchy.

00:52.589 --> 00:53.590
Whoa!

00:53.657 --> 00:55.193
The aura's gone.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.000
- Except...
- Whoa!

00:57.061 --> 00:58.769
Crunchy's true
essence manifested

00:58.830 --> 01:00.435
in the material plane.

01:00.499 --> 01:02.568
I want to see Peppermint
Butler's aura!

01:02.634 --> 01:04.977
You don't want to see that.

01:05.036 --> 01:07.448
Yeah, we do! Right, Princess?

01:07.505 --> 01:10.281
Sure, Finn. Just let me
recalibrate the device.

01:10.341 --> 01:13.552
No! Bunk that. I'm tired.
Come on, Finn.

01:13.613 --> 01:15.215
Oh, yeah.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.352
Yeah, me and Jake,
we got to peace out.

01:17.416 --> 01:18.691
Goodnight.

01:20.586 --> 01:21.929
Hey, what's going on in here?

01:21.987 --> 01:24.594
- Yo, guys!
- Hey, Finn.

01:24.658 --> 01:26.605
Whoa, what's that?
Security cams?

01:26.661 --> 01:29.073
Yeah, man. You gotta
see some crazy stu...

01:29.130 --> 01:30.472
Yo, shut up!

01:30.530 --> 01:32.033
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.374
Nothing.

01:33.434 --> 01:35.573
- What is it?
- Nothing!

01:35.636 --> 01:37.206
Show us now!

01:37.271 --> 01:38.477
Show you what?

01:38.539 --> 01:39.985
What you said!

01:40.041 --> 01:41.576
We didn't say nothing!

01:41.641 --> 01:43.246
It's too late for take backs!

01:43.311 --> 01:44.985
We practically know
everything already!

01:45.047 --> 01:46.492
Now show us!

01:46.547 --> 01:48.494
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.

01:48.550 --> 01:50.723
Yeah, this is our weird secret.

01:50.786 --> 01:51.889
Of course, dude.

01:51.953 --> 01:53.991
All right. Now look
at monitor three.

01:54.056 --> 01:55.661
Can you see it?

01:55.724 --> 01:58.432
Oh, yeah. That's uh...
Who is that?

01:58.494 --> 02:00.099
That's Chocoberry.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.972
Why you guys spying
on Chocoberry?

02:02.031 --> 02:04.136
No, man. Look there,
in the corner.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.908
- Who's that?
- Zoom in, dude.

02:06.970 --> 02:09.644
Plus, plus, plus, plus,
plus, plus, plus, plus...

02:09.705 --> 02:12.415
Lemongrab! What the...?!

02:12.476 --> 02:15.082
This is our weird secret, okay?

02:15.146 --> 02:16.590
Remember that.

02:18.649 --> 02:20.788
How long has this been going on?

02:20.851 --> 02:23.492
He's shown up every night
for the past two weeks.

02:23.555 --> 02:26.126
He goes to different rooms
and just stands there.

02:26.191 --> 02:27.795
And you didn't tell me?!

02:27.859 --> 02:29.804
If we told you, then
we knew you'd mess up

02:29.861 --> 02:31.465
our weird TV show.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.477
Banana guarding is boring.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.068
I'm gonna talk to him.

02:35.133 --> 02:36.772
Oh, no. You see?

02:36.836 --> 02:38.907
Sorry, guys.

02:40.438 --> 02:42.009
Lemongrab!

02:42.074 --> 02:43.314
Nyah!

02:43.376 --> 02:45.652
Why are you stalking my peeps?!

02:45.711 --> 02:48.214
I am within my rights!

02:48.281 --> 02:50.228
Yeah, but what are you doing?

02:50.284 --> 02:52.059
It's creeping me out.

02:52.119 --> 02:53.722
Uh, I am the Earl...

02:53.786 --> 02:55.925
- Yeah?
- The Earl...

02:55.988 --> 02:57.468
<i>of nothing!</i>

02:58.525 --> 03:01.131
Wait! What do you
mean, "nothing"?

03:01.195 --> 03:04.336
Castle Lemongrab
has no citizens!

03:04.399 --> 03:06.537
You have excess candies!

03:06.600 --> 03:09.549
You must donate. Dona-a-a-te!

03:09.605 --> 03:12.313
In your dreams, you freak.

03:12.374 --> 03:14.547
But you don't get
along with others.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.850
I don't understand
you, Lemongrab.

03:16.911 --> 03:20.520
No one... no one understands!

03:20.583 --> 03:25.090
I am alone, and you
made me like this.

03:26.021 --> 03:27.933
You made me!

03:27.991 --> 03:29.971
You made me!

03:30.026 --> 03:33.064
You're... my... glob!

03:33.130 --> 03:34.836
You're my gob!

03:34.898 --> 03:37.071
What are we gonna do?

03:37.133 --> 03:39.705
Something totally bum slops.

03:39.770 --> 03:42.512
No, no! We won't go!

03:42.573 --> 03:44.575
Please! Please!

03:45.543 --> 03:47.079
All I need is three
healthy volunteers

03:47.144 --> 03:48.886
to move in with Lemongrab.

03:48.947 --> 03:51.484
He's all by himself
with no one to govern.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.257
No, no! We won't go!

03:53.318 --> 03:54.796
No, no! We won't go!

03:54.852 --> 03:56.491
Come on, Mr. Cupcake.

03:56.555 --> 03:57.829
Just for a little while?

03:57.889 --> 03:59.766
I can't, Princess.

03:59.825 --> 04:02.272
My arm is broken.

04:02.328 --> 04:04.308
Dude, you didn't
have to do that.

04:04.364 --> 04:07.038
All right, what's it
gonna take, people?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.739
Two things, Princess.

04:10.136 --> 04:12.980
Yeah, that's right.
Back up, fools.

04:13.039 --> 04:15.316
You got nerve showing
your faces here,

04:15.376 --> 04:16.878
Notorious Pup Gang.

04:16.944 --> 04:18.752
Bunch of bad apples.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.654
Back up, Finn.
I'll take you out!

04:20.713 --> 04:22.489
We came out of hiding

04:22.549 --> 04:24.825
'cause all y'all is
scared of a Lemon man.

04:24.885 --> 04:28.492
And we ain't afraid,
so we gots demands.

04:28.555 --> 04:30.092
And what is that?

04:30.158 --> 04:32.536
One... total amnesty
for past crimes

04:32.594 --> 04:34.802
committed by the Pup Gang.

04:34.864 --> 04:36.809
Hmm... granted.

04:36.865 --> 04:39.813
Wait. They threw a basketball
at my head one time.

04:39.869 --> 04:41.177
You gonna let that slide?

04:41.237 --> 04:43.513
<i>We only did that
'cause you're old.</i>

04:43.572 --> 04:46.212
You sacks! I'll rip your cups!

04:46.275 --> 04:49.620
Jake, please. What is
your second demand?

04:49.679 --> 04:51.819
We want the big
cash-money wad...

04:51.882 --> 04:54.987
Enough to provide for
our delinquent mothers

04:55.052 --> 04:57.463
so that, hopefully,
they'll show us the love

04:57.520 --> 05:01.367
we always dreamed about
in our sad, young lives.

05:01.425 --> 05:02.699
Huh.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.570
I grant you the big
cash-money wad!

05:05.630 --> 05:08.509
Now off with you to
Castle Lemongrab!

05:10.201 --> 05:11.578
Yo, Lemongrease.

05:11.636 --> 05:13.844
We're gonna live here
at Lemongrabs now.

05:13.906 --> 05:14.940
Yes.

05:15.006 --> 05:19.149
I'm Jamaica, and this
is Toughy and Blombo.

05:19.211 --> 05:21.555
Blombo, what is that?

05:21.613 --> 05:24.116
- What?
- On Blombo's ears?

05:24.183 --> 05:25.662
That's his headphones.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.698
Blombo, take them off!

05:27.753 --> 05:31.725
Blombo! You must heed
my instructions!

05:31.791 --> 05:33.395
<i>Take off your things!</i>

05:33.460 --> 05:36.202
Whoa, settle down, Lemongrease.

05:36.262 --> 05:38.208
I am not grease!

05:38.264 --> 05:41.474
This is unacceptable!

05:41.535 --> 05:43.480
What? What's going on?

05:43.536 --> 05:47.849
All unfit citizens of Lemongrab
must be reconditioned!

05:47.908 --> 05:49.819
Man, are you crazy?

05:49.877 --> 05:53.825
Yo-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u!

05:53.881 --> 05:57.489
M-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!

05:57.552 --> 06:00.556
I have to use my
sound sword now!

06:05.027 --> 06:07.633
You guys.

06:07.697 --> 06:09.505
What... where are we?

06:09.564 --> 06:12.843
You are in my
reconditioning chamber.

06:12.903 --> 06:16.509
You will receive four to
three units of juice now.

06:19.076 --> 06:23.355
Ooh-ah!

06:23.414 --> 06:26.361
♪ Crunchy. Wake up, Crunchy ♪

06:28.852 --> 06:31.230
Eh? Glob, is that you?

06:31.288 --> 06:33.235
No sign of Lemongrab
for three days.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.236
I think it worked.

06:35.292 --> 06:37.273
Maybe. Let's keep looking.

06:39.531 --> 06:41.478
Aw, geez.

06:45.036 --> 06:46.913
Hey! - Huh?

06:46.971 --> 06:49.213
What happened to
your new citizens?

06:49.275 --> 06:51.482
They didn't understand
my Lemonstylz.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.148
I like this way better.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.022
<i>Hmm... I wonder if maybe
you don't understand</i>

06:56.081 --> 06:57.992
<i>their Candy stylz.</i>

06:58.050 --> 07:00.861
Come on! Let me
show you something.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.391
You see, Earl, candy
people are mad special.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.998
They need constant
stroking and snuggling.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.519
Here, you try.

07:22.244 --> 07:23.688
Ha-ha, ha! Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha!

07:25.247 --> 07:27.693
Goo-goo, uh, g-goo!

07:35.925 --> 07:37.462
Put you in my oven!

07:37.528 --> 07:39.666
Nyah! It's gross!

07:39.729 --> 07:42.437
And who says your
Way's right, anyway?

07:42.499 --> 07:44.945
I look in the
Lemonheart you gave me

07:45.001 --> 07:47.174
and see my Lemonway to act,

07:47.237 --> 07:49.240
and that must be right!

07:55.312 --> 07:57.656
Man, that guy's a real d-list.

07:57.715 --> 08:00.559
Oh, dear. His candy citizens!

08:00.618 --> 08:02.462
Let's crush this mess
all accordingly!

08:02.521 --> 08:04.125
Crazy light-bulb freestyle!

08:04.189 --> 08:05.190
Yeah!

08:05.256 --> 08:07.794
No. He's my responsibility.

08:07.858 --> 08:09.668
I have to try to help him.

08:09.728 --> 08:12.539
- Okay, that's cool, too.
- Hop on.

08:12.598 --> 08:13.598
Hup!

08:18.503 --> 08:20.711
Lemongrab?

08:20.773 --> 08:22.185
Lemongrab?

08:22.241 --> 08:23.720
No Lemongrab.

08:23.776 --> 08:26.087
Come on. Let's find
the Pup Gang quick.

08:27.881 --> 08:30.885
Wait. I have a plan.
You guys go on ahead.

08:30.951 --> 08:32.294
Okay, cool.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.700
Hmm.

08:37.325 --> 08:39.601
What do you got, Jake?

08:39.660 --> 08:42.267
Just an empty room
with a Catcher's mitt.

08:42.330 --> 08:45.141
Weird.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.012
Oh. Oh, no!

08:49.070 --> 08:51.175
Oh! Ah! Goonie-goo-goo-foofie!

08:52.808 --> 08:54.481
Kooky-kooky-kooky!

08:56.612 --> 08:58.785
This is serious!

08:58.847 --> 09:01.453
Pup Gang got four units.

09:01.517 --> 09:05.126
Maybe... maybe 10 units
for trespassers!

09:12.329 --> 09:14.276
You got tricks, huh?

09:14.332 --> 09:16.278
Got to fall down sometime,

09:16.334 --> 09:18.281
and when you do...

09:18.337 --> 09:20.749
12 units!

09:20.806 --> 09:22.751
Lemongrab, stop!

09:22.807 --> 09:23.751
Huh?

09:23.808 --> 09:26.254
Please, Earl. I can help you.

09:26.310 --> 09:29.588
No! No! No more helping!

09:29.648 --> 09:32.151
You're the one who
made me this way!

09:32.217 --> 09:34.322
How can you help?!

09:34.386 --> 09:37.333
You unload your
punkest boys on me?

09:37.389 --> 09:40.496
You try to change my ways.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.939
You poison! You poison!

09:43.998 --> 09:46.101
You need reconditioning!

09:46.165 --> 09:48.771
Reconditio-o-o-o-n!

09:48.835 --> 09:51.111
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

09:54.141 --> 09:56.087
Yo-u-u-u-u!

09:56.143 --> 09:58.749
N-o-o-o!

10:02.150 --> 10:04.151
Whoa, whoa. What the hey?

10:04.218 --> 10:07.598
Wait, Lemongrab. Look!

10:07.656 --> 10:09.602
Hello?

10:09.658 --> 10:11.604
Am I in the right room?

10:11.660 --> 10:13.401
Huh? What?

10:13.461 --> 10:15.601
Who's this rigmarole?

10:15.665 --> 10:18.339
- I'm Lemongrab.
- Oh.

10:18.401 --> 10:21.177
I made him for you
in your pantry,

10:21.237 --> 10:22.841
for you to be with.

10:22.905 --> 10:25.512
Two L-Lemongrabs?

10:25.575 --> 10:27.748
Hmm?

10:35.852 --> 10:37.297
Hmm.

10:37.354 --> 10:38.891
Yeah, okay!

10:38.956 --> 10:40.025
Yeah!

10:43.095 --> 10:46.166
All in favor of pardoning
the prisoners?

10:46.230 --> 10:47.436
Aye!

10:47.498 --> 10:50.104
Pardons for all!

10:50.168 --> 10:52.376
Goodbye, Lemongrabs! Goodbye!

10:52.437 --> 10:53.849
Take care, boys!

10:53.906 --> 10:56.978
Yes. Yes, indeed. Ha ha!

10:57.042 --> 10:59.488
A lemon gives by taking.

10:59.545 --> 11:02.321
And cares by yelling.

11:02.381 --> 11:04.452
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

11:04.516 --> 11:08.123
Well, okay! Stop by anytime!

11:08.187 --> 11:10.065
But call first!

11:10.123 --> 11:11.967
Yes, goodbye!
