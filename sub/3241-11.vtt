But I have one thing to ask ye.

Honesty.

When you do tell me something,

And I'll promise you the same.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.845
I agree.

Then there's one thing I must ask you,

(WHISPERS) Are you a witch?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.891
Are you serious?

I've often seen that scar

40:05.160 --> 40:07.686
Until I saw the same
on Geillis Duncan today.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.403
She called it the Devil's mark.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.004
I'm not a witch.

After you hear the truth,
then maybe you'll think otherwise.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.202
I've never had smallpox.

But I can walk through

40:49.360 --> 40:52.125
I can nurse the sick,
but their sickness cannot touch me.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.731
This mark is called a vaccine.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.360
And you've never heard of it.
No one here has.

41:03.240 --> 41:06.050
But it prevents me
from contracting the disease.

41:12.960 --> 41:17.045
I know about Jack Randall

41:18.840 --> 41:22.367
I know the day he was born,
and I know the day he will die,

41:22.440 --> 41:24.363

he works for the Duke of Sandringham

41:24.440 --> 41:27.011
