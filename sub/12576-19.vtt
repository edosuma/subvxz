WEBVTT

00:38.496 --> 00:40.957
You know, I am a
substitute teacher.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.876
I would be happy to substitute

00:43.001 --> 00:44.544
for your mama while she's in prison.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.087
Thanks, Aunt Peggy.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.507
But I don't think mama would want
anyone to take her place.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.844
Well, unless they took
her place in prison.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.347
But I guess that's too much to ask.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.227
We did good, son. It's beautiful.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.774
We did it. We finished making
dad's new workbench.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.442
Look, no splinters.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.652
What should we build first, son?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.529
Well, how about a go-cart?

01:11.988 --> 01:15.116
Okay. first, we'll work out
the design flaws

01:15.200 --> 01:17.911
of your go-cart by building a TV cabinet.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.122
Mama got out of prison!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.709
Oh, I knew it. I just knew it.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.377
I told them medium security

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505
would not be enough to hold that woman.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.215
Oh, she didn't escape.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.800
She was released!

01:32.425 --> 01:34.260
She's coming to visit on Saturday.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.387
Uh, she's coming here?

01:36.596 --> 01:38.306
Oh, I can't wait to tell daddy.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.060
Oh, we're going to be a family again.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.812
I will tongue-kiss Bill

01:43.812 --> 01:45.730
before I let that tramp in my house.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.816
Whoa.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.359
Yeah, I was all set

01:49.359 --> 01:51.861
to start on a TV cabinet on Saturday

01:51.945 --> 01:53.613
but it's going to have to wait a day.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.824
Luanne's mama's coming to visit.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.661
That woman is a menace to society.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.040
Well, I don't know. I never met the lady,
but she did her time.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.459
I tell you what, man. Ain't no dang
ol' lady about her, man.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.877
Getting all liquored-up, man.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.338
Comin' on, throwing up, pawing me like
a dang ol' animal, man.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.339
I told her no means no.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.883
Yeah, Leanne's bad news, I tell you what.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.510
Peggy's brother was all set

02:15.635 --> 02:17.387
to marry a pretty pharmacist gal

02:17.387 --> 02:20.765
until Leanne entertained
at his bachelor party.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.393
So he marries Leanne...

02:23.393 --> 02:25.854
...and after 18 years of drunken hell,

02:25.854 --> 02:27.564
she stabs him with a fork.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.440
- Hm.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.733
Ow!

02:30.817 --> 02:32.485
Oh, my foot!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.028
- I think it's broken.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.947
Well, if it's broken

02:35.947 --> 02:37.657
you're going to have to get that shoe off.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.743
No. No, I feel better now.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.037
I'm just going to go on home.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.373
- Don't be silly. Just let me...

02:45.373 --> 02:46.958
- What the...?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.376
Don't look at me!

02:48.543 --> 02:50.044
Don't look at me!

02:50.128 --> 02:52.463
Ew. I never thought I'd say this

02:52.547 --> 02:55.133
but I don't think I can finish my beer.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.261
It's some kind of athlete's foot.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.847
I've been using this spray for ten years.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.599
Quick-working, my arse.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.975
What did the doctor say?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.604
Well, the only person I ever showed
my toes to was my ex-wife.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.939
She used them against me in the divorce.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.942
You don't have to be embarrassed
about your toes, Bill.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.402
It's just a medical condition.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.737
Sure, that's what you say.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.990
But I don't see you waving
your narrow urethra around

03:18.990 --> 03:19.908
for everyone to see.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.412
Daddy, give her another chance.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.998
Okay.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.752
We're never going to be a family
again, Aunt Peggy.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.629
He won't forgive mama.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.797
Honey, marriage is about trust

03:35.173 --> 03:37.467
and she, well, she betrayed him.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.219
It was like a knife in his heart

03:39.219 --> 03:41.012
when she stuck that fork in his back.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.555
That was the old mama.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.474
See, the new mama quit drinking.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.476
She won't even eat with a fork.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.603
Oh, Luanne, I am just so proud

03:48.603 --> 03:50.897
of everything you've accomplished
since we took you in.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.150
You're in school. You've got a righteous
Christian puppet show.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.985
- You're always so very clean.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.154
I just do not want you to get distracted

03:58.238 --> 03:59.948
and lose your way, honey.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.326
Oh, you don't have to worry about me,
Aunt Peggy.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.036
That's my mama's job.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.207
<i>Don't make any sudden moves.</i>

04:09.207 --> 04:10.708
Don't look her in the eye

04:10.792 --> 04:12.752
and if I give you this signal...

04:13.753 --> 04:15.838
...run to Dale's house and stay there

04:15.922 --> 04:17.048
till I say it's safe.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.135
She's here!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
Mama!

04:26.474 --> 04:27.767
Lulu!

04:28.017 --> 04:31.396
Oh, my sweet baby girlfriend!

04:34.315 --> 04:36.067
Thanks for the lift, Alicia.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.361
Mm-hmm. All right then.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.409
It's the Hill family.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.370
Leanne, how very nice to see you.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.456
Oh, you have such a lovely home here.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.917
Of course, if somebody
turned on a fire hose

04:53.001 --> 04:54.002
it would all be ruined.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.217
Yeah. So, do you have a job?

05:01.342 --> 05:02.468
No.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.971
And Lulu said the trailer's wrecked

05:05.179 --> 05:08.433
so I guess I'm currently unresidented.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.609
- Why don't you stay here?
- Bobby.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.032
Wouldn't you be more comfortable

05:24.032 --> 05:26.326
in some kind of a halfway house

05:26.326 --> 05:27.702
or institution?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.413
Please? I'll clean up after her...

05:30.413 --> 05:31.998
Oh, that's okay, Lulu.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.500
I am so sorry for all the grief

05:34.751 --> 05:36.544
I caused you when I was drinking.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.546
I am walking with the Lord now

05:38.546 --> 05:40.965
and I know I have found His forgiveness.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.968
I just hope I will find yours someday.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.470
Well, we'll let you know.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.638
Oh, mama!

05:47.722 --> 05:49.891
I love you so much!

05:49.891 --> 05:52.643
I love you, too, baby doll!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.313
We'll get an apartment, mama.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.856
I'll quit school

05:56.856 --> 05:58.107
and I'll get a job.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.567
Baby, you mean it?

05:59.817 --> 06:00.651
Okay, then.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.653
Whoa, Whoa. You will not quit school.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.572
Leanne, you can stay here

06:04.572 --> 06:06.657
until you find a job to support yourself.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.785
Oh, bless you, Peg!

06:08.785 --> 06:10.078
I won't even stay in the house.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.204
I'll sleep in the garage.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.206
What? No, my workbench.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.791
You can't stay out there...

06:14.791 --> 06:16.626
I'll fix it up real nice for you, mama.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.211
Thank you. Thank you.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.381
Well, what choice did we have?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.550
<i>Doctor Escomea,
Doctor Escomea, please come to x-ray.</i>

06:27.053 --> 06:28.513
Norman Schwarzkopf?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
Uh, yep.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.725
Okay, Norman, you have
a common toe fungus.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.978
Just take one of these pills every day,
and you'll be good as new.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.356
I've lived with this nightmare
for ten years

06:38.356 --> 06:40.191
and all I got to do is take these pills?

06:40.358 --> 06:41.317
Yeah, that's right.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.152
Now, you got to take them
on a full stomach.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.154
Can do!

06:45.363 --> 06:48.032
And absolutely no alcohol.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.079
Hmm.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.124
How long is she going to stay here?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.209
I am sick and tired of scrambling around

06:58.209 --> 07:01.170
to find nutritious meals
that do not require a fork.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.342
Hey, Leanne, how's that, uh,
job search coming along?

07:06.592 --> 07:07.760
Not so good.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.847
My best reference just went in
for chemical castration.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.935
Mama, I want you to meet my Buckley.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.980
Go on, like we practiced.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.607
Hey.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.027
Well, he's just gorgeous!

07:25.111 --> 07:27.071
Ooh, feel these muscles!

07:27.697 --> 07:28.573
I got to go.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.657
Oh.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.118
Thanks for the ride!

07:32.827 --> 07:35.121
Look. Twin dresses!

07:36.122 --> 07:38.833
I got them for us to wear
to our very first mother-daughter

07:38.833 --> 07:41.502
make-over night at the beauty academy.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.838
I'll meet you there
after your classes tonight.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.715
I'm gonna go shower and shave right now.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.259
Close the door this time.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.761
Yup.

07:50.845 --> 07:51.679
Yup.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.347
Yup.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.724
Yup-yup-yup.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.933
What a great day, huh?

07:56.017 --> 07:57.435
What a great day to be alive.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.395
Hey, who wants to play some hacky-sack?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.521
I do. I'll start.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.190
Good hack!

08:04.734 --> 08:06.360
Ooh! Easy, there!

08:07.111 --> 08:09.197
Wh-where'd it go?
Oh, there it is! I got it!

08:09.489 --> 08:11.032
Bill, we're all really happy

08:11.032 --> 08:13.576
that your toe fungus died
but we don't want

08:13.576 --> 08:16.245
to look at your feet
every five minutes, okay?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.253
Hm.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.507
Uh... Oh!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.300
I-I'm sorry. Well, hi.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.260
You must be Luanne's mama, huh?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.764
That's funny. Most people think me
and Lulu are sisters.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.390
Would you do me?

08:37.266 --> 08:38.142
Hah...

08:38.309 --> 08:40.019
Well, don't be shy. I'm running late.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.774
Beer.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.860
You know how long it's been
since I had a drink?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.821
391 days.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.908
I've been sober the whole time.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.660
Well, help yourself.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.453
I was just going to surprise Hank

08:57.662 --> 08:58.871
and leave them in his fridge.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.998
I'm not allowed to have any alcohol.

09:01.082 --> 09:01.916
Doctor's orders.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.252
Me either. Court orders.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.504
I can't be around any of my old friends

09:06.629 --> 09:08.506
'cause all they do is drink.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.632
Mine, too.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.050
I guess you and me

09:11.050 --> 09:13.469
are just going to have
to make new friends, huh?

09:13.928 --> 09:14.804
Hah.

09:15.930 --> 09:16.847
Ow!

09:23.980 --> 09:26.148
MRS. KREMZER: Miss Platter,
where is this mother

09:26.232 --> 09:28.150
you've been going on and on about?

09:28.526 --> 09:29.902
Oh, uh, she's on her way.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.654
Yeah. Sure.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.117
So, you like being in the army?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.785
Oh, yeah, I love it.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.287
I love it.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.122
They tell us when to get up

09:41.289 --> 09:43.249
what to wear, when to eat.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.501
They take all the guesswork out of living.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.503
Well, that's kind of like prison.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.046
The best part was the food.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.298
Three meals a day.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.882
Yeah, us, too.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.010
Did y'all have those meal trays?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.636
Yeah. Five compartments.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.054
Oh, we only had four.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.180
Well, that follows.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.515
You're in there to be punished.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.477
Why, is that clear nail polish?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.565
I just love a man
who takes care of his feet!

10:07.690 --> 10:10.526
Well, you only get two.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.237
Well, did you know
there's a spot on your foot

10:13.321 --> 10:15.865
that's connected to every part
of your whole body?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.242
Do you want me to show you?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.661
You want to touch my feet?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.789
- How else can I show you, silly?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.751
Oh!

10:26.917 --> 10:28.961
I could just rub these all night.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.713
Oh, I don't know.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.007
Me having my feet rubbed all night

10:33.007 --> 10:35.760
by a pretty girl,
and feeling those... Okay.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.390
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.683
Morning.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.978
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.521
Morning.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.564
Mmm. Morning.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.150
Morning.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.946
Bill, there are some things

10:56.030 --> 10:58.074
you don't do in another man's garage.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.618
As of right now, Leanne is kicked out.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.204
Hey, Hank, see,
our relationship is just starting.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.998
It's too soon to ask her
to move into my house.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.126
We'd be moving faster
than the speed of love.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.920
Please?

11:12.963 --> 11:13.881
All right.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.468
Dang it, at this rate my new workbench
is never going to get used.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.429
Oh, it got used last night.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.389
Huh?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.391
Right after we took a little ride

11:23.391 --> 11:24.392
on your mower.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.478
I got so scared when you didn't show up

11:27.478 --> 11:29.897
I thought you started drinking again

11:29.897 --> 11:33.150
and got in an accident or a gunfight...

11:33.275 --> 11:35.569
I'm so sorry, honey girl.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.822
I just lost track of the time.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.240
Forgive me?

11:39.573 --> 11:41.283
Please close the door.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.370
Well, we still have today.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.830
Oh, sorry.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.081
Excuse me.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.916
Oh, me and Billy dee

11:48.916 --> 11:51.043
are going out to celebrate today.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.879
But I want you to see
my puppet show.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.090
- It's called The Manger Babies...
- Honey...

11:56.090 --> 11:58.050
- ...and it's about the animals...
- Honey.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.385
...that lived in Jesus' manger...

11:59.385 --> 12:02.096
- There's a donkey and...
- Honey. Homey, honey.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.015
Billy is the first good thing
to happen to me

12:05.099 --> 12:06.434
since I met your daddy.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.601
After all I've been through

12:07.685 --> 12:09.186
don't you want me to be happy?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.147
Of course I do.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.357
Well, I knew you'd understand.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.694
Oh.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.864
I would love to see your show, Luanne.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.115
Great!

12:21.323 --> 12:22.825
You could save a seat for mama

12:22.825 --> 12:24.452
in case she changes her mind.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.669
<i>♪ I've been watching you
for days now, baby ♪</i>

12:34.420 --> 12:37.548

13:17.546 --> 13:19.590
Hey, Billy. Let's go on down to ugly's

13:19.590 --> 13:21.509
and show off how in love we are.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.052
Yeah, I'd like that

13:23.385 --> 13:25.596
but I'm all tapped out
till my next paycheck.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.306
We even spent my med money.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.767
Well, that's okay.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.685
Foot rubs are free.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.896
You spoiling me.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.189
You worth it.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.024
I know that I am.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.193
Now, Le-le magic finger gonna...

13:39.568 --> 13:41.153
Oh, gosh. What is that?

13:41.612 --> 13:42.738
What? Oh.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.114
Oh, that's just a little fungus.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.533
So...

13:46.116 --> 13:48.035
What are Le-le magic fingers

13:48.035 --> 13:49.495
going to do to me?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.788
Fungus?

13:51.622 --> 13:52.998
How do you get fungus?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.333
Don't worry about it.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.086
As soon as I get paid, I'm going
to get my prescription refilled

13:57.086 --> 13:58.712
and then it'll clear up just like that.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.298
Now, you're not going
to let a little fungus

14:01.507 --> 14:02.925
come between us, are you?

14:06.428 --> 14:07.638
I'll just get some almond oil.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.942
Come and get it.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.402
Mm.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.918
Now, normally,
I'd use a clamp for this

14:38.002 --> 14:39.461
but you'll do in a pinch.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.007
Okay, if you want me
to hold it tight, say T.

14:43.674 --> 14:47.052
If you want me to hold it
real tight, say R-T.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.554
That'll be our system.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.640
All right, T.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.518
Ow! Dang it!

14:54.602 --> 14:55.853
I need my workbench.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.566
Oh.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.405
What the...?

15:11.702 --> 15:13.287
Bobby, red alert! Get over to Dale's

15:13.287 --> 15:14.663
and lock the doors. Move!

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
Peggy! Peggy, it's Leanne. She's...

15:17.750 --> 15:19.043
She's right here.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.588
Uh... hey.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.424
Bill was just inviting us to a barbecue.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.508
Why?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.802
I mean, what's the occasion?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.638
We're engaged!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.974
It was supposed to be a surprise!

15:34.224 --> 15:35.100
Ow!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.854
I need a smoke.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.193
This is the happiest day of my life.

15:50.991 --> 15:54.286
Uh, Bill... how should I put this?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.705
You know, Leanne's first husband

15:56.789 --> 15:59.333
is hiding out on an oil rig in the gulf

15:59.833 --> 16:01.835
and he swears he's not coming ashore

16:01.919 --> 16:04.046
until I fax him her death certificate.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.715
Now, what makes you think
you're going to do any better?

16:07.341 --> 16:08.384
Because she loves me.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.760
Then why did she hit you?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.011
Oh, th-that...

16:11.095 --> 16:14.264
Why, that's just a new love game
we made up yesterday.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.100
It's not... one of my favorites

16:16.100 --> 16:17.518
but she seems to like it.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.105
This goes without saying, Bill,
but just in case it doesn't,

16:21.438 --> 16:24.692
I am saying that you all cannot
live in my garage.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.610
Oh, she's moving in with me today.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.613
My house is big enough for the two of us.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.657
Maybe even more.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.745
Hey, Aunt Peggy!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.247
Look what I got.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.915
What did you do?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.709
Mama's going to love it.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.961
Mm-mm. I will not have you running around

16:43.961 --> 16:45.546
all glammed up like Phyllis Diller.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.381
You're not my mama.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.174
Mama's my mama.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.177
Luanne, you are never going
to see her for what she is.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.972
Well, I am sorry,
but I have not got time for the pain.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.974
The next time that woman breaks your heart

16:57.224 --> 16:59.685
I will not be waiting there
to say I told you so.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.603
Why won't you give mama a chance?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.189
She just really needs
us to believe in her.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.983
I believe in her, Luanne.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.735
I asked her to marry me.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.362
You're going to marry mama?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.822
Oh...

17:12.156 --> 17:13.949
This is like a fairy tale.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.161
I'm going to call you Step Daddy Bill.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.162
Ooh.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.246
You see, Aunt Peggy?

17:19.621 --> 17:22.291
I'm not the only one
who thinks mama can change.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.795
Oh, they grow up so fast.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.967
Why, you stupid, fat,
stupid, ugly son of a...

17:32.092 --> 17:33.135
- Whew.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.512
This is unbelievable!

17:35.679 --> 17:38.807
- Every time I find somebody like you...

17:38.932 --> 17:40.225
- ...you fall...

17:40.309 --> 17:41.435
Oh, ah.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.353
Hey... Hey, hey fellas.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.730
What happened to your eye?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.690
Eye? Oh, eye! Oh, that.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.567
That... That's an interesting story.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.568
You know what?

17:49.693 --> 17:51.487
I was walking... I was walking

17:51.612 --> 17:54.281
and I walked into a door!

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742
Wait a minute.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.952
How is that interesting?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.333
I'm hungry.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.751
Where's the bride-to-be?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.628
- Oh, she'll be out soon.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.923
She just has the pre-engagement
party jitters.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.634
Some kind of damn jitters.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.553
Well, hi, everybody.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.347
Welcome to the party.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.516
Hey! Here she is.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.185
Whoo! Let's get it on!

18:23.519 --> 18:24.686
Oh, no!

18:24.770 --> 18:25.938
What should we do?

18:26.480 --> 18:31.026
Well, I am going to go
close up the mustard before it crusts.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.653
If you'll excuse me.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.911
Okay, if she gets out of hand,
I'll go high, you guys go low.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.496
I'm ready for her.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.539
Pepper spray.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.290
50 percent capsaicin.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.085
Mama, maybe you should eat something.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.462
Well, where's the darn food?

18:50.754 --> 18:53.632
Did fungus-for-brains
already gobble it all up?

18:53.757 --> 18:55.676
Gobble it up. Yeah.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.266
Hey, boys, she's back.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.519
Give it up for Le-le! Whoo!

19:05.519 --> 19:06.520
Poor Bill.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.480
His woman is making a fool of him.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.357
It happens.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.152
Mama, please!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.903
Will you quit calling me that?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.947
I'm only 34.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.908
Whoo! Look at these!

19:20.033 --> 19:21.326
- Ah.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.871
Hello, righty, hello lefty.

19:23.996 --> 19:24.997
Say hi, everybody.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.456
I want to go home.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.583
Thank God.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.252
Hey.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.463
Well, come on, stud.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.132
Show me some love!

19:35.465 --> 19:38.218
Help! Get this skank off me!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.515
Fork!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.225
You pimply little...

19:47.561 --> 19:51.023
Excuse me, ma'am,
but that was my fork.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.233
Poor Peggy. She's dead.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.444
Leanne, whether you like the title or not

19:55.444 --> 19:56.945
you are this girl's mother.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.948
She has been waiting her whole life
for just a shred of attention from you.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.658
But you don't know how to return

20:01.742 --> 20:02.993
even a fraction of the love

20:02.993 --> 20:04.369
that you get from your child

20:04.453 --> 20:05.746
or from your man.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.373
I hope someday you can
live without alcohol.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.960
But until that day, we can all
live very nicely without you.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.674
Peggy, thank you for that.

20:17.966 --> 20:18.967
I'm sorry.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.388
I've been acting pretty foolish, everyone.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.682
You can let go of my hand.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.733
- Hank, get her off me! Hank!

20:35.442 --> 20:37.611
- Aah!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.699
Hank.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.077
I kicked your brother's ass

20:45.077 --> 20:47.329
and I will kick yours, too, sissy!

20:47.329 --> 20:49.915
Oh! Well, there is one thing
that you didn't count on.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.292
My brother has got size six feet

20:52.751 --> 20:53.877
but I don't!

20:53.961 --> 20:55.963
Oh, yeah!

20:59.925 --> 21:01.385
Kill that skank.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.220
- Kicked her ass.
- Go, Peggy.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.471
Come on, Luanne.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.973
Let's get out of this dump.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.100
Mm-mm.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.395
Oh, think you're better than me, huh?

21:12.354 --> 21:15.357
Fine! Then I ain't your sister no more!

21:15.816 --> 21:17.651
Aw!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.500
Well, I guess we can start eating.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.961
You can't just let her
steal your truck, Bill.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.337
You got to call the police.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.257
No, I think the best thing
to do is just let her go.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.844
If she doesn't come back
it means we were never meant to be.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.431
And if she does come back, well...

21:47.597 --> 21:49.016
Then I'll call the police.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.143
<i>You kicked her ass, mom.</i>

21:51.143 --> 21:52.060
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:53.353
<i>But she's a better dancer.</i>

21:53.437 --> 21:54.396
<i>You do not know that.</i>

21:57.441 --> 21:59.359
What should I do
about Mr. Dauterive?

21:59.443 --> 22:01.653
He keeps introducing me as his daughter.

22:02.279 --> 22:06.158
Well, the parental bond is extremely
strong, even if it's not real.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.786
You know, the aunt-niece bond
is even stronger.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.496
I think so, too.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.292
Twin sisters may have the strongest bond.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.419
Especially if they're
attached at the head.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.378
Mm-hmm.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.672
And next would be the aunt-niece bond.

22:20.756 --> 22:25.093
Oh, yeah. Strongest is
the aunt-niece attached at the head.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.803
Well, I don't know how that would happen.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.389
<i>But yes, that would be very, very strong.</i>
