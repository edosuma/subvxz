01:02.209 --> 01:04.939
<i>All my life,
I always wanted to fly.</i>

01:06.045 --> 01:08.674
<i>I always wanted
to live like a hawk.</i>

01:10.084 --> 01:13.645
<i>I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...</i>

01:13.721 --> 01:15.689
<i>to take flight,</i>

01:15.757 --> 01:19.090
<i>to soar above
everything and everyone,</i>

01:20.462 --> 01:22.555
<i>now that's living.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:43.483
So, we'll burn
15 seconds off the clock,

01:43.554 --> 01:45.681
and we'll end this thing
our way in his house.

01:45.756 --> 01:48.817
We stack it up. I want Odin, Michael
and Billy to handle the ball.

01:48.893 --> 01:50.951
Hugo, you and Todd
set up the screens.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.021
At 13 seconds, we run
the Tulsa play for Odin. Give me that.

01:54.097 --> 01:57.261
Todd, you're in the stack
with Michael. Hugo? Hugo!

01:57.335 --> 02:00.702
You're at the right elbow. Billy, you're
at the low block on the weak side.

02:00.772 --> 02:04.174
And remember, lads.
Hugo and Todd are decoys.

02:04.243 --> 02:07.644
Decoys! I don't want to see either
one of those guys with the ball.

02:07.746 --> 02:11.147
At 13 seconds, we free up Odin
for the one on one, then clear!

02:11.217 --> 02:13.550
If it's not Odin, Michael.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.986
Put them in.
What time is it, team?

02:16.056 --> 02:17.045
Game time! Rah!

02:17.157 --> 02:18.385
All right, let's focus!

02:33.040 --> 02:34.200
Move, move!

02:36.077 --> 02:38.478
Good passes.
I want good passes!

02:40.015 --> 02:41.312
Keep it tight.

02:44.152 --> 02:45.449
Tight!

02:49.358 --> 02:51.486
Go, go, go!

02:51.561 --> 02:53.051
Take the ball!

02:56.099 --> 02:58.796
- Tulsa!
- Tulsa!

03:02.640 --> 03:04.232
Don't stop! Don't stop!

03:04.308 --> 03:05.741
Don't stop!

03:05.809 --> 03:09.472
Eight, seven, six, five,

03:09.473 --> 03:13.136
four, three, two, one!

03:14.119 --> 03:16.781
Yes! Yes! Yes!

04:24.762 --> 04:28.323
<i>Coach Duke Goulding!</i>

04:30.302 --> 04:32.793
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

04:32.871 --> 04:34.771
Thank you very much.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.501
All right.

04:36.575 --> 04:38.475
Odin, would you
come down here, please?

04:38.543 --> 04:41.103
As you all know,
I am a man of few words.

04:41.179 --> 04:43.978
Except for when one of us
is late for practice, right, Pop?

04:44.050 --> 04:46.279
I'll pretend I don't know
who said that, Hugo.

04:46.351 --> 04:47.841
I'll get right to the point.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.787
By virtue of having won
our divisional championship,

04:50.857 --> 04:53.223
as well as having the best
record in the league,

04:53.292 --> 04:56.592
we will have home court advantage
in the State Championship,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.791
all the way up to, and
including, the semi-finals.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.634
And one reason for that is
this young man standing next to me.

05:04.706 --> 05:06.570
And I'll tell you
something else too-

05:08.041 --> 05:10.510
and I'm very proud
to say this publicly.

05:11.646 --> 05:14.274
I love him
like my own son.

05:19.020 --> 05:21.251
Not only is he a shoe-in

05:21.323 --> 05:23.951
for this year's USA Today
high school All American,

05:24.026 --> 05:26.757
but he is going
to lead this team

05:26.830 --> 05:29.197
to the 20th State Championship

05:29.447 --> 05:34.327
in the 115 year
history of this institution!

05:37.607 --> 05:39.235
You can stay on your feet,

05:39.310 --> 05:42.507
'cause at this time,
I am very proud to present

05:42.580 --> 05:44.810
this year's
unanimous choice

05:45.082 --> 05:48.501
for most valuable player
to Mr. Odin James.

05:49.130 --> 05:50.174
Congratulations.

05:56.128 --> 05:58.119
You know, at the beginning
of the season,

05:58.197 --> 06:00.358
we decided
to go all the way.

06:00.432 --> 06:02.798
And I did give it
all I had,

06:02.901 --> 06:07.168
but that wouldn't have meant nothing
if I didn't have a go-to guy.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.868
Big Mike,
come up here, man.

06:09.943 --> 06:14.107
Come on, now's not
the time to be shy. Come on.

06:15.748 --> 06:19.377
I told the coach
I wasn't accepting the MVP award

06:19.452 --> 06:22.980
unless the "man with the
hands" could share it with me.

06:23.057 --> 06:24.719
That's for you, baby.

06:25.694 --> 06:27.752
It's all you, baby.

07:24.523 --> 07:26.013
I don't understand.

07:26.092 --> 07:29.118
Are you going to get
Desi and I together?

07:29.195 --> 07:32.221
- She's with him.
- They're breaking up.

07:32.299 --> 07:35.757
When people are breaking up,
they don't grind.

07:35.835 --> 07:37.497
Those two
are definitely grinding.

07:37.572 --> 07:38.971
We're going to break them up.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.504
I thought
you were his friend.

07:42.611 --> 07:44.578
You hang out
with him all the time.

07:44.645 --> 07:46.511
And that's perfect,
'cause if we're going to do this,

07:46.581 --> 07:48.812
I've got to act like
I'm cool with him anyway.

07:48.884 --> 07:52.342
Look, you know
what a utility man is?

07:52.421 --> 07:53.649
A what?

07:54.723 --> 07:56.850
I'm considered
a utility man.

07:56.925 --> 08:00.555
I rebound, I can shoot.
I play guard, forward, power forward.

08:00.630 --> 08:02.894
You name the position,
I fucking play it.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.664
- What's your point?
- The point is,

08:06.736 --> 08:09.103
I'm the MVP
on this piece of shit team.

08:09.173 --> 08:12.573
I've been banging in the paint and
setting screens for the past four years,

08:12.643 --> 08:16.010
and he chooses Michael.
Fucking sophomore! No way!

08:19.116 --> 08:20.606
Look at this shit.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.582
- Roger, don't wuss out on me now.
- He'll boot me out of school.

08:28.661 --> 08:32.255
We are two blocks away from
the Roger Calhoon Senior Library.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.663
Your father is
this fucking institution.

08:34.734 --> 08:36.463
Do you want Desi or not?

08:48.615 --> 08:52.176
- Yes?
- Uh, hi. Dean Brable?

08:52.285 --> 08:53.843
Yes. Who is this?

08:53.955 --> 08:56.081
I don't know
how to tell you this, sir,

08:56.156 --> 08:58.785
but someone sort of stole
something from you.

08:58.860 --> 09:01.055
What are you talking about?

09:01.095 --> 09:02.392
Your daughter.

09:02.463 --> 09:05.432
What about my daughter?

09:05.501 --> 09:08.334
We're going to run them until
they drop dead or we drop dead!

09:08.404 --> 09:10.633
And that means
pressing on defense too.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.606
And by the way,
my friend, Hugo,

09:12.675 --> 09:14.506
your ass was dragging
in the fourth quarter.

09:14.576 --> 09:16.567
Either you get back
to your position on the traps,

09:16.645 --> 09:19.809
- or you give me some reason why.
- I'll be all right.

09:19.883 --> 09:22.579
You got to be better
than all right, son!

09:22.686 --> 09:24.779
Everybody
look at me, not him!

09:24.888 --> 09:27.652
This goes for you!
On your feet, gentlemen.

09:27.724 --> 09:30.022
Good afternoon, Dean.
You're welcome here.

09:30.093 --> 09:32.528
Good afternoon.

09:32.596 --> 09:35.394
And I have a witness who says
he forced himself on her.

09:35.465 --> 09:37.627
What? Who?

09:37.702 --> 09:42.470
Look, if Desi says that I did anything
even close to wrong to her,

09:42.541 --> 09:45.271
- I'll leave the goddamn school. OK?
- Take it easy, son.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.402
Bob, that's a very
serious allegation.

09:47.479 --> 09:50.642
- You say you have a witness?
- Come on, there's no witness.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.048
I would never do anything
like that. Ever.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.780
You're telling me you never
had any run-ins with the police?

09:55.888 --> 09:58.254
No, it means I didn't
force myself on Desi.

09:58.324 --> 10:00.849
That's not
what I just asked you.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.122
What are you trying to say?

10:03.197 --> 10:04.833
- You know what I'm saying.
- You're saying I'm not clean?

10:04.834 --> 10:06.359
Is that what you're sayin'?

10:06.432 --> 10:07.990
Cause I'm not
on that shit no more.

10:08.068 --> 10:09.467
Come on, coach,
you know this.

10:09.536 --> 10:12.061
I mean, test my ass.
Test me.

10:12.139 --> 10:14.198
This is fucked up.
This is fucked up.

10:14.274 --> 10:18.041
And a lot of the things I hear you say
about Desi are fucked up.

10:18.113 --> 10:20.171
- Bob.
- Don't underestimate me, son.

10:20.247 --> 10:22.876
Don't underestimate me
when it comes to my daughter.

10:22.951 --> 10:26.717
Hey, Bob! Please, please!
Back off! Now, come on. Please.

10:26.788 --> 10:28.120
If you were
so worried about me,

10:28.224 --> 10:30.616
how come this school
busted its ass to get me here?

10:30.617 --> 10:31.931
Because you were worth it!

10:32.962 --> 10:33.929
Yes?

10:33.996 --> 10:35.965
Come in, sweetheart.

10:36.065 --> 10:38.124
Please,
sit down over here.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.827
D, you've got to tell
these guys what's going on.

10:39.902 --> 10:43.394
- We know what's going on.
- We've got to be reasonable.

10:43.473 --> 10:44.371
Now, come on.

10:45.842 --> 10:47.139
Honey...

10:49.679 --> 10:52.477
we've never had
any secrets before, right?

10:52.549 --> 10:55.279
I just want you
to tell me the truth.

10:55.353 --> 10:57.651
Did Odin ever harm you,

10:57.722 --> 11:02.250
force you to do anything
that you didn't want to do?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.850
Anything at all?

11:06.298 --> 11:09.461
Odin and I have been
together for four months.

11:09.535 --> 11:13.403
"Together"?
What does that mean, "together"?

11:13.472 --> 11:15.064
Dad, that's none
of your business.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.371
I asked you a question.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.673
And I said
it's none of your business.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.698
Listen, Bob,
this is a family matter.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.431
Maybe we shouldn't be
discussing it here.

11:43.505 --> 11:46.338
I mean, he's a good kid.
Don't do this.

11:50.546 --> 11:51.911
Talk to him.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.949
Let's give him
a chance to talk.

11:54.016 --> 11:55.608
Outside.

12:01.859 --> 12:07.593
Sir, I just want to tell you that
you've got a great daughter there.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.969
And I really,
really care about her.

12:12.036 --> 12:17.167
You've got to understand
that what we have is beautiful.

12:19.879 --> 12:22.745
No. She deceived me.

12:24.149 --> 12:26.673
What makes you think
she won't do the same to you?

12:31.824 --> 12:35.283
If you ever lie on me again, I'll fuck
your punk ass up a lot worse than this.

12:35.362 --> 12:37.922
You understand me, Rog? Huh?

12:42.769 --> 12:44.236
See you at dinner.

13:14.637 --> 13:17.765
You're going to keep doing
this shit all year, yo?

13:17.874 --> 13:20.207
You tell me, man.
You're the pharmacist.

13:22.145 --> 13:26.674
You know, some of these drugs I sell
will guarantee to have you twisted up.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.550
This steroid,
50-50 chance.

13:30.621 --> 13:32.487
I put three inches
on my vertical this month.

13:32.556 --> 13:35.082
I took half a second
off my 40, bro'.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.421
It's doing the job.

13:37.495 --> 13:41.022
When you start playing for North
Carolina, don't forget about me.

13:41.099 --> 13:42.965
Shoot the nigger
some tickets.

13:43.035 --> 13:45.025
I'm talking about court side.

13:55.548 --> 13:58.108
We're going to cycle you
to something else next week.

13:58.184 --> 13:59.948
You've been drinking
enough water?

14:00.020 --> 14:02.250
By the gallon, man.

14:02.322 --> 14:06.349
I'm surprised it doesn't come out
these holes you keep sticking in me.

14:06.427 --> 14:09.486
<i>I know you're all into
this basketball stuff,</i>

14:09.563 --> 14:12.089
<i>but if it don't work,
don't trip.</i>

14:12.166 --> 14:15.567
I'm saying cause there's some things
in life we weren't meant to have.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.663
I mean, don't go out there making
yourself all crazy and shit.

14:18.740 --> 14:22.574
How can I go crazy when I've got
you selling me dream in a bottle, man?

14:26.081 --> 14:27.549
<i>So, have you talked
to him about it?</i>

14:27.650 --> 14:29.514
There's nothing to talk about.

14:29.585 --> 14:31.577
I do everything for him,

14:31.687 --> 14:34.417
<i>but he's been acting
completely weird lately.</i>

14:34.490 --> 14:36.516
<i>Lately? Try always.</i>

14:36.593 --> 14:38.562
<i>Sorry.</i>

14:38.628 --> 14:40.324
What's the deal?

14:40.397 --> 14:43.059
Everyone at school
likes Hugo, except you.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.623
<i>Nobody doesn't like him.</i>

14:44.702 --> 14:47.227
I don't trust anyone who doesn't
have at least one enemy.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.101
<i>Well, I guess he does.</i>

14:49.173 --> 14:50.573
<i>I didn't think
you were going to make it.</i>

14:50.641 --> 14:52.166
Oh, come on now.

14:53.378 --> 14:55.368
You know I can't beat
Magnolia tomorrow

14:55.480 --> 14:57.607
without seeing
my good luck charm first.

14:57.716 --> 15:00.116
- What's up, Em?
- Hey.

15:00.185 --> 15:02.153
Hey, I've got
something for you.

15:12.131 --> 15:13.689
It's over 100 years old.

15:13.766 --> 15:16.327
It's over your price
range is what it is.

15:16.403 --> 15:20.567
It was my great-grandmother's and
it's always been in my family.

15:20.641 --> 15:23.542
It's supposed
to stay that way, but...

15:23.610 --> 15:26.010
I feel like
we're already family.

15:27.081 --> 15:29.107
Yo, Em, don't think
I forgot you.

15:29.217 --> 15:31.048
I got the new Harlem's
Finest for you, baby.

15:31.152 --> 15:32.983
Enjoy that, all right?

15:53.009 --> 15:55.034
Come on, Emily's here.

15:55.111 --> 15:58.047
I know.
We're not going to do anything.

15:58.115 --> 16:01.312
I just like feeling
your skin next to mine, okay?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.011
Come on.

16:13.498 --> 16:18.903
My father's a smart man. But he's
never actually been through anything.

16:21.941 --> 16:26.070
He acts like he's in control all
the time, but really he's just scared.

16:26.145 --> 16:28.205
You never seem scared to me.

16:28.281 --> 16:31.079
Are you asking me how
I got that scar on my back?

16:32.152 --> 16:34.177
You do have
the best stories.

16:36.356 --> 16:39.326
I was a C-section baby
and they cut too far.

16:39.426 --> 16:42.953
My mom couldn't afford
a good doctor.

16:44.565 --> 16:45.998
Are you serious?

16:46.067 --> 16:48.160
I fell off my skateboard.

16:49.537 --> 16:51.472
Are you crazy?
I get scared all the time.

16:51.539 --> 16:53.064
- You do not.
- Yes, I do.

16:53.141 --> 16:54.073
When?

16:55.277 --> 16:57.075
When?

16:57.145 --> 16:58.772
Okay.

16:58.847 --> 17:01.544
The first time
I tried to talk to you,

17:01.617 --> 17:04.210
I thought I was going
to faint, or something.

17:04.287 --> 17:05.481
That's not true.

17:05.555 --> 17:08.286
The second sentence out of your mouth
was, "Do you still have a boyfriend?"

17:08.391 --> 17:10.052
I said I was scared.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.458
I never said I couldn't
handle the pressure.

17:12.529 --> 17:15.225
You know I've got
them player skills.

17:15.299 --> 17:17.733
Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen
he's getting a little cocky.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.827
Don't say "Iittle" and "cocky" in
the same sentence when it comes to me.

17:20.905 --> 17:23.339
Especially
when you know the deal.

17:23.407 --> 17:24.875
Shut up!

17:26.544 --> 17:29.911
No, but you really
think I'm too cocky?

17:29.981 --> 17:32.074
No, it's okay.
You should be.

17:32.150 --> 17:35.244
- You pulled me, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.515
Yes, indeed, I did.

17:38.856 --> 17:40.449
I don't know how,
but you did it.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.187
What do you mean,
you don't know how?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.558
I pulled you 'cause
I'm that kind of nigger.

17:45.965 --> 17:49.402
Uh-oh. Don't be
acting like that.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.835
See, I can say "nigger"
cause I am a nigger.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.669
You can't 'cause you ain't.
Don't be jealous.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.904
And why can't I say it?
My people invented the word.

17:57.978 --> 17:59.445
You can't even think it.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.105
You're the one
who started it.

18:01.182 --> 18:03.377
You said I was so fine
you'd let me dress you up

18:03.451 --> 18:05.977
and play Black Buck
Got Loose in the Big House.

18:06.054 --> 18:07.520
Don't go repeating
that, all right?

18:07.589 --> 18:09.818
If another Black person
knew I said that,

18:09.890 --> 18:11.825
I could get my
suffering-Negro- league card revoked.

18:16.798 --> 18:21.065
Then you'd better watch out, because
I've got some dirt on you, player.

18:21.137 --> 18:23.195
Got some dirt on me, huh?

18:23.306 --> 18:24.898
You better not
let that leak.

18:26.509 --> 18:30.741
<i>And now, your year 2000...</i>

18:30.813 --> 18:36.047
<i>low country preparatory
league champion,</i>

18:36.120 --> 18:42.117
<i>Palmetto Grove Hawks!</i>

20:01.579 --> 20:02.705
Push! Push!

20:24.371 --> 20:26.235
Shit.

20:27.808 --> 20:29.400
<i>Injured on the floor.</i>

20:29.510 --> 20:33.446
<i>Palmetto Grove's
number four, Odin James.</i>

20:42.290 --> 20:44.622
- Is he okay?
- They're doing a CAT scan right now,

20:44.692 --> 20:47.388
so we'll see.
Don't worry.

20:47.462 --> 20:49.157
Edmund, did you bring
the insurance card?

20:49.230 --> 20:50.755
- I've got the card.
- So we're covered?

20:53.536 --> 20:56.596
Mickey gets more kisses
from my girl than I do.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.197
Could you stop being
a sarcastic asshole just once?

20:59.275 --> 21:03.006
I was joking,
all right? Relax.

21:03.113 --> 21:05.843
What's the deal?
I'm gone for a couple of hours

21:05.949 --> 21:07.473
and you're already
taking my girl, Big Mike?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.650
- What's up, dude?
- You get right home and get some rest.

21:12.722 --> 21:14.987
I will, man.
What's up, baby?

21:18.062 --> 21:19.654
I was worried about you.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.561
You were the one
who got hurt, stupid.

21:21.632 --> 21:23.601
No, you don't understand.

21:23.668 --> 21:25.761
I was worried that
if I hurt myself,

21:25.838 --> 21:28.271
who was going to take care
of you over there at Duke?

21:28.340 --> 21:29.864
Oh, right, right.

21:29.942 --> 21:31.910
You're still going to play
"Big House" with me, though, right?

21:31.978 --> 21:34.446
Hey, stop it with that.

21:34.514 --> 21:37.005
Then you better
stop getting hurt.

21:37.115 --> 21:40.016
- I love you.
- I love you too.

21:40.086 --> 21:43.055
You kids need to get back
to the dorms. Let's go, Hugo.

21:43.122 --> 21:45.181
I'm going to give
a shout at the boys, all right?

21:45.259 --> 21:46.953
- Mike.
- Hey, man.

21:47.026 --> 21:49.996
- We did our thing today, bro'.
- Yeah, we did good.

21:51.332 --> 21:53.300
What's up, Em?
How are you doing?

21:53.367 --> 21:54.925
Hugo.

21:55.003 --> 21:57.527
Thought we lost you
there for a second, bro.

21:57.605 --> 22:00.268
I ain't going nowhere.
But did we take it to them or what?

22:00.342 --> 22:03.106
You took it to them by yourself.
You know that, player.

22:03.178 --> 22:05.043
You're coming to
that party off campus?

22:05.114 --> 22:07.513
Yeah, I need to get a ride
with my dad, though.

22:07.582 --> 22:09.574
All right, man.
Don't take too long.

22:09.684 --> 22:10.981
Later, Hugo.

22:13.588 --> 22:15.853
Come on, don't worry.
He'll get there.

22:17.326 --> 22:19.420
Yeah, Roger.

22:19.495 --> 22:21.554
We've got
plans tonight, man.

22:32.175 --> 22:35.168
When I passed out,
I think I had a vision.

22:37.081 --> 22:41.575
Have you ever ridden on the handlebars
on one of your friends' bikes before?

22:41.687 --> 22:43.154
Yeah.

22:43.222 --> 22:46.658
Well, I used to ride on the bars
and try to close my eyes.

22:46.724 --> 22:48.852
I could never do it.

22:48.961 --> 22:50.326
It's some scary shit,
cause you've got...

22:50.396 --> 22:54.662
to try to trust
the other person not to crash.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.928
You're tripping me out
right now.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.562
I feel like I can
close my eyes with you.

23:01.641 --> 23:02.835
Look...

23:02.909 --> 23:05.673
we're 18,
and personally,

23:05.745 --> 23:10.376
I'm not trying to get married by some
Elvis impersonator in Vegas, but...

23:14.221 --> 23:16.815
I figured maybe we could pretend
for a while, you know?

23:23.532 --> 23:25.898
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.343
Oh, yeah!

23:36.412 --> 23:38.539
Now we're feeling good,
huh?

23:38.615 --> 23:40.412
Go get them, tiger.

23:40.483 --> 23:43.145
Now go out there and
you find that girl.

23:45.289 --> 23:47.222
- Time to pull some weeds.
- Just for the record,...

23:47.291 --> 23:49.020
why am I
doing this again?

23:49.127 --> 23:52.425
Because this is
how you get Desi's attention.

23:52.496 --> 23:54.522
Now get your honky
ass in gear.

23:57.168 --> 23:58.135
It's about team work.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.966
Hey.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.666
- Excuse us, Roger.
- Excuse you?

24:02.741 --> 24:04.141
We're talking.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.646
What, are you diagramming
some basketball plays?

24:07.712 --> 24:09.340
What did you say?

24:14.221 --> 24:17.418
I don't care if your father
owns the whole fucking school.

24:23.897 --> 24:26.388
Shit. Excuse me.

24:28.970 --> 24:32.029
Roger!
Take it easy, big guy.

24:32.106 --> 24:34.336
- Not so tough, now, are you?
- Hey, Rog!

24:34.409 --> 24:36.400
What are you talking about?
Stop it!

24:36.477 --> 24:38.639
Your shooting ability
isn't helping you now, is it?

24:38.714 --> 24:40.010
Take it easy, pal.

24:41.215 --> 24:43.275
Back it off.

24:43.352 --> 24:44.979
Stop it, man. Come on.

24:45.054 --> 24:46.078
That's enough.

24:46.904 --> 24:48.589
Oh my God, Roger.
You're bleeding.

24:49.658 --> 24:51.023
Shit.

24:55.665 --> 24:58.031
So, this lad loses
a pint of blood,

24:58.102 --> 25:00.695
and you guys have got nothing
to say for yourselves.

25:00.804 --> 25:03.171
It was an accident, Pop.

25:03.239 --> 25:05.435
Roger's been
starting crap all year.

25:05.509 --> 25:07.601
Who threw
the first punch, Michael?

25:09.780 --> 25:12.180
Hugo, did Michael
throw the first punch?

25:12.249 --> 25:14.342
Answer me,
yes or no?!

25:14.418 --> 25:18.355
Yeah, Dad. Michael threw the first
punch but it wasn't his fault.

25:18.423 --> 25:21.722
All right? He just had a few
too many beers. That's all.

25:21.793 --> 25:23.021
I didn't hear that.

25:24.464 --> 25:26.556
I did not hear that.
You understand?

25:32.205 --> 25:34.674
You have disgraced our team.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.801
You know the rules.

25:36.909 --> 25:39.242
You can attend practice.

25:39.313 --> 25:41.747
That's a privilege
that I give you.

25:41.815 --> 25:45.114
But you will not play
in at least two games.

25:45.185 --> 25:47.653
Then, we will see.

25:47.721 --> 25:50.247
You know what this is going
to cost us?

25:50.617 --> 25:52.345
This young man sitting here...

25:53.239 --> 25:56.745
called you up to share

25:56.887 --> 25:59.234
the Most Valuable Player Award,

26:00.306 --> 26:03.752
and you just shit
all over it.

26:04.840 --> 26:08.708
And you know, you're lucky
that this didn't happen on campus,

26:08.778 --> 26:11.576
because
your over-privileged ass...

26:11.647 --> 26:12.841
I know, sir.

26:14.785 --> 26:16.275
Get out of here.

26:18.188 --> 26:19.883
Get out of here,
all of you.

26:31.869 --> 26:35.498
Is there some reason you're
still in this office, son?

26:35.606 --> 26:36.835
No, Pop.

26:48.787 --> 26:51.154
You fucked us up, Dogs.

26:51.223 --> 26:53.385
Fucked up.

27:21.156 --> 27:25.093
If Odin had got into a fight,
would you have sat him too?

27:29.298 --> 27:31.631
I'm eating now.

27:46.618 --> 27:48.415
I'm going back
to the dorm, Mom.

27:51.623 --> 27:54.251
<i>So what did Roger
say to you anyway?</i>

27:54.325 --> 27:56.794
<i>I'd feel guilty
kicking his ass.</i>

27:56.861 --> 27:58.830
<i>Save it, Hugo.</i>

27:58.898 --> 28:01.332
<i>You'll be back on the team
next year. So, who cares?</i>

28:01.400 --> 28:04.631
Dude, it's different
for you, cause your dad is cool.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.864
But my parents
are going to find out.

28:09.575 --> 28:11.600
Why are you in school, man?

28:14.047 --> 28:15.207
What?

28:16.918 --> 28:19.409
Are you here for
your parents or for you?

28:21.155 --> 28:23.623
So they'll be a little pissed off.
What are they going to do?

28:23.691 --> 28:25.659
- Are they going to spank you?
- Hugo,

28:25.726 --> 28:29.093
my parents always talk
about reputation.

28:29.163 --> 28:32.530
Reputation?
Who gives a fuck about reputation?

28:32.600 --> 28:36.037
I love you, man, but you're
a little bit of a mamma's boy.

28:36.104 --> 28:39.096
The only person you have to
answer to is yourself.

28:39.174 --> 28:41.369
You make your own rules.

28:42.444 --> 28:44.913
The minute you figure
that out, you're free.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.876
Look, Mike,

28:51.956 --> 28:54.424
you really want
back on the team?

28:54.491 --> 28:56.982
Why can't you just talk
to your dad?

28:57.094 --> 29:01.190
Because I'm telling you,
my dad trusts Odin, all right?

29:01.265 --> 29:04.258
If Odin says we need you back in there,
you're back in there.

29:04.336 --> 29:07.169
Yeah, but Odin won't
even talk to me, man.

29:07.238 --> 29:08.465
Mike,

29:09.607 --> 29:11.131
am I your boy?

29:12.677 --> 29:14.406
Am I your boy?

29:14.946 --> 29:16.471
All right, then.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.346
This is what
we've got to do.

29:18.417 --> 29:20.544
You're friends
with Desi, right?

29:20.619 --> 29:21.779
Yes, of course.

29:21.854 --> 29:23.719
Well, now you're
her best friend.

29:23.824 --> 29:26.314
And you're going to get her
to talk to Odin for you.

29:26.425 --> 29:28.291
Pour your heart out to her.

29:28.362 --> 29:30.990
Girls are suckers for guys
who pour their hearts out.

29:31.064 --> 29:32.998
And then she talks to Odin.

29:33.066 --> 29:34.533
But listen to me.

29:34.601 --> 29:38.059
You've got to hang with her.
That's the only way this thing works.

29:38.138 --> 29:39.902
It's worth a shot, bro'.

29:42.943 --> 29:45.811
Yo. Hugo, thanks, man.

29:46.881 --> 29:48.610
<i>What are you doing
with this stupid bird?</i>

29:48.683 --> 29:51.118
<i>- People are looking for it.
- I borrowed it.</i>

29:51.186 --> 29:52.847
<i>We've got things to do,</i>

29:52.921 --> 29:54.979
<i>and you're playing pranks
with the fricking mascot?</i>

29:55.057 --> 29:57.151
<i>I can't stop
thinking about her.</i>

29:57.259 --> 29:59.989
Why don't you rich shitheads
ever have any patience?

30:00.095 --> 30:04.465
Anything worth anything
takes time and sacrifice.

30:04.534 --> 30:06.525
You spoiled fuck.

30:07.737 --> 30:09.227
What do you call this?

30:09.305 --> 30:11.170
You did get your ass kicked
pretty good, though.

30:11.241 --> 30:13.972
No, I got my ass
kicked pretty good twice,

30:14.045 --> 30:15.978
in less than a week!

30:16.047 --> 30:18.447
I need to know
where this is going!

30:18.515 --> 30:22.509
<i>Friends, this tournament
has seen some excellent play,</i>

30:22.586 --> 30:26.044
but nothing better than
Odin James of Palmetto Grove.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.592
<i>Tonight, James and his Hawks</i>

30:28.660 --> 30:31.458
<i>face the mighty Bulldogs
of North Charleston,</i>

30:31.563 --> 30:37.332
<i>in the first face-off between these
two hoops powerhouses in nine years.</i>

30:37.403 --> 30:40.770
<i>The Hawks, now an amazing ninth
in the nation in prep ball</i>

30:40.840 --> 30:44.799
<i>are just two games away
from the State Championship,</i>

30:44.877 --> 30:47.971
<i>but they'll have to do it
without their team mascot.</i>

30:48.047 --> 30:51.039
<i>Evidently,
the bird was stolen.</i>

30:51.117 --> 30:54.485
<i>So it looks like James will have
to do all the flying himself.</i>

30:56.825 --> 30:59.453
Watch the hands!
Watch the hands, ref!

30:59.527 --> 31:01.119
He's open!

31:01.195 --> 31:04.188
He's open, Hugo!
Give him the ball!

31:04.265 --> 31:06.130
Push, push, push!

31:16.278 --> 31:18.838
Pressure the ball!
Pressure the ball!

31:18.914 --> 31:20.678
Todd, get back!

31:25.655 --> 31:27.179
Todd,
stay with the ball!

31:31.228 --> 31:33.857
Put a body on him,
for Christ's sake!

31:35.866 --> 31:37.926
Play the man,
not the ball!

31:38.035 --> 31:39.797
Come on,
put a body on him!

31:39.904 --> 31:41.873
Come on,
he's slipping!

31:43.675 --> 31:45.040
Time!

31:45.109 --> 31:48.045
Come on, let's go.
We've only got 20!

31:51.049 --> 31:53.381
Lads, you're getting
into the wrong guy's face.

31:53.452 --> 31:55.546
Number 45 is taking us
to the cleaners.

31:55.621 --> 31:57.020
Every time he gets
the ball, he's freed up.

31:57.089 --> 32:01.493
It's an automatic deuce because nobody
is putting a body on him in the paint.

32:01.561 --> 32:04.428
So put a man to man
with a floater.

32:04.497 --> 32:06.966
Odin, you're the floater.
Billy, look at me!

32:07.033 --> 32:09.867
You deny that son of a bitch
the ball, understand?

32:09.970 --> 32:11.597
And Odin,
if he gets away from Billy,

32:11.705 --> 32:13.332
I don't give a shit if
you have to pull his pisser,

32:13.440 --> 32:15.806
his feet do not
leave the ground!

32:15.876 --> 32:17.503
Enough said?
All right, put them in.

32:17.578 --> 32:19.638
What time is it now?

32:19.714 --> 32:22.342
- Game time! Rah!
- All right, let's play!

32:22.417 --> 32:25.409
Odin, Hugo,
come on! Wake up!

32:25.487 --> 32:26.852
Let's finish this thing.

32:27.923 --> 32:31.087
Give me another board.
Come on, let's go! Get it up!

32:31.160 --> 32:34.357
- Watch it!
- Watch him, Odin!

32:36.532 --> 32:39.433
Push him!
Come on, help him out!

32:39.502 --> 32:42.904
Watch the perimeter.
There you go. Take the shot.

32:47.043 --> 32:48.272
Yes!

32:48.378 --> 32:50.812
Hugo, stay on the elbow.
Stay on the elbow.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.747
Pop through, Billy.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.318
Pick it up!

33:48.544 --> 33:52.640
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, man.

33:55.885 --> 33:57.910
You know,
I've been thinking, man.

33:58.021 --> 34:01.081
I think I'm going to talk
to coach about Mikey.

34:01.157 --> 34:04.024
He should be a part
of all this, man.

34:04.094 --> 34:05.288
Listen,

34:06.363 --> 34:09.025
did Mike know that you and Desi
were getting together?

34:10.100 --> 34:11.533
<i>Yeah, he knew.</i>

34:13.337 --> 34:14.463
<i>Why?</i>

34:16.474 --> 34:18.305
I didn't think he knew.

34:18.376 --> 34:21.743
<i>You know, Mikey's the one
that hooked us up, man.</i>

34:24.783 --> 34:26.217
Do you trust Mike?

34:30.122 --> 34:32.352
I trust him out there
on that court.

34:32.425 --> 34:34.393
The man
can play some ball.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.927
Yeah,
but do you trust him?

34:37.596 --> 34:39.063
Yeah, he's cool.

34:44.004 --> 34:46.802
What's up, man?
Why are you tripping?

34:46.874 --> 34:48.807
It's nothing, man.

34:48.876 --> 34:52.209
Come on, Hugo.
Say what you've got to say.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.942
You're not
a jealous person, man.

34:55.016 --> 34:57.314
I am.
It's a weakness.

34:57.419 --> 35:00.684
You know, sometimes I see things
that are not really there.

35:00.755 --> 35:02.848
<i>Yeah?</i>

35:07.830 --> 35:10.298
You don't want to hear
what I have to say.

35:10.366 --> 35:12.528
Let me be
the judge of that.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.103
I can't help
but think that...

35:22.412 --> 35:24.505
you should
watch your girl, bro'.

35:24.581 --> 35:28.279
<i>I mean, she and Mike spend
an awful lot of time together.</i>

35:28.352 --> 35:30.411
And so what?

35:30.521 --> 35:34.013
<i>All I'm saying is that
her and Mike are always together.</i>

35:34.125 --> 35:37.026
<i>And I know the Dean would rather
see Mike up in that piece.</i>

35:37.095 --> 35:39.188
How can you say some shit
like that to me, man?

35:39.264 --> 35:40.731
See, you're right.

35:40.799 --> 35:42.892
I shouldn't
have said nothing.

35:44.236 --> 35:45.864
Forget about it, man.

35:45.937 --> 35:47.700
Mike's a good guy.

35:51.477 --> 35:53.035
Wait, wait.

35:54.781 --> 35:58.115
No, man, you can't say some shit
like that and just break out.

35:58.185 --> 36:00.152
<i>What's going on, Dogs?</i>

36:03.891 --> 36:05.381
All right.

36:06.794 --> 36:12.699
You and Desi were going out for four
months before her father had a clue.

36:12.767 --> 36:16.100
So obviously, the girl knows
how to keep a secret.

36:16.171 --> 36:18.833
You grew up in the hood, and
you've seen plenty of hustlers,

36:18.907 --> 36:22.071
but the one thing I do know
better than you is white girls.

36:22.144 --> 36:23.667
And white girls are snaky.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.772
All right,
they're horny snakes.

36:26.849 --> 36:28.874
They act like
we're the ones who want sex,

36:28.951 --> 36:31.010
but they want it
worse than us, man.

36:31.086 --> 36:33.646
They're just subtle about
the way they go after it.

36:33.722 --> 36:36.190
Hey, man,
my girl's not like that.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.986
But just think about the way
she played her father

36:40.096 --> 36:42.065
when he found out
about you and her.

36:43.633 --> 36:45.602
What? Emily
said something to you?

36:45.703 --> 36:49.662
No, but she wouldn't,
because they stick together.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.972
<i>There is one way
to find out, though.</i>

36:53.044 --> 36:55.912
- Yeah, like ask Mike.
- No,

36:55.981 --> 36:58.312
because if there is
something going on-

36:59.383 --> 37:01.818
and I'm not saying that there
is something going on-

37:01.887 --> 37:04.981
but if there is
something going on,

37:05.057 --> 37:07.150
they're not just
going to come clean.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.319
<i>Watch her.</i>

37:09.394 --> 37:13.058
<i>If she keeps hanging out with Mike,
if she keeps talking about Mike,</i>

37:13.166 --> 37:15.657
<i>then we've got something
to think about.</i>

37:16.903 --> 37:18.735
We don't let on, bro'.

37:19.772 --> 37:21.934
We just watch.

38:22.608 --> 38:24.132
What's up, man?

38:27.413 --> 38:29.313
Hey, O,
what's that all about?

38:34.688 --> 38:36.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.821
I'm almost ready.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.151
Cool.

38:41.729 --> 38:43.390
Just cool?

38:43.464 --> 38:45.398
I've been planning
this night for a month.

38:45.466 --> 38:47.128
Do you know what I had
to do to get that car?

38:47.202 --> 38:48.396
Yeah, I know.

38:50.037 --> 38:52.972
- Do you have your pass?
- Uh-hmm.

38:55.077 --> 38:56.544
What's wrong with you?

39:00.148 --> 39:01.740
Hello?

39:01.817 --> 39:03.217
Hey, D...

39:04.287 --> 39:07.051
you never used to go out
with Mike, like-

39:07.123 --> 39:09.717
Iike before I got here or
anything like that, right?

39:09.792 --> 39:12.488
Michael? He's like my best
friend, except for Emily.

39:13.963 --> 39:15.989
But I thought
I was your best friend.

39:16.065 --> 39:20.127
Oh, does my baby feel like
he's got a little competition?

39:20.204 --> 39:23.731
Come on, stop playing around.
Come on, stop!

39:23.841 --> 39:25.309
Damn.

39:26.745 --> 39:29.008
Let's just go, okay?

39:33.351 --> 39:35.182
Did somebody
say something to you?

39:35.254 --> 39:37.187
No, let's just go.

39:52.339 --> 39:55.308
Look, just give me the money.
It's only 100 bucks.

39:57.277 --> 39:58.266
This is it, dude.

39:58.378 --> 39:59.606
<i>I'm tapped out.</i>

39:59.714 --> 40:01.476
Dad said
he won't send any more.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.575
Then you'll have
to use his credit card.

40:04.686 --> 40:07.450
- We need a cell phone.
- What?

40:07.522 --> 40:10.719
If this is going to work,
we have to keep in constant contact.

40:16.931 --> 40:18.229
Hey, guys.

40:20.869 --> 40:23.100
Hey, Roger,
could you do me a favor?

40:23.173 --> 40:25.539
- Sure.
- Get lost.

40:36.754 --> 40:38.745
I have something for you.

40:38.856 --> 40:41.051
You have things
for lots of guys.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.531
You're amazing.

40:51.937 --> 40:53.666
What are you going
to do with it?

40:54.740 --> 40:56.265
Nothing.

40:56.341 --> 41:00.574
I'm not going to keep it.
It's just a little prank.

41:00.646 --> 41:04.548
When it turns up missing,
she's going to go nuts.

41:06.853 --> 41:08.913
What would I do without you?

41:20.400 --> 41:23.336
All this time I've been
looking for romance,

41:23.404 --> 41:26.134
and all I had to do
was steal something.

41:27.976 --> 41:30.240
You didn't steal anything.

41:31.946 --> 41:34.814
You just borrowed it
for a little while.

41:36.786 --> 41:40.018
And if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to borrow you.

42:13.959 --> 42:17.190
I want you to be able
to do anything.

42:17.262 --> 42:20.459
I want you to do
what you want with me.

42:21.501 --> 42:23.059
Yeah?

42:24.804 --> 42:27.398
I want you to have me
however you want.

42:27.473 --> 42:31.410
I want to give myself
to you the way you want me.

42:32.580 --> 42:35.447
Don't hold back.

44:09.952 --> 44:11.352
Ow!

44:11.421 --> 44:13.820
Odin, stop!

44:13.890 --> 44:15.619
Stop!

44:16.893 --> 44:18.359
Stop!

44:20.096 --> 44:21.427
No!

46:16.924 --> 46:19.654
<i>...purposely uses
this maternal imagery</i>

46:19.726 --> 46:21.955
<i>to get him into
doing this dirty work.</i>

46:22.028 --> 46:26.363
"I have given suck and know how tender
it is to love the babe that milks me."

46:26.433 --> 46:32.031
Odin, did you give Desi
a scarf a while back?

46:32.107 --> 46:34.336
Yeah.

46:34.408 --> 46:36.274
It was
silk or something, right?

46:38.746 --> 46:40.475
Yeah,
I showed it to you.

46:40.583 --> 46:42.550
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

46:45.153 --> 46:48.419
Wait, you gave
that scarf to Desi?

46:48.491 --> 46:50.220
You know I did.

46:50.292 --> 46:52.453
You want me
to give that to her?

46:52.528 --> 46:54.462
Don't tell her it's from me.

46:54.530 --> 46:58.365
I think I saw Michael with
that same scarf about an hour ago.

46:58.434 --> 47:00.996
I'm not sure, but I'd swear
it was the same one.

47:01.071 --> 47:01.901
Thanks.

47:01.972 --> 47:03.363
Get the fuck out of here!

47:03.364 --> 47:04.755
<i>Mr. Goulding, Mr. James,</i>

47:04.975 --> 47:08.969
<i>would either of you care to name
one of Shakespeare's poems for me?</i>

47:10.148 --> 47:11.809
I thought he wrote movies.

47:11.916 --> 47:15.352
<i>Perhaps you two should pay attention.</i>

47:15.453 --> 47:18.820
That way, after you've won this
nationally televised championship,

47:18.891 --> 47:20.518
<i>you'll have something
more profound to say.</i>

47:20.592 --> 47:23.686
<i>What do you mean, rough?
He forced you?</i>

47:23.762 --> 47:25.287
<i>No, it wasn't like that.</i>

47:25.364 --> 47:27.423
<i>We were already doing it.</i>

47:27.499 --> 47:29.660
<i>Did you say "stop"?</i>

47:29.735 --> 47:31.704
He didn't rape me.

47:31.771 --> 47:35.605
Desi, you know
I like O too, okay?

47:35.675 --> 47:38.974
But you act like the guy's
a saint or something.

47:39.045 --> 47:40.774
<i>Well,
maybe he's not a saint,</i>

47:40.847 --> 47:43.976
<i>but he's never done anything
even close to that before.</i>

47:44.084 --> 47:46.018
Half the time, he doesn't
even want to do anything.

47:46.086 --> 47:47.986
He just lays naked with me.

47:48.055 --> 47:51.389
Desi, you said stop.

47:59.834 --> 48:03.134
Would you be so concerned
if he were white?

48:04.207 --> 48:06.140
That is so easy.

48:06.209 --> 48:09.201
<i>D, it's me.</i>

48:11.582 --> 48:13.549
What are you doing?
It's after hours.

48:13.616 --> 48:15.050
I know.

48:15.118 --> 48:17.347
I'm sorry.
I just had to see you.

48:19.856 --> 48:22.325
- To say how are you doing, Emily?
- Good.

48:22.426 --> 48:25.760
Sorry, baby, no presents
for you this time.

48:25.829 --> 48:28.060
Where were you?
Michael was looking for you.

48:29.734 --> 48:31.360
Mike?

48:31.435 --> 48:33.097
Yeah, Michael.

48:34.906 --> 48:36.931
Can I have a kiss?

48:42.948 --> 48:46.475
Hey, D, how come you never wear
that scarf I gave you?

48:46.552 --> 48:48.611
I hadn't really
thought about it.

48:48.688 --> 48:51.248
- Can I see it real quick?
- Yeah.

48:55.795 --> 48:57.626
I keep it right here.

48:58.832 --> 49:01.323
- What, you lost it?
- No, it's here somewhere.

49:01.401 --> 49:05.168
My mamma gave me that scarf
when she got real sick.

49:05.239 --> 49:08.333
She said to make sure to give it
to someone very special,

49:08.409 --> 49:10.343
and it'd keep
our love right.

49:10.411 --> 49:12.902
I'm sure it'll turn up
around here somewhere.

49:12.981 --> 49:16.041
- Could you look some more?
- She'll find it later.

49:16.117 --> 49:19.850
- Come on, I'll help you.
- No, I'll find it later.

49:19.922 --> 49:22.185
Right now, I really want
to talk about Michael.

49:22.257 --> 49:25.386
You know, he deserves to play,
and he's your best friend.

49:25.494 --> 49:29.090
- That's all he talks about.
- I really need you to find that scarf.

49:29.198 --> 49:31.166
And I said
I'll find it later.

49:31.267 --> 49:33.031
Hey, D...

49:34.204 --> 49:37.604
you'd never give out no love
behind my back, now would you?

49:37.674 --> 49:40.165
I mean, maybe
I'm not enough for you.

49:40.244 --> 49:44.409
You know, especially with you
being all hot and shit.

49:44.482 --> 49:45.779
What?

49:45.850 --> 49:47.817
You know
what I'm talking about.

49:47.885 --> 49:51.322
Hey, Em, you've got
to see this girl in action-

49:51.389 --> 49:53.755
Are you kidding me?!
That's really shitty!

49:53.825 --> 49:55.850
Okay.
But check this.

49:55.927 --> 49:58.020
If you were a virgin
like you said you were,

49:58.130 --> 50:00.529
how come when we're doing it
you're acting all freaky and stuff,

50:00.599 --> 50:03.090
telling me I could do
whatever I want with you?

50:03.202 --> 50:05.670
- I don't need to be here right now.
- No, Em.

50:05.738 --> 50:09.072
- I don't think you do either.
- That is not what I meant!

50:09.142 --> 50:12.372
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Look, let's just find the scarf, OK?

50:12.445 --> 50:15.438
- Emily's going to help us.
- What if Emily doesn't want to help?

50:15.515 --> 50:17.107
I think you should go.

50:17.184 --> 50:19.709
- Where is my scarf?
- I don't know.

50:19.787 --> 50:21.812
- You lost it.
- No, I'll find it later.

50:21.889 --> 50:24.915
Does Mike know where my scarf is?
Is that why you want me to talk to him?

50:24.992 --> 50:26.619
What?

50:26.694 --> 50:30.926
If you want to ask me if I'm cheating
on you, get some balls and ask.

50:31.032 --> 50:33.125
No, I'm not!
Michael?!

50:33.235 --> 50:37.171
You're the only person I've ever been
with and the only person want to be with.

50:37.239 --> 50:41.141
And if you want to be with me,
don't ever talk to me like that again, ever.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.810
I'm always
straight with you, O.

50:59.597 --> 51:02.692
<i>Two on one half break.
Let's go! Let's go!</i>

51:02.767 --> 51:04.497
<i>Push it!
Push it! Push it!</i>

51:07.205 --> 51:09.365
<i>Hugo!</i>

51:09.474 --> 51:12.237
For Christ's sake,
look where you are!

51:12.310 --> 51:15.211
Look where the basket is!
Protect the basket! For Christ's sake.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.840
It's two on one fast break!
What, are you deaf?

51:17.916 --> 51:21.374
Odin, where are you? At some picnic?
We've got 10 full minutes.

51:21.454 --> 51:24.116
Let's make it count!
Come on, stack it up!

51:24.190 --> 51:27.182
- Come on, man, stack it up!
- Let's go!

51:31.264 --> 51:33.426
Come on! Push it!

51:36.970 --> 51:38.632
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball!

51:38.739 --> 51:39.706
Damn it!

51:39.774 --> 51:42.902
You guys are lolly-gagging
the ball up and down the court

51:43.010 --> 51:44.739
Iike a bunch of snails.

51:44.812 --> 51:46.542
You play this way
come game night,

51:46.614 --> 51:49.879
you won't beat the Sisters of Mercy!
All right, Michael,

51:49.951 --> 51:51.646
come in here
and run the point.

51:51.719 --> 51:54.586
Odin, why don't you
take your nap on the bench?

51:54.656 --> 51:56.352
It's more comfortable there.
Let's go, Michael.

51:56.425 --> 51:58.824
I said let's go! Come on!
You've got eight minutes.

52:09.406 --> 52:11.397
What's your fucking
problem, man?

52:11.508 --> 52:14.807
You get back here, son,
and apologize! Odin!

52:15.980 --> 52:19.575
Odin! You get your ass back
here and apologize.

52:25.657 --> 52:27.453
Jeff, run the team.

52:37.470 --> 52:39.062
Hey, Pop.

52:39.137 --> 52:40.729
Have a seat.

52:51.184 --> 52:55.348
It's been a while since
you invited me in for dinner.

52:55.421 --> 52:57.549
<i>What is going on with Odin?</i>

53:06.134 --> 53:07.431
I don't know.

53:09.671 --> 53:12.663
I saw him in class today.
He seemed all right.

53:15.211 --> 53:17.805
By the way, I'm getting
an A in English again.

53:17.914 --> 53:20.644
<i>That's great, son.
Congratulations.</i>

53:20.750 --> 53:24.379
<i>You know I don't ever have
to worry about you, thank God.</i>

53:24.487 --> 53:28.686
<i>You've always done well and
you always will, but Odin's different.</i>

53:28.759 --> 53:30.989
<i>He's all alone here.</i>

53:31.061 --> 53:34.497
<i>There's not even another Black student
in this whole damn place.</i>

53:34.565 --> 53:36.692
<i>We're his family.</i>

53:36.767 --> 53:41.033
<i>I want you to keep an eye on him,
find out what's going on.</i>

53:42.340 --> 53:44.240
- Sure, Pop.
- All right...

53:44.309 --> 53:46.607
<i>'cause if he's
got a problem,</i>

53:46.678 --> 53:48.612
<i>we've got a problem.</i>

53:52.818 --> 53:54.513
All right, Dad.

53:59.325 --> 54:02.557
<i>You know, your mother just
doesn't understand us.</i>

54:14.642 --> 54:16.837
You stay here
and finish your supper.

54:46.243 --> 54:48.005
<i>The state finals
are a few days away,</i>

54:48.077 --> 54:50.204
<i>and Palmetto Grove comes in
as a heavy favorite.</i>

54:50.280 --> 54:53.306
<i>Coach Duke Goulding,
or The Duke, as he is called,</i>

54:53.384 --> 54:55.546
<i>has got to be even more
jittery than the players.</i>

54:55.620 --> 54:59.181
<i>A win right here could pave the way
for a position at the college level.</i>

54:59.289 --> 55:00.917
But first, you're about
to see something

55:01.026 --> 55:03.426
that might make the NBA's
finest a little bit nervous.

55:03.495 --> 55:05.360
<i>And that's why
all the scouts are here.</i>

55:05.430 --> 55:08.457
<i>It's the Southeast regional
high school slam dunk contest.</i>

55:08.534 --> 55:10.729
<i>And young legs
mean lots of air.</i>

55:22.649 --> 55:24.981
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?

55:26.385 --> 55:28.753
You got that for me?

55:28.822 --> 55:32.087
- This ain't your style, player.
- It ain't gonna be.

55:32.193 --> 55:34.388
I just ain't slept
in a couple of days.

55:34.494 --> 55:38.488
Why the fuck are you worried?
Give me the shit and get your ass on.

55:38.599 --> 55:40.191
Money's for customers.

55:40.268 --> 55:42.328
This is a one-time
thing, right?

55:59.856 --> 56:02.985
You're going to have
to get in line, I'm afraid.

56:03.059 --> 56:06.086
Every conference in the country's
been after this kid,

56:06.196 --> 56:09.632
including the ACC,
the Big Twelve, Pac Ten, Big Ten.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.224
I hope you don't think
you're sitting there.

56:11.335 --> 56:14.270
- Bye. Good seeing you.
- I had this seat with Hugo.

56:14.339 --> 56:19.140
Well, Hugo's not here,
and I'm telling you to get lost.

56:19.211 --> 56:23.272
- Later, Roger, as in peace.
- Jason, stop. Leave him alone.

56:23.348 --> 56:24.781
Michael, come on.

56:24.850 --> 56:26.283
Go ahead and
keep sitting there.

56:26.352 --> 56:29.684
- Maybe I won't kick your ass again.
- It's okay, Roger.

56:29.755 --> 56:31.120
You can sit there.
It's fine.

56:31.189 --> 56:33.784
- Faggot. Tag along, faggot.
- Jason!

56:33.860 --> 56:35.850
<i>Why don't you go sit
with some other friends.</i>

56:35.928 --> 56:38.226
<i>Oh, you don't have any.
Everybody hates you.</i>

56:38.331 --> 56:41.596
Stupid tag-along.
Get lost.

56:41.702 --> 56:43.363
Flea.

56:43.469 --> 56:46.371
- Fucking faggot.
- Fuck off.

56:47.407 --> 56:51.537
- Loser. Fucking loser.
- Get out of here, Roger.

56:52.914 --> 56:56.281
It hurts, doesn't it?
Then get lost.

57:15.437 --> 57:18.634
You've got five minutes, man.
What's going on?

57:18.707 --> 57:20.971
You really
fucked me up, man.

57:21.044 --> 57:23.444
- Me?
- Yeah, you, bitch!

57:23.513 --> 57:29.316
If I knew Desi was going behind
my back, I could deal with that.

57:29.387 --> 57:32.845
But all this wondering you got me
going through is bullshit!

57:32.924 --> 57:34.755
You can't be thinking
about that now.

57:37.863 --> 57:40.423
I'm going to tell you
like this, Hugo.

57:40.499 --> 57:46.301
You better hope and pray you can
prove that Mike is fucking Desi.

57:46.405 --> 57:48.430
You understand me?!

57:53.278 --> 57:56.179
I try to help my friend
and this is what I get?

57:56.249 --> 57:58.774
Why don't you just
fucking forget about it, man?

57:58.852 --> 58:01.320
I mean,
you fucking got everything.

58:01.387 --> 58:04.619
I would give my left nut
to be in your shoes.

58:08.162 --> 58:09.823
Fuck Desi!

58:09.898 --> 58:13.697
She's not some gold medal you need
to win! You're the fucking medal, man!

58:13.767 --> 58:16.497
From the first time I saw her-

58:18.640 --> 58:22.304
the only reason I ever wanted
to do something big

58:23.411 --> 58:27.348
was so she'd be proud
to stand next to me.

58:28.618 --> 58:30.245
Shit.

58:31.354 --> 58:34.152
Look, is she cheating on me
or not?! What the fuck?

58:34.223 --> 58:36.192
Let's talk about this
after you win this thing.

58:36.259 --> 58:40.219
Don't you hold back
on me, Hugo. Not now.

58:40.297 --> 58:42.527
- Come on.
- No, you come on, bitch!

58:44.735 --> 58:48.364
- What, are you going to hit me?
- I will if you don't speak to me.

58:48.438 --> 58:52.534
I don't know if it's true, but he told
me they were together last night

58:52.644 --> 58:56.046
- and I don't know what else.
- God damn it.

58:56.114 --> 58:58.105
That's all
I'm saying for now.

58:58.217 --> 59:00.685
We can get together tonight
and talk about this.

59:05.357 --> 59:07.326
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

59:07.393 --> 59:08.691
What's that?

59:10.130 --> 59:12.461
I said they don't know
who they're fucking with.

59:14.601 --> 59:16.865
<i>They don't know
who they're fucking with!</i>

59:32.820 --> 59:34.254
Better hurry up, son.
You're late.

59:34.323 --> 59:35.813
Knock them dead.

59:57.880 --> 1:00:00.247
- Odin James.
- Okay,

1:00:00.351 --> 1:00:03.320
highest score is 50.
You get one minute to do three dunks.

1:00:03.420 --> 1:00:04.978
I'm only doing one.

1:00:05.089 --> 1:00:07.649
- What?
- I'm only doing one.

1:00:07.726 --> 1:00:09.489
<i>But you get
to throw out the two lowest.</i>

1:00:09.561 --> 1:00:12.620
<i>And now, our very own Odin James.</i>

1:00:17.769 --> 1:00:21.399
Grab your jockstraps, gentlemen.
He's about to blow you away.

1:00:58.714 --> 1:01:00.739
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

1:01:15.633 --> 1:01:16.894
Wow, he dunked it!

1:01:18.101 --> 1:01:20.569
I didn't think
he could do that anymore.

1:01:31.016 --> 1:01:33.177
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

1:01:49.602 --> 1:01:51.161
Yo, man,
that dunk was all that,

1:01:51.237 --> 1:01:53.068
- but I need the ball back, kid.
- What?

1:01:53.139 --> 1:01:56.598
- The ball, homey. Give it up.
- This ball right here, shorty?

1:01:56.677 --> 1:01:58.941
No, nigger, the balls
hanging under your dick.

1:01:59.012 --> 1:02:00.639
Watch your fucking mouth.
Who are you talking to?

1:03:02.114 --> 1:03:05.516
I'm just asking
for one last game, Bob.

1:03:05.584 --> 1:03:07.985
One game for whom?
For you...

1:03:08.054 --> 1:03:09.817
or for him?

1:03:09.889 --> 1:03:13.518
Because he's lucky
he's not suspended.

1:03:13.593 --> 1:03:17.325
Yeah, Dad,
who's your favorite now?

1:03:29.477 --> 1:03:31.672
I'm going
to take care of you, man.

1:03:33.849 --> 1:03:39.048
This shit right here...
will help you make it through.

1:03:43.392 --> 1:03:45.952
I don't want
to be doing this.

1:03:46.028 --> 1:03:50.125
Just making it through, player.
Just making it through.

1:04:20.099 --> 1:04:22.693
<i>So, while the shit
was going down tonight,</i>

1:04:22.768 --> 1:04:25.294
<i>I was doing
some detective work.</i>

1:04:26.873 --> 1:04:30.001
Mike says half the time,
she doesn't want to have sex.

1:04:31.311 --> 1:04:33.871
She just wants
to lay naked in the bed.

1:04:36.083 --> 1:04:38.074
But they're fucking, O.

1:04:38.152 --> 1:04:41.019
<i>And they have been
for over a month now.</i>

1:04:41.088 --> 1:04:43.181
<i>They do it in her room.</i>

1:04:43.257 --> 1:04:45.157
<i>And there's
one more thing...</i>

1:04:45.226 --> 1:04:48.128
Don't get mad at me
for saying this, but...

1:04:51.767 --> 1:04:54.032
they call you
"the nigger," man.

1:04:56.972 --> 1:04:59.771
Desi wouldn't say
nothing like that, man.

1:05:02.745 --> 1:05:04.838
Shit.

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:13.317
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

1:05:13.390 --> 1:05:16.086
Nothing.
What do you want?

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.595
Man, I just need
to talk to you.

1:05:18.662 --> 1:05:21.392
I'm a little busy.
Just give me two minutes.

1:05:22.467 --> 1:05:24.662
- All right, but-
- Give me two minutes, all right?

1:05:24.736 --> 1:05:26.203
Wait here.

1:05:31.376 --> 1:05:33.368
Hey, O. That's Mike.

1:05:33.479 --> 1:05:36.380
He wants to talk
to me about Desi.

1:05:36.448 --> 1:05:40.044
Listen, I'm going
to ask him what's up.

1:05:40.119 --> 1:05:42.417
All right?
You can hear for yourself.

1:05:45.692 --> 1:05:47.319
Come on,
let's take it out here.

1:05:47.394 --> 1:05:52.264
Hugo, you're my man
for life. Forever.

1:05:52.332 --> 1:05:54.698
Just stay on the porch
no matter what he says.

1:05:54.768 --> 1:05:58.466
Just stay on the bench.
Be quiet, all right?

1:06:03.344 --> 1:06:05.643
Hey, man, what have you got
going on here?

1:06:06.749 --> 1:06:08.215
What's up, big baller?

1:06:08.316 --> 1:06:10.581
Don't remind me of basketball.

1:06:10.652 --> 1:06:14.520
So, you and Desi have been
spending a lot of time together.

1:06:14.590 --> 1:06:17.219
If you could just handle her
the way you handle Brandy,

1:06:17.293 --> 1:06:18.920
then you'd be in business.

1:06:18.995 --> 1:06:21.589
That girl does whatever I say.

1:06:21.664 --> 1:06:23.359
She might be
in love with me, though.

1:06:23.433 --> 1:06:26.301
I heard she thinks the two
of you are going to get married.

1:06:26.369 --> 1:06:29.965
Yeah, right. Give me
some credit. She's a slut.

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:32.974
Man, I was
at the library yesterday.

1:06:33.043 --> 1:06:34.442
She took me in the back.

1:06:34.512 --> 1:06:37.174
In the freaking library?
No fucking way.

1:06:37.248 --> 1:06:39.979
And check this out.
She said, down the road,

1:06:40.084 --> 1:06:42.918
even if she's with somebody,
even if she's married,

1:06:42.987 --> 1:06:45.422
she said she'd do me
until the day she dies.

1:06:45.490 --> 1:06:47.185
No fucking way.

1:06:47.259 --> 1:06:49.250
She does follow me everywhere.

1:06:49.328 --> 1:06:50.795
Have you seen Michael?

1:06:50.863 --> 1:06:52.557
What about Odin?

1:06:52.631 --> 1:06:55.726
What about him?
He's a freaking loser.

1:06:55.801 --> 1:06:59.705
- The ghetto just popped out of him.
- You don't have to go there.

1:06:59.772 --> 1:07:02.468
Listen, the nigger's
out of control.

1:07:02.542 --> 1:07:04.567
And I'm glad
he's off the team.

1:07:04.644 --> 1:07:07.545
And if he comes at me again,
I swear I'll kill his ass.

1:07:07.614 --> 1:07:11.278
<i>Hugo, where's Michael?</i>

1:07:11.352 --> 1:07:13.013
<i>Hugo, I know Mike's in here.</i>

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:16.214
<i>- Open the damn door!
- Oh, boy.</i>

1:07:16.324 --> 1:07:18.019
- What's up?
- Hey.

1:07:18.092 --> 1:07:19.116
What the hell do you
think you're doing,

1:07:19.227 --> 1:07:21.593
<i>giving me something
you got from some other bitch?</i>

1:07:21.663 --> 1:07:23.255
What?

1:07:23.331 --> 1:07:26.199
- Asshole!
- What are you tripping about?

1:07:26.268 --> 1:07:27.929
- It's a present.
- Yeah?

1:07:28.003 --> 1:07:30.870
<i>Well, I like presents
where I was the only owner!</i>

1:07:30.940 --> 1:07:34.535
<i>Brandy.
You see what I have to deal with?</i>

1:07:34.610 --> 1:07:36.237
You want this?

1:07:46.757 --> 1:07:49.350
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

1:07:54.732 --> 1:07:57.497
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

1:07:58.570 --> 1:08:00.470
That's a big step.

1:08:02.073 --> 1:08:04.304
What about Desi?

1:08:15.388 --> 1:08:18.016
<i>I don't get people
in here with that kind of money.</i>

1:08:18.124 --> 1:08:21.150
<i>But it is
one hell of a watch.</i>

1:08:21.261 --> 1:08:23.320
What are you looking
to get for it?

1:08:29.904 --> 1:08:32.372
<i>You have any papers
on this .38?</i>

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:36.034
<i>On what?
Don't even look in that case.</i>

1:08:36.110 --> 1:08:39.911
<i>Don't even think about it, unless
you're ready to pull out some ID.</i>

1:08:42.217 --> 1:08:44.618
Listen,
you want that watch.

1:08:44.686 --> 1:08:47.349
I want that pistol.

1:09:14.819 --> 1:09:17.253
<i>You've been
everything to me, O.</i>

1:09:17.322 --> 1:09:20.883
<i>To me, you're not my friend,
you're my brother.</i>

1:09:20.959 --> 1:09:24.123
And when a brother
is wronged, so am I.

1:09:26.065 --> 1:09:27.965
<i>I'm you, O.</i>

1:09:28.033 --> 1:09:29.830
<i>I'm a part of you.</i>

1:09:32.171 --> 1:09:35.471
<i>The plan I've come up
with is flawless,</i>

1:09:36.543 --> 1:09:38.636
planned out to the minute.

1:09:40.447 --> 1:09:45.078
I've spent the last few days
going over every possible detail and angle.

1:09:46.886 --> 1:09:49.583
All we have to do
is set this thing in motion

1:09:49.657 --> 1:09:51.852
and never look back.

1:09:52.927 --> 1:09:55.589
Tomorrow I'm going
to talk to my dad.

1:09:55.663 --> 1:09:59.656
<i>I'm going to tell him me and Mike
will find our own way to the game.</i>

1:09:59.768 --> 1:10:01.963
<i>I'll say we
want to get there early.</i>

1:10:02.070 --> 1:10:04.868
<i>We'll take Roger's car.</i>

1:10:04.940 --> 1:10:06.840
<i>You're going
to talk to Desi.</i>

1:10:08.411 --> 1:10:11.244
<i>You'll tell her
you want to make up,</i>

1:10:11.314 --> 1:10:14.477
<i>a little love session
before the game.</i>

1:10:15.685 --> 1:10:18.746
<i>She should be
alone in her room.</i>

1:10:18.822 --> 1:10:21.154
<i>Emily will
go on without her.</i>

1:10:22.326 --> 1:10:26.490
<i>For it to work, we have to make
sure it looked like Michael did it.</i>

1:10:30.001 --> 1:10:32.469
<i>We'll leave behind
a little present.</i>

1:10:33.570 --> 1:10:36.096
<i>At exactly 7:00PM,</i>

1:10:37.242 --> 1:10:39.267
<i>you take out Desi...</i>

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:43.908
<i>and you plant Michael's glass.</i>

1:10:45.850 --> 1:10:48.979
<i>When that's all done,
you call me on Roger's cellular.</i>

1:10:51.957 --> 1:10:55.018
<i>We'll have a rental car
waiting on the side of the road.</i>

1:10:59.366 --> 1:11:01.095
<i>When Mike gets out to help,</i>

1:11:03.170 --> 1:11:05.900
<i>we'll make it
look like a suicide.</i>

1:11:31.067 --> 1:11:33.501
Then we all make our way
to the game on time.

1:11:35.205 --> 1:11:36.695
I know my dad.

1:11:36.773 --> 1:11:38.934
Without Mike,
he's got to play you.

1:11:39.043 --> 1:11:41.102
<i>So we win the game,</i>

1:11:42.213 --> 1:11:45.478
and we all swear
we never saw Mike or Desi at all.

1:11:48.552 --> 1:11:52.011
If we stick to the timetable,
this will work.

1:11:52.090 --> 1:11:53.955
What about Roger?

1:11:54.024 --> 1:11:57.358
Roger thinks you and
Desi are just breaking up.

1:11:57.429 --> 1:12:00.626
But after it's all over,
I'll tell him.

1:12:00.699 --> 1:12:04.192
He'll be so scared,
he'll go along with whatever I say.

1:12:05.905 --> 1:12:07.805
And if he doesn't?

1:12:07.874 --> 1:12:11.708
You said you're going all
the way with this thing, right?

1:12:26.761 --> 1:12:28.854
About what time
was the car checked out?

1:12:31.733 --> 1:12:32.757
Yeah.

1:12:32.834 --> 1:12:34.392
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

1:12:34.469 --> 1:12:36.700
Okay.
I appreciate it. Bye.

1:12:38.606 --> 1:12:41.906
Herb's on time, so far.

1:12:46.448 --> 1:12:47.711
All right.

1:12:53.824 --> 1:12:57.693
Hey, man. Man, it's
game time, baby. Let's do it.

1:12:58.361 --> 1:13:00.523
A little
pep-up for the road?

1:13:00.598 --> 1:13:03.122
No, I can't.
Not tonight.

1:13:03.201 --> 1:13:04.759
Oh Mike, come on.

1:13:04.836 --> 1:13:07.465
<i>This is my last game
as a Hawk, bro'.</i>

1:13:07.538 --> 1:13:09.335
I'm too nervous, man.

1:13:12.678 --> 1:13:16.010
We shall go no more
roving so late into the night.

1:13:16.081 --> 1:13:19.016
<i>- Look, man, I can't.
- Mike.</i>

1:13:19.117 --> 1:13:21.814
All right.

1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:30.354
Oh, fuck! I'm supposed
to meet with Brandy.

1:13:30.430 --> 1:13:32.955
- She was going to ride with us.
- Not anymore, comrade.

1:13:33.032 --> 1:13:36.002
<i>She's got wheels.
Don't worry about it.</i>

1:13:54.956 --> 1:13:57.015
You sure
you don't want me to wait?

1:13:57.126 --> 1:14:00.391
- Save me a seat.
- Okay.

1:14:00.428 --> 1:14:02.397
Later.

1:14:37.369 --> 1:14:39.860
Man, you're driving
like my grandmother.

1:14:41.740 --> 1:14:44.710
Come on, man.
The Duke is going to kill us.

1:15:08.971 --> 1:15:10.802
Did you see
that car back there?

1:15:10.872 --> 1:15:12.203
What?

1:15:14.676 --> 1:15:16.235
The one with
the flashing lights.

1:15:16.311 --> 1:15:20.408
- The guy might be in trouble.
- No, no way, man.

1:15:20.483 --> 1:15:22.451
We're going
to miss warm-ups.

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:25.919
It'll take just a second to check out.
It's going to be freezing tonight.

1:15:25.989 --> 1:15:27.855
We've got to check it out.

1:15:38.602 --> 1:15:42.094
Send someone over to check
on their rooms. Hurry!

1:15:42.172 --> 1:15:43.936
Let's go,
lads, let's go!

1:15:44.009 --> 1:15:47.537
Duke, this is Mr. Bradley, head of
the Game Council Athletic Department.

1:15:47.612 --> 1:15:49.671
Yes, sir. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

1:15:49.748 --> 1:15:52.546
It's a pleasure to meet you, couch.
I tell you, I've been following you all year,

1:15:52.617 --> 1:15:54.176
and you've done
a great job.

1:15:54.252 --> 1:15:56.517
Thanks very much.
I appreciate that.

1:15:56.589 --> 1:15:58.580
I wouldn't mind helping
you guys out next season.

1:15:58.657 --> 1:16:03.061
I hear that. I'd like to talk
to the Odin kid, if any way possible.

1:16:03.130 --> 1:16:06.121
<i>Sir, the whole world
would like to talk to Odin.</i>

1:16:06.233 --> 1:16:08.030
<i>Saw him
in the North Charleston semis,</i>

1:16:08.135 --> 1:16:11.902
<i>he lacerated their defense.
Nobody's done that all year.</i>

1:16:11.972 --> 1:16:15.272
<i>- He had some good coaching.
- Bradley: I'd have to agree with you.</i>

1:16:15.343 --> 1:16:17.243
<i>- Let's talk after the game, couch.
- All right, sir.</i>

1:16:17.311 --> 1:16:19.438
<i>He'd sure look good
in that garnet and black.</i>

1:16:20.515 --> 1:16:23.643
- Did you comp his ticket?
- Yes, I did.

1:16:23.719 --> 1:16:25.084
Come on, lads, let's go.

1:16:25.153 --> 1:16:27.088
Come on, sweat it up.

1:16:45.175 --> 1:16:47.006
Hey, mister,
you're all right?

1:16:48.746 --> 1:16:50.042
What the fuck?!

1:16:50.114 --> 1:16:52.343
Do it, Rog.
Do it.

1:16:54.118 --> 1:16:55.312
Fuck!

1:16:58.622 --> 1:17:00.784
Let it go!
Let it go!

1:17:03.762 --> 1:17:05.627
What the fuck, man?!

1:17:05.696 --> 1:17:07.392
What's wrong
with you, man?

1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:10.128
All right.

1:17:11.504 --> 1:17:14.302
No!
Shit! Fuck, Rog.

1:17:14.407 --> 1:17:19.174
It's got to look like
a fucking suicide! Fuck!

1:17:19.245 --> 1:17:22.977
I got him!
Just like you said.

1:17:23.050 --> 1:17:25.518
I shot the fucker!
Now, we do it close.

1:17:25.586 --> 1:17:28.521
No, the cops can tell
someone else shot the first bullet.

1:17:28.589 --> 1:17:31.422
You herbed us, man!
You fucking herbed us!

1:17:31.492 --> 1:17:33.289
You fucking herbed us!

1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:35.886
- Hugo, we have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1:17:35.964 --> 1:17:37.487
- You know I gave it to you.
- Where's the scarf?

1:17:37.564 --> 1:17:39.692
- We have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1:17:39.767 --> 1:17:43.168
- Let me get him off the road.
- Rog! Rog! Rog!

1:17:43.238 --> 1:17:46.834
When that car gets here, I'll tell
them you shot him in self- defense.

1:17:46.941 --> 1:17:49.001
He attacked you and
you shot him in self- defense.

1:17:49.110 --> 1:17:51.135
If he wakes up,
he's going to tell on me.

1:17:53.849 --> 1:17:57.547
It won't matter, Rog.
Desi's dead. I'm sorry, bro'.

1:18:08.765 --> 1:18:10.255
What time is it?

1:18:25.150 --> 1:18:26.913
Hold on! Hold on!

1:18:26.985 --> 1:18:30.785
Brandy,
call 911, okay?

1:18:30.857 --> 1:18:33.188
Roger hit Michael with a crow bar
and then Michael shot him.

1:18:49.143 --> 1:18:50.974
- Brandy, help me!
- Oh, my God!

1:18:51.045 --> 1:18:54.139
I need your help!
We need to get him to a hospital!

1:18:54.248 --> 1:18:57.343
Come on, Brandy,
you need to help me, please.

1:18:57.451 --> 1:18:59.420
Come on, Brandy!

1:18:59.521 --> 1:19:00.987
Brandy!

1:19:01.056 --> 1:19:02.182
Fuck!

1:19:55.282 --> 1:19:56.874
I'm sorry.

1:20:07.961 --> 1:20:10.362
I'm sorry.

1:20:12.900 --> 1:20:14.390
Odin.

1:20:44.068 --> 1:20:46.628
I saw Mike with the scarf.

1:20:46.704 --> 1:20:48.433
He's dead.

1:20:48.505 --> 1:20:50.496
He told me
you were with him.

1:20:50.574 --> 1:20:52.599
Now he's dead.

1:20:52.677 --> 1:20:54.440
He's dead.

1:20:56.715 --> 1:20:58.546
Stop. Stop.

1:20:59.884 --> 1:21:02.682
I want to be able
to let you go, but I can't.

1:21:02.754 --> 1:21:06.121
I wish I could,
but I can't. I can't.

1:21:06.225 --> 1:21:09.661
I can't. I can't.

1:21:15.535 --> 1:21:16.661
Shh.

1:21:16.737 --> 1:21:20.070
Shh. Shh.
Go to sleep.

1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:22.608
Shh. Stop. Please.

1:21:22.676 --> 1:21:24.668
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

1:21:24.746 --> 1:21:27.374
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

1:21:30.084 --> 1:21:32.712
- Jason, have you seen Desi?
- Nope.

1:21:32.787 --> 1:21:34.516
- What about Hugo?
- Uh-uh.

1:21:34.589 --> 1:21:36.113
No?

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:53.106
<i>Desi?</i>

1:21:53.176 --> 1:21:54.108
<i>Desi?</i>

1:21:59.015 --> 1:22:01.040
- Shh.
- Desi?

1:22:12.697 --> 1:22:13.959
Hey.

1:22:19.271 --> 1:22:20.602
They killed him!

1:22:20.672 --> 1:22:23.163
- They killed Michael!
- What are you talking about?

1:22:23.242 --> 1:22:24.174
Hugo!

1:22:24.243 --> 1:22:25.904
- You killed her?
- You shut up!

1:22:25.978 --> 1:22:28.446
- Shut up!
- You fucking killed her!

1:22:28.514 --> 1:22:30.243
- Hey.
- No!

1:22:30.316 --> 1:22:31.544
Tell me Odin is lying.

1:22:31.617 --> 1:22:35.144
Tell me you didn't say
Desi was cheating on him!

1:22:35.221 --> 1:22:38.486
- I told him what I heard.
- That's a lie! Desi and Michael!?

1:22:38.559 --> 1:22:40.652
- You said she slept with him!?
- Emily, shut up!

1:22:40.727 --> 1:22:44.254
- Somebody get an ambulance!
- Fuck off! Get off her!

1:22:44.331 --> 1:22:46.595
- Emily!
- She was a ho'!

1:22:46.700 --> 1:22:49.692
Desi was fucking Mike!
He admitted it!

1:22:49.804 --> 1:22:53.706
And she gave him my scarf.
They were laughing at me!

1:22:53.775 --> 1:22:55.367
Hugo, tell her!

1:22:55.443 --> 1:22:57.674
- Tell her, man!
- That silk scarf?

1:22:57.746 --> 1:22:59.373
Emily, be quiet.

1:22:59.448 --> 1:23:01.348
No. No, Hugo.

1:23:01.416 --> 1:23:04.409
- Shut the fuck up, Emily.
- Hugo had that scarf.

1:23:04.487 --> 1:23:06.513
- Emily.
- You begged me to steal it for you!

1:23:06.589 --> 1:23:09.150
She's fucking lying, bro'.
She is fuckin' lying.

1:23:09.226 --> 1:23:11.284
Don't even fucking pay
any attention to her.

1:23:11.361 --> 1:23:13.693
- You gave that scarf to Michael.
- Tell the truth!

1:23:13.763 --> 1:23:16.630
- You gave that scarf to Michael!
- Tell the truth, Emily!

1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:18.190
You gave
that scarf to Michael!

1:23:37.956 --> 1:23:39.548
Stay down!

1:23:56.443 --> 1:24:00.846
Jason,
ask him why he did this.

1:24:00.914 --> 1:24:02.780
Ask him!

1:24:02.850 --> 1:24:05.115
You won't ask me nothing.

1:24:05.186 --> 1:24:08.052
I did what I did.
That's all you need to know.

1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:14.952
From here on,
I'll say nothing.

1:24:15.030 --> 1:24:17.863
Hugo...

1:24:21.403 --> 1:24:22.928
Hugo!

1:24:23.005 --> 1:24:24.529
Sit the fuck down!

1:24:24.607 --> 1:24:28.441
Everybody sit down
and shut the fuck up!

1:24:28.544 --> 1:24:30.876
Now, somebody
here knows the truth.

1:24:30.947 --> 1:24:34.315
Somebody needs
to tell the goddamn truth.

1:24:35.686 --> 1:24:38.712
My life is over.
That's it.

1:24:38.789 --> 1:24:41.815
But while you're
all out here living yours,

1:24:41.892 --> 1:24:45.852
sitting around, talking about the nigger
who lost it, back in high school,

1:24:45.930 --> 1:24:49.491
you make sure
you tell them the truth.

1:24:49.567 --> 1:24:52.332
You tell them
I loved that girl.

1:24:52.404 --> 1:24:54.429
I did.

1:24:54.506 --> 1:24:55.871
But I got played.

1:24:55.941 --> 1:24:58.910
He twisted my head up.
He fucked it up.

1:25:00.012 --> 1:25:02.378
I ain't no different
than none of you all.

1:25:02.448 --> 1:25:04.417
My mom ain't no crack head.

1:25:04.484 --> 1:25:06.349
I wasn't no gangbanger.

1:25:06.419 --> 1:25:09.388
It wasn't some hood rat
drug dealer that tripped me up.

1:25:09.489 --> 1:25:13.358
It was this white, prep school
motherfucker standing right there.

1:25:13.427 --> 1:25:14.518
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

1:25:14.594 --> 1:25:16.585
Come on, son!
Drop it! Put it down!

1:25:16.663 --> 1:25:19.064
You tell them
where I'm from...

1:25:19.133 --> 1:25:20.998
didn't make me do this.

1:26:57.639 --> 1:27:01.007
<i>All my life,
I always wanted to fly.</i>

1:27:02.377 --> 1:27:05.370
<i>I always wanted
to live like a hawk.</i>

1:27:17.261 --> 1:27:20.561
<i>I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...</i>

1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:23.861
<i>to take flight,</i>

1:27:25.070 --> 1:27:27.834
<i>to soar above
everything and everyone...</i>

1:27:30.375 --> 1:27:32.172
<i>now, that's living.</i>

1:27:36.182 --> 1:27:39.276
<i>But a hawk is no good
around normal birds.</i>

1:27:41.087 --> 1:27:42.987
<i>It can't fit in.</i>

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:48.319
<i>Even though all the other birds
probably want to be hawks,</i>

1:27:50.097 --> 1:27:52.327
<i>they hate him
for what they can't be-</i>

1:27:54.769 --> 1:27:56.030
<i>proud,</i>

1:27:57.104 --> 1:27:59.130
<i>powerful,</i>

1:27:59.207 --> 1:28:00.730
<i>determined,</i>

1:28:03.878 --> 1:28:05.402
<i>dark.</i>

1:28:08.951 --> 1:28:10.885
<i>Odin is a hawk.</i>

1:28:12.888 --> 1:28:14.753
<i>He soars above us.</i>

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.328
<i>He can fly.</i>

1:28:28.038 --> 1:28:30.063
<i>And one of these days,</i>

1:28:31.141 --> 1:28:33.804
<i>everyone is going
to pay attention to me...</i>

1:28:42.119 --> 1:28:44.883
<i>because I'm going
to fly, too.</i>
