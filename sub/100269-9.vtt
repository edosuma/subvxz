00:46.880 --> 00:49.299
<i> We're friends, Delilah.</i>
<i>We're good friends.</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:50.884
I'm not going to hurt you.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.052
Please!

00:52.135 --> 00:54.387
<i> But I wouldn't have. No.</i>

00:55.096 --> 00:57.307
<i>No, no... no.</i>

00:57.640 --> 00:59.100
I don't want to die in here.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.518
You won't.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.606
<i> I promised. I meant it.</i>
<i>I wouldn't have done this.</i>

01:04.689 --> 01:06.816
<i>I worked so hard for you, Love.</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
<i>This couldn't have been me.</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:12.072
<i>-But she was a threat to us.</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:14.824
<i>She could've exposed me. Kept me from you.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:16.201
<i>I had motive.</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:17.660
I want to be with you.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.747
<i> No, it doesn't make sense.</i>

01:20.830 --> 01:23.625
<i>Because if I did this,</i>
<i>I don't deserve you.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:27.295
<i>What it makes me, there could be no us.</i>

01:27.587 --> 01:30.548
<i>I knew that. I knew that!</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.511
<i>The acid.</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:37.514
<i>What happened last night?</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:44.104
<i>I have to know who killed Delilah.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:46.564
<i> Even if it was me.</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:54.697
<i>The bar. We were at the bar.</i>

01:54.906 --> 01:58.868
<i>Everything was fine. And that was...</i>
<i>What? Eight-ish?</i>

02:03.873 --> 02:04.916
Cheers!

02:05.208 --> 02:07.252
That is the time
you started drinking.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.795
You drugged me?

02:11.422 --> 02:14.467
<i> Dosed, 8:52 p.m.</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:19.556
<i>And then things were not fine.</i>
<i>I don't know where or when the fuck I was.</i>

02:19.722 --> 02:21.057
Are you really leaving LA?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.976
My daughter's having
one of her drama queen days.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.734
<i> Too much time unaccounted for.</i>

02:32.443 --> 02:34.904
<i>That is time to murder.</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:37.448
<i>If not, where was I?</i>
<i>What the hell was I doing?</i>

02:38.783 --> 02:41.327
-<i> Go for Forty.</i>
-Forty, I am so glad I got you.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.913
-I was hoping that--

02:44.080 --> 02:46.040
<i> Sucker. Leave a message.</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:49.711
Hey, it's me.<i> </i>It's Joe.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.007
Oh, what a night.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.635
I wanted to check in on you,
so call me when you get this. Thanks.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.888
<i> Okay, step one.</i>

02:59.971 --> 03:03.892
<i>She needs to be alive.</i>
<i>I can't have people looking for her.</i>

03:04.225 --> 03:06.686
<i>Like Officer other David Fincher.</i>

03:10.148 --> 03:11.649
<i>Shit. Ellie.</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:14.736
<i>No, I couldn't have done this to her.</i>

03:14.819 --> 03:17.155
<i>Right. Facial recognition. That's great.</i>

03:17.238 --> 03:18.448
<i>Let's go. </i>

03:54.734 --> 03:55.568
Shit!

03:58.905 --> 04:00.657
<i> I can't just leave her here.</i>

04:00.740 --> 04:06.621
<i>Whoever did this either left in a hurry</i>
<i>or just wanted this to be my mess.</i>

04:06.704 --> 04:08.373
<i>Is this a frame job?</i>

04:08.456 --> 04:11.042
<i>Are the police on their way?</i>

04:11.125 --> 04:13.211
<i>I should run.</i>

04:13.294 --> 04:16.130
<i>No. I can't leave her here.</i>

04:16.214 --> 04:17.882
<i>I can't leave her for anyone to find.</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:21.928
<i>I also can't move her in broad daylight.</i>
<i>I've got to wait till dark.</i>

04:22.178 --> 04:24.514
<i>It's taking a chance either way,</i>

04:24.597 --> 04:27.016
<i>but Los Angeles heat,</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.435
<i>decomp's gonna happen fast.</i>

04:36.526 --> 04:40.655
<i> At best, buys five to six hours.</i>
<i>But I'll make the most of it.</i>

04:41.114 --> 04:43.825
<i>Figure out what the hell happened</i>
<i>last night.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:50.623
T, M.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.460
Dude, slow down.
You'll be dead before you kiss the girl.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.882
<i> He was the only one who knew</i>
<i>this was here.</i>

04:59.966 --> 05:03.219
<i>I took his name. Caged him.</i>

05:03.303 --> 05:06.389
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>revenge wouldn't be out of the question.</i>

05:06.472 --> 05:08.975
<i>Why kill Delilah, not me, though?</i>

05:09.517 --> 05:11.644
You exposed us, and now they're...

05:12.395 --> 05:14.272
<i>Could have been off his meds. Right.</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:29.412
<i>Hello?</i>

05:29.579 --> 05:30.747
<i>Kamusta?</i>

05:30.872 --> 05:32.457
Uh, hi. I'm looking for Will.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.793
Hello?

05:35.877 --> 05:37.837
<i> He didn't give a real number</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.006
<i>because he is not in Manila?</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:42.175
<i>He was here, killing Delilah?</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:44.552
<i> Hello, friend! What's up?</i>

05:44.635 --> 05:45.803
Will!

05:46.804 --> 05:48.973
<i> Oh! See that? Living proof.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:50.641
<i>I have let people out of the cage,</i>

05:50.725 --> 05:52.852
<i>made friends, even, from the experience.</i>

05:52.935 --> 05:54.604
Was that Gigi who just picked up?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.898
It's everything I told you, man.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.524
I never doubted it.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.276
<i> Okay, I did. But I shouldn't have.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:03.154
<i>Like I shouldn't have considered Will</i>
<i>a suspect.</i>

06:03.237 --> 06:04.655
<i>He is a good man.</i>

06:04.739 --> 06:07.575
Why do you look like someone hit you
on the head with a rock,

06:07.658 --> 06:09.202
threw you in the trunk of their car?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.787
<i>I'm tired, that's all.</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:15.166
<i>Talk to a brother. Joe, you can tell me.</i>

06:15.583 --> 06:17.502
Why do you think I gave you
my real number?

06:17.585 --> 06:21.381
Honestly, Will,
you have some real mental health issues.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.132
Because...

06:23.758 --> 06:28.346
I know you can get yourself
in interesting jams.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.515
<i>But you want to do right.</i>

06:31.265 --> 06:33.851
<i>-If I can help...</i>
-Why do you wanna help me?

06:33.935 --> 06:37.814
We all just gotta just try
and do the decent thing, moving forward.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.485
You know when you pick up a spider,

06:42.568 --> 06:45.321
<i>and you bring it outside</i>
<i>because you want it to live?</i>

06:46.197 --> 06:48.366
But let's say when it's in your hand,

06:48.991 --> 06:51.953
it dies anyway,
and you don't know if it's your fault.

06:52.995 --> 06:53.996
But it was in your hand?

06:54.080 --> 06:57.125
<i>Well, no, it's-- I mean,</i>
<i>it's an imperfect metaphor,</i>

06:57.834 --> 07:01.963
but the-- the point is,
you-- you wanted it... to live.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.132
If I'm hearing you right...

07:05.049 --> 07:08.886
you have someone in your cage...

07:09.095 --> 07:10.471
who is now dead.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.142
But you don't think you killed them.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.436
Will, it wasn't me.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.981
I mean, I don't know that
because I was on a lot of drugs.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.942
But I was going to let her go.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.277
<i>Just like you.</i>

07:24.360 --> 07:27.321
I don't think you'd kill someone
you intended to keep alive.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.324
Honestly, Will, I don't know
what happened, and I have to know.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.078
I really feel like I--
I would <i>not</i> have done this.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.204
<i>I believe you.</i>

07:36.539 --> 07:40.835
<i>But, end of the day...</i>
<i>only you know who you really are.</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:45.214
Whether you really wanted
to let that spider go or not.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.342
Thanks, Will.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.219
<i>Anytime, Will.</i>

08:10.281 --> 08:12.575
I don't think I did this to you.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.244
I'm going to prove I didn't.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.997
<i> Find out who did.</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:21.792
<i>Far be it from Forty to answer a text.</i>

08:21.876 --> 08:25.254
<i>Especially when he's responsible</i>
<i>for my night being a black hole.</i>

08:26.339 --> 08:28.966
<i>I would be sleeping off</i>
<i>the night's debaucheries</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:31.511
<i>if I hadn't woken into a nightmare.</i>

08:32.220 --> 08:34.138
<i>I'll rest</i>
<i>when there's not</i>

08:34.222 --> 08:36.557
<i>-a murderer on the loose.</i>

08:36.641 --> 08:37.600
It's open.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.728
Hey.

08:41.896 --> 08:42.772
Whoa.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.440
I thought <i>I </i>had a rough night.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.817
Love, hey.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.072
-Weren't you writing?
-Yeah, your brother's got a process.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.616
What are you doing here?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.244
You don't... remember?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.957
Oh, God, was I that drunk?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.251
Did I get this wrong
and I'm just embarrassing myself--

09:03.751 --> 09:05.711
Of course I remember.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.673
The greatest call of my life.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.050
-The greatest?
-Yes.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.182
<i> If we're together, we're okay.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:28.609
I love you.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.530
I love you... Love.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.076
<i> I can figure this out for us.</i>

09:39.495 --> 09:41.080
Oh, about that. Um...

09:41.998 --> 09:43.666
"I'd go anywhere for you" thing?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.460
I meant that, I did.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.338
But now that I am sober...

09:50.548 --> 09:52.508
could we just slow down that part
a little bit?

09:52.842 --> 09:53.759
Of course.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.969
-Okay.
-<i> Perfect.</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:58.472
<i>Because time is what I need</i>
<i>to find out who did this to Delilah,</i>

09:58.556 --> 10:02.935
<i>clear my name, protect you,</i>
<i>confirm I'm worthy of you, Love.</i>

10:04.645 --> 10:05.563
Uh...

10:05.855 --> 10:07.857
Does this mean
you're not screwing my sister anymore?

10:09.859 --> 10:13.237
-Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.907
Probably just the four tabs of acid
working their way out of his system.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.702
You were on acid last night?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.705
That's your brother's process.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.541
I didn't know he was gonna dose us.
I kept him out of trouble.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.543
Okay, but where is he? Is he okay?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.337
I can't believe
you didn't mention anything.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.379
Forty's fine.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.841
I saw him get in the car
when I left the hotel, like, an hour ago.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.220
Speaking of missing people...

10:40.514 --> 10:41.932
Anyone see my sister?

10:42.516 --> 10:44.769
-No.
-I haven't seen her.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.480
It's fine.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.774
I just wanted to show her
this death threat she got.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.651
What? Let me see that. What?

10:53.819 --> 10:54.945
This is awful.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.614
Because of the article?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.533
<i> Is that what happened?</i>

10:59.617 --> 11:02.078
<i>Some Henderson crazy followed me</i>
<i>to the cage?</i>

11:02.161 --> 11:06.207
<i>Slit Delilah's throat</i>
<i>because she showed them who he really was?</i>

11:06.707 --> 11:09.210
-We should show it to the police.
-I will.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.174
Hey, Ellie. Maybe you shouldn't go back
to your apartment

11:15.257 --> 11:16.801
till your sister gets back.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.388
But we can walk to the market.
I can make you some breakfast.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.100
Okay. Um...

11:24.767 --> 11:27.937
Yeah, we'll let Will shower off the night,
and we can get going.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.484
<i> Poor girl has no idea</i>
<i>her life is about to change.</i>

11:34.151 --> 11:35.528
<i>-Forever.</i>

11:37.988 --> 11:38.989
Joey.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.784
You don't have to hide.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.246
Remember when we came back,

11:45.955 --> 11:46.831
what I said?

11:47.915 --> 11:49.166
How things would be different?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.294
I meant it.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.224
He's <i>never</i> gonna hurt us again.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.351
Ever.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.603
You hear me?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.459
<i> What the...?</i>

12:32.460 --> 12:34.170
<i>The hell?</i>

12:38.132 --> 12:40.092
-Freeze, asshole!

12:40.217 --> 12:42.178
-<i> Calvin.</i>
- <i>Crying...</i>

12:42.762 --> 12:43.888
You know what that means.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.806
<i> Rule number three.</i>

12:45.890 --> 12:48.851
-If you cannot stop sobbing, just drink...
- <i>Moon Juice.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:50.186
You're gonna go to Anavrin.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.771
<i> I left while I was tripping.</i>

12:51.854 --> 12:53.230
<i>Went to Anavrin.</i>

12:53.314 --> 12:55.775
<i>What says</i>
<i>I didn't make a detour to murder?</i>

12:58.944 --> 13:00.946
<i>Or I went straight to Anavrin and back.</i>

13:01.405 --> 13:05.117
<i>Maybe Calvin can put me there long enough</i>
<i>to account for all the lost time.</i>

13:05.201 --> 13:07.536
-Bettelheim. Right?
- <i>Other Fincher.</i>

13:07.620 --> 13:09.830
<i>-Just what I need.</i>
-I'm sorry, what's your name<i> </i>again?

13:09.914 --> 13:10.790
Fincher.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.792
Officer Fincher.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.752
That's right. Delilah's friend.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.545
You seen her around lately?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.048
<i> Hm, and operates</i>
<i>with all the nuance of Columbo.</i>

13:19.131 --> 13:20.174
I haven't, actually.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.260
<i> Now, if her phone worked, I could</i>
<i>have her tell him she's chasing a lead</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:25.763
<i>from Paul Rudd's holistic nutritionist,</i>
<i>but alas, it doesn't.</i>

13:26.138 --> 13:27.139
I hope she's okay.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.351
Why would you say that?

13:30.893 --> 13:34.438
Well... her sister, Ellie,
mentioned she hadn't seen her either.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.524
And, actually...

13:38.943 --> 13:39.944
they got this.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.365
I was gonna bring it by the station.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.412
Apparently, that article she wrote
has got a lot of Hendy fans stirred up.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.581
And I hate to overreact.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.417
Supposedly, some real sickos
have been DMing her.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.087
One even broke into Henderson's place

13:58.170 --> 14:02.007
and tried to stab him a while back...
But I mean, I'm sure you know all this,

14:02.091 --> 14:04.385
after what happened to him.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.554
-Of course.
-So...

14:07.763 --> 14:10.015
Again, I'm probably overreacting...

14:10.766 --> 14:13.269
but I'm glad
someone's looking out for her.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.896
<i> And at the risk of laying it on...</i>

14:16.397 --> 14:17.815
Oh, and I should tell you...

14:18.357 --> 14:21.527
she broke things off with me.
I think she really likes you, man.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.323
Uh...

14:27.783 --> 14:30.202
If you see her, have her call me.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.287
Will do.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.207
<i> Statistics force me to consider</i>
<i>Officer Douchebag as a suspect.</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:38.669
<i>Too often, it's the jealous boyfriend,</i>
<i>spurned lover.</i>

14:43.883 --> 14:46.343
<i> As much as I'd like to pin it</i>
<i>on him,</i>

14:46.427 --> 14:49.847
<i>all I see is a heartsick puppy dog.</i>

15:02.067 --> 15:04.028
Okay, you gotta remember the part

15:04.111 --> 15:06.947
where you were ranting about
how all the peaches were mad at you.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.742
Calvin, I'm glad you find this so funny.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.536
-I just really need to find--
-I know, find your wallet.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.706
Uh, just, the next time you do acid,

15:15.789 --> 15:17.750
please record it for your future self.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.710
And by that, I mean all of us.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.837
<i> Believe me. I wish I had.</i>

15:21.921 --> 15:24.131
What-- What time would you say
that I got here?

15:24.715 --> 15:28.218
11:18. How do I know that?
Because you didn't turn the alarm off.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.014
Made me come down here and jump your ass
like you were some common criminal.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.682
So, I just got a Moon Juice,

15:33.766 --> 15:35.434
and then... when did I leave?

15:35.517 --> 15:38.312
Oh, uh, you were all on me about Cheetos.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.356
Like we carry that ish.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.274
<i> Cheetos? Oh, no.</i>

15:42.358 --> 15:43.525
-Had to be--
-Flamin' Hot?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.903
Ah! So you do remember some fun stuff.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.446
<i> For Delilah.</i>

15:47.529 --> 15:50.199
You kept saying you needed snacks
for the basement.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.825
You kept asking me where the door was.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.703
I was like, "Sweetie, this is California.
No basements."

15:54.787 --> 15:55.955
<i> The basement.</i>

15:56.497 --> 15:58.999
<i>I must've thought</i>
<i>that's where the cage was.</i>

15:59.083 --> 16:02.002
<i>I was headed to see Delilah.</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:04.838
<i>Hold on. None of this stuff was there.</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:06.882
<i>No Cheetos, nothing. So--</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:10.844
Did I happen to mention
where I was headed when I left?

16:11.220 --> 16:15.432
Yeah. That would suggest a level
of clarity that you did not possess.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.559
Which is why I didn't say anything
last night,

16:17.643 --> 16:20.688
but you need to pay the store back,
even when Forty's with you.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.898
Forty was with me?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.067
You're kidding, right?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.986
<i> I thought he never left the hotel.</i>

16:27.069 --> 16:29.279
You don't remember him
trying to get one of us

16:29.363 --> 16:32.241
to shove a Grey Goose-infused tampon
up his ass?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.576
So he could keep his high
at a "cruising altitude"?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.082
<i> If Forty was with me,</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:43.293
<i>I would avoid the storage unit</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

16:43.377 --> 16:47.423
<i>That's why none of the food</i>
<i>for Delilah was there. I never went.</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:51.218
<i>If only my alibi would pick up</i>
<i>his fucking phone.</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:54.513
<i>And by now, Love,</i>
<i>you're wondering where I am.</i>

17:09.653 --> 17:13.073
Hey! Uh-uh. I think one cup's enough
for a 15-year-old.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.575
Okay.

17:15.951 --> 17:16.827
Okay, now.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.038
If you could chop these?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.749
-Okay.
-Here.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.086
You can tuck your fingers underneath.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.297
-It's safer that way and hold the knife...
-Like this?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.257
-All right.
-Now hold your knife like this.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.508
-Up here?
-Mm-hmm.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.848
- Like that?
-Yeah, that's it.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.102
So, how long have you and your sister
been on your own?

17:42.686 --> 17:47.941
I guess my amazing life here started
after my dad got sick.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.611
Which is awesome

17:50.694 --> 17:54.073
when he's your only friend in the world,
and you also hate your mom.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.449
Oh.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.035
Okay. Sounds like we have the same mom.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.417
The punchline, obviously,
is that my dad died.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.839
Don't. It's so awkward.
Let's just move on.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.674
Um...

18:13.133 --> 18:14.093
How are these?

18:16.970 --> 18:17.888
I mean...

18:18.639 --> 18:20.516
if the film thing doesn't work out,

18:21.225 --> 18:23.977
you should consider culinary school
in Paris.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.107
Those are really even. That's really good.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.650
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.947
So your dad left you
with the shitty parent. And then what?

18:35.030 --> 18:36.698
Delilah bolted first.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.369
I endured a couple more years,
and then showed up and ruined her life.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.205
It's fine. Feeling's mutual.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.420
-Something like that?
-Yeah. I can take those.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.131
Thank you.

19:10.190 --> 19:14.069
<i> I pray your brother's home,</i>
<i>just so I can figure this out, Love.</i>

19:20.409 --> 19:22.536
Will. What a pleasant surprise.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.496
-<i> Wish I could say the same.</i>
-Come in.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.042
I was sorry to hear you're leaving LA.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.380
Actually, I'm still working on that.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.631
Nothing's definite yet.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.593
Well, then perhaps
we can persuade you to stay.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.386
Please.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.899
I wanted to thank you.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.570
Forty was all but inconsolable
when I picked him up this morning.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.989
He said you were really there for him
last night.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.073
<i> I was?</i>

20:01.742 --> 20:03.702
The night's a bit blurry.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.830
You don't have to pretend with me.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.875
I know what he confessed to you.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.710
<i> Confessed?</i>

20:12.419 --> 20:13.503
I killed her.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.049
<i> Holy shit! How could I forget?</i>

20:17.132 --> 20:20.260
My husband and I appreciate the burden
our son's put on you.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.723
We also want you to know
we're here to ease your burdens.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.350
However great they may be.

20:26.934 --> 20:30.187
Your secrets are safe with us, Will.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.899
<i> Never has a threat worn</i>
<i>such a luxuriant veil.</i>

20:33.982 --> 20:36.193
<i>And just what is it your parents think</i>
<i>they know about me?</i>

20:36.276 --> 20:38.779
<i>What the hell did I tell Forty last night?</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:41.740
- Mom!
-I'll let him know you're here.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.661
<i>Add it to the list of mysteries.</i>

21:00.384 --> 21:01.426
<i> No.</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:04.763
-<i> Couldn't be.</i>
-<i> Joe...</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:06.515
Would you fuck me?

21:07.975 --> 21:11.603
Come on. You would totally fuck me.

21:11.687 --> 21:15.148
<i> Forty's my alibi, not my suspect.</i>

21:15.232 --> 21:17.359
<i>Just because he killed before</i>
<i>doesn't mean he'd--</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:20.112
<i>Well, unless he was crying to your mother</i>
<i>this morning</i>

21:20.195 --> 21:22.197
<i>because he killed again.</i>

21:22.656 --> 21:25.200
<i>Did I tell him I had Delilah in the cage?</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:27.744
<i>That she was the reason</i>
<i>I had to give up on you and leave town?</i>

21:27.828 --> 21:29.913
<i>Would Forty kill to keep us together?</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:30.872
Old sport.

21:31.873 --> 21:32.791
Aw.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.584
Comedown is a bitch.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.963
But that trip. I mean...

21:38.547 --> 21:41.008
We touched God.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.803
Like,<i> </i>"tickled-His-balls" touched.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.055
Inspired work, Broseph.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.099
Forty?

21:50.892 --> 21:53.061
My Gaia. My Isis.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.980
Oh, thank you.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.984
Soothed my weary soul, as usual.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.068
I love you.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.449
Bye, boys.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.659
Hoo!

22:08.827 --> 22:10.704
What an epic night. Ooh!

22:12.372 --> 22:15.125
<i> Look at him.</i>
<i>He’d have to be a complete sociopath.</i>

22:15.709 --> 22:16.668
<i>Or blacked out.</i>

22:17.878 --> 22:18.837
Oh, are you gonna puke?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.298
'Cause that's totally fine,
just not over here.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.550
It's antique camel hair on demo.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.721
That is for you.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.391
Bro, seriously?

22:31.892 --> 22:32.976
You complete me.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.855
I have to admit, I'm a little foggy. Uh...

22:39.024 --> 22:41.401
I remember we made the run to Anavrin.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.948
Yeah, that place.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.327
Where did we go after Anavrin?

22:53.246 --> 22:54.247
<i> What was that?</i>

22:54.790 --> 22:56.208
You know, um...

22:57.250 --> 22:59.002
-It's kind of a blur.
-<i> He's lying.</i>

22:59.086 --> 23:00.337
<i>Why is he lying?</i>

23:00.420 --> 23:02.672
We stopped somewhere else, right?

23:03.256 --> 23:07.302
Yeah. Again, man, it's such a blur.
I don't really know. Um...

23:08.845 --> 23:09.721
Are you okay?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.351
You know, this is your fault.

23:14.768 --> 23:18.355
All right? You were the one that wanted
to go see Delilah, and...

23:19.314 --> 23:22.818
I would never have done it
if it weren’t for you.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.446
<i> Holy shit. It </i>was <i>him.</i>

23:26.530 --> 23:29.324
I'm like, really, <i>really</i> sorry.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.617
What are you sorry for?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.327
I know that you know what I did.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.540
I was with Candace last night.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.667
Candace?

23:39.668 --> 23:42.045
I know that I screwed up.

23:42.129 --> 23:47.759
But if you hadn’t booty-called Delilah,
I never would have called her.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.969
<i> Booty-call?</i>

23:49.052 --> 23:50.887
<i>Forty has no idea what happened.</i>

23:50.971 --> 23:53.598
I told you that we should go back to work,

23:53.682 --> 23:57.644
but you made Igor drive us
to that random corner downtown.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.566
What is this place, Betteljuice?

24:03.150 --> 24:07.904
Is "Delilah," like,
code for you getting homeless vag?

24:09.406 --> 24:10.657
<i> He didn’t do it.</i>

24:10.740 --> 24:13.577
<i>He dropped me off</i>
<i>and then went to screw Candace.</i>

24:13.660 --> 24:14.953
You told me to go.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.372
<i> Worse, he left me there alone.</i>

24:17.622 --> 24:20.250
So you<i> </i>leave me on a corner?

24:21.334 --> 24:23.086
-Completely out of my mind?
-Yeah.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.713
Look, I fucked up, all right?

24:24.796 --> 24:27.048
And I fucked her, and I fucked us.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.759
I told you we were only sexting
now and again...

24:29.843 --> 24:33.889
<i>Motive, I had.</i>
<i>He gave me means. Opportunity.</i>

24:33.972 --> 24:35.765
I was lonely, okay? And, like...

24:36.308 --> 24:40.228
redheads, you know?
I just figured what’s the harm in--

24:40.312 --> 24:41.480
"What’s the harm"?

24:42.230 --> 24:44.149
I had to leave everything behind
because of her.

24:44.232 --> 24:48.570
-She is the reason I lost everything.
-But you found Love.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.906
How could you leave me for her?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.159
I’m really, really so sorry.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.328
Please forgive me. Joe, come on. Please?

24:56.411 --> 24:58.872
<i> I can forgive your brother</i>
<i>for seeing Candace.</i>

24:58.955 --> 25:01.625
<i>What I can’t forgive</i>
<i>is him leaving me there</i>

25:01.708 --> 25:03.168
<i>with a head full of acid.</i>

25:03.251 --> 25:04.085
Look...

25:05.545 --> 25:06.630
Oh, God.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.635
Okay, I'm gonna be right back. Okay?

25:11.718 --> 25:12.928
I'm just gonna be right back!

25:14.804 --> 25:16.890
<i> Unless this was Candace.</i>

25:17.224 --> 25:19.935
<i>Some elaborate plot to set me up.</i>

25:20.018 --> 25:22.312
<i>But why kill Delilah?</i>

25:23.230 --> 25:24.439
<i>Why not just kill me?</i>

25:24.523 --> 25:27.984
<i>She had her chance.</i>
<i>Still, this doesn’t mean it was me.</i>

25:28.068 --> 25:30.820
<i>Forty can put me there.</i>
<i>What’s to say I went in?</i>

25:31.321 --> 25:32.364
<i> Hold up.</i>

25:32.447 --> 25:34.491
Hey, wait.

25:35.825 --> 25:36.910
Take this.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.540
Give it to Delilah.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.083
And when you fuck her,

25:43.166 --> 25:44.376
you think of me.

25:46.586 --> 25:47.462
Okay?

25:48.296 --> 25:49.798
So don't ghost me.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.216
All right?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.927
Or do.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.095
Get it?

25:56.012 --> 25:57.347
<i> Oh, man.</i>

25:57.722 --> 26:00.058
<i>But why can’t I remember it?</i>

26:00.559 --> 26:05.730
<i>Am I just clenching my eyes shut</i>
<i>against some truth I don’t want to face?</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:12.279
Hey, you.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.489
-<i> You need to get over here now.</i>

26:14.698 --> 26:15.824
<i>Ellie's freaking out.</i>

26:21.871 --> 26:23.540
Hey, hey. Um...

26:23.790 --> 26:25.542
Everything was fine, and then...

26:27.252 --> 26:29.462
She's convinced something happened
to her sister.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.725
Stay the hell away from me.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.437
Ellie.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.731
-I said stay the hell away from me!

26:47.856 --> 26:49.691
Don't! Let go! No!

26:49.774 --> 26:50.775
-Stop!
-It's okay.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.820
Stop. Let go. Let go of me. Stop.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.238
Let go.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.991
It's just me.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.911
It's gonna be okay.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.081
It’s not gonna be okay!

27:06.166 --> 27:07.709
It’s always gonna be a mess!

27:08.335 --> 27:10.462
-What? What’s gonna be a mess?
-My life.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.965
My whole fucking life!

27:14.841 --> 27:16.801
Why won't she respond to my texts?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.304
I’m sure she has a good reason.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.848
She’s never left me alone
this long before.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.600
I know something happened to her.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.518
You don’t know that.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.187
She was pulling away from me.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.023
I could tell.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.777
Everybody wants to get away from me!

27:37.906 --> 27:38.740
Why?

27:40.492 --> 27:41.826
What’s wrong with me?

27:43.286 --> 27:44.162
Ellie.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.041
There's nothing’s wrong with you.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.585
Nothing.

27:51.961 --> 27:52.921
It’s not you.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.429
<i> It's me.</i>

28:02.305 --> 28:03.640
Don't ever think that.

28:11.147 --> 28:14.776
<i> I know what you see, Love.</i>
<i>A good man.</i>

28:20.990 --> 28:22.909
<i>But I have my doubts.</i>

28:36.297 --> 28:38.967
You are a genius, Forty Quinn.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.852
If I was your agent,
I would be sucking your dick right now.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.187
That's quite an endorsement.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.606
Well, somebody woke up
on the wrong side of an acid trip.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.192
Okay. Um, look...

28:57.193 --> 28:59.571
-Last night was a mistake. Okay?
-Yeah.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.406
The good kind, right?

29:01.489 --> 29:02.365
No.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.492
-I was high.
-Yeah.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.787
I hate when I slide
into a girl’s vagina without meaning to.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.291
Stop. No. I’m serious.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.461
If Joe hadn’t booty-called Delilah,
I would never--

29:14.544 --> 29:15.670
Wait, what?

29:16.921 --> 29:18.757
The manager from his place?

29:19.507 --> 29:20.467
That Delilah?

29:20.550 --> 29:22.302
See? He’s right.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.095
You are all about him.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.806
-And you were just using me--
-Wait, Joe said that?

29:27.223 --> 29:30.810
-Did he tell you what to say to me?
-God. Just stop.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.855
You are obsessed with him.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.357
I mean, why else would you still be here

29:36.441 --> 29:38.693
after my sister paid you to go?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.279
I am trying to protect you...

29:42.405 --> 29:44.741
and your sister
from a guy who buried me alive.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.535
So you say.
You also said your name was "Amy Adam,"

29:47.619 --> 29:50.955
which, come to think of it,
sounds really stupid.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.833
What, was "Britney Spear" already taken?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.298
If you had a brain,

30:01.049 --> 30:03.009
you could read
between the lines of your own script

30:03.092 --> 30:05.678
and see that you cracked the case.

30:06.554 --> 30:11.476
Hector, the hot sculptor boyfriend
who got jealous and killed Beck

30:11.559 --> 30:13.269
and framed Dr. Nicky?

30:14.521 --> 30:15.772
It’s Joe.

30:17.065 --> 30:21.694
Okay, so now if Dr. Nicky is so innocent,

30:21.778 --> 30:23.863
why don't you take your theory to him?

30:23.947 --> 30:24.948
I tried.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.575
He wouldn’t talk to me. No one will.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.912
You know, it’s a little hard
when everyone sees you as the crazy ex.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.330
Maybe ask yourself why that is.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.581
Oh, God.

30:33.790 --> 30:34.791
God!

30:35.166 --> 30:40.255
What is it about Joe fucking Goldberg?

30:40.547 --> 30:43.716
Why is it that no one can see him
for what he is?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.553
Careful. You're talking about my family.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.056
Huh.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.144
Don’t come crying to me
when he kills your sister.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.173
<i> One of those days,</i>

31:24.257 --> 31:27.635
<i>it seemed the sun</i>
<i>was in a rush to come down.</i>

31:27.719 --> 31:30.597
<i>Good thing.</i>
<i>With it comes the cover I need.</i>

31:31.180 --> 31:33.558
<i>No closer to knowing who killed Delilah.</i>

31:33.641 --> 31:36.519
<i>But I got to get her body off my hands.</i>

31:36.936 --> 31:38.563
<i>Only question is how.</i>

31:40.189 --> 31:43.234
<i>Not getting caught, that I can manage.</i>
<i>I've been here before.</i>

31:43.610 --> 31:46.321
<i>It’s Ellie. What is best for her?</i>

31:46.404 --> 31:48.531
<i>-That is what I promised her.</i>

31:48.615 --> 31:49.741
<i>Promised them both.</i>

31:49.824 --> 31:52.410
<i>-Is it better to know Delilah’s dead...</i>

31:52.493 --> 31:54.329
<i>...or always wonder?</i>

31:54.412 --> 31:56.998
<i>Which version of this is worse?</i>

31:58.291 --> 32:01.461
<i>Get Delilah’s phone fixed, man.</i>

32:01.544 --> 32:03.671
<i>Give Ellie a sister a little longer.</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:07.133
<i>She hears what she needs to</i>
<i>before losing Delilah forever,</i>

32:07.216 --> 32:08.927
<i>and the rest would be on us.</i>

32:09.010 --> 32:11.304
<i>If there can be an us.</i>

32:11.387 --> 32:14.933
<i>If I’m not the monster</i>
<i>who took Ellie’s sister,</i>

32:15.016 --> 32:16.768
<i>we could take care of Ellie.</i>

32:16.851 --> 32:18.061
<i>Be a family.</i>

32:18.144 --> 32:21.814
<i>That’s the best ending of all.</i>
<i>The one where love makes everything okay.</i>

32:27.487 --> 32:28.446
Delilah.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.782
It’s Amy.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.910
Will’s ex.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.832
Look, if you’re in there, open up,
all right?

32:43.544 --> 32:44.420
Fuck.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.576
<i>Amy Candace.</i>

33:16.869 --> 33:18.246
<i>I was just thinking.</i>

33:18.329 --> 33:22.417
<i>We never got to live out</i>
<i>our spectrophilia fantasy.</i>

33:22.500 --> 33:27.171
<i>Ours is a forbidden love,</i>
<i>but if I’m a ghost, right?</i>

33:27.588 --> 33:29.966
<i>I mean, I’ll be in and out,</i>
<i>and you won’t even know it.</i>

33:30.299 --> 33:32.677
<i>-I mean, you’ll definitely know it, but--</i>

33:32.760 --> 33:35.304
<i>Wait. Hold up! Hold up.</i>

33:36.305 --> 33:38.891
<i>Take this. Give it to Delilah.</i>

33:39.892 --> 33:42.937
<i>And when you fuck her, think of me.</i>

33:43.438 --> 33:46.441
<i>Promise? Anyway, so don't gho--</i>

33:55.575 --> 33:56.492
Delilah.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.500
I’m so sorry.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.298
I don’t know what happened to you,
and I want to know.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.218
I told you you would walk out of here.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.181
And I failed you.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.308
But Ellie will be okay.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.102
She will know you love her.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.729
And no matter what...

34:27.148 --> 34:28.983
I will never let her get hurt.

34:32.278 --> 34:36.032
-Back the fuck up!
-Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.701
Ah! Oh!

34:38.826 --> 34:41.871
I told you, Joe.
It was just a matter of time.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.956
This isn't what it looks like.
I didn’t do this.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.291
Oh, bunny.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.793
Your phone.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.669
-Now!
-Oh, shit!

34:48.753 --> 34:51.255
-Give me your phone, Joe.
-Okay, okay.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.840
-All right.
- Unlock it.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.468
- I can't fucking see.
-Now!

34:55.551 --> 34:56.427
Hang on.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.307
The police are never gonna believe you.

35:01.390 --> 35:04.393
You’re locked in a cage
with a dead body, Joe.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.687
I think they might believe me this time.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.358
What are you doing?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.401
What are you gonna do?

35:12.485 --> 35:15.113
Thought Love might like to come
and see what you’ve done.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.989
No, please! Candace...

35:17.657 --> 35:18.825
Candace, don’t do that.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.119
-Leave her out of this.
-You wish.

35:22.995 --> 35:26.707
Sucks to have someone pretend to be you,
doesn’t it, Joe?

35:43.057 --> 35:45.059
<i>If I killed this woman,</i>

35:46.644 --> 35:48.187
<i>then I deserve this.</i>

35:49.856 --> 35:54.360
<i>I thought I only ever acted</i>
<i>from a place of love.</i>

35:57.280 --> 35:58.197
<i>To protect.</i>

36:00.283 --> 36:02.034
- No!
-Stop!

36:02.910 --> 36:05.454
<i> But what type of man would do this?</i>

36:06.038 --> 36:08.666
<i> I'm gonna show you</i>
<i>who you really are.</i>

36:08.749 --> 36:11.752
<i> Has Candace been right all along?</i>

36:12.336 --> 36:14.839
<i>Have I been fooling myself?</i>

36:15.673 --> 36:20.720
<i>Have I just been refusing to face</i>
<i>who I really am?</i>

36:20.803 --> 36:22.763
-<i> Fucking lying!</i>
-<i> No!</i>

36:23.973 --> 36:25.433
Stop! You’re hurting me!

36:25.516 --> 36:28.102
-Get off of me!
- Fucking lying!

36:28.186 --> 36:29.729
- Stop!
-Tell me his fucking name!

36:29.812 --> 36:33.107
Get away from me!
Let go of me! You're crazy!

36:43.117 --> 36:44.911
<i> What am I?</i>

36:55.046 --> 36:56.380
What did you do?

36:56.464 --> 36:58.466
What did you do?

36:59.008 --> 37:00.760
You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.803
<i>You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.</i>

37:02.887 --> 37:04.722
<i>You shouldn’t have done that, Joey.</i>

37:04.972 --> 37:06.015
<i>What did you do?</i>

37:14.023 --> 37:15.816
- Love.
-What's going on?

37:23.532 --> 37:24.533
What did you do?

37:25.159 --> 37:27.203
Told you what he did to me,

37:27.286 --> 37:29.664
Beck, and God knows who else.

37:33.125 --> 37:36.170
You couldn’t believe me, so I proved it.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.090
Let him out of there.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.217
No.

37:42.802 --> 37:47.181
This asshole is going to be in a cage
for the rest of his life.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.188
Call the cops.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.150
I just wanted you to see it first.

37:58.734 --> 37:59.944
You're crazy.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.490
Tell her.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.577
Tell her you didn’t do this!

38:12.039 --> 38:13.249
I did.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.419
She’s right.

38:16.919 --> 38:19.839
Everything she said about what I did...

38:21.841 --> 38:22.758
is true.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.430
I’m sorry.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.308
You’re not crazy.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.354
I tried to kill her.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.733
I blamed it all on her.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.360
But that was a lie,

38:41.986 --> 38:43.571
like so many others.

38:47.783 --> 38:50.036
I thought I was doing it
for the best reasons,

38:50.411 --> 38:51.495
for love.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.955
But, Love...

38:53.789 --> 38:54.665
it wasn't.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.501
It was never really love.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.340
I never knew love until I met you.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.760
I would do anything for you.

39:06.385 --> 39:11.640
I just want to be good enough for you.

39:13.225 --> 39:17.897
I told myself that I could be different,
I could do it another way.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.315
But if that was true...

39:23.402 --> 39:24.987
Delilah wouldn't be...

39:27.198 --> 39:28.032
dead.

39:29.867 --> 39:33.496
I couldn't face the truth
because I didn’t want to lose you.

39:34.288 --> 39:35.664
I did this.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.959
She figured out I'd killed Henderson,

39:40.461 --> 39:41.712
and I killed her.

39:57.520 --> 40:02.066
<i> Is this how I was always</i>
<i>destined to end?</i>

40:02.733 --> 40:07.238
<i>Alone, unloved,</i>
<i>waiting for the police to arrive?</i>

40:07.488 --> 40:09.949
<i>Could things have gone any differently?</i>

40:10.950 --> 40:13.661
<i>If I’d walked</i>
<i>into a different bookstore...</i>

40:14.161 --> 40:17.164
-Who am I to you?
-You're an asshole.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.876
<i> One not run by a Soviet</i>
<i>prison guard.</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:24.797
<i>Or maybe...</i>
<i>if I’d had different parents...</i>

40:30.261 --> 40:32.638
Mom? Mommy?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.684
You were protecting me.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.397
It had to be done.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.316
You’re a good boy, Joey.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.362
Everything’s gonna be okay.

40:58.914 --> 41:01.667
Listen carefully to every word I say.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.545
You would never hurt anyone.

41:05.754 --> 41:06.922
And that's the truth.

41:07.756 --> 41:08.591
Never.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.551
Much less kill someone.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.053
No...

41:14.388 --> 41:15.473
You're a good boy.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.558
It was just an accident.

41:19.393 --> 41:22.021
A terrible... accident.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.524
Yeah. Yeah, okay?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.657
<i> I’m done with excuses.</i>

41:35.493 --> 41:40.331
<i>I'm done blaming everyone else</i>
<i>for the things I’ve done.</i>

41:44.710 --> 41:45.961
<i>I once told Beck,</i>

41:46.629 --> 41:49.590
<i>I learned a lesson</i>
<i>when Mooney locked me in.</i>

41:51.133 --> 41:53.260
<i>Hide a spare key.</i>

42:03.854 --> 42:05.606
Love! Hey!

42:06.190 --> 42:07.900
God, leave me alone!

42:08.484 --> 42:12.279
<i> So you can get out</i>
<i>of the goddamn cage.</i>

42:14.907 --> 42:15.950
Love.

42:18.118 --> 42:20.621
<i> But it’s time I take responsibility.</i>
