00:01.419 --> 00:04.053
YOU HEAR THAT?
SOMETHING'S GROWLING AT US.

00:04.055 --> 00:06.455
MAN, MY WHOLE BODY
IS SHAKING RIGHT NOW.

00:06.457 --> 00:07.989
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:07.991 --> 00:10.759
WHOA, A SHADOW JUST MOVED
IN TO THAT ROOM REALLY FAST.

00:12.396 --> 00:13.662
THERE'S SOMETHING
FOLLOWING ME.

00:13.664 --> 00:15.230
DO YOU FEEL HOW COLD
IT IS ALL A SUDDEN?

00:15.232 --> 00:17.532
THIS THINGS BEEN
FOLLOWING ME DOWN HERE.

00:17.534 --> 00:18.834
WHAT IS IT?

00:18.836 --> 00:20.002
Katrina: WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS DOWN HERE?

00:20.004 --> 00:21.970
I WANT TO TRY TO CONNECT
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:21.972 --> 00:23.138
KNOCK SOMETHING OVER.

00:24.374 --> 00:25.740
WHAT THE...

00:25.742 --> 00:26.941
YOU SURE
THAT'S SAFE TO DO?

00:26.943 --> 00:29.144
PROBABLY NOT.
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT.

00:29.146 --> 00:31.380
I'M KIND OF
TERRIFIED TO BE HERE.

BOBBY MACKEY'S MUSIC WORLD

01:19.964 --> 01:22.497
IN WILDER, KENTUCKY,
IS THE NATION'S

01:22.499 --> 01:26.835
NOTORIOUS MECCA FOR
PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.305
KATRINA WILL VISIT THE VENUE
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

01:30.307 --> 01:33.308
BUT NICK HAS HIS OWN
DARK HISTORY HERE.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.911
AFTER HIS LAST VISIT
SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

01:35.913 --> 01:38.313
SOMETHING UNHOLY
FOLLOWED HIM HOME,

01:38.315 --> 01:40.849
WREAKING HAVOC
ON HIS PERSONAL LIFE.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.652
HE SWORE HE WOULD NEVER RETURN.

01:43.654 --> 01:46.421
WHEN COUNTRY MUSIC LEGEND
BOBBY MACKEY

01:46.423 --> 01:49.191
PURCHASED THE PROPERTY IN 1978,

01:49.193 --> 01:53.595
HE WAS FULFILLING HIS DREAM
OF OWNING A COUNTRY MUSIC BAR,

01:53.597 --> 01:56.965
BUT WHEN THE HONKY TONK OPENED,
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT

01:56.967 --> 02:01.003
THE PREVIOUS SPIRIT TENANTS
WERE NEVER EVICTED.

02:01.005 --> 02:04.072
THE DARK HAUNTINGS
ARE THE STUFF OF LEGENDS.

02:04.074 --> 02:08.009
SHADOW FIGURES LURK ABOVE
THE STAGE, AND PHYSICALLY ATTACK

02:08.011 --> 02:10.478
PATRONS IN THE BACK CORNERS
OF THE CLUB.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.281
WHEN FORMER EMPLOYEE,
CARL LAWSON, DUG UP

02:13.283 --> 02:16.150
THE LONG-COVERED WELL
IN THE BASEMENT, UNDER THE BAR,

02:16.152 --> 02:19.354
HIS DEPRESSION AND RAGE
BECAME SO INTENSE,

02:19.356 --> 02:23.425
THAT A LOCAL PRIEST WAS
CALLED TO PERFORM AN EXORCISM.

02:23.427 --> 02:26.995
MOST BELIEVE THE HAUNTING
ORIGINATED IN 1896,

02:26.997 --> 02:29.464
WITH PEARL BRYAN,
WHO WAS BEHEADED

02:29.466 --> 02:31.133
BY HER BOYFRIEND, SCOTT JACKSON,

02:31.135 --> 02:35.003
AND A FRIEND, ALONZO WALLING,
AFTER A BOTCHED ABORTION.

02:35.005 --> 02:37.505
LEGEND HAS IT THAT
PEARL'S HEAD WAS THROWN

02:37.507 --> 02:39.975
DOWN THE WELL,
CASTING AN IMPENETRABLE

02:39.977 --> 02:41.977
DARKNESS OVER THE PROPERTY.

02:41.979 --> 02:46.648
WALLING AND JACKSON WERE HANGED
FOR THEIR CRIME NOT FAR AWAY.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.384
IN RECENT YEARS,
PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE

02:49.386 --> 02:51.253
RECEIVED WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE

02:51.255 --> 02:54.389
COMMUNICATION FROM PEARL
AND HER MURDERERS,

02:54.391 --> 02:58.260
AND SAY THAT HER GRISLY DEATH
HAS CHARGED THE AREA.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.463
BUT AS NICK AND KATRINA
DUG DEEPER, THEY FOUND THAT

03:01.465 --> 03:07.035
THE FACTS OF PEARL BRYAN'S DEATH
MAY CONFLICT WITH THE RUMORS.

03:07.037 --> 03:09.137
NOW, AS THEY PREPARE
TO LOCK THEMSELVES

03:09.139 --> 03:12.741
INSIDE BOBBY MACKEY'S
MUSIC WORLD FOR 72 HOURS,

03:12.743 --> 03:14.676
THEY MUST SIFT THROUGH
THE LEGENDS

03:14.678 --> 03:19.381
AND FIND THE TRUE ORIGINS
OF THE INFAMOUSLY DARK HAUNTING.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.418
Nick: I'VE BEEN TO
BOBBY MACKEY'S MUSIC WORLD

03:23.420 --> 03:26.021
HERE IN WILDER, KENTUCKY,
MULTIPLE TIMES.

03:26.023 --> 03:28.090
AND WHAT'S SCARY ABOUT
THIS LOCATION IS

03:28.092 --> 03:29.825
ALL THESE LEGENDS,
THESE GHOST STORIES,

03:29.827 --> 03:32.493
THESE PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES,
PEOPLE HAVING EXPERIENCES,

03:32.495 --> 03:35.764
VERY DARK, NEGATIVE HAUNTINGS
THAT NOT ONLY HAPPENS

03:35.766 --> 03:37.699
IN THE LOCATION,
BUT FOLLOWS YOU HOME.

03:37.701 --> 03:39.501
I'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

03:39.503 --> 03:41.236
IT'S BEEN REALLY
HARD TO SHAKE OFF.

03:41.238 --> 03:42.503
Katrina: YEAH.

03:42.505 --> 03:44.439
THAT NEGATIVITY,
AND JUST THAT FEELING OF DREAD.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.376
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PEARL BRYAN
HAUNTING THE LOCATIONS.

03:47.378 --> 03:50.178
ALL THESE GHOST STORIES THAT
I'VE HEARD ABOUT BOBBY MACKEY'S,

03:50.180 --> 03:54.383
AND I'VE EXPERIENCED, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS WHAT WAS HERE.

03:54.385 --> 03:56.617
MM-HMM, THESE STORIES
HAVE BEEN TOLD

03:56.619 --> 03:58.987
SO MANY TIMES
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.189
BUT THESE ARE THE
STORIES THAT I'VE HEARD,

04:01.191 --> 04:02.924
AND THEY'RE PRESENTED
AS FACT.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.060
THEY'RE GETTING NAMES
OF THESE PEOPLE,

04:05.062 --> 04:07.062
THEY'RE CALLING OUT
TO THESE PEOPLE,

04:07.064 --> 04:08.329
THEY'RE GETTING ATTACKED,

04:08.331 --> 04:10.065
AND EVERYTHING I'VE EVER HEARD
ABOUT THIS PLACE,

04:10.067 --> 04:12.334
IT'S VERY, VERY DARK,
VERY HEAVY ENERGY.

04:12.336 --> 04:16.204
IF NONE OF IT'S TRUE,
AS FAR AS BEING CONNECTED

04:16.206 --> 04:21.676
TO BOBBY MACKEY'S, THEN WHAT'S
THE GENESIS OF THE HAUNTING?

04:21.678 --> 04:24.012
WHAT STARTED IT,
AND WHY IS IT SO NEGATIVE?

04:24.014 --> 04:26.781
WE'RE GONNA GO MEET KEN,
FROM THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

04:26.783 --> 04:28.750
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO HIM
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF ALL

04:28.752 --> 04:31.353
THESE LEGENDS AND STORIES
AND TRY TO GET TO THE FACTS.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.755
KEN REIS IS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE COLUMBUS COUNTY

04:33.757 --> 04:36.224
HISTORICAL SOCIETY,
AND HE'S DONE EXTENSIVE

04:36.226 --> 04:38.160
RESEARCH ON
THE MURDER OF PEARL BRYAN,

04:38.162 --> 04:40.896
SO IF ANYBODY KNOWS
THE TRUTH ABOUT

04:40.898 --> 04:43.098
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED,
IT WOULD BE KEN.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.167
WE ALWAYS HEARD THE STORY THAT
THE HEAD WAS FOUND IN THE WELL.

04:46.169 --> 04:48.669
-IT WAS NEVER FOUND.
-SO IT WAS NEVER, EVER FOUND?

04:48.671 --> 04:49.971
THE HEAD
JUST NEVER WAS FOUND

04:49.973 --> 04:51.773
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT THEY HAVE

04:51.775 --> 04:52.975
ANY IDEA
WHERE IT WENT TO.

04:52.977 --> 04:54.842
SO ANYBODY WHO SAYS THAT,
ITS BASICALLY

04:54.844 --> 04:56.577
AN URBAN LEGEND,
THAT THEY'RE JUST REPEATING?

04:56.579 --> 04:57.979
IT'S AN URBAN LEGEND,
YES.

04:57.981 --> 04:59.514
SO BOBBY MACKEY'S IS HERE.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.516
BOBBY MACKEY'S WOULD BE
RIGHT THERE.

05:01.518 --> 05:04.386
SHE WAS MURDERED IN FORT THOMAS,
IN THE DISTRICT OF HIGHLANDS.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.854
OH, YEAH.

05:05.856 --> 05:07.589
IT WAS EVENTUALLY CALLED,
FORT THOMAS.

05:07.591 --> 05:09.524
IT'S A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY,
AND THE HANGINGS

05:09.526 --> 05:11.793
DIDN'T EVEN TAKE PLACE
NEAR THAT LOCATION, EITHER.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.661
NO, THAT WAS DOWN
IN THE CITY OF NEWPORT,

05:13.663 --> 05:16.131
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ROUGHLY SIX MILES AWAY.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.799
THERE'S NO HISTORY
OR CONNECTION BACK TO THERE?

05:17.801 --> 05:20.469
YES, YES, SHE WAS MURDERED
IN FORT THOMAS.

05:20.471 --> 05:22.404
JUST SPEAKING WITH KEN
AND KNOWING THAT THE

05:22.406 --> 05:25.073
RESEARCH THAT KATRINA
AND I HAVE DONE IS ACCURATE,

05:25.075 --> 05:28.009
THERE'S NO CONNECTION
TO THE PEARL BRYAN MURDER CASE,

05:28.011 --> 05:30.945
AND THE LOCATION
OF BOBBY MACKEY'S MUSIC WORLD.

05:30.947 --> 05:34.282
I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
THAT THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED.

05:34.284 --> 05:37.285
IF IT'S NOT SCOTT JACKSON,
ALONZO WALLING,

05:37.287 --> 05:38.486
OR EVEN PEARL BRYAN,

05:38.488 --> 05:41.089
THEN WHAT IS IT?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.291
HERE'S THE SIGN
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

05:43.293 --> 05:45.359
"WARNING TO OUR PATRONS,
THIS ESTABLISHMENT

05:45.361 --> 05:47.228
IS REPORTED TO BE HAUNTED.

05:47.230 --> 05:50.766
MANAGEMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
AND CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE

05:50.768 --> 05:54.569
FOR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY GHOSTS,
SPIRITS, ON THIS PREMISES."

05:54.571 --> 05:57.105
I HAVE SUCH A WEIRD
FEELING BEING BACK IN HERE.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.306
FEELS SUFFOCATING.

05:58.308 --> 05:59.975
IT'S HEAVY, RIGHT?

05:59.977 --> 06:03.645
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE,
LIKE IF SOMEBODY'S...

06:03.647 --> 06:05.514
OH, LIKE STRANGLING,
GEEZ.

06:05.516 --> 06:07.716
NOT STRANGLING,
BECAUSE IT'S HERE.

06:07.718 --> 06:08.650
IN YOUR CHEST?

06:08.652 --> 06:09.851
IN MY CHEST,
BUT IT'S LIKE

06:09.853 --> 06:11.920
IF SOMEBODY PUTS
A WEIGHT ON YOUR CHEST.

06:11.922 --> 06:14.055
YOU OKAY?

06:14.057 --> 06:19.361
I'M FINE,
BUT IT WAS VERY IMMEDIATE.

06:19.363 --> 06:20.862
Katrina: WE'RE MEETING BOBBY
AND HIS WIFE, DENISE,

06:20.864 --> 06:22.663
WHO OWNED BOBBY MACKEY'S
MUSIC WORLD.

06:22.665 --> 06:24.732
BOBBY IS DEFINITELY
THE MORE SKEPTICAL,

06:24.734 --> 06:28.136
WHERE DENISE HAS ALWAYS HAD
PARANORMAL EXPERIENCES HERE.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.839
SHE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVES IT,
SO NICK AND I ARE GONNA

06:30.841 --> 06:33.608
GO TALK TO THEM
TO KIND OF FEEL OUT

06:33.610 --> 06:36.511
WHERE IN THE BUILDING
SEEM TO BE THE HOT SPOTS.

06:36.513 --> 06:38.946
IT FEELS INCREDIBLE
TO BE BACK HERE.

06:38.948 --> 06:41.816
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THOSE THINGS,
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE BACK.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.818
AND I SAID, I NEVER WANT TO
COME BACK IN HERE

06:43.820 --> 06:46.087
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,
BUT HERE I AM.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.289
WE'VE HAD A GOOD FRIENDSHIP
FOR YEARS --

06:47.291 --> 06:49.624
-YES, WE HAVE.
-AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.425
Katrina: SO I HAVE DEFINITELY
HAVE HEARD ALL THE STORIES,

06:51.427 --> 06:53.628
BUT WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE
ME BACK TO THE BEGINNING

06:53.630 --> 06:55.564
BECAUSE THIS IS
MY FIRST TIME HERE.

06:55.566 --> 07:01.970
I OPENED UP HERE IN 1978,
SEPTEMBER THE 8TH, 1978.

07:01.972 --> 07:05.040
AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT RIDE,
HEARD LOTS OF STORIES

07:05.042 --> 07:07.676
FROM PEOPLE
ABOUT THE PARANORMAL.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.445
I NEVER WAS ONE TO BELIEVE
IN THAT SORT OF THING.

07:10.447 --> 07:12.647
-RIGHT.
-I STILL DON'T, WE LIKE TO SAY,

07:12.649 --> 07:14.449
COME FOR THE GHOSTS,
AND STAY FOR THE MUSIC.

07:14.451 --> 07:15.783
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

07:15.785 --> 07:16.984
WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE PLACE,
DID YOU FEEL

07:16.986 --> 07:18.119
COMPELLED TO BUY IT,
OR WAS IT JUST --

07:18.121 --> 07:20.388
ALMOST.
[ CHUCKLES ] YEAH.

07:20.390 --> 07:21.656
DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT WAS
SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE

07:21.658 --> 07:23.858
A HIGHER POWER TELLING YOU,
"BOBBY, THIS IS YOUR PLACE?"

07:23.860 --> 07:25.527
I FELT LIKE
I'D BEEN IN HERE BEFORE.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.730
I FELT LIKE I KNEW
WHAT WAS IN HERE.

07:28.732 --> 07:31.166
I THOUGHT, I NEED THIS PLACE,
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS PLACE

07:31.168 --> 07:35.470
WORK AS A COUNTRY MUSIC PLACE,
AND 39 YEARS LATER...

07:35.472 --> 07:38.540
WOW, THIS LOCATION
JUST HAS SO MUCH HISTORY.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.276
IT HAS A REPUTATION
OF AMAZING MUSIC, OBVIOUSLY,

07:41.278 --> 07:43.678
YOU, YOUR NAME,
AND THEN IT HAS THIS REPUTATION

07:43.680 --> 07:45.947
OF BEING EXTREMELY HAUNTED,
LIKE I'VE BEEN TELLING

07:45.949 --> 07:48.616
KATRINA, IT'S HAD CRAZY
AFFECTS ON ME, WHEN I'VE LEFT

07:48.618 --> 07:50.418
THE COUPLE OF TIMES
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.353
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING
THAT WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS,

07:52.355 --> 07:55.489
WHAT IS HAUNTING
THIS LOCATION?

07:55.491 --> 07:57.025
THAT'S PROBABLY MY BIGGEST
QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS,

07:57.027 --> 07:59.694
SINCE I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE,
I'VE JUST HEARD THE STORIES

07:59.696 --> 08:02.030
FROM EVERY SINGLE
PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR,

08:02.032 --> 08:03.798
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
IS HERE?

08:03.800 --> 08:06.635
WELL, DENISE BELIEVES
MORE THAN I DO,

08:06.637 --> 08:09.370
SHE'S JUST
A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON.

08:09.372 --> 08:10.839
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO
WALK AROUND WITH YOU

08:10.841 --> 08:12.474
AND TALK MORE ABOUT
THE PARANORMAL STUFF.

08:12.476 --> 08:14.109
-YEAH.
-GREAT, WE'LL DO THAT.

08:14.111 --> 08:17.579
-WE'LL FOLLOW YOU.
-ALL RIGHT.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.848
I'VE INVESTIGATED BOBBY MACKEY'S
MUSIC WORLD IN THE PAST,

08:20.850 --> 08:23.985
AND WHEN I LEFT, I REALLY HAD
A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE.

08:23.987 --> 08:26.655
AND I HAD TO COME BACK
TO FACE IT.

08:26.657 --> 08:29.324
BOBBY TAKES US UPSTAIRS
TO CARL LAWSON'S ROOM.

08:29.326 --> 08:31.593
CARL AND I WERE FRIENDS,
AND TALKED ABOUT HIS OWN

08:31.595 --> 08:33.728
DARK EXPERIENCES
IN THE BASEMENT.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.097
HE PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO.

08:36.099 --> 08:42.437
♪♪

08:42.439 --> 08:44.739
Denise: THIS IS WHERE CARL
STAYED FOR SEVERAL YEARS

08:44.741 --> 08:47.008
WHEN HE WAS WORKING
FOR BOBBY AND TAKING CARE OF

08:47.010 --> 08:50.278
THE MAINTENANCE
AND STUFF IN THE BUILDING.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.613
Katrina: YEAH.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.813
Nick: DO YOU COME
UP HERE AT ALL?

08:52.815 --> 08:55.016
ONLY IF I ABSOLUTELY
HAVE TO.

08:55.018 --> 08:56.351
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING NEGATIVE UP HERE?

08:56.353 --> 08:58.486
MM-HMM, YEP, REALLY DARK, YEAH.
OH, REALLY?

08:58.488 --> 09:00.355
CARL'S BED
WAS RIGHT OVER HERE.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.889
ON THAT SIDE?

09:01.891 --> 09:06.695
YEAH, COMING OUT THIS WAY,
AND HE SLEPT WITH A SHOTGUN,

09:06.697 --> 09:12.500
HE BARRED THIS DOOR SHUT,
AND SLEPT WITH A SHOTGUN.

09:12.502 --> 09:14.970
Katrina: WHY DID HE SLEEP
WITH A SHOTGUN?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.504
HE JUST HAD A SHOTGUN
IN THE BED WITH HIM.

09:16.506 --> 09:18.572
FOR PEOPLE OR FOR GHOSTS?

09:18.574 --> 09:19.774
WHO KNOWS.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.242
ALL OF THE ABOVE,
I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW.
