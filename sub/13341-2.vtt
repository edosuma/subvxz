WEBVTT

01:02.000 --> 01:04.542
Hannah:
Baby.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.625
Coffee.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.542
Hot coffee.
Come on.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.625
Wake up, okay?

01:11.625 --> 01:13.750
We got to go get Jessa.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.375
- Adam?
- Yes?

01:15.375 --> 01:17.041
We have to go
and get Jessa.

01:17.041 --> 01:18.417
She's not done
with rehab.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.041
Yeah, well, we have
to pick up Shoshanna,

01:20.041 --> 01:23.083
we have to rent a car,
which I can't do because
I'm 24 years old,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.667
so it's time to wake up.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.166
Do you hear me?

01:27.166 --> 01:30.333
- Come on.
- ( groans )

01:31.250 --> 01:33.500
It's not fun
for me.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.250
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- ( groans )

01:37.250 --> 01:38.834
Are you okay?

01:38.834 --> 01:40.500
( singing with radio )
♪ Try to tell you no ♪

01:40.500 --> 01:43.750
♪ But my body keeps on
telling you yes ♪

01:43.750 --> 01:45.333

01:45.333 --> 01:49.166

so out of breath... ♪

01:49.166 --> 01:50.708
It doesn't even
make sense.

01:50.708 --> 01:54.166
♪ Waking up in the morning
probably hating myself... ♪

01:54.166 --> 01:55.834
I sound just like him.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.542

02:01.542 --> 02:03.500
( music stops )

02:13.542 --> 02:16.041
I hope Jessa's at least,
like, appreciative.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.208
She should be.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.500
We are really
giving of ourselves,

02:18.500 --> 02:20.166
being, like, models
of female friendship.

02:20.166 --> 02:24.208
And giving up so much
valuable writing time
all for her good.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.792
This isn't for my health.

02:25.792 --> 02:28.166
Adam:
That's bullshit.

02:28.166 --> 02:31.250
- Excuse me?
- You're not doing her any good
by taking her out of rehab.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.000
But she said it was time
for her to go.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.166
Oh, wow.
When was the last time
an addict lied?

02:37.166 --> 02:38.542
Oh, my God,
that's so true.

02:38.542 --> 02:39.792
They totally lie.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.917
My friend Rachel
is fully addicted
to blueberry Red Bull,

02:41.917 --> 02:44.083
and she always tells me
that she hasn't had one,

02:44.083 --> 02:45.917
but she tells me, like,
with a blue tongue.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.625
I just don't really think
you understand the nature
of female friendship.

02:48.625 --> 02:50.083
You're right, I don't.
And I don't want to

02:50.083 --> 02:53.625
if it involves ignoring
all logic and being
totally hysterical.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.792
Well, you're not really there
for your friends in any way.

02:55.792 --> 02:58.333
I mean, come to think of it,
like when Chad busted open
his knee...

02:58.333 --> 02:59.875
I couldn't get involved
because it was under

02:59.875 --> 03:01.500
very illegal and illicit
circumstances.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.458
- Okay.
- I mean, Adam was
there for you

03:03.458 --> 03:05.000
when you went
totally batshit insane

03:05.000 --> 03:08.166
and decided to cut
your hair like a little boy
on a fancy cookie box.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.041
I just think
that women get stuck
in this, like,

03:10.041 --> 03:12.834
vortex of
guilt and jealousy
with each other

03:12.834 --> 03:15.583
that keep them from seeing
situations clearly.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.417
"Women get stuck"?

03:17.417 --> 03:19.000
Okay, now you sound like
one of those guys

03:19.000 --> 03:20.792
who thinks a woman
should never be president

03:20.792 --> 03:23.417
because her menstruation
will cloud her judgment.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.250
But they shouldn't,
like, be president

03:25.250 --> 03:28.708
because it could--
their-- their judgment.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.583
Okay, well, Jessa
wants to leave.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.208
Well, you can't always
get what you want.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.834
But if you try
sometimes,

03:33.834 --> 03:37.625
you just might
find you...

03:37.625 --> 03:40.000
- ( snickers )
- ...get what you need.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.959
( laughs )

03:41.959 --> 03:44.041
What's funny?

03:44.959 --> 03:47.291
( sniffs )

03:49.291 --> 03:50.417
I thought
you'd gone already.

03:50.417 --> 03:53.750
I was thrown in a room
without any human contact--

03:53.750 --> 03:55.959
no food, no water--
for hours.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.417
Why didn't
you come rescue me?

03:57.417 --> 03:59.959
Role-playing is not
my forte, my love.

03:59.959 --> 04:02.208
I was in fucking solitary.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.625
But they can't outsmart me.
There was no lock on the door.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.583
- ( laughs )
- Stupid fucks.

04:06.583 --> 04:11.291
But truth be told,
I'd sort of like to be
in jail for a day, you know?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.708
It's this feeling
you really can't simulate.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.291
Poor thing.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.166
You're too young
to understand

04:17.166 --> 04:19.208
which thoughts
are useless to you.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.583
All right.

04:20.583 --> 04:22.041
When you're older,
your mind learns

04:22.041 --> 04:24.000
to let go of things
that don't suit you.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.083
You start to live
with the same ignorance
as the very young.

04:28.083 --> 04:31.166
Of course, being young
is terrifying as well.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.834
You have all
of the knowledge,
but none of the language

04:33.834 --> 04:37.834
to dissuade yourself
from the horrible truths
of the world.

04:37.834 --> 04:41.291
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel the utmost sympathy
for my daughter.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.250
I did everything I could
to make the world

04:43.250 --> 04:46.125
a less gargantuan
place for her.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.667
You don't
even talk to her.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.000
That's just
one of the ways
that I protect her.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.542
That makes sense.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.500
( music playing )

04:56.500 --> 04:58.208
What's your
favorite utensil?

04:58.208 --> 05:00.625
Um...

05:00.625 --> 05:03.542
my favorite utensil is...

05:05.875 --> 05:07.500
I never thought about it.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.000
Wait, seriously?
That's, like, insane.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.625
Like, what if you
had to pick?

05:11.625 --> 05:14.542
I guess a fork.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.041
Okay, that is crazy.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.667
Like, why would you want
cold metal prongs stabbing
you in the tongue

05:18.667 --> 05:20.500
when instead
you could have your food
delivered into your mouth

05:20.500 --> 05:23.291
on, like, a cool,
soft, pillowy cloud?

05:25.417 --> 05:27.375
What did you just say?

05:27.375 --> 05:29.542
How was it?

05:29.542 --> 05:31.959
It was fine. I saw
some Raggedy Ann dolls.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.875
So, what do you
want to eat?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.333
Uh, what are
you guys getting?

05:35.333 --> 05:38.917
Biscuits and gravy
and chicken fried steak.

05:38.917 --> 05:40.291
Well, they don't list
their calories here,

05:40.291 --> 05:42.250
so, A, I'm not eating,
and, B, that is illegal.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.583
I'm really, really
not hungry,

05:43.583 --> 05:46.917
so maybe you can
just order me pancakes
and turkey bacon.

05:46.917 --> 05:48.375
And then I guess if they
don't have turkey bacon,

05:48.375 --> 05:51.750
I'll have regular
bacon and a milk shake.
Thank you.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.708
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.291
I highly doubt
they have turkey bacon.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.417
If they have turkey bacon,
I would be shocked.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.083
Holla, koala.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.125
Hey.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.625
Mom, don't you think
that's a bit much?

06:02.625 --> 06:04.792
This place
smells like kimchi.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.250
Yeah, well, now
it smells like a Sephora.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.792
Well, what would
you rather have,
kimchi or a Sephora?

06:08.792 --> 06:11.583
Yo, where you at?
You wanna come see
my new place?

06:11.583 --> 06:14.083
My mom is here
and she's helping me a ton.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.375
Oh, my God, I would love to,
but I'm actually, um...

06:16.375 --> 06:19.291
I am up in Woodstock with Adam
'cause we're doing this,
like, couples getaway

06:19.291 --> 06:21.625
to just, you know,
relax and recharge.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.959
Charlie and I used to
do stuff like that
all the time.

06:23.959 --> 06:27.875
Do not utter his name.
Just saying his name
gives him power.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.250
I'm picking Jessa up
from rehab.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.583
All of us are,
Adam and Shoshanna and me.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.917
Wait, so you lied to me?

06:34.917 --> 06:36.417
For one second.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.458
- Give me the phone.
- I lied to you one second
ago for a second

06:38.458 --> 06:40.583
and then I took it
back a second later.
That doesn't even count.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.959
Yeah, but you were
gonna lie to me.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.458
What, you don't think
I can handle it, Hannah?

06:43.458 --> 06:44.542
That's not it.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.500
By the way, why are you
even picking Jessa up?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.917
- Doesn't she have,
like, a magic carpet?
- ( laughs )

06:48.917 --> 06:50.375
Uh, just 'cause
that's the rules of rehab.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.708
She needs somebody to sign
a paper for her so she can go.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.542
Well, since when does Jessa
follow the rules?

06:54.542 --> 06:57.041
And by the way,
since when is Jessa
even a drug addict?

06:57.041 --> 06:58.333
She's, like,
a life addict.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.834
I gotta be honest.
I'm feeling pretty
left out right now.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.959
Oh, I hate that, baby.
Oh.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.291
Am I on speakerphone?

07:06.291 --> 07:09.583
- No.
- Hi, Hannah.
How are you?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.583
Hi, Evie.
How's it going?

07:11.583 --> 07:14.083
Marnie, are you saying
you actually would have
wanted to come?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.583
Oh, my God, no.
Of course not.

07:15.583 --> 07:16.834
I just didn't want
anyone to go.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.583
Okay, that makes sense.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.583
You know what?
You guys need to
work this out.

07:20.583 --> 07:23.583
And, Hannah, you got
to come over and see
Marnie's new shitbox.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.667
Mom.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.250
I'm, like,
unrelentingly itchy.
Is that a road trip thing?

07:28.250 --> 07:30.041
What do you have
the rocking chair for?

07:30.041 --> 07:32.333
Uh, I wasn't hungry,
so I bought a souvenir.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.125
It's a rustic souvenir.
It was, like, $14.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.708
My friend Zeva
has always wanted one.

07:36.708 --> 07:40.708
She is going to freak
when she sees that I have one.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.542
Do you think the donut's
gonna help my nausea

07:52.542 --> 07:54.375
or do you think
it's gonna hurt it?

07:55.917 --> 07:57.208
I had to take
my seat belt off.

07:57.208 --> 07:59.625
It smells like
straight ketchup.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.917
I'm so bored.
Are you guys so bored?

08:04.917 --> 08:06.208
Boredom is bullshit.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.875
Boredom is for lazy
people who have
no imagination.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.000
I will never be bored
as long as there's Halloween.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.708
I hate Halloween.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.125
This road trip
is just so unremarkable.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.708
You know what I mean?
It's just so similar
to other road trips

08:19.708 --> 08:22.083
that I've seen in,
I don't know, various media.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.291
It's like a Don Henley song.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.417
What were you expecting?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.125
Something I could
write about in my book.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.792
I mean, we're picking
our friend up from rehab

08:28.792 --> 08:31.583
and I just thought
there'd be something I could
write about in my book.

08:31.583 --> 08:32.917
That seems like
a very rich area,

08:32.917 --> 08:35.542
but I'm just realizing
that this road trip
is not a metaphor.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.082
It just isn't.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.582
And this rocking chair
is so pointy.

08:41.582 --> 08:44.250
It's not giving me
any room to express myself.

08:49.417 --> 08:50.917
My head's caught.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.583
- ( TV playing )
- ( laughing )

08:55.792 --> 08:57.250
( laughing )

08:57.250 --> 09:00.834
- Can you turn the TV off?
- What?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.792
Oh, me?

09:04.792 --> 09:05.834
Oh, yeah,
no, it's fine.

09:05.834 --> 09:08.500
I've totally seen this one
a bunch anyways.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.208
Can you shut
your computer down
now, please?

09:13.875 --> 09:16.333
What?

09:16.333 --> 09:20.250
Can you shut
your computer down
now, please?

09:20.250 --> 09:21.875
I'm trying to finish
five pages today

09:21.875 --> 09:24.041
so I can stay on schedule
for my publisher, okay?

09:24.041 --> 09:25.834
You're always typing
on your computer.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.917
Yeah, that's 'cause
this trip is kind of
a kink in my schedule

09:27.917 --> 09:30.542
- and I need--
- Do you guys want to
play Truth or Dare?

09:31.708 --> 09:33.667
- How do you play?
- Um...

09:33.667 --> 09:34.875
( chuckles )

09:34.875 --> 09:36.959
You've never played
Truth or Dare?

09:36.959 --> 09:40.375
Well, I'm aware
that there's a game
that's called that.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.834
Truth or Dare is one
of the most fun games
in the world.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.333
( laughs )

09:46.333 --> 09:49.166
And it's the game
that teaches children
how to behave like adults.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.458
- Okay.
- I was playing Truth or Dare
the first time I got fingered.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.917
Okay, do not,
like, share a bunch
of really good truths

09:53.917 --> 09:55.000
before we even
start the game.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.708
That's, like,
really wasteful.
Okay, so...

09:56.708 --> 10:00.291
I say, "Truth or Dare,"
right?

10:00.291 --> 10:03.583
And you have to pick,
uh, truth or dare.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.458
- Okay.
- But you have to do it.

10:05.458 --> 10:08.625
Otherwise, like--
you have to.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.333
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.250
- Okay, truth or dare?
- Dare.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.750
Okay, um...

10:13.750 --> 10:18.500
okay, I dare you
to go to the ice machine--

10:18.500 --> 10:21.083
no, okay--
no, no, no, okay.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.750
I dare you-- okay, no.

10:23.750 --> 10:27.542
I dare you to kiss...

10:28.875 --> 10:31.500
Hannah.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
Okay, that is
an incredibly lame dare

10:34.500 --> 10:36.750
because that is already
my boyfriend and we kiss
all the time.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.917
- Ah.
- Yeah, you did it!
You did it!

10:39.917 --> 10:43.500
- It's your first dare!
- That doesn't feel good.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.792
Here, just watch
us play, okay?

10:44.792 --> 10:46.250
- Watch us play.
- Okay, we're gonna do it.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.000
- We're just gonna show you.
- We're gonna do a thing.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.291
- Truth or dare?
- Okay, truth.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.708
Okay, what is
the most upsetting thought--

10:51.708 --> 10:53.917
Wait, don't make it,
like, too--

10:53.917 --> 10:56.333
- like, I want a truth--
- Okay, bedtime.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.708
Night time.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.500
Um, so...

11:01.500 --> 11:03.333
bed is now?

11:03.333 --> 11:04.542
Adam: Yeah.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.959
Good night, Shosh.
Let's play in the car
tomorrow.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.750
Yeah, okay.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.083
Okay.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.375
Thank you very much
for coming.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.750
You really didn't have
to and I know that--

11:17.750 --> 11:20.291
I'm pissed
that we can't fuck.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.542
Okay, but we're in the room
with another person, so...

11:23.542 --> 11:26.250
Yeah, well,
I just can't sleep well
if I don't come.

11:26.250 --> 11:30.083
Hannah:
When we get home, it is
gonna be a come parade.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.166
- Ahem.
- Adam: I wanna come now.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.667
You know what?
You do that.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.917
You do that.
You just-- you do it,

11:37.917 --> 11:39.417
and I'm gonna go.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.667
And I'll come back
whenever the come parade

11:41.667 --> 11:44.250
has, like, paraded on by.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.291
Why are you
being so grumpy?

11:46.291 --> 11:47.750
I'm not being grumpy.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.625
Are you gonna
be nicer to me?

11:50.625 --> 11:52.125
I'm gonna try.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.625
Are you gonna turn
your mood around?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.041
I'm gonna try.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.458
I can do it.
I'm gonna do it.

11:56.458 --> 12:00.708
- Are you gonna turn
that frown upside down?
- I'm gonna do it.

12:26.917 --> 12:30.458
( bag rustling )

12:34.333 --> 12:37.041
Shosh, you can
come back, okay?

12:37.041 --> 12:39.834
We finished.
Adam just has
to towel off.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.000
Oh, my God.
Is that Chex Mix?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.458
- Yeah, I'm allergic.
- Thank you.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.000
Did you have fun sex?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.792
I don't know.
Maybe now he'll
actually let me sleep.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.667
Um, do you think
Adam's right?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.667
About there being
no value in watching
sitcoms?

12:55.667 --> 12:56.959
No, he's insane.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.375
No, about the fact
that we're not really
helping Jessa

12:59.375 --> 13:02.834
by retrieving her from rehab
when she needs to be there.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.291
I don't know. I wasn't
really aware that she had
a problem until just now.

13:06.291 --> 13:08.625
Like, she's so pretty
and guys love her

13:08.625 --> 13:10.083
and she doesn't
even really want a job,

13:10.083 --> 13:12.500
so, like, she really has
nothing to worry about.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.417
You think Jessa has
nothing to worry about?

13:14.417 --> 13:16.375
Mm-mm, I lived with her
for, like, a year.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.041
She's as easy
as they come.

13:18.041 --> 13:21.708
What about all
the binge drinking
and the heavy drug use?

13:21.708 --> 13:23.208
She just
does that for fun.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.875
Shosh, she got divorced,
like, seven months ago.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.792
And, like, earned
a bunch of money from it.

13:27.792 --> 13:28.875
Like, that's
totally fun.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.291
And before that,
the trail of broken affairs

13:32.291 --> 13:34.291
and the fact that
she's now in rehab.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.542
Uh, yeah,
like, totally cool.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.625
It's, like, a rite of
passage for celebrities.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.208
She probably has already
met Ryan "Phil-ee-pay"

13:41.208 --> 13:42.875
and they're
probably engaged.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.500
By the way, it's "Phil-a-pee."
I heard it on "Extra."

13:45.500 --> 13:47.125
It's definitely
"Phil-ee-pay."

13:47.125 --> 13:49.333
It's 100%
"Phil-a-pee."

13:49.333 --> 13:51.917
I mean, I read
his autobiography,
so I think I would know.

13:51.917 --> 13:55.375
Whatever, Jessa
is no bowl of fucking
cherries, okay?

13:55.375 --> 13:58.041
I know that she
is beautiful and glamorous,

13:58.041 --> 14:01.458
but she has a deep well
of sadness inside her

14:01.458 --> 14:03.291
that most people
don't detect.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.750
And I didn't even
know about it in college
because all she did

14:05.750 --> 14:08.875
was dance on the quad
in rain boots and a bikini

14:08.875 --> 14:10.125
and, like, juggle knives,

14:10.125 --> 14:12.125
and then one day,
she got really sick.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.000
She goes to
the student health center.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.417
Turns out to be
a kidney infection.

14:16.417 --> 14:17.792
So a bunch of us
go over to her room

14:17.792 --> 14:20.708
to bring her, like,
magazines and snacks

14:20.708 --> 14:22.542
and, you know,
donut holes and shit,

14:22.542 --> 14:25.208
and we're all talking
and she's telling great stories.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.542
She looks like Ava Gardner.
She doesn't look sick at all.

14:27.542 --> 14:30.125
Then we say we have to go
to class 'cause it's finals.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.417
She's, like,
begging us to stay.

14:32.417 --> 14:35.917
I was like,
"Dude, I've got to go.
I have finals."

14:35.917 --> 14:37.708
As I'm closing the door,

14:37.708 --> 14:39.875
I see that
she's just crying

14:39.875 --> 14:43.792
'cause that's how badly
she doesn't want to be
left alone.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.500
That's, like,
a really sad story,

14:46.500 --> 14:48.708
but I think
you're probably
remembering it wrong.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.792
Like, you were
probably the one
who was crying.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.917
I'm really happy that
she's gonna be home
for graduation.

14:54.917 --> 14:57.250
Like, I really want
her in my photos.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.625
Are you nervous
about graduation?

14:58.625 --> 14:59.834
Oh, my God.
Not at all.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.458
Like, whatever I do,
it'll be better
than school.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.458
Uh, I hate
to break it to you,

15:04.458 --> 15:06.333
but school
is the best gig
you'll ever have.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.792
I mean, your job
is basically just
to be yourself.

15:09.792 --> 15:13.125
That's why I
apply to grad school
every single year.

15:13.125 --> 15:15.291
Honestly, the only people
that I ever hear say that

15:15.291 --> 15:18.000
are people who don't
make any money.

15:24.834 --> 15:28.333
Oh, Adam, you were right.
It's such a beautiful country.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.500
Hannah:
I mean, no wonder
truckers do cocaine.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.667
This is boring as hell.

15:36.667 --> 15:40.083
Can we turn the air off?
I feel very nauseous.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.375
What are you doing?

15:44.375 --> 15:47.000
- What are you doing?
- Hiking.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.834
Uh, no, 'cause we
have to pick Jessa up.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.458
She's not
going anywhere.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.959
You want something
to write about, well,
here it is.

15:57.959 --> 16:01.125
The glory of God
is all around us, Hannah.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.708
Trees, frogs,
birdy-birds.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.458
What is wrong with people?

16:06.458 --> 16:08.708
Look how fun this is!

16:16.417 --> 16:17.667
I hate this!

16:17.667 --> 16:20.208
My friend Rachel
saw a guy giving a girl

16:20.208 --> 16:26.542
full-on cunnilingus
on a hike just like this
on a day just like this.

16:26.542 --> 16:29.500
No! No!
Come on, kid, let's go.
You can do it.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.208
Yeah, but you
know what, Adam?

16:31.208 --> 16:32.792
I don't want to do it.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.875
And it's really liberating
to say no to shit you hate.

16:36.875 --> 16:40.375
So you go ahead.
You live your truth.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.583
I'll be here
living my truth.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.458
Okay.

16:48.458 --> 16:51.500
Or we could all
just go back to the car!

16:51.500 --> 16:52.750
Adam:
See you in a bit!

16:52.750 --> 16:55.333
Hannah:
But I have no stick!

16:58.583 --> 17:01.500
Shosh?

17:01.500 --> 17:03.792
Ray's third worst scenario
in life-- thank you--

17:03.792 --> 17:06.375
is a road trip
with a spontaneous detour.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.625
Who has a third
worst anything?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.708
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.916
I don't catalogue my mind.
It's unhealthy.

17:12.916 --> 17:16.916
Adam, you are, like,
so dementedly helpful.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.250
Okay, cool.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.666
No, like, you seem
like you genuinely
like helping people.

17:21.666 --> 17:25.791
Hannah needs so much
and you give and give
and give like a saint.

17:25.791 --> 17:27.333
- It goes both ways.
- No, okay, I'm serious.

17:27.333 --> 17:30.125
Think about it. What would
she have done during this
period of mental unrest

17:30.125 --> 17:33.333
if her boyfriend had been,
like, an actual human being
existing in society?

17:33.333 --> 17:35.625
What if you had, like,
a job or responsibilities

17:35.625 --> 17:39.458
or places to be
during the day like
her best friend?

17:43.583 --> 17:45.917
She is my best friend.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.625
Oh, my God.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.834
Ira Glass on iPhone:
It's not always so clear
what the best way is

17:54.834 --> 17:57.458
to help somebody without
unintended consequences,

17:57.458 --> 17:59.583
either the people
being helped

17:59.583 --> 18:01.792
or the people
doing the helping.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.625
We have two stories today,

18:03.625 --> 18:06.750
including a sheriff
who was trying to do right

18:06.750 --> 18:08.834
by marijuana growers.

18:08.834 --> 18:11.667
From WBEZ Chicago,
it's "This American Life."

18:15.917 --> 18:17.875
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.333
How was group?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.834
Who confessed to what?
Who screamed at who?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.083
- Tell me everything.
- Yeah.

18:22.083 --> 18:25.500
- That girl
with the tramp stamp...
- Yeah, yeah.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.166
...told us she slept
with her brother-in-law.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.667
Boring or what?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.375
Yeah, I could've
told you that.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.875
Truth be told,
Jessamyn,

18:32.875 --> 18:36.000
I've been
pants-shittingly scared

18:36.000 --> 18:38.583
that you'd
departed already

18:38.583 --> 18:40.458
before we'd had
the chance

18:40.458 --> 18:43.166
to properly fuck.

18:43.166 --> 18:46.041
Wait, we were never
going to fuck.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.750
Oh, yeah, we were
always gonna fuck.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.041
We decided that
the moment we met, babe.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.500
The moment we met,
if I recall,

18:52.500 --> 18:56.750
I was being held down
in a chair by a woman
named Frank.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.625
Right, and we shared
a look, right? Remember?

18:59.625 --> 19:02.083
A look in which
I communicated,

19:02.083 --> 19:03.542
"Are we gonna fuck?"

19:03.542 --> 19:06.542
And your look
responded, "Yes,
we are gonna fuck."

19:06.542 --> 19:10.333
Oh, my God.
You were almost
charming until now.

19:10.333 --> 19:14.542
That was before my bag
of stash ran out.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.583
What stash?

19:16.583 --> 19:20.959
Percs, Vics, Klonies.
The usual suspects.

19:20.959 --> 19:24.250
At my age, group
is almost unbearable

19:24.250 --> 19:27.000
unless you have
something to smooth out

19:27.000 --> 19:28.417
the jagged little edges

19:28.417 --> 19:32.375
and the nattering
fucking chitchat.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.708
I've got one
Adderall left.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.417
There we go, my baby.

19:36.417 --> 19:39.250
- ( drawer shuts )
- ( Jasper sighs )

19:58.917 --> 20:02.917
You can have a seat.
This'll take a minute.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.708
Well, can I
walk around?

20:06.708 --> 20:09.000
Well, maybe not
right here.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.375
It's annoying to me.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.125
- Which one's your sister?
- Her.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.125
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.166
You understand your sister
has been removed

20:41.166 --> 20:43.834
from our program
for various offenses,

20:43.834 --> 20:45.792
including fraternizing

20:45.792 --> 20:48.542
and distributing a zine

20:48.542 --> 20:50.583
of provocative cartoons.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.083
What's fraternizing?

20:52.083 --> 20:55.291
- I joined a frat.
- Intense sexualized
socializing.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.583
Okay.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.125
Can I get my pot back,
please?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.125
- You want your pot back?
- Yeah.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.041
Sure, I just need
to check with the police

21:03.041 --> 21:04.834
and make sure
they're okay with that.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.417
( scoffs )
Whatever. Fine.

21:06.417 --> 21:09.750
We believe that Jessa
would benefit from
additional treatment,

21:09.750 --> 21:11.917
but we can't
keep her here.

21:11.917 --> 21:15.667
I totally get it.
Let me just sign the waiver
and we'll get out of here.

21:15.667 --> 21:18.333
There's nothing to sign.
We have an open-door policy.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.458
But she told me
that there was something
that I needed to sign

21:20.458 --> 21:21.750
so I could come get her.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.166
No, we offered to drive her
to the airport,

21:23.166 --> 21:25.667
but she said you were
coming here for her.

21:25.667 --> 21:28.458
There's an airport?

21:28.458 --> 21:31.333
It's a very small one.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.458
There's an airport?

21:35.458 --> 21:38.041
( groans )

21:42.041 --> 21:44.625
Hannah:
I think it's really fucked up
that you lied to me,

21:44.625 --> 21:47.875
and I think it's
even more fucked up
how you left me, okay?

21:47.875 --> 21:50.875
At your father's house
with no way to get home.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.875
I had to catch a ride
to the train station

21:52.875 --> 21:55.083
from a pregnant teen.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.333
She was in labor.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.041
And then I took the train
home by myself

21:58.041 --> 22:00.166
and I felt
like a huge loser.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.208
And it made me remember
what it was like in college

22:02.208 --> 22:05.083
when you'd say,
"Oh, meet me at the Free
Palestine party."

22:05.083 --> 22:07.375
Then I'd find out you're
over at the Israel house.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.375
And so I just
wish you would get it

22:09.375 --> 22:13.667
that this is not okay
behavior for a friend.

22:13.667 --> 22:17.125
Okay, listen, it was
all weird back then.

22:17.125 --> 22:20.083
None of it was on purpose.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.542
Okay.

22:21.542 --> 22:24.667
And your hair
looks fantastic.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.959
You know what?
Thank you,

22:25.959 --> 22:29.750
but this haircut
happened upon me in
a very challenging time

22:29.750 --> 22:31.625
that you weren't
present for.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.667
I feel very glad
you like it

22:33.667 --> 22:37.250
because every single
morning when I wake up,
I question it.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.333
Okay.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.667
What-- why--
what is-- why?

22:45.667 --> 22:49.250
- What is all this?
- I just missed you so much.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.417
I missed you.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.834
And I would
really like it if you
would please stop leaving

22:56.834 --> 23:01.166
'cause I'm really
looking forward to you
being around more.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.917
So, please--

23:02.917 --> 23:05.083
- just please, please.
- Okay, I will. I am.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.417
I'm-- I am done
with all that.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.834
Okay, 'cause I hate it.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.959
I hate it.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.875
Okay.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.583
Okay.

23:19.583 --> 23:23.208
Let's get out of
this fucking nunnery.
