00:10.178 --> 00:14.015
<i>NARRATOR".
A typically beautiful day in Gotham City.</i>

00:14.182 --> 00:20.104
<i>But the return of a dastardly duo
and their deadly dragoons.</i> ..

00:20.271 --> 00:22.941
<i>...bodes darkening clouds.</i>

00:24.484 --> 00:27.070
- Let me help you cross, ma'am.
-Why thank you, sonny.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.365
- Look out, ma'am!
-Oh! Oh!

00:32.116 --> 00:34.369
I can't believe my eyes, sonny.

00:34.536 --> 00:37.038
That looks like a band of Cossacks.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.831
Yes, ma'am, it does.

00:38.998 --> 00:42.168
Olga, Olga, wait for me.

00:42.335 --> 00:43.878
Wait for me, Olga.

00:44.045 --> 00:48.550
I do believe that's Egghead,
the notorious arch-criminal.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.427
But why is he riding that burro?

00:51.594 --> 00:54.722
What are those Cossacks doing
in Gotham City?

00:54.889 --> 00:59.561
<i>NARRATOR". Good questions, indeed.
And the ominous answers are not far away.</i>

01:01.145 --> 01:03.147
<i>At the Gotham City Museum...</i>

01:04.524 --> 01:10.738
- Wait a minute, what's going on here?
-Oh, is nothing going on, my little piroshki.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.825
Nothing to worry your head about.

01:13.992 --> 01:16.286
Come back here, you.

01:16.578 --> 01:18.204
You can't do this.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.168
Is there...

01:24.335 --> 01:28.256
...Silver Scimitar of Taras Bulbul.

01:28.423 --> 01:35.054
Never to be pulled out except by rightful heir
to throne of Bessarovian Cossacks.

01:35.346 --> 01:38.683
By me, Queen Olga...

01:38.850 --> 01:41.561
...legitimate ruler of Bessarovian Cossacks.

01:41.728 --> 01:44.314
You'll never get away with this,
you scoundrel!

01:44.480 --> 01:49.152
Shh. This is a museum. Quiet, please.

01:49.319 --> 01:50.361
Olga?

01:50.528 --> 01:55.116
Olga, you could at least give me a horse.
I can't keep up with you.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.868
I'm eggs-hausted.

01:57.035 --> 02:01.706
Only Bessarovian Cossacks are riding horses,
darling. All others are having burros.

02:01.873 --> 02:04.626
All right, all right.
As long as you remember our bargain.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.086
I am remembering, darling.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.714
Silver Scimitar for me...

02:09.881 --> 02:12.383
...golden egg for you.
-Heh, heh.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.012
Imperial queen is ready.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:32.111 --> 02:33.571
Is done.

02:33.738 --> 02:39.577
I, Olga, am possessor
of Silver Scimitar of Taras Bulbul.

02:39.744 --> 02:44.957
And I, Egghead, am possessor
of the solid gold egg. Unh!

02:45.750 --> 02:48.920
Now let's get out of here fast
before the Gotham City cops arrive.

02:49.087 --> 02:51.756
Oh, do not worry about cops, darling.

02:51.923 --> 02:55.593
My Cossacks are making cops-burgers
from them if they buttinsky.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.597
Fine, fine, but let's get out of here anyway.

03:05.812 --> 03:09.357
The Egg of Ogg and the Bulbul Scimitar?

03:10.108 --> 03:12.610
We'll get on it at once.

03:14.779 --> 03:18.032
The Bulbul Scimitar? The Egg of Ogg?

03:18.199 --> 03:22.078
That's right, Chief O'Hara. A frightening theft
from the Gotham City Museum.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.665
But what makes it even more frightening
is who perpetrated it.

03:25.915 --> 03:26.999
From all descriptions...

03:27.166 --> 03:31.087
...apparently Olga, Egghead,
and that band of Bessarovian Cossacks.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.507
Begorra. I thought Egghead
was behind bars...

03:34.674 --> 03:37.927
...and the Bessarovians had been
sent back to Bessarovia.

03:38.094 --> 03:40.012
Bessarovia didn't want the Bessarovians.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.099
And Egghead's out on a legal technicality.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.518
There's only one person who can help us.

03:45.685 --> 03:47.353
Batman.

03:48.271 --> 03:51.816
Oh, but I can hardly bring myself
to call him again.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.068
- Want me to call him?
-No, no, no. Wait, wait.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.572
Give me a moment
to summon my strength and courage.

03:57.739 --> 04:02.493
For if ever strength and courage were needed
in Gotham City, Chief O'Hara...

04:03.035 --> 04:04.495
...it's needed now.

05:30.081 --> 05:33.042
Gosh, Bruce, that Genghis Khan
was quite a guy.

05:33.209 --> 05:36.921
In the 13th century, he and his Mongol armies
almost conquered Europe.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.298
Yes, Dick, the Mongols are fierce warriors.

05:39.465 --> 05:42.677
Even today you can find pockets of them
scattered throughout Asia.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.682
<i>- I'll</i> get it, sir.
- Thank you.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.560
One moment, commissioner.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.729
Excuse me, sir, but Commissioner Gordon
wishes to speak to you...

05:53.896 --> 05:56.816
...about certain pockets of criminal activity
in Gotham City.

05:56.983 --> 05:59.193
Thank you, Alfred. Yes, commissioner?

06:00.444 --> 06:05.533
The Bulbul Scimitar and the Egg of Ogg?

06:07.451 --> 06:08.619
I see.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.621
<i>We'll be right down.</i>

06:12.623 --> 06:14.500
To the Batpoles.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.633
There's no doubt it was Egghead,
Olga, and the Cossacks?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.636
- None.
-Galloping through the streets they were too.

06:25.803 --> 06:30.474
My department's had a dozen calls reporting
a band of horsemen on the loose again.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.269
- Holy Tartars.
-Unholy Tartars, Robin.

06:33.436 --> 06:37.231
Stealing scimitars and golden eggs
from a museum is one thing...

06:37.398 --> 06:41.819
...but when the average citizen on the street is
in peril, something must be done and quickly.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.947
Like rounding the interlopers up
and shipping them out.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.825
Ha, ha. That's just it. Nobody wants them.

06:47.992 --> 06:49.994
Still, they have no diplomatic immunity...

06:50.161 --> 06:53.331
...from the laws of this city,
this state and this country.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.416
Gosh, no, and Egghead doesn't either.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.753
He's a very stupid man,
compounding all his felonies.

06:58.920 --> 07:03.174
Women like Olga have been the downfall
of far wiser men than Egghead, commissioner.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.718
No, the invasion was just the beginning...

07:05.885 --> 07:09.013
...of the new nefarious plan
of pilfer and plunder...

07:09.180 --> 07:14.560
...involving, no doubt,
more egg targets of some kind.

07:14.727 --> 07:18.356
We'll make a list of every egg target left
in Gotham City, Batman.

07:18.522 --> 07:22.693
<i>NARRATOR". But while the dynamic duo
are organizing their defense...</i>

07:22.860 --> 07:25.363
<i>ALL".
Hey, hey, hey!</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:36.207
Oh, must they make so much noise, Olga?
I can't hear myself think.

07:36.374 --> 07:39.919
It is victory celebration, Eggski.

07:40.086 --> 07:45.466
Cossack without victory dance
is like egg without salt.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.803
Well, that hits me where I live. Heh, heh.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.680
Well, let them dance.

07:50.846 --> 07:56.352
There'll be bigger victories than this,
and soon eggs-quisite victories. Heh, heh.

07:58.229 --> 08:02.775
- You have plans, Eggski?
-Big plans, Olga, big plans.

08:02.942 --> 08:06.362
The Scimitar of Taras Bulbul,
the golden Egg of Ogg...

08:06.529 --> 08:09.365
...are only the beginning
of a series of dastardly plans...

08:09.532 --> 08:13.119
...that will leave Gotham City
begging for mercy.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.204
Mercy! Ha!

08:15.746 --> 08:20.751
- My Cossacks are not giving mercy.
-No, of course not. Mm.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.756
You lovely, evil woman, not a drop of mercy.
Heh,heh,heh.

08:28.426 --> 08:32.179
You are heartless, hairless man.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.515
I'm liking you more and more.

08:34.682 --> 08:39.061
Oh, and I you, Olga. I, you.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.063
Our meeting was destiny.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.482
- And after we're married, Olga, we--
-Ah.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.110
Hold horses, Eggski.

08:46.277 --> 08:49.947
I told you before,
no marriage without dowry.

08:50.114 --> 08:53.576
But why do you think I'm planning
all of these crimes for us, Olga?

08:53.743 --> 08:55.953
No, the loot will be your dowry...

08:56.120 --> 08:58.497
...and then we can be properly married.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.000
I must have big dowry.

09:01.167 --> 09:05.629
- Dowry fit for queen, imperatritsa.
-And you will, Olga.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.591
You will, yes.

09:08.758 --> 09:15.473
Yes, the series of crimes that I am planning
will net you the largest dowry in history.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.808
What is next crime?

09:18.142 --> 09:23.689
We're heisting a certain vault
full of dehydrated roe.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.859
Row? As in boat?

09:27.026 --> 09:31.655
No, no. Roe as in fish egg.
And fish egg as in caviar.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.659
And caviar as in a certain special
cold-storage vault...

09:35.826 --> 09:37.244
...at the Gotham City bank.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.831
Yes, a shipment of 500 pounds.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.835
It was a gift from the czar of Samarqand
to the people of Gotham City.

09:45.002 --> 09:49.173
And it's worth $200 an ounce.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.510
You won't have lunch with me, Daddy?

09:52.676 --> 09:56.764
I only wish I could, darling, but Gotham City
is in too much danger right now...

09:56.931 --> 09:59.642
...for the police commissioner
to take a leisurely lunch...

09:59.809 --> 10:02.061
...much as I'd like to.
-Danger?

10:02.228 --> 10:06.232
Incredible as it sounds,
there is a band of Bessarovian Cossacks...

10:06.398 --> 10:09.485
...loose in Gotham City.
-You mean again?

10:09.652 --> 10:12.613
They're back? That's incredible.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.366
But true, sad to say.

10:15.533 --> 10:19.203
If the dynamic duo weren't helping us,
I don't know what I'd do.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.664
This is just between you and me, of course.

10:21.831 --> 10:26.168
Now, I don't want it to spread,
or there might be panic in the streets.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.255
Don't worry. I only wish
there was something I could do to help.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.299
There is something you can do.
You can help...

10:32.633 --> 10:36.887
...by going straight home
and staying out of trouble.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.265
Okay. I'll go straight home.

10:48.107 --> 10:52.278
But this is no time for me to stay out of trouble
or off the streets. Right, Charlie?

10:52.444 --> 10:56.073
However, I will change clothes
before I go out again.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.950
Come on, keep me company.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.420
But you mustn't tell anyone
what you see in here.

11:18.554 --> 11:23.434
<i>NARRATOR". As Barbara Gordon makes
her astonishing change into Batgirl...</i>

11:25.060 --> 11:29.106
<i>...and heads out on her own
to prevent panic in the streets...</i>

11:29.273 --> 11:31.942
<i>...the Caped Crusaders are not idle.</i>

11:32.109 --> 11:34.695
"The Lo Hung Company,
makers of egg drop soup...

11:34.862 --> 11:39.325
Canes Candy Company,
manufacturers of chocolate Easter eggs."

11:39.491 --> 11:41.535
Well, that's the last of them, Robin.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.039
We've alerted every company
in Gotham City...

11:45.206 --> 11:48.000
...that's even remotely connected with eggs.

11:48.167 --> 11:52.129
You think Olga and Egghead might be
planning some crime not connected with eggs?

11:52.296 --> 11:57.176
I doubt it, Robin. Like all criminals, Egghead
follows a particular predictable pattern.

11:57.343 --> 12:02.223
But although we know the pattern,
we don't know the particular crime.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.309
We also don't know what part
Olga and her Cossacks will play.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.769
Quite true, Robin.

12:06.936 --> 12:10.189
And I've been racking my brains trying to--

12:10.731 --> 12:12.483
Wait a minute.

12:12.775 --> 12:17.112
What country is located next to Bessarovia?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.490
- Samarqand, I think.
-Correct.

12:19.657 --> 12:22.326
And both countries lie quite close
to the Black Sea.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.245
What do you know about the Black Sea?

12:24.411 --> 12:29.583
Well, it's famous for its sturgeon,
its caviar-- Caviar!

12:29.750 --> 12:31.752
Right. Caviar, fish eggs.

12:31.919 --> 12:36.215
And the king of Samarqand
recently sent a gift of 500 pounds...

12:36.382 --> 12:38.884
...of dehydrated royal caviar to Gotham City.

12:39.051 --> 12:42.263
What's Gotham City gonna do
with 500 pounds of dehydrated caviar?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.640
No one could decide. So it's being stored...

12:44.807 --> 12:49.103
...in a specially-cooled vault
at the Gotham National Bank.

12:49.270 --> 12:53.357
- And it's worth $200 an ounce. So...
-So?

12:53.524 --> 12:54.858
Let's go.

12:59.738 --> 13:03.033
Now that we've moved most of our cash
to our upstate branch...

13:03.200 --> 13:04.868
...I feel much better.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.664
With Egghead in town, no bank is safe.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.167
What's that?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.504
The Cossacks!

13:15.671 --> 13:18.757
<i>Do not</i> draw <i>revolver, little shmyerdski...</i>

13:18.924 --> 13:21.719
...or I am having Ossip bash you to beatniks.

13:21.885 --> 13:26.557
Ossip, remove revolver
from little shmyerdski.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.102
You are head man here?

13:30.269 --> 13:35.774
Yes, and you might as well turn right around
and go back where you came from.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.068
There's no money in that vault.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.655
But we will make look-see anyway, no?

13:41.822 --> 13:47.411
Ha. Go ahead.
We shipped all of our money upstate.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.163
Ha, ha.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.665
Perhaps we're not coming for money.

13:51.957 --> 13:56.378
Ha, ha, ha. There's nothing else in there.

13:56.545 --> 13:59.965
Ha,ha,ha,ha.

14:00.132 --> 14:03.385
Perhaps you are forgetting the caviar?

14:04.762 --> 14:06.430
Good heavens, the caviar!

14:06.597 --> 14:14.188
Old Cossack saying:
Do not make "ha" before eggs are safe. Hm?

14:14.355 --> 14:18.025
Inside. Snatch the caviar
and make fast goodbye.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.501
Whoa!

14:36.251 --> 14:37.336
Egghead!

14:37.503 --> 14:41.757
Who did you expect, Batman?
Where are Olga and her Cossacks? Eggs-plain.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.634
Oh, you're late.

14:43.801 --> 14:47.638
They've already left with my caviar.

14:47.805 --> 14:51.225
Why won't that woman slow down?
I'll never catch up with her.

14:51.392 --> 14:54.603
Shoot him! He's in league
with that Cossack gang.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.023
Oh, no, no. Don't shoot, please.

14:58.816 --> 15:02.319
<i>NARRATOR". At least Batgirl's found
a one-man panic in the streets.</i>

15:02.486 --> 15:05.531
Oh, protect me, Batgirl.
That monster is going to shoot me.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.700
Not so brave
when your henchmen aren't around, are you?

15:08.867 --> 15:11.328
Oh, I never claimed to be brave, Batgirl.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.665
No, I'm clever and crafty,
but I'm a complete coward.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.667
You won't let him shoot me?

15:17.084 --> 15:20.754
That depends. Where are the Cossacks
you've been running around with?

15:20.921 --> 15:23.465
Oh, they're gone, Batgirl.
They left before I came.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.511
- Left for where, Egghead?
-I don't know.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.096
No?

15:29.263 --> 15:32.558
Well, they did mention
their destination, but you see...

15:32.724 --> 15:35.894
...they speak Bessarovian
and I don't speak the language.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.481
Perhaps there are some other languages
you do know, Egghead.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.942
The language spoken by that guard's gun.

15:42.109 --> 15:46.071
Oh, no. Oh, please, you can't ask me
to rat on my friends.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.866
Oh, yes, I can.
And you'd better start ratting fast.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.536
Do you expect me,
a respected arch-criminal...

15:52.703 --> 15:57.332
...to fink on my friends
like a common stool pigeon?

15:57.499 --> 15:59.251
Of course.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.213
- All right, I'll do it.
-Let's go.

16:03.380 --> 16:07.801
Oh, but it make take us some time.
You see, my burro is kind of slow.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.055
Forget your burro. Get on the back
of my Batgirl cycle and show me your hideout.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.976
On that thing?
But I might be eggs-tinguished.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.811
All right, then stay here.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.564
But I won't be responsible
for any stray bullets...

16:20.731 --> 16:23.400
...that just might happen your way.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.110
No, wait for me.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.779
Two blocks down and to the left.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.126
Oh, Batman, thank heaven you're here.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.920
The royal caviar has been stolen...

16:43.086 --> 16:45.756
...by that mad Bessarovian queen
and her henchmen.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.592
I was afraid we might be too late.
Where's Egghead?

16:48.759 --> 16:53.096
He arrived just after they left.
We were about to shoot-- I mean, arrest him...

16:53.263 --> 16:57.267
...when Batgirl drove up and convinced him
to take her to his hideaway.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.270
- The Cossacks.
-Exactly, Robin.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.941
Batgirl is a match
for any gang of ordinary hoodlums...

17:04.107 --> 17:07.778
...but for a wild band
of Bessarovian Cossacks...

17:07.944 --> 17:11.698
...even her extraordinary abilities
might not be enough.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.617
Let's go. We have to find
that hideout before she does.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.579
They went down that street
and to the left, Batman.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.248
Thank you, sir.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.175
Oh. Oh.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.928
Well, this is it, Batgirl.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.514
We're going in there, Egghead,
and no funny business.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.808
Oh, you can trust me, Batgirl.

17:37.975 --> 17:41.019
I'd sooner trust a snake
with fangs at both ends.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.480
- Mush now.
-Yes.

17:53.615 --> 17:57.452
Here we are, Batgirl.
The hideout is through that door.

17:57.619 --> 18:01.415
Good. Then open the door and announce me,
Egghead. And no tricks.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.666
Tricks?

18:02.833 --> 18:07.963
Oh, Batgirl, how could you suspect me
of trying to trick you?

18:09.047 --> 18:10.340
Hm.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.846
I love caviar.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.598
No testing.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.520
Olga, Olga, my dear.

18:23.687 --> 18:26.898
We have a visitor. Batgirl.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.192
Ah.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.532
Very funny.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.534
What is this joking, Eggski?

18:37.701 --> 18:40.662
Olga, my little bride-to-be,
she was here not two seconds ago.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.123
I brought her here
so that we could ambush her.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.543
The ambush is
on the other foot now, Egghead.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.588
You tricked me.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.366
<i>And now,</i> my <i>little pipkin...</i>

19:17.783 --> 19:20.327
...you will do for us saber dance...

19:20.744 --> 19:23.163
...with frosted swords.

19:27.626 --> 19:28.752
Dance it, yeah!

19:47.896 --> 19:49.940
She's good dancer, Eggski.

19:50.107 --> 19:53.443
Yes, she's dancing to her grave.
Ha, ha, ha.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.986
Naturally.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.292
There it is, Batman.

20:09.459 --> 20:14.631
Yes, Robin. It's fortunate that the turbo engine
on her cycle uses a radioactive spark plug...

20:14.798 --> 20:18.719
...so that we were able to trace it here
with our Bat-geiger Counter.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.305
We move carefully, Robin...

20:22.472 --> 20:25.767
...so that we'll be able
to take them by surprise.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.551
Now it's your turn to face the music, Olga.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.512
Very sad we meet at funeral.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.515
Your funeral, Batman.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.102
I believe you overestimate
your undertaking abilities, Egghead.

21:09.519 --> 21:13.356
My Cossacks, hack them to shashliks.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.223
Give them one for me, Batman.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.559
Eggski, up from there.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.395
Oh, but I might be hurt, Olga.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.610
- You come with me, my little mousenik.
-Ah!

21:59.319 --> 22:01.154
- Grab her.
-Yes.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.864
Ah! Unh!

22:03.031 --> 22:05.033
We are drowning her in caviar.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.833
- Drowning her in caviar.
-Bye, Batgirl.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.671
Come on, go!

22:22.592 --> 22:24.427
Help, Batman!

22:24.594 --> 22:26.096
I'm drowning! Unh!

22:27.180 --> 22:28.723
I'm also freezing!

22:29.099 --> 22:31.852
Batgirl's being frozen in that caviar.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.399
There she is.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.862
Batgirl, I'll untie you.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.114
Thank you, Batman.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.454
They almost turned me
into a human hors d'oeuvre.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.331
What a chilling way to die.

22:53.498 --> 22:57.752
Holy cold creeps. Leave it to crooks like them
to think of a trick like this.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.546
Yes, that's to be expected, Robin.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.757
The concept of decency
is alien to the criminal mind.

23:06.428 --> 23:09.139
And thanks to me, they've escaped.

23:09.514 --> 23:13.685
Perhaps crime-fighting is better left
to the men, Batgirl.

23:14.311 --> 23:15.478
Perhaps not.

23:15.645 --> 23:18.523
But this isn't exactly women's work.

23:18.690 --> 23:23.278
- But I'm no ordinary woman, Batman.
-Agreed.

23:23.653 --> 23:27.365
At least we've recovered
the dehydrated royal caviar.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.998
It's lucky you had me surround
that building once more, Batman.

23:35.165 --> 23:38.209
Olga and Egghead ran
right into the paddy wagon again.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.670
Only this time, they didn't want to.
Heh, heh.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.757
- Forewarned is forearmed, Chief O'Hara.
- That's true, Batman.

23:43.924 --> 23:47.218
I'm sure they won't find caviar
on the menu at Gotham State Prison.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.430
Probably not,
but they will get a well-balanced diet...

23:50.597 --> 23:53.892
...thanks to Warden Crichton's emphasis
on proper nutrition.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.563
What is it, Barbara?

23:58.730 --> 24:01.483
I just saw the strangest-looking car outside.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.360
It was sort of greenish-gold...

24:03.526 --> 24:06.446
...and had what looked like whiskers
on its front fenders.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.657
A car with whiskers?

24:08.823 --> 24:11.201
Sounds like Catwoman's Kitty Car
to me, Batman.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.453
Catwoman was driving it.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.332
And if I'm not mistaken, that arch-criminal
the Joker was a passenger.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.669
- Holy here we go again, Batman.
-I'm afraid you're right, old churn.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.837
If Catwoman and Joker have joined forces...

24:23.004 --> 24:25.882
...it sounds like there's trouble
right here in Gotham City.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.592
<i>NARRATOR".
And how right he is.</i>

24:27.759 --> 24:29.511
<i>Trouble in a green fright wig.</i>

24:29.678 --> 24:31.638
<i>Trouble in a car with whiskers.</i>

24:31.805 --> 24:35.183
<i>More trouble than the Caped Crusaders
have ever known.</i>

24:35.350 --> 24:38.311
<i>Coming up on our next episode.</i>
