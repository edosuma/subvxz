00:54.400 --> 00:58.800
Welcome to the University
of Ithaca. This is it, right here.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.400
I'm gonna give you a good tour today.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.300
Show you as much as you need to know.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.300
This is the main area
of the university.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.800
You'll be getting used to this area.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
This is sort of where you congregate.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.600
Come in around me. Keep close.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.900
I've had problems
with stragglers before, OK?

01:19.200 --> 01:22.200
They get lost in the back
and hit by trucks, OK?

01:22.400 --> 01:26.200
It's not pretty. This is the...

01:26.500 --> 01:31.400
By the way, this is the Joseph
H Nelson Memorial Library here, OK?

01:31.700 --> 01:35.100
It was built, uh...
It was built, uh, in the 1600s.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.900
1600s? It says 1951.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.400
That's the address. OK? Wise-ass.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.600
That's the psychology department.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.600
You're expected to volunteer for
cutting-edge experimental testing.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.500
Kind of cool.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.000
When it's your turn, remember
to wear loose clothes, no metal,

02:03.400 --> 02:07.900
and be prepared to receive several
heavy doses of electric current.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.300
They're watching us right now.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.300
Over there
is the department of English.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.100
Most of you speak English already
so we can skip that.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.000
- How long have you been here?
- Eight years.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.900
You don't seem to know anything.
This is the worst tour ever.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.900
It's the worst school ever.
Doesn't anything cool happen?

02:35.200 --> 02:36.900
Yeah, cool stuff happens.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.500
This university
is the coolest place in the world.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.800
That's because
he's never been anywhere else.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.000
Go ahead, laugh all you want.

02:50.200 --> 02:55.500
But the fact is, this is the setting
for the greatest story ever told.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.300
OK?

02:57.500 --> 03:01.400
It's about this guy I knew,
Josh Parker,

03:01.700 --> 03:03.700
and his girlfriend, Tiffany.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.000
It's one of the most
fascinating journeys ever.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.900
'Josh and Tiffany
were always together,

03:12.200 --> 03:14.800
'starting from when they were little.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.900
'They did everything as a team.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.500
'When Tiffany was 10,
she had her tonsils taken out.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.800
'Josh stayed in the hospital
for three days.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.900
'They were best friends.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.400
'What started out as friendship...

03:30.700 --> 03:35.900
'blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.900
'They spent so much time together
that even their dogs started dating.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.100
'They seemed destined
to be together forever.

03:46.400 --> 03:51.700
'But after high school, they faced
the most challenging challenge ever -

03:52.000 --> 03:54.300
'a long-distance relationship.

03:56.200 --> 04:01.700
'See, while Josh was enrolled here at
the wonderful University of Ithaca,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.100
'Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.900
'But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

04:10.200 --> 04:14.300
'to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship. '

04:14.800 --> 04:20.000
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them ever imagined.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.300
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.100
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.400
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on!

04:30.600 --> 04:34.300
Seriously! I had to take
two birth control pills today.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.100
You wanna help me study
again tonight?

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
Forget tonight. Come over now.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.600
Let's blow this class off.

05:12.500 --> 05:17.200
'Tiffany and Carla can't come to the
phone but please leave a message. '

05:17.500 --> 05:20.200
Hey, Tif, it's me... again.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.600
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still trying to get hold of you.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.200
Everything's cool, though.
I'll catch you later.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
Call me back, OK? OK. Bye.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.300
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.400
I haven't talked to you
in a few days and...

05:43.600 --> 05:46.300
I'm thinking you don't like me...
I'm kidding.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.300
Hey, guys.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.700
But I am getting a little worried so
gimme a call when you get a chance.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.500
Barry says hi.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.700
So gimme a call
as soon as you can. I miss you.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.300
Call me, OK? Bye.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
- What's up, guys?
- Not much. You?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I was just finishing my tape to Tif.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.600
Mitch, what are you doing?
Are you hungry? Huh?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.600
- You gonna feed him?
- No, I'm checking the temperature.

06:21.900 --> 06:26.000
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.200
Can I drop a mouse in?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.800
Mitch only eats once a week,
on Saturdays.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.100
Maybe we could cut a mouse in half,

06:36.400 --> 06:40.100
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.600
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now?

06:43.900 --> 06:46.900
What time is it? Oh, shit!

06:47.100 --> 06:50.500
Do me a favour -
when this is rewound, mail it for me?

06:50.700 --> 06:53.600
- No problem. Leave it there.
- Thanks, man.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.200
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.000
Can we please feed him now?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
No. If you overfeed him he could die.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.500
So? It'll be worth it.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.100
- Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.300
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.600
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.500
Studying. I'm starting
to question this college thing.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
There's so much reading.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.700
- Right.
- Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.200
- You going to EL's tonight?
- Yeah.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.400
I gotta run,
class has started.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.300
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.900
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.400
- It's not your business, Jacob.
- I can tell.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.400
- I'm not having this conversation.
- What conversation?

07:49.700 --> 07:52.600
You need to stop this.
We're not a couple.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.400
We've never been a couple,
and never will.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.600
This week
I'd like you to think about

08:00.800 --> 08:03.500
Plato's Dialogues
of the middle years.

08:03.700 --> 08:08.200
"The Republic", "Phaedo",
"Symposium".

08:08.500 --> 08:12.900
Now, this will all be
on next week's mid-term,

08:13.200 --> 08:15.200
so I suggest you read up on it.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.900
Ah, Jacob,
do you have anything to add?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.600
Just a reminder.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.300
The mid-term will cover
all of the in-class lectures

08:26.600 --> 08:29.800
as well as
all of the assigned readings.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.700
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.400
I prefer yellow.
It's easier on the eyes.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.100
OK. OK? Yeah. Thank you, Jacob.

08:41.400 --> 08:46.100
And... see you all next week
for the mid-term.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.800
- Josh.
- Yes?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.700
I saw you hitting on Beth.
NOT a good idea.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.600
- She's spoken for.
- What?

09:00.700 --> 09:04.000
She'll come back to me.
They always do.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.100
So... Mr Parker.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.900
Do you intend
to be ready for this exam?

09:10.200 --> 09:13.400
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.700
Because I was
looking over the books last night

09:16.900 --> 09:20.400
and you need a B on this test
just to pass this class.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.700
Actually,
I double-checked that, Professor.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.400
He needs a B+.
We can't bend on this.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.700
I got it.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.200
- Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.100
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.800
I might lose my financial aid
or not be allowed back.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.700
Well, you're fucked, then.

09:40.900 --> 09:45.000
So come to my party, hook up
with Beth, and enjoy your last week.

09:45.300 --> 09:50.100
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I'm invested in this relationship.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.400
Invested? Who are you, Charles
Schwab? Listen to yourself!

09:54.700 --> 09:56.600
I would give my life...

09:56.800 --> 10:00.100
for one evening
of consensual sex with that girl.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.800
I've gone this long without cheating.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.700
You're already cheating!

10:04.900 --> 10:07.900
Any time you pass up sex
you cheat yourself.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.100
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs

10:11.400 --> 10:14.900
and take advantage
of young girls is shrinking daily.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.700
I gotta make a call.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.500
I'm telling you, you pass this up,
it'll haunt you forever.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.700
Your dick will never forgive you.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.400
What do you think, man? Don't you
want to experience something new?

10:30.700 --> 10:34.100
It ain't easy being Josh's penis.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.900
We've been here two months,
and I feel like I'm in a coma.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.600
- Stop it.
- I wish I was your dick, EL.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.200
If something doesn't happen soon,
I'm gonna leave.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.500
- Enough.
- 'Hello? '

10:46.700 --> 10:50.400
Carla, it's Josh. Sorry to bother
you, is Tiffany around?

10:50.700 --> 10:52.600
Tiffany is not here.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.700
She didn't sleep here
last night... again.

10:55.900 --> 10:59.300
And it would be great
if for one hour you didn't call.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.100
- Right.
- If she wanted to talk to you

11:02.400 --> 11:04.200
she'd call you.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.200
Deal with it.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.000
- You bitch!
- Does she sound hot?

11:14.100 --> 11:18.400
We've never gone this long
without talking. Something's wrong.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.500
She found someone else,
like you should.

11:21.800 --> 11:26.700
The clock is ticking. Before you know
it you'll be 40 and paying for girls.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.100
# She good-looking
got a mojo cooking

11:30.300 --> 11:33.300
# Yeah, wouldn't give me
the time of day

11:33.500 --> 11:36.600
# But if my occupation
was stars and constellations

11:36.900 --> 11:40.400
# We could get together
in the Milky Way

11:40.600 --> 11:43.600
# And everybody wanna know somebody

11:43.900 --> 11:46.700
# Everyone wants to drop your name

11:46.900 --> 11:49.700
# You need no reservation
no special invitation

11:49.900 --> 11:54.600
# No college education
if you've got fortune and fame... #

12:01.100 --> 12:03.600
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

12:04.700 --> 12:06.700
I should really warn you,

12:06.900 --> 12:11.000
it's been known to affect
your decision-making abilities

12:11.300 --> 12:13.300
and lower your inhibitions.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
Good. That's the plan.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.300
No, that-that's...
Yes, that is the plan.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.200
- You bring cash?
- Why?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.700
- We've got chicks for sale.
- What?

12:24.900 --> 12:28.100
# Hey, now I'm snappy
got my mojo... #

12:28.400 --> 12:32.100
Trust me. I've been goin'
to this school seven years

12:32.300 --> 12:36.000
and I know the key
to a well-rounded college education

12:36.300 --> 12:38.400
is experimentation.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.900
Let me show you.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.900
This is an auction. Remember...

12:45.100 --> 12:47.500
you are not buying the girl,

12:47.700 --> 12:51.800
only her company, and sale does not
constitute sexual relations.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.700
I know. Believe me, I've tried.

12:55.900 --> 13:00.000
Without further ado,
let's introduce our first... person.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.100
Laura!

13:03.300 --> 13:05.200
Laura's from Long Island.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.300
She likes the outdoors
and loves seafood.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.300
- OK, let's start the bidding at $5!
- $3.50!

13:12.600 --> 13:15.700
Good God, moneybags,
she's not a Happy Meal.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.100
- $5.
- OK, we've got five. Do I hear 10?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.500
10 bucks.

13:23.700 --> 13:27.500
Who's got 15 bucks
for a lovely evening with Laura?!

13:27.800 --> 13:31.600
OK, we got 15. Who can beat 15?
Going once, going twice...

13:31.900 --> 13:34.500
Sold... to the captain.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.900
There you are.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.400
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not much.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
- You look great.
- Thank you.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.400
You're welcome.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.900
Listen, Jacob's here,
and he's a total psycho...

13:51.200 --> 13:53.600
Can you go outbid him?

13:53.800 --> 13:56.800
You know what,
I didn't bring that much money.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.400
You don't understand. He's obsessed.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.700
See? That's fun, right?

14:04.900 --> 14:10.200
OK, PK. Now, I want you two
to kiss each other.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.700
All right, has anyone seen Beth?
There she is!

14:13.900 --> 14:17.400
Say hi to the crowd, Beth.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.200
Hi.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.300
Can I hear a $5 opening bid?

14:23.500 --> 14:26.400
- $5 right here!
- Who can beat five?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.200
- Seven.
- $10.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.900
- $10! Going once. Going twice.
- $15!

14:33.200 --> 14:35.600
- 20.
- 25!

14:35.800 --> 14:39.100
25. Who can beat 25? Going once.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.800
- Going twice.
- 26.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.000
- 26, going once.
- 30!

14:45.200 --> 14:49.300
- OK, can anyone beat $26?
- I just said 30!

14:49.600 --> 14:52.200
There must be someone
who can beat $26?

14:52.300 --> 14:56.400
- Me, right here! 30!
- Sold! To my man Josh for $26.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.500
You heard me.
I bid $30 loud and clear.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.200
Your bid didn't count.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
- Why?
- Because you're a TA.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.000
- So?
- This auction is for students.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.800
Goodbye.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.900
# On and on until the early morning

15:17.100 --> 15:22.000
# They're rockin' on and on
until the early morning... #

15:25.100 --> 15:27.900
Thanks for doing that. I owe you one.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.200
- You owe me more than one.
- Do I?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.900
Technically.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.900
Well...

15:36.100 --> 15:38.400
are you ready to collect?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.200
I think so. Yeah.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.600
We're touching.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.700
It's a lot of fun.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.700
We're having a good time.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Who's Tiffany Henderson?

16:23.200 --> 16:26.600
Just some girl I used to date
since I was, like, five.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.100
But that's over now. She blew me off.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
Oh, poor baby.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You must be very hurt.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.200
Do you need some special attention?

16:41.600 --> 16:44.100
Well, I am pretty upset.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.100
Did that help?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.300
That helped a lot.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.400
I have an idea.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.599
What do you say?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.900
Uh, I don't think so.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.099
Come on! It'll be fun.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.700
- I've always wanted to try this.
- No...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.500
Yes.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.000
I'm gonna interview you.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.900
Fine.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.900
OK.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.300
- OK, Josh.
- Yes.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.300
What do you look for in a girl?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.200
Um, well, let's see.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.300
She should be smart and funny and...

17:56.300 --> 17:58.400
That's good, too.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.200
Do you feel better yet?

18:02.400 --> 18:07.100
I feel a little bit better.
Yeah. A little...

18:07.400 --> 18:09.700
What else do you look for?

18:09.900 --> 18:13.600
She should be attractive and...

18:13.800 --> 18:17.200
nice and...

18:20.600 --> 18:24.500
Topless. And topless.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.200
And she should kiss me.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.000
What else?

18:40.200 --> 18:42.500
She shouldn't stop kissing me.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.000
Why don't you keep doing that?

18:57.300 --> 19:01.100
# Tiny salmon swimming in a stream

19:04.000 --> 19:08.100
# Tiny salmon
chasing that impossible dream

19:10.700 --> 19:13.100
# The mynah bird says

19:17.500 --> 19:20.000
# The chimpanzee says

19:24.300 --> 19:26.700
# The friendly owl says

19:31.500 --> 19:34.600
# But the salmon can only say

19:44.300 --> 19:46.100
# And it's sad #

19:51.300 --> 19:53.900
# Good morning, everyone.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.400
# Good morning, everyone.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.000
# How are you and you and you #

20:00.300 --> 20:02.200
What are you so happy about?

20:02.400 --> 20:05.500
I don't know.
Do I seem happy this morning?

20:05.700 --> 20:08.800
Well, you're bouncing around here.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.700
You do seem
unusually light-hearted.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.700
Maybe it's because I had
the best time of my life last night.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.800
Twice! And once this morning.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.000
You and Beth?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Shut up. What happened?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.700
No way! You're lying.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.100
I'm not lying.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.800
You can't make out with someone
then pretend you had sex.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.500
- That's really uncool.
- I'm not pretending.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.900
Forget it. I know you're lying.
I guarantee it.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.400
You wanna bet?

20:41.600 --> 20:45.100
Great. I'm gonna bet
on something you can't prove.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.800
You videotaped it!

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
No, no, no, I didn't!
Gimme that! Gimme that!

20:58.300 --> 21:01.900
- No way! This is amazing!
- I was kidding, I was kidding!

21:03.100 --> 21:05.200
- Gimme the tape.
- Huh? Come on.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.300
- We're gonna see it sooner or later.
- He's got a point.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.900
Oh-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no!

21:13.100 --> 21:15.700
Give it to me. No, give it to me.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.700
- EL, no.
- Josh, please? We need this.

21:23.300 --> 21:27.600
OK, listen, seriously.
You can't tell anyone you saw this.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.300
Oh, yeah.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.900
OK. PK!

21:34.100 --> 21:37.000
Barry, hit the lights.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.100
It's boner time!

21:50.500 --> 21:53.700
'Hey, Tif. It's me
coming to you live from Ithaca. '

21:53.900 --> 21:57.200
I thought I asked you
to mail this yesterday?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.800
Yeah, you did. I mailed it today.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.400
Fast-forward to the horny stuff.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.300
Is this the shit
you've been sending Tiffany?

22:11.200 --> 22:12.800
Oh, my God.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.000
# It's you... #

22:15.200 --> 22:17.300
Oh, fuck!

22:17.500 --> 22:20.000
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
Oh, God!

22:24.600 --> 22:26.700
W- wait a second.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.800
Tell me you mailed
the Beth tape to Tiffany.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.900
Yes!

22:35.000 --> 22:38.100
Shit! Oh, no! Oh, no!

22:38.400 --> 22:39.800
Hey, hey.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.800
Did you make a copy?

22:43.400 --> 22:45.700
If you made a copy,
we could watch the copy.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.200
Don't answer it!

22:50.600 --> 22:54.400
'Hey, it's
Josh and Rubin. Leave a message. '

22:54.600 --> 22:56.700
'Hi, Josh. It's Tiffany.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.900
'Sorry we haven't spoken.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.700
'Listen, my grandfather passed away.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.600
'I've tried calling you
a few times, but no one picked up.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.400
'I didn't want to leave
this message on your machine

23:09.600 --> 23:12.900
'but by now you're probably
a little worried so...

23:13.200 --> 23:16.500
'Anyway, I'm at my parents'
house helping my mom.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.300
'She's really a wreck.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.400
'If I don't speak with you,
I'll call Monday.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.300
'I'll be OK. I just need some time.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.300
'Bye. I love you. '

23:29.900 --> 23:32.200
That's not fair.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.700
How come she gets to see the tape
and we don't?

23:35.900 --> 23:40.300
She gets back there Monday.
That leaves three days to get there.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.800
Get where? Austin?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.300
- That's like 10,000 miles from here.
- 1,800.

23:46.600 --> 23:51.000
You wanna drive 1,800 miles
in three days? Just fly.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.900
Do you have money for a ticket?
I don't.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.300
- All right, so we're driving.
- You're coming?

23:57.500 --> 24:00.700
What else am I gonna do,
stay here and learn?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.500
Road trip.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.700
Just a minute. Hold on.

24:07.900 --> 24:10.600
He's probably jackin' off.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.600
What do you guys want?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.500
Kyle, this is an emergency.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.800
Wait. Let me at least
go back and call my dad.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.400
Call your dad?
Would you listen to yourself?

24:34.600 --> 24:37.800
You're 19 years old,
and you're a fucking sissy.

24:38.100 --> 24:41.300
All you ever do is sit
in a library and play Myst.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.400
It's pathetic.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.600
He's trying to say that
this is your chance to do something.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.800
Be a risk-taker. Come with us.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.600
You're just saying that
because you want my car.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.100
No! No, we've always liked you.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.700
Or just give us the car.
That would make him a risk-taker.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.000
Shut up, all right?
He's coming with us.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.900
Come on, Kyle. It'll be fun!

25:12.100 --> 25:15.000
Aren't you even curious
where we're going?

25:16.300 --> 25:18.000
No.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.500
OK, we're going to the University
of Austin. Sure you won't come?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.200
I don't like Massachusetts.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.900
Austin's in Texas.
You're thinking of Boston.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.900
You've never left this town,
have you?

25:32.100 --> 25:34.000
No, not really.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.100
That could turn
into a debilitating phobia.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.800
OK.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.900
- Can I feed Mitch?
- Yes, actually you can.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.700
There's a brown box of mice
by his cage.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.200
Give him one tomorrow. Just one.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.100
- I'll feed him a mouse tomorrow.
- OK.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.900
You can count on me.
OK? I'm reliable. OK?

25:57.200 --> 26:00.500
You guys do good.
Have a good trip, safe trip.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.200
Buckle up your seat belt.
I'm gonna feed the snake!

26:04.400 --> 26:07.500
I'll feed the snake,
I'll watch the snake.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.500
'So off they went. '

26:09.700 --> 26:13.300
They had 1,800 miles to go,
and only three days to do it.

26:13.600 --> 26:17.900
It was a killer journey and one
that changed them all forever.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.100
The end.

26:24.200 --> 26:29.000
- So we're gonna go look over here.
- Whoa. That's it? This story sucks.

26:29.300 --> 26:33.300
- What happened with the tape?
- Right. The tape.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.300
Well, um...

26:35.500 --> 26:39.600
Well... Like I said,
they were on a race against time.

26:47.900 --> 26:52.500
# The smoke stack spitting black soot
into the sooty sky

26:56.300 --> 27:01.000
# The load on the road brings a tear
to the Indian's eye... #

27:01.300 --> 27:03.600
Since we didn't get to see the tape,

27:03.800 --> 27:06.300
- can you at least describe it?
- No.

27:06.600 --> 27:12.200
# The elephant won't forget
what it's like inside his cage

27:14.900 --> 27:19.000
# The ringmaster's Telecaster
sings on an empty stage... #

27:20.200 --> 27:21.500
Admit that Beth is amazing.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.500
I admit it, she's amazing.
She's perfect.

27:25.700 --> 27:30.300
I don't know why you feel so guilty.
Technically you haven't cheated.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.500
What are you talking about?

27:32.700 --> 27:35.400
There are these rules that guys have,

27:35.600 --> 27:39.000
an understanding
as to what constitutes cheating.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.000
Take your situation, for example.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.100
It's not cheating.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.700
Not when you're in a different
area code - not to mention state!

27:49.000 --> 27:50.800
That makes no sense.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Don't look at me, Kyle.
I don't make the rules.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.600
This is legit. I've read an article.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.000
There's a whole bunch of them,
like loopholes.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.800
Say you were sleeping with
two girls at the same time,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.500
it's not cheating
because they cancel each other out.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.400
- Ahh.
- Exactly!

28:09.500 --> 28:12.200
Or if you're too wasted
to remember...

28:12.500 --> 28:14.300
It is not cheating.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.100
Because if you
can't really remember it,

28:17.400 --> 28:19.200
it never really took place.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.600
# Uh-huh

28:21.600 --> 28:23.100
# Whoo-oo... #

28:23.300 --> 28:25.600
OK, I've got one. Ready?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.500
It's OK if you spread peanut butter
on your testicles

28:28.700 --> 28:31.100
and let your dog lick it off.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.500
- Because it's your dog!
- Jesus Christ!

28:35.700 --> 28:38.800
- You know, because it's your dog!
- We got it.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.900
# Whoo-oo, uh-huh

28:41.100 --> 28:44.400
# Goddam right, it's a beautiful day

28:44.700 --> 28:46.800
# Uh-huh, goddam right #

28:51.700 --> 28:53.800
Somebody's gonna die tomorrow.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.700
That's right.
One of you is marked for death.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.600
And first thing tomorrow morning,

29:08.900 --> 29:12.200
a chosen one
will experience nature's wrath

29:12.400 --> 29:14.300
in all its fury.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.600
Who are you?

29:30.800 --> 29:32.400
I'm Beth.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.400
Are you here for the feeding?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.400
Excuse me?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.500
You're early. It's not till tomorrow.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.500
You should come back.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.000
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.000
I think I'll pass.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.100
Have you seen Josh?

29:51.100 --> 29:53.200
He went to visit his girlfriend.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.300
Tiffany?

29:55.900 --> 29:57.800
I thought they broke up.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.500
I mean this girl who's a friend
of his. You know what I mean.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.500
Where did he go?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.900
Austin?

30:12.400 --> 30:14.100
Austin, Massachusetts?

30:15.500 --> 30:18.500
You mean Boston, Massachusetts?

30:18.700 --> 30:21.600
Yeah, that's what I said. Boston.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.800
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.700
He is such an asshole.

30:28.900 --> 30:32.100
I can't believe
he just lied to my face like that.

30:32.400 --> 30:37.200
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that?

30:37.500 --> 30:41.200
- She was topless?
- Girls don't stand around naked.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.700
Yeah, they do. OK? This is my story.
You wanna hear it or not?

30:45.900 --> 30:50.400
- It just doesn't make any...
- Shh. Please, no interruptions, OK?

30:52.700 --> 30:57.100
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked! Really naked!

30:59.800 --> 31:02.200
I know guys can be jerks.

31:02.400 --> 31:07.100
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.000
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.000
All men are perverted pigs.

31:12.300 --> 31:17.000
All they care about...
really, all they THINK about is sex.

31:17.300 --> 31:22.100
- You're so right. I feel so used.
- Face it, we're all used.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.700
In most men's eyes, we're just flesh.

31:24.900 --> 31:28.600
- It's so sick!
- It IS sick. Think about it.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.900
If they had it their way...

31:31.100 --> 31:34.100
God, I don't even want to know
what would happen

31:34.300 --> 31:36.600
if they had it their way!

31:36.800 --> 31:39.800
What am I supposed to do
now that he's gone?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.900
- Go to Boston and bust his ass.
- Right.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.800
Confront him
and his little girlfriend.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.900
Face to face. You totally should!

31:46.100 --> 31:50.100
Show her what an asshole Josh is,
right?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.900
Hmm...

31:55.500 --> 31:57.300
# I'm freakin' you, baby

31:57.500 --> 31:59.300
# Drivin' you crazy

31:59.500 --> 32:01.300
# I'm freakin' you, baby

32:01.400 --> 32:03.300
# Drivin' you crazy

32:03.500 --> 32:05.600
# I'm freakin' you, baby... #

32:05.800 --> 32:07.300
Ooh! These, too.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.000
# I'm freakin' you, baby

32:09.100 --> 32:10.700
# Drivin' you crazy... #

32:10.900 --> 32:13.000
Kyle, come here for a second.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.900
We're a little
short on cash right now,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.900
so we need to put this
on your credit card.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.900
We'll give you the cash
when we get back, I promise.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.700
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

32:29.900 --> 32:32.500
Hello! This IS an emergency.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.800
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.400
# I'm freakin' you, baby
drivin' you crazy

32:39.600 --> 32:43.200
# When I get to your place

32:43.500 --> 32:47.300
# I wanna turn up the highs
and turn up the bass... #

32:49.600 --> 32:51.800
We're in no-man's-land.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.600
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.600
This is gonna save us five hours,
minimum. Thank me later.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.300
We should go back to the interstate.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.600
- We're not goin' back.
- Yeah, have some faith.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.900
It's a challenge.
That's why it's a short cut.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.700
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.800
Damn it! Fuck!

33:16.000 --> 33:19.200
I give us 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.100
If we turn around we'll lose
five hours backtracking.

33:23.400 --> 33:28.500
Turn around? Why? Because of this?
We could make it.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.400
Make it? You mean jump it?

33:32.700 --> 33:36.000
No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.

33:36.200 --> 33:41.300
It can be done. This incline
is 30 degrees roughly, right?

33:41.600 --> 33:44.400
The factory weight
of the car is 1,600lbs.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.300
Add us, plus cargo...

33:46.400 --> 33:49.600
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50mph,

33:49.900 --> 33:53.000
our trajectory
will clear 10 feet, easy.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.900
No way. Absolutely not.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.300
We'll go 60 just to be certain.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.200
We're goin' back.
It's impossible.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.100
You sure?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.800
With physics I'm always sure.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.700
I'm driving.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.900
I don't think you guys heard me.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.400
This is my car
and we're not gonna jump any rivers.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.699
Kyle, it's 10 feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.300
Look, I can spit across this gap.

34:32.199 --> 34:33.900
Yeah.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.600
Well...

34:35.800 --> 34:37.699
better make it 75.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.900
- OK. Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

34:41.199 --> 34:44.800
No, you guys. No.
EL, get out of my car.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.900
Kyle, in the car. Come on.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.200
We're PK.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.200
You know we need to hit 60?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.900
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop!

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
Thank you! Yes!

35:30.700 --> 35:32.900
What did I tell you?

35:49.300 --> 35:51.300
Oh, my God.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.400
Oh, my God!

35:57.400 --> 36:01.400
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.900
I only said we'd make it across.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.900
I never said
the wheels would stay on.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.300
What the hell are we gonna do now?!

36:09.500 --> 36:11.600
I'm totally screwed!

36:11.800 --> 36:15.800
I don't have time...
to be walking... through the woods!

36:16.100 --> 36:19.800
Josh, we'll call a tow truck,
have the axles fixed.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.400
We'll lose half a day at most.
It's just the wheels.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.900
The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

36:46.200 --> 36:48.900
they just turn around
and screw me over.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.800
Just something about Josh,
he's just different.

36:54.100 --> 36:56.100
I feel like we had a connection.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.300
I don't think
I'll ever be able to trust a guy.

36:59.600 --> 37:04.200
You shouldn't! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was back in 1985

37:04.500 --> 37:07.100
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

37:07.400 --> 37:11.500
It was a regular-size van.
Before that mini-van crap.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.100
So there's no hope, huh?

37:16.300 --> 37:19.600
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.900
You can keep that.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.600
God. Crap.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.900
Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.900
We almost died in that explosion.

37:40.100 --> 37:44.700
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.800
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.100
I must live.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.100
Yeah, right. We all must live.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.500
Before we do that,
we must get back on the road.

37:59.700 --> 38:03.900
We shouldn't be going
to sleep right now!

38:08.100 --> 38:12.400
'Let's just lay
an indication here and there. '

38:15.300 --> 38:17.800
'And a whole bunch of colour... '

38:28.200 --> 38:30.100
Excuse me.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.700
I'm sorry, do you need to get that?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.100
Do you need something?

38:38.300 --> 38:41.600
Yeah.
This is sort of an unusual question.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.900
But do you have any marijuana
I might buy?

38:45.200 --> 38:49.100
Our car exploded last night
and I'm practically all out.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.300
Am I a drug dealer?

38:51.500 --> 38:55.100
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking, though.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.100
No? OK, that's OK. Thanks.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.000
Is there anything else
I can help with?

39:02.200 --> 39:06.500
Perhaps you'd like an 11-year-old
prostitute. We can do that.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.400
Or maybe we can off someone
for you. Huh?

39:09.600 --> 39:13.200
I've got it.
Why don't we start small?

39:13.400 --> 39:15.800
Would you like a fresh towel?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.300
You could roll that up and smoke it.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.600
Dick.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.800
By the way, Cheech,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.100
that credit card
you guys gave me was maxed out,

39:27.300 --> 39:32.300
so don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.900
Um, Mr Earl Edwards?

39:42.100 --> 39:45.100
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.400
That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

39:49.700 --> 39:54.300
I tried three times, sir. If you
have another card, I'd be happy to...

39:54.600 --> 39:56.500
Don't give me any attitude.

39:56.700 --> 39:59.500
You go fix
that little toy back there,

39:59.700 --> 40:01.700
and charge this friggin' card.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.200
We've been coming here for 20 years.

40:04.400 --> 40:08.700
- We've only been open eight years.
- Do it now.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.000
Relax, it's not a big deal.

40:13.200 --> 40:17.500
You don't understand,
when Josh finds out he'll freak.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.600
You can't rent a car without
a credit card. You just can't.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.000
So, what are we gonna do?

40:26.100 --> 40:28.200
Tell you what. Stay here.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.200
Take him out
for breakfast or something.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.400
I'll go take care of this.

40:35.100 --> 40:40.100
Earl, Cookie, we have a situation.
Now, brace yourselves.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.600
The police have found Kyle's car
abandoned in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.200
It's been blown to bits.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.100
We checked with the university -
he's missing.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.700
Mother of God.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.800
- Good morning.
- Hello.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.200
Hi. How can I help you?

41:15.900 --> 41:20.100
Yeah, hi. I was sent over here
to check out bus 111,

41:20.400 --> 41:24.100
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.300
You seem to be having problems
with the... rotator splint.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
Engines have rotator splints?

41:30.800 --> 41:32.400
Yeah.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.300
She runs good now, but not for long.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.700
I can have it back to you
as good as new in a week.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.700
Let's see.
Well, Jared's still in Aliquippa,

41:44.900 --> 41:47.800
- I take it he called you from there?
- Yeah.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.600
Five days.
Well, I think we can work that out.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.300
Would you please not feed my dog?

41:58.300 --> 41:59.900
I didn't.

42:00.100 --> 42:03.000
You can't feed
Seeing Eye dogs treats.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.800
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.400
Don't roll your eyes at me.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.500
French toast.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.900
Bacon. Good for you.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.200
- And scrambled eggs.
- Thank you.

42:31.400 --> 42:35.700
Excuse me, but this has powdered
sugar on it, and I ordered no sugar.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.900
I can't have
too much sugar in the morning.

42:39.200 --> 42:42.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're absolutely right.

42:42.500 --> 42:47.100
Tell you what, let me take this back
and bring you out a new piece.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.700
Is everybody good? OK, great.

42:50.900 --> 42:54.500
Do you know where my possessions are,
because I can't...

42:54.800 --> 42:59.000
- Wait, no. They were in the car.
- That's... that's hilarious.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.200
All right,
let me warm that up for you.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.400
- There you go.
- Thanks.

43:28.400 --> 43:32.500
Excuse me. And the French toast
will be out in just a minute.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.400
- OK, thank you.
- OK, great.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.700
French toast, no sugar.

43:55.900 --> 43:59.100
- All right? Sorry about that.
- No problem.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.000
That's a nice guy.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.900
It's good.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.600
OK!

44:29.400 --> 44:31.600
I don't wanna know
how you got this.

44:31.800 --> 44:35.400
- I stole it from a blind chick.
- I don't wanna know.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.300
What? I'm gonna give it back.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.300
Probably.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.000
# Going to work, I hate it

44:42.200 --> 44:44.500
# Shakin' that stick
that drives people crazy

44:45.800 --> 44:47.900
# Doin' that stuff that you do

44:49.600 --> 44:52.400
# Quit messin' me up with your voodoo

44:52.600 --> 44:55.500
# You drive me crazy with that

44:55.800 --> 44:58.100
# Boogie-oogie-oogie-oogie-oogie

44:58.300 --> 45:00.800
# You drive me crazy with that boogie

45:01.000 --> 45:02.500
# Boogie, boogie

45:02.600 --> 45:05.300
# Your lips are hot and spicy

45:06.700 --> 45:09.100
# Servin' up cooked beans and rice

45:11.400 --> 45:14.100
# I feel like
she's a hoppin' and stompin'

45:16.100 --> 45:18.300
# Makin' love to the gators
in the swamp... #

45:24.700 --> 45:28.400
Can we please stop soon?
I need to use the bathroom.

45:28.700 --> 45:33.400
Actually, I don't have to go yet,
so we'll stop in a couple of hours.

45:33.700 --> 45:35.500
OK.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.200
I'm kidding, Kyle. We'll stop.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.200
Jeez, you have to stand up
for yourself. Be more assertive.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
OK.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.300
What's your deal?
Why are you so worried?

45:48.500 --> 45:52.200
I don't know. I guess it's my dad.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.500
He's, like... strict.

45:55.700 --> 46:00.200
He really is gonna kill me
when he finds out about that car.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.700
So you screwed up. Big deal.
People make mistakes.

46:03.900 --> 46:08.400
He'll get over it.
Besides, that car sucked anyways.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.600
I really do need
to go to the bathroom.

46:13.900 --> 46:17.100
- We're makin' a pit stop.
- Again?!

46:19.200 --> 46:22.100
You're about to experience
first-hand...

46:22.300 --> 46:26.800
exactly what it means to be in
the lower region of the food chain.

46:27.100 --> 46:30.900
Mitch is going to bite into you.

46:31.200 --> 46:33.600
He's going to squeeze.

46:33.800 --> 46:38.400
He'll actually start digesting you
while you're still alive.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.800
But don't be scared.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.000
No. No, no.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.100
It'll be a quick death.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.600
Be brave.

46:51.800 --> 46:54.400
You'll barely feel it.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.400
Come on.

46:59.300 --> 47:01.700
Come on. You gonna fuckin' eat him?

47:13.800 --> 47:16.100
Josh, wait up a second.

47:16.300 --> 47:19.400
This is supposed to be a road trip.

47:20.500 --> 47:24.600
All we do is drive the whole time.
It's ridiculous.

47:24.900 --> 47:28.300
- No one forced you to come.
- We're making great time.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.800
And if Tiffany saw that tape,
it'd be a good thing.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.100
What is that supposed to mean?

47:34.200 --> 47:38.400
Beth is an angel. She's here
to help you change your life.

47:38.700 --> 47:42.300
Besides, did Tiffany
ever let you videotape her?

47:42.600 --> 47:44.600
I think not.

47:44.800 --> 47:46.700
It's a sign, Josh.

47:47.900 --> 47:50.500
Hello?

47:50.700 --> 47:53.500
- 'Professor Anderson? '
- Who's calling?

47:53.700 --> 47:56.600
Hi, Professor, it's Josh Parker.

47:56.900 --> 47:58.800
Oh, uh...

47:59.000 --> 48:02.600
Hello, Josh.
What can I do for you?

48:02.800 --> 48:06.600
- Well, I was in a car accident.
- 'Oh. Oh, my God. '

48:06.900 --> 48:09.800
I'm PK.
It's just I'm in kind of a bind.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.600
All my notes and books
were destroyed.

48:12.800 --> 48:15.400
Is it possible to get an extension?

48:15.600 --> 48:18.600
'Maybe take the mid-term
a couple days later? '

48:18.900 --> 48:21.800
Oh, sure.
Yes, it sounds like an emergency.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.900
How about an extra three days?

48:25.100 --> 48:28.900
- 'Would that work? '
- Yeah, that would be fantastic!

48:29.200 --> 48:32.200
- Are you sure?
- 'Just glad you're not hurt. '

48:32.400 --> 48:34.500
I'm marking it down right now.

48:34.700 --> 48:37.400
'That's great, Professor. Thank you. '

48:37.600 --> 48:39.500
OK, goodbye.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.800
Who was that?

48:42.000 --> 48:45.900
Oh, that... that was Josh Parker.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.500
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

48:48.700 --> 48:53.200
He was just confirming
the date of the exam. Such a worrier.

49:08.300 --> 49:11.100
It's gonna be OK. I'll find him.

49:11.300 --> 49:15.300
And we'll find whoever did this,
I promise. It's gonna be OK.

49:15.600 --> 49:20.600
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody
was raped and murdered here.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.100
What the hell gives you that idea?

49:23.300 --> 49:25.800
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.200
- Well?
- Nothing yet.

49:32.400 --> 49:36.200
Good thing is,
there's no evidence of a struggle.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.600
No blood or clothing or anything.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.400
And we haven't found
a single drop of semen yet.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.600
Hi. I'm visiting my friend from home.

50:04.800 --> 50:08.100
But she doesn't know I'm coming.
It's a surprise.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.400
How nice. How can I help you?

50:10.500 --> 50:14.000
I've never been here before.
I don't know where she lives.

50:14.300 --> 50:16.700
What's her name? I can look it up.

50:16.900 --> 50:19.000
Oh, OK. Tiffany Henderson.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.100
Do I know you?

50:29.400 --> 50:32.700
No, you don't.
Actually, I know your boyfriend.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.300
OK. Who are you?

50:35.500 --> 50:39.700
I'm Beth.
Could we just sit down for a minute?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
OK.

50:51.100 --> 50:53.600
Um, this is really hard for me,

50:53.800 --> 50:57.100
but it's definitely
something you should hear.

51:00.500 --> 51:04.000
Your boyfriend is cheating on you...
with me.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.700
We were together Thursday night.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.900
Twice.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.600
And once again Friday morning.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.600
I thought you should know.

51:24.100 --> 51:25.900
Sorry.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.500
Tiffany! What the hell are you doing?

51:35.500 --> 51:38.800
- Who's that guy?
- That's her boyfriend.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.000
THAT's her boyfriend?

51:42.200 --> 51:44.700
Yeah. He's been cheating on her.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Baby, I love you!

52:21.000 --> 52:22.900
I- I'm sorry,

52:23.100 --> 52:27.900
but you have the most beautiful feet.

52:28.200 --> 52:32.300
Ohh... Would you like
a foot massage?

52:32.600 --> 52:35.500
No, I would not like a foot massage.

52:35.700 --> 52:39.000
I would hate
a foot massage!

52:39.200 --> 52:41.400
OK. I'm sorry. Relax.

52:41.600 --> 52:46.300
Are there any guys out there
who are just normal?! Huh?!

52:46.600 --> 52:50.000
Unleash the fury, Mitch.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.300
Unleash the fury.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.500
Come on, Mitch.

53:00.700 --> 53:02.100
Eat him.

53:03.100 --> 53:06.200
Please, Mitch. Go get him, boy.

53:06.500 --> 53:09.200
He's right there. Kill him.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.500
Maim him. Bite him.

53:15.700 --> 53:17.400
UNLEASH THE FURY!

53:27.200 --> 53:29.000
Wow, this is cool.

53:29.200 --> 53:32.300
I've never been in
a fraternity house before.

53:33.300 --> 53:35.100
Is this gonna work?

53:35.200 --> 53:38.500
Of course it's gonna work.
I know the handshake.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.000
Hi.

53:43.200 --> 53:46.000
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

53:46.200 --> 53:49.500
I'm Rubin Carver,
a Xi Chi brother from Ithaca.

53:49.700 --> 53:53.300
We're just passing through
and looking for a place to party,

53:53.600 --> 53:55.800
maybe even a place to crash.

54:06.300 --> 54:08.600
Xi. Chi. Xi, Chi.
Xi, Xi, Xi.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.300
Chi.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.100
Hmph.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.600
Wow!

54:34.500 --> 54:38.400
Ahem. Uh, everyone, this is Rubin.

54:38.600 --> 54:43.500
Apparently, Rubin is our fraternity
brother from our Ithaca chapter.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.700
These are his friends.

54:48.100 --> 54:52.000
Listen, uh, we've interrupted
your dinner so we'll just...

54:52.300 --> 54:54.500
Hey, don't be crazy.

54:54.700 --> 54:57.500
There's plenty of food to go around.

54:57.700 --> 54:59.600
You guys are welcome to stay.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.900
You know, this food's pretty good.

55:22.300 --> 55:26.400
Hey, you do realise
this is a national black fraternity?

55:26.700 --> 55:28.700
They know you're not a member.

55:30.800 --> 55:34.100
I'm sorry. I don't think
about that kind of stuff.

55:34.300 --> 55:37.600
OK, relax. OK?
They're just messing with us.

55:37.900 --> 55:39.900
They're pissed because he lied.

55:40.100 --> 55:42.700
- I say we get out of here.
- Shh, relax.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.200
Someone's got some explaining to do.

55:45.400 --> 55:48.800
- Look what we found in his bag.
- What?! What is that?!

55:49.000 --> 55:51.600
No, I've never seen that before!

55:51.800 --> 55:54.900
What are you doin'?
Are you in the Ku Klux Klan?

55:55.200 --> 55:58.300
- Whoa, whoa. That is not ours.
- That's not mine!

55:58.500 --> 56:02.100
OK, hold on, th-there's
obviously some explanation.

56:02.400 --> 56:07.100
Yeah, there is. See, your boy's
an evil bigot and now he's gonna die.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.200
Justice!

56:13.300 --> 56:17.600
Kyle. Kyle.

56:17.900 --> 56:19.900
Kyle!

56:22.400 --> 56:25.000
There you are. I thought we lost you.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.700
- Am I in the hospital?
- You passed out.

56:29.900 --> 56:32.900
They were messin' with us, Kyle.
It was a joke.

56:35.300 --> 56:39.300
Racist?
But I watch Oprah Winfrey every day.

56:39.600 --> 56:42.400
It was a joke, outtie. A joke!

56:42.600 --> 56:45.000
I get it.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.500
Sure, put a Klan hood in my bag.

56:47.700 --> 56:50.400
Yeah. Oh, that's funny.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.300
Whoa.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.200
I need a wine cooler.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.700
- Hey, have mine.
- Thanks.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.700
# It's tricky to rock around

57:00.900 --> 57:03.200
# To rock around,
that's right on time

57:03.400 --> 57:06.900
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky

57:07.100 --> 57:10.100
# It's tricky to rock around
to rock around that's right on time

57:10.300 --> 57:13.300
# It's tricky
trick-trick-trick-tricky

57:13.600 --> 57:17.400
# I met this good girlie
her hair was kinda curly

57:17.600 --> 57:21.100
# Went to her house and busted out
I had to leave her early

57:21.400 --> 57:24.500
# These girls are really sleazy,
all they just say is "Please me"

57:24.700 --> 57:26.500
# Spend some time and rock around

57:26.700 --> 57:28.600
# I said it's not that easy

57:28.800 --> 57:30.300
# It's tricky to rock around

57:30.500 --> 57:32.600
# To rock around
that's right on time

57:32.800 --> 57:36.500
# It's tricky, it's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky

57:36.700 --> 57:38.600
# It's tricky to rock around... #

57:44.600 --> 57:47.000
# In New York the people talk
and try to make us cry

57:47.300 --> 57:51.000
# They really hawk but we just walk
because we have no time

57:51.200 --> 57:53.100
# And in the city it's a pity

57:53.300 --> 57:54.900
# Cos we just can't hide

57:55.100 --> 57:59.000
# Tinted windows don't mean nothing,
we know who's inside

57:59.200 --> 58:00.600
# It's tricky to rock around

58:00.800 --> 58:02.800
# To rock around
that's right on time

58:03.000 --> 58:06.200
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky... #

58:06.400 --> 58:09.400
Isn't he just
the cutest little thing?

58:09.700 --> 58:12.300
Oh, yeah, Kyle's the man!

58:12.500 --> 58:15.000
# Tricky, tricky,
tricky, tricky, huh! #

58:22.400 --> 58:24.700
You mean never? Not even once?

58:26.500 --> 58:30.200
Well... I mean, I've had sex before.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.800
Just, um,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.300
never with a person.

58:35.500 --> 58:37.200
Right.

58:39.400 --> 58:42.000
Well, I think that's kinda cool.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.800
- You do?
- Yeah.

58:46.100 --> 58:50.100
I mean, you should hold out.
It should be special.

58:53.100 --> 58:55.500
Wait till you're in love.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.500
I think I love you.

59:02.600 --> 59:04.500
You are so cute.

59:07.200 --> 59:10.500
# Inside each other

59:11.800 --> 59:13.900
# You can see inside me

59:14.100 --> 59:16.300
# Will you come inside me?

59:16.500 --> 59:21.500
# Do you want to ride further up?

59:21.800 --> 59:24.200
# If you can see inside me

59:24.400 --> 59:26.700
# Will you come inside me?

59:26.900 --> 59:29.800
# Do you want to ride... #

59:30.900 --> 59:33.900
I take it you don't have a condom?

59:34.100 --> 59:36.800
Uh... no.

59:37.100 --> 59:39.600
Um, I guess I'm all out.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.700
Well, Lawrence probably has some.

59:43.900 --> 59:46.000
Why don't you try that drawer?

59:50.500 --> 59:53.300
Next to the Old Spice,
behind the belts.

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.100
Good guess.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.500
You know what?

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.700
Um, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing and, um...

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.200
I'm... Oof.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.700
Shhh. Relax, baby.
Let Rhonda handle this.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.400
# Time's a-changing

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.700
# More so each year

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.200
# But the early mornin'

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.300
# Snow the pimp is here

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.700
# So let it rain

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.500
# And let the guitar rock... #

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.300
- Thanks for a great time.
- Take care.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.300
Stay cool.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.200
Hey, Devon.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.300
What's up?

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.700
# Well, well, well, well, well

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.800
# And I'll be catching them pike

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.400
# Like on the 10 pound test, success

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.100
# Never 'fess, take a guess

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.900
# I'll be the early morning
snow pimp... #

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.100
Let's go, Kyle.
We want details. What happened?

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.000
Well, we had a few drinks,

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.500
danced a little, and, you know...

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.600
No, we don't know.
Why don't you tell us?

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.300
What the hell is that?

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.600
Did you kill a cheetah?

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.600
What? No. These are her underwear.
She gave 'em to me.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.000
I boinked her!

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.900
Boinked?

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.100
Yeah, did you just say
the word "boinked? "

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.700
Well, Kyle,

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.900
I hope you got the boinking
out of your system,

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.800
cos we got a lot of driving
to do today.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.900
Do not get your hopes up
about visiting Graceland,

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.100
cos we're about the mission at hand.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.300
- Josh.
- What?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.900
That sounds like a good plan,
except for one little thing.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.300
- What little thing?
- We're out of money.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.900
OK, before you fill out these,
I have to ask some questions.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.900
If you qualify, you can
make a sperm deposit. Understood?

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.300
Mm-hmm. Fire away.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:32.400
Tell the truth, because if you don't
the test will and you won't get paid.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.100
So, first off, have any of you
done any drugs in the past 36 hours?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.500
And that includes marijuana.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.800
PK, next.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:50.100
Have any of you had sex
or masturbated in the past 24 hours?

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.900
Well, I guess I'm out.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.900
Because I had sex last night...

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.900
with a girl!

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.100
That's nice.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.700
You'll find everything you need
in these binders.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.600
Would you each take a cup.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.100
- PK.
- And yours.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.500
I'd appreciate it if you'd
return those after you're finished.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.600
OK. Uh, thanks.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.400
Cheers.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.300
Excuse me. Do you have anything
with Asian women?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.500
I have this thing for Asian chicks,
and there's none here.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.300
This isn't Peep World.
Our selection is limited.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.000
- You're gonna have to make do.
- OK.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.700
You've been more than helpful.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.900
Is something wrong?

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.000
Well, no.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.300
But... I just couldn't help
but notice that...

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.900
Is there something between us?

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.200
I mean, I was thinking
that maybe you might want to...

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.600
I don't know...
help me out with a little...

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.500
professional assistance?

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.600
Do you need some help?

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.600
Yes, I do.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.700
'Dr Morris, dial 1-1-8, please.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.100
'Dr Morris, please dial 1-1-8.'

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.200
The moment I saw you out there,
I thought you were incredible.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.400
You're not like most of the girls
I know. You're a woman.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:33.200
That's fine. Turn around, drop your
pants, hands flat on the table.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.100
Oh, my God.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.400
- This is great. Wow. Like this?
- Exactly.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:45.900
I have to admit,
I love you in that uniform.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.200
Do those nylons go all the way up,
or are they, like thigh high?

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm gonna perform a procedure
called milking the prostate.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.300
It's an anally-induced ejaculation.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.600
Anal?

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.200
You're gonna feel strong pressure
from inside your rectum.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.800
Come on, you don't have
to get all scientific, baby.

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.800
I mean, we can just talk...

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.900
Stop! OK, keep doin' it. Yaaah!

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.600
Right there! Ahhh!

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.800
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.100
OK. All done.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.800
That was awesome!

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.700
Wait. Wait. Does that work?

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.600
I mean,
is it even medically possible?

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.300
Oh, yeah, it works.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.400
It works like a charm.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.900
But back to our story.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.600
'It was Sunday morning
back in Ithaca,

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.100
'when things suddenly took
an unexpected turn. '

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.600
I'm a mouse.
I'm a mouse. Eat me. Eat me.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.300
Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.
Eat me. Eat me.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.900
Come on.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.400
You better eat him, Mitch,
before I do.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.200
He's tasty.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.500
He's tasty, Mitch. Oh! Oh!

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.200
Mmm! Mmm!

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.000
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Why'd you lie to me?

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:01.300
I didn't lie.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.500
You-you told me
that Josh went to Boston.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.700
- I didn't. I said Austin.
- You said Boston.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.200
Because of you,
some guy's life is ruined.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.800
So what? Besides, wherever he went,
he went because of you.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.400
- What do you mean, because of me?
- Look, it's obvious.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.900
Josh likes you. It's disgusting.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.400
I knew you'd come back.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.400
- What do you want?
- So, how was your getaway with Josh?

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.200
- I wasn't with Josh.
- Sure. Doesn't matter, though.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.900
Cos Josh won't be back next semester.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.500
He's about to flunk philosophy.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:45.200
- What are you talking about?
- He thinks that he has an extension,

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.500
but thanks to
a... certain someone - me -

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.400
he doesn't.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.600
He's an idiot.
You psycho.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.500
Oh, my God!

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.700
# I wanna rock

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.700
# Turn it down, you say

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.600
# All I gotta say to you
time and time again I say no!

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.200
# No, no, no!

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.600
# Tell me not to play

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.000
# All I gotta say to you
when you tell me not to play

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.000
# I say no, no, no, no

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.399
# So if you ask me why
I like the way I play

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.899
# There's only one thing
I can say to you

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.100
# I wanna rock! Rock!

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:54.100
# I wanna rock! Rock!

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.100
# I want to rock! Rock... #

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.000
'That night I set the guys up
at my grandparents' house.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.600
'I haven't been there in a long time.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.000
'When I was seven years old
I set their dog on fire

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.899
'and wasn't invited back.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.300
'But I hear it's still real nice. '

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.399
I'm serious. "Please",
"Thank you", "This is delicious"

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.500
are the only words
you're allowed to say.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.200
What? I'm great with old people.
Grandmas love me.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.899
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. "Manilow"?

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.500
- Barry's last name is Manilow?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.100
- His name is Barry Manilow?
- Yeah.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.500
- Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.899
Oh, look at you boys.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.300
Jack, they're here!

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.700
# I see you, baby, shakin' that ass

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.500
# Shakin' that ass,
shakin' that ass... #

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.300
Jack, Barry's friends are here.
Come and say hi.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.900
The boys are here.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.700
- Oh, hey, fellas.
- Hi.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.900
- Hey, how's it going?
- Wait. Let me get up.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.700
- I'll give you guys the full tour.
- Oh, honey!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.900
Careful. Your boner!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.200
Well, what do you want me to do,
cut it off?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.000
I'll tell you what, fellas,

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.900
we'll start by showin'
you where you're gonna sleep.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.400
I'll show you
what we call the guest room.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.400
Follow me, boys. The guest room...

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.500
Ohhh.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.800
# Y'all know
what I'm talkin' about

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.400
# Don't be lookin' at me
like that now

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
# Come on... #

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.600
Excuse me.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.000
You remember this kid?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.000
No, sure don't.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.600
Fuckin' airhead.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.700
Let me ask you once more.
Have you seen my son?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Ow. Now that you mention it,
there were a few guys in.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.000
If you loosen my arm,
I could get their bill.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.400
Use your other arm.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.900
- How many were there?
- A few.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.800
Aaah! Four!

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.500
One of 'em was trying to score drugs.

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.700
Honey, look. They made two calls to
Austin, Texas. Maybe they went there.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.600
Havin' a smoke?

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.700
Uh... yeah, yeah.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.100
I can't sleep, either.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.000
Goddam Viagra
gets my heart racing like a lab rat.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.200
Are you OK?

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.500
- You look kinda goofy.
- No. No, it's nothing.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.300
- Come on, out with it.
- OK.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.000
Well... I almost died two days ago.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.400
- What?
- Our car exploded.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.700
I could be dead right now.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.400
And since that happened,
I find myself asking why.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.800
You know? Like...

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.100
What is my reason for living?

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.000
Are you gonna
pass that doobie, or what?

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.100
Doobie? Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.200
Uh, thanks.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.800
You know what your problem is?

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:05.400
You're all brains.
Not enough cock and balls.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.600
Actually, uh, people have been
telling me that my whole life.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.900
In the sixth grade I got so worried
about the situation in Iraq,

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.800
that I was on
an adult dosage of Xanax.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.300
And by eighth grade,
I was in therapy three times a week.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:26.900
And the truth is, weed is the
only thing that could balance me out.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.900
You know what I mean? Like...

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.400
You PK?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.500
Hey, old man.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:41.000
I got the fuckin' munchies real bad.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.200
How 'bout you?

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:51.100
OK, Tiffany,
it's time to stop being so sad.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.200
Look at all this mail you got!

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.300
Look how many nice people
care about you.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.800
You even got a package from Josh.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.500
Really?

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.100
Shall we open it
and see what he says?

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.000
Yeah, come on, Tif. Let's open it.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.500
- It's a tape.
- Oh.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.800
Well, pop it in.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.500
Maybe I should watch this on my own.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.600
Oh, come on.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:25.000
This'll definitely cheer you up.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.700
'What do you look for
in a girl? '

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:38.900
'Well, let's see.
She should be smart... '

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.200
'and, um, funny.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.700
'And, uh...

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.000
'That's good... that's good, too. '

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.100
'What else do you look for? '

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.200
'Um... She should be, uh, attractive.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.300
'And, um, topless.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.300
- 'Uh-huh. '
- 'And she should kiss me. '

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.100
Bye-bye.
You boys be good now.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.100
- Bye-bye.
- I'll tell Barry you said hello.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.700
Hey, Jack, have that bitch make me
some blueberry pancakes. Now.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.500
# Amour, amour

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.400
# I built a lovin' machine

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.400
# I bow all night long

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.500
# I built a lovin' machine

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.000
# I bow all night long

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.600
# I put the two dollar in

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.400
# Three on fought frowned

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.300
# Grab a hold of my drummer, baby

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.000
# Everybody watch out

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.800
# Yeah... #

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.000
Excuse me. Ahem.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.300
www. episodetwo/spoilers...

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.300
back slash...

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.600
OK, look.
Some people are here

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.900
and they are being very rude.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.000
OK. Call you back.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.300
I'm sorry, but we need your help.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.700
- Do you know Tiffany Henderson?
- Room 109.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Well, her grandfather died,

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.500
and she asked me
to pick up her mail.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.600
Oh, how sad. Do you have the key?

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Well, she didn't bring it to the
funeral so I was hoping you could...

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.400
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you need the key.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.900
Don't worry. Her mail will be here,
safe and sound.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.800
It's not like that, you see?
She needs something.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.700
- This is an emergency.
- Don't make a big deal out of it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.700
Well, it's not a big deal, but
you need the key. Rules are rules.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.100
No one's asking you to do anything
wrong. Just, you know, look away.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.200
Go have an Eskimo pie.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.700
You guys are gonna have to leave.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.500
We're not leaving without that mail.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.900
Listen to the man before you get
some Jackie Chan on your face.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.400
- Come on, let's go.
- That means now, asshole.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.500
Jesus!

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.500
I think he broke my nose. Oh, God!

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.300
Come on, Susie.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:00.100
- You're a wrestler?
- You bet, Mary. You wanna go?

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300
- Let me see it.
- Oh, God!

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.400
All right.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.200
- Who's my bitch?
- What?!

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.500
That's it. No, no, no!

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.700
OK, everyone, freeze!

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.200
This here is pepper spray,
and we will use it.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.200
These guys jumped me.
I was just sitting behind my desk!

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.400
Kyle?

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.900
- Dad?
- That's your dad?

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.200
Freeze now! Everybody freeze!

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.600
Put your weapon down now!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.600
My son was kidnapped!

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.600
Whoa, whoa... Who was kidnapped?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.100
I wasn't kidnapped.
These are my friends from school.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.000
What are you talkin' about?

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.500
We all drove down here together.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.500
What?

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.900
Then explain to me how
the frigging car got blown to hell!

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.400
- Well, see...
- It was stolen.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.000
That's right. Tell him, Kyle.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.000
Uh-huh. Exactly.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.000
Stolen?

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.900
What about the damned credit card?

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.400
It was inside,
and that was stolen, too.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.100
Bullcrap! This is ridiculous! Why
didn't you tell us where you were?

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.000
Because I knew you'd get mad! See?

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.800
- I'm not mad! You're going with me.
- Josh?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.100
- Tiffany!
- What the... What's going on?

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.200
- Nothing.
- Damn, dude, she is hot!

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.300
My girlfriend's pagin' me.
Can we let them go?

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.200
- Good idea.
- No one is going anywhere!

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.900
- He's comin' with me.
- Get off of me!

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.400
I'm going back with these guys.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.000
Shut your mouth and don't talk back.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.600
Why don't YOU shut up?

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.400
What the hell did you just say to me?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.500
I said, you shut up.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.800
You've always told me
to stand up for myself.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.700
Well, now I am.
Leave me alone, you jerk!

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.200
You ungrateful...

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
- What...
- Go this way.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.700
Go away! Go away!

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.100
What was that all about? I mean,
Josh, what are you doing here?

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.600
I just missed you. That's all.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:46.600
I missed you, too, but it's crazy
for you to drive all the way here.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:49.600
What?
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.300
I am. But Josh, you have your
entire life to live up at school.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.200
This isn't healthy. Besides...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.800
I realised a few things
this past week.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.400
You did? Like what?

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.800
Like, we're in college.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.400
The window of opportunity to go out
and have fun and meet new people

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.300
is getting smaller by the day.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.600
- It is?
- Come on, Josh.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800
We've been together forever.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:26.800
I mean... you're pretty much
the only guy I've ever been with.

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.000
What do you mean,
"pretty much the only guy"?

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.300
Well, I was 14, and you were away
at camp, but that was years ago.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.400
Besides,
we're in different area codes.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.000
I've been thinking a lot
about us, too.

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.400
The real reason I drove down...

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.500
Hold that thought.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.700
Hello?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, he's right here.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.000
Who is this?

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.500
Hold on.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.100
It's for you. It's Beth.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.300
Who's Beth?

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.400
Uh...

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.900
Beth? What are you doing?

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:23.100
I'm not sure what's going on between
us but I need to tell you something.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.900
I'm actually glad you called,
cos I wanted to tell you something.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.600
OK, you first.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.800
I can't really talk right now,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.100
but I'll explain everything
when I get back.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.700
'OK? Really. I promise. '

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.600
Uh, I- I gotta get going, OK?

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.100
- Wait! Do you want to hear mine?
- Right. Sorry.

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.000
Is it good?

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.800
Not really. Jacob lied to you.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.500
There's no extension
on your mid-term.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.100
What?

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.000
'He tried to trick you. If you
don't get back you're gonna fail. '

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:00.000
Shit!

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.700
'She should be smart and funny. '

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
- 'Aren't you glad I called? '
- Yes. Thank you.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.900
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, OK? Bye.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.000
- Is this for me?
- Hmm?

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.600
Oh, God, no, no, no! You don't...

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.000
What the hell is this?

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.500
'I can see myself on TV,
I think it must be rewound. '

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.300
It's Barry.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.400
'Hey, look...

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.900
'Look at that. I can see my bum.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.300
Why would you send this to me?

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.900
So wait - you guys broke up,
then you hugged and then you left?

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.600
Yeah, pretty much.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.400
Loser! Always have sex with the girl
one last time before you break up.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.400
Everyone knows that!

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.100
It's not like that. I've known her
my whole life. She's my best friend.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.900
So, what do we do now?

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.000
- Wanna smoke some drugs?
- I don't think so.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.500
My mid-term starts in exactly
46 hours so I got to get back.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.300
Although I'm gonna fail anyway,
so it doesn't matter but...

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.000
- Which class was it?
- Ancient Philosophy.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.600
I can teach you ancient philosophy
in 46 hours.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.300
You can?

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.400
I can teach a monkey in 46 hours.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.000
You just got to find a way
to relate to the material.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:32.700
Like, OK...
You like pro wrestling, don't you?

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.600
- Who doesn't?
- OK.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.000
Socrates was like
the Vince McMahon of philosophy.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.000
He started it all.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.500
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.100
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.900
# Life is a cigarette

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.300
# You smoke to the end

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.200
# But if you rocket the middle bit

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.300
# Then you burn all your friends

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.200
# The wider your eyes,
the bigger the lies

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.600
# Yes, it's true... #

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.700
Oh, what was the 20-Man Battle Royal?

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.600
Participation explains predication.
Aristotle.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.200
Right.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.900
You know this! You'll be fine.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.700
Freeze, right there! Don't move!

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.800
Is this philosophy?

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:38.200
If you hear anything, give me a call.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.200
A bomb threat is serious.
Take my card.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.200
PK.

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.700
OK, let's move it.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.900
What's goin' on
with this bomb threat?

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.300
False alarm, people.
Everyone back inside.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.800
We're gonna do this thing.
That's right.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.700
- Josh.
- Beth!

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.800
Hey, um... thanks for calling.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:27.800
Uh, it's been a really weird week.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.000
So, how'd you do?

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.100
On the exam? Pretty good, actually.

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.200
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.900
Were you surprised?

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.700
You weren't back
in time for the exam,

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.700
so I, uh, called in a bomb threat.

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.200
You did that?

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700
That's insane.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.900
I wasn't gonna let Jacob
get you kicked out.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.500
Besides, I might need you
around next semester.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.500
So I did good, right?

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.200
Good?

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.300
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.600
Mom?

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm so sorry.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:33.600
Mom?

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:36.500
I got carried away
with the story there.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.700
So, anyway,
Josh got a B+ on his mid-term.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.900
He got to stay in college.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.300
'And he and Beth are still together.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.300
'They're still really into
making their... home movies.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.600
'In fact, they have about 70 hours
of unedited amateur video. '

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.700
It's pretty wild.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:01.700
I know, because I bought some of it.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.600
That guy Jacob?

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.000
'He left school. He went on to become
the leader of some cult in Iowa.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.200
'He tried organising a mass suicide.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.400
'Only problem is,
he drank the Kool-Aid first

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.600
'and, well, everyone else
just kind of changed their minds. '

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.900
Too bad.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:24.400
As for Rubin... Remember Rubin?

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.700
Remember how he claimed that
he was destined for great things?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.300
The people of Earth need me.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.100
Well, he was right.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:38.000
Rubin used cross-pollination
to develop a strain of marijuana

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.800
that is not only remarkably potent...

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.200
but completely undetectable
by any drug tests.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400
Oh, my God.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.200
'He was named
High Times' man of the year. '

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.200
As for EL, despite his
swinging philosophy on sexuality,

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.900
he got serious with some girl he met.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.100
And you want me to use two fingers?

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.200
'I believe she was pre-med. '

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.200
Did I say two? Better make it three.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.400
Then there's Kyle.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.800
'Kyle and his father
reconciled their differences. '

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.600
Hi, Dad. Merry Christmas.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.800
'He brought his girlfriend home. '

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.600
Rhonda, this is my father, Earl.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.800
Dad, this is Rhonda.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.900
Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.400
Come here.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.100
That's the end of the tour.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:39.100
I hope you strongly consider becoming
part of the Ithaca tradition,

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.500
as we lead future generations
of young people

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.600
forward into the new century.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.200
Thanks a lot. You were great. Thanks.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.600
- Thank you so much.
- No, it was fun.

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.300
I'll see you in the fall.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.300
- OK. Thank you.
- I'd like to say thank you.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.700
I mean, uh, that was...

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.200
really great.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.100
Thank you.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.200
Thank you.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.900
Thank you.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.300
Thank you.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.400
Mom?

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.600
Thank you.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.900
Thank you, Mommy.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.100
I'm pumping your mommy.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.500
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.300
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh #

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.100
# OK, what is it tonight?

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.100
# Please, please tell me
what the hell is wrong

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.900
# Do you wanna eat, do you
wanna sleep, do you wanna drown?

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:17.100
# Just settle down
settle down, settle down

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.100
# I'll give you candy,
give you diamonds, give you pills

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.200
# Give you anything you want,
hundred-dollar bills

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:29.100
# I'll even let you watch
the shows you wanna see

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.900
# Just marry me,
marry me, marry me now

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.900
# Oh, hey

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.000
# I'm so sick of you tonight

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:50.200
# You never stay awake
when I get home

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.600
# Is something wrong with me,
something wrong with you?

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.500
# I really wish I knew,
wish I knew, wish I knew

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.800
# I'll give you candy,
give you diamonds, give you pills

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.100
# Give you anything you want,
hundred-dollar bills

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.000
# I'll even let you watch
the shows you wanna see

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.900
# Just marry me,
marry me, marry me now

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.900
# Oh, hey

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.500
# You've become so distant

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.200
# Stop touching me!

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.100
# Are you in love with this guy?

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.300
# When I was young I learned her game

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.600
# When love and happiness
were the same

01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:00.000
# Now I'm older and I don't play

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.800
# I found out the hardest way

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:07.800
# I got wasted, she got mad

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.900
# She called me names
and she called her dad

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.900
# He got crazy and violent, too

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.500
# One by one I'll torture you

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.100
# I'll give you candy,
give you diamonds, give you pills

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:28.500
# Give you anything you want,
hundred-dollar bills

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.400
# I'll even let you hear
the songs you wanna sing

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.000
# I'll give you anything,
anything, anything

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.600
# I'll give you anything,
anything, anything

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:44.400
# I'll give you anything,
anything, anything

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.600
# Anything

# Anything
