WEBVTT

00:02.790 --> 00:04.250
Tom is our insect wrangler,

00:04.250 --> 00:06.170
who's gonna help us set up
a demonstration

00:06.170 --> 00:09.210
on one of the coolest animals
on Earth, the bombardier beetle.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.630
This animal is
a chemical warrior.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.970
This guy has a couple of
chemicals in his abdomen,

00:14.970 --> 00:17.550
and it's able to shoot out
boiling hot streams

00:17.550 --> 00:19.970
of a really toxic liquid

00:19.970 --> 00:22.230
that have the same sort of mix
as rocket fuel.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.270
‐GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Oh, wow.
‐PETER WARD: There it goes.

00:24.270 --> 00:26.310
TSOUKALOS:
How cool.

00:26.310 --> 00:31.900
You can actually see the
squirts, the mist, the vapor.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.900
What was the evolutionary
process of this beetle

00:33.900 --> 00:38.620
for that defense mechanism
to even exist?

00:38.620 --> 00:40.490
It defies evolution.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.370
♪ ♪

01:08.650 --> 01:11.360
NARRATOR:
Houston, Texas.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.780
December 11, 1992.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.320
In one of the strangest alien
abduction cases on record,

01:19.320 --> 01:22.200
eight different people report
being taken

01:22.200 --> 01:25.000
onto an extraterrestrial
spacecraft.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.330
Even stranger is the fact
that the same eight people

01:29.330 --> 01:33.380
were allegedly abducted again
three days later.

01:33.380 --> 01:38.010
Derrel Sims, a former U. S.
intelligence operative,

01:38.010 --> 01:41.050
is the first to investigate
these separate cases

01:41.050 --> 01:43.350
as a single event.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.020
DERREL SIMS:
All these people came back

01:45.020 --> 01:47.060
with the same
identical information.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.440
Exact same story, same location,
same entity, same everything.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.270
I was just absolutely amazed

01:52.270 --> 01:55.360
at the clarity
of their information.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.780
These people were kept separate
and apart from each other.

01:58.780 --> 02:02.030
No one had any knowledge
of any mass abduction.

02:02.030 --> 02:05.500
NARRATOR: Each of the
self‐described abductees

02:05.500 --> 02:08.710
reported being taken aboard
a small craft

02:08.710 --> 02:12.380
that transported them
to a much larger spaceship.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.630
And once inside,

02:14.630 --> 02:18.840
they encountered other abductees
that were not human.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.140
They were all led out through
this massive hallway.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.430
It looked like a museum.

02:24.430 --> 02:26.850
They seem to have collected
species, animals, people,

02:26.850 --> 02:29.440
all kinds of things.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.150
This room that they found
themselves in

02:32.150 --> 02:35.280
that was straight out of
a science fiction movie

02:35.280 --> 02:39.320
with these glass tubes
and glass cases.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.570
And according to their
eyewitness reports,

02:42.570 --> 02:45.080
in these glass cases,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.910
they saw creatures that they
had never seen before,

02:48.910 --> 02:52.960
but also creatures
from planet Earth.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.420
When we look out into the cosmos
we have to ask,

02:56.420 --> 02:59.220
is it filled with beings
of different kinds

02:59.220 --> 03:02.470
of‐of types of
animalistic characteristics?

03:02.470 --> 03:05.890
Bird‐headed beings,
other animal‐headed beings

03:05.890 --> 03:07.890
that exist within the cosmos.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.020
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Thousands of abductees

03:13.020 --> 03:15.190
have given us information

03:15.190 --> 03:19.400
on a wide variety of
extraterrestrial beings

03:19.400 --> 03:22.660
in all kinds of shapes
and forms.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.950
And so we would think, really,

03:24.950 --> 03:28.950
that in this universe there are
extraterrestrial entities

03:28.950 --> 03:33.920
of every form, size and shape
that we can possibly imagine.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.960
Insectoid, octopoid,

03:37.960 --> 03:42.510
looking like giant cats
or birds.

03:42.510 --> 03:45.100
Is there some actual
genetic connection

03:45.100 --> 03:47.260
with some of these
extraterrestrials

03:47.260 --> 03:50.890
being of a lineage from animals
that we have here on Earth?

03:52.980 --> 03:55.810
NARRATOR: Could the accounts
given by the eight people

03:55.810 --> 03:58.530
who were abducted in Houston,

03:58.530 --> 04:00.780
and numerous other reports
of encounters

04:00.780 --> 04:02.860
with animal‐like aliens,

04:02.860 --> 04:05.820
point to the possibility
that humans

04:05.820 --> 04:07.450
are not the only life‐form
on Earth

04:07.450 --> 04:09.490
to have been
captured and examined

04:09.490 --> 04:12.410
by extraterrestrial visitors?

04:15.630 --> 04:19.500
In 1859,
biologist Charles Darwin

04:19.500 --> 04:22.420
introduced the world
to the theory of evolution,

04:22.420 --> 04:25.760
with his book,
<i>On the Origin of Species.</i>

04:25.760 --> 04:29.680
In it, he proposed that gradual
multi‐generational changes,

04:29.680 --> 04:32.810
occurring due to
natural selection,

04:32.810 --> 04:36.860
had resulted in the modification
of all existing species.

04:36.860 --> 04:41.900
While scientists agree that this
process does, in fact,

04:41.900 --> 04:45.530
take place to some extent,
in recent years,

04:45.530 --> 04:49.120
evidence has been presented
that suggests evolution alone

04:49.120 --> 04:51.830
cannot account for all
of the species present

04:51.830 --> 04:54.040
in the animal kingdom.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.710
WARD:
There's one species of dog,

04:55.710 --> 04:58.920
but look at it‐‐ from
Chihuahuas to St. Bernards,

04:58.920 --> 05:01.420
to bulldogs,
everything in between.

05:01.420 --> 05:05.630
And all that has happened in
less than a few thousand years.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.970
This is crazy.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.510
This is like going from this
generalized wolf‐like creature

05:10.510 --> 05:13.430
into this huge variety of dogs.

05:13.430 --> 05:16.190
JOHN BRANDENBURG:
There are fossils of giraffes

05:16.190 --> 05:18.400
with short necks,

05:18.400 --> 05:22.230
and then we have the present.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.900
And there's no
intermediate form.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.490
If you suddenly give a giraffe

05:26.490 --> 05:29.280
a much longer neck
than it had before,

05:29.280 --> 05:32.660
a lot of things have to change.

05:32.660 --> 05:35.580
Its blood pressure regulation
has to change.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.790
It's got to have
a different heart.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.460
It's going to be eating
different things

05:39.460 --> 05:41.670
with a long neck.

05:41.670 --> 05:45.130
All of that software for the
animal has to be rewritten.

05:45.130 --> 05:48.390
And you're telling me
this all happens overnight.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.010
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists propose

05:53.010 --> 05:55.180
that if some,

05:55.180 --> 05:57.390
or possibly all of
the life‐forms on Earth

05:57.390 --> 05:59.190
cannot be explained

05:59.190 --> 06:02.480
as the product of natural
selection, or evolution,

06:02.480 --> 06:06.030
it may, in fact, offer proof,

06:06.030 --> 06:08.860
of not only intelligent design,

06:08.860 --> 06:13.200
but also what they believe to be
extraterrestrial intervention.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.870
And they say the overwhelming
evidence can be found

06:16.870 --> 06:19.750
by examining the practices
of ancient cultures

06:19.750 --> 06:22.000
all over the world.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.680
Manchester, England.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.800
September 2015.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.180
Researchers from the
University of Manchester

06:35.180 --> 06:38.350
use the latest medical
imaging technology

06:38.350 --> 06:40.940
to reveal the first look inside

06:40.940 --> 06:45.480
more than 800 mummies
from ancient Egypt.

06:45.480 --> 06:49.320
The deceased are not humans,

06:49.320 --> 06:51.530
but crocodiles,

06:51.530 --> 06:57.000
cats, baboons, birds,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.080
and numerous other species
painstakingly preserved

07:01.080 --> 07:04.090
for thousands of years.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.670
When we think of mummies,

07:05.670 --> 07:07.510
we tend to think of people
being mummified.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.800
But what we actually find out
is that Egyptians

07:09.800 --> 07:11.930
also mummified
a tremendous amount

07:11.930 --> 07:15.220
of cats, dogs, alligators‐‐

07:15.220 --> 07:18.350
all sorts of things were being
mummified in ancient Egypt.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.900
NARRATOR: The mummification
of animals was so pervasive

07:24.900 --> 07:29.650
that in 2015,
archaeologists discovered

07:29.650 --> 07:33.280
that a catacomb underneath
a temple dedicated to Anubis,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.780
the canine god of the dead,

07:35.780 --> 07:39.830
held a staggering eight million
dog mummies.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.170
The dogs were thought to have

07:42.170 --> 07:45.670
a direct connection with Anubis,
the lord of the underworld.

07:45.670 --> 07:49.050
That was the jackal‐headed god,

07:49.050 --> 07:51.930
so when a dog died,
it could carry a message.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.970
NARRATOR: It is believed that as
many as 70 million animals

07:55.970 --> 07:59.770
were mummified at sites like
this throughout Egypt,

07:59.770 --> 08:03.190
which is roughly the same as
the number of human mummies

08:03.190 --> 08:06.860
that have been found.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.980
70 million is just the ones
that have been found, right?

08:09.980 --> 08:13.110
Some presumably have
gotten lost, have decomposed.

08:13.110 --> 08:16.320
So the fact that there's
that many

08:16.320 --> 08:19.200
means that this practice
was widespread,

08:19.200 --> 08:23.120
and also that it continued
over a long period of time.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.580
This went on for the whole
2,000 to 3,000 years

08:25.580 --> 08:28.250
of ancient
Egyptian civilization.

08:28.250 --> 08:32.170
NARRATOR: But why did
the ancient Egyptians

08:32.170 --> 08:34.680
mummify their animals?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.970
RAMY ROMANY:
In Saqqara,

08:36.970 --> 08:40.310
you see thousands
of birds mummified

08:40.310 --> 08:42.810
right next to each other,
thousands of them.

08:42.810 --> 08:48.310
The reason that huge amount of
animals were mummified in Egypt

08:48.310 --> 08:52.110
was because they believed
those animals were sacred.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.650
They are the equivalent

08:54.650 --> 08:58.070
to lighting a candle
when you go to a church.

08:58.070 --> 09:02.950
You bring a mummified animal
that the god would employ.

09:02.950 --> 09:05.540
Historians believe
that the reason for this

09:05.540 --> 09:08.500
is that Egyptian people
originally were animist.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.880
In other words,
they saw the entire universe

09:10.880 --> 09:13.090
around them as filled with life.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.880
And they attributed deity,
divinity,

09:15.880 --> 09:19.550
to the animals
in their universe.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.310
NARRATOR: But it wasn't just
in ancient Egypt

09:25.310 --> 09:28.310
where animals
were so highly revered.

09:28.310 --> 09:31.190
Similar practices
of animal worship

09:31.190 --> 09:34.030
can be found among
the ancient Sumerians,

09:34.030 --> 09:36.910
the Maya and Aztec of
Mesoamerica,

09:36.910 --> 09:42.620
and the Australian aborigines,
just to name a few.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.080
And in each of these separate
cultures can be found stories

09:46.080 --> 09:50.090
in which animals are involved in
encounters with alien visitors,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.800
otherwise known as gods.

09:54.130 --> 09:55.510
Animals have always played

09:55.510 --> 09:57.470
a very interesting role
in the Bible.

09:57.470 --> 10:01.890
One of the races
of angels themselves

10:01.890 --> 10:06.020
who was witnessed by Ezekiel in
his famous chariot vision

10:06.020 --> 10:08.810
are in Hebrew called <i>chayot,</i>

10:08.810 --> 10:11.940
which translates as "animals."

10:11.940 --> 10:16.360
And indeed,
they had the faces of animals.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.780
Lions, eagles and the like.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.950
So, in all these
parallel cultures,

10:23.950 --> 10:27.790
we have a crossover
of‐of spiritual beings,

10:27.790 --> 10:30.420
and extraterrestrial beings,
manifesting in these forms

10:30.420 --> 10:32.960
that's repeated
over and over again.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.130
Could it be that these were
the same extraterrestrial beings

10:37.130 --> 10:40.930
that were visiting each of these
cultures at different times?

10:46.350 --> 10:50.190
NARRATOR: If cultures all across
the world revered animals

10:50.190 --> 10:54.520
as having a connection with gods
that came down from the sky,

10:54.520 --> 10:57.990
could this be evidence
that certain Earthly creatures

10:57.990 --> 11:02.700
possess a link
to extraterrestrial entities?

11:02.700 --> 11:06.490
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and suggest

11:06.490 --> 11:09.540
that some of the planet's
non‐human life forms

11:09.540 --> 11:11.580
may even be directly related

11:11.580 --> 11:15.130
to mankind's
ancient alien ancestors.

11:23.010 --> 11:27.310
NARRATOR:
Luxor, Egypt.

11:27.310 --> 11:31.190
Within the Mortuary Temple
of Hatshepsut,

11:31.190 --> 11:34.900
one of the few female pharaohs
of ancient Egypt,

11:34.900 --> 11:37.190
is a carving
of the bull god Apis,

11:37.190 --> 11:41.030
depicted with a solar disk
above his head.

11:41.030 --> 11:43.410
Although
he is little known today

11:43.410 --> 11:46.240
among the pantheon
of Egyptian deities,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.750
historians suggest
Apis was the very first god

11:49.750 --> 11:55.080
to be worshipped in Egypt,
emerging around 3,000 B. C.

11:55.080 --> 12:00.760
He was considered
to be the creator of humanity.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.260
Animals were so important
in ancient Egypt

12:03.260 --> 12:09.390
that one of the creation myths
starts with a bull.

12:09.390 --> 12:12.600
The bull
that comes out of nowhere,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.520
the bull
that comes out of the sky,

12:14.520 --> 12:19.440
that appears in the middle
of the endless ocean,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.990
is the one
that creates humanity.

12:21.990 --> 12:27.240
That bull is the father
of all humanity.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.370
In many, many mythic traditions,
it is an animal

12:30.370 --> 12:33.210
or sometimes a council
of animal that creates people.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.330
And different cultures
have different animals

12:35.330 --> 12:38.040
that played very,
very formative roles.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.460
Sometimes this is a particular
ancestor to humankind.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.680
Sometimes it's an ancestor
to a particular tribe

12:44.680 --> 12:46.510
or a group of people.

12:46.510 --> 12:48.720
We find this very commonly

12:48.720 --> 12:50.470
in the Northwest coast
Native American groups,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.020
where you'd have different clans

12:52.020 --> 12:53.730
that would have
different lineages

12:53.730 --> 12:55.940
sacredly founded
by different animals.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.690
The Wolf Clan, the Bear Clan,
the Frog Clan.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.400
And you can even
see this reflected

13:00.400 --> 13:04.740
in their totem poles
of those groups.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.320
(woman speaking
in native language over P. A.)

13:07.320 --> 13:09.620
NARRATOR: Many ancient cultures
throughout the world

13:09.620 --> 13:13.540
not only had stories that humans
were created by animals,

13:13.540 --> 13:16.670
but also depicted their gods
with animal features.

13:18.420 --> 13:21.920
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Ganesh, the Indian Hindu god,

13:21.920 --> 13:24.590
the one with the head
of an elephant,

13:24.590 --> 13:28.430
could intervene and solve
problems for the faithful.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.970
The monkey god Hanuman
was a bit of a trickster,

13:30.970 --> 13:33.020
but he could be seen interacting

13:33.020 --> 13:36.310
with human beings,
walking among us.

13:36.310 --> 13:39.480
In Aboriginal stories
from Australia,

13:39.480 --> 13:44.490
the creator of the universe
was a rainbow serpent.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.410
Many of the animal gods
were described

13:47.410 --> 13:50.070
as descending from the sky.

13:50.070 --> 13:54.660
The Egyptians believed in Thoth,
a god with a head of an ibis

13:54.660 --> 13:58.420
who taught science,
philosophy and magic.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.790
Khepri had the head of a scarab

14:00.790 --> 14:03.710
and played a major role
in the creation of the world.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.760
ROMANY:
Most of the gods were depicted

14:07.760 --> 14:12.470
with the animal head
and a human body because

14:12.470 --> 14:15.140
ancient Egyptians knew
that the head had the wisdom.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.480
NARRATOR: If the ancient stories
of flying monkeys

14:20.480 --> 14:23.150
and animal‐headed gods
are literal accounts

14:23.150 --> 14:25.530
of what our ancestors witnessed,

14:25.530 --> 14:28.450
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest,

14:28.450 --> 14:32.410
is this evidence
that humankind was created

14:32.410 --> 14:36.080
by otherworldly beings
that are genetically connected

14:36.080 --> 14:39.120
to animals
that still roam the Earth today?

14:39.120 --> 14:43.960
Or did the extraterrestrials
disguise themselves as animals

14:43.960 --> 14:48.380
to appear more friendly
and acceptable to early humans?

14:50.380 --> 14:52.720
HENRY: We could be dealing
with extraterrestrials,

14:52.720 --> 14:55.220
extraterrestrials
who chose to incarnate

14:55.220 --> 14:57.730
as cats and dogs
and other animals,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.310
in order to guide humans,

14:59.310 --> 15:01.850
and also
to disguise their true form,

15:01.850 --> 15:04.020
to manifest on Earth in a form

15:04.020 --> 15:07.360
that would be perhaps
more palatable to humans.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.030
Zeus is one
of our most well‐known gods

15:10.030 --> 15:11.990
from the Greek Pantheon.

15:11.990 --> 15:15.240
And we have Zeus transforming
himself into a bull,

15:15.240 --> 15:17.080
which is part of the story

15:17.080 --> 15:19.750
of how the people
of Europe were formed or Europa.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.210
We have Zeus transforming
himself into a swan,

15:23.210 --> 15:24.840
Zeus and Leda.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.260
In the traditions
of West Africa,

15:27.260 --> 15:30.340
the voudon traditions, Papa
Legba as he's sometimes called,

15:30.340 --> 15:34.180
very often appears
as a variety of animals.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.220
In the Native American
Pawnee culture,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.980
the sky god, the creator god,
the Great Spirit,

15:39.980 --> 15:42.520
would never come in direct form,

15:42.520 --> 15:45.820
but use animal forms,
many different animals,

15:45.820 --> 15:48.320
as a way to communicate
with the humans.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.990
NARRATOR:
In the Pawnee tradition,

15:51.990 --> 15:57.160
young men entering adulthood
would go out on vision quests.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.960
They would isolate themselves
from the tribe,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.960
perform ritual prayers
and fast.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.920
Through this process, they would
enter a trancelike state

16:08.920 --> 16:14.180
in hopes of communicating
with these intelligent animals.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.760
TOK THOMPSON: A bear might
come up to you and say hi.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.140
It might be a caterpillar,
it might be a squirrel.

16:19.140 --> 16:22.060
But at some point,
something interacted with you.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.150
Some animal actually interacted
with you.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.270
And that was held
to be very, very profound

16:27.270 --> 16:29.780
in terms of your own identity,

16:29.780 --> 16:31.490
in terms
of your own spirituality.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.320
So the idea is
that each animal, therefore,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.870
is connected to their own
sort of animal spirit.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.660
So that a singular caribou
is in part in touch

16:40.660 --> 16:42.750
with this sort of
larger caribou spirit.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.370
So, in terms
of the vision quest,

16:45.370 --> 16:49.500
you might figure out
who your guardian spirit was.

16:52.090 --> 16:55.930
NARRATOR:
Similarly, in India,

16:55.930 --> 16:59.510
the prophets known as "rishis"
would describe animal encounters

16:59.510 --> 17:02.270
after extensive meditation.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.770
‐(singing in native language)
‐And in Mesoamerican

17:03.770 --> 17:05.650
and Pueblan cultures,

17:05.650 --> 17:09.360
shamans would use powerful
psychedelic plants

17:09.360 --> 17:13.110
to not only communicate
with otherworldly creatures,

17:13.110 --> 17:19.950
but in some cases, transform
into the animals themselves.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.870
In all these traditions,

17:21.870 --> 17:24.580
the encounters are taken
very seriously.

17:24.580 --> 17:28.670
These animal energies
are very real and tangible,

17:28.670 --> 17:31.590
and the wisdom
is extremely valuable.

17:33.550 --> 17:36.340
NARRATOR: Some ancient astronaut
theorists propose

17:36.340 --> 17:40.430
that while extraterrestrials may
disguise themselves as animals,

17:40.430 --> 17:44.180
they may also have
a real physiological relation

17:44.180 --> 17:47.270
to certain creatures on Earth.

17:47.270 --> 17:49.230
And they suggest

17:49.230 --> 17:51.690
that those creatures
were put on this planet

17:51.690 --> 17:53.990
‐with a very specific purpose...
‐(growling)

17:53.990 --> 17:55.740
‐(bird screeching)
‐...one that is vital

17:55.740 --> 17:58.240
to the advancement of humanity.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.250
NARRATOR:
Thousand Oaks, California.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.880
May 2017.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.590
Ancient Astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

18:14.590 --> 18:16.800
visits the Ventura BioCenter

18:16.800 --> 18:20.430
to examine one of Earth's
most curious creatures‐‐

18:20.430 --> 18:22.310
the bombardier beetle.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.810
This little bug is
a marvel of evolution,

18:25.810 --> 18:29.350
or, some say,
intelligent design.

18:29.350 --> 18:31.690
‐Peter, good to see you.
‐Giorgio, nice to see you.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.520
‐How are you? All right.
‐And this is Tom.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.900
‐Hi. Nice to meet you.
‐Hello, Tom.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.360
Pleasure. How's it going?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.110
Tom is our insect wrangler,

18:38.110 --> 18:40.110
who's going to help us
set up a demonstration

18:40.110 --> 18:43.410
on one of the coolest animals
on Earth, the bombardier beetle.

18:43.410 --> 18:45.830
TSOUKALOS: That's fantastic,
because about a year ago,

18:45.830 --> 18:48.660
Erich von Daniken gave me
his latest manuscript

18:48.660 --> 18:50.790
for his newest book.

18:50.790 --> 18:53.420
And we all know that there are
these multiple creatures

18:53.420 --> 18:56.550
that seem
to defy Darwinian evolution.

18:56.550 --> 18:59.630
And one creature
that jumped out at me

18:59.630 --> 19:02.970
that I hadn't heard before
was this beetle right here.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.850
This beetle is fascinating from
an evolutionary point of view.

19:05.850 --> 19:07.980
And in fact, it's been used
by many people

19:07.980 --> 19:11.020
to suggest that evolution
doesn't work at all, and

19:11.020 --> 19:13.770
the reason is the enormous
complexity of this thing.

19:13.770 --> 19:15.780
This animal is
a chemical warrior.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.400
It's able to shoot out
boiling hot streams

19:18.400 --> 19:20.820
of a really toxic liquid

19:20.820 --> 19:23.160
that had the same sort of mix
as rocket fuel.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.740
‐TSOUKALOS: That's amazing.
‐WARD: And it can shoot

19:24.740 --> 19:27.450
over 500 of these bursts
per second.

19:27.450 --> 19:29.120
‐Wow.
‐But the process happens

19:29.120 --> 19:31.330
so fast, it's almost
in the blink of an eye.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.670
So we have a high‐speed camera
over here

19:33.670 --> 19:35.960
that can shoot
about 2,500 frames per second,

19:35.960 --> 19:39.220
and with that camera,
we can slow down this process,

19:39.220 --> 19:40.970
and in seeing that process,

19:40.970 --> 19:43.680
we could work out
the exact sequence of events.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.640
So let's set this up with Tom
and watch this take place.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.770
Let's do it.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.480
Okay, guys, so what I've got is

19:49.480 --> 19:51.350
some non‐toxic,
very mild adhesive.

19:51.350 --> 19:53.190
And I'm just going to touch it
to the beetle's back,

19:53.190 --> 19:54.770
and that will suspend him
in the air.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.230
We're gonna give him
a little bit

19:56.230 --> 19:58.030
of stimulation
with these forceps.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.650
It simulates the predator
and makes him feel defensive.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.580
Oop, there it was.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.580
NARRATOR: While it is almost
imperceptible to the naked eye,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.630
with the high‐speed camera,

20:15.630 --> 20:18.880
the beetle can be seen
blasting rapid‐fire streams

20:18.880 --> 20:23.840
of deadly chemicals directed
at any would‐be predator.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.100
‐TSOUKALOS: Oh, wow! How cool!
‐PETER: There it goes!

20:26.100 --> 20:28.720
‐Projected it in that
particular direction. ‐Right.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.390
TSOUKALOS: You can actually
see the squirts,

20:32.390 --> 20:35.100
the mist, the vapor!

20:35.100 --> 20:36.980
The appendage which allows this
to happen can rotate.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.980
It can move back and forth,
so it can shoot this

20:39.980 --> 20:42.780
‐in lots of different
directions. ‐TSOUKALOS: Yeah.

20:42.780 --> 20:44.410
This is really awesome.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.870
NARRATOR:
Dr. Ward has set up

20:45.870 --> 20:47.280
‐a computer‐generated...
‐So here he is.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.370
...model
of the bombardier beetle

20:49.370 --> 20:52.370
to show Giorgio
the incredible process

20:52.370 --> 20:55.000
that is taking place
inside its body.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.920
WARD:
You've got

20:56.920 --> 20:59.750
the organs that produce
the chemicals, and two separate

20:59.750 --> 21:01.590
chemicals are being made.

21:01.590 --> 21:04.010
We've got this hydroquinone,

21:04.010 --> 21:06.390
which is actually a makeup
of the organics of the creature.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.510
It's part of his
external skeleton.

21:08.510 --> 21:11.020
The second one is a chemical
called hydrogen peroxide,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.890
which is rocket fuel.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.850
Now if we combine these two
together in a chamber,

21:15.850 --> 21:18.730
what we can do is build
this chemical material

21:18.730 --> 21:21.860
that's gonna get really hot and
blast out the back of the bug.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.280
So one of the coolest things
about this whole system,

21:24.280 --> 21:26.070
it's got a one‐way valve.

21:26.070 --> 21:28.570
Once this chemical concoction

21:28.570 --> 21:31.660
that's getting really hot
starts reacting,

21:31.660 --> 21:33.950
the last thing you want
is having it blast back

21:33.950 --> 21:35.620
into the interior of your body.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.580
So it can direct it,

21:37.580 --> 21:41.340
squirts out this super hot,
super toxic material

21:41.340 --> 21:43.170
into that predator's face.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.800
TSOUKALOS:
And one has to wonder,

21:44.800 --> 21:48.430
what was the evolutionary
process of this beetle

21:48.430 --> 21:52.430
for that defense mechanism
to even exist?

21:52.430 --> 21:54.600
WARD: Yeah, that's
the critical question.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.190
If evolution takes place
step‐by‐step,

21:57.190 --> 21:58.650
what's the intermediate?

21:58.650 --> 22:00.440
How does this thing
not blow itself up

22:00.440 --> 22:02.860
as it's experimenting
through time?

22:02.860 --> 22:06.280
How do you go from just
a garden‐variety beetle

22:06.280 --> 22:09.410
‐to a super beetle like this?
‐Mm‐hmm.

22:09.410 --> 22:12.240
TSOUKALOS:
One has to wonder

22:12.240 --> 22:14.660
if this creature perhaps

22:14.660 --> 22:17.790
was brought here
in its finished form,

22:17.790 --> 22:21.420
or at least the genetic material
for this creature

22:21.420 --> 22:24.420
came here as a finished product.

22:24.420 --> 22:26.470
NARRATOR:
Could the physiology

22:26.470 --> 22:29.130
of the bombardier beetle
be proof

22:29.130 --> 22:30.890
that there are animals
on this planet

22:30.890 --> 22:33.430
of extraterrestrial design?

22:33.430 --> 22:37.890
The gases that the beetle emits
can burn the skin of humans,

22:37.890 --> 22:40.770
and if the mechanism it holds
within its body

22:40.770 --> 22:43.690
was constructed
on a larger scale,

22:43.690 --> 22:47.070
it could be a very deadly
chemical weapon.

22:47.070 --> 22:51.160
Is it possible that aliens
placed certain creatures

22:51.160 --> 22:54.030
on this planet so that humans
could learn from them

22:54.030 --> 22:56.950
and recreate their abilities?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.210
KIRSTEN FISHER: Throughout
the animal kingdom

23:02.210 --> 23:05.710
there are other organisms that
also have tremendous abilities.

23:05.710 --> 23:08.880
The dung beetle

23:08.880 --> 23:12.300
is able to pull upwards of
1,100 times its body weight.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.440
The mantis shrimp,
they can see things like

23:19.440 --> 23:21.150
polarized light,

23:21.150 --> 23:24.570
UV, infrared light.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.030
Squids and octopus

23:27.030 --> 23:29.990
basically change their‐their
body coloration,

23:29.990 --> 23:32.240
and the patterns, and even
the texture of their skin

23:32.240 --> 23:34.740
as they move across
different substrates,

23:34.740 --> 23:36.160
which is just incredible.

23:38.410 --> 23:41.460
NARRATOR: Many advances
in human technology

23:41.460 --> 23:44.210
have been inspired
by the animal world,

23:44.210 --> 23:49.300
an approach scientists
refer to as biomimicry.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.840
Airplanes were designed

23:53.840 --> 23:56.060
to imitate the winged flight
of birds.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.270
(bird screeches)

23:58.270 --> 24:01.890
Military camouflage evolved

24:01.890 --> 24:05.690
out of observing
the way squid, octopuses,

24:05.690 --> 24:07.400
and chameleons
take on the appearance

24:07.400 --> 24:08.980
of their surroundings.

24:08.980 --> 24:13.160
Sonar used in the navigation

24:13.160 --> 24:17.530
of submarines and ships
is a skill taken from dolphins,

24:17.530 --> 24:21.540
whales, and bats,
who emit sound waves

24:21.540 --> 24:24.920
to locate both prey
and predators.

24:29.090 --> 24:31.920
WARD:
We have stolen

24:31.920 --> 24:34.680
so many attributes of animals
in the past

24:34.680 --> 24:36.970
for our own technologies.

24:36.970 --> 24:40.520
We're taking on this world‐view
of what an animal can do,

24:40.520 --> 24:43.190
and using technology
to rebuild it.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.900
WILCOCK: We're taking clues
from the natural world

24:47.900 --> 24:49.820
in order to develop
technologies.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.990
This may be part

24:51.990 --> 24:54.660
of a greater hidden
extraterrestrial initiative,

24:54.660 --> 24:58.080
perhaps for a seeding
of a technological

24:58.080 --> 25:01.540
and human revolution that we're
just starting to see now.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.210
NARRATOR:
Could extraterrestrial beings

25:04.210 --> 25:08.500
have intended for mankind to
study the other animals of Earth

25:08.500 --> 25:11.420
in order to advance
our technology,

25:11.420 --> 25:14.170
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

25:14.170 --> 25:18.760
And if so, is this the
continuation of an experiment

25:18.760 --> 25:21.430
that they have been conducting
with different life‐forms

25:21.430 --> 25:24.390
on Earth for thousands of years?

25:24.390 --> 25:28.560
Perhaps further clues
can be found

25:28.560 --> 25:30.940
by examining
the recent discovery

25:30.940 --> 25:32.650
that humans have not always been

25:32.650 --> 25:35.200
the most intelligent animal
on the planet.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.200
NARRATOR:
Barcelona, Spain.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.330
July 2016.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.970
Researchers studying the genome
of indigenous Australians

25:54.970 --> 25:57.970
living in the Andaman Islands

25:57.970 --> 26:00.890
uncover a mysterious strand
of DNA

26:00.890 --> 26:03.560
dating back 40,000 years‐‐

26:03.560 --> 26:07.600
a strand that is not human.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.900
Although they do not know what
species this DNA belongs to,

26:14.900 --> 26:17.910
they theorize
that if it co‐mingled

26:17.910 --> 26:19.950
with the DNA of humans,

26:19.950 --> 26:23.660
it would likely add one more
name to the ever‐growing list

26:23.660 --> 26:25.330
of intelligent hominid species

26:25.330 --> 26:29.290
that lived alongside
our ancestors.

26:29.290 --> 26:33.250
To date, archaeologists
have discovered

26:33.250 --> 26:36.510
that at least eight other
intelligent human‐like species

26:36.510 --> 26:39.640
have existed on Earth.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.510
One of the surprises of really
the last decade

26:42.510 --> 26:45.430
has been that now that we can
break into bones

26:45.430 --> 26:47.890
and extract ancient DNA,

26:47.890 --> 26:50.900
is‐‐ surprise, surprise‐‐

26:50.900 --> 26:54.150
that we seem to have been
interbreeding

26:54.150 --> 26:56.780
with creatures
that are not of our species.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.490
We've got pieces of DNA,

26:59.490 --> 27:04.200
these foreign, if you will,
non‐Homo sapiens DNA within us.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.450
HENRY:
This discovery adds

27:06.450 --> 27:09.000
to the ever‐growing list
of hominid species

27:09.000 --> 27:12.170
that were roaming around the
planet in the ancient world.

27:12.170 --> 27:14.130
And it brings up the question:

27:14.130 --> 27:17.510
Just how many other intelligent
species were there out there,

27:17.510 --> 27:20.800
that humans, as we know them,
were interacting with?

27:20.800 --> 27:24.100
Perhaps we're gonna discover
fossils of other versions

27:24.100 --> 27:27.140
of humanity that were mated,
or hybrid versions

27:27.140 --> 27:30.190
of other animals
that we have yet to discover.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.560
NARRATOR: How is it
that there were so many

27:33.560 --> 27:35.400
other intelligent
human‐like species

27:35.400 --> 27:37.070
that inhabited the planet

27:37.070 --> 27:38.860
thousands of years ago,

27:38.860 --> 27:42.570
but only humans remain today?

27:42.570 --> 27:46.160
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

27:46.160 --> 27:49.120
that Earth may have acted
as a laboratory,

27:49.120 --> 27:52.250
in which extraterrestrials
experimented

27:52.250 --> 27:55.040
with various life‐forms,
and as evidence,

27:55.040 --> 27:58.960
point to the numerous ancient
stories of hybrid creatures.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.590
YOUNG: Hybrid creatures
abound in mythology.

28:02.590 --> 28:05.970
All over the world
we get animals

28:05.970 --> 28:09.770
that are partly one thing,
partly another.

28:09.770 --> 28:13.100
In ancient Greek we hear about
the Cerberus,

28:13.100 --> 28:15.860
a terrifying three‐headed dog

28:15.860 --> 28:20.360
who was the guardian of
the portal to the underworld.

28:20.360 --> 28:25.660
The Greeks also had the centaur,
half human, half horse,

28:25.660 --> 28:29.700
a large and impressive creature.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.330
In Hindu mythology,
we have the Naga.

28:33.330 --> 28:36.130
These are strange‐looking
characters.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.300
Serpentine at the bottom,

28:38.300 --> 28:42.010
human torsos
and heads and faces.

28:42.010 --> 28:45.220
Even in the Qur'an,
the horse that was said

28:45.220 --> 28:49.100
to have flown Muhammad
from Mecca to Jerusalem

28:49.100 --> 28:54.020
was a flying horse
with a human face.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.810
Either it's all fantasy

28:56.810 --> 29:01.400
or our ancestors
witnessed these things,

29:01.400 --> 29:04.110
and if they witnessed them,
there's two options to that.

29:04.110 --> 29:08.950
Either these creatures
actually came here

29:08.950 --> 29:13.370
or whatever extraterrestrials
were here created them.

29:13.370 --> 29:16.420
And it's a huge, huge question,

29:16.420 --> 29:21.800
because both possibilities,
in my opinion, are possible.

29:24.550 --> 29:28.100
NARRATOR: If the hybrid
creatures described

29:28.100 --> 29:29.890
in ancient mythologies

29:29.890 --> 29:32.310
really did exist
alongside humans

29:32.310 --> 29:34.560
and other intelligent hominids,

29:34.560 --> 29:37.440
is it possible that
Charles Darwin's theory

29:37.440 --> 29:39.520
of natural selection
played a role

29:39.520 --> 29:42.400
in the rise of humans after all?

29:42.400 --> 29:46.660
Could it be a case of
alien intervention on Earth

29:46.660 --> 29:48.910
creating numerous species

29:48.910 --> 29:52.080
that were then forced to fight
for survival?

29:52.080 --> 29:55.580
Perhaps further clues
can be found

29:55.580 --> 29:58.540
by examining stories
of an ancient cataclysm

29:58.540 --> 30:03.550
often referred to
as the Great Flood.

30:03.550 --> 30:06.010
The Bible teaches us
an ancient legend

30:06.010 --> 30:08.890
that there was a global flood.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.810
We all know that the sins
of the people

30:12.810 --> 30:16.020
would cause God to intervene.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.940
But yet, the legends tell us

30:18.940 --> 30:23.070
that the actual problem
that occurred at this time

30:23.070 --> 30:26.820
was an
extraterrestrial involvement

30:26.820 --> 30:30.320
and manipulation
of human genetics.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.490
The Bible speaks in Genesis,
chapter six,

30:33.490 --> 30:38.120
of the sons of God
who came down from heaven

30:38.120 --> 30:42.920
and took the daughters
of men as wives

30:42.920 --> 30:45.920
from which were born
a race of titans.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.840
<i>Gibborim</i> is the Hebrew word.

30:48.840 --> 30:54.890
And that they unleashed terror,
havoc upon the world.

30:54.890 --> 30:58.690
The Books of Enoch teach us
that these sons of God

30:58.690 --> 31:02.270
were the angels
who came down from heaven.

31:02.270 --> 31:04.400
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
The development was going

31:04.400 --> 31:06.570
the wrong direction.

31:06.570 --> 31:10.820
And then they decided to start
the whole experiment again.

31:10.820 --> 31:14.030
They decided to create
a great flood.

31:14.030 --> 31:17.290
(lightning cracks,
thunder rumbles)

31:17.290 --> 31:20.000
We have stories
of the Great Flood

31:20.000 --> 31:21.920
practically all over the world.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.630
Not only in the Bible,

31:23.630 --> 31:25.750
not only in the Gilgamesh epics,

31:25.750 --> 31:28.720
not only in the <i>Enûma Eli.</i>
from the Sumerian.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.090
We have it in Central America
among the Mayans.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.640
We have it in South America

31:32.640 --> 31:34.760
among the Kogi Indians.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.140
They live in Colombia.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.100
Always the Great Flood story.

31:38.100 --> 31:41.980
But in every case,
there was a so‐called god

31:41.980 --> 31:45.980
who give instructions
to construct a ship.

31:45.980 --> 31:48.570
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK: And
this is where ancient legends

31:48.570 --> 31:50.400
get very interesting,

31:50.400 --> 31:52.820
because while Noah
was building his ark

31:52.820 --> 31:55.410
and saving his animals,

31:55.410 --> 31:58.870
other legends say
that others of his generation

31:58.870 --> 32:01.250
took other precautions.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.960
Some building
other types of ships,

32:03.960 --> 32:06.800
which were to go to the stars.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.130
And what is also interesting

32:11.130 --> 32:13.220
is that the legends tell us

32:13.220 --> 32:17.350
that not all animals
were included on Noah's ark.

32:17.350 --> 32:21.270
NARRATOR: Does the story
of the Great Flood

32:21.270 --> 32:23.060
provide evidence

32:23.060 --> 32:25.360
that extraterrestrials
have been experimenting

32:25.360 --> 32:27.150
with different life‐forms
on Earth

32:27.150 --> 32:30.190
for thousands of years?

32:30.190 --> 32:33.240
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

32:33.240 --> 32:36.160
that such experimentation
continues to this day,

32:36.160 --> 32:39.620
but that it is now
being directed

32:39.620 --> 32:41.960
by humans.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.590
NARRATOR:
Rapallo, Italy.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.510
1988.

32:54.970 --> 32:58.010
While studying marine life
off the coast of Italy,

32:58.010 --> 33:00.680
German biology student
Christian Sommer

33:00.680 --> 33:03.730
discovers a microscopic species

33:03.730 --> 33:06.810
with an incredible ability:

33:06.810 --> 33:10.940
it never dies.

33:10.940 --> 33:15.820
The animal, a jellyfish
called <i>Turritopsis dohrnii,</i>

33:15.820 --> 33:19.530
repeatedly reverts back
to its earliest polyp state

33:19.530 --> 33:23.250
and begins its life cycle
over and over again.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.840
WILCOCK: Now, there's
something strange going on here.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.710
There's something

33:30.710 --> 33:33.090
that doesn't appear to happen
in any other life‐form

33:33.090 --> 33:35.130
that we've ever identified

33:35.130 --> 33:37.930
in the millions and millions
of different creatures

33:37.930 --> 33:39.300
that live on Earth.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.310
There is no theoretical limit

33:41.310 --> 33:45.100
to how much this creature
is able to recycle itself.

33:45.100 --> 33:49.110
That completely defies all
known scientific laws of biology

33:49.110 --> 33:50.610
as we now see them.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.490
NARRATOR: Scientists
have nicknamed the species

33:56.490 --> 33:58.370
"the immortal jellyfish"

33:58.370 --> 34:02.740
and are attempting to unlock
its biological secrets

34:02.740 --> 34:04.540
in the hopes
that they may hold the key

34:04.540 --> 34:07.670
to increasing
the lifespan of humans.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.170
But how
did such an incredible creature

34:10.170 --> 34:13.050
come to exist
in the first place?

34:13.050 --> 34:15.800
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

34:15.800 --> 34:19.180
that extraterrestrials
may still be seeding our planet

34:19.180 --> 34:21.350
with new life‐forms
to help direct

34:21.350 --> 34:23.720
the path of mankind's evolution.

34:26.640 --> 34:30.230
The idea that life on Earth

34:30.230 --> 34:32.440
may have an otherworldly origin

34:32.440 --> 34:37.490
has fascinated mankind
for thousands of years.

34:37.490 --> 34:40.870
It was first proposed
in the fifth century BC

34:40.870 --> 34:44.540
by Greek philosopher Anaxagoras.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.040
He believed
that all living things

34:47.040 --> 34:48.620
came from cosmic seeds

34:48.620 --> 34:51.170
scattered
throughout the universe.

34:51.170 --> 34:55.170
He called the concept
panspermia.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.550
Significant thinkers
throughout the ages

34:57.550 --> 34:59.590
have considered
this possibility:

34:59.590 --> 35:02.890
Anaxagoras in ancient Greece,

35:02.890 --> 35:06.100
Lord Kelvin, Fred Hoyle,

35:06.100 --> 35:09.270
Francis Crick,
the codiscoverer of DNA‐‐

35:09.270 --> 35:11.810
who, by the way, thought
that it was too complicated

35:11.810 --> 35:14.190
to have been developed
on Earth alone‐‐

35:14.190 --> 35:16.320
up to Stephen Hawking,
in our time,

35:16.320 --> 35:18.190
have considered this idea

35:18.190 --> 35:21.620
that life came
from beyond the planet.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.830
WILCOCK:
Is it also possible

35:28.830 --> 35:31.880
that what we're looking at
is a series of ETs

35:31.880 --> 35:33.130
that might
have been visiting Earth

35:33.130 --> 35:34.960
for hundreds
of thousands of years

35:34.960 --> 35:38.130
and have been
systematically dropping off

35:38.130 --> 35:40.340
some of their favorite creatures

35:40.340 --> 35:43.510
from other biological worlds
very similar to our own

35:43.510 --> 35:45.720
that have certain
special ingredients

35:45.720 --> 35:49.020
so that once we reached
a certain level of technology,

35:49.020 --> 35:52.310
we could adapt those qualities
into our own life.

35:54.690 --> 35:58.530
NARRATOR: Is humanity
still under the influence

35:58.530 --> 36:02.910
of animals introduced to Earth
by otherworldly beings?

36:02.910 --> 36:06.830
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

36:06.830 --> 36:10.710
and suggest
that we are beginning to become

36:10.710 --> 36:12.540
like our alien ancestors,

36:12.540 --> 36:14.170
playing a hand in the evolution

36:14.170 --> 36:17.500
of life on Earth.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.720
WARD: One of the cutting edges
of biology now

36:20.720 --> 36:23.590
is we are taking
human stem cells, putting them

36:23.590 --> 36:26.220
into embryos of animals

36:26.220 --> 36:28.600
and then hoping that it becomes
a human organ itself.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.230
So, this is a lot
of experimentation.

36:31.230 --> 36:35.360
We can take a DNA molecule

36:35.360 --> 36:38.110
within an animal

36:38.110 --> 36:40.530
and knock out specific genes.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.360
We've been able to do that
for a while.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.610
But now we're able
to replace them

36:44.610 --> 36:47.370
with specific genes
for the very first time,

36:47.370 --> 36:50.790
which is unleashing
lots of Frankenstein monsters.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.670
Right now, what we've seen,

36:54.670 --> 36:58.420
the most interesting and, to me,
scary example of this

36:58.420 --> 36:59.920
comes from China,

36:59.920 --> 37:02.420
where they have taken
a single gene,

37:02.420 --> 37:04.930
inserted it into a beagle

37:04.930 --> 37:08.470
and caused that beagle
to have twice the musculature

37:08.470 --> 37:10.270
than it otherwise would have.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.690
These things
are, like, super beagles.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.730
And that begs the question:
if you can do it to a beagle,

37:15.730 --> 37:17.150
can you do it to a human?

37:17.150 --> 37:18.270
Absolutely.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.940
WILCOCK:
This could be the first step

37:22.940 --> 37:25.160
of a revolution in biology

37:25.160 --> 37:28.620
that leads to us starting
to have the type of abilities

37:28.620 --> 37:31.240
that are commonly reported
in the ancient lore

37:31.240 --> 37:33.750
of extraterrestrial gods
visiting Earth.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.040
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

37:38.040 --> 37:40.210
that mankind is beginning
to reach the level

37:40.210 --> 37:41.590
of our alien ancestors,

37:41.590 --> 37:45.380
as ancient astronaut theorists
propose?

37:45.380 --> 37:49.220
And do they continue
to assist us in this process,

37:49.220 --> 37:51.180
secretly introducing

37:51.180 --> 37:54.270
incredible new life‐forms
on Earth?

37:54.270 --> 37:57.310
Perhaps further clues
can be found

37:57.310 --> 37:59.940
by examining
a new scientific endeavor

37:59.940 --> 38:01.940
to seed Earth life

38:01.940 --> 38:03.490
on other planets.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.500
NARRATOR:
Frankfurt, Germany.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.040
September 2016.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.670
German physicist
Dr. Claudius Gros

38:20.670 --> 38:24.340
of the Institute of Theoretical
Physics at Goethe University

38:24.340 --> 38:28.680
introduces a new theory
titled the Genesis Project,

38:28.680 --> 38:31.140
which proposes that mankind

38:31.140 --> 38:34.140
should not simply search
for life on distant planets,

38:34.140 --> 38:36.430
but create it.

38:36.430 --> 38:39.810
CLAUDIUS GROS:
So, in exoplanetary research,

38:39.810 --> 38:41.520
we have realized now

38:41.520 --> 38:43.110
that there will be planets

38:43.110 --> 38:45.900
which will be habitable
but lifeless.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.320
And normally, people believe,
well, that is bad luck

38:49.320 --> 38:51.280
because we are looking
for a second Earth.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.580
But it offers us
a new opportunity

38:54.580 --> 38:57.080
maybe to bring life
to these planets.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.170
NARRATOR:
The Genesis Project

38:59.170 --> 39:02.040
calls for depositing
single‐cell living organisms

39:02.040 --> 39:04.630
onto lifeless planets.

39:04.630 --> 39:07.380
WARD: If you really want
to kick‐start this thing,

39:07.380 --> 39:10.680
you find
an already oxygenated world.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.550
And then you can put out

39:12.550 --> 39:14.600
cells such as ours
that have a big nucleus

39:14.600 --> 39:17.770
that can move directly
into an animal grade,

39:17.770 --> 39:19.560
which is multicellular.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.570
CHILDRESS:
In a sense, this kind of seeding

39:23.570 --> 39:26.320
that Professor Gros
is wanting to do

39:26.320 --> 39:27.860
in the near future

39:27.860 --> 39:30.280
is exactly the kind of thing

39:30.280 --> 39:33.070
that extraterrestrials
would have probably have done

39:33.070 --> 39:34.660
in the remote past.

39:34.660 --> 39:37.410
NARRATOR:
In planning to transmit life

39:37.410 --> 39:39.710
to other planets,
are humans today

39:39.710 --> 39:43.460
replicating what
extraterrestrials did on Earth?

39:43.460 --> 39:46.090
Are we continuing a cycle

39:46.090 --> 39:48.760
that has been taking place
throughout the universe

39:48.760 --> 39:52.090
for many millions of years?

39:52.090 --> 39:55.140
The fossil record,
while it's there,

39:55.140 --> 39:57.430
doesn't necessarily correspond

39:57.430 --> 39:59.770
to Darwinian evolution

39:59.770 --> 40:04.520
because you don't see
the transitional creatures

40:04.520 --> 40:07.150
in between whatever evolution
there may have been.

40:07.150 --> 40:11.990
So this suggests, to me,
an outside influence,

40:11.990 --> 40:14.910
whether it was panspermia,

40:14.910 --> 40:17.870
direct panspermia

40:17.870 --> 40:21.080
or, later, the artificial
mutation of our genes

40:21.080 --> 40:23.370
by extraterrestrials.

40:23.370 --> 40:26.590
I think, in fact, it may be
a combination of all three.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.670
JASON MARTELL:
It's very possible

40:28.670 --> 40:31.670
that there have been
lost cultures and species

40:31.670 --> 40:33.970
that have literally evolved
and left the planet.

40:33.970 --> 40:36.800
When we look at the various
races of extraterrestrials

40:36.800 --> 40:38.770
that are possibly
visiting us today,

40:38.770 --> 40:40.390
there could be some connection

40:40.390 --> 40:43.440
to various species
here on Earth.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.480
With all
of these incredible stories

40:45.480 --> 40:49.030
of ancient human‐animal hybrids

40:49.030 --> 40:51.360
and strange creatures
coming from the stars

40:51.360 --> 40:54.240
coupled with modern stories
of people

40:54.240 --> 40:55.740
that have had experiences

40:55.740 --> 40:58.580
with animalistic‐type
extraterrestrials,

40:58.580 --> 41:01.750
we have to ask if Earth
is some kind of a laboratory

41:01.750 --> 41:03.120
where extraterrestrials
are experimenting

41:03.120 --> 41:04.710
with various species,

41:04.710 --> 41:06.710
trying to come up
with different beings.

41:06.710 --> 41:10.130
When we look out into
the cosmos, we have to ask:

41:10.130 --> 41:12.010
is it filled with beings

41:12.010 --> 41:13.420
of different
animalistic characteristics?

41:16.720 --> 41:19.100
And as we begin
to meet these beings,

41:19.100 --> 41:21.850
are we meeting
with past versions of ourselves

41:21.850 --> 41:24.890
or perhaps future versions
of ourselves?

41:24.890 --> 41:27.900
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

41:27.900 --> 41:30.940
that extraterrestrials
seeded the Earth

41:30.940 --> 41:34.110
and continue to use it
as a genetic laboratory

41:34.110 --> 41:38.240
in which humans are just one
of many experiments?

41:38.240 --> 41:41.700
If so,
could there be another species

41:41.700 --> 41:43.710
destined to overtake us?

41:43.710 --> 41:45.920
Or are we in the process

41:45.920 --> 41:48.790
of merging other animals
with ourselves

41:48.790 --> 41:52.760
to become
more like our alien ancestors?

41:52.760 --> 41:57.050
Perhaps one day soon,
we will learn

41:57.050 --> 41:58.590
that such genetic manipulation

41:58.590 --> 42:01.390
is happening not only on Earth,

42:01.390 --> 42:04.160
but throughout the universe.
