WEBVTT

00:04.792 --> 00:08.041
Let's start off with a toughie.
Who can tell me--

00:08.125 --> 00:10.917
(J.D.) <i>Over the last few weeks,</i>
<i>the most amazing thing has happened.</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:12.458
<i>I've been nailing rounds.</i>

00:12.542 --> 00:15.083
<i>I think I'm actually starting</i>
<i>to separate myself from the pack.</i>

00:15.166 --> 00:17.000
Sir, the answer is Beck's triad.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.959
(gunshot)

00:19.041 --> 00:21.208
(J.D.)
<i>It keeps me on top of my game.</i>

00:21.291 --> 00:23.917
Looks like a break in the ulna.
Right there.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.417
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

00:26.250 --> 00:29.709
You know, it's, it's ok
to be impressed by me.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.417
Most girls are.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.125
<i>The only problem with reaching</i>
<i>the top is that sooner or later,</i>

00:34.208 --> 00:36.333
<i>someone starts nipping at your heels.</i>

00:36.417 --> 00:39.166
<i>For me,</i>
<i>that guy was Nick Murdoch.</i>

00:39.250 --> 00:42.041
(angels singing)

00:42.125 --> 00:47.625
-Wow!
-Well, the gurney adds drama.

00:47.709 --> 00:51.208
<i>♪ I can't do this</i>
<i>All on my own ♪</i>

00:51.291 --> 00:54.542
<i>♪ No, I'm know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman ♪</i>

00:57.917 --> 00:59.542
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

01:06.041 --> 01:08.625
(J.D.) <i>So that's the guy</i>
<i>who wants to take me down.</i>

01:08.709 --> 01:10.417
Of course you're gonna
have a scar, Peter.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.834
I mean, you're not
getting any surgery,

01:12.917 --> 01:14.458
but chicks dig scars,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.458
so I think I'm gonna
give you one anyway.

01:17.333 --> 01:21.208
Doctor, Peter's drug rash
is getting a lot worse.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.291
No problem. Just give him
Prednisone and Benadryl.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.250
(J.D.) <i>Good bedside manner,</i>
<i>good rapport with the nurses...</i>

01:26.333 --> 01:30.083
<i>Sees me staring at him.</i>
<i>Act busy.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:33.375
That's the...
that's the stud right there.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.041
That's where you'd...
Hang a painting.

01:36.125 --> 01:38.083
He was born John Dorian,

01:38.166 --> 01:43.834
but he was simply known
as J.D., doctor, friend, lover.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.959
-Hey, man, how are you?
-Hey, how are you? Oh, ok.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.458
There, there that is.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.750
Gosh, can you believe we're doctors?

01:51.834 --> 01:55.583
The other night, I'm at a restaurant,
and this guy starts choking.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.583
They asked if anyone was a doctor.
I didn't even move.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.041
Yeah, I know it.
I still feel like I'm 7 years old,

02:01.125 --> 02:03.500
playing<i> M.A.S.H.</i>
with my older brother.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.291
I don't want to be Hot Lips again.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.291
(brother) Shut up and kiss Frank.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.500
I don't talk to my brother much.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.542
(J.D.) <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Don't connect with him.</i>

02:15.625 --> 02:17.583
-Well, I'll see you.
-Ok.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.500
Hey, whatever happened to the guy
in the restaurant?

02:20.583 --> 02:23.500
Oh, eventually I remembered
I was a doctor.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.375
Of course,
he'd been dead for 20 minutes.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.000
Very embarrassing.
Food was good, though.

02:28.709 --> 02:31.375
(J.D.) <i>Don't laugh. Don't laugh.</i>

02:31.458 --> 02:32.667
Heh heh heh.

02:32.750 --> 02:33.667
(J.D.) <i>Damn!</i>

02:33.750 --> 02:35.041
Hi.

02:35.125 --> 02:39.291
Anytime you want to get more gauze,
it'd be a real treat for all of us.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.959
-It's hard being you, isn't it?
-It is.

02:44.417 --> 02:45.375
What's with the smile?

02:45.458 --> 02:49.000
This whole big-bad-wolf thing.
It's such an act.

02:50.333 --> 02:54.000
Neato. Well, now what do you want, a tip?
Get out.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.709
(whistles) Go, go, go!

02:56.875 --> 02:57.959
I'm not sure I agree.

02:58.041 --> 03:02.959
(hip hop music playing)

03:07.583 --> 03:09.417
-(Todd) You good, T-dog?
-(Turk) Oh, come on, man.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.208
I can do this with my eyes closed.

03:12.750 --> 03:16.083
-I won't though.
-(Dr. Wen) Open the peritoneum.

03:16.166 --> 03:21.166
Nice, clean cut. Good, good.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.333
Whoa, whoa! What's that smell?

03:24.125 --> 03:25.291
(Turk) I don't know.

03:25.375 --> 03:28.250
-(Dr. Wen) Did you Nick the colon?
-(Turk) No. I mean, I don't know.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.291
I... I... I don't think so. Did I?

03:30.375 --> 03:32.208
(Dr. Wen) Cut the music!

03:32.291 --> 03:34.500
You know,
I kind of had a date last night.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.667
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.375
A guy on the bus fell asleep on me
and drooled on my shoulder.

03:40.458 --> 03:41.583
You slut.

03:43.208 --> 03:47.333
-What about Nick?
-Oh, I'd let him drool on me.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.083
Oh, that's gross.
Why did I say that?

03:49.166 --> 03:51.166
I... I shouldn't talk to people.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.875
Besides, I wouldn't know what to do
even if I was interested.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.834
Well, you could start
by looking at him.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.166
Did he look back? Does he like me?
Why doesn't he like me?

04:01.250 --> 04:03.166
I can't believe I already blew it.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.333
(J.D.) <i>It felt weird</i>
<i>trying to push Nick on her.</i>

04:05.417 --> 04:07.667
<i>I mean, this morning</i>
<i>I wanted to kill the guy.</i>

04:07.750 --> 04:10.208
<i>But the truth is, he's so nice,</i>
<i>he probably would've helped me.</i>

04:10.792 --> 04:13.000
Come on, J.D.
You're not closing the windpipe.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.041
You got to put more pressure down here.

04:15.125 --> 04:19.000
Come on! I know you can do it!
Come on! Come on!

04:19.083 --> 04:22.959
Ah, if it isn't the brain trust.

04:23.041 --> 04:26.000
Someone tell me
what this patient's rash is.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.458
You have until I finish my Squeezy-juice.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.208
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my God, I'm drawing a...</i>

04:31.291 --> 04:34.542
<i>Oh, my God, I can't even remember what</i>
<i>you draw when your mind draws a...</i>

04:34.625 --> 04:38.000
<i>-Something.</i>
-It's erythema migrans.

04:38.083 --> 04:41.291
-Then why don't you just answer it?
-Everyone looks up to you.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.458
It's important to them
that you don't get stumped.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.834
Besides, come on.
It's important to you, too.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.959
(J.D.)
<i>Please, like he knows me.</i>

04:49.041 --> 04:51.542
It's erythema migrans, sir.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.417
-(gunshot)
-Right you are, Dr. Dorian.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.667
Nice.

04:56.750 --> 05:00.208
Ok. There you go.
Now you've got it.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.125
Oh, good.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.250
(Dr. Wen)
I don't know where that smell came from.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.917
(Todd) Uh, sir?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.417
(Dr. Wen) What is it?
Do you see something?

05:08.500 --> 05:12.834
(Todd) Sir, I farted.
That smell is from the fart that I made.

05:12.917 --> 05:17.083
-(Turk) Dude.
-(Dr. Wen) Get the hell out of my O.R.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.959
(Todd) Yes, sir! Good.

05:20.583 --> 05:23.458
(J.D.) <i>Time to put myself</i>
<i>right back on top of Nick.</i>

05:24.291 --> 05:25.667
<i>That came out wrong.</i>

05:25.750 --> 05:29.291
Excuse me, Dr. Cox? I... I know
that you need to pick an intern

05:29.375 --> 05:31.458
to co-write that case report
on postpartum hemolytic--

05:31.542 --> 05:34.417
Yeah, sure. Congratulations.
Now... go.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.250
(J.D.) <i>Mission accomplished.</i>

05:36.333 --> 05:38.542
Hey, buddy. How are ya?

05:38.625 --> 05:43.917
Uh, Dr. Cox, I was wondering if I could
co-write that case report with you.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.625
Wow. This is good.
<i>Newbie á newbie.</i>

05:46.709 --> 05:48.458
Too bad it can't be
a fight to the death.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.792
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't know
you wanted to do it.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.959
-You do it. You'll be great.
-Well, I... oh, ok.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.250
Hey, you, cut it out.
Nice guys aren't even that nice.

05:55.333 --> 05:59.458
Now, let me see.
Just exactly who to choose...

05:59.542 --> 06:01.250
Who to choose?

06:04.583 --> 06:06.583
(squeak, creak)

06:06.667 --> 06:07.875
(squeak, squeak)

06:07.959 --> 06:09.500
(boom boom boom)

06:10.208 --> 06:11.375
(rusty door opening)

06:11.458 --> 06:12.834
(squeak squeak)

06:12.917 --> 06:15.500
Nice. Yeah. Ok, over.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.417
(bells jingle)

06:18.500 --> 06:21.959
Ohh, interesting.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.750
Uh-huh.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.709
That a boy.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.166
I'm gonna go with...

06:28.250 --> 06:30.083
Guy smiley here.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.417
-Wow.
-Yeah, wow.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.875
-Huge moment for me.
-I know.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.917
I wish my dad was alive.

06:40.041 --> 06:41.959
(J.D.) <i>Doesn't mean anything.</i>

06:42.041 --> 06:44.166
So what, you just, like, flipped a coin
in your head or...?

06:44.250 --> 06:46.792
No. It's just that right now,

06:46.875 --> 06:49.417
he's better at internal medicine
than you are.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.917
Ok. Go, you know,
insult me like you always do.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.417
Too easy.
When you least expect it.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.583
Dr. Wen threatened to sew
my butt cheeks together.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.709
And yet you continue to eat chili.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.709
Dude, I'm taking the cheese off.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.041
You know, even though
nothing happened today,

07:13.125 --> 07:15.667
-it still kind of freaked me out.
-Mm-hmm.

07:15.750 --> 07:19.625
One flinch, one hiccup, and that's
the difference between life and death.

07:19.709 --> 07:21.250
That's a lot to have on your shoulders,
you know?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.083
Unh.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.375
Hey!

07:26.125 --> 07:27.917
What are you guys talking about?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.166
Cheese.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.333
Turk is so lucky I met him first.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.375
How's my man doing?

07:36.458 --> 07:42.458
Baby, most guys are here,
but me, I'm like all up in here.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.375
(Dr. Wen) Dr. Turk,
you can make the incision now.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.834
Sir, um... My hand's tightening up.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.792
I must be low on potassium.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.750
(Dr. Wen) All right. I'll take over.

07:59.291 --> 08:02.000
Dr. Murdoch, Peter's rash is gone,

08:02.083 --> 08:04.250
but he's vomited six times
in the last hour.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.792
No problem. Just give him Zofran

08:05.875 --> 08:08.417
and a 20 C.C. per kilo
bolus of normal saline.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.291
(J.D.) <i>I think everyone's finally coming</i>
<i>around to my way of thinking about Nick.</i>

08:12.375 --> 08:15.542
You're right.
He definitely has a cute little butt.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.291
Oh, it's almost like it's been sculpted.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.625
Who cares? Everybody's got a cute butt.
I have a cute butt.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.500
You should bring it in some day.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.250
(Carla laughs)

08:26.458 --> 08:29.542
-Hey, how's Turk doing?
-He's fine. Why?

08:29.625 --> 08:31.583
Because he totally froze
during surgery yesterday.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.875
-Didn't he tell you?
-Mm-mmm.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.917
-Hey, you!
-Hey, hey.

08:36.875 --> 08:40.875
I feel like we haven't talked in ages.
How are you?

08:41.667 --> 08:43.083
-Fine.
-Yeah?

08:43.166 --> 08:45.834
-Don't I look ok?
-You know, you know.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.375
You know? I'm fine.
As a matter of fact,

08:54.458 --> 08:58.709
<i>♪ I am doing ok</i>
<i>Dah! ♪</i>

09:00.542 --> 09:03.083
Good afternoon, doctors.

09:03.166 --> 09:06.583
I gathered you all here
because, well...

09:06.667 --> 09:11.208
Attendance at my noon conferences
has been very disappointing.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.917
In fact, I've begun to wonder

09:13.000 --> 09:16.542
if maybe you have something
more important to do.

09:17.250 --> 09:22.291
Maybe you feel the need to sneak off
and have a little nappy-nap.

09:22.375 --> 09:25.333
I love nappy-naps.

09:25.417 --> 09:31.000
Or maybe you've forgotten
that my conferences are mandatory.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.875
My hospital, my rules!

09:33.667 --> 09:35.333
Actually, sir, I've never missed one.

09:35.417 --> 09:37.417
I'm just, uh,
batting a thousand over here.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.625
(gunshot)

09:38.709 --> 09:42.542
Son, I'm more proud of you
than I've ever been of an intern.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.834
(J.D.)
<i>How do you like me now, Nick?</i>

09:44.917 --> 09:48.875
So you see, sir,
the poor attendance is my fault,

09:48.959 --> 09:50.375
and my fault only.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.542
Well, then,
you have just won the privilege

09:53.625 --> 09:57.917
of writing my next 10 lectures by...
this afternoon.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.125
Paging Dr. Martyr.
Heh heh heh.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.375
I mean,
what the hell was that guy...

10:05.458 --> 10:06.750
-(intern) Way to go, Nick.
-(second intern) Dude!

10:06.834 --> 10:09.041
Nick, that was amazing.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.125
Ah, well...

10:11.208 --> 10:12.583
(J.D.) <i>Thinking.</i>

10:16.458 --> 10:18.834
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

10:24.875 --> 10:27.458
(J.D.) <i>Things change</i>
<i>when you're not the star anymore.</i>

10:27.542 --> 10:29.166
(gunshot)

10:30.375 --> 10:35.000
What can I say? The lectures
this kid wrote for me were fantastic.

10:35.083 --> 10:38.792
(J.D.) <i>The hospital starts to seem</i>
<i>like a whole different place.</i>

10:38.875 --> 10:41.542
(wind howling)

10:41.625 --> 10:44.417
Hey, man. Want some company?

10:45.542 --> 10:48.959
Naw. I just want to be alone.

10:52.625 --> 10:53.625
Well?

10:53.709 --> 10:56.083
Not yet, but soon...

10:56.166 --> 10:57.375
(cracking)

10:57.458 --> 10:58.917
Very soon.

11:02.291 --> 11:05.583
Why would Turk talk to Elliot
about this and not me anyway?

11:05.667 --> 11:07.500
They're not even friends.
You know what I mean?

11:07.583 --> 11:10.917
After 25 minutes, the only way I could
know what you mean more

11:11.000 --> 11:13.166
is if you wrote, "My boyfriend
doesn't open up to me"

11:13.250 --> 11:14.291
on a big wooden mallet

11:14.375 --> 11:17.166
and repeatedly smashed me
over the head with it.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.041
Why can't you just for once
dig deep down into your heart,

11:20.125 --> 11:22.709
access some emotions,
and empathize with me?

11:25.250 --> 11:26.834
I'm sorry. What were we doing?

11:26.917 --> 11:28.750
See? That's why no one likes you.

11:28.834 --> 11:35.291
Hey, you like me a little bit,
and so do you, sweetcakes, huh?

11:37.375 --> 11:39.000
Want a little sugar from daddy?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.959
Well, looky here.

11:43.041 --> 11:46.917
I thought this was my special place.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.792
I'd ask you not to tell any of the others
about this spot,

11:49.875 --> 11:51.834
but none of them seem
to be talking to you.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.875
Oh, it's been a rough day, sir.

11:55.083 --> 11:59.792
You see, Dr. Dorian,
your problem is you're a pansy.

12:00.458 --> 12:05.333
If you were in my way,
I'd throw you off this ledge right now.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.500
We're out here alone.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.709
No one would ever know.

12:20.250 --> 12:24.667
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna... I have to... things.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Ha ha ha ha!

12:29.083 --> 12:31.875
Interns are fun.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.333
(man on PA) <i>Dr. Dooley, 3153.</i>

12:34.417 --> 12:35.375
I'm single.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.917
That was more subtle in my head.

12:39.917 --> 12:44.375
Relax. I already left a message
on your machine asking you out.

12:44.458 --> 12:45.667
-(Eliot) Really?
-No.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.208
But I promise I will
before you go home.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.792
Works for me.

12:50.875 --> 12:55.458
Dr. Murdoch, Peter's developed
a high-grade fever and a cough.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.000
No problem. Just give him
Ceftazidime one gram I.V.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.750
How do you stay so positive?

12:59.834 --> 13:02.000
I guess I don't let the bad stuff in,
you know,

13:02.083 --> 13:03.750
try not to get too overwhelmed.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.583
Call me tonight
when you get my message.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.333
Ok.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.208
Mm-hmm.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.500
-His butt?
-Mm-hmm.

13:16.250 --> 13:20.375
So listen, I scheduled an appendectomy
for you later.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.166
Just make sure you're good
on potassium.

13:22.250 --> 13:26.291
Sir, I got so much potassium,
it's coming out of my ass-ium.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.208
You know what I mean?
(chuckles)

13:29.792 --> 13:31.875
See, what I did was,
I took the word potassium,

13:31.959 --> 13:35.834
and... I dropped the first 3 letters...

13:35.917 --> 13:37.458
And made a doody joke.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.417
Funny stuff.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.125
Looks like he bought it.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.959
Excuse me?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.875
So you had a little stage fright.
It's no big deal.

13:46.959 --> 13:50.041
-Happened to me once.
-Really?

13:50.125 --> 13:52.417
I'd be more than glad to tell you what
a lot of doctors do

13:52.500 --> 13:54.625
to relieve the stress.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.125
Just take a little trip to<i> Palmdale.</i>

13:57.208 --> 14:01.041
-What?
-Ok. Give yourself the old low five.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.291
I'm not getting it.

14:02.375 --> 14:06.000
Physician... Love thyself.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.709
Are you talking about
downtown Lester Brown?

14:09.792 --> 14:12.375
Lowers the heart rate,
releases the endorphins.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.041
It's basic physiology.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.000
Pfft! Heh! Ha!

14:16.083 --> 14:17.959
Ok. You almost had me.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.166
Heh. Ha ha.
You're not serious.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.417
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.917
-Yes.
-No.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.208
Huh! Hmm.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
Nobody hurts Carla
and gets away with it.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.375
Who's Carla?

14:31.458 --> 14:33.166
I was talking to myself.
Don't eavesdrop.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.542
If this kid doesn't leave,
I'm gonna kill him.

14:37.750 --> 14:41.917
(whistles) Now, if you leave,
I'll know you were eavesdropping.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.542
I'll just go ahead
and kill you anyway. Stay.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.250
Good girl.

14:49.417 --> 14:51.667
Tick-tock, Clarice.

don't look good at all.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.041
No problem.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.333
Listen, I was thinking about
what happened earlier,

16:39.417 --> 16:44.000
and... anyway, uh, here.

16:44.083 --> 16:48.041
Wow. You finally dug
deep down in your heart

16:48.125 --> 16:49.041
and came up with a muffin.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.375
That's store-bought, sister.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.542
There's blueberries in there the size
of your fist.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.750
I shouldn't have dragged
you into it, anyway.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.208
You don't even know Turk.

16:56.291 --> 17:00.959
Actually, I met him today.
We had a terrific chat.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.917
Whew!

17:03.000 --> 17:07.208
Oh, give the man a hand.
That's just terrific work.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.417
You know darn well that felt good.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.959
And you're feeling better about yourself
now, aren't you?

17:12.041 --> 17:14.083
Real nice guy.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.959
It's hard letting yourself
be vulnerable with someone, you know?

17:18.041 --> 17:20.625
Just eat the damn muffin,
would you, please?

17:25.333 --> 17:26.959
You know what?
Even though I'm on call tonight,

17:27.041 --> 17:28.667
I'm not gonna let the bad stuff
in anymore.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.834
I'm not gonna let myself
get overwhelmed. What?

17:31.917 --> 17:34.166
Well, it's just that Friday night
when you had people over

17:34.250 --> 17:37.083
you locked yourself in your room
because we brought the wrong chips.

17:37.166 --> 17:41.208
Look at me.
That was the old Elliot.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.166
Hey, can you help me find Dr. Murdoch?

17:43.250 --> 17:45.583
Peter's parents are here,
and he's not answering his page.

17:45.667 --> 17:49.583
Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna
let herself be overwhelmed anymore.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.750
(chuckles)

17:54.834 --> 17:58.667
(Nurse Roberts cackles)

18:00.875 --> 18:02.583
She's been drinking.

18:06.375 --> 18:09.750
Carla. Wow.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.792
You look great.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.750
You're not messing with me, right?

18:13.834 --> 18:16.000
No, but I'd like to.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.125
Turk bought me this dress
out of the blue.

18:19.208 --> 18:20.625
I guess he knew I'd love it.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.959
Oh.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.542
Look, Carla.

18:24.625 --> 18:29.000
Back when I was an intern,
I remember the pressure being so insane

18:29.083 --> 18:32.041
that the only way I could get by
was to race home.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.291
And even though my wife
was already asleep,

18:34.375 --> 18:37.875
I'd gently wake her,
look her in the eyes,

18:37.959 --> 18:40.291
and then I'd passive-aggressively
torture her

18:40.375 --> 18:43.667
until she packed her bag and went to her
mom's place for the week.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.291
Oh.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.250
Does that... help?

18:47.333 --> 18:49.375
Like a big hug with words.

18:49.458 --> 18:53.083
Hey. The point is that just 'cause a guy
has problems expressing himself,

18:53.166 --> 18:57.125
that doesn't mean he doesn't need...
you.

18:58.750 --> 19:03.667
Oh, boy. Women so don't get me,
it's not even funny.

19:03.750 --> 19:07.667
It's mind-boggling, quite frankly.
The whole thing is stunning.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.125
The point is
is that it's the scrubs, right.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.375
Because in jeans, my butt is a force
to be reckoned with.

19:13.458 --> 19:17.291
-Hey, we were just looking for you.
-(J.D.) Nick, touch my butt, please.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.333
Hey, you all right?

19:22.875 --> 19:25.333
That kid is eventually gonna die.

19:25.417 --> 19:30.709
Whether it's today, tomorrow...
Or a month from now.

19:31.917 --> 19:34.500
There's nothing I can do.
Nothing works.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.291
Now his parents want to talk to me.
What am I supposed to tell them?

19:37.375 --> 19:41.375
"Peter lived a good, long seven years"?
Seven years, man.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.333
It's not fair.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.041
-I hate this place. I hate this job.
-Nick, it's not your fault.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.917
I can't do it anymore.
I... I'm done.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.917
I'm done. I'm done.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.709
(J.D.) <i>The scariest thing</i>
<i>was that I had thought</i>

19:56.792 --> 19:59.041
<i>that he was stronger than all of us.</i>

19:59.125 --> 20:00.959
<i>But maybe it's not about</i>

20:01.041 --> 20:05.291
<i>Maybe it's about finding the little things</i>

20:05.375 --> 20:08.125
<i>Whether it's the support</i>

20:11.000 --> 20:14.083
<i>Or letting yourself</i>

20:16.083 --> 20:18.333
<i>If only for a moment...</i>

20:21.417 --> 20:24.458
<i>Or being selfless every once in a while.</i>

20:31.166 --> 20:36.625
<i>I don't know. I guess</i>
<i>in the end it's about surviving...</i>

20:36.709 --> 20:38.333
<i>Any way you can.</i>

20:42.959 --> 20:44.417
See you tomorrow.

20:46.333 --> 20:50.333
-Aah! Mmm-mmm.
-You're stupid.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.333
-That's it?
-Give it time.

20:54.417 --> 20:55.834
It'll eat at ya.

21:01.125 --> 21:04.417
-Am I stupid?
-Yeah. A little bit.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.625
(J.D.) <i>Damn him.</i>
