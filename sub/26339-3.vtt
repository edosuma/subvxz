07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
We don't talk about her.

07:50.644 --> 07:51.862
You mean never?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.516
That's one of my biggest
triumphs as a parent.

07:53.647 --> 07:56.171
That and getting them to think
that it's their job

07:56.301 --> 07:57.564
to make my bed.
Yeah.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.480
On holidays, they -- they put
a little seasonal candy

08:03.091 --> 08:05.528
Douglas, Emma and Amy
deserve a safe space

08:05.659 --> 08:08.444
where they can express their
feelings and ask questions.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.228
They're little girls
whose mom died.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.622
Really, Poppy?
Okay, thanks for the update.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.406
You know what --
I think I need a safe space

08:14.537 --> 08:16.626
where I can parent my kids
the way I think fit

08:16.757 --> 08:18.889
without being lectured
by a woman whose son

08:19.020 --> 08:22.153

So you're just
running away?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.724

done in the first place --

08:27.855 --> 08:30.640

08:30.771 --> 08:32.033
All right, girls,

08:32.163 --> 08:35.732
We're gonna go to the pet store
and buy you a new pig thing.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.434
Okay, look alive, ladies. We're
gonna get a new guinea pig.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.742
Let's not stay too long, girls.
We're gonna smell like pets.

That's what you want?

They're doing better
than your kid.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.361

I killed your sister!

08:57.667 --> 08:59.887
Fine. Keep doing
what you're doing.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.628
Repress, replace,
move on.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.368
That's how you want your kids
to handle the loss of their pet.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.632
Yep.
And the loss
of their mom.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.243
You got it.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.419
Is that how
you dealt with it?

09:15.772 --> 09:18.819
I'm starting to think
you didn't deal with it at all.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.735
It's easier this way.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.782
-Dad, we got one!
-We're gonna call her "Pickle"!

09:25.913 --> 09:28.785
-B-But this isn't Pickle.
-Who cares?

09:28.916 --> 09:31.440
It'll be like
the other Pickle never existed.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.704
Yeah, Dad, like you said,
"Repress, replace, move on."

09:34.835 --> 09:37.402

N-N-No, I'm not.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.284
Okay? I'm -- I'm upset,
actually.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.894
And why are you upset?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.636
I'm upset because...

09:53.767 --> 09:57.727
this guinea pig
is a total loser.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.730
It's like God was trying
to make a possum and gave up.

We have to find
a better one.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.646

No, you're not gonna go
on break, Raj.

Not until we find a perfect

I don't care
if we have to stay all night.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.089
We only have
seven to choose from.

the second one about?

She got a colonoscopy today

You know, she died,
and I had 10-month-old twins.

They were teething.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.964
It was scarier

I didn't have time
to grieve.

I-I was doing
the best I could.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.319
They were so little.

was amazing.

to feel something.
