Well, what can I do,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.901
you know Vicky's a reporter

07:22.943 --> 07:25.153
and the news doesn't stop

07:22.943 --> 07:25.153
for holidays.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.529
Uh, I feel bad for her too.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.865
You know, she's covering

07:26.571 --> 07:28.865
elections in Sweden.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.578
So, that's it?

07:30.117 --> 07:33.578
No, more presents?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.662
Didn't

07:33.620 --> 07:34.662
a certain uncle

07:34.704 --> 07:36.415
promise us

07:34.704 --> 07:36.415
a perfect gift?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.333
- Hmm?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.459
Yes, he did.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.420
- Yay!

07:41.461 --> 07:42.545
But it's not here.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.881
- Oh.

07:44.923 --> 07:45.799
'Cause it's too big.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.343
- Hooray!

07:48.385 --> 07:51.888
If it's a elephant,

07:48.385 --> 07:51.888
I'll call him Phil.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.515
Sweetheart,

07:53.223 --> 07:54.515
if it's an elephant

07:54.557 --> 07:57.311
it'll sleep

07:54.557 --> 07:57.311
in Joey's room.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.230
Look, Uncle Jesse has something

07:57.352 --> 08:00.230
really special planned for ya

08:00.272 --> 08:02.023
to give you the real meaning

08:00.272 --> 08:02.023
of Christmas.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.985
Alright! We're going

08:02.065 --> 08:04.985
to Toys"R"Us!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.612
Wrong "R" you.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.073
We won't miss

08:07.654 --> 08:10.073
the Christmas party, will we?

08:10.115 --> 08:13.076
Oh, you'll be home in plenty

08:10.115 --> 08:13.076
of time to see me play Santa.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.412
Look, I'm gonna try

08:13.118 --> 08:15.412
a new "ho ho ho" this year.

08:15.454 --> 08:18.248
How about Jerry Lewis?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.459
<i>Ho ho ho, lady!</i>

08:18.290 --> 08:20.459
<i>Flaymin'!</i>

08:21.001 --> 08:23.086
[laughing]

08:26.798 --> 08:28.300
Okay.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.678
- Hey, guys.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.678
- 'Hi.'

08:31.719 --> 08:33.347
- Merry Christmas.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.056
- Hey.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.056
- Hi.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.433
Hey, fruitcake.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.727
- It's Joey to you.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.727
- Thanks.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.688
Deej, I couldn't wait

08:39.769 --> 08:41.688
to give you your present.

08:41.729 --> 08:42.772
Open mine, first.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.274
Okay. Thanks.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.904
Wow! This is that leather jacket

08:45.775 --> 08:49.904
I saw at the mall.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.614
God, this is so expensive,

08:49.946 --> 08:51.614
you know

08:51.656 --> 08:53.783
Deej, I didn't spend all

08:51.656 --> 08:53.783
that much on your present.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.576
I thought

08:53.825 --> 08:55.576
we had an agreement.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.496
Oh, it doesn't matter

08:55.618 --> 08:57.496
how much you spent.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.874
I love you, and I wanted to get

08:57.537 --> 09:00.874
you something you'd love.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.920
I don't expect anything

09:00.915 --> 09:05.920
special in return.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.715
It's just a Daytona Beach

09:05.962 --> 09:08.715
University sweatshirt.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.842
I hope you like it.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.556
Maybe I should've sprung

09:14.262 --> 09:16.556
for the sweatpants too.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.394
Deej?

09:21.644 --> 09:22.645
(Steve)

09:21.644 --> 09:22.645
'Deej?'

09:22.687 --> 09:24.689
[knocking on door]

09:24.731 --> 09:26.024
Steve, how could you?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.443
D.J., I'm really sorry,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.443
it's all I could afford.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.945
- I'm savin' up for college.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.945
- I know.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.240
Daytona Beach University.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.657
Don't you get it?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.617
It's not about the gift.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.412
What's gonna happen to us?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.621
You're going to school

09:38.453 --> 09:40.621
3,000 miles away.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.665
Well, don't worry,

09:40.663 --> 09:42.665
I worked it all out.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.167
We'll call each other

09:42.707 --> 09:44.167
every night

09:44.209 --> 09:46.127
and I'll see you

09:44.209 --> 09:46.127
on school holidays.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.256
Oh, great. So we'll be together

09:46.169 --> 09:49.256
on Thanksgiving, Christmas

09:49.297 --> 09:51.883
and Spuds MacKenzie's birthday.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.303
Deej, we gonna make this work.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.303
This my shot to go to college.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.097
But, you're selling

09:55.345 --> 09:57.097
yourself short.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.723
It's just a party school.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.101
Oh, well, that's easy for you

09:58.765 --> 10:01.101
to say, you're a brain.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.728
I mean, sometimes

10:01.142 --> 10:03.728
you even read for fun.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.148
I'm lucky

10:05.646 --> 10:07.148
I got in anyplace.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.193
Well, congratulations.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.193
Beach blanket U.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.861
Yeah, thanks for your support.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.861
I..

10:11.903 --> 10:13.113
...I thought you'd be

10:11.903 --> 10:13.113
happy for me.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.073
Well, why should I be

10:13.154 --> 10:15.073
happy for you?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.950
You don't even

10:15.115 --> 10:16.950
care about us.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.785
Hey, I do, too,

10:16.991 --> 10:18.785
care about us.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.995
Oh, yeah, I can tell

10:18.826 --> 10:20.995
by your Christmas gift.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.706
Who asked you to blow your whole

10:21.037 --> 10:23.706
bank account on my present?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.833
What were you trying to do,

10:23.748 --> 10:25.833
bribe me to stay?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.505
I can't believe you

10:29.170 --> 10:30.505
just said that.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.091
Hey, if the jacket fits,

10:30.547 --> 10:33.091
wear it.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.261
Oh, you know what, I'm glad

10:33.133 --> 10:36.261
you're going to Florida.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.555
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.555
- Good.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.892
Merry Christmas.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.994
Look at this!

Snow!

11:07.041 --> 11:08.418
I know.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.711
Look, it's Santa

11:08.460 --> 11:10.711
all covered in snow.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.589
And you see the little snowman?

11:12.631 --> 11:14.799
Oh, and look, look, look!

11:14.841 --> 11:17.177
Look at the snow

falling down

11:17.218 --> 11:19.304

11:20.639 --> 11:22.807
Christmas is white.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.188
Uh, boys, say, "thank you"

11:24.392 --> 11:28.188
to D.J. for the nice gift.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.064
Thank you,

11:28.229 --> 11:30.064
Dee-jeh.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.525
You're welcome.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.902
How about

11:32.567 --> 11:34.902
a Tasmanian Devil Santa?

Donner, Blitzen!

11:43.119 --> 11:44.745
Well, what do you think?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.499
Boy, if Vicky were here,

11:44.787 --> 11:47.499
she sure would love my eggnog.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.293
Well, thanks

11:48.458 --> 11:50.293
for the input.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.504
[doorbell ringing]

11:50.335 --> 11:52.504
I'm gonna go change.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.425
Deej! Sorry about

11:54.339 --> 11:57.425
you and Steve breakin' up.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.843
Hang in there.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.346
I heard the first three hours

11:58.885 --> 12:01.346
are the toughest.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.848
Well, I'm trying not to think

12:01.388 --> 12:03.848
about him but he keeps calling.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.601
Six times I wouldn't talk to

12:03.890 --> 12:06.601
him, four times I hung up.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.270
That way, I mix it up

12:06.643 --> 12:09.270
a little.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.980
It's time to get on

12:09.312 --> 12:10.980
with your life.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.066
That's why I took the liberty

12:11.022 --> 12:13.066
of bringing a little something

12:13.107 --> 12:14.401
to help brighten your holiday.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.027
The wrestling team!

12:16.069 --> 12:17.654
Come on in, boys.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.905

12:29.916 --> 12:31.543
are you doing?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.128
I'm getting you back

12:31.585 --> 12:34.128

12:34.170 --> 12:36.005
Boys, you know D.J.

12:36.047 --> 12:39.092
She broke up with Steve and she

12:36.047 --> 12:39.092
is not even thinking about him.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.262
Yeah, it's true.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.262
Steve and I broke up.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.347
And as far as

12:42.303 --> 12:44.347
thinking about him..

12:44.389 --> 12:45.848
...nothing could be

12:44.389 --> 12:45.848
further from my mind

How'd your surprise

13:10.164 --> 13:11.874
Christmas trip go?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.294
Well, they were

13:11.916 --> 13:14.294
definitely surprised.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.755
Uncle Jesse took us to

13:14.335 --> 13:16.755
a shelter for homeless people.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.339
I know,

13:16.795 --> 13:18.339
what'd you think?

13:18.381 --> 13:20.925
Dad, there were so many

13:18.381 --> 13:20.925
people there.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.802
Not just grownups.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.802
Kids too.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.432
When I saw them,

13:23.844 --> 13:27.432
it made me feel sad.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.725
It's okay to feel sad, Michelle.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.851
Those people are

13:28.767 --> 13:30.851
in a lot of trouble.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.187
It was hard at first

13:33.229 --> 13:34.355
but then we put up decorations

13:34.397 --> 13:35.940
and helped serve

13:34.397 --> 13:35.940
Christmas dinner.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.276
You guys were really great.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.276
You really pitched in.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.445
I'm a very proud

13:38.318 --> 13:40.445
uncle today.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.156
I put out the napkins.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.450
And everyone

13:43.197 --> 13:45.450
sang Christmas carols.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.702
Uncle Jesse was a big hit

13:45.492 --> 13:47.702
playing the piano.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.203
Uh, yeah, 'cause I snuck in

13:49.245 --> 13:52.831

13:49.245 --> 13:52.831

13:52.873 --> 13:54.793
their Christmas better.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.342
up with an idea like that

14:02.383 --> 14:03.677
you just make me so proud.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.261
Come here.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.556
You know what, Steph,

14:07.096 --> 14:08.556
you're right.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.433
This isn't just

14:08.598 --> 14:10.433
a Christmas thing.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.185
This should happen

14:10.475 --> 14:12.185
all year round.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.894
If more people in the world

14:12.226 --> 14:13.894
would helped out

14:13.936 --> 14:17.524
like you guys just did, it could

14:13.936 --> 14:17.524
really make a difference.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.151
I'm sorry we went

14:17.565 --> 14:20.151
so present-crazy.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.779
Uh, it's okay, I remember

14:20.193 --> 14:22.779
when I was your age

14:22.821 --> 14:25.615
I bugged my dad for

14:22.821 --> 14:25.615
an Evel Knievel jumpsuit.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.035
Why?

14:29.076 --> 14:32.330
Because I already

14:29.076 --> 14:32.330
had the helmet.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.499
Anyway, he took me down

14:32.372 --> 14:34.499
to the Salvation Army.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.125
I'll tell you something,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.125
it made me feel so good

14:36.167 --> 14:37.335
to see you guys faces today

14:37.377 --> 14:39.838
because that's exactly

14:37.377 --> 14:39.838
how I felt.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.922
And I never forgot

14:39.879 --> 14:41.922
that feeling.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.759
And I never want you guys

14:41.964 --> 14:44.759
to forget that feeling, okay?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.387
Merry Christmas, girls.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.640
Thanks for our

14:47.428 --> 14:50.640
Christmas present, Uncle Jesse.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.564
Alright, now,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.564
if you guys excuse me

14:57.605 --> 15:00.233
I have one more

14:57.605 --> 15:00.233
very important present

15:00.274 --> 15:02.610
to take care of.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.320
Now, if we go into

15:02.652 --> 15:04.320
the living room, there

15:04.362 --> 15:05.739
I think there might still be

15:04.362 --> 15:05.739
a couple of cookies

15:05.780 --> 15:06.989
with your names on 'em.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.075
Good thing I'm learning to read!

15:10.451 --> 15:12.245
And then

15:10.451 --> 15:12.245
Steve said..

15:12.286 --> 15:14.873
Well, I can't say it

15:12.286 --> 15:14.873
like he says it

15:14.914 --> 15:16.207
but..

15:17.333 --> 15:19.419
Where was I?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.419
Oh, right. Steve.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.795
You know, it's amazing.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.547
When you break up

15:20.837 --> 15:22.547
with someone like Steve

15:22.589 --> 15:24.758
you'd think you'd be obsessed

15:22.589 --> 15:24.758
with talking about Steve.

15:24.799 --> 15:28.678
But, it's really not like that,

15:24.799 --> 15:28.678
I mean, Steve who?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.767
- How am I doing?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.767
- Save your voice.

15:33.808 --> 15:37.520
Just tattoo "I miss Steve"

15:33.808 --> 15:37.520
on your forehead.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.647
Now, let me show you

15:37.562 --> 15:39.647
how to land a stud.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.651
My mom uses this mistletoe

15:43.693 --> 15:45.695
to chase Tom Jones

15:43.693 --> 15:45.695
through Caesar's Palace.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.574
Okay, boys,

15:46.863 --> 15:49.574
gather around!

15:49.616 --> 15:51.409
Two lips,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.409
no waiting.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.538
Oh, come on.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.538
Don't be shy.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.670
Miles, you animal!

16:02.712 --> 16:04.171
Ew, gross!

16:06.340 --> 16:09.051
Here, Deej, maybe

16:06.340 --> 16:09.051
you'll have better luck.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.644
I'm not ready for this.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.818
Sweetheart?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.110
You okay?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.696
Terrific. I'm having

16:26.152 --> 16:28.696
a great Christmas.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.031
Really, 'cause that's

16:28.738 --> 16:31.031
the same look Joey had

16:31.073 --> 16:33.242
when they canceled

16:31.073 --> 16:33.242
"Magilla Gorilla."

16:35.286 --> 16:37.664
How could Steve go to

16:35.286 --> 16:37.664
college in Florida?

16:37.705 --> 16:39.248
We never even

16:37.705 --> 16:39.248
talked about it.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.875
Oh, Deej, you remember

16:39.290 --> 16:40.875
how concerned you were

16:40.917 --> 16:42.251
when Steve couldn't even

16:40.917 --> 16:42.251
get into college.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.545
This could be

16:42.293 --> 16:44.545
a great opportunity for him.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.340
I know, but he's going

16:44.587 --> 16:47.340
so far away.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.758
What's gonna happen to us?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.051
Hey, long distance

16:48.800 --> 16:51.051
relationships are not easy

16:51.093 --> 16:52.846
but Vicky and I

16:51.093 --> 16:52.846
are making it work.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.555
If you and Steve really care

16:52.887 --> 16:54.555
about each other

16:54.597 --> 16:56.891
you'll make it work too.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.184
That's what Steve said.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.269
Look, the phone bill's

16:58.225 --> 17:00.269
gonna be a monster

17:00.311 --> 17:01.562
but it'll balance out

17:01.604 --> 17:03.397
with what we save

17:01.604 --> 17:03.397
on food for Steve.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.026
Dad, he hurt me so much.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.821
He said I gave him that jacket

17:07.067 --> 17:09.821
to buy his love.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.739
Well, did you spend

17:09.863 --> 17:11.739
all your money on it

17:11.781 --> 17:14.408
because you thought it might

17:11.781 --> 17:14.408
show how much you care about him

17:14.450 --> 17:16.035
so he'd decide not to leave?

17:16.076 --> 17:19.413
Of course not. I bought it

17:16.076 --> 17:19.413
to show how much I love him

17:19.455 --> 17:21.624
so he'd decide

17:19.455 --> 17:21.624
not to leave.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.086
Maybe it's close

17:22.750 --> 17:26.086
to what you said.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.340
Okay, maybe, it's exactly

17:26.128 --> 17:29.340
what you said.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.258
I really messed up.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.386
Do you think he'll ever

17:31.300 --> 17:33.386
talk to me again?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.765
Well, honey,

17:34.929 --> 17:37.765
you know, uh

17:37.807 --> 17:39.308
only one way

17:37.807 --> 17:39.308
to find out.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.606
Santa is here!

17:45.648 --> 17:48.192
Not the real Santa,

17:45.648 --> 17:48.192
just Joey.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.319
But don't tell anyone!

17:53.113 --> 17:55.241
It's his answering machine.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.368
Why didn't I talk to him

17:55.282 --> 17:57.368
when I had the chance?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.536
Maybe you didn't hear me

17:58.578 --> 18:00.621
it's the big jolly guy!

18:01.831 --> 18:03.624
Come on, sweetie.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.919
Ho ho ho!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.127
Ho ho ho!

18:07.169 --> 18:09.255
Ha ha ho.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.299
See? I told you.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.677
Ho ho ho!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.971
Not your best "ho ho ho," Joey.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.014
[doorbell ringing]

18:18.056 --> 18:19.057
I'll get it!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.017
I'm with you.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.646
Ho ho ho!

18:25.688 --> 18:28.357
Wow! Two Santa's!

18:28.399 --> 18:30.526
Told you

18:28.399 --> 18:30.526
I was good this year.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.946
I'll get this,

18:31.611 --> 18:32.946
honey.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.280
Hi.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.280
I'm Danny Tanner.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.823
Don't tell me

18:34.321 --> 18:35.823
your sled broke down.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.076
You really ought to rotate

18:35.865 --> 18:38.076
those reindeer.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.956
Whoa, look, I know the north

18:40.661 --> 18:42.956
pole is lonely, buddy, but--

18:42.997 --> 18:45.041
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.334
Vicky!

18:47.376 --> 18:48.669
Vicky!

18:48.711 --> 18:50.922
Oh, that lip gloss

18:48.711 --> 18:50.922
should've tipped me off.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.172
[laughing]

18:52.214 --> 18:53.758
Hey, look, everybody.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.758
Vicky's here!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.009
(all)

18:53.800 --> 18:55.009
Hi, Vicky.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.636
[sighing]

18:56.677 --> 18:58.554
Oh, what are you doing here?

18:56.677 --> 18:58.554
You're supposed to be in Sweden.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.933
I was, way up at the Arctic

18:58.596 --> 19:01.933
Circle but as soon as I finished

19:01.975 --> 19:04.727
I took a dog sled 40 miles

19:01.975 --> 19:04.727
to the nearest train station

19:04.769 --> 19:08.230
rode overnight to the airport,

19:04.769 --> 19:08.230
rented a Santa Claus suit

19:08.272 --> 19:09.899
jumped on the last flight

19:08.272 --> 19:09.899
to San Francisco

19:09.941 --> 19:11.609
and arrived 20 minutes ago.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.235
Wow! 20 minutes

19:11.651 --> 19:13.235
from the airport.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.071
You made great time.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.614
Come here.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.077
You know, Joey, I wish you

19:18.282 --> 19:21.077
really were Santa Claus

19:21.119 --> 19:22.411
then I'd ask you

19:21.119 --> 19:22.411
to bring me Steve

19:22.453 --> 19:24.122
so I could apologize to him.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.539
I was so selfish.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.084
I should be happy

19:25.581 --> 19:28.084
he got into college.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.128
Ho ho ho!

19:30.169 --> 19:32.379
Or as Daffy Duck would say

19:32.421 --> 19:33.798
[mimicking Daffy Duck]

19:32.421 --> 19:33.798
Ho ho ho!

19:33.840 --> 19:37.802
All you wonderful

19:33.840 --> 19:37.802
t-t-than franthiscans!

19:39.012 --> 19:40.805
- Santa.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.890
Yeah, Santa.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.853
This Santa thing

19:42.932 --> 19:46.853
is outta control.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.063
[mimicking Daffy Duck]

19:46.894 --> 19:49.063
Well, well, well

19:49.105 --> 19:53.192
it seems as though there's

19:49.105 --> 19:53.192
an impos-s-ster amongst us.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.236
Wait.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.236
If that's Joey

19:56.278 --> 19:58.364
then who are you?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.951
Steve!

20:01.993 --> 20:04.078
[mimicking Daffy Duck]

20:01.993 --> 20:04.078
S-s-s-some S-S-Santa Claus!

20:06.039 --> 20:08.041
Deej, I'm sorry, but

20:06.039 --> 20:08.041
this is the only way

20:08.082 --> 20:09.375
I could get you to talk to me.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.044
Why didn't you

20:09.416 --> 20:11.044
tell me it was you?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.172
Well, Santa never interrupts

20:11.085 --> 20:14.172
an apology.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.673
Well, I'm really sorry.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.050
Yeah, me too.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.592
I got so pumped up about

20:17.091 --> 20:18.592
getting into the college

20:18.634 --> 20:20.636
that I didn't even think

20:18.634 --> 20:20.636
about your feelings.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.221
No, you were right.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.724
We'll make this work no matter

20:22.262 --> 20:24.724
how far apart we are.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.101
Well, we're not gonna

20:24.765 --> 20:27.101
be far apart.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.435
I'm gonna stay in town

20:27.143 --> 20:28.435
and go to

20:28.477 --> 20:30.437
junior college

20:28.477 --> 20:30.437
and improve my grades.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.940
Then maybe I can

20:30.479 --> 20:32.940
get into a really good school.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.317
Oh, Steve,

20:32.982 --> 20:35.317
I love you.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.819
I love you too.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.907
(all)

20:38.988 --> 20:40.907
Aw!

20:44.577 --> 20:46.746
Excuse me. Hey, everybody,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.746
I have an announcement.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.123
There's a very special delivery

20:46.787 --> 20:49.123
in the backyard

20:49.165 --> 20:51.834
for Mrs. Rebecca Donaldson

20:49.165 --> 20:51.834
Katsopolis.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.502
Jess, another gift?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.462
Yeah, it's just a little

20:53.544 --> 20:55.462
something that wouldn't fit

20:55.504 --> 20:57.339
in your stocking.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.634
Alright, guys.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.970
She's crossing

21:00.676 --> 21:02.970
though the kitchen..

21:03.012 --> 21:04.680
...she's opening
