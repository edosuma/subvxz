WEBVTT

02:16.971 --> 02:20.058
What'd you think,
you paired up with him?

02:21.726 --> 02:22.811
What I think?

02:25.855 --> 02:30.026
Well, you don't pick your parents,
and you don't pick your partner.

02:31.402 --> 02:35.198
You know, they used to call him
"The Tax Man" for a while?

02:36.950 --> 02:39.869
He come out of Texas, so nobody knew him.

02:40.578 --> 02:45.083
Seemed a bit raw-boned to me. Edgy.

02:46.417 --> 02:50.255
Took three months
till we got him over to the house for dinner.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.674
Around our big 419.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.176
That's what y'all want to hear about, right?

02:55.260 --> 02:57.971
Dora Lange. The kids in the woods.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.347
Yeah, sure.

02:59.430 --> 03:03.142
But talk about Cohle.
We heard some stories.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.311
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

03:06.729 --> 03:08.773
"Strange."

03:10.650 --> 03:11.776
Yeah.

03:13.069 --> 03:18.366
<i>Rust would pick a fight with the sky,
he didn't like its shade of blue.</i>

03:21.202 --> 03:24.163
<i>But when we finally
got him over to the house,</i>

03:24.247 --> 03:26.332
<i>this is when that case was hot,</i>

03:26.416 --> 03:30.336
<i>poor bastard looked like
he was on his way to the firing squad.</i>

03:31.713 --> 03:33.631
<i>Dora Lange.</i>

03:34.048 --> 03:37.010
The "Occult Ritual Murder."

03:38.261 --> 03:40.680
You can thank <i>The Advertiser</i> for that.

03:41.306 --> 03:42.765
Could you hold off on that?

03:42.849 --> 03:44.225
Yeah, you can't
do that here no more.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.024
Don't be assholes.
You want to hear this or not?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.964
Vermilion Sheriff requested assistance
with a 419, cane fields outside of Erath.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.760
I'd been on the job
about three months till then.

04:18.843 --> 04:21.471
Two previous cases were open and shut.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.686
On January the 3rd, 1995,
my daughter's birthday,

04:30.021 --> 04:31.397
I remember.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.383
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.427
Who found her?

05:01.511 --> 05:03.096
A farmer and his son.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.348
This spread wasn't scheduled for a burn.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.601
Let's keep them here,
and let's tape off this road,

05:08.685 --> 05:10.770
and give me your log.

05:34.419 --> 05:35.837
Go ahead.

05:59.444 --> 06:01.612
- You ever see something like this?
- No, Sheriff.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.532
Eight years, CID.

06:05.575 --> 06:08.411
Them symbols, it's Satanic.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.831
They had a <i>20/20</i> on it a few years back.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.126
- ID?
- No, sir.

06:17.253 --> 06:20.423
We're gonna need
more men for a grid search.

06:21.674 --> 06:25.136
Set up a perimeter wide as possible
on those three roads.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.598
Post up, take license plates
of anything that passes.

06:29.974 --> 06:30.975
I-23.

06:31.059 --> 06:33.019
<i>Go ahead, I-23.</i>

06:33.811 --> 06:38.066
We're gonna need
investigator assist on that 419,

06:38.149 --> 06:39.859
all you can spare for a canvass.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.319
<i>Roger that, Detective.</i>

06:42.278 --> 06:45.031
Okay. Tell me what you see.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.495
Ligature marks on her wrists,
ankles and knees.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.916
Multiple shallow stab wounds
to the abdomen.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.834
Hemorrhaging around throat.

06:56.918 --> 07:00.004
Lividity at the shoulders, thighs, and torso.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.008
She'd been on her back awhile

07:05.426 --> 07:07.303
before he moved her.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.772
<i>That's why they called him
"The Tax Man."</i>

07:17.855 --> 07:21.192
<i>The rest of us had
these little note pads or something.</i>

07:21.275 --> 07:23.778
<i>He had this big ledger.</i>

07:23.861 --> 07:28.032
<i>Looked funny walking door to door with it
like the tax man,</i>

07:28.741 --> 07:31.661
<i>which ain't bad, as far as nicknames go.</i>

07:33.329 --> 07:36.541
<i>Yeah. Of course,
I've always taken a lot of notes.</i>

07:36.999 --> 07:40.670
I mean, you never know
what the thing's gonna be, do you?

07:40.753 --> 07:45.133
That little detail, somewhere
way down the line, makes you say, "Oh!"

07:46.384 --> 07:48.010
Breaks the case.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.264
You know, I've seen all the different types.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.724
We all fit a certain category.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.435
The bully.

07:57.395 --> 07:58.813
The charmer.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.191
The surrogate dad.

08:02.275 --> 08:06.195
The man possessed by ungovernable rage.

08:06.279 --> 08:08.030
The brain.

08:08.114 --> 08:13.786
And any of those types
could be a good detective,

08:13.870 --> 08:17.415
and any of those types could be
an incompetent shit-heel.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.459
Which type were you?

08:21.460 --> 08:23.087
I was just

08:24.255 --> 08:26.299
a regular-type dude

08:26.382 --> 08:28.176
with a big-ass dick.

08:31.304 --> 08:34.265
A lot of it had to do
with how they manage authority.

08:36.559 --> 08:41.480
<i>There can be a burden
in authority, in vigilance.</i>

08:42.440 --> 08:45.610
<i>Like a father's burden.</i>

08:46.319 --> 08:48.571
<i>It's too much for some men.</i>

08:49.113 --> 08:52.033
<i>A smart guy who's steady is hard to find.</i>

08:53.159 --> 08:55.870
<i>I was all right. Better than some.</i>

08:55.953 --> 09:00.875
<i>But I knew how to talk to people,
and I was steady.</i>

09:03.044 --> 09:04.545
<i>Rust,</i>

09:04.629 --> 09:09.217
<i>now his Texas files were classified,
or redacted.</i>

09:09.300 --> 09:14.222
<i>And he wasn't big on talking
except when you wanted him to shut up.</i>

09:15.806 --> 09:17.475
<i>But he was smart.</i>

09:22.438 --> 09:27.026
Yeah. Second week we were together,
I saw where he was living.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.613
Kind of made me feel for the guy.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.170
I'd offer you a seat, but...

09:47.922 --> 09:50.841
Don't mention it. I... I can't stay.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.140
<i>Yeah, I'll tell you guys, and believe me,</i>

09:58.224 --> 10:03.145
past a certain age,
a man without a family can be a bad thing.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.802
<i>We'd encountered a meta-psychotic.</i>

10:37.930 --> 10:42.184
Which I had to explain to Marty
what meta-psychotic was.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.192
This is gonna happen again.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.236
Or it's happened before.

10:53.446 --> 10:54.613
Both.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.408
Go on.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.580
It's fantasy enactment. Ritual.

11:03.581 --> 11:05.916
Fetishization, iconography.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.629
This is his vision.
Her body is a paraphilic love map.

11:12.423 --> 11:14.008
How's that?

11:14.091 --> 11:19.263
An attachment of physical lust to fantasies
and practices forbidden by society.

11:22.350 --> 11:24.852
You get that from one of your books?

11:24.935 --> 11:26.270
I did.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.942
Her knees are abraded, rug burns on her back.

11:32.485 --> 11:35.029
Cold sores, gum line recession, bad teeth.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.782
There's decent odds she was a prost.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.825
He might not have known her,

11:41.911 --> 11:44.580
but this idea goes way back with him.

11:47.708 --> 11:52.380
You got a chapter in one of those books
on jumping to conclusions?

11:53.714 --> 11:56.509
You attach an assumption
to a piece of evidence,

11:56.592 --> 12:00.304
you start to bend the narrative to support it.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.973
Prejudice yourself.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.646
Wait and see on the ID.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.359
All right.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.487
This kind of thing
does not happen in a vacuum.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.283
I guarantee this wasn't his first.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.994
It's too specific.

12:37.383 --> 12:40.219
Listen... this is

12:42.346 --> 12:46.308
a stupid time to mention this,

12:48.644 --> 12:50.855
but you got to come to dinner.

12:51.564 --> 12:55.609
Can't put Maggie off anymore,
so you just got to.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.660
All right.

13:11.876 --> 13:14.378
- Gordon, thanks for coming.
- Marty.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.925
<i>Anyway, that evening,
it wasn't even sundown,</i>

13:20.009 --> 13:23.471
<i>he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,</i>

13:23.554 --> 13:25.473
<i>which I got a problem with.</i>

13:25.556 --> 13:28.517
<i>All right, 'cause I'm thinking
about Marty's wife and his two kids</i>

13:28.601 --> 13:31.604
<i>and how it's my daughter's birthday,</i>

13:31.687 --> 13:33.147
<i>and I know...</i>

13:35.816 --> 13:37.735
There's nothing I can do about it.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.571
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

13:42.490 --> 13:44.408
but I'm gonna have a drink.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.995
- Let me get up!
- Daddy!

13:48.704 --> 13:51.749
You're gonna meet him.
I got to get the door.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.086
Hey.

14:12.978 --> 14:18.484
<i>People out here, it's like they don't
even know the outside world exists.</i>

14:20.778 --> 14:23.697
Might as well be living on the fucking moon.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.035
There's all kinds of ghettos in the world.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.497
It's all one ghetto, man.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.333
A giant gutter in outer space.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.632
Today, that scene,

14:43.217 --> 14:46.637
that is the most fucked up thing I ever caught.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.016
Ask you something?

14:51.475 --> 14:53.477
You're a Christian, yeah?

14:55.354 --> 14:56.438
No.

14:57.982 --> 15:01.652
Well, then what do you got the cross for
in your apartment?

15:02.486 --> 15:04.655
That's a form of meditation.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.199
How's that?

15:10.995 --> 15:13.706
I contemplate the moment in the garden,

15:14.957 --> 15:18.836
the idea of allowing your own crucifixion.

15:24.216 --> 15:27.052
But you're not a Christian.
So what do you believe?

15:28.095 --> 15:30.639
I believe that people shouldn't talk
about this type of shit at work.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.349
Hold on, hold on.

15:34.727 --> 15:38.272
Three months we been together,
I get nothing from you.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.692
Today, what we're into now.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.779
Do me a courtesy, okay?
I'm not trying to convert you.

15:45.863 --> 15:48.032
Look, I'd consider myself a realist, all right,

15:48.115 --> 15:51.785
but in philosophical terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.413
Okay. What's that mean?

15:54.496 --> 15:56.582
It means I'm bad at parties.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.879
Let me tell you,
you ain't great outside of parties either.

16:08.719 --> 16:13.098
I think human consciousness
is a tragic misstep in evolution.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.684
We became too self-aware.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.772
Nature created an aspect of nature
separate from itself.

16:19.855 --> 16:23.442
We are creatures that should not exist
by natural law.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.945
That sounds god-fucking-awful, Rust.

16:27.029 --> 16:31.492
We are things that labor under the illusion
of having a self,

16:31.575 --> 16:35.579
this accretion of sensory experience
and feeling,

16:36.538 --> 16:40.793
programmed with total assurance
that we are each somebody

16:41.794 --> 16:43.879
when, in fact, everybody's nobody.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.340
I wouldn't go around
spouting that shit if I was you.

16:46.423 --> 16:50.177
People around here don't think that way.
I don't think that way.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.888
I think the honorable thing
for our species to do

16:52.971 --> 16:54.973
is deny our programming.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.726
Stop reproducing.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.397
Walk hand in hand into extinction.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.773
One last midnight.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.609
Brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.408
So what's the point
in getting out of bed in the morning?

17:12.491 --> 17:14.451
I tell myself I bear witness,

17:14.535 --> 17:18.622
but the real answer is
that it's obviously my programming.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.959
And I lack the constitution for suicide.

17:22.793 --> 17:26.630
My luck, I picked today to get to know you.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.675
Three months I don't hear a word from you,
and...

17:29.758 --> 17:30.884
- You asked.
- Yeah.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.679
And now I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.940
I get a bad taste in my mouth out here.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.985
Aluminum, ash.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.281
Like you can smell the psychosphere.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.657
I got an idea.

17:53.741 --> 17:58.579
Let's make the car
a place of silent reflection from now on.

17:59.705 --> 18:00.789
Okay?

18:10.549 --> 18:12.843
What should I bring for dinner?

18:16.847 --> 18:19.558
A bottle of wine would be nice, I guess.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.728
I don't drink.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.982
No, of course not, Rust.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.444
Listen. When you're at my house,
I want you to chill the fuck out.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.447
Don't even mention any of that bullshit
you just said to me.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.948
Of course not, Marty.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.534
I'm not some kind of maniac, all right?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.536
I mean, for fuck's sake.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.264
- What did you hear?
- Ask Cohle.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.891
You mean The Tax Man?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.726
You know he's IA.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.355
This is State CID Homicide Detective Geraci.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.235
Yes, ma'am.
I'm calling to ask about that night...

19:13.153 --> 19:15.614
I mean, you never heard
any shit like this before.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.032
She had

19:17.783 --> 19:18.867
antlers.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.496
- Fuck.
- This is...

19:22.579 --> 19:26.917
This is a real thing. It's some <i>Halloween</i> shit.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.049
Well, we're gonna have to do
a press conference.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.594
What about him? What do you think?

19:43.141 --> 19:44.434
Smart.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.979
Aloof.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.731
Doesn't care about making friends,

19:49.815 --> 19:52.484
but he's already running with it.

19:52.568 --> 19:55.445
He's got a real mind for it.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.365
Yeah.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.492
So you'd keep him on it?

20:05.956 --> 20:08.208
Both of us, yeah, I would.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.794
All right. You're still lead.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.797
The incident room is yours.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.217
- And you do the briefing tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.635
Thank you.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.475
Hello, sir.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.024
Fuck that prick.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.734
All I'm saying is
it doesn't make any sense

20:33.817 --> 20:35.903
- for her to be dumped in a cane field.
- Hello?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.738
Apparently, she had
all kinds of weird markings.

20:37.821 --> 20:38.864
Yeah. No. I couldn't hear you there.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.866
Antlers, and shit
there was burned out.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.784
That's my point.
They wanted you to see her.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.161
Yeah. You don't mark up a body like that...

20:44.244 --> 20:46.914
She had antlers? What does that mean?

20:46.997 --> 20:48.582
It was a crown.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.754
We'll do the briefing tomorrow, guys. Early.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.506
My guy does the AP Wire
asked about Satanism.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.927
It got Speece here.
You're gonna have his nose up your ass.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.554
Major was saying something
about a press conference.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.349
Well, guess I can count my blessings, fellas.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.017
Thanks for that.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.074
Hey, you mind if I skate?

21:23.200 --> 21:26.578
I got some names from Vice, prost farms.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.081
Check around on our DB.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.125
You want me to go with you?

21:32.209 --> 21:34.461
Nah. Just something to do.

21:36.630 --> 21:40.342
Yeah. You go ahead.
I'll take care of the paperwork.

21:44.846 --> 21:49.059
<i>Like I said, I'm feeling a lot of stuff
hit me at this time.</i>

21:49.142 --> 21:53.605
<i>My daughter's birthday, this dead woman,
and</i>

21:56.233 --> 22:01.530
<i>figured I'd work the case, you know,
till DiCillo called or we got an ID.</i>

22:04.449 --> 22:07.035
<i>State Vice gave me some addresses
to follow up on.</i>

22:07.119 --> 22:10.914
<i>So far, nobody had talked to me.</i>

22:35.689 --> 22:36.857
Come on!

22:45.949 --> 22:47.075
Evening, ladies.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.871
I was hoping to ask y'all a few questions.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.708
Come on, man.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.376
I'll get the next round.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.170
You making trouble for us, sir?

22:58.962 --> 23:02.466
No. I'm just looking to get
some information on a woman.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.717
Might be you know her.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.635
- Who's that?
- Hold on.

23:08.722 --> 23:12.100
We'll take two large
Long Island Iced Teas, please.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.896
Ma'am.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.770
I'm Rust, by the way.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.147
I'm Anette. She's Lucy.

24:01.358 --> 24:05.237
Either one of you
know a woman about your age?

24:05.320 --> 24:06.822
Works the same place.

24:07.030 --> 24:11.076
About 5'5". Blond, like you.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.537
What kind of tits she have?

24:16.706 --> 24:21.419
Medium, a little larger than yours,
proportion to the body, natural.

24:22.796 --> 24:26.424
Gee. I don't know.
We see a lot of girls like that around.

24:27.259 --> 24:30.804
Any girls like that
you haven't seen around lately?

24:30.887 --> 24:32.472
Missing, like?

24:32.556 --> 24:34.307
People come and go.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.894
What do you want them for?

24:39.604 --> 24:43.984
I wouldn't bust somebody for hooking
or drugs.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.073
I'm murder police.

24:50.157 --> 24:51.950
Somebody got killed.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.787
There's a girl named Liza,
another called Destiny,

24:55.871 --> 24:58.832
but I seen Destiny yesterday at McDonald's.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.667
- What about Liza?
- She's here.

25:12.220 --> 25:16.183
Anette, go get a couple more drinks
from the bar, will you, please?

25:18.810 --> 25:20.103
All right.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.570
You get pills pretty easy?

25:32.365 --> 25:34.451
Relax. I want some.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.079
Speed?

25:38.163 --> 25:41.708
No, Quaaludes. Anything barbital.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.920
Uppers are easier to get,
and they last longer, too.

25:45.003 --> 25:47.422
Yeah, but it's not like that.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.049
What's it like?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.593
I don't sleep.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.295
Hey.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.757
Hey, Lone Ranger.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.967
Hey.

26:34.552 --> 26:35.804
Dreaming.

26:35.887 --> 26:37.138
Why you out here, huh?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.684
Why didn't you come to bed?

26:47.065 --> 26:50.944
Caught a bad one yesterday.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.947
Just couldn't sleep.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.783
You got that woman from Erath?

26:56.866 --> 26:58.285
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

26:58.368 --> 27:00.161
Saw it on the news.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.875
Girls will be up soon.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.796
Missed you the last couple days.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.717
Oh, shit. I got to shower.

27:15.010 --> 27:19.055
Got a debriefing today
and maybe a press conference later.

27:25.562 --> 27:28.732
And if Speece calls,
tell him I'm debriefing the squad all morning.

27:28.815 --> 27:29.983
Well, Marty
said he was doing that.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.026
He is.

27:31.109 --> 27:32.610
Hey, beautiful.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.863
Morning, baby.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.573
Marty,
how you want your coffee, doll?

27:36.656 --> 27:38.783
Strong and black, just like you.

27:39.242 --> 27:42.370
Prints came back. Dora Kelly Lange.

27:42.454 --> 27:47.709
Priors for shoplifting, possession
and solicitation.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.419
Address outside of St. Martinville.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.172
Landlord says she hasn't lived there
in almost a year.

27:52.255 --> 27:53.340
She's got an ex, Charlie Lange,

27:53.423 --> 27:55.842
who's doing eight in Avoyelles
for bad checks.

27:55.925 --> 27:59.471
Mom's outside of Breaux Bridge.
DMV license expired.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.264
And DiCillo called.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.812
She was washed clean,
not a print on her.

28:07.896 --> 28:11.191
We got ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles.

28:11.274 --> 28:14.903
She was bound by a half-inch rope,
maybe 10, 20 hours.

28:14.986 --> 28:17.572
Evidence of vaginal intercourse.

28:17.906 --> 28:21.868
Bound upright.
Hadn't eaten in a day, maybe more.

28:22.243 --> 28:25.872
Toxicology hit for lysergic acid
and methamphetamine.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.208
Crystal and LSD.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.044
How much LSD?

28:31.127 --> 28:33.922
Hard to say. Got to wait for a mass spec.

28:35.215 --> 28:38.093
So she was drugged, bound,

28:39.386 --> 28:42.889
tortured with a knife, strangled,

28:44.140 --> 28:45.392
posed out there.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.602
Yeah.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.148
What about this stuff?

28:52.232 --> 28:55.068
Well, the crown,
for lack of a better word,

28:55.985 --> 29:00.073
rose thorns, early cane, switchgrass

29:00.824 --> 29:03.034
wrapped around a bent branch.

29:03.993 --> 29:07.414
And the horns are deer antlers.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.707
Again, no prints on anything.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.627
The symbols are painted
with acrylic, basic blue,

29:12.710 --> 29:14.170
using a thick glove finger.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.423
Ideas what any of this means?

29:16.506 --> 29:18.007
I don't know.

29:18.967 --> 29:22.053
And it's all primitive. It's like cave paintings.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.347
Maybe you ought to talk to an anthropologist.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.656
All the trouble this guy went to.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.533
Seems real personal.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.244
I don't think so.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.205
It was iconic, planned.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.667
And in some ways, it was impersonal.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.586
Think of the blindfold.

29:59.048 --> 30:03.636
This place is like somebody's memory
of the town, and the memory's fading.

30:04.721 --> 30:06.848
It's like there was
never anything here but jungle.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.978
Stop saying shit like that. It's unprofessional.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.731
Is that what I'm going for here?

30:15.773 --> 30:19.903
I just want you to stop saying odd shit,
like you smell a psycho's fear,

30:19.986 --> 30:22.238
or you're in someone's
faded memory of a town.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.531
Just stop.

30:23.615 --> 30:26.868
Well, given how long it's taken for me
to reconcile my nature,

30:26.951 --> 30:29.746
I can't figure I'd forgo it
on your account, Marty.

30:46.554 --> 30:49.140
You get any sleep last night?

30:49.224 --> 30:51.059
I don't sleep.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.644
I just dream.

30:54.896 --> 30:55.939
"Occult."

30:57.148 --> 30:59.776
Now, I don't know
if this shit is anything but crazy,

30:59.859 --> 31:03.196
but Speece and the Superintendent,
they're paying attention.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.156
The newspapers are making hay.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.700
Church groups.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.786
Detective?

31:11.287 --> 31:13.373
All right, here's what we got so far.

31:13.456 --> 31:16.918
Deceased's name is Dora Kelly Lange, 28.

31:17.001 --> 31:19.295
<i>You stay busy now, the business?</i>

31:19.754 --> 31:24.092
<i>Well, yeah, I got the security firm,
PI stuff. Routine.</i>

31:24.968 --> 31:29.013
<i>A lot of guys that leave their job,
cemetery within 10.</i>

31:29.556 --> 31:31.933
No family, idle hands.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.813
Some advice. You make it out, you stay busy.

31:37.647 --> 31:40.984
Hit the corners.
Ask about anybody she was seeing.

31:41.067 --> 31:45.989
Regular customers, meth dealers,
rough johns, anything.

31:47.532 --> 31:49.617
Any questions?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.770
You believe in ghosts?

32:21.357 --> 32:24.527
What'd we say about silent reflection?

32:34.871 --> 32:36.748
<i>You happen to hear anything
out of the ordinary</i>

32:36.831 --> 32:39.959
between 10:00 and 1:00 a.m. out back?

32:41.210 --> 32:45.548
No, no, but sometimes
they dove hunt out there.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.717
They found a woman?

32:49.677 --> 32:51.054
<i>Is it the Fontenot girl?</i>

32:51.721 --> 32:54.182
- Who?
- And why would you ask that?

32:54.265 --> 32:55.391
I don't know.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.144
Went missing around here years back.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.937
Last time something happened.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.398
Just thought maybe it's her.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.067
How old was she, this girl?

33:04.150 --> 33:05.610
I don't know. Little.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.989
You know where the family lives?

33:20.166 --> 33:23.211
They had a place a couple of streets down.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.881
They moved after.

33:28.257 --> 33:30.468
<i>Do you know the Fontenot girl,
the one went missing?</i>

33:30.551 --> 33:31.886
<i>Her?</i>

33:33.304 --> 33:37.558
Her family come to our service once or twice,
five or six years back.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.478
Is that the girl? Oh, Lord.

33:40.937 --> 33:42.689
No, sir, it's not.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.608
Excuse me.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.361
I want to ask y'all something.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.655
Y'all think maybe this have
something to do with those cats?

33:50.738 --> 33:53.199
- What cats?
- Two of them.

33:53.282 --> 33:55.702
One, and a couple of weeks later another.

33:55.785 --> 33:57.036
Somebody cut them up,

33:57.662 --> 34:00.707
turned the insides out,
then nailed them to the front door, twice.

34:01.124 --> 34:03.376
Now, I called and told the police,

34:03.459 --> 34:06.212
but we're predominantly
an African American congregation.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.965
I asked for it to be investigated.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.593
We aren't those type of police, sir.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.304
Well, who is, then?

34:20.143 --> 34:22.311
Can I ask you something?

34:25.898 --> 34:28.818
Any of these look familiar to you?
Seen them anywhere?

34:28.901 --> 34:30.695
No. No, they

34:30.778 --> 34:33.781
look like something that might be
carved into a tree or something.

34:33.865 --> 34:35.825
How about these?

34:36.951 --> 34:40.872
Now, that look like something my old auntie
taught us how to make when I was a tyke.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.082
What are they?

34:43.166 --> 34:45.877
Some folks call them bird traps.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.588
Old auntie told us that they were devil nets.

34:48.671 --> 34:51.716
You put them around the bed,
catch the devil before he get too close.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.885
That's interesting.

34:53.968 --> 34:56.012
She was a wonderful woman.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.182
Loved her some Jesus,

34:59.265 --> 35:02.351
but had a bit of that Santeria in her,
you know.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.688
I always just thought it was something
for children to do.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.106
Keep them busy.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.151
Tell them stories
why they're tying sticks together.

35:11.277 --> 35:14.322
Then that's all we got
on the Fontenot girl.

35:14.405 --> 35:15.698
There was nothing in there.

35:15.782 --> 35:18.201
Says, "Possible report made in error."

35:18.284 --> 35:19.619
Now, that was five years ago.

35:19.702 --> 35:21.871
Ted Childress was sheriff back then.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.373
He's set up in Gulf Shores now, I think.

35:24.457 --> 35:27.084
10-year-old girl goes missing,
that doesn't go statewide?

35:27.168 --> 35:30.713
Now, hold on now. My understanding,
the little girl went off with her birth daddy.

35:30.838 --> 35:35.051
Now, did you check her mom's record?
Possession, solicitation.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.303
I believe Ted knew the family,

35:37.386 --> 35:39.931
and the feeling was the little girl
was better off with her daddy.

35:40.014 --> 35:41.974
Mom seemed to agree.

35:42.058 --> 35:44.477
She filed a complaint,
then never bothered with it again.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.812
Took off with her boyfriend.

35:46.729 --> 35:50.691
R&I said you had a complaint these parts
around December.

35:50.775 --> 35:53.069
Little girl getting chased through the woods.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.655
Yeah, I pulled that one for you, too.

36:04.455 --> 36:05.998
What the hell is this?

36:06.082 --> 36:09.669
Little girl said a green-eared spaghetti
monster chased her through some woods.

36:11.254 --> 36:13.589
Now, we had her work with a sketch artist,

36:13.673 --> 36:15.675
and she told us that looked exactly right.

36:15.758 --> 36:19.387
Now, you want to call in an APB on that,
you go right ahead.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.183
Listen, boys. I'm gonna have to call
a little timeout, make a beer run.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.811
Well, why don't you hold off
on that for a while?

36:29.480 --> 36:31.858
All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

36:32.567 --> 36:34.694
We really don't want to do that.

36:34.777 --> 36:37.905
Well, is this supposed to be admissible?
Huh?

36:38.781 --> 36:41.284
You wanna pick my brain?

36:41.450 --> 36:45.621
You work a room, you buy a man
a cheeseburger and a Coke, don't you?

36:47.582 --> 36:51.252
I'll take a sixer.
Old Milwaukee or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.880
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

36:53.963 --> 36:56.883
'Cause it's Thursday and it's past noon.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.303
Thursday is one of my days off.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.222
On my off days, I start drinking at noon.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.601
You don't get to interrupt that.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.787
I'd appreciate a little hustle up on that.

37:29.123 --> 37:32.084
<i>Yesterday,
at approximately 6 a.m.,</i>

37:32.627 --> 37:38.549
civilians came across the body of a female
in a sugar cane field outside of Erath.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.637
Now, this person, we believe, was murdered,

37:42.720 --> 37:44.597
and we are not yet in a position to

37:44.680 --> 37:49.560
release the identity of the victim
or to offer details of the crime.

37:49.644 --> 37:52.855
Our investigators

37:53.147 --> 37:58.194
have several leads, and hopefully
will have a suspect for you in custody soon.

37:59.487 --> 38:05.201
<i>Now, this perpetrator will be apprehended,
and he will know swift Louisiana justice.</i>

38:05.284 --> 38:07.453
<i>- Any Satanic signs?
- How old was she?</i>

38:07.536 --> 38:09.163
<i>Charlie?</i>

38:09.246 --> 38:11.207
<i>Let's talk about your ex, Dora Lange.</i>

38:11.874 --> 38:13.501
You want to talk Dori?

38:14.168 --> 38:16.295
What's she said I've done now?

38:16.879 --> 38:19.966
Nothing. We're just curious
if you knew what she's been up to,

38:20.049 --> 38:21.300
maybe where she's living?

38:21.384 --> 38:22.385
Nope.

38:23.427 --> 38:27.139
Got the divorce papers pushed through
after I'd been here about a year.

38:27.223 --> 38:28.975
I don't blame the bitch.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.352
She got a habit?

38:31.435 --> 38:33.854
Yeah, a few.

38:34.397 --> 38:37.942
Weed, meth, juice. Name it.

38:38.651 --> 38:41.278
Charlie, how'd y'all meet?

38:41.362 --> 38:43.906
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.866
Hitched up way too quick.

38:47.076 --> 38:49.912
You know how it is,
you want a wife, but only half the time.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.709
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

38:54.792 --> 38:57.128
She called up here for you not too long ago.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.132
She couldn't help me anyway, man.
She sounded fucked up.

39:01.215 --> 39:03.009
You see, that's exactly the kind of thing

39:03.092 --> 39:05.261
that we do want to know about
though, Charlie.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.762
All right.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.932
I needed some scratch for my store,

39:10.016 --> 39:13.102
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fucking phone,

39:13.185 --> 39:16.480
so got a number to her friend Carla,
got her to call me back,

39:16.564 --> 39:18.607
and she ain't made no fucking sense.

39:18.899 --> 39:21.986
Carla's full name and phone number.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.989
What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

39:25.948 --> 39:28.117
Like she could duck hunt with a rake.

39:29.243 --> 39:30.619
High, yeah.

39:31.579 --> 39:34.206
Talking about she's gonna become a nun.

39:34.999 --> 39:37.376
- Why a nun?
- I don't know, man. She was high.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.003
Fucked up.

39:39.170 --> 39:42.757
Talking about she met a king.

39:43.466 --> 39:44.884
Yeah.

39:44.967 --> 39:49.138
Anyway, I don't need no snitch jacket
up in here.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.807
Give me a break.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.353
This is Avoyelles. It's a goddamn day camp.

39:56.979 --> 39:59.065
Spend some time in Angola.

39:59.857 --> 40:02.193
Surprised you even got Aryan Nation here.

40:04.987 --> 40:06.363
What'd Dori do?

40:10.242 --> 40:11.827
Dori's dead.

40:13.746 --> 40:17.249
<i>Thank you, boys.
We almost had a moment there.</i>

40:32.348 --> 40:35.101
So, you want to talk the whole case through
or just the end?

40:35.184 --> 40:38.104
No. The whole story
from your end, if you don't mind.

40:38.187 --> 40:41.857
You know, like he said, files got ruined.
Hurricane Rita.

40:44.860 --> 40:48.489
What he didn't say is that
this is about something else.

40:49.949 --> 40:52.993
Something new.
That one in Lake Charles, maybe?

40:53.953 --> 40:55.704
Now, why you say that?

40:55.788 --> 40:58.541
Kept the details out of the paper.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.544
Yeah, we did. You know anything about that?

41:02.169 --> 41:03.546
About Lake Charles?

41:04.797 --> 41:08.342
You ought to let me see what you got,
jog my memory.

41:08.425 --> 41:11.679
Let's hear your story first.
See how it fits with what we got.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.684
Well, your dime, boss.

41:17.560 --> 41:21.188
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner you mentioned,

41:21.272 --> 41:22.773
he turned up drunk?

41:22.857 --> 41:29.155
Well, that dinner, that was a bit later.

41:30.823 --> 41:34.118
He was kind of funny. The flowers, you know.

41:34.201 --> 41:37.496
Like he read somewhere
that if you get invited to dinner,

41:37.580 --> 41:39.748
you're supposed to bring flowers.

41:40.875 --> 41:41.917
<i>What the hell?</i>

41:42.293 --> 41:44.295
You can barely stand up.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.924
What, you don't drink with me or the boys,

41:49.383 --> 41:52.678
and you got to get a load on
before you visit my family?

41:52.761 --> 41:54.638
No, Marty, it's not like that.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.101
I didn't mean to, all right?

42:01.770 --> 42:04.523
I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble with it before.

42:04.607 --> 42:06.233
I didn't mean to.

42:10.279 --> 42:14.074
I was checking out a CI
and ended up hanging around a bar.

42:17.369 --> 42:20.915
I was sitting there,
and I couldn't think of a good reason not to.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.793
Usually I can.

42:30.925 --> 42:32.885
Don't worry about it.

42:33.677 --> 42:38.098
Have some more coffee and just try
to make 10 minutes of conversation.

42:38.182 --> 42:39.642
You got it.

42:40.643 --> 42:44.396
I'll call Chris or somebody,
get you out of here.

42:47.149 --> 42:48.400
Marty.

42:51.445 --> 42:53.030
I'm sorry, man.

42:54.281 --> 42:55.824
Forget it.

42:56.659 --> 42:58.953
We'll try this some other time.

43:10.172 --> 43:13.676
<i>Well, Rust,
it is so nice to finally meet you.</i>

43:14.468 --> 43:16.720
Sorry it took so long.

43:16.804 --> 43:19.765
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

43:19.848 --> 43:23.394
I said that your life's
in this man's hands, right?

43:23.477 --> 43:25.271
Of course you should meet the family.

43:26.605 --> 43:29.566
Well, not quite as dramatic as that, hon.

43:30.359 --> 43:31.860
I've never fired my gun.

43:32.194 --> 43:33.862
Have you fired your gun?

43:33.946 --> 43:35.114
Audrey.

43:39.493 --> 43:40.536
Yes.

43:41.328 --> 43:42.329
You shot people?

43:42.413 --> 43:43.706
Macie.

43:46.166 --> 43:47.710
Dad's never shot anybody.

43:48.711 --> 43:50.379
Well, that's good.

43:51.463 --> 43:52.715
You don't want to shoot people.

43:53.173 --> 43:54.425
But you have.

43:56.302 --> 43:58.512
Marty says you're from Texas.

43:59.596 --> 44:01.098
Yes, south Texas.

44:01.807 --> 44:04.643
I grew up in Alaska.

44:04.727 --> 44:07.354
Just been working here the last 10, 12 years.

44:07.438 --> 44:09.148
What kind of work?

44:10.399 --> 44:12.151
Narcotics, mostly.

44:14.570 --> 44:17.740
I was on the robbery squad in Houston
until '89.

44:19.450 --> 44:21.076
Be right back.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.287
Y'all keep eating.

44:28.625 --> 44:30.419
Do you like your job?

44:34.089 --> 44:35.716
Not exactly.

44:36.216 --> 44:38.177
It's worthwhile.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.887
I'm good at it.

44:40.763 --> 44:42.556
You're not married?

44:44.308 --> 44:45.851
Once.

44:45.934 --> 44:47.770
Not anymore.

44:48.604 --> 44:50.939
Did you do this while you were married?

44:51.440 --> 44:53.067
Hey, Chris.

44:53.817 --> 44:55.819
Hey, thanks for the page.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.239
Yeah, well, he'll appreciate it.

45:00.699 --> 45:03.452
Well, all right, then I appreciate it.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.003
Children?

45:13.796 --> 45:15.005
One.

45:16.465 --> 45:18.175
She passed.

45:19.343 --> 45:21.970
Marriage didn't last long after that.

45:24.306 --> 45:25.474
Sorry.

45:28.435 --> 45:30.229
Chris Demma's on the phone for you.

45:30.312 --> 45:33.357
Something about a CI or...

45:33.690 --> 45:35.609
Back there to the left.

45:36.318 --> 45:37.653
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.792
What was that?

45:51.875 --> 45:54.002
What were y'all talking about?

45:54.086 --> 45:55.587
Your job.

45:56.547 --> 45:58.173
What do you know about him, Marty?

46:02.469 --> 46:03.929
Not a lot.

46:04.012 --> 46:06.598
He could be a good detective.

46:06.682 --> 46:09.184
He's running on this thing, but...

46:10.102 --> 46:11.145
Uppity.

46:14.314 --> 46:15.482
What?

46:16.775 --> 46:18.444
Have you ever asked him about himself?

46:20.404 --> 46:24.825
Baby, trust me,
you do not want to pick this man's brain.

46:29.997 --> 46:31.248
What was that?

46:31.331 --> 46:34.084
Some details on the CI.

46:39.047 --> 46:42.050
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.
This looks great.

46:42.134 --> 46:43.427
My pleasure.

46:43.510 --> 46:46.805
- I don't like that broccoli.
- Mind your manners.

46:46.889 --> 46:49.808
So you need to go or what?

46:51.477 --> 46:54.313
No, it's nothing can't wait till tomorrow.

46:55.981 --> 46:59.818
Rust, what you were saying before?

47:03.280 --> 47:06.033
We can find something nicer to talk about.

47:07.034 --> 47:09.495
Marty, I saw your table in there.

47:09.578 --> 47:11.330
You fly fish?

47:12.247 --> 47:13.707
Little bit.

47:15.584 --> 47:18.921
<i>So, you and Cohle
went bad in '02, huh?</i>

47:19.922 --> 47:21.340
Heard about that.

47:21.423 --> 47:22.925
Yeah, well,

47:23.300 --> 47:28.096
what happened between me and him
don't have nothing to do with Dora Lange.

47:30.098 --> 47:32.935
I worked with Rust Cohle for seven years.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.730
People change, relationships change.

47:38.649 --> 47:40.108
You stay in touch?

47:41.902 --> 47:43.529
No.

47:43.612 --> 47:46.031
No, I haven't talked to Rust in

47:47.950 --> 47:49.409
10 years.

47:50.702 --> 47:51.787
Yeah.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.125
Look, however we...

47:57.209 --> 47:59.461
He was a good detective.

48:00.462 --> 48:03.549
And it don't matter how we ended it. I mean...

48:04.925 --> 48:07.511
I can say that because it's the truth.

48:08.262 --> 48:11.390
And I don't hold grudges.

48:11.974 --> 48:15.185
I believe that's the shit that leads to cancer.

48:20.274 --> 48:23.360
But why am I talking about dinner?

48:23.443 --> 48:27.155
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

48:30.075 --> 48:33.203
This other stuff... What's going on?

48:33.620 --> 48:36.081
Sorry. We just heard some stories.

48:36.832 --> 48:40.377
Well, personally, I heard
he was an ace case man, right?

48:40.460 --> 48:42.421
I'd like to understand his process.

48:47.050 --> 48:49.177
Process. Sure.

48:51.430 --> 48:55.309
The other landlord says
she trashed the place, so she lost her deposit.

48:55.392 --> 48:57.519
And her neighbors check out.

48:57.603 --> 49:02.774
Those that remember her said that
she used to come in early in the morning,

49:02.858 --> 49:05.277
if she came home at all.

49:08.238 --> 49:10.324
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

49:13.827 --> 49:15.454
Up your ass, Cohle.

49:15.537 --> 49:19.124
Why don't you do your own fucking leg work,
you rat fuck?

49:24.046 --> 49:25.839
Say it again, rummy.

49:25.922 --> 49:27.215
Hey.

49:31.428 --> 49:33.513
You know what, man?

49:33.597 --> 49:35.474
Fuck you,

49:35.557 --> 49:37.017
Tax Man.

49:42.064 --> 49:43.106
What the fuck?

49:44.566 --> 49:45.859
Back to point.

49:45.942 --> 49:47.986
Got three hits on working girls.

49:48.070 --> 49:50.906
No one close to her, naturally.

49:50.989 --> 49:53.742
A few names recognized her as occasional.

49:53.825 --> 49:55.494
Like she tricked now and then,

49:55.577 --> 49:58.622
show up at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

49:59.373 --> 50:00.874
You got some names. Which ones?

50:00.957 --> 50:04.544
I heard from my AP guy, Marie Fontenot.

50:04.628 --> 50:08.173
Said her uncle's Danny Fontenot.
Pitcher, LSU.

50:08.256 --> 50:11.510
Yeah, I watched him play. Great player.

50:11.593 --> 50:13.720
Well, he lives close by.

50:13.804 --> 50:15.347
Well, thanks, guys.

50:16.431 --> 50:18.600
What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

50:18.684 --> 50:20.227
Not much, sir.

50:20.310 --> 50:24.231
Well, you might know the Reverend Tuttle.

50:24.314 --> 50:26.483
He runs our statewide charity drive.

50:26.566 --> 50:28.485
This is Detective Hart, Detective Cohle.

50:28.568 --> 50:29.986
- Very good to meet you, Officers.
- Pleasure, sir.

50:30.070 --> 50:31.321
Rustin Cohle.

50:31.405 --> 50:37.119
Your case has a lot of people taking care,
doors locking where they used to not.

50:37.619 --> 50:41.123
Eddie's been speaking to me about it.
Concerned, very concerned.

50:41.415 --> 50:43.875
We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

50:43.959 --> 50:46.628
to investigate crimes
with an anti-Christian connotation.

50:46.712 --> 50:49.089
You what? Really?

50:51.967 --> 50:52.968
Yes.

50:56.138 --> 50:59.516
I don't mean to tell men of your positions,

50:59.599 --> 51:03.019
but there is a war happening behind things.

51:05.897 --> 51:07.190
Thank you for doing your part.

51:07.274 --> 51:09.234
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

51:10.652 --> 51:12.237
Well,

51:13.488 --> 51:18.160
Eddie's going to be very, very pleased
to have such good men working on this.

51:23.039 --> 51:26.126
- Are you kidding me?
- Un-fucking-believable.

51:27.169 --> 51:30.005
"Anti-Christian." Fucks.

51:30.756 --> 51:32.215
And who the fuck's Eddie?

51:35.010 --> 51:36.219
Is he serious?

51:36.303 --> 51:38.430
Well, he doesn't have a television.

51:38.513 --> 51:40.307
- Who's Eddie?
- And he's from Texas.

51:40.390 --> 51:44.269
He's the fucking governor. Edwin Tuttle.

51:44.352 --> 51:46.062
They're first cousins.

51:46.855 --> 51:47.939
Well, that makes sense.

51:48.023 --> 51:50.567
Yeah, that's the sound
of the big machine, Cohle.

51:50.650 --> 51:52.903
It's gearing up to pound your ass.

51:53.487 --> 51:55.947
It's the sound of a gaggle of hens.

51:56.031 --> 51:59.701
Yeah, you better watch your mouth
or they're gonna peck your eyes out.

52:02.287 --> 52:03.288
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:03.371 --> 52:07.250
I'm looking for Detective Hart.
I have a stack of depositions for him.

52:07.334 --> 52:11.588
Judge Sutpen told me to make sure and give
them to Detective Hart and no one else, so...

52:11.671 --> 52:14.049
- Is that the...
- The depositions.

52:14.132 --> 52:16.343
I thought I should walk you through them.

52:16.426 --> 52:19.304
Great, great. Let's just find a place to talk.

52:19.387 --> 52:20.555
Thanks, Cathleen.

52:20.639 --> 52:22.224
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52:22.307 --> 52:24.017
Right through here.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.296
<i>Your victim was Dora Lange,</i>

52:54.589 --> 52:57.092
but you all checked on Marie Fontenot. Why?

52:58.426 --> 53:01.179
Missing girl, five years gone,
report made in error.

53:01.263 --> 53:04.266
She had an uncle who lived nearby.

53:05.767 --> 53:07.686
And call it intuition.

53:10.564 --> 53:12.899
Sometimes he's more responsive.

53:12.983 --> 53:14.401
I'd like to help.

53:21.074 --> 53:23.034
Mr. Fontenot. No way.

53:29.499 --> 53:33.628
We met maybe seven years ago.

53:34.212 --> 53:38.216
I was visiting Skip Hays. I'd played for USL.

53:38.925 --> 53:41.928
A thing of beauty, sir, watching you throw.

53:43.638 --> 53:47.726
Danny, this man's a detective, with the police.

53:47.809 --> 53:51.146
He's talking to me
like I'm a child.

53:55.525 --> 53:58.069
I'm actually... Sorry...

53:58.737 --> 54:01.531
We wanted to ask you
about your niece, Marie.

54:03.283 --> 54:06.328
"How much could you put on one family?"
I ask the Lord.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.872
We try to get by.

54:09.873 --> 54:11.833
Did you know Marie's birth father?

54:11.917 --> 54:13.543
Len?

54:13.627 --> 54:15.420
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

54:17.172 --> 54:18.381
It's okay.

54:18.465 --> 54:20.800
We're asking because

54:20.884 --> 54:24.721
we had heard that Marie ran off with him
and they...

54:25.305 --> 54:26.473
She wasn't really missing.

54:29.601 --> 54:31.519
That's what Debbie said.

54:32.187 --> 54:36.107
Well, anybody heard from Len?

54:36.191 --> 54:38.985
Anybody maybe knows where he's at?

54:43.657 --> 54:46.326
Sorry. The last thing.

54:46.409 --> 54:47.953
Do you know where Debbie is now?

54:48.036 --> 54:52.374
She married another man,
not the one she was with when Marie...

54:53.875 --> 54:56.044
She was in Vegas, last we heard.

55:19.567 --> 55:22.320
- Marie must have loved it here.
- Yeah.

55:23.154 --> 55:26.408
- All this for her?
- Danny loved her so much.

55:27.534 --> 55:31.162
We weren't her legal guardians,
but she played here all the time.

55:31.246 --> 55:32.580
More than her mama's.

55:33.248 --> 55:34.749
I can see why.

55:36.084 --> 55:39.921
What is it Dan has,
if you don't mind my asking?

55:40.005 --> 55:43.008
All they ever told us
was a cerebral event.

55:43.842 --> 55:45.844
A series of strokes, like.

55:54.102 --> 55:55.478
Marty?

55:58.106 --> 56:00.275
Excuse me one sec.

56:11.119 --> 56:13.621
Inside, on the floor, on the right.

56:33.266 --> 56:34.768
I don't know what that is.

56:34.851 --> 56:38.146
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

56:45.904 --> 56:48.239
<i>I bet you want to hear
the hero shot, huh?</i>

56:49.824 --> 56:52.786
The place we carried the kids out?

56:53.286 --> 56:55.163
Eventually, sure.

56:57.874 --> 56:59.959
So, what did she look like?

57:00.919 --> 57:02.837
That one in Lake Charles?

57:27.862 --> 57:31.658
Can you tell us anything
about that, Mr. Cohle?

57:36.538 --> 57:39.749
That looks a lot like the one from '95,

57:40.583 --> 57:42.168
but, well, you knew that already.

57:42.252 --> 57:46.297
Yeah, there are specifics
consistent to the '95 case,

57:46.381 --> 57:48.883
details that weren't public knowledge.

57:50.552 --> 57:53.471
You were off the grid for eight years, right?

57:53.555 --> 57:55.974
- Show back up here 2010.
- My question is...

57:56.057 --> 57:58.309
How could it be him

58:00.854 --> 58:03.314
if we already caught him in '95?

58:06.359 --> 58:08.236
How indeed, Detectives?

58:09.737 --> 58:12.198
I figured
you'd be the one to know.

58:20.790 --> 58:23.877
Then start asking the right fucking questions.
