We've had some problem with Kerrey people
ripping down our signs...

but we're gonna take care of that.

- [Onlookers Laughing]
- Um, other than —

02:29.191 --> 02:32.401
- [Man] They're gonna ask them not to.
- Yeah.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.655
We also have a schizophrenic newspaper
which, like...

02:35.739 --> 02:40.243
prints every shit possible on the front page
and then apologizes in the editorial.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.828
It's really bizarre.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.997
The Tsongas sign on Route 3
lasted all of two days.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.792
- It's gone now.
- [Laughter]

02:47.876 --> 02:50.920
[Man] Those Harkin people
are stealin' everyone's signs. It's amazing.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.799
Short of, uh, calling for negative ads —
although maybe —

02:54.883 --> 02:58.928
is there any effort underfoot
to go after Tsongas?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.264
Let's face it.
This guy cannot be squeaky clean.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.517
[Man] Sure. Well, this is the question about that,
and let's throw that out here.

03:04.601 --> 03:09.063
The problem with attacking Senator Tsongas is —
I mean, we jokingly call him St. Paul.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.358
It could really backfire against us
to someone else's advantage.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.318
- Absolutely.
- Um, and that's been —

03:14.403 --> 03:15.820
That's what —
[Clears Throat]

03:15.904 --> 03:19.031
[Man] And it'll look bad,
because he's complimented him all along.

03:19.116 --> 03:23.536
And then to come the last week and say
that he's bad — I think it will look bad.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.080
We have to do a better job
of saying our differences.

03:26.164 --> 03:30.126
We always seem to be defending.
We don't have to defend a damn thing.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.212
We got the best — We know he's
the best candidate, 'cause we've met him.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.381
And if everybody in the state
of New Hampshire met him...

03:35.465 --> 03:37.300
we wouldn't have a problem —
we know that.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.139
Thank you.
I'm glad to be with you.

I wasn't in the leather jacket group,
but, uh...

03:48.812 --> 03:50.938
you know, I had a good time.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.773
But I was a pretty straight kid.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.775
I worked hard enough
to make good grades...

03:54.860 --> 03:58.779
but I basically liked my music
and my friends...

03:58.864 --> 04:02.325
and I had a heck of a good time
when I was in high school.

04:03.493 --> 04:08.664
We had a band in high school called
The Three Kings. I've still got a record.

Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover
for 12 years...

05:59.401 --> 06:04.155
and for the past two years I have lied to the press
about our relationship to protect him.

06:06.992 --> 06:10.119
The truth is, I loved him.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.789
Now he tells me to deny it.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.169
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit...

your relationship with Gennifer Flowers?

There really isn't one, obviously.

06:49.659 --> 06:54.497

to publish a story...

06:54.581 --> 06:59.251
that she hired a lawyer to say
was absolutely defamatory over a year ago.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.796
And, uh, it's sad.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.174
It's sad that this sort of thing
could be published...

07:05.258 --> 07:09.428
in a newspaper like the Star
which says Martians walk on the earth.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.306

if Martians walk on the earth.

- [Man] So somebody broke in your apartment?
- [Flowers] Well, yeah.

There wasn't any sign of a break-in,
but the drawers and things —

07:34.162 --> 07:36.705
There wasn't anything missing
that I could tell, but somebody had —

gone through all your stuff.

- [Man] Yeah.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.821

- [Man] I don't know. I just —

[Flowers] You usually call me, for that matter.
And besides, who would know?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.995

about the allegations from Gennifer Flowers
and the tape recordings?

08:28.925 --> 08:33.095
She was worried about being assumed to be
guilty just because her name was brought in.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.597
I said, "That's not true.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.976
Even if your name gets used, in the absence
of proof, nobody can prove you're guilty.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.395
Don't worry about it. Tell the truth. Just tell 'em
that you didn't do it." That's all I ever said.

at any time tell you on the telephone...

to just tell the truth
about what happened?

Ladies and gentlemen — Ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna put this to a stop...

09:16.514 --> 09:19.642
if there are any further questions
that are degrading, in my opinion, like that.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.435
Now, right here, sir.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.188
[Male Reporter]
You were paid by the Star.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.566
Did anyone ever approach you
from the Republican Party —

09:27.651 --> 09:31.820
perhaps another Democratic candidate —
to urge you to tell this story publicly?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.489
- Yes, they did.
- Who?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.908
- I can't say.
- Wait. You're saying —

09:35.992 --> 09:40.079
Wait, are you saying
that somebody from another campaign —

09:40.163 --> 09:43.749
Democratic Party or Republican Party —
approached you to tell this story?

09:43.833 --> 09:46.919
Was it the Democratic Party
or was it the Republican Party, Ms. Flowers?

09:47.003 --> 09:49.255
It was the Republican Party.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.049
We knew we'd get attacks,
but, I mean, you know —

09:52.133 --> 09:56.262
We just couldn't believe the press would
pick up a tabloid story that somebody —

09:56.346 --> 09:59.223
I mean, we're at a new low in a way.
That's why it's so important.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.183
But we are fighting back.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.602
Somebody who's been through
a lot of tough elections...

10:03.687 --> 10:06.605
is James Carville, who's known
as the Ragin' Cajun in the business.

10:06.690 --> 10:10.276
- [Scattered Applause]
- We'd like him to say a couple of words to you.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.198
[Carville] Uh, we have a tough fight
comin' right down the stretch.

10:16.283 --> 10:21.495
It's gonna come out that Roger Ailes is behind
a lot of this stuff before the election...

10:21.579 --> 10:25.040
that you been seein'
about Governor Clinton.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.627
- Okay? Ailes.
- [Man] Boo!

10:28.712 --> 10:32.631
And of course Bush
and Georgette Mosbacher and everything.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.467
Let me tell you
what's at stake in this election.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.847
Every time that somebody comes along
that's got some ideas —

10:39.931 --> 10:41.473
a Democrat comes along —

10:41.558 --> 10:44.476
the Republicans come up here
and they ambush him.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.146
Remember Muskie?
Okay?

10:47.230 --> 10:50.357
That is standard procedure.
And here comes Clinton.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.110
He comes to New Hampshire.
People here are hurtin'.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.780
They want hope. They want somebody
with vision. He gives it to 'em.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.782
So what do Republicans do?

10:58.867 --> 11:01.827
They get together with their wedge issues
and they knock it off.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.664
If they succeed this time,
it's gonna be every time.

11:05.749 --> 11:10.878
You are never going to get
a presidential candidate. Okay?

11:10.962 --> 11:13.547
You're never gonna get somebody
to come up here and run for president...

11:13.631 --> 11:16.967
that's served 11 years as governor
who's got any kind of experience.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.346
Okay? And every time somebody
comes up, they're gonna do it.

11:20.430 --> 11:25.517
If we win this, then you have
knocked this shit back forever.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.228
- [Applause]
- Okay?

11:33.693 --> 11:37.613
And every time that we get a Democrat
that we can believe in...

11:37.697 --> 11:41.200
Roger Ailes
a-a-and Georgette Mosbacher —

11:41.284 --> 11:43.994
You know that she's the secretary
of the person closest to Bush.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.579
You know what she said?

11:45.663 --> 11:50.042
She can't wait till this election's over so
she can get her Maserati and her jewels back.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.128
That's the mind-set you're fightin' against.
And if they beat us back —

11:53.213 --> 11:57.049
Paul Tsongas —
Look, he ain't gonna win anything, okay?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.885
This is not about Paul Tsongas.

11:59.969 --> 12:04.765
It's about George Bush and Roger Ailes
and Georgette Mosbacher...

12:04.849 --> 12:08.936
and the whole sleazy little cabal of 'em
that wanna keep hold of anything...

12:09.020 --> 12:11.772
and that wanna knock anybody off
that we believe in...

12:11.856 --> 12:13.524
and anything that we care about.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.235
And if we beat them
and you're out there...

12:16.319 --> 12:19.905
and your knuckles get tired
or your feet get cold or anything else...

12:19.989 --> 12:21.365
you think about that.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.575
Because if they knock us off,
then so what?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.994
The next one that comes up,
they gonna knock the next one off.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.330
- [Applause, Cheering]
- And the next one and everything else.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.332
And you know what kind of shit
you're gonna get?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.584
You're gonna get the kind
of Supreme Court that you got.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.338
You're gonna get the kind of four different
positions on civil rights that you get from 'em.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.382
You gonna get tax breaks for the wealthy.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.052
You gonna get a guy that doesn't know
what a grocery store scanner is. Okay?

12:42.137 --> 12:45.931
So let's go. We got —
You know, we got six more days to go.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.434
And don't forget
who the real enemy is in here.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.395
And don't forget what we're really
campaigning against. Thank y'all very much.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.355

[Female Announcer] Some say his campaign
appears to slip further every day.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.422
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
remains tight-lipped...

13:18.506 --> 13:21.467
about a controversial letter
regarding the Vietnam draft.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.886
Ask the president
when he gets off the plane...

13:23.970 --> 13:26.180
to call the Pentagon
and ask how the letter got out.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.974
W-W-Wait a minute.
What do we got here?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.727
What is the Pentagon doing
in the middle of a political campaign?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.563
And what is the Pentagon doing
leaking something...

13:34.647 --> 13:38.192
that we asked for November 6
that they didn't give us?

13:38.276 --> 13:41.653
Now, Governor Clinton has a character problem,
but I take it that your line of...

13:41.738 --> 13:45.073
Governor Clinton has no character problem.
He's passed his character test.

13:45.158 --> 13:50.162
Well, I mean, he has not denied
that he has engaged in marital infidelity.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.663
He denied a specific one.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.665
- He has said that
he had problems in his marriage.
- That's right.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.752
And he has talked about the draft.
And to some people, it's a character problem.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.048
Bill Clinton's passed his character test
throughout his life and throughout this campaign.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.383
And he's shown it through
his commitments to real fights.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.803
What he's gonna do in this campaign is focus
on what's important to the American people —

14:06.888 --> 14:08.305
on jobs and education.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.350
That's what the American people care about.
They wanna move into the future.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.143
They don't want to be
diverted by side issues...

14:13.228 --> 14:15.521
and they're not gonna let
the Republican attack machine divert them.

too much for Clinton to survive.

that he's done to this country?

is that we have two kinds of signs.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.639
- So that's pri —
- which means that it was primary money.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.474
- Still government money.
- It's still...

49:37.558 --> 49:40.727
I have a feeling it's R.N.C.,
is what I've thought all along.

49:40.811 --> 49:42.562
- No, it can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.731
- It can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.232
It's illegal.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.817
- Let's hope it's R.N.C.
- The issue's moot.

49:47.902 --> 49:51.905
All we got to do is go out and get
the latest filing and see if there's a check.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.324
I think we looked on it earlier.
We didn't find it.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.076
We'll check now with updates.

49:56.160 --> 49:59.412
It's possible it's a subcontract,
you know, that —

49:59.497 --> 50:03.583
In fact, it is likely that they've done this
through their — maybe it was a media firm...

50:03.668 --> 50:05.919
and it was subcontracted
through the media firm.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.504
It's unlikely there's a direct check.

50:07.588 --> 50:10.423
No, but somebody said,
if you look at the translation...

50:10.508 --> 50:13.009
that they went to Ohio and Texas
and California.

50:13.094 --> 50:15.428
- Right, but it could be —
- And where they came was Rio.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.097
- All we can do is check —
- [Laughing]

50:17.181 --> 50:19.683
- They came to Rio.
- We gotta respond —

50:19.767 --> 50:23.853
What should be our response
to the Brazil thing?

50:25.606 --> 50:27.857
[Greenberg] We're stunned.
We're speechless. We can't respond.

50:27.942 --> 50:28.942
[Laughing]

50:29.026 --> 50:33.029
What's his 60-second spot? What does
he say about American jobs in his spot?

50:33.948 --> 50:35.615
What is it?
What do people think about Bush?

50:35.700 --> 50:39.202
He cares more about foreign things,
and he cares more about rich people.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.954
- Foreign.
- Yeah.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.707
There's something —
We knew he spent a lot of time overseas.

50:43.791 --> 50:46.292
Now he's spending a lot of taxpayer money
over there, or something.

50:46.377 --> 50:49.796
Foreign aid is something —
something like that.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.965
We knew he didn't care much
about creating American jobs —

50:52.049 --> 50:54.634
No, here it is.
He's finally got a jobs program.

50:54.719 --> 50:56.302
Too bad it's for Rio.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.637
[Chuckling]

50:57.722 --> 50:59.973
[Carville]
Hey, what's the song about Rio?

51:02.226 --> 51:03.893
What rhymes with Rio?

51:07.898 --> 51:09.441
It's better than we even thought.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.609
- The two highest business failures —
- Yeah?

51:11.694 --> 51:13.611
Are New York and California
in the piece.

51:13.696 --> 51:16.072
Business failures in the country —
leading in New York and California.

51:16.157 --> 51:19.242
The two states they didn't go to
for the printing is New York and California.

51:19.326 --> 51:22.495
Goddamn.
Has she said what their reaction is yet?

51:22.580 --> 51:25.331
- I just talked to her.
- Okay. All right.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.417
[Stephanopoulos] It's leading the news,
and she's sending me the script.

51:27.501 --> 51:28.668
[Carville]
Okay.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.920
Hey, Governor, how you doing?

51:31.756 --> 51:32.839
All right.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.925
Printing —
Print materials in Brazil.

51:36.010 --> 51:38.261
Pictures of— Yeah.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.681
Yeah. They're gonna lead with it.

51:41.766 --> 51:45.018
All right?
[Chewing Loudly]

51:46.771 --> 51:48.938
Well, let's see what happens on the news.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.943
Yeah, I can call to up there.

51:54.528 --> 51:57.864
Just checked it out.
Every single penny spent in the U.S.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.074
- Ours?
- Yes.

52:00.159 --> 52:03.745
- Is somebody asking?
- Get a quote on that.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.372
Did they ever call you back and say
what the Bush reaction was?

52:06.457 --> 52:08.666
Yes. You're gonna —

52:08.751 --> 52:12.837
I called Mary, and she goes,
"Is this bad?"

52:12.922 --> 52:16.341
[Laughing]

52:16.425 --> 52:18.885
"Is this bad?"

52:18.969 --> 52:21.095
I said, "Susan, you better tell her
it's pretty bad."

52:23.057 --> 52:24.933
They don't understand.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.518
[Man]
Oh, they will.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.980
If the president of the United States
don't know where $65 million...

52:31.065 --> 52:32.565
of his campaign money goes...

52:32.650 --> 52:36.986
how can you expect to know where
$1.4 trillion of taxpayer monies go?

52:37.071 --> 52:38.988
- Huh? Does that work?
- [Groans]

52:39.073 --> 52:41.324
I think it's better just to say, you know —

52:41.408 --> 52:43.368
Oh, my God, that is —

52:43.452 --> 52:46.538
- [Carville] What's wrong? What's wrong?
- The guy's story is completely incredible.

52:46.622 --> 52:49.165
He says that he did it on his own.
He dumped $40,000 on his own.

52:49.250 --> 52:51.167
- Give me a break.
- Where are the signs then?

52:51.252 --> 52:53.169
That's what she's trying —
The guy won't return her phone call.

52:53.254 --> 52:55.171
- [Phone Dialing]
- Well, when I was talking to her...

52:55.256 --> 52:58.675
she said he was on another line
and she'd call me back, so let's see.

52:58.759 --> 53:02.011
They're bullshitting you. They —

53:02.096 --> 53:04.264
But — But let me —

53:04.348 --> 53:06.266
Okay. But the link is this —

53:06.350 --> 53:10.854
They have printed materials
that were printed in Brazil, okay?

53:10.938 --> 53:13.690
What do they say happened
to the materials?

53:16.277 --> 53:18.820
Yeah, but if they can't produce
the materials...

53:18.904 --> 53:21.865
then they either got 'em
or they were given to 'em.

53:21.949 --> 53:25.618
If they were given to 'em,
that's a violation of F.E.C. Law.

53:26.579 --> 53:28.079
Call me back. Bye.

53:30.291 --> 53:33.293
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a tremendous honor and a privilege...

53:33.377 --> 53:35.420
to welcome back to the Ozarks...

53:35.504 --> 53:39.090
the president of the United States,
George Bush!

53:40.759 --> 53:43.720
[TV Continues, Indistinct]

53:46.390 --> 53:48.558
[Carville]
What is the matter today?

53:48.642 --> 53:52.979
Every time somebody farts the word "draft,"
it's on the front page of the paper.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.398
It's not! Okay.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.401
I'm gonna see how many stories
there are on the draft...

53:58.485 --> 54:01.654
and how many stories there are on
George Bush's election year promises.

54:02.990 --> 54:04.365
Okay?

54:05.910 --> 54:08.244
Oh... Oh, oh, oh, oh!

54:08.329 --> 54:10.914
A lot more. A lot more.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.000
Okay. I'm gonna go back and see.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.670
You know, George Bush
mentioned the draft one time.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.255
He mentioned it one time...

54:19.340 --> 54:22.175
and let's see how many stories
that was written on the draft.

54:23.761 --> 54:27.430
Oh, okay. Well, you said if you wanna
say something, then say something.

54:27.514 --> 54:31.434
I'm giving you an example
of there's a lot more fascination...

54:31.518 --> 54:34.604
with the quote, "draft issue," unquote,
or Gennifer Flowers...

54:34.688 --> 54:38.149
than there is with George Bush
promising $16 zillion more...

54:38.233 --> 54:40.777
than he could ever spend
in an election year.

54:41.445 --> 54:43.613
I believe that on any number of things...

54:43.697 --> 54:45.782
that we are held to a different standard.

54:45.866 --> 54:48.284
I think it is absolutely ludicrous...

54:48.369 --> 54:51.788
that no one ever asked George Bush
about Iran-Contra.

54:51.872 --> 54:54.707
Two cabinet secretaries
saying Bush was lying.

54:54.792 --> 54:58.294
No one ever said a damn thing.
You get this memo from Baker...

54:58.379 --> 55:02.382
about him knowing about —
about Iraq having chemical weapons going.

55:02.466 --> 55:05.343
And then there's no follow-up because,
God, you can't askJim Baker a question.

55:05.427 --> 55:09.847
This man is down deep —
He's beyond being questioned.

55:09.932 --> 55:13.142
He gives everybody tickets to the opera.
We can't question him.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.185
You know?

55:14.269 --> 55:17.397
This is not directed any more
at the Washington Post.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.941
I've had this conversation
with everybody today.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.736
You know, I am so goddamn tired...

55:23.821 --> 55:25.530
of this goddamn double standard...

55:25.614 --> 55:28.241
where the press lets these sons of bitches
get away with murder...

55:28.325 --> 55:29.826
and every little thing that we do —

55:29.910 --> 55:32.912
"Clinton's numbers don't add up!
Clinton's numbers don't add up!"

55:32.997 --> 55:34.497
- That is so fucking true.
- You know?

55:34.581 --> 55:35.999
It's so unbelievable.

55:36.083 --> 55:40.920
If we say 50 plus 50 is 104,
and they say 50 plus 50 is 104,000...

55:41.005 --> 55:43.506
they'll say, "Well, both of them are stretching
their numbers a little bit."

55:43.590 --> 55:45.508
- Hello? Yeah.
- [Laughs] Exactly.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.593
Oh, the goddamn stories.

55:47.678 --> 55:50.805
They're not going with the story.

55:50.889 --> 55:52.598
The printing... The —

55:54.059 --> 55:55.852
Printing the, uh —
Shit, you know.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.771
[Carville] I think that they've given up
on it now, Governor.

55:58.856 --> 56:01.774
The Bush people said they got the guy wired,
said, "Well, I just did it.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.735
It was an offshore operation," you know?

56:03.819 --> 56:07.530
So they're trying to nail him. So it's not
dead, but it's just not going tonight.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.824
[Woman On TV In Background, Indistinct]

56:10.701 --> 56:14.454
That the guy just did it himself
and he just spent the money himself...

56:14.538 --> 56:16.914
and they never authorized it.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.208
Okay. Give me a call later, okay?
All right.

56:19.293 --> 56:21.961
This morning Perot was on
CBS Morning News...

56:22.046 --> 56:24.630
claimed that he made a mistake
by getting out of the race.

56:24.715 --> 56:28.259
Perot volunteer army, despite
the disconnection of the 800 number...

56:28.343 --> 56:30.762
was supplied with four million dollars
in August.

56:30.846 --> 56:32.930
He noted they're gaining
some strength and confidence...

56:33.015 --> 56:37.060
thanks to his repeated hints about
becoming an official candidate.

56:37.144 --> 56:42.315
We lost some Perot people who went back
over to the other side in a couple different states.

56:42.399 --> 56:45.568
Um, on the creative chicken side...

56:45.652 --> 56:47.653

"Poultry workers for Bush."

Hello? Yeah.

so there ain't no position to have.

One of those who will be doing some
serious spinning from the right...

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:05.810
is Mary Matalin...

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.187
the deputy campaign manager
for the Bush/Quayle campaign.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.606
Ms. Matalin, let's talk about
first the polls.

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:13.109
They are behind in the polls.
There's no way to deny that.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.027
What is George Bush
going to say tonight...

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.488
that hopefully, in his case,
will turn things around?

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.991

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.538

in fiction writing when this is over.

Wow. What a crowd.

The thought of preparing

is daunting, to say the least.

- Give 'em a Perot.

- [Imitating Ross Perot] Well, okay.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:54.650

fascinating that y'all in national media —

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.902
Okay, y'all — you never want
to talk about the deficit.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:22.845
The first thing is that
since there are four debates...

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.264
the first one is incredibly important.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:29.185
And we want to establish ourselves
as the folks that the press can trust...

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.687
or they'll either go to their own
research departments...

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:34.857
which are pretty incompetent,
or they'll come to the campaign.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:39.695

our responses are, the better.

in there spinning immediately afterwards.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:45.409

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.041

there first with our answers.

Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.

was making the "read my lips" promise...

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:59.840

like that just to get elected...

circumstances may overtake you.

Mr. Perot, the question is for you.

after Clinton did Baker?

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:51.452
He said, "That's what worries me."
Clinton said — the economic policy.

- Quick, before we, um —
- [Chattering]

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.084
Another good night for Bill Clinton.
Three debates, three wins.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.003
Bush was on the defensive all night long.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.089
I think he was put on the defensive
by Bill Clinton over the economy...

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.258
and by Ross Perot over Saddam Hussein...

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.886
and Ross Perot over the mess in Washington,
and he couldn't get out of it.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.681
It's the record. It's the agenda.
It's the qualifications.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:16.018
Governor Clinton and the Democrats
don't like when we talk about character...

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:19.188
but 54 of them thought
character was a very big issue...

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.608
when they rejected President Bush's
nominee for secretary of defense...

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:26.195
citing character insufficiencies
because he flirted with women in elevators.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:30.282
There's no doubt that George Bush's
attacks on us have an effect.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.952
The effect they're having
is on George Bush.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.036
Negative.

and hot dogs and rate these things.

Focus on the choice between
these candidates and their philosophies.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.477
And we have tried to do that
in each debate.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.897
We're not trying to create drama.
We are not a made-for-TV candidate.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:05.234
Yes, Governor Clinton won
on Geraldo-like activities.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:08.237
That's his shtick.
He's a performer. He's a phony.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:11.115
I mean, he walks into the audience.
He puts Geraldo to shame.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:14.660
That's not our gig. We are a leader.
We are mature.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.830
We have a breadth and depth of experience
that's unrivaled on that stage...

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.498
and that's all we've ever tried to do...

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:22.167
and have been very successful
in each of these debates doing...

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.838
and you'll all be eating crow, because that's
how the American voters look at this.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.173
They don't need another Geraldo.
They need a leader in the White House.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:31.135
- Here's ABC.
- Great.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.680

Hey, Trish, are you sure about this?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.310

I hope it was Perot.

I just got it from Ricki.

Great.

01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:49.278
[Trish] CBS is something like 35, Clinton,
29, Perot, and then the balance is Bush.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:50.821
I'm going to double-check that one.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.198
- Bush came in third in both.
- As far as I know.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.659
- One-third undecided, one-third weak.
- Right.

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:59.204
- That constitutes about 18% of the electorate.
- What was the other one-third?

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.625
Two-thirds were weak Clinton,
and one-third undecided.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.209
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:10.215

that was a strong showing for Perot.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.364
- Shakes you up, right?
- Huh?

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:47.615
Shakes you up.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.659
It was pretty hard, yeah.
I was pretty shaken up.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:54.080
Paulie, I got up this morning.
As I was driving to work, I started to cry.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:58.793
I couldn't keep it — I just can't —
I can't cope right now.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.548
Right.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:05.967
Man, I'm scared.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.680
Because we're all gonna have
to jump off a bridge.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:13.641
Because, you know —
Because of the last two days.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:17.729
Because of the last two days.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:18.813
Yeah.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:23.193
You know, it's kind of a mass thing.
We can all just drink some Kool-Aid.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.408
Okay, man. Have a good flight.
See you when you get in.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:31.910
Bye.

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.502
Hey, it's James.
What do you think?

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.755
[Woman On TV]
Dan Quayle came home to Indiana...

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.465
where he has never lost a race.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.509
You think it's gonna be tight
in NewJersey?

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:52.347
Why was everybody else
so optimistic earlier?

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:56.351
[Man] What was that mumbling
about seven points?

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:59.020
Oh, CBS. We dropped overnight.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.899
So now they're figuring out
how we can lose.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:05.610
- [Stephanopoulos Laughing]
- [Laughing, Scoffs]

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:09.155
I'm on the floor.
I'm literally on the floor.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.740
I can't take it.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:13.451
[Sighs]

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.372
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.709
We tried hard.
We came up a little short.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.463
- To those who embraced our crusade —
- [Stephanopoulos Laughs] Oh, God!

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.298
We say thank you.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.385
To President Bush, who's won reelection,
we offer our full support...

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:31.678
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, God.

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:34.222
- Our prayers and our hopes for a better America.
- Shut up.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.058
Throughout this campaign,
I've endeavored...

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.143
to bring my message
of change to the American people.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.979
[Bob] Where's Derek Humphry
when you need him?

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:43.106
[Carville] And over 42% of you people
embraced that message.

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.608
- I am grateful to each and every one of you.
- Are we in favor of assisted suicide?

01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:47.694
Hillary and I and Chelsea
will never forget you...

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:50.989
the way you welcomed us into your homes,
your towns and your cities.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.658
- [Chattering, Laughing]
- It is not that we...

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.120
have lost this battle,
it is whether we endure in a larger war.

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.913
[Laughing]

01:21:58.998 --> 01:22:03.001
In a stunning come-from-behind upset
that shocked pundits...

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:07.088
political professionals, journalists,
people around the world...

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:10.008
- George Herbert Walker Bush —
- Was reelected today.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.261
Proved his political resiliency
beyond any doubt whatsoever...

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:15.847
and was reelected today over Bill Clinton...

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.223
[Phone Ringing]

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:21.686
Garnering 274 electoral votes,
only four over.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.189
But as they say, it's not horseshoes
and it's not hand grenades.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.400
And George Bush will return —

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:31.446
We repeat, George Bush will return
to the White House for another four years.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:36.075
- [Man] And what's the other one?
- Florida is now 42, Bush, 41.5, Clinton.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.703
- That's what we're getting, so —
- It's started then.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:41.456
- [All Talking At Once]
- You know what that means.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.082
Uh —

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:48.796
Popkin talked to Warren, whatever,
the head of V.R. S...

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:52.383
and he's gonna talk to him in four minutes,
but his initial impression is it's a landslide.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.970
Could be up to 12,
maybe 400 electoral votes.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.390
[Laughs]

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.559
- What's this?
- We'll wait and see.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:04.145
- Holy shit.
- What's this? Is this the new one?

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.857
Arkansas.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.901
Connecticut's fine.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.403
- Delaware's fine. Georgia's good.
- Georg —

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.406
- Wait, wait, wait. Georgia, fine.
- Georgia's good.

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.408
Iowa's done.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.243
- Illinois is done.
- Illinois is a blowout.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.412
- [Both] Indiana, we're ahead.
- [Woman] Indiana?

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.414
- Kentucky —
- Kentucky is five.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:27.085
- Michigan is 11. New York's done.
- Holy shit. We're pulling away in Ohio.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:30.254
- Oklahoma, we're up.
- Tied in Texas.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:31.839
Tied in Texas.

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:35.593
It looks good.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:38.971
Now let's just say that...
I like the text here.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:41.099
Can you beep Wendy, please?

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:43.434
- Oh, you got it.
- [Whistles]

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:47.021
Looks pretty good.

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.815
Look at — Look at Indiana.
Wait, wait.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.775
- Look at Indiana, 42-40.
- I know.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:55.113
It doesn't matter if we win.
Those people are gonna shit. Oh, excuse me.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:58.783
[Stammers] In the White House,
how would you like to be —

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.702
[Whispering, Indistinct]

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.372
- [Whispering, Indistinct]
- Look at Texas. Go down to Texas.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.874
- Even.
- Yeah, 39-39.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.001
[Whispering, Indistinct]

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:11.045
- Perot's kind of holding, isn't he?
- [Stephanopoulos] He held.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:13.464
Yeah, he held. His numbers held.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:16.217
- I'm sort of surprised, frankly.
- This could be a landslide.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:17.927
Probably don't have anything yet.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.805
Let me — I gotta call Zell.
[Laughs]

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:23.641
[Stephanopoulos]
Goddamn.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:25.226
- [Woman, Indistinct]
- We up?

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.936
- Up seven.
- Oh.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.688
[Stephanopoulos]
This is very raw though.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:29.897
[Man]
You know what? Huh?

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.482
- [Stephanopoulos] Hello?
- Nothing.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:33.151
Is the governor there?

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:37.655
Um, well, if he wants to call,
tell him things look, um, outstanding.

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.782
Really good.

01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:42.118
[Carville]
Are you kidding me?

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.078
It's gotta be 10. Okay.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.915
- [Chattering]
- [Phone Ringing]

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.007
[Chattering, I ndistinct]

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:59.927
[Ringing Continues]

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.264
[Carville]
We don't have Louisiana anywhere?

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.433
[Man]
Okay.

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.435
[Second Phone Ringing]

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.942
[Carville] Well, who's got —
You don't have them all on your computer?

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.203
- This all tracks.
- Yeah.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.497
But if I call you at 3:00 my time...

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:30.124
you can look in your computer
and we can know everything.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.129
Like, when I try to say it,
it's gonna be hard.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:37.632
I don't know. What do you say?
Mr. President-Elect?

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:40.718
I think you gotta say Mr. — I assume
you just gotta say Mr. President.

01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:43.095
You say, "Congratulations,
Mr. President."

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.224
That's weird.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:52.647
This is the latest numbers at 2:00, okay?

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:56.734
California, we're up by 19.
Boxer's gonna win.

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:58.986
Colorado, we're up by 10.

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.905
[Ringing]

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.408
How long does he intend to talk?
This sounds like an awful long speech.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.160
[Man]
Oh, yeah. It'll be an hour or two.

01:26:06.245 --> 01:26:09.080
[Laughing]

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.249
[Greenberg] Can we go to the party
before he finishes?

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.543
Oh, yeah.
Okay, let me just run through this.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.586
- I think this is a pretty good structure.
- [Stephanopoulos] Okay.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:19.507
Third, which is the real
take-home point...

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:23.761
and I really sold on them,
which is this won't happen overnight.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:26.430
- Yeah, we gotta do that.
- That's the most important point to make.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:31.352
Yeah, I want a cold beer.
What kind of special today?

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:35.022
Well, the special today
is pepperoni and black olive.

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:38.943
And also we've got that 50-cent draft
Busch beer, if you want that.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.112
- [Laughing]
- No, I don't want Busch beer.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.614
Give me the —
Shit, I ain't drinking no Busch beer.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.366
Give me a Budweiser.

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.452
- [Laughing]
- Bud. And what would you like to eat?

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:52.498
Huh? I need a beer quickly.
Quickly, quickly.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:53.875
No Busch beer.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.544
Landslide.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:27:01.716
[Laughing]

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:06.053
[Cheering]

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.390
Pennsylvania!

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.399
The governor walks out — or president.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:21.402
[Chuckles]
God, I get shook up when I say it.

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:24.322
Walks out with Hillary and Chelsea.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:26.908
They wave, they smile, they hug.

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:30.995
The Gores —
He then introduces the Gores.

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:34.832
They wave, they smile, they hug.

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:37.376
The Gores go sit down.
Hillary and Chelsea go sit down.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.170
Governor gives his speech.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.840
I can't imagine the headlines tomorrow.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.258
I'm sorry?

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:46.761
The headlines tomorrow are gonna be —

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:56.187
We need — In that section, you've gotta
add a sentence about the young people.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.356
- And it would be nice to have the 83-year-old —
- What section?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.941
This section here.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:03.110
It's gotta be something specifically about
how young people voted...

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:06.113
- in record numbers and changed —
- In record numbers. With record enthusiasm.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:09.533
Their generation's gonna come —
It should come after the 83-year-old woman.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:12.411
See if we can find a story in the catalog
with a young person.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:20.795
[Exhales]

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:25.716
We gotta get him something real soon.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:28.302
These changes have to be made quickly.
We gotta get it right out to him.

01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:31.055
- How do I get it to him?
- We'll take care of it.

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:33.724
You like "everything"
better than "the country"?

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:34.809
[Man]
I'm sorry?

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.978
Do you like, "Together we can make the country
and love everything it was meant to be"...

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:39.981
better than "Together we can make the country
and love the country it was meant to be"?

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:43.401
That implies an inadequacy with the country,
doesn't it? The latter formulation?

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.069
Mm-hmm.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.446
That's nice. That's real nice.

01:28:47.531 --> 01:28:49.323
So just make that one change
and get it back.

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:50.574
Yes.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:54.912
- [Man On TV]... in Massachusetts.
- [Cheering]

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:57.999
- Thank you. Massachusetts.
- [Applause]

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:03.337
More, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more...

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:06.841
- more, more, more, more, more!
- [Cheering]

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.719
More, more!

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.554
All right! Are we gonna party?

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:14.765
[Chattering, I ndistinct]

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:16.600
[Shrieks]

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:22.773
You're ahead with comfortable margins
in the 10 largest states in the country...

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:25.276
and it's just, uh — it's —

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.070
Texas, the last time we checked,
you were two up.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:32.199
Thank you very much.
And now we've really got to do something.

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:33.784
Great. Bye-bye.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:40.291

Congratulations.

It's still not — You know, it's getting —
I mean, I was pretty shook up talking to him.

[Man]
What did he say?

01:29:53.472 --> 01:29:55.306
They were giddy. It's like it didn't —
I mean, they're just like —

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.308
Are you, like, happy
or are you scared...

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:01.812
or are you nothing or do you
want to just, like, cry or what?

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:04.398
The crying was before.
Maybe it'll be later too.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.901
No, it's just like... floating.

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.277
- James.
- What?

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.488
- On your chest in front of you —
- This one?

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:14.408
Your white one is totally unnecessary
because that beige one in your hand —

01:30:14.493 --> 01:30:16.494
Okay. This is the everywhere pass?

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:20.164
That is a very exclusive... There are only
about five of those in existence.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.333
- Okay.
- And it gets you backstage with the governor.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:25.336
- Where am I supposed to meet them? What room?
- There are only about five.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.254
- I-I-I —
- You don't know?

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:30.007
In the director's office of the State House.

01:30:30.092 --> 01:30:32.676
But it's almost impossible to get there
because there are so many...

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.762
tens of thousands of people
out on the street.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:37.431
I'll meet you out here.
I'm just going to use the ladies' room.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:39.850

gonna get there through the crowd.

I'm as happy as I can be
and I'm so proud.

We won Nevada big.

Governor, we're gonna —
I mean, it's looking like close to 400.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.088
It's a landslide.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:13.467
Ohio's not called yet.
North Carolina's not called yet.

But everything else —
I mean, Michigan —

Dead even in Florida.
You know, it's just unbelievable.

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:23.644
You oughta be the —
I mean, the happiest man in the world.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.856
And I just gotta tell you,
I just appreciate this so much.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.816
This was the best thing I ever did.

01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:34.572
We can try. He's up there talking now
though, you know.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:37.825
He's up there giving his speech. Yep.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:41.996
You don't?

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:45.082
But the one thing you gotta be —

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:47.543
We really want you to say
whatever you want to say tonight...

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:50.462
but you just gotta be careful
about being too programmatic.

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:54.258
You should definitely be New Democrat,
and we love Hillary's new patriotism thing...

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.260
which he tried to put in there.

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:59.430
Also you gotta do at the end,
he goes back to the announcement speech...

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.432
which is very important.

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.143
But you know, just say what —

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:06.770
Speak from your heart tonight.
I mean, that's all that matters.

What did he say when you said
"Mr. President"?

01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:36.967
