WEBVTT

00:34.768 --> 00:36.836
Can you tell me a story, Frank?

00:39.006 --> 00:41.074
Tell me something good.

00:41.408 --> 00:45.712
Make me the hero, or...
maybe I can get the girl.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.254
I got one.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.406
<i>A long time ago...</i>

01:12.407 --> 01:15.908
<i>you and me were fighter
pilots in the war.</i>

01:17.144 --> 01:19.280
<i>"The Flannigan brothers."</i>

01:20.882 --> 01:22.882
<i>We were famous.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:28.855
<i>One morning, we were heading over
to Germany when we got ambushed.</i>

01:29.157 --> 01:32.293
<i>You and me versus
20 German fighters.</i>

01:32.294 --> 01:35.361
<i>It was a mess. A real dogfight.</i>

01:35.463 --> 01:37.498
<i>It was touch and go
but we were winning,</i>

01:37.499 --> 01:41.634
<i>until a Nazi came out of the fog,
and started firing away at you.</i>

01:42.636 --> 01:46.106
<i>Luckily, I came down and
blew the son of a bitch up.</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:49.343
<i>"Thanks Tiger-Five"
you said over the radio.</i>

01:49.344 --> 01:52.846
<i>Problem was your plane was hit
and your controls were stuck.</i>

01:52.847 --> 01:57.117
<i>You were heading towards Iceland.
There was nothing you could do.</i>

01:57.118 --> 01:59.253
<i>You disappeared into the clouds.</i>

02:29.216 --> 02:30.550
Frank...

02:34.721 --> 02:36.389
Frank.

02:37.624 --> 02:38.724
Frank.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.726
What?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.696
Where are your clothes?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.333
- Something happened.
- What?

02:51.038 --> 02:53.974
I don't even wanna tell you, Frank.

02:53.975 --> 02:55.709
I don't understand why
this is happening...

02:55.710 --> 02:57.310
What happened?

03:00.547 --> 03:03.384
- Jesus Christ.
- What the fuck?

03:03.385 --> 03:05.418
We gotta go.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.821
I can't drive.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.934
I fell deep this time.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.370
Didn't I, Frank?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.639
I don't know.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.308
I don't know what happened.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.083
Polly Flynn got mad at me.

04:10.485 --> 04:14.321
She was yelling at me really hard.
So I went to go get dressed.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.387
She starts pointing a gun at me.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.493
She starts waving it around, pointing
it at me, so I grabbed it from her.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.097
Then she takes my pants.
She goes outside...

04:24.098 --> 04:25.732
and she lights 'em on fire
with lighter fluid.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.235
She's crazy, Frank.
She's fucking nuts.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.175
I got in the car.
I was driving home.

04:35.477 --> 04:38.479
Just driving down Fifth
Street, like always.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.347
And then...

04:40.348 --> 04:44.451
a kid... a kid comes out of nowhere,
on a bike in the middle of the road.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.220
And I hit him.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.360
So, I can't leave the kid
there, the poor kid.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.596
I gotta put him in the back seat and
take him to the hospital, right?

04:57.464 --> 04:59.432
Then when I went to pick him up...

05:04.505 --> 05:06.639
he was dead, Frank.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.807
I mean...

05:09.343 --> 05:12.144
It was the most horrible
thing I ever fucking seen.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.984
I drove a block from Saint Mary's

05:16.985 --> 05:20.486
I dropped him in the frozen grass
in front of the office building...

05:22.356 --> 05:24.457
And then I came to see you, Frank.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.612
I don't think we should
go back to Reno.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.382
<i>Now...</i>

05:50.684 --> 05:55.354
<i>There's an old wooden box in
my closet, behind my sweaters.</i>

05:55.822 --> 05:59.426
Inside the box is 500
dollars and my will.

06:00.328 --> 06:04.297
<i>The will gives you instructions
on what to do with my body,</i>

06:04.399 --> 06:09.001
how and where to pay the rent, title
to the car, that sort of thing.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.441
<i>Also, there's your dad's fancy gun.</i>

06:15.343 --> 06:19.545
<i>Don't let anybody fool you.
That gun's worth money.</i>

06:22.950 --> 06:25.618
<i>Now, if I can hang on...</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:30.022
<i>you'll soon both be old
enough to live on your own.</i>

06:32.559 --> 06:34.061
<i>But...</i>

06:34.062 --> 06:36.429
if I do die...

06:37.598 --> 06:39.965
they may try to split you up.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.038
Jerry Lee!

06:50.277 --> 06:51.911
No matter what...

06:52.779 --> 06:55.614
I want you two to stay together.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.826
Sorry.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.229
I really am, Frank.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.599
Let's go eat something.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.369
I don't feel like
being around anyone.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.608
I'm gonna get you some...
some soup or something.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.043
Alright.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.737
<i>One day you were feeling like shit,</i>

11:43.738 --> 11:47.840
<i>so you stole Dad's credit card and
drove to the Cotton Tail Ranch.</i>

11:47.942 --> 11:50.744
<i>You met this girl there, Candy.</i>

11:50.745 --> 11:54.648
<i>And in the course of a week you
spend 4,000 dollars on her.</i>

11:55.750 --> 11:59.886
<i>She was good. You made that
clear, she was damn good.</i>

11:59.887 --> 12:03.723
<i>You read her one of your stories
while she sat on her knees.</i>

12:03.724 --> 12:06.259
<i>When you were done, she told you
the hummer was on the house</i>

12:06.260 --> 12:08.127
<i>'cause your story was that good.</i>

12:09.362 --> 12:13.900
<i>You were on a roll so you got a room and
became a shut-in. A man on a mission.</i>

12:13.901 --> 12:17.903
<i>You didn't sleep for two days,
and wrote four stories.</i>

12:19.306 --> 12:23.810
<i>Th last one, your masterpiece, starred
Candy as a lonely Asian stripper.</i>

12:23.811 --> 12:27.313
<i>It was called "Hey Candy,
it's me Romeo".</i>

12:27.815 --> 12:32.718
<i>You decided to get some rest and see the
last frontiers, so you drove to Alaska.</i>

12:33.787 --> 12:35.755
<i>But it's colder than
shit in Alaska,</i>

12:35.756 --> 12:38.992
<i>and you started to feel guilty
about Dad and his credit card.</i>

12:38.993 --> 12:43.129
<i>So you drove back to Reno, and bought
a solid gold watch with diamonds,</i>

12:43.130 --> 12:46.433
<i>and gave it to him.
He didn't know what to think.</i>

12:46.434 --> 12:49.336
<i>A couple of days later he
got the credit card bill</i>

12:49.337 --> 12:52.973
<i>and the son of a bitch had you
committed to a mental hospital.</i>

12:52.974 --> 12:55.341
<i>But it sure beat working.</i>

12:55.743 --> 12:58.043
<i>You had all kinds of meds...</i>

12:58.778 --> 13:01.580
<i>and green grass as far
as the eye can see.</i>

13:02.449 --> 13:06.586
<i>And you didn't feel bad about Dad anymore
because that watch you gave him...</i>

13:06.988 --> 13:09.321
<i>was a nice fucking watch.</i>

13:14.861 --> 13:17.797
What the fuck were you
thinking, Jerry Lee?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.978
Frank, Frank!

13:31.979 --> 13:33.546
Hey Polly Flynn.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.948
Jesus, you were in there forever.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.985
Thanks for leaving the note.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.187
He said he didn't have the nerve
to shoot himself in the head.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.991
You know he stole my gun? My gun.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.961
What'd he do?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.798
Whatever it is,
I didn't do anything.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.694
<i>Frank...</i>

14:23.830 --> 14:25.597
<i>I'm doing really well.</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:29.201
<i>I've moved to Elko in
a small apartment.</i>

14:31.404 --> 14:32.906
<i>I still think about you.</i>

14:32.907 --> 14:36.041
- Do you think we'll see any bears?
- Maybe.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.678
Come on.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.349
<i>It would be really wonderful
to hear from you.</i>

14:43.350 --> 14:44.717
<i>But I understand.</i>

14:44.718 --> 14:47.019
- Who's place is it, again?
- I don't know.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.923
<i>Love, Annie.</i>

14:49.924 --> 14:53.125
Aah, whiskey.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.094
It's like they knew we were coming.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.400
I wish we lived here.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.306
I could make apple pie,
you could hunt deer.

15:06.307 --> 15:09.608
- You know how to make apple pie?
- No.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.544
It's okay.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.314
I don't think I could shoot a deer.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.818
Jerry Lee could even
have his own room.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.556
Or maybe you'll play
for the Yankees,

15:23.557 --> 15:28.495
and we'll come here to get away from
all your fans, and the reporters.

15:28.496 --> 15:30.829
Like a secret hide-out
or something.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.468
God, I wish we lived here.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.856
Hi. I'm getting a
check for Flannigan.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.960
Here you go.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.365
Flannigan!

16:07.133 --> 16:09.969
Where the hell've you been?
I had to hire someone else.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.205
I know, I just came by
to pick up my check.

16:12.206 --> 16:16.209
You should've called. You know, whatever
it was, maybe I could've helped.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.012
Yeah?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.349
Do you have a phone book?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.194
Say goodbye to Daddy.

17:10.314 --> 17:12.414
Look after your sister, all right?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.418
I can't go to jail, Frank.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.256
You're not gonna go to jail.

17:36.257 --> 17:39.092
Okay? Nobody knows
anything. We just lay low.

17:39.093 --> 17:42.795
If anyone finds out, if the
police or anyone finds out,

17:42.796 --> 17:46.932
- you gotta get me outta here.
- They ain't gonna find out.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.406
This TV's starting
to drive me crazy.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.579
That poor kid.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.120
You see Polly Flynn?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.589
I pretended like I was asleep.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.798
I ain't never been in love, Frank.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.771
Marge is the only
girl for me, I guess.

18:24.772 --> 18:27.105
And she's just a picture I draw.

18:29.142 --> 18:32.511
It sure don't feel like
love with Polly Flynn.

18:32.913 --> 18:35.447
If it does at all, it's
when we're fucking.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.484
Sometimes I feel like
I love her then.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.486
Never anytime else, though.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.924
But then...

18:44.925 --> 18:47.660
I used to feel that when I
used to fuck that fat old lady

18:47.661 --> 18:49.428
when we were staying
at the Silver State.

18:51.197 --> 18:56.169
Even then when I was about to let go,
I felt like I wanted to marry her.

18:57.805 --> 18:59.371
Here you go.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.107
Thanks.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.713
At least you've been
in love, Frank.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.553
I don't care what you say,
that girl really did like you.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.422
All she ever did was
talk about you.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.366
Hey.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.738
- You want one of these?
- Alright.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.342
- Hey Gary.
- Frank.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.689
I went by and I sat
with him yesterday.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.860
Seeing him there like that...

19:53.861 --> 19:57.329
it's hard not to think about the night
that you guys jumped the train.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.832
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that too.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.371
Why do you think he did it, Frank?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.275
I don't know much...

20:09.276 --> 20:12.678
but what worries me is you
guys just fucking split.

20:12.679 --> 20:17.049
- Did you at least cover it up at work?
- No. We just left, I was...

20:17.451 --> 20:21.187
drunk, and Jerry Lee was so
upset, he was out of his mind.

20:21.188 --> 20:23.289
But that looks bad.

20:23.290 --> 20:28.261
I mean, somebody starts asking around...
and now you're both fucked.

20:28.262 --> 20:29.427
I know.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.433
Why don't you ever come
down on him, Frank?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.973
'Ey.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.140
Come on.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.745
Luck of the Flannigans.
Almost worse than mine.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.417
Almost.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.656
Uh...

20:59.625 --> 21:02.861
Jerry Lee said you
owe him some money.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.398
Yeah, I do.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.436
Yeah, look, I owe him that
money and I'd pay you, Frank.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.306
I would pay you but...

21:13.307 --> 21:18.210
I've been betting the playoffs and I
fucking lost the last three weeks.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.414
I'm down a couple grand, man.

21:24.317 --> 21:28.287
I should've bet it on the Tyson Douglas
fight, that's what I should've done.

21:28.288 --> 21:32.091
Buster Douglas is gonna
win that fight, Frank.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.494
Christ, Tommy.

21:34.495 --> 21:37.330
Besides Jerry Lee, you're
the unluckiest guy I know.

21:37.331 --> 21:39.332
Don't you read the papers?

21:39.333 --> 21:43.802
Jesus, nobody thinks Buster Douglas is
gonna make it outta the first round.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.204
Hey guys.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.509
- Guess where I've been.
- I don't know, where ya been, Al?

21:49.510 --> 21:51.644
I've been in the loony bin.

21:51.645 --> 21:54.846
- Could I get a vodka cranberry?
- Sure, hon.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.883
Ugh, come on.

21:56.884 --> 22:02.554
I happened upon a bottle of liquid
acid. And I couldn't stop taking it.

22:02.856 --> 22:06.359
I ended up walking down Virginia.
Right down the center of town.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.529
All I was wearing was my
underwear and flip-flops.

22:09.530 --> 22:12.231
Luckily I'm still
half sane, though.

22:12.533 --> 22:17.336
They say they try to get you straight...
but they make you crazier than hell.

22:17.337 --> 22:20.105
I ain't never going back
to that place again.

22:20.407 --> 22:25.010
Don't get thrown in a mental hospital
Frank. It's worse than you think.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.340
It's alright, kid.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.978
- Are you alright?
- What?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.547
I said are you alright?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.587
- Hey Barry!
- Yeah, Dad?

23:07.588 --> 23:10.590
- We're gonna go grab a bite to eat.
- Okay.

23:10.591 --> 23:13.592
- Okay, just get me something.
- What do you want?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.027
I don't know, where're
you guys going?

23:15.028 --> 23:18.130
We're gonna eat the ass-end
out of a dead skunk.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.131
Get mine with ketchup!

23:20.633 --> 23:22.534
The boy's sick.

23:26.739 --> 23:30.076
<i>I'm sure sorry to hear
about your brother's leg.</i>

23:30.077 --> 23:33.646
<i>What, six months after
losing your mom?</i>

23:34.448 --> 23:37.716
And you're only what... sixteen?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.885
I just turned fifteen.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.888
I hired you when you were fourteen?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.556
Yeah.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.025
Jesus.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.361
Well, there you go.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.434
What were you thinking out there?

23:55.435 --> 23:58.603
I mean, when you were
just standing there.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.772
I don't know.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.609
Guess I was just... scared.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.078
I'd be scared too.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.448
Look, son...

24:09.449 --> 24:12.618
What you gotta do is think
about the life you want.

24:12.619 --> 24:17.657
Think about it in your head.
Make it a place you wanna be.

24:17.658 --> 24:21.293
A ranch, a beach house, penthouse,

24:21.294 --> 24:26.465
doesn't matter what it is, but a
place you can go hide out in.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.634
Then when everybody's on your ass,

24:28.635 --> 24:33.605
or you can't stop thinking about
your mom, you can go there.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.609
- Could it help my brother?
- I don't know.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.711
Tell him yours.

24:40.479 --> 24:45.551
I used to tell Barry stories all
the time when his life was rough.

24:45.552 --> 24:50.121
They seemed to help him out.
Gave him a place to escape to.

24:51.524 --> 24:56.194
Gave him some hope. Hope's the key.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.841
Hey, boy.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.082
What an asshole.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.152
Come on. Come on.

25:23.989 --> 25:28.094
<i>This is Mission Control at Houston,</i>

25:28.095 --> 25:32.764
<i>at three hours, two minutes
into the flight of Discovery.</i>

25:41.907 --> 25:43.776
It's hard to tell if
they're awake or not.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.712
You look better.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.747
I feel better.

25:50.716 --> 25:54.252
- Did they say anything about your leg?
- They ain't sure.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.658
Depends if they can stop some
sort of infection I got.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.695
At least I shot myself in the
leg that was already bad.

26:04.097 --> 26:05.563
Yeah.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.932
You're drunk, huh?

26:09.135 --> 26:10.468
Yeah.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.845
You should drink more milk, Frank.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.782
Hey.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.286
You find anything
out about the kid?

26:29.388 --> 26:33.092
Not much. His name was Wes Denny.

26:33.794 --> 26:36.262
He lived in a house, some
sorta foster place I think.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.131
I talked to a guy who
knew him. Said...

26:39.132 --> 26:41.667
his parents died in a car crash,

26:41.668 --> 26:44.837
and he'd been shuffled between
homes his whole life, you know.

26:44.838 --> 26:47.605
I mean, nobody really
gave a shit about him.

26:50.676 --> 26:51.943
For real?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.245
Yeah.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.882
- You ain't making it up?
- No.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.452
He was like us, you know.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.455
He didn't have anybody left.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.835
- I might have got us a dog.
- What?

27:20.639 --> 27:23.041
- No shit.
- Oh yeah.

27:23.676 --> 27:27.879
- Where... where'd you get it?
- Stole it from some guy's yard.

27:27.981 --> 27:33.052
I mean, he was gonna have frozen
to death if I hadn't, but...

27:33.053 --> 27:35.486
We always wanted a dog.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.723
Damn, that's something, huh?

27:39.859 --> 27:43.361
- Frank, that's really something.
- Yeah.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.899
<i>Frank?</i>

28:27.039 --> 28:29.041
Can we go somewhere else, Frank?

28:29.042 --> 28:30.776
What happened?

28:30.777 --> 28:32.910
- It's nothing.
- Here, sit down.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.118
Can we leave leave?

28:40.886 --> 28:43.789
Just stay here.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.124
You gotta get away from your mom.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.930
Can you at least just tell me a story
like the ones you tell Jerry Lee?

28:50.931 --> 28:52.798
Yeah.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.699
What do you want it to be about?

28:58.771 --> 29:02.642
Maybe it could be you
and me on an island...

29:03.944 --> 29:05.877
in the Pacific Ocean.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.980
With the sun.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.586
<i>And we could go
swimming all day long.</i>

29:14.788 --> 29:16.888
<i>And sleep on the beach.</i>

30:07.806 --> 30:10.009
I'm Officer Cook,
this is Officer Mori.

30:10.010 --> 30:12.710
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, okay?

30:14.013 --> 30:16.682
What kind of car do you
drive, Mr. Flannigan?

30:16.683 --> 30:18.015
It's a Chevy Caprice.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.021
- Where is your car?
- It was stolen.

30:22.022 --> 30:24.021
Why didn't you report it?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.657
It's a real piece of shit.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.495
It's been stolen a
few times before.

30:29.496 --> 30:34.165
Uh, we found your car, Mr. Flannigan.
It was burned and abandoned.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.635
Where was the car stolen from?

30:42.908 --> 30:47.413
Uh, The Sands... Sands parking lot.
I leave it there all the time.

30:47.414 --> 30:51.683
I live down... Rancho Sierra,
it's just right down the street.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.157
Are you aware that someone
might have been killed...

30:53.158 --> 30:55.821
by an old beat-up car like
yours in a hit-and-run?

30:55.822 --> 30:58.057
- No.
- A nurse getting off work...

30:58.058 --> 31:00.625
reported seeing a brown and grey
station wagon parked right outside.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.895
She said she saw someone moving
something out of the car

31:02.896 --> 31:06.030
- right where the body was found.
- What color's your car?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.065
It's brown and grey.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.904
Whoever stole it probably
did that, right?

31:11.905 --> 31:14.572
Why are you in the
hospital, Mr. Flannigan?

31:15.908 --> 31:18.277
- My leg...
- What happened to your leg?

31:18.278 --> 31:21.680
Please, I'm just tired,
I've had enough, okay?

31:21.681 --> 31:24.716
Can you just leave me alone,
just for a little bit?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.418
Doesn't look like
you're going anywhere.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.454
We have your room number
at the Rancho Sierra.

31:28.455 --> 31:30.054
We'll be back to see you soon.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.305
Fuck, Frank. What are we gonna do?

31:46.306 --> 31:48.907
We're not gonna do anything.
They don't know shit.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.776
They already know, I can tell.

31:50.777 --> 31:52.945
- They already know.
- No they don't. Okay?

31:52.946 --> 31:54.246
Thy don't know anything for sure.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.950
They will, they'll find out. You know that.
You gotta get me outta here, now.

31:57.951 --> 32:01.120
No. Okay, you gotta stay
here until you get better.

32:01.121 --> 32:05.890
I'm gonna go crazy if they come back.
Just get me outta here, Frank.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.043
What are you doing
with a Winchester?

32:25.345 --> 32:28.646
- What's he got there?
- His dad's rifle.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.083
What is it?

32:32.784 --> 32:37.121
It's a custom gold-plated
Winchester 1894...

32:41.126 --> 32:43.996
and I don't think this
thing's ever been fired.

32:43.997 --> 32:45.998
My brother and I never shot it.

32:45.999 --> 32:48.400
My mom said my dad got it on
one of his lucky streaks.

32:48.401 --> 32:52.171
I think he got it just
before he took off.

32:52.172 --> 32:54.439
Who'd he win it from?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.008
I'm not sure.

32:56.009 --> 32:57.976
I looked it up before.

32:57.977 --> 33:01.712
It ain't on any stolen list
that I've come across.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.985
- What're you gonna do with it?
- I was hoping you could buy it.

33:06.986 --> 33:10.556
I don't think I can give you the
kind of money this thing is worth.

33:10.557 --> 33:12.991
You should put a ad
up on Gun Trader,

33:12.992 --> 33:16.028
or wait until the next
gun show in March.

33:16.029 --> 33:17.561
I'm in a spot.

33:18.397 --> 33:23.001
All I could give you is 400. And
I don't recommend you take it.

33:23.002 --> 33:25.403
That's just all I could
give you for it.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.407
I'll take the 400.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.210
Okay.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.516
Tommy, get him some coffee.

33:38.218 --> 33:40.217
And make him take these donuts.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.059
You guys are leaving, aren't you?

33:48.061 --> 33:50.195
That's what you need the money for?

33:50.196 --> 33:51.996
I don't know.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.070
400 bucks ain't much to hit the
road with, if that's your plan.

33:58.071 --> 34:00.438
Yeah, I know. And we
don't even have a car.

34:01.773 --> 34:05.010
You can get a piece of shit
for 300, I don't know.

34:05.011 --> 34:08.580
I was thinking of going over to Earl
Hurley's lot, he'd set up credit with me.

34:08.581 --> 34:13.184
Yeah, you could do that.
I might have a better option.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.420
The Tyson Douglas fight.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.190
- I don't think so, Tommy.
- Hey.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.260
Frank, Frank! Come here.

34:24.463 --> 34:28.100
Listen, look, I know
this one's good.

34:28.101 --> 34:30.134
And... and... and I just...

34:31.103 --> 34:33.071
I just need help getting there.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.108
- I just need a little bit of money.
- Tommy.

34:36.109 --> 34:38.708
It's Jerry Lee, okay?

34:40.279 --> 34:45.117
Hey man, I'll give you my car.
The odds are 40 to 1.

34:45.118 --> 34:50.313
We bet 250 cash. Alright?
That means, worst case,

34:50.315 --> 34:54.483
you're walking out of there with at
least 150 bucks cash and my car.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.798
When's the fight?

35:01.133 --> 35:02.933
Tonight.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.306
I want the keys to your car.

35:07.307 --> 35:11.176
Right before we place the bet,
okay, I get the keys.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.844
- Deal?
- That's a deal, Frank.

35:14.846 --> 35:18.483
And don't tell Jerry Lee about
selling the old man's gun.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.320
My brother loved that asshole.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.305
Jesus, Al, what the
hell happened to you?

35:40.306 --> 35:42.541
You're not gonna fucking
believe it, Frank.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.878
Walking home last night,
after I rented a movie,

35:46.879 --> 35:49.181
a couple of those fucking
redneck bastards

35:49.182 --> 35:52.184
were waiting for me outside
that gay bar on Virginia.

35:52.185 --> 35:57.789
The one with the numbers on the outside.
Near the vegetarian joint, you know.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.359
A-a-anyway...

36:00.360 --> 36:04.329
they, uh, called me a queer,
they pushed me down, and, uh,

36:04.330 --> 36:07.366
kicked the shit outta me, man.

36:07.367 --> 36:10.668
I thought I was gonna die.
It was that bad.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.239
Finally I just curled up
into a cannonball,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.575
- and tried to wait it out, you know?
- Yeah.

36:16.576 --> 36:20.812
All 'cause I was walking by that place and
wearing my acid-washed jean jacket.

36:20.813 --> 36:23.215
- I mean, what the fuck?
- Jesus, let me see.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.715
It's just a jacket.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.752
Fuck, I didn't even know who
the fuck those guys were.

36:26.753 --> 36:29.086
I never seen them before
in my life, Frank.

36:30.756 --> 36:31.923
Hi.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.393
Gue-gue-guess what
movie I was renting.

36:34.394 --> 36:35.394
What?

36:35.395 --> 36:40.230
<i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i> for Christ's
sakes. <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!</i>

36:41.233 --> 36:44.236
It was a Saturday and I felt like
being in a good mood, you know?

36:44.237 --> 36:45.436
Yeah.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.339
Fuck, man.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.380
Shit, I remember one of
'em stole the movie.

36:55.381 --> 37:00.018
He-he-he-he picked it up and looked
at it, and then he just took it.

37:00.019 --> 37:03.388
- What kind of sick fuck steals a movie?
- Hey, Al...

37:03.389 --> 37:08.025
- your nose is... starting...
- Fuck. Ah, shit.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.802
Jesus Christ, I thought you
weren't gonna show up.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.772
- I told you I'd be here.
- Fight's starting in an hour.

37:20.773 --> 37:23.241
You're a crazy bastard
if you go through with it.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.277
Hey, shut the fuck up, Al.

37:25.278 --> 37:28.713
Heh, I wouldn't bet dead
dick on Buster Douglas.

37:28.714 --> 37:32.250
Hey, Frankie, don't listen to Al. Remember
he just got out of the loony bin.

37:32.275 --> 37:33.250
Yeah, you're fucking crazy.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.787
Buster Douglas is gonna
bust the shit out of him.

37:35.788 --> 37:37.255
No he ain't.

37:38.291 --> 37:39.724
Hey.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.927
<i>The Tyson Douglas fight
is about to begin.</i>

37:41.928 --> 37:44.729
<i>Please place your final bets
in the sports book upstairs.</i>

37:44.730 --> 37:48.332
<i>And good luck from your friends
at the Cal-Neva Casino.</i>

38:03.515 --> 38:05.684
250 on Douglas, please.

38:05.685 --> 38:10.322
<i>The undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world!</i>

38:10.323 --> 38:13.291
<i>Mike Tyson!</i>

38:16.495 --> 38:18.497
<i>We're almost 90 seconds
in and as yet,</i>

38:18.498 --> 38:21.933
<i>Tyson has done no real
damage to Buster Douglas.</i>

38:22.335 --> 38:26.371
<i>All that can change with one big
shot. It's always sudden death.</i>

38:28.974 --> 38:30.709
<i>That was a good round for Douglas.</i>

38:30.710 --> 38:33.178
<i>Probably the best round
I've ever seen him fight.</i>

38:33.179 --> 38:35.446
<i>Let's see if Douglas
can sustain it.</i>

38:37.482 --> 38:40.352
<i>Tyson seems less aggressive
than is normally the case,</i>

38:40.353 --> 38:42.653
<i>perhaps a little frustrated.</i>

38:42.855 --> 38:47.191
<i>This is totally uncharacteristic of
Mike Tyson. He's just... he's not on.</i>

38:47.493 --> 38:49.661
<i>That's a good right hand,
and a good right uppercut,</i>

38:49.662 --> 38:51.796
<i>and two good right
hooks by Douglas!</i>

38:51.797 --> 38:53.865
He got it, he got it,
he got it, he got it.

38:53.866 --> 38:55.734
<i>I don't think I've
seen Tyson absorb</i>

38:55.735 --> 38:59.337
<i>this kid of punishment ever
in his professional career.</i>

38:59.338 --> 39:02.807
<i>Another right hand and now
Tyson seems to be wobbling!</i>

39:02.808 --> 39:05.710
<i>Buster Douglas is completely
dominating this round!</i>

39:05.711 --> 39:07.978
Please move out of
the way, thank you.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.185
<i>And down goes Douglas!</i>

39:15.755 --> 39:17.856
<i>As suddenly as that!</i>

39:18.258 --> 39:21.062
- Fuck, fuck, fuck get up!
- I told you.

39:21.063 --> 39:23.561
Come on! Get up! Come on! Get up!

39:23.562 --> 39:27.231
<i>Tyson came off the ropes with
that terrific right uppercut.</i>

39:27.533 --> 39:30.001
Buster! I love you Buster!

39:30.002 --> 39:31.770
<i>Let's see what Mike
can do to finish.</i>

39:31.771 --> 39:36.340
<i>And the bell sounds to save Buster
Douglas at the end of round eight.</i>

39:38.410 --> 39:40.612
<i>Tyson needed something
like that desperately,</i>

39:40.613 --> 39:42.614
<i>to show the real
champion that he is.</i>

39:42.615 --> 39:46.717
<i>Let's see what Douglas can do when
he comes out for the next round.</i>

39:47.019 --> 39:49.554
<i>Clearly he was out on his
feet as the bell sounded.</i>

39:49.555 --> 39:52.557
<i>Oh! What a right hand by
Tyson to begin the tenth round!</i>

39:52.558 --> 39:54.392
<i>Douglas comes back with
a left and a right!</i>

39:54.393 --> 39:56.561
<i>Three solid shots,
right on Tyson's face!</i>

39:56.562 --> 39:58.463
<i>Douglas comes back with
a left and a right!</i>

39:58.464 --> 39:59.798
<i>Tyson is wobbling!</i>

39:59.799 --> 40:02.233
Oh! Oh! Oh!

40:03.235 --> 40:05.636
Holy shit! Holy shit!

40:22.554 --> 40:26.224
9,450.

40:26.225 --> 40:27.459
Holy fuck.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.427
That's more money
than I've ever had.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.797
- That's more money than I've ever seen.
- It barely fits in my wallet.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.598
Let's go to the strip club.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.601
Have fun, Al.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.839
Here.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.023
I was right, Frank.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.259
This time I was fucking right.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.094
You were.

41:42.366 --> 41:45.704
<i>I just don't want a minivan or
another fucking station wagon.</i>

41:45.705 --> 41:46.870
Okay.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.674
Hey, now that we've
got some dough...

41:49.675 --> 41:52.544
We'd probably be able to
find the kid's folks easier.

41:52.545 --> 41:55.680
<i>- They gotta be out there somewhere.</i>
- I don't think he's got anyone.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.917
<i>Frank, everybody's got
somebody, alright?</i>

41:58.918 --> 42:01.052
And if we find 'em we can
give 'em some of the money.

42:01.053 --> 42:03.720
<i>- What if I can't find 'em?
- You will.</i>

42:04.055 --> 42:05.690
<i>And when you do find 'em...</i>

42:05.691 --> 42:09.260
<i>maybe we'll get 'em some
subscriptions to magazines.</i>

42:09.562 --> 42:13.531
<i>Who knows what they like, but...
most people like magazines.</i>

42:13.532 --> 42:16.767
- I'll try.
<i>- Okay.</i>

42:37.889 --> 42:41.091
How the hell are you,
Frank Flannigan?

42:43.595 --> 42:47.965
What the hell are you doing out
there in this goddamned weather?

42:50.201 --> 42:54.304
I haven't seen you in a long fucking
time. It's been years, ain't it?

42:56.742 --> 43:00.711
- Well... I need a car, Earl.
- Today?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.750
It's goddamned Ice-land out there.

43:05.751 --> 43:08.986
Seems like a strange day
to be buying a car.

43:15.059 --> 43:18.563
Well, hell, kid, what kind
of car you want to buy?

43:18.564 --> 43:24.002
I got 1,500 to spend. I don't wanna
set up a payment plan or anything.

43:24.003 --> 43:26.803
I was hoping to just
pay cash on it.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.942
- You have anything in that ballpark?
- Well, I got a couple that might do ya.

43:32.244 --> 43:35.186
A 1985 Honda Civic.

43:35.520 --> 43:39.991
Maybe something bigger, Earl. Maybe
something you might be able to sleep in.

43:41.352 --> 43:45.089
Jesus, that's a horrible
fucking thought.

43:47.425 --> 43:50.694
I got a Dodge Dart
that Barry picked up.

43:52.630 --> 43:57.000
- Like the kind on the walls?
- Not that nice, but yeah, the same car.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.839
I'll take the Dart.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.607
I'll knock off a
couple a hundred...

44:03.709 --> 44:07.544
if you can go out there and
get it started yourself.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.898
Well, don't do anything stupid.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.067
Trying not to.

44:32.270 --> 44:34.571
You're not a loser, kid.

44:36.841 --> 44:40.778
But if you keep acting like
one, then I don't know.

44:41.080 --> 44:46.818
What I'm saying is... don't make
decisions thinking you're a low-life.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.255
Make decisions thinking
you're a great man.

44:51.357 --> 44:53.423
At least a good man.

44:54.859 --> 44:57.527
And don't be a goddamned pussy.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.831
Got a girlfriend?

45:02.734 --> 45:03.902
I used to.

45:03.903 --> 45:08.539
Well, there you go, see? Some
broad thinks you're alright.

45:16.914 --> 45:19.115
Take care of yourself.

46:59.984 --> 47:02.687
- Frank. Frank!
- What?

47:02.688 --> 47:04.455
Shit, Frank! Where the
fuck have you been?

47:04.456 --> 47:08.159
- What happened?
- Two cops were at my place.

47:25.510 --> 47:26.844
Jesus Christ, are we doing it?

47:26.845 --> 47:28.846
- Yeah, but we gotta go now.
- Alright.

47:28.847 --> 47:31.015
Get me my boot.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.480
Thanks for coming to get me, Frank.

47:44.896 --> 47:46.064
Ah!

47:46.065 --> 47:47.764
Alright, let's go.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.435
Come on, Frank.

47:50.436 --> 47:52.035
Excuse me, sir!

48:00.078 --> 48:02.880
- Where are we gonna go?
- Elko.

48:02.881 --> 48:05.549
- What's in Elko?
- I don't know.

48:09.088 --> 48:11.429
Yeah, this way.

48:11.923 --> 48:14.258
- Right there.
- No shit?

48:14.259 --> 48:16.294
- A Dodge Dart?
- Yeah, it runs good!

48:30.908 --> 48:34.044
Hola amigo! Hey!

49:02.973 --> 49:07.644
Cousin Harvey, you know, he was big.
Tall as a mountain, six foot five.

49:07.846 --> 49:11.281
Aunt Shea thinks he's a
gold mine. A pile of gold.

49:11.383 --> 49:15.118
She was so mean to him, eventually
he ran away, went to San Francisco.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.888
That's horrible.

49:21.692 --> 49:24.495
Wanna come out of the
blanket? Come on buddy.

49:24.496 --> 49:27.965
He gets beat up at every single game
he plays. Every single game.

49:27.966 --> 49:32.068
Ended up being some kind of
computer genius. A millionaire.

49:41.404 --> 49:43.771
Who's got my fucking key?

49:49.720 --> 49:52.155
Tell me about that one
about the pirates.

50:00.464 --> 50:02.265
Nice and warm?

50:08.739 --> 50:10.041
After Mom died...

50:11.043 --> 50:14.845
we left Reno and set
sail for Hawaii.

50:15.347 --> 50:19.716
<i>But on the way we got shanghaied
by a bunch of crazed pirates.</i>

50:20.018 --> 50:23.754
<i>The captain was a cross-dressing
homicidal maniac.</i>

50:23.755 --> 50:27.091
<i>Lethal with guns,
knives, and nunchakus.</i>

50:27.092 --> 50:30.228
<i>And the crew... they were
just a bunch of lunatics</i>

50:30.229 --> 50:32.763
<i>that the captain kept
addicted to morphine.</i>

50:32.764 --> 50:36.601
<i>We spent months trapped on
that ship. Working like slaves.</i>

50:36.602 --> 50:41.272
<i>Then, one night, Captain comes out
of his quarters in a yellow bikini.</i>

50:41.273 --> 50:45.710
<i>He does this amazing swan dive.
Like in the olympics.</i>

50:45.711 --> 50:48.278
<i>The crew all followed him in.</i>

50:48.580 --> 50:52.049
<i>You and me saw a school of
sharks around the boat.</i>

50:52.050 --> 50:54.250
<i>It was a real bloodbath.</i>

50:55.086 --> 50:58.822
<i>The sea was rough.
But you took control.</i>

50:59.024 --> 51:00.991
<i>You were a natural.</i>

51:03.228 --> 51:06.097
<i>We washed ashore on this island.</i>

51:06.098 --> 51:11.201
<i>We were nursed back to health
by this guy. Old Man Jenkins.</i>

51:11.803 --> 51:13.937
<i>He taught us how to shoot guns.</i>

51:14.539 --> 51:18.241
<i>And man, he looked just
like Willie Nelson.</i>

51:19.243 --> 51:21.244
<i>And the girls there,
they were beautiful.</i>

51:23.080 --> 51:25.148
<i>Turns out they thought
we were kings.</i>

51:26.083 --> 51:28.319
<i>So we decided to stay a while.</i>

52:10.294 --> 52:12.695
Man, it's a mess.

52:13.597 --> 52:15.298
Can we go?

52:16.167 --> 52:18.635
I just wanna get to
where we're going.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.473
Okay.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.760
I missed my Marge.

53:18.195 --> 53:21.999
I like the indian chopping the
cowboy's head off with the tomahawk.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.034
Yeah, that's a good one.

53:26.237 --> 53:29.673
I'm gonna go get something
to eat. What do you want?

53:29.674 --> 53:33.244
I ain't hungry. Sort
of thirsty, though.

53:33.245 --> 53:36.913
Get me some water?
Maybe some popsicles?

53:37.615 --> 53:38.948
Yeah.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.051
The three amigos.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.224
Be back soon.

54:02.706 --> 54:04.407
Oh, thanks

54:13.684 --> 54:16.452
- That's the girl.
- Oh yeah?

54:17.087 --> 54:19.455
The real bad-ass.

54:26.330 --> 54:28.665
- How was it?
- It was good.

55:08.339 --> 55:10.473
Who the fuck is that?

55:18.482 --> 55:20.050
<i>Hello?</i>

55:20.051 --> 55:21.451
Annie.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.896
- Hi Frank.
- Hello.

56:02.927 --> 56:04.961
I work at a bakery.

56:06.330 --> 56:07.897
It's a good job.

56:10.401 --> 56:13.571
I live in an apartment
not far from here.

56:13.572 --> 56:17.273
Smaller than any motel I've ever
stayed in, but it's pretty nice.

56:18.609 --> 56:21.583
I painted it.
It has a full kitchen.

56:21.609 --> 56:23.804
What color did you paint it?

56:26.550 --> 56:28.518
Um...

56:29.553 --> 56:32.856
The bathroom I painted white.
It was dark green.

56:32.857 --> 56:37.560
And the front room...
I painted a sorta cream color.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.229
Look's good.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.233
So, you guys on vacation?

56:45.369 --> 56:48.538
No. No, it's, uh...

56:48.939 --> 56:50.540
nothing like that.

56:51.475 --> 56:55.311
- You two ready to order?
- I'm too nervous to eat.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.617
I'll have a piece of
apple pie and coffee.

56:59.618 --> 57:00.616
You got it.

57:11.595 --> 57:15.631
I still think about you.
All the time, I do.

57:19.637 --> 57:21.637
I think about you too.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.440
I'm really glad you're here.

57:58.542 --> 57:59.776
Alright?

58:00.611 --> 58:03.279
I don't know how long I
can stand here, Frank.

58:03.481 --> 58:04.747
Okay.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.618
My hair smells pretty
fucking bad though.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.524
Shampoo.

58:13.525 --> 58:16.058
- Alright? Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.862
Yeah.

58:20.564 --> 58:26.102
- I'm fucking naked in front of you.
- That's okay. That's okay.

58:29.039 --> 58:31.241
You got a pretty big
dick, Jerry Lee.

58:31.242 --> 58:32.543
Thank you.

58:32.544 --> 58:37.548
Holy shit! Luck of the Flannigan's.
I think you got all that luck.

58:37.549 --> 58:39.915
Alright out your head under.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.222
Think I can rinse the back?

58:47.691 --> 58:50.858
- Okay. We'll get the back.
- Alright. Okay.

58:52.596 --> 58:55.033
Way back, a long time ago...

58:55.034 --> 58:59.236
our dad got a job a a
salesman at Used Car Magic.

58:59.738 --> 59:03.006
Aunt Bernie got him the job. She was
the aunt that used to give him...

59:03.007 --> 59:07.344
Penthouse, and Hustler, and
Playboy for slashing tires.

59:07.546 --> 59:11.548
Anyway... The lot was
owned by a guy named Ike,

59:11.549 --> 59:15.451
who was like old Earl Hurley,
but was a Jesus Freak.

59:15.553 --> 59:20.456
He drank and smoked and cheated on
his wife, but he also loved God.

59:22.292 --> 59:26.696
<i>One day, this bombshell Iris
walked onto the lot with Biff,</i>

59:27.198 --> 59:32.402
<i>a great dane Russian wolf hound
cross. She was looking for a Mustang.</i>

59:33.404 --> 59:36.140
<i>Dad went to get the keys
to the '64 convertible.</i>

59:36.141 --> 59:39.610
<i>He says to Ike, "the woman of
my dreams just walked in."</i>

59:39.611 --> 59:41.211
<i>Ike said, "remember:</i>

59:41.212 --> 59:44.881
<i>let the words trickle down your
tongue, like the fruits of Jesus."</i>

59:45.083 --> 59:48.619
<i>"You're cute." she said, and
moved her legs slightly apart.</i>

59:48.620 --> 59:50.853
<i>"Hell yeah" Dad thought.</i>

59:50.955 --> 59:54.323
<i>"Iris, I'm gonna blow your mind."</i>

59:55.659 --> 59:59.363
<i>They pull dover on a dirt road, and
Iris stood on the hood shooting lizards</i>

59:59.364 --> 01:00:04.734
<i>with her stainless steel Winchester
.357, while Dad ate fried chicken.</i>

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:10.640
<i>They did it on the hood, while Iris
shot the gun off over his head.</i>

01:00:12.644 --> 01:00:16.613
<i>Dad said it was the best
experience of his life.</i>

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:23.319
<i>Next thing he knows, they're stopped off
at Iris' house so she could shower.</i>

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:28.491
<i>Suddenly, the police broke in
and screamed, "Drug raid!"</i>

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:34.697
<i>They found a pound of weed, an M-16,
and a crate of Russian grenades.</i>

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:40.804
<i>Irish shouted, "Let him go! He's
just a man I found yesterday,</i>

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:45.909
<i>a man who would have changed my life, and
led me down the path to righteousness!"</i>

01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:50.214
<i>After only a week in jail, Iris was
stabbed five times in the neck,</i>

01:00:50.215 --> 01:00:52.815
<i>while getting a
prison-issued haircut.</i>

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:57.353
<i>Dad was sad as hell, 'cause
he really loved Iris.</i>

01:00:57.855 --> 01:01:01.859
<i>It was a hard time, until one
day, about a year later,</i>

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.494
<i>our mother walked
onto the dusty lot.</i>

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:09.933
<i>Ike took Dad aside.
"Jimmy," he said,</i>

01:01:10.235 --> 01:01:13.369
<i>"I think this might be
the next gal for you."</i>

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:18.674
Then he gave him a hundred buck bonus,
and the rest of the day off. The end.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.613
That's a hell of a story, Frank.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:29.118
That damn woman, she
was something, huh?

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.122
I liked the part about fucking
and shooting the gun off.

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:35.893
It's too bad Iris had to die.

01:01:35.894 --> 01:01:39.695
But then he wouldn't have met
Mom, and... we wouldn't be here.

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:44.299
I didn't want her to, but...
she just did.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.055
You know...

01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:50.197
a lot of the stories you tell,
the cool girl dies at the end.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.912
I mean, that one about the
parachute didn't open for her.

01:01:54.913 --> 01:01:57.680
Then the girl got
caught on the rocks.

01:01:57.882 --> 01:02:01.551
She ran outta air in her SCUBA
tank before we could get to her.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.287
And then there were
those sand people,

01:02:03.288 --> 01:02:06.622
or whatever they were...
they tortured her to death.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:10.226
Yeah.

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.297
It's good that we're here.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:20.803
I'm gonna sleep to that story.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.408
Let's not talk anymore.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.077
I don't wanna lose it.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.735
This is where I work.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.405
Seems like a nice place.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:01.143
Are you gonna stay
here for a while?

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:18.829
- Annie James, holy shit!
- Hi Jerry Lee.

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:23.033
I knew there was a reason
we came to Elko. I just...

01:03:23.034 --> 01:03:26.702
- I couldn't figure it out.
- It's good to see you.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.371
I told her everything.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.042
Yeah?

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.979
I guess it doesn't really matter.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:42.518
I just wish it was me instead
of that kid, Annie. I do.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:47.223
No, don't say that. What
would Frank do without you?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:58.000
Anyway, you guys, you should
go have some fun, huh?

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.026
You gotta walk her
home anyway, Frank.

01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:02.005
No, he's gotta stay
and keep you company.

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:06.075
No, we're good, right?
We're pretty good here.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.258
Annie James.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.027
We gotta clean that.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:31.902
Aah!

01:04:31.903 --> 01:04:33.203
Alright.

01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:34.436
Fuck!

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.106
Fuck.

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.085
- Thanks.
- Yep. Over here.

01:04:48.086 --> 01:04:49.952
Hey boy. Hey.

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.945
Hi.

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:20.049
This is it.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.091
Why are you here, Frank?

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.161
To see you.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:11.600
- And to know that you're okay.
- I am.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:16.705
Yeah.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.977
So what now?

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.882
I don't know.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.691
I know that I hurt you.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:39.962
Yeah.

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.502
I know, yeah.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.508
I'm sorry.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.032
I'm sorry.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.569
I don't care.

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:24.239
I hated doing that. What
you saw, I really did.

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.176
She made me do it.

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.714
She went on and on about all
the things she's done for me.

01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:32.826
And how that guy you saw
was gonna kill her.

01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:34.984
And he really did say he
was gonna kill her.

01:07:35.086 --> 01:07:38.688
You should go. I'll walk you out.

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:43.059
I can't lose you, Frank. Really I can't.
I can't go back there. No, please!

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.229
Frank, please!

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.299
Frank!

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.212
Frank.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.149
- Hey Frank, wake up.
- What time is it?

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:08.189
I don't know, all I know
is I gotta take a leak,

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:10.211
and I don't think I
can get up by myself.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.154
Alright.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:18.295
Well, come on, Frank.
I'm about to piss myself.

01:08:18.296 --> 01:08:20.929
If I do, I'm taking your bed.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.036
Ah, the greatest
feeling I've ever had.

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:39.915
I think this is the longest piss
I think I've ever pissed, Frank.

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:44.185
- I'm gonna be sick soon.
- I'm almost done.

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.328
Frank.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.305
Maybe you should just
drink beer from now on.

01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:06.343
I mean it looked like you
drank half that bottle.

01:09:06.344 --> 01:09:10.312
You know Willie Nelson, he said whiskey was
the only thing that almost killed him.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:14.783
More than any other drug, and I'm
sure he tried them all, you know...

01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.586
Sure he has.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.304
How ya feeling?

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.875
I'm having nightmares.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.383
Mind if I have one of those?

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.569
We drank a lot of beers.

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.340
Didn't we, Frank?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:14.276
Yeah, I guess so.

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:22.784
Hey, that probably ain't
too good for you.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.596
It can't be that bad.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:42.938
So, you think you
could live in Elko?

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:48.410
I think it could be pretty
nice, you know, it's, uh...

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:51.281
it's different.

01:10:51.282 --> 01:10:55.250
- You gonna start seeing her again?
- I don't know.

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.989
You still ain't ever
told me what happened.

01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:03.659
Yeah, well you probably wouldn't
like her too much if you knew.

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:08.297
I think I have a pretty
good idea, though.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.403
You ever tell anyone?

01:11:15.328 --> 01:11:16.575
No.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.976
You never talk about
anything, Frank.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.647
I know you better than anybody.

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:30.018
I don't even know what
you're thinking anymore.

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:35.424
It doesn't have to
be me, I guess...

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:38.927
It's just not good
to hold things in.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.365
If you read the Willie
book, you'd know that.

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:02.951
I went down to the
Sutro that night.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.390
And uh... saw her like that.
With some guy.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.960
And uh... with her...

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:19.135
down to her bottom underwear with
her bare knees on that old carpet.

01:12:19.537 --> 01:12:22.704
With her mom in the... in the room.

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:28.977
Well, she's had a hard life.

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.415
I mean, her mom's a
hooker for chrissakes.

01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:36.719
I keep... seeing her knees
in my mind, you know?

01:12:36.921 --> 01:12:39.187
We're fuck-ups, Frank.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.558
We're gonna be with
people who are fuck-ups.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.096
And to me...

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:51.366
to me that makes sense.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.508
You're the loneliest
guy I know, Frank.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:05.180
Everyone says that.
Even Tommy says that.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.223
- All I've ever done is fuck up.
- Don't say that.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:20.062
Oh come on. I ain't never had a woman
tell me that she loved me. You have.

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:23.632
Annie told you that, didn't she?

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:28.904
- Yeah.
- See?

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.243
- I ain't never done anything.
- We're just getting started.

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.610
Maybe.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.652
No girl's gonna fuck a guy with
one leg. A guy who's killed a kid.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.990
Now, I'm just telling
you the truth.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:54.062
I'm just telling you the truth.

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:03.171
I made you something.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.184
I drew this for you.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.692
Oh, man.

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.630
That's funnier than hell.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.701
Hey.

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:37.639
You're a good man, Frank Flannigan.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:40.308
You are.

01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:46.314
I love you.

01:15:20.584 --> 01:15:24.554
<i>You were heading towards Iceland
and there was nothing you could do.</i>

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.933
<i>Your plane crashes into
a goddamned blizzard.</i>

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:47.709
<i>You're almost snow-blind, when a polar bear
the size of an elephant starts chasing you.</i>

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:50.780
<i>You pull out your pearl-handled .45</i>

01:15:50.781 --> 01:15:54.683
<i>and out one round right through
it's brain, killing it dead.</i>

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:03.226
You take out your Air
Force issue pocket knife

01:16:03.227 --> 01:16:06.928
and carve up a hole in the
polar bear, and jump inside.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.535
<i>You walk all night, and in the
morning you come across a cabin,</i>

01:16:12.536 --> 01:16:18.107
<i>and hear a girl screaming inside. She's
naked, tied face down on the bed.</i>

01:16:18.108 --> 01:16:20.643
<i>An old guy with a whip
stands over her,</i>

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:24.614
<i>and goddamn if he isn't doing a
line of cocaine off her ass.</i>

01:16:24.615 --> 01:16:29.152
<i>A line the size of a deer antler. You
kick in the door, pull out your gun,</i>

01:16:29.153 --> 01:16:34.689
<i>and say, "Sir, I am a lieutenant in the
American Air Force. Put down that whip."</i>

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:38.761
<i>Then the girl comes flying out and stabs
him in the throat with a kitchen knife,</i>

01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:43.732
<i>and blood squirts everywhere. And
you leave his body to the wolves.</i>

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:49.772
<i>Her name's Marge. She tells you you're
the greatest man she's ever met.</i>

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:52.608
<i>You end up falling in love.</i>

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:55.978
<i>Goddamn if a meteor doesn't
come flying from the sky</i>

01:16:55.979 --> 01:17:01.483
<i>and crash right next to your cabin. Oil
starts shooting out 100 years high.</i>

01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:06.821
- What's going on?
- Sir, please move back.

01:17:09.826 --> 01:17:13.663
"Honey" you ask her,
"you own this land?"

01:17:13.664 --> 01:17:17.466
"No, we own this land."
She says and hugs you.

01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:21.970
"Goddamn." you say.
"We're gonna be millionaires."
