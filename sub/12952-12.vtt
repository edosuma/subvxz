00:00.967 --> 00:02.234
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:04.863
Sydney can no longer be
your primary concern.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.372
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

00:06.373 --> 00:08.873
If you care about
my daughter as you claim to,

00:08.875 --> 00:10.576
make her despise you,

00:10.577 --> 00:13.671
because your kindness
tortures her.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.899
Dixon, it's me.
I'm at the naval hospital.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.400
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

00:39.939 --> 00:42.439
The matter's taken care of.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.366
Three days ago,
the S.E.C. Flagged

02:14.367 --> 02:17.393
an offshore brokerage account
for a minor clerical violation.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.571
An investigation revealed
that the account

02:19.572 --> 02:21.406
was not backed
by any hard currency.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.641
A phantom account?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.910
Yes, and because
of its offshore status,

02:24.911 --> 02:27.411
it was turned over to Langley,
run through channels.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.715
Encoded in the names and values

02:29.716 --> 02:32.216
of the fictitious stocks
within the portfolio,

02:32.252 --> 02:33.785
cryptography found a message.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.346
Something the sender
wanted us to find.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.721
A Covenant official
wants to defect.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.727
What are the terms?

02:41.728 --> 02:44.163
In exchange for his extraction
and immunity, he's willing

02:44.164 --> 02:46.962
to turn over everything
he knows about The Covenant.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.298
Considering the means through
which he sent us this message,

02:50.370 --> 02:52.104
we believe he has
top-tier access

02:52.105 --> 02:53.672
inside the organization.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.574
Sydney, Vaughn.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.669
I'm sending you to North Korea

02:58.745 --> 03:01.475
posing as Swiss
insurance auditors.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.048
You'll meet with the defector
in the Gai-Li marketplace,

03:04.050 --> 03:05.884
1200 hours local.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.287
The identifying marker
will be three sugar cubes

03:08.288 --> 03:10.255
placed on a napkin
at the edge of the table.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.624
We've only got
a 15-minute window.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.293
15 minutes?

03:14.294 --> 03:15.727
Those were his terms.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.229
And he offered no contingency.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.730
If we don't show up at the meet,

03:18.731 --> 03:20.499
there's no assurance
that this opportunity

03:20.500 --> 03:21.867
will present itself again.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.936
If this defector can lead us

03:23.937 --> 03:25.537
to the inner workings
of The Covenant,

03:25.538 --> 03:27.406
we'll finally have them
on the ropes.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.907
Wheels up in four hours.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.577
Sydney.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.415
I was wondering if you have
any plans next Tuesday.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.583
It's Michael's hockey night,

03:37.584 --> 03:39.918
and I thought maybe
we could go out,

03:39.919 --> 03:41.620
get some dinner.

03:41.621 --> 03:44.146
Yeah, sure, that'd be nice.
Thanks.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.724
See you next Tuesday.

03:49.596 --> 03:54.158
So, The Covenant is in danger
of being compromised.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.301
This is of great concern to us.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.537
We'll send one of our own
in North Korea

03:58.538 --> 04:00.572
to intercept the defector.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.907
Do you know from which airfield

04:01.908 --> 04:03.909
Agents Bristow and Vaughn
will be departing?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.544
No, it wasn't mentioned.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.346
I need the name of the airfield

04:07.347 --> 04:10.578
in order to eliminate
Agents Vaughn and Bristow.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.210
The Covenant cannot accept
even the possibility

04:13.286 --> 04:16.255
of the CIA getting
their hands on a defector.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.695
Explain your hesitation.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.966
Give me 30 minutes.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.932
I'll get you
the information you need.

05:02.535 --> 05:03.802
Lauren.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.237
Do you have the number
for Giorgio's?

05:05.238 --> 05:06.705
I want to make a reservation.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.473
What were you doing?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.809
Asking Sydney to dinner?

05:10.810 --> 05:14.507
Michael, you asked me
to give her a chance.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.080
I'll drive you to the plane.
We can talk on the way.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.184
Well, I have to go get my stuff.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.385
Dover's five minutes
from the house.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.186
I'll drive myself.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.055
I don't want to start
socializing with Sydney.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.556
We see her enough as it is.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.526
Yeah, and for three months, it
was awkward and uncomfortable.

05:27.593 --> 05:31.188
At least if we get to know
each other, we can be civil.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.824
But I actually really like her.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.800
Is that really
such a big problem?

05:38.404 --> 05:40.904
No.
Of course not.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.408
Number's in my Rolodex.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.252
Be safe.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.088
Okay.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.532
Did you get it?

06:07.533 --> 06:10.033
Dover.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.738
In the next six hours,
a CIA fuselage

06:48.808 --> 06:50.742
carrying two operatives
will be downed

06:50.743 --> 06:53.243
at The Covenant's behest.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.677
You are being deployed
to North Korea

06:56.749 --> 07:00.207
in order to procure
a Covenant defector.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.917
If I may ask, who is our source
of intel at the CIA,

07:03.990 --> 07:06.490
and how do we know
he's reliable?

07:06.526 --> 07:11.225
Mr. Sark, don't burden yourself
with unnecessary details.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.862
As my liaison to The Covenant,
Mr. Zisman,

07:16.936 --> 07:19.564
I must say you're a great
disappointment to me.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.006
You seem to be forgetting
one rather large detail.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.772
That would be the $800 million
of my money

07:26.846 --> 07:29.508
used to fund this organization.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.050
An organization
that's proven to be

07:32.051 --> 07:35.214
ineffective, disorganized,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.289
and if you'll allow me
to be petty,

07:37.290 --> 07:40.316
disrespectful
to its benefactors.

07:40.893 --> 07:45.159
Shall I convey your sentiments
to my superiors?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.731
If you wish.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.836
You will go to North Korea.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.805
Is that understood?

07:55.074 --> 07:57.574
Yes, sir.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.904
What are you reading?

08:28.474 --> 08:30.974
Calvino.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.111
Have you reviewed the file?

08:34.113 --> 08:36.613
Of course I reviewed the file.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.897
Okay.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.967
This isn't going to work.

08:55.968 --> 08:58.493
- What isn't?
- What have I done to you?

08:58.571 --> 09:00.572
Nothing.
I don't have a problem.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.140
Have I offended you
in some way?

09:02.141 --> 09:03.808
By doing what, coming back?

09:03.809 --> 09:06.835
Disrupting the perfect life
you had going on?

09:06.913 --> 09:08.280
I'm just sitting here
reading a book.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.314
I haven't said anything.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.182
You haven't said anything
in weeks.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.884
We're supposed to be
working together.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.286
If you want to work
with someone else,

09:14.287 --> 09:15.587
we can make a switch.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.988
I've done everything I can

09:16.989 --> 09:19.057
to make this
ridiculous situation work.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.026
You, me, and Lauren
working in the same office.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.621
I have tried to walk around
with this fake smile

09:23.696 --> 09:26.221
pretending everything was fine
just the way it used to be.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.799
That's not working for me
anymore.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.038
This is it.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.539
When we get back,
one of us has to go.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.389
He's dead.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.890
So is he.

10:10.176 --> 10:13.236
We're in North Korean airspace.
We have to abort.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.473
Vaughn, we have incoming!

10:31.197 --> 10:33.697
It's still locked on.
It's turning back.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.305
There's another one!

10:51.717 --> 10:53.752
They're both locked on!
I'm gonna flame us out!

10:53.753 --> 10:54.886
We need the engines to land!

10:54.887 --> 10:56.588
They're heat-seekers.
That's the only way.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.089
I'm shutting off the engines.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.282
Fire up the air start ignition.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.051
A.S.I. On.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.552
It's not working!

11:32.458 --> 11:34.893
1,500 feet.
1,000 feet.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.394
We don't have enough juice
for a restart. Hang on!

11:45.638 --> 11:47.105
Vaughn!

11:47.106 --> 11:49.606
Vaughn!

12:45.030 --> 12:46.865
Where the hell
is the State Department?

12:46.866 --> 12:48.533
Sir, I've got D.O.D.
On line one.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.034
What can you tell me?

12:51.971 --> 12:53.538
Marshall, what's happening?

12:53.539 --> 12:55.039
Oh.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.565
There's been...

12:57.977 --> 13:00.477
Agent Bristow?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.782
What's going on?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.050
Sydney and Vaughn's jet
was intercepted

13:06.051 --> 13:08.052
by surface-to-air missiles
over North Korea.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.288
Their condition is unknown.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.623
Who was responsible?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.958
Early Echelon reports indicate
the North Korean government

13:13.959 --> 13:15.393
was not responsible.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.162
Therefore, we suspect
The Covenant.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.330
If they survived,
the North Korean military

13:19.331 --> 13:20.598
will be hunting them.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.193
We're attempting to monitor
through satellite.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.703
When information comes in,
you'll be the first to know.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.672
Thank you.

13:27.673 --> 13:31.734
What Vaughn and Sydney need now
is our strength.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.444
Jack, Lauren, my office.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.017
I've just been informed
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff

13:41.020 --> 13:43.716
that we've been ordered
to stand down.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.858
Given our tenuous relations
with North Korea,

13:46.859 --> 13:49.194
their official position
on Sydney and Vaughn

13:49.195 --> 13:51.695
is to disavow.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.804
Unofficially, I say screw them.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.740
Pool your resources.

14:02.741 --> 14:06.302
We don't rest until Sydney and
Vaughn are back in our hands.

15:14.179 --> 15:16.014
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.982
4- Alpha-Delta.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.851
Do you copy?

15:19.852 --> 15:22.582
Base Ops, do you copy?

15:22.955 --> 15:25.023
- Anything?
- Comms are dead. You?

15:25.024 --> 15:28.460
No. Can't get to the artillery.
Their cargo door's jammed.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.194
What's your best guess
on our coordinates?

15:30.195 --> 15:33.596
We can't be more than 40 minutes
southwest of our L.Z.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.468
What happened?

15:37.469 --> 15:39.969
I'm fine.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.307
Okay.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.208
We have eight hours
until our meet,

15:44.209 --> 15:46.709
which means on foot,
we're gonna miss our window.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.847
That's military.

16:22.281 --> 16:25.079
They're 100 meters out.
We got to move.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.288
This is Jack.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.556
I heard about Sydney.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.924
Has there been any word?

17:39.925 --> 17:41.325
Nothing yet.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.660
Well, then let me help.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.096
Omnifam has strong ties
to the premier of China.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.631
Thank you.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.132
If I need your help,
I'll let you know.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.776
I think we're clear.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.445
Yeah, for now.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.946
Let me see.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.664
Ow.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.165
That's for being a jerk
on the plane.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.170
Thanks.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.309
We've got seven hours to get
to the Gai-Li marketplace.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.810
We need to find transportation.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.782
What?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.283
Nothing.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.474
Jack Bristow.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.645
Your daughter is alive.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.171
So is Agent Vaughn.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.387
Do you mind if I ask
who you are?

19:16.388 --> 19:19.221
What you should ask
is what I need you to do

19:19.291 --> 19:21.559
in return for my assistance.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.694
I was going to get to that.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.763
I will do everything in my power

19:25.764 --> 19:28.232
to guarantee the safe return
of your daughter

19:28.233 --> 19:30.733
and her associate.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.270
But I need something from you.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.109
I need you to kill Arvin Sloane.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.424
Lauren.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.759
Jack just called.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.260
Vaughn and Sydney are alive.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.530
Where are they?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.625
He didn't say, but he's
orchestrating an exit strategy.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.966
Well, that...
Thank you!

20:14.546 --> 20:15.713
Nothing.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.808
We'll have a better chance
once we get to Gai-Li.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.618
Vaughn.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.132
The tires still have air.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.968
Still some gas.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.036
- How's it look?
- I don't know.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.537
Pull me some wiring
out of the dashboard.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.079
Thanks.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.580
It could still take a charge.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.583
Spin the generator pulley.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.282
We've got a heartbeat.
Keep it spinning.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.224
We have to generate enough
charge to spark the engine.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.926
Listen, earlier, on the plane.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.499
It's okay.

21:10.869 --> 21:14.305
It's the only thing
I could ever count on.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.440
The way it felt to be with you.
How easy it was.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.941
That's all gone now.

21:18.977 --> 21:21.412
How are we supposed
to get along and be friends?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.913
You're right.
It's ridiculous.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.487
I slept with Will.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.822
What?

21:31.823 --> 21:34.225
In Warsaw.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.626
We got drunk.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.127
And we slept together.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.826
How am I supposed to react
to that?

21:44.202 --> 21:46.702
However you want to.

21:50.742 --> 21:53.010
Bad enough being a fugitive
in North Korea.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.511
Now I have to find out
you slept with Will?

21:59.351 --> 22:02.787
I want you to know
that I'm moving on.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.222
Not with Will.

22:05.223 --> 22:08.420
Just generally.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.697
If it helps.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.405
All right,
that should be enough.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.040
Yeah, you're probably right.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.710
Okay.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.232
Your operative in North Korea
should be advised

22:49.234 --> 22:51.734
that Agents Bristow and Vaughn
are still in play.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.501
- How is that possible?
- That's what I'd like to know.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.269
Particularly as I jeopardize
my standing within the CIA

22:57.342 --> 22:58.776
for an offensive which failed.

22:58.777 --> 23:01.371
I'll pass the news along.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.029
Mr. Cho, please.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.531
We're closed.

23:20.532 --> 23:24.263
The black sparrow seeks
an audience with Mr. Cho.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.671
Yes.
I'll let him know.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.540
I prefer to remain unannounced.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.041
We shall not be disturbed.

23:33.779 --> 23:38.148
Mr. Cho, I apologize
for disturbing your meal.

23:38.216 --> 23:40.878
An unexpected delight.

23:40.952 --> 23:43.421
I was under the impression
that you were never returning

23:43.422 --> 23:45.922
to the United States.

23:46.658 --> 23:49.158
Sit.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.331
This is not a social call.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.832
You have a debt to pay.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.503
Yes.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.038
I'm aware.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.441
I need an extraction.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.009
From Q-Gong province.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.510
Two Americans.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.149
No, I'm sorry.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.846
That's more than even I can do.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.323
Aah!

24:21.560 --> 24:24.060
This is not a negotiation.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.636
The repercussions.
They're too dangerous for me.

24:37.709 --> 24:40.209
Aah!

24:40.378 --> 24:44.314
I am not concerned
of the repercussions.

24:44.382 --> 24:46.050
Yes.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.551
Yes, I'll call Kwan.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.077
Mr. Kwan can help us.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.592
Everything you need to know.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.329
Don't fail me.

25:03.902 --> 25:06.402
We'll be in touch.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.545
I've never been this on time
in my life.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.050
There he is.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.824
Let's go.

26:00.825 --> 26:03.325
Wait.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.874
Mister...

26:16.875 --> 26:18.475
I'm sorry.

26:18.476 --> 26:20.144
You forgot to give us your name.

26:20.145 --> 26:22.645
You first.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.015
I'm Agent Hollier.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.516
I'm with the CIA.

26:28.486 --> 26:29.853
We have to get in there now.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.354
Any move we make,
Sark kills him.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.325
Not necessarily.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.293
Which field office of the CIA

26:36.294 --> 26:38.462
did you say you were from,
Mr. Hollier?

26:38.463 --> 26:40.963
Portland office.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.533
I have a car waiting,

26:42.534 --> 26:44.768
and a plane fueled up
ready to go.

26:44.769 --> 26:49.035
You are on your way to becoming
a God-blessed American citizen.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.943
Gloria Estefan.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.847
What about her?

26:56.848 --> 26:59.408
I like her.

26:59.484 --> 27:04.888
Four years, The Covenant has
had me here in North Korea.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.224
This culture has no...

27:09.594 --> 27:11.495
pep.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.097
America, though.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.531
Lots of pep.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.166
Well, I assure you,

27:16.167 --> 27:18.692
the United States
will be happy to have you.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.339
Yes.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.840
The Covenant must be stopped.

27:25.744 --> 27:28.770
What they are planning
keeps me awake at night,

27:28.847 --> 27:30.681
not sleeping.

27:30.682 --> 27:34.812
My friend, tonight you'll sleep
very soundly.

27:38.857 --> 27:39.923
Stay calm.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.392
Nobody move.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.360
What is this?

27:43.361 --> 27:45.262
Listen very closely.
This man is not CIA.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.330
He's Covenant.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.731
Covenant?

27:47.732 --> 27:48.966
We're CIA.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.201
This was huge mistake.

27:51.202 --> 27:52.503
You have to trust us.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.004
Vaughn.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.943
I believe their Army

27:59.944 --> 28:02.444
is in search of fugitives
from a downed airplane.

28:02.447 --> 28:04.381
Suspected CIA.

28:04.382 --> 28:07.408
Look, let's make this
easy for each other.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.386
Leonid and I are going
to walk out of here.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.355
Sydney is going to keep
the knife where it is

28:11.356 --> 28:12.656
until we are clear.

28:12.657 --> 28:14.091
Once we are, she will follow us.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.526
If you stick to that plan,

28:15.527 --> 28:17.494
you might still have
children one day.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.329
Except the execution
of your threat

28:19.330 --> 28:21.958
would tip off our friends
over there.

28:24.102 --> 28:26.730
It seems everyone has
something to lose.

28:26.805 --> 28:29.603
Everyone, except for me.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.174
Goodbye.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.839
It's not deep.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.807
- But the liver...
- I know.

29:03.808 --> 29:07.471
I'll need you to check
if the tissue's intact.

29:07.545 --> 29:08.746
Tell me.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.247
Which of Irina's sisters
are you?

29:12.951 --> 29:15.647
Yelena or Yekaterina?

29:20.825 --> 29:24.454
I haven't been Yekaterina
since I was a child.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.225
My sisters call me Katya,

29:27.298 --> 29:30.961
which means Irina wasn't the one
who told you about me.

29:31.569 --> 29:34.069
Learning that your wife
is actually a Russian spy

29:34.105 --> 29:38.337
drives you to learn all you can
about her true identity.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.845
The tissue is stable.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.355
As observant as you are,

29:51.356 --> 29:53.690
you were married
to my sister for five years

29:53.691 --> 29:57.593
without suspecting
who she really was.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.761
Her love must have been
intoxicating.

30:04.335 --> 30:08.465
Mr. Kwan will see that Sydney
will return home safely.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.876
Now you have something
to do for me.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.550
And what do you
possibly have to gain

30:19.551 --> 30:22.051
from my executing Arvin Sloane?

30:23.922 --> 30:26.422
And why me?

30:28.459 --> 30:32.361
I consider the assassination
a preventative measure.

30:32.430 --> 30:34.930
And why you?

30:35.233 --> 30:37.733
It's not for you to ask.

30:37.735 --> 30:40.170
We had an agreement.

30:40.171 --> 30:44.437
You choose not to deliver,
I call off Mr. Kwan.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.076
CIA.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.346
They're CIA.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.847
I will talk.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.384
Thank you.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.377
Vaughn.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.717
Sydney, come here.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.218
Come here, Sydney.

33:00.244 --> 33:03.771
Jack Bristow.
I have a 3:00 with Arvin Sloane.

33:05.583 --> 33:09.075
Sir, Jack Bristow's here
to see you.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.229
Arvin Sloane, please.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.730
You have a call on line one.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.234
Yes?

33:24.235 --> 33:26.735
Arvin?

33:27.538 --> 33:30.038
I assume you know who this is.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.244
I do.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.712
I have a message for you.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.682
Back off Irina.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.619
I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to take that.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.255
Listen to me carefully.

33:45.256 --> 33:47.756
No matter how protected
you think you are,

33:47.759 --> 33:49.593
you are not.

33:49.594 --> 33:52.119
Even from your friends.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.298
Even the one
you are about to see.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.726
Your continuing life
is a favor...

33:59.804 --> 34:02.329
from me.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.713
This is Jack.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.748
Change of plan.
I need you to abort.

34:11.748 --> 34:14.309
I'll explain later.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.146
Mr. Bristow, he'll see you now.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.467
Tell me, Jack.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.835
Did you reconsider
my offer to help Sydney?

34:34.371 --> 34:37.466
I just wanted to let you know
I think we're making progress.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.743
That's good.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.713
So you've extracted
Sydney from North Korea?

34:42.780 --> 34:45.181
I'm working on it.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.551
I was able to contact
someone on the inside

34:47.552 --> 34:50.052
who could help us.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.387
And you came all the way
to Zurich to tell me this?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.027
No.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.862
I had a meeting locally,

34:58.863 --> 35:02.128
but I wanted to drop in,
tell you in person.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.601
You've done a lot
for Sydney lately.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.903
I felt I owed you the courtesy.

35:06.904 --> 35:09.404
I see.

35:09.874 --> 35:12.374
Thank you.

35:14.045 --> 35:17.537
I remember years ago,

35:17.615 --> 35:20.115
I was working at SD-6.

35:21.619 --> 35:25.316
I was on my way
to a meeting in Berlin.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.889
It was a typical day,

35:27.892 --> 35:30.952
except K-Directorate
made an attempt on my life.

35:31.028 --> 35:32.696
As I opened the car door,

35:32.697 --> 35:34.831
a sniper shot
came out of nowhere.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.133
Bullet grazed my neck.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.634
Actually left a burn mark.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.205
You never forget
what that feels like.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.903
To barely escape
with your life.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.444
I have a plane waiting.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.020
Then you should go.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.030
We're not going to make it
out of here.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.465
There's something
I need you to know.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.042
Vaughn.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.543
In my life...

36:22.079 --> 36:24.548
...there is only one person.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.882
Don't do this.

36:25.883 --> 36:28.383
Look at me.

36:29.053 --> 36:30.787
Vaughn.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.389
The only reason
I pushed you away...

36:32.390 --> 36:33.890
Please.

36:33.891 --> 36:37.827
The only reason is I didn't know
how to be around you.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.063
They're coming.

36:40.064 --> 36:42.564
Sydney.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.168
I know, Vaughn.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.704
I know.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.343
We'll find each other.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.972
We always find each other.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.647
I'm Mr. Kwan.
I'm here to help you.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.161
What is happening?

38:55.266 --> 38:57.766
I'm sorry for the things
I have...

39:01.172 --> 39:02.672
Thank you.

39:02.673 --> 39:06.803
Before, I hope you did not think
I was betraying you in any way.

39:06.877 --> 39:09.377
What I was trying to do was...

39:10.848 --> 39:13.348
Thank you.

39:34.038 --> 39:38.839
<i># We might kiss #</i>

39:39.710 --> 39:43.043
<i># When we are alone #</i>

39:46.517 --> 39:50.146
<i># When nobody's watching #</i>

39:50.221 --> 39:53.156
<i># I might take you home #</i>

39:58.729 --> 40:03.223
<i># We might make out #</i>

40:04.735 --> 40:08.398
<i># When nobody's there #</i>

40:11.075 --> 40:14.169
<i># It's not that we're scared #</i>

40:14.245 --> 40:18.306
<i># It's just that
it's delicate #</i>

40:20.651 --> 40:27.523
<i># So why'd you fill
my sorrow #</i>

40:27.591 --> 40:33.689
<i># With the words you borrow #</i>

40:33.764 --> 40:39.703
<i># From the only place #</i>

40:39.770 --> 40:44.036
<i># You've known? #</i>

40:44.108 --> 40:46.142
- So sorry. Excuse me.
- That's okay.

40:46.143 --> 40:53.640
<i># And why'd you sing
hallelujah? #</i>

40:53.717 --> 40:55.718
How did you find me?

40:55.719 --> 40:59.086
Your mother found you.

40:59.156 --> 41:01.784
<i># Why'd you sing #</i>

41:01.859 --> 41:05.192
<i># With me #</i>

41:05.262 --> 41:08.390
<i># At all? #</i>

41:16.140 --> 41:18.734
You warned him, didn't you?

41:18.809 --> 41:20.243
Sloane.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.412
Whatever trust
I'd established with him

41:22.413 --> 41:24.881
over the last three months
has been compromised.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.916
What I can't figure out is,

41:26.917 --> 41:30.353
how will this play
to Irina's advantage?

41:30.421 --> 41:32.921
Or your own?

41:33.924 --> 41:36.125
One day
when you least expect it,

41:36.126 --> 41:39.357
Irina's intentions will
present themselves to you.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.598
And when that day comes,
I promise you,

41:41.599 --> 41:44.591
it will be unmistakable.

41:47.638 --> 41:50.138
Thank you for helping Sydney.

41:51.242 --> 41:54.075
Isn't that what family's for?

41:57.781 --> 42:00.281
That was from Irina.

42:02.386 --> 42:09.656
<i># So why'd you fill
my sorrow #</i>

42:09.727 --> 42:15.165
<i># With the words
you borrow... #</i>

42:15.232 --> 42:17.732
And who was that from?

42:18.235 --> 42:21.204
Too many questions.

42:21.272 --> 42:25.436
<i>#... that you've known? #</i>

42:27.811 --> 42:33.909
<i># And why'd you sing
hallelujah? #</i>

42:34.305 --> 42:40.869
