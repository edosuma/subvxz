00:56.501 --> 00:57.501
Thanks.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.360
Sorry I'm late.

00:59.863 --> 01:01.364
Ray's friends are here.

01:01.489 --> 01:03.930
He didn't tell me
they were coming over.

01:04.055 --> 01:06.255
Michelle, Lisa, this is Jonathan.

01:10.161 --> 01:11.152
Where's Ray?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.377
He's in the bathroom masturbating.

01:14.068 --> 01:15.783
- What?
- I'm almost done.

01:15.908 --> 01:17.442
Just three more times.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.537
Why is he doing that?

01:19.943 --> 01:22.319
Ray and Leah
are being really generous with us

01:22.444 --> 01:25.001
and Ray is giving us his sperm
so that we can have a baby.

01:25.429 --> 01:27.260
Tonight's our first exchange.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.089
- But I'm not the one being generous.
- I think you are.

01:30.610 --> 01:33.968
Sharing your lover's sperm with us
is very kind of you.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.555
Yeah, and we really need this stuff.
There's no getting around it.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.080
And what my Michelle wants,
she gets.

01:41.696 --> 01:43.918
Yeah, Ray told me about this.

01:44.281 --> 01:46.004
Well, congratulations.

01:46.129 --> 01:49.050
As long as a kid isn't born with a beard
we'll be happy.

01:49.175 --> 01:52.055
Stop. No, actually we just
really love Ray's comics

01:52.180 --> 01:54.697
and we're hoping that the baby
will become an artist.

01:55.354 --> 01:58.409
And what do you do, in case
we want a different kind of baby?

01:59.419 --> 02:00.594
I heard that.

02:02.238 --> 02:04.123
- Really, what do you do?
- I'm a writer.

02:04.871 --> 02:08.043
And Ray told me you're moonlighting
as a private detective.

02:08.824 --> 02:12.423
Maybe you could help a friend of mine.
Her son's skateboard was stolen.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.175
I could definitely look into that.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.250
So far I've solved all my cases.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.095
I mean, there've only been two,

02:18.324 --> 02:20.056
but still, that's a perfect record.

02:20.225 --> 02:23.320
Okay, well, her name is Alice
and she's a radical vegan.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.062
I know a lot of radical vegans.
She must be unhappy.

02:34.176 --> 02:35.258
All that jizz.

02:36.549 --> 02:39.293
But could you put that in the fridge?
'cause we need to keep it chilled.

02:39.418 --> 02:42.462
No, I don't want it in the fridge.
The girls' lunches are in there.

02:42.587 --> 02:44.205
- Leah, please.
- All right.

02:46.028 --> 02:48.478
I'll put it in the sink
with some ice.

02:50.765 --> 02:54.110
Just give it to me, Leah.
We'll put it in our cooler.

02:57.479 --> 02:59.553
- Oh my god.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.714
Here it is. Here it is.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.979
- Okay, good. No spillage.
- We should go.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.479
For the record, I'm against this.

03:14.190 --> 03:17.138
I'm sorry to bring this up,
but could I have your friend's number...

03:17.263 --> 03:18.663
The radical vegan?

03:19.062 --> 03:20.754
I really want that case.

03:21.749 --> 03:22.999
Ray, the sperm.

03:23.698 --> 03:25.178
More?
Oh, this.

03:27.947 --> 03:29.216
Goodbye, Picasso.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.800
I never skateboarded myself.

03:38.065 --> 03:40.727
My parents wouldn't let me.
They were kind of...

03:40.852 --> 03:42.411
overprotective and smothering.

03:42.586 --> 03:44.168
I'm a very permissive parent.

03:44.293 --> 03:47.404
I think it's really important
that David have a sense of agency.

03:47.529 --> 03:51.313
Like every night for dinner
he decides what he wants to eat.

03:51.791 --> 03:53.735
He must eat a lot of pizza then.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.110
We don't eat dairy or wheat.

03:57.629 --> 03:59.780
David has a lot of food allergies.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.352
I don't know if Leah told you,
but I advocated the public schools

04:02.477 --> 04:04.869
for slow food and raw food
and live food.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.455
In my heart I'm a vegan,
but in my mouth I lack discipline.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.941
It sounds like your heart's
in the right place.

04:11.066 --> 04:12.793
You just have to work on your mouth.

04:14.972 --> 04:17.947
So what exactly happened
with David's skatebo...?

04:20.406 --> 04:21.757
It's gonna stain.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.131
So what exactly happened
with David's skateboard?

04:26.256 --> 04:28.051
Well, this older boy,

04:28.226 --> 04:30.565
this alpha-male bully took it.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.148
I offered to buy a new
one, but he wouldn't hear of it.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.149
He's very attached to this one.

04:35.392 --> 04:37.359
- How old is David?
- He's nine.

04:37.892 --> 04:41.896
- And the boy who took his skateboard?
- I don't know. He's, like, 16 or 17.

04:42.603 --> 04:44.308
His name is Francisco.

04:44.713 --> 04:47.563
I can't get it back.
It would humiliate David.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.413
That's really very smart of you.

04:49.719 --> 04:52.082
When I was a kid I had back spasms

04:52.313 --> 04:54.467
and I went to this crazy orthopedist

04:54.592 --> 04:56.629
who prescribed a corset.
For months...

04:56.797 --> 04:59.964
- Do you still have back problems?
- Sometimes. It's...

05:00.134 --> 05:01.347
I can fix that.

05:02.156 --> 05:03.556
Lie on your belly.

05:08.345 --> 05:09.266
A corset?

05:09.950 --> 05:11.294
I think that's odd.

05:11.419 --> 05:14.236
I don't know if I'd let a doctor
do that to David.

05:14.361 --> 05:18.179
Yeah, it was a very Victorian cure,
especially for New Jersey.

05:18.304 --> 05:20.310
But the point of my story was

05:20.520 --> 05:22.446
that my mother
never let anyone know.

05:22.806 --> 05:24.156
She protected me.

05:24.513 --> 05:26.431
I only wore sweatshirts.

05:26.668 --> 05:28.619
I'm glad to hear that part.
Roll over.

05:37.051 --> 05:38.251
How's that?

05:38.770 --> 05:39.770
Wonderful.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.329
Copy me.

05:48.142 --> 05:49.492
Lift your leg up.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.125
Do you really think you can
get David's skateboard back?

05:54.947 --> 05:56.203
I'll get it back

05:56.328 --> 05:58.188
and I'll find this Francisco.

05:58.313 --> 05:59.513
The other leg.

06:00.622 --> 06:02.171
I'd be really grateful.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.504
Ever since David's father
and I broke up...

06:06.243 --> 06:08.843
I've been without a man
around the house.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.047
You've got a man in the house now.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.243
I'm looking for a kid named Francisco.
Do you know him?

06:33.368 --> 06:35.936
He rides around on the board
that looks like this.

06:36.761 --> 06:38.816
Do you... Do you know...
Do you know Fran...

06:38.941 --> 06:40.232
Do you know Francisco?

07:03.985 --> 07:04.965
Excuse me.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.933
Do you know someone named Francisco?

07:11.058 --> 07:12.858
Ever skateboarded with him

07:13.191 --> 07:14.433
on the streets?

07:15.714 --> 07:16.642
I know him.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.937
Do you know where
he likes to skateboard?

07:19.282 --> 07:20.272
Don't remember.

07:24.022 --> 07:25.778
Would $5 help your memory?

07:26.251 --> 07:27.875
No, but $10 would.

07:28.727 --> 07:30.277
All right, tough guy.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.244
Excuse me one second...
Business.

07:36.270 --> 07:38.832
- Caroline.
- <i>Jonathan, there you are.</i>

07:39.051 --> 07:41.772
How's it coming with the new
Kama sutra novel?

07:41.922 --> 07:43.337
What position are you on?

07:43.505 --> 07:46.204
I'm on chapter 11... Chapter 12...

07:46.329 --> 07:47.853
- Position 12.
- That's...

07:48.314 --> 07:50.591
52 positions to go.

07:50.855 --> 07:53.440
Listen, you keep working
hard, all right?

07:53.565 --> 07:56.183
And, you know, send me a
chapter now if you like.

07:56.351 --> 08:00.073
I'll send you something soon, okay?
But I am with a friend right now,

08:00.198 --> 08:02.314
so I'll call you back.
Is that okay?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.316
<i>All right, sweetheart.
Don't be a stranger.</i>

08:04.609 --> 08:06.941
You know that all of my writers
are like my husbands.

08:07.066 --> 08:08.362
<i>Right, I know.
Okay.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:10.864
- Bye, Caroline.
- <i>Ciao, sweetie.</i>

08:19.475 --> 08:22.342
I think that you're not
working on the book

08:22.467 --> 08:24.344
because you're depressed
over losing the girl.

08:24.469 --> 08:27.369
I'm doing a little better.
I met someone today.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.287
That's perfect.
Hemingway, you know, said

08:30.412 --> 08:33.229
the best way to get over a woman
was to get another one.

08:33.354 --> 08:35.981
Of course then to get over that woman
you need another woman.

08:36.106 --> 08:39.308
So basically one failed relationship
leads to the next?

08:40.857 --> 08:43.063
Anyway, how's the new girl?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.298
Good-looking?

08:44.423 --> 08:47.144
Yeah, pretty sexy.
I really like her.

08:48.699 --> 08:49.699
Nice arms?

08:51.369 --> 08:53.449
I guess so, yeah.
Why?

08:53.935 --> 08:55.437
I don't know.
Just lately

08:55.562 --> 08:58.162
I've been going nuts
over women's arms...

09:00.154 --> 09:02.935
Actually the armpit.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.794
I just love it.

09:04.919 --> 09:08.377
It's this other secret place
to burrow into.

09:09.493 --> 09:12.330
But you don't have to slide as
far down the bed to get to it.

09:13.346 --> 09:15.387
Maybe it's laziness.
I don't know.

09:17.107 --> 09:19.206
There's also a childhood connection.

09:19.331 --> 09:22.019
Something happened with you
and an armpit in childhood?

09:23.390 --> 09:26.488
I was on the school bus.
I'm 11 years old.

09:26.889 --> 09:28.189
And this girl...

09:28.606 --> 09:30.152
Diane Trudy was her name...

09:30.679 --> 09:33.432
I remember she was wearing
a yellow dress.

09:33.719 --> 09:35.345
And when she stood up

09:35.470 --> 09:37.415
to reach for the pole

09:37.640 --> 09:40.100
the sunlight came
through the windshield

09:40.225 --> 09:41.830
and I could see her armpit.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.690
There were these beautiful,

09:45.481 --> 09:46.481
very slight

09:47.111 --> 09:48.561
blonde yellow hairs

09:49.446 --> 09:51.313
just sort of undulating.

09:53.893 --> 09:54.884
I fell in love.

09:55.369 --> 09:57.679
Why do you think the hairs
made you fall in love?

09:57.847 --> 10:00.515
Because I knew it meant
that she was becoming a woman.

10:01.248 --> 10:02.648
I like that story.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.186
And...

10:04.670 --> 10:05.995
God help me,

10:06.304 --> 10:07.753
it's happening again.

10:07.878 --> 10:09.097
Wait, what?

10:09.898 --> 10:12.823
I met this young publicist
the other day

10:12.948 --> 10:15.115
and for some reason
she lifted her arm

10:15.240 --> 10:17.326
and I could see these
light blonde hairs

10:17.451 --> 10:19.917
and it was like a moment
out of Proust...

10:20.042 --> 10:22.634
- I was back on the school bus.
- That's incredible.

10:22.759 --> 10:24.706
- So twice in one life.
- I know.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.245
Her name's Emily.

10:27.147 --> 10:30.650
She's the flack for a new hip restaurant
that's opening tomorrow

10:30.775 --> 10:32.725
out in Greenpoint, near you.

10:32.850 --> 10:34.977
- It's close by.
- You know what?

10:35.406 --> 10:37.979
They're having this tasting.
It starts around 5:00.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.138
It's all organic game...

10:40.497 --> 10:42.775
Rabbits that have been
shot naturally in the woods,

10:42.900 --> 10:44.977
that sort of thing.
Why don't you come with me?

10:45.379 --> 10:46.520
It'd be perfect.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.939
It's a very young crowd.
You could help me fit in.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.551
Hi, guys.

11:20.102 --> 11:21.703
I really like your board.

11:21.828 --> 11:23.327
I'm something of a collector.

11:23.452 --> 11:25.577
Is there any chance
you might want to sell it?

11:25.702 --> 11:27.854
Are you that dude
that's been asking about me?

11:27.979 --> 11:29.605
You from the school or something?

11:29.834 --> 11:33.148
No, I don't go to any school.
I haven't been asking about you, no.

11:33.273 --> 11:35.073
You sure?
'Cause some kids told me

11:35.198 --> 11:37.686
that a dude with a big nose
wanted to know where I hang out.

11:37.811 --> 11:38.821
That's not you?

11:38.990 --> 11:41.740
A dude with a big nose
is not me, my friend.

11:42.007 --> 11:44.715
No, it must be somebody else.
I'm just interested in your board.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.210
- Would you sell it for 20 bucks?
- Get out of here. I don't known you.

11:48.335 --> 11:50.618
I don't want to know you, all right?

11:51.290 --> 11:52.544
50 bucks?
How much?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.859
How about my fist in your face?
How about that?

11:55.049 --> 11:56.801
I don't think
I can afford that right now.

11:56.926 --> 11:59.581
So thank you very much
and keep on skatin'.

11:59.706 --> 12:00.706
All right.

12:05.908 --> 12:08.054
Can you get Leah's car and meet me?

12:10.687 --> 12:12.578
It's fun sitting here.
I still think

12:12.703 --> 12:15.002
it's weird to pretend that
you're a private detective.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.877
It's not pretending. Come on,
you're always drawing superheroes.

12:19.256 --> 12:20.781
This is your chance to be one.

12:21.318 --> 12:22.696
What is she paying us?

12:22.821 --> 12:24.910
Sorry, there's no money.
I'm doing this on <i>pro bono</i>.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.562
- I made out with her.
- What? Are you crazy?

12:28.687 --> 12:29.956
That girl's half nuts.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.750
I can't charge her now.
I'm taking her out for a drink tonight.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.740
Did she at least take her shirt off?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.332
No, we just made out,
but it was pretty amazing.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.593
We have chemistry
or something, I don't know.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.496
Maybe she could be my new Suzanne.
It is a little scary that she has a kid,

12:45.621 --> 12:47.906
but Leah has kids
and you have been together for a while.

12:48.031 --> 12:50.972
Yeah, but that is terrible.
Those kids pay me no respect.

12:51.097 --> 12:53.419
They call me fat and hairy.

12:53.792 --> 12:56.233
You know, they could lose
a few pounds themselves.

12:57.063 --> 12:59.486
Kids. I'm not cut out
to be a surrogate dad.

12:59.694 --> 13:01.841
But you're giving your sperm
to Lisa and Michelle.

13:01.966 --> 13:03.632
Because I don't have to do anything.

13:03.757 --> 13:06.785
I just signed a paper.
I have no rights as a father.

13:07.283 --> 13:09.204
- Why are you doing it then?
- I don't know.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.442
I was flattered.
But they're draining the hell out of me.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.626
They wanted four doses
in the last two days.

13:17.395 --> 13:19.168
Oh, shit.
Did you see that?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.426
Now he's gonna try that again
and he keeps screwing up.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.595
So this time I'm gonna run out
and grab that skateboard.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.397
While I'm doing that
take the car around to the corner

13:28.522 --> 13:30.325
and pick me up.
We'll make our getaway.

13:30.450 --> 13:31.851
You shouldn't do this.

13:31.976 --> 13:34.688
Kids like that used to beat you up
and I bet you they still can.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.810
There he goes.
Meet me on the corner.

13:46.267 --> 13:47.267
Fuck.

14:04.308 --> 14:06.386
Open up. Open the door.
Push the button.

14:06.603 --> 14:08.597
I'm opening it.
I'm hitting the button.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.047
Push the button.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.344
Go go.

14:12.172 --> 14:13.727
Open the door.

14:18.612 --> 14:19.732
Get back here!

14:44.759 --> 14:46.431
Come on, get in, get in.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.196
I was getting worried
you wouldn't show.

15:08.137 --> 15:10.158
- I'm sorry.
- Get in.

15:13.765 --> 15:16.982
Now what's with the skateboard?
I don't want you looking that young.

15:17.107 --> 15:20.380
I had to pick this up
for that woman that I met. I was...

15:20.505 --> 15:21.795
It's a long story.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.516
So what do you think?

15:23.641 --> 15:25.180
Is the outfit youthful?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.941
Well, a little...

15:28.310 --> 15:30.586
- The beret.
- Yeah, you're right.

15:32.068 --> 15:34.891
I have never seen you so nervous
about a woman before.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.546
I know. It's the first unabashed crush
I've had in years...

15:38.671 --> 15:40.502
She's bright, she's beautiful,

15:40.733 --> 15:42.427
the whole armpit madness.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.651
Do you have any dope?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.324
Steven, we're gonna smoke pot back here.
Is that all right with you?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.048
That's fine, Mr. Christopher.

15:54.993 --> 15:56.893
I'm very excited to see her.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.275
Do I smell like dope?

16:01.092 --> 16:04.587
I can't tell. I was in the car with you.
My nose is full of pot smell.

16:05.282 --> 16:06.673
Are we too stoned?

16:06.841 --> 16:09.761
My feet feel really
interesting in my shoes.

16:10.468 --> 16:11.594
We might be,

16:11.719 --> 16:13.792
but we'll get you a drink
and stabilize.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.597
George Christopher.

16:32.702 --> 16:34.434
God, these people are young.

16:34.559 --> 16:36.509
But this is exciting, right?

16:36.684 --> 16:39.434
Brooklyn's exciting.
It's the new Manhattan.

16:39.559 --> 16:41.166
I may have to move to Brooklyn.

16:41.608 --> 16:44.389
If Brooklyn is the new Manhattan,
what's Manhattan?

16:45.443 --> 16:47.466
Manhattan's the new Queens.

16:47.657 --> 16:50.507
And Queens is the new Brooklyn.

16:50.632 --> 16:52.594
And Brooklyn is...
Here she comes.

16:52.966 --> 16:55.860
Mr. Christopher,
what are you doing here?

16:56.574 --> 16:59.414
Truth is, I saw
a listing of your opening

16:59.539 --> 17:03.312
in the food section of my own magazine
and I thought I'd just pop in.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.316
Well, that's so nice of you.
Is your food writer here?

17:06.521 --> 17:08.647
Yes, Jonathan
is one of our best writers

17:08.772 --> 17:12.445
and he's going to cover the opening
and give it a big spread.

17:18.531 --> 17:21.330
Sorry, I'm a big hugger,
Mr. Christopher.

17:22.098 --> 17:24.625
- I do it when I get nervous.
- Hugs are good.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.915
I'd better go see how the chef's doing.
She's prepared an incredible

17:28.040 --> 17:31.233
slow-roasted polder
side farms organic pig

17:31.582 --> 17:34.296
that will be served
in a gribiche sauce

17:34.679 --> 17:37.847
and garnished with
wild pheasant egg yoke and seckel pears.

17:38.028 --> 17:39.639
God, that sounds amazing.

17:40.031 --> 17:42.018
I have a really profound hunger.

17:45.897 --> 17:48.024
Well, I think that went well enough.

17:49.857 --> 17:52.072
I don't think she could
tell we were stoned.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.797
Calling me "Mr. Christopher"
is not that promising,

17:54.922 --> 17:57.820
but the hug...
The hug was a good sign, right?

17:57.945 --> 18:00.286
I mean, women don't touch
you if they don't like you.

18:01.071 --> 18:02.397
She seemed great.

18:03.327 --> 18:05.287
Maybe Emily would show us
the kitchen.

18:05.412 --> 18:09.231
 It wouldn't be a bad idea for us
to know where the fire exits are, right?

18:10.145 --> 18:11.595
Here comes the pig.

18:25.848 --> 18:27.981
When I was 13 years old

18:28.170 --> 18:29.733
I first had foie gras

18:29.901 --> 18:32.777
and it absolutely transported me
to another dimension.

18:38.734 --> 18:42.020
And since then it has been my dream

18:42.265 --> 18:44.914
to make food that would
change your life.

18:45.114 --> 18:46.040
So...

18:49.587 --> 18:51.637
That's 'cause of you, big nose.

19:02.229 --> 19:03.329
To the chef.

19:14.392 --> 19:17.042
George, I'm so sorry.
I'm really so sorry.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.499
What exactly happened back there?

19:19.624 --> 19:21.148
I mean, who were those kids?

19:21.273 --> 19:23.963
Well, they're just some kids
from my neighborhood.

19:24.088 --> 19:26.594
And it's kind of a long story,

19:26.719 --> 19:30.310
but in a nutshell, they don't like me
and they pick on me.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.408
You're 30 years old, Jonathan.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.784
I know. Is there anything I can do
to make this up to you?

19:34.909 --> 19:38.603
- I'm so sorry that Emily is upset.
- I'm dropping the whole Emily thing.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.375
I can't date a woman 30 years
younger than myself.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.102
What the hell was I thinking?

19:43.227 --> 19:45.058
20 years is a good cutoff.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.358
- That's more reasonable.
- Very reasonable.

19:47.483 --> 19:50.063
- Or 25. That's not bad either.
- 25 also good, George.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.572
- Get in.
- Okay.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.288
Could you drop me off somewhere?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.664
I got David's skateboard back.

20:09.215 --> 20:11.751
And we're going for a drink, right?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.499
No, I can't.
I'm sorry.

20:13.624 --> 20:15.477
David is having terrible allergies.

20:15.602 --> 20:17.841
He ate some gluten at school today

20:18.009 --> 20:21.052
and his wrists are definitely
a little bit swollen.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.430
And I think I should tell you

20:24.598 --> 20:27.897
that David is not comfortable
with me dating anyone just yet.

20:28.022 --> 20:31.192
And we're a team.
We're a beautiful unit.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.020
I don't want to upset him.

20:36.423 --> 20:37.905
But thank you for this.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.989
I hope it wasn't too hard.
David will be thrilled.

20:41.736 --> 20:42.850
You're welcome.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.118
I really have to put
some ice on his wrists.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.936
Maybe in a few weeks...

20:51.894 --> 20:53.094
I'll call you.

21:06.740 --> 21:07.891
Hey, big nose!
