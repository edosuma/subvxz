WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:03.960
- <i>Previously on "The Ark..."</i>
- I'’m putting you
under house arrest.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.571
Felix, that'’s not me
in the video.
I didn'’t kill anyone.

00:06.571 --> 00:09.357
- How'’s that not you?
- Her name'’s Denise.
We were clones.

00:09.357 --> 00:13.143
<i>Then they introduced
additional experimental DNA
into our systems.</i>

00:13.143 --> 00:16.886
I completed the genetic trials
and was assigned to this ark
to see if it all worked.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.453
I'’ve been having
strange visions as well.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.063
I talk a lot when I'’m nervous.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.370
I told you,
you don'’t have to be nervous.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.938
- You'’re wasting time
with this boy.
- Uh...

00:25.938 --> 00:28.376
Lieutenant Lane.
Keep an eye on that one.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.856
We'’re gonna end up with no food
and everyone will blame me.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.162
Maybe they need
some more water.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.338
- It'’s the water! The comet.
- What?

00:34.338 --> 00:36.645
I'’ve been drinking the water
just as long as everyone else,

00:36.645 --> 00:40.127
but I'’ve had no hallucinations.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.781
This just gets
better and better.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.609
She synthesized this sample
to be hydrophilic.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.916
We need to put whatever'’s
in this vial into the water

00:46.916 --> 00:47.786
and that'’s gonna cure us all.

00:53.401 --> 00:58.232
We need you to analyze it,
see if you can use it to figure
out exactly what hit the ship.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.016
- It could'’ve been a weapon.
- We'’re only the people

01:00.016 --> 01:01.365
in history
to go this far in space.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.366
I didn'’t say people.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.424
Oh, my God.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.305
Dr. Kabir.

01:28.305 --> 01:31.656
- Bad time?
- I was taking advantage

01:31.656 --> 01:35.225
of the lack of patients
to get some work done.
How can I help you?

01:35.225 --> 01:38.446
I just wanted to thank you
for saving us from
the water contaminant.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.101
It was a team effort.
Angus figured out the cause.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.799
Alicia synthesized the protein
while I was unconscious.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.410
Yeah, but you figured out
the science of it all.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.673
To be honest, I still don'’t
understand how you did it.

01:48.673 --> 01:52.024
Short answer,
we caught a virus
and I figured out a cure.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.852
And the long answer?

01:53.852 --> 01:56.986
Is there something specific
you want to know, Lieutenant?

01:56.986 --> 02:00.859
No. No, just fascinated
by the science of it all.

02:00.859 --> 02:04.254
It took me six months of
all-nighters in med school

02:04.254 --> 02:06.735
to understand molecular protein
reversal synthesis,

02:06.735 --> 02:08.693
so how much time do you have?

02:08.693 --> 02:11.348
Well, I don'’t have
to understand it to know
that you saved us all.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.656
- I'’m sorry. It's just--
- Still not sleeping?

02:14.656 --> 02:18.921
Barely.
Unless you count the coma.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.665
- Why don'’t you take a break?
- I can'’t. I have too much work.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.276
Come on, look,
when was the last time
the Med Bay was empty?

02:26.276 --> 02:28.713
Get some sleep before
the next shite storm hits.
I'’ll keep watch.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.630
I'’ll send for you
if something comes up.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.241
I have to make up
the new shift schedule anyway.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
I can do that from here. Please.

02:38.506 --> 02:42.292
Thank you. I owe you one.
I am so bleary-eyed right now,

02:42.292 --> 02:45.469
I don'’t even know
what I'’m looking at
on that damn thing.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.428
- Of course.
- Thank you.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.846
- You'’re a clone?
- What are you talking about?

03:14.846 --> 03:16.718
You'’re an illegal clone
is what I'’m talking about.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.285
How dare you keep that from us?

03:18.285 --> 03:22.114
The people that need
to know know, okay?

03:22.114 --> 03:25.727
Dr. Kabir knows and sh--

03:25.727 --> 03:27.859
Oh. Is she the one
who told you?

03:27.859 --> 03:29.948
Kabir kept your secret.
I found your med files.

03:29.948 --> 03:33.561
Found or illegally accessed
classified information?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
You could be court-martialed.

03:36.738 --> 03:40.655
By who? You?
You'’re not fit to command.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.961
Oh, I see.
This is yet again
another power play.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.355
Sharon, there'’s a reason
for the clone laws.

03:45.355 --> 03:48.358
You could snap at any moment
and kill someone
just like your sister did.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.447
You need to go
the other way right now!

03:50.447 --> 03:52.667
I'’m trying to give you
an out here.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.583
Look, I'’ll keep
this information to myself,
all right?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.889
- At least until you snap.
- I'’m not going to snap.

03:57.889 --> 04:02.154
Do you know that for a fact?
Relinquish command.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.331
I'’m still the best one
to command this ship,

04:04.331 --> 04:06.637
and I thoroughly
believe that to my core.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.683
And I'’m sorry,
but I don'’t think
you can handle the job.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.511
Oh, I can handle it just fine.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.947
I promise you
I will step aside

04:11.947 --> 04:13.862
if I feel at all like,
you so kindly put,

04:13.862 --> 04:15.211
like I'’m going to snap.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.518
By then you could'’ve
already done the damage.

04:17.518 --> 04:22.000
- Relinquish command.
- Not going to happen.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.394
Then I'’m calling a vote
to have you relieved
of command.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.875
You-- you can'’t reveal
classified information.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.704
I'’ll do whatever it takes
to keep this ship safe,

04:29.704 --> 04:32.663
and that includes
protecting it from the risk
of you melting down.

05:00.256 --> 05:03.651
Lieutenant Garnet'’s clone sister
had a psychotic episode

05:03.651 --> 05:06.697
during which she killed a man
before taking her own life.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.960
There'’s a very real risk
the same thing
will happen to Sharon.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.136
This is a waste of time.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.877
This is necessary
for our safety,

05:12.877 --> 05:14.314
and we need to vote.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.142
- Are we really doing this?
- Yes.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.449
Well, I don'’t mean
to knock the wind out
of your sails, pal,

05:19.449 --> 05:21.582
- but, I mean,
she seems totally fine.
- For how long?

05:21.582 --> 05:23.148
Well, you know what?

05:23.148 --> 05:25.107
I vote for myself,
because a vote for me

05:25.107 --> 05:27.283
is to vote to finally
put an end to all
of this bickering.

05:27.283 --> 05:32.288
Excuse me.
Um, but what'’s wrong
with being a clone?

05:32.288 --> 05:34.290
Years ago,
militaries tried to increase

05:34.290 --> 05:36.423
the size of their armies
by cloning soldiers.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.208
The constant reproduction
from the same original

05:39.208 --> 05:41.079
caused a degradation.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.081
The second tier clones
became psychotic.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.301
For the record,
I'’m first tier.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.869
First tier clones
are no different than
in vitro babies.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.741
I'’m human,
just like anyone else.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.439
It was the introduction
of foreign DNA

05:52.439 --> 05:53.918
that made Denise dangerous.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.920
But you had foreign DNA
put in you, too.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.661
Look, I think we all
understand the risks

05:57.661 --> 05:59.881
of leaving Sharon in charge.

05:59.881 --> 06:03.101
What I understand
you'’re a jerk
who betrayed my trust.

06:03.101 --> 06:07.105
You know, I'’d rather
deal with a possible
mental break from Sharon

06:07.105 --> 06:10.152
than your clinical case
of small penis syndrome.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.161
People died.
They released these time bomb
clones into the world,

06:19.161 --> 06:21.946
where eventually they snapped
and killed people.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.818
Is that really what
we want to happen here?

06:23.818 --> 06:27.299
But didn'’t Lieutenant Garnet
just save all our lives?

06:27.299 --> 06:28.866
Either way, she'’s still human.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.479
Felix, you'’re a man of the law.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.220
Cloning is sacrilege,
but Lieutenant Garnet

06:35.220 --> 06:37.048
is a victim not a perpetrator.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.572
She'’s not to blame for
what other people did to her.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.356
That'’s not what we're
debating here, Felix.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.489
This is about whether or not
she'’s fit to lead.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.187
Garnet'’s a great leader.
I stand with her.
Anyone else?

06:50.105 --> 06:53.108
Acting Captain Garnet,
the floor is yours.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.936
Thank you, Strickland.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.330
Let'’s get back work.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.985
Eva, what will it take to get us
back up to near light speed?

07:00.985 --> 07:05.990
A miracle.
We'’re still repairing the NEPS
from the failed jumpstart.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.733
- It'’s dangerous
to push too hard.
- Dangerous how?

07:09.733 --> 07:13.389
We only have one engine.
If it blows,
we'’re dead in the water.

07:13.389 --> 07:16.523
And if we stay the same speed,
it'’s gonna take us

07:16.523 --> 07:20.048
more than a decade
to reach Proxima B.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.179
We'’re just gonna have to
push it as far as we can.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.138
Let me try to figure it out.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.967
Strickland,
how'’s the murder investigation?

07:25.967 --> 07:27.838
A possible witness
has reached out.

07:27.838 --> 07:31.146
I was on my way to talk to them
before politics intervened.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.234
Good hunting.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.933
Brice, take the bridge.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.633
Alicia, get with Angus

07:39.633 --> 07:41.635
on the new element
he'’s been analyzing.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.114
The one that melted our ship?

07:43.114 --> 07:45.203
See if there'’s a way
to weaponize it

07:45.203 --> 07:47.597
or create some sort of shield
in case we encounter it again.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.000
I guess you'’re gonna
court-martial me.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.784
I should throw you
out of the airlock.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.789
What'’s your frigging problem
with me, Lane?

08:05.789 --> 08:08.226
I already told you.
I'’m afraid you might snap.

08:08.226 --> 08:11.099
Bullshit.
You were on me way before
you knew about that.

08:11.099 --> 08:15.016
I guess I just resent the way
in which you assumed command

08:15.016 --> 08:16.496
without anyone else
having a say in it.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.673
Well, now everyone'’s had a say.
Satisfied?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.370
What do you want me to do?
Apologize?

08:21.370 --> 08:22.850
- Kiss the ring?
- That'’s a good start.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.635
- Is that an order?
- No.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.465
Here'’s your order.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.120
You'’re gonna start seeing Cat
and get over your mommy issues.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.340
- I don'’t have--
- And then...

08:35.340 --> 08:36.820
you'’re gonna swallow
your goddamn pride

08:36.820 --> 08:38.561
and be my second in command.

08:47.004 --> 08:50.051
The Captain wants us to get us
back to near light speed.

08:50.051 --> 08:53.054
- She'’s officially captain now?
- Captain, acting Captain.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.360
I don'’t know.
She'’s in charge.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.277
If we'’re not careful,
the xenon won'’t burn off.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.237
The radiation buildup could
corrode the engine safeties.

09:02.237 --> 09:05.370
I know.
Inch it up by percentages
and monitor it carefully.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.633
Start at 5%.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.986
First signs of trouble,
pull the emergency shutdown.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.560
I think that Eva
might be our murderer.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.737
Eva was in a relationship
with the man who was suffocated
during the oxygen crisis.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.174
- She blamed Jasper--
- The murdered imposter.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.654
Yeah.

09:30.831 --> 09:34.095
I know that she'’s struggling
to process her grief,

09:34.095 --> 09:37.489
but Eva said that Jasper
deserved what he got.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.101
That'’s motive.
Thank you, Cat.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.320
I really don'’t like
betraying confidentiality.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.628
We'’re not talking about
a stolen ration.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.543
You did the right thing
telling me.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.556
Heard you needed my help.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.340
I'’m working on the NEPS.
Can we make it quick?

10:02.340 --> 10:03.472
Understood.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.347
I just have a couple
of questions about
your whereabouts

10:09.347 --> 10:11.785
- when the murder occurred.
- My whereabouts?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.963
Are you accusing me
of this murder?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.660
Only four people
had access to this room.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.968
I don'’t have time for this.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.100
Eva, what are you doing?

10:29.063 --> 10:30.847
Eva!

10:34.329 --> 10:36.766
If I wanted to kill
this asshole, this is how
I would'’ve done it!

10:36.766 --> 10:38.899
It would look like
a heart attack.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.165
God.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.389
And if I did slit his throat,

10:51.389 --> 10:52.739
I wouldn'’t be stupid enough

10:52.739 --> 10:55.350
to throw the knife
into a water system

10:55.350 --> 10:57.744
that I would have to fix.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.660
I am smarter
than whoever did this.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.532
Point made.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.512
Hmm.

12:10.512 --> 12:14.472
Is that a good "hmm"
or a bad "hmm?"

12:14.472 --> 12:18.781
It'’s a weird "hmm."
We'’ve had a drop in thrust.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.742
Would you just do me a favor
and check the xenon levels
at your end? Any drop?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.483
Uh, no change here.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.050
I asked Eva to
goose us up to speed.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.836
Could that have anything
to do with it?

12:29.836 --> 12:31.620
That is just so weird.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.927
Xenon levels should
increase with speed,

12:33.927 --> 12:35.667
and propellant flow rate
and thrust always match.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.714
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.891
Well, I mean, unless there was
a leak in the reactor core.

12:46.156 --> 12:52.075
The last engineer assigned
to the core was Gregor.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.860
Bridge to engine room.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.210
Engineer Ralph Gregor, respond.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.346
Ralph Gregor, report
to the bridge immediately.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.393
Garnet to Eva Markovic.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.656
<i>I need a status report
on engineering, stat.</i>

13:07.656 --> 13:09.310
On my way there.
Strickland delayed me.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.528
<i>Gregor'’s not responding.</i>

13:10.528 --> 13:12.182
I'’ll be there in a second.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.064
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.414
- I'’m really sorry about--
- Yesterday was weird--

13:27.719 --> 13:29.417
Um, you first.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.028
I was gonna say,
that wasn'’t the best
first date.

13:32.028 --> 13:35.771
- Yeah.
- But I think I getting
poisoned by a comet

13:35.771 --> 13:37.164
gives you an automatic do-over.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.296
- If you want one, that is.
- I would.

13:39.296 --> 13:42.517
When would you like to do it?
Over, I mean.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.518
How about right now?

13:46.956 --> 13:49.524
I never experienced
anything like that.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.787
I saw my mom and she was
as critical as ever.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.615
- Does she not approve of me?
- Oh, not at all.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.923
Just so you don'’t feel bad,
she never approved of anyone.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.098
She never really let me date.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.578
Who'’d you see?

14:02.406 --> 14:05.148
- I, uh...
- Oh, I'’m sorry.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.976
That was rude.
I didn'’t mean to...

14:06.976 --> 14:10.066
No, it'’s fine.

14:10.066 --> 14:14.897
I, um-- I saw Susan Ingram.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.378
She was my commanding officer.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.598
Lieutenant Commander?
Maybe you met at boarding.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.297
She died when
we came out of cryo.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.865
Did you know her well?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.650
Um...

14:37.615 --> 14:39.400
I just can'’t believe
this is really happening.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.271
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.752
I had to do
quite a sales pitch
to my superiors

14:43.752 --> 14:46.363
to get them to add you
to the team.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.843
I appreciate it.

14:47.843 --> 14:51.238
This ship is amazing!

14:51.238 --> 14:55.416
As far as I'’m concerned,
William Trust is like a god.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.332
I mean-- I mean, to make
this whole program happen?

14:58.332 --> 15:02.249
We need more people
like you to make his plan
come to fruition.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.037
That'’s why I went
to bat for you.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.779
You sure it wasn'’t because
I'’m such a good kisser?

15:10.779 --> 15:13.913
Well, there'’s that.

15:23.835 --> 15:28.884
She was, uh, my mentor.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.973
If it wasn'’t for her,
I wouldn'’t be on the ship.

15:32.453 --> 15:35.978
I'’m sorry
I never got to meet her.

15:35.978 --> 15:39.939
The good news is
hallucination Susan
liked you very much.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.463
Good.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.857
Then maybe she wouldn'’t mind
if I did this.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.514
- I'’m sorry.
- For what?

15:50.514 --> 15:53.648
I'’m sorry.
I'’ve never kissed
a boy before.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.693
Well, my dad.
On the cheek of course.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.826
But he was my dad,
not a boy.

15:57.826 --> 15:58.870
And I just thought
if I talked about it first,
I might chicken out.

15:58.870 --> 15:59.915
So I just kinda like--

16:08.663 --> 16:10.012
Wow.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.083
Markovic to Bridge.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.910
There'’s a radiation leak
in the NEPS.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.573
- How'’s Gregor?
- Dead.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.836
- Shit.
- It'’s my fault.
I stepped away.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.317
If you hadn'’t,
you might both be dead.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.885
Now, look, can we save
the self-pity until
after we fix this, please?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.539
The leak'’s contained for now,

16:58.539 --> 17:00.976
but we need to seal off the area
in case it doesn'’t hold.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.370
- But how the hell
are we gonna do that?
- Already have my crew on it.

17:03.370 --> 17:07.026
Tell them to keep quiet.
We don'’t wanna create a panic.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.594
If radiation spreads,
the whole ship will go
into automatic lockdown.

17:10.594 --> 17:13.293
Yeah, well,
I think at that point panic
will be the smart move.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.478
Turn this
into a weapon or shield?

17:26.175 --> 17:27.829
Those were our orders?

17:29.352 --> 17:31.789
- Alicia?
- What?

17:31.789 --> 17:36.359
Oh, uh, yeah, the residue,
not the actual glove.

17:36.359 --> 17:39.145
I know. It'’s just...

17:39.145 --> 17:42.409
- A lot to ask?
- Yeah.

17:42.409 --> 17:47.196
I mean, I really want to
disappoint Lieutenant Garnet,
but it'’s like saying,

17:47.196 --> 17:50.199
"Here'’s a glass of water.
Go make a rainstorm."

17:50.199 --> 17:55.204
- Or a really good umbrella.
- Yeah, I mean, a shield
I understand, but...

17:56.814 --> 17:59.165
...why a weapon?

17:59.165 --> 18:02.472
I guess Lieutenant Garnet
thinks that whatever hit us,

18:02.472 --> 18:05.910
if it wasn'’t meteors
or something natural,

18:05.910 --> 18:08.391
if we were attacked
by that stuff,

18:08.391 --> 18:11.481
then we should be able
to shoot back?

18:11.481 --> 18:12.439
I guess.

18:15.485 --> 18:20.316
- Um, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, anything.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.797
What do you think
of Ensign Trent?

18:25.016 --> 18:27.193
Oh.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.673
I mean, I barely know him.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.417
He seems nice enough. Why?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.332
No reason.

18:36.332 --> 18:39.553
Um, okay, let'’s see
if we can maybe figure out

18:39.553 --> 18:42.077
- something with this substance.
- Yes.

18:42.077 --> 18:46.864
Uh, the unknown element
is, well, unknown.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.650
It was found in a small
crystalline, pellet-like--

18:49.650 --> 18:52.914
Container.
So does that mean
it was manufactured?

18:52.914 --> 18:57.136
Not necessarily. It could be
naturally occurring that way,
like milk in a coconut.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.660
Well, accept this milk
eats through almost
anything it touches,

18:59.660 --> 19:04.447
so it could be engineered
like a weapon and shot at us.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.290
So...

19:21.290 --> 19:23.727
...everyone who had access to
the room has been cleared.

19:25.468 --> 19:29.820
So we'’re back to square one?
Everybody'’s a suspect?

19:29.820 --> 19:31.866
We need to look at
the other potential evidence,

19:31.866 --> 19:33.868
like the anonymous message
Lane was sent.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.304
I'’ve been trying to analyze it,

19:35.304 --> 19:37.306
but I wasn'’t put on the ark
for my tech skills.

19:37.306 --> 19:40.701
That'’s all right.
We'’re all doing what we can.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.920
Have you checked
the message'’s
point of origin?

19:42.920 --> 19:46.663
Yeah, but I keep getting
this strange code.

19:46.663 --> 19:47.664
Let me see.

19:53.061 --> 19:57.892
- It'’s just random numbers.
- Maybe they'’re not so random.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.285
Whenever anyone
sends a message,

19:59.285 --> 20:01.939
it gets stamped
with a protocol ID.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.203
It identifies where
the message originated.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.727
You mean the actual tablet
or terminal it was sent from?

20:06.727 --> 20:11.122
Right. And if you try to remove
a sender name from a message,

20:11.122 --> 20:15.083
the system automatically
replaces it with a protocol ID.

20:15.083 --> 20:19.957
- So that tells us where
the message was sent from?
- In this case, a tablet.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.786
If I cross-check that
with the message'’s timestamp,

20:22.786 --> 20:26.268
I can see who was logged into
that tablet at the time.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.359
No way.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.623
The logs don'’t lie.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.547
Well, well, well.
Garnet told me to expect you.

20:44.547 --> 20:45.983
Take a seat.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.211
I don'’t need therapy.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.952
And how does that
make you feel?

20:57.952 --> 20:59.562
It'’s a waste
of both of our time.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.304
Why don'’t we start with
why you hate Garnet so much?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.350
Is it just her
or do you hate all women?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.613
What I hate is when
someone is promoted

21:06.613 --> 21:10.051
to a position of power
they don'’t deserve, like you.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.618
So, all women then.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.622
If you must know,
I don'’t trust Garnet.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.277
She was added to our team
minutes before departure

21:18.277 --> 21:20.714
and none of knew
anything about her.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.019
I mean, don'’t you think
that'’s weird?

21:22.019 --> 21:24.935
You don'’t think
I deserve this job.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.981
Well, I didn'’t ask for it,
you know.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.244
It was foisted on me.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.898
Did you just hear a word
I just said?

21:32.247 --> 21:33.857
Hmm?

21:43.998 --> 21:47.610
That'’s the 17th
failed simulation.
It'’s not gonna work.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.133
Maybe 18th time'’s the charm?

21:49.133 --> 21:52.180
There is nothing
that works as a shield.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.314
We can'’t make a weapon,
because no matter how many
variations we try,

21:55.314 --> 21:59.840
we just don'’t have enough of
the element to synthesize it.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.755
Then maybe we should figure out
how to find more.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.409
That'’s not a bad idea.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.845
What? Finding more residue?

22:04.845 --> 22:07.021
No, figuring out
how to find it.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.936
We probably have enough
of the residue

22:08.936 --> 22:11.852
to reconfigure
the ship'’s sensors
to be on alert for it.

22:11.852 --> 22:14.245
- So if there'’s more out there--
- We'’ll have an early
warning system.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.686
Strickland, um,
how can we help?

22:19.686 --> 22:23.254
Alicia Nevins,
you'’re under arrest for
the murder of Malcolm Perry.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.473
What?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.567
This is insane.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.700
You know I'’m not a murderer.
Please!

22:33.700 --> 22:38.487
- Please, Strickland,
you have to believe me.
- I believe you.

22:38.487 --> 22:41.882
I know you were at your station
at the time of the murder.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.013
I'’m sorry we had to do this.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.493
Someone used your credentials

22:44.493 --> 22:46.887
to send Lane the video
of Garnet'’s sister.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.368
Wait, so that was all for show?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.109
It stands to reason
that whoever wanted to
frame Lieutenant Garnet

22:52.109 --> 22:53.850
could be very well
be our murderer.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.157
But why would anyone
want to use my credentials?

22:56.157 --> 22:59.116
I don'’t know.
Perhaps convenience.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.944
Does anyone else have access
to your password?

23:05.819 --> 23:08.735
- Oh, my God.
- What?

23:08.735 --> 23:09.823
Oh, my God.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.739
I really hate this.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.961
Alicia,
do you know something?

23:19.920 --> 23:23.750
I-- I think I know
who the murderer is.

23:39.330 --> 23:43.552
I thought the murderer
was someone with clearance
to access this room.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.598
- That'’s what we all thought.
- We were wrong.

23:45.598 --> 23:49.384
The murderer is someone with
the skill to pick the lock.

23:49.384 --> 23:52.561
<i>During the oxygen crisis,
Ensign Baylor Trent</i>

23:52.561 --> 23:53.910
<i>demonstrated his ability
to pick locks...</i>

23:56.435 --> 23:58.567
...twice.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.003
But what'’s Trent's connection
to the victim?

24:00.003 --> 24:01.178
Unknown.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.180
That'’s a little circumstantial.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.792
- Just '’cause the kid
can pick a lock?
- I'’d agree...

24:05.792 --> 24:07.750
if he hadn'’t stolen
Alicia'’s login credentials.

24:10.144 --> 24:13.321
It was during the comet crisis.

24:13.321 --> 24:16.193
<i>I was in such a rush
to tell you about the comet,</i>

24:16.193 --> 24:17.456
<i>I left my tablet behind.</i>

24:27.509 --> 24:29.511
Oh.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.557
<i>When Trent returned
the tablet to me,</i>

24:31.557 --> 24:33.428
<i>I knew he had it
the whole time.</i>

24:33.428 --> 24:37.345
He tried to frame you both.
I'’d like to know why.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.260
There'’s only one way
to find out.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.315
Oh, shit.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.286
Move, move, move!

25:23.609 --> 25:25.480
Oh, shit.

25:25.480 --> 25:29.615
Where were you running to?
We'’re in space.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.312
There'’s nowhere to hide.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.848
- Why did you kill the stowaway?
- Look, he was an imposter.

25:45.848 --> 25:47.850
- And that'’s reason to kill him?
- Oh, no, no, no.

25:47.850 --> 25:51.506
You don'’t get it.
He disrupted the balance.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.377
Great.
Well, that clears that up.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.292
In order for our mission
to succeed,

25:55.292 --> 25:56.729
everyone must have their place.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.733
Look, it'’s like you said,
Lieutenant Lane.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.299
It'’s survival
of the fittest, right?

26:06.086 --> 26:10.307
- Why did you frame Garnet?
- I have a place here.

26:10.307 --> 26:13.963
Garnet wasn'’t
even on the roster.
She was expendable.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.836
Look, with half of us gone,

26:16.836 --> 26:18.141
we have to work
that much harder

26:18.141 --> 26:20.013
to keep the balance.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.581
Can anyone tell me what the hell
this kid is talking about?

26:24.670 --> 26:27.934
We have to get
these barriers up faster.

26:34.331 --> 26:35.985
Okay, time'’s up!
We need to get out of here.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.117
Come on!

26:41.164 --> 26:42.862
Attention, all hands.

26:42.862 --> 26:46.343
<i>All personnel evacuate
sectors two through five.</i>

26:46.343 --> 26:49.172
<i>This includes cargo pods,
bioshelter, showers.</i>

26:49.172 --> 26:51.522
<i>Everyone, move forward!</i>

27:10.063 --> 27:12.239
- I thought we had this
under control.
- So did I.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.371
You can contain it though, right?

27:14.371 --> 27:16.547
Initiating nuclear
decon protocol.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.288
- Shit.
- What?

27:18.288 --> 27:20.508
NEPS remote access controls
have melted at the source.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.945
I can'’t shut down
the leak from the bridge.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.904
If you don'’t stop that leak,
we'’re all dead.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.514
I have to do it manually.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.690
Send someone
into a radioactive zone?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.779
- No one can survive that.
- I know.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.087
You mean a suicide mission.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.487
<i>Attention, all hands,
this is Garnet.</i>

27:43.487 --> 27:46.055
<i>Unfortunately, there'’s been
a radiation breach</i>

27:46.055 --> 27:48.797
<i>in our nuclear electronic
propulsion system,</i>

27:48.797 --> 27:51.626
<i>and we'’ve lost the ability
to stop it remotely.</i>

27:51.626 --> 27:53.628
<i>It has to be done manually.</i>

27:53.628 --> 27:57.980
<i>I can'’t force anyone
to do this,</i>

27:57.980 --> 28:00.417
<i>so I'’m asking
for a volunteer.</i>

28:00.417 --> 28:02.898
<i>Someone who'’s willing
to sacrifice themselves</i>

28:02.898 --> 28:04.639
<i>so the rest of us can live.</i>

28:04.639 --> 28:10.210
This is an impossible situation,

28:10.210 --> 28:13.213
but if someone doesn'’t do this,

28:13.213 --> 28:14.257
our journey ends here.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.306
- I'’ll do it.
- Absolutely not.

28:19.306 --> 28:23.440
Well, I don'’t see anyone else
with their hand raised, do you?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.442
We can'’t wait exactly
wait around till nuts up.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.140
I can'’t clear you for this.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.447
Not with that knee.

28:30.447 --> 28:31.579
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:31.579 --> 28:33.668
We need someone able-bodied.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.930
There'’s nothing wrong
with my knee.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.454
Doesn'’t matter.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.369
We can'’t afford to lose
our only navigator.

28:44.766 --> 28:48.422
- I'’ll do it.
- Sharon...

28:50.554 --> 28:51.773
You'’re about to get
what you wanted.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.254
What?
I didn'’t want it this way.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.083
Listen to me.
You'’re gonna be a great leader.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.432
That'’s not what
you said before.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.956
Well, just put the crew
before your ego.

29:00.956 --> 29:05.134
- Can we at least
just discuss this first?
- We'’re running out of time.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.399
Sharon.

29:12.272 --> 29:15.014
- You'’ve gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

29:16.972 --> 29:18.408
Give me ten minutes
before you do this.

29:18.408 --> 29:22.630
- What are you doing?
- Just promise me.

29:36.165 --> 29:38.733
You better make this good,
because the last thing
I wanna be doing

29:38.733 --> 29:41.127
is spending what little time
I might have left with you.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.824
I heard you'’re looking
for a volunteer.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.131
- You mean you?
- Yep.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.135
- It'’s a suicide mission.
- I know.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.878
Why should I trust you?

29:52.878 --> 29:54.880
Because there'’s
something on this ship

29:54.880 --> 29:55.924
that you need to know about.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.539
I have a volunteer.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.237
Spence,
have you lost your mind?

30:04.237 --> 30:06.892
Look, we want a volunteer,
we have one.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.893
Can I talk?

30:09.546 --> 30:11.548
I know no one
understands what I did.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.289
Well, you slit a man'’s throat.
It wasn'’t exactly subtle.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.944
Everything I did
was to keep people safe,

30:15.944 --> 30:20.122
and I'’m ready to do this
to save Ark One and the mission.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.472
Why should anyone believe
an asshole like you?

30:22.472 --> 30:25.649
I'’m sorry, Alicia. Okay?
I never meant to hurt you.

30:25.649 --> 30:29.218
Shut up!
Why should anyone believe you?

30:31.873 --> 30:32.961
Because he does.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.096
Lane, are you vouching for him?

30:39.576 --> 30:41.840
- I guess I am.
- You'’re gonna kill me anyway.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.102
We haven'’t even discussed
your sentence.

30:43.102 --> 30:45.452
Just let me do something
good before I die.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.675
What is this?

30:53.764 --> 30:56.158
Just let him do it.

30:56.158 --> 30:57.420
I'’m gonna need more than that.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.949
Look, you wanted me
to trust you as our leader.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.908
Now I need you to trust me
as your number two.

31:06.908 --> 31:10.259
He'’s the man for the job,
and we can'’t lose you.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.914
We'’re out of time.
Someone has to do this now.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.484
You don'’t have to trust him,
Sharon. Just me.

31:24.795 --> 31:28.408
This suit is designed
for solar radiation,
not atomic radiation.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.192
Best it can do
is slow the effects.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.628
And we'’ll track your progress.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.195
Eva will open each bulkhead
as you come to it.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.328
Do not stop.
Just keep moving.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.948
It'’s now or never, Trent.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.691
Okay.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.058
He'’s ready.

32:10.058 --> 32:13.409
Opening first bulkhead
in three,

32:13.409 --> 32:15.368
<i>two...</i>

32:16.760 --> 32:18.153
...one.

32:28.163 --> 32:31.123
Door! Door!

32:40.393 --> 32:45.746
Door! Door!

32:48.053 --> 32:50.490
- We'’re losing the feed.
- Yeah.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.100
Yeah, he'’s running
into high radiation levels.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.500
Door!

33:00.500 --> 33:01.414
Come on, Trent.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.290
Jesus Christ.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.294
Come on.

33:25.699 --> 33:26.787
Door!

33:35.709 --> 33:36.623
Door.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.627
What'’s happening?

33:40.627 --> 33:45.023
We'’re losing the feed.
Come on. You got this.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.156
- Eva, come on.
Get the feed back.
- I can'’t.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.597
Door!

33:54.597 --> 33:56.512
<i>Open door.</i>

33:58.732 --> 33:59.602
Open the damn door!

34:01.126 --> 34:03.084
Eva, get the goddamn
door open now.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.868
It won'’t open!

34:04.868 --> 34:06.827
<i>Trent, we can'’t open it
from our end.</i>

34:14.139 --> 34:15.749
I can'’t... get in.

34:15.749 --> 34:18.186
Try again! Aw, man.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.889
What'’s happening?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.239
One of the doors
is inoperable.
He'’s stuck.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.588
What do you mean inoperable?

34:28.588 --> 34:30.024
There'’s no way
to open the door!

34:30.024 --> 34:32.896
Trent, can you hear me?

34:32.896 --> 34:34.507
<i>Trent, answer me!</i>

34:34.507 --> 34:37.945
Ensign? Ensign, report!

34:37.945 --> 34:39.512
Guys, we are
running out of time. Come on.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.427
- Eva, open the door.
- I can'’t!

34:41.427 --> 34:43.211
He'’s not gonna last!
He'’s exposed to radiation!

34:43.211 --> 34:45.561
- I know!
- Come on, Eva.
You got this.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.608
- Open the damn door!
- She'’s doing her best!

34:48.608 --> 34:50.436
We need to think of something.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.181
Trent.
Trent, listen to me.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.530
You need to find a way.

34:57.530 --> 35:00.054
- Yeah.
<i>- Remember your mission.</i>

35:02.796 --> 35:04.058
Okay.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.677
Come on, come on.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.118
Okay.

36:07.426 --> 36:08.731
Trent?

36:10.342 --> 36:11.169
Trent?

36:21.483 --> 36:23.746
Anti-radiation scrubber
activated!

36:37.586 --> 36:39.109
Thank you for trusting me.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.937
We'’re gonna need
to have a talk

36:40.937 --> 36:42.461
about what Trent said to you.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.767
Of course.

36:55.430 --> 36:58.520
- Dr. Kabir.
- If it'’s not life-threatening,

36:58.520 --> 37:00.130
- take a number.
- Just the opposite.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.525
My murder investigation is over,
so if you need a hand...

37:03.525 --> 37:05.962
Okay, so most of
these people are suffering

37:05.962 --> 37:07.747
from radiation poisoning,
burns, and the like,

37:07.747 --> 37:11.968
so first you need to, um...

37:11.968 --> 37:13.231
- Excuse me a second.
- Mm-hmm.

37:16.190 --> 37:21.413
- Here for your knee?
- There'’s nothing wrong
with my knee.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.198
And you know,
I don'’t really appreciate
you lying about me like that.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.983
Yeah, well,
I don'’t appreciate
you lying to me.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.115
- Lying to you?
- Mm-hmm.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.725
When have I lied to you?

37:29.725 --> 37:31.466
We'’ve barely ever
had a conversation.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.252
I'’ve seen your medical records.
They'’re perfect.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.603
They'’re too perfect
to be real.

37:37.603 --> 37:41.389
You'’ve risked your life
for two spacewalks,
the comet assignment,

37:41.389 --> 37:44.000
and you just volunteered
for a suicide mission.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.568
You clearly have a death wish,

37:46.568 --> 37:49.832
and I'’m worried
you'’re going to take
the ship with you.

37:49.832 --> 37:53.271
Yeah, look,
you'’ve really got no idea
what you'’re talking about.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.142
Okay, well,
you know where I am

37:55.142 --> 37:57.405
whenever you wanna
update your records.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.973
In the meantime,
ice that knee.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.195
There'’s nothing wrong
with my knee.

38:05.195 --> 38:08.416
Unfortunately, we can'’t
weaponize the element

38:08.416 --> 38:10.200
or create any sort
of countermeasure devices.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.942
Yet you look excited, Angus.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.770
We'’ve come up with
the next best thing.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.816
It'’s an early warning system
in case we come within range

38:16.816 --> 38:18.296
of the element again.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.254
Yeah, it'’s just a matter
of augmenting our sensors

38:20.254 --> 38:22.256
to look for the element'’s
unique properties.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.040
I can upload it to
the sensor system right now.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.087
- On your word, of course.
- Do it.

38:27.087 --> 38:29.829
- Well done.
- I was worried
you'’d be mad at us

38:29.829 --> 38:31.265
- for failing our assignment.
- Not at all.

38:31.265 --> 38:33.615
You thought outside the box.
I admire that.

38:33.615 --> 38:36.270
The scrubbers
have cleared the ship.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.058
Bridge to all personnel.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.800
I am pleased to announce
all radiation risk
has been cleared.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.238
The ship can now
safely reopen.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.286
One step forward,
two steps back.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.070
It'’s gonna take time
to make the repairs,

38:54.070 --> 38:56.856
and get us up
to a decent speed,
if that'’s even possible.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.248
I know you'’ll figure it out.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.470
Lane.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.081
You were really going to do it?

39:05.081 --> 39:07.693
Before Trent volunteered?

39:07.693 --> 39:10.565
- You were going to
take the hit for us?
- Is that a question?

39:12.828 --> 39:14.700
I think I underestimated you.

39:18.312 --> 39:22.664
I know I underestimated you.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.449
What did Trent say
to convince you?

39:27.103 --> 39:28.888
I didn'’t wanna say this
with everyone in here,

39:28.888 --> 39:31.020
but Trent did it for you, Alicia.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.982
Something about you having
your whole life ahead of you.

39:35.982 --> 39:39.289
He didn'’t want you to die
and miss that.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.083
Um...

39:57.960 --> 39:59.919
Well, I don'’t know about you,
but I feel like this session

39:59.919 --> 40:04.706
- is a long time coming.
- Yeah.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.142
You'’re gonna need
to get rid of that poster.

40:06.142 --> 40:08.449
Where should we begin?

40:08.449 --> 40:11.147
I'’ll do the talking,
you do the listening?

40:11.147 --> 40:13.236
Of course.
This is a safe space.

40:13.236 --> 40:16.501
Don'’t be afraid to be free.
Go where your instincts want to.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.068
- Cat?
- Listening.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.288
Earlier today,
Lieutenant Lane called me
a ticking time bomb, and--

40:21.288 --> 40:23.899
- Question.
- Sure, go ahead.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.946
Lane is highly emotional.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.861
If anyone'’s a time bomb,
it'’s him.

40:28.861 --> 40:32.865
- That was a question?
- What are you afraid of?

40:32.865 --> 40:34.997
That he might be right.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.745
<i>My mission was clear.</i>

40:43.745 --> 40:45.704
<i>Jasper found out,
so he had to die.</i>

40:47.923 --> 40:50.230
<i>So everything about
"the balance" was bullshit?</i>

40:50.230 --> 40:54.147
No. Balance is only
part of the mission.

40:54.147 --> 40:58.586
After Susan died, you said
not everyone would make it,

40:58.586 --> 41:01.067
and that was my second clue
that you were one of us.

41:01.067 --> 41:04.374
What was the first?

41:04.374 --> 41:08.030
I saw something in you
in the send-off ceremony.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.815
Trust on speaker:
<i>I'’m William Trust.</i>

41:09.815 --> 41:11.556
- <i>Full of people...</i>
- I thought Trust got fired

41:11.556 --> 41:14.210
from his own company
because he went crazy.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.343
Most geniuses
are a little crazy.

41:16.343 --> 41:19.215
That'’s when I knew.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.869
I knew you were one of us,

41:20.869 --> 41:24.438
<i>that you had it in you
to complete our mission.</i>

41:39.235 --> 41:44.023
<i>Susan, she opened my eyes
to a higher purpose,</i>

41:44.023 --> 41:46.329
<i>and now I'’m gonna do
the same for you.</i>

42:07.133 --> 42:10.615
<i>Come on, just think
about it, Lane.</i>

42:10.615 --> 42:13.139
<i>Where would we be
without him?</i>

42:13.139 --> 42:14.923
<i>He'’s the reason we're alive.</i>

42:16.751 --> 42:20.276
<i>It'’s all his plan,
his grand design.</i>

42:20.276 --> 42:23.802
<i>Okay, I will save this ship
for one simple reason.</i>

42:23.802 --> 42:27.414
<i>To save William Trust.</i>

42:27.414 --> 42:30.069
<i>It'’s my duty.</i>

42:30.069 --> 42:33.855
<i>Now it'’s your duty
to keep Trust safe</i>

42:33.855 --> 42:36.075
<i>because there are people
aboard this ship</i>

42:36.075 --> 42:38.120
<i>who might want him dead.</i>
