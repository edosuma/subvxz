AND MAKE CONTACT
WITH CROSSWHITE.WELL, THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.561
MY PEOPLE AND I
ARE GONNA HANDLE THIS.

14:26.561 --> 14:30.391
YOU DON'T WANT TO START
A GUNFIGHT UNLESS YOU NEED TO.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.872
WE SHOULD GET
THE INFORMATION FIRST.IF I'M HEARING RIGHT,

14:32.872 --> 14:36.614
GOT A GROUP OF CITIZENS IN THERE
BEING THREATENED BY A NUT

14:36.614 --> 14:39.487

14:57.505 --> 15:00.116
SEE YOU WHEN WE'RE DONE.CBI HAS AUTHORITY HERE.

15:00.116 --> 15:03.076
I WILL START ARRESTING YOUR MEN
AND PUTTING THEM IN CUFFS

15:03.076 --> 15:05.600
IF YOU DON'T
STAND DOWN RIGHT NOW.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.081
CHIEF, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.084
NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.521
CBI HAS JURISDICTION...

15:13.521 --> 15:15.218
FOR NOW.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.454
JANE, RIGHT? CBI?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:33.454 --> 15:36.413
NOTHING. IN FACT, I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.415
I JUST HEARD
ON MY POLICE SCANNER

15:38.415 --> 15:40.940
THAT YOU GUYS WERE
LOOKING TO ARREST ME.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.551
YOU PEOPLE THOUGHT ALL ALONG
THAT I KILLED AMBER, DIDN'T YOU?

15:43.551 --> 15:45.945
WHAT I THOUGHT IS
IRRELEVANT NOW, BUT HOW EXACTLY

15:45.945 --> 15:48.121
IS THIS GUN-WAVING SUPPOSED
TO ESTABLISH YOUR INNOCENCE?

15:48.121 --> 15:51.298
OH, I TRIED TALKING.
IT DOESN'T WORK. NOBODY LISTENS.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.865
[cell phone ringing]MIND IF I GET THAT?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.693
[ring]

15:55.693 --> 15:57.478
[ring]

15:57.478 --> 15:59.480
HELLO?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.438
JANE? ARE YOU IN CITY HALL?

16:01.438 --> 16:02.483
Uh...

16:02.483 --> 16:03.919
YES, UNFORTUNATELY.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.181
IS ANYBODY HURT?

16:05.181 --> 16:06.704
NOT MORTALLY, YET.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.619
What's going on?

16:08.619 --> 16:12.362
I'D LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU,
LISBON, BUT THERE'S A MAN HERE

16:12.362 --> 16:15.539
WITH A LARGE GUN,
WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.WHO'S THIS?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.541
MR. CROSSWHITE,
THIS IS AGENT LISBON.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.500
LET'S JUST TAKE IT EASY,
OKAY?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.546
YOU TELL ALL THOSE COPS
TO STAY OUT OF HERE.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.940
I WILL. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
MR. CROSSWHITE?

16:24.940 --> 16:27.987
WHY--WHY AM I DOING THIS?
WHY ARE YOUDOING THIS?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.380
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING
BUT TALKING TO YOU.

16:30.380 --> 16:33.949
WHAT DO YOU WANT?I WANT A GUARANTEE
FROM THE GOVERNOR

16:33.949 --> 16:36.952
AND THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
THAT I WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED

16:36.952 --> 16:39.781
FOR THE DEATH
OF AMBER SUTHERLAND.WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.522
AND I WANT--

16:41.522 --> 16:43.915
I WANT A NEW INVESTIGATION
INTO MY WIFE'S DEATH,

16:43.915 --> 16:46.483
and I want
the real killer found.

16:46.483 --> 16:49.573
DO IT NOW.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.315
I HAD TWO MONTHS
LEFT ON THAT PLAN.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.405
MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO HEAR
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE.

16:55.405 --> 16:58.495
IF WE CAN PATCH INTO THE MAIN
SWITCHBOARD FOR CITY HALL,

16:58.495 --> 17:00.802
WE CAN TURN ANY PHONE
WITH A SPEAKER ON IT

17:00.802 --> 17:03.239
INTO A MICROPHONE.DO IT. WHERE'S NAIL?

17:03.239 --> 17:06.068
HE'S TAKEN OVER THE CAFE ON
THE CORNER FOR A COMMAND CENTER.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.899
NAIL'S TAPPED INTO
THE CAMERAS AROUND CITY HALL.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.341
IT'S CLEVER.WELL, JUST TRYING
TO KEEP UP.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.474
IT'S THE REAR ENTRANCE
TO CITY HALL.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.998
IT'S ALARMED, BUT WE CAN
DISARM IT FROM HERE.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.436
WE CREATE A DISTRACTION
IN FRONT, SEND MEN IN THAT WAY,

17:26.436 --> 17:29.004
AND WE'LL MINIMIZE CASUALTIES.IT'S PROCEDURE TO TRY
AND TALK THE PERSON

17:29.004 --> 17:32.094
WHO'S TAKEN THE HOSTAGES OUT.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

17:32.094 --> 17:35.358
WORK WITH ME, LISBON.
WE NEED A PLAN "B."

17:35.358 --> 17:39.014
HELL WITH THAT. LET'S GO.WE ARE NOT GOING IN UNLESS
CROSSWHITE FIRES FIRST.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.885
IT'S THE SAFEST PATH.

17:40.885 --> 17:44.063
UNLESS YOU'RE THE FIRST HOSTAGE
CROSSWHITE DECIDES TO SHOOT.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.414
SOMEONE WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:47.414 --> 17:50.330
MAYOR BAGSHAW,
I'M AGENT LISBON WITH THE CBI.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.245
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.422
NAIL, WHAT'S THE PLAN?FLASHBANGS THROUGH
THE SIDE WINDOW,

17:55.422 --> 17:58.251
MOVE IN THROUGH THE BACK,
TAKE CROSSWHITE OUT.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.514
GET STARTED ON IT.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.517
AN ASSAULT LIKE THAT SHOULD BE
THE LAST RESORT, NOT THE FIRST.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.911
A HALF-DOZEN PEOPLE, INCLUDING
MY WIFE, ARE IN THAT BUILDING

18:06.911 --> 18:09.349
WITH AN ARMED LUNATIC.
I WANT THEM OUT.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.482
I WON'T ALLOW IT.
CBI HAS THE AUTHORITY HERE.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.181
NO. NOT ANYMORE.
YOU'RE TO WORK WITH US NOW.

18:15.181 --> 18:19.794
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, TALK TO
YOUR BOSS. I ALREADY DID.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.277
[clears throat][taps key]

18:26.496 --> 18:28.411
LISBON, IT'S A MATTER

18:28.411 --> 18:31.806
OF TAKING THE FEELINGS
OF THE LOCALS INTO ACCOUNT.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.635
SIR, THIS IS A MATTER
OF PEOPLE NOT GETTING KILLED.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.290
You'll do your best
to prevent that, I trust.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.292
I CAN'T IF I DON'T
HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.642
NOW I KNOW MAYOR BAGSHAW HAS
A LOT OF INFLUENCE, BUT--

18:41.642 --> 18:44.253
NO, THERE'S NO "BUT." ALL RIGHT?
INFLUENCE HAS INFLUENCE.

18:44.253 --> 18:47.213
I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THE POLITICS OF THIS TO YOU,

18:47.213 --> 18:48.431
DO I?

18:48.431 --> 18:50.868
SIR, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT POLITICS.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.914
EVERYTHING'S POLITICS,
LISBON...

18:52.914 --> 18:55.482
one way or another.

18:55.482 --> 18:59.312
TRY PERSUASION.
WORKS WONDERS.[elevator bell dings]

19:07.320 --> 19:09.496
WHAT'S THE WORD?WE'RE ON OUR OWN.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.715
NO, YOU DON'T WANT THEM GOING
IN. WE BETTER DO SOMETHING.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.370
THEY'RE SADDLING UP.TERESA, I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.981
BUT I'M BABYSITTING A BUNCH
OF REPORTERS OUT THERE

19:16.981 --> 19:18.940
WHO'LL TAKE A MINUTE
WHENEVER YOU'VE GOT ONE.NOT NOW, BRENDA.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.942
FINE. UH, LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU CAN.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.988
WAIT A MINUTE. ONE. NOW.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.555
GREAT. UH, ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.383
OR SHOULD I JUST
PICK SOMEBODY?

19:27.383 --> 19:30.517
WHO DO YOU THINK HAS THE BEST
ACCESS TO DIRECTOR BERTRAM?

19:38.002 --> 19:41.005
WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. WE HAVE
A RIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOM.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.313
THERE'S ONE
IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE,

19:44.313 --> 19:46.359
JUST RIGHT AROUND
THAT CORNER.

19:50.711 --> 19:53.322
[lowered voice] HEY,
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE COPS

19:53.322 --> 19:55.194
FROM OUT OF TOWN, RIGHT?

19:57.718 --> 20:01.287
UH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.333
ARE YOU, LIKE, WORKING ON
A PLAN TO GET US OUT OF THIS?

20:04.333 --> 20:07.858
YES. OF COURSE I AM.WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:07.858 --> 20:12.211
WELL, I'M--
I'M THINKING. AND WAITING.

20:14.517 --> 20:18.347
WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, 5?
A LITTLE PATIENCE HERE.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.439

[indistinct conversations]

20:30.577 --> 20:33.971
[tires screech]

20:33.971 --> 20:36.409
[Patrick] THEY'RE GONNA
COME IN, YOU KNOW.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.411
AND IT'S GONNA GET
ALL SHOOTY.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.456
WHAT'S THAT GONNA PROVE?

20:42.458 --> 20:45.374
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T PUT THIS ON ME.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.812
YOU'RE LIKE
ALL THE REST OF THEM.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.338
YOU JUST DECIDED I KILLED AMBER.
S-SAME WAY THEY JUST DECIDED

20:52.338 --> 20:55.210
I KILLED MY WIFE.WELL, MORE TIMES THAN NOT,
IT IS THE HUSBAND THAT DID IT.

20:55.210 --> 20:58.518
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T.
THERE WERE BREAK-INS

20:58.518 --> 21:01.564
ALL AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THIS WAS A ROBBERY GONE WRONG.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.437
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE SOME CAMERA
SAYS I WAS SOMEPLACE

21:04.437 --> 21:07.222
WHEN I WASN'T. NO, THEY DIDN'T
EVEN BOTHER TO--TO--

21:07.222 --> 21:10.225
TO LOOK INTO THE ROBBERIES.THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.792
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

21:11.792 --> 21:14.795
WE LOOKED INTO THOSE BREAK-INS.
IT WAS JUST KIDS.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.406
THEY TURNED ON EACH OTHER
THE MOMENT THEY GOT ARRESTED.

21:17.406 --> 21:20.496
THEY'RE NOT KILLERS.DONNA...

21:20.496 --> 21:23.456
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
IN THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.372
NO, I-I JUST SAID

34:08.350 --> 34:11.092
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

34:14.791 --> 34:16.837
[doors close]

34:18.143 --> 34:20.232
[police radio chatter]

34:24.279 --> 34:26.455
OH, THAT'S A LOT OF GUNS.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.507
DROP YOUR WEAPON NOW!

34:34.507 --> 34:38.380
[crowd murmuring]

34:38.380 --> 34:40.643
YOU GET CROSSWHITE.
WE'LL GET THE HOSTAGES OUT.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.342
ON YOUR BELLY!
HANDS BY YOUR SIDES!

34:43.342 --> 34:45.126
SPREAD YOUR LEGS
AND DON'T MOVE!

34:53.526 --> 34:55.528
YOU ALL RIGHT?RIGHT AS RAIN.

34:57.399 --> 35:01.838
EASY, RIGSBY. EASY.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.189
[handcuffs click]

35:08.018 --> 35:09.455
[Bertram] JESSICA!

35:26.167 --> 35:29.257
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAD IT WRONG.

35:29.257 --> 35:31.564
THERE WAS NO ENVELOPE
ON THE MAYOR'S DESK.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.740
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA SEE THIS.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.872
THERE'S NOTHING THERE BECAUSE
YOU HAVE IT STUFFED

35:35.872 --> 35:39.224
INSIDE YOUR BULLETPROOF VEST.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.878
EXCUSE ME?

35:41.878 --> 35:44.707
AND HE KILLED
AMBER SUTHERLAND.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.928
ARNOLD?

35:47.928 --> 35:51.323
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON COULD
I HAVE TO HURT THOSE WOMEN?

35:51.323 --> 35:54.326
WELL, GINGER, I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT YET, BUT AMBER...

35:54.326 --> 35:57.764
SHE FOUND OUT, DIDN'T SHE?YOU GOT YOUR KILLER
RIGHT THERE.

35:57.764 --> 36:00.680
YEAH, AND YOU WERE TERRIFIED
I WAS STARTING TO BELIEVE HIM.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.422
IF HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH

36:03.422 --> 36:06.860
ABOUT WHAT TIME HE CAME HOME
THAT NIGHT...THEN THE SECURITY FOOTAGE
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

36:06.860 --> 36:10.907
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?WELL, IT'S UNLIKELY THE ELECTRIC
COMPANY MEDDLED WITH IT.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.693
YOU HAD ACCESS TO THE EVIDENCE
AND YOU CHANGED IT.

36:13.693 --> 36:16.304
AMBER, THE VIDEO EXPERT,
FIGURED IT OUT.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.960
AND THEN YOU KILLED HER.
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW

36:19.960 --> 36:22.354
IS SHE LEFT A MESSAGE
ABOUT WHAT SHE FOUND

36:22.354 --> 36:25.357
ON THE MAYOR'S DESK.THERE WAS NO ENVELOPE.

36:25.357 --> 36:29.709
YES, THERE WAS...
'CAUSE I PUT IT THERE.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.279
NOW LET'S SEE IT.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.155
CHIEF NAIL,
TAKE OFF YOUR VEST.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.294
[Velcro rips]

36:54.212 --> 36:56.170
OPEN IT.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.351
READ IT OUT.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.355
"ARREST ME."

37:09.575 --> 37:12.404
OKAY.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.362
LOOK AT THAT, HUH?

37:14.362 --> 37:17.191
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY THAT TWICE.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.149
I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL!

37:19.149 --> 37:20.890
DON'T DO IT!

37:20.890 --> 37:22.152
UHH!

37:24.590 --> 37:26.331
THAT WAS CLOSE.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.377
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING AT
THE SECURITY FOOTAGE RIGHT NOW.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.379
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

37:31.379 --> 37:33.947
BEFORE THEY FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU DID.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.515
NOW YOU'RE A COP
ABOUT TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM.

37:36.515 --> 37:39.605
YOU DO THE MATH.

37:39.605 --> 37:44.653
GINGER CROSSWHITE
GOT HERSELF KILLED.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.265
I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.226
WE'D TALKED AT CITY HALL.
SHE WAS NOT AN INNOCENT.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.315
SHE MARRIED DOWN.
ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT--

37:54.315 --> 37:57.057
I CERTAINLY COULD.

37:57.057 --> 38:00.452
IT WAS CLEAR AS DAY
THAT SHE WAS UNHAPPY.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.323
THERE WAS A CONNECTION
BETWEEN US.

38:02.323 --> 38:06.849
VERY POWERFUL ONE.
AT LEAST, I FELT THERE WAS.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.200
BUT SHE WAS GONNA
TELL THE WORLD...

38:10.200 --> 38:11.854
LIKE I ASSAULTED HER.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.730
DEFILED...

38:17.730 --> 38:21.342
LIKE I WAS SOME

38:21.342 --> 38:23.518
DISGUSTING...

38:23.518 --> 38:25.433
THING.

38:25.433 --> 38:30.743
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE VIDEO OF CROSSWHITE?

38:30.743 --> 38:33.398
I HACKED
INTO THE SECURITY FOOTAGE,

38:33.398 --> 38:36.009
CHANGED THE TIME STAMP.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.751
I HAD CROSSWHITE COLD.

38:38.751 --> 38:42.929
AND THAT IDIOT ROWLEY
FORGOT TO FILE THE WARRANT.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.365
SO CROSSWHITE WALKED...

38:44.365 --> 38:47.803
AND LIVED IN A PURGATORY
YOU CREATED FOR HIM

38:47.803 --> 38:50.763
UNTIL HE MET AMBER,
AND SHE FIGURED OUT

38:50.763 --> 38:52.895
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE FOOTAGE?

38:52.895 --> 38:57.335
SAID THE "META-DATA"
DIDN'T MATCH.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.686
SHE HAD NO IDEA
I WAS INVOLVED.

39:00.686 --> 39:04.864
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE HADN'T
TOLD ANYONE ELSE, SO...

39:04.864 --> 39:08.128
I MET HER AT HER HOME.

39:16.223 --> 39:19.574
[gunshots]

39:25.667 --> 39:27.669
AND YOU TOOK HER CAMERAS,

39:27.669 --> 39:30.846
AND YOU PLANTED ONE
AT CROSSWHITE'S.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.848
IN FOR A PENNY.

39:36.112 --> 39:39.899
I THOUGHT THAT...

39:39.899 --> 39:43.293
WHEN I CONFESSED,
I WOULD FEEL A WEIGHT LIFT.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.690
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.783
CROSSWHITE. IT'S TIME.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.136
HEY, UH...

40:00.136 --> 40:02.269
SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE JAIL THING,

40:02.269 --> 40:04.619
BUT YOU DID TAKE
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HOSTAGE.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.186
I DON'T CARE.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.710
JAIL DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
TO ME NOW.

40:08.710 --> 40:12.584
YEAH, WELL, SEE HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT IN A COUPLE YEARS.

40:12.584 --> 40:15.195
I'LL BE FINE.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.285
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

40:18.285 --> 40:21.201
THANK YOU.

40:26.032 --> 40:28.077
[telephone rings in distance]

40:33.518 --> 40:36.608

40:36.608 --> 40:38.566

40:52.014 --> 40:53.973

40:57.063 --> 41:00.849
HOWEVER, BOTH THE BAGSHAWS
ARE HAPPY. EVERYONE'S ALIVE.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.069
WE CAUGHT THE KILLER.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.245
YES, SIR.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.379
SEE, YOU--YOU FIND
THE RIGHT LEVER,

41:09.379 --> 41:13.122
AGENT,
YOU CAN MOVE THE WORLD.

41:13.122 --> 41:15.647
YOU FOUND THE RIGHT LEVER.

41:15.647 --> 41:18.780
THAT WAS A SMART PLAY.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.000
[chuckles]

41:21.000 --> 41:22.871
I HOPE YOU STAY SMART.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.184
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

41:31.184 --> 41:33.969
OH, IT WAS JUST BUSINESS.
WHAT'S THAT?

41:33.969 --> 41:37.190
THIS--THIS IS MY SPEEDING TICKET
THAT I REFUSE TO PAY.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.366
WELL, I'M NOT PAYING IT.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.716
WELL, THEN I GUESS
NO ONE'S GONNA PAY.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.849
I'LL GET BERTRAM TO PAY IT.

41:43.849 --> 41:46.678
[muffled] HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?I HAVE MY WAYS.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.246
[telephone rings in distance]

41:54.729 --> 41:56.601
IT'S ON YOUR DESK!
